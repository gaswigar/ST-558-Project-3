i
the
taking
of
turk
it
was
characteristic
of
philip
quentin
that
he
first
lectured
his
servant
on
the
superiority
of
mind
over
matter
and
then
took
him
cheerfully
by
the
throat
and
threw
him
into
a
far
corner
of
the
room
as
the
servant
was
not
more
than
half
the
size
of
the
master
his
opposition
was
merely
vocal
but
it
was
nevertheless
unmistakable
his
early
career
had
increased
his
vocabulary
and
his
language
was
more
picturesque
than
pretty
yet
of
his
loyalty
and
faithfulness
there
could
be
no
doubt
during
the
seven
years
of
his
service
he
had
been
obliged
to
forget
that
he
possessed
such
a
name
as
turkington
or
even
james
he
had
been
turk
from
the
beginning
and
turk
he
remained
and
in
spite
of
occasional
out
breaks
he
had
proved
his
devotion
to
the
young
gentleman
whose
goods
and
chattels
he
guarded
with
more
assiduity
than
he
did
his
own
soul
or
what
meant
more
to
him
his
personal
comfort
his
employment
came
about
in
an
unusual
way
quentin
had
an
apartment
in
a
smart
building
uptown
one
night
he
was
awakened
by
a
noise
in
his
room
in
the
darkness
he
saw
a
man
fumbling
among
his
things
and
in
an
instant
he
had
seized
his
revolver
from
the
stand
at
his
bedside
and
covered
the
intruder
then
he
calmly
demanded
now
what
are
you
doing
here
i
lookin
for
a
boardin
house
replied
the
other
sullenly
you
just
a
plain
thief
that
well

wo
do
me
no
good
to
say
i
a
sleepwalker
will

suit
of
clothes
and
an
overcoat
and
a
house
and
lot
i
suppose
and
please
do
call
me
again
sit
down
not
oh
the
floor
on
that
chair
over
there
i
going
to
search
you
maybe
you
got
something
i
quentin
turned
on
the
light
and
proceeded
to
disarm
the
man
piling
his
miserable
effects
on
a
chair
take
off
that
mask
lord
put
it
on
again
you
look
much
better
so
you
hungry
are
you
as
a
quentin
never
tried
to
explain
his
subsequent
actions
perhaps
he
had
had
a
stupid
evening
he
merely
yawned
and
addressed
the
burglar
with
all
possible
respect
do
you
imagine
i
permit
any
guest
of
mine
to
go
away
hungry
if
you
wait
till
i
dress
we
stroll
over
to
a
restaurant
in
the
next
street
and
get
some
supper
police
station
you
now
do
be
unkind
burglar
i
mean
supper
for
two
hungry
myself
but
not
a
bit
sleepy
will
you
wait
oh
i
in
no
particular
quentin
dressed
calmly
the
burglar
began
whistling
softly
are
you
ready
asked
philip
putting
on
his
overcoat
and
hat
i
have
got
me
overcoat
on
yet
replied
the
burglar
suggestively
quentin
saw
he
was
dressed
in
the
chilliest
of
rags
he
opened
a
closet
door
and
threw
him
a
long
coat
ah
here
is
your
coat
i
must
have
taken
it
from
the
club
by
mistake
pardon
i
never
expected
to
git
it
back
coolly
replied
the
burglar
donning
the
best
coat
that
had
ever
touched
his
person
you
did
see
anything
of
my
gloves
and
hat
in
there
did
you
a
hat
and
a
pair
of
gloves
were
produced
not
perfect
in
fit
but
quite
respectable
soberly
they
walked
out
into
the
street
and
off
through
the
stillness
the
mystified
burglar
was
losing
his
equanimity
he
could
not
understand
the
captor
motive
nor
could
he
much
longer
curb
his
curiosity
in
his
mind
he
was
fully
satisfied
that
he
was
walking
straight
to
the
portals
of
the
nearest
station
in
all
his
career
as
a
housebreaker
he
had
never
before
been
caught
and
now
to
be
captured
in
such
a
way
and
treated
in
such
a
way
was
far
past
comprehension
ten
minutes
before
he
was
looking
at
a
stalwart
figure
with
a
leveled
revolver
confidently
expecting
to
drop
with
the
bullet
in
his
body
from
an
agitated
weapon
indeed
he
encountered
conditions
so
strange
that
he
felt
a
doubt
of
their
reality
he
had
for
some
peculiar
and
amazing
reason
no
desire
to
escape
there
was
something
in
the
oddness
of
the
proceeding
that
made
him
wish
to
see
it
to
an
end
besides
he
was
quite
sure
the
strapping
young
fellow
would
shoot
if
he
attempted
to
bolt
this
is
a
fairly
good
eating
house
observed
the
victim
as
they
came
to
an
they
entered
and
deliberately
removed
their
coats
the
thief
watching
his
host
with
shifty
even
twinkling
eyes
what
shall
it
be

are
hungry
and
you
may
order
the
entire
bill
from
soup
to
the
date
line
if
you
like
pitch
say
boss
what
your
game
demanded
the
crook
suddenly
his
sharp
pinched
face
with
its
week
growth
of
beard
wore
a
new
expression
that
of
admiration
i
ai
such
a
rube
that

on
and
s
me
gawd
if
you
ai
a
for
half
an
hour
burglar
ate
ravenously
quentin
watching
him
through
amused
eyes
he
had
had
a
dull
monotonous
week
and
this
was
the
novelty
that
lifted
life
out
of
the
torpidity
into
which
it
had
fallen
the
host
at
this
queer
feast
was
at
that
time
little
more
than
years
of
age
a
year
out
of
yale
and
just
back
from
a
second
tour
of
south
america
he
was
an
orphan
coming
into
a
big
fortune
with
his
majority
and
he
had
satiated
an
old
desire
to
travel
in
lands
not
visited
by
all
the
world
now
he
was
back
in
new
york
to
look
after
the
investments
his
guardian
had
made
and
he
found
them
so
ridiculously
satisfactory
that
they
cast
a
shadow
of
dullness
across
his
mind
always
hungry
for
activity
have
you
a
place
to
sleep
he
asked
at
length
i
live
in
jersey
city
but
i
suppose
i
can
find
a
cheap
house
down
by
d
river
trouble
is
i
ai
got
d
then
come
back
home
with
me
you
may
sleep
in
jackson
room
jackson
was
my
man
till
yesterday
when
i
dismissed
him
for
stealing
my
cigars
and
drinking
my
drinks
i
wo
have
anybody
about
me
who
steals
come
then
they
walked
swiftly
back
to
quentin
flat
the
owner
of
the
apartment
directed
his
puzzled
guest
to
a
small
room
off
his
own
and
told
him
to
go
to
bed
by
the
way
what
your
name
he
asked
before
he
closed
the
door
turkington
james
turkington
sir
answered
the
now
respectful
robber
and
he
wanted
to
say
more
but
the
other
interrupted
well
turk
when
you
get
up
in
the
morning
polish
those
shoes
of
mine
over
there
we
talk
it
over
after
i
had
my
breakfast
and
that
is
how
turk
most
faithful
and
loyal
of
servants
began
his
apparently
endless
employment
with
philip
quentin
dabbler
in
stocks
bonds
and
hearts
whatever
his
ugly
past
may
have
been
whatever
his
future
may
have
promised
he
was
honest
to
a
painful
degree
in
these
days
with
quentin
fiery
willful
and
as
ugly
as
a
little
demon
turk
knew
no
law
no
integrity
except
that
which
benefitted
his
employer
beyond
a
doubt
if
quentin
had
instructed
him
to
butcher
a
score
of
men
turk
would
have
proceeded
to
do
so
and
without
argument
but
quentin
instructed
him
to
be
honest
and
cautious
it
would
be
perfectly
safe
to
guess
his
age
between
forty
and
sixty
but
it
would
not
be
wise
to
measure
his
strength
by
the
size
of
his
body
the
little
was
like
a
piece
of
steel
ii
some
rain
and
its
consequences
new
york
had
never
been
so
nasty
and
cold
and
disagreeable
for
three
weeks
it
had
rained
a
steady
chilling
drizzle
quentin
stood
it
as
long
as
he
could
but
the
weather
is
a
large
factor
in
the
life
of
a
gentleman
of
leisure
he
could
play
squash
the
entire
time
and
bridge
he
always
maintained
was
more
of
a
profession
than
a
pastime
so
it
was
that
one
morning
as
he
looked
out
at
the
sheets
of
water
blowing
across
the
city
his
mind
was
made
up
we
get
out
of
this
turk
i
had
enough
of
where
do
we
go
sir
calmly
asked
the
servant
heaven
knows
but
be
ready
to
start
tomorrow
we
go
somewhere
and
dodge
this
blessed
downpour
call
me
a
as
he
drove
to
the
club
he
mentally
tossed
coppers
as
to
his
destination
people
were
already
coming
back
from
aiken
and
palm
beach
and
those
who
had
gone
to
the
country
were
cooped
up
indoors
and
shivering
about
the
fireplaces
where
could
he
go
as
he
entered
the
club
a
man
hailed
him
from
the
front
room
quentin
you
just
the
man
i
looking
for
come
in
it
was
the
earl
of
saxondale
familiarly
lord
bob
an
old
chum
of
quentin
my
missus
sent
me
with
an
invitation
for
you
and
come
for
your
acceptance
said
the
englishman
when
quentin
had
joined
him
come
home
with
us
we
sailing
on
the
lucania
and
there
are
going
to
be
some
doings
in
england
this
month
which
you
must
miss
dickey
savage
is
coming
and
we
want
quentin
looked
at
him
and
laughed
saxondale
was
perfectly
serious
we
going
to
have
some
people
up
for
goodwood
and
later
we
shall
have
a
for
henley
so
you
better
come
it
wo
be
bad
quentin
started
to
thank
his
friend
and
decline
then
he
remembered
that
he
wanted
to
get
away
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
keep
him
at
home
and
besides
he
liked
lord
bob
and
his
american
wife
fashionable
new
york
recalls
the
marriage
of
the
earl
of
saxondale
and
frances
thornow
when
the
were
young
and
everybody
said
it
was
a
love
match
to
be
sure
she
was
wealthy
but
so
was
he
she
had
declined
offers
of
a
other
noblemen
therefore
it
was
not
ambition
on
her
part
he
could
have
married
any
number
of
wealthier
american
girls
therefore
it
was
not
avarice
on
his
part
he
was
a
stalwart
chap
with
a
very
fetching
drawl
infinite
gentility
and
a
man
despite
his
monocle
while
she
was
beautiful
witty
and
womanly
therefore
it
is
reasonable
to
suspect
that
it
must
have
been
love
that
made
her
lady
saxondale
lord
bob
and
lady
frances
were
frequent
visitors
to
new
york
he
liked
new
york
and
new
yorkers
liked
him
his
wife
was
enough
of
a
true
american
to
love
the
home
of
her
forefathers
what
my
wife
likes
i
seem
to
have
a
fondness
for
said
he
complacently
he
once
remarked
that
were
she
to
fall
in
love
with
another
man
he
would
feel
in
duty
bound
to
like
him
saxondale
had
money
invested
in
american
copper
mines
and
his
wife
had
railroad
stocks
when
they
came
to
new
york
once
or
twice
a
year
they
took
a
furnished
apartment
entertained
and
were
entertained
for
a
month
or
so
rushed
their
luggage
back
to
the
steamer
and
sailed
for
home
perfectly
satisfied
with
themselves
and
the
markets
quentin
looked
upon
lord
bob
invitation
as
a
sporting
proposition
this
would
not
be
the
first
time
he
had
taken
a
steamer
on
hours
notice
the
one
question
was
accommodation
and
a
long
acquaintance
with
the
agent
helped
him
to
get
passage
where
others
would
have
failed
so
it
happened
that
the
next
morning
turk
was
unpacking
things
in
quentin
cabin
and
establishing
relations
with
the
bath
steward
iii
prince
ugo
several
days
out
from
new
york
found
the
weather
fine
and
lord
saxondale
party
enjoying
life
thoroughly
dickey
and
the
capricious
lady
jane
were
bright
or
squally
with
charming
uncertainty
lady
jane
lord
bob
sister
certainly
was
not
in
love
with
savage
and
he
was
too
indolent
to
give
his
side
of
the
case
continuous
thought
dimly
he
realized
and
once
lugubriously
admitted
that
he
was
not
quite
heartwhole
but
he
had
not
reached
a
positive
understanding
with
himself
how
do
they
steer
the
ship
at
night
when
it
is
so
cloudy
they
see
the
north
star
she
asked
as
they
leaned
over
the
rail
one
afternoon
her
pretty
face
was
very
serious
and
there
was
a
philosophical
pucker
on
her
brow
with
a
rudder
he
answered
laconically
how
very
odd
she
said
with
a
malicious
gleam
in
her
eyes
you
are
as
wonderfully
concerning
the
sea
as
you
are
on
all
other
subjects
how
good
it
must
seem
to
be
so
awfully
it
is
often
that
i
find
anyone
who
asks
really
intelligent
questions
you
know
lady
jane
your
profound
quest
for
knowledge
forced
my
dormant
intellect
into
action
and
i
remembered
that
a
ship
invariably
has
a
rudder
or
something
like
i
see
it
requires
the
weightiest
of
questions
to
arouse
your
the
wind
was
blowing
the
stray
hairs
ruthlessly
across
her
face
and
she
looked
very
very
pretty
intellects
are
so
very
common
nowadays
that
anything
will
arouse
them
quentin
says
his
man
turk
has
a
brain
and
if
turk
has
a
brain
i
do
see
how
the
rest
of
us
can
escape
i
like
to
be
a
what
an
ambition
why
not
a
whale
or
a
shark
if
i
were
a
shark
you
be
afraid
of
me
and
if
i
were
a
whale
i
could
not
begin
to
get
into
your
that
the
best
thing
you
said
since
you
were
seasick
she
said
sweetly
i
glad
you
did
hear
what
i
said
when
i
was
oh
i
heard
brother
bob
say
things
loftily
but
nobody
can
say
things
quite
so
impressively
as
an
pooh
you
boasting
americans
think
you
can
do
everything
better
than
others
now
you
claim
that
you
can
swear
better
i
wo
listen
to
you
and
off
she
went
toward
the
companionway
dickey
looked
mildly
surprised
but
did
not
follow
instead
he
joined
lady
saxondale
and
quentin
in
a
stroll
four
days
later
they
were
comfortably
established
with
saxondale
in
london
that
night
quentin
met
for
the
first
time
the
reigning
society
sensation
prince
ugo
ravorelli
and
his
countrymen
count
sallaconi
and
the
duke
of
laselli
all
london
had
gone
mad
over
the
prince
there
was
something
oddly
familiar
in
the
face
and
voice
of
the
italian
quentin
sat
with
him
for
an
hour
listening
with
puzzled
ears
to
the
conversation
that
went
on
between
him
and
saxondale
on
several
occasions
he
detected
a
curious
searching
look
in
the
italian
dark
eyes
and
was
convinced
that
the
prince
also
had
the
impression
that
they
had
met
before
at
last
quentin
unable
to
curb
his
curiosity
expressed
his
doubt
ravorelli
gaze
was
penetrating
as
he
replied
but
it
was
perfectly
frank
i
have
the
feeling
that
your
face
is
not
strange
to
me
yet
i
can
not
recall
when
or
where
i
have
seen
you
have
you
been
in
paris
of
late
he
asked
his
english
almost
perfect
it
seemed
to
quentin
that
there
was
a
look
of
relief
in
his
dark
eyes
and
there
was
a
trace
of
satisfaction
in
the
long
breath
that
followed
the
question
no
he
replied
i
seem
in
some
way
to
associate
you
with
brazil
and
the
south
american
cities
were
you
ever
in
rio
janeiro
i
have
never
visited
either
of
the
americas
we
are
doubtless
misled
by
a
strange
resemblance
to
persons
we
know
quite
well
but
who
do
not
come
to
but
is
it
rather
odd
that
we
should
have
the
same
feeling
and
you
have
not
been
in
new
york
persisted
phil
i
have
not
been
in
america
at
all
you
must
remember
replied
the
prince
coldly
i
stake
my
soul
on
it
thought
quentin
to
himself
more
fully
convinced
than
ever
i
seen
him
before
and
more
than
once
too
he
remembers
me
even
though
i
ca
place
him
it
devilish
aggravating
but
his
face
is
as
familiar
as
if
i
saw
him
when
they
parted
for
the
night
ravorelli
glance
again
impressed
the
american
with
a
certainty
that
he
at
least
was
not
in
doubt
as
to
where
and
when
they
had
met
you
are
trying
to
recall
where
we
have
seen
one
another
said
the
prince
smiling
easily
his
white
teeth
showing
clearly
between
smooth
lips
my
cousin
visited
america
some
years
ago
and
there
is
a
strong
family
resemblance
possibly
you
have
our
faces
that
may
be
the
solution
admitted
phil
but
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
by
the
hypothesis
in
the
cab
later
on
lord
bob
was
startled
from
a
bit
of
doze
by
hearing
his
thoughtful
abstracted
companion
exclaim
by
thunder
what
up
forgot
your
hat
or
left
something
at
the
club
he
demanded
sleepily
no
i
remember
something
that
all
bob
i
know
where
i
seen
that
italian
prince
he
was
in
rio
janeiro
with
a
big
italian
opera
company
just
before
i
left
there
for
new
what
but
he
said
he
never
been
in
america
exclaimed
saxondale
wide
awake
well
he
lied
that
all
i
am
positive
he
the
man
and
the
best
proof
in
the
world
is
the
certainty
that
he
remembers
me
of
course
he
denies
it
but
you
know
what
he
said
when
i
first
asked
him
if
we
had
met
he
was
the
tenor
in
pagani
opera
company
and
he
sang
in
several
of
the
big
south
american
cities
they
were
in
rio
janeiro
for
weeks
and
we
lived
in
the
same
hotel
there
no
mistake
about
it
old
man
this
howling
swell
of
was
pagani
tenor
and
he
was
a
good
one
too
gad
what
a
romeo
he
was
imagine
him
in
the
part
bob
lord
how
the
women
raved
about
him
i
say
phil
do
be
ass
enough
to
tell
anybody
else
about
this
even
if
you
cocksure
he
the
man
he
was
doubtless
driven
to
the
stage
for
financial
reasons
you
know
and
it
would
be
quite
right
to
bring
it
up
now
if
he
has
a
desire
to
suppress
the
truth
since
he
has
come
into
the
title
and
estates
it
might
be
deuced
awkward
to
have
that
sort
of
a
past
raked
i
should
say
it
would
be
awkward
if
that
part
of
his
past
were
raked
up
he
was
a
puritan
they
are
a
bit
scarce
at
he
was
known
in
those
days
as
giovanni
pavesi
and
he
was
in
such
dire
financial
straits
either
it
was
his
money
that
backed
the
enterprise
and
it
was
common
property
undenied
by
him
or
anyone
else
that
the
chief
object
in
the
speculation
was
the
love
of
the
prima
donna
carmenita
malban
and
bob
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
saw
the
story
was
that
she
was
a
countess
or
something
of
the
sort
poverty
forced
her
to
make
use
of
a
glorious
voice
and
the
devil
sent
pagani
to
young
pavesi
who
was
then
a
student
with
some
ripping
big
master
in
the
hope
that
he
would
interest
the
young
man
in
a
scheme
to
tour
south
america
it
seems
that
signorita
malban
beauty
set
his
heart
on
fire
and
he
promptly
produced
the
coin
to
back
the
enterprise
the
only
condition
being
that
he
was
to
sing
the
tenor
roles
all
this
came
out
in
the
trial
you
the
trial
what
trial
giovanni
let
me
think
a
minute
she
was
killed
on
the
of
march
and
he
was
not
arrested
until
they
had
virtually
convicted
one
of
the
chorus
men
of
the
murder
pagani
and
pavesi
quarrelled
and
the
former
openly
accused
his
of
the
crime
this
led
to
an
arrest
just
as
the
tenor
was
getting
away
on
a
ship
bound
for
arrested
him
for
the
murder
of
the
woman
on
my
life
quentin
you
make
a
serious
blunder
unless
you
can
prove
all
this
when
did
it
all
happen
two
years
ago
oh
i
not
mistaken
about
it
it
is
as
clear
as
sunlight
to
me
now
they
took
him
back
and
tried
him
members
of
the
troupe
swore
he
had
threatened
on
numerous
occasions
to
kill
her
if
she
continued
to
repulse
him
on
the
night
of
the
murder
it
was
after
the
opera
he
was
heard
to
threaten
her
she
defied
him
and
one
of
the
women
in
the
company
testified
that
he
sought
to
intimidate
malban
by
placing
the
point
of
his
stiletto
against
her
white
neck
but
in
spite
of
all
this
he
was
acquitted
i
was
in
new
york
when
the
trial
ended
but
i
read
of
the
verdict
in
the
press
dispatches
some
one
killed
her
that
is
certain
and
the
nasty
job
was
done
in
her
room
at
the
hotel
i
heard
some
of
the
evidence
and
i
say
that
i
believed
he
was
the
guilty
man
but
i
considered
him
insane
when
he
committed
the
crime
he
loved
her
to
the
point
of
madness
and
she
would
not
yield
to
his
passion
it
was
shown
that
she
loved
the
chorus
singer
who
was
first
charged
with
her
ravorelli
does
look
like
a
murderer
said
lord
bob
stoutly
but
he
remembers
seeing
me
in
that
courtroom
iv
and
the
girl
too
now
tell
me
all
about
our
italian
friend
said
quentin
next
morning
to
lady
frances
who
had
not
lost
her
frank
americanism
when
she
married
lord
bob
the
handsome
face
of
the
young
prince
had
been
in
his
thoughts
the
night
before
until
sleep
came
and
then
there
were
dreams
in
which
the
same
face
appeared
vaguely
sinister
and
foreboding
he
had
acted
on
the
advice
of
lord
bob
and
had
said
nothing
of
the
brazilian
experiences
prince
ugo
i
supposed
that
every
newspaper
in
new
york
had
been
devoting
columns
to
him
he
is
to
marry
an
american
heiress
and
some
of
the
london
journals
say
she
is
so
rich
that
everybody
else
looks
poor
beside
lucky
dog
eh
everybody
admires
him
too
it
seems
do
you
know
him
frances
i
met
him
a
number
of
times
on
the
continent
but
not
often
in
london
he
is
seldom
here
you
know
really
he
is
quite
a
charming
yes
laconically
are
italian
princes
as
cheap
as
they
used
to
be
mary
carrolton
got
that
nasty
little
one
of
hers
for
two
hundred
thousand
did
she
this
one
looks
as
though
he
might
come
a
little
higher
he
oh
ugo
is
not
like
the
carrolton
investment
you
see
this
one
is
vastly
rich
and
he
no
end
of
a
swell
in
sunny
italy
really
the
match
is
the
best
an
american
girl
has
made
over
here
in
oh
in
centuries
i
may
pocahontas
made
a
fairly
decent
one
i
believe
and
so
did
frances
thornow
but
to
my
limited
knowledge
i
think
they
are
the
only
satisfactory
matches
that
have
been
pulled
off
in
the
last
few
centuries
strange
they
both
married
thank
you
you
do
like
italian
princes
then
oh
if
i
could
buy
a
steady
tractable
one
i
take
him
as
an
investment
perhaps
but
i
believe
on
the
whole
rather
put
the
money
into
a
general
menagerie
like
barnum
or
forepaugh
you
get
such
a
variety
of
beasts
that
way
you
come
now
phil
your
sarcasm
is
unjust
prince
ugo
is
very
much
of
a
gentleman
and
bob
says
he
is
very
clever
too
did
you
see
much
of
him
last
night
i
saw
him
at
the
club
and
talked
a
bit
with
him
then
i
saw
him
while
i
slept
he
is
much
better
in
the
club
than
he
is
in
a
you
dreamed
of
him
last
night
he
certainly
made
an
impression
then
she
said
i
dreamed
i
saw
him
abusing
a
harmless
overworked
and
underfed
little
monkey
on
the
streets
of
new
how
absurd
the
monkey
would
climb
up
to
the
window
of
my
apartment
to
collect
nickels
for
the
vilest
music
a
man
ever
heard
even
in
a
phil
quentin
you
are
manufacturing
that
dream
as
you
sit
here
wait
till
you
know
him
better
and
you
will
like
his
friends
too
one
of
those
chaps
looks
as
if
he
might
throw
a
bomb
with
beautiful
accuracy
the
laselli
duke
i
think
come
now
frances
you
admit
he
an
ugly
brute
wo
you
yes
you
are
quite
right
and
i
ca
say
that
the
count
impresses
me
more
i
stake
my
head
the
duke
ancestors
were
brigands
or
something
equally
appalling
a
couple
of
poor
foolish
american
girls
elevate
them
both
to
the
position
of
though
i
presume
and
the
newspapers
will
at
dinner
that
evening
the
discussion
was
resumed
all
those
at
the
table
taking
part
the
tall
young
american
was
plainly
prejudiced
against
the
italian
but
his
stand
was
a
mystery
to
all
save
lord
bob
dickey
savage
was
laboriously
until
lady
jane
took
sides
unequivocally
with
quentin
then
he
vigorously
defended
the
unlucky
prince
lady
saxondale
and
sir
james
graham
one
of
the
guests
took
pains
to
place
the
italian
in
the
best
light
possible
before
the
critical
american
i
almost
forgot
to
tell
you
phil
suddenly
cried
lady
saxondale
her
pretty
face
beaming
with
excitement
the
girl
he
is
to
marry
is
an
old
flame
of
quite
impossible
lady
frances
i
never
had
a
but
she
was
i
are
you
a
theosophist
asked
phil
gaily
but
he
listened
nevertheless
who
could
she
be
it
seemed
for
the
moment
as
his
mind
swept
backward
that
he
had
possessed
a
hundred
sweethearts
i
had
no
sweetheart
since
i
began
existence
in
the
present
good
lord
ejaculated
dickey
solemnly
and
impressively
i
bet
my
soul
frances
is
right
drawled
lord
bob
she
always
is
you
know
my
boy
if
she
says
you
had
a
sweetheart
you
either
had
one
or
somebody
owes
you
one
you
never
collected
if
he
collected
them
he
have
a
harem
observed
savage
sagely
he
had
so
many
he
ca
count
i
should
think
it
disgusting
to
count
them
savage
even
if
he
could
said
lady
jane
severely
i
can
count
mine
backwards
he
said
beginning
at
one
yes
lady
jane
one
in
my
teens
none
at
present
no
task
at
all
to
count
wo
you
give
me
the
name
of
that
old
sweetheart
of
mine
lady
saxondale
whom
is
the
prince
to
marry
asked
quentin
dorothy
garrison
she
lived
in
your
block
seven
or
eight
years
ago
up
to
the
time
she
went
to
brussels
with
her
mother
now
do
you
remember
you
do
mean
it
little
dorothy
by
george
she
was
a
pretty
girl
too
of
course
i
remember
her
but
that
was
ages
ago
she
was
fourteen
and
i
was
nineteen
you
are
right
lady
saxondale
confess
to
having
regarded
her
as
the
fairest
creature
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
for
six
solid
delicious
months
she
was
the
foundation
of
every
thought
that
touched
my
brain
and
then
well
what
happened
then
oh
yes
we
quarrelled
and
forgot
each
other
so
she
the
girl
who
to
marry
the
prince
is
she
quentin
face
was
serious
for
the
moment
a
look
of
real
concern
came
into
his
eyes
he
was
recalling
a
sweet
dainty
face
a
girlish
figure
and
the
days
gone
by
how
odd
i
did
not
think
of
it
before
really
you
two
were
dreadful
spoons
in
those
days
mamma
used
to
worry
for
fear
you
carry
out
your
threat
to
run
away
with
her
and
now
she
to
be
a
real
live
lady
frances
created
a
profound
sensation
when
she
resurrected
quentin
boyhood
love
affair
with
the
one
american
girl
that
all
europe
talked
about
at
that
moment
lord
bob
was
excited
perhaps
for
the
first
time
since
he
proposed
to
frances
thornow
by
jove
old
man
this
is
rare
devilish
rare
no
wonder
you
have
such
a
deuced
antipathy
to
the
prince
intuition
must
have
told
you
that
he
was
to
marry
one
of
the
ladies
of
your
why
bob
we
were
children
and
there
was
nothing
to
it
truly
i
had
forgotten
that
pretty
child
that
all
she
was
and
i
warrant
she
would
remember
my
name
if
some
one
spoke
it
in
her
presence
every
boy
and
girl
has
had
that
sort
of
an
she
the
most
beautiful
creature
i
ever
saw
cried
lady
jane
ecstatically
dickey
savage
looked
sharply
at
her
vivacious
face
when
did
you
last
see
her
quentin
i
ca
recall
but
i
know
it
was
when
her
hair
hung
down
her
back
she
left
new
york
before
she
was
fifteen
i
quite
sure
i
think
i
was
in
love
with
a
young
widow
fourteen
years
my
senior
at
the
time
and
did
not
pay
much
heed
to
dorothy
departure
she
and
her
mother
have
been
traveling
since
then
they
traveled
for
three
years
before
garrison
could
make
up
her
mind
to
settle
down
in
brussels
i
believe
she
said
it
reminded
her
of
paris
only
it
was
a
little
more
so
said
lord
bob
we
met
them
in
paris
five
years
ago
on
our
wedding
trip
and
she
was
undecided
until
i
told
her
she
might
take
a
house
near
the
palace
in
brussels
such
as
it
is
and
off
she
flew
to
be
as
close
to
the
crown
as
possible
she
struck
me
as
a
gory
old
party
who
could
live
comfortably
unless
she
were
dabbling
in
blue
blood
the
girl
was
charming
she
in
london
now
ventured
sir
james
the
papers
say
she
came
especially
to
see
the
boat
races
but
there
is
a
pretty
well
established
belief
that
she
came
because
the
prince
is
here
despite
their
millions
i
understand
it
is
a
love
i
hope
i
may
have
a
look
at
her
while
i
here
just
to
see
what
time
has
done
for
her
said
quentin
you
may
have
the
chance
to
ask
if
she
remembers
you
said
dickey
and
if
she
thinks
you
grown
older
added
lord
bob
will
you
tell
her
you
are
not
married
demanded
lady
jane
i
do
but
one
thing
judging
from
the
way
you
describe
the
goddess
just
stand
with
open
mouth
and
marvel
at
her
magnificence
somewhere
among
my
traps
i
have
a
picture
of
her
when
she
was
fourteen
taken
with
me
one
afternoon
at
a
if
i
can
find
it
i
show
it
to
her
just
to
prove
that
we
both
lived
ten
years
ago
she
doubtless
lived
so
much
since
i
saw
her
last
that
she
deny
an
existence
so
far
back
as
you
wo
be
so
deuced
sarcastic
when
you
see
her
even
if
she
is
to
marry
a
prince
i
tell
you
phil
she
is
something
worth
looking
at
forever
said
lord
bob
i
never
saw
such
eyes
such
a
complexion
such
hair
such
a
carriage
cried
lady
frances
has
she
any
teeth
asked
dickey
and
was
properly
frowned
upon
by
lady
jane
you
describe
her
as
completely
in
that
sentence
lady
frances
as
a
novelist
could
in
eight
pages
said
quentin
no
novelist
could
describe
her
was
the
answer
it
to
be
hoped
no
novelist
may
attempt
it
said
quentin
she
is
beautiful
beyond
description
she
will
be
a
princess
and
she
knew
me
when
i
did
know
enough
to
appreciate
her
her
eyes
were
blue
in
the
old
days
and
her
hair
was
almost
black
colors
still
obtain
then
we
have
her
description
in
advance
now
let
go
on
with
the
a
sunday
encounter
it
was
a
sunny
sunday
morning
and
the
church
parade
was
popular
lady
frances
and
quentin
were
walking
together
when
prince
ugo
joined
them
he
looked
hardly
over
his
wavy
black
hair
giving
him
a
picturesque
look
he
wore
no
beard
and
his
dark
skin
was
as
clear
as
a
girl
by
the
way
said
quentin
lady
saxondale
tells
me
you
are
to
marry
a
former
acquaintance
of
miss
garrison
is
an
acquaintance
cried
the
prince
lifting
his
dark
eyes
an
instant
later
his
gaze
roamed
away
into
the
horde
of
passing
women
as
if
searching
for
the
woman
whose
name
brought
light
to
his
soul
was
an
acquaintance
i
think
i
said
i
doubt
if
she
remembers
me
now
she
was
a
child
when
i
knew
her
is
she
here
this
morning
asked
phil
secretly
amused
by
the
anxious
look
in
the
eyes
she
will
be
with
lady
marnham
ah
i
see
them
the
young
prince
was
looking
eagerly
ahead
quentin
saw
miss
garrison
and
gasped
with
astonishment
could
that
stunning
young
woman
be
the
little
dorothy
of
new
york
days
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
and
ears
notwithstanding
the
introductions
which
followed
and
here
is
an
old
new
york
friend
miss
garrison
philip
quentin
you
surely
remember
him
miss
garrison
said
lady
frances
with
a
peculiar
gleam
in
her
eye
for
a
second
the
young
lady
at
quentin
side
exhibited
surprise
a
faint
flush
swept
into
her
cheek
and
then
with
a
rare
smile
she
extended
her
hand
to
the
american
of
course
i
remember
him
phil
and
i
were
playmates
in
the
old
days
dear
me
it
seems
a
century
ago
she
said
i
can
not
tell
you
how
well
the
century
has
treated
you
he
said
gallantly
it
has
not
been
so
kind
to
years
are
never
unkind
to
men
she
responded
she
smiled
upon
the
adoring
prince
and
turned
again
to
quentin
tell
me
about
new
york
phil
tell
me
about
i
can
only
say
that
new
york
has
grown
larger
and
better
and
that
i
have
grown
older
and
worse
garrison
may
doubt
that
i
could
possibly
grow
worse
but
i
have
proof
positive
i
am
dabbling
in
wall
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
reprehensible
said
garrison
amiably
quentin
swiftly
renewed
his
opinion
of
the
mother
that
estimate
coincided
with
the
impression
his
youth
had
formed
and
it
was
not
far
in
the
wrong
here
was
the
mother
with
a
hope
loftier
than
a
soul
ambitious
condescending
to
a
degree
a
woman
who
would
achieve
what
she
set
out
to
do
at
all
hazards
less
than
fifty
still
handsome
haughty
and
arrogant
descended
through
a
long
line
of
american
aristocracy
calm
resourceful
heartless
for
fifteen
years
a
widow
with
no
other
object
than
to
live
at
the
top
and
to
marry
her
only
child
into
a
realm
far
beyond
the
dreams
of
other
american
mothers
millions
had
she
to
flaunt
in
the
faces
of
an
astonished
marveling
people
clever
tactful
aggressive
capable
of
winning
where
others
had
failed
this
american
mother
was
respected
even
admired
in
the
class
to
which
she
had
climbed
here
was
the
woman
who
had
won
her
way
into
continental
society
as
have
few
of
her
countrywomen
to
none
save
a
cold
discerning
man
from
her
own
land
was
she
transparent
lord
bob
however
had
a
faint
conception
of
her
aims
her
capacity
as
they
walked
on
quentin
scarcely
took
his
eyes
from
miss
garrison
face
he
was
wearing
down
the
surprise
that
the
sweetheart
of
his
boyhood
had
inspired
by
deliberately
seeking
flaws
in
her
beauty
her
figure
her
manner
after
a
time
he
felt
her
more
wonderful
than
ever
lord
bob
joined
the
party
and
quentin
stopped
a
second
to
speak
to
him
as
he
did
so
prince
ugo
was
at
miss
garrison
side
in
an
instant
so
she
is
the
girl
that
damned
italian
is
to
elevate
said
quentin
to
himself
by
george
it
a
shame
he
did
not
see
lord
bob
and
his
wife
exchange
a
quick
smile
of
significance
as
they
all
reached
the
corner
quentin
asked
are
you
in
london
for
long
dorothy
lady
frances
thought
his
tone
a
trifle
eager
for
ten
days
or
so
will
you
come
to
see
me
their
eyes
met
and
he
felt
certain
that
the
invitation
was
sincerely
given
lady
marnham
is
having
some
people
in
afternoon
perhaps
you
come
then
she
added
and
phil
looked
crestfallen
i
come
he
said
i
want
to
tell
you
the
story
of
my
past
life
you
did
know
i
been
prime
minister
of
a
south
american
republic
did
you
she
nodded
and
they
separated
prince
ugo
heard
the
last
words
of
the
american
and
a
small
clear
line
appeared
for
an
instant
between
his
black
eyebrows
lady
frances
solemnly
and
secretively
shook
her
finger
at
quentin
and
he
laughed
with
the
disdain
of
one
who
understands
and
denies
without
the
use
of
words
lord
bob
had
wanted
to
kick
him
when
he
mentioned
south
america
but
he
said
nothing
quentin
was
in
wonderful
spirits
all
the
way
home
vi
dorothy
garrison
quentin
was
driving
with
lady
saxondale
to
the
home
of
miss
garrison
hostess
phil
fair
calculating
companion
said
to
herself
that
she
had
never
seen
a
handsomer
fellow
than
this
stalwart
american
there
was
about
him
that
clean
strong
sweet
look
of
the
absolutely
healthy
man
the
man
who
has
buffeted
the
world
and
not
been
buffeted
by
the
world
he
was
frank
bright
straightforward
and
there
was
that
yet
gleam
of
mastery
in
his
eye
it
may
have
been
sometimes
a
wicked
mastery
and
more
than
one
woman
who
admired
him
because
she
could
not
help
herself
had
said
there
is
a
devil
in
his
they
found
lady
marnham
reception
hall
full
of
guests
few
of
whom
quentin
had
seen
before
he
was
relieved
to
find
that
the
prince
was
not
present
and
he
made
his
way
to
dorothy
side
with
lady
frances
coolly
dropping
into
the
chair
which
a
young
captain
had
momentarily
abandoned
lady
frances
sat
beside
miss
garrison
on
the
divan
i
am
so
glad
you
kept
your
promise
phil
and
came
it
seems
good
to
see
you
after
all
these
years
you
bring
back
the
dear
days
at
home
said
dorothy
delight
in
her
voice
from
that
i
judge
you
sometimes
long
for
them
he
said
simply
to
lady
frances
it
sounded
daring
often
oh
so
very
often
i
have
not
been
in
new
york
for
years
lady
saxondale
goes
back
so
often
that
she
does
have
the
chance
to
grow
i
hear
you
are
going
over
this
fall
said
quentin
with
a
fair
show
of
interest
who
who
told
you
so
she
asked
in
some
surprise
he
could
not
detect
confusion
prince
ravorelli
at
least
he
said
he
expected
to
make
the
trip
this
fall
am
i
wrong
in
suspecting
that
he
is
not
going
alone
we
mean
to
spend
much
of
the
winter
in
the
united
states
chiefly
in
florida
i
shall
depend
on
you
phil
to
be
nice
to
him
in
new
york
you
can
do
so
much
to
make
it
pleasant
for
him
he
has
never
been
in
new
york
you
it
may
depend
on
what
he
will
consider
pleasant
i
do
believe
he
will
enjoy
all
the
things
i
like
but
i
try
i
get
dickey
savage
to
give
a
dinner
for
him
and
if
he
can
survive
that
capable
of
having
a
good
time
anywhere
dickey
dinners
are
the
real
test
you
know
americans
stand
them
because
they
are
rugged
and
accustomed
to
you
will
find
prince
ugo
rugged
she
said
flushing
slightly
and
he
imagined
he
could
distinguish
a
softness
in
her
tone
i
am
told
he
is
an
athlete
a
great
horseman
a
marvelous
swordsman
said
lady
frances
i
am
glad
you
have
heard
something
about
him
that
is
true
said
dorothy
a
trifle
quickly
usually
they
say
that
princes
are
all
that
is
detestable
and
unmanly
i
am
sure
you
will
like
him
garrison
came
up
at
this
moment
with
lady
marnham
and
quentin
arose
to
greet
the
former
as
warmly
as
he
could
under
the
smooth
veil
of
hypocrisy
again
just
before
lady
frances
signaled
to
him
that
it
was
time
for
them
to
leave
he
found
himself
in
conversation
over
the
teacups
with
dorothy
garrison
this
time
they
were
quite
alone
it
does
seem
possible
that
you
are
the
same
dorothy
garrison
i
used
to
know
he
said
reflectively
have
i
changed
so
much
she
asked
and
there
was
in
her
manner
an
icy
barrier
that
would
have
checked
a
less
confident
man
than
philip
quentin
in
every
way
you
were
charming
in
those
and
not
charming
now
i
you
are
more
than
charming
now
that
is
hardly
a
change
however
is
it
then
you
were
very
pretty
now
you
are
beautiful
then
you
were
i
do
like
flattery
phil
she
said
hurt
by
what
she
felt
to
be
an
indifferent
effort
on
his
part
to
please
her
vanity
i
am
quite
sure
you
remember
me
well
enough
to
know
that
i
never
said
nice
things
unless
i
meant
them
but
now
that
i
think
of
it
it
is
the
height
of
impropriety
to
speak
so
plainly
even
to
an
old
friend
and
an
old
er
wo
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
she
asked
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
the
merest
stranger
and
had
never
seen
her
till
this
hour
a
dozen
if
it
pleases
you
he
said
laughingly
looking
straight
into
the
dark
eyes
she
was
striving
so
hard
to
keep
cold
and
unfriendly
then
you
must
come
another
day
she
answered
brightly
i
can
not
come
he
said
i
did
not
say
but
i
come
on
friday
he
went
on
decisively
she
looked
concerned
for
an
instant
and
then
smiled
lady
marnham
will
give
you
tea
on
friday
i
shall
not
be
at
home
she
said
but
i
am
going
back
to
new
york
next
week
he
said
confidently
next
week
are
you
so
busy
i
am
not
anxious
to
return
but
my
man
turk
says
he
hates
london
he
says
he
leave
me
if
i
stay
here
a
month
i
ca
afford
to
lose
and
he
ca
afford
to
lose
you
stay
phil
the
saxondales
are
such
jolly
how
about
the
tea
on
friday
oh
that
is
no
but
it
is
you
know
you
used
to
give
me
tea
every
day
in
the
he
saw
at
once
that
he
had
gone
beyond
the
lines
and
drew
back
wisely
let
me
come
on
friday
and
we
have
a
good
sensible
on
that
one
condition
she
said
earnestly
thank
you
i
see
lady
frances
is
ready
to
go
evidently
i
have
monopolized
you
to
a
somewhat
thoughtless
extent
everybody
is
looking
daggers
at
me
including
the
prince
who
came
in
ten
minutes
he
arose
and
held
her
hand
for
a
moment
at
parting
her
swift
abashed
glance
toward
prince
ugo
whose
presence
she
had
not
observed
did
not
escape
his
eyes
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
peculiar
smile
on
quentin
lips
and
there
was
deep
meaning
in
her
next
remark
to
him
you
will
meet
the
prince
here
on
friday
i
shall
ask
him
to
come
early
that
he
may
learn
to
know
you
thank
you
i
like
to
know
him
better
at
what
hour
is
he
to
come
by
at
least
she
said
pointedly
too
early
to
be
correct
you
suspect
i
think
not
you
may
expect
me
before
three
i
am
not
a
stickler
for
we
shall
not
serve
tea
until
four
she
said
coldly
that
my
hour
for
tea
just
my
hour
he
said
blithely
she
could
not
repress
the
smile
that
his
old
willfulness
brought
to
her
lips
and
eyes
thank
you
for
the
smile
it
was
worth
struggling
he
was
gone
before
she
could
respond
but
the
smile
lingered
as
her
eyes
followed
his
tall
figure
across
the
room
she
saw
him
pause
and
speak
to
prince
ugo
and
then
pass
out
with
lady
saxondale
only
lady
saxondale
observed
the
dark
gleam
in
the
italian
eyes
as
he
responded
to
the
big
american
unconventional
greeting
on
the
way
home
she
found
herself
wondering
if
dorothy
had
ever
spoken
to
the
prince
of
philip
quentin
and
those
tender
foolish
days
of
girlhood
has
she
lost
any
of
the
charm
she
asked
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
to
find
out
on
are
you
going
back
on
friday
in
surprise
to
drink
tea
you
did
she
ask
you
to
come
ca
remember
but
i
think
i
suggested
be
careful
phil
i
do
want
you
to
turn
dorothy
you
compliment
me
by
even
suspecting
that
i
could
her
head
is
set
it
ca
be
turned
it
is
set
for
that
beautiful
bejewelled
thing
they
call
a
coronet
besides
i
do
want
to
turn
i
think
the
prince
could
become
very
jealous
she
went
on
earnestly
which
would
mean
stilettos
for
two
i
after
a
contemplative
silence
he
said
by
jove
she
is
beautiful
quentin
was
always
the
man
to
rush
headlong
into
the
very
thickest
of
whatever
won
his
interest
whether
it
was
the
tender
encounter
of
the
or
the
dangerous
conflict
of
the
field
when
he
left
lady
marnham
house
late
on
friday
afternoon
he
was
more
delighted
than
ever
with
the
girl
he
had
once
loved
he
was
with
her
for
nearly
an
hour
before
the
prince
arrived
and
he
had
boldly
dashed
into
the
he
called
them
ridiculous
days
when
she
had
been
his
little
sweetheart
the
days
when
both
had
sworn
with
young
fervor
to
be
true
till
death
she
did
not
take
kindly
at
first
to
these
references
to
that
early
mistaken
affection
but
his
persistence
won
before
the
prince
arrived
the
american
had
learned
how
she
met
him
how
he
had
wooed
and
won
and
how
she
had
inspired
jealousy
in
his
hot
italian
heart
by
speaking
of
the
big
handsome
boy
over
in
new
york
he
secured
her
permission
to
join
her
in
the
row
on
tuesday
there
was
resistance
on
her
part
at
first
but
he
laughed
it
off
you
should
ask
me
to
your
wedding
he
said
as
the
prince
came
in
but
you
will
not
be
i
changed
my
mind
he
said
calmly
and
then
smiled
into
her
puzzled
eyes
brussels
is
it
yes
the
middle
of
september
she
said
dreamily
you
ask
me
to
come
i
should
have
asked
you
the
two
men
shook
hands
sorry
i
ca
stay
for
tea
dorothy
but
i
promised
lord
saxondale
i
meet
him
at
four
he
did
a
genuinely
american
thing
as
he
walked
up
the
street
he
whistled
a
lively
air
vii
the
woman
from
paris
for
two
weeks
phil
quentin
did
not
allow
dorothy
to
forget
the
old
association
and
then
came
the
day
of
her
departure
for
paris
garrison
was
by
no
means
reluctant
to
leave
london
not
that
she
disliked
the
place
or
the
people
but
that
one
philip
quentin
had
unceremoniously
even
gracefully
stepped
into
the
circle
of
her
contentment
rudely
obliterating
its
symmetrical
lines
quentin
had
much
to
overcome
if
he
contemplated
an
assault
upon
the
icy
reserve
with
which
dorothy
garrison
mother
regarded
his
genial
advances
she
recalled
the
days
when
her
daughter
and
he
were
silly
lovesick
children
and
there
was
not
much
comfort
to
be
derived
from
the
knowledge
that
he
had
grown
older
and
more
attractive
and
that
he
lost
no
opportunity
to
see
the
girl
who
once
held
his
heart
in
leash
the
mother
was
too
diplomatic
to
express
open
displeasure
or
to
offer
the
faintest
objection
to
this
renewal
of
friendship
if
it
were
known
that
she
opposed
the
visits
of
the
handsome
american
all
london
would
wonder
speculate
and
finally
understand
her
disapproval
could
only
be
construed
as
an
acknowledgment
that
she
feared
the
consequences
of
association
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
story
would
be
afloat
that
all
was
not
smooth
in
the
love
affairs
of
a
certain
prince
and
that
the
fires
of
an
old
affection
were
burning
brightly
and
merrily
in
the
face
of
a
wrathful
parent
opposition
in
secret
dorothy
herself
was
troubled
more
than
she
cared
to
admit
by
the
reappearance
of
one
who
could
not
but
awaken
memories
of
other
days
fondly
foolish
though
they
were
he
was
still
the
same
old
phil
grown
older
and
handsomer
and
he
brought
with
him
embarrassing
recollections
he
was
nothing
more
to
her
now
than
an
friend
and
she
was
nothing
to
him
she
loved
ugo
ravorelli
and
until
he
appeared
suddenly
before
her
in
london
philip
quentin
was
dead
to
her
thoughts
and
yet
she
felt
as
if
she
were
playing
with
a
fire
that
would
leave
its
scar
not
on
her
heart
or
quentin
perhaps
but
on
that
of
the
man
she
was
to
marry
it
required
no
great
strength
of
vision
to
see
that
ravorelli
was
jealous
and
it
was
just
as
plain
that
quentin
saw
and
enjoyed
the
uneasiness
he
was
causing
she
could
not
know
of
course
that
the
american
had
deliberately
planned
to
play
havoc
with
the
peace
and
comfort
of
her
lover
for
she
recognized
no
motive
how
could
she
know
that
giovanni
pavesi
the
tenor
and
prince
ravorelli
were
one
and
the
same
to
philip
quentin
how
could
she
know
that
the
beautiful
malban
was
slain
in
rio
janeiro
and
that
philip
quentin
had
seen
a
handsome
youth
led
to
and
from
the
dock
in
that
brazilian
city
how
then
could
she
understand
the
conflict
that
waged
with
herself
as
the
battlefield
as
for
quentin
he
was
bound
by
no
law
or
duty
to
respect
the
position
of
prince
ravorelli
he
was
convinced
that
the
sometime
romeo
had
the
stain
of
blood
on
his
delicate
hands
and
that
in
his
heart
he
concealed
the
secret
of
carmenita
malban
death
in
his
mind
there
was
no
mistake
quentin
composure
was
shaken
but
once
in
the
fortnight
of
pleasure
preceding
dorothy
departure
for
paris
that
was
when
she
indignantly
almost
tearfully
called
his
attention
to
the
squib
in
a
london
society
journal
which
rather
daringly
prophesied
a
break
in
the
match
and
referred
plainly
to
the
renewal
of
an
when
he
wrathfully
promised
to
thrash
the
editor
of
the
paper
she
shocked
him
by
saying
that
he
had
created
enough
of
a
sensation
and
he
went
home
with
the
dazed
feeling
of
one
who
has
suffered
an
unexpected
blow
on
the
evening
before
the
garrisons
crossed
the
channel
lord
and
lady
saxondale
and
philip
quentin
found
themselves
long
after
midnight
in
talk
about
the
coming
marriage
quentin
was
rather
silent
his
thoughts
seemed
far
from
the
room
in
which
he
sat
and
there
was
the
shadow
of
a
new
line
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
i
am
going
to
brussels
next
week
he
said
deliberately
the
others
stared
at
him
in
amazement
to
brussels
you
mean
new
york
said
lady
frances
faintly
new
york
wo
see
me
for
some
time
i
going
to
make
a
tour
of
the
continent
this
is
going
too
far
old
man
cried
lord
bob
you
ca
gain
anything
by
following
her
and
you
only
raise
the
devil
of
a
row
all
round
dash
it
stay
in
thanks
for
the
invitation
bob
but
i
always
had
a
desire
to
learn
something
about
the
miniature
paris
i
shall
spend
some
time
in
paris
and
then
go
up
there
to
compare
the
places
besides
there
wo
be
any
but
there
will
be
phil
cried
lady
saxondale
you
must
keep
out
of
this
affair
why
all
europe
knows
of
the
wedding
and
even
now
the
continent
is
quietly
nursing
the
gossip
of
the
past
two
she
dropped
into
a
chair
perplexed
and
anxious
let
me
tell
you
something
both
of
you
the
events
of
the
past
two
weeks
are
tame
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
next
two
months
said
quentin
a
new
light
in
his
eye
his
tall
figure
straightened
and
his
nostrils
expanded
wha
what
do
you
mean
floundered
lord
bob
just
this
i
love
dorothy
garrison
and
i
going
to
marry
good
heavens
was
the
simultaneous
gasp
of
lord
and
lady
saxondale
and
they
could
not
dissuade
him
not
only
did
he
convince
them
that
he
was
in
earnest
but
before
he
left
for
paris
he
had
made
them
allies
ugo
experience
in
rio
janeiro
shocked
lady
frances
so
seriously
that
she
became
a
champion
of
the
cause
and
agreed
with
lord
bob
that
dorothy
should
not
be
sacrificed
if
it
were
in
their
power
to
prevent
of
course
dickey
savage
approved
of
quentin
campaign
and
effectually
disposed
of
lady
jane
faint
objections
by
saying
america
for
the
americans
brussels
for
the
americans
england
for
the
americans
everything
and
everybody
for
the
americans
but
nothing
at
all
for
these
confounded
foreigners
let
the
italian
marry
anybody
he
pleases
just
so
long
as
he
does
interfere
with
an
american
let
the
american
marry
anybody
he
pleases
and
to
perdition
with
all
interference
i
for
america
against
the
world
in
love
or
in
do
forget
savage
that
you
are
a
foreigner
when
on
british
soil
remonstrated
the
lady
jane
vigorously
my
dear
lady
jane
an
american
is
at
home
anywhere
in
this
world
if
you
could
see
some
of
the
foreigners
that
land
at
castle
garden
you
would
blame
an
american
for
absolutely
irrevocably
and
eternally
refusing
to
be
called
a
foreigner
even
on
the
shores
of
madagascar
we
are
willing
to
be
most
anything
but
i
be
hanged
if
we
be
a
week
later
quentin
was
in
paris
savage
was
to
join
him
in
brussels
about
the
middle
of
august
and
lord
and
lady
saxondale
promised
faithfully
to
come
to
that
city
at
a
moment
notice
he
went
blithely
away
with
the
firm
conviction
in
his
heart
that
it
was
not
to
be
a
fool
errand
but
he
was
reckoning
without
the
woman
in
the
case
if
you
do
marry
her
quentin
i
got
just
the
place
for
you
to
live
in
for
a
while
at
least
i
bought
an
old
castle
in
luxemburg
a
couple
of
years
ago
just
because
the
man
who
owned
it
was
a
friend
and
needed
a
few
thousand
pounds
frances
calls
it
castle
craneycrow
it
a
romantic
place
and
would
be
a
great
deal
better
than
a
cottage
for
love
you
may
have
it
whenever
the
time
comes
nobody
lives
there
now
but
the
caretaker
and
a
lot
of
deuced
traditions
we
can
discharge
the
caretaker
and
you
can
make
fresh
traditions
think
it
over
my
boy
while
you
are
dispatching
the
prince
the
mamma
and
the
fair
victim
ambition
to
become
a
real
live
do
be
sarcastic
bob
exclaimed
quentin
i
not
need
your
castle
we
going
to
live
in
the
beware
of
the
prince
said
lady
frances
he
is
pretty
high
himself
you
let
the
prince
beware
laughed
back
the
departing
guest
we
both
live
in
the
same
cloud
you
know
i
push
him
on
the
day
quentin
left
paris
for
brussels
he
came
face
to
face
with
prince
ugo
on
one
of
the
parisian
boulevards
the
handsome
italian
was
driving
with
count
sallaconi
and
two
very
attractive
ladies
that
the
meeting
was
unexpected
and
undesired
was
made
manifest
by
the
anxious
look
which
the
prince
shot
over
his
shoulder
after
the
carriage
had
passed
when
quentin
left
paris
that
night
with
turk
and
his
luggage
he
was
not
the
only
passenger
bound
for
brussels
at
the
gare
du
nord
two
men
one
suspiciously
like
the
duke
laselli
took
a
compartment
in
the
coach
just
ahead
of
quentin
the
train
was
due
to
reach
brussels
shortly
after
midnight
and
the
american
had
telegraphed
for
apartments
at
the
bellevue
there
had
been
a
drizzle
of
rain
all
the
evening
and
it
was
good
to
be
inside
the
car
even
if
the
seats
were
uncomfortable
turk
and
his
master
were
the
only
passengers
in
the
compartment
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
former
had
seen
several
persons
men
and
women
pass
through
the
aisle
into
which
the
section
opened
one
woman
paused
at
the
entrance
as
if
about
to
enter
she
was
fair
to
look
upon
and
turk
gallantly
moved
presenting
a
roomy
end
of
his
seat
to
her
she
passed
on
however
and
the
little
glanced
sharply
at
his
master
as
if
to
accuse
him
of
frightening
the
fair
one
away
but
quentin
was
lying
back
and
there
was
nothing
repellent
about
the
untroubled
expression
on
his
face
before
reaching
le
cateau
the
same
lady
passed
the
entrance
and
again
glanced
inside
turk
was
now
asleep
but
his
master
was
staring
dreamily
toward
the
aperture
leading
to
the
aisle
he
saw
the
woman
face
for
an
instant
and
it
gradually
dawned
upon
him
that
there
was
something
familiar
about
its
beauty
where
had
he
seen
her
before
like
the
curious
american
he
was
he
arose
a
few
minutes
later
and
deliberately
walked
into
the
aisle
he
passed
two
compartments
before
he
saw
the
young
woman
she
was
alone
and
was
leaning
back
her
eyes
closed
quentin
observed
that
she
was
young
and
beautiful
and
possessed
the
marks
of
fashion
and
refinement
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
upon
the
face
of
the
dozing
french
woman
more
certain
than
ever
that
he
had
seen
her
recently
she
opened
her
eyes
with
an
affrighted
start
he
instantly
and
in
some
embarrassment
turned
to
escape
the
eyes
which
had
caught
him
in
a
rare
bit
of
impertinence
but
was
surprised
to
hear
her
call
softly
monsieur
mademoiselle
he
replied
pausing
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
i
must
speak
with
you
quentin
come
inside
i
shall
detain
you
but
a
moment
and
it
is
so
very
important
that
you
should
hear
she
was
now
sitting
upright
visibly
excited
and
confused
but
very
much
in
earnest
you
know
my
name
he
said
entering
and
dropping
to
the
seat
beside
her
where
have
we
met
your
face
is
familiar
but
i
am
ashamed
to
admit
we
have
no
time
to
talk
of
that
you
have
never
met
me
and
would
not
know
who
i
am
if
i
told
you
had
it
not
been
for
that
horrid
little
man
of
yours
i
should
have
boldly
addressed
you
sooner
i
must
leave
the
train
at
le
cateau
for
i
can
not
go
on
to
quevy
or
mons
it
would
not
be
wise
for
me
to
leave
france
at
this
time
you
do
not
know
me
but
i
wish
to
befriend
befriend
me
i
am
sure
one
could
not
ask
for
a
more
charming
friend
said
he
smiling
gallantly
but
now
evincing
a
shade
of
interest
no
flattery
monsieur
it
is
purely
a
personal
matter
with
me
this
is
by
no
means
a
pleasure
trip
i
am
running
a
great
risk
but
it
is
for
my
own
sake
as
much
as
for
yours
so
do
not
thank
me
i
came
from
paris
on
this
train
because
i
could
not
speak
to
you
at
the
gare
du
nord
you
were
watched
too
watched
what
do
you
mean
almost
gasped
quentin
i
can
only
say
that
you
are
in
danger
and
that
you
have
incurred
the
displeasure
of
a
man
who
brooks
no
he
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
his
mind
in
a
whirl
the
thought
that
she
might
be
mad
grew
but
was
instantly
succeeded
by
another
which
came
like
a
shock
is
this
man
of
noble
blood
yes
she
almost
whispered
turning
her
eyes
away
and
he
means
to
do
me
harm
i
am
sure
of
because
because
he
fears
your
in
what
direction
you
know
without
asking
and
why
do
you
take
this
interest
in
me
i
am
nothing
to
it
because
you
are
not
to
be
treated
fairly
listen
on
this
train
are
two
men
who
do
not
know
that
i
am
here
and
who
would
be
confounded
if
they
were
to
see
me
they
are
in
one
of
the
forward
coaches
and
they
are
emissaries
sent
on
to
watch
your
every
movement
and
to
report
the
progress
of
your
your
business
in
brussels
if
you
become
too
aggressive
before
the
man
who
employs
them
can
arrange
to
come
to
brussels
you
are
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
manner
effectual
what
is
to
be
done
with
you
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
certain
you
are
in
great
danger
unless
you
she
paused
and
a
queer
expression
came
into
her
wide
eyes
unless
what
you
interest
unless
you
withdraw
from
the
you
assume
that
there
is
a
contest
of
some
sort
well
admitting
there
is
one
i
say
that
you
may
go
back
to
the
prince
and
tell
him
his
scheme
does
work
this
story
of
yours
pardon
me
mademoiselle
is
a
clever
one
and
you
have
done
your
part
well
but
i
am
not
in
the
least
alarmed
kindly
return
to
the
man
who
sent
you
and
ask
him
to
come
in
your
stead
if
he
wants
to
frighten
me
i
am
not
afraid
of
women
you
you
wrong
me
monsieur
i
am
not
his
agent
i
am
acting
purely
on
my
own
responsibility
for
myself
alone
i
have
a
personal
object
in
warning
you
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
let
me
add
that
i
wish
you
success
in
the
undertaking
which
now
interests
you
you
must
believe
me
though
when
i
say
that
you
are
in
danger
forewarned
is
forearmed
i
do
not
know
what
steps
are
to
be
taken
against
you
time
will
expose
them
but
i
do
know
that
you
are
not
to
win
what
you
this
is
a
very
strange
proceeding
began
he
of
her
sincerity
we
are
nearing
le
cateau
and
i
must
leave
you
the
men
of
whom
i
speak
are
the
duke
laselli
and
a
detective
called
courant
i
know
they
are
sent
to
watch
you
and
they
mean
you
no
good
be
careful
for
god
sake
monsieur
for
i
i
want
you
to
win
she
was
standing
now
and
with
trembling
fingers
was
adjusting
a
thick
veil
over
her
face
why
are
you
so
interested
in
me
he
asked
sharply
why
do
you
want
me
to
win
to
win
well
to
win
the
battle
because
she
began
but
checked
herself
a
deep
blush
spread
over
her
face
just
as
she
dropped
the
veil
the
cad
he
said
understanding
coming
to
him
like
a
flash
there
is
more
than
one
heart
at
and
good
luck
monsieur
she
whispered
he
held
her
hand
for
an
instant
as
she
passed
him
then
she
was
gone
mile
after
mile
from
le
cateau
to
quevy
found
him
puzzling
over
the
odd
experience
of
the
night
suddenly
he
started
and
muttered
half
aloud
by
thunder
i
remember
now
it
was
she
who
sat
beside
him
in
the
carriage
this
morning
viii
the
fate
of
a
letter
at
quevy
the
customs
officers
went
through
the
train
and
quentin
knew
that
he
was
in
belgium
for
some
time
he
had
been
weighing
in
his
mind
the
advisability
of
searching
the
train
for
a
glimpse
of
the
duke
and
his
companion
doubtful
as
to
the
sincerity
of
the
beautiful
and
mysterious
stranger
it
was
not
until
the
train
reached
mons
that
he
caught
sight
of
the
duke
he
had
started
out
deliberately
at
last
to
hunt
for
the
italian
and
the
latter
evidently
had
a
similar
design
they
met
on
the
platform
and
though
it
was
quite
dark
each
recognized
the
other
the
american
was
on
the
point
of
addressing
the
duke
when
that
gentleman
abruptly
turned
and
reentered
the
train
one
coach
ahead
of
that
occupied
by
quentin
who
returned
to
his
compartment
and
proceeded
to
awaken
the
snoring
without
reserve
he
confided
to
turk
the
whole
story
of
the
night
up
to
that
point
i
do
know
what
their
game
is
turk
but
we
must
not
be
caught
napping
we
have
a
friend
in
the
pretty
woman
who
got
off
in
the
rain
at
le
cateau
she
loves
the
prince
and
that
why
she
with
say
did
she
look
if
she

royal
blood

her
mebby

young
man
do
let
me
hear
of
you
making
a
move
in
this
affair
till
i
say
the
word
you
are
to
keep
your
mouth
closed
and
your
hands
behind
you
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
watch
just
as
they
are
doing
your
early
training
ought
to
stand
you
well
in
hand
for
this
game
i
believe
you
once
said
you
had
eyes
in
the
back
of
your
eyes
nothin
they
is
microscopes
quentin
during
the
remainder
of
the
run
to
brussels
turned
the
new
situation
over
and
over
in
his
mind
that
the
prince
was
ready
to
acknowledge
him
as
a
dangerous
rival
gave
him
much
satisfaction
and
inspired
the
hope
that
miss
garrison
had
given
her
lover
some
cause
for
alarm
the
decisive
movement
on
the
part
of
prince
ugo
to
forestall
any
advantage
he
might
acquire
while
near
her
in
brussels
was
a
surprise
and
something
of
a
shock
to
him
it
was
an
admission
despite
his
position
and
the
pledge
he
had
from
the
girl
herself
that
the
italian
did
not
feel
secure
in
the
premises
and
was
willing
to
resort
to
trickery
if
not
villainy
to
circumvent
the
american
who
knew
him
in
other
days
phil
felt
positive
that
the
move
against
him
was
the
result
of
deliberate
intent
else
how
should
his
fair
friend
of
the
early
evening
know
that
a
plot
was
brewing
unquestionably
she
had
heard
or
learned
of
the
directions
to
the
duke
her
own
interest
in
the
prince
was
of
course
the
inspiration
to
no
one
but
herself
could
she
entrust
the
delivery
of
the
warning
her
agitated
wish
openly
expressed
that
quentin
might
win
the
contest
had
a
much
deeper
meaning
than
would
appear
on
the
surface
from
the
moment
he
received
the
warning
the
affair
began
to
take
on
a
new
aspect
aside
from
the
primal
fact
that
he
was
desperately
in
love
with
dorothy
garrison
there
was
now
the
fresh
incentive
that
he
must
needs
win
her
against
uncertain
odds
and
in
the
face
of
surprising
opposition
in
this
day
and
age
of
the
world
in
affairs
of
the
heart
an
american
does
not
look
for
rivalry
that
bears
the
suggestion
of
medieval
romance
the
situation
savored
too
much
of
the
that
are
born
of
the
days
when
knights
held
sway
to
appear
natural
in
the
eyes
of
an
unromantic
gentleman
from
new
york
that
city
where
love
affairs
adjust
themselves
without
the
aid
of
a
novelist
quentin
of
course
was
loath
to
believe
that
prince
ugo
would
resort
to
underhand
means
to
checkmate
a
rival
whose
real
purpose
had
not
yet
been
announced
in
six
weeks
the
finest
wedding
in
years
was
to
occur
in
brussels
gudule
that
historic
cathedral
was
to
be
the
scene
of
a
ceremony
on
which
all
european
newspapers
had
the
eye
of
comment
american
papers
had
printed
columns
concerning
the
engagement
of
the
beautiful
miss
garrison
everywhere
had
been
published
the
romantic
story
of
this
real
love
match
what
then
should
the
prince
fear
the
train
rumbled
into
the
station
at
brussels
near
midnight
and
turk
sallied
forth
for
a
cab
this
he
obtained
without
the
usual
amount
of
haggling
on
his
part
due
to
the
disappointing
fact
that
the
belgian
driver
could
understand
nothing
more
than
the
word
bellevue
while
turk
could
interpret
nothing
more
than
the
word
franc
as
quentin
was
crossing
to
the
cab
he
encountered
duke
laselli
both
started
and
after
a
moment
pause
greeted
each
other
i
thought
i
saw
you
at
mons
said
phil
after
the
first
expressions
of
surprise
yes
i
boarded
the
train
there
some
business
called
me
to
mons
last
week
and
you
i
presume
like
most
tourists
are
visiting
a
dozen
cities
in
half
as
many
days
said
the
duke
in
his
execrable
english
they
paused
at
the
side
of
the
italian
conveyance
and
quentin
mentally
resolved
that
the
dim
light
as
it
played
upon
the
face
of
the
speaker
was
showing
to
him
the
most
repellent
countenance
he
had
ever
looked
upon
oh
no
he
answered
quickly
i
shall
probably
remain
until
after
the
marriage
of
my
friend
miss
garrison
and
prince
ugo
are
you
to
be
here
long
i
can
not
say
answered
the
other
his
black
eyes
fastened
on
quentin
my
business
here
is
of
an
uncertain
diplomatic
i
infer
it
would
not
be
diplomatic
for
me
to
say
so
i
suspect
i
shall
see
you
again
doubtless
i
am
to
be
at
the
and
i
also
we
may
see
some
of
the
town
you
are
very
kind
said
quentin
bowing
deeply
do
you
travel
alone
the
duchess
is
ill
and
is
in
florence
i
am
so
lonely
without
it
beastly
luck
for
business
to
carry
one
away
from
a
sick
wife
by
the
way
how
is
my
dear
friend
prince
ugo
exceptionally
well
thank
you
he
will
be
pleased
to
know
you
are
here
for
he
is
coming
to
brussels
next
week
i
think
if
you
will
pardon
me
he
has
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
i
trust
after
longer
acquaintance
he
may
not
find
me
a
disappointment
said
phil
warmly
and
a
faint
look
of
curiosity
flashed
into
the
duke
eyes
as
they
were
saying
quentin
looked
about
for
the
man
who
might
be
courant
the
detective
but
the
duke
companion
was
not
to
be
seen
the
next
morning
quentin
proceeded
in
a
very
systematic
and
effective
way
to
locate
the
home
of
the
garrisons
he
was
aware
in
the
beginning
that
they
lived
in
a
huge
beautiful
mansion
somewhere
in
the
avenue
louise
he
knew
from
his
baedeker
that
the
upper
town
was
the
fashionable
quarter
and
that
the
avenue
louise
was
one
of
the
principal
streets
an
electric
tramcar
took
him
speedily
through
the
boulevards
regent
and
waterloo
to
the
avenue
louise
a
strange
diffidence
had
prevented
him
from
asking
at
the
hotel
for
directions
that
would
easily
have
discovered
her
home
somehow
he
wanted
to
stroll
along
the
avenue
in
the
early
morning
and
locate
the
home
of
dorothy
garrison
without
other
aid
than
the
power
which
tells
one
when
he
is
near
the
object
of
his
adoration
he
left
the
car
at
the
head
of
the
avenue
and
walked
slowly
along
the
street
his
mind
was
full
of
her
every
vehicle
that
passed
attracted
his
gaze
for
he
speculated
that
she
might
be
in
one
of
them
not
a
woman
came
within
the
range
of
his
vision
but
she
was
subjected
to
a
hurried
inspection
even
from
a
distance
he
strode
slowly
along
looking
intently
at
each
house
none
of
them
seemed
to
him
to
hold
the
object
of
his
search
as
his
steps
carried
him
farther
and
farther
into
the
beautiful
avenue
he
began
to
smile
to
himself
and
his
plodding
spirit
wavered
after
all
thought
he
no
one
but
a
silly
ass
would
attempt
to
find
a
person
in
a
great
city
after
the
fashion
he
was
pursuing
he
was
deciding
to
board
a
tramcar
and
return
to
the
hotel
when
at
some
distance
ahead
he
saw
a
young
lady
run
hurriedly
down
the
steps
of
an
impressive
looking
house
he
recognized
dorothy
garrison
and
with
a
thump
of
exultation
his
heart
urged
him
across
the
street
toward
her
she
evidently
had
not
seen
him
her
eyes
were
on
the
ground
and
she
seemed
preoccupied
in
her
hand
she
held
a
letter
a
gasp
of
astonishment
almost
of
alarm
came
from
her
lips
her
eyes
opened
wide
in
that
sort
of
surprise
which
reveals
something
like
terror
and
then
she
crumpled
the
letter
in
her
hand
spasmodically
i
thought
you
lived
down
here
somewhere
he
exclaimed
joyfully
seizing
her
hand
knew
i
could
find
i
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
she
stammered
with
a
brave
effort
to
recover
from
the
shock
his
appearance
had
created
what
are
you
doing
here
phil
looking
for
you
dorothy
shall
i
post
your
letter
she
was
still
standing
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
the
letter
in
a
sad
plight
oh
i
not
not
post
it
now
i
should
have
sent
the
footman
come
with
me
and
see
mamma
i
know
she
will
be
glad
to
have
you
here
she
hurried
in
evident
confusion
she
bethought
herself
suddenly
and
made
an
effort
to
withdraw
the
letter
from
its
rather
conspicuous
position
the
hand
containing
it
was
drawn
behind
her
back
that
will
be
very
nice
of
her
better
post
the
letter
though
somebody
expecting
it
you
know
hullo
that
not
a
nice
way
to
treat
a
letter
let
me
straighten
it
out
for
you
never
mind
phil
really
i
do
care
about
it
you
surprised
me
so
tremendously
that
i
fear
i
ruined
it
now
i
shall
have
to
write
fiddlesticks
send
it
as
it
is
the
prince
will
blame
the
postoffice
people
cried
he
it
is
not
for
the
prince
she
cried
quickly
and
then
became
more
confused
than
ever
come
to
the
house
phil
you
must
tell
me
how
you
happen
to
be
as
they
walked
slowly
to
the
garrison
home
and
mounted
the
steps
she
religiously
held
the
epistle
where
he
could
not
regard
it
too
closely
should
his
curiosity
overcome
his
prudence
they
were
ushered
into
the
reception
room
and
she
directed
the
footman
to
ask
if
garrison
could
see
quentin
now
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
taking
a
chair
quite
across
the
big
room
there
nothing
to
tell
he
said
i
am
in
brussels
and
i
thought
i
hunt
you
but
why
did
you
write
or
wire
me
that
you
were
coming
you
have
acted
much
like
a
friend
she
said
pointedly
perhaps
i
wrote
and
never
mailed
the
letter
remember
your
experience
just
now
you
still
hold
the
unlucky
note
in
your
hand
sometimes
we
think
better
of
our
intentions
at
the
very
instant
when
they
are
going
into
effect
it
is
very
mysterious
to
me
that
you
would
mail
that
letter
i
can
only
believe
that
you
changed
your
mind
when
you
saw
how
absurd
as
if
seeing
you
could
have
anything
to
do
with
it
you
ought
to
tell
me
if
my
appearance
here
is
liable
to
alter
any
plan
that
letter
is
intended
to
perfect
do
let
me
be
an
inconvenience
you
know
i
rather
be
anything
than
an
it
does
matter
in
the
least
really
it
does
your
coming
the
footman
appeared
on
the
landing
above
at
that
instant
and
said
something
to
her
in
a
language
quentin
could
not
understand
he
afterward
heard
it
was
french
and
he
always
had
thought
himself
a
pretty
fair
french
scholar
too
mamma
has
asked
for
me
phil
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
leave
you
alone
for
a
moment
she
said
arising
and
starting
toward
the
grand
stairway
the
letter
which
she
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
fell
from
her
lap
to
the
rug
in
an
instant
he
had
stepped
forward
to
pick
it
up
as
he
stooped
she
realized
what
had
happened
and
with
a
frantic
little
cry
stooped
also
their
heads
were
close
together
but
his
hand
was
the
first
to
touch
the
missive
it
lay
with
the
address
upward
plain
to
the
eye
he
could
not
help
seeing
the
name
it
was
addressed
to
philip
quentin
care
of
the
earl
of
saxondale
park
lane
london
surprise
stayed
his
fingers
and
hers
clutched
the
envelope
ruthlessly
as
they
straightened
themselves
each
was
looking
directly
into
the
other
eyes
in
hers
there
was
shame
confusion
even
guilt
in
his
triumphant
tantalizing
mirth
my
letter
please
he
said
his
voice
trembling
he
knew
not
why
his
hand
was
extended
she
drew
suddenly
away
and
a
wave
of
scarlet
crossed
her
face
what
a
stupid
i
was
to
drop
it
she
cried
almost
tearfully
then
she
laughed
as
the
true
humor
of
the
situation
made
itself
felt
in
spite
of
consequences
is
it
too
funny
for
anything
i
ca
see
anything
funny
in
tampering
with
the
mails
you
have
my
letter
and
i
hope
it
wo
be
necessary
for
me
to
call
in
the
officers
of
the
you
do
expect
me
to
give
it
to
you
she
cried
holding
it
behind
her
most
assuredly
if
you
do
i
ask
garrison
to
command
you
to
do
so
he
threatened
eagerly
he
would
have
given
his
head
to
read
the
contents
of
the
letter
that
caused
her
so
much
concern
all
sorts
of
conjectures
were
racing
through
his
brain
oh
please
do
do
that
she
begged
and
he
saw
real
supplication
in
her
eyes
i
would
give
you
the
letter
for
the
world
and
i
i
well
do
you
see
that
i
am
embarrassed
give
me
the
letter
he
commanded
sternly
do
you
wish
me
to
hate
you
she
blazed
forbid
then
forget
that
your
name
is
on
this
this
detestable
envelope
she
cried
tearing
the
missive
into
pieces
he
looked
on
in
wonder
chagrin
disappointment
by
george
dorothy
that
downright
cruel
it
was
intended
for
me
you
should
thank
me
i
have
only
saved
you
the
trouble
of
destroying
it
she
said
smiling
i
would
have
kept
it
forever
he
said
fervently
here
a
small
bit
of
the
envelope
which
you
may
keep
as
a
souvenir
see
it
has
your
name
on
it
you
shall
have
that
much
of
the
he
took
it
rather
gracelessly
and
deliberately
opening
his
watch
placed
it
inside
the
case
i
give
to
know
what
that
letter
had
to
say
to
you
can
never
know
she
said
defiantly
from
the
bottom
of
the
steps
for
i
have
forgotten
the
contents
she
laughed
as
she
ran
upstairs
but
he
detected
confusion
in
the
tone
and
the
faint
flush
was
still
on
her
cheek
he
sat
down
and
wondered
whether
the
contents
would
have
pleased
or
displeased
him
philosophically
he
resolved
that
as
long
as
he
was
never
to
know
he
might
just
as
well
look
at
it
from
a
cheerful
point
of
view
he
would
be
pleased
ix
mother
and
daughter
it
would
be
difficult
to
define
the
emotions
that
consumed
miss
garrison
as
she
entered
her
mother
boudoir
she
could
not
conceal
from
herself
the
sensation
of
jubilant
delight
because
he
had
come
to
brussels
at
the
same
time
even
though
his
visit
was
that
of
a
mere
friend
it
promised
complications
which
she
was
loath
to
face
she
went
into
the
presence
of
her
mother
with
the
presentiment
that
the
first
of
the
series
was
at
hand
what
is
philip
quentin
doing
here
dorothy
demanded
garrison
she
was
standing
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
her
attitude
was
that
of
one
who
has
experienced
a
very
unpleasant
surprise
the
calm
cold
tone
was
not
far
from
accusing
her
steely
eyes
were
hard
and
uncompromising
the
tall
daughter
stood
before
her
one
hand
still
clutching
the
bits
of
white
paper
on
her
face
there
was
the
imprint
of
demure
concern
i
have
had
time
to
ask
him
mamma
she
said
lightly
would
it
be
quite
the
proper
thing
to
demand
the
reason
for
his
presence
here
when
it
seems
quite
clear
that
he
is
paying
us
a
brief
morning
call
do
not
be
absurd
i
mean
what
is
he
doing
in
brussels
did
he
say
he
was
to
return
to
new
york
last
week
there
was
refined
belligerence
in
her
voice
dorothy
gave
a
brief
thought
to
the
cool
unabashed
young
man
below
and
smiled
inwardly
as
she
contemplated
the
reception
he
was
to
receive
from
this
austere
interrogator
do
ask
me
mamma
i
am
as
much
puzzled
as
you
over
his
sudden
advent
it
is
barely
possible
he
did
not
go
to
new
well
why
did
he
this
was
almost
a
threat
it
is
a
mystery
we
have
yet
to
unravel
shall
we
send
for
sherlock
holmes
dorothy
i
am
very
serious
how
can
you
make
light
of
this
unwarranted
intrusion
he
is
why
do
you
call
it
intrusion
mamma
has
he
not
the
right
to
come
can
we
close
the
door
in
his
face
is
he
not
a
friend
can
we
help
ourselves
if
he
knocks
at
our
door
and
asks
to
see
us
dorothy
felt
a
smart
tug
of
guilt
as
she
looked
back
and
saw
herself
trudging
sheepishly
up
the
front
steps
beside
the
intruder
who
had
not
been
permitted
to
knock
at
the
door
a
gentleman
would
not
subject
you
to
the
comments
of
of
well
i
may
say
the
whole
world
he
certainly
saw
the
paragraphs
in
those
london
papers
and
he
knows
that
we
can
not
permit
them
to
be
repeated
over
here
he
has
no
right
to
thrust
himself
upon
us
under
the
circumstances
you
must
give
him
to
understand
at
once
dorothy
that
his
intentions
or
visits
if
you
choose
to
call
them
such
are
obnoxious
to
both
of
oh
mamma
we
talked
all
this
over
before
what
can
i
do
i
would
offend
him
for
the
world
and
i
am
sure
he
is
incapable
of
any
desire
to
have
me
talked
about
he
knows
me
and
he
likes
me
too
well
for
that
perhaps
he
will
go
away
soon
said
dorothy
despairing
petulance
in
her
voice
secretly
she
was
conscious
of
the
justice
in
her
mother
complaints
he
shall
go
soon
said
garrison
with
determination
you
will
not
will
not
drive
him
away
said
her
daughter
quickly
i
shall
make
him
understand
that
you
are
not
the
foolish
child
he
knew
in
new
york
you
are
about
to
become
a
princess
he
shall
be
forced
to
see
the
impregnable
wall
between
himself
and
the
princess
ravorelli
for
you
are
virtually
the
owner
of
that
glorious
title
a
single
step
remains
and
then
you
are
no
longer
dorothy
garrison
philip
quentin
i
have
always
disliked
even
mistrusted
his
reputation
in
new
york
was
that
of
a
man
of
the
town
a
rich
roisterer
a
of
hearts
as
your
uncle
has
often
called
him
he
is
a
daring
notoriety
seeker
and
this
is
rare
sport
for
garrison
eyes
were
blazing
her
hands
were
clenched
her
bearing
that
of
one
who
is
both
judge
and
executioner
i
think
you
do
him
an
injustice
said
dorothy
slowly
a
feeling
of
deep
resentment
asserting
itself
philip
is
not
what
you
call
him
he
is
a
mother
and
daughter
looked
into
each
other
eyes
squarely
for
a
moment
neither
flinching
both
justifying
themselves
for
the
positions
they
were
to
take
you
defend
him
as
he
would
defend
you
have
another
man
to
defend
do
you
think
of
him
you
have
yet
to
say
that
ugo
is
no
gentleman
it
will
then
be
time
for
defense
such
as
i
am
offering
we
are
keeping
your
friend
waiting
dorothy
said
garrison
with
blasting
irony
give
him
my
compliments
and
say
that
we
trust
he
may
come
every
day
he
affords
us
a
subject
for
pleasant
discussion
and
i
am
sure
prince
ugo
will
be
as
charmed
to
meet
him
here
as
he
was
in
do
be
sarcastic
mamma
it
does
help
matters
and
began
dorothy
almost
plaintively
mr
quentin
certainly
does
not
help
matters
my
dear
still
if
you
will
enjoy
the
comment
the
notoriety
that
he
may
be
generous
enough
to
share
with
you
i
can
say
no
more
when
you
are
ready
to
dismiss
him
you
shall
find
me
your
she
was
triumphant
because
she
had
scored
with
sarcasm
a
point
where
reason
must
have
fallen
far
short
i
might
tell
rudolf
to
throw
him
into
the
street
said
dorothy
dolefully
only
i
am
quite
positive
phil
would
refuse
to
be
thrown
by
less
than
three
rudolfs
but
he
is
expecting
you
downstairs
mamma
he
asked
for
i
can
not
see
him
tell
him
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
see
him
if
he
calls
again
and
there
was
a
deep
unmistaken
meaning
in
the
way
she
said
it
you
will
not
go
down
dorothy
face
flushed
with
something
akin
to
humiliation
after
all
he
did
not
deserve
to
be
treated
like
a
dog
i
am
quite
content
upstairs
replied
garrison
sweetly
dorothy
turned
from
her
mother
without
another
word
and
as
she
went
down
the
stairs
there
was
rebellion
in
her
soul
the
fires
of
resistance
showed
their
first
tiny
tongues
in
the
hot
wave
that
swept
through
her
being
quentin
was
stretched
out
comfortably
in
a
big
chair
his
back
toward
the
stairs
his
eyes
upon
the
busy
avenue
below
she
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
there
was
a
strange
longing
to
pass
her
fingers
over
the
thick
dark
hair
the
thought
passed
instantaneously
but
there
was
a
new
shyness
in
her
manner
as
she
approached
hullo
he
said
arising
as
he
heard
her
footfall
been
watching
the
people
drive
by
pretty
smart
traps
some
of
them
too
the
old
families
that
came
over
in
the
ark
with
moses
er
noah
i
should
there
was
deep
concern
in
the
remark
but
she
was
confident
that
he
vaguely
understood
why
she
was
alone
mamma
trusts
you
will
excuse
her
this
morning
she
says
she
will
be
glad
to
see
you
when
you
come
she
seated
herself
on
a
divan
near
the
window
a
trifle
out
of
the
glaring
light
of
the
august
sun
she
held
in
her
hand
a
fan
and
the
bits
of
paper
had
disappeared
is
it
dreadfully
warm
looks
like
rain
too
said
he
briefly
then
with
new
animation
tell
me
what
was
in
that
letter
nothing
but
nonsense
she
replied
smiling
serenely
for
she
was
again
a
diplomat
how
dare
you
how
dare
you
write
nonsense
to
me
but
really
like
to
know
what
it
was
you
admit
i
have
a
right
to
be
it
pleases
me
to
see
you
curious
i
believe
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
interested
in
anything
quite
novel
i
assure
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
assuredly
well
i
think
it
a
roaring
shame
to
write
anything
to
a
fellow
that
he
ca
be
allowed
to
read
i
would
treat
you
that
i
know
you
would
you
are
too
good
and
too
sensible
and
too
considerate
and
all
the
other
kind
of
too
while
i
am
just
an
unaccountable
ninny
if
you
ever
did
anything
crazy
you
like
to
have
it
found
out
would
you
by
all
means
then
i
could
take
treatment
for
the
malady
lean
forward
dorothy
so
that
i
can
see
your
eyes
that
right
now
look
at
me
squarely
will
you
tell
me
what
was
in
that
letter
she
returned
his
gaze
steadily
almost
mockingly
that
all
i
want
to
know
i
can
always
tell
by
a
girl
eyes
whether
she
is
i
am
not
well
i
drop
the
matter
for
all
time
doubtless
you
were
right
when
you
said
it
was
nonsense
you
ought
to
know
changing
the
subject
i
think
i
like
brussels
if
i
stay
here
long
he
was
again
nonchalant
indifferent
under
her
mask
of
unconcern
she
felt
a
trifle
piqued
that
he
did
not
persist
in
his
endeavor
to
learn
the
contents
of
the
unfortunate
letter
how
long
do
you
expect
i
mean
purpose
to
stay
she
asked
it
depends
on
conditions
i
may
be
crazy
enough
to
stay
six
weeks
and
i
may
be
crazy
enough
to
go
away
next
week
you
see
i
not
committing
myself
to
any
specified
degree
of
insanity
it
wo
make
so
much
difference
when
i
am
found
out
as
you
say
at
present
however
i
contemplate
staying
until
that
affair
at
she
could
not
hide
the
annoyance
the
discomfiture
his
assertion
inspired
in
a
second
she
saw
endless
unpleasantries
some
pleasantries
it
is
fair
to
say
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
gentle
way
of
escape
at
the
same
time
there
came
once
more
the
queer
flutter
she
had
felt
when
she
met
him
in
the
street
a
before
you
will
find
it
rather
dull
here
i
am
afraid
she
found
courage
to
say
or
do
you
know
many
people
the
american
minister
perhaps
do
know
a
soul
here
but
you
and
garrison
it
wo
be
dull
not
in
the
least
we
ride
and
drive
go
ballooning
or
anything
you
like
but
i
ca
phil
do
you
forget
that
i
am
to
be
married
in
six
weeks
she
cried
now
frightened
into
an
earnest
appeal
that
it
precisely
after
that
you
ca
go
ballooning
with
anybody
but
the
prince
so
for
at
least
a
month
you
can
have
a
good
time
telling
me
what
a
jolly
good
fellow
he
is
that
what
girls
like
you
know
and
i
do
mind
in
the
least
if
you
want
to
talk
about
him
by
the
hour
i
wo
utter
an
objection
of
course
i
suppose
you
be
pretty
busy
with
your
trousseau
and
so
forth
and
you
have
the
house
full
of
visitors
too
no
doubt
but
you
can
give
me
a
little
i
am
sure
mamma
would
not
she
never
did
approve
if
that
what
you
were
about
to
say
what
is
she
afraid
of
does
she
imagine
that
i
want
to
marry
you
good
heavens
so
devout
was
his
implied
denial
of
such
a
project
that
she
felt
herself
grow
hot
does
she
think
the
prince
has
you
safely
won
you
are
old
enough
to
take
care
of
yourself
i
she
knows
that
i
love
prince
ugo
and
that
he
is
the
only
man
i
shall
ever
love
her
disapproval
would
arise
from
the
needless
exposure
to
comment
you
remember
what
the
london
paper
said
about
if
she
thought
that
he
was
chilled
by
her
bold
opening
assertion
she
was
to
find
herself
mistaken
he
smiled
complacently
i
thought
it
was
very
nice
of
them
i
am
preserving
the
clipping
he
said
airily
we
can
talk
over
this
little
difficulty
with
public
opinion
when
we
had
more
time
to
think
about
it
you
see
i
been
here
but
ten
hours
and
i
may
be
willing
to
leave
tomorrow
that
is
after
i
seen
more
of
the
town
i
may
not
like
the
king
and
i
quite
sure
the
palace
does
suit
me
i
come
around
and
we
drive
through
one
of
these
famous
parks
oh
no
phil
really
you
do
know
how
it
embarrasses
me
i
go
away
if
you
say
you
do
want
to
see
me
at
all
dorothy
he
said
seriously
rising
and
standing
before
her
i
do
mean
that
you
know
i
want
to
see
you
for
old
times
i
shall
go
nevertheless
if
you
merely
hint
that
i
am
she
arose
and
suddenly
gave
him
her
hand
you
are
not
unwelcome
and
you
are
foolish
to
speak
in
that
manner
she
said
seriously
and
your
mother
she
must
endure
what
i
somewhere
baedeker
says
that
the
bois
de
la
cambre
is
the
finest
park
in
brussels
said
he
his
eyes
gleaming
i
am
quite
sure
baedeker
is
reliable
she
agreed
with
a
smile
at
three
afternoon
then
i
will
come
for
you
will
you
remember
me
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
i
am
sorry
not
to
see
her
she
followed
him
to
the
door
and
when
he
sped
lightly
down
the
steps
there
was
a
broad
smile
on
the
face
of
each
he
turned
and
both
laughed
outright
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
she
mused
as
she
went
to
her
room
upstairs
an
hour
later
her
daily
letter
to
the
prince
was
ready
for
the
post
the
only
allusion
to
the
visitor
of
the
morning
was
mr
quentin
our
new
york
friend
you
will
remember
made
us
a
brief
call
this
morning
he
is
quite
undecided
as
to
the
length
of
his
stay
here
but
i
hope
you
will
be
here
to
see
then
dismissing
quentin
from
her
mind
she
sat
down
to
dream
of
the
one
great
event
in
her
life
this
wonderful
glorious
wedding
in
old
gudule
already
her
trousseau
was
on
a
fair
way
to
completion
she
gave
no
thought
to
the
fortune
that
these
gowns
were
to
cost
she
considered
not
the
glories
she
was
to
reap
by
becoming
a
real
princess
she
dwelt
not
on
the
future
before
her
for
she
knew
she
was
to
be
happy
with
ugo
instead
she
dreamed
only
of
the
color
scheme
that
was
to
make
memorable
her
wedding
procession
in
her
mind
eye
she
saw
the
great
church
thronged
with
the
most
brilliant
illustrious
assemblage
it
had
ever
held
she
was
quite
sure
no
previous
gathering
could
have
been
more
august
and
a
smile
of
pride
came
to
her
lips
the
great
chorus
the
procession
the
lights
the
incomprehensible
combination
of
colors
the
chancel
the
flowers
her
wedding
gown
and
ugo
dark
glowing
face
rushed
in
and
out
of
her
vision
as
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
almost
forgot
to
breathe
the
thought
of
ugo
grew
and
grew
she
closed
her
eyes
and
saw
him
at
her
side
as
they
walked
proudly
from
the
altar
with
the
good
bishop
blessing
and
the
song
of
the
choir
in
their
ears
the
swelling
of
love
in
their
souls
so
vivid
became
the
dream
of
his
presence
that
she
could
almost
feel
his
hand
touching
hers
she
felt
her
eyes
turn
toward
him
with
all
that
great
crowd
watching
and
her
heart
quivered
with
passion
as
his
dark
happy
eyes
burnt
through
to
her
very
soul
somehow
she
heard
distinctly
the
whisper
my
wife
suddenly
a
strange
chill
came
over
this
idle
happy
dream
and
she
opened
her
eyes
with
a
start
ugo
face
fading
away
like
a
flash
the
thought
had
rushed
in
like
a
stab
from
a
dagger
would
philip
quentin
be
there
and
would
he
care
would
he
care
x
two
in
a
trap
th
juke
sent
his
card
up
sir
said
turk
his
master
was
once
more
in
his
rooms
at
the
bellevue
turk
was
looking
eminently
respectable
in
a
new
suit
of
blue
serge
when
asked
phil
glancing
at
laselli
card
he
had
forgotten
the
italian
and
the
sight
of
his
name
recalled
the
plot
unpleasantly
eleven
i
watched
him
leave
th
hotel
an
go
down
that
street
over
there
th
same
one
you
took
a
little
watching
me
i
suspect
have
seen
that
detective
fellow
have
you
turk
you
ought
to
be
able
to
scent
a
detective
three
miles
i
ca
scent
in
this
language
early
in
the
evening
as
quentin
was
leaving
the
hotel
for
a
short
stroll
he
met
the
duke
the
italian
accosted
him
familiarly
and
asked
if
he
were
trying
to
find
a
cool
spot
i
thought
a
ride
on
the
tramcars
might
cool
me
off
a
bit
said
phil
i
know
the
city
quite
well
and
i
too
am
searching
for
relief
from
the
heat
do
you
object
to
company
in
your
ride
or
stroll
happy
to
have
you
i
assure
you
if
you
be
good
enough
to
wait
here
for
a
moment
till
i
find
my
stick
i
be
with
the
duke
bowed
politely
and
phil
hastened
back
to
his
rooms
he
secured
his
stick
and
did
more
like
a
wise
young
man
he
bethought
himself
of
a
possible
trap
and
the
quest
of
the
stick
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
instruct
turk
to
follow
him
and
the
duke
and
to
be
where
he
was
needed
in
case
of
an
emergency
the
tall
american
in
his
flannels
and
the
short
bearded
italian
in
his
trim
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
strolled
leisurely
forth
into
the
crowded
place
du
palais
shall
we
walk
awhile
and
then
find
a
cafe
where
we
may
have
something
to
drink
asked
the
duke
his
english
so
imperfect
that
no
writer
could
reproduce
it
i
am
in
your
hands
and
at
your
mercy
said
the
other
clinging
close
to
him
as
they
merged
into
the
crowd
may
i
ask
if
you
have
many
friends
in
brussels
under
the
politeness
of
the
inquiry
quentin
with
amusement
saw
the
real
interest
looking
calmly
into
the
italian
beady
eyes
he
said
i
know
but
four
persons
here
and
you
are
included
in
the
list
my
servant
is
another
and
miss
garrison
are
old
and
particular
friends
you
know
in
fact
my
dear
duke
i
do
believe
i
should
have
come
to
brussels
at
all
were
they
not
they
are
most
charming
and
agreeable
murmured
the
duke
this
is
such
a
frightful
crowd
shall
we
not
cross
to
the
other
side
what
the
use
i
used
to
play
football
you
do
know
what
that
is
i
suppose
and
i
show
you
how
to
get
through
a
mob
get
in
front
that
right
and
i
bring
up
in
the
laughing
to
himself
he
brought
his
big
frame
up
against
the
little
man
back
and
surged
forward
sure
enough
they
went
through
the
mob
but
the
duke
was
the
volley
end
of
the
battering
ram
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
made
such
hurried
and
seemingly
unnecessary
progress
through
a
blockading
crowd
of
roisterers
when
they
finally
went
lunging
into
the
rue
de
la
madeleine
his
silk
hat
was
awry
his
composure
was
ruffled
and
he
was
very
much
out
of
breath
phil
supremely
at
ease
heaved
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
drawing
from
the
italian
a
glance
much
easier
than
i
thought
said
quentin
puffing
quietly
at
his
cigar
we
did
it
very
nicely
agreed
the
other
with
a
brave
effort
to
equal
the
american
unconcern
nevertheless
he
said
to
himself
many
times
before
they
reached
the
broad
boulevard
anspach
that
never
had
he
taken
such
a
stroll
and
never
had
he
known
how
little
difference
there
was
between
a
steam
and
a
human
propeller
he
almost
forgot
as
they
sat
at
a
small
table
in
front
of
a
cafe
to
institute
his
diplomatic
search
for
the
real
object
of
the
american
presence
in
brussels
it
was
twelve
when
they
returned
to
the
hotel
after
a
rather
picturesque
evening
in
the
gay
cafes
here
is
what
the
keen
little
italian
deduced
quentin
was
to
remain
in
brussels
until
he
took
a
notion
to
go
somewhere
else
quentin
had
seen
the
prince
driving
on
the
paris
boulevards
the
bois
de
la
cambre
offers
every
attraction
to
a
man
who
enjoys
driving
the
american
slept
with
a
revolver
near
his
pillow
and
his
manservant
had
killed
six
or
seven
men
in
the
united
states
because
of
his
marvellous
skill
with
the
pistol
quentin
was
a
most
unsophisticated
young
man
with
honesty
and
innocence
in
his
frank
eyes
although
they
sometimes
grew
rather
searching
he
could
only
be
overcome
by
cunning
he
was
in
love
with
miss
garrison
quentin
conclusions
laselli
was
a
liar
and
an
ass
prince
ugo
would
be
in
brussels
within
ten
days
he
was
careless
with
the
hearts
of
women
and
cruel
with
their
love
french
detectives
are
the
best
in
the
world
the
most
infallible
miss
garrison
loved
the
very
ground
the
prince
trod
upon
he
also
discovered
that
the
duke
could
drink
wine
as
a
fish
drinks
water
and
that
he
seldom
made
overtures
to
pay
for
it
until
his
companion
had
the
money
in
hand
ready
to
do
so
turk
was
waiting
for
him
when
he
reached
his
rooms
and
turk
was
not
amiable
a
very
attractive
innocent
and
demure
young
lady
who
could
not
speak
english
except
with
her
hands
and
eyes
had
relieved
him
of
a
stickpin
and
his
watch
while
he
sat
with
her
at
a
table
not
far
from
the
man
he
was
protecting
with
his
vaunted
eagle
an
she
swiped
right
under
me
nose
an
me
eyes
square
on
her
too
these
people
are
too
keen
for
me
they
ai
a
fairy
in
new
york
that
could
touched
me
without
d
dope
lem
me
tell
you
i
i
knowed
a
er
two
but
i
do
know
buttons
from
fishhooks
i
d
easiest
ever
went
to
sunday
it
was
with
a
flushed
rebellious
face
that
miss
garrison
stepped
into
the
victoria
the
next
afternoon
for
the
drive
to
the
bois
de
la
cambre
she
had
come
from
a
rather
trying
tilt
with
her
mother
and
as
they
drove
off
between
the
rows
of
trees
she
felt
that
a
pair
of
flaming
eyes
were
levelled
from
a
certain
upstairs
window
in
the
avenue
louise
the
biblical
admonition
to
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
had
not
been
entirely
disregarded
by
this
willful
young
lady
but
it
had
been
stretched
to
an
unusual
limit
for
the
occasion
she
felt
that
she
was
very
much
imposed
upon
by
circumstances
in
the
shape
of
an
unreasonable
mother
and
an
inconvenient
friend
quentin
more
in
love
than
ever
and
more
deeply
inspired
by
the
longing
to
win
where
reason
told
him
he
must
fail
did
not
flatter
himself
into
believing
that
garrison
wholly
approved
of
the
drive
instead
he
surmised
from
the
beginning
that
flushed
cheeks
were
not
from
happiness
but
from
excitement
and
that
he
was
not
altogether
a
shadowy
cause
with
rare
tact
he
plunged
at
once
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
of
uncertainty
and
began
to
struggle
upward
to
the
light
preferring
such
a
course
to
the
one
where
you
start
at
the
top
go
down
and
then
find
yourself
powerless
to
get
back
to
the
surface
was
your
mother
very
much
annoyed
when
you
said
you
were
coming
out
with
me
he
asked
she
started
and
a
queer
little
tinge
of
embarrassment
sprang
into
her
eyes
how
absurd
she
said
readily
however
is
the
avenue
beautiful
i
do
know
yet
he
said
without
looking
at
the
avenue
what
did
she
say
miss
garrison
did
not
reply
but
looked
straight
ahead
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
see
here
dorothy
i
not
a
child
and
i
not
a
lovesick
fool
just
curious
that
all
your
mother
has
no
cause
to
be
afraid
of
me
you
flatter
yourself
by
imagining
such
a
thing
as
because
there
is
any
more
danger
that
i
shall
fall
in
love
with
you
than
there
is
of
of
well
of
your
falling
in
love
with
me
and
you
know
how
improbable
i
do
see
any
occasion
to
refer
to
love
in
any
way
she
said
icily
mamma
certainly
does
not
expect
me
to
do
such
an
extraordinary
thing
if
you
will
talk
sensibly
phil
we
may
enjoy
the
drive
but
if
you
persist
in
talking
of
affairs
so
ridiculous
i
ca
say
that
i
expect
you
to
fall
in
love
with
me
so
for
once
your
mother
and
i
agree
nevertheless
she
did
want
you
to
come
with
me
he
said
absolutely
undisturbed
how
do
you
know
she
did
she
demanded
womanlike
then
before
she
was
quite
aware
of
it
they
were
in
a
deep
and
earnest
discussion
of
garrison
and
her
not
very
complimentary
views
and
how
do
you
feel
about
this
confounded
prospect
dorothy
you
are
not
afraid
of
what
a
few
gossips
noble
or
otherwise
may
say
about
a
friendship
that
is
entirely
the
business
of
two
people
and
not
the
property
of
the
general
public
if
you
feel
that
i
am
in
the
way
i
gladly
go
you
know
of
course
i
rather
hate
to
miss
seeing
you
once
in
a
while
but
i
think
i
have
the
courage
to
oh
it
not
nice
of
you
to
be
sarcastic
she
cried
wondering
however
whether
he
really
meant
gladly
when
he
said
it
somehow
she
felt
herself
admitting
that
she
was
piqued
by
his
apparent
readiness
to
abdicate
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
cocksure
of
his
ground
before
making
the
foregoing
and
other
observations
equally
as
indifferent
i
not
sarcastic
quite
the
reverse
i
very
serious
you
know
how
much
i
used
to
think
of
you
but
that
was
long
ago
and
you
were
such
a
foolish
boy
she
cried
interrupting
nervously
yes
i
know
a
boy
must
have
his
foolish
streaks
how
a
fellow
changes
as
he
gets
older
and
how
he
looks
back
and
laughs
at
the
fancies
he
had
when
a
boy
same
way
with
a
girl
though
i
he
said
it
so
calmly
so
naturally
that
she
took
a
sly
peep
at
his
face
it
revealed
nothing
but
blissful
imperturbability
i
glad
you
agree
with
me
you
see
i
always
thought
you
were
horribly
broken
up
when
i
when
i
found
that
i
also
was
indulging
in
a
foolish
streak
i
believe
i
came
to
my
senses
before
you
did
though
and
saw
how
ridiculous
it
all
was
children
do
such
queer
things
do
they
it
was
his
turn
to
take
a
sly
peep
and
his
spirits
went
down
a
bit
under
the
pressure
of
her
undisguised
frankness
how
lucky
it
was
we
found
it
out
before
we
ran
away
with
each
other
as
we
once
had
the
nerve
to
contemplate
gad
dorothy
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
what
a
mistake
it
would
have
been
she
was
bowing
to
some
people
in
a
brougham
and
the
question
was
never
answered
after
a
while
he
went
on
going
back
to
the
original
subject
i
shall
see
garrison
and
talk
it
over
with
her
explain
to
her
you
know
and
convince
her
that
i
do
in
the
least
care
what
the
gossips
say
about
me
i
believe
i
can
live
it
all
down
if
they
do
say
i
am
madly
hopelessly
in
love
with
the
very
charming
fiancee
of
an
italian
you
have
me
to
reckon
with
phil
i
am
the
one
to
consider
and
the
one
to
pass
judgment
you
may
be
able
to
appease
mamma
but
it
is
i
who
will
determine
whether
it
is
to
be
or
not
to
be
let
us
drop
the
subject
for
the
present
we
are
having
a
charming
drive
is
it
not
beautiful
to
his
amazement
and
to
hers
when
they
returned
late
in
the
afternoon
garrison
asked
him
to
come
back
and
dine
i
must
be
dreaming
he
said
to
himself
as
he
drove
away
as
shrewd
as
the
deuce
and
there
a
motive
in
her
sudden
friendliness
i
beginning
to
wonder
how
far
i
drop
and
how
hard
i
hit
when
this
affair
explodes
well
it
worth
a
mighty
strenuous
effort
if
i
win
i
the
luckiest
fool
on
earth
if
i
lose
the
surprise
wo
kill
at
eight
he
presented
himself
again
at
the
garrison
house
and
found
that
he
was
not
the
only
guest
he
was
introduced
to
a
number
of
people
three
of
whom
were
americans
the
others
french
these
were
hon
and
horace
knowlton
and
their
daughter
miss
knowlton
and
mme
de
cartier
mile
louise
gaudelet
and
count
raoul
de
vincent
dorothy
tells
me
you
are
to
be
in
brussels
for
several
weeks
and
i
was
sure
you
would
be
glad
to
know
some
of
the
people
here
they
can
keep
you
from
being
lonesome
and
they
will
not
permit
you
to
feel
that
you
are
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
said
garrison
quentin
bowed
deeply
to
her
flashed
a
glance
of
understanding
at
dorothy
and
then
surveyed
the
strangers
he
was
to
meet
quick
intelligence
revealed
her
motive
in
inviting
him
to
meet
these
people
and
out
of
sheer
respect
for
her
shrewdness
he
felt
like
applauding
she
was
cleverly
providing
him
with
acquaintances
that
any
man
might
wish
to
possess
and
she
was
doing
it
so
early
that
the
diplomacy
of
her
action
was
as
plain
as
day
to
at
least
two
people
mamma
is
clever
is
she
dorothy
said
to
him
merrily
as
they
entered
the
neither
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
had
been
chosen
to
take
her
out
it
was
in
the
game
she
is
very
kind
i
ca
say
how
glad
i
am
to
meet
these
people
my
stay
here
ca
possibly
be
dull
he
said
mile
gaudelet
is
stunning
is
she
do
you
really
think
so
she
asked
and
she
did
not
see
his
smile
the
dinner
was
a
rare
one
the
company
brilliant
but
there
was
to
occur
before
the
laughter
in
the
wine
had
spent
itself
an
incident
in
which
philip
quentin
figured
so
conspicuously
that
his
wit
as
a
dinner
guest
ceased
to
be
the
topic
of
subdued
side
talk
and
he
took
on
a
new
personality
xi
from
the
pots
and
plants
the
broad
veranda
which
faced
the
avenue
and
terminated
at
the
corner
of
the
house
in
a
huge
circle
not
unlike
an
open
conservatory
afforded
a
secluded
and
comparatively
cool
retreat
for
the
diners
later
in
the
evening
banked
along
the
rails
were
the
rarest
of
tropical
plants
shaded
incandescent
lamps
sent
their
glow
from
somewhere
among
the
palms
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
in
the
scene
if
quentin
had
a
purpose
in
being
particularly
assiduous
in
his
attentions
to
mlle
gaudelet
he
did
not
suspect
that
he
was
making
an
implacable
foe
of
henri
de
cartier
the
husband
of
another
very
charming
young
woman
unaccustomed
to
the
intrigues
of
paris
and
certainly
not
aware
that
brussels
copied
the
fashions
of
her
bigger
sister
across
the
border
in
more
ways
than
one
he
could
not
be
expected
to
know
that
de
cartier
loved
not
his
wife
and
did
love
the
pretty
louise
nor
could
his
pride
have
been
convinced
that
the
young
woman
at
his
side
was
enjoying
the
chiefly
because
de
cartier
was
fiercely
cursing
the
misfortune
which
had
thrown
this
new
element
into
conflict
it
may
be
unnecessary
to
say
that
garrison
was
delighted
with
the
unmistakable
signs
of
admiration
manifested
by
the
two
young
people
it
was
late
when
quentin
reluctantly
arose
to
make
his
adieux
he
had
finished
acknowledging
the
somewhat
effusive
invitations
to
the
houses
of
his
new
acquaintances
and
was
standing
near
dorothy
directly
in
front
of
a
tall
bank
of
palms
from
one
point
of
view
this
collection
of
plants
looked
like
a
dense
jungle
so
thickly
were
they
placed
on
the
porch
at
its
darkest
end
the
light
from
a
window
shone
across
the
front
of
the
green
mass
but
did
not
penetrate
the
recess
near
the
porch
rail
he
was
taking
advantage
of
a
very
brief
opportunity
while
others
were
moving
away
to
tell
her
that
mile
louise
was
fascinating
when
her
hand
suddenly
clasped
his
arm
and
she
whispered
phil
there
is
a
man
behind
those
his
figure
straightened
but
he
did
not
look
around
nonsense
dorothy
how
could
a
man
get
he
began
in
a
very
low
tone
i
saw
the
leaves
move
and
just
now
i
saw
a
foot
near
the
rail
be
careful
for
heaven
sake
but
look
for
yourself
he
is
near
the
like
statues
they
stood
she
rigid
under
the
strain
but
brave
enough
and
cool
enough
to
maintain
a
remarkable
composure
she
felt
the
muscle
of
his
forearm
contract
and
there
swept
over
her
a
strange
dread
his
eyes
sought
the
spot
indicated
in
a
perfectly
natural
manner
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
perturbation
in
his
gaze
or
posture
the
foot
of
a
man
was
dimly
discernible
in
the
shadow
protruding
from
behind
a
great
earthen
jar
without
a
word
he
led
her
across
the
porch
to
where
the
others
stood
garrison
he
said
calmly
taking
the
hand
she
proffered
dorothy
now
trembling
like
a
leaf
looked
on
in
mute
surprise
did
he
mean
to
depart
calmly
with
the
knowledge
that
they
needed
his
protection
miss
garrison
i
trust
i
shall
see
you
then
in
a
lower
tone
get
the
people
around
the
corner
here
and
not
a
word
to
the
ladies
were
quite
well
past
the
corner
before
he
ventured
to
tell
the
men
whom
he
held
back
on
some
trifling
pretext
that
there
was
a
man
among
the
plants
the
information
might
have
caused
a
small
panic
had
not
his
coolness
dominated
the
nerves
of
the
others
call
the
gendarmes
whispered
de
cartier
panic
stricken
call
the
we
do
want
the
officers
nor
the
servants
said
philip
coolly
let
the
ladies
get
inside
the
house
and
we
soon
have
a
look
at
our
fellow
but
he
may
be
armed
said
the
count
nervously
doubtless
he
is
burglars
usually
are
i
had
an
experience
with
an
armed
burglar
once
on
a
time
and
i
still
live
perhaps
a
few
palms
will
be
damaged
but
we
be
as
considerate
as
possible
there
is
no
time
to
lose
gentlemen
he
may
be
trying
to
escape
even
without
another
word
he
turned
and
walked
straight
toward
the
palms
not
another
man
followed
and
he
faced
the
unwelcome
guest
alone
faced
is
the
right
word
for
the
owner
of
the
telltale
foot
had
taken
advantage
of
their
momentary
absence
from
that
end
of
the
porch
to
make
a
hurried
and
reckless
attempt
to
leave
his
cramped
and
dangerous
he
was
crowding
through
the
outer
circle
of
huge
leaves
when
quentin
swung
into
view
the
light
from
the
window
was
full
in
the
face
of
the
stranger
white
scared
dogged
here
he
is
cried
quentin
leaping
forward
come
on
gentlemen
with
a
frantic
plunge
the
trapped
stranger
crashed
through
the
plants
crying
hoarsely
in
french
as
he
met
quentin
in
the
open
i
do
want
to
kill
you
keep
off
quentin
arm
shot
out
and
the
fellow
went
tumbling
back
among
the
pots
and
plants
he
was
up
in
an
instant
as
the
american
leaped
upon
him
for
the
second
blow
he
drove
his
hand
sharply
despairingly
toward
that
big
breast
there
came
the
ripping
of
cloth
the
tearing
of
flesh
and
something
hot
gushed
over
shoulder
and
arm
his
own
blow
landed
but
not
squarely
and
as
he
stumbled
forward
his
lithe
vicious
antagonist
sprang
aside
making
another
wild
but
ineffectual
sweep
with
the
knife
he
held
in
his
right
hand
before
quentin
could
recover
the
fellow
was
dashing
straight
toward
the
petrified
speechless
men
at
the
end
of
the
porch
where
they
had
been
joined
by
some
of
the
women
out
of
the
way
out
of
the
way
he
shrieked
brandishing
his
knife
through
the
huddled
bunch
he
threw
himself
unceremoniously
toppling
over
one
of
them
the
way
was
clear
and
he
was
down
the
steps
like
a
whirlwind
it
was
all
over
in
an
instant
time
but
before
the
witnesses
to
the
encounter
could
catch
the
second
breath
the
tall
form
of
philip
quentin
was
flying
down
the
steps
in
close
pursuit
out
into
the
avenue
louise
they
raced
the
fugitive
with
a
clear
lead
come
back
phil
cried
a
woman
voice
and
he
knew
the
tone
because
of
the
thrill
it
sent
to
his
heart
he
heard
others
running
behind
him
and
concluded
that
his
fellow
guests
had
regained
their
wits
and
were
in
the
chase
with
him
if
the
pursued
heard
the
sudden
convulsive
laugh
of
the
man
behind
him
he
must
have
wondered
greatly
phil
could
not
restrain
the
wild
desire
to
laugh
when
he
pictured
the
sudden
and
precipitous
halt
his
valiant
followers
would
be
compelled
to
make
if
the
fugitive
should
decide
to
stop
and
show
fight
one
or
more
of
them
would
doubtless
be
injured
in
the
impossible
effort
to
run
backward
while
still
going
forward
blood
was
streaming
down
his
arm
and
he
was
beginning
to
feel
an
excruciating
pain
pedestrians
were
few
and
they
made
no
effort
to
obstruct
the
flight
of
the
fugitive
instead
they
gave
him
a
wide
berth
from
far
in
the
rear
came
hoarse
cries
but
quentin
was
uttering
no
shout
he
was
grinding
his
teeth
because
the
fellow
had
worsted
him
in
the
rather
vainglorious
encounter
on
the
porch
and
was
doing
all
in
his
power
to
catch
him
and
make
things
even
to
his
dismay
the
fellow
was
gaining
on
him
and
he
was
losing
his
own
strength
cursing
the
frightened
men
who
allowed
the
thief
to
pass
on
unmolested
and
then
joined
in
the
chase
he
raced
panting
onward
the
flying
fugitive
suddenly
darted
into
a
narrow
dark
street
fifty
feet
ahead
of
his
pursuer
and
the
latter
felt
that
he
had
lost
him
completely
there
was
no
sign
of
him
when
quentin
turned
into
the
cross
street
he
had
disappeared
as
if
absorbed
by
the
earth
for
a
few
minutes
philip
and
the
mob
quite
large
inquisitive
and
eager
by
this
time
searched
for
a
trace
of
the
man
but
without
avail
the
count
de
cartier
and
the
honorable
knowlton
with
several
of
garrison
servants
came
puffing
up
and
to
his
amazement
and
rage
criticised
him
for
allowing
the
man
to
escape
they
argued
that
a
concerted
attack
on
the
recess
amongst
the
palms
would
have
overwhelmed
the
fellow
and
he
would
now
be
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
instead
of
as
free
as
air
quentin
endured
the
expostulations
of
his
companions
and
the
mirth
of
the
crowd
for
a
few
moments
in
dumb
surprise
then
he
turned
suddenly
to
retrace
his
steps
up
the
avenue
savagely
saying
if
i
had
waited
till
you
screwed
up
nerve
enough
to
make
a
combined
attack
the
man
would
not
have
been
obliged
to
take
this
long
and
tiresome
run
he
might
have
called
a
cab
and
ridden
away
in
peace
and
a
laugh
of
derision
came
from
the
crowd
and
the
two
frenchmen
looked
insulted
knowlton
flushed
with
shame
and
hurried
after
his
tall
countryman
you
are
right
quentin
you
right
he
wheezed
we
did
not
support
you
and
we
are
to
blame
you
did
the
brave
and
proper
thing
and
we
stood
by
like
a
lot
of
noodles
well
it
all
over
knowlton
and
we
all
did
the
best
we
could
responded
philip
with
intense
sarcasm
which
was
lost
on
knowlton
just
then
a
sturdy
little
figure
bumped
against
him
and
he
looked
down
as
the
newcomer
grasped
his
arm
tightly
hello

time

were
showing

three
discomfited

rear

the
villain

me
with
a
by
this
time
they
were
in
front
of
the
garrison
home
and
in
an
undertone
he
bade
turk
walk
on
and
wait
for
him
at
the
corner
below
did
he
escape
cried
dorothy
from
the
steps
he
gave
us
the
slip
confound

i
glad

i
am
what

in
oh
not
thank
you
ca
you
have
some
one
bring
out
my
hat
and
coat
he
was
beginning
to
feel
faint
and
sick
and
purposely
kept
the
bloody
arm
from
the
light
you
shall
not
have
them
unless
you
come
in
for
them
besides
we
want
you

with
excitement
madame
de
cartier
fainted
and
mamma
is
almost
worried
to
are
you
not
coming
up
quentin
called
garrison
from
the
veranda
you
must
come
in
said
de
cartier
coming
up
at
that
moment
with
the
count
and
knowlton
really
i
must
go
to
the
hotel
i
am
a
little
faint
after
that
wretched
run
let
me
go
please
do
insist
on
my
coming
in
he
said
mon
dieu
exclaimed
the
count
it
is
blood
monsieur
you
are
hurt
oh
not
in
the
least
merely
a
phil
cried
dorothy
standing
in
front
of
him
her
wide
eyes
looking
intently
into
his
are
you
hurt
tell
me
just
a
little
cut
in
the
arm
or
shoulder
i
think
does
amount
to
anything
i
assure
come
in
the
house
at
once
philip
quentin
she
exclaimed
mr
knowlton
will
you
ask
franz
to
telephone
for
berier
then
she
saw
the
hand
and
shuddered
turning
her
face
away
oh
phil
she
whispered
that
pays
for
this
cut
and
more
if
necessary
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
he
walked
at
her
side
up
the
steps
lean
on
me
phil
she
said
you
must
be
he
laughed
merrily
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
something
not
akin
to
pain
berier
came
and
closed
the
gash
in
his
shoulder
an
hour
later
he
came
downstairs
to
find
garrison
and
dorothy
alone
you
were
very
brave
quentin
but
very
foolhardy
said
garrison
i
hope
from
my
heart
the
wound
will
give
you
little
his
good
right
hand
closed
over
hers
for
an
instant
and
then
clasped
dorothy
warmly
lingeringly
you
must
let
us
hear
from
you
said
she
softly
expect
me
to
fetch
the
message
in
person
said
he
and
he
was
off
down
the
steps
he
did
not
look
back
or
he
might
have
seen
her
standing
on
the
veranda
her
eyes
following
him
till
he
was
joined
by
another
man
at
the
corner
below
xii
he
claimed
a
day
the
strange
experience
of
the
evening
brought
quentin
sharply
to
a
sense
of
realization
it
proved
to
him
that
he
was
feared
else
why
the
unusual
method
of
campaign
to
what
extent
the
conspirators
would
carry
their
seemingly
unnecessary
warfare
he
was
now
for
the
first
time
able
to
form
some
sort
of
opinion
the
remarkable
boldness
of
the
spy
at
the
garrison
home
left
room
for
considerable
speculation
as
to
his
motive
what
was
his
design
and
what
would
have
been
the
ending
to
his
sinister
vigil
before
quentin
slept
that
night
he
came
to
the
drowsy
conclusion
that
luck
had
really
been
with
him
despite
his
wound
and
courant
escape
and
that
the
sudden
exposure
of
the
spy
destroyed
the
foundation
for
an
important
move
in
the
powderless
conflict
in
the
morning
his
shoulder
was
so
sore
that
the
surgeon
informed
him
he
could
not
use
the
arm
for
several
days
turk
philosophically
bore
the
brunt
of
his
master
ire
like
a
little
napoleon
he
endured
the
savage
assaults
from
quentin
vocal
batteries
taking
them
as
lamentations
instead
of
imprecations
the
morning
newspapers
mentioned
the
attempt
to
rob
garrison
house
and
soundly
deplored
the
unstrategic
and
attempt
of
an
american
named
canton
to
capture
the
desperado
the
police
department
is
severe
in
its
criticism
of
the
childish
act
which
allowed
the
wretch
to
escape
detection
without
leaving
the
faintest
clew
behind
officers
were
close
at
hand
and
the
slightest
warning
would
have
had
them
at
the
garrison
home
the
capture
of
this
man
would
have
meant
much
to
the
department
as
he
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
diamond
robbers
who
are
working
havoc
in
brussels
at
this
time
he
was
it
is
stated
positively
by
the
police
not
alone
in
his
operations
last
night
his
duty
it
is
believed
was
to
obtain
the
lay
of
the
land
and
to
give
the
signal
at
the
proper
moment
for
a
careful
and
systematic
raid
of
the
wealthy
woman
house
the
police
now
fear
that
the
robbers
whose
daring
exploits
have
shocked
and
alarmed
all
brussels
are
on
their
guard
and
a
plan
to
effect
their
capture
is
ruined
a
prominent
attache
of
the
department
is
of
the
opinion
that
an
attempt
was
to
have
been
made
by
the
band
to
relieve
all
of
garrison
guests
of
their
jewels
in
a
sensational
game
of
and
deliver
the
miserable
asses
exploded
phil
when
read
the
foregoing
that
is
the
worst
rot
i
ever
read
this
police
department
catch
a
thief
if
he
were
tied
to
a
tree
turk
if
they
were
so
near
at
hand
why
the
devil
did
they
get
into
the
chase
with
me
and
run
that
fellow
down
th
chances
are
they
was
in
th
chase
quentin
but
they
get
th
proper
direction
they
thought
he
was
bein
chased
th
other
way
an
i
would
be
surprised
if
some
of
run
five
or
six
miles
before
they
stopped
t
if
there
is
a
gang
of
diamond
robbers
or
comic
opera
bandits
in
this
city
i
bet
my
hand
they
could
steal
the
sidewalks
without
being
detected
much
less
captured
a
scheme
to
rob
all
of
garrison
guests
the
asses
do
get
excited
sir
you
burst
a
blood
vessel
an
that
a
good
sight
worse
than
a
cut
cautioned
turk
turk
in
all
your
burglarious
years
did
you
ever
go
about
robbing
a
house
in
that
manner
not
in
a
million
well
what
are
we
to
do
next
demanded
quentin
reflectively
ignoring
his
former
question
and
turk
specific
answer
shall
we
give
the
police
all
the
information
we
have
and
land
courant
in
jail
this
is
our
game
sir
not
th
police
for
th
lord
sake
give
anything
up
to
th
cops
they
raise
particular
thunder
in
their
sleep
an
we
gets
th
rough
ha
ha
from
our
frien
enemy
we
pipes
this
little
game
ourself
an
we
wins
too
if
we
succeed
in
keepin
th
police
from
gettin
nex
to
anything
mistake
for
a
phil
thought
long
and
hard
before
sitting
down
at
noon
to
write
to
dickey
savage
he
disliked
calling
for
help
in
the
contest
but
with
a
bandaged
arm
and
the
odds
against
him
he
finally
resolved
that
he
needed
the
young
new
yorker
at
his
side
dickey
was
deliberation
itself
and
he
was
brave
and
loyal
so
the
afternoon
post
carried
a
letter
to
savage
who
was
still
in
london
asking
him
to
come
to
brussels
at
once
if
he
could
do
so
conveniently
the
same
post
carried
a
letter
to
lord
bob
and
in
it
the
writer
admitted
that
he
might
need
reinforcements
before
the
campaign
closed
he
also
inclosed
the
clipping
from
the
newspaper
but
added
a
choice
and
caustic
opinion
of
the
efficiency
of
the
brussels
police
he
did
not
allude
specifically
to
courant
the
duke
or
to
the
queer
beginning
of
the
prince
campaign
early
in
the
afternoon
garrison
sent
to
inquire
as
to
his
wound
in
reply
he
calmly
prepared
for
an
appearance
in
person
turk
accompanied
him
about
four
in
a
cab
to
the
house
in
avenue
louise
there
were
guests
and
phil
was
forced
to
endure
a
rather
effusive
series
of
feminine
exclamations
and
several
polite
expressions
from
men
who
sincerely
believed
they
could
have
done
better
had
they
been
in
his
place
garrison
was
a
trifle
distant
at
first
but
as
she
saw
quentin
elevated
to
the
pedestal
of
a
god
for
feminine
worship
she
thawed
diplomatically
and
with
rare
tact
assumed
a
sort
of
proprietorship
dorothy
remained
in
the
background
but
he
caught
anxious
glances
at
his
arm
and
once
or
twice
a
serious
contemplation
of
his
face
i
let
her
think
the
fellow
was
one
of
the
diamond
robbers
for
the
present
thought
he
she
would
believe
me
if
i
told
her
he
was
in
the
employ
of
the
prince
and
the
chances
are
she
ruin
everything
by
writing
to
him
about
when
at
last
he
found
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
her
alone
he
asked
how
she
had
slept
not
at
all
not
a
wink
not
a
blink
i
imagined
i
heard
robbers
in
every
part
of
the
house
are
you
speaking
the
truth
when
you
tell
all
these
people
it
is
a
mere
scratch
i
am
sure
it
is
much
worse
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
truth
she
said
earnestly
i
had
deeper
cuts
that
did
bleed
a
drop
said
he
if
you
must
have
the
truth
dorothy
i
confess
the
fellow
gave
me
a
rather
nasty
slash
and
i
do
blame
him
he
had
to
do
it
and
just
as
lucky
as
i
am
perhaps
that
it
was
no
worse
i
wish
to
compliment
your
brussels
police
too
on
being
veritable
bloodhounds
i
observed
as
i
came
in
that
they
have
at
last
scented
the
blood
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
house
and
have
washed
away
the
stain
fairly
was
the
story
in
the
morning
paper
ridiculous
you
were
very
brave
i
almost
cried
when
i
saw
how
the
horrid
detectives
criticised
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
because
i
was
afraid
you
think
like
the
rest
that
i
was
a
blundering
you
did
not
fear
anything
of
the
kind
do
you
really
think
he
was
one
of
those
awful
diamond
robbers
who
are
terrorizing
the
town
i
could
not
sleep
another
wink
if
i
thought
so
why
last
spring
a
rich
merchant
and
his
wife
were
drugged
in
one
of
the
cafes
taken
by
carriage
to
watermael
where
they
were
stripped
of
their
valuables
and
left
by
the
did
you
see
an
account
of
the
affair
in
your
morning
paper
yes
there
were
columns
about
then
i
think
of
the
crime
was
committed
at
a
city
editor
desk
it
my
opinion
these
diamond
thieves
are
a
set
of
ordinary
pickpockets
and
petty
porch
climbers
a
couple
of
new
york
policemen
could
catch
the
whole
lot
in
a
but
really
phil
they
are
very
bold
and
they
are
not
at
all
ordinary
you
do
know
how
thankful
we
are
that
this
one
was
discovered
before
he
got
into
the
house
did
he
have
a
knife
well
was
it
to
kill
us
with
if
we
made
an
outcry
she
was
nervous
and
excited
and
he
had
it
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
allay
her
fears
by
telling
what
he
thought
to
be
the
true
object
of
the
man
visit
well
no
matter
what
he
intended
to
do
he
did
do
it
and
never
come
back
to
try
it
again
he
will
steer
clear
of
this
house
he
said
reassuringly
a
week
two
weeks
went
by
without
a
change
in
the
situation
dickey
savage
replied
that
he
would
come
to
brussels
as
soon
as
his
heart
trouble
would
permit
him
to
leave
london
and
that
would
probably
be
about
the
twentieth
of
august
in
parentheses
he
said
he
hoped
to
be
out
of
danger
by
that
time
the
duke
was
persistent
in
his
friendliness
and
courant
had
to
all
intents
and
purposes
disappeared
completely
prince
ugo
was
expected
daily
and
garrison
was
beginning
to
breathe
easily
again
the
police
had
given
up
the
effort
to
find
the
garrison
robber
and
turk
had
learned
everything
that
was
to
be
known
concerning
the
house
in
which
courant
found
shelter
after
eluding
his
pursuers
on
the
night
of
the
affray
quentin
shoulder
was
almost
entirely
healed
and
he
was
beginning
to
feel
himself
again
the
two
weeks
had
found
him
a
constant
and
persistent
visitor
at
miss
garrison
home
but
he
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
had
made
no
progress
in
his
crusade
against
her
heart
she
baffled
him
at
every
turn
and
he
was
beginning
to
lose
his
confident
hopes
at
no
time
during
their
their
walks
their
drives
their
visits
to
the
art
galleries
did
she
give
him
the
slightest
ground
for
encouragement
and
to
further
disturb
his
sense
of
contentment
she
was
delighted
positively
delighted
over
the
coming
of
prince
ugo
for
a
week
she
had
talked
of
little
save
the
day
when
he
was
to
arrive
quentin
endured
these
rapturous
assaults
nobly
but
he
was
slowly
beginning
to
realize
that
they
were
battering
down
the
only
defense
he
had
the
inward
belief
that
she
cared
for
him
in
spite
of
all
frequently
he
met
the
duke
laselli
at
the
garrisons
he
also
saw
a
great
deal
of
the
de
cartiers
and
mile
gaudelet
when
one
day
he
boldly
intimated
to
dorothy
that
de
cartier
was
in
love
with
louise
and
she
with
him
that
young
lady
essayed
to
look
shocked
and
displeased
but
he
was
sure
he
saw
a
quick
gleam
of
satisfaction
in
her
eyes
and
he
was
positive
the
catch
in
her
breath
was
not
so
much
of
horror
as
it
was
of
joy
garrison
did
all
in
her
power
to
bring
him
and
the
pretty
french
girl
together
and
her
insistence
amused
him
one
day
her
plans
if
she
had
any
went
racing
skyward
and
she
as
well
as
all
brussels
society
was
stunned
by
the
news
that
de
cartier
had
deserted
his
wife
to
elope
with
the
fair
gaudelet
when
quentin
laconically
perhaps
maliciously
observed
that
he
had
long
suspected
the
nature
of
their
regard
for
one
another
garrison
gave
him
a
withering
look
and
subsided
into
a
chilling
unresponsiveness
that
boded
ill
for
the
perceiving
young
man
the
inconsiderate
transgression
of
de
cartier
and
the
unkindness
of
the
gaudelet
upset
her
plans
cruelly
and
she
found
that
she
had
wasted
time
irreparably
in
trying
to
bring
the
meddling
american
to
the
feet
of
the
french
woman
quentin
revelled
in
her
discomfiture
and
dorothy
in
secret
enjoyed
the
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
she
had
seen
through
her
mother
design
and
she
had
known
all
along
how
ineffectual
it
would
prove
in
the
end
philip
puzzled
her
and
piqued
her
more
than
she
cared
to
admit
that
she
did
not
care
for
him
except
as
a
friend
she
was
positive
but
that
he
should
persistently
betray
signs
of
nothing
more
than
the
most
ordinary
friendship
was
far
from
pleasing
to
her
vanity
the
truth
is
she
had
expected
him
to
go
on
his
knees
to
her
an
event
which
would
have
simplified
matters
exceedingly
it
would
have
given
her
the
opportunity
to
tell
him
plainly
she
could
be
no
more
than
a
friend
and
it
would
have
served
to
alter
his
course
in
what
she
believed
to
be
a
stubborn
love
chase
but
he
had
disappointed
her
he
had
been
the
amusing
companion
the
ready
friend
the
same
sunny
spirit
and
she
was
perplexed
to
observe
that
he
gave
forth
no
indication
of
hoping
or
even
desiring
to
be
more
she
could
not
of
course
know
that
this
apparently
indifferent
young
gentleman
was
wiser
far
wiser
than
the
rest
of
his
kind
he
saw
the
folly
of
a
rash
hasty
leap
in
the
dark
and
bided
his
time
like
the
cunning
general
who
from
afar
sees
the
hopelessness
of
an
attack
against
a
strong
and
watchful
adversary
and
waits
for
the
inevitable
hour
when
the
vigil
is
relaxed
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
with
all
his
confidence
his
colors
were
sinking
while
hers
remained
as
gallantly
fluttering
as
when
the
struggle
began
he
was
becoming
confused
and
nervous
a
feeling
of
impotence
began
slyly
devilishly
to
assail
him
and
he
frequently
found
himself
far
out
at
sea
the
strange
inactivity
of
the
prince
cohorts
the
significant
friendliness
of
the
duke
the
everlasting
fear
that
a
sudden
move
might
catch
him
unawares
began
to
tell
on
his
peace
of
mind
both
he
and
turk
watched
like
cats
for
the
slightest
move
that
might
betray
the
intentions
of
the
foe
but
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
the
house
in
which
courant
found
safety
was
watched
but
it
gave
forth
no
secrets
the
every
movement
appeared
to
be
as
open
as
fair
as
unsuspicious
as
man
could
be
and
yet
there
was
ever
present
the
feeling
that
some
day
something
would
snap
and
a
crisis
would
rush
upon
them
late
one
afternoon
he
drove
up
to
the
house
in
avenue
louise
and
when
dorothy
came
downstairs
for
the
drive
her
face
was
beaming
ugo
comes
she
said
as
they
crossed
to
the
carriage
which
means
that
i
am
to
be
relegated
to
the
dark
he
said
dolefully
oh
no
ugo
likes
you
and
i
like
you
you
know
why
are
we
not
to
be
the
same
good
friends
as
now
she
asked
suddenly
with
a
pretty
show
of
surprise
oh
i
suppose
so
he
said
looking
straight
ahead
they
were
driving
rapidly
toward
the
bois
de
la
cambre
but
of
course
not
rob
the
prince
of
moments
that
belong
to
him
by
right
of
conquest
you
may
expect
to
see
me
driving
disconsolately
along
the
avenue
mr
savage
will
be
here
she
said
sweetly
enjoying
his
first
show
of
misery
but
he
in
love
and
he
not
be
thinking
of
me
i
the
only
one
in
all
christendom
it
seems
to
me
who
is
not
in
love
with
somebody
and
it
an
awful
you
will
fall
really
in
love
some
day
never
fear
she
volunteered
after
a
somewhat
convulsive
twist
of
the
head
in
his
direction
unquestionably
he
said
and
i
shall
be
just
as
happy
and
as
foolish
as
the
rest
of
you
i
i
should
enjoy
seeing
you
really
and
truly
in
love
with
some
girl
it
would
be
so
a
perfect
comedy
i
am
sure
i
must
say
however
that
i
feel
sorry
for
the
girl
i
loved
if
she
did
happen
to
love
and
why
pray
because
he
said
turning
abruptly
and
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
she
have
the
trouble
and
distinction
of
surrendering
in
the
you
vain
conceited
thing
she
exclaimed
a
trifle
disconcerted
you
overestimate
your
do
you
think
i
overestimate
it
he
demanded
quickly
i
don
t
do
know
how
should
i
know
she
cried
in
complete
rout
in
deep
chagrin
she
realized
that
he
had
driven
her
sharply
into
unaccountable
confusion
and
that
her
wits
were
scattering
hopelessly
at
the
very
moment
when
she
needed
them
most
then
why
do
you
say
i
overestimate
it
he
asked
relentlessly
because
you
do
she
exclaimed
at
bay
are
you
a
competent
judge
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
grasping
for
time
i
mean
have
you
the
right
to
question
my
power
as
you
call
it
have
i
attempted
to
exert
it
over
you
you
are
talking
nonsense
phil
she
said
spiritedly
i
said
i
feel
sorry
for
the
girl
if
she
did
happen
to
love
me
you
know
well
i
could
force
her
to
love
me
if
she
did
love
me
could
i
certainly
not
that
is
what
i
meant
she
cried
immensely
relieved
but
my
point
is
that
she
might
love
me
without
knowing
it
and
would
simply
have
to
be
brought
to
the
oh
she
said
that
is
you
take
back
what
you
said
then
he
asked
maliciously
if
she
loved
you
and
did
not
know
it
she
be
a
fool
and
you
could
exert
any
kind
of
power
over
her
you
see
we
did
quite
understand
each
other
did
we
that
is
for
you
to
say
he
said
smiling
significantly
i
think
i
understand
by
this
time
they
were
opposite
the
rue
lesbroussart
and
he
drove
toward
the
place
ste
croix
as
they
made
the
turn
she
gave
a
start
and
peered
excitedly
up
the
avenue
louise
first
in
front
of
her
companion
then
behind
oh
phil
there
is
ugo
she
cried
clasping
his
arm
see
in
the
trap
coming
toward
he
looked
quickly
but
the
trees
and
houses
now
hid
the
other
trap
from
view
are
you
sure
it
is
he
oh
i
am
positive
he
has
come
to
surprise
me
is
there
no
way
we
can
reach
the
house
first
by
the
rear
anyway
she
cried
excitedly
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
sparkling
was
he
alone
asked
he
his
jaw
setting
suddenly
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
we
must
hurry
home
turn
back
phil
we
may
be
able
to
overtake
him
on
the
i
wanted
to
take
you
to
the
park
well
that
all
he
went
on
calmly
the
prince
can
leave
his
card
and
call
later
in
the
well
this
what
you
do
mean
philip
quentin
take
me
home
instantly
she
blazed
not
for
all
the
princes
in
the
universe
he
said
this
is
my
afternoon
and
i
will
not
give
up
a
minute
of
but
i
command
sir
and
i
refuse
to
oh
oh
this
is
outrageous
she
began
frantically
suddenly
his
gloved
left
hand
dropped
from
the
reins
and
closed
over
one
of
hers
the
feverish
clasp
and
the
command
in
his
eyes
compelled
her
to
look
up
into
his
face
quickly
there
she
saw
the
look
she
feared
admired
deserved
there
was
a
time
when
you
wanted
to
be
with
me
and
with
no
other
i
have
not
forgotten
those
days
nor
have
you
they
were
the
sweetest
days
of
your
life
and
of
mine
it
is
no
age
since
i
held
this
hand
in
mine
and
you
would
have
gone
to
the
end
of
the
world
with
me
it
is
no
age
since
you
kissed
me
and
called
me
a
king
it
is
no
age
since
you
looked
into
my
eyes
with
an
expression
far
different
from
the
one
you
now
have
you
remember
you
remember
she
was
too
surprised
to
answer
too
overcome
by
the
suddenness
of
his
assault
to
resist
the
power
she
had
undertaken
to
estimate
was
in
his
eyes
strong
plain
relentless
and
because
you
remember
i
can
see
the
hardness
going
from
your
eyes
the
tenderness
replacing
it
the
flush
in
your
cheek
is
not
so
much
of
anger
as
it
was
your
heart
is
not
beating
in
rebellion
as
it
was
and
all
because
you
can
not
forget
you
will
not
this
is
madness
she
cried
shivering
as
with
a
mighty
chill
madness
it
may
be
dorothy
but
well
because
we
have
not
forgotten
the
days
when
we
were
sweethearts
i
am
claiming
this
day
of
you
and
you
must
give
it
to
me
for
the
same
reason
you
must
say
to
me
that
you
give
it
willingly
he
half
whispered
intensely
she
could
only
look
helplessly
into
his
eyes
from
the
rumble
turk
saw
nothing
neither
did
he
hear
xiii
some
ugly
looking
men
prince
ugo
ravorelli
was
not
that
day
the
only
one
whose
coming
to
brussels
was
of
interest
to
quentin
dickey
savage
came
in
from
ostend
and
was
waiting
at
the
bellevue
when
he
walked
in
soon
after
six
savage
found
a
warm
welcome
from
the
tall
young
man
who
had
boldly
confiscated
several
hours
that
belonged
properly
to
the
noble
bridegroom
and
it
was
not
long
until
dinner
over
he
was
lolling
back
in
a
chair
in
quentin
room
his
feet
cocked
on
the
window
sill
listening
with
a
fair
and
increasing
show
of
interest
to
the
confidences
his
friend
was
pouring
forth
so
you
deliberately
drove
off
and
left
the
prince
eh
and
she
did
sulk
or
call
you
a
nasty
horrid
beast
i
do
know
what
the
devil
you
want
me
here
for
if
you
got
such
a
start
as
that
seems
to
me
i
be
in
the
way
more
or
less
said
dickey
when
the
story
reached
a
point
where
to
him
finis
was
the
only
appropriate
word
that
the
deuce
of
it
dickey
i
ca
say
that
i
got
a
safe
start
at
all
even
with
her
and
i
certainly
got
some
distance
to
go
before
i
can
put
the
prince
out
of
the
running
you
may
think
this
is
a
nice
easy
straightaway
race
but
it
is
it
going
to
be
a
steeplechase
and
i
do
know
the
course
i
looking
for
a
wide
ditch
at
any
turn
and
i
may
get
a
nasty
fall
you
see
some
chance
of
getting
my
neck
broken
before
i
get
to
the
and
some
noted
genius
will
be
grinding
out
that
lohengrin
just
about
the
time
you
get
within
hearing
distance
too
you
be
down
the
aisle
at
gudule
but
you
agree
that
it
a
very
pretty
party
that
will
be
all
my
boy
really
all
i
do
want
to
discourage
you
and
i
willing
to
stay
by
you
till
that
place
freezes
over
but
i
think
an
ocean
voyage
would
be
very
good
for
you
if
you
can
arrange
to
start
if
you
going
into
this
thing
with
that
sort
of
spirit
you
be
a
dead
weight
and
i
be
left
at
the
post
said
quentin
ruefully
was
the
prince
at
the
house
when
you
returned
from
the
drive
no
and
garrison
almost
glared
a
hole
through
me
there
were
icicles
on
every
word
when
she
told
poor
dorothy
he
had
been
there
and
would
return
this
was
she
satisfied
to
finish
the
drive
with
you
after
she
had
seen
the
prince
quentin
had
not
told
him
of
the
conversation
which
followed
her
demand
to
be
taken
home
she
was
very
sensible
about
it
he
admitted
carefully
you
see
she
had
an
engagement
with
me
and
as
a
lady
she
could
not
well
break
it
we
got
along
very
nicely
all
things
considered
but
afraid
she
wo
go
out
again
with
she
wo
slam
the
door
in
your
face
if
you
go
to
the
house
will
she
hardly
said
the
other
smiling
she
has
asked
me
to
come
the
prince
likes
me
it
but
he
likes
to
be
alone
with
her
i
should
say
well
interfere
when
he
is
there
my
boy
give
him
a
chance
said
dickey
with
a
twinkle
the
duke
headed
off
the
two
americans
as
they
left
the
hotel
half
an
hour
later
he
was
evidently
watching
for
them
and
his
purpose
was
clear
it
was
his
duty
to
prevent
quentin
from
going
to
the
garrison
home
if
possible
after
shaking
hands
with
savage
the
little
man
suggested
a
visit
to
a
dance
house
in
the
lower
end
promising
an
evening
of
rare
sport
he
and
count
sallaconi
who
came
up
from
paris
with
the
prince
had
planned
a
little
excursion
into
unusual
haunts
and
he
hoped
the
americans
had
a
few
dull
hours
that
needed
brightening
phil
savagely
admitted
to
himself
that
he
anticipated
a
good
many
dull
hours
but
they
could
not
be
banished
by
the
vulgarity
of
a
dance
hall
the
long
bony
count
came
up
at
this
moment
and
joined
in
imploring
the
young
men
to
go
with
them
to
the
gayest
place
in
all
let
go
phil
just
to
see
how
much
worse
our
new
york
places
are
than
theirs
said
dickey
but
i
have
a
er
sort
of
an
engagement
remonstrated
quentin
reluctantly
the
duke
gave
him
a
sharp
look
do
not
be
afraid
he
said
laughing
easily
we
will
not
permit
the
dancing
girls
to
harm
he
not
afraid
of
girls
interposed
dickey
girls
are
his
long
suit
you
did
tell
me
you
had
an
engagement
quentin
gave
him
a
withering
look
i
have
one
just
the
same
he
said
harshly
you
will
not
accompany
us
then
said
the
count
the
line
between
his
eyebrows
growing
deeper
i
have
to
thank
you
gentlemen
and
to
plead
a
previous
engagement
may
we
not
go
some
other
night
i
am
afraid
we
shall
not
again
be
in
the
same
mood
for
pleasure
said
the
duke
shifting
his
eyes
nervously
the
count
and
i
have
but
little
time
to
give
to
frivolity
we
are
disappointed
that
you
will
not
join
us
on
this
one
night
of
i
regret
it
exceedingly
but
if
you
knew
what
i
have
to
do
you
would
not
insist
said
phil
purposely
throwing
a
cloak
of
mystery
about
his
intentions
for
the
mere
satisfaction
of
arousing
their
curiosity
very
well
mes
americains
we
will
not
implore
you
longer
responded
the
count
carelessly
may
your
evening
be
as
pleasant
as
the
two
italians
bowed
deeply
linked
arms
and
strolled
away
say
those
fellows
know
you
have
an
engagement
exclaimed
savage
wrathfully
what
sort
of
an
ass
are
you
see
here
dickey
you
still
got
something
to
learn
in
this
world
do
imagine
you
know
everything
you
do
you
know
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
walk
into
one
of
their
traps
with
my
eyes
open
traps
you
do
mean
to
say
this
dance
hall
business
is
a
trap
exclaimed
dickey
his
eyes
opening
wide
with
an
interest
entirely
foreign
to
his
placid
nature
i
do
know
and
that
why
i
am
keeping
out
of
it
now
take
our
walk
a
nice
cool
drink
or
two
and
go
to
bed
where
we
can
dream
about
what
might
have
happened
to
us
at
the
dance
where
does
she
live
asked
savage
as
they
left
the
rotunda
avenue
louise
was
the
laconic
answer
why
do
you
say
belgium
or
europe
if
you
bound
to
be
explicit
growled
dickey
a
young
man
came
from
the
hotel
a
few
paces
behind
them
and
followed
swinging
his
light
cane
leisurely
across
the
place
in
the
shadow
of
a
tall
building
the
two
italian
noblemen
saw
the
americans
depart
noting
the
direction
they
took
it
was
toward
the
avenue
louise
a
smile
of
satisfaction
came
to
their
faces
when
the
dapper
stranger
made
his
appearance
a
few
moments
later
they
were
speeding
in
a
cab
toward
the
avenue
that
is
her
house
said
phil
later
on
as
the
two
strolled
slowly
down
the
avenue
louise
they
were
across
the
street
from
the
garrison
home
and
the
hid
them
the
tall
lover
knew
however
that
the
italian
was
with
her
and
that
his
willfulness
of
the
afternoon
had
availed
him
naught
nor
could
he
recall
a
single
atom
of
hope
and
encouragement
his
bold
act
had
produced
other
than
the
simple
fact
that
she
had
submitted
as
gracefully
as
possible
to
the
inevitable
and
had
made
the
best
of
it
ugo
has
the
center
of
the
stage
and
everybody
else
is
in
the
orchestra
playing
fiddles
of
secondary
importance
while
miss
dorothy
is
the
lone
and
only
audience
reflected
dickey
i
wish
you
confine
your
miserable
speculations
to
the
weather
dickey
said
the
other
testily
with
pleasure
will
be
a
delightful
day
for
a
drive
or
a
stroll
you
and
i
having
nothing
else
to
do
can
take
an
drive
into
the
country
and
get
acquainted
with
the
belgian
birds
and
bees
and
the
hares
do
be
an
ass
what
sort
of
a
game
do
you
think
those
italians
were
up
to
this
evening
i
as
nervous
as
the
devil
it
time
for
the
game
to
come
to
a
head
and
we
may
as
well
expect
something
i
think
it
depends
on
the
prince
if
he
finds
that
you
have
torn
down
his
fences
while
you
had
full
sway
he
not
be
obliged
to
go
on
with
the
game
he
was
merely
protecting
interests
that
absence
endangered
now
that
he
here
and
if
all
is
smooth
and
undisturbed
or
in
other
words
if
you
have
failed
in
your
merciless
design
to
put
a
few
permanent
and
unhealable
dents
in
the
fair
lady
heart
he
will
certainly
discharge
his
cohorts
and
enjoy
very
smooth
seas
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
if
you
have
disfigured
her
tender
heart
by
trying
to
break
into
it
as
a
gets
into
those
large
steel
things
we
call
safety
deposit
vaults
where
other
men
keep
things
they
do
care
to
lose
i
must
say
that
his
satanic
majesty
will
be
to
pay
do
you
think
you
have
made
any
perceptible
dents
or
do
you
think
the
safe
is
as
strong
and
as
impregnable
as
it
was
when
you
began
using
chisels
and
dynamite
on
it
six
weeks
ago
i
ca
say
that
i
enjoy
the
simile
but
i
conceited
enough
to
think
it
is
not
as
free
from
dents
as
it
was
when
i
began
i
not
quite
sure
about
it
but
i
believe
with
a
little
more
time
and
security
against
interference
i
might
have
er
have
got
away
with
the
swag
as
turk
would
say
well
it
this
way
if
the
prince
investigates
and
finds
that
you
were
frightened
away
just
in
time
to
prevent
wholesale
looting
you
have
to
do
some
expert
dodging
to
escape
the
consequences
of
the
crime
he
have
the
duke
and
the
count
and
a
few
others
do
nothing
but
get
up
surprise
parties
for
that
it
dickey
that
what
i
afraid
of
the
surprise
parties
he
afraid
of
me
or
he
would
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
having
me
watched
they
got
something
brewing
or
they
have
been
so
quiet
for
the
past
two
weeks
courant
is
gone
and
how
do
you
know
courant
is
here
turk
says
he
has
turk
does
know
everything
that
fellow
may
have
a
score
of
disguises
these
french
detectives
are
great
on
false
whiskers
and
dramatic
possibilities
the
chances
are
that
he
has
been
watching
you
night
and
day
and
i
bet
my
head
if
he
has
he
been
able
to
tell
ugo
more
about
your
affair
with
miss
garrison
than
you
know
yourself
my
they
turned
to
retrace
their
steps
phil
gloomily
surveying
the
big
house
across
the
way
a
man
met
them
and
made
room
for
them
to
pass
on
the
narrow
walk
he
was
a
jaunty
young
fellow
and
the
others
would
have
observed
nothing
peculiar
about
him
had
they
not
caught
him
looking
intently
toward
the
house
which
was
of
such
interest
to
them
as
he
passed
them
he
peered
closely
at
their
faces
and
so
strange
was
his
manner
that
both
involuntarily
turned
their
heads
to
look
after
him
as
is
usually
the
case
he
also
turned
to
look
at
them
i
saw
that
in
the
hotel
said
savage
five
minutes
later
they
met
turk
and
before
they
could
utter
a
word
of
protest
he
was
leading
them
into
the
rue
du
prince
royal
there
a
guy
follerin
you
he
explained
an
th
two
swells
is
drivin
aroun
in
a
cab
like
as
if
they
wuz
expectin
fun
they
just
passed
you
on
th
avenoo
an
now
they
comin
back
that
their
rig
cuttin
across
there
see
i
tell
you
they
somethin
in
the
air
an
it
looks
as
though
it
ai
goin
to
pan
out
as
they
wanted
it
what
the
matter
with
you
the
duke
and
the
count
went
to
a
dance
hall
expostulated
quentin
to
make
a
night
of
it
added
savage
did
you
see
a
nice
lookin
feller
up
there
in
th
avenoo
did
he
size
you
up
purty
close
that
him
that
courant
fly
cop
git
inside
this
doorway
an
you
see
him
pass
yere
in
a
couple
of
seconds
he
not
a
block
behind
sure
enough
the
dapper
stranger
passed
by
the
three
men
in
shadow
looking
uneasily
nervously
up
and
across
the
street
he
lost
th
trail
whispered
turk
after
courant
was
beyond
hearing
the
same
fellow
i
be
blowed
said
dickey
in
amazement
now
what
do
you
suppose
the
game
is
my
idea
is
that
you
turned
down
on
th
dance
hall
job
they
was
afraid
you
go
to
th
young
lady
house
and
cut
in
on
prince
cinch
so
they
had
to
git
a
move
on
to
head
you
off
you
was
wise
you
kicked
out
of
th
dance
hall
racket
th
chances
are
you
got
into
all
kinds
o
hell
if
you
fell
into
trap
say
i
dead
sure
o
one
er
two
in
th
first
place
they
got
four
or
five
more
ringers
than
we
know
about
i
seen
courant
talkin
mighty
to
two
waiters
in
th
hall
this
evenin
an
th
driver
o
that
cab
o
theirn
was
a
baggage
hustler
at
th
bellyvoo
as
late
as
by
thunder
i
believe
their
game
was
to
mix
us
up
in
a
big
fight
when
they
got
us
into
that
dance
dive
that
shows
dickey
how
wise
i
was
to
decline
the
invitation
said
quentin
seriously
by
this
time
they
were
some
distance
behind
turk
following
in
the
path
of
the
puzzled
detective
they
saw
him
look
curiously
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
houses
and
overtook
him
at
the
intersection
of
the
boulevard
waterloo
just
as
they
came
up
from
behind
courant
stopped
for
an
instant
conversation
with
two
men
their
talk
was
brief
and
the
trio
turned
to
go
back
over
the
path
just
traversed
by
courant
the
two
sets
of
men
met
fairly
and
were
compelled
to
make
room
for
each
other
to
pass
courant
came
to
a
full
stop
involuntarily
but
recovered
himself
and
followed
his
friends
quickly
the
plot
thickens
observed
phil
it
looks
as
though
they
are
rounding
up
their
forces
after
the
miscarriage
of
the
original
plan
gad
they
are
hunting
us
down
like
rats
the
hotel
is
the
safest
place
for
us
and
the
quicker
we
get
there
the
better
said
dickey
i
not
armed
are
you
of
course
not
i
had
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
from
now
on
i
carry
a
revolver
those
fellows
did
look
especially
dainty
did
they
i
ca
believe
that
they
intend
to
murder
you
or
anything
like
that
they
would
dare
do
such
a
that
th
game
savage
i
dead
sure
of
it
this
was
night
an
it
was
to
ha
been
done
in
th
dance
hall
riot
stampede
everybody
fightin
wild
an
then
a
jab
in
th
back
nobody
any
wiser
see
the
two
paled
a
trifle
under
turk
blunt
way
of
putting
it
when
they
entered
the
hotel
a
short
time
later
the
first
man
they
saw
was
prince
ugo
with
his
dark
eyes
glowing
his
lips
parted
in
a
fine
smile
he
came
to
meet
them
his
hand
extended
heartily
i
have
asked
for
you
gentlemen
and
you
were
out
you
return
just
as
i
am
ready
to
give
up
in
despair
and
now
let
me
say
how
happy
i
am
to
see
you
he
said
warmly
the
americans
shook
hands
with
him
confusion
filling
their
brains
why
was
he
not
with
the
garrisons
i
knew
you
were
here
prince
ugo
and
would
have
inquired
for
you
but
that
i
suspected
you
would
be
closely
engaged
said
quentin
after
a
moment
earlier
in
the
evening
i
was
engaged
but
i
am
here
now
as
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
you
quentin
miss
garrison
has
asked
me
to
deliver
into
your
hands
this
with
that
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
sealed
envelope
and
passed
it
to
quentin
i
was
commanded
to
give
it
you
so
perhaps
you
will
read
it
thank
you
muttered
the
other
nervously
tearing
open
the
envelope
as
the
prince
turned
to
dickey
savage
at
that
moment
the
duke
and
the
count
strolled
into
the
rotunda
jauntily
easily
as
if
they
had
been
no
farther
than
the
block
just
beyond
instead
of
racing
about
in
a
bounding
cab
they
approached
the
group
as
phil
turned
away
to
read
the
note
which
had
come
so
strangely
into
his
hands
dorothy
wrote
dear
phil
i
trust
you
to
say
nothing
to
prince
ugo
i
mean
do
not
intimate
that
i
saw
him
yesterday
when
i
went
to
drive
with
you
he
would
consider
it
an
affront
i
know
it
is
not
necessary
to
caution
you
but
i
feel
safe
in
doing
so
you
will
pardon
me
i
am
sure
my
conduct
as
well
as
yours
when
we
look
at
it
calmly
in
an
afterlight
was
quite
extraordinary
so
fully
do
i
trust
him
and
so
well
does
he
love
me
that
i
know
this
note
comes
to
you
inviolate
phil
brain
was
in
a
whirl
he
glanced
at
the
handsome
face
of
dorothy
noble
lover
and
then
at
his
swarthy
fellow
countrymen
could
they
be
plotters
could
he
be
with
those
men
he
had
delivered
the
note
and
yet
he
so
feared
its
recipient
that
he
was
employing
questionable
means
to
dispose
of
him
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
genuineness
of
the
note
it
was
from
dorothy
and
the
prince
had
borne
it
to
him
direct
from
her
hand
an
invitation
to
dinner
asked
the
prince
laughing
easily
miss
garrison
is
alarmingly
fond
of
quentin
and
i
begin
to
feel
the
first
symptoms
of
jealousy
pardon
me
i
should
not
speak
of
her
here
even
in
so
sincere
was
his
manner
that
the
americans
felt
a
strange
respect
for
him
the
same
thought
flashed
through
the
minds
of
both
he
is
not
a
blackguard
whatever
else
he
may
but
up
again
came
the
swift
thought
of
courant
and
his
ugly
companions
and
the
indisputable
evidence
that
the
first
named
at
least
was
a
paid
agent
of
the
man
who
stood
before
them
now
the
prince
once
the
singer
in
far
away
brazil
the
mention
of
dinner
recalls
me
to
affairs
of
my
own
continued
ugo
night
i
expect
a
few
friends
here
to
dine
and
i
have
the
honor
to
ask
you
all
to
be
among
my
guests
we
shall
sit
down
at
nine
and
i
only
exact
a
promise
that
the
end
may
come
within
a
week
the
americans
could
do
naught
but
accept
but
there
was
an
oppressive
sense
of
misgiving
in
their
hearts
mayhap
the
signal
failure
to
carry
out
the
plans
of
one
night
was
leading
swiftly
and
resolutely
up
to
the
success
of
another
for
more
than
an
hour
quentin
and
his
friend
sat
silently
soberly
in
the
former
room
voicing
only
after
long
intervals
the
opinions
and
conjectures
their
puzzled
minds
begot
only
to
sink
back
into
fresh
fields
for
thought
i
ca
understand
it
said
dickey
at
last
starting
to
bed
i
believe
i
understand
it
perfectly
they
are
on
a
new
tack
it
occurs
to
me
that
they
fear
we
suspect
something
and
the
dinner
is
a
sort
of
peace
we
may
be
getting
into
a
nest
of
masculine
lucretia
borgias
my
pleasant
dreams
then
xiv
a
dinner
and
a
duel
at
nine
the
next
evening
quentin
and
savage
found
themselves
in
the
rooms
occupied
by
the
prince
the
former
experiencing
a
distinct
sense
of
wariness
and
caution
if
quentin
suspected
some
form
of
treachery
at
the
outset
he
was
soon
obliged
to
ridicule
his
fears
there
were
nearly
a
score
of
men
there
and
a
single
glance
revealed
to
him
the
gratifying
fact
that
no
treachery
could
be
practiced
in
such
an
assemblage
among
their
fellow
guests
there
was
an
english
lord
an
austrian
duke
a
russian
prince
a
german
baron
besides
others
from
france
belgium
and
germany
prince
ugo
greeted
them
warmly
and
they
were
at
their
ease
in
an
instant
under
the
magnetism
of
his
manner
duke
laselli
and
count
diego
were
more
profuse
in
their
greetings
to
the
young
men
and
it
devolved
upon
the
latter
to
introduce
them
to
the
distinguished
strangers
there
was
but
one
other
american
there
a
millionaire
whose
name
is
a
household
word
in
the
states
and
whose
money
was
at
that
time
just
beginning
to
assert
itself
as
a
menace
to
the
great
commercial
interests
of
the
old
world
he
welcomed
his
fellow
new
yorkers
with
no
small
show
of
delight
the
expression
of
relief
on
his
face
plainly
exposed
a
previous
fear
that
he
was
unspeakably
alone
in
this
assemblage
of
continental
aristocrats
at
the
table
quentin
sat
between
an
austrian
duke
and
a
german
named
von
kragg
he
was
but
two
seats
removed
from
prince
ugo
while
savage
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
almost
opposite
quentin
on
dickey
right
sat
the
duke
laselli
and
next
to
that
individual
was
the
american
millionaire
directly
across
the
broad
table
from
quentin
was
the
tall
count
diego
sallaconi
ob
nobde
gap
sansan
wobble
wibble
raggle
dully
pang
rubby
dub
bob
said
the
baron
in
his
best
french
addressing
the
statuesque
american
with
the
broad
shoulders
and
the
intense
countenance
with
all
my
heart
responded
quentin
with
rare
composure
and
equal
confidence
he
had
no
more
conception
of
what
the
baron
intended
to
say
than
he
would
have
had
if
the
planet
mars
had
wigwagged
a
signal
to
him
but
he
was
polite
enough
to
do
anything
for
the
sake
of
conversation
the
baron
smiled
gladly
even
approvingly
it
was
plain
that
he
understood
phil
english
fully
as
well
as
that
gentleman
understood
his
french
quentin
heard
his
name
uttered
by
prince
ugo
and
turned
from
the
baron
mr
quentin
prince
kapolski
tells
me
he
saw
our
friends
the
saxondales
in
london
last
week
they
were
preparing
to
go
to
their
place
in
the
country
you
have
been
there
have
you
not
prince
ugo
turned
his
gleaming
eyes
and
engaging
smile
upon
the
man
addressed
on
several
occasions
responded
the
other
saxondale
is
a
famous
hunter
and
he
gave
me
some
rare
sport
when
do
they
leave
london
he
asked
indifferently
they
were
to
have
started
this
week
said
the
russian
prince
and
there
is
to
be
quite
a
large
party
i
hear
a
young
american
who
was
with
them
was
called
away
suddenly
last
week
and
as
the
trip
was
arranged
for
his
special
amusement
by
the
lady
jane
i
was
told
his
departure
upset
the
plans
a
quentin
and
savage
who
had
heard
the
remarks
glanced
at
one
another
in
surprise
i
should
enjoy
being
with
them
said
the
former
warmly
my
friend
savage
was
invited
i
think
he
added
and
dickey
studiously
consulted
the
salad
he
had
not
been
invited
and
the
announcement
that
the
saxondales
were
off
for
the
north
of
england
was
news
to
him
oh
certainly
exclaimed
ugo
he
was
their
guest
and
the
lady
jane
arranged
it
you
say
kapolski
draft
horses
could
not
have
been
strong
enough
to
pull
me
away
from
london
had
she
planned
for
my
pleasure
you
must
discover
the
fault
in
him
my
dear
quentin
and
hold
him
to
account
for
a
very
reprehensible
ugo
knew
that
dickey
was
listening
and
the
first
point
in
a
beautiful
game
was
scored
mr
savage
does
not
care
for
shooting
said
phil
flushing
slightly
the
russian
prince
had
been
looking
at
him
intently
a
peculiar
flash
came
into
his
eye
when
quentin
made
the
defensive
remark
but
there
is
game
to
be
had
without
resorting
to
the
gun
he
said
smiling
blandly
one
does
have
to
go
to
a
shooting
box
to
bag
it
though
said
sallaconi
mischievously
i
think
the
hunter
uses
bow
and
arrow
exclusively
added
ugo
and
there
was
a
general
laugh
which
sent
a
streak
of
red
up
cheeks
if
the
russian
news
was
true
he
had
been
purposely
slighted
by
the
saxondales
and
yet
it
was
not
altogether
humiliation
or
wounded
pride
that
brought
the
red
to
his
cheek
he
and
the
lady
jane
had
quarrelled
just
before
he
left
her
and
while
he
hated
her
and
she
hated
him
and
all
that
still
he
did
not
care
to
hear
her
name
bandied
about
by
the
wine
sippers
at
this
delectable
table
what
are
they
talking
about
asked
the
american
millionaire
of
dickey
his
curiosity
aroused
by
the
laughter
of
a
moment
before
about
as
nasty
as
they
can
growled
dickey
that
their
style
you
whew
you
do
have
much
of
an
opinion
of
nobility
beware
of
the
prince
said
the
other
in
a
low
tone
you
could
insult
some
of
them
with
a
deliberate
and
kick
remarked
the
younger
man
sourly
the
duke
laselli
ears
turned
a
shade
pinker
under
his
oily
swarthy
skin
for
the
words
penetrated
them
in
spite
of
the
speaker
caution
a
toast
said
the
russian
prince
arising
from
his
seat
beside
ravorelli
the
guests
arose
and
glasses
almost
met
in
a
long
line
above
the
center
of
the
table
ugo
alone
remained
seated
as
if
divining
that
they
were
to
drink
to
him
for
the
first
time
quentin
closely
observed
the
russian
he
was
tall
and
of
a
powerful
frame
and
the
possessor
of
a
strong
handsome
face
on
which
years
of
dissipation
had
left
few
weakening
marks
his
eyes
were
narrow
and
as
blue
as
the
sky
his
hair
light
and
bushy
his
beard
coarse
and
suggestive
of
the
fierceness
of
the
wild
boar
his
voice
was
clear
and
cutting
and
his
french
almost
perfect
we
drink
to
the
undying
happiness
of
our
host
the
luckiest
prince
in
all
the
world
may
he
always
know
the
bliss
of
a
lover
and
never
the
cares
of
a
husband
may
his
wedded
state
be
an
endless
love
story
without
a
prosaic
passage
may
life
with
the
new
princess
of
ravorelli
be
a
poem
a
song
a
jub
late
with
never
a
dirge
between
its
morn
and
its
and
a
long
life
to
him
added
quentin
clearly
as
they
drank
the
eyes
of
prince
ugo
were
upon
the
last
speaker
and
there
was
a
puzzled
expression
in
them
count
sallaconi
black
eyebrows
shot
up
at
the
outer
ends
and
a
curious
grimness
fastened
itself
about
his
mouth
and
nose
i
thank
you
gentlemen
responded
ugo
arising
will
you
divide
the
toast
with
me
in
proposing
the
happiness
of
the
one
who
is
to
bring
all
these
good
things
into
my
life
the
glasses
were
drained
dickey
savage
eyes
met
quentin
in
a
long
look
of
perplexity
at
last
an
almost
imperceptible
twinkle
suggestive
of
either
mirth
or
skepticism
manifested
itself
in
his
friend
eyes
and
the
puzzled
observer
was
satisfied
when
in
the
end
the
diners
pushed
their
chairs
back
from
the
table
and
passed
into
another
room
it
was
far
past
midnight
and
the
real
revelry
of
the
night
was
at
hand
reckless
voluptuous
women
from
the
vaudeville
houses
and
dance
halls
appeared
and
for
hours
the
scions
of
nobility
reeked
in
those
exhibitions
which
shock
the
sensibilities
of
true
men
four
men
there
were
who
tried
to
conceal
their
disgust
while
the
others
roared
out
the
applause
of
degenerates
i
am
not
a
saint
but
this
is
more
than
i
can
stand
it
is
sickening
said
quentin
and
these
miserable
specimens
of
european
manhood
delight
in
it
said
savage
his
face
aflame
with
shame
and
disgust
it
is
too
vile
for
a
man
who
has
a
breath
of
manhood
in
him
to
encourage
and
yet
these
bounders
go
crazy
with
rapture
gad
do
ask
what
kind
of
women
they
are
ask
how
it
is
the
world
has
ever
called
these
fellows
did
i
understand
you
correctly
sir
asked
a
cold
voice
at
his
side
and
dickey
turned
to
look
into
the
flaming
eyes
of
prince
kapolski
count
sallaconi
was
clutching
the
left
arm
of
the
big
russian
and
there
was
a
look
of
dismay
in
his
face
he
flashed
a
glance
of
fierce
disappointment
at
quentin
and
then
one
of
helplessness
across
the
room
at
prince
ugo
if
you
understand
english
you
probably
did
said
dickey
pale
but
defiant
come
prince
began
the
agitated
count
but
kapolski
shook
him
off
you
must
apologize
for
your
comments
sir
said
the
prince
in
excellent
english
i
ca
apologize
you
know
i
meant
what
i
said
said
dickey
drawing
himself
up
to
the
limit
of
his
five
feet
ten
the
open
hand
came
violently
in
contact
with
the
young
fellow
cheek
driving
the
tears
to
the
surface
of
his
eyes
they
were
tears
of
anger
pain
and
mortification
not
of
submission
or
fear
his
clenched
right
hand
shot
outward
and
upward
and
before
the
russian
knew
what
had
happened
a
crashing
blow
caught
him
full
in
the
jaw
and
he
would
have
gone
sprawling
to
the
floor
had
not
diego
sallaconi
caught
him
in
his
arms
quentin
grasped
dickey
and
pulled
him
away
while
others
rushed
in
and
held
the
roaring
sputtering
victim
all
was
confusion
and
excitement
in
an
instant
quentin
and
the
millionaire
drew
their
lithe
countryman
away
from
the
gathering
crowd
one
cheek
white
as
a
sheet
the
other
a
bright
pink
and
phil
hoarsely
whispered
to
him
i
do
know
what
we
in
for
dickey
so
for
heaven
sake
get
out
of
here
we
do
want
any
more
of
it
you
gave
him
a
good
punch
and
that
you
broke
up
the
show
all
right
enough
exclaimed
the
millionaire
excitedly
the
fairies
ran
over
each
other
trying
to
get
out
of
the
room
you
as
game
as
a
fighting
cock
let
me
alone
phil
panted
dickey
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
run
from
that
big
duffer
do
you
let
go
do
be
a
fool
dickey
said
his
friend
earnestly
just
then
a
waiter
came
up
from
behind
and
hoarsely
whispered
in
quentin
ear
get
out
quick
the
big
prince
made
a
mistake
he
was
to
have
quarrelled
with
you
he
was
gone
before
he
could
be
questioned
see
exclaimed
dickey
it
was
a
job
after
all
and
the
dago
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
sh
here
he
comes
with
the
russian
and
the
whole
pack
behind
them
it
too
late
we
ca
run
now
said
phil
despairingly
as
ugo
and
kapolski
crossed
the
room
the
former
whose
face
was
white
with
suppressed
passion
hissed
under
his
breath
into
the
ear
of
the
raging
russian
you
fool
it
was
the
other
one
the
tall
one
you
have
quarrelled
with
the
wrong
man
the
big
one
is
quentin
kapolski
how
could
you
have
made
such
a
mistake
mistake
or
no
mistake
he
has
struck
me
and
he
shall
pay
for
it
the
other
can
come
later
growled
the
russian
savagely
gentlemen
this
is
no
place
to
fight
let
us
have
explanations
began
ugo
addressing
quentin
more
than
savage
but
the
latter
interrupted
call
off
your
dogs
and
we
will
talk
it
over
he
said
dickey
cautioned
his
friend
i
do
not
understand
you
savage
my
dogs
oh
i
see
quentin
he
is
mad
with
anger
said
the
prince
deprecatingly
there
can
be
no
explanations
snarled
kapolski
my
card
monsieur
and
he
threw
the
pasteboard
in
the
young
american
face
damn
your
impudence
exploded
quentin
now
ready
to
take
the
fight
off
the
hands
of
the
one
on
whom
it
had
been
forced
through
error
you
ought
to
be
kicked
downstairs
for
you
will
have
that
to
recall
monsieur
but
not
until
after
i
have
disposed
of
your
valiant
friend
exclaimed
kapolski
we
are
not
in
the
habit
of
waiting
for
a
chance
to
dispose
of
such
affairs
said
quentin
coolly
we
fight
when
we
have
a
cause
and
on
the
do
you
expect
civilized
men
to
carry
arms
into
sneered
kapolski
ugo
face
was
lighting
up
with
pleasure
and
satisfaction
and
sallaconi
was
breathing
easier
i
speaking
of
hands
not
arms
said
phil
glaring
at
the
other
i
fight
him
in
a
second
cried
dickey
gentlemen
gentlemen
be
calm
let
this
affair
be
arranged
by
your
seconds
and
in
the
regular
manner
expostulated
ugo
this
is
very
unusual
and
i
must
beg
of
you
to
remember
that
you
are
in
my
that
is
the
rub
prince
ravorelli
it
has
happened
in
your
rooms
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
if
evil
befalls
my
friend
i
shall
hold
you
to
account
for
it
said
quentin
turning
on
him
suddenly
what
do
you
mean
sir
you
know
what
i
mean
i
can
and
am
ready
to
fight
my
own
this
outrageous
brawl
is
none
of
my
affair
quentin
and
i
do
not
like
your
threat
you
and
i
should
do
all
in
our
power
to
prevent
it
from
going
farther
your
friend
was
too
free
with
his
words
i
am
told
if
he
did
not
like
my
entertainment
he
should
have
left
the
well
i
did
like
it
if
you
want
to
know
said
dickey
and
i
do
care
a
continental
who
heard
what
i
does
he
still
want
to
fight
with
his
hands
demanded
kapolski
now
cool
and
ironical
there
was
an
infuriating
attempt
on
his
part
to
speak
as
if
he
were
addressing
a
small
pouting
child
anything
anything
the
only
point
is
you
have
to
fight
right
now
i
two
or
three
friends
here
who
see
that
i
get
fair
said
dickey
discretion
flying
to
the
wind
you
shall
fight
and
here
exclaimed
the
russian
but
you
shall
fight
like
a
gentleman
for
once
in
your
life
i
will
not
claw
and
scratch
with
you
like
the
women
do
but
with
any
weapon
you
dickey
valor
did
not
fade
but
his
discretion
came
to
the
surface
with
a
suddenness
that
took
his
breath
away
he
turned
to
speak
to
quentin
and
the
millionaire
phil
face
was
deathly
white
and
there
was
a
pleading
look
in
his
eyes
the
millionaire
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
i
guess
i
take
pistols
said
dickey
slowly
i
ca
hit
the
side
of
a
barn
but
he
ca
bluff
me
damn
great
scott
dickey
do
do
it
do
do
it
whispered
quentin
this
is
my
fight
you
know
it
is
and
i
wo
let
you
you
ca
help
it
old
boy
he
probably
get
me
but
i
may
be
lucky
enough
to
have
a
bullet
land
in
him
my
only
chance
is
to
aim
anywhere
but
at
him
shut
my
eyes
and
trust
to
then
turning
to
kapolski
he
said
deliberately
pistols
and
here
if
the
prince
does
not
can
not
this
affair
be
postponed
began
ugo
desperately
not
unless
your
friend
forgets
that
i
punched
his
head
it
is
now
or
never
with
me
said
dickey
i
insist
that
it
is
my
right
to
fight
this
man
exclaimed
quentin
standing
forth
i
first
expressed
the
opinion
which
savage
merely
echoed
and
to
which
prince
kapolski
took
but
you
did
not
strike
me
in
any
event
you
shall
come
next
quentin
i
shall
take
you
on
immediately
after
i
have
disposed
of
your
cockadoodle
friend
said
kapolski
throwing
aside
his
coat
you
have
pistols
here
prince
ravorelli
this
is
murder
cried
the
millionaire
and
i
shall
take
it
before
the
united
states
dickey
dickey
cried
phil
helplessly
as
savage
began
to
remove
his
coat
i
have
weapons
if
you
insist
gentlemen
said
ugo
at
his
words
intense
excitement
prevailed
for
now
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
result
of
the
quarrel
count
sallaconi
hurried
away
for
the
pistols
smiling
significantly
as
he
passed
his
prince
his
smile
said
that
kapolski
would
kill
two
men
that
night
for
god
sake
dickey
be
careful
if
you
must
fight
take
deliberate
aim
and
do
lose
your
nerve
cried
quentin
grasping
him
by
the
arms
you
are
as
cold
as
i
have
fired
a
pistol
more
than
a
dozen
times
in
my
life
said
dickey
smiling
faintly
then
shoot
low
said
the
millionaire
your
second
monsieur
said
the
austrian
duke
coming
to
side
mr
quentin
will
act
monsieur
le
duc
we
may
need
a
dr
gassbeck
is
it
was
hurriedly
agreed
that
the
men
should
stand
at
opposite
ends
of
the
room
nearly
twenty
feet
apart
back
to
back
at
the
word
given
by
prince
ugo
they
were
to
turn
and
fire
sallaconi
came
in
with
the
pistol
case
and
the
seconds
examined
the
weapons
carefully
a
moment
later
the
room
was
cleared
except
for
the
adversaries
the
seconds
and
prince
ugo
there
was
the
stillness
of
death
on
the
face
of
the
russian
there
was
an
easy
smile
for
was
not
he
a
noted
shot
had
he
ever
missed
an
adversary
in
a
duel
dickey
was
pale
but
he
did
not
tremble
as
he
took
the
pistol
in
his
hand
phil
was
all
he
said
poor
quentin
turned
his
face
away
as
he
clasped
his
hand
and
he
could
only
murmur
if
he
hits
you
i
kill
a
moment
later
the
word
fire
came
and
the
two
men
whirled
into
position
dickey
arm
went
up
like
a
flash
the
other
more
cruelly
deliberate
two
loud
reports
followed
in
quick
succession
the
slim
american
nervous
finger
pressed
the
trigger
first
he
had
not
taken
aim
he
had
located
his
man
position
before
turning
away
and
the
whole
force
of
his
will
was
bent
on
driving
the
bullet
directly
toward
the
spot
he
had
in
mind
kapolski
bullet
struck
the
wall
above
dickey
head
his
deadly
aim
spoiled
by
the
quick
reckless
shot
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
lunged
forward
dickey
bullet
had
blown
away
part
of
the
big
russian
chin
and
jaw
burying
itself
in
the
wall
beyond
xv
approach
of
the
crisis
prince
ugo
face
was
livid
and
his
black
eyes
bulged
with
horrified
amazement
the
unscrupulous
daring
infallible
duelist
whom
he
had
induced
to
try
conclusions
with
quentin
in
a
regular
and
effective
way
had
been
overthrown
at
the
outset
by
a
most
peculiar
transaction
of
fate
he
had
assured
the
russian
that
quentin
was
no
match
for
him
with
the
weapons
common
to
dueling
and
he
had
led
him
to
believe
that
he
was
in
little
danger
of
injury
much
less
death
kapolski
reckless
a
despiser
of
all
things
american
eagerly
consented
to
the
plan
and
ugo
saw
a
way
to
rid
himself
of
a
dangerous
rival
without
the
taint
of
suspicion
besmirching
his
cloak
sallaconi
was
an
accomplished
swordsman
but
it
would
have
been
unwise
to
send
him
against
quentin
ugo
himself
was
a
splendid
shot
and
an
expert
with
the
blade
and
it
was
not
cowardice
that
kept
him
from
taking
the
affair
in
his
own
hands
it
was
wisdom
cunning
wisdom
that
urged
him
to
stand
aloof
and
to
go
up
to
his
wedding
day
with
no
scandal
at
his
back
but
the
unexpected
the
miraculous
had
happened
his
friend
his
brother
prince
his
unwitting
tool
had
gone
down
like
a
log
his
vaunted
skill
surpassed
by
the
marksmanship
and
courage
of
an
accursed
american
to
his
credit
be
it
said
that
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
preserve
the
life
of
prince
kapolski
more
than
that
he
did
all
that
was
possible
to
keep
the
story
of
the
encounter
from
reaching
the
world
so
powerful
so
successful
was
his
influence
that
the
world
at
large
knew
nothing
of
the
fight
the
police
were
bribed
and
the
newspapers
were
thrown
completely
off
the
scent
ugo
first
thought
after
the
fall
of
kapolski
was
to
prevent
his
opponent
from
leaving
the
room
alive
but
common
sense
came
to
his
relief
a
second
later
and
he
saw
the
folly
of
taking
a
stand
against
the
victor
he
rushed
to
kapolski
side
and
helped
to
support
the
moaning
man
body
the
surgeon
was
there
an
instant
later
and
dickey
as
white
as
a
ghost
started
mechanically
toward
the
fallen
foe
ouentin
stood
like
a
man
of
stone
stunned
by
relief
and
surprise
one
glance
at
the
bloody
lacerated
face
and
the
rolling
eyes
caused
savage
to
flee
as
if
pursued
by
devils
for
hours
quentin
and
turk
sought
to
comfort
and
to
quiet
him
the
millionaire
who
refused
to
desert
them
sat
up
all
night
to
manage
the
information
bureau
as
he
called
it
he
personally
inquired
at
ugo
rooms
and
always
brought
back
reassuring
news
which
quentin
doubted
and
dickey
utterly
disbelieved
at
four
prince
ugo
himself
with
duke
laselli
came
to
quentin
rooms
with
the
word
that
kapolski
was
to
be
taken
to
a
hospital
and
that
gassbeck
pronounced
his
chance
for
recovery
excellent
the
prince
assured
savage
that
secrecy
would
be
preserved
but
advised
him
to
leave
brussels
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
kapolski
death
if
it
came
would
command
an
investigation
and
it
would
be
better
if
he
were
where
the
law
could
not
find
him
quentin
with
difficulty
restrained
from
openly
accusing
the
prince
of
duplicity
afterthought
told
him
how
impotent
his
accusation
would
have
been
for
how
could
he
prove
that
the
russian
was
acting
as
an
agent
just
before
daylight
turk
saw
them
take
prince
kapolski
from
the
hotel
in
an
ambulance
and
considering
it
his
duty
promptly
followed
in
a
cab
the
destination
of
the
ambulance
was
the
side
street
entrance
to
one
of
the
big
hospitals
in
the
upper
part
of
the
town
and
the
men
who
accompanied
the
prince
were
strangers
to
the
little
observer
prince
ugo
was
not
of
the
party
nor
were
laselli
and
sallaconi
on
his
return
to
the
bellevue
he
had
a
fresh
task
on
his
hands
he
was
obliged
to
carry
a
man
from
quentin
apartments
and
put
him
to
bed
in
the
millionaire
room
farther
down
the
hall
the
millionaire
for
it
was
he
slept
all
day
and
had
a
headache
until
the
thirtieth
of
the
month
turk
put
him
to
bed
on
the
during
the
forenoon
prince
ugo
and
count
sallaconi
called
at
quentin
rooms
they
found
that
gentleman
and
savage
dressed
and
ready
for
the
street
good
morning
said
dickey
pleasantly
for
the
two
americans
had
determined
to
suppress
for
diplomatic
reasons
any
show
of
hostility
toward
the
italians
the
visitors
may
not
have
exposed
their
true
feelings
but
they
were
very
much
astounded
and
not
a
little
shocked
to
find
the
duelist
and
his
friend
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
how
did
you
sleep
asked
ugo
after
he
had
expressed
his
sorrow
over
the
little
unpleasantry
of
the
night
before
deploring
the
tragic
ending
to
the
night
of
pleasure
like
a
top
lied
dickey
cheerfully
i
was
afraid
the
excitement
might
have
caused
you
great
uneasiness
and
ah
dread
said
the
prince
the
count
was
industriously
engaged
in
piercing
with
his
glittering
eyes
the
tapestry
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
savage
possessed
the
manner
of
a
man
who
shoots
someone
every
morning
before
breakfast
not
in
the
least
did
it
quentin
he
slept
like
a
by
the
way
before
i
forget
it
prince
ugo
how
is
the
gentleman
i
shot
last
night
ah
what
was
his
name
asked
dickey
slapping
his
leg
carelessly
with
his
walking
stick
prince
kapolski
is
in
the
hospital
and
i
fear
he
can
not
recover
said
the
prince
i
came
to
tell
you
this
that
you
may
act
accordingly
and
with
all
the
haste
o
i
do
know
why
i
should
run
away
everybody
there
will
testify
that
the
fight
was
forced
upon
me
you
will
swear
to
that
yourself
prince
ugo
and
so
will
the
count
i
had
to
fight
you
it
seems
to
me
savage
that
you
were
rather
eager
to
fight
i
can
not
vouch
for
your
safety
if
the
prince
dies
said
ugo
coolly
but
he
is
going
to
die
i
did
not
shoot
to
kill
and
the
ball
hit
him
just
where
i
intended
it
should
on
the
chin
he
be
well
in
a
couple
of
weeks
true
he
may
not
feel
like
eating
tough
beefsteak
with
that
jaw
for
some
time
but
i
knew
a
fellow
once
who
was
able
to
eat
very
comfortably
after
six
weeks
that
was
as
good
a
shot
as
i
ever
made
phil
said
dickey
reflectively
i
think
buckner
nose
was
a
cleaner
shot
it
was
nearly
so
disgusting
said
phil
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
able
to
hit
a
man
just
where
you
please
demanded
the
count
provided
he
does
not
hit
me
first
said
savage
gentlemen
let
me
order
up
a
quiet
little
drink
i
am
afraid
the
unfortunate
affair
of
last
night
has
twisted
your
nerves
a
bit
it
was
rather
ghastly
was
it
when
the
four
parted
company
in
front
of
the
hotel
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
two
italians
sat
down
to
reflect
they
wondered
whether
savage
usually
carried
a
pistol
in
his
pocket
and
they
agreed
that
if
he
did
have
one
of
his
own
he
would
be
much
more
accurate
with
it
than
with
a
strange
one
such
as
he
had
used
the
night
before
the
two
americans
were
not
jubilant
as
they
strolled
up
the
street
they
had
put
on
a
very
bold
front
but
they
were
saying
to
themselves
that
kapolski
death
would
be
a
very
disastrous
calamity
cold
perspiration
stood
on
dickey
brow
and
he
devoutly
prayed
that
his
victim
would
recover
i
feel
like
a
butcher
to
the
last
day
of
my
life
he
groaned
the
big
brute
got
what
he
deserved
dickey
but
that
is
going
to
relieve
us
if
he
should
die
prince
ugo
would
use
it
as
an
excuse
to
drive
you
out
of
europe
and
of
course
i
would
not
desert
you
it
was
my
affair
and
you
were
unlucky
enough
to
get
into
it
there
is
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
i
directly
insulted
ravorelli
last
night
why
does
he
not
challenge
me
he
must
be
positive
that
i
recognize
him
as
pavesi
and
can
ruin
him
with
a
word
i
am
told
he
is
a
remarkable
shot
and
swordsman
and
i
do
believe
he
is
a
why
should
he
risk
his
head
or
his
heart
if
he
can
induce
other
men
to
fight
for
him
but
it
seems
that
he
has
traitors
in
his
camp
i
wonder
who
that
waiter
was
after
a
long
silence
dickey
dolefully
asked
say
do
you
believe
the
saxondales
turned
me
down
on
that
shooting
box
party
i
ca
believe
it
all
is
well
between
you
and
lady
jane
of
course
as
well
as
it
can
ever
be
said
the
other
looking
straight
ahead
his
jaws
set
oho
is
it
all
off
is
what
all
off
belligerently
o
if
you
do
know
i
wo
insist
on
an
answer
i
merely
suspected
a
that
we
were
getting
thick
you
mean
you
were
never
more
mistaken
in
your
life
the
chances
are
i
never
see
her
again
that
not
very
thick
is
it
i
saw
a
letter
just
now
for
you
in
my
box
at
the
hotel
looked
like
a
young
woman
chirography
and
it
was
from
london
why
the
devil
did
you
tell
me
it
was
there
exploded
dickey
does
lady
jane
make
an
r
that
looks
like
a
streak
of
lightning
with
all
sorts
of
angles
she
makes
a
very
fashionable
what
do
you
mean
by
inspecting
my
mail
are
you
establishing
a
censorship
dickey
was
guilty
of
an
unheard
of
act
for
him
he
was
blushing
my
boy
i
did
not
know
it
was
your
property
until
after
i
had
carefully
deciphered
every
letter
in
the
name
i
agree
with
you
she
writes
a
very
fashionable
alphabet
the
envelope
looked
thick
to
say
the
least
it
must
contain
a
huge
or
a
collection
of
all
the
notes
i
have
written
to
her
i
go
back
if
you
do
mind
however
i
curious
to
know
who
dickey
went
back
to
read
his
voluminous
letter
and
quentin
seated
himself
on
a
bench
in
the
park
a
voice
from
behind
brought
him
sharply
from
a
long
reverie
mr
quentin
last
night
possibly
in
the
heat
of
excitement
you
inferred
that
i
was
in
some
way
accountable
for
the
controversy
which
led
to
the
meeting
between
prince
kapolski
and
your
friend
i
trust
that
i
misunderstood
quentin
was
on
his
feet
and
facing
prince
ravorelli
before
the
remark
was
fairly
begun
and
he
was
thinking
with
greater
rapidity
than
he
had
ever
thought
before
he
was
surprised
to
find
ugo
suave
and
polite
as
ever
deliberately
coolly
rushing
affairs
to
a
climax
his
sudden
decision
to
abandon
the
friendly
spirit
exhibited
but
half
an
hour
before
was
as
inexplicable
as
it
was
critical
what
fresh
inspiration
had
caused
him
to
alter
his
position
we
say
many
things
when
we
are
under
stress
of
excitement
said
phil
sparring
for
time
and
his
wits
count
sallaconi
was
standing
deferentially
beside
the
prince
both
gentlemen
had
their
hats
in
their
hands
and
the
air
was
pregnant
with
chill
formality
can
you
recall
my
words
prince
ravorelli
you
said
that
you
would
hold
him
to
account
if
your
friend
began
the
count
but
quentin
turned
upon
him
coolly
my
quarrel
if
there
is
one
is
with
the
prince
count
sallaconi
will
you
kindly
allow
him
to
jog
his
own
memory
i
do
not
like
your
tone
quentin
said
the
count
his
eyes
flashingly
angrily
phil
blood
was
up
he
saw
it
was
useless
to
temporize
and
there
was
no
necessity
for
disguising
his
true
feelings
they
had
come
to
the
point
where
all
that
had
lain
smothered
and
dormant
was
to
be
pricked
into
activity
the
mask
was
to
be
thrown
down
with
the
gauntlet
so
much
the
better
you
are
not
in
doubt
as
to
what
i
meant
now
prince
ravorelli
may
i
ask
you
to
speak
plainly
your
remark
of
last
night
was
one
that
i
believe
i
would
be
justified
in
resenting
said
the
prince
flicking
the
ash
from
his
cigarette
but
not
taking
his
burning
eyes
from
quentin
face
there
was
not
a
tinge
of
cowardice
in
his
eyes
it
is
your
privilege
sir
and
i
meant
precisely
what
i
then
i
have
to
demand
of
you
an
apology
and
a
satisfctory
presume
it
would
be
travesty
on
politeness
if
i
were
to
ask
you
to
be
seated
so
we
may
stand
up
to
each
other
and
talk
it
over
in
the
first
place
i
have
no
apology
to
make
in
the
second
place
i
can
not
give
an
explanation
that
would
be
satisfactory
to
you
last
night
i
said
i
would
hold
you
to
account
if
savage
was
hurt
he
was
not
hurt
so
i
will
not
carry
out
my
threat
if
you
choose
to
call
it
you
enlarge
the
insult
quentin
said
ugo
with
a
deadly
tone
in
his
voice
you
may
as
well
know
prince
ravorelli
that
i
have
long
been
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
you
bear
me
no
good
will
frankly
you
regard
me
as
a
man
dangerous
to
your
most
cherished
aspirations
and
you
know
that
i
heard
giovanni
pavesi
sing
in
days
gone
by
you
have
not
been
manly
enough
to
meet
me
fairly
up
to
this
instant
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
that
prince
kapolski
was
your
guest
last
night
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
bring
about
an
affray
in
which
i
was
to
have
been
the
victim
of
his
prowess
and
your
for
a
moment
the
two
men
glared
at
each
other
immovably
unwaveringly
prince
ugo
composure
did
not
suffer
the
faintest
relaxation
under
the
direct
charge
of
the
american
my
only
reply
to
that
assertion
is
that
you
lie
he
said
slowly
this
is
a
public
place
prince
ugo
i
will
not
knock
you
down
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
give
you
my
card
count
sallaconi
will
arrange
the
details
with
any
friend
you
may
name
you
shall
give
me
satisfaction
for
the
aspersion
you
have
cast
upon
my
he
was
turning
away
when
quentin
stepped
quickly
in
front
of
him
if
you
mean
that
you
expect
me
to
fight
a
duel
with
you
i
must
say
you
are
to
suffer
disappointment
i
do
not
believe
in
duelling
and
i
believe
only
in
killing
a
man
when
there
is
no
other
alternative
to
deliberately
set
about
to
shoot
another
man
down
is
not
our
method
of
settling
an
issue
we
either
murder
in
cold
blood
or
we
fight
it
out
like
men
not
like
stage
i
will
add
then
sir
that
you
are
a
i
have
been
brave
enough
to
refrain
from
hiring
men
to
do
my
fighting
we
will
fight
prince
ravorelli
but
we
will
not
fight
with
weapons
made
by
man
you
call
me
a
coward
and
i
call
you
a
scoundrel
we
have
hands
and
arms
and
with
them
we
shall
count
sallaconi
is
my
second
i
do
not
care
to
hear
another
word
if
count
sallaconi
comes
to
me
with
any
ridiculous
challenge
from
you
i
knock
him
down
and
kick
him
across
the
street
my
friend
shot
the
face
off
of
your
poor
tool
last
night
i
do
not
care
to
repeat
the
tragedy
i
shall
not
strike
you
here
and
now
because
the
act
might
mean
my
arrest
and
detention
on
no
one
knows
what
sort
of
a
charge
you
need
not
bother
me
with
any
silly
twaddle
about
swords
and
pistols
i
shall
pay
no
attention
to
it
ordinarily
americans
do
not
delay
actual
combat
we
usually
fight
it
out
on
the
spot
and
the
best
man
wins
i
will
however
give
you
the
chance
to
deliberate
over
my
proposition
to
settle
our
differences
with
our
ravorelli
calmly
heard
him
to
the
end
then
he
turned
and
strode
away
smiling
derisively
you
are
the
only
american
coward
i
have
ever
seen
i
trust
you
appreciate
the
distinction
he
said
his
white
teeth
showing
in
malicious
ridicule
your
friend
the
hero
of
last
night
should
be
proud
of
quentin
watched
them
until
they
were
lost
in
the
crowd
near
the
palace
his
brain
full
of
many
emotions
as
he
walked
into
the
hotel
his
only
thought
was
of
dorothy
and
the
effect
the
quarrel
would
have
on
their
friendship
which
will
she
choose
he
mused
after
narrating
to
savage
the
episode
of
the
park
for
the
first
time
dickey
noticed
the
pallor
in
his
face
the
despair
in
his
eyes
the
wistful
lines
about
his
lips
there
only
one
way
to
find
out
old
man
said
he
and
he
did
not
succeed
in
disguising
the
hopelessness
in
his
voice
yes
i
guess
i
up
to
the
last
trench
i
right
where
i
have
to
make
the
final
stand
let
the
result
be
what
it
may
said
the
other
dejectedly
do
give
up
phil
if
you
are
to
win
it
will
take
more
courage
than
you
are
showing
now
a
bold
front
will
do
more
than
anything
else
just
at
this
stage
the
result
depends
not
entirely
on
how
eager
she
is
to
become
a
princess
but
how
much
she
cares
for
the
man
who
can
not
make
her
a
there
the
rub
does
she
care
enough
for
me
have
you
asked
her
how
much
she
cares
then
do
ask
merely
go
and
tell
her
that
you
know
how
much
she
cares
go
this
afternoon
old
man
o
by
the
way
lady
jane
sends
her
love
to
you
and
wants
to
know
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
ostend
to
meet
her
and
lady
xvi
the
courage
of
a
coward
tell
quentin
i
can
not
see
him
was
miss
garrison
response
when
his
card
was
sent
to
her
late
that
afternoon
the
man
who
waited
nervously
in
the
hall
was
stunned
by
this
brief
summary
dismissal
if
he
was
hurt
bewildered
by
the
stinging
rebuff
his
wounds
would
have
been
healed
instantly
had
he
seen
the
sender
of
that
cruel
message
she
sat
weak
pale
and
distressed
before
her
escritoire
striving
to
put
her
mind
and
her
heart
to
the
note
she
was
writing
to
him
whose
card
by
strange
coincidence
had
just
come
up
an
hour
ago
he
was
in
her
thoughts
so
differently
and
he
was
in
her
heart
how
deeply
she
had
not
realized
until
there
came
the
crash
which
shattered
the
ideal
he
was
a
coward
prince
ugo
had
been
out
of
her
presence
not
more
than
ten
minutes
leaving
her
stunned
horrified
crushed
by
the
story
he
laughingly
told
when
quentin
was
announced
what
she
heard
from
ugo
overwhelmed
her
she
had
worshiped
unknown
to
herself
the
very
thing
in
philip
quentin
that
had
been
destroyed
almost
before
her
eyes
his
manliness
his
courage
his
strength
ugo
deliberately
told
of
the
duel
in
his
rooms
of
savage
heroism
in
taking
up
the
battles
of
his
timorous
friend
of
his
own
challenge
in
the
morning
and
of
quentin
abject
cringing
refusal
to
fight
how
deliciously
he
painted
the
portrait
of
the
coward
without
exposing
his
true
motive
in
doing
so
can
only
be
appreciated
when
it
is
said
that
dorothy
garrison
came
to
despise
the
object
of
his
ridicule
she
forgot
his
encounter
with
the
porch
visitor
a
fortnight
previous
she
forgot
that
the
wound
inflicted
on
that
occasion
was
scarcely
healed
she
forgot
all
but
his
disgraceful
behavior
in
the
presence
of
that
company
of
nobles
and
his
cowardice
when
called
to
account
by
one
brave
man
and
he
an
american
a
man
from
her
own
land
from
the
side
of
the
world
on
which
she
had
boasted
there
lived
none
but
the
valorous
this
man
was
the
one
to
whom
a
week
ago
she
had
personally
addressed
an
invitation
to
the
wedding
in
gudule
the
envelope
was
doubtless
in
his
pocket
now
perhaps
above
his
heart
and
the
writing
of
his
name
at
that
time
had
brought
to
her
the
deadly
sinking
realization
that
he
was
more
to
her
than
she
had
thought
tell
miss
garrison
that
if
it
is
at
all
possible
i
must
see
her
at
once
said
quentin
to
the
bearer
of
the
message
he
was
cold
with
apprehension
hot
with
humiliation
miss
garrison
can
not
see
you
said
the
man
returning
from
his
second
visit
to
the
room
above
even
the
servant
spoke
with
a
curtness
that
could
not
be
mistaken
it
meant
dismissal
cold
and
decisive
with
no
explanation
no
excuse
he
left
the
house
with
his
ears
burning
his
nerves
tingling
his
brain
whirling
what
had
caused
this
astonishing
change
why
had
she
turned
against
him
so
suddenly
so
strangely
prince
ugo
the
truth
flashed
into
his
mind
with
startling
force
dispelling
all
uncertainty
all
doubt
her
lover
had
forstalled
him
had
requested
or
demanded
his
banishment
and
she
had
acquiesced
with
a
heartlessness
that
was
beyond
belief
he
had
been
mistaken
as
to
the
extent
of
her
regard
for
him
he
had
misjudged
the
progress
of
his
wooing
he
awoke
to
the
truth
that
her
heart
was
impregnable
and
that
he
had
not
so
much
as
approached
the
citadel
of
her
love
dickey
was
pacing
their
rooms
excitedly
when
quentin
entered
turk
stared
gloomily
from
the
open
window
and
there
was
a
sort
of
savageness
in
his
silent
sturdy
back
that
bespoke
volumes
of
restraint
good
lord
phil
everybody
knows
you
have
refused
to
fight
the
prince
the
newspaper
men
have
been
here
and
they
have
tried
to
pump
me
dry
turk
says
one
of
the
men
downstairs
is
telling
everybody
that
you
are
afraid
of
ravorelli
what
are
we
going
to
do
he
stopped
before
the
newcomer
and
there
was
reproach
in
his
manner
quentin
dejectedly
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
stared
at
the
floor
in
silence
turk
he
called
at
last
i
want
you
to
carry
a
note
to
miss
garrison
and
i
want
you
to
make
sure
that
she
reads
it
i
know
how
the
devil
you
are
to
do
it
but
you
must
do
bother
me
dickey
i
do
care
a
continental
what
the
fellow
downstairs
says
i
got
something
else
to
think
he
threw
open
the
lid
to
one
of
his
trunks
and
ruthlessly
grabbed
up
some
stationery
in
a
minute
he
was
at
the
table
writing
is
kapolski
dead
asked
dickey
i
do
know
and
do
care
i
explain
in
a
minute
sit
down
somewhere
and
do
stare
dickey
for
the
lord
sake
do
stare
like
a
scared
he
completed
the
feverishly
written
note
sealed
the
envelope
and
thrust
it
into
turk
hands
now
get
that
note
to
her
or
do
come
back
to
me
be
quick
about
it
turk
was
off
full
of
fresh
wonder
and
the
importance
of
his
mission
quentin
took
a
few
turns
up
and
down
the
room
before
he
remembered
that
he
owed
some
sort
of
an
explanation
to
his
companion
she
would
see
me
he
said
briefly
what
the
matter
sick
no
explanation
just
would
see
me
that
which
means
it
all
off
eh
the
prince
got
there
first
and
spiked
your
guns
well
what
have
you
written
to
her
that
i
am
going
to
see
her
if
i
have
to
break
into
the
bravely
done
good
and
you
awake
in
a
dungeon
cell
morning
clubbed
to
a
pulp
by
the
police
you
may
break
into
the
house
but
it
will
be
just
your
luck
to
be
unable
to
break
out
of
jail
in
time
for
the
wedding
on
the
what
you
need
is
a
i
in
no
humor
for
joking
it
wo
be
a
joke
my
boy
now
tell
me
just
what
you
wrote
to
her
gad
i
never
knew
what
trouble
meant
until
i
struck
brussels
the
hot
water
here
is
scalding
me
to
a
creamy
i
simply
said
that
she
had
no
right
to
treat
me
as
she
did
and
that
she
shall
listen
to
me
i
ended
the
note
by
saying
i
would
come
to
her
and
that
i
would
not
be
driven
away
until
i
had
seen
you
ca
see
her
if
she
refuses
to
receive
but
she
will
see
me
she
fair
enough
to
give
me
a
do
you
want
me
to
accompany
you
i
intend
to
go
you
will
find
ugo
there
you
know
it
is
bound
to
be
rather
trying
phil
besides
you
are
not
sure
that
turk
can
deliver
the
i
like
to
have
ravorelli
hear
everything
i
have
to
say
to
her
and
if
he
there
he
hear
a
few
things
he
will
not
and
he
laugh
at
you
an
hour
later
turk
returned
he
was
grinning
broadly
as
he
entered
the
room
did
you
succeed
demanded
quentin
leaping
to
his
feet
for
answer
the
little
man
daintily
gingerly
dropped
a
small
envelope
into
his
hand
she
says
to
give
th
note
to
you
an
to
nobody
else
he
said
triumphantly
quentin
hesitated
an
instant
before
tearing
open
the
envelope
the
contents
of
which
meant
so
much
to
him
as
he
read
the
gloom
lifted
from
his
face
and
his
figure
straightened
to
its
full
height
the
old
light
came
back
to
his
eyes
she
says
i
may
come
dickey
i
knew
she
would
he
exclaimed
joyously
when
at
nine
is
that
all
she
says
well
er
no
she
says
she
will
see
me
for
the
last
not
very
comforting
i
should
i
risk
it
being
the
last
time
i
tell
you
savage
desperate
this
damnable
game
has
gone
far
enough
she
know
the
truth
about
the
man
she
going
to
marry
if
she
wants
to
marry
him
after
what
i
tell
her
i
i
well
i
give
it
up
if
she
believes
what
you
tell
her
she
wo
care
to
marry
she
knows
i
not
a
liar
dickey
confound
possibly
but
she
is
hardly
fool
enough
to
break
with
the
prince
unless
you
produce
something
more
substantial
than
your
own
accusation
where
is
your
proof
this
led
to
an
argument
that
lasted
until
the
time
came
for
him
to
go
to
her
home
when
he
left
the
hotel
in
a
cab
he
was
thoroughly
unstrung
but
more
determined
than
ever
as
if
by
magic
there
came
to
life
the
forces
of
the
prince
while
ugo
sat
calmly
in
his
apartment
his
patient
agents
were
dogging
the
man
he
feared
dogging
him
with
the
persistence
and
glee
of
courant
and
his
hirelings
two
of
them
garbed
as
city
watchmen
were
on
the
avenue
louise
almost
as
soon
as
the
man
they
were
watching
by
virtue
of
fate
and
the
obstinacy
of
one
dickey
savage
two
of
quentin
supporters
in
direct
disobedience
of
his
commands
were
whirling
toward
the
spot
on
which
so
many
minds
were
centered
from
a
distance
savage
and
turk
saw
him
rush
from
the
carriage
and
up
the
broad
stone
steps
that
led
to
the
darkened
veranda
from
other
points
of
view
jules
courant
and
his
men
saw
the
same
and
the
former
knew
that
turk
visit
in
the
afternoon
had
resulted
in
the
granting
of
an
interview
no
sooner
had
quentin
entered
the
house
than
a
man
was
despatched
swiftly
to
inform
prince
ugo
that
he
had
not
been
denied
garrison
met
him
in
the
hall
alone
there
was
defiance
in
her
manner
but
he
had
not
come
thus
far
to
be
repulsed
by
such
a
trifle
as
her
opposition
with
rare
cordiality
he
advanced
and
extended
his
hand
good
evening
garrison
i
hardly
expected
to
find
you
and
dorothy
quite
alone
at
this
time
of
she
gave
him
her
hand
involuntarily
he
had
a
way
about
him
and
she
forgot
her
resolve
under
its
influence
there
was
no
smile
on
her
cold
face
however
we
are
usually
engaged
at
this
hour
quentin
but
we
are
at
home
to
no
one
but
you
she
said
meaningly
it
very
good
of
you
perhaps
i
would
better
begin
by
ending
your
suspense
dorothy
refused
to
see
me
and
i
suspect
the
cause
i
am
here
for
an
explanation
from
her
because
i
think
it
is
due
me
i
came
also
to
tell
you
that
i
love
her
and
to
ask
her
if
she
loves
me
if
she
does
not
i
have
but
to
retire
first
apologizing
for
what
you
may
call
reprehensibility
on
my
part
in
presuming
to
address
her
on
such
a
matter
when
i
know
she
is
the
promised
wife
of
another
if
she
loves
me
i
shall
have
the
honor
to
ask
you
for
her
hand
and
to
ask
her
to
terminate
an
engagement
with
a
man
she
does
not
love
i
trust
my
mission
here
is
fully
it
is
very
plain
to
me
quentin
and
i
may
be
equally
frank
with
you
it
is
you
will
of
course
permit
me
to
hear
that
from
the
one
who
has
the
right
to
decide
he
said
my
daughter
consented
to
receive
you
only
because
i
advised
her
to
do
so
i
will
not
speak
now
of
your
unusual
and
unwarranted
behavior
during
the
past
month
nor
will
i
undertake
to
say
how
much
annoyance
and
displeasure
you
have
caused
she
is
the
affianced
wife
of
prince
ravorelli
and
she
marries
him
because
she
loves
him
i
have
given
you
her
for
a
moment
their
eyes
met
like
the
clashing
of
swords
has
she
commissioned
you
to
say
this
to
me
he
asked
his
eyes
penetrating
like
a
knife
i
am
her
mother
not
her
then
i
shall
respectfully
insist
that
she
speak
for
if
a
look
could
kill
a
man
hers
would
have
been
guilty
of
murder
she
is
coming
now
quentin
you
have
but
a
moment
of
doubt
left
she
despises
for
the
first
time
his
composure
wavered
and
his
lips
parted
as
if
to
exclaim
against
such
an
assumption
but
dorothy
was
already
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
pale
cold
and
unfriendly
she
was
the
personification
of
a
tragedy
queen
as
she
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
her
nand
on
the
newell
post
the
lights
from
above
shining
directly
into
a
face
so
disdainful
that
he
could
hardly
believe
it
was
hers
there
was
no
warmth
in
her
voice
when
she
spoke
to
him
who
stood
immovable
speechless
before
her
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
phil
i
have
first
to
ask
if
you
despise
me
he
found
voice
to
say
i
decline
to
answer
that
question
your
mother
has
said
she
should
not
have
done
then
she
has
misrepresented
you
he
cried
taking
several
steps
toward
her
i
did
not
say
that
she
dorothy
what
do
you
mean
by
this
what
right
have
you
to
he
began
fiercely
mr
quentin
exclaimed
garrison
haughtily
well
cried
he
at
bay
and
doggedly
i
must
know
the
truth
will
you
come
to
the
veranda
with
me
dorothy
no
she
replied
without
a
quaver
i
must
talk
with
you
alone
what
i
have
to
say
is
of
the
gravest
importance
it
is
for
your
welfare
and
i
shall
leave
my
own
feelings
out
of
it
if
you
like
but
i
must
and
will
say
what
i
came
here
to
there
is
nothing
that
i
care
to
hear
from
by
all
that
holy
you
shall
hear
it
and
alone
too
he
exclaimed
so
commandingly
that
both
women
started
he
caught
a
quick
flutter
in
dorothy
eyes
and
saw
the
impulse
that
moved
her
lips
almost
to
the
point
of
parting
i
demand
yes
demand
to
be
heard
come
dorothy
for
god
sake
come
he
was
at
her
side
and
before
she
could
prevent
it
had
grasped
her
hand
in
his
own
all
resistance
was
swept
away
like
chaff
before
the
whirlwind
the
elder
woman
so
far
forgot
her
cold
reserve
as
to
blink
her
austere
eyes
while
dorothy
caught
her
breath
looked
startled
and
suffered
herself
to
be
led
to
the
door
without
a
word
of
protest
there
he
paused
and
turned
to
garrison
whose
thunderstruck
countenance
was
afterward
the
subject
of
more
or
less
amusement
to
him
and
if
the
truth
were
known
to
her
daughter
when
i
have
said
all
that
i
have
to
say
to
her
garrison
bring
her
back
to
neither
he
nor
dorothy
uttered
a
word
until
they
stood
before
each
other
in
the
dark
nook
where
on
one
memorable
night
he
had
felt
the
first
savage
blow
of
the
enemy
dorothy
there
can
no
longer
be
any
dissembling
i
love
you
you
have
doubtless
known
it
for
weeks
and
weeks
it
will
avail
you
nothing
to
deny
that
you
love
me
i
have
seen
he
was
charging
hastily
feverishly
i
do
deny
it
how
dare
you
make
such
an
assertion
she
cried
hotly
i
said
it
would
avail
you
nothing
to
deny
it
but
i
expected
the
denial
you
have
not
forgotten
those
dear
days
when
we
were
boy
and
girl
we
both
thought
they
had
gone
from
us
forever
but
we
were
mistaken
i
love
you
as
a
man
loves
only
as
a
man
can
love
who
has
but
one
woman
in
his
world
sit
here
beside
me
i
will
not
she
exclaimed
trembling
in
every
fiber
but
he
gently
firmly
took
her
arm
and
drew
her
to
the
wicker
bench
i
hate
you
philip
quentin
she
half
sobbed
the
powerlessness
to
resist
infuriating
her
beyond
expression
forget
that
i
was
rough
or
harsh
dear
sit
still
he
cried
as
at
the
word
of
endearment
she
attempted
to
rise
you
forget
yourself
you
forget
was
all
she
could
say
why
did
you
refuse
to
see
me
this
afternoon
he
asked
heedlessly
because
i
believed
you
to
be
what
i
now
know
you
are
she
said
turning
on
him
quickly
a
look
of
scorn
in
her
eyes
your
adorer
he
a
coward
she
said
slowly
distinctly
coward
he
gasped
unwilling
to
believe
his
ears
what
i
know
i
may
deserve
the
word
now
but
but
this
afternoon
what
do
you
mean
your
memory
is
very
do
speak
in
riddles
dorothy
he
cried
you
know
how
i
loathe
a
coward
and
i
thought
you
were
a
brave
man
when
i
heard
when
i
was
told
o
it
does
not
seem
possible
that
you
could
be
so
tell
me
what
you
have
heard
he
said
calmly
divining
the
truth
why
did
you
let
dickey
savage
fight
for
you
last
night
where
was
your
manhood
why
did
you
slink
away
from
prince
ravorelli
this
morning
she
said
intensely
who
has
told
you
all
this
he
demanded
no
matter
who
has
told
me
you
did
play
the
part
of
a
coward
what
else
can
you
call
it
i
did
not
have
the
chance
to
fight
last
night
your
plans
went
wrong
dickey
was
my
unintentional
substitute
as
for
ravorelli
challenge
this
morning
i
did
not
refuse
to
meet
that
is
untrue
i
declined
to
fight
the
duel
with
him
but
i
said
i
would
fight
as
we
do
at
home
with
my
hands
would
you
have
me
meet
him
with
deadly
weapons
i
only
know
that
you
refused
to
do
so
and
that
brussels
calls
you
a
you
would
have
had
me
accept
his
challenge
answer
you
lost
every
vestige
of
my
respect
by
refusing
to
do
then
you
wanted
me
to
meet
and
to
kill
him
he
said
accusingly
i
i
oh
it
would
not
have
meant
that
she
gasped
did
you
want
him
to
kill
me
he
went
on
relentlessly
they
would
have
prevented
the
duel
it
could
not
have
gone
so
far
as
that
she
said
trembling
and
terrified
you
know
better
than
that
dorothy
i
would
have
killed
him
had
we
met
do
you
understand
i
would
have
killed
the
man
you
expect
to
marry
have
you
thought
of
that
she
sank
back
in
the
seat
and
looked
at
him
dumbly
horror
in
her
face
that
is
one
reason
why
i
laughed
at
his
ridiculous
challenge
how
could
i
hope
to
claim
the
love
of
the
woman
whose
affianced
husband
i
had
slain
i
can
win
you
with
him
alive
but
i
would
have
built
an
insurmountable
barrier
between
us
had
he
died
by
my
hand
could
you
have
gone
to
the
altar
with
him
if
he
had
killed
me
o
phil
she
whispered
another
reason
why
i
refused
to
accept
his
challenge
was
that
i
could
not
fight
a
phil
quentin
she
cried
indignantly
i
came
here
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
the
man
you
have
promised
to
marry
you
shall
hear
me
to
the
end
too
he
is
as
black
a
coward
as
mean
a
scoundrel
as
ever
came
into
the
despite
her
protests
despite
her
angry
denials
he
told
her
the
story
of
ugo
plotting
from
the
hour
when
he
received
the
mysterious
warning
to
the
moment
when
he
entered
her
home
that
evening
as
he
proceeded
hotly
to
paint
the
prince
in
colors
ugly
and
revolting
she
grew
calmer
colder
at
the
end
she
met
his
flaming
gaze
steadily
do
you
expect
me
to
believe
this
she
asked
i
mean
that
you
shall
he
said
imperatively
it
is
the
if
you
have
finished
this
vile
story
you
may
go
i
can
not
forgive
myself
for
listening
to
you
how
contemptible
you
are
she
said
arising
and
facing
him
with
blazing
eyes
he
came
to
his
feet
and
met
the
look
of
scorn
with
one
which
sent
conviction
to
her
soul
i
have
told
you
the
truth
dorothy
he
said
simply
the
light
in
her
eyes
changed
perceptibly
you
know
i
am
not
a
liar
and
you
know
i
am
not
a
coward
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
veins
sings
out
its
love
for
you
rather
than
see
you
marry
this
man
i
would
kill
him
as
you
advise
even
though
it
cost
me
my
happiness
you
have
heard
me
out
and
you
know
in
your
heart
that
i
have
told
the
i
can
not
i
will
not
believe
it
he
is
the
noblest
of
men
and
he
loves
me
you
do
not
know
how
he
loves
me
i
will
not
believe
you
she
murmured
and
he
knew
his
story
had
found
a
home
she
sank
to
the
seat
again
and
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
as
if
choking
her
eyes
were
upon
the
strong
face
above
her
and
her
heart
raced
back
to
the
hour
not
far
gone
when
it
whispered
to
itself
that
she
loved
the
sweetheart
of
other
days
dorothy
do
you
love
me
he
whispered
dropping
to
her
side
taking
her
hand
in
his
have
you
not
loved
me
all
these
days
and
nights
you
must
not
ask
you
must
not
ask
she
whispered
but
i
do
ask
you
love
me
no
she
cried
recovering
herself
with
a
mighty
effort
listen
i
did
love
you
yes
i
loved
you
until
you
filled
me
with
your
old
self
you
conquered
and
i
was
grieving
myself
to
madness
over
it
all
but
i
do
not
love
you
now
you
must
go
i
do
not
believe
what
you
have
said
of
him
and
i
despise
you
go
dorothy
he
cried
as
she
sped
past
him
think
what
you
are
saying
go
i
hate
you
she
cried
and
was
gone
for
a
moment
he
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
then
there
came
a
rush
of
glad
life
to
his
heart
and
he
could
have
shouted
in
his
jubilance
god
she
loves
me
i
was
not
too
late
she
shall
be
mine
he
dashed
into
the
house
but
the
closing
of
a
door
upstairs
told
him
she
was
beyond
his
reach
the
hall
was
empty
garrison
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
filled
with
the
new
fire
the
new
courage
he
clutched
his
hat
from
the
chair
on
which
he
had
thrown
it
and
rushed
forth
into
the
night
at
the
top
of
the
steps
he
met
prince
ugo
the
two
men
stopped
stockstill
within
a
yard
of
each
other
and
neither
spoke
for
the
longest
of
minutes
you
call
rather
late
prince
said
phil
a
double
meaning
in
his
words
dog
hissed
the
prince
permit
me
to
inform
you
that
miss
garrison
has
retired
it
will
save
you
the
trouble
of
ringing
he
bowed
laughed
sarcastically
and
was
off
down
the
steps
ravorelli
hand
stole
to
an
inside
pocket
and
a
moment
later
the
light
from
the
window
flashed
on
a
shining
thing
in
his
fingers
he
did
not
shoot
but
quentin
never
knew
how
near
he
was
to
death
at
the
hand
of
the
silent
statue
that
stood
there
and
watched
him
until
he
was
lost
in
the
shadows
then
the
prince
put
his
hand
suddenly
to
his
eyes
moaned
as
if
in
pain
and
slowly
descended
the
steps
xvii
a
few
men
and
a
woman
a
stealthy
figure
joined
his
highness
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
coming
from
the
darkness
below
the
veranda
it
was
courant
what
he
said
to
the
prince
when
they
were
safely
away
from
the
house
caused
the
italian
face
to
pale
and
his
hands
to
twitch
with
rage
the
french
detective
had
heard
and
understood
the
conversation
of
the
man
and
woman
on
the
porch
and
he
had
formed
conclusions
that
drove
all
doubt
from
the
mind
of
the
noble
lover
quentin
looked
up
and
down
the
street
for
his
cab
it
was
not
in
sight
but
he
remembered
telling
the
man
to
drive
to
the
corner
below
the
rainstorm
that
had
been
threatening
dry
and
dusty
brussels
all
day
was
beginning
to
show
itself
in
marked
form
there
were
distant
rumbles
of
thunder
and
faint
flashes
of
lightning
and
now
and
then
the
wind
its
velocity
increasing
every
minute
dashed
a
splattering
raindrop
in
one
face
the
storm
for
which
the
city
had
been
crying
was
hurling
itself
along
from
the
sea
and
its
full
fury
was
almost
ready
to
break
the
few
pedestrians
were
scurrying
homeward
the
tram
cars
were
loaded
and
many
cabs
whirled
by
in
the
effort
to
land
their
fares
at
home
before
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
phil
drank
in
the
cool
refreshing
breeze
and
cared
not
if
it
rained
until
the
streets
were
flooded
at
the
corner
stood
a
cab
the
driver
softly
swearing
to
himself
he
swung
down
and
savagely
jerked
open
the
door
back
to
the
bellevue
said
the
fare
airily
as
he
climbed
into
the
vehicle
the
cab
had
started
off
into
a
when
phil
imagined
he
heard
a
shout
in
the
distance
he
looked
forth
but
could
see
no
one
in
the
rushing
darkness
the
rattle
of
the
cab
the
growing
roar
of
the
night
and
toe
swish
of
the
rain
which
was
now
falling
quite
heavily
drowned
all
other
sounds
and
he
leaned
back
contentedly
suddenly
the
cab
came
to
a
stop
loud
voices
were
heard
outside
and
he
was
about
to
throw
open
the
door
when
a
heavy
body
was
flung
against
the
side
of
the
vehicle
the
next
instant
the
glass
in
the
door
was
shattered
and
a
voice
from
the
rainy
night
cried
do
resist
or
you
will
be
shot
to
what
the
dev
gasped
quentin
barely
able
to
distinguish
the
form
of
a
man
at
the
door
some
strange
influence
told
him
that
the
point
of
a
revolver
was
almost
touching
his
breast
and
the
word
died
in
his
mouth
no
outcry
monsieur
your
valuables
without
a
struggle
be
quick
there
are
many
of
us
you
have
no
chance
came
the
hard
voice
in
good
english
but
i
have
no
valuables
your
diamond
ring
and
your
watch
at
least
monsieur
the
ring
is
in
your
vest
search
me
you
scoundrel
i
have
no
ring
and
my
watch
is
in
my
room
i
mighty
slim
picking
for
such
noted
gentlemen
as
you
i
presume
i
have
the
honor
of
meeting
the
diamond
collectors
the
town
is
talking
so
much
he
was
now
aware
of
the
presence
of
another
man
in
the
opposite
window
and
there
was
the
same
uncanny
feeling
that
a
second
revolver
was
levelled
at
his
person
step
outside
monsieur
it
is
cruel
to
force
you
into
the
rain
but
we
assure
you
it
is
very
refreshing
it
will
make
you
grow
whatever
you
choose
to
call
us
we
are
wet
to
the
skin
this
must
not
therefore
be
a
fruitless
job
step
forth
quickly
and
do
not
quentin
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
seeing
resistance
was
useless
boldly
set
foot
upon
the
curbing
a
flash
of
lightning
revealed
four
or
five
men
in
the
group
one
of
them
had
the
driver
covered
with
a
pistol
and
two
of
them
were
ready
to
seize
the
passenger
he
observed
with
amazement
that
one
of
the
men
was
a
policeman
in
full
uniform
officer
he
exclaimed
do
you
see
what
they
are
doing
o
monsieur
said
the
spokesman
pleasantly
you
may
tell
the
police
of
brussels
that
they
can
not
hunt
us
down
until
they
hunt
themselves
down
what
that
a
carriage
quick
your
watch
your
ring
far
down
the
street
could
be
seen
the
lamps
of
an
approaching
cab
and
quentin
heart
took
a
bound
he
had
not
feared
injury
for
he
was
willing
to
submit
to
the
searching
without
resistance
but
now
he
thrilled
with
the
excitement
of
possible
conflict
a
second
flash
in
the
sky
revealed
altered
conditions
in
the
setting
of
the
tragic
scene
the
driver
was
on
his
box
and
the
policeman
was
climbing
up
beside
him
a
short
man
masked
to
the
chin
had
pushed
aside
the
man
with
the
revolver
and
a
harsh
voice
cried
as
the
darkness
shut
out
the
vivid
picture
short
work
of
him
the
knife
the
club
carl
hell
into
the
cab
with
him
shouted
another
voice
and
phil
began
to
strike
out
with
his
fists
but
the
attack
was
too
sharp
the
odds
too
great
something
crashed
down
upon
his
head
he
felt
himself
lunge
backward
into
the
open
cab
door
and
then
a
heavy
body
hurled
itself
upon
his
form
another
stinging
blow
caught
him
over
the
ear
and
as
he
lost
consciousness
a
tremendous
force
seemed
to
be
crushing
the
breath
from
his
body
a
revolver
cracked
but
he
did
not
hear
it
nor
did
he
know
that
friends
were
at
hand
before
the
miscreants
could
hurl
his
body
into
the
cab
a
vehicle
whirled
up
the
feeble
glare
from
its
lanterns
throwing
light
upon
the
scene
the
man
who
had
fired
from
the
door
of
the
second
cab
leaped
to
the
ground
followed
by
a
companion
and
in
a
moment
they
were
among
the
scuffling
robbers
whatever
might
have
been
the
original
intentions
of
quentin
assailants
they
were
not
prepared
to
offer
battle
their
aim
was
to
escape
not
to
fight
a
couple
of
shots
were
fired
a
rush
of
feet
ensued
and
the
earth
seemed
to
swallow
all
but
the
two
newcomers
and
the
limp
figure
that
lay
half
inside
the
cab
in
an
instant
quentin
was
drawn
from
the
cab
by
the
taller
of
the
two
the
smaller
having
made
a
short
dash
in
pursuit
of
the
bandits
blood
rushed
from
the
head
of
the
unconscious
man
and
he
was
a
dead
weight
in
the
arms
of
his
rescuer
good
god
phil
have
they
killed
you
here
turk
never
mind
those
fellows
come
here
quick
we
must
get
him
to
a
surgeon
i
afraid
they
fixed
him
into
our
cab
with
him
gad
he
like
a
rag
it
was
dickey
savage
and
he
was
filled
with
dread
turk
exploding
with
impotent
rage
and
shivering
with
fear
that
his
master
was
dead
came
to
his
assistance
and
they
were
soon
racing
for
the
bellevue
a
pair
of
wondering
patient
driverless
horses
watched
the
departure
but
they
did
not
move
from
the
spot
where
they
had
been
checked
by
the
first
attack
across
the
doubletree
behind
them
hung
the
limp
form
of
their
driver
a
great
gaping
wound
in
his
head
he
had
driven
them
for
the
last
time
and
they
seemed
to
know
that
his
cold
lips
could
never
again
command
them
to
go
driven
almost
to
the
hilt
in
the
floor
of
the
cab
was
an
ugly
knife
its
point
had
been
intended
for
quentin
throat
but
the
hand
that
struck
the
blow
was
not
as
true
as
the
will
of
its
owner
in
a
high
state
of
alarm
and
excitement
the
two
men
in
the
cab
took
their
friend
to
his
room
their
advent
creating
great
commotion
in
the
hotel
the
wildest
curiosity
prevailed
and
they
were
besieged
with
questions
from
hotel
men
guests
and
the
crowd
that
had
found
shelter
from
the
storm
within
ten
minutes
the
news
was
spreading
forth
over
the
city
that
a
wealthy
american
had
been
held
up
and
murdered
by
the
daring
diamond
thieves
police
and
reporters
hurried
to
the
hotel
and
the
uproar
was
intense
the
house
surgeon
was
soon
at
work
with
the
bloody
unconscious
victim
savage
and
turk
with
their
friend
the
millionaire
keeping
the
crowd
away
from
the
couch
it
was
impossible
to
drive
the
people
from
the
room
until
the
police
arrived
there
were
two
ugly
gashes
in
quentin
head
one
of
which
it
was
feared
at
first
would
disclose
a
fracture
of
the
skull
gassbeck
the
surgeon
who
had
attended
a
wounded
prince
in
the
same
hotel
less
that
hours
before
gave
out
as
his
opinion
that
quentin
injuries
were
not
dangerous
unless
unexpected
complications
appeared
several
stitches
were
taken
in
each
cut
and
the
patient
slowly
recovering
from
the
effects
of
the
blows
and
the
anesthetics
was
put
to
bed
by
his
friends
savage
observed
one
thing
when
he
entered
the
hotel
with
the
wounded
man
prince
ugo
and
count
sallaconi
were
among
the
first
to
come
forward
when
the
news
of
the
attack
spread
through
the
office
and
corridors
the
prince
in
fact
was
conversing
with
some
gentlemen
near
the
doors
when
the
party
entered
it
was
he
who
sent
messengers
to
the
central
police
office
and
who
told
the
detectives
where
and
how
he
had
last
seen
the
victim
of
the
diamond
thieves
dickey
sat
all
night
beside
his
rolling
moaning
friend
unnerved
almost
despairing
but
the
morning
brought
the
change
that
gladdened
his
heart
and
gave
him
a
chance
to
forget
his
fears
and
apprehensions
long
enough
to
indulge
in
an
impressive
though
inadequate
degree
of
profanity
with
continued
reference
to
a
certain
set
of
men
whom
the
world
called
thieves
but
whom
he
designated
as
dogs
about
ten
a
telegram
from
ostend
came
to
the
hotel
for
him
it
read
are
you
not
coming
to
ostend
for
us
an
hour
later
a
very
pretty
young
lady
in
ostend
tore
a
telegram
to
pieces
sniffed
angrily
and
vowed
she
would
never
speak
to
a
certain
young
man
again
his
reply
to
her
rather
peremptory
query
by
wire
was
hardly
calculated
to
restore
the
good
humor
she
had
lost
in
not
finding
him
at
the
dock
can
not
come
awfully
sorry
ca
leave
brussels
hurry
on
will
explain
here
richard
her
and
from
london
was
mean
enough
to
tease
her
with
sly
references
to
the
beauty
of
brussels
women
and
the
fickleness
of
all
mankind
and
so
there
was
stored
away
for
savage
benefit
a
very
cruel
surprise
the
morning
newspapers
carried
the
story
of
quentin
adventure
to
the
garrison
home
and
dorothy
face
almost
haggard
as
the
result
of
a
sleepless
night
grew
whiter
still
and
her
tired
eyes
filled
with
dread
she
did
not
have
to
recall
their
conversation
of
the
night
before
for
it
had
not
left
her
mind
but
her
thoughts
went
back
to
a
former
conversation
in
which
he
had
ridiculed
the
bandits
the
newspaper
fell
from
her
nerveless
fingers
and
she
left
the
table
her
breakfast
untouched
stealing
miserably
to
her
room
to
escape
her
mother
inquisitive
eyes
her
wretched
state
was
not
improved
by
the
visit
of
a
veiled
young
woman
later
in
the
day
the
visitor
was
undoubtedly
a
lady
but
the
story
she
poured
into
the
unwilling
ears
was
so
astounding
that
dorothy
dismissed
her
indignantly
before
it
was
finished
the
intense
stranger
young
and
evidently
beautiful
told
her
that
quentin
injuries
were
not
inflicted
by
thieves
but
by
the
hired
agents
of
one
who
had
cause
to
fear
him
before
miss
garrison
could
remonstrate
the
stranger
went
into
the
details
of
a
plot
so
cowardly
that
she
was
horrified
horrified
all
the
more
because
in
a
large
measure
it
sustained
the
charges
made
against
her
lover
by
philip
quentin
when
at
last
she
could
no
longer
endure
the
villifying
recital
she
bade
the
woman
to
leave
the
house
hotly
refusing
to
give
countenance
to
the
lies
she
was
telling
the
stranger
desisted
only
after
her
abject
pleading
had
drawn
from
the
other
a
bitter
threat
to
have
her
ejected
by
the
servants
you
will
not
hear
me
to
the
end
but
you
must
give
me
the
privilege
of
saying
that
i
do
not
come
here
to
do
him
or
you
an
injury
said
the
visitor
tremulously
it
is
to
save
you
from
him
and
to
save
him
for
myself
mademoiselle
i
love
him
he
would
marry
me
were
it
not
for
you
you
think
jealousy
then
inspired
this
visit
i
admit
that
jealousy
is
the
foundation
but
it
does
not
follow
that
i
am
compelled
to
lie
everything
i
have
said
and
would
say
is
true
perhaps
he
loves
you
but
he
loved
me
first
a
week
ago
he
told
me
that
he
loved
me
still
it
was
i
who
warned
the
american
gentleman
against
him
and
my
reason
is
plain
i
want
him
to
win
it
would
mean
death
to
me
if
it
were
known
that
i
came
to
you
with
this
story
do
you
bid
me
go
or
will
you
hear
me
to
the
end
you
must
go
i
can
not
listen
to
the
infamous
things
you
say
about
about
him
said
dorothy
her
voice
choking
toward
the
end
a
horrible
fear
seized
upon
her
heart
was
this
woman
mad
or
had
quentin
told
the
truth
a
new
thought
came
to
her
and
she
grasped
the
woman
hand
with
convulsive
fingers
you
have
been
sent
here
by
quentin
o
how
plain
it
is
why
did
i
not
see
through
it
at
once
go
back
to
your
employer
and
tell
him
that
she
was
crying
hysterically
when
the
woman
snatched
away
her
hand
and
drawing
herself
to
full
height
interrupted
haughtily
i
have
humbled
myself
that
i
might
do
you
the
greatest
service
in
the
world
you
drive
me
from
your
presence
and
you
call
me
a
liar
all
of
that
i
must
endure
but
i
will
not
suffer
you
to
accuse
this
innocent
man
while
i
have
voice
to
offer
up
in
his
defense
i
may
be
some
one
slave
but
i
am
not
the
servant
of
any
man
i
do
not
know
this
american
he
does
not
know
me
i
am
my
own
agent
and
not
his
tool
what
i
have
tried
to
tell
you
is
true
and
i
confess
my
actions
have
been
inspired
by
selfish
motives
mademoiselle
the
man
you
are
to
marry
promised
to
make
me
his
wife
long
before
he
knew
to
make
you
his
wife
absurd
men
of
his
station
do
not
marry
nor
promise
to
marry
the
grisettes
or
the
it
is
not
a
grisette
to
whom
you
are
speaking
the
blood
in
my
veins
is
as
noble
as
that
which
flows
in
his
the
name
i
bear
and
perhaps
disgrace
god
help
me
is
as
proud
as
any
in
all
france
but
i
have
not
millions
as
you
have
my
face
my
person
may
win
and
hold
the
heart
but
i
have
not
the
gold
with
which
to
buy
the
soul
you
will
pardon
my
intrusion
and
you
will
forgive
me
for
any
pang
i
have
caused
he
would
not
harken
to
the
appeals
from
my
breaking
heart
he
would
not
give
me
all
his
love
there
was
left
but
one
course
to
preserve
what
rightfully
belongs
to
me
and
i
have
followed
it
as
a
last
resort
were
you
to
tell
him
that
a
woman
came
to
you
with
this
story
he
would
deny
everything
and
he
would
be
lost
to
me
even
though
you
cast
him
off
in
the
end
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
command
you
to
protect
the
woman
who
is
trying
to
help
you
you
do
not
believe
what
i
have
told
to
you
therefore
i
can
not
hope
for
pity
at
your
hands
you
will
tell
him
that
i
have
been
here
and
i
shall
pay
the
penalty
for
being
the
fool
the
mad
woman
i
am
not
asking
for
pity
if
i
have
lied
to
you
i
deserve
nothing
but
the
hardest
punishment
you
have
one
way
to
punish
me
for
the
wounds
i
inflict
but
it
is
the
same
to
me
no
matter
how
it
ends
if
you
marry
him
i
am
lost
if
you
cast
him
off
and
yet
tell
him
that
it
was
i
who
first
sowed
the
seed
of
distrust
in
your
heart
i
am
lost
it
will
be
the
same
all
the
same
if
he
can
not
wed
you
he
will
come
to
me
and
i
will
forgive
madam
he
is
not
good
enough
for
you
but
he
is
all
the
world
to
me
he
would
wed
you
but
you
are
not
the
one
he
loves
you
are
all
the
world
to
one
whose
love
is
pure
and
honest
if
you
would
save
him
become
his
wife
o
mademoiselle
it
grieves
me
so
to
see
the
tears
in
those
good
eyes
of
yours
farewell
and
god
bless
and
keep

and
the
young
person
with
the
wrath
were
met
at
the
gare
du
nord
by
savage
all
smiles
and
good
spirits
quentin
was
nicely
and
there
was
little
danger
from
complications
this
fact
coupled
with
the
joy
of
seeing
the
girl
who
had
been
able
to
make
him
feel
that
life
was
not
a
shallow
dream
sent
him
up
to
the
two
ladies
with
outstretched
hands
a
dancing
heart
and
a
greeting
that
brought
smiles
to
the
faces
of
crusty
who
had
not
smiled
in
weeks
with
a
deference
due
to
premeditated
gallantry
he
shook
hands
first
with
lady
frances
his
ebullition
almost
swept
him
to
the
point
of
greeting
the
two
maids
who
stood
respectfully
near
their
mistresses
then
he
turned
his
beaming
face
upon
the
arctic
individual
with
the
pink
parasol
and

awfully
sorry
lady
jane
but
i
really

that

for
the
hand
which
had
not
been
extended
not
in
the
least
savage
we
delight
in
traveling
alone
do
you

frances
savage
stared
in
amazement
a
distinct
blighting
frost
settled
over
the
whole
september
world
and
his
smile
lost
all
but
its
breadth
the
joy
left
his
eyes
and
his
heart
like
a
flash
but
his
lips
helplessly
witlessly
maintained
a
hospitality
until
long
after
the
inspiration
was
dead
she
is
not
here
i
am
afraid
responded
lady
saxondale
glancing
through
the
hurrying
crowd

should
say
both
murmured
he
distractedly
does
she
live
here
she
resides
in
a
house
not
in
a
railway
station
observed
lady
jane
with
a
cutting
sarcasm
of
which
she
was
rather
proud
lady
saxondale
turned
her
face
away
and
buried
a
convulsive
smile
in
her
handkerchief
i
mean
in
brussels
floundered
dickey
his
wits
in
the
wind
he
was
gazing
dumbly
at
the
profile
of
the
slim
iceberg
that
had
so
sharply
sent
the
blast
of
winter
across
the
summer
of
his
content
she
certainly
understood
that
we
were
to
come
on
this
train
frances
you
telegraphed
her
said
lady
jane
ignoring
him
completely
she
raised
herself
on
her
dainty
tiptoes
elevated
her
round
little
chin
and
tried
to
peer
over
the
heads
of
a
very
tall
and
disobliging
multitude
dickey
at
a
loss
for
words
stretched
his
neck
also
in
search
of
the
woman
he
did
not
know
how
very
annoying
said
lady
saxondale
a
faint
frown
on
her
brow
she
is
usually
so
perhaps
she
er
did
get
your
telegram
ventured
dickey
what
sort
of
a
looking
i
mean
is
she
old
or
young
neither
she
is
just
my
age
smiled
lady
saxondale
dickey
dumbly
permitted
the
rare
chance
for
a
compliment
to
slip
by
jane
you
and
savage
undertake
a
search
for
her
i
will
give
william
directions
regarding
the
she
turned
to
the
man
and
the
maids
and
savage
and
lady
disdain
were
left
to
work
out
their
salvation
as
best
they
could
i
ca
think
of
troubling
you
savage
it
wo
be
necessary
for
you
to
dodge
around
in
this
crowd
to
no
trouble
i
assure
you
lady
jane
be
glad
to
do
it
in
fact
where
shall

go
first
demanded
he
considerably
flurried
you
go
that
way
and
i
go
this
we
find
her
more
easily
said
she
relentlessly
indicating
the
directions
but
i
do
know
her
he
cried
how
unfortunate
would
you
know
her
if
i
were
to
describe
her
to
you
well
she
tall
and
very
fair
she
also
beautiful
quite
stunning
i
sure
you
know
she
was
starting
away
when
he
confronted
her
desperately
you
have
to
go
with
me
i
be
arrested
for
addressing
the
wrong
lady
if
i
go
alone
and
you
suffer
the
mortification
of
seeing
them
drag
me
off
to
the
what
why
do
you
say
mortification
savage
i
am
quite
sure
o
come
now
jane
aw
lady
jane
what
do
you
mean
by
that
all
the
row
about
what
has
happened
he
cried
i
do
understand
you
something
wrong
or
you
seem
happier
to
see
me
that
all
he
said
helplessly
lord
all
my
troubles
come
at
once
phil
is
half
dead
perhaps
all
dead
by
this
time
and
here
you
come
along
adding
misery
instead
of
phil
quentin
what
did
you
say
dickey
she
cried
her
haughty
reserve
fading
like
a
flash
do
you
know
he
cried
almost
killed
last
night
by
by
robbers
slugged
him
nearly
to
a
finish
horrible
gashes
eight
stitches
he
was
blurting
out
excitedly
but
she
clasped
his
arm
convulsively
and
fairly
dragged
him
to
where
lady
saxondale
stood
oh
dickey
they
did
kill
he
wo
die
will
he
why
did
you
tell
us
before
why
did
you
telegraph
she
cried
and
there
was
no
wrath
in
the
thumping
terrified
little
heart
lady
saxondale
turned
quickly
upon
hearing
the
excited
words
of
the
girl
who
but
a
moment
before
had
been
the
personification
of
reserve
what
are
you
saying
jane
is
there
anything
wrong
she
asked
everything
is
wrong
philip
is
dead
cried
lady
jane
ready
to
faint
dickey
says
there
are
eight
gashes
and
that
he
is
all
dead
why
do
you
tell
us
about
it
dickey
he
all
right
not
dead
at
all
robber
held
him
up
last
night
during
the
storm
and
if
help
had
come
just
when
it
did
have
made
short
work
of
him
but
i
ca
tell
you
about
it
here
you
know
if
you
allow
me
i
take
a
look
for
the
i
go
with
you
said
lady
jane
enthusiastically
dickey
she
went
on
as
they
hurried
away
i
forgive
forgive
me
for
what
he
asked
for
not
coming
to
ostend
demurely
you
really
wanted
me
to
come
did
you
jane
yes
after
i
had
been
goose
enough
to
telegraph
to
you
you
know
you
do
know
how
small
i
felt
when
you
did
not
come
she
hurried
out
but
his
merry
laugh
cut
short
the
humiliating
confession
and
that
was
why
you
yes
that
was
why
do
say
another
word
about
it
though
i
was
such
a
horrid
little
fool
and
i
am
so
ashamed
of
myself
and
you
were
so
worried
all
the
time
about
dear
quentin
she
pleaded
penitently
you
might
have
known
that
nothing
short
of
death
could
have
prevented
me
from
coming
to
ostend
said
he
softly
but
i
all
sorts
of
news
to
tell
you
when
i
tell
you
about
the
duel
you
go
into
convulsions
when
you
hear
a
duel
good
heavens
how
i
mean
who
she
gasped
her
eyes
wider
than
ever
i
do
know
how
but
i
do
know
who
jane
i
have
shot
a
man
he
said
impressively
oh
oh
oh
dickey
she
almost
shrieked
coming
helplessly
to
a
standstill
a
dozen
emotions
crowding
themselves
into
her
pretty
bewildered
face
do
faint
i
tell
you
all
about
it
eh
he
said
hastily
he
was
vastly
afraid
she
might
topple
over
in
a
swoon
i
ca
wait
she
gasped
and
i
will
not
faint
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
this
instant
is
the
other
man
is
he
where
is
he
he
in
a
hospital
everybody
staring
at
us
what
a
fool
i
was
to
say
anything
about
it
i
wo
tell
you
another
word
of
oh
dickey
please
she
implored
he
was
obdurate
and
her
manner
changed
suddenly
with
blighting
scorn
she
exclaimed
i
believe
a
word
you
o
now
that
hardly
a
nice
way
he
began
indignantly
catching
himself
luckily
before
floundering
into
her
trap
you
will
have
to
wait
just
the
same
miss
lady
jane
oldham
just
now
we
are
supposed
to
be
searching
for
a
baroness
who
is
good
enough
to
come
to
railway
stations
you
remember
have
you
seen
her
at
this
juncture
lady
saxondale
voice
was
heard
behind
them
and
there
were
traces
of
laughter
in
the
tones
are
you
waiting
for
the
mountain
to
come
to
you
here
is
the
baroness
delayed
by
an
accident
to
her
savage
was
presented
to
the
handsome
rather
dashing
lady
whose
smile
was
as
broad
and
significant
as
that
which
still
left
traces
about
lady
saxondale
lips
he
bowed
deeply
to
hide
the
red
in
his
cheeks
and
the
confusion
in
his
eyes
his
companion
on
the
other
hand
greeted
the
stranger
so
effusively
that
he
found
it
possible
during
the
moments
of
merry
chatter
to
regain
a
fair
proportion
of
his
lost
composure
the
baroness
auge
was
an
english
woman
famed
as
a
whip
a
golfer
and
an
entertainer
her
salon
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
the
most
delightful
in
brussels
her
husband
and
her
rollicking
little
boys
were
not
a
whit
less
attractive
than
herself
and
her
household
was
the
wonder
of
that
gay
careless
city
the
baron
a
belgian
of
wealth
was
as
merry
a
nobleman
as
ever
set
forth
to
seek
the
pleasures
of
life
his
board
was
known
as
the
most
bountiful
his
home
the
cheeriest
and
most
hospitable
his
horses
the
best
bred
in
all
brussels
he
loved
his
wife
and
indulged
her
every
whim
and
she
adored
him
theirs
was
a
home
in
which
the
laugh
seldom
gave
way
to
the
frown
where
happiness
dwelt
undisturbed
and
merriment
kept
the
rafters
twitching
with
them
the
two
london
women
were
to
stop
until
after
the
wedding
saxondale
was
to
visit
his
grim
old
castle
in
luxemburg
for
several
days
before
coming
up
to
brussels
and
he
was
not
to
leave
england
for
another
week
baron
auge
was
looking
over
his
estates
in
the
north
of
belgium
but
was
expected
home
before
the
week
end
savage
was
in
an
unusual
flutter
of
exhilaration
when
he
rushed
into
quentin
presence
soon
after
the
ladies
drove
away
from
the
gare
du
nord
the
baroness
had
warmly
insisted
that
he
come
that
evening
to
regale
them
with
the
story
of
the
robbery
and
the
account
of
the
duel
a
faint
and
tantalizing
rumor
of
which
had
come
to
her
ears
the
baroness
lives
on
the
avenue
louise
old
man
he
said
after
he
had
described
her
glowingly
a
long
cool
drink
ran
down
his
dry
throat
before
his
listener
propped
up
in
his
bed
and
looking
upon
his
friend
with
somber
eyes
deigned
to
break
the
silence
so
you
are
to
tell
them
about
the
duel
dickey
he
said
slowly
they
crazy
about
i
thought
it
was
to
be
kept
as
dark
as
dickey
jaw
dropped
and
his
eyes
lost
their
gleam
of
satisfaction
by
thunder
i
i
forgot
that
he
exclaimed
what
am
i
to
do
he
went
on
after
a
moment
of
perplexity
and
dismay
the
long
cool
drink
seemed
to
have
left
a
disagreeable
taste
in
his
mouth
and
he
gulped
feebly
commit
suicide
i
should
say
i
see
no
other
way
out
of
it
advised
the
man
in
the
bed
soberly
the
misery
in
dickey
face
was
beyond
description
and
the
perspiration
that
stood
on
his
brow
came
not
from
the
heat
of
the
day
did
you
ever
know
a
bigger
ass
than
i
phil
now
did
you
honestly
he
groaned
i
believe
i
can
outrank
you
myself
dickey
it
seems
to
me
we
are
out
of
our
class
when
it
comes
to
diplomacy
give
lady
saxondale
and
lady
jane
my
compliments
and
tell
them
i
hope
to
see
them
before
i
sail
for
what
that
in
astonishment
before
i
sail
for
going
to
give
it
up
are
you
she
thinks
i
a
liar
so
what
is
the
use
you
did
talk
that
way
this
morning
you
swore
she
believed
everything
you
said
and
that
she
cares
for
you
anything
happened
since
then
nothing
but
the
opportunity
to
think
it
all
over
while
these
bandages
hold
my
brain
in
one
place
her
mind
is
made
up
and
i
change
it
truth
or
no
truth
she
never
know
what
a
villian
ravorelli
or
pavesi
is
until
it
is
too
you
feel
better
old
man
the
stitches
hurt
like
the
devil
do
they
cheer
up
old
chap
i
the
one
who
needs
encouragement
see
what
i
have
to
face
good
lord
be
three
women
at
least
maybe
a
dozen
begging
commanding
me
to
tell
all
about
that
confounded
shooting
match
and
i
was
getting
along
so
nicely
with
her
too
he
concluded
dolefully
with
the
baroness
on
such
short
acquaintance
no
of
course
not
with
jane
oldham
i
do
know
how
i
going
to
square
it
with
her
by
jove
i
do
say
i
bet
my
head
i
bray
in
my
sleep
do
i
that
the
kind
of
an
ass
i
when
he
looked
listlessly
into
quentin
room
late
that
evening
he
wore
the
air
of
a
martyr
but
he
was
confident
he
had
scored
a
triumph
in
diplomacy
diplomacy
in
his
estimation
was
the
dignified
synonym
for
lying
for
an
hour
he
had
lied
like
a
trooper
to
three
women
he
left
them
struggling
with
the
conviction
that
all
the
rest
of
the
world
lied
and
he
alone
told
the
truth
with
the
perspiration
of
despair
on
his
brow
he
had
convinced
them
that
there
had
been
no
real
duel
just
a
trifling
conflict
in
which
he
being
a
good
yankee
had
come
off
with
a
moderate
victory
lady
jane
believed
lady
saxondale
was
more
or
less
skeptical
while
the
baroness
although
graciously
accepting
his
story
as
it
came
from
his
blundering
lips
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
his
story
of
the
robbery
was
told
so
readily
and
so
graphically
that
it
could
not
be
doubted
like
true
women
lady
saxondale
and
her
sister
accompanied
by
their
hostess
and
her
brother
colonel
denslow
seized
the
first
favorable
opportunity
to
call
at
the
rooms
of
quentin
they
found
him
the
next
morning
sitting
up
in
a
comfortable
chair
the
picture
of
desolation
notwithstanding
the
mighty
efforts
of
dickey
savage
and
the
convivial
millionaire
the
arrival
of
the
party
put
new
life
into
the
situation
and
it
was
not
long
before
phil
found
his
spirits
soaring
skyward
tell
me
the
truth
about
this
awful
duel
commanded
lady
saxondale
after
dickey
had
collected
the
other
members
of
the
party
about
a
table
to
which
tall
glasses
with
small
stems
were
brought
at
his
call
i
afraid
dickey
has
been
a
bit
too
loquacious
said
he
smilingly
he
fibs
so
wretchedly
you
know
one
could
see
he
had
been
told
what
not
to
say
you
can
trust
me
phil
she
said
earnestly
and
he
told
her
all
from
beginning
to
end
not
once
did
she
interrupt
and
but
seldom
did
she
allow
horror
to
show
itself
in
her
clear
brave
eyes
and
she
will
go
on
and
marry
this
man
phil
i
am
afraid
she
can
not
be
convinced
or
will
not
i
should
say
she
said
slowly
at
the
end
of
the
recital
what
a
villain
what
a
coward
he
is
but
she
must
not
be
sacrificed
frances
she
must
be
saved
good
god
ca
something
be
done
to
drag
her
from
the
clutches
of
that
scoundrel
he
almost
groaned
the
clutches
of
her
mother
are
more
vicious
than
those
of
the
prince
there
is
the
power
that
dominates
can
it
be
broken
as
well
try
to
break
down
the
rocky
mountains
that
woman
has
no
heart
no
soul
i
swear
dorothy
has
a
mind
and
a
will
of
her
own
though
frances
i
feel
that
she
loves
me
something
tells
me
she
does
but
she
will
not
break
this
hateful
compact
i
am
sure
that
i
saw
love
in
her
eyes
that
last
night
heard
it
in
her
voice
felt
it
in
the
way
she
dismissed
you
made
a
mistake
when
you
denounced
him
to
her
it
was
but
natural
for
her
to
defend
i
know
it
but
i
was
driven
to
it
i
saw
no
other
way
she
accused
me
of
cowardice
good
heavens
i
give
my
soul
to
be
up
now
and
able
to
call
that
villain
bluff
but
i
am
in
here
for
a
week
at
least
and
the
wedding
is
only
two
weeks
away
when
is
bob
coming
he
cried
feverishly
be
calm
phil
you
will
gain
nothing
by
working
yourself
into
a
frenzy
bob
will
come
when
i
send
for
him
it
shall
be
at
once
if
you
have
need
for
him
i
want
him
immediately
but
i
can
not
ask
him
or
you
to
mix
in
this
miserable
game
there
may
be
a
scandal
and
i
wo
drag
you
all
into
it
he
said
dejectedly
i
send
for
bob
just
the
same
dear
boy
what
are
friends
for
pray
she
left
him
with
the
firm
and
secret
determination
to
carry
the
war
for
friendship
sake
to
the
very
door
of
dorothy
stubborn
heart
and
that
without
delay
xix
the
day
of
the
wedding
when
lord
bob
reached
brussels
on
friday
he
found
affairs
in
a
sorry
shape
his
wife
serenity
was
in
a
sad
state
of
collapse
quentin
was
showing
wonderful
signs
of
recuperation
and
it
almost
required
lock
and
key
to
keep
him
from
breaking
forth
into
the
wildest
indiscretions
gradually
and
somewhat
disconnectedly
he
became
acquainted
with
existing
conditions
he
first
learned
that
his
wife
had
carried
quentin
banner
boldly
up
to
the
walls
of
the
fortress
and
then
well
lady
saxondale
pride
was
very
much
hurt
by
what
happened
there
miss
garrison
was
exceedingly
polite
but
quite
ungrateful
for
the
kindness
that
was
being
bestowed
upon
her
she
assured
her
ladyship
that
she
was
making
no
mistake
in
marrying
prince
ravorelli
and
if
she
were
she
alone
would
suffer
i
am
so
furious
with
her
bob
for
marrying
prince
ugo
that
i
am
not
going
to
the
wedding
said
lady
saxondale
whew
that
a
bracer
but
by
the
way
my
dear
did
you
introduce
any
real
proof
that
he
is
the
scoundrel
you
say
he
is
seems
to
me
the
poor
girl
is
right
in
the
stand
she
takes
she
wants
proof
and
positive
proof
you
know
i
do
blame
her
how
the
deuce
can
she
break
it
off
with
the
fellow
on
the
flimsy
excuse
that
phil
quentin
and
lady
saxondale
say
he
is
a
rascal
you
all
been
acting
like
a
tribe
of
ninnies
if
you
pardon
my
saying
she
is
sensible
enough
to
know
that
we
would
not
misrepresent
matters
to
her
in
such
a
serious
case
as
this
she
retorted
what
proof
have
you
that
ravorelli
is
a
villain
good
heavens
bob
did
he
not
try
to
have
phil
murdered
she
exclaimed
pityingly
do
you
know
that
to
be
a
positive
fact
phil
and
savage
are
quite
thoroughly
but
if
anyone
asked
you
to
go
on
to
the
witness
stand
and
swear
that
prince
ugo
tried
to
take
the
life
of
philip
quentin
could
you
do
so
he
persisted
you
goose
i
was
not
an
how
could
i
swear
to
such
a
thing
well
if
i
understand
the
situation
correctly
miss
garrison
is
the
judge
ravorelli
the
accused
and
you
are
one
of
the
witnesses
now
really
dear
how
far
do
you
imagine
your
hearsay
evidence
which
is
no
evidence
at
all
goes
with
the
fair
magistrate
what
would
be
your
verdict
if
some
one
were
to
come
to
you
and
say
is
a
blackguard
a
rascal
a
cutthroat
i
confess
i
say
it
was
not
true
she
said
turning
quite
red
the
chances
are
you
would
even
ask
for
proof
so
you
see
miss
garrison
behaved
very
generously
when
she
condescended
to
hear
your
assertions
instead
of
instructing
the
servant
to
direct
you
to
the
she
was
above
reproach
bob
i
never
saw
anyone
so
calm
so
composed
and
so
frigidly
agreeable
if
she
had
shown
the
faintest
sign
of
anger
displeasure
or
even
disgust
i
could
forgive
her
but
she
acted
just
as
if
she
were
tolerating
me
rather
than
to
lower
herself
to
the
point
of
seriously
considering
a
word
i
uttered
i
know
the
prince
is
a
villian
i
believe
every
word
phil
says
about
she
took
lord
bob
hands
in
hers
and
her
deep
earnest
eyes
burnt
conviction
into
his
brain
and
so
do
i
frances
i
am
as
sure
that
ugo
is
a
scoundrel
as
if
i
had
personal
knowledge
of
his
transactions
in
fact
i
have
never
believed
in
him
you
and
i
will
stand
together
dear
in
this
fight
for
poor
old
phil
and
by
the
lord
harry
they
find
us
worth
backing
to
the
finish
if
anything
to
be
done
that
can
be
done
we
do
it
my
and
he
was
amply
repaid
for
his
loyal
declaration
by
the
love
that
shone
refulgent
from
her
eyes
quentin
naturally
chafed
under
the
restraint
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
nothing
his
friends
could
do
to
avert
the
disaster
that
was
daily
drawing
nearer
lord
bob
infused
a
momentary
spark
of
hope
into
the
dying
fire
of
his
courage
but
even
the
resourceful
briton
admitted
that
the
prospect
was
too
gloomy
to
warrant
the
slightest
encouragement
they
could
gain
absolutely
no
headway
against
the
prince
for
there
was
no
actual
proof
to
be
had
to
find
the
strange
woman
who
gave
the
first
warning
to
quentin
was
out
of
the
question
turk
had
watched
every
movement
of
the
prince
and
his
aides
in
the
hope
of
in
some
way
securing
a
clue
to
her
identity
or
whereabouts
there
was
but
one
proposition
left
the
purchase
of
courant
this
plan
seemed
feasible
until
turk
reported
after
diligent
search
that
the
french
detective
could
not
be
found
dickey
was
for
buying
the
two
italian
noblemen
but
that
seemed
out
of
the
question
and
it
was
unreasonable
to
suspect
that
the
other
hirelings
recognized
the
prince
as
their
real
employer
the
slightest
move
to
approach
the
two
noblemen
might
prove
disastrous
and
wisdom
cut
off
dickey
glorious
scheme
to
give
each
of
them
a
hundred
dollars
to
tell
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
quentin
at
last
burst
all
bonds
and
finding
himself
out
of
the
doctor
hands
determined
to
make
a
last
desperate
appeal
to
dorothy
garrison
if
that
appeal
failed
he
would
then
give
up
the
struggle
he
would
at
least
end
the
suspense
he
knew
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
obtain
an
audience
with
her
but
he
went
ahead
with
the
confidence
of
the
drowning
man
the
boldness
of
the
man
who
is
wounded
to
the
death
but
does
not
know
it
it
was
the
wednesday
just
one
week
before
the
wedding
that
saw
the
tall
and
somewhat
unsteady
american
deliberately
leave
his
cab
and
stride
manfully
up
the
steps
of
a
certain
mansion
in
the
avenue
louise
miss
garrison
was
not
at
home
and
her
mother
was
not
at
so
said
the
obsequious
footman
take
my
card
to
miss
garrison
said
quentin
coolly
the
man
looked
bewildered
and
was
protesting
that
his
young
mistress
was
not
in
the
house
when
the
lady
herself
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
broad
stairway
phil
stood
in
the
center
of
the
hall
watching
her
as
she
slowly
descended
the
steps
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
she
paused
neither
spoke
neither
smiled
for
the
crisis
was
upon
them
if
he
were
pale
from
the
loss
of
blood
she
was
white
with
the
aches
from
a
heart
why
have
you
come
she
asked
at
last
her
voice
so
low
that
the
words
scarcely
reached
his
ears
dorothy
was
all
he
said
you
knew
what
i
must
say
to
you
before
you
entered
the
door
will
you
let
me
tell
you
how
deeply
i
have
grieved
over
your
misfortune
are
you
quite
wise
in
coming
out
before
you
have
the
strength
you
are
so
pale
so
weak
wo
you
go
back
to
your
to
your
hotel
and
save
yourself
all
the
pain
that
will
come
to
you
here
there
was
pity
in
her
eyes
entreaty
in
her
voice
and
he
was
enveloped
in
the
tender
warmth
of
her
sincerity
never
had
she
seemed
so
near
as
now
and
yet
never
so
far
away
dorothy
you
must
know
what
manner
of
love
it
is
that
brings
me
to
plead
for
the
smallest
crumb
of
what
has
been
once
refused
i
come
simply
in
all
humility
with
outstretched
hands
to
ask
your
he
drew
nearer
and
she
did
not
retreat
oh
it
is
so
useless
so
hopeless
phil
she
said
softly
why
will
you
persist
i
can
not
grant
even
the
i
love
you
dorothy
he
cried
passionately
oh
phil
you
must
understand
that
i
can
give
you
nothing
absolutely
nothing
for
god
sake
for
my
sake
for
the
sake
of
that
dear
friendship
we
own
together
go
away
and
forget
forget
everything
she
said
piteously
a
later
he
slowly
descended
the
steps
staggering
like
a
man
sick
unto
death
she
sat
where
he
left
her
her
wide
dry
eyes
seeing
nothing
her
ears
hearing
nothing
but
the
words
his
love
had
forced
her
to
utter
these
words
yes
heaven
help
me
i
do
care
for
you
but
go
go
i
can
never
see
you
again
i
shall
keep
the
bargain
i
have
made
if
i
die
at
the
altar
i
can
not
break
my
promise
to
and
all
his
pleading
could
not
break
down
that
decision
not
even
when
she
found
herself
for
one
brief
terrible
instant
in
his
straining
arms
his
lips
upon
hers
it
was
all
over
he
calmly
told
his
friends
as
he
had
told
her
that
he
would
sail
for
new
york
on
the
first
steamer
and
turk
reluctantly
began
to
pack
the
things
the
night
before
he
was
to
leave
for
hamburg
the
saxondales
lady
jane
and
savage
sat
with
him
long
into
the
night
prince
ugo
watchdogs
were
not
long
in
discovering
the
sudden
turn
affairs
had
taken
and
he
was
gleefully
celebrating
the
capitulation
the
next
day
the
saxondales
accompanied
the
two
americans
to
the
railway
station
bade
them
a
fond
farewell
and
hastened
back
to
the
home
of
the
baron
auge
with
new
resolutions
in
their
hearts
the
forepart
of
the
ensuing
week
saw
their
departure
from
brussels
deliberately
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
great
wedding
that
was
to
come
and
as
if
scorning
it
completely
journeyed
to
lord
ruins
in
luxemburg
preferring
the
picturesque
solitude
of
the
tumbledown
castle
to
the
empty
spectacle
at
gudule
brussels
may
have
wondered
at
their
strange
on
the
eve
of
the
wedding
but
no
explanation
was
offered
by
the
departing
ones
when
dorothy
garrison
heard
that
philip
quentin
had
started
for
the
united
states
she
felt
a
chill
of
regret
sink
suddenly
into
her
soul
and
it
would
not
be
driven
forth
she
went
on
to
the
very
night
that
was
to
make
her
a
princess
with
the
steel
in
her
heart
but
the
world
did
not
know
it
was
there
there
was
no
faltering
no
wavering
no
outward
sign
of
the
emotions
which
surged
within
she
was
to
be
a
princess
but
when
the
saxondales
turned
their
faces
from
her
spurning
the
invitation
to
her
wedding
the
pride
in
her
heart
suffered
that
was
a
blow
she
had
not
expected
it
was
like
an
accusation
a
reproach
little
lady
jane
blissfully
carried
with
her
to
the
valley
of
the
alzette
the
consciousness
that
richard
savage
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
even
though
he
had
not
found
courage
to
tell
her
so
in
plain
words
a
telegram
from
him
stating
that
he
and
quentin
had
taken
passage
for
new
york
and
would
sail
on
the
following
day
dispelled
the
hope
that
he
might
return
brussels
was
full
of
notables
the
newspapers
of
two
continents
were
fairly
blazing
with
details
of
the
wedding
there
were
portraits
of
the
bride
and
groom
and
the
bishop
and
pictures
of
the
gowns
the
hats
the
jewels
there
were
biographies
of
the
noted
beauty
and
the
man
she
was
to
marry
the
brussels
papers
teemed
with
the
arrivals
of
distinguished
guests
overcoming
garrison
objections
dorothy
had
insisted
on
and
obtained
special
permission
to
have
a
night
wedding
she
had
dreamed
of
the
lights
the
splendor
the
brilliancy
of
an
wedding
and
would
not
be
satisfied
until
all
barriers
were
put
aside
dorothy
uncle
henry
van
dykman
her
mother
brother
and
a
number
of
elated
new
york
relatives
came
to
the
belgian
capital
shedding
their
american
opulence
as
the
sun
throws
out
its
light
the
skill
of
a
general
was
required
to
direct
manage
and
control
the
pageant
of
the
sixteenth
thousands
of
dollars
were
tossed
into
the
cauldron
of
social
ambition
by
the
lavish
mother
who
from
behind
an
army
of
lieutenants
directed
the
preliminary
maneuvers
the
day
came
at
last
and
gudule
presented
a
scene
so
bewilderingly
so
dazzlingly
glorious
that
all
brussels
blinked
its
eyes
and
was
awed
into
silence
the
church
gleamed
with
the
wealth
of
the
universe
it
seemed
and
no
words
could
describe
the
brilliancy
of
the
occasion
the
hour
of
this
woman
triumph
had
come
the
hour
of
the
italian
conqueror
had
come
the
hour
of
the
victim
had
come
in
front
of
the
house
in
the
avenue
louise
an
hour
before
the
beginning
of
the
ceremony
there
stood
the
landau
that
was
to
take
the
bride
to
the
cathedral
carriage
after
carriage
passed
bearing
the
visitors
from
the
new
world
to
the
church
all
were
gone
save
the
bride
her
mother
and
her
uncle
down
the
carpeted
steps
and
across
to
the
door
of
the
carriage
came
dorothy
and
her
uncle
followed
by
the
genius
of
the
hour
at
the
last
moment
dorothy
shuddered
turned
sick
and
faint
for
an
instant
as
she
thought
of
a
ship
far
out
at
sea
the
footman
swung
up
beside
the
driver
and
they
were
off
by
quiet
streets
toward
the
church
where
waited
all
impatient
the
vast
assemblage
and
the
triumphant
prince
the
silence
inside
the
carriage
was
like
that
of
the
tomb
what
were
the
thoughts
of
the
occupants
could
not
well
be
described
are
we
not
almost
there
dorothy
nervously
asked
her
mother
after
many
minutes
good
heavens
we
are
late
o
what
shall
we
do
cried
she
in
despair
in
an
instant
the
somber
silence
of
the
cab
interior
was
lost
the
girl
forgot
her
prayer
in
the
horror
of
the
discovery
that
there
was
to
be
a
hitch
in
the
arrangements
her
mother
frantically
pulled
aside
the
curtains
and
looked
out
fondly
expecting
to
see
the
lights
of
gudule
on
the
hill
uncle
henry
dropped
his
watch
in
his
nervousness
and
was
all
confusion
we
are
not
near
the
church
my
why
where
are
we
i
have
never
seen
these
houses
before
henry
henry
call
to
the
driver
he
has
lost
his
way
my
heavens
be
quick
it
was
not
necessary
to
hail
the
driver
for
at
that
instant
the
carriage
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
the
door
opened
quickly
and
before
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
occupants
loomed
the
form
of
a
masked
man
in
his
hand
he
held
a
revolver
xx
with
strange
companions
a
word
a
sound
and
i
fire
came
the
cold
hard
voice
of
the
man
in
the
mask
he
spoke
in
french
the
trio
sat
petrified
speechless
breathless
so
sudden
so
stunning
was
the
shock
to
their
senses
that
they
were
as
graven
images
for
the
moment
there
was
no
impulse
to
scream
to
resist
they
had
no
power
to
da
either
we
will
injure
no
one
unless
there
is
an
outcry
or
a
struggle
monsieur
madame
there
is
no
occasion
for
alarm
no
more
is
there
a
chance
to
escape
said
the
mask
quietly
three
pairs
of
eyes
looked
dumbly
into
the
gleaming
holes
in
the
black
mask
that
covered
his
face
the
police
finally
whispered
garrison
coming
slowly
out
of
her
stupor
silence
madame
you
are
not
to
speak
faint
if
you
like
we
will
not
object
to
that
and
it
may
be
a
relief
to
you
said
the
man
sarcastically
gallant
i
must
ask
you
to
make
room
for
me
inside
the
carriage
we
can
not
remain
here
the
police
may
come
this
way
i
mean
those
who
are
not
engaged
in
guarding
the
grand
cathedral
to
which
you
were
he
was
inside
the
carriage
and
sitting
beside
dorothy
when
he
concluded
the
last
observation
with
a
shudder
she
drew
away
from
him
pardon
mademoiselle
i
must
implore
you
to
endure
my
presence
here
for
a
time
we
have
quite
a
distance
to
travel
a
nameless
dread
sent
chills
to
the
hearts
which
had
begun
to
thump
wildly
in
the
reaction
what
did
he
mean
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
us
groaned
the
horrified
mother
the
carriage
was
now
moving
rapidly
over
the
pavement
in
due
time
you
may
know
madame
you
have
only
to
be
patient
for
the
moment
it
is
necessary
that
you
keep
perfectly
quiet
although
you
are
a
woman
i
shall
have
to
kill
you
if
you
disobey
my
commands
we
take
desperate
chances
in
the
coup
which
shall
make
all
europe
ring
with
the
crowning
act
of
the
great
diamond
robbers
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
us
and
we
can
brook
no
resistance
you
see
my
revolver
monsieur
it
is
on
a
direct
line
with
your
breast
you
are
americans
i
am
told
and
your
people
are
noted
for
coolness
for
discretion
under
trying
circumstances
your
women
are
as
brave
as
your
men
i
merely
ask
you
to
call
your
courage
you
shall
not
go
on
monster
exclaimed
garrison
fiercely
do
you
know
who
we
are
surely
you
are
not
inhuman
enough
to
madame
i
warn
you
for
the
last
time
you
must
be
reasonable
resistance
argument
pleading
will
avail
you
nothing
if
you
desire
to
discuss
the
situation
calmly
sensibly
you
may
do
so
but
you
are
to
go
only
so
far
as
i
see
fit
will
you
remember
there
was
no
mistaking
the
earnestness
of
the
speaker
garrison
realized
that
she
was
absolutely
powerless
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
bold
intruder
what
must
we
pay
then
for
our
freedom
name
the
price
man
order
your
men
to
drive
us
to
gudule
and
anything
you
ask
is
yours
i
implore
you
to
be
generous
think
monsieur
think
what
this
means
to
us
she
said
desperately
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
dictate
terms
madame
it
is
only
my
duty
to
carry
out
my
part
of
the
transaction
another
will
make
terms
with
but
when
when
we
can
not
be
delayed
a
moment
longer
the
hour
has
already
passed
when
my
daughter
should
be
before
the
altar
for
god
sake
name
your
price
i
will
pay
i
will
pay
sobbed
the
woman
sir
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
demanded
the
quaking
old
man
finding
his
voice
at
last
you
must
listen
to
reason
think
of
yourself
if
not
of
us
what
will
become
of
you
when
you
are
caught
pause
in
this
awful
crime
and
think
you
are
kind
monsieur
to
advise
me
but
it
is
too
will
you
take
us
to
gudule
cried
the
elder
woman
on
the
verge
of
collapse
i
will
give
you
all
you
ask
ten
thousand
dollars
is
yours
if
you
abandon
this
damnable
began
van
dykman
it
will
avail
nothing
to
offer
me
money
interrupted
the
master
of
the
situation
harshly
that
is
the
end
of
it
believe
me
money
is
not
what
we
are
after
perhaps
it
may
tempt
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
us
cried
the
girl
horror
in
her
voice
we
do
not
mean
to
harm
you
mademoiselle
if
you
are
sensible
and
do
as
we
but
the
wedding
the
wedding
moaned
garrison
what
will
they
think
of
us
o
monsieur
if
you
are
one
of
the
great
diamond
robbers
i
willingly
give
all
that
i
have
about
me
on
my
person
there
are
jewels
valued
at
many
thousand
another
word
madame
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
use
force
said
the
man
leaning
forward
threateningly
in
the
darkness
they
could
feel
the
menace
in
his
eyes
you
are
determined
to
go
on
with
this
outrage
asked
van
dykman
a
coup
so
well
planned
as
this
can
not
be
given
up
monsieur
we
flatter
ourselves
that
no
such
job
has
ever
graced
the
history
of
europe
said
the
stranger
pleasantly
down
in
your
hearts
i
believe
you
will
some
day
express
admiration
for
the
way
in
which
the
abduction
has
been
abduction
gasped
garrison
dorothy
sank
back
into
the
corner
at
that
word
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
heart
would
never
beat
again
where
do
you
mean
to
take
us
and
what
is
your
object
slowly
asked
garrison
a
peculiar
sense
of
resignation
coming
over
her
it
was
as
if
she
recognized
the
utter
hopelessness
of
escape
from
the
hands
of
these
skillful
wretches
she
now
saw
that
the
mind
which
had
planned
the
capture
was
one
that
could
carry
the
game
to
the
end
without
a
flaw
in
the
operations
i
can
answer
neither
question
madame
suffice
to
say
that
you
are
rich
and
we
are
poor
i
leave
the
rest
for
your
imagination
it
grieves
us
of
course
to
mar
the
grand
wedding
of
but
you
will
readily
understand
that
at
no
other
time
could
we
find
you
so
well
prepared
truly
i
wonder
what
they
are
doing
in
my
coachman
my
footman
my
servants
it
seems
are
your
accomplices
said
garrison
steadily
not
at
all
madame
your
coachman
and
your
footman
will
be
found
where
we
confined
them
the
men
here
have
never
been
in
your
employ
i
could
recommend
them
to
you
however
they
are
most
trusty
faithful
fellows
and
they
would
be
loyal
to
you
to
the
for
god
sake
where
are
we
burst
forth
van
dykman
unable
to
control
his
fear
longer
we
are
near
the
edge
of
the
city
and
will
soon
be
beyond
the
limits
i
must
command
absolute
silence
for
the
next
not
a
word
must
be
spoken
as
we
are
passing
a
point
of
danger
do
not
permit
hope
of
rescue
to
enter
your
minds
however
for
there
is
no
chance
i
may
enlighten
you
by
saying
that
the
revolvers
i
carry
work
safely
quietly
and
very
effectually
will
you
join
me
in
a
silent
consideration
of
the
scenes
that
are
now
taking
place
in
old
gudule
i
am
sure
there
is
no
limit
to
the
imagination
when
we
give
over
our
thoughts
to
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
desire
to
shriek
to
call
for
help
to
tear
away
the
window
curtains
the
three
helpless
captives
were
unable
to
break
through
the
influence
this
lone
bandit
spread
about
them
the
thought
of
gudule
of
the
great
gathering
of
the
impatience
the
consternation
the
sensation
occasioned
by
the
of
the
bride
brought
madness
to
the
brains
of
the
hapless
trio
like
a
vivid
panorama
they
saw
everything
that
was
going
on
in
the
church
they
saw
alarm
in
faces
of
those
closely
interested
in
the
wedding
heard
the
vague
rumors
and
questionings
the
order
for
the
search
the
report
of
accident
and
then
the
police
and
newspapers
at
last
the
carriage
came
to
a
stop
and
the
footman
swung
down
from
the
seat
opening
the
door
quickly
that
they
were
far
beyond
the
streets
of
the
city
was
apparent
in
the
oppressive
stillness
broken
only
by
the
heavy
panting
of
the
horses
this
is
the
place
came
in
the
coarse
voice
of
the
footman
we
have
no
time
to
then
i
must
ask
you
to
get
down
monsieur
and
the
ladies
we
are
about
to
enter
a
house
for
a
short
while
the
better
to
complete
the
details
of
our
little
transactions
remember
no
noise
means
no
violence
be
quick
thus
spoke
the
man
in
the
seat
who
an
instant
later
stepped
forth
into
the
darkness
the
trembling
sobbing
women
dragged
themselves
to
the
ground
their
gorgeous
gowns
trailing
in
the
dust
unthought
of
and
unprotected
van
dykman
old
as
he
was
took
courage
in
the
momentary
relaxation
and
attempted
to
halloo
for
help
a
heavy
hand
was
clasped
over
his
mouth
and
strong
arms
subdued
his
show
of
resistance
swiftly
across
a
short
stretch
of
ground
they
went
up
rickety
steps
and
into
the
black
hallway
of
a
house
there
were
stifled
moans
of
terror
on
the
lips
of
the
two
women
but
there
was
no
resistance
save
the
weight
their
strengthless
forms
imposed
upon
the
men
who
had
them
in
charge
there
was
no
light
in
the
house
and
no
sign
that
it
was
occupied
by
others
than
themselves
we
remain
here
for
several
hours
if
all
goes
well
you
will
then
be
at
liberty
to
depart
for
your
home
in
the
city
here
is
a
chair
madam
pray
be
seated
pardon
our
inability
to
give
you
a
light
you
will
be
patient
i
am
sure
when
it
is
said
on
the
sacred
word
of
a
gentleman
that
no
harm
is
to
come
to
you
it
is
only
necessary
that
you
remain
quiet
and
await
the
hour
when
we
are
ready
to
release
you
i
must
ask
permission
to
lock
the
door
of
this
room
before
dawn
your
friends
will
be
here
to
take
you
away
in
safety
everything
has
been
arranged
for
your
personal
welfare
and
comfort
permit
me
to
say
where
are
we
demanded
the
old
man
why
have
you
brought
us
here
asked
garrison
from
the
arm
chair
into
which
she
had
limply
fallen
you
will
learn
everything
in
good
time
we
shall
be
just
outside
the
door
and
will
respond
promptly
if
you
need
our
help
to
the
extent
of
shouting
for
it
in
the
meantime
your
horses
and
carriage
are
being
well
cared
for
be
of
good
heart
and
your
night
will
not
be
a
long
one
believe
me
i
hope
we
may
meet
again
under
more
pleasing
the
door
closed
a
second
later
and
the
key
clicked
then
came
the
shooting
of
a
bolt
a
short
scuffling
of
feet
and
the
silence
of
the
dead
reigned
over
the
strange
house
overcome
with
dread
the
occupants
of
the
room
uttered
no
word
no
sound
for
what
seemed
to
them
an
hour
then
garrison
real
tenderness
in
her
voice
called
softly
to
her
daughter
darling
can
you
find
me
in
this
darkness
come
to
me
let
me
hold
you
close
in
my
arms
dorothy
poor
poor
but
there
was
no
response
to
the
appeal
nor
to
a
second
and
a
third
call
the
mother
sprang
to
her
feet
in
sudden
terror
her
heart
fluttering
wildly
henry
are
you
here
where
is
what
has
happened
to
dorothy
she
cried
a
trembling
old
man
and
a
frantic
woman
bumped
against
each
other
in
the
darkness
and
the
search
began
there
were
but
two
people
in
the
room
following
this
alarming
discovery
one
of
these
persons
swooned
and
the
other
battered
like
a
madman
against
the
heavy
stubborn
door
far
away
in
the
night
bowled
a
carriage
drawn
by
sturdy
horses
the
clouds
broke
and
the
rain
fell
thunder
and
lightning
ran
rampant
in
the
skies
but
nothing
served
to
lessen
the
speed
of
that
swift
flight
over
the
highways
leading
into
the
country
inside
the
cab
not
the
one
in
which
dorothy
garrison
had
begun
her
journey
to
the
altar
but
another
and
less
pretentious
sat
the
grim
desperado
and
a
woman
whither
they
flew
no
one
knew
save
the
man
who
held
the
reins
over
the
plunging
horses
how
long
their
journey
well
it
was
to
have
an
end
true
to
the
promise
made
by
the
bandit
a
clattering
band
of
horsemen
dashed
up
to
the
lonely
house
at
the
break
of
dawn
they
were
led
by
prince
ugo
ravorelli
dishevelled
a
shivering
woman
in
silks
and
a
cowering
old
man
sobbed
with
joy
when
the
rescuers
burst
through
the
door
tacked
to
a
panel
in
the
door
was
an
ominous
paper
on
which
was
printed
the
following
message
from
the
night
just
gone
in
time
the
one
who
is
missing
shall
be
returned
to
the
arms
of
her
mother
absolutely
unharmed
she
will
be
well
cared
for
by
those
who
have
her
in
charge
after
a
reasonable
length
of
time
her
friends
will
be
informed
as
to
the
terms
on
which
she
may
be
restored
to
garrison
more
dead
than
alive
was
conveyed
to
her
home
in
the
avenue
louise
there
to
recover
her
strength
with
astonishing
quickness
this
vastly
purposeful
indomitable
woman
before
many
hours
had
passed
was
calmly
listening
to
plans
for
the
capture
of
her
daring
abductors
and
the
release
of
her
daughter
friends
overcome
with
the
horror
of
the
hour
flocked
to
her
aid
and
comfort
the
government
offered
its
assistance
and
the
police
went
to
work
as
one
massive
newspapers
all
over
the
world
fairly
staggered
under
the
burden
of
news
they
carried
to
their
readers
and
people
everywhere
stood
aghast
at
the
most
audacious
outrage
in
the
annals
of
crime
as
completely
lost
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
them
were
the
diamond
robbers
for
all
the
world
accepted
them
as
the
perpetrators
and
their
fair
prize
no
one
saw
the
carriage
after
it
turned
off
the
avenue
louise
on
the
night
of
the
abduction
no
one
saw
the
party
leave
the
lonely
house
in
the
country
a
placard
found
on
the
steps
of
a
prominent
citizen
home
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
told
the
frenzied
searchers
where
to
look
for
the
mother
and
the
uncle
of
the
missing
girl
a
reward
of
francs
for
the
arrest
of
the
abductors
or
the
return
of
miss
garrison
was
offered
at
once
by
the
woman
in
the
avenue
louise
and
detectives
flew
about
like
bees
every
city
in
the
land
was
warned
to
be
on
the
lookout
every
village
was
watched
every
train
and
station
was
guarded
nine
in
every
ten
detectives
maintained
that
she
was
still
in
brussels
and
house
after
house
mansion
after
mansion
was
searched
three
days
after
the
abduction
word
came
from
london
that
four
men
and
a
young
woman
apparently
insane
all
roughly
attired
had
come
to
that
city
from
ostend
and
had
disappeared
before
the
officials
were
fully
cognizant
of
their
arrival
the
woman
according
to
the
statements
of
men
who
saw
her
on
the
train
was
beautiful
and
pale
as
with
the
sickness
that
promised
death
xxi
the
home
of
the
brigands
it
was
past
midnight
after
a
wild
ride
through
the
storm
when
an
old
gentleman
and
his
wife
with
their
sick
daughter
boarded
a
fast
eastbound
train
at
namur
had
the
officers
of
the
law
known
of
the
abduction
at
that
hour
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
to
discover
that
the
gown
which
enveloped
the
almost
unconscious
partially
veiled
daughter
hid
a
garment
of
silk
so
fine
that
the
whole
world
had
read
columns
concerning
its
beauty
the
gray
beard
of
the
rather
distinguished
old
man
could
have
been
removed
at
a
single
grasp
while
the
wife
also
veiled
wore
the
clothing
of
a
man
underneath
the
skirts
the
father
and
mother
were
all
attention
to
their
unfortunate
child
who
looked
into
their
faces
with
wide
hopeless
eyes
and
uttered
no
word
of
complaint
no
sound
of
pain
at
a
small
station
some
miles
from
the
border
line
of
the
grand
duchy
of
luxemburg
the
party
left
the
coach
and
were
met
by
a
carriage
in
which
they
whirled
away
in
the
darkness
that
comes
just
before
dawn
the
horses
flew
swiftly
toward
the
line
that
separates
belgium
from
the
grand
duchy
and
the
sun
was
barely
above
the
bank
of
trees
on
the
highlands
in
the
east
when
the
carriage
of
the
impetuous
travelers
drew
up
in
front
of
a
picturesque
roadside
inn
just
across
the
boundary
the
horses
were
quickly
stabled
and
the
occupants
of
the
vehicle
were
comfortably
and
safely
quartered
in
a
darkened
room
overlooking
the
highway
so
ill
was
the
daughter
explained
the
father
that
she
was
not
to
be
disturbed
on
any
account
or
pretext
fatigued
by
the
long
ride
from
their
home
in
the
north
she
was
unable
to
continue
the
journey
to
luxemburg
until
she
had
had
a
day
of
rest
at
the
big
city
she
was
to
be
placed
in
the
care
of
the
most
noted
of
surgeons
full
of
compassion
the
keeper
of
the
inn
and
his
good
wife
did
all
in
their
power
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
the
distressed
father
particularly
as
he
was
free
with
his
purse
it
did
not
strike
them
as
peculiar
that
the
coachman
remained
at
the
stable
closely
and
that
early
in
the
day
his
horses
were
attached
to
the
carriage
as
if
ready
for
a
start
on
the
notice
of
a
moment
the
good
man
and
his
wife
and
the
few
peasants
who
were
told
of
the
suffering
guest
in
order
that
they
might
talk
in
lowered
voices
and
refrain
from
disturbing
noises
did
not
know
that
the
mother
of
the
girl
sat
behind
the
curtains
of
an
upstairs
window
watching
the
road
in
both
directions
a
revolver
on
the
sill
the
fact
that
the
strange
party
decided
to
depart
for
luxemburg
just
before
nightfall
did
not
create
surprise
in
their
simple
breasts
for
had
not
the
anxious
father
said
they
would
start
as
soon
as
his
daughter
felt
equal
to
the
journey
so
eager
were
they
to
deliver
her
over
to
the
great
doctor
who
alone
could
save
her
life
with
a
crack
of
the
whip
and
a
gruff
shout
of
farewell
to
the
gaping
stableboy
who
had
been
his
companion
for
a
day
the
driver
of
the
early
morning
coach
whirled
into
the
road
and
off
toward
the
city
of
precipices
no
one
about
the
inn
knew
who
the
brief
sojourners
were
nor
did
they
know
whence
they
came
the
stableboy
noted
the
letter
s
blazoned
on
the
blinds
of
the
horses
bridles
but
there
were
no
letters
on
the
carriage
there
had
been
but
there
was
evidence
that
they
had
been
unskillfully
removed
late
in
the
night
the
coachman
pulled
rein
and
a
man
on
horseback
rode
up
opened
the
door
and
softly
inquired
after
the
welfare
of
the
occupants
with
a
command
to
follow
he
rode
away
through
a
narrow
uncertain
wagon
path
when
the
way
became
rough
and
dangerous
he
dismounted
and
climbed
to
the
boot
of
the
cab
the
coachman
going
to
the
empty
saddle
half
an
hour
later
the
new
coachman
stopped
the
puffing
horses
in
front
of
a
great
black
shadow
from
which
here
and
there
lights
beamed
cheerfully
from
the
back
of
the
vehicle
the
two
men
unstrapped
the
heavy
steamer
trunk
which
had
come
all
the
way
from
brussels
with
the
party
and
then
the
doors
of
the
big
shadow
opened
and
closed
behind
dorothy
garrison
and
her
captors
so
skillfully
and
so
audaciously
were
the
plans
of
the
abductors
carried
out
that
when
miss
garrison
entered
a
room
set
apart
for
her
in
the
great
house
after
passing
through
long
grotesque
and
corridors
she
found
an
open
trunk
full
of
garments
she
had
expected
to
wear
on
her
wedding
journey
a
trim
and
pretty
english
maid
entered
the
room
the
instant
it
was
vacated
by
the
man
and
the
tall
person
who
had
posed
as
his
wife
while
dorothy
sat
like
a
statue
gazing
upon
her
the
young
woman
lighted
other
candles
in
the
apartment
and
then
came
to
the
side
of
the
mute
wretched
newcomer
will
you
let
me
prepare
you
for
bed
miss
it
is
very
late
and
you
must
be
tired
would
you
like
anything
to
eat
before
retiring
she
asked
as
quietly
as
if
she
had
been
in
her
service
forever
in
heaven
name
where
am
i
tell
me
what
does
it
all
mean
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
me
cried
dorothy
hoarsely
clutching
the
girl
hand
you
could
not
be
in
safer
hands
miss
garrison
said
the
maid
kindly
i
am
here
to
do
all
that
is
your
all
then
i
implore
you
to
aid
me
in
getting
from
began
dorothy
excitedly
coming
to
her
unsteady
feet
i
am
loyal
to
others
as
well
as
to
you
interposed
the
maid
firmly
you
will
find
that
but
there
i
must
say
no
more
your
bedchamber
is
off
here
miss
you
will
let
me
prepare
you
for
the
sleep
you
need
so
much
no
harm
can
come
to
you
dorothy
suddenly
felt
her
courage
returning
her
brain
began
to
busy
itself
with
hopes
prospects
plans
after
all
they
could
not
would
not
kill
her
she
was
too
valuable
to
them
there
was
the
chance
of
escape
and
new
strength
in
the
belief
that
she
could
in
some
way
outwit
them
there
was
a
vast
difference
between
the
woman
who
suffered
herself
to
be
put
to
bed
by
the
deft
kindly
maid
and
the
one
who
dragged
herself
hopelessly
into
the
room
such
a
short
time
before
with
the
growth
of
hope
and
determination
there
came
the
courage
to
inspect
her
surroundings
the
rooms
were
charming
there
was
a
generous
kindly
warmth
about
them
that
suggested
luxury
refinement
and
the
hand
of
a
connoiseur
the
rugs
were
of
rare
quality
the
furnishings
elegant
the
appointments
modern
and
complete
she
could
not
suppress
a
long
breath
of
surprise
and
relief
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
convince
herself
that
she
was
not
in
some
fastidious
english
home
despite
the
fearful
journey
ending
in
the
perilous
ascent
over
rocks
and
gullies
she
felt
herself
glowing
with
the
belief
that
she
was
still
in
brussels
or
at
the
worst
in
liege
her
amazement
on
finding
her
own
trunk
and
the
garments
she
had
left
in
her
chamber
the
night
before
was
so
great
that
her
troubled
bewildered
mind
raced
back
to
the
days
when
she
marvelled
over
aladdin
wonderful
lamp
and
the
genii
how
could
they
have
secured
her
dresses
but
how
could
anything
be
impossible
to
these
masters
in
crime
once
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
dark
windows
a
wistful
eager
expression
came
into
them
the
maid
observed
the
look
and
smiled
it
is
fully
fifty
feet
to
the
ground
she
said
simply
miss
garrison
sighed
and
then
smiled
resignedly
worn
out
in
body
and
mind
she
sank
into
sleep
even
while
the
mighty
daring
resolve
to
rush
over
and
throw
herself
from
the
window
was
framing
itself
in
her
brain
the
resolve
was
made
suddenly
considered
briefly
and
would
have
been
acted
on
precipitously
had
not
the
drowsy
lazy
influence
of
slumber
bade
her
to
wait
a
minute
then
another
minute
another
and
another
and
then
to
forget
sunlight
streamed
into
the
room
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
in
a
state
of
uncanny
perplexity
where
was
she
in
whose
bed
then
she
remembered
with
the
swiftness
of
a
cat
she
left
the
bed
and
flew
to
the
window
to
look
out
upon
space
at
first
then
the
trees
and
rocks
below
the
ground
seemed
a
mile
below
the
spot
on
which
she
stood
gasping
with
dread
she
shrank
back
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
tense
fingers
are
you
ready
for
me
miss
asked
a
soft
voice
from
somewhere
and
dorothy
whirled
to
face
the
maid
her
throat
choked
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
the
reawakening
her
heart
throbbed
so
faintly
that
her
hand
went
forth
to
find
support
the
little
maid
put
her
strong
gentle
arm
about
the
trembling
girl
and
drew
her
again
to
the
bed
they
are
expecting
you
down
to
breakfast
but
i
was
instructed
not
to
hurry
you
to
breakfast
gasped
dorothy
staring
at
the
girl
as
if
her
eyes
would
pop
out
wha
what
the
impudence
but
you
must
eat
you
with
with
these
despicable
wretches
never
i
will
starve
first
go
away
from
me
i
do
not
need
you
i
want
to
be
alone
absolutely
alone
do
you
hear
she
violently
shoved
the
girl
away
from
her
but
the
friendly
smile
did
not
leave
the
latter
face
when
you
need
me
miss
i
am
in
the
next
room
she
said
calmly
and
was
gone
anger
pure
and
simple
brought
sobs
from
the
very
heart
of
the
girl
who
lay
face
downward
on
the
crumpled
bed
a
new
impulse
inspired
her
to
call
sharply
to
the
maid
and
a
moment
later
she
was
hastily
nervously
defiantly
preparing
herself
to
face
the
enemy
and
breakfast
tingling
with
some
trepidation
and
some
impatience
she
led
the
maid
through
a
strenuous
what
with
questions
commands
implorings
reprimands
complaints
and
fault
findings
the
poor
girl
had
a
sad
time
of
it
when
at
last
miss
garrison
stood
ready
to
descend
upon
the
foe
she
was
the
picture
of
defiance
with
a
steady
stride
she
followed
the
maid
to
the
door
just
as
it
was
opened
a
strong
rollicking
baritone
voice
came
ringing
through
the
halls
attuned
in
song
in
the
days
of
old
when
knights
were
bold
and
barons
held
their
sway
etc
dorothy
stopped
stockstill
in
the
doorway
completely
overwhelmed
she
turned
helplessly
to
the
maid
tried
to
gasp
the
question
that
filled
her
mind
and
then
leaned
weakly
against
the
wall
the
singer
voice
grew
suddenly
fainter
with
the
slam
of
a
door
and
while
its
music
could
still
be
heard
distinctly
she
knew
that
he
of
the
merry
tones
had
left
the
lower
hallway
feebly
she
began
to
wonder
what
manner
of
men
these
thieves
could
be
these
miscreants
who
lived
in
a
castle
who
had
lady
maids
about
them
who
sang
in
cheery
tones
and
who
knew
neither
fear
nor
caution
one
of
the
new
guests
who
came
last
night
explained
the
maid
unconcernedly
one
who
came
who
came
with
me
o
how
can
such
a
wretch
sing
so
gayly
have
they
been
drinking
all
night
cried
dorothy
shrinking
back
into
the
room
lor
no
miss
there
ca
be
any
such
goings
on
as
that
here
i
think
they
are
waiting
for
you
in
the
breakfast
room
said
the
girl
starting
down
the
broad
steps
i
sooner
die
than
venture
among
those
ruffians
but
the
ladies
are
expecting
ladies
here
gasped
dorothy
yes
miss
why
not
dorothy
head
whirled
again
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
she
glanced
down
at
her
morning
gown
her
mind
slowly
going
back
to
the
glittering
costume
she
had
worn
the
night
before
was
it
all
a
dream
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
she
followed
the
girl
down
the
steps
utterly
without
purpose
drawn
as
by
some
strange
subtle
force
to
the
terminal
point
in
the
mystery
through
the
hall
she
passed
with
heart
throbbing
wildly
expecting
she
knew
not
what
her
emotions
as
she
approached
the
door
she
could
have
never
told
so
tumultuously
were
they
surging
one
upon
the
other
the
maid
grasped
the
huge
knob
and
swung
wide
the
door
from
whose
threshold
she
was
to
look
upon
a
picture
that
would
linger
in
her
mind
to
the
end
of
time
a
great
sunlit
room
a
long
table
and
flemish
chairs
a
bewildering
group
of
men
and
women
a
chorus
of
friendly
voices
and
then
familiar
faces
began
to
stand
out
plainly
before
her
eyes
lady
saxondale
was
advancing
toward
the
door
with
outstretched
hands
and
smiling
face
over
her
shoulder
the
dumbfounded
girl
saw
lady
jane
oldham
saxondale
happy
faced
dickey
savage
and
philip
quentin
xxii
castle
craneycrow
dorothy
staggered
into
the
arms
of
lady
saxondale
choking
with
a
joy
that
knew
no
bounds
stupefied
past
all
power
of
understanding
she
only
saw
and
knew
that
she
was
safe
that
some
strange
miracle
had
been
wrought
and
that
there
were
no
terrible
robbers
in
sight
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
utter
a
word
to
those
who
stood
about
eagerly
anxiously
watching
the
play
of
emotions
in
her
face
o
you
will
never
know
how
glorious
you
all
look
to
me
how
is
it
that
i
am
here
where
are
those
awful
men
what
has
happened
to
me
lady
saxondale
tell
me
i
can
not
breathe
till
everything
is
explained
to
me
she
cried
her
voice
trembling
with
gladness
in
her
vast
exuberance
she
found
strength
and
with
it
the
desire
to
embrace
all
these
good
friends
her
ecstatic
exhibition
of
joy
lost
its
violence
after
she
had
kissed
and
half
crushed
lady
jane
and
had
grasped
both
of
lord
bob
big
hands
convulsively
the
young
men
came
in
for
a
much
more
formal
and
decorous
greeting
for
an
instant
she
found
herself
looking
into
quentin
eyes
as
he
clasped
her
hand
and
there
was
a
strange
light
in
them
a
bright
eager
victorious
gleam
which
puzzled
her
not
a
little
o
tell
me
all
about
it
please
do
i
been
through
such
a
terrible
experience
can
it
be
true
that
i
am
really
here
with
you
you
certainly
are
my
dear
said
lady
saxondale
smiling
at
her
then
glancing
involuntarily
into
the
faces
of
the
others
a
queer
expression
in
her
eyes
where
is
mamma
i
must
go
to
her
at
once
lady
saxondale
the
wretches
were
so
cruel
to
her
and
to
poor
uncle
henry
good
heavens
tell
me
they
did
not
did
not
kill
her
she
clutched
at
the
back
of
a
chair
and
grasped
quentin
arm
as
it
swept
forward
to
keep
her
from
falling
your
mother
is
safe
and
well
cried
lady
saxondale
quickly
she
is
in
brussels
however
and
not
here
and
where
am
i
are
you
telling
the
truth
is
she
truly
safe
and
well
then
why
is
she
here
she
cried
uneasily
apprehensively
it
takes
a
long
story
miss
garrison
said
lord
bob
soberly
i
think
you
would
better
wait
till
after
breakfast
for
the
full
story
so
far
as
it
is
known
to
us
you
feel
better
and
i
know
you
must
be
as
hungry
as
a
there
was
a
troubled
uncertain
pucker
to
her
brow
a
pleading
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
suffered
herself
to
be
led
to
a
chair
near
the
end
of
the
table
it
had
not
struck
her
as
odd
that
the
others
were
deplorably
devoid
of
the
fervor
that
should
have
manifested
itself
in
words
at
least
there
was
an
air
of
restraint
almost
oppressive
but
she
failed
to
see
it
and
it
was
not
long
until
it
was
so
cleverly
succeeded
by
a
genial
warmth
of
manner
that
she
never
knew
the
severity
of
the
strain
upon
the
spirits
of
that
small
company
suddenly
she
half
started
from
the
chair
her
gaze
fastened
on
quentin
face
he
read
the
question
in
her
eyes
and
answered
before
she
could
frame
it
into
words
i
did
not
sail
for
new
york
at
all
he
said
with
an
assumption
of
ease
he
did
not
feel
dickey
and
i
accepted
lord
pressing
invitation
to
stop
off
with
them
for
awhile
i
do
wonder
that
you
are
surprised
to
find
us
i
am
not
surprised
at
anything
now
she
said
in
perplexed
tones
but
we
are
not
in
england
we
were
not
on
the
water
and
all
those
trees
and
hills
and
rocks
i
saw
from
the
window
where
are
we
in
the
grimmest
feudliest
ghastliest
old
place
between
brussels
and
anthony
hope
domain
this
is
castle
craneycrow
a
real
live
castle
with
parapets
bastions
traditions
and
i
insist
though
they
wo
believe
me
snakes
and
mice
and
winged
things
that
screech
and
so
spoke
lady
jane
eagerly
miss
garrison
was
forgetting
to
eat
in
her
wonder
and
savage
was
obliged
to
remind
her
that
things
get
cold
mighty
quick
in
these
baronial
i
know
it
a
castle
but
where
is
it
located
and
how
came
you
here
that
it
quoth
savage
serenely
how
came
we
here
i
repeat
the
question
and
supply
the
answer
we
came
by
the
grace
of
god
and
more
or
less
o
i
never
understand
it
at
all
complained
dorothy
in
despair
now
you
must
answer
my
questions
one
by
one
lord
saxondale
to
whom
does
the
castle
belong
to
the
earl
of
saxondale
then
i
know
where
it
is
this
is
the
old
place
in
luxemburg
you
were
telling
me
that
is
a
question
but
you
are
but
how
is
it
that
i
am
here
you
can
answer
that
question
better
than
i
miss
i
only
know
those
wretches
the
one
who
disguised
himself
as
my
father
and
the
one
who
tried
to
be
my
mother
jostled
me
till
i
was
half
dead
and
stopped
eventually
at
the
doors
o
o
o
she
broke
off
in
startled
tones
dropping
her
fork
they
they
did
not
really
bring
me
here
to
your
house
did
they
they
were
good
enough
to
turn
you
over
to
our
keeping
last
night
and
we
are
overjoyed
to
have
you
then
she
exclaimed
tragically
rising
to
her
feet
where
are
the
men
who
brought
me
here
a
peculiar
and
rather
mirthless
smile
passed
from
one
to
the
other
of
her
companions
and
it
angered
her
i
demand
an
explanation
lord
i
can
give
none
miss
garrison
upon
my
soul
it
is
very
far
from
clear
to
me
you
were
brought
to
my
doors
last
night
and
i
pledge
myself
to
protect
you
with
my
life
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
here
and
at
the
proper
time
i
am
sure
everything
will
be
made
clear
to
you
and
you
will
be
satisfied
believe
me
you
are
among
your
dearest
friends
dearest
friends
she
cried
bitterly
you
insult
me
by
running
away
from
my
wedding
you
league
yourselves
with
the
fiends
who
committed
the
worst
outrage
that
men
ever
conceived
and
now
you
hold
me
here
a
a
prisoner
yes
a
prisoner
i
do
not
forget
the
words
of
the
maid
who
attended
me
i
do
not
forget
the
inexplicable
presence
of
my
traveling
clothes
in
this
house
and
i
shall
never
forget
that
my
abductors
came
direct
to
your
castle
wherever
it
may
be
do
you
mean
to
say
that
they
brought
me
here
without
an
understanding
with
you
oh
i
see
it
all
now
you
you
perpetrated
this
outrage
on
the
contrary
miss
garrison
i
am
the
meekest
and
lowliest
of
english
squires
and
i
am
in
no
way
leagued
with
a
band
of
robbers
perhaps
if
you
will
wait
a
little
while
lady
saxondale
may
throw
some
light
on
the
mystery
that
puzzles
you
you
surely
will
trust
lady
lady
saxondale
did
me
the
honor
to
command
me
to
give
up
prince
ravorelli
i
am
not
married
to
him
and
i
am
here
in
her
home
a
prisoner
said
dorothy
scornfully
i
do
not
understand
why
i
am
here
and
i
do
not
know
that
you
are
my
friends
everything
is
so
queer
so
extraordinary
that
i
do
know
how
to
feel
toward
you
when
you
satisfactorily
explain
it
all
to
me
i
may
be
able
to
forget
the
feeling
i
have
for
you
now
and
once
more
regard
you
as
friends
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
i
am
not
to
have
the
privilege
of
quitting
the
castle
without
your
consent
i
acknowledge
myself
a
prisoner
and
await
your
pleasure
you
will
find
me
in
the
room
to
which
you
sent
me
last
night
i
can
not
sit
at
your
table
feeling
that
you
are
not
my
friends
i
should
choke
with
every
no
one
sought
to
bar
her
way
from
the
perhaps
no
one
there
felt
equal
to
the
task
of
explaining
on
the
moment
the
intricacies
of
a
very
unusual
transaction
for
no
one
had
quite
expected
the
bolt
to
fall
so
sharply
she
paced
the
floor
of
her
room
angrily
bewailing
the
fate
that
brought
her
to
this
fortress
among
the
rocks
time
after
time
she
paused
at
the
lofty
windows
to
look
upon
the
trees
the
little
river
and
the
white
roadbed
far
below
there
was
no
escape
from
this
isolated
pile
of
stone
she
was
confined
as
were
bluebeard
victims
in
the
days
of
giants
and
ogres
and
there
were
no
fairy
queens
to
break
down
the
walls
and
set
her
free
each
thought
left
the
deeper
certainty
that
the
people
in
the
room
below
were
banded
against
her
an
hour
later
lady
saxondale
found
her
her
flushed
face
pressed
to
the
window
pane
that
looked
down
upon
the
world
as
if
out
of
the
sky
i
suppose
lady
saxondale
you
are
come
to
assure
me
again
that
i
am
perfectly
safe
in
your
castle
said
the
prisoner
turning
at
the
sound
of
her
ladyship
voice
i
have
come
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
from
your
wedding
to
the
present
moment
nothing
is
to
be
hidden
from
you
my
dear
miss
garrison
you
may
not
now
consider
us
your
friends
but
some
day
you
will
look
back
and
be
thankful
we
took
such
desperate
dangerous
means
to
protect
you
said
lady
saxondale
coming
to
the
window
dorothy
eyes
were
upon
the
outside
world
and
they
were
dark
and
rebellious
the
older
woman
complacently
stationed
herself
beside
the
girl
and
for
a
few
moments
neither
spoke
i
am
ready
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
came
at
last
from
miss
garrison
it
is
not
necessary
to
inform
you
that
you
were
abducted
not
in
the
least
the
memory
of
the
past
two
days
is
vivid
enough
said
miss
garrison
with
cutting
irony
in
her
voice
but
it
may
interest
you
to
know
the
names
of
your
abductors
said
the
other
calmly
i
could
not
miss
them
far
in
guessing
lady
it
was
necessary
for
some
one
to
deliver
you
from
the
villain
you
were
to
marry
by
the
most
effective
process
there
is
but
one
person
in
all
this
world
who
cares
enough
for
you
to
undertake
the
stupendous
risk
your
abduction
incurred
you
need
not
be
told
his
you
mean
said
dorothy
scarcely
above
a
whisper
that
philip
quentin
planned
and
executed
this
crime
lady
saxondale
nodded
and
i
am
his
prisoner
breathlessly
you
are
under
his
protection
that
is
do
you
call
it
protection
to
began
dorothy
her
eyes
blazing
but
lady
saxondale
interrupted
firmly
you
are
his
prisoner
then
and
we
are
your
jailers
have
it
as
you
lady
saxondale
proceeded
to
relate
the
history
of
philip
achievement
instead
of
sailing
for
new
york
he
surrendered
to
his
overpowering
love
and
fell
to
work
perfecting
the
preposterous
plan
that
had
come
to
him
as
a
vision
in
the
final
hour
of
despair
there
was
but
little
time
in
which
to
act
and
there
was
stubborn
opposition
to
fight
against
the
saxondales
were
the
only
persons
to
whom
he
could
turn
and
not
until
after
he
had
fairly
fought
them
to
earth
did
they
consent
to
aid
him
in
the
undertaking
there
remained
to
perform
then
the
crowning
act
in
this
apparently
insane
transaction
the
stealing
of
a
woman
on
whom
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
seemed
riveted
was
a
task
that
might
well
confound
the
strategy
of
the
most
skillful
general
but
it
did
not
worry
the
determined
american
wisely
he
chose
the
wedding
day
as
the
best
on
which
to
carry
out
his
project
the
that
would
follow
the
nonappearance
of
the
bride
would
throw
the
populace
and
the
authorities
into
a
state
of
confusion
that
might
last
for
hours
before
they
could
settle
down
to
a
systematic
search
the
bold
operator
would
be
safely
in
the
last
place
they
would
suspect
an
english
lord
playhouse
in
the
valley
of
the
alzette
nothing
but
the
most
audacious
daring
could
hope
to
win
in
such
an
undertaking
when
coachman
and
footman
came
forth
in
all
their
august
splendor
on
the
night
of
the
wedding
they
were
pounced
upon
by
three
men
overpowered
bound
and
locked
in
a
small
room
in
the
stables
one
of
the
desperadoes
calmly
approached
the
servants
quarters
presented
a
bold
face
covered
with
whiskers
and
said
he
had
come
for
miss
garrison
trunks
almost
insane
with
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
the
servants
not
only
escorted
him
to
the
bride
room
but
assisted
him
in
carrying
two
trunks
downstairs
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
ascertain
which
trunk
was
most
needed
and
it
was
thrown
into
a
buggy
and
driven
away
by
one
of
the
trio
when
the
carriage
stopped
for
the
first
time
to
permit
the
masked
man
to
thrust
his
revolver
into
the
faces
of
the
occupants
the
trunk
was
jerked
from
that
same
buggy
and
thrown
to
the
boot
of
the
larger
vehicle
of
course
having
absolute
control
of
the
carriage
it
was
no
trick
if
luck
attended
for
the
new
coachman
and
footman
to
drive
away
with
the
unsuspecting
bride
and
her
companions
it
is
only
the
ridiculously
improbable
projects
that
are
successful
it
has
been
said
certainly
it
was
proven
in
this
case
it
is
not
necessary
to
tell
the
full
story
except
to
say
that
the
masked
man
who
appeared
at
the
carriage
door
in
the
little
side
street
was
quentin
that
the
was
dickey
savage
the
driver
turk
in
the
exchange
of
clothing
with
the
deposed
servants
of
garrison
however
turk
fell
into
a
suit
of
livery
big
enough
for
two
men
of
his
stature
the
deserted
house
was
beyond
the
city
limits
and
had
been
located
the
day
before
by
turk
whose
joy
in
being
connected
with
such
a
game
was
boundless
other
disguises
carefully
chosen
helped
them
on
to
the
grand
duchy
quentin
as
the
man
savage
as
the
old
woman
the
suffering
of
dorothy
garrison
during
that
wild
night
and
day
was
the
only
thing
that
wrung
blood
from
the
consciences
of
these
ruthless
philip
quentin
it
must
be
said
lived
years
of
agony
and
remorse
while
carrying
out
his
part
of
the
plan
how
the
plot
was
carried
to
the
stage
where
it
became
lady
saxondale
duty
to
acquaint
dorothy
garrison
with
the
full
particulars
the
reader
knows
it
only
remains
to
say
that
good
fortune
favored
the
conspirators
at
every
turn
and
that
they
covered
their
tracks
with
amazing
effectiveness
utterly
cut
off
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
captive
found
herself
powerless
to
communicate
with
the
hysterical
people
who
were
seeking
her
in
every
spot
save
the
right
one
now
that
you
have
finished
this
remarkable
story
and
have
pleaded
so
prettily
for
him
may
i
ask
just
what
quentin
expects
of
me
asked
dorothy
cold
calm
and
entirely
the
mistress
of
herself
and
the
million
emotions
that
lady
saxondale
disclosures
aroused
he
expects
you
to
give
him
your
heart
said
her
ladyship
slowly
dorothy
fell
back
against
the
wall
aghast
overcome
by
this
crowning
piece
of
audacity
dorothy
a
week
ago
you
loved
phil
quentin
even
when
you
stepped
inside
the
carriage
that
was
to
take
you
to
the
altar
you
loved
him
better
i
did
not
i
hate
him
cried
dorothy
perhaps
now
but
let
me
ask
you
this
question
when
you
were
being
dragged
away
by
those
three
men
when
they
were
putting
miles
and
miles
between
you
and
your
friends
of
whom
were
you
thinking
ah
your
face
your
eyes
betray
you
you
were
thinking
of
philip
quentin
not
of
ugo
ravorelli
you
were
praying
that
one
strong
arm
might
come
to
your
relief
you
knew
but
one
man
in
all
the
world
who
had
the
courage
the
love
the
power
to
rescue
you
last
night
when
you
entered
this
dismal
place
you
wondered
if
philip
quentin
yes
philip
quentin
could
break
down
the
doors
and
save
you
and
then
you
remembered
that
he
could
not
help
you
for
you
had
thrown
aside
his
love
had
driven
him
away
listen
do
deny
it
for
i
am
a
woman
and
i
know
this
morning
you
looked
from
yon
window
and
your
heart
sank
with
despair
then
forgetful
again
your
eye
swept
the
road
in
the
hope
of
seeing
of
seeing
whom
but
one
man
was
in
your
mind
dorothy
garrison
and
he
was
on
the
ocean
when
you
came
into
the
breakfast
room
whose
face
was
it
that
sent
the
thrill
to
your
heart
whose
presence
was
it
that
told
you
your
prayers
had
been
answered
whom
did
you
look
upon
as
your
savior
your
rescuer
that
big
american
who
loves
you
better
than
life
philip
quentin
had
saved
you
from
the
brigands
and
you
loved
him
for
it
now
dorothy
garrison
you
hate
him
because
he
saved
you
from
a
worse
fate
marriage
with
the
most
dissolute
hypocrite
in
europe
the
most
cunning
of
all
adventurers
you
are
not
trying
to
check
the
tears
that
blind
your
eyes
but
you
will
not
confess
to
me
that
your
tears
come
from
a
heart
full
of
belief
in
the
man
who
loves
you
deeply
enough
to
risk
his
honor
and
his
life
to
save
you
from
endless
misery
lie
where
you
are
on
this
couch
dorothy
and
just
think
of
it
all
think
of
when
dorothy
raised
her
wet
eyes
from
the
cushion
in
which
they
had
been
buried
lady
saxondale
was
gone
philip
quentin
stood
in
the
doorway
xxiii
his
only
in
an
instant
she
was
on
her
feet
and
struggling
to
suppress
the
sobs
that
had
been
wrung
from
her
by
the
words
of
lady
saxondale
dorothy
said
quentin
his
voice
tender
and
pleading
you
have
heard
what
lady
saxondale
had
to
say
she
was
now
standing
at
the
window
her
back
to
him
her
figure
straight
and
defiant
her
hands
clenched
in
the
desperate
effort
to
regain
her
composure
yes
she
responded
hoarsely
i
have
not
come
to
ask
your
pardon
for
my
action
but
to
implore
you
to
withhold
judgment
against
the
others
i
alone
am
to
blame
they
are
as
loyal
to
you
as
they
have
been
to
me
whatever
hatred
you
may
have
in
your
heart
i
deserve
it
spare
the
others
a
single
reproach
for
they
were
won
to
my
cause
only
after
i
had
convinced
them
that
they
were
serving
you
not
me
you
are
with
true
friends
the
best
that
man
or
woman
could
have
i
have
not
come
to
make
any
appeal
for
myself
there
will
be
time
enough
for
that
later
on
when
you
have
come
to
realize
what
your
deliverance
she
faced
him
slowly
a
steady
calm
in
her
face
a
soft
intensity
in
her
voice
you
need
not
hope
that
i
shall
forgive
this
outrage
ever
as
long
as
i
live
you
may
have
had
motives
which
from
your
point
of
view
were
good
and
justifiable
but
you
must
not
expect
me
to
agree
with
you
you
have
done
something
that
no
love
on
earth
could
obliterate
you
have
robbed
my
memory
of
a
sweet
confidence
of
the
one
glorious
thing
that
made
me
look
upon
you
as
the
best
of
men
your
nobility
i
recognize
you
as
the
leader
in
this
cowardly
conspiracy
but
what
must
i
think
of
these
willing
tools
you
plead
for
are
they
entitled
to
my
respect
any
more
than
you
i
am
in
your
power
you
can
and
will
do
with
me
as
you
like
but
you
can
not
compel
me
to
alter
that
over
which
i
have
no
control
my
reason
oh
how
could
you
do
this
dreadful
thing
phil
she
cried
suddenly
casting
the
forced
reserve
to
the
winds
and
relapsing
into
a
very
undignified
appeal
he
smiled
wearily
and
met
her
gaze
with
one
in
which
no
irresolution
flickered
it
was
my
only
way
he
said
at
last
the
only
way
she
exclaimed
there
was
but
one
way
and
i
had
commanded
you
to
take
it
do
you
expect
to
justify
yourself
by
saying
it
was
the
way
to
drag
me
from
my
mother
to
destroy
every
vestige
of
confidence
i
had
in
you
to
make
me
the
most
woman
in
europe
was
that
the
way
what
are
they
doing
and
saying
of
what
are
the
newspapers
talking
under
those
horrid
headlines
what
are
the
police
the
detectives
the
gossips
doing
i
am
the
object
on
which
their
every
thought
is
centered
oh
it
is
maddening
to
think
of
what
you
of
all
people
have
heaped
upon
me
she
paced
the
floor
like
one
bereft
of
reason
his
heart
smote
him
as
he
saw
the
anguish
he
had
brought
into
the
soul
of
the
girl
he
loved
better
than
everything
and
my
poor
mother
what
of
her
have
you
no
pity
no
heart
you
see
that
it
will
kill
her
for
god
sake
let
me
go
back
to
her
phil
be
merciful
she
cried
she
is
safe
and
well
dorothy
i
swear
it
on
my
soul
true
she
suffers
but
it
is
better
she
should
suffer
now
and
find
joy
afterward
than
to
see
you
suffer
for
a
lifetime
you
would
not
listen
to
me
when
i
told
you
the
man
you
were
to
marry
was
a
scoundrel
there
was
but
one
way
to
save
you
from
him
and
from
yourself
there
was
but
one
way
to
save
you
for
myself
and
i
took
it
i
could
not
and
would
not
give
you
up
to
that
villain
i
love
you
dorothy
you
can
not
doubt
that
even
though
you
hate
me
for
proving
it
to
you
everything
have
i
dared
to
save
you
and
to
win
you
to
make
you
gladly
say
some
day
that
you
love
her
eyes
blazed
with
scorn
love
you
after
what
you
have
done
oh
that
i
could
find
words
to
tell
you
how
i
hate
you
she
stopped
in
front
of
him
her
white
face
and
gleaming
eyes
almost
on
a
level
with
his
and
he
could
not
but
quail
before
the
bitter
loathing
that
revealed
itself
so
plainly
involuntarily
his
hand
went
forth
in
supplication
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
came
straight
from
the
depths
into
which
despair
had
cast
him
if
she
saw
the
pain
in
his
face
her
outraged
sensibilities
refused
to
recognize
it
dorothy
you
you
he
began
but
pulled
himself
together
quickly
i
did
not
come
in
the
hope
of
making
you
look
at
things
through
my
eyes
it
is
my
mission
to
acknowledge
as
true
all
that
lady
saxondale
has
told
you
concerning
my
culpability
i
alone
am
guilty
of
wrong
and
i
am
accountable
if
we
are
found
out
i
have
planned
carefully
to
protect
my
friends
yet
a
great
deal
rests
with
you
when
the
law
comes
to
drag
me
from
this
place
its
officers
will
find
me
alone
with
you
here
as
my
accuser
my
friends
will
have
escaped
they
are
your
friends
as
well
as
mine
you
will
do
them
thejustice
of
accusing
but
me
for
i
alone
am
the
you
assume
a
great
deal
when
you
dictate
what
i
am
to
do
and
to
say
if
i
have
the
opportunity
they
are
as
guilty
as
you
and
without
an
incentive
do
you
imagine
that
i
shall
shield
them
i
have
no
more
love
for
them
than
i
have
for
you
not
half
the
respect
for
you
at
least
have
been
consistent
will
you
answer
one
question
how
long
do
you
purpose
to
keep
me
in
this
place
until
you
of
your
own
free
will
can
utter
three
simple
and
those
words
i
love
then
she
said
slowly
decisively
i
am
doomed
to
remain
here
until
death
releases
yes
the
death
of
she
turned
from
him
with
a
bitter
laugh
seating
herself
in
a
chair
near
the
window
looking
up
into
his
face
she
said
with
maddening
submission
i
presume
your
daily
visits
are
to
be
a
part
of
the
torture
i
am
to
endure
his
smile
as
he
shook
his
head
in
response
incensed
her
to
the
point
of
tears
and
she
was
vastly
relieved
when
he
turned
abruptly
and
left
the
apartment
when
the
maid
came
in
she
found
miss
garrison
asleep
on
the
couch
her
cheeks
stained
with
tears
tired
despairing
angry
she
had
found
forgetfulness
for
the
while
sleep
sat
lightly
upon
her
troubled
brain
however
for
the
almost
noiseless
movements
of
the
maid
awakened
her
and
she
sat
up
with
a
start
oh
it
is
you
she
said
after
a
moment
what
is
your
name
baker
the
captive
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
and
for
many
minutes
watched
through
narrow
eyes
the
movements
of
the
servant
a
plan
was
growing
in
her
brain
and
she
was
contemplating
the
situation
in
a
new
and
determined
frame
of
mind
baker
she
said
finally
come
the
maid
stood
before
her
attentively
would
you
like
to
earn
a
thousand
pounds
without
the
faintest
show
of
emotion
the
least
symptom
of
eagerness
baker
answered
in
the
affirmative
then
you
have
but
to
serve
me
as
i
command
and
the
money
is
i
have
already
been
instructed
to
serve
you
i
do
mean
for
you
to
dress
my
hair
and
to
fasten
my
gown
and
all
that
get
me
out
of
this
place
and
to
my
friends
that
is
what
i
mean
whispered
dorothy
eagerly
you
want
to
buy
me
miss
said
baker
calmly
not
that
quite
baker
but
just
you
will
not
think
badly
of
me
if
i
can
not
listen
to
your
offer
miss
i
am
to
serve
you
here
and
i
want
you
to
like
me
but
i
can
not
do
what
you
would
ask
pardon
me
if
i
speak
plainly
but
i
can
not
be
there
was
no
mistaking
the
honest
expression
in
the
maid
eyes
lady
saxondale
is
my
mistress
and
i
love
her
if
she
asks
me
to
take
you
to
your
friends
i
will
dorothy
lips
parted
and
a
look
of
incredulity
grew
in
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
stared
with
unconcealed
wonder
upon
this
unusual
girl
and
then
wonder
slowly
changed
to
admiration
would
that
all
maids
were
as
loyal
baker
lady
saxondale
trusts
you
and
so
shall
but
wonder
again
manifesting
itself
i
can
not
understand
such
fidelity
not
for
no
miss
thank
you
respectfully
and
firmly
ask
lady
saxondale
if
i
may
come
to
the
maid
departed
and
soon
returned
to
say
that
lady
saxondale
would
gladly
see
her
dorothy
followed
her
down
the
long
dark
hall
and
into
the
boudoir
of
castle
craneycrow
mistress
lady
jane
sat
on
the
broad
window
seat
looking
pensively
out
at
the
blue
sky
there
was
in
the
room
such
an
air
of
absolute
peace
and
security
that
dorothy
heart
gave
a
sharp
wistful
throb
i
glad
you
come
dorothy
said
lady
saxondale
approaching
from
the
shadowy
side
of
the
room
dorothy
turned
to
see
the
hands
of
her
ladyship
extended
as
if
calling
her
to
friendly
embrace
for
a
moment
she
looked
into
the
clear
kindly
eyes
of
the
older
woman
and
then
overcome
by
a
strange
inexplicable
longing
for
love
and
sympathy
dropped
her
hands
into
those
which
were
extended
i
come
to
beg
lady
saxondale
to
beg
you
to
be
kind
to
me
to
have
pity
for
my
mother
i
can
ask
no
more
she
said
simply
i
love
you
dear
we
all
love
you
be
content
for
a
little
while
a
little
while
and
then
you
will
thank
heaven
and
thank
i
demand
that
you
release
me
cried
the
other
you
are
committing
a
crime
against
all
justice
release
me
and
i
promise
to
forget
the
part
you
are
taking
in
this
outrage
trust
me
to
shield
you
and
yours
you
ask
me
to
trust
you
now
i
ask
you
to
trust
me
trust
me
to
shield
you
and
to
you
are
cruel

me
said
lady
saxondale
simply
she
pressed
the
hands
warmly
and
passed
from
the
room
dorothy
felt
her
head
reel
and
there
was
in
her
heart
the
dread
of
losing
something
precious
she
knew
not
what
come
up
into
the
tower
with
me
dorothy
said
lady
jane
coming
to
her
side
her
voice
soft
and
entreating
the
view
is
grand
savage
and
i
were
there
early
this
morning
to
see
the
sun
are
you
all
against
me
even
you
lady
jane
oh
how
have
i
wronged
you
that
i
should
be
made
to
suffer
so
at
your
hands
yes
yes
take
me
to
the
tower
i
ca
stay
i
shall
ask
savage
to
go
with
us
he
will
hold
you
it
would
be
too
bad
to
have
you
try
to
fly
from
up
there
because
it
a
long
way
to
the
crags
and
you
never
fly
again
in
this
world
at
least
i
believe
i
call
dickey
to
be
on
the
safe
there
was
something
so
merry
so
free
and
unrestrained
about
her
that
dorothy
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
with
a
new
sensation
in
her
heart
she
followed
her
guide
to
the
top
of
the
broad
stairway
here
her
ladyship
paused
placed
two
pink
fingers
between
her
teeth
and
sent
a
shrill
whistle
sounding
down
between
the
high
walls
all
right
came
a
happy
voice
from
below
there
was
a
scramble
of
feet
two
or
three
varied
exclamations
in
masculine
tones
and
then
savage
came
bounding
up
the
stairs
playing
chess
with
your
brother
and
had
to
break
up
the
game
when
duty
calls
you
know
morning
miss
garrison
what
up
we
just
on
the
point
of
going
up

jane
sweetly
up
in
the
tower

dorothy
under
the
spell
of
their
blithesome
spirits
lady
jane
the
young
lady
on
your
left
an
may

please
you
miss
said
dickey
bob

think
of
a
name
for
the
old
thing
so
he
commissioned
me
is
craneycrow
delightful
crane
that
a
bird
you
know
and
crow

another
bird
too
you
know
is
it
a
joy
i
so
proud
of
it
cried
lady
jane
as
she
scurried
up
the
narrow
winding
stone
steps
that
led
to
the
top
of
the
tower
dorothy
followed
more
sedately
the
smile
on
her
lips
the
excitement
of
a
new
emotion
surging
over
the
wall
of
anger
she
had
thrown
up
against
these
people
i
wish
i
could
go
out
and
explore
the
hills
and
rocks
about
this
place
said
dickey
wistfully
why
ca
you
is
it
dangerous
queried
dorothy
heavens
no
perfectly
safe
in
that
respect
oh
i
forgot
you
do
know
of
course
phil
quentin
and
your
devoted
servant

not
permitted
to
show
their
faces
outside

what

bold
bad
bandits
as
your
fellow
captives
alas
that
i
should
have
come
to
the
cruel
prison
cell
i
had
not
thought
of
that
said
miss
garrison
reflectively
and
then
she
looked
upon
dickey
with
a
new
interest
they
crawled
through
the
trap
door
and
out
upon
the
airy
crown
of
the
tower
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
awe
and
shrank
back
from
the
sky
that
seemed
to
press
down
upon
her
nothing
but
sky
blue
sky
then
she
peered
over
the
low
wall
down
upon
the
rocks
below
and
shuddered
hello
phil
great
is
it
exclaimed
dickey
and
dorothy
realized
that
quentin
was
somewhere
behind
her
in
the
little
circle
among
the
clouds
a
chill
fell
upon
her
heart
and
she
would
not
turn
toward
the
man
whose
very
name
brought
rage
to
her
heart
magnificent
i
have
been
up
here
in
the
sun
and
the
gale
for
half
an
hour
here
are
the
newspapers
lady
jane
bob
man
brought
them
an
hour
ago
there
is
something
in
them
that
will
interest

but
i
must
go
down
and
do
fall
off
the
tower
lady

good
little
girl
and
i
fall

tower

me
and
send

supper

a
wee
bit
longer
now

little
girl
i
must
go
see
you
later
dickey
called
after
him
as
he
disappeared
through
the
narrow
opening
dorothy
turned
her
stony
face
slightly
and
quick
angry
eyes
looked
for
an
instant
into
the
upturned
face
of
the
man
who
was
swallowed
in
the
darkness
of
the
trap
hole
almost
in
the
same
second
do
fall
off
the
tower
lady
jane
came
the
hollow
voice
from
the
ladders
far
below
and
to
dorothy
sensitive
ears
there
was
the
most
devilish
mockery
in
the
tones
i
can
forgive
all
of
you
all
of
you
but
but
never
that
inhuman
wretch
oh
how
i
hate
him
cried
she
her
face
ablaze
her
voice
trembling
with
passion
oh
dorothy
cried
lady
jane
softly
imploringly
i
wish
from
my
soul
that
this
tower
might
tumble
down
and
kill
him
this
instant
and
that
his
bones
could
never
be
found
wailed
the
other
there
an
awful
weight
above
him
miss
garrison
the
weight
of
your
wrath
said
dickey
without
a
smile
xxiv
the
white
flag
after
returning
to
her
room
later
on
dorothy
eagerly
devoured
the
contents
of
the
newspapers
which
were
a
day
or
two
old
they
devoted
columns
to
the
great
abduction
mystery
pictured
the
grief
of
the
mother
and
marvelled
at
her
courage
and
fortitude
traced
the
brigands
over
divers
streets
to
the
deserted
house
gave
interviews
with
the
bride
fiance
her
uncle
and
the
servants
who
were
found
in
the
stables
speculated
on
the
designs
of
the
robbers
their
whereabouts
and
the
nature
of
their
next
move
drew
vivid
and
terrifying
visions
of
the
lovely
bride
lying
in
some
wretched
cave
hovel
or
cellar
tortured
and
suffering
the
agony
of
the
damned
opinions
of
police
officers
disclosed
some
astonishing
solutions
to
the
mystery
but
withal
there
was
a
tone
of
utter
bewilderment
in
the
situation
as
they
pictured
it
she
read
the
long
and
valiant
declaration
of
prince
ugo
ravorelli
the
frantic
bridegroom
in
which
he
swore
to
rescue
the
fair
one
from
the
dastards
whoever
and
wherever
they
might
somehow
to
her
his
words
in
cold
print
looked
false
artificial
theatrical
anything
but
brave
and
convincing
she
stared
in
amazement
at
the
proclamation
offering
francs
for
her
restoration
the
general
opinion
however
was
that
the
abductors
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
submit
a
proposition
to
give
up
their
prize
for
not
less
than
twice
the
amount
to
a
man
the
police
maintained
that
miss
garrison
was
confined
somewhere
in
the
city
of
brussels
there
were
with
the
speculations
and
conjectures
no
end
of
biographical
sketches
and
portraits
she
found
herself
reading
with
a
sort
of
amused
interest
the
story
of
how
one
of
the
maids
had
buckled
her
satin
slippers
another
had
dressed
her
hair
another
had
done
something
and
another
something
else
it
was
all
very
entertaining
in
spite
of
the
conditions
that
made
the
stories
possible
but
what
amused
her
most
of
all
were
the
wild
guesses
as
to
her
present
whereabouts
there
was
a
direful
unanimity
of
opinion
that
she
was
groveling
in
her
priceless
on
the
floor
of
some
dark
filthy
cellar
the
papers
vividly
painted
her
as
haggard
faint
despairing
of
succor
beating
her
breast
and
tearing
her
beautiful
hair
in
the
confines
of
a
hole
in
the
ground
crying
for
help
in
tones
that
would
melt
a
heart
of
stone
and
guarded
by
devils
in
the
guise
of
men
then
she
came
to
the
paragraph
which
urged
the
utmost
punishment
that
law
could
inflict
upon
the
desperadoes
the
outraged
populace
could
be
appeased
with
nothing
save
death
in
its
most
ignominious
inglorious
form
the
trials
would
be
short
the
punishment
swift
and
sure
the
people
demanded
the
lives
of
the
villains
for
a
long
time
she
sat
with
expressionless
eyes
staring
at
the
wall
opposite
thinking
of
the
five
persons
who
kept
her
a
prisoner
thinking
of
the
lives
the
people
longed
to
take
thinking
of
death
death
to
pretty
lady
jane
to
lady
saxondale
to
lord
bob
to
dickey
savage
the
hunted
and
to
philip
quentin
the
arch
conspirator
to
kill
them
to
butcher
them
to
tear
them
to
pieces
that
was
what
it
meant
if
they
were
taken
before
the
maddened
people
when
baker
brought
in
the
tea
dorothy
was
shivering
as
one
with
a
chill
and
there
was
a
new
terror
in
her
soul
what
if
they
were
taken
could
she
endure
the
thought
that
death
was
sure
to
come
to
them
or
to
two
of
at
least
two
of
the
men
two
americans
during
the
next
three
days
she
refused
to
leave
her
room
coldly
declining
the
cordial
invitations
to
make
one
of
a
very
merry
house
party
as
lady
jane
called
it
her
meals
were
sent
to
her
room
and
baker
was
her
constant
attendant
into
her
cheek
came
the
dull
white
of
loneliness
and
despair
into
her
eye
the
fever
of
unrest
the
visits
met
with
disdain
and
gradually
they
became
less
frequent
on
the
third
day
of
this
separation
she
sat
alone
from
early
morn
until
dusk
without
the
first
sign
of
a
visit
from
either
lady
saxondale
or
lady
jane
all
day
long
she
had
been
expecting
them
and
now
she
was
beginning
to
hunger
for
them
a
ridiculous
inconsistent
irritation
had
been
building
itself
in
her
heart
since
midday
and
at
dusk
it
reached
its
limit
in
unmistakable
rage
that
they
might
be
willing
to
ignore
her
entirely
had
not
entered
her
mind
before
her
heart
was
very
bitter
toward
the
disagreeable
creatures
who
left
her
alone
all
day
in
a
stuffy
room
and
in
a
most
horrid
temper
to
boot
from
below
at
different
times
during
the
afternoon
came
the
happy
laughter
of
men
and
women
rollicking
songs
the
banging
of
a
piano
in
tantalizing
by
strong
new
york
fingers
the
soft
boom
of
a
chinese
dinner
gong
and
oh
it
was
maddening
to
sit
away
up
there
and
picture
the
heartless
joy
that
reigned
below
when
baker
left
the
room
dorothy
like
a
guilty
child
sneaked
actually
sneaked
to
the
hall
door
opened
it
softly
and
listened
with
wrathful
longing
to
the
signs
of
life
and
good
cheer
that
came
to
her
ears
desolate
dispirited
hungry
for
the
companionship
of
even
thieves
and
robbers
she
dragged
herself
to
the
broad
window
and
looked
darkly
down
upon
the
green
and
gray
world
her
pride
was
having
a
mighty
battle
for
three
long
days
had
she
maintained
a
stubborn
resistance
to
all
the
allurements
they
could
offer
she
had
been
strong
and
steadfast
to
her
purpose
until
this
hour
came
to
make
her
loneliness
almost
unendurable
the
hour
when
she
saw
they
were
mean
enough
to
pay
her
in
the
coin
of
her
own
making
now
she
was
crying
for
them
to
come
and
lift
the
pall
of
solitude
to
brighten
the
world
for
her
to
drive
the
deadly
sickness
out
of
her
heart
they
had
ignored
her
for
a
whole
day
because
she
was
reasonable
enough
to
see
they
felt
she
did
not
want
them
to
be
near
her
would
they
never
come
to
her
again
pride
was
commanding
her
to
scorn
them
forever
but
a
lonely
heart
was
begging
for
fellowship
baker
she
called
suddenly
turning
from
the
window
her
face
aglow
her
breath
coming
fast
her
heart
bounding
with
a
new
resolution
or
the
breaking
of
an
old
one
baker
did
not
respond
at
once
and
the
now
thoroughly
aroused
young
lady
hurried
impatiently
to
the
bedchamber
in
quest
of
her
the
maid
was
seated
in
a
window
with
ears
as
deaf
as
a
stone
reading
the
harrowing
news
from
the
latest
newspaper
that
had
come
to
castle
craneycrow
dorothy
had
read
every
line
of
the
newest
developments
and
had
laughed
scornfully
over
the
absurd
clews
the
police
were
following
she
had
been
seen
simultaneously
in
liverpool
and
in
london
and
in
paris
and
in
brussels
and
by
reputable
witnesses
too
baker
yes
miss
and
the
paper
rattled
to
the
floor
for
there
was
a
new
tone
in
the
voice
that
called
to
her
you
may
go
to
lady
saxondale
and
say
that
i
accept
invitation
to
dine
with
her
and
lord
yesterday
invitation
you
mean
miss
in
bewildered
tones
i
mean
yesterday
baker
you
forget
that
i
have
no
invitation
for
tell
her
that
miss
garrison
will
be
delighted
to
dine
with
baker
flew
out
of
the
room
and
downstairs
with
the
message
the
purport
of
which
did
not
sift
through
her
puzzled
head
until
lady
saxondale
smiled
and
instructed
her
to
inform
miss
garrison
that
she
would
be
charmed
to
have
her
dine
with
her
both
yesterday
and
in
the
meantime
dorothy
was
reproaching
herself
for
her
weakness
in
surrendering
she
would
meet
quentin
perhaps
be
placed
beside
him
while
she
could
not
or
would
not
speak
to
him
the
situation
was
sure
to
be
uncomfortable
and
they
would
think
she
was
giving
in
to
them
and
he
would
think
she
was
giving
in
to
him
and
but
anything
was
better
than
exile
while
standing
at
the
window
awaiting
baker
return
her
gaze
fell
upon
a
solitary
figure
trudging
along
the
white
road
far
down
among
the
foothills
the
figure
of
a
priest
in
his
long
black
robe
he
was
the
first
man
she
had
seen
on
the
road
and
she
watched
him
with
curious
speculative
eyes
a
holy
priest
she
was
thinking
the
friend
of
all
in
distress
why
not
me
would
he
could
he
help
me
oh
good
father
if
you
could
but
hear
me
if
i
could
but
reach
your
ears
how
far
away
he
is
what
a
little
speck
he
seems
away
down
there
why
i
believe
he
is
yes
he
is
looking
up
at
the
castle
can
he
see
me
but
pshaw
how
could
he
know
that
i
am
held
here
against
my
will
even
if
he
sees
my
handkerchief
how
can
he
know
that
i
want
him
to
help
me
she
was
waving
her
handkerchief
to
the
lonely
figure
in
the
road
to
her
amazement
he
paused
apparently
attracted
by
the
signal
for
a
brief
instant
he
gazed
upward
then
dropped
his
cowled
head
and
moved
slowly
away
she
watched
him
until
the
trees
of
the
valley
hid
his
form
from
view
and
she
was
alone
with
the
small
hope
that
he
might
again
some
day
pass
over
the
lonely
road
and
understand
when
the
dinner
gong
rang
she
was
ready
to
face
the
party
but
there
was
a
lively
thumping
in
her
breast
as
she
made
her
way
down
the
steps
at
the
bottom
she
was
met
by
lady
saxondale
and
a
moment
later
lord
bob
came
up
smiling
and
there
was
a
sudden
rush
of
warmth
to
her
heart
the
bubbling
over
of
some
queer
emotion
and
she
was
wringing
their
hands
with
a
gladness
she
could
not
conceal
i
am
so
lonely
up
there
lady
saxondale
she
said
simply
unreservedly
try
to
look
upon
us
as
friends
dorothy
trust
us
and
you
will
find
more
happiness
here
than
you
suspect
castle
craneycrow
was
born
and
went
to
ruin
in
the
midst
of
feud
and
strife
it
has
outlived
its
feudal
days
so
let
there
be
no
war
between
us
said
her
ladyship
earnestly
if
we
must
live
together
within
its
battered
walls
let
us
hoist
a
flag
of
truce
pick
up
the
gauntlet
and
tie
up
the
dogs
of
war
added
bluff
lord
bob
dorothy
smiled
and
said
there
is
one
here
who
is
not
and
can
never
be
included
in
our
truce
i
ask
you
to
protect
me
from
him
that
is
the
one
condition
i
you
have
no
enemies
here
my
but
i
have
a
much
too
zealous
last
call
for
dinner
in
the
shouted
dickey
savage
corning
down
the
stairs
hurriedly
i
was
afraid
i
be
late
glad
to
see
you
i
have
had
a
chance
to
ask
how
you
enjoyed
that
view
from
the
tower
the
other
she
had
given
him
her
hand
and
he
was
shaking
it
rapturously
it
was
glorious
and
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
if
you
have
explored
the
hills
and
i
afraid
of
snakes
and
other
creeping
things
he
said
slyly
they
had
gone
to
the
when
quentin
entered
he
was
paler
than
usual
but
he
was
as
calm
as
easy
and
as
as
if
he
had
never
known
a
conscience
in
all
his
life
she
was
not
looking
at
him
when
he
bowed
to
her
but
she
heard
his
clear
voice
say
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
sat
across
the
table
beside
lady
jane
who
was
opposite
dorothy
if
he
noticed
that
she
failed
to
return
his
greeting
he
was
not
troubled
to
his
credit
be
it
said
however
he
did
not
again
address
a
remark
to
her
during
the
meal
within
the
sound
of
his
voice
under
the
spell
of
his
presence
in
such
close
proximity
to
his
strong
body
she
could
not
but
give
a
part
of
her
thought
to
this
man
who
of
all
others
the
mob
would
slay
if
they
had
the
chance
she
could
not
conceal
from
herself
the
relief
she
felt
in
mingling
with
friends
a
willful
admiration
grew
full
in
the
face
of
resentful
opposition
and
there
was
a
reckless
downfall
of
dignity
they
treated
her
without
restraint
talked
as
freely
of
their
affairs
as
if
she
were
not
there
boldly
discussed
the
situation
in
brussels
and
laughed
over
the
frantic
efforts
of
the
authorities
helplessly
she
was
drawn
into
the
conversation
and
at
last
to
her
dismay
joined
with
them
in
condolences
to
the
police
but
some
day
they
will
find
the
right
trail
and
pounce
upon
you
like
so
many
wild
beasts
she
said
soberly
what
then
you
may
be
laughing
too
it
would
be
hard
luck
to
have
to
break
up
such
an
awfully
nice
house
party
said
dickey
solemnly
and
the
papers
say
they
will
kill
us
without
compunction
added
lady
jane
it
would
be
the
first
slaughter
this
old
house
has
known
said
lord
bob
in
the
old
days
they
used
to
kill
people
here
as
a
form
of
it
might
amuse
some
people
even
in
our
case
but
not
for
me
thanks
said
quentin
they
execute
me
first
however
and
i
would
have
to
endure
the
grief
of
seeing
the
rest
of
you
tossed
out
of
the
do
you
really
believe
they
would
kill
poor
little
me
demanded
lady
jane
slowly
her
eyes
fastened
on
her
brother
face
good
heaven
no
cried
dorothy
at
the
possibility
of
such
a
calamity
why
should
they
kill
a
helpless
girl
like
you
but
i
am
one
of
the
wretches
they
are
hunting
for
i
a
desperado
argued
lady
jane
i
insist
on
their
killing
lady
jane
just
the
same
as
the
rest
of
us
it
would
be
all
wrong
to
discriminate
even
if
she
is
young
and
and
well
far
from
ugly
declared
dickey
decidedly
you
might
try
to
save
my
life
savage
it
would
be
the
heroic
thing
to
do
she
said
well
i
agree
to
let
kill
me
twice
if
it
will
do
any
good
they
surely
be
obliging
if
i
said
it
was
to
please
a
lady
could
you
suggest
something
of
the
kind
to
them
miss
garrison
you
know
the
whole
massacre
is
in
your
honor
and
i
imagine
you
might
have
a
good
bit
to
say
about
the
minor
details
of
course
lady
jane
and
i
are
minor
details
purely
we
are
in
the
chorus
only
added
lady
jane
humbly
if
you
persist
in
this
talk
about
being
killed
i
go
upstairs
and
never
come
down
again
cried
dorothy
wretchedly
and
the
company
laughed
without
restraint
dickey
if
you
say
another
word
that
sounds
like
i
murder
you
myself
threatened
lord
bob
lady
jane
began
whetting
a
silver
table
knife
on
the
edge
of
her
plate
that
evening
dorothy
did
not
listen
to
dickey
savage
music
from
an
upstairs
room
she
stood
with
lady
jane
beside
the
piano
bench
and
fervently
applauded
joined
in
the
chorus
and
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
better
to
be
a
merry
prisoner
than
a
doleful
one
she
played
while
dickey
and
jane
danced
and
she
laughed
at
the
former
valiant
efforts
to
teach
the
english
girl
how
to
cake
philip
quentin
with
his
elbows
on
the
piano
moodily
watched
her
hands
occasionally
relaxing
into
a
smile
when
the
laughter
became
general
not
once
did
he
address
her
and
not
once
did
she
look
up
at
him
at
last
he
wandered
away
and
when
next
she
saw
him
he
was
sitting
in
a
far
corner
of
the
big
room
his
eyes
half
closed
his
head
resting
comfortably
against
the
high
back
of
the
chair
lord
and
lady
saxondale
hovered
about
the
friendly
piano
and
there
was
but
one
who
looked
the
outcast
conditions
had
changed
she
was
within
a
circle
of
pleasure
he
outside
she
gloated
in
the
fact
that
he
had
been
driven
into
temporary
exile
and
that
he
could
not
find
a
place
in
the
circle
as
long
as
she
was
there
occasionally
one
or
the
other
of
his
accomplices
glanced
anxiously
toward
the
quiet
outsider
but
no
one
asked
him
to
come
into
the
fold
in
the
end
his
indifference
began
to
irritate
her
when
lady
saxondale
rang
for
the
candles
near
the
midnight
hour
she
took
her
candlestick
from
the
maid
with
no
little
relief
and
unceremoniously
made
her
way
toward
the
hall
she
nervously
uttered
a
general
to
the
party
and
flushed
angrily
when
quentin
voice
responded
with
the
others
xxv
down
among
the
ghosts
i
can
not
endure
it
she
cried
to
herself
a
dozen
times
before
morning
i
shall
go
mad
if
i
have
to
see
his
face
and
hear
his
voice
and
feel
that
he
is
looking
at
me
there
must
be
a
way
to
escape
from
this
place
there
must
be
a
way
i
will
risk
anything
to
get
away
from
him
at
breakfast
she
did
not
see
him
he
had
eaten
earlier
with
lord
bob
the
others
noted
the
hunted
look
in
her
eye
and
saw
that
she
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
the
most
stupendous
of
efforts
to
enliven
the
dreary
table
failed
and
there
was
utter
collapse
to
the
rosy
hopes
they
had
begun
to
build
her
brain
was
filled
by
one
great
thought
escape
while
they
were
jesting
she
was
wondering
how
and
where
she
could
find
the
underground
passages
of
which
they
had
spoken
and
to
what
point
they
would
lead
i
give
a
round
sum
if
i
could
grow
a
set
of
whiskers
as
readily
and
as
liberally
as
turk
commented
dickey
sadly
he
came
out
of
phil
room
this
morning
and
i
dodged
behind
a
door
post
thinking
he
was
a
burglar
turk
looks
like
a
wild
man
from
borneo
and
his
whiskers
are
not
ten
days
out
he
letting
grow
so
that
he
can
venture
outside
the
castle
without
fear
of
recognition
i
like
to
get
outside
these
walls
for
half
a
i
detest
whiskers
decided
lady
jane
so
do
i
especially
turk
but
they
vastly
convenient
just
the
same
in
a
couple
of
days
turk
wo
know
himself
when
he
looks
in
the
mirror
i
believe
i
try
to
cultivate
a
i
sure
they
would
improve
you
very
much
said
lady
jane
aggressively
what
is
your
idea
as
to
color
well
i
rather
fancy
a
nice
amber
i
can
get
one
color
as
easily
as
another
have
you
a
preference
i
think
pink
or
blue
would
become
you
dickey
but
do
let
my
prejudices
influence
you
of
course
it
ca
make
any
difference
because
i
wo
recognize
you
you
in
other
words
if
i
do
cut
my
whiskers
you
cut
me
lots
of
nice
men
have
and
so
do
the
but
a
brigand
always
has
a
full
set
in
the
opera
at
you
are
only
a
brigand
apprentice
and
besides
this
is
an
opera
it
is
a
society
wo
you
have
another
egg
he
asked
looking
politely
at
her
plate
then
he
inquired
if
miss
garrison
would
like
to
join
him
in
a
climb
among
the
rocks
she
smiled
wistfully
and
said
she
would
be
charmed
to
do
so
if
she
were
not
too
feeble
with
age
when
the
time
came
to
start
consumed
with
a
desire
to
acquaint
herself
with
her
surroundings
she
begged
her
companions
to
take
her
over
the
castle
from
turret
to
cellar
later
in
the
day
with
turk
carrying
the
lantern
she
was
eagerly
taking
notes
in
the
vast
spooky
caves
of
craneycrow
vaulted
chambers
here
narrow
passages
there
ceilings
that
awoke
to
life
as
the
stooping
visitors
rustled
beneath
them
slimy
walls
and
ringing
floors
all
went
to
make
up
the
vast
grave
in
which
she
was
to
bury
all
hope
of
escape
immense
were
the
doors
that
led
from
one
room
to
another
huge
the
bolts
and
rusty
the
hinges
gruesome
and
icy
the
atmosphere
narrow
the
steps
that
led
to
regions
deeper
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
dorothy
heart
sank
like
lead
as
she
surveyed
the
impregnable
walls
and
listened
to
the
mighty
groans
of
doors
as
the
shoulder
of
the
sturdy
turk
awoke
them
to
torpid
activity
there
was
surprise
and
resentment
in
the
creak
of
grim
old
hinges
in
the
moans
of
rheumatic
timbers
in
the
jangle
of
lazy
chains
and
locks
the
stones
on
which
they
trod
seemed
to
snap
back
in
the
echo
of
their
footfalls
a
harsh
strident
laugh
of
derision
every
shadow
grinned
mockingly
at
her
the
very
darkness
ahead
of
the
way
seemed
to
snort
angrily
at
the
approach
of
the
intruders
the
whole
of
that
rockbound
dungeon
roared
defiance
in
answer
to
her
timid
prayer
and
snarled
an
ugly
challenge
to
her
courage
lady
saxondale
and
dickey
confronted
two
rather
girls
when
the
party
of
explorers
again
stood
in
the
sunlit
halls
above
across
their
shrinking
faces
cobwebs
were
lashed
plastered
with
the
dank
moisture
of
ages
in
their
eyes
gleamed
relief
and
from
their
lips
came
long
breaths
of
thankfulness
turk
out
of
sight
and
hearing
was
roundly
cursing
the
luck
that
had
given
him
such
a
disagreeable
task
as
the
one
just
ended
from
the
broad
warm
windows
in
the
south
once
the
great
banquet
hall
the
quartet
of
uncomfortable
looked
out
upon
the
open
courtyard
that
stretched
down
to
the
wall
and
for
the
moment
dorothy
envied
philip
quentin
he
was
briskly
pacing
the
inclosure
smoking
his
pipe
and
basking
in
the
sunshine
that
had
never
penetrated
to
the
horrors
of
castle
craneycrow
lord
bob
was
serenely
lounging
on
a
broad
oaken
bench
his
back
to
the
sun
reading
from
some
book
oh
wo
you
let
me
go
out
in
the
sun
for
just
a
little
while
she
cried
imploringly
a
mist
came
over
lady
saxondale
eyes
and
dickey
turned
away
abruptly
as
often
as
you
like
dorothy
the
courtyard
is
yours
as
much
as
it
is
ours
jane
will
you
take
her
through
our
fort
show
her
the
walls
the
parapets
the
bastions
and
where
the
moat
and
drawbridge
were
when
the
place
was
young
it
is
very
interesting
with
dickey
and
lady
jane
dorothy
passed
into
the
courtyard
and
into
the
open
air
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
week
she
felt
like
a
bird
with
clipped
wings
the
most
casual
inspection
convinced
her
that
there
was
no
possible
chance
of
escape
from
the
walled
quadrangle
in
the
center
of
which
loomed
the
immense
castle
the
wall
was
high
and
its
strength
was
as
unbroken
as
in
its
earliest
days
lord
saxondale
joined
them
and
explained
to
her
all
the
points
of
interest
about
the
castle
as
viewed
from
the
outside
but
quentin
quietly
abandoned
his
walk
and
disappeared
it
is
as
difficult
to
get
out
of
castle
as
it
is
to
get
in
i
dare
say
observed
dorothy
looking
with
awe
upon
the
grim
old
pile
of
rocks
they
called
a
castle
far
above
their
heads
stood
the
tower
from
which
she
had
seen
earth
and
sky
as
if
in
a
panorama
three
days
before
one
might
be
able
to
get
out
if
he
could
fly
it
seems
the
only
way
provided
of
course
there
were
opposition
to
his
departure
said
lord
bob
smiling
alas
i
can
not
fly
she
said
directly
at
the
rear
of
the
castle
where
the
stonework
had
been
battered
down
by
time
man
and
the
elements
she
saw
several
servants
at
work
you
have
trustworthy
servants
lord
saxondale
i
have
tried
to
bribe
one
of
you
see
miss
garrison
they
love
lady
frances
that
is
the
secret
of
their
loyalty
the
chances
are
they
sell
me
out
but
they
die
before
they
cut
loose
from
my
wife
by
jove
i
understand
how
it
is
that
everybody
is
won
over
by
you
american
during
the
trip
through
the
cellars
dorothy
had
learned
that
the
secret
passages
to
the
outside
world
began
in
the
big
chamber
under
the
tower
lady
saxondale
had
unwittingly
confessed
while
they
were
in
the
room
that
two
of
the
big
rocks
in
the
wall
were
false
and
that
they
were
in
reality
doors
which
opened
into
the
passages
one
of
the
passages
was
over
a
mile
long
and
there
were
hundreds
of
steps
to
descend
before
one
reached
a
level
where
walking
was
not
laborious
the
point
of
egress
was
through
a
hidden
cave
up
the
valley
near
the
ruins
of
an
old
church
where
the
other
passage
had
once
led
to
she
did
not
know
for
it
had
been
closed
by
the
caving
in
of
a
great
pile
of
rocks
with
a
determined
spirit
and
a
quaking
courage
dorothy
vowed
that
she
would
sooner
or
later
find
this
and
make
a
bold
dash
for
liberty
her
nerves
were
tingling
with
excitement
eagerness
and
a
horror
of
the
undertaking
and
she
could
scarcely
control
herself
until
the
opportunity
might
come
for
a
surreptitious
visit
to
the
underground
regions
her
first
thought
was
to
locate
if
possible
the
secret
door
leading
into
the
passage
with
that
knowledge
in
her
possession
she
could
begin
the
flight
at
once
or
await
a
favorable
hour
on
some
later
day
that
very
afternoon
brought
the
opportunity
for
which
she
was
waiting
the
other
women
retired
for
their
naps
and
the
men
went
to
the
billiard
room
the
lower
halls
were
deserted
and
she
had
little
difficulty
in
making
her
way
unseen
to
the
door
that
led
to
the
basement
here
she
paused
irresolutely
the
recollection
of
the
dismal
grasping
solitude
that
dwelt
beyond
the
portal
sending
again
the
chill
to
her
bones
she
remembered
that
turk
had
hung
the
lantern
on
a
peg
just
inside
the
door
and
she
had
provided
herself
with
matches
to
turn
the
key
open
the
door
pass
through
and
close
it
required
no
vast
amount
of
courage
for
it
would
be
but
an
instant
until
she
could
have
a
light
almost
before
she
knew
what
she
had
done
she
was
in
the
drafty
damp
stairway
and
the
heavy
door
was
between
her
and
her
unsuspecting
captors
with
trembling
agitated
fingers
she
struck
a
match
it
flickered
and
went
out
another
and
another
met
the
same
fate
and
she
began
to
despair
the
darkness
seemed
to
choke
her
a
sudden
panic
rushed
up
and
overwhelmed
her
fainting
courage
and
with
a
smothered
cry
of
terror
she
turned
to
throw
open
the
door
but
the
door
refused
to
open
a
modern
spring
lock
had
set
itself
against
her
return
to
the
coveted
security
of
the
halls
above
a
deathly
faintness
came
over
her
she
sobbed
as
she
threw
herself
against
the
stubborn
door
and
pounded
upon
its
panels
with
her
hands
something
dreadful
seemed
to
be
crawling
up
from
behind
out
of
the
cavernous
hole
that
was
always
night
the
paroxysms
of
fear
and
dread
finally
gave
way
to
despair
and
despair
is
ever
the
parent
of
pluck
impatiently
she
again
undertook
the
task
of
lighting
the
lantern
fearing
to
breathe
lest
she
destroy
the
wavering
treacherous
flame
that
burnt
inside
her
bleeding
hands
her
pretty
knuckles
were
bruised
and
cut
in
the
reckless
pounding
on
the
door
at
last
the
candle
inside
the
lantern
glass
began
to
flicker
feebly
and
then
came
the
certainty
that
perseverance
had
been
rewarded
light
filled
the
narrow
way
and
she
looked
timidly
down
the
rickety
stone
steps
dreading
to
venture
into
the
blackness
beyond
ahead
lay
the
possibility
of
escape
behind
lay
failure
and
the
certainty
that
no
other
opportunity
would
be
afforded
her
so
she
bravely
went
down
the
steps
her
knees
weakly
striking
against
each
other
the
lantern
jangling
noisily
against
the
stone
wall
how
she
managed
to
reach
the
chamber
under
the
tower
she
could
not
have
told
afterward
she
did
not
know
at
the
time
at
last
however
she
stood
with
blood
chilled
to
the
curdling
point
in
the
center
of
the
room
that
knew
the
way
to
the
outside
world
pounding
on
the
rocky
walls
with
a
piece
of
stone
against
which
her
foot
had
struck
she
at
length
found
a
block
that
gave
forth
the
hollow
sound
she
longed
to
hear
here
then
was
the
key
to
the
passage
and
it
only
remained
for
her
to
discover
the
means
by
which
the
osbtruction
could
be
moved
from
the
opening
for
half
an
hour
cold
with
fear
and
nervousness
she
sought
for
the
traditional
spring
but
her
efforts
were
in
vain
there
was
absolutely
no
solution
and
it
dawned
upon
her
that
she
was
doomed
to
return
to
the
upper
world
defeated
indeed
unless
she
could
make
those
in
the
castle
hear
her
cries
it
was
possible
that
she
might
actually
die
of
starvation
in
the
pitiless
cavern
the
lantern
dropped
from
her
palsied
fingers
and
she
half
sank
against
the
stubborn
door
in
the
wall
to
be
back
once
more
in
the
rooms
above
with
cheery
human
beings
instead
of
with
the
spirits
of
she
knew
not
how
many
murdered
men
and
women
was
now
her
only
desire
her
only
petition
the
contact
of
her
body
with
the
slab
in
some
way
brought
about
the
result
for
which
she
had
striven
the
door
moved
slowly
downward
and
a
dash
of
freezing
air
came
from
the
widening
aperture
at
the
top
blowing
damp
across
her
face
staggering
away
from
the
ghostlike
hole
that
seemed
to
grin
fiendishly
until
it
spread
itself
into
a
long
black
gulf
with
eyes
a
voice
and
clammy
hands
she
grabbed
up
the
still
lighted
lantern
and
cried
aloud
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
the
door
slowly
sank
out
of
sight
and
the
way
was
open
but
her
courage
was
gone
what
was
beyond
that
black
hole
could
she
live
in
the
foul
air
that
poured
forth
from
that
dismal
mouth
trembling
like
a
leaf
she
lifted
the
lantern
and
peered
into
the
aperture
standing
quite
close
to
the
edge
her
eyes
fastened
themselves
in
mute
horror
upon
the
object
that
first
met
their
gaze
she
could
not
breathe
her
heart
ceased
beating
and
every
vestige
of
life
seemed
to
pass
beyond
recall
she
was
looking
upon
the
skeleton
of
a
human
being
crouched
hunched
against
the
wall
of
the
narrow
passage
a
headless
skeleton
for
the
skull
rolled
out
against
her
feet
as
the
sliding
door
sank
below
the
level
slowly
she
backed
away
from
the
door
not
knowing
what
she
did
conscious
only
that
her
eyes
could
not
be
drawn
from
the
horrifying
spectacle
oh
god
she
moaned
in
direst
terror
her
ghastly
companion
seemed
to
edge
himself
toward
her
an
illusion
born
in
the
changing
position
of
the
light
as
she
retreated
dorothy
came
a
voice
behind
her
and
she
screamed
aloud
in
terror
dropping
the
lantern
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
as
she
swayed
limply
a
pair
of
arms
closed
about
her
and
a
voice
she
knew
so
well
called
her
name
again
and
again
she
did
not
swoon
but
it
was
an
interminably
long
time
to
him
before
she
exhibited
the
faintest
sign
of
life
other
than
the
convulsive
shudders
that
swept
through
her
body
at
last
her
hands
clasped
his
arm
fiercely
and
her
body
stiffened
is
it
you
phil
oh
is
it
really
you
take
me
away
from
this
place
anywhere
anywhere
i
do
anything
you
say
but
do
let
that
awful
thing
come
near
me
she
wailed
by
the
flickering
light
he
caught
the
terrified
expression
in
her
eyes
you
are
safe
dear
i
carry
you
upstairs
if
you
like
he
said
softly
i
can
walk
or
run
oh
why
did
i
come
here
but
phil
suddenly
we
are
locked
in
this
place
we
ca
get
out
oh
yes
we
can
he
cried
quickly
come
with
he
picked
up
the
lantern
threw
an
arm
about
her
and
hurried
toward
the
stairs
that
led
aloft
afterwards
he
was
not
ashamed
to
admit
that
he
imagined
he
felt
bony
hands
clutching
at
him
from
behind
and
fear
lent
speed
to
his
legs
up
the
stairs
they
crowded
and
he
clutched
at
the
huge
handle
on
the
door
in
surprise
he
threw
his
weight
against
the
timbers
and
a
moment
later
dropped
back
with
an
exclamation
of
dismay
the
door
was
locked
what
does
it
mean
he
gasped
i
left
it
standing
open
when
i
came
down
the
draft
must
have
shut
it
do
be
alarmed
dorothy
kick
the
damned
thing
down
what
an
idiot
i
was
to
tell
no
one
that
i
was
coming
down
but
his
kicking
did
not
budge
the
door
and
the
noise
did
not
bring
relief
she
held
the
lantern
while
he
fought
with
the
barricade
and
she
was
strangely
calm
and
brave
the
queer
turn
of
affairs
was
gradually
making
itself
felt
and
her
brain
was
clearing
quickly
she
was
not
afraid
now
that
he
was
there
but
a
new
sensation
was
rushing
into
her
heart
it
was
the
sensation
of
shame
and
humiliation
that
he
of
all
men
should
find
her
in
that
unhappy
inglorious
plight
ending
her
bold
dash
for
freedom
with
the
most
womanly
of
failures
was
far
from
comforting
to
say
the
least
dorothy
i
ca
move
it
i
kicked
my
toes
off
and
my
knees
are
bleeding
but
there
it
stands
like
a
rock
we
got
to
stay
here
till
some
one
chances
to
hear
us
he
said
ruefully
are
you
afraid
now
why
did
you
spring
the
lock
when
you
came
down
this
is
a
pretty
pass
i
must
say
she
said
her
voice
still
shaky
her
logic
abnormal
i
like
that
were
you
any
better
off
before
i
came
than
you
are
now
how
were
you
going
to
get
out
may
i
ask
he
demanded
coolly
seating
himself
on
the
top
step
she
stood
leaning
against
the
wooden
door
the
diplomatic
lantern
between
them
i
was
going
out
by
another
way
she
said
shortly
but
a
shudder
gave
the
lie
to
the
declaration
do
you
know
where
that
hidden
passage
leads
to
he
asked
looking
up
into
her
face
she
was
brushing
cobwebs
from
her
dress
to
a
cave
near
the
old
church
she
replied
triumphantly
blissful
ignorance
he
laughed
it
does
lead
anywhere
as
it
now
exists
you
see
there
was
a
a
few
decades
ago
is
that
the
one
that
caved
in
she
cried
in
dismay
so
saxondale
tells
and
and
how
did
the
the
how
did
that
awful
thing
get
in
there
she
asked
a
new
awe
coming
over
her
well
that
hard
to
tell
bob
says
the
door
has
never
been
opened
to
his
knowledge
nobody
knows
the
secret
combination
or
whatever
you
call
it
the
chances
are
that
the
poor
fellow
whose
bones
we
saw
got
locked
in
there
and
could
get
out
so
he
died
that
what
might
have
happened
to
you
you
oh
you
brute
how
can
you
suggest
such
a
thing
she
cried
and
she
longed
to
sit
close
beside
him
even
though
he
was
her
most
detested
enemy
oh
i
would
have
saved
you
from
that
fate
never
but
you
could
not
have
known
that
i
was
inside
the
do
you
suppose
i
came
down
here
on
a
pleasure
trip
you
you
do
mean
that
you
knew
i
was
here
certainly
it
is
why
i
came
to
this
blessed
spot
it
is
my
duty
to
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
you
i
prefer
to
be
called
miss
garrison
coldly
if
you
had
been
merely
miss
garrison
to
me
you
be
off
on
a
bridal
tour
with
ravorelli
at
this
moment
instead
of
enjoying
a
rather
unusual
with
me
seriously
dorothy
you
will
be
wise
if
you
submit
to
the
inevitable
until
fate
brings
a
change
of
its
own
accord
you
are
brave
and
determined
i
know
and
i
love
you
more
than
ever
for
this
daring
attempt
to
get
out
of
craneycrow
but
you
do
know
what
it
might
have
brought
you
to
good
heavens
no
one
knows
what
dangers
lie
in
those
awful
passages
they
have
not
been
used
in
a
hundred
years
think
of
what
you
were
risking
do
for
your
own
sake
try
anything
so
uncertain
again
i
knew
you
were
down
here
but
no
one
else
knows
how
you
opened
that
secret
door
i
do
not
know
but
we
both
know
what
happened
to
one
other
poor
wretch
who
solved
the
i
did
solve
it
really
i
did
i
do
know
how
it
happened
it
just
opened
that
all
and
then
i
oh
it
was
terrible
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
and
he
leaped
to
his
feet
do
think
about
it
dorothy
it
was
enough
to
frighten
you
to
death
gad
i
should
have
gone
mad
had
i
been
in
your
he
put
his
arm
about
her
shoulder
and
for
a
moment
she
offered
no
resistance
then
she
remembered
who
and
what
he
was
and
imperiously
lifted
angry
eyes
to
his
the
skeleton
may
have
been
a
gentleman
in
his
day
quentin
even
now
as
i
think
of
him
in
horror
he
could
not
be
as
detestable
as
you
open
this
door
sir
she
said
her
voice
quivering
with
indignation
i
wish
i
could
dorothy
you
do
believe
that
i
have
the
power
to
open
this
door
and
am
blackguard
enough
to
keep
you
here
my
god
what
do
you
think
i
am
he
cried
drawing
away
from
her
open
this
door
she
commanded
resolutely
he
looked
long
and
earnestly
into
her
unflinching
eyes
and
his
heart
chilled
as
if
ice
had
clogged
the
blood
i
can
not
open
it
he
said
at
last
with
not
another
word
he
sat
down
again
at
her
feet
and
for
what
seemed
like
an
age
neither
spoke
the
lantern
sputtered
warningly
but
they
did
not
know
the
light
of
its
life
was
ebbing
away
they
breathed
and
thought
and
that
was
all
at
length
the
chill
air
began
to
tell
and
he
plainly
heard
the
chatter
of
her
teeth
the
rustling
of
her
dress
as
her
body
shivered
he
arose
stiff
and
cold
drew
off
his
coat
and
threw
it
about
her
shoulders
she
resisted
at
first
but
he
was
master
later
his
waistcoat
was
wrapped
about
her
throat
and
the
warm
lantern
was
placed
at
her
feet
but
she
never
gave
him
one
look
of
gratitude
at
intervals
he
pounded
on
the
door
until
finally
there
came
the
joyous
rasping
sound
of
a
key
in
the
lock
and
then
excited
exclamations
filled
the
ears
of
the
two
prisoners
xxvi
the
king
of
turk
has
been
in
brussels
said
quentin
to
her
on
the
day
following
her
underground
adventure
she
was
walking
in
the
courtyard
and
her
brain
was
busy
with
a
new
interest
again
had
the
lonely
priest
passed
along
the
road
far
below
and
she
had
made
him
understand
that
he
was
wanted
at
the
castle
gates
when
he
turned
off
the
road
and
began
slowly
to
climb
the
steep
she
was
almost
suffocated
with
nervous
excitement
her
experience
of
the
day
before
had
left
her
unstrung
and
on
the
verge
of
collapse
and
she
was
beginning
to
enjoy
a
strange
resignation
she
was
beginning
to
feel
that
there
were
terrors
worse
than
those
of
the
kindly
prison
and
that
escape
might
be
tenfold
more
unpleasant
than
confinement
then
she
saw
the
priest
and
her
attempt
to
attract
his
attention
to
her
plight
resulted
so
differently
from
what
she
had
expected
that
her
nerves
were
again
leaping
with
the
old
desire
to
outwit
her
captors
he
was
coming
to
the
castle
but
how
was
she
to
acquaint
him
with
the
true
state
of
affairs
she
would
not
be
permitted
to
see
him
much
less
to
talk
with
him
of
that
she
was
sure
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
she
went
into
the
courtyard
and
loitered
near
the
big
gates
trying
to
appear
at
ease
she
prayed
for
but
a
few
moments
time
in
which
to
cry
out
to
him
that
she
was
a
prisoner
and
the
woman
for
whom
francs
were
offered
in
brussels
but
now
comes
quentin
upon
the
scene
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
taken
a
heavy
cold
in
the
damp
cellar
she
deliberately
turned
her
back
upon
him
not
so
much
in
disdain
as
to
hide
the
telltale
confusion
in
her
face
all
hope
of
conversing
with
the
priest
was
lost
if
quentin
remained
near
by
i
sent
him
to
brussels
dorothy
and
he
has
learned
something
that
will
be
of
vital
interest
to
you
philip
went
on
idly
leaning
against
the
gate
as
if
fate
itself
had
sent
him
there
to
frustrate
her
designs
do
talk
to
me
now
philip
you
must
give
me
time
in
an
hour
when
i
have
gotten
over
this
dreadful
headache
i
will
listen
to
you
but
now
for
heaven
sake
leave
me
to
myself
she
said
rapidly
resorting
to
deception
i
sorry
i
have
disturbed
you
in
an
hour
then
or
at
any
time
you
may
feel
like
listening
it
concerns
prince
is
he
what
has
happened
to
him
she
demanded
turning
to
him
with
alarm
in
her
eyes
it
is
not
what
has
happened
to
him
but
to
one
who
was
his
intimate
the
woman
who
warned
me
to
beware
of
his
treachery
has
been
murdered
in
brussels
shall
i
come
to
you
here
in
an
hour
yes
she
said
slowly
the
consciousness
of
a
new
dread
showing
itself
in
her
voice
it
was
not
until
he
reentered
the
house
that
she
became
fully
possessed
of
a
desire
to
learn
more
of
this
startling
news
her
mind
went
back
to
the
strange
young
woman
who
came
to
her
with
the
story
of
the
prince
duplicity
and
her
blood
grew
cold
with
the
thought
that
brutal
death
had
come
to
her
so
soon
after
that
visit
she
recalled
the
woman
voice
her
unquestioned
refinement
her
dignity
of
bearing
and
the
positiveness
with
which
she
declared
that
ugo
would
kill
her
if
he
knew
the
nature
of
her
visit
to
his
promised
wife
and
now
she
was
dead
murdered
by
whom
that
question
burst
upon
her
with
the
force
of
a
heavy
blow
who
killed
her
a
pounding
on
the
heavy
gate
brought
her
sharply
to
the
project
of
the
moment
she
walked
as
calmly
as
her
nerves
would
admit
to
the
gate
and
called
in
french
who
is
there
father
paul
came
a
subdued
voice
from
the
outside
am
i
wrong
in
believing
that
i
was
called
here
by
some
one
in
the
castle
kindly
admit
me
i
am
fatigued
and
i
can
not
open
the
gate
good
father
you
must
aid
me
to
escape
from
this
place
she
cried
eagerly
her
breast
thumping
like
a
hammer
there
was
no
interruption
and
she
could
have
shrieked
with
triumph
when
five
minutes
later
the
priest
bade
her
be
of
good
cheer
and
to
have
confidence
in
him
he
would
come
for
her
on
the
next
night
but
one
and
she
should
be
freed
from
her
window
in
the
castle
she
saw
the
holy
man
descend
the
steep
with
celerity
not
born
of
fatigue
when
he
reached
the
road
below
he
turned
and
waved
his
hand
to
her
and
then
made
his
way
swiftly
into
the
forest
after
it
was
all
over
and
relief
was
promised
her
excitement
subsided
and
in
its
place
began
to
grow
a
dull
contemplation
of
what
her
rescue
would
mean
to
the
people
who
were
holding
her
captive
it
meant
exposure
arrest
imprisonment
and
perhaps
death
the
appeal
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
ears
of
the
passing
priest
would
soon
be
public
property
and
another
day
might
see
the
jubilant
minions
of
the
law
in
front
of
castle
craneycrow
demanding
her
release
and
the
surrender
of
the
culprits
there
was
not
the
joy
in
her
heart
that
she
had
expected
instead
there
was
a
sickening
fancy
that
she
had
done
something
mean
and
treacherous
when
she
rejoined
the
unsuspecting
party
downstairs
soon
afterward
a
mighty
weakness
assailed
her
and
it
was
she
instead
of
they
who
had
boldly
stolen
her
from
her
home
that
felt
the
pangs
of
guilt
she
went
into
the
courtyard
where
savage
and
lady
jane
were
playing
handball
while
the
saxondales
looked
on
happily
unconscious
of
a
traitor
in
their
midst
for
an
instant
pale
and
remorseful
she
leaned
against
the
struggling
to
suppress
the
tears
of
pity
and
contrition
before
she
had
fully
recovered
her
strength
lady
jane
was
drawing
her
into
the
contest
with
dickey
and
so
she
played
cravenly
with
those
whose
merry
hearts
she
was
to
crush
listening
to
the
plaudits
of
the
two
smiling
onlookers
it
was
too
late
to
save
them
for
a
priest
of
god
had
gone
out
into
the
world
to
herald
their
guilt
and
to
deal
a
blow
that
would
shatter
everything
quentin
came
down
a
little
later
and
she
was
conscious
that
he
watched
the
game
with
eyes
in
which
pleasure
and
trouble
fought
for
supremacy
tired
at
last
of
the
violent
exercise
the
trio
threw
themselves
upon
the
bench
in
the
shade
of
the
wall
and
with
glowing
faces
and
thumping
breasts
two
of
them
laughed
over
the
antics
they
had
cut
dorothy
lawless
lover
stood
afar
off
lonely
and
with
the
resignation
of
the
despised
presently
he
drew
near
and
asked
if
he
might
join
them
in
the
shade
what
a
dreadful
cold
you
have
taken
phil
cried
lady
saxondale
anxiously
commonest
sort
of
a
cold
i
assure
you
damp
cellars
do
agree
with
me
he
said
i
did
not
want
your
coat
but
you
would
give
it
to
me
said
dorothy
as
if
called
upon
to
defend
herself
for
some
crime
it
was
you
or
i
for
the
cold
you
know
he
said
simply
and
i
was
your
right
and
good
agreed
dickey
could
do
anything
else
lady
needed
a
coat
had
to
have
it
and
she
got
it
duty
called
and
found
him
prepared
that
why
he
always
wears
a
coat
in
the
presence
of
i
had
your
friend
the
skeleton
buried
said
lord
bob
poor
chap
he
seemed
all
broken
up
over
leaving
the
yes
went
all
to
pieces
added
dickey
dickey
savage
do
you
think
you
are
funny
demanded
lady
jane
loftily
i
would
not
jest
about
the
the
last
i
saw
of
him
he
was
grinning
like
the
oh
you
wretch
cried
the
girl
and
dorothy
put
her
fingers
to
her
ears
shut
up
dickey
exclaimed
quentin
do
you
care
to
hear
about
that
woman
in
brussels
dorothy
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
to
me
but
i
listen
if
you
like
she
said
slowly
thereupon
he
related
to
the
party
the
story
of
the
finding
of
the
dead
woman
in
a
house
near
the
garrison
home
in
the
avenue
louise
she
had
been
dead
for
two
days
and
her
throat
was
cut
the
house
in
which
she
was
found
was
the
one
into
which
turk
had
seen
courant
disappear
on
the
night
of
the
veranda
incident
at
the
garrison
turk
had
been
sent
to
brussels
by
quentin
on
a
mission
of
considerable
importance
arriving
there
soon
after
the
body
was
discovered
he
saw
the
woman
face
at
the
morgue
and
recognized
her
as
the
one
who
had
approached
quentin
in
the
train
for
paris
turk
learned
that
the
police
to
all
appearances
had
found
a
clew
but
had
suddenly
dropped
the
whole
matter
and
the
woman
was
classified
with
the
unknown
an
attendant
at
the
morgue
carelessly
remarked
in
his
hearing
that
she
was
the
mistress
of
a
great
man
who
had
sent
them
word
to
throw
her
in
the
secretly
turk
assured
himself
that
there
was
no
mistake
as
to
the
house
in
which
she
had
been
found
and
by
putting
two
and
two
together
it
was
not
unnatural
to
agree
with
the
morgue
officer
and
to
supply
for
his
own
benefit
the
name
of
the
royal
lover
the
newspapers
which
turk
brought
from
brussels
to
castle
craneycrow
contained
accounts
of
the
murder
of
the
beautiful
woman
speculated
wildly
as
to
her
idenity
and
termed
the
transaction
a
mystery
as
unsolvable
as
the
great
abduction
the
same
papers
had
the
report
on
good
authority
that
miss
garrison
had
been
murdered
by
her
captors
in
a
small
town
in
spain
the
authorities
being
so
hot
on
the
trail
that
she
was
put
out
of
the
way
for
safety
sake
but
the
papers
did
not
know
that
a
bearded
man
named
turk
had
slipped
a
sealed
envelope
under
a
door
at
the
garrison
home
and
that
a
distressed
mother
had
assurance
from
the
brigand
chief
that
her
daughter
was
alive
and
well
but
where
she
could
not
be
found
to
prove
that
the
letter
was
no
imposition
it
was
accompanied
by
a
lock
of
hair
from
dorothy
head
two
or
three
bits
of
jewelry
and
a
lace
handkerchief
that
could
not
have
belonged
to
another
dorothy
did
not
know
how
or
when
baker
secured
these
bits
of
evidence
when
quentin
told
her
the
chief
object
of
turk
perilous
visit
to
brussels
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
grateful
to
him
i
have
a
confession
to
make
she
said
after
the
story
was
finished
and
the
others
had
deliberately
charged
ugo
with
the
crime
that
poor
woman
came
to
me
in
brussels
and
implored
me
to
give
up
the
prince
she
told
me
phil
that
she
loved
him
and
warned
me
to
beware
of
him
and
she
said
that
he
would
kill
her
if
he
knew
that
she
had
come
to
that
settles
it
exclaimed
he
excitedly
the
fever
of
joy
in
his
eyes
he
killed
her
when
he
found
that
she
had
been
to
you
perhaps
goaded
to
desperation
she
confessed
to
him
imagine
the
devilish
delight
he
took
in
sniffing
out
her
life
after
that
we
have
him
now
dorothy
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
he
and
he
alone
had
an
object
in
killing
her
you
have
only
to
tell
the
story
of
her
visit
to
you
and
we
hang
the
miserable
he
was
standing
before
her
and
intense
you
forget
that
i
am
not
and
do
not
for
some
time
expect
to
be
in
a
position
to
expose
him
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
law
will
first
require
me
to
testify
against
you
philip
quentin
she
said
looking
fairly
into
his
eyes
the
old
resentment
returning
like
a
flash
afterward
she
knew
that
the
look
of
pain
in
his
face
touched
her
heart
but
she
did
not
know
it
then
she
saw
the
beaten
joy
go
out
of
his
eyes
and
she
rejoiced
in
the
victory
true
he
said
softly
i
have
saved
the
woman
i
love
while
he
has
merely
killed
one
who
loved
it
angered
her
unreasonably
when
as
he
turned
to
enter
the
house
lady
saxondale
put
her
arm
through
his
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
a
moment
or
two
later
lady
jane
as
if
unable
to
master
the
emotion
which
impelled
hurried
into
the
castle
after
them
dickey
strolled
away
and
she
was
left
with
lord
bob
it
would
have
been
a
relief
had
he
expressed
the
slightest
sign
of
surprise
or
regret
but
he
was
as
imperturbable
as
the
wall
against
which
he
leaned
his
mild
blue
eyes
gazed
carelessly
at
the
coils
of
smoke
that
blew
from
his
lips
oh
she
wailed
to
herself
in
the
impotence
of
anger
they
all
love
him
they
all
hate
me
why
does
he
not
mistreat
me
insult
me
taunt
me
anything
that
will
cost
him
their
respect
their
devotion
how
bitterly
they
feel
toward
me
for
that
remark
it
will
kill
me
to
stay
here
and
see
them
turn
to
him
as
if
he
were
some
god
and
i
the
defiler
that
night
there
was
a
battle
between
the
desire
to
escape
and
the
reluctance
she
felt
in
exposing
her
captors
to
danger
in
the
end
she
admitted
to
herself
that
she
would
not
have
philip
quentin
seized
by
the
officers
she
would
give
them
all
an
equal
chance
to
escape
he
with
the
others
her
heart
softened
when
she
saw
him
in
her
imagination
alone
and
beaten
in
the
hands
of
the
police
led
away
to
ignominy
and
death
the
others
perhaps
safe
through
his
loyalty
she
would
refuse
absolutely
irrevocably
to
divulge
the
names
of
her
captors
and
would
go
so
far
as
to
perjure
herself
to
save
them
if
need
be
with
that
charitable
resolution
in
her
heart
she
went
to
sleep
when
she
arose
the
next
morning
baker
told
her
that
quentin
was
his
cold
had
settled
on
his
lungs
and
he
had
a
fever
lady
saxondale
seemed
worried
over
the
rather
lugubrious
report
from
dickey
savage
who
came
downstairs
early
with
phil
apologies
for
not
presenting
himself
at
the
breakfast
table
while
quentin
cheerfully
declared
that
he
would
be
himself
before
night
dickey
was
in
a
doleful
state
of
mind
and
ventured
the
opinion
that
he
was
in
for
a
rough
spell
of
what
distresed
the
saxondales
most
was
the
dismal
certainty
that
a
doctor
could
not
be
called
to
the
castle
if
quentin
were
to
become
seriously
ill
the
situation
would
develop
into
something
extremely
embarrassing
he
insisted
on
coming
downstairs
about
noon
and
laughed
at
the
remonstrances
of
lord
bob
and
dickey
who
urged
him
to
remain
in
bed
for
a
day
or
two
at
least
his
cough
was
a
cruel
one
and
his
eyes
were
bright
with
the
fever
that
raced
through
his
system
the
medicine
chest
offered
its
quinine
and
its
plasters
for
his
benefit
and
there
was
in
the
air
the
tense
anxiety
that
is
felt
when
a
child
is
ill
and
the
outcome
is
in
doubt
the
friends
of
this
strong
stubborn
and
sick
man
could
not
conceal
the
fact
that
they
were
nervous
and
that
they
dreaded
the
probability
of
disaster
in
the
shape
of
serious
illness
his
croaking
laugh
his
tearing
cough
and
that
flushed
face
caused
dorothy
more
pain
than
she
was
willing
to
admit
even
to
herself
as
night
drew
near
she
quivered
with
excitement
was
she
to
leave
the
castle
would
the
priest
come
for
her
above
all
would
he
be
accompanied
by
a
force
of
officers
large
enough
to
storm
the
castle
and
overpower
its
inmates
what
would
the
night
bring
forth
and
what
would
be
the
stand
the
course
taken
by
this
defiant
sick
man
this
man
with
two
fevers
in
his
blood
she
had
not
seen
or
spoken
to
him
during
the
day
but
she
had
frequently
passed
by
the
door
of
the
library
in
which
he
sat
and
talked
with
the
other
men
an
irresistible
longing
to
speak
to
him
to
tell
him
how
much
she
regretted
his
illness
came
over
her
there
was
in
her
heart
a
strange
tenderness
a
hungry
desire
to
comfort
him
just
the
least
bit
before
she
took
the
flight
that
was
to
destroy
the
hope
his
daring
and
skillfully
executed
scheme
had
inspired
three
times
she
hesitated
in
front
of
the
library
door
but
her
courage
was
not
as
strong
as
her
desire
were
he
alone
she
could
have
gone
in
and
told
him
frankly
that
she
would
not
expose
him
to
the
law
in
the
event
that
she
ever
had
the
opportunity
but
the
other
men
were
with
him
besides
his
cough
was
so
distressing
that
natural
pity
for
one
suffering
physical
pain
would
have
made
it
impossible
to
talk
to
him
with
the
essential
show
of
indifference
at
last
in
despair
she
left
lady
saxondale
and
her
companion
in
the
courtyard
and
started
up
the
stairs
resolved
to
be
as
far
as
possible
from
the
sound
of
that
cough
quentin
met
her
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
i
going
to
lie
down
awhile
he
said
wearily
they
seem
to
be
worried
about
this
confounded
cold
and
i
satisfy
them
by
packing
myself
away
in
you
should
be
very
careful
phil
she
said
a
suffocating
feeling
in
her
throat
your
cough
is
frightful
and
they
say
you
have
a
fever
do
be
dorothy
he
said
pausing
before
her
at
the
steps
his
voice
full
of
entreaty
tell
me
you
do
despise
me
oh
i
long
to
have
you
say
one
tender
word
to
me
to
have
one
gentle
look
from
your
i
am
very
sorry
you
are
suffering
philip
she
said
steeling
her
heart
against
the
weakness
that
threatened
wo
you
believe
i
have
done
all
this
because
i
love
you
and
he
was
saying
passionately
but
she
interposed
do
do
phil
i
was
forgetting
a
little
yes
i
was
forgetting
a
little
but
you
bring
back
all
the
ugly
thoughts
i
can
not
forget
and
i
will
not
forgive
you
love
me
i
know
and
you
have
been
a
kind
jailer
but
you
must
not
expect
to
regain
my
respect
and
love
yes
it
was
love
up
to
the
morning
i
saw
you
in
the
of
this
i
create
a
new
love
in
your
heart
dorothy
he
cried
the
old
love
may
be
dead
but
a
new
one
shall
grow
up
in
its
place
you
do
not
feel
toward
me
as
you
did
a
week
ago
i
have
made
some
headway
against
the
force
of
your
hatred
it
will
take
time
to
win
completely
i
would
not
have
you
succumb
too
soon
but
just
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
you
will
love
me
some
day
for
the
love
that
made
me
a
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
i
love
you
dorothy
i
love
you
it
is
too
late
you
have
destroyed
the
power
to
love
phil
i
can
not
forgive
you
could
i
love
you
unless
full
forgiveness
paved
the
way
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
as
you
will
some
day
confess
you
will
thank
and
forgive
me
for
what
i
have
a
fit
of
coughing
caused
him
to
lean
against
the
stair
rail
a
paroxysm
of
pain
crossing
his
face
as
he
sought
to
temper
the
violence
of
the
spell
you
should
have
a
doctor
she
cried
in
alarm
he
smiled
cheerlessly
send
for
the
court
physician
he
said
derisively
the
king
of
has
the
chills
and
fever
they
say
is
my
face
hot
dorothy
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
impulsively
placed
her
cool
hand
against
his
flushed
forehead
despite
her
will
there
was
a
caress
in
the
simple
act
and
his
bright
eyes
gleamed
with
gladness
his
hand
met
hers
as
it
was
lowered
from
the
hot
brow
and
his
lips
touched
the
fingers
softly
ah
the
fever
the
fever
he
exclaimed
passionately
you
should
have
a
doctor
she
muttered
as
if
powerless
to
frame
other
words
xxvii
the
flight
with
the
priest
eleven
that
night
found
castle
craneycrow
wrapped
in
the
stillness
of
death
its
inmates
were
awake
but
they
were
petrified
paralyzed
by
the
discovery
that
dorothy
garrison
was
gone
scared
eyes
looked
upon
white
faces
and
there
was
upon
the
heart
of
each
the
clutch
of
an
icy
hand
so
appalling
was
the
sensation
that
the
five
conspirators
breathed
not
nor
spoke
but
listened
for
the
heartbeats
that
had
stopped
when
fears
finally
gave
way
to
complete
conviction
they
were
as
if
recovering
from
the
fright
of
seeing
a
ghost
spirits
seemed
to
have
swept
past
them
with
cold
wings
carrying
off
the
prisoner
they
thought
secure
only
supernatural
forces
could
be
charged
with
the
penetration
of
their
impregnable
wall
the
discovery
of
the
prisoner
flight
was
not
made
until
baker
knocked
on
lady
saxondale
door
and
inquired
for
miss
garrison
at
bedtime
then
it
was
recalled
that
she
had
left
the
others
at
nine
pleading
a
headache
but
she
did
not
go
to
her
room
investigation
revealed
the
fact
that
her
jewelry
a
cape
and
a
traveling
hat
were
missing
remembering
her
first
attempt
to
escape
and
recalling
the
very
apparent
nervousness
that
marked
her
demeanor
during
the
day
lady
saxondale
alarmed
the
house
ten
minutes
later
the
conspirators
and
a
knot
of
sleepy
servants
stood
in
the
courtyard
staring
at
the
great
gate
it
was
closed
but
unlocked
there
were
but
two
known
keys
to
the
big
lock
and
since
the
arrival
of
the
party
at
the
castle
they
had
not
been
out
of
lord
saxondale
possession
the
girl
could
not
have
used
either
of
them
and
the
lock
had
not
been
forced
what
wonder
then
that
in
the
first
moments
of
bewilderment
they
shrank
back
as
if
opposed
by
the
supernatural
no
one
present
had
seen
her
leave
the
castle
and
there
was
no
way
of
telling
how
long
she
had
been
gone
except
that
it
was
not
longer
than
two
hours
after
the
first
shock
of
realization
however
the
men
came
to
the
conclusion
that
assistance
had
come
from
the
outside
or
that
there
was
a
traitor
on
the
inside
they
were
excitedly
questioning
the
servants
when
lady
jane
made
a
second
discovery
where
is
turk
she
cried
and
every
eye
swept
through
the
group
gone
by
god
exclaimed
quentin
in
helpless
amazement
no
one
had
given
thought
to
his
illness
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
had
been
called
forth
with
the
rest
and
when
he
coughed
not
even
he
took
note
of
the
fact
this
was
no
time
to
think
of
colds
and
fevers
and
such
a
trifling
thing
as
death
he
shivered
but
it
was
not
with
the
chill
of
a
sick
man
it
was
the
shiver
of
fear
good
lord
he
ca
be
the
one
turk
would
die
for
me
he
cried
almost
piteously
he
is
gone
and
so
is
she
grated
lord
bob
what
are
we
to
infer
he
has
sold
us
out
quentin
that
the
truth

damned

hoot
for

but
lady
saxondale
and
great
heaven
what
have
i
brought
you
to
in
my
folly
groaned
quentin
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
open
the
gate
called
a
hoarse
voice
outside
the
wall
and
every
heart
stopped
beating
every
face
went
white
a
heavy
boot
crashed
against
the
gate
the
officers
whispered
lady
jane
in
terror
dickey
savage
arm
went
round
her
let
me
in
git
a
move
on
it
turk
roared
quentin
springing
toward
the
gate
an
instant
later
turk
was
sprawling
inside
the
circle
of
light
shed
by
the
lantern
and
a
voices
were
hurling
questions
at
him
the
little
man
was
in
a
sorry
plight
he
was
and
bloody
and
he
was
so
full
of
blasphemy
that
he
choked
in
suppressing
it
where
is
she
where
have
you
been
cried
quentin
shaking
him
violently
in
his
agitation

it
that
french
detective
courant
an
he
worked
us
to
a
he
th
boy
this
startling
news
threw
the
party
into
deeper
consternation
than
before
the
little
was
not
a
fluent
talker
at
best
but
he
now
excelled
himself
in
brevity
in
three
minutes
he
had
concluded
his
story
and
preparations
were
well
under
way
for
the
pursuit
he
was
according
to
his
narrative
sitting
in
the
lower
end
of
the
courtyard
about
nine
calmly
smoking
his
pipe
when
his
attention
was
caught
by
the
long
shrill
call
of
a
night
bird
no
such
sound
had
come
to
his
ears
during
his
stay
at
the
castle
and
his
curiosity
was
aroused
not
dreaming
of
what
was
to
follow
he
slowly
walked
toward
the
front
of
the
castle
a
woman
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
near
the
gate
hardly
had
his
eyes
made
out
the
dim
figure
when
the
whistle
was
repeated
before
he
fully
grasped
the
situation
the
big
gate
swung
slowly
inward
and
another
figure
at
first
glance
that
of
a
woman
stood
inside
the
wall
he
heard
the
woman
call
softly
is
that
you
father
a
man
voice
replied
but
the
words
were
too
low
to
be
distinguished
the
woman
drew
back
as
if
to
return
to
the
house
but
the
newcomer
was
at
her
side
and
his
hand
was
on
her
arm
there
was
a
moment
of
indecision
then
resistance
two
or
three
sharp
words
from
the
man
and
then
the
two
seemed
to
fade
through
the
wall
the
ponderous
gate
was
closing
before
the
dumbfounded
watcher
could
collect
his
wits
like
a
shot
he
was
across
the
stones
now
alive
to
the
meaning
of
the
strange
proceeding
with
desperate
hands
he
grasped
the
bar
of
the
gate
and
pulled
uttering
a
loud
shout
of
alarm
at
the
same
time
surprised
by
the
sudden
interference
the
man
on
the
other
side
gave
way
and
turk
was
through
the
opening
and
upon
him
a
stunning
blow
on
the
head
met
him
as
he
hurled
himself
forward
and
he
plunged
headlong
to
the
ground
as
he
struggled
to
his
feet
another
blow
fell
and
then
all
was
darkness
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
two
figures
were
careening
down
the
steep
path
a
hundred
yards
away
they
were
running
and
were
plainly
distinguishable
in
the
moonlight
turk
knew
that
the
woman
was
dorothy
garrison
he
had
heard
her
cry
after
the
first
blow
do
do
kill
him
father
it
is
turk
crazed
with
anger
and
determined
to
recapture
her
turk
neglected
to
call
for
help
with
the
blood
streaming
down
his
face
he
dashed
off
in
pursuit
there
was
in
his
heart
the
desire
to
kill
the
man
who
had
struck
him
down
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
came
up
with
them
and
he
was
like
a
wildcat
miss
garrison
had
fallen
to
her
knees
and
was
moaning
as
if
in
pain
the
priest
crouched
behind
her
protecting
his
person
from
a
possible
shot
from
the
pursuer
for
god
sake
do
shoot
him
screamed
the
girl
but
a
moment
later
there
was
a
flash
of
light
a
report
and
a
pistol
ball
whizzed
by
turk
ear
he
was
unarmed
but
he
did
not
stop
throwing
himself
forward
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
grasp
the
crouching
priest
hoping
to
prevent
the
firing
of
another
shot
but
he
had
not
reckoned
on
the
cleverness
of
the
man
at
bay
the
priest
dropped
flat
to
the
ground
and
turk
plunged
over
his
body
wildly
clutching
for
the
prostrate
man
as
he
went
with
the
cunning
of
a
fox
the
priest
on
realizing
that
he
could
not
avoid
a
personal
conflict
had
looked
about
for
means
to
end
the
pursuit
effectually
retarded
in
his
progress
by
the
tired
trembling
girl
he
saw
that
a
stand
against
the
oncomer
was
unavoidable
he
cleverly
selected
the
spot
for
this
stand
and
braced
himself
as
for
the
onslaught
scarcely
a
yard
beyond
his
position
there
was
a
sharp
declivity
among
the
rocks
with
a
clear
drop
of
a
dozen
feet
or
more
to
the
bottom
of
a
wide
crevasse
his
shot
went
wild
and
he
could
not
repeat
it
for
dorothy
was
frantically
clutching
his
arm
the
strategem
worked
well
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
a
mighty
oath
as
turk
unable
to
check
himself
slipped
from
the
edge
and
went
crashing
to
the
rocks
below
with
the
speed
of
a
hunted
animal
the
priest
leaped
to
his
feet
dragging
the
girl
after
him
and
a
harsh
laugh
came
from
his
throat
as
they
dashed
onward
a
quick
glance
behind
showed
there
had
been
but
one
pursuer
and
the
man
in
the
robes
of
holiness
chuckled
exultantly
but
if
dorothy
garrison
believed
him
to
be
the
priest
his
robes
declared
the
moonlight
told
the
fallen
turk
the
truth
indeed
it
was
the
intentness
with
which
the
little
gazed
upon
the
white
face
of
courant
that
prevented
him
from
seeing
the
ledge
as
he
dashed
up
to
the
couple
how
long
it
was
afterward
that
turk
came
to
his
senses
and
crawled
back
to
the
roadway
dizzy
weak
and
defeated
he
knew
not
he
could
only
groan
and
gnash
his
teeth
when
he
stood
erect
again
and
saw
that
he
was
utterly
alone
courant
and
the
girl
were
gone
in
shame
and
humiliation
he
climbed
the
hill
to
call
for
help
just
as
the
searching
party
was
about
to
rush
recklessly
from
the
courtyard
servants
having
been
instructed
to
bring
out
the
horses
lady
jane
espied
a
white
piece
of
paper
on
the
ground
near
the
gate
and
then
it
was
that
they
read
the
parting
message
from
the
girl
who
was
gone
with
a
trembling
voice
lady
saxondale
read
i
have
found
a
way
and
i
am
going
if
nothing
prevents
with
the
help
of
my
good
angel
i
shall
soon
be
far
from
this
place
a
holy
man
in
passing
saw
my
signal
of
distress
and
promised
rescue
you
have
been
good
to
me
and
i
can
only
repay
you
by
refusing
to
expose
you
this
priest
does
not
know
who
you
are
i
shall
not
tell
him
or
any
who
may
be
with
him
no
one
shall
ever
know
from
me
that
you
were
my
abductors
god
grant
that
you
may
never
have
to
pay
the
penalty
go
while
you
may
for
the
truth
may
become
known
without
my
help
and

exclaimed
lord

he
has
gone
up
the
valley
headed
for
one
of
the
little
towns
and
will
steer
clear
of
the
luxemburg

for
fear
they
may
demand
a
part
of
the
god
saxondale
are
those
horses
never

fumed
quentin
i
wo
wait
and
he
was
off
like
a
madman
through
the
gate
and
down
the
steep
behind
him
tore
turk
the
faithful
xxviii
the
game
of
the
priest
when
turk
pitched
over
the
crouching
form
of
the
priest
and
into
the
dark
chasm
beyond
dorothy
for
the
first
time
began
to
appreciate
the
character
of
her
cowled
rescuer
panting
and
terrified
she
looked
into
his
hideously
exultant
face
as
he
rose
and
peered
over
the
ledge
after
the
luckless
pursuer
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
holy
man
of
god
but
that
of
a
creature
who
could
laugh
in
the
taking
of
a
human
life
come
on
he
cried
grasping
her
by
the
wrist
with
no
gentle
regard
he
out
of
the
way
but
we
have
no
time
to
lose
the
others
may
miss
you
at
any
moment
and
we
must
be
in
the
wood
if
we
hope
to
fool
i
have
changed
my
mind
she
began
holding
back
as
he
dragged
her
after
him
down
the
slope
it
is
too
late
he
said
harshly
you
will
soon
be
with
your
friends
my
child
do
not
lose
heart
but
trust
to
who
are
you
you
are
not
a
priest
why
have
you
disguised
yourself
not
so
loud
my
child
not
so
loud
they
may
have
guards
even
here
if
i
am
not
a
priest
then
may
heaven
shut
its
gates
on
me
forever
because
i
am
a
man
and
have
undone
one
of
your
enemies
you
should
not
question
my
calling
it
is
no
time
for
prayer
when
we
are
safe
from
pursuit
you
will
regret
the
doubt
you
have
just
expressed
trust
to
me
my
child
but
run
for
god
sake
run
do
hang
back
when
all
depends
on
our
speed
in
the
next
where
are
you
taking
me
answer
or
i
shall
refuse
to
go
another
step
with
you
she
exclaimed
now
thoroughly
aroused
and
determined
my
wagon
is
hitched
in
the
wood
over
there
in
it
we
will
go
to
a
town
up
the
valley
where
i
have
the
promise
of
help
i
could
have
brought
a
big
force
of
men
with
me
but
do
you
see
what
a
mistake
it
would
have
been
rather
than
surrender
you
to
a
force
they
would
have
killed
you
and
secreted
your
body
in
the
passages
under
the
castle
it
is
commonly
known
that
the
cellars
are
paved
with
here
dorothy
shuddered
in
recollection
strategy
was
the
only
means
of
getting
you
out
they
would
not
have
killed
me
she
cried
breathlessly
they
were
moving
rapidly
along
the
level
roadway
now
and
his
grip
on
her
wrist
was
like
a
clasp
of
iron
to
save
themselves
of
course
they
would
as
they
would
a
dog
he
said
they
are
my
friends
and
they
are
the
best
the
truest
in
the
world
she
gasped
eager
to
keep
the
promise
of
protection
made
in
the
farewell
note
you
think
they
are
madam
but
how
could
they
treat
you
as
they
have
if
they
are
friends
he
had
turned
into
the
wood
and
it
was
necessary
to
proceed
more
cautiously
on
account
of
the
darkness
she
realized
that
she
had
erred
in
saying
they
were
friends
and
turned
cold
with
apprehension
i
mean
they
treated
me
well
for
criminals
she
managed
to
say
criminals
he
snarled
bah
of
course
they
are
criminals
of
the
worst
kind
but
they
will
never
be
i
afraid
they
are
so
clever
that
no
one
will
ever
find
out
who
they
really
he
stopped
with
a
lurch
and
she
could
feel
that
he
was
looking
at
her
in
amazement
i
know
who
they
are
and
you
know
them
too
he
said
slowly
perhaps
nobody
else
knows
but
we
know
that
my
lord
and
lady
saxondale
and
the
two
americans
were
your
abductors
the
man
i
dumped
into
the
ravine
was
that
little
villain
her
heart
almost
stopped
beating
with
the
shock
of
knowing
that
nothing
could
now
shield
her
captors
from
exposure
but
but
it
will
be
very
hard
to
prove
she
said
hoarsely
almost
defiantly
you
have
only
to
take
oath
he
said
meaningly
i
do
know
the
name
or
face
of
a
person
in
that
castle
she
said
deliberately
he
was
silent
for
a
full
minute
you
intend
to
shield
them
he
demanded
there
was
no
answer
to
the
question
now
she
was
positive
that
the
man
was
no
priest
but
some
one
who
knew
the
world
and
who
had
made
it
his
business
to
trace
her
and
her
captors
to
the
very
gates
of
the
castle
if
he
knew
then
others
must
also
be
in
possession
of
the
secret
who
are
you
she
demanded
as
he
drew
her
deeper
into
the
wood
there
was
now
the
wild
desire
to
escape
from
her
rescuer
and
to
fly
back
to
the
kindly
jailers
on
the
hill
a
poor
priest
by
the
grace
of
god
he
said
and
she
heard
him
chuckle
take
me
back
to
the
road
sir
she
commanded
i
will
take
you
to
your
mother
he
said
and
to
no
one
but
i
am
afraid
of
you
she
exclaimed
her
courage
going
i
know
you
i
do
know
where
you
are
taking
we
will
not
go
far
i
know
a
place
where
you
can
hide
until
i
secure
help
from
the
but
you
said
you
had
a
the
horse
must
have
strayed
away
worse
luck
said
he
with
a
raucous
laugh
she
broke
from
his
grasp
suddenly
and
like
a
frightened
deer
was
off
through
the
darkness
knowing
not
whither
she
went
or
what
moment
she
might
crash
against
a
tree
the
flight
was
a
short
one
she
heard
him
curse
savagely
as
he
leaped
upon
her
from
behind
after
a
chase
of
a
few
rods
and
then
she
swooned
dead
away
when
she
regained
consciousness
a
faint
glow
of
light
met
her
eyes
as
the
lids
feebly
lifted
themselves
from
their
torpor
gradually
there
came
to
her
nostrils
a
dank
musty
odor
and
then
the
smell
of
tobacco
smoke
she
was
lying
on
her
back
and
her
eyes
at
last
began
to
take
in
broad
rafters
and
cobwebby
timbers
not
far
above
her
head
the
light
was
so
dim
that
shadows
and
not
real
objects
seemed
to
constitute
the
surroundings
then
there
grew
the
certainty
that
she
was
not
alone
in
this
dismal
place
turning
her
head
slightly
she
was
able
with
some
effort
to
distinguish
the
figure
of
a
man
seated
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
low
square
room
his
back
against
the
wall
his
legs
outstretched
at
his
elbow
on
a
box
burned
a
candle
flickering
and
feeble
in
its
worthlessness
he
was
smoking
a
pipe
and
there
was
about
him
an
air
of
contentment
and
security
slowly
past
events
crowded
themselves
into
the
path
of
memory
and
her
brain
took
them
up
as
if
they
were
parts
of
a
dream
for
many
minutes
she
was
perfectly
quiet
dumbly
contemplating
the
stranger
who
sat
guard
over
her
in
that
wretched
place
in
her
mind
there
was
quickly
developed
as
one
brings
the
picture
from
the
film
of
a
negative
the
truth
of
the
situation
she
had
escaped
from
one
set
of
captors
only
to
give
herself
into
the
clutches
of
others
a
thousand
times
more
detestable
infinitely
more
you
come
back
to
life
have
you
she
started
violently
and
shivered
as
with
a
mighty
chill
at
the
sound
of
these
words
they
came
from
the
slouching
smoker
where
am
i
she
cried
sitting
up
a
dizzy
whirling
in
her
head
her
bed
was
no
more
than
a
heavy
piece
of
old
carpet
in
the
house
of
your
friends
laconically
responded
the
voice
now
quite
familiar
her
eyes
swept
the
room
in
search
of
the
priest
his
robes
lay
in
a
heap
across
her
feet
where
is
father
paul
she
demanded
he
is
no
more
said
the
man
in
sombre
tones
i
was
he
until
an
hour
and
you
are
no
priest
ah
god
help
me
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
come
to
in
my
miserable
folly
she
cried
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
look
here
miss
garrison
said
the
man
quietly
i
am
no
priest
but
you
have
nothing
to
fear
because
of
that
fact
the
truth
is
i
am
a
detective
for
a
month
i
was
in
the
employ
of
prince
ravorelli
and
it
was
no
honest
business
i
can
tell
you
what
i
have
done
is
straight
and
honest
i
mean
you
no
harm
and
you
have
but
to
follow
my
instructions
in
order
to
find
yourself
safe
in
brussels
once
more
i
have
been
interested
in
a
number
of
queer
transactions
but
let
me
say
this
in
my
own
defence
i
was
never
employed
in
any
game
so
detestable
so
low
as
the
one
your
noble
prince
was
playing
when
you
were
snatched
away
from
him
the
only
regret
i
have
in
taking
you
back
to
your
mother
comes
from
the
fear
that
you
may
go
ahead
and
marry
that
dorothy
was
listening
with
wide
eyes
and
bated
breath
to
the
words
of
the
lounging
smoker
i
will
never
never
marry
him
she
cried
vehemently
stick
to
that
resolve
my
child
said
courant
with
mock
benevolence
he
is
a
scoundrel
and
i
cut
loose
from
him
to
do
this
little
job
down
here
on
my
own
tell
me
if
you
know
did
he
plan
to
kill
quentin
i
must
have
the
truth
she
cried
eagerly
he
did
worse
than
that
he
made
the
attempt
or
rather
his
agents
did
you
see
quentin
was
a
dangerous
rival
because
he
knew
too
i
do
well
he
knew
all
about
the
prince
when
he
was
with
the
opera
company
in
brazil
i
ca
tell
you
much
about
it
but
there
was
a
murder
committed
over
there
and
your
prince
was
believed
to
be
guilty
a
woman
was
killed
i
believe
quentin
knew
all
about
it
it
and
never
told
me
she
cried
he
was
not
positive
i
suppose
there
was
the
danger
of
being
mistaken
and
this
american
friend
of
yours
seems
honest
he
only
told
you
what
he
knew
to
be
a
fact
i
yesterday
i
heard
that
a
woman
had
been
murdered
in
brussels
a
woman
who
came
to
warn
me
against
the
prince
do
you
know
who
killed
her
good
god
has
she
been
killed
ah
i
knew
it
would
come
he
was
obliged
to
get
rid
of
her
i
did
not
know
of
her
death
but
i
leave
you
to
guess
who
was
responsible
for
it
god
he
is
a
devil
you
owe
a
great
deal
mademoiselle
to
the
clever
men
who
stole
you
from
alas
i
am
beginning
to
know
it
now
that
it
is
too
late
and
he
was
ill
when
i
stole
away
i
implore
you
take
me
back
to
the
castle
she
pleaded
her
heart
wrung
by
the
anguish
in
her
soul
so
he
is
in
the
castle
eh
just
as
i
thought
i
like
to
take
you
to
him
especially
as
he
is
ill
but
i
must
take
care
of
number
one
when
i
dropped
out
of
one
villain
employment
i
went
into
business
for
myself
you
see
there
is
about
francs
reward
for
you
and
there
is
the
same
for
the
bodies
of
the
abductors
if
i
turn
you
over
to
your
mother
or
her
agents
not
the
prince
by
the
way
i
earn
the
reward
if
i
can
procure
the
arrest
of
your
abductors
i
get
double
the
amount
you
see
how
it
would
be
if
i
were
to
let
my
sympathies
get
the
better
of
but
i
will
give
you
francs
if
you
will
take
me
back
to
the
castle
she
cried
standing
before
him
have
you
the
money
with
you
of
course
i
have
not
but
it
shall
be
yours
as
soon
as
i
can
pardon
you
are
worth
nothing
to
me
in
that
castle
and
you
will
bring
a
fortune
in
in
vain
she
pleaded
with
the
stubborn
detective
finally
threatening
him
with
dire
punishment
if
he
refused
to
accede
to
her
demands
then
he
arose
in
sudden
wrath
cursing
her
roundly
and
vowing
she
should
not
leave
the
room
alive
if
she
persisted
in
such
threats
he
told
her
that
she
was
in
a
cave
beneath
the
ruins
of
an
old
church
long
the
haunt
of
robbers
now
the
home
of
snakes
and
bats
indeed
as
he
spoke
a
flittermouse
scurried
through
the
air
within
a
foot
of
her
ear
we
rest
here
until
night
and
then
we
start
out
to
walk
you
can
not
be
seen
in
that
dress
either
i
have
clothing
here
in
this
box
for
you
to
wear
my
dear
young
lady
you
must
make
believe
that
you
are
my
younger
brother
for
a
day
or
two
at
a
look
of
horror
came
into
her
face
succeeded
by
the
deep
red
of
insulted
modesty
and
then
the
white
of
indignation
i
will
die
first
you
wretch
she
exclaimed
in
that
moment
she
believed
she
could
have
killed
the
smiling
rogue
with
her
own
hands
we
shall
see
he
said
roughly
look
at
them
they
are
respectable
in
cut
and
they
are
he
drew
the
garments
from
the
box
piece
by
piece
and
held
them
before
her
flaming
face
going
out
to
take
a
look
about
the
valley
you
are
quite
safe
here
no
one
knows
where
you
are
and
the
robbers
have
been
dead
for
twenty
years
one
of
them
still
has
his
skeleton
in
the
room
just
off
this
one
but
he
is
a
harmless
old
fellow
in
an
hour
i
will
return
and
we
will
eat
it
is
now
three
and
the
sun
will
soon
be
rising
we
venture
forth
as
brothers
he
pulled
his
cap
down
over
his
eyes
buttoned
his
coat
about
his
throat
changed
a
revolver
from
one
pocket
to
another
and
deliberately
stalked
across
the
room
to
the
narrow
door
an
instant
later
she
heard
the
key
rasp
in
the
lock
and
she
was
alone
oh
heaven
if
philip
quentin
could
see
me
now
if
he
could
but
hear
my
sobs
and
see
my
tears
how
he
would
rejoice
how
he
would
laugh
how
he
would
pity
me
this
is
your
triumph
philip
quentin
but
you
are
not
here
to
claim
the
wretched
victory
fool
fool
fool
she
had
thrown
herself
face
downward
on
the
patch
of
carpet
and
was
writhing
in
the
agony
of
fear
and
regret
suddenly
there
came
to
her
ears
the
distant
report
of
a
firearm
the
rush
of
feet
and
then
something
heavy
crashed
against
the
little
door
she
was
on
her
feet
in
an
instant
cowering
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
her
face
among
the
cobwebs
panic
seized
her
and
she
screamed
aloud
in
her
terror
outside
the
door
there
were
sounds
of
a
savage
struggle
but
they
rapidly
became
indistinct
and
finally
passed
beyond
hearing
altogether
she
ran
to
the
door
and
pounded
on
it
with
hands
that
knew
not
the
bruises
they
were
acquiring
and
she
moaned
in
the
fear
that
the
rescuers
for
such
they
surely
must
be
were
leaving
her
behind
phil
phil
she
cried
again
and
again
but
there
suddenly
came
to
her
a
terrifying
thought
and
she
fell
back
cold
and
voiceless
ugo
what
if
he
had
at
last
run
the
treacherous
courant
to
earth
what
if
the
rescuer
were
he
she
slunk
away
from
the
door
the
dampness
of
dread
sending
a
chill
to
her
heart
and
when
again
the
rush
of
footsteps
brought
a
heavy
body
against
the
door
she
had
not
the
voice
to
cry
out
so
sure
was
she
that
ugo
ravorelli
was
coming
to
her
in
that
dismal
hole
then
the
door
gave
way
and
philip
quentin
came
plunging
into
the
room
hatless
coatless
his
shirt
in
shreds
the
mighty
draft
of
air
from
the
open
door
killed
the
sickly
but
not
before
they
had
seen
each
other
for
the
second
time
that
night
she
lost
consciousness
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
ravine
lay
the
body
of
courant
he
had
fled
from
before
the
two
adversaries
after
a
vain
attempt
to
reenter
the
room
below
the
church
and
had
blindly
dashed
over
the
cliff
turk
with
more
charity
than
courant
had
shown
not
many
hours
before
climbed
down
the
dangerous
steep
and
in
horror
touched
his
quivering
hand
then
came
the
last
gasp
xxix
dorothy
solution
quentin
carried
her
forth
into
the
night
when
turk
came
upon
him
in
the
darkness
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
wandering
about
the
hilltop
the
limp
figure
of
the
woman
he
loved
in
his
arms
calling
upon
her
to
speak
to
him
to
forgive
him
the
little
man
checked
him
just
in
time
to
prevent
an
ugly
fall
over
a
steep
embankment
my
god
she
dead
turk
he
groaned
placing
her
tenderly
on
the
grassy
sward
and
supporting
her
head
with
his
arm
the
wretch
has
killed
he
paid
for
it
if
he
did
i
guess
it
nothin
but
a
faint
er
a
fit
does
she
have
fits
demanded
turk
earnestly
quentin
paid
no
heed
to
him
but
feverishly
began
working
with
her
hope
springing
from
turk
surmise
turk
if
she
dies
i
swear
to
god
i
kill
myself
this
night

th
man
wo

fer
it
a
turk
was
kneeling
opposite
quentin
and
was
scratching
match
after
match
holding
them
above
the
pale
face
until
they
burnt
his
finger
tips
when
dorothy
at
last
opened
her
eyes
she
looked
into
the
most
terrifying
face
she
had
ever
seen
and
as
the
lids
closed
again
spasmodically
a
moan
came
from
her
lips
turk
bristled
face
was
covered
with
blood
that
had
dried
hours
ago
and
he
was
a
most
uncanny
object
to
look
upon
darn
me
she
askeert
of
my
mug
duck
ontil
you
puts
her
look
up
dorothy
it
is
phil
do
be
afraid
dearest
you
are
safe
he
knew
that
her
eyes
were
open
again
although
it
was
too
dark
to
see
them
is
it
you
phil
she
whispered
yes
yes
where
is
where
is
he
in
terror
he
can
not
harm
you
now
he
is
but
i
saw
his
face
just
now
oh
you
are
not
telling
me
the
truth
you
saw
turk
face
dearest
what
a
time
we
had
in
finding
you
but
you
are
safe
now
thank
god
she
lay
very
still
striving
to
convince
herself
that
she
was
awake
and
that
she
was
really
listening
to
philip
quentin
voice
hoarse
and
eager
her
hand
went
to
his
face
impulsively
searching
for
the
features
her
eyes
could
not
see
strong
ringers
seized
it
and
dry
burning
lips
kissed
it
again
and
again
lips
parched
with
fever
the
heart
of
the
woman
asserted
itself
at
once
and
concern
succeeded
perplexity
oh
phil
you
are
ill
you
should
not
be
here
she
cried
in
distress
and
before
he
could
prevent
she
was
on
her
feet
swaying
dizzily
then
you
are
not
hurt
he
cried
thank
god
for
that
his
arm
was
about
her
waist
and
a
wave
of
security
and
contentment
rolled
through
her
being
take
me
back
to
the
castle
phil
she
said
simply
you
will
never
know
how
unhappy
i
have
been
how
i
have
blamed
myself
for
running
away
as
i
did
but
oh
i
thought
he
was
a
priest
and
i
wanted
to
prove
that
you
could
not
keep
me
you
do
not
have
to
stay
there
dorothy
he
said
slowly
what
do
you
mean
i
have
been
a
fool
an
ingrate
a
brute
but
i
will
atone
if
it
is
possible
in
your
note
you
said
you
would
forgive
the
others
i
do
ask
pardon
for
myself
but
i
implore
you
to
shield
them
perhaps
it
is
too
late
this
detective
has
exposed
us
he
swore
to
me
that
he
had
not
but
he
knows
everything
and
may
carry
the
word
to
the
authorities
she
interrupted
in
distress
the
secret
is
safe
if
he
worked
alone
for
he
is
dead
do
be
frightened
he
fell
over
a
cliff
in
the
darkness
turk
here
we
must
get
back
to
the
castle
as
soon
as
possible
it
is
five
miles
at
least
try
to
find
a
trap
of
some
sort
at
once
miss
garrison
can
not
walk
that
but
i
can
and
will
she
objected
i
am
not
hurt
and
i
am
stronger
than
nonsense
i
all
right
i
will
return
with
you
to
brussels
your
imprisonment
is
at
an
end
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
think
again
of
escape
for
you
are
free
to
go
at
this
moment
come
back
to
lady
saxondale
for
a
while
though
and
when
you
are
able
to
go
with
me
we
will
take
the
train
for
brussels
believe
me
i
am
sorry
but
i
am
not
fool
enough
to
ask
you
to
forgive
i
deserve
pardon
perhaps
but
i
know
that
my
heart
was
in
the
right
and
that
i
saved
you
from
a
much
worse
bondage
than
that
which
you
have
spent
in
castle
as
if
in
a
dream
she
walked
with
him
through
the
first
faint
light
of
the
dawning
day
stunned
by
the
unexpected
words
he
had
uttered
in
her
mind
there
began
to
grow
rebelliously
the
fear
that
he
would
do
as
he
said
turk
following
close
behind
suddenly
gave
a
loud
shout
and
sped
away
like
a
flash
in
front
of
them
it
savage
he
yelled
back
to
the
startled
couple
an
on
horseback
hi
there
as
dickey
savage
came
plunging
up
the
slope
roaring
with
excited
joy
she
said
to
ouentin
her
voice
low
and
intense
i
know
now
that
you
saved
me
from
a
worse
fate
than
death
phil
and
if
you
ask
i
will
forgive
as
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
courant
was
ugo
tool
and
i
had
the
truth
from
him
you
are
the
truest
the
best
of
friends
and
i
should
stop
dorothy
not
now
some
day
when
you
are
home
after
you
have
had
time
to
think
over
all
that
i
have
done
right
and
wrong
i
may
come
to
you
with
the
question
i
will
not
ask
now
what
i
have
sinned
for
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
i
will
sue
for
some
other
day
when
the
world
is
looking
on
i
will
not
make
my
prisoner
pay
penalty
without
a
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
do
not
hate
you
she
argued
persistently
but
you
hated
me
i
did
just
then
dickey
pounced
upon
them
and
as
they
hurried
to
the
spot
where
turk
was
holding
the
newcomer
horse
phil
briefly
told
how
he
and
the
little
had
accidentally
stumbled
upon
the
of
the
pseudo
priest
after
hours
of
hopeless
search
the
two
pursuers
tired
and
despairing
were
lying
on
the
ground
in
front
of
the
church
ruins
taking
a
few
moments
of
rest
before
climbing
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
when
the
luckless
courant
ventured
forth
with
quick
intuition
turk
called
out
the
detective
name
and
the
ruse
worked
the
man
they
could
not
see
gave
a
snort
of
dismay
and
turned
to
reenter
the
door
and
then
came
his
undoing
turk
was
the
general
who
planned
the
return
to
the
castle
he
insisted
that
quentin
who
was
very
weak
take
miss
garrison
upon
the
horse
back
and
ride
while
he
and
savage
walked
in
this
way
they
reached
the
gates
of
craneycrow
it
was
like
the
of
loved
ones
who
had
been
absent
for
years
three
women
were
in
tears
and
all
of
the
men
were
in
smiles
quentin
was
the
smile
of
one
bordering
on
delirium
however
a
chill
broke
over
him
and
the
fever
in
his
body
renewed
its
disputed
sway
an
hour
later
he
was
in
bed
and
turk
dispatched
by
dorothy
garrison
was
riding
to
the
nearest
town
for
a
physician
much
against
the
wishes
of
the
sick
man
he
stubbornly
insisted
that
he
would
start
with
her
for
brussels
within
hours
and
it
was
not
until
the
doctor
told
him
that
he
was
in
extreme
danger
of
pneumonia
that
he
consented
to
keep
to
his
bed
resolutely
he
checked
all
desire
to
cry
his
love
into
the
ear
of
the
gentle
nurse
who
sat
with
him
for
hours
he
would
not
grant
himself
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
course
he
had
sworn
to
follow
and
he
suffered
more
from
restraint
than
from
fever
she
found
herself
longing
for
the
moment
when
he
would
call
her
to
him
and
pour
out
the
love
that
would
not
be
denied
he
never
spoke
but
she
hoped
for
signs
of
surrender
he
never
looked
at
her
that
she
did
not
expect
his
lips
to
utter
the
story
his
eyes
were
telling
what
he
endured
in
that
week
of
fever
under
the
strain
of
love
nursing
only
he
could
have
told
and
he
told
nothing
how
she
hungered
for
the
luxury
of
one
word
only
she
knew
and
confessed
unconsciously
had
the
doctor
told
her
that
he
was
critically
ill
she
would
have
cast
all
restraint
aside
and
wrung
from
him
the
words
he
was
holding
back
but
the
unromantic
little
doctor
calmly
broke
the
fever
subdued
the
congestion
relieved
the
cough
and
told
them
that
the
young
man
would
be
quite
well
in
a
few
days
if
he
took
good
care
of
the
days
of
convalescence
were
few
for
the
vigorous
strength
of
the
patient
had
not
been
sapped
to
any
great
extent
they
were
days
of
happiness
however
for
all
who
lived
in
castle
craneycrow
dickey
and
lady
jane
solemnly
and
somewhat
defiantly
approached
lord
bob
on
a
very
important
matter
he
solemnly
and
discreetly
gave
his
consent
and
dickey
promised
to
be
very
very
good
to
her
so
long
as
he
lived
one
day
a
real
priest
father
bivot
came
to
the
castle
gates
to
solicit
alms
for
the
poor
of
the
neighborhood
he
was
admitted
refreshed
and
made
glad
by
a
single
donation
that
surpassed
in
size
the
combined
contributions
of
a
whole
valley
it
was
from
him
that
they
learned
with
no
little
uneasiness
of
mind
that
the
body
of
courant
had
been
found
and
that
it
had
been
identified
by
the
luxemburg
authorities
the
cause
of
his
death
was
a
mystery
that
defied
solution
however
the
news
that
courant
had
been
found
and
identified
made
quentin
all
the
more
eager
to
carry
out
his
design
to
restore
dorothy
to
her
mother
he
knew
and
all
knew
that
it
was
but
a
question
of
a
few
days
until
ugo
and
the
police
would
put
two
and
two
together
and
come
racing
into
the
valley
certain
that
courant
had
been
killed
by
the
abductors
of
dorothy
garrison
one
morning
therefore
shortly
after
the
visit
of
father
bivot
he
asked
lord
saxondale
for
the
use
of
a
conveyance
announcing
his
intention
to
drive
with
dorothy
to
the
nearest
railway
station
there
was
dismay
in
the
heart
of
everyone
who
sat
at
what
had
been
a
cheerful
breakfast
table
quentin
deliberately
went
on
to
say
that
he
would
take
no
lackey
preferring
to
expose
none
but
himself
in
the
undertaking
can
you
be
ready
in
an
hour
dorothy
he
asked
after
saxondale
had
reluctantly
consented
do
you
insist
on
carrying
out
this
quixotic
plan
phil
she
asked
after
a
long
pause
then
i
can
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
she
said
leaving
the
table
abruptly
confound
it
phil
she
rather
stay
here
said
dickey
miserably
i
intend
to
restore
her
to
her
mother
just
the
same
there
no
use
discussing
it
dickey
if
they
do
throw
me
into
jail
at
brussels
i
may
return
in
a
day
or
there
was
a
faint
flush
in
dorothy
cheeks
as
she
bade
to
the
party
lady
saxondale
sagely
remarked
as
the
trap
rolled
out
of
sight
among
the
trees
below
the
castle
that
the
flush
was
product
of
resentment
and
dickey
offered
to
wager
that
she
would
be
an
engaged
girl
before
she
reached
brussels
do
you
know
the
road
phil
asked
dorothy
after
they
had
gone
quite
a
distance
in
silence
she
looked
back
as
she
spoke
and
her
eyes
uttered
a
mute
farewell
to
the
grim
old
pile
of
stone
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
father
bivot
gave
me
minute
directions
yesterday
and
i
ca
miss
the
way
it
rather
a
long
drive
dorothy
and
a
tiresome
one
for
you
perhaps
but
the
scenery
is
pretty
and
the
shade
of
the
forest
will
make
us
think
we
are
again
in
the
bois
de
la
cambre
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
go
to
brussels
she
said
after
another
long
period
of
silence
in
which
she
painfully
sought
for
means
to
dissuade
him
from
entering
the
city
she
was
thinking
of
the
big
reward
for
his
capture
and
of
the
greedy
officials
who
could
not
be
denied
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
the
consequences
he
asked
bitterly
she
looked
at
the
white
face
and
the
set
jaws
and
despaired
you
are
not
afraid
of
course
but
why
should
you
be
foolhardy
why
not
put
me
in
the
coach
for
brussels
and
avoid
the
risk
of
being
seized
by
the
police
i
can
travel
alone
if
you
are
taken
how
can
you
or
i
explain
she
went
on
eagerly
you
have
promised
to
shield
the
rest
he
said
briefly
i
know
but
i
want
to
shield
you
have
i
told
you
that
i
forgive
everything
do
make
me
unhappy
phil
it
would
kill
me
now
if
you
were
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police
they
are
crazy
to
catch
my
abductors
and
do
you
remember
what
the
paper
said
it
said
the
people
would
kill
without
mercy
please
phil
for
my
sake
do
go
to
brussels
it
is
so
unnecessary
and
so
pray
tell
me
what
explanation
you
could
give
to
your
mother
to
the
police
to
the
newspapers
if
you
suddenly
appeared
in
brussels
safe
and
sound
and
yet
unable
to
tell
who
had
been
your
captors
or
where
you
have
been
held
he
grimly
said
i
would
not
offer
an
explanation
she
said
decisively
as
if
that
settled
everything
but
you
would
be
compelled
to
make
some
statement
my
dear
girl
you
could
drop
in
there
as
if
from
the
sky
and
not
tell
where
you
have
been
and
with
whom
the
truth
would
be
demanded
and
you
could
not
refuse
what
would
the
world
your
mother
the
prince
think
do
mention
that
man
name
to
me
she
cried
well
what
would
be
the
natural
conclusion
if
you
refused
to
give
an
explanation
do
you
see
that
the
papers
would
make
a
sensation
of
the
matter
there
is
no
telling
what
they
would
say
about
you
the
world
would
jump
at
the
scandal
bait
and
you
would
be
the
most
notorious
of
women
to
be
perfectly
plain
with
you
if
you
refuse
to
expose
the
people
who
abducted
you
there
could
be
but
one
inference
it
would
simply
mean
that
you
were
a
party
to
the
plot
and
fled
to
evade
the
wedding
at
gudule
upon
whom
would
suspicion
fall
upon
the
man
who
was
supposed
to
have
sailed
for
new
york
and
upon
his
friends
where
have
you
been
during
the
last
few
weeks
if
you
did
not
answer
the
world
would
grin
and
say
new
york
and
of
her
own
volition
do
you
see
dorothy
there
is
but
one
way
to
end
this
horrible
mistake
of
mine
only
one
way
to
protect
you
from
humiliation
even
degradation
you
mean
by
she
began
faintly
afraid
to
complete
the
dreaded
surmise
by
the
surrender
of
the
real
criminal
he
said
calmly
i
will
not
agree
to
that
she
cried
imperatively
if
you
give
yourself
up
to
them
philip
quentin
i
will
deny
every
word
of
your
confession
she
went
on
triumphantly
i
afraid
they
would
doubt
you
he
responded
but
his
heart
leaped
gladly
and
do
you
know
what
else
i
shall
do
if
you
persist
i
tell
the
world
that
you
were
not
alone
in
this
affair
and
i
send
the
officers
to
castle
craneycrow
to
arrest
every
she
was
crying
hysterically
when
he
interrupted
but
you
have
promised
to
shield
them
promised
i
will
forget
that
i
ever
made
a
promise
philip
quentin
either
i
go
to
brussels
alone
or
every
person
in
craneycrow
goes
to
prison
with
you
i
not
spare
one
of
them
promise
what
do
i
care
for
that
promise
do
as
you
like
phil
but
i
mean
every
word
of
it
you
would
dare
dorothy
you
would
dare
he
cried
imploringly
they
are
not
to
blame
i
am
the
guilty
one
they
are
not
one
way
or
the
other
phil
she
cried
firmly
it
is
safety
for
all
or
disgrace
for
all
now
will
you
go
to
brussels
but
my
heavens
how
can
you
explain
to
the
world
he
cried
in
deepest
distress
i
have
thought
of
all
that
providence
gave
me
the
solution
she
said
her
face
beaming
with
the
joy
of
victory
not
even
providence
can
supply
an
explanation
he
groaned
you
forget
courant
the
dead
man
he
can
not
deny
the
charge
if
i
conclude
to
accuse
him
of
the
crime
he
is
the
solution
xxx
love
is
blind
but
ugo
can
disprove
it
he
said
after
a
moment
thought
only
by
confessing
his
own
duplicity
she
said
tranquilly
you
will
not
marry
him
dorothy
she
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
and
no
word
could
have
answered
plainer
than
the
disdain
which
swept
across
her
lovely
face
what
do
you
think
of
me
phil
she
asked
in
hurt
tones
and
he
answered
with
his
eyes
because
he
could
not
trust
his
voice
the
longing
to
throw
her
arms
about
the
man
whose
burning
eyes
had
set
her
heart
afire
was
almost
uncontrollable
the
hope
that
he
would
throw
off
restraint
and
cry
out
his
love
drove
her
timidly
into
silent
expectancy
his
whole
soul
surged
to
his
lips
and
eyes
but
he
fought
back
the
words
that
would
have
made
them
both
so
happy
he
knew
she
loved
him
the
faintest
whisper
from
him
would
cause
her
lips
to
breathe
the
passion
her
eyes
revealed
and
yet
he
was
strong
enough
to
bide
his
time
how
long
this
exquisite
communion
of
thoughts
lasted
neither
knew
nor
cared
through
the
leafy
wood
they
drove
in
utter
silence
both
understanding
both
revealing
both
waiting
he
dared
not
look
at
the
glorious
face
he
dared
not
speak
to
her
he
dared
not
tempt
the
heart
that
might
betray
his
head
it
was
he
who
at
last
broke
that
joyous
calm
and
his
voice
was
husky
with
suppressed
emotion
you
will
not
forget
that
some
day
i
am
coming
to
you
as
phil
quentin
and
not
in
the
mask
of
a
i
shall
expect
you
robber
to
appear
before
a
certain
tribunal
and
there
explain
if
you
can
what
led
you
to
commit
the
crime
that
has
shocked
the
world
she
said
brightly
i
implore
the
leniency
of
the
high
court
he
said
tenderly
the
court
can
only
put
you
on
probation
and
exact
the
promise
that
you
will
never
steal
another
and
the
length
of
probation
for
all
your
natural
life
demurely
then
i
must
appeal
to
a
higher
court
he
said
soberly
what
she
cried
do
you
object
to
the
judgment
not
at
all
he
said
earnestly
i
will
merely
appeal
to
the
higher
court
for
permission
to
live
both
laughed
with
the
buoyancy
that
comes
from
suppressed
delight
it
occurs
to
me
dorothy
said
he
a
few
minutes
later
that
we
are
a
long
time
in
reaching
the
town
father
bivot
told
me
about
we
seem
to
be
in
the
wilds
and
he
said
there
were
a
number
of
houses
within
five
miles
of
craneycrow
have
we
passed
a
single
habitation
i
have
not
seen
one
but
i
sorry
the
time
seems
long
she
said
i
wonder
if
we
have
lost
the
way
he
went
on
a
troubled
expression
in
his
eyes
this
certainly
is
a
highway
and
he
said
we
would
come
to
one
within
three
miles
of
the
castle
see
it
is
eleven
and
we
have
been
driving
for
more
than
two
hours
at
a
pretty
fair
gait
by
the
eternal
dorothy
we
may
be
lost
how
delightful
she
cried
her
eyes
sparkling
i
do
believe
you
care
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
i
should
have
said
how
frightful
she
corrected
contritely
this
is
getting
you
on
a
train
by
any
manner
of
means
he
said
could
i
have
misunderstood
the
directions
he
gave
he
was
really
disturbed
and
the
poor
horse
seems
so
tired
too
she
said
serenely
by
jove
did
we
cross
a
stream
an
hour
or
so
ago
he
cried
a
horrid
splashy
little
stream
we
crossed
it
long
well
we
should
have
crossed
it
he
said
ruefully
i
should
have
turned
up
the
hill
over
the
creek
road
we
miles
out
of
the
way
what
shall
we
do
she
asked
with
a
brave
show
of
dismay
i
do
know
we
in
a
deuce
of
a
pickle
do
you
see
he
said
i
ca
say
that
i
do
see
she
said
ca
we
drive
back
to
the
creek
we
could
if
i
could
turn
the
confounded
trap
about
but
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
can
i
turn
on
a
road
that
is
wide
enough
for
two
bicycles
to
pass
in
safety
steep
unclimable
hill
on
our
left
deep
ravine
on
our
and
a
narrow
bit
of
a
road
ahead
of
us
she
said
it
looks
very
much
as
if
the
crooked
and
narrow
path
is
the
best
this
that
narrow
road
seemed
to
have
no
end
and
it
never
widened
the
driving
at
last
became
dangerous
and
they
realized
that
the
tired
horse
was
drawing
them
up
a
long
gradual
slope
the
way
became
steeper
and
the
road
rough
with
rocks
and
ruts
her
composure
was
rapidly
deserting
her
and
he
was
the
picture
of
impatience
if
we
should
meet
anyone
else
driving
what
would
happen
she
asked
fearfully
we
wo
meet
anyone
he
answered
nobody
but
a
mountain
goat
would
wittingly
venture
up
this
road
this
poor
old
nag
is
almost
dead
this
is
a
pretty
mess
how
do
you
like
the
way
i
taking
you
to
the
train
is
this
another
abduction
she
asked
sweetly
and
both
laughed
merrily
in
spite
of
their
predicament
his
haggard
face
still
showing
the
effects
of
illness
grew
more
and
more
troubled
and
at
last
he
said
they
would
have
to
get
down
from
the
trap
not
only
to
avoid
the
danger
of
tipping
over
the
cliff
but
to
relieve
the
horse
in
this
sorry
fashion
they
plodded
along
now
far
above
the
forest
and
in
the
cool
air
of
the
hilltops
there
certainly
must
be
a
top
to
this
accursed
hill
he
panted
he
was
leading
the
horse
by
the
bit
and
she
was
bravely
trudging
at
his
side
there
is
a
bend
in
the
road
up
yonder
phil
she
said
when
they
turned
the
bend
in
the
tortuous
mountain
road
both
drew
up
sharply
with
a
gasp
of
astonishment
for
a
long
time
neither
spoke
their
bewildered
minds
struggling
to
comprehend
the
vast
puzzle
that
confronted
them
even
the
fagged
horse
pricked
up
his
ears
and
looked
ahead
with
interest
not
three
hundred
yards
beyond
the
bend
stood
the
ruins
of
an
enormous
castle
it
is
craneycrow
gasped
the
man
leaning
dizzily
against
the
shaft
of
the
trap
she
could
only
look
at
him
in
mute
consternation
it
was
craneycrow
beyond
all
doubt
but
what
supernatural
power
had
transferred
it
bodily
from
the
squarrose
hill
on
which
it
had
stood
for
centuries
to
the
spot
it
now
occupied
grim
and
almost
grinning
is
this
a
dream
dorothy
are
we
really
back
again
i
ca
believe
it
she
murmured
we
must
be
deceived
by
a
strange
resem
there
is
bob
himself
good
heavens
this
paralyzes
me
hey
bob
bob
a
few
minutes
later
a
limping
horse
dragged
his
bones
into
the
courtyard
and
two
shame
faced
travelers
stood
before
a
taunting
quartet
enduring
their
laughter
wincing
under
their
jests
blushing
like
children
when
the
shots
went
home
for
hours
they
had
driven
in
a
circle
rounding
the
great
row
of
hills
at
last
coming
to
the
very
gate
from
which
they
had
started
forth
so
confidently
they
were
tired
and
hungry
and
nervous
did
you
telegraph
your
mother
you
were
coming
asked
dickey
savage
we
did
not
even
see
a
telegraph
wire
answered
dorothy
dismally
what
did
you
see
he
asked
maliciously
you
should
not
ask
confusing
questions
richard
reprimanded
lady
jane
with
mock
severity
well
we
try
it
over
again
decided
quentin
doggedly
do
you
expect
me
to
let
you
kill
every
horse
i
own
demanded
lord
bob
they
ca
stand
these
pleasure
trips
every
day
do
you
know
glad
to
oblige
you
my
boy
but
i
must
be
that
evening
father
bivot
came
to
the
castle
just
as
they
were
leaving
the
dinner
table
he
brought
startling
news
not
an
hour
before
while
on
his
way
from
the
nearest
village
he
had
come
upon
a
big
party
of
men
quartered
on
the
premises
of
a
gardener
down
the
valley
it
required
but
little
effort
on
his
part
to
discover
that
they
were
officers
from
the
capital
and
that
they
were
looking
for
the
place
where
courant
body
was
found
the
good
father
also
learned
that
detectives
from
brussels
were
in
the
party
and
that
one
of
the
men
was
a
prince
the
eager
listeners
in
castle
craneycrow
soon
drew
from
the
priest
enough
to
convince
them
that
ugo
was
at
the
head
of
the
expedition
and
that
it
was
a
matter
of
but
a
few
hours
until
he
and
his
men
would
be
knocking
at
the
gates
the
prince
did
not
address
me
said
father
bivot
but
listened
intently
as
i
now
recall
to
everything
i
said
in
response
to
the
luxemburg
officer
questions
that
person
asked
me
if
lord
robert
saxondale
owned
a
place
in
the
valley
and
i
said
that
his
lordship
dwelt
in
castle
craneycrow
the
men
were
very
curious
and
a
tall
italian
whispered
questions
to
the
officer
who
put
them
to
me
roughly
there
was
no
harm
in
telling
them
that
his
lordship
was
here
with
a
party
of
friends
good
lord
gasped
dickey
despairingly
it
is
all
over
said
quentin
his
face
rigid
what
will
they
do
demanded
dorothy
i
do
not
understand
your
agitation
good
friends
said
the
priest
in
mild
surprise
have
i
done
wrong
in
telling
them
you
are
here
who
are
they
are
they
enemies
they
are
searching
for
me
father
bivot
said
dorothy
resignedly
for
you
my
child
in
wonder
they
want
to
take
me
back
to
brussels
you
would
not
understand
father
if
i
told
you
the
story
but
i
do
not
want
them
to
find
me
a
frightened
servant
threw
open
the
door
unceremoniously
at
this
juncture
and
controlling
his
excitement
with
moderate
success
announced
that
a
crowd
of
men
were
at
the
gates
demanding
admission
my
god
bob
this
will
ruin
you
and
lady
saxondale
groaned
quentin
what
can
we
do
escape
by
the
underground
passage
lord
saxondale
was
the
coolest
one
in
the
party
he
squared
his
shoulders
sniffed
the
air
belligerently
and
said
he
would
take
the
matter
in
his
own
hands
frances
will
you
take
miss
garrison
upstairs
with
you
and
jane
i
suspect
you
would
better
go
too
the
secret
passage
is
not
to
be
considered
if
we
attempt
to
leave
the
place
after
the
information
father
bivot
has
given
them
it
will
be
a
clean
admission
of
guilt
we
will
face
them
down
they
ca
search
the
castle
without
my
permission
and
they
ca
trespass
here
a
minute
longer
than
i
desire
do
you
care
to
see
the
prince
quentin
see
him
it
is
my
duty
and
not
yours
to
meet
him
it
means
nothing
to
me
and
it
means
disgrace
to
you
bob
let
me
talk
to
if
you
intend
to
act
like
an
ass
phil
you
sha
talk
to
him
i
am
in
control
here
and
i
alone
can
treat
with
him
and
the
please
sir
they
are
becoming
very
angry
and
say
they
will
break
down
the
gates
in
the
name
of
the
law
said
the
servant
reentering
hurriedly
i
will
go
out
and
talk
to
them
about
the
law
said
saxondale
grimly
do
be
alarmed
miss
garrison
we
take
care
of
you
gad
you
look
as
if
you
want
to
faint
get
her
upstairs
i
must
speak
with
you
lord
saxondale
cried
dorothy
clutching
his
arm
and
drawing
him
apart
from
the
group
eagerly
she
whispered
in
his
ear
stamping
her
foot
in
reply
to
his
blank
objections
in
the
end
she
grasped
both
his
shoulders
and
looked
up
into
his
astonished
eyes
determinedly
holding
him
firmly
until
he
nodded
his
head
gravely
then
she
ran
across
the
room
to
the
two
ladies
and
the
bewildered
priest
crying
to
the
latter
you
must
come
upstairs
and
out
of
danger
father
we
have
no
time
to
lose
good
luck
to
you
lord
saxondale
and
she
turned
an
excited
face
to
the
three
men
who
stood
near
the
door
he
shall
not
have
you
dorothy
cried
quentin
he
must
kill
me
trust
to
lord
saxondale
diplomacy
phil
she
said
softly
as
she
passed
him
on
her
way
to
the
stairs
xxxi
her
way
the
grim
smile
that
settled
on
the
faces
of
the
three
men
after
the
women
and
the
trembling
priest
had
passed
from
the
hall
was
not
one
of
amusement
it
was
the
offspring
of
a
desperate
uneasy
courage
quentin
the
safety
of
those
women
upstairs
depends
on
your
thoughtfulness
you
must
leave
this
affair
to
me
we
ca
keep
them
waiting
any
longer
gad
they
will
tear
down
the
historic
gate
i
had
so
much
difficulty
in
building
last
year
wait
for
me
here
i
go
to
meet
the
turk
was
standing
in
the
courtyard
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
lord
bob
commanded
him
to
put
away
the
weapon
and
to
stow
his
mere
chance
caused
turk
to
obey
the
command
in
full
half
of
it
he
did
not
understand
the
voices
outside
the
gate
were
much
more
subdued
than
his
lordship
expected
but
he
did
not
know
that
prince
ugo
had
warily
enjoined
silence
fearing
the
flight
of
the
prey
who
is
there
called
lord
bob
from
the
inside
are
you
lord
saxondale
demanded
a
guttural
voice
on
the
outside
i
am
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
disturbance
we
are
officers
of
the
government
and
we
are
looking
for
a
person
who
is
within
your
walls
open
the
gate
my
how
am
i
to
know
you
are
officers
of
the
law
you
may
be
a
pack
of
bandits
come
back
my
good
i
shall
be
compelled
to
break
down
your
gate
sir
came
from
without
gruffly
do
do
it
the
first
man
who
forces
his
way
will
get
a
bullet
in
his
head
if
you
can
give
me
some
assurance
that
you
are
officers
and
not
thieves
i
may
admit
lord
bob
was
grinning
broadly
much
to
the
amazement
of
the
servant
who
held
the
lantern
there
were
whispers
on
the
outside
prince
ravorelli
is
with
us
my
lord
is
he
sufficient
guarantee
asked
the
hoarse
voice
is
giovanni
pavesi
there
also
asked
saxondale
loudly
i
do
not
know
him
my
lord
the
prince
companions
are
strangers
to
me
is
such
a
person
here
lord
bob
could
almost
see
the
look
on
ugo
face
when
the
question
was
put
to
him
i
never
heard
the
name
came
the
clear
voice
of
the
italian
my
friends
are
well
known
to
lord
saxondale
he
remembers
count
sallaconi
and
the
duke
of
laselli
two
men
from
brussels
are
also
here
captains
devereaux
and
i
recognize
the
prince
voice
said
saxondale
unlocking
the
gate
come
inside
gentlemen
he
said
as
he
stood
before
the
group
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
you
know
but
it
is
wise
to
be
on
the
safe
side
so
you
are
looking
for
some
one
who
is
in
my
castle
may
i
inquire
the
name
of
that
person
you
know
very
well
lord
saxondale
said
ugo
now
taking
the
lead
he
stood
boldly
defiantly
before
the
englishman
carmenita
malban
is
dead
your
excellency
said
bob
coolly
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
sir
grated
the
prince
dorothy
garrison
is
here
held
against
her
will
and
i
her
affianced
husband
command
you
to
surrender
have
you
the
authority
to
take
her
if
i
refuse
to
obey
asked
the
other
with
exasperating
coolness
these
officers
have
the
authority
to
arrest
you
and
to
take
her
from
your
hands
violently
if
oh
well
that
makes
a
difference
of
course
miss
garrison
is
here
prince
ravorelli
but
i
doubt
your
authority
to
take
her
there
is
a
reward
for
her
dead
or
alive
said
count
sallaconi
savagely
and
for
the
abductors
added
the
burly
man
from
luxemburg
i
shall
have
to
place
you
under
arrest
my
one
moment
my
good
man
miss
garrison
is
her
own
mistress
i
believe
addressing
the
prince
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
sure
i
do
know
but
it
may
be
important
if
you
will
kindly
request
your
followers
to
remain
in
the
courtyard
you
may
enter
the
castle
and
converse
with
miss
garrison
herself
prince
paves
i
should
say
there
was
a
wild
hunted
look
in
the
italian
eyes
and
there
was
murder
in
his
heart
i
will
ask
you
and
the
count
and
the
duke
and
officer
luxemburg
to
come
with
with
rare
dignity
lord
saxondale
strode
across
the
flags
and
deliberately
threw
open
the
huge
castle
door
after
a
moment
of
indecision
and
not
a
little
trepidation
prince
ugo
followed
with
his
two
countrymen
not
far
behind
the
luxemburg
officer
gave
hurried
instructions
to
his
men
and
took
his
place
among
the
favored
few
it
was
a
hiss
ending
in
a
triumphant
ah
that
came
from
the
lips
of
ugo
when
he
was
face
to
face
with
philip
quentin
his
glittering
eyes
plainly
said
that
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
the
discovery
of
the
fact
a
week
before
that
the
two
americans
had
not
sailed
for
new
york
provided
the
foundation
for
a
shrewd
guess
and
he
had
not
been
wrong
it
is
as
i
suspected
he
said
tersely
i
trust
i
am
not
too
late
to
save
miss
garrison
from
one
moment
please
commanded
lord
bob
you
are
here
through
sufferance
and
you
must
for
the
time
being
imagine
yourself
a
gentleman
if
you
care
to
talk
over
the
situation
with
us
while
we
wait
for
lady
saxondale
and
miss
garrison
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
have
you
do
so
will
you
be
seated
gentlemen
we
are
not
here
to
be
directed
by
you
lord
saxondale
we
have
tracked
this
scoundrel
to
earth
and
we
are
ugo
was
saying
hotly
when
his
lordship
turned
on
him
sternly
mr
quentin
is
my
guest
another
remark
of
that
character
and
i
will
throw
you
bodily
from
the
room
this
is
my
house
prince
paying
no
heed
to
the
malevolent
glare
in
the
eyes
saxondale
turned
and
bade
a
servant
ask
miss
garrison
to
come
down
if
it
pleased
her
to
do
so
i
presume
brussels
is
very
much
excited
over
miss
disappearance
said
he
to
the
prince
brussels
is
horrified
but
she
will
rejoice
tomorrow
thank
god
we
have
not
toiled
in
sit
down
may
i
inquire
for
the
health
of
garrison
the
four
newcomers
more
or
less
ill
at
ease
sat
down
with
lord
bob
the
two
americans
standing
quentin
leaned
against
the
big
post
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
his
face
the
picture
of
gloomy
defiance
i
am
not
her
physician
she
is
quite
well
then
i
may
reasonably
infer
can
you
tell
me
whether
she
is
in
brussels
she
will
be
in
luxemburg
in
the
morning
if
my
message
reaches
her
but
we
are
not
here
for
the
purpose
of
bandying
words
with
you
sir
this
house
must
be
searched
whether
you
like
it
or
not
captain
call
in
your
men
cried
the
prince
his
rage
getting
the
better
of
him
you
will
find
that
the
door
is
barred
captain
said
saxondale
easily
the
expression
that
came
into
the
faces
of
the
four
men
was
one
not
soon
to
be
forgotten
for
a
full
minute
there
was
absolute
silence
do
you
mean
that
we
are
prisoners
demanded
ugo
his
teeth
showing
but
not
in
a
smile
not
at
all
the
door
has
a
habit
of
locking
i
command
you
to
open
that
door
cried
the
prince
looking
about
him
like
a
trapped
rat
he
snarled
with
rage
when
he
saw
the
smile
on
quentin
face
dickey
sudden
chuckle
threw
dismay
into
the
ranks
of
the
confident
besiegers
do
not
be
alarmed
gentlemen
said
saxondale
the
door
shall
be
opened
in
good
time
ah
i
think
the
ladies
are
as
he
spoke
dorothy
and
lady
saxondale
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
ugo
would
have
dashed
up
to
meet
them
had
not
the
two
americans
blocked
the
way
slowly
dorothy
came
down
the
oaken
steps
followed
by
lady
saxondale
lady
jane
and
father
bivot
were
not
far
behind
them
dorothy
cried
ugo
thank
heaven
i
have
found
you
she
stopped
on
the
bottom
step
within
arm
length
of
philip
quentin
there
was
a
moment
of
indecision
a
vivid
flush
leaped
into
her
lovely
cheek
and
then
her
hand
went
quickly
forth
and
rested
on
quentin
shoulder
he
started
and
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
i
am
sorry
ugo
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
you
she
said
steadily
but
her
hand
trembled
convulsively
on
phil
shoulder
mechanically
he
reached
up
and
took
the
slim
fingers
in
his
broad
strong
hand
and
rose
to
the
step
beside
her
the
wrong
murmured
the
prince
mechanically
in
running
away
from
you
as
i
did
she
said
hurriedly
as
if
doubting
her
power
to
proceed
it
was
heartless
of
me
and
it
subjected
you
to
the
crudest
pain
and
humiliation
i
can
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
you
should
despise
despise
you
he
gasped
slowly
the
truth
began
to
dawn
on
two
men
at
the
same
time
ugo
heart
sank
like
a
stone
and
quentin
leaped
as
if
stung
by
an
electric
shock
his
figure
straightened
his
chin
was
lifted
and
the
blood
surged
from
all
parts
of
his
body
to
his
turbulent
heart
i
loved
him
prince
ravorelli
better
than
all
the
world
it
was
a
shameless
way
to
leave
you
but
it
was
the
only
way
she
said
her
voice
full
then
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
quentin
and
for
the
moment
all
else
was
forgotten
my
god
you
you
did
not
leave
brussels
of
your
own
free
will
cried
the
prince
his
eyes
blazing
sallaconi
and
laselli
moved
toward
the
door
and
the
police
officer
face
was
a
study
i
ran
away
with
the
man
i
love
she
answered
bravely
it
is
a
lie
shrieked
the
italian
saxondale
seized
his
hand
in
time
to
prevent
the
drawing
of
a
revolver
from
his
coat
pocket
you
this
is
a
trick
you
have
miss
garrison
word
for
it
your
excellency
she
was
not
abducted
and
your
search
has
been
for
naught
said
the
big
englishman
there
are
no
abductors
here
the
famous
abduction
was
a
part
of
the
game
and
it
was
abetted
by
the
supposed
but
there
is
a
reward
for
her
return
to
brussels
interrupted
the
luxemburg
official
speaking
for
the
first
time
i
must
insist
that
she
come
with
the
reward
is
for
dorothy
garrison
is
it
not
demanded
saxondale
yes
my
well
as
you
can
not
get
out
of
the
castle
and
your
friends
can
not
get
into
it
until
we
open
the
doors
there
is
absolutely
no
possibility
of
your
taking
dorothy
garrison
to
do
you
mean
to
oppose
the
law
cried
ugo
panting
with
rage
gentlemen
as
the
host
in
castle
craneycrow
i
invite
you
to
witness
the
marriage
ceremony
which
is
to
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
take
dorothy
garrison
to
brussels
you
have
come
gentlemen
a
trifle
noisily
and
unkindly
i
admit
just
in
time
to
witness
the
wedding
of
my
two
very
good
friends
who
eloped
with
the
sound
of
wedding
bells
in
their
ears
father
bivot
the
bride
and
groom
await
dorothy
my
darling
whispered
quentin
she
turned
her
burning
face
away
it
is
my
way
phil
i
love
you
she
murmured
the
end
