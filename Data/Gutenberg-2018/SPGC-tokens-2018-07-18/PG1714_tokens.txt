another

and
clara
bell
dedication
to
leon
gozlan
as
a
token
of
literary
another
study
of
woman
at
paris
there
are
almost
always
two
separate
parties
going
on
at
every
ball
and
rout
first
an
official
party
composed
of
the
persons
invited
a
fashionable
and
circle
each
one
grimaces
for
his
neighbor
s
eye
most
of
the
younger
women
are
there
for
one
person
only
when
each
woman
has
assured
herself
that
for
that
one
she
is
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
room
and
that
the
opinion
is
perhaps
shared
by
a
few
others
a
few
insignificant
phrases
are
exchanged
as
do
you
think
of
going
away
soon
to
la
crampade
how
well
madame
de
portenduère
sang
who
is
that
little
woman
with
such
a
load
of
diamonds
or
after
firing
off
some
smart
epigrams
which
give
transient
pleasure
and
leave
wounds
that
rankle
long
the
groups
thin
out
the
mere
lookers
on
go
away
and
the
waxlights
burn
down
to
the
sconces
the
mistress
of
the
house
then
waylays
a
few
artists
amusing
people
or
intimate
friends
saying
do
not
go
yet
we
will
have
a
snug
little
these
collect
in
some
small
room
the
second
the
real
party
now
begins
a
party
where
as
of
old
every
one
can
hear
what
is
said
conversation
is
general
each
one
is
bound
to
be
witty
and
to
contribute
to
the
amusement
of
all
everything
is
made
to
tell
honest
laughter
takes
the
place
of
the
gloom
which
in
company
saddens
the
prettiest
faces
in
short
where
the
rout
ends
pleasure
begins
the
rout
a
cold
display
of
luxury
a
review
of
in
full
dress
is
one
of
those
english
inventions
which
tend
to
mechanize
other
nations
england
seems
bent
on
seeing
the
whole
world
as
dull
as
itself
and
dull
in
the
same
way
so
this
second
party
is
in
some
french
houses
a
happy
protest
on
the
part
of
the
old
spirit
of
our
people
only
unfortunately
so
few
houses
protest
and
the
reason
is
a
simple
one
if
we
no
longer
have
many
suppers
nowadays
it
is
because
never
under
any
rule
have
there
been
fewer
men
placed
established
and
successful
than
under
the
reign
of
louis
philippe
when
the
revolution
began
again
lawfully
everybody
is
on
the
march
some
whither
or
trotting
at
the
heels
of
fortune
time
has
become
the
costliest
commodity
so
no
one
can
afford
the
lavish
extravagance
of
going
home
morning
and
getting
up
late
hence
there
is
no
second
soiree
now
but
at
the
houses
of
women
rich
enough
to
entertain
and
since
july
such
women
may
be
counted
in
paris
in
spite
of
the
covert
opposition
of
the
faubourg
two
or
three
women
among
them
madame
d
espard
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
have
not
chosen
to
give
up
the
share
of
influence
they
exercised
in
paris
and
have
not
closed
their
houses
the
salon
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
is
noted
in
paris
as
being
the
last
refuge
where
the
old
french
wit
has
found
a
home
with
its
reserved
depths
its
myriad
subtle
byways
and
its
exquisite
politeness
you
will
there
still
find
grace
of
manner
notwithstanding
the
conventionalities
of
courtesy
perfect
freedom
of
talk
notwithstanding
the
reserve
which
is
natural
to
persons
of
breeding
and
above
all
a
liberal
flow
of
ideas
no
one
there
thinks
of
keeping
his
thought
for
a
play
and
no
one
regards
a
story
as
material
for
a
book
in
short
the
hideous
skeleton
of
literature
at
bay
never
stalks
there
on
the
prowl
for
a
clever
sally
or
an
interesting
subject
the
memory
of
one
of
these
evenings
especially
dwells
with
me
less
by
reason
of
a
confidence
in
which
the
illustrious
de
marsay
opened
up
one
of
the
deepest
recesses
of
woman
s
heart
than
on
account
of
the
reflections
to
which
his
narrative
gave
rise
as
to
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
the
french
woman
since
the
fateful
revolution
of
july
on
that
evening
chance
had
brought
together
several
persons
whose
indisputable
merits
have
won
them
european
reputations
this
is
not
a
piece
of
flattery
addressed
to
france
for
there
were
a
good
many
foreigners
present
and
indeed
the
men
who
most
shone
were
not
the
most
famous
ingenious
repartee
acute
remarks
admirable
banter
pictures
sketched
with
brilliant
precision
all
sparkled
and
flowed
without
elaboration
were
poured
out
without
disdain
but
without
effort
and
were
exquisitely
expressed
and
delicately
appreciated
the
men
of
the
world
especially
were
conspicuous
for
their
really
artistic
grace
and
spirit
elsewhere
in
europe
you
will
find
elegant
manners
cordiality
genial
fellowship
and
knowledge
but
only
in
paris
in
this
and
those
to
which
i
have
alluded
does
the
particular
wit
abound
which
gives
an
agreeable
and
changeful
unity
to
all
these
social
qualities
an
indescribable
flow
which
makes
this
profusion
of
ideas
of
definitions
of
anecdotes
of
historical
incidents
meander
with
ease
paris
the
capital
of
taste
alone
possesses
the
science
which
makes
conversation
a
tourney
in
which
each
type
of
wit
is
condensed
into
a
shaft
each
speaker
utters
his
phrase
and
casts
his
experience
in
a
word
in
which
every
one
finds
amusement
relaxation
and
exercise
here
then
alone
will
you
exchange
ideas
here
you
need
not
like
the
dolphin
in
the
fable
carry
a
monkey
on
your
shoulders
here
you
will
be
understood
and
will
not
risk
staking
your
gold
pieces
against
base
metal
here
again
secrets
neatly
betrayed
and
talk
light
or
deep
play
and
eddy
changing
their
aspect
and
hue
at
every
phrase
eager
criticism
and
crisp
anecdotes
lead
on
from
one
to
the
next
all
eyes
are
listening
a
gesture
asks
a
question
and
an
expressive
look
gives
the
answer
in
short
and
in
a
word
everything
is
wit
and
mind
the
phenomenon
of
speech
which
when
duly
studied
and
well
handled
is
the
power
of
the
actor
and
the
had
never
so
completely
bewitched
me
nor
was
i
alone
under
the
influence
of
its
spell
we
all
spent
a
delightful
evening
the
conversation
had
drifted
into
anecdote
and
brought
out
in
its
rushing
course
some
curious
confessions
several
portraits
and
a
thousand
follies
which
make
this
enchanting
improvisation
impossible
to
record
still
by
setting
these
things
down
in
all
their
natural
freshness
and
abruptness
their
elusive
divarications
you
may
perhaps
feel
the
charm
of
a
real
french
evening
taken
at
the
moment
when
the
most
engaging
familiarity
makes
each
one
forget
his
own
interests
his
personal
conceit
or
if
you
like
his
pretensions
at
about
two
in
the
morning
as
supper
ended
no
one
was
left
sitting
round
the
table
but
intimate
friends
proved
by
intercourse
of
fifteen
years
and
some
persons
of
great
taste
and
good
breeding
who
knew
the
world
by
tacit
agreement
perfectly
carried
out
at
supper
every
one
renounced
his
pretensions
to
importance
perfect
equality
set
the
tone
but
indeed
there
was
no
one
present
who
was
not
very
proud
of
being
himself
mademoiselle
des
touches
always
insists
on
her
guests
remaining
at
table
till
they
leave
having
frequently
remarked
the
change
which
a
move
produces
in
the
spirit
of
a
party
between
the
and
the
the
charm
is
destroyed
according
to
sterne
the
ideas
of
an
author
after
shaving
are
different
from
those
he
had
before
if
sterne
is
right
may
it
not
be
boldly
asserted
that
the
frame
of
mind
of
a
party
at
table
is
not
the
same
as
that
of
the
same
persons
returned
to
the
the
atmosphere
is
not
heady
the
eye
no
longer
contemplates
the
brilliant
disorder
of
the
dessert
lost
are
the
happy
effects
of
that
laxness
of
mood
that
benevolence
which
comes
over
us
while
we
remain
in
the
humor
peculiar
to
the
man
settled
comfortably
on
one
of
the
springy
chairs
which
are
made
in
these
days
perhaps
we
are
not
more
ready
to
talk
face
to
face
with
the
dessert
and
in
the
society
of
good
wine
during
the
delightful
interval
when
every
one
may
sit
with
an
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
not
only
does
every
one
like
to
talk
then
but
also
to
listen
digestion
which
is
almost
always
attent
is
loquacious
or
silent
as
characters
differ
then
every
one
finds
his
opportunity
was
not
this
preamble
necessary
to
make
you
know
the
charm
of
the
narrative
by
which
a
celebrated
man
now
dead
depicted
the
innocent
jesuistry
of
women
painting
it
with
the
subtlety
peculiar
to
persons
who
have
seen
much
of
the
world
and
which
makes
statesmen
such
delightful
storytellers
when
like
prince
talleyrand
and
prince
metternich
they
vouchsafe
to
tell
a
story
de
marsay
prime
minister
for
some
six
months
had
already
given
proofs
of
superior
capabilities
those
who
had
known
him
long
were
not
indeed
surprised
to
see
him
display
all
the
talents
and
various
aptitudes
of
a
statesman
still
it
might
yet
be
a
question
whether
he
would
prove
to
be
a
solid
politician
or
had
merely
been
moulded
in
the
fire
of
circumstance
this
question
had
just
been
asked
by
a
man
whom
he
had
made
a
préfet
a
man
of
wit
and
observation
who
had
for
a
long
time
been
a
journalist
and
who
admired
de
marsay
without
infusing
into
his
admiration
that
dash
of
acrid
criticism
by
which
in
paris
one
superior
man
excuses
himself
from
admiring
another
was
there
ever
said
he
in
your
former
life
any
event
any
thought
or
wish
which
told
you
what
your
vocation
was
asked
émile
blondet
for
we
all
like
newton
have
our
apple
which
falls
and
leads
us
to
the
spot
where
our
faculties
yes
said
de
marsay
i
will
tell
you
about
pretty
women
political
dandies
artists
old
men
de
marsay
s
intimate
friends
settled
themselves
comfortably
each
in
his
favorite
attitude
to
look
at
the
minister
need
it
be
said
that
the
servants
had
left
that
the
doors
were
shut
and
the
curtains
drawn
over
them
the
silence
was
so
complete
that
the
murmurs
of
the
coachmen
s
voices
could
be
heard
from
the
courtyard
and
the
pawing
and
champing
made
by
horses
when
asking
to
be
taken
back
to
their
stable
the
statesman
my
friends
exists
by
one
single
quality
said
the
minister
playing
with
his
gold
and
dessert
knife
to
wit
the
power
of
always
being
master
of
himself
of
profiting
more
or
less
under
all
circumstances
by
every
event
however
fortuitous
in
short
of
having
within
himself
a
cold
and
disinterested
other
self
who
looks
on
as
a
spectator
at
all
the
changes
of
life
noting
our
passions
and
our
sentiments
and
whispering
to
us
in
every
case
the
judgment
of
a
sort
of
moral
that
explains
why
a
statesman
is
so
rare
a
thing
in
france
said
old
lord
dudley
from
a
sentimental
point
of
view
this
is
horrible
the
minister
went
on
hence
when
such
a
phenomenon
is
seen
in
a
young
who
when
warned
overnight
by
a
letter
of
concini
s
peril
slept
till
midday
when
his
benefactor
was
killed
at
ten
o
say
pitt
or
napoleon
he
was
a
monster
i
became
such
a
monster
at
a
very
early
age
thanks
to
a
i
fancied
said
madame
de
montcornet
with
a
smile
that
more
politicians
were
undone
by
us
than
we
could
the
monster
of
which
i
speak
is
a
monster
just
because
he
withstands
you
replied
de
marsay
with
a
little
ironical
bow
if
this
is
a
the
baronne
de
nucingen
interposed
i
request
that
it
may
not
be
interrupted
by
any
reflection
is
so
antipathetic
to
it
cried
joseph
bridau
i
was
seventeen
de
marsay
went
on
the
restoration
was
being
consolidated
my
old
friends
know
how
impetuous
and
fervid
i
was
then
i
was
in
love
for
the
first
time
and
i
may
say
so
of
the
handsomest
young
fellows
in
paris
i
had
youth
and
good
looks
two
advantages
due
to
good
fortune
but
of
which
we
are
all
as
proud
as
of
a
conquest
i
must
be
silent
as
to
the
all
youths
i
was
in
love
with
a
woman
six
years
older
than
myself
no
one
of
you
here
said
he
looking
carefully
round
the
table
can
suspect
her
name
or
recognize
her
ronquerolles
alone
at
the
time
ever
guessed
my
secret
he
had
kept
it
well
but
i
should
have
feared
his
smile
however
he
is
gone
said
the
minister
looking
round
he
would
not
stay
to
supper
said
madame
de
nucingen
for
six
months
possessed
by
my
passion
de
marsay
went
on
but
incapable
of
suspecting
that
it
had
overmastered
me
i
had
abandoned
myself
to
that
rapturous
idolatry
which
is
at
once
the
triumph
and
the
frail
joy
of
the
young
i
treasured
her
old
gloves
i
drank
an
infusion
of
the
flowers
she
had
worn
i
got
out
of
bed
at
night
to
go
and
gaze
at
her
window
all
my
blood
rushed
to
my
heart
when
i
inhaled
the
perfume
she
used
i
was
miles
away
from
knowing
that
woman
is
a
stove
with
a
marble
oh
spare
us
your
terrible
verdicts
cried
madame
de
montcornet
with
a
smile
i
believe
i
should
have
crushed
with
my
scorn
the
philosopher
who
first
uttered
this
terrible
but
profoundly
true
thought
said
de
marsay
you
are
all
far
too
for
me
to
say
any
more
on
that
point
these
few
words
will
remind
you
of
your
own
follies
a
great
lady
if
ever
there
was
one
a
widow
without
all
was
idol
would
shut
herself
up
to
mark
my
linen
with
her
hair
in
short
she
responded
to
my
madness
by
her
own
and
how
can
we
fail
to
believe
in
passion
when
it
has
the
guarantee
of
madness
we
each
devoted
all
our
minds
to
concealing
a
love
so
perfect
and
so
beautiful
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
we
succeeded
and
what
charm
we
found
in
our
escapades
of
her
i
will
say
nothing
she
was
perfection
then
and
to
this
day
is
considered
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
in
paris
but
at
that
time
a
man
would
have
endured
death
to
win
one
of
her
glances
she
had
been
left
with
an
amount
of
fortune
sufficient
for
a
woman
who
had
loved
and
was
adored
but
the
restoration
to
which
she
owed
renewed
lustre
made
it
seem
inadequate
in
comparison
with
her
name
in
my
position
i
was
so
fatuous
as
never
to
dream
of
a
suspicion
though
my
jealousy
would
have
been
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
that
terrible
passion
slumbered
in
me
as
gold
in
the
nugget
i
would
have
ordered
my
servant
to
thrash
me
if
i
had
been
so
base
as
ever
to
doubt
the
purity
of
that
fragile
and
so
strong
so
fair
so
artless
pure
spotless
and
whose
blue
eyes
allowed
my
gaze
to
sound
it
to
the
very
depths
of
her
heart
with
adorable
submissiveness
never
was
there
the
slightest
hesitancy
in
her
attitude
her
look
or
word
always
white
and
fresh
and
ready
for
the
beloved
like
the
oriental
lily
of
the
song
of
songs
ah
my
friends
sadly
exclaimed
the
minister
grown
young
again
a
man
must
hit
his
head
very
hard
on
the
marble
to
dispel
that
poem
this
cry
of
nature
finding
an
echo
in
the
listeners
spurred
the
curiosity
he
had
excited
in
them
with
so
much
skill
every
morning
riding
fine
horse
you
sent
me
from
england
de
marsay
went
on
addressing
lord
dudley
i
rode
past
her
open
carriage
the
horses
pace
being
intentionally
reduced
to
a
walk
and
read
the
order
of
the
day
signaled
to
me
by
the
flowers
of
her
bouquet
in
case
we
were
unable
to
exchange
a
few
words
though
we
saw
each
other
almost
every
evening
in
society
and
she
wrote
to
me
every
day
to
deceive
the
curious
and
mislead
the
observant
we
had
adopted
a
scheme
of
conduct
never
to
look
at
each
other
to
avoid
meeting
to
speak
ill
of
each
other
swagger
or
playing
the
disdained
swain
these
old
manoeuvres
are
not
to
compare
on
either
part
with
a
false
passion
professed
for
an
indifferent
person
and
an
air
of
indifference
towards
the
true
idol
if
two
lovers
will
only
play
that
game
the
world
will
always
be
deceived
but
then
they
must
be
very
secure
of
each
other
her
was
a
man
in
high
favor
a
courtier
cold
and
sanctimonious
whom
she
never
received
at
her
own
house
this
little
comedy
was
performed
for
the
benefit
of
simpletons
and
circles
who
laughed
at
it
marriage
was
never
spoken
of
between
us
six
years
difference
of
age
might
give
her
pause
she
knew
nothing
of
my
fortune
of
which
on
principle
i
have
always
kept
the
secret
i
on
my
part
fascinated
by
her
wit
and
manners
by
the
extent
of
her
knowledge
and
her
experience
of
the
world
would
have
married
her
without
a
thought
at
the
same
time
her
reserve
charmed
me
if
she
had
been
the
first
to
speak
of
marriage
in
a
certain
tone
i
might
perhaps
have
noted
it
as
vulgar
in
that
accomplished
soul
six
months
full
and
diamond
of
the
purest
water
that
has
been
my
portion
of
love
in
this
base
world
one
morning
attacked
by
the
feverish
stiffness
which
marks
the
beginning
of
a
cold
i
wrote
her
a
line
to
put
off
one
of
those
secret
festivals
which
are
buried
under
the
roofs
of
paris
like
pearls
in
the
sea
no
sooner
was
the
letter
sent
than
remorse
seized
me
she
will
not
believe
that
i
am
ill
thought
i
she
was
wont
to
affect
jealousy
and
jealousy
is
genuine
said
de
marsay
interrupting
himself
it
is
the
visible
sign
of
an
unique
why
asked
the
princesse
de
cadignan
eagerly
unique
and
true
love
said
de
marsay
produces
a
sort
of
corporeal
apathy
attuned
to
the
contemplation
into
which
one
falls
then
the
mind
complicates
everything
it
works
on
itself
pictures
its
fancies
turns
them
into
reality
and
torment
and
such
jealousy
is
as
delightful
as
it
is
a
foreign
minister
smiled
as
by
the
light
of
memory
he
felt
the
truth
of
this
remark
besides
de
marsay
went
on
i
said
to
myself
why
miss
a
happy
hour
was
it
not
better
to
go
even
though
feverish
and
then
if
she
learns
that
i
am
ill
i
believe
her
capable
of
hurrying
here
and
compromising
herself
i
made
an
effort
i
wrote
a
second
letter
and
carried
it
myself
for
my
confidential
servant
was
now
gone
the
river
lay
between
us
i
had
to
cross
paris
but
at
last
within
a
suitable
distance
of
her
house
i
caught
sight
of
a
messenger
i
charged
him
to
have
the
note
sent
up
to
her
at
once
and
i
had
the
happy
idea
of
driving
past
her
door
in
a
hackney
cab
to
see
whether
she
might
not
by
chance
receive
the
two
letters
together
at
the
moment
when
i
arrived
it
was
two
o
clock
the
great
gate
opened
to
admit
a
carriage
whose
of
the
it
is
fifteen
years
even
while
i
tell
the
tale
i
the
exhausted
orator
the
minister
dried
up
by
the
friction
of
public
business
i
still
feel
a
surging
in
my
heart
and
the
hot
blood
about
my
diaphragm
at
the
end
of
an
hour
i
passed
once
more
the
carriage
was
still
in
the
courtyard
my
note
no
doubt
was
in
the
porter
s
hands
at
last
at
three
the
carriage
drove
out
i
could
observe
my
rival
s
expression
he
was
grave
and
did
not
smile
but
he
was
in
love
and
no
doubt
there
was
business
in
hand
i
went
to
keep
my
appointment
the
queen
of
my
heart
met
me
i
saw
her
calm
pure
serene
and
here
i
must
confess
that
i
have
always
thought
that
othello
was
not
only
stupid
but
showed
very
bad
taste
only
a
man
who
is
half
a
negro
could
behave
so
indeed
shakespeare
felt
this
when
he
called
his
play
the
moor
of
the
sight
of
the
woman
we
love
is
such
a
balm
to
the
heart
that
it
must
dispel
anguish
doubt
and
sorrow
all
my
rage
vanished
i
could
smile
again
hence
this
cheerfulness
which
at
my
age
now
would
be
the
most
atrocious
dissimulation
was
the
result
of
my
youth
and
my
love
my
jealousy
once
buried
i
had
the
power
of
observation
my
ailing
condition
was
evident
the
horrible
doubts
that
had
fermented
in
me
increased
it
at
last
i
found
an
opening
for
putting
in
these
words
you
have
had
no
one
with
you
this
morning
making
a
pretext
of
the
uneasiness
i
had
felt
in
the
fear
lest
she
should
have
disposed
of
her
time
after
receiving
my
first
ah
she
exclaimed
only
a
man
could
have
such
ideas
as
if
i
could
think
of
anything
but
your
suffering
till
the
moment
when
i
received
your
second
note
i
could
think
only
of
how
i
could
contrive
to
see
and
you
were
alone
alone
said
she
looking
at
me
with
a
face
of
innocence
so
perfect
that
it
must
have
been
his
distrust
of
such
a
look
as
that
which
made
the
moor
kill
desdemona
as
she
lived
alone
in
the
house
the
word
was
a
fearful
lie
one
single
lie
destroys
the
absolute
confidence
which
to
some
souls
is
the
very
foundation
of
happiness
to
explain
to
you
what
passed
in
me
at
that
moment
it
must
be
assumed
that
we
have
an
internal
self
of
which
the
exterior
i
is
but
the
husk
that
this
self
as
brilliant
as
light
is
as
fragile
as
a
that
beautiful
self
was
in
me
thenceforth
for
ever
shrouded
in
crape
yes
i
felt
a
cold
and
fleshless
hand
cast
over
me
the
of
experience
dooming
me
to
the
eternal
mourning
into
which
the
first
betrayal
plunges
the
soul
as
i
cast
my
eyes
down
that
she
might
not
observe
my
dizziness
this
proud
thought
somewhat
restored
my
strength
if
she
is
deceiving
you
she
is
unworthy
of
you
i
ascribed
my
sudden
reddening
and
the
tears
which
started
to
my
eyes
to
an
attack
of
pain
and
the
sweet
creature
insisted
on
driving
me
home
with
the
blinds
of
the
cab
drawn
on
the
way
she
was
full
of
a
solicitude
and
tenderness
that
might
have
deceived
the
moor
of
venice
whom
i
have
taken
as
a
standard
of
comparison
indeed
if
that
great
child
were
to
hesitate
two
seconds
longer
every
intelligent
spectator
feels
that
he
would
ask
desdemona
s
forgiveness
thus
killing
the
woman
is
the
act
of
a
wept
as
we
parted
so
much
was
she
distressed
at
being
unable
to
nurse
me
herself
she
wished
she
were
my
valet
in
whose
happiness
she
found
a
cause
of
envy
and
all
this
was
as
elegantly
expressed
oh
as
clarissa
might
have
written
in
her
happiness
there
is
always
a
precious
ape
in
the
prettiest
and
most
angelic
woman
at
these
words
all
the
women
looked
down
as
if
hurt
by
this
brutal
truth
so
brutally
stated
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
night
nor
of
the
week
i
spent
de
marsay
went
on
i
discovered
that
i
was
a
it
was
so
well
said
that
we
all
uttered
an
admiring
exclamation
as
i
thought
over
the
really
cruel
vengeance
to
be
taken
on
a
woman
said
de
marsay
continuing
his
story
with
infernal
as
we
had
loved
each
other
some
terrible
and
irreparable
revenges
were
despised
myself
i
felt
how
common
i
was
i
insensibly
formulated
a
horrible
of
indulgence
in
taking
vengeance
on
a
woman
do
we
not
in
fact
admit
that
there
is
but
one
for
us
that
we
can
not
do
without
her
and
then
is
revenge
the
way
to
win
her
back
if
she
is
not
indispensable
if
there
are
other
women
in
the
world
why
not
grant
her
the
right
to
change
which
we
assume
this
of
course
applies
only
to
passion
in
any
other
sense
it
would
be
socially
wrong
nothing
more
clearly
proves
the
necessity
for
indissoluble
marriage
than
the
instability
of
passion
the
two
sexes
must
be
chained
up
like
wild
beasts
as
they
are
by
inevitable
law
deaf
and
mute
eliminate
revenge
and
infidelity
in
love
is
nothing
those
who
believe
that
for
them
there
is
but
one
woman
in
the
world
must
be
in
favor
of
vengeance
and
then
there
is
but
one
form
of
of
othello
mine
was
the
words
produced
in
each
of
us
the
imperceptible
movement
which
newspaper
writers
represent
in
parliamentary
reports
by
the
words
great
sensation
cured
of
my
cold
and
of
my
pure
absolute
divine
love
i
flung
myself
into
an
adventure
of
which
the
heroine
was
charming
and
of
a
style
of
beauty
utterly
opposed
to
that
of
my
deceiving
angel
i
took
care
not
to
quarrel
with
this
clever
woman
who
was
so
good
an
actress
for
i
doubt
whether
true
love
can
give
such
gracious
delights
as
those
lavished
by
such
a
dexterous
fraud
such
refined
hypocrisy
is
as
good
as
am
not
speaking
to
you
englishwomen
my
lady
said
the
minister
suavely
addressing
lady
barimore
lord
dudley
s
daughter
i
tried
to
be
the
same
lover
i
wished
to
have
some
of
my
hair
worked
up
for
my
new
angel
and
i
went
to
a
skilled
artist
who
at
that
time
dwelt
in
the
rue
boucher
the
man
had
a
monopoly
of
capillary
keepsakes
and
i
mention
his
address
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
not
much
hair
he
has
plenty
of
every
kind
and
every
color
after
i
had
explained
my
order
he
showed
me
his
work
i
then
saw
achievements
of
patience
surpassing
those
which
the
story
books
ascribe
to
fairies
or
which
are
executed
by
prisoners
he
brought
me
up
to
date
as
to
the
caprices
and
fashions
governing
the
use
of
hair
for
the
last
year
said
he
there
has
been
a
rage
for
marking
linen
with
hair
happily
i
had
a
fine
collection
of
hair
and
skilled
needlewomen
hearing
this
a
suspicion
flashed
upon
me
i
took
out
my
handkerchief
and
said
so
this
was
done
in
your
shop
with
false
hair
looked
at
the
handkerchief
and
said
ay
that
lady
was
very
particular
she
insisted
on
verifying
the
tint
of
the
hair
my
wife
herself
marked
those
handkerchiefs
you
have
there
sir
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
work
we
have
ever
before
this
last
ray
of
light
i
might
have
believed
have
taken
a
woman
s
word
i
left
the
shop
still
having
faith
in
pleasure
but
where
love
was
concerned
i
was
as
atheistical
as
a
mathematician
two
months
later
i
was
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
ethereal
being
in
her
boudoir
on
her
sofa
i
was
holding
one
of
her
were
very
we
scaled
the
alps
of
sentiment
culling
their
sweetest
flowers
and
pulling
off
the
there
is
always
a
moment
when
one
pulls
daisies
to
pieces
even
if
it
is
in
a
and
there
are
no
daisies
at
the
intensest
moment
of
tenderness
and
when
we
are
most
in
love
love
is
so
well
aware
of
its
own
short
duration
that
we
are
irresistibly
urged
to
ask
do
you
love
me
will
you
love
me
always
i
seized
the
elegiac
moment
so
warm
so
flowery
so
to
lead
her
to
tell
her
most
delightful
lies
in
the
enchanting
language
of
love
charlotte
displayed
her
choicest
allurements
she
could
not
live
without
me
i
was
to
her
the
only
man
in
the
world
she
feared
to
weary
me
because
my
presence
bereft
her
of
all
her
wits
with
me
all
her
faculties
were
lost
in
love
she
was
indeed
too
tender
to
escape
alarms
for
the
last
six
months
she
had
been
seeking
some
way
to
bind
me
to
her
eternally
and
god
alone
knew
that
secret
in
short
i
was
her
god
the
women
who
heard
de
marsay
seemed
offended
by
seeing
themselves
so
well
acted
for
he
seconded
the
words
by
airs
and
sidelong
attitudes
and
mincing
grimaces
which
were
quite
illusory
at
the
very
moment
when
i
might
have
believed
these
adorable
falsehoods
as
i
still
held
her
right
hand
in
mine
i
said
to
her
when
are
you
to
marry
the
duke
the
thrust
was
so
direct
my
gaze
met
hers
so
boldly
and
her
hand
lay
so
tightly
in
mine
that
her
start
slight
as
it
was
could
not
be
disguised
her
eyes
fell
before
mine
and
a
faint
blush
colored
her
the
duke
what
do
you
mean
she
said
affecting
great
i
know
everything
replied
i
and
in
my
opinion
you
should
delay
no
longer
he
is
rich
he
is
a
duke
but
he
is
more
than
devout
he
is
religious
i
am
sure
therefore
that
you
have
been
faithful
to
me
thanks
to
his
scruples
you
can
not
imagine
how
urgently
necessary
it
is
that
you
should
compromise
him
with
himself
and
with
god
short
of
that
you
will
never
bring
him
to
the
is
this
a
dream
said
she
pushing
her
hair
from
her
forehead
fifteen
years
before
malibran
with
the
gesture
which
malibran
has
made
so
come
do
not
be
childish
my
angel
said
i
trying
to
take
her
hands
but
she
folded
them
before
her
with
a
little
prudish
and
indignant
marry
him
you
have
my
permission
said
i
replying
to
this
gesture
by
using
the
formal
vous
instead
of
tu
nay
better
i
beg
you
to
do
but
cried
she
falling
at
my
knees
there
is
some
horrible
mistake
i
love
no
one
in
the
world
but
you
you
may
demand
any
proofs
you
rise
my
dear
said
i
and
do
me
the
honor
of
being
as
before
do
you
doubt
my
love
nor
my
fidelity
well
i
have
committed
the
greatest
crime
i
went
on
i
have
doubted
your
love
and
your
fidelity
between
two
intoxications
i
looked
calmly
about
calmly
sighed
she
that
is
enough
henri
you
no
longer
love
she
had
at
once
found
you
perceive
a
loophole
for
escape
in
scenes
like
these
an
adverb
is
dangerous
but
happily
curiosity
made
her
add
and
what
did
you
see
have
i
ever
spoken
of
the
duke
excepting
in
public
have
you
detected
in
my
no
said
i
but
in
his
and
you
have
eight
times
made
me
go
to
d
aquin
to
see
you
listening
to
the
same
mass
as
ah
she
exclaimed
then
i
have
made
you
jealous
i
only
wish
i
could
be
said
i
admiring
the
pliancy
of
her
quick
intelligence
and
these
acrobatic
feats
which
can
only
be
successful
in
the
eyes
of
the
blind
but
by
dint
of
going
to
church
i
have
become
very
incredulous
on
the
day
of
my
first
cold
and
your
first
treachery
when
you
thought
i
was
in
bed
you
received
the
duke
and
you
told
me
you
had
seen
no
do
you
know
that
your
conduct
is
infamous
in
what
respect
i
consider
your
marriage
to
the
duke
an
excellent
arrangement
he
gives
you
a
great
name
the
only
rank
that
suits
you
a
brilliant
and
distinguished
position
you
will
be
one
of
the
queens
of
paris
i
should
be
doing
you
a
wrong
if
i
placed
any
obstacle
in
the
way
of
this
prospect
this
distinguished
life
this
splendid
alliance
ah
charlotte
some
day
you
will
do
me
justice
by
discovering
how
unlike
my
character
is
to
that
of
other
young
men
you
would
have
been
compelled
to
deceive
me
yes
you
would
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
break
with
me
for
he
watches
you
it
is
time
that
we
should
part
for
the
duke
is
rigidly
virtuous
you
must
turn
prude
i
advise
you
to
do
so
the
duke
is
vain
he
will
be
proud
of
his
oh
cried
she
bursting
into
tears
henri
if
only
you
had
spoken
yes
if
you
had
chosen
was
i
who
was
to
blame
you
we
would
have
gone
to
live
all
our
days
in
a
corner
married
happy
and
defied
the
well
it
is
too
late
now
said
i
kissing
her
hands
and
putting
on
a
victimized
good
god
but
i
can
undo
it
all
said
no
you
have
gone
too
far
with
the
duke
i
ought
indeed
to
go
a
journey
to
part
us
more
effectually
we
should
both
have
reason
to
fear
our
own
henri
do
you
think
the
duke
has
any
suspicions
i
was
still
henri
but
the
tu
was
lost
for
i
do
not
think
so
i
replied
assuming
the
manner
of
a
friend
but
be
as
devout
as
possible
reconcile
yourself
to
god
for
the
duke
waits
for
proofs
he
hesitates
you
must
bring
him
to
the
she
rose
and
walked
twice
round
the
boudoir
in
real
or
affected
agitation
then
she
no
doubt
found
an
attitude
and
a
look
beseeming
the
new
state
of
affairs
for
she
stopped
in
front
of
me
held
out
her
hand
and
said
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
well
henri
you
are
loyal
noble
and
a
charming
man
i
shall
never
forget
these
were
admirable
tactics
she
was
bewitching
in
this
transition
of
feeling
indispensable
to
the
situation
in
which
she
wished
to
place
herself
in
regard
to
me
i
fell
into
the
attitude
the
manners
and
the
look
of
a
man
so
deeply
distressed
that
i
saw
her
too
newly
assumed
dignity
giving
way
she
looked
at
me
took
my
hand
drew
me
along
almost
threw
me
on
the
sofa
but
quite
gently
and
said
after
a
moment
s
silence
i
am
dreadfully
unhappy
my
dear
fellow
do
you
love
me
oh
well
then
what
will
become
of
you
at
this
point
the
women
all
looked
at
each
other
though
i
can
still
suffer
when
i
recall
her
perfidy
i
still
laugh
at
her
expression
of
entire
conviction
and
sweet
satisfaction
that
i
must
die
or
at
any
rate
sink
into
perpetual
melancholy
de
marsay
went
on
oh
do
not
laugh
yet
he
said
to
his
listeners
there
is
better
to
come
i
looked
at
her
very
tenderly
after
a
pause
and
said
to
her
yes
that
is
what
i
have
been
well
what
will
you
do
i
asked
myself
that
the
day
after
my
she
asked
with
eager
and
i
have
made
advances
to
the
little
lady
to
whom
i
was
supposed
to
be
charlotte
started
up
from
the
sofa
like
a
frightened
doe
trembling
like
a
leaf
gave
me
one
of
those
looks
in
which
women
forgo
all
their
dignity
all
their
modesty
their
refinement
and
even
their
grace
the
sparkling
glitter
of
a
hunted
viper
s
eye
when
driven
into
a
corner
and
said
and
i
have
loved
this
man
i
have
struggled
i
on
this
last
thought
which
i
leave
you
to
guess
she
made
the
most
impressive
pause
i
ever
good
god
she
cried
how
unhappy
are
we
women
we
never
can
be
loved
to
you
there
is
nothing
serious
in
the
purest
feelings
but
never
mind
when
you
cheat
us
you
still
are
our
dupes
i
see
that
plainly
said
i
with
a
stricken
air
you
have
far
too
much
wit
in
your
anger
for
your
heart
to
suffer
from
modest
epigram
increased
her
rage
she
found
some
tears
of
vexation
you
disgust
me
with
the
world
and
with
she
said
you
snatch
away
all
my
illusions
you
deprave
my
she
said
to
me
all
that
i
had
a
right
to
say
to
her
and
with
a
simple
effrontery
an
artless
audacity
which
would
certainly
have
nailed
any
man
but
me
on
the
what
is
to
become
of
us
poor
women
in
a
state
of
society
such
as
louis
s
charter
made
it
imagine
how
her
words
had
run
away
with
her
yes
indeed
we
are
born
to
suffer
in
matters
of
passion
we
are
always
superior
to
you
and
you
are
beneath
all
loyalty
there
is
no
honesty
in
your
hearts
to
you
love
is
a
game
in
which
you
always
my
dear
said
i
to
take
anything
serious
in
society
nowadays
would
be
like
making
romantic
love
to
an
what
a
shameless
betrayal
it
was
deliberately
planned
no
only
a
rational
monsieur
de
marsay
said
she
you
have
deceived
me
surely
i
replied
taking
up
a
submissive
attitude
madame
la
duchesse
will
not
remember
charlotte
s
grievances
certainly
she
answered
then
in
fact
you
hate
me
bowed
and
i
said
to
myself
there
is
something
still
left
the
feeling
she
had
when
i
parted
from
her
allowed
her
to
believe
that
she
still
had
something
to
avenge
well
my
friends
i
have
carefully
studied
the
lives
of
men
who
have
had
great
success
with
women
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
maréchal
de
richelieu
or
lauzun
or
louis
de
valois
ever
effected
a
more
judicious
retreat
at
the
first
attempt
as
to
my
mind
and
heart
they
were
cast
in
a
mould
then
and
there
once
for
all
and
the
power
of
control
i
thus
acquired
over
the
thoughtless
impulses
which
make
us
commit
so
many
follies
gained
me
the
admirable
presence
of
mind
you
all
how
deeply
i
pity
the
second
exclaimed
the
baronne
de
nucingen
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
on
de
marsay
s
pale
lips
made
delphine
de
nucingen
color
how
we
do
forget
said
the
baron
de
nucingen
the
great
banker
s
simplicity
was
so
extremely
droll
that
his
wife
who
was
de
marsay
s
second
could
not
help
laughing
like
every
one
else
you
are
all
ready
to
condemn
the
woman
said
lady
dudley
well
i
quite
understand
that
she
did
not
regard
her
marriage
as
an
act
of
inconstancy
men
will
never
distinguish
between
constancy
and
know
the
woman
whose
story
monsieur
de
marsay
has
told
us
and
she
is
one
of
the
last
of
your
truly
great
alas
my
lady
you
are
right
replied
de
marsay
for
very
nearly
fifty
years
we
have
been
looking
on
at
the
progressive
ruin
of
all
social
distinctions
we
ought
to
have
saved
our
women
from
this
great
wreck
but
the
civil
code
has
swept
its
leveling
influence
over
their
heads
however
terrible
the
words
they
must
be
spoken
duchesses
are
vanishing
and
marquises
too
as
to
the
must
apologize
to
madame
de
nucingen
who
will
become
a
countess
when
her
husband
is
made
a
peer
of
have
never
succeeded
in
getting
people
to
take
them
aristocracy
begins
with
the
viscountess
said
blondet
with
a
smile
countesses
will
survive
said
de
marsay
an
elegant
woman
will
be
more
or
less
of
a
countess
of
the
empire
or
of
yesterday
a
countess
of
the
old
block
or
as
they
say
in
italy
a
countess
by
courtesy
but
as
to
the
great
lady
she
died
out
with
the
dignified
splendor
of
the
last
century
with
powder
patches
slippers
and
stiff
bodices
with
a
delta
stomacher
of
bows
duchesses
in
these
days
can
pass
through
a
door
without
any
need
to
widen
it
for
their
hoops
the
empire
saw
the
last
of
gowns
with
trains
i
am
still
puzzled
to
understand
how
a
sovereign
who
wished
to
see
his
swept
by
ducal
satin
and
velvet
did
not
make
indestructible
laws
napoleon
never
guessed
the
results
of
the
code
he
was
so
proud
of
that
man
by
creating
duchesses
founded
the
race
of
our
ladies
of
indirect
offspring
of
his
it
was
logic
handled
as
a
hammer
by
boys
just
out
of
school
and
by
obscure
journalists
which
demolished
the
splendors
of
the
social
state
said
the
comte
de
vandenesse
in
these
days
every
rogue
who
can
hold
his
head
straight
in
his
collar
cover
his
manly
bosom
with
half
an
ell
of
satin
by
way
of
a
cuirass
display
a
brow
where
apocryphal
genius
gleams
under
curling
locks
and
strut
in
a
pair
of
pumps
graced
by
silk
socks
which
cost
six
francs

into
one
of
his

puckering
up
his
cheek
and
whether
he
be
an
attorney
s
clerk
a
contractor
s
son
or
a
banker
s
bastard
he
stares
impertinently
at
the
prettiest
duchess

her
as
she
walks
downstairs
and
says
to
his
by
buisson
as
we
all
are
and
mounted
in
like
any
duke
there
my
boy
that
is
a
perfect
you
have
not
known
how
to
form
a
party
said
lord
dudley
it
will
be
a
long
time
yet
before
you
have
a
policy
you
talk
a
great
deal
in
france
about
organizing
labor
and
you
have
not
yet
organized
property
so
this
is
what
happens
any
even
in
the
time
of
louis
xviii
and
charles
there
were
some
left
who
had
two
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
a
magnificent
residence
and
a
sumptuous
train
of
such
a
duke
could
live
like
a
great
lord
the
last
of
these
great
gentlemen
in
france
was
the
prince
de
duke
leaves
four
children
two
of
them
girls
granting
that
he
has
great
luck
in
marrying
them
all
well
each
of
these
descendants
will
have
but
sixty
or
eighty
thousand
francs
a
year
now
each
is
the
father
or
mother
of
children
and
consequently
obliged
to
live
with
the
strictest
economy
in
a
flat
on
the
ground
floor
or
first
floor
of
a
large
house
who
knows
if
they
may
not
even
be
hunting
a
fortune
henceforth
the
eldest
son
s
wife
a
duchess
in
name
only
has
no
carriage
no
people
no
no
time
to
herself
she
has
not
her
own
rooms
in
the
family
mansion
nor
her
fortune
nor
her
pretty
toys
she
is
buried
in
trade
she
buys
socks
for
her
dear
little
children
nurses
them
herself
and
keeps
an
eye
on
her
girls
whom
she
no
longer
sends
to
school
at
a
convent
thus
your
noblest
dames
have
been
turned
into
worthy
alas
it
is
true
said
joseph
bridau
in
our
day
we
can
not
show
those
beautiful
flowers
of
womanhood
which
graced
the
golden
ages
of
the
french
monarchy
the
great
lady
s
fan
is
broken
a
woman
has
nothing
now
to
blush
for
she
need
not
slander
or
whisper
hide
her
face
or
reveal
it
a
fan
is
of
no
use
now
but
for
fanning
herself
when
once
a
thing
is
no
more
than
what
it
is
it
is
too
useful
to
be
a
form
of
everything
in
france
has
aided
and
abetted
the
perfect
lady
said
daniel
d
arthez
the
aristocracy
has
acknowledged
her
by
retreating
to
the
recesses
of
its
landed
estates
where
it
has
hidden
itself
to
inland
before
the
march
of
ideas
as
of
old
to
foreign
lands
before
that
of
the
masses
the
women
who
could
have
founded
european
salons
could
have
guided
opinion
and
turned
it
inside
out
like
a
glove
could
have
ruled
the
world
by
ruling
the
men
of
art
or
of
intellect
who
ought
to
have
ruled
it
have
committed
the
blunder
of
abandoning
their
ground
they
were
ashamed
of
having
to
fight
against
the
citizen
class
drunk
with
power
and
rushing
out
on
to
the
stage
of
the
world
there
to
be
cut
to
pieces
perhaps
by
the
barbarians
who
are
at
its
heels
hence
where
the
middle
class
insist
on
seeing
princesses
these
are
really
only
ladylike
young
women
in
these
days
princes
can
find
no
great
ladies
whom
they
may
compromise
they
can
not
even
confer
honor
on
a
woman
taken
up
at
random
the
duc
de
bourbon
was
the
last
prince
to
avail
himself
of
this
and
god
alone
knows
how
dearly
he
paid
for
it
said
lord
dudley
nowadays
princes
have
wives
obliged
to
share
their
with
other
ladies
royal
favor
could
not
raise
them
higher
by
a
hair
s
breadth
they
glide
unremarkable
between
the
waters
of
the
citizen
class
and
those
of
the
altogether
noble
nor
altogether
bourgeoises
said
the
marquise
de
rochegude
acridly
the
press
has
fallen
heir
to
the
woman
exclaimed
rastignac
she
no
longer
has
the
quality
of
a
spoken
calumnies
graced
by
elegant
language
we
read
feuilletons
written
in
a
dialect
which
changes
every
three
years
society
papers
about
as
mirthful
as
an
undertaker
s
mute
and
as
light
as
the
lead
of
their
type
french
conversation
is
carried
on
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
in
a
revolutionary
jargon
through
long
columns
of
type
printed
in
old
mansions
where
a
press
groans
in
the
place
where
formerly
elegant
company
used
to
the
knell
of
the
highest
society
is
tolling
said
a
russian
prince
do
you
hear
it
and
the
first
stroke
is
your
modern
word
you
are
right
prince
said
de
marsay
the
perfect
lady
issuing
from
the
ranks
of
the
nobility
or
sprouting
from
the
citizen
class
and
the
product
of
every
soil
even
of
the
provinces
is
the
expression
of
these
times
a
last
remaining
embodiment
of
good
taste
grace
wit
and
distinction
all
combined
but
dwarfed
we
shall
see
no
more
great
ladies
in
france
but
there
will
be
ladies
for
a
long
time
elected
by
public
opinion
to
form
an
upper
chamber
of
women
and
who
will
be
among
the
fair
sex
what
a
gentleman
is
in
and
that
they
call
progress
exclaimed
mademoiselle
des
touches
i
should
like
to
know
where
the
progress
lies
why
in
this
said
madame
de
nucingen
formerly
a
woman
might
have
the
voice
of
a
the
walk
of
a
grenadier
the
face
of
an
impudent
courtesan
her
hair
too
high
on
her
forehead
a
large
foot
a
thick
was
a
great
lady
in
spite
of
it
all
but
in
these
days
even
if
she
were
a
a
montmorency
would
ever
be
such
a
would
not
be
a
but
what
do
you
mean
by
a
perfect
lady
asked
count
adam
laginski
she
is
a
modern
product
a
deplorable
triumph
of
the
elective
system
as
applied
to
the
fair
sex
said
the
minister
every
revolution
has
a
word
of
its
own
which
epitomizes
and
depicts
you
are
right
said
the
russian
who
had
come
to
make
a
literary
reputation
in
paris
the
explanation
of
certain
words
added
from
time
to
time
to
your
beautiful
language
would
make
a
magnificent
history
organize
for
instance
is
the
word
of
the
empire
and
sums
up
napoleon
but
all
that
does
not
explain
what
is
meant
by
a
lady
the
young
pole
exclaimed
with
some
impatience
well
i
will
tell
you
said
émile
blondet
to
count
adam
one
fine
morning
you
go
for
a
saunter
in
paris
it
is
past
two
but
five
has
not
yet
struck
you
see
a
woman
coming
towards
you
your
first
glance
at
her
is
like
the
preface
to
a
good
book
it
leads
you
to
expect
a
world
of
elegance
and
refinement
like
a
botanist
over
hill
and
dale
in
his
pursuit
of
plants
among
the
vulgarities
of
paris
life
you
have
at
last
found
a
rare
flower
this
woman
is
attended
by
two
very
men
of
whom
one
at
any
rate
wears
an
order
or
else
a
servant
out
of
livery
follows
her
at
a
distance
of
ten
yards
she
displays
no
gaudy
colors
no
stockings
no
no
embroidered
frills
to
her
drawers
fussing
round
her
ankles
you
will
see
that
she
is
shod
with
prunella
shoes
with
sandals
crossed
over
extremely
fine
cotton
stockings
or
plain
gray
silk
stockings
or
perhaps
she
wears
boots
of
the
most
exquisite
simplicity
you
notice
that
her
gown
is
made
of
a
neat
and
inexpensive
material
but
made
in
a
way
that
surprises
more
than
one
woman
of
the
middle
class
it
is
almost
always
a
long
pelisse
with
bows
to
fasten
it
and
neatly
bound
with
fine
cord
or
an
imperceptible
braid
the
unknown
has
a
way
of
her
own
in
wrapping
herself
in
her
shawl
or
mantilla
she
knows
how
to
draw
it
round
her
from
her
hips
to
her
neck
outlining
a
carapace
as
it
were
which
would
make
an
ordinary
woman
look
like
a
turtle
but
which
in
her
sets
off
the
most
beautiful
forms
while
concealing
them
how
does
she
do
it
this
secret
she
keeps
though
unguarded
by
any
patent
as
she
walks
she
gives
herself
a
little
concentric
and
harmonious
twist
which
makes
her
supple
or
dangerous
slenderness
writhe
under
the
stuff
as
a
snake
does
under
the
green
gauze
of
trembling
grass
is
it
to
an
angel
or
a
devil
that
she
owes
the
graceful
undulation
which
plays
under
her
long
black
silk
cape
stirs
its
lace
frill
sheds
an
airy
balm
and
what
i
should
like
to
call
the
breeze
of
a
parisienne
you
may
recognize
over
her
arms
round
her
waist
about
her
throat
a
science
of
drapery
recalling
the
antique
mnemosyne
oh
how
thoroughly
she
understands
the
cut
of
her
the
expression
study
the
way
she
puts
her
foot
forward
moulding
her
skirt
with
such
a
decent
preciseness
that
the
is
filled
with
admiration
mingled
with
desire
but
subdued
by
deep
respect
when
an
englishwoman
attempts
this
step
she
looks
like
a
grenadier
marching
forward
to
attack
a
redoubt
the
women
of
paris
have
a
genius
for
walking
the
municipality
really
owed
them
asphalt
footwalks
our
unknown
jostles
no
one
if
she
wants
to
pass
she
waits
with
proud
humility
till
some
one
makes
way
the
distinction
peculiar
to
a
woman
betrays
itself
especially
in
the
way
she
holds
her
shawl
or
cloak
crossed
over
her
bosom
even
as
she
walks
she
has
a
little
air
of
serene
dignity
like
raphael
s
madonnas
in
their
frames
her
aspect
at
once
quiet
and
disdainful
makes
the
most
insolent
dandy
step
aside
for
her
her
bonnet
remarkable
for
its
simplicity
is
trimmed
with
crisp
ribbons
there
may
be
flowers
in
it
but
the
cleverest
of
such
women
wear
only
bows
feathers
demand
a
carriage
flowers
are
too
showy
beneath
it
you
see
the
fresh
unworn
face
of
a
woman
who
without
conceit
is
sure
of
herself
who
looks
at
nothing
and
sees
everything
whose
vanity
satiated
by
being
constantly
gratified
stamps
her
face
with
an
indifference
which
piques
your
curiosity
she
knows
that
she
is
looked
at
she
knows
that
everybody
even
women
turn
round
to
see
her
again
and
she
threads
her
way
through
paris
like
a
gossamer
spotless
and
pure
this
delightful
species
affects
the
hottest
latitudes
the
cleanest
longitudes
of
paris
you
will
meet
her
between
the
and
arcade
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
along
the
line
of
the
boulevards
from
the
equator
of
the
passage
des
panoramas
where
the
products
of
india
flourish
where
the
warmest
creations
of
industry
are
displayed
to
the
cape
of
the
madeleine
in
the
least
muddy
districts
of
the
citizen
quarters
between
no
and
no
of
the
rue
du
faubourg
during
the
winter
she
haunts
the
terrace
of
the
feuillants
but
not
the
asphalt
pavement
that
lies
parallel
according
to
the
weather
she
may
be
seen
flying
in
the
avenue
of
the
which
is
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
place
louis
on
the
west
by
the
avenue
de
marigny
to
the
south
by
the
road
to
the
north
by
the
gardens
of
the
faubourg
never
is
this
pretty
variety
of
woman
to
be
seen
in
the
hyperborean
regions
of
the
rue
never
in
the
kamtschatka
of
miry
narrow
commercial
streets
never
anywhere
in
bad
weather
these
flowers
of
paris
blooming
only
in
oriental
weather
perfume
the
highways
and
after
five
o
clock
fold
up
like
flowers
the
women
you
will
see
later
looking
a
little
like
them
are
ladies
while
the
fair
unknown
your
beatrice
of
a
day
is
a
perfect
it
is
not
very
easy
for
a
foreigner
my
dear
count
to
recognize
the
differences
by
which
the
observer
emeritus
distinguishes
are
such
consummate
actresses
but
they
are
glaring
in
the
eyes
of
parisians
hooks
ill
fastened
strings
showing
loops
of
tape
through
a
gaping
slit
in
the
back
rubbed
ironed
an
skirt
an
waist
you
will
see
a
certain
effort
in
the
intentional
droop
of
the
eyelid
there
is
something
conventional
in
the
attitude
as
to
the
bourgeoise
the
citizen
womankind
she
can
not
possibly
be
mistaken
for
the
spell
cast
over
you
by
the
unknown
she
is
bustling
and
goes
out
in
all
weathers
trots
about
comes
goes
gazes
does
not
know
whether
she
will
or
will
not
go
into
a
shop
where
the
lady
knows
just
what
she
wants
and
what
she
is
doing
the
townswoman
is
undecided
tucks
up
her
skirts
to
cross
a
gutter
dragging
a
child
by
the
hand
which
compels
her
to
look
out
for
the
vehicles
she
is
a
mother
in
public
and
talks
to
her
daughter
she
carries
money
in
her
bag
and
has
stockings
on
her
feet
in
winter
she
wears
a
boa
over
her
fur
cloak
in
summer
a
shawl
and
a
scarf
she
is
accomplished
in
the
redundancies
of
dress
you
will
meet
the
fair
unknown
again
at
the
italiens
at
the
opéra
at
a
ball
she
will
then
appear
under
such
a
different
aspect
that
you
would
think
them
two
beings
devoid
of
any
analogy
the
woman
has
emerged
from
those
mysterious
garments
like
a
butterfly
from
its
silky
cocoon
she
serves
up
like
some
rare
dainty
to
your
lavished
eyes
the
forms
which
her
bodice
scarcely
revealed
in
the
morning
at
the
theatre
she
never
mounts
higher
than
the
second
tier
excepting
at
the
italiens
you
can
there
watch
at
your
leisure
the
studied
deliberateness
of
her
movements
the
enchanting
deceiver
plays
off
all
the
little
political
artifices
of
her
sex
so
naturally
as
to
exclude
all
idea
of
art
or
premeditation
if
she
has
a
royally
beautiful
hand
the
most
perspicacious
beholder
will
believe
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
twist
or
refix
or
push
aside
the
ringlet
or
curl
she
plays
with
if
she
has
some
dignity
of
profile
you
will
be
persuaded
that
she
is
giving
irony
or
grace
to
what
she
says
to
her
neighbor
sitting
in
such
a
position
as
to
produce
the
magical
effect
of
the
lost
profile
so
dear
to
great
painters
by
which
the
cheek
catches
the
high
light
the
nose
is
shown
in
clear
outline
the
nostrils
are
transparently
rosy
the
forehead
squarely
modeled
the
eye
has
its
spangle
of
fire
but
fixed
on
space
and
the
white
roundness
of
the
chin
is
accentuated
by
a
line
of
light
if
she
has
a
pretty
foot
she
will
throw
herself
on
a
sofa
with
the
coquettish
grace
of
a
cat
in
the
sunshine
her
feet
outstretched
without
your
feeling
that
her
attitude
is
anything
but
the
most
charming
model
ever
given
to
a
sculptor
by
lassitude
only
the
perfect
lady
is
quite
at
her
ease
in
full
dress
nothing
inconveniences
her
you
will
never
see
her
like
the
woman
of
the
citizen
class
pulling
up
a
refractory
or
pushing
down
a
rebellious
whalebone
or
looking
whether
her
tucker
is
doing
its
office
of
faithful
guardian
to
two
treasures
of
dazzling
whiteness
or
glancing
in
the
mirrors
to
see
if
her
is
keeping
its
place
her
toilet
is
always
in
harmony
with
her
character
she
had
had
time
to
study
herself
to
learn
what
becomes
her
for
she
has
long
known
what
does
not
suit
her
you
will
not
find
her
as
you
go
out
she
vanishes
before
the
end
of
the
play
if
by
chance
she
is
to
be
seen
calm
and
stately
on
the
stairs
she
is
experiencing
some
violent
emotion
she
has
to
bestow
a
glance
to
receive
a
promise
perhaps
she
goes
down
so
slowly
on
purpose
to
gratify
the
vanity
of
a
slave
whom
she
sometimes
obeys
if
your
meeting
takes
place
at
a
ball
or
an
evening
party
you
will
gather
the
honey
natural
or
affected
of
her
insinuating
voice
her
empty
words
will
enchant
you
and
she
will
know
how
to
give
them
the
value
of
thought
by
her
inimitable
to
be
such
a
woman
is
it
not
necessary
to
be
very
clever
asked
the
polish
count
it
is
necessary
to
have
great
taste
replied
the
princesse
de
cadignan
and
in
france
taste
is
more
than
cleverness
said
the
russian
this
woman
s
cleverness
is
the
triumph
of
a
purely
plastic
art
blondet
went
on
you
will
not
know
what
she
said
but
you
will
be
fascinated
she
will
toss
her
head
or
gently
shrug
her
white
shoulders
she
will
gild
an
insignificant
speech
with
a
charming
pout
and
smile
or
throw
a
voltairean
epigram
into
an
indeed
an
ah
a
what
then
a
jerk
of
her
head
will
be
her
most
pertinent
form
of
questioning
she
will
give
meaning
to
the
movement
by
which
she
twirls
a
vinaigrette
hanging
to
her
finger
by
a
ring
she
gets
an
artificial
grandeur
out
of
superlative
trivialities
she
simply
drops
her
hand
impressively
letting
it
fall
over
the
arm
of
her
chair
as
dewdrops
hang
on
the
cup
of
a
flower
and
all
is
has
pronounced
judgment
beyond
appeal
to
the
apprehension
of
the
most
obtuse
she
knows
how
to
listen
to
you
she
gives
you
the
opportunity
of
shining
ask
your
moments
are
rare
the
candid
simplicity
of
the
young
pole
to
whom
blondet
spoke
made
all
the
party
shout
with
laughter
now
you
will
not
talk
for
with
a
bourgeoise
without
her
alluding
to
her
husband
in
one
way
or
another
blondet
went
on
with
unperturbed
gravity
whereas
even
if
you
know
that
your
lady
is
married
she
will
have
the
delicacy
to
conceal
her
husband
so
effectually
that
it
will
need
the
enterprise
of
christopher
columbus
to
discover
him
often
you
will
fail
in
the
attempt
if
you
have
had
no
opportunity
of
inquiring
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
you
detect
her
gazing
fixedly
at
a
man
wearing
a
decoration
who
bows
and
goes
out
she
has
ordered
her
carriage
and
goes
you
are
not
the
rose
but
you
have
been
with
the
rose
and
you
go
to
bed
under
the
golden
canopy
of
a
delicious
dream
which
will
last
perhaps
after
sleep
with
his
heavy
finger
has
opened
the
ivory
gates
of
the
temple
of
dreams
the
lady
when
she
is
at
home
sees
no
one
before
four
she
is
shrewd
enough
always
to
keep
you
waiting
in
her
house
you
will
find
everything
in
good
taste
her
luxury
is
for
hourly
use
and
duly
renewed
you
will
see
nothing
under
glass
shades
no
rags
of
wrappings
hanging
about
and
looking
like
a
pantry
you
will
find
the
staircase
warmed
flowers
on
all
sides
will
charm
your
the
only
gift
she
accepts
and
those
only
from
certain
people
for
nosegays
live
but
a
day
they
give
pleasure
and
must
be
replaced
to
her
they
are
as
in
the
east
a
symbol
and
a
promise
the
costly
toys
of
fashion
lie
about
but
not
so
as
to
suggest
a
museum
or
a
curiosity
shop
you
will
find
her
sitting
by
the
fire
in
a
low
chair
from
which
she
will
not
rise
to
greet
you
her
talk
will
not
now
be
what
it
was
at
the
ball
there
she
was
our
creditor
in
her
own
home
she
owes
you
the
pleasure
of
her
wit
these
are
the
shades
of
which
the
lady
is
a
marvelous
mistress
what
she
likes
in
you
is
a
man
to
swell
her
circle
an
object
for
the
cares
and
attentions
which
such
women
are
now
happy
to
bestow
therefore
to
attract
you
to
her
she
will
be
bewitchingly
charming
this
especially
is
where
you
feel
how
isolated
women
are
nowadays
and
why
they
want
a
little
world
of
their
own
to
which
they
may
seem
a
constellation
conversation
is
impossible
without
yes
said
de
marsay
you
have
truly
hit
the
fault
of
our
age
the
volume
in
a
longer
strikes
as
it
did
in
the
eighteenth
century
at
persons
or
at
things
but
at
squalid
events
and
it
dies
in
a
hence
said
blondet
the
intelligence
of
the
lady
if
she
has
any
consists
in
casting
doubts
on
everything
here
lies
the
great
difference
between
two
women
the
townswoman
is
certainly
virtuous
the
lady
does
not
know
yet
whether
she
is
or
whether
she
always
will
be
she
hesitates
and
struggles
where
the
other
refuses
and
falls
full
length
this
hesitancy
in
everything
is
one
of
the
last
graces
left
to
her
by
our
horrible
times
she
rarely
goes
to
church
but
she
will
talk
to
you
of
religion
and
if
you
have
the
good
taste
to
affect
she
will
try
to
convert
you
for
you
will
have
opened
the
way
for
the
stereotyped
phrases
the
and
gestures
understood
by
all
these
women
for
shame
i
thought
you
had
too
much
sense
to
attack
religion
society
is
tottering
and
you
deprive
it
of
its
support
why
religion
at
this
moment
means
you
and
me
it
is
property
and
the
future
of
our
children
ah
let
us
not
be
selfish
individualism
is
the
disease
of
the
age
and
religion
is
the
only
remedy
it
unites
families
which
your
laws
put
asunder
and
so
forth
then
she
plunges
into
some
speech
sprinkled
with
political
notions
which
is
neither
catholic
nor
moral
oh
deuced
moral
which
you
may
recognize
a
fag
end
of
every
material
woven
by
modern
doctrines
at
loggerheads
the
women
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
airs
by
which
blondet
illustrated
his
satire
this
explanation
dear
count
adam
said
blondet
turning
to
the
pole
will
have
proved
to
you
that
the
perfect
lady
represents
the
intellectual
no
less
than
the
political
muddle
just
as
she
is
surrounded
by
the
showy
and
not
very
lasting
products
of
an
industry
which
is
always
aiming
at
destroying
its
work
in
order
to
replace
it
by
something
else
when
you
leave
her
you
say
to
yourself
she
certainly
has
superior
ideas
and
you
believe
it
all
the
more
because
she
will
have
sounded
your
heart
with
a
delicate
touch
and
have
asked
you
your
secrets
she
affects
ignorance
to
learn
everything
there
are
some
things
she
never
knows
not
even
when
she
knows
them
you
alone
will
be
uneasy
you
will
know
nothing
of
the
state
of
her
heart
the
great
ladies
of
old
flaunted
their
with
newspapers
and
advertisements
in
these
days
the
lady
has
her
little
passion
neatly
ruled
like
a
sheet
of
music
with
its
crotchets
and
quavers
and
minims
its
rests
its
pauses
its
sharps
to
sign
the
key
a
mere
weak
women
she
is
anxious
not
to
compromise
her
love
or
her
husband
or
the
future
of
her
children
name
position
and
fortune
are
no
longer
flags
so
respected
as
to
protect
all
kinds
of
merchandise
on
board
the
whole
aristocracy
no
longer
advances
in
a
body
to
screen
the
lady
she
has
not
like
the
great
lady
of
the
past
the
demeanor
of
lofty
antagonism
she
can
crush
nothing
under
foot
it
is
she
who
would
be
crushed
thus
she
is
apt
at
jesuitical
she
is
a
creature
of
equivocal
compromises
of
guarded
proprieties
of
anonymous
passions
steered
between
two
shores
she
is
as
much
afraid
of
her
servants
as
an
englishwoman
who
lives
in
dread
of
a
trial
in
the
this
free
at
a
ball
so
attractive
out
a
slave
at
home
she
is
never
independent
but
in
perfect
privacy
or
theoretically
she
must
preserve
herself
in
her
position
as
a
lady
this
is
her
task
for
in
our
day
a
woman
repudiated
by
her
husband
reduced
to
a
meagre
allowance
with
no
carriage
no
luxury
no
none
of
the
divine
accessories
of
the
toilet
is
no
longer
a
wife
a
maid
or
a
townswoman
she
is
adrift
and
becomes
a
chattel
the
carmelites
will
not
receive
a
married
woman
it
would
be
bigamy
would
her
lover
still
have
anything
to
say
to
her
that
is
the
question
thus
your
perfect
lady
may
perhaps
give
occasion
to
calumny
never
to
it
is
all
so
horribly
true
said
the
princesse
de
cadignan
and
so
said
blondet
our
perfect
lady
lives
between
english
hypocrisy
and
the
delightful
frankness
of
the
eighteenth
bastard
system
symptomatic
of
an
age
in
which
nothing
that
grows
up
is
at
all
like
the
thing
that
has
vanished
in
which
transition
leads
nowhere
everything
is
a
matter
of
degree
all
the
great
figures
shrink
into
the
background
and
distinction
is
purely
personal
i
am
fully
convinced
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
woman
even
if
she
were
born
close
to
a
throne

might
make
them
seem
praise

addressed
to
camille
maupin
this

he
added
you
need
not
owe
napoleon
any
grudge
on
that
score
said
canalis
with
an
emphatic
tone
and
gesture
it
was
one
of
his
weaknesses
to
be
jealous
of
literary
he
had
his
mean
points
who
will
ever
explain
depict
or
understand
napoleon
a
man
represented
with
his
arms
folded
and
who
did
everything
who
was
the
greatest
force
ever
known
the
most
concentrated
the
most
mordant
the
most
acid
of
all
forces
a
singular
genius
who
carried
armed
civilization
in
every
direction
without
fixing
it
anywhere
a
man
who
could
do
everything
because
he
willed
everything
a
prodigious
phenomenon
of
will
conquering
an
illness
by
a
battle
and
yet
doomed
to
die
of
disease
in
bed
after
living
in
the
midst
of
ball
and
bullets
a
man
with
a
code
and
a
sword
in
his
brain
word
and
deed
a
spirit
that
foresaw
everything
but
his
own
fall
a
capricious
politician
who
risked
men
by
handfuls
out
of
economy
and
who
spared
three
of
talleyrand
of
pozzo
de
borgo
and
of
metternich
diplomatists
whose
death
would
have
saved
the
french
empire
and
who
seemed
to
him
of
greater
weight
than
thousands
of
soldiers
a
man
to
whom
nature
as
a
rare
privilege
had
given
a
heart
in
a
frame
of
bronze
mirthful
and
kind
at
midnight
amid
women
and
next
morning
manipulating
europe
as
a
young
girl
might
amuse
herself
by
splashing
water
in
her
bath
hypocritical
and
generous
loving
tawdriness
and
simplicity
devoid
of
taste
but
protecting
the
arts

in
spite
of
these
antitheses
really
great

everything
by
instinct
or
by
temperament
caesar
at
cromwell
at
thirty
and
then
like
my
grocer
buried
in
père
lachaise
a
good
husband
and
a
good
father
in
short
he
improvised
public
works
empires
kings
codes
verses
a
all
with
more
range
than
precision
did
he
not
aim
at
making
all
europe
france
and
after
making
us
weigh
on
the
earth
in
such
a
way
as
to
change
the
laws
of
gravitation
he
left
us
poorer
than
on
the
day
when
he
first
laid
hands
on
us
while
he
who
had
taken
an
empire
by
his
name
lost
his
name
on
the
frontier
of
his
empire
in
a
sea
of
blood
and
soldiers
a
man
all
thought
and
all
action
who
comprehended
desaix
and
all
despotism
and
all
justice
at
the
right
moments
the
true
king
said
de
marsay
ah
vat
a
pleashre
it
is
to
dichest
vile
you
talk
said
baron
de
nucingen
but
do
you
suppose
that
the
treat
we
are
giving
you
is
a
common
one
asked
joseph
bridau
if
you
had
to
pay
for
the
charms
of
conversation
as
you
do
for
those
of
dancing
or
of
music
your
fortune
would
be
inadequate
there
is
no
second
performance
of
the
same
flash
of
and
are
we
really
so
much
deteriorated
as
these
gentlemen
think
said
the
princesse
de
cadignan
addressing
the
women
with
a
smile
at
once
sceptical
and
ironical
because
in
these
days
under
a
regime
which
makes
everything
small
you
prefer
small
dishes
small
rooms
small
pictures
small
articles
small
newspapers
small
books
does
that
prove
that
women
too
have
grown
smaller
why
should
the
human
heart
change
because
you
change
your
coat
in
all
ages
the
passions
remain
the
same
i
know
cases
of
beautiful
devotion
of
sublime
sufferings
which
lack
the
glory
if
you
formerly
gave
lustre
to
the
errors
of
some
women
but
though
one
may
not
have
saved
a
king
of
france
one
is
not
the
less
an
agnès
sorel
do
you
believe
that
our
dear
marquise
d
espard
is
not
the
peer
of
madame
doublet
or
madame
du
deffant
in
whose
rooms
so
much
evil
was
spoken
and
done
is
not
taglioni
a
match
for
camargo
or
malibran
the
equal
of
are
not
our
poets
superior
to
those
of
the
eighteenth
century
if
at
this
moment
through
the
fault
of
the
grocers
who
govern
us
we
have
not
a
style
of
our
own
had
not
the
empire
its
distinguishing
stamp
as
the
age
of
louis
xv
had
and
was
not
its
splendor
fabulous
have
the
sciences
lost
anything
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
madame
the
women
of
this
age
are
truly
great
replied
the
comte
de
vandenesse
when
posterity
shall
have
followed
us
will
not
madame
recamier
appear
in
proportions
as
fine
as
those
of
the
most
beautiful
women
of
the
past
we
have
made
so
much
history
that
historians
will
be
lacking
the
age
of
louis
xiv
had
but
one
madame
de
sévigné
we
have
a
thousand
now
in
paris
who
certainly
write
better
than
she
did
and
who
do
not
publish
their
letters
whether
the
frenchwoman
be
called
perfect
lady
or
great
lady
she
will
always
be
the
woman
among
women
émile
blondet
has
given
us
a
picture
of
the
fascinations
of
a
woman
of
the
day
but
at
need
this
creature
who
bridles
or
shows
off
who
chirps
out
the
ideas
of
mr
this
and
that
would
be
heroic
and
it
must
be
said
your
faults
mesdames
are
all
the
more
poetical
because
they
must
always
and
under
all
circumstances
be
surrounded
by
greater
perils
i
have
seen
much
of
the
world
i
have
studied
it
perhaps
too
late
but
in
cases
where
the
illegality
of
your
feelings
might
be
excused
i
have
always
observed
the
effects
of
i
know
not
what
you
may
call
overwhelming
such
as
we
consider
light
i
hope
said
madame
de
vandenesse
that
we
can
be
great
in
other
oh
let
the
comte
de
vandenesse
preach
to
us
exclaimed
madame
de
serizy
with
all
the
more
reason
because
he
has
preached
a
great
deal
by
example
said
the
baronne
de
nucingen
on
my
honor
said
general
de
montriveau
in
all
the
word
you
are
very
fond
of
he
said
looking
at
in
which
the
finger
of
god
has
been
visible
the
most
frightful
i
ever
knew
was
very
near
being
by
my
well
tell
us
all
about
it
cried
lady
barimore
i
love
to
shudder
it
is
the
taste
of
a
virtuous
woman
replied
de
marsay
looking
at
lord
dudley
s
lovely
daughter
during
the
campaign
of
general
de
montriveau
began
i
was
the
involuntary
cause
of
a
terrible
disaster
which
may
be
of
use
to
you
doctor
bianchon
turning
to
me
since
while
devoting
yourself
to
the
human
body
you
concern
yourself
a
good
deal
with
the
mind
it
may
tend
to
solve
some
of
the
problems
of
the
will
i
was
going
through
my
second
campaign
i
enjoyed
danger
and
laughed
at
everything
like
the
young
and
foolish
lieutenant
of
artillery
that
i
was
when
we
reached
the
beresina
the
army
had
as
you
know
lost
all
discipline
and
had
forgotten
military
obedience
it
was
a
medley
of
men
of
all
nations
instinctively
making
their
way
from
north
to
south
the
soldiers
would
drive
a
general
in
rags
and
away
from
their
fire
if
he
brought
neither
wood
nor
victuals
after
the
passage
of
this
famous
river
disorder
did
not
diminish
i
had
come
quietly
and
alone
without
food
out
of
the
marshes
of
zembin
and
was
wandering
in
search
of
a
house
where
i
might
be
taken
in
finding
none
or
driven
away
from
those
i
came
across
happily
towards
evening
i
perceived
a
wretched
little
polish
farm
of
which
nothing
can
give
you
any
idea
unless
you
have
seen
the
wooden
houses
of
lower
normandy
or
the
poorest
of
la
beauce
these
dwellings
consist
of
a
single
room
with
one
end
divided
off
by
a
wooden
partition
the
smaller
division
serving
as
a
for
forage
in
the
darkness
of
twilight
i
could
just
see
a
faint
smoke
rising
above
this
house
hoping
to
find
there
some
comrades
more
compassionate
than
those
i
had
hitherto
addressed
i
boldly
walked
as
far
as
the
farm
on
going
in
i
found
the
table
laid
several
officers
and
with
them
a
common
sight
eating
potatoes
some
horseflesh
broiled
over
the
charcoal
and
some
frozen
beetroots
i
recognized
among
the
company
two
or
three
artillery
captains
of
the
regiment
in
which
i
had
first
served
i
was
welcomed
with
a
shout
of
acclamation
which
would
have
amazed
me
greatly
on
the
other
side
of
the
beresina
but
at
this
moment
the
cold
was
less
intense
my
were
resting
they
were
warm
they
had
food
and
the
room
strewn
with
trusses
of
straw
gave
the
promise
of
a
delightful
night
we
did
not
ask
for
so
much
in
those
days
my
comrades
could
be
philanthropists
of
the
commonest
ways
of
being
philanthropic
i
sat
down
to
eat
on
one
of
the
bundles
of
straw
at
the
end
of
the
table
by
the
side
of
the
door
opening
into
the
smaller
room
full
of
straw
and
hay
sat
my
old
colonel
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
men
i
ever
saw
among
all
the
mixed
collection
of
men
it
has
been
my
lot
to
meet
he
was
an
italian
now
whenever
human
nature
is
truly
fine
in
the
lands
of
the
south
it
is
really
sublime
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
ever
observed
the
extreme
fairness
of
italians
when
they
are
fair
it
is
exquisite
especially
under
an
artificial
light
when
i
read
the
fantastical
portrait
of
colonel
oudet
sketched
by
charles
nodier
i
found
my
own
sensations
in
every
one
of
his
elegant
phrases
italian
then
as
were
most
of
the
officers
of
his
regiment
which
had
in
fact
been
borrowed
by
the
emperor
from
eugene
s
army
my
colonel
was
a
tall
man
at
least
eight
or
nine
inches
above
the
standard
and
was
admirably
little
stout
perhaps
but
prodigiously
powerful
active
and
as
a
greyhound
his
black
hair
in
abundant
curls
showed
up
his
complexion
as
white
as
a
woman
s
he
had
small
hands
a
shapely
foot
a
pleasant
mouth
and
an
aquiline
nose
delicately
formed
of
which
the
tip
used
to
become
naturally
pinched
and
white
whenever
he
was
angry
as
happened
often
his
irascibility
was
so
far
beyond
belief
that
i
will
tell
you
nothing
about
it
you
will
have
the
opportunity
of
judging
of
it
no
one
could
be
calm
in
his
presence
i
alone
perhaps
was
not
afraid
of
him
he
had
indeed
taken
such
a
singular
fancy
to
me
that
he
thought
everything
i
did
right
when
he
was
in
a
rage
his
brow
was
knit
and
the
muscles
of
the
middle
of
his
forehead
set
in
a
delta
or
to
be
more
explicit
in
redgauntlet
s
horseshoe
this
mark
was
perhaps
even
more
terrifying
than
the
magnetic
flashes
of
his
blue
eyes
his
whole
frame
quivered
and
his
strength
great
as
it
was
in
his
normal
state
became
almost
unbounded
he
spoke
with
a
strong
guttural
roll
his
voice
at
least
as
powerful
as
that
of
charles
nordier
s
oudet
threw
an
incredible
fulness
of
tone
into
the
syllable
or
the
consonant
in
which
this
burr
was
sounded
though
this
faulty
pronunciation
was
at
times
a
grace
when
commanding
his
men
or
when
he
was
excited
you
can
not
imagine
unless
you
had
heard
it
what
force
was
expressed
by
this
accent
which
at
paris
is
so
common
when
the
colonel
was
quiescent
his
blue
eyes
were
angelically
sweet
and
his
smooth
brow
had
a
most
charming
expression
on
parade
or
with
the
army
of
italy
not
a
man
could
compare
with
him
indeed
d
orsay
himself
the
handsome
d
orsay
was
eclipsed
by
our
colonel
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
review
held
by
napoleon
before
the
invasion
of
russia
everything
was
in
contrasts
in
this
exceptional
man
passion
lives
on
contrast
hence
you
need
not
ask
whether
he
exerted
over
women
the
irresistible
influences
to
which
our
nature
yields
the
general
looked
at
the
princesse
de
as
vitreous
matter
is
moulded
under
the
pipe
of
the
still
by
a
singular
observer
might
perhaps
explain
the
colonel
was
not
a
or
was
indifferent
to
such
successes
to
give
you
an
idea
of
his
violence
i
will
tell
you
in
a
few
words
what
i
once
saw
him
do
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
we
were
dragging
our
guns
up
a
very
narrow
road
bordered
by
a
somewhat
high
slope
on
one
side
and
by
thickets
on
the
other
when
we
were
up
we
met
another
regiment
of
artillery
its
colonel
marching
at
the
head
this
colonel
wanted
to
make
the
captain
who
was
at
the
head
of
our
foremost
battery
back
down
again
the
captain
of
course
refused
but
the
colonel
of
the
other
regiment
signed
to
his
foremost
battery
to
advance
and
in
spite
of
the
care
the
driver
took
to
keep
among
the
scrub
the
wheel
of
the
first
gun
struck
our
captain
s
right
leg
and
broke
it
throwing
him
over
on
the
near
side
of
his
horse
all
this
was
the
work
of
a
moment
our
colonel
who
was
but
a
little
way
off
guessed
that
there
was
a
quarrel
he
galloped
up
riding
among
the
guns
at
the
risk
of
falling
with
his
horse
s
four
feet
in
the
air
and
reached
the
spot
face
to
face
with
the
other
colonel
at
the
very
moment
when
the
captain
fell
calling
out
help
no
our
italian
colonel
was
no
longer
human
foam
like
the
froth
of
champagne
rose
to
his
lips
he
roared
inarticulately
like
a
lion
incapable
of
uttering
a
word
or
even
a
cry
he
made
a
terrific
signal
to
his
antagonist
pointing
to
the
wood
and
drawing
his
sword
the
two
colonels
went
aside
in
two
seconds
we
saw
our
colonel
s
opponent
stretched
on
the
ground
his
skull
split
in
two
the
soldiers
of
his
regiment
by
heaven
and
pretty
quickly
too
the
captain
who
had
been
so
nearly
crushed
and
who
lay
yelping
in
the
puddle
where
the
gun
carriage
had
thrown
him
had
an
italian
wife
a
beautiful
sicilian
of
messina
who
was
not
indifferent
to
our
colonel
this
circumstance
had
aggravated
his
rage
he
was
pledged
to
protect
the
husband
bound
to
defend
him
as
he
would
have
defended
the
woman
herself
now
in
the
hovel
beyond
zembin
where
i
was
so
well
received
this
captain
was
sitting
opposite
to
me
and
his
wife
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
facing
the
colonel
this
sicilian
was
a
little
woman
named
rosina
very
dark
but
with
all
the
fire
of
the
southern
sun
in
her
black
eyes
at
this
moment
she
was
deplorably
thin
her
face
was
covered
with
dust
like
fruit
exposed
to
the
drought
of
a
highroad
scarcely
clothed
in
rags
exhausted
by
marches
her
hair
in
disorder
and
clinging
together
under
a
piece
of
a
shawl
tied
close
over
her
head
still
she
had
the
graces
of
a
woman
her
movements
were
engaging
her
small
rose
mouth
and
white
teeth
the
outline
of
her
features
and
figure
charms
which
misery
cold
and
neglect
had
not
altogether
defaced
still
suggested
love
to
any
man
who
could
think
of
a
woman
rosina
had
one
of
those
frames
which
are
fragile
in
appearance
but
wiry
and
full
of
spring
her
husband
a
gentleman
of
piedmont
had
a
face
expressive
of
ironical
simplicity
if
it
is
allowable
to
ally
the
two
words
brave
and
well
informed
he
seemed
to
know
nothing
of
the
connections
which
had
subsisted
between
his
wife
and
the
colonel
for
three
years
past
i
ascribed
this
unconcern
to
italian
manners
or
to
some
domestic
secret
yet
there
was
in
the
man
s
countenance
one
feature
which
always
filled
me
with
involuntary
distrust
his
under
lip
which
was
thin
and
very
restless
turned
down
at
the
corners
instead
of
turning
up
and
this
as
i
thought
betrayed
a
streak
of
cruelty
in
a
character
which
seemed
so
phlegmatic
and
indolent
as
you
may
suppose
the
conversation
was
not
very
sparkling
when
i
went
in
my
weary
comrades
ate
in
silence
of
course
they
asked
me
some
questions
and
we
related
our
misadventures
mingled
with
reflections
on
the
campaign
the
generals
their
mistakes
the
russians
and
the
cold
a
minute
after
my
arrival
the
colonel
having
finished
his
meagre
meal
wiped
his
moustache
bid
us
shot
a
black
look
at
the
italian
woman
saying
rosina
and
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
went
into
the
little
barn
full
of
hay
to
bed
the
meaning
of
the
colonel
s
utterance
was
the
young
wife
replied
by
an
indescribable
gesture
expressing
all
the
annoyance
she
could
not
feel
at
seeing
her
thralldom
thus
flaunted
without
human
decency
and
the
offence
to
her
dignity
as
a
woman
and
to
her
husband
but
there
was
too
in
the
rigid
setting
of
her
features
and
the
tight
knitting
of
her
brows
a
sort
of
presentiment
perhaps
she
foresaw
her
fate
rosina
remained
quietly
in
her
place
a
minute
later
and
apparently
when
the
colonel
was
snug
in
his
couch
of
straw
or
hay
he
repeated
rosina
the
tone
of
this
second
call
was
even
more
brutally
questioning
than
the
first
the
colonel
s
strong
burr
and
the
length
which
the
italian
language
allows
to
be
given
to
vowels
and
the
final
syllable
concentrated
all
the
man
s
despotism
impatience
and
strength
of
will
rosina
turned
pale
but
she
rose
passed
behind
us
and
went
to
the
colonel
all
the
party
sat
in
utter
silence
i
unluckily
after
looking
at
them
all
began
to
laugh
and
then
they
all
laughed
tu
ridi
laugh
said
the
husband
on
my
honor
old
comrade
said
i
becoming
serious
again
i
confess
that
i
was
wrong
i
ask
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
and
if
you
are
not
satisfied
by
my
apologies
i
am
ready
to
give
you
oh
it
is
not
you
who
are
wrong
it
is
i
he
replied
coldly
thereupon
we
all
lay
down
in
the
room
and
before
long
all
were
sound
asleep
next
morning
each
one
without
rousing
his
neighbor
or
seeking
companionship
set
out
again
on
his
way
with
that
selfishness
which
made
our
rout
one
of
the
most
horrible
dramas
of
melancholy
and
horror
which
ever
was
enacted
under
heaven
nevertheless
at
about
seven
or
eight
hundred
paces
from
our
shelter
we
most
of
us
met
again
and
walked
on
together
like
geese
led
in
flocks
by
a
child
s
wilful
tyranny
the
same
necessity
urged
us
all
having
reached
a
knoll
where
we
could
still
see
the
farmhouse
where
we
had
spent
the
night
we
heard
sounds
resembling
the
roar
of
lions
in
the
desert
the
bellowing
of
it
was
a
noise
which
can
be
compared
to
no
known
cry
and
yet
mingling
with
this
horrible
and
ominous
roar
we
could
hear
a
woman
s
feeble
scream
we
all
looked
round
seized
by
i
know
not
what
impulse
of
terror
we
no
longer
saw
the
house
but
a
huge
bonfire
the
farmhouse
had
been
barricaded
and
was
in
flames
swirls
of
smoke
borne
on
the
wind
brought
us
hoarse
cries
and
an
indescribable
pungent
smell
a
few
yards
behind
the
captain
was
quietly
approaching
to
join
our
caravan
we
gazed
at
him
in
silence
for
no
one
dared
question
him
but
he
understanding
our
curiosity
pointed
to
his
breast
with
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
and
waving
the
left
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
he
said
we
all
walked
on
without
saying
a
word
to
there
is
nothing
more
terrible
than
the
revolt
of
a
sheep
said
de
marsay
it
would
be
frightful
to
let
us
leave
with
this
horrible
picture
in
our
memory
said
madame
de
montcornet
i
shall
dream
of
and
what
was
the
punishment
of
monsieur
de
marsay
s
first
said
lord
dudley
smiling
when
the
english
are
in
jest
their
foils
have
the
buttons
on
said
blondet
monsieur
bianchon
can
tell
us
for
he
saw
her
dying
replied
de
marsay
turning
to
me
yes
said
i
and
her
end
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
i
ever
saw
the
duke
and
i
had
spent
the
night
by
the
dying
woman
s
pillow
pulmonary
consumption
in
the
last
stage
left
no
hope
she
had
taken
the
sacrament
the
day
before
the
duke
had
fallen
asleep
the
duchess
waking
at
about
four
in
the
morning
signed
to
me
in
the
most
touching
way
with
a
friendly
smile
to
bid
me
leave
him
to
rest
and
she
meanwhile
was
about
to
die
she
had
become
incredibly
thin
but
her
face
had
preserved
its
really
sublime
outline
and
features
her
pallor
made
her
skin
look
like
porcelain
with
a
light
within
her
bright
eyes
and
color
contrasted
with
this
languidly
elegant
complexion
and
her
countenance
was
full
of
expressive
calm
she
seemed
to
pity
the
duke
and
the
feeling
had
its
origin
in
a
lofty
tenderness
which
as
death
approached
seemed
to
know
no
bounds
the
silence
was
absolute
the
room
softly
lighted
by
a
lamp
looked
like
every
sickroom
at
the
hour
of
death
at
this
moment
the
clock
struck
the
duke
awoke
and
was
in
despair
at
having
fallen
asleep
i
did
not
see
the
gesture
of
impatience
by
which
he
manifested
the
regret
he
felt
at
having
lost
sight
of
his
wife
for
a
few
of
the
last
minutes
vouchsafed
to
him
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
any
one
but
the
dying
woman
might
have
misunderstood
it
a
busy
statesman
always
thinking
of
the
interests
of
france
the
duke
had
a
thousand
odd
ways
on
the
surface
such
as
often
lead
to
a
man
of
genius
being
mistaken
for
a
madman
and
of
which
the
explanation
lies
in
the
exquisiteness
and
exacting
needs
of
their
intellect
he
came
to
seat
himself
in
an
armchair
by
his
wife
s
side
and
looked
fixedly
at
her
the
dying
woman
put
her
hand
out
a
little
way
took
her
husband
s
and
clasped
it
feebly
and
in
a
low
but
agitated
voice
she
said
my
poor
dear
who
is
left
to
understand
you
now
then
she
died
