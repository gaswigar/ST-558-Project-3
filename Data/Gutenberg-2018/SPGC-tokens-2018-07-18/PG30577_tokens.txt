preface
in
the
course
of
a
number
of
visits
to
constantinople
i
became
much
interested
in
the
tales
that
are
told
in
the
coffee
houses
these
are
usually
little
more
than
rooms
with
walls
made
of
small
panes
of
glass
the
furniture
consists
of
a
tripod
with
a
contrivance
for
holding
the
kettle
and
a
fire
to
keep
the
coffee
boiling
a
carpeted
bench
traverses
the
entire
length
of
the
room
this
is
occupied
by
turbaned
turks
their
legs
folded
under
them
smoking
nargilehs
or
chibooks
or
cigarettes
and
sipping
coffee
a
few
will
be
engaged
in
a
game
of
backgammon
but
the
majority
enter
into
conversation
at
first
only
in
syllables
which
gradually
gives
rise
to
a
general
discussion
finally
some
sage
of
the
neighborhood
comes
in
and
the
company
appeals
to
him
to
settle
the
point
at
issue
this
he
usually
does
by
telling
a
story
to
illustrate
his
opinion
some
of
the
stories
told
on
these
occasions
are
adaptations
of
those
already
known
in
arabic
and
persian
literature
but
the
turkish
mind
gives
them
a
new
setting
and
a
peculiar
philosophy
they
are
characteristic
of
the
habits
customs
and
methods
of
thought
of
the
people
and
for
this
reason
seem
worthy
of
preservation
two
of
these
tales
have
been
taken
from
the
armenian
and
were
received
from
ohannassian
of
constantinople
for
one
merciful
i
am
indebted
to
george
kennan
none
of
them
has
been
translated
from
any
book
or
manuscript
and
all
are
as
nearly
as
practicable
in
the
form
in
which
they
are
usually
narrated
most
of
the
stories
have
been
collected
by
allan
ramsay
who
by
a
long
residence
in
constantinople
has
had
special
opportunities
for
learning
to
know
the
modern
turk
it
is
due
to
him
however
to
say
that
for
the
style
and
editing
he
is
in
no
wise
responsible
and
that
all
sins
of
omission
and
commission
must
be
laid

allah
not
far
from
the
famous
mosque
bayezid
an
old
hodja
kept
a
school
and
very
skilfully
he
taught
the
rising
generation
the
everlasting
lesson
from
the
book
of
books
such
knowledge
had
he
of
human
nature
that
by
a
glance
at
his
pupil
he
could
at
once
tell
how
long
it
would
take
him
to
learn
a
quarter
of
the
koran
he
was
known
over
the
whole
empire
as
the
best
reciter
and
imparter
of
the
sacred
writings
of
the
prophet
for
many
years
this
hodja
famed
far
and
wide
as
the
hodja
of
hodjas
had
taught
in
this
little
school
the
number
of
times
he
had
recited
the
book
with
his
pupils
is
beyond
counting
and
should
we
attempt
to
consider
how
often
he
must
have
corrected
them
for
some
misplaced
word
our
beards
would
grow
gray
in
the
endeavor
swaying
to
and
fro
one
day
as
fast
as
his
old
age
would
let
him
and
reciting
to
his
pupils
the
latter
part
of
one
of
the
chapters
bakara
divine
inspiration
opened
his
inward
eye
and
led
him
to
pause
at
the
following
sentence
and
he
that
spends
his
money
in
the
ways
of
allah
is
likened
unto
a
grain
of
wheat
that
brings
forth
seven
sheaves
and
in
each
sheaf
an
hundred
grains
and
allah
giveth
twofold
unto
whom
he
pleaseth
as
his
pupils
one
after
the
other
recited
this
verse
to
him
he
wondered
why
he
had
overlooked
its
meaning
for
so
many
years
fully
convinced
that
anything
either
given
to
allah
or
in
the
way
that
he
proposes
was
an
investment
that
brought
a
percentage
undreamed
of
in
known
commerce
he
dismissed
his
pupils
and
putting
his
hand
into
his
bosom
drew
forth
from
the
many
folds
of
his
dress
a
bag
and
proceeded
to
count
his
worldly
possessions
carefully
and
attentively
he
counted
and
then
recounted
his
money
and
found
that
if
invested
in
the
ways
of
allah
it
would
bring
a
return
of
no
less
than
one
thousand
piasters
think
of
it
said
the
hodja
to
himself
one
thousand
piasters
one
thousand
piasters
mashallah
a
fortune
so
having
dismissed
his
school
he
sallied
forth
his
bag
of
money
in
his
hand
and
began
distributing
its
contents
to
the
needy
that
he
met
in
the
highways
ere
many
hours
had
passed
the
whole
of
his
savings
was
gone
the
hodja
was
very
happy
for
now
he
was
the
creditor
in
allah
books
for
one
thousand
piasters
he
returned
to
his
house
and
ate
his
evening
meal
of
bread
and
olives
and
was
content
the
next
day
came
the
thousand
piasters
had
not
yet
arrived
he
ate
his
bread
he
imagined
he
had
olives
and
was
content
the
third
day
came
the
old
hodja
had
no
bread
and
he
had
no
olives
he
suffered
the
pangs
of
hunger
so
when
the
end
of
the
day
had
come
and
his
pupils
had
departed
to
their
homes
the
hodja
with
a
full
heart
and
an
empty
stomach
walked
out
of
the
town
and
soon
got
beyond
the
city
walls
there
where
no
one
could
hear
him
he
lamented
his
sad
fate
and
the
great
calamity
that
had
befallen
him
in
his
old
age
what
sin
had
he
committed
what
great
wrong
had
his
ancestors
done
that
the
wrath
of
the
almighty
had
thus
fallen
on
him
when
his
earthly
course
was
run
ya
allah
allah
he
cried
and
beat
his
breast
as
if
in
answer
to
his
cry
the
howl
of
the
dreaded
fakir
dervish
came
over
across
the
plain
in
those
days
the
fakir
dervish
was
a
terror
in
the
land
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
it
was
opened
he
asked
and
received
food
if
refused
life
often
paid
the
penalty
the
hodja
lamentations
were
now
greater
than
ever
for
should
the
dervish
ask
him
for
food
and
the
hodja
have
nothing
to
give
he
would
certainly
be
killed
allah
allah
allah
guide
me
now
protect
one
of
your
faithful
followers
cried
the
frightened
hodja
and
he
looked
around
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
to
rescue
him
from
his
perilous
position
but
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
and
the
walls
of
the
city
were
five
miles
distant
just
then
the
howl
of
the
dervish
again
reached
his
ear
and
in
terror
he
flew
he
knew
not
whither
as
luck
would
have
it
he
came
upon
a
tree
up
which
although
stiff
from
age
and
weak
from
want
the
hodja
with
wonderful
agility
scrambled
and
trembling
like
a
leaf
awaited
his
fate
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
howling
dervish
till
at
last
his
long
hair
could
be
seen
floating
in
the
air
as
with
rapid
strides
he
preceded
the
wind
upon
his
endless
journey
on
and
on
he
came
his
wild
yell
sending
the
blood
from
very
fear
to
unknown
parts
of
the
poor
hodja
body
and
leaving
his
face
as
yellow
as
a
melon
to
his
utter
dismay
the
hodja
saw
the
dervish
approach
the
tree
and
sit
down
under
its
shade
sighing
deeply
the
dervish
said
in
a
loud
voice
why
have
i
come
into
this
world
why
were
my
forefathers
born
why
was
anybody
born
oh
allah
oh
allah
what
have
you
done
misery
misery
nothing
but
misery
to
mankind
and
everything
living
shall
i
not
be
avenged
for
all
the
misery
my
father
and
my
father
fathers
have
suffered
i
shall
be
avenged
striking
his
chest
a
loud
blow
as
if
to
emphasize
the
decision
he
had
come
to
the
dervish
took
a
small
bag
that
lay
by
his
side
and
slowly
proceeded
to
untie
the
leather
strings
that
bound
it
bringing
forth
from
it
a
small
image
he
gazed
at
it
a
moment
and
then
addressed
it
in
the
following
terms
you
job
you
bore
much
you
have
written
a
book
in
which
your
history
is
recorded
you
have
earned
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
patient
man
that
ever
lived
yet
i
have
read
your
history
and
found
that
when
real
affliction
oppressed
you
you
cursed
god
you
have
made
men
believe
too
that
there
is
a
reward
in
this
life
for
all
the
afflictions
they
suffer
you
have
misled
mankind
for
these
sins
no
one
has
ever
punished
you
now
i
will
punish
you
and
taking
his
long
curved
sword
in
his
hand
he
cut
off
the
head
of
the
figure
the
dervish
bent
forward
took
another
image
and
gazing
upon
it
with
a
contemptuous
smile
thus
addressed
it
david
david
singer
of
songs
of
peace
in
this
world
and
in
the
world
to
come
i
have
read
your
sayings
in
which
you
counsel
men
to
lead
a
righteous
life
for
the
sake
of
the
reward
which
they
are
to
receive
i
have
learned
that
you
have
misled
your
with
your
songs
of
peace
and
joy
i
have
read
your
history
and
i
find
that
you
have
committed
many
sins
for
these
sins
and
for
misleading
your
fellowmen
you
have
never
been
punished
now
i
will
punish
you
and
taking
his
sword
in
his
hand
he
cut
off
david
head
again
the
dervish
bent
forward
and
brought
forth
an
image
which
he
addressed
as
follows
you
solomon
are
reputed
to
have
been
the
wisest
man
that
ever
lived
you
had
command
over
the
host
of
the
genii
and
could
control
the
legion
of
the
demons
they
came
at
the
bidding
of
your
signet
ring
and
they
trembled
at
the
mysterious
names
to
which
you
gave
utterance
you
understood
every
living
thing
the
speech
of
the
beasts
of
the
field
of
the
birds
of
the
air
of
the
insects
of
the
earth
and
of
the
fishes
of
the
sea
was
known
unto
you
yet
when
i
read
your
history
i
found
that
in
spite
of
the
vast
knowledge
that
was
vouchsafed
unto
you
you
committed
many
wrongs
and
did
many
foolish
things
which
in
the
end
brought
misery
into
the
world
and
destruction
unto
your
people
and
for
all
these
no
one
has
ever
punished
you
now
i
will
punish
you
and
taking
his
sword
he
cut
off
solomon
head
again
the
dervish
bent
forward
and
brought
forth
from
the
bag
another
figure
which
he
addressed
thus
jesus
jesus
prophet
of
god
you
came
into
this
world
to
atone
by
giving
your
blood
for
the
sins
of
mankind
and
to
bring
unto
them
a
religion
of
peace
you
founded
a
church
whose
history
i
have
studied
and
i
see
that
it
set
fathers
against
their
children
and
brethren
against
one
another
that
it
brought
strife
into
the
world
that
the
lives
of
men
and
women
and
children
were
sacrificed
so
that
the
rivers
ran
red
with
blood
unto
the
seas
truly
you
were
a
great
prophet
but
the
misery
you
caused
must
be
avenged
for
it
no
one
has
yet
punished
you
now
i
will
punish
you
and
he
took
his
sword
and
cut
off
head
with
a
sorrowful
face
the
dervish
bent
forward
and
brought
forth
another
image
from
the
bag
mohammed
he
said
i
have
slain
job
david
solomon
and
jesus
what
shall
i
do
with
you
after
the
followers
of
jesus
had
shed
much
blood
their
religion
spread
over
the
world
was
acceptable
unto
man
and
the
nations
were
at
peace
then
you
came
into
the
world
and
you
brought
a
new
religion
and
father
rose
against
father
and
brother
rose
against
brother
hatred
was
sown
between
your
followers
and
the
followers
of
jesus
and
again
the
rivers
ran
red
with
blood
unto
the
seas
and
you
have
not
been
punished
for
this
i
will
punish
you
by
the
beard
of
my
forefathers
whose
blood
was
made
to
flow
in
your
cause
you
too
must
die
and
with
a
blow
the
head
of
mohammed
fell
to
the
ground
then
the
dervish
prostrated
himself
to
the
earth
and
after
a
silent
prayer
rose
and
brought
forth
from
the
bag
the
last
figure
reverently
he
bowed
to
it
and
then
he
addressed
it
as
follows
oh
allah
the
allah
of
allahs
there
is
but
one
allah
and
thou
art
he
i
have
slain
job
david
solomon
jesus
and
mohammed
for
the
folly
that
they
have
brought
into
the
world
thou
god
art
all
powerful
all
men
are
thy
children
thou
createst
them
and
bringest
them
into
the
world
the
thoughts
that
they
think
are
thy
thoughts
if
all
these
men
have
brought
all
this
evil
into
the
world
it
is
thy
fault
shall
i
punish
them
and
allow
thee
to
go
unhurt
no
i
must
punish
thee
also
and
he
raised
his
sword
to
strike
as
the
sword
circled
in
the
air
the
hodja
secreted
in
the
tree
forgot
the
fear
in
which
he
stood
of
the
dervish
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
cried
out
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
stop
stop
he
owes
me
one
thousand
piasters
the
dervish
reeled
and
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
the
hodja
was
overcome
at
his
own
words
and
trembled
with
fear
convinced
that
his
last
hour
had
arrived
the
dervish
lay
stretched
upon
his
back
on
the
grass
like
one
dead
at
last
the
hodja
took
courage
breaking
a
twig
from
off
the
tree
he
threw
it
down
upon
the
dervish
face
but
the
dervish
made
no
sign
the
hodja
took
more
courage
removed
one
of
his
heavy
outer
shoes
and
threw
it
on
the
outstretched
figure
of
the
dervish
but
still
the
dervish
lay
motionless
the
hodja
carefully
climbed
down
the
tree
gave
the
body
of
the
dervish
a
kick
and
climbed
back
again
and
still
the
dervish
did
not
stir
at
length
the
hodja
descended
from
the
tree
and
placed
his
ear
to
the
heart
it
did
not
beat
the
dervish
was
dead
ah
well
said
the
hodja
at
least
i
shall
not
starve
i
will
take
his
garments
and
sell
them
and
buy
me
some
bread
the
hodja
commenced
to
remove
the
dervish
garments
as
he
took
off
his
belt
he
found
that
it
was
heavy
he
opened
it
and
saw
that
it
contained
gold
he
counted
the
gold
and
found
that
it
was
exactly
one
thousand
piasters
the
hodja
turned
his
face
toward
mecca
and
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
said
oh
god
you
have
kept
your
promise
but
he
added
not
before
i
saved
your
life
better
is
the
folly
of
woman
than
the
wisdom
of
man
there
lived
in
constantinople
an
old
hodja
a
learned
man
who
had
a
son
the
boy
followed
in
his
father
footsteps
went
every
day
to
the
mosque
aya
sofia
seated
himself
in
a
secluded
spot
to
the
left
of
the
pillar
bearing
the
impress
of
the
conqueror
hand
and
engaged
in
the
study
of
the
koran
daily
he
might
be
seen
seated
swaying
his
body
to
and
fro
and
reciting
to
himself
the
verses
of
the
holy
book
the
dearest
wish
of
a
mohammedan
theological
student
is
to
be
able
to
recite
the
entire
koran
by
heart
many
years
are
spent
in
memorizing
the
holy
book
which
must
be
recited
with
a
prescribed
cantillation
and
in
acquiring
a
rhythmical
movement
of
the
body
which
accompanies
the
chant
when
abdul
for
that
was
the
young
man
name
had
reached
his
nineteenth
year
he
had
by
the
most
assiduous
study
finally
succeeded
in
mastering
of
the
koran
at
this
achievement
his
pride
rose
his
ambition
was
fired
and
he
determined
to
become
a
great
man
the
day
that
he
reached
this
decision
he
did
not
go
to
the
mosque
but
stopped
at
home
in
his
father
house
and
sat
staring
at
the
fire
burning
in
the
grate
several
times
the
father
asked
my
son
what
do
you
see
in
the
fire
and
each
time
the
son
answered
nothing
father
he
was
very
young
he
could
not
see
finally
the
young
man
picked
up
courage
and
gave
expression
to
his
thoughts
father
he
said
i
wish
to
become
a
great
man
that
is
very
easy
said
the
father
and
to
be
a
great
man
continued
the
son
i
must
first
go
to
mecca
for
no
mohammedan
priest
or
theologian
or
even
layman
has
fulfilled
all
of
the
cardinal
precepts
of
his
faith
unless
he
has
made
the
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
city
to
his
son
last
observation
the
father
blandly
replied
it
is
very
easy
to
go
to
mecca
how
easy
asked
the
son
on
the
contrary
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
journey
is
costly
and
i
have
no
money
listen
my
son
said
the
father
you
must
become
a
scribe
the
writer
of
the
thoughts
of
your
brethren
and
your
fortune
is
made
but
i
have
not
even
the
implements
necessary
for
a
scribe
said
the
son
all
that
can
be
easily
arranged
said
the
father
your
grandfather
had
an
i
will
give
it
you
i
will
buy
you
some
and
we
will
get
you
a
box
to
sit
in
all
that
you
need
to
do
is
to
sit
still
look
wise
and
your
fortune
is
made
and
indeed
the
advice
was
good
for
is
an
art
which
only
the
few
possess
the
ability
to
write
by
no
means
carries
with
it
the
ability
to
compose
epistolary
genius
is
rare
abdul
was
much
rejoiced
at
the
counsel
that
had
been
given
him
and
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
the
plan
he
took
his
the
paper
his
father
bought
got
himself
a
box
and
began
his
career
as
a
scribe
abdul
was
a
child
he
knew
nothing
but
deeming
himself
wise
he
sought
to
surpass
the
counsel
of
his
father
to
look
wise
he
said
is
not
sufficient
i
must
have
some
other
attraction
and
after
much
thought
he
hit
upon
the
following
idea
over
his
box
he
painted
a
legend
the
wisdom
of
man
is
greater
than
the
wisdom
of
woman
people
thought
the
sign
very
clever
customers
came
the
young
hodja
took
in
many
piasters
and
he
was
correspondingly
happy
this
sign
one
day
attracted
the
eyes
and
mind
of
a
hanoum
turkish
lady
seeing
that
abdul
was
a
manly
youth
she
went
to
him
and
said
hodja
i
have
a
difficult
letter
to
write
i
have
heard
that
thou
art
very
wise
so
i
have
come
to
thee
to
write
the
letter
thou
wilt
need
all
thy
wit
moreover
the
letter
is
a
long
one
and
i
can
not
stand
here
while
it
is
being
written
come
to
my
konak
house
at
three
this
afternoon
and
we
will
write
the
letter
the
hodja
was
overcome
with
admiration
for
his
fair
client
and
surprised
at
the
invitation
he
was
enchanted
his
heart
beat
wildly
and
so
great
was
his
agitation
that
his
reply
of
acquiescence
was
scarcely
audible
the
invitation
had
more
than
the
charm
of
novelty
to
make
it
attractive
he
had
never
talked
with
a
woman
outside
of
his
own
family
circle
to
be
admitted
to
a
lady
house
was
in
itself
an
adventure
long
before
the
appointed
time
the
young
hodja
impetuous
youth
gathered
together
his
reeds
ink
and
sand
with
feverish
step
he
wended
his
way
to
the
house
lattices
covered
the
windows
a
high
wall
surrounded
the
garden
and
a
ponderous
gate
barred
the
entrance
thrice
he
raised
the
massive
knocker
who
is
there
called
a
voice
from
within
the
scribe
was
the
reply
it
is
well
said
the
porter
the
gate
was
unbarred
and
the
hodja
permitted
to
enter
directly
he
was
ushered
into
the
apartment
of
his
fair
client
the
lady
welcomed
him
cordially
ah
hodja
effendi
i
am
glad
to
see
you
pray
sit
down
the
hodja
nervously
pulled
out
his
do
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
said
the
lady
refresh
yourself
take
a
cup
of
coffee
smoke
a
cigarette
and
we
will
write
the
letter
afterwards
so
he
lit
a
cigarette
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
and
they
fell
to
talking
time
flew
the
minutes
seemed
like
seconds
and
the
hours
were
as
minutes
while
they
were
thus
enjoying
themselves
there
suddenly
came
a
heavy
knock
at
the
gate
it
is
my
husband
the
pasha
cried
the
lady
what
shall
i
do
if
he
finds
you
here
he
will
kill
you
i
am
so
frightened
the
hodja
was
frightened
too
again
there
came
a
knock
at
the
gate
i
have
it
and
taking
abdul
by
the
arm
she
said
you
must
get
into
the
box
indicating
a
large
chest
in
the
room
quick
quick
if
you
prize
your
life
utter
not
a
word
and
inshallah
i
will
save
you
abdul
now
too
late
saw
his
folly
it
was
his
want
of
experience
but
driven
by
the
sense
of
danger
he
entered
the
chest
the
lady
locked
it
and
took
the
key
a
moment
afterwards
the
pasha
came
in
i
am
very
tired
he
said
bring
me
coffee
and
a
chibook
good
evening
pasha
effendi
said
the
lady
sit
down
i
have
something
to
tell
you
bah
said
the
pasha
i
want
none
of
your
woman

of

long
and
her
wits
are
short
says
the
proverb

pipe
but
pasha

said
the
lady
i
have
had
an
adventure
bah

the
pasha
what
adventure

a
woman
have
forgot
to
paint
your
eyebrows
or
color

nails
i
suppose

pasha
effendi

patient
and
i
will
tell

went
out
to

letter

the
pasha
to
whom
would
you
write
a
letter
be
patient
she
said
and
i
will
tell
you
my
story
so
i
came
to
the
box
of
a
young
scribe
with
beautiful
eyes
a
young
man
with
beautiful
eyes
shouted
the
pasha
where
is
he
i
kill
him
and
he
drew
his
sword
the
hodja
in
the
chest
heard
every
word
and
trembled
in
every
limb
be
patient
pasha
effendi
i
said
i
had
an
adventure
and
you
did
not
believe
me
i
told
the
young
man
that
the
letter
was
long
and
i
could
not
stand
in
the
street
to
write
it
so
i
asked
him
to
come
and
see
me
this
afternoon
here
to
this
house
thundered
the
pasha
yes
pasha
effendi
said
the
lady
so
the
hodja
came
here
and
i
gave
him
coffee
and
a
cigarette
and
we
talked
and
the
minutes
seemed
like
seconds
and
the
hours
were
as
minutes
all
at
once
came
your
knock
at
the
gate
and
i
said
to
the
hodja
is
the
pasha
and
if
he
finds
you
here
he
will
kill
you
and
i
will
kill
him
screamed
the
pasha
where
is
he
be
patient
pasha
effendi
said
the
lady
and
i
will
tell
you
when
you
knocked
a
second
time
i
suddenly
thought
of
the
chest
and
i
put
the
hodja
in
let
me
at
him
screamed
the
pasha
i
cut
off
his
head
o
pasha
she
said
what
a
hurry
you
are
in
to
slay
this
comely
youth
he
is
your
prey
he
can
not
escape
you
the
youth
is
not
only
in
the
box
but
it
is
locked
and
the
key
is
in
my
pocket
here
it
is
the
lady
walked
over
to
the
pasha
stretched
out
her
hand
and
gave
him
the
key
as
he
took
it
she
said
philopena
bah
said
the
pasha
in
disgust
he
threw
the
key
on
the
floor
and
left
the
harem
slamming
the
door
behind
him
after
he
had
gone
the
lady
took
up
the
key
unlocked
the
door
and
let
out
the
trembling
hodja
go
now
hodja
to
your
box
she
said
take
down
your
sign
and
write
instead
wit
of
woman
is
twofold
the
wit
of
man
for
i
am
a
woman
and
in
one
day
i
have
fooled
two
men
the
hanoum
and
the
unjust
cadi
it
was
and
still
is
in
some
parts
of
constantinople
the
custom
of
the
to
go
about
the
streets
with
a
basket
on
his
back
and
a
wooden
shovel
in
his
hand
calling
out
removed
a
certain
chepdji
plying
his
trade
had
in
the
course
of
five
years
of
assiduous
labor
amassed
to
him
the
no
unimportant
sum
of
five
hundred
piasters
he
was
afraid
to
keep
this
money
by
him
so
hearing
the
cadi
of
stamboul
highly
and
reverently
spoken
of
he
decided
to
entrust
his
savings
to
the
cadi
keeping
going
to
the
cadi
he
said
oh
learned
and
righteous
man
for
five
long
years
have
i
labored
carrying
the
dregs
and
dross
of
rich
and
poor
alike
and
i
have
saved
a
sum
of
five
hundred
piasters
with
the
help
of
allah
in
another
two
years
i
shall
have
saved
a
further
sum
of
at
least
one
hundred
piasters
when
inshallah
i
shall
return
to
my
country
and
clasp
my
wife
and
children
again
in
the
meantime
you
will
be
granting
a
boon
to
your
slave
if
you
will
consent
to
keep
this
money
for
me
until
the
time
for
departure
has
come
the
cadi
replied
thou
hast
done
well
my
son
the
money
will
be
kept
and
given
to
thee
when
required
the
poor
chepdji
well
satisfied
departed
but
after
a
very
short
time
he
learned
that
several
of
his
friends
were
about
to
return
to
their
memleket
province
and
he
decided
to
join
them
thinking
that
his
five
hundred
piasters
were
ample
for
the
time
being
said
he
knows
what
may
or
may
not
happen
in
the
next
two
years
so
he
decided
to
depart
with
his
friends
at
once
he
went
to
the
cadi
explained
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
that
he
was
going
to
leave
for
his
country
immediately
and
asked
for
his
money
the
cadi
called
him
a
dog
and
ordered
him
to
be
whipped
out
of
the
place
by
his
servants
alas
what
could
the
poor
chepdji
do
he
wept
in
impotent
despair
as
he
counted
the
number
of
years
he
must
yet
work
before
beholding
his
loved
ones
one
day
while
moving
the
dirt
from
the
konak
of
a
wealthy
pasha
his
soul
uttered
a
sigh
which
reached
the
ears
of
the
hanoum
and
from
the
window
she
asked
him
why
he
sighed
so
deeply
he
replied
that
he
sighed
for
something
that
could
in
no
way
interest
her
the
sympathy
was
excited
and
after
much
persuasion
he
finally
with
tears
in
his
eyes
related
to
her
his
great
misfortune
the
hanoum
thought
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
told
him
to
go
the
following
day
to
the
cadi
at
a
certain
hour
and
again
ask
for
the
money
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
hanoum
in
the
meantime
gathered
together
a
quantity
of
jewelry
to
the
value
of
several
hundred
pounds
and
instructed
her
favorite
and
confidential
slave
to
come
with
her
to
the
cadi
and
remain
outside
whilst
she
went
in
directing
her
that
when
she
saw
the
chepdji
come
out
and
learned
that
he
had
gotten
his
money
to
come
in
the
room
hurriedly
and
say
to
her
your
husband
has
arrived
from
egypt
and
is
waiting
for
you
at
the
konak
the
hanoum
then
went
to
the
cadi
carrying
in
her
hand
a
bag
containing
the
jewelry
with
a
profound
salaam
she
said
oh
cadi
my
husband
who
is
in
egypt
and
who
has
been
there
for
several
years
has
at
last
asked
me
to
come
and
join
him
there
these
jewels
are
of
great
value
and
i
hesitate
to
take
them
with
me
on
so
long
and
dangerous
a
journey
if
you
would
kindly
consent
to
keep
them
for
me
until
my
return
or
if
i
never
return
to
keep
them
as
a
token
of
my
esteem
i
will
think
of
you
with
lifelong
gratitude
the
hanoum
then
began
displaying
the
rich
jewelry
just
then
the
chepdji
entered
and
bending
low
said
oh
master
your
slave
has
come
for
his
savings
in
order
to
proceed
to
his
country
ah
welcome
said
the
cadi
so
you
are
going
already
and
immediately
ordered
the
treasurer
to
pay
the
five
hundred
piasters
to
the
chepdji
you
see
said
the
cadi
to
the
hanoum
what
confidence
the
people
have
in
me
this
money
i
have
held
for
some
time
without
receipt
or
acknowledgment
but
directly
it
is
asked
for
it
is
paid
no
sooner
had
the
chepdji
gone
out
of
the
door
than
the
slave
came
rushing
in
crying
hanoum
effendi
hanoum
effendi
your
husband
has
arrived
from
egypt
and
is
anxiously
awaiting
you
at
the
konak
the
hanoum
in
excitement
gathered
up
her
jewelry
and
wishing
the
cadi
a
thousand
years
of
happiness
departed
the
cadi
was
thunderstruck
and
caressing
his
beard
with
grave
affection
thoughtfully
said
allah
allah
for
forty
years
have
i
been
judge
but
never
was
a
cause
pleaded
in
this
fashion
before
what
happened
to
hadji
a
merchant
of
the
bezestan
hadji
was
a
married
man
but
even
turkish
married
men
are
not
invulnerable
to
the
charms
of
other
women
it
happened
one
day
when
possibly
the
engrossing
power
of
his
lawful
wife
influence
was
feeble
upon
him
that
a
charming
hanoum
came
to
his
shop
to
purchase
some
spices
after
the
departure
of
his
fair
visitor
hadji
do
what
he
might
could
not
drive
from
his
mind
eye
either
her
image
or
her
attractive
power
he
was
further
greatly
puzzled
by
a
tiny
black
bag
containing
twelve
grains
of
wheat
which
the
hanoum
had
evidently
forgotten
till
a
late
hour
that
night
did
hadji
remain
in
his
shop
in
the
hope
that
either
the
hanoum
or
one
of
her
servants
would
come
for
the
bag
and
thus
give
him
the
means
of
seeing
her
again
or
at
least
of
learning
where
she
lived
but
hadji
was
doomed
to
disappointment
and
much
preoccupied
he
returned
to
his
home
there
he
sat
unresponsive
to
his
wife
conversation
thinking
and
no
doubt
making
mental
comparisons
between
her
and
his
visitor
hadji
remained
downcast
day
after
day
and
at
last
giving
way
to
his
wife
entreaties
to
share
his
troubles
he
frankly
told
her
what
had
happened
and
that
ever
since
that
day
his
soul
was
in
his
bondage
oh
husband
replied
his
wife
and
do
you
not
understand
what
that
black
bag
containing
the
twelve
grains
of
wheat
means
alas
no
replied
hadji
why
my
husband
it
is
plain
plain
as
if
it
had
been
told
she
lives
in
the
wheat
market
at
house
no
with
a
black
door
much
excited
hadji
rushed
off
and
found
that
there
was
a
no
in
the
wheat
market
with
a
black
door
so
he
promptly
knocked
the
door
opened
and
who
should
he
behold
but
the
lady
in
question
she
however
instead
of
speaking
to
him
threw
a
basin
of
water
out
into
the
street
and
then
shut
the
door
hadji
with
mingled
feelings
of
gratitude
to
his
wife
for
having
so
accurately
directed
him
but
none
the
less
surprised
at
his
reception
lingered
about
the
doorway
for
a
time
and
then
returned
home
he
greeted
his
wife
more
pleasantly
than
he
had
for
many
days
and
told
her
of
his
strange
reception
why
said
his
wife
do
you
understand
what
the
basin
of
water
thrown
out
of
the
door
means
alas
no
said
hadji
veyh
veyh
an
exclamation
of
pity
it
means
that
at
the
back
of
the
house
there
is
a
running
stream
and
that
you
must
go
to
her
that
way
off
rushed
hadji
and
found
that
his
wife
was
right
there
was
a
running
stream
at
the
back
of
the
house
so
he
knocked
at
the
back
door
the
hanoum
however
instead
of
opening
it
came
to
the
window
showed
a
mirror
reversed
it
and
then
disappeared
hadji
lingered
at
the
back
of
the
house
for
a
long
time
but
seeing
no
further
sign
of
life
he
returned
to
his
home
much
dejected
on
entering
the
house
his
wife
greeted
him
with
well
was
it
not
as
i
told
you
yes
said
hadji
you
are
truly
a
wonderful
woman
mashallah
but
i
do
not
know
why
she
came
to
the
window
and
showed
me
a
mirror
both
in
front
and
back
instead
of
opening
the
door
oh
said
his
wife
that
is
very
simple
she
means
that
you
must
go
when
the
face
of
the
moon
has
reversed
itself
about
ten
the
hour
arrived
hadji
hurried
off
and
so
did
his
wife
the
one
to
see
his
love
and
the
other
to
inform
the
police
whilst
hadji
and
his
charmer
were
talking
in
the
garden
the
police
seized
them
and
carried
them
both
off
to
prison
and
hadji
wife
having
accomplished
her
mission
returned
home
the
next
morning
she
baked
a
quantity
of
lokum
cakes
and
taking
them
to
the
prison
begged
entrance
of
the
guards
and
permission
to
distribute
these
cakes
to
the
prisoners
for
the
repose
of
the
souls
of
her
dead
this
being
a
request
which
could
not
be
denied
she
was
allowed
to
enter
finding
the
cell
in
which
the
lady
who
had
infatuated
her
husband
was
confined
she
offered
to
save
her
the
disgrace
of
the
exposure
provided
she
would
consent
never
again
to
look
upon
hadji
the
merchant
with
envious
or
loving
eyes
the
conditions
were
gratefully
accepted
and
hadji
wife
changed
places
with
the
prisoner
when
they
were
brought
before
the
judge
hadji
was
thunderstruck
to
see
his
wife
but
being
a
wise
man
he
held
his
peace
and
left
her
to
do
the
talking
which
she
did
most
vigorously
vehemently
protesting
against
the
insult
inflicted
on
both
her
and
her
husband
in
bringing
them
to
prison
because
they
chose
to
converse
in
a
garden
being
lawfully
wedded
people
in
witness
whereof
she
called
upon
the
bekdji
watchman
and
the
imam
priest
of
the
district
and
several
of
her
neighbors
poor
hadji
was
dumfounded
and
accompanied
by
his
better
half
left
the
prison
where
he
had
expected
to
stay
at
least
a
year
or
two
saying
truly
thou
art
a
wonderful
woman
mashallah
how
the
junkman
travelled
to
find
treasure
in
his
own
yard
in
one
of
the
towers
overlooking
the
sea
of
marmora
and
skirting
the
ancient
city
of
stamboul
there
lived
an
old
junkman
who
earned
a
precarious
livelihood
in
gathering
cinders
and
useless
pieces
of
iron
and
selling
them
to
smiths
often
did
he
moralize
on
the
sad
kismet
that
had
reduced
him
to
the
task
of
daily
laboring
for
his
bread
to
make
a
shoe
perhaps
for
an
ass
surely
he
a
true
mussulman
might
at
least
be
permitted
to
ride
the
ass
his
eternal
longing
often
found
satisfaction
in
passing
his
hours
of
sleep
in
dreams
of
wealth
and
luxury
but
with
the
dawning
of
the
day
came
reality
and
increased
longing
often
did
he
call
on
the
spirit
of
sleep
to
reverse
matters
but
in
vain
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
began
the
gathering
of
the
cinders
and
iron
one
night
he
dreamt
that
he
begged
this
nocturnal
visitor
to
change
his
night
to
day
and
the
spirit
said
to
him
go
to
egypt
and
it
shall
be
so
this
encouraging
phrase
haunted
him
by
day
and
inspired
him
by
night
so
persecuted
was
he
with
the
thought
that
when
his
wife
said
to
him
from
the
door
have
you
brought
home
any
bread
he
would
reply
no
i
have
not
gone
i
will
go
thinking
she
had
asked
him
have
you
gone
to
egypt
at
last
when
friends
and
neighbors
began
to
pity
poor
ahmet
for
that
was
his
name
as
a
man
on
whom
the
hand
of
allah
was
heavily
laid
removing
his
intelligence
he
one
morning
left
his
house
saying
i
go
i
go
to
the
land
of
wealth
and
he
left
his
wife
wringing
her
hands
in
despair
while
the
neighbors
tried
to
comfort
her
poor
ahmet
went
straight
on
board
a
boat
which
he
had
been
told
was
bound
for
iskender
alexandria
and
assured
the
captain
that
he
was
summoned
thither
and
that
he
was
bound
to
take
him
and
mad
persons
being
more
holy
than
others
ahmet
was
conveyed
to
iskender
arriving
in
iskender
hadji
ahmet
roamed
far
and
wide
proceeding
as
far
as
cairo
in
search
of
the
luxuries
he
had
enjoyed
at
constantinople
when
in
the
land
of
morpheus
which
he
had
been
promised
to
enjoy
in
the
sunshine
if
he
came
to
egypt
alas
for
hadji
ahmet
the
only
bread
he
had
to
eat
was
that
which
was
given
him
by
sympathizing
humanity
time
sped
on
sympathy
was
growing
tired
of
expending
itself
on
hadji
ahmet
and
his
crusts
of
bread
were
few
and
far
between
wearied
of
life
and
suffering
he
decided
to
ask
allah
to
let
him
die
and
wandering
out
to
the
pyramids
he
solicited
the
stones
to
have
pity
and
fall
on
him
it
happened
that
a
turk
heard
this
prayer
and
said
to
him
why
so
miserable
father
has
your
soul
been
so
strangled
that
you
prefer
its
being
dashed
out
of
your
body
to
its
remaining
the
prescribed
time
in
bondage
yes
my
son
said
hadji
ahmet
far
away
in
stamboul
with
the
help
of
god
i
managed
as
a
junkman
to
feed
my
wife
and
myself
but
here
am
i
in
egypt
a
stranger
alone
and
starving
with
possibly
my
wife
already
dead
of
starvation
and
all
this
through
a
dream
alas
alas
my
father
that
you
at
your
age
should
be
tempted
to
wander
so
far
from
home
and
friends
because
of
a
dream
why
were
i
to
obey
my
dreams
i
would
at
this
present
moment
be
in
stamboul
digging
for
a
treasure
that
lies
buried
under
a
tree
i
can
even
now
although
i
have
never
been
there
describe
where
it
is
in
my
eye
i
see
a
wall
a
great
wall
that
must
have
been
built
many
years
ago
and
supporting
or
seeming
to
support
this
wall
are
towers
with
many
corners
towers
that
are
round
towers
that
are
square
and
others
that
have
smaller
towers
within
them
in
one
of
these
towers
a
square
one
there
live
an
old
man
and
woman
and
close
by
the
tower
is
a
large
tree
and
every
night
when
i
dream
of
the
place
the
old
man
tells
me
to
dig
and
disclose
the
treasure
but
father
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
go
to
stamboul
and
seek
to
verify
this
it
is
an
dream
and
nothing
more
see
what
you
have
been
reduced
to
by
coming
so
far
yes
said
hadji
ahmet
it
is
a
dream
and
nothing
more
but
you
have
interpreted
it
allah
be
praised
you
have
encouraged
me
i
will
return
to
my
home
and
hadji
ahmet
and
the
young
stranger
parted
the
one
grateful
that
it
had
pleased
allah
to
give
him
the
power
to
revive
and
encourage
a
drooping
spirit
and
the
other
grateful
to
allah
that
when
he
had
despaired
of
life
a
stranger
should
come
and
give
him
the
interpretation
of
his
dream
he
certainly
had
wandered
far
and
long
to
learn
that
the
treasure
was
in
his
own
garden
hadji
ahmet
in
due
course
much
to
the
astonishment
of
both
wife
and
neighbors
again
appeared
upon
the
scene
not
a
much
changed
man
in
fact
he
was
the
cinder
and
iron
gatherer
of
old
to
all
questions
as
to
where
he
was
and
what
he
had
been
doing
he
would
answer
a
dream
sent
me
away
and
a
dream
brought
me
back
and
the
neighbors
would
say
truly
he
must
be
blessed
one
night
hadji
ahmet
went
to
the
tree
provided
with
spade
and
pick
that
he
had
secured
from
an
obliging
neighbor
after
digging
a
short
time
a
heavy
case
was
brought
to
view
in
which
he
found
gold
silver
and
precious
jewels
of
great
value
hadji
ahmet
replaced
the
case
and
earth
and
returned
to
bed
much
lamenting
that
it
had
pleased
god
to
furnish
women
more
especially
his
wife
with
a
long
tongue
long
hair
and
very
short
wits
alas
he
thought
if
i
tell
my
wife
i
may
be
hung
as
a
robber
for
it
is
against
the
laws
of
nature
for
a
woman
to
keep
a
secret
yet
becoming
more
generous
when
thinking
of
the
years
of
toil
and
hardship
she
had
shared
with
him
he
decided
to
try
and
see
if
by
chance
his
wife
was
not
an
exception
to
other
women
who
knows
she
might
keep
the
secret
to
test
her
at
no
risk
to
himself
and
the
treasure
he
conceived
a
plan
crawling
from
his
bed
he
sallied
forth
and
bought
found
or
stole
an
egg
this
egg
on
the
following
morning
he
showed
to
his
wife
and
said
to
her
alas
i
fear
i
am
not
as
other
men
for
evidently
in
the
night
i
laid
this
egg
and
wife
mine
if
the
neighbors
hear
of
this
your
husband
the
hadji
ahmet
will
be
bastinadoed
bowstrung
and
burned
to
death
ah
truly
my
soul
is
strangled
and
without
another
word
hadji
ahmet
with
a
sack
on
his
shoulder
went
forth
to
gather
the
shoes
of
horse
ox
or
ass
wondering
if
his
wife
would
prove
an
exception
in
this
as
she
had
in
many
other
ways
to
other
women
in
the
evening
he
returned
heavily
laden
with
his
finds
and
as
he
neared
home
he
heard
rumors
ominous
rumors
that
a
certain
hadji
ahmet
who
had
been
considered
a
holy
man
had
done
something
that
was
unknown
in
the
history
of
man
even
in
the
history
of
hens
that
he
had
laid
a
dozen
eggs
needless
to
add
that
hadji
ahmet
did
not
tell
his
wife
of
the
treasure
but
daily
went
forth
with
his
sack
to
gather
iron
and
cinders
and
invariably
found
when
separating
his
finds
of
the
day
in
company
with
his
wife
at
first
one
and
then
more
gold
and
silver
pieces
and
now
and
then
a
precious
stone
how
chapkin
halid
became
chief
detective
in
balata
there
lived
some
years
ago
two
scapegraces
called
chapkin
halid
and
pitch
osman
these
two
young
rascals
lived
by
their
wits
and
at
the
expense
of
their
neighbors
but
they
often
had
to
lament
the
difficulties
they
encountered
in
procuring
the
few
piasters
they
needed
daily
for
bread
and
the
tavern
they
had
tried
several
schemes
in
their
own
neighborhood
with
exceptionally
poor
results
and
were
almost
disheartened
when
chapkin
halid
conceived
an
idea
that
seemed
to
offer
every
chance
of
success
he
explained
to
his
chum
osman
that
balata
was
played
out
at
least
for
a
time
and
that
they
must
go
elsewhere
to
satisfy
their
needs
halid
plan
was
to
go
to
stamboul
and
feign
death
in
the
principal
street
while
osman
was
to
collect
the
funeral
expenses
of
his
friend
halid
arriving
in
stamboul
halid
stretched
himself
on
his
back
on
the
pavement
and
covered
his
face
with
an
old
sack
while
osman
sat
himself
down
beside
the
supposed
corpse
and
every
now
and
then
bewailed
the
hard
fate
of
the
stranger
who
had
met
with
death
on
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
the
corpse
prompted
osman
whenever
the
coast
was
clear
and
the
touching
tale
told
by
osman
soon
brought
contributions
for
the
burial
of
the
stranger
osman
had
collected
about
thirty
piasters
and
halid
was
seriously
thinking
of
a
resurrection
but
was
prevented
by
the
passing
of
the
grand
vizier
who
upon
inquiring
why
the
man
lay
on
the
ground
in
that
fashion
was
told
that
he
was
a
stranger
who
had
died
in
the
street
the
grand
vizier
thereupon
gave
instructions
to
an
imam
who
happened
to
be
at
hand
to
bury
the
stranger
and
come
for
the
money
to
the
sublime
porte
halid
was
reverently
carried
off
to
the
mosque
and
osman
thought
that
it
was
time
to
leave
the
corpse
to
take
care
of
itself
the
imam
laid
halid
on
the
marble
floor
and
prepared
to
wash
him
prior
to
interment
he
had
taken
off
his
turban
and
long
cloak
and
got
ready
the
water
when
he
remembered
that
he
had
no
soap
and
immediately
went
out
to
purchase
some
no
sooner
had
the
imam
disappeared
than
halid
jumped
up
and
donning
the
imam
turban
and
long
cloak
repaired
to
the
sublime
porte
here
he
asked
admittance
to
the
grand
vizier
but
this
request
was
not
granted
until
he
told
the
nature
of
his
business
halid
said
he
was
the
imam
who
in
compliance
with
the
verbal
instructions
received
from
his
highness
had
buried
a
stranger
and
that
he
had
come
for
payment
the
grand
vizier
sent
five
gold
pieces
twenty
piasters
each
to
the
supposed
imam
and
halid
made
off
as
fast
as
possible
no
sooner
had
halid
departed
than
the
cloakless
imam
arrived
in
breathless
haste
and
explained
that
he
was
the
imam
who
had
received
instructions
from
the
grand
vizier
to
bury
a
stranger
but
that
the
supposed
corpse
had
disappeared
and
so
had
his
cloak
and
turban
witnesses
proved
this
man
to
be
the
imam
of
the
quarter
and
the
grand
vizier
gave
orders
to
his
chief
detective
to
capture
within
three
days
on
pain
of
death
and
bring
to
the
sublime
porte
this
fearless
the
chief
detective
was
soon
on
the
track
of
halid
but
the
latter
was
on
the
keen
lookout
with
the
aid
of
the
money
he
had
received
from
the
grand
vizier
to
defray
his
burial
expenses
he
successfully
evaded
the
clutches
of
the
chief
detective
who
was
greatly
put
about
at
being
thus
frustrated
on
the
second
day
he
again
got
scent
of
halid
and
determined
to
follow
him
till
an
opportunity
offered
for
his
capture
halid
knew
that
he
was
followed
and
divined
the
intentions
of
his
pursuer
as
he
was
passing
a
pharmacy
he
noticed
there
several
young
men
so
he
entered
and
explained
in
one
of
his
accomplishments
to
the
jew
druggist
as
he
handed
him
one
of
the
gold
pieces
he
had
received
from
the
grand
vizier
that
his
uncle
who
would
come
in
presently
was
not
right
in
his
mind
but
that
if
the
druggist
could
manage
to
douche
his
head
and
back
with
cold
water
he
would
be
all
right
for
a
week
or
two
no
sooner
did
the
chief
detective
enter
the
shop
than
at
a
word
from
the
apothecary
the
young
men
seized
him
and
by
means
of
a
large
squirt
they
did
their
utmost
to
effectively
give
him
the
salutary
and
cooling
douche
the
more
the
detective
protested
the
more
the
apothecary
consolingly
explained
that
the
operation
would
soon
be
over
and
that
he
would
feel
much
better
and
told
of
the
numerous
similar
cases
he
had
cured
in
a
like
manner
the
detective
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
struggle
so
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
treatment
and
in
the
meantime
halid
made
off
the
chief
detective
was
so
disheartened
that
he
went
to
the
grand
vizier
and
asked
him
to
behead
him
as
death
was
preferable
to
the
annoyance
he
had
received
and
might
still
receive
at
the
hands
of
chapkin
halid
the
grand
vizier
was
both
furious
and
amused
so
he
spared
the
chief
detective
and
gave
orders
that
guards
be
placed
at
the
gates
of
the
city
and
that
halid
be
seized
at
the
first
opportunity
a
reward
was
further
promised
to
the
person
who
would
bring
him
to
the
sublime
porte
halid
was
finally
caught
one
night
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
cannon
gate
and
the
guards
rejoicing
in
their
capture
after
considerable
consultation
decided
to
bind
halid
to
a
large
tree
close
to
the
guard
house
and
thus
both
avoid
the
loss
of
sleep
and
the
anxiety
incident
to
watching
over
so
desperate
a
character
this
was
done
and
halid
now
thought
that
his
case
was
hopeless
towards
dawn
halid
perceived
a
man
with
a
lantern
walking
toward
the
armenian
church
and
rightly
concluded
that
it
was
the
beadle
going
to
make
ready
for
the
early
morning
service
so
he
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
beadle
brother
beadle
brother
come
here
quickly
now
it
happened
that
the
beadle
was
a
poor
hunchback
and
no
sooner
did
halid
perceive
this
than
he
said
quick
quick
beadle
look
at
my
back
and
see
if
it
has
gone
see
if
what
has
gone
asked
the
beadle
carefully
looking
behind
the
tree
why
my
hump
of
course
answered
halid
the
beadle
made
a
close
inspection
and
declared
that
he
could
see
no
hump
a
thousand
thanks
fervently
exclaimed
halid
then
please
undo
the
rope
the
beadle
set
about
to
liberate
halid
and
at
the
same
time
earnestly
begged
to
be
told
how
he
had
got
rid
of
the
hump
so
that
he
also
might
free
himself
of
his
deformity
halid
agreed
to
tell
him
the
cure
provided
the
beadle
had
not
yet
broken
fast
and
also
that
he
was
prepared
to
pay
a
certain
small
sum
of
money
for
the
secret
the
beadle
satisfied
halid
on
both
of
these
points
and
the
latter
immediately
set
about
binding
the
hunchback
to
the
tree
and
further
told
him
on
pain
of
breaking
the
spell
to
repeat
times
the
words
pesserti
sersepeti
if
he
did
this
the
hump
would
of
a
certainty
disappear
halid
left
the
poor
beadle
religiously
and
earnestly
repeating
the
words
the
guards
were
furious
when
they
found
bound
to
the
tree
a
madman
as
they
thought
repeating
incoherent
words
instead
of
halid
they
began
to
unbind
the
captive
but
the
only
answer
they
could
get
to
their
host
of
questions
was
pesserti
sersepeti
as
the
knots
were
loosened
the
louder
did
the
beadle
in
despair
call
out
the
charmed
words
in
the
hopes
of
arresting
them
no
sooner
was
the
beadle
freed
than
he
asked
god
to
bring
down
calamity
on
the
destroyers
of
the
charm
that
was
to
remove
his
hunch
on
hearing
the
beadle
tale
the
guards
understood
how
their
prisoner
had
secured
his
liberty
and
sent
word
to
the
chief
detective
this
gentleman
told
the
grand
vizier
of
the
cunning
of
the
escaped
prisoner
the
grand
vizier
was
amused
and
also
very
anxious
to
see
this
chapkin
halid
so
he
sent
criers
all
over
the
city
giving
full
pardon
to
halid
on
condition
that
he
would
come
to
the
sublime
porte
and
confess
in
person
to
the
grand
vizier
halid
obeyed
the
summons
and
came
to
kiss
the
hem
of
the
grand
vizier
garment
who
was
so
favorably
impressed
by
him
that
he
then
and
there
appointed
him
to
be
his
chief
detective
how
cobbler
ahmet
became
the
chief
astrologer
every
day
cobbler
ahmet
year
in
and
year
out
measured
the
breadth
of
his
tiny
cabin
with
his
arms
as
he
stitched
old
shoes
to
do
this
was
his
kismet
his
decreed
fate
and
he
was
content
and
why
not
his
business
brought
him
quite
sufficient
to
provide
the
necessaries
of
life
for
both
himself
and
his
wife
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
coincidence
that
occurred
in
all
probability
he
would
have
mended
old
boots
and
shoes
to
the
end
of
his
days
one
day
cobbler
ahmet
wife
went
to
the
hamam
bath
and
while
there
she
was
much
annoyed
at
being
obliged
to
give
up
her
compartment
owing
to
the
arrival
of
the
harem
and
retinue
of
the
chief
astrologer
to
the
sultan
much
hurt
she
returned
home
and
vented
her
pique
upon
her
innocent
husband
why
are
you
not
the
chief
astrologer
to
the
sultan
she
said
i
will
never
call
or
think
of
you
as
my
husband
until
you
have
been
appointed
chief
astrologer
to
his
majesty
ahmet
thought
that
this
was
another
phase
in
the
eccentricity
of
woman
which
in
all
probability
would
disappear
before
morning
so
he
took
small
notice
of
what
his
wife
said
but
ahmet
was
wrong
his
wife
persisted
so
much
in
his
giving
up
his
present
means
of
earning
a
livelihood
and
becoming
an
astrologer
that
finally
for
the
sake
of
peace
he
complied
with
her
desire
he
sold
his
tools
and
collection
of
sundry
old
boots
and
shoes
and
with
the
proceeds
purchased
an
inkwell
and
reeds
but
this
alas
did
not
constitute
him
an
astrologer
and
he
explained
to
his
wife
that
this
mad
idea
of
hers
would
bring
him
to
an
unhappy
end
she
however
could
not
be
moved
and
insisted
on
his
going
to
the
highway
there
to
wisely
practise
the
art
and
thus
ultimately
become
the
chief
astrologer
in
obedience
to
his
wife
instructions
ahmet
sat
down
on
the
highroad
and
his
oppressed
spirit
sought
comfort
in
looking
at
the
heavens
and
sighing
deeply
while
in
this
condition
a
hanoum
in
great
excitement
came
and
asked
him
if
he
communicated
with
the
stars
poor
ahmet
sighed
saying
that
he
was
compelled
to
converse
with
them
then
please
tell
me
where
my
diamond
ring
is
and
i
will
both
bless
and
handsomely
reward
you
the
hanoum
with
this
immediately
squatted
on
the
ground
and
began
to
tell
ahmet
that
she
had
gone
to
the
bath
that
morning
and
that
she
was
positive
that
she
then
had
the
ring
but
every
corner
of
the
hamam
had
been
searched
and
the
ring
was
not
to
be
found
oh
astrologer
for
the
love
of
allah
exert
your
eye
to
see
the
unseen
hanoum
effendi
replied
ahmet
the
instant
her
excited
flow
of
language
had
ceased
i
perceive
a
rent
referring
to
a
tear
he
had
noticed
in
her
shalvars
or
baggy
trousers
up
jumped
the
hanoum
exclaiming
a
thousand
holy
thanks
you
are
right
now
i
remember
i
put
the
ring
in
a
crevice
of
the
cold
water
fountain
and
in
her
gratitude
she
handed
ahmet
several
gold
pieces
in
the
evening
he
returned
to
his
home
and
giving
the
gold
to
his
wife
said
take
this
money
wife
may
it
satisfy
you
and
in
return
all
i
ask
is
that
you
allow
me
to
go
back
to
the
trade
of
my
father
and
not
expose
me
to
the
danger
and
suffering
of
trudging
the
road
shoeless
but
her
purpose
was
unmoved
until
he
became
the
chief
astrologer
she
would
neither
call
him
nor
think
of
him
as
her
husband
in
the
meantime
owing
to
the
discovery
of
the
ring
the
fame
of
ahmet
the
cobbler
spread
far
and
wide
the
tongue
of
the
hanoum
never
ceased
to
sound
his
praise
it
happened
that
the
wife
of
a
certain
pasha
had
appropriated
a
valuable
diamond
necklace
and
as
a
last
resource
the
pasha
determined
seeing
that
all
the
astrologers
hodjas
and
diviners
had
failed
to
discover
the
article
to
consult
ahmet
the
cobbler
whose
praises
were
in
every
mouth
the
pasha
went
to
ahmet
and
in
fear
and
trembling
the
wife
who
had
appropriated
the
necklace
sent
her
confidential
slave
to
overhear
what
the
astrologer
would
say
the
pasha
told
ahmet
all
he
knew
about
the
necklace
but
this
gave
no
clue
and
in
despair
he
asked
how
many
diamonds
the
necklace
contained
on
being
told
that
there
were
ahmet
to
put
off
the
evil
hour
said
it
would
take
an
hour
to
discover
each
diamond
consequently
would
the
pasha
come
on
the
morrow
at
the
same
hour
when
inshallah
he
would
perhaps
be
able
to
give
him
some
news
the
pasha
departed
and
no
sooner
was
he
out
of
earshot
than
the
troubled
ahmet
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
oh
woman
oh
woman
what
evil
influence
impelled
you
to
go
the
wrong
path
and
drag
others
with
you
when
the
hours
are
up
you
will
perhaps
repent
alas
too
late
your
husband
gone
from
you
forever
without
a
hope
even
of
being
united
in
paradise
ahmet
was
referring
to
himself
and
his
wife
for
he
fully
expected
to
be
cast
into
prison
on
the
following
day
as
an
impostor
but
the
slave
who
had
been
listening
gave
another
interpretation
to
his
words
and
hurrying
off
told
her
mistress
that
the
astrologer
knew
all
about
the
theft
the
good
man
had
even
bewailed
the
separation
that
would
inevitably
take
place
the
pasha
wife
was
distracted
and
hurried
off
to
plead
her
cause
in
person
with
the
astrologer
on
approaching
ahmet
the
first
words
she
said
in
her
excitement
were
oh
learned
hodja
you
are
a
great
and
good
man
have
compassion
on
my
weakness
and
do
not
expose
me
to
the
wrath
of
my
husband
i
will
do
such
penance
as
you
may
order
and
bless
you
five
times
daily
as
long
as
i
live
how
can
i
save
you
innocently
asked
ahmet
what
is
decreed
is
decreed
and
then
though
silent
looked
volumes
for
he
instinctively
knew
that
words
unuttered
were
arrows
still
in
the
quiver
if
you
wo
pity
me
continued
the
hanoum
in
despair
i
will
go
and
confess
to
my
pasha
and
perhaps
he
will
forgive
me
to
this
appeal
ahmet
said
he
must
ask
the
stars
for
their
views
on
the
subject
the
hanoum
inquired
if
the
answer
would
come
before
the
hours
were
up
ahmet
reply
to
this
was
a
long
and
concentrated
gaze
at
the
heavens
oh
hodja
effendi
i
must
go
now
or
the
pasha
will
miss
me
shall
i
give
you
the
necklace
to
restore
to
the
pasha
without
explanation
when
he
comes
for
the
answer
ahmet
now
realized
what
all
the
trouble
was
about
and
in
consideration
of
a
fee
he
promised
not
to
reveal
her
theft
on
the
condition
that
she
would
at
once
return
home
and
place
the
necklace
between
the
mattresses
of
her
pasha
bed
this
the
grateful
woman
agreed
to
do
and
departed
invoking
blessings
on
ahmet
who
in
return
promised
to
exercise
his
influence
in
her
behalf
for
astral
intervention
when
the
pasha
came
to
the
astrologer
at
the
appointed
time
he
explained
to
him
that
if
he
wanted
both
the
necklace
and
the
thief
or
thieves
it
would
take
a
long
time
as
it
was
impossible
to
hurry
the
stars
but
if
he
would
be
content
with
the
necklace
alone
the
horoscope
indicated
that
the
stars
would
oblige
him
at
once
the
pasha
said
that
he
would
be
quite
satisfied
if
he
could
get
his
diamonds
again
and
ahmet
at
once
told
him
where
to
find
them
the
pasha
returned
to
his
home
not
a
little
sceptical
and
immediately
searched
for
the
necklace
where
ahmet
had
told
him
it
was
to
be
found
his
joy
and
astonishment
on
discovering
the
article
knew
no
bounds
and
the
fame
of
ahmet
the
cobbler
was
the
theme
of
every
tongue
having
received
handsome
payment
from
both
the
pasha
and
the
hanoum
ahmet
earnestly
begged
of
his
wife
to
desist
and
not
bring
down
sorrow
and
calamity
upon
his
head
but
his
pleadings
were
in
vain
satan
had
closed
his
wife
ear
to
reason
with
envy
resigned
to
his
fate
all
he
could
do
was
to
consult
the
stars
and
after
mature
thought
give
their
communication
or
assert
that
the
stars
had
for
some
reason
best
known
to
the
applicant
refused
to
commune
on
the
subject
it
happened
that
forty
cases
of
gold
were
stolen
from
the
imperial
treasury
and
every
astrologer
having
failed
to
get
even
a
clue
as
to
where
the
money
was
or
how
it
had
disappeared
ahmet
was
approached
poor
man
his
case
now
looked
hopeless
even
the
chief
astrologer
was
in
disgrace
what
might
be
his
punishment
he
did
not
know
most
probably
death
ahmet
had
no
idea
of
the
numerical
importance
of
forty
but
concluding
that
it
must
be
large
he
asked
for
a
delay
of
forty
days
to
discover
the
forty
cases
of
gold
ahmet
gathered
up
the
implements
of
his
occult
art
and
before
returning
to
his
home
went
to
a
shop
and
asked
for
forty
beans
neither
one
more
nor
one
less
when
he
got
home
and
laid
them
down
before
him
he
appreciated
the
number
of
cases
of
gold
that
had
been
stolen
and
also
the
number
of
days
he
had
to
live
he
knew
it
would
be
useless
to
explain
to
his
wife
the
seriousness
of
the
case
so
that
evening
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
forty
beans
and
mournfully
said
forty
cases
of
gold
forty
thieves
forty
days
and
here
is
one
of
them
handing
a
bean
to
his
wife
the
rest
remain
in
their
place
until
the
time
comes
to
give
them
up
while
ahmet
was
saying
this
to
his
wife
one
of
the
thieves
was
listening
at
the
window
the
thief
was
sure
he
had
been
discovered
when
he
heard
ahmet
say
and
here
is
one
of
them
and
hurried
off
to
tell
his
companions
the
thieves
were
greatly
distressed
but
decided
to
wait
till
the
next
evening
and
see
what
would
happen
then
and
another
of
the
number
was
sent
to
listen
and
see
if
the
report
would
be
verified
the
listener
had
not
long
been
stationed
at
his
post
when
he
heard
ahmet
say
to
his
wife
and
here
is
another
of
them
meaning
another
of
the
forty
days
of
his
life
but
the
thief
understood
the
words
otherwise
and
hurried
off
to
tell
his
chief
that
the
astrologer
knew
all
about
it
and
knew
that
he
had
been
there
the
thieves
consequently
decided
to
send
a
delegation
to
ahmet
confessing
their
guilt
and
offering
to
return
the
forty
cases
of
gold
intact
ahmet
received
them
and
on
hearing
their
confession
accompanied
with
their
condition
to
return
the
gold
boldly
told
them
that
he
did
not
require
their
aid
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
take
possession
of
the
forty
cases
of
gold
whenever
he
wished
but
that
he
had
no
special
desire
to
see
them
all
executed
and
he
would
plead
their
cause
if
they
would
go
and
put
the
gold
in
a
place
he
indicated
this
was
agreed
to
and
ahmet
continued
to
give
his
wife
a
bean
daily
but
now
with
another
purpose
he
no
longer
feared
the
loss
of
his
head
but
discounted
by
degrees
the
great
reward
he
hoped
to
receive
at
last
the
final
bean
was
given
to
his
wife
and
ahmet
was
summoned
to
the
palace
he
went
and
explained
to
his
majesty
that
the
stars
refused
both
to
reveal
the
thieves
and
the
gold
but
whichever
of
the
two
his
majesty
wished
would
be
immediately
granted
the
treasury
being
low
it
was
decided
that
provided
the
cases
were
returned
with
the
gold
intact
his
majesty
would
be
satisfied
ahmet
conducted
them
to
the
place
where
the
gold
was
buried
and
amidst
great
rejoicing
it
was
taken
back
to
the
palace
the
sultan
was
so
pleased
with
ahmet
that
he
appointed
him
to
the
office
of
chief
astrologer
and
his
wife
attained
her
desire
the
sultan
was
one
day
walking
in
his
palace
grounds
accompanied
by
his
chief
astrologer
wishing
to
test
his
powers
he
caught
a
grasshopper
and
holding
his
closed
hand
out
to
the
astrologer
asked
him
what
it
contained
ahmet
in
a
pained
and
reproachful
tone
answered
the
sultan
by
a
proverb
alas
your
majesty
the
grasshopper
never
knows
where
its
third
leap
will
land
it
figuratively
alluding
to
himself
and
the
dangerous
hazard
of
guessing
what
was
in
the
clenched
hand
of
his
majesty
the
sultan
was
so
struck
by
the
reply
that
ahmet
was
never
again
troubled
to
demonstrate
his
powers
the
wise
son
of
ali
pasha
a
servant
of
his
majesty
sultan
ahmet
who
had
been
employed
for
years
in
the
palace
begged
leave
of
the
sultan
to
allow
him
to
retire
to
his
native
home
and
at
the
same
time
solicited
a
pension
to
enable
him
to
live
the
sultan
asked
him
if
he
had
not
saved
any
money
the
man
replied
that
owing
to
his
having
to
support
a
large
family
he
had
been
unable
to
do
so
the
sultan
was
very
angry
that
any
of
his
servants
especially
in
the
immediate
employ
of
his
household
should
after
so
many
years
service
say
that
he
was
penniless
disbelieving
the
statement
and
in
order
to
make
an
example
the
sultan
gave
orders
that
hassan
should
quit
the
palace
in
the
identical
state
he
had
entered
it
years
before
hassan
was
accordingly
disrobed
of
all
his
splendor
and
his
various
effects
the
accumulation
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
were
confiscated
and
distributed
amongst
the
legion
of
palace
servants
poor
hassan
without
a
piaster
in
his
pocket
and
dressed
in
the
rude
costume
of
his
native
province
began
his
weary
journey
homeward
on
foot
in
time
he
reached
the
suburbs
of
a
town
in
asia
minor
and
seeing
some
boys
playing
he
approached
them
sat
on
the
ground
and
watched
their
pastime
the
boys
were
playing
at
state
affairs
one
was
a
sultan
another
his
vizier
who
had
his
cabinet
of
ministers
while
close
by
were
a
number
of
boys
bound
hand
and
foot
representing
political
and
other
prisoners
awaiting
judgment
for
their
imaginary
misdeeds
the
sultan
who
was
sitting
with
worthy
dignity
on
a
throne
made
of
branches
and
stones
decorated
with
centrepieces
beckoned
to
hassan
to
draw
near
and
asked
him
where
he
had
come
from
hassan
replied
that
he
had
come
from
stamboul
from
the
palace
of
the
sultan
that
a
lie
said
the
mock
sultan
no
one
ever
came
from
stamboul
dressed
in
that
fashion
much
less
from
the
palace
you
are
from
the
far
interior
and
if
you
do
not
confess
that
what
i
say
is
true
you
will
be
tried
by
my
ministers
and
punished
accordingly
hassan
partly
to
participate
in
their
boyish
amusement
and
partly
to
unburden
his
aching
heart
related
his
sad
fate
to
his
youthful
audience
when
he
had
finished
the
boy
sultan
ali
by
name
asked
him
if
he
had
received
his
years
hassan
not
fully
grasping
what
the
boy
said
replied
nothing
nothing
that
is
unjust
continued
ali
and
you
shall
go
back
to
the
sultan
and
ask
that
your
years
be
returned
to
you
so
that
you
may
plough
and
till
your
ground
and
thus
make
provision
for
the
period
of
want
old
age
hassan
was
struck
by
the
sound
advice
the
boy
had
given
him
thanked
him
and
said
he
would
follow
it
to
the
letter
the
boys
then
in
thoughtless
mirth
separated
to
return
to
their
homes
never
dreaming
that
the
seeds
of
destiny
of
one
of
their
number
had
been
sown
in
play
hassan
retracing
his
steps
reappeared
in
time
at
the
gates
of
the
palace
and
begged
admittance
stating
that
he
had
forgotten
to
communicate
something
of
importance
to
his
majesty
his
request
being
granted
he
humbly
solicited
that
inasmuch
as
his
majesty
had
been
dissatisfied
with
his
long
service
the
years
he
had
devoted
to
him
should
be
returned
so
that
he
might
labor
and
put
by
something
to
provide
for
the
inevitable
day
when
he
could
no
longer
work
the
sultan
answered
that
is
well
said
and
just
as
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
give
you
the
years
the
best
equivalent
i
can
grant
you
is
the
means
of
sustenance
for
a
period
of
that
duration
should
you
live
so
long
but
tell
me
who
advised
you
to
make
this
request
hassan
then
related
his
adventure
with
the
boys
while
on
his
journey
home
and
his
majesty
was
so
pleased
with
the
judgment
and
advice
of
the
lad
that
he
sent
for
him
and
had
him
educated
the
boy
studied
medicine
and
distinguishing
himself
in
the
profession
ultimately
rose
to
be
hekim
ali
pasha
he
had
one
son
who
was
known
as
doctor
ali
pasha
son
he
studied
calligraphy
and
became
so
proficient
in
this
art
now
almost
lost
that
his
imitations
of
the
imperial
iradÃ©s
decrees
were
perfect
of
the
originals
one
day
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
write
an
iradÃ©
appointing
himself
grand
vizier
in
place
of
the
reigning
one
a
protÃ©gÃ©
of
the
imperial
palace
which
iradÃ©
he
took
to
the
sublime
porte
and
there
and
then
installed
himself
by
chance
the
sultan
happened
to
drive
through
stamboul
that
day
in
disguise
and
noticing
considerable
excitement
and
cries
of
padishahim
chok
yasha
long
live
my
sultan
amongst
the
people
made
inquiries
as
to
the
cause
of
this
unusual
occurrence
his
majesty
informers
brought
him
the
word
that
the
people
rejoiced
in
the
fall
of
the
old
grand
vizier
and
the
appointment
of
the
new
one
doctor
ali
pasha
son
the
sultan
returned
to
the
palace
and
immediately
sent
one
of
his
eunuchs
to
the
sublime
porte
to
see
the
grand
vizier
and
find
out
the
meaning
of
these
strange
proceedings
the
eunuch
was
announced
and
the
grand
vizier
ordered
him
to
be
brought
into
his
presence
directly
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
was
greeted
with
what
do
you
want
you
black
dog
then
turning
to
the
numerous
attendants
about
he
said
take
this
nigger
to
the
slave
market
and
see
what
price
he
will
bring
the
eunuch
was
taken
to
the
slave
market
and
the
highest
price
bid
for
him
was
fifty
piasters
on
hearing
this
the
grand
vizier
turned
to
the
eunuch
and
said
go
and
tell
your
master
what
you
are
worth
and
tell
him
that
i
think
it
too
much
by
far
the
eunuch
was
glad
to
get
off
and
communicated
to
his
majesty
the
story
of
his
strange
treatment
the
sultan
then
ordered
his
chief
eunuch
a
not
unimportant
personage
in
the
ottoman
empire
to
call
on
the
grand
vizier
for
an
explanation
at
the
sublime
porte
however
no
respect
was
paid
to
this
high
dignitary
ali
pasha
received
him
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
he
had
received
his
subordinate
the
chief
was
taken
to
the
slave
market
and
the
highest
sum
bid
for
him
was
five
hundred
piasters
the
grand
vizier
ordered
him
to
go
and
tell
his
master
the
amount
some
foolish
people
were
willing
to
pay
for
him
when
the
sultan
heard
of
these
strange
proceedings
he
sent
an
autograph
letter
to
ali
pasha
commanding
him
to
come
to
the
palace
the
grand
vizier
immediately
set
out
for
the
palace
and
was
received
in
audience
when
he
explained
to
his
majesty
that
the
affairs
of
state
could
not
be
managed
by
men
not
worth
more
than
from
fifty
to
five
hundred
piasters
and
that
if
radical
changes
were
not
made
certain
ruin
would
be
the
outcome
the
sultan
appreciated
this
earnest
communication
and
ratified
the
appointment
as
grand
vizier
of
ali
pasha
the
son
of
the
boy
who
had
played
at
state
affairs
in
a
village
of
asia
minor
the
merciful
khan
there
lived
once
near
ispahan
a
tailor
a
man
who
was
very
poor
so
poor
was
he
that
his
workshop
and
house
together
consisted
of
a
wooden
cottage
of
but
one
room
but
poverty
is
no
protection
against
thieves
and
so
it
happened
that
one
night
a
thief
entered
the
hut
of
the
tailor
the
tailor
had
driven
nails
in
various
places
in
the
walls
on
which
to
hang
the
garments
that
were
brought
to
him
to
mend
it
chanced
that
in
groping
about
for
plunder
the
thief
struck
against
one
of
these
nails
and
put
out
his
eye
the
next
morning
the
thief
appeared
before
the
khan
judge
and
demanded
justice
the
khan
accordingly
sent
for
the
tailor
stated
the
complaint
of
the
thief
and
said
that
in
accordance
with
the
law
eye
for
an
eye
it
would
be
necessary
to
put
out
one
of
the
tailor
eyes
as
usual
however
the
tailor
was
allowed
to
plead
in
his
own
defence
whereupon
he
thus
addressed
the
court
oh
great
and
mighty
khan
it
is
true
that
the
law
says
eye
for
an
eye
but
it
does
not
say
eye
now
i
am
a
poor
man
and
a
tailor
if
the
khan
puts
out
one
of
my
eyes
i
will
not
be
able
to
carry
on
my
trade
and
so
i
shall
starve
now
it
happens
that
there
lives
near
me
a
gunsmith
he
uses
but
one
eye
with
which
he
squints
along
the
barrel
of
his
guns
take
his
other
eye
oh
khan
and
let
the
law
be
satisfied
the
khan
was
favorably
impressed
with
this
idea
and
accordingly
sent
for
the
gunsmith
he
recited
to
the
gunsmith
the
complaint
of
the
thief
and
the
statement
of
the
tailor
whereupon
the
gunsmith
said
oh
great
and
mighty
khan
this
tailor
knows
not
whereof
he
talks
i
need
both
of
my
eyes
for
while
it
is
true
that
i
squint
one
eye
along
one
side
of
the
barrel
of
the
gun
to
see
if
it
is
straight
i
must
use
the
other
eye
for
the
other
side
if
therefore
you
put
out
one
of
my
eyes
you
will
take
away
from
me
the
means
of
livelihood
it
happens
however
that
there
lives
not
far
from
me
a
now
i
have
noticed
that
whenever
he
plays
the
flute
he
closes
both
of
his
eyes
take
out
one
of
his
eyes
oh
khan
and
let
the
law
be
satisfied
accordingly
the
khan
sent
for
the
and
after
reciting
to
him
the
complaint
of
the
thief
and
the
words
of
the
gunsmith
he
ordered
him
to
play
upon
his
flute
this
the
did
and
though
he
endeavored
to
control
himself
he
did
not
succeed
but
as
the
result
of
long
habit
closed
both
of
his
eyes
when
the
khan
saw
this
he
ordered
that
one
of
the
eyes
be
put
out
which
being
done
the
khan
spoke
as
follows
oh
i
saw
that
when
playing
upon
your
flute
you
closed
both
of
your
eyes
it
was
thus
clear
to
me
that
neither
was
necessary
for
your
livelihood
and
i
had
intended
to
have
them
both
put
out
but
i
have
decided
to
put
out
only
one
in
order
that
you
may
tell
among
men
how
merciful
are
the
khans
king
of
bithynia
a
king
of
bithynia
named
who
was
blind
of
an
eye
was
considered
in
his
day
a
reasonable
just
and
feeling
man
he
administered
justice
upon
the
basis
of
the
law
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
and
enlarged
or
modified
it
as
circumstances
demanded
it
happened
that
a
weaver
by
accident
put
out
the
eye
of
a
man
he
was
brought
before
the
king
or
cadi
for
in
those
days
the
kings
acted
as
cadis
who
promptly
condemned
him
in
accordance
with
the
law
to
the
loss
of
an
eye
the
weaver
pleaded
touchingly
saying
oh
cadi
i
have
a
wife
and
a
large
family
and
i
support
them
by
throwing
the
shuttle
from
the
right
to
the
left
and
again
from
the
left
to
the
right
first
using
the
one
eye
and
then
the
other
if
you
remove
one
of
my
eyes
i
will
not
be
able
to
weave
and
my
wife
and
children
will
suffer
the
pangs
of
hunger
why
not
in
the
place
of
my
eye
remove
that
of
the
hunter
who
uses
but
one
eye
in
exercising
his
profession
and
to
whom
two
eyes
are
superfluous
the
cadi
was
impressed
acknowledged
the
justice
of
the
remarks
and
the
hunter
was
immediately
sent
for
the
hunter
being
brought
the
cadi
was
greatly
rejoiced
to
notice
that
the
eyes
were
exactly
the
same
color
as
his
own
he
asked
the
hunter
how
he
earned
his
living
and
receiving
his
answer
that
he
was
a
hunter
the
cadi
asked
him
how
he
shot
the
hunter
in
reply
demonstrated
the
manner
by
putting
up
his
arms
his
head
to
a
side
and
closing
one
eye
the
cadi
said
the
weaver
was
right
and
immediately
sent
for
the
surgeon
to
have
the
eye
removed
further
the
cadi
bethought
him
that
he
might
profit
by
this
and
have
the
hunter
eye
placed
in
his
own
socket
the
surgeon
set
to
work
and
prepared
the
cavity
to
receive
the
hunter
eye
this
done
with
a
practised
hand
the
surgeon
removed
the
hunter
eye
and
was
about
to
place
it
in
the
prepared
socket
when
it
accidentally
slipped
from
his
fingers
to
the
ground
and
was
snatched
up
by
a
cat
the
surgeon
was
terrified
and
madly
ran
after
the
cat
but
alas
the
cat
had
eaten
the
eye
what
was
he
to
do
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
he
snatched
out
the
eye
of
the
cat
and
placing
it
in
the
cadi
head
bound
it
up
some
time
after
the
surgeon
asked
the
cadi
how
he
saw
oh
replied
the
cadi
with
my
old
eye
i
see
as
usual
but
strange
to
say
the
new
eye
you
placed
in
my
head
is
continually
searching
and
watching
for
rat
holes
the
prayer
rug
and
the
dishonest
steward
a
poor
hamal
porter
brought
to
the
pasha
of
stamboul
his
savings
consisting
of
a
small
canvas
bag
of
medjidies
turkish
silver
dollars
to
be
kept
for
him
while
he
was
absent
on
a
visit
to
his
home
the
pasha
being
a
man
consented
and
after
sealing
the
bag
called
his
steward
instructing
him
to
keep
it
till
the
owner
called
for
it
the
steward
gave
the
man
a
receipt
to
the
effect
that
he
had
received
a
sealed
bag
containing
money
when
the
poor
man
returned
he
went
to
the
pasha
and
received
his
bag
of
money
on
reaching
his
room
he
opened
the
bag
and
to
his
horror
found
that
it
contained
instead
of
the
medjidies
he
had
put
in
it
copper
piasters
which
are
about
the
same
size
as
medjidies
the
poor
hamal
was
miserable
his
savings
gone
he
at
last
gathered
courage
to
go
and
put
his
case
before
the
pasha
he
took
the
bag
of
piasters
and
with
trembling
voice
and
faltering
heart
he
assured
the
pasha
that
though
he
had
received
his
bag
apparently
intact
on
opening
it
he
found
that
it
contained
copper
piasters
and
not
the
medjidies
he
had
put
in
it
the
pasha
took
the
bag
examined
it
closely
and
after
some
time
noticed
a
part
that
had
apparently
been
darned
by
a
the
pasha
told
the
hamal
to
go
away
and
come
back
in
a
week
in
the
meantime
he
would
see
what
he
could
do
for
him
the
grateful
man
departed
uttering
prayers
for
the
life
and
prosperity
of
his
excellency
the
next
morning
after
the
pasha
had
said
his
prayers
kneeling
on
a
most
magnificent
and
expensive
rug
he
took
a
knife
and
cut
a
long
rent
in
it
he
then
left
his
konak
without
saying
a
word
to
any
one
in
the
evening
when
he
returned
he
found
that
the
rent
had
been
so
well
repaired
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
discovered
where
it
had
been
calling
his
steward
he
demanded
who
had
repaired
his
prayer
rug
the
steward
told
the
pasha
that
he
thought
the
rug
had
been
cut
by
accident
by
some
of
the
servants
so
he
had
sent
to
the
bazaar
for
the
darner
mustapha
and
had
it
mended
the
steward
by
way
of
apology
adding
that
it
was
very
well
done
send
for
mustapha
immediately
said
the
pasha
and
when
he
comes
bring
him
to
my
room
when
mustapha
arrived
the
pasha
asked
him
if
he
had
repaired
the
rug
mustapha
at
once
replied
that
he
had
mended
it
that
very
morning
it
is
indeed
well
done
said
the
pasha
much
better
than
the
darn
you
made
in
that
canvas
bag
mustapha
agreed
saying
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
mend
the
bag
as
it
was
full
of
copper
piasters
on
hearing
this
the
pasha
gave
him
a
backsheesh
present
and
told
him
to
retire
the
pasha
then
called
his
steward
and
not
only
compelled
him
to
pay
the
hamal
his
money
but
discharged
him
from
his
service
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
for
many
years
the
goose
the
eye
the
daughter
and
the
arm
a
turk
decided
to
have
a
feast
so
he
killed
and
stuffed
a
goose
and
took
it
to
the
baker
to
be
roasted
the
cadi
of
the
village
happened
to
pass
by
the
oven
as
the
baker
was
basting
the
goose
and
was
attracted
by
the
pleasant
and
appetizing
odor
approaching
the
baker
the
cadi
said
it
was
a
fine
goose
that
the
smell
of
it
made
him
quite
hungry
and
suggested
that
he
had
better
send
it
to
his
house
the
baker
expostulated
saying
i
can
not
it
does
not
belong
to
me
the
cadi
assured
him
that
was
no
difficulty
you
tell
ahmet
the
owner
of
the
goose
that
it
flew
away
impossible
said
the
baker
how
can
a
roasted
goose
fly
away
ahmet
will
only
laugh
at
me
your
worship
and
i
will
be
cast
into
prison
am
i
not
a
judge
said
the
cadi
fear
nothing
at
this
the
baker
consented
to
send
the
goose
to
the
cadi
house
when
ahmet
came
for
his
goose
the
baker
said
friend
thy
goose
has
flown
flown
said
ahmet
what
lies
am
i
thy
grandfather
grandchild
that
thou
shouldst
laugh
in
my
beard
seizing
one
of
the
baker
large
shovels
he
lifted
it
to
strike
him
but
as
fate
would
have
it
the
handle
put
out
the
eye
of
the
boy
and
ahmet
frightened
at
what
he
had
done
ran
off
closely
followed
by
the
baker
and
his
boy
the
latter
crying
my
eye
in
his
hurry
ahmet
knocked
over
a
child
killing
it
and
the
father
of
the
child
joined
in
the
chase
calling
out
my
daughter
ahmet
distracted
rushed
into
a
mosque
and
up
a
minaret
to
escape
his
pursuers
he
leaped
from
the
parapet
and
fell
upon
a
vender
who
was
passing
by
breaking
his
arm
the
vender
also
began
pursuing
him
calling
out
my
arm
ahmet
was
finally
caught
and
brought
before
the
cadi
who
no
doubt
was
feeling
contented
with
the
world
having
just
enjoyed
the
delicious
goose
the
cadi
heard
each
of
the
cases
brought
against
ahmet
who
in
turn
told
his
case
truthfully
as
it
had
happened
a
complicated
matter
said
the
cadi
all
these
misfortunes
come
from
the
flight
of
the
goose
and
i
must
refer
to
the
book
of
the
law
to
give
just
judgment
taking
down
a
ponderous
manuscript
volume
the
cadi
turned
to
ahmet
and
asked
him
what
number
egg
the
goose
had
been
hatched
from
ahmet
said
he
did
not
know
then
replied
the
cadi
the
book
writes
that
such
a
phenomenon
was
possible
if
this
goose
was
hatched
from
the
seventh
egg
and
the
hatcher
also
from
the
seventh
egg
the
book
writes
that
it
is
possible
for
a
roasted
goose
under
those
conditions
to
fly
away
with
reference
to
your
eye
continued
the
cadi
addressing
the
baker
lad
the
book
provides
punishment
for
the
removal
of
two
eyes
but
not
of
one
so
if
you
will
consent
to
your
other
eye
being
taken
out
i
will
condemn
ahmet
to
have
both
of
his
removed
the
baker
lad
not
appreciating
the
force
of
this
argument
withdrew
his
claim
then
turning
to
the
father
of
the
dead
child
the
cadi
explained
that
the
only
provision
for
a
case
like
this
in
the
book
of
the
law
was
that
he
take
ahmet
child
in
its
place
or
if
ahmet
had
not
a
child
to
wait
till
he
got
one
the
bereaved
parent
not
taking
any
interest
in
ahmet
present
or
prospective
children
also
withdrew
his
case
these
cases
settled
there
remained
but
the
vender
who
was
wroth
at
having
his
arm
broken
the
cadi
expatiated
on
the
justice
of
the
law
and
its
provisions
that
the
vender
at
least
could
claim
ample
compensation
for
having
his
arm
broken
the
book
of
the
law
provided
that
he
should
go
to
the
very
same
minaret
and
that
ahmet
must
station
himself
at
the
very
same
place
where
he
had
stood
when
his
arm
was
broken
and
that
he
might
jump
down
and
break
ahmet
arm
but
be
it
understood
concluded
the
cadi
if
you
break
his
leg
instead
of
his
arm
ahmet
will
have
the
right
to
delegate
some
one
to
jump
down
on
you
to
break
your
leg
the
vender
not
seeing
the
force
of
the
cadi
proposal
also
withdrew
his
claim
thus
ended
the
cases
of
the
goose
the
eye
the
daughter
and
the
arm
the
forty
wise
men
on
a
day
amongst
the
many
days
when
the
turk
was
more
earnest
than
now
before
the
europeans
came
and
gave
new
ideas
to
our
children
there
lived
and
labored
for
the
welfare
of
our
people
an
organized
body
of
men
at
whose
suggestion
this
society
was
formed
i
know
not
all
that
we
know
of
them
through
our
fathers
is
that
their
forefathers
chose
from
among
them
the
most
wise
sincere
and
experienced
forty
brethren
these
forty
were
named
the
forty
wise
men
when
one
of
the
forty
was
called
away
from
his
labors
here
perhaps
to
continue
them
in
higher
spheres
or
to
receive
his
reward
who
knows
the
remaining
consulted
and
chose
from
the
community
him
whom
they
thought
capable
and
worthy
of
guiding
and
of
being
guided
to
add
to
their
number
they
lived
and
held
their
meetings
in
a
mosque
of
which
little
remains
now
the
destructive
hand
of
time
having
left
it
but
a
battered
dome
with
cheerless
walls
and
great
square
holes
where
once
were
iron
bars
and
stained
glass
it
has
gone
so
have
the
wise
men
but
its
foundations
are
solid
and
they
may
in
time
come
to
support
an
edifice
dedicated
to
noble
work
and
inshallah
the
seed
of
the
forty
wise
men
will
also
bear
fruit
in
the
days
that
are
not
yet
you
will
say
what
good
did
this
body
of
men
do
these
men
who
always
numbered
forty
were
as
i
have
told
you
originally
chosen
by
the
people
and
when
one
of
the
forty
departed
from
his
labors
here
the
remaining
consulted
together
and
from
the
most
worthy
of
the
community
they
chose
another
member
what
was
the
good
of
this
body
of
men
great
great
my
friends
not
only
did
they
administer
justice
to
the
oppressed
and
give
to
the
needy
substantial
aid
but
their
very
existence
had
the
most
beneficial
effect
on
the
community
why
you
ask
because
each
vied
with
the
other
to
be
worthy
of
being
nominated
for
the
vacancy
when
it
occurred
no
station
in
life
was
too
low
to
be
admitted
no
station
was
too
high
for
one
of
the
faithful
to
become
one
of
the
here
all
were
equal
as
allah
himself
doth
consider
mankind
by
deeds
so
also
mankind
was
considered
by
the
forty
wise
men
who
presided
over
the
welfare
and
smoothed
the
destiny
of
the
children
of
allah
with
their
years
their
wisdom
grew
and
they
were
blessed
by
allah
in
the
town
of
scutari
over
the
way
there
lived
and
labored
a
dervish
his
counsel
to
the
rash
was
ever
ready
his
sole
object
apparently
in
life
was
to
become
one
of
the
forty
wise
men
who
presided
over
the
people
and
protected
them
from
all
ills
the
years
went
on
and
still
without
a
reward
he
patiently
labored
no
doubt
contenting
himself
with
the
idea
that
the
day
would
come
when
the
merit
of
his
actions
would
be
recognized
by
allah
that
was
a
mistake
my
friends
true
faith
expecteth
nothing
however
the
day
did
come
and
the
dervish
great
desire
had
every
appearance
of
being
realized
one
of
the
forty
wise
men
having
accomplished
his
mission
on
earth
departed
this
life
the
remaining
who
still
had
duties
to
fulfil
consulted
as
to
whom
they
should
call
to
aid
them
in
their
work
a
eulogy
was
pronounced
in
favor
of
the
dervish
they
not
unjustly
considered
how
he
had
labored
among
the
poor
in
scutari
ever
ready
to
help
the
needy
ever
ready
to
counsel
the
rash
ever
ready
to
comfort
and
encourage
the
despairing
it
was
decided
that
he
should
be
nominated
a
deputation
consisting
of
three
two
to
listen
one
to
speak
was
named
and
with
the
blessing
of
their
brethren
for
success
they
entered
a
caique
and
were
rowed
to
scutari
arriving
at
the
dervish
gate
the
spokesman
thus
addressed
the
member
of
the
forty
wise
men
brother
in
the
flesh
thy
actions
have
been
noted
and
we
come
to
put
a
proposition
to
thee
which
after
consideration
thou
wilt
either
accept
or
reject
as
thou
thinkest
best
for
all
interested
therein
we
would
ask
thee
to
become
one
of
us
we
are
sent
hither
by
and
are
the
representatives
of
the
sages
who
preside
over
the
people
brother
we
number
in
all
one
hundred
and
in
spirit
having
accomplished
their
task
in
the
flesh
have
departed
still
in
the
flesh
endeavor
their
duty
to
fulfil
and
it
is
the
desire
of
the
one
hundred
and
souls
to
add
to
us
thyself
in
order
to
complete
our
number
of
laborers
in
the
flesh
brother
thy
duties
which
will
be
everlasting
thou
wilt
learn
when
with
us
do
thou
consider
and
we
will
return
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
of
the
third
day
to
receive
thy
answer
and
they
turned
to
depart
but
the
dervish
stopped
them
saying
brothers
i
have
no
need
to
consider
the
subject
for
three
days
seeing
that
my
inmost
desire
for
thirty
years
and
my
sole
object
in
life
has
been
to
become
worthy
of
being
one
of
you
in
spirit
i
have
long
been
your
brother
in
the
flesh
it
is
easy
to
comply
seeing
that
it
has
been
the
spirit
desire
then
answered
the
spokesman
brother
thou
hast
spoken
well
allah
thou
art
with
us
in
our
choice
we
praise
thee
brother
one
word
our
ways
are
different
to
all
men
ways
thou
hast
but
to
have
faith
and
all
is
well
brethren
faith
i
have
had
faith
my
faith
is
now
even
strengthened
i
do
your
bidding
brother
first
of
all
thy
worldly
goods
must
be
disposed
of
and
rendered
into
gold
every
earthly
possession
thou
hast
must
be
represented
by
a
piece
of
gold
therefore
see
to
that
we
have
other
duties
to
fulfil
but
will
return
ere
the
sun
sets
in
the
west
the
dervish
set
about
selling
all
his
goods
and
when
the
coloring
of
the
sky
in
the
west
harbingered
the
closing
of
the
day
he
had
disposed
of
everything
and
stood
waiting
with
naught
but
a
sack
of
gold
the
three
wise
men
returned
and
on
seeing
the
dervish
said
brother
thou
hast
done
well
we
will
hence
a
caique
was
in
waiting
and
the
four
entered
silently
the
caique
glided
over
the
smooth
surface
of
the
bosphorus
and
silently
the
occupants
sat
when
beyond
maidens
tower
the
spokesman
turning
to
the
dervish
said
brother
with
thy
inmost
blessing
give
me
that
sack
representing
everything
thou
dost
possess
in
this
world
the
dervish
handed
the
sack
as
he
was
bidden
and
the
wise
man
solemnly
rose
and
holding
it
on
high
said
with
the
blessing
of
our
brother
mustapha
and
dropped
it
where
the
current
is
strongest
then
sitting
down
resumed
his
silence
the
deed
was
done
and
nothing
outward
told
the
story
the
caiquedji
dipped
his
oars
and
the
waves
rippled
as
soft
as
before
nothing
but
the
distant
soothing
cry
of
the
muezzin
calling
the
faithful
to
prayer
now
waxing
now
waning
now
completely
dying
away
as
they
moved
around
the
minarets
broke
the
stillness
ere
long
the
boat
was
brought
to
the
shore
the
four
men
wended
their
way
up
the
steep
hill
and
the
horizon
wrapped
in
the
mantle
of
night
hid
them
from
the
boatman
sight
a
few
minutes
walk
brought
them
to
the
mosque
of
the
forty
wise
men
the
spokesman
turned
to
the
dervish
and
said
brother
faithfully
follow
and
then
passed
through
the
doorway
they
entered
a
large
vaulted
chamber
the
ceiling
of
which
was
artistically
inlaid
with
mosaÃ¯ques
and
the
floor
covered
with
tiles
of
the
ceramic
art
of
bygone
ages
from
the
centre
hung
a
large
chandelier
holding
a
number
of
little
oil
cups
each
shedding
its
tiny
light
as
if
to
show
that
union
was
strength
round
this
chandelier
were
seven
brass
filagreed
lanterns
holding
several
oil
burners
these
many
tiny
burners
gave
a
soothing
contented
though
undefined
light
which
together
with
the
silence
added
to
the
impressiveness
of
the
place
round
this
hall
were
forty
boxes
of
the
same
shape
and
size
our
friend
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
and
under
the
influence
of
the
scene
he
was
afraid
to
breathe
he
did
not
know
whether
to
be
happy
or
sad
for
having
come
so
far
as
he
stood
thus
thinking
dreaming
one
of
the
curtains
was
raised
and
there
came
forth
a
very
old
man
his
venerable
white
beard
all
but
touching
his
girdle
solemnly
and
slowly
he
walked
over
to
the
opposite
side
and
following
in
his
train
came
more
the
last
apparently
being
the
youngest
chill
after
chill
went
coursing
down
the
spinal
cord
of
the
astonished
brother
whilst
these
men
moved
about
in
the
unbroken
silence
as
if
talking
to
invisible
beings
now
embracing
now
clasping
hands
now
bidding
farewell
the
dervish
closed
his
eyes
opened
them
were
these
things
so
yes
it
was
no
dream
no
hallucination
yet
why
heard
he
no
sound
each
of
the
brethren
now
took
his
place
beside
a
box
but
there
was
one
vacancy
no
one
stood
at
the
side
of
the
box
to
the
left
of
the
youngest
brother
making
a
profound
salaam
which
all
answered
the
old
man
silently
turned
raised
the
curtain
and
passed
into
the
darkness
each
in
his
order
following
as
one
in
a
trance
the
dervish
watched
one
after
another
disappear
the
last
now
raised
the
curtain
but
before
vanishing
turned
it
was
the
spokesman
and
whispered
brother
faith
follow
and
stepped
into
the
darkness
these
words
acted
upon
the
dervish
like
a
spell
he
followed
up
up
the
winding
stairway
of
a
minaret
they
go
at
last
they
arrive
and
to
the
horror
of
the
dervish
what
does
he
see
one
two
three
disappear
over
the
parapet
and
his
friend
the
spokesman
with
brother
faith
follow
also
vanished
into
the
inky
darkness
again
at
the
eleventh
hour
did
the
cheering
words
of
the
brother
spokesman
act
upon
the
dervish
like
magic
he
raised
his
foot
to
the
parapet
and
in
faltering
decision
jumped
up
two
or
three
times
but
man
guardian
does
not
lead
him
over
the
rugged
paths
of
life
he
gives
the
impulse
and
you
must
go
so
it
was
with
the
dervish
he
jumped
once
twice
thrice
but
each
time
fell
backward
instead
of
forward
my
friends
he
hesitated
again
at
the
eleventh
hour
he
was
encouraged
but
undecided
he
was
not
equal
to
the
test
so
with
a
great
weight
on
his
heart
he
descended
the
winding
stairs
of
the
minaret
he
had
reached
his
zenith
only
in
desire
and
was
now
on
his
decline
lamenting
like
a
weak
mortal
that
he
was
for
not
having
followed
he
again
entered
the
hall
he
had
just
left
with
the
intention
no
doubt
of
departing
but
the
charm
of
the
place
was
on
him
again
and
as
he
stood
the
curtain
moved
and
the
old
man
advanced
and
as
before
the
silence
was
unbroken
again
did
each
take
his
place
beside
a
box
again
did
the
old
man
salaam
with
the
simultaneous
response
of
the
others
again
did
they
gesture
as
if
talking
to
invisible
beings
of
some
calamity
which
had
befallen
them
which
they
all
regretted
the
old
man
went
and
opened
the
box
that
stood
alone
from
this
he
took
what
the
identical
bag
of
gold
that
had
been
dropped
into
the
bosphorus
some
hours
ago
the
spokesman
came
forward
and
took
it
from
the
hand
of
the
old
man
the
dervish
now
no
longer
believed
that
was
himself
and
that
these
things
were
taking
place
he
understood
not
he
knew
not
coming
forward
the
spokesman
thus
addressed
the
dervish
his
voice
giving
a
strange
echo
as
if
his
words
were
emphasized
by
a
hundred
invisible
mouths
friend
and
brother
in
the
flesh
but
weak
of
the
spirit
thou
hast
proved
thyself
unworthy
to
impart
that
which
thou
hast
not
thyself
faith
thine
actions
hitherto
of
seeming
conviction
have
not
been
for
the
eye
of
the
almighty
the
the
alone
but
for
the
approbation
of
mankind
to
get
this
approbation
thou
hast
soared
out
of
thine
element
the
atmosphere
is
too
rarified
thou
canst
not
live
thou
must
return
get
thee
back
into
the
world
back
to
thy
brothers
thou
canst
not
be
one
of
us
one
hundred
and
in
the
spirit
have
regretfully
judged
thee
as
lacking
in
faith
and
not
having
a
sheltered
apartment
within
thyself
thou
canst
not
shelter
others
no
man
can
bequeath
that
which
he
hath
not
go
thy
way
and
in
secret
build
thee
a
wall
brick
by
brick
action
by
action
let
none
see
thy
place
but
the
eye
that
seeth
all
lest
a
side
when
all
but
completed
fall
and
thou
art
again
exposed
to
the
four
winds
take
thy
money
thine
all
and
when
hesitation
interrupts
offer
a
prayer
in
thy
heart
and
then
faithfully
follow
farewell
and
the
dervish
was
led
out
into
the
street
a
lone
and
solitary
man
he
had
his
all
in
his
hand
a
bag
of
gold
how
the
priest
knew
that
it
would
snow
a
turk
travelling
in
asia
minor
came
to
a
christian
village
he
journeyed
on
horseback
was
accompanied
by
a
black
slave
and
seeming
a
man
of
consequence
the
priest
of
the
village
offered
him
hospitality
for
the
night
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
conduct
the
traveller
to
the
stable
that
he
might
see
his
horse
attended
to
and
comfortably
stalled
for
the
night
in
the
stable
was
a
magnificent
arab
horse
belonging
to
the
priest
and
the
turk
gazed
upon
it
with
covetous
eyes
but
nevertheless
in
order
that
no
ill
should
befall
the
beautiful
creature
and
to
counteract
the
influence
of
the
evil
eye
with
certainty
he
spat
at
the
animal
after
they
had
dined
the
priest
took
his
guest
for
a
walk
in
the
garden
and
in
the
course
of
a
very
pleasant
conversation
he
informed
the
turk
that
on
the
morrow
there
would
be
snow
on
the
ground
never
impossible
said
the
turk
well
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
said
the
priest
i
am
willing
to
stake
my
horse
against
yours
that
you
are
wrong
answered
the
turk
who
was
delighted
at
this
opportunity
which
gave
him
a
chance
of
securing
the
horse
without
committing
the
breach
in
oriental
etiquette
of
asking
his
host
if
he
would
sell
it
after
some
persuasion
the
priest
accepted
his
wager
and
they
separated
for
the
night
later
on
that
night
the
turk
said
to
his
slave
go
sali
go
and
see
what
the
weather
says
for
truly
my
life
is
in
want
of
our
good
horse
sali
went
out
to
make
an
observation
and
on
returning
said
to
his
master
master
the
heavens
are
like
unto
your
face
without
a
frown
and
many
kindly
sparkling
eyes
and
the
earth
is
like
unto
that
of
your
black
slave
is
well
sali
is
well
what
a
beautiful
animal
that
is
later
on
before
retiring
to
rest
he
sent
his
slave
on
another
inspection
and
was
gratified
to
receive
the
same
answer
early
in
the
morning
he
awoke
and
calling
his
slave
who
had
slept
at
his
door
he
sent
him
forth
again
to
see
if
any
change
had
taken
place
oh
master
reported
sali
in
trembling
tones
nature
has
reversed
herself
for
the
heavens
are
now
like
the
scowling
face
of
your
slave
and
the
earth
is
like
yours
white
entirely
white
chok
shai
wonderful
thing
then
i
have
lost
not
only
that
beautiful
animal
but
my
own
horse
as
well
oh
pity
oh
pity
he
gave
up
his
horse
but
before
parting
he
begged
the
priest
to
tell
him
how
he
knew
it
would
snow
my
pig
told
me
as
we
were
walking
in
the
garden
yesterday
i
saw
it
put
its
nose
in
the
heap
of
manure
you
see
in
that
corner
and
i
knew
that
to
be
a
sure
sign
that
it
would
snow
on
the
morrow
replied
the
priest
deeply
mystified
the
turk
and
his
slave
proceeded
on
foot
reaching
a
turkish
village
before
nightfall
he
sought
and
obtained
shelter
for
the
night
from
the
imam
the
mohammedan
priest
of
the
village
while
partaking
of
the
evening
meal
he
asked
the
imam
when
the
feast
of
the
bairam
would
be
truly
i
do
not
know
when
the
cannons
fire
i
will
know
it
is
bairam
said
his
host
what
said
the
traveller
becoming
angry
you
an
imam
a
learned
hodja
and
do
know
when
it
will
be
bairam
and
the
pig
of
the
greek
priest
knew
when
it
would
snow
shame
shame
and
becoming
much
angered
he
declined
the
hospitality
of
the
imam
and
went
elsewhere
who
was
the
thirteenth
son
in
the
town
of
adrianople
there
lived
an
armenian
patriarch
munadi
hagop
by
name
respected
and
loved
alike
by
mussulman
and
christian
he
was
a
man
of
wide
reading
and
profound
judgment
the
ottoman
governor
of
the
same
place
usref
pasha
happened
also
to
be
a
man
of
considerable
acquirements
and
education
the
armenian
and
the
turk
associated
much
together
in
fact
they
were
always
either
walking
out
together
or
visiting
one
at
the
residence
of
the
other
this
went
on
for
some
time
and
the
twelve
wise
men
who
were
judges
in
the
city
thought
that
their
governor
was
doing
wrong
in
associating
so
much
with
a
dog
of
a
christian
so
they
resolved
to
call
him
to
account
this
resolution
taken
the
entire
twelve
proceeded
to
the
house
of
the
governor
and
told
him
that
he
was
setting
a
bad
example
to
his
subjects
they
feared
too
that
the
salvation
of
his
own
soul
and
of
his
posterity
was
in
danger
should
this
armenian
in
any
way
influence
his
mind
my
friends
answered
the
governor
this
man
is
very
learned
and
the
only
reason
why
we
so
often
come
together
is
because
a
great
sympathy
exists
between
us
and
much
mutual
pleasure
is
derived
from
this
friendship
i
ask
his
advice
and
he
gives
me
a
clear
explanation
he
is
my
friend
and
i
would
gladly
see
him
your
friend
oh
said
the
spokesman
of
the
judges
it
is
his
wise
answers
that
act
as
magic
upon
you
we
will
give
him
a
question
to
answer
and
if
he
solves
this
to
our
satisfaction
he
will
then
in
reality
be
a
great
man
i
am
sure
you
will
not
be
disappointed
said
the
pasha
he
has
never
failed
me
and
i
have
sometimes
put
questions
to
him
which
appeared
unanswerable
he
will
surely
call
shall
i
send
him
to
you
or
bring
him
myself
we
wish
to
see
him
alone
said
the
judges
i
shall
not
fail
to
send
him
to
you
after
which
i
am
sure
you
will
often
seek
his
company
on
the
following
day
the
pasha
told
the
patriarch
how
matters
stood
and
begged
him
to
call
on
the
gentlemen
who
took
so
lively
an
interest
in
their
friendly
association
the
patriarch
never
dreaming
of
what
would
happen
called
on
the
twelve
wise
men
and
introduced
himself
they
were
holding
the
divan
and
the
entrance
of
the
patriarch
gave
considerable
pleasure
to
them
on
the
table
lay
a
turban
and
a
drawn
sword
the
customary
salutations
having
been
duly
exchanged
the
patriarch
seated
himself
and
at
once
told
them
that
his
friend
the
governor
had
asked
him
to
call
and
he
took
much
pleasure
in
making
their
acquaintance
adding
that
he
would
be
happy
to
do
anything
in
his
power
that
they
might
wish
the
spokesman
of
the
divan
rose
and
said
effendi
our
friend
the
governor
has
told
us
of
your
great
learning
and
we
have
decided
to
put
a
question
to
you
the
reason
of
our
taking
this
liberty
is
because
the
governor
told
us
that
he
had
never
put
a
question
to
you
which
had
remained
unanswered
and
as
he
spoke
he
moved
toward
the
table
effendi
our
question
will
consist
of
only
a
few
words
and
laying
his
right
hand
on
the
turban
and
his
left
hand
on
the
sword
he
said
is
this
the
right
or
is
this
the
right
the
patriarch
paused
aghast
at
the
terrible
feature
of
the
interrogation
he
saw
destruction
staring
him
in
the
face
nevertheless
he
said
to
them
with
great
composure
gentlemen
you
have
put
an
exceedingly
difficult
question
to
me
the
most
difficult
that
could
be
put
to
man
however
it
is
a
question
put
and
now
according
to
your
laws
can
not
be
recalled
no
answered
the
twelve
wise
men
rubbing
their
hands
it
can
not
be
recalled
i
will
but
say
that
it
grieves
me
much
to
have
to
reply
to
this
the
patriarch
continued
and
i
can
not
do
so
without
continued
prayers
for
guidance
therefore
i
beg
to
request
a
week
time
before
giving
my
answer
to
this
no
objection
was
made
and
the
patriarch
prepared
to
go
respectfully
bowing
to
all
present
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
common
had
happened
he
slowly
moved
toward
the
door
apparently
in
deep
thought
just
as
he
reached
the
door
he
turned
back
and
addressing
the
judges
said
gentlemen
one
of
the
reasons
i
had
great
pleasure
in
meeting
you
was
because
i
wished
to
have
your
advice
on
a
difficult
legal
problem
which
has
been
presented
to
me
by
some
members
of
my
community
knowing
your
great
wisdom
i
thought
you
might
assist
me
and
as
you
are
now
sitting
in
lawful
council
i
shall
if
agreeable
to
you
put
the
case
before
you
and
be
greatly
pleased
to
learn
your
opinion
the
judges
whose
curiosity
was
aroused
and
who
were
flattered
that
a
man
of
such
reputation
for
wisdom
should
submit
a
matter
to
them
for
their
opinion
signified
to
him
to
proceed
gentlemen
and
wise
men
began
the
patriarch
there
was
once
a
father
and
this
father
had
thirteen
sons
who
were
esteemed
by
all
who
knew
them
as
time
with
sure
hand
marked
its
progress
on
the
issue
of
this
good
man
and
the
children
grew
into
youth
they
one
by
one
went
into
the
world
spreading
to
the
four
known
quarters
of
the
globe
and
carrying
with
them
the
good
influence
given
by
their
father
through
them
the
name
of
the
father
spread
causing
a
great
moral
and
mental
revolution
throughout
the
world
the
father
in
his
native
home
however
saw
that
his
days
were
few
that
he
had
turned
the
leaves
of
the
book
of
life
and
yearned
to
see
his
sons
once
more
he
accordingly
sent
messengers
all
over
the
world
saying
my
sons
and
receive
your
father
blessing
he
is
about
to
depart
this
life
come
and
get
each
one
your
portion
of
the
worldly
possessions
i
have
together
with
my
blessing
and
again
go
forth
doing
each
your
duty
to
god
and
man
one
by
one
the
sons
of
the
aged
father
came
and
once
more
were
united
in
the
ancient
home
of
their
childhood
with
the
exception
of
one
son
the
remaining
days
of
the
old
man
were
spent
with
his
twelve
sons
and
the
brothers
found
that
all
of
them
had
retained
the
teachings
of
infancy
and
the
pleasure
was
great
the
reuniting
of
the
family
though
of
comparatively
short
duration
was
happier
by
far
than
the
years
of
childhood
and
youth
which
they
had
spent
together
still
the
thirteenth
son
was
not
found
the
messengers
returned
one
after
the
other
bearing
no
tidings
of
him
the
old
father
saw
that
he
could
wait
no
longer
that
he
must
dispose
of
his
worldly
possessions
give
his
blessing
to
his
twelve
sons
and
rejoin
his
father
so
he
called
them
to
his
side
and
thus
spoke
to
them
sons
as
you
have
done
may
it
be
done
unto
you
you
have
cheered
my
last
steps
to
the
grave
and
i
bless
you
and
the
father
blessing
was
bestowed
on
each
all
i
possess
i
give
to
each
of
you
an
equal
share
with
my
blessing
you
are
my
offspring
and
the
representatives
of
your
father
on
earth
it
is
my
will
that
you
should
continue
as
you
have
begun
you
are
my
twelve
sons
and
i
have
no
other
your
brother
who
was
is
no
longer
we
have
waited
long
that
he
should
take
his
portion
and
my
blessing
but
he
has
tarried
elsewhere
and
now
the
hand
of
my
father
is
on
me
and
as
you
have
come
to
me
so
i
must
go
to
show
him
my
work
so
the
father
ordained
that
the
twelve
should
be
his
heirs
and
declared
that
any
one
coming
after
claiming
to
be
his
son
was
an
impostor
he
also
confirmed
in
the
existing
and
competent
courts
that
these
alone
were
his
representatives
on
earth
this
was
duly
registered
in
conformity
with
the
law
and
the
old
father
passed
away
to
rejoin
his
forefathers
the
twelve
sons
again
went
forth
into
the
world
and
carried
with
them
the
blessings
and
teachings
of
their
father
and
these
teachings
and
ideas
developed
and
grew
and
the
memory
of
their
father
was
cherished
and
blessed
many
years
after
a
person
turned
up
claiming
to
be
the
missing
son
and
sought
to
obtain
the
part
due
to
him
not
only
did
he
wish
his
share
but
he
claimed
the
whole
worldly
possessions
of
his
father
that
he
was
the
son
blessed
by
his
father
and
exhorted
all
to
follow
his
teachings
by
those
who
knew
the
circumstances
he
was
not
believed
but
many
were
ignorant
of
the
father
and
also
ignorant
of
the
registering
in
the
courts
of
law
and
were
inclined
to
believe
in
the
impostor
now
gentlemen
this
is
the
case
that
has
troubled
me
much
as
you
are
sitting
in
lawful
council
it
would
give
me
much
pleasure
if
you
could
cast
light
on
the
case
your
statement
will
help
me
and
i
will
be
ever
grateful
to
you
had
this
son
the
late
returned
person
any
right
to
all
the
worldly
possessions
of
the
father
or
in
fact
even
any
right
to
an
equal
share
thus
having
spoken
he
turned
to
the
hodjas
with
an
inquiring
look
they
one
and
all
unanimously
and
in
a
breath
said
that
all
the
legal
formalities
having
been
carried
out
the
will
of
the
father
was
law
and
the
law
he
passed
should
be
respected
therefore
the
thirteenth
son
was
an
impostor
on
returning
he
should
have
gone
to
his
brothers
and
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
received
as
a
brother
but
he
acted
otherwise
he
should
receive
nothing
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
look
at
it
in
that
light
and
i
will
now
say
that
that
has
always
been
my
opinion
but
your
statement
now
adds
strength
to
the
conviction
and
had
there
been
any
doubt
on
my
part
your
unanimous
declaration
would
have
dispelled
it
i
would
further
esteem
it
a
great
kindness
and
a
favor
if
as
a
reference
and
as
a
proof
of
my
authority
or
rather
as
a
corroboration
of
many
proofs
you
would
as
you
are
sitting
in
lawful
divan
give
your
signatures
to
the
effect
that
the
decision
of
the
learned
council
was
unanimous
and
to
this
said
effect
that
the
thirteenth
son
was
an
impostor
and
had
no
right
to
any
of
the
possessions
he
claimed
flattered
that
their
opinion
had
such
weight
the
judges
also
consented
to
do
this
and
the
patriarch
set
about
drawing
up
the
case
this
he
read
to
them
and
each
put
his
hand
and
seal
to
the
document
the
patriarch
thanked
them
and
departed
a
week
had
passed
and
the
judges
had
entirely
forgotten
the
case
that
had
been
put
to
them
but
they
had
not
forgotten
the
patriarch
and
eagerly
awaited
his
answer
to
their
question
which
left
no
alternative
and
which
would
cause
his
head
to
be
separated
from
his
body
by
a
blow
of
the
executioner
but
the
patriarch
did
not
make
his
appearance
and
as
the
prescribed
time
had
passed
the
judges
went
to
the
governor
to
see
what
steps
should
be
taken
the
governor
was
deeply
grieved
when
the
judges
told
him
of
the
terrible
question
they
had
put
to
the
patriarch
yet
remembering
leaving
that
morning
the
patriarch
who
had
been
with
him
and
who
seemed
in
no
wise
anxious
he
said
that
he
was
convinced
that
either
a
satisfactory
answer
had
been
given
or
would
be
forthcoming
he
questioned
the
hodjas
as
to
what
had
taken
place
and
they
answered
that
nothing
had
been
said
beyond
the
question
that
had
been
put
to
him
and
his
request
for
a
week
time
in
which
to
answer
did
he
say
nothing
at
all
asked
the
pasha
before
he
left
nothing
said
the
spokesman
of
the
judges
except
that
he
put
to
us
a
case
which
he
had
been
called
on
to
decide
and
asked
our
opinion
what
was
this
case
asked
the
pasha
and
the
judges
recited
it
to
him
told
what
opinion
they
had
given
and
stated
that
they
had
at
the
patriarch
request
and
for
his
use
placed
their
seal
to
this
opinion
go
home
you
heads
of
asses
said
the
governor
and
thank
allah
that
it
is
to
a
noble
and
a
great
man
who
would
make
no
unworthy
use
of
it
that
you
have
delivered
a
document
testifying
that
mohammed
is
an
impostor
in
future
venture
not
to
enter
into
judgment
with
men
whom
it
has
pleased
god
to
give
more
wit
than
to
yourselves
paradise
sold
by
the
yard
the
chief
imam
of
the
vilayet
of
broussa
owed
to
a
jew
the
sum
of
two
hundred
piasters
the
jew
wanted
his
money
and
would
give
no
rest
to
the
imam
daily
he
came
to
ask
for
it
but
without
success
the
jew
was
becoming
very
anxious
and
determined
to
make
a
great
effort
not
being
able
to
take
the
imam
to
court
he
decided
to
try
and
shame
him
into
paying
the
sum
due
and
to
effect
this
he
came
sat
on
his
debtor
doorstep
and
bewailed
his
sad
fate
in
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
tyrant
the
imam
saw
that
if
this
continued
his
reputation
as
a
man
of
justice
would
be
considerably
impaired
so
he
thought
of
a
plan
by
which
to
pay
off
his
creditor
calling
the
jew
into
his
house
he
said
friend
what
wilt
thou
do
with
the
money
if
i
pay
thee
get
food
clothe
my
children
and
advance
in
my
business
answered
the
jew
my
friend
said
the
imam
thy
pitiful
position
awakens
my
compassion
thou
art
gathering
wealth
in
this
world
at
the
cost
of
thy
soul
and
peace
in
the
world
to
come
and
i
wish
i
could
help
thee
i
will
tell
thee
what
i
will
do
for
thee
i
would
not
do
the
same
thing
for
any
other
jew
in
the
world
but
thou
hast
awakened
my
commiseration
for
the
debt
i
owe
thee
i
will
sell
thee
two
hundred
yards
of
paradise
and
being
owner
of
this
incomparable
possession
in
the
world
to
come
thou
canst
fearlessly
go
forth
and
earn
as
much
as
possible
in
this
world
having
already
made
ample
provision
for
the
next
what
could
the
jew
do
but
take
what
the
imam
was
willing
to
give
him
so
he
accepted
the
deed
for
the
two
hundred
yards
of
paradise
a
happy
thought
now
struck
the
jew
he
set
off
and
found
the
of
the
revenues
of
the
mosque
and
made
friends
with
him
he
then
explained
to
him
when
the
intimacy
had
developed
how
he
was
the
possessor
of
a
deed
entitling
him
to
two
hundred
yards
of
paradise
and
offered
the
collector
a
handsome
commission
if
he
would
help
him
in
disposing
of
it
when
the
money
had
been
gathered
for
the
quarter
the
collector
came
and
discounted
the
imam
document
returning
it
to
him
as
two
hundred
piasters
of
the
tithes
collected
with
the
statement
that
this
document
had
been
given
to
him
by
a
peasant
and
that
bearing
his
holy
seal
he
dared
not
refuse
it
the
imam
was
completely
deceived
and
thought
that
the
jew
had
sold
the
deed
at
a
discount
to
some
of
his
subjects
who
were
in
arrears
and
of
course
had
to
receive
it
as
being
as
good
as
gold
nevertheless
the
jew
was
not
forgotten
and
the
imam
determined
to
have
him
taken
into
court
and
sentenced
if
possible
his
charge
against
the
jew
was
that
he
the
chief
priest
of
the
province
had
taken
pity
on
this
jew
thinking
what
a
terrible
thing
it
was
to
know
no
future
and
as
the
man
hitherto
had
an
irreproachable
character
in
consideration
of
a
small
debt
he
had
against
the
church
which
it
was
desirable
to
balance
he
thought
he
would
give
this
jew
two
hundred
yards
of
paradise
which
he
did
now
gentlemen
this
ungrateful
dog
sold
this
valuable
document
and
it
was
brought
back
to
me
as
payment
of
taxes
in
arrears
due
to
the
church
therefore
i
say
that
this
jew
has
committed
a
great
sin
and
ought
to
be
punished
accordingly
the
cadis
now
turned
to
hear
the
jew
who
the
personification
of
meekness
stood
as
if
awaiting
his
death
sentence
with
the
most
innocent
look
possible
the
jew
replied
when
the
cadis
asked
him
what
he
had
to
say
for
himself
effendim
it
is
needless
to
say
how
i
appreciate
the
kindness
of
our
imam
but
the
reason
that
i
disposed
of
that
valuable
document
was
this
when
i
went
to
paradise
i
found
a
seat
and
measured
out
my
two
hundred
yards
and
took
possession
of
the
further
inside
end
of
the
bench
i
had
not
been
there
long
when
a
turk
came
and
sat
beside
me
i
showed
him
my
document
and
protested
against
his
taking
part
of
my
seat
but
gentlemen
i
assure
you
it
was
altogether
useless
the
turks
came
and
came
one
after
the
other
till
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
fell
off
at
the
other
end
of
the
seat
and
here
i
am
the
turks
in
paradise
will
take
no
heed
of
your
document
and
either
will
not
recognize
the
authority
of
the
imam
or
will
not
let
the
jews
enter
therein
effendim
what
could
i
do
but
come
back
and
sell
the
document
to
men
who
could
enter
paradise
and
this
i
did
the
cadis
after
consulting
gave
judgment
as
follows
we
note
that
you
could
not
have
done
anything
else
but
sell
the
two
hundred
yards
of
paradise
and
the
fact
that
you
can
not
enter
there
is
ample
punishment
for
the
wrong
committed
but
there
is
still
a
grievous
charge
against
you
which
if
you
can
clear
to
our
satisfaction
you
will
at
once
be
dismissed
how
much
did
the
document
cost
you
and
what
did
you
sell
it
for
effendim
it
cost
me
two
hundred
piasters
and
i
sold
it
for
two
hundred
piasters
this
statement
having
been
proved
by
producing
the
deed
in
question
and
the
who
had
given
it
to
the
imam
for
two
hundred
piasters
the
jew
was
acquitted
jew
turned
turk
sirkedji
the
on
the
stamboul
side
of
the
golden
horn
is
always
a
scene
of
bustle
and
noise
the
caiquedjis
striving
for
custom
cry
at
the
top
of
their
voices
i
am
bound
for
haskeuy
i
can
take
another
man
my
fare
is
a
piaster
others
call
in
lusty
tones
that
they
are
bound
for
karakeuy
further
out
in
the
stream
are
other
caiques
bound
for
more
distant
places
some
with
a
passenger
or
two
others
without
in
one
of
these
sat
a
jew
patiently
waiting
while
the
caiquedji
standing
erect
backed
in
and
out
every
now
and
then
calling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
meaning
that
he
was
bound
for
scutari
on
the
asiatic
shore
at
last
a
mussulman
signed
to
him
to
approach
and
inquired
his
fare
after
some
bargaining
the
turk
entered
the
caique
and
the
boatman
still
held
on
to
the
pier
in
the
hope
of
securing
a
third
passenger
which
after
a
very
short
time
he
did
the
third
passenger
happened
to
be
a
jew
who
had
forsaken
his
faith
for
that
of
islam
this
converted
individual
saw
at
a
glance
that
one
of
his
was
a
moslem
and
the
other
a
jew
and
wishing
to
gain
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
former
he
called
the
other
a
meaning
jew
but
usually
employed
as
a
term
of
disdain
and
told
him
to
make
room
for
him
this
the
jew
meekly
did
without
a
murmur
and
the
caiquedji
bent
his
oars
for
the
asiatic
shore
the
converted
jew
and
the
turk
started
a
conversation
which
they
kept
up
till
within
a
short
distance
of
scutari
when
the
turk
turned
and
said
to
the
jew
who
had
humbly
been
sitting
on
the
low
seat
with
bowed
head
and
closed
eyes
and
what
have
you
to
say
on
the
subject
moses
alas
pasha
effendi
answered
the
jew
i
have
been
asleep
and
have
not
followed
your
conversation
and
if
i
had
what
worth
could
my
opinion
be
i
a
poor
jew
the
converted
jew
then
said
at
least
you
can
tell
us
to
pass
the
time
where
you
have
been
in
your
sleep
and
he
burst
out
laughing
thinking
it
a
capital
joke
i
dreamt
i
was
in
paradise
replied
the
poor
jew
oh
it
was
wonderful
there
were
three
great
golden
gates
and
on
the
inside
at
the
side
of
the
keeper
of
each
gate
stood
mohammed
at
one
moses
at
the
other
and
jesus
at
the
third
no
one
was
allowed
to
pass
into
paradise
unless
mohammed
moses
or
jesus
gave
the
order
that
they
should
pass
at
mohammed
gate
a
man
knocked
and
on
being
opened
the
keeper
asked
is
your
name
to
which
he
replied
your
father
name
again
asked
the
keeper
and
the
prophet
signed
with
his
hand
that
he
might
enter
i
then
went
to
the
gate
where
jesus
stood
and
heard
the
same
questions
put
to
an
applicant
he
told
the
keeper
that
his
name
was
aristide
and
that
his
father
name
was
vassili
and
jesus
permitted
him
to
enter
hearing
a
loud
knocking
at
mohammed
gate
again
i
hurried
to
see
who
the
important
comer
was
there
stood
a
man
of
confident
mien
who
proudly
answered
that
his
name
was
hussein
effendi
your
father
name
asked
the
keeper
replied
hussein
at
this
mohammed
said
the
door
you
ca
enter
here
mixtures
will
not
do
eh
what
happened
next
asked
the
turk
just
then
as
the
gate
was
shutting
i
heard
your
voice
and
i
awoke
pasha
effendi
answered
the
jew
and
so
i
ca
tell
you
and
as
they
approached
the
scala
landing
they
disembarked
at
scutari
and
separated
without
a
word
the
metamorphosis
hussein
agha
was
much
troubled
in
spirit
and
mind
he
had
saved
a
large
sum
of
money
in
order
that
he
might
make
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
what
troubled
him
was
that
after
having
carefully
provided
for
all
the
expenses
of
this
long
journey
there
still
remained
a
few
hundred
piasters
over
and
above
what
was
he
to
do
with
these
true
they
could
be
distributed
amongst
the
poor
but
then
might
not
he
on
his
return
require
the
money
for
even
a
more
meritorious
purpose
after
much
consideration
he
decided
that
it
was
not
allah
wish
that
he
should
at
once
give
this
money
in
charity
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
convinced
that
he
should
not
give
it
to
a
brother
for
safe
keeping
as
he
might
be
inspired
during
hussein
pilgrimage
to
spend
it
on
some
charitable
purpose
after
a
time
he
thought
of
a
kindly
jew
who
was
his
neighbor
and
decided
to
leave
his
savings
in
the
hands
of
this
man
to
whom
allah
had
been
good
seeing
that
his
possessions
were
great
after
mature
thought
he
decided
not
to
put
temptation
in
the
way
of
his
neighbor
he
therefore
secured
a
jar
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
placed
a
small
bag
containing
his
surplus
of
wealth
and
filled
it
with
olives
this
he
carried
to
his
neighbor
and
begged
him
to
take
care
of
it
for
him
ben
moÃ¯se
of
course
consented
and
hussein
agha
departed
on
his
pilgrimage
contented
on
his
return
from
the
holy
land
hussein
now
a
hadji
repaired
to
ben
moÃ¯se
and
asked
for
his
jar
of
olives
and
at
the
same
time
presented
ben
moÃ¯se
with
a
rosary
of
yemen
stones
in
recognition
of
the
service
rendered
him
in
the
safe
keeping
of
the
olives
which
he
said
were
exceptionally
palatable
ben
moÃ¯se
thanked
him
and
hadji
hussein
departed
with
his
jar
well
satisfied
during
the
absence
of
hussein
agha
it
happened
that
ben
moÃ¯se
had
some
distinguished
visitors
to
whom
as
is
the
eastern
custom
he
served
raki
unfortunately
however
he
had
no
mÃ©zÃ©
appetizer
to
offer
as
is
also
the
custom
in
the
east
ben
moÃ¯se
bethought
him
of
the
olives
and
immediately
went
to
the
cellar
opened
the
jar
and
extracted
some
of
them
saying
olives
are
not
rare
hussein
will
never
know
the
difference
if
i
replace
them
the
olives
were
found
excellent
and
ben
moÃ¯se
again
and
again
helped
his
friends
to
them
great
was
his
surprise
when
he
found
that
instead
of
olives
he
brought
forth
a
bag
containing
a
quantity
of
gold
ben
moÃ¯se
could
not
understand
this
phenomenon
but
appropriated
the
gold
and
held
his
peace
arriving
home
poor
hussein
agha
was
distracted
to
find
that
his
jar
contained
nothing
but
olives
vainly
did
he
protest
to
ben
moÃ¯se
my
friend
he
would
reply
you
gave
me
the
jar
saying
it
contained
olives
i
believed
you
and
kept
the
jar
safe
for
you
now
you
say
that
in
the
jar
you
had
put
some
money
together
with
the
olives
perhaps
you
did
but
is
not
that
the
jar
you
gave
me
if
as
you
say
there
was
gold
in
the
jar
and
it
is
now
gone
all
i
can
say
is
the
stronger
has
overcome
the
weaker
and
that
in
this
case
the
gold
has
either
been
converted
into
olives
or
into
oil
what
can
i
do
the
jar
you
gave
me
i
returned
to
you
hadji
hussein
admitted
this
and
fully
appreciated
that
he
had
no
case
against
the
jew
so
saying
shai
he
returned
to
his
home
that
night
hussein
mingled
in
his
prayers
a
vow
to
recover
his
gold
at
no
matter
what
cost
or
trouble
in
his
younger
days
hadji
hussein
had
been
a
and
many
were
the
chibooks
of
exceptional
beauty
that
he
had
made
go
but
to
the
potters
lane
at
tophane
and
the
works
of
art
displayed
by
the
majority
of
them
have
been
fashioned
by
the
hands
of
hussein
the
art
that
had
fed
him
for
years
was
now
to
be
the
means
of
recovering
his
money
hadji
hussein
daily
met
ben
moÃ¯se
but
he
never
again
referred
to
the
money
and
further
hussein
sons
were
always
in
company
with
ben
moÃ¯se
only
son
a
lad
of
ten
time
passed
and
ben
moÃ¯se
entirely
forgot
about
the
jar
olives
and
gold
not
so
hadji
hussein
he
had
been
working
first
he
had
made
an
effigy
of
ben
moÃ¯se
when
he
had
completed
this
image
to
his
satisfaction
he
dressed
it
in
the
identical
manner
and
costume
the
jew
habitually
wore
he
then
purchased
a
monkey
this
monkey
was
kept
in
a
cage
opposite
the
effigy
of
ben
moÃ¯se
twice
a
day
regularly
the
monkey
food
was
placed
on
the
shoulders
of
the
jew
and
hussein
would
open
the
cage
saying
babai
git
go
to
your
father
at
a
bound
the
monkey
would
plant
himself
on
the
shoulders
of
the
jew
and
would
not
be
dislodged
until
its
hunger
had
been
satisfied
in
the
meantime
hadji
hussein
and
ben
moÃ¯se
were
greater
friends
than
ever
and
their
children
were
likewise
playmates
one
day
hussein
took
ben
moÃ¯se
son
to
his
harem
and
told
him
much
to
the
lad
joy
that
he
was
to
be
their
guest
for
a
week
later
on
ben
moÃ¯se
called
on
hadji
hussein
to
know
the
reason
of
his
son
not
returning
as
usual
at
sundown
ah
my
friend
said
hussein
a
great
calamity
has
befallen
you
your
son
alas
has
been
converted
into
a
monkey
a
furious
monkey
so
furious
that
i
was
compelled
to
put
him
into
a
cage
come
and
see
for
yourself
no
sooner
did
ben
moÃ¯se
enter
the
room
in
which
the
caged
monkey
was
than
it
set
up
a
howl
not
having
had
any
food
that
day
poor
ben
moÃ¯se
was
thunderstruck
and
hadji
hussein
begged
him
to
take
the
monkey
away
next
day
hussein
was
summoned
to
the
court
the
case
of
ben
moÃ¯se
was
heard
and
the
hadji
was
ordered
to
return
the
child
at
once
this
he
vowed
he
could
not
do
and
to
convince
the
judges
he
offered
to
bring
the
monkey
caged
as
it
was
to
the
court
and
inshallah
they
would
see
for
themselves
that
the
child
of
the
jew
had
been
converted
into
a
monkey
this
was
ultimately
agreed
to
and
the
monkey
was
brought
hadji
hussein
took
special
care
to
place
the
cage
opposite
ben
moÃ¯se
and
no
sooner
did
the
monkey
catch
sight
of
him
than
it
set
up
a
scream
and
the
judges
said
shai
hussein
agha
then
opened
the
cage
door
saying
go
to
your
father
and
the
monkey
with
a
bound
and
a
yell
embraced
ben
moÃ¯se
putting
his
head
in
search
of
food
first
on
one
shoulder
of
the
jew
and
then
on
the
other
the
judges
were
thunderstruck
and
declared
their
incompetency
to
give
judgment
in
such
a
case
ben
moÃ¯se
protested
saying
that
it
was
against
the
laws
of
nature
for
such
a
metamorphosis
to
take
place
whereupon
hadji
hussein
told
the
judges
of
an
analogous
instance
of
some
gold
pieces
turning
into
olives
and
called
upon
ben
moÃ¯se
to
witness
the
veracity
of
his
statement
the
judges
much
perplexed
dismissed
the
case
declaring
that
provision
had
not
been
made
in
the
law
for
it
and
there
being
no
precedent
to
their
knowledge
they
were
incompetent
to
give
judgment
leaving
the
court
hadji
hussein
informed
ben
moÃ¯se
that
there
would
still
be
pleasure
and
happiness
in
this
world
for
him
provided
he
could
reconvert
the
olives
into
gold
needless
to
add
that
ben
moÃ¯se
handed
the
money
to
hadji
hussein
and
the
heir
of
ben
moÃ¯se
returned
to
his
home
none
the
worse
for
his
transformation
the
calif
omar
the
calif
omar
one
of
the
first
califs
after
the
prophet
is
deeply
venerated
to
this
day
and
is
continually
quoted
as
a
lover
of
truth
and
justice
often
in
the
face
of
appalling
evidence
he
refrained
from
judgment
thus
liberating
the
innocent
and
punishing
the
guilty
the
following
is
given
as
an
example
of
his
perseverance
in
fathoming
a
murder
at
the
feast
of
the
passover
a
certain
jew
of
bagdad
had
sacrificed
his
sheep
and
was
offering
up
his
prayers
when
suddenly
a
dog
came
in
and
snatching
up
the
sheep
head
ran
off
with
it
the
jew
pursued
in
hot
haste
in
his
excitement
still
carrying
the
bloody
knife
and
wearing
his
besmeared
apron
the
dog
carrying
the
sheep
head
rushed
into
an
open
doorway
followed
closely
by
the
jew
the
jew
in
his
hurried
pursuit
fell
over
the
body
of
what
proved
to
be
a
murdered
man
the
murder
was
laid
against
the
jew
and
witnesses
swore
that
they
had
seen
him
coming
out
of
the
house
covered
with
blood
and
in
his
hand
a
bloody
dagger
the
jew
was
arrested
and
tried
but
with
covered
head
he
swore
by
his
forefathers
and
children
that
he
was
innocent
omar
would
not
condemn
him
as
none
of
the
witnesses
had
seen
the
jew
do
the
deed
and
until
further
evidence
had
been
given
to
prove
his
guilt
the
case
was
adjourned
spies
and
detectives
unknown
to
anybody
were
put
to
track
the
murderers
after
a
time
they
were
discovered
condemned
put
to
death
and
the
jew
liberated
kalaidji
avram
of
balata
balata
situated
on
the
golden
horn
is
mostly
inhabited
by
jews
of
the
poorer
classes
who
make
their
livelihood
as
tinsmiths
tinkers
and
hawkers
here
in
the
early
days
when
the
janissaries
flourished
there
lived
a
certain
tinsmith
called
kalaidji
avram
having
rather
an
extensive
business
his
neighbors
especially
those
who
lived
nearest
were
always
complaining
of
the
annoying
smoke
and
disagreeable
odor
of
ammonia
which
he
used
in
tinning
his
pots
and
pans
opposite
avram
place
the
village
was
situated
and
the
chief
a
janissary
often
had
disputes
with
avram
about
the
smoke
avram
would
invariably
reply
i
have
my
children
to
feed
and
i
must
work
and
without
smoke
i
can
not
earn
their
daily
bread
the
janissary
much
annoyed
cultivated
a
dislike
for
avram
and
a
thirst
for
revenge
it
happened
that
a
jew
one
day
came
to
the
janissary
and
said
to
him
do
you
want
to
make
a
fortune
if
so
you
have
the
means
of
doing
this
provided
you
will
agree
to
halve
with
me
whatever
is
made
the
janissary
on
being
assured
that
he
had
but
to
say
a
word
or
two
to
a
person
he
would
designate
and
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
accepted
the
conditions
the
jew
then
said
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
go
up
to
a
jewish
funeral
procession
that
will
pass
by
here
on
its
way
to
the
necropolis
outside
the
city
and
order
it
to
stop
it
is
against
the
religion
of
the
jews
for
such
a
thing
to
happen
and
the
chacham
rabbi
will
offer
you
first
ten
then
twenty
and
finally
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
piasters
to
allow
the
funeral
to
proceed
the
half
will
be
for
you
to
compensate
you
for
your
trouble
and
the
other
thousand
piasters
for
me
this
as
the
jew
had
told
him
seemed
very
simple
to
the
janissary
the
next
day
true
enough
he
beheld
a
funeral
and
immediately
went
out
and
ordered
it
to
stop
the
chacham
protested
offering
first
small
bribes
then
larger
and
larger
till
ultimately
he
promised
to
bring
to
the
worthy
captain
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
piasters
for
allowing
the
funeral
to
proceed
that
evening
as
agreed
the
chacham
came
and
handed
the
money
to
the
captain
of
the
janissaries
then
taking
another
bag
containing
a
second
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
piasters
he
said
if
you
will
tell
me
who
informed
you
that
we
would
pay
so
much
money
rather
than
have
a
funeral
stopped
you
can
have
this
further
sum
the
janissary
immediately
bethought
him
of
avram
the
tinsmith
and
accused
him
as
his
informant
and
the
chacham
satisfied
paid
the
sum
and
departed
avram
disappeared
nobody
knew
where
the
chacham
said
that
death
had
taken
him
for
his
own
as
a
punishment
for
stopping
him
while
on
a
journey
the
accomplice
of
the
janissary
came
a
few
days
later
for
his
share
of
the
money
the
janissary
handed
him
the
thousand
piasters
and
at
the
same
time
said
of
these
thousand
piasters
thirty
thousand
must
be
given
to
the
widow
and
children
of
avram
and
i
advise
you
to
give
it
willingly
for
avram
has
taken
your
place
how
mehmet
ali
pasha
of
egypt
administered
justice
a
jewish
merchant
was
in
the
habit
of
borrowing
and
sometimes
of
lending
money
to
an
armenian
merchant
of
cairo
receipts
were
never
exchanged
but
at
the
closing
of
an
old
account
or
the
opening
of
a
new
one
they
would
simply
say
to
each
other
i
have
debited
or
credited
you
in
my
books
as
the
case
might
be
with
so
much
on
one
occasion
the
armenian
lent
the
jew
the
sum
of
thousand
piasters
and
after
the
usual
verbal
acknowledgment
the
armenian
made
his
entry
a
reasonable
time
having
elapsed
the
armenian
sent
his
greetings
to
the
jew
this
in
eastern
etiquette
meant
pay
me
what
you
owe
the
jew
however
did
not
take
the
hint
but
returned
complimentary
greetings
to
the
armenian
this
was
repeated
several
times
finally
the
armenian
sent
a
message
requesting
the
jew
to
call
upon
him
the
jew
however
told
the
messenger
to
inform
the
armenian
merchant
that
if
he
wished
to
see
him
he
must
come
to
his
house
the
armenian
called
upon
the
jew
and
requested
payment
of
the
loan
the
jew
brought
out
his
books
and
showed
the
armenian
that
he
was
both
credited
and
debited
with
the
sum
of
thousand
piasters
the
armenian
protested
but
in
vain
the
jew
maintained
that
the
debt
had
been
paid
in
the
hope
of
recovering
his
money
the
armenian
had
the
case
brought
before
mehmet
ali
pasha
of
egypt
a
clever
and
learned
judge
no
witnesses
however
could
be
cited
to
prove
that
the
money
had
either
been
borrowed
or
repaid
the
entries
were
verified
and
it
was
thought
that
perhaps
the
armenian
had
forgotten
before
dismissing
the
case
however
mehmet
ali
pasha
called
in
the
public
weigher
and
ordered
that
both
the
armenian
and
jewish
merchants
be
weighed
this
done
mehmet
ali
pasha
took
note
of
their
respective
weights
the
jew
weighed
fifty
okes
and
the
armenian
sixty
okes
he
then
discharged
them
saying
that
he
would
send
for
them
later
on
the
armenian
waited
patiently
for
a
month
or
two
but
no
summons
came
from
the
pasha
every
friday
he
endeavored
to
meet
the
pasha
so
as
to
bring
the
case
to
his
mind
but
without
avail
for
the
pasha
perceiving
him
from
a
distance
would
turn
away
his
head
or
otherwise
purposely
avoid
catching
his
eye
at
last
after
about
eight
months
of
anxious
waiting
the
armenian
and
the
jew
were
summoned
to
appear
before
the
court
mehmet
ali
pasha
in
opening
the
case
called
in
the
public
weigher
and
had
them
weighed
again
on
this
occasion
it
was
found
that
the
armenian
had
decreased
now
only
weighing
fifty
okes
for
worry
makes
a
man
grow
thin
but
the
jew
on
the
contrary
had
put
on
several
okes
these
facts
were
gravely
considered
and
the
pasha
accused
the
jew
of
having
received
the
money
and
at
once
ordered
the
brass
pot
to
be
heated
and
placed
on
his
head
to
force
confession
the
jew
did
not
care
to
submit
to
this
fearful
ordeal
so
he
confessed
that
he
had
not
repaid
the
debt
and
had
to
do
so
then
and
there
how
the
farmer
learned
to
cure
his
wife
a
turkish
Ã¦sop
there
once
lived
a
farmer
who
understood
the
language
of
animals
he
had
obtained
this
knowledge
on
condition
that
he
would
never
reveal
its
possession
and
with
the
further
provision
that
should
he
prove
false
to
his
oath
the
penalty
would
be
certain
death
one
day
he
chanced
to
listen
to
a
conversation
his
ox
and
his
horse
were
having
the
ox
had
just
come
in
from
a
weary
and
hard
day
work
in
the
rain
oh
sighed
the
ox
looking
over
to
the
horse
how
fortunate
you
are
to
have
been
born
a
horse
and
not
an
ox
when
the
weather
is
bad
you
are
kept
in
the
stable
well
fed
groomed
every
morning
and
caressed
every
evening
oh
that
i
were
a
horse
what
you
say
is
true
replied
the
horse
but
you
are
very
stupid
to
work
so
hard
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
be
goaded
with
a
spear
and
howled
at
or
you
would
not
accuse
me
of
being
stupid
to
work
so
hard
replied
the
ox
then
why
do
you
feign
sickness
continued
the
horse
on
the
following
day
the
ox
determined
to
try
this
deceit
but
he
was
stung
with
remorse
when
he
saw
the
horse
led
out
to
take
his
place
at
the
plough
in
the
evening
when
the
horse
was
brought
to
the
stable
very
tired
the
ox
sympathized
with
him
and
regretted
his
being
the
cause
but
at
the
same
time
expressed
astonishment
at
his
working
so
hard
ah
my
friend
i
had
to
work
hard
i
ca
bear
the
whip
the
thought
of
the
hideous
crack
crack
makes
me
shiver
even
now
answered
the
horse
but
leaving
that
aside
my
poor
horned
friend
proceeded
the
horse
i
am
now
most
anxious
for
you
i
heard
the
master
say
that
if
you
were
not
well
in
the
morning
the
butcher
was
to
come
and
slaughter
you
you
need
not
worry
about
me
friend
horse
said
the
ox
as
i
much
prefer
the
yoke
to
chewing
the
cud
of
at
this
point
the
farmer
left
the
animals
and
entered
his
home
smiling
at
his
own
wily
craft
in
if
not
contentedness
at
least
resignation
to
their
fate
in
the
stable
meeting
his
wife
she
at
once
inquired
as
to
the
cause
of
his
happy
smile
he
put
her
off
first
with
one
excuse
then
with
another
but
to
no
avail
the
more
he
protested
the
stronger
her
inquisitiveness
grew
her
unsatisfied
curiosity
at
length
made
her
ill
the
endeavors
of
the
numerous
doctors
brought
to
her
assistance
were
as
futile
as
the
incantations
of
the
sages
from
far
and
near
and
as
powerless
to
remove
the
spell
as
were
the
amulets
the
charms
and
the
abracadabras
conceived
and
written
by
holy
men
the
evil
prompting
gnawed
her
and
she
visibly
pined
away
the
poor
farmer
was
distracted
rather
than
see
her
die
he
at
last
decided
to
tell
her
and
forfeit
his
own
life
to
save
hers
deeply
dejected
for
no
man
quits
this
planet
without
a
pang
he
sat
at
the
window
gazing
as
he
thought
for
the
last
time
on
the
familiar
surroundings
of
a
sudden
he
noticed
his
favorite
chanticleer
followed
by
his
numerous
harem
sadly
strutting
about
only
allowing
his
favorites
to
eat
the
morsels
he
discovered
and
ruthlessly
driving
the
others
away
to
one
he
said
i
am
not
like
our
poor
master
to
be
ruled
by
one
or
a
score
of
you
he
poor
man
will
die
for
revealing
his
secret
knowledge
to
save
her
life
what
is
the
secret
knowledge
asked
one
of
the
wives
and
the
chanticleer
flew
at
her
and
thrashed
her
mercilessly
saying
at
each
vigorous
blow
that
is
the
secret
and
if
our
master
only
treated
the
mistress
as
i
treat
you
he
would
not
need
to
give
up
his
life
and
as
if
maddened
at
the
thought
he
beat
them
all
in
turn
the
master
seeing
and
appreciating
the
effect
from
the
window
went
to
his
wife
and
treated
her
in
precisely
the
same
manner
and
this
effected
what
neither
doctors
sages
nor
holy
men
could
do
it
cured
her
the
language
of
birds
there
once
lived
a
hodja
who
it
was
said
understood
the
language
of
birds
but
refused
to
impart
his
knowledge
one
young
man
was
very
persistent
in
his
desire
to
know
the
language
of
these
sweet
creatures
but
the
hodja
was
inflexible
in
despair
the
young
man
went
to
the
woods
at
least
to
listen
to
the
pleasant
chirping
of
the
birds
by
degrees
it
conveyed
to
him
a
meaning
till
finally
he
understood
them
to
tell
him
that
his
horse
would
die
on
returning
from
the
woods
he
immediately
sold
his
horse
and
went
and
told
the
hodja
oh
hodja
why
will
you
not
teach
me
the
language
of
birds
yesterday
i
went
to
the
woods
and
they
warned
me
that
my
horse
would
die
thus
affording
me
an
opportunity
of
selling
it
and
avoiding
the
loss
the
hodja
was
silent
but
would
not
give
way
the
following
day
the
young
man
again
went
to
the
woods
and
the
chirping
of
the
birds
told
him
that
his
house
would
be
burned
the
young
man
hurried
away
sold
his
house
again
went
to
the
hodja
and
told
him
all
that
had
happened
adding
see
hodja
effendi
you
would
not
teach
me
the
language
of
the
birds
but
i
have
saved
my
horse
and
my
house
by
listening
to
them
on
the
following
day
the
young
man
again
went
to
the
woods
and
the
birds
chirped
him
the
doleful
tale
that
on
the
following
day
he
would
die
in
tears
the
young
man
went
to
the
hodja
for
advice
oh
hodja
effendi
alas
what
am
i
to
do
the
birds
have
told
me
that
i
must
die
my
son
answered
the
hodja
i
knew
this
would
come
and
that
is
why
i
refused
to
teach
you
the
language
of
birds
had
you
borne
the
loss
of
your
horse
your
house
would
have
been
saved
and
had
your
house
been
burned
your
life
would
have
been
saved
the
swallow
advice
a
man
one
day
saw
a
swallow
and
caught
it
the
bird
pleaded
hard
for
liberty
saying
if
thou
wilt
let
me
go
thy
gain
will
be
great
for
i
will
give
thee
three
counsels
that
will
hereafter
be
of
use
to
thee
the
man
listened
to
the
bird
and
let
it
go
flying
to
a
tree
close
by
it
perched
on
a
branch
and
said
hearken
and
give
thine
ear
to
the
three
advices
that
will
guide
thee
the
first
is
do
not
believe
things
that
are
incredible
the
second
is
do
not
attempt
to
stretch
out
thine
hand
to
a
place
thou
art
unable
to
reach
and
the
third
advice
i
give
thee
is
do
not
pine
after
a
thing
that
is
past
and
gone
take
these
my
counsels
and
do
not
forget
them
the
bird
then
tempted
the
man
saying
inside
of
me
there
is
a
large
pearl
of
great
value
it
is
both
magnificent
and
splendid
and
as
large
as
the
egg
of
a
kite
now
hearing
this
the
man
repented
at
having
let
the
bird
go
the
color
of
his
face
went
to
sadness
and
he
at
once
stretched
out
his
hand
to
catch
the
swallow
but
the
latter
said
to
the
foolish
man
what
hast
thou
already
forgotten
the
advice
i
gave
thee
and
the
lie
which
i
told
thee
hast
thou
considered
as
true
i
had
fallen
into
thy
hands
yet
thou
wert
unable
to
retain
me
and
now
thou
art
sorrowing
for
the
past
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
such
are
those
that
worship
idols
and
give
the
name
of
god
to
their
own
handiwork
they
have
left
aside
god
almighty
and
have
forgotten
the
great
bestower
of
all
good
gifts
we
know
not
what
the
dawn
may
bring
forth
in
the
age
of
the
janissaries
the
minister
of
war
in
all
haste
called
the
chief
farrier
of
the
army
and
ordered
him
to
have
made
immediately
two
hundred
thousand
horseshoes
the
farrier
was
aghast
and
explained
that
to
make
such
a
quantity
of
horseshoes
both
time
and
smiths
would
be
required
the
minister
replied
it
is
the
order
of
his
majesty
that
these
two
hundred
thousand
horseshoes
be
ready
by
if
not
your
head
will
pay
the
penalty
the
poor
farrier
replied
that
knowing
now
that
he
was
doomed
he
would
be
unable
through
nervousness
to
make
even
a
fifth
of
the
number
the
minister
would
not
listen
to
reason
and
left
in
anger
reiterating
the
order
of
his
majesty
the
farrier
retired
to
his
rooms
deeply
dejected
his
wife
endeavored
to
encourage
and
comfort
him
saying
cheer
up
husband
drink
your
raki
eat
your
mÃ©zÃ©
and
be
cheerful
for
we
know
not
what
the
dawn
may
bring
forth
ah
said
the
farrier
the
dawn
will
not
bring
forth
two
hundred
thousand
horseshoes
and
my
head
will
pay
the
penalty
late
that
night
there
was
a
tremendous
knocking
at
his
door
the
poor
farrier
thought
that
it
was
an
inquiry
as
to
how
many
horseshoes
were
already
made
and
trembling
with
fear
went
and
opened
the
door
what
was
his
surprise
when
on
opening
the
door
and
inquiring
the
object
of
the
visit
to
be
greeted
with
haste
farrier
let
us
have
sixteen
nails
for
the
minister
of
war
has
been
suddenly
removed
to
paradise
by
the
hand
of
allah
the
farrier
gathered
not
sixteen
but
forty
nails
of
the
best
he
had
and
handing
them
to
the
messenger
said
nail
him
down
well
friend
so
that
he
will
not
get
up
again
for
had
not
this
happened
the
nails
would
have
been
required
to
keep
me
in
my
coffin
old
men
made
young
in
psamatia
an
ancient
armenian
village
situated
near
the
seven
towers
there
lived
a
certain
smith
whose
custom
it
was
in
contradiction
to
prescribed
rules
to
curse
the
devil
and
his
works
regularly
five
times
a
day
instead
of
praying
to
god
he
argued
that
it
is
the
devil
fault
that
man
had
need
to
pray
the
devil
was
angered
at
being
thus
persistently
cursed
and
decided
to
punish
the
smith
or
at
least
prevent
his
causing
further
trouble
taking
the
form
of
a
young
man
he
went
to
the
smith
and
engaged
himself
as
an
apprentice
after
a
time
the
devil
told
the
smith
that
he
had
a
very
poor
and
mean
way
of
earning
a
living
and
that
he
would
show
him
how
money
was
to
be
made
the
smith
asked
what
he
a
young
apprentice
could
do
thereupon
the
devil
told
him
that
he
was
endowed
with
a
great
gift
the
power
to
make
old
men
young
again
though
incredulous
after
continued
assurance
the
smith
allowed
a
sign
to
be
put
above
his
door
stating
that
aged
people
could
here
be
restored
to
youth
this
extraordinary
sign
attracted
a
great
many
but
the
devil
asked
such
high
prices
that
most
went
away
preferring
age
to
parting
with
so
much
money
at
last
one
old
man
agreed
to
pay
the
sum
demanded
by
the
devil
whereupon
he
was
promptly
cast
into
the
furnace
the
blowing
the
bellows
for
a
small
remuneration
after
a
time
of
vigorous
blowing
the
devil
raked
out
a
young
man
the
fame
of
the
smith
extended
far
and
wide
and
many
were
the
aged
that
came
to
regain
their
youth
this
lucrative
business
went
on
for
some
time
and
at
last
the
smith
thinking
to
himself
that
it
was
not
a
difficult
thing
to
throw
a
man
into
the
furnace
and
rake
him
out
from
the
ashes
restored
to
youth
decided
to
do
away
with
his
apprentice
services
but
kept
the
sign
above
the
door
it
happened
that
the
captain
of
the
janissaries
who
was
a
very
aged
man
came
to
him
and
after
bargaining
for
a
much
more
modest
sum
than
his
apprentice
would
have
asked
the
smith
thrust
him
into
the
furnace
as
the
devil
his
apprentice
used
to
do
and
worked
at
the
bellows
he
afterwards
raked
in
the
fire
for
the
young
man
but
he
only
raked
out
cinders
and
ashes
great
was
his
consternation
but
what
could
he
do
the
devil
in
the
meantime
went
to
the
head
of
the
janissaries
and
the
police
and
informed
them
of
what
had
taken
place
the
poor
smith
was
arrested
tried
and
condemned
to
be
bowstrung
as
it
was
proved
that
the
janissary
was
last
seen
to
enter
his
shop
just
as
the
smith
was
about
to
be
executed
the
devil
again
appeared
before
him
in
the
form
of
the
discharged
apprentice
and
asked
him
if
he
wished
to
be
saved
if
so
that
he
could
save
him
but
on
one
condition
only
that
he
ceased
from
cursing
the
devil
five
times
a
day
and
pray
as
other
mussulmans
prayed
he
agreed
thereupon
the
apprentice
called
in
a
loud
voice
to
those
who
were
about
to
execute
him
what
will
you
of
this
man
he
has
not
killed
the
janissary
he
is
not
dead
for
i
have
just
seen
him
entering
his
home
this
was
found
to
be
true
and
the
smith
was
liberated
learning
the
truth
of
the
proverb
not
even
the
devil
the
bribe
there
once
lived
in
stamboul
a
man
and
wife
who
were
so
well
mated
that
though
married
for
a
number
of
years
their
life
was
one
of
ideal
harmony
this
troubled
the
devil
very
much
he
had
destroyed
the
peace
of
home
after
home
he
had
successfully
created
between
husband
and
wife
father
and
son
and
brothers
the
chasm
of
envy
wide
and
deep
so
wide
that
the
bridge
of
life
could
not
span
the
gap
in
this
one
little
home
alone
did
he
fail
in
spite
of
his
greatest
endeavor
one
day
the
devil
was
talking
to
an
old
woman
when
the
man
who
had
thus
far
baffled
him
passed
by
the
devil
groaned
at
the
thought
of
his
repeated
failures
turning
to
the
old
woman
he
said
i
will
give
you
as
a
reward
a
pair
of
yellow
slippers
if
you
make
that
man
quarrel
with
his
wife
the
old
woman
was
delighted
and
at
once
began
to
scheme
and
work
for
the
coveted
slippers
at
an
hour
when
she
was
sure
to
find
the
lady
alone
she
went
and
solicited
alms
weeping
and
bemoaning
her
sad
fate
at
being
a
lonely
old
woman
whose
husband
was
long
since
dead
she
appealed
to
the
lady
for
compassion
in
proportion
as
she
hoped
for
the
duration
of
the
cup
she
and
her
husband
quaffed
in
undivided
happiness
the
lady
was
very
generous
to
the
old
woman
each
day
giving
her
something
so
much
so
that
the
thought
that
her
good
husband
might
think
her
extravagant
often
gave
her
some
uneasiness
one
day
the
old
woman
looked
into
the
of
her
husband
and
planted
the
first
evil
seed
by
calling
out
ah
if
men
only
knew
where
the
money
they
work
for
from
morning
till
night
goes
or
knew
what
their
wives
did
when
they
were
away
some
homes
would
not
be
so
happy
the
evil
woman
then
went
her
way
and
the
good
shopman
wondered
why
she
had
said
these
words
to
him
a
passing
thought
suggested
that
it
was
strange
that
of
late
his
wife
had
asked
him
several
times
for
a
few
extra
piasters
the
next
day
the
old
woman
as
usual
solicited
alms
of
her
victim
in
the
fulness
of
her
hypocrisy
she
embraced
the
young
lady
before
departing
taking
care
to
leave
the
imprint
of
her
blackened
hand
on
her
dupe
back
the
old
woman
then
again
went
to
the
shop
looked
at
her
victim
husband
and
said
oh
how
blind
men
are
they
only
look
in
a
woman
face
for
truth
and
loyalty
they
forget
to
look
at
the
back
where
the
stamp
of
the
lover
hand
is
to
be
seen
as
before
the
old
woman
disappeared
but
the
mind
of
the
shopman
was
troubled
and
his
heart
was
heavy
in
this
oppressed
state
he
went
to
his
home
and
an
opportunity
offering
he
looked
at
his
wife
back
and
was
aghast
to
see
there
the
impression
of
a
hand
he
got
up
and
left
his
home
a
man
the
devil
was
deeply
impressed
at
the
signal
success
of
the
old
woman
and
hastened
to
redeem
his
promise
he
took
a
long
pole
tied
the
pair
of
slippers
at
the
end
and
hurried
off
to
the
old
woman
arriving
at
her
house
he
called
out
to
her
to
open
the
window
when
she
did
this
he
thrust
in
the
pair
of
yellow
slippers
begging
her
to
take
them
but
not
to
come
near
him
they
were
slippers
he
said
she
had
succeeded
where
he
had
failed
so
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
and
was
anxious
to
keep
out
of
her
way
how
the
devil
lost
his
wager
a
peasant
ploughing
his
field
was
panting
with
fatigue
when
the
devil
appeared
before
him
and
said
oh
poor
man
you
complain
of
your
lot
and
with
justice
for
your
labor
is
not
that
of
a
man
but
is
as
heavy
as
that
of
a
beast
of
burden
now
i
have
made
a
wager
that
i
shall
find
a
contented
man
so
give
me
the
handle
of
your
plough
and
the
goad
of
your
oxen
that
i
may
do
the
work
for
you
the
peasant
consenting
the
devil
touched
the
oxen
and
in
one
turn
of
the
plough
all
the
furrows
of
the
field
were
opened
up
and
the
work
finished
is
it
well
done
asked
the
devil
yes
replied
the
man
but
seed
is
very
dear
this
year
in
answer
to
this
the
devil
shook
his
long
tail
in
the
air
and
lo
little
seeds
began
to
fall
like
hail
from
the
sky
i
hope
said
the
devil
that
i
have
gained
my
wager
bah
answered
the
peasant
what
the
good
of
that
these
seeds
might
be
lost
you
do
not
take
into
consideration
frost
blighting
winds
drought
damp
storms
diseases
of
plants
and
other
things
how
can
i
judge
as
yet
behold
said
the
devil
in
this
box
are
both
sun
and
rain
take
it
and
use
it
as
you
please
the
peasant
did
so
and
to
very
good
purpose
for
his
corn
soon
ripened
and
up
to
that
time
he
had
never
seen
so
good
a
harvest
but
the
corn
of
his
neighbors
had
also
prospered
from
the
rain
and
sun
at
harvest
time
the
devil
came
and
saw
that
the
man
was
looking
with
envious
eyes
at
his
neighbor
fields
where
the
corn
was
as
good
as
his
own
have
you
been
able
to
obtain
what
you
desired
asked
the
devil
alas
answered
the
man
all
the
barns
will
break
down
under
the
weight
of
the
sheaves
the
grain
will
be
sold
at
a
low
price
this
fine
harvest
will
make
me
sit
on
ashes
while
he
was
speaking
the
devil
had
taken
an
ear
of
corn
from
the
ground
and
was
crushing
it
in
his
hand
and
as
soon
as
he
blew
on
the
grains
they
all
turned
into
pure
gold
the
peasant
took
up
one
and
examined
it
attentively
on
all
sides
and
then
in
a
despairing
tone
cried
out
oh
my
god
i
must
spend
money
to
melt
all
these
and
send
them
to
the
mint
the
devil
wrung
his
hands
in
despair
he
had
lost
his
wager
he
could
do
everything
but
he
could
not
make
a
contented
man
the
effects
of
raki
bekri
mustafe
who
lived
during
the
reign
of
sultan
selim
was
a
celebrated
toper
and
perhaps
at
that
time
the
only
moslem
drunkard
in
turkey
consequently
he
was
often
the
subject
of
conversation
in
circles
both
high
and
low
it
happened
that
his
majesty
the
sultan
had
occasion
to
speak
to
bekri
one
day
and
he
asked
him
what
pleasure
he
found
in
drinking
so
much
raki
and
why
he
disobeyed
the
laws
of
the
prophet
bekri
replied
that
raki
was
a
boon
to
man
that
it
made
the
deaf
to
hear
the
blind
to
see
the
lame
to
walk
and
the
poor
rich
and
that
he
bekri
when
drunk
could
hear
see

the
sultan
to
verify
the
truth
of
this
statement
sent
his
servants
into
the
highways
to
bring
four
men

one
blind
the
other
deaf
the
third
lame
and
the
fourth

be
served
to
them
in

with
bekri
they

drinking
long
when
to
the
glory
of
bekri
the
deaf
man
said
i

the
sound
of
great
rumbling
and
the
blind
man
replied
i
can
see
him

is
an
enemy
who
seeks
our
destruction
the
lame
man
asked
where
he
was
saying

him
to
me
and
i
will
quickly
despatch
him
and
the
poor
man
called
out
do
be
afraid
to
kill
him
i
got
his

money
in

pocket
just
then
a
funeral
happened
to
pass
by
the
palace
buildings
and
bekri
got
up
and
ordered
the
solemn
procession
to
stop
removing
the
lid
of
the
coffin
he
whispered
a
few
words
into
the
ear
of
the
dead
man
and
then
putting
his
ear
to
the
dead
man
mouth
vented
an
exclamation
of
surprise
he
then
ordered
the
funeral
to
proceed
and
returned
to
the
palace
the
sultan
asked
him
what
he
had
said
to
the
dead
man
and
what
the
dead
man
replied
i
simply
asked
him
where
he
was
going
and
from
what
he
had
died
and
he
replied
he
was
going
to
paradise
and
that
he
had
died
from
drinking
raki
without
a
mÃ©zÃ©
whereupon
the
sultan
understanding
what
he
wanted
ordered
that
the
