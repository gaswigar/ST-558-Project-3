preface
those
who
have
the
pleasure
of
attending
the
opening
meetings
of
schools
and
colleges
and
of
giving
away
prizes
and
certificates
are
generally
expected
at
the
same
time
to
offer
such
words
of
counsel
and
encouragement
as
the
experience
of
the
world
might
enable
them
to
give
to
those
who
are
entering
life
having
been
myself
when
young
rather
prone
to
suffer
from
low
spirits
i
have
at
several
of
these
gatherings
taken
the
opportunity
of
dwelling
on
the
privileges
and
blessings
we
enjoy
and
i
reprint
here
the
substance
of
some
of
these
addresses
omitting
what
was
special
to
the
circumstances
of
each
case
and
freely
making
any
alterations
and
additions
which
have
since
occurred
to
me
hoping
that
the
thoughts
and
quotations
in
which
i
have
myself
found
most
comfort
may
perhaps
be
of
use
to
others
also
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
i
have
not
by
any
means
referred
to
all
the
sources
of
happiness
open
to
us
some
indeed
of
the
greatest
pleasures
and
blessings
being
altogether
omitted
in
reading
over
the
proofs
i
feel
that
some
sentences
may
appear
too
dogmatic
but
i
hope
that
allowance
will
be
made
for
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
delivered
high
elms
down
kent
preface
to
the
twentieth
edition
a
lecture
which
i
delivered
three
years
ago
at
the
working
men
college
and
which
forms
the
fourth
chapter
of
this
book
has
given
rise
to
a
good
deal
of
discussion
the
mall
took
up
the
subject
and
issued
a
circular
to
many
of
those
best
qualified
to
express
an
opinion
this
elicited
many
interesting
replies
and
some
other
lists
of
books
were
drawn
up
when
my
book
was
translated
a
similar
discussion
took
place
in
germany
the
result
has
been
very
gratifying
and
after
carefully
considering
the
suggestions
which
have
been
made
i
see
no
reason
for
any
material
change
in
the
first
list
i
had
not
presumed
to
form
a
list
of
my
own
nor
did
i
profess
to
give
my
own
favorites
my
attempt
was
to
give
those
most
generally
recommended
by
previous
writers
on
the
subject
in
the
various
criticisms
on
my
list
while
large
additions
amounting
to
several
hundred
works
in
all
have
been
proposed
very
few
omissions
have
been
suggested
as
regards
those
works
with
reference
to
which
some
doubts
have
been
expressed
namely
the
few
oriental
books
wake
apostolic
fathers
i
may
observe
that
i
drew
up
the
list
not
as
that
of
the
hundred
best
books
but
which
is
very
different
of
those
which
have
been
most
frequently
recommended
as
best
worth
reading
for
instance
as
regards
the
and
the
of
confucius
i
must
humbly
confess
that
i
do
not
greatly
admire
either
but
i
recommended
them
because
they
are
held
in
the
most
profound
veneration
by
the
chinese
race
containing
of
our
i
may
add
that
both
works
are
quite
short
the
and
as
epitomized
by
wheeler
and
hilaire
are
not
only
very
interesting
in
themselves
but
very
important
in
reference
to
our
great
oriental
empire
the
authentic
writings
of
the
apostolic
fathers
are
very
short
being
indeed
comprised
in
one
small
volume
and
as
the
only
works
which
have
come
down
to
us
of
those
who
lived
with
and
knew
the
apostles
they
are
certainly
well
worth
reading
i
have
been
surprised
at
the
great
divergence
of
opinion
which
has
been
expressed
nine
lists
of
some
length
have
been
published
these
lists
contain
some
three
hundred
works
not
mentioned
by
me
without
however
any
corresponding
omissions
and
yet
there
is
not
one
single
book
which
occurs
in
every
list
or
even
in
half
of
them
and
only
about
half
a
dozen
which
appear
in
more
than
one
of
the
nine
if
these
authorities
or
even
a
majority
of
them
had
concurred
in
their
recommendations
i
would
have
availed
myself
of
them
but
as
they
differ
so
greatly
i
will
allow
my
list
to
remain
almost
as
i
first
proposed
it
i
have
however
added
kalidasa
or
lost
and
schiller
omitting
in
consequence
lucretius
and
miss
austen
lucretius
because
though
his
work
is
most
remarkable
it
is
perhaps
less
generally
suitable
than
most
of
the
others
in
the
list
and
miss
austen
because
english
novelists
were
somewhat
high
elms
down

the
pleasures
of

all

with

in

and

is

a
dreary
task
and

things
denied

huts

how

the
duty
of
happiness
if
a
man
is
unhappy
this
must
be
his
own
fault
for
god
made
all
men
to
be
epictetus
life
is
a
great
gift
and
as
we
reach
years
of
discretion
we
most
of
us
naturally
ask
ourselves
what
should
be
the
main
object
of
our
existence
even
those
who
do
not
accept
the
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
number
as
an
absolute
rule
will
yet
admit
that
we
should
all
endeavor
to
contribute
as
far
as
we
may
to
the
happiness
of
our
there
are
many
however
who
seem
to
doubt
whether
it
is
right
that
we
should
try
to
be
happy
ourselves
our
own
happiness
ought
not
of
course
to
be
our
main
object
nor
indeed
will
it
ever
be
secured
if
selfishly
sought
we
may
have
many
pleasures
in
life
but
must
not
let
them
have
rule
over
us
or
they
will
soon
hand
us
over
to
sorrow
and
into
what
dangerous
and
miserable
servitude
doth
he
fall
who
suffereth
pleasures
and
sorrows
two
unfaithful
and
cruel
commanders
to
possess
him
successively
i
can
not
however
but
think
that
the
world
would
be
better
and
brighter
if
our
teachers
would
dwell
on
the
duty
of
happiness
as
well
as
on
the
happiness
of
duty
for
we
ought
to
be
as
cheerful
as
we
can
if
only
because
to
be
happy
ourselves
is
a
most
effectual
contribution
to
the
happiness
of
others
every
one
must
have
felt
that
a
cheerful
friend
is
like
a
sunny
day
which
sheds
its
brightness
on
all
around
and
most
of
us
can
as
we
choose
make
of
this
world
either
a
palace
or
a
prison
there
is
no
doubt
some
selfish
satisfaction
in
yielding
to
melancholy
and
fancying
that
we
are
victims
of
fate
in
brooding
over
grievances
especially
if
more
or
less
imaginary
to
be
bright
and
cheerful
often
requires
an
effort
there
is
a
certain
art
in
keeping
ourselves
happy
and
in
this
respect
as
in
others
we
require
to
watch
over
and
manage
ourselves
almost
as
if
we
were
somebody
else
sorrow
and
joy
indeed
are
strangely
interwoven
too
often
we
look
before
and
after
and
pine
for
what
is
not
our
sincerest
laughter
with
some
pain
is
fraught
our
sweetest
songs
are
those
that
tell
of
saddest
thought
as
a
nation
we
are
prone
to
melancholy
it
has
been
said
of
our
countrymen
that
they
take
even
their
pleasures
sadly
but
this
if
it
be
true
at
all
will
i
hope
prove
a
transitory
characteristic
merry
england
was
the
old
saying
let
us
hope
it
may
become
true
again
we
must
look
to
the
east
for
real
melancholy
what
can
be
sadder
than
the
lines
with
which
omar
khayyam
opens
his
quatrains
we
sojourn
here
for
one
short
day
or
two
and
all
the
gain
we
get
is
grief
and
woe
and
then
leaving
life
problems
all
unsolved
and
harassed
by
regrets
we
have
to
go
or
the
devas
song
to
prince
siddârtha
in
edwin
arnold
beautiful
version
we
are
the
voices
of
the
wandering
wind
which
moan
for
rest
and
rest
can
never
find
lo
as
the
wind
is
so
is
mortal
life
a
moan
a
sigh
a
sob
a
storm
a
strife
if
indeed
this
be
true
if
mortal
life
be
so
sad
and
full
of
suffering
no
wonder
that
nirvâna
the
cessation
of
sorrow
should
be
welcomed
even
at
the
sacrifice
of
consciousness
but
ought
we
not
to
place
before
ourselves
a
very
different
ideal
a
healthier
manlier
and
nobler
hope
life
is
not
to
live
merely
but
to
live
well
there
are
some
who
live
without
any
design
at
all
and
only
pass
in
the
world
like
straws
on
a
river
they
do
not
go
they
are
carried
but
as
homer
makes
ulysses
say
how
dull
it
is
to
pause
to
make
an
end
to
rest
unburnished
not
to
shine
in
use
as
though
to
breathe
were
life
goethe
tells
us
that
at
thirty
he
resolved
to
work
out
life
no
longer
by
halves
but
in
all
its
beauty
and
totality
im
ganzen
guten
schönen
resolut
zu
leben
life
indeed
must
be
measured
by
thought
and
action
not
by
time
it
certainly
may
be
and
ought
to
be
bright
interesting
and
happy
and
according
to
the
italian
proverb
if
all
can
not
live
on
the
piazza
every
one
may
feel
the
sun
if
we
do
our
best
if
we
do
not
magnify
trifling
troubles
if
we
look
resolutely
i
do
not
say
at
the
bright
side
of
things
but
at
things
as
they
really
are
if
we
avail
ourselves
of
the
manifold
blessings
which
surround
us
we
can
not
but
feel
that
life
is
indeed
a
glorious
inheritance
more
servants
wait
on
man
than
he
take
notice
of
in
every
path
he
treads
down
that
which
doth
befriend
him
when
sickness
makes
him
pale
and
wan
oh
mighty
love
man
is
one
world
and
hath
another
to
attend
him
few
of
us
however
realize
the
wonderful
privilege
of
living
or
the
blessings
we
inherit
the
glories
and
beauties
of
the
universe
which
is
our
own
if
we
choose
to
have
it
so
the
extent
to
which
we
can
make
ourselves
what
we
wish
to
be
or
the
power
we
possess
of
securing
peace
of
triumphing
over
pain
and
sorrow
dante
pointed
to
the
neglect
of
opportunities
as
a
serious
fault
man
can
do
violence
to
himself
and
his
own
blessings
and
for
this
he
in
the
second
round
must
aye
deplore
with
unavailing
penitence
his
crime
deprives
himself
of
life
and
light
in
reckless
lavishment
his
talent
wastes
and
sorrows
then
when
he
should
dwell
in
joy
ruskin
has
expressed
this
with
special
allusion
to
the
marvellous
beauty
of
this
glorious
world
too
often
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
remembered
if
at
all
almost
without
gratitude
holy
men
he
complains
in
the
recommending
of
the
love
of
god
to
us
refer
but
seldom
to
those
things
in
which
it
is
most
abundantly
and
immediately
shown
though
they
insist
much
on
his
giving
of
bread
and
raiment
and
health
which
he
gives
to
all
inferior
creatures
they
require
us
not
to
thank
him
for
that
glory
of
his
works
which
he
has
permitted
us
alone
to
perceive
they
tell
us
often
to
meditate
in
the
closet
but
they
send
us
not
like
isaac
into
the
fields
at
even
they
dwell
on
the
duty
of
self
denial
but
they
exhibit
not
the
duty
of
delight
and
yet
as
he
justly
says
elsewhere
each
of
us
as
we
travel
the
way
of
life
has
the
choice
according
to
our
working
of
turning
all
the
voices
of
nature
into
one
song
of
rejoicing
or
of
withering
and
quenching
her
sympathy
into
a
fearful
withdrawn
silence
of
condemnation
into
a
crying
out
of
her
stones
and
a
shaking
of
her
dust
against
us
must
we
not
all
admit
with
sir
henry
taylor
that
the
retrospect
of
life
swarms
with
lost
opportunities
whoever
enjoys
not
life
says
sir
browne
i
count
him
but
an
apparition
though
he
wears
about
him
the
visible
affections
of
flesh
bernard
indeed
goes
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
nothing
can
work
me
damage
except
myself
the
harm
that
i
sustain
i
carry
about
with
me
and
never
am
a
real
sufferer
but
by
my
own
fault
some
heathen
moralists
also
have
taught
very
much
the
same
lesson
the
gods
says
marcus
aurelius
have
put
all
the
means
in
man
power
to
enable
him
not
to
fall
into
real
evils
now
that
which
does
not
make
a
man
worse
how
can
it
make
his
life
worse
epictetus
takes
the
same
line
if
a
man
is
unhappy
remember
that
his
unhappiness
is
his
own
fault
for
god
has
made
all
men
to
be
happy
i
am
he
elsewhere
says
always
content
with
that
which
happens
for
i
think
that
what
god
chooses
is
better
than
what
i
choose
and
again
seek
not
that
things
should
happen
as
you
wish
but
wish
the
things
which
happen
to
be
as
they
are
and
you
will
have
a
tranquil
flow
of
life
if
you
wish
for
anything
which
belongs
to
another
you
lose
that
which
is
your
own
few
however
if
any
can
i
think
go
as
far
as
bernard
we
can
not
but
suffer
from
pain
sickness
and
anxiety
from
the
loss
the
unkindness
the
faults
even
the
coldness
of
those
we
love
how
many
a
day
has
been
damped
and
darkened
by
an
angry
word
hegel
is
said
to
have
calmly
finished
his
des
at
jena
on
the
october
not
knowing
anything
whatever
of
the
battle
that
was
raging
round
him
matthew
arnold
has
suggested
that
we
might
take
a
lesson
from
the
heavenly
bodies
unaffrighted
by
the
silence
round
them
undistracted
by
the
sights
they
see
these
demand
not
the
things
without
them
yield
them
love
amusement
sympathy
bounded
by
themselves
and
unobservant
in
what
state
god
other
works
may
be
in
their
own
tasks
all
their
powers
pouring
these
attain
the
mighty
life
you
see
it
is
true
that
a
man
is
his
own
star
our
acts
our
angels
are
for
good
or
ill
and
that
rather
than
follow
a
multitude
to
do
evil
one
should
stand
like
pompey
pillar
conspicuous
by
oneself
and
single
in
integrity
but
to
many
this
isolation
would
be
itself
most
painful
for
the
heart
is
no
island
cut
off
from
other
lands
but
a
continent
that
joins
to
them
if
we
separate
ourselves
so
much
from
the
interests
of
those
around
us
that
we
do
not
sympathize
with
them
in
their
sufferings
we
shut
ourselves
out
from
sharing
their
happiness
and
lose
far
more
than
we
gain
if
we
avoid
sympathy
and
wrap
ourselves
round
in
a
cold
chain
armor
of
selfishness
we
exclude
ourselves
from
many
of
the
greatest
and
purest
joys
of
life
to
render
ourselves
insensible
to
pain
we
must
forfeit
also
the
possibility
of
happiness
moreover
much
of
what
we
call
evil
is
really
good
in
disguise
and
we
should
not
quarrel
rashly
with
adversities
not
yet
understood
nor
overlook
the
mercies
often
bound
up
in
them
pleasure
and
pain
are
as
plutarch
says
the
nails
which
fasten
body
and
soul
together
pain
is
a
warning
of
danger
a
very
necessity
of
existence
but
for
it
but
for
the
warnings
which
our
feelings
give
us
the
very
blessings
by
which
we
are
surrounded
would
soon
and

helmholtz
dates
his
start
in
science
to
an
attack
of
illness
this
led
to
his
acquisition
of
a
microscope
which
he
was
enabled
to
purchase
owing
to
his
having
spent
his
autumn
vacation
of
in
the
hospital
prostrated
by
typhoid
fever
being
a
pupil
he
was
nursed
without
expense
and
on
his
recovery
he
found
himself
in
possession
of
the
savings
of
his
small
resources
savonarola
says
castelar
would
under
different
circumstances
undoubtedly
have
been
a
good
husband
a
tender
father
a
man
unknown
to
history
utterly
powerless
to
print
upon
the
sands
of
time
and
upon
the
human
soul
the
deep
trace
which
he
has
left
but
misfortune
came
to
visit
him
to
crush
his
heart
and
to
impart
that
marked
melancholy
which
characterizes
a
soul
in
grief
and
the
grief
that
circled
his
brows
with
a
crown
of
thorns
was
also
that
which
wreathed
them
with
the
splendor
of
immortality
his
hopes
were
centered
in
the
woman
he
loved
his
life
was
set
upon
the
possession
of
her
and
when
her
family
finally
rejected
him
partly
on
account
of
his
profession
and
partly
on
account
of
his
person
believed
that
it
was
death
that
had
come
upon
him
when
in
truth
it
was
immortality
it
is
however
impossible
to
deny
the
existence
of
evil
and
the
reason
for
it
has
long
exercised
the
human
intellect
the
savage
solves
it
by
the
supposition
of
evil
spirits
the
greeks
attributed
the
misfortunes
of
men
in
great
measure
to
the
antipathies
and
jealousies
of
gods
and
goddesses
others
have
imagined
two
divine
principles
opposite
and
antagonistic
the
one
friendly
the
other
hostile
to
men
freedom
of
action
however
seems
to
involve
the
existence
of
evil
if
any
power
of
selection
be
left
us
much
must
depend
on
the
choice
we
make
in
the
very
nature
of
things
two
and
two
can
not
make

epictetus

addressing
man
as
follows
if
it
had
been
possible
to
make
your
body
and
your
property
free
from
liability
to
injury
i
would
have
done
so
as
this
could
not
be
i
have
given
you
a
small
portion
of
myself
this
divine
gift
it
is
for
us
to
use
wisely
it
is
in
fact
our
most
valuable
treasure
the
soul
is
a
much
better
thing
than
all
the
others
which
you
possess
can
you
then
show
me
in
what
way
you
have
taken
care
of
it
for
it
is
not
likely
that
you
who
are
so
wise
a
man
inconsiderately
and
carelessly
allow
the
most
valuable
thing
that
you
possess
to
be
neglected
and
to
perish
moreover
even
if
evil
can
not
be
altogether
avoided
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
not
only
whether
the
life
we
lead
be
good
and
useful
or
evil
and
useless
but
also
whether
it
be
happy
or
unhappy
is
very
much
in
our
own
power
and
depends
greatly
on
ourselves
time
alone
relieves
the
foolish
from
sorrow
but
reason
the
wise
and
no
one
was
ever
yet
made
utterly
miserable
excepting
by
himself
we
are
if
not
the
masters
at
any
rate
almost
the
creators
of
ourselves
with
most
of
us
it
is
not
so
much
great
sorrows
disease
or
death
but
rather
the
little
daily
dyings
which
cloud
over
the
sunshine
of
life
many
of
our
troubles
are
insignificant
in
themselves
and
might
easily
be
avoided
how
happy
home
might
generally
be
made
but
for
foolish
quarrels
or
misunderstandings
as
they
are
well
named
it
is
our
own
fault
if
we
are
querulous
or
nor
need
we
though
this
is
less
easy
allow
ourselves
to
be
made
unhappy
by
the
querulousness
or
of
others
much
of
what
we
suffer
we
have
brought
on
ourselves
if
not
by
actual
fault
at
least
by
ignorance
or
thoughtlessness
too
often
we
think
only
of
the
happiness
of
the
moment
and
sacrifice
that
of
the
life
troubles
comparatively
seldom
come
to
us
it
is
we
who
go
to
them
many
of
us
fritter
our
life
away
la
bruyčre
says
that
most
men
spend
much
of
their
lives
in
making
the
rest
miserable
or
as
goethe
puts
it
careworn
man
has
in
all
ages
sown
vanity
to
reap
despair
not
only
do
we
suffer
much
in
the
anticipation
of
evil
as
noah
lived
many
years
under
the
affliction
of
a
flood
and
jerusalem
was
taken
unto
jeremy
before
it
was
besieged
but
we
often
distress
ourselves
greatly
in
the
apprehension
of
misfortunes
which
after
all
never
happen
at
all
we
should
do
our
best
and
wait
calmly
the
result
we
often
hear
of
people
breaking
down
from
overwork
but
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
are
really
suffering
from
worry
or
anxiety

our

this
however
applies
to
the
grown
up
with
children
of
course
it
is
different
it
is
customary
but
i
think
it
is
a
mistake
to
speak
of
happy
childhood
children
however
are
often
and
acutely
sensitive
man
ought
to
be

and

of

are
at
the

around

rarey

has
told
us
that
he
has
known
an
angry
word

the
pulse
of
a
horse
ten
beats
in
a
minute
think
then
how
it
must
affect
a
child
it
is
small
blame
to
the
young
if
they
are
but
it
is
a
danger
to
be
striven
against
the
terrors
of
the
storm
are
chiefly
felt
in
the
parlor
or
the
cabin
to
save
ourselves
from
imaginary
or
at
any
rate
problematical
evils
we
often
incur
real
suffering
the
man
said
epicurus
who
is
not
content
with
little
is
content
with
nothing
how
often
do
we
labor
for
that
which
satisfieth
not
more
than
we
use
is
more
than
we
need
and
only
a
burden
to
the
bearer
we
most
of
us
give
ourselves
an
immense
amount
of
useless
trouble
encumber
ourselves
as
it
were
on
the
journey
of
life
with
a
dead
weight
of
unnecessary
baggage
and
as
a
man
maketh
his
train
longer
he
makes
his
wings
shorter
in
that
delightful
fairy
tale
through
the
the
white
knight
is
described
as
having
loaded
himself
on
starting
for
a
journey
with
a
variety
of
odds
and
ends
including
a
mousetrap
in
case
he
was
troubled
by
mice
at
night
and
a
beehive
in
case
he
came
across
a
swarm
of
bees
hearne
in
his
to
the
mouth
of
the
coppermine
tells
us
that
a
few
days
after
starting
on
his
expedition
he
met
a
party
of
indians
who
annexed
a
great
deal
of
his
property
and
all
hearne
says
is
the
weight
of
our
baggage
being
so
much
lightened
our
next
day
journey
was
much
pleasanter
i
ought
however
to
add
that
the
indians
broke
up
the
philosophical
instruments
which
no
doubt
were
rather
an
encumbrance
when
troubles
do
come
marcus
aurelius
wisely
tells
us
to
remember
on
every
occasion
which
leads
thee
to
vexation
to
apply
this
principle
that
this
is
not
a
misfortune
but
that
to
bear
it
nobly
is
good
fortune
our
own
anger
indeed
does
us
more
harm
than
the
thing
which
makes
us
angry
and
we
suffer
much
more
from
the
anger
and
vexation
which
we
allow
acts
to
rouse
in
us
than
we
do
from
the
acts
themselves
at
which
we
are
angry
and
vexed
how
much
most
people
for
instance
allow
themselves
to
be
distracted
and
disturbed
by
quarrels
and
family
disputes
yet
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
one
ought
not
to
suffer
from
being
found
fault
with
if
the
condemnation
is
just
it
should
be
welcome
as
a
warning
if
it
is
undeserved
why
should
we
allow
it
to
distress
us
moreover
if
misfortunes
happen
we
do
but
make
them
worse
by
grieving
over
them
i
must
die
again
says
epictetus
but
must
i
then
die
sorrowing
i
must
be
put
in
chains
must
i
then
also
lament
i
must
go
into
exile
can
i
be
prevented
from
going
with
cheerfulness
and
contentment
but
i
will
put
you
in
prison
man
what
are
you
saying
you
may
put
my
body
in
prison
but
my
mind
not
even
zeus
himself
can
overpower
if
indeed
we
can
not
be
happy
the
fault
is
generally
in
ourselves
socrates
lived
under
the
thirty
tyrants
epictetus
was
a
poor
slave
and
yet
how
much
we
owe
him
how
is
it
possible
he
says
that
a
man
who
has
nothing
who
is
naked
houseless
without
a
hearth
squalid
without
a
slave
without
a
city
can
pass
a
life
that
flows
easily
see
god
has
sent
a
man
to
show
you
that
it
is
possible
look
at
me
who
am
without
a
city
without
a
house
without
possessions
without
a
slave
i
sleep
on
the
ground
i
have
no
wife
no
children
no
praetorium
but
only
the
earth
and
heavens
and
one
poor
clock
and
what
do
i
want
am
i
not
without
sorrow
am
i
not
without
fear
am
i
not
free
when
did
any
of
you
see
me
failing
in
the
object
of
my
desire
or
ever
falling
into
that
which
i
would
avoid
did
i
ever
blame
god
or
man
did
i
ever
accuse
any
man
did
any
of
you
ever
see
me
with
a
sorrowful
countenance
and
how
do
i
meet
with
those
whom
you
are
afraid
of
and
admire
do
not
i
treat
them
like
slaves
who
when
he
sees
me
does
not
think
that
he
sees
his
king
and
master
think
how
much
we
have
to
be
thankful
for
few
of
us
appreciate
the
number
of
our
everyday
blessings
we
look
on
them
as
trifles
and
yet
trifles
make
perfection
and
perfection
is
no
trifle
as
michael
angelo
said
we
forget
them
because
they
are
always
with
us
and
yet
for
each
of
us
as
pater
well
observes
these
simple
gifts
and
others
equally
trivial
bread
and
wine
fruit
and
milk
might
regain
that
poetic
and
as
it
were
moral
significance
which
surely
belongs
to
all
the
means
of
our
daily
life
could
we
but
break
through
the
veil
of
our
familiarity
with
things
by
no
means
vulgar
in
themselves
let
not
says
isaak
walton
the
blessings
we
receive
daily
from
god
make
us
not
to
value
or
not
praise
him
because
they
be
common
let
us
not
forget
to
praise
him
for
the
innocent
mirth
and
pleasure
we
have
met
with
since
we
met
together
what
would
a
blind
man
give
to
see
the
pleasant
rivers
and
meadows
and
flowers
and
fountains
and
this
and
many
other
like
blessings
we
enjoy
daily
contentment
we
have
been
told
by
epicurus
consists
not
in
great
wealth
but
in
few
wants
in
this
fortunate
country
however
we
may
have
many
wants
and
yet
if
they
are
only
reasonable
we
may
gratify
them
all
nature
indeed
provides
without
stint
the
main
requisites
of
human
happiness
to
watch
the
corn
grow
or
the
blossoms
set
to
draw
hard
breath
over
or
spade
to
read
to
think
to
love
to
pray
these
says
ruskin
are
the
things
that
make
men
happy
i
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
thieves
says
jeremy
taylor
what
then
they
have
left
me
the
sun
and
moon
fire
and
water
a
loving
wife
and
many
friends
to
pity
me
and
some
to
relieve
me
and
i
can
still
discourse
and
unless
i
list
they
have
not
taken
away
my
merry
countenance
and
my
cheerful
spirit
and
a
good
conscience
and
he
that
hath
so
many
causes
of
joy
and
so
great
is
very
much
in
love
with
sorrow
and
peevishness
who
loses
all
these
pleasures
and
chooses
to
sit
down
on
his
little
handful
of
thorns
when
a
man
has
such
things
to
think
on
and
sees
the
sun
the
moon
and
stars
and
enjoys
earth
and
sea
he
is
not
solitary
or
even
helpless
paradise
indeed

to
the
whole

what
more
is

ask
for

the

everything

bestowed
in
boundless
profusion
on

our
existence
we
can
conceive

nothing
more
exquisite
or
perfect
than
what
is
round
us
every
hour
and
our
perceptions
are
so
framed
as
to
be
consciously
alive
to
all
the
provision
made
for
our
sensuous
enjoyment

in
overflowing
abundance
so
is
that
for
the
other
elements
of
our
complex
nature
who
that
has
revelled
in
the
opening
ecstasies
of
a
young
imagination
or
the
rich
marvels
of
the
world
of
thought
does
not
confess
that
the
intelligence
has
been
dowered
at
least
with
as
profuse
a
beneficence
as
the
senses
who
that
has
truly
tasted
and
fathomed
human
love
in
its
dawning
and
crowning
joys
has
not
thanked
god
for
a
felicity

indeed
understanding
if
we
had
set
our
fancy
to

creator
occupied
solely
in
devising
delight
for

the
happiness
of
duty
i
am
always
content
with
that
which
happens
for
i
think
that
what
god
chooses
is
better
than
what
i
choose
epictetus
o
god
all
conquering
this
lower
earth
would
be
for
men
the
blest
abode
of
mirth
if
they
were
strong
in
thee
as
other
things
of
this
world
well
are
seen
oh
then
far
other
than
they
yet
have
been
how
happy
would
men
be
king
alfred
ed
of
of
we
ought
not
to
picture
duty
to
ourselves
or
to
others
as
a
stern
taskmistress
she
is
rather
a
kind
and
sympathetic
mother
ever
ready
to
shelter
us
from
the
cares
and
anxieties
of
this
world
and
to
guide
us
in
the
paths
of
peace
to
shut
oneself
up
from
mankind
is
in
most
cases
to
lead
a
dull
as
well
as
a
selfish
life
our
duty
is
to
make
ourselves
useful
and
thus
life
may
be
most
interesting
and
yet
comparatively
free
from
anxiety
but
how
can
we
fill
our
lives
with
energy
and
interest
and
yet
keep
care
outside
many
great
men
have
made
shipwreck
in
the
attempt
anthony
sought
for
happiness
in
love
brutus
in
glory
caesar
in
dominion
the
first
found
disgrace
the
second
disgust
the
last
ingratitude
and
each
destruction
riches
again
often
bring
danger
trouble
and
temptation
they
require
care
to
keep
though
they
may
give
much
happiness
if
wisely
spent
how
then
is
this
great
object
to
be
secured
what
says
marcus
aurelius
what
is
that
which
is
able
to
conduct
a
man
one
thing
and
only
one
philosophy
but
this
consists
in
keeping
the
daemon
within
a
man
free
from
violence
and
unharmed
superior
to
pains
and
pleasures
doing
nothing
without
a
purpose
yet
not
falsely
and
with
hypocrisy
not
feeling
the
need
of
another
man
doing
or
not
doing
anything
and
besides
accepting
all
that
happens
and
all
that
is
allotted
as
coming
from
thence
wherever
it
is
from
whence
he
himself
came
and
finally
waiting
for
death
with
a
cheerful
mind
as
being
nothing
else
than
a
dissolution
of
the
elements
of
which
every
living
being
is
compounded
i
confess
i
do
not
feel
the
force
of
these
last
few
words
which
indeed
scarcely
seem
requisite
for
his
argument
the
thought
of
death
however
certainly
influences
the
conduct
of
life
less
than
might
have
been
expected
bacon
truly
points
out
that
there
is
no
passion
in
the
mind
of
man
so
weak
but
it
mates
and
masters
the
fear
of
death
revenge
triumphs
over
death
love
slights
it
honor
aspireth
to
it
grief
flieth
to
it
think
not
i
dread
to
see
my
spirit
fly
through
the
dark
gates
of
fell
mortality
death
has
no
terrors
when
the
life
is
true
is
living
ill
that
makes
us
fear
to
die
we
need
certainly
have
no
such
fear
if
we
have
done
our
best
to
make
others
happy
to
promote
peace
on
earth
and
goodwill
amongst
men
nothing
again
can
do
more
to
release
us
from
the
cares
of
this
world
which
consume
so
much
of
our
time
and
embitter
so
much
of
our
life
when
we
have
done
our
best
we
should
wait
the
result
in
peace
content
as
epictetus
says
with
that
which
happens
for
what
god
chooses
is
better
than
what
i
choose
at
any
rate
if
we
have
not
effected
all
we
wished
we
shall
have
influenced
ourselves
it
may
be
true
that
one
can
not
do
much
you
are
not
hercules
and
you
are
not
able
to
purge
away
the
wickedness
of
others
nor
yet
are
you
theseus
able
to
drive
away
the
evil
things
of
attica
but
you
may
clear
away
your
own
from
yourself
from
your
own
thoughts
cast
away
instead
of
procrustes
and
sciron
sadness
fear
desire
envy
malevolence
avarice
effeminacy
intemperance
but
it
is
not
possible
to
eject
these
things
otherwise
than
by
looking
to
god
only
by
fixing
your
affections
on
him
only
by
being
consecrated
by
his
commands
people
sometimes
think
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
be
quite
free
but
a
fish
as
ruskin
says
is
freer
than
a
man
and
as
for
a
fly
it
is
a
black
incarnation
of
freedom
a
life
of
pleasure
and
is
not
a
life
of
real
happiness
or
true
freedom
far
from
it
if
we
once
begin
to
give
way
to
ourselves
we
fall
under
a
most
intolerable
tyranny
other
temptations
are
in
some
respects
like
that
of
drink
at
first
perhaps
it
seems
delightful
but
there
is
bitterness
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
men
drink
to
satisfy
the
desire
created
by
previous
indulgence
so
it
is
in
other
things
repetition
soon
becomes
a
craving
not
a
pleasure
resistance
grows
more
and
more
painful
yielding
which
at
first
perhaps
afforded
some
slight
and
temporary
gratification
soon
ceases
to
give
pleasure
and
even
if
for
a
time
it
procures
relief
ere
long
becomes
odious
itself
to
resist
is
difficult
to
give
way
is
painful
until
at
length
the
wretched
victim
to
himself
can
only
purchase
or
thinks
he
can
only
purchase
temporary
relief
from
intolerable
craving
and
depression
at
the
expense
of
far
greater
suffering
in
the
future
on
the
other
hand
however
difficult
at
first
becomes
step
by
step
easier
and
more
delightful
we
possess
mysteriously
a
sort
of
dual
nature
and
there
are
few
truer
triumphs
or
more
delightful
sensations
than
to
obtain
thorough
command
of
oneself
how
much
pleasanter
it
is
to
ride
a
spirited
horse
even
perhaps
though
requiring
some
strength
and
skill
than
to
creep
along
upon
a
jaded
hack
in
the
one
case
you
feel
under
you
the
free
responsive
spring
of
a
living
and
willing
force
in
the
other
you
have
to
spur
a
dull
and
lifeless
slave
to
rule
oneself
is
in
reality
the
greatest
triumph
he
who
is
his
own
monarch
says
sir
browne
contentedly
sways
the
sceptre
of
himself
not
envying
the
glory
to
crowned
heads
and
elohim
of
the
earth
for
those
are
really
highest
who
are
nearest
to
heaven
and
those
are
lowest
who
are
farthest
from
it
true
greatness
has
little
if
anything
to
do
with
rank
or
power
eurystheus
being
what
he
was
says
epictetus
was
not
really
king
of
argos
nor
of
mycenae
for
he
could
not
even
rule
himself
while
hercules
purged
lawlessness
and
introduced
justice
though
he
was
both
naked
and
alone
we
are
told
that
cineas
the
philosopher
once
asked
pyrrhus
what
he
would
do
when
he
had
conquered
italy
i
will
conquer
sicily
and
after
sicily
then
africa
and
after
you
have
conquered
the
world
i
will
take
my
ease
and
be
merry
then
asked
cineas
why
can
you
not
take
your
ease
and
be
merry
now
moreover
as
sir
arthur
helps
has
wisely
pointed
out
the
enlarged
view
we
have
of
the
universe
must
in
some
measure
damp
personal
ambition
what
is
it
to
be
king
sheikh
tetrarch
or
emperor
over
a
of
a
bit
of
this
little
earth
all
rising
to
great
place
says
bacon
is
by
a
winding
stair
and
princes
are
like
heavenly
bodies
which
have
much
veneration
but
no
rest
plato
in
the
mentions
an
old
myth
that
after
death
every
soul
has
to
choose
a
lot
in
life
for
the
existence
in
the
next
world
and
he
tells
us
that
the
wise
ulysses
searched
for
a
considerable
time
for
the
lot
of
a
private
man
he
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
it
as
it
was
lying
neglected
in
a
corner
but
when
he
had
secured
it
he
was
delighted
the
recollection
of
all
he
had
gone
through
on
earth
having
disenchanted
him
of
ambition
moreover
there
is
a
great
deal
of
drudgery
in
the
lives
of
courts
ceremonials
may
be
important
but
they
take
up
much
time
and
are
terribly
tedious
a
man
then
is
his
own
best
kingdom
he
that
ruleth
his
speech
says
solomon
is
better
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
but
this
truest
and
greatest
monarchy
rarely
comes
by
inheritance
every
one
of
us
must
conquer
himself
and
we
may
do
so
if
we
take
conscience
for
our
guide
and
general
no
one
really
fails
who
does
his
best
seneca
observes
that
no
one
saith
the
three
hundred
fabii
were
defeated
but
that
they
were
slain
and
if
you
have
done
your
best
you
will
in
the
words
of
an
old
norse
ballad
have
gained
success
in
thyself
which
is
best
of
all
being
myself
engaged
in
business
i
was
rather
startled
to
find
it
laid
down
by
no
less
an
authority
than
aristotle
almost
as
if
it
were
a
proposition
that
commerce
is
incompatible
with
that
dignified
life
which
it
is
our
wish
that
our
citizens
should
lead
and
totally
adverse
to
that
generous
elevation
of
mind
with
which
it
is
our
ambition
to
inspire
them
i
know
not
how
far
that
may
really
have
been
the
spirit
and
tendency
of
commerce
among
the
ancient
greeks
but
if
so
i
do
not
wonder
that
it
was
not
more
successful
i
may
indeed
quote
aristotle
against
himself
for
he
has
elsewhere
told
us
that
business
should
be
chosen
for
the
sake
of
leisure
and
things
necessary
and
useful
for
the
sake
of
the
beautiful
in
conduct
it
is
not
true
that
the
ordinary
duties
of
life
in
a
country
like
ours
commerce
manufactures
agriculture
the
pursuits
to
which
the
vast
majority
are
and
must
be
devoted
are
incompatible
with
the
dignity
or
nobility
of
life
whether
a
life
is
noble
or
ignoble
depends
not
on
the
calling
which
is
adopted
but
on
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
followed
the
humblest
life
may
be
noble
while
that
of
the
most
powerful
monarch
or
the
greatest
genius
may
be
contemptible
commerce
indeed
is
not
only
compatible
but
i
would
almost
go
further
and
say
that
it
will
be
most
successful
if
carried
on
in
happy
union
with
noble
aims
and
generous
aspirations
what
ruskin
says
of
art
is
with
due
modification
true
of
life
generally
it
does
not
matter
whether
a
man
paint
the
petal
of
a
rose
or
the
chasms
of
a
precipice
so
that
love
and
admiration
attend
on
him
as
he
labors
and
wait
for
ever
on
his
work
it
does
not
matter
whether
he
toil
for
months
on
a
few
inches
of
his
canvas
or
cover
a
palace
front
with
color
in
a
day
so
only
that
it
be
with
a
solemn
purpose
that
he
have
filled
his
heart
with
patience
or
urged
his
hand
to
haste
it
is
true
that
in
a
subsequent
volume
he
refers
to
this
passage
and
adds
but
though
all
is
good
for
study
and
all
is
beautiful
some
is
better
than
the
rest
for
the
help
and
pleasure
of
others
and
this
it
is
our
duty
always
to
choose
if
we
have
opportunity
adding
however
being
quite
happy
with
what
is
within
our
reach
if
we
have
not
we
read
of
and
admire
the
heroes
of
old
but
every
one
of
us
has
to
fight
his
own
marathon
and
thermopylae
every
one
meets
the
sphinx
sitting
by
the
road
he
has
to
pass
to
each
of
us
as
to
hercules
is
offered
the
choice
of
vice
or
virtue
we
may
like
paris
give
the
apple
of
life
to
venus
or
juno
or
minerva
there
are
many
who
seem
to
think
that
we
have
fallen
on
an
age
in
the
world
when
life
is
especially
difficult
and
anxious
when
there
is
less
leisure
than
of
yore
and
the
struggle
for
existence
is
keener
than
ever
on
the
other
hand
we
must
remember
how
much
we
have
gained
in
security
it
may
be
an
age
of
hard
work
but
when
this
is
not
carried
to
an
extreme
it
is
by
no
means
an
evil
if
we
have
less
leisure
one
reason
is
because
life
is
so
full
of
interest
cheerfulness
is
the
daughter
of
employment
and
on
the
whole
i
believe
there
never
was
a
time
when
modest
merit
and
patient
industry
were
more
sure
of
reward
we
must
not
indeed
be
discouraged
if
success
be
slow
in
coming
nor
puffed
up
if
it
comes
quickly
we
often
complain
of
the
nature
of
things
when
the
fault
is
all
in
ourselves
seneca
in
one
of
his
letters
mentions
that
his
wife
maid
harpaste
had
nearly
lost
her
eyesight
but
she
knoweth
not
she
is
blind
she
saith
the
house
is
dark
this
that
seemeth
ridiculous
unto
us
in
her
happeneth
unto
us
all
no
man
understandeth
that
he
is
covetous
or
avaricious
he
saith
i
am
not
ambitious
but
no
man
can
otherwise
live
in
rome
i
am
not
sumptuous
but
the
city
requireth
great
expense
newman
in
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
of
his
hymns
lead
kindly
light
says
keep
thou
my
feet
i
do
not
ask
to
see
the
distant
scene
one
step
enough
for
me
but
we
must
be
sure
that
we
are
really
following
some
trustworthy
guide
and
not
out
of
mere
laziness
allowing
ourselves
to
drift
we
have
a
guide
within
us
which
will
generally
lead
us
straight
enough
religion
no
doubt
is
full
of
difficulties
but
if
we
are
often
puzzled
what
to
think
we
need
seldom
be
in
doubt
what
to
do
to
say
well
is
good
but
to
do
well
is
better
do
well
is
the
spirit
and
say
well
the
letter
if
do
well
and
say
well
were
fitted
in
one
frame
all
were
won
all
were
done
and
got
were
all
the
gain
cleanthes
who
appears
to
have
well
merited
the
statue
erected
to
him
at
assos
says
lead
me
o
zeus
and
thou
o
destiny
the
way
that
i
am
bid
by
you
to
go
to
follow
i
am
ready
if
i
choose
not
i
make
myself
a
wretch
and
still
must
follow
if
we
are
ever
in
doubt
what
to
do
it
is
a
good
rule
to
ask
ourselves
what
we
shall
wish
on
the
morrow
that
we
had
done
moreover
the
result
in
the
long
run
will
depend
not
so
much
on
some
single
resolution
or
on
our
action
in
a
special
case
but
rather
on
the
preparation
of
daily
life
battles
are
often
won
before
they
are
fought
to
control
our
passions
we
must
govern
our
habits
and
keep
watch
over
ourselves
in
the
small
details
of
everyday
life
the
importance
of
small
things
has
been
pointed
out
by
philosophers
over
and
over
again
from
aesop
downward
great
without
small
makes
a
bad
wall
says
a
quaint
greek
proverb
which
seems
to
go
back
to
cyclopean
times
in
an
old
hindoo
story
ammi
says
to
his
son
bring
me
a
fruit
of
that
tree
and
break
it
open
what
is
there
the
son
said
some
small
seeds
break
one
of
them
and
what
do
you
see
nothing
my
lord
my
child
said
ammi
where
you
see
nothing
there
dwells
a
mighty
tree
it
may
almost
be
questioned
whether
anything
can
be
truly
called
small
there
is
no
great
and
no
small
to
the
soul
that
maketh
all
and
where
it
cometh
all
things
are
and
it
cometh
everywhere
we
should
therefore
watch
ourselves
in
small
things
if
you
wish
not
to
be
of
an
angry
temper
do
not
feed
the
habit
throw
nothing
on
it
which
will
increase
it
at
first
keep
quiet
and
count
the
days
on
which
you
have
not
been
angry
i
used
to
be
in
passion
every
day
now
every
second
day
then
every
third
then
every
fourth
but
if
you
have
intermitted
thirty
days
make
a
sacrifice
to
god
for
the
habit
at
first
begins
to
be
weakened
and
then
is
completely
destroyed
when
you
can
say
have
not
been
vexed
nor
the
day
before
nor
yet
on
any
succeeding
day
during
two
or
three
months
but
i
took
care
when
some
exciting
things
happened
be
assured
that
you
are
in
a
good
way
emerson
closes
his
of
with
a
striking
allegory
the
young
mortal
enters
the
hall
of
the
firmament
the
gods
are
sitting
there
and
he
is
alone
with
them
they
pour
on
him
gifts
and
blessings
and
beckon
him
to
their
thrones
but
between
him
and
them
suddenly
appear
of
illusions
he
imagines
himself
in
a
vast
crowd
whose
behests
he
fancies
he
must
obey
the
mad
crowd
drives
hither
and
thither
and
sways
this
way
and
that
what
is
he
that
he
should
resist
he
lets
himself
be
carried
about
how
can
he
think
or
act
for
himself
but
the
clouds
lift
and
there
are
the
gods
still
sitting
on
their
thrones
they
alone
with
him
alone
the
great
man
he
elsewhere
says
is
he
who
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
keeps
with
perfect
sweetness
the
serenity
of
solitude
we
may
all
if
we
will
secure
peace
of
mind
for
ourselves
men
seek
retreats
says
marcus
aurelius
houses
in
the
country
seashores
and
mountains
and
thou
too
art
wont
to
desire
such
things
very
much
but
this
is
altogether
a
mark
of
the
most
common
sort
of
men
for
it
is
in
thy
power
whenever
thou
shalt
choose
to
retire
into
thyself
for
nowhere
either
with
more
quiet
or
more
freedom
from
trouble
does
a
man
retire
than
into
his
own
soul
particularly
when
he
has
within
him
such
thoughts
that
by
looking
into
them
he
is
immediately
in
perfect
tranquillity
happy
indeed
is
he
who
has
such
a
sanctuary
in
his
own
soul
he
who
is
virtuous
is
wise
and
he
who
is
wise
is
good
and
he
who
is
good
is
happy
but
we
can
not
expect
to
be
happy
if
we
do
not
lead
pure
and
useful
lives
to
be
good
company
for
ourselves
we
must
store
our
minds
well
fill
them
with
pure
and
peaceful
thoughts
with
pleasant
memories
of
the
past
and
reasonable
hopes
for
the
future
we
must
as
far
as
may
be
protect
ourselves
from
from
care
and
from
anxiety
we
shall
make
our
lives
pure
and
peaceful
by
resisting
evil
by
placing
restraint
upon
our
appetites
and
perhaps
even
more
by
strengthening
and
developing
our
tendencies
to
good
we
must
be
careful
then
on
what
we
allow
our
minds
to
dwell
the
soul
is
dyed
by
its
thoughts
we
can
not
keep
our
minds
pure
if
we
allow
them
to
be
sullied
by
detailed
accounts
of
crime
and
sin
peace
of
mind
as
ruskin
beautifully
observes
must
come
in
its
own
time
as
the
waters
settle
themselves
into
clearness
as
well
as
quietness
you
can
no
more
filter
your
mind
into
purity
than
you
can
compress
it
into
calmness
you
must
keep
it
pure
if
you
would
have
it
pure
and
throw
no
stones
into
it
if
you
would
have
it
quiet
the
penalty
of
injustice
said
socrates
is
not
death
or
stripes
but
the
fatal
necessity
of
becoming
more
and
more
unjust
few
men
have
led
a
wiser
or
more
virtuous
life
than
socrates
himself
of
whom
xenophon
gives
us
the
following
description
to
me
being
such
as
i
have
described
him
so
pious
that
he
did
nothing
without
the
sanction
of
the
gods
so
just
that
he
wronged
no
man
even
in
the
most
trifling
affair
but
was
of
service
in
the
most
important
matters
to
those
who
enjoyed
his
society
so
temperate
that
he
never
preferred
pleasure
to
virtue
so
wise
that
he
never
erred
in
distinguishing
better
from
worse
needing
no
counsel
from
others
but
being
sufficient
in
himself
to
discriminate
between
them
so
able
to
explain
and
settle
such
questions
by
argument
and
so
capable
of
discerning
the
character
of
others
of
confuting
those
who
were
in
error
and
of
exhorting
them
to
virtue
and
honor
he
seemed
to
be
such
as
the
best
and
happiest
of
men
would
be
but
if
any
one
disapproves
of
my
opinion
let
him
compare
the
conduct
of
others
with
that
of
socrates
and
determine
accordingly
marcus
aurelius
again
has
drawn
for
us
a
most
instructive
lesson
in
his
character
of
antoninus
remember
his
constancy
in
every
act
which
was
conformable
to
reason
his
evenness
in
all
things
his
piety
the
serenity
of
his
countenance
his
sweetness
his
disregard
of
empty
fame
and
his
efforts
to
understand
things
how
he
would
never
let
anything
pass
without
having
first
carefully
examined
it
and
clearly
understood
it
how
he
bore
with
those
who
blamed
him
unjustly
without
blaming
them
in
return
how
he
did
nothing
in
a
hurry
how
he
listened
not
to
calumnies
and
how
exact
an
examiner
of
manners
and
actions
he
was
not
given
to
reproach
people
nor
timid
nor
suspicious
nor
a
sophist
with
how
little
he
was
satisfied
such
as
lodging
bed
dress
food
servants
how
laborious
and
patient
how
sparing
he
was
in
his
diet
his
firmness
and
uniformity
in
his
friendships
how
he
tolerated
freedom
of
speech
in
those
who
opposed
his
opinions
the
pleasure
that
he
had
when
any
man
showed
him
anything
better
and
how
pious
he
was
without
superstition
imitate
all
this
that
thou
mayest
have
as
good
a
conscience
when
thy
last
hour
comes
as
he
had
such
peace
of
mind
is
indeed
an
inestimable
boon
a
rich
reward
of
duty
fulfilled
well
then
does
epictetus
ask
is
there
no
reward
do
you
seek
a
reward
greater
than
that
of
doing
what
is
good
and
just
at
olympia
you
wish
for
nothing
more
but
it
seems
to
you
enough
to
be
crowned
at
the
games
does
it
then
seem
to
you
so
small
and
worthless
a
thing
to
be
good

happy

than
golde
old
english
song
of
all
the
privileges
we
enjoy
in
this
nineteenth
century
there
is
none
perhaps
for
which
we
ought
to
be
more
thankful
than
for
the
easier
access
to
books
the
debt
we
owe
to
books
was
well
expressed
by
richard
de
bury
bishop
of
durham
author
of
written
as
long
ago
as
published
in
and
the
earliest
english
treatise
on
the
delights
of
literature
these
he
says
are
the
masters
who
instruct
us
without
rods
and
ferules
without
hard
words
and
anger
without
clothes
or
money
if
you
approach
them
they
are
not
asleep
if
investigating
you
interrogate
them
they
conceal
nothing
if
you
mistake
them
they
never
grumble
if
you
are
ignorant
they
can
not
laugh
at
you
the
library
therefore
of
wisdom
is
more
precious
than
all
riches
and
nothing
that
can
be
wished
for
is
worthy
to
be
compared
with
it
whosoever
therefore
acknowledges
himself
to
be
a
zealous
follower
of
truth
of
happiness
of
wisdom
of
science
or
even
of
the
faith
must
of
necessity
make
himself
a
lover
of
books
but
if
the
debt
were
great
then
how
much
more
now
this
feeling
that
books
are
real
friends
is
constantly
present
to
all
who
love
reading
i
have
friends
said
petrarch
whose
society
is
extremely
agreeable
to
me
they
are
of
all
ages
and
of
every
country
they
have
distinguished
themselves
both
in
the
cabinet
and
in
the
field
and
obtained
high
honors
for
their
knowledge
of
the
sciences
it
is
easy
to
gain
access
to
them
for
they
are
always
at
my
service
and
i
admit
them
to
my
company
and
dismiss
them
from
it
whenever
i
please
they
are
never
troublesome
but
immediately
answer
every
question
i
ask
them
some
relate
to
me
the
events
of
past
ages
while
others
reveal
to
me
the
secrets
of
nature
some
teach
me
how
to
live
and
others
how
to
die
some
by
their
vivacity
drive
away
my
cares
and
exhilarate
my
spirits
while
others
give
fortitude
to
my
mind
and
teach
me
the
important
lesson
how
to
restrain
my
desires
and
to
depend
wholly
on
myself
they
open
to
me
in
short
the
various
avenues
of
all
the
arts
and
sciences
and
upon
their
information
i
may
safely
rely
in
all
emergencies
in
return
for
all
their
services
they
only
ask
me
to
accommodate
them
with
a
convenient
chamber
in
some
corner
of
my
humble
habitation
where
they
may
repose
in
peace
for
these
friends
are
more
delighted
by
the
tranquillity
of
retirement
than
with
the
tumults
of
society
he
that
loveth
a
book
says
isaac
barrow
will
never
want
a
faithful
friend
a
wholesome
counsellor
a
cheerful
companion
an
effectual
comforter
by
study
by
reading
by
thinking
one
may
innocently
divert
and
pleasantly
entertain
himself
as
in
all
weathers
so
in
all
fortunes
southey
took
a
rather
more
melancholy
view
my
days
among
the
dead
are
pass
around
me
i
behold
these
casual
eyes
are
cast
the
mighty
minds
of
old
my
friends
are
they
with
whom
i
converse
day
by
day
imagine
in
the
words
of
aikin
that
we
had
it
in
our
power
to
call
up
the
shades
of
the
greatest
and
wisest
men
that
ever
existed
and
oblige
them
to
converse
with
us
on
the
most
interesting
topics
what
an
inestimable
privilege
should
we
think
it
how
superior
to
all
common
enjoyments
but
in
a
library
we
in
fact
possess
this
power
we
can
question
xenophon
and
caesar
on
their
campaigns
make
demosthenes
and
cicero
plead
before
us
join
in
the
audiences
of
socrates
and
plato
and
receive
demonstrations
from
euclid
and
newton
in
books
we
have
the
choicest
thoughts
of
the
ablest
men
in
their
best
dress
books
says
jeremy
collier
are
a
guide
in
youth
and
an
entertainment
for
age
they
support
us
under
solitude
and
keep
us
from
being
a
burthen
to
ourselves
they
help
us
to
forget
the
crossness
of
men
and
things
compose
our
cares
and
our
passions
and
lay
our
disappointments
asleep
when
we
are
weary
of
the
living
we
may
repair
to
the
dead
who
have
nothing
of
peevishness
pride
or
design
in
their
conversation
sir
john
herschel
tells
an
amusing
anecdote
illustrating
the
pleasure
derived
from
a
book
not
assuredly
of
the
first
order
in
a
certain
village
the
blacksmith
having
got
hold
of
richardson
novel
or
virtue
used
to
sit
on
his
anvil
in
the
long
summer
evenings
and
read
it
aloud
to
a
large
and
attentive
audience
it
is
by
no
means
a
short
book
but
they
fairly
listened
to
it
all
at
length
when
the
happy
turn
of
fortune
arrived
which
brings
the
hero
and
heroine
together
and
sets
them
living
long
and
happily
together
according
to
the
most
approved
rules
the
congregation
were
so
delighted
as
to
raise
a
great
shout
and
procuring
the
church
keys
actually
set
the
parish
bells
the
lover
of
reading
says
leigh
hunt
will
derive
agreeable
terror
from

the
will
assent
with
delighted
reason
to
every
sentence

and
with
the
shipwrecked
mariner
of
carlyle
has
wisely
said
that
a
collection
of
books
is
a
real
university
the
importance
of
books
has
been
appreciated
in
many
quarters
where
we
might
least
expect
it
among
the
hardy
norsemen
runes
were
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
miraculous
power
there
is
an
arabic
proverb
that
a
wise
man
day
is
worth
a
fool
life
and
another
though
it
reflects
perhaps
rather
the
spirit
of
the
califs
than
of
the
sultans
that
the
ink
of
science
is
more
precious
than
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
confucius
is
said
to
have
described
himself
as
a
man
who
in
his
eager
pursuit
of
knowledge
forgot
his
food
who
in
the
joy
of
its
attainment
forgot
his
sorrows
and
did
not
even
perceive
that
old
age
was
coming
on
yet
if
this
could
be
said
by
the
arabs
and
the
chinese
what
language
can
be
strong
enough
to
express
the
gratitude
we
ought
to
feel
for
the
advantages
we
enjoy
we
do
not
appreciate
i
think
our
good
fortune
in
belonging
to
the
nineteenth
century
sometimes
indeed
one
may
even
be
inclined
to
wish
that
one
had
not
lived
quite
so
soon
and
to
long
for
a
glimpse
of
the
books
even
the
of
one
hundred
years
hence
a
hundred
years
ago
not
only
were
books
extremely
expensive
and
cumbrous
but
many
of
the
most
delightful
were
still
uncreated
such
as
the
works
of
scott
thackeray
dickens
bulwer
lytton
and
trollope
not
to
mention
living
authors
how
much
more
interesting
science
has
become
especially
if
i
were
to
mention
only
one
name
through
the
genius
of
darwin
renan
has
characterized
this
as
a
most
amusing
century
i
should
rather
have
described
it
as
most
interesting
presenting
us
as
it
does
with
an
endless
vista
of
absorbing
problems
with
infinite
opportunities
with
more
interest
and
less
danger
than
surrounded
our
less
fortunate
ancestors
cicero
described
a
room
without
books
as
a
body
without
a
soul
but
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
be
a
philosopher
to
love
reading
reading
indeed
is
by
no
means
necessarily
study
far
from
it
i
put
says
frederic
harrison
in
his
excellent
article
on
the
choice
of
books
i
put
the
poetic
and
emotional
side
of
literature
as
the
most
needed
for
daily
use
in
the
prologue
to
the
of
goode

says
and
as
for
me
though
that
i
konne

and
to

give

feyth

and
in

have
him
in

so
hertely
that
ther

and
that
the
floures
gynnen
for
to
sprynge
farwel
my
boke
and
my
devocion
but
i
doubt
whether
if
he
had
enjoyed
our
advantages
he
could
have
been
so
certain
of
tearing
himself
away
even
in
the
month
of
may
macaulay
who
had
all
that
wealth
and
fame
rank
and
talents
could
give
yet
we
are
told
derived
his
greatest
happiness
from
books
sir
trevelyan
in
his
charming
biography
says
that
of
the
feelings
which
macaulay
entertained
toward
the
great
minds
of
bygone
ages
it
is
not
for
any
one
except
himself
to
speak
he
has
told
us
how
his
debt
to
them
was
incalculable
how
they
guided
him
to
truth
how
they
filled
his
mind
with
noble
and
graceful
images
how
they
stood
by
him
in
all
vicissitudes
comforters
in
sorrow
nurses
in
sickness
companions
in
solitude
the
old
friends
who
are
never
seen
with
new
faces
who
are
the
same
in
wealth
and
in
poverty
in
glory
and
in
obscurity
great
as
were
the
honors
and
possessions
which
macaulay
acquired
by
his
pen
all
who
knew
him
were
well
aware
that
the
titles
and
rewards
which
he
gained
by
his
own
works
were
as
nothing
in
the
balance
compared
with
the
pleasure
he
derived
from
the
works
of
others
there
was
no
society
in
london
so
agreeable
that
macaulay
would
have
preferred
it
at
breakfast
or
at
dinner
to
the
company
of
sterne
or
fielding
horace
walpole
or

the
love
of
reading
which
gibbon
declared
he
would
not
exchange
for
all
the
treasures
of
india
was
in
fact
with
macaulay
a
main
element
of
happiness
in
one
of
the
happiest
lives
that
it
has
ever
fallen
to
the
lot
of
the
biographer
to
record
history
says
fuller
maketh
a
young
man
to
be
old
without
either
wrinkles
or
gray
hair
privileging
him
with
the
experience
of
age
without
either
the
infirmities
or
the
inconveniences
thereof
so
delightful
indeed
are
books
that
we
must
be
careful
not
to
forget
other
duties
for
them
in
cultivating
the
mind
we
must
not
neglect
the
body
to
the
lover
of
literature
or
science
exercise
often
presents
itself
as
an
irksome
duty
and
many
a
one
has
felt
like
the
fair
pupil
of
ascham
lady
jane
gray
who
while
the
horns
were
sounding
and
dogs
in
full
cry
sat
in
the
lonely
oriel
with
eyes
riveted
to
that
immortal
page
which
tells
how
meekly
and
bravely
socrates
the
first
martyr
of
intellectual
liberty
took
the
cup
from
his
weeping
jailer
still
as
the
late
lord
derby
justly
observed
those
who
do
not
find
time
for
exercise
will
have
to
find
time
for
illness
books
again
are
now
so
cheap
as
to
be
within
the
reach
of
almost
every
one
this
was
not
always
so
it
is
quite
a
recent
blessing
ireland
to
whose
charming
little
lover
in
common
with
every
lover
of
reading
i
am
greatly
indebted
tells
us
that
when
a
boy
he
was
so
delighted
with
white
history
of
that
in
order
to
possess
a
copy
of
his
own
he
actually
copied
out
the
whole
work
mary
lamb
gives
a
pathetic
description
of
a
studious
boy
lingering
at
a
bookstall
i
saw
a
boy
with
eager
eye
open
a
book
upon
a
stall
and
read
as
he
devour
it
all
which
when
the
stall
man
did
espy
soon
to
the
boy
i
heard
him
call
sir
you
never
buy
a
book
therefore
in
one
you
shall
not
look
the
boy
passed
slowly
on
and
with
a
sigh
he
wished
he
never
had
been
taught
to
read
then
of
the
old
churl
books
he
should
have
had
no
need
such
snatches
of
literature
have
indeed
special
and
peculiar
charm
this
is
i
believe
partly
due
to
the
very
fact
of
their
being
brief
many
readers
miss
much
of
the
pleasure
of
reading
by
forcing
themselves
to
dwell
too
long
continuously
on
one
subject
in
a
long
railway
journey
for
instance
many
persons
take
only
a
single
book
the
consequence
is
that
unless
it
is
a
story
after
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
they
are
quite
tired
of
it
whereas
if
they
had
two
or
still
better
three
books
on
different
subjects
and
one
of
them
of
an
amusing
character
they
would
probably
find
that
by
changing
as
soon
as
they
felt
at
all
weary
they
would
come
back
again
and
again
to
each
with
renewed
zest
and
hour
after
hour
would
pass
pleasantly
away
every
one
of
course
must
judge
for
himself
but
such
at
least
is
my
experience
i
quite
agree
therefore
with
lord
iddesleigh
as
to
the
charm
of
desultory
reading
but
the
wider
the
field
the
more
important
that
we
should
benefit
by
the
very
best
books
in
each
class
not
that
we
need
confine
ourselves
to
them
but
that
we
should
commence
with
them
and
they
will
certainly
lead
us
on
to
others
there
are
of
course
some
books
which
we
must
read
mark
learn
and
inwardly
digest
but
these
are
exceptions
as
regards
by
far
the
larger
number
it
is
probably
better
to
read
them
quickly
dwelling
only
on
the
best
and
most
important
passages
in
this
way
no
doubt
we
shall
lose
much
but
we
gain
more
by
ranging
over
a
wider
field
we
may
in
fact
i
think
apply
to
reading
lord
wise
dictum
as
regards
education
and
say
that
it
is
well
to
read
everything
of
something
and
something
of
everything
in
this
way
only
we
can
ascertain
the
bent
of
our
own
tastes
for
it
is
a
general
though
not
of
course
an
invariable
rule
that
we
profit
little
by
books
which
we
do
not
enjoy
every
one
however
may
suit
himself
the
variety
is
endless
not
only
does
a
library
contain
infinite
riches
in
a
little
room
but
we
may
sit
at
home
and
yet
be
in
all
quarters
of
the
earth
we
may
travel
round
the
world
with
captain
cook
or
darwin
with
kingsley
or
ruskin
who
will
show
us
much
more
perhaps
than
ever
we
should
see
for
ourselves
the
world
itself
has
no
limits
for
us
humboldt
and
herschel
will
carry
us
far
away
to
the
mysterious
nebulae
beyond
the
sun
and
even
the
stars
time
has
no
more
bounds
than
space
history
stretches
out
behind
us
and
geology
will
carry
us
back
for
millions
of
years
before
the
creation
of
man
even
to
the
origin
of
the
material
universe
itself
nor
are
we
limited
to
one
plane
of
thought
aristotle
and
plato
will
transport
us
into
a
sphere
none
the
less
delightful
because
we
can
not
appreciate
it
without
some
training
comfort
and
consolation
refreshment
and
happiness
may
indeed
be
found
in
his
library
by
any
one
who
shall
bring
the
golden
key
that
unlocks
its
silent
door
a
library
is
true
fairyland
a
very
palace
of
delight
a
haven
of
repose
from
the
storms
and
troubles
of
the
world
rich
and
poor
can
enjoy
it
equally
for
here
at
least
wealth
gives
no
advantage
we
may
make
a
library
if
we
do
but
rightly
use
it
a
true
paradise
on
earth
a
garden
of
eden
without
its
one
drawback
for
all
is
open
to
us
including
and
especially
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
for
which
we
are
told
that
our
first
mother
sacrificed
all
the
pleasures
of
paradise
here
we
may
read
the
most
important
histories
the
most
exciting
volumes
of
travels
and
adventures
the
most
interesting
stories
the
most
beautiful
poems
we
may
meet
the
most
eminent
statesmen
poets
and
philosophers
benefit
by
the
ideas
of
the
greatest
thinkers
and
enjoy
the
grandest
creations
of
human
genius

chapter
iv
the
choice
of
books
all
round
the
room
my
silent
servants
wait
my
friends
in
every
season
bright
and
dim
angels
and
seraphim
come
down
and
murmur
to
me
sweet
and
low
and
spirits
of
the
skies
all
come
and
go
early
and
late
proctor
and
yet
too
often
they
wait
in
vain
one
reason
for
this
is
i
think
that
people
are
overwhelmed
by
the
crowd
of
books
offered
to
them
in
old
days
books
were
rare
and
dear
now
on
the
contrary
it
may
be
said
with
greater
truth
than
ever
that
words
are
things
and
a
small
drop
of
ink
falling
like
dew
upon
a
thought
produces
that
which
makes
thousands
perhaps
millions
think
our
ancestors
had
a
difficulty
in
procuring
them
our
difficulty
now
is
what
to
select
we
must
be
careful
what
we
read
and
not
like
the
sailors
of
ulysses
take
bags
of
wind
for
sacks
of
treasure
not
only
lest
we
should
even
now
fall
into
the
error
of
the
greeks
and
suppose
that
language
and
definitions
can
be
instruments
of
investigation
as
well
as
of
thought
but
lest
as
too
often
happens
we
should
waste
time
over
trash
there
are
many
books
to
which
one
may
apply
in
the
sarcastic
sense
the
ambiguous
remark
said
to
have
been
made
to
an
unfortunate
author
i
will
lose
no
time
in
reading
your
book
there
are
indeed
books
and
books
and
there
are
books
which
as
lamb
said
are
not
books
at
all
it
is
wonderful
how
much
innocent
happiness
we
thoughtlessly
throw
away
an
eastern
proverb
says
that
calamities
sent
by
heaven
may
be
avoided
but
from
those
we
bring
on
ourselves
there
is
no
escape
many
i
believe
are
deterred
from
attempting
what
are
called
stiff
books
for
fear
they
should
not
understand
them
but
there
are
few
who
need
complain
of
the
narrowness
of
their
minds
if
only
they
would
do
their
best
with
them
in
reading
however
it
is
most
important
to
select
subjects
in
which
one
is
interested
i
remember
years
ago
consulting
darwin
as
to
the
selection
of
a
course
of
study
he
asked
me
what
interested
me
most
and
advised
me
to
choose
that
subject
this
indeed
applies
to
the
work
of
life
generally
i
am
sometimes
disposed
to
think
that
the
readers
of
the
next
generation
will
be
not
our
lawyers
and
doctors
shopkeepers
and
manufacturers
but
the
laborers
and
mechanics
does
not
this
seem
natural
the
former
work
mainly
with
their
head
when
their
daily
duties
are
over
the
brain
is
often
exhausted
and
of
their
leisure
time
much
must
be
devoted
to
air
and
exercise
the
laborer
and
mechanic
on
the
contrary
besides
working
often
for
much
shorter
hours
have
in
their
taken
sufficient
bodily
exercise
and
could
therefore
give
any
leisure
they
might
have
to
reading
and
study
they
have
not
done
so
as
yet
it
is
true
but
this
has
been
for
obvious
reasons
now
however
in
the
first
place
they
receive
an
excellent
education
in
elementary
schools
and
in
the
second
have
more
easy
access
to
the
best
books
ruskin
has
observed
that
he
does
not
wonder
at
what
men
suffer
but
he
often
wonders
at
what
they
lose
we
suffer
much
no
doubt
from
the
faults
of
others
but
we
lose
much
more
by
our
own
ignorance
if
says
sir
john
herschel
i
were
to
pray
for
a
taste
which
should
stand
me
in
stead
under
every
variety
of
circumstances
and
be
a
source
of
happiness
and
cheerfulness
to
me
through
life
and
a
shield
against
its
ills
however
things
might
go
amiss
and
the
world
frown
upon
me
it
would
be
a
taste
for
reading
i
speak
of
it
of
course
only
as
a
worldly
advantage
and
not
in
the
slightest
degree
as
superseding
or
derogating
from
the
higher
office
and
surer
and
stronger
panoply
of
religious
principles
but
as
a
taste
and
instrument
and
a
mode
of
pleasurable
gratification
give
a
man
this
taste
and
the
means
of
gratifying
it
and
you
can
hardly
fail
of
making
a
happy
man
unless
indeed
you
put
into
his
hands
a
most
perverse
selection
of
books
it
is
one
thing
to
own
a
library
it
is
quite
another
to
use
it
wisely
i
have
often
been
astonished
how
little
care
people
devote
to
the
selection
of
what
they
read
books
we
know
are
almost
innumerable
our
hours
for
reading
are
alas
very
few
and
yet
many
people
read
almost
by
hazard
they
will
take
any
book
they
chance
to
find
in
a
room
at
a
friend
house
they
will
buy
a
novel
at
a
if
it
has
an
attractive
title
indeed
i
believe
in
some
cases
even
the
binding
affects
their
choice
the
selection
is
no
doubt
far
from
easy
i
have
often
wished
some
one
would
recommend
a
list
of
a
hundred
good
books
if
we
had
such
lists
drawn
up
by
a
few
good
guides
they
would
be
most
useful
i
have
indeed
sometimes
heard
it
said
that
in
reading
every
one
must
choose
for
himself
but
this
reminds
me
of
the
recommendation
not
to
go
into
the
water
till
you
can
swim
in
the
absence
of
such
lists
i
have
picked
out
the
books
most
frequently
mentioned
with
approval
by
those
who
have
referred
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
pleasure
of
reading
and
have
ventured
to
include
some
which
though
less
frequently
mentioned
are
especial
favorites
of
my
own
every
one
who
looks
at
the
list
will
wish
to
suggest
other
books
as
indeed
i
should
myself
but
in
that
case
the
number
would
soon
run
up
i
have
abstained
for
obvious
reasons
from
mentioning
works
by
living
authors
though
from
many
of
them
tennyson
ruskin
and
others
i
have
myself
derived
the
keenest
enjoyment
and
i
have
omitted
works
on
science
with
one
or
two
exceptions
because
the
subject
is
so
progressive
i
feel
that
the
attempt
is
over
bold
and
i
must
beg
for
indulgence
while
hoping
for
criticism
indeed
one
object
which
i
have
had
in
view
is
to
stimulate
others
more
competent
far
than
i
am
to
give
us
the
advantage
of
their
opinions
moreover
i
must
repeat
that
i
suggest
these
works
rather
as
those
which
as
far
as
i
have
seen
have
been
most
frequently
recommended
than
as
suggestions
of
my
own
though
i
have
slipped
in
a
few
of
my
own
special
favorites
in
any
such
selection
much
weight
should
i
think
be
attached
to
the
general
verdict
of
mankind
there
is
a
struggle
for
existence
and
a
survival
of
the
fittest
among
books
as
well
as
among
animals
and
plants
as
alonzo
of
aragon
said
age
is
a
recommendation
in
four
things
old
wood
to
burn
old
wine
to
drink
old
friends
to
trust
and
old
books
to
read
still
this
can
not
be
accepted
without
important
qualifications
the
most
recent
books
of
history
and
science
contain
or
ought
to
contain
the
most
accurate
information
and
the
most
trustworthy
conclusions
moreover
while
the
books
of
other
races
and
times
have
an
interest
from
their
very
distance
it
must
be
admitted
that
many
will
still
more
enjoy
and
feel
more
at
home
with
those
of
our
own
century
and
people
yet
the
oldest
books
of
the
world
are
remarkable
and
interesting
on
account
of
their
very
age
and
the
works
which
have
influenced
the
opinions
or
charmed
the
leisure
hours
of
millions
of
men
in
distant
times
and
regions
are
well
worth
reading
on
that
very
account
even
if
to
us
they
seem
scarcely
to
deserve
their
reputation
it
is
true
that
to
many
such
works
are
accessible
only
in
translations
but
translations
though
they
can
never
perhaps
do
justice
to
the
original
may
yet
be
admirable
in
themselves
the
bible
itself
which
must
stand
first
in
the
list
is
a
conclusive
case
at
the
head
of
all
moralists
i
must
place
the
of
epictetus
certainly
one
of
the
noblest
books
in
the
whole
of
literature
it
has
moreover
been
admirably
translated
with
epictetus
i
think
must
come
marcus
aurelius
the
of
confucius
will
i
believe
prove
disappointing
to
most
english
readers
but
the
effect
it
has
produced
on
the
most
numerous
race
of
men
constitutes
in
itself
a
peculiar
interest
the
of
aristotle
perhaps
appear
to
some
disadvantage
from
the
very
fact
that
they
have
so
profoundly
influenced
our
views
of
morality
the
like
the
of
confucius
will
to
most
of
us
derive
its
principal
interest
from
the
effect
it
has
exercised
and
still
exercises
on
so
many
millions
of
our
i
doubt
whether
in
any
other
respect
it
will
seem
to
repay
perusal
and
to
most
persons
probably
certain
extracts
not
too
numerous
would
appear
sufficient
the
writings
of
the
apostolic
fathers
have
been
collected
in
one
volume
by
wake
it
is
but
a
small
one
and
though
i
must
humbly
confess
that
i
was
disappointed
they
are
perhaps
all
the
more
curious
from
the
contrast
they
afford
to
those
of
the
apostles
themselves
of
the
later
fathers
i
have
included
only
the
of
augustine
which
pusey
selected
for
the
commencement
of
the
of
the
and
which
as
he
observes
has
been
translated
again
and
again
into
almost
every
european
language
and
in
all
loved
though
luther
was
of
opinion
that
augustine
wrote
nothing
to
the
purpose
concerning
faith
but
then
luther
was
no
great
admirer
of
the
father
jerome
he
says
writes
alas
very
coldly
chrysostom
digresses
from
the
chief
points
jerome
is
very
poor
and
in
fact
he
says
the
more
i
read
the
books
of
the
fathers
the
more
i
find
myself
offended
while
renan
in
his
interesting
autobiography
compared
theology
to
a
gothic
cathedral
elle
a
la
grandeur
les
vides
immenses
et
le
peu
de
solidité
among
other
devotional
works
most
frequently
recommended
are
thomas
ŕ
kempis
of
pascal
spinoza
butler
of
jeremy
living
and
bunyan
and
last
not
least
keble
beautiful
aristotle
and
plato
again
stand
at
the
head
of
another
class
the
of
aristotle
and
plato
if
not
the
whole
at
any
rate
the
the
and
the
will
be
of
course
read
by
all
who
wish
to
know
anything
of
the
history
of
human
thought
though
i
am
heretical
enough
to
doubt
whether
the
latter
repays
the
minute
and
laborious
study
often
devoted
to
it
aristotle
being
the
father
if
not
the
creator
of
the
modern
scientific
method
it
has
followed
naturally
indeed
almost
inevitably
that
his
principles
have
become
part
of
our
very
intellectual
being
so
that
they
seem
now
almost
while
his
actual
observations
though
very
remarkable
as
for
instance
when
he
observes
that
bees
on
one
journey
confine
themselves
to
one
kind
of
flower
still
have
been
in
many
cases
superseded
by
others
carried
on
under
more
favorable
conditions
we
must
not
be
ungrateful
to
the
great
master
because
his
lessons
have
taught
us
how
to
advance
plato
on
the
other
hand
i
say
so
with
all
respect
seems
to
me
in
some
cases
to
play
on
words
his
arguments
are
very
able
very
philosophical
often
very
noble
but
not
always
conclusive
in
a
language
differently
constructed
they
might
sometimes
tell
in
exactly
the
opposite
sense
if
this
method
has
proved
less
fruitful
if
in
metaphysics
we
have
made
but
little
advance
that
very
fact
in
one
point
of
view
leaves
the
of
socrates
as
instructive
now
as
ever
they
were
while
the
problems
with
which
they
deal
will
always
rouse
our
interest
as
the
calm
and
lofty
spirit
which
inspires
them
must
command
our
admiration
of
the
and
the
especially
it
would
be
impossible
to
speak
too
gratefully
i
would
also
mention
demosthenes
which
lord
brougham
pronounced
the
greatest
oration
of
the
greatest
of
orators
lucretius
plutarch
lives
horace
and
at
least
the
and
of
cicero
the
great
epics
of
the
world
have
always
constituted
one
of
the
most
popular
branches
of
literature
yet
how
few
comparatively
ever
read
homer
or
virgil
after
leaving
school
the
our
great
epic
is
perhaps
too
much
neglected
no
doubt
on
account
of
its
painful
character
brunhild
and
kriemhild
indeed
are
far
from
perfect
but
we
meet
with
few
such
live
women
in
greek
or
roman
literature
nor
must
i
omit
to
mention
sir
malory
though
i
confess
i
do
so
mainly
in
deference
to
the
judgment
of
others
among
the
greek
tragedians
i
include
aeschylus
if
not
all
his
works
at
any
rate
perhaps
the
sublimest
poem
in
greek
literature
and
the
symonds
in
his
speaks
of
the
unrivalled
majesty
of
the
and
mark
pattison
considered
it
the
grandest
work
of
creative
genius
in
the
whole
range
of
literature
or
as
sir
grant
duff
recommends
the
sophocles
euripides
and
aristophanes
and
unfortunately
as
schlegel
says
probably
even
the
greatest
scholar
does
not
understand
half
his
jokes
and
i
think
most
modern
readers
will
prefer
our
modern
poets
i
should
like
moreover
to
say
a
word
for
eastern
poetry
such
as
portions
of
the
and
too
long
probably
to
be
read
through
but
of
which
talboys
wheeler
has
given
a
most
interesting
epitome
in
the
first
two
volumes
of
his
of
the
the
work
of
the
great
persian
poet
firdusi
and
the
sheking
the
classical
collection
of
ancient
chinese
odes
many
i
know
will
think
i
ought
to
have
included
omar
khayyam
in
history
we
are
beginning
to
feel
that
the
vices
and
vicissitudes
of
kings
and
queens
the
dates
of
battles
and
wars
are
far
less
important
than
the
development
of
human
thought
the
progress
of
art
of
science
and
of
law
and
the
subject
is
on
that
very
account
even
more
interesting
than
ever
i
will
however
only
mention
and
that
rather
from
a
literary
than
a
historical
point
of
view
herodotus
xenophon
the
thucydides
and
tacitus
and
of
modern
historians
and
the
splendid
bridge
from
the
old
world
to
the
new
hume
of
carlyle
of
and
green
history
of
the
english
science
is
so
rapidly
progressive
that
though
to
many
minds
it
is
the
most
fruitful
and
interesting
subject
of
all
i
can
not
here
rest
on
that
agreement
which
rather
than
my
own
opinion
i
take
as
the
basis
of
my
list
i
will
therefore
only
mention
bacon
and
darwin
of
in
political
economy
which
some
of
our
rulers
do
not
now
sufficiently
value
mill
and
parts
of
smith
of
for
probably
those
who
do
not
intend
to
make
a
special
study
of
political
economy
would
scarcely
read
the
whole
among
voyages
and
travels
perhaps
those
most
frequently
suggested
are
cook
humboldt
and
darwin
though
i
confess
i
should
like
to
have
added
many
more
mr
bright
not
long
ago
specially
recommended
the
less
known
american
poets
but
he
probably
assumed
that
every
one
would
have
read
shakespeare
milton
and
minor
poems
chaucer
dante
spencer
dryden
scott
wordsworth
pope
byron
and
others
before
embarking
on
more
doubtful
adventures
among
other
books
most
frequently
recommended
are
goldsmith

defoe
arabian
boswell

the

nor

my

suggest
thackeray

ask
in
return
for
my
trouble
to
be
allowed
as
a
special
favor
to
count
as
one
to
any
lover

back
a

delicious
memories

by

for
general
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
some
one
would
publish
a
selection
from
the
works
of
seneca
chapter
the
blessing
of
friends
they
seem
to
take
away
the
sun
from
the
world
who
withdraw
friendship
from
life
for
we
have
received
nothing
better
from
the
immortal
gods
nothing
more
cicero
most
of
those
who
have
written
in
praise
of
books
have
thought
they
could
say
nothing
more
conclusive
than
to
compare
them
to
friends
all
men
said
socrates
have
their
different
objects
of
ambition
horses
dogs
money
honor
as
the
case
may
be
but
for
his
own
part
he
would
rather
have
a
good
friend
than
all
these
put
together
and
again
men
know
the
number
of
their
other
possessions
although
they
might
be
very
numerous
but
of
their
friends
though
but
few
they
were
not
only
ignorant
of
the
number
but
even
when
they
attempted
to
reckon
it
to
such
as
asked
them
they
set
aside
again
some
that
they
had
previously
counted
among
their
friends
so
little
did
they
allow
their
friends
to
occupy
their
thoughts
yet
in
comparison
with
what
possession
of
all
others
would
not
a
good
friend
appear
far
more
valuable
as
to
the
value
of
other
things
says
cicero
most
men
differ
concerning
friendship
all
have
the
same
opinion
what
can
be
more
foolish
than
when
men
are
possessed
of
great
influence
by
their
wealth
power
and
resources
to
procure
other
things
which
are
bought
by
money
horses
slaves
rich
apparel
costly
vases
and
not
to
procure
friends
the
most
valuable
and
fairest
furniture
of
life
and
yet
he
continues
every
man
can
tell
how
many
goats
or
sheep
he
possesses
but
not
how
many
friends
in
the
choice
moreover
of
a
dog
or
of
a
horse
we
exercise
the
greatest
care
we
inquire
into
its
pedigree
its
training
and
character
and
yet
we
too
often
leave
the
selection
of
our
friends
which
is
of
infinitely
greater
importance
by
whom
our
whole
life
will
be
more
or
less
influenced
either
for
good
or
evil
almost
to
chance
it
is
no
doubt
true
as
the
of
the
breakfast
says
that
all
men
are
bores
except
when
we
want
them
and
sir
thomas
browne
quaintly
observes
that
unthinking
heads
who
have
not
learnt
to
be
alone
are
a
prison
to
themselves
if
they
be
not
with
others
whereas
on
the
contrary
those
whose
thoughts
are
in
a
fair
and
hurry
within
are
sometimes
fain
to
retire
into
company
to
be
out
of
the
crowd
of
themselves
still
i
do
not
quite
understand
emerson
idea
that
men
descend
to
meet
in
another
place
indeed
he
qualifies
the
statement
and
says
almost
all
people
descend
to
meet
even
so
i
should
venture
to
question
it
especially
considering
the
context
all
association
he
adds
must
be
a
compromise
and
what
is
worse
the
very
flower
and
aroma
of
the
flower
of
each
of
the
beautiful
natures
disappears
as
they
approach
each
other
what
a
sad
thought
is
it
really
so
need
it
be
so
and
if
it
were
would
friends
be
any
real
advantage
i
should
have
thought
that
the
influence
of
friends
was
exactly
the
reverse
that
the
flower
of
a
beautiful
nature
would
expand
and
the
colors
grow
brighter
when
stimulated
by
the
warmth
and
sunshine
of
friendship
it
has
been
said
that
it
is
wise
always
to
treat
a
friend
remembering
that
he
may
become
an
enemy
and
an
enemy
remembering
that
he
may
become
a
friend
and
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
first
part
of
the
adage
there
is
certainly
much
wisdom
in
the
latter
many
people
seem
to
take
more
pains
and
more
pleasure
in
making
enemies
than
in
making
friends
plutarch
indeed
quotes
with
approbation
the
advice
of
pythagoras
not
to
shake
hands
with
too
many
but
as
long
as
friends
are
well
chosen
it
is
true
rather
that
he
who
has
a
thousand
friends
has
never
a
one
to
spare
and
he
who
has
one
enemy
will
meet
him
everywhere
and
unfortunately
while
there
are
few
great
friends
there
is
no
little
enemy
i
guard
myself
however
by
saying
again
as
long
as
they
are
well
chosen
one
is
thrown
in
life
with
a
great
many
people
who
though
not
actively
bad
though
they
may
not
wilfully
lead
us
astray
yet
take
no
pains
with
themselves
neglect
their
own
minds
and
direct
the
conversation
to
petty
puerilities
or
mere
gossip
who
do
not
seem
to
realize
that
conversation
may
by
a
little
effort
be
made
most
instructive
and
delightful
without
being
in
any
way
pedantic
or
on
the
other
hand
may
be
allowed
to
drift
into
a
mere
morass
of
muddy
thought
and
weedy
words
there
is
hardly
anyone
from
whom
we
may
not
learn
much
if
only
they
will
trouble
themselves
to
tell
us
nay
even
if
they
teach
us
nothing
they
may
help
us
by
the
stimulus
of
intelligent
questions
or
the
warmth
of
sympathy
but
if
they
do
neither
then
indeed
their
companionship
if
companionship
it
can
be
called
is
mere
waste
of
time
and
of
such
we
may
well
say
i
do
desire
that
we
be
better
strangers
much
certainly
of
the
happiness
and
purity
of
our
lives
depends
on
our
making
a
wise
choice
of
our
companions
and
friends
if
our
friends
are
badly
chosen
they
will
inevitably
drag
us
down
if
well
they
will
raise
us
up
yet
many
people
seem
to
trust
in
this
matter
to
the
chapter
of
accident
it
is
well
and
right
indeed
to
be
courteous
and
considerate
to
every
one
with
whom
we
are
brought
into
contact
but
to
choose
them
as
real
friends
is
another
matter
some
seem
to
make
a
man
a
friend
or
try
to
do
so
because
he
lives
near
because
he
is
in
the
same
business
travels
on
the
same
line
of
railway
or
for
some
other
trivial
reason
there
can
not
be
a
greater
mistake
these
are
only
in
the
words
of
plutarch
the
idols
and
images
of
friendship
to
be
friendly
with
every
one
is
another
matter
we
must
remember
that
there
is
no
little
enemy
and
those
who
have
ever
really
loved
any
one
will
have
some
tenderness
for
all
there
is
indeed
some
good
in
most
men
i
have
heard
much
says
nasmyth
in
his
charming
autobiography
about
the
ingratitude
and
selfishness
of
the
world
it
may
have
been
my
good
fortune
but
i
have
never
experienced
either
of
these
unfeeling
conditions
such
also
has
been
my
own
experience
men
talk
of
unkind
hearts
kind
deeds
with
coldness
still
returning
alas
the
gratitude
of
men
has
oftener
left
me
mourning
i
can
not
then
agree
with
emerson
that
we
walk
alone
in
the
world
friends
such
as
we
desire
are
dreams
and
fables
but
a
sublime
hope
cheers
ever
the
faithful
heart
that
elsewhere
in
other
regions
of
the
universal
power
souls
are
now
acting
enduring
and
daring
which
can
love
us
and
which
we
can
love
no
doubt
much
as
worthy
friends
add
to
the
happiness
and
value
of
life
we
must
in
the
main
depend
on
ourselves
and
every
one
is
his
own
best
friend
or
worst
enemy
sad
indeed
is
bacon
assertion
that
there
is
little
friendship
in
the
world
and
least
of
all
between
equals
which
was
wont
to
be
magnified
that
that
is
is
between
superior
and
inferior
whose
fortunes
may
comprehend
the
one
to
the
other
but
this
can
hardly
be
taken
as
his
deliberate
opinion
for
he
elsewhere
says
but
we
may
go
farther
and
affirm
most
truly
that
it
is
a
mere
and
miserable
solitude
to
want
true
friends
without
which
the
world
is
but
a
wilderness
not
only
he
adds
does
friendship
introduce
daylight
in
the
understanding
out
of
darkness
and
confusion
of
thoughts
it
maketh
a
fair
day
in
the
affections
from
storm
and
tempests
in
consultation
with
a
friend
a
man
tosseth
his
thoughts
more
easily
he
marshalleth
them
more
orderly
he
seeth
how
they
look
when
they
are
turned
into
words
finally
he
waxeth
wiser
than
himself
and
that
more
by
an
hour
discourse
than
by
a
but
little
do
men
perceive
what
solitude
is
and
how
far
it
extendeth
for
a
crowd
is
not
company
and
faces
are
but
a
gallery
of
pictures
and
talk
but
a
tinkling
cymbal
where
there
is
no
love
with
this
last
assertion
i
can
not
altogether
concur
surely
even
strangers
may
be
most
interesting
and
many
will
agree
with
johnson
when
describing
a
pleasant
evening
he
summed
it
up
sir
we
had
a
good
talk
epictetus
gives
excellent
advice
when
he
dissuades
from
conversation
on
the
very
subjects
most
commonly
chosen
and
advises
that
it
should
be
on
none
of
the
common
subjects
not
about
gladiators
nor
nor
about
athletes
nor
about
eating
or
drinking
which
are
the
usual
subjects
and
especially
not
about
men
as
blaming
them
but
when
he
adds
or
praising
them
the
injunction
seems
to
me
of
doubtful
value
surely
marcus
aurelius
more
wisely
advises
that
when
thou
wishest
to
delight
thyself
think
of
the
virtues
of
those
who
live
with
thee
for
instance
the
activity
of
one
and
the
modesty
of
another
and
the
liberality
of
a
third
and
some
other
good
quality
of
a
fourth
for
nothing
delights
so
much
as
the
examples
of
the
virtues
when
they
are
exhibited
in
the
morals
of
those
who
live
with
us
and
present
themselves
in
abundance
as
far
as
is
possible
wherefore
we
must
keep
them
before
us
yet
how
often
we
know
merely
the
sight
of
those
we
call
our
friends
or
the
sound
of
their
voices
but
nothing
whatever
of
their
mind
or
soul
we
must
moreover
be
as
careful
to
keep
friends
as
to
make
them
if
every
one
knew
what
one
said
of
the
other
pascal
assures
us
that
there
would
not
be
four
friends
in
the
world
this
i
hope
and
think
is
too
strong
but
at
any
rate
try
to
be
one
of
the
four
and
when
you
have
made
a
friend
keep
him
hast
thou
a
friend
says
an
eastern
proverb
visit
him
often
for
thorns
and
brushwood
obstruct
the
road
which
no
one
treads
the
affections
should
not
be
mere
tents
of
a
night
still
less
does
friendship
confer
any
privilege
to
make
ourselves
disagreeable
some
people
never
seem
to
appreciate
their
friends
till
they
have
lost
them
anaxagoras
described
the
mausoleum
as
the
ghost
of
wealth
turned
into
stone
but
he
who
has
once
stood
beside
the
grave
to
look
back
on
the
companionship
which
has
been
for
ever
closed
feeling
how
impotent
are
the
wild
love
and
the
keen
sorrow
to
give
one
instant
pleasure
to
the
pulseless
heart
or
atone
in
the
lowest
measure
to
the
departed
spirit
for
the
hour
of
unkindness
will
scarcely
for
the
future
incur
that
debt
to
the
heart
which
can
only
be
discharged
to
the
dust
death
indeed
can
not
sever
friendship
friends
says
cicero
though
absent
are
still
present
though
in
poverty
they
are
rich
though
weak
yet
in
the
enjoyment
of
health
and
what
is
still
more
difficult
to
assert
though
dead
they
are
alive
this
seems
a
paradox
yet
it
there
not
much
truth
in
his
explanation
to
me
indeed
scipio
still
lives
and
will
always
live
for
i
love
the
virtue
of
that
man
and
that
worth
is
not
yet
extinguished
assuredly
of
all
things
that
either
fortune
or
time
has
bestowed
on
me
i
have
none
which
i
can
compare
with
the
friendship
of
scipio
if
then
we
choose
our
friends
for
what
they
are
not
for
what
they
have
and
if
we
deserve
so
great
a
blessing
then
they
will
be
always
with
us
preserved
in
absence

even
after
death

the

of

each

all

the

or
the

if
we

of
the

says

in

the

we
forego

can
not
retrieve
and
in
the
words
of
dante
for
who
knows
most

loss
of

most
grieves
not
that
a

of
drudgery
should
be
our
ideal
far
from
it
time
spent
in
innocent
and
rational
enjoyments
in
healthy
games
in
social
and
family
intercourse
is
well
and
wisely
spent
games
not
only
keep
the
body
in
health
but
give
a
command
over
the
muscles
and
limbs
which
can
not
be
overvalued
moreover
there
are
temptations
which
strong
exercise
best
enables
us
to
resist
it
is
the
idle
who
complain
they
can
not

to
do
that
which
they
fancy
they
wish
in

people
can
generally
make
time
for
what
they
choose
to
do
it
is
not
really
the
time
but
the
will
that
is
wanting
and
the
advantage
of
leisure
is
mainly
that
we
may
have
the
power
of
choosing
our
own
work
not
certainly
that
it

any

we

that

acting
well
idleness
says
jeremy
taylor
is
the
greatest
prodigality
in
the
world
it
throws
away
that
which
is
invaluable
in
respect
of
its
present
use
and
irreparable
when
it
is
past
being
to
be
recovered
by
no
power
of
art
or
nature
life
must
be
measured
rather
by
depth
than
by
length
by
thought
and
action
rather
than
by
time
a
counted
number
of
pulses
only
says
pater
is
given
to
us
of
a
variegated
aromatic
life
how
may
we
see
in
them
all
that
is
to
be
seen
by
the
finest
senses
how
can
we
pass
most
swiftly
from
point
to
point
and
be
present
always
at
the
focus
where
the
greatest
number
of
vital
forces
unite
in
their
purest
energy
to
burn
always
with
this
hard
flame
to
maintain
this
ecstasy
is
success
in
life
failure
is
to
form
habits
for
habit
is
relation
to
a
stereotyped
world
while
all
melts
under
our
feet
we
may
well
catch
at
any
exquisite
passion
or
any
contribution
to
knowledge
that
seems
by
a
lifted
horizon
to
set
the
spirit
free
for
a
moment
i
would
not
quote
lord
chesterfield
as
generally
a
safe
guide
but
there
is
certainly
much
shrewd
wisdom
in
his
advice
to
his
son
with
reference
to
time
every
moment
you
now
lose
is
so
much
character
and
advantage
lost
as
on
the
other
hand
every
moment
you
now
employ
usefully
is
so
much
time
wisely
laid
out
at
prodigious
interest
and
again
it
is
astonishing
that
any
one
can
squander
away
in
absolute
idleness
one
single
moment
of
that
small
portion
of
time
which
is
allotted
to
us
in
the
world
know
the
true
value
of
time
snatch
seize
and
enjoy
every
moment
of
it
are
you
in
earnest
seize
this
very
minute
what
you
can
do
or
think
you
can
begin
it
there
is
a
turkish
proverb
that
the
devil
tempts
the
idle
man
but
the
idle
man
tempts
the
devil
i
remember
says
hilliard
a
satirical
poem
in
which
the
devil
is
represented
as
fishing
for
men
and
adapting
his
bait
to
the
tastes
and
temperaments
of
his
prey
but
the
idlers
were
the
easiest
victims
for
they
swallowed
even
the
naked
hook
the
mind
of
the
idler
indeed
preys
upon
itself
the
human
heart
is
like
a
millstone
in
a
mill
when
you
put
wheat
under
it
it
turns
and
grinds
and
bruises
the
wheat
to
flour
if
you
put
no
wheat
it
still
grinds
on
and
grinds
itself
away
it
is
not
work
but
care
that
kills
and
it
is
in
this
sense
i
suppose
that
we
are
told
to
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
to
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
and
yet
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
wherefore
if
god
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field
which
is
and
is
cast
into
the
oven
shall
he
not
much
more
clothe
you
o
ye
of
little
faith
it
would
indeed
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
lilies
are
idle
or
imprudent
on
the
contrary
plants
are
most
industrious
and
lilies
store
up
in
their
complex
bulbs
a
great
part
of
the
nourishment
of
one
year
to
quicken
the
growth
of
the
next
care
on
the
other
hand
they
certainly
know
not
hours
have
wings
fly
up
to
the
author
of
time
and
carry
news
of
our
usage
all
our
prayers
can
not
entreat
one
of
them
either
to
return
or
slacken
his
pace
the
misspents
of
every
minute
are
a
new
record
against
us
in
heaven
sure
if
we
thought
thus
we
should
dismiss
them
with
better
reports
and
not
suffer
them
to
fly
away
empty
or
laden
with
dangerous
intelligence
how
happy
is
it
when
they
carry
up
not
only
the
messages
but
the
fruits
of
good
and
stay
with
the
ancient
of
days
to
speak
for
us
before
his
glorious
throne
time
is
often
said
to
fly
but
it
is
not
so
much
the
time
that
flies
as
we
that
waste
it
and
wasted
time
is
worse
than
no
time
at
all
i
wasted
time
shakespeare
makes
richard
ii
say
and
now
doth
time
waste
me
he
that
is
choice
of
his
time
says
jeremy
taylor
will
also
be
choice
of
his
company
and
choice
of
his
actions
lest
the
first
engage
him
in
vanity
and
loss
and
the
latter
by
being
criminal
be
a
throwing
his
time
and
himself
away
and
a
going
back
in
the
accounts
of
eternity
the
life
of
man
is
seventy
years
but
how
little
of
this
is
actually
our
own
we
must
deduct
the
time
required
for
sleep
for
meals
for
dressing
and
undressing
for
exercise
and
then
how
little
remains
really
at
our
own
disposal
i
have
lived
said
lamb
nominally
fifty
years
but
deduct
from
them
the
hours
i
have
lived
for
other
people
and
not
for
myself
and
you
will
find
me
still
a
young
fellow
the
hours
we
live
for
other
people
however
are
not
those
that
should
be
deducted
but
rather
those
which
benefit
neither
oneself
nor
any
one
else
and
these
alas
are
often
very
numerous
there
are
some
hours
which
are
taken
from
us
some
which
are
stolen
from
us
and
some
which
slip
from
us
but
however
we
may
lose
them
we
can
never
get
them
back
it
is
wonderful
indeed
how
much
innocent
happiness
we
thoughtlessly
throw
away
an
eastern
proverb
says
that
calamities
sent
by
heaven
may
be
avoided
but
from
those
we
bring
on
ourselves
there
is
no
escape
some
years
ago
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
principal
lake
villages
of
switzerland
in
company
with
a
distinguished
archaeologist
morlot
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
his
whole
income
was
a
year
part
of
which
moreover
he
spent
in
making
a
small
museum
i
asked
him
whether
he
contemplated
accepting
any
post
or
office
but
he
said
certainly
not
he
valued
his
leisure
and
opportunities
as
priceless
possessions
far
more
than
silver
or
gold
and
would
not
waste
any
of
his
time
in
making
money
time
indeed
is
a
sacred
gift
and
each
day
is
a
little
life
just
think
of
our
advantages
here
in
london
we
have
access
to
the
whole
literature
of
the
world
we
may
see
in
our
national
gallery
the
most
beautiful
productions
of
former
generations
and
in
the
royal
academy
and
other
galleries
the
works
of
the
greatest
living
artists
perhaps
there
is
no
one
who
has
ever
found
time
to
see
the
british
museum
thoroughly
yet
consider
what
it
contains
or
rather
what
does
it
not
contain
the
most
gigantic
of
living
and
extinct
animals
the
marvellous
monsters
of
geological
ages
the
most
beautiful
birds
shells
and

the
pleasures
of
travel
i
am
a
part
of
all
that
i
have
tennyson
i
am
sometimes
disposed
to
think
that
there
are
few
things
in
which
we
of
this
generation
enjoy
greater
advantages
over
our
ancestors
than
in
the
increased
facilities
of
travel
but
i
hesitate
to
say
this
not
because
our
advantages
are
not
great
but
because
i
have
already
made
the
same
remark
with
reference
to
several
other
aspects
of
life
the
very
word
travel
is
suggestive
it
is
a
form
of
travail
excessive
labor
and
as
skeat
observes
it
forcibly
recalls
the
toil
of
travel
in
olden
days
how
different
things
are
now
it
is
sometimes
said
that
every
one
should
travel
on
foot
like
thales
plato
and
pythagoras
we
are
told
that
in
these
days
of
railroads
people
rush
through
countries
and
see
nothing
it
may
be
so
but
that
is
not
the
fault
of
the
railways
they
confer
upon
us
the
inestimable
advantage
of
being
able
so
rapidly
and
with
so
little
fatigue
to
visit
countries
which
were
much
less
accessible
to
our
ancestors
what
a
blessing
it
is
that
not
our
own
islands
only
our
smiling
fields
and
rich
woods
the
mountains
that
are
full
of
peace
and
the
rivers
of
joy
the
lakes
and
heaths
and
hills
castles
and
cathedrals
and
many
a
spot
immortalized
in
the
history
of
our
country
not
these
only
but
the
sun
and
scenery

south

alps
the
palaces
of
nature
the
blue
mediterranean
and
the
cities
of
europe
with
all
their
memories
and
treasures
are
now
brought
within
a
few
hours
of
us
surely
no
one
who
has
the
opportunity
should
omit
to
travel
the
world
belongs
to
him
who
has
seen
it
but
he
that
would
make
his
travels
delightful
must
first
make
himself
delightful
according
to
the
old
proverb
the
fool
wanders
the
wise
man
travels
bacon
tells
us
that
the
things
to
be
seen
and
observed
are
the
courts
of
princes
especially
when
they
give
audience
to
ambassadors
the
courts
of
justice
while
they
sit
and
hear
causes
and
so
of
consistories
ecclesiastic
the
churches
and
monasteries
with
the
monuments
which
are
therein
extant
the
walls
and
fortifications
of
cities
and
towns
and
so
the
havens
and
harbors
antiquities
and
ruins
libraries
colleges
disputations
and
lectures
when
any
are
shipping
and
navies
houses
and
gardens
of
state
and
pleasure
near
great
cities
armories
arsenals
magazines
exchanges
burses
warehouses
exercises
of
horsemanship
fencing
training
of
soldiers
and
the
like
comedies
such
whereunto
the
better
sort
of
persons
do
resort
treasuries
of
jewels
and
robes
cabinets
and
rarities
and
to
conclude
whatsoever
is
memorable
in
the
places
where
they
go
but
this
depends
on
the
time
at
our
disposal
and
the
object
with
which
we
travel
if
we
can
stay
long
in
any
one
place
bacon
advice
is
no
doubt
excellent
but
for
the
moment
i
am
thinking
rather
of
an
annual
holiday
taken
for
the
sake
of
rest
and
health
for
fresh
air
and
exercise
rather
than
for
study
yet
even
so
if
we
have
eyes
to
see
we
can
not
fail
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
new
ideas
as
well
as
a
store
of
health
we
may
have
read
the
most
vivid
and
accurate
description
we
may
have
pored
over
maps
and
plans
and
pictures
and
yet
the
reality
will
burst
on
us
like
a
revelation
this
is
true
not
only
of
mountains
and
glaciers
of
palaces
and
cathedrals
but
even
of
the
simplest
examples
for
instance
like
every
one
else
i
had
read
descriptions
and
seen
photographs
and
pictures
of
the
pyramids
their
form
is
simplicity
itself
i
do
not
know
that
i
could
put
into
words
any
characteristic
of
the
original
for
which
i
was
not
prepared
it
was
not
that
they
were
larger
it
was
not
that
they
differed
in
form
in
color
or
situation
and
yet
the
moment
i
saw
them
i
felt
that
my
previous
impression
had
been
but
a
faint
shadow
of
the
reality
the
actual
sight
seemed
to
give
life
to
the
idea
every
one
who
has
been
in
the
east
will
agree
that
a
week
of
oriental
travel
brings
out
with
more
than
stereoscopic
effect
the
pictures
of
patriarchal
life
as
given
us
in
the
old
testament
and
what
is
true
of
the
old
testament
is
true
of
history
generally
to
those
who
have
been
in
athens
or
rome
the
history
of
greece
or
italy
becomes
far
more
interesting
while
on
the
other
hand
some
knowledge
of
the
history
and
literature
enormously
enhances
the
interest
of
the
scenes
themselves
good
descriptions
and
pictures
however
help
us
to
see
much
more
than
we
should
perhaps
perceive
for
ourselves
it
may
even
be
doubted
whether
some
persons
do
not
derive
a
more
correct
impression
from
a
good
drawing
or
description
which
brings
out
the
salient
points
than
they
would
from
actual
but
unaided
inspection
the
idea
may
gain
in
accuracy
in
character
and
even
in
detail
more
than
it
misses
in
vividness
but
however
this
may
be
for
those
who
can
not
travel
descriptions
and
pictures
have
an
immense
interest
while
to
those
who
traveled
they
will
afford
an
inexhaustible
delight
in
reviving
the
memories
of
beautiful
scenes
and
interesting
expeditions
it
is
really
astonishing
how
little
most
of
us
see
of
the
beautiful
world
in
which
we
live
norman
lockyer
tells
me
that
while
traveling
on
a
scientific
mission
in
the
rocky
mountains
he
was
astonished
to
meet
an
aged
french
abbé
and
could
not
help
showing
his
surprise
the
abbé
observed
this
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
explained
his
presence
in
that
distant
region
you
were
he
said
i
easily
saw
surprised
to
find
me
here
the
fact
is
that
some
months
ago
i
was
very
my
physicians
gave
me
up
one
morning
i
seemed
to
faint
and
thought
that
i
was
already
in
the
arms
of
the
bon
dieu
i
fancied
one
of
the
angels
came
and
asked
me
how
did
you
like
the
beautiful
world
you
have
just
left
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
who
had
been
all
my
life
preaching
about
heaven
had
seen
almost
nothing
of
the
world
in
which
i
was
living
i
determined
therefore
if
it
pleased
providence
to
spare
me
to
see
something
of
this
world
and
so
here
i
am
few
of
us
are
free
however
much
we
might
wish
it
to
follow
the
example
of
the
worthy
abbé
but
although
it
may
not
be
possible
for
us
to
reach
the
rocky
mountains
there
are
other
countries
nearer
home
which
most
of
us
might
find
time
to
visit
though
it
is
true
that
no
descriptions
can
come
near
the
reality
they
may
at
least
persuade
us
to
give
ourselves
this
great
advantage
let
me
then
try
to
illustrate
this
by
pictures
in
words
as
realized
by
one
of
our
most
illustrious
countrymen
i
will
select
references
to
foreign
countries
only
not
that
we
have
not
equal
beauties
here
but
because
everywhere
in
england
one
feels
oneself
at
home
the
following
passage
from
hours
of
exercise
in
the
is
almost
as
good
as
an
hour
in
the
alps
themselves
i
looked
over
this
wondrous
scene
toward
mont
blanc
the
grand
combin
the
dent
blanche
the
weisshorn
the
dom
and
the
thousand
lesser
peaks
which
seem
to
join
in
the
celebration
of
the
risen
day
i
asked
myself
as
on
previous
occasions
how
was
this
colossal
work
performed
who
chiselled
these
mighty
and
picturesque
masses
out
of
a
mere
protuberance
of
the
earth
and
the
answer
was
at
hand
ever
young
ever
the
vigor
of
a
thousand
worlds
still
within
real
sculptor
was
even
then
climbing
up
the
eastern
sky
it
was
he
who
raised
aloft
the
waters
which
cut
out
these
ravines
it
was
he
who
planted
the
glaciers
on
the
mountain
slopes
thus
giving
gravity
a
plough
to
open
out
the
valleys
and
it
is
he
who
acting
through
the
ages
will
finally
lay
low
these
mighty
monuments
rolling
them
gradually
seaward
sowing
the
seeds
of
continents
to
be
so
that
the
people
of
an
older
earth
may
see
mould
spread
and
corn
wave
over
the
hidden
rocks
which
at
this
moment
bear
the
weight
of
the
jungfrau
and
the
alps
lie
within
hours
of
london
tyndall
writings
also
contain
many
vivid
descriptions
of
glaciers
those
silent
and
solemn
causeways
broad
enough
for
the
march
of
an
army
in
line
of
battle
and
quiet
as
a
street
of
tombs
in
a
buried
city
i
do
not
however
borrow
from
him
or
from
any
one
else
any
description
of
glaciers
for
they
are
so
unlike
anything
else
that
no
one
who
has
not
seen
can
possibly
visualize
them
the
history
of
european
rivers
yet
remains
to
be
written
and
is
most
interesting
they
did
not
always
run
in
their
present
courses
the
rhone
for
instance
appears
to
have
been
itself
a
great
traveler
at
least
there
seems
reasons
to
believe
that
the
upper
waters
of
the
valais
fell
at
first
into
the
danube
and
so
into
the
black
sea
subsequently
joined
the
rhine
and
the
thames
and
so
ran
far
north
over
the
plains
which
once
connected
the
mountains
of
scotland
and
of
norway
to
the
arctic
ocean
and
to
have
only
comparatively
of
late
years
adopted
their
present
course
into
the
mediterranean
but
however
this
may
be
the
rhine
of
germany
and
the
rhine
of
switzerland
are
very
unlike
the
catastrophe
of
schaffhausen
seems
to
alter
the
whole
character
of
the
river
and
no
wonder
stand
for
half
an
hour
says
ruskin
beside
the
fall
of
schaffhausen
on
the
north
side
where
the
rapids
are
long
and
watch
how
the
vault
of
water
first
bends
unbroken
in
pure
polished
velocity
over
the
arching
rocks
at
the
brow
of
the
cataract
covering
them
with
a
dome
of
crystal
twenty
feet
thick
so
swift
that
its
motion
is
unseen
except
when
a
foam
globe
from
above
darts
over
it
like
a
falling
star
and
how
ever
and
anon
startling
you
with
its
white
flash
a
jet
of
spray
leaps
hissing
out
of
the
fall
like
a
rocket
bursting
in
the
wind
and
driven
away
in
dust
filling
the
air
with
light
and
how
through
the
curdling
wreaths
of
the
restless
crushing
abyss
below
the
blue
of
the
water
paled
by
the
foam
in
its
body
shows
purer
than
the
sky
through
white
their
dripping
masses
lifted
at
intervals
like
sheaves
of
loaded
corn
by
some
stronger
gush
from
the
cataract
and
bowed
again
upon
the
mossy
rocks
as
its
roar
dies
away
but
much
as
we
may
admire
the
majestic
grandeur
of
a
mighty
river
either
in
its
eager
rush
or
its
calmer
moments
there
is
something
which
fascinates
even
more
in
the
free
life
the
young
energy
the
sparkling
transparence
and
merry
music
of
smaller
streams
the
upper
swiss
valleys
as
the
same
great
seer
says
are
sweet
with
perpetual
streamlets
that
seem
always
to
have
chosen
the
steepest
places
to
come
down
for
the
sake
of
the
leaps
scattering
their
handfuls
of
crystal
this
way
and
that
as
the
winds
take
them
with
all
the
grace
but
with
none
of
the
formalism
of
fountains
until
at
last
they
find
their
way
down
to
the
turf
and
lose
themselves
in
that
silently
with
quiet
depth
of
clear
water
furrowing
among
the
grass
blades
and
looking
only
like
their
shadow
but
presently
emerging
again
in
little
startled
gushes
and
laughing
hurries
as
if
they
had
remembered
suddenly
that
the
day
was
too
short
for
them
to
get
down
the
hill
how
vividly
does
symonds
bring
before
us
the
sunny
shores
of
the
mediterranean
which
he
loves
so
well
and
the
contrast
between
the
scenery
of
the
north
and
the
south
in
northern
landscapes
the
eye
travels
through
vistas
of
leafy
boughs
to
still
secluded
crofts
and
pastures
where
oxen
graze
the
mystery
of
dreams
and
the
repose
of
meditation
haunt
our
massive
bowers
but
in
the
south
the
of
olive
boughs
and
foliage
scarcely
veils
the
laughing
sea
and
bright
blue
sky
while
the
hues
of
the
landscape
find
their
climax
in
the
dazzling
radiance
of
the
sun
upon
the
waves
and
the
pure
light
of
the
horizon
there
is
no
concealment
and
no
melancholy
here
nature
seems
to
hold
a
festival
and
dance
in
which
the
waves
and
sunbeams
and
shadows
join
again
in
northern
scenery
the
rounded
forms
of
trees
suit
the
undulating
country
with
its
gentle
hills
and
brooding
clouds
but
in
the
south
the
spiky
leaves
and
sharp
branches
of
the
olive
carry
out
the
defined
outlines
which
are
everywhere
observable
through
the
broader
beauties
of
mountain
and
valley
and
serenity
and
intelligence
characterize
this
southern
landscape
in
which
a
race
of
splendid
men
and
women
lived
beneath
the
pure
light
of
phoebus
their
ancestral
god
pallas
protected
them
and
golden
aphrodite
favored
them
with
beauty
olives
are
not
however
by
any
means
the
only
trees
which
play
a
part
in
idyllic
scenery
the
tall
stone
pine
is
even
more
important
near
massa
by
sorrento
there
are
two
gigantic
pines
so
placed
that
lying
on
the
grass
beneath
them
one
looks
on
capri
rising
from
the
sea
baiae
and
all
the
bay
of
naples
sweeping
round
to
the
base
of
vesuvius
tangled
growths
of
olives
and
fill
the
along
the
shore
while
far
away
in
the
distance
pale
inarime
sleeps
with
her
exquisite
greek
name
a
virgin
island
on
the
deep
on
the
wilder
hills
you
find
patches
of
ilex
and
arbutus
glowing
with
crimson
berries
and
white
waxen
bells
sweet
myrtle
rods
and
shafts
of
bay
frail
tamarisk
and
tall
that
wave
their
frosted
boughs
above
your
head
nearer
the
shore
the
lentisk
grows
a
savory
shrub
with
cytisus
and
aromatic
rosemary
clematis
and
polished
garlands
of
tough
sarsaparilla
wed
the
shrubs
with
clinging
climbing
arms
and
here
and
there
in
sheltered
nooks
the
vine
shoots
forth
luxuriant
tendrils
bowed
with
grapes
stretching
from
branch
to
branch
of
mulberry
or
elm
flinging
festoons
on
which
young
loves
might
sit
and
swing
or
weaving
a
of
leaves
across
the
open
shed
nor
must
the
sounds
of
this
landscape
be
forgotten
sounds
of
bleating
flocks
and
murmuring
bees
and
nightingales
and
doves
that
moan
and
running
streams
and
shrill
cicadas
and
hoarse
frogs
and
whispering
pines
there
is
not
a
single
detail
which
a
patient
student
may
not
verify
from
theocritus
then
too
it
is
a
landscape
in
which
sea
and
country
are
never
sundered
the
higher
we
climb
upon
the
the
more
marvellous
is
the
beauty
of
the
sea
which
seems
to
rise
as
we
ascend
and
stretch
into
the
sky
sometimes
a
little
flake
of
blue
is
framed
by
olive
boughs
sometimes
a
turning
in
the
road
reveals
the
whole
broad
azure
calm
below
or
after
toiling
up
a
steep
ascent
we
fall
upon
the
undergrowth
of
juniper
and
lo
a
double
sea
this
way
and
that
divided
by
the
sharp
spine
of
the
jutting
hill
jewelled
with
villages
along
its
shore
and
smiling
with
fair
islands
and
silver
sails
to
many
of
us
the
mere
warmth
of
the
south
is
a
blessing
and
a
delight
the
very
thought
of
it
is
delicious
i
have
read
over
again
and
again
wallace
graphic
description
of
a
tropical
sunrise
of
the
sun
of
the
early
morning
that
turneth
all
into
gold
up
to
about
a
quarter
past
five
he
says
the
darkness
is
complete
but
about
that
time
a
few
cries
of
birds
begin
to
break
the
silence
of
night
perhaps
indicating
that
signs
of
dawn
are
perceptible
in
the
eastern
horizon
a
little
later
the
melancholy
voices
of
the
goatsuckers
are
heard
varied
croakings
of
frogs
the
plaintive
whistle
of
mountain
thrushes
and
strange
cries
of
birds
or
mammals
peculiar
to
each
locality
about
five
the
first
glimmer
of
light
becomes
perceptible
it
slowly
becomes
lighter
and
then
increases
so
rapidly
that
at
about
a
quarter
to
six
it
seems
full
daylight
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
this
changes
very
little
in
character
when
suddenly
the
rim
appears
above
the
horizon
decking
the
foliage
with
glittering
gems
sending
gleams
of
golden
light
far
into
the
woods
and
waking
up
all
nature
to
life
and
activity
birds
chirp
and
flutter
about
parrots
scream
monkeys
chatter
bees
hum
among
the
flowers
and
gorgeous
butterflies
flutter
lazily
along
or
sit
with
full
expanded
wings
exposed
to
the
warm
and
invigorating
rays
the
first
hour
of
morning
in
the
equatorial
regions
possesses
a
charm
and
a
beauty
that
can
never
be
forgotten
all
nature
seems
refreshed
and
strengthened
by
the
coolness
and
moisture
of
the
past
night
new
leaves
and
buds
unfold
almost
before
the
eye
and
fresh
shoots
may
often
be
observed
to
have
grown
many
inches
since
the
preceding
day
the
temperature
is
the
most
delicious
conceivable
the
slight
chill
of
early
dawn
which
was
itself
agreeable
is
succeeded
by
an
invigorating
warmth
and
the
intense
sunshine
lights
up
the
glorious
vegetation
of
the
tropics
and
realizes
all
that
the
magic
art
of
the
painter
or
the
glowing
words
of
the
poet
have
pictured
as
their
ideals
of
terrestrial
beauty
or

the

the

the

with

beneath

looked
back
at
them
in
the
sunset
and
they
rose
up
in
front
of
the
background
of
the
mountain
they
seemed
indeed
as
if
they
were
part
of
it
as
if
they
belonged
to
some
natural
creation
but
i
must
not
indulge
myself
in
more
quotations
though
it
is
difficult
to
stop
such
extracts
recall
the
memory
of
many
glorious
days
for
the
advantages
of
travel
last
through
life
and
often
as
we
sit
at
home
some
bright
and
perfect
view
of
venice
of
genoa
or
of
monte
rosa
comes
back
on
you
as
full
of
repose
as
a
day
wisely
spent
in
travel
so
far
is
a
thorough
love
and
enjoyment
of
travel
from
interfering
with
the
love
of
home
that
perhaps
no
one
can
thoroughly
enjoy
his
home
who
does
not
sometimes
wander
away
they
are
like
exertion
and
rest
each
the
complement
of
the
other
so
that
though
it
may
seem
paradoxical
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
travel
is
the
return
and
no
one
who
has
not
roamed
abroad
can
realize
the
devotion
which
the
wanderer
feels
for
domiduca
the
sweet
and
gentle
goddess

the
pleasures
of
home
there
no
place
like
home
english
it
may
well
be
doubted
which
is
more
delightful
to
start
for
a
holiday
which
has
been
fully
earned
or
to
return
home
from
one
which
has
been
thoroughly
enjoyed
to
find
oneself
with
renewed
vigor
with
a
fresh
store
of
memories
and
ideas
back
once
more
by
one
own
fireside
with
one
family
friends
and
books
to
sit
at
home
says
leigh
hunt
with
an
old
folio
book
of
romantic
yet
credible
voyages
and
travels
to
read
an
old
bearded
traveller
for
its
hero
a
fireside
in
an
old
country
house
to
read
it
by
curtains
drawn
and
just
wind
enough
stirring
out
of
doors
to
make
an
accompaniment
to
the
billows
or
forests
we
are
reading
of
this
surely
is
one
of
the
perfect
moments
of
existence
it
is
no
doubt
a
great
privilege
to
visit
foreign
countries
to
travel
say
in
mexico
or
peru
or
to
cruise
among
the
pacific
islands
but
in
some
respects
the
narratives
of
early
travellers
the
histories
of
prescott
or
the
voyages
of
captain
cook
are
even
more
interesting
describing
to
us
as
they
do
a
state
of
society
which
was
then
so
unlike
ours
but
which
has
now
been
much
changed
and
europeanized
thus
we
may
make
our
daily
travels
interesting
even
though
like
those
of
the
vicar
of
wakefield
all
our
adventures
are
by
our
own
fireside
and
all
our
migrations
from
one
room
to
another
moreover
even
if
the
beauties
of
home
are
humble
they
are
still
infinite
and
a
man
may
lie
in
his
bed
like
pompey
and
his
sons
in
all
quarters
of
the
earth
it
is
then
wise
to
cultivate
a
talent
very
fortunate
for
a
man
of
my
disposition
that
of
travelling
in
my
easy
chair
of
transporting
myself
without
stirring
from
my
parlor
to
distant
places
and
to
absent
friends
of
drawing
scenes
in
my
mind
eye
and
of
peopling
them
with
the
groups
of
fancy
or
the
society
of
remembrance
we
may
indeed
secure
for
ourselves
endless
variety
without
leaving
our
own
firesides
in
the
first
place
the
succession
of
seasons
multiplies
every
home
how
different
is
the
view
from
our
windows
as
we
look
on
the
tender
green
of
spring
the
rich
foliage
of
summer
the
glorious
tints
of
autumn
or
the
delicate
tracery
of
winter
our
climate
is
so
happy
that
even
in
the
worst
months
of
the
year
calm
mornings
of
sunshine
visit
us
at
times
appearing
like
glimpses
of
departed
spring
amid
the
wilderness
of
wet
and
windy
days
that
lead
to
winter
it
is
pleasant
when
these
interludes
of
silver
light
occur
to
ride
into
the
woods
and
see
how
wonderful
are
all
the
colors
of
decay
overhead
the
elms
and
chestnuts
hang
their
wealth
of
golden
leaves
while
the
beeches
darken
into
russet
tones
and
the
wild
cherry
glows
like
wine
in
the
hedges
crimson
haws
and
scarlet
hips
are
wreathed
with
hoary
clematis
or
necklaces
of
coral
the
brambles
burn
with
flames
the
is
bronzed
to
purple
and
here
and
there
the
puts
forth
its
fruit
like
knots
of
rosy
buds
on
delicate
frail
twigs
underneath
lie
fallen
leaves
and
the
brown
brake
rises
to
our
knees
as
we
thread
the
forest
paths
nay
every
day
gives
us
a
succession
of
glorious
pictures
in
variety
it
is
remarkable
how
few
people
seem
to
derive
any
pleasure
from
the
beauty
of
the
sky
gray
after
describing
a
sunrise
how
it
began
with
a
slight
whitening
just
tinged
with
gold
and
blue
lit
up
all
at
once
by
a
little
line
of
insufferable
brightness
which
rapidly
grew
to
half
an
orb
and
so
to
a
whole
one
too
glorious
to
be
distinctly
seen
adds
i
wonder
whether
any
one
ever
saw
it
before
i
hardly
believe
it
no
doubt
from
the
dawn
of
poetry
the
splendors
of
the
morning
and
evening
skies
have
delighted
all
those
who
have
eyes
to
see
but
we
are
especially
indebted
to
ruskin
for
enabling
us
more
vividly
to
realize
these
glorious
sky
pictures
as
he
says
in
language
almost
as
brilliant
as
the
sky
itself
the
whole
heaven
from
the
zenith
to
the
horizon
becomes
one
molten
mantling
sea
of
color
and
fire
every
block
bar
turns
into
massy
gold
every
ripple
and
wave
into
unsullied
shadowless
crimson
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
colors
for
which
there
are
no
words
in
language
and
no
ideas
in
the
mind
things
which
can
only
be
conceived
while
they
are
visible
the
intense
hollow
blue
of
the
upper
sky
melting
through
it
all
showing
here
deep
and
pure
and
lightness
there
modulated
by
the
filmy
formless
body
of
the
transparent
vapor
till
it
is
lost
imperceptibly
in
its
crimson
and
gold
it
is
in
some
cases
indeed
not
color
but
conflagration
and
though
the
tints
are
richer
and
more
varied
toward
morning
and
at
sunset
the
glorious
kaleidoscope
goes
on
all
day
long
yet
it
is
a
strange
thing
how
little
in
general
people
know
about
the
sky
it
is
the
part
of
creation
in
which
nature
has
done
more
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
man
more
for
the
sole
and
evident
purpose
of
talking
to
him
and
teaching
him
than
in
any
other
of
her
works
and
it
is
just
the
part
in
which
we
least
attend
to
her
there
are
not
many
of
her
other
works
in
which
some
more
material
or
essential
purpose
than
the
mere
pleasing
of
man
is
not
answered
by
every
part
of
their
organization
but
every
essential
purpose
of
the
sky
might
so
far
as
we
know
be
answer
if
once
in
three
days
or
thereabouts
a
great
ugly
black
were
brought
up
over
the
blue
and
everything
well
watered
and
so
all
left
blue
again
till
next
time
with
perhaps
a
film
of
morning
and
evening
mist
for
dew
and
instead
of
this
there
is
not
a
moment
of
any
day
of
our
lives
when
nature
is
not
producing
scene
after
scene
picture
after
picture
glory
after
glory
and
working
still
upon
such
exquisite
and
constant
principles
of
the
most
perfect
beauty
that
it
is
quite
certain
it
is
all
done
for
us
and
intended
for
our
perpetual
pleasure
nor
does
the
beauty
end
with
the
day
it
is
nothing
to
sleep
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
where
we
have
the
globe
of
the
earth
for
our
place
of
repose
and
the
glories
of
the
heavens
for
our
spectacle
for
my
part
i
always
regret
the
custom
of
shutting
up
our
rooms
in
the
evening
as
though
there
was
nothing
worth
seeing
outside
what
however
can
be
more
beautiful
than
to
look
how
the
floor
of
heaven
is
thick
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
or
to
watch
the
moon
journeying
in
calm
and
silver
glory
through
the
night
and
even
if
we
do
not
feel
that
the
man
who
has
seen
the
rising
moon
break
out
of
the
clouds
at
midnight
has
been
present
like
an
archangel
at
the
creation
of
light
and
of
the
world
still
the
stars
say
something
significant
to
all
of
us
and
each
man
has
a
whole
hemisphere
of
them
if
he
will
but
look
up
to
counsel
and
befriend
him
for
it
is
not
so
much
as
helps
elsewhere
observes
in
guiding
us
over
the
seas
of
our
little
planet
but
out
of
the
dark
waters
of
our
own
perturbed
minds
that
we
may
make
to
ourselves
the
most
of
their
significance
indeed
how
beautiful
is
night
a
dewy
freshness
fills
the
silent
air
no
mist
obscures
nor
cloud
nor
speck
nor
stain
breaks
the
serene
of
heaven
in
glory
yonder
moon
divine
rolls
through
the
dark
blue
depths
beneath
her
steady
ray
the
desert
circle
spreads
like
the
round
ocean
girdled
with
the
sky
how
beautiful
is
night
i
have
never
wondered
at
those
who
worshipped
the
sun
and
moon
on
the
other
hand
when
all
outside
is
dark
and
cold
when
perhaps
outside
fall
the
snowflakes
lightly
through
the
night
loud
raves
the
storm
in
my
room
the
fire
glows
brightly
and
is
cosy
silent
warm
musing
sit
i
on
the
settle
by
the
firelight
cheerful
blaze
listening
to
the
busy
kettle
humming
long
forgotten
lays
for
after
all
the
true
pleasures
of
home
are
not
without
but
within
and
the
domestic
man
who
loves
no
music
so
well
as
his
own
kitchen
clock
and
the
airs
which
the
logs
sing
to
him
as
they
burn
on
the
hearth
has
solaces
which
others
never
dream
of
we
love
the
ticking
of
the
clock
and
the
flicker
of
the
fire
like
the
sound
of
the
cawing
of
rooks
not
so
much
for
any
beauty
of
their
own
as
for
their
associations
it
is
a
great
truth
that
when
we
retire
into
ourselves
we
can
call
up
what
memories
we
please
how
dear
to
this
heart
are
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
when
fond
recollection
recalls
them
to
the
orchard
the
meadow
the
wildwood
and
every
lov
spot
which
my
infancy
knew
it
is
not
so
much
the
fireside
enjoyments
and
the
of
the
lowly
roof
but
rather
according
to
the
higher
and
better
ideal
of
keble
sweet
is
the
smile
of
home
the
mutual
look
when
hearts
are
of
each
other
sure
sweet
all
the
joys
that
crowd
the
household
nook
the
haunt
of
all
affections
pure
in
ancient
times
not
only
among
savage
races
but
even
among
the
greeks
themselves
there
seems
to
have
been
but
little
family
life
what
a
contrast
was
the
home
life
of
the
greeks
as
it
seems
to
have
been
to
that
for
instance
described
by
cowley
a
home
happy
in
books
and
gardens
and
above
all
in
a
virtuous
wife
where
thou
dost
meet
both
pleasures
more
refined
and
sweet
the
fairest
garden
in
her
looks
and
in
her
mind
the
wisest
books
no
one
who
has
ever
loved
mother
or
wife
sister
or
daughter
can
read
without
astonishment
and
pity
chrysostom
description
of
woman
as
a
necessary
evil
a
natural
temptation
a
desirable
calamity
a
domestic
peril
a
deadly
fascination
and
a
painted
in
few
respects
has
mankind
made
a
greater
advance
than
in
the
relations
of
men
and
women
it
is
terrible
to
think
how
women
suffer
in
savage
life
and
even
among
the
intellectual
greeks
with
rare
exceptions
they
seem
to
have
been
treated
rather
as
housekeepers
or
playthings
than
as
the
angels
who
make
a
heaven
of
home
the
hindoo
proverb
that
you
should
never
strike
a
wife
even
with
a
flower
though
a
considerable
advance
tells
a
melancholy
tale
of
what
must
previously
have
been
in
origin
of
i
have
given
many
cases
showing
how
small
a
part
family
affection
plays
in
savage
life
here
i
will
only
mention
one
case
in
illustration
the
algonquin
north
america
language
contained
no
word
for
to
love
so
that
when
the
missionaries
translated
the
bible
into
it
they
were
obliged
to
invent
one
what
a
life
and
what
a
language
without
love
yet
in
marriage
even
the
rough
passion
of
a
savage
may
contrast
favorably
with
any
cold
calculation
which
like
the
enchanted
hoard
of
the
nibelungs
is
almost
sure
to
bring
misfortune
in
the
kalevala
the
finnish
epic
the
divine
smith
ilmarinnen
forges
a
bride
of
gold
and
silver
for
wainamoinen
who
was
pleased
at
first
to
have
so
rich
a
wife
but
soon
found
her
intolerably
cold
for
in
spite
of
fires
and
furs
whenever
he
touched
her
she
froze
him
moreover
apart
from
mere
coldness
how
much
we
suffer
from
foolish
quarrels
about
trifles
from
mere
misunderstandings
from
hasty
words
thoughtlessly
repeated
sometimes
without
the
context
or
tone
which
would
have
deprived
them
of
any
sting
how
much
would
that
charity
which
beareth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
effect
to
smooth
away
the
sorrows
of
life
and
add
to
the
happiness
of
home
home
indeed
may
be
a
sure
haven
of
repose
from
the
storms
and
perils
of
the
world
but
to
secure
this
we
must
not
be
content
to
pave
it
with
good
intentions
but
must
make
it
bright
and
cheerful
if
our
life
be
one
of
toil
and
of
suffering
if
the
world
outside
be
cold
and
dreary
what
a
pleasure
to
return
to
the
sunshine
of
happy
faces
and
the
warmth
of
hearts

can
hardly
imagine
how
much

adds
to
the

of

it
is
altogether
a
mistake
to
regard
it
as
dry

of

technical
works
descriptions
of

bear
the

relation
to

as

do
to

occasionally
indeed
science
may
destroy
some
poetical
myth
of
antiquity
such
as
the
ancient

explanation
of

that
indra
dug
out

of

in

science
is
as
wonderful

as

there
are
things
whose
strong

outshines
our

botany
for
instance
is
by

regarded
as
a

we
may

goes

one
with
something
interesting
to
tell
johnson
said
that
in
his
opinion
when
you
had
seen
one
green
field
you
had
seen
all
and
a
greater
even
than
johnson
socrates
the
very
type
of
intellect
without
science
said
he
was
always
anxious
to
learn
and
from
fields
and
trees
he
could
learn
nothing
it
has
i
know
been
said
that
botanists
love
not
the
flower
they
pluck
and
know
it
not
and
all
their
botany
is
but
latin
names
contrast
this
however
with
the
language
of
one
who
would
hardly
claim
to
be
a
master
in
botany
though
he
is
certainly
a
loving
student
consider
says
ruskin
what
we
owe
to
the
meadow
grass
to
the
covering
of
the
dark
ground
by
that
glorious
enamel
by
the
companies
of
those
soft
countless
and
peaceful
spears
of
the
field
follow
but
for
a
little
time
the
thought
of
all
that
we
ought
to
recognize
in
those
words
all
spring
and
summer
is
in
them
the
walks
by
silent
scented
paths
the
rest
in
noonday
heat
the
joy
of
the
herds
and
flocks
the
power
of
all
shepherd
life
and
meditation
the
life
of
the
sunlight
upon
the
world
falling
in
emerald
streaks
and
soft
blue
shadows
when
else
it
would
have
struck
on
the
dark
mould
or
scorching
dust
pastures
beside
the
pacing
brooks
soft
banks
and
knolls
of
lowly
hills
thymy
slopes
of
down
overlooked
by
the
blue
line
of
lifted
sea
crisp
lawns
all
dim
with
early
dew
or
smooth
in
evening
warmth
of
barred
sunshine
dinted
by
happy
feet
softening
in
their
fall
the
sound
of
loving
voices
my
own
tastes
and
studies
have
led
me
mainly
in
the
direction
of
natural
history
and
archaeology
but
if
you
love
one
science
you
can
not
but
feel
intense
interest
in
them
all
how
grand
are
the
truths
of
astronomy
prudhomme
in
a
sonnet
beautifully
translated
by
arthur
has
pictured
an
observatory
he
says
is
late
the
astronomer
in
his
lonely
height
exploring
all
the
dark
descries
afar
orbs
that
like
distant
isles
of
splendor
are
he
notices
a
comet
and
calculating
its
orbit
finds
that
it
will
return
in
a
thousand
years
the
star
will
come
it
dare
not
by
one
hour
cheat
science
or
falsify
her
calculation
men
will
have
passed
but
watchful
in
the
tower
man
shall
remain
in
sleepless
contemplation
and
should
all
men
have
perished
in
their
turn
truth
in
their
place
would
watch
that
star
return
ernest
rhys
well
says
of
a
student
chamber
strange
things
pass
nightly
in
this
little
room
all
dreary
as
it
looks
by
light
of
day
enchantment
reigns
here
when
at
evening
play
red
glimpses
through
the
pallid
gloom
and
the
true
student
in
ruskin
words
stands
on
an
eminence
from
which
he
looks
back
on
the
universe
of
god
and
forward
over
the
generations
of
men
even
if
it
be
true
that
science
was
dry
when
it
was
buried
in
huge
folios
that
is
certainly
no
longer
the
case
now
and
lord
chesterfield
wise
wish
that
minerva
might
have
three
graces
as
well
as
venus
has
been
amply
fulfilled
the
study
of
natural
history
indeed
seems
destined
to
replace
the
loss
of
what
is
not
very
happily
i
think
termed
sport
engraven
in
us
as
it
is
by
the
operation
of
thousands
of
years
during
which
man
lived
greatly
on
the
produce
of
the
chase
game
is
gradually
becoming
small
by
degrees
and
beautifully
less
our
prehistoric
ancestors
hunted
the
mammoth
the
rhinoceros
and
irish
elk
the
ancient
britons
had
the
wild
ox
the
deer
and
the
wolf
we
have
still
the
pheasant
the
partridge
the
fox
and
the
hare
but
even
these
are
becoming
scarcer
and
must
be
preserved
first
in
order
that
they
may
be
killed
afterwards
some
of
us
even
now
and
more
no
doubt
will
hereafter
satisfy
instincts
essentially
of
the
same
origin
by
the
study
of
birds
or
insects
or
even
infusoria
of
creatures
which
more
than
make
up
by
their
variety
what
they
want
in
size
emerson
avers
that
when
a
naturalist
has
got
all
snakes
and
lizards
in
his
phials
science
has
done
for
him
also
and
has
put
the
man
into
a
bottle
i
do
not
deny
that
there
are
such
cases
but
they
are
quite
exceptional
the
true
naturalist
is
no
mere
dry
collector
i
can
not
resist
although
it
is
rather
long
quoting
the
following
description
from
hudson
and
gosse
beautiful
work
on
the
rotifera
on
the
somersetshire
side
of
the
avon
and
not
far
from
clifton
is
a
little
combe
at
the
bottom
of
which
lies
an
old
its
slopes
are
covered
with
plantations
of
beech
and
fir
so
as
to
shelter
the
pond
on
three
sides
and
yet
leave
it
open
to
the
soft
breezes
and
to
the
afternoon
sun
at
the
head
of
the
combe
wells
up
a
clear
spring
which
sends
a
thread
of
water
trickling
through
a
bed
of
osiers
into
the
upper
end
of
the
pond
a
stout
stone
wall
has
been
drawn
across
the
combe
from
side
to
side
so
as
to
dam
up
the
stream
and
there
is
a
gap
in
one
corner
through
which
the
overflow
finds
its
way
in
a
miniature
cascade
down
into
the
lower
plantation
if
we
approach
the
pond
by
the
gamekeeper
path
from
the
cottage
above
we
shall
pass
through
the
plantation
and
come
unseen
right
on
the
corner
of
the
wall
so
that
one
quiet
step
will
enable
us
to
see
at
a
glance
its
whole
surface
without
disturbing
any
living
thing
that
may
be
there
far
off
at
the
upper
end
a
is
leading
her
little
brood
among
the
willows
on
the
fallen
trunk
of
an
old
beech
lying
half
way
across
the
pond
a
vole
is
sitting
erect
rubbing
his
right
ear
and
the
splash
of
a
beech
husk
just
at
our
feet
tells
of
a
squirrel
who
is
dining
somewhere
in
the
leafy
crown
above
us
but
see
the
has
spied
us
out
and
is
making
straight
for
his
hole
in
the
bank
while
the
ripple
above
him
is
the
only
thing
that
tells
of
his
silent
flight
the
has
long
ago
got
under
cover
and
the
squirrel
drops
no
more
husks
it
is
a
true
silent
pond
and
without
a
sign
of
life
but
if
retaining
sense
and
sight
we
could
shrink
into
living
atoms
and
plunge
under
the
water
of
what
a
world
of
wonders
should
we
then
form
part
we
should
find
this
fairy
kingdom
peopled
with
the
strangest
creatures
creatures
that
swim
with
their
hair
that
have
ruby
eyes
blazing
deep
in
their
necks
with
telescopic
limbs
that
now
are
withdrawn
wholly
within
their
bodies
and
now
stretched
out
to
many
times
their
own
length
here
are
some
riding
at
anchor
moored
by
delicate
threads
spun
out
from
their
toes
and
there
are
others
flashing
by
in
glass
armor
bristling
with
sharp
spikes
or
ornamented
with
bosses
and
flowing
curves
while
fastened
to
a
great
stem
is
an
animal
convolvulus
that
by
some
invisible
power
draws
a
stream
of
victims
into
its
gaping
cup
and
tears
them
to
death
with
hooked
jaws
deep
down
within
its
body
close
by
it
on
the
same
stem
is
something
that
looks
like
a
filmy
a
curious
wheelwork
runs
round
its
four
outspread
petals
and
a
chain
of
minute
things
living
and
dead
is
winding
in
and
out
of
their
curves
into
a
gulf
at
the
back
of
the
flower
what
happens
to
them
there
we
can
not
see
for
round
the
stem
is
raised
a
tube
of
balls
all
regularly
piled
on
each
other
some
creature
dashes
by
and
like
a
flash
the
flower
vanishes
within
its
tube
we
sink
still
lower
and
now
see
on
the
bottom
slow
gliding
lumps
of
jelly
that
thrust
a
shapeless
arm
out
where
they
will
and
grasping
their
prey
with
these
chance
limbs
wrap
themselves
round
their
food
to
get
a
meal
for
they
creep
without
feet
seize
without
hands
eat
without
mouths
and
digest
without
stomachs
too
many
however
still
feel
only
in
nature
that
which
we
share
with
the
weed
and
the
worm
they
love
birds
as
boys
do
that
is
they
love
throwing
stones
at
them
or
wonder
if
they
are
good
to
eat
as
the
esquimaux
asked
about
the
watch
or
treat
them
as
certain
devout
afreedee
villagers
are
said
to
have
treated
a
descendant
of
the
prophet
killed
him
in
order
to
worship
at
his
tomb
but
gradually
we
may
hope
that
the
love
of
science
the
notes
we
sound
upon
the
strings
of
nature
will
become
to
more
and
more
as
already
it
is
to
many
a
faithful
and
sacred
element
of
human
feeling
science
summons
us
to
that
cathedral
boundless
as
our
wonder
whose
quenchless
lamps
the
sun
and
moon
supply
its
choir
the
winds
and
waves
its
organ
thunder
its
dome
the
sky
where
the
untrained
eye
will
see
nothing
but
mire
and
dirt
science
will
often
reveal
exquisite
possibilities
the
mud
we
tread
under
our
feet
in
the
street
is
a
grimy
mixture
of
clay
and
sand
soot
and
water
separate
the
sand
however
as
ruskin
observes
let
the
atoms
arrange
themselves
in
peace
according
to
their
nature
and
you
have
the
opal
separate
the
clay
and
it
becomes
a
white
earth
fit
for
the
finest
porcelain
or
if
it
still
further
purifies
itself
you
have
a
sapphire
take
the
soot
and
if
properly
treated
it
will
give
you
a
diamond
while
lastly
the
water
purified
and
distilled
will
become
a
or
crystallize
into
a
lovely
star
or
again
you
may
see
as
you
will
in
any
shallow
pool
either
the
mud
lying
at
the
bottom
or
the
image
of
the
heavens
above
nay
even
if
we
imagine
beauties
and
charms
which
do
not
really
exist
still
if
we
err
at
all
it
is
better
to
do
so
on
the
side
of
charity
like
nasmyth
who
tells
us
in
his
delightful
autobiography
that
he
used
to
think
one
of
his
friends
had
a
charming
and
kindly
twinkle
and
was
one
day
surprised
to
discover
that
he
had
a
glass
eye
but
i
should
err
indeed
were
i
to
dwell
exclusively
on
science
as
lending
interest
and
charm
to
our
leisure
hours
far
from
this
it
would
be
impossible
to
overrate
the
importance
of
scientific
training
on
the
wise
conduct
of
life
science
said
the
royal
commission
of
quickens
and
cultivates
directly
the
faculty
of
observation
which
in
very
many
persons
lies
almost
dormant
through
life
the
power
of
accurate
and
rapid
generalization
and
the
mental
habit
of
method
and
arrangement
it
accustoms
young
persons
to
trace
the
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
it
familiarizes
them
with
a
kind
of
reasoning
which
interests
them
and
which
they
can
promptly
comprehend
and
it
is
perhaps
the
best
corrective
for
that
indolence
which
is
the
vice
of
minds
and
which
shrinks
from
any
exertion
that
is
not
like
an
effort
of
memory
merely
mechanical
again
when
we
contemplate
the
grandeur
of
science
if
we
transport
ourselves
in
imagination
back
into
primeval
times
or
away
into
the
immensity
of
space
our
little
troubles
and
sorrows
seem
to
shrink
into
insignificance
ah
beautiful
creations
says
helps
speaking
of
the
stars
it
is
not
in
guiding
us
over
the
seas
of
our
little
planet
but
out
of
the
dark
waters
of
our
own
perturbed
minds
that
we
may
make
to
ourselves
the
most
of
your
significance
they
teach
he
tells
us
elsewhere
something
significant
to
all
of
us
and
each
man
has
a
whole
hemisphere
of
them
if
he
will
but
look
up
to
counsel
and
befriend
him
there
is
a
passage
in
an
address
given
many
years
ago
by
professor
huxley
to
the
south
london
working
men
college
which
struck
me
very
much
at
the
time
and
which
puts
this
in
language
more
forcible
than
any
which
i
could
use
suppose
he
said
it
were
perfectly
certain
that
the
life
and
fortune
of
every
one
of
us
would
one
day
or
other
depend
upon
his
winning
or
losing
a
game
of
chess
do
you
think
that
we
should
all
consider
it
to
be
a
primary
duty
to
learn
at
least
the
names
and
the
moves
of
the
pieces
do
you
not
think
that
we
should
look
with
a
disapprobation
amounting
to
scorn
upon
the
father
who
allowed
his
son
or
the
state
which
allowed
its
members
to
grow
up
without
knowing
a
pawn
from
a
knight
yet
it
is
a
very
plain
and
elementary
truth
that
the
life
the
fortune
and
the
happiness
of
every
one
of
us
and
more
or
less
of
those
who
are
connected
with
us
do
depend
upon
our
knowing
something
of
the
rules
of
a
game
infinitely
more
difficult
and
complicated
than
chess
it
is
a
game
which
has
been
played
for
untold
ages
every
man
and
woman
of
us
being
one
of
the
two
players
in
a
game
of
his
or
her
own
the
chessboard
is
the
world
the
pieces
are
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
the
rules
of
the
game
are
what
we
call
the
laws
of
nature
the
player
on
the
other
side
is
hidden
from
us
we
know
that
his
play
is
always
fair
just
and
patient
but
also
we
know
to
our
cost
that
he
never
overlooks
a
mistake
or
makes
the
smallest
allowance
for
ignorance
to
the
man
who
plays
well
the
highest
stakes
are
paid
with
that
sort
of
overflowing
generosity
which
with
the
strong
shows
delight
in
strength
and
one
who
plays
ill
is
checkmated
without
haste
but
without
remorse
i
have
elsewhere
endeavored
to
show
the
purifying
and
ennobling
influence
of
science
upon
religion
how
it
has
assisted
if
indeed
it
may
not
claim
the
main
share
in
sweeping
away
the
dark
superstitions
the
degrading
belief
in
sorcery
and
witchcraft
and
the
cruel
however
intolerance
which
embittered
the
christian
world
almost
from
the
very
days
of
the
apostles
themselves
in
this
she
has
surely
performed
no
mean
service
to
religion
itself
as
canon
fremantle
has
well
and
justly
said
men
of
science
and
not
the
clergy
only
are
ministers
of
religion
again
the
national
necessity
for
scientific
education
is
imperative
we
are
apt
to
forget
how
much
we
owe
to
science
because
so
many
of
its
wonderful
gifts
have
become
familiar
parts
of
our
everyday
life
that
their
very
value
makes
us
forget
their
origin
at
the
recent
celebration
of
the
sexcentenary
of
peterhouse
college
near
the
close
of
a
long
dinner
sir
frederick
bramwell
was
called
on
some
time
after
midnight
to
return
thanks
for
applied
science
he
excused
himself
from
making
a
long
speech
on
the
ground
that
though
the
subject
was
almost
inexhaustible
the
only
illustration
which
struck
him
as
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
was
the
application
of
the
domestic
lucifer
to
the
bedroom
candle
one
can
not
but
feel
how
unfortunate
was
the
saying
of
the
poet
that
the
telegraph
bears
nothing
on
its
beam
the
report
of
the
royal
commission
on
technical
instruction
which
has
recently
been
issued
teems
with
illustrations
of
the
advantages
afforded
by
technical
instruction
at
the
same
time
technical
training
ought
not
to
begin
too
soon
for
as
bain
truly
observes
in
a
right
view
of
scientific
education
the
first
principles
and
leading
examples
with
select
details
of
all
the
great
sciences
are
the
proper
basis
of
the
complete
and
exhaustive
study
of
any
single
science
indeed
in
the
words
of
sir
john
herschel
it
can
hardly
be
pressed
forcibly
enough
on
the
attention
of
the
student
of
nature
that
there
is
scarcely
any
natural
phenomenon
which
can
be
fully
and
completely
explained
in
all
its
circumstances
without
a
union
of
several
perhaps
of
all
the
sciences
the
most
important
secrets
of
nature
are
often
hidden
away
in
unexpected
places
many
valuable
substances
have
been
discovered
in
the
refuse
of
manufactories
and
it
was
a
happy
thought
of
glauber
to
examine
what
everybody
else
threw
away
there
is
perhaps
no
nation
the
future
happiness
and
prosperity
of
which
depend
more
on
science
than
our
own
our
population
is
over
and
is
rapidly
increasing
even
at
present
it
is
far
larger
than
our
acreage
can
support
few
people
whose
business
does
not
lie
in
the
study
of
statistics
realize
that
we
have
to
pay
foreign
countries
no
less
than
a
year
for
food
this
of
course
we
purchase
mainly
by
manufactured
articles
we
hear
now
a
great
deal
about
depression
of
trade
and
foreign
especially
american
competition
which
let
me
observe
will
be
much
keener
a
few
years
hence
when
the
united
states
have
paid
off
their
debt
and
consequently
reduced
taxation
but
let
us
look
forward
a
hundred
years
no
long
time
in
the
history
of
a
nation
our
coal
supplies
will
then
be
greatly
diminished
the
population
of
great
britain
doubles
at
the
present
rate
of
increase
in
about
fifty
years
so
that
we
should
if
the
present
rate
continues
require
to
import
over
a
year
in
food
how
then
is
this
to
be
paid
for
we
have
before
us
as
usual
three
courses
the
natural
rate
of
increase
may
be
stopped
which
means
suffering
and
outrage
or
the
population
may
increase
only
to
vegetate
in
misery
and
destitution
or
lastly
by
the
development
of
scientific
training
and
appliances
they
may
probably
be
maintained
in
happiness
and
comfort
we
have
in
fact
to
make
our
choice
between
science
and
suffering
it
is
only
by
wisely
utilizing
the
gifts
of
science
that
we
have
any
hope
of
maintaining
our
population
in
plenty
and
comfort
science
however
will
do
this
for
us
if
we
will
only
let
her
she
may
be
no
fairy
godmother
indeed
but
she
will
richly
endow
those
who
love
her
that
discoveries
innumerable
marvellous
and
fruitful
await
the
successful
explorers
of
nature
no
one
can
doubt
what
would
one
not
give
for
a
science
primer
of
the
next
century
for
to
paraphrase
a
saying
even
the
boy
at
the
plough
will
then
know
more
of
science
than
the
wisest
of
our
philosophers
do
now
boyle
entitled
one
of
his
essays
of
man
great
ignorance
of
the
uses
of
natural
things
or
that
there
is
no
one
thing
in
nature
whereof
the
uses
to
human
life
are
yet
thoroughly
understood
a
saying
which
is
still
as
true
now
as
when
it
was
written
and
lest
i
should
be
supposed
to
be
taking
too
sanguine
a
view
let
me
give
the
authority
of
sir
john
herschel
who
says
since
it
can
not
but
be
that
innumerable
and
most
important
uses
remain
to
be
discovered
among
the
materials
and
objects
already
known
to
us
as
well
as
among
those
which
the
progress
of
science
must
hereafter
disclose
we
may
hence
conceive
a
expectation
not
only
of
constant
increase
in
the
physical
resources
of
mankind
and
the
consequent
improvement
of
their
condition
but
of
continual
accession
to
our
power
of
penetrating
into
the
arcana
of
nature
and
becoming
acquainted
with
her
highest
laws
nor
is
it
merely
in
a
material
point
of
view
that
science
would
thus
benefit
the
nation
she
will
raise
and
strengthen
the
national
as
surely
as
the
individual
character
the
great
gift
which
minerva
offered
to
paris
is
now
freely
tendered
to
all
for
we
may
apply
to
the
nation
as
well
as
to
the

these

power
of
herself
would
come
uncalled
for
but
to
live
by
law
acting
the
law
we
live
by
without
fear
in
the
vain
and
foolish
exultation
of
the
heart
said
john
quincy
adams
at
the
close
of
his
final
lecture
on
resigning
his
chair
at
boston
which
the
brighter
prospects
of
life
will
sometimes
excite
the
pensive
portress
of
science
shall
call
you
to
the
sober
pleasures
of
her
holy
cell
in
the
mortification
of
disappointment
her
soothing
voice
shall
whisper
serenity
and
peace
in
social
converse
with
the
mighty
dead
of
ancient
days
you
will
never
smart
under
the
galling
sense
of
dependence
upon
the
mighty
living
of
the
present
age
and
in
your
struggles
with
the
world
should
a
crisis
ever
occur
when
even
friendship
may
deem
it
prudent
to
desert
you
when
priest
and
levite
shall
come
and
look
on
you
and
pass
by
on
the
other
side
seek
refuge
my
unfailing
friends
and
be
assured
you
shall
find
it
in
the
friendship
of
laelius
and
scipio
in
the
patriotism
of
cicero
demosthenes
and
burke
as
well
as
in
the
precepts
and
example
of
him
whose
law
is
love
and
who
taught
us
to
remember
injuries
only
to
forgive
them
let
me
in
conclusion
quote
the
glowing
description
of
our
debt
to
science
given
by
archdeacon
farrar
in
his
address
at
liverpool
college
testimony
moreover
all
the
more
valuable
considering
the
source
from
which
it
comes
in
this
great
commercial
city
he
said
where
you
are
surrounded
by
the
triumphs
of
science
and
of
mechanism
you
whose
river
is
ploughed
by
the
great
steamships
whose
white
wake
has
been
called
the
fittest
avenue
to
the
palace
front
of
a
mercantile
people
you
know
well
that
in
the
achievements
of
science
there
is
not
only
beauty
and
wonder
but
also
beneficence
and
power
it
is
not
only
that
she
has
revealed
to
us
infinite
space
crowded
with
unnumbered
worlds
infinite
time
peopled
by
unnumbered
existences
infinite
organisms
hitherto
invisible
but
full
of
delicate
and
iridescent
loveliness
but
also
that
she
has
been
as
a
great
archangel
of
mercy
devoting
herself
to
the
service
of
man
she
has
labored
her
votaries
have
labored
not
to
increase
the
power
of
despots
or
to
add
to
the
magnificence
of
courts
but
to
extend
human
happiness
to
economize
human
effort
to
extinguish
human
pain
where
of
old
men
toiled
half
blinded
and
half
naked
in
the
mouth
of
the
glowing
furnace
to
mix
the
iron
she
now
substitutes
the
mechanical
action
of
the
viewless
air
she
has
enlisted
the
sunbeam
in
her
service
to
limn
for
us
with
absolute
fidelity
the
faces
of
the
friends
we
love
she
has
shown
the
poor
miner
how
he
may
work
in
safety
even
amid
the
explosive
of
the
mine
she
hits
by
her
anaesthetics
enabled
the
sufferer
to
be
hushed
and
unconscious
while
the
delicate
hand
of
some
skilled
operator
cuts
a
fragment
from
the
nervous
circle
of
the
unquivering
eye
she
points
not
to
pyramids
built
during
weary
centuries
by
the
sweat
of
miserable
nations
but
to
the
lighthouse
and
the
steamship
to
the
railroad
and
the
telegraph
she
has
restored
eyes
to
the
blind
and
hearing
to
the
deaf
she
has
lengthened
life
she
has
minimized
danger
she
has
controlled
madness
she
has
trampled
on
disease
and
on
all
these
grounds
i
think
that
none
of
our
sons
should
grow
up
wholly
ignorant
of
studies
which
at
once
train
the
reason
and
fire
the
imagination

education
no
pleasure
is
comparable
to
the
standing
upon
the
vantage
ground
of
bacon
divine
philosophy
not
harsh
and
crabbed
as
dull
fools
suppose
but
musical
as
is
apollo
lute
and
a
perpetual
feast
of
nectar
sweets
where
no
crude
surfeit
milton
it
may
seem
rather
surprising
to
include
education
among
the
pleasures
of
life
for
in
too
many
cases
it
is
made
odious
to
the
young
and
is
supposed
to
cease
with
school
while
on
the
contrary
if
it
is
to
be
really
successful
it
must
be
suitable
and
therefore
interesting
to
children
and
must
last
through
life
the
very
process
of
acquiring
knowledge
is
a
privilege
and
a
blessing
it
used
to
be
said
that
there
was
no
royal
road
to
learning
it
would
be
more
true
to
say
that
the
avenues
leading
to
it
are
all
royal
it
is
not
says
jeremy
taylor
the
eye
that
sees
the
beauties
of
heaven
nor
the
ear
that
hears
the
sweetness
of
music
or
the
glad
tidings
of
a
prosperous
accident
but
the
soul
that
perceives
all
the
relishes
of
sensual
and
intellectual
perceptions
and
the
more
noble
and
excellent
the
soul
is
the
greater
and
more
savory
are
its
perceptions
and
if
a
child
behold
the
rich
ermine
or
the
diamonds
of
a
starry
night
or
the
order
of
the
world
or
hears
the
discourses
of
an
apostle
because
he
makes
no
reflex
act
on
himself
and
sees
not
what
he
sees
he
can
have
but
the
pleasure
of
a
fool
or
the
deliciousness
of
a
mule
herein
lies
the
importance
of
education
i
say
education
rather
than
instruction
because
it
is
far
more
important
to
cultivate
the
mind
than
to
store
the
memory
studies
are
a
means
and
not
an
end
to
spend
too
much
time
in
studies
is
sloth
to
use
them
too
much
for
ornament
is
affectation
to
make
judgment
wholly
by
their
rules
is
the
humor
of
a
scholar
they
perfect
nature
and
are
perfected
by
experience
crafty
men
contemn
studies
simple
men
admire
them
and
wise
men
use
them
moreover
though
as
mill
says
in
the
comparatively
early
state
of
human
development
in
which
we
now
live
a
person
can
not
indeed
feel
that
entireness
of
sympathy
with
all
others
which
would
make
any
real
discordance
in
the
general
direction
of
their
conduct
in
life
impossible
yet
education
might
surely
do
more
to
root
in
us
the
feeling
of
unity
with
our
at
any
rate
if
we
do
not
study
in
this
spirit
all
our
learning
will
but
leave
us
as
weak
and
sad
as
faust
i
now
alas
philosophy
medicine
and
jurisprudence
too
and
to
my
cost
theology
with
ardent
labor
studied
through
and
here
i
stand
with
all
my
lore
poor
fool
no
wiser
than
before
our
studies
should
be
neither
a
couch
on
which
to
rest
nor
a
cloister
in
which
to
promenade
alone
nor
a
tower
from
which
to
look
down
on
others
nor
a
fortress
whence
we
may
resist
them
nor
a
workshop
for
gain
and
merchandise
but
a
rich
armory
and
treasury
for
the
glory
of
the
creator
and
the
ennoblement
of
life
for
in
the
noble
words
of
epictetus
you
will
do
the
greatest
service
to
the
state
if
you
shall
raise
not
the
roofs
of
the
houses
but
the
souls
of
the
citizens
for
it
is
better
that
great
souls
should
dwell
in
small
houses
rather
than
for
mean
slaves
to
lurk
in
great
houses
it
is
then
of
great
importance
to
consider
whether
our
present
system
of
education
is
the
one
best
calculated
to
fulfil
these
great
objects
does
it
really
give
that
love
of
learning
which
is
better
than
learning
itself
does
all
the
study
of
the
classics
to
which
our
sons
devote
so
many
years
give
any
just
appreciation
of
them
or
do
they
not
on
leaving
college
too
often
feel
with
byron
then
farewell
horace
whom
i
hated
so
too
much
concentration
on
any
one
subject
is
a
great
mistake
especially
in
early
life
nature
herself
indicates
the
true
system
if
we
would
but
listen
to
her
our
instincts
are
good
guides
though
not
infallible
and
children
will
profit
little
by
lessons
which
do
not
interest
them
in
cheerfulness
says
pliny
is
the
success
of
our
studies
studia
hilaritate
proveniunt
and
we
may
with
advantage
take
a
lesson
from
theognis
who
in
his
ode
on
the
marriage
of
cadmus
and
harmonia
makes
the
muses
sing
what
is
good
and
fair
shall
ever
be
our
care
thus
the
burden
of
it
rang
that
shall
never
be
our
care
which
is
neither
good
nor
fair
such
were
the
words
your
lips
immortal
sang
there
are
some
who
seem
to
think
that
our
educational
system
is
as
good
as
possible
and
that
the
only
remaining
points
of
importance
are
the
number
of
schools
and
scholars
the
question
of
fees
the
relation
of
voluntary
and
board
schools
etc
no
doubt
says
symonds
in
his
in
italy
and
there
are
many
who
think
that
when
we
not
only
advocate
education
but
discuss
the
best
system
we
are
simply
beating
the
air
that
our
population
is
as
happy
and
cultivated
as
can
be
and
that
no
substantial
advance
is
really
possible
galton
however
has
expressed
the
opinion
and
most
of
those
who
have
written
on
the
social
condition
of
athens
seem
to
agree
with
him
that
the
population
of
athens
taken
as
a
whole
was
as
superior
to
us
as
we
are
to
australian
savages
that
there
is
indeed
some
truth
in
this
probably
no
student
of
greek
history
will
deny
why
then
should
this
be
so
i
can
not
but
think
that
our
system
of
education
is
partly
responsible
manual
and
science
teaching
need
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
instruction
in
other
subjects
though
so
much
has
been
said
about
the
importance
of
science
and
the
value
of
technical
instruction
or
of
as
i
should
prefer
to
call
it
it
is
unfortunately
true
that
in
our
system
of
education
from
the
highest
schools
downward
both
of
them
are
sadly
neglected
and
the
study
of
language
reigns
supreme
this
is
no
new
complaint
ascham
in
long
ago
lamented
it
milton
in
his
letter
to
samuel
hartlib
complained
that
our
children
are
forced
to
stick
unreasonably
in
these
grammatick
flats
and
shallows
and
observes
that
though
a
linguist
should
pride
himself
to
have
all
the
tongues
babel
cleft
the
world
into
yet
if
he
have
not
studied
the
solid
things
in
them
as
well
as
the
words
and
lexicons
he
were
nothing
so
much
to
be
esteemed
a
learned
man
as
any
yeoman
or
tradesman
competently
wise
in
his
mother
dialect
only
and
locke
said
that
schools
fit
us
for
the
university
rather
than
for
the
world
commission
after
commission
committee
after
committee
have
reiterated
the
same
complaint
how
then
do
we
stand
now
i
see
it
indeed
constantly
stated
that
even
if
the
improvement
is
not
so
rapid
as
could
be
desired
still
we
are
making
considerable
progress
but
is
this
so
i
fear
not
i
fear
that
our
present
system
does
not
really
train
the
mind
or
cultivate
the
power
of
observation
or
even
give
the
amount
of
information
which
we
may
reasonably
expect
from
the
time
devoted
to
it
sir
has
expressed
the
opinion
that
a
boy
or
girl
of
fourteen
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
read
aloud
clearly
and
agreeably
to
write
a
large
distinct
round
hand
and
to
know
the
ordinary
rules
of
arithmetic
especially
compound
addition
a
by
no
means
universal
accomplishment
to
speak
and
write
french
with
ease
and
correctness
and
have
some
slight
acquaintance
with
french
literature
to
translate
aperturam
from
an
ordinary
french
or
german
book
to
have
a
thoroughly
good
elementary
knowledge
of
geography
under
which
are
comprehended
some
notions
of
astronomy
enough
to
excite
his
curiosity
a
knowledge
of
the
very
broadest
facts
of
geology
and
history
enough
to
make
him
understand
in
a
clear
but
perfectly
general
way
how
the
larger
features
of
the
world
he
lives
in
physical
and
political
came
to
be
like
what
they
are
to
have
been
trained
from
earliest
infancy
to
use
his
powers
of
observation
on
plants
or
animals
or
rocks
or
other
natural
objects
and
to
have
gathered
a
general
acquaintance
with
what
is
most
supremely
good
in
that
portion
of
the
more
important
english
classics
which
is
suitable
to
his
time
of
life
to
have
some
rudimentary
acquaintance
with
drawing
and
music
to
effect
this
no
doubt
industry
must
be
our
oracle
and
reason
our
apollo
as
sir
browne
says
but
surely
it
is
no
unreasonable
estimate
yet
how
far
do
we
fall
short
of
it
general
culture
is
often
deprecated
because
it
is
said
that
smatterings
are
useless
but
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
having
a
smattering
of
or
being
well
grounded
in
a
subject
it
is
the
latter
which
we
advocate
to
try
to
know
as
lord
brougham
well
said
everything
of
something
and
something
of
everything
it
can
hardly
says
sir
john
herschel
be
pressed
forcibly
enough
on
the
attention
of
the
student
of
nature
that
there
is
scarcely
any
natural
phenomenon
which
can
be
fully
and
completely
explained
in
all
its
circumstances
without
a
union
of
several
perhaps
of
all
the
sciences
the
present
system
in
most
of
our
public
schools
and
colleges
sacrifices
everything
else
to
classics
and
arithmetic
they
are
most
important
subjects
but
ought
not
to
exclude
science
and
modern
languages
moreover
after
all
our
sons
leave
college
unable
to
speak
either
latin
or
greek
and
too
often
absolutely
without
any
interest
in
classical
history
or
literature
but
the
boy
who
has
been
educated
without
any
training
in
science
has
grave
reason
to
complain
of
knowledge
to
one
entrance
quite
shut
out
by
concentrating
the
attention
indeed
so
much
on
one
or
two
subjects
we
defeat
our
own
object
and
produce
a
feeling
of
distaste
where
we
wish
to
create
an
interest
our
great
mistake
in
education
is
as
it
seems
to
me
the
worship
of
the
confusion
of
instruction
and
education
we
strain
the
memory
instead
of
cultivating
the
mind
the
children
in
our
elementary
schools
are
wearied
by
the
mechanical
act
of
writing
and
the
interminable
intricacies
of
spelling
they
are
oppressed
by
columns
of
dates
by
lists
of
kings
and
places
which
convey
no
definite
idea
to
their
minds
and
have
no
near
relation
to
their
daily
wants
and
occupations
while
in
our
public
schools
the
same
unfortunate
results
are
produced
by
the
weary
monotony
of
latin
and
greek
grammar
we
ought
to
follow
exactly
the
opposite
course
with
children
to
give
them
a
wholesome
variety
of
mental
food
and
endeavor
to
cultivate
their
tastes
rather
than
to
fill
their
minds
with
dry
facts
the
important
thing
is
not
so
much
that
every
child
should
be
taught
as
that
every
child
should
be
given
the
wish
to
learn
what
does
it
matter
if
the
pupil
know
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
a
boy
who
leaves
school
knowing
much
but
hating
his
lessons
will
soon
have
forgotten
almost
all
he
ever
learned
while
another
who
had
acquired
a
thirst
for
knowledge
even
if
he
had
learned
little
would
soon
teach
himself
more
than
the
first
ever
knew
children
are
by
nature
eager
for
information
they
are
always
putting
questions
this
ought
to
be
encouraged
in
fact
we
may
to
a
great
extent
trust
to
their
instincts
and
in
that
case
they
will
do
much
to
educate
themselves
too
often
however
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
is
placed
before
them
in
a
form
so
irksome
and
fatiguing
that
all
desire
for
information
is
choked
or
even
crushed
out
so
that
our
schools
in
fact
become
places
for
the
discouragement
of
learning
and
thus
produce
the
very
opposite
effect
from
that
at
which
we
aim
in
short
children
should
be
trained
to
observe
and
to
think
for
in
that
way
there
would
be
opened
out
to
them
a
source
of
the
purest
enjoyment
for
leisure
hours
and
the
wisest
judgment
in
the
work
of
life
another
point
in
which
i
venture
to
think
that
our
system
of
education
might
be
amended
is
that
it
tends
at
present
to
give
the
impression
that
everything
is
known
busby
is
said
to
have
kept
his
hat
on
in
the
presence
of
king
charles
that
the
boys
might
see
what
a
great
man
he
was
i
doubt
however
whether
the
boys
were
deceived
by
the
hat
and
am
very
skeptical
about
theory
of
education
master
john
of
basingstoke
who
was
archdeacon
of
leicester
in
learned
greek
during
a
visit
to
athens
from
constantina
daughter
of
the
archbishop
of
athens
and
used
to
say
afterwards
that
though
he
had
studied
well
and
diligently
at
the
university
of
paris
yet
he
learned
more
from
an
athenian
maiden
of
twenty
we
can
not
all
study
so
pleasantly
as
this
but
the
main
fault
i
find
with
busby
system
is
that
it
keeps
out
of
sight
the
great
fact
of
human
ignorance
boys
are
given
the
impression
that
the
masters
know
everything
if
on
the
contrary
the
great
lesson
impressed
on
them
was
that
what
we
know
is
as
nothing
to
what
we
do
not
know
that
the
great
ocean
of
truth
lies
all
undiscovered
before
us
surely
this
would
prove
a
great
stimulus
and
many
would
be
nobly
anxious
to
enlarge
the
boundaries
of
human
knowledge
and
extend
the
intellectual
kingdom
of
man
philosophy
says
aristotle
begins
in
wonder
for
iris
is
the
child
of
thaumas
education
ought
not
to
cease
when
we
leave
school
but
if
well
begun
there
will
continue
through
life
moreover
whatever
our
occupation
or
profession
in
life
may
be
it
is
most
desirable
to
create
for
ourselves
some
other
special
interest
in
the
choice
of
a
subject
every
one
should
consult
his
own
instincts
and
interests
i
will
not
attempt
to
suggest
whether
it
is
better
to
pursue
art
or
science
whether
we
should
study
the
motes
in
the
sunbeam
or
the
heavenly
bodies
themselves
whatever
may
be
the
subject
of
our
choice
we
shall
find
enough
and
more
than
enough
to
repay
the
devotion
of
a
lifetime
life
no
doubt
is
paved
with
enjoyments
but
we
must
all
expect
times
of
anxiety
of
suffering
and
of
sorrow
and
when
these
come
it
is
an
inestimable
comfort
to
have
some
deep
interest
which
will
at
any
rate
to
some
extent
enable
us
to
escape
from
ourselves
a
cultivated
mind
says
mill
i
do
not
mean
that
of
a
philosopher
but
any
mind
to
which
the
fountains
of
knowledge
have
been
opened
and
which
has
been
taught
in
any
tolerable
degree
to
exercise
its
faculties
will
find
sources
of
inexhaustible
interest
in
all
that
surrounds
it
in
the
objects
of
nature
the
achievements
of
art
the
imaginations
of
poetry
the
incidents
of
history
the
ways
of
mankind
past
and
present
and
their
prospects
in
the
future
it
is
possible
indeed
to
become
indifferent
to
all
this
and
that
too
without
having
exhausted
a
thousandth
part
of
it
but
only
when
one
has
had
from
the
beginning
no
moral
or
human
interest
in
these
things
and
has
sought
in
them
only
the
gratification
of
curiosity
i
have
been
subjected
to
some
banter
for
having
said
that
i
looked
forward
to
a
time
when
our
artisans
and
mechanics
would
be
great
readers
but
it
is
surely
not
unreasonable
to
regard
our
social
condition
as
susceptible
of
great
improvement
the
spread
of
schools
the
cheapness
of
books
the
establishment
of
free
libraries
will
it
may
be
hoped
exercise
a
civilizing
and
ennobling
influence
they
will
even
i
believe
do
much
to
diminish
poverty
and
suffering
so
much
of
which
is
due
to
ignorance
and
to
the
want
of
interest
and
brightness
in
uneducated
life
so
far
as
our
elementary
schools
are
concerned
there
is
no
doubt
much
difficulty
in
apportioning
the
national
grant
without
unduly
stimulating
mere
mechanical
instruction
but
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
the
subject
of
religious
or
moral
training
or
the
system
of
apportioning
the
grant
if
we
succeed
in
giving
the
love
of
learning
the
learning
itself
is
sure
to
follow
we
should
therefore
endeavor
to
educate
our
children
so
that
every
country
walk
may
be
a
pleasure
that
the
discoveries
of
science
may
be
a
living
interest
that
our
national
history
and
poetry
may
be
sources
of
legitimate
pride
and
rational
enjoyment
in
short
our
schools
if
they
are
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
if
they
are
to
fulfil
their
high
function
must
be
something
more
than
mere
places
of
dry
study
they
must
train
the
children
educated
in
them
so
that
they
may
be
able
to
appreciate
and
enjoy
those
intellectual
gifts
which
might
be
and
ought
to
be
a
source
of
interest
and
of
happiness
alike
to
the
high
and
to
the
low
to
the
rich
and
to
the
poor
a
wise
system
of
education
will
at
least
teach
us
how
little
man
yet
knows
how
much
he
has
still
to
learn
it
will
enable
us
to
realize
that
those
who
complain
of
the
tiresome
monotony
of
life
have
only
themselves
to
blame
and
that
knowledge
is
pleasure
as
well
as
power
it
will
lead
us
all
to
try
with
milton
to
behold
the
bright
countenance
of
truth
in
the
quiet
and
still
air
of
study
and
to
feel
with
bacon
that
no
pleasure
is
comparable
is
the
standing
upon
the
vantage
ground
of
truth
we
should
then
indeed
realize
in
part
for
as
yet
we
can
not
do
so
fully
the
sacred
trusts
of
health
strength
and
time
and
how
thankful
we
ought
to
be

i

in

the

so
kindly
received
that
i
am
running
a
risk
in
attempting
to
add
to
it
in
the
preface
however
to
the
first
part
i
have
expressed
the
hope
that
the
thoughts
and
quotations
in
which
i
have
found
most
comfort
and
delight
might
be
of
use
to
others
also
in
this
my
most
sanguine
hopes
have
been
more
than
realized
not
only
has
the
book
passed
through
thirteen
editions
in
less
than
two
years
but
the
many
letters
which
i
have
received
have
been
most
gratifying
two
criticisms
have
been
repeated
by
several
of
those
who
have
done
me
the
honor
of
noticing
my
previous
volume
it
has
been
said
in
the
first
place
that
my
life
has
been
exceptionally
bright
and
full
and
that
i
can
not
therefore
judge
for
others
nor
do
i
attempt
to
do
so
i
do
not
forget
i
hope
i
am
not
ungrateful
for
all
that
has
been
bestowed
on
me
but
if
i
have
been
greatly
favored
ought
i
not
to
be
on
that
very
account
especially
qualified
to
write
on
such
a
theme
moreover
i
have
had
who
has
not
my
own
sorrows

some
have
complained
that
there
is
too
much

too
little

i
take
to
be
in

a
great
compliment
i

not

as
i
have
been
assured
by
many
my

proved
a
comfort
and
have
been
able

i
ambition
if
fame
be
the
last
infirmity
of
noble
minds
ambition
is
often
the
first
though
when
properly
directed
it
may
be
no
feeble
aid
to
virtue
had
not
my
youthful
mind
says
cicero
from
many
precepts
from
many
writings
drunk
in
this
truth
that
glory
and
virtue
ought
to
be
the
darling
nay
the
only
wish
in
life
that
to
attain
these
the
torments
of
the
flesh
with
the
perils
of
death
and
exile
are
to
be
despised
never
had
i
exposed
my
person
in
so
many
encounters
and
to
these
daily
conflicts
with
the
worst
of
men
for
your
deliverance
but
on
this
head
books
are
full
the
voice
of
the
wise
is
full
the
examples
of
antiquity
are
full
and
all
these
the
night
of
barbarism
had
still
enveloped
had
it
not
been
enlightened
by
the
sun
of
science
the
poet
tells
us
that
the
many
fail
the
one
succeeds
but
this
is
scarcely
true
all
succeed
who
deserve
though
not
perhaps
as
they
hoped
an
honorable
defeat
is
better
than
a
mean
victory
and
no
one
is
really
the
worse
for
being
beaten
unless
he
loses
heart
though
we
may
not
be
able
to
attain
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
aspire
i
know
says
morris
how
far
high
failure
overleaps
the
bound
of
low
successes
and
bacon
assures
us
that
if
a
man
look
sharp
and
attentively
he
shall
see
fortune
for
though
she
is
blind
she
is
not
invisible
to
give
ourselves
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success
we
must
realize
what
we
hope
to
achieve
and
then
make
the
most
of
our
opportunities
of
these
the
use
of
time
is
one
of
the
most
important
what
have
we
to
do
with
time
asks
oliver
wendell
holmes
but
to
fill
it
up
with
labor
at
the
battle
of
montebello
said
napoleon
i
ordered
kellermann
to
attack
with
horse
and
with
these
he
separated
the
hungarian
grenadiers
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
austrian
cavalry
this
cavalry
was
half
a
league
off
and
required
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
arrive
on
the
field
of
action
and
i
have
observed
that
it
is
always
these
quarters
of
an
hour
that
decide
the
fate
of
a
battle
including
we
may
add
the
battle
of
life
nor
must
we
spare
ourselves
in
other
ways
for
he
who
thinks
in
strife
to
earn
a
deathless
fame
must
do
nor
ever
care
for
life
in
the
excitement
of
the
struggle
moreover
he
will
suffer
comparatively
little
from
wounds
and
blows
which
would
otherwise
cause
intense
suffering
it
is
well
to
weigh
scrupulously
the
object
in
view
to
run
as
little
risk
as
may
be
to
count
the
cost
with
care
but
when
the
mind
is
once
made
up
there
must
be
no
looking
back
you
must
spare
yourself
no
labor
nor
shrink
from
danger
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
or
his
deserts
are
small
that
dares
not
put
it
to
the
touch
to
gain
or
lose
it
all
glory
says
renan
is
after
all
the
thing
which
has
the
best
chance
of
not
being
altogether
vanity
but
what
is
glory
marcus
aurelius
observes
that
a
spider
is
proud
when
it
has
caught
a
fly
a
man
when
he
has
caught
a
hare
another
when
he
has
taken
a
little
fish
in
a
net
another
when
he
has
taken
wild
boars
another
when
he
has
taken
bears
and
another
when
he
has
taken
sarmatians
but
this
if
from
one
point
of
view
it
shows
the
vanity
of
fame
also
encourages
us
with
the
evidence
that
every
one
may
succeed
if
his
objects
are
but
reasonable
alexander
may
be
taken
as
almost
a
type
of
ambition
in
its
usual
form
though
carried
to
an
extreme
his
desire
was
to
conquer
not
to
inherit
or
to
rule
when
news
was
brought
that
his
father
philip
had
taken
some
town
or
won
some
battle
instead
of
appearing
delighted
with
it
he
used
to
say
to
his
companions
my
father
will
go
on
conquering
till
there
be
nothing
extraordinary
left
for
you
and
me
to
do
he
is
said
even
to
have
been
mortified
at
the
number
of
the
stars
considering
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
conquer
one
world
such
ambition
is
justly
foredoomed
to
disappointment
the
remarks
of
philosophers
on
the
vanity
of
ambition
refer
generally
to
that
unworthy
form
of
which
alexander
may
be
taken
as
the
type
the
idea
of
not
only
without
any
reference
to
the
happiness
but
even
regardless
of
the
sufferings
of
others
a
continual
and
restless
search
after
fortune
says
bacon
takes
up
too
much
of
their
time
who
have
nobler
things
to
observe
indeed
he
elsewhere
extends
this
and
adds
no
man
private
fortune
can
be
an
end
any
way
worthy
of
his
existence
goethe
well
observes
that
man
exists
for
culture
not
for
what
he
can
accomplish
but
for
what
can
be
accomplished
in
him
as
regards
fame
we
must
not
confuse
name
and
essence
to
be
remembered
is
not
necessarily
to
be
famous
there
is
infamy
as
well
as
fame
and
unhappily
almost
as
many
are
remembered
for
the
one
as
for
the
other
and
not
a
few
for
the
mixture
of
both
who
would
not
rather
be
forgotten
than
recollected
as
ahab
or
jezebel
nero
or
commodus
messalina
or
heliogabalus
king
john
or
richard
to
be
nameless
in
worthy
deeds
exceeds
an
infamous
history
the
canaanitish
woman
lives
more
happily
without
a
name
than
herodias
with
one
and
who
would
not
rather
have
been
the
good
thief
than
pilate
kings
and
generals
are

napoleon
was
a

genius
though
no

but
what
came
of
all

they

away
like

the

result
of

the

a
surer
and
more
glorious
title
to

is

who
are

for
some
act

the

are
the
glories
of

in
some
cases
where
men
have
been
called
after
places
the
men
are

while
the
places
are
forgotten
when
we
speak
of

or

remembers
the

only

it
is
true
that
we
have
but
meagre
biographies
of
shakespeare
or
of
plato
yet
how
much
we
know
about
them
statesmen
and
generals
enjoy
great
celebrity
during
their
lives
the
newspapers
chronicle
every
word
and
movement
but
the
fame
of
the
philosopher
and
poet
is
more
enduring
wordsworth
deprecates
monuments
to
poets
with
some
exceptions
on
this
very
account
the
case
of
statesmen
he
says
is
different
it
is
right
to
commemorate
them
because
they
might
otherwise
be
forgotten
but
poets
live
in
their
books
forever
the
real
conquerors
of
the
world
indeed
are
not
the
generals
but
the
thinkers
not
genghis
khan
and
akbar
rameses
or
alexander
but
confucius
and
buddha
aristotle
plato
and
christ
the
rulers
and
kings
who
reigned
over
our
ancestors
have
for
the
most
part
long
since
sunk
into
oblivion
they
are
forgotten
for
want
of
some
sacred
bard
to
give
them
life
or
are
remembered
like
suddhodana
and
pilate
from
their
association
with
higher
spirits
such
men
lives
can
not
be
compressed
into
any
biography
they
lived
not
merely
in
their
own
generation
but
for
all
time
when
we
speak
of
the
elizabethan
period
we
think
of
shakespeare
and
bacon
raleigh
and
spenser
the
ministers
and
secretaries
of
state
with
one
or
two
exceptions
we
scarcely
remember
and
bacon
himself
is
recollected
less
as
the
judge
than
as
the
philosopher
moreover
to
what
do
generals
and
statesmen
owe
their
fame
they
were
celebrated
for
their
deeds
but
to
the
poet
and
the
historian
they
owe
their
fame
and
to
the
poet
and
historian
we
owe
their
glorious
memories
and
the
example
of
their
virtues

and

over
obstacles
which

have
seemed

may
be
a

wealth
ambition
often
takes
the
form
of
a
love
of
money
there
are
many
who
have
never
attempted
art
or
music
poetry
or
science
but
most
people
do
something
for
a
livelihood
and
consequently
an
increase
of
income
is
not
only
acceptable
in
itself
but
gives
a
pleasant
feeling
of
success
doubt
is
often
expressed
whether
wealth
is
any
advantage
i
do
not
myself
believe
that
those
who
are
born
as
the
saying
is
with
a
silver
spoon
in
their
mouth
are
necessarily
any
the
happier
for
it
no
doubt
wealth
entails
almost
more
labor
than
poverty
and
certainly
more
anxiety
still
it
must
i
think
be
confessed
that
the
possession
of
an
income
whatever
it
may
be
which
increases
somewhat
as
the
years
roll
on
does
add
to
the
comfort
of
life
unquestionably
the
possession
of
wealth
is
by
no
means
unattended
by
drawbacks
money
and
the
love
of
money
often
go
together
the
poor
man
as
emerson
says
is
the
man
who
wishes
to
be
rich
and
the
more
a
man
has
the
more
he
often
longs
to
be
richer
just
as
drinking
often
does
but
increase
thirst
so
in
many
cases
the
craving
for
riches
does
grow
with
wealth
this
is
of
course
especially
the
case
when
money
is
sought
for
its
own
sake
moreover
it
is
often
easier
to
make
money
than
to
keep
or
to
enjoy
it
keeping
it
is
dull
and
anxious
drudgery
the
dread
of
loss
may
hang
like
a
dark
cloud
over
life
apicius

he

of
his
patrimony
but
had
still
crowns
left
committed
suicide
as
seneca
tells
us
for
fear
he
should
die
of
hunger
wealth
is
certainly
no
sinecure
moreover
the
value
of
money
depends
partly
on
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
partly
on
the
manner
in
which
it
is
acquired
acquire
money
thy
friends
say
that
we
also
may
have
some
if
i
can
acquire
money
and
also
keep
myself
modest
and
faithful
and
magnanimous
point
out
the
way
and
i
will
acquire
it
but
if
you
ask
me
to
love
the
things
which
are
good
and
my
own
in
order
that
you
may
gain
things
that
are
not
good
see
how
unfair
and
unwise
you
are
for
which
would
you
rather
have
money
or
a
faithful
and
modest
friend
what
hinders
a
man
who
has
clearly
comprehended
these
things
from
living
with
a
light
heart
and
bearing
easily
the
reins
quietly
expecting
everything
which
can
happen
and
enduring
that
which
has
already
happened
would
you
have
me
to
bear

come
and
you
will
know
what
poverty
is

it

he
is
by
no
means
the
only
man
who
has
suffered
from
too
much
gold
the
real
truth
i
take
to
be
that
wealth
is
not
necessarily
an
advantage
but
that
whether
it
is
so
or
not
depends
on
the
use
we
make
of
it
the
same
however
might
be
said
of
most
other
opportunities
and
privileges
knowledge
and
strength
beauty
and
skill
may
all
be
abused
if
we
neglect
or
misuse
them
we
are
worse
off
than
if
we
had
never
had
them
wealth
is
only
a
disadvantage
in
the
hands
of
those
who
do
not
know
how
to
use
it
it
gives
the
command
of
so
many
other
things
leisure
the
power
of
helping
friends
books
works
of
art
opportunities
and
means
of
travel
it
would
however
be
easy
to
exaggerate
the
advantages
of
money
it
is
well
worth
having
and
worth
working
for
but
it
does
not
requite
too
great
a
sacrifice
not
indeed
so
great
as
is
often
offered
up
to
it
a
wise
proverb
tells
us
that
gold
may
be
bought
too
dear
if
wealth
is
to
be
valued
because
it
gives
leisure
clearly
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
sacrifice
leisure
in
the
struggle
for
wealth
money
has
no
doubt
also
a
tendency
to
make
men
poor
in
spirit
but
on
the
other
hand
what
gift
is
there
which
is
without
danger
euripides
said
that
money
finds
friends
for
men
and
has
great
he
said
the
greatest
power
among
mankind
cynically
adding
a
mighty
person
indeed
is
a
rich
man
especially
if
his
heir
be
unknown
bossuet
tells
us
that
he
had
no
attachment
to
riches
still
if
he
had
only
what
was
barely
necessary
he
felt
himself
narrowed
and
would
lose
more
than
half
his
talents
shelley
was
certainly
not
an
avaricious
man
and
yet
i
desire
money
he
said
because
i
think
i
know
the
use
of
it
it
commands
labor
it
gives
leisure
and
to
give
leisure
to
those
who
will
employ
it
in
the
forwarding
of
truth
is
the
noblest
present
an
individual
can
make
to
the
whole
many
will
have
felt
with
pepys
when
he
quaintly
and
piously
says
abroad
with
my
wife
the
first
time
that
ever
i
rode
in
my
own
coach
which
do
make
my
heart
rejoice
and
praise
god
and
pray
him
to
bless
it
to
me
and
continue
it
this
indeed
was
a
somewhat
selfish
satisfaction
yet
the
merchant
need
not
quit
nor
be
ashamed
of
his
profession
bearing
in
mind
only
the
inscription
on
the
church
of
giacomo
de
rialto
at
venice
around
this
temple
let
the
merchant
law
be
just
his
weight
true
and
his
covenants
faithful
if
life
has
been
sacrificed
to
the
rolling
up
of
money
for
its
own
sake
the
very
means
by
which
it
was
acquired
will
prevent
its
being
enjoyed
the
chill
of
poverty
will
have
entered
into
the
very
bones
the
term
miser
was
happily
chosen
for
such
persons
they
are
essentially
miserable

unpublished
therein
and
yet
what
hath
the

sight
of
it
with
his
eyes
we
are
really
richer

we
think

often
hear
of

people
envy
a
great
landlord
and
fancy
how
delightful
it
must
be
to
possess
a
large
estate
but
as
emerson
says
if
you
own
land
the
land
owns
you
moreover
have
we
not
all
in
a
better
sense
have
we
not
all
thousands
of
acres
of
our
own
the
commons
and
roads
and
footpaths
and
the
seashore
our
grand
and
varied
coast
these
are
all
ours
the
has
moreover
two
great
advantages
in
the
first
place
it
is
for
the
most
part
but
little
interfered
with
by
man
and
in
the
second
it
exhibits
most
instructively
the
forces
of
nature
we
are
all
great
landed
proprietors
if
we
only
knew
it
what
we
lack
is
not
land
but
the
power
to
enjoy
it
moreover
this
great
inheritance
has
the
additional
advantage
that
it
entails
no
labor
requires
no
management
the
landlord
has
the
trouble
but
the
landscape
belongs
to
every
one
who
has
eyes
to
see
it
thus
kingsley
called
the
heaths
round
eversley
his
winter
garden
not
because
they
were
his
in

of

but
in
that
higher
sense
in
which
ten
thousand
persons
may
own
the
same
thing

told
that
a
coin
was
struck
in
his
honor
representing
the
philosopher
in
the
act
of
staying
the
hand
of
phoebus
we
scarcely
realize
i
think
how
much
we
owe
to
doctors
our
system
of
medicine
seems
so
natural
and
obvious
that
it
hardly
occurs
to
us
as
somewhat
new
and
exceptional
when
we
are
ill
we
send
for
a
physician
he
prescribes
some
medicine
we
take
it
and
pay
his
fee
but
among
the
lower
races
of
men
pain
and
illness
are
often
attributed
to
the
presence
of
evil
spirits
the
medicine
man
is
a
priest
or
rather
a
sorcerer
more
than
a
true
doctor
and
his
effort
is
to
exorcise
the
evil
spirit
in
other
countries
where
some
advance
has
been
made
a
charm
is
written
on
a
board
washed
off
and
drunk
in
some
cases
the
medicine
is
taken
not
by
the
patient
but
by
the
doctor
such
a
system
however
is
generally
transient
it
is
naturally
discouraged
by
the
profession
and
is
indeed
incompatible
with
a
large
practice
even
as
regards
the
payment
we
find
very
different
systems
the
chinese
pay
their
medical
man
as
long
as
they
are
well
and
stop
his
salary
as
soon
as
they
are
ill
in
ancient
egypt
we
are
told
that
the
patient
feed
the
doctor
for
the
first
few
days
after
which
the
doctor
paid
the
patient
until
he
made
him
well
this
is
a
fascinating
system
but
might
afford
too
much
temptation
to
heroic
remedies
on
the
whole
our
plan
seems
the
best
though
it
does
not
offer
adequate
encouragement
to
discovery
and
research
we
do
not
appreciate
how
much
we
owe
to
the
discoveries
of
such
men
as
hunter
and
jenner
simpson
and
lister
and
yet
in
the
matter
of
health
we
can
generally
do
more
for
ourselves
than
the
greatest
doctors
can
for
us
but
if
all
are
agreed
as
to
the
blessing
of
health
there
are
many
who
will
not
take
the

trouble
or
submit
to
the
slight
sacrifices
necessary
to
maintain
it
many
indeed
deliberately
ruin
their
own
health
and
incur
the
certainty
of
an
early
grave
or
an
old
age
of
suffering
no
doubt
some
inherit
a
constitution
which
renders
health
almost
unattainable
pope
spoke
of
that
long
disease
his
life
many
indeed
may
say
i
suffer
therefore
i
am
but
happily
these
cases
are
exceptional
most
of
us
might
be
well
if
we
would
it
is
very
much
our
own
fault
that
we
are
we
do
those
things
which
we
ought
not
to
do
and
we
leave
undone
those
things
which
we
ought
to
have
done
and
then
we
wonder
there
is
no
health
in
us
we
all
know
that
we
can
make
ourselves
ill
but
few
perhaps
realize
how
much
we
can
do
to
keep
ourselves
well
much
of
our
suffering
is
it
has
been
observed
that
among
the
ancient
egyptians
the
chief
aim
of
life
seemed
to
be
to
be
well
buried
many
however
live
even
now
as
if
this
were
the
principal
object
of
their
existence
like
naaman
we
expect
our
health
to
be
the
subject
of
some
miraculous
interference
and
neglect
the
homely
precautions
by
which
it
might
be
secured
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
whether
the
study
of
health
is
sufficiently
impressed
on
the
minds
of
those
entering
life
not
that
it
is
desirable
to
potter
over
minor
ailments
to
con
over
books
on
illnesses
or
experiment
on
ourselves
with
medicine
far
from
it
the
less
we
fancy
ourselves
ill
or
bother
about
little
bodily
discomforts
the
more
likely
perhaps
we
are
to
preserve
our
health
it
is
however
a
different
matter
to
study
the
general
conditions
of
health
a
proverb
tells
us
that
every
one
is
a
fool
or
a
physician
at
forty
unfortunately
however
many
persons
are
invalids
at
forty
as
well
as
physicians
however
is
no
excuse
for
moroseness
if
we
have
one
disease
we
may
at
least
congratulate
ourselves
that
we
are
escaping
all
the
rest
sydney
smith
ever
ready
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
once
when
borne
down
by
suffering
wrote
to
a
friend
that
he
had
gout
asthma
and
seven
other
maladies
but
was
otherwise
very
well
and
many
of
the
greatest
invalids
have
borne
their
sufferings
with
cheerfulness
and
good
spirits
it
is
said
that
the
celebrated
physiognomist
campanella
could
so
abstract
his
attention
from
any
sufferings
of
his
body
that
he
was
even
able
to
endure
the
rack
without
much
pain
and
whoever
has
the
power
of
concentrating
his
attention
and
controlling
his
will
can
emancipate
himself
from
most
of
the
minor
miseries
of
life
he
may
have
much
cause
for
anxiety
his
body
may
be
the
seat
of
severe
suffering
and
yet
his
mind
will
remain
serene
and
unaffected
he
may
triumph
over
care
and
pain
but
many
have
undergone
much
unnecessary
suffering
and
valuable
lives
have
often
been
lost
through
ignorance
or
carelessness
we
can
not
but
fancy
that
the
lives
of
many
great
men
might
have
been
much
prolonged
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
ordinary
care
if
we
take
musicians
only
what
a
grievous
loss
to
the
world
it
is
that
pergolesi
should
have
died
at
schubert
at
mozart
at
purcell
at
and
mendelssohn
at
in
the
old
greek
myth
the
life
of
meleager
was
indissolubly
connected
by
fate
with
the
existence
of
a
particular
log
of
wood
as
long
as
this
was
kept
safe
by
althaea
his
mother
meleager
bore
a
charmed
life
it
seems
wonderful
that
we
do
not
watch
with
equal
care
over
our
body
on
the
state
of
which
happiness
so
much
depends
the
requisites
of
health
are
plain
enough
regular
habits
daily
exercise
cleanliness
and
moderation
in
all
things
in
eating
as
well
as
in
drinking
would
keep
most
people
well
i
need
not
here
dwell
on
the
evils
of
drinking
but
we
perhaps
scarcely
realize
how
much
of
the
suffering
and
of
life
is
due
to
dyspepsia
for
instance
from
which
so
many
suffer
is
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
their
own
fault
and
arises
from
the
combination
of
too
much
food
with
too
little
exercise
to
lengthen
your
life
says
an
old
proverb
shorten
your
meals
plain
living
and
high
thinking
will
secure
health
for
most
of
us
though
it
matters
perhaps
comparatively
little
what
a
healthy
man
eats
so
long
as
he
does
not
eat
too
much
gladstone
has
told
us
that
the
splendid
health
he
enjoys
is
greatly
due
to
his
having
early
learnt
one
simple
physiological
maxim
and
laid
it
down
as
a
rule
for
himself
always
to
make
bites
at
every
bit
of
meat
go
to
your
banquet
then
but
use
delight
so
as
to
rise
still
with
an
appetite
no
doubt
however
though
the
rule
not
to
eat
or
drink
too
much
is
simple
enough
in
theory
it
is
not
quite
so
easy
in
application
there
have
been
many
esaus
who
sold
their
birthright
of
health
for
a
mess
of
pottage
moreover
it
may
seem
paradoxical
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
in
the
long
run
the
moderate
man
will
derive
more
enjoyment
even
from
eating
and
drinking
than
the
glutton
or
the
drunkard
will
ever
obtain
they
know
not
what
it
is
to
enjoy
the
exquisite
taste
of
common
dry
bread
and
yet
even
if
we
were
to
consider
merely
the
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
eating
and
drinking
the
same
rule
would
hold
good
a
lunch
of
bread
and
cheese
after
a
good
walk
is
more
enjoyable
than
a
lord
mayor
feast
without
wishing
like
apicius
for
the
neck
of
a
stork
so
that
he
might
enjoy
his
dinner
longer
we
must
not
be
ungrateful
for
the
enjoyment
we
derive
from
eating
and
drinking
even
though
they
be
amongst
the
least
aesthetic
of
our
pleasures
they
are
homely
no
doubt
but
they
come
morning
noon
and
night
and
are
not
the
less
real
because
they
have
reference
to
the
body
rather
than
the
soul
we
speak
truly
of
a
healthy
appetite
for
it
is
a
good
test
of
our
bodily
condition
and
indeed
in
some
cases
of
our
mental
state
also
that
there
cometh
no
good
thing
apart
from
toil
to
mortals
is
especially
true
with
reference
to
appetite
to
sit
down
to
a
dinner
however
simple
after
a
walk
with
a
friend
among
the
mountains
or
along
the
shore
is
no
insignificant
pleasure
cheerfulness
and
good
humor
moreover
during
meals
are
not
only
pleasant
in
themselves
but
conduce
greatly
to
health
it
has
been
said
that
hunger
is
the
best
sauce
but
most
would
prefer
some
good
stories
at
a
feast
even
to
a
good
appetite
and
who
would
not
like
to
have
it
said
of
him
as
of
biron
by
rosaline
a
merrier
man
within
the
limit
of
becoming
mirth
i
never
spent
an
hour
talk
withal
in
the
three
great
banquets
of
plato
xenophon
and
plutarch
the
food
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
words
of
the
old
lambeth
adage
what
is
a
merry
man
let
him
do
what
he
can
to
entertain
his
guests
with
wine
and
pleasant
jests
yet
if
his
wife
do
frown
all
merryment
goes
down
what
salt
is
to
food
wit
and
humor
are
to
conversation
and
literature
you
do
not
an
amusing
writer
in
the
has
said
expect
humor
in
thomas
ŕ
kempis
or
hebrew
prophets
but
we
have
solomon
authority
that
there
is
a
time
to
laugh
as
well
as
to
weep
to
read
a
good
comedy
is
to
keep
the
best
company
in
the
world
when
the
best
things
are
said
and
the
most
amusing
things
happen
it
is
not
without
reason
that
every
one
resents
the
imputation
of
being
unable
to
see
a
joke
laughter
appears
to
be
the
special
prerogative
of
man
the
higher
animals
present
us
with
proof
of
evident
if
not
highly
developed
reasoning
power
but
it
is
more
than
doubtful
whether
they
are
capable
of
appreciating
a
joke
wit
moreover
has
solved
many
difficulties
and
decided
many
controversies
ridicule
shall
frequently
prevail
and
cut
the
knot
when
graver
reasons
fail
a
careless
song
says
walpole
with
a
little
nonsense
in
it
now
and
then
does
not
misbecome
a
monarch
but
it
is
difficult
now
to
realize
that
james
should
have
regarded
skill
in
punning
in
his
selections
of
bishops
and
privy
councillors
the
most
wasted
of
all
days
says
chamfort
is
that
on
which
one
has
not
laughed
it
is
moreover
no
small
merit
of
laughter
that
it
is
quite
spontaneous
you
can
not
force
people
to
laugh
you
can
not
give
a
reason
why
they
should
laugh
they
must
laugh
of
themselves
or
not
at
all
if
we
think
we
must
not
laugh
this
makes
our
temptation
to
laugh
the
greater
humor
is
moreover
contagious
a
witty
man
may
say
as
falstaff
does
of
himself
i
am
not
only
witty
in
myself
but
the
cause
that
wit
is
in
other
men
but
one
may
paraphrase
the
remark
about
port
wine
and
say
that
some
jokes
may
be
better
than
others
but
anything
which
makes
one
laugh
is
good
after
all
says
dryden
it
is
a
good
thing
to
laugh
at
any
rate
and
if
a
straw
can
tickle
a
man
it
is
an
instrument
of
happiness
and
i
may
add
of
health
i
have
been
told
that
in
omitting
any
mention
of
smoking
i
was
overlooking
one
of
the
real
pleasures
of
life
not
being
a
smoker
myself
i
can
not
perhaps
judge
much
must
depend
on
the
individual
temperament
to
some
nervous
natures
it
certainly
appears
to
be
a
great
comfort
but
i
have
my
doubts
whether
smoking
as
a
general
rule
does
add
to
the
pleasures
of
life
it
must
moreover
detract
somewhat
from
the
sensitiveness
of
taste
and
of
smell
those
who
live
in
cities
may
almost
lay
it
down
as
a
rule
that
no
time
spent
out
of
doors
is
ever
wasted
fresh
air
is
a
cordial
of
incredible
virtue
old
families
are
in
all
senses
county
families
not
town
families
and
those
who
prefer
homer
and
plato
and
shakespeare
to
hares
and
partridges
and
foxes
must
beware
that
they
are
not
tempted
to
neglect
this
great
requisite
of
our
nature
most
englishmen
however
love
open
air
and
it
is
probably
true
that
most
of
us
enjoy
a
game
at
cricket
or
golf
more
than
looking
at
any
of
the
old
masters
the
love
of
sport
is
engraven
in
the
english
character
as
was
said
of
william
rufus
he
loves
the
tall
deer
as
he
had
been
their
father
an
oriental
traveler
is
said
to
have
watched
a
game
of
cricket
and
been
much
astonished
at
hearing
that
many
of
those
playing
were
rich
men
he
asked
why
they
did
not
pay
some
poor
people
to
do
it
for
them
wordsworth
made
it
a
rule
to
go
out
every
day
and
he
used
to
say
that
as
he
never
consulted
the
weather
he
never
had
to
consult
the
physicians
it
always
seems
to
be
raining
harder
than
it
really
is
when
you
look
at
the
weather
through
the
window
even
in
winter
though
the
landscape
often
seems
cheerless
and
bare
enough
when
you
look
at
it
from
the
fireside
still
it
is
far
better
to
go
out
even
if
you
have
to
brave
the
storm
when
you
are
once
out
of
doors
the
touch
of
earth
and
the
breath
of
the
fresh
air
gives
you
fresh
life
and
energy
men
like
trees
live
in
great
part
on
air
after
a
gallop
over
the
downs
a
row
on
the
river
a
sea
voyage
a
walk
by
the
seashore
or
in
the
woods
the
blue
above
the
music
in
the
air
the
flowers
upon
the
ground
one
feels
as
if
one
could
say
with
henry
je
me
porte
comme
le
ponte
neuf
the
roman
proverb
that
a
child
should
be
taught
nothing
which
he
can
not
learn
standing
up
went
no
doubt
into
an
extreme
but
surely
we
fall
into
another
when
we
act
as
if
games
were
the
only
thing
which
boys
could
learn
upon
their
feet
the
love
of
games
among
boys
is
certainly
a
healthy
instinct
and
though
carried
too
far
in
some
of
our
great
schools
there
can
be
no
question
that
cricket
and
football
boating
and
hockey
bathing
and
birdnesting
are
not
only
the
greatest
pleasures
but
the
best
medicines
for
boys
we
can
not
always
secure
sleep
when
important
decisions
have
to
be
taken
the
natural
anxiety
to
come
to
a
right
decision
will
often
keep
us
awake
nothing
however
is
more
conducive
to
healthy
sleep
than
plenty
of
open
air
then
indeed
we
can
enjoy
the
fresh
life
of
the
early
morning
the
breezy
call
of
morn
at
morn
the
blackcock
trims
his
jetty
wing
is
morning
tempts
the
linnet
blithest
lay
all
nature
children
feel
the
matin
spring
of
life
reviving
with
reviving
day
epictetus
described
himself
as
a
spirit
bearing
about
a
corpse
that
seems
to
me
an
ungrateful
description
surely
we
ought
to
cherish
the
body
even
if
it
be
but
a
frail
and
humble
companion
do
we
not
own
to
the
eye
our
enjoyment
of
the
beauties
of
this
world
and
the
glories
of
the
heavens
to
the
ear
the
voices
of
friends
and
all
the
delights
of
music
are
not
the
hands
most
faithful
and
invaluable
instruments
ever
ready
in
case
of
need
ever
willing
to
do
our
bidding
and
even
the
feet
bear
us
without
a
murmur
along
the
roughest
and
stoniest
paths
of
life
with
reasonable
care
then
most
of
us
may
hope
to
enjoy
good
health
and
yet
what
a
marvellous
and
complex
organization
we
have
we
are
indeed
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
it
is
strange
that
a
harp
of
a
thousand
strings
should
keep
in
tune
so
long
when
we
consider
the
marvellous
complexity
of
our
bodily
organization
it
seems
a
miracle
that
we
should
live
at
all
much
more
that
the
innumerable
organs
and
processes
should
continue
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
with
so
much
regularity
and
so
little
friction
that
we
are
sometimes
scarcely
conscious
of
having
a
body
at
all
and
yet
in
that
body
we
have
more
than
bones
of
complex
and
varied
forms
any
irregularity
in
or
injury
to
which
would
of
course
grievously
interfere
with
our
movements
we
have
over
muscles
each
nourished
by
almost
innumerable
blood
vessels
and
regulated
by
nerves
one
of
our
muscles
the
heart
beats
over
times
in
a
year
and
if
it
once
stops
all
is
over
in
the
skin
are
wonderfully
varied
and
complex
organs
for
instance
over
perspiration
glands
which
regulate
the
temperature
and
communicate
with
the
surface
by
ducts
which
have
a
total
length
of
some
ten
miles
think
of
the
miles
of
arteries
and
veins
of
capillaries
and
nerves
of
the
blood
with
the
millions
of
millions
of
blood
corpuscles
each
a
microcosm
in
itself

of
the
organs
of

the
eye
with
its
cornea
and
lens
vitreous
humor
aqueous
humor
and

culminating
in
the

thicker
than
a

of
paper
and

consisting
of
nine
distinct
layers
the
innermost
composed
of
rods
and

supposed
to
be
the
immediate
recipients
of
the
undulations
of
light
and
so
numerous
that
in
each
eye
the
cones
are
estimated
at
over
the
rods
at
over
above
all
and
most
wonderful
of
all
the
brain
itself
meinert
has
calculated
that
the
gray
matter
of
the
convolutions
alone
contains
no
less
than
cells
each
cell
consists
of
several
thousand
visible
atoms
and
each
atom
again
of
many
millions
of
molecules
and
yet
with
reasonable
care
we
can
most
of
us
keep
this
wonderful
organization
in
health
so
that
it
will
work
without
causing
us
pain
or
even
discomfort
for
many
years
and
we
may
hope
that
even

may
lay

chapter
iv
love
love
is
the
light
and
sunshine
of
life
we
are
so
constituted
that
we
can
not
fully
enjoy
ourselves
or
anything
else
unless
some
one
we
love
enjoys
it
with
us
even
if
we
are
alone
we
store
up
our
enjoyment
in
hope
of
sharing
it
hereafter
with
those
we
love
love
lasts
through
life
and
adapts
itself
to
every
age
and
circumstance
in
childhood
for
father
and
mother
in
manhood
for
wife
in
age
for
children
and
throughout
for
brothers
and
sisters
relations
and
friends
the
strength
of
friendship
is
indeed
proverbial
and
in
some
cases
as
in
that
of
david
and
jonathan
is
described
as
surpassing
the
love
of
women
but
i
need
not
now
refer
to
it
having
spoken
already
of
what
we
owe
to
friends
the
goodness
of
providence
to
man
has
been
often
compared
to
that
of
fathers
and
mothers
for
their
children
just
as
a
mother
with
sweet
pious
face
yearns
toward
her
little
children
from
her
seat
gives
one
a
kiss
another
an
embrace
takes
this
upon
her
knees
that
on
her
feet
and
while
from
actions
looks
complaints
pretences
she
learns
their
feelings
and
their
various
will
to
this
a
look
to
that
a
word
dispenses
and
whether
stern
or
smiling
loves
them
still
so
providence
for
us
high
infinite
makes
our
necessities
its
watchful
task
hearkens
to
all
our
prayers
helps
all
our
wants
and
if
it
denies
what
seems
our
right
either
denies
because
have
us
ask
or
seems
but
to
deny
or
in
denying
grants
sir
walter
scott
well
says
and
if
there
be
on
earth
a
tear
from
passion
dross
refined
and
clear
is
that
which
pious
fathers
shed
upon
a
duteous
daughter
head
epaminondas
is
said
to
have
given
as
his
main
reason
for
rejoicing
at
the
victory
of
leuctra
that
it
would
give
so
much
pleasure
to
his
father
and
mother
nor
must
the
love
of
animals
be
altogether
omitted
it
is
impossible
not
to
sympathize
with
the
savage
when
he
believes
in
their
immortality
and
thinks
that
after
death
admitted
to
that
equal
sky
his
faithful
dog
shall
bear
him
company
in
the
the
great
indian
epic
when
the
family
of
pandavas
the
heroes
at
length
reach
the
gates
of
heaven
they
are
welcomed
themselves
but
are
told
that
their
dog
can
not
come
in
having
pleaded
in
vain
they
turn
to
depart
as
they
say
they
can
never
leave
their
faithful
companion
then
at
the
last
moment
the
angel
at
the
door
relents
and
their
dog
is
allowed
to
enter
with
them
we
may
hope
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
learn
never
to
blend
our
pleasures
or
our
pride
with
sorrow
of
the
meanest
thing
that
feels
but
at
the
present
moment
i
am
speaking
rather
of
the
love
which
leads
to
marriage
such
love
is
the
music
of
life
nay
there
is
music
in
the
beauty
and
the
silver
note
of
love
far
sweeter
than
the
sound
of
any
instrument
the
symposium
of
plato
contains
an
interesting
and
amusing
disquisition
on
love
love
phaedrus
is
made
to
say
will
make
men
dare
to
die
for
their
beloved
love
alone
and
women
as
well
as
men
of
this
alcestis
the
daughter
of
pelias
is
a
monument
to
all
hellas
for
she
was
willing
to
lay
down
her
life
on
behalf
of
her
husband
when
no
one
else
would
although
he
had
a
father
and
mother
but
the
tenderness
of
her
love
so
far
exceeded
theirs
that
she
made
them
seem
to
be
strangers
in
blood
to
their
own
son
and
in
name
only
related
to
him
and
so
noble
did
this
action
of
hers
appear
to
the
gods
as
well
as
to
men
that
among
the
many
who
have
done
virtuously
she
is
one
of
the
very
few
to
whom
they
have
granted
the
privilege
of
returning
to
earth
in
admiration
of
her
virtue
such
exceeding
honor
is
paid
by
them
to
the
devotion
and
virtue
of
love
agathon
is
even
more
eloquent
love
fills
men
with
affection
and
takes
away
their
disaffection
making
them
meet
together
at
such
banquets
as
these
in
sacrifices
feasts
dances

amazement

charms
the
souls
of
gods
and
men
no
doubt
even
so
there
are
two
loves
one
the
daughter
of
uranus
who
has
no
mother
and
is
the
elder
and
wiser
goddess
and
the
other
the
daughter
of
zeus
and
dione
who
is
popular
and
common
but
let
us
not
examine
too
closely
charity
tells
us
even
of
guinevere
that
while
she
lived
she
was
a
good
lover
and
therefore
she
had
a
good
end
the
origin
of
love
has
exercised
philosophers
almost
as
much
as
the
origin
of
evil
the
symposium
continues
with
a
speech
which
plato
attributes
in
joke
to
aristophanes
and
of
which
jowett
observes
that
nothing
in
aristophanes
is
more
truly
aristophanic
the
original
human
nature
he
says
was
not
like
the
present
the
primeval
man
was
round
his
back
and
sides
forming
a
circle
and
he
had
four
hands
and
four
feet
one
head
with
two
faces
looking
opposite
ways
set
on
a
round
neck
and
precisely
alike
he
could
walk
upright
as
men
now
do
backward
or
forward
as
he
pleased
and
he
could
also
roll
over
and
over
at
a
great
rate
whirling
round
on
his
four
hands
and
four
feet
eight
in
all
like
tumblers
going
over
and
over
with
their
legs
in
the
air
this
was
when
he
wanted
to
run
fast
terrible
was
their
might
and
strength
and
the
thoughts
of
their
hearts
great
and
they
made
an
attack
upon
the
gods
of
them
is
told
the
tale
of
otys
and
ephialtes
who
as
homer
says
dared
to
scale
heaven
and
would
have
laid
hands
upon
the
gods
doubt
reigned
in
the
celestial
councils
should
they
kill
them
and
annihilate
the
race
with
thunderbolts
as
they
had
done
the
giants
then
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
sacrifices
and
worship
which
men
offered
to
them
but
on
the
other
hand
the
gods
could
not
suffer
their
insolence
to
be
unrestrained
at
last
after
a
good
deal
of
reflection
zeus
discovered
a
way
he
said
methinks
i
have
a
plan
which
will
humble
their
pride
and
mend
their
manners
they
shall
continue
to
exist
but
i
will
cut
them
in
two
which
will
have
a
double
advantage
for
it
will
halve
their
strength
and
we
shall
have
twice
as
many
sacrifices
they
shall
walk
upright
on
two
legs
and
if
they
continue
insolent
and
will
not
be
quiet
i
will
split
them
again
and
they
shall
hop
on
a
single
leg
he
spoke
and
cut
men
in
two
as
you
might
split
an
egg
with
a
after
the
division
the
two
parts
of
man
each
desiring
his
other
half
came
together
so
ancient
is
the
desire
of
one
another
which
is
implanted
in
us
reuniting
our
original
nature
making
one
of
two
and
healing
the
state
of
man
each
of
us
when
separated
is
but
the
indenture
of
a
man
having
one
side
only
like
a
and
he
is
always
looking
for
his
other
half
and
when
one
of
them
finds
his
other
half
the
pair
are
lost
in
amazement
of
love
and
friendship
and
intimacy
and
one
will
not
be
out
of
the
other
sight
as
i
may
say
even
for
a
minute
they
will
pass
their
whole
lives
together
yet
they
could
not
explain
what
they
desire
of
one
another
for
the
intense
yearning
which
each
of
them
has
toward
the
other
does
not
appear
to
be
the
desire
of
lover
intercourse
but
of
something
else
which
the
soul
of
either
evidently
desires
and
can
not
tell
and
of
which
she
has
only
a
dark
and
doubtful
presentiment
however
this
may
be
there
is
such
instinctive
insight
in
the
human
heart
that
we
often
form
our
opinion
almost
instantaneously
and
such
impressions
seldom
change
i
might
even
say
they
are
seldom
wrong
love
at
first
sight
sounds
like
an
imprudence
and
yet
is
almost
a
revelation
it
seems
as
if
we
were
but
renewing
the
relations
of
a
previous
existence
but
to
see
her
were
to
love
her
love
but
her
and
love
for
ever
yet
though
experience
seldom
falsifies
such
a
feeling
happily
the
reverse
does
not
hold
good
the
deepest
affection
is
often
of
slow
growth
many
a
warm
love
has
been
won
by
faithful
devotion
montaigne
indeed
declares
that
few
have
married
for
love
without
repenting
it
johnson
also
maintained
that
marriages
would
generally
be
happier
if
they
were
arranged
by
the
lord
chancellor
but
i
do
not
think
either
montaigne
or
johnson
were
good
judges
as
lancelot
said
to
the
unfortunate
maid
of
astolat
i
love
not
to
be
constrained
to
love
for
love
must
arise
of
the
heart
and
not
by
constraint
love
defies
distance
and
the
elements
sestos
and
abydos
are
divided
by
the
sea
but
love
joined
them
by
an
arrow
from
his
bow
love
can
be
happy
anywhere
byron
wished
o
that
the
desert
were
my
with
one
fair
spirit
for
my
minister
that
i
might
all
forget
the
human
race
and
hating
no
one
love
but
only
her
and
many
will
doubtless
have
felt
o
love
what
hours
were
thine
and
mine
in
lands
of
palm
and
southern
pine
in
lands
of
palm
of
orange
blossom
of
olive
aloe
and
maize
and
vine
what
is
true
of
space
holds
good
equally
of
time
in
peace
love
tunes
the
shepherd
reed
in
war
he
mounts
the
warrior
steed
in
halls
in
gay
attire
is
seen
in
hamlets
dances
on
the
green
love
rules
the
court
the
camp
the
grove
and
men
below
and
saints
above
for
love
is
heaven
and
heaven
is
love
even
when
as
among
some
eastern
races
religion
and
philosophy
have
combined
to
depress
love
truth
reasserts
itself
in
popular
sayings
as
for
instance
in
the
turkish
proverb
all
women
are
perfection
especially
she
who
loves
you
a
french
lady
having
once
quoted
to
the
polish
proverb
a
woman
draws
more
with
a
hair
of
her
head
than
a
pair
of
oxen
well
harnessed
he
answered
with
a
smile
the
hair
is
unnecessary
woman
is
powerful
as
fate
but
we
like
to
think
of
love
rather
as
the
angel
of
happiness
than
as
a
ruling
force
of
the
joy
of
home
when
hearts
are
of
each
other
sure
it
is
the
secret
sympathy
the
silver
link
the
silken
tie
which
heart
to
heart
and
mind
to
mind
in
body
and
in
soul
can
bind
what
bacon
says
of
a
friend
is
even
truer
of
a
wife
there
is
no
man
that
imparteth
his
joys
to
his
friend
but
he
joyeth
the
more
and
no
man
that
imparteth
his
griefs
to
his
friend
but
he
grieveth
the
less
let
some
one
we
love
come
near
us
and
at
once
it
seems
that
something
new
or
strange
has
passed
upon
the
flowers
the
trees
the
ground
some
slight
but
unintelligible
change
on
everything
around
we
might
i
think
apply
to
love
what
homer
says
of
fate
her
feet
are
tender
for
she
sets
her
steps
not
on
the
ground
but
on
the
heads
of
men
love
and
reason
divide
the
life
of
man
we
must
give
to
each
its
due
if
it
is
impossible
to
attain
to
virtue
by
the
aid
of
reason
without
love
neither
can
we
do
so
by
means
of
love
alone
without
reason
love
said
melanippides
sowing
in
the
heart
of
man
the
sweet
harvest
of
desire
mixes
the
sweetest
and
most
beautiful
things
together
no
one
indeed
could
complain
now
with
phaedrus
in
plato
symposium
that
love
has
had
no
worshippers
among
the
poets
on
the
contrary
love
has
brought
them
many
of
their
sweetest
inspirations
none
perhaps
nobler
or
more
beautiful
than
milton
description
of
paradise
with
thee
conversing
i
forget
all
time
all
seasons
and
their
change
all
please
alike
sweet
is
the
breath
of
morn
her
rising
sweet
with
charm
of
earliest
birds
pleasant
the
sun
when
first
on
this
delightful
land
he
spreads
his
orient
beams
on
herb
tree
fruit
and
flower
glistering
with
dew
fragrant
the
fertile
earth
after
soft
showers
and
sweet
the
coming
on
of
grateful
evening
mild
then
silent
night
with
this
her
solemn
bird
and
this
fair
moon
and
these
the
gems
of
heaven
her
starry
train
but
neither
breath
of
morn
when
she
ascends
with
charm
of
earliest
birds
nor
rising
sun
on
this
delightful
land
nor
herb
fruit
flower
glistering
with
dew
nor
fragrance
after
showers
nor
grateful
evening
mild
nor
silent
night
with
this
her
solemn
bird
nor
walk
by
moon
or
glittering
starlight
without
thee
is
sweet
moreover
no
one
need
despair
of
an
ideal
marriage
we
unfortunately
differ
so
much
in
our
tastes
love
does
so
much
to
create
love
that
even
the
humblest
may
hope
for
the
happiest
marriage
if
only
he
deserves
it
and
shakespeare
speaks
as
he
does
so
often
for
thousands
when
he
says
she
is
mine
own
and
i
as
rich
in
having
such
a
jewel
as
twenty
seas
if
all
their
sands
were
pearls
the
water
nectar
and
the
rocks
pure
gold
true
love
indeed
will
not
be
unreasonable
or
exacting
tell
me
not
sweet
i
am
unkind
that
from
the
nursery
of
thy
chaste
breast
and
quiet
mind
to
war
and
arms
i
fly
true
a
new
mistress
now
i
chase
the
first
foe
in
the
field
and
with
a
stronger
faith
embrace
a
sword
a
horse
a
shield
yet
this
inconstancy
is
such
as
you
too
shall
adore
i
could
not
love
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honor
more
and
yet
alas
how
light
a
cause
may
move
dissension
between
hearts
that
love
hearts
that
the
world
in
vain
had
tried
and
sorrow
but
more
closely
tied
that
stood
the
storm
when
waves
were
rough
yet
in
a
sunny
hour
fall
off
like
ships
that
have
gone
down
at
sea
when
heaven
was
all
tranquillity
for
love
is
brittle
do
not
risk
even
any
little
jar
it
may
be
the
little
rift
within
the
lute
that
by
and
by
will
make
the
music
mute
and
ever
widening
slowly
silence
all
love
is
delicate
love
is
hurt
with
jar
and
fret
and
you
might
as
well
expect
a
violin
to
remain
in
tune
if
roughly
used
as
love
to
survive
if
chilled
or
driven
into
itself
but
what
a
pleasure
to
keep
it
alive
by
little
nameless
unremembered
acts
of
kindness
and
of
love
she
whom
you
loved
and
chose
says
bondi
is
now
your
bride
the
gift
of
heaven
and
to
your
trust
consigned
honor
her
still
though
not
with
passion
blind
and
in
her
virtue
though
you
watch
confide
be
to
her
youth
a
comfort
guardian
guide
in
whose
experience
she
may
safety
find
and
whether
sweet
or
bitter
be
assigned
the
joy
with
her
as
well
as
pain
divide
yield
not
too
much
if
reason
disapprove
nor
too
much
force
the
partner
of
your
life
should
neither
victim
be
nor
tyrant
prove
thus
shall
that
rein
which
often

art
the
most
ancient
works
of
art
which
we
possess
are
representations
of
animals
rude
indeed
but
often
strikingly
characteristic
engraved
on
or
carved
in
or
bone
and
found
in
english
french
and
german
caves
with
stone
and
other
rude
implements
and
the
remains
of
mammalia
belonging
apparently
to
the
close
of
the
glacial
epoch
not
only
of
the
deer
bear
and
other
animals
now
inhabiting
temperate
europe
but
of
some
such
as
the
reindeer
the
musk
sheep
and
the
mammoth
which
have
either
retreated
north
or
become
altogether
extinct
we
may
i
think
venture
to
hope
that
other
designs
may
hereafter
be
found
which
will
give
us
additional
information
as
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
our
ancestors
in
those
remote
ages
next
to
these
in
point
of
antiquity
come
the
sculptures
and
paintings
on
assyrian
and
egyptian
tombs
temples
and
palaces
these
ancient
scenes
considered
as
works
of
art
have
no
doubt
many
faults
and
yet
how
graphically
they
tell
their
story
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
king
is
not
as
a
rule
bigger
than
his
soldiers
but
in
these
he
is
always
so
represented
we
must
however
remember
that
in
ancient
warfare
the
greater
part
of
the
fighting
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
done
by
the
chiefs
in
this
respect
the
homeric
poems
resemble
the
assyrian
and
egyptian
representations
at
any
rate
we
see
at
a
glance
which
is
the
king
which
are
officers
which
side
is
victorious
the
struggles
and
sufferings
of
the
wounded
the
flight
of
the
enemy
the
city
of
refuge
so
that
he
who
runs
may
read
while
in
modern
the
story
is
much
less
clear
and
indeed
the
untrained
eye
sees
for
some
time
little
but
scarlet
and
smoke
these
works
assuredly
possess
a
grandeur
and
dignity
of
their
own
even
though
they
have
not
the
beauty
of
later
art
in
greece
art
reached
a
perfection
which
has
never
been
excelled
and
it
was
more
appreciated
than
perhaps
it
has
ever
been
since
at
the
time
when
demetrius
attacked
the
city
of
rhodes
protogenes
was
painting
a
picture
of
ialysus
this
says
pliny
hindered
king
demetrius
from
taking
rhodes
out
of
fear
lest
he
should
burn
the
picture
and
not
being
able
to
fire
the
town
on
any
other
side
he
was
pleased
rather
to
spare
the
painting
than
to
take
the
victory
which
was
already
in
his
hands
protogenes
at
that
time
had
his
in
a
garden
out
of
the
town
and
very
near
the
camp
of
the
enemies
where
he
was
daily
finishing
those
pieces
which
he
had
already
begun
the
noise
of
soldiers
not
being
capable
of
interrupting
his
studies
but
demetrius
causing
him
to
be
brought
into
his
presence
and
asking
him
what
made
him
so
bold
as
to
work
in
the
midst
of
enemies
he
answered
the
king
he
understood
the
war
which
he
made
was
against
the
rhodians
and
not
against
the
arts
with
the
decay
of
greece
art
sank
too
until
it
was
revived
in
the
thirteenth
century
by
cimabue
since
whose
time
its
progress
has
been
triumphal
art
is
unquestionably
one
of
the
purest
and
highest
elements
in
human
happiness
it
trains
the
mind
through
the
eye
and
the
eye
through
the
mind
as
the
sun
colors
flowers
so
does
art
color
life
in
true
art
says
ruskin
the
hand
the
head
and
the
heart
of
man
go
together
but
art
is
no
recreation
it
can
not
be
learned
at
spare
moments
nor
pursued
when
we
have
nothing
better
to
do
it
is
not
only
in
the
east
that
great
works
really
due
to
study
and
labor
have
been
attributed
to
magic
study
and
labor
can
not
make
every
man
an
artist
but
no
one
can
succeed
in
art
without
them
in
art
two
and
two
do
not
make
four
and
no
number
of
little
things
will
make
a
great
one
it
has
been
said
and
on
high
authority
that
the
end
of
art
is
to
please
but
this
is
a
very
imperfect
definition
it
might
as
well
be
said
that
a
library
is
only
intended
for
pleasure
and
ornament
art
has
the
advantage
of
nature
in
so
far
as
it
introduces
a
human
element
which
is
in
some
respects
superior
even
to
nature
if
says
plato
you
take
a
man
as
he
is
made
by
nature
and
compare
him
with
another
who
is
the
effect
of
art
the
work
of
nature
will
always
appear
the
less
beautitiful
because
art
is
more
accurate
than
nature
bacon
also
in
advancement
of
speaks
of
the
world
being
inferior
to
the
soul
by
reason
whereof
there
is
agreeable
to
the
spirit
of
man
a
more
ample
greatness
a
more
exact
goodness
and
a
more
absolute
variety
than
can
be
found
in
the
nature
of
things
the
poets
tell
us
that
prometheus
having
made
a
beautiful
statue
of
minerva
the
goddess
was
so
delighted
that
she
offered
to
bring
down
anything
from
heaven
which
could
add
to
its
perfection
prometheus
on
this
prudently
asked
her
to
take
him
there
so
that
he
might
choose
for
himself
this
minerva
did
and
prometheus
finding
that
in
heaven
all
things
were
animated
by
fire
brought
back
a
spark
with
which
he
gave
life
to
his
work
in
fact
imitation
is
the
means
and
not
the
end
of
art
the
story
of
zeuxis
and
parrhasius
is
a
pretty
tale
but
to
deceive
birds
or
even
man
himself
is
but
a
trifling
matter
compared
with
the
higher
functions
of
art
to
imitate
the
says
young
is
not
imitating
homer
but
as
sir
reynolds
adds
the
more
the
artist
studies
nature
the
nearer
he
approaches
to
the
true
and
perfect
idea
of
art
following
these
rules
and
using
these
precautions
when
you
have
clearly
and
distinctly
learned
in
what
good
coloring
consists
you
can
not
do
better
than
have
recourse
to
nature
herself
who
is
always
at
hand
and
in
comparison
of
whose
true
splendor
the
best
colored
pictures
are
but
faint
and
feeble
art
indeed
must
create
as
well
as
copy
as
victor
cousin
well
says
the
ideal
without
the
real
lacks
life
but
the
real
without
the
ideal
lacks
pure
beauty
both
need
to
unite
to
join
hands
and
enter
into
alliance
in
this
way
the
best
work
may
be
achieved
thus
beauty
is
an
absolute
idea
and
not
a
mere
copy
of
imperfect
nature
the
grouping
of
the
picture
is
of
course
of
the
utmost
importance
sir
joshua
reynolds
gives
two
remarkable
cases
to
show
how
much
any
given
figure
in
a
picture
is
affected
by
its
surroundings
tintoret
in
one
of
his
pictures
has
taken
the
samson
of
michael
angelo
put
an
eagle
under
him
placed
thunder
and
lightning
in
his
right
hand
instead
of
the
jawbone
of
an
ass
and
thus
turned
him
into
a
jupiter
the
second
instance
is
even
more
striking
titian
has
copied
the
figure
in
the
vault
of
the
sistine
chapel
which
represents
the
deity
dividing
light
from
darkness
and
has
introduced
it
into
his
picture
of
the
battle
of
cadore
to
represent
a
general
falling
from
his
horse
we
must
remember
that
so
far
as
the
eye
is
concerned
the
object
of
the
artist
is
to
train
not
to
deceive
and
that
his
higher
function
has
reference
rather
to
the
mind
than
to
the
eye
no
doubt
to
gild
refined
gold
to
paint
the
lily
to
throw
a
perfume
on
the
violet
to
smooth
the
ice
or
add
another
hue
unto
the
rainbow
or
with
to
seek
the
beauteous
eye
of
heaven
to
garnish
is
wasteful
and
ridiculous
excess
but
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
flowers
are
not
all
arrayed
like
the
lily
and
there
is
room
for
selection
as
well
as
representation
the
true
the
good
and
the
beautiful
says
cousin
are
but
forms
of
the
infinite
what
then
do
we
really
love
in
truth
beauty
and
virtue
we
love
the
infinite
himself
the
love
of
the
infinite
substance
is
hidden
under
the
love
of
its
forms
it
is
so
truly
the
infinite
which
charms
in
the
true
the
good
and
the
beautiful
that
its
manifestations
alone
do
not
suffice
the
artist
is
dissatisfied
at
the
sight
even
of
his
greatest
works
he
aspires
still
higher
it
is
indeed
sometimes
objected
that
landscape
painting
is
not
true
to
nature
but
we
must
ask
what
is
truth
is
the
object
to
produce
the
same
impression
on
the
mind
as
that
created
by
the
scene
itself
if
so
let
any
one
try
to
draw
from
memory
a
group
of
mountains
and
he
will
probably
find
that
in
the
impression
produced
on
his
mind
the
mountains
are
loftier
and
steeper
the
valleys
deeper
and
narrower
than
in
the
actual
reality
a
drawing
then
which
was
literally
exact
would
not
be
true
in
the
sense
of
conveying
the
same
impression
as
nature
herself
in
fact
art
says
goethe
is
called
art
simply
because
it
is
not
nature
it
is
not
sufficient
for
the
artist
to
choose
beautiful
scenery
and
delineate
it
with
accuracy
he
must
not
be
a
mere
copyist
something
higher
and
more
subtle
is
required
he
must
create
or
at
any
rate
interpret
as
well
as
copy
turner
was
never
satisfied
merely
to
reach
to
even
the
most
glorious
scenery
he
moved
and
even
suppressed
mountains
a
certain
nobleman
we
are
told
was
very
anxious
to
see
the
model
from
whom
guido
painted
his
lovely
female
faces
guido
placed
his
a
big
coarse
man
in
an
attitude
and
then
drew
a
beautiful
magdalen
my
dear
count
he
said
the
beautiful
and
pure
idea
must
be
in
the
mind
and
then
it
is
no
matter
what
the
model
is
guido
reni
who
painted
michael
for
the
church
of
the
capuchins
at
rome
wished
that
he
had
the
wings
of
an
angel
to
have
ascended
unto
paradise
and
there
to
have
beheld
the
forms
of
those
beautiful
spirits
from
which
i
might
have
copied
my
archangel
but
not
being
able
to
mount
so
high
it
was
in
vain
for
me
to
seek
for
his
resemblance
here
below
so
that
i
was
forced
to
look
into
mine
own
mind
and
into
that
idea
of
beauty
which
i
have
formed
in
my
own
imagination
science
attempts
as
far
as
the
limited
powers
of
man
permit
to
reproduce
the
actual
facts
in
a
manner
which
however
bald
is
true
in
itself
irrespective
of
time
and
scene
to
do
this
she
must
submit
to
many
limitations
not
altogether
unvexatious
and
not
without
serious
drawbacks
art
on
the
contrary
endeavors
to
convey
the
impression
of
the
original
under
some
especial
aspect
in
some
respects
art
gives
a
clearer
and
more
vivid
idea
of
an
unknown
country
than
any
description
can
convey
in
literature
rock
may
be
rock
but
in
painting
it
must
be
granite
or
slate
and
not
merely
rock
in
general
it
is
remarkable
that
while
artists
have
long
recognized
the
necessity
of
studying
anatomy
and
there
has
been
from
the
commencement
a
professor
of
anatomy
in
the
royal
academy
it
is
only
of
late
years
that
any
knowledge
of
botany
or
geology
has
been
considered
desirable
and
even
now
their
importance
is
by
no
means
generally
recognized
much
has
been
written
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
painting
sculpture
and
architecture
this
if
it
be
not
a
somewhat
unprofitable
inquiry
would
at
any
rate
be
out
of
place
here
architecture
not
only
gives
intense
pleasure
but
even
the
impression
of
something
ethereal
and
superhuman
madame
de
staël
described
it
as
frozen
music
and
a
cathedral
is
a
glorious
specimen
of
thought
in
stone
whose
very
windows
are
transparent
walls
of
gorgeous
hues
caracci
said
that
poets
paint
in
their
words
and
artists
speak
in
their
works
the
latter
have
indeed
one
great
advantage
for
a
glance
at
a
statue
or
a
painting
will
convey
a
more
vivid
idea
than
a
long
and
minute
description
another
advantage
possessed
by
art
is
that
it
is
understood
by
all
civilized
nations
whilst
each
has
a
separate
language
even
from
a
material
point
of
view
art
is
most
important
in
a
recent
address
sir
leighton
has
observed
that
the
study
of
art
is
every
day
becoming
more
important
in
relation
to
certain
sides
of
the
waning
material
prosperity
of
the
country
for
the
industrial
competition
between
this
and
other
countries
a
competition
keen
and
eager
which
means
to
certain
industries
almost
a
race
for
life
runs
in
many
cases
no
longer
exclusively
or
mainly
on
the
lines
of
excellence
of
material
and
solidity
of
workmanship
but
greatly
nowadays
on
the
lines
of
artistic
charm
and
beauty
of
design
the
highest
service
however
that
art
can
accomplish
for
man
is
to
become
at
once
the
voice
of
his
nobler
aspirations
and
the
steady
disciplinarian
of
his
emotions
and
it
is
with
this
mission
rather
than
with
any
aesthetic
perfection
that
we
are
at
present
concerned
science
and
art
are
sisters
or
rather
perhaps
they
are
like
brother
and
sister
the
mission
of
art
is
in
some
respects
like
that
of
woman
it
is
not
hers
so
much
to
do
the
hard
toil
and
moil
of
the
world
as
to
surround
it
with
a
halo
of
beauty
to
convert
work
into
pleasure
in
science
we
naturally
expect
progress
but
in
art
the
case
is
not
so
clear
and
yet
sir
joshua
reynolds
did
not
hesitate
to
express
his
conviction
that
in
the
future
so
much
will
painting
improve
that
the
best
we
can
now
achieve
will
appear
like
the
work
of
children
and
we
may
hope
that
our
power
of
enjoying
it
may
increase
in
an
equal
ratio
wordsworth
says
that
poets
have
to
create
the
taste
for
their
own
works
and
the
same
is
in
some
degree
at
any
rate
true
of
artists
in
one
respect
especially
modern
painters
appear
to
have
made
a
marked
advance
and
one
great
blessing
which
in
fact
we
owe
to
them
is
a
more
vivid
enjoyment
of
scenery
i
have
of
course
no
pretensions
to
speak
with
authority
but
even
in
the
case
of
the
greatest
masters
before
turner
the
landscapes
seem
to
me
singularly
inferior
to
the
figures
sir
joshua
reynolds
tells
us
that
gainsborough
framed
a
kind
of
model
of
a
landscape
on
his
table
composed
of
broken
stones
dried
herbs
and
pieces
of
which
he
magnified
and
improved
into
rocks
trees
and
water
and
sir
joshua
solemnly
discusses
the
wisdom
of
such
a
proceeding
how
far
it
may
be
useful
in
giving
hints
he
says
the
professors
of
landscape
can
best
determine
but
he
does
not
recommend
it
and
is
disposed
to
think
on
the
whole
the
practice
may
be
more
likely
to
do
harm
than
good
in
the
picture
of
ceyx
and
alcyone
by
wilson
of
whom
cunningham
said
that
with
gainsborough
he
laid
the
foundation
of
our
school
of
landscape
the
castle
is
said
to
have
been
painted
from
a
pot
of
porter
and
the
rock
from
a
stilton
cheese
there
is
indeed
another
version
of
the
story
that
the
picture
was
sold
for
a
pot
of
porter
and
a
cheese
which
however
does
not
give
a
higher
idea
of
the
appreciation
of
the
art
of
landscape
at
that
date
until
very
recently
the
general
feeling
with
reference
to
mountain
scenery
has
been
that
expressed
by
tacitus
who
would
leave
asia
or
africa
or
italy
to
go
to
germany
a
shapeless
and
unformed
country
a
harsh
sky
and
melancholy
aspect
unless
indeed
it
was
his
native
land
it
is
amusing
to
read
the
opinion
of
beattie
in
a
special
treatise
on
poetry
and
written
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
that
the
highlands
of
scotland
are
in
general
a
melancholy
country
long
tracts
of
mountainous
country
covered
with
dark
heath
and
often
obscured
by
misty
weather
narrow
valleys
thinly
inhabited
and
bounded
by
precipices
resounding
with
the
fall
of
torrents
a
soil
so
rugged
and
a
climate
so
dreary
as
in
many
parts
to
admit
neither
the
amenities
of
pasturage
nor
the
labors
of
agriculture
the
mournful
dashing
of
waves
along
the
firths
and
lakes
the
portentous
noises
which
every
change
of
the
wind
is
apt
to
raise
in
a
lonely
region
full
of
echoes
and
rocks
and
caverns
the
grotesque
and
ghastly
appearance
of
such
a
landscape
by
the
light
of
the
moon
objects
like
these
diffuse
a
gloom
over
the
fancy
etc
even
goldsmith
regarded
the
scenery
of
the
highlands
as
dismal
and
hideous
johnson
we
know
laid
it
down
as
an
axiom
that
the
noblest
prospect
which
a
scotchman
ever
sees
is
the
high
road
that
leads
him
to
england
a
saying
which
throws
much
doubt
on
his
distinction
that
the
giant
causeway
was
worth
seeing
but
not
worth
going
to
see
madame
de
staël
declared
that
though
she
would
go
leagues
to
meet
a
clever
man
she
would
not
care
to
open
her
window
to
see
the
bay
of
naples
nor
was
the
ancient
absence
of
appreciation
confined
to
scenery
even
burke
speaking
of
stonehenge
says
stonehenge
neither
for
disposition
nor
ornament
has
anything
admirable
ugly
scenery
however
may
in
some
cases
have
an
injurious
effect
on
the
human
system
it
has
been
ingeniously
suggested
that
what
really
drove
don
quixote
out
of
his
mind
was
not
the
study
of
his
books
of
chivalry
so
much
as
the
monotonous
scenery
of
la
mancha
the
love
of
landscape
is
not
indeed
due
to
art
alone
it
has
been
the
happy
combination
of
art
and
science
which
has
trained
us
to
perceive
the
beauty
which
surrounds
us
art
helps
us
to
see
and
hundreds
of
people
can
talk
for
one
who
can
think
but
thousands
can
think
for
one
who
can
see
to
see
clearly
is
poetry
prophecy
and
religion
all
in
one
remembering
always
that
there
are
two
characters
in
which
all
greatness
of
art
consists
first
the
earnest
and
intense
seizing
of
natural
facts
then
the
ordering
those
facts
by
strength
of
human
intellect
so
as
to
make
them
for
all
who
look
upon
them
to
the
utmost
serviceable
memorable
and
beautiful
and
thus
great
art
is
nothing
else
than
the
type
of
strong
and
noble
life
for
as
the
ignoble
person
in
his
dealings
with
all
that
occurs
in
the
world
about
him
first
sees
nothing
clearly
looks
nothing
fairly
in
the
face
and
then
allows
himself
to
be
swept
away
by
the
trampling
torrent
and
unescapable
force
of
the
things
that
he
would
not
foresee
and
could
not
understand
so
the
noble
person
looking
the
facts
of
the
world
full
in
the
face
and
fathoming
them
with
deep
faculty
then
deals
with
them
in
unalarmed
intelligence
and
unhurried
strength
and
becomes
with
his
human
intellect
and
will
no
unconscious
nor
insignificant
agent
in
consummating
their
good
and
restraining
their
evil
may
we
not
also
hope
that
in
this
respect
also
still
further
progress
may
be
made
that
beauties
may
be
revealed
and
pleasures
may
be
in
store
for
those
who
come
after
us
which
we
can
not
appreciate
or
at
least
can
but
faintly
feel
even
now
there
is
scarcely
a
cottage
without
something
more
or
less
successfully
claiming
to
rank
as
art
a
picture
a
photograph
or
a
statuette
and
we
may
fairly
hope
that
much
as
art
even
now
contributes
to
the
happiness
of
life
it
will
do
so
even
more
effectively
in
the
future

tennyson
chapter

poetry
after
the
disastrous
defeat
of
the
athenians
before
syracuse
plutarch
tells
us
that
the
sicilians
spared
those
who
could
repeat
any
of
the
poetry
of
euripides
some
there
were
he
says
who
owed
their
preservation
to
euripides
of
all
the
grecians
his
was
the
muse
with
whom
the
sicilians
were
most
in
love
from
the
strangers
who
landed
in
their
island
they
gleaned
every
small
specimen
or
portion
of
his
works
and
communicated
it
with
pleasure
to
each
other
it
is
said
that
upon
this
occasion
a
number
of
athenians
on
their
return
home
went
to
euripides
and
thanked
him
in
the
most
grateful
manner
for
their
obligations
to
his
pen
some
having
been
enfranchised
for
teaching
their
masters
what
they
remembered
of
his
poems
and
others
having
procured
refreshments
when
they
were
wandering
about
after
the
battle
by
singing
a
few
of
his
verses
nowadays
we
are
none
of
us
likely
to
owe
our
lives
to
poetry
in
this
sense
yet
in
another
we
many
of
us
owe
to
it
a
similar
debt
how
often
when
worn
with
overwork
sorrow
or
anxiety
have
we
taken
down
homer
or
horace
shakespeare
or
milton
and
felt
the
clouds
gradually
roll
away
the
jar
of
nerves
subside
the
consciousness
of
power
replace
physical
exhaustion
and
the
darkness
of
despondency
brighten
once
more
into
the
light
of
life
and
yet
plato
says
jowett
expels
the
poets
from
his
republic
because
they
are
allied
to
sense
because
they
stimulate
the
emotions
because
they
are
thrice
removed
from
the
ideal
truth
in
that
respect
as
in
some
others
few
would
accept
plato
republic
as
being
an
ideal
commonwealth
and
most
would
agree
with
sir
philip
sidney
that
if
you
can
not
bear
the
music
of
poetry
i
must
send
you
in
the
behalf
of
all
poets
that
while
you
live
you
live
in
love
and
never
get
favor
for
lacking
skill
of
a
sonnet
and
when
you
die
your
memory
die
from
the
earth
for
want
of
an
epitaph
poetry
has
often
been
compared
with
painting
and
sculpture
simonides
long
ago
said
that
poetry
is
a
speaking
picture
and
painting
is
mute
poetry
poetry
says
cousin
is
the
first
of
the
arts
because
it
best
represents
the
infinite
and
again
though
the
arts
are
in
some
respects
isolated
yet
there
is
one
which
seems
to
profit
by
the
resources
of
all
and
that
is
poetry
with
words
poetry
can
paint
and
sculpture
she
can
build
edifices
like
an
architect
she
unites
to
some
extent
melody
and
music
she
is
so
to
say
the
center
in
which
all
arts
unite
a
true
poem
is
a
gallery
of
pictures
it
must
i
think
be
admitted
that
painting
and
sculpture
can
give
us
a
clearer
and
more
vivid
idea
of
an
object
we
have
never
seen
than
any
description
can
convey
but
when
we
have
once
seen
it
then
on
the
contrary
there
are
many
points
which
the
poet
brings
before
us
and
which
perhaps
neither
in
the
representation
nor
even
in
nature
should
we
perceive
for
ourselves
objects
can
be
most
vividly
brought
before
us
by
the
artist
actions
by
the
poet
space
is
the
domain
of
art
time
of
poetry
take
for
instance
as
a
typical
instance
female
beauty
how
labored
and
how
cold
any
description
appears
the
greatest
poets
recognize
this
as
for
instance
when
scott
wishes
us
to
realize
the
lady
of
the
lake
he
does
not
attempt
any
description
but
just
mentions
her
attitude
and
then
adds
and
did
grecian
chisel
trace
a
nymph
a
naiad
or
a
grace
of
finer
form
or
lovelier
face
a
great
poet
indeed
must
be
inspired
he
must
possess
an
exquisite
sense
of
beauty
and
feelings
deeper
than
those
of
most
men
and
yet
well
under
his
control
the
milton
of
poetry
is
the
man
in
his
own
magnificent
phrase
of
devout
prayer
to
that
eternal
spirit
that
can
enrich
with
all
utterance
and
knowledge
and
sends
out
his
seraphim
with
the
hallowed
fire
of
his
altar
to
touch
and
purify
the
lips
of
whom
he
pleases
and
if
from
one
point
of
view
poetry
brings
home
to
us
the
immeasurable
inequalities
of
different
minds
on
the
other
hand
it
teaches
us
that
genius
is
no
affair
of
rank
or
wealth
i
think
of
chatterton
the
marvellous
boy
the
sleepless
soul
that
perish
in
his
pride
of
burns
that
walk
in
glory
and
in
joy
behind
his
plough
upon
the
a
man
may
be
a
poet
and
yet
write
no
verse
but
not
if
he
writes
bad
or
poor
ones
mediocribus
esse
poetis

poets
like
writers
generally
fade
gradually
into
dreamland
but
the
great
poets
remain
always
poetry
will
not
live
unless
it
be
alive
that
which
comes
from
the
head
goes
to
the
heart
and
milton
truly
said
that
he
who
would
not
be
frustrate
of
his
hope
to
write
well
hereafter
in
laudable
things
ought
himself
to
be
a
true
poem
for
he
who
having
no
touch
of
the
muses
madness
in
his
soul
comes
to
the
door
and
thinks
he
will
get
into
the
temple
by
the
help
of
art
he
i
say
and
his
poetry
are
not
admitted
but
the
work
of
the
true
poet
is
immortal
for
have
not
the
verses
of
homer
continued
years
or
more
without
the
loss
of
a
syllable
or
a
letter
during
which
time
infinite
palaces
temples
castles
cities
have
been
decayed
and
demolished
it
is
not
possible
to
have
the
true
pictures
or
statues
of
cyrus
alexander
caesar
no
nor
of
the
kings
or
great
personages
of
much
later
years
for
the
originals
can
not
last
and
the
copies
can
not
but
lose
of
the
life
and
truth
but
the
images
of
men
wits
and
knowledge
remain
in
books
exempted
from
the
wrong
of
time
and
capable
of
perpetual
renovation
neither
are
they
fitly
to
be
called
images
because
they
generate
still
and
cast
their
seeds
in
the
minds
of
others
provoking
and
causing
infinite
actions
and
opinions
in
succeeding
ages
so
that
if
the
invention
of
the
ship
was
thought
so
noble
which
carrieth
riches
and
commodities
from
place
to
place
and
consociateth
the
most
remote
regions
in
participation
of
their
fruits
how
much
more
are
letters
to
be
magnified
which
as
ships
pass
through
the
vast
seas
of
time
and
make
ages
so
distant
to
participate
of
the
wisdom
illuminations
and
inventions
the
one
of
the
other
the
poet
requires
many
qualifications
who
has
traced
says
cousin
the
plan
of
this
poem
reason
who
has
given
it
life
and
charm
love
and
who
has
guided
reason
and
love
the
will
all
men
have
some
imagination
but
the
lover
and
the
poet
are
of
imagination
all
compact
the
poet
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
doth
glance
from
heaven
to
earth
from
earth
to
heaven
and
as
imagination
bodies
forth
the
forms
of
things
unknown
the
poet
pen
turns
them
to
shapes
and
gives
to
airy
nothing
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
poetry
is
the
fruit
of
genius
but
it
can
not
be
produced
without
labor
moore
one
of
the
airiest
of
poets
tells
us
that
he
was
a
slow
and
painstaking
workman
the
works
of
our
greatest
poets
are
all
episodes
in
that
one
great
poem
which
the
genius
of
man
has
created
since
the
commencement
of
human
history
a
distinguished
mathematician
is
said
once
to
have
inquired
what
was
proved
by
milton
in
his
and
there
are
no
doubt
still
some
who
ask
themselves
even
if
they
shrink
from
putting
the
question
to
others
whether
poetry
is
of
any
use
just
as
if
to
give
pleasure
were
not
useful
in
itself
no
true
utilitarian
however
would
feel
this
doubt
since
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
is
the
rule
of
his
philosophy
we
must
not
estimate
the
works
of
genius
merely
with
reference
to
the
pleasure
they
afford
even
when
pleasure
was
their
principal
object
we
must
also
regard
the
intelligence
which
they
presuppose
and
exercise
thoroughly
to
enjoy
poetry
we
must
not
so
limit
ourselves
but
must
rise
to
a
higher
ideal
yes
constantly
in
reading
poetry
a
sense
for
the
best
the
really
excellent
and
of
the
strength
and
joy
to
be
drawn
from
it
should
be
present
in
our
minds
and
should
govern
our
estimate
of
what
we
read
cicero
in
his
oration
for
archias
well
asked
has
not
this
man
then
a
right
to
my
love
to
my
admiration
to
all
the
means
which
i
can
employ
in
his
defence
for
we
are
instructed
by
all
the
greatest
and
most
learned
of
mankind
that
education
precepts
and
practice
can
in
every
other
branch
of
learning
produce
excellence
but
a
poet
is
formed
by
the
hand
of
nature
he
is
aroused
by
mental
vigor
and
inspired
by
what
we
may
call
the
spirit
of
divinity
itself
therefore
our
ennius
has
a
right
to
give
to
poets
the
epithet
of
holy
because
they
are
as
it
were
lent
to
mankind
by
the
indulgent
bounty
of
the
gods
poetry
says
shelley
awakens
and
enlarges
the
mind
itself
by
rendering
it
the
receptacle
of
a
thousand
unapprehended
combinations
of
thought
poetry
lifts
the
veil
from
the
hidden
beauty
of
the
world
and
makes
familiar
objects
be
as
if
they
were
not
familiar
it
reproduces
all
that
it
represents
and
the
impersonations
clothed
in
its
elysian
light
stand
thenceforward
in
the
minds
of
those
who
have
once
contemplated
them
as
memorials
of
that
gentle
and
exalted
content
which
extends
itself
over
all
thoughts
and
actions
with
which
it
and
again
all
high
poetry
is
infinite
it
is
as
the
first
acorn
which
contained
all
oaks
potentially
veil
after
veil
may
be
undrawn
and
the
inmost
naked
beauty
of
the
meaning
never
exposed
a
great
poem
is
a
fountain
forever
overflowing
with
the
waters
of
wisdom
and
delight
or
as
he
has
expressed
himself
in
his
ode
to
a
skylark
higher
still
and
higher
from
the
earth
thou
springest
like
a
cloud
of
fire
the
blue
deep
thou
wingest
and
singing
still
dost
soar
and
soaring
ever
singest
like
a
poet
hidden
in
the
light
of
thought
singing
hymns
unbidden
till
the
world
is
wrought
to
sympathy
with
hopes
and
fears
it
heeded
not
like
a
golden
in
a
dell
of
dew
scattering
unbeholden
its
aërial
hue
among
the
flowers
and
grass
which
screen
it
from
the
view
we
speak
now
of
the
poet
as
the
maker
or
creator
greek
poiaetaes
the
origin
of
the
word
bard
seems
doubtful
the
hebrews
well
called
their
poets
seers
for
they
not
only
perceive
more
than
others
but
also
help
other
men
to
see
much
which
would
otherwise
be
lost
to
us
the
old
greek
word
was
greek
aoidos
the
bard
or
singer
poetry
lifts
the
veil
from
the
beauty
of
the
world
which
would
otherwise
be
hidden
and
throws
over
the
most
familiar
objects
the
glow
and
halo
of
imagination
the
man
who
has
a
love
for
poetry
can
scarcely
fail
to
derive
intense
pleasure
from
nature
which
to
those
who
love
it
is
all
beauty
to
the
eye
and
music
to
the
ear
yet
nature
never
set
forth
the
earth
in
so
rich
tapestry
as
divers
poets
have
done
neither
with
so
pleasant
rivers
fruitful
trees
flowers
nor
whatsoever
else
may
make
the
earth
more
lovely
in
the
smokiest
city
the
poet
will
transport
us
as
if
by
enchantment
to
the
fresh
air
and
bright
sun
to
the
murmur
of
woods
and
leaves
and
water
to
the
ripple
of
waves
upon
sand
and
enable
us
as
in
some
delightful
dream
to
cast
off
the
cares
and
troubles
of
life
the
poet
indeed
must
have
more
true
knowledge
not
only
of
human
nature
but
of
all
nature
than
other
men
are
gifted
with
crabbe
robinson
tells
us
that
when
a
stranger
once
asked
permission
to
see
wordsworth
study
the
maid
said
this
is
master
library
but
he
studies
in
the
fields
no
wonder
then
that
nature
has
been
said
to
return
the
poet
love
call
it
not
vain
do
not
err
who
say
that
when
the
poet
dies
mute
nature
mourns
her
worshipper
and
celebrates
his
obsequies
swinburne
says
of
blake
and
i
feel
entirely
with
him
though
in
my
case
the
application
would
have
been
different
that
the
sweetness
of
sky
and
leaf
of
grass
and
water
the
bright
light
life
of
bird
child
and
beast
is
so
to
speak
kept
fresh
by
some
graver
sense
of
faithful
and
mysterious
love
explained
and
vivified
by
a
conscience
and
purpose
in
the
artist
hand
and
mind
such
a
fiery
outbreak
of
spring
such
an
insurrection
of
fierce
floral
life
and
radiant
riot
of
childish
power
and
pleasure
no
poet
or
painter
ever
gave
before
such
lustre
of
green
leaves
and
flushed
limbs
kindled
cloud
and
fervent
fleece
was
never
wrought
into
speech
or
shape
to
appreciate
poetry
we
must
not
merely
glance
at
it
or
rush
through
it
or
read
it
in
order
to
talk
or
write
about
it
one
must
compose
oneself
into
the
right
frame
of
mind
of
course
for
one
own
sake
one
will
read
poetry
in
times
of
agitation
sorrow
or
anxiety
but
that
is
another
matter
the
inestimable
treasures
of
poetry
again
are
open
to
all
of
us
the
best
books
are
indeed
the
cheapest
for
the
price
of
a
little
beer
a
little
tobacco
we
can
buy
shakespeare
or
milton
or
indeed
almost
as
many
books
as
a
man
can
read
with
profit
in
a
year
nor
in
considering
the
advantage
of
poetry
to
man
must
we
limit
ourselves
to
its
past
or
present
influence
the
future
of
poetry
says
matthew
arnold
and
no
one
was
more
qualified
to
speak
the
future
of
poetry
is
immense
because
in
poetry
where
it
is
worthy
of
its
high
destinies
our
race
as
time
goes
on
will
find
an
ever
surer
and
surer
stay
but
for
poetry
the
idea
is
everything
the
rest
is
a
world
of
illusion
of
divine
illusion
poetry
attaches
its
emotion
to
the
idea
the
idea
the
fact
the
strongest
part
of
our
religion
is
its
unconscious
poetry
we
should
conceive
of
poetry
worthily
and
more
highly
than
it
has
been
the
custom
to
conceive
of
it
we
should
conceive
of
it
as
capable
of
higher
uses
and
called
to
higher
destinies
than
those
which
in
general
men
have
assigned
to
it
hitherto
poetry
has
been
well
called
the
record
of
the
best
and
happiest
moments
of
the
happiest
and
best
minds
it
is
the
light
of
life
the
very
image
of
life
expressed
in
its
eternal
truth
it
immortalizes
all
that
is
best
and
most
beautiful
in
the
world
it
purges
from
our
inward
sight
the
film
of
familiarity
which
obscures
from
us
the
wonder
of
our
being
it
is
the
center
and
circumference
of
knowledge
and
poets
are
mirrors
of
the
gigantic
shadows
which
futurity
caste
upon
the
present
poetry
in
effect
lengthens
life
it
creates
for
us
time
if
time
be
realized
as
the
succession
of
ideas
and
not
of
minutes
it
is
the
breath
and
finer
spirit
of
all
knowledge
it
is
bound
neither
by
time
nor
space
but
lives
in
the
spirit
of
man
what
greater
praise
can
be
given
than
the
saying
that
life
should
be

music
music
is
in
one
sense
far
more
ancient
than
man
and
the
voice
was
from
the
very
commencement
of
human
existence
a
source
of
melody
but
so
far
as
musical
instruments
are
concerned
it
is
probable
that
percussion
came
first
then
wind
instruments
and
lastly
those
with
strings
first
the
drum
then
the
flute
and
thirdly
the
lyre
the
early
history
of
music
is
however
unfortunately
wrapped
in
much
obscurity
the
use
of
letters
long
preceded
the
invention
of
notes
and
tradition
in
such
a
matter
can
tell
us
but
little
the
contest
between
marsyas
and
apollo
is
supposed
by
some
to
typify
the
struggle
between
the
flute
and
the
lyre
marsyas
representing
the
archaic
flute
apollo
the
champion
of
the
lyre
the
latter
of
course
was
victorious
it
sets
the
voice
free
and
the
sound
of
music
that
is
born
of
human
breath
comes
straighter
to
the
soul
than
any
strain
the
hand
alone
can
make
various
myths
have
grown
up
to
explain
the
origin
of
music
one
greek
tradition
was
to
the
effect
grasshoppers
were
human
beings
themselves
in
a
world
before
the
muses
that
when
the
muses
came
being
ravished
with
delight
they
sang
and
sang
and
forgot
to
eat
until
they
died
of
hunger
for
the
love
of
song
and
they
carry
to
heaven
the
report
of
those
who
honor
them
on
earth
the
old
writers
and
commentators
tell
us
that
pythagoras
as
he
was
one
day
meditating
on
the
want
of
some
rule
to
guide
the
ear
analogous
to
what
had
been
used
to
help
the
other
senses
chanced
to
pass
by
a
blacksmith
shop
and
observing
that
the
hammers
which
were
four
in
number
sounded
very
harmoniously
he
had
them
weighed
and
found
them
to
be
in
the
proportion
of
six
eight
nine
and
twelve
upon
this
he
suspended
four
strings
of
equal
length
and
thickness
fastened
weights
in
the
proportions
to
each
of
them
respectively
and
found
that
they
gave
the
same
sounds
that
the
hammers
had
done
viz
the
fourth
fifth
and
octave
to
the
gravest
tone
however
this
may
be
it
would
appear
that
the
lyre
had
at
first
four
strings
only
terpander
is
said
to
have
given
it
three
more
and
an
eighth
was
subsequently
added
we
have
unfortunately
no
specimens
of
greek
or
roman
or
even
of
early
christian
music
the
chinese
indicated
the
notes
by
words
or
their
initials
the
lowest
was
termed
koung
or
the
emperor
as
being
the
foundation
on
which
all
were
supported
the
second
was
tschang
the
prime
minister
the
third
the
subject
the
fourth
public
business
the
fifth
the
mirror
of
heaven
the
greeks
also
had
a
name
for
each
note
the
gregorian
notes
were
not
invented
until
six
hundred
years
after
gregory
death
the
monastery
of
gall
possesses
a
copy
of
antiphonary
made
about
the
year
by
a
chorister
who
was
sent
from
rome
to
charlemagne
to
reform
the
northern
music
and
in
this
the
notes
are
indicated
by
pneumss
from
which
our
notes
were
gradually
developed
and
first
arranged
along
one
line
to
which
others
were
gradually
added
but
i
must
not
enlarge
on
this
interesting
subject
in
the
matter
of
music
englishmen
have
certainly
deserved
well
of
the
world
even
as
long
ago
as
giraldus
cambrensis
bishop
of
david
says
the
britons
do
not
sing
their
tunes
in
unison
like
the
inhabitants
of
other
countries
but
in
different
parts
so
that
when
a
company
of
singers
meet
to
sing
as
is
usual
in
this
country
as
many
different
parts
are
heard
as
there
are
singers
the
most
ancient
known
piece
of
music
for
several
voices
is
an
english
four
men
song
summer
is
a
coming
in
which
is
considered
to
be
at
least
as
early
as
and
is
now
in
the
british
museum
the
venetian
ambassador
in
the
time
of
henry
viii
said
of
our
english
church
music
the
mass
was
sung
by
his
majesty
choristers
whose
voices
are
more
heavenly
than
human
they
did
not
chant
like
men
but
like
angels
speaking
of
purcell
anthem
be
merciful
to
me
o
god
burney
says
it
is
throughout
admirable
indeed
to
my
conception
there
is
no
better
music
existing
of
the
kind
than
the
opening
of
this
anthem
in
which
the
verse
will
praise
god
and
the
last
movement
in
c
natural
are
in
melody
harmony
and
modulation
truly
divine
music
burney
says
that
purcell
was
as
much
the
pride
of
an
englishman
in
music
as
shakespeare
in
productions
of
the
stage
milton
in
epic
poetry
locke
in
metaphysics
or
sir
isaac
newton
in
philosophy
and
mathematics
and
yet
purcell
music
is
unfortunately
but
little
known
to
us
now
as
macfarren
says
to
our
great
loss
the
authors
of
some
of
the
loveliest
music
and
even
in
some
cases
that
of
comparatively
recent
times
are
unknown
to
us
this
is
the
case
for
instance
with
the
exquisite
song
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
the
words
of
which
were
taken
by
jonson
from
philostratus
and
which
has
been
considered
as
the
most
beautiful
of
all
people
songs
the
music
of
god
save
the
queen
has
been
adopted
in
more
than
half
a
dozen
other
countries
and
yet
the
authorship
is
a
matter
of
doubt
being
attributed
by
some
to
john
bull
by
others
to
carey
it
was
apparently
first
sung
in
a
tavern
in
cornhill
both
the
music
and
words
of
o
death
rock
me
to
sleep
are
said
to
be
by
anne
boleyn
stay
corydon
and
sweet
bees
by
wildye
the
first
of
madrigal
writers
rule
britannia
was
composed
by
arne
and
originally
formed
part
of
his
masque
of
first
performed
in
at
cliefden
near
maidenhead
to
arne
we
are
also
indebted
for
the
music
of
where
the

the
vicar
of

unto
these
yellow
sands
we
owe
to
purcell
sigh
no
more
ladies
to
stevens
home
sweet
home
to
bishop
there
is
a
curious
melancholy
in
national
music
which
is
generally
in
the
minor
key
indeed
this
holds
good
with
the
music
of
savage
races
generally
they
appear
moreover
to
have
no
love
songs
herodotus
tells
us
that
during
the
whole
time
he
was
in
egypt
he
only
heard
one
song
and
that
was
a
sad
one
my
own
experience
there
was
the
same
some
tendency
to
melancholy
seems
indeed
inherent
in
music
and
jessica
is
not
alone
in
the
feeling
i
am
never
merry
when
i
hear
sweet
music
the
epitaphs
on
musicians
have
been
in
some
cases
very
well
expressed
such
for
instance
is
the
following
philips
whose
touch
harmonious
could
remove
the
pangs
of
guilty
power
and
hapless
love
rest
here
distressed
by
poverty
no
more
here
find
that
calm
thou
so
oft
before
sleep
undisturbed
within
this
peaceful
shrine
till
angels
wake
thee
with
a
note
like
thine
still
more
so
that
on
purcell
whose
premature
death
was
so
irreparable
a
loss
to
english
music
here
lies
henry
purcell
who
left
this
life
and
is
gone
to
that
blessed
place
where
only
his
harmony
can
be
exceeded
the
histories
of
music
contain
many
curious
anecdotes
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
different
works
have
been
composed
rossini
tells
us
that
he
wrote
the
overture
to
the
gazza
ladra
on
the
very
day
of
the
first
performance
in
the
upper
loft
of
the
la
scala
where
he
had
been
confined
by
the
manager
under
the
guard
of
four
who
threw
the
text
out
of
the
window
to
copyists
bit
by
bit
as
it
was
composed
tartini
is
said
to
have
composed
il
trillo
del
diavolo
considered
to
be
his
best
work
in
a
dream
rossini
speaking
of
the
chorus
in
g
minor
in
his
dal
tuo
stellato
soglio
tells
us
while
i
was
writing
the
chorus
in
g
minor
i
suddenly
dipped
my
pen
into
a
medicine
bottle
instead
of
the
ink
i
made
a
blot
and
when
i
dried
this
with
the
sand
it
took
the
form
of
a
natural
which
instantly
gave
me
the
idea
of
the
effect
the
change
from
g
minor
to
g
major
would
make
and
to
this
blot
is
all
the
effect
if
any
due
but
these
of
course
are
exceptional
cases
there
are
other
forms
of
music
which
though
not
strictly
entitled
to
the
name
are
yet
capable
of
giving
intense
pleasure
to
the
sportsman
what
music
can
excel
that
of
the
hounds
themselves
the
cawing
of
rooks
has
been
often
quoted
as
a
sound
which
has
no
actual
beauty
of
its
own
and
yet
which
is
delightful
from
its
associations
there
is
however
a
true
music
of
nature
the
song
of
birds
the
whisper
of
leaves
the
ripple
of
waters
upon
a
sandy
shore
the
wail
of
wind
or
sea
there
was
also
an
ancient
impression
that
the
heavenly
bodies
give
out
music
as
well
as
light
the
music
of
the
spheres
is
proverbial
there
not
the
smallest
orb
which
thou
beholdest
but
in
his
motion
like
an
angel
sings
still
quiring
to
the
cherubims
such
harmony
is
in
immortal
souls
but
while
this
muddy
vesture
of
decay
doth
grossly
close
it
in
we
can
not
hear
it
music
indeed
often
seems
as
if
it
scarcely
belonged
to
this
material
universe
but
was
a
tone
of
some
world
far
from
ours
where
music
and
moonlight
and
feeling
are
one
there
is
music
in
speech
as
well
as
in
song
not
merely
in
the
voice
of
those
we
love
and
the
charm
of
association
but
in
actual
melody
as
milton
says
the
angel
ended
and
in
adam
ear
so
charming
left
his
voice
that
he
awhile
thought
him
still
speaking
still
stood
fixed
to
hear
it
is
remarkable
that
more
pains
are
not
taken
with
the
voice
in
conversation
as
well
as
in
singing
for
what
plea
so
tainted
and
corrupt
but
being
seasoned
with
a
gracious
voice
obscures
the
show
of
evil
it
may
be
true
as
a
general
rule
that
the
man
that
hath
no
music
in
himself
nor
is
not
moved
with
concord
of
sweet
sounds
is
fit
for
treasons
stratagems
and
spoils
but
there
are
some
notable
exceptions
johnson
had
no
love
of
music
on
one
occasion
hearing
that
a
certain
piece
of
music
was
very
difficult
he
expressed
his
regret
that
it
was
not
impossible
poets
as
might
have
been
expected
have
sung
most
sweetly
in
praise
of
song
they
have
moreover
done
so
from
the
most
opposite
points
of
view
milton
invokes
it
as
a
luxury
and
ever
against
eating
cares
lap
me
in
soft
lydian
airs
married
to
immortal
verse
such
as
the
meeting
soul
may
pierce
in
notes
with
many
a
winding
bout
of
linked
sweetness
long
drawn
out
with
wanton
heed
and
giddy
cunning
the
melting
voice
through
mazes
running
untwisting
all
the
chains
that
tie
the
hidden
soul
of
harmony
sometimes
as
a
temptation
so
spenser
says
of
phaedria
and
she
more
sweet
than
any
bird
on
bough
would
oftentimes
amongst
them
bear
a
part
and
strive
to
passe
as
she
could
well
enough
their
native
musicke
by
her
skilful
art
or
as
an
element
of
pure
happiness
there
is
in
souls
a
sympathy
with
sounds
and
as
the
mind
is
pitched
the
ear
is
pleased
with
melting
airs
or
martial
brisk
or
grave
some
chord
in
unison
with
what
we
hear
is
touched
within
us
and
the
heart
replies
how
soft
the
music
of
those
village
bells
falling
at
intervals
upon
the
ear
in
cadence
sweet
now
dying
all
away
now
pealing
loud
again
and
louder
still
clear
and
sonorous
as
the
gale
comes
on
as
touching
the
human
heart
the
soul
of
music
slumbers
in
the
shell
till
waked
and
kindled
by
the
master
spell
and
feeling
hearts
touch
them
but
lightly
pour
a
thousand
melodies
unheard
before
as
an
education
i
have
sent
books
and
music
there
and
all
those
instruments
with
which
high
spirits
call
the
future
from
its
cradle
and
the
past
out
of
its
grave
and
make
the
present
last
in
thoughts
and
joys
which
sleep
but
can
not
die
folded
within
their
own
eternity
as
an
aid
to
religion
as
from
the
power
of
sacred
lays
the
spheres
began
to
move
and
sung
the
great
creator
praise
to
all
the
blessed
above
so
when
the
last
and
dreadful
hour
this
crumbling
pageant
shall
devour
the
trumpet
shall
be
heard
on
high
the
dead
shall
live
the
living
die
and
music
shall
untune
the
sky
or
again
hark
how
it
falls
and
now
it
steals
along
like
distant
bells
upon
the
lake
at
eve
when
all
is
still
and
now
it
grows
more
strong
as
when
the
choral
train
their
dirges
weave
mellow
and
many
voiced
where
every
close
the
old
minster
roof
in
echoing
waves
reflows
oh
i
am
rapt
aloft
my
spirit
soars
beyond
the
skies
and
leaves
the
stars
behind
lo
angels
lead
me
to
the
happy
shores
and
floating
paeans
fill
the
buoyant
wind
farewell
base
earth
farewell
my
soul
is
freed
the
power
of
music
to
sway
the
feelings
of
man
has
never
been
more
cleverly
portrayed
than
by
dryden
in
the
feast
of
alexander
though
the
circumstances
of
the
case
precluded
any
reference
to
the
influence
of
music
in
its
noblest
aspects
poets
have
always
attributed
to
music
and
who
would
wish
to
deny
it
a
power
even
over
the
inanimate
forces
of
nature
shakespeare
accounts
for
shooting
stars
by
the
attraction
of
music
the
rude
sea
grew
civil
at
her
song
and
certain
stars
shot
madly
from
their
spheres
to
hear
the
music
prose
writers
have
also
been
inspired
by
music
to
their
highest
eloquence
music
says
plato
is
a
moral
law
it
gives
a
soul
to
the
universe
wings
to
the
mind
flight
to
the
imagination
a
charm
to
sadness
gaiety
and
life
to
everything
it
is
the
essence
of
order
and
leads
to
all
that
is
good
just
and
beautiful
of
which
it
is
the
invisible
but
nevertheless
dazzling
passionate
and
eternal
form
music
said
luther
is
a
fair
and
glorious
gift
from
god
i
would
not
for
the
world
renounce
my
humble
share
in
music
music
said
halevy
is
an
art
that
god
has
given
us
in
which
the
voices
of
all
nations
may
unite
their
prayers
in
one
harmonious
rhythm
or
carlyle
music
is
a
kind
of
inarticulate
unfathomable
speech
which
leads
us
to
the
edge
of
the
infinite
and
lets
us
for
moments
gaze
into
it
let
me
also
quote
helmholtz
one
of
the
profoundest
exponents
of
modern
science
just
as
in
the
rolling
ocean
this
movement
rhythmically
repeated
and
yet
rivets
our
attention
and
hurries
us
along
but
whereas
in
the
sea
blind
physical
forces
alone
are
at
work
and
hence
the
final
impression
on
the
spectator
mind
is
nothing
but
solitude
in
a
musical
work
of
art
the
movement
follows
the
outflow
of
the
artist
own
emotions
now
gently
gliding
now
gracefully
leaping
now
violently
stirred
penetrated
or
laboriously
contending
with
the
natural
expression
of
passion
the
stream
of
sound
in
primitive
vivacity
bears
over
into
the
hearer
soul
unimagined
moods
which
the
artist
has
overheard
from
his
own
and
finally
raises
him
up
to
that
repose
of
everlasting
beauty
of
which
god
has
allowed
but
few
of
his
elect
favorites
to
be
the
heralds
there
are
but
seven
notes
in
the
scale
make
them
fourteen
says
newman
yet
what
a
slender
outfit
for
so
vast
an
enterprise
what
science
brings
so
much
out
of
so
little
out
of
what
poor
elements
does
some
great
master
in
it
create
his
new
world
shall
we
say
that
all
this
exuberant
inventiveness
is
a
mere
ingenuity
or
trick
of
art
like
some
game
of
fashion
of
the
day
without
reality
without
meaning
is
it
possible
that
that
inexhaustible
evolution
and
disposition
of
notes
so
rich
yet
so
simple
so
intricate
yet
so
regulated
so
various
yet
so
majestic
should
be
a
mere
sound
which
is
gone
and
perishes
can
it
be
that
those
mysterious
stirrings
of
the
heart
and
keen
emotions
and
strange
yearnings
after
we
know
not
what
and
awful
impressions
from
we
know
not
whence
should
be
wrought
in
us
by
what
is
unsubstantial
and
comes
and
goes
and
begins
and
ends
in
itself
it
is
not
so
it
can
not
be
no
they
have
escaped
from
some
higher
sphere
they
are
the
outpourings
of
eternal
harmony
in
the
medium
of
created
sound
they
are
echoes
from
our
home
they
are
the
voices
of
angels
or
the
magnificat
of
saints
or
the
living
laws
of
divine
governance
or
the
divine
attributes
something
are
they
besides
themselves
which
we
can
not
compass
which
we
can
not
utter
though
mortal
man
and
he
perhaps
not
otherwise
distinguished
above
his
fellows
has
the
gift
of
eliciting
them
poetry
and
music
unite
in
song
from
the
earliest
ages
song
has
been
the
sweet
companion
of
labor
the
rude
chant
of
the
boatman
floats
upon
the
water
the
shepherd
sings
upon
the
hill
the
milkmaid
in
the
dairy
the
ploughman
at
the
plough
every
trade
every
occupation
every
act
and
scene
of
life
has
long
had
its
own
especial
music
the
bride
went
to
her
marriage
the
laborer
to
his
work
the
old
man
to
his
last
long
rest
each
with
appropriate
and
immemorial
music
music
has
been
truly
described
as
the
mother
of
sympathy
the
handmaid
of
religion
and
will
never
exercise
its
full
effect
as
the
emperor
charles
vi
said
to
farinelli
unless
it
aims
not
merely
to
charm
the
ear
but
to
touch
the
heart
there
are
many
who
consider
that
our
life
at
present
is
peculiarly
prosaic
and
mercenary
i
greatly
doubt
whether
that
be
the
case
but
if
so
our
need
for
music
is
all
the
more
imperative
much
as
music
has
already
done
for
man
we
may
hope
even
more
from
it
in
the
future
it
is
moreover
a
joy
for
all
to
appreciate
science
or
art
requires
some
training
and
no
doubt
the
cultivated
ear
will
more
and
more
appreciate
the
beauties
of
music
but
though
there
are
exceptional
individuals
and
even
races
almost
devoid
of
any
love
of
music
still
they
are
happily
but
rare
good
music
moreover
does
not
necessarily
involve
any
considerable
outlay
it
is
even
now
no
mere
luxury
of
the
rich
and
we
may
hope
that
as
time
goes
on
it
will
become
more
and
more
the
comfort
and
solace
of
the

shakespeare
chapter
viii
the
beauties
of
nature
we
are
told
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
that
at
the
close
of
the
sixth
day
god
saw
every
thing
that
he
had
made
and
behold
it
was
very
good
not
merely
good
but
very
good
yet
how
few
of
us
appreciate
the
beautiful
world
in
which
we
live
in
preceding
chapters
i
have
incidentally
though
only
incidentally
referred
to
the
beauties
of
nature
but
any
attempt
however
imperfect
to
sketch
the
blessings
of
life
must
contain
some
special
reference
to
this
lovely
world
itself
which
the
greeks
happily
called
greek
chosmos
beauty
hamerton
in
his
charming
work
on
says
there
are
i
believe
four
new
experiences
for
which
no
description
ever
adequately
prepares
us
the
first
sight
of
the
sea
the
first
journey
in
the
desert
the
sight
of
flowing
molten
lava
and
a
walk
on
a
great
glacier
we
feel
in
each
case
that
the
strange
thing
is
pure
nature
as
much
nature
as
a
familiar
english
moor
yet
so
extraordinary
that
we
might
be
in
another
planet
but
it
would
i
think
be
easier
to
enumerate
the
wonders
of
nature
for
which
description
can
prepare
us
than
those
which
are
altogether
beyond
the
power
of
language
many
of
us
however
walk
through
the
world
like
ghosts
as
if
we
were
in
it
but
not
of
it
we
have
eyes
and
see
not
ears
and
hear
not
to
look
is
much
less
easy
than
to
overlook
and
to
be
able
to
see
what
we
do
see
is
a
great
gift
ruskin
maintains
that
the
greatest
thing
a
human
soul
ever
does
in
this
world
is
to
see
something
and
tell
what
it
saw
in
a
plain
way
i
do
not
suppose
that
his
eyes
are
better
than
ours
but
how
much
more
he
sees
with
them
we
must
look
before
we
can
expect
to
see
to
the
attentive
eye
says
emerson
each
moment
of
the
year
has
its
own
beauty
and
in
the
same
field
it
beholds
every
hour
a
picture
that
was
never
seen
before
and
shall
never
be
seen
again
the
heavens
change
every
moment
and
reflect
their
glory
or
gloom
on
the
plains
beneath
the
love
of
nature
is
a
great
gift
and
if
it
is
frozen
or
crushed
out
the
character
can
hardly
fail
to
suffer
from
the
loss
i
will
not
indeed
say
that
a
person
who
does
not
love
nature
is
necessarily
bad
or
that
one
who
does
is
necessarily
good
but
it
is
to
most
minds
a
great
help
many
as
miss
cobbe
says
enter
the
temple
through
the
gate
called
beautiful
there
are
doubtless
some
to
whom
none
of
the
beautiful
wonders
of
nature
neither
the
glories
of
the
rising
or
setting
sun
the
magnificent
spectacle
of
the
boundless
ocean
sometimes
so
grand
in
its
peaceful
tranquillity
at
others
so
majestic
in
its
mighty
power
the
forests
agitated
by
the
storm
or
alive
with
the
song
of
birds
nor
the
glaciers
and
mountains
there
are
doubtless
some
whom
none
of
these
magnificent
spectacles
can
move
whom
all
the
glories
of
heaven
and
earth
may
pass
in
daily
succession
without
touching
their
hearts
or
elevating
their
minds
such
men
are
indeed
pitiable
but
happily
they
are
exceptions
if
we
can
none
of
us
as
yet
fully
appreciate
the
beauties
of
nature
we
are
beginning
to
do
so
more
and
more
for
most
of
us
the
early
summer
has
a
special
charm
the
very
life
is
luxury
the
air
is
full
of
scent
and
sound
and
sunshine
of
the
song
of
birds
and
the
murmur
of
insects
the
meadows
gleam
with
golden
buttercups
it
almost
seems
as
if
one
could
see
the
grass
grow
and
the
buds
open
the
bees
hum
for
very
joy
and
the
air
is
full
of
a
thousand
scents
above
all
perhaps
that
of
hay
the
exquisite
beauty
and
delight
of
a
fine
summer
day
in
the
country
has
never
perhaps
been
more
truly
and
therefore
more
beautifully
described
than
by
jefferies
in
his
pageant
of
summer
i
linger
he
says
in
the
midst
of
the
long
grass
the
luxury
of
the
leaves
and
the
song
in
the
very
air
i
seem
as
if
i
could
feel
all
the
glowing
life
the
sunshine
gives
and
the
south
wind
calls
to
being
the
endless
grass
the
endless
leaves
the
immense
strength
of
the
oak
expanding
the
unalloyed
joy
of
finch
and
blackbird
from
all
of
them
i
receive
a
little
in
the
blackbird
melody
one
note
is
mine
in
the
dance
of
the
leaf
shadows
the
formed
maze
is
for
me
though
the
motion
is
theirs
the
flowers
with
a
thousand
faces
have
collected
the
kisses
of
the
morning
feeling
with
them
i
receive
some
at
least
of
their
fulness
of
life
never
could
i
have
enough
never
stay
long
enough
the
hours
when
the
mind
is
absorbed
by
beauty
are
the
only
hours
when
we
really
live
so
that
the
longer
we
can
stay
among
these
things
so
much
the
more
is
snatched
from
inevitable
time
these
are
the
only
hours
that
are
not
hours
that
absorb
the
soul
and
fill
it
with
beauty
this
is
real
life
and
all
else
is
illusion
or
mere
endurance
to
be
beautiful
and
to
be
calm
without
mental
fear
is
the
ideal
of
nature
if
i
can
not
achieve
it
at
least
i
can
think
it
this
chapter
is
already
so
long
that
i
can
not
touch
on
the
contrast
and
variety
of
the
seasons
each
with
its
own
special
charm
and
interest
as
the
daughters
of
the
year
dance
into
light
and
die
into
the
shade
our
countrymen
derive
great
pleasure
from
the
animal
kingdom
in
hunting
shooting
and
fishing
thus
obtaining
fresh
air
and
exercise
and
being
led
into
much
varied
and
beautiful
scenery
still
it
will
probably
ere
long
be
recognized
that
even
from
a
purely
selfish
point
of
view
killing
animals
is
not
the
way
to
get
the
greatest
enjoyment
from
them
how
much
more
interesting
would
every
walk
in
the
country
be
if
man
would
but
treat
other
animals
with
kindness
so
that
they
might
approach
us
without
fear
and
we
might
have
the
constant
pleasure
of
watching
their
winning
ways
their
origin
and
history
structure
and
habits
senses
and
intelligence
offer
an
endless
field
of
interest
and
wonder
the
richness
of
life
is
wonderful
any
one
who
will
sit
down
quietly
on
the
grass
and
watch
a
little
will
be
indeed
surprised
at
the
number
and
variety
of
living
beings
every
one
with
a
special
history
of
its
own
every
one
offering
endless
problems
of
great
interest
if
indeed
thy
heart
were
right
then
would
every
creature
be
to
thee
a
mirror
of
lifer
and
a
book
of
holy
doctrine
the
study
of
natural
history
has
the
special
advantage
of
carrying
us
into
the
country
and
the
open
air
not
but
what
towns
are
beautiful
too
they
teem
with
human
interest
and
historical
associations
wordsworth
was
an
intense
lover
of
nature
yet
does
he
not
tell
us
in
lines
which
every
londoner
will
appreciate
that
he
knew
nothing
in
nature
more
fair
no
calm
more
deep
than
the
city
of
london
at
early
dawn
earth
has
not
anything
to
show
more
fair
dull
would
he
be
of
soul
who
could
pass
by
a
sight
so
touching
in
its
majesty
this
city
now
doth
like
a
garment
wear
the
beauty
of
the
morning
silent
bare
ships
towers
domes
theatres
and
temples
lie
open
unto
the
fields
and
to
the
sky
all
bright
and
glittering
in
the
smokeless
air
never
did
sun
more
beautifully
steep
in
his
first
splendor
valley

or
hill
saw
i
never
felt
a
calm
so
deep
the
river
glideth
at
its
own
sweet
will
dear
god
the
very
houses
seem
asleep
and
all
that
mighty
heart
is
lying
still
milton
also
described
london
as
too
blest
abode
no
loveliness
we
see
in
all
the
earth
but
it
abounds
in
thee
but
after
being
some
time
in
a
great
city
one
feels
a
longing
for
the
country
the
meanest
floweret
of
the
vale
the
simplest
note
that
swells
the
gale
the
common
sun
the
air
the
skies
to
him
are
opening
paradise
here
gray
justly
places
flowers
in
the
first
place
for
when
in
any
great
town
we
think
of
the
country
flowers
seem
first
to
suggest
themselves
flowers
says
ruskin
seem
intended
for
the
solace
of
ordinary
humanity
children
love
them
quiet
tender
contented
ordinary
people
love
them
as
they
grow
luxurious
and
disorderly
people
rejoice
in
them
gathered
they
are
the
cottager
treasure
and
in
the
crowded
town
mark
as
with
a
little
broken
fragment
of
rainbow
the
windows
of
the
workers
in
whose
heart
rest
the
covenant
of
peace
but
in
the
crowded
street
or
even
in
the
formal
garden
flowers
always
seem
to
me
at
least
as
if
they
were
pining
for
the
freedom
of
the
woods
and
fields
where
they
can
live
and
grow
as
they
please
there
are
flowers
for
almost
all
seasons
and
all
places
flowers
for
spring
summer
and
autumn
while
even
in
the
very
depth
of
winter
here
and
there
one
makes
its
appearance
there
are
flowers
of
the
fields
and
woods
and
hedgerows
of
the
seashore
and
the
lake
margin
of
the
up
to
the
very
edge
of
the
eternal
snow
and
what
an
infinite
variety
they
present
daffodils
that
come
before
the
swallow
dares
and
take
the
winds
of
march
with
beauty
violets
dim
but
sweeter
than
the
lids
of
juno
eyes
or
cytherea
breath
pale
primroses
that
die
unmarried
ere
they
can
behold
bright
phoebus
in
his
strength
a
malady
most
incident
to
maids
bold
oxlips
and
the
crown
imperial
lilies
of
all
kinds
the
being
one
nor
are
they
mere
delights
to
the
eye
they
are
full
of
mystery
and
suggestions
they
almost
seem
like
enchanted
princesses
waiting
for
some
princely
deliverer
wordsworth
tells
us
that
to
me
the
meanest
flower
that
blows
can
give
thoughts
that
do
often
lie
too
deep
for
tears
every
color
again
every
variety
of
form
has
some
purpose
and
explanation
and
yet
lovely
as
flowers
are
leaves
add
even
more
to
the
beauty
of
nature
trees
in
our
northern
latitudes
seldom
own
large
flowers
and
though
of
course
there
are
notable
exceptions
such
as
the
still
even
in
these
cases
the
flowers
live
only
a
few
days
while
the
leaves
last
for
months
every
tree
indeed
is
a
picture
in
itself
the
gnarled
and
rugged
oak
the
symbol
and
source
of
our
navy
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
druids
the
type
of
strength
the
sovereign
of
british
trees
the
chestnut
with
its
beautiful
tapering
and
rich
green
glossy
leaves
its
delicious
fruit
and
to
the
durability
of
which
we
owe
the
grand
and
historic
roof
of
westminster
abbey
the
birch
is
the
queen
of
trees
with
her
feathery
foliage
scarcely
visible
in
spring
but
turning
to
leaves
of
gold
in
autumn
the
pendulous
twigs
tinged
with
purple
and
silver
stems
so
brilliantly
marked
with
black
and
white
the
elm
forms
grand
masses
of
foliage
which
turn
a
beautiful
golden
yellow
in
autumn
and
the
black
poplar
with
its
perpendicular
leaves
rustling
and
trembling
with
every
breath
of
wind
towers
over
most
other
forest
trees
the
beech
enlivens
the
country
by
its
tender
green
in
spring
rich
green
in
summer
and
glorious
gold
and
orange
in
autumn
set
off
by
the
graceful
gray
stems
and
has
moreover
such
a
wealth
of
leaves
that
in
autumn
there
are
enough
not
only
to
clothe
the
tree
itself
but
to
cover
the
grass
underneath
if
the
beech
owes
much
to
its
delicate
gray
stem
even
more
beautiful
is
the
reddish
crimson
of
the
scotch
pines
in
such
charming
contrast
with
the
rich
green
of
the
foliage
by
which
it
is
shown
off
rather
than
hidden
and
with
the
green
spires
of
the
firs
they
keep
the
woods
warm
in
winter
nor
must
i
overlook
the
smaller
trees
the
yew
with
its
thick
green
foliage
the
wild
guelder
rose
which
lights
up
the
woods
in
autumn
with
translucent
glossy
berries
and
leaves
or
the
bryonies
the
briar
the
traveler
joy
and
many
another
plant
even
humbler
perhaps
and
yet
each
with
some
exquisite
beauty
and
grace
of
its
own
so
that
we
must
all
have
sometimes
felt
our
hearts
overflowing
with
gladness
and
gratitude
as
if
the
woods
were
full
of
music
as
if
the
woods
were
filled
so
full
with
song
there
seemed
no
room
for
sense
of
wrong
on
the
whole
no
doubt
woodlands
are
less
beautiful
in
the
winter
yet
even
then
the
delicate
tracery
of
the
branches
which
can
not
be
so
well
seen
when
they
are
clothed
with
leaves
has
a
special
beauty
of
its
own
while
every
now
and
then
hoar
frost
or
snow
settles
like
silver
on
every
branch
and
twig
lighting
up
the
forest
as
if
by
enchantment
in
preparation
for
some
fairy
festival
i
feel
with
jefferies
that
by
day
or
by
night
summer
or
winter
beneath
trees
the
heart
feels
nearer
to
that
depth
of
life
which
the
far
sky
means
the
rest
of
spirit
found
only
in
beauty
ideal
and
pure
comes
there
because
the
distance
seems
within
touch
of
thought
the
general
effect
of
forests
in
tropical
regions
must
be
very
different
from
that
of
those
in
our
latitudes
kingsley
describes
it
as
one
of
helplessness
confusion
awe
all
but
terror
the
trunks
are
very
lofty
and
straight
and
rising
to
a
great
height
without
a
branch
so
that
the
wood
seems
at
first
comparatively
open
in
brazilian
forests
for
instance
the
trees
struggle
upward
and
the
foliage
forms
an
unbroken
canopy
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
overhead
here
indeed
high
up
in
the
air
is
the
real
life
of
the
forest
everything
seems
to
climb
to
the
light
the
quadrupeds
climb
birds
climb
reptiles
climb
and
the
variety
of
climbing
plants
is
far
greater
than
anything
to
which
we
are
accustomed
many
savage
nations
worship
trees
and
i
really
think
my
first
feeling
would
be
one
of
delight
and
interest
rather
than
of
surprise
if
some
day
when
i
am
alone
in
a
wood
one
of
the
trees
were
to
speak
to
me
even
by
day
there
is
something
mysterious
in
a
forest
and
this
is
much
more
the
case
at
night
with
wood
water
seems
to
be
naturally
associated
without
water
no
landscape
is
complete
while
overhead
the
clouds
add
beauty
to
the
heavens
themselves
the
spring
and
the
rivulet
the
brook
the
river
and
the
lake
seem
to
give
life
to
nature
and
were
indeed
regarded
by
our
ancestors
as
living
entities
themselves
water
is
beautiful
in
the
morning
mist
in
the
broad
lake
in
the
glancing
stream
or
the
river
pool
in
the
wide
ocean
beautiful
in
all
its
varied
moods
water
nourishes
vegetation
it
clothes
the
lowlands
with
green
and
the
mountains
with
snow
it
sculptures
the
rocks
and
excavates
the
valleys
in
most
cases
acting
mainly
through
the
soft
rain
though
our
harder
rocks
are
still
grooved
by
the
of
bygone
ages
the
refreshing
pour
of
water
upon
the
earth
is
scarcely
greater
than
that
which
it
exercises
on
the
mind
of
man
after
a
long
spell
of
work
how
delightful
it
is
to
sit
by
a
lake
or
river
or
on
the
seashore
and
enjoy
a
little
murmur
in
mine
ear
a
little
ripple
at
my
feet
every
englishman
loves
the
sight
of
the
sea
we
feel
that
it
is
to
us
a
second
home
it
seems
to
vivify
the
very
atmosphere
so
that
sea
air
is
proverbial
as
a
tonic
and
makes
the
blood
dance
in
our
veins
the
ocean
gives
an
impression
of
freedom
and
grandeur
more
intense
perhaps
than
the
aspect
of
the
heavens
themselves
a
poor
woman
from
manchester
on
being
taken
to
the
seaside
is
said
to
have
expressed
her
delight
on
seeing
for
the
first
time
something
of
which
there
was
enough
for
everybody
the
sea
coast
is
always
interesting
when
we
think
of
the
cliff
sections
with
their
histories
of
bygone
ages
the
shore
itself
teeming
with
seaweeds
and
animals
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
tide
or
thrown
up
from
deeper
water
by
the
waves
the
weird
cries
of
seabirds
the
delightful
feeling
that
with
every
breath
we
are
laying
in
a
store
of
fresh
life
and
health
and
energy
it
is
impossible
to
all
we
owe
to
the
sea
it
is
moreover
always
changing
we
went
for
our
holiday
this
year
to
lyme
regis
let
me
attempt
to
describe
the
changes
in
the
view
from
our
windows
during
a
single
day
our
opened
on
to
a
little
lawn
beyond
which
the
ground
drops
suddenly
to
the
sea
while
over
about
two
miles
of
water
were
the
hills
of
the
dorsetshire
coast
golden
cap
with
its
bright
crest
of
yellow
sand
and
the
dark
blue
lias
cliff
of
black
ven
when
i
came
early
down
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
rising
opposite
shining
into
the
room
over
a
calm
sea
along
an
avenue
of
light
by
degrees
as
it
rose
the
whole
sea
was
gilt
with
light
and
the
hills
bathed
in
a
violet
mist
by
all
color
had
faded
from
the
sea
it
was
like
silver
passing
on
each
side
into
gray
the
sky
was
blue
flecked
with
fleecy
clouds
while
on
the
gentler
slopes
of
the
coast
opposite
fields
and
woods
and
quarries
and
lines
of
stratification
begin
to
show
themselves
though
the
cliffs
are
still
in
shadow
and
the
more
distant
headlands
still
a
mere
succession
of
ghosts
each
one
fainter
than
the
one
before
it
as
the
morning
advances
the
sea
becomes
blue
the
dark
woods
green
meadows
and
golden
cornfields
of
the
opposite
coast
more
distinct
and
the
details
of
the
cliffs
come
gradually
into
view
and
with
dark
sails
begin
to
appear
gradually
the
sun
rises
higher
a
yellow
line
of
shore
appears
under
the
opposite
cliffs
and
the
sea
changes
its
color
mapping
itself
out
as
it
were
the
shallower
parts
turquoise
blue
almost
green
the
deeper
ones
deep
violet
this
does
not
last
long
a
thunderstorm
comes
up
the
wind
mutters
overhead
the
rain
patters
on
the
leaves
the
coast
opposite
seems
to
shrink
into
itself
as
if
it
would
fly
from
the
storm
the
sea
grows
dark
and
rough
and
white
horses
appear
here
and
there
but
the
storm
is
soon
over
the
clouds
break
the
rain
stops
the
sun
shines
once
more
the
hills
opposite
come
out
again
they
are
divided
now
not
only
into
fields
and
woods
but
into
sunshine
and
shadow
the
sky
clears
and
as
the
sun
begins
to
descend
westwards
the
sea
becomes
one
beautiful
clear
uniform
azure
changing
again
soon
to
pale
blue
in
front
and
dark
violet
beyond
and
once
more
as
clouds
begin
to
gather
again
into
an
archipelago
of
bright
blue
sea
and
deep
islands
of
ultramarine
as
the
sun
travels
westward
the
opposite
hills
change
again
they
scarcely
seem
like
the
same
country
what
was
in
sun
is
now
in
shade
and
what
was
in
shade
now
lies
bright
in
the
sunshine
the
sea
once
more
becomes
a
uniform
solid
blue
only
flecked
in
places
by
scuds
of
wind
and
becoming
paler
towards
evening
as
the
sun
sinks
the
cliffs
which
catch
his
setting
rays
losing
their
deep
color
and
in
some
places
looking
almost
as
white
as
chalk
while
at
sunset
they
light
up
again
for
a
moment
with
a
golden
glow
the
sea
at
the
same
time
sinking
to
a
cold
gray
but
soon
the
hills
grow
cold
too
golden
cap
holding
out
bravely
to
the
last
and
the
shades
of
evening
settle
over
cliff
and
wood
cornfield
and
meadow
these
are
but
a
part
and
a
very
small
part
of
the
changes
of
a
single
day
and
scarce
any
two
days
are
alike
at
times
a
covers
everything
again
the
sea
which
sleeps
so
peacefully
sometimes
rages
and
the
very
existence
of
the
bay
itself
bears
witness
to
its
force
the
night
again
varies
like
the
day
sometimes
shrouded
by
a
canopy
of
darkness
sometimes
lit
up
by
millions
of
brilliant
worlds
sometimes
bathed
in
the
light
of
a
moon
which
never
retains
the
same
form
for
two
nights
together
if
lakes
are
less
grand
than
the
sea
they
are
in
some
respects
even
more
lovely
the
seashore
is
comparatively
bare
the
banks
of
lakes
are
often
richly
clothed
with
vegetation
which
comes
close
down
to
the
water
edge
sometimes
hanging
even
into
the
water
itself
they
are
often
studded
with
islands
they
are
sometimes
fringed
with
green
meadows
sometimes
bounded
by
rocky
promontories
rising
directly
from
comparatively
deep
water
while
the
calm
bright
surface
is
often
fretted
by
a
delicate
pattern
of
interlacing
ripples
or
reflects
a
second
softened
and
inverted
landscape
to
water
again
we
owe
the
marvellous
spectacle
of
the
rainbow
god
bow
in
the
clouds
it
is
indeed
truly
a
heavenly
messenger
and
so
unlike
anything
else
that
it
scarcely
seems
to
belong
to
this
world
many
things
are
colored
but
the
rainbow
seems
to
be
color
itself
first
the
flaming
red
sprang
vivid
forth
the
tawny
orange
next
and
next
delicious
yellow
by
whose
side
fell
the
kind
beams
of
green
then
the
pure
blue
that
swells
autumnal
skies
ethereal
play
and
then
of
sadder
hue
emerged
the
deeper
indigo
as
when
the
evening
droops
with
frost
while
the
last
gleamings
of
refracted
light
died
in
the
fainting
violet
away
we
do
not
i
think
sufficiently
realize
how
wonderful
is
the
blessing
of
color
it
would
have
been
possible
it
would
even
seem
more
probable
that
though
light
might
have
enabled
us
to
perceive
objects
this
could
only
have
been
by
shade
and
form
how
we
perceive
color
it
is
very
difficult
to
comprehend
and
yet
when
we
speak
of
beauty
among
the
ideas
which
come
to
us
most
naturally
are
those
of
birds
and
butterflies
flowers
and
shells
precious
stones
skies
and
rainbows
our
minds
might
have
been
constituted
exactly
as
they
are
we
might
have
been
capable
of
comprehending
the
highest
and
sublimest
truths
and
yet
but
for
a
small
organ
in
the
head
the
world
of
sound
would
have
been
shut
out
from
us
we
should
have
lost
the
sounds
of
nature
the
charms
of
music
the
conversation
of
friends
and
have
been
condemned
to
perpetual
silence
and
yet
a
slight
alteration
in
the
retina
which
is
not
thicker
than
a
sheet
of
paper
not
larger
than
a
finger
nail
and
the
glorious
spectacle
of
this
beautiful
world
the
exquisite
variety
of
form
the
glory
and
play
of
color
the
variety
of
scenery
of
woods
and
fields
and
lakes
and
hills
seas
and
mountains
the
glory
of
the
sky
alike
by
day
and
night
would
all
have
been
lost
to
us
mountains
again
seem
to
have
been
built
for
the
human
race
as
at
once
their
schools
and
cathedrals
full
of
treasures
of
illuminated
manuscript
for
the
scholar
kindly
in
simple
lessons
for
the
worker
quiet
in
pale
cloisters
for
the
thinker
glorious
in
holiness
for
the
worshipper
and
of
these
great
cathedrals
of
the
earth
with
their
gates
of
rock
pavements
of
cloud
choirs
of
stream
and
stone
altars
of
snow
and
vaults
of
purple
traversed
by
the
continual
stars
all
these
beauties
are
comprised
in
tennyson
exquisite
description
of
oenone
vale
the
city
flowers
trees
river
and
mountains
there
is
a

when
we

from

who
has
not

felt
the

of
the

not
watched
a

floating
upward
as

on

yet
if
in
our
moments
of
utter
idleness
and
insipidity
we
turn
to
the

as
a
last
resource
which
of
its
phenomena
do
we
speak
of

says
it
has
been
wet
and
another
it
has
been

and
another

has

who
among

whole
chattering
crowd
can
tell
me
of
the
forms
and
the
precipices
of
the
chain
of
tall
white
mountains
that
girded
the
horizon
at
noon
yesterday
who
saw
the
narrow
sunbeam
that
came
out
of
the
south
and
smote
upon
their
summits
until
they
melted
and
mouldered
away
in
a
dust
of
blue
rain
who
saw
the
dance
of
the
dead
clouds
when
the
sunlight
left
them
last
night
and
the
west
wind
blew
them
before
it
like
withered
leaves
all
has
passed
unregretted
as
unseen
or
if
the
apathy
be
ever
shaken
off
even
for
an
instant
it
is
only
by
what
is
gross
or
what
is
extraordinary
and
yet
it
is
not
in
the
broad
and
fierce
manifestations
of
the
elemental
energies
not
in
the
clash
of
the
hail
nor
the
drift
of
the
whirlwind
that
the
highest
characters
of
the
sublime
are
developed
but
exquisitely
lovely
as
is
the
blue
arch
of
the
midday
sky
with
its
inexhaustible
variety
of
clouds
there
is
yet
a
light
which
the
eye
invariably
seeks
with
a
deeper
feeling
of
the
beautiful
the
light
of
the
declining
or
breaking
day
and
the
flakes
of
scarlet
cloud
burning
like
in
the
green
sky
of
the
horizon
the
evening
colors
indeed
soon
fade
away
but
as
night
comes
on
how
glorious
the
firmament
with
living
sapphires
hesperus
that
led
the
starry
host
rode
brightest
till
the
moon
rising
in
clouded
majesty
at
length
apparent
queen
unveiled
her
peerless
light
and
the
dark
her
silver
mantle
threw
we
generally
speak
of
a
beautiful
night
when
it
is
calm
and
clear
and
the
stars
shine
brightly
overhead
but
how
grand
also
are
the
wild
ways
of
nature
how
magnificent
when
the
lightning
flashes
between
gloom
and
glory
when
from
peak
to
peak
the
rattling
crags
among
leaps
the
live
thunder
in
the
words
of
ossian
ghosts
ride
in
the
tempest
sweet
is
their
voice
between
the
gusts
of
wind
their
songs
are
of
other
worlds
nor
are
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
the
heavens
limited
by
the
clouds
and
the
blue
sky
lovely
as
they
are
in
the
heavenly
bodies
we
have
before
us
the
perpetual
presence
of
the
sublime
they
are
so
immense
and
so
far
away
and
yet
on
soft
summer
nights
they
seem
leaning
down
to
whisper
in
the
ear
of
our
souls
a
man
can
hardly
lift
up
his
eyes
toward
the
heavens
says
seneca
without
wonder
and
veneration
to
see
so
many
millions
of
radiant
lights
and
to
observe
their
courses
and
revolutions
even
without
any
respect
to
the
common
good
of
the
universe
who
does
not
sympathize
with
the
feelings
of
dante
as
he
rose
from
his
visit
to
the
lower
regions
until
he
says
on
our
view
the
beautiful
lights
of
heaven
dawned
through
a
circular
opening
in
the
cave
thence
issuing
we
again
beheld
the
stars
as
we
watch
the
stars
at
night
they
seem
so
still
and
motionless
that
we
can
hardly
realize
that
all
the
time
they
are
rushing
on
with
a
velocity
far
far
exceeding
any
that
man
has
ever
accomplished
like
the
sands
of
the
sea
the
stars
of
heaven
have
ever
been
used
as
an
appropriate
symbol
of
number
and
we
know
that
there
are
some
many
no
doubt
with
planets
of
their
own
but
this
is
by
no
means
all
the
floor
of
heaven
is
not
only
thick
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
but
is
studded
also
with
extinct
stars
once
probably
as
brilliant
as
our
own
sun
but
now
dead
and
cold
as
helmholtz
tells
us
our
sun
itself
will
be
some
seventeen
millions
of
years
hence
then
again
there
are
the
comets
which
though
but
few
are
visible
to
us
at
once
are
even
more
numerous
than
the
stars
there
are
the
nebulae
and
the
countless
minor
bodies
circulating
in
space
and
occasionally
visible
as
meteors
nor
is
it
only
the
number
of
the
heavenly
bodies
which
is
so
overwhelming
their
magnitude
and
distances
are
almost
more
impressive
the
ocean
is
so
deep
and
broad
as
to
be
almost
infinite
and
indeed
in
so
far
as
our
imagination
is
the
limit
so
it
may
be
yet
what
is
the
ocean
compared
to
the
sky
our
globe
is
little
compared
to
the
giant
orbs
of
jupiter
and
saturn
which
again
sink
into
insignificance
by
the
side
of
the
sun
the
sun
itself
is
almost
as
nothing
compared
with
the
dimensions
of
the
solar
system
sirius
is
calculated
to
be
a
thousand
times
as
great
as
the
sun
and
a
million
times
as
far
away
the
solar
system
itself
travels
in
one
region
of
space
sailing
between
worlds
and
worlds
and
is
surrounded
by
many
other
systems
as
great
and
complex
as
itself
and
we
know
that
even
then
we
have
not
reached
the
limits
of
the
universe
itself
there
are
stars
so
distant
that
their
light
though
traveling
miles
in
a
second
yet
takes
years
to
reach
us
and
beyond
all
these
are
other
systems
of
stars
which
are
so
far
away
that
they
can
not
be
perceived
singly
but
even
in
our
most
powerful
telescopes
appear
only
as
minute
clouds
or
nebulae
it
is
indeed
but
a
feeble
expression
of
the
truth
to
say
that
the
infinities
revealed
to
us
by
science
the
infinitely
great
in
the
one
direction
and
the
infinitely
small
in
the
other
go
far
beyond
anything
which
had
occurred
to
the
unaided
imagination
of
man
and
are
not
only
a
source
of
pleasure
and
interest
but
seem
to
lift
us
out
of
the
petty
troubles
and
sorrows
of
life

of

chapter
ix
the
troubles
of
life
we
have
in
life
many
troubles
and
troubles
are
of
many
kinds
some
sorrows
alas
are
real
enough
especially
those
we
bring
on
ourselves
but
others
and
by
no
means
the
least
numerous
are
mere
ghosts
of
troubles
if
we
face
them
boldly
we
find
that
they
have
no
substance
or
reality
but
are
mere
creations
of
our
own
morbid
imagination
and
that
it
is
as
true
now
as
in
the
time
of
david
that
man
disquieteth
himself
in
a
vain
shadow
some
indeed
of
our
troubles
are
evils
but
not
real
while
others
are
real
but
not
evils
and
yet
into
how
unfathomable
a
gulf
the
mind
rushes
when
the
troubles
of
this
world
agitate
it
if
it
then
forget
its
own
light
which
is
eternal
joy
and
rush
into
the
outer
darkness
which
are
the
cares
of
this
world
as
the
mind
now
does
it
knows
nothing
else
but
lamentations
athens
said
epictetus
is
a
good
place
but
happiness
is
much
better
to
be
free
from
passions
free
from
disturbance
we
should
endeavor
to
maintain
ourselves
in
that
blessed
mood
in
which
the
burden
of
the
mystery
in
which
the
heavy
and
the
weary
weight
of
all
this
unintelligible
world
is
lightened
so
shall
we
fear
neither
the
exile
of
aristides
nor
the
prison
of
anaxagoras
nor
the
poverty
of
socrates
nor
the
condemnation
of
phocion
but
think
virtue
worthy
our
love
even
under
such
trials
we
should
then
be
to
a
great
extent
independent
of
external
circumstances
for
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
minds
innocent
and
quiet
take
that
for
a
hermitage
if
i
have
freedom
in
my
love
and
in
my
soul
am
free
angels
alone
that
soar
above
enjoy
such
liberty
happiness
indeed
depends
much
more
on
what
is
within
than
without
us
when
hamlet
says
the
world
is
a
goodly
prison
in
which
there
are
many
confines
wards
and
dungeons
denmark
being
one
of
the
worst
and
rosencrantz
differs
from
him
he
rejoins
wisely
why
then
is
none
to
you
for
there
is
nothing
either
good
or
bad
but
thinking
makes
it
so
to
me
it
is
a
prison
all
is
opinion
said
marcus
aurelius
that
which
does
not
make
a
man
worse
how
can
it
make
his
life
worse
but
death
certainly
and
life
honor
and
dishonor
pain
and
pleasure
all
these
things
happen
equally
to
good
men
and
bad
being
things
which
make
us
neither
better
nor
worse
the
greatest
evils
says
jeremy
taylor
are
from
within
us
and
from
ourselves
also
we
must
look
for
our
greatest
good
the
mind
says
milton
is
its
own
place
and
in
itself
can
make
a
heaven
of
hell
a
hell
of
heaven
milton
indeed
in
his
blindness
saw
more
beautiful
visions
and
beethoven
in
his
deafness
heard
more
heavenly
music
than
most
of
us
can
ever
hope
to
enjoy
we
are
all
apt
when
we
know
not
what
may
happen
to
fear
the
worst
when
we
know
the
full
extent
of
any
danger
it
is
half
over
hence
we
dread
ghosts
more
than
robbers
not
only
without
reason
but
against
reason
for
even
if
ghosts
existed
how
could
they
hurt
us
and
in
ghost
stories
few
even
those
who
say
that
they
have
seen
a
ghost
ever
profess
or
pretend
to
have
felt
one
milton
in
his
description
of
death
dwells
on
this
characteristic
of
obscurity
the
other
shape
if
shape
it
might
be
call
that
shape
had
none
distinguishable
in
member
joint
or
limb
or
substance
might
be
call
that
shadow
seem
for
each
seem
either
black
he
stood
as
night
fierce
as
ten
furies
terrible
as
hell
and
shook
a
deadly
dart
what
seem
his
head
the
likeness
of
a
kingly
crown
had
on
the
effect
of
darkness
and
night
in
enhancing
terrors
is
dwelt
on
in
one
of
the
sublimest
passages
in
job
in
thoughts
from
the
visions
of
the
night
when
deep
sleep
falleth
on
men
fear
came
upon
me
and
trembling
which
made
all
my
bones
to
shake
then
a
spirit
passed
before
my
face
the
hair
of
my
flesh
stood
up
it
stood
still
an
image
was
before
mine
eyes
there
was
silence
and
i
heard
a
voice
saying
shall
mortal
man
be
more
just
than
god
thus
was
the
terror
turned
into
a
lesson
of
comfort
and
of
mercy
we
often
magnify
troubles
and
difficulties
and
look
at
them
till
they
seem
much
greater
than
they
really
are
dangers
are
no
more
light
if
they
once
seem
light
and
more
dangers
have
deceived
men
than
forced
them
nay
it
were
better
to
meet
some
dangers
half
way
though
they
come
nothing
near
than
to
keep
too
long
a
watch
upon
their
approaches
for
if
a
man
watch
too
long
it
is
odds
he
will
fall
asleep
foresight
is
very
wise
but
foresorrow
is
very
foolish
and
castles
are
at
any
rate
better
than
dungeons
in
the
air
some
of
our
troubles
no
doubt
are
real
enough
but
yet
are
not
evils
it
happens
unfortunately
too
often
that
by
some
false
step
intentional
or
unintentional
we
have
missed
the
right
road
and
gone
wrong
can
we
then
retrace
our
steps
can
we
recover
what
is
lost
this
may
be
done
it
is
too
gloomy
a
view
to
affirm
that
a
word
too
much
or
a
kiss
too
long
and
the
world
is
never
the
same
again
there
are
two
noble
sayings
of
socrates
that
to
do
evil
is
more
to
be
avoided
than
to
suffer
it
and
that
when
a
man
has
done
evil
it
is
better
for
him
to
be
punished
than
to
be
unpunished
we
generally
speak
of
selfishness
as
a
fault
and
as
if
it
interfered
with
the
general
happiness
but
this
is
not
altogether
correct
the
pity
is
that
so
many
people
are
foolishly
selfish
that
they
pursue
a
course
of
action
which
neither
makes
themselves
nor
any
one
else
happy
every
man
says
goethe
ought
to
begin
with
himself
and
make
his
own
happiness
first
from
which
the
happiness
of
the
whole
world
would
at
last
unquestionably
follow
it
is
easy
to
say
that
this
is
too
broadly
stated
and
of
course
exceptions
might
be
pointed
out
but
if
every
one
would
avoid
excess
and
take
care
of
his
own
health
would
keep
himself
strong
and
cheerful
would
make
his
home
happy
and
give
no
cause
for
the
petty
vexations
which
embitter
domestic
life
would
attend
to
his
own
affairs
and
keep
himself
sober
and
solvent
would
in
the
words
of
the
chinese
proverb
sweep
away
the
snow
from
before
his
own
door
and
never
mind
the
frost
upon
his
neighbor
tiles
though
it
might
not
be
the
noblest
course
of
conduct
still
how
well
it
would
be
for
their
family
relations
and
friends
but
unfortunately
look
round
the
habitable
world
how
few
know
their
own
good
or
knowing
it
pursue
it
would
be
a
great
thing
if
people
could
be
brought
to
realize
that
they
can
never
add
to
the
sum
of
their
happiness
by
doing
wrong
in
the
case
of
children
indeed
we
recognize
this
we
perceive
that
a
spoilt
child
is
not
a
happy
one
that
it
would
have
been
far
better
for
him
to
have
been
punished
at
first
and
thus
saved
from
greater
suffering
in
after
life
it
is
a
beautiful
idea
that
every
man
has
with
him
a
guardian
angel
and
it
is
true
too
for
conscience
is
ever
on
the
watch
ever
ready
to
warn
us
of
danger
we
often
feel
disposed
to
complain
and
yet
it
is
most
ungrateful
for
who
would
lose
though
full
of
pain
this
intellectual
being
those
thoughts
that
wander
through
eternity
to
perish
rather
swallowed
up
and
lost
in
the
wide
womb
of
uncreated
thought
but
perhaps
it
will
be
said
that
we
are
sent
here
in
preparation
for
another
and
a
better
world
well
then
why
should
we
complain
of
what
is
but
a
preparation
for
future
happiness
we
ought
to
count
each
affliction
whether
light
or
grave
god
messenger
sent
down
to
thee
do
thou
with
courtesy
receive
him
rise
and
bow
and
ere
his
shadow
pass
thy
threshold
crave
permission
first
his
heavenly
feet
to
lave
then
lay
before
him
all
thou
hast
allow
no
cloud
of
passion
to
usurp
thy
brow
or
mar
thy
hospitality
no
wave
of
mortal
tumult
to
obliterate
the
soul
marmoreal
calmness
grief
shall
be
like
joy
majestic
equable
sedate
confirming
cleansing
raising
making
free
strong
to
consume
small
troubles
to
commend
great
thoughts
grave
thoughts
thoughts
lasting
to
the
end
some
persons
are
like
the
waters
of
siloam
and
require
to
be
troubled
before
they
can
exercise
their
virtue
we
shall
get
more
contentedness
says
plutarch
from
the
presence
of
all
these
blessings
if
we
fancy
them
as
absent
and
remember
from
time
to
time
how
people
when
ill
yearn
for
health
and
people
in
war
for
peace
and
strangers
and
unknown
in
a
great
city
for
reputation
and
friends
and
how
painful
it
is
to
be
deprived
of
all
these
when
one
has
once
had
them
for
then
each
of
these
blessings
will
not
appear
to
us
only
great
and
valuable
when
it
is
lost
and
of
no
value
when
we
have
it
and
yet
it
makes
much
for
contentedness
of
mind
to
look
for
the
most
part
at
home
and
to
our
own
condition
or
if
not
to
look
at
the
case
of
people
worse
off
than
ourselves
and
not
as
people
do
to
compare
ourselves
with
those
who
are
better
off
but
you
will
find
others
chians
or
galatians
or
bithynians
not
content
with
the
share
of
glory
or
power
they
have
among
their
but
weeping
because
they
do
not
wear
shoes
or
if
they
have
them
that
they
can
not
be
praetors
of
rome
or
if
they
get
that
office
that
they
are
not
consuls
or
if
they
are
consuls
that
they
are
only
proclaimed
second
and
not
first
whenever
then
you
admire
any
one
carried
by
in
his
litter
as
a
greater
man
than
yourself
lower
your
eyes
and
look
at
those
that
bear
the

who
was
dressing
with

display
for

not
a
good
man
consider

a

seeing
then
that
life
is
the
most
complete
initiation
into
all
these
things
it
ought
to
be
full
of
ease
of
mind
and
joy
and
if
properly
understood
would
enable
us
to
acquiesce
in
the
present
without
repining
to
remember
the
past
with
thankfulness
and
to
meet
the
future

chapter
x
labor
and
rest
among
the
troubles
of
life
i
do
not
of
course
reckon
the
necessity
of
labor
work
indeed
and
hard
work
if
only
it
is
in
moderation
is
in
itself
a
rich
source
of
happiness
we
all
know
how
quickly
time
passes
when
we
are
well
employed
while
the
moments
hang
heavily
on
the
hands
of
the
idle
occupation
drives
away
care
and
all
the
small
troubles
of
life
the
busy
man
has
no
time
to
brood
or
to
fret
from
toil
he
wins
his
spirits
light
from
busy
day
the
peaceful
night
rich
from
the
very
want
of
wealth
in
heaven
best
treasures
peace
and
health
this
applies
especially
to
the
labor
of
the
field
and
the
workshop
humble
it
may
be
but
if
it
does
not
dazzle
with
the
promise
of
fame
it
gives
the
satisfaction
of
duty
fulfilled
and
the
inestimable
blessing
of
health
as
emerson
reminds
those
entering
life
the
angels
that
live
with
them
and
are
weaving
laurels
of
life
for
their
youthful
brows
are
toil
and
truth
and
mutual
faith
labor
was
truly
said
by
the
ancients
to
be
the
price
which
the
gods
set
upon
everything
worth
having
we
all
admit
though
we
often
forget
the
marvellous
power
of
perseverance
and
yet
all
nature
down
to
spider
is
continually
impressing
this
lesson
on
us
hard
writing
it
has
been
said
makes
easy
reading
plato
is
said
to
have
rewritten
the
first
page
of
the
thirteen
times
and
carlo
maratti
we
are
told
sketched
the
head
of
antinoüs
three
hundred
times
before
he
wrought
it
to
his
satisfaction
it
is
better
to
wear
out
than
to
rust
out
and
there
is
a
dust
which
settles
on
the
heart
as
well
as
that
which
rests
upon
the
ledge
but
though
labor
is
good
for
man
it
may
be
and
unfortunately
often
is
carried
to
excess
many
are
wearily
asking
themselves
ah
why
should
life
all
labor
be
there
is
a
time
for
all
things
says
solomon
a
time
to
work
and
a
time
to
play
we
shall
work
all
the
better
for
reasonable
change
and
one
reward
of
work
is
to
secure
leisure
it
is
a
good
saying
that
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
but
while
it
is
all
very
well
to
wish
wishes
must
not
take
the
place
of
work
in
whatever
sphere
his
duty
lies
every
man
must
rely
mainly
on
himself
others
can
help
us
but
we
must
make
ourselves
no
one
else
can
see
for
us
to
profit
by
our
advantages
we
must
learn
to
use
for
ourselves
the
dark
lantern
of
the
spirit
which
none
can
see
by
but
he
who
bears
it
it
is
hardly
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
honest
work
is
never
thrown
away
if
we
do
not
find
the
imaginary
treasure
at
any
rate
we
enrich
the
vineyard
work
says
nature
to
man
in
every
hour
paid
or
unpaid
see
only
that
thou
work
and
thou
canst
not
escape
the
reward
whether
thy
work
be
fine
or
coarse
planting
corn
or
writing
epics
so
only
it
be
honest
work
done
to
thine
own
approbation
it
shall
earn
a
reward
to
the
senses
as
well
as
to
the
thought
no
matter
how
often
defeated
you
are
born
to
victory
the
reward
of
a
thing
well
done
is
to
have
done
it
nor
can
any
work
however
persevering
or
any
success
however
great
exhaust
the
prizes
of
life
the
most
studious
the
most
successful
must
recognize
that
there
yet
remain
so
much
to
do
that
is
not
begun
so
much
to
hope
for
that
we
can
not
see
so
much
to
win
so
many
things
to
be
at
the
present
time
though
there
may
be
some
special
drawbacks
still
we
come
to
our
work
with
many
advantages
which
were
not
enjoyed
in
olden
times
we
live
in
much
greater
security
ourselves
and
are
less
liable
to
have
the
fruits
of
our
labor
torn
violently
from
us
in
olden
times
the
difficulties
of
study
were
far
greater
than
they
are
now
books
were
expensive
and
cumbersome
in
many
cases
moreover
chained
to
the
desks
on
which
they
were
kept
the
greatest
scholars
have
often
been
very
poor
erasmus
used
to
read
by
moonlight
because
he
could
not
afford
a
candle
and
begged
a
penny
not
for
the
love
of
charity
but
for
the
love
of
learning
want
of
time
is
no
excuse
for
idleness
our
life
says
jeremy
taylor
is
too
short
to
serve
the
ambition
of
a
haughty
prince
or
a
usurping
rebel
too
little
time
to
purchase
great
wealth
to
satisfy
the
pride
of
a
vainglorious
fool
to
trample
upon
all
the
enemies
of
our
just
or
unjust
interest
but
for
the
obtaining
virtue
for
the
purchase
of
sobriety
and
modesty
for
the
actions
of
religion
god
gives
us
time
sufficient
if
we
make
the
outgoings
of
the
morning
and
evening
that
is
our
infancy
and
old
age
to
be
taken
into
the
computations
of
a
man
work
is
so
much
a
necessity
of
existence
that
it
is
less
a
question
whether
than
how
we
shall
work
an
old
proverb
tells
us
that
the
devil
finds
work
for
those
who
do
not
make
it
for
themselves
if
we
englishmen
have
succeeded
as
a
race
it
has
been
due
in
no
small
measure
to
the
fact
that
we
have
worked
hard
not
only
so
but
we
have
induced
the
forces
of
nature
to
work
for
us
steam
says
emerson
is
almost
an
englishman
the
power
of
work
has
especially
characterized
our
greatest
men
cecil
said
of
sir
raleigh
that
he
could
toil
terribly
we
are
most
of
us
proud
of
belonging
to
the
greatest
empire
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
may
be
said
of
us
with
especial
truth
in
wordsworth
words
that
the
world
is
too
much
with
us
late
and
soon
getting
and
spending
we
lay
waste
our
powers
yes
but
what
world
the
world
will
be
with
us
sure
enough
and
whether
we
please
or
not
but
what
sort
of
world
it
will
be
for
us
will
depend
greatly
on
ourselves
we
are
told
to
pray
not
to
be
taken
out
of
the
world
but
to
be
kept
from
the
evil
there
are
various
ways
of
working
quickness
may
be
good
but
haste
is
bad
wie

last
like
a
star
without
haste
without
rest
let
every
one
fulfil
his
own
hest
newton
is
reported
to
have
described
as
his
mode
of
working
that
i
keep
the
subject
constantly
before
me
and
wait
till
the
first
dawnings
open
slowly
by
little
and
little
into
a
full
and
clear
light
the
secret
of
genius
says
emerson
is
to
suffer
no
fiction
to
exist
for
us
to
realize
all
that
we
know
in
the
high
refinement
of
modern
life
in
arts
in
sciences
in
books
in
men
to
exact
good
faith
reality
and
a
purpose
and
first
last
midst
and
without
end
to
honor
every
truth
by
use
lastly
work
secures
the
rich
reward
of
rest
we
must
rest
to
be
able
to
work
well
and
work
to
be
able
to
enjoy
rest
we
must
no
doubt
beware
that
our
rest
become
not
the
rest
of
stones
which
so
long
as
they
are
and
maintain
their
majesty
but
when
the
stream
is
silent
and
the
storm
past
suffer
the
grass
to
cover
them
and
the
lichen
to
feed
on
them
and
are
ploughed
down
into
the
dust
the
rest
which
is
glorious
is
of
the
chamois
couched
breathless
in
its
granite
bed
not
of
the
stalled
ox
over
his
fodder
when
we
have
done
our
best
we
may
wait
the
result
without
anxiety
what
hinders
a
man
who
has
clearly
comprehended
these
things
from
living
with
a
light
heart
and
bearing
easily
the
reins
quietly
expecting
everything
which
can
happen
and
enduring
that
which
has
already
happened
would
you
have
me
to
bear
poverty
come
and
you
will
know
what
poverty
is
when
it
has
found
one
who
can
act
well
the
part
of
a
poor
man
would
you
have
me
to
possess
power
let
me
have
the
power
and
also
the
trouble
of
it

wherever
i
shall

the
final
and
eternal
rest
very
touching
is
the
appeal
of
ashmanezer
to
be
left
in
peace
which
was
engraved
on
his
sarcophagus
at
sidon
now
in
paris
in
the
month
of

year
of

of
days
the
whilom
great
is
dumb
the
son
of
gods
is
dead
and
i
rest
in
this
grave
even
in
this
tomb
in
the
place
which
i
have
built
my
adjuration
to
all
the
ruling
powers
and
all
men
let
no
one
open
this
nor
search
for
treasure
for
there
is
no
treasure
with
us
and
let
him
not
bear
away
the
couch
of
my
rest
and
not
trouble
us
in
this
by
disturbing
the
couch
of
my
slumbers
for
all
men
who
should
open
the
tomb
of
my
rest
or
any
man
who
should
carry
away
the
couch
of
my
rest
or
any
one
who
trouble
me
on
this
couch
unto
them
there
shall
be
no
rest
with
the
departed
they
shall
not
be
buried
in
a
grave
and
there
shall
be
to
them
neither
son
nor
seed
there
shall
be
to
them
neither
root
below
nor
fruit
above
nor
honor
among
the
living
under
the
sun
the
idle
man
does
not
know
what
it
is
to
rest
hard
work
moreover
tends
not
only
to
give
us
rest
for
the
body
but
what
is
even
more
important
peace
to
the
mind
if
we
have
done
our
best
to
do
and
to
be
we
can
rest

peace
the

delight
for
when

the
soul
wakes
in
youth
as
is
right
enough
the
idea
of
exertion
and
of

is
inspiriting
and
delightful
but
as
years
advance
the
hope
and
prospect
of

gain
ground

when

would

quite
out

place
here
to
enter
into
any
discussion
of
theological
problems
or
to
advocate
any
particular
doctrines
nevertheless
i
could
not
omit
what
is
to
most
so
great
a
comfort
and
support
in
sorrow
and
suffering
and
a
source
of
the
purest
happiness
we
commonly
however
bring
together
under
this
term
two
things
which
are
yet
very
different
the
religion
of
the
heart
and
that
of
the
head
the
first
deals
with
conduct
and
the
duties
of
man
the
second
with
the
nature
of
the
supernatural
and
the
future
of
the
soul
being
in
fact
a
branch
of
knowledge
religion
should
be
a
strength
guide
and
comfort
not
a
source
of
intellectual
anxiety
or
angry
argument
to
persecute
for
religion
sake
implies
belief
in
a
jealous
cruel
and
unjust
deity
if
we
have
done
our
best
to
arrive
at
the
truth
to
torment
oneself
about
the
result
is
to
doubt
the
goodness
of
god
and
in
the
words
of
bacon
to
bring
down
the
holy
ghost
instead
of
the
likeness
of
a
dove
in
the
shape
of
a
raven
the
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
giveth
life
and
the
first
duty
of

is
to
form
the
highest
possible
conception
of
god
many
a
man
however
and
still
more
many
a
woman
render
themselves
miserable
on
entering
life
by
theological
doubts
and
difficulties
these
have
reference
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
not
to
what
we
should
do
but
to
what
we
should
think
as
regards
action
conscience
is
generally
a
ready
guide
to
follow
it
is
the
real
difficulty
theology
on
the
other
hand
is
a
most
abstruse
science
but
as
long
as
we
honestly
wish
to
arrive
at
truth
we
need
not
fear
that
we
shall
be
punished
for
unintentional
error
for
what
says
micah
doth
the
lord
require
of
thee
but
to
do
justly
to
love
mercy
and
to
walk
humbly
with
thy
god
there
is
very
little
theology
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
or
indeed
in
any
part
of
the
gospels
and
the
differences
which
keep
us
apart
have
their
origin
rather
in
the
study
than
the
church
religion
was
intended
to
bring
peace
on
earth
and
goodwill
toward
men
and
whatever
tends
to
hatred
and
persecution
however
correct
in
the
letter
must
be
utterly
wrong
in
the
spirit

much
misery
would
have
been
saved
to
europe

christians
had
been
satisfied

the
sermon

the
mount
bokhara
is
said
to
have
contained
more
than
three
hundred
colleges
all
occupied
with
theology
but
ignorant
of
everything
else
and
it
was
probably
one
of
the
most
bigoted
and
uncharitable
cities
in
the
world
knowledge
puffeth
up

charity

we
must
not
forget
that
he

who
loveth
best
all
things
both
great
and
small
theologians
too
often
appear
to
agree
that
the
awful
shadow
of
some
unseen
power
floats
though
unseen
among
us
and
in
the
days
of
the
inquisition
many
must
have
sighed
for
the
cheerful
religion
of
the
greeks

they
could

human
race
into
nations
from
among
all
their
dogmas
i
have
selected
one
divine
love
and
again
he
needs
no
other
rosary
whose
thread
of
life
is
strung
with
the
beads
of
love
and
thought
there
is
more
true
christianity
in
some
pagan
philosophers
than
in
certain
christian
theologians
take
for
instance
plato
marcus
aurelius
epictetus
and
plutarch
now
i
callicles
says
socrates
am
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
these
things
and
i
consider
how
i
shall
present
my
soul
whole
and
undefiled
before
the
judge
in
that
day
renouncing
the
honors
at
which
the
world
aims
i
desire
only
to
know
the
truth
and
to
live
as
well
as
i
can
and
when
the
time
comes
to
die
and
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
i
exhort
all
other
men
to
do
the
same
and
in
return
for
your
exhortation
of
me
i
exhort
you
also
to
take
part
in
the
great
combat
which
is
the
combat
of
life
and
greater
than
every
other
earthly
conflict
as
to
piety
toward
the
gods
says
epictetus
you
must
know
that
this
is
the
chief
thing
to
have
right
opinions
about
them
to
think
that
they
exist
and
that
they
administer
the
all
well
and
justly
and
you
must
fix
yourself
in
this
principle
duty
to
obey
them
and
to
yield
to
them
in
everything
which
happens
and
voluntarily
to
follow
it
as
being
accomplished
by
the
wisest
intelligence
do
not
act
says
marcus
aurelius
as
if
thou
wert
going
to
live
ten
thousand
years
death
hangs
over
thee
while
thou
livest
while
it
is
in
thy
power
be
good
since
it
is
possible
that
thou
mayest
depart
from
life
this
very
moment
regulate
every
act
and
thought
accordingly
but
to
go
away
from
among
men
if
there
be
gods
is
not
a
thing
to
be
afraid
of
for
the
gods
will
not
involve
thee
in
evil
but
if
indeed
they
do
not
exist
or
if
they
have
no
concern
about
human
affairs
what
is
it
to
me
to
live
in
a
universe
devoid
of
gods
or
devoid
of
providence
but
in
truth
they
do
exist
and
they
do
care
for
human
things
and
they
have
put
all
the
means
in
man
power
to
enable
him
not
to
fall
into
real
evils
and
as
for
the
rest
if
there
was
anything
evil
they
would
have
provided
for
this
also
that
it
should
be
altogether
in
a
man
power
not
to
fall
into
it
and
plutarch
the
godhead
is
not
blessed
by
reason
of
his
silver
and
gold
nor
yet
almighty
through
his
thunder
and
lightnings
but
on
account
of
knowledge
and
intelligence
it
is
no
doubt
very
difficult
to
arrive
at
the
exact
teaching
of
eastern
moralists
but
the
same
spirit
runs
through
oriental
literature
for
instance
in
the
when
the
wicked
prince
wishes
vita
to
murder
the
heroine
and
says
that
no
one
would
see
him
vita
declares
all
nature
would
behold
the
crime
the
genii
of
the
grove
the
sun
the
moon
the
winds
the
vault
of
heaven
the
earth
the
mighty
yama
who
judges
the
dead
and
the
conscious
soul
take
even
the
most
extreme
type
of
difference
is
the
man
says
plutarch
a
criminal
who
holds
there
are
no
gods
and
is
not
he
that
holds
them
to
be
such
as
the
superstitious
believe
them
is
he
not
possessed
with
notions
infinitely
more
atrocious
i
for
my
part
would
much
rather
have
men
say
of
me
that
there
never
was
a
plutarch
at
all
nor
is
now
than
to
say
that
plutarch
is
a
man
inconstant
fickle
easily
moved
to
anger
revengeful
for
trifling
provocations
vexed
at
small
things
there
is
no
doubt
a
tone
of
doubting
sadness
in
roman
moralists
as
in
hadrian
dying
lines
to
his
soul

blandula
hospes

qua

the
same
spirit
indeed
is
expressed
in
the
epitaph
on
the

of
the

of
buckingham
in

many
things
have
been
mistaken
for
religion
selfishness
especially
but
also
fear
hope
love
of
music
of
art
of
pomp
scruples
often
take
the
place
of
love
and
the
glory
of
heaven
is
sometimes
made
to
depend
upon
precious
stones
and
jewelry
many
as
has
been
well
said
run
after
christ
not
for
the
miracles
but
for
the
loaves
in
many
cases
religious
differences
are
mainly
verbal
there
is
an
eastern
tale
of
four
men
an
arab
a
persian
a
turk
and
a
greek
who
agreed
to
club
together
for
an
evening
meal
but
when
they
had
done
so
they
quarrelled
as
to
what
it
should
be
the
turk
proposed
azum
the
arab
aneb
the
persian
anghur
while
the
greek
insisted
on
stapylion
while
they
were
disputing
before
their
eyes
did
pass
laden
with
grapes
a
gardener
ass
sprang
to
his
feet
each
man
and
showed
with
eager
hand
that
purple
load
azum
said
the
turk
and
anghur
the
persian
should
be
better
aneb
aneb
is
the
arab
cried
the
greek
said
is
my
stapylion
then
they
bought
their
grapes
in
peace
hence
be
ye
taught
it
is
said
that
on
one
occasion
when
dean
stanley
had
been
explaining
his
views
to
lord
beaconsfield
the
latter
replied
ah
dean
that
is
all
very
well
but
you
must
remember
no
dogmas
no
deans
to
lose
such
deans
as
stanley
would
indeed
be
a
great
misfortune
but
does
it
follow
religions
far
from
being
really
built
on
dogmas
are
too
often
weighed
down
and
crushed
by
them
no
one
can
doubt
that
stanley
has
done
much
to
strengthen
the
church
of
england
we
may
not
always
agree
with
spinoza
but
is
he
not
right
when
he
says
the
first
precept
of
the
divine
law
therefore
indeed
its
sum
and
substance
is
to
love
god
unconditionally
as
the
supreme
good
unconditionally
i
say
and
not
from
any
love
or
fear
of
aught
besides
and
again
that
the
very
essence
of
religion
is
belief
in
a
supreme
being
who
delights
in
justice
and
mercy
whom
all
who
would
be
saved
are
bound
to
obey
and
whose
worship
consists
in
the
practice
of
justice
and
charity
toward
our
neighbors
doubt
is
of
two
natures
and
we
often
confuse
a
wise
suspension
of
judgment
with
the
weakness
of
hesitation
to
profess
an
opinion
for
which
we
have
no
sufficient
reason
is
clearly
illogical
but
when
it
is
necessary
to
act
we
must
do
so
on
the
best
evidence
available
however
slight
that
may
be
herein
lies
the
importance
of
common
sense
the
instincts
of
a
general
the
sagacity
of
a
statesman
pyrrho
the
recognized
representative
of
doubt
was
often
wise
in
suspending
his
judgment
however
foolish
in
hesitating
to
act
and
in
apologizing
when
after
resisting
all
the
arguments
of
philosophy
an
angry
dog
drove
him
from
his
position
collect
from
the
bible
all
that
christ
thought
necessary
for
his
disciples
and
how
little
dogma
there
is
pure
religion
and
undefiled
is
this
to
visit
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction
and
to
keep
himself
unspotted
from
the
world
by
this
shall
all
men
know
that
ye
are
my
disciples
if
ye
have
love
one
to
another
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
one
lesson
which
little
children
have
to
teach
us
is
that
religion
is
an
affair
of
the
heart
and
not
of
the
mind
only
why
should
we
expect
religion
to
solve
questions
with
reference
to
the
origin
and
destiny
of
the
universe
we
do
not
expect
the
most
elaborate
treatise
to
tell
us
the
origin
of
electricity
or
of
heat
natural
history
throws
no
light
on
the
origin
of
life
has
biology
ever
professed
to
explain
existence
simonides
was
asked
at
syracuse
by
hiero
who
or
what
god
was
when
he
requested
a
day
time
to
think
of
his
answer
on
subsequent
days
he
always
doubled
the
period
required
for
deliberation
and
when
hiero
inquired
the
reason
he
replied
that
the
longer
he
considered
the
subject
the
more
obscure
it
appeared
the
vedas
say
in
the
midst
of
the
sun
is
the
light
in
the
midst
of
light
is
truth
and
in
the
midst
of
truth
is
the
imperishable
being

the

is
not
a
place
for
study
or
speculation
few
but
can
sympathize
with
eugénie
de
guréin
in
her
tender
affection
for
the
little
chapel
at
cahuze

she
tells

she

at

he
beat
his
music
out
there
lies
more
faith
in
honest
doubt
believe
me
than
in
half
the
creeds
and
if
we
must
admit
that
many
points
are
still
and
probably
long
will
be
involved
in
obscurity
we
may
be
pardoned
if
we
indulge
ourselves
in
various
speculations
both
as
to
our
beginning
and
our
end
our
birth
is
but
a
sleep
and
a
forgetting
the
soul
that
rises
with
us
our
life
star
hath
had
elsewhere
its
setting
and
cometh
from
afar
not
in
entire
forgetfulness
and
not
in
utter
nakedness
but
trailing
clouds
of
glory
do
we
come
from
god
who
is
our
home
unfortunately
many
have
attempted
to
compound
for
wickedness
in
life
by
purity
of
belief
a
vain
and
fruitless
effort
to
do
right
is
the
sure
ladder
which
leads
up
to
heaven
though
the
true
faith
will
help
us
to
find
and
to
climb
it
it
is
my
duty
to
have
loved
the
highest
it
surely
was
my
profit
had
i
known
it
would
have
been
my
pleasure
had
i
seen
but
though
religious
truth
can
justify
no
bitterness
it
is
well
worth
any
amount
of
thought
and
study
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
supposed
to
depreciate
any
honest
effort
to
arrive
at
truth
or
to
undervalue
the
devotion
of
those
who
have
died
for
their
religion
but
surely
it
is
a
mistake
to
regard
martyrdom
as
a
merit
when
from
their
own
point
of
view
it
was
in
reality
a
privilege
let
every
man
be
persuaded
in
his
own
mind
truth
is
the
highest
thing
that
man
may
keep
to
arrive
at
truth
we
should
spare
ourselves
no
pain
but
certainly
inflict
none
on
others
we
may
be
sure
that
quarrels
will
never
advance
religion
and
that
to
persecute
is
no
way
to
convert
no
doubt
those
who
consider
that
all
who
do
not
agree
with
them
will
suffer
eternal
torments
seem
logically
justified
in
persecution
even
unto
death
such
a
course
if
carried
out
consistently
might
stamp
out
a
particular
sect
and
any
sufferings
which
could
be
inflicted
here
would
on
this
hypothesis
be
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
pains
of
hell
only
it
must
be
admitted
that
such
a
view
of
religion
is
incompatible
with
any
faith
in
the
goodness
of
god
and
seems
quite
irreconcilable
with
the
teaching
of
christ
moreover
the
inquisition
has
even
from
its
own
point
of
view
proved
generally
a
failure
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
is
the
seed
of
the
church
in
obedience
to
the
order
of
the
council
of
constance
the
remains
of
wickliffe
were
exhumed
and
burnt
to
ashes
and
these
cast
into
the
swift
a
neighboring
brook
running
hard
by
and
thus
this
brook
hath
conveyed
his
ashes
into
avon
avon
into
severn
severn
into
the
narrow
seas
they
into
the
main
ocean
and
thus
the
ashes
of
wickliffe
are
the
emblem
of
his
doctrine
which
now
is
dispersed
all
the
world
over
the
talmud
says
that
when
a
man
once
asked
shamai
to
teach
him
the
law
in
one
lesson
shamai
drove
him
away
in
anger
he
then
went
to
hillel
with
the
same
request
hillel
said
do
unto
others
as
you
would
have
others
do
unto
you
this
is
the
whole
law
the
rest
merely
commentaries
upon
it
the
religion
of
the
lower
races
is
almost
as
a
rule
one
of
terror
and
of
dread
their
deities
are
jealous
and
revengeful
cruel
merciless
and
selfish
hateful
and
yet
childish
they
require
to
be
propitiated
by
feasts
and
offerings
often
even
by
human
sacrifices
they
are
not
only
exacting
but
so
capricious
that
with
the
best
intentions
it
is
often
impossible
to
be
sure
of
pleasing
them
from
such
evil
beings
sorcerers
and
witches
derived
their
hellish
powers
no
one
was
safe
no
one
knew
where
danger
lurked
actions
apparently
the
most
trifling
might
be
fraught
with
serious
risk
objects
apparently
the
most
innocent
might
be
fatal
in
many
cases
there
are
supposed
to
be
deities
of
crime
of
misfortunes
of
disease
these
wicked
spirits
naturally
encourage
evil
rather
than
good
an
energetic
friend
of
mine
was
sent
to
a
district
in
india
where
smallpox
was
specially
prevalent
and
where
one
of
the
principal
temples
was
dedicated
to
the
goddess
of
that
disease
he
had
the
people
vaccinated
in
spite
of
some
opposition
and
the
disease
disappeared
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
natives
but
the
priests
of
the
deity
of
smallpox
were
not
disconcerted
only
they
deposed
the
image
of
their
discomfited
goddess
and
petitioned
my
friend
for
some
emblem
of
himself
which
they
might
install
in
her
stead
we
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
live
in
this
comparatively
enlightened
century
hardly
realize
how
our
ancestors
suffered
from
their
belief
in
the
existence
of
mysterious
and
malevolent
beings
how
their
life
was
embittered
and
overshadowed
by
these
awful
apprehensions
as
men
however
have
risen
in
civilization
their
religion
has
risen
with
them
they
have
by
degrees
acquired
higher
and
purer
conceptions
of
divine
power
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
realize
that
a
loving
and
merciful
father
would
not
resent
honest
error
not
even
perhaps
the
attribution
to
him
of
such
odious
injustice
yet
what
can
be
clearer
than
christ
teaching
on
this
point
he
impressed
it
over
and
over
again
on
his
disciples
the
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
giveth
life
if
says
ruskin
for
every
rebuke
that
we
titter
of
men
vices
we
put
forth
a
claim
upon
their
hearts
if
for
every
assertion
of
god
demands
from
them
we
should
substitute
a
display
of
his
kindness
to
them
if
side
by
side
with
every
warning
of
death
we
could
exhibit
proofs
and
promises
of
immortality
if
in
fine
instead
of
assuming
the
being
of
an
awful
deity
which
men
though
they
can
not
and
dare
not
deny
are
always
unwilling
sometimes
unable
to
conceive
we
were
to
show
them
a
near
visible
inevitable
out
deity
whose
presence
makes
the
earth
itself
a
heaven
i
think
there
would
be
fewer
deaf
children
sitting
in
the
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
those
who
doubt
whether
the
ultimate
truth
of
the
universe
can
be
expressed
in
human
words
or
whether
even
if
it
could
we
should
be
able
to
comprehend
it
undervalue
the
importance
of
religious
study
quite
the
contrary
their
doubts
arise
not
from
pride
but
from
humility
not
because
they
do
not
appreciate
divine
truth
but
on
the
contrary
they
doubt
whether
we
can
appreciate
it
sufficiently
and
are
sceptical
whether
the
infinite
can
be
reduced
to
the
finite
we
may
be
sure
that
whatever
may
be
right
about
religion
to
quarrel
over
it
must
be
wrong
let
others
wrangle
said
augustine
i
will
wonder
those
who
suspend
their
judgment
are
not
on
that
account
sceptics
and
it
is
often
those
who
think
they
know
most
who
are
especially
troubled
by
doubts
and
anxiety
it
was
wordsworth
who
wrote
great
god
i
had
rather
be
a
pagan
suckled
in
some
creed
outworn
so
might
i
standing
on
this
pleasant
lea
have
glimpses
that
would
make
me
less
forlorn
in
religion
as
with
children
at
night
it
is
darkness
and
ignorance
which
create
dread
light
and
love
cast
out
fear
in
looking
forward
to
the
future
we
may
fairly
hope
with
ruskin
that
the
charities
of
more
and
more
widely
extended
peace
are
preparing
the
way
for
a
christian
church
which
shall
depend
neither
on

its
continuance

on

its

the
hope
of
progress
to
what
then
may
we
not
look
forward
when
a
spirit
of
scientific
inquiry
shall
have
spread
through
those
vast
regions
in
which
the
progress
of
civilization
its
sure

is

in

what
may
we

the

of
powerful

the
hope
of
progress
there
are
two
lines
if
not
more
in
which
we
may
look
forward
with
hope
to
progress
in
the
future
in
the
first
place
increased
knowledge
of
nature
of
the
properties
of
matter
and
of
the
phenomena
which
surround
us
may
afford
to
our
children
advantages
far
greater
even
than
those
which
we
ourselves
enjoy
secondly
the
extension
and
improvement
of
education
the
increasing
influence
of
science
and
art
of
poetry
and
music
of
literature
and
religion
of
all
the
powers
which
are
tending
to
good
will
we
may
reasonably
hope
raise
man
and
make
him
more
master
of
himself
more
able
to
appreciate
and
enjoy
his
advantages
and
to
realize
the
truth
of
the
italian
proverb
that
wherever
light
is
there
is
joy
one
consideration
which
has
greatly
tended
to
retard
progress
has
been
the
floating
idea
that
there
was
some
sort
of
ingratitude
and
even
impiety
in
attempting
to
improve
on
what
divine
providence
had
arranged
for
us
thus
prometheus
was
said
to
have
incurred
the
wrath
of
jove
for
bestowing
on
mortals
the
use
of
fire
and
other
improvements
only
escaped
similar
punishment
when
the
ingenuity
of
priests
attributed
them
to
the
special
favor
of
some
particular
deity
this
feeling
has
not
even
yet
quite
died
out
even
i
can
remember
the
time
when
many
excellent
persons
had
a
scruple
or
prejudice
against
the
use
of
chloroform
because
they
fancied
that
pain
was
ordained
under
certain
circumstances
we
are
told
that
in
early
saxon
days
edwin
king
of
northumbria
called
his
nobles
and
his
priests
around
him
to
discuss
whether
a
certain
missionary
should
be
heard
or
not
the
king
was
doubtful
at
last
there
rose
an
old
chief
and
said
you
know
o
king
how
on
a
winter
evening
when
you
are
sitting
at
supper
in
your
hall
with
your
company
around
you
when
the
night
is
dark
and
dreary
when
the
rain
and
the
snow
rage
outside
when
the
hall
inside
is
lighted
and
warm
with
a
blazing
fire
sometimes
it
happens
that
a
sparrow
flies
into
the
bright
hall
out
of
the
dark
night
flies
through
the
hall
and
then
flies
out
at
the
other
end
into
the
dark
night
again
we
see
him
for
a
few
moments
but
we
know
not
whence
he
came
nor
whither
he
goes
in
the
blackness
of
the
storm
outside
so
is
the
life
of
man
it
appears
for
a
short
space
in
the
warmth
and
brightness
of
this
life
but
what
came
before
this
life
or
what
is
to
follow
this
life
we
know
not
if
therefore
these
new
teachers
can
enlighten
us
as
to
the
darkness
that
went
before
and
the
darkness
that
is
to
come
after
let
us
hear
what
they
have
to
teach
us
it
is
often
said
however
that
great
and
unexpected
as
recent
discoveries
have
been
there
are
certain
ultimate
problems
which
must
ever
remain
unsolved
for
my
part
i
would
prefer
to
abstain
from
laying
down
any
such
limitations
when
park
asked
the
arabs
what
became
of
the
sun
at
night
and
whether
the
sun
was
always
the
same
or
new
each
day
they
replied
that
such
a
question
was
foolish
being
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
human
investigation
comte
in
his
de
philosophie
as
recently
as
laid
it
down
as
an
axiom
regarding
the
heavenly
bodies
we
may
hope
to
determine
their
forms
distances
magnitude
and
movements
but
we
shall
never
by
any
means
be
able
to
study
their
chemical
composition
or
mineralogical
structure
yet
within
a
few
years
this
supposed
impossibility
has
been
actually
accomplished
showing
how
unsafe
it
is
to
limit
the
possibilities
of
science
it
is
indeed
as
true
now
as
in
the
time
of
newton
that
the
great
ocean
of
truth
lies
undiscovered
before
us
i
often
wish
that
some
president
of
the
royal
society
or
of
the
british
association
would
take
for
the
theme
of
his
annual
address
the
things
we
do
not
know
who
can
say
on
the
verge
of
what
discoveries
we
are
perhaps
even
now
standing
it
is
extraordinary
how
slight
a
margin
may
stand
for
years
between
man
and
some
important
improvement
take
the
case
of
the
electric
light
for
instance
it
had
been
known
for
years
that
if
a
carbon
rod
be
placed
in
an
exhausted
glass
receiver
and
a
current
of
electricity
be
passed
through
it
the
carbon
glowed
with
an
intense
light
but
on
the
other
hand
it
became
so
hot
that
the
glass
burst
the
light
therefore
was
useless
because
the
lamp
burst
as
soon
as
it
was
lighted
edison
hit
on
the
idea
that
if
you
made
the
carbon
filament
fine
enough
you
would
get
rid
of
the
heat
and
yet
have
abundance
of
light
edison
right
to
his
patent
has
been
contested
on
this
very
ground
it
has
been
said
that
the
mere
introduction
of
so
small
a
difference
as
the
replacement
of
a
thin
rod
by
a
fine
filament
was
so
slight
an
item
that
it
could
not
be
patented
the
improvements
by
swan
lane
fox
and
others
though
so
important
as
a
whole
have
been
made
step
by
step
or
take
again
the
discovery
of
anaesthetics
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
sir
humphrey
discovered
laughing
gas
as
it
was
then
called
he
found
that
it
produced
complete
insensibility
to
pain
and
yet
did
not
injure
health
a
tooth
was
actually
taken
out
under
its
influence
and
of
course
without
suffering
these
facts
were
known
to
our
chemists
they
were
explained
to
the
students
in
our
great
hospitals
and
yet
for
half
a
century
the
obvious
application
occurred
to
no
one
operations
continued
to
be
performed
as
before
patients
suffered
the
same
horrible
tortures
and
yet
the
beneficent
element
was
in
our
hands
its
divine
properties
were
known
but
it
never
occurred
to
any
one
to
make
use
of
it
i
may
give
one
more
illustration
printing
is
generally
said
to
have
been
discovered
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
so
it
was
for
all
practical
purposes
but
in
fact
printing
was
known
long
before
the
romans
used
stamps
on
the
monuments
of
assyrian
kings
the
name
of
the
reigning
monarch
may
be
found
duly
printed
what
then
is
the
difference
one
little
but
step
the
real
inventor
of
printing
was
the
man
into
whose
mind
flashed
the
fruitful
idea
of
having
separate
stamps
for
each
letter
instead
of
for
separate
words
how
slight
seems
the
difference
and
yet
for
years
the
thought
occurred
to
no
one
who
can
tell
what
other
discoveries
as
simple
and
yet
as
lie
at
this
very
moment
under
our
very
eyes
archimedes
said
that
if
you
would
give
him
room
to
stand
on
he
would
move
the
earth
one
truth
leads
to
another
each
discovery
renders
possible
another
and
what
is
more
a
higher
we
are
but
beginning
to
realize
the
marvelous
range
and
complexity
of
nature
i
have
elsewhere
called
attention
to
this
with
special
reference
to
the
problematical
organs
of
sense
possessed
by
many
animals
there
is
every
reason
to
hope
that
future
studies
will
throw
much
light
on
these
interesting
structures
we
may
no
doubt
expect
much
from
the
improvement
in
our
microscopes
the
use
of
new
and
of
mechanical
appliances
but
the
ultimate
atoms
of
which
matter
is
composed
are
so
infinitesimally
minute
that
it
is
difficult
to
foresee
any
manner
in
which
we
may
hope
for
a
final
solution
of
these
problems
loschmidt
who
has
since
been
confirmed
by
stoney
and
sir
thomson
calculates
that
each
of
the
ultimate
atoms
of
matter
is
at
most
of
an
inch
in
diameter
under
these
circumstances
we
can
not
it
would
seem
hope
at
present
for
any
great
increase
of
our
knowledge
of
atoms
by
improvements
in
the
microscope
with
our
present
instruments
we
can
perceive
lines
ruled
on
glass
which
are
of
an
inch
apart
but
owing
to
the
properties
of
light
itself
it
would
appear
that
we
can
not
hope
to
be
able
to
perceive
objects
which
are
much
less
than
of
an
inch
in
diameter
our
microscopes
may
no
doubt
be
improved
but
the
limitation
lies
not
in
the
imperfection
of
our
optical
appliances
but
in
the
nature
of
light
itself
it
has
been
calculated
that
a
particle
of
albumen
of
an
inch
in
diameter
contains
no
less
than
of
molecules
in
a
simpler
compound
the
number
would
be
much
greater
in
water
for
instance
no
less
than
even
then
if
we
could
construct
microscopes
far
more
powerful
than
any
which
we
now
possess
they
could
not
enable
us
to
obtain
by
direct
vision
any
idea
of
the
ultimate
organization
of
matter
the
smallest
sphere
of
organic
matter
which
could
be
clearly
defined
with
our
most
powerful
microscopes
may
be
in
reality
very
complex
may
be
built
up
of
many
millions
of
molecules
and
it
follows
that
there
may
be
an
almost
infinite
number
of
structural
characters
in
organic
tissues
which
we
can
at
present
foresee
no
mode
of
examining
again
it
has
been
shown
that
animals
hear
sounds
which
are
beyond
the
range
of
our
hearing
and
i
have
proved
they
can
perceive
the
rays
which
are
invisible
to
our
eyes
now
as
every
ray
of
homogeneous
light
which
we
can
perceive
at
all
appears
to
us
as
a
distinct
color
it
becomes
probable
that
these
rays
must
make
themselves
apparent
to
animals
as
a
distinct
and
separate
color
of
which
we
can
form
no
idea
but
as
different
from
the
rest
as
red
is
from
yellow
or
green
from
violet
the
question
also
arises
whether
white
light
to
these
creatures
would
differ
from
our
white
light
in
containing
this
additional
color
these
considerations
can
not
but
raise
the
reflection
how
different
the
world
may
i
was
going
to
say
must
appear
to
other
animals
from
what
it
does
to
us
sound
is
the
sensation
produced
on
us
when
the
vibrations
of
the
air
strike
on
the
drum
of
our
ear
when
they
are
few
the
sound
is
deep
as
they
increase
in
number
it
becomes
shriller
and
shriller
but
when
they
reach
in
a
second
they
cease
to
be
audible
light
is
the
effect
produced
on
us
when
waves
of
light
strike
on
the
eye
when
millions
of
millions
of
vibrations
of
ether
strike
the
retina
in
a
second
they
produce
red
and
as
the
number
increases
the
color
passes
into
orange
then
yellow
green
blue
and
violet
but
between
vibrations
in
a
second
and
millions
of
millions
we
have
no
organ
of
sense
capable
of
receiving
the
impression
yet
between
these
limits
any
number
of
sensations
may
exist
we
have
five
senses
and
sometimes
fancy
that
no
others
are
possible
but
it
is
obvious
that
we
can
not
measure
the
infinite
by
our
own
narrow
limitations
moreover
looking
at
the
question
from
the
other
side
we
find
in
animals
complex
organs
of
sense
richly
supplied
with
nerves
but
the
function
of
which
we
are
as
yet
powerless
to
explain
there
may
be
fifty
other
senses
as
different
from
ours
as
sound
is
from
sight
and
even
within
the
boundaries
of
our
own
senses
there
may
be
endless
sounds
which
we
can
not
hear
and
colors
as
different
as
red
from
green
of
which
we
have
no
conception
these
and
a
thousand
other
questions
remain
for
solution
the
familiar
world
which
surrounds
us
may
be
a
totally
different
place
to
other
animals
to
them
it
may
be
full
of
music
which
we
can
not
hear
of
color
which
we
can
not
see
of
sensations
which
we
can
not
conceive
to
place
stuffed
birds
and
beasts
in
glass
cases
to
arrange
insects
in
cabinets
and
dried
plants
in
drawers
is
merely
the
drudgery
and
preliminary
of
study
to
watch
their
habits
to
understand
their
relations
to
one
another
to
study
their
instincts
and
intelligence
to
ascertain
their
adaptations
and
their
relations
to
the
forces
of
nature
to
realize
what
the
world
appears
to
them
these
constitute
as
it
seems
to
me
at
least
the
true
interest
of
natural
history
and
may
even
give
us
the
clue
to
senses
and
perceptions
of
which
at
present
we
have
no
conception
from
this
point
of
view
the
possibilities
of
progress
seem
to
me
to
be
almost
unlimited
so
far
again
as
the
actual
condition
of
man
is
concerned
the
fact
that
there
has
been
some
advance
can
not
i
think
be
questioned
in
the
middle
ages
for
instance
culture
and
refinement
scarcely
existed
beyond
the
limits
of
courts
and
by
no
means
always
there
the
life
in
english
french
and
german
castles
was
rough
and
almost
barbarous
galton
has
expressed
the
opinion
which
i
am
not
prepared
to
question
that
the
population
of
athens
taken
as
a
whole
was
as
superior
to
us
as
we
are
to
australian
savages
but
even
if
that
be
so
our
civilization
such
as
it
is
is
more
diffused
so
that
unquestionably
the
general
european
level
is
much
higher
much
no
doubt
is
owing
to
the
greater
facility
of
access
to
the
literature
of
our
country
to
that
literature
in
the
words
of
macaulay
the
brightest
the
purest
the
most
durable
of
all
the
glories
of
our
country
to
that
literature
so
rich
in
precious
truth
and
precious
fiction
to
that
literature
which
boasts
of
the
prince
of
all
poets
and
of
the
prince
of
all
philosophers
to
that
literature
which
has
exercised
an
influence
wider
than
that
of
our
commerce
and
mightier
than
that
of
our
arms
few
of
us
make
the
most
of
our
minds
the
body
ceases
to
grow
in
a
few
years
but
the
mind
if
we
will
let
it
may
grow
as
long
as
life
lasts
the
onward
progress
of
the
future
will
not
we
may
be
sure
be
confined
to
mere
material
discoveries
we
feel
that
we
are
on
the
road
to
higher
mental
powers
that
problems
which
now
seem
to
us
beyond
the
range
of
human
thought
will
receive
their
solution
and
open
the
way
to
still
further
advance
progress
moreover
we
may
hope
will
be
not
merely
material
not
merely
mental
but
moral
also
it
is
natural
that
we
should
feel
a
pride
in
the
beauty
of
england
in
the
size
of
our
cities
the
magnitude
of
our
commerce
the
wealth
of
our
country
the
vastness
of
our
empire
but
the
true
glory
of
a
nation
does
not
consist
in
the
extent
of
its
dominion
in
the
fertility
of
the
soil
or
the
beauty
of
nature
but
rather
in
the
moral
and
intellectual
of
the
people
and
yet
how
few
of
us
rich
or
poor
have
made
ourselves
all
we
might
be
if
he
does
his
best
as
shakespeare
says
what
a
piece
of
work
is
man
how
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculty
in
form
and
movement
how
express
and
admirable
few
indeed
as
yet
can
be
said
to
reach
this
high
ideal
the
hindoos
have
a
theory
that
after
death
animals
live
again
in
a
different
form
those
that
have
done
well
in
a
higher
those
that
have
done
ill
in
a
lower
grade
to
realize
this
is
they
find
a
powerful
incentive
to
a
virtuous
life
but
whether
it
be
true
of
a
future
life
or
not
it
is
certainly
true
of
our
present
existence
if
we
do
our
best
for
a
day
the
next
morning
we
shall
rise
to
a
higher
life
while
if
we
give
way
to
our
passions
and
temptations
we
take
with
equal
certainty
a
step
downward
toward
a
lower
nature
it
is
an
interesting
illustration
of
the
unity
of
man
and
an
encouragement
to
those
of
us
who
have
no
claims
to
genius
that
though
of
course
there
have
been
exceptions
still
on
the
whole
periods
of
progress
have
generally
been
those
when
a
nation
has
worked
and
felt
together
the
advance
has
been
due
not
entirely
to
the
efforts
of
a
few
great
men
but
also
of
a
thousand
little
men
not
to
a
single
genius
but
to
a
national
effort
think
indeed
what
might
be
ah
when
shall
all
men
good
be
each
man
rule
and
universal
peace
lie
like
a
shaft
of
light
across
the
land
and
like
a
lane
of
beams
athwart
the
sea
thro
all
the
circle
of
the
golden
year
our
life
is
surrounded
with
mystery
our
very
world
is
a
speck
in
boundless
space
and
not
only
the
period
of
our
own
individual
life
but
that
of
the
whole
human
race
is
as
it
were
but
a
moment
in
the
eternity
of
time
we
can
not
imagine
any
origin
nor
foresee
the
conclusion
but
though
we
may
not
as
yet
perceive
any
line
of
research
which
can
give
us
a
clue
to
the
solution
in
another
sense
we
may
hold
that
every
addition
to
our
knowledge
is
one
small
step
toward
the
great
revelation
progress
may
be
more
slow
or
more
rapid
it
may
come
to
others
and
not
to
us
it
will
not
come
to
us
if
we
do
not
strive
to
deserve
it
but
come
it
surely
will
yet
one
thing
is
there
that
ye
shall
not
slay
even
thought
that
fire
nor

can
affright
the

the

but
though
we
have
thus
a
sure
and
certain
hope
of
progress
for
the
race
still
as
far
as
man
is
individually
concerned
with
advancing
years
we
gradually
care
less
and
less
for
many
things
which
gave
us
the
greatest
pleasure
in
youth
on
the
other
hand
if
our
time
has
been
well
used
if
we
have
warmed
both
hands
wisely
before
the
fire
of
life
we
may
gain
even
more
than
we
lose
if
our
strength
becomes
less
we
feel
also
the
less
necessity
for
exertion
hope
is
gradually
replaced
by
memory
and
whether
this
adds
to
our
happiness
or
not
depends
on
what
our
life
has
been
there
are
of
course
some
lives
which
diminish
in
value
as
old
age
advances
in
which
one
pleasure
fades
after
another
and
even
those
which
remain
gradually
lose
their
zest
but
there
are
others
which
gain
in
richness
and
peace
all
and
more
than
that
of
which
time
robs
them
the
pleasures
of
youth
may
excel
in
keenness
and
in
zest
but
they
have
at
the
best
a
tinge
of
anxiety
and
unrest
they
can
not
have
the
fulness
and
depth
which
may
accompany
the
consolations
of
age
and
are
amongst
the
richest
rewards
of
an
unselfish
life
for
as
with
the
close
of
the
day
so
with
that
of
life
there
may
be
clouds
and
yet
if
the
horizon
is
clear
the
evening
may
be
beautiful
old
age
has
a
rich
store
of
memories
life
is
full
of
joys
too
exquisite
to
last
and
yet
more
exquisite
when
past
swedenborg
imagines
that
in
heaven
the
angels
are
advancing
continually
to
the
of
their
youth
so
that
those
who
have
lived
longest
are
really
the
youngest
and
have
we
not
all
had
friends
who
seem
to
fulfil
this
idea
who
are
in
reality
that
is
in
mind
as
fresh
as
a
child
of
whom
it
may
be
said
with
more
truth
than
of
cleopatra
that
age
can
not
wither
nor
custom
stale
their
infinite
variety
when
i
consider
old
age
says
cicero
i
find
four
causes
why
it
is
thought
miserable
one
that
it
calls
us
away
from
the
transaction
of
affairs
the
second
that
it
renders
the
body
more
feeble
the
third
that
it
deprives
us
of
almost
all
pleasures
the
fourth
that
it
is
not
very
far
from
death
of
these
causes
let
us
see
if
you
please
how
great
and
how
reasonable
each
of
them
is
to
be
released
from
the
absorbing
affairs
of
life
to
feel
that
one
has
earned
a
claim
to
leisure
and
repose
is
surely
in
itself
no
evil
to
the
second
complaint
against
old
age
i
have
already
referred
in
speaking
of
health
the
third
is
that
it
has
no
passions
o
noble
privilege
of
age
if
indeed
it
takes
from
us
that
which
is
in
youth
our
greatest
defect
but
the
higher
feelings
of
our
nature
are
not
necessarily
weakened
or
rather
they
may
become
all
the
brighter
being
purified
from
the
grosser
elements
of
our
lower
nature
then
indeed
it
might
be
said
that
man
is
the
sun
of
the
world
more
than
the
real
sun
the
fire
of
his
wonderful
heart
is
the
only
light
and
heat
worth
gauge
or
measure
single
says
manu
is
each
man
born
into
the
world
single
he
dies
single
he
receives
the
rewards
of
his
good
deeds
and
single
the
punishment
of
his
sins
when
he
dies
his
body
lies
like
a
fallen
tree
upon
the
earth
but
his
virtue
accompanies
his
soul
wherefore
let
man
harvest
and
garner
virtue
that
so
he
may
have
an
inseparable
companion
in
that
gloom
which
all
must
pass
through
and
which
it
is
so
hard
to
traverse
is
it
not
extraordinary
that
many
men
will
deliberately
take
a
road
which
they
know
is
to
say
the
least
not
that
of
happiness
that
they
prefer
to
make
others
miserable
rather
than
themselves
happy
plato
in
the
phaedrus
explains
this
by
describing
man
as
a
composite
being
having
three
natures
and
compares
him
to
a
pair
of
winged
horses
and
a
charioteer
of
the
two
horses
one
is
noble
and
of
noble
origin
the
other
ignoble
and
of
ignoble
origin
and
the
driving
as
might
be
expected
is
no
easy
matter
the
noble
steed
endeavors
to
raise
the
chariot
but
the
ignoble
one
struggles
to
drag
it
down
man
says
shelly
is
an
instrument
over
which
a
series
of
external
and
internal
impressions
are
driven
like
the
alternations
of
an
wind
over
an
aeolian
lyre
which
move
it
by
their
motion
to
melody
cicero
mentions
the
approach
of
death
as
the
fourth
drawback
of
old
age
to
many
minds
the
shadow
of
the
end
is
ever
present
like
the
coffin
in
the
egyptian
feast
and
overclouds
all
the
sunshine
of
life
but
ought
we
so
to
regard
death
shelly
beautiful
lines
life
like
a
dome
of
glass
stains
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
until
death
tramples
it
to
fragments
contain
as
it
seems
to
me
at
least
a
double
error
life
need
not
stain
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
nor
does
death
necessarily
trample
it
to
fragments
man
has
says
coleridge
three
treasures
love
and
light
and
calm
thoughts
regular
as
infants

and
three
firm
friends

sure

death
is
the
end
of
all
the
remedy
of
many
the
wish
of
divers
men
deserving
better
of
no
men
than
of
those
to
whom
she
came
before
she
was
called
it
is
often
assumed
that
the
journey
to
the
undiscovered
country
from
whose
bourne
no
traveler
returns
must
be
one
of
pain
and
suffering
but
this
is
not
so
death
is
often
peaceful
and
almost
painless
bede
during
his
late
illness
was
translating
john
gospel
into
and
the
morning
of
his
death
his
secretary
observing
his
weakness
said
there
remains
now
only
one
chapter
and
it
seems
difficult
to
you
to
speak
it
is
easy
said
bede
take
your
pen
and
write
as
fast
as
you
can
at
the
close
of
the
chapter
the
scribe
said
it
is
finished
to
which
he
replied
thou
hast
said
the
truth
he
then
divided
his
little
property
among
the
brethren
having
done
which
he
asked
to
be
placed
opposite
to
the
place
where
he
usually
prayed
said
glory
be
to
the
father
and
to
the
son
and
to
the
holy
ghost
and
as
he
pronounced
the
last
words
he
expired
goethe
died
without
any
apparent
suffering
having
just
prepared
himself
to
write
and
expressed
his
delight
at
the
return
of
spring
we
are
told
of
mozart
death
that
the
unfinished
requiem
lay
upon
the
bed
and
his
last
efforts
were
to
imitate
some
peculiar
instrumental
effects
as
he
breathed
out
his
life
in
the
arms
of
his
wife
and
their
friend
süssmaier
plato
died
in
the
act
of
writing
lucan
while
reciting
part
of
his
book
on
the
war
of
pharsalus
blake
died
singing
wagner
in
sleep
with
his
head
on
his
wife
shoulder
many
have
passed
away
in
their
sleep
various
high
medical
authorities
have
expressed
their
surprise
that
the
dying
seldom
feel
either
dismay
or
regret
and
even
those
who
perish
by
violence
as
for
instance
in
battle
feel
it
is
probable
but
little
suffering
but
what
of
the
future
there
may
be
said
to
be
now
two
principal
views
there
are
some
who
believe
indeed
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
but
not
of
the
individual
soul
that
our
life
is
continued
in
that
of
our
children
would
seem
indeed
to
be
the
natural
deduction
from
the
simile
of
paul
as
that
of
the
grain
of
wheat
is
carried
on
in
the
plant
of
the
following
year
so
long
indeed
as
happiness
exists
it
is
selfish
to
dwell
too
much
on
our
own
share
in
it
admit
that
the
soul
is
immortal
but
that
in
the
future
state
of
existence
there
is
a
break
in
the
continuity
of
memory
that
one
does
not
remember
the
present
life
and
from
this
point
of
view
is
not
the
importance
of
identity
involved
in
that
of
continuous
memory
but
however
this
may
be
according
to
the
general
view
the
soul
though
detached
from
the
body
will
retain
its
conscious
identity
and
will
awake
from
death
as
it
does
from
sleep
so
that
if
we
can
not
affirm
that
millions
of
spiritual
creatures
walk
the
earth
unseen
both
when
we
wake
and
when
we
sleep
at
any
rate
they
exist
somewhere
else
in
space
and
we
are
indeed
looking
at
them
when
we
gaze
at
the
stars
though
to
our
eyes
they
are
as
yet
invisible
in
neither
case
however
can
death
be
regarded
as
an
evil
to
wish
that
youth
and
strength
were
unaffected
by
time
might
be
a
different
matter
but
if
we
are
not
destined
to
be
immortal
yet
it
is
a
desirable
thing
for
a
man
to
expire
at
his
fit
time
for
as
nature
prescribes
a
boundary
to
all
other
things
so
does
she
also
to
life
now
old
age
is
the
consummation
of
life
just
as
of
a
play
from
the
fatigue
of
which
we
ought
to
escape
especially
when
satiety
is
from
this
point
of
view
then
we
need
weep
not
for
death
is
but
a
fever
stilled
a
pain
suppressed
a
fear
at
rest
a
solemn
hope
fulfilled
the
moonshine
on
the
slumbering
deep
is
scarcely
calmer
wherefore
weep
weep
not
for
death
the
fount
of
tears
is
sealed
who
knows
how
bright
the
inward
light
to
those
closed
eyes
revealed
who
knows
what
holy
love
may
fill
the
heart
that
seems
so
cold
and
still
many
a
weary
soul
will
have
recurred
with
comfort
to
the
thought
that
a
few
more
years
shall
roll
a
few
more
seasons
come
and
we
shall
be
with
those
that
rest
asleep
within
the
tomb
a
few
more
struggles
here
a
few
more
partings
a
few
more
toils
a
few
more
tears
and
we
shall
weep
no
more
by
no
one
has
this
however
been
more
grandly
expressed
than
by
shelley
peace
peace
he
is
not
dead
he
doth
not
sleep
he
hath
awakened
from
the
dream
of
life
is
we
who
lost
in
stormy
visions
keep
with
phantoms
an
unprofitable
strife
he
has
outsoared
the
shadows
of
our
night
envy
and
calumny
and
hate
and
pain
and
that
unrest
which
men
miscall
delight
can
touch
him
not
and
torture
not
again
from
the
contagion
of
the
world
slow
stain
he
is
secure
and
now
can
never
mourn
a
heart
grown
cold
a
head
grown
gray
in
vain
most
men
however
decline
to
believe
that
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
according
to
the
more
general
view
death
frees
the
soul
from
the
encumbrance
of
the
spirit
and
summons
us
to
the
seat
of
judgment
in
fact
there
is
no
death
what
seems
so
is
transition
this
life
of
mortal
breath
is
but
a
suburb
of
the
life
elysian
whose
portal
we
call
death
we
have
bodies
we
are
spirits
i
am
a
soul
said
epictetus
dragging
about
a
corpse
the
body
is
the
mere
perishable
form
of
the
immortal
essence
plato
concluded
that
if
the
ways
of
god
are
to
be
justified
there
must
be
a
future
life
to
the
aged
in
either
case
death
is
a
release
the
bible
dwells
most
forcibly
on
the
blessing
of
peace
my
peace
i
give
unto
you
not
as
the
world
giveth
give
i
unto
you
heaven
is
described
as
a
place
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
but
i
suppose
every
one
must
have
asked
himself
in
what
can
the
pleasures
of
heaven
consist
for
all
we
know
of
what
the
blessed
do
above
is
that
they
sing
and
that
they
love
it
would
indeed
accord
with
few
men
ideal
that
there
should
be
any
struggle
for
existence
in
heaven
we
should
then
be
little
better
off
than
we
are
now
this
world
is
very
beautiful
if
we
could
only
enjoy
it
in
peace
and
yet
mere
passive
existence
mere
vegetation
would
in
itself
offer
few
attractions
it
would
indeed
be
almost
intolerable
again
the
anxiety
of
change
seems
inconsistent
with
perfect
happiness
and
yet
a
wearisome
interminable
monotony
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
forever
and
ever
without
relief
or
variety
suggests
dulness
rather
than
bliss
i
feel
that
to
me
said
greg
god
has
promised
not
the
heaven
of
the
ascetic
temper
or
the
dogmatic
theologian
or
of
the
subtle
mystic
or
of
the
stern
martyr
ready
alike
to
inflict
and
bear
but
a
heaven
of
purified
and
permanent
affections
of
a
book
of
knowledge
with
eternal
leaves
and
unbounded
capacities
to
read
it
of
those
we
love
ever
round
us
never
misconceiving
us
or
being
harassed
by
us
of
glorious
work
to
do
and
adequate
faculties
to
do
it
a
world
of
solved
problems
as
well
as
of
realized
ideals
for
still
the
doubt
came
back
can
god
provide
for
the
large
heart
of
man
what
shall
not
pall
nor
through
eternal
ages
endless
tide
on
tired
spirits
fall
these
make
him
say
if
god
has
so
arrayed
a
fading
world
that
quickly
passes
by
such
rich
provision
of
delight
has
made
for
every
human
eye
what
shall
the
eyes
that
wait
for
him
survey
when
his
own
presence
gloriously
appears
in
worlds
that
were
not
founded
for
a
day
but
for
eternal
years
here
science
seems
to
suggest
a
possible
answer
the
solution
of
problems
which
have
puzzled
us
here
the
acquisition
of
new
ideas
the
unrolling
the
history
of
the
past
the
world
of
animals
and
plants
the
secrets
of

the
wonders
of

own
world
would
indeed
be
something
to
look
forward
to
and
our
world
is
but
one
of
many
millions
i
sometimes
wonder
as
i
look
away
to
the
stars
at
night
whether
it
will
ever
be
my
privilege
as
a
disembodied
spirit
to
visit
and
explore
them
when
we
had
made
the
great
tour
fresh
interests
would
have
arisen
and
we
might
well
begin
again
here
there
is
an
infinity
of
interest
without
anxiety
so
that
at
last
the
only
doubt
may
be
lest
an
eternity
should
not
suffice
to
take
the
measure
and
the
breadth
and
height
of
what
there
is
reserved
in
paradise
its
delight
cicero
surely
did
not
exaggerate
when
he
said
o
glorious
day
when
i
shall
depart
to
that
divine
company
and
assemblage
of
spirits
and
quit
this
troubled
and
polluted
scene
for
i
shall
go
not
only
to
those
great
men
of
whom
i
have
spoken
before
but
also
to
my
son
cato
than
whom
never
was
better
man
born
nor
more
distinguished
for
pious
affection
whose
body
was
burned
by
me
whereas
on
the
contrary
it
was
fitting
that
mine
should
be
burned
by
him
but
his
soul
not
deserting
me
but
oft
looking
back
no
doubt
departed
to
these
regions
whither
it
saw
that
i
myself
was
destined
to
come
which
though
a
distress
to
me
i
seemed
patiently
to
endure
not
that
i
bore
it
with
indifference
but
i
comforted
myself
with
the
recollection
that
the
separation
and
distance
between
us
would
not
continue
long
for
these
reasons
o
scipio
since
you
said
that
you
with
laelius
were
accustomed
to
wonder
at
this
old
age
is
tolerable
to
me
and
not
only
not
irksome
but
even
delightful
and
if
i
am
wrong
in
this
that
i
believe
the
souls
of
men
to
be
immortal
i
willingly
delude
myself
nor
do
i
desire
that
this
mistake
in
which
i
take
pleasure
should
be
wrested
from
me
as
long
as
i
live
but
if
i
when
dead
shall
have
no
consciousness
as
some
philosophers
imagine
i
do
not
fear
lest
dead
philosophers
should
ridicule
this
my
delusion
nor
can
i
omit
the
striking
passage
in
the
when
pleading
before
the
people
of
athens
socrates
says
let
us
reflect
in
another
way
and
we
shall
see
that
there
is
great
reason
to
hope
that
death
is
a
good
for
one
of
two
things
either
death
is
a
state
of
nothingness
and
utter
unconsciousness
or
as
men
say
there
is
a
change
and
migration
of
the
soul
from
this
world
to
another
now
if
you
suppose
that
there
is
no
consciousness
but
a
sleep
like
the
sleep
of
him
who
is
undisturbed
even
by
the
sight
of
dreams
death
will
be
an
unspeakable
gain
for
if
a
person
were
to
select
the
night
in
which
his
sleep
was
undisturbed
even
by
dreams
and
were
to
compare
with
this
the
other
days
and
nights
of
his
life
and
then
were
to
tell
us
how
many
days
and
nights
he
had
passed
in
the
course
of
his
life
better
and
more
pleasantly
than
this
one
i
think
that
any
man
i
will
not
say
a
private
man
but
even
the
great
king
will
not
find
many
such
days
or
nights
when
compared
with
the
others
now
if
death
is
like
this
i
say
that
to
die
is
gain
for
eternity
is
then
only
a
single
night
but
if
death
is
the
journey
to
another
place
and
there
as
men
say
all
the
dead
are
what
good
o
my
friends
and
judges
can
be
greater
than
this
if
indeed
when
the
pilgrim
arrives
in
the
world
below
he
is
delivered
from
the
professors
of
justice
in
this
world
and
finds
the
true
judges
who
are
said
to
give
judgment
there
minos
and
rhadamanthus
and
aeacus
and
triptolemus
and
other
sons
of
god
who
were
righteous
in
their
own
life
that
pilgrimage
will
be
worth
making
what
would
not
a
man
give
if
he
might
converse
with
orpheus
and
musaeus
and
hesiod
and
homer
nay
if
this
be
true
let
me
die
again
and
again
i
myself
too
shall
have
a
wonderful
interest
in
there
meeting
and
conversing
with
palamedes
and
ajax
the
son
of
telamon
and
other
heroes
of
old
who
have
suffered
death
through
an
unjust
judgment
and
there
will
be
no
small
pleasure
as
i
think
in
comparing
my
own
sufferings
with
theirs
above
all
i
shall
then
be
able
to
continue
my
search
into
true
and
false
knowledge
as
in
this
world
so
also
in
that
and
i
shall
find
out
who
is
wise
and
who
pretends
to
be
wise
and
is
not
what
would
not
a
man
give
o
judges
to
be
able
to
examine
the
leader
of
the
great
trojan
expedition
or
odysseus
or
sisyphus
or
numberless
others
men
and
women
too
what
infinite
delight
would
there
be
in
conversing
with
them
and
asking
them
questions
in
another
world
they
do
not
put
a
man
to
death
for
asking
questions
assuredly
not
for
besides
being
happier
in
that
world
than
in
this
they
will
be
immortal
if
what
is
said
be
true
wherefore
o
judges
be
of
good
cheer
about
death
and
know
of
a
certainty
that
no
evil
can
happen
to
a
good
man
either
in
life
or
after
death
he
and
his
are
not
neglected
by
the
gods
nor
has
my
own
approaching
end
happened
by
mere
chance
but
i
see
clearly
that
to
die
and
be
released
was
better
for
me
and
therefore
the
oracle
gave
no
sign
for
which
reason
also
i
am
not
angry
with
my
condemners
or
with
my
accusers
they
have
done
me
no
harm
although
they
did
not
mean
to
do
me
any
good
and
for
this
i
may
gently
blame
them
the
hour
of
departure
has
arrived
and
we
go
our
ways
i
to
die
and
you
to
live
which
is
better
god
only
knows
in
the
of
we
are
promised
that
the
souls
of
the
righteous
are
in
the
hand
of
god
and
there
shall
no
torment
touch
them
in
the
sight
of
the
unwise
they
seemed
to
die
and
their
departure
is
taken
for
misery
and
their
going
from
us
to
be
utter
destruction
but
they
are
in
peace
for
though
they
be
punished
in
the
sight
of
men
yet
is
their
hope
full
of
immortality
and
having
been
a
little
chastised
they
shall
be
greatly
rewarded
for
god
proved
them
and
found
them
worthy
for
himself
and
assuredly
if
in
the
hour
of
death
the
conscience
is
at
peace
the
mind
need
not
be
troubled
the
future
is
full
of
doubt
indeed
but
fuller
still
of
hope
if
we
are
entering
upon
a
rest
after
the
struggles
of
life
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
that
to
many
a
weary
soul
will
be
a
welcome
bourne
and
even
then
we
may
say
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
on
the
other
hand
if
we
are
entering
on
a
new
sphere
of
existence
where
we
may
look
forward
to
meet
not
only
those
of
whom
we
have
heard
so
often
those
whose
works
we
have
read
and
admired
and
to
whom
we
owe
so
much
but
those
also
whom
we
have
loved
and
lost
when
we
shall
leave
behind
us
the
bonds
of
the
flesh
and
the
limitations
of
our
earthly
existence
when
we
shall
join
the
angels
and
archangels
and
all
the
company
of
heaven
then
indeed
we
may
cherish
a
sure
and
certain
hope
that
the
interests
and
pleasures
of
this
world
are
as
nothing
compared
to
those
of
the
life
that
awaits
us
in
our
eternal
home
