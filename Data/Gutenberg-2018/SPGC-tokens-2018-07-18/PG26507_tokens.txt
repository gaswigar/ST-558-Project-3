giving

regarding
the

have
expressed

chapter
i
in

volume
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
the
origin
and
history
of
the
negro
race
either
in
africa
or
in
america
my
attempt
is
to
deal
only
with
conditions
that
now
exist
and
bear
a
relation
to
the
negro
in
america
and
that
are
likely
to
exist
in
the
future
in
discussing
the
negro
it
is
always
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
unlike
all
the
other
inhabitants
of
america
he
came
here
without
his
own
consent
in
fact
was
compelled
to
leave
his
own
country
and
become
a
part
of
another
through
physical
force
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
in
our
efforts
to
change
and
improve
the
present
condition
of
the
negro
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
race
which
had
little
necessity
to
labour
in
its
native
country
after
being
brought
to
america
the
negroes
were
forced
to
labour
for
about
years
under
circumstances
which
were
calculated
not
to
inspire
them
with
love
and
respect
for
labour
this
constitutes
a
part
of
the
reason
why
i
insist
that
it
is
necessary
to
emphasise
the
matter
of
industrial
education
as
a
means
of
giving
the
black
man
the
foundation
of
a
civilisation
upon
which
he
will
grow
and
prosper
when
i
speak
of
industrial
education
however
i
wish
it
always
understood
that
i
mean
as
did
general
armstrong
the
founder
of
the
hampton
institute
for
thorough
academic
and
religious
training
to
go
side
by
side
with
industrial
training
mere
training
of
the
hand
without
the
culture
of
brain
and
heart
would
mean
little
the
first
slaves
were
brought
into
this
country
by
the
dutch
in
and
were
landed
at
jamestown
virginia
the
first
cargo
consisted
of
twenty
the
census
taken
in
shows
that
these
twenty
slaves
had
increased
to
about
of
this
number
were
residing
in
the
southern
states
and
were
scattered
throughout
the
northern
and
western
states
i
think
i
am
pretty
safe
in
predicting
that
the
census
to
be
taken
in
will
show
that
there
are
not
far
from
ten
millions
of
people
of
african
descent
in
the
united
states
the
great
majority
of
these
of
course
reside
in
the
southern
states
the
problem
is
how
to
make
these
millions
of
negroes
intelligent
economical
and
valuable
citizens
as
well
as
how
to
bring
about
proper
relations
between
them
and
the
white
citizens
among
whom
they
live
this
is
the
question
upon
which
i
shall
try
to
throw
some
light
in
the
chapters
which
follow
when
the
negroes
were
first
brought
to
america
they
were
owned
by
white
people
in
all
sections
of
this
country
as
is
well
known
in
the
new
england
the
middle
and
in
the
southern
states
it
was
soon
found
however
that
slave
labour
was
not
remunerative
in
the
northern
states
and
for
that
reason
by
far
the
greater
proportion
of
the
slaves
were
held
in
the
southern
states
where
their
labour
in
raising
cotton
rice
and
was
more
productive
the
growth
of
the
slave
population
in
america
was
constant
and
rapid
beginning
as
i
have
stated
with
fourteen
in
the
number
increased
at
such
a
rate
that
the
total
number
of
negroes
in
america
in
was
this
number
increased
by
to
a
few
people
predicted
that
freedom
would
result
disastrously
to
the
negro
as
far
as
numerical
increase
was
concerned
but
so
far
the
census
figures
have
failed
to
bear
out
this
prediction
on
the
other
hand
the
census
of
shows
that
the
negro
population
had
increased
from
in
to
years
after
the
war
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
rate
of
increase
in
the
future
will
be
still
greater
than
it
has
been
from
the
close
of
the
war
of
the
rebellion
up
to
the
present
time
for
the
reason
that
the
very
sudden
changes
which
took
place
in
the
life
of
the
negro
because
of
having
his
freedom
plunged
him
into
many
excesses
that
were
detrimental
to
his
physical
of
course
freedom
found
him
unprepared
in
clothing
in
shelter
and
in
knowledge
of
how
to
care
for
his
body
during
slavery
the
slave
mother
had
little
control
of
her
own
children
and
did
not
therefore
have
the
practice
and
experience
of
rearing
children
in
a
suitable
manner
now
that
the
negro
is
being
taught
in
thousands
of
schools
how
to
take
care
of
his
body
and
in
thousands
of
homes
mothers
are
learning
how
to
control
their
children
i
believe
that
the
rate
of
increase
as
i
have
stated
will
be
still
greater
than
it
has
been
in
the
past
in
too
many
cases
the
negro
had
the
idea
that
freedom
meant
merely
license
to
do
as
he
pleased
to
work
or
not
to
work
but
this
erroneous
idea
is
more
and
more
disappearing
by
reason
of
the
education
in
the
right
direction
which
the
negro
is
constantly
receiving
during
the
four
years
that
the
civil
war
lasted
the
greater
proportion
of
the
negroes
remained
in
the
south
and
worked
faithfully
for
the
support
of
their
masters
families
who
as
a
general
rule
were
away
in
the
war
the
which
the
negro
exhibited
during
the
war
marks
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
most
important
chapters
in
the
history
of
the
race
notwithstanding
he
knew
that
his
master
was
away
from
home
fighting
a
battle
which
if
successful
would
result
in
his
continued
enslavement
yet
he
worked
faithfully
for
the
support
of
the
master
family
if
the
negro
had
yielded
to
the
temptation
and
suggestion
to
use
the
torch
or
dagger
in
an
attempt
to
destroy
his
master
property
and
family
the
result
would
have
been
that
the
war
would
have
been
ended
quickly
for
the
master
would
have
returned
from
the
battlefield
to
protect
and
defend
his
property
and
family
but
the
negro
to
the
last
was
faithful
to
the
trust
that
had
been
thrust
upon
him
and
during
the
four
years
of
war
in
which
the
male
members
of
the
family
were
absent
from
their
homes
there
is
not
a
single
instance
recorded
where
he
in
any
way
attempted
to
outrage
the
family
of
the
master
or
in
any
way
to
injure
his
property
not
only
is
this
true
but
all
through
the
years
of
preparation
for
the
war
and
during
the
war
itself
the
negro
showed
himself
to
be
an
uncompromising
friend
to
the
union
in
fact
of
all
the
charges
brought
against
him
there
is
scarcely
a
single
instance
where
one
has
been
charged
with
being
a
traitor
to
his
country
this
has
been
true
whether
he
has
been
in
a
state
of
slavery
or
in
a
state
of
freedom
from
to
constituted
what
perhaps
may
be
termed
the
days
of
reconstruction
this
was
the
period
when
the
southern
states
which
had
withdrawn
from
the
union
were
making
an
effort
to
reinstate
themselves
and
to
establish
a
permanent
system
of
state
government
at
the
close
of
the
war
both
the
southern
white
man
and
the
negro
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
poverty
the
returned
from
the
war
to
find
his
slave
property
gone
his
farms
and
other
industries
in
a
state
of
collapse
and
the
whole
industrial
or
economic
system
upon
which
he
had
depended
for
years
entirely
disorganised
as
we
review
calmly
and
dispassionately
the
period
of
reconstruction
we
must
use
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
and
generosity
the
weak
point
to
my
mind
in
the
reconstruction
era
was
that
no
strong
force
was
brought
to
bear
in
the
direction
of
preparing
the
negro
to
become
an
intelligent
reliable
citizen
and
voter
the
main
effort
seems
to
have
been
in
the
direction
of
controlling
his
vote
for
the
time
being
regardless
of
future
interests
i
hardly
believe
that
any
race
of
people
with
similar
preparation
and
similar
surroundings
would
have
acted
more
wisely
or
very
differently
from
the
way
the
negro
acted
during
the
period
of
reconstruction
without
experience
without
preparation
and
in
most
cases
without
ordinary
intelligence
he
was
encouraged
to
leave
the
field
and
shop
and
enter
politics
that
under
such
circumstances
he
should
have
made
mistakes
is
very
natural
i
do
not
believe
that
the
negro
was
so
much
at
fault
for
entering
so
largely
into
politics
and
for
the
mistakes
that
were
made
in
too
many
cases
as
were
the
unscrupulous
white
leaders
who
got
the
negro
confidence
and
controlled
his
vote
to
further
their
own
ends
regardless
in
many
cases
of
the
permanent
welfare
of
the
negro
i
have
always
considered
it
unfortunate
that
the
southern
white
man
did
not
make
more
of
an
effort
during
the
period
of
reconstruction
to
get
the
confidence
and
sympathy
of
the
negro
and
thus
have
been
able
to
keep
him
in
close
touch
and
sympathy
in
politics
it
was
also
unfortunate
that
the
negro
was
so
completely
alienated
from
the
southern
white
man
in
all
political
matters
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
for
all
concerned
if
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
war
an
educational
and
property
qualification
for
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
had
been
prescribed
that
would
have
applied
fairly
and
squarely
to
both
races
and
also
if
in
educating
the
negro
greater
stress
had
been
put
upon
training
him
along
the
lines
of
industry
for
which
his
services
were
in
the
greatest
demand
in
the
south
in
a
word
too
much
stress
was
placed
upon
the
mere
matter
of
voting
and
holding
political
office
rather
than
upon
the
preparation
for
the
highest
citizenship
in
saying
what
i
have
i
do
not
mean
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
whole
period
of
reconstruction
was
barren
of
fruitful
results
while
it
is
not
a
very
encouraging
chapter
in
the
history
of
our
country
i
believe
that
this
period
did
serve
to
point
out
many
weak
points
in
our
effort
to
elevate
the
negro
and
that
we
are
now
taking
advantage
of
the
mistakes
that
were
made
the
period
of
reconstruction
served
at
least
to
show
the
world
that
with
proper
preparation
and
with
a
sufficient
foundation
the
negro
possesses
the
elements
out
of
which
men
of
the
highest
character
and
usefulness
can
be
developed
i
might
name
several
characters
who
were
brought
before
the
world
by
reason
of
the
reconstruction
period
i
give
one
as
an
example
of
others
hon
blanche
bruce
who
had
been
a
slave
but
who
held
many
honourable
positions
in
the
state
of
mississippi
including
an
election
to
the
united
states
senate
where
he
served
a
full
term
later
he
was
twice
appointed
register
of
the
united
states
treasury
in
all
these
positions
bruce
gave
the
greatest
satisfaction
and
not
a
single
whisper
of
dishonesty
or
incompetency
has
ever
been
heard
against
him
during
the
period
of
his
public
life
he
was
brought
into
active
and
daily
contact
with
northern
and
southern
white
people
all
of
whom
speak
of
him
in
the
highest
measure
of
respect
and
confidence
what
the
negro
wants
and
what
the
country
wants
to
do
is
to
take
advantage
of
all
the
lessons
that
were
taught
during
the
days
of
reconstruction
and
apply
these
lessons
bravely
honestly
in
laying
the
foundation
upon
which
the
negro
can
stand
in
the
future
and
make
himself
a
useful
honourable
and
desirable
citizen
whether
he
has
his
residence
in
the
north
the
south
or
the
west
chapter
ii
in
order
that
the
reader
may
understand
me
and
why
i
lay
so
much
stress
upon
the
importance
of
pushing
the
doctrine
of
industrial
education
for
the
negro
it
is
necessary
first
of
all
to
review
the
condition
of
affairs
at
the
present
time
in
the
southern
states
for
years
i
have
had
something
of
an
opportunity
to
study
the
negro
at
and
i
feel
that
i
know
him
pretty
well
him
and
his
needs
his
failures
and
his
successes
his
desires
and
the
likelihood
of
their
fulfilment
i
have
studied
him
and
his
relations
with
his
white
neighbours
and
striven
to
find
how
these
relations
may
be
made
more
conducive
to
the
general
peace
and
welfare
both
of
the
south
and
of
the
country
at
large
in
the
southern
part
of
the
united
states
there
are
millions
of
people
who
are
bound
to
the
fifty
millions
of
the
north
by
ties
which
neither
can
tear
asunder
if
they
would
the
most
intelligent
in
a
new
york
community
has
his
intelligence
darkened
by
the
ignorance
of
a
in
the
mississippi
bottoms
the
most
wealthy
in
new
york
city
would
be
more
wealthy
but
for
the
poverty
of
a
in
the
carolina
rice
swamps
the
most
moral
and
religious
men
in
massachusetts
have
their
religion
and
morality
modified
by
the
degradation
of
the
man
in
the
south
whose
religion
is
a
mere
matter
of
form
or
of
emotionalism
the
vote
of
the
man
in
maine
that
is
cast
for
the
highest
and
purest
form
of
government
is
largely
neutralised
by
the
vote
of
the
man
in
louisiana
whose
ballot
is
stolen
or
cast
in
ignorance
therefore
when
the
south
is
ignorant
the
north
is
ignorant
when
the
south
is
poor
the
north
is
poor
when
the
south
commits
crime
the
nation
commits
crime
for
the
citizens
of
the
north
there
is
no
escape
they
must
help
raise
the
character
of
the
civilisation
in
the
south
or
theirs
will
be
lowered
no
member
of
the
white
race
in
any
part
of
the
country
can
harm
the
weakest
or
meanest
member
of
the
black
race
without
the
proudest
and
bluest
blood
of
the
nation
being
degraded
it
seems
to
me
that
there
never
was
a
time
in
the
history
of
the
country
when
those
interested
in
education
should
the
more
earnestly
consider
to
what
extent
the
mere
acquiring
of
the
ability
to
read
and
write
the
mere
acquisition
of
a
knowledge
of
literature
and
science
makes
men
producers
lovers
of
labour
independent
honest
unselfish
and
above
all
good
call
education
by
what
name
you
please
if
it
fails
to
bring
about
these
results
among
the
masses
it
falls
short
of
its
highest
end
the
science
the
art
the
literature
that
fails
to
reach
down
and
bring
the
humblest
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
fullest
blessings
of
our
government
is
weak
no
matter
how
costly
the
buildings
or
apparatus
used
or
how
modern
the
methods
of
instruction
employed
the
study
of
arithmetic
that
does
not
result
in
making
men
conscientious
in
receiving
and
counting
the
ballots
of
their
is
faulty
the
study
of
art
that
does
not
result
in
making
the
strong
less
willing
to
oppress
the
weak
means
little
how
i
wish
that
from
the
most
cultured
and
highly
endowed
university
in
the
great
north
to
the
humblest
log
cabin
in
alabama
we
could
burn
as
it
were
into
the
hearts
and
heads
of
all
that
usefulness
that
service
to
our
brother
is
the
supreme
end
of
education
putting
the
thought
more
directly
as
it
applies
to
conditions
in
the
south
can
you
make
the
intelligence
of
the
north
affect
the
south
in
the
same
ratio
that
the
ignorance
of
the
south
affects
the
north
let
us
take
a
not
improbable
case
a
great
national
case
is
to
be
decided
one
that
involves
peace
or
war
the
honour
or
dishonour
of
our
nation
yea
the
very
existence
of
the
government
the
north
and
west
are
divided
there
are
five
million
votes
to
be
cast
in
the
south
and
of
this
number
are
ignorant
not
only
are
the
voters
ignorant
but
because
of
the
ignorant
votes
they
cast
corruption
and
dishonesty
in
a
dozen
forms
have
crept
into
the
exercise
of
the
political
franchise
to
such
an
extent
that
the
conscience
of
the
intelligent
class
is
seared
in
its
attempts
to
defeat
the
will
of
the
ignorant
voters
here
then
you
have
on
the
one
hand
an
ignorant
vote
on
the
other
an
intelligent
vote
minus
a
conscience
the
time
may
not
be
far
off
when
to
this
kind
of
jury
we
shall
have
to
look
for
the
votes
which
shall
decide
in
a
large
measure
the
destiny
of
our
democratic
institutions
when
a
great
national
calamity
stares
us
in
the
face
we
are
i
fear
too
much
given
to
depending
on
a
short
campaign
of
education
to
do
on
the
hustings
what
should
have
been
accomplished
in
the
school
with
this
idea
in
view
let
us
examine
with
more
care
the
condition
of
civilisation
in
the
south
and
the
work
to
be
done
there
before
all
classes
will
be
fit
for
the
high
duties
of
citizenship
in
reference
to
the
negro
race
i
am
confronted
with
some
embarrassment
at
the
outset
because
of
the
various
and
conflicting
opinions
as
to
what
is
to
be
its
final
place
in
our
economic
and
political
life
within
the
last
thirty
years
and
i
might
add
within
the
last
three
months
it
has
been
proven
by
eminent
authority
that
the
negro
is
increasing
in
numbers
so
fast
that
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
few
years
before
he
will
far
outnumber
the
white
race
in
the
south
and
it
has
also
been
proven
that
the
negro
is
fast
dying
out
and
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
few
years
before
he
will
have
completely
disappeared
it
has
also
been
proven
that
education
helps
the
negro
and
that
education
hurts
him
that
he
is
fast
leaving
the
south
and
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
north
and
west
and
that
his
tendency
is
to
drift
toward
the
low
lands
of
the
mississippi
bottoms
it
has
been
proven
that
education
unfits
the
negro
for
work
and
that
education
makes
him
more
valuable
as
a
labourer
that
he
is
our
greatest
criminal
and
that
he
is
our
most
citizen
in
the
midst
of
these
conflicting
opinions
it
is
hard
to
hit
upon
the
truth
but
also
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
there
are
a
few
things
of
which
i
am
certain
things
which
furnish
a
basis
for
thought
and
action
i
know
that
whether
the
negroes
are
increasing
or
decreasing
whether
they
are
growing
better
or
worse
whether
they
are
valuable
or
valueless
that
a
few
years
ago
some
fourteen
of
them
were
brought
into
this
country
and
that
now
those
fourteen
are
nearly
ten
millions
i
know
that
whether
in
slavery
or
freedom
they
have
always
been
loyal
to
the
stars
and
stripes
that
no
has
been
opened
for
them
that
has
not
been
filled
that
the
ballots
that
they
have
the
right
to
cast
are
as
potent
for
weal
or
woe
as
an
equal
number
cast
by
the
wisest
and
most
influential
men
in
america
i
know
that
wherever
negro
life
touches
the
life
of
the
nation
it
helps
or
it
hinders
that
wherever
the
life
of
the
white
race
touches
the
black
it
makes
it
stronger
or
weaker
further
i
know
that
almost
every
other
race
that
has
tried
to
look
the
white
man
in
the
face
has
disappeared
i
know
despite
all
the
conflicting
opinions
and
with
a
full
knowledge
of
all
the
negroes
weaknesses
that
only
a
few
centuries
ago
they
went
into
slavery
in
this
country
pagans
that
they
came
out
christians
they
went
into
slavery
as
so
much
property
they
came
out
american
citizens
they
went
into
slavery
without
a
language
they
came
out
speaking
the
proud
tongue
they
went
into
slavery
with
the
chains
clanking
about
their
wrists
they
came
out
with
the
american
ballot
in
their
hands
i
submit
it
to
the
candid
and
sober
judgment
of
all
men
if
a
race
that
is
capable
of
such
a
test
such
a
transformation
is
not
worth
saving
and
making
a
part
in
reality
as
well
as
in
name
of
our
democratic
government
that
the
negro
may
be
fitted
for
the
fullest
enjoyment
of
the
privileges
and
responsibilities
of
our
citizenship
it
is
important
that
the
nation
be
honest
and
candid
with
him
whether
honesty
and
candour
for
the
time
being
pleases
or
displeases
him
it
is
with
an
ignorant
race
as
it
is
with
a
child
it
craves
at
first
the
superficial
the
ornamental
signs
of
progress
rather
than
the
reality
the
ignorant
race
is
tempted
to
jump
at
one
bound
to
the
position
that
it
has
required
years
of
hard
struggle
for
others
to
reach
it
seems
to
me
that
as
a
general
thing
the
temptation
in
the
past
in
educational
and
missionary
work
has
been
to
do
for
the
new
people
that
which
was
done
a
thousand
years
ago
or
that
which
is
being
done
for
a
people
a
thousand
miles
away
without
making
a
careful
study
of
the
needs
and
conditions
of
the
people
whom
it
is
designed
to
help
the
temptation
is
to
run
all
people
through
a
certain
educational
mould
regardless
of
the
condition
of
the
subject
or
the
end
to
be
accomplished
this
has
been
the
case
too
often
in
the
south
in
the
past
i
am
sure
men
have
tried
to
use
with
these
simple
people
just
freed
from
slavery
and
with
no
past
no
inherited
traditions
of
learning
the
same
methods
of
education
which
they
have
used
in
new
england
with
all
its
inherited
traditions
and
desires
the
negro
is
behind
the
white
man
because
he
has
not
had
the
same
chance
and
not
from
any
inherent
difference
in
his
nature
and
desires
what
the
race
accomplishes
in
these
first
fifty
years
of
freedom
will
at
the
end
of
these
years
in
a
large
measure
constitute
its
past
it
is
indeed
a
responsibility
that
rests
upon
this
nation
the
foundation
laying
for
a
people
of
its
past
present
and
future
at
one
and
the
same
time
one
of
the
weakest
points
in
connection
with
the
present
development
of
the
race
is
that
so
many
get
the
idea
that
the
mere
filling
of
the
head
with
a
knowledge
of
mathematics
the
sciences
and
literature
means
success
in
life
let
it
be
understood
in
every
corner
of
the
south
among
the
negro
youth
at
least
that
knowledge
will
benefit
little
except
as
it
is
harnessed
except
as
its
power
is
pointed
in
a
direction
that
will
bear
upon
the
present
needs
and
condition
of
the
race
there
is
in
the
heads
of
the
negro
youth
of
the
south
enough
general
and
floating
knowledge
of
chemistry
of
botany
of
zoölogy
of
geology
of
mechanics
of
electricity
of
mathematics
to
reconstruct
and
develop
a
large
part
of
the
agricultural
mechanical
and
domestic
life
of
the
race
but
how
much
of
it
is
brought
to
a
focus
along
lines
of
practical
work
in
cities
of
the
south
like
atlanta
how
many
coloured
mechanical
engineers
are
there
or
how
many
machinists
how
many
civil
engineers
how
many
architects
how
many
house
decorators
in
the
whole
state
of
georgia
where
eighty
per
cent
of
the
coloured
people
depend
upon
agriculture
how
many
men
are
there
who
are
well
grounded
in
the
principles
and
practices
of
scientific
farming
or
dairy
work
or
fruit
culture
or
floriculture
for
example
not
very
long
ago
i
had
a
conversation
with
a
young
coloured
man
who
is
a
graduate
of
one
of
the
prominent
universities
of
this
country
the
father
of
this
man
is
comparatively
ignorant
but
by
hard
work
and
the
exercise
of
common
sense
he
has
become
the
owner
of
two
thousand
acres
of
land
he
owns
more
than
a
score
of
horses
cows
and
mules
and
swine
in
large
numbers
and
is
considered
a
prosperous
farmer
in
college
the
son
of
this
farmer
has
studied
chemistry
botany
zoölogy
surveying
and
political
economy
in
my
conversation
i
asked
this
young
man
how
many
acres
his
father
cultivated
in
cotton
and
how
many
in
corn
with
a
gaze
up
into
the
heavens
he
answered
that
he
did
not
know
when
i
asked
him
the
classification
of
the
soils
on
his
father
farm
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
know
how
many
horses
or
cows
his
father
owned
nor
of
what
breeds
they
were
and
seemed
surprised
that
he
should
be
asked
such
questions
it
never
seemed
to
have
entered
his
mind
that
on
his
father
farm
was
the
place
to
make
his
chemistry
his
mathematics
and
his
literature
penetrate
and
reflect
itself
in
every
acre
of
land
every
bushel
of
corn
every
cow
and
every
pig
let
me
give
other
examples
of
this
mistaken
sort
of
education
when
a
mere
boy
i
saw
a
young
coloured
man
who
had
spent
several
years
in
school
sitting
in
a
common
cabin
in
the
south
studying
a
french
grammar
i
noted
the
poverty
the
untidiness
the
want
of
system
and
thrift
that
existed
about
the
cabin
notwithstanding
his
knowledge
of
french
and
other
academic
studies
again
not
long
ago
i
saw
a
coloured
minister
preparing
his
sunday
sermon
just
as
the
new
england
minister
prepares
his
sermon
but
this
coloured
minister
was
in
a
leaky
rented
log
cabin
with
weeds
in
the
yard
surrounded
by
evidences
of
poverty
filth
and
want
of
thrift
this
minister
had
spent
some
time
in
school
studying
theology
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
to
have
had
this
minister
taught
the
dignity
of
labour
taught
theoretical
and
practical
farming
in
connection
with
his
theology
so
that
he
could
have
added
to
his
meagre
salary
and
set
an
example
for
his
people
in
the
matter
of
living
in
a
decent
house
and
having
a
knowledge
of
correct
farming
in
a
word
this
minister
should
have
been
taught
that
his
condition
and
that
of
his
people
was
not
that
of
a
new
england
community
and
he
should
have
been
so
trained
as
to
meet
the
actual
needs
and
conditions
of
the
coloured
people
in
this
community
so
that
a
foundation
might
be
laid
that
would
in
the
future
make
a
community
like
new
england
communities
since
the
civil
war
no
one
object
has
been
more
misunderstood
than
that
of
the
object
and
value
of
industrial
education
for
the
negro
to
begin
with
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
condition
that
existed
in
the
south
immediately
after
the
war
and
that
now
exists
is
a
peculiar
one
without
a
parallel
in
history
this
being
true
it
seems
to
me
that
the
wise
and
honest
thing
to
do
is
to
make
a
study
of
the
actual
condition
and
environment
of
the
negro
and
do
that
which
is
best
for
him
regardless
of
whether
the
same
thing
has
been
done
for
another
race
in
exactly
the
same
way
there
are
those
among
the
white
race
and
those
among
the
black
race
who
assert
with
a
good
deal
of
earnestness
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
white
man
and
the
black
man
in
this
country
this
sounds
very
pleasant
and
tickles
the
fancy
but
when
the
test
of
hard
cold
logic
is
applied
to
it
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
there
is
a
difference
not
an
inherent
one
not
a
racial
one
but
a
difference
growing
out
of
unequal
opportunities
in
the
past
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
criticise
the
educational
work
that
has
been
done
in
the
south
i
would
say
that
the
weak
point
has
been
in
the
failure
to
recognise
this
difference
negro
education
immediately
after
the
war
in
most
cases
was
begun
too
nearly
at
the
point
where
new
england
education
had
ended
let
me
illustrate
one
of
the
saddest
sights
i
ever
saw
was
the
placing
of
a
three
hundred
dollar
rosewood
piano
in
a
country
school
in
the
south
that
was
located
in
the
midst
of
the
black
belt
am
i
arguing
against
the
teaching
of
instrumental
music
to
the
negroes
in
that
community
not
at
all
only
i
should
have
deferred
those
music
lessons
about
years
there
are
numbers
of
such
pianos
in
thousands
of
new
england
homes
but
behind
the
piano
in
the
new
england
home
there
are
one
hundred
years
of
toil
sacrifice
and
economy
there
is
the
small
manufacturing
industry
started
several
years
ago
by
hand
power
now
grown
into
a
great
business
there
is
ownership
in
land
a
comfortable
home
free
from
debt
and
a
bank
account
in
this
black
belt
community
where
this
piano
went
of
the
people
owned
no
land
many
lived
in
rented
cabins
many
were
in
debt
for
food
supplies
many
mortgaged
their
crops
for
the
food
on
which
to
live
and
not
one
had
a
bank
account
in
this
case
how
much
wiser
it
would
have
been
to
have
taught
the
girls
in
this
community
sewing
intelligent
and

the
boys
should
have
been
taught
something
of

in
connection
with
their
education

of
awakening
in
them
a

in

people

free
themselves
from

all
that
i
have
just
written
and
the
various
examples
illustrating
it
show
the
present
helpless
condition
of
my
people
in
the
south
how
fearfully
they
lack
the
primary
training
for
good
living
and
good
citizenship
how
much
they
stand
in
need
of
a
solid
foundation
on
which
to
build
their
future
success
i
believe
as
i
have
many
times
said
in
my
various
addresses
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
that
the
main
reason
for
the
existence
of
this
curious
state
of
affairs
is
the
lack
of
practical
training
in
the
ways
of
life
there
is
too
a
great
lack
of
money
with
which
to
carry
on
the
educational
work
in
the
south
i
was
in
a
county
in
a
southern
state
not
long
ago
where
there
are
some
thirty
thousand
coloured
people
and
about
seven
thousand
whites
in
this
county
not
a
single
public
school
for
negroes
had
been
open
that
year
longer
than
three
months
not
a
single
coloured
teacher
had
been
paid
more
than
per
month
for
his
teaching
not
one
of
these
schools
was
taught
in
a
building
that
was
worthy
of
the
name
of
in
this
county
the
state
or
public
authorities
do
not
own
a
single
dollar
worth
of
school
property
not
a
a
blackboard
or
a
piece
of
crayon
each
coloured
child
had
had
spent
on
him
that
year
for
his
education
about
fifty
cents
while
each
child
in
new
york
or
massachusetts
had
had
spent
on
him
that
year
for
education
not
far
from
and
yet
each
citizen
of
this
county
is
expected
to
share
the
burdens
and
privileges
of
our
democratic
form
of
government
just
as
intelligently
and
conscientiously
as
the
citizens
of
new
york
or
boston
a
vote
in
this
county
means
as
much
to
the
nation
as
a
vote
in
the
city
of
boston
crime
in
this
county
is
as
truly
an
arrow
aimed
at
the
heart
of
the
government
as
a
crime
committed
in
the
streets
of
boston
a
single
built
this
year
in
a
town
near
boston
to
shelter
about
three
hundred
pupils
cost
more
for
building
alone
than
is
spent
yearly
for
the
education
including
buildings
apparatus
teachers
for
the
whole
coloured
school
population
of
alabama
the
commissioner
of
education
for
the
state
of
georgia
not
long
ago
reported
to
the
state
legislature
that
in
that
state
there
were
two
hundred
thousand
children
that
had
entered
no
school
the
year
past
and
one
hundred
thousand
more
who
were
at
school
but
a
few
days
making
practically
three
hundred
thousand
children
between
six
and
eighteen
years
of
age
that
are
growing
up
in
ignorance
in
one
southern
state
alone
the
same
report
stated
that
outside
of
the
cities
and
towns
while
the
average
number
of
in
a
county
was
sixty
all
of
these
sixty
were
worth
in
lump
less
than
and
the
report
further
added
that
many
of
the
in
georgia
were
not
fit
for
horse
stables
i
am
glad
to
say
however
that
vast
improvement
over
this
condition
is
being
made
in
georgia
under
the
inspired
leadership
of
state
commissioner
glenn
and
in
alabama
under
the
no
less
zealous
leadership
of
commissioner
abercrombie
these
illustrations
so
far
as
they
concern
the
gulf
states
are
not
exceptional
cases
nor
are
they
overdrawn
until
there
is
industrial
independence
it
is
hardly
possible
to
have
good
living
and
a
pure
ballot
in
the
country
districts
in
these
states
it
is
safe
to
say
that
not
more
than
one
black
man
in
twenty
owns
the
land
he
cultivates
where
so
large
a
proportion
of
a
people
are
dependent
live
in
other
people
houses
eat
other
people
food
and
wear
clothes
they
have
not
paid
for
it
is
pretty
hard
to
expect
them
to
live
fairly
and
vote
honestly
i
have
thus
far
referred
mainly
to
the
negro
race
but
there
is
another
side
the
longer
i
live
and
the
more
i
study
the
question
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
not
so
much
a
problem
as
to
what
the
white
man
will
do
with
the
negro
as
what
the
negro
will
do
with
the
white
man
and
his
civilisation
in
considering
this
side
of
the
subject
i
thank
god
that
i
have
grown
to
the
point
where
i
can
sympathise
with
a
white
man
as
much
as
i
can
sympathise
with
a
black
man
i
have
grown
to
the
point
where
i
can
sympathise
with
a
southern
white
man
as
much
as
i
can
sympathise
with
a
northern
white
man
as
bearing
upon
the
future
of
our
civilisation
i
ask
of
the
north
what
of
their
white
brethren
in
the
south
those
who
have
suffered
and
are
still
suffering
the
consequences
of
american
slavery
for
which
both
north
and
south
were
responsible
those
of
the
great
and
prosperous
north
still
owe
to
their
less
fortunate
brethren
of
the
caucasian
race
in
the
south
not
less
than
to
themselves
a
serious
and
uncompleted
duty
what
was
the
task
the
north
asked
the
south
to
perform
returning
to
their
destitute
homes
after
years
of
war
to
face
blasted
hopes
devastation
a
shattered
industrial
system
they
asked
them
to
add
to
their
own
burdens
that
of
preparing
in
education
politics
and
economics
in
a
few
short
years
for
citizenship
four
millions
of
former
slaves
that
the
south
staggering
under
the
burden
made
blunders
and
that
in
a
measure
there
has
been
disappointment
no
one
need
be
surprised
the
educators
the
statesmen
the
philanthropists
have
imperfectly
comprehended
their
duty
toward
the
millions
of
poor
whites
in
the
south
who
were
buffeted
for
two
hundred
years
between
slavery
and
freedom
between
civilisation
and
degradation
who
were
disregarded
by
both
master
and
slave
it
needs
no
prophet
to
tell
the
character
of
our
future
civilisation
when
the
poor
white
boy
in
the
country
districts
of
the
south
receives
one
dollar
worth
of
education
and
the
boy
of
the
same
class
in
the
north
twenty
dollars
worth
when
one
never
enters
a
or
library
and
the
other
has
and
libraries
in
every
ward
and
town
when
one
hears
lectures
and
sermons
once
in
two
months
and
the
other
can
hear
a
lecture
or
a
sermon
every
day
in
the
year
the
time
has
come
it
seems
to
me
when
in
this
matter
we
should
rise
above
party
or
race
or
sectionalism
into
the
region
of
duty
of
man
to
man
of
citizen
to
citizen
of
christian
to
christian
and
if
the
negro
who
has
been
oppressed
and
denied
his
rights
in
a
christian
land
can
help
the
whites
of
the
north
and
south
to
rise
can
be
the
inspiration
of
their
rising
into
this
atmosphere
of
generous
christian
brotherhood
and
he
will
see
in
it
a
recompense
for
all
that
he
has
suffered
in
the
past
chapter
iii
in
the
heart
of
the
black
belt
of
the
south
in
days
there
was
a
large
estate
with
palatial
mansion
surrounded
by
a
beautiful
grove
in
which
grew
flowers
and
shrubbery
of
every
description
magnificent
specimens
of
animal
life
grazed
in
the
fields
and
in
grain
and
all
manner
of
plant
growth
this
estate
was
a
model
in
a
word
it
was
the
highest
type
of
the
product
of
slave
labor
then
came
the
long
years
of
war
then
freedom
then
the
trying
years
of
reconstruction
the
master
returned
from
the
war
to
find
the
faithful
slaves
who
had
been
the
bulwark
of
this
household
in
possession
of
their
freedom
then
there
began
that
social
and
industrial
revolution
in
the
south
which
it
is
hard
for
any
who
was
not
really
a
part
of
it
to
appreciate
or
understand
gradually
day
by
day
this
began
to
realise
with
a
feeling
almost
indescribable
to
what
an
extent
he
and
his
family
had
grown
to
be
dependent
upon
the
activity
and
faithfulness
of
his
slaves
began
to
appreciate
to
what
an
extent
slavery
had
sapped
his
sinews
of
strength
and
independence
how
his
dependence
upon
slave
labour
had
deprived
him
and
his
offspring
of
the
benefit
of
technical
and
industrial
training
and
worst
of
all
had
unconsciously
led
him
to
see
in
labour
drudgery
and
degradation
instead
of
beauty
dignity
and
civilising
power
at
first
there
was
a
halt
in
this
man
life
he
cursed
the
north
and
he
cursed
the
negro
then
there
was
despair
almost
utter
hopelessness
over
his
weak
and
childlike
condition
the
temptation
was
to
forget
all
in
drink
and
to
this
temptation
there
was
a
gradual
yielding
with
the
loss
of
physical
vigour
came
the
loss
of
mental
grasp
and
pride
in
surroundings
there
was
the
falling
off
of
a
piece
of
plaster
from
the
walls
of
the
house
which
was
not
replaced
then
another
and
still
another
gradually
the
began
to
disappear
then
the
touches
of
paint
and
whitewash
which
once
helped
to
give
life
were
no
more
to
be
seen
the
hinges
disappeared
from
the
gate
then
a
board
from
the
fence
then
others
in
quick
succession
weeds
and
unmown
grass
covered
the
once
lawn
sometimes
there
were
servants
for
domestic
duties
and
sometimes
there
were
none
in
the
absence
of
servants
the
unsatisfactory
condition
of
the
food
told
that
it
was
being
prepared
by
hands
unschooled
to
such
duties
as
the
years
passed
by
debts
accumulated
in
every
direction
the
education
of
the
children
was
neglected
lower
and
lower
sank
the
industrial
financial
and
spiritual
condition
of
the
household
for
the
first
time
the
awful
truth
of
scripture
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
seemed
to
dawn
upon
him
with
a
reality
that
it
is
hard
for
mortal
to
appreciate
within
a
few
months
the
whole
mistake
of
slavery
seemed
to
have
concentrated
itself
upon
this
household
and
this
was
one
of
many
we
have
seen
how
the
ending
of
slavery
and
the
beginning
of
freedom
produced
not
only
a
shock
but
a
and
in
many
cases
a
collapse
that
lasted
several
years
in
the
life
of
many
white
men
if
the
sudden
change
thus
affected
the
white
man
should
this
not
teach
us
that
we
should
have
more
sympathy
than
has
been
shown
in
many
cases
with
the
negro
in
connection
with
his
new
and
changed
life
that
they
made
many
mistakes
plunged
into
excesses
undertook
responsibilities
for
which
they
were
not
fitted
in
many
cases
took
liberty
to
mean
license
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
next
forty
years
are
going
to
show
by
many
per
cent
a
higher
degree
of
progress
in
the
life
of
the
negro
along
all
lines
than
has
been
shown
during
the
first
thirty
years
of
his
life
certainly
the
first
thirty
years
of
the
negro
life
was
one
of
experiment
and
consequently
under
such
conditions
he
was
not
able
to
settle
down
to
real
earnest
hard
common
sense
efforts
to
better
his
condition
while
this
was
true
in
a
great
many
cases
on
the
other
hand
a
large
proportion
of
the
race
even
from
the
first
saw
what
was
needed
for
their
new
life
and
began
to
settle
down
to
lead
an
industrious
frugal
existence
and
to
educate
their
children
and
in
every
way
prepare
themselves
for
the
responsibilities
of
american
citizenship
the
wonder
is
that
the
negro
has
made
as
few
mistakes
as
he
has
when
we
consider
all
the
surrounding
circumstances
columns
of
figures
have
been
gleaned
from
the
census
reports
within
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
to
show
the
great
amount
of
crime
committed
by
the
negro
in
excess
of
that
committed
by
other
races
no
one
will
deny
the
fact
that
the
proportion
of
crime
by
the
present
generation
of
negroes
is
seriously
large
but
i
believe
that
any
other
race
with
the
history
and
present
environment
would
have
shown
about
the
same
criminal
record
another
consideration
which
we
must
always
bear
in
mind
in
considering
the
negro
is
that
he
had
practically
no
home
life
in
slavery
that
is
the
mother
and
father
did
not
have
the
responsibility
and
consequently
the
experience
of
training
their
own
children
the
matter
of
child
training
was
left
to
the
master
and
mistress
consequently
it
has
only
been
within
the
last
thirty
years
that
the
negro
parents
have
had
the
actual
responsibility
and
experience
of
training
their
own
children
that
they
have
made
some
mistakes
in
thus
training
them
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
many
families
scattered
over
all
parts
of
the
united
states
have
not
yet
been
able
to
bring
themselves
together
when
the
negro
parents
shall
have
had
thirty
or
forty
additional
years
in
which
to
found
homes
and
get
experience
in
the
training
of
their
children
i
believe
that
we
will
find
that
the
amount
of
crime
will
be
considerably
less
than
it
is
now
shown
to
be
in
too
large
a
measure
the
negro
race
began
its
development
at
the
wrong
end
simply
because
neither
white
nor
black
understood
the
case
and
no
wonder
for
there
had
never
been
such
a
case
in
the
history
of
the
world
to
show
where
this
primary
mistake
has
led
in
its
evil
results
i
wish
to
produce
some
examples
showing
plainly
how
prone
we
have
been
to
make
our
education
formal
superficial
instead
of
making
it
meet
the
needs
of
conditions
in
order
to
emphasise
the
matter
more
fully
i
repeat
at
least
eighty
per
cent
of
the
coloured
people
in
the
south
are
found
in
the
rural
districts
and
they
are
dependent
on
agriculture
in
some
form
for
their
support
notwithstanding
that
we
have
practically
a
whole
race
dependent
upon
agriculture
and
notwithstanding
that
thirty
years
have
passed
since
our
freedom
aside
from
what
has
been
done
at
hampton
and
tuskegee
and
one
or
two
other
institutions
but
very
little
has
been
attempted
by
state
or
philanthropy
in
the
way
of
educating
the
race
in
this
one
industry
upon
which
its
very
existence
depends
boys
have
been
taken
from
the
farms
and
educated
in
law
theology
hebrew
and
greek
educated
in
everything
else
except
the
very
subject
that
they
should
know
most
about
i
question
whether
among
all
the
educated
coloured
people
in
the
united
states
you
can
find
six
if
we
except
those
from
the
institutions
named
who
have
received
anything
like
a
thorough
training
in
agriculture
it
would
have
seemed
that
since
industrial
independence
is
the
first
condition
for
lifting
up
any
race
that
education
in
theoretical
and
practical
agriculture
horticulture
dairying
and
should
have
occupied
the
first
place
in
our
system
some
time
ago
when
we
decided
to
make
tailoring
a
part
of
our
training
at
the
tuskegee
institute
i
was
amazed
to
find
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
find
in
the
whole
country
an
educated
coloured
man
who
could
teach
the
making
of
clothing
we
could
find
them
by
the
score
who
could
teach
astronomy
theology
grammar
or
latin
but
almost
none
who
could
instruct
in
the
making
of
clothing
something
that
has
to
be
used
by
every
one
of
us
every
day
in
the
year
how
often
has
my
heart
been
made
to
sink
as
i
have
gone
through
the
south
and
into
the
homes
of
people
and
found
women
who
could
converse
intelligently
on
grecian
history
who
had
studied
geometry
could
analyse
the
most
complex
sentences
and
yet
could
not
analyse
the
poorly
cooked
and
still
more
poorly
served
corn
bread
and
fat
meat
that
they
and
their
families
were
eating
three
times
a
day
it
is
little
trouble
to
find
girls
who
can
locate
pekin
or
the
desert
of
sahara
on
an
artificial
globe
but
seldom
can
you
find
one
who
can
locate
on
an
actual
dinner
table
the
proper
place
for
the
carving
knife
and
fork
or
the
meat
and
vegetables
a
short
time
ago
in
one
of
the
southern
cities
a
coloured
man
died
who
had
received
training
as
a
skilled
mechanic
during
the
days
of
slavery
later
by
his
skill
and
industry
he
built
up
a
great
business
as
a
house
contractor
and
builder
in
this
same
city
there
are
coloured
people
among
them
young
men
who
have
been
well
educated
in
the
languages
and
in
literature
but
not
a
single
one
could
be
found
who
had
been
so
trained
in
mechanical
and
architectural
drawing
that
he
could
carry
on
the
business
which
this
had
built
up
and
so
it
was
soon
scattered
to
the
wind
aside
from
the
work
done
in
the
institutions
that
i
have
mentioned
you
can
find
almost
no
coloured
men
who
have
been
trained
in
the
principles
of
architecture
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
vast
majority
of
our
race
are
without
homes
here
then
are
the
three
prime
conditions
for
growth
for
civilisation
food
clothing
shelter
and
yet
we
have
been
the
slaves
of
forms
and
customs
to
such
an
extent
that
we
have
failed
in
a
large
measure
to
look
matters
squarely
in
the
face
and
meet
actual
needs
it
may
well
be
asked
by
one
who
has
not
carefully
considered
the
matter
what
has
become
of
all
those
skilled
that
used
to
be
on
the
old
plantations
where
are
those
wonderful
cooks
we
hear
about
where
those
exquisitely
trained
house
servants
those
cabinet
makers
and
the
that
were
the
pride
of
the
south
this
is
easily
answered
they
are
mostly
dead
the
survivors
are
too
old
to
work
but
did
they
not
train
their
children
is
the
natural
question
alas
the
answer
is
no
their
skill
was
so
commonplace
to
them
and
to
their
former
masters
that
neither
thought
of
it
as
being
a
or
desirable
accomplishment
it
was
natural
like
breathing
their
children
would
have
it
as
a
matter
of
course
what
their
children
needed
was
education
so
they
went
out
into
the
world
the
ambitious
ones
and
got
education
and
forgot
the
necessity
of
the
ordinary
training
to
live
god
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
in
my
opinion
prepared
the
way
for
the
redemption
of
the
negro
through
industrial
development
first
he
made
the
southern
white
man
do
business
with
the
negro
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
in
a
way
that
no
one
else
has
done
business
with
him
if
a
southern
white
man
wanted
a
house
or
a
bridge
built
he
consulted
a
negro
mechanic
about
the
plan
and
about
the
actual
building
of
the
house
or
bridge
if
he
wanted
a
suit
of
clothes
or
a
pair
of
shoes
made
it
was
to
the
negro
tailor
or
shoemaker
that
he
talked
secondly
every
large
slave
plantation
in
the
south
was
in
a
limited
sense
an
industrial
school
on
these
plantations
there
were
scores
of
young
coloured
men
and
women
who
were
constantly
being
trained
not
alone
as
common
farmers
but
as
carpenters
blacksmiths
wheelwrights
plasterers
brick
masons
engineers
cooks
dressmakers
housekeepers
etc
i
would
be
the
last
to
apologise
for
the
curse
of
slavery
but
i
am
simply
stating
facts
this
training
was
crude
and
was
given
for
selfish
purposes
and
did
not
answer
the
highest
ends
because
there
was
the
absence
of
brain
training
in
connection
with
that
of
the
hand
nevertheless
this
business
contact
with
the
southern
white
man
and
the
industrial
training
received
on
these
plantations
put
the
negro
at
the
close
of
the
war
into
possession
of
all
the
common
and
skilled
labour
in
the
south
for
nearly
twenty
years
after
the
war
except
in
one
or
two
cases
the
value
of
the
industrial
training
given
by
the
former
masters
on
the
plantations
and
elsewhere
was
overlooked
negro
men
and
women
were
educated
in
literature
mathematics
and
the
sciences
with
no
thought
of
what
had
taken
place
on
these
plantations
for
two
and
a
half
centuries
after
twenty
years
those
who
were
trained
as
mechanics
during
slavery
began
to
disappear
by
death
and
gradually
we
awoke
to
the
fact
that
we
had
no
one
to
take
their
places
we
had
scores
of
young
men
learned
in
greek
but
few
in
carpentry
or
mechanical
or
architectural
drawing
we
had
trained
many
in
latin
but
almost
none
as
engineers
and
machinists
numbers
were
taken
from
the
farm
and
educated
but
were
educated
in
everything
else
except
agriculture
hence
they
had
no
sympathy
with
farm
life
and
did
not
return
to
it
this
last
that
i
have
been
saying
is
practically
a
repetition
of
what
i
have
said
in
the
preceding
paragraph
but
to
emphasise
it
and
this
point
is
one
of
the
most
important
i
wish
to
impress
on
the
reader
it
is
well
to
repeat
to
say
the
same
thing
twice
oh
if
only
more
who
had
the
shaping
of
the
education
of
the
negro
could
have
thirty
years
ago
realised
and
made
others
realise
where
the
forgetting
of
the
years
of
manual
training
and
the
sudden
acquiring
of
education
were
going
to
lead
the
negro
race
what
a
saving
it
would
have
been
how
much
less
my
race
would
have
had
to
answer
for
as
well
as
the
white
but
it
is
too
late
to
cry
over
what
might
have
been
it
is
time
to
make
up
as
soon
as
possible
for
this
mistake
time
for
both
races
to
acknowledge
it
and
go
forth
on
the
course
that
it
seems
to
me
all
must
now
see
to
be
the
right
one
industrial
education
as
an
example
of
what
a
and
educated
negro
may
now
do
and
how
ready
to
acknowledge
him
a
southern
white
man
may
be
let
me
return
once
more
to
the
plantation
i
spoke
of
in
the
first
part
of
this
chapter
as
the
years
went
by
the
night
seemed
to
grow
darker
so
that
all
seemed
hopeless
and
lost
at
this
point
relief
and
strength
came
from
an
unexpected
source
this
southern
white
idea
of
negro
education
had
been
that
it
merely
meant
a
absorption
of
civilisation
with
a
special
tendency
to
imitate
the
weaker
elements
of
the
white
man
character
that
it
meant
merely
the
high
hat
kid
gloves
a
showy
walking
cane
patent
leather
shoes
and
all
the
rest
of
it
to
this
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
education
of
the
negro
could
produce
any
other
results
and
so
last
of
all
did
he
expect
help
or
encouragement
from
an
educated
black
man
but
it
was
just
from
this
source
that
help
came
soon
after
the
process
of
decay
began
in
this
white
estate
the
education
of
a
certain
black
man
began
and
began
on
a
logical
sensible
basis
it
was
an
education
that
would
fit
him
to
see
and
appreciate
the
physical
and
moral
conditions
that
existed
in
his
own
family
and
neighbourhood
and
in
the
present
generation
would
fit
him
to
apply
himself
to
their
relief
by
chance
this
educated
negro
strayed
into
the
employ
of
this
white
man
his
employer
soon
learned
that
this
negro
not
only
had
a
knowledge
of
science
mathematics
and
literature
in
his
head
but
in
his
hands
as
well
this
black
man
applied
his
knowledge
of
agricultural
chemistry
to
the
redemption
of
the
soil
and
soon
the
washes
and
gulleys
began
to
disappear
and
the
waste
places
began
to
bloom
new
and
improved
machinery
in
a
few
months
began
to
rob
labour
of
its
toil
and
drudgery
the
animals
were
given
systematic
and
kindly
attention
fences
were
repaired
and
rebuilt
whitewash
and
paint
were
made
to
do
duty
everywhere
order
slowly
began
to
replace
confusion
hope
despair
and
profits
losses
as
he
observed
day
by
day
new
life
and
strength
being
imparted
to
every
department
of
his
property
this
white
son
of
the
south
began
revising
his
own
creed
regarding
the
wisdom
of
educating
negroes
hitherto
his
creed
regarding
the
value
of
an
educated
negro
had
been
rather
a
plain
and
simple
one
and
read
the
only
end
that
could
be
accomplished
by
educating
a
black
man
was
to
enable
him
to
talk
properly
to
a
mule
and
the
negro
education
did
great
injustice
to
the
mule
since
the
language
tended
to
confuse
him
and
make
him
balky
we
need
not
continue
the
story
except
to
add
that
the
grasp
of
the
hand
of
this
and
the
listening
to
his
hearty
words
of
gratitude
and
commendation
for
the
education
of
the
negro
are
enough
to
compensate
those
who
have
given
and
those
who
have
worked
and
sacrificed
for
the
elevation
of
my
people
through
all
of
these
years
if
we
are
patient
wise
unselfish
and
courageous
such
examples
will
multiply
as
the
years
go
by
before
closing
this
chapter
which
i
think
has
clearly
shown
that
there
is
at
present
a
very
distinct
lack
of
industrial
training
in
the
south
among
the
negroes
i
wish
to
say
a
few
words
in
regard
to
certain
objections
or
rather
misunderstandings
which
have
from
time
to
time
arisen
in
regard
to
the
matter
many
have
had
the
thought
that
industrial
training
was
meant
to
make
the
negro
work
much
as
he
worked
during
the
days
of
slavery
this
is
far
from
my
idea
of
it
if
this
training
has
any
value
for
the
negro
as
it
has
for
the
white
man
it
consists
in
teaching
the
negro
how
rather
not
to
work
but
how
to
make
the
forces
of
nature
air
water
steam
and
electric
power
work
for
him
how
to
lift
labour
up
out
of
toil
and
drudgery
into
that
which
is
dignified
and
beautiful
the
negro
in
the
south
works
and
he
works
hard
but
his
lack
of
skill
coupled
with
ignorance
causes
him
too
often
to
do
his
work
in
the
most
costly
and
shiftless
manner
and
this
has
kept
him
near
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
in
the
business
world
i
repeat
that
industrial
education
teaches
the
negro
how
not
to
drudge
in
his
work
let
him
who
doubts
this
contrast
the
negro
in
the
south
toiling
through
a
field
of
oats
with
an
reaper
with
the
white
man
on
a
modern
farm
in
the
west
sitting
upon
a
modern
harvester
behind
two
spirited
horses
with
an
umbrella
over
him
using
a
machine
that
cuts
and
binds
the
oats
at
the
same
time
doing
four
times
as
much
work
as
the
black
man
with
one
half
the
labour
let
us
give
the
black
man
so
much
skill
and
brains
that
he
can
cut
oats
like
the
white
man
then
he
can
compete
with
him
the
negro
works
in
cotton
and
has
no
trouble
so
long
as
his
labour
is
confined
to
the
lower
forms
of
work
the
planting
the
picking
and
the
ginning
but
when
the
negro
attempts
to
follow
the
bale
of
cotton
up
through
the
higher
stages
through
the
mill
where
it
is
made
into
the
finer
fabrics
where
the
larger
profit
appears
he
is
told
that
he
is
not
wanted
the
negro
can
work
in
wood
and
iron
and
no
one
objects
so
long
as
he
confines
his
work
to
the
felling
of
trees
and
sawing
of
boards
to
the
digging
of
iron
ore
and
making
of
pig
iron
but
when
the
negro
attempts
to
follow
this
tree
into
the
factory
where
it
is
made
into
desks
and
chairs
and
railway
coaches
or
when
he
attempts
to
follow
the
pig
iron
into
the
factory
where
it
is
made
into
and
the
negro
trouble
begins
and
what
is
the
objection
simply
that
the
negro
lacks
the
skill
coupled
with
brains
necessary
to
compete
with
the
white
man
or
that
when
white
men
refuse
to
work
with
coloured
men
enough
skilled
and
educated
coloured
men
can
not
be
found
able
to
superintend
and
man
every
part
of
any
one
large
industry
and
hence
for
these
reasons
they
are
constantly
being
barred
out
the
negro
must
become
in
a
larger
measure
an
intelligent
producer
as
well
as
a
consumer
there
should
be
a
more
vital
and
practical
connection
between
the
negro
educated
brain
and
his
opportunity
of
earning
his
daily
living
a
very
weak
argument
often
used
against
pushing
industrial
training
for
the
negro
is
that
the
southern
white
man
favours
it
and
therefore
it
is
not
best
for
the
negro
although
i
was
born
a
slave
i
am
thankful
that
i
am
able
so
far
to
rid
myself
of
prejudice
as
to
be
able
to
accept
a
good
thing
whether
it
comes
from
a
black
man
or
a
white
man
a
southern
man
or
a
northern
man
industrial
education
will
not
only
help
the
negro
directly
in
the
matter
of
industrial
development
but
also
in
bringing
about
more
satisfactory
relations
between
him
and
the
southern
white
man
for
the
sake
of
the
negro
and
the
southern
white
man
there
are
many
things
in
the
relation
of
the
two
races
that
must
soon
be
changed
we
can
not
depend
wholly
upon
abuse
or
condemnation
of
the
southern
white
man
to
bring
about
these
changes
each
race
must
be
educated
to
see
matters
in
a
broad
high
generous
christian
spirit
we
must
bring
the
two
races
together
not
estrange
them
the
negro
must
live
for
all
time
by
the
side
of
the
southern
white
man
the
man
is
unwise
who
does
not
cultivate
in
every
manly
way
the
friendship
and
good
will
of
his
neighbour
whether
he
be
black
or
white
i
repeat
that
industrial
training
will
help
cement
the
friendship
of
the
two
races
the
history
of
the
world
proves
that
trade
commerce
is
the
forerunner
of
peace
and
civilisation
as
between
races
and
nations
the
jew
who
was
once
in
about
the
same
position
that
the
negro
is
has
now
recognition
because
he
has
entwined
himself
about
america
in
a
business
and
industrial
sense
say
or
think
what
we
will
it
is
the
tangible
or
visible
element
that
is
going
to
tell
largely
during
the
next
twenty
years
in
the
solution
of
the
race
problem
chapter
iv
one
of
the
main
problems
as
regards
the
education
of
the
negro
is
how
to
have
him
use
his
education
to
the
best
advantage
after
he
has
secured
it
in
saying
this
i
do
not
want
to
be
understood
as
implying
that
the
problem
of
simple
ignorance
among
the
masses
has
been
settled
in
the
south
for
this
is
far
from
true
the
amount
of
ignorance
still
prevailing
among
the
negroes
especially
in
the
rural
districts
is
very
large
and
serious
but
i
repeat
we
must
go
farther
if
we
would
secure
the
best
results
and
most
gratifying
returns
in
public
good
for
the
money
spent
than
merely
to
put
academic
education
in
the
head
with
the
idea
that
this
will
settle
everything
in
his
present
condition
it
is
important
in
seeking
after
what
he
terms
the
ideal
that
the
negro
should
not
neglect
to
prepare
himself
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
are
right
about
his
door
if
he
lets
these
opportunities
slip
i
fear
they
will
never
be
his
again
in
saying
this
i
mean
always
that
the
negro
should
have
the
most
thorough
mental
and
religious
training
for
without
it
no
race
can
succeed
because
of
his
past
history
and
environment
and
present
condition
it
is
important
that
he
be
carefully
guided
for
years
to
come
in
the
proper
use
of
his
education
much
valuable
time
has
been
lost
and
money
spent
in
vain
because
too
many
have
not
been
educated
with
the
idea
of
fitting
them
to
do
well
the
things
which
they
could
get
to
do
because
of
the
lack
of
proper
direction
of
the
education
some
good
friends
of
his
north
and
south
have
not
taken
that
interest
in
it
that
they
otherwise
would
have
taken
in
too
many
cases
where
merely
literary
education
alone
has
been
given
the
negro
youth
it
has
resulted
in
an
exaggerated
estimate
of
his
importance
in
the
world
and
an
increase
of
wants
which
his
education
has
not
fitted
him
to
supply
but
in
discussing
this
subject
one
is
often
met
with
the
question
should
not
the
negro
be
encouraged
to
prepare
himself
for
any
station
in
life
that
any
other
race
fills
i
would
say
yes
but
the
surest
way
for
the
negro
to
reach
the
highest
positions
is
to
prepare
himself
to
fill
well
at
the
present
time
the
basic
occupations
this
will
give
him
a
foundation
upon
which
to
stand
while
securing
what
is
called
the
more
exalted
positions
the
negro
has
the
right
to
study
law
but
success
will
come
to
the
race
sooner
if
it
produces
intelligent
thrifty
farmers
mechanics
and
housekeepers
to
support
the
lawyers
the
want
of
proper
direction
of
the
use
of
the
negro
education
results
in
tempting
too
many
to
live
mainly
by
their
wits
without
producing
anything
that
is
of
real
value
to
the
world
let
me
quote
examples
of
this
hayti
santo
domingo
and
liberia
although
among
the
richest
countries
in
natural
resources
in
the
world
are
discouraging
examples
of
what
must
happen
to
any
people
who
lack
industrial
or
technical
training
it
is
said
that
in
liberia
there
are
no
wagons
wheelbarrows
or
public
roads
showing
very
plainly
that
there
is
a
painful
absence
of
public
spirit
and
thrift
what
is
true
of
liberia
is
also
true
in
a
measure
of
the
republics
of
hayti
and
santo
domingo
the
people
have
not
yet
learned
the
lesson
of
turning
their
education
toward
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
and
the
making
of
the
simplest
implements
for
agricultural
and
other
forms
of
labour
much
would
have
been
done
toward
laying
a
sound
foundation
for
general
prosperity
if
some
attention
had
been
spent
in
this
direction
general
education
itself
has
no
bearing
on
the
subject
at
issue
because
while
there
is
no
public
school
system
in
either
of
these
countries
yet
large
numbers
of
men
of
both
hayti
and
santo
domingo
have
been
educated
in
france
for
generations
this
is
especially
true
of
hayti
the
education
has
been
altogether
in
the
direction
of
however
and
practically
little
in
the
direction
of
industrial
and
scientific
education
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
hayti
has
to
send
abroad
even
to
secure
engineers
for
her
for
plans
for
her
bridges
and
other
work
requiring
technical
knowledge
and
skill
i
should
very
much
regret
to
see
any
such
condition
obtain
in
any
large
measure
as
regards
the
coloured
people
in
the
south
and
yet
this
will
be
our
fate
if
industrial
education
is
much
longer
neglected
we
have
spent
much
time
in
the
south
in
educating
men
and
women
in
letters
alone
too
and
must
now
turn
our
attention
more
than
ever
toward
educating
them
so
as
to
supply
their
wants
and
needs
it
is
more
lamentable
to
see
educated
people
unable
to
support
themselves
than
to
see
uneducated
people
in
the
same
condition
ambition
all
along
this
line
must
be
stimulated
if
educated
men
and
women
of
the
race
will
see
and
acknowledge
the
necessity
of
practical
industrial
training
and
go
to
work
with
a
zeal
and
determination
their
example
will
be
followed
by
others
who
are
now
without
ambition
of
any
kind
the
race
can
not
hope
to
come
into
its
own
until
the
young
coloured
men
and
women
make
up
their
minds
to
assist
in
the
general
development
along
these
lines
the
elder
men
and
women
trained
in
the
hard
school
of
slavery
and
who
so
long
possessed
all
of
the
labour
skilled
and
unskilled
of
the
south
are
dying
out
their
places
must
be
filled
by
their
children
or
we
shall
lose
our
hold
upon
these
occupations
leaders
in
these
occupations
are
needed
now
more
than
ever
it
is
not
enough
that
the
idea
be
inculcated
that
coloured
people
should
get
book
learning
along
with
it
they
should
be
taught
that
book
education
and
industrial
development
must
go
hand
in
hand
no
race
which
fails
to
do
this
can
ever
hope
to
succeed
phillips
brooks
gave
expression
to
the
sentiment
one
generation
gathers
the
material
and
the
next
generation
builds
the
palaces
as
i
understand
it
he
wished
to
inculcate
the
idea
that
one
generation
lays
the
foundation
for
succeeding
generations
the
rough
affairs
of
life
very
largely
fall
to
the
earlier
generation
while
the
next
one
has
the
privilege
of
dealing
with
the
higher
and
more
æsthetic
things
of
life
this
is
true
of
all
generations
of
all
peoples
and
unless
the
foundation
is
deeply
laid
it
is
impossible
for
the
succeeding
one
to
have
a
career
in
any
way
approaching
success
as
regards
the
coloured
men
of
the
south
as
regards
the
coloured
men
of
the
united
states
this
is
the
generation
which
in
a
large
measure
must
gather
the
material
with
which
to
lay
the
foundation
for
future
success
some
time
ago
it
was
my
misfortune
to
see
a
negro
years
old
living
in
poverty
and
filth
i
was
disgusted
and
said
to
him
if
you
are
worthy
of
your
freedom
you
would
surely
have
changed
your
condition
during
the
thirty
years
of
freedom
which
you
have
enjoyed
he
answered
i
do
want
to
change
i
want
to
do
something
for
my
wife
and
children
but
i
do
not
know
how
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
i
looked
into
his
lean
and
haggard
face
and
realised
more
deeply
than
ever
before
the
absolute
need
of
captains
of
industry
among
the
great
masses
of
the
coloured
people
it
is
possible
for
a
race
or
an
individual
to
have
mental
development
and
yet
be
so
handicapped
by
custom
prejudice
and
lack
of
employment
as
to
dwarf
and
discourage
the
whole
life
this
is
the
condition
that
prevails
among
the
race
in
many
of
the
large
cities
of
the
north
and
it
is
to
prevent
this
same
condition
in
the
south
that
i
plead
with
all
the
earnestness
of
my
heart
mental
development
alone
will
not
give
us
what
we
want
but
mental
development
tied
to
hand
and
heart
training
will
be
the
salvation
of
the
negro
in
many
respects
the
next
twenty
years
are
going
to
be
the
most
serious
in
the
history
of
the
race
within
this
period
it
will
be
largely
decided
whether
the
negro
will
be
able
to
retain
the
hold
which
he
now
has
upon
the
industries
of
the
south
or
whether
his
place
will
be
filled
by
white
people
from
a
distance
the
only
way
he
can
prevent
the
industrial
occupations
slipping
from
him
in
all
parts
of
the
south
as
they
have
already
in
certain
parts
is
for
all
educators
ministers
and
friends
of
the
race
to
unite
in
pushing
forward
in
a
manner
the
industrial
or
business
development
of
the
negro
whether
in
school
or
out
of
school
four
times
as
many
young
men
and
women
of
the
race
should
be
receiving
industrial
training
just
now
the
negro
is
in
a
position
to
feel
and
appreciate
the
need
of
this
in
a
way
that
no
one
else
can
no
one
can
fully
appreciate
what
i
am
saying
who
has
not
walked
the
streets
of
a
northern
city
day
after
day
seeking
employment
only
to
find
every
door
closed
against
him
on
account
of
his
colour
except
in
menial
service
it
is
to
prevent
the
same
thing
taking
place
in
the
south
that
i
plead
we
may
argue
that
mental
development
will
take
care
of
all
this
mental
development
is
a
good
thing
gold
is
also
a
good
thing
but
gold
is
worthless
without
an
opportunity
to
make
itself
touch
the
world
of
trade
education
increases
greatly
an
wants
it
is
cruel
in
many
cases
to
increase
the
wants
of
the
black
youth
by
mental
development
alone
without
at
the
same
time
increasing
his
ability
to
supply
these
increased
wants
in
occupations
in
which
he
can
find
employment
the
place
made
vacant
by
the
death
of
the
old
coloured
man
who
was
trained
as
a
carpenter
during
slavery
and
who
since
the
war
had
been
the
leading
contractor
and
builder
in
the
southern
town
had
to
be
filled
no
young
coloured
carpenter
capable
of
filling
his
place
could
be
found
the
result
was
that
his
place
was
filled
by
a
white
mechanic
from
the
north
or
from
europe
or
from
elsewhere
what
is
true
of
carpentry
and
in
this
case
is
true
in
a
degree
in
every
skilled
occupation
and
it
is
becoming
true
of
common
labour
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
of
the
skilled
labour
has
been
taken
out
of
the
negro
hands
but
i
do
mean
to
say
that
in
no
part
of
the
south
is
he
so
strong
in
the
matter
of
skilled
labour
as
he
was
twenty
years
ago
except
possibly
in
the
country
districts
and
the
smaller
towns
in
the
more
northern
of
the
southern
cities
such
as
richmond
and
baltimore
the
change
is
most
apparent
and
it
is
being
felt
in
every
southern
city
wherever
the
negro
has
lost
ground
industrially
in
the
south
it
is
not
because
there
is
prejudice
against
him
as
a
skilled
labourer
on
the
part
of
the
native
southern
white
man
the
southern
white
man
generally
prefers
to
do
business
with
the
negro
mechanic
rather
than
with
a
white
one
because
he
is
accustomed
to
do
business
with
the
negro
in
this
respect
there
is
almost
no
prejudice
against
the
negro
in
the
south
in
matters
of
business
so
far
as
the
native
whites
are
concerned
and
here
is
the
entering
wedge
for
the
solution
of
the
race
problem
but
too
often
where
the
white
mechanic
or
factory
operative
from
the
north
gets
a
hold
the
soon
follows
and
the
negro
is
crowded
to
the
wall
but
what
is
the
remedy
for
this
condition
first
it
is
most
important
that
the
negro
and
his
white
friends
honestly
face
the
facts
as
they
are
otherwise
the
time
will
not
be
very
far
distant
when
the
negro
of
the
south
will
be
crowded
to
the
ragged
edge
of
industrial
life
as
he
is
in
the
north
there
is
still
time
to
repair
the
damage
and
to
reclaim
what
we
have
lost
i
stated
in
the
beginning
that
industrial
education
for
the
negro
has
been
misunderstood
this
has
been
chiefly
because
some
have
gotten
the
idea
that
industrial
development
was
opposed
to
the
negro
higher
mental
development
this
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
under
discussion
we
should
no
longer
permit
such
an
idea
to
aid
in
depriving
the
negro
of
the
legacy
in
the
form
of
skilled
labour
that
was
purchased
by
his
forefathers
at
the
price
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
slavery
i
would
say
to
the
black
boy
what
i
would
say
to
the
white
boy
get
all
the
mental
development
that
your
time
and
will
allow
of
the
more
the
better
but
the
time
has
come
when
a
larger
proportion
not
all
for
we
need
professional
men
and
women
of
the
educated
coloured
men
and
women
should
give
themselves
to
industrial
or
business
life
the
professional
class
will
be
helped
in
so
far
as
the
rank
and
file
have
an
industrial
foundation
so
that
they
can
pay
for
professional
service
whether
they
receive
the
training
of
the
hand
while
pursuing
their
academic
training
or
after
their
academic
training
is
finished
or
whether
they
will
get
their
literary
training
in
an
industrial
school
or
college
are
questions
which
each
individual
must
decide
for
himself
no
matter
how
or
where
educated
the
educated
men
and
women
must
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
race
in
the
effort
to
get
and
hold
its
industrial
footing
i
would
not
have
the
standard
of
mental
development
lowered
one
whit
for
with
the
negro
as
with
all
races
mental
strength
is
the
basis
of
all
progress
but
i
would
have
a
large
measure
of
this
mental
strength
reach
the
negroes
actual
needs
through
the
medium
of
the
hand
just
now
the
need
is
not
so
much
for
the
common
carpenters
brick
masons
farmers
and
laundry
women
as
for
industrial
leaders
who
in
addition
to
their
practical
knowledge
can
draw
plans
make
estimates
take
contracts
those
who
understand
the
latest
methods
of
and
the
science
underlying
practical
agriculture
those
who
understand
machinery
to
the
extent
that
they
can
operate
steam
and
electric
laundries
so
that
our
women
can
hold
on
to
the
laundry
work
in
the
south
that
is
so
fast
drifting
into
the
hands
of
others
in
the
large
cities
and
towns
having
tried
to
show
in
previous
chapters
to
what
a
condition
the
lack
of
practical
training
has
brought
matters
in
the
south
and
by
the
examples
in
this
chapter
where
this
state
of
things
may
go
if
allowed
to
run
its
course
i
wish
now
to
show
what
practical
training
even
in
its
infancy
among
us
has
already
accomplished
i
noticed
when
i
first
went
to
tuskegee
to
start
the
tuskegee
normal
and
industrial
institute
that
some
of
the
white
people
about
there
rather
looked
doubtfully
at
me
and
i
thought
i
could
get
their
influence
by
telling
them
how
much
algebra
and
history
and
science
and
all
those
things
i
had
in
my
head
but
they
treated
me
about
the
same
as
they
did
before
they
did
seem
to
care
about
the
algebra
history
and
science
that
were
in
my
head
only
those
people
never
even
began
to
have
confidence
in
me
until
we
commenced
to
build
a
large
brick
building
and
then
another
and
another
until
now
we
have
forty
buildings
which
have
been
erected
largely
by
the
labour
of
our
students
and
we
have
the
respect
and
confidence
of
all
the
white
people
in
that
section
there
is
an
unmistakable
influence
that
comes
over
a
white
man
when
he
sees
a
black
man
living
in
a
brick
house
that
has
been
paid
for
i
need
not
stop
to
explain
it
is
the
tangible
evidence
of
prosperity
you
know
thomas
doubted
the
saviour
after
he
had
risen
from
the
dead
and
the
lord
said
to
thomas
reach
hither
thy
finger
and
behold
my
hands
and
reach
hither
thy
hand
and
thrust
it
into
my
side
the
tangible
evidence
convinced
thomas
we
began
soon
after
going
to
tuskegee
the
manufacture
of
bricks
we
also
started
a
wheelwright
establishment
and
the
manufacture
of
good
wagons
and
buggies
and
the
white
people
came
to
our
institution
for
that
kind
of
work
we
also
put
in
a
printing
plant
and
did
job
printing
for
the
white
people
as
well
as
for
the
blacks
by
having
something
that
these
people
wanted
we
came
into
contact
with
them
and
our
interest
became
interlinked
with
their
interest
until
we
have
no
warmer
friends
anywhere
in
the
country
than
we
have
among
the
white
people
of
tuskegee
we
have
found
by
experience
that
the
best
way
to
get
on
well
with
people
is
to
have
something
that
they
want
and
that
is
why
we
emphasise
this
christian
industrial
education
not
long
ago
i
heard
a
conversation
among
three
white
men
something
like
this
two
of
them
were
berating
the
negro
saying
the
negro
was
shiftless
and
lazy
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
the
third
man
listened
to
their
remarks
for
some
time
in
silence
and
then
he
said
i
do
know
what
your
experience
has
been
but
there
is
a
down
our
way
who
owns
a
good
house
and
lot
with
about
fifty
acres
of
ground
his
house
is
well
furnished
and
he
has
got
some
splendid
horses
and
cattle
he
is
intelligent
and
has
a
bank
account
i
know
how
the
are
in
your
community
but
tobe
jones
is
a
gentleman
once
when
i
was
hard
up
i
went
to
tobe
jones
and
borrowed
fifty
dollars
and
he
has
asked
me
for
it
yet
i
do
know
what
kind
of
you
have
down
your
way
but
tobe
jones
is
a
gentleman
now
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
multiply
and
place
in
every
community
these
tobe
joneses
and
just
in
so
far
as
we
can
place
them
throughout
the
south
this
race
question
will
disappear
suppose
there
was
a
black
man
who
had
business
for
the
railroads
to
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
dollars
a
year
do
you
suppose
that
when
that
black
man
takes
his
family
aboard
the
train
they
are
going
to
put
him
into
a
jim
crow
car
and
run
the
risk
of
losing
that
ten
thousand
dollars
a
year
no
they
will
put
on
a
pullman
palace
car
for
him
some
time
ago
a
certain
coloured
man
was
passing
through
the
streets
of
one
of
the
little
southern
towns
and
he
chanced
to
meet
two
white
men
on
the
street
it
happened
that
this
coloured
man
owns
two
or
three
houses
and
lots
has
a
good
education
and
a
comfortable
bank
account
one
of
the
white
men
turned
to
the
other
and
said
by
gosh
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
keep
from
calling
that
mister
the
point
we
want
to
get
to
nothing
else
so
soon
brings
about
right
relations
between
the
two
races
in
the
south
as
the
commercial
progress
of
the
negro
friction
between
the
races
will
pass
away
as
the
black
man
by
reason
of
his
skill
intelligence
and
character
can
produce
something
that
the
white
man
wants
or
respects
in
the
commercial
world
this
is
another
reason
why
at
tuskegee
we
push
industrial
training
we
find
that
as
every
year
we
put
into
a
southern
community
coloured
men
who
can
start
a
brickyard
a
a
or
a
men
who
produce
something
that
makes
the
white
man
partly
dependent
upon
the
negro
instead
of
all
the
dependence
being
on
the
other
side
a
change
for
the
better
takes
place
in
the
relations
of
the
races
it
is
through
the
dairy
farm
the
the
trades
the
commercial
life
largely
that
the
negro
is
to
find
his
way
to
respect
and
confidence
what
is
the
permanent
value
of
the
hampton
and
tuskegee
system
of
training
to
the
south
in
a
broader
sense
in
connection
with
this
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
slavery
unconsciously
taught
the
white
man
that
labour
with
the
hands
was
something
fit
for
the
negro
only
and
something
for
the
white
man
to
come
into
contact
with
just
as
little
as
possible
it
is
true
that
there
was
a
large
class
of
poor
white
people
who
laboured
with
the
hands
but
they
did
it
because
they
were
not
able
to
secure
negroes
to
work
for
them
and
these
poor
whites
were
constantly
trying
to
imitate
the
slaveholding
class
in
escaping
labour
as
they
too
regarded
it
as
anything
but
elevating
but
the
negro
in
turn
looked
down
upon
the
poor
whites
with
a
certain
contempt
because
they
had
to
work
the
negro
it
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
worked
under
constant
protest
because
he
felt
that
his
labour
was
being
unjustly
requited
and
he
spent
almost
as
much
effort
in
planning
how
to
escape
work
as
in
learning
how
to
work
labour
with
him
was
a
badge
of
degradation
the
white
man
was
held
up
before
him
as
the
highest
type
of
civilisation
but
the
negro
noted
that
this
highest
type
of
civilisation
himself
did
little
labour
with
the
hand
hence
he
argued
that
the
less
work
he
did
the
more
nearly
he
would
be
like
the
white
man
then
in
addition
to
these
influences
the
slave
system
discouraged
machinery
to
use
machinery
intelligence
was
required
and
intelligence
and
slavery
were
not
on
friendly
terms
hence
the
negro
always
associated
labour
with
toil
drudgery
something
to
be
escaped
when
the
negro
first
became
free
his
idea
of
education
was
that
it
was
something
that
would
soon
put
him
in
the
same
position
as
regards
work
that
his
recent
master
had
occupied
out
of
these
conditions
grew
the
habit
of
putting
off
till
and
the
day
after
the
duty
that
should
be
done
promptly
the
leaky
house
was
not
repaired
while
the
sun
shone
for
then
the
rain
did
not
come
through
while
the
rain
was
falling
no
one
cared
to
expose
himself
to
stop
the
rain
the
plough
on
the
same
principle
was
left
where
the
last
furrow
was
run
to
rot
and
rust
in
the
field
during
the
winter
there
was
no
need
to
repair
the
wooden
chimney
that
was
exposed
to
the
fire
because
water
could
be
thrown
on
it
when
it
was
on
fire
there
was
no
need
to
trouble
about
the
payment
of
a
debt
because
it
could
be
paid
as
well
next
week
or
next
year
besides
these
conditions
the
whole
south
at
the
close
of
the
war
was
without
proper
food
clothing
and
shelter
was
in
need
of
habits
of
thrift
and
economy
and
of
something
laid
up
for
a
rainy
day
to
me
it
seemed
perfectly
plain
that
here
was
a
condition
of
things
that
could
not
be
met
by
the
ordinary
process
of
education
at
tuskegee
we
became
convinced
that
the
thing
to
do
was
to
make
a
careful
systematic
study
of
the
condition
and
needs
of
the
south
especially
the
black
belt
and
to
bend
our
efforts
in
the
direction
of
meeting
these
needs
whether
we
were
following
a
track
or
were
hewing
out
a
new
path
to
meet
conditions
probably
without
a
parallel
in
the
world
after
eighteen
years
of
experience
and
observation
what
is
the
result
gradually
but
surely
we
find
that
all
through
the
south
the
disposition
to
look
upon
labour
as
a
disgrace
is
on
the
wane
and
the
parents
who
themselves
sought
to
escape
work
are
so
anxious
to
give
their
children
training
in
intelligent
labour
that
every
institution
which
gives
training
in
the
handicrafts
is
crowded
and
many
among
them
tuskegee
have
to
refuse
admission
to
hundreds
of
applicants
the
influence
of
hampton
and
tuskegee
is
shown
again
by
the
fact
that
almost
every
little
school
at
the
remotest
is
anxious
to
be
known
as
an
industrial
school
or
as
some
of
the
coloured
people
call
it
an
industrous
school
the
social
lines
that
were
once
sharply
drawn
between
those
who
laboured
with
the
hands
and
those
who
did
not
are
disappearing
those
who
formerly
sought
to
escape
labour
now
when
they
see
that
brains
and
skill
rob
labour
of
the
toil
and
drudgery
once
associated
with
it
instead
of
trying
to
avoid
it
are
willing
to
pay
to
be
taught
how
to
engage
in
it
the
south
is
beginning
to
see
labour
raised
up
dignified
and
beautified
and
in
this
sees
its
salvation
in
proportion
as
the
love
of
labour
grows
the
large
idle
class
which
has
long
been
one
of
the
curses
of
the
south
disappears
as
people
become
absorbed
in
their
own
affairs
they
have
less
time
to
attend
to
everybody
else
business
the
south
is
still
an
undeveloped
and
unsettled
country
and
for
the
next
and
more
the
greater
part
of
the
energy
of
the
masses
will
be
needed
to
develop
its
material
resources
any
force
that
brings
the
rank
and
file
of
the
people
to
have
a
greater
love
of
industry
is
therefore
especially
valuable
this
result
industrial
education
is
surely
bringing
about
it
stimulates
production
and
increases
trade
trade
between
the
races
and
in
this
new
and
engrossing
relation
both
forget
the
past
the
white
man
respects
the
vote
of
a
coloured
man
who
does
ten
thousand
dollars
worth
of
business
and
the
more
business
the
coloured
man
has
the
more
careful
he
is
how
he
votes
immediately
after
the
war
there
was
a
large
class
of
southern
people
who
feared
that
the
opening
of
the
free
schools
to
the
freedmen
and
the
poor
whites
the
education
of
the
head
alone
would
result
merely
in
increasing
the
class
who
sought
to
escape
labour
and
that
the
south
would
soon
be
overrun
by
the
idle
and
vicious
but
as
the
results
of
industrial
combined
with
academic
training
begin
to
show
themselves
in
hundreds
of
communities
that
have
been
lifted
up
these
former
prejudices
against
education
are
being
removed
many
of
those
who
a
few
years
ago
opposed
negro
education
are
now
among
its
warmest
advocates
this
industrial
training
emphasising
as
it
does
the
idea
of
economic
production
is
gradually
bringing
the
south
to
the
point
where
it
is
feeding
itself
after
the
war
what
profit
the
south
made
out
of
the
cotton
crop
it
spent
outside
of
the
south
to
purchase
food
supplies
meat
bread
canned
vegetables
and
the
like
but
the
improved
methods
of
agriculture
are
fast
changing
this
custom
with
the
newer
methods
of
labour
which
teach
promptness
and
system
and
emphasise
the
worth
of
the
beautiful
the
moral
value
of
the
house
the
fence
with
every
paling
and
nail
in
its
place
is
bringing
to
bear
upon
the
south
an
influence
that
is
making
it
a
new
country
in
industry
education
and
religion
it
seems
to
me
i
can
not
do
better
than
to
close
this
chapter
on
the
needs
of
the
southern
negro
than
by
quoting
from
a
talk
given
to
the
students
at
tuskegee
i
want
to
be
a
little
more
specific
in
showing
you
what
you
have
to
do
and
how
you
must
do
it
one
trouble
with
us
is
and
the
same
is
true
of
any
young
people
no
matter
of
what
race
or
condition
we
have
too
many
we
step
all
the
time
from
one
thing
to
another
you
find
a
young
man
who
is
learning
to
make
bricks
and
if
you
ask
him
what
he
intends
to
do
after
learning
the
trade
in
too
many
cases
he
will
answer
i
am
simply
working
at
this
trade
as
a
to
something
higher
you
see
a
young
man
working
at
the
trade
and
he
will
be
apt
to
say
the
same
thing
and
young
women
learning
to
be
milliners
and
dressmakers
will
tell
you
the
same
all
are
stepping
to
something
higher
and
so
we
always
go
on
stepping
somewhere
never
getting
hold
of
anything
thoroughly
now
we
must
stop
this
stepping
business
having
so
many
instead
we
have
got
to
take
hold
of
these
important
industries
and
stick
to
them
until
we
master
them
thoroughly
there
is
no
nation
so
thorough
in
their
education
as
the
germans
why
simply
because
the
german
takes
hold
of
a
thing
and
sticks
to
it
until
he
masters
it
into
it
he
puts
brains
and
thought
from
morning
to
night
he
reads
all
the
best
books
and
journals
bearing
on
that
particular
study
and
he
feels
that
nobody
else
knows
so
much
about
it
as
he
does
take
any
of
the
industries
i
have
mentioned
that
of
for
example
any
one
working
at
that
trade
should
determine
to
learn
all
there
is
to
be
known
about
making
bricks
read
all
the
papers
and
journals
bearing
upon
the
trade
learn
not
only
to
make
common
but
pressed
bricks
in
short
the
finest
and
best
bricks
there
are
to
be
made
and
when
you
have
learned
all
you
can
by
reading
and
talking
with
other
people
you
should
travel
from
one
city
to
another
and
learn
how
the
best
bricks
are
made
and
then
when
you
go
into
business
for
yourself
you
will
make
a
reputation
for
being
the
best
in
the
community
and
in
this
way
you
will
put
yourself
on
your
feet
and
become
a
helpful
and
useful
citizen
when
a
young
man
does
this
goes
out
into
one
of
these
southern
cities
and
makes
a
reputation
for
himself
that
person
wins
a
reputation
that
is
going
to
give
him
a
standing
and
position
and
when
the
children
of
that
successful
come
along
they
will
be
able
to
take
a
higher
position
in
life
the
grandchildren
will
be
able
to
take
a
still
higher
position
and
it
will
be
traced
back
to
that
grandfather
who
by
his
great
success
as
a
laid
a
foundation
that
was
of
the
right
kind
what
i
have
said
about
these
two
trades
can
be
applied
with
equal
force
to
the
trades
followed
by
women
take
the
matter
of
millinery
there
is
no
good
reason
why
there
should
not
be
in
each
principal
city
in
the
south
at
least
three
or
four
competent
coloured
women
in
charge
of
millinery
establishments
but
what
is
the
trouble
instead
of
making
the
most
of
our
opportunities
in
this
industry
the
temptation
in
too
many
cases
is
to
be
teachers
of
elocution
or
something
else
that
few
of
the
race
at
present
have
any
money
to
pay
for
or
the
opportunity
to
earn
money
to
pay
for
simply
because
there
is
no
foundation
but
when
more
coloured
people
succeed
in
the
more
fundamental
occupations
they
will
then
be
able
to
make
better
provision
for
their
children
in
what
are
termed
the
higher
walks
of
life
and
now
what
i
have
said
about
these
important
industries
is
especially
true
of
the
important
industry
of
agriculture
we
are
living
in
a
country
where
if
we
are
going
to
succeed
at
all
we
are
going
to
do
so
largely
by
what
we
raise
out
of
the
soil
the
people
in
those
backward
countries
i
have
told
you
about
have
failed
to
give
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
to
the
invention
and
use
of
improved
agricultural
implements
and
machinery
without
this
no
people
can
succeed
no
race
which
fails
to
put
brains
into
agriculture
can
succeed
and
if
you
want
to
realize
the
truth
of
this
statement
go
with
me
into
the
back
districts
of
some
of
our
southern
states
and
you
will
find
many
people
in
poverty
and
yet
they
are
surrounded
by
a
rich
country
a
race
like
an
individual
has
got
to
have
a
reputation
such
a
reputation
goes
a
long
way
toward
helping
a
race
or
an
individual
and
when
we
have
succeeded
in
getting
such
a
reputation
we
shall
find
that
a
great
many
of
the
discouraging
features
of
our
life
will
melt
away
reputation
is
what
people
think
we
are
and
a
great
deal
depends
on
that
when
a
race
gets
a
reputation
along
certain
lines
a
great
many
things
which
now
seem
complex
difficult
to
attain
and
are
most
discouraging
will
disappear
when
you
say
that
an
engine
is
a
corliss
engine
people
understand
that
that
engine
is
a
perfect
piece
of
mechanical
work
perfect
as
far
as
human
skill
and
ingenuity
can
make
it
perfect
you
say
a
car
is
a
pullman
car
that
is
all
but
what
does
it
mean
it
means
that
the
builder
of
that
car
got
a
reputation
at
the
outset
for
thorough
perfect
work
for
turning
out
everything
in
shape
and
so
with
a
race
you
can
not
keep
back
very
long
a
race
that
has
the
reputation
for
doing
perfect
work
in
everything
that
it
undertakes
and
then
we
have
got
to
get
a
reputation
for
economy
nobody
cares
to
associate
with
an
individual
in
business
or
otherwise
who
has
a
reputation
for
being
a
trifling
spendthrift
who
spends
his
money
for
things
that
he
can
very
easily
get
along
without
who
spends
his
money
for
clothing
gewgaws
superficialities
and
other
things
when
he
has
not
got
the
necessaries
of
life
we
want
to
give
the
race
a
reputation
for
being
frugal
and
saving
in
everything
then
we
want
to
get
a
reputation
for
being
industrious
now
remember
these
three
things
get
a
reputation
for
being
skilled
it
will
not
do
for
a
few
here
and
there
to
have
it
the
race
must
have
the
reputation
get
a
reputation
for
being
so
skilful
so
industrious
that
you
will
not
leave
a
job
until
it
is
as
nearly
perfect
as
any
one
can
make
it
and
then
we
want
to
make
a
reputation
for
the
race
for
being
honest
honest
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
a
few
individuals
here
and
there
have
it
a
few
communities
have
it
but
the
race
as
a
mass
must
get
it
you
recall
that
story
of
abraham
lincoln
how
when
he
was
postmaster
at
a
small
village
he
had
left
on
his
hands
which
the
government
did
not
call
for
carefully
wrapping
up
this
money
in
a
handkerchief
he
kept
it
for
ten
years
finally
one
day
the
government
agent
called
for
this
amount
and
it
was
promptly
handed
over
to
him
by
abraham
lincoln
who
told
him
that
during
all
those
ten
years
he
had
never
touched
a
cent
of
that
money
he
made
it
a
principle
of
his
life
never
to
use
other
people
money
that
trait
of
his
character
helped
him
along
to
the
presidency
the
race
wants
to
get
a
reputation
for
being
strictly
honest
in
all
its
dealings
and
transactions
honest
in
handling
money
honest
in
all
its
dealings
with
its
and
then
we
want
to
get
a
reputation
for
being
thoughtful
this
i
want
to
emphasise
more
than
anything
else
we
want
to
get
a
reputation
for
doing
things
without
being
told
to
do
them
every
time
if
you
have
work
to
do
think
about
it
so
constantly
investigate
and
read
about
it
so
thoroughly
that
you
will
always
be
finding
ways
and
means
of
improving
that
work
the
average
person
going
to
work
becomes
a
regular
machine
never
giving
the
matter
of
improving
the
methods
of
his
work
a
thought
he
is
never
at
his
work
before
the
appointed
time
and
is
sure
to
stop
the
minute
the
hour
is
up
the
world
is
looking
for
the
person
who
is
thoughtful
who
will
say
at
the
close
of
work
hours
there
not
something
else
i
can
do
for
you
can
i
not
stay
a
little
later
and
help
you
moreover
it
is
with
a
race
as
it
is
with
an
individual
it
must
respect
itself
if
it
would
win
the
respect
of
others
there
must
be
a
certain
amount
of
unity
about
a
race
there
must
be
a
great
amount
of
pride
about
a
race
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
faith
on
the
part
of
a
race
in
itself
an
individual
can
not
succeed
unless
he
has
about
him
a
certain
amount
of
pride
enough
pride
to
make
him
aspire
to
the
highest
and
best
things
in
life
an
individual
can
not
succeed
unless
that
individual
has
a
great
amount
of
faith
in
himself
a
person
who
goes
at
an
undertaking
with
the
feeling
that
he
can
not
succeed
is
likely
to
fail
on
the
other
hand
the
individual
who
goes
at
an
undertaking
feeling
that
he
can
succeed
is
the
individual
who
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
does
succeed
but
whenever
you
find
an
individual
that
is
ashamed
of
his
race
trying
to
get
away
from
his
race
apologising
for
being
a
member
of
his
race
then
you
find
a
weak
individual
where
you
find
a
race
that
is
ashamed
of
itself
that
is
apologising
for
itself
there
you
will
find
a
weak
vacillating
race
let
us
no
longer
have
to
apologise
for
our
race
in
these
or
other
matters
let
us
think
seriously
and
work
seriously
then
as
a
race
we
shall
be
thought
of
seriously
and
therefore
seriously
respected
chapter
in
this
chapter
i
wish
to
show
how
at
tuskegee
we
are
trying
to
work
out
the
plan
of
industrial
training
and
trust
i
shall
be
pardoned
the
seeming
egotism
if
i
preface
the
sketch
with
a
few
words
by
way
of
example
as
to
the
expansion
of
my
own
life
and
how
i
came
to
undertake
the
work
at
tuskegee
my
earliest
recollection
is
of
a
small
log
hut
on
a
slave
plantation
in
virginia
after
the
close
of
the
war
while
working
in
the
coal
mines
of
west
virginia
for
the
support
of
my
mother
i
heard
in
some
accidental
way
of
the
hampton
institute
when
i
learned
that
it
was
an
institution
where
a
black
boy
could
study
could
have
a
chance
to
work
for
his
board
and
at
the
same
time
be
taught
how
to
work
and
to
realise
the
dignity
of
labor
i
resolved
to
go
there
bidding
my
mother
i
started
out
one
morning
to
find
my
way
to
hampton
although
i
was
almost
penniless
and
had
no
definite
idea
as
to
where
hampton
was
by
walking
begging
rides
and
paying
for
a
portion
of
the
journey
on
the
i
finally
succeeded
in
reaching
the
city
of
richmond
virginia
i
was
without
money
or
friends
i
slept
on
a
sidewalk
and
by
working
on
a
vessel
the
next
day
i
earned
money
enough
to
continue
my
way
to
the
institute
where
i
arrived
with
a
capital
of
fifty
cents
at
hampton
i
found
the
opportunity
in
the
way
of
buildings
teachers
and
industries
provided
by
the
generous
to
get
training
in
the
classroom
and
by
practical
touch
with
industrial
life
to
learn
thrift
economy
and
push
i
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
business
christian
influence
and
spirit
of
that
seemed
to
have
awakened
every
faculty
in
me
and
caused
me
for
the
first
time
to
realise
what
it
meant
to
be
a
man
instead
of
a
piece
of
property
while
there
i
resolved
when
i
had
finished
the
course
of
training
i
would
go
into
the
far
south
into
the
black
belt
of
the
south
and
give
my
life
to
providing
the
same
kind
of
opportunity
for
that
i
had
found
provided
for
me
at
hampton
my
work
began
at
tuskegee
alabama
in
in
a
small
shanty
church
with
one
teacher
and
thirty
students
without
a
dollar
worth
of
property
the
spirit
of
work
and
of
industrial
thrift
with
aid
from
the
state
and
generosity
from
the
north
have
enabled
us
to
develop
an
institution
which
now
has
about
one
thousand
students
gathered
from
states
and
instructors
counting
students
instructors
and
their
families
we
have
a
resident
population
upon
the
school
grounds
of
about
twelve
hundred
persons
the
institution
owns
two
thousand
three
hundred
acres
of
land
seven
hundred
of
which
are
cultivated
by
student
labor
there
are
six
hundred
head
of
including
horses
mules
cows
hogs
and
sheep
there
are
over
forty
vehicles
that
have
been
made
and
are
now
used
by
the
school
training
is
given
in
industries
there
is
work
in
wood
in
iron
in
leather
in
tin
and
all
forms
of
domestic
economy
are
engaged
in
students
are
taught
mechanical
and
architectural
drawing
receive
training
as
agriculturists
dairymen
masons
carpenters
contractors
builders
as
machinists
electricians
printers
dressmakers
and
milliners
and
in
other
directions
the
value
of
the
property
is
there
are
buildings
counting
large
and
small
all
of
which
with
the
exception
of
four
have
been
erected
by
the
labour
of
the
students
since
this
work
started
there
has
been
collected
and
spent
for
its
founding
and
support
the
annual
expense
is
now
not
far
from
in
a
humble
simple
manner
the
effort
has
been
to
place
a
great
in
the
heart
of
the
south
for
the
elevation
of
the
coloured
people
where
there
should
be
in
a
high
sense
that
union
of
head
heart
and
hand
which
has
been
the
foundation
of
the
greatness
of
all
races
since
the
world
began
what
is
the
object
of
all
this
outlay
it
must
be
first
borne
in
mind
that
we
have
in
the
south
a
peculiar
and
unprecedented
state
of
things
the
cardinal
needs
among
the
eight
million
coloured
people
in
the
south
most
of
whom
are
to
be
found
on
the
plantations
may
be
stated
as
food
clothing
shelter
education
proper
habits
and
a
settlement
of
race
relations
these
millions
of
coloured
people
of
the
south
can
not
be
reached
directly
by
any
missionary
agent
but
they
can
be
reached
by
sending
out
among
them
strong
selected
young
men
and
women
with
the
proper
training
of
head
hand
and
heart
who
will
live
among
them
and
show
them
how
to
lift
themselves
up
the
problem
that
the
tuskegee
institute
keeps
before
itself
constantly
is
how
to
prepare
these
leaders
from
the
outset
in
connection
with
religious
and
academic
training
it
has
emphasised
industrial
or
hand
training
as
a
means
of
finding
the
way
out
of
present
conditions
first
we
have
found
the
industrial
teaching
useful
in
giving
the
student
a
chance
to
work
out
a
portion
of
his
expenses
while
in
school
second
the
school
furnishes
labour
that
has
an
economic
value
and
at
the
same
time
gives
the
student
a
chance
to
acquire
knowledge
and
skill
while
performing
the
labour
most
of
all
we
find
the
industrial
system
valuable
in
teaching
economy
thrift
and
the
dignity
of
labour
and
in
giving
moral
backbone
to
students
the
fact
that
a
student
goes
into
the
world
conscious
of
his
power
to
build
a
house
or
a
wagon
or
to
make
a
set
of
harness
gives
him
a
certain
confidence
and
moral
independence
that
he
would
not
possess
without
such
training
a
more
detailed
example
of
our
methods
at
tuskegee
may
be
of
interest
for
example
we
cultivate
by
student
labour
seven
hundred
acres
of
land
the
object
is
not
only
to
cultivate
the
land
in
a
way
to
make
it
pay
our
boarding
department
but
at
the
same
time
to
teach
the
students
in
addition
to
the
practical
work
something
of
the
chemistry
of
the
soil
the
best
methods
of
drainage
dairying
cultivation
of
fruit
the
care
of
and
tools
and
scores
of
other
lessons
needed
by
people
whose
main
dependence
is
on
agriculture
friends
some
time
ago
provided
means
for
the
erection
of
a
large
new
chapel
at
tuskegee
our
students
made
the
bricks
for
this
chapel
a
large
part
of
the
timber
was
sawed
by
the
students
at
our
the
plans
were
drawn
by
our
teacher
of
architectural
and
mechanical
drawing
and
students
did
the
the
plastering
the
painting
the
carpentry
work
the
tinning
the
slating
and
made
most
of
the
furniture
practically
the
whole
chapel
was
built
and
furnished
by
student
labour
now
the
school
has
this
building
for
permanent
use
and
the
students
have
a
knowledge
of
the
trades
employed
in
its
construction
while
the
young
men
do
the
kinds
of
work
i
have
mentioned
young
women
to
a
large
extent
make
mend
and
laundry
the
clothing
of
the
young
men
they
also
receive
instruction
in
dairying
horticulture
and
other
valuable
industries
one
of
the
objections
sometimes
urged
against
industrial
education
for
the
negro
is
that
it
aims
merely
to
teach
him
to
work
on
the
same
plan
that
he
worked
on
when
in
slavery
this
is
far
from
being
the
object
at
tuskegee
at
the
head
of
each
of
the
industrial
divisions
we
have
an
intelligent
and
competent
instructor
just
as
we
have
in
our
history
classes
so
that
the
student
is
taught
not
only
practical
for
example
but
also
the
underlying
principles
of
that
industry
the
mathematics
and
the
mechanical
and
architectural
drawing
or
he
is
taught
how
to
become
master
of
the
forces
of
nature
so
that
instead
of
cultivating
corn
in
the
old
way
he
can
use
a
corn
cultivator
that
lays
off
the
furrows
drops
the
corn
into
them
and
covers
it
and
in
this
way
he
can
do
more
work
than
three
men
by
the
old
process
of
corn
planting
while
at
the
same
time
much
of
the
toil
is
eliminated
and
labour
is
dignified
in
a
word
the
constant
aim
is
to
show
the
student
how
to
put
brains
into
every
process
of
labour
how
to
bring
his
knowledge
of
mathematics
and
the
sciences
in
farming
carpentry
forging
foundry
work
how
to
dispense
as
soon
as
possible
with
the
old
form
of
labour
in
the
erection
of
the
chapel
referred
to
instead
of
letting
the
money
which
was
given
to
us
go
into
outside
hands
we
made
it
accomplish
three
objects
first
it
provided
the
chapel
second
it
gave
the
students
a
chance
to
get
a
practical
knowledge
of
the
trades
connected
with
the
building
and
third
it
enabled
them
to
earn
something
toward
the
payment
of
their
board
while
receiving
academic
and
industrial
training
having
been
fortified
at
tuskegee
by
education
of
mind
skill
of
hand
christian
character
ideas
of
thrift
economy
and
push
and
a
spirit
of
independence
the
student
is
sent
out
to
become
a
centre
of
influence
and
light
in
showing
the
masses
of
our
people
in
the
black
belt
of
the
south
how
to
lift
themselves
up
can
this
be
done
i
give
but
one
or
two
examples
ten
years
ago
a
young
coloured
man
came
to
the
institute
from
one
of
the
large
plantation
districts
he
studied
in
the
a
portion
of
the
time
and
received
practical
and
theoretical
training
on
the
farm
the
remainder
of
the
time
having
finished
his
course
at
tuskegee
he
returned
to
his
plantation
home
which
was
in
a
county
where
the
coloured
people
outnumbered
the
whites
six
to
one
as
is
true
of
many
of
the
counties
in
the
black
belt
of
the
south
he
found
the
negroes
in
debt
ever
since
the
war
they
had
been
mortgaging
their
crops
for
the
food
on
which
to
live
while
the
crops
were
growing
the
majority
of
them
were
living
from
on
rented
land
in
small
log
cabins
and
attempting
to
pay
a
rate
of
interest
on
their
advances
that
ranged
from
fifteen
to
forty
per
cent
per
annum
the
school
had
been
taught
in
a
wreck
of
a
log
cabin
with
no
apparatus
and
had
never
been
in
session
longer
than
three
months
out
of
twelve
he
found
the
people
as
many
as
eight
or
ten
persons
of
all
ages
and
conditions
and
of
both
sexes
huddled
together
and
living
in
cabins
year
after
year
and
with
a
minister
whose
only
aim
was
to
work
upon
the
emotions
one
can
imagine
something
of
the
moral
and
religious
state
of
the
community
but
the
remedy
in
spite
of
the
evil
the
negro
got
the
habit
of
work
from
slavery
the
rank
and
file
of
the
race
especially
those
on
the
southern
plantations
work
hard
but
the
trouble
is
that
what
they
earn
gets
away
from
them
in
high
rents
crop
mortgages
whiskey
snuff
cheap
jewelry
and
the
like
the
young
man
just
referred
to
had
been
trained
at
tuskegee
as
most
of
our
graduates
are
to
meet
just
this
condition
of
things
he
took
the
three
months
public
school
as
a
nucleus
for
his
work
then
he
organized
the
older
people
into
a
club
or
conference
that
held
meetings
every
week
in
these
meetings
he
taught
the
people
in
a
plain
simple
manner
how
to
save
their
money
how
to
farm
in
a
better
way
how
to
sacrifice
to
live
on
bread
and
potatoes
if
necessary
till
they
could
get
out
of
debt
and
begin
the
buying
of
lands
soon
a
large
proportion
of
the
people
were
in
a
condition
to
make
contracts
for
the
buying
of
homes
land
is
very
cheap
in
the
south
and
to
live
without
mortgaging
their
crops
not
only
this
under
the
guidance
and
leadership
of
this
teacher
the
first
year
that
he
was
among
them
they
learned
how
and
built
by
contributions
in
money
and
labour
a
neat
comfortable
that
replaced
the
wreck
of
a
log
cabin
formerly
used
the
following
year
the
weekly
meetings
were
continued
and
two
months
were
added
to
the
original
three
months
of
school
the
next
year
two
more
months
were
added
the
improvement
has
gone
on
until
these
people
have
every
year
an
eight
months
school
i
wish
my
readers
could
have
the
chance
that
i
have
had
of
going
into
this
community
i
wish
they
could
look
into
the
faces
of
the
people
and
see
them
beaming
with
hope
and
delight
i
wish
they
could
see
the
two
or
three
room
cottages
that
have
taken
the
place
of
the
usual
cabin
see
the
farms
and
the
religious
life
of
the
people
that
now
means
something
more
than
the
name
the
teacher
has
a
good
cottage
and
farm
that
serve
as
models
in
a
word
a
complete
revolution
has
been
wrought
in
the
industrial
educational
and
religious
life
of
this
whole
community
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
have
had
this
leader
this
guide
and
to
show
them
how
to
take
the
money
and
effort
that
had
hitherto
been
scattered
to
the
wind
in
mortgages
and
high
rents
in
whiskey
and
gewgaws
and
how
to
concentrate
it
in
the
direction
of
their
own
uplifting
one
community
on
its
feet
presents
an
for
the
adjoining
communities
and
soon
improvements
show
themselves
in
other
places
another
student
who
received
academic
and
industrial
training
at
tuskegee
established
himself
three
years
ago
as
a
blacksmith
and
wheelwright
in
a
community
and
in
addition
to
the
influence
of
his
successful
business
enterprise
he
is
fast
making
the
same
kind
of
changes
in
the
life
of
the
people
about
him
that
i
have
just
recounted
it
would
be
easy
for
me
to
fill
many
pages
describing
the
influence
of
the
tuskegee
graduates
in
every
part
of
the
south
we
keep
it
constantly
in
the
minds
of
our
students
and
graduates
that
the
industrial
or
material
condition
of
the
masses
of
our
people
must
be
improved
as
well
as
the
intellectual
before
there
can
be
any
permanent
change
in
their
moral
and
religious
life
we
find
it
a
pretty
hard
thing
to
make
a
good
christian
of
a
hungry
man
no
matter
how
much
our
people
get
happy
and
shout
in
church
if
they
go
home
at
night
from
church
hungry
they
are
tempted
to
find
something
to
eat
before
morning
this
is
a
principle
of
human
nature
and
is
not
confined
alone
to
the
negro
the
negro
has
within
him
immense
power
for
but
for
years
it
will
be
necessary
to
guide
him
and
stimulate
his
energies
the
recognition
of
this
power
led
us
to
organise
five
years
ago
what
is
known
as
the
tuskegee
negro
conference
a
gathering
that
meets
every
february
and
is
composed
of
about
eight
hundred
representatives
coloured
men
and
women
from
all
sections
of
the
black
belt
they
come
in
buggies
on
muleback
and
horseback
on
foot
by
railroad
some
travel
all
night
in
order
to
be
present
the
matters
considered
at
the
conference
are
those
that
the
coloured
people
have
it
in
their
own
power
to
control
such
as
the
evils
of
the
mortgage
system
the
cabin
buying
on
credit
the
importance
of
owning
a
home
and
of
putting
money
in
the
bank
how
to
build
and
prolong
the
school
term
and
to
improve
their
moral
and
religious
condition
as
a
single
example
of
the
results
one
delegate
reported
that
since
the
conference
was
started
seven
years
ago
eleven
people
in
his
neighbourhood
had
bought
homes
fourteen
had
gotten
out
of
debt
and
a
number
had
stopped
mortgaging
their
crops
moreover
a
had
been
built
by
the
people
themselves
and
the
school
term
had
been
extended
from
three
to
six
months
and
with
a
look
of
triumph
he
exclaimed
we
done
libin
in
de
ashes
besides
this
negro
conference
for
the
masses
of
the
people
we
now
have
a
gathering
at
the
same
time
known
as
the
tuskegee
conference
composed
of
the
officers
and
instructors
of
the
leading
coloured
schools
in
the
south
after
listening
to
the
story
of
the
conditions
and
needs
from
the
people
themselves
the
conference
finds
much
food
for
thought
and
discussion
let
me
repeat
from
its
beginning
this
institution
has
kept
in
mind
the
giving
of
thorough
mental
and
religious
training
along
with
such
industrial
training
as
would
enable
the
student
to
appreciate
the
dignity
of
labour
and
become
and
valuable
as
a
producing
factor
keeping
in
mind
the
occupations
open
in
the
south
to
the
average
man
of
the
race
this
institution
has
now
reached
the
point
where
it
can
begin
to
judge
of
the
value
of
its
work
as
seen
in
its
graduates
some
years
ago
we
noted
the
fact
for
example
that
there
was
quite
a
movement
in
many
parts
of
the
south
to
organise
and
start
dairies
soon
after
this
we
opened
a
dairy
school
where
a
number
of
young
men
could
receive
training
in
the
best
and
most
scientific
methods
of
dairying
at
present
we
have
calls
mainly
from
southern
white
men
for
twice
as
many
dairymen
as
we
are
able
to
supply
the
reports
indicate
that
our
young
men
are
giving
the
highest
satisfaction
and
are
fast
changing
and
improving
the
dairy
product
in
the
communities
where
they
labour
i
have
used
the
dairy
industry
simply
as
an
example
what
i
have
said
of
this
industry
is
true
in
a
larger
or
less
degree
of
the
others
i
can
not
but
believe
and
my
daily
observation
and
experience
confirm
me
in
it
that
as
we
continue
placing
men
and
women
of
intelligence
religion
modesty
conscience
and
skill
in
every
community
in
the
south
who
will
prove
by
actual
results
their
value
to
the
community
this
will
constitute
the
solution
for
many
of
the
present
political
and
sociological
difficulties
it
is
with
this
larger
and
more
comprehensive
view
of
improving
present
conditions
and
laying
the
foundation
wisely
that
the
tuskegee
normal
and
industrial
institute
is
training
men
and
women
as
teachers
and
industrial
leaders
over
four
hundred
students
have
finished
the
course
of
training
at
this
institution
and
are
now
scattered
throughout
the
south
doing
good
work
a
recent
investigation
shows
that
about
students
who
have
taken
only
a
partial
course
are
doing
commendable
work
one
young
man
who
was
able
to
remain
in
school
but
two
years
has
been
teaching
in
one
community
for
ten
years
during
this
time
he
has
built
a
new
extended
the
school
term
from
three
to
seven
months
and
has
bought
a
nice
farm
upon
which
he
has
erected
a
neat
cottage
the
example
of
this
young
man
has
inspired
many
of
the
coloured
people
in
this
community
to
follow
his
example
in
some
degree
and
this
is
one
of
many
such
examples
wherever
our
graduates
and
go
they
teach
by
precept
and
example
the
necessary
lesson
of
thrift
economy
and
and
friendship
between
the
races
chapter
vi
it
has
become
apparent
that
the
effort
to
put
the
rank
and
file
of
the
coloured
people
into
a
position
to
exercise
the
right
of
franchise
has
not
been
the
success
that
was
expected
in
those
portions
of
our
country
where
the
negro
is
found
in
large
numbers
either
the
negro
was
not
prepared
for
any
such
wholesale
exercise
of
the
ballot
as
our
recent
amendments
to
the
constitution
contemplated
or
the
american
people
were
not
prepared
to
assist
and
encourage
him
to
use
the
ballot
in
either
case
the
result
has
been
the
same
on
an
important
occasion
in
the
life
of
the
master
when
it
fell
to
him
to
pronounce
judgment
on
two
courses
of
action
these
memorable
words
fell
from
his
lips
and
mary
hath
chosen
the
better
part
this
was
the
supreme
test
in
the
case
of
an
individual
it
is
the
highest
test
in
the
case
of
a
race
or
a
nation
let
us
apply
this
test
to
the
american
negro
in
the
life
of
our
republic
when
he
has
had
the
opportunity
to
choose
has
it
been
the
better
or
worse
part
when
in
the
childhood
of
this
nation
the
negro
was
asked
to
submit
to
slavery
or
choose
death
and
extinction
as
did
the
aborigines
he
chose
the
better
part
that
which
perpetuated
the
race
when
in
the
negro
was
asked
to
decide
between
british
oppression
and
american
independence
we
find
him
choosing
the
better
part
and
crispus
attucks
a
negro
was
the
first
to
shed
his
blood
on
state
street
boston
that
the
white
american
might
enjoy
liberty
forever
though
his
race
remained
in
slavery
when
in
at
new
orleans
the
test
of
patriotism
came
again
we
find
the
negro
choosing
the
better
part
general
andrew
jackson
himself
testifying
that
no
heart
was
more
loyal
and
no
arm
was
more
strong
and
useful
in
defence
of
righteousness
when
the
long
and
memorable
struggle
came
between
union
and
separation
when
he
knew
that
victory
meant
freedom
and
defeat
his
continued
enslavement
although
enlisting
by
the
thousands
as
opportunity
presented
itself
to
fight
in
honourable
combat
for
the
cause
of
the
union
and
liberty
yet
when
the
suggestion
and
the
temptation
came
to
burn
the
home
and
massacre
wife
and
children
during
the
absence
of
the
master
in
battle
and
thus
insure
his
liberty
we
find
him
choosing
the
better
part
and
for
four
long
years
protecting
and
supporting
the
helpless
defenceless
ones
intrusted
to
his
care
when
during
our
war
with
spain
the
safety
and
honour
of
the
republic
were
threatened
by
a
foreign
foe
when
the
wail
and
anguish
of
the
oppressed
from
a
distant
isle
reached
our
ears
we
find
the
negro
forgetting
his
own
wrongs
forgetting
the
laws
and
customs
that
discriminate
against
him
in
his
own
country
and
again
choosing
the
better
part
and
if
any
one
would
know
how
he
acquitted
himself
in
the
field
at
santiago
let
him
apply
for
answer
to
shafter
and
roosevelt
and
wheeler
let
them
tell
how
the
negro
faced
death
and
laid
down
his
life
in
defence
of
honour
and
humanity
when
the
full
story
of
the
heroic
conduct
of
the
negro
in
the
war
has
been
heard
from
the
lips
of
northern
soldier
and
southern
soldier
from
and
then
shall
the
country
decide
whether
a
race
that
is
thus
willing
to
die
for
its
country
should
not
be
given
the
highest
opportunity
to
live
for
its
country
in
the
midst
of
all
the
complaints
of
suffering
in
the
camp
and
field
during
the
war
suffering
from
fever
and
hunger
where
is
the
official
or
citizen
that
has
heard
a
word
of
complaint
from
the
lips
of
a
black
soldier
the
only
request
that
came
from
the
negro
soldier
was
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
replace
the
white
soldier
when
heat
and
malaria
began
to
decimate
the
ranks
of
the
white
regiments
and
to
occupy
at
the
same
time
the
post
of
greater
danger
but
when
all
this
is
said
it
remains
true
that
the
efforts
on
the
part
of
his
friends
and
the
part
of
himself
to
share
actively
in
the
control
of
state
and
local
government
in
america
have
not
been
a
success
in
all
sections
what
are
the
causes
of
this
partial
failure
and
what
lessons
has
it
taught
that
we
may
use
in
regard
to
the
future
treatment
of
the
negro
in
america
in
my
mind
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
we
made
a
mistake
at
the
beginning
of
our
freedom
of
putting
the
emphasis
on
the
wrong
end
politics
and
the
holding
of
office
were
too
largely
emphasised
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
interest
i
believe
the
past
and
present
teach
but
one
lesson
to
the
friends
and
to
the
negro
himself
that
there
is
but
one
way
out
that
there
is
but
one
hope
of
solution
and
that
is
for
the
negro
in
every
part
of
america
to
resolve
from
henceforth
that
he
will
throw
aside
every
and
cling
only
to
essential
that
his
pillar
of
fire
by
night
and
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
shall
be
property
economy
education
and
christian
character
to
us
just
now
these
are
the
wheat
all
else
the
chaff
the
individual
or
race
that
owns
the
property
pays
the
taxes
possesses
the
intelligence
and
substantial
character
is
the
one
which
is
going
to
exercise
the
greatest
control
in
government
whether
he
lives
in
the
north
or
whether
he
lives
in
the
south
i
have
often
been
asked
the
cause
of
and
the
cure
for
the
riots
that
have
taken
place
recently
in
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
what
i
shall
say
will
answer
these
questions
in
a
satisfactory
way
nor
shall
i
attempt
to
narrow
my
expressions
to
a
mere
recital
of
what
has
taken
place
in
these
two
states
i
prefer
to
discuss
the
problem
in
a
broader
manner
november
in
the
first
place
in
politics
i
am
a
republican
but
have
always
refrained
from
activity
in
party
politics
and
expect
to
pursue
this
policy
in
the
future
so
in
this
connection
i
shall
refrain
as
i
always
have
done
from
entering
upon
any
discussion
of
mere
party
politics
what
i
shall
say
of
politics
will
bear
upon
the
race
problem
and
the
civilisation
of
the
south
in
the
larger
sense
in
no
case
would
i
permit
my
political
relations
to
stand
in
the
way
of
my
speaking
and
acting
in
the
manner
that
i
believe
would
be
for
the
permanent
interest
of
my
race
and
the
whole
south
in
the
negro
in
the
south
had
reached
the
point
of
greatest
activity
and
influence
in
public
life
so
far
as
the
mere
holding
of
elective
office
was
concerned
from
that
date
those
who
have
kept
up
with
the
history
of
the
south
have
noticed
that
the
negro
has
steadily
lost
in
the
number
of
elective
offices
held
in
saying
this
i
do
not
mean
that
the
negro
has
gone
backward
in
the
real
and
more
fundamental
things
of
life
on
the
contrary
he
has
gone
forward
faster
than
has
been
true
of
any
other
race
in
history
under
anything
like
similar
circumstances
if
we
can
answer
the
question
as
to
why
the
negro
has
lost
ground
in
the
matter
of
holding
elective
office
in
the
south
perhaps
we
shall
find
that
our
reply
will
prove
to
be
our
answer
also
as
to
the
cause
of
the
recent
riots
in
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
before
beginning
a
discussion
of
the
question
i
have
asked
i
wish
to
say
that
this
change
in
the
political
influence
of
the
negro
has
continued
from
year
to
year
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
for
a
long
time
he
was
protected
politically
by
force
of
federal
arms
and
the
most
rigid
federal
laws
and
still
more
effectively
perhaps
by
the
voice
and
influence
in
the
halls
of
legislation
of
such
advocates
of
the
rights
of
the
negro
race
as
thaddeus
stevens
charles
sumner
benjamin
butler
james
ashley
oliver
morton
carl
schurz
and
roscoe
conkling
and
on
the
stump
and
through
the
public
press
by
those
great
and
powerful
negroes
frederick
douglass
john
langston
blanche
bruce
john
lynch
pinchback
robert
browne
elliot
thomas
fortune
and
many
others
but
the
negro
has
continued
for
twenty
years
to
have
fewer
representatives
in
the
state
and
national
legislatures
the
reduction
has
continued
until
now
it
is
at
the
point
where
with
few
exceptions
he
is
without
representatives
in
the
bodies
of
the
state
and
of
the
nation
now
let
us
find
if
we
can
a
cause
for
this
the
negro
is
fond
of
saying
that
his
present
condition
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
state
and
federal
courts
have
not
sustained
the
laws
passed
for
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
his
people
but
i
think
we
shall
have
to
go
deeper
than
this
because
i
believe
that
all
agree
that
court
decisions
as
a
rule
represent
the
public
opinion
of
the
community
or
nation
creating
and
sustaining
the
court
at
the
beginning
of
his
freedom
it
was
unfortunate
that
those
of
the
white
race
who
won
the
political
confidence
of
the
negro
were
not
with
few
exceptions
men
of
such
high
character
as
would
lead
them
to
assist
him
in
laying
a
firm
foundation
for
his
development
their
main
purpose
appears
to
have
been
for
selfish
ends
in
too
many
instances
merely
to
control
his
vote
the
history
of
the
reconstruction
era
will
show
that
this
was
unfortunate
for
all
the
parties
in
interest
it
would
have
been
better
from
any
point
of
view
if
the
native
southern
white
man
had
taken
the
negro
at
the
beginning
of
his
freedom
into
his
political
confidence
and
exercised
an
influence
and
control
over
him
before
his
political
affections
were
alienated
the
average
southern
white
man
has
an
idea
that
if
the
negro
were
permitted
to
get
any
political
power
all
the
mistakes
of
the
reconstruction
period
would
be
repeated
he
forgets
or
ignores
the
fact
that
thirty
years
of
acquiring
education
and
property
and
character
have
produced
a
higher
type
of
black
man
than
existed
thirty
years
ago
but
to
be
more
specific
for
all
practical
purposes
there
are
two
political
parties
in
the
south
a
black
man
party
and
a
white
party
in
saying
this
i
do
not
mean
that
all
white
men
are
democrats
for
there
are
some
white
men
in
the
south
of
the
highest
character
who
are
republicans
and
there
are
a
few
negroes
in
the
south
of
the
highest
character
who
are
democrats
it
is
the
general
understanding
that
all
white
men
are
democrats
or
the
equivalent
and
that
all
black
men
are
republicans
so
long
as
the
colour
line
is
the
dividing
line
in
politics
so
long
will
there
be
trouble
the
white
man
feels
that
he
owns
most
of
the
property
furnishes
the
negro
most
of
his
employment
thinks
he
pays
most
of
the
taxes
and
has
had
years
of
experience
in
government
there
is
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
the
feeling
which
has
heretofore
governed
the
negro
that
to
be
manly
and
stand
by
his
race
he
must
oppose
the
southern
white
man
with
his
vote
has
had
much
to
do
with
intensifying
the
opposition
of
the
southern
white
man
to
him
the
southern
white
man
says
that
it
is
unreasonable
for
the
negro
to
come
to
him
in
a
large
measure
for
his
clothes
board
shelter
and
education
and
for
his
politics
to
go
to
men
a
thousand
miles
away
he
very
properly
argues
that
when
the
negro
votes
he
should
try
to
consult
the
interests
of
his
employer
just
as
the
pennsylvania
employee
tries
to
vote
for
the
interests
of
his
employer
further
that
much
of
the
education
which
has
been
given
the
negro
has
been
defective
in
not
preparing
him
to
love
labour
and
to
earn
his
living
at
some
special
industry
and
has
in
too
many
cases
resulted
in
tempting
him
to
live
by
his
wits
as
a
political
creature
or
by
trusting
to
his
influence
as
a
political
then
there
is
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
much
opposition
to
the
negro
in
politics
is
due
to
the
circumstance
that
the
southern
white
man
has
not
become
accustomed
to
seeing
the
negro
exercise
political
power
either
as
a
voter
or
as
an
again
we
want
to
bear
it
in
mind
that
the
south
has
not
yet
reached
the
point
where
there
is
that
strict
regard
for
the
enforcement
of
the
law
against
either
black
or
white
men
that
there
is
in
many
of
our
northern
and
western
states
this
laxity
in
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
in
general
and
especially
of
criminal
laws
makes
such
outbreaks
as
those
in
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
of
easy
occurrence
then
there
is
one
other
consideration
which
must
not
be
overlooked
it
is
the
common
opinion
of
almost
every
black
man
and
almost
every
white
man
that
nearly
everybody
who
has
had
anything
to
do
with
the
making
of
laws
bearing
upon
the
protection
of
the
negro
vote
has
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
all
the
black
men
for
all
time
will
vote
the
republican
ticket
and
that
all
the
white
men
in
the
south
will
vote
the
democratic
ticket
in
a
word
all
seem
to
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
two
races
are
always
going
to
oppose
each
other
in
their
voting
in
all
the
foregoing
statements
i
have
not
attempted
to
define
my
own
views
or
position
but
simply
to
describe
conditions
as
i
have
observed
them
that
might
throw
light
upon
the
cause
of
our
political
troubles
as
to
my
own
position
i
do
not
favour
the
negro
giving
up
anything
which
is
fundamental
and
which
has
been
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
it
is
not
best
for
him
to
relinquish
any
of
his
rights
nor
would
his
doing
so
be
best
for
the
southern
white
man
every
law
placed
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
placed
there
to
encourage
and
stimulate
the
highest
citizenship
if
the
negro
is
not
stimulated
and
encouraged
by
just
state
and
national
laws
to
become
the
highest
type
of
citizen
the
result
will
be
worse
for
the
southern
white
man
than
for
the
negro
take
the
state
of
south
carolina
for
example
where
nearly
of
the
population
are
negroes
unless
these
negroes
are
encouraged
by
just
election
laws
to
become
and
intelligent
producers
the
white
people
of
south
carolina
will
have
an
eternal
millstone
about
their
necks
in
an
open
letter
to
the
state
constitutional
convention
of
louisiana
i
wrote
i
am
no
politician
on
the
other
hand
i
have
always
advised
my
race
to
give
attention
to
acquiring
property
intelligence
and
character
as
the
necessary
bases
of
good
citizenship
rather
than
to
mere
political
agitation
but
the
question
upon
which
i
write
is
out
of
the
region
of
ordinary
politics
it
affects
the
civilisation
of
two
races
not
for
alone
but
for
a
very
long
time
to
come
since
the
war
no
state
has
had
such
an
opportunity
to
settle
for
all
time
the
race
question
so
far
as
it
concerns
politics
as
is
now
given
to
louisiana
will
your
convention
set
an
example
to
the
world
in
this
respect
will
louisiana
take
such
high
and
just
grounds
in
respect
to
the
negro
that
no
one
can
doubt
that
the
south
is
as
good
a
friend
to
him
as
he
possesses
elsewhere
in
all
this
gentlemen
of
the
convention
i
am
not
pleading
for
the
negro
alone
but
for
the
morals
the
higher
life
of
the
white
man
as
well
the
negro
agrees
with
you
that
it
is
necessary
to
the
salvation
of
the
south
that
restrictions
be
put
upon
the
ballot
i
know
that
you
have
two
serious
problems
before
you
ignorant
and
corrupt
government
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
a
way
to
restrict
the
ballot
so
that
control
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
intelligent
without
regard
to
race
with
the
sincerest
sympathy
with
you
in
your
efforts
to
find
a
good
way
out
of
the
difficulty
i
want
to
suggest
that
no
state
in
the
south
can
make
a
law
that
will
provide
an
opportunity
or
temptation
for
an
ignorant
white
man
to
vote
and
withhold
the
opportunity
or
temptation
from
an
ignorant
coloured
man
without
injuring
both
men
no
state
can
make
a
law
that
can
thus
be
executed
without
dwarfing
for
all
time
the
morals
of
the
white
man
in
the
south
any
law
controlling
the
ballot
that
is
not
absolutely
just
and
fair
to
both
races
will
work
more
permanent
injury
to
the
whites
than
to
the
blacks
the
negro
does
not
object
to
an
educational
and
property
test
but
let
the
law
be
so
clear
that
no
one
clothed
with
state
authority
will
be
tempted
to
perjure
and
degrade
himself
by
putting
one
interpretation
upon
it
for
the
white
man
and
another
for
the
black
man
study
the
history
of
the
south
and
you
will
find
that
where
there
has
been
the
most
dishonesty
in
the
matter
of
voting
there
you
will
find
the
lowest
moral
condition
of
both
races
first
there
was
the
temptation
to
act
wrongly
with
the
negro
ballot
from
this
it
was
an
easy
step
to
act
dishonestly
with
the
white
man
ballot
to
the
carrying
of
concealed
weapons
to
the
murder
of
a
negro
and
then
to
the
murder
of
a
white
man
and
then
to
lynching
i
entreat
you
not
to
pass
a
law
that
will
prove
an
eternal
millstone
about
the
necks
of
your
children
no
man
can
have
respect
for
the
government
and
officers
of
the
law
when
he
knows
deep
down
in
his
heart
that
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
is
tainted
with
fraud
the
road
that
the
south
has
been
compelled
to
travel
during
the
last
thirty
years
has
been
strewn
with
thorns
and
thistles
it
has
been
as
one
groping
through
the
long
darkness
into
the
light
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
the
world
will
begin
to
appreciate
the
real
character
of
the
burden
that
was
imposed
upon
the
south
in
giving
the
franchise
to
four
millions
of
ignorant
and
impoverished
no
people
was
ever
before
given
such
a
problem
to
solve
history
has
blazed
no
path
through
the
wilderness
that
could
be
followed
for
thirty
years
we
have
wandered
in
the
wilderness
we
are
now
beginning
to
get
out
but
there
is
only
one
road
out
and
all
makeshifts
expedients
profit
and
loss
calculations
but
lead
into
swamps
quicksands
quagmires
and
jungles
there
is
a
highway
that
will
lead
both
races
out
into
the
pure
beautiful
sunshine
where
there
will
be
nothing
to
hide
and
nothing
to
explain
where
both
races
can
grow
strong
and
true
and
useful
in
every
fibre
of
their
being
i
believe
that
your
convention
will
find
this
highway
that
it
will
enact
a
fundamental
law
that
will
be
absolutely
just
and
fair
to
white
and
black
alike
i
beg
of
you
further
that
in
the
degree
that
you
close
the
against
the
ignorant
you
will
open
the
more
than
of
the
population
of
your
state
are
negroes
no
state
can
long
prosper
when
a
large
part
of
its
citizenship
is
in
ignorance
and
poverty
and
has
no
interest
in
the
government
i
beg
of
you
that
you
do
not
treat
us
as
an
alien
people
we
are
not
aliens
you
know
us
you
know
that
we
have
cleared
your
forests
tilled
your
fields
nursed
your
children
and
protected
your
families
there
is
an
attachment
between
us
that
few
understand
while
i
do
not
presume
to
be
able
to
advise
you
yet
it
is
in
my
heart
to
say
that
if
your
convention
would
do
something
that
would
prevent
for
all
time
strained
relations
between
the
two
races
and
would
permanently
settle
the
matter
of
political
relations
in
one
southern
state
at
least
let
the
very
best
educational
opportunities
be
provided
for
both
races
and
add
to
this
an
election
law
that
shall
be
incapable
of
unjust
discrimination
at
the
same
time
providing
that
in
proportion
as
the
ignorant
secure
education
property
and
character
they
will
be
given
the
right
of
citizenship
any
other
course
will
take
from
your
citizens
interest
in
the
state
and
hope
and
ambition
to
become
intelligent
producers
and
and
useful
and
virtuous
citizens
any
other
course
will
tie
the
white
citizens
of
louisiana
to
a
body
of
death
the
negroes
are
not
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
the
poverty
of
the
state
prevents
it
from
doing
all
that
it
desires
for
public
education
yet
i
believe
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
ignorance
is
more
costly
to
the
state
than
education
that
it
will
cost
louisiana
more
not
to
educate
the
negroes
than
it
will
to
educate
them
in
connection
with
a
generous
provision
for
public
schools
i
believe
that
nothing
will
so
help
my
own
people
in
your
state
as
provision
at
some
institution
for
the
highest
academic
and
normal
training
in
connection
with
thorough
training
in
agriculture
mechanics
and
domestic
economy
training
in
agriculture
horticulture
dairying
the
mechanical
arts
and
domestic
economy
would
make
us
intelligent
producers
and
not
only
help
us
to
contribute
our
honest
share
as
but
would
result
in
retaining
much
money
in
the
state
that
now
goes
outside
for
that
which
can
be
as
well
produced
at
home
an
institution
which
will
give
this
training
of
the
hand
along
with
the
highest
mental
culture
would
soon
convince
our
people
that
their
salvation
is
largely
in
the
ownership
of
property
and
in
industrial
and
business
development
rather
than
in
mere
political
agitation
the
highest
test
of
the
civilisation
of
any
race
is
in
its
willingness
to
extend
a
helping
hand
to
the
less
fortunate
a
race
like
an
individual
lifts
itself
up
by
lifting
others
up
surely
no
people
ever
had
a
greater
chance
to
exhibit
the
highest
christian
fortitude
and
magnanimity
than
is
now
presented
to
the
people
of
louisiana
it
requires
little
wisdom
or
statesmanship
to
repress
to
crush
out
to
retard
the
hopes
and
aspirations
of
a
people
but
the
highest
and
most
profound
statesmanship
is
shown
in
guiding
and
stimulating
a
people
so
that
every
fibre
in
the
body
and
soul
shall
be
made
to
contribute
in
the
highest
degree
to
the
usefulness
and
ability
of
the
state
it
is
along
this
line
that
i
pray
god
the
thoughts
and
activities
of
your
convention
may
be
guided
as
to
such
outbreaks
as
have
recently
occurred
in
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
the
remedy
will
not
be
reached
by
the
southern
white
man
merely
depriving
the
negro
of
his
rights
and
privileges
this
method
is
but
superficial
irritating
and
must
in
the
nature
of
things
be
the
statesman
to
cure
an
evil
resorts
to
enlightenment
to
stimulation
the
politician
to
repression
i
have
just
remarked
that
i
favour
the
giving
up
of
nothing
that
is
guaranteed
to
us
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
that
is
fundamental
to
our
citizenship
while
i
hold
to
these
views
as
strongly
as
any
one
i
differ
with
some
as
to
the
method
of
securing
the
permanent
and
peaceful
enjoyment
of
all
the
privileges
guaranteed
to
us
by
our
fundamental
law
in
finding
a
remedy
we
must
recognise
the
fact
that
the
negro
must
be
led
to
see
and
feel
that
he
must
make
every
effort
possible
in
every
way
possible
to
secure
the
friendship
the
confidence
the
of
his
white
neighbour
in
the
south
to
do
this
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
negro
to
become
a
truckler
or
a
trimmer
the
southern
white
man
has
no
respect
for
a
negro
who
does
not
act
from
principle
in
some
way
the
southern
white
man
must
be
led
to
see
that
it
is
to
his
interest
to
turn
his
attention
more
and
more
to
the
making
of
laws
that
will
in
the
truest
sense
elevate
the
negro
at
the
present
moment
in
many
cases
when
one
attempts
to
get
the
negro
to
with
the
southern
white
man
he
asks
the
question
can
the
people
who
force
me
to
ride
in
a
jim
crow
car
and
pay
fare
be
my
best
friends
in
answering
such
questions
the
southern
white
man
as
well
as
the
negro
has
a
duty
to
perform
in
the
exercise
of
his
political
rights
i
should
advise
the
negro
to
be
temperate
and
modest
and
more
and
more
to
do
his
own
thinking
i
believe
the
permanent
cure
for
our
present
evils
will
come
through
a
property
and
educational
test
for
voting
that
shall
apply
honestly
and
fairly
to
both
races
this
will
cut
off
the
large
mass
of
ignorant
voters
of
both
races
that
is
now
proving
so
demoralising
a
factor
in
the
politics
of
the
southern
states
but
most
of
all
it
will
come
through
industrial
development
of
the
negro
industrial
education
makes
an
intelligent
producer
of
the
negro
who
becomes
of
immediate
value
to
the
community
rather
than
one
who
yields
to
the
temptation
to
live
merely
by
politics
or
other
parasitical
employments
it
will
make
him
soon
become
a
and
when
a
citizen
becomes
a
holder
of
property
he
becomes
a
conservative
and
thoughtful
voter
he
will
more
carefully
consider
the
measures
and
individuals
to
be
voted
for
in
proportion
as
he
increases
his
property
interests
he
becomes
important
as
a
there
is
little
trouble
between
the
negro
and
the
white
man
in
matters
of
education
and
when
it
comes
to
his
business
development
the
black
man
has
implicit
faith
in
the
advice
of
the
southern
white
man
when
he
gets
into
trouble
in
the
courts
which
requires
a
bond
to
be
given
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
goes
to
a
southern
white
man
for
advice
and
assistance
every
one
who
has
lived
in
the
south
knows
that
in
many
of
the
church
troubles
among
the
coloured
people
the
ministers
and
other
church
officers
apply
to
the
nearest
white
minister
for
assistance
and
instruction
when
by
reason
of
mutual
concession
we
reach
the
point
where
we
shall
consult
the
southern
white
man
about
our
politics
as
we
now
consult
him
about
our
business
legal
and
religious
matters
there
will
be
a
change
for
the
better
in
the
situation
the
of
a
thousand
negroes
in
every
county
in
the
south
who
own
neat
and
comfortable
homes
possessing
skill
industry
and
thrift
with
money
in
the
bank
and
are
large
with
the
white
men
in
the
south
in
every
manly
way
for
the
development
of
their
own
communities
and
counties
will
go
a
long
way
in
a
few
years
toward
changing
the
present
status
of
the
negro
as
a
citizen
as
well
as
the
attitude
of
the
whites
toward
the
blacks
as
the
negro
grows
in
industrial
and
business
directions
he
will
divide
in
his
politics
on
economic
issues
just
as
the
white
man
in
other
parts
of
the
country
now
divides
his
vote
as
the
south
grows
in
business
prosperity
it
will
divide
its
vote
on
economic
issues
just
as
other
sections
of
the
country
divide
their
vote
when
we
can
enact
laws
that
result
in
honestly
cutting
off
the
large
ignorant
and
vote
and
when
we
can
bring
both
races
to
the
point
where
they
will
with
each
other
in
politics
as
they
do
now
in
matters
of
business
religion
and
education
the
problem
will
be
in
a
large
measure
solved
and
political
outbreaks
will
cease
chapter
vii
one
of
the
great
questions
which
christian
education
must
face
in
the
south
is
the
proper
adjustment
of
the
new
relations
of
the
two
races
it
is
a
question
which
must
be
faced
calmly
quietly
dispassionately
and
the
time
has
now
come
to
rise
above
party
above
race
above
colour
above
sectionalism
into
the
region
of
duty
of
man
to
man
of
american
to
american
of
christian
to
christian
i
remember
not
long
ago
when
about
five
hundred
coloured
people
sailed
from
the
port
of
savannah
bound
for
liberia
that
the
news
was
flashed
all
over
the
country
the
negro
has
made
up
his
mind
to
return
to
his
own
country
and
that
in
this
was
the
solution
of
the
race
problem
in
the
south
but
these
people
forgot
the
fact
that
before
breakfast
that
morning
about
five
hundred
more
negro
children
were
born
in
the
south
alone
and
then
once
in
a
while
somebody
is
so
bold
as
to
predict
that
the
negro
will
be
absorbed
by
the
white
race
let
us
look
at
this
phase
of
the
question
for
a
moment
it
is
a
fact
that
if
a
person
is
known
to
have
one
per
cent
of
african
blood
in
his
veins
he
ceases
to
be
a
white
man
the
per
cent
of
caucasian
blood
does
not
weigh
by
the
side
of
the
one
per
cent
of
african
blood
the
white
blood
counts
for
nothing
the
person
is
a
negro
every
time
so
it
will
be
a
very
difficult
task
for
the
white
man
to
absorb
the
negro
somebody
else
conceived
the
idea
of
colonising
the
coloured
people
of
getting
territory
where
nobody
lived
putting
the
coloured
people
there
and
letting
them
be
a
nation
all
by
themselves
there
are
two
objections
to
that
first
you
would
have
to
build
one
wall
to
keep
the
coloured
people
in
and
another
wall
to
keep
the
white
people
out
if
you
were
to
build
ten
walls
around
africa
you
could
not
keep
the
white
people
out
especially
as
long
as
there
was
a
hope
of
finding
gold
there
i
have
always
had
the
highest
respect
for
those
of
our
race
who
in
trying
to
find
a
solution
for
our
southern
problem
advised
a
return
of
the
race
to
africa
and
because
of
my
respect
for
those
who
have
thus
advised
especially
bishop
henry
turner
i
have
tried
to
make
a
careful
and
unbiassed
study
of
the
question
during
a
recent
sojourn
in
europe
to
see
what
opportunities
presented
themselves
in
africa
for
and
i
am
free
to
say
that
i
see
no
way
out
of
the
negro
present
condition
in
the
south
by
returning
to
africa
aside
from
other
insurmountable
obstacles
there
is
no
place
in
africa
for
him
to
go
where
his
condition
would
be
improved
all
europe
especially
england
france
and
germany
has
been
running
a
mad
race
for
the
last
twenty
years
to
see
which
could
gobble
up
the
greater
part
of
africa
and
there
is
practically
nothing
left
old
king
cetewayo
put
it
pretty
well
when
he
said
first
come
missionary
then
come
rum
then
come
traders
then
come
army
and
cecil
rhodes
has
expressed
the
prevailing
sentiment
more
recently
in
these
words
i
would
rather
have
land
than
and
cecil
rhodes
is
directly
responsible
for
the
killing
of
thousands
of
black
natives
in
south
africa
that
he
might
secure
their
land
in
a
talk
with
henry
stanley
the
explorer
he
told
me
that
he
knew
no
place
in
africa
where
the
negroes
of
the
united
states
might
go
to
advantage
but
i
want
to
be
more
specific
let
us
see
how
africa
has
been
divided
and
then
decide
whether
there
is

it
will
be
noted
that
when
one
of
these
european
countries
can
not
get
direct
control
over
any
section
of
africa
it
at
once
gives
it
out
to
the
world
that
the
country
wanted
is
in
the
sphere
of
its
influence
a
very
convenient
term
if
we
are
to
go
to
africa
and
be
under
the
control
of
another
government
i
think
we
should
prefer
to
take
our
chances
in
the
sphere
of
influence
of
the
united
states
all
this
shows
pretty
conclusively
that
a
return
to
africa
for
the
negro
is
out
of
the
question
even
provided
that
a
majority
of
the
negroes
wished
to
go
back
which
they
do
not
the
adjustment
of
the
relations
of
the
two
races
must
take
place
here
and
it
is
taking
place
slowly
but
surely
as
the
negro
is
educated
to
make
homes
and
to
respect
himself
the
white
man
will
in
turn
respect
him
it
has
been
urged
that
the
negro
has
inherent
in
him
certain
traits
of
character
that
will
prevent
his
ever
reaching
the
standard
of
civilisation
set
by
the
whites
and
taking
his
place
among
them
as
an
equal
it
may
be
some
time
before
the
negro
race
as
a
whole
can
stand
comparison
with
the
white
in
all
respects
it
would
be
most
remarkable
considering
the
past
if
it
were
not
so
but
the
idea
that
his
objectionable
traits
and
weaknesses
are
fundamental
i
think
is
a
mistake
for
although
there
are
elements
of
weakness
about
the
negro
race
there
are
also
many
evidences
of
strength
it
is
an
encouraging
sign
however
when
an
individual
grows
to
the
point
where
he
can
hold
himself
up
for
personal
analysis
and
study
it
is
equally
encouraging
for
a
race
to
be
able
to
study
itself
to
measure
its
weakness
and
strength
it
is
not
helpful
to
a
race
to
be
continually
praised
and
have
its
weakness
overlooked
neither
is
it
the
most
helpful
thing
to
have
its
faults
alone
continually
dwelt
upon
what
is
needed
is
downright
straightforward
honesty
in
both
directions
and
this
is
not
always
to
be
obtained
there
is
little
question
that
one
of
the
negroes
weak
points
is
physical
especially
is
this
true
regarding
those
who
live
in
the
large
cities
north
and
south
but
in
almost
every
case
this
physical
weakness
can
be
traced
to
ignorant
violation
of
the
laws
of
health
or
to
vicious
habits
the
negro
who
during
slavery
lived
on
the
large
plantations
in
the
south
surrounded
by
restraints
at
the
close
of
the
war
came
to
the
cities
and
in
many
cases
found
the
freedom
and
temptations
of
the
city
too
much
for
him
the
transition
was
too
sudden
when
we
consider
what
it
meant
to
have
four
millions
of
people
slaves
and
freemen
the
wonder
is
that
the
race
has
not
suffered
more
physically
than
it
has
i
do
not
believe
that
statistics
can
be
so
marshalled
as
to
prove
that
the
negro
as
a
race
is
physically
or
numerically
on
the
decline
on
the
other
hand
the
negro
as
a
race
is
increasing
in
numbers
by
a
larger
percentage
than
is
true
of
the
french
nation
while
the
is
large
in
the
cities
the
is
also
large
and
it
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
per
cent
of
these
people
in
the
gulf
states
are
in
the
country
districts
and
smaller
towns
and
there
the
increase
is
along
healthy
and
normal
lines
as
the
negro
becomes
educated
the
high
in
the
cities
will
disappear
for
proof
of
this
i
have
only
to
mention
that
a
few
years
ago
no
coloured
man
could
get
insurance
in
the
large
insurance
companies
now
there
are
few
of
these
companies
which
do
not
seek
the
insurance
of
educated
coloured
men
in
the
north
and
south
the
physical
intoxication
that
was
the
result
of
sudden
freedom
is
giving
way
to
an
encouraging
sobering
process
and
as
this
continues
the
high
will
disappear
even
in
the
large
cities
another
element
of
weakness
which
shows
itself
in
the
present
stage
of
the
civilisation
of
the
negro
is
his
lack
of
ability
to
form
a
purpose
and
stick
to
it
through
a
series
of
years
if
need
be
years
that
involve
discouragement
as
well
as
encouragement
till
the
end
shall
be
reached
of
course
there
are
brilliant
exceptions
to
this
rule
but
there
is
no
question
that
here
is
an
element
of
weakness
and
the
same
i
think
would
be
true
of
any
race
with
the
negro
history
few
of
the
resolutions
which
are
made
in
conventions
are
remembered
and
put
into
practice
six
months
after
the
warmth
and
enthusiasm
of
the
debating
hall
have
disappeared
this
i
know
is
an
element
of
the
white
man
weakness
but
it
is
the
negro
i
am
discussing
not
the
white
man
individually
the
negro
is
strong
collectively
he
is
weak
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
the
ability
to
succeed
in
organised
bodies
is
one
of
the
highest
points
in
civilisation
there
are
scores
of
coloured
men
who
can
succeed
in
any
line
of
business
as
individuals
or
will
discuss
any
subject
in
a
most
intelligent
manner
yet
who
when
they
attempt
to
act
in
an
organised
body
are
utter
failures
but
the
weakness
of
the
negro
which
is
most
frequently
held
up
to
the
public
gaze
is
that
of
his
moral
character
no
one
who
wants
to
be
honest
and
at
the
same
time
benefit
the
race
will
deny
that
here
is
where
the
strengthening
is
to
be
done
it
has
become
universally
accepted
that
the
family
is
the
foundation
the
bulwark
of
any
race
it
should
be
remembered
sorrowfully
withal
that
it
was
the
constant
tendency
of
slavery
to
destroy
the
family
life
all
through
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
slavery
one
of
the
chief
objects
was
to
increase
the
number
of
slaves
and
to
this
end
almost
all
thought
of
morality
was
lost
sight
of
so
that
the
negro
has
had
only
about
thirty
years
in
which
to
develop
a
family
life
while
the
rate
with
which
he
is
constantly
being
compared
has
had
thousands
of
years
of
training
in
home
life
the
negro
felt
all
through
the
years
of
bondage
that
he
was
being
forcibly
and
unjustly
deprived
of
the
fruits
of
his
labour
hence
he
felt
that
anything
he
could
get
from
the
white
man
in
return
for
this
labour
justly
belonged
to
him
since
this
was
true
we
must
be
patient
in
trying
to
teach
him
a
different
code
of
morals
from
the
nature
of
things
all
through
slavery
it
was
life
in
the
future
world
that
was
emphasised
in
religious
teaching
rather
than
life
in
this
world
in
his
religious
meetings
in
days
the
negro
was
prevented
from
discussing
many
points
of
practical
religion
which
related
to
this
world
and
the
white
minister
who
was
his
spiritual
guide
found
it
more
convenient
to
talk
about
heaven
than
earth
so
very
naturally
that
in
his
religious
meeting
it
is
the
negro
feelings
which
are
worked
upon
mostly
and
it
is
description
of
the
glories
of
heaven
that
occupy
most
of
the
time
of
his
sermon
having
touched
upon
some
of
the
weak
points
of
the
negro
what
are
his
strong
characteristics
the
negro
in
america
is
different
from
most
people
for
whom
missionary
effort
is
made
in
that
he
works
he
is
not
ashamed
or
afraid
of
work
when
hard
constant
work
is
required
ask
any
southern
white
man
and
he
will
tell
you
that
in
this
the
negro
has
no
superior
he
is
not
given
to
strikes
or
to
lockouts
he
not
only
works
himself
but
he
is
unwilling
to
prevent
other
people
from
working
of
the
forty
buildings
of
various
kinds
and
sizes
on
the
grounds
of
the
tuskegee
normal
and
industrial
institute
in
alabama
as
i
have
stated
before
almost
all
of
them
are
the
results
of
the
labour
performed
by
the
students
while
securing
their
academic
education
one
day
the
student
is
in
his
history
class
the
next
day
the
same
student
equally
happy
with
his
trowel
and
in
overalls
is
working
on
a
brick
wall
while
at
present
the
negro
may
lack
that
tenacious
mental
grasp
which
enables
one
to
pursue
a
scientific
or
mathematical
investigation
through
a
series
of
years
he
has
that
delicate
mental
feeling
which
enables
him
to
succeed
in
oratory
music
etc
while
i
have
spoken
of
the
negro
moral
weakness
i
hope
it
will
be
kept
in
mind
that
in
his
original
state
his
is
an
honest
race
it
was
slavery
that
corrupted
him
in
this
respect
but
in
morals
he
also
has
his
strong
points
few
have
ever
found
the
negro
guilty
of
betraying
a
trust
there
are
almost
no
instances
in
which
the
negro
betrayed
either
a
federal
or
a
confederate
soldier
who
confided
in
him
there
are
few
instances
where
the
negro
has
been
entrusted
with
valuables
when
he
has
not
been
faithful
this
country
has
never
had
a
more
loyal
citizen
he
has
never
proven
himself
a
rebel
should
the
southern
states
which
so
long
held
him
in
slavery
be
invaded
by
a
foreign
foe
the
negro
would
be
among
the
first
to
come
to
the
rescue
perhaps
the
most
encouraging
thing
in
connection
with
the
lifting
up
of
the
negro
in
this
country
is
the
fact
that
he
knows
that
he
is
down
and
wants
to
get
up
he
knows
that
he
is
ignorant
and
wants
to
get
light
he
fills
every
and
every
church
which
is
opened
for
him
he
is
willing
to
follow
leaders
when
he
is
once
convinced
that
the
leaders
have
his
best
interest
at
heart
under
the
constant
influence
of
the
christian
education
which
began
years
ago
his
religion
is
every
year
becoming
less
emotional
and
more
rational
and
practical
though
i
for
one
hope
that
he
will
always
retain
in
a
large
degree
the
emotional
element
in
religion
during
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
that
the
negro
spent
in
slavery
he
had
little
cause
or
incentive
to
accumulate
money
or
property
years
ago
this
was
something
which
he
had
to
begin
to
learn
while
the
great
bulk
of
the
race
is
still
without
money
and
property
yet
the
signs
of
thrift
are
evident
on
every
hand
especially
is
this
noticeable
in
the
large
number
of
neat
little
homes
which
are
owned
by
these
people
on
the
outer
edges
of
the
towns
and
cities
in
the
south
i
wish
to
give
an
example
of
the
sort
of
thing
the
negro
has
to
contend
with
however
in
his
efforts
to
lift
himself
up
not
long
ago
a
mother
a
black
mother
who
lived
in
one
of
our
northern
states
had
heard
it
whispered
around
in
her
community
for
years
that
the
negro
was
lazy
shiftless
and
would
not
work
so
when
her
only
boy
grew
to
sufficient
size
at
considerable
expense
and
great
she
had
her
boy
thoroughly
taught
the
machinist
trade
a
job
was
secured
in
a
neighbouring
shop
with
dinner
bucket
in
hand
and
spurred
on
by
the
prayers
of
the
now
mother
the
boy
entered
the
shop
to
begin
his
first
day
work
what
happened
every
one
of
the
twenty
white
men
threw
down
his
tools
and
deliberately
walked
out
swearing
that
he
would
not
give
a
black
man
an
opportunity
to
earn
an
honest
living
another
shop
was
tried
with
the
same
result
and
still
another
the
result
ever
the
same
this
once
promising
ambitious
black
man
is
a
wreck
a
confirmed
drunkard
with
no
hope
no
ambition
i
ask
who
blasted
the
life
of
this
young
man
on
whose
hands
does
his
lifeblood
rest
the
present
system
of
education
or
rather
want
of
education
is
responsible
public
schools
and
colleges
should
turn
out
men
who
will
throw
open
the
doors
of
industry
so
that
all
men
everywhere
regardless
of
colour
shall
have
the
same
opportunity
to
earn
a
dollar
that
they
now
have
to
spend
it
i
know
of
a
good
many
kinds
of
cowardice
and
prejudice
but
i
know
none
equal
to
this
i
know
not
which
is
the
worst
the
slaveholder
who
perforce
compelled
his
slave
to
work
without
compensation
or
the
man
who
by
force
and
strikes
compels
his
neighbour
to
refrain
from
working
for
compensation
the
negro
will
be
on
a
different
footing
in
this
country
when
it
becomes
common
to
associate
the
possession
of
wealth
with
a
black
skin
it
is
not
within
the
province
of
human
nature
that
the
man
who
is
intelligent
and
virtuous
and
owns
and
cultivates
the
best
farm
in
his
county
is
the
largest
shall
very
long
be
denied
proper
respect
and
consideration
those
who
would
help
the
negro
most
effectually
during
the
next
fifty
years
can
do
so
by
assisting
in
his
development
along
scientific
and
industrial
lines
in
connection
with
the
broadest
mental
and
religious
culture
from
the
results
of
the
war
with
spain
let
us
learn
this
that
god
has
been
teaching
the
spanish
nation
a
terrible
lesson
what
is
it
simply
this
that
no
nation
can
disregard
the
interest
of
any
portion
of
its
members
without
that
nation
becoming
weak
and
corrupt
the
penalty
may
be
long
delayed
god
has
been
teaching
spain
that
for
every
one
of
her
subjects
that
she
has
left
in
ignorance
poverty
and
crime
the
price
must
be
paid
and
if
it
has
not
been
paid
with
the
very
heart
of
the
nation
it
must
be
paid
with
the
proudest
and
bluest
blood
of
her
sons
and
with
treasure
that
is
beyond
computation
from
this
spectacle
i
pray
god
that
america
will
learn
a
lesson
in
respect
to
the
ten
million
negroes
in
this
country
the
negroes
in
the
united
states
are
in
most
of
the
elements
of
civilisation
weak
providence
has
placed
them
here
not
without
a
purpose
one
object
in
my
opinion
is
that
the
stronger
race
may
imbibe
a
lesson
from
the
weaker
in
patience
forbearance
and
childlike
yet
supreme
trust
in
the
god
of
the
universe
this
race
has
been
placed
here
that
the
white
man
might
have
a
great
opportunity
of
lifting
himself
by
lifting
it
up
out
from
the
negro
colleges
and
industrial
schools
in
the
south
there
are
going
forth
each
year
thousands
of
young
men
and
women
into
dark
and
secluded
corners
into
lonely
log
amidst
poverty
and
ignorance
and
though
when
they
go
forth
no
drums
beat
no
banners
fly
no
friends
cheer
yet
they
are
fighting
the
battles
of
this
country
just
as
truly
and
bravely
as
those
who
go
forth
to
do
battle
against
a
foreign
enemy
if
they
are
encouraged
and
properly
supported
in
their
work
of
educating
the
masses
in
the
industries
in
economy
and
in
morals
as
well
as
mentally
they
will
before
many
years
get
the
race
upon
such
an
intellectual
industrial
and
financial
footing
that
it
will
be
able
to
enjoy
without
much
trouble
all
the
rights
inherent
in
american
citizenship
now
if
we
wish
to
bring
the
race
to
a
point
where
it
should
be
where
it
will
be
strong
and
grow
and
prosper
we
have
got
to
in
every
way
possible
encourage
it
we
can
do
this
in
no
better
way
than
by
cultivating
that
amount
of
faith
in
the
race
which
will
make
us
patronise
its
own
enterprises
wherever
those
enterprises
are
worth
patronising
i
do
not
believe
much
in
the
advice
that
is
often
given
that
we
should
patronise
the
enterprises
of
our
race
without
regard
to
the
worth
of
those
enterprises
i
believe
that
the
best
way
to
bring
the
race
to
the
point
where
it
will
compare
with
other
races
is
to
let
it
understand
that
whenever
it
enters
into
any
line
of
business
it
will
be
patronised
just
in
proportion
as
it
makes
that
business
as
successful
as
useful
as
is
true
of
any
business
enterprise
conducted
by
any
other
race
the
race
that
would
grow
strong
and
powerful
must
have
the
element
of
in
it
that
will
in
the
largest
degree
make
it
honour
its
great
men
the
men
who
have
succeeded
in
that
race
i
think
we
should
be
ashamed
of
the
coloured
man
or
woman
who
would
not
venerate
the
name
of
frederick
douglass
no
race
that
would
not
look
upon
such
a
man
with
honour
and
respect
and
pride
could
ever
hope
to
enjoy
the
respect
of
any
other
race
i
speak
of
this
not
that
i
want
my
people
to
regard
themselves
in
a
narrow
bigoted
sense
because
there
is
nothing
so
hurtful
to
an
individual
or
to
a
race
as
to
get
into
the
habit
of
feeling
that
there
is
no
good
except
in
its
own
race
but
because
i
wish
that
it
may
have
reasonable
pride
in
all
that
is
honourable
in
its
history
whenever
you
hear
a
coloured
man
say
that
he
hates
the
people
of
the
other
race
there
in
most
instances
you
will
find
a
weak
coloured
man
and
whenever
you
find
a
white
man
who
expresses
the
same
sentiment
toward
the
people
of
other
races
there
too
in
almost
every
case
you
will
find
a
prejudiced
white
man
that
person
is
the
broadest
strongest
and
most
useful
who
sees
something
to
love
and
admire
in
all
races
no
matter
what
their
colour
if
the
negro
race
wishes
to
grow
strong
it
must
learn
to
respect
itself
not
to
be
ashamed
it
must
learn
that
it
will
only
grow
in
proportion
as
its
members
have
confidence
in
it
in
proportion
as
they
believe
that
it
is
a
coming
race
we
have
reached
a
period
when
educated
negroes
should
give
more
attention
to
the
history
of
their
race
should
devote
more
time
to
finding
out
the
true
history
of
the
race
and
in
collecting
in
some
museum
the
relics
that
mark
its
progress
it
is
true
of
all
races
of
culture
and
refinement
and
civilisation
that
they
have
gathered
in
some
place
the
relics
which
mark
the
progress
of
their
civilisation
which
show
how
they
lived
from
period
to
period
we
should
have
so
much
pride
that
we
would
spend
more
time
in
looking
into
the
history
of
the
race
more
effort
and
money
in
perpetuating
in
some
durable
form
its
achievements
so
that
from
year
to
year
instead
of
looking
back
with
regret
we
can
point
to
our
children
the
rough
path
through
which
we
grew
strong
and
great
we
have
a
very
bright
and
striking
example
in
the
history
of
the
jews
in
this
and
other
countries
there
is
perhaps
no
race
that
has
suffered
so
much
not
so
much
in
america
as
in
some
of
the
countries
in
europe
but
these
people
have
clung
together
they
have
had
a
certain
amount
of
unity
pride
and
love
of
race
and
as
the
years
go
on
they
will
be
more
and
more
influential
in
this
country
a
country
where
they
were
once
despised
and
looked
upon
with
scorn
and
derision
it
is
largely
because
the
jewish
race
has
had
faith
in
itself
unless
the
negro
learns
more
and
more
to
imitate
the
jew
in
these
matters
to
have
faith
in
himself
he
can
not
expect
to
have
any
high
degree
of
success
i
wish
to
speak
upon
another
subject
which
largely
concerns
the
welfare
of
both
races
especially
in
the
south
lynching
it
is
an
unpleasant
subject
but
i
feel
that
i
should
be
omitting
some
part
of
my
duty
to
both
races
did
i
not
say
something
on
the
subject
for
a
number
of
years
the
south
has
appealed
to
the
north
and
to
federal
authorities
through
the
public
press
from
the
public
platform
and
most
eloquently
through
the
late
henry
grady
to
leave
the
whole
matter
of
the
rights
and
protection
of
the
negro
to
the
south
declaring
that
it
would
see
to
it
that
the
negro
would
be
made
secure
in
his
citizenship
during
the
last
years
the
whole
country
from
the
president
down
has
been
inclined
more
than
ever
to
pursue
this
policy
leaving
the
whole
matter
of
the
destiny
of
the
negro
to
the
negro
himself
and
to
the
southern
white
people
among
whom
the
great
bulk
of
negroes
live
by
the
present
policy
of
on
the
part
of
the
north
and
the
federal
government
the
south
is
given
a
sacred
trust
how
will
she
execute
this
trust
the
world
is
waiting
and
watching
to
see
the
question
must
be
answered
largely
by
the
protection
it
gives
to
the
life
of
the
negro
and
the
provisions
that
are
made
for
his
development
in
the
organic
laws
of
the
state
i
fear
that
but
few
people
in
the
south
realise
to
what
an
extent
the
habit
of
lynching
or
the
taking
of
life
without
due
process
of
law
has
taken
hold
of
us
and
is
hurting
us
not
only
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
in
our
own
moral
and
material
growth
lynching
was
instituted
some
years
ago
with
the
idea
of
punishing
and
checking
criminal
assaults
upon
women
let
us
examine
the
facts
and
see
where
it
has
already
led
us
and
is
likely
further
to
carry
us
if
we
do
not
rid
ourselves
of
the
evil
many
good
people
in
the
south
and
also
out
of
the
south
have
gotten
the
idea
that
lynching
is
resorted
to
for
one
crime
only
i
have
the
facts
from
an
authoritative
source
during
last
year
one
hundred
and
persons
were
lynched
in
the
united
states
of
this
number
one
hundred
and
eighteen
were
executed
in
the
south
and
nine
in
the
north
and
west
of
the
total
number
lynched
one
hundred
and
two
were
negroes
were
whites
and
two
indians
now
let
every
one
interested
in
the
south
his
country
and
the
cause
of
humanity
note
this
fact
that
only
of
the
entire
number
were
charged
in
any
way
with
the
crime
of
rape
that
is
out
of
one
hundred
and
cases
of
lynching
of
the
remaining
cases
were
for
murder
thirteen
for
being
suspected
of
murder
six
for
theft
etc
during
one
week
last
spring
when
i
kept
a
careful
record
thirteen
negroes
were
lynched
in
three
of
our
southern
states
and
not
one
was
even
charged
with
rape
all
of
these
thirteen
were
accused
of
murder
or
but
in
neither
case
were
the
men
allowed
to
go
before
a
court
so
that
their
innocence
or
guilt
might
be
proven
when
we
get
to
the
point
where
of
the
people
lynched
in
our
country
in
one
year
are
for
some
crime
other
than
rape
we
can
no
longer
plead
and
explain
that
we
lynch
for
one
crime
alone
let
us
take
another
year
that
of
for
example
when
persons
were
lynched
in
the
whole
united
states
of
this
number
were
lynched
in
northern
and
western
states
and
in
our
southern
states
were
negroes
of
these
being
women
the
facts
show
that
out
of
the
lynched
only
were
even
charged
with
rape
or
attempted
rape
leaving
in
this
year
alone
persons
who
were
lynched
for
other
causes
than
that
of
rape
if
it
were
necessary
i
could
produce
figures
for
other
years
within
a
period
of
six
years
about
persons
have
been
lynched
in
our
southern
states
this
is
but
a
few
hundred
short
of
the
total
number
of
soldiers
who
lost
their
lives
in
cuba
during
the
war
if
we
would
realise
still
more
fully
how
far
this
unfortunate
evil
is
leading
us
on
note
the
classes
of
crime
during
a
few
months
for
which
the
local
papers
and
the
associated
press
say
that
lynching
has
been
inflicted
they
include
murder
rioting
incendiarism
robbery
larceny
insulting
women
alleged
malpractice
alleged
suspected
robbery
race
prejudice
attempted
murder
mistaken
identity
etc
the
evil
has
so
grown
that
we
are
now
at
the
point
where
not
only
blacks
are
lynched
in
the
south
but
white
men
as
well
not
only
this
but
within
the
last
six
years
at
least
a
coloured
women
have
been
lynched
and
there
are
a
few
cases
where
negroes
have
lynched
members
of
their
own
race
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
all
this
furthermore
every
lynching
drives
hundreds
of
negroes
out
of
the
farming
districts
of
the
south
where
they
make
the
best
living
and
where
their
services
are
of
greatest
value
to
the
country
into
the
already
cities
i
know
that
some
argue
that
the
crime
of
lynching
negroes
is
not
confined
to
the
south
this
is
true
and
no
one
can
excuse
such
a
crime
as
the
shooting
of
innocent
black
men
in
illinois
who
were
guilty
of
nothing
except
seeking
labour
but
my
words
just
now
are
to
the
south
where
my
home
is
and
a
part
of
which
i
am
let
other
sections
act
as
they
will
i
want
to
see
our
beautiful
southland
free
from
this
terrible
evil
of
lynching
lynching
does
not
stop
crime
in
the
vicinity
in
the
south
where
a
coloured
man
was
alleged
recently
to
have
committed
the
most
terrible
crime
ever
charged
against
a
member
of
my
race
but
a
few
weeks
previously
five
coloured
men
had
been
lynched
for
supposed
incendiarism
if
lynching
was
a
cure
for
crime
surely
the
lynching
of
those
five
would
have
prevented
another
negro
from
committing
a
most
heinous
crime
a
few
weeks
later
we
might
as
well
face
the
facts
bravely
and
wisely
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
crime
has
been
committed
in
all
civilised
and
uncivilised
countries
and
a
certain
percentage
of
it
will
always
be
committed
both
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
but
i
believe
that
the
crime
of
rape
can
be
stopped
in
proportion
to
the
numbers
and
intelligence
of
the
population
of
the
south
there
exists
little
more
crime
than
in
several
other
sections
of
the
country
but
because
of
the
lynching
evil
we
are
constantly
advertising
ourselves
to
the
world
as
a
lawless
people
we
can
not
disregard
the
teachings
of
the
civilised
world
for
eighteen
hundred
years
that
the
only
way
to
punish
crime
is
by
law
when
we
leave
this
anchorage
chaos
begins
i
am
not
pleading
for
the
negro
alone
lynching
injures
hardens
and
blunts
the
moral
sensibilities
of
the
young
and
tender
manhood
of
the
south
never
shall
i
forget
the
remark
by
a
little
white
boy
with
blue
eyes
and
flaxen
hair
the
little
fellow
said
to
his
mother
after
he
had
returned
from
a
lynching
i
have
seen
a
man
hanged
now
i
wish
i
could
see
one
burned
rather
than
hear
such
a
remark
from
one
of
my
little
boys
i
would
prefer
to
see
him
in
his
grave
this
is
not
all
every
community
guilty
of
lynching
says
in
so
many
words
to
the
governor
to
the
legislature
to
the
sheriff
to
the
jury
and
to
the
judge
we
have
no
faith
in
you
and
no
respect
for
you
we
have
no
respect
for
the
law
which
we
helped
to
make
in
the
south
at
the
present
time
there
is
less
excuse
for
not
permitting
the
law
to
take
its
course
where
a
negro
is
to
be
tried
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
for
almost
without
exception
the
governors
the
sheriffs
the
judges
the
juries
and
the
lawyers
are
all
white
men
and
they
can
be
trusted
as
a
rule
to
do
their
duty
otherwise
it
is
needless
to
tax
the
people
to
support
these
officers
if
our
present
laws
are
not
sufficient
properly
to
punish
crime
let
the
laws
be
changed
but
that
the
punishment
may
be
by
lawfully
constituted
authorities
is
the
plea
i
make
the
history
of
the
world
proves
that
where
the
law
is
most
strictly
enforced
there
is
the
least
crime
where
people
take
the
administration
of
the
law
into
their
own
hands
there
is
the
most
crime
but
there
is
still
another
side
the
white
man
in
the
south
has
not
only
a
serious
duty
and
responsibility
but
the
negro
has
a
duty
and
responsibility
in
this
matter
in
speaking
of
my
own
people
i
want
to
be
equally
frank
but
i
speak
with
the
greatest
kindness
there
is
too
much
crime
among
them
the
figures
for
a
given
period
show
that
in
the
united
states
thirty
per
cent
of
the
crime
committed
is
by
negroes
while
we
constitute
only
about
twelve
per
cent
of
the
entire
population
this
proportion
holds
good
not
only
in
the
south
but
also
in
northern
states
and
cities
no
race
that
is
so
largely
ignorant
and
so
recently
out
of
slavery
could
perhaps
show
a
better
record
but
we
must
face
these
plain
facts
he
is
most
kind
to
the
negro
who
tells
him
of
his
faults
as
well
as
of
his
virtues
a
large
percentage
of
the
crime
among
us
grows
out
of
the
idleness
of
our
young
men
and
women
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
have
tried
to
insist
upon
some
industry
being
taught
in
connection
with
their
course
of
literary
training
it
is
vitally
important
now
that
every
parent
every
teacher
and
minister
of
the
gospel
should
teach
with
unusual
emphasis
morality
and
obedience
to
the
law
at
the
fireside
in
the
in
the
from
the
pulpit
and
in
the
negro
press
there
should
be
such
a
sentiment
created
regarding
the
committing
of
crime
against
women
that
no
such
crime
could
be
charged
against
any
member
of
the
race
let
it
be
understood
for
all
time
that
no
one
guilty
of
rape
can
find
sympathy
or
shelter
with
us
and
that
none
will
be
more
active
than
we
in
bringing
to
justice
through
the
proper
authorities
those
guilty
of
crime
let
the
criminal
and
vicious
element
of
the
race
have
at
all
times
our
most
severe
condemnation
let
a
strict
line
be
drawn
between
the
virtuous
and
the
criminal
i
condemn
with
all
the
indignation
of
my
soul
any
beast
in
human
form
guilty
of
assaulting
a
woman
i
am
sure
i
voice
the
sentiment
of
the
thoughtful
of
my
race
in
this
condemnation
we
should
not
as
a
race
become
discouraged
we
are
making
progress
no
race
has
ever
gotten
upon
its
feet
without
discouragements
and
struggles
i
should
be
a
great
hypocrite
and
a
coward
if
i
did
not
add
that
which
my
daily
experience
has
taught
me
to
be
true
namely
that
the
negro
has
among
many
of
the
southern
whites
as
good
friends
as
he
has
anywhere
in
the
world
these
friends
have
not
forsaken
us
they
will
not
do
so
neither
will
our
friends
in
the
north
if
we
make
ourselves
intelligent
industrious
economical
and
virtuous
of
value
to
the
community
in
which
we
live
we
can
and
will
work
out
our
salvation
right
here
in
the
south
in
every
community
by
means
of
organised
effort
we
should
seek
in
a
manly
and
honourable
way
the
confidence
the
the
sympathy
of
the
best
white
people
in
the
south
and
in
our
respective
communities
with
the
best
white
people
and
the
best
black
people
standing
together
in
favour
of
law
and
order
and
justice
i
believe
that
the
safety
and
happiness
of
both
races
will
be
made
secure
we
are
one
in
this
country
the
question
of
the
highest
citizenship
and
the
complete
education
of
all
concerns
nearly
ten
millions
of
my
people
and
sixty
millions
of
the
white
race
when
one
race
is
strong
the
other
is
strong
when
one
is
weak
the
other
is
weak
there
is
no
power
that
can
separate
our
destiny
unjust
laws
and
customs
which
exist
in
many
places
injure
the
white
man
and
inconvenience
the
negro
no
race
can
wrong
another
race
simply
because
it
has
the
power
to
do
so
without
being
permanently
injured
in
its
own
morals
the
negro
can
endure
the
temporary
inconvenience
but
the
injury
to
the
white
man
is
permanent
it
is
for
the
white
man
to
save
himself
from
this
degradation
that
i
plead
if
a
white
man
steals
a
negro
ballot
it
is
the
white
man
who
is
permanently
injured
physical
death
comes
to
the
one
negro
lynched
in
a
county
but
death
of
the
morals
death
of
the
soul
comes
to
those
responsible
for
the
lynching
those
who
fought
and
died
on
the
battlefield
for
the
freedom
of
the
slaves
performed
their
duty
heroically
and
well
but
a
duty
remains
to
those
left
the
mere
fiat
of
law
can
not
make
an
ignorant
voter
an
intelligent
voter
can
not
make
a
dependent
man
an
independent
man
can
not
make
one
citizen
respect
another
these
results
will
come
to
the
negro
as
to
all
races
by
beginning
at
the
bottom
and
gradually
working
up
to
the
highest
possibilities
of
his
nature
in
the
economy
of
god
there
is
but
one
standard
by
which
an
individual
can
succeed
there
is
but
one
for
a
race
this
country
expects
that
every
race
shall
measure
itself
by
the
american
standard
during
the
next
and
more
the
negro
must
continue
passing
through
the
severe
american
crucible
he
is
to
be
tested
in
his
patience
his
forbearance
his
perseverance
his
power
to
endure
wrong
to
withstand
temptations
to
economise
to
acquire
and
use
skill
his
ability
to
compete
to
succeed
in
commerce
to
disregard
the
superficial
for
the
real
the
appearance
for
the
substance
to
be
great
and
yet
small
learned
and
yet
simple
high
and
yet
the
servant
of
all
this
this
is
the
passport
to
all
that
is
best
in
the
life
of
our
republic
and
the
negro
must
possess
it
or
be
barred
out
in
working
out
his
own
destiny
while
the
main
burden
of
activity
must
be
with
the
negro
he
will
need
in
the
years
to
come
as
he
has
needed
in
the
past
the
help
the
encouragement
the
guidance
that
the
strong
can
give
the
weak
thus
helped
those
of
both
races
in
the
south
will
soon
throw
off
the
shackles
of
racial
and
sectional
prejudice
and
rise
above
the
clouds
of
ignorance
narrowness
and
selfishness
into
that
atmosphere
that
pure
sunshine
where
it
will
be
the
highest
ambition
to
serve
man
our
brother
regardless
of
race
or
previous
condition
chapter
viii
before
ending
this
volume
i
have
deemed
it
wise
and
fitting
to
sum
up
in
the
following
chapter
all
that
i
have
attempted
to
say
in
the
previous
chapters
and
to
speak
at
the
same
time
a
little
more
definitely
about
the
negro
future
and
his
relation
to
the
white
race
all
attempts
to
settle
the
question
of
the
negro
in
the
south
by
his
removal
from
this
country
have
so
far
failed
and
i
think
that
they
are
likely
to
fail
the
next
census
will
probably
show
that
we
have
about
ten
millions
of
negroes
in
the
united
states
about
eight
millions
of
these
are
in
the
southern
states
we
have
almost
a
nation
within
a
nation
the
negro
population
within
the
united
states
lacks
but
two
millions
of
being
as
large
as
the
whole
population
of
mexico
it
is
nearly
twice
as
large
as
the
population
of
the
dominion
of
canada
it
is
equal
to
the
combined
population
of
switzerland
greece
honduras
nicaragua
cuba
uruguay
santo
domingo
paraguay
and
costa
rica
when
we
consider
in
connection
with
these
facts
that
the
race
has
doubled
itself
since
its
freedom
and
is
still
increasing
it
hardly
seems
possible
for
any
one
to
consider
seriously
any
scheme
of
emigration
from
america
as
a
method
of
solution
of
our
vexed
race
problem
at
most
even
if
the
government
were
to
provide
the
means
but
a
few
hundred
thousand
could
be
transported
each
year
the
yearly
increase
in
population
would
more
than
overbalance
the
number
transplanted
even
if
it
did
not
the
time
required
to
get
rid
of
the
negro
by
this
method
would
perhaps
be
fifty
or
years
the
idea
is
chimerical
some
have
advised
that
the
negro
leave
the
south
and
take
up
his
residence
in
the
northern
states
i
question
whether
this
would
leave
him
any
better
off
than
he
is
in
the
south
when
all
things
are
considered
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
study
the
condition
of
our
people
in
nearly
every
part
of
america
and
i
say
without
hesitation
that
with
some
exceptional
cases
the
negro
is
at
his
best
in
the
southern
states
while
he
enjoys
certain
privileges
in
the
north
that
he
does
not
have
in
the
south
when
it
comes
to
the
matter
of
securing
property
enjoying
business
opportunities
and
employment
the
south
presents
a
far
better
opportunity
than
the
north
few
coloured
men
from
the
south
are
as
yet
able
to
stand
up
against
the
severe
and
increasing
competition
that
exists
in
the
north
to
say
nothing
of
the
unfriendly
influence
of
labour
organisations
which
in
some
way
prevents
black
men
in
the
north
as
a
rule
from
securing
employment
in
skilled
labour
occupations
another
point
of
great
danger
for
the
coloured
man
who
goes
north
is
in
the
matter
of
morals
owing
to
the
numerous
temptations
by
which
he
finds
himself
surrounded
he
has
more
ways
in
which
he
can
spend
money
than
in
the
south
but
fewer
avenues
of
employment
are
open
to
him
the
fact
that
at
the
north
the
negro
is
confined
to
almost
one
line
of
employment
often
tends
to
discourage
and
demoralise
the
strongest
who
go
from
the
south
and
to
make
them
an
easy
prey
to
temptation
a
few
years
ago
i
made
an
examination
into
the
condition
of
a
settlement
of
negroes
who
left
the
south
and
went
to
kansas
about
twenty
years
ago
when
there
was
a
good
deal
of
excitement
in
the
south
concerning
emigration
to
the
west
this
settlement
i
found
was
much
below
the
standard
of
that
of
a
similar
number
of
our
people
in
the
south
the
only
conclusion
therefore
it
seems
to
me
which
any
one
can
reach
is
that
the
negroes
as
a
mass
are
to
remain
in
the
southern
states
as
a
race
they
do
not
want
to
leave
the
south
and
the
southern
white
people
do
not
want
them
to
leave
we
must
therefore
find
some
basis
of
settlement
that
will
be
constitutional
just
manly
that
will
be
fair
to
both
races
in
the
south
and
to
the
whole
country
this
can
not
be
done
in
a
day
a
year
or
any
short
period
of
time
we
can
it
seems
to
me
with
the
present
light
decide
upon
a
reasonably
safe
method
of
solving
the
problem
and
turn
our
strength
and
effort
in
that
direction
in
doing
this
i
would
not
have
the
negro
deprived
of
any
privilege
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
it
is
not
best
for
the
negro
that
he
relinquish
any
of
his
constitutional
rights
it
is
not
best
for
the
southern
white
man
that
he
should
in
order
that
we
may
without
loss
of
time
or
effort
concentrate
our
forces
in
a
wise
direction
i
suggest
what
seems
to
me
and
many
others
the
wisest
policy
to
be
pursued
i
have
reached
these
conclusions
by
reason
of
my
own
observations
and
experience
after
eighteen
years
of
direct
contact
with
the
leading
and
influential
coloured
and
white
men
in
most
parts
of
our
country
but
i
wish
first
to
mention
some
elements
of
danger
in
the
present
situation
which
all
who
desire
the
permanent
welfare
of
both
races
in
the
south
should
carefully
consider
there
is
danger
that
a
certain
class
of
impatient
extremists
among
the
negroes
who
have
little
knowledge
of
the
actual
conditions
in
the
south
may
do
the
entire
race
injury
by
attempting
to
advise
their
brethren
in
the
south
to
resort
to
armed
resistance
or
the
use
of
the
torch
in
order
to
secure
justice
all
intelligent
and
discussion
of
any
important
question
or
condemnation
of
any
wrong
both
in
the
north
and
the
south
from
the
public
platform
and
through
the
press
is
to
be
commended
and
encouraged
but
incendiary
utterances
from
black
men
in
the
north
will
tend
to
add
to
the
burdens
of
our
people
in
the
south
rather
than
relieve
them
another
danger
in
the
south
which
should
be
guarded
against
is
that
the
whole
white
south
including
the
wide
conservative
element
may
find
itself
represented
before
the
bar
of
public
opinion
by
the
mob
or
lawless
element
which
gives
expression
to
its
feelings
and
tendency
in
a
manner
that
advertises
the
south
throughout
the
world
too
often
those
who
have
no
sympathy
with
such
disregard
of
law
are
either
silent
or
fail
to
speak
in
a
sufficiently
emphatic
manner
to
offset
in
any
large
degree
the
unfortunate
reputation
which
the
lawless
have
too
often
made
for
many
portions
of
the
south
no
race
or
people
ever
got
upon
its
feet
without
severe
and
constant
struggle
often
in
the
face
of
the
greatest
discouragement
while
passing
through
the
present
trying
period
of
its
history
there
is
danger
that
a
large
and
valuable
element
of
the
negro
race
may
become
discouraged
in
the
effort
to
better
its
condition
every
possible
influence
should
be
exerted
to
prevent
this
there
is
a
possibility
that
harm
may
be
done
to
the
south
and
to
the
negro
by
exaggerated
newspaper
articles
which
are
written
near
the
scene
or
in
the
midst
of
specially
aggravating
occurrences
often
these
reports
are
written
by
newspaper
men
who
give
the
impression
that
there
is
a
race
conflict
throughout
the
south
and
that
all
southern
white
people
are
opposed
to
the
negro
progress
overlooking
the
fact
that
while
in
some
sections
there
is
trouble
in
most
parts
of
the
south
there
is
nevertheless
a
very
large
measure
of
peace
good
will
and
mutual
helpfulness
in
this
same
relation
much
can
be
done
to
retard
the
progress
of
the
negro
by
a
certain
class
of
southern
white
people
who
in
the
midst
of
excitement
speak
or
write
in
a
manner
that
gives
the
impression
that
all
negroes
are
lawless
untrustworthy
and
shiftless
as
an
example
a
southern
writer
said
not
long
ago
in
a
communication
to
the
new
york
even
in
small
towns
the
husband
can
not
venture
to
leave
his
wife
alone
for
an
hour
at
night
at
no
time
in
no
place
is
the
white
woman
safe
from
insults
and
assaults
of
these
creatures
these
statements
i
presume
represented
the
feelings
and
the
conditions
that
existed
at
the
time
they
were
written
in
one
community
or
county
in
the
south
but
thousands
of
southern
white
men
and
women
would
be
ready
to
testify
that
this
is
not
the
condition
throughout
the
south
nor
throughout
any
one
state
under
the
next
head
i
would
mention
that
owing
to
the
lack
of
school
opportunities
for
the
negro
in
the
rural
districts
of
the
south
there
is
danger
that
ignorance
and
idleness
may
increase
to
the
extent
of
giving
the
negro
race
a
reputation
for
crime
and
that
immorality
may
eat
its
way
into
the
moral
fibre
of
the
race
so
as
to
retard
its
progress
for
many
years
in
judging
the
negro
in
this
regard
we
must
not
be
too
harsh
we
must
remember
that
it
has
only
been
within
the
last
years
that
the
black
father
and
mother
have
had
the
responsibility
and
consequently
the
experience
of
training
their
own
children
that
they
have
not
reached
perfection
in
one
generation
with
the
obstacles
that
the
parents
have
been
compelled
to
overcome
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
as
a
final
source
of
danger
to
be
guarded
against
i
would
mention
my
fear
that
some
of
the
white
people
of
the
south
may
be
led
to
feel
that
the
way
to
settle
the
race
problem
is
to
repress
the
aspirations
of
the
negro
by
legislation
of
a
kind
that
confers
certain
legal
or
political
privileges
upon
an
ignorant
and
poor
white
man
and
withholds
the
same
privileges
from
a
black
man
in
the
same
condition
such
legislation
injures
and
retards
the
progress
of
both
races
it
is
an
injustice
to
the
poor
white
man
because
it
takes
from
him
incentive
to
secure
education
and
property
as
prerequisites
for
voting
he
feels
that
because
he
is
a
white
man
regardless
of
his
possessions
a
way
will
be
found
for
him
to
vote
i
would
label
all
such
measures
laws
to
keep
the
poor
white
man
in
ignorance
and
poverty
as
the
talladega
a
democratic
newspaper
of
alabama
recently
said
but
it
is
a
weak
cry
when
the
white
man
asks
odds
on
intelligence
over
the
negro
when
nature
has
already
so
handicapped
the
african
in
the
race
for
knowledge
the
cry
of
the
boasted
for
still
further
odds
seems
babyish
what
wonder
that
the
world
looks
on
in
surprise
if
not
disgust
it
can
not
help
but
say
if
our
contention
be
true
that
the
negro
is
an
inferior
race
that
the
odds
ought
to
be
on
the
other
side
if
any
are
to
be
given
and
why
not
no
the
thing
to
do
the
only
thing
that
will
stand
the
test
of
time
is
to
do
right
exactly
right
let
come
what
will
and
that
right
thing
as
it
seems
to
me
is
to
place
a
fair
educational
qualification
before
every
citizen
one
that
is
and
not
dependent
on
the
wishes
of
weak
men
letting
all
who
pass
the
test
stand
in
the
proud
ranks
of
american
voters
whose
votes
shall
be
counted
as
cast
and
whose
sovereign
will
shall
be
maintained
as
law
by
all
the
powers
that
be
nothing
short
of
this
will
do
every
exemption
on
whatsoever
ground
is
an
outrage
that
can
only
rob
some
legitimate
voter
of
his
rights
such
laws
as
have
been
made
as
an
example
in
mississippi
with
the
understanding
clause
hold
out
a
temptation
for
the
election
officer
to
perjure
and
degrade
himself
by
too
often
deciding
that
the
ignorant
white
man
does
understand
the
constitution
when
it
is
read
to
him
and
that
the
ignorant
black
man
does
not
by
such
a
law
the
state
not
only
commits
a
wrong
against
its
black
citizens
it
injures
the
morals
of
its
white
citizens
by
conferring
such
a
power
upon
any
white
man
who
may
happen
to
be
a
judge
of
elections
such
laws
are
hurtful
again
because
they
keep
alive
in
the
heart
of
the
black
man
the
feeling
that
the
white
man
means
to
oppress
him
the
only
safe
way
out
is
to
set
a
high
standard
as
a
test
of
citizenship
and
require
blacks
and
whites
alike
to
come
up
to
it
when
this
is
done
both
will
have
a
higher
respect
for
the
election
laws
and
those
who
make
them
i
do
not
believe
that
with
his
centuries
of
advantage
over
the
negro
in
the
opportunity
to
acquire
property
and
education
as
prerequisites
for
voting
the
average
white
man
in
the
south
desires
that
any
special
law
be
passed
to
give
him
advantage
over
the
negro
who
has
had
only
a
little
more
than
thirty
years
in
which
to
prepare
himself
for
citizenship
in
this
relation
another
point
of
danger
is
that
the
negro
has
been
made
to
feel
that
it
is
his
duty
to
oppose
continually
the
southern
white
man
in
politics
even
in
matters
where
no
principle
is
involved
and
that
he
is
only
loyal
to
his
own
race
and
acting
in
a
manly
way
when
he
is
opposing
him
such
a
policy
has
proved
most
hurtful
to
both
races
where
it
is
a
matter
of
principle
where
a
question
of
right
or
wrong
is
involved
i
would
advise
the
negro
to
stand
by
principle
at
all
hazards
a
southern
white
man
has
no
respect
for
or
confidence
in
a
negro
who
acts
merely
for
sake
but
there
are
many
cases
and
the
number
is
growing
where
the
negro
has
nothing
to
gain
and
much
to
lose
by
opposing
the
southern
white
man
in
many
matters
that
relate
to
government
under
these
six
heads
i
believe
i
have
stated
some
of
the
main
points
which
all
white
men
and
black
men
north
and
south
will
agree
need
our
most
earnest
and
thoughtful
consideration
if
we
would
hasten
and
not
hinder
the
progress
of
our
country
as
to
the
policy
that
should
be
pursued
in
a
larger
sense
on
this
subject
i
claim
to
possess
no
superior
wisdom
or
unusual
insight
i
may
be
wrong
i
may
be
in
some
degree
right
in
the
future
more
than
in
the
past
we
want
to
impress
upon
the
negro
the
importance
of
identifying
himself
more
closely
with
the
interests
of
the
south
the
importance
of
making
himself
part
of
the
south
and
at
home
in
it
heretofore
for
reasons
which
were
natural
and
for
which
no
one
is
especially
to
blame
the
coloured
people
have
been
too
much
like
a
foreign
nation
residing
in
the
midst
of
another
nation
if
william
lloyd
garrison
wendell
phillips
and
george
stearns
were
alive
i
feel
sure
that
each
one
of
them
would
advise
the
negroes
to
identify
their
interests
as
far
as
possible
with
those
of
the
southern
white
man
always
with
the
understanding
that
this
should
be
done
where
no
question
of
right
and
wrong
is
involved
in
no
other
way
it
seems
to
me
can
we
get
a
foundation
for
peace
and
progress
he
who
advises
against
this
policy
will
advise
the
negro
to
do
that
which
no
people
in
history
who
have
succeeded
have
done
the
white
man
north
or
south
who
advises
the
negro
against
it
advises
him
to
do
that
which
he
himself
has
not
done
the
upon
which
every
individual
rests
his
chances
of
success
in
life
is
securing
the
friendship
the
confidence
the
respect
of
his
neighbour
of
the
little
community
in
which
he
lives
almost
the
whole
problem
of
the
negro
in
the
south
rests
itself
upon
the
fact
as
to
whether
the
negro
can
make
himself
of
such
indispensable
service
to
his
neighbour
and
the
community
that
no
one
can
fill
his
place
better
in
the
body
politic
there
is
at
present
no
other
safe
course
for
the
black
man
to
pursue
if
the
negro
in
the
south
has
a
friend
in
his
white
neighbour
and
a
still
larger
number
of
friends
in
his
community
he
has
a
protection
and
a
guarantee
of
his
rights
that
will
be
more
potent
and
more
lasting
than
any
our
federal
congress
or
any
outside
power
can
confer
in
a
recent
editorial
the
london
in
discussing
affairs
in
the
transvaal
south
africa
where
englishmen
have
been
denied
certain
privileges
by
the
boers
says
england
is
too
sagacious
not
to
prefer
a
gradual
reform
from
within
even
should
it
be
less
rapid
than
most
of
us
might
wish
to
the
most
sweeping
redress
of
grievances
imposed
from
without
our
object
is
to
obtain
fair
play
for
the
outlanders
but
the
best
way
to
do
it
is
to
enable
them
to
help
themselves
this
policy
i
think
is
equally
safe
when
applied
to
conditions
in
the
south
the
foreigner
who
comes
to
america
as
soon
as
possible
identifies
himself
in
business
education
politics
and
sympathy
with
the
community
in
which
he
settles
as
i
have
said
we
have
a
conspicuous
example
of
this
in
the
case
of
the
jews
also
the
negro
in
cuba
has
practically
settled
the
race
question
there
because
he
has
made
himself
a
part
of
cuba
in
thought
and
action
what
i
have
tried
to
indicate
can
not
be
accomplished
by
any
sudden
revolution
of
methods
but
it
does
seem
that
the
tendency
more
and
more
should
be
in
this
direction
if
a
practical
example
is
wanted
in
the
direction
that
i
favour
i
will
mention
one
the
north
sends
thousands
of
dollars
into
the
south
each
year
for
the
education
of
the
negro
the
teachers
in
most
of
the
academic
schools
of
the
south
are
supported
by
the
north
or
northern
men
and
women
of
the
highest
christian
culture
and
most
unselfish
devotion
the
negro
owes
them
a
debt
of
gratitude
which
can
never
be
paid
the
various
missionary
societies
in
the
north
have
done
a
work
which
in
a
large
degree
has
been
the
salvation
of
the
south
and
the
result
will
appear
in
future
generations
more
than
in
this
we
have
now
reached
the
point
in
the
south
where
i
believe
great
good
could
be
accomplished
by
changing
the
attitude
of
the
white
people
toward
the
negro
and
of
the
negro
toward
the
whites
if
a
few
white
teachers
of
high
character
would
take
an
active
interest
in
the
work
of
these
high
schools
can
this
be
done
yes
the
medical
school
connected
with
shaw
university
at
raleigh
north
carolina
has
from
the
first
had
as
instructors
and
professors
almost
exclusively
southern
white
doctors
who
reside
in
raleigh
and
they
have
given
the
highest
satisfaction
this
gives
the
people
of
raleigh
the
feeling
that
this
is
their
school
and
not
something
located
in
but
not
a
part
of
the
south
in
augusta
georgia
the
payne
institute
one
of
the
best
colleges
for
our
people
is
officered
and
taught
almost
wholly
by
southern
white
men
and
women
the
presbyterian
theological
school
at
tuscaloosa
alabama
has
all
southern
white
men
as
instructors
some
time
ago
at
the
calhoun
school
in
alabama
one
of
the
leading
white
men
in
the
county
was
given
an
important
position
in
the
school
since
then
the
feeling
of
the
white
people
in
the
county
has
greatly
changed
toward
the
school
we
must
admit
the
stern
fact
that
at
present
the
negro
through
no
choice
of
his
own
is
living
among
another
race
which
is
far
ahead
of
him
in
education
property
experience
and
favourable
condition
further
that
the
negro
present
condition
makes
him
dependent
upon
the
white
people
for
most
of
the
things
necessary
to
sustain
life
as
well
as
for
his
common
school
education
in
all
history
those
who
have
possessed
the
property
and
intelligence
have
exercised
the
greatest
control
in
government
regardless
of
colour
race
or
geographical
location
this
being
the
case
how
can
the
black
man
in
the
south
improve
his
present
condition
and
does
the
southern
white
man
want
him
to
improve
it
the
negro
in
the
south
has
it
within
his
power
if
he
properly
utilises
the
forces
at
hand
to
make
of
himself
such
a
valuable
factor
in
the
life
of
the
south
that
he
will
not
have
to
seek
privileges
they
will
be
freely
conferred
upon
him
to
bring
this
about
the
negro
must
begin
at
the
bottom
and
lay
a
sure
foundation
and
not
be
lured
by
any
temptation
into
trying
to
rise
on
a
false
foundation
while
the
negro
is
laying
this
foundation
he
will
need
help
sympathy
and
simple
justice
progress
by
any
other
method
will
be
but
temporary
and
superficial
and
the
latter
end
of
it
will
be
worse
than
the
beginning
american
slavery
was
a
great
curse
to
both
races
and
i
would
be
the
last
to
apologise
for
it
but
in
the
presence
of
god
i
believe
that
slavery
laid
the
foundation
for
the
solution
of
the
problem
that
is
now
before
us
in
the
south
during
slavery
the
negro
was
taught
every
trade
every
industry
that
constitutes
the
foundation
for
making
a
living
now
if
on
this
foundation
laid
in
rather
a
crude
way
it
is
true
but
a
foundation
nevertheless
we
can
gradually
build
and
improve
the
future
for
us
is
bright
let
me
be
more
specific
agriculture
is
or
has
been
the
basic
industry
of
nearly
every
race
or
nation
that
has
succeeded
the
negro
got
a
knowledge
of
this
during
slavery
hence
in
a
large
measure
he
is
in
possession
of
this
industry
in
the
south
the
negro
can
buy
land
in
the
south
as
a
rule
wherever
the
white
man
can
buy
it
and
at
very
low
prices
now
since
the
bulk
of
our
people
already
have
a
foundation
in
agriculture
they
are
at
their
best
when
living
in
the
country
engaged
in
agricultural
pursuits
plainly
then
the
best
thing
the
logical
thing
is
to
turn
the
larger
part
of
our
strength
in
a
direction
that
will
make
the
negro
among
the
most
skilled
agricultural
people
in
the
world
the
man
who
has
learned
to
do
something
better
than
any
one
else
has
learned
to
do
a
common
thing
in
an
uncommon
manner
is
the
man
who
has
a
power
and
influence
that
no
adverse
circumstances
can
take
from
him
the
negro
who
can
make
himself
so
conspicuous
as
a
successful
farmer
a
large
a
wise
helper
of
his
as
to
be
placed
in
a
position
of
trust
and
honour
whether
the
position
be
political
or
otherwise
by
natural
selection
is
a
more
secure
in
that
position
than
one
placed
there
by
mere
outside
force
or
pressure
i
know
a
negro
hon
isaiah
montgomery
in
mississippi
who
is
mayor
of
a
town
it
is
true
that
this
town
at
present
is
composed
almost
wholly
of
negroes
montgomery
is
mayor
of
this
town
because
his
genius
thrift
and
foresight
have
created
the
town
and
he
is
held
and
supported
in
his
office
by
a
charter
granted
by
the
state
of
mississippi
and
by
the
vote
and
public
sentiment
of
the
community
in
which
he
lives
let
us
help
the
negro
by
every
means
possible
to
acquire
such
an
education
in
farming
dairying
horticulture
as
will
enable
him
to
become
a
model
in
these
respects
and
place
him
near
the
top
in
these
industries
and
the
race
problem
would
in
a
large
part
be
settled
or
at
least
stripped
of
many
of
its
most
perplexing
elements
this
policy
would
also
tend
to
keep
the
negro
in
the
country
and
smaller
towns
where
he
succeeds
best
and
stop
the
influx
into
the
large
cities
where
he
does
not
succeed
so
well
the
race
like
the
individual
that
produces
something
of
superior
worth
that
has
a
common
human
interest
makes
a
permanent
place
for
itself
and
is
bound
to
be
recognised
at
a
county
fair
in
the
south
not
long
ago
i
saw
a
negro
awarded
the
first
prize
by
a
jury
of
white
men
over
white
competitors
for
the
production
of
the
best
specimen
of
indian
corn
every
white
man
at
this
fair
seemed
to
be
pleased
and
proud
of
the
achievement
of
this
negro
because
it
was
apparent
that
he
had
done
something
that
would
add
to
the
wealth
and
comfort
of
the
people
of
both
races
in
that
county
at
the
tuskegee
normal
and
industrial
institute
in
alabama
we
have
a
department
devoted
to
training
men
in
the
science
of
agriculture
but
what
we
are
doing
is
small
when
compared
with
what
should
be
done
at
tuskegee
and
at
other
educational
centres
in
a
material
sense
the
south
is
still
an
undeveloped
country
while
race
prejudice
is
strongly
exhibited
in
many
directions
in
the
matter
of
business
of
commercial
and
industrial
development
there
is
very
little
obstacle
in
the
negro
way
a
negro
who
produces
or
has
for
sale
something
that
the
community
wants
finds
customers
among
white
people
as
well
as
black
people
a
negro
can
borrow
money
at
the
bank
with
equal
security
as
readily
as
a
white
man
can
a
bank
in
birmingham
alabama
that
has
now
existed
ten
years
is
officered
and
controlled
wholly
by
negroes
this
bank
has
white
borrowers
and
white
depositors
a
graduate
of
the
tuskegee
institute
keeps
a
grocery
store
in
tuskegee
and
he
tells
me
that
he
sells
about
as
many
goods
to
the
one
race
as
to
the
other
what
i
have
said
of
the
opening
that
awaits
the
negro
in
the
direction
of
agriculture
is
almost
equally
true
of
mechanics
manufacturing
and
all
the
domestic
arts
the
field
is
before
him
and
right
about
him
will
he
occupy
it
will
he
cast
down
his
bucket
where
he
is
will
his
friends
north
and
south
encourage
him
and
prepare
him
to
occupy
it
every
city
in
the
south
for
example
would
give
support
to
a
architect
or
or
contractor
of
our
race
the
architect
and
contractor
would
not
only
receive
support
but
through
his
example
numbers
of
young
coloured
men
would
learn
such
trades
as
carpentry
plastering
painting
and
the
race
would
be
put
into
a
position
to
hold
on
to
many
of
the
industries
which
it
is
now
in
danger
of
losing
because
in
too
many
cases
brains
skill
and
dignity
are
not
imparted
to
the
common
occupations
of
life
that
are
about
his
very
door
any
individual
or
race
that
does
not
fit
itself
to
occupy
in
the
best
manner
the
field
or
service
that
is
right
about
it
will
sooner
or
later
be
asked
to
move
on
and
let
some
one
else
occupy
it
but
it
is
asked
would
you
confine
the
negro
to
agriculture
mechanics
and
domestic
arts
not
at
all
but
along
the
lines
that
i
have
mentioned
is
where
the
stress
should
be
laid
just
now
and
for
many
years
to
come
we
will
need
and
must
have
many
teachers
and
ministers
some
doctors
and
lawyers
and
statesmen
but
these
professional
men
will
have
a
constituency
or
a
foundation
from
which
to
draw
support
just
in
proportion
as
the
race
prospers
along
the
economic
lines
that
i
have
mentioned
during
the
first
fifty
or
one
hundred
years
of
the
life
of
any
people
are
not
the
economic
occupations
always
given
the
greater
attention
this
is
not
only
the
historic
but
i
think
the
view
if
this
generation
will
lay
the
material
foundation
it
will
be
the
quickest
and
surest
way
for
the
succeeding
generation
to
succeed
in
the
cultivation
of
the
fine
arts
and
to
surround
itself
even
with
some
of
the
luxuries
of
life
if
desired
what
the
race
now
most
needs
in
my
opinion
is
a
whole
army
of
men
and
women
well
trained
to
lead
and
at
the
same
time
infuse
themselves
into
agriculture
mechanics
domestic
employment
and
business
as
to
the
mental
training
that
these
educated
leaders
should
be
equipped
with
i
should
say
give
them
all
the
mental
training
and
culture
that
the
circumstances
of
individuals
will
allow
the
more
the
better
no
race
can
permanently
succeed
until
its
mind
is
awakened
and
strengthened
by
the
ripest
thought
but
i
would
constantly
have
it
kept
in
the
thoughts
of
those
who
are
educated
in
books
that
a
large
proportion
of
those
who
are
educated
should
be
so
trained
in
hand
that
they
can
bring
this
mental
strength
and
knowledge
to
bear
upon
the
physical
conditions
in
the
south
which
i
have
tried
to
emphasise
frederick
douglass
of
sainted
memory
once
in
addressing
his
race
used
these
words
we
are
to
prove
that
we
can
better
our
own
condition
one
way
to
do
this
is
to
accumulate
property
this
may
sound
to
you
like
a
new
gospel
you
have
been
accustomed
to
hear
that
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
etc
on
the
other
hand
property
money
if
you
please
will
purchase
for
us
the
only
condition
by
which
any
people
can
rise
to
the
dignity
of
genuine
manhood
for
without
property
there
can
be
no
leisure
without
leisure
there
can
be
no
thought
without
thought
there
can
be
no
invention
without
invention
there
can
be
no
progress
the
negro
should
be
taught
that
material
development
is
not
an
end
but
simply
a
means
to
an
end
as
professor
dubois
puts
it
the
idea
should
not
be
simply
to
make
men
carpenters
but
to
make
carpenters
men
the
negro
has
a
highly
religious
temperament
but
what
he
needs
more
and
more
is
to
be
convinced
of
the
importance
of
weaving
his
religion
and
morality
into
the
practical
affairs
of
daily
life
equally
as
much
does
he
need
to
be
taught
to
put
so
much
intelligence
into
his
labour
that
he
will
see
dignity
and
beauty
in
the
occupation
and
love
it
for
its
own
sake
the
negro
needs
to
be
taught
that
more
of
the
religion
that
manifests
itself
in
his
happiness
in
the
should
be
made
practical
in
the
performance
of
his
daily
task
the
man
who
owns
a
home
and
is
in
the
possession
of
the
elements
by
which
he
is
sure
of
making
a
daily
living
has
a
great
aid
to
a
moral
and
religious
life
what
bearing
will
all
this
have
upon
the
negro
place
in
the
south
as
a
citizen
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
privileges
which
our
government
confers
to
state
in
detail
just
what
place
the
black
man
will
occupy
in
the
south
as
a
citizen
when
he
has
developed
in
the
direction
named
is
beyond
the
wisdom
of
any
one
much
will
depend
upon
the
sense
of
justice
which
can
be
kept
alive
in
the
breast
of
the
american
people
almost
as
much
will
depend
upon
the
good
sense
of
the
negro
himself
that
question
i
confess
does
not
give
me
the
most
concern
just
now
the
important
and
pressing
question
is
will
the
negro
with
his
own
help
and
that
of
his
friends
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
now
surround
him
when
he
has
done
this
i
believe
that
speaking
of
his
future
in
general
terms
he
will
be
treated
with
justice
will
be
given
the
protection
of
the
law
and
will
be
given
the
recognition
in
a
large
measure
which
his
usefulness
and
ability
warrant
if
fifty
years
ago
any
one
had
predicted
that
the
negro
would
have
received
the
recognition
and
honour
which
individuals
have
already
received
he
would
have
been
laughed
at
as
an
idle
dreamer
time
patience
and
constant
achievement
are
great
factors
in
the
rise
of
a
race
i
do
not
believe
that
the
world
ever
takes
a
race
seriously
in
its
desire
to
enter
into
the
control
of
the
government
of
a
nation
in
any
large
degree
until
a
large
number
of
individuals
members
of
that
race
have
demonstrated
beyond
question
their
ability
to
control
and
develop
individual
business
enterprises
when
a
number
of
negroes
rise
to
the
point
where
they
own
and
operate
the
most
successful
farms
are
among
the
largest
in
their
county
are
moral
and
intelligent
i
do
not
believe
that
in
many
portions
of
the
south
such
men
need
long
be
denied
the
right
of
saying
by
their
votes
how
they
prefer
their
property
to
be
taxed
and
in
choosing
those
who
are
to
make
and
administer
the
laws
in
a
certain
town
in
the
south
recently
i
was
on
the
street
in
company
with
the
most
prominent
negro
in
the
town
while
we
were
together
the
mayor
of
the
town
sought
out
the
black
man
and
said
next
week
we
are
going
to
vote
on
the
question
of
issuing
bonds
to
secure
for
this
town
you
must
be
sure
to
vote
on
the
day
of
election
the
mayor
did
not
suggest
whether
he
must
vote
yes
or
no
he
knew
from
the
very
fact
that
this
negro
man
owned
nearly
a
block
of
the
most
valuable
property
in
the
town
that
he
would
cast
a
safe
wise
vote
on
this
important
proposition
this
white
man
knew
that
because
of
this
negro
property
interests
in
the
city
he
would
cast
his
vote
in
the
way
he
thought
would
benefit
every
white
and
black
citizen
in
the
town
and
not
be
controlled
by
influences
a
thousand
miles
away
but
a
short
time
ago
i
read
letters
from
nearly
every
prominent
white
man
in
birmingham
alabama
asking
that
the
rev
pettiford
a
negro
be
appointed
to
a
certain
important
federal
office
what
is
the
explanation
of
this
pettiford
for
nine
years
has
been
the
president
of
the
negro
bank
in
birmingham
to
which
i
have
alluded
during
these
nine
years
these
white
citizens
have
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
that
pettiford
could
manage
successfully
a
private
business
and
that
he
had
proven
himself
a
conservative
thoughtful
citizen
and
they
were
willing
to
trust
him
in
a
public
office
such
individual
examples
will
have
to
be
multiplied
until
they
become
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
while
we
are
multiplying
these
examples
the
negro
must
keep
a
strong
and
courageous
heart
he
can
not
improve
his
condition
by
any
course
or
by
artificial
methods
above
all
he
must
not
be
deluded
into
the
temptation
of
believing
that
his
condition
can
be
permanently
improved
by
a
mere
battledore
and
shuttlecock
of
words
or
by
any
process
of
mere
mental
gymnastics
or
oratory
alone
what
is
desired
along
with
a
logical
defence
of
his
cause
are
deeds
results
multiplied
results
in
the
direction
of
building
himself
up
so
as
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
any
one
of
his
ability
to
succeed
an
important
question
often
asked
is
does
the
white
man
in
the
south
want
the
negro
to
improve
his
present
condition
i
say
yes
from
the
montgomery
alabama
i
clip
the
following
in
reference
to
the
closing
of
a
coloured
school
in
a
town
in
alabama
eufaula
may
the
closing
exercises
of
the
city
coloured
public
school
were
held
at
luke
church
last
night
and
were
witnessed
by
a
large
gathering
including
many
white
the
recitations
by
the
pupils
were
excellent
and
the
music
was
also
an
interesting
feature
rev
pollard
delivered
the
address
which
was
quite
an
able
one
and
the
certificates
were
presented
by
professor
mccoy
white
of
the
sanford
street
school
the
success
of
the
exercises
reflects
great
credit
on
professor
murphy
the
principal
who
enjoys
a
deservedly
good
reputation
as
a
capable
and
efficient
educator
i
quote
this
report
not
because
it
is
the
exception
but
because
such
marks
of
interest
in
the
education
of
the
negro
on
the
part
of
the
southern
white
people
can
be
seen
almost
every
day
in
the
local
papers
why
should
white
people
by
their
presence
words
and
many
other
things
encourage
the
black
man
to
get
education
if
they
do
not
desire
him
to
improve
his
condition
the
payne
institute
in
augusta
georgia
an
excellent
institution
to
which
i
have
already
referred
is
supported
almost
wholly
by
the
southern
white
methodist
church
the
southern
white
presbyterians
support
a
theological
school
at
tuscaloosa
alabama
for
negroes
for
a
number
of
years
the
southern
white
baptists
have
contributed
toward
negro
education
other
denominations
have
done
the
same
if
these
people
do
not
want
the
negro
educated
to
a
high
standard
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
act
the
hypocrite
in
these
matters
as
barbarous
as
some
of
the
lynchings
in
the
south
have
been
southern
white
men
here
and
there
as
well
as
newspapers
have
spoken
out
strongly
against
lynching
i
quote
from
the
address
of
the
rev
vance
of
nashville
tennessee
delivered
before
the
national
sunday
school
union
in
atlanta
not
long
since
as
an
example
and
yet
as
i
stand
here
a
southerner
speaking
for
my
section
and
addressing
an
audience
from
all
sections
there
is
one
foul
blot
upon
the
fair
fame
of
the
south
at
the
bare
mention
of
which
the
heart
turns
sick
and
the
cheek
is
crimsoned
with
shame
i
want
to
lift
my
voice
in
loud
and
long
and
indignant
protest
against
the
awful
horror
of
mob
violence
which
the
other
day
reached
the
climax
of
its
madness
and
infamy
in
a
deed
as
black
and
brutal
and
barbarous
as
can
be
found
in
the
annals
of
human
crime
i
have
a
right
to
speak
on
the
subject
and
i
propose
to
be
heard
the
time
has
come
for
every
lover
of
the
south
to
set
the
might
of
an
angered
and
resolute
manhood
against
the
shame
and
peril
of
the
lynch
demon
these
people
whose
fiendish
glee
taunts
their
victim
as
his
flesh
crackles
in
the
flames
do
not
represent
the
south
i
have
not
a
syllable
of
apology
for
the
sickening
crime
they
meant
to
avenge
but
it
is
high
time
we
were
learning
that
lawlessness
is
no
remedy
for
crime
for
one
i
dare
to
believe
that
the
people
of
my
section
are
able
to
cope
with
crime
however
treacherous
and
defiant
through
their
courts
of
justice
and
i
plead
for
the
masterful
sway
of
a
righteous
and
exalted
public
sentiment
that
shall
class
lynch
law
in
the
category
with
crime
it
is
a
notable
and
praiseworthy
fact
that
no
negro
educated
in
any
of
our
larger
institutions
of
learning
in
the
south
has
been
charged
with
any
of
the
recent
crimes
connected
with
assaults
upon
females
if
we
go
on
making
progress
in
the
directions
that
i
have
tried
to
indicate
more
and
more
the
south
will
be
drawn
to
one
course
as
i
have
already
said
it
is
not
for
the
best
interests
of
the
white
race
of
the
south
that
the
negro
be
deprived
of
any
privilege
guaranteed
him
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
this
would
put
upon
the
south
a
burden
under
which
no
government
could
stand
and
prosper
every
article
in
our
federal
constitution
was
placed
there
with
a
view
of
stimulating
and
encouraging
the
highest
type
of
citizenship
to
permanently
tax
the
negro
without
giving
him
the
right
to
vote
as
fast
as
he
qualifies
himself
in
education
and
property
for
voting
would
work
the
alienation
of
the
affections
of
the
negro
from
the
states
in
which
he
lives
and
would
be
the
reversal
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
government
for
which
our
states
have
stood
in
other
ways
than
this
the
injury
would
be
as
great
to
the
white
man
as
to
the
negro
taxation
without
the
hope
of
becoming
a
voter
would
take
away
from
the
citizens
of
the
gulf
states
their
interest
in
government
and
their
stimulant
to
become
or
to
secure
education
and
thus
be
able
and
willing
to
bear
their
share
of
the
cost
of
education
and
government
which
now
weighs
so
heavily
upon
the
white
of
the
south
the
more
the
negro
is
stimulated
and
encouraged
the
sooner
will
he
be
able
to
bear
a
larger
share
of
the
burdens
of
the
south
we
have
recently
had
before
us
an
example
in
the
case
of
spain
of
a
government
that
left
a
large
portion
of
its
citizens
in
ignorance
and
neglected
their
highest
interests
as
i
have
said
elsewhere
there
is
no
escape
through
law
of
man
or
god
from
the
inevitable
the
laws
of
changeless
justice
bind
oppressor
with
opprest
and
close
as
sin
and
suffering
joined
we
march
to
fate
abreast
nearly
sixteen
millions
of
hands
will
aid
you
in
pulling
the
load
upward
or
they
will
pull
against
you
the
load
downward
we
shall
constitute
and
more
of
the
ignorance
and
crime
of
the
south
or
its
intelligence
and
progress
we
shall
contribute
to
the
business
and
industrial
prosperity
of
the
south
or
we
shall
prove
a
veritable
body
of
death
stagnating
depressing
retarding
every
effort
to
advance
the
body
politic
my
own
feeling
is
that
the
south
will
gradually
reach
the
point
where
it
will
see
the
wisdom
and
the
justice
of
enacting
an
educational
or
property
qualification
or
both
for
voting
that
shall
be
made
to
apply
honestly
to
both
races
the
industrial
development
of
the
negro
in
connection
with
education
and
christian
character
will
help
to
hasten
this
end
when
this
is
done
we
shall
have
a
foundation
in
my
opinion
upon
which
to
build
a
government
that
is
honest
and
that
will
be
in
a
high
degree
satisfactory
to
both
races
i
do
not
suffer
myself
to
take
too
optimistic
a
view
of
the
conditions
in
the
south
the
problem
is
a
large
and
serious
one
and
will
require
the
patient
help
sympathy
and
advice
of
our
most
patriotic
citizens
north
and
south
for
years
to
come
but
i
believe
that
if
the
principles
which
i
have
tried
to
indicate
are
followed
a
solution
of
the
question
will
come
so
long
as
the
negro
is
permitted
to
get
education
acquire
property
and
secure
employment
and
is
treated
with
respect
in
the
business
or
commercial
world
as
is
now
true
in
the
greater
part
of
the
south
i
shall
have
the
greatest
faith
in
his
working
out
his
own
destiny
in
our
southern
states
the
education
and
preparing
for
citizenship
of
nearly
eight
millions
of
people
is
a
tremendous
task
and
every
lover
of
humanity
should
count
it
a
privilege
to
help
in
the
solution
of
a
great
problem
for
which
our
whole
country
is
responsible
