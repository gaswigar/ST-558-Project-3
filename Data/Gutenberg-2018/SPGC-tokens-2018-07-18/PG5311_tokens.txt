parnassus
on
wheels
by
christopher
morley
to
and
trusty
dusky
vivid
true
a
letter
to
david
grayson
esq
of
hempfield
my
dear
sir
although
my
name
appears
on
the
title
page
the
real
author
of
this
book
is
miss
helen
mcgill
now
roger
mifflin
who
told
me
the
story
with
her
own
inimitable
vivacity
and
on
her
behalf
i
want
to
send
to
you
these
few
words
of
acknowledgment
mifflin
i
need
hardly
say
is
unskilled
in
the
arts
of
authorship
this
is
her
first
book
and
i
doubt
whether
she
will
ever
write
another
she
hardly
realized
i
think
how
much
her
story
owes
to
your
own
delightful
writings
there
used
to
be
a
copy
of
adventures
in
contentment
on
her
table
at
the
sabine
farm
and
i
have
seen
her
pick
it
up
after
a
long
day
in
the
kitchen
read
it
with
chuckles
and
say
that
the
story
of
you
and
harriet
reminded
her
of
herself
and
andrew
she
used
to
mutter
something
about
adventures
in
discontentment
and
ask
why
side
of
the
matter
was
never
told
and
so
when
her
own
adventure
came
to
pass
and
she
was
urged
to
put
it
on
paper
i
think
she
unconsciously
adopted
something
of
the
manner
and
matter
that
you
have
made
properly
yours
surely
sir
you
will
not
disown
so
innocent
a
tribute
at
any
rate
miss
harriet
grayson
whose
excellent
qualities
we
have
all
so
long
admired
will
find
in
mifflin
a
kindred
spirit
mifflin
would
have
said
this
for
herself
with
her
characteristic
definiteness
of
speech
had
she
not
been
out
of
touch
with
her
publishers
and
foolscap
paper
she
and
the
professor
are
on
their
parnassus
somewhere
on
the
high
roads
happily
engrossed
in
the
most
godly
diversion
known
to
man
selling
books
and
i
venture
to
think
that
there
are
no
volumes
they
take
more
pleasure
in
recommending
than
the
wholesome
and
invigorating
books
which
bear
your
name
believe
me
dear
grayson
with
warm
regards
faithfully
yours
christopher
morley
chapter
one
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
lot
of
bunkum
in
higher
education
i
never
found
that
people
who
were
learned
in
logarithms
and
other
kinds
of
poetry
were
any
quicker
in
washing
dishes
or
darning
socks
done
a
good
deal
of
reading
when
i
could
and
i
do
want
to
admit
impediments
to
the
love
of
books
but
i
also
seen
lots
of
good
practical
folk
spoiled
by
too
much
fine
print
reading
sonnets
always
gives
me
hiccups
too
i
never
expected
to
be
an
author
but
i
do
think
there
are
some
amusing
things
about
the
story
of
andrew
and
myself
and
how
books
broke
up
our
placid
life
when
john
gutenberg
whose
real
name
so
the
professor
says
was
john
gooseflesh
borrowed
that
money
to
set
up
his
printing
press
he
launched
a
lot
of
troubles
on
the
world
andrew
and
i
were
wonderfully
happy
on
the
farm
until
he
became
an
author
if
i
could
have
foreseen
all
the
bother
his
writings
were
to
cause
us
i
would
certainly
have
burnt
the
first
manuscript
in
the
kitchen
stove
andrew
mcgill
the
author
of
those
books
every
one
reads
is
my
brother
in
other
words
i
am
his
sister
ten
years
younger
years
ago
andrew
was
a
business
man
but
his
health
failed
and
like
so
many
people
in
the
story
books
he
fled
to
the
country
or
as
he
called
it
to
the
bosom
of
nature
he
and
i
were
the
only
ones
left
in
an
unsuccessful
family
i
was
slowly
perishing
as
a
conscientious
governess
in
the
brownstone
region
of
new
york
he
rescued
me
from
that
and
we
bought
a
farm
with
our
combined
savings
we
became
real
farmers
up
with
the
sun
and
to
bed
with
the
same
andrew
wore
overalls
and
a
soft
shirt
and
grew
brown
and
tough
my
hands
got
red
and
blue
with
soapsuds
and
frost
i
never
saw
a
redfern
advertisement
from
one
year
end
to
another
and
my
kitchen
was
a
battlefield
where
i
set
my
teeth
and
learned
to
love
hard
work
our
literature
was
government
agriculture
reports
patent
medicine
almanacs
seedsmen
booklets
and
sears
roebuck
catalogues
we
subscribed
to
farm
and
fireside
and
read
the
serials
aloud
every
now
and
then
for
real
excitement
we
read
something
stirring
in
the
old
testament
that
cheery
book
jeremiah
for
instance
of
which
andrew
was
very
fond
the
farm
did
actually
prosper
after
a
while
and
andrew
used
to
hang
over
the
pasture
bars
at
sunset
and
tell
from
the
way
his
pipe
burned
just
what
the
weather
would
be
the
next
day
as
i
have
said
we
were
tremendously
happy
until
andrew
got
the
fatal
idea
of
telling
the
world
how
happy
we
were
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
admit
he
had
always
been
rather
a
bookish
man
in
his
college
days
he
had
edited
the
students
magazine
and
sometimes
he
would
get
discontented
with
the
farm
and
fireside
serials
and
pull
down
his
bound
volumes
of
the
college
paper
he
would
read
me
some
of
his
youthful
poems
and
stories
and
mutter
vaguely
about
writing
something
himself
some
day
i
was
more
concerned
with
sitting
hens
than
with
sonnets
and
i
bound
to
say
i
never
took
these
threats
very
seriously
i
should
have
been
more
severe
then
philip
died
and
his
carload
of
books
came
to
us
he
had
been
a
college
professor
and
years
ago
when
andrew
was
a
boy
uncle
philip
had
been
very
fond
of
him
had
in
fact
put
him
through
college
we
were
the
only
near
relatives
and
all
those
books
turned
up
one
fine
day
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
if
i
had
only
known
it
andrew
had
the
time
of
his
life
building
shelves
all
round
our
not
content
with
that
he
turned
the
old
hen
house
into
a
study
for
himself
put
in
a
stove
and
used
to
sit
up
there
evenings
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
the
first
thing
i
knew
he
called
the
place
sabine
farm
although
it
had
been
known
for
years
as
bog
hollow
because
he
thought
it
a
literary
thing
to
do
he
used
to
take
a
book
along
with
him
when
he
drove
over
to
redfield
for
supplies
sometimes
the
wagon
would
be
two
hours
late
coming
home
with
old
ben
loafing
along
between
the
shafts
and
andrew
lost
in
his
book
i
did
think
much
of
all
this
but
i
an
woman
and
as
long
as
andrew
kept
the
farm
going
i
had
plenty
to
do
on
my
own
hook
hot
bread
and
coffee
eggs
and
preserves
for
breakfast
soup
and
hot
meat
vegetables
dumplings
gravy
brown
bread
and
white
huckleberry
pudding
chocolate
cake
and
buttermilk
for
dinner
muffins
tea
sausage
rolls
blackberries
and
cream
and
doughnuts
for
supper
that
the
kind
of
menu
i
had
been
preparing
three
times
a
day
for
years
i
had
any
time
to
worry
about
what
was
my
business
and
then
one
morning
i
caught
andrew
doing
up
a
big
flat
parcel
for
the
postman
he
looked
so
sheepish
i
just
had
to
ask
what
it
was
i
written
a
book
said
andrew
and
he
showed
me
the
title
page
paradise
regained
by
andrew
mcgill
even
then
i
was
much
worried
because
of
course
i
knew
no
one
would
print
it
but
lord
a
month
or
so
later
came
a
letter
from
a
publisher
accepting
it
that
the
letter
andrew
keeps
framed
above
his
desk
just
to
show
how
such
things
sound
i
copy
it
here
decameron
jones
and
company
publishers
union
square
new
york
january
dear
mcgill
we
have
read
with
singular
pleasure
your
manuscript
paradise
regained
there
is
no
doubt
in
our
minds
that
so
spirited
an
account
of
the
joys
of
sane
country
living
should
meet
with
popular
approval
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
revisions
and
abbreviations
we
would
be
glad
to
publish
the
book
practically
as
it
stands
we
would
like
to
have
it
illustrated
by
tortoni
some
of
whose
work
you
may
have
seen
and
would
be
glad
to
know
whether
he
may
call
upon
you
in
order
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
local
colour
of
your
neighbourhood
we
would
be
glad
to
pay
you
a
royalty
of
percent
upon
the
retail
price
of
the
book
and
we
enclose
duplicate
contracts
for
your
signature
in
case
this
proves
satisfactory
to
you
believe
us
decameron
jones
co
i
have
since
thought
that
paradise
lost
would
have
been
a
better
title
for
that
book
it
was
published
in
the
autumn
of
and
since
that
time
our
life
has
never
been
the
same
by
some
mischance
the
book
became
the
success
of
the
season
it
was
widely
commended
as
a
gospel
of
health
and
sanity
and
andrew
received
in
almost
every
mail
offers
from
publishers
and
magazine
editors
who
wanted
to
get
hold
of
his
next
book
it
is
almost
incredible
to
what
stratagems
publishers
will
descend
to
influence
an
author
andrew
had
written
in
paradise
regained
of
the
tramps
who
visit
us
how
quaint
and
appealing
some
of
them
are
let
me
add
how
dirty
and
how
we
never
turn
away
any
one
who
seems
worthy
would
you
believe
that
in
the
spring
after
the
book
was
published
a
vagabond
with
a
knapsack
who
turned
up
one
day
blarneyed
andrew
about
his
book
and
stayed
overnight
announced
himself
at
breakfast
as
a
leading
new
york
publisher
he
had
chosen
this
ruse
in
order
to
make
andrew
acquaintance
you
can
imagine
that
it
did
take
long
for
andrew
to
become
spoiled
at
this
rate
the
next
year
he
suddenly
disappeared
leaving
only
a
note
on
the
kitchen
table
and
tramped
all
over
the
state
for
six
weeks
collecting
material
for
a
new
book
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
keep
him
from
going
to
new
york
to
talk
to
editors
and
people
of
that
sort
envelopes
of
newspaper
cuttings
used
to
come
to
him
and
he
would
pore
over
them
when
he
ought
to
have
been
ploughing
corn
luckily
the
mail
man
comes
along
about
the
middle
of
the
morning
when
andrew
is
out
in
the
fields
so
i
used
to
look
over
the
letters
before
he
saw
them
after
the
second
book
happiness
and
hayseed
it
was
called
was
printed
letters
from
publishers
got
so
thick
that
i
used
to
put
them
all
in
the
stove
before
andrew
saw
them
except
those
from
the
decameron
jones
people
which
sometimes
held
checks
literary
folk
used
to
turn
up
now
and
then
to
interview
andrew
but
generally
i
managed
to
head
them
off
but
andrew
got
to
be
less
and
less
of
a
farmer
and
more
and
more
of
a
literary
man
he
bought
a
typewriter
he
would
hang
over
the
pigpen
noting
down
adjectives
for
the
sunset
instead
of
mending
the
weather
vane
on
the
barn
which
took
a
slew
so
that
the
north
wind
came
from
the
southwest
he
hardly
ever
looked
at
the
sears
roebuck
catalogues
any
more
and
after
decameron
came
to
visit
us
and
suggested
that
andrew
write
a
book
of
country
poems
the
man
became
simply
unbearable
and
all
the
time
i
was
counting
eggs
and
turning
out
three
meals
a
day
and
running
the
farm
when
andrew
got
a
literary
fit
and
would
go
off
on
some
vagabond
jaunt
to
collect
adventures
for
a
new
book
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
state
he
was
in
when
he
came
back
from
these
trips
hoboing
it
along
the
roads
without
any
money
or
a
clean
sock
to
his
back
one
time
he
returned
with
a
cough
you
could
hear
the
other
side
of
the
barn
and
i
had
to
nurse
him
for
three
weeks
when
somebody
wrote
a
little
booklet
about
the
sage
of
redfield
and
described
me
as
a
rural
xantippe
and
the
domestic
that
kept
the
great
writer
close
to
the
homely
realities
of
life
i
made
up
my
mind
to
give
andrew
some
of
his
own
medicine
and
that
my
story
chapter
two
it
was
a
fine
crisp
morning
in
fall
october
i
dare
say
and
i
was
in
the
kitchen
coring
apples
for
apple
sauce
we
were
going
to
have
roast
pork
for
dinner
with
boiled
potatoes
and
what
andrew
calls
vandyke
brown
gravy
andrew
had
driven
over
to
town
to
get
some
flour
and
feed
and
would
be
back
till
noontime
being
a
monday
mcnally
the
washerwoman
had
come
over
to
take
care
of
the
washing
i
remember
i
was
just
on
my
way
out
to
the
wood
pile
for
a
few
sticks
of
birch
when
i
heard
wheels
turn
in
at
the
gate
there
was
one
of
the
fattest
white
horses
i
ever
saw
and
a
queer
wagon
shaped
like
a
van
a
little
man
with
a
red
beard
leaned
forward
from
the
seat
and
said
something
i
hear
what
it
was
i
was
looking
at
that
preposterous
wagon
of
his
it
was
coloured
a
pale
blue
and
on
the
side
in
big
scarlet
letters
was
painted
travelling
parnassus
good
books
for
sale
shakespeare
charles
lamb
hazlitt
and
all
others
underneath
the
wagon
in
slings
hung
what
looked
like
a
tent
together
with
a
lantern
a
bucket
and
other
small
things
the
van
had
a
raised
skylight
on
the
roof
something
like
an
trolley
car
and
from
one
corner
went
up
a
stove
pipe
at
the
back
was
a
door
with
little
windows
on
each
side
and
a
flight
of
steps
leading
up
to
it
as
i
stood
looking
at
this
queer
turnout
the
little
reddish
man
climbed
down
from
in
front
and
stood
watching
me
his
face
was
a
comic
mixture
of
pleasant
drollery
and
a
sort
of
cynicism
he
had
a
neat
little
russet
beard
and
a
shabby
norfolk
jacket
his
head
was
very
bald
is
this
where
andrew
mcgill
lives
he
said
i
admitted
it
but
he
away
until
noon
i
added
he
be
back
then
roast
pork
for
dinner
and
apple
sauce
said
the
little
man
apple
sauce
and
brown
gravy
i
said
that
why
i
sure
he
be
home
on
time
sometimes
he
late
when
there
boiled
dinner
but
never
on
roast
pork
days
andrew
would
never
do
for
a
rabbi
a
sudden
suspicion
struck
me
you
not
another
publisher
are
you
i
cried
what
do
you
want
with
andrew
i
was
wondering
whether
he
would
buy
this
outfit
said
the
little
man
including
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
both
van
and
white
horse
as
he
spoke
he
released
a
hook
somewhere
and
raised
the
whole
side
of
his
wagon
like
a
flap
some
kind
of
catch
clicked
the
flap
remained
up
like
a
roof
displaying
nothing
but
books
rows
and
rows
of
them
the
flank
of
his
van
was
nothing
but
a
big
bookcase
shelves
stood
above
shelves
all
of
them
full
of
books
both
old
and
new
as
i
stood
gazing
he
pulled
out
a
printed
card
from
somewhere
and
gave
it
to
me
roger
travelling
parnassus
worthy
friends
my
wain
doth
hold

celeryville
va
while
i
was
chuckling
over
this
he
had
raised
a
similar
flap
on
the
other
side
of
the
parnassus
which
revealed
still
more
shelves
loaded
with
books
i
afraid
i
am
severely
practical
by
nature
well
i
said
i
should
think
you
need
a
pretty
stout
steed
to
lug
that
load
along
it
must
weigh
more
than
a
coal
wagon
oh
peg
can
manage
it
all
right
he
said
we
do
travel
very
fast
but
look
here
i
want
to
sell

brother
not
my
husband
and
he
altogether
fond
of
books
books
be
the
ruin
of
this
farm
pretty
soon
he
mooning
about
over
his
books
like
a
sitting
hen
about
half
the
time
when
he
ought
to
be
mending
harness
lord
if
he
saw
this
wagonload
of
yours
he
be
unsettled
for
a
week
i
have
to
stop
the
postman
down
the
road
and
take
all
the
publishers
catalogues
out
of
the
mail
so
that
andrew
see
i
mighty
glad
he
not
here
just
now
i
can
tell
you
i
not
literary
as
i
said
before
but
i
human
enough
to
like
a
good
book
and
my
eye
was
running
along
those
shelves
of
his
as
i
spoke
he
certainly
had
a
pretty
miscellaneous
collection
i
noticed
poetry
essays
novels
cook
books
juveniles
school
books
bibles
and
what
not
all
jumbled
together
well
see
here
said
the
little
man
and
about
this
time
i
noticed
that
he
had
the
bright
eyes
of
a
fanatic
i
been
cruising
with
this
parnassus
going
on
seven
years
i
covered
the
territory
from
florida
to
maine
and
i
reckon
i
injected
about
as
much
good
literature
into
the
countryside
as
ever
old
doc
eliot
did
with
his
shelf
i
want
to
sell
out
now
i
going
to
write
a
book
about
among
the
farmers
and
want
to
settle
down
with
my
brother
in
brooklyn
and
write
it
i
got
a
sackful
of
notes
for
it
i
guess
i
just
stick
around
until
mcgill
gets
home
and
see
if
he
wo
buy
me
out
i
sell
the
whole
concern
horse
wagon
and
books
for
i
read
andrew
mcgill
stuff
and
i
reckon
the
proposition
interest
him
i
had
more
fun
with
this
parnassus
than
a
barrel
of
monkeys
i
used
to
be
a
school
teacher
till
my
health
broke
down
then
i
took
this
up
and
i
made
more
than
expenses
and
had
the
time
of
my
life
well
mifflin
i
said
if
you
want
to
stay
around
i
guess
i
ca
stop
you
but
i
sorry
you
and
your
old
parnassus
ever
came
this
way
i
turned
on
my
heel
and
went
back
to
the
kitchen
i
knew
pretty
well
that
andrew
would
go
up
in
the
air
when
he
saw
that
wagonload
of
books
and
one
of
those
crazy
cards
with
mifflin
poetry
on
it
i
must
confess
that
i
was
considerably
upset
andrew
is
just
as
unpractical
and
fanciful
as
a
young
girl
and
always
dreaming
of
new
adventures
and
rambles
around
the
country
if
he
ever
saw
that
travelling
parnassus
he
fall
for
it
like
snap
and
i
knew
decameron
was
after
him
for
a
new
book
anyway
i
intercepted
one
of
his
letters
suggesting
another
happiness
and
hayseed
trip
just
a
few
weeks
before
andrew
was
away
when
the
letter
came
i
had
a
suspicion
what
was
in
it
so
i
opened
it
read
it
and
well
burnt
it
heavens
as
though
andrew
did
have
enough
to
do
without
mooning
down
the
road
like
a
tinker
just
to
write
a
book
about
it
as
i
worked
around
the
kitchen
i
could
see
mifflin
making
himself
at
home
he
unhitched
his
horse
tied
her
up
to
the
fence
sat
down
by
the
wood
pile
and
lit
a
pipe
i
could
see
i
was
in
for
it
by
and
by
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
went
out
to
talk
to
that
pedlar
see
here
i
said
you
a
pretty
cool
fish
to
make
yourself
so
easy
in
my
yard
i
tell
you
i
do
want
you
around
here
you
and
your
travelling
parcheesi
suppose
you
clear
out
of
here
before
my
brother
gets
back
and
do
be
breaking
up
our
happy
family
miss
mcgill
he
said
the
man
had
a
pleasant
way
with
him
too
darn
him
with
his
bright
twinkling
eye
and
his
silly
little
beard
i
sure
i
do
want
to
be
discourteous
if
you
move
me
on
from
here
of
course
i
go
but
i
warn
you
i
shall
lie
in
wait
for
mcgill
just
down
this
road
i
here
to
sell
this
caravan
of
culture
and
by
the
bones
of
swinburne
i
think
your
brother
the
man
to
buy
it
my
blood
was
up
now
and
i
admit
that
i
said
my
next
without
proper
calculation
rather
than
have
andrew
buy
your
old
parcheesi
i
said
i
buy
it
myself
i
give
you
for
it
the
little
man
face
brightened
he
did
either
accept
or
decline
my
offer
i
was
frightened
to
death
that
he
take
me
right
on
the
nail
and
bang
would
go
my
three
years
savings
for
a
ford
come
and
have
another
look
at
her
he
said
i
must
admit
that
roger
mifflin
had
fixed
up
his
van
mighty
comfortably
inside
the
body
of
the
wagon
was
built
out
on
each
side
over
the
wheels
which
gave
it
an
unwieldy
appearance
but
made
extra
room
for
the
bookshelves
this
left
an
inside
space
about
five
feet
wide
and
nine
long
on
one
side
he
had
a
little
oil
stove
a
flap
table
and
a
bunk
above
which
was
built
a
kind
of
chest
of
drawers
to
hold
clothes
and
such
things
i
suppose
on
the
other
side
more
bookshelves
a
small
table
and
a
little
wicker
easy
chair
every
possible
inch
of
space
seemed
to
be
made
useful
in
some
way
for
a
shelf
or
a
hook
or
a
hanging
cupboard
or
something
above
the
stove
was
a
neat
little
row
of
pots
and
dishes
and
cooking
usefuls
the
raised
skylight
made
it
just
possible
to
stand
upright
in
the
centre
aisle
of
the
van
and
a
little
sliding
window
opened
onto
the
driver
seat
in
front
altogether
it
was
a
very
neat
affair
the
windows
in
front
and
back
were
curtained
and
a
pot
of
geraniums
stood
on
a
diminutive
shelf
i
was
amused
to
see
a
sandy
irish
terrier
curled
up
on
a
bright
mexican
blanket
in
the
bunk
miss
mcgill
he
said
i
could
sell
parnassus
for
less
than
four
hundred
i
put
twice
that
much
into
her
one
time
and
another
she
built
clean
and
solid
all
through
and
everything
a
man
would
need
from
blankets
to
bouillon
cubes
the
whole
thing
yours
for
including
dog
cook
stove
and
everything
jib
boom
and
spanker
there
a
tent
in
a
sling
underneath
and
an
ice
box
he
pulled
up
a
little
trap
door
under
the
bunk
and
a
tank
of
coal
oil
and
lord
knows
what
all
she
as
good
as
a
yacht
but
i
tired
of
her
if
you
so
afraid
of
your
brother
taking
a
fancy
to
her
why
do
you
buy
her
yourself
and
go
off
on
a
lark
make
stay
home
and
mind
the
farm
tell
you
what
i
do
i
start
you
on
the
road
myself
come
with
you
the
first
day
and
show
you
how
it
worked
you
could
have
the
time
of
your
life
in
this
thing
and
give
yourself
a
fine
vacation
it
would
give
your
brother
a
good
surprise
too
why
not
i
do
know
whether
it
was
the
neatness
of
his
absurd
little
van
or
the
madness
of
the
whole
proposition
or
just
the
desire
to
have
an
adventure
of
my
own
and
play
a
trick
on
andrew
but
anyway
some
extraordinary
impulse
seized
me
and
i
roared
with
laughter
right
i
said
i
do
it
i
helen
mcgill
in
the
year
of
my
age
chapter
three
well
i
thought
if
i
in
for
an
adventure
i
may
as
well
be
spry
about
it
andrew
be
home
by
twelve
and
if
i
going
to
give
him
the
slip
i
better
get
a
start
i
suppose
he
think
crazy
he
follow
me
i
guess
well
he
just
sha
catch
me
that
all
a
kind
of
anger
came
over
me
to
think
that
i
been
living
on
that
farm
for
nearly
fifteen
years
yes
sir
ever
since
i
was
and
hardly
ever
been
away
except
for
that
trip
to
boston
once
a
year
to
go
shopping
with
cousin
edie
i
a
soul
i
guess
and
i
love
my
kitchen
and
my
preserve
cupboard
and
my
linen
closet
as
well
as
grandmother
ever
did
but
something
in
that
blue
october
air
and
that
crazy
little
man
just
tickled
me
look
here
parnassus
i
said
i
guess
i
a
fat
old
fool
but
i
just
believe
i
do
that
you
hitch
up
your
horse
and
van
and
i
go
pack
some
clothes
and
write
you
a
check
it
do
andrew
all
the
good
in
the
world
to
have
me
skip
i
get
a
chance
to
read
a
few
books
too
it
be
as
good
as
going
to
college
and
i
untied
my
apron
and
ran
for
the
house
the
little
man
stood
leaning
against
a
corner
of
the
van
as
if
he
were
stupefied
i
dare
say
he
was
i
ran
into
the
house
through
the
front
door
and
it
struck
me
as
comical
to
see
a
copy
of
one
of
andrew
magazines
lying
on
the
table
with
the
revolt
of
womanhood
printed
across
it
in
red
letters
here
goes
for
the
revolt
of
helen
mcgill
i
thought
i
sat
down
at
andrew
desk
pushed
aside
a
pad
of
notes
he
had
been
jotting
down
about
the
magic
of
autumn
and
scrawled
a
few
lines
dear
andrew
do
be
thinking
i
crazy
i
gone
off
for
an
adventure
it
just
came
over
me
that
you
had
all
the
adventures
while
i
been
at
home
baking
bread
mcnally
will
look
after
your
meals
and
one
of
her
girls
can
come
over
to
do
the
housework
so
do
worry
going
off
for
a
little
while
a
month
maybe
to
see
some
of
this
happiness
and
hayseed
of
yours
it
what
the
magazines
call
the
revolt
of
womanhood
warm
underwear
in
the
cedar
chest
in
the
spare
room
when
you
need
it
with
love
helen
i
left
the
note
on
his
desk
mcnally
was
bending
over
the
tubs
in
the
laundry
i
could
see
only
the
broad
arch
of
her
back
and
hear
the
vigorous
zzzzzzz
of
her
rubbing
she
straightened
up
at
my
call
mcnally
i
said
i
going
away
for
a
little
trip
better
let
the
washing
go
until
this
afternoon
and
get
dinner
for
him
he
be
back
about
it
ten
now
you
tell
him
i
gone
over
to
see
collins
at
locust
farm
mcnally
is
a
brawny
swede
all
right
mcgill
she
said
you
be
back
to
denner
no
i
not
coming
back
for
a
month
i
said
i
going
away
for
a
trip
i
want
you
to
send
rosie
over
here
every
day
to
do
the
housework
while
i
away
you
can
arrange
with
mcgill
about
that
i
got
to
hurry
now
mcnally
honest
eyes
as
blue
as
copenhagen
china
gazing
through
the
window
in
perplexity
fell
upon
the
travelling
parnassus
and
mifflin
backing
pegasus
into
the
shafts
i
saw
her
make
a
valiant
effort
to
comprehend
the
sign
painted
on
the
side
of
the
van
and
give
it
up
you
going
driving
she
said
blankly
yes
i
said
and
fled
upstairs
i
always
keep
my
bank
book
in
an
old
huyler
box
in
the
top
drawer
of
my
bureau
i
do
save
very
quickly
i
afraid
i
have
a
little
income
from
some
money
father
left
me
but
andrew
takes
care
of
that
andrew
pays
all
the
farm
expenses
but
the
housekeeping
accounts
fall
to
me
i
make
a
fairish
amount
of
pin
money
on
my
poultry
and
some
of
my
preserves
that
i
send
to
boston
and
on
some
recipes
of
mine
that
i
send
to
a
woman
magazine
now
and
then
but
generally
my
savings
do
amount
to
much
over
a
month
in
the
last
five
years
i
had
put
by
something
more
than
i
had
been
saving
up
for
a
ford
but
just
now
it
looked
to
me
as
if
that
parnassus
would
be
more
fun
than
a
ford
ever
could
be
four
hundred
dollars
was
a
lot
of
money
but
i
thought
of
what
it
would
mean
to
have
andrew
come
home
and
buy
it
why
he
be
away
until
thanksgiving
whereas
if
i
bought
it
i
could
take
it
away
have
my
adventure
and
sell
it
somewhere
so
that
andrew
never
need
see
it
i
hardened
my
heart
and
determined
to
give
the
sage
of
redfield
some
of
his
own
medicine
my
balance
at
the
redfield
national
bank
was
i
sat
down
at
the
table
in
my
bedroom
where
i
keep
my
accounts
and
wrote
out
a
check
to
roger
mifflin
for
i
put
in
plenty
of
curlicues
after
the
figures
so
that
no
one
could
raise
the
check
into
then
i
got
out
my
old
rattan
suit
case
and
put
in
some
clothes
the
whole
business
did
take
me
ten
minutes
i
came
downstairs
to
find
mcnally
looking
sourly
at
the
parnassus
from
the
kitchen
door
you
going
away
in
that
that
mis
mcgill
she
asked
yes
mcnally
i
said
cheerfully
her
use
of
the
word
gave
me
an
inspiration
that
one
of
the
new
jitney
we
hear
about
he
going
to
take
me
to
the
station
do
you
worry
about
me
going
for
a
holiday
you
get
mcgill
dinner
ready
for
him
after
dinner
tell
him
there
a
note
for
him
in
the
i
tank
that
bane
a
queer
said
mcnally
puzzled
i
think
the
excellent
woman
suspected
an
elopement
i
carried
my
suit
case
out
to
the
parnassus
pegasus
stood
placidly
between
the
shafts
from
within
came
sounds
of
vigorous
movement
in
a
moment
the
little
man
burst
out
with
a
bulging
portmanteau
in
his
hand
he
had
a
tweed
cap
slanted
on
the
back
of
his
head
there
he
cried
triumphantly
i
packed
all
my
personal
effects
clothes
and
so
on
and
everything
else
goes
with
the
transaction
when
i
get
on
the
train
with
this
bag
i
a
free
man
and
hurrah
for
brooklyn
lord
wo
i
be
glad
to
get
back
to
the
city
i
lived
in
brooklyn
once
and
i
have
been
back
there
for
ten
years
he
added
plaintively
here
the
check
i
said
handing
it
to
him
he
flushed
a
little
and
looked
at
me
rather
shamefacedly
see
here
he
said
i
hope
you
not
making
a
bad
bargain
i
do
want
to
take
advantage
of
a
lady
if
you
think
your
brother
i
was
going
to
buy
a
ford
anyway
i
said
and
it
looks
to
me
as
though
this
parcheesi
of
yours
would
be
cheaper
to
run
than
any
flivver
that
ever
came
out
of
detroit
i
want
to
keep
it
away
from
andrew
and
that
the
main
thing
you
give
me
a
receipt
and
get
away
from
here
before
he
comes
back
he
took
the
check
without
a
word
hoisted
his
fat
portmanteau
on
the
driver
seat
and
then
disappeared
in
the
van
in
a
minute
he
reappeared
on
the
back
of
one
of
his
poetical
cards
he
had
written
received
from
miss
mcgill
the
sum
of
four
hundred
dollars
in
exchange
for
one
travelling
parnassus
in
first
class
condition
delivered
to
her
this
day
october
signed
roger
mifflin
tell
me
i
said
does
your
parnassus
parnassus
rather
contain
everything
i
likely
to
need
is
it
stocked
up
with
food
and
so
on
i
was
coming
to
that
he
said
you
find
a
fair
supply
of
stuff
in
the
cupboard
over
the
stove
though
i
used
to
get
most
of
my
meals
at
farmhouses
along
the
road
i
generally
read
aloud
to
people
as
i
go
along
and
they
often
good
for
a
free
meal
it
amazing
how
little
most
of
the
country
folk
know
about
books
and
how
pleased
they
are
to
hear
good
stuff
down
in
lancaster
county
pennsylvania
well
how
about
the
horse
i
said
hastily
seeing
him
about
to
embark
on
an
anecdote
it
was
far
short
of
eleven
and
i
was
anxious
to
get
started
it
might
be
well
to
take
along
some
oats
my
supply
about
exhausted
i
filled
a
sack
with
oats
in
the
stable
and
mifflin
showed
me
where
to
hang
it
under
the
van
then
in
the
kitchen
i
loaded
a
big
basket
with
provisions
for
an
emergency
a
dozen
eggs
a
jar
of
sliced
bacon
butter
cheese
condensed
milk
tea
biscuits
jam
and
two
loaves
of
bread
these
mifflin
stowed
inside
the
van
mcnally
watching
in
amazement
i
tank
this
bane
a
queer
picnic
she
said
which
way
are
you
going
mcgill
is
he
coming
after
you
no
i
insisted
he
not
coming
i
going
off
on
a
holiday
you
get
dinner
for
him
and
he
wo
worry
about
anything
until
after
that
tell
him
i
gone
over
to
see
mrs
collins
i
climbed
the
little
steps
and
entered
my
parnassus
with
a
pleasant
thrill
of
ownership
the
terrier
on
the
bunk
jumped
to
the
floor
with
a
friendly
wag
of
the
tail
i
piled
the
bunk
with
bedding
and
blankets
of
my
own
shook
out
the
drawers
which
fitted
above
the
bunk
and
put
into
them
what
few
belongings
i
was
taking
with
me
and
we
were
ready
to
start
redbeard
was
already
sitting
in
front
with
the
reins
in
hand
i
climbed
up
beside
him
the
front
seat
was
broad
but
uncushioned
well
sheltered
by
the
peak
of
the
van
i
gave
a
quick
glance
around
at
the
comfortable
house
under
its
elms
and
maples
saw
the
big
red
barn
shining
in
the
sun
and
the
pump
under
the
grape
arbour
i
waved
to
mcnally
who
was
watching
us
in
silent
amazement
pegasus
threw
her
solid
weight
against
the
traces
and
parnassus
swung
round
and
rolled
past
the
gate
we
turned
into
the
redfield
road
here
said
mifflin
handing
me
the
reins
you
skipper
better
drive
which
way
do
you
want
to
go
my
breath
came
a
little
fast
when
i
realized
that
my
adventure
had
begun
chapter
four
just
out
of
sight
of
the
farm
the
road
forks
one
way
running
on
to
walton
where
you
cross
the
river
by
a
covered
bridge
the
other
swinging
down
toward
greenbriar
and
port
vigor
collins
lives
a
mile
or
so
up
the
walton
road
and
as
i
very
often
run
over
to
see
her
i
thought
andrew
would
be
most
likely
to
look
for
me
there
so
after
we
had
passed
through
the
grove
i
took
the
turn
to
greenbriar
we
began
the
long
ascent
over
huckleberry
hill
and
as
i
smelt
the
fresh
autumn
odour
of
the
leaves
i
chuckled
a
little
mifflin
seemed
in
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
high
spirits
this
is
certainly
grand
he
said
lord
i
applaud
your
spunk
do
you
think
mcgill
will
give
chase
i
have
an
idea
i
said
not
right
away
anyhow
he
so
used
to
my
settled
ways
that
i
do
think
he
suspect
anything
till
he
finds
my
note
i
wonder
what
kind
of
story
mcnally
will
tell
how
about
putting
him
off
the
scent
he
said
give
me
your
handkerchief
i
did
so
he
hopped
nimbly
out
ran
back
down
the
hill
he
was
a
spry
little
person
in
spite
of
his
bald
crown
and
dropped
the
handkerchief
on
the
walton
road
about
a
hundred
feet
beyond
the
fork
then
he
followed
me
up
the
slope
there
he
said
grinning
like
a
kid
that
fool
him
the
sage
of
redfield
will
undoubtedly
follow
a
false
spoor
and
the
criminals
will
win
a
good
start
but
i
afraid
it
rather
easy
to
follow
a
craft
as
unusual
as
parnassus
tell
me
how
you
manage
the
thing
i
said
do
you
really
make
it
pay
we
halted
at
the
top
of
the
hill
to
give
pegasus
a
breathing
space
the
terrier
lay
down
in
the
dust
and
watched
us
gravely
mifflin
pulled
out
a
pipe
and
begged
my
permission
to
smoke
it
rather
comical
how
i
first
got
into
it
he
said
i
was
a
school
teacher
down
in
maryland
i
been
plugging
away
in
a
country
school
for
years
on
a
starvation
salary
i
was
trying
to
support
an
invalid
mother
and
put
by
something
in
case
of
storms
i
remember
how
i
used
to
wonder
whether
i
ever
be
able
to
wear
a
suit
that
was
shabby
and
have
my
shoes
polished
every
day
then
my
health
went
back
on
me
the
doctor
told
me
to
get
into
the
open
air
by
and
by
i
got
this
idea
of
a
travelling
bookstore
i
had
always
been
a
lover
of
books
and
in
the
days
when
i
boarded
out
among
the
farmers
i
used
to
read
aloud
to
them
after
my
mother
died
i
built
the
wagon
to
suit
my
own
ideas
bought
a
stock
of
books
from
a
big
store
in
baltimore
and
set
out
parnassus
just
about
saved
my
life
i
guess
he
pushed
his
faded
old
cap
back
on
his
head
and
relit
his
pipe
i
clicked
to
pegasus
and
we
rumbled
gently
off
over
the
upland
looking
down
across
the
pastures
distant
cow
bells
sounded
among
the
bushes
across
the
slope
of
the
hill
i
could
see
the
road
winding
away
to
redfield
somewhere
along
that
road
andrew
would
be
rolling
back
toward
home
and
roast
pork
with
apple
sauce
and
here
was
i
setting
out
on
the
first
madness
of
my
life
without
even
a
qualm
miss
mcgill
said
the
little
man
this
rolling
pavilion
has
been
wife
doctor
and
religion
to
me
for
seven
years
a
month
ago
i
would
have
scoffed
at
the
thought
of
leaving
her
but
somehow
come
over
me
i
need
a
change
there
a
book
i
been
yearning
to
write
for
a
long
time
and
i
need
a
desk
steady
under
my
elbows
and
a
roof
over
my
head
and
silly
as
it
seems
i
crazy
to
get
back
to
brooklyn
my
brother
and
i
used
to
live
there
as
kids
think
of
walking
over
the
old
bridge
at
sunset
and
seeing
the
towers
of
manhattan
against
a
red
sky
and
those
old
gray
cruisers
down
in
the
navy
yard
you
do
know
how
tickled
i
am
to
sell
out
i
sold
a
lot
of
copies
of
your
brother
books
and
i
often
thought
he
be
the
man
to
buy
parnassus
if
i
got
tired
of
her
so
he
would
i
said
just
the
man
he
be
only
too
likely
to
and
go
maundering
about
in
this
jaunting
car
and
neglect
the
farm
but
tell
me
about
selling
books
how
much
profit
do
you
make
out
of
it
we
be
passing
mason
farm
by
and
by
and
we
might
as
well
sell
her
something
just
to
make
a
start
it
very
simple
he
said
i
replenish
my
stock
whenever
i
go
through
a
big
town
there
always
a
bookstore
somewhere
about
where
you
can
pick
up
odds
and
ends
and
every
now
and
then
i
write
to
a
wholesaler
in
new
york
for
some
stuff
when
i
buy
a
book
i
mark
in
the
back
just
what
i
paid
for
it
then
i
know
what
i
can
afford
to
sell
it
for
see
here
he
pulled
up
a
book
from
behind
the
seat
a
copy
of
lorna
doone
it
was
and
showed
me
the
letters
scrawled
in
pencil
in
the
back
that
means
that
i
paid
ten
cents
for
this
now
if
you
sell
it
for
a
quarter
you
got
a
safe
profit
it
costs
me
about
four
dollars
a
week
to
run
parnassus
generally
less
if
you
clear
that
much
in
six
days
you
can
afford
to
lay
off
on
sundays
how
do
you
know
that
stands
for
ten
cents
i
asked
the
code
word
each
letter
stands
for
a
figure
from
up
to
see
he
scrawled
it
down
on
a
scrap
of
paper
m
a
n
u
s
c
r
i
p
t
now
you
see
stands
for
would
be
is
is
m
is
and
so
on
i
do
pay
much
over
fifty
cents
for
books
as
a
rule
because
country
folks
are
shy
of
paying
much
for
them
they
pay
a
lot
for
a
separator
or
a
buggy
top
but
they
never
been
taught
to
worry
about
literature
but
it
surprising
how
excited
they
get
about
books
if
you
sell
the
right
kind
over
beyond
port
vigor
there
a
farmer
who
waiting
for
me
to
go
back
i
been
there
three
or
four
times
and
buy
about
five
dollars
worth
if
i
know
him
first
time
i
went
there
i
sold
him
island
and
he
talking
about
it
yet
i
sold
him
crusoe
and
women
for
his
daughter
and
finn
and
grubb
book
about
potato
last
time
i
was
there
he
wanted
some
shakespeare
but
i
would
give
it
to
him
i
did
think
he
was
up
to
it
yet
i
began
to
see
something
of
the
little
man
idealism
in
his
work
he
was
a
kind
of
traveling
missionary
in
his
way
a
hefty
talker
too
his
eyes
were
twinkling
now
and
i
could
see
him
warming
up
lord
he
said
when
you
sell
a
man
a
book
you
do
sell
him
just
twelve
ounces
of
paper
and
ink
and
glue
you
sell
him
a
whole
new
life
love
and
friendship
and
humour
and
ships
at
sea
by
night
there
all
heaven
and
earth
in
a
book
a
real
book
i
mean
jiminy
if
i
were
the
baker
or
the
butcher
or
the
broom
huckster
people
would
run
to
the
gate
when
i
came
by
just
waiting
for
my
stuff
and
here
i
go
loaded
with
everlasting
salvation
yes
salvation
for
their
little
stunted
minds
and
it
hard
to
make
see
it
that
what
makes
it
worth
while
i
doing
something
that
nobody
else
from
nazareth
maine
to
walla
walla
washington
has
ever
thought
of
it
a
new
field
but
by
the
bones
of
whitman
worth
while
that
what
this
country
needs
more
books
he
laughed
at
his
own
vehemence
do
you
know
it
comical
he
said
even
the
publishers
the
fellows
that
print
the
books
ca
see
what
i
doing
for
them
some
of
refuse
me
credit
because
i
sell
their
books
for
what
they
worth
instead
of
for
the
prices
they
mark
on
them
they
write
me
letters
about
and
i
write
back
about
publish
a
good
book
and
i
get
a
good
price
for
it
say
i
sometimes
i
think
the
publishers
know
less
about
books
than
any
one
else
i
guess
that
natural
though
most
school
teachers
do
know
much
about
children
the
best
of
it
is
he
went
on
i
have
such
a
darn
good
time
peg
and
bock
that
the
dog
and
i
go
loafing
along
the
road
on
a
warm
summer
day
and
by
and
by
we
fetch
up
alongside
some
and
there
are
the
boarders
all
rocking
off
their
lunch
on
the
veranda
most
of
bored
to
death
nothing
good
to
read
nothing
to
do
but
sit
and
watch
the
flies
buzzing
in
the
sun
and
the
chickens
rubbing
up
and
down
in
the
dust
first
thing
you
know
i
sell
half
a
dozen
books
that
put
the
love
of
life
into
them
and
they
do
forget
parnassus
in
a
hurry
take
henry
for
instance
there
is
anybody
so
sleepy
that
he
wo
enjoy
that
man
stories
he
understood
life
you
bet
and
he
could
write
it
down
with
all
its
little
twists
i
spent
an
evening
reading
henry
and
wilkie
collins
to
people
and
had
them
buy
out
all
their
books
i
had
and
clamour
for
more
what
do
you
do
in
winter
i
asked
a
practical
question
as
most
of
mine
are
that
depends
on
where
i
am
when
bad
weather
sets
in
said
mifflin
two
winters
i
was
down
south
and
managed
to
keep
parnassus
going
all
through
the
season
otherwise
i
just
lay
up
wherever
i
am
i
never
found
it
hard
to
get
lodging
for
peg
and
a
job
for
myself
if
i
had
to
have
them
last
winter
i
worked
in
a
bookstore
in
boston
winter
before
i
was
in
a
country
drugstore
down
in
pennsylvania
winter
before
that
i
tutored
a
couple
of
small
boys
in
english
literature
winter
before
that
i
was
a
steward
on
a
steamer
you
see
how
it
goes
i
had
a
fairly
miscellaneous
experience
as
far
as
i
can
see
a
man
who
fond
of
books
never
need
starve
but
this
winter
i
planning
to
live
with
my
brother
in
brooklyn
and
slog
away
at
my
book
lord
how
i
pondered
over
that
thing
long
summer
afternoons
i
sat
here
jogging
along
in
the
dust
thinking
it
out
until
it
seemed
as
if
my
forehead
would
burst
you
see
my
idea
is
that
the
common
people
in
the
country
that
is
never
have
had
any
chance
to
get
hold
of
books
and
never
have
had
any
one
to
explain
what
books
can
mean
it
all
right
for
college
presidents
to
draw
up
their
shelves
of
great
literature
and
for
the
publishers
to
advertise
sets
of
their
linoleum
classics
but
what
the
people
need
is
the
good
homely
honest
stuff
something
that
stick
to
their
ribs
make
them
laugh
and
tremble
and
feel
sick
to
think
of
the
littleness
of
this
popcorn
ball
spinning
in
space
without
ever
even
getting
a
and
something
that
spur
on
to
keep
the
hearth
well
swept
and
the
wood
pile
split
into
kindling
and
the
dishes
washed
and
dried
and
put
away
any
one
who
can
get
the
country
people
to
read
something
worth
while
is
doing
his
nation
a
real
service
and
that
what
this
caravan
of
culture
aspires
to
you
must
be
weary
of
this
harangue
does
the
sage
of
redfield
ever
run
on
like
that
not
to
me
i
said
he
known
me
so
long
that
he
thinks
of
me
as
a
kind
of
animated
and
machine
i
guess
he
does
put
much
stock
in
my
judgment
in
literary
matters
but
he
puts
his
digestion
in
my
hands
without
reserve
there
farm
over
there
i
guess
we
better
sell
them
some
books
we
just
for
a
starter
we
turned
into
the
lane
that
runs
up
to
the
mason
farmhouse
bock
trotted
on
ahead
very
stiff
on
his
legs
and
his
tail
gently
wagging
to
interview
the
mastiff
and
mason
who
was
sitting
on
the
porch
peeling
potatoes
laid
down
the
pan
she
a
big
buxom
woman
with
jolly
brown
eyes
like
a
cow
for
heaven
sake
miss
mcgill
she
called
out
in
a
cheerful
voice
i
glad
to
see
you
got
a
lift
did
you
she
had
really
noticed
the
inscription
on
parnassus
and
thought
it
was
a
regular
huckster
wagon
well
mason
i
said
i
gone
into
the
book
business
this
is
mifflin
i
bought
out
his
stock
we
come
to
sell
you
some
books
she
laughed
go
on
helen
she
said
you
ca
kid
me
i
bought
a
whole
set
of
books
last
year
from
an
agent
world
great
funeral
orations
twenty
volumes
sam
and
i
ai
read
the
first
volume
yet
it
awful
uneasy
reading
mifflin
jumped
down
and
raised
the
side
flap
of
the
wagon
mason
came
closer
i
was
tickled
to
see
how
the
little
man
perked
up
at
the
sight
of
a
customer
evidently
selling
books
was
meat
and
drink
to
him
madam
he
said
orations
bound
in
sackcloth
i
suppose
have
their
place
but
miss
mcgill
and
i
have
got
some
real
books
here
to
which
i
invite
your
attention
winter
will
be
here
soon
and
you
will
need
something
more
cheerful
to
beguile
your
evenings
very
possibly
you
have
growing
children
who
would
profit
by
a
good
book
or
two
a
book
of
fairy
tales
for
the
little
girl
i
see
on
the
porch
or
stories
of
inventors
for
that
boy
who
is
about
to
break
his
neck
jumping
from
the
barn
loft
or
a
book
about
road
making
for
your
husband
surely
there
is
something
here
you
need
miss
mcgill
probably
knows
your
tastes
that
little
man
was
surely
a
born
salesman
how
he
guessed
that
mason
was
the
road
commissioner
in
our
township
goodness
only
knows
perhaps
it
was
just
a
lucky
shot
by
this
time
most
of
the
family
had
gathered
around
the
van
and
i
saw
mason
coming
from
the
barn
with
his
billy
sam
shouted
mason
here
miss
mcgill
turned
book
pedlar
and
got
a
preacher
with
her
hello
miss
mcgill
said
mason
he
is
a
big
man
of
great
gravity
and
solidity
where
andrew
andrew
coming
home
for
roast
pork
and
apple
sauce
i
said
and
i
going
off
to
sell
books
for
a
living
mifflin
here
is
teaching
me
how
we
got
a
book
on
road
mending
that
just
what
you
need
i
saw
and
mason
exchange
glances
evidently
they
thought
me
crazy
i
began
to
wonder
whether
we
had
made
a
mistake
in
calling
on
people
i
knew
so
well
the
situation
was
a
trifle
embarrassing
mifflin
came
to
the
rescue
do
be
alarmed
sir
he
said
to
mason
i
have
kidnapped
miss
mcgill
as
he
is
about
half
my
size
this
was
amusing
we
are
trying
to
increase
her
brother
income
by
selling
his
books
for
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
a
wager
with
him
that
we
can
sell
fifty
copies
of
and
hayseed
before
now
sure
your
sporting
instinct
will
assist
us
by
taking
at
least
one
copy
andrew
mcgill
is
probably
the
greatest
author
in
this
state
and
every
taxpayer
ought
to
possess
his
books
may
i
show
you
a
copy
that
sounds
reasonable
said
mason
and
he
almost
smiled
what
do
you
say
emma
think
we
better
buy
a
book
or
two
you
know
those
well
said
emma
you
know
always
said
we
ought
to
read
one
of
andrew
mcgill
books
but
we
did
rightly
know
how
to
get
hold
of
one
that
fellow
that
sold
us
the
funeral
speeches
did
seem
to
know
about
i
tell
you
what
you
folks
better
stop
and
have
dinner
with
us
and
you
can
tell
us
what
we
ought
to
buy
i
just
ready
to
put
the
potatoes
on
the
stove
now
i
must
confess
that
the
prospect
of
sitting
down
to
a
meal
i
cooked
myself
appealed
to
me
strongly
and
i
was
keen
to
see
what
kind
of
grub
mason
provided
for
her
household
but
i
was
afraid
that
if
we
dallied
there
too
long
andrew
would
be
after
us
i
was
about
to
say
that
we
would
have
to
be
getting
on
and
stay
but
apparently
the
zest
of
expounding
his
philosophy
to
new
listeners
was
too
much
for
mifflin
i
heard
him
saying
that
mighty
kind
of
you
mason
and
we
like
very
much
to
stay
perhaps
i
can
put
peg
up
in
your
barn
for
a
while
then
we
can
tell
you
all
about
our
books
and
to
my
amazement
i
found
myself
chiming
in
with
assent
mifflin
certainly
surpassed
himself
at
dinner
the
fact
that
mason
hot
biscuits
tasted
of
saleratus
gave
me
far
less
satisfaction
than
it
otherwise
would
because
i
was
absorbed
in
listening
to
the
little
vagabond
talk
mason
came
to
the
table
grumbling
something
about
his
telephone
being
out
of
order
i
wondered
whether
he
had
been
trying
to
get
andrew
on
the
wire
he
was
a
little
afraid
that
i
was
being
run
away
with
i
think
but
he
was
soon
won
over
by
the
current
of
the
little
man
cheery
wit
nothing
daunted
mifflin
he
talked
to
the
old
grandmother
about
quilts
offered
to
cut
off
a
strip
of
his
necktie
for
her
new
patchwork
and
told
all
about
the
illustrated
book
on
quilts
that
he
had
in
the
van
he
discussed
cookery
and
the
bible
with
mason
and
she
being
a
leading
light
in
the
greenbriar
sunday
school
was
pleasantly
scandalized
by
his
account
of
the
best
detective
stories
in
the
old
testament
with
mason
he
was
all
scientific
farming
chemical
manures
macadam
roads
and
crop
rotation
and
to
little
billy
who
sat
next
him
he
told
extraordinary
yarns
about
daniel
boone
davy
crockett
kit
carson
buffalo
bill
and
what
not
honestly
i
was
amazed
at
the
little
man
he
was
as
genial
as
a
cricket
on
the
hearth
and
yet
every
now
and
then
his
earnestness
would
break
through
i
do
wonder
he
was
a
success
at
selling
books
that
man
could
sell
clothes
pins
or
paris
garters
i
guess
and
make
them
seem
romantic
you
know
mason
he
said
you
certainly
owe
it
to
these
youngsters
of
yours
to
put
a
few
really
good
books
into
their
hands
city
kids
have
the
libraries
to
go
to
but
in
the
country
only
old
doc
hostetter
almanac
and
the
letters
written
by
ladies
with
backache
telling
how
peruna
did
for
them
give
this
boy
and
girl
of
yours
a
few
good
books
and
you
starting
them
on
the
line
to
happiness
now
there
women
that
girl
of
yours
can
learn
more
about
real
girlhood
and
fine
womanhood
out
of
that
book
than
from
a
year
paper
dolls
in
the
attic
that
right
pa
assented
mason
go
on
with
your
meal
professor
the
meat
be
cold
she
was
completely
won
by
the
travelling
bookseller
and
had
given
him
the
highest
title
of
honour
in
her
ken
why
i
read
that
story
when
i
was
a
girl
and
i
still
remember
it
that
better
readin
for
dorothy
than
those
funeral
speeches
i
reckon
i
believe
the
professor
right
we
ought
to
have
more
books
laying
around
seems
kind
of
a
shame
with
a
famous
author
at
the
next
farm
not
to
read
more
do
it
now
so
by
the
time
we
got
down
to
mason
squash
pie
good
pie
too
i
admit
but
her
hand
is
a
little
heavy
for
pastry
the
whole
household
was
enthusiastic
about
books
and
the
atmosphere
was
literary
enough
for
even
eliot
to
live
in
without
panting
mason
opened
up
her
parlour
and
we
sat
there
while
mifflin
recited
the
revenge
and
maud
muller
well
now
ai
that
real
sweet
said
emma
mason
surprising
how
those
words
rhyme
so
nicely
seems
almost
as
though
it
was
done
reminds
me
of
piece
day
at
school
there
was
a
mighty
pretty
piece
i
learned
called
the
of
the
asperus
and
she
subsided
into
a
genteel
melancholy
i
saw
that
mifflin
was
well
astride
his
hobby
he
had
started
to
tell
the
children
about
robin
hood
but
i
had
the
sense
to
give
him
a
wink
we
had
to
be
getting
along
or
surely
andrew
might
be
on
us
so
while
mifflin
was
putting
pegasus
into
the
shafts
again
i
picked
out
seven
or
eight
books
that
i
thought
would
fit
the
needs
of
the
masons
mason
insisted
that
happiness
and
hayseed
be
included
among
them
and
gave
me
a
crisp
bill
refusing
any
change
no
no
he
said
i
had
more
fun
than
i
get
at
a
grange
meeting
come
round
again
miss
mcgill
i
going
to
tell
andrew
what
a
good
show
this
travelling
theayter
of
yours
gives
and
you
professor
any
time
you
here
about
season
stop
in
an
tell
me
some
more
good
advice
well
i
must
get
back
to
the
field
bock
fell
in
under
the
van
and
we
creaked
off
down
the
lane
mifflin
filled
his
pipe
and
was
chuckling
to
himself
i
was
a
little
worried
now
for
fear
andrew
might
overtake
us
it
a
wonder
sam
mason
did
call
up
andrew
i
said
it
must
have
looked
mighty
queer
to
him
for
an
old
farm
hand
like
me
to
be
around
peddling
books
he
would
have
done
it
straight
off
said
mifflin
but
you
see
i
cut
his
telephone
wire
chapter
five
i
gazed
in
astonishment
at
the
wizened
little
rogue
here
was
a
new
side
to
the
amiable
idealist
apparently
there
was
a
streak
of
fearless
deviltry
in
him
besides
his
gentle
love
of
books
i
bound
to
say
that
now
for
the
first
time
i
really
admired
him
i
had
burnt
my
own
very
respectable
boats
behind
me
and
i
rather
enjoyed
knowing
that
he
too
could
act
briskly
in
a
pinch
well
i
said
you
are
a
cool
hand
it
a
good
job
for
you
that
you
did
stay
a
schoolmaster
you
might
have
taught
your
pupils
some
fine
deviltries
and
at
your
age
too
i
afraid
my
raillery
goes
a
little
too
far
sometimes
he
flushed
a
bit
at
my
reference
to
his
age
and
puffed
sharply
at
his
pipe
i
say
he
rejoined
how
old
do
you
think
i
am
anyway
only
by
the
bones
of
byron
henry
viii
was
only
when
he
married
anne
boleyn
there
are
many
consolations
in
history
for
people
over
forty
remember
that
when
you
get
there
shakespeare
wrote
lear
at
he
added
more
humorously
and
then
burst
out
laughing
i
like
to
edit
a
series
of
classics
to
include
only
books
written
after
forty
who
was
that
doctor
man
who
recommended
anaesthetics
for
us
at
that
age
now
is
that
just
like
a
medico
nurse
us
through
the
diseases
of
childhood
and
as
soon
as
we
settle
down
into
permanent
good
health
and
worldly
wisdom
and
freedom
from
doctors
fees
why
he
loses
interest
in
us
jove
i
must
note
that
down
and
bring
it
into
my
book
he
pulled
out
a
memorandum
book
and
jotted
down
chloroform
classics
in
a
small
neat
hand
well
i
said
i
felt
a
little
contrite
as
i
was
sincerely
sorry
to
have
offended
him
i
passed
forty
myself
in
some
measurements
so
youth
no
longer
has
any
terrors
for
me
he
looked
at
me
rather
comically
my
dear
madam
he
said
your
age
is
precisely
eighteen
i
think
that
if
we
escape
the
clutches
of
the
sage
of
redfield
you
may
really
begin
to
live
oh
andrew
not
a
bad
sort
i
said
he
absentminded
and
hot
tempered
and
a
little
selfish
the
publishers
have
done
their
best
to
spoil
him
but
for
a
literary
man
i
guess
he
quite
human
he
rescued
me
from
being
a
governess
and
that
to
his
credit
if
only
he
did
take
his
meals
quite
so
much
as
a
matter
of
course
the
preposterous
thing
about
him
is
that
he
really
can
said
mifflin
i
envy
him
that
do
let
him
know
i
said
so
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
prose
is
almost
as
good
as
thoreau
he
approaches
facts
as
daintily
as
a
cat
crossing
a
wet
road
you
should
see
him
at
dinner
i
thought
or
rather
i
meant
to
think
it
but
the
words
slipped
out
i
found
myself
thinking
aloud
in
a
rather
disconcerting
way
while
sitting
with
this
strange
little
person
he
looked
at
me
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
his
eyes
were
slate
blue
with
funny
birds
foot
wrinkles
at
the
corners
that
so
he
said
i
never
thought
of
that
a
fine
prose
style
certainly
presupposes
sound
nourishment
excellent
point
that
and
yet
thoreau
did
his
own
cooking
a
sort
of
boy
scout
i
guess
with
a
badge
as
kitchen
master
perhaps
he
took
beechnut
bacon
with
him
into
the
woods
i
wonder
who
cooked
for
stevenson
cummy
the
garden
of
verses
was
really
a
kind
of
kitchen
garden
was
it
i
afraid
the
commissariat
problem
has
weighed
rather
heavily
on
you
i
glad
you
got
away
from
it
all
this
was
getting
rather
intricate
for
me
i
set
it
down
as
i
remember
it
inaccurately
perhaps
my
governess
days
are
pretty
far
astern
now
and
my
line
is
common
sense
rather
than
literary
allusions
i
said
something
of
the
sort
common
sense
he
repeated
good
lord
sense
is
the
most
uncommon
thing
in
the
world
i
have
got
it
i
do
believe
your
brother
has
from
what
you
say
bock
here
has
it
see
how
he
trots
along
the
road
keeps
an
eye
on
the
scenery
and
minds
his
own
business
i
never
saw
him
get
into
a
fight
yet
wish
i
could
say
the
same
of
myself
i
named
him
after
boccaccio
to
remind
me
to
read
the
some
day
judging
by
the
way
you
talk
i
said
you
ought
to
be
quite
a
writer
yourself
talkers
never
write
they
go
on
talking
there
was
a
considerable
silence
mifflin
relit
his
pipe
and
watched
the
landscape
with
a
shrewd
eye
i
held
the
reins
loosely
and
peg
ambled
along
with
a
steady
parnassus
creaked
musically
and
the
sun
lay
rich
across
the
road
we
passed
another
farm
but
i
did
not
suggest
stopping
as
i
felt
we
ought
to
push
on
mifflin
seemed
lost
in
meditation
and
i
began
to
wonder
a
little
uneasily
how
the
adventure
would
turn
out
this
quaintly
masterful
little
man
was
a
trifle
disconcerting
across
the
next
ridge
i
could
see
the
greenbriar
church
spire
shining
white
do
you
know
this
part
of
the
country
i
asked
finally
not
this
exact
section
i
been
in
port
vigor
often
but
then
i
was
on
the
road
that
runs
along
the
sound
i
suppose
this
village
ahead
is
greenbriar
yes
i
said
it
about
thirteen
miles
from
there
to
port
vigor
how
do
you
expect
to
get
back
to
brooklyn
oh
brooklyn
he
said
vaguely
yes
i
forgotten
about
brooklyn
for
the
minute
i
was
thinking
of
my
book
why
i
guess
i
take
the
train
from
port
vigor
the
trouble
is
you
can
never
get
to
brooklyn
without
going
through
new
york
it
symbolic
i
suppose
again
there
was
a
silence
finally
he
said
is
there
another
town
between
greenbriar
and
port
vigor
yes
shelby
i
said
about
five
miles
from
greenbriar
that
be
as
far
as
you
get
he
said
i
see
you
safe
to
shelby
and
then
make
tracks
for
port
vigor
i
hope
a
decent
inn
at
shelby
where
you
can
stop
overnight
i
hoped
so
too
but
i
was
going
to
let
him
see
that
with
the
waning
afternoon
my
enthusiasm
was
a
little
less
robust
i
was
wondering
what
andrew
was
thinking
and
whether
mcnally
had
left
things
in
good
order
like
most
swedes
she
had
to
be
watched
or
she
left
her
work
only
three
quarters
done
and
i
did
depend
any
too
much
on
her
daughter
rosie
to
do
the
housework
efficiently
i
wondered
what
kind
of
meals
andrew
would
get
and
probably
he
would
go
right
on
wearing
his
summer
underclothes
although
i
had
already
reminded
him
about
changing
then
there
were
the
chickens
well
the
rubicon
was
crossed
now
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
to
my
surprise
little
redbeard
had
divined
my
anxiety
now
you
worry
about
the
sage
he
said
kindly
a
man
that
draws
his
royalties
is
going
to
starve
by
the
bones
of
john
murray
his
publishers
can
send
him
a
cook
if
necessary
this
is
a
holiday
for
you
and
do
you
forget
it
and
with
this
cheering
sentiment
in
my
mind
we
rolled
sedately
down
the
hill
toward
greenbriar
i
am
about
as
hardy
as
most
folks
i
think
but
i
confess
i
balked
a
little
at
the
idea
of
facing
the
various
people
i
know
in
greenbriar
as
the
owner
of
a
bookvan
and
the
companion
of
a
literary
huckster
also
i
recollected
that
if
andrew
should
try
to
trace
us
it
would
be
as
well
for
me
to
keep
out
of
sight
so
after
telling
mifflin
how
i
felt
about
matters
i
dived
into
the
parnassus
and
lay
down
most
comfortably
on
the
bunk
bock
the
terrier
joined
me
and
i
rested
there
in
great
comfort
of
mind
and
body
as
we
ambled
down
the
grade
the
sun
shone
through
the
little
skylight
gilding
a
tin
pan
that
hung
over
the
cook
stove
tacked
here
and
there
were
portraits
of
authors
and
i
noticed
a
faded
newspaper
cutting
pinned
up
the
headlines
ran
literary
pedlar
lectures
on
poetry
i
read
it
through
apparently
the
professor
so
i
had
begun
to
call
him
as
the
aptness
of
the
nickname
stuck
in
my
mind
had
given
a
lecture
in
camden
where
he
had
asserted
that
tennyson
was
a
greater
poet
than
walt
whitman
and
the
boosters
of
the
camden
poet
had
enlivened
the
evening
with
missiles
it
seems
that
the
chief
whitman
disciple
in
camden
is
traubel
and
mifflin
had
started
the
rumpus
by
asserting
that
tennyson
too
had
traubels
of
his
own
what
an
absurd
creature
the
professor
was
i
thought
as
i
lay
comfortably
lulled
by
the
rolling
wheels
greenbriar
is
a
straggling
little
town
built
around
a
large
common
meadow
mifflin
general
plan
in
towns
he
had
told
me
was
to
halt
parnassus
in
front
of
the
principal
store
or
hotel
and
when
a
little
throng
had
gathered
he
would
put
up
the
flaps
of
the
van
distribute
his
cards
and
deliver
a
harangue
on
the
value
of
good
books
i
lay
concealed
inside
but
i
gathered
from
the
sounds
that
this
was
what
was
happening
we
came
to
a
stop
i
heard
a
growing
murmur
of
voices
and
laughter
outside
and
then
the
click
of
the
raised
sides
of
the
wagon
i
heard
mifflin
shrill
slightly
nasal
voice
making
facetious
remarks
as
he
passed
out
the
cards
evidently
bock
was
quite
accustomed
to
the
routine
for
though
his
tail
wagged
gently
when
the
professor
began
to
talk
he
lay
quite
peaceably
dozing
at
my
feet
my
friends
said
mifflin
you
remember
abe
lincoln
joke
about
the
dog
if
you
call
a
tail
a
leg
said
abe
how
many
legs
has
a
dog
five
you
answer
no
says
abe
because
calling
a
tail
a
leg
does
make
it
a
leg
well
there
are
lots
of
us
in
the
same
case
as
that
dog
tail
calling
us
men
does
us
men
no
creature
on
earth
has
a
right
to
think
himself
a
human
being
if
he
does
know
at
least
one
good
book
the
man
that
spends
every
evening
chewing
piper
heidsieck
at
the
store
is
unworthy
to
catch
the
intimations
of
a
benevolent
creator
the
man
that
got
a
few
good
books
on
his
shelf
is
making
his
wife
happy
giving
his
children
a
square
deal
and
he
likely
to
be
a
better
citizen
himself
how
about
that
parson
i
heard
the
deep
voice
of
reverend
kane
the
methodist
minister
you
dead
right
professor
he
shouted
tell
us
some
more
about
books
i
right
with
you
evidently
kane
had
been
attracted
by
the
sight
of
parnassus
and
i
could
hear
him
muttering
to
himself
as
he
pulled
one
or
two
books
from
the
shelves
how
surprised
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
known
i
was
inside
the
van
i
took
the
precaution
of
slipping
the
bolt
of
the
door
at
the
back
and
drew
the
curtains
then
i
crept
back
into
the
bunk
i
began
to
imagine
what
an
absurd
situation
there
would
be
if
andrew
should
arrive
on
the
scene
you
are
all
used
to
hucksters
and
pedlars
and
fellows
selling
every
kind
of
junk
from
brooms
to
bananas
said
the
professor
voice
but
how
often
does
any
one
come
round
here
to
sell
you
books
you
got
your
town
library
i
dare
say
but
there
are
some
books
that
folks
ought
to
own
i
got
all
here
from
bibles
to
cook
books
they
speak
for
themselves
step
up
to
the
shelves
friends
and
pick
and
choose
i
heard
the
parson
asking
the
price
of
something
he
had
found
on
the
shelves
and
i
believe
he
bought
it
but
the
hum
of
voices
around
the
flanks
of
parnassus
was
very
soothing
and
in
spite
of
my
interest
in
what
was
going
on
i
afraid
i
fell
asleep
i
must
have
been
pretty
tired
anyway
i
never
felt
the
van
start
again
the
professor
says
he
looked
in
through
the
little
window
from
the
driver
seat
and
saw
me
sound
asleep
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
woke
up
with
a
start
to
find
myself
rolling
leisurely
in
the
dark
bock
was
still
lying
over
my
feet
and
there
was
a
faint
musical
clang
from
the
bucket
under
the
van
which
struck
against
something
now
and
then
the
professor
was
sitting
in
front
with
a
lighted
lantern
hanging
from
the
peak
of
the
van
roof
he
was
humming
some
outlandish
song
to
himself
with
a
queer
monotonous
refrain
shipwrecked
was
i
off
soft
perowse
and
right
along
the
shore
and
so
i
did
resolve
to
roam
the
country
to
explore
tommy
rip
fal
lal
and
a
balum
tip
tommy
rip
fal
lal
i
dee
and
so
i
did
resolve
to
roam
the
country
for
to
see
i
jumped
out
of
the
bunk
cracked
my
shins
against
something
and
uttered
a
rousing
halloo
parnassus
stopped
and
the
professor
pushed
back
the
sliding
window
behind
the
driver
seat
heavens
i
said
father
time
what
is
it
pretty
near
supper
time
i
reckon
you
must
have
fallen
asleep
while
i
was
taking
money
from
the
philistines
i
made
nearly
three
dollars
for
you
let
pull
up
along
the
road
and
have
a
bite
to
eat
he
guided
pegasus
to
one
side
of
the
road
and
then
showed
me
how
to
light
the
swinging
lamp
that
hung
under
the
skylight
no
use
to
light
the
stove
on
a
lovely
evening
like
this
he
said
collect
some
sticks
and
we
can
cook
outside
you
get
out
your
basket
of
grub
and
i
make
a
fire
he
unhitched
pegasus
tied
her
to
a
tree
and
gave
her
a
nose
bag
of
oats
then
he
rooted
around
for
some
twigs
and
had
a
fire
going
in
a
jiffy
in
five
minutes
i
had
bacon
and
scrambled
eggs
sizzling
in
a
frying
pan
and
he
had
brought
out
a
pail
of
water
from
the
cooler
under
the
bunk
and
was
making
tea
i
never
enjoyed
a
picnic
so
much
it
was
a
perfect
autumn
evening
windless
and
frosty
with
a
dead
black
sky
and
a
tiny
rim
of
new
moon
like
a
paring
we
had
our
eggs
and
bacon
washed
down
with
tea
and
condensed
milk
and
followed
by
bread
and
jam
the
little
fire
burned
blue
and
cozy
and
we
sat
on
each
side
of
it
while
bock
scoured
the
pan
and
ate
the
crusts
this
your
own
bread
miss
mcgill
he
asked
yes
i
said
i
was
calculating
the
other
day
that
i
baked
more
than
loaves
a
year
for
the
last
fifteen
years
that
more
than
loaves
of
bread
they
can
put
that
on
my
tombstone
the
art
of
baking
bread
is
as
transcendent
a
mystery
as
the
art
of
making
sonnets
said
redbeard
and
then
your
hot
biscuits
they
might
be
counted
as
shorter
lyrics
i
suppose
triolets
perhaps
that
makes
quite
an
anthology
or
a
doxology
if
you
prefer
it
yeast
is
yeast
and
west
is
west
i
said
and
was
quite
surprised
at
my
own
cleverness
i
had
made
a
remark
like
that
to
andrew
in
five
years
i
see
you
are
acquainted
with
kipling
he
said
oh
yes
every
governess
is
where
and
whom
did
you
govern
i
was
in
new
york
with
the
family
of
a
wealthy
stockbroker
there
were
three
children
i
used
to
take
them
walking
in
central
park
did
you
ever
go
to
brooklyn
he
asked
abruptly
never
i
replied
ah
he
said
that
just
the
trouble
new
york
is
babylon
brooklyn
is
the
true
holy
city
new
york
is
the
city
of
envy
office
work
and
hustle
brooklyn
is
the
region
of
homes
and
happiness
it
is
extraordinary
poor
harassed
new
yorkers
presume
to
look
down
on
brooklyn
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
precious
jewel
their
souls
are
thirsting
for
and
they
never
know
it
broadway
think
how
symbolic
the
name
is
broad
is
the
way
that
leadeth
to
destruction
but
in
brooklyn
the
ways
are
narrow
and
they
lead
to
the
heavenly
city
of
content
central
park
there
you
are
the
centre
of
things
hemmed
in
by
walls
of
pride
now
how
much
better
is
prospect
park
giving
a
fair
view
over
the
hills
of
humility
there
is
no
hope
for
new
yorkers
for
they
glory
in
their
skyscraping
sins
but
in
brooklyn
there
is
the
wisdom
of
the
lowly
so
you
think
that
if
i
had
been
a
governess
in
brooklyn
i
should
have
been
so
contented
that
i
would
never
have
come
with
andrew
and
compiled
my
anthology
of
loaves
of
bread
and
the
lesser
lyrics
but
the
volatile
professor
had
already
soared
to
other
points
of
view
and
was
not
to
be
thwarted
by
argument
of
course
brooklyn
is
a
dingy
place
really
he
admitted
but
to
me
it
symbolizes
a
state
of
mind
whereas
new
york
is
only
a
state
of
pocket
you
see
i
was
a
boy
in
brooklyn
it
still
trails
clouds
of
glory
for
me
when
i
get
back
there
and
start
work
on
my
book
i
shall
be
as
happy
as
nebuchadnezzar
when
he
left
off
grass
and
returned
to
tea
and
crumpets
among
the
farmers
going
to
call
it
but
that
a
poor
title
i
like
to
read
you
some
of
my
notes
for
it
i
afraid
i
poorly
concealed
a
yawn
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
sleepy
and
it
was
growing
chilly
tell
me
first
i
said
where
in
the
world
are
we
and
what
time
is
it
he
pulled
out
a
turnip
watch
it
nine
he
said
and
we
about
two
miles
from
shelby
i
should
reckon
perhaps
better
get
along
they
told
me
in
greenbriar
that
the
grand
central
hotel
in
shelby
is
a
good
place
to
stop
at
that
why
i
anxious
to
get
there
it
sounds
so
darned
like
new
york
he
bundled
the
cooking
utensils
back
into
parnassus
hitched
peg
up
again
and
tied
bock
to
the
stern
of
the
van
then
he
insisted
on
giving
me
the
two
dollars
and
eighty
cents
he
had
collected
in
greenbriar
i
was
really
too
sleepy
to
protest
and
of
course
it
was
mine
anyway
we
creaked
off
along
the
dark
and
silent
road
between
the
pine
woods
i
think
he
talked
fluently
about
his
progress
among
the
farmers
of
a
dozen
states
but
to
be
honest
i
fell
asleep
in
my
corner
of
the
seat
i
woke
up
when
we
halted
before
the
one
hotel
in
shelby
a
plain
unimposing
country
inn
despite
its
absurd
name
i
left
him
to
put
parnassus
and
the
animals
away
for
the
night
while
i
engaged
a
room
just
as
i
got
my
key
from
the
clerk
he
came
into
the
dingy
lobby
well
mifflin
i
said
shall
i
see
you
in
the
morning
i
had
intended
to
push
on
to
port
vigor
he
said
but
as
it
fully
eight
miles
they
tell
me
i
guess
i
bivouac
here
i
think
i
go
into
the
and
put
them
wise
to
some
good
books
we
wo
say
till
my
room
was
pleasant
and
clean
fairly
so
i
took
my
suit
case
up
with
me
and
had
a
hot
bath
as
i
fell
asleep
i
heard
a
shrill
voice
ascending
from
below
punctuated
with
masculine
laughter
the
pilgrim
was
making
more
converts
chapter
six
i
had
a
curious
feeling
of
bewilderment
when
i
woke
the
next
morning
the
bare
room
with
the
rag
carpet
and
green
china
toilet
set
was
utterly
strange
in
the
hall
outside
i
heard
a
clock
strike
heavens
i
thought
i
overslept
myself
nearly
two
hours
what
on
earth
will
andrew
do
for
breakfast
and
then
as
i
ran
to
close
the
window
i
saw
the
blue
parnassus
with
its
startling
red
letters
standing
in
the
yard
instantly
i
remembered
and
discreetly
peeping
from
behind
the
window
shade
i
saw
that
the
professor
armed
with
a
tin
of
paint
was
blotting
out
his
own
name
on
the
side
of
the
van
evidently
intending
to
substitute
mine
that
was
something
i
had
not
thought
of
however
i
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
i
dressed
promptly
repacked
my
bag
and
hurried
downstairs
for
breakfast
the
long
table
was
nearly
empty
but
one
or
two
men
sitting
at
the
other
end
eyed
me
curiously
through
the
window
i
could
see
my
name
in
large
red
letters
growing
on
the
side
of
the
van
as
the
professor
diligently
wielded
his
brush
and
when
i
had
finished
my
coffee
and
beans
and
bacon
i
noticed
with
some
amusement
that
the
professor
had
painted
out
the
line
about
shakespeare
charles
lamb
and
so
on
and
had
substituted
new
lettering
the
sign
now
read
travelling
parnassus
good
books
for
sale
cook
books
a
specialty
inquire
within
evidently
he
distrusted
my
familiarity
with
the
classics
i
paid
my
bill
at
the
desk
and
was
careful
also
to
pay
the
charge
for
putting
up
the
horse
and
van
overnight
then
i
strolled
into
the
stable
yard
where
i
found
mifflin
regarding
his
handiwork
with
satisfaction
he
had
freshened
up
all
the
red
lettering
which
shone
brilliantly
in
the
morning
sunlight
i
said
he
returned
it
there
he
cried
parnassus
is
really
yours
all
the
world
lies
before
you
and
i
got
some
more
money
for
you
i
sold
some
books
last
night
i
persuaded
the
hotel
keeper
to
buy
several
volumes
of
henry
for
his
shelf
and
i
sold
the
cook
book
to
the
cook
my
was
her
coffee
awful
i
hope
the
cook
book
will
better
it
he
handed
me
two
limp
bills
and
a
handful
of
small
change
i
took
it
gravely
and
put
it
in
my
purse
this
was
really
not
bad
more
than
ten
dollars
in
less
than
hours
parnassus
seems
to
be
a
gold
mine
i
said
which
way
do
you
think
you
go
he
asked
well
as
i
know
you
want
to
get
to
port
vigor
i
might
just
as
well
give
you
a
lift
that
way
i
answered
good
i
was
hoping
you
say
that
they
tell
me
the
stage
for
port
vigor
does
leave
till
noon
and
i
think
it
would
kill
me
to
hang
around
here
all
morning
with
no
books
to
sell
once
i
get
on
the
train
i
be
all
right
bock
was
tied
up
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
under
the
side
door
of
the
hotel
i
went
over
to
release
him
while
the
professor
was
putting
peg
into
harness
as
i
stooped
to
unfasten
the
chain
from
his
collar
i
heard
some
one
talking
through
the
telephone
the
hotel
lobby
was
just
over
my
head
and
the
window
was
open
what
did
you
say
mcgill
yes
sir
registered
here
last
night
she
here
now
i
did
wait
to
hear
more
unfastening
bock
i
hurried
to
tell
mifflin
his
eyes
sparkled
the
sage
is
evidently
on
our
spoor
he
chuckled
well
let
be
off
i
do
see
what
he
can
do
even
if
he
overhauls
us
the
clerk
was
calling
me
from
the
window
miss
mcgill
your
brother
on
the
wire
and
asks
to
speak
to
you
tell
him
i
busy
i
retorted
and
climbed
onto
the
seat
it
was
not
a
diplomatic
reply
i
afraid
but
i
was
too
exhilarated
by
the
keen
morning
and
the
spirit
of
adventure
to
stop
to
think
of
a
better
answer
mifflin
clucked
to
peg
and
off
we
went
the
road
from
shelby
to
port
vigor
runs
across
the
broad
hill
slopes
that
trend
toward
the
sound
and
below
on
our
left
the
river
lay
glittering
in
the
valley
it
was
a
perfect
landscape
the
woods
were
all
bronze
and
gold
the
clouds
were
snowy
white
and
seemed
like
heavenly
washing
hung
out
to
air
the
sun
was
warm
and
swam
gloriously
in
an
arch
of
superb
blue
my
heart
was
uplifted
indeed
for
the
first
time
i
think
i
knew
how
andrew
feels
on
those
vagabond
trips
of
his
why
had
all
this
been
hidden
from
me
before
why
had
the
transcendent
mystery
of
baking
bread
blinded
me
so
long
to
the
mysteries
of
sun
and
sky
and
wind
in
the
trees
we
passed
a
white
farmhouse
close
to
the
road
by
the
gate
sat
the
farmer
on
a
log
whittling
a
stick
and
smoking
his
pipe
through
the
kitchen
window
i
could
see
a
woman
blacking
the
stove
i
wanted
to
cry
out
oh
silly
woman
leave
your
stove
your
pots
and
pans
and
chores
even
if
only
for
one
day
come
out
and
see
the
sun
in
the
sky
and
the
river
in
the
distance
the
farmer
looked
blankly
at
parnassus
as
we
passed
and
then
i
remembered
my
mission
as
a
distributor
of
literature
mifflin
was
sitting
with
one
foot
on
his
bulging
portmanteau
watching
the
tree
tops
rocking
in
the
cool
wind
he
seemed
to
be
far
away
in
a
morning
muse
i
threw
down
the
reins
and
accosted
the
farmer
friend
morning
to
you
he
said
firmly
i
selling
books
i
said
i
wonder
if
there
is
something
you
need
thanks
lady
he
said
but
i
bought
a
mort
o
books
last
year
i
do
believe
i
ever
read
this
side
jordan
a
whole
set
orations
what
an
agent
left
on
me
at
a
dollar
a
month
i
could
qualify
as
earnest
mourner
at
any
merrymakin
now
i
reckon
you
need
some
books
to
teach
you
how
to
live
not
how
to
die
i
said
how
about
your
wife
would
she
enjoy
a
good
book
how
about
some
fairy
tales
for
the
children
bless
me
he
said
i
ai
got
a
wife
i
never
was
a
daring
man
and
i
guess
i
confine
my
melancholy
pleasures
to
them
funereal
orators
for
some
time
yet
well
now
hold
on
a
minute
i
exclaimed
i
got
just
the
thing
for
you
i
had
been
looking
over
the
shelves
with
some
care
and
remembered
seeing
a
copy
of
reveries
of
a
bachelor
i
clambered
down
raised
the
flap
of
the
van
it
gave
me
quite
a
thrill
to
do
it
myself
for
the
first
time
and
hunted
out
the
book
i
looked
inside
the
cover
and
saw
the
letters
in
mifflin
neat
hand
here
you
are
i
said
i
sell
you
that
for
thirty
cents
thank
you
kindly
he
said
courteously
but
honestly
i
would
know
what
to
do
with
it
i
am
working
through
a
government
report
on
scabworm
and
fungus
and
i
sandwich
in
a
little
of
them
funereal
speeches
with
it
and
honestly
that
about
all
the
i
figure
on
that
an
the
port
vigor
clarion
i
saw
that
he
really
meant
it
so
i
climbed
back
on
the
seat
i
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
the
woman
in
the
kitchen
who
was
peering
out
of
the
window
in
amazement
but
i
decided
it
would
be
better
to
jog
on
and
not
waste
time
the
farmer
and
i
exchanged
friendly
salutes
and
parnassus
rumbled
on
the
morning
was
so
lovely
that
i
did
not
feel
talkative
and
as
the
professor
seemed
pensive
i
said
nothing
but
as
peg
plodded
slowly
up
a
gentle
slope
he
suddenly
pulled
a
book
out
of
his
pocket
and
began
to
read
aloud
i
was
watching
the
river
and
did
not
turn
round
but
listened
carefully
rolling
cloud
volleying
wind
and
wheeling
sun
the
blue
tabernacle
of
sky
the
circle
of
the
seasons
the
sparkling
multitude
of
the
stars
all
these
are
surely
part
of
one
rhythmic
mystic
whole
everywhere
as
we
go
about
our
small
business
we
must
discern
the
fingerprints
of
the
gigantic
plan
the
orderly
and
inexorable
routine
with
neither
beginning
nor
end
in
which
death
is
but
a
preface
to
another
birth
and
birth
the
certain
forerunner
of
another
death
we
human
beings
are
as
powerless
to
conceive
the
motive
or
the
moral
of
it
all
as
the
dog
is
powerless
to
understand
the
reasoning
in
his
master
mind
he
sees
the
master
acts
benevolent
or
malevolent
and
wags
his
tail
but
the
master
acts
are
always
inscrutable
to
him
and
so
with
us
and
therefore
brethren
let
us
take
the
road
with
a
light
heart
let
us
praise
the
bronze
of
the
leaves
and
the
crash
of
the
surf
while
we
have
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
an
honest
amazement
at
the
unspeakable
beauties
of
the
world
is
a
comely
posture
for
the
scholar
let
us
all
be
scholars
under
mother
nature
eye
how
do
you
like
that
he
asked
a
little
heavy
but
very
good
i
said
there
nothing
in
it
about
the
transcendent
mystery
of
baking
bread
he
looked
rather
blank
do
you
know
who
wrote
it
he
asked
i
made
a
valiant
effort
to
summon
some
of
my
governessly
recollections
of
literature
i
give
it
up
i
said
feebly
is
it
carlyle
that
is
by
andrew
mcgill
he
said
one
of
his
cosmic
passages
which
are
now
beginning
to
be
reprinted
in
schoolbooks
the
blighter
writes
well
i
began
to
be
uneasy
lest
i
should
be
put
through
a
literary
catechism
so
i
said
nothing
but
roused
peg
into
an
amble
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
more
curious
to
hear
the
professor
talk
about
his
own
book
than
about
andrew
i
had
always
carefully
refrained
from
reading
andrew
stuff
as
i
thought
it
rather
dull
as
for
me
said
the
professor
i
have
no
facility
at
the
grand
style
i
have
always
suffered
from
the
feeling
that
it
better
to
read
a
good
book
than
to
write
a
poor
one
and
i
done
so
much
mixed
reading
in
my
time
that
my
mind
is
full
of
echoes
and
voices
of
better
men
but
this
book
i
worrying
about
now
really
deserves
to
be
written
i
think
for
it
has
a
message
of
its
own
he
gazed
almost
wistfully
across
the
sunny
valley
in
the
distance
i
caught
a
glint
of
the
sound
the
professor
faded
tweed
cap
was
slanted
over
one
ear
and
his
stubby
little
beard
shone
bright
red
in
the
sun
i
kept
a
sympathetic
silence
he
seemed
pleased
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
about
his
precious
book
the
world
is
full
of
great
writers
about
literature
he
said
but
they
all
selfish
and
aristocratic
addison
lamb
hazlitt
emerson
lowell
take
any
one
you
choose
they
all
conceive
the
love
of
books
as
a
rare
and
perfect
mystery
for
the
few
a
thing
of
the
secluded
study
where
they
can
sit
alone
at
night
with
a
candle
and
a
cigar
and
a
glass
of
port
on
the
table
and
a
spaniel
on
the
hearthrug
what
i
say
is
who
has
ever
gone
out
into
high
roads
and
hedges
to
bring
literature
home
to
the
plain
man
to
bring
it
home
to
his
business
and
bosom
as
somebody
says
the
farther
into
the
country
you
go
the
fewer
and
worse
books
you
find
i
spent
several
years
joggling
around
with
this
citadel
of
crime
and
by
the
bones
of
ben
ezra
i
do
think
i
ever
found
a
really
good
book
except
the
bible
at
a
farmhouse
yet
unless
i
put
it
there
myself
the
mandarins
of
culture
what
do
they
do
to
teach
the
common
folk
to
read
it
no
good
writing
down
lists
of
books
for
farmers
and
compiling
shelves
you
got
to
go
out
and
visit
the
people
yourself
take
the
books
to
them
talk
to
the
teachers
and
bully
the
editors
of
country
newspapers
and
farm
magazines
and
tell
the
children
stories
and
then
little
by
little
you
begin
to
get
good
books
circulating
in
the
veins
of
the
nation
it
a
great
work
mind
you
it
like
carrying
the
holy
grail
to
some
of
these
farmhouses
and
i
wish
there
were
a
thousand
parnassuses
instead
of
this
one
i
never
give
it
up
if
it
were
for
my
book
but
i
want
to
write
about
my
ideas
in
the
hope
of
stirring
other
folk
up
too
i
do
suppose
there
a
publisher
in
the
country
will
take
it
try
decameron
i
said
he
always
been
very
nice
to
andrew
think
what
it
would
mean
he
cried
waving
an
eloquent
hand
if
some
rich
man
would
start
a
fund
to
equip
a
hundred
or
so
wagons
like
this
to
go
huckstering
literature
around
through
the
rural
districts
it
would
pay
too
once
you
got
started
yes
by
the
bones
of
webster
i
went
to
a
meeting
of
booksellers
once
at
some
hotel
in
new
york
and
told
about
my
scheme
they
laughed
at
me
but
i
had
more
fun
toting
books
around
in
this
parnassus
than
i
could
have
had
in
fifty
years
sitting
in
a
bookstore
or
teaching
school
or
preaching
life
full
of
savour
when
you
go
creaking
along
the
road
like
this
look
at
today
with
the
sun
and
the
air
and
the
silver
clouds
best
of
all
though
i
love
the
rainy
days
i
used
to
pull
up
alongside
the
road
throw
a
rubber
blanket
over
peg
and
bock
and
i
would
curl
up
in
the
bunk
and
smoke
and
read
i
used
to
read
aloud
to
bock
we
went
through
easy
together
and
a
good
deal
of
shakespeare
he
a
very
bookish
dog
we
seen
some
queer
experiences
in
this
parnassus
the
hill
road
from
shelby
to
port
vigor
is
a
lonely
one
as
most
of
the
farmhouses
lie
down
in
the
valley
if
i
had
known
better
we
might
have
taken
the
longer
and
more
populous
way
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
enjoying
the
wide
view
and
the
solitary
road
lying
white
in
the
sunshine
we
jogged
along
very
pleasantly
once
more
we
stopped
at
a
house
where
mifflin
pleaded
for
a
chance
to
exercise
his
art
i
was
much
amused
when
he
succeeded
in
selling
a
copy
of
grimm
fairy
tales
to
a
shrewish
spinster
on
the
plea
that
she
would
enjoy
reading
the
stories
to
her
nephews
and
nieces
who
were
coming
to
visit
her
my
he
chuckled
as
he
gave
me
the
dingy
quarter
he
had
extracted
there
nothing
in
that
book
as
grim
as
she
is
a
little
farther
on
we
halted
by
a
roadside
spring
to
give
peg
a
drink
and
i
suggested
lunch
i
had
laid
in
some
bread
and
cheese
in
shelby
and
with
this
and
some
jam
we
made
excellent
sandwiches
as
we
were
sitting
by
the
fence
the
motor
stage
trundled
past
on
its
way
to
port
vigor
a
little
distance
down
the
road
it
halted
and
then
went
on
again
i
saw
a
familiar
figure
walking
back
toward
us
now
i
in
for
it
i
said
to
the
professor
here
andrew
chapter
seven
andrew
is
just
as
thin
as
i
am
fat
and
his
clothes
hang
on
him
in
the
most
comical
way
he
is
very
tall
and
shambling
wears
a
ragged
beard
and
a
broad
stetson
hat
and
suffers
amazingly
from
hay
fever
in
the
autumn
in
fact
his
essay
on
hay
fever
is
the
best
thing
he
ever
wrote
i
think
as
he
came
striding
up
the
road
i
noticed
how
his
trousers
fluttered
at
the
ankles
as
the
wind
plucked
at
them
the
breeze
curled
his
beard
back
under
his
chin
and
his
face
was
quite
dark
with
anger
i
could
help
being
amused
he
looked
so
funny
the
sage
looks
like
bernard
shaw
whispered
mifflin
i
always
believe
in
drawing
first
blood
andrew
i
called
cheerfully
want
to
buy
any
books
i
halted
pegasus
and
andrew
stood
a
little
in
front
of
the
wheel
partly
out
of
breath
and
mostly
out
of
temper
what
on
earth
is
this
nonsense
helen
he
said
angrily
led
me
the
deuce
of
a
chase
since
yesterday
and
who
is
this
this
person
you
driving
with
andrew
i
said
you
forget
your
manners
let
me
introduce
mifflin
i
have
bought
his
caravan
and
am
taking
a
holiday
selling
books
mifflin
is
on
his
way
to
port
vigor
where
he
takes
the
train
to
brooklyn
andrew
stared
at
the
professor
without
speaking
i
could
tell
by
the
blaze
in
his
eyes
that
he
was
thoroughly
angry
and
i
feared
things
would
be
worse
before
they
were
better
andrew
is
slow
to
wrath
but
a
very
hard
person
to
deal
with
when
roused
and
i
had
some
inkling
by
this
time
of
the
professor
temperament
moreover
i
am
afraid
that
some
of
my
remarks
had
rather
prejudiced
him
against
andrew
as
a
brother
at
any
rate
and
apart
from
his
excellent
prose
mifflin
had
the
next
word
he
had
taken
off
his
funny
little
cap
and
his
bare
skull
shone
like
an
egg
i
noticed
a
little
sort
of
fairy
ring
of
tiny
drops
around
his
crown
my
dear
sir
said
mifflin
the
proceedings
look
somewhat
unusual
but
the
facts
are
simple
to
narrate
your
sister
has
bought
this
van
and
its
contents
and
i
have
been
instructing
her
in
my
theories
of
the
dissemination
of
good
books
you
as
a
literary
man
andrew
paid
absolutely
no
attention
to
the
professor
and
i
saw
a
slow
flush
tinge
mifflin
sallow
cheek
look
here
helen
said
andrew
do
you
think
i
propose
to
have
my
sister
careering
around
the
state
with
a
strolling
vagabond
upon
my
soul
you
ought
to
have
better
sense
and
at
your
age
and
weight
i
got
home
yesterday
and
found
your
ridiculous
note
i
went
to
collins
and
she
knew
nothing
i
went
to
mason
and
found
him
wondering
who
had
bilked
his
telephone
i
suppose
you
did
that
he
had
seen
this
freight
car
of
yours
and
put
me
on
the
track
but
my
god
i
never
thought
to
see
a
woman
of
forty
abducted
by
gypsies
mifflin
was
about
to
speak
but
i
waved
him
back
now
see
here
andrew
i
said
you
talk
too
quickly
a
woman
of
forty
you
exaggerate
by
the
way
who
has
compiled
an
anthology
of
loaves
of
bread
and
dedicated
it
to
you
deserves
some
courtesy
when
want
to
run
off
on
some
vagabond
tour
or
other
you
do
hesitate
to
do
it
you
expect
me
to
stay
home
and
do
the
lady
eglantine
in
the
poultry
yard
by
the
ghost
of
susan
anthony
i
wo
do
it
this
is
the
first
real
holiday
i
had
in
fifteen
years
and
i
going
to
suit
myself
andrew
mouth
opened
but
i
shook
my
fist
so
convincingly
that
he
halted
i
bought
this
parnassus
from
mifflin
fair
and
square
for
four
hundred
dollars
that
the
price
of
about
thirteen
hundred
dozen
eggs
i
said
i
had
worked
this
out
in
my
head
while
mifflin
was
talking
about
his
book
the
money
mine
and
i
going
to
use
it
my
own
way
now
andrew
mcgill
if
you
want
to
buy
any
books
you
can
parley
with
me
otherwise
i
on
my
way
you
can
expect
me
back
when
you
see
me
i
handed
him
one
of
mifflin
little
cards
which
were
in
a
pocket
at
the
side
of
the
van
and
gathered
up
the
reins
i
was
really
angry
for
andrew
had
been
both
unreasonable
and
insulting
andrew
looked
at
the
card
and
tore
it
in
halves
he
looked
at
the
side
of
parnassus
where
the
fresh
red
lettering
was
still
damp
well
upon
my
word
he
said
you
must
be
crazy
he
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
sneezing
a
last
touch
of
hay
fever
i
suspect
as
there
was
still
goldenrod
in
the
meadows
he
coughed
and
sneezed
furiously
which
made
him
madder
than
ever
at
last
he
turned
to
mifflin
who
was
sitting
with
a
flushed
face
and
very
bright
eyes
andrew
took
him
all
in
the
shabby
norfolk
jacket
the
bulging
memorandum
book
in
his
pocket
the
stuffed
portmanteau
under
his
foot
even
the
copy
of
happiness
and
hayseed
which
had
dropped
to
the
floor
and
lay
back
up
look
here
you
said
andrew
i
do
know
by
what
infernal
arts
you
cajoled
my
sister
away
to
go
vagabonding
in
a
huckster
wagon
but
i
know
this
that
if
you
cheated
her
out
of
her
money
have
the
law
on
you
i
tried
to
insert
a
word
of
protest
but
matters
had
gone
too
far
the
professor
was
as
mad
as
andrew
now
by
the
bones
of
piers
plowman
he
said
i
had
expected
to
meet
a
man
of
letters
and
the
author
of
this
book
he
held
up
happiness
and
hayseed
but
i
see
i
was
mistaken
i
tell
you
sir
a
man
who
would
insult
his
sister
before
a
stranger
as
you
have
done
is
an
oaf
and
a
cad
he
threw
the
book
over
the
hedge
and
before
i
could
say
a
word
he
had
vaulted
over
the
off
wheel
and
ran
round
behind
the
van
look
here
sir
he
said
with
his
little
red
beard
bristling
your
sister
is
over
age
and
acting
of
her
own
free
will
by
the
bones
of
the
baptist
i
do
blame
her
for
wanting
a
vacation
if
this
is
the
way
you
treat
her
she
is
nothing
to
me
sir
and
i
am
nothing
to
her
but
i
propose
to
be
a
teacher
to
you
put
up
your
hands
and
i
give
you
a
lesson
this
was
too
much
for
me
i
believe
i
screamed
aloud
and
started
to
clamber
from
the
van
but
before
i
could
do
anything
the
two
fanatics
had
begun
to
pummel
each
other
i
saw
andrew
swing
savagely
at
mifflin
and
mifflin
hit
him
square
on
the
chin
andrew
hat
fell
on
the
road
peg
stood
placidly
and
bock
made
as
if
to
grab
andrew
leg
but
i
hopped
out
and
seized
him
it
was
certainly
a
weird
sight
i
suppose
i
should
have
wrung
my
hands
and
had
hysterics
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
almost
amused
it
was
so
silly
thank
goodness
the
road
was
deserted
andrew
was
a
foot
taller
than
the
professor
but
awkward
loosely
knit
and
unmuscular
while
the
little
redbeard
was
wiry
as
a
cat
also
andrew
was
so
furious
that
he
was
quite
beside
himself
and
mifflin
was
in
the
cold
anger
that
always
wins
andrew
landed
a
couple
of
flailing
blows
on
the
other
man
chest
and
shoulders
but
in
thirty
seconds
he
got
another
punch
on
the
chin
followed
by
one
on
the
nose
that
tumbled
him
over
backward
andrew
sat
in
the
road
fishing
for
a
handkerchief
and
mifflin
stood
glaring
at
him
but
looking
very
ill
at
ease
neither
of
them
said
a
word
bock
broke
away
from
me
and
capered
and
danced
about
feet
as
if
it
were
all
a
game
it
was
an
extraordinary
scene
andrew
got
up
mopping
his
bleeding
nose
upon
my
soul
he
said
i
almost
respect
you
for
that
punch
but
by
jove
i
have
the
law
on
you
for
kidnapping
my
sister
you
a
fine
kind
of
a
pirate
mifflin
said
nothing
do
be
a
fool
andrew
i
said
ca
you
see
that
i
want
a
little
adventure
of
my
own
go
home
and
bake
six
thousand
loaves
of
bread
and
by
the
time
they
done
i
be
back
again
i
think
two
men
of
your
age
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
i
going
off
to
sell
books
and
with
that
i
climbed
up
to
the
seat
and
clucked
to
pegasus
andrew
and
mifflin
and
bock
remained
standing
in
the
road
i
was
mad
all
the
way
through
i
was
mad
at
both
men
for
behaving
like
schoolboys
i
was
mad
at
andrew
for
being
so
unreasonable
yet
in
a
way
i
admired
him
for
it
i
was
mad
at
mifflin
for
giving
andrew
a
bloody
nose
and
yet
i
appreciated
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
done
i
was
mad
at
myself
for
causing
all
the
trouble
and
i
was
mad
at
parnassus
if
there
had
been
a
convenient
cliff
handy
i
would
have
pushed
the
old
thing
over
it
but
now
i
was
in
for
it
and
just
had
to
go
on
slowly
i
rolled
up
a
long
grade
and
then
saw
port
vigor
lying
ahead
and
the
broad
blue
stretches
of
the
sound
parnassus
rumbled
on
with
its
pleasant
creak
and
the
mellow
sun
and
sweep
of
the
air
soon
soothed
me
i
began
to
taste
salt
in
the
wind
and
above
the
meadows
two
or
three
seagulls
were
circling
like
all
women
my
angry
mood
melted
into
a
reaction
of
exaggerated
tenderness
and
i
began
to
praise
both
andrew
and
mifflin
in
my
heart
how
fine
to
have
a
brother
so
solicitous
of
his
welfare
and
reputation
and
yet
how
splendid
the
little
scrawny
professor
had
been
how
quick
to
resent
an
insult
and
how
bold
to
avenge
it
his
absurd
little
tweed
cap
was
lying
on
the
seat
and
i
picked
it
up
almost
sentimentally
the
lining
was
frayed
and
torn
from
my
suit
case
in
the
van
i
got
out
a
small
sewing
kit
and
hanging
the
reins
on
a
hook
i
began
to
stitch
up
the
rents
as
peg
jogged
along
i
thought
with
amusement
of
the
quaint
life
mifflin
had
led
in
his
caravan
of
culture
i
imagined
him
addressing
the
audience
of
whitman
disciples
in
camden
and
wondered
how
the
fuss
ended
i
imagined
him
in
his
beloved
brooklyn
strolling
in
prospect
park
and
preaching
to
chance
comers
his
gospel
of
good
books
how
different
was
his
militant
love
of
literature
from
andrew
quiet
satisfaction
and
yet
how
much
they
really
had
in
common
it
tickled
me
to
think
of
mifflin
reading
aloud
from
happiness
and
hayseed
and
praising
it
so
highly
just
before
fighting
with
the
author
and
giving
him
a
bloody
nose
i
remembered
that
i
should
have
spoken
to
andrew
about
feeding
the
hens
and
reminded
him
of
his
winter
undergarments
what
helpless
creatures
men
are
after
all
i
finished
mending
the
cap
in
high
good
humour
i
had
hardly
laid
it
down
when
i
heard
a
quick
step
in
the
road
behind
me
and
looking
back
there
was
mifflin
striding
along
with
his
bald
pate
covered
with
little
beads
of
moisture
bock
trotted
sedately
at
his
heels
i
halted
peg
well
i
said
what
happened
to
andrew
the
professor
still
looked
a
bit
shamefaced
the
sage
is
a
tenacious
person
he
said
we
argued
for
a
bit
without
much
satisfaction
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
nearly
came
to
blows
again
only
he
got
another
waft
of
goldenrod
which
started
him
sneezing
and
then
his
nose
began
bleeding
once
more
he
is
convinced
that
i
a
ruffian
and
said
so
in
excellent
prose
honestly
i
admire
him
a
great
deal
i
believe
he
intends
to
have
the
law
on
me
i
gave
him
my
brooklyn
address
in
case
he
wants
to
follow
the
matter
up
i
think
i
rather
pleased
him
by
asking
him
to
autograph
and
hayseed
for
me
i
found
it
lying
in
the
ditch
well
i
said
you
two
are
certainly
a
great
pair
of
lunatics
you
both
ought
to
go
on
the
stage
you
be
as
good
as
weber
and
fields
did
he
give
you
the
autograph
he
pulled
the
book
out
of
his
pocket
scrawled
in
it
in
pencil
were
the
words
i
have
shed
blood
for
mifflin
andrew
mcgill
i
shall
read
the
book
again
with
renewed
interest
said
mifflin
may
i
get
in
by
all
means
i
said
there
port
vigor
in
front
of
us
he
put
on
his
cap
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
feel
different
pulled
it
off
again
and
then
looked
at
me
in
a
quaint
embarrassment
you
are
very
good
miss
mcgill
he
said
where
did
andrew
go
i
asked
he
set
off
for
shelby
on
foot
mifflin
answered
he
has
a
grand
stride
for
walking
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
left
some
potatoes
boiling
on
the
fire
yesterday
afternoon
and
said
he
must
get
back
to
attend
to
them
he
said
he
hoped
you
would
send
him
a
postal
card
now
and
then
do
you
know
he
reminds
me
of
thoreau
more
than
ever
he
reminds
me
of
a
burnt
cooking
pot
i
said
i
suppose
all
my
kitchenware
will
be
in
a
horrible
state
when
i
get
home
chapter
eight
port
vigor
is
a
fascinating
old
town
it
is
built
on
a
point
jutting
out
into
the
sound
dimly
in
the
distance
one
can
see
the
end
of
long
island
which
mifflin
viewed
with
sparkling
eyes
it
seemed
to
bring
him
closer
to
brooklyn
several
schooners
were
beating
along
the
estuary
in
the
fresh
wind
and
there
was
a
delicious
tang
of
brine
in
the
air
we
drove
direct
to
the
station
where
the
professor
alighted
we
took
his
portmanteau
and
shut
bock
inside
the
van
to
prevent
the
dog
from
following
him
then
there
was
an
awkward
pause
as
he
stood
by
the
wheel
with
his
cap
off
well
miss
mcgill
he
said
there
an
express
train
at
five
so
with
luck
i
shall
be
in
brooklyn
my
address
is
abingdon
avenue
and
i
hope
when
you
sending
a
card
to
the
sage
you
let
me
have
one
too
i
shall
be
very
homesick
for
parnassus
but
i
rather
leave
her
with
you
than
with
any
one
i
know
he
bowed
very
low
and
before
i
could
say
a
word
he
blew
his
nose
violently
and
hurried
away
i
saw
him
carrying
his
valise
into
the
station
and
then
he
disappeared
i
suppose
that
living
alone
with
andrew
for
all
these
years
has
unused
me
to
the
eccentricities
of
other
people
but
surely
this
little
redbeard
was
one
of
the
strangest
beings
one
would
be
likely
to
meet
bock
yowled
dismally
inside
and
i
did
not
feel
in
any
mood
to
sell
books
in
port
vigor
i
drove
back
into
the
town
and
stopped
at
a
tea
shop
for
a
pot
of
tea
and
some
toast
when
i
came
out
i
found
that
quite
a
little
crowd
had
collected
partly
owing
to
the
strange
appearance
of
parnassus
and
partly
because
of
bock
plaintive
cries
from
within
most
of
the
onlookers
seemed
to
suspect
the
outfit
of
being
part
of
a
travelling
menagerie
so
almost
against
my
will
i
put
up
the
flaps
tied
bock
to
the
tail
of
the
wagon
and
began
to
answer
the
humourous
questions
of
the
crowd
two
or
three
bought
books
without
any
urging
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
get
away
finally
i
shut
up
the
van
and
pulled
off
as
i
was
afraid
of
seeing
some
one
i
knew
as
i
turned
into
the
woodbridge
road
i
heard
the
whistle
of
the
five
train
to
new
york
the
twenty
miles
of
road
between
sabine
farm
and
port
vigor
was
all
familiar
to
me
but
now
to
my
relief
i
struck
into
a
region
that
i
had
never
visited
on
my
occasional
trips
to
boston
i
had
always
taken
the
train
at
port
vigor
so
the
country
roads
were
unknown
but
i
had
set
out
on
the
woodbridge
way
because
mifflin
had
spoken
of
a
farmer
pratt
who
lived
about
four
miles
out
of
port
vigor
on
the
woodbridge
road
apparently
pratt
had
several
times
bought
books
from
the
professor
and
the
latter
had
promised
to
visit
him
again
so
i
felt
in
duty
bound
to
oblige
a
good
customer
after
the
varied
adventures
of
the
last
two
days
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
be
alone
to
think
things
over
here
was
i
helen
mcgill
in
a
queer
case
indeed
instead
of
being
home
at
sabine
farm
getting
supper
i
was
trundling
along
a
strange
road
the
sole
owner
of
a
parnassus
probably
the
only
one
in
existence
a
horse
and
a
dog
and
a
cartload
of
books
on
my
hands
since
the
morning
of
the
day
before
my
whole
life
had
twisted
out
of
its
accustomed
orbit
i
had
spent
four
hundred
dollars
of
my
savings
i
had
sold
about
thirteen
dollars
worth
of
books
i
had
precipitated
a
fight
and
met
a
philosopher
not
only
that
i
was
dimly
beginning
to
evolve
a
new
philosophy
of
my
own
and
all
this
in
order
to
prevent
andrew
from
buying
a
lot
more
books
at
any
rate
i
had
been
successful
in
that
when
he
had
seen
parnassus
at
last
he
had
hardly
looked
at
her
except
in
tones
of
scorn
i
caught
myself
wondering
whether
the
professor
would
allude
to
the
incident
in
his
book
and
hoping
that
he
would
send
me
a
copy
but
after
all
why
should
he
mention
it
to
him
it
was
only
one
of
a
thousand
adventures
as
he
had
said
angrily
to
andrew
he
was
nothing
to
me
nor
i
to
him
how
could
he
realize
that
this
was
the
first
adventure
i
had
had
in
the
fifteen
years
i
had
been
what
was
it
he
called
it
compiling
my
anthology
well
the
funny
little
gingersnap
i
kept
bock
tied
to
the
back
of
the
van
as
i
was
afraid
he
might
take
a
notion
to
go
in
search
of
his
master
as
we
jogged
on
and
the
falling
sun
cast
a
level
light
across
the
way
i
got
a
bit
lonely
this
solitary
vagabonding
business
was
a
bit
sudden
after
fifteen
years
of
home
life
the
road
lay
close
to
the
water
and
i
watched
the
sound
grow
a
deeper
blue
and
then
a
dull
purple
i
could
hear
the
surf
pounding
and
on
the
end
of
long
island
a
lighthouse
showed
a
ruby
spark
i
thought
of
the
little
gingersnap
roaring
toward
new
york
on
the
express
and
wondered
whether
he
was
travelling
in
a
pullman
or
a
day
coach
a
pullman
chair
would
feel
easy
after
that
hard
parnassus
seat
by
and
by
we
neared
a
farmhouse
which
i
took
to
be
pratt
it
stood
close
to
the
road
with
a
big
red
barn
behind
and
a
gilt
weathervane
representing
a
galloping
horse
curiously
enough
peg
seemed
to
recognize
the
place
for
she
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
neighed
vigorously
it
must
have
been
a
favourite
stopping
place
for
the
professor
through
a
lighted
window
i
could
see
people
sitting
around
a
table
evidently
the
pratts
were
at
supper
i
drew
up
in
the
yard
some
one
looked
out
of
a
window
and
i
heard
a
girl
voice
why
pa
here
parnassus
gingersnap
must
have
been
a
welcome
visitor
at
that
farm
for
in
an
instant
the
whole
family
turned
out
with
a
great
scraping
of
chairs
and
clatter
of
dishes
a
tall
sunburnt
man
in
a
clean
shirt
with
no
collar
led
the
group
and
then
came
a
stout
woman
about
my
own
build
and
a
hired
man
and
three
children
good
evening
i
said
is
this
mr
pratt
sure
thing
said
he
where
the
perfessor
on
his
way
to
brooklyn
said
i
and
i
got
parnassus
he
told
me
to
be
sure
to
call
on
you
so
here
we
are
well
i
want
to
know
ejaculated
pratt
think
of
parnassus
turned
suffrage
ben
you
put
up
the
critters
and
i
take
mifflin
in
to
supper
hold
on
there
i
said
my
name
mcgill
miss
mcgill
see
it
painted
on
the
wagon
i
bought
the
outfit
from
mifflin
a
business
proposition
entirely
well
well
said
pratt
we
glad
to
see
any
friend
of
the
perfessor
sorry
he
not
here
too
come
right
in
and
have
a
bite
with
us
they
were
certainly
folk
and
ben
pratt
he
put
peg
and
bock
away
in
the
barn
and
gave
them
their
supper
while
pratt
took
me
up
to
her
spare
bedroom
and
brought
me
a
jug
of
hot
water
then
they
all
trooped
back
into
the
and
the
meal
began
again
i
am
a
connoisseur
of
farm
cooking
i
guess
and
i
got
to
hand
it
to
beulah
pratt
that
she
was
an
housewife
her
hot
biscuit
was
perfect
the
coffee
was
real
mocha
simmered
not
boiled
the
cold
sausage
and
potato
salad
was
as
good
as
any
andrew
ever
got
and
she
had
a
omelet
sent
in
for
me
and
opened
a
pot
of
her
own
strawberry
preserve
the
children
two
boys
and
a
girl
sat
nudging
one
another
and
pratt
got
out
his
pipe
while
i
finished
up
on
stewed
pears
and
cream
and
chocolate
cake
it
was
a
regular
meal
i
wondered
what
andrew
was
eating
and
whether
he
had
found
the
nest
behind

red
hen
always
drops
her
eggs

perfessor

time

guess

so
much
to
tell
i
said
he
stopped
up
at
our
place
the
other
day
and
said
he
wanted
to
sell
his
outfit
so
i
bought

pining
to

back
to
brooklyn
and

a
book

ever
started
it
yet
whereabout
do
you
come
from
miss
mcgill
said
pratt
i
could
see
he
was
mighty
puzzled
at
a
woman
driving
a
vanload
of
books
around
the
country
alone
over
toward
redfield
i
said
you
any
kin
to
that
writer
that
lives
up
that
way
you
mean
andrew
mcgill
i
said
he
my
brother
do
tell
exclaimed
pratt
why
the
perfessor
thought
a
terrible
lot
of
him
he
read
us
all
to
sleep
with
one
of
his
books
one
night
said
he
was
the
best
literature
in
this
state
i
do
believe
i
smiled
to
myself
as
i
thought
of
the
on
the
road
from
shelby
well
said
pratt
if
the
perfessor
got
any
better
friends
than
us
in
these
parts
i
glad
to
meet
he
come
here
first
time
four
years
ago
i
was
up
working
in
the
hayfield
that
afternoon
and
i
heard
a
shout
down
by
the
mill
pond
i
looked
over
that
way
and
saw
a
couple
o
kids
waving
their
arms
and
screamin
i
ran
down
the
hill
and
there
was
the
perfessor
just
a
pullin
my
boy
dick
out
o
the
water
dick
this
one
over
here
dick
a
small
boy
of
thirteen
or
so
grew
red
under
his
freckles
the
kids
had
been
foolin
around
on
a
raft
there
an
first
thing
you
know
dick
fell
in
right
into
deep
water
over
by
the
dam
could
swim
a
stroke
neither
and
the
perfessor
who
jest
happened
to
be
comin
along
in
that
of
his
heard
the
boys
yell
did
he
hop
out
o
the
wagon
as
spry
as
a
chimpanzee
skin
over
the
fence
an
jump
into
the
pond
swim
out
there
an
tow
the
boy
in
yes
he
saved
that
boy
life
then
an
no
mistake
that
man
can
read
me
to
sleep
with
poetry
any
night
he
has
a
mind
to
he
a
plumb
fine
little
firecracker
the
perfessor
farmer
pratt
pulled
hard
on
his
pipe
evidently
his
friendship
for
the
wandering
bookseller
was
one
of
the
realities
of
his
life
yes
he
went
on
that
perfessor
has
been
a
good
friend
to
me
sure
enough
we
brought
him
an
the
boy
back
to
the
house
the
boy
had
gone
down
three
times
an
the
perfessor
had
to
dive
to
find
him
they
were
both
purty
well
all
in
an
i
tell
you
i
was
scared
but
we
got
dick
around
somehow
rolled
him
on
a
sugar
poured
whiskey
in
him
an
worked
his
arms
an
put
him
in
hot
blankets
by
and
by
he
come
to
an
then
i
found
that
the
perfessor
gettin
over
the
fence
so
quick
when
he
lit
for
the
pond
had
torn
a
hole
in
his
leg
you
could
put
four
fingers
in
there
was
his
trouser
all
stiff
with
blood
an
he
not
sayin
a
thing
pluckiest
little
runt
in
three
states
by
judas
well
we
put
to
bed
too
and
then
the
missus
keeled
over
an
we
put
to
bed
three
of
them
by
time
the
doc
got
here
great
old
summer
afternoon
that
was
but
bless
your
heart
we
could
keep
the
perfessor
abed
long
next
day
he
was
out
lookin
fer
his
poetry
books
an
first
thing
you
know
he
had
us
all
rounded
up
an
was
preachin
good
literature
at
us
like
any
evangelist
i
guess
we
all
fell
asleep
over
his
poetry
so
then
he
started
on
readin
that
island
story
to
us
was
it
mother
by
hickory
we
none
of
us
fell
asleep
over
that
he
started
the
kids
readin
so
they
been
at
it
ever
since
and
dick
top
boy
at
school
now
teacher
says
she
never
saw
such
a
boy
for
readin
that
what
perfessor
done
for
us
well
tell
us
yerself
miss
mcgill
is
there
any
good
books
we
ought
to
read
i
used
to
pine
for
some
that
feller
shakespeare
my
father
used
to
talk
about
so
much
but
perfessor
always
it
was
over
my
head
it
gave
me
quite
a
thrill
to
hear
all
this
about
mifflin
i
could
readily
imagine
the
masterful
little
man
captivating
the
pratts
with
his
eloquence
and
earnestness
and
the
story
of
the
mill
pond
had
its
meaning
too
little
redbeard
was
no
mere
wandering
crank
he
was
a
real
man
cool
and
steady
of
brain
with
the
earmarks
of
a
hero
i
felt
a
sudden
gush
of
warmth
as
i
recalled
his
comical
ways
pratt
lit
a
fire
in
her
franklin
stove
and
i
racked
my
head
wondering
how
i
could
tread
worthily
in
the
professor
footsteps
finally
i
fetched
the
jungle
book
from
parnassus
and
read
them
the
story
of
there
was
a
long
pause
when
i
had
finished
say
pa
said
dick
shyly
that
mongoose
was
rather
like
professor
was
he
plainly
the
professor
was
the
traditional
hero
of
this
family
and
i
began
to
feel
rather
like
an
impostor
i
suppose
it
was
foolish
of
me
but
i
had
already
made
up
my
mind
to
push
on
to
woodbridge
that
night
it
could
not
be
more
than
four
miles
and
the
time
was
not
much
after
eight
i
felt
a
little
twinge
of
quite
unworthy
annoyance
because
i
was
still
treading
in
the
glamour
of
the
professor
influence
the
pratts
would
talk
of
nothing
else
and
i
wanted
to
get
somewhere
where
i
would
be
estimated
at
my
own
value
not
merely
as
his
disciple
darn
the
redbeard
i
said
to
myself
i
think
he
has
bewitched
these
people
and
in
spite
of
their
protests
and
invitations
to
stay
the
night
i
insisted
on
having
peg
hitched
up
i
gave
them
the
copy
of
the
jungle
book
as
a
small
return
for
their
hospitality
and
finally
sold
pratt
a
little
copy
of
lamb
tales
from
shakespeare
which
i
thought
he
could
read
without
brain
fever
then
i
lit
my
lantern
and
after
a
chorus
of
parnassus
rolled
away
well
i
said
to
myself
as
i
turned
into
the
high
road
once
more
drat
the
gingersnap
he
seems
to
hypnotize
everybody
he
must
be
nearly
in
brooklyn
by
this
time
it
was
very
quiet
along
the
road
also
very
dark
for
the
sky
had
clouded
over
and
i
could
see
neither
moon
nor
stars
as
it
was
a
direct
road
i
should
have
had
no
difficulty
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
fallen
into
a
doze
during
which
peg
took
a
wrong
turning
at
any
rate
i
realized
about
nine
that
parnassus
was
on
a
much
rougher
road
than
the
highway
had
any
right
to
be
and
there
were
no
telephone
poles
to
be
seen
i
knew
that
they
stretched
all
along
the
main
road
so
plainly
i
had
made
a
mistake
i
was
reluctant
for
a
moment
to
admit
that
i
could
be
wrong
and
just
then
peg
stumbled
heavily
and
stood
still
she
paid
no
heed
to
my
exhortations
and
when
i
got
out
and
carried
my
lantern
to
see
whether
anything
was
in
the
way
i
found
that
she
had
cast
a
shoe
and
her
foot
was
bleeding
the
shoe
must
have
dropped
off
some
way
back
and
she
had
picked
up
a
nail
or
something
in
the
quick
i
saw
no
alternative
but
to
stay
where
i
was
for
the
night
this
was
not
very
pleasant
but
the
adventures
of
the
day
had
put
me
into
a
stoical
frame
of
mind
and
i
saw
no
good
in
repining
i
unhitched
peg
sponged
her
foot
and
tied
her
to
a
tree
i
would
have
made
more
careful
explorations
to
determine
just
where
i
was
but
a
sharp
patter
of
rain
began
to
fall
so
i
climbed
into
my
parnassus
took
bock
in
with
me
and
lit
the
swinging
lamp
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
ten
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
turn
in
so
i
took
off
my
boots
and
lay
down
in
the
bunk
bock
lay
quite
comfortably
on
the
floor
of
the
van
i
meant
to
read
for
a
while
and
so
did
not
turn
out
the
light
but
i
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
i
woke
up
at
eleven
and
turned
out
the
lamp
which
had
made
the
van
very
warm
i
opened
the
little
windows
front
and
back
and
would
have
opened
the
door
but
i
feared
bock
might
slip
away
it
was
still
raining
a
little
to
my
annoyance
i
felt
very
wakeful
i
lay
for
some
time
listening
to
the
patter
of
raindrops
on
the
roof
and
skylight
a
very
snug
sound
when
one
is
warm
and
safe
every
now
and
then
i
could
hear
peg
stamping
in
the
underbrush
i
was
almost
dozing
off
again
when
bock
gave
a
low
growl
no
woman
of
my
bulk
has
a
right
to
be
nervous
i
guess
but
instantly
my
security
vanished
the
patter
of
the
rain
seemed
menacing
and
i
imagined
a
hundred
horrors
i
was
totally
alone
and
unarmed
and
bock
was
not
a
large
dog
he
growled
again
and
i
felt
worse
than
before
i
imagined
that
i
heard
stealthy
sounds
in
the
bushes
and
once
peg
snorted
as
though
frightened
i
put
my
hand
down
to
pat
bock
and
found
that
his
neck
was
all
bristly
like
a
fighting
cock
he
uttered
a
queer
half
growl
half
whine
which
gave
me
a
chill
some
one
must
be
prowling
about
the
van
but
in
the
falling
rain
i
could
hear
nothing
i
felt
i
must
do
something
i
was
afraid
to
call
out
lest
i
betray
the
fact
that
there
was
only
a
woman
in
the
van
my
expedient
was
absurd
enough
but
at
any
rate
it
satisfied
my
desire
to
act
i
seized
one
of
my
boots
and
banged
vigorously
on
the
floor
at
the
same
time
growling
in
as
deep
and
masculine
a
voice
as
i
could
muster
what
the
hell
the
matter
what
the
hell
the
matter
this
sounds
silly
enough
i
dare
say
but
it
afforded
me
some
relief
and
as
bock
shortly
ceased
growling
it
apparently
served
some
purpose
i
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
tingling
all
over
with
nervousness
then
i
began
to
grow
calmer
and
was
getting
drowsy
almost
in
spite
of
myself
when
i
was
aroused
by
the
unmistakable
sound
of
tail
thumping
on
the
floor
a
sure
sign
of
pleasure
this
puzzled
me
quite
as
much
as
his
growls
i
did
not
dare
strike
a
light
but
could
hear
him
sniffing
at
the
door
of
the
van
and
whining
with
eagerness
this
seemed
very
uncanny
and
again
i
crept
stealthily
out
of
the
bunk
and
pounded
on
the
floor
lustily
this
time
with
the
frying
pan
which
made
an
unearthly
din
peg
neighed
and
snorted
and
bock
began
to
bark
even
in
my
anxiety
i
almost
laughed
it
sounds
like
an
insane
asylum
i
thought
and
reflected
that
probably
the
disturbance
was
only
caused
by
some
small
animal
perhaps
a
rabbit
or
a
skunk
which
bock
had
winded
and
wanted
to
chase
i
patted
him
and
crawled
into
my
bunk
once
more
but
my
real
excitement
was
still
to
come
about
half
an
hour
later
i
heard
unmistakable
footsteps
alongside
the
van
bock
growled
furiously
and
i
lay
in
a
panic
something
jarred
one
of
the
wheels
then
broke
out
a
most
extraordinary
racket
i
heard
quick
steps
peg
whinneyed
and
something
fell
heavily
against
the
back
of
the
wagon
there
was
a
violent
scuffle
on
the
ground
the
sound
of
blows
and
rapid
breathing
with
my
heart
jumping
i
peered
out
of
one
of
the
back
windows
there
was
barely
any
light
but
dimly
i
could
see
a
tumbling
mass
which
squirmed
and
writhed
on
the
ground
something
struck
one
of
the
rear
wheels
so
that
parnassus
trembled
i
heard
hoarse
swearing
and
then
the
whole
body
whatever
it
was
rolled
off
into
the
underbrush
there
was
a
terrific
crashing
and
snapping
of
twigs
bock
whined
growled
and
pawed
madly
at
the
door
and
then
complete
silence
my
nerves
were
quite
shattered
by
this
time
i
do
think
i
had
been
so
frightened
since
childhood
days
when
i
awakened
from
a
nightmare
little
trickles
of
fear
crept
up
and
down
my
spine
and
my
scalp
prickled
i
pulled
bock
on
the
bunk
and
lay
with
one
hand
on
his
collar
he
too
seemed
agitated
and
sniffed
gingerly
now
and
then
finally
however
he
gave
a
sigh
and
fell
asleep
i
judged
it
might
have
been
two
but
i
did
not
like
to
strike
a
light
and
at
last
i
fell
into
a
doze
when
i
woke
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
chirping
of
birds
i
felt
stiff
and
uneasy
from
sleeping
in
my
clothes
and
my
foot
was
numb
from
bock
weight
i
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
parnassus
was
standing
in
a
narrow
lane
by
a
grove
of
birch
trees
the
ground
was
muddy
and
smeared
with
footprints
behind
the
van
i
opened
the
door
and
looked
around
the
first
thing
i
saw
on
the
ground
by
one
of
the
wheels
was
a
battered
tweed
cap
chapter
nine
my
feelings
were
as
mixed
as
a
crushed
nut
sundae
so
the
professor
had
gone
to
brooklyn
after
all
what
did
he
mean
by
prowling
after
me
like
a
sleuth
was
it
just
homesickness
for
parnassus
not
likely
and
then
the
horrible
noises
i
had
heard
in
the
night
had
some
tramp
been
hanging
about
the
van
in
the
hope
of
robbing
me
had
the
tramp
attacked
mifflin
or
had
mifflin
attacked
the
tramp
who
had
got
the
better
of
it
i
picked
up
the
muddy
cap
and
threw
it
into
the
van
anyway
i
had
problems
of
my
own
to
tackle
and
those
of
the
professor
could
wait
peg
whinneyed
when
she
saw
me
i
examined
her
foot
seeing
it
by
daylight
the
trouble
was
not
hard
to
diagnose
a
long
jagged
piece
of
slate
was
wedged
in
the
frog
of
the
foot
i
easily
wrenched
it
out
heated
some
water
and
gave
the
hoof
another
sponging
it
would
be
all
right
when
shod
once
more
but
where
was
the
shoe
i
gave
the
horse
some
oats
cooked
an
egg
and
a
cup
of
coffee
for
myself
at
the
little
kerosene
stove
and
broke
up
a
dog
biscuit
for
bock
i
marvelled
once
more
at
the
completeness
of
furnishings
bock
helped
me
to
scour
the
pan
he
sniffed
eagerly
at
the
cap
when
i
showed
it
to
him
and
wagged
his
tail
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
to
leave
parnassus
and
the
animals
where
they
were
and
retrace
my
steps
as
far
as
the
pratt
farm
undoubtedly
pratt
would
be
glad
to
sell
me
a
and
send
his
hired
man
to
do
the
job
for
me
i
could
not
drive
peg
as
she
was
with
a
sore
foot
and
without
a
shoe
i
judged
parnassus
would
be
quite
safe
the
lane
seemed
to
be
a
lonely
one
leading
to
a
deserted
quarry
i
tied
bock
to
the
steps
to
act
as
a
guard
took
my
purse
and
the
professor
cap
with
me
locked
the
door
of
the
van
and
set
off
along
the
back
track
bock
whined
and
tugged
violently
when
he
saw
me
disappearing
but
i
could
see
no
other
course
the
lane
rejoined
the
main
road
about
half
a
mile
back
i
must
have
been
asleep
or
i
could
never
have
made
the
mistake
of
turning
off
i
do
see
why
peg
should
have
made
the
turn
unless
her
foot
hurt
and
she
judged
the
side
track
would
be
a
good
place
to
rest
she
must
have
been
well
used
to
stopping
overnight
in
the
open
i
strode
along
pondering
over
my
adventures
and
resolved
to
buy
a
pistol
when
i
got
to
woodbridge
i
remember
thinking
that
i
could
write
quite
a
book
now
myself
already
i
began
to
feel
quite
a
hardened
pioneer
it
does
take
an
adaptable
person
long
to
accustom
one
self
to
a
new
way
of
life
and
the
humdrum
routine
of
the
farm
certainly
looked
prosy
compared
to
voyaging
with
parnassus
when
i
had
got
beyond
woodbridge
and
had
crossed
the
river
i
would
begin
to
sell
books
in
earnest
also
i
would
buy
a
notebook
and
jot
down
my
experiences
i
had
heard
of
bookselling
as
a
profession
for
women
but
i
thought
that
my
taste
of
it
was
probably
unique
i
might
even
write
a
book
that
would
rival
andrew
yes
and
mifflin
and
that
brought
my
thoughts
to
barbarossa
again
of
all
extraordinary
people
i
thought
he
certainly
takes
the
cake
and
then
rounding
a
bend
i
saw
him
sitting
on
a
rail
fence
with
his
head
shining
in
the
sunlight
my
heart
gave
a
sort
of
jump
i
do
believe
i
was
getting
fond
of
the
professor
he
was
examining
something
which
he
held
in
his
hand
you
get
sunstroke
i
said
here
your
cap
and
i
pulled
it
out
of
my
pocket
and
tossed
it
to
him
thanks
he
said
as
cool
as
you
please
and
here
your
fair
exchange
i
burst
out
laughing
and
he
looked
disconcerted
as
i
hoped
he
would
i
thought
you
be
in
brooklyn
by
now
i
said
at
abingdon
avenue
laying
out
chapter
one
what
do
you
mean
by
following
me
this
way
you
nearly
frightened
me
to
death
last
night
i
felt
like
one
of
fenimore
cooper
heroines
shut
up
in
the
blockhouse
while
the
redskins
prowled
about
he
flushed
and
looked
very
uncomfortable
i
owe
you
an
apology
he
said
i
certainly
never
intended
that
you
should
see
me
i
bought
a
ticket
for
new
york
and
checked
my
bag
through
and
then
while
i
was
waiting
for
the
train
it
came
over
me
that
your
brother
was
right
and
that
it
was
a
darned
risky
thing
for
you
to
go
jaunting
about
alone
in
parnassus
i
was
afraid
something
might
happen
i
followed
along
the
road
behind
you
keeping
well
out
of
sight
where
were
you
while
i
was
at
pratt
sitting
not
far
down
the
road
eating
bread
and
cheese
he
said
also
i
wrote
a
poem
a
thing
i
very
rarely
do
well
i
hope
your
ears
burned
i
said
for
those
pratts
have
certainly
raised
you
to
the
peerage
he
got
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
well
he
said
i
dare
say
it
was
all
an
error
but
anyway
i
follow
you
when
you
turned
off
into
that
lane
i
kept
pretty
close
behind
you
as
it
happens
i
know
this
bit
of
country
and
there
are
very
often
some
hoboes
hanging
around
the
old
quarry
up
that
lane
they
have
a
cave
there
where
they
go
into
winter
quarters
i
was
afraid
some
of
them
might
bother
you
you
could
hardly
have
chosen
a
worse
place
to
camp
out
by
the
bones
of
george
eliot
pratt
ought
to
have
warned
you
i
ca
conceive
why
you
did
stop
at
his
house
overnight
anyway
if
you
must
know
i
got
weary
of
hearing
them
sing
your
praises
i
could
see
that
he
was
beginning
to
get
nettled
i
regret
having
alarmed
you
he
said
i
see
that
peg
has
dropped
a
shoe
if
you
let
me
fix
it
for
you
after
that
i
wo
bother
you
we
turned
back
again
along
the
road
and
i
noticed
the
right
side
of
his
face
for
the
first
time
under
the
ear
was
a
large
livid
bruise
that
hobo
or
whoever
he
was
i
said
must
have
been
a
better
fighter
than
andrew
i
see
he
landed
on
your
cheek
are
you
always
fighting
his
annoyance
disappeared
apparently
the
professor
enjoyed
a
fight
almost
as
much
as
he
did
a
good
book
please
do
regard
the
last
hours
as
typical
of
me
he
said
with
a
chuckle
i
am
so
unused
to
being
a
squire
of
dames
that
perhaps
i
take
the
responsibilities
too
seriously
did
you
sleep
at
all
last
night
i
asked
i
think
i
began
to
realize
for
the
first
time
that
the
gallant
little
creature
had
been
out
all
night
in
a
drizzling
rain
simply
to
guard
me
from
possible
annoyance
and
i
had
been
unforgivably
churlish
about
it
i
found
a
very
fine
haystack
in
a
field
overlooking
the
quarry
i
crawled
into
the
middle
of
it
a
haystack
is
sometimes
more
comfortable
than
a
well
i
said
penitently
i
can
never
forgive
myself
for
the
trouble
i
caused
you
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
do
what
you
did
please
put
your
cap
on
and
do
catch
cold
we
walked
for
several
minutes
in
silence
i
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
was
afraid
he
might
have
caught
his
death
of
cold
from
being
out
all
night
in
the
wet
to
say
nothing
of
the
scuffle
he
had
had
with
the
tramp
but
he
really
looked
as
chipper
as
ever
how
do
you
like
the
wild
life
of
a
bookseller
he
said
you
must
read
george
borrow
he
would
have
enjoyed
parnassus
i
was
just
thinking
when
i
met
you
that
i
could
write
a
book
about
my
adventures
good
he
said
we
might
collaborate
there
another
thing
we
might
collaborate
on
i
said
and
that
breakfast
i
sure
you
have
had
any
no
he
said
i
do
think
i
have
i
never
lie
when
i
know
i
sha
be
believed
i
have
had
any
either
i
said
i
thought
that
to
tell
an
untruth
would
be
the
least
thing
i
could
do
to
reward
the
little
man
for
his
unselfishness
well
he
said
i
really
thought
that
by
this
time
he
broke
off
was
that
bock
barking
he
asked
sharply
we
had
been
walking
slowly
and
had
not
yet
reached
the
spot
where
the
lane
branched
from
the
main
road
we
were
still
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
place
where
i
had
camped
overnight
we
both
listened
carefully
but
i
could
hear
nothing
but
the
singing
of
the
telephone
wires
along
the
road
no
matter
he
said
i
thought
i
heard
a
dog
but
i
noticed
that
he
quickened
his
pace
i
was
saying
he
continued
that
i
had
really
thought
to
have
lost
parnassus
for
good
by
this
morning
but
i
tickled
to
death
to
have
a
chance
to
see
her
again
i
hope
she
be
as
good
a
friend
to
you
as
she
has
been
to
me
i
suppose
you
sell
her
when
you
return
to
the
sage
i
do
know
i
sure
i
said
i
must
confess
i
still
a
little
at
sea
my
desire
for
an
adventure
seems
to
have
let
me
in
deeper
than
i
expected
i
begin
to
see
that
there
more
in
this
bookselling
game
than
i
thought
honestly
it
getting
into
my
blood
well
that
fine
he
said
heartily
i
could
have
left
parnassus
in
better
hands
you
must
let
me
know
what
you
do
with
her
and
then
perhaps
when
i
finished
my
book
i
can
buy
her
back
we
struck
off
into
the
lane
the
ground
was
slippery
under
the
trees
and
we
went
single
file
mifflin
in
front
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
nine
just
an
hour
since
i
had
left
the
van
as
we
neared
the
spot
mifflin
kept
looking
ahead
through
the
birch
trees
in
a
queer
way
what
the
matter
i
said
we
almost
there
are
we
we
there
he
said
here
the
place
parnassus
was
gone
chapter
ten
we
stood
in
complete
dismay
i
did
at
any
rate
for
about
as
long
as
it
takes
to
peel
a
potato
there
could
be
no
doubt
in
which
direction
the
van
had
moved
for
the
track
of
the
wheels
was
plain
it
had
gone
farther
up
the
lane
toward
the
quarry
in
the
earth
which
was
still
soggy
were
a
number
of
footprints
by
the
bones
of
polycarp
exclaimed
the
professor
those
hoboes
have
stolen
the
van
i
guess
they
think
it
make
a
fine
pullman
sleeper
for
them
if
i
realized
there
was
more
than
one
of
them
i
have
hung
around
closer
they
need
a
lesson
good
lord
i
thought
here
don
quixote
about
to
wade
into
another
fight
had
we
better
go
back
and
get
mr
pratt
i
asked
this
was
obviously
the
wrong
thing
to
say
it
put
the
fiery
little
man
all
the
more
on
his
mettle
his
beard
bristled
nothing
of
the
sort
he
said
those
fellows
are
cowards
and
vagabonds
anyway
they
ca
be
far
off
you
have
been
away
more
than
an
hour
have
you
if
they
done
anything
to
bock
by
the
bones
of
chaucer
harry
them
i
i
heard
him
bark
he
hurried
up
the
lane
and
i
followed
in
a
panicky
frame
of
mind
the
track
wound
along
a
hillside
between
a
high
bank
and
a
forest
of
birch
trees
i
think
the
distance
ca
have
been
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
anyway
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
road
made
a
sharp
twist
to
the
right
and
we
found
ourselves
looking
down
into
the
quarry
over
a
sheer
rocky
drop
of
a
hundred
feet
at
least
below
drawn
over
to
one
side
of
the
wall
of
rock
stood
parnassus
peg
was
between
the
shafts
bock
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
sitting
by
the
van
were
three
disreputable
looking
men
the
smoke
of
a
cooking
fire
rose
into
the
air
evidently
they
were
making
free
with
my
little
larder
keep
back
said
the
professor
softly
do
let
them
see
us
he
flattened
himself
in
the
grass
and
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
i
did
the
same
and
we
lay
there
invisible
from
below
but
quite
able
to
see
everything
in
the
quarry
the
three
tramps
were
evidently
enjoying
an
excellent
breakfast
this
place
is
a
regular
for
these
fellows
mifflin
whispered
i
seen
hoboes
about
here
every
year
they
go
into
winter
quarters
about
the
end
of
october
usually
there
an
old
section
of
this
quarry
that
makes
a
sheltered
dormitory
for
them
and
as
the
place
is
worked
any
more
they
not
disturbed
here
so
long
as
they
do
make
mischief
in
the
neighbourhood
we
give
them
hands
up
said
a
rough
voice
behind
us
i
looked
round
there
was
a
fat
creature
covering
us
with
a
shiny
revolver
it
was
an
awkward
situation
both
the
professor
and
i
were
lying
full
length
on
the
ground
we
were
quite
helpless
get
up
said
the
tramp
in
a
husky
nasty
voice
i
guess
youse
thought
we
was
covering
our
trail
well
we
have
to
tie
you
up
i
reckon
while
we
get
away
with
this
crystal
pallis
of
yourn
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
but
to
my
surprise
the
professor
continued
to
lie
at
full
length
get
up
deacon
said
the
tramp
again
get
up
on
them
graceful
limbs
you
please
i
guess
he
thought
himself
safe
from
attack
by
a
woman
at
any
rate
he
bent
over
as
if
to
grab
mifflin
by
the
neck
i
saw
my
chance
and
jumped
on
him
from
behind
i
am
heavy
as
i
have
said
and
he
sprawled
on
the
ground
my
doubts
as
to
the
pistol
being
loaded
were
promptly
dissolved
for
it
went
off
like
a
cannon
nobody
was
in
front
of
it
however
and
mifflin
was
on
his
feet
like
a
flash
he
had
the
ruffian
by
the
throat
and
kicked
the
weapon
out
of
his
hand
i
ran
to
seize
it
you
son
of
satan
said
the
valiant
redbeard
thought
you
could
bully
us
did
you
miss
mcgill
you
were
as
quick
as
joan
of
arc
hand
me
the
pistol
please
i
gave
it
to
him
and
he
shoved
it
under
the
hobo
nose
now
he
said
take
off
that
rag
around
your
neck
the
rag
was
an
old
red
handkerchief
inconceivably
soiled
the
tramp
removed
it
grumbling
and
whining
mifflin
gave
me
the
pistol
to
hold
while
he
tied
our
prisoner
wrists
together
in
the
meantime
we
heard
a
shout
from
the
quarry
the
three
vagabonds
were
gazing
up
in
great
excitement
you
tell
those
fashion
plates
down
there
said
mifflin
as
he
knotted
the
tramp
hands
together
that
if
they
make
any
fight
i
shoot
them
like
crows
his
voice
was
cold
and
savage
and
he
seemed
quite
master
of
the
situation
but
i
must
confess
i
wondered
how
we
could
handle
four
of
them
the
greasy
ruffian
shouted
down
to
his
pals
in
the
quarry
but
i
did
not
hear
what
he
said
as
just
then
the
professor
asked
me
to
keep
our
captive
covered
while
he
got
a
stick
i
stood
with
the
pistol
pointed
at
his
head
while
mifflin
ran
back
into
the
birchwood
to
cut
a
cudgel
the
tramp
face
became
the
colour
of
the
under
side
of
a
fried
egg
as
he
looked
into
the
muzzle
of
his
own
gun
say
lady
he
pleaded
that
gun
goes
off
awful
easy
point
her
somewhere
else
or
you
croak
me
by
mistake
i
thought
a
good
scare
would
do
him
any
harm
and
kept
the
barrel
steadily
on
him
the
rascals
down
below
seemed
debating
what
to
do
i
do
know
whether
they
were
armed
or
not
but
probably
they
imagined
that
there
were
more
than
two
of
us
at
all
events
by
the
time
mifflin
came
back
with
a
stout
birch
staff
they
were
hustling
out
of
the
quarry
on
the
lower
side
the
professor
swore
and
looked
as
if
he
would
gladly
give
chase
but
he
refrained
here
you
he
said
in
crisp
tones
to
the
tramp
march
on
ahead
of
us
down
to
the
quarry
the
fat
ruffian
shambled
awkwardly
down
the
trail
we
had
to
make
quite
a
detour
to
get
into
the
quarry
and
by
the
time
we
reached
there
the
other
three
tramps
had
got
clean
away
i
was
not
sorry
to
tell
the
truth
i
thought
the
professor
had
had
enough
scrapping
for
one
hours
peg
whinneyed
loudly
as
she
saw
us
coming
but
bock
was
not
in
sight
what
have
you
done
with
the
dog
you
swine
said
mifflin
if
you
hurt
him
i
make
you
pay
with
your
own
hide
our
prisoner
was
completely
cowed
no
boss
we
ai
hurt
the
dog
he
fawned
we
tied
him
up
so
he
could
bark
that
all
he
in
the
and
sure
enough
by
this
time
we
could
hear
smothered
yelping
and
whining
from
parnassus
i
hurried
to
open
the
door
and
there
was
bock
his
jaws
tied
together
with
a
he
bounded
out
and
made
efforts
to
express
his
joy
at
seeing
the
professor
again
he
paid
very
little
attention
to
me
well
said
mifflin
after
freeing
the
dog
muzzle
and
with
difficulty
restraining
him
from
burying
his
teeth
in
the
shin
what
shall
we
do
with
this
heroic
specimen
of
manhood
shall
we
cart
him
over
to
the
jail
in
port
vigor
or
shall
we
let
him
go
the
tramp
burst
into
a
whining
appeal
that
was
almost
funny
it
was
so
abject
the
professor
cut
it
short
i
ought
to
pack
you
into
quod
he
said
are
you
the
phoebus
apollo
i
scuffled
with
down
the
lane
last
night
was
it
you
skulking
around
this
wagon
then
no
boss
that
was
splitlip
sam
honest
to
gawd
it
was
he
come
back
boss
said
he
been
fightin
with
a
say
boss
you
sure
hit
him
hard
one
of
his
lamps
is
a
pudding
boss
i
swear
i
ai
had
nothin
to
do
with
it
i
do
like
your
society
said
the
professor
and
i
going
to
turn
you
loose
i
going
to
count
ten
and
if
you
not
out
of
this
quarry
by
then
i
shoot
and
if
i
see
you
again
i
skin
you
alive
now
get
out
he
cut
the
knotted
handkerchief
in
two
the
hobo
needed
no
urging
he
spun
on
his
heel
and
fled
like
a
rabbit
the
professor
watched
him
go
and
as
the
fat
ungainly
figure
burst
through
a
hedge
and
disappeared
he
fired
the
revolver
into
the
air
to
frighten
him
still
more
then
he
tossed
the
weapon
into
the
pool
near
by
well
miss
mcgill
he
said
with
a
chuckle
if
you
like
to
undertake
breakfast
i
fix
up
peg
and
he
drew
the
from
his
pocket
once
more
a
brief
inspection
of
parnassus
satisfied
me
that
the
thieves
had
not
had
time
to
do
any
real
damage
they
had
got
out
most
of
the
eatables
and
spread
them
on
a
flat
rock
in
preparation
for
a
feast
and
they
had
tracked
a
good
deal
of
mud
into
the
van
but
otherwise
i
could
see
nothing
amiss
so
while
mifflin
busied
himself
with
peg
foot
it
was
easy
for
me
to
get
a
meal
under
way
i
found
a
gush
of
clean
water
trickling
down
the
face
of
the
rock
there
were
still
some
eggs
and
bread
and
cheese
in
the
little
cupboard
and
an
unopened
tin
of
condensed
milk
i
gave
peg
her
nose
bag
of
oats
and
fed
bock
who
was
frisking
about
in
high
spirits
by
that
time
the
shoeing
was
done
and
the
professor
and
i
sat
down
to
an
improvised
meal
i
was
beginning
to
feel
as
if
this
gipsy
existence
were
the
normal
course
of
my
life
well
professor
i
said
as
i
handed
him
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
plate
of
scrambled
eggs
and
cheese
for
a
man
who
slept
in
a
wet
haystack
you
acquit
yourself
with
excellent
valour
old
parnassus
is
quite
a
stormy
petrel
he
said
i
used
to
think
the
chief
difficulty
in
writing
a
book
would
be
to
invent
things
to
happen
but
if
i
were
to
sit
down
and
write
the
adventures
i
had
with
her
it
would
be
a
regular
odyssey
how
about
peg
foot
i
asked
can
she
travel
on
it
it
be
all
right
if
you
go
easy
i
scraped
out
the
injured
part
and
put
the
shoe
back
i
keep
a
little
kit
of
tools
under
the
van
for
emergencies
of
all
sorts
it
was
chilly
and
we
did
dawdle
over
our
meal
i
only
made
a
feint
of
eating
as
i
had
had
a
little
breakfast
before
and
also
as
the
events
of
the
last
few
hours
had
left
me
rather
restless
i
wanted
to
get
parnassus
out
on
the
highway
again
to
jog
along
in
the
sun
and
think
things
over
the
quarry
was
a
desolate
forbidding
place
anyway
but
before
we
left
we
explored
the
cave
where
the
tramps
had
been
preparing
to
make
themselves
comfortable
for
the
winter
it
was
not
really
a
cave
but
only
a
shaft
into
the
granite
cliff
a
screen
of
evergreen
boughs
protected
the
opening
against
the
weather
and
inside
were
piles
of
sacking
that
had
evidently
been
used
as
beds
and
many
old
grocery
boxes
for
tables
and
chairs
it
amused
me
to
notice
a
cracked
fragment
of
mirror
balanced
on
a
corner
of
rock
even
these
ragamuffins
apparently
were
not
totally
unconscious
of
personal
appearance
i
seized
the
opportunity
while
the
professor
was
giving
peg
foot
a
final
look
to
rearrange
my
hair
which
was
emphatically
a
sight
i
hardly
think
andrew
would
have
recognized
me
that
morning
we
led
peg
up
the
steep
incline
back
into
the
lane
where
i
had
strayed
and
at
length
we
reached
the
main
road
again
here
i
began
to
lay
down
the
law
to
redbeard
now
look
here
professor
i
said
i
not
going
to
have
you
tramp
all
the
way
back
to
port
vigor
after
the
night
you
had
you
need
a
rest
you
just
climb
into
that
parnassus
and
lie
down
for
a
good
snooze
i
drive
you
into
woodbridge
and
you
can
take
your
train
there
now
you
get
right
into
that
bunk
i
sit
out
here
and
drive
he
demurred
but
without
much
emphasis
i
think
the
little
fool
was
just
about
fagged
out
and
no
wonder
i
was
a
trifle
groggy
myself
in
the
end
he
was
quite
docile
he
climbed
into
the
van
took
off
his
boots
and
lay
down
under
a
blanket
bock
followed
him
and
i
think
they
both
fell
asleep
on
the
instant
i
got
on
the
front
seat
and
took
the
reins
i
did
let
peg
go
more
quickly
than
a
walk
as
i
wanted
to
spare
her
sore
foot
my
what
a
morning
that
was
after
the
rain
the
road
ran
pretty
close
to
the
shore
and
every
now
and
then
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
water
the
air
was
keen
not
just
the
ordinary
unnoticed
air
that
we
breathe
in
and
out
and
do
think
about
but
a
sharp
and
tingling
essence
as
strong
in
the
nostrils
as
camphor
or
ammonia
the
sun
seemed
focussed
upon
parnassus
and
we
moved
along
the
white
road
in
a
flush
of
golden
light
the
flat
fronds
of
the
cedars
swayed
gently
in
the
salty
air
and
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
i
should
think
i
began
amusing
myself
by
selecting
words
to
describe
the
goodness
of
the
morning
i
even
imagined
myself
writing
a
description
of
it
as
if
i
were
andrew
or
thoreau
the
crazy
little
professor
had
inoculated
me
with
his
literary
bug
i
guess
and
then
i
did
a
dishonourable
thing
just
by
chance
i
put
my
hand
into
the
little
pocket
beside
the
seat
where
mifflin
kept
a
few
odds
and
ends
i
meant
to
have
another
look
at
that
card
of
his
with
the
poem
on
it
and
there
i
found
a
funny
battered
little
notebook
evidently
forgotten
on
the
cover
was
written
in
ink
thoughts
on
the
present
discontents
that
title
seemed
vaguely
familiar
i
seemed
to
recall
something
of
the
kind
from
my
school
days
more
than
twenty
years
ago
goodness
me
of
course
if
i
had
been
honourable
i
would
have
looked
into
it
but
in
a
kind
of
quibbling
i
recalled
that
i
had
bought
parnassus
and
all
it
contained
lock
stock
barrel
and
bung
as
andrew
used
to
say
and
so
the
notebook
was
full
of
little
jottings
written
in
pencil
in
the
professor
small
precise
hand
the
words
were
rubbed
and
soiled
but
plainly
legible
i
read
this
i
do
suppose
bock
or
peg
get
lonely
but
by
the
bones
of
ben
gunn
i
do
seems
silly
when
herrick
and
hans
andersen
and
tennyson
and
thoreau
and
a
whole
wagonload
of
other
good
fellows
are
riding
at
my
back
i
can
hear
them
all
talking
as
we
trundle
along
but
books
are
a
world
after
all
and
every
now
and
then
we
get
hungry
for
some
closer
more
human
relationships
i
been
totally
alone
now
for
eight
years
except
for
runt
and
he
might
be
dead
and
never
say
so
this
wandering
about
is
fine
in
its
way
but
it
must
come
to
an
end
some
day
a
man
needs
to
put
down
a
root
somewhere
to
be
really
happy
what
absurd
victims
of
contrary
desires
we
are
if
a
man
is
settled
in
one
place
he
yearns
to
wander
when
he
wanders
he
yearns
to
have
a
home
and
yet
how
bestial
is
content
all
the
great
things
in
life
are
done
by
discontented
people
there
are
three
ingredients
in
the
good
life
learning
earning
and
yearning
a
man
should
be
learning
as
he
goes
and
he
should
be
earning
bread
for
himself
and
others
and
he
should
be
yearning
too
yearning
to
know
the
unknowable
what
a
fine
old
poem
is
the
pulley
by
george
herbert
those
elizabethan
fellows
knew
how
to
write
they
were
marred
perhaps
by
their
idea
that
poems
must
be
witty
remember
how
bacon
said
that
reading
poets
makes
one
witty
there
he
gave
a
clue
to
the
literature
of
his
time
their
fantastic
puns
and
conceits
are
rather
out
of
our
fashion
nowadays
but
lord
the
root
of
the
matter
was
in
them
how
gallantly
how
reverently
they
tackle
the
problems
of
life
when
god
at
first
made
man
says
george
herbert
he
had
a
glass
of
blessings
standing
by
so
he
pours
on
man
all
the
blessings
in
his
reservoir
strength
beauty
wisdom
honour
pleasure
and
then
he
refrains
from
giving
him
the
last
of
them
which
is
rest
contentment
god
sees
that
if
man
is
contented
he
will
never
win
his
way
to
him
let
man
be
restless
so
that
if
goodness
lead
him
not
yet
weariness
may
toss
him
to
my
breast
some
day
i
shall
write
a
novel
on
that
theme
and
call
it
the
pulley
in
this
tragic
restless
world
there
must
be
some
place
where
at
last
we
can
lay
our
heads
and
be
at
rest
some
people
call
it
death
some
call
it
god
my
ideal
of
a
man
is
not
the
omar
who
wants
to
shatter
into
bits
this
sorry
scheme
of
things
and
then
remould
it
nearer
to
the
heart
desire
old
omar
was
a
coward
with
his
silk
pajamas
and
his
glass
of
wine
the
real
man
is
george
herbert
seasoned
timber
the
fellow
who
does
handily
and
well
whatever
comes
to
him
even
if
it
only
shovelling
coal
into
a
furnace
he
can
balance
the
shovel
neatly
swing
the
coal
square
on
the
fire
and
not
spill
it
on
the
floor
if
it
only
splitting
kindling
or
running
a
trolley
car
he
can
make
a
good
artistic
job
of
it
if
it
only
writing
a
book
or
peeling
potatoes
he
can
put
into
it
the
best
he
has
even
if
only
a
old
fool
over
forty
selling
books
on
a
country
road
he
can
make
an
ideal
of
it
good
old
parnassus
it
a
great
game
i
think
i
have
to
give
her
up
soon
though
i
must
get
that
book
of
mine
written
but
parnassus
has
been
a
true
glass
of
blessings
to
me
there
was
much
more
in
the
notebook
indeed
it
was
half
full
of
jotted
paragraphs
memoranda
and
scraps
of
writing
poems
i
believe
some
of
them
were
but
i
had
seen
enough
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
stumbled
unawares
on
the
pathetic
brave
and
lonely
heart
of
the
little
man
i
a
commonplace
creature
i
afraid
insensible
to
many
of
the
deeper
things
in
life
but
every
now
and
then
like
all
of
us
i
come
face
to
face
with
something
that
thrills
me
i
saw
how
this
little
pedlar
was
like
a
cake
of
yeast
in
the
big
heavy
dough
of
humanity
how
he
travelled
about
trying
to
fulfil
in
his
own
way
his
ideals
of
beauty
i
felt
almost
motherly
toward
him
i
wanted
to
tell
him
that
i
understood
him
and
in
a
way
i
felt
ashamed
of
having
run
away
from
my
own
homely
tasks
my
kitchen
and
my
hen
yard
and
dear
old
andrew
i
fell
into
a
sober
mood
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
i
thought
i
would
sell
parnassus
and
hurry
back
to
the
farm
that
was
my
job
that
was
my
glass
of
blessings
what
was
i
doing
a
fat
woman
trapesing
along
the
roads
with
a
cartload
of
books
i
understand
i
slipped
the
little
notebook
back
into
its
i
would
have
died
rather
than
let
the
professor
know
i
had
seen
it
chapter
eleven
we
were
coming
into
woodbridge
and
i
was
just
wondering
whether
to
wake
the
professor
when
the
little
window
behind
me
slid
back
and
he
stuck
his
head
out
hello
he
said
i
think
i
must
have
been
asleep
well
i
should
hope
so
i
said
you
needed
it
indeed
he
looked
much
better
and
i
was
relieved
to
see
it
i
had
been
really
afraid
he
would
be
ill
after
sleeping
out
all
night
but
i
guess
he
was
tougher
than
i
thought
he
joined
me
on
the
seat
and
we
drove
into
the
town
while
he
went
to
the
station
to
ask
about
the
trains
i
had
a
fine
time
selling
books
i
was
away
from
the
locality
where
i
was
known
and
had
no
shyness
in
attempting
to
imitate
mifflin
methods
i
even
went
him
one
better
by
going
into
a
hardware
store
where
i
bought
a
large
dinner
bell
this
i
rang
lustily
until
a
crowd
gathered
then
i
put
up
the
flaps
and
displayed
my
books
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
sold
only
one
but
i
enjoyed
myself
none
the
less
by
and
by
mifflin
reappeared
i
think
he
had
been
to
a
barber
at
any
rate
he
looked
very
spry
he
had
bought
a
clean
collar
and
a
flowing
tie
of
a
bright
electric
blue
which
really
suited
him
rather
well
well
he
said
the
sage
is
going
to
get
back
at
me
for
that
punch
on
the
nose
i
been
to
the
bank
to
cash
your
check
they
telephoned
over
to
redfield
and
apparently
your
brother
has
stopped
payment
on
it
it
rather
awkward
they
seem
to
think
i
a
crook
i
was
furious
what
right
had
andrew
to
do
that
the
brute
i
said
what
on
earth
shall
i
do
i
suggest
that
you
telephone
to
the
redfield
bank
he
said
and
countermand
your
brother
instructions
that
is
unless
you
think
you
made
a
mistake
i
do
want
to
take
advantage
of
you
nonsense
i
said
i
not
going
to
let
andrew
spoil
my
holiday
that
always
his
way
if
he
gets
an
idea
into
his
head
he
like
a
mule
i
telephone
to
redfield
and
then
we
go
to
see
the
bank
here
we
put
parnassus
up
at
the
hotel
and
i
went
to
the
telephone
i
was
thoroughly
angry
at
andrew
and
tried
to
get
him
on
the
wire
first
but
sabine
farm
did
answer
then
i
telephoned
to
the
bank
in
redfield
and
got
shirley
he
the
cashier
and
i
know
him
well
i
guess
he
recognized
my
voice
for
he
made
no
objection
when
i
told
him
what
i
wanted
now
you
telephone
to
the
bank
in
woodbridge
i
said
and
tell
them
to
let
mifflin
have
the
money
i
go
there
with
him
to
identify
him
will
that
be
all
right
perfectly
he
said
the
deceitful
little
snail
if
i
had
only
known
what
he
was
concocting
mifflin
said
there
was
a
train
at
three
which
he
could
take
we
stopped
at
a
little
lunch
room
for
a
bite
to
eat
then
he
went
again
to
the
bank
and
i
with
him
we
asked
the
cashier
whether
they
had
had
a
message
from
redfield
yes
he
said
we
just
heard
and
he
looked
at
me
rather
queerly
are
you
miss
mcgill
he
said
i
am
i
said
will
you
just
step
this
way
a
moment
he
asked
politely
he
led
me
into
a
little
and
asked
me
to
sit
down
i
supposed
that
he
was
going
to
get
some
paper
for
me
to
sign
so
i
waited
quite
patiently
for
several
minutes
i
had
left
the
professor
at
the
cashier
window
where
they
would
give
him
his
money
i
waited
some
time
and
finally
i
got
tired
of
looking
at
the
life
insurance
calendars
then
i
happened
to
glance
out
of
the
window
surely
that
was
the
professor
just
disappearing
round
the
corner
with
another
man
i
returned
to
the
cashier
desk
what
the
matter
i
said
your
mahogany
furniture
is
charming
but
i
tired
of
it
do
i
have
to
sit
here
any
longer
and
mifflin
did
he
get
his
money
the
cashier
was
a
horrid
little
creature
with
side
whiskers
i
sorry
you
had
to
wait
madam
he
said
the
transaction
is
just
concluded
we
gave
mifflin
what
was
due
him
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
stay
longer
i
thought
this
was
very
extraordinary
surely
the
professor
would
not
leave
without
saying
however
i
noticed
that
the
clock
said
three
minutes
to
three
so
i
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
had
to
run
to
catch
his
train
he
was
such
a
strange
little
man
anyway
well
i
went
back
to
the
hotel
quite
a
little
upset
by
this
sudden
parting
at
least
i
was
glad
the
little
man
had
got
his
money
all
right
probably
he
would
write
from
brooklyn
but
of
course
i
would
get
the
letter
till
i
returned
to
the
farm
as
that
was
the
only
address
he
would
have
perhaps
that
would
be
so
long
after
all
but
i
did
not
feel
like
going
back
now
when
andrew
had
been
so
horrid
i
drove
parnassus
on
the
ferry
and
we
crossed
the
river
i
felt
lost
and
disagreeable
even
the
fresh
movement
through
the
air
gave
me
no
pleasure
bock
whined
dismally
inside
the
van
it
did
take
me
long
to
discover
that
parnassing
all
alone
had
lost
some
of
its
charms
i
missed
the
professor
missed
his
abrupt
direct
way
of
saying
things
and
his
whimsical
wit
and
i
was
annoyed
by
his
skipping
off
without
a
word
of
it
seem
natural
i
partially
appeased
my
irritation
by
stopping
at
a
farmhouse
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
selling
a
cook
book
then
i
started
along
the
road
for
bath
about
five
miles
farther
on
peg
foot
did
seem
to
bother
her
so
i
thought
it
would
be
safe
to
travel
that
far
before
stopping
for
the
night
counting
up
the
days
with
some
difficulty
it
seemed
as
though
i
had
been
away
from
home
a
month
i
remembered
that
this
was
saturday
night
i
thought
i
would
stay
in
bath
over
sunday
and
get
a
good
rest
we
jogged
sedately
along
the
road
and
i
got
out
a
copy
of
vanity
fair
i
was
so
absorbed
in
becky
sharp
that
i
would
even
interrupt
myself
to
sell
books
at
the
houses
we
passed
i
think
reading
a
good
book
makes
one
modest
when
you
see
the
marvellous
insight
into
human
nature
which
a
truly
great
book
shows
it
is
bound
to
make
you
feel
small
like
looking
at
the
dipper
on
a
clear
night
or
seeing
the
winter
sunrise
when
you
go
out
to
collect
the
morning
eggs
and
anything
that
makes
you
feel
small
is
mighty
good
for
you
what
do
you
mean
by
a
great
book
said
the
professor
i
mean
i
imagined
him
saying
it
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
could
see
him
sitting
there
with
his
corncob
pipe
in
his
hand
and
that
quizzical
little
face
of
his
looking
sharply
at
me
somehow
talking
with
the
professor
had
made
me
think
he
was
as
good
as
one
of
those
scranton
correspondence
courses
i
do
believe
and
no
money
to
pay
for
postage
well
i
said
to
the
professor
to
myself
i
mean
let
see
what
a
good
book
i
do
mean
books
like
henry
james
andrew
great
idol
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
a
kind
of
rush
of
words
to
the
head
and
never
stopped
to
sort
them
out
properly
a
good
book
ought
to
have
something
simple
about
it
and
like
eve
it
ought
to
come
from
somewhere
near
the
third
rib
there
ought
to
be
a
heart
beating
in
it
a
story
that
all
forehead
does
amount
to
much
anyway
it
never
get
over
at
a
dorcas
meeting
that
was
the
trouble
with
henry
james
andrew
talked
so
much
about
him
that
i
took
one
of
his
books
to
read
aloud
at
our
sewing
circle
over
at
redfield
well
after
one
try
we
had
to
fall
back
on
pollyanna
i
have
been
doing
chores
and
running
a
farmhouse
for
fifteen
years
without
getting
some
ideas
about
life
and
even
about
books
i
would
set
my
views
up
against
yours
professor
i
was
still
talking
to
mifflin
in
my
mind
no
nor
even
against
andrew
but
as
i
say
i
got
some
ideas
of
my
own
i
learned
that
honest
work
counts
in
writing
books
just
as
much
as
it
does
in
washing
dishes
i
guess
andrew
books
must
be
some
good
after
all
because
he
surely
does
mull
over
them
without
end
i
can
forgive
his
being
a
shiftless
farmer
so
long
as
he
really
does
his
literary
chores
up
to
the
hilt
a
man
can
be
slack
in
everything
else
if
he
does
one
thing
as
well
as
he
possibly
can
and
i
guess
it
matter
my
being
an
ignoramus
in
literature
so
long
as
i
rated
in
the
kitchen
that
what
i
used
to
think
as
i
polished
and
scoured
and
scrubbed
and
dusted
and
swept
and
then
set
about
getting
dinner
if
i
ever
sat
down
to
read
for
ten
minutes
the
cat
would
get
into
the
custard
no
woman
in
the
country
sits
down
for
fifteen
consecutive
minutes
between
sunrise
and
sunset
anyway
unless
she
has
half
a
dozen
servants
and
nobody
knows
anything
about
literature
unless
he
spends
most
of
his
life
sitting
down
so
there
you
are
the
cultivation
of
philosophic
reflection
was
a
new
experience
for
me
peg
ambled
along
contentedly
and
the
dog
trailed
under
parnassus
where
i
had
tied
him
i
read
vanity
fair
and
thought
about
all
sorts
of
things
once
i
got
out
to
pick
some
scarlet
maple
leaves
that
attracted
me
the
motors
passing
annoyed
me
with
their
dust
and
noise
but
by
and
by
one
of
them
stopped
looked
at
my
outfit
curiously
and
then
asked
to
see
some
books
i
put
up
the
flaps
for
them
and
we
pulled
off
to
one
side
of
the
road
and
had
a
good
talk
they
bought
two
or
three
books
too
by
the
time
i
neared
bath
the
hands
of
my
watch
pointed
to
supper
i
was
still
a
bit
shy
of
mifflin
scheme
of
stopping
overnight
at
farmhouses
so
i
thought
i
go
right
into
the
town
and
look
for
a
hotel
the
next
day
was
sunday
so
it
seemed
reasonable
to
give
the
horse
a
good
rest
and
stay
in
bath
two
nights
the
hominy
house
looked
clean
and
and
the
name
amused
me
so
in
i
went
it
was
a
kind
of
with
mostly
old
women
around
it
looked
to
me
almost
literary
and
elbert
hubbardish
compared
to
the
grand
central
in
shelby
the
folks
there
stared
at
me
somewhat
suspiciously
and
i
half
thought
they
were
going
to
say
they
did
take
pedlars
but
when
i
flashed
a
new
bill
at
the
desk
i
got
good
service
a
bill
is
a
patent
of
nobility
in
new
england
my
how
i
enjoyed
that
creamed
chicken
on
toast
and
buckwheat
cakes
with
syrup
after
you
get
used
to
cooking
all
your
own
grub
a
meal
off
some
one
else
stove
is
the
finest
kind
of
treat
after
supper
i
was
all
prepared
to
sit
out
on
the
porch
with
my
sweater
on
and
give
a
rocking
chair
a
hot
box
but
then
i
remembered
that
it
was
up
to
me
to
carry
on
the
traditions
of
parnassus
i
was
there
to
spread
the
gospel
of
good
books
i
got
to
thinking
how
the
professor
never
shirked
carrying
on
his
campaign
and
i
determined
that
i
would
be
worthy
of
the
cause
when
i
think
back
about
the
experience
it
seems
pretty
crazy
but
at
the
time
i
was
filled
with
a
kind
of
evangelistic
zeal
i
thought
if
i
was
going
to
try
to
sell
books
i
might
as
well
have
some
fun
out
of
it
most
of
the
old
ladies
were
squatting
about
in
the
parlour
knitting
or
reading
or
playing
cards
in
the
i
could
see
two
men
hominy
the
manager
of
the
place
was
sitting
at
her
desk
behind
a
brass
railing
going
over
accounts
with
a
quill
pen
i
thought
that
the
house
probably
had
had
a
shock
since
walt
whitman
wrote
leaves
of
grass
in
a
kind
of
spirit
i
determined
to
give
them
a
rouse
in
the
i
had
noticed
a
huge
dinner
bell
that
stood
behind
the
door
i
stepped
in
there
and
got
it
standing
in
the
big
hall
i
began
ringing
it
as
hard
as
i
could
shake
my
arm
you
might
have
thought
it
was
a
fire
alarm
hominy
dropped
her
pen
in
horror
the
colonial
dames
in
the
parlour
came
to
life
and
ran
into
the
hall
like
cockroaches
in
a
minute
i
had
gathered
quite
a
respectable
audience
it
was
up
to
me
to
do
the
spellbinding
friends
i
said
unconsciously
imitating
the
professor
tricks
of
the
trade
i
guess
this
bell
which
generally
summons
you
to
the
groaning
board
now
calls
you
to
a
literary
repast
with
the
permission
of
the
management
and
with
apologies
for
disturbing
your
tranquillity
i
will
deliver
a
few
remarks
on
the
value
of
good
books
i
see
that
several
of
you
are
fond
of
reading
so
perhaps
the
topic
will
be
congenial
they
gazed
at
me
about
as
warmly
as
a
round
of
walnut
sundaes
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
continued
of
course
you
remember
the
story
of
abe
lincoln
when
he
said
you
call
a
leg
a
tail
how
many
tails
has
a
dog
you
answer
wrong
because
as
lincoln
said
calling
a
leg
a
tail
i
still
think
it
was
a
good
beginning
but
that
was
as
far
as
i
got
hominy
came
out
of
her
trance
hastened
from
the
cage
and
grabbed
my
arm
she
was
quite
red
with
anger
really
she
said
well
really
i
must
ask
you
to
continue
this
in
some
other
place
we
do
not
allow
commercial
travellers
in
this
house
and
within
fifteen
minutes
they
had
hitched
up
peg
and
asked
me
to
move
on
indeed
i
was
so
taken
aback
by
my
own
zeal
that
i
could
hardly
protest
in
a
kind
of
daze
i
found
myself
at
the
moose
hotel
where
they
assured
me
that
they
catered
to
mercantile
people
i
went
straight
to
my
room
and
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
straw
mattress
that
was
my
first
and
only
public
speech
chapter
twelve
the
next
day
was
sunday
october
sixth
i
well
remember
the
date
i
woke
up
as
chipper
as
any
robert
chambers
heroine
all
my
doubts
and
depressions
of
the
evening
before
had
fled
and
i
was
delighted
with
the
world
and
everything
in
it
the
hotel
was
a
poor
place
but
it
would
have
taken
more
than
that
to
mar
my
composure
i
had
a
bitterly
cold
bath
in
a
real
country
tin
tub
and
then
eggs
and
pancakes
for
breakfast
at
the
table
was
a
drummer
who
sold
lightning
rods
and
several
other
travelling
salesmen
i
afraid
my
conversation
was
consciously
modelled
along
the
line
of
what
the
professor
would
have
said
if
he
had
been
there
but
at
any
rate
i
got
along
swimmingly
the
travelling
men
after
a
moment
or
two
of
embarrassed
diffidence
treated
me
quite
as
one
of
themselves
and
asked
me
about
my
line
with
interest
i
described
what
i
was
doing
and
they
all
said
they
envied
me
my
freedom
to
come
and
go
independently
of
trains
we
talked
cheerfully
for
a
long
time
and
almost
without
intending
to
i
started
preaching
about
books
in
the
end
they
insisted
on
my
showing
them
parnassus
we
all
went
out
to
the
stable
where
the
van
was
quartered
and
they
browsed
over
the
shelves
before
i
knew
it
i
had
sold
five
worth
although
i
had
decided
not
to
do
any
business
at
all
on
sunday
but
i
could
refuse
to
sell
them
the
stuff
as
they
all
seemed
so
keen
on
getting
something
really
good
to
read
one
man
kept
on
talking
about
harold
bell
wright
but
i
had
to
admit
that
i
had
heard
of
him
evidently
the
professor
had
stocked
any
of
his
works
i
was
tickled
to
see
that
after
all
little
redbeard
did
know
about
literature
after
that
i
debated
whether
to
go
to
church
or
to
write
letters
finally
i
decided
in
favour
of
the
letters
first
i
tackled
andrew
i
wrote
the
moose
hotel
bath
sunday
morning
dear
andrew
it
seems
absurd
to
think
that
it
only
three
days
since
i
left
sabine
farm
honestly
more
has
happened
to
me
in
these
three
days
than
in
three
years
at
home
i
sorry
that
you
and
mifflin
disagreed
but
i
quite
understood
your
feelings
but
i
very
angry
that
you
should
have
tried
to
stop
that
check
i
gave
him
it
was
none
of
your
business
andrew
i
telephoned
shirley
and
made
him
send
word
to
the
bank
in
woodbridge
to
give
mifflin
the
money
mifflin
did
not
swindle
me
into
buying
parnassus
i
did
it
of
my
own
free
will
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
it
was
your
fault
i
bought
it
because
i
was
scared
would
if
i
did
and
i
did
want
to
be
left
all
alone
on
the
farm
from
now
till
thanksgiving
while
you
went
off
on
another
trip
so
i
decided
to
do
the
thing
myself
i
thought
i
see
how
you
would
like
being
left
all
alone
to
run
the
house
i
thought
it
be
pretty
nice
for
me
to
get
things
off
my
mind
a
while
and
have
an
adventure
of
my
own
now
andrew
here
are
some
directions
for
you
do
forget
to
feed
the
chickens
twice
a
day
and
collect
the
eggs

nest
behind
the
wood
pile
and
some
of
the
wyandottes
have
been
laying
under
the
ice
house
do
let
rosie
touch
grandmother
blue
china
because
break
it
as
sure
as
fate
if
she
lays
her
big
thick
swedish
fingers
on
it
do
forget
your
warmer
underwear
the
nights

that
for

your
socks

needs
darning
over
to
mcnally

it
for
you
do
forget
to
feed
the
pigs
do
forget
to
mend
the
weathervane
on
the
barn
do
forget
to
send
that
barrel
of

when
decameron

up
to
see
us
later
in
the
fall
just
to
make
ten
commandments
i
add
one
more
you
might
to
collins
that
the
dorcas
will
have
to
meet
at
some
one
else
house
next
week
because
i
do
know
just
when
i
get
back
i
may
be
away
a
fortnight
more
this
is
my
first
holiday
in
a
long
time
and
i
going
to
chew
it
before
i
swallow
it
the
professor
mifflin
i
mean
has
gone
back
to
brooklyn
to
work
on
his
book
i
sorry
you
and
he
had
to
mix
it
up
on
the
high
road
like
a
couple
of
hooligans
he
a
nice
little
man
and
like
him
if
you
got
to
know
him
i
spending
sunday
in
bath
i
going
on
toward
hastings
i
sold
five
dollars
worth
of
books
this
morning
even
if
it
is
sunday
your
affte
sister
helen
mcgill
do
forget
to
clean
the
separator
after
using
it
or
get
in
a
fearful
state
after
writing
to
andrew
i
thought
i
would
send
a
message
to
the
professor
i
had
already
written
him
a
long
letter
in
my
mind
but
somehow
when
i
began
putting
it
on
paper
a
sort
of
awkwardness
came
over
me
i
did
know
just
how
to
begin
i
thought
how
much
more
fun
it
would
be
if
he
were
there
himself
and
i
could
listen
to
him
talk
and
then
while
i
was
writing
the
first
few
sentences
some
of
the
drummers
came
back
into
the
room
thought
you
like
to
see
a
sunday
paper
said
one
of
them
i
picked
up
the
newspaper
with
a
word
of
thanks
and
ran
an
eye
over
the
headlines
the
ugly
black
letters
stood
up
before
me
and
my
heart
gave
a
great
contraction
i
felt
my
fingertips
turn
cold
disastrous
wreck
on
the
shore
line
express
runs
into
open
switch
ten
lives
lost
and
more
than
a
score
injured
failure
of
block
signals
the
letters
seemed
to
stand
up
before
me
as
large
as
a
malted
milk
signboard
with
a
shuddering
apprehension
i
read
the
details
apparently
the
express
that
left
providence
at
four
on
saturday
afternoon
had
crashed
into
an
open
siding
near
willdon
about
six
and
collided
with
a
string
of
freight
empties
the
baggage
car
had
been
demolished
and
the
smoker
had
turned
over
and
gone
down
an
embankment
there
were
ten
men
killed
my
head
swam
was
that
the
train
the
professor
had
taken
let
me
see
he
left
woodbridge
on
a
local
train
at
three
he
had
said
the
day
before
that
the
express
left
port
vigor
at
five
if
he
had
changed
to
the
express
in
a
kind
of
fascinated
horror
my
eye
caught
the
list
of
the
dead
i
ran
down
the
names
thank
god
no
mifflin
was
not
among
them
then
i
saw
the
last
entry
unidentified
man
what
if
that
should
be
the
professor
and
i
suddenly
felt
dizzy
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
fainted
thank
goodness
no
one
else
was
in
the
room
the
drummers
had
gone
outside
again
and
no
one
heard
me
flop
off
the
chair
i
came
to
in
a
moment
my
heart
whirling
like
a
spinning
top
at
first
i
did
not
realize
what
was
wrong
then
my
eye
fell
on
the
newspaper
again
feverishly
i
the
account
and
the
names
of
the
injured
too
which
i
had
missed
before
nowhere
was
there
a
name
i
knew
but
the
tragic
words
unidentified
man
danced
before
my
eyes
oh
if
it
were
the
professor
in
a
wave
the
truth
burst
upon
me
i
loved
that
little
man
i
loved
him
i
loved
him
he
had
brought
something
new
into
my
life
and
his
brave
quaint
ways
had
warmed
my
fat
old
heart
for
the
first
time
in
an
intolerable
gush
of
pain
i
seemed
to
know
that
my
life
could
never
again
be
endurable
without
him
and
now
what
was
i
to
do
how
could
i
learn
the
truth
certainly
if
he
been
on
the
train
and
had
escaped
from
the
wreck
unhurt
he
would
have
sent
a
message
to
sabine
farm
to
let
me
know
at
any
rate
that
was
a
possibility
i
rushed
to
the
telephone
to
call
up
andrew
oh
the
agonizing
slowness
of
telephone
connections
when
urgent
hurry
is
needed
my
voice
shook
as
i
said
redfield
j
to
the
operator
throbbing
with
nervousness
i
waited
to
hear
the
familiar
click
of
the
receiver
at
the
other
end
i
could
hear
the
redfield
switchboard
receive
the
call
and
put
in
the
plug
to
connect
with
our
wire
in
imagination
i
could
see
the
telephone
against
the
wall
in
the
old
hallway
at
sabine
farm
i
could
see
the
soiled
patch
of
plaster
where
andrew
rests
his
elbow
when
he
talks
into
the
and
the
place
where
he
jots
numbers
down
in
pencil
and
i
rub
them
off
with
bread
crumbs
i
could
see
andrew
coming
out
of
the
to
answer
the
bell
and
then
the
operator
said
carelessly
does
answer
my
forehead
was
wet
as
i
came
out
of
the
booth
i
hope
i
may
never
have
to
the
horrors
of
the
next
hour
in
spite
of
my
bluff
and
hearty
ways
in
times
of
trouble
i
am
as
reticent
as
a
clam
i
was
determined
to
hide
my
agony
and
anxiety
from
the
people
of
the
moose
hotel
i
hurried
to
the
railway
station
to
send
a
telegram
to
the
professor
address
in
brooklyn
but
found
the
place
closed
a
boy
told
me
it
would
not
be
open
until
the
afternoon
from
a
drugstore
i
called
information
in
willdon
and
finally
got
connected
with
some
undertaker
to
whom
the
willdon
operator
referred
me
a
horrible
condoling
voice
have
you
ever
talked
to
an
undertaker
over
the
telephone
answered
me
that
no
one
by
the
name
of
mifflin
had
been
among
the
dead
but
admitted
that
there
was
one
body
still
unidentified
he
used
one
ghastly
word
that
made
me
shudder
unrecognizable
i
rang
off
i
knew
then
for
the
first
time
the
horror
of
loneliness
i
thought
of
the
poor
little
man
notebook
that
i
had
seen
i
thought
of
his
fearless
and
lovable
ways
of
his
pathetic
little
tweed
cap
of
the
missing
button
of
his
jacket
of
the
bungling
darns
on
his
frayed
sleeve
it
seemed
to
me
that
heaven
could
mean
nothing
more
than
to
roll
creaking
along
country
roads
in
parnassus
with
the
professor
beside
me
on
the
seat
what
if
i
had
known
him
only
how
long
was
it
he
had
brought
the
splendour
of
an
ideal
into
my
humdrum
life
and
now
had
i
lost
it
forever
andrew
and
the
farm
seemed
faint
and
far
away
i
was
a
homely
old
woman
mortally
lonely
and
helpless
in
my
perplexity
i
walked
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
burst
into
tears
finally
i
got
a
grip
on
myself
again
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
now
admitted
frankly
what
i
had
been
hiding
from
myself
i
was
in
love
in
love
with
a
little
bookseller
who
seemed
to
me
more
splendid
than
sir
galahad
and
i
vowed
that
if
he
would
have
me
i
would
follow
him
to
the
other
end
of
nowhere
i
walked
back
to
the
hotel
i
thought
i
would
make
one
more
try
to
get
andrew
on
the
telephone
my
whole
soul
quivered
when
at
last
i
heard
the
receiver
click
hello
said
andrew
voice
oh
andrew
i
said
this
is
helen
where
are
you
his
voice
sounded
cross
andrew
is
there
any
any
message
from
mifflin
that
wreck
yesterday
he
might
have
been
on
that
train
i
been
so
frightened
do
you
think
he
was
hurt
stuff
and
nonsense
said
andrew
if
you
want
to
know
about
mifflin
he
in
jail
in
port
vigor
and
then
i
think
andrew
must
have
been
surprised
i
began
to
laugh
and
cry
simultaneously
and
in
my
agitation
i
set
down
the
receiver
chapter
thirteen
my
first
impulse
was
to
hide
myself
in
some
obscure
corner
where
i
could
vent
my
feelings
without
fear
or
favour
i
composed
my
face
as
well
as
i
could
before
leaving
the
booth
then
i
sidled
across
the
lobby
and
slipped
out
of
the
side
door
i
found
my
way
into
the
stable
where
good
old
peg
was
munching
in
her
stall
the
fine
homely
smell
of
horseflesh
and
harness
leather
went
right
to
my
heart
and
while
bock
frisked
at
my
knees
i
laid
my
head
on
peg
neck
and
cried
i
think
that
fat
old
mare
understood
me
she
was
as
tubby
and
prosaic
and
as
i
but
she
loved
the
professor
suddenly
andrew
words
echoed
again
in
my
mind
i
had
barely
heeded
them
before
in
the
great
joy
of
my
relief
but
now
their
significance
came
to
me
in
jail
the
professor
in
jail
that
was
the
meaning
of
his
strange
disappearance
at
woodbridge
that
little
brute
of
a
man
shirley
must
have
telephoned
from
redfield
and
when
the
professor
came
to
the
woodbridge
bank
to
cash
that
check
they
had
arrested
him
that
was
why
they
had
shoved
me
into
that
mahogany
andrew
must
be
behind
this
the
besotted
old
fool
my
face
burned
with
anger
and
humiliation
i
never
knew
before
what
it
means
to
be
really
infuriated
i
could
feel
my
brain
tingle
the
professor
in
jail
the
gallant
chivalrous
little
man
penned
up
with
hoboes
and
sneak
thieves
suspected
of
being
a
crook
as
if
i
could
take
care
of
myself
what
did
they
think
he
was
anyway
a
kidnapper
instantly
i
decided
i
would
hurry
back
to
port
vigor
without
delay
if
andrew
had
had
the
professor
locked
up
it
could
only
be
on
the
charge
of
defrauding
me
certainly
it
could
be
for
giving
him
a
bloody
nose
on
the
road
from
shelby
and
if
i
appeared
to
deny
the
charge
surely
they
would
have
to
let
mifflin
go
i
believe
i
must
have
been
talking
to
myself
in
peg
stall
at
any
rate
just
at
this
moment
the
stableman
appeared
and
looked
very
bewildered
when
he
saw
me
with
flushed
face
and
in
obvious
excitement
talking
to
the
horse
i
asked
him
when
was
the
next
train
to
port
vigor
well
he
said
they
say
that
all
the
local
trains
is
held
up
till
the
wreck
at
willdon
cleared
away
this
being
sunday
i
do
think
you
get
anything
from
here
until
morning
i
reflected
it
was
so
awfully
far
back
to
port
vigor
a
flivver
from
the
local
garage
could
spin
me
back
there
in
a
couple
of
hours
at
the
most
but
somehow
it
seemed
more
fitting
to
go
to
the
professor
rescue
in
his
own
parnassus
even
if
it
would
take
longer
to
get
there
to
tell
the
truth
while
i
was
angry
and
humiliated
at
the
thought
of
his
being
put
in
jail
by
andrew
i
could
help
deep
down
within
me
being
rather
thankful
suppose
he
had
been
in
the
wreck
the
sage
of
redfield
had
played
the
part
of
providence
after
all
and
if
i
set
out
right
away
with
parnassus
i
could
get
to
port
vigor
well
by
monday
morning
anyway
the
good
people
of
the
moose
hotel
were
genuinely
surprised
at
the
hurry
with
which
i
dispatched
my
lunch
but
i
gave
them
no
explanations
goodness
knows
my
head
was
full
of
other
thoughts
and
the
apple
sauce
might
have
been
asbestos
you
know
a
woman
only
falls
in
love
once
in
her
life
and
if
it
waits
until
she
darn
near
forty
well
it
you
see
i
had
even
been
vaccinated
against
it
by
girlish
flirtations
i
began
to
be
a
governess
when
i
was
just
a
kid
and
a
governess
does
get
many
chances
to
be
skittish
so
now
when
it
came
it
hit
me
hard
that
when
a
woman
finds
herself
when
she
in
love
i
do
care
if
she
old
or
fat
or
homely
or
prosy
she
feels
that
little
flutter
under
her
ribs
and
she
drops
from
the
tree
like
a
ripe
plum
i
did
care
if
roger
mifflin
and
i
were
as
odd
a
couple
as
old
johnson
and
his
wife
i
only
knew
one
thing
that
when
i
saw
that
little
red
devil
again
i
was
going
to
be
all
his
if
he
have
me
that
why
the
old
moose
hotel
in
bath
is
always
sacred
to
me
that
where
i
learned
that
life
still
held
something
fresh
for
me
something
better
than
baking
champlain
biscuits
for
andrew
that
sunday
was
one
of
those
mellow
golden
days
that
we
new
englanders
get
in
october
the
year
really
begins
in
march
as
every
farmer
knows
and
by
the
end
of
september
or
the
beginning
of
october
the
season
has
come
to
its
perfect
ripened
climax
there
are
a
few
days
when
the
world
seems
to
hang
still
in
a
dreaming
sweet
hush
at
the
very
fulness
of
the
fruit
before
the
decline
sets
in
i
have
no
words
like
andrew
to
describe
it
but
every
autumn
for
years
i
have
noticed
it
i
remember
that
sometimes
at
the
farm
i
used
to
lean
over
the
wood
pile
for
a
moment
just
before
supper
to
watch
those
purple
october
sunsets
i
would
hear
the
sharp
ting
of
andrew
little
typewriter
bell
as
he
was
working
in
his
study
and
then
i
would
try
to
swallow
down
within
me
the
beauty
and
wistfulness
of
it
all
and
run
back
to
mash
the
potatoes
peg
drew
parnassus
along
the
backward
road
with
a
merry
little
rumble
i
think
she
knew
we
were
going
back
to
the
professor
bock
careered
mightily
along
the
wayside
and
i
had
much
time
for
thinking
on
the
whole
i
was
glad
for
i
had
much
to
ponder
an
adventure
that
had
started
as
a
mere
lark
or
whim
had
now
become
for
me
the
very
gist
of
life
itself
i
was
fanciful
i
guess
and
as
romantic
as
a
young
hen
but
by
the
bones
of
george
eliot
i
sorry
for
the
woman
that
never
has
a
chance
to
be
fanciful
mifflin
was
in
jail
aye
but
he
might
have
been
dead
and
unrecognizable
my
heart
refused
to
be
altogether
sad
i
was
on
my
way
to
deliver
him
from
durance
vile
there
seemed
a
kinship
between
the
season
and
myself
i
mused
seeing
the
goldenrod
turning
bronze
and
droopy
along
the
way
here
was
i
in
the
full
fruition
of
womanhood
on
the
verge
of
my
decline
into
autumn
and
lo
by
the
grace
of
god
i
had
found
my
man
my
master
he
had
touched
me
with
his
own
fire
and
courage
i
did
care
what
happened
to
andrew
or
to
sabine
farm
or
to
anything
else
in
the
world
here
were
my
hearth
and
my
home
parnassus
or
wherever
roger
should
pitch
his
tent
i
dreamed
of
crossing
the
brooklyn
bridge
with
him
at
dusk
watching
the
skyscrapers
etched
against
a
burning
sky
i
believed
in
calling
things
by
their
true
names
ink
is
ink
even
if
the
bottle
is
marked
commercial
fluid
i
did
try
to
blink
the
fact
that
i
was
in
love
in
fact
i
gloried
in
it
as
parnassus
rolled
along
the
road
and
the
scarlet
maple
leaves
eddied
gently
down
in
the
blue
october
air
i
made
up
a
kind
of
chant
which
i
called
hymn
for
a
woman
fat
who
has
fallen
into
love
o
god
i
thank
thee
who
sent
this
great
adventure
my
way
i
am
grateful
to
have
come
out
of
the
barren
land
of
spinsterhood
seeing
the
glory
of
a
love
greater
than
myself
i
thank
thee
for
teaching
me
that
mixing
and
kneading
and
baking
are
not
all
that
life
holds
for
me
even
if
he
love
me
god
i
shall
always
be
his
i
was
crooning
some
such
babble
as
this
to
myself
when
near
woodbridge
i
came
upon
a
big
shiny
motor
car
stranded
by
the
roadside
several
people
evidently
intelligent
and
sat
under
a
tree
while
their
chauffeur
fussed
with
a
tire
i
was
so
absorbed
in
my
own
thoughts
that
i
think
i
should
have
gone
by
without
paying
them
much
heed
but
suddenly
i
remembered
the
professor
creed
to
preach
the
gospel
of
books
in
and
out
of
season
sunday
or
no
sunday
i
thought
i
could
best
honour
mifflin
by
acting
on
his
own
principle
i
pulled
up
by
the
side
of
the
road
i
noticed
the
people
turn
to
one
another
in
a
kind
of
surprise
and
whisper
something
there
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
lean
face
a
stout
woman
evidently
his
wife
and
two
young
girls
and
a
man
in
golfing
clothes
somehow
the
face
of
the
older
man
seemed
familiar
i
wondered
whether
he
were
some
literary
friend
of
andrew
whose
photo
i
had
seen
bock
stood
by
the
wheel
with
his
long
curly
tongue
running
in
and
out
over
his
teeth
i
hesitated
a
moment
thinking
just
how
to
phrase
my
attack
when
the
elderly
gentleman
called
out
where
the
professor
i
was
beginning
to
realize
that
mifflin
was
indeed
a
public
character
heavens
i
said
do
you
know
him
too
well
i
should
think
so
he
said
did
he
come
to
see
me
last
spring
about
an
appropriation
for
school
libraries
and
leave
till
i
promised
to
do
what
he
wanted
he
stayed
the
night
with
us
and
we
talked
literature
till
four
in
the
morning
where
is
he
now
have
you
taken
over
parnassus
just
at
present
i
said
mifflin
is
in
the
jail
at
port
vigor
the
ladies
gave
little
cries
of
astonishment
and
the
gentleman
himself
i
had
sized
him
up
as
a
school
commissioner
or
something
of
that
sort
seemed
not
less
surprised
in
jail
he
said
what
on
earth
for
has
he
sandbagged
somebody
for
reading
nick
carter
and
bertha
clay
that
about
the
only
crime
he
be
likely
to
commit
he
supposed
to
have
cozened
me
out
of
four
hundred
dollars
i
said
and
my
brother
has
had
him
locked
up
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
would
swindle
a
hen
out
of
a
egg
i
bought
parnassus
of
my
own
free
will
i
on
my
way
to
port
vigor
now
to
get
him
out
then
i
going
to
ask
him
to
marry
me
if
he
will
it
not
leap
year
either
he
looked
at
me
his
thin
lined
face
working
with
friendliness
he
was
a
man
short
gray
hair
brushed
away
from
a
broad
brown
forehead
i
noticed
his
rich
dark
suit
and
the
spotless
collar
this
was
a
man
of
breeding
evidently
well
madam
he
said
any
friend
of
the
professor
is
a
friend
of
ours
his
wife
and
the
girls
chimed
in
with
assent
if
you
would
like
a
lift
in
our
car
to
speed
you
on
your
errand
i
sure
bob
here
would
be
glad
to
drive
parnassus
into
port
vigor
our
tire
will
soon
be
mended
the
young
man
assented
heartily
but
as
i
said
before
i
was
bent
on
taking
parnassus
back
myself
i
thought
the
sight
of
his
own
tabernacle
would
be
the
best
balm
for
mifflin
annoying
experience
so
i
refused
the
offer
and
explained
the
situation
a
little
more
fully
well
he
said
then
let
me
help
in
any
way
i
can
he
took
a
card
from
his
and
scribbled
something
on
it
when
you
get
to
port
vigor
he
said
show
this
at
the
jail
and
i
think
you
have
any
trouble
i
happen
to
know
the
people
there
so
after
a
all
round
i
went
on
again
much
cheered
by
this
friendly
little
incident
it
was
till
i
was
some
way
along
the
road
that
i
thought
of
looking
at
the
card
he
had
given
me
then
i
realized
why
the
man
face
had
been
familiar
the
card
read
quite
simply
raleigh
stone
stafford
the
executive
mansion
darlington
it
was
the
governor
of
the
state
chapter
fourteen
i
could
help
chuckling
as
parnassus
came
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
i
saw
the
river
in
the
distance
once
more
how
different
all
this
was
from
my
girlhood
visions
of
romance
that
has
been
characteristic
of
my
life
all
along
it
has
been
full
of
homely
workaday
happenings
and
often
rather
comic
in
spite
of
my
best
resolves
to
be
highbrow
and
serious
all
the
same
i
was
something
near
to
tears
as
i
thought
of
the
tragic
wreck
at
willdon
and
the
hearts
that
must
be
mourning
i
wondered
whether
the
governor
was
now
returning
from
willdon
after
ordering
an
inquiry
on
his
card
he
had
written
please
release
mifflin
at
once
and
show
this
lady
all
courtesies
so
i
did
anticipate
any
particular
trouble
this
made
me
all
the
more
anxious
to
push
on
and
after
crossing
the
ferry
we
halted
in
woodbridge
only
long
enough
for
supper
i
drove
past
the
bank
where
i
had
waited
in
the
anteroom
and
would
have
been
glad
of
a
chance
to
horsewhip
that
sneaking
little
cashier
i
wondered
how
they
had
transported
the
professor
to
port
vigor
and
thought
ironically
that
it
was
only
that
saturday
morning
when
he
had
suggested
taking
the
hoboes
to
the
same
jail
still
i
do
not
doubt
that
his
philosophic
spirit
had
made
the
best
of
it
all
woodbridge
was
as
dead
as
any
country
town
is
on
sunday
night
at
the
little
hotel
where
i
had
supper
there
was
no
topic
of
conversation
except
the
wreck
but
the
proprietor
when
i
paid
my
bill
happened
to
notice
parnassus
in
the
yard
that
the
bus
that
pedlar
sold
you
ai
it
he
asked
with
a
leer
yes
i
said
shortly
goin
back
to
prosecute
him
i
guess
he
suggested
say
that
feller
a
devil
believe
when
the
sheriff
tried
to
put
the
cuffs
on
him
he
gave
him
a
black
eye
and
pretty
near
broke
his
jaw
some
scrapper
fer
a
midget
my
own
brave
little
fighter
i
thought
and
flushed
with
pride
the
road
back
to
port
vigor
seemed
endless
i
was
a
little
nervous
remembering
the
tramps
in
pratt
quarry
but
with
bock
sitting
beside
me
on
the
seat
i
thought
it
craven
to
be
alarmed
we
rumbled
gently
through
the
darkness
between
aisles
of
inky
pines
where
the
strip
of
starlight
ran
like
a
ribbon
overhead
then
on
the
rolling
dunes
that
overlook
the
water
there
was
a
moon
too
but
i
was
mortally
tired
and
lonely
and
longed
only
to
see
my
little
redbeard
peg
was
weary
too
and
plodded
slowly
it
must
have
been
midnight
before
we
saw
the
red
and
green
lights
of
the
railway
signals
and
i
knew
that
port
vigor
was
at
hand
i
decided
to
camp
where
i
was
i
guided
peg
into
a
field
beside
the
road
hitched
her
to
a
fence
and
took
the
dog
into
the
van
with
me
i
was
too
tired
to
undress
i
fell
into
the
bunk
and
drew
the
blankets
over
me
as
i
did
so
something
dropped
down
behind
the
bunk
with
a
sharp
rap
it
was
a
forgotten
corncob
pipe
of
the
professor
blackened
and
sooty
i
put
it
under
my
pillow
and
fell
asleep
monday
october
seventh
if
this
were
a
novel
about
some
charming
slender
girl
how
differently
i
would
have
to
describe
the
feelings
with
which
i
woke
the
next
morning
but
these
being
only
a
few
pages
from
the
life
of
a
fat
new
england
housewife
i
must
be
candid
i
woke
feeling
dull
and
sour
the
day
was
gray
and
cool
faint
shreds
of
mist
sifting
up
from
the
sound
and
a
desolate
mewing
of
seagulls
in
the
air
i
was
unhappy
upset
and
yes
shy
passionately
i
yearned
to
run
to
the
professor
to
gather
him
into
my
arms
to
be
alone
with
him
in
parnassus
creaking
up
some
sunny
but
his
words
came
back
to
me
i
was
nothing
to
him
what
if
he
did
love
me
after
all
i
walked
across
two
fields
down
to
the
beach
where
little
waves
were
slapping
against
the
shingle
i
washed
my
face
and
hands
in
salt
water
then
i
went
back
to
parnassus
and
brewed
some
coffee
with
condensed
milk
i
gave
peg
and
bock
their
breakfasts
then
i
hitched
peg
to
the
van
again
and
felt
better
as
i
drove
into
the
town
i
had
to
wait
at
the
grade
crossing
while
a
wrecking
train
rumbled
past
on
its
way
back
from
willdon
that
meant
that
the
line
was
clear
again
i
watched
the
grimy
men
on
the
cars
and
shuddered
to
think
what
they
had
been
doing
the
vigor
county
jail
lies
about
a
mile
out
of
the
town
an
ugly
gray
stone
barracks
with
a
high
spiked
wall
about
it
i
was
thankful
that
it
was
still
fairly
early
in
the
morning
and
i
drove
through
the
streets
without
seeing
any
one
i
knew
finally
i
reached
the
gate
in
the
prison
wall
here
some
kind
of
a
keeper
barred
my
way
ca
get
in
lady
he
said
yesterday
was
visitors
day
no
more
visitors
till
next
month
i
get
in
i
said
you
got
a
man
in
there
on
a
false
charge
so
they
all
say
he
retorted
calmly
and
spat
halfway
across
the
road
you
would
believe
any
of
our
boarders
had
a
right
to
be
here
if
you
could
hear
their
friends
talk
i
showed
him
governor
stafford
card
he
was
rather
impressed
by
this
and
retired
into
a
in
the
wall
to
telephone
i
suppose
presently
he
came
back
the
sheriff
says
he
see
you
but
you
have
to
leave
this
here
dynamite
caboose
behind
he
unlocked
a
little
door
in
the
immense
iron
gate
and
turned
me
over
to
another
man
inside
take
this
here
lady
to
the
sheriff
he
said
some
of
vigor
county
prisoners
must
have
learned
to
be
pretty
good
gardeners
for
certainly
the
grounds
were
in
good
condition
the
grass
was
green
and
trimly
mowed
there
were
conventional
beds
of
flowers
in
very
ugly
shapes
in
the
distance
i
saw
a
gang
of
men
in
striped
overalls
mending
a
roadway
the
guide
led
me
to
an
attractive
cottage
to
one
side
of
the
main
building
there
were
two
children
playing
outside
and
i
remember
thinking
that
within
the
walls
of
a
jail
was
surely
a
queer
place
to
bring
up
youngsters
but
i
had
other
things
to
think
about
i
looked
up
at
that
grim
gray
building
behind
one
of
those
little
barred
windows
was
the
professor
i
should
have
been
angry
at
andrew
but
somehow
it
all
seemed
a
kind
of
dream
then
i
was
taken
into
the
hallway
of
the
sheriff
cottage
and
in
a
minute
i
was
talking
to
a
big
man
with
a
political
moustache
you
have
a
prisoner
here
called
roger
mifflin
i
said
my
dear
madam
i
do
keep
a
list
of
all
our
inmates
in
my
head
if
you
will
come
to
the
office
we
will
look
up
the
records
i
showed
him
the
governor
card
he
took
it
and
kept
looking
at
it
as
though
he
expected
to
see
the
message
written
there
change
or
fade
away
we
walked
across
a
strip
of
lawn
to
the
prison
building
there
in
a
big
bare
office
he
ran
over
a
card
index
here
we
are
he
said
roger
mifflin
age
face
oval
complexion
florid
hair
red
but
not
much
of
it
height
inches
weight
stripped
birthmark
never
mind
i
said
that
the
man
what
he
here
for
he
held
in
default
of
bail
pending
trial
the
charge
is
attempt
to
defraud
one
helen
mcgill
spinster
age
rubbish
i
said
i
helen
mcgill
and
the
man
made
no
attempt
to
defraud
me
the
charge
was
entered
and
warrant
applied
for
by
your
brother
andrew
mcgill
acting
on
your
behalf
i
never
authorized
andrew
to
act
on
my
behalf
then
do
you
withdraw
the
charge
by
all
means
i
said
i
a
great
mind
to
enter
a
against
andrew
and
have
arrested
this
is
all
very
irregular
said
the
sheriff
but
if
the
prisoner
is
known
to
the
governor
i
suppose
there
is
no
alternative
i
can
not
annul
the
warrant
without
some
recognizance
according
to
the
laws
of
this
state
the
next
of
kin
must
stand
surety
for
the
prisoner
good
behaviour
after
release
there
is
no
next
of
kin
surely
there
is
i
said
i
am
the
prisoner
next
of
kin
what
do
you
mean
he
said
in
what
relationship
do
you
stand
to
this
roger
mifflin
i
intend
to
marry
him
just
as
soon
as
i
can
get
him
away
from
here
he
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
i
guess
there
no
stopping
you
he
said
he
pinned
the
governor
card
to
a
blue
paper
on
the
desk
and
began
filling
in
some
blanks
well
miss
mcgill
he
went
on
do
take
away
more
than
one
of
my
prisoners
or
i
lose
my
job
the
turnkey
will
take
you
up
to
the
cell
i
exceedingly
sorry
you
can
see
that
the
mistake
was
none
of
our
fault
tell
the
governor
that
will
you
when
you
see
him
i
followed
the
attendant
up
two
flights
of
bare
stone
stairs
and
down
a
long
whitewashed
corridor
it
was
a
gruesome
place
rows
and
rows
of
heavy
doors
with
little
barred
windows
i
noticed
that
each
door
had
a
combination
knob
like
a
safe
my
knees
felt
awfully
shaky
but
it
was
really
so
as
i
had
expected
the
jailer
stopped
at
the
end
of
a
long
passageway
he
spun
the
clicking
dial
while
i
waited
in
a
kind
of
horror
i
think
i
expected
to
see
the
professor
with
shaved
head
they
could
shave
much
off
his
head
poor
lamb
and
striped
canvas
suit
and
a
ball
and
chain
on
his
ankle
the
door
swung
open
heavily
there
was
a
narrow
clean
little
room
with
a
low
camp
bed
and
under
the
barred
window
a
table
strewn
with
sheets
of
paper
it
was
the
professor
in
his
own
clothes
writing
busily
with
his
back
toward
me
perhaps
he
thought
it
was
only
an
attendant
with
food
or
perhaps
he
did
even
hear
the
interruption
i
could
hear
his
pen
running
busily
i
might
have
known
you
never
would
get
any
heroics
out
of
that
man
trust
him
to
make
the
best
of
it
lemon
sole
and
a
glass
of
sherry
please
james
said
the
professor
over
his
shoulder
and
the
warder
who
evidently
had
joked
with
him
before
broke
into
a
cackle
of
laughter
a
lady
to
see
yer
lordship
he
said
the
professor
turned
round
his
face
went
quite
white
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
of
him
he
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
for
speech
miss
miss
mcgill
he
stammered
you
the
good
samaritan
i
doing
the
john
bunyan
act
see
writing
in
prison
i
really
started
my
book
at
last
and
i
find
the
fellows
here
know
nothing
whatever
about
literature
there
is
even
a
library
in
the
place
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
utter
the
tenderness
in
my
heart
with
that
gorilla
of
a
jailer
standing
behind
us
somehow
we
made
our
way
downstairs
after
the
professor
had
gathered
together
the
sheets
of
his
manuscript
it
had
already
reached
formidable
proportions
as
he
had
written
fifty
pages
in
the
hours
he
had
been
in
prison
in
the
office
we
had
to
sign
some
papers
the
sheriff
was
very
apologetic
to
mifflin
and
offered
to
take
him
back
to
town
in
his
car
but
i
explained
that
parnassus
was
waiting
at
the
gate
the
professor
eyes
brightened
when
he
heard
that
but
i
had
to
hurry
him
away
from
an
argument
about
putting
good
books
in
prisons
the
sheriff
walked
with
us
to
the
gate
and
there
shook
hands
again
peg
whickered
as
we
came
up
to
her
and
the
professor
patted
her
soft
nose
bock
tugged
at
his
chain
in
a
frenzy
of
joy
at
last
we
were
alone
chapter
fifteen
i
never
knew
just
how
it
happened
instead
of
driving
back
through
port
vigor
we
turned
into
a
side
road
leading
up
over
the
hill
and
across
the
heath
where
the
air
came
fresh
and
sweet
from
the
sea
the
professor
sat
very
silent
looking
about
him
there
was
a
grove
of
birches
on
the
hill
and
the
sunlight
played
upon
their
satin
boles
it
feels
good
to
be
out
again
he
said
calmly
the
sage
can
not
be
so
keen
a
lover
of
open
air
as
his
books
would
indicate
or
he
would
be
so
ready
to
clap
a
man
into
quod
perhaps
i
owe
him
another
punch
on
the
nose
for
that
oh
roger
i
said
and
i
afraid
my
voice
was
trembly
i
not
very
eloquent
was
it
and
then
somehow
or
other
his
arm
was
around
me
helen
he
said
will
you
marry
me
i
not
rich
but
i
saved
up
enough
to
live
on
we
always
have
parnassus
and
this
winter
we
go
and
live
in
brooklyn
and
write
the
book
and
we
travel
around
with
peg
and
preach
the
love
of
books
and
the
love
of
human
beings
helen
you
just
what
i
need
god
bless
you
will
you
come
with
me
and
make
me
the
happiest
bookseller
in
the
world
peg
must
have
been
astonished
at
the
length
of
time
she
had
for
cropping
the
grass
undisturbed
i
know
that
roger
and
i
sat
careless
of
time
and
when
he
told
me
that
ever
since
our
first
afternoon
together
he
had
determined
to
have
me
sooner
or
later
i
was
the
proudest
woman
in
new
england
i
told
roger
about
the
ghastly
wreck
and
my
agony
of
apprehension
i
think
it
was
the
wreck
that
made
us
both
feel
inclined
to
forgive
andrew
we
had
a
light
luncheon
together
there
on
the
dunes
above
the
sound
by
taking
a
short
cut
over
the
ridge
we
struck
into
the
shelby
road
without
going
down
into
port
vigor
again
peg
pulled
us
along
toward
greenbriar
and
we
talked
as
we
went
perhaps
the
best
of
it
was
that
a
cold
drizzle
of
rain
began
to
fall
as
we
moved
along
the
hill
road
the
professor
as
i
still
call
him
by
force
of
habit
curtained
in
the
front
of
the
van
with
a
rubber
sheet
bock
hopped
up
and
curled
himself
aginst
his
master
leg
roger
got
out
his
corncob
pipe
and
i
sat
close
to
him
in
the
gathering
gloom
we
plodded
along
as
happy
a
trio
or
quartet
if
you
include
fat
cheery
old
peg
as
any
on
this
planet
summer
was
over
and
we
were
no
longer
young
but
there
were
great
things
before
us
i
listened
to
the
drip
of
the
rain
and
the
steady
creak
of
parnassus
on
her
axles
i
thought
of
my
anthology
of
loaves
of
bread
and
vowed
to
bake
a
million
more
if
roger
wanted
me
to
it
was
after
supper
time
when
we
got
to
greenbriar
roger
had
suggested
that
we
take
a
shorter
road
that
would
have
brought
us
through
to
redfield
sooner
but
i
begged
him
to
go
by
way
of
shelby
and
greenbriar
just
as
we
had
come
before
i
did
not
tell
him
why
i
wanted
this
and
when
finally
we
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
store
at
the
crossroads
it
was
raining
heavily
and
we
were
ready
for
a
rest
well
sweetheart
said
roger
shall
we
go
and
see
what
sort
of
rooms
the
hotel
has
i
can
think
of
something
better
than
that
said
i
let
go
up
to
kane
and
have
him
marry
us
then
we
can
get
back
to
sabine
farm
afterward
and
give
andrew
a
surprise
by
the
bones
of
hymen
said
roger
you
right
it
must
have
been
ten
when
we
turned
in
at
the
red
gate
of
sabine
farm
the
rain
had
stopped
but
the
wheels
sloshed
through
mud
and
water
at
every
turn
the
light
was
burning
in
the
and
through
the
window
i
could
see
andrew
bent
over
his
work
table
we
climbed
out
stiff
and
sore
from
the
long
ride
i
saw
roger
face
set
in
a
comical
blend
of
sternness
and
humour
well
here
goes
to
surprise
the
sage
he
whispered
we
picked
our
way
between
puddles
and
rapped
on
the
door
andrew
appeared
carrying
the
lamp
in
one
hand
when
he
saw
us
he
grunted
let
me
introduce
my
wife
said
roger
well
i
be
damned
said
andrew
but
andrew
is
quite
so
black
as
i
painted
him
when
once
convinced
of
the
error
of
his
ways
he
is
almost
pathetically
eager
to
make
up
i
remember
only
one
remark
in
the
subsequent
conversation
because
i
was
so
appalled
by
the
state
of
everything
at
sabine
farm
that
i
immediately
set
about
putting
the
house
to
rights
the
two
men
however
as
soon
as
parnassus
was
housed
in
the
barn
and
the
animals
under
cover
sat
down
by
the
stove
to
talk
things
over
i
tell
you
what
said
andrew
do
whatever
you
like
with
your
wife
she
too
much
for
me
but
i
like
to
buy
that
parnassus
not
on
your
life
said
the
professor
