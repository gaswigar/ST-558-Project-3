you
are
your
own
forerunner
and
the
towers
you
have
builded
are
but
the
foundation
of
your
and
that
self
too
shall
be
a
foundation
and
i
too
am
my
own
forerunner
for
the
long
shadow
stretching
before
me
at
sunrise
shall
gather
under
my
feet
at
the
noon
hour
yet
another
sunrise
shall
lay
another
shadow
before
me
and
that
also
shall
be
gathered
at
another
noon
always
have
we
been
our
own
forerunners
and
always
shall
we
be
and
all
that
we
have
gathered
and
shall
gather
shall
be
but
seeds
for
fields
yet
unploughed
we
are
the
fields
and
the
ploughmen
the
gatherers
and
the
gathered
when
you
were
a
wandering
desire
in
the
mist
i
too
was
there
a
wandering
desire
then
we
sought
one
another
and
out
of
our
eagerness
dreams
were
born
and
dreams
were
time
limitless
and
dreams
were
space
without
measure
and
when
you
were
a
silent
word
upon
life
s
quivering
lips
i
too
was
there
another
silent
word
then
life
uttered
us
and
we
came
down
the
years
throbbing
with
memories
of
yesterday
and
with
longing
for
tomorrow
for
yesterday
was
death
conquered
and
tomorrow
was
birth
pursued
and
now
we
are
in
god
s
hands
you
are
a
sun
in
his
right
hand
and
i
an
earth
in
his
left
hand
yet
you
are
not
more
shining
than
i
shone
upon
and
we
sun
and
earth
are
but
the
beginning
of
a
greater
sun
and
a
greater
earth
and
always
shall
we
be
the
beginning
you
are
your
own
forerunner
you
the
stranger
passing
by
the
gate
of
my
garden
and
i
too
am
my
own
forerunner
though
i
sit
in
the
shadows
of
my
trees
and
seem
motionless
god
s
fool
once
there
came
from
the
desert
to
the
great
city
of
sharia
a
man
who
was
a
dreamer
and
he
had
naught
but
his
garment
and
a
staff
and
as
he
walked
through
the
streets
he
gazed
with
awe
and
wonder
at
the
temples
and
towers
and
palaces
for
the
city
of
sharia
was
of
surpassing
beauty
and
he
spoke
often
to
the
passersby
questioning
them
about
their
city
but
they
understood
not
his
language
nor
he
their
language
at
the
noon
hour
he
stopped
before
a
vast
inn
it
was
built
of
yellow
marble
and
people
were
going
in
and
coming
out
unhindered
this
must
be
a
shrine
he
said
to
himself
and
he
too
went
in
but
what
was
his
surprise
to
find
himself
in
a
hall
of
great
splendour
and
a
large
company
of
men
and
women
seated
about
many
tables
they
were
eating
and
drinking
and
listening
to
the
musicians
nay
said
the
dreamer
this
is
no
worshipping
it
must
be
a
feast
given
by
the
prince
to
the
people
in
celebration
of
a
great
at
that
moment
a
man
whom
he
took
to
be
the
slave
of
the
prince
approached
him
and
bade
him
be
seated
and
he
was
served
with
meat
and
wine
and
most
excellent
sweets
when
he
was
satisfied
the
dreamer
rose
to
depart
at
the
door
he
was
stopped
by
a
large
man
magnificently
arrayed
surely
this
is
the
prince
himself
said
the
dreamer
in
his
heart
and
he
bowed
to
him
and
thanked
him
then
the
large
man
said
in
the
language
of
the
city
sir
you
have
not
paid
for
your
and
the
dreamer
did
not
understand
and
again
thanked
him
heartily
then
the
large
man
bethought
him
and
he
looked
more
closely
upon
the
dreamer
and
he
saw
that
he
was
a
stranger
clad
in
but
a
poor
garment
and
that
indeed
he
had
not
wherewith
to
pay
for
his
meal
then
the
large
man
clapped
his
hands
and
called
and
there
came
four
watchmen
of
the
city
and
they
listened
to
the
large
man
then
they
took
the
dreamer
between
them
and
they
were
two
on
each
side
of
him
and
the
dreamer
noted
the
ceremoniousness
of
their
dress
and
of
their
manner
and
he
looked
upon
them
with
delight
these
said
he
are
men
of
and
they
walked
all
together
until
they
came
to
the
house
of
judgment
and
they
entered
the
dreamer
saw
before
him
seated
upon
a
throne
a
venerable
man
with
flowing
beard
robed
majestically
and
he
thought
he
was
the
king
and
he
rejoiced
to
be
brought
before
him
now
the
watchmen
related
to
the
judge
who
was
the
venerable
man
the
charge
against
the
dreamer
and
the
judge
appointed
two
advocates
one
to
present
the
charge
and
the
other
to
defend
the
stranger
and
the
advocates
rose
the
one
after
the
other
and
delivered
each
his
argument
and
the
dreamer
thought
himself
to
be
listening
to
addresses
of
welcome
and
his
heart
filled
with
gratitude
to
the
king
and
the
prince
for
all
that
was
done
for
him
then
sentence
was
passed
upon
the
dreamer
that
upon
a
tablet
hung
about
his
neck
his
crime
should
be
written
and
that
he
should
ride
through
the
city
on
a
naked
horse
with
a
trumpeter
and
a
drummer
before
him
and
the
sentence
was
carried
out
forthwith
now
as
the
dreamer
rode
through
the
city
upon
the
naked
horse
with
the
trumpeter
and
the
drummer
before
him
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
came
running
forth
at
the
sound
of
the
noise
and
when
they
saw
him
they
laughed
one
and
all
and
the
children
ran
after
him
in
companies
from
street
to
street
and
the
dreamer
s
heart
was
filled
with
ecstasy
and
his
eyes
shone
upon
them
for
to
him
the
tablet
was
a
sign
of
the
king
s
blessing
and
the
procession
was
in
his
honour
now
as
he
rode
he
saw
among
the
crowd
a
man
who
was
from
the
desert
like
himself
and
his
heart
swelled
with
joy
and
he
cried
out
to
him
with
a
shout
friend
friend
where
are
we
what
city
of
the
heart
s
desire
is
this
what
race
of
lavish
hosts
who
feast
the
chance
guest
in
their
palaces
whose
princes
companion
him
whose
king
hangs
a
token
upon
his
breast
and
opens
to
him
the
hospitality
of
a
city
descended
from
and
he
who
was
also
of
the
desert
replied
not
he
only
smiled
and
slightly
shook
his
head
and
the
procession
passed
on
and
the
dreamer
s
face
was
uplifted
and
his
eyes
were
overflowing
with
light
love
they
say
the
jackal
and
the
mole
drink
from
the
stream
where
the
lion
comes
to
drink
and
they
say
the
eagle
and
the
vulture
dig
their
beaks
into
the
same
carcass
and
are
at
peace
one
with
the
other
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
thing
o
love
whose
lordly
hand
has
bridled
my
desires
and
raised
my
hunger
and
my
thirst
to
dignity
and
pride
let
not
the
strong
in
me
and
the
constant
eat
the
bread
or
drink
the
wine
that
tempt
my
weaker
self
let
me
rather
starve
and
let
my
heart
parch
with
thirst
and
let
me
die
and
perish
ere
i
stretch
my
hand
to
a
cup
you
did
not
fill
or
a
bowl
you
did
not
bless
the
they
told
me
that
in
a
forest
among
the
mountains
lives
a
young
man
in
solitude
who
once
was
a
king
of
a
vast
country
beyond
the
two
rivers
and
they
also
said
that
he
of
his
own
will
had
left
his
throne
and
the
land
of
his
glory
and
come
to
dwell
in
the
wilderness
and
i
said
i
would
seek
that
man
and
learn
the
secret
of
his
heart
for
he
who
renounces
a
kingdom
must
needs
be
greater
than
a
on
that
very
day
i
went
to
the
forest
where
he
dwells
and
i
found
him
sitting
under
a
white
cypress
and
in
his
hand
a
reed
as
if
it
were
a
sceptre
and
i
greeted
him
even
as
i
would
greet
a
king
and
he
turned
to
me
and
said
gently
what
would
you
in
this
forest
of
serenity
seek
you
a
lost
self
in
the
green
shadows
or
is
it
a
in
your
twilight
and
i
answered
i
sought
but
you
for
i
fain
would
know
that
which
made
you
leave
a
kingdom
for
a
and
he
said
brief
is
my
story
for
sudden
was
the
bursting
of
the
bubble
it
happened
thus
one
day
as
i
sat
at
a
window
in
my
palace
my
chamberlain
and
an
envoy
from
a
foreign
land
were
walking
in
my
garden
and
as
they
approached
my
window
the
lord
chamberlain
was
speaking
of
himself
and
saying
i
am
like
the
king
i
have
a
thirst
for
strong
wine
and
a
hunger
for
all
games
of
chance
and
like
my
lord
the
king
i
have
storms
of
and
the
lord
chamberlain
and
the
envoy
disappeared
among
the
trees
but
in
a
few
minutes
they
returned
and
this
time
the
lord
chamberlain
was
speaking
of
me
and
he
was
saying
my
lord
the
king
is
like
myself
a
good
marksman
and
like
me
he
loves
music
and
bathes
thrice
a
after
a
moment
he
added
on
the
eve
of
that
day
i
left
my
palace
with
but
my
garment
for
i
would
no
longer
be
ruler
over
those
who
assume
my
vices
and
attribute
to
me
their
and
i
said
this
is
indeed
a
wonder
and
passing
and
he
said
nay
my
friend
you
knocked
at
the
gate
of
my
silences
and
received
but
a
trifle
for
who
would
not
leave
a
kingdom
for
a
forest
where
the
seasons
sing
and
dance
ceaselessly
many
are
those
who
have
given
their
kingdom
for
less
than
solitude
and
the
sweet
fellowship
of
aloneness
countless
are
the
eagles
who
descend
from
the
upper
air
to
live
with
moles
that
they
may
know
the
secrets
of
the
earth
there
are
those
who
renounce
the
kingdom
of
dreams
that
they
may
not
seem
distant
from
the
dreamless
and
those
who
renounce
the
kingdom
of
nakedness
and
cover
their
souls
that
others
may
not
be
ashamed
in
beholding
truth
uncovered
and
beauty
unveiled
and
greater
yet
than
all
of
these
is
he
who
renounces
the
kingdom
of
sorrow
that
he
may
not
seem
proud
and
then
rising
he
leaned
upon
his
reed
and
said
go
now
to
the
great
city
and
sit
at
its
gate
and
watch
all
those
who
enter
into
it
and
those
who
go
out
and
see
that
you
find
him
who
though
born
a
king
is
without
kingdom
and
him
who
though
ruled
in
flesh
rules
in
spirit
though
neither
he
nor
his
subjects
know
this
and
him
also
who
but
seems
to
rule
yet
is
in
truth
slave
of
his
own
after
he
had
said
these
things
he
smiled
on
me
and
there
were
a
thousand
dawns
upon
his
lips
then
he
turned
and
walked
away
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
and
i
returned
to
the
city
and
i
sat
at
its
gate
to
watch
the
passersby
even
as
he
had
told
me
and
from
that
day
to
this
numberless
are
the
kings
whose
shadows
have
passed
over
me
and
few
are
the
subjects
over
whom
my
shadow
has
passed
the
lion
s
daughter
four
slaves
stood
fanning
an
old
queen
who
was
asleep
upon
her
throne
and
she
was
snoring
and
upon
the
queen
s
lap
a
cat
lay
purring
and
gazing
lazily
at
the
slaves
the
first
slave
spoke
and
said
how
ugly
this
old
woman
is
in
her
sleep
see
her
mouth
droop
and
she
breathes
as
if
the
devil
were
choking
the
cat
said
purring
not
half
so
ugly
in
her
sleep
as
you
in
your
waking
and
the
second
slave
said
you
would
think
sleep
would
smooth
her
wrinkles
instead
of
deepening
them
she
must
be
dreaming
of
something
the
cat
purred
would
that
illustration
drawing
signed
gibran
sleep
also
and
dream
of
your
and
the
third
slave
said
perhaps
she
is
seeing
the
procession
of
all
those
that
she
has
the
cat
purred
aye
she
sees
the
procession
of
your
forefathers
and
your
and
the
fourth
slave
said
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
about
her
but
it
does
not
make
me
less
weary
of
standing
and
the
cat
purred
you
shall
be
fanning
to
all
eternity
for
as
it
is
on
earth
so
it
is
in
at
this
moment
the
old
queen
nodded
in
her
sleep
and
her
crown
fell
to
the
floor
and
one
of
the
slaves
said
that
is
a
bad
the
cat
purred
the
bad
omen
of
one
is
the
good
omen
of
and
the
second
slave
said
what
if
she
should
wake
and
find
her
crown
fallen
she
would
surely
slay
the
cat
purred
daily
from
your
birth
she
has
slain
you
and
you
know
it
and
the
third
slave
said
yes
she
would
slay
us
and
she
would
call
it
making
sacrifice
to
the
the
cat
purred
only
the
weak
are
sacrificed
to
the
and
the
fourth
slave
silenced
the
others
and
softly
he
picked
up
the
crown
and
replaced
it
without
waking
her
on
the
old
queen
s
head
the
cat
purred
only
a
slave
restores
a
crown
that
has
and
after
a
while
the
old
queen
woke
and
she
looked
about
her
and
yawned
then
she
said
methought
i
dreamed
and
i
saw
four
caterpillars
chased
by
a
scorpion
around
the
trunk
of
an
ancient
oaktree
i
like
not
my
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
went
to
sleep
again
and
she
snored
and
the
four
slaves
went
on
fanning
her
the
cat
purred
fan
on
fan
on
stupids
you
fan
but
the
fire
that
consumes
tyranny
thus
sings
the
that
guards
the
seven
caves
by
the
sea
my
mate
shall
come
riding
on
the
waves
his
thundering
roar
shall
fill
the
earth
with
fear
and
the
flames
of
his
nostrils
shall
set
the
sky
afire
at
the
eclipse
of
the
moon
we
shall
be
wedded
and
at
the
eclipse
of
the
sun
i
shall
give
birth
to
a
saint
george
who
shall
slay
thus
sings
the
that
guards
the
seven
caves
by
the
sea
the
saint
in
my
youth
i
once
visited
a
saint
in
his
silent
grove
beyond
the
hills
and
as
we
were
conversing
upon
the
nature
of
virtue
a
brigand
came
limping
wearily
up
the
ridge
when
he
reached
the
grove
he
knelt
down
before

said
o
saint
i
would
be
comforted
my
sins
are
heavy
upon
and
the
saint
replied
my
sins
too
are
heavy
upon
and
the
brigand
said
but
i
am
a
thief
and
a
and
the
saint
replied
i
too
am
a
thief
and
a
and
the
brigand
said
but
i
am
a
murderer
and
the
blood
of
many
men
cries
in
my
and
the
saint
replied
i
too
am
a
murderer
and
in
my
ears
cries
the
blood
of
many
and
the
brigand
said
i
have
committed
countless
and
the
saint
replied
i
too
have
committed
crimes
without
then
the
brigand
stood
up
and
gazed
at
the
saint
and
there
was
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
and
when
he
left
us
he
went
skipping
down
the
hill
and
i
turned
to
the
saint
and
said
wherefore
did
you
accuse
yourself
of
uncommitted
crimes
see
you
not
that
this
man
went
away
no
longer
believing
in
you
and
the
saint
answered
it
is
true
he
no
longer
believes
in
me
but
he
went
away
much
at
that
moment
we
heard
the
brigand
singing
in
the
distance
and
the
echo
of
his
song
filled
the
valley
with
gladness
the
plutocrat
in
my
wanderings
i
once
saw
upon
an
island
a
monster
who
ate
of
the
earth
and
drank
of
the
sea
incessantly
and
for
a
long
while
i
watched
him
then
i
approached
him
and
said
have
you
never
enough
is
your
hunger
never
satisfied
and
your
thirst
never
quenched
and
he
answered
saying
yes
i
am
satisfied
nay
i
am
weary
of
eating
and
drinking
but
i
am
afraid
that
tomorrow
there
will
be
no
more
earth
to
eat
and
no
more
sea
to
the
greater
self
this
came
to
pass
after
the
coronation
of
nufsibaäl
king
of
byblus
he
retired
to
his
bed
chamber
the
very
room
which
the
three
of
the
mountain
had
built
for
him
he
took
off
his
crown
and
his
royal
raiment
and
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
thinking
of
himself
now
the
ruler
of
byblus
suddenly
he
turned
and
he
saw
stepping
out
of
the
silver
mirror
which
his
mother
had
given
him
a
naked
man
the
king
was
startled
and
he
cried
out
to
the
man
what
would
you
and
the
naked
man
answered
naught
but
this
why
have
they
crowned
you
king
and
the
king
answered
because
i
am
the
noblest
man
in
the
then
the
naked
man
said
if
you
were
still
more
noble
you
would
not
be
and
the
king
said
because
i
am
the
mightiest
man
in
the
land
they
crowned
and
the
naked
man
said
if
you
were
mightier
yet
you
would
not
be
then
the
king
said
because
i
am
the
wisest
man
they
crowned
me
and
the
naked
man
said
if
you
were
still
wiser
you
would
not
choose
to
be
then
the
king
fell
to
the
floor
and
wept
bitterly
the
naked
man
looked
down
upon
him
then
he
took
up
the
crown
and
with
tenderness
replaced
it
upon
the
king
s
bent
head
and
the
naked
man
gazing
lovingly
upon
the
king
entered
into
the
mirror
and
the
king
roused
and
straightway
he
looked
into
the
mirror
and
he
saw
there
but
himself
crowned

once
high
above
a
pasture
where
a
sheep
and
a
lamb
were
grazing
an
eagle
was
circling
and
gazing
hungrily
down
upon
the
lamb
and
as
he
was
about
to
descend
and
seize
his
prey
another
eagle
appeared
and
hovered
above
the
sheep
and
her
young
with
the
same
hungry
intent
then
the
two
rivals
began
to
fight
filling
the
sky
with
their
fierce
cries
the
sheep
looked
up
and
was
much
astonished
she
turned
to
the
lamb
and
said
how
strange
my
child
that
these
two
noble
birds
should
attack
one
another
is
not
the
vast
sky
large
enough
for
both
of
them
pray
my
little
one
pray
in
your
heart
that
god
may
make
peace
between
your
winged
and

one
nightfall
a
man
travelling
on
horseback
toward
the
sea
reached
an
inn
by
the
roadside
he
dismounted
and
confident
in
man
and
night
like
all
riders
toward
the
sea
he
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
beside
the
door
and
entered
into
the
inn
at
midnight
when
all
were
asleep
a
thief
came
and
stole
the
traveller
s
horse
in
the
morning
the
man
awoke
and
discovered
that
his
horse
was
stolen
and
he
grieved
for
his
horse
and
that
a
man
had
found
it
in
his
heart
to
steal
then
his
came
and
stood
around
him
and
began
to
talk
and
the
first
man
said
how
foolish
of
you
to
tie
your
horse
outside
the
and
the
second
said
still
more
foolish
without
even
hobbling
the
horse
and
the
third
man
said
it
is
stupid
at
best
to
travel
to
the
sea
on
and
the
fourth
said
only
the
indolent
and
the
slow
of

then
the
traveller
was
much
astonished
at
last
he
cried
my
friends
because
my
horse
is
stolen
you
have
hastened
one
and
all
to
tell
me
my
faults
and
my
shortcomings
but
strange
not
one
word
of
reproach
have
you
uttered
about
the
man
who
stole
my
poets
four
poets
were
sitting
around
a
bowl
of
punch
that
stood
on
a
table
said
the
first
poet
methinks
i
see
with
my
third
eye
the
fragrance
of
this
wine
hovering
in
space
like
a
cloud
of
birds
in
an
enchanted
the
second
poet
raised
his
head
and
said
with
my
inner
ear
i
can
hear
those
singing
and
the
melody
holds
my
heart
as
the
white
rose
imprisons
the
bee
within
her
the
third
poet
closed
his
eyes
and
stretched
his
arm
upward
and
said
i
touch
them
with
my
hand
i
feel
their
wings
like
the
breath
of
a
sleeping
fairy
brushing
against
my
then
the
fourth
poet
rose
and
lifted
up
the
bowl
and
he
said
alas
friends
i
am
too
dull
of
sight
and
of
hearing
and
of
touch
i
can
not
see
the
fragrance
of
this
wine
nor
hear
its
song
nor
feel
the
beating
of
its
wings
i
perceive
but
the
wine
itself
now
therefore
must
i
drink
it
that
it
may
sharpen
my
senses
and
raise
me
to
your
blissful
and
putting
the
bowl
to
his
lips
he
drank
the
punch
to
the
very
last
drop
the
three
poets
with
their

open
looked
at
him
aghast

there
was

the
king
turned
his

upon

departed
in

at

observed
that

in

his

was
dead

established
now
in

lived
a

was
young

and
the

that
very
night
ordered
that
the

should
be

when
he
was

said
unto

prophesy

the

enraged

with

he
slew
the

and
from
that
day
to
this
the
wise
men
of

say
one
to
another
secretly
is
it
not
known
and
has
it
not
been
said
from
of
old
that
ishana
is
ruled
by

four
frogs
sat
upon
a
log
that
lay
floating
on
the
edge
of
a
river
suddenly
the
log
was
caught
by
the
current
and
swept
slowly
down
the
stream
the
frogs
were
delighted
and
absorbed
for
never
before
had
they
sailed
at
length
the
first
frog
spoke
and
said
this
is
indeed
a
most
marvellous
log
it
moves
as
if
alive
no
such
log
was
ever
known
then
the
second
frog
spoke
and
said
nay
my
friend
the
log
is
like
other
logs
and
does
not
move
it
is
the
river
that
is
walking
to
the
sea
and
carries
us
and
the
log
with
and
the
third
frog
spoke
and
said
it
is
neither
the
log
nor
the
river
that
moves
the
moving
is
in
our
thinking
for
without
thought
nothing
and
the
three
frogs
began
to
wrangle
about
what
was
really
moving
the
quarrel
grew
hotter
and
louder
but
they
could
not
agree
then
they
turned
to
the
fourth
frog
who
up
to
this
time
had
been
listening
attentively
but
holding
his
peace
and
they
asked
his
opinion
and
the
fourth
frog
said
each
of
you
is
right
and
none
of
you
is
wrong
the
moving
is
in
the
log

the
water

none

willing
to
admit
that
his
was
not

and
that
the

were
not

pure
fancy
pure
fancy
when
you
know
that
everything
that
leaves
our
sea
by
even
an
inch
and
stays
out
of
it
dies
what
proof
have
you
of
other
lives
in
other
seas
repentance
on
a
moonless
night
a
man
entered
into
his
neighbour
s
garden
and
stole
the
largest
melon
he
could
find
and
brought
it
home
he
opened
it
and
found
it
still
unripe
then
behold
a
marvel
the
man
s
conscience
woke
and
smote
him
with
remorse
and
he
repented
having
stolen
the
melon

the

and
the
vulture
wait
wait
yet
awhile
my
eager
friend
i
shall
yield
but
too
soon
this
wasted
thing
whose
agony
overwrought
and
useless
exhausts
your
patience
i
would
not
have
your
honest
hunger
wait
upon
these
moments
but
this
chain
though
made
of
a
breath
is
hard
to
break
and
the
will
to
die
stronger
than
all
things
strong
is
stayed
by
a
will
to
live
feebler
than
all
things
feeble
forgive
me
comrade
i
tarry
too
long
it
is
memory
that
holds
my
spirit
a
procession
of
distant
days
a
vision
of
youth
spent
in
a
dream
a
face
that
bids
my
eyelids
not
to
sleep
a
voice
that
lingers
in
my
ears
a
hand
that
touches
my
hand
forgive
me
that
you
have
waited
too
long
it
is
over
now
and
all
is
faded
the
face
the
voice
the
hand
and
the
mist
that
brought
them
hither
the
knot
is
untied
the
cord
is
cleaved
and
that
which
is
neither
food
nor
drink
is
withdrawn
approach
my
hungry
comrade
the
board
is
made
ready
and
the
fare
frugal
and
spare
is
given
with
love
come
and
dig
your
beak
here
into
the
left
side
and
tear
out
of
its
cage
this
smaller
bird
whose
wings
can
beat
no
more
i
would
have
it
soar
with
you
into
the
sky
come
now
my
friend
i
am
your
host
tonight
and
you
my
welcome
guest
beyond
my
solitude
beyond
my
solitude
is
another
solitude
and
to
him
who
dwells
therein
my
aloneness
is
a
crowded
and
my
silence
a
confusion
of
sounds
too
young
am
i
and
too
restless
to
seek
that
the
voices
of
yonder
valley
still
hold
my
ears
and
its
shadows
bar
my
way
and
i
can
not
go
beyond
these
hills
is
a
grove
of
enchantment
and
to
him
who
dwells
therein
my
peace
is
but
a
whirlwind
and
my
enchantment
an
illusion
too
young
am
i
and
too
riotous
to
seek
that
sacred
grove
the
taste
of
blood
is
clinging
in
my
mouth
and
the
bow
and
the
arrows
of
my
fathers
yet
linger
in
my
hand
and
i
can
not
go
beyond
this
burdened
self
lives
my
freer
self
and
to
him
my
dreams
are
a
battle
fought
in
twilight
and
my
desires
the
rattling
of
bones
too
young
am
i
and
too
outraged
to
be
my
freer
self
and
how
shall
i
become
my
freer
self
unless
i
slay
my
burdened
selves
or
unless
all
men
become
free
how
shall
my
leaves
fly
singing
upon
the
wind
unless
my
roots
shall
wither
in
the
dark
how
shall
the
eagle
in
me
soar
against
the
sun
until
my
fledglings
leave
the
nest
which
i
with
my
own
beak
have
built
for
them
the
last
watch
at
the
of
night
when
the
first
breath
of
dawn
came
upon
the
wind
the
forerunner
he
who
calls
himself
echo
to
a
voice
yet
unheard
left
his
and
ascended
to
the
roof
of
his
house
long
he
stood
and
looked
down
upon
the
slumbering
city
then
he
raised
his
head
and
even
as
if
the
sleepless
spirits
of
all
those
asleep
had
gathered
around
him
he
opened
his
lips
and
spoke
and
he
said
my
friends
and
my
neighbours
and
you
who
daily
pass
my
gate
i
would
speak
to
you
in
your
sleep
and
in
the
valley
of
your
dreams
i
would
walk
naked
and
unrestrained
far
heedless
are
your
waking
hours
and
deaf
are
your
ears
long
did
i
love
you
and
overmuch
i
love
the
one
among
you
as
though
he
were
all
and
all
as
if
you
were
one
and
in
the
spring
of
my
heart
i
sang
in
your
gardens
and
in
the
summer
of
my
heart
i
watched
at
your
yea
i
loved
you
all
the
giant
and
the
pigmy
the
leper
and
the
anointed
and
him
who
gropes
in
the
dark
even
as
him
who
dances
his
days
upon
the
mountains
you
the
strong
have
i
loved
though
the
marks
of
your
iron
hoofs
are
yet
upon
my
flesh
and
you
the
weak
though
you
have
drained
my
faith
and
wasted
my
patience
you
the
rich
have
i
loved
while
bitter
was
your
honey
to
my
mouth
and
you
the
poor
though
you
knew
my
shame
you
the
poet
with
the
barrowed
lute
and
blind
fingers
you
have
i
loved
in
self
indulgence
and
you
the
scholar
ever
gathering
rotted
shrouds
in
potters
fields
you
the
priest
i
have
loved
who
sit
in
the
silences
of
yesterday
questioning
the
fate
of
my
tomorrow
and
you
the
worshippers
of
gods
the
images
of
your
own
desires
you
the
thirsting
woman
whose
cup
is
ever
full
i
have
loved
you
in
understanding
and
you
the
woman
of
restless
nights
you
too
i
have
loved
in
pity
you
the
talkative
have
i
loved
saying
life
hath
much
to
say
and
you
the
dumb
have
i
loved
whispering
to
myself
says
he
not
in
silence
that
which
i
fain
would
hear
in
words
and
you
the
judge
and
the
critic
i
have
loved
also
yet
when
you
have
seen
me
crucified
you
said
he
bleeds
rhythmically
and
the
pattern
his
blood
makes
upon
his
white
skin
is
beautiful
to
yea
i
have
loved
you
all
the
young
and
the
old
the
trembling
reed
and
the
oak
but
alas
it
was
the
of
my
heart
that
turned
you
from
me
you
would
drink
love
from
a
cup
but
not
from
a
surging
river
you
would
hear
love
s
faint
murmur
but
when
love
shouts
you
would
muffle
your
ears
and
because
i
have
loved
you
all
you
have
said
too
soft
and
yielding
is
his
heart
and
too
undiscerning
is
his
path
it
is
the
love
of
a
needy
one
who
picks
crumbs
even
as
he
sits
at
kingly
feasts
and
it
is
the
love
of
a
weakling
for
the
strong
loves
only
the
and
because
i
have
loved
you
overmuch
you
have
said
it
is
but
the
love
of
a
blind
man
who
knows
not
the
beauty
of
one
nor
the
ugliness
of
another
and
it
is
the
love
of
the
tasteless
who
drinks
vinegar
even
as
wine
and
it
is
the
love
of
the
impertinent
and
the
overweening
for
what
stranger
could
be
our
mother
and
father
and
sister
and
brother
this
you
have
said
and
more
for
often
in
the
marketplace
you
pointed
your
fingers
at
me
and
said
mockingly
there
goes
the
ageless
one
the
man
without
seasons
who
at
the
noon
hour
plays
games
with
our
children
and
at
eventide
sits
with
our
elders
and
assumes
wisdom
and
and
i
said
i
will
love
them
more
aye
even
more
i
will
hide
my
love
with
seeming
to
hate
and
disguise
my
tenderness
as
bitterness
i
will
wear
an
iron
mask
and
only
when
armed
and
mailed
shall
i
seek
then
i
laid
a
heavy
hand
upon
your
bruises
and
like
a
tempest
in
the
night
i
thundered
in
your
ears
from
the
housetop
i
proclaimed
you
hypocrites
pharisees
tricksters
false
and
empty
the
among
you
i
cursed
for
blind
bats
and
those
too
near
the
earth
i
likened
to
soulless
moles
the
eloquent
i
pronounced
the
silent
and
the
simple
and
artless
i
called
the
dead
never
weary
of
death
the
seekers
after
world
knowledge
i
condemned
as
offenders
of
the
holy
spirit
and
those
who
would
naught
but
the
spirit
i
branded
as
hunters
of
shadows
who
cast
their
nets
in
flat
waters
and
catch
but
their
own
images
thus
with
my
lips
have
i
denounced
you
while
my
heart
bleeding
within
me
called
you
tender
names
it
was
love
lashed
by
its
own
self
that
spoke
it
was
pride
half
slain
that
fluttered
in
the
dust
it
was
my
hunger
for
your
love
that
raged
from
the
housetop
while
my
own
love
kneeling
in
silence
prayed
your
forgiveness
but
behold
a
miracle
it
was
my
disguise
that
opened
your
eyes
and
my
seeming
to
hate
that
woke
your
hearts
and
now
you
love
me
you
love
the
swords
that
strike
you
and
the
arrows
that
crave
your
breast
for
it
comforts
you
to
be
wounded
and
only
when
you
drink
of
your
own
blood
can
you
be
intoxicated
like
moths
that
seek
destruction
in
the
flame
you
gather
daily
in
my
garden
and
with
faces
uplifted
and
eyes
enchanted
you
watch
me
tear
the
fabric
of
your
days
and
in
whispers
you
say
the
one
to
the
other
he
sees
with
the
light
of
god
he
speaks
like
the
prophets
of
old
he
unveils
our
souls
and
unlocks
our
hearts
and
like
the
eagle
that
knows
the
way
of
foxes
he
knows
our
aye
in
truth
i
know
your
ways
but
only
as
an
eagle
knows
the
ways
of
his
fledglings
and
i
fain
would
disclose
my
secret
yet
in
my
need
for
your
nearness
i
feign
remoteness
and
in
fear
of
the
ebbtide
of
your
love
i
guard
the
floodgates
of
my
after
saying
these
things
the
forerunner
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
wept
bitterly
for
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
love
humiliated
in
its
nakedness
is
greater
than
love
that
seeks
triumph
in
disguise
and
he
was
ashamed
but
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
and
like
one
waking
from
sleep
he
outstretched
his
arms
and
said
night
is
over
and
we
children
of
night
must
die
when
dawn
comes
leaping
upon
the
hills
and
out
of
our
ashes
a
mightier
love
shall
rise
and
it
shall
laugh
in
the
sun
and
it
shall
be
deathless
