for
permission
to
reprint
the
heir
the
heir
he
introduces
himself
in
less
refined
circles
than
ours
i
said
to
myra
your
behaviour
would
be
described
as
swank
really
to
judge
from
the
airs
you
put
on
you
might
be
the
child
mother
he
jealous
because
he
not
an
aunt
himself
is
he
ducksey
darling
i
do
wish
you
would
keep
dragging
the
baby
into
the
conversation
we
can
make
it
go
quite
well
as
a
duologue
as
to
being
jealous
why
absurd
true
i
not
an
aunt
but
in
a
very
short
time
i
shall
be
an
uncle
by
marriage
which
sounds
to
me
much
superior
that
is
i
added
if
you
still
equal
to
it
myra
blew
me
a
kiss
over
the
cradle
another
thing
you
forgotten
i
went
on
is
that
i
down
for
a
place
as
a
godfather
archie
tells
me
that
it
is
settled
yet
but
that
there
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
it
in
the
clubs
who
the
other
going
to
be
not
thomas
i
suppose
that
would
be
making
the
thing
rather
a
farce
has
dahlia
broken
it
to
you
said
myra
anxiously
simpson
i
asked
in
an
awed
whisper
myra
nodded
and
of
course
thomas
she
said
heavens
not
three
of
us
what
a
jolly
crowd
we
shall
be
thomas
can
play
our
best
ball
we
might
but
of
course
there
are
only
going
to
be
two
godfathers
she
said
and
leant
over
the
cradle
again
i
held
up
my
three
end
fingers
thomas
i
said
pointing
to
the
smallest
me
i
explained
pointing
to
the
next
and
simpson
the
tall
gentleman
in
glasses
one
two
three
oh
baby
sighed
myra
what
a
very
slow
uncle
by
marriage
going
to
have
i
stood
and
gazed
at
my
three
fingers
for
some
time
i
got
it
i
said
at
last
and
i
pulled
down
the
middle
one
the
rumour
in
the
clubs
was
unauthorized
i
do
get
a
place
after
all
say
you
mind
pleaded
myra
you
see
dahlia
thought
that
as
you
were
practically
one
of
the
family
already
an
by
marriage
and
as
she
did
want
to
choose
between
thomas
and
samuel
say
no
more
i
was
only
afraid
that
she
might
have
something
against
my
moral
character
child
i
went
on
rising
and
addressing
the
unresponsive
infant
england
has
lost
a
godfather
this
day
but
the
world
has
gained
a
what
i
do
know
i
want
my
tea
myra
gave
the
baby
a
last
kiss
and
got
up
can
i
trust
him
with
you
while
i
go
and
see
about
dahlia
i
not
sure
it
depends
how
i
feel
i
may
change
him
with
some
poor
baby
in
the
village
run
away
aunt
and
leave
us
men
to
ourselves
we
have
several
matters
to
discuss
when
the
child
and
i
were
alone
together
i
knelt
by
his
cradle
and
surveyed
his
features
earnestly
i
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
he
had
to
offer
myra
which
i
could
not
give
her
this
i
said
to
myself
is
the
face
which
has
come
between
her
and
me
for
it
was
unfortunately
true
that
i
could
no
longer
claim
myra
undivided
attention
but
the
more
i
looked
at
him
the
more
mysterious
the
whole
thing
became
to
me
not
a
bad
kid
said
a
voice
behind
me
i
turned
and
saw
archie
yours
i
believe
i
said
and
i
waved
him
to
the
cradle
archie
bent
down
and
tickled
the
baby
chin
making
appropriate
noises
the
while
one
of
the
things
a
father
has
to
learn
to
do
who
do
you
think
he
like
he
asked
proudly
the
late
gladstone
i
said
after
deep
thought
wrong
hallo
here
dahlia
coming
out
i
hope
for
your
sake
that
the
baby
all
right
if
she
finds
he
caught
measles
or
anything
get
into
trouble
by
a
stroke
of
bad
luck
the
child
began
to
cry
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
ladies
myra
rushed
up
to
him
poor
little
darling
she
said
soothingly
did
his
uncle
by
marriage
frighten
him
then
do
listen
to
her
dahlia
i
said
i
have
done
anything
to
him
we
were
chatting
together
quite
amicably
until
he
suddenly
caught
sight
of
myra
and
burst
into
tears
he
got
a
little
pain
said
dahlia
gently
taking
him
up
and
patting
him
i
think
the
trouble
is
mental
suggested
archie
he
looks
to
me
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
conscience
did
he
say
anything
to
you
about
it
when
you
were
alone
he
did
say
much
i
confessed
but
he
seemed
to
be
keeping
something
back
i
think
he
wants
a
bit
of
a
run
really
poor
little
lamb
said
dahlia
there
he
better
now
thank
you
she
looked
up
at
archie
and
me
i
do
believe
you
two
love
him
a
bit
archie
smiled
at
his
wife
and
went
over
to
the
to
pour
out
i
sat
on
the
grass
and
tried
to
analyse
my
feelings
to
my
nephew
by
marriage
as
an
acquaintance
i
said
he
is
charming
i
know
no
one
who
is
better
company
if
i
can
not
speak
of
his
more
solid
qualities
it
is
only
because
i
do
not
know
him
well
enough
but
to
say
whether
i
love
him
or
not
is
difficult
i
could
tell
you
better
after
our
first
quarrel
however
there
is
one
thing
i
must
confess
i
am
rather
jealous
of
him
you
envy
his
life
of
idleness
no
i
envy
him
the
amount
of
attention
he
gets
from
myra
the
love
she
wastes
on
him
which
might
be
better
employed
on
me
is
a
heartrending
thing
to
witness
as
her
betrothed
i
should
expect
to
occupy
the
premier
place
in
her
affections
but
really
i
sometimes
think
that
if
the
baby
and
i
both
fell
into
the
sea
she
would
jump
in
and
save
the
baby
first
do
talk
about
his
falling
into
the
sea
said
dahlia
with
a
shudder
i
ca
it
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
said
archie
i
was
touching
wood
all
the
time
what
a
silly
godfather
he
nearly
had
whispered
myra
at
the
cradle
it
quite
makes
you
smile
does
it
baby
oh
dahlia
he
just
like
archie
when
he
smiles
oh
yes
he
the
living
image
of
archie
said
dahlia
confidently
i
looked
closely
at
archie
and
then
at
the
baby
i
should
always
know
them
apart
i
said
at
last
that
and
i
pointed
to
the
one
at
the
is
archie
and
this
and
i
pointed
to
the
one
in
the
cradle
is
the
baby
but
then
i
such
a
wonderful
memory
for
faces
baby
said
myra
i
afraid
you
going
to
know
some
very
foolish
people
he
meets
his
godfathers
thomas
and
simpson
arrived
by
the
train
and
myra
and
i
drove
down
in
the
wagonette
to
meet
them
myra
handled
the
ribbons
handled
the
ribbons
we
must
have
that
again
while
i
sat
on
the
and
pointed
out
any
and
things
in
the
road
i
am
very
good
at
this
i
suppose
i
said
there
will
be
some
sort
of
ceremony
at
the
station
the
will
read
an
address
while
his
little
daughter
presents
a
bouquet
of
flowers
you
do
often
get
two
godfathers
travelling
by
the
same
train
look
out
i
said
as
we
swung
round
a
corner
there
an
ant
coming
what
did
you
say
i
so
sorry
but
i
listen
awfully
badly
when
driving
as
soon
as
i
hit
upon
anything
really
good
i
write
it
down
so
far
i
have
been
throwing
off
the
merest
trifles
when
we
are
married
myra
go
on
i
love
that
when
we
are
married
we
sha
be
able
to
afford
horses
so
we
keep
a
couple
of
bicycles
and
you
be
able
to
hear
everything
i
say
how
jolly
for
you
all
right
said
myra
quietly
there
was
no
formal
ceremony
on
the
platform
but
i
did
not
seem
to
feel
the
want
of
it
when
i
saw
simpson
stepping
from
the
train
with
an
enormous
under
his
arm
hallo
dear
old
chap
he
said
here
we
are
you
looking
at
my
bear
i
quite
forgot
it
until
i
strapped
up
my
bags
so
i
had
to
bring
it
like
this
it
squeaks
he
added
as
if
that
explained
it
listen
and
the
piercing
roar
of
the
bear
resounded
through
the
station
very
fine
hallo
thomas
hallo
said
thomas
and
went
to
look
after
his
luggage
i
hope
he
like
it
simpson
went
on
its
legs
move
up
and
down
he
put
them
into
several
positions
and
then
squeaked
it
again
jolly
is
it
ripping
i
agreed
who
it
for
he
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
for
a
moment
my
dear
old
chap
for
the
baby
oh
i
see
that
awfully
nice
of
you
he
love
it
i
wondered
if
simpson
had
ever
seen
a
baby
what
its
name
i
been
calling
it
duncan
in
the
train
but
of
course
he
will
want
to
choose
his
own
name
for
it
well
you
must
talk
it
over
with
him
after
the
ladies
have
gone
to
bed
how
about
your
luggage
we
must
keep
myra
waiting
hallo
thomas
said
myra
as
we
came
out
hallo
samuel
hooray
hallo
myra
said
thomas
all
right
myra
this
is
duncan
said
simpson
and
the
shrill
roar
of
the
bear
rang
out
once
more
myra
her
mouth
firm
but
smiles
in
her
eyes
looked
down
lovingly
at
him
sometimes
i
think
that
she
would
like
to
be
simpson
mother
perhaps
when
we
are
married
we
might
adopt
him
for
baby
she
said
stroking
it
with
her
whip
but
he
wo
be
allowed
to
take
it
into
church
with
him
you
know
no
thomas
i
have
the
luggage
next
to
me
i
want
some
one
to
talk
to
you
come
inside
the
wagonette
simpson
squeaked
his
bear
at
intervals
while
i
tried
to
prepare
him
for
his
coming
introduction
to
his
godson
having
known
the
baby
for
nearly
a
week
and
being
to
some
extent
in
confidence
i
felt
quite
the
family
man
beside
simpson
you
must
try
not
to
be
disappointed
with
his
looks
i
said
anyway
do
let
dahlia
think
you
are
and
if
you
want
to
do
the
right
thing
say
that
he
just
like
archie
archie
does
mind
this
for
some
reason
is
he
tall
for
his
age
samuel
pull
yourself
together
he
is
tall
at
all
if
he
is
anything
he
is
long
but
how
long
only
those
can
say
who
have
seen
him
in
his
bath
you
do
realize
that
he
is
only
a
month
old
my
dear
old
boy
of
course
one
ca
expect
much
from
him
i
suppose
he
is
even
toddling
about
yet
no
no
not
actually
toddling
well
we
can
teach
him
later
on
and
i
going
to
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
him
i
shall
show
him
my
watch
babies
always
love
that
there
was
a
sudden
laugh
from
the
front
which
changed
just
a
little
too
late
into
a
cough
the
fact
is
i
had
bet
myra
a
new
that
simpson
would
show
the
baby
his
watch
within
two
minutes
of
meeting
him
of
course
it
was
a
certainty
yet
but
i
thought
there
would
be
no
harm
in
mentioning
the
make
of
ball
i
preferred
so
i
changed
the
conversation
subtly
to
golf
amidst
loud
roars
from
the
bear
we
drove
up
to
the
house
and
were
greeted
by
archie
hallo
thomas
how
are
you
hallo
simpson
good
heavens
i
know
that
face
introduce
me
samuel
this
is
duncan
i
brought
him
down
for
your
boy
to
play
with
duncan
of
course
the
boy
will
love
it
he
tired
of
me
already
he
proposes
to
meet
his
godfathers
at
four
precisely
so
you
have
nearly
three
hours
to
think
of
something
genial
to
say
to
him
we
spent
the
last
of
the
three
hours
playing
tennis
and
at
four
precisely
the
introduction
took
place
by
great
good
luck
duncan
was
absent
simpson
would
have
wasted
his
whole
two
minutes
in
making
it
squeak
baby
said
dahlia
this
is
your
uncle
thomas
hallo
said
thomas
gently
kissing
the
baby
hand
good
old
boy
and
he
felt
for
his
pipe
baby
said
dahlia
this
is
your
uncle
samuel
as
he
leant
over
the
child
i
whipped
out
my
watch
and
murmured
go
hrs
min
sec
i
wished
myra
had
not
taken
my
two
minutes
so
literally
but
i
felt
that
the
was
safe
simpson
looked
at
the
baby
as
if
fascinated
and
the
baby
stared
back
at
him
it
was
a
new
experience
for
both
of
them
he
like
archie
he
said
at
last
remembering
my
advice
only
smaller
he
added
hrs
min
sec
i
can
see
you
baby
he
said
myra
came
and
rested
her
chin
on
my
shoulder
silently
i
pointed
to
the
finishing
place
on
my
watch
and
she
gave
a
little
gurgle
of
excitement
there
was
only
one
minute
left
i
wonder
what
you
thinking
about
said
simpson
to
the
baby
is
it
my
glasses
you
want
to
play
with
help
i
murmured
this
will
never
do
he
just
looks
and
looks
ah
but
his
uncle
samuel
knows
what
baby
wants
to
see
i
squeezed
myra
arm
hrs
mins
secs
there
was
just
time
i
wonder
if
it
anything
in
his
uncle
waistcoat
no
whispered
myra
to
me
in
agony
not
he
see
it
if
he
wants
to
said
simpson
soothingly
and
put
his
hand
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
i
smiled
triumphantly
at
myra
he
had
five
seconds
to
get
the
watch
out
plenty
of
time
bother
said
simpson
i
left
it
upstairs
he
chooses
a
name
the
afternoon
being
wet
we
gathered
round
the
fire
and
went
into
committee
the
question
before
the
house
said
archie
is
what
shall
the
baby
be
called
and
why
dahlia
and
i
have
practically
decided
on
his
names
but
it
would
amuse
us
to
hear
your
inferior
suggestions
and
point
out
how
ridiculous
they
are
godfather
simpson
looked
across
in
amazement
at
godfather
thomas
really
you
are
taking
a
good
deal
upon
yourself
archie
he
said
coldly
it
is
entirely
a
matter
for
my
colleague
and
myself
to
decide
whether
the
ground
is
fit
for
to
decide
i
should
say
what
the
child
is
to
be
called
unless
this
is
quite
understood
we
shall
hand
in
our
resignations
we
been
giving
a
lot
of
thought
to
it
said
thomas
opening
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
our
time
is
valuable
he
arranged
the
cushions
at
his
back
and
closed
his
eyes
again
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
competition
is
quite
closed
said
archie
entries
can
still
be
received
we
have
really
decided
at
all
put
in
dahlia
gently
it
so
difficult
in
that
case
said
samuel
thomas
and
i
will
continue
to
act
it
is
my
pleasant
duty
to
inform
you
that
we
had
a
long
consultation
yesterday
and
finally
agreed
to
call
him
er
samuel
thomas
thomas
samuel
said
thomas
sleepily
how
did
you
think
of
those
names
i
asked
it
must
have
taken
you
a
tremendous
time
with
a
name
like
samuel
thomas
mannering
went
on
simpson
thomas
samuel
mannering
murmured
thomas
your
child
might
achieve
almost
anything
in
private
life
you
would
probably
call
him
sam
tom
said
a
tired
voice
or
more
familiarly
sammy
tommy
came
in
a
whisper
from
the
sofa
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
dahlia
i
must
say
said
archie
they
my
guests
but
i
tell
you
privately
some
time
there
was
silence
for
a
little
and
then
a
thought
occurred
to
me
you
know
archie
i
said
limited
as
their
ideas
are
you
rather
in
their
power
because
i
was
looking
through
the
service
in
church
on
sunday
and
there
comes
a
point
when
the
clergyman
says
to
the
godfathers
this
child
well
there
you
are
you
know
got
you
you
may
have
fixed
on
montmorency
plantagenet
but
they
only
to
say
and
the
thing
is
done
you
all
forget
said
myra
coming
over
to
sit
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
that
there
a
godmother
too
i
shall
forbid
the
berts
well
that
makes
it
worse
you
have
myra
saying
plantagenet
and
samuel
saying
thomas
and
thomas
saying
samuel
it
will
sound
rather
well
said
archie
singing
it
over
to
himself
thomas
you
take
the
tenor
part
of
course
samuel
thomas
samuel
we
must
have
a
rehearsal
for
five
minutes
myra
thomas
and
simpson
chanted
in
harmony
being
assisted
after
the
first
minute
by
archie
who
took
the
alto
part
of
solomon
joel
he
explained
that
as
this
was
what
he
and
his
wife
really
wanted
the
child
christened
montmorency
plantagenet
being
only
an
invention
of
the
godmother
it
would
probably
be
necessary
for
him
to
join
in
too
stop
cried
dahlia
when
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
you
wake
baby
there
was
an
immediate
hush
samuel
said
archie
in
a
whisper
if
you
wake
the
baby
i
kill
you
the
question
of
his
name
was
still
not
quite
settled
and
once
more
we
gave
ourselves
up
to
thought
seeing
that
he
the
very
newest
little
rabbit
said
myra
i
do
think
he
might
be
called
after
some
very
great
cricketer
that
was
the
idea
in
christening
him
said
archie
gaukrodger
carkeek
butt
bajana
mannering
i
suggested
something
like
that
silly
i
meant
after
fry
after
haigh
murmured
thomas
after
bardsley
would
be
more
appropriate
to
a
rabbit
said
simpson
beaming
round
at
us
there
was
however
no
laughter
we
had
all
just
thought
of
it
ourselves
the
important
thing
in
christening
a
future
cricketer
said
simpson
is
to
get
the
initials
right
what
could
be
better
than
as
a
nickname
for
grace
but
if
initials
had
been
where
would
you
have
been
here
said
archie
the
shock
of
this
reply
so
upset
simpson
that
his
glasses
fell
off
he
picked
them
out
of
the
fender
and
resumed
his
theme
now
if
the
baby
were
christened
thomas
his
initials
would
be
which
are
perfect
and
the
same
as
coleridge
is
that
coleridge
the
or
the
fast
bowler
simpson
opened
his
mouth
to
explain
and
then
just
in
time
decided
not
to
i
forgot
to
say
said
archie
that
anyhow
he
going
to
be
called
blair
after
his
mamma
if
his
name
blair
mannering
i
said
at
once
he
have
to
write
a
book
you
ca
waste
a
name
like
that
crimson
by
blair
mannering
blair
mannering
the
author
of
our
new
serial
stain
on
the
bath
has
been
specially
written
for
us
by
and
blair
mannering
it
simply
asking
for
it
do
talk
about
his
wife
yet
please
smiled
dahlia
let
me
have
him
a
little
while
well
he
can
be
a
writer
a
cricketer
why
not
there
are
others
i
need
only
mention
my
friend
s
simpson
but
the
darling
still
wants
another
name
said
myra
let
call
him
john
and
william
and
henry
the
next
day
and
so
on
until
we
find
out
what
suits
him
best
let
all
go
upstairs
now
and
call
him
samuel
said
samuel
thomas
said
thomas
we
looked
at
dahlia
she
got
up
and
moved
to
the
door
in
single
file
we
followed
her
on
to
the
nursery
the
baby
was
fast
asleep
thomas
we
all
said
in
a
whisper
thomas
thomas
there
was
no
reply
samuel
dead
silence
i
think
said
dahlia
we
call
him
peter
he
is
christened
on
the
morning
of
the
christening
as
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
bathroom
i
met
simpson
coming
out
of
it
there
are
people
who
have
never
seen
simpson
in
his
people
also
who
have
never
waited
for
the
sun
to
rise
in
glory
above
the
peaks
of
the
alps
who
have
never
stood
on
waterloo
bridge
and
watched
paul
come
through
the
mist
of
an
october
morning
well
well
one
can
not
see
everything
hallo
old
chap
he
said
i
was
just
coming
to
talk
to
you
i
want
your
advice
a
glass
of
hot
water
the
last
thing
at
night
i
said
no
sugar
or
milk
a
turkish
bath
once
a
week
and
plenty
of
exercise
you
get
it
down
in
no
time
do
be
an
ass
i
mean
about
the
christening
i
been
to
a
wedding
of
course
but
that
is
quite
the
same
thing
a
moment
while
i
turn
on
the
tap
i
turned
it
on
and
came
back
to
him
now
then
i
at
your
service
well
what
the
er
usual
costume
for
a
christening
leave
that
to
the
mother
i
said
she
see
that
the
baby
dressed
properly
i
mean
for
a
godfather
dahlia
has
conveniently
placed
a
sofa
outside
the
bathroom
door
i
dropped
into
it
and
surveyed
the
thoughtfully
go
like
that
i
said
at
last
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
it
a
affair
or
not
have
you
brought
a
of
course
then
you
must
certainly
i
say
come
out
of
it
myra
i
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
but
it
was
too
late
she
had
stolen
my
bath
well
of
all
the
cheek
the
door
opened
and
myra
head
appeared
round
the
corner
hush
you
wake
the
baby
she
said
oh
samuel
what
a
dream
have
i
seen
it
before
you
have
myra
i
often
dressed
up
in
it
then
i
suppose
it
looks
different
with
a
sponge
because
really
i
said
as
i
took
hold
of
simpson
and
led
him
firmly
away
if
the
baby
knew
that
you
carried
on
like
this
of
a
morning
he
be
shocked
thomas
is
always
late
for
breakfast
simpson
on
this
occasion
was
delayed
by
his
elaborate
toilet
they
came
in
last
together
by
opposite
doors
and
stood
staring
at
each
other
simpson
wore
a
dashing
waistcoat
perfectly
creased
trousers
and
a
magnificent
cravat
thomas
had
on
flannels
and
an
old
blazer
by
jove
said
archie
seeing
simpson
first
you
a
and
then
he
caught
sight
of
thomas
his
eyes
went
from
one
to
the
other
and
at
last
settled
on
the
toast
he
went
on
with
his
breakfast
the
two
noble
godfathers
he
murmured
meanwhile
the
two
godfathers
continued
to
gaze
at
each
other
as
if
fascinated
at
last
simpson
spoke
we
ca
be
right
he
said
slowly
to
himself
thomas
woke
up
is
it
the
christening
i
quite
forgot
it
is
thomas
the
is
well
i
can
change
afterwards
you
do
expect
me
to
wear
anything
like
that
he
said
pointing
to
simpson
do
change
said
archie
both
go
as
you
are
mick
and
mack
the
comedy
duo
simpson
does
the
talking
while
thomas
falls
over
the
pews
simpson
collected
his
breakfast
and
sat
down
next
to
myra
am
i
all
right
he
asked
her
doubtfully
your
tie
up
at
the
back
of
your
neck
i
said
because
if
dahlia
would
prefer
it
he
went
on
ignoring
me
i
could
easily
wear
a
plain
dark
tweed
you
beautiful
samuel
said
myra
i
hope
you
look
as
nice
at
my
wedding
you
do
think
i
shall
be
mistaken
for
the
father
he
asked
anxiously
by
peter
well
that
just
possible
perhaps
if
i
think
you
right
said
simpson
and
after
breakfast
he
changed
into
the
plain
dark
tweed
as
the
hour
approached
we
began
to
collect
in
the
hall
simpson
reading
the
service
to
himself
for
the
twentieth
time
do
we
have
to
say
anything
asked
thomas
as
he
lit
his
third
pipe
simpson
looked
at
him
in
horror
say
anything
of
course
we
do
have
you
studied
it
here
just
have
time
to
read
it
through
too
late
now
better
leave
it
to
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
i
suggested
does
anybody
know
if
there
a
collection
because
if
so
i
shall
have
to
go
and
get
some
money
there
will
be
a
collection
for
the
baby
afterwards
said
archie
i
hope
you
all
been
saving
up
here
he
comes
said
simpson
and
peter
blair
mannering
came
down
the
stairs
with
dahlia
and
myra
good
morning
everybody
said
dahlia
good
morning
say
morning
baby
he
rather
nervous
said
myra
he
says
he
never
been
christened
before
and
what
it
like
i
expect
he
be
all
right
with
two
such
handsome
godfathers
said
dahlia
simpson
looking
well
said
myra
in
a
society
voice
and
do
you
know
dear
that
the
suit
i
seen
him
in
well
are
we
all
ready
you
quite
sure
about
his
name
said
archie
to
his
wife
this
is
your
last
chance
you
know
say
the
word
to
thomas
before
it
too
late
i
think
peter
is
rather
silly
i
said
why
blair
said
myra
i
ask
you
dahlia
smiled
sweetly
at
us
and
led
the
way
with
mannering
to
the
car
we
followed
and
simpson
on
the
seat
next
the
driver
read
the
service
to
himself
for
the
last
time
i
feel
very
proud
said
archie
as
we
came
out
of
the
church
i
not
only
a
father
but
my
son
has
a
name
and
now
i
need
call
him
any
more
he
a
good
boy
was
he
said
myra
thomas
say
at
once
that
your
godson
was
a
good
boy
but
thomas
was
quiet
he
looked
years
older
i
never
read
the
service
before
he
said
i
did
quite
know
what
we
were
in
for
it
seems
that
simpson
and
i
have
undertaken
a
heavy
responsibility
we
are
practically
answerable
for
the
child
education
we
are
supposed
to
examine
him
every
few
years
and
find
out
if
he
is
being
taught
properly
you
can
bowl
to
him
later
on
if
you
like
no
no
it
means
more
than
that
he
turned
to
dahlia
i
think
he
said
simpson
and
i
will
walk
home
we
must
begin
at
once
to
discuss
the
lines
on
which
we
shall
educate
our
child
he
sees
life
there
was
no
one
in
sight
if
done
well
well
done
quickly
i
gripped
the
perambulator
took
a
last
look
round
and
then
suddenly
rushed
it
across
the
drive
and
down
a
side
path
not
stopping
until
we
were
well
concealed
from
the
house
panting
i
dropped
into
a
seat
having
knocked
several
seconds
off
the
record
for
babies
under
one
hallo
said
myra
dash
it
are
there
people
everywhere
i
ca
get
a
moment
to
myself
solitude
where
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
baby
peter
and
i
are
going
for
a
walk
my
eyes
rested
on
her
for
more
than
a
moment
she
was
looking
at
me
over
an
armful
of
flowers
and
well
you
can
come
too
if
you
like
i
said
i
got
an
awful
lot
to
do
she
smiled
doubtfully
oh
if
you
rather
count
the
washing
she
sat
down
next
to
me
where
dahlia
i
do
know
we
meant
to
have
left
a
note
for
her
but
we
came
away
in
rather
a
hurry
at
twelve
am
quite
happy
pursuit
is
suggested
myra
poor
dahlia
she
be
frightened
when
she
sees
the
perambulator
gone
my
dear
what
happen
to
it
is
this
russia
oh
what
happens
to
perambulators
in
russia
asked
myra
eagerly
they
spell
them
differently
i
said
after
a
little
thought
anyhow
dahlia
all
right
well
i
just
take
these
flowers
in
and
then
i
come
back
if
you
and
peter
will
have
me
i
think
so
i
said
myra
went
in
and
left
me
to
my
reflections
which
were
mainly
that
peter
had
the
prettiest
aunt
in
england
and
that
the
world
was
very
good
but
my
pleased
and
fatuous
smile
over
these
thoughts
was
disturbed
by
her
announcement
on
her
return
dahlia
says
she
began
that
we
may
have
peter
for
an
hour
but
he
must
come
in
at
once
if
he
cries
i
got
up
in
disgust
you
spoilt
my
morning
i
said
oh
i
had
a
little
secret
from
dahlia
or
rather
peter
and
i
had
a
little
secret
together
at
least
you
and
i
and
peter
had
a
secret
anyhow
it
was
a
secret
and
i
was
feeling
very
wicked
and
happy
peter
and
i
both
were
and
we
were
going
to
let
you
feel
wicked
too
and
now
dahlia
knows
all
about
the
desperate
deed
we
were
planning
and
to
make
it
worse
all
she
says
is
by
all
means
only
do
get
his
feet
wet
peter
i
said
as
i
bent
over
the
sleeping
innocent
we
are
betrayed
miss
mannering
will
now
relate
her
experiences
said
myra
i
went
into
the
hall
to
put
down
the
flowers
and
just
as
i
was
coming
out
i
saw
dahlia
in
the
corner
with
a
book
and
she
said
your
young
man
how
vulgar
i
interrupted
be
careful
with
my
baby
and
i
said
in
great
surprise
baby
and
she
said
was
very
kindly
running
him
up
and
down
the
drive
just
now
peter
loves
it
but
do
let
them
go
on
too
long
or
there
may
be
an
accident
and
then
she
gave
a
few
more
instructions
and
here
we
are
peter
i
said
to
the
somnolent
one
you
ca
deceive
a
woman
also
men
are
pigs
wake
up
and
we
will
apologize
to
your
aunt
for
doubting
her
sorry
myra
myra
pinned
a
flower
in
my
coat
and
forgave
me
and
we
walked
off
together
with
the
perambulator
peter
is
seeing
a
bit
of
life
this
morning
i
said
what
shall
we
show
him
now
thomas
and
samuel
are
playing
golf
said
myra
casually
i
looked
at
her
doubtfully
is
that
quite
suitable
i
think
if
we
did
let
him
stay
too
long
it
would
be
all
right
dahlia
would
like
him
to
be
overexcited
well
he
ca
be
introduced
to
the
game
too
early
come
on
peter
and
we
pushed
into
more
open
country
the
course
which
simpson
planned
a
year
ago
is
not
yet
used
for
the
open
championship
though
it
is
certainly
better
than
it
was
last
summer
but
it
is
short
and
narrow
and
and
particularly
when
simpson
is
playing
on
it
dangerous
we
are
now
in
the
zone
of
fire
i
said
samuel
repainted
ninepenny
may
whiz
past
us
at
any
moment
perhaps
i
had
better
go
first
i
tied
my
handkerchief
to
myra
sunshade
and
led
the
way
with
the
white
flag
a
ball
came
over
the
barn
and
rolled
towards
us
just
reaching
one
of
the
wheels
i
gave
a
yell
hallo
bellowed
simpson
from
behind
the
barn
you
firing
on
the
ambulance
i
shouted
he
hurried
up
followed
leisurely
by
thomas
i
say
he
said
excitedly
have
i
hurt
him
you
have
not
even
waked
him
he
has
the
special
gift
of
was
it
wellington
or
napoleon
that
of
being
able
to
sleep
through
the
heaviest
battle
hallo
said
thomas
good
old
boy
what
he
been
learning
he
added
with
godfatherly
interest
we
showing
him
life
he
has
come
to
see
simpson
play
golf
does
he
ever
sit
up
asked
simpson
looking
at
him
with
interest
i
do
see
how
he
going
to
see
anything
if
he
always
on
his
back
unless
it
were
something
in
the
air
do
you
ever
get
the
ball
in
the
air
said
myra
innocently
what
will
his
uncle
samuel
show
him
if
he
does
sit
up
i
asked
decide
first
if
it
going
to
be
anything
worth
watching
which
hole
are
you
for
the
third
the
eighth
my
last
shot
had
a
bit
of
a
slice
a
slice
it
had
about
the
whole
joint
i
doubt
i
said
to
myra
if
we
shall
do
much
good
here
let
push
on
but
myra
had
put
down
the
hood
and
taken
some
of
the
clothes
off
peter
peter
stirred
slightly
he
seemed
to
know
that
something
was
going
on
then
suddenly
he
woke
up
just
in
time
to
see
simpson
miss
the
ball
completely
instantly
he
gave
a
cry
now
you
done
it
said
myra
he
got
to
go
in
and
i
afraid
he
go
away
with
quite
a
wrong
idea
of
the
game
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
baby
although
i
am
to
be
his
uncle
by
marriage
i
had
forgotten
him
if
that
about
simpson
form
i
said
to
myra
you
and
i
could
still
take
them
on
and
beat
them
myra
looked
up
eagerly
what
about
peter
she
asked
but
she
did
ask
it
very
firmly
we
promised
dahlia
to
take
him
in
directly
he
cried
i
said
she
be
very
upset
if
she
thought
she
could
trust
us
and
we
got
to
go
in
for
our
clubs
anyway
i
added
peter
was
sleeping
peacefully
again
but
a
promise
is
a
promise
after
all
we
had
done
a
good
deal
for
his
education
that
morning
we
had
shown
him
human
nature
at
work
and
the
position
of
golf
in
the
universe
we
meet
you
on
the
first
tee
said
myra
to
thomas
he
sleeps
it
sad
to
think
that
we
shall
be
in
london
said
simpson
with
a
sigh
rotten
agreed
thomas
and
took
another
peach
there
was
a
moment
silence
we
shall
miss
you
i
said
after
careful
thought
i
waited
in
vain
for
dahlia
to
say
something
and
then
added
you
must
both
come
again
next
year
thank
you
very
much
not
at
all
i
hate
these
awkward
pauses
if
my
host
or
hostess
do
anything
to
smooth
them
over
i
always
dash
in
it
been
delightful
to
have
you
i
went
on
are
you
sure
you
ca
stay
till
wednesday
i
so
sorry
said
dahlia
but
you
took
me
by
surprise
i
had
simply
no
idea
are
you
really
going
i
afraid
so
are
really
staying
said
archie
to
me
help
what
about
peter
asked
myra
is
he
too
young
to
be
taken
from
his
godfathers
we
been
talking
that
over
said
simpson
and
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
we
mapped
his
future
out
very
carefully
and
we
shall
unfold
it
to
you
when
the
coffee
comes
thomas
is
doing
it
with
i
said
have
another
and
make
him
a
sailor
thomas
and
i
passed
the
plate
sailor
indeed
said
dahlia
he
going
to
be
a
soldier
it
too
late
thomas
has
begun
another
one
well
he
have
to
swallow
the
stone
a
trifle
hard
on
the
admiralty
said
archie
it
loses
both
thomas
and
peter
at
one
gulp
my
country
what
of
thee
however
when
thomas
had
peeled
the
peach
i
cleverly
solved
the
difficulty
by
taking
it
on
to
my
plate
while
he
was
looking
round
for
the
sugar
no
no
sugar
thanks
i
said
and
waved
it
away
with
the
coffee
and
cigars
simpson
unfolded
his
scheme
of
education
for
peter
in
the
first
place
he
said
it
is
important
that
even
as
a
child
he
should
always
be
addressed
in
rational
english
and
not
in
that
ridiculous
so
common
with
young
mothers
oh
dear
said
dahlia
my
good
samuel
i
broke
in
this
comes
well
from
you
why
only
yesterday
i
heard
you
talking
to
him
i
think
you
called
him
his
nunkey
ickle
petsy
wetsy
lambkin
you
misunderstood
me
said
simpson
quickly
i
was
talking
to
oh
i
said
rather
taken
aback
well
well
i
not
i
lit
a
cigar
and
i
shall
be
annoyed
if
you
call
me
so
again
at
the
age
of
four
simpson
went
on
he
shall
receive
his
first
lesson
in
cricket
thomas
will
bowl
to
him
i
suppose
that
means
that
thomas
will
have
to
be
asked
down
here
again
said
archie
bother
still
it
not
for
four
years
thomas
will
bowl
to
him
archie
will
keep
wicket
and
i
shall
field
and
where
do
i
come
in
i
asked
you
come
in
after
peter
unless
you
would
rather
have
your
lesson
first
that
the
second
time
i
been
sat
on
i
said
to
myra
why
is
simpson
so
unkind
to
me
i
suppose
he
jealous
because
you
staying
on
another
week
probably
still
i
do
like
it
could
you
turn
your
back
on
him
do
you
think
to
indicate
our
heavy
displeasure
myra
moved
her
chair
round
and
rested
her
elbow
on
the
table
go
on
samuel
said
dahlia
you
lovely
i
suppose
these
are
thomas
ideas
as
well
as
your
own
his
signature
is
duly
appended
to
them
i
did
read
all
said
thomas
that
very
rash
of
you
said
archie
you
do
know
what
you
might
let
yourself
in
for
you
may
have
promised
to
pay
the
child
threepence
a
week
no
there
nothing
like
that
said
simpson
to
archie
evident
disappointment
well
then
at
the
age
of
ten
he
goes
to
a
preparatory
school
has
he
learnt
to
read
yet
asked
dahlia
i
did
hear
anything
about
it
he
can
read
at
six
i
forgot
to
say
that
i
am
giving
him
a
book
which
i
shall
expect
him
to
read
aloud
to
thomas
and
me
on
his
sixth
birthday
thomas
has
got
invitation
said
archie
dash
it
at
fourteen
he
goes
to
a
public
school
the
final
decision
as
to
which
public
school
he
goes
to
will
be
left
to
you
but
of
course
we
shall
expect
to
be
consulted
on
the
subject
i
write
and
tell
you
what
we
decide
on
said
archie
hastily
there
be
no
need
for
you
to
come
down
and
be
told
aloud
so
far
we
have
not
arranged
anything
for
him
beyond
the
age
of
fourteen
i
now
propose
to
read
out
a
few
general
rules
about
his
upbringing
which
we
must
insist
on
being
observed
the
great
question
whether
simpson
is
kicked
out
of
the
house
or
leaves
unobtrusively
by
the
milk
train
morning
is
about
to
be
settled
i
murmured
he
must
be
brought
up
to
be
ambidextrous
it
will
be
very
useful
explained
simpson
when
he
fields
cover
for
england
or
when
he
wants
to
shake
hands
with
two
people
at
once
said
archie
he
must
be
taught
from
the
first
to
speak
french
and
german
fluently
he
thank
you
for
that
later
on
when
he
goes
abroad
or
when
he
goes
to
the
national
liberal
club
said
archie
he
should
be
surrounded
as
far
as
possible
with
beautiful
things
beautiful
toys
beautiful
beautiful
scenery
beautiful
godfathers
i
asked
doubtfully
simpson
ignored
me
and
went
on
hurriedly
with
the
rest
of
his
rules
well
said
archie
at
the
end
of
them
they
all
fairly
futile
but
if
you
like
to
write
them
out
neatly
and
frame
them
in
gold
i
do
mind
hanging
them
up
in
the
bathroom
has
anybody
else
got
anything
fatuous
to
say
before
the
ladies
leave
us
i
filled
my
glass
i
really
got
a
lot
to
say
i
began
because
i
consider
that
been
rather
left
out
of
things
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
i
the
only
person
here
who
is
anything
important
all
the
rest
of
you
being
godfathers
or
godmothers
or
mothers
or
fathers
or
something
however
i
wo
dwell
on
that
now
but
there
one
thing
i
must
say
and
here
it
is
i
raised
my
glass
peter
blair
mannering
and
may
he
grow
up
to
be
a
better
man
than
any
of
us
upstairs
in
happy
innocence
of
the
tremendous
task
in
front
of
him
the
child
slept
poor
baby
we
drank
solemnly
but
without
much
hope
winter
sport
winter
sport
an
introduction
i
had
better
say
at
once
i
announced
as
i
turned
over
the
wine
list
that
i
have
come
out
here
to
enjoy
myself
and
enjoy
myself
i
shall
myra
what
shall
we
drink
you
had
three
weeks
honeymoon
in
october
complained
thomas
and
you
taking
another
three
weeks
now
do
you
ever
do
any
work
myra
and
i
smiled
at
each
other
coming
from
thomas
who
spends
his
busy
day
leaning
up
against
the
wireless
installation
at
the
admiralty
the
remark
amused
us
we
have
champagne
said
myra
because
it
our
opening
night
archie
after
you
with
the
it
was
due
to
dahlia
really
that
the
rabbits
were
hibernating
at
the
hôtel
des
angéliques
switzerland
throughout
for
she
had
been
ordered
abroad
after
an
illness
to
pull
herself
together
a
little
and
her
doctor
had
agreed
with
archie
that
she
might
as
well
do
it
at
a
place
where
her
husband
could
skate
on
the
point
that
peter
should
come
and
skate
too
however
archie
was
firm
while
admitting
that
he
loved
his
infant
son
he
reminded
dahlia
that
she
possibly
get
through
calais
and
pontarlier
without
declaring
peter
and
that
the
duty
on
this
class
of
goods
was
remarkably
heavy
peter
therefore
was
left
behind
he
had
an
army
of
nurses
to
look
after
him
and
a
stenographer
to
take
down
his
more
important
remarks
with
a
daily
bulletin
and
a
record
of
his
promised
her
dahlia
was
prepared
to
be
content
as
for
myra
and
me
we
might
have
hesitated
to
take
another
holiday
so
soon
had
it
not
been
for
a
letter
i
received
one
morning
at
breakfast
simpson
is
going
i
said
he
has
purchased
a
pair
of
skis
that
does
it
said
myra
decisively
and
gurgling
happily
to
herself
she
went
out
and
bought
a
camera
for
thomas
i
can
find
no
excuses
at
a
moment
of
crisis
he
left
his
country
navy
in
jeopardy
and
the
admiralty
yacht
being
otherwise
engaged
booked
a
first
return
from
cook
and
so
it
was
that
at
four
one
day
we
arrived
together
at
the
hôtel
des
angéliques
and
some
three
hours
later
were
settling
down
comfortably
to
dinner
i
had
a
busy
time
said
archie
i
hired
a
small
bob
a
luge
and
a
pair
of
skis
for
myself
a
pair
of
and
some
skates
for
dahlia
a
a
tricycle
horse
for
simpson
and
i
do
know
what
else
all
in
french
what
the
french
for
a
pair
of
asked
myra
i
pointed
to
them
in
french
the
undersized
robert
i
got
at
a
bargain
the
man
who
hired
it
last
week
broke
his
leg
before
his
fortnight
was
up
and
so
there
was
a
reduction
of
several
centimes
i
been
busy
too
i
said
i
been
watching
myra
unpack
and
telling
her
where
not
to
put
my
things
i
packed
jolly
well
except
for
the
accident
an
accident
to
the
i
explained
if
i
get
down
to
my
last
three
shirts
you
will
notice
it
we
stopped
eating
for
a
moment
in
order
to
drink
dahlia
health
it
was
dahlia
health
which
had
sent
us
there
who
your
friend
samuel
said
archie
as
simpson
caught
eye
at
another
table
and
nodded
a
fellow
i
met
in
the
lift
said
simpson
casually
samuel
beware
of
elevator
acquaintances
said
myra
in
her
most
solemn
manner
he
rather
a
good
chap
he
was
at
peterhouse
with
a
friend
of
mine
he
was
telling
me
quite
a
good
story
about
a
my
friend
gave
there
once
when
did
you
tell
him
about
your
at
giggleswick
i
interrupted
my
dear
old
chap
he
rather
a
man
to
be
in
with
he
knows
the
president
i
thought
nobody
knew
the
president
of
the
swiss
republic
said
myra
like
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
not
president
myra
the
president
of
the
angéliques
sports
club
never
heard
of
it
we
all
said
simpson
polished
his
glasses
and
prepared
delightedly
to
give
an
explanation
the
sports
club
runs
everything
here
he
began
it
gives
you
prizes
for
fancy
costumes
and
skating
and
so
on
introduce
me
to
the
president
at
once
cooed
myra
patting
her
hair
and
smoothing
down
her
frock
even
if
you
were
the
treasurer
brother
said
archie
you
get
a
prize
for
skating
simpson
you
never
seen
him
do
a
rocking
seventeen
sideways
simpson
looked
at
us
pityingly
there
a
lot
more
in
it
than
that
he
said
the
president
will
introduce
you
to
anybody
one
might
see
er
somebody
one
rather
liked
the
look
of
and
er
well
i
mean
in
an
hotel
one
wants
to
enter
into
the
hotel
life
and
er
meet
other
people
who
is
she
said
myra
anybody
you
want
to
marry
must
be
submitted
to
myra
for
approval
first
i
said
we
told
you
so
several
times
simpson
hastily
disclaimed
any
intention
of
marrying
anybody
and
helped
himself
lavishly
to
champagne
it
so
happened
that
i
was
the
first
of
our
party
to
meet
the
president
an
honour
which
perhaps
i
hardly
deserved
while
samuel
was
seeking
tortuous
introductions
to
him
through
friends
of
peterhouse
friends
of
his
the
president
and
i
fell
into
each
other
arms
in
the
most
natural
way
it
occurred
like
this
there
was
a
dance
after
dinner
and
myra
not
satisfied
with
my
appearance
sent
me
upstairs
to
put
some
gloves
on
it
is
one
of
the
penalties
of
marriage
that
one
is
always
being
sent
upstairs
with
my
hands
properly
shod
i
returned
to
the
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
a
corner
while
i
looked
about
for
her
suddenly
i
heard
a
voice
at
my
side
do
you
want
a
partner
it
said
i
turned
and
knew
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
the
president
well
i
began
you
are
a
are
you
i
expect
you
do
know
many
people
if
there
is
anybody
you
would
like
to
dance
with
i
looked
round
the
room
it
was
too
good
a
chance
to
miss
i
wonder
i
said
that
girl
over
there
in
the
pink
frock
just
putting
up
her
fan
he
almost
embraced
me
i
congratulate
you
on
your
taste
he
said
excellent
come
with
me
he
went
over
to
the
girl
in
the
pink
dress
i
at
his
heels
er
may
i
introduce
he
said
er
er
yes
this
is
miss
er
yes
evidently
he
did
know
her
name
thank
you
i
said
to
him
he
nodded
and
left
us
i
turned
to
the
girl
in
the
pink
frock
she
was
very
pretty
may
i
have
this
dance
i
asked
i
got
my
gloves
on
i
added
she
looked
at
me
gravely
trying
hard
not
to
smile
you
may
said
myra
the
opening
run
with
a
great
effort
simpson
strapped
his
foot
securely
into
a
ski
and
turned
doubtfully
to
thomas
thomas
he
said
how
do
you
know
which
foot
is
which
it
depends
whose
said
thomas
he
was
busy
tying
a
large
rucksack
of
lunch
on
to
himself
and
was
in
no
mood
for
samuel
chatter
you
got
one
ski
on
one
foot
i
said
then
the
other
ski
goes
on
the
foot
you
got
over
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
seen
that
but
i
may
have
put
the
first
one
on
wrong
you
ought
to
know
after
all
these
years
that
you
are
certain
to
have
done
so
i
said
severely
having
had
my
own
hired
skis
fixed
on
by
the
i
felt
rather
superior
simpson
having
bought
his
in
london
was
regarded
darkly
by
that
gentleman
and
left
to
his
own
devices
are
we
all
ready
asked
myra
who
had
kept
us
waiting
for
twenty
minutes
archie
what
about
dahlia
dahlia
will
join
us
at
lunch
she
is
expecting
a
letter
from
peter
by
the
twelve
post
and
refuses
to
start
without
it
also
she
does
think
she
is
up
to
just
yet
also
she
wants
to
have
a
talk
with
the
girl
in
red
and
break
it
to
her
that
thomas
is
engaged
to
several
people
in
london
already
come
on
growled
thomas
and
he
led
the
way
up
the
hill
we
followed
him
in
single
file
it
was
a
day
of
colour
straight
from
heaven
on
either
side
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
the
snow
above
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
in
front
of
me
the
glorious
apricot
of
simpson
winter
suiting
london
seemed
a
hundred
years
away
it
was
impossible
to
work
up
the
least
interest
in
the
home
rule
bill
the
billiard
tournament
or
the
state
of
paul
cathedral
i
feel
extremely
picturesque
said
archie
if
only
we
had
a
wolf
or
two
after
us
the
illusion
would
be
complete
the
boy
trappers
or
among
the
rocky
mountains
it
is
a
pleasant
thought
archie
i
said
that
in
any
wolf
trouble
the
bachelors
of
the
party
would
have
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
us
myra
dear
the
loss
of
samuel
in
such
circumstances
would
draw
us
very
close
together
there
might
be
a
loss
of
thomas
too
perhaps
for
if
there
was
not
enough
of
simpson
to
go
round
if
there
was
a
hungry
wolf
left
over
would
thomas
hesitate
no
said
thomas
i
should
run
like
a
hare
simpson
said
nothing
his
face
i
could
not
see
but
his
back
looked
exactly
like
the
back
of
a
man
who
was
trying
to
look
as
if
he
had
been
brought
up
on
skis
from
a
baby
and
was
now
taking
a
small
party
of
enthusiastic
novices
out
for
their
first
lesson
what
an
awful
shock
it
would
be
i
said
if
we
found
that
samuel
really
did
know
something
about
it
after
all
and
while
we
were
tumbling
about
anyhow
he
sailed
gracefully
down
the
steepest
slopes
i
should
go
straight
back
to
cricklewood
my
dear
chap
i
read
a
about
it
then
we
quite
safe
with
all
his
faults
said
archie
and
they
are
many
samuel
is
a
gentleman
he
would
never
take
an
unfair
advantage
of
us
hallo
here
we
are
we
left
the
road
and
made
our
way
across
the
snow
to
a
little
wooden
hut
which
archie
had
noticed
the
day
before
here
we
were
to
meet
dahlia
for
lunch
and
here
accordingly
we
left
the
rucksack
and
such
garments
as
the
heat
of
the
sun
suggested
then
at
the
top
of
a
long
steep
at
first
more
gentle
later
we
stood
and
wondered
who
going
first
said
archie
what
do
you
do
asked
myra
you
do
it
does
it
for
you
but
how
do
you
stop
do
bother
about
that
dear
i
said
that
will
be
arranged
for
you
all
right
take
two
steps
to
the
brink
of
the
hill
and
pick
yourself
up
at
the
bottom
now
then
simpson
be
a
man
the
lady
waits
samuel
the
hallo
hi
help
i
cried
as
i
began
to
move
off
slowly
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
about
it
i
called
and
then
things
moved
more
quickly
very
quickly
suddenly
there
came
a
moment
when
i
realized
that
i
was
keeping
up
with
my
feet
i
shouted
to
my
skis
to
stop
it
was
no
good
they
went
on
i
decided
to
stop
without
them
the
ensuing
second
went
by
too
swiftly
for
me
to
understand
rightly
what
happened
i
fancy
that
rising
from
my
sitting
position
and
travelling
easily
on
my
head
i
caught
my
skis
up
again
and
passed
them
then
it
was
their
turn
they
overtook
me
but
i
was
not
to
be
beaten
once
more
i
obtained
the
lead
this
time
i
took
the
inside
berth
and
kept
it
there
seemed
to
be
a
lot
more
snow
than
i
really
wanted
i
struggled
bravely
with
it
and
then
the
earthquake
ceased
and
suddenly
i
was
in
the
outer
air
my
first
the
most
glorious
run
of
modern
times
was
over
ripping
i
shouted
up
the
hill
to
them
but
there
rather
a
nasty
bump
at
the
bottom
i
added
kindly
as
i
set
myself
to
the
impossible
business
of
getting
up
jove
said
archie
coming
to
rest
a
few
yards
off
that
splendid
he
had
fallen
in
a
less
striking
way
than
myself
and
he
got
to
his
feet
without
difficulty
why
do
you
pose
like
that
he
asked
as
he
picked
up
his
stick
i
a
fixture
i
announced
myra
i
said
as
she
turned
a
somersault
and
arrived
beaming
at
my
side
i
here
for
some
time
you
have
to
come
out
every
morning
with
crumbs
for
me
in
the
afternoon
you
can
bring
a
cheering
book
and
read
aloud
to
your
husband
sometimes
i
shall
dictate
little
things
to
you
they
will
not
be
my
best
little
things
for
this
position
with
my
feet
so
much
higher
than
my
head
is
not
the
one
in
which
inspiration
comes
to
me
most
readily
the
flow
of
blood
to
the
brain
impairs
reflection
but
no
matter
are
you
really
stuck
asked
myra
in
some
anxiety
i
should
hate
to
have
a
husband
who
lived
by
himself
in
the
snow
she
said
thoughtfully
let
us
look
on
the
bright
side
said
archie
the
snow
will
have
melted
by
april
and
he
will
then
be
able
to
return
to
you
hallo
here
thomas
thomas
will
probably
have
some
clever
idea
for
restoring
the
family
credit
thomas
got
up
in
a
businesslike
manner
and
climbed
slowly
back
to
us
thomas
i
said
you
see
the
position
indeed
i
added
it
is
obvious
none
of
the
people
round
me
seems
inclined
or
it
may
be
able
to
help
there
is
a
feeling
that
if
myra
lives
in
the
hotel
alone
while
i
remain
here
possibly
till
april
people
will
talk
you
know
how
ready
they
are
there
is
also
the
fact
that
i
have
only
hired
the
skis
for
three
weeks
also
a
minor
point
but
one
that
touches
me
rather
that
i
shall
want
my
hair
cut
long
before
march
is
out
thomas
imagine
me
to
be
a
on
the
maplin
sands
and
tell
me
what
on
earth
to
do
take
your
skis
off
oh
brilliant
said
myra
take
my
skis
off
i
cried
never
is
it
not
my
duty
to
be
the
last
to
leave
my
skis
can
i
abandon
hallo
is
that
dahlia
on
the
hooray
lunch
archie
take
my
skis
off
there
a
good
fellow
we
must
keep
dahlia
waiting
a
typical
morning
you
take
lunch
out
no
said
josef
the
in
his
invariable
formula
myra
and
i
were
alone
at
breakfast
the
first
down
i
was
just
putting
some
honey
on
to
my
seventh
roll
and
was
not
really
in
the
mood
for
light
conversation
with
josef
about
lunch
by
the
way
i
must
say
i
prefer
the
good
old
english
breakfast
with
eggs
and
bacon
and
porridge
you
do
know
when
you
want
to
stop
with
rolls
and
honey
you
hardly
notice
what
you
are
doing
and
there
seems
no
reason
why
you
should
not
go
on
for
ever
indeed
once
but
you
would
never
believe
me
we
take
lunch
out
josef
lunch
for
let
me
see
six
suggested
myra
what
are
we
all
going
to
do
archie
said
something
about
skating
off
that
but
whatever
we
do
we
must
lunch
and
it
much
nicer
outdoors
six
josef
josef
nodded
and
retired
i
took
my
eighth
roll
do
let
get
off
quickly
i
said
there
always
so
much
chat
in
the
morning
before
we
start
i
just
got
one
swift
letter
to
write
said
myra
as
she
got
up
and
then
i
shall
be
pawing
the
ground
half
an
hour
later
i
was
in
the
lounge
booted
capped
gloved
and
putteed
the
complete
bernard
the
lounge
seemed
to
be
entirely
full
of
hot
air
and
entirely
empty
of
anybody
i
knew
i
asked
for
letters
and
getting
none
went
out
and
looked
at
the
thermometer
to
my
surprise
i
discovered
that
there
were
degrees
of
frost
a
little
alarmed
i
tapped
the
thing
impatiently
come
come
i
said
this
is
not
the
time
for
persiflage
however
it
insisted
on
remaining
at
five
degrees
below
zero
what
i
should
have
done
about
it
i
can
not
say
but
at
that
moment
i
remembered
that
it
was
a
centigrade
thermometer
with
the
freezing
point
in
the
wrong
place
slightly
disappointed
that
there
were
only
five
degrees
of
frost
centigrade
i
returned
to
the
lounge
here
you
are
at
last
said
archie
impatiently
what
are
we
all
going
to
do
where
dahlia
asked
myra
let
wait
till
she
comes
and
then
we
can
all
talk
at
once
here
she
is
dahlia
for
heaven
sake
come
and
tell
us
the
arrangements
for
the
day
start
with
the
idea
fixed
in
your
mind
that
myra
and
i
have
ordered
lunch
for
six
dahlia
shepherded
us
to
a
quiet
corner
of
the
lounge
and
we
all
sat
down
by
the
way
said
simpson
are
there
any
letters
for
me
no
it
your
turn
to
write
said
archie
but
my
dear
chap
there
be
one
because
but
you
never
acknowledged
the
i
pointed
out
she
write
till
you
i
mean
it
was
rather
forward
of
her
to
send
them
at
all
and
if
you
have
even
well
said
dahlia
what
does
anybody
want
to
do
thomas
was
the
first
to
answer
the
question
a
girl
in
red
came
in
from
the
and
sat
down
near
us
she
looked
up
in
our
direction
and
met
thomas
eye
good
morning
said
thomas
with
a
smile
and
he
left
us
and
moved
across
to
her
that
the
girl
he
danced
with
all
last
night
whispered
myra
i
ca
think
what
come
over
him
is
this
our
reserved
thomas
thomas
the
taciturn
whom
we
know
and
love
so
well
i
do
like
the
way
she
does
her
hair
she
a
miss
aylwyn
said
simpson
in
a
loud
voice
i
had
one
dance
with
her
myself
the
world
said
archie
is
full
of
people
with
whom
samuel
has
had
one
dance
well
that
washes
thomas
out
anyway
he
spend
the
day
teaching
her
something
what
are
the
rest
of
us
going
to
do
there
was
a
moment
silence
oh
archie
said
dahlia
did
you
get
those
nails
put
in
my
boots
i
looked
at
myra
and
sighed
sorry
dear
he
said
i
take
them
down
now
the
man
will
do
them
in
twenty
minutes
he
walked
over
to
the
lift
at
the
same
moment
that
thomas
returned
to
us
i
say
began
thomas
a
little
awkwardly
if
you
arranging
what
to
do
do
bother
about
me
i
rather
thought
of
er
taking
it
quietly
this
morning
i
think
i
overdid
it
a
bit
yesterday
we
warned
you
at
the
time
about
the
fourth
egg
i
said
i
meant
the
we
thought
of
i
thought
of
having
lunch
in
the
hotel
but
of
course
you
can
have
my
rucksack
to
carry
yours
in
er
i
go
and
put
it
in
for
you
he
disappeared
rather
sheepishly
in
the
direction
of
the
now
samuel
said
myra
gently
now
what
myra
it
your
turn
if
you
have
a
headache
tell
us
her
name
my
dear
myra
i
want
to
ski
where
shall
we
go
let
go
to
the
old
slopes
and
practise
the
christiania
turn
what
you
want
to
practise
is
the
ordinary
hampstead
straight
i
said
a
medium
performance
of
yours
yesterday
samuel
but
my
dear
old
chap
he
said
eagerly
i
told
you
it
was
the
fault
of
my
skis
they
would
stick
to
the
snow
oh
i
say
he
added
that
reminds
me
i
must
go
and
buy
some
wax
for
them
he
dashed
off
i
looked
at
myra
and
sighed
the
wo
be
long
said
archie
to
dahlia
on
his
return
to
call
for
them
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ca
you
wear
some
other
boots
dahlia
or
your
bedroom
slippers
or
something
it
eleven
we
really
must
get
off
soon
but
we
have
settled
where
we
going
yet
then
for
sake
let
do
it
myra
and
i
thought
we
might
go
up
above
the
wood
at
the
back
and
explore
we
can
always
ski
down
it
might
be
rather
exciting
remember
said
dahlia
i
not
so
expert
as
you
are
of
course
said
myra
we
the
oberland
mixed
champions
you
know
said
archie
i
was
talking
to
the
man
who
doing
boots
and
he
said
the
snow
would
be
bad
for
if
he
talked
in
french
no
doubt
you
misunderstood
him
i
said
a
little
annoyed
he
was
probably
asking
you
to
buy
a
pair
of
skates
talking
about
that
said
archie
why
should
we
skate
this
morning
and
have
lunch
at
the
hotel
and
then
get
the
bob
out
this
afternoon
here
you
are
said
thomas
coming
up
with
a
heavy
rucksack
lunch
for
six
so
you
have
an
extra
one
i
forgotten
about
lunch
said
archie
look
here
just
talk
it
over
with
dahlia
while
i
go
and
see
about
my
skates
i
do
suppose
josef
will
mind
if
we
do
stay
in
to
lunch
after
all
what
about
simpson
i
looked
at
myra
and
sighed
what
about
him
i
said
half
an
hour
later
two
exhausted
people
one
of
them
with
lunch
for
six
on
his
back
began
the
ascent
to
the
wood
trailing
their
skis
behind
them
another
moment
said
myra
and
i
should
have
screamed
thomas
and
a
turn
myra
finished
her
orange
dried
her
hands
daintily
on
my
handkerchief
and
spoke
her
mind
this
is
the
third
time
she
said
that
thomas
has
given
us
the
slip
if
he
gets
engaged
to
that
girl
in
red
i
shall
cry
there
are
i
said
idly
throwing
a
crust
at
simpson
and
missing
him
engagements
and
swiss
engagements
just
as
there
are
measles
and
german
measles
it
is
well
known
that
swiss
engagements
do
count
got
engaged
in
kent
a
bit
of
luck
i
have
nothing
against
miss
aylwyn
i
went
on
except
the
way
she
does
her
hair
but
she
does
strike
me
as
being
the
essential
rabbit
we
can
not
admit
her
to
the
er
fold
the
covey
suggested
myra
the
warren
anyhow
she
simpson
for
goodness
sake
stop
fooling
about
with
your
bearded
friend
and
tell
us
what
you
think
of
it
all
we
were
finishing
lunch
in
the
lee
of
a
little
chalet
high
above
the
hotel
and
simpson
had
picked
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
goat
which
he
was
apparently
trying
to
conciliate
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
the
goat
however
seemed
to
want
a
piece
of
simpson
my
dear
old
chap
he
wo
go
away
here
shoo
shoo
i
wish
i
knew
what
his
name
was
ernest
said
myra
i
ca
think
why
you
ever
got
into
such
a
hirsute
set
simpson
he
probably
wants
your
compass
give
it
to
him
and
let
him
withdraw
ernest
having
decided
that
simpson
was
not
worth
knowing
withdrew
and
we
resumed
our
conversation
when
we
elderly
married
folk
have
retired
i
went
on
and
you
gay
young
bachelors
sit
up
over
a
last
cigar
to
discuss
your
conquests
has
not
thomas
unbent
to
you
samuel
and
told
you
of
his
hopes
and
fears
he
told
me
last
night
he
was
afraid
he
was
going
bald
and
he
said
he
hoped
he
was
that
a
bad
sign
said
myra
what
did
you
say
i
said
i
thought
he
was
with
some
difficulty
i
got
up
from
my
seat
in
the
snow
and
buckled
on
my
skis
come
on
let
forget
thomas
for
a
bit
samuel
is
now
going
to
show
us
the
christiania
turn
simpson
all
eagerness
began
to
prepare
himself
i
said
i
would
did
i
i
was
doing
it
quite
well
yesterday
this
is
a
perfect
little
slope
for
it
you
understand
the
theory
of
it
you
we
hope
to
after
the
exhibition
well
the
great
thing
is
to
lean
the
opposite
way
to
the
way
you
think
you
ought
to
lean
that
what
so
difficult
you
understand
myra
samuel
will
lean
the
opposite
way
to
what
he
thinks
he
ought
to
lean
tell
ernest
but
suppose
you
think
you
ought
to
lean
the
way
the
way
they
do
in
christiania
said
myra
and
you
lean
the
opposite
way
then
what
happens
that
is
what
samuel
will
probably
show
us
i
said
simpson
was
now
ready
i
am
going
to
turn
to
the
left
he
said
watch
carefully
of
course
i
may
not
bring
it
off
the
first
time
i
ca
help
thinking
you
will
said
myra
it
depends
what
you
call
bringing
it
off
i
said
we
have
every
hope
of
i
mean
we
do
think
our
money
will
be
wasted
have
you
got
the
and
the
peppermints
and
the
programme
darling
then
you
may
begin
samuel
simpson
started
down
the
slope
a
little
unsteadily
for
one
moment
i
feared
that
there
might
be
an
accident
before
the
real
accident
but
he
recovered
himself
nobly
and
sped
to
the
bottom
then
a
cloud
of
snow
shot
up
and
for
quite
a
long
time
there
was
no
simpson
i
knew
he
would
disappoint
us
gurgled
myra
we
slid
down
to
him
and
helped
him
up
you
see
the
idea
he
said
i
afraid
i
spoilt
it
a
little
at
that
end
but
my
dear
samuel
you
improved
it
out
of
all
knowledge
but
that
actually
the
christiania
turn
oh
do
we
live
in
christiania
exclaimed
myra
to
me
could
we
possibly
afford
it
it
must
be
a
happy
town
i
agreed
how
the
old
streets
must
ring
and
ring
again
with
jovial
laughter
shall
i
do
it
once
more
you
said
myra
clasping
her
hands
eagerly
wait
here
said
samuel
and
i
do
it
quite
close
to
you
myra
unstrapped
her
camera
half
an
hour
later
with
several
excellent
films
of
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
we
started
for
home
it
was
more
than
a
little
steep
but
the
run
down
was
accomplished
without
any
serious
trouble
simpson
went
first
to
discover
any
hidden
ditches
and
to
his
credit
be
it
said
that
he
invariably
discovered
them
myra
in
the
position
of
safety
in
the
middle
profited
by
samuel
frequent
while
i
at
the
back
was
ready
to
help
myra
up
if
need
arose
or
to
repel
any
avalanche
which
descended
on
us
from
above
on
the
level
snow
at
the
bottom
we
became
more
companionable
we
still
have
settled
the
great
thomas
question
said
myra
what
about
why
bother
about
latin
but
the
great
tailing
expedition
is
for
the
horses
are
ordered
everything
is
prepared
only
one
thing
remains
to
settle
shall
we
have
with
us
a
grumpy
but
aylwynless
thomas
or
shall
we
let
him
bring
her
and
spoil
the
party
she
ca
spoil
the
party
i
here
to
enjoy
myself
and
all
ca
stop
me
let
have
thomas
happy
anyway
she
really
quite
a
nice
girl
said
simpson
i
danced
with
her
once
then
i
tell
dahlia
to
invite
her
we
hurried
on
to
the
hotel
but
as
we
passed
the
rink
the
president
stopped
me
for
a
chat
he
wanted
me
to
recite
at
a
concert
that
evening
basely
deserted
by
myra
and
samuel
i
told
him
that
i
did
not
recite
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
adding
that
personally
i
did
think
anybody
else
ought
to
i
had
just
persuaded
him
to
my
point
of
view
when
i
noticed
thomas
cutting
remarkable
figures
on
the
ice
he
picked
himself
up
and
skated
to
the
side
hallo
he
said
had
a
good
day
splendid
what
have
you
been
doing
oh
skating
i
say
about
this
tailing
expedition
er
yes
i
was
just
going
to
talk
about
that
well
it
all
right
myra
is
getting
dahlia
to
ask
her
to
come
with
us
good
said
thomas
brightening
up
you
see
we
shall
only
be
seven
even
with
miss
aylwyn
and
miss
said
thomas
in
a
hollow
voice
yes
is
that
the
name
of
your
friend
in
red
oh
one
oh
but
that
quite
i
mean
he
went
on
hurriedly
miss
aylwyn
is
probably
booked
up
for
it
miss
cardew
who
is
so
keen
on
tailing
that
girl
in
green
you
know
for
a
moment
i
stared
at
him
blankly
then
i
left
him
and
dashed
after
myra
a
tailing
party
the
procession
prepared
to
start
in
the
following
order
a
brace
of
horses
gaspard
the
last
of
the
bandits
or
why
cause
a
lot
of
talk
by
pushing
your
rich
uncle
over
the
cliff
when
you
can
have
him
stabbed
quietly
for
one
franc
fifty
if
ever
i
were
in
any
vendetta
business
i
should
pick
gaspard
first
a
sleigh
full
of
lunch
a
few
ladies
and
gentlemen
being
the
cream
of
the
hôtel
des
angéliques
on
luges
namely
reading
from
left
to
right
which
is
really
the
best
method
unless
you
are
translating
hebrew
simpson
archie
dahlia
myra
me
miss
cardew
and
thomas
while
gaspard
was
putting
the
finishing
knots
to
the
luges
i
addressed
a
few
remarks
to
miss
cardew
fearing
that
she
might
be
feeling
a
little
lonely
amongst
us
i
said
that
it
was
a
lovely
day
and
did
she
think
the
snow
would
hold
off
till
evening
also
had
she
ever
done
this
sort
of
thing
before
i
forget
what
her
answers
were
thomas
meanwhile
was
exchanging
badinage
on
the
hotel
steps
with
miss
aylwyn
there
must
be
something
peculiar
in
the
swiss
air
for
in
england
thomas
is
quite
a
respectable
man
and
a
godfather
i
suppose
we
asked
the
right
one
said
myra
doubtfully
his
young
affections
are
divided
there
was
a
third
girl
in
pink
with
whom
he
breakfasted
a
lot
this
morning
it
is
the
old
tradition
of
the
sea
you
know
a
sailor
i
mean
an
admiralty
civilian
has
a
wife
at
every
wireless
station
take
your
seats
please
said
archie
the
horses
are
sick
of
waiting
we
sat
down
archie
took
dahlia
feet
on
his
lap
myra
took
mine
miss
cardew
took
thomas
simpson
alone
in
front
nursed
a
avant
cried
simpson
in
his
best
accent
gaspard
muttered
an
oath
to
his
animals
they
pulled
bravely
the
rope
snapped
and
they
trotted
gaily
down
the
hill
with
gaspard
we
hurried
after
them
with
the
luges
it
a
good
joke
said
archie
after
this
had
happened
three
times
but
personally
i
weary
of
it
miss
cardew
i
afraid
we
brought
you
out
under
false
pretences
thomas
did
explain
the
thing
to
you
adequately
he
gave
you
to
understand
that
there
was
more
in
it
than
this
gaspard
who
seemed
full
of
rope
produced
a
fourth
piece
and
tied
a
knot
that
made
even
simpson
envious
now
samuel
i
begged
do
keep
the
line
taut
this
time
why
do
you
suppose
we
put
your
apricot
suit
right
in
the
front
is
it
do
you
suppose
for
the
sunset
effects
at
eleven
in
the
morning
or
is
it
that
you
may
look
after
the
rope
properly
i
awfully
sorry
miss
cardew
said
simpson
feeling
that
somebody
ought
to
apologize
for
something
and
knowing
that
gaspard
would
but
i
expect
it
will
be
all
right
now
we
settled
down
again
once
more
gaspard
cursed
his
horses
and
once
more
they
started
off
bravely
and
this
time
we
went
with
them
the
idea
all
along
i
explained
to
miss
cardew
i
rather
suspected
it
she
said
apparently
she
has
a
suspicious
mind
after
the
little
descent
at
the
start
we
went
uphill
slowly
for
a
couple
of
miles
and
then
more
rapidly
over
the
level
we
had
driven
over
the
same
road
in
a
sleigh
coming
from
the
station
and
had
been
bitterly
cold
and
extremely
bored
why
our
present
position
should
be
so
much
more
enjoyable
i
did
quite
see
it
the
expectation
of
an
accident
said
archie
at
any
moment
somebody
may
fall
off
good
my
dear
old
chap
said
simpson
turning
round
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
why
anybody
fall
off
we
went
suddenly
round
a
corner
and
quietly
and
without
any
fuss
whatever
simpson
left
his
luge
and
rolled
on
to
the
track
luckily
any
possibility
of
a
further
accident
was
at
once
avoided
there
was
no
panic
at
all
archie
kicked
the
body
temporarily
out
of
the
way
after
which
dahlia
leant
over
and
pushed
it
thoughtfully
to
the
side
of
the
road
myra
warded
it
off
with
a
leg
as
she
neared
it
with
both
hands
i
helped
it
into
the
deep
snow
from
which
it
had
shown
a
tendency
to
emerge
miss
cardew
put
a
foot
out
at
it
for
safety
and
thomas
patted
it
gently
on
the
head
as
the
end
of
the
tail
went
past
as
soon
as
we
had
recovered
our
powers
of
speech
all
except
miss
cardew
who
was
in
hysterics
we
called
upon
gaspard
to
stop
he
indicated
with
the
back
of
his
neck
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
stop
just
then
and
it
was
not
until
we
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
nearly
a
mile
from
the
place
where
simpson
left
us
that
the
procession
halted
and
gave
itself
up
again
to
laughter
i
hope
he
is
not
hurt
said
dahlia
wiping
the
tears
from
her
eyes
he
would
spoil
a
good
joke
like
that
by
getting
hurt
said
myra
confidently
he
much
too
much
of
a
sportsman
why
did
he
do
it
said
thomas
he
suddenly
remembered
he
had
packed
his
he
back
to
the
hotel
by
now
miss
cardew
remained
in
hysterics
ten
minutes
later
a
brilliant
sunset
was
observed
approaching
from
the
north
a
little
later
it
was
seen
to
be
a
large
dish
of
apricots
and
cream
he
draws
near
said
archie
now
then
let
be
stern
with
him
at
twenty
yards
range
simpson
began
to
talk
his
trot
had
heated
him
slightly
i
say
he
said
excitedly
you
myra
shook
her
head
at
him
not
done
samuel
she
said
reproachfully
not
what
myra
what
not
you
ought
to
leave
us
like
that
without
telling
us
after
all
said
archie
we
are
all
one
party
and
we
are
supposed
to
keep
together
if
you
prefer
to
go
about
by
yourself
that
all
right
but
if
we
go
to
the
trouble
of
arranging
something
for
the
whole
party
you
might
have
caused
a
very
nasty
accident
i
pointed
out
if
you
were
in
a
hurry
you
had
only
to
say
a
word
to
gaspard
and
he
would
have
stopped
for
you
to
alight
now
i
begin
to
understand
why
you
kept
cutting
the
rope
at
the
start
you
have
sent
miss
cardew
into
hysterics
by
your
conduct
said
dahlia
miss
cardew
gave
another
peal
simpson
looked
at
her
in
dismay
i
say
miss
cardew
i
most
awfully
sorry
i
really
did
i
say
dahlia
he
went
on
confidentially
ought
we
to
do
something
about
this
rub
her
feet
with
snow
or
i
mean
i
know
there
you
do
when
people
have
hysterics
it
rather
serious
if
they
go
on
you
burn
feathers
under
their
nose
he
began
to
feel
in
his
pockets
i
wonder
if
gaspard
got
a
feather
with
a
great
effort
miss
cardew
pulled
herself
together
it
all
right
thank
you
she
said
in
a
stifled
voice
then
let
get
on
said
archie
we
resumed
our
seats
once
more
archie
took
dahlia
feet
on
his
lap
myra
took
mine
miss
cardew
took
thomas
simpson
clung
tight
to
his
luge
with
both
hands
right
cried
archie
gaspard
swore
at
his
horses
they
pulled
bravely
the
rope
snapped
and
they
trotted
gaily
up
the
hill
with
gaspard
we
hurried
after
them
with
the
luges
a
happy
ending
for
our
last
night
they
might
at
least
have
had
a
dance
said
myra
even
if
there
was
no
public
presentation
as
we
had
hoped
i
admitted
what
is
a
gymkhana
anyway
asked
thomas
a
few
little
competitions
said
archie
one
must
cater
for
the
chaperons
sometimes
you
are
all
entered
for
the
and
the
dahlia
thought
it
would
amuse
you
at
cambridge
i
said
reminiscently
i
once
blew
the
feather
feet
inches
unfortunately
i
stepped
outside
the
circle
my
official
record
is
feet
did
you
ever
trim
a
hat
at
cambridge
asked
myra
because
you
got
to
do
one
for
me
i
had
not
expected
this
my
view
of
the
competition
had
been
that
should
have
to
provide
the
face
and
that
would
have
to
invent
some
suitable
frame
for
it
i
full
of
ideas
i
lied
nine
found
a
small
row
of
us
prepared
to
blow
the
feather
the
presidential
instructions
were
that
we
had
to
race
our
feather
across
a
at
the
end
of
the
room
anybody
touching
his
feather
to
be
disqualified
in
the
air
or
on
the
floor
asked
simpson
earnestly
just
as
you
like
said
the
president
kindly
and
came
round
with
the
bag
i
selected
percy
with
care
a
dear
little
feather
about
half
an
inch
long
and
of
a
delicate
colour
i
should
have
known
him
again
anywhere
go
said
the
president
i
was
rather
excited
with
the
result
that
my
first
blow
was
much
too
powerful
for
percy
he
shot
up
to
the
ceiling
and
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
seemed
inclined
to
stay
there
anxiously
i
waited
below
with
my
mouth
open
he
came
slowly
down
at
last
and
in
my
eagerness
i
played
my
second
just
a
shade
too
soon
it
missed
him
my
third
when
i
was
ready
for
it
went
harmlessly
over
his
head
a
frantic
fourth
and
fifth
helped
him
downwards
and
in
another
moment
my
beautiful
percy
was
on
the
floor
i
dropped
on
my
knees
and
played
my
sixth
vigorously
he
swirled
to
the
left
i
was
after
him
like
a
shot
and
crashed
into
thomas
we
rolled
over
in
a
heap
sorry
we
apologized
as
we
got
back
on
to
our
hands
and
knees
thomas
went
on
blowing
where
my
feather
i
said
thomas
was
now
two
yards
ahead
blowing
like
anything
a
terrible
suspicion
darted
through
my
mind
thomas
i
said
you
got
my
feather
he
made
no
answer
i
scrambled
after
him
that
percy
i
said
i
should
know
him
anywhere
you
blowing
percy
it
very
bad
form
to
blow
another
man
feather
if
it
got
about
you
would
be
cut
by
the
county
give
me
back
my
feather
thomas
how
do
you
know
it
your
feather
he
said
truculently
feathers
are
just
alike
how
do
i
know
i
asked
in
amazement
a
feather
that
i
brought
up
from
the
egg
of
course
i
know
percy
i
leant
down
to
him
i
whispered
he
darted
forward
a
good
six
inches
you
see
i
said
he
knows
his
name
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
thomas
his
name
look
show
you
you
need
bother
thomas
i
said
hastily
this
is
mere
trifling
i
that
my
feather
i
remember
his
profile
distinctly
then
where
mine
how
do
i
know
you
may
have
swallowed
it
go
away
and
leave
percy
and
me
to
ourselves
you
only
spoiling
the
knees
of
your
trousers
by
staying
here
paul
and
i
began
thomas
he
was
interrupted
by
a
burst
of
applause
dahlia
had
cajoled
her
feather
over
the
line
first
thomas
rose
and
brushed
himself
you
can
him
he
said
there
i
said
as
i
picked
percy
up
and
placed
him
reverently
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
that
shows
that
he
was
mine
if
he
had
been
your
own
little
paul
you
would
have
loved
him
even
in
defeat
oh
musical
chairs
now
and
at
the
president
touch
i
retired
from
the
arena
we
had
not
entered
for
musical
chairs
personally
i
should
have
liked
to
but
it
was
felt
that
if
none
of
us
did
then
it
would
be
more
easy
to
stop
simpson
doing
so
for
at
musical
chairs
simpson
is
i
am
afraid
there
is
only
one
word
for
it
it
is
a
word
that
i
hesitate
to
use
but
the
truth
must
prevail
simpson
is
he
himself
he
plays
he
whenever
i
take
simpson
out
anywhere
i
always
whisper
to
my
hostess
musical
chairs
the
last
event
of
the
evening
was
the
competition
each
man
of
us
was
provided
with
five
large
sheets
of
coloured
crinkly
paper
a
packet
of
pins
a
pair
of
scissors
and
a
lady
opposite
to
him
have
you
any
plans
at
all
asked
myra
heaps
tell
me
what
sort
of
hat
would
you
like
something
for
the
park
i
doubled
up
a
piece
of
blue
paper
and
looked
at
it
you
know
if
this
is
a
success
myra
i
shall
often
make
your
hats
for
you
five
minutes
later
i
had
what
i
believe
is
called
a
foundation
anyhow
it
was
something
for
myra
to
put
her
head
into
our
very
latest
bond
street
model
said
myra
only
fifteen
guineas
or
if
you
buy
it
at
our
other
establishment
in
battersea
now
then
i
can
get
going
i
said
and
i
began
to
cut
out
a
white
feather
yes
your
ladyship
this
is
from
the
genuine
bird
on
our
own
ostrich
farm
in
the
fulham
road
plucked
while
the
ingenuous
biped
had
its
head
in
the
sand
i
shall
put
that
round
the
brim
and
i
pinned
it
round
what
about
a
few
roses
said
myra
fingering
the
red
paper
the
roses
are
going
there
on
the
right
i
pinned
them
on
and
a
and
some
violets
next
to
them
i
say
i
got
a
lot
of
paper
over
what
about
a
nice
piece
of
cabbage
there
and
a
bunch
of
asparagus
and
some
tomatoes
and
a
seagull
wing
on
the
left
the
back
still
looks
rather
bare
let
have
some
poppies
there
only
three
minutes
more
said
myra
and
you
have
used
all
the
paper
yet
i
got
about
one
william
allan
richardson
and
a
couple
of
canaries
over
i
said
after
examining
my
stock
let
put
it
inside
as
lining
there
myra
my
dear
i
proud
of
you
i
always
say
that
in
a
nice
quiet
hat
nobody
looks
prettier
than
you
time
said
the
president
anxious
matrons
prowled
round
us
we
do
know
any
of
the
judges
i
whispered
this
is
fair
the
matrons
conferred
with
the
president
he
cleared
his
throat
the
first
prize
he
said
goes
to
but
i
had
swooned
well
said
archie
the
rabbits
return
to
england
with
two
cups
won
on
the
snowfields
of
switzerland
nobody
need
know
said
myra
they
were
won
at
unless
i
have
first
prize
engraved
on
mine
i
said
as
i
had
rather
intended
then
i
shall
have
on
mine
said
dahlia
two
cups
reflected
archie
and
thomas
engaged
to
three
charming
girls
i
think
it
has
been
worth
it
you
know
a
baker
dozen
a
tragedy
in
little
the
great
question
of
the
day
is
what
will
become
of
sidney
whenever
i
think
of
him
now
the
unbidden
tear
wells
into
my
eye
and
wells
down
my
cheek
and
wells
on
to
my
collar
my
friends
think
i
have
a
cold
and
offer
me
lozenges
but
it
is
sidney
who
makes
me
weep
i
fear
that
i
am
about
to
lose
him
he
came
into
my
life
in
the
following
way
some
months
ago
i
wanted
to
buy
some
silk
stockings
not
for
myself
for
i
seldom
wear
them
but
for
a
sister
the
idea
came
suddenly
to
me
that
any
woman
with
a
brother
and
a
birthday
would
simply
love
the
one
to
give
her
silk
stockings
for
the
other
but
of
course
they
would
have
to
be
the
right
silk
stockings
the
fashionable
shape
for
the
year
the
correct
assortment
of
clocks
and
so
forth
then
as
to
material
could
i
be
sure
i
was
getting
silk
and
not
silkette
or
something
inferior
how
maddening
if
seeing
that
i
was
an
unprotected
man
they
palmed
off
jaeger
on
me
clearly
this
was
a
case
for
outside
assistance
so
i
called
in
celia
this
i
said
to
her
is
practically
the
only
subject
on
which
i
am
not
an
expert
at
the
same
time
i
have
a
distinct
feeling
for
silk
stockings
if
you
can
hurry
me
past
all
the
embarrassing
counters
safely
and
arrange
for
the
lady
behind
the
right
one
to
show
me
the
right
line
in
silken
hose
i
will
undertake
to
pick
out
half
a
dozen
pairs
that
would
melt
any
sister
heart
well
the
affair
went
off
perfectly
celia
took
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
and
behaved
just
as
if
i
were
buying
them
for
the
also
behaved
as
if
i
were
fortunately
i
kept
my
head
when
it
came
to
giving
the
name
and
address
no
i
said
firmly
to
celia
not
yours
my
sister
and
i
dragged
her
away
to
tea
now
whether
it
was
because
celia
had
particularly
enjoyed
her
afternoon
or
because
she
felt
that
a
man
who
was
as
ignorant
as
i
about
silk
stockings
must
lead
a
very
lonely
life
or
because
i
had
mentioned
casually
and
erroneously
that
it
was
my
own
birthday
that
week
i
can
not
say
but
on
the
following
morning
i
received
a
little
box
with
a
note
on
the
outside
which
said
in
her
handwriting
something
for
you
be
kind
to
him
and
i
opened
it
and
found
sidney
he
was
a
japanese
the
merest
boy
at
eighty
or
ninety
according
to
the
photographs
he
would
be
a
stalwart
fellow
with
thick
bark
on
his
trunk
and
or
acorns
or
whatever
was
his
speciality
hanging
all
over
him
just
at
present
he
was
barely
ten
i
had
only
eighty
years
to
wait
before
he
reached
his
prime
naturally
i
decided
to
lavish
all
my
care
upon
his
upbringing
i
would
water
him
after
breakfast
every
morning
and
when
i
remembered
it
at
night
if
there
was
any
he
particularly
fancied
he
should
have
it
if
he
had
any
dead
leaves
to
snip
off
i
would
snip
them
it
was
at
this
moment
that
i
discovered
something
else
in
the
box
a
card
of
instructions
i
have
not
got
it
now
and
i
have
forgotten
the
actual
wording
but
the
spirit
of
it
was
this
hints
on
the
proper
rearing
and
of
a
japanese
the
life
of
this
tree
is
a
precarious
one
and
if
it
is
to
be
successfully
brought
to
manhood
the
following
rules
must
be
carefully
observed
i
this
tree
requires
above
all
else
fresh
air
and
exercise
ii
whenever
the
sun
is
shining
the
tree
should
be
placed
outside
in
a
position
where
it
can
absorb
the
rays
iii
whenever
the
rain
is
raining
it
should
be
placed
outside
in
a
position
where
it
can
absorb
the
wet
iv
it
should
be
taken
out
for
a
trot
at
least
once
every
day
it
simply
loathes
artificial
light
and
artificial
heat
if
you
keep
it
in
your
see
that
it
is
situated
as
far
as
possible
from
the
chandelier
and
the
vi
it
also
detests
noise
do
not
place
it
on
the
top
of
the
pianola
vii
it
loves
moonlight
leave
it
outside
when
you
go
to
bed
in
case
the
moon
should
come
out
viii
on
the
other
hand
it
hates
lightning
cover
it
up
with
the
canary
cloth
when
the
lightning
begins
ix
if
it
shows
signs
of
drooping
a
course
of
massage
will
generally
bring
it
round
x
but
in
no
case
offer
it
buns
well
i
read
these
instructions
carefully
and
saw
at
once
that
i
should
have
to
hand
over
the
business
of
rearing
sidney
to
another
i
have
my
living
to
earn
the
same
as
anybody
else
and
i
should
never
get
any
work
done
at
all
if
i
had
constantly
to
be
rushing
home
from
the
office
on
the
plea
that
it
was
time
for
master
sidney
so
i
called
up
my
housekeeper
and
placed
the
matter
before
her
i
said
let
me
introduce
you
to
sidney
he
is
very
dear
to
me
dearer
to
me
than
a
a
brother
no
on
second
thoughts
my
brother
is
perhaps
well
anyhow
sidney
is
very
dear
to
me
i
will
show
my
trust
in
you
by
asking
you
to
tend
him
for
me
here
are
a
few
notes
about
his
health
frankly
he
is
delicate
but
the
doctors
have
hope
with
care
they
think
he
may
live
to
be
a
his
future
is
in
your
hands
my
housekeeper
thanked
me
for
this
mark
of
esteem
and
took
the
card
of
instructions
away
with
her
i
asked
her
for
it
a
week
afterwards
and
it
appeared
that
having
committed
the
rules
to
memory
she
had
lost
it
but
that
she
follows
the
instructions
i
have
no
doubt
and
certainly
she
and
sidney
understand
each
other
ways
exactly
automatically
she
gives
him
his
bath
his
massage
his
run
in
the
park
when
it
rains
or
snows
or
shines
she
knows
exactly
what
to
do
with
sidney
but
as
a
consequence
i
see
little
of
him
i
suppose
it
must
always
be
so
we
parents
must
make
these
sacrifices
for
our
children
think
of
a
mother
only
seeing
her
for
fifteen
weeks
a
year
through
the
long
period
of
his
schooling
and
think
of
me
doomed
to
catch
only
the
most
casual
glimpses
of
sidney
until
he
is
ninety
for
you
know
i
might
almost
say
that
i
never
see
him
at
all
now
as
i
go
to
my
work
i
may
if
i
am
lucky
get
a
fleeting
glance
of
him
on
the
tiles
where
he
sits
drinking
in
the
rain
or
sun
in
the
evening
when
i
return
he
is
either
out
in
the
moonlight
or
if
indoors
shunning
the
artificial
light
with
the
cloth
over
his
head
indeed
the
only
times
when
i
really
see
him
to
talk
to
are
when
celia
comes
to
tea
with
me
then
my
housekeeper
hurries
him
in
from
his
walk
or
his
and
puts
him
brushed
and
manicured
on
my
desk
and
celia
and
i
whisper
fond
nothings
to
him
i
believe
celia
thinks
he
lives
there
as
i
began
by
saying
i
weep
for
sidney
approaching
end
for
my
housekeeper
leaves
this
week
a
new
one
takes
her
place
how
will
she
treat
my
poor
sidney
the
old
card
of
instructions
is
lost
what
can
i
give
her
in
its
place
the
legend
that
sidney
is
a
precious
life
that
he
must
have
his
morning
bath
his
run
his
glass
of
hot
water
after
meals
she
would
laugh
at
it
besides
she
may
not
be
at
all
the
sort
of
for
a
japanese
it
will
break
my
heart
if
sidney
dies
now
for
i
had
so
looked
forward
to
celebrating
his
ninetieth
birthday
with
him
it
will
hurt
celia
too
but
grief
of
course
will
be
an
inferior
affair
in
fact
a
couple
of
pairs
of
silk
stockings
will
help
her
to
forget
him
altogether
the
financier
i
this
is
how
i
became
a
west
african
mining
magnate
with
a
stake
in
the
empire
during
february
i
grew
suddenly
tired
of
waiting
for
the
summer
to
begin
london
in
the
summer
is
a
pleasant
place
and
chiefly
so
because
you
can
keep
on
buying
evening
papers
to
see
what
kent
is
doing
in
february
life
has
no
such
excitements
to
offer
so
i
wrote
to
my
solicitor
about
it
i
want
you
i
wrote
to
buy
me
fifty
rubber
shares
so
that
i
can
watch
them
go
up
and
down
and
i
added
brokerage
to
show
that
i
knew
what
i
was
talking
about
he
replied
tersely
as
follows
do
be
a
fool
if
you
have
any
money
to
invest
i
can
get
you
a
safe
mortgage
at
five
per
cent
let
me
know
it
a
funny
thing
how
the
minds
of
solicitors
run
upon
mortgages
if
they
would
only
stop
to
think
for
a
moment
they
would
see
that
you
could
possibly
watch
a
safe
mortgage
go
up
and
down
i
left
my
solicitor
alone
and
consulted
henry
on
the
subject
in
the
intervals
between
golf
and
golf
henry
dabbles
in
finance
you
do
want
anything
i
gather
he
said
it
wonderful
how
they
talk
i
want
it
to
go
up
and
down
i
explained
patiently
and
i
indicated
the
required
movement
with
my
umbrella
what
about
a
little
flutter
in
oil
he
went
on
just
like
a
financier
in
a
novel
i
have
a
little
flutter
in
raspberry
jam
if
you
like
anything
as
long
as
i
can
rush
every
night
for
the
last
edition
of
the
evening
papers
and
say
now
and
then
heavens
i
ruined
then
you
better
try
a
said
henry
bitterly
in
the
voice
of
one
who
had
tried
take
your
choice
and
he
threw
the
paper
over
to
me
i
do
want
a
whole
mine
only
a
vein
or
two
yes
this
is
very
interesting
i
went
on
as
i
got
among
the
west
africans
the
scoring
seems
to
be
pretty
low
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
a
wet
wicket
reef
he
did
a
little
better
in
the
second
innings
boffin
river
they
followed
on
you
see
but
they
saved
the
innings
defeat
by
the
way
which
figure
do
i
really
keep
my
eye
on
when
i
want
to
watch
them
go
up
and
down
both
one
eye
on
each
and
do
talk
about
boffin
river
to
me
is
it
like
that
henry
i
am
sorry
i
suppose
it
too
late
now
to
offer
you
a
safe
mortgage
at
five
per
cent
i
know
a
man
who
has
some
well
perhaps
you
right
on
the
next
day
i
became
a
magnate
the
jaguar
mine
was
the
one
i
fixed
upon
for
two
reasons
first
the
figure
immediately
after
it
was
which
struck
me
as
a
good
point
from
which
to
watch
it
go
up
and
down
secondly
i
met
a
man
at
lunch
who
knew
somebody
who
had
actually
seen
the
jaguar
mine
he
says
that
there
no
doubt
about
there
being
lots
there
lots
of
what
jaguars
or
gold
ah
he
did
say
perhaps
he
meant
jaguars
anyhow
it
was
an
even
chance
and
i
decided
to
risk
it
in
a
time
i
was
the
owner
of
what
we
call
in
the
city
a
block
of
jaguars
bought
from
one
herbert
bellingham
who
i
suppose
had
been
got
at
by
his
solicitor
and
compelled
to
return
to
something
safe
i
was
a
west
african
magnate
my
first
two
months
as
a
magnate
were
a
great
success
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
would
tear
open
the
financial
editions
of
the
evening
papers
to
find
one
day
that
jaguars
had
soared
like
a
rocket
to
the
next
that
they
had
dropped
like
a
stone
to
there
was
one
terrible
afternoon
when
for
some
reason
which
will
never
be
properly
explained
we
sank
to
i
think
the
european
situation
had
something
to
do
with
it
though
this
naturally
is
not
admitted
lord
rothschild
i
fancy
suddenly
threw
all
his
jaguars
on
the
market
he
sold
and
sold
and
sold
and
only
held
his
hand
when
in
desperation
the
tsar
granted
the
concession
for
his
new
southend
to
siberia
railway
something
like
that
but
he
never
recked
how
the
private
investor
would
suffer
and
there
was
i
sitting
at
home
and
sending
out
madly
for
all
the
papers
until
my
rooms
were
littered
with
copies
of
financial
feathered
and
next
day
we
were
up
to
and
i
was
able
to
breathe
again
but
i
had
other
pleasures
than
these
previously
i
had
regarded
the
city
with
awe
but
now
i
felt
a
glow
of
possession
come
over
me
whenever
i
approached
it
often
in
those
first
two
months
i
used
to
lean
against
the
mansion
house
in
a
familiar
sort
of
way
once
i
struck
a
match
against
the
royal
exchange
and
what
an
impression
of
financial
acumen
i
could
make
in
a
by
a
careless
reference
to
my
block
of
jaguars
even
those
who
misunderstood
me
and
thought
i
spoke
of
my
flock
of
jaguars
were
startled
indeed
life
was
very
good
just
then
but
lately
things
have
not
been
going
well
at
the
beginning
of
april
jaguars
settled
down
at
though
i
stood
for
hours
at
the
club
tape
my
hair
standing
up
on
end
and
my
eyeballs
starting
from
their
sockets
jaguars
still
came
through
steadily
at
to
give
them
a
chance
of
doing
something
i
left
them
alone
for
a
whole
week
with
what
agony
you
can
imagine
then
i
looked
again
a
whole
week
and
anything
might
have
happened
pauper
or
millionaire
no
still
worse
was
to
follow
editors
actually
took
to
leaving
out
jaguars
altogether
i
suppose
they
were
sick
of
putting
in
every
edition
but
how
ridiculous
it
made
my
idea
seem
of
watching
them
go
up
and
down
how
blank
life
became
again
and
now
what
i
dreaded
most
of
all
has
happened
i
have
received
a
progress
report
from
the
mine
it
gives
the
total
footage
for
the
month
special
reference
being
made
to
winzing
and
sinking
the
amount
of
tons
crushed
is
announced
there
is
serious
talk
of
ore
being
extracted
indeed
there
has
already
been
a
most
alarming
yield
in
fine
gold
in
short
it
can
no
longer
be
hushed
up
that
the
property
may
at
any
moment
be
placed
on
a
basis
probably
i
shall
be
getting
a
safe
five
per
cent
dash
it
all
as
i
said
to
my
solicitor
this
morning
i
might
just
as
well
have
bought
a
rotten
mortgage
the
financier
ii
months
it
is
nearly
two
years
ago
that
i
began
speculating
in
west
african
mines
you
may
remember
what
a
stir
my
entry
into
the
financial
world
created
how
sir
isaac
isaacstein
went
mad
and
shot
himself
how
sir
samuel
samuelstein
went
mad
and
shot
his
typist
and
how
sir
moses
mosestein
went
mad
and
shot
his
typewriter
permanently
damaging
the
letter
there
was
panic
in
the
city
on
that
february
day
in
when
i
bought
jaguars
and
set
the
market
rocking
i
bought
jaguars
partly
for
the
rise
and
partly
for
the
thrill
in
describing
my
speculation
to
you
eighteen
months
ago
i
dwelt
chiefly
on
the
thrill
part
i
alleged
that
i
wanted
to
see
them
go
up
and
down
it
would
have
been
more
accurate
to
have
said
that
i
wanted
to
see
them
go
up
it
was
because
i
was
sure
they
were
going
up
that
with
the
united
support
of
my
solicitor
my
stockbroker
my
land
agent
my
doctor
my
architect
and
my
vicar
most
of
them
hired
for
the
occasion
i
bought
fifty
shares
in
the
jaguar
mine
of
west
africa
when
i
bought
jaguars
they
were
at
this
means
that
no
on
second
thoughts
i
wo
there
was
a
time
when
in
the
pride
of
my
new
knowledge
i
should
have
insisted
on
explaining
to
you
what
it
meant
but
i
am
getting
now
besides
you
probably
know
it
is
enough
that
i
bought
them
and
bought
them
on
the
distinct
understanding
from
my
financial
adviser
that
by
the
end
of
the
month
they
would
be
up
to
in
that
case
i
should
have
made
rather
more
than
forty
pounds
in
a
few
days
simply
by
assembling
together
my
solicitor
stockbroker
in
london
and
without
going
to
west
africa
at
all
a
wonderful
thought
at
the
end
of
a
month
jaguars
were
steady
at
and
i
had
received
a
report
from
the
mine
to
the
effect
that
down
below
they
were
simply
hacking
gold
out
as
fast
as
they
could
hack
and
up
at
the
top
were
very
busy
rinsing
and
washing
and
sponging
and
drying
it
the
next
month
the
situation
was
the
same
jaguars
in
london
very
steady
at
jaguar
diggers
in
west
africa
very
steady
at
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
month
i
realized
not
only
that
i
was
not
going
to
have
any
thrills
at
all
but
even
worse
that
i
was
not
going
to
make
any
money
at
all
i
had
been
deceived
that
was
where
eighteen
months
ago
i
left
the
story
of
my
city
life
a
good
deal
has
happened
since
then
as
a
result
of
which
i
am
once
more
eagerly
watching
the
price
of
jaguars
a
month
or
two
after
i
had
written
about
them
jaguars
began
to
go
down
they
did
it
as
they
have
done
everything
since
i
have
known
them
stupidly
if
they
had
dropped
in
a
single
night
to
i
should
at
least
have
had
my
thrill
i
should
have
suffered
in
a
single
night
the
loss
of
some
pounds
and
i
could
have
borne
it
dramatically
either
with
the
sternness
of
the
silent
saxon
or
else
with
the
volubility
of
the
volatile
i
ca
think
of
anybody
beginning
with
a
but
alas
jaguars
never
dropped
at
all
they
subsided
they
subsided
slowly
back
to
so
slowly
that
you
could
hardly
observe
them
going
a
week
later
they
were
which
of
course
is
practically
the
same
as
a
month
afterwards
they
were
and
it
is
a
debatable
point
whether
that
is
less
or
more
than
anyhow
by
the
time
i
had
worked
it
out
and
decided
that
it
was
slightly
less
they
were
at
and
one
had
the
same
trouble
all
over
again
at
i
left
them
for
a
time
and
when
i
next
read
the
financial
column
they
were
at
which
still
seemed
to
be
fairly
near
to
and
even
when
at
last
after
many
months
i
found
them
down
to
i
was
not
seriously
alarmed
but
felt
that
it
was
due
to
some
little
local
trouble
as
that
the
manager
had
fallen
down
the
main
shaft
and
was
preventing
the
gold
being
shot
out
properly
and
that
when
the
obstruction
had
been
removed
jaguars
would
go
up
to
again
but
they
did
they
continued
to
subside
when
they
had
subsided
to
i
woke
up
my
dream
of
financial
glory
was
over
i
had
lost
my
money
and
my
faith
in
the
city
well
let
them
go
with
an
effort
i
washed
jaguars
out
of
my
mind
henceforward
they
were
nothing
to
me
and
then
months
after
andrew
came
on
the
scene
at
lunch
one
day
he
happened
to
mention
that
he
had
been
talking
to
his
broker
do
you
often
talk
to
your
broker
i
asked
in
admiration
it
sounded
so
magnificent
often
i
have
got
a
broker
to
talk
to
when
you
next
chat
to
yours
i
wish
you
lead
the
conversation
round
to
jaguars
and
see
what
he
says
why
have
you
got
some
yes
but
they
no
good
have
a
cigarette
wo
you
next
morning
to
my
amazement
i
got
a
telegram
from
andrew
can
get
you
ten
shillings
for
jaguars
wire
if
you
will
sell
and
how
many
it
was
really
a
shock
to
me
when
i
had
asked
andrew
to
mention
jaguars
to
his
broker
it
was
solely
in
the
hope
of
hearing
some
humorous
city
comment
on
their
futility
one
of
those
crisp
jests
for
which
the
stock
exchange
is
famous
i
had
no
idea
that
his
broker
might
like
to
buy
them
from
me
i
wired
back
sell
fifty
quick
next
day
he
told
me
he
had
sold
them
that
all
right
i
said
cheerfully
they
his
he
can
watch
them
go
up
and
down
when
do
i
get
my
pounds
to
save
pounds
from
the
wreck
was
wonderful
not
for
a
month
and
of
course
you
do
deliver
the
shares
till
then
what
do
you
mean
the
shares
i
asked
in
alarm
i
got
the
here
it
in
africa
or
somewhere
must
i
go
out
and
but
you
got
a
certificate
for
them
my
heart
sank
have
i
i
whispered
good
lord
i
wonder
where
it
is
i
went
home
and
looked
i
looked
for
two
days
i
searched
drawers
and
desks
and
and
safes
and
and
every
place
in
which
a
certificate
might
hide
it
was
no
good
i
went
back
to
andrew
i
was
calm
about
these
jaguars
i
said
casually
i
do
quite
understand
my
position
what
have
i
promised
to
do
and
can
they
put
me
in
prison
if
i
do
do
it
you
promised
to
sell
fifty
jaguars
to
a
man
called
stevens
by
the
middle
of
next
month
that
all
i
see
i
said
and
i
went
home
again
and
i
suppose
you
see
too
i
got
to
sell
fifty
jaguars
to
a
man
called
stevens
by
the
middle
of
next
month
although
i
really
have
fifty
fully
matured
ones
of
my
own
there
nothing
to
prove
it
and
they
are
so
suspicious
in
the
city
that
they
will
never
take
my
bare
word
so
i
shall
have
to
buy
fifty
new
jaguars
for
this
man
called
stevens
and
buy
them
by
the
middle
of
next
month
and
this
is
why
i
am
still
eagerly
watching
the
price
of
jaguars
yesterday
they
were
i
am
hoping
that
by
the
middle
of
next
month
they
will
be
down
to
again
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
remember
sometimes
which
way
i
want
them
to
go
this
afternoon
for
instance
when
i
saw
they
had
risen
to
i
was
quite
excited
for
a
moment
i
went
out
and
bought
some
cigars
on
the
strength
of
it
then
i
remembered
and
i
came
home
and
almost
decided
to
sell
the
pianola
it
is
very
confusing
you
must
see
how
very
confusing
it
is
the
double
i
was
having
lunch
in
one
of
those
places
where
you
stand
and
eat
sandwiches
until
you
are
tired
and
then
try
to
count
up
how
many
you
have
had
as
the
charm
of
these
sandwiches
is
that
they
all
taste
exactly
alike
it
is
difficult
to
recall
each
individual
as
it
went
down
one
feels
too
after
the
last
sandwich
that
one
mind
would
more
willingly
dwell
upon
other
matters
personally
i
detest
the
whole
business
the
place
the
sandwiches
the
method
of
scoring
but
it
is
convenient
and
quick
and
i
can
not
keep
away
on
this
afternoon
i
was
giving
the
plate
a
turn
i
know
a
man
who
will
never
touch
because
of
the
cruelty
involved
in
the
preparation
of
it
i
excuse
myself
on
the
ground
that
my
own
sufferings
in
eating
these
sandwiches
are
much
greater
than
those
of
any
goose
in
providing
them
there
was
a
man
in
the
corner
who
kept
looking
at
me
i
seemed
to
myself
to
be
behaving
with
sufficient
propriety
and
there
was
nothing
in
my
clothes
or
appearance
to
invite
comment
for
in
the
working
quarter
of
london
a
high
standard
of
beauty
is
not
insisted
upon
on
the
next
occasion
when
i
caught
his
eye
i
frowned
at
him
and
a
moment
later
i
found
myself
trying
to
stare
him
down
after
two
minutes
it
was
i
who
retired
in
confusion
to
my
glass
as
i
prepared
to
go
for
to
be
watched
at
meals
makes
me
nervous
and
leads
me
sometimes
to
eat
the
card
with
foie
gras
on
it
in
mistake
for
the
sandwich
he
came
up
to
me
and
raised
his
hat
you
must
excuse
me
sir
for
staring
at
you
he
said
but
has
any
one
ever
told
you
that
you
are
exactly
like
e
barrett
i
drew
myself
up
and
rested
my
left
hand
lightly
on
my
hip
i
thought
he
said
david
garrick
the
very
image
of
him
he
went
on
when
first
i
met
him
something
told
me
that
in
spite
of
his
grey
hair
he
was
not
talking
of
david
garrick
after
all
like
i
said
in
some
disappointment
e
barrett
i
tried
to
think
of
a
reply
both
graceful
and
witty
the
only
one
i
could
think
of
was
oh
it
extraordinary
if
your
hair
were
just
a
little
longer
the
likeness
would
be
perfect
i
thought
of
offering
to
go
away
now
and
come
back
in
a
month
time
anyway
it
would
be
an
excuse
for
going
now
i
first
knew
him
at
cambridge
he
explained
we
were
up
together
in
the
ah
i
was
up
in
the
nineteen
hundreds
i
said
i
just
missed
you
both
well
did
they
ever
tell
you
at
cambridge
that
you
were
the
image
of
e
barrett
i
tried
to
think
they
had
told
me
lots
of
things
at
cambridge
but
i
could
remember
any
talk
about
barrett
i
should
have
thought
every
one
would
have
noticed
it
he
said
i
had
something
graceful
for
him
this
time
all
right
probably
i
said
those
who
were
unfortunate
enough
to
know
me
had
not
the
honour
of
knowing
e
barrett
but
everybody
knew
barrett
heard
of
him
of
course
the
dreadful
moment
had
arrived
i
knew
it
would
of
course
i
said
a
charming
fellow
very
brainy
i
agreed
well
just
ask
any
of
your
artist
friends
if
they
do
notice
the
likeness
the
nose
the
eyes
the
expression
wonderful
but
i
must
be
going
perhaps
i
shall
see
you
here
again
some
day
good
afternoon
and
he
raised
his
hat
and
left
me
you
can
understand
that
i
was
considerably
disturbed
first
why
had
i
never
heard
of
barrett
secondly
what
sort
of
looking
fellow
was
he
thirdly
with
all
this
talk
about
barrett
however
many
sandwiches
had
i
eaten
the
last
question
seemed
the
most
impossible
to
answer
so
i
said
eight
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
went
back
to
work
in
the
evening
i
called
upon
peter
my
acquaintance
of
the
afternoon
had
assumed
too
readily
that
i
should
allow
myself
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
artists
but
peter
wife
illustrates
books
and
they
both
talk
in
a
disparaging
way
of
our
greatest
academicians
who
i
began
at
once
as
i
shook
hands
did
i
remind
you
of
as
i
came
in
at
the
door
peter
was
silent
peter
feeling
that
some
answer
was
called
for
said
the
cat
no
no
now
i
come
in
again
i
went
out
and
returned
dramatically
now
then
tell
me
frankly
does
that
remind
you
of
barrett
entering
his
studio
who
is
e
barrett
i
was
amazed
at
their
ignorance
he
the
artist
you
heard
of
him
i
seem
to
know
the
name
lied
peter
what
did
he
paint
on
the
alps
corner
of
the
west
long
day
wanes
do
know
something
the
usual
thing
and
are
you
supposed
to
be
like
him
i
am
particularly
when
eating
sandwiches
is
it
worth
while
getting
you
some
in
order
to
observe
the
likeness
asked
peter
if
you
never
seen
barrett
i
fear
you
miss
the
likeness
even
in
the
most
favourable
circumstances
anyhow
you
must
have
heard
of
him
dear
old
a
they
were
utterly
ignorant
of
him
so
i
sat
down
and
told
them
what
i
knew
which
put
shortly
was
that
he
was
a
very
fellow
i
have
not
been
to
the
since
detesting
the
sandwiches
as
i
do
i
find
barrett
a
good
excuse
for
keeping
away
for
upon
the
day
after
that
when
he
came
into
my
life
i
had
a
sudden
cold
fear
that
the
thing
was
a
plant
how
in
what
way
i
can
not
imagine
that
i
am
to
be
sold
a
to
at
the
next
meeting
that
an
barrett
is
about
to
be
placed
on
the
market
that
an
offer
will
be
made
to
enlarge
my
photograph
or
barrett
free
of
charge
if
i
buy
the
frame
no
i
can
not
think
what
it
can
be
yet
after
all
why
should
it
be
a
plant
we
barretts
are
not
the
sort
of
men
to
be
mixed
up
with
fraud
impetuous
the
barrett
type
may
be
obstinate
jealous
so
much
you
see
in
our
features
but
dishonest
never
still
as
i
did
honestly
detest
those
last
eight
sandwiches
i
shall
stay
away
a
breath
of
life
this
is
the
story
of
a
comedy
which
nearly
became
a
tragedy
in
its
way
it
is
rather
a
pathetic
story
the
comedy
was
called
wooing
of
it
was
written
by
an
author
whose
name
i
forget
produced
by
the
and
as
his
has
often
told
us
popular
levinski
and
played
by
among
others
that
very
charming
young
man
prosper
vane
known
locally
as
alfred
briggs
until
he
took
to
the
stage
prosper
played
the
young
hero
who
was
actually
wooing
levinski
himself
took
the
part
of
a
man
of
the
world
with
a
slight
down
in
the
programme
as
geoffrey
but
fortunately
still
levinski
his
opening
words
as
he
came
on
were
ah
dick
i
have
a
note
for
you
somewhere
which
gave
the
audience
an
interval
in
which
to
welcome
him
while
he
felt
in
all
his
pockets
for
the
letter
one
can
bow
quite
easily
while
feeling
in
one
pockets
and
it
is
much
more
natural
than
stopping
in
the
middle
of
an
important
speech
in
order
to
acknowledge
any
cheers
the
realization
of
this
by
a
dramatist
is
what
is
called
stagecraft
in
this
case
the
audience
could
tell
at
once
that
the
technique
of
the
author
whose
name
unfortunately
i
forget
was
going
to
be
all
right
but
perhaps
i
had
better
describe
the
whole
play
as
shortly
as
possible
the
theme
as
one
guessed
from
the
title
even
before
the
curtain
rose
was
the
wooing
of
in
the
first
act
proposed
to
and
was
refused
by
her
not
from
lack
of
love
but
for
fear
lest
she
might
spoil
his
career
he
being
one
of
those
men
with
a
to
whom
the
open
spaces
of
the
world
call
loudly
whereupon
levinski
took
on
one
side
and
told
the
audience
how
when
had
been
a
young
man
some
good
woman
had
refused
for
a
similar
reason
and
had
been
miserable
ever
since
accordingly
in
the
second
act
withdrew
her
refusal
and
offered
to
marry
who
declined
to
take
advantage
of
her
offer
for
fear
that
she
was
willing
to
marry
him
from
pity
rather
than
from
love
whereupon
levinski
took
on
one
side
and
told
the
audience
how
when
had
been
a
young
man
he
had
refused
to
marry
some
good
woman
a
different
one
for
a
similar
reason
and
had
been
ever
afterwards
in
the
third
act
it
really
seemed
as
though
they
were
coming
together
at
last
for
at
the
beginning
of
it
levinski
took
them
both
aside
and
told
the
audience
a
parable
about
a
butterfly
and
a
which
was
both
pretty
and
helpful
and
caused
several
ladies
in
the
first
and
second
rows
of
the
upper
circle
to
say
what
a
nice
man
levinski
must
be
at
home
dear
the
purport
of
the
allegory
being
to
show
that
both
and
were
being
very
silly
as
indeed
by
this
time
everybody
but
the
author
was
aware
unfortunately
at
that
moment
a
footman
entered
with
a
telegram
for
which
announced
that
she
had
been
left
fifty
thousand
pounds
by
a
dead
uncle
in
australia
and
although
levinski
seized
this
fresh
opportunity
to
tell
the
audience
how
in
similar
circumstances
pride
to
his
lasting
remorse
had
kept
and
some
good
woman
a
third
one
apart
nevertheless
held
back
once
more
for
fear
lest
he
should
be
thought
to
be
marrying
her
for
her
money
the
curtain
comes
down
as
he
says
good
but
there
is
a
fourth
act
and
in
the
fourth
act
levinski
has
a
splendid
time
he
tells
the
audience
two
parables
one
about
a
dahlia
and
a
sheep
which
i
could
quite
follow
and
three
reminiscences
of
life
in
india
he
brings
together
finally
and
for
ever
these
hesitating
lovers
and
best
of
all
he
has
a
magnificent
of
his
own
with
a
pretty
widow
in
which
we
see
for
the
first
time
in
the
play
how
love
should
really
be
made
not
love
but
the
deep
emotion
felt
and
with
occasional
lapses
of
memory
explained
by
a
man
with
a
slight
who
has
knocked
about
the
world
a
bit
and
knows
life
levinski
i
need
not
say
was
at
his
best
in
this
act
i
met
prosper
vane
at
the
club
some
ten
days
before
the
first
night
and
asked
him
how
rehearsals
were
going
oh
all
right
he
said
but
it
a
rotten
play
i
got
such
a
dashed
silly
part
from
what
you
told
me
i
said
it
sounded
rather
good
it
so
dashed
unnatural
for
three
whole
acts
this
girl
and
i
are
in
love
with
each
other
and
we
know
we
in
love
with
each
other
and
yet
we
simply
fool
about
she
a
dashed
pretty
girl
too
my
boy
in
real
life
i
jolly
soon
my
dear
alfred
i
protested
you
not
going
to
fall
in
love
with
the
girl
you
have
to
fall
in
love
with
on
the
stage
i
thought
actors
never
did
that
they
do
sometimes
it
a
dashed
good
advertisement
anyway
it
a
silly
part
and
i
fed
up
with
it
yes
but
do
be
reasonable
if
got
engaged
at
once
to
what
would
happen
to
levinski
he
have
nothing
to
do
prosper
vane
grunted
as
he
seemed
disinclined
for
further
conversation
i
left
him
the
opening
night
came
and
the
usual
distinguished
and
fashionable
audience
including
myself
such
as
habitually
attends
first
nights
settled
down
to
enjoy
itself
two
acts
went
well
at
the
end
of
each
levinski
came
before
the
curtain
and
bowed
to
us
and
we
had
the
honour
of
clapping
him
loud
and
long
then
the
third
act
began
now
this
is
how
the
third
act
ends
sir
geoffrey
breaking
the
silence
dick
you
heard
what
he
said
do
let
this
silly
money
come
between
us
i
have
told
you
i
love
you
dear
wo
you
wo
you
speak
to
me
winifred
i
gets
up
and
walks
round
the
room
his
brow
knotted
his
right
fist
occasionally
striking
his
left
palm
finally
he
comes
to
a
stand
in
front
of
winifred
i
raises
his
arms
slowly
at
right
angles
to
his
body
and
lets
them
fall
heavily
down
i
ca
a
low
hoarse
i
ca
stands
for
a
moment
with
bent
head
then
with
a
jerk
he
pulls
himself
hands
go
out
to
her
but
he
draws
them
back
as
if
frightened
to
touch
her
good
squares
his
shoulders
and
stands
looking
at
the
audience
with
his
chin
in
the
air
then
with
a
shrug
of
utter
despair
which
would
bring
tears
into
the
eyes
of
any
young
thing
in
the
pit
he
turns
and
with
bent
head
walks
slowly
curtain
that
how
the
third
act
ends
i
went
to
the
dress
rehearsal
and
so
i
know
how
the
accident
happened
i
do
not
know
i
suppose
prosper
was
nervous
i
am
sure
he
was
very
much
in
love
anyhow
this
is
how
on
that
famous
first
night
the
third
act
ended
sir
geoffrey
the
dick
you
heard
what
he
said
do
let
this
silly
money
come
between
us
i
have
told
you
i
love
you
dear
wo
you
wo
you
speak
to
me
winifred
i
a
great
i
love
you
whereupon
he
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
triumphantly
off
the
stage
and
after
a
little
natural
hesitation
the
curtain
came
down
behind
the
scenes
all
was
consternation
levinski
absolutely
furious
had
a
hasty
consultation
with
the
author
also
furious
in
the
course
of
which
they
both
saw
that
the
fourth
act
as
written
was
now
an
impossibility
poor
prosper
who
had
almost
immediately
recovered
his
sanity
tremblingly
suggested
that
levinski
should
announce
that
owing
to
the
sudden
illness
of
vane
the
fourth
act
could
not
be
given
levinski
was
kind
enough
to
consider
this
suggestion
not
entirely
stupid
his
own
idea
having
been
very
regretfully
to
leave
out
the
two
parables
and
three
reminiscences
from
india
and
concentrate
on
the
with
the
widow
yes
yes
he
said
your
plan
is
better
i
will
say
you
are
ill
it
is
true
you
are
mad
we
will
play
it
as
it
was
written
you
ca
said
the
author
gloomily
the
critics
wo
come
till
the
fourth
act
and
they
assume
that
the
third
act
ended
as
it
did
the
fourth
act
will
seem
all
nonsense
to
them
true
and
i
was
so
good
so
much
myself
in
that
act
he
turned
to
prosper
you
fool
or
there
another
way
began
the
author
we
might
and
then
a
gentleman
in
the
gallery
settled
it
from
the
front
of
the
curtain
there
was
nothing
in
the
programme
to
show
that
the
play
was
in
four
acts
the
time
is
the
present
day
and
the
scene
is
in
sir
geoffrey
throssell
was
all
it
said
and
the
gentleman
in
the
gallery
thinking
it
was
all
over
and
being
pleased
with
the
play
and
particularly
with
the
realism
of
the
last
moment
of
it
shouted
and
suddenly
everybody
else
cried
author
the
play
was
ended
i
said
that
this
was
the
story
of
a
comedy
which
nearly
became
a
tragedy
but
it
turned
out
to
be
no
tragedy
at
all
in
the
three
acts
to
which
prosper
vane
had
condemned
it
the
play
appealed
to
both
critics
and
public
for
the
fourth
act
as
he
recognised
so
clearly
was
unnecessary
and
would
have
spoilt
the
balance
of
it
entirely
best
of
all
the
shortening
of
the
play
demanded
that
some
entertainment
should
be
provided
in
front
of
it
and
this
enabled
levinski
to
introduce
to
the
public
professor
wollabollacolla
and
princess
collabollawolla
the
famous
exponents
of
the
that
fascinating
central
african
war
dance
which
was
soon
to
be
the
rage
of
society
but
though
as
a
result
the
takings
of
the
box
office
surpassed
all
previous
records
our
friend
prosper
vane
received
no
practical
acknowledgment
of
his
services
he
had
to
be
content
with
the
hand
and
heart
of
the
lady
who
played
and
the
fact
that
levinski
was
good
enough
to
attend
the
wedding
there
was
in
fact
a
photograph
in
all
the
papers
of
levinski
doing
it
under
entirely
new
management
i
know
a
fool
of
a
dog
who
pretends
that
he
is
a
cocker
spaniel
and
is
convinced
that
the
world
revolves
round
him
wonderingly
the
sun
rises
so
it
may
shine
on
his
glossy
morning
coat
it
sets
so
his
master
may
know
that
it
is
time
for
the
evening
biscuit
if
the
rain
falls
it
is
that
a
fool
of
a
dog
may
wipe
on
his
mistress
skirt
his
muddy
boots
his
day
is
always
exciting
always
full
of
the
same
good
things
his
night
a
repetition
of
his
day
more
gloriously
developed
if
there
be
a
sacred
moment
before
the
dawn
when
he
lies
awake
and
ponders
on
life
he
tells
himself
confidently
that
it
will
go
on
for
ever
like
this
a
life
planned
nobly
for
himself
but
one
in
which
the
master
and
mistress
whom
he
protects
must
always
find
a
place
and
i
think
perhaps
he
would
want
a
place
for
me
too
in
that
life
who
am
not
his
real
master
but
yet
one
of
the
house
i
hope
he
would
what
chum
does
know
is
this
his
master
and
mistress
are
leaving
him
they
are
going
to
a
part
of
the
world
where
a
fool
of
a
dog
with
no
manners
is
a
nuisance
if
chum
could
see
all
the
good
little
london
dogs
who
at
home
sit
languidly
on
their
mistress
lap
and
abroad
take
their
view
of
life
through
a
muff
much
bigger
than
themselves
if
he
could
see
the
big
obedient
dogs
who
walk
solemnly
through
the
park
carrying
their
master
stick
never
pausing
in
their
impressive
march
unless
it
be
to
plunge
into
the
serpentine
and
rescue
a
drowning
child
he
would
know
what
i
mean
he
would
admit
that
a
dog
who
can
not
answer
to
his
own
name
and
pays
but
little
more
attention
to
down
idiot
and
come
here
fool
is
not
every
place
dog
he
would
admit
it
if
he
had
time
but
before
i
could
have
called
his
attention
to
half
the
good
dogs
i
had
marked
out
he
would
have
sat
down
beaming
in
front
of
a
and
then
he
would
never
have
known
what
now
he
will
know
so
soon
that
his
master
and
mistress
are
leaving
him
it
has
been
my
business
to
find
a
new
home
for
him
this
is
harder
than
you
think
i
can
make
him
sound
lovable
but
i
can
not
make
him
sound
good
of
course
i
might
leave
out
his
doubtful
qualities
and
describe
him
merely
as
beautiful
and
affectionate
i
might
but
i
could
i
think
chum
habitual
smile
would
get
larger
he
would
wriggle
the
end
of
himself
more
ecstatically
than
ever
if
he
heard
himself
summed
up
as
beautiful
and
affectionate
anyway
i
could
do
it
for
i
get
carried
away
when
i
speak
of
him
and
i
reveal
all
his
bad
qualities
i
am
afraid
he
is
a
snob
i
confessed
to
one
woman
of
whom
i
had
hopes
he
does
much
care
for
what
he
calls
the
lower
classes
oh
she
said
yes
he
hates
badly
dressed
people
corduroy
trousers
tied
up
at
the
knee
always
excite
him
i
do
know
if
any
of
your
family
no
i
suppose
not
but
if
he
ever
sees
a
man
with
his
trousers
tied
up
at
the
knee
he
goes
for
him
and
he
ca
bear
tradespeople
at
least
not
the
men
washerwomen
he
loves
he
rather
likes
the
too
once
when
he
was
left
alone
with
it
for
a
moment
he
appeared
shortly
afterwards
on
the
lawn
with
a
pair
of
well
i
mean
he
had
no
business
with
them
at
all
we
got
them
away
after
a
bit
of
a
chase
and
then
they
had
to
go
to
the
wash
again
it
seemed
rather
a
pity
when
they
only
just
come
back
of
course
i
smacked
his
head
for
him
but
he
looks
so
surprised
and
reproachful
when
he
done
wrong
that
you
never
feel
quite
his
fault
i
doubt
if
i
shall
be
able
to
take
him
after
all
she
said
i
just
remembered
i
forget
what
it
was
she
remembered
but
it
meant
that
i
was
still
without
a
new
home
for
chum
what
does
he
eat
somebody
else
asked
me
it
seemed
hopeful
i
could
see
chum
already
installed
officially
i
said
he
lives
on
puppy
biscuits
he
also
has
the
after
breakfast
and
an
occasional
bone
privately
he
is
fond
of
bees
i
have
seen
him
eat
as
many
as
six
bees
in
an
afternoon
sometimes
he
wanders
down
to
the
and
picks
the
gooseberries
he
likes
all
fruit
but
gooseberries
are
the
things
he
can
reach
best
when
there
are
any
gooseberries
about
he
has
to
be
content
with
the
hips
and
haws
from
the
but
really
you
need
bother
he
can
eat
anything
the
only
thing
he
does
like
is
whitening
we
were
just
going
to
mark
the
lawn
one
day
and
while
we
were
busy
pegging
it
out
he
wandered
up
and
drank
the
whitening
out
of
the
marker
it
is
practically
the
only
disappointment
he
has
ever
had
he
looked
at
us
and
you
could
see
that
his
opinion
of
us
had
gone
down
did
you
it
there
for
if
you
did
mean
me
to
drink
it
he
said
reproachfully
then
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
and
thoughtfully
back
to
his
kennel
he
never
came
out
till
next
morning
really
said
my
man
well
i
shall
have
to
think
about
it
i
let
you
know
of
course
i
knew
what
he
meant
with
a
third
to
whom
i
spoke
the
negotiations
came
to
grief
not
apparently
because
of
any
fault
of
chum
but
because
if
you
will
believe
it
of
my
shortcomings
at
least
i
can
suppose
nothing
else
for
this
man
had
been
enthusiastic
about
him
he
had
revelled
in
the
tale
of
chum
wickedness
he
had
adored
him
for
being
so
conceited
he
had
practically
said
that
he
would
take
him
do
i
begged
i
sure
he
be
happy
with
you
you
see
he
not
everybody
dog
i
mean
i
do
want
any
odd
man
whom
i
do
know
to
take
him
it
must
be
a
friend
of
mine
so
that
i
shall
often
be
able
to
see
chum
afterwards
so
that
what
he
asked
anxiously
so
that
i
shall
often
be
able
to
see
chum
afterwards
you
know
and
so
on
i
could
bear
to
lose
the
silly
old
ass
altogether
he
looked
thoughtful
and
when
i
went
on
to
speak
about
chum
fondness
for
chickens
and
his
other
lovable
ways
he
changed
the
subject
altogether
he
wrote
afterwards
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
manage
with
a
third
dog
and
i
like
to
think
he
was
not
afraid
of
chum
but
only
of
me
but
i
have
found
the
right
man
at
last
a
day
will
come
soon
when
i
shall
take
chum
from
his
present
home
to
his
new
one
that
will
be
a
great
day
for
him
i
can
see
him
in
the
train
wiping
his
boots
effusively
on
every
new
passenger
wriggling
under
the
seat
and
out
again
from
sheer
joy
of
life
i
can
see
him
in
the
taxi
taking
his
one
brief
impression
of
a
world
that
means
nothing
to
him
i
can
see
him
in
another
train
joyous
eager
putting
his
paws
on
my
collar
from
time
to
time
and
saying
excitedly
a
day
this
is
and
if
he
survives
the
journey
if
i
can
keep
him
on
the
way
from
all
the
delightful
deaths
he
longs
to
try
if
i
can
get
him
safely
to
his
new
house
then
i
can
see
him
well
i
wonder
what
will
they
do
to
him
when
i
see
him
again
will
he
be
a
sober
little
dog
answering
to
his
name
careful
to
keep
his
muddy
feet
off
the
visitor
trousers
grown
up
obedient
following
to
heel
round
the
garden
the
faithful
servant
of
his
master
or
will
he
be
the
same
old
silly
ass
no
use
to
anybody
always
dirty
always
smiling
always
in
the
way
a
clumsy
blundering
fool
of
a
dog
who
knows
you
ca
help
loving
him
i
wonder
between
ourselves
i
do
think
they
alter
him
now
oh
i
hope
they
ca
a
farewell
tour
this
is
positively
chum
last
appearance
in
print
for
his
own
sake
no
less
than
for
yours
he
is
conceited
enough
as
it
is
but
if
once
he
got
to
know
that
people
are
always
writing
about
him
in
books
his
swagger
would
be
unbearable
however
i
have
said
to
him
now
i
have
no
longer
any
rights
in
him
yesterday
i
saw
him
off
to
his
new
home
and
when
we
meet
again
it
will
be
on
a
different
footing
is
that
your
dog
i
shall
say
to
his
master
what
is
he
a
cocker
jolly
little
fellows
are
they
i
had
one
myself
once
as
chum
refused
to
do
the
journey
across
london
by
himself
i
met
him
at
liverpool
street
he
came
up
in
a
crate
the
world
must
have
seemed
very
small
to
him
on
the
way
hallo
old
ass
i
said
to
him
through
the
bars
and
in
the
little
space
they
gave
him
he
wriggled
his
body
with
delight
thank
heaven
there
of
alive
he
said
i
think
this
is
my
dog
i
said
to
the
guard
and
i
told
him
my
name
he
asked
for
my
card
i
afraid
i
have
one
with
me
i
explained
when
policemen
touch
me
on
the
shoulder
and
ask
me
to
go
quietly
when
i
drag
old
gentlemen
from
underneath
and
they
decide
to
adopt
me
on
the
spot
on
all
the
important
occasions
when
one
really
wants
a
card
i
never
have
one
with
me
ca
give
him
up
without
proof
of
identity
said
the
guard
and
chum
grinned
at
the
idea
of
being
thought
so
valuable
i
felt
in
my
pockets
for
letters
there
was
only
one
but
it
offered
to
lend
me
on
my
note
of
hand
alone
it
was
addressed
to
dear
sir
and
though
i
pointed
out
to
the
guard
that
i
was
the
sir
he
still
kept
tight
hold
of
chum
strange
that
one
man
should
be
prepared
to
trust
me
with
and
another
should
be
so
chary
of
confiding
to
me
a
small
black
spaniel
tell
the
gentleman
who
i
am
i
said
imploringly
through
the
bars
show
him
you
know
me
he
all
right
said
chum
looking
at
the
guard
with
his
great
honest
brown
eyes
he
been
with
us
for
years
and
then
i
had
an
inspiration
i
turned
down
the
inside
pocket
of
my
coat
and
there
stitched
into
it
was
the
label
of
my
tailor
with
my
name
written
on
it
i
had
often
wondered
why
tailors
did
this
obviously
they
know
how
stupid
guards
can
be
i
suppose
that
all
right
said
the
guard
reluctantly
of
course
i
might
have
stolen
the
coat
i
see
his
point
you
you
would
like
a
nice
for
yourself
i
said
timidly
you
see
i
thought
i
put
chum
on
the
lead
i
got
to
take
him
to
paddington
and
he
must
be
tired
of
his
shell
by
now
it
is
as
if
he
were
an
armadillo
the
guard
thought
he
would
like
a
shilling
and
a
nice
wood
he
agreed
was
always
wood
particularly
in
winter
but
there
were
times
when
you
were
not
ready
for
it
how
are
you
taking
him
he
asked
getting
to
work
with
a
chisel
underground
underground
i
cried
in
horror
take
chum
on
the
underground
take
have
you
ever
taken
a
large
live
on
the
end
of
a
string
into
a
crowded
carriage
the
guard
never
had
well
do
take
him
in
a
taxi
instead
do
waste
him
on
other
people
the
crate
yawned
slowly
and
chum
emerged
all
over
straw
we
had
an
anxious
moment
but
the
two
of
us
got
him
down
and
put
the
lead
on
him
then
chum
and
i
went
off
for
a
taxi
hooray
said
chum
wriggling
all
over
is
this
splendid
i
say
which
way
are
you
going
i
going
this
way
no
i
mean
the
other
way
somebody
had
left
some
of
his
on
the
platform
three
times
we
went
round
one
in
opposite
directions
and
unwound
ourselves
the
wrong
way
then
i
hauled
him
in
took
him
struggling
in
my
arms
and
got
into
a
cab
the
journey
to
paddington
was
full
of
interest
for
a
whole
minute
chum
stood
quietly
on
the
seat
rested
his
on
the
open
window
and
drank
in
london
then
he
jumped
down
and
went
mad
he
tried
to
hang
me
with
the
lead
and
then
in
remorse
tried
to
hang
himself
he
made
a
dash
for
the
little
window
at
the
back
missed
it
and
dived
out
of
the
window
at
the
side
was
hauled
back
and
kissed
me
ecstatically
in
the
eye
with
his
sharpest
tooth
and
i
thought
the
world
was
at
an
end
he
said
and
there
were
no
more
people
oh
i
am
an
ass
i
say
did
you
notice
i
had
my
hair
cut
how
do
you
like
my
new
trousers
i
must
show
you
them
he
jumped
on
to
my
lap
no
i
think
you
see
them
better
on
the
ground
he
said
and
jumped
down
again
or
no
perhaps
you
get
a
better
view
if
he
jumped
up
hastily
and
yet
i
know
he
dived
down
though
of
course
if
you
oh
lor
this
a
day
and
he
put
both
paws
lovingly
on
my
collar
suddenly
he
was
quiet
again
the
stillness
the
absence
of
storm
in
the
taxi
was
so
unnatural
that
i
began
to
miss
it
buck
up
old
fool
i
said
but
he
sat
motionless
by
my
side
plunged
in
thought
i
tried
to
cheer
him
up
i
pointed
out
king
cross
to
him
he
would
even
bark
at
it
i
called
his
attention
to
the
poster
outside
the
euston
theatre
of
the
two
biffs
for
all
the
regard
he
showed
he
might
never
even
have
heard
of
them
the
monumental
masonry
by
portland
road
failed
to
uplift
him
at
baker
street
he
woke
up
and
grinned
cheerily
it
all
right
he
said
i
was
trying
to
remember
what
happened
to
me
this
morning
something
rather
miserable
i
thought
but
i
ca
get
hold
of
it
however
it
all
right
now
how
are
and
he
went
mad
again
at
paddington
i
bought
a
label
at
the
bookstall
and
wrote
it
for
him
he
went
round
and
round
my
leg
looking
for
me
funny
thing
he
said
as
he
began
to
unwind
he
was
here
a
moment
ago
i
just
go
round
once
more
i
rather
think
oh
there
you
are
i
stepped
off
him
unravelled
the
lead
and
dragged
him
to
the
parcels
office
i
want
to
send
this
by
the
two
train
i
said
to
the
man
the
other
side
of
the
counter
send
what
he
said
i
looked
down
chum
was
making
himself
very
small
and
black
in
the
shadow
of
the
counter
he
was
completely
hidden
from
the
sight
of
anybody
the
other
side
of
it
come
out
i
said
and
show
yourself
not
much
he
said
a
parcel
i
not
going
to
be
a
jolly
old
parcel
for
anybody
it
only
a
way
of
speaking
i
pleaded
actually
you
are
travelling
as
a
small
black
gentleman
you
will
go
with
the
guard
a
delightful
man
chum
came
out
reluctantly
the
clerk
leant
over
the
counter
and
managed
to
see
him
according
to
our
regulations
he
said
and
i
always
dislike
people
who
begin
like
that
he
has
to
be
on
a
chain
a
leather
lead
wo
do
chum
smiled
all
over
himself
i
do
know
which
pleased
him
more
the
suggestion
that
he
was
a
very
large
and
fierce
dog
or
the
impossibility
now
of
his
travelling
with
the
guard
delightful
man
though
he
might
be
he
gave
himself
a
shake
and
started
for
the
door
tut
tut
it
a
great
disappointment
to
me
he
said
trying
to
look
disappointed
but
his
back
wriggle
this
chain
business
silly
of
us
not
to
have
known
well
well
we
shall
be
wiser
another
time
now
let
go
home
poor
old
chum
i
known
from
a
large
coat
pocket
i
produced
a
chain
it
said
chum
looking
up
at
me
pathetically
you
might
almost
to
get
rid
of
me
he
was
chained
and
the
label
tied
on
to
him
forgive
me
that
label
chum
i
think
that
was
the
worst
offence
of
all
and
why
should
i
label
one
who
was
speaking
so
eloquently
for
himself
who
said
from
the
tip
of
his
little
black
nose
to
the
end
of
his
stumpy
black
tail
i
a
silly
old
ass
but
there
nothing
wrong
in
me
and
they
sending
me
away
but
according
to
the
regulations
one
must
obey
the
regulations
chum
i
gave
him
to
the
guard
a
delightful
man
the
guard
and
i
chained
him
to
a
brake
or
something
then
the
guard
went
away
and
chum
and
i
had
a
little
talk
after
that
the
train
went
off
little
dog
the
truth
about
home
rails
imagine
us
if
you
can
sitting
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
i
with
my
feet
on
the
mantelpiece
margery
curled
up
in
the
blue
both
of
us
intent
on
the
morning
paper
to
me
by
good
chance
has
fallen
the
sporting
page
to
margery
the
foreign
political
and
financial
intelligence
of
the
day
what
said
margery
does
it
mean
when
it
says
she
stopped
and
spelt
it
over
to
herself
again
i
put
down
my
piece
of
the
paper
and
prepared
to
explain
the
desire
for
knowledge
in
the
young
can
not
be
too
strongly
encouraged
and
i
have
always
flattered
myself
that
i
can
explain
in
perfectly
simple
language
anything
which
a
child
wants
to
know
for
instance
i
once
told
margery
what
miniature
rifle
shooting
meant
it
was
a
which
she
had
come
across
in
her
paper
the
explanation
took
some
time
owing
to
margery
preconceived
idea
that
a
bird
entered
into
it
somewhere
several
times
when
i
thought
the
lesson
was
over
she
said
well
what
about
the
bird
but
i
think
i
made
it
plain
to
her
in
the
end
though
maybe
she
has
forgotten
about
it
now
what
said
margery
does
it
mean
when
it
says
rails
firm
i
took
up
my
paper
again
the
cambridge
fifteen
i
was
glad
to
see
were
rapidly
developing
into
a
team
and
rails
firm
repeated
margery
and
looked
up
at
me
my
mind
worked
rapidly
as
it
always
does
in
a
crisis
what
did
you
say
i
asked
in
surprise
what
does
rails
firm
mean
where
does
it
say
that
i
went
on
still
thinking
at
lightning
speed
there
it
said
it
yesterday
too
ah
yes
i
made
up
my
mind
well
i
said
i
think
is
something
you
must
ask
your
father
i
did
ask
him
yesterday
well
then
he
told
me
to
ask
mummy
coward
you
can
be
sure
i
said
firmly
that
what
mummy
told
you
would
be
right
and
i
returned
to
my
paper
mummy
told
me
to
wait
till
came
really
these
parents
the
way
they
shirk
their
responsibilities
nowadays
is
disgusting
rails
firm
said
margery
and
settled
herself
to
listen
it
is
good
that
children
should
be
encouraged
to
take
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
day
but
i
do
think
that
a
little
girl
might
be
taught
by
her
father
or
if
more
convenient
mother
part
of
a
newspaper
to
read
had
margery
asked
me
the
difference
between
a
bunker
and
a
banker
had
she
demanded
an
explanation
of
ultimatum
or
guillotine
i
could
have
done
something
with
it
but
to
let
a
child
of
six
fill
her
head
with
ideas
as
to
the
firmness
or
otherwise
of
home
rails
is
hardly
nice
however
an
explanation
had
to
be
given
well
it
like
this
margery
i
said
at
last
supposing
well
you
see
supposing
that
is
to
say
if
and
then
i
stopped
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
intuition
they
call
it
that
i
was
beginning
in
the
wrong
way
go
on
said
margery
perhaps
i
had
better
put
it
this
way
supposing
you
were
to
well
we
better
begin
further
back
than
that
you
know
what
no
i
suppose
you
do
know
that
well
if
i
that
is
to
say
when
a
man
you
know
it
rather
difficult
to
explain
this
margery
are
you
explaining
it
now
i
just
going
to
begin
thank
you
uncle
i
lit
my
pipe
slowly
while
i
considered
again
how
best
to
approach
the
matter
rails
firm
said
margery
is
it
a
thing
to
say
it
was
it
was
a
very
thing
to
say
whoever
said
it
first
might
have
known
what
it
would
lead
to
perhaps
i
can
explain
it
best
like
this
margery
i
said
beginning
on
a
new
tack
i
suppose
you
know
what
means
what
does
it
mean
ah
well
if
you
do
know
i
said
rather
pleased
perhaps
i
had
better
explain
that
first
means
that
that
is
to
say
you
call
a
thing
firm
if
it
well
if
it
does
that
is
to
say
a
thing
is
firm
if
it
ca
like
a
house
well
something
like
that
this
chair
for
instance
and
i
put
my
hand
on
her
chair
is
firm
because
you
ca
shake
it
you
see
quite
hallo
what
that
oh
you
bad
uncle
you
knocked
the
castor
off
again
cried
margery
greatly
excited
at
the
incident
this
is
too
much
i
said
bitterly
even
the
furniture
is
against
me
go
on
explaining
said
margery
rocking
herself
in
the
now
wobbly
chair
i
decided
to
leave
firm
it
is
not
an
easy
word
to
explain
at
the
best
of
times
and
when
everything
you
touch
goes
and
breaks
itself
it
becomes
perfectly
impossible
well
so
much
for
that
i
said
and
now
we
come
to
you
know
what
rails
are
like
i
got
in
the
nursery
this
was
splendid
i
had
forgotten
these
for
the
moment
exactly
the
rails
your
train
goes
on
well
then
rails
would
be
rails
at
well
i
them
at
home
said
margery
in
surprise
i
have
them
anywhere
else
quite
so
then
rails
firm
would
mean
that
er
home
rails
were
er
firm
but
mine
are
because
they
wobble
you
know
they
do
yes
but
well
why
do
they
say
rails
firm
when
they
mean
rails
wobble
ah
that
just
it
the
point
is
that
when
they
say
rails
firm
they
do
mean
that
the
rails
are
firm
in
fact
they
do
mean
at
all
what
you
think
they
mean
they
mean
something
quite
different
what
they
mean
i
am
just
going
to
explain
i
said
stiffly
or
perhaps
i
had
better
put
it
this
way
i
said
ten
minutes
later
supposing
oh
margery
it
difficult
to
explain
i
know
said
margery
do
you
want
to
know
so
badly
i
want
to
know
a
million
million
times
more
than
anything
else
in
the
whole
world
why
so
as
i
can
tell
angela
said
margery
i
plunged
into
my
explanation
again
angela
is
three
and
i
can
quite
see
how
important
it
is
that
she
should
be
sound
on
the
question
the
king
sons
tell
me
a
story
said
what
sort
of
a
story
a
fairy
story
because
it
but
you
know
all
the
fairy
stories
then
tell
me
a
new
fairy
story
right
i
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
who
had
three
sons
the
eldest
son
was
a
very
thoughtful
youth
he
always
had
a
reason
for
everything
he
did
and
sometimes
he
would
say
things
like
economically
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
the
state
that
or
the
civic
interests
of
the
community
demand
that
before
doing
something
specially
horrid
he
did
want
to
be
unkind
to
anybody
but
he
took
what
he
called
a
large
view
of
things
and
if
you
happened
to
ask
for
a
third
help
of
he
took
the
large
view
that
you
would
be
sorry
about
it
next
morning
and
so
you
did
have
your
he
was
called
prince
proper
the
second
son
was
a
very
wise
youth
you
could
catch
him
anyhow
if
you
asked
him
whether
he
knew
the
story
of
the
three
wells
or
why
does
a
chicken
cross
the
road
or
anything
really
amusing
like
that
he
would
always
say
oh
i
heard
that
ago
and
whenever
you
began
adam
and
eve
and
pinchme
he
would
pinch
you
at
once
without
waiting
like
a
gentleman
until
you
had
got
to
the
end
of
the
verse
he
was
called
prince
clever
and
the
third
son
was
just
wonderfully
beautiful
he
had
the
most
marvellously
pink
cheeks
and
long
golden
hair
that
you
have
ever
seen
i
do
much
care
for
that
style
myself
but
in
the
country
in
which
he
lived
it
was
admired
more
than
i
can
tell
you
he
was
called
prince
goldenlocks
i
give
you
three
guesses
why
now
the
king
had
reigned
a
long
time
so
long
that
he
was
tired
of
being
king
and
he
often
used
to
wonder
which
of
his
sons
ought
to
succeed
him
of
course
nowadays
they
never
wonder
and
the
eldest
son
becomes
king
at
once
and
quite
right
too
but
in
those
days
it
was
generally
left
to
the
sons
to
prove
which
among
themselves
was
the
most
worthy
sometimes
they
would
all
be
sent
out
to
find
the
magic
dragon
tooth
and
only
one
would
come
back
alive
which
would
save
a
lot
of
trouble
or
else
after
a
lot
of
discussion
they
would
be
told
to
go
and
find
beautiful
princesses
for
themselves
and
the
one
which
brought
back
the
most
beautiful
princess
but
very
often
that
would
lead
to
another
discussion
the
best
way
of
all
was
to
call
in
a
fairy
to
help
a
fairy
has
all
sorts
of
tricks
for
finding
out
about
you
and
her
favourite
plan
is
to
pretend
to
be
something
else
and
see
what
you
do
so
the
king
called
in
a
fairy
and
said
i
am
sending
out
my
three
sons
into
the
world
to
seek
their
fortune
i
want
you
to
test
them
for
me
and
find
out
which
is
the
most
fitted
to
succeed
to
my
throne
if
it
happen
to
be
prince
goldenlocks
but
of
course
i
want
to
influence
you
in
any
way
leave
it
to
me
said
the
fairy
you
agree
no
doubt
that
the
quality
most
desirable
in
a
king
is
love
and
kindliness
said
the
king
doubtfully
i
was
sure
of
it
well
i
have
a
way
of
putting
this
quality
to
the
test
which
has
never
yet
failed
and
with
that
she
vanished
she
could
have
gone
out
at
the
door
quite
easily
but
she
preferred
to
vanish
i
expect
you
know
what
her
way
was
you
have
read
about
it
often
in
your
fairy
books
on
the
next
day
as
prince
proper
was
coming
along
the
road
she
appeared
suddenly
in
front
of
him
in
the
shape
of
a
poor
old
woman
please
give
me
something
to
buy
a
crust
of
bread
pretty
gentleman
she
pleaded
i
starving
prince
proper
looked
at
her
sternly
economically
he
said
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
the
state
that
the
submerged
classes
should
be
a
charge
on
the
state
itself
and
not
on
individuals
the
civic
interests
of
the
community
demand
that
promiscuous
charity
should
be
sternly
discouraged
surely
you
see
that
for
yourself
the
fairy
did
quite
the
language
had
taken
her
by
surprise
in
all
her
previous
adventures
of
this
kind
two
of
the
young
princes
had
refused
her
roughly
and
the
third
had
shared
his
last
piece
of
bread
with
her
this
adventure
was
going
all
wrong
let
me
explain
it
to
you
more
fully
went
on
proper
and
for
an
hour
and
minutes
he
did
so
then
he
went
on
his
way
leaving
a
dazed
fairy
behind
him
by
and
by
prince
clever
came
along
suddenly
he
saw
a
poor
old
woman
in
front
of
him
please
give
me
something
to
buy
a
crust
of
bread
she
pleaded
starving
prince
clever
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
you
do
catch
he
said
i
read
about
this
a
times
you
not
an
old
woman
at
all
you
a
fairy
do
you
mean
she
stammered
this
is
a
silly
test
of
father
well
you
can
tell
him
he
got
son
who
clever
enough
to
see
through
him
and
he
went
on
his
way
by
and
by
prince
goldenlocks
came
along
i
need
not
say
that
he
did
all
that
you
would
expect
of
a
third
and
youngest
son
who
had
pink
cheeks
long
golden
hair
and
as
i
ought
to
have
said
before
a
very
loving
nature
he
shared
his
last
piece
of
bread
with
the
poor
old
woman
surely
he
will
get
the
throne
but
the
fairy
was
an
honest
fairy
she
did
understand
proper
point
of
view
she
had
to
admit
that
if
clever
saw
through
her
deception
it
was
honourable
of
him
to
have
said
so
and
though
of
course
her
loving
heart
was
all
for
prince
goldenlocks
she
felt
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
award
the
throne
to
him
without
a
further
trial
so
she
did
another
thing
that
she
was
very
fond
of
doing
she
changed
herself
into
a
pretty
little
dove
and
right
in
front
of
prince
proper
she
flew
with
a
hawk
in
pursuit
of
her
we
shall
see
she
said
to
herself
which
of
the
three
youths
has
the
softest
heart
you
can
guess
what
proper
said
life
he
said
is
one
constant
battle
nature
he
said
is
ruthless
and
the
weakest
must
go
to
the
wall
if
i
kill
the
hawk
he
said
i
am
kind
to
the
dove
but
am
i
he
said
and
i
think
there
was
a
good
deal
in
this
am
i
kind
to
the
caterpillar
or
whatever
it
is
that
the
dove
eats
of
course
you
know
there
that
to
be
thought
of
anyhow
after
soliloquizing
for
minutes
prince
proper
went
on
his
way
and
by
and
by
prince
clever
came
along
you
can
guess
what
clever
said
my
whiskers
he
said
this
is
older
than
the
last
i
knew
this
in
my
cradle
with
one
of
those
nasty
sarcastic
laughs
that
i
hate
so
much
he
went
on
his
way
and
by
and
by
prince
goldenlocks
came
along
now
then
goldenlocks
the
throne
is
almost
yours
you
can
guess
what
goldenlocks
said
poor
little
dove
he
said
but
i
can
save
its
life
rapidly
he
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bow
and
with
careful
aim
let
fly
at
the
pursuing
hawk
i
say
again
that
prince
goldenlocks
was
the
most
beautiful
youth
you
have
ever
seen
in
your
life
and
he
had
a
very
loving
nature
but
he
was
a
poor
shot
he
hit
the
dove
is
that
all
said
that
all
i
said
good
night
disappointment
my
young
friend
bobby
now
in
the
early
thirteens
has
been
making
his
plans
for
the
christmas
holidays
he
communicated
them
to
me
in
a
letter
from
school
i
am
going
to
write
an
opera
in
the
holidays
with
a
boy
called
short
a
very
great
and
confident
friend
of
mine
here
i
am
doing
the
words
and
short
is
doing
the
music
we
have
already
got
the
title
it
is
called
last
week
on
his
return
to
town
he
came
to
see
me
at
my
club
and
when
the
waiter
had
brought
in
drinks
and
bobby
had
refused
a
cigar
i
lighted
up
and
prepared
to
talk
shop
his
recent
discovery
that
i
write
too
leads
him
to
treat
me
with
more
respect
than
formerly
now
then
i
said
tell
me
about
it
how
it
going
on
oo
i
have
done
much
yet
said
bobby
but
i
got
the
plot
let
have
it
bobby
unfolded
it
rapidly
well
you
see
there
a
chap
called
tommy
he
the
hero
and
just
come
back
from
oxford
and
he
awfully
and
decent
and
all
that
and
he
in
love
with
felicia
you
see
and
there
another
chap
called
reynolds
and
you
see
felicia
really
the
same
as
phyllis
who
going
to
marry
samuel
and
that
the
disappointment
because
tommy
wants
to
marry
her
you
see
i
see
that
ought
to
be
all
right
you
could
almost
get
two
operas
out
of
that
oo
do
you
think
so
well
it
depends
how
much
reynolds
comes
in
you
did
tell
me
what
happened
to
him
does
he
marry
anybody
oo
no
he
comes
in
because
i
want
somebody
to
tell
the
audience
about
tommy
when
tommy
is
there
how
well
bobby
has
caught
the
dramatic
idea
i
see
he
ought
to
be
very
useful
you
see
the
first
act
in
a
very
grand
restaurant
and
tommy
comes
in
to
have
dinner
and
he
explains
to
reynolds
how
he
met
felicia
on
a
boat
and
she
lost
her
umbrella
and
he
said
this
your
umbrella
and
it
was
and
they
began
to
talk
to
each
other
and
then
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
then
he
goes
out
and
then
reynolds
tells
the
audience
what
an
awfully
decent
chap
tommy
is
why
does
he
go
out
well
you
see
reynolds
could
tell
everybody
what
an
awfully
decent
chap
tommy
is
if
tommy
was
there
of
course
he
could
and
where
felicia
all
this
time
oo
she
does
come
on
she
in
the
country
with
samuel
you
see
the
second
act
is
a
grand
country
wedding
and
samuel
and
phyllis
are
married
and
tommy
is
one
of
the
guests
and
he
very
unhappy
but
he
tries
not
to
show
it
and
he
shoots
himself
reynolds
is
there
too
i
suppose
oo
i
do
know
yet
he
have
to
be
of
course
he
be
wanted
to
tell
the
audience
how
unhappy
tommy
is
and
how
does
it
end
i
asked
well
you
see
when
the
wedding
over
tommy
sings
a
song
about
felicia
and
it
ends
up
felicia
felicia
getting
higher
each
time
short
has
to
do
that
part
of
course
but
i
told
him
about
it
and
then
the
curtain
comes
down
i
see
and
has
short
written
any
of
the
music
yet
he
got
some
of
the
notes
you
see
i
only
just
got
the
plot
and
i
written
about
two
pages
i
writing
it
in
an
a
shadow
passed
suddenly
across
the
author
brow
and
the
sickening
thing
he
said
as
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
sipped
his
is
that
on
the
cover
of
it
i
spelt
disappointment
with
two
the
troubles
of
this
literary
life
sickening
i
agreed
if
there
is
one
form
of
theft
utterly
unforgivable
it
is
the
theft
by
a
writer
of
another
writer
undeveloped
ideas
borrow
the
plot
of
sir
barrie
last
play
and
you
do
him
no
harm
you
only
write
yourself
down
a
plagiarist
but
listen
to
the
scenario
of
his
next
play
if
he
is
kind
enough
to
read
it
to
you
and
write
it
up
before
he
has
time
to
develop
it
himself
and
you
do
him
a
grievous
wrong
for
you
fix
the
charge
of
plagiarism
on
surely
you
say
no
author
could
sink
so
low
as
this
and
yet
when
i
got
home
the
plot
of
disappointment
with
one
s
so
took
hold
of
me
that
i
did
the
unforgivable
thing
i
went
to
my
desk
and
wrote
the
opera
i
make
no
excuses
for
myself
i
only
point
out
that
bobby
opera
as
performed
at
covent
garden
in
italian
with
music
conducted
by
richter
is
not
likely
to
be
belittled
by
anything
that
i
may
write
here
i
have
only
written
in
order
that
i
may
get
the
scenario
which
had
begun
to
haunt
me
off
my
chest
bobby
i
know
will
understand
and
forgive
short
i
have
not
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
but
i
believe
he
is
smaller
than
bobby

poor
tommy

awfully
decent
chap

because
i
happen
to
know

see

but
no
doubt
bobby
and
short
when
they
really
get
to
work
will
make
something
better
of
it
it
is
an
engaging
theme
but
of
course
the
title
wants
to
be
spelt
properly
among
the
animals
jeremy
was
looking
at
a
card
which
his
wife
had
just
passed
across
the
table
to
him
bendish
at
home
he
read
is
this
for
us
of
course
said
jeremy
then
i
think
is
rather
familiar
and
would
have
been
more
correct
do
be
silly
jeremy
it
means
it
a
pet
party
you
have
to
bring
some
sort
of
pet
with
you
and
there
are
prizes
for
the
prettiest
and
the
most
intelligent
and
the
most
companionable
and
so
on
she
looked
at
the
curled
up
in
front
of
the
we
could
take
rags
of
course
or
baby
said
jeremy
we
enter
her
in
the
fat
class
but
when
the
day
arrived
jeremy
had
another
idea
he
came
in
from
the
garden
with
an
important
look
on
his
face
and
joined
his
wife
in
the
hall
come
on
he
said
let
start
but
where
rags
rags
is
coming
i
taking
hereward
instead
he
opened
his
and
disclosed
a
small
green
animal
hereward
he
said
why
jeremy
cried
his
wife
it
why
it
blight
from
the
it
is
just
blight
dear
it
one
particular
blight
a
blight
hereward
the
last
of
the
blights
he
wandered
round
the
hall
the
lead
he
asked
jeremy
do
be
absurd
my
dear
i
must
have
something
to
lead
him
up
for
his
prize
on
during
the
parade
he
can
sit
on
my
shoulder
informally
but
when
we
come
to
the
smith
blight
hereward
must
be
led
on
properly
he
pulled
open
a
drawer
oh
here
we
are
i
better
take
the
chain
he
might
bite
through
the
leather
one
they
arrived
a
little
late
to
find
a
lawn
full
of
people
and
animals
and
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
tell
jeremy
that
in
some
of
the
classes
at
least
his
pet
would
have
many
dangerous
rivals
if
there
a
prize
for
the
biggest
he
said
to
his
wife
my
blight
has
practically
lost
it
already
adams
has
brought
a
hullo
adams
he
went
on
how
are
you
do
come
too
close
or
hereward
may
do
your
animal
a
mischief
who
hereward
jeremy
opened
his
hereward
he
said
not
the
woodbine
that
quite
wild
the
blight
he
much
more
domesticated
but
there
are
moments
when
he
gets
out
of
hand
and
becomes
unmanageable
he
gave
me
the
slip
coming
here
and
i
had
to
chase
him
through
the
churchyard
that
why
we
late
does
he
take
meals
with
the
family
asked
adams
with
a
grin
no
no
he
has
them
alone
in
the
garden
you
ought
to
see
him
having
his
bath
george
our
gardener
looks
after
him
george
gives
him
a
special
bath
of
soapy
water
every
day
hereward
simply
loves
it
george
squirts
on
him
and
hereward
lies
on
his
back
and
kicks
his
legs
in
the
air
it
really
quite
pretty
to
watch
them
he
nodded
to
adams
and
wandered
through
the
crowd
with
jeremy
the
collection
of
animals
was
remarkable
they
varied
in
size
from
to
jeremy
blight
in
playfulness
from
the
vicar
kitten
to
miss
trehearne
chrysalis
and
in
ability
for
performing
tricks
from
the
major
poodle
to
bunton
egg
of
the
cabbage
white
there
ought
to
be
a
race
for
them
all
said
jeremy
a
handicap
of
course
hereward
is
very
fast
over
a
short
distance
said
jeremy
but
he
wants
encouragement
if
he
were
given
yards
two
feet
and
eleven
inches
in
a
hundred
and
you
were
to
stand
in
front
of
him
with
a
william
allan
richardson
i
think
we
might
pull
it
off
but
of
course
he
a
bad
starter
hullo
there
miss
bendish
miss
bendish
hurrying
along
gave
them
a
word
as
she
went
past
they
going
to
have
the
inspection
directly
she
said
and
give
the
prizes
is
your
animal
quite
ready
i
should
like
to
brush
him
up
a
bit
said
jeremy
is
there
a
tent
or
anywhere
where
i
could
prepare
him
his
eyebrows
get
so
matted
if
left
to
himself
for
long
he
took
out
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
there
a
tent
but
you
have
to
hurry
up
oh
well
it
does
really
matter
said
jeremy
as
he
walked
along
with
her
hereward
natural
beauty
and
agility
will
take
him
through
on
the
south
lawn
the
pets
and
their
owners
were
assembling
jeremy
took
the
leash
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
his
good
heavens
he
cried
hereward
has
escaped
quick
shut
the
gates
he
saw
adams
near
and
hurried
up
to
him
my
blight
has
escaped
he
said
breathlessly
holding
up
the
now
useless
leash
he
gnawed
through
the
chain
and
got
away
i
afraid
he
may
be
running
amok
among
the
guests
supposing
he
were
to
leap
upon
sir
thomas
from
behind
and
savage
him
it
too
terrible
he
moved
anxiously
on
have
you
seen
my
blight
he
asked
miss
trehearne
he
has
escaped
and
we
are
rather
anxious
if
he
were
to
get
the
vicar
down
and
begin
to
worry
him
he
murmured
something
about
once
getting
the
taste
for
blood
and
hurried
off
the
guests
were
assembled
and
the
judges
walked
down
the
line
and
inspected
their
different
animals
they
were
almost
at
the
end
of
it
when
jeremy
sprinted
up
and
took
his
place
by
the
last
beast
it
all
right
he
panted
to
his
wife
i
got
him
silly
of
me
to
mislay
him
but
he
so
confoundedly
shy
he
held
out
his
finger
as
the
judges
approached
and
introduced
them
to
the
small
green
pet
perching
on
the
knuckle
a
blight
he
said
hereward
the
chief
blight
been
in
the
family
for
years
a
dear
old
friend
jeremy
went
home
a
proud
man
smith
blight
hereward
had
taken
first
prize
in
the
class
yes
he
admitted
to
his
wife
at
dinner
there
is
something
on
my
mind
he
looked
at
the
handsome
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
and
sighed
what
is
it
dear
you
enjoyed
yourself
this
afternoon
you
know
you
did
and
hereward
won
you
that
beautiful
you
ought
to
be
proud
that
the
trouble
hereward
did
win
it
but
they
said
they
read
it
out
and
yes
but
they
did
know
it
was
really
elspeth
who
won
it
elspeth
yes
dear
jeremy
sighed
again
when
hereward
escaped
and
i
went
back
for
him
i
did
find
him
as
i
er
pretended
so
i
went
to
the
rose
garden
and
and
borrowed
elspeth
fortunately
no
one
noticed
it
was
a
lady
blight
they
all
took
it
for
hereward
but
it
was
really
elspeth
and
belonged
to
lady
bendish
he
helped
himself
to
a
cigarette
from
the
box
it
an
interesting
point
he
said
i
shall
go
and
confess
to
sir
thomas
and
see
what
he
thinks
about
it
if
he
wants
the
box
back
well
and
good
he
refilled
his
glass
after
all
he
said
the
real
blow
is
losing
hereward
elspeth
elspeth
is
very
dear
to
me
but
she
can
never
be
quite
the
same
a
tragedy
of
the
sea
william
bales
as
nice
a
young
man
as
ever
wore
a
cummerbund
on
an
esplanade
was
in
despair
for
half
an
hour
he
and
miss
spratt
had
been
sitting
in
silence
on
the
pier
and
it
was
still
william
turn
to
say
something
miss
spratt
last
remark
had
been
oh
bales
you
do
say
things
and
william
felt
that
his
next
observation
must
at
all
costs
live
up
to
the
standard
set
for
it
three
or
four
times
he
had
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
then
on
second
thoughts
had
rejected
the
intended
utterance
as
unworthy
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
his
mind
was
still
working
fruitlessly
he
knew
that
the
longer
he
waited
the
more
brilliant
he
would
have
to
be
and
he
told
himself
that
even
bernard
shaw
or
one
of
those
clever
writing
fellows
would
have
been
hard
put
to
it
now
william
was
at
odds
with
the
world
he
was
a
romantic
young
man
who
had
once
been
told
that
he
nearly
looked
like
lewis
waller
when
he
frowned
and
he
had
resolved
that
his
holiday
this
year
should
be
a
very
dashing
affair
indeed
he
had
chosen
the
sea
in
the
hopes
that
some
old
gentleman
would
fall
off
the
pier
and
let
himself
be
saved
by
and
later
on
photographed
with
william
bales
who
in
a
subsequent
interview
would
modestly
refuse
to
take
any
credit
for
the
gallant
rescue
as
his
holiday
had
progressed
he
had
felt
the
need
for
some
such
old
gentleman
more
and
more
for
only
thus
he
realised
could
he
capture
the
heart
of
the
wayward
miss
spratt
but
so
far
it
had
been
a
dull
season
in
a
whole
fortnight
nobody
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
oblige
william
and
he
must
return
to
the
city
as
unknown
and
as
unloved
as
when
he
left
it
got
to
go
back
he
said
at
last
as
an
impromptu
it
would
have
served
but
as
the
result
of
half
an
hour
earnest
thought
he
felt
that
it
did
not
do
him
justice
so
you
said
before
remarked
miss
spratt
well
it
still
true
talking
about
it
wo
help
it
said
miss
spratt
william
sighed
and
looked
round
the
pier
there
was
an
old
gentleman
fishing
at
the
end
of
it
his
back
turned
invitingly
to
william
in
half
an
hour
he
had
caught
one
small
fish
which
he
had
had
to
return
as
under
the
age
limit
and
a
bunch
of
seaweed
william
felt
that
there
was
a
wasted
life
a
life
however
which
a
sudden
kick
and
a
heroic
rescue
by
bales
might
yet
do
something
to
justify
at
the
paddington
baths
a
month
ago
he
had
won
a
competition
and
though
there
is
a
difference
between
diving
for
plates
and
diving
for
old
gentlemen
he
was
prepared
to
waive
it
one
kick
and
then
fame
and
not
only
fame
but
the
admiration
of
angelina
spratt
it
was
perhaps
as
well
for
the
old
gentleman
who
was
really
quite
worthy
and
an
hour
later
caught
a
whiting
that
miss
spratt
spoke
at
this
moment
well
you
good
company
i
must
say
she
observed
to
william
it
so
hot
said
william
you
ca
say
asked
to
come
here
let
go
on
the
beach
said
william
desperately
we
can
find
a
shady
cave
or
something
fate
was
against
him
there
was
to
be
no
rescue
that
day
i
sure
i
agreeable
said
miss
spratt
they
walked
in
silence
along
the
beach
and
rounding
a
corner
of
the
cliffs
they
came
presently
to
a
cave
in
earlier
days
bales
could
have
done
desperate
deeds
against
smugglers
there
with
miss
spratt
looking
on
alas
for
this
unromantic
age
it
was
now
a
place
for
picnics
and
a
crumpled
sheet
of
newspaper
on
the
sand
showed
that
there
had
been
one
there
that
very
afternoon
they
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
cave
out
of
the
sun
out
of
sight
of
the
sea
and
william
prepared
to
renew
his
efforts
as
a
conversationalist
in
the
hope
of
collecting
a
few
ideas
as
to
what
the
london
clubs
were
talking
about
he
picked
up
the
discarded
newspaper
and
saw
with
disgust
that
it
was
the
local
but
just
as
he
threw
it
down
a
line
in
it
caught
his
eye
and
remained
in
his
mind
tide
william
heart
leapt
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
in
one
hour
the
waves
would
be
dashing
remorselessly
into
the
cave
would
be
leaping
up
the
cliff
what
time
he
and
miss
spratt
suppose
they
were
caught
by
the
tide
meanwhile
the
lady
despairing
of
entertainment
had
removed
her
hat
really
she
said
i
that
sleepy
i
suppose
the
tide
safe
mr
bales
it
was
william
chance
quite
quite
safe
he
said
earnestly
it
going
down
hard
well
then
i
almost
think
she
closed
her
eyes
wake
me
up
when
you
thought
of
something
really
funny
mr
bales
william
was
left
alone
with
romance
he
went
out
of
the
cave
and
looked
round
the
sea
was
still
some
way
out
but
it
came
up
quickly
on
this
coast
in
an
hour
in
an
hour
he
scanned
the
cliffs
and
saw
the
ledge
whither
he
would
drag
her
she
would
cling
to
him
crying
calling
him
her
rescuer
what
should
he
do
then
should
he
leave
her
and
swim
for
help
or
should
he
scale
the
mighty
cliff
he
returned
to
the
cave
and
gazing
romantically
at
the
sleeping
miss
spratt
conjured
up
the
scene
it
would
go
like
this
he
thought
by
the
spray
dashing
over
her
oh
bales
we
cut
off
by
the
tide
save
me
there
no
danger
it
nothing
great
heavens
death
stares
us
in
the
face
her
arms
around
his
william
save
me
i
can
not
swim
waller
trust
me
angelina
i
will
fight
my
way
round
yon
point
and
obtain
help
an
englishman
can
only
die
once
do
leave
me
fear
not
sweetheart
see
there
is
a
ledge
where
you
will
be
beyond
the
reach
of
the
hungry
tide
i
will
carry
you
thither
in
my
arms
and
will
then
at
this
point
in
his
william
took
another
look
at
the
sleeping
miss
spratt
felt
his
biceps
doubtfully
and
went
on
i
will
help
you
to
climb
thither
and
will
then
swim
for
help
my
hero
again
and
again
william
reviewed
the
scene
to
himself
it
was
perfect
his
photograph
would
be
in
the
papers
miss
spratt
would
worship
him
he
would
be
a
hero
in
his
city
office
the
actual
danger
was
slight
for
at
the
worst
she
could
shelter
in
the
far
end
of
the
cave
but
he
would
not
let
her
know
this
he
would
do
the
thing
heroically
drag
her
to
the
ledge
on
the
cliff
and
then
swim
round
the
point
to
obtain
help
the
thought
struck
him
that
he
could
conduct
the
scene
better
in
his
he
removed
his
coat
and
then
went
out
of
the
cave
to
reconnoitre
the
ledge
miss
spratt
awoke
with
a
start
and
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
the
cave
was
empty
save
for
a
crumpled
page
of
newspaper
she
glanced
at
this
idly
and
saw
that
it
was
the
local
eight
days
old
far
away
on
the
horizon
william
bales
was
throwing
stones
bitterly
at
the
still
retreating
sea
old
friends
it
was
very
nice
of
you
to
invite
me
to
give
you
lunch
i
said
and
if
only
the
waiter
would
bring
the
toast
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
i
ca
say
more
why
not
said
miss
middleton
looking
up
oh
i
see
and
now
i
said
when
i
had
finished
my
business
with
a
sardine
tell
me
all
about
it
i
know
something
serious

have
brought
you
up
to
london
what
is
it

you
run
away
from
home
miss
middleton
nodded
sir
henery
she
added
dramatically
waits
for
me
in
his
yacht
at
dover
my
parents
would
not
hear
of
the
marriage
and
immured
me
in
the
spare
room
they
tried
to
turn
me
against
my
love
and
told
wicked
stories
about
him
vowing
that
he
smoked
five
cigarettes
in
a
day
er
would
you
pass
the
pepper
please
go
on
i
begged
never
mind
the
pepper
but
of
course
i
really
came
to
see
you
said
miss
middleton
briskly
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
i
knew
it
oh
say
you
love
to
i
drained
my
glass
and
felt
very
brave
i
love
to
i
said
doubtfully
at
least
if
i
were
sure
that
i
lowered
my
voice
look
here

i
got
to
write
to
anybody
no
said
miss
middleton
let
me
know
the
worst
have
i
er
have
i
got
to
give
advice
to
anybody
no
there
was
one
other
point
that
had
to
be
settled
i
leant
across
the
table
anxiously
have
i
got
to
ring
anybody
up
on
the
telephone
i
asked
in
a
hoarse
whisper
oh
nothing
like
that

all
said
miss
middleton

it
i
cried
then
of
i
do
anything
for
you
what
is
it
somebody
you
want
killed
i
could
kill
a
mayor
miss
middleton
was
silent
for
a
moment
while
allowing
herself
to
be
helped
to
fish
when
the
waiters
had
moved
away
we
are
having
a
jumble
sale
she
announced
i
shook
my
head
at
her
your
life
i
said
is
one
constant
round
of
gaiety
and
i
thought
as
i
was
coming
to
london
i
mention
it
to
you
because
you
always
saying
you
do
know
what
to
do
with
your
old
things
i
not
saying
it
i
may
have
mentioned
it
once
or
twice
when
the
conversation
was
flagging
well
mention
it
now
and
then
i
mention
my
jumble
sale
i
thought
it
over
for
a
moment
it
will
mean
brown
paper
and
string
i
said
hopelessly
and
i
know
where
to
get
them
i
buy
some
after
lunch
for
you
you
shall
hold
my
hand
while
i
buy
it
and
then
i
should
have
to
post
it
and
i
at
posting
things
but
you
need
post
it
because
you
can
meet
me
at
the
station
with
it
and
i
take
it
home
i
do
think
it
quite
etiquette
for
a
young
girl
to
travel
alone
with
a
big
parcel
what
would
middleton
say
if
she
knew
mother
cried
miss
middleton
but
of
course
it
her
idea
you
think
it
was
mine
she
said
reproachfully
the
shock
of
it
unnerved
me
for
a
moment
of
course
i
see
now
that
it
is
middleton
jumble
sale
entirely
i
sighed
and
helped
myself
to
salt
how
do
i
begin
you
drive
me
to
my
dressmaker
and
leave
me
there
and
go
on
to
your
rooms
and
then
you
collect
a
few
really
old
things
that
you
do
want
and
tie
them
up
and
meet
me
at
the
i
afraid
she
said
frankly
it
a
rotten
way
of
spending
an
afternoon
but
i
promised
mother
i
do
it
i
said
my
parcel
and
i
arrived
promptly
to
time
miss
middleton
did
do
say
i
caught
the
wrong
train
she
said
breathlessly
when
at
last
she
appeared
it
does
go
at
does
it
it
does
i
said
and
it
did
then
my
watch
must
be
slow
send
it
to
the
jumble
sale
i
advised
look
here
we
a
long
time
to
wait
for
the
next
train
let
undress
my
parcel
in
the
and
i
point
out
the
things
that
really
want
watching
some
are
absolutely
unique
it
was
an
odd
collection
of
very
dear
friends
miss
middleton
final
reminder
having
been
that
was
too
old
for
a
jumble
sale
i
said
a
photograph
of
my
house
cricket
eleven
framed
in
oak
very
interesting
the
lad
on
the
extreme
right
is
now
a
clergyman
oh
which
is
you
said
miss
middleton
eagerly
i
was
too
much
wrapped
up
in
my
parcel
to
answer
i
went
on
a
football
shirt
would
work
up
into
a
dressy
blouse
for
adult
or
a
smart
overcoat
for
child
a
knitted
waistcoat
could
be
used
as
pair
of
bedroom
slippers
in
holes
this
bit
is
the
slipper
the
rest
is
the
hole
now
this
is
something
really
good
my
first
prize
at
my
kindergarten
mother
in
luck
it
just
the
sort
of
things
she
wants
said
miss
middleton
her
taste
is
excellent
a
pair
of
old
grey
flannel
trousers
lot
seven
forward
where
are
you
i
began
to
go
through
the
things
again
er
i
afraid
lot
seven
has
already
gone
what
about
lot
eight
there
does
seem
to
be
a
lot
eight
either
it
very
funny
i
sure
i
started
with
more
than
this
some
of
the
things
must
have
eaten
each
other
on
the
way
oh
but
this
is
can
you
really
spare
them
all
i
should
feel
honoured
if
middleton
would
accept
them
i
said
with
a
bow
do
forget
to
tell
her
that
in
the
photograph
the
lad
on
the
extreme
right
i
picked
up
the
photograph
and
examined
it
more
carefully
i
say
look
rather
jolly
do
you
think
i
wonder
if
i
have
another
copy
of
this
anywhere
i
gazed
at
it
wistfully
that
was
my
first
year
for
the
house
you
know
do
give
it
away
said
miss
middleton
suddenly
keep
it
shall
i
i
do
want
to
deprive
well
i
think
i
will
if
you
mind
my
eyes
wandered
to
the
shirt
i
had
some
fun
in
in
my
time
i
said
thoughtfully
the
first
time
i
wore
it
you
really
to
give
away
your
old
colours
you
know
oh
but
if
middleton
i
began
doubtfully
at
least
you
what
oh
all
right
perhaps
i
wo
i
put
the
shirt
on
one
side
with
the
photograph
and
picked
up
the
dear
old
comfy
bedroom
slippers
i
considered
them
for
a
minute
and
then
i
sighed
deeply
as
i
looked
up
i
caught
miss
middleton
eye
i
think
she
had
been
smiling
about
the
slippers
she
said
gravely
i
said
to
miss
middleton
it
been
jolly
to
see
you
i
grasped
my
parcel
firmly
as
the
train
began
to
move
i
always
glad
to
help
middleton
and
if
ever
i
can
do
so
again
be
sure
to
let
me
know
i
will
said
miss
middleton
the
train
went
out
of
the
station
and
my
parcel
and
i
looked
about
for
a
cab
getting
married
getting
married
the
day
probably
you
thought
that
getting
married
was
quite
a
simple
business
so
did
i
we
were
both
wrong
it
is
the
very
dickens
of
course
i
am
not
going
to
draw
back
now
as
i
keep
telling
celia
her
ronald
is
a
man
of
powerful
fibre
and
when
he
says
he
will
do
a
thing
he
does
it
eventually
she
shall
have
her
wedding
all
right
i
have
sworn
it
but
i
do
wish
that
there
were
so
many
things
to
be
arranged
first
the
fact
that
we
had
to
fix
a
day
was
broken
to
me
one
afternoon
when
celia
was
showing
me
to
some
relatives
of
hers
in
the
addison
road
i
got
entangled
with
an
elderly
cousin
on
the
and
though
i
know
nothing
about
i
talked
about
them
for
several
hours
under
the
impression
that
they
were
his
subject
it
turned
out
afterwards
that
he
was
equally
ignorant
of
them
but
thought
they
were
mine
perhaps
we
shall
get
on
better
at
a
second
meeting
however
just
when
we
were
both
thoroughly
sick
of
each
other
celia
broke
off
her
gay
chat
with
an
aunt
to
say
to
me
by
the
way
ronald
we
did
settle
on
the
eleventh
did
we
i
looked
at
her
blankly
my
mind
naturally
full
of
the
wedding
smiled
celia
i
said
with
enthusiasm
i
was
glad
to
be
assured
that
i
should
not
go
on
talking
about
for
ever
and
that
on
the
eleventh
anyhow
there
would
be
a
short
interruption
for
the
ceremony
feeling
almost
friendly
to
the
cousin
i
plunged
into
his
favourite
subject
again
on
the
way
home
celia
returned
to
the
matter
or
you
would
rather
it
was
the
twelfth
she
asked
i
never
heard
a
word
about
this
before
i
said
it
all
comes
as
a
surprise
to
me
why
i
asking
you
well
it
very
forward
of
you
and
i
do
know
what
young
people
are
coming
to
nowadays
celia
what
the
of
my
talking
to
your
cousin
for
three
hours
about
surely
one
can
get
married
just
as
well
without
that
one
ca
get
married
without
settling
the
day
said
celia
coming
cleverly
back
to
the
point
well
i
suppose
one
ca
but
somehow
i
had
expected
to
be
spared
all
this
bother
i
think
my
idea
was
that
celia
would
say
to
me
suddenly
one
evening
by
the
way
ronald
do
forget
we
being
married
and
i
should
have
said
where
and
on
being
told
the
time
and
place
i
should
have
turned
up
pretty
punctually
and
after
my
best
man
had
told
me
where
to
stand
and
the
clergyman
had
told
me
what
to
say
and
my
solicitor
had
told
me
where
to
sign
my
name
we
should
have
driven
from
the
church
a
happy
married
couple
and
in
the
carriage
celia
would
have
told
me
where
we
were
spending
the
honeymoon
however
it
was
not
to
be
so
all
right
the
eleventh
i
said
any
particular
month
no
smiled
celia
just
any
month
or
if
you
like
every
month
the
eleventh
of
june
i
surmised
it
is
probably
the
one
day
in
the
year
on
which
my
uncle
thomas
can
not
come
but
no
matter
the
eleventh
let
it
be
then
that
settled
and
at
st
miriam
for
some
reason
celia
has
set
her
heart
on
miriam
personally
i
have
no
feeling
about
it
or
would
suit
me
equally
well
all
right
i
said
st
miriam
there
you
might
suppose
the
matter
would
have
ended
but
no
then
you
will
see
about
it
said
celia
persuasively
i
was
appalled
at
the
idea
surely
i
said
this
is
for
you
or
your
father
or
or
somebody
to
arrange
of
it
for
the
bridegroom
protested
celia
in
theory
perhaps
but
anyhow
not
the
bridegroom
personally
his
best
man
or
his
solicitor
or
i
mean
you
not
suggesting
that
i
myself
oh
well
if
you
insist
still
i
must
say
i
do
see
the
good
of
having
a
best
man
a
solicitor
if
oh
all
right
celia
i
go
so
i
went
for
half
an
hour
i
padded
round
miriam
nervously
and
then
summoning
up
all
my
courage
i
knocked
my
pipe
out
and
entered
i
want
i
said
jauntily
to
a
sexton
or
a
sacristan
or
something
i
want
er
a
wedding
and
i
added
for
two
he
did
seem
as
nervous
as
i
was
he
enquired
quite
calmly
when
i
wanted
it
the
eleventh
of
june
i
said
it
probably
the
one
day
in
the
year
on
which
my
uncle
thomas
however
that
would
interest
you
the
point
is
that
it
the
eleventh
the
clerk
consulted
his
then
he
made
the
surprising
announcement
that
the
only
day
he
could
offer
me
in
june
was
the
seventeenth
i
was
amazed
i
am
a
very
old
customer
i
said
reproachfully
i
mean
i
have
often
been
to
your
church
in
my
time
surely
we
weddings
fixed
on
all
the
other
days
yes
yes
but
you
could
persuade
somebody
to
change
his
day
you
or
if
he
is
very
much
set
on
being
married
on
the
eleventh
you
might
recommend
some
other
church
to
him
i
daresay
you
know
of
some
good
ones
you
see
celia
my
that
is
we
particularly
keen
for
some
reason
on
st
miriam
the
clerk
did
appreciate
my
suggestion
he
insisted
that
the
seventeenth
was
the
only
day
then
will
you
have
the
seventeenth
he
asked
my
dear
fellow
i
ca
possibly
say
i
protested
i
am
not
alone
in
this
i
have
a
friend
with
me
i
will
go
back
and
tell
her
what
you
say
she
may
decide
to
withdraw
her
offer
altogether
i
went
back
and
told
celia
bother
she
said
what
shall
we
do
there
are
other
churches
there
your
own
for
example
yes
but
you
know
i
do
like
that
why
we
be
married
on
the
seventeenth
i
do
know
at
all
it
seems
an
excellent
day
it
lets
in
my
uncle
thomas
of
course
it
may
exclude
my
uncle
william
but
one
ca
have
everything
then
will
you
go
and
fix
it
for
the
seventeenth
ca
i
send
my
solicitor
this
time
i
asked
of
course
if
you
particularly
want
me
to
go
myself
i
will
but
really
dear
i
seem
to
be
living
at
miriam
nowadays
and
even
that
was
the
end
of
the
business
for
just
as
i
was
leaving
her
celia
broke
it
to
me
that
miriam
was
neither
in
her
parish
nor
in
mine
and
that
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
bridegroom
i
should
have
to
hire
a
room
somewhere
near
but
i
am
very
comfortable
where
i
am
i
assured
her
you
need
live
there
ronald
you
only
want
to
leave
a
hat
there
you
know
oh
very
well
i
sighed
she
came
to
the
hall
with
me
and
having
said
to
her
i
repeated
my
lesson
the
seventeenth
fix
it
up
take
a
room
near
miriam
and
leave
a
hat
there
and
oh
ronald
she
looked
at
me
critically
as
i
stood
in
the
doorway
you
might
leave
one
she
said
furnishing
by
the
way
said
celia
suddenly
what
have
you
done
about
the
fixtures
nothing
i
replied
truthfully
well
we
must
do
about
them
yes
my
solicitor
he
shall
do
something
about
them
do
let
talk
about
them
now
i
only
got
three
hours
more
with
you
and
then
i
must
dash
back
to
my
work
i
must
say
that
any
mention
of
fixtures
has
always
bored
me
intensely
when
it
was
a
matter
of
getting
a
house
to
live
in
i
was
all
energy
as
soon
as
celia
had
found
it
i
put
my
solicitor
on
to
it
and
within
a
month
i
had
signed
my
name
in
two
places
and
was
the
owner
of
a
highly
residential
flat
in
the
best
part
of
the
neighbourhood
but
my
effort
so
exhausted
me
that
i
have
felt
utterly
unable
since
to
cope
with
the
question
of
the
in
the
bathroom
or
whatever
it
is
that
celia
means
by
fixtures
these
things
will
arrange
themselves
somehow
i
feel
confident
meanwhile
the
decorators
are
hard
at
work
a
thrill
of
pride
inflates
me
when
i
think
of
the
decorators
at
work
i
do
know
how
they
got
there
i
suppose
i
must
have
ordered
them
celia
says
that
ordered
them
and
chose
all
the
papers
herself
and
that
all
i
did
was
to
say
that
the
papers
she
had
chosen
were
very
pretty
but
this
does
sound
like
me
in
the
least
i
am
convinced
that
i
was
the
man
of
action
when
it
came
to
ordering
decorators
and
now
said
celia
one
day
we
can
go
and
choose
the
fittings
celia
i
said
in
admiration
you
a
wonderful
person
i
should
have
forgotten
all
about
them
why
they
about
the
most
important
thing
in
the
flat
somehow
i
never
regarded
anybody
as
choosing
them
i
thought
they
just
grew
in
the
wall
from
bulbs
when
we
got
into
the
shop
celia
became
businesslike
at
once
we
better
start
with
the
hall
she
told
the
man
everybody
else
will
have
to
i
said
so
we
may
as
well
what
sort
of
a
light
did
you
want
there
he
asked
a
strong
one
i
said
so
as
to
be
able
to
watch
our
guests
carefully
when
they
pass
the
celia
waved
me
away
and
explained
that
we
wanted
a
hanging
lantern
it
appeared
that
this
shop
made
a
speciality
not
so
much
of
the
voltage
as
of
the
lamps
enclosing
it
how
do
you
like
that
asked
the
man
pointing
to
a
magnificent
affair
in
brass
he
wandered
off
to
a
switch
and
turned
it
on
dare
you
ask
him
the
price
i
asked
celia
it
looks
to
me
about
a
thousand
pounds
if
it
is
say
that
you
do
like
the
style
do
let
him
think
we
ca
afford
it
yes
said
celia
in
a
careless
sort
of
way
i
not
sure
that
i
care
about
that
how
much
is
it
two
pounds
i
was
not
going
to
show
my
relief
without
the
light
of
course
i
said
disparagingly
how
do
you
think
it
would
look
in
the
hall
said
celia
to
me
i
think
our
guests
would
be
encouraged
to
proceed
they
see
that
we
were
pretty
good
people
i
do
like
it
it
too
ornate
then
show
us
something
less
ornate
i
told
the
man
sternly
he
showed
us
things
less
ornate
at
the
end
of
an
hour
celia
said
she
thought
we
better
get
on
to
another
room
and
come
back
to
the
hall
afterwards
we
decided
to
proceed
to
the
we
must
go
all
out
over
these
said
celia
i
want
these
to
be
really
beautiful
at
the
end
of
another
hour
celia
said
she
thought
we
better
get
on
to
my
workroom
my
workroom
as
the
name
implies
is
the
room
to
which
i
am
to
retire
when
i
want
complete
quiet
sometimes
i
shall
go
there
after
lunch
and
have
it
we
can
come
back
to
the
afterwards
she
said
really
very
important
that
we
should
get
the
right
ones
for
that
your
room
wo
be
so
difficult
but
of
course
you
must
have
awfully
nice
ones
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
a
quarter
to
one
i
said
at
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
we
are
due
at
miriam
if
you
think
we
shall
have
bought
anything
by
then
let
go
on
if
as
seems
to
me
there
is
no
hope
at
all
then
let
have
lunch
anyhow
after
lunch
we
may
be
able
to
find
some
way
out
of
the
after
lunch
i
had
an
idea
this
afternoon
i
said
we
will
begin
to
get
some
furniture
together
but
what
about
the
electric
fittings
we
must
finish
off
those
this
is
an
experiment
i
want
to
see
if
we
can
buy
a
chest
of
drawers
it
may
just
be
our
day
for
it
and
we
settle
the
fittings
yes
i
do
know
we
may
not
want
them
it
all
depends
on
whether
we
can
buy
a
chest
of
drawers
this
afternoon
if
we
ca
then
i
do
see
how
we
can
ever
be
married
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
somebody
got
to
be
because
i
engaged
the
church
the
question
is
whether
it
going
to
be
us
let
go
and
buy
a
chest
of
drawers
this
afternoon
and
see
the
old
gentleman
in
the
little
shop
celia
knew
of
was
delighted
to
see
us
chestesses
ah
you
come
to
the
right
place
he
led
the
way
into
the
depths
there
now
there
a
chest
real
old
that
is
he
gave
it
a
hearty
smack
you
do
see
a
chest
like
that
nowadays
they
ca
three
pound
ten
you
could
have
got
that
i
have
sold
it
for
four
pound
i
knew
it
was
our
day
i
said
real
old
that
is
spanish
all
oak
lined
that
right
sir
pull
the
drawers
out
and
see
for
yourself
let
the
lady
see
there
no
imitation
there
lady
a
real
old
chest
that
is
come
in
in
a
week
and
you
have
to
pay
five
pounds
for
it
going
up
you
see
that
how
well
i
said
to
celia
it
perfectly
sweet
had
we
better
see
some
more
we
saw
two
more
both
of
them
spanish
oak
lined
half
an
hour
passed
rapidly
well
i
said
i
really
do
know
which
i
like
best
which
do
you
the
first
it
nearer
the
door
there
another
shop
just
over
the
way
we
better
just
look
there
too
and
then
we
can
come
back
to
decide
we
went
out
i
glanced
at
my
watch
it
was
and
we
were
being
married
at
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
wait
a
moment
i
said
i
forgotten
my
gloves
i
may
be
a
slow
starter
but
i
am
very
firm
when
roused
i
went
into
the
shop
wrote
a
cheque
for
the
three
chests
of
drawers
and
told
the
man
where
to
send
them
when
i
returned
celia
was
at
the
shop
opposite
pulling
the
drawers
out
of
a
real
old
mahogany
chest
which
was
standing
on
the
pavement
outside
this
is
even
better
she
said
it
perfectly
adorable
i
wonder
if
it
more
expensive
i
just
ask
i
said
i
went
in
and
without
an
unnecessary
word
bought
that
chest
too
then
i
came
back
to
celia
it
was
and
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
at
well
we
had
four
chests
of
drawers
towards
it
celia
i
said
we
may
just
do
it
yet
the
honeymoon
i
know
i
ought
to
be
dallying
here
i
said
i
ought
to
be
doing
something
strenuous
in
preparation
for
the
wedding
counting
the
bells
at
miriam
or
varnishing
the
floors
in
the
flat
or
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
be
doing
celia
and
i
go
on
not
doing
it
for
a
bit
there
the
honeymoon
said
celia
i
knew
there
was
something
do
tell
me
what
you
doing
about
it
thinking
about
it
you
have
written
to
any
one
about
rooms
yet
celia
i
said
reproachfully
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
why
i
am
marrying
you
when
celia
was
browbeaten
into
her
present
engagement
she
said
frankly
that
she
was
only
consenting
to
marry
me
because
of
my
pianola
which
she
had
always
coveted
in
return
i
pointed
out
that
i
was
only
asking
her
to
marry
me
because
i
wanted
somebody
to
write
my
letters
there
opened
before
me
in
that
glad
moment
a
vista
of
invitations
and
all
answered
promptly
by
celia
instead
of
put
off
till
next
month
by
me
it
was
a
wonderful
vision
to
one
who
very
properly
detests
and
yet
here
she
was
even
before
the
ceremony
expecting
me
to
enter
into
a
deliberate
correspondence
with
all
sorts
of
strange
people
who
as
yet
had
not
come
into
my
life
at
all
it
was
too
much
we
will
get
i
said
your
father
to
write
some
letters
for
us
but
what
he
got
to
do
with
it
i
do
want
to
complain
of
your
father
celia
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
not
doing
his
fair
share
there
ought
to
be
a
certain
in
the
matter
find
you
a
nice
church
to
be
married
in
good
finds
you
a
nice
place
to
honeymoon
in
excellent
after
all
you
are
still
his
daughter
all
right
said
celia
i
ask
father
to
do
it
bunn
my
little
boy
wants
to
spend
his
holidays
with
you
in
june
i
am
writing
to
ask
you
if
you
will
take
care
of
him
and
see
that
he
does
do
anything
dangerous
he
has
a
nice
disposition
but
wants
watching
she
patted
my
head
gently
something
like
that
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
i
can
see
i
shall
have
to
do
it
myself
i
sighed
give
me
the
address
and
i
begin
but
we
have
quite
settled
where
we
going
yet
have
we
i
put
the
pen
down
thankfully
and
went
back
to
the
sofa
good
then
i
need
write
anyhow
it
is
wonderful
dear
how
difficulties
roll
away
when
you
face
them
almost
at
once
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
i
need
write
splendid
well
where
shall
we
go
this
will
want
a
lot
of
thought
perhaps
i
added
i
write
we
had
almost
fixed
on
england
had
we
somebody
was
telling
me
that
lynton
was
very
beautiful
i
should
like
to
go
to
lynton
but
goes
to
lynton
for
their
honeymoon
then
let
be
original
and
go
to
birmingham
happy
couple
left
for
birmingham
where
the
honeymoon
will
be
spent
sensation
bride
left
the
train
at
ealing
more
sensation
i
think
the
great
thing
i
said
trying
to
be
businesslike
is
to
fix
the
county
first
if
we
fixed
on
rutland
then
the
rest
would
probably
be
easy
the
great
thing
said
celia
is
to
decide
what
we
want
sea
or
river
or
mountains
or
or
golf
at
the
word
golf
i
coughed
and
looked
out
of
the
window
now
i
am
very
fond
of
celia
i
mean
of
golf
and
what
i
really
mean
of
course
is
that
i
am
very
fond
of
both
of
them
but
i
do
think
that
on
a
honeymoon
celia
should
come
first
after
all
i
shall
have
plenty
of
other
holidays
for
golf
although
of
course
three
weeks
in
the
summer
without
any
golf
at
all
still
i
think
celia
should
come
first
our
trouble
i
said
to
her
is
that
neither
of
us
has
ever
been
on
a
honeymoon
before
and
so
we
no
idea
what
it
will
be
like
after
all
why
should
we
get
bored
with
each
other
surely
we
do
depend
on
golf
to
amuse
us
all
the
same
i
think
your
golf
amuse
me
said
celia
besides
i
want
you
to
be
as
happy
as
you
possibly
can
be
yes
but
supposing
i
was
slicing
my
drives
all
the
time
i
should
be
miserable
i
should
be
torn
between
the
desire
to
go
back
to
london
and
have
a
lesson
with
the
professional
and
the
desire
to
stay
on
honeymooning
with
you
one
ca
be
happy
in
a
quandary
like
that
very
well
then
no
golf
settled
quite
now
then
let
decide
about
the
scenery
what
sort
of
soil
do
you
prefer
when
i
left
celia
that
day
we
had
agreed
on
this
much
that
we
bother
about
golf
and
that
the
mountains
rivers
valleys
and
so
on
should
be
left
entirely
to
nature
all
we
were
to
enquire
for
was
in
the
words
of
an
advertisement
celia
had
seen
a
perfect
spot
for
a
honeymoon
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
i
heard
of
seven
spots
varying
from
a
spot
in
surrey
dotted
with
firs
to
a
dot
in
the
pacific
spotted
with
i
forget
what
natives
probably
taken
together
they
were
the
seven
only
possible
spots
for
a
honeymoon
we
shall
have
to
have
seven
honeymoons
i
said
to
celia
when
i
had
told
her
my
news
one
honeymoon
one
spot
wait
she
said
i
have
heard
of
an
ideal
spot
speaking
as
a
spot
expert
i
do
think
that
necessarily
better
than
an
only
possible
spot
i
objected
still
tell
me
about
it
well
to
begin
with
it
close
to
the
sea
so
we
can
bathe
when
we
bored
good
and
it
got
a
river
if
you
want
to
fish
i
do
i
should
hate
to
catch
a
fish
who
was
perhaps
on
his
honeymoon
too
still
i
like
the
idea
of
a
river
and
quite
a
good
mountain
and
lovely
walks
and
in
fact
everything
except
a
luckily
it
sounds
all
right
i
said
doubtfully
we
might
just
spend
the
next
day
or
two
thinking
about
my
seven
spots
and
then
i
might
possibly
feel
strong
enough
to
write
oh
i
nearly
forgot
i
written
ronald
you
have
i
cried
then
my
dear
what
else
matters
it
a
perfect
spot
i
lay
back
in
relief
and
there
thank
is
another
thing
settled
bless
you
yes
and
by
the
way
there
golf
quite
close
too
but
that
she
smiled
need
prevent
us
going
there
of
course
not
we
shall
just
ignore
the
course
perhaps
so
as
to
be
on
the
safe
side
you
better
leave
your
clubs
behind
perhaps
i
better
i
said
carelessly
all
the
same
i
do
think
i
will
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
and
at
the
outset
of
one
matrimonial
career
to
have
to
go
to
the
expense
of
an
entirely
new
set
of
clubs
would
be
a
most
regrettable
business
seasonable
presents
i
suppose
i
said
it
too
late
to
cancel
this
wedding
now
well
said
celia
the
invitations
are
out
and
the
presents
are
pouring
in
and
mother
just
ordered
the
most
melting
dress
for
herself
that
you
ever
saw
besides
who
to
live
in
the
flat
if
we
do
there
a
good
deal
in
what
you
say
still
i
am
alarmed
seriously
alarmed
look
here
i
drew
out
a
printed
slip
and
flourished
it
before
her
not
a
writ
my
poor
ronald
worse
than
that
this
is
the
miriam
bill
of
fare
for
weddings
celia
i
had
no
idea
marriage
was
so
expensive
i
thought
one
ring
would
practically
see
it
it
was
a
formidable
document
starting
with
full
choir
and
organ
which
came
to
a
million
pounds
and
working
down
through
boys
voices
only
and
red
carpet
to
policemen
for
controlling
traffic
per
policeman
it
included
altogether
some
two
dozen
ways
of
disposing
of
my
savings
if
we
have
the
whole
i
said
i
shall
be
ruined
you
like
to
have
a
ruined
husband
celia
took
the
list
and
went
through
it
carefully
i
might
say
i
suggested
or
well
to
begin
with
said
celia
we
need
have
a
full
choir
need
we
have
an
organ
or
a
choir
at
all
in
thanking
people
for
their
kind
presents
you
might
add
the
way
do
you
sing
then
we
could
arrange
to
have
all
the
warblers
in
the
front
my
best
man
or
my
solicitor
could
give
the
note
boys
voices
only
decided
celia
then
what
about
bells
i
should
like
some
nice
bells
if
the
price
is
bell
we
might
give
an
order
for
five
good
ones
let
do
without
bells
you
see
they
do
begin
to
ring
till
left
the
church
so
they
wo
be
any
good
to
this
seemed
to
me
an
extraordinary
line
to
take
my
dear
child
i
remonstrated
the
whole
thing
is
being
got
up
not
for
ourselves
but
for
our
guests
we
shall
be
much
too
preoccupied
to
appreciate
any
of
the
good
things
we
provide
the
texture
of
the
red
carpet
or
the
quality
of
the
singing
i
dreamt
last
night
that
i
quite
forgot
about
the
till
on
the
actual
day
and
the
only
cab
i
could
find
to
take
me
to
a
jeweller
was
drawn
by
a
camel
of
course
it
may
not
turn
out
to
be
as
bad
as
that
but
it
will
certainly
be
an
anxious
afternoon
for
both
of
us
and
so
we
must
consider
the
entertainment
entirely
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
guests
whether
their
craving
is
for
champagne
or
bells
it
must
be
satisfied
i
sure
they
be
better
without
bells
because
when
the
policemen
call
out
spifkins
carriage
spifkins
might
hear
if
there
were
a
lot
of
bells
clashing
about
very
well
no
bells
but
mind
you
i
said
sternly
i
shall
insist
on
a
clergyman
we
went
through
the
rest
of
the
course
by
course
i
know
what
i
shall
do
i
said
at
last
i
shall
call
on
my
friend
the
clerk
again
and
i
shall
speak
to
him
quite
frankly
i
shall
say
is
a
cheque
for
a
thousand
pounds
it
is
all
i
can
afford
and
by
the
way
you
better
pay
it
in
quickly
or
it
will
be
dishonoured
can
you
do
us
up
a
nice
wedding
for
a
thousand
inclusive
like
the
christmas
hampers
at
the
stores
exactly
a
dozen
boys
voices
a
of
bells
ten
yards
of
awning
and
oranges
or
vergers
or
whatever
it
is
we
ought
to
get
a
nice
parcel
for
a
thousand
pounds
or
said
celia
we
might
send
the
list
round
to
our
friends
as
suggestions
for
wedding
presents
i
sure
jane
would
love
to
give
us
a
couple
of
policemen
we
much
better
leave
the
whole
thing
to
your
father
i
incline
more
and
more
to
the
opinion
that
it
is
business
to
provide
the
wedding
i
must
ask
my
solicitor
about
it
he
providing
the
bride
yes
but
i
think
he
might
go
further
i
ca
help
feeling
that
the
bells
would
come
very
well
from
him
father
to
bridegroom
a
peal
of
bells
people
would
think
it
was
something
in
silver
for
the
hall
it
would
do
him
a
lot
of
good
in
business
circles
and
that
reminds
me
smiled
celia
there
been
some
talk
about
a
present
from
miss
popley
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
married
decently
unless
one
life
is
ordered
on
some
sort
of
system
mine
never
has
been
and
the
result
is
that
i
make
terrible
mistakes
particularly
in
the
case
of
miss
popley
at
the
beginning
of
the
business
when
the
news
got
round
to
miss
popley
i
received
from
her
a
sweet
letter
of
congratulation
knowing
that
she
was
rather
particular
in
these
matters
i
braced
myself
up
and
thanked
her
heartily
by
return
of
post
three
days
later
when
looking
for
a
cheque
i
had
lost
i
accidentally
came
across
her
letter
help
help
i
cried
this
came
days
ago
and
i
have
answered
yet
i
sat
down
at
once
and
thanked
her
enthusiastically
another
week
passed
and
i
began
to
feel
that
i
must
really
make
an
effort
to
catch
my
correspondence
up
so
i
got
out
all
my
letters
of
congratulation
of
the
last
ten
days
and
devoted
an
afternoon
to
answering
them
i
used
much
the
same
form
of
thanks
in
all
of
them
with
the
exception
of
miss
popley
which
was
phrased
particularly
warmly
so
much
for
that
but
miss
popley
is
celia
dear
friend
also
when
i
made
out
my
list
of
guests
i
included
miss
popley
so
in
her
list
did
celia
the
result
was
that
miss
popley
received
two
invitations
to
the
wedding
sometimes
i
fear
she
must
think
we
are
pursuing
her
what
does
she
say
about
a
present
i
asked
she
wants
us
to
tell
her
what
we
want
what
we
to
say
if
we
said
an
elephant
with
a
small
card
tied
on
to
his
ear
and
wishes
from
miss
popley
on
it
it
would
look
heavenly
among
the
other
presents
you
see
what
i
mean
celia
are
we
to
suggest
something
worth
a
thousand
pounds
or
something
worth
ninepence
it
awfully
kind
of
her
but
it
makes
it
jolly
difficult
for
us
something
that
might
cost
anything
from
ninepence
to
a
thousand
pounds
suggested
celia
then
that
washes
out
the
elephant
ca
you
get
the
ninepenny
ones
now
i
suppose
i
said
reverting
to
the
subject
which
most
weighed
on
me
she
would
like
to
give
the
men
voices
for
the
choir
no
i
think
a
clock
said
celia
a
clock
can
cost
anything
you
like
or
do
like
and
perhaps
we
better
settle
now
when
it
comes
how
many
times
shall
we
write
and
thank
her
for
it
celia
considered
four
times
i
think
she
said
well
as
celia
says
it
too
late
to
draw
back
now
but
i
shall
be
glad
when
it
all
over
as
i
began
by
saying
there
too
much
arranging
and
settling
and
fixing
about
the
thing
for
me
in
the
necessary
negotiations
and
preparations
i
fear
i
have
not
shone
and
so
i
shall
be
truly
glad
when
we
have
settled
down
in
our
flat
and
celia
can
restore
my
confidence
in
myself
once
more
by
talking
loudly
to
her
domestic
staff
about
the
master
home
affairs
an
insurance
act
of
course
i
had
always
known
that
a
medical
examination
was
a
necessary
preliminary
to
insurance
but
in
my
own
case
i
had
expected
the
thing
to
be
the
merest
formality
the
doctor
having
seen
at
a
glance
what
a
fine
strong
healthy
fellow
i
was
would
look
casually
at
my
tongue
apologise
for
having
doubted
it
enquire
genially
what
my
grandfather
had
died
of
and
show
me
to
the
door
this
idea
of
mine
was
fostered
by
the
excellent
testimonial
which
i
had
written
myself
at
the
bidding
are
you
suffering
from
any
constitutional
disease
have
you
ever
had
gout
are
you
deformed
are
you
of
strictly
sober
and
temperate
habits
i
mean
my
replies
had
been
a
model
of
what
an
assurance
company
expects
then
why
the
need
of
a
doctor
however
they
insisted
the
doctor
began
quietly
enough
he
asked
as
i
had
anticipated
after
the
health
of
my
relations
i
said
that
they
were
very
fit
and
not
to
be
outdone
in
politeness
expressed
the
hope
that
people
too
were
keeping
well
in
this
trying
weather
he
wondered
if
i
drank
much
i
said
oh
well
perhaps
i
with
an
apologetic
smile
and
looked
round
for
the
sideboard
unfortunately
he
did
not
pursue
the
matter
and
now
he
said
after
the
hundredth
question
i
should
like
to
look
at
your
chest
i
had
seen
it
coming
for
some
time
in
vain
i
had
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
to
lead
him
back
to
the
subject
of
drinks
or
my
relations
it
was
no
good
he
was
evidently
determined
to
see
my
chest
nothing
could
move
him
from
his
resolve
trembling
i
prepared
for
the
encounter
what
terrible
disease
was
he
going
to
discover
he
began
by
tapping
me
briskly
all
over
in
a
series
of
double
knocks
for
the
most
part
one
at
any
point
appeared
to
satisfy
him
but
occasionally
there
would
be
no
answer
and
he
would
knock
again
at
one
spot
he
knocked
four
times
before
he
could
make
himself
heard
this
i
said
to
myself
at
the
third
knock
has
torn
it
i
shall
be
ploughed
and
i
sent
an
urgent
message
to
my
chest
for
sake
something
you
fool
ca
you
hear
the
gentleman
i
suppose
that
roused
it
for
at
the
next
knock
he
passed
on
to
an
adjacent
spot
um
he
said
when
he
had
called
everywhere
um
i
wonder
what
i
done
i
thought
to
myself
i
do
believe
he
likes
my
chest
without
a
word
he
got
out
his
stethoscope
and
began
to
listen
to
me
as
luck
would
have
it
he
struck
something
interesting
almost
at
once
and
for
what
seemed
hours
he
stood
there
listening
and
listening
to
it
but
it
was
boring
for
me
because
i
really
had
very
little
to
do
i
could
have
bitten
him
in
the
neck
with
some
ease
or
i
might
have
licked
his
ear
beyond
that
nothing
seemed
to
offer
i
moistened
my
lips
and
spoke
am
i
dying
i
asked
in
a
broken
voice
do
talk
he
said
just
breathe
naturally
i
am
dying
i
thought
and
he
is
hiding
it
from
me
it
was
a
terrible
reflection
um
he
said
and
moved
on
by
and
by
he
went
and
listened
behind
my
back
it
is
very
bad
form
to
listen
behind
a
person
back
i
did
not
tell
him
so
however
i
wanted
him
to
like
me
yes
he
said
now
cough
i
have
a
cough
i
pointed
out
make
the
noise
of
coughing
he
said
severely
extremely
nervous
i
did
my
celebrated
imitation
of
a
man
with
an
irritating
cough
h
h
h
h
yes
said
the
doctor
go
on
he
likes
it
i
said
to
myself
and
he
must
obviously
be
an
excellent
judge
i
shall
devote
more
time
to
mimicry
in
future
h
h
h
the
doctor
came
round
to
where
i
could
see
him
again
now
cough
like
this
he
said
honk
honk
i
gave
my
celebrated
imitation
of
a
sick
rhinoceros
gasping
out
its
life
it
went
well
i
got
an
encore
um
he
said
gravely
um
he
put
his
stethoscope
away
and
looked
earnestly
at
me
tell
me
the
worst
i
begged
i
not
bothering
about
this
stupid
insurance
business
now
that
off
of
course
but
how
long
have
i
i
must
put
my
affairs
in
order
can
you
promise
me
a
week
he
said
nothing
he
took
my
wrists
in
his
hands
and
pressed
them
it
was
evident
that
grief
him
and
that
he
was
taking
a
silent
farewell
of
me
i
bowed
my
head
then
determined
to
bear
my
like
a
man
i
said
firmly
so
be
it
and
drew
myself
away
from
him
however
he
would
let
me
go
come
come
i
said
to
him
you
must
not
give
way
and
i
made
an
effort
to
release
one
of
my
hands
meaning
to
pat
him
encouragingly
on
the
shoulder
he
resisted
i
realized
suddenly
that
i
had
mistaken
his
meaning
and
that
he
was
simply
feeling
my
pulses
um
he
said
um
and
continued
to
finger
my
wrists
clenching
my
teeth
and
with
the
veins
starting
out
on
my
forehead
i
worked
my
pulses
as
hard
as
i
could
ah
he
said
as
i
finished
tying
my
tie
and
he
got
up
from
the
desk
where
he
had
been
making
notes
of
my
disastrous
case
and
came
over
to
me
there
is
just
one
thing
more
sit
down
i
sat
down
now
cross
your
knees
i
crossed
my
knees
he
bent
over
me
and
gave
me
a
sharp
tap
below
the
knee
with
the
side
of
his
hand
my
chest
may
have
disappointed
him
he
may
have
disliked
my
back
possibly
i
was
a
complete
failure
with
my
pulses
but
i
knew
the
this
time
he
should
not
be
disappointed
i
was
taking
no
risks
almost
before
his
hand
reached
my
knee
my
foot
shot
out
and
took
him
fairly
under
the
chin
his
face
suddenly
disappeared
i
have
got
disease
i
said
cheerily
bachelor
relics
do
you
happen
to
want
i
said
to
henry
an
opera
hat
that
does
op
at
least
it
only
works
on
one
side
no
said
henry
to
any
one
who
buys
my
opera
hat
for
a
large
sum
i
am
giving
away
four
square
yards
of
linoleum
a
revolving
two
curtain
rods
a
pair
of
and
an
extremely
patent
no
said
henry
again
the
i
pleaded
is
unused
that
is
to
say
no
mouse
has
used
it
yet
my
has
never
been
blooded
i
do
want
it
myself
said
henry
but
i
know
a
man
who
does
henry
you
know
everybody
for
heaven
sake
introduce
me
to
your
friend
why
does
he
particularly
want
a
he
does
he
wants
anything
that
old
old
clothes
old
carpets
anything
that
old
he
buy
he
seemed
to
be
exactly
the
man
i
wanted
introduce
me
to
your
fellow
clubman
i
said
firmly
that
evening
i
wrote
to
henry
friend
bennett
dear
sir
i
wrote
if
you
would
call
upon
me
i
should
like
to
show
you
some
really
old
things
all
genuine
antiques
in
particular
i
would
call
your
attention
to
an
old
opera
hat
of
exquisite
workmanship
and
a
of
chaste
and
handsome
design
i
have
also
a
few
yards
of
queen
anne
linoleum
of
a
circular
pattern
which
i
think
will
please
you
my
james
the
first
and
louis
quatorze
are
well
known
to
connoisseurs
a
genuine
old
cork
bedroom
suite
comprising
one
will
also
be
included
in
the
sale
yours
faithfully
on
second
thoughts
i
tore
the
letter
up
and
sent
bennett
a
postcard
asking
him
to
favour
the
undersigned
with
a
call
at
prompt
and
at
prompt
he
came
i
had
expected
to
see
a
bearded
patriarch
with
a
hooked
nose
and
three
hats
on
his
head
but
bennett
turned
out
to
be
a
very
spruce
gentleman
wearing
i
was
sorry
to
see
much
better
clothes
than
the
opera
hat
i
proposed
to
sell
him
he
became
businesslike
at
once
just
tell
me
what
you
want
to
sell
he
said
whipping
out
a
and
i
make
a
note
of
it
i
take
anything
i
looked
round
my
spacious
apartment
and
wondered
what
to
begin
with
the
revolving
i
announced
i
afraid
there
very
little
sale
for
revolving
now
he
said
as
he
made
a
note
of
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
pointed
out
this
one
does
revolve
it
got
stuck
some
years
ago
he
did
seem
to
think
that
this
would
increase
the
rush
but
he
made
a
note
of
it
then
the
the
what
the
georgian
bureau
a
copy
of
an
old
escritoire
walnut
he
said
tapping
it
possibly
the
value
of
this
georgian
however
lies
not
in
the
wood
but
in
the
literary
associations
ah
my
customers
do
bother
much
about
that
but
still
whose
was
it
mine
i
said
with
dignity
placing
my
hand
in
the
breast
pocket
of
my
coat
i
have
written
many
charming
things
at
that
desk
my
to
a
my
on
asia
my
anything
else
in
this
room
said
bennett
carpet
curtains
nothing
else
i
said
coldly
we
went
into
the
bedroom
and
gazing
on
the
linoleum
my
enthusiasm
returned
to
me
the
linoleum
i
said
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
very
much
worn
said
bennett
i
called
his
attention
to
the
piece
under
the
bed
not
under
there
i
said
i
never
walk
on
that
piece
it
as
good
as
new
he
made
a
note
what
else
he
said
i
showed
him
round
the
collection
he
saw
the
louis
quatorze
the
cork
bedroom
suite
the
cæsarian
quite
bald
the
antique
with
genuine
crack
he
saw
it
all
and
then
we
went
back
into
the
other
rooms
and
found
some
more
things
for
him
yes
he
said
consulting
his
and
now
how
would
you
like
me
to
buy
these
at
a
large
price
i
said
if
you
have
brought
your
lend
you
a
pen
you
want
me
to
make
you
an
offer
otherwise
i
should
sell
them
by
auction
for
you
deducting
ten
per
cent
commission
not
by
auction
i
said
impulsively
i
could
bear
to
know
how
much
or
rather
how
little
my
georgian
bureau
fetched
it
was
there
as
i
think
i
told
you
that
i
wrote
my
to
the
round
give
me
an
inclusive
price
for
the
lot
and
never
never
let
me
know
the
details
he
named
an
inclusive
price
it
was
something
under
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
i
should
have
minded
that
if
it
had
only
been
a
little
over
ten
pounds
but
it
was
right
i
agreed
and
oh
i
was
nearly
forgetting
there
an
old
opera
hat
of
exquisite
workmanship
which
ah
now
clothes
had
much
better
be
sold
by
auction
make
a
pile
of
all
you
do
want
and
i
send
round
a
sack
for
them
i
have
an
auction
sale
every
wednesday
very
well
send
round
and
you
might
er
also
send
round
a
er
cheque
for
quite
so
well
then
good
morning
when
he
had
gone
i
went
into
my
bedroom
and
made
a
pile
of
my
opera
hat
it
did
look
very
impressive
hardly
worth
having
a
sack
specially
sent
round
for
it
to
keep
it
company
i
collected
an
assortment
of
clothes
it
pained
me
to
break
up
my
wardrobe
in
this
way
but
i
wanted
the
bidding
for
my
opera
hat
to
be
brisk
and
a
few
preliminary
suits
would
warm
the
public
up
altogether
it
was
a
goodly
pile
when
it
was
done
the
opera
hat
perched
on
the
top
half
of
it
only
at
work
i
received
from
bennett
a
cheque
a
catalogue
and
an
account
the
catalogue
was
marked
lots
somehow
i
felt
that
my
opera
hat
would
be
lot
i
turned
to
it
in
the
account
lot
six
shillings
it
did
well
i
said
perhaps
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
hoped
for
seven
and
sixpence
but
six
shillings
yes
it
was
a
good
hat
and
then
i
turned
to
the
catalogue
and
vest
and
vest
ditto
pair
of
trousers
and
opera
hat
opera
well
well
at
least
it
had
the
position
of
honour
at
the
end
my
opera
hat
was
starred
lords
temporal
we
have
eight
clocks
called
after
the
kind
people
who
gave
them
to
us
let
me
introduce
you
william
edward
muriel
enid
alphonse
percy
henrietta
and
john
a
large
family
but
how
convenient
said
celia
exactly
one
for
each
room
or
two
in
each
corner
of
the
i
do
suggest
it
i
just
throw
out
the
idea
which
is
rejected
how
shall
we
arrange
which
goes
into
which
room
let
pick
up
i
take
william
for
the
you
take
john
for
your
workroom
i
take
not
john
i
said
gently
john
is
john
overdoes
it
a
trifle
there
is
too
much
of
john
and
he
exposes
his
inside
which
is
not
quite
nice
well
whichever
you
like
come
on
let
begin
william
as
it
happened
i
particularly
wanted
william
he
has
an
absolutely
noiseless
tick
such
as
is
suitable
to
a
room
in
which
work
is
to
be
done
i
explained
this
to
celia
what
you
want
for
the
i
went
on
is
a
clock
which
ticks
ostentatiously
so
that
your
visitors
may
be
reminded
of
the
flight
of
time
edward
is
a
very
loud
breather
no
guest
could
fail
to
notice
edward
william
said
celia
firmly
william
has
a
very
delicate
interior
i
pleaded
you
could
never
attend
to
him
properly
i
have
been
thinking
of
william
ever
since
we
had
him
and
i
feel
that
i
understand
his
case
very
well
said
celia
with
sudden
generosity
edward
you
have
william
i
have
alphonse
for
the
you
have
john
for
your
bedroom
i
have
enid
for
mine
you
not
john
i
said
gently
to
be
frank
john
is
improper
well
percy
then
yes
percy
he
is
young
and
fair
he
shall
sit
on
the
chest
of
drawers
and
sing
to
my
then
henrietta
had
better
go
in
the
spare
room
and
muriel
in
jane
muriel
is
much
too
good
for
jane
i
protested
besides
a
servant
wants
an
alarm
clock
to
get
her
up
in
the
morning
you
forget
that
muriel
cuckoos
at
six
she
will
cuckoo
exactly
six
times
and
at
the
sixth
jane
brisks
out
of
bed
i
still
felt
a
little
doubtful
because
the
early
morning
is
a
bad
time
for
counting
cuckoos
and
i
did
see
why
jane
should
brisk
out
at
the
seventh
oo
by
mistake
one
day
however
jane
is
in
department
and
if
celia
was
satisfied
i
was
besides
the
only
other
place
for
muriel
was
the
bathroom
and
there
is
something
about
a
in
a
bathroom
which
well
one
wants
to
be
educated
up
to
it
and
that
said
celia
gladly
leaves
the
kitchen
for
john
john
as
i
think
i
have
said
displays
his
inside
in
a
lamentable
way
there
is
too
much
of
john
if
jane
does
mind
i
added
she
may
have
been
strictly
brought
up
she
love
him
john
lacks
reserve
but
he
is
a
good
and
so
our
eight
friends
were
settled
but
alas
not
for
long
our
discussion
had
taken
place
on
the
eve
of
jane
arrival
and
when
she
turned
up
next
day
she
brought
with
her
to
our
horror
a
clock
of
her
own
called
i
think
mother
at
any
rate
she
was
fond
of
it
and
refused
to
throw
it
away
and
it
got
an
alarm
so
it
goes
in
her
bedroom
said
celia
and
muriel
goes
into
the
kitchen
jane
loves
it
because
she
comes
from
the
country
and
the
cuckoo
reminds
her
of
home
that
still
leaves
john
eating
his
head
off
and
moreover
showing
people
what
happens
to
it
i
added
severely
i
think
i
have
already
mentioned
john
foible
well
there
only
one
thing
for
it
he
must
go
under
the
bed
i
tried
to
imagine
john
under
the
bed
suppose
i
said
we
had
a
nervous
visitor
and
she
looked
under
the
bed
before
getting
into
it
and
saw
john
it
is
a
terrible
thought
celia
however
that
is
where
he
is
it
is
a
lonely
life
for
him
but
we
shall
wind
him
up
every
week
and
he
will
think
that
he
is
being
of
service
to
us
indeed
he
probably
imagines
that
our
guests
prefer
to
sleep
under
the
bed
now
with
john
at
last
arranged
for
our
family
should
have
been
happy
but
three
days
ago
i
discovered
that
it
was
william
who
was
going
to
be
the
real
trouble
to
think
of
william
the
pride
of
the
flock
betraying
us
as
you
may
remember
william
lives
with
me
he
presides
over
the
room
we
call
the
library
to
visitors
and
the
master
room
to
jane
he
smiles
at
me
when
i
work
ordinarily
when
i
want
to
know
the
time
i
look
at
my
watch
but
the
other
morning
i
happened
to
glance
at
william
he
said
twenty
minutes
past
seven
as
i
am
never
at
work
as
early
as
that
and
as
my
watch
said
i
guessed
at
once
that
william
had
stopped
in
the
evening
having
by
that
time
found
the
key
i
went
to
wind
him
up
to
my
surprise
he
said
i
put
my
ear
to
his
chest
and
heard
his
gentle
breathing
he
was
alive
and
going
well
with
a
murmured
apology
i
set
him
to
the
right
time
and
by
the
morning
he
was
of
an
hour
fast
unlike
john
william
is
reticent
to
a
degree
with
great
difficulty
i
found
my
way
to
his
insides
and
then
found
that
he
had
practically
none
to
speak
of
at
all
certainly
he
had
no
regulator
what
shall
we
do
i
asked
celia
leave
him
and
then
when
you
bring
your
guests
in
for
a
smoke
you
can
say
do
go
yet
this
clock
is
five
hours
and
minutes
fast
or
six
hours
and
minutes
slow
i
wonder
which
would
sound
better
anyhow
he
is
much
too
beautiful
to
go
under
a
bed
so
we
are
leaving
him
and
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
beauty
i
look
at
william
mahogany
sides
and
am
soothed
into
slumber
again
and
when
i
want
to
adjust
my
watch
which
always
loses
a
little
i
creep
under
the
bed
and
consult
john
john
alone
of
all
our
family
keeps
the
correct
time
and
it
is
a
pity
that
he
alone
must
live
in
retirement
the
missing
card
what
i
say
is
this
a
man
has
his
own
work
to
do
he
slaves
at
the
office
all
day
earning
a
living
for
those
dependent
on
him
and
when
he
comes
home
he
may
reasonably
expect
not
to
be
bothered
with
domestic
business
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
and
you
would
go
on
to
say
would
you
not
that
anyhow
the
insuring
of
his
servants
might
safely
be
left
to
his
wife
of
course
you
would
thank
you
very
much
i
first
spoke
to
celia
about
the
insuring
of
the
staff
some
weeks
ago
our
staff
consists
of
jane
parsons
the
cook
the
first
parlourmaid
jane
and
parsons
the
upper
housemaid
we
call
them
collectively
jane
by
the
way
i
said
to
celia
i
suppose
jane
is
insured
all
right
i
was
going
to
see
about
it
said
celia
i
looked
at
her
in
surprise
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
might
have
said
myself
i
hope
she
wo
be
unkind
about
it
i
went
on
if
she
objects
to
paying
her
share
tell
her
i
am
related
to
a
solicitor
if
she
still
objects
er
tell
her
we
pay
it
ourselves
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
fortunately
she
has
no
head
for
figures
this
is
true
jane
is
an
excellent
cook
and
well
worth
the
a
year
or
whatever
it
is
we
pay
her
but
arithmetic
gives
her
a
headache
when
celia
has
finished
dividing
by
twelve
jane
is
in
a
state
of
complete
nervous
exhaustion
and
is
only
too
thankful
to
take
the
that
celia
hands
over
to
her
without
asking
any
questions
indeed
that
the
government
wished
deducted
from
jane
wages
we
could
deduct
with
a
minimum
of
friction
from
to
a
a
threepenny
insurance
would
be
child
play
three
weeks
later
i
said
to
celia
has
an
inspector
been
to
see
jane
card
yet
jane
card
she
asked
blankly
the
insurance
card
with
the
pretty
stamps
on
no
no
luckily
you
mean
i
was
going
to
see
about
it
said
celia
i
got
up
and
paced
the
floor
really
i
murmured
really
i
tried
the
various
chairs
in
the
room
and
finally
went
and
stood
with
my
back
to
the
in
short
i
behaved
like
a
justly
incensed
you
know
what
happens
i
said
when
i
was
calm
again
if
we
neglect
this
duty
which
parliament
has
laid
upon
us
no
we
go
to
prison
at
least
one
of
us
does
i
not
quite
sure
which
i
hope
it
you
said
celia
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
it
is
however
we
shall
know
when
the
inspector
comes
round
if
it
you
she
went
on
i
shall
send
you
in
a
file
with
which
you
can
cut
through
your
chains
and
escape
it
will
be
concealed
in
a
loaf
of
bread
so
that
your
gaolers
sha
suspect
probably
i
should
suspect
either
until
i
had
bitten
on
it
suddenly
perhaps
you
better
not
bother
it
would
be
simpler
if
you
got
card
instead
but
of
course
i
will
that
is
to
say
i
tell
jane
to
get
it
herself
it
her
cinema
evening
out
once
a
week
jane
leaves
us
and
goes
to
a
cinema
her
life
is
full
of
variety
ten
days
elapsed
and
then
one
evening
i
said
at
least
i
did
before
i
could
get
it
out
celia
interrupted
no
not
yet
you
see
there
been
a
hitch
i
curbed
my
anger
and
spoke
calmly
what
sort
of
a
hitch
well
jane
forgot
last
wednesday
and
i
forgot
to
remind
her
this
wednesday
but
wednesday
why
do
you
do
it
yourself
well
if
you
tell
me
what
to
do
i
do
it
well
er
you
just
you
i
mean
well
they
tell
you
at
the
that
exactly
how
i
keep
explaining
it
to
jane
said
celia
i
looked
at
her
mournfully
what
shall
we
do
i
asked
i
feel
quite
hopeless
about
it
it
seems
too
late
now
to
do
anything
with
jane
let
get
a
new
staff
and
begin
again
properly
lose
jane
cried
celia
i
sooner
go
to
prison
i
mean
i
sooner
went
to
prison
why
ca
you
be
a
man
and
do
something
celia
does
seem
to
realize
that
i
married
her
with
the
sole
idea
of
getting
free
of
all
this
sort
of
bother
as
it
is
i
nearly
die
once
a
year
in
the
attempt
to
fill
up
my
form
any
traffic
in
insurance
cards
would
my
doctor
says
be
absolutely
fatal
however
something
had
to
be
done
last
week
i
went
into
a
neighbouring
in
order
to
send
a
telegram
the
is
an
annexe
of
the
grocer
where
the
sardines
come
from
on
jane
cinema
evening
having
sent
the
telegram
i
took
a
sudden
desperate
resolve
i
i
myself
would
do
something
i
want
i
said
bravely
an
insurance
stamp
sixpenny
or
sevenpenny
said
the
girl
trying
to
put
me
off
my
balance
at
the
very
beginning
what
the
difference
i
asked
you
need
say
a
penny
because
that
is
obvious
however
she
had
no
wish
to
be
funny
sevenpenny
for
sixpenny
for
women
she
explained
i
was
going
to
give
away
our
domestic
arrangements
to
so
near
a
neighbour
three
sixpenny
and
four
sevenpenny
i
said
casually
flicking
the
dust
off
my
shoes
with
a
handkerchief
tut
tut
i
was
forgetting
thomas
i
added
five
sevenpenny
i
took
the
stamps
home
and
showered
them
on
celia
you
see
i
said
it
not
really
difficult
oh
you
angel
what
do
i
do
with
them
stick
them
on
jane
i
said
grandly
dot
them
about
the
house
stamp
your
letters
with
them
i
can
always
get
you
plenty
more
did
you
get
a
card
too
no
i
did
the
fact
is
it
your
turn
now
celia
get
the
card
oh
all
right
i
er
suppose
you
just
ask
for
a
a
card
i
suppose
so
and
er
choose
a
doctor
and
er
decide
on
an
approved
society
and
er
explain
why
it
is
you
had
got
a
card
before
and
er
well
anyhow
it
your
turn
now
celia
it
really
still
jane
turn
said
celia
only
she
so
stupid
about
it
but
she
turned
out
to
be
not
so
stupid
as
we
thought
for
yesterday
there
came
a
ring
at
the
bell
feeling
instinctively
that
it
was
the
inspector
celia
and
i
got
behind
the
sofa
and
emerged
some
minutes
later
to
find
jane
alone
in
the
room
somebody
come
to
see
about
an
insurance
card
or
something
she
said
i
said
you
were
both
out
and
would
he
come
technically
i
suppose
we
both
out
that
is
we
were
not
receiving
thank
you
jane
i
said
stiffly
i
turned
to
celia
there
you
are
i
said
something
be
done
i
always
said
i
do
it
said
celia
silver
linings
we
want
some
more
coal
said
celia
suddenly
at
breakfast
sorry
i
said
engrossed
in
my
paper
and
i
passed
her
the
marmalade
more
coal
she
repeated
i
pushed
across
the
toast
celia
sighed
and
held
up
her
hand
please
may
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
she
said
trying
to
snap
her
fingers
good
i
caught
his
eye
we
want
i
awfully
sorry
what
is
it
we
want
some
more
coal
never
mind
this
once
whether
inman

hobbs
or
not
just
help
me
celia
you

reading
the
paper
i
said
in
surprise
i
thought
you
only
read
the
the
serial
story
how
did
you
know
inman
was
playing
hobbs
well
poulton
or
carpentier
or

you

when
you
out
of
nutmegs
it
depends
if
the
nutmeg
porters
are
striking
striking
good
heavens
i
never
thought
about
that
i
glanced
hastily
down
the
headlines
of
my
paper
celia
this
is
serious
i
shall
have
to
think
about
this
seriously
will
you
order
a
fire
in
the
library
i
shall
retire
to
the
library
and
think
this
over
you
can
retire
to
the
library
but
you
ca
have
a
fire
there
only
just
enough
for
the
kitchen
for
two
days
then
come
and
chaperon
me
in
the
kitchen
do
leave
me
alone
with
jane
you
and
i
and
jane
will
assemble
round
the
oven
and
discuss
the
matter
it
cold
not
the
kitchen
i
assemble
with
you
round
the
electric
light
somewhere
come
on
we
went
into
the
library
and
rallied
round
a
wax
vesta
it
was
a
terribly
cold
morning
i
ca
think
like
this
i
said
after
fifteen
seconds
reflection
i
going
to
the
office
there
a
fire
there
anyway
you
would
like
a
nice
secretary
said
celia
timidly
or
an
office
girl
or
somebody
to
lick
the
stamps
i
should
never
do
any
work
if
you
came
i
said
looking
at
her
thoughtfully
do
come
no
i
shall
be
all
right
i
got
shopping
to
do
this
morning
and
going
out
to
lunch
and
i
can
pay
some
calls
afterwards
right
and
you
might
find
out
what
other
people
are
doing
the
people
you
call
on
and
er
if
you
be
left
alone
in
the
a
moment
and
the
is
at
all
adjacent
you
have
your
muff
with
you
you
see
and
well
i
leave
that
to
you
do
what
you
can
i
had
a
good
day
at
the
office
and
have
never
been
so
loth
to
leave
i
always
felt
i
should
get
to
like
my
work
some
time
i
arrived
home
again
about
six
celia
was
a
trifle
later
and
i
met
her
on
the
mat
as
she
came
in
any
luck
i
asked
eagerly
feeling
in
her
muff
dash
it
celia
there
are
nothing
but
hands
here
do
you
mean
to
say
you
did
pick
up
anything
at
all
only
information
she
said
leading
the
way
into
the
hallo
what
this
a
fire
a
small
involuntary
contribution
from
the
office
i
brought
it
home
under
my
hat
well
what
the
news
that
if
we
want
any
coal
we
shall
have
to
fetch
it
ourselves
and
we
can
get
it
in
small
amounts
from
greengrocers
why
greengrocers
i
know
i
suppose
they
have
to
have
fires
to
force
the
cabbages
but
what
about
the
striking
coal
porters
if
you
do
their
job
wo
they
picket
you
or
pickaxe
you
or
something
oh
of
course
i
should
hate
to
go
alone
but
i
shall
be
all
right
if
you
come
with
me
celia
faith
in
me
is
very
touching
i
am
not
quite
so
confident
about
myself
no
doubt
i
could
protect
her
easily
against
five
or
six
great
brawny
hulking
porters
armed
with
but
i
am
seriously
doubtful
whether
a
dozen
or
so
aided
with
a
little
luck
might
get
the
better
of
me
do
let
us
be
rash
i
said
thoughtfully
do
let
us
infuriate
them
you
are
afraid
of
a
striker
asked
celia
in
amazement
of
an
ordinary
striker
no
in
a
strike
of
or
or
or
professional
skeletons
i
should
be
a
lion
among
the
blacklegs
but
there
is
something
about
the
very
word
coal
porter
which
you
know
i
really
think
this
is
a
case
where
the
british
army
might
help
us
we
have
been
very
good
to
it
the
british
army
i
should
explain
has
been
walking
out
with
jane
lately
when
we
go
away
for
we
let
the
british
army
drop
in
to
supper
luckily
it
neither
smokes
nor
drinks
nor
takes
any
great
interest
in
books
it
is
a
great
relief
on
your
in
the
country
to
that
the
british
army
is
dropping
in
to
supper
when
otherwise
you
might
only
have
suspected
it
i
may
say
that
we
are
rather
hoping
to
get
a
position
in
the
army
recruiting
film
on
the
strength
of
this
hospitality
let
the
british
army
go
i
said
we
been
very
kind
to
him
i
fancy
jane
has
left
the
service
i
do
know
why
probably
they
quarrelled
because
she
gave
him
caviare
two
nights
running
i
said
well
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
but
it
will
be
no
place
for
women
afternoon
i
will
sally
forth
alone
to
do
it
but
i
added
i
shall
probably
return
with
two
coal
porters
clinging
round
my
neck
order
tea
for
three
next
evening
after
a
warm
and
busy
day
at
the
office
i
put
on
my
and
and
went
out
if
there
was
any
accident
i
was
determined
to
be
described
in
the
papers
as
the
body
of
a
man
to
go
down
to
history
as
the
remains
of
a
shabbily
dressed
individual
would
be
too
depressing
beautifully
clothed
i
jumped
into
a
taxi
and
drove
to
celia
greengrocer
celia
herself
was
keeping
warm
by
paying
still
more
calls
i
want
i
said
nervously
a
hundredweight
of
coal
and
a
cauliflower
this
was
my
own
idea
i
intended
to
place
the
cauliflower
on
the
top
of
a
sack
and
so
to
deceive
any
coal
porter
no
no
i
should
say
not
coal
nice
cauliflowers
for
sunday
dinner
ca
deliver
the
coal
said
the
greengrocer
i
going
to
take
it
with
me
i
explained
he
went
round
to
a
yard
at
the
back
i
motioned
my
taxi
along
and
followed
him
at
the
head
of
three
small
boys
who
had
never
seen
a
and
a
cauliflower
so
close
together
we
got
the
sack
into
position
come
come
i
said
to
the
driver
have
you
ever
seen
a
before
give
us
a
hand
with
it
or
i
shall
miss
my
train
and
be
late
for
dinner
he
grinned
and
gave
a
hand
i
paid
the
greengrocer
pressed
the
cauliflower
into
the
hand
of
the
smallest
boy
and
drove
off
it
was
absurdly
easy
there
was
no
gore
at
all
there
i
said
to
celia
when
she
came
back
and
when
that
done
get
you
some
more
hooray
and
yet
she
went
on
i
almost
sorry
you
see
i
was
working
off
my
calls
so
nicely
and
you
been
having
some
quite
busy
days
at
the
office
had
you
the
order
of
the
bath
we
must
really
do
something
about
the
bath
said
celia
we
must
i
agreed
at
present
what
we
do
is
this
punctually
at
or
nine
or
whenever
it
is
celia
goes
in
to
make
herself
clean
and
beautiful
for
the
new
day
while
i
amuse
myself
with
a
razor
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
she
gives
a
whistle
to
imply
that
the
bathroom
is
now
vacant
and
i
give
another
one
to
indicate
that
i
have
only
cut
myself
once
i
then
go
hopefully
in
and
find
that
the
bath
is
half
full
of
water
whereupon
i
go
back
to
my
room
and
engage
in
hugh
de
physical
exercises
for
the
after
these
are
over
i
take
another
look
at
the
bath
discover
that
it
is
now
full
and
return
to
my
room
and
busy
myself
with
archibald
mental
drill
for
busy
men
by
the
time
i
have
committed
three
odes
of
horace
to
memory
it
may
be
low
tide
or
it
may
not
if
not
i
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
bath
with
the
daily
paper
and
read
about
the
latest
strike
my
mind
occupied
equally
with
wondering
when
the
water
is
going
out
and
when
the
bricklayers
are
and
the
thought
that
celia
is
now
in
the
eating
more
than
her
share
of
the
toast
does
not
console
me
in
the
least
yes
i
said
it
absurd
to
go
on
like
this
you
had
better
see
about
it
celia
i
do
think
i
mean
i
think
you
know
it
really
turn
to
do
something
for
the
bathroom
what
do
you
mean
turn
did
i
buy
the
glass
shelves
for
it
you
never
even
heard
of
glass
shelves
well
who
put
them
up
after
they
been
lying
about
for
a
month
said
celia
i
did
and
who
bumped
his
head
against
them
the
next
day
i
did
yes
but
that
was
really
a
thing
to
do
it
your
turn
to
be
useful
celia
this
is
mutiny
all
household
matters
are
supposed
to
be
looked
after
by
you
i
do
the
brain
work
i
earn
the
money
i
can
not
be
bothered
with
these
little
domestic
worries
i
have
said
so
before
i
sort
of
thought
you
had
you
know
i
am
afraid
that
is
true
after
all
she
went
on
the
drinks
are
in
your
department
hock
perhaps
i
said
soapy
water
no
there
is
a
difference
not
very
much
said
celia
by
the
end
of
another
week
i
was
getting
seriously
alarmed
i
began
to
fear
that
unless
i
watched
it
very
carefully
i
should
be
improving
myself
too
much
while
the
water
was
running
out
this
morning
i
said
to
celia
as
i
started
my
breakfast
just
about
i
got
off
by
heart
and
made
five
hundred
and
revolutions
with
the
back
paws
and
then
it
was
time
to
shave
myself
again
what
a
life
for
a
busy
man
i
do
know
if
you
know
that
it
no
begin
again
i
that
it
no
good
waiting
for
the
last
inch
or
two
to
go
out
by
itself
because
it
wo
you
have
to
to
it
out
i
do
and
i
sit
on
the
taps
looking
like
a
full
moon
and
try
to
draw
it
out
but
it
no
good
we
had
a
neap
tide
and
i
had
to
hoosh
four
inches
jolly
celia
gave
a
sigh
of
resignation
all
right
she
said
i
go
to
the
plumber
not
the
plumber
i
begged
on
the
contrary
the
plumber
is
the
man
who
the
leaks
what
we
really
want
is
an
unplumber
we
fell
into
silence
again
but
how
silly
we
are
cried
celia
suddenly
of
course
what
the
matter
now
the
bath
is
the
business
write
and
tell
him
but
but
what
shall
i
say
somehow
i
knew
celia
would
put
it
on
to
me
why
just
when
you
paying
the
rent
you
know
i
i
see
i
retired
to
the
library
and
thought
it
out
i
hate
writing
business
letters
the
result
is
a
mixture
of
formality
and
chattiness
which
seems
to
me
all
wrong
my
first
letter
to
the
landlord
went
like
this
dear
sir
i
enclose
cheque
in
payment
of
last
quarter
rent
our
bath
wo
run
out
properly
yours
faithfully
it
is
difficult
to
say
just
what
is
wrong
with
that
letter
and
yet
it
is
obvious
that
something
has
happened
to
it
it
is
i
tried
again
dear
sir
enclosed
please
find
cheque
in
payment
of
enclosed
account
i
must
ask
you
either
to
enlarge
the
exit
to
our
bath
or
to
supply
an
emergency
door
at
present
my
morning
and
evening
baths
are
in
serious
danger
of
clashing
yours
faithfully
my
third
attempt
had
more
sting
in
it
dear
sir
unless
you
do
something
to
our
bath
i
can
not
send
you
enclosed
cheque
in
payment
of
enclosed
account
otherwise
i
would
have
yours
faithfully
at
this
point
i
whistled
to
celia
and
laid
the
letters
before
her
you
see
what
it
is
i
said
i
not
quite
getting
the
note
but
you
so
abrupt
she
said
you
must
remember
that
this
is
all
coming
quite
as
a
surprise
to
him
you
want
to
lead
up
to
it
more
gradually
ah
perhaps
you
right
let
try
again
i
tried
again
with
this
result
dear
sir
in
sending
you
a
cheque
in
payment
of
last
quarter
rent
i
feel
i
must
tell
you
how
comfortable
we
are
here
the
only
inconvenience
and
it
is
indeed
a
trifling
one
dear
sir
which
we
have
experienced
is
in
connection
with
the
bathroom
elegantly
appointed
and
spacious
as
this
room
is
commodious
as
we
find
the
actual
bath
itself
yet
we
feel
that
in
the
matter
of
the
the
high
standard
of
efficiency
so
discernible
elsewhere
is
sadly
lacking
were
i
alone
i
should
not
complain
but
unfortunately
there
are
two
of
us
and
for
the
second
one
the
weariness
of
waiting
while
the
waters
of
the
first
bath
exude
drop
by
drop
is
almost
more
than
can
be
borne
i
speak
with
knowledge
for
it
is
i
who
i
tore
the
letter
up
and
turned
to
celia
i
a
fool
i
said
i
just
thought
of
something
which
will
save
me
all
this
rotten
business
every
morning
i
so
glad
what
is
it
why
of
course
in
future
will
go
to
the
bath
first
and
i
do
it
is
a
ridiculously
simple
solution
and
i
can
not
think
why
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
a
trunk
call
last
wednesday
being
the
anniversary
of
the
wednesday
before
celia
gave
me
a
present
of
a
the
knocker
was
in
the
shape
of
an
elephant
head
not
and
by
bumping
the
animal
trunk
against
his
chin
you
could
produce
a
small
brass
noise
it
for
the
library
she
explained
eagerly
you
going
to
work
there
this
morning
are
you
yes
i
shall
be
very
busy
i
said
in
my
busy
voice
well
just
put
it
up
before
you
start
and
then
if
i
to
interrupt
you
for
anything
important
i
can
knock
with
it
say
you
love
it
it
a
dear
and
so
are
you
come
along
let
put
it
up
i
got
a
small
and
with
very
little
loss
of
blood
managed
to
screw
it
into
the
door
some
people
are
born
screwists
some
are
not
i
am
one
of
the
nots
it
rather
sideways
said
celia
doubtfully
osso
erry
i
said
what
i
took
my
knuckle
from
my
mouth
not
so
very
i
repeated
i
wish
it
had
been
straight
so
do
i
but
it
too
late
now
you
have
to
leave
these
things
very
largely
to
the
besides
elephants
often
do
have
their
heads
sideways
i
noticed
it
at
the
zoo
well
never
mind
i
think
it
very
clever
of
you
to
do
it
at
all
now
then
you
go
in
and
i
knock
and
see
if
you
hear
i
went
in
and
shut
the
door
celia
remaining
outside
after
five
seconds
having
heard
nothing
but
not
wishing
to
disappoint
her
i
said
come
in
in
the
voice
of
one
who
has
been
suddenly
disturbed
by
a
loud
i
have
knocked
yet
said
celia
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
why
not
i
was
admiring
him
he
jolly
do
come
and
look
at
him
again
i
went
out
and
looked
at
him
again
he
really
gave
an
air
to
the
library
door
his
face
is
rather
dirty
said
celia
i
think
he
wants
some
brass
polish
and
a
and
a
bun
she
ran
off
to
the
kitchen
i
remained
behind
with
jumbo
and
had
a
little
practice
the
knock
was
not
altogether
convincing
owing
to
the
fact
that
his
chin
was
too
receding
for
his
trunk
to
get
at
it
properly
i
could
hear
it
quite
easily
on
my
own
side
of
the
door
but
i
felt
rather
doubtful
whether
the
sound
would
penetrate
into
the
room
the
natural
noise
of
the
elephant
roar
bark
whistle
or
whatever
it
is
i
have
never
heard
but
i
am
told
it
is
very
terrible
to
denizens
of
the
jungle
jumbo
cry
would
not
have
alarmed
an
ant
celia
came
back
with
flannels
and
things
and
washed
jumbo
face
there
she
said
now
his
mother
would
love
him
again
very
confidently
she
propelled
his
trunk
against
his
chin
and
added
come
in
you
can
hear
it
quite
plainly
i
said
quickly
it
does
re
rever
reverberate
is
that
the
word
said
celia
but
it
quite
a
distinctive
noise
i
sure
you
hear
it
i
sure
i
should
let
try
not
now
i
try
later
on
when
you
are
expecting
it
besides
you
must
begin
your
work
work
hard
she
pushed
me
in
and
shut
the
door
i
began
to
work
i
work
best
on
the
sofa
i
think
most
clearly
in
what
appears
to
the
hasty
observer
to
be
an
attitude
of
rest
but
i
am
not
sure
that
celia
really
understands
this
yet
accordingly
when
a
knock
comes
at
the
door
i
jump
to
my
feet
ruffle
my
hair
and
stride
up
and
down
the
room
with
one
hand
on
my
brow
come
in
i
call
impatiently
and
celia
finds
me
absolutely
in
the
throes
if
there
should
chance
to
be
a
second
knock
later
on
i
make
a
sprint
for
the
seize
pen
and
paper
upset
the
ink
or
not
as
it
happens
and
present
to
any
one
coming
in
at
the
door
the
most
thoroughly
engrossed
back
in
london
but
that
was
in
the
good
old
days
of
on
this
particular
morning
i
had
hardly
written
more
than
a
couple
of
thousand
words
i
mean
i
had
hardly
got
the
cushions
at
the
back
of
my
head
comfortably
settled
when
celia
came
in
well
she
said
eagerly
i
struggled
out
of
the
sofa
what
is
it
i
asked
sternly
did
you
hear
it
all
right
i
did
hear
anything
oh
she
said
in
great
disappointment
but
perhaps
you
were
asleep
she
went
on
hopefully
certainly
not
i
was
working
did
i
interrupt
you
you
did
rather
but
it
does
matter
oh
well
i
wo
do
it
again
unless
i
really
have
to
and
good
luck
she
went
out
and
i
returned
to
my
sofa
after
an
hour
or
so
my
mind
began
to
get
to
work
and
i
got
up
and
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
room
the
gentle
exercise
seemed
to
stimulate
me
seeing
my
new
putter
in
the
corner
of
the
room
i
took
it
up
my
brain
full
of
other
things
and
dropping
a
golf
ball
on
the
carpet
began
to
practise
after
five
or
ten
minutes
my
ideas
being
now
quite
clear
i
was
just
about
to
substitute
the
pen
for
the
putter
when
celia
came
in
oh
she
said
are
are
you
busy
i
turned
round
from
a
difficult
putt
with
the
club
in
my
hand
very
i
said
what
is
it
i
do
want
to
disturb
you
if
you
working
i
am
but
i
just
wondered
if
you
if
you
liked
artichokes
i
looked
at
her
coldly
i
will
fill
in
your
confession
book
another
time
i
said
stiffly
and
i
sat
down
with
dignity
at
my
desk
and
dipped
the
putter
in
the
ink
it
for
dinner
said
celia
persuasively
do
say
because
i
do
want
to
eat
them
all
by
myself
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
humour
her
if
it
a
jerusalem
artichoke
you
mean
yes
i
said
the
other
sort
no
arthur
choke
i
love
sorry
for
interrupting
and
then
as
she
went
to
the
door
you
hear
jumbo
this
time
did
you
i
believe
that
the
only
reason
you
came
in
for
well
one
of
them
are
you
coming
in
again
do
know
she
smiled
depends
if
i
can
think
of
an
excuse
right
i
said
in
that
case
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
i
took
up
my
pen
and
began
to
work
but
i
have
a
suggestion
to
make
to
celia
at
present
although
jumbo
is
really
mine
is
having
all
the
fun
with
him
and
as
long
as
jumbo
is
on
the
outside
of
the
door
there
can
never
rise
an
occasion
when
i
should
want
to
use
him
my
idea
is
that
i
should
unscrew
jumbo
and
put
him
on
the
of
the
door
so
that
i
can
knock
when
i
come
out
and
then
when
celia
wants
to
come
in
she
will
warn
me
in
the
way
with
her
knuckles
and
i
shall
have
time
to
do
something
about
it
other
people
houses
the
parting
guest
when
nice
people
ask
me
to
their
houses
for
the
i
reply
that
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
but
that
pressure
of
work
will
prevent
my
staying
beyond
tuesday
sometimes
in
spite
of
this
they
try
to
kick
me
out
on
the
monday
and
if
i
find
that
they
are
serious
about
it
i
may
possibly
consent
to
go
by
an
evening
train
in
any
case
it
always
seems
to
me
a
pity
to
have
to
leave
a
house
just
as
you
are
beginning
to
know
your
way
to
the
bathroom
is
the
too
early
for
you
said
charles
on
sunday
night
of
nothing
that
i
had
said
not
if
it
in
the
evening
i
answered
it
in
the
morning
then
it
much
too
early
i
never
travel
before
breakfast
but
why
do
you
ask
well
i
got
to
ride
over
to
newtown
i
said
in
surprise
are
we
talking
about
tuesday
it
appeared
that
we
were
it
also
came
out
that
charles
and
his
wife
not
anticipating
the
pleasure
of
my
company
beyond
monday
had
arranged
to
ride
over
the
downs
to
newtown
to
inspect
a
horse
they
would
not
be
back
until
the
evening
but
that
all
right
charles
i
said
if
you
have
a
spare
horse
a
steady
one
which
does
wobble
when
it
canters
i
will
ride
with
you
there
only
the
old
pony
said
charles
and
he
will
be
wanted
to
drive
you
to
the
station
not
until
tuesday
i
pointed
out
charles
ignored
this
remark
altogether
you
could
ride
joseph
anyway
he
said
then
i
might
run
beside
you
holding
on
to
your
stirrup
my
ancestors
always
went
into
battle
like
that
we
are
still
good
runners
charles
turned
over
some
more
pages
of
his
timetable
there
is
a
he
announced
just
when
i
shall
be
getting
to
like
you
i
sighed
molly
and
i
have
to
be
off
by
ten
if
you
caught
the
you
would
want
to
leave
here
by
a
quarter
past
i
should
to
leave
i
said
reproachfully
i
should
go
with
the
greatest
regret
the
of
course
gets
you
up
to
town
much
earlier
some
such
idea
no
doubt
would
account
for
its
starting
before
the
what
have
you
at
about
if
you
do
mind
changing
at
plimton
there
a
i
got
up
and
lit
my
candle
let
wait
till
and
see
what
the
weather
like
i
said
sleepily
i
am
not
a
proud
man
but
after
what
you
said
and
if
at
all
wet
i
may
actually
be
glad
to
catch
an
early
train
and
i
marched
upstairs
to
bed
however
a
wonderful
blue
sky
next
morning
made
any
talk
of
london
utterly
offensive
my
host
and
hostess
had
finished
breakfast
by
the
time
i
got
down
and
i
was
just
beginning
my
own
when
the
sound
of
the
horses
on
the
gravel
brought
me
out
i
sorry
we
got
to
dash
off
like
this
said
charles
smiling
at
me
from
the
back
of
pompey
do
you
be
in
any
hurry
to
go
there
are
plenty
of
trains
thank
you
it
would
be
a
shame
to
leave
the
country
on
a
morning
like
this
would
it
i
shall
take
a
stroll
over
the
hills
before
lunch
and
sit
about
in
the
garden
in
the
afternoon
there
a
train
at
five
i
think
we
sha
be
back
by
then
i
afraid
so
this
will
be
i
made
my
farewells
and
pompey
who
was
rather
fresh
went
off
sideways
down
the
drive
this
left
me
alone
with
charles
charles
i
said
patting
him
with
one
hand
and
his
horse
with
the
other
do
you
bother
about
me
i
shall
be
quite
happy
by
myself
he
looked
at
me
with
a
curious
smile
and
was
apparently
about
to
say
something
when
cæsar
suddenly
caught
sight
of
my
stockings
these
though
in
reality
perfectly
tasteful
might
well
come
as
a
surprise
to
a
young
horse
and
cæsar
bolted
down
the
drive
to
tell
pompey
about
it
i
waved
to
them
all
from
the
distance
and
returned
to
my
breakfast
after
breakfast
i
lit
a
pipe
and
strolled
outside
as
i
stood
at
the
door
drinking
in
the
beauty
of
the
morning
i
was
the
victim
of
a
curious
illusion
it
seemed
to
me
that
outside
the
front
door
was
the
joseph
in
the
shafts
the
gardener
boy
holding
the
reins
and
by
the
side
of
the
boy
my
bag
we
only
just
have
time
sir
said
the
boy
but
but
i
going
by
the
five
train
i
stammered
well
sir
i
shall
be
over
at
newtown
this
afternoon
with
the
cart
i
did
not
like
to
ask
him
why
but
i
thought
i
knew
it
was
i
told
myself
to
fetch
back
the
horse
which
charles
was
going
over
to
inspect
the
horse
to
which
i
had
to
give
up
my
room
that
night
very
well
i
said
take
the
bag
now
and
leave
it
in
the
i
walk
in
later
what
the
etiquette
was
when
your
host
gave
you
a
hint
by
sending
your
bag
to
the
station
and
going
away
himself
i
did
not
know
but
however
many
bags
he
packed
and
however
many
horses
he
inspected
i
was
not
to
be
moved
till
the
five
train
half
an
hour
after
my
bag
was
gone
i
made
a
discovery
it
was
that
when
i
started
walking
to
the
five
train
i
should
have
to
start
in
pumps
my
dear
charles
i
wrote
that
night
it
was
delightful
to
see
you
this
and
i
only
wish
i
could
have
stayed
with
you
longer
but
as
you
know
i
had
to
dash
up
to
town
by
the
five
train
to
inspect
a
mule
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
a
slight
accident
happened
just
before
i
left
you
in
the
general
way
when
i
catch
an
afternoon
train
i
like
to
pack
my
bag
overnight
but
on
this
occasion
i
did
not
begin
until
nine
in
the
morning
this
only
left
me
eight
hours
and
the
result
was
that
in
my
hurry
i
packed
my
shoes
by
mistake
and
had
to
borrow
a
pair
of
yours
in
which
to
walk
to
the
station
will
bring
them
down
with
me
next
time
i
i
may
say
that
they
are
unusually
good
shoes
and
if
charles
want
me
he
must
at
least
want
them
so
i
am
expecting
another
invitation
by
every
post
when
it
arrives
i
shall
reply
that
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
but
that
alas
pressure
of
work
will
prevent
my
staying
beyond
tuesday
the
landscape
gardener
really
i
know
nothing
about
flowers
by
a
bit
of
luck
james
my
gardener
whom
i
pay
half
a
crown
a
week
for
combing
the
beds
knows
nothing
about
them
either
so
my
ignorance
remains
undiscovered
but
in
other
people
gardens
i
have
to
make
something
of
an
effort
to
keep
up
appearances
without
flattering
myself
i
may
say
that
i
have
acquired
a
certain
manner
i
give
the
impression
of
the
garden
lover
or
the
man
with
shares
in
a
seed
company
or
or
something
for
instance
at
creek
cottage
atherley
will
say
to
me
that
an
pointing
to
something
which
i
had
noticed
behind
a
rake
i
am
not
a
bit
surprised
i
say
calmly
and
a
next
to
it
i
suspected
it
i
confess
in
a
hoarse
whisper
towards
flowers
whose
names
i
know
i
adopt
a
different
tone
are
you
surprised
to
see
daffodils
out
so
early
says
atherley
with
pride
there
are
lots
out
in
london
i
mention
casually
in
the
shops
so
there
are
grapes
says
miss
atherley
i
was
not
talking
about
grapes
i
reply
stiffly
however
at
creek
cottage
just
now
i
can
afford
to
be
natural
for
it
is
not
gardening
which
comes
under
discussion
these
days
but
and
any
one
can
be
an
authority
on
that
the
atherleys
fired
by
my
tales
of
sandringham
chatsworth
arundel
and
other
places
where
i
am
constantly
spending
the
are
readjusting
their
field
in
future
it
will
not
be
called
the
garden
but
the
grounds
i
was
privileged
to
be
shown
over
the
grounds
on
my
last
visit
to
creek
cottage
here
said
atherley
we
are
having
a
plantation
it
will
keep
the
wind
off
and
we
shall
often
sit
here
in
the
early
days
of
summer
that
a
weeping
ash
in
the
middle
there
another
one
over
there
they
be
lovely
you
know
what
that
i
asked
pointing
to
a
bit
of
black
stick
on
the
left
which
even
more
than
the
other
trees
gave
the
impression
of
having
been
left
there
by
the
gardener
while
he
went
for
his
lunch
that
a
weeping
willow
this
is
rather
a
tearful
corner
of
the
grounds
apologized
miss
atherley
we
show
you
something
brighter
directly
look
there
that
the
oak
in
which
king
charles
lay
hid
at
least
it
will
be
when
it
grown
a
bit
let
go
on
to
the
shrubbery
said
atherley
we
are
having
a
new
grass
path
from
here
to
the
shrubbery
it
going
to
be
called
walk
miss
atherley
has
a
small
brother
called
henry
also
there
were
eight
kings
of
england
called
henry
many
a
time
and
oft
one
of
those
nine
henrys
has
paced
up
and
down
this
grassy
walk
his
head
bent
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
while
behind
his
furrowed
brow
who
shall
say
what
were
hatching
is
it
the
thought
of
wolsey
which
makes
him
frown
or
is
he
wondering
where
he
left
his
catapult
ah
who
can
tell
us
let
us
leave
a
veil
of
mystery
over
it
for
the
sake
of
the
next
visitor
the
shrubbery
said
atherley
proudly
waving
her
hand
at
a
couple
of
laurel
bushes
and
a
i
forgotten
its
name
now
but
it
is
one
of
the
few
shrubs
i
really
know
and
if
you
a
gentleman
said
miss
atherley
and
want
to
get
asked
here
again
you
always
it
the
shrubbery
really
i
do
see
what
else
you
could
call
it
i
said
wishing
to
be
asked
down
again
the
patch
true
i
said
i
mean
nonsense
i
was
rather
late
for
breakfast
next
morning
a
pity
on
such
a
lovely
spring
day
i
so
sorry
i
began
but
i
was
looking
at
the
shrubbery
from
my
window
and
i
quite
forgot
the
time
good
said
miss
atherley
i
must
thank
you
for
putting
me
in
such
a
perfect
room
for
it
i
went
on
warming
to
my
subject
one
can
actually
see
the
shrubs
er
shrubbing
the
plantation
too
seems
a
little
thicker
to
me
than
yesterday
i
expect
it
is
in
fact
the
tennis
lawn
i
looked
round
anxiously
i
had
a
sudden
fear
that
it
might
be
the
new
it
still
is
the
tennis
lawn
i
asked
yes
why
what
about
it
i
was
only
going
to
say
the
tennis
lawn
had
quite
a
lot
of
shadows
on
it
oh
there
no
doubt
that
the
plantation
is
really
asserting
itself
eleven
found
me
strolling
in
the
grounds
with
miss
atherley
you
know
i
said
as
we
paced
henry
walk
together
the
one
thing
the
plantation
wants
is
for
a
bird
to
nest
in
it
that
is
the
of
a
plantation
it
mother
birthday
would
it
be
a
lovely
surprise
for
her
it
would
indeed
unfortunately
this
is
a
matter
in
which
you
require
the
of
a
feathered
friend
could
you
try
to
persuade
a
bird
to
build
a
nest
in
the
weeping
ash
just
for
this
once
you
asking
me
a
very
difficult
thing
i
said
doubtfully
anything
else
i
would
do
cheerfully
for
you
but
to
dictate
to
a
bird
on
such
a
very
domestic
affair
no
i
afraid
i
must
refuse
it
need
only
just
to
build
one
pleaded
miss
atherley
because
mother
going
up
to
town
by
your
train
as
soon
as
she
out
of
the
house
the
bird
can
go
back
anywhere
else
it
likes
better
i
will
put
that
to
any
bird
i
see
i
said
but
i
am
doubtful
oh
well
sighed
miss
atherley
never
mind
what
do
you
think
cried
atherley
as
she
came
in
to
breakfast
next
day
there
a
bird
been
nesting
in
the
plantation
miss
atherley
looked
at
me
in
undisguised
admiration
i
looked
quite
surprised
i
know
i
did
well
well
i
said
you
must
come
out
afterwards
and
see
the
nest
and
tell
me
what
bird
it
is
there
are
three
eggs
in
it
i
am
afraid
i
do
know
much
about
these
things
i
glad
i
said
thankfully
i
mean
i
shall
be
glad
to
we
went
out
eagerly
after
breakfast
on
about
the
only
tree
in
the
plantation
with
a
fork
to
it
a
nest
balanced
precariously
it
had
in
it
three
eggs
splotched
with
light
brown
it
appeared
to
be
a
blackbird
nest
with
another
egg
or
two
to
come
it
been
very
quick
about
it
said
miss
atherley
of
our
feathered
bipeds
i
said
frowning
at
her
the
blackbird
is
notoriously
the
most
hasty
is
it
lovely
said
atherley
she
was
still
talking
about
it
as
she
climbed
into
the
trap
which
was
to
take
us
to
the
station
one
moment
i
said
i
forgotten
something
i
dashed
into
the
house
and
out
by
a
side
door
and
then
sprinted
for
the
plantation
i
took
the
nest
from
the
weeping
and
ash
and
put
it
carefully
back
in
the
hedge
by
the
then
i
returned
more
leisurely
to
the
house
if
you
ever
want
a
job
of
thoroughly
well
done
you
can
always
rely
upon
me
the
same
old
story
we
stood
in
a
circle
round
the
parrot
cage
and
gazed
with
interest
at
its
occupant
she
evangeline
was
balancing
easily
on
one
leg
while
with
the
other
leg
and
her
beak
she
tried
to
peel
a
there
are
some
of
us
who
hate
to
be
watched
at
meals
particularly
when
dealing
with
the
dessert
but
evangeline
is
not
of
our
number
there
said
atherley
is
she
a
beauty
i
felt
that
as
the
last
to
be
introduced
i
ought
to
say
something
what
do
you
say
to
a
parrot
i
whispered
to
miss
atherley
have
a
banana
suggested
reggie
i
believe
you
say
said
miss
atherley
but
i
know
why
is
that
rather
dangerous
suppose
it
retorted
your
own
i
should
know
a
bit
how
to
go
on
it
ca
talk
said
reggie
it
quite
a
baby
only
seven
months
old
but
it
no
good
showing
it
your
watch
you
must
think
of
some
other
way
of
amusing
it
break
it
to
me
reggie
have
i
been
asked
down
solely
to
amuse
the
parrot
or
did
any
of
you
others
want
to
see
me
only
the
parrot
said
reggie
evangeline
paid
no
attention
to
us
she
continued
to
wrestle
with
the
i
should
say
that
she
was
a
bird
not
easily
amused
ca
it
really
talk
at
all
i
asked
atherley
not
yet
you
see
she
only
just
come
over
from
south
america
and
is
used
to
the
climate
yet
but
that
just
the
person
you
expect
to
talk
a
lot
about
the
weather
i
believe
you
been
had
write
a
little
note
to
the
poulterers
and
ask
if
you
can
change
it
you
got
a
bad
one
by
mistake
we
got
it
as
a
bird
said
atherley
with
dignity
not
as
a
gramophone
the
next
morning
evangeline
was
as
silent
as
ever
miss
atherley
and
i
surveyed
it
after
breakfast
it
was
still
grappling
with
a
but
no
doubt
a
different
one
is
it
going
to
talk
i
asked
really
i
thought
parrots
were
continually
chatting
yes
but
they
have
to
be
taught
just
like
you
teach
a
baby
are
you
sure
i
quite
see
that
you
have
to
teach
them
any
special
things
you
want
them
to
say
but
i
thought
they
were
all
born
with
a
few
simple
obvious
remarks
like
polly
or
or
lloyd
george
i
do
think
so
said
miss
atherley
not
the
green
ones
at
dinner
that
evening
atherley
being
now
with
us
the
question
of
evangeline
education
was
seriously
considered
the
only
proper
method
began
atherley
by
the
way
he
said
turning
to
me
you
do
know
anything
about
parrots
do
you
no
i
said
you
can
go
on
quite
safely
the
only
proper
method
of
teaching
a
parrot
i
got
this
from
a
man
in
the
city
this
morning
is
to
give
her
a
word
at
a
time
and
to
go
on
repeating
it
over
and
over
again
until
she
got
hold
of
it
and
after
that
the
parrot
goes
on
repeating
it
over
and
over
again
until
you
got
sick
of
it
said
reggie
then
we
shall
have
to
be
very
careful
what
word
we
choose
said
atherley
what
is
your
favourite
word
well
really
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
asked
archie
this
is
quite
impossible
every
word
by
itself
seems
so
silly
not
and
i
said
reproachfully
you
shall
recite
your
little
piece
in
the
afterwards
said
miss
atherley
to
me
think
of
something
sensible
now
yes
said
atherley
what
the
latest
word
from
london
kikuyu
what
i
ca
say
it
again
i
protested
if
you
ca
even
say
it
twice
it
no
good
for
evangeline
a
thoughtful
silence
fell
upon
us
have
you
fixed
on
a
name
for
her
yet
miss
atherley
asked
her
mother
evangeline
of
course
no
i
mean
a
name
for
her
to
call
because
if
she
going
to
call
you
or
or
whatever
you
decide
on
you
better
start
by
teaching
her
that
and
then
i
had
a
brilliant
idea
i
got
the
very
word
i
said
it
you
see
it
a
pleasant
form
of
greeting
to
any
stranger
and
it
will
go
perfectly
with
the
next
word
that
she
taught
whatever
it
may
be
supposing
it
suggested
reggie
or
why
not
sardine
is
the
perfect
title
for
a
witty
subtle
neat
probably
the
great
brain
of
the
revue
king
has
already
evolved
it
and
is
planning
the
opening
scene
yes
is
at
all
bad
said
atherley
anyway
it
better
than
polly
which
is
simply
morbid
let
fix
on
good
said
atherley
evangeline
said
nothing
being
asleep
under
her
blanket
i
was
down
first
next
morning
having
forgotten
to
wind
up
my
watch
overnight
longing
for
company
i
took
the
blanket
off
evangeline
cage
and
introduced
her
to
the
world
again
she
stirred
sleepily
opened
her
eyes
and
blinked
at
me
hallo
evangeline
i
said
she
made
no
reply
suddenly
a
splendid
scheme
occurred
to
me
i
would
teach
evangeline
her
word
now
how
it
would
surprise
the
others
when
they
came
down
and
said
hallo
to
her
to
find
themselves
promptly
answered
back
evangeline
i
said
listen
hallo
hallo
hallo
hallo
i
stopped
a
moment
and
went
on
more
slowly
hallo
hallo
hallo
it
was
dull
work
hallo
i
said
hallo
hallo
hallo
and
then
very
distinctly
evangeline
looked
at
me
with
an
utterly
bored
face
hallo
i
said
hallo
hallo
she
picked
up
a
and
ate
it
languidly
hallo
i
went
on
hallo
hallo
hallo
hallo
hallo
hallo
hallo
she
dropped
her
nut
and
roused
herself
for
a
moment
number
engaged
she
snapped
and
took
another
nut
you
need
believe
this
the
others
did
when
i
told
them
the
spreading
walnut
tree
we
were
having
breakfast
in
the
garden
with
the
wasps
and
peter
was
enlarging
on
the
beauties
of
the
country
round
his
new
cottage
then
there
hilderton
he
said
that
a
lovely
little
village
told
we
might
explore
it
celia
woke
up
suddenly
is
hilderton
near
here
she
asked
in
surprise
but
i
often
stayed
there
when
i
was
a
child
this
was
years
ago
when
edward
the
seventh
was
on
the
throne
i
explained
to
peter
my
grandfather
went
on
celia
lived
at
hilderton
hall
there
was
an
impressive
silence
you
see
the
sort
of
people
you
entertaining
i
said
airily
to
peter
my
wife
grandfather
lived
at
hilderton
hall
celia
you
should
have
spoken
about
this
before
it
would
have
done
us
a
lot
of
good
in
society
i
pushed
my
plate
away
i
ca
go
on
eating
bacon
after
this
bring
me
peaches
i
should
love
to
see
it
again
if
i
had
my
rights
i
said
i
should
be
living
there
now
i
must
put
my
solicitor
on
to
this
there
been
foul
play
somewhere
peter
looked
up
from
one
of
the
maps
which
being
new
to
the
country
he
carries
with
him
i
ca
find
hilderton
hall
here
he
said
it
six
inches
to
the
mile
so
it
ought
to
be
marked
celia
our
grandfather
name
is
being
aspersed
let
us
look
into
this
we
crowded
round
the
map
and
studied
it
anxiously
hilderton
was
there
and
hilderton
house
but
no
hilderton
hall
but
it
a
great
big
place
protested
celia
i
see
what
it
is
i
said
regretfully
celia
you
were
young
then
ten
ten
and
naturally
it
seemed
big
to
you
just
as
yarrow
seemed
big
to
wordsworth
and
a
shilling
seems
a
lot
to
a
baby
but
really
really
said
peter
it
was
and
your
side
was
called
hilderton
hall
and
the
other
side
hilderton
castle
i
do
believe
it
was
even
called
hilderton
hall
said
peter
it
was
hilderton
villa
i
do
believe
she
ever
had
a
grandfather
at
all
said
peter
she
must
have
had
a
grandfather
i
pointed
out
but
i
afraid
he
never
lived
at
hilderton
hall
this
is
a
great
blow
to
me
and
i
shall
now
resume
my
bacon
i
drew
my
plate
back
and
peter
returned
his
map
to
his
pocket
you
all
very
funny
said
celia
but
i
know
it
was
hilderton
hall
i
a
good
mind
to
take
you
there
this
morning
and
show
it
to
you
do
said
peter
and
i
eagerly
it
a
great
big
place
that
what
we
coming
to
see
i
reminded
her
of
course
they
may
have
sold
some
of
the
land
or
i
mean
i
know
when
i
used
to
stay
there
it
was
a
a
great
big
place
i
ca
promise
that
it
it
no
good
now
celia
i
said
sternly
you
should
have
boasted
hilderton
was
four
miles
off
and
we
began
to
approach
it
celia
palpably
nervous
at
about
twelve
that
morning
are
you
recognizing
any
of
this
asked
peter
you
see
i
was
only
about
eight
you
recognise
the
church
i
said
pointing
to
it
if
you
do
it
proves
either
that
you
never
lived
at
hilderton
or
that
you
never
sang
in
the
choir
i
do
know
which
thought
is
the
more
distressing
now
what
about
this
place
is
this
it
celia
peered
up
the
drive
at
least
i
do
remember
it
i
know
there
was
a
walnut
tree
in
front
of
the
house
is
that
all
you
remember
well
i
was
only
about
six
peter
and
i
both
had
a
slight
cough
at
the
same
time
it
nothing
said
peter
finding
celia
indignant
eye
upon
him
let
go
on
we
found
two
more
big
houses
but
celia
a
little
doubtfully
rejected
them
both
my
was
very
hard
to
please
i
apologized
to
peter
he
passed
over
place
after
place
before
he
finally
fixed
on
hilderton
hall
either
the
heronry
was
ventilated
properly
or
the
decoy
ponds
had
the
wrong
kind
of
mud
or
there
was
a
sudden
cry
from
celia
this
is
it
she
said
she
stood
at
the
entrance
to
a
long
drive
a
few
chimneys
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
on
either
side
of
the
gates
was
a
high
wall
i
do
see
the
walnut
tree
i
said
of
course
not
because
you
ca
see
the
front
of
the
house
but
i
feel
certain
that
this
is
the
place
we
want
more
proof
than
that
said
peter
we
must
go
in
and
find
the
walnut
tree
we
ca
all
wander
into
another
man
grounds
looking
for
walnut
trees
i
said
with
no
better
excuse
than
that
was
once
asked
down
here
for
the
and
stayed
for
a
fortnight
we
my
said
celia
coldly
here
well
whatever
it
was
i
said
we
must
invent
a
proper
reason
peter
you
might
pretend
you
come
to
inspect
the
or
the
milk
or
something
or
perhaps
celia
had
better
disguise
herself
as
a
suffragette
and
say
that
she
come
to
borrow
a
box
of
matches
anyhow
one
of
us
must
get
to
the
front
of
the
house
to
search
for
this
walnut
tree
it
it
seems
rather
cheek
said
celia
doubtfully
we
toss
up
who
goes
we
tossed
and
of
course
i
lost
i
went
up
the
drive
nervously
at
the
first
turn
i
decided
to
be
an
insurance
inspector
at
the
next
a
but
as
i
approached
the
front
door
i
thought
of
a
very
simple
excuse
i
rang
the
bell
under
the
eyes
of
several
people
at
lunch
and
looked
about
eagerly
for
the
walnut
tree
there
was
none
does
er
erasmus
er
percival
live
here
i
asked
the
footman
no
sir
he
said
luckily
ah
was
there
ever
a
walnut
i
mean
there
ever
a
percival
who
lived
here
ah
thank
you
and
i
sped
down
the
drive
again
well
said
celia
eagerly
percival
live
there
whoever
mr
percival
oh
i
forgot
you
do
know
him
friends
i
added
solemnly
i
regret
to
tell
you
there
is
walnut
tree
i
am
not
surprised
said
peter
the
walk
home
was
a
silent
one
for
the
rest
of
the
day
celia
was
thoughtful
but
at
the
end
of
dinner
she
brightened
up
a
little
and
joined
in
the
conversation
at
hilderton
hall
she
said
suddenly
we
always
i
said
clearing
my
throat
loudly
peter
pass
celia
the
walnuts
i
have
had
great
fun
in
london
this
week
with
the
walnut
joke
though
celia
says
she
is
getting
tired
of
it
but
i
had
a
letter
from
peter
which
ended
like
this
by
the
way
i
was
an
ass
last
week
i
took
you
to
banfield
in
mistake
for
hilderton
i
went
to
hilderton
yesterday
and
found
hilderton
hall
a
large
place
a
walnut
tree
it
a
little
way
out
of
the
village
and
is
marked
big
on
the
next
section
of
the
map
to
the
one
we
were
looking
at
you
might
tell
celia
true
i
might
perhaps
in
a
week
or
two
i
shall
definitions
as
soon
as
we
had
joined
the
ladies
after
dinner
gerald
took
up
a
position
in
front
of
the
fire
now
that
the
long
winter
evenings
are
upon
us
he
began
anyhow
it
always
dark
at
nine
said
norah
not
in
the
morning
said
dennis
who
has
to
be
excused
for
anything
foolish
he
says
since
he
became
obsessed
with
golf
please
do
interrupt
i
begged
gerald
is
making
a
speech
i
was
only
going
to
say
that
we
might
have
a
little
game
of
some
sort
norah
what
the
latest
parlour
game
from
london
tell
your
uncle
i
urged
how
you
amuse
yourselves
at
the
lyceum
do
you
know
the
pencil
no
what
do
you
do
you
collect
five
pencils
when
you
got
them
i
tell
you
another
game
bother
these
pencil
games
said
dennis
taking
an
imaginary
swing
with
a
i
hope
it
is
too
brainy
you
want
to
know
how
to
spell
said
norah
severely
and
she
went
to
the
for
some
paper
in
a
little
while
say
half
an
hour
we
had
each
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
norah
was
ready
to
explain
it
called
definitions
i
expect
you
all
know
it
we
assured
her
we
did
well
you
begin
by
writing
down
five
or
six
letters
one
underneath
the
other
we
might
each
suggest
one
we
weighed
in
with
ours
and
the
result
was
e
p
a
d
u
now
you
write
them
backwards
there
was
a
moment
consternation
like
said
dennis
an
backwards
looks
so
silly
stupid
like
this
explained
norah
she
showed
us
her
paper
e
u
p
d
a
a
d
p
u
e
this
is
thrilling
said
gerald
pencilling
hard
then
everybody
has
to
fill
in
words
all
the
way
down
your
first
word
beginning
with
and
ending
with
and
so
on
see
gerald
leant
over
dennis
and
explained
carefully
to
him
and
in
a
little
while
we
all
saw
then
when
everybody
finished
we
define
our
words
in
turn
and
the
person
who
guesses
a
word
first
gets
a
mark
that
all
and
a
very
good
game
too
i
said
and
i
rubbed
my
head
and
began
to
think
of
course
said
norah
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
silence
you
want
to
make
the
words
difficult
and
define
them
as
subtly
as
possible
of
course
i
said
wrestling
with
u
i
could
only
think
of
one
word
and
it
was
the
one
everybody
else
was
certain
to
have
are
we
all
ready
then
somebody
begin
you
better
begin
norah
as
you
know
the
game
said
gerald
we
prepared
to
begin
mine
said
norah
is
a
bird
emu
we
all
shouted
but
i
swear
i
was
first
yes
i
do
think
that
a
very
subtle
definition
said
dennis
you
promised
to
be
as
subtle
as
possible
go
on
dear
said
gerald
to
his
wife
well
this
is
rather
awkward
mine
is
emu
i
suggested
you
must
wait
till
she
has
defined
it
said
norah
sternly
mine
is
a
sort
of
feathered
animal
emu
i
said
again
in
fact
we
all
said
it
gerald
coughed
mine
he
said
is
exactly
a
fish
because
it
emu
said
everybody
that
was
subtler
said
dennis
but
it
did
deceive
us
your
turn
said
norah
to
me
and
they
all
leant
forward
ready
to
say
emu
mine
i
said
is
all
right
dennis
you
need
look
so
excited
is
a
word
i
once
heard
a
man
say
at
the
zoo
there
was
a
shriek
of
emu
wrong
i
said
everybody
was
silent
where
did
he
say
it
asked
norah
at
last
what
was
he
doing
he
was
standing
outside
the
emu
cage
it
must
have
been
emu
it
was
perhaps
there
another
animal
beginning
with
and
ending
with
suggested
dennis
he
might
have
said
here
i
tired
of
this
old
emu
let
go
and
see
the
or
whatever
it
called
we
shall
have
to
give
it
up
said
norah
at
last
what
is
it
ebu
i
announced
my
man
had
a
bad
cold
and
he
said
baria
there
ad
ebu
er
what
do
i
get
for
that
nothing
said
norah
coldly
it
is
fair
now
mr
dennis
mine
is
emu
and
it
could
be
mistaken
for
emu
not
even
if
you
had
a
sore
throat
and
a
sprained
ankle
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
zoo
and
well
what
is
it
it
what
you
say
at
golf
when
you
miss
a
short
putt
i
doubt
it
i
said
not
what
gerald
says
said
his
wife
well
it
what
you
might
say
what
horace
would
have
said
good
said
gerald
while
his
wife
was
asking
horace
who
we
moved
on
to
the
next
word
p
mine
said
norah
is
what
you
might
do
to
a
man
whom
you
did
like
but
it
a
delightful
thing
to
have
and
at
the
same
time
you
would
hate
to
be
in
it
are
you
sure
you
know
what
you
are
talking
about
dear
said
gerald
gently
quite
said
norah
with
the
confidence
of
extreme
youth
could
you
say
it
again
very
slowly
asked
dennis
indicating
by
changes
in
the
voice
which
character
is
speaking
she
said
it
again
said
gerald
good
one
to
me
gerald
had
pod
gerald
had
pond
but
they
did
define
them
very
cleverly
and
they
were
soon
guessed
mine
unfortunately
was
also
guessed
at
once
it
is
what
dennis
golf
is
i
said
said
gerald
correctly
mine
said
dennis
is
what
everybody
has
two
of
then
it
not
i
said
because
i
only
got
one
and
ninepence
at
least
it
best
to
have
two
sometimes
you
lose
one
they
very
useful
at
golf
in
fact
absolutely
necessary
have
you
got
two
yes
i
looked
at
dennis
enormous
hands
spread
out
on
his
knees
is
it
i
asked
it
is
are
those
the
two
good
heavens
and
i
gave
myself
a
mark
a
a
was
the
next
and
we
had
the
old
emu
trouble
mine
said
norah
mine
is
rather
a
meaningless
word
shouted
everybody
mine
said
miss
gerald
is
a
very
strange
word
which
shouted
everybody
mine
said
gerald
is
a
word
which
used
to
be
shouted
everybody
mine
i
said
to
save
trouble
is
mine
said
dennis
is
it
what
you
say
at
golf
when
oh
lor
i
groaned
not
again
when
you
hole
a
long
putt
for
a
half
you
generally
say
about
for
a
good
putt
old
thing
thirty
yards
at
least
suggested
gerald
no
is
it
is
it
suggested
gerald
timidly
yes
dennis
i
said
you
an
ass
and
now
said
norah
at
the
end
of
the
game
who
won
they
counted
up
their
marks
ten
said
norah
fifteen
said
gerald
three
said
his
wife
fourteen
said
dennis
they
looked
at
me
i
afraid
i
forgot
to
put
all
mine
down
i
said
but
i
can
easily
work
it
out
there
were
five
words
and
five
definitions
of
each
word
marks
to
be
gained
altogether
you
four
have
got
er
see
between
you
that
leaves
me
that
leaves
you
seventeen
said
dennis
i
afraid
lost
old
man
he
took
up
the
shovel
and
practised
a
few
approach
shots
it
rather
a
good
game
i
think
so
too
it
a
good
game
but
like
all
paper
games
its
scoring
wants
watching
a
billiard
lesson
i
was
showing
celia
a
few
fancy
strokes
on
the
the
other
members
of
the
were
in
the
library
learning
their
parts
for
some
approaching
theatricals
that
is
to
say
they
were
sitting
round
the
fire
and
saying
to
each
other
this
a
rotten
play
we
had
been
offered
the
position
of
auditors
to
several
of
the
company
but
we
were
going
to
see
on
the
next
day
and
i
was
afraid
that
the
constant
excitement
would
be
bad
for
celia
why
do
you
ask
me
to
play
with
you
she
asked
you
never
teach
me
anything
there
ingratitude
why
i
gave
you
your
first
lesson
at
golf
only
last
thursday
so
you
did
i
know
golf
now
show
me
billiards
i
looked
at
my
watch
we
only
twenty
minutes
i
play
you
thirty
up
what
do
you
give
me
a
ball
or
a
bisque
or
what
i
ca
spare
you
a
ball
i
afraid
i
shall
want
all
three
when
i
get
going
you
may
have
fifteen
start
and
i
tell
you
what
to
do
well
what
do
i
do
first
select
a
cue
she
went
over
to
the
rack
and
inspected
them
this
seems
a
nice
brown
one
now
then
you
begin
celia
you
got
the
put
it
back
and
take
a
younger
one
i
thought
it
seemed
taller
than
the
others
she
took
another
this
good
then
off
you
go
will
you
be
spot
or
plain
i
said
chalking
my
cue
does
it
matter
not
very
much
they
both
the
same
shape
then
what
the
difference
well
one
is
more
spotted
than
the
other
then
i
be
less
spotted
i
went
to
the
table
i
think
i
said
i
try
and
screw
in
off
the
red
i
did
this
once
by
accident
and
i
always
wanted
to
do
it
again
or
perhaps
i
corrected
myself
as
soon
as
the
ball
had
left
me
i
had
better
give
a
safety
miss
i
did
my
ball
avoided
the
red
and
came
swiftly
back
into
the
bottom
pocket
that
three
to
you
i
said
without
enthusiasm
celia
seemed
surprised
but
i
have
begun
yet
she
said
well
i
suppose
you
know
the
rules
but
it
seems
funny
what
would
you
like
me
to
do
well
there
is
much
on
you
better
just
try
and
hit
the
red
ball
right
she
leant
over
the
table
and
took
long
and
careful
aim
i
held
my
breath
still
she
aimed
then
keeping
her
chin
on
the
cue
she
slowly
turned
her
head
and
looked
up
at
me
with
a
thoughtful
expression
ought
there
to
be
three
balls
on
the
table
she
said
wrinkling
her
forehead
no
i
answered
shortly
but
why
not
because
i
went
down
by
mistake
but
you
said
that
when
you
got
going
you
wanted
i
ca
argue
bending
down
like
this
she
raised
herself
slowly
you
said
oh
all
right
i
expect
you
know
anyhow
i
scored
some
already
have
i
yes
you
eighteen
to
my
nothing
yes
well
now
i
shall
have
to
aim
all
over
again
she
bent
slowly
over
her
cue
does
it
matter
where
i
hit
the
red
not
much
as
long
as
you
hit
it
on
the
red
part
she
hit
it
hard
on
the
side
and
both
balls
came
into
baulk
too
good
i
said
does
either
of
us
get
anything
for
it
no
the
red
and
the
white
were
close
together
and
i
went
up
the
table
and
down
again
on
the
of
a
cannon
i
misjudged
it
however
that
three
to
you
i
said
stiffly
as
i
took
my
ball
out
of
the
bottom
pocket
to
nothing
funny
how
i
doing
all
the
scoring
said
celia
meditatively
and
i
practically
never
played
before
i
shall
hit
the
red
hard
now
and
see
what
happens
to
it
she
hit
and
the
red
coursed
madly
about
the
table
coming
to
rest
near
the
top
pocket
and
close
to
the
cushion
with
a
forcing
shot
i
could
get
in
this
will
want
a
lot
of
chalk
i
said
pleasantly
to
celia
and
gave
it
plenty
then
i
let
fly
why
did
that
want
a
lot
of
chalk
said
celia
with
interest
i
went
to
the
and
picked
my
ball
out
of
the
fender
that
three
to
you
i
said
coldly
to
nothing
am
i
winning
you
leading
i
explained
only
you
see
i
may
make
a
twenty
at
any
moment
oh
she
thought
this
over
well
i
may
make
my
three
at
any
moment
she
chalked
her
cue
and
went
over
to
her
ball
what
shall
i
do
just
touch
the
red
on
the
side
i
said
and
you
go
into
the
pocket
the
side
do
you
mean
side
or
the
ball
the
side
of
the
ball
of
course
that
is
to
say
the
side
opposite
your
right
hand
but
its
side
is
opposite
my
hand
if
the
ball
is
facing
this
way
take
it
i
said
wearily
that
the
ball
has
its
back
to
you
how
rude
of
it
said
celia
and
hit
it
on
the
side
and
sank
it
was
that
what
you
meant
well
it
another
way
of
doing
it
i
thought
it
was
what
do
i
give
you
for
that
get
three
oh
i
thought
the
other
person
always
got
the
marks
i
know
the
last
three
times
go
on
i
said
freezingly
you
have
another
turn
oh
is
it
like
rounders
something
go
on
there
a
dear
it
getting
late
she
went
and
left
the
red
over
the
middle
pocket
i
said
i
found
a
nice
place
in
the
d
for
my
ball
now
then
this
is
the
gray
stroke
you
know
i
suppose
i
was
nervous
anyhow
i
just
nicked
the
red
ball
gently
on
the
wrong
side
and
left
it
hanging
over
the
pocket
the
white
travelled
slowly
up
the
table
why
is
that
called
the
grey
stroke
asked
celia
with
great
interest
because
once
when
sir
edward
grey
was
playing
the
german
ambassador
but
it
rather
a
long
story
i
tell
you
another
time
oh
well
anyhow
did
the
german
ambassador
get
anything
for
it
no
then
i
suppose
i
do
bother
but
you
only
got
to
knock
the
red
in
for
game
oh
there
what
that
that
a
i
get
one
oh
oh
well
she
added
magnanimously
i
glad
you
started
scoring
it
will
make
it
more
interesting
for
you
there
was
just
room
to
creep
in
off
the
red
leaving
it
still
over
the
pocket
with
celia
ball
nicely
over
the
other
pocket
there
was
a
chance
of
my
twenty
break
let
see
i
said
how
many
do
i
want
replied
celia
ah
i
said
and
i
crept
in
that

you

primrose
farm
primrose
farm
stood
slumbering
in
the
sunlight
of
an
early
summer
morn
save
for
the
gentle
breeze
which
played
in
the
tops
of
the
two
tall
elms
all
nature
seemed
at
rest
chanticleer
had
ceased
his
song
the
pigs
were
asleep
in
the
barn
the
cow
lay
thinking
a
deep
peace
brooded
over
the
rural
scene
the
peace
of
centuries
terrible
to
think
that
in
a
few
short
hours
but
perhaps
it
wo
the
truth
is
i
have
not
quite
decided
whether
to
have
the
murder
in
this
story
or
in
no
severed
we
shall
see
as
her
alarum
clock
a
birthday
present
struck
five
gwendolen
french
sprang
out
of
bed
and
plunged
her
face
into
the
clump
of
nettles
which
grew
outside
her
lattice
window
for
some
minutes
she
stood
there
breathing
in
the
incense
of
the
day
then
dressing
quickly
she
went
down
into
the
great
kitchen
to
prepare
breakfast
for
her
father
and
the
pigs
as
she
went
about
her
simple
duties
she
sang
softly
to
herself
a
song
of
love
and
knightly
deeds
little
did
she
think
that
a
lover
even
at
that
moment
stood
outside
her
door
sighed
gwendolen
and
she
poured
the
into
a
bowl
and
took
it
up
to
her
father
room
for
eighteen
years
gwendolen
french
had
been
the
daughter
of
john
french
of
primrose
farm
endowed
by
nature
with
a
beauty
that
is
seldom
seen
outside
this
sort
of
story
she
was
yet
as
modest
and
as
good
a
girl
as
was
to
be
found
in
the
county
many
a
fine
lady
would
have
given
all
her
parisian
diamonds
for
the
complexion
which
bloomed
on
the
fair
face
of
gwendolen
but
the
gifts
of
nature
are
not
to
be
bought
and
sold
there
was
a
sudden
knock
at
the
door
come
in
cried
gwendolen
in
surprise
unless
it
was
the
cow
it
was
an
entirely
unexpected
visitor
a
tall
and
handsome
young
man
entered
striking
his
head
violently
against
a
beam
as
he
stepped
into
the
kitchen
good
morning
he
said
repressing
the
remark
which
came
more
readily
to
his
lips
pray
forgive
this
intrusion
the
fact
is
i
have
lost
my
way
and
i
wondered
whether
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
inform
me
as
to
my
whereabouts
recognizing
from
his
conversation
that
she
was
being
addressed
by
a
gentleman
gwendolen
curtsied
this
is
primrose
farm
sir
she
said
i
fear
he
replied
with
a
smile
it
has
been
my
misfortune
never
to
have
heard
so
charming
a
name
before
i
am
lord
beltravers
of
beltravers
castle
beltravers
having
returned
last
night
from
india
i
came
out
for
an
early
stroll
this
morning
and
i
fear
that
i
have
wandered
out
of
my
direction
why
cried
gwendolen
your
lordship
is
miles
from
beltravers
castle
how
tired
and
hungry
you
must
be
she
removed
a
lettuce
from
the
kitchen
chair
dusted
it
and
offered
it
to
him
that
is
to
say
the
chair
not
the
lettuce
let
me
get
you
some
milk
she
added
picking
up
a
pail
she
went
out
to
inspect
the
cow
gad
said
lord
beltravers
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
he
paced
rapidly
up
and
down
the
tiled
kitchen
deuce
take
it
he
added
recklessly
she
a
lovely
girl
the
beltraverses
were
noted
in
two
continents
for
their
hard
swearing
here
you
are
sir
said
gwendolen
returning
with
the
precious
liquid
lord
beltravers
seized
the
pail
and
drained
it
at
a
draught
heavens
but
that
was
good
he
said
what
was
it
milk
said
gwendolen
milk
i
must
remember
and
now
may
i
trespass
on
your
hospitality
still
further
by
trespassing
on
your
assistance
so
far
as
to
solicit
your
help
in
putting
me
far
enough
on
my
path
to
discover
my
way
back
to
beltravers
castle
when
he
was
alone
he
said
that
sentence
again
to
himself
and
wondered
what
had
happened
to
it
i
will
show
you
she
said
simply
they
passed
out
into
the
sunlit
orchard
in
an
apple
tree
a
thrush
was
singing
the
gooseberries
were
beetroots
were
flowering
everywhere

are
very
beautiful
he
said

gwendolen

must
see
you

mother

announced
with
simple
dignity

you
come
thank
you
my
lord

of

as
each

was
announced
by
a
bevy
of
footmen
she
extended
her
perfectly
gloved

his
head
was
the
proud
of
the
beltraverses
a
headless
sardine
on
a
field
of
tomato
as
each
new
arrival
entered
lord
beltravers
scanned
his
or
her
countenance
eagerly
and
then
turned
away
with
a
snarl
of
disappointment
would
his
little
country
maid
never
come
she
came
at
last
attired
in
a
frock
which
had
obviously
been
created
in
little
popley
she
looked
the
picture
of
girlish
innocence
as
she
stood
for
a
moment
hesitating
in
the
doorway
then
her
eyes
brightened
as
lord
beltravers
came
towards
her
with
long
swinging
strides
you
here
he
exclaimed

his
arm
round
her
waist
and
led
her
into

chapter

affianced
the
ball
was
at
its
height
gwendolen
who
had
been
in
to
supper
eight
times
placed
her
hand
timidly
on
the
arm
of
lord
beltravers
who
had
just
begged
a
polka
of
her
let
us
sit
this
out
she
said
not
here
in
the
garden
yes
said
lord
beltravers
gravely
let
us
go
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
offering
her
his
arm
he
led
her
down
the
great
terrace
which
ran
along
the
back
of
the
house
how
wonderful
to
have
your
ancestors
always
around
you
like
this
cooed
gwendolen
as
she
gazed
with
reverence
at
the
two
statues
which
fronted
them
venus
said
lord
beltravers
shortly
and
samson
he
led
her
down
the
steps
and
into
the
ornamental
garden
and
there
they
sat
down
miss
french
said
lord
beltravers
or
if
i
may
call
you
by
that
sweet
name
gwendolen
i
have
brought
you
here
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
offer
to
you
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
in
accordance
with
etiquette
had
i
approached
your
mother
first
mother
is
dead
said
the
girl
simply
i
am
sorry
said
lord
beltravers
bending
his
head
in
courtly
sympathy
in
that
case
i
should
have
asked
your
father
to
hear
my
suit
father
is
deaf
she
replied
he
could
have
heard
it
tut
tut
said
lord
beltravers
impatiently
i
beg
your
pardon
he
added
at
once
i
should
have
controlled
myself
that
being
so
he
went
on
i
have
the
honour
to
make
to
you
miss
french
an
offer
of
marriage
may
i
hope
gwendolen
put
her
hand
suddenly
to
her
heart
the
shock
was
too
much
for
her
fresh
young
innocence
she
was
not
really
engaged
to
giles
earwaker
though
he
too
was
hoping
and
the
only
three
times
that
thomas
ritson
had
kissed
her
she
had
threatened
to
box
his
ears
lord
beltravers
she
began
call
me
beltravers
he
begged
beltravers
i
love
you
i
give
you
a
simple
maiden
heart
my
darling
he
cried
clasping
her
thumb
impulsively
then
we
are
affianced
he
slipped
a
ring
off
his
finger
and
fitted
it
affectionately
on
two
of
hers
wear
this
he
said
gravely
it
was
my
mother
she
was
a
de
dindigul
see
this
is
their
crest
a
herring
over
the
motto
observing
that
she
looked
puzzled
he
translated
the
noble
french
words
to
her
and
now
let
us
go
in
another
dance
is
beginning
may
i
beg
for
the
honour
beltravers
she
whispered
lovingly
chapter
iv
exposure
the
next
dance
was
at
its
height
in
a
dream
of
happiness
gwendolen
revolved
with
closed
eyes
round
lord
beltravers
of
beltravers
castle
beltravers
suddenly
above
the
music
rose
a
voice
commanding
threatening
stop
cried
the
lady
beltravers
as
if
by
magic
the
band
ceased
and
all
the
dancers
were
still
there
is
an
intruder
here
said
lady
beltravers
in
a
cold
voice
a
milkmaid
a
common
farmer
daughter
gwendolen
french
leave
my
house
this
instant
dazed
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
gwendolen
moved
forward
in
an
instant
lord
beltravers
was
after
her
no
mother
he
said
with
the
utmost
dignity
not
a
common
milkmaid
but
the
future
lady
beltravers
an
indescribable
thrill
of
emotion
ran
through
the
crowded
lord
hobble
stud
fell
out
and
lady
susan
golightly
hurried
across
the
room
and
fainted
in
the
arms
of
sir
james
batt
what
cried
the
lady
beltravers
my
son
the
last
of
the
beltraverses
the
beltraverses
who
came
over
with
julius
wernher
i
should
say
cæsar
marry
a
milkmaid
no
mother
he
is
marrying
what
any
man
would
be
proud
to
marry
a
simple
english
girl
there
was
a
cheer
instantly
suppressed
from
a
socialist
in
the
band
for
just
a
moment
words
failed
the
lady
beltravers
then
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
waved
her
guests
away
the
ball
is
over
she
said
slowly
leave
me
my
son
and
i
must
be
alone
one
by
one
with
murmured
thanks
for
a
delightful
evening
the
guests
trooped
out
soon
mother
and
son
were
alone
lord
beltravers
gazing
out
of
the
window
saw
the
laboriously
dragging
his
across
the
park
chapter
v
the
end
and
now
dear
readers
i
am
in
a
difficulty
how
shall
the
story
go
on
the
editor
of
seaside
asks
quite
frankly
for
a
murder
his
idea
was
that
the
lady
beltravers
should
be
found
dead
in
the
park
next
morning
and
that
gwendolen
should
be
arrested
this
seems
to
me
both
crude
and
vulgar
besides
i
want
a
murder
for
no
xcix
of
the
series
severed
no
i
think
i
know
a
better
way
out
old
john
french
sat
beneath
a
spreading
pear
tree
and
waited
early
that
morning
a
mysterious
note
had
been
brought
to
him
asking
for
an
interview
on
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
this
was
the
i
have
come
said
a
voice
behind
him
to
ask
you
to
beg
your
daughter
i
have
come
cried
the
lady
beltravers
to
ask
you
i
have
come
shouted
her
ladyship
to
john
french
wheeled
round
in
amazement
with
a
cry
the
lady
beltravers
shrank
back
eustace
she
gasped
eustace
earl
of
turbot
eliza
what
are
you
doing
here
i
came
to
see
john
french
what
he
asked
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
she
repeated
her
remark
loudly
several
times
i
john
french
he
said
at
last
when
you
refused
me
and
married
beltravers
i
suddenly
felt
tired
of
society
and
i
changed
my
name
and
settled
down
here
as
a
simple
farmer
my
daughter
helps
me
on
the
farm
then
your
daughter
is
lady
gwendolen
hake
a
beautiful
double
wedding
was
solemnized
at
beltravers
in
october
the
earl
of
turbot
leading
eliza
lady
beltravers
to
the
altar
while
lord
beltravers
was
joined
in
matrimony
to
the
beautiful
lady
gwendolen
hake
there
were
many
presents
on
both
sides
which
partook
equally
of
the
beautiful
and
the
costly
lady
gwendolen
beltravers
is
now
the
most
popular
hostess
in
the
county
but
to
her
husband
she
always
seems
the
simple
english
milkmaid
that
he
first
thought
her
ah
the
secret
of
the
army
aeroplane
in
the
thrilling
manner
of
william
le
queux
yes
said
my
friend
ray
raymond
as
a
grim
smile
crossed
his
typically
english
face
looking
round
the
chambers
which
we
shared
together
though
he
never
had
occasion
to
practise
though
i
unfortunately
had
it
is
a
very
curious
affair
indeed
tell
us
the
whole
facts
ray
urged
vera
vallance
the
pretty
daughter
of
admiral
sir
charles
vallance
to
whom
he
was
engaged
well
dear
they
are
briefly
as
follows
he
replied
with
an
affectionate
glance
at
her
it
is
well
known
that
the
germans
are
anxious
to
get
hold
of
our
new
aeroplane
and
that
the
secret
of
it
is
at
present
locked
in
the
inventor
breast
last
tuesday
a
man
with
his
moustache
brushed
up
the
wrong
way
alighted
at
basingstoke
station
and
enquired
for
the
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
a
dastardly
attempt
is
about
to
be
made
to
wrest
the
supremacy
of
the
air
from
our
grasp
immediately
i
swooned
and
even
in
the
face
of
this
the
government
denies
the
activity
of
german
spies
in
england
i
exclaimed
bitterly
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
consciousness
jacox
said
my
old
friend
as
a
patriot
it
is
none
the
less
my
duty
to
expose
these
miscreants
we
go
to
basingstoke
next
thursday
then
saw
us
ensconced
in
our
private
at
the
bull
hotel
basingstoke
on
our
way
from
the
station
i
had
noticed
how
the
town
was
to
resist
invasion
and
i
had
pointed
this
out
bitterly
to
my
dear
old
friend
ray
raymond
yes
he
remarked
grimly
and
it
is
simply
infested
with
spies
jack
my
surmises
are
proving
correct
there
will
be
dangerous
work
afoot
have
you
brought
your
electric
torch
with
you
since
that
rosyth
affair
i
never
travel
without
it
i
replied
as
i
stood
with
my
back
to
the
cheap
so
common
in
english
hotels
the
night
was
dark
therefore
we
proceeded
with
caution
as
we
left
the
inn
the
actions
of
ray
raymond
were
curious
as
we
passed
each
telegraph
pole
he
stopped
and
said
grimly
ah
i
thought
so
and
drew
his
revolver
when
we
had
covered
fifteen
miles
we
looked
at
our
watches
by
the
aid
of
our
electric
torches
and
discovered
that
it
was
time
to
get
back
to
the
hotel
unless
we
wished
our
presence
or
rather
absence
to
be
made
known
to
the
german
spies
therefore
we
returned
hastily
next
morning
ray
was
recalled
to
town
by
an
urgent
telegram
therefore
i
was
left
alone
at
basingstoke
to
foil
the
dastardly
spies
i
stayed
there
for
thirteen
weeks
and
then
went
with
my
old
friend
to
grimsby
he
having
received
news
that
a
german
hairdresser
named
macdonald
was
resident
in
that
town
my
dear
jack
said
my
friend
ray
raymond
his
face
assuming
the
expression
by
which
i
knew
that
he
had
formed
some
theory
for
the
destruction
of
his
country
dastardly
enemies
we
shall
come
to
grips
with
the
teuton
and
yet
i
cried
the
government
refuses
to
admit
the
activity
of
german
spies
in
england
ha
said
my
friend
grimly
he
opened
a
small
black
bag
and
produced
a
dark
lantern
a
coil
of
strong
silk
rope
and
a
small
but
serviceable
jemmy
all
that
burglarious
outfit
belonged
to
my
friend
at
this
moment
the
pretty
fair
girl
to
whom
he
was
engaged
vera
vallance
arrived
but
returned
to
london
by
the
next
train
at
ten
we
proceeded
cautiously
to
the
house
of
macdonald
the
hairdresser
whom
ray
had
discovered
to
be
a
german
spy
have
you
your
electric
torch
with
you
inquired
my
dear
old
college
friend
i
have
i
answered
grimly
good
then
let
us
enter
you
mean
to
break
in
i
cried
amazed
at
the
audacity
of
my
friend
bah
he
said
spies
are
always
cowards
therefore
we
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
opened
by
two
men
the
elder
of
whom
gave
vent
to
a
quick
german
imprecation
the
younger
had
a
short
beard
you
are
a
german
spy
enquired
ray
raymond
no
replied
the
bearded
german
in
very
good
english
adding
with
marvellous
coolness
to
what
pray
do
we
owe
this
unwarrantable
intrusion
to
the
fact
that
you
are
a
spy
who
has
been
taking
secret
tracings
of
our
army
aeroplane
retorted
my
friend
but
the
spy
only
laughed
in
open
defiance
well
there
no
law
against
it
he
replied
no
retorted
ray
grimly
thanks
to
the
stupidity
of
a
crass
government
there
no
law
against
it
my
god
i
said
hoarsely
and
my
face
went
the
colour
of
ashes
but
my
old
friend
jacass
i
mean
jacox
and
i
continued
ray
raymond
fixing
the
miserable
spy
with
his
eye
have
decided
to
take
the
law
into
our
own
hands
i
have
my
revolver
and
my
friend
has
his
electric
torch
give
me
the
tracings
gott
no
cried
the
german
spies
in
german
never
you
english
cur
but
ray
had
already
extracted
a
letter
from
the
elder
man
pocket
and
was
making
for
the
door
i
followed
him
when
we
got
back
to
our
hotel
he
drew
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
eagerly
examined
it
i
give
here
an
exact
copy
of
it
and
i
may
state
that
when
we
sent
it
to
his
majesty
minister
for
war
he
returned
it
without
a
word
berkeley

dear
sir

to
yours

we
beg
to
say

are
sir

obediently
wilkinson
and
allbutt
james
macdonald
that
letter
innocent
enough
upon
the
face
of
it
contained
dastardly
instructions
from
the
chief
of
police
to
a
german
spy
read
by
the
alphabetical
code
supplied
to
every
german
secret
agent

said
my
friend
grimly
we
were
only
just
in
time
had
we
delayed
longer
england
might
have
knelt
at
the
proud
foot
of
a
conqueror
ha
i
replied
briefly
next
morning
we
returned
to
the
chambers
which
we
shared
together
in
london
and
were
joined
by
vera
vallance
the
pretty
fair
daughter
of
admiral
sir
charles
vallance
to
whom
my
old
friend
was
engaged
and
as
he
stroked
her
hair
affectionately
i
realised
thankfully
that
he
and
i
had
indeed
been
the
instruments
of
providence
in
foiling
the
plots
of
the
german
spies
but
how
will
it
all
end
when
will
germany
strike
the
halo
they
gave
themselves
a
collaboration
by
the
authors
of
the
broken
halo
and
the
woman
thou
gavest
me
chapter
i
sunday
morning
barclay
it
was
a
beautiful
sunday
morning
all
nature
browsed
in
solemn
sabbath
stillness
the
little
grey
woman
of
the
was
hurrying
somewhat
late
to
church
down
the
white
ribbon
of
road
the
virile
benedict
of
the
libraries
came
bicycling
treadling
easily
from
the
ankles
he
rode
boldly
with
only
one
hand
on
the
the
other
in
the
pocket
of
his
white
flannel
cricketing
trousers
his
footballing
tie
with
his
college
arms
embroidered
upon
it
flapped
gently
in
the
breeze
to
look
at
him
you
would
have
said
that
he
was
probably
a
crack
polo
player
on
his
way
to
defend
the
championship
against
all
comers
or
the
captain
of
a
county
golf
eleven
as
he
rode
his
soul
overflowing
with
the
joy
of
life
he
hummed
the
collect
for
the
day
it
was
exactly
opposite
the
church
that
he
ran
into
the
little
grey
woman
of
the
he
had
just
flashed
past
a
labourer
in
the
road
known
to
his
cronies
as
the
denizen
of
the
a
labourer
who
in
the
dear
dead
days
of
queen
victoria
would
have
touched
his
hat
humbly
but
who
now
in
this
horrible
age
of
attempts
to
level
all
class
distinctions
actually
went
on
lighting
his
pipe
alas
that
the
respectful
deference
of
the
poor
toward
the
rich
is
now
a
thing
of
the
past
so
thought
the
virile
benedict
of
the
libraries
and
in
thinking
this
he
had
let
his
mind
wander
from
the
important
business
of
guiding
his
bicycle
in
another
moment
he
had
run
into
the
little
grey
woman
of
the
she
had
seen
him
coming
and
had
given
a
warning
cry
but
it
was
too
late
the
next
moment
he
shot
over
his
but
even
as
he
revolved
through
the
air
he
wondered
how
old
she
really
was
and
what
if
any
was
her
income
for
since
the
death
of
the
little
white
lady
he
had
formed
a
habit
of
marrying
elderly
women
for
their
money
and
his
fifth
or
sixth
wife
had
perished
of
old
age
only
a
few
months
ago
waking
up
pray
is
the
little
white
lady
barclay
his
first
wife
she
comes
in
my
book
the
broken
halo
now
in
its
two
hundredth
annoyed
jove
he
said
cheerily
as
he
picked
himself
and
her
and
his
bicycle
up
that
was
a
nasty
spill
as
my
aunt
louisa
used
to
say
to
the
curate
when
he
upset
the
into
her
lap
milk
thank
you
his
brown
eyes
danced
with
amusement
as
he
related
this
reminiscence
of
his
boyhood
to
the
little
grey
woman
he
seemed
to
exhale
youth
from
every
pore
what
did
your
aunt
louisa
say
when
her
ankle
was
sprained
she
asked
with
a
rueful
smile
in
an
instant
the
merry
banter
faded
from
the
virile
benedict
brown
eyes
and
was
replaced
by
the
commanding
look
of
one
who
has
taken
a
brilliant
degree
in
all
his
medical
examinations
allow
me
he
said
brusquely
i
am
a
doctor
he
bent
down
and
listened
to
her
ankle
it
did
not
take
dick
cameron
quick
ear
long
to
find
out
all
there
was
to
know
his
manner
became
very
gentle
and
his
voice
very
low
and
though
he
continued
to
exhale
youth
he
did
it
less
ostentatiously
than
before
i
must
carry
you
home
he
said
picking
her
up
in
his
strong
young
arms
you
can
not
go
to
church
but
the
curate
is
preaching
dick
murmured
something
profane
under
his
breath
about
curates
he
had
alas
these
moments
of
irreverence
as
for
instance
on
one
occasion
when
he
had
spoken
of
louis
parker
noble
joseph
and
his
brethren
quite
shortly
as
jos
i
will
carry
you
home
he
said
gently
tell
me
where
you
live
little
grey
woman
she
smiled
up
at
him
bravely
the
manor
house
she
said
his
voice
became
yet
more
gentle
and
now
tell
me
your
income
he
whispered
and
his
whole
being
trembled
with
emotion
as
he
waited
for
her
reply
barclay
there
that
the
end
of
the
chapter
now
it
your
waking
up
do
know
if
i
told
you
that
in
my
last
great
work
of
the
imagination
in
which
i
collaborated
with
the
bishop
of
london
i
wrote
throughout
in
the
first
person
nearly
a
million
copies
were
sold
thus
showing
that
the
heart
of
the
great
public
approved
of
my
method
of
telling
my
story
through
the
mouth
of
a
young
and
innocent
girl
exposed
to
great
temptation
i
should
wish
therefore
to
repeat
that
method
in
this
story
if
you
could
so
arrange
barclay
but
that
easy
the
little
grey
woman
shall
tell
dick
the
story
of
her
first
marriage
i
did
that
in
my
last
book
the
broken
halo
now
in
its
two
hundredth
annoyed
chapter
ii
under
the
cedar
barclay
they
were
having
tea
in
the
garden
the
little
grey
woman
and
dick
more
than
six
months
had
elapsed
since
the
accident
outside
the
church
and
dick
still
remained
on
at
the
manor
house
in
charge
of
his

a
thrush
was
singing
how
fresh

green

sighed
dick
leaning
back
and
exhaling
youth
as
the
curate
used
to
say
to
my

delightful
shower
after
the
rain
he
laughed
merrily
and
threw
a
crumb
at
the
thrush
with
the
perfect
aim
of
a
good
cricketer
throwing
the
ball
at
the
wickets
my
dear
boy
said
the
little
grey
woman
the
world
is
always
fresh
and
green
to
youth
like
yours
but
to
an
old
woman
like

with
an
ardent
glance
only

marry

she
looked
at
him
with
a
sad
but
tender
smile
what
my
friends
say
she
asked
bother
your

my
dear

that
if

shall
be
required
to

to

pleaded

of

in
his
brown
eyes
the
little
grey

looked
at
him
tenderly
their
eyes
met

she
said

will
tell

the
story
of
my

and
then

beauchamp
story
hall
caine
up
the
i
have
always
had
a
wonderful
memory
and
my
earliest
recollection
is
of
hearing
my
father
ask
on
the
day
when
i
was
born
whether
it
was
a
boy
or
a
girl
when
they
told
him
a
girl
he
let
fall
a
rough
expression
which
sent
the
blood
coursing
over
my
mother
pale
cheeks
like
coursing
over
a
turbot
my
father
john
boomster
was
a
great
advertising
agent
perhaps
the
greatest
in
the
island
though
he
always
said
that
there
was
one
man
who
could
beat
him
he
wanted
a
son
to
succeed
him
in
the
business
and
in
the
years
to
come
he
never
forgave
me
for
being
a
girl
he
would
often
glare
at
me
in
silence
for
of
an
hour
and
then
letting
fall
the
same
rough
expression
throw
a
boot
at
me
and
stride
from
the
room
a
hard
cruel
man
my
father
and
yet
in
his
fashion
he
was
fond
of
me
it
was
not
until
i
was
eighteen
that
he
first
spoke
to
me
to
my
dying
day
i
shall
never
forget
that
evening
nor
his
words
which
bit
themselves
into
my
mind
as
a
iron
bites
its
way
into
cheese
nell
he
said
for
that
was
my
name
though
he
had
never
used
it
before
i
arranged
that
you
are
to
marry
lord
wurzel
two
months
from
at
these
terrible
words
the
blood
ebbed
slowly
from
my
ears
and
my
hands
grew
hot
i
do
not
know
him
i
said
in
a
stifled
voice
you
will
he
laughed
brutally
and
with
another
rough
word
he
strode
from
the
room
lord
wurzel
i
ran
upstairs
to
my
room
and
flung
myself
face
downwards
on
the
bed
in
my
agony
i
bit
a
large
piece
out
of
my
pillow
the
blood
flowed
forward
and
backward
over
me
in
waves
and
i
burst
every
now
and
then
into
a
passion
of
weeping
by
and
by
i
began
to
feel
more
serene
i
decided
that
it
was
my
duty
to
obey
my
father
my
heart
leapt
within
me
at
the
thought
of
doing
my
duty
and
to
calm
myself
i
put
on
my
hat
and
wandered
into
the
glen
it
was
very
silent
in
the
glen
there
was
no
sound
but
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
overhead
the
popping
of
the
insects
underfoot
the
sneezing
of
the
cattle
the
whistling
of
the
pigs
the
coughing
of
the
the
roaring
of
the
rabbits
and
the
deep
of
the
sea
but
suddenly
above
all
these
noises
i
heard
a
voice
which
sent
the
blood
ebbing
and
flowing
in
my
heart
and
caused
the
back
of
my
neck
to
quiver
with
ecstasy
nell
it
said
it
was
the
voice
of
my
old
comrade
andrew
spinnaker
who
had
played
with
me
in
our
childhood
days
and
whom
i
had
not
seen
now
for
eight
years
andrew
i
cried
as
i
turned
round
what
are
you
doing
here
i
am
just
off
to
discover
the
south
pole
he
said
my
shipmates
are
waiting
for
me
to
command
the
expedition
i
noticed
then
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
dressed
in
a
cap
and
a
pair
of
nell
he
went
on
before
i
go
tell
me
you
love
me
my
heart
fluttered
like
a
captured
bird
my
knees
trembled
like
a
drunken
spider
my
throat
was
stifled
like
a
stifled
throat
a
huge
wave
of
something
or
other
surged
over
me
and
told
me
that
the
great
mystery
of
the
world
had
happened
to
me
i
was
in
love
i
was
in
love
with
andrew
spinnaker
andrew
i
cried
falling
on
his
startled
chin
i
love
you
all
the
back
of
my
neck
thrilled
with
joy
but
my
joy
was
shortlived
no
sooner
had
i
become
aware
that
i
loved
andrew
spinnaker
than
my
conscience
told
me
i
had
no
right
to
do
so
i
was
going
to
marry
lord
wurzel
and
to
love
another
than
my
husband
was
sin
i
shook
andrew
off
my
lips
i
love
you
i
said
but
i
can
not
marry
you
i
am
marrying
lord
wurzel
that
beast
cried
andrew
in
the
impetuous
sailor
fashion
which
so
endeared
him
to
his
shipmates
when
i
come
back
i
will
thrash
him
as
i
would
thrash
a
vicious
ape
when
will
that
be
in
about
two
months
said
my
darling
boy
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
quick
expedition
alas
that
will
be
my
wedding
day
i
said
with
a
low
sob
like
that
of
a
buffalo
yearning
for
its
mate
it
will
be
too
late
andrew
took
me
in
his
strong
arms
i
should
not
have
let
him
but
i
could
not
help
it
listen
he
said
i
will
start
back
from
the
pole
a
day
before
my
shipmates
and
save
you
from
that
beast
and
then
i
will
marry
you
nell
there
was
a
roaring
in
my
ears
like
the
roaring
of
the
bath
when
the
tap
is
left
on
many
waters
seemed
to
rush
upon
me
my
hat
fell
off
and
then
deep
oblivion
came
over
me
and
i
swooned
to
go
through
my
emotions
in
detail
during
the
next
two
months
would
be
but
to
harrow
you
needlessly
suffice
it
to
say
that
seventeen
times
i
flung
myself
face
downwards
on
my
bed
and
bit
a
piece
out
of
the
pillow
on
occasions
the
blood
ebbed
slowly
from
my
face
and
my
heart
fluttered
like
a
captured
bird
while
in
a
hundred
and
forty
instances
a
wave
of
emotion
surged
slowly
over
my
whole
body
leaving
me
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
otherwise
my
health
remained
good
it
was
the
night
before
the
wedding
the
bad
lord
wurzel
had
just
left
me
with
words
of
love
upon
his
lying
lips
unless
andrew
spinnaker
saved
me
i
should
be
lady
wurzel

our
faithful
old

by
the
chimney
i
brought
it
myself
to
be
sure
you
got
it
with
trembling
fingers
i
tore
it
open
how
my
heart
leapt
and
the
hot
colour
flooded
my
neck
and
brow
when
i
recognised
the
dear

one
december
night
when
he
suddenly
comes
across
the
dead
body
of
a
man
of
about
forty
years
to
his
horror
he
recognises
it
to
be
that
of
his
friend
sir
eustace
butt
who
has
been
stabbed
in
seven
places
much
perturbed
by
the
incident
roger
goes
home
and
decides
to
lead
a
new
life
hitherto
he
had
been
notorious
in
the
london
clubs
for
his
luxurious
habits
but
now
he
rises
at
every
morning
and
breathes
evenly
through
the
nose
for
five
minutes
before
dressing
after
three
weeks
of
the
breathing
exercise
roger
adds
a
few
simple
lunges
to
his
morning
drill
frenchard
tells
him
that
he
has
a
clue
to
the
death
of
sir
eustace
but
that
the
murderer
is
still
at
large
roger
sells
his
london
house
and
takes
a
cottage
in
the
country
where
he
practises
the
simple
life
he
is
now
lunging
ten
times
to
the
right
ten
times
to
the
left
and
ten
times
backwards
every
morning
besides
breathing
lightly
through
the
nose
during
his
bath
one
day
he
meets
a
yogi
who
tells
him
that
if
he
desires
to
track
the
murderer
down
he
must
learn
concentration
he
suggests
that
roger
should
start
by
concentrating
on
the
word
wardrobe
and
then
leaves
this
story
and
goes
back
to
india
roger
sells
his
house
in
the
country
and
comes
back
to
town
where
he
concentrates
for
half
an
hour
daily
on
the
word
wardrobe
besides
of
course
persevering
with
his
breathing
and
lunging
exercises
after
a
heavy
morning
drill
he
is
passing
through
gordon
square
when
he
comes
across
the
body
of
his
old
friend
sir
joshua

who
has
been

times

the
appalling
death
of
sir
joshua

following
so
closely
upon
that
of
sir
eustace

meant
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
for
roger
his
morning
drill
now
took
the
following
form
on
rising
at
he
sipped
a
glass
of
distilled
water
at
the
same
time
concentrating
on
the
word
wardrobe
this
lasted
for
ten
minutes
after
which
he
stood
before
the
open
window
for
five
minutes
breathing
alternately
through
the
right
ear
and
the
left
a
vigorous
series
of
lunges
followed
together
with
the
simple
kicking
exercises
detailed
in
chapter
liv
these
over
there
was
a
brief
interval
of
rest
during
which
our
hero
breathing
heavily
through
the
back
of
the
head
concentrated
on
the
word
refreshed
by
the
mental
discipline
he
rose
and
stood
lightly
on
the
ball
of
his
left
foot
at
the
same
time
massaging
himself
vigorously
between
the
shoulders
with
his
right
after
five
minutes
of
this
he
would
rest
again
lying
motionless
except
for
a
circular
movement
of
the
ears
a
cold
bath
a
brisk
rub
down
and
another
glass
of
distilled
water
completed
the
morning
training
but
it
is
time
we
got
on
with
the
story
the
murder
of
sir
joshua
tubbs
had
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
through
england
and
hundreds
of
people
wrote
indignant
letters
to
the
press
blaming
the
police
for
their
neglect
to
discover
the
assassin
frenchard
however
was
hard
at
work
and
he
was
inspired
by
the
knowledge
that
he
could
always
rely
upon
the
assistance
of
roger
dangerfield
the
famous
barrister
who
had
sworn
to
track
the
murderer
down
to
prepare
himself
for
the
forthcoming
struggle
roger
decided
one
sunny
day
in
june
to
give
up
the
meat
diet
upon
which
he
had
relied
so
long
and
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
a
vegetable
with
that
thoroughness
which
was
now
becoming
a
characteristic
of
him
he
left
london
and
returned
to
the
country
with
the
intention
of
making
a
study

a
beautiful

roger
rose
at
and
performed
those
gentle
exercises
which
have
already
been
described
in
previous
chapters
on
this
glorious
morning
however
he
added
a
simple
exercise
for
the
elbows
to
his
customary
ones
and
went
down
to
his
breakfast
as
hungry
as
the
proverbial
hunter
a
substantial
meal
of
five
dried
beans
and
a
stewed
nut
awaited
him
in
the
fine
library
and
as
he
did
ample
justice
to
the
banquet
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
terrible
days
when
he
lived
the
luxurious
life
of
the
ordinary
to
the
evening
when
he
discovered
the
body
of
sir
eustace
butt
and
swore
to
bring
the
assassin
to
vengeance
to
the
day
when
suddenly
he
realised
that
his
thoughts
were
wandering
with
iron
will
he
controlled
them
and
concentrated
fixedly
on
the
word
for
twelve
minutes
greatly
refreshed
he
rose
and
strode
out
into
the
sun
at
the
door
of
his
cottage
a
girl
was
standing
she
was
extremely
beautiful
and
roger
heart
would
have
jumped
if
he
had
not
had
that
organ

to
twisting

under
perfect
control
is
this

with
regularity
concentrating
daily
upon
the
words

and
living
entirely
upon
proteids
one
day
he
had
the
idea
that
he
would
start
a
restaurant
in
the
for
the
sale
of
meatless
foods
this
would
bring
him
in
touch
with

he
expected
to
find
the
assassin

his
two
oldest
friends

frenchard
stabbed
in
eleven
places
roger
hurried
madly
home
and
devised
an
entirely
new
set
of
exercises
for
his
morning
drill
a
full
description
of
these
however
must
be
reserved
for
another
chapter
so
on
for
merely
players
on
the
bat
back
with
the
idea
of
brightening
cricket
my
friend
twyford
has
given
me
a
new
bat
i
have
always
felt
that
in
my
own
case
it
was
the
inadequacy
of
the
weapon
rather
than
of
the
man
behind
it
which
accounted
for
a
certain
monotony
of
with
this
new
bat
i
hope
to
prove
the
correctness
of
my
theory
my
old
bat
has
always
been
a
trier
but
of
late
it
has
been
manifestly
past
its
work
again
and
again
its
drive
over
head
has
failed
to
carry
the
bunker
at
more
than
once
it
has
proved
itself
an
inch
too
narrow
to
ensure
that
which
is
considered
one
of
the
most
graceful
strokes
in
my
repertoire
worst
of
all
i
have
found
it
at
moments
of
crisis
such
as
the
beginning
of
the
first
over
utterly
inadequate
to
deal
with
the
ball
which
keeps
low
when
bowled
by
such
a
ball
and
i
may
say
that
i
am
never
bowled
by
any
other
i
look
reproachfully
at
the
bottom
of
my
bat
as
i
walk
back
to
the
pavilion
surely
i
say
to
it
you
were
much
longer
than
this
when
we
started
out
perhaps
it
was
not
magnanimous
always
to
put
the
blame
on
my
partner
for
our
accidents
together
it
would
have
been
more
chivalrous
to
have
shielded
him
no
no
i
should
have
said
to
my
companions
as
they
received
me
with
sympathetic
murmurs
of
bad
luck
no
no
you
must
think
that
it
was
my
own
fault
do
reproach
the
bat
it
would
have
been
well
to
have
spoken
thus
and
indeed
when
i
had
had
time
to
collect
myself
i
did
so
speak
but
out
on
the
field
in
the
first
shame
of
defeat
i
had
to
let
the
truth
come
out
that
one
reproachful
glance
at
my
bat
i
could
not
hide
but
there
was
one
habit
of
my
bat
a
weakness
of
old
age
i
admit
but
not
the
less
annoying
about
which
it
was
my
duty
to
let
all
the
world
know
one
grandfather
may
have
a
passion
for
the
gum
on
the
back
of
and
one
hushes
it
up
but
if
he
be
deaf
the
visitor
must
be
warned
my
bat
had
a
certain
looseness
in
the
shoulder
so
that
at
any
quick
movement
of
it
it
clicked
if
i
struck
the
ball
well
and
truly
in
the
direction
of
point
this
defect
did
not
matter
but
if
the
ball
went
past
me
into
the
hands
of
the
an
unobservant
bowler
would
frequently
say
how
that
and
an
umpire
would
reply
out
it
was
my
duty
before
the
game
began
to
take
the
visiting
umpire
on
one
side
and
give
him
a
practical
demonstration
of
the
click
but
these
are
troubles
of
the
past
i
have
my
new
bat
now
and
i
can
see
that
cricket
will
become
a
different
game
for
me
my
practice
of
this
morning
has
convinced
me
of
this
it
was
not
one
of
your
stupid
practices
at
the
net
with
two
burly
professionals
bumping
down
balls
at
your
body
and
telling
you
to
come
out
to
them
sir
it
was
a
quiet
practice
in
my
rooms
after
breakfast
with
no
moving
object
to
distract
my
attention
and
spoil
my
stroke
the
bat
comes
up
well
it
is
light
and
yet
there
is
plenty
of
wood
in
it
its
drives
along
the
carpet
were
excellent
its
cuts
and
leg
glides
all
that
could
be
wished
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
its
hook
which
dislodged
a
teacup
and
gave
what
would
have
been
an
easy
catch
to
standing
close
in
by
the
sofa
but
i
am
convinced
that
a
little
oil
will
soon
put
that
right
and
yet
there
seemed
to
be
something
lacking
in
it
after
trying
every
stroke
with
it
after
tucking
it
under
my
arm
and
walking
back
to
the
bathroom
touching
my
cap
at
the
pianola
on
the
way
after
experiments
with
it
in
all
positions
i
still
felt
that
there
was
something
wanting
to
make
it
the
perfect
bat
so
i
put
it
in
a
cab
and
went
round
with
it
to
henry
henry
has
brightened
cricket
for
some
years
now
tell
me
henry
i
said
what
wrong
with
this
bat
it
seems
all
right
he
said
after
waving
it
about
rather
a
good
one
i
laid
it
down
on
the
floor
and
looked
at
it
then
i
turned
it
on
its
face
and
looked
at
it
and
then
i
knew
it
wants
a
little
silver
shield
on
the
back
i
said
that
it
why
is
it
a
presentation
bat
asked
henry
in
a
sense
yes
it
was
presented
to
me
by
twyford
what
for
really
i
said
modestly
i
hardly
like
why
do
people
give
one
things
affection
henry
pity
generosity
er
are
you
going
to
put
that
on
the
shield
out
of
sheer
pity
to
do
be
silly
of
course
not
i
shall
put
in
commemoration
of
his
masterly
double
century
against
the
authentics
or
something
like
that
you
no
idea
how
it
impresses
the
he
really
sees
quite
a
lot
of
the
back
of
one
bat
your
inscription
said
henry
as
he
filled
his
pipe
slowly
will
be
either
a
lie
or
extremely
unimpressive
it
will
be
neither
henry
if
i
put
my
own
name
on
it
and
talked
about
double
century
of
course
it
would
be
a
lie
but
the
inscription
will
be
to
stanley
bolland
who
he
i
do
know
i
just
made
him
up
but
now
supposing
my
little
shield
says
bolland
season
batting
average
how
is
that
a
lie
what
does
stand
for
i
do
know
it
does
mean
anything
really
i
leave
out
average
if
it
makes
it
more
truthful
bolland
it
really
just
a
little
note
i
make
on
the
back
of
my
bat
to
remind
me
of
something
or
other
i
forgotten
is
probably
bolland
telephone
number
or
the
size
of
something
i
want
at
his
shop
but
by
a
pure
accident
the
thinks
it
means
something
else
and
he
tells
the
bowler
at
the
end
of
the
over
that
it
that
chap
bolland
who
had
an
average
of
over
a
century
for
the
hampstead
polytechnic
last
year
of
course
that
makes
the
bowler
nervous
and
he
starts
sending
down
i
see
said
henry
and
he
began
to
read
his
paper
again
so
i
take
my
bat
to
the
silversmith
and
have
a
little
engraved
shield
fastened
on
of
course
with
a
really
trustworthy
weapon
i
am
certain
to
collect
pots
of
runs
this
season
but
there
is
no
harm
in
making
things
as
easy
as
possible
for
oneself
and
yet
there
is
this
to
be
thought
of
even
the
very
best
bat
in
the
world
may
fail
to
score
and
it
might
so
happen
that
i
was
dismissed
owing
to
some
defect
in
the
pitch
before
my
silver
shield
had
time
to
impress
the
opposition
or
again
i
might
through
perform
so
badly
that
quite
a
wrong
impression
of
the
standard
of
the
hampstead
polytechnic
would
be
created
an
impression
which
i
should
hate
to
be
the
innocent
means
of
circulating
so
on
second
thoughts
i
lean
to
a
different
inscription
on
the
back
of
my
bat
a
plain
silver
shield
will
say
quite
simply
this
to
stanley
bolland
for
saving
life
at
sea
from
a
few
admirers
thus
i
shall
have
two
strings
to
my
bow
and
if
by
any
unhappy
chance
i
fail
as
a
cricketer
the
will
say
to
his
comrades
as
i
walk
sadly
to
the
pavilion
a
poor
bat
perhaps
but
a
brave
a
very
brave
fellow
it
becomes
us
all
to
make
at
least
one
effort
to
brighten
cricket
uncle
edward
celia
has
more
relations
than
would
seem
possible
i
am
gradually
getting
to
know
some
them
by
sight
and
a
few
more
by
name
but
i
still
make
mistakes
the
other
day
for
instance
she
happened
to
say
she
was
going
to
a
concert
with
uncle
godfrey
godfrey
i
said
godfrey
no
do
tell
me
i
shall
get
it
in
a
moment
godfrey
yes
that
it
he
the
architect
he
lives
at
liverpool
has
five
children
and
sent
us
the
as
a
wedding
present
no
marks
said
celia
then
he
the
unmarried
one
in
scotland
who
breeds
terriers
i
knew
i
should
get
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
lives
in
london
and
breeds
oratorios
it
the
same
idea
that
was
the
one
i
meant
the
great
point
is
that
i
placed
him
now
give
me
another
one
i
leant
forward
eagerly
well
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
have
you
arranged
anything
about
monday
monday
i
said
monday
no
do
tell
me
i
shall
get
it
in
a
moment
monday
he
the
one
who
oh
you
mean
the
day
of
the
week
who
a
funny
asked
celia
of
the
teapot
sorry
i
really
thought
you
meant
another
relation
what
am
i
doing
i
playing
golf
if
i
can
find
somebody
to
play
with
well
ask
edward
i
could
place
edward
at
once
edward
i
need
hardly
say
is
uncle
one
of
the
ones
i
have
not
yet
met
he
married
a
very
young
aunt
of
hers
not
much
older
than
celia
but
i
do
know
him
i
said
it
does
matter
write
and
ask
him
to
meet
you
at
the
golf
club
sure
he
love
to
would
he
think
it
rather
cool
this
sudden
attack
from
a
perfectly
unknown
nephew
i
fancy
the
first
step
ought
to
come
from
uncle
but
you
older
than
he
is
true
it
rather
a
tricky
point
in
etiquette
well
i
risk
it
this
was
the
letter
i
sent
to
him
my
dear
uncle
edward
why
have
you
written
to
me
this
term
i
have
spent
the
five
shillings
you
gave
me
when
i
came
back
it
was
awfully
ripping
of
you
to
give
it
to
me
but
i
have
spent
it
now
are
you
coming
down
to
see
me
this
term
if
you
are
you
might
write
to
me
there
is
a
here
where
you
can
change
postal
orders
what
i
really
meant
to
say
was
can
you
play
golf
with
me
on
monday
at
mudbury
hill
i
am
your
new
and
favourite
nephew
and
it
is
quite
time
we
met
be
at
the
at
if
you
can
i
do
quite
know
how
we
shall
recognize
each
other
but
the
man
in
the
suit
will
probably
be
me
my
features
are
plain
but
good
except
where
i
fell
against
the
yesterday
if
you
have
fallen
against
anything
which
would
give
me
a
clue
to
your
face
you
might
let
me
know
also
you
might
let
me
know
if
you
are
a
professor
at
golf
if
you
are
i
will
read
some
more
books
on
the
subject
between
now
and
monday
just
at
the
moment
my
game
is
putrid
your
niece
and
my
wife
sends
her
love
i
was
top
of
my
class
in
latin
last
week
i
must
now
stop
as
it
is
my
i
am
your
loving
nephew
the
next
day
i
had
a
letter
from
my
uncle
my
dear
nephew
i
was
so
glad
to
get
your
nice
little
letter
and
to
hear
that
you
were
working
hard
let
me
know
when
it
is
your
again
these
things
always
interest
me
i
shall
be
delighted
to
play
golf
with
you
on
monday
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
me
i
should
describe
myself
roughly
as
something
like
apollo
and
something
like
little
tich
if
you
know
what
i
mean
it
depends
how
you
come
up
to
me
i
am
an
excellent
golfer
and
never
take
more
than
two
putts
in
a
bunker
till
then
i
enclose
a
for
sixpence
to
see
you
through
the
rest
of
the
term
your
favourite
uncle
edward
i
showed
it
to
celia
perhaps
you
could
describe
him
more
minutely
i
said
i
hate
wandering
about
vaguely
and
asking
everybody
i
see
if
he
my
uncle
it
seems
so
odd
you
sure
to
meet
all
right
said
celia
confidently
he
well
he
and
and
and
oh
recognize
him
at
on
monday
i
arrived
at
the
and
waited
for
my
uncle
various
people
appeared
but
none
seemed
in
want
of
a
nephew
when
came
there
was
still
no
available
uncle
true
there
was
one
unattached
man
reading
in
a
corner
of
the
but
he
had
a
moustache
the
sort
of
heavy
moustache
one
associates
with
a
major
at
three
i
became
desperate
after
all
celia
had
not
seen
edward
for
some
time
perhaps
he
had
grown
a
moustache
lately
perhaps
he
had
grown
one
specially
for
at
any
rate
there
would
be
no
harm
in
asking
this
major
man
if
he
was
my
uncle
even
if
he
was
he
might
give
me
a
game
of
golf
excuse
me
i
said
politely
but
are
you
by
any
chance
my
uncle
edward
your
i
was
almost
certain
you
were
but
i
thought
i
just
ask
sorry
not
at
all
naturally
one
wants
to
find
one
uncle
have
you
er
lost
him
long
years
i
said
sadly
er
i
wonder
if
you
would
care
to
adopt
me
i
mean
give
me
a
game
this
afternoon
my
man
has
turned
up
by
all
means
i
not
very
great
neither
am
shall
we
start
now
good
i
was
sorry
to
miss
edward
but
i
was
going
to
miss
a
game
of
golf
on
such
a
lovely
day
my
spirits
rose
not
even
the
fact
that
there
were
no
caddies
left
and
i
had
to
carry
my
own
clubs
could
depress
me
the
major
drove
i
am
not
going
to
describe
the
whole
game
though
my
cleek
shot
at
the
fifth
hole
from
a
hanging
lie
to
within
two
feet
of
the
however
i
must
go
into
that
now
but
it
surprised
the
major
a
good
deal
and
when
at
the
next
hole
i
laid
my
brassie
absolutely
dead
he
but
i
can
tell
you
about
that
some
other
time
it
is
sufficient
to
say
now
that
when
we
reached
the
seventeenth
tee
i
was
one
up
we
both
played
the
seventeenth
well
he
was
a
foot
from
the
hole
in
four
i
played
my
third
from
the
edge
of
the
green
and
was
ridiculously
short
giving
myself
a
putt
for
the
hole
leaving
my
clubs
i
went
forward
with
the
putter
and
by
the
absurdest
luck
pushed
the
ball
in
good
said
the
major
your
game
i
went
back
for
my
clubs
when
i
turned
round
the
major
was
walking
carelessly
off
to
the
next
tee
leaving
the
flag
lying
on
the
green
and
my
ball
still
in
the
tin
slacker
i
said
to
myself
and
walked
up
to
the
hole
and
then
i
had
a
terrible
shock
i
saw
in
the
tin
not
my
ball
but
a
moustache
am
i
going
mad
i
said
i
could
have
sworn
that
i
drove
off
with
a
and
yet
i
seem
to
have
holed
out
with
a
major
moustache
i
picked
it
up
and
hurried
after
him
major
i
said
excuse
me
you
dropped
your
moustache
it
fell
off
at
the
critical
stage
of
the
match
the
shock
of
losing
was
too
much
for
you
the
strain
of
he
turned
his
face
round
and
grinned
at
me
on
second
thoughts
he
said
i
your
uncle
the
renascence
of
britain
peter
riley
was
one
of
those
lucky
people
who
take
naturally
to
games
actually
he
got
his
blue
for
cricket
rugger
and
boxing
but
his
perfect
eye
and
wrist
made
him
a
beautiful
player
of
any
game
with
a
ball
also
he
rode
and
shot
well
and
knew
all
about
the
inside
of
a
car
but
although
he
was
always
enthusiastic
about
anything
he
was
doing
he
was
not
really
keen
on
games
he
preferred
wandering
about
the
country
looking
for
birds
nests
or
discovering
the
haunts
of
rare
butterflies
he
liked
managing
a
small
boat
in
a
stiff
breeze
he
would
have
enjoyed
being
upset
and
having
to
swim
a
long
way
to
shore
most
of
all
perhaps
he
loved
to
lie
on
the
top
of
the
cliffs
and
think
of
the
wonderful
things
that
he
would
do
for
england
when
he
was
a
cabinet
minister
for
politics
was
to
be
his
profession
and
he
had
just
taken
a
first
in
history
by
way
of
preparation
for
it
there
were
a
lot
of
silly
people
who
envied
peter
mother
they
thought
poor
dears
that
she
must
be
very
very
proud
of
him
for
they
regarded
peter
as
the
ideal
of
the
modern
young
englishman
if
only
my
boy
grows
up
to
be
like
peter
riley
they
used
to
say
to
themselves
and
then
add
quickly
but
of
course
he
be
much
nicer
in
their
ignorance
they
did
see
that
it
was
the
peters
of
england
who
were
making
our
country
the
of
the
world
if
you
had
been
in
berlin
in
you
would
have
seen
peter
for
he
had
been
persuaded
much
against
his
will
to
uphold
the
honour
of
great
britain
in
the
at
the
olympic
games
he
got
a
position
in
the
papers
as
riley
disqualified
the
result
he
could
only
suppose
of
his
folly
in
allowing
his
opponent
to
butt
him
in
the
stomach
he
was
both
annoyed
and
amused
about
it
offered
to
fight
his
vanquisher
any
time
in
england
and
privately
thanked
heaven
that
he
could
now
get
back
to
london
in
time
for
his
favourite
sister
wedding
but
he
did
the
english
trainer
who
had
been
sent
at
the
public
expense
to
america
for
a
year
to
study
the
proper
methods
got
hold
of
him
i
been
watching
you
young
man
he
said
you
have
to
give
yourself
up
to
me
now
you
the
coming
champion
i
sorry
said
peter
politely
but
i
sha
be
fighting
again
fighting
said
the
trainer
scornfully
do
you
worry
i
take
good
care
that
you
do
fight
any
more
the
event
going
to
win
is
the
chisel
i
been
watching
you
and
you
got
the
most
perfect
neck
and
for
it
i
ever
seen
no
more
fighting
for
you
my
boy
nor
cricket
nor
anything
else
i
not
going
to
let
you
spoil
those
muscles
i
do
think
i
ever
pushed
the
chisel
said
peter
besides
over
is
it
over
of
course
it
over
and
that
confounded
american
won
old
england
as
all
the
papers
said
then
it
too
late
to
begin
to
practise
said
peter
thankfully
well
it
too
late
for
the
games
but
we
can
do
a
lot
in
eight
years
and
i
think
i
can
get
you
fit
for
the
games
at
pekin
peter
stared
at
him
in
amazement
my
good
man
he
said
at
last
in
i
shall
be
in
london
and
i
hope
in
the
house
of
commons
and
what
about
the
honour
of
your
country
do
you
want
to
read
the
jeers
in
the
american
papers
when
we
lose
the
chisel
in
i
do
care
a
curse
what
the
american
papers
say
said
peter
angrily
then
you
very
different
from
other
englishmen
said
the
trainer
sternly
of
course
peter
was
persuaded
he
could
let
england
be
the
of
the
world
so
for
eight
years
he
lived
under
the
eye
of
the
trainer
rising
at
five
and
retiring
to
bed
at
this
prevented
him
from
taking
much
part
in
the
ordinary
social
activities
of
the
evening
and
even
his
luncheon
and
invitations
had
to
be
declined
in
some
such
words
as
peter
riley
regrets
that
he
is
unable
to
accept
lady
vavasour
kind
invitation
for
monday
the
as
he
will
be
hopping
round
the
garden
on
one
leg
then
his
career
too
had
to
be
abandoned
for
it
was
plain
that
even
if
he
had
the
leisure
to
get
into
parliament
the
early
hours
he
kept
would
not
allow
him
to
take
part
in
any
important
divisions
but
there
were
compensations
as
he
watched
his
calves
swell
as
he
looked
in
the
glass
and
noticed
each
morning
that
his
head
was
a
little
more
on
one
side
sure
sign
of
the
expert
as
still
surer
sign
his
hands
became
more
knuckly
and
his
mouth
remained
more
permanently
open
he
knew
that
his
devotion
to
duty
would
not
be
without
its
reward
he
saw
already
his
country
triumphing
and
heard
the
chorus
of
congratulation
in
the
newspapers
that
england
was
still
a
nation
of
sportsmen
in
pekin
was
crowded
there
were
of
course
the
ordinary
million
inhabitants
and
in
addition
people
had
thronged
from
all
parts
to
see
the
great
of
whom
so
much
had
been
heard
that
they
did
not
come
in
vain
we
in
london
knew
one
july
morning
as
we
opened
our
papers
pushing
the
chisel
riley
great
britain
in
world
record
biffpoffer
america
in
a
wafer
america
was
disqualified
for
going
outside
the
wood
and
so
england
was
herself
again
there
was
only
one
discordant
note
in
her
triumph
vaile
pointed
out
in
all
the
papers
that
peter
riley
in
the
usual
english
way
had
been
employing
entirely
the
wrong
grip
vaile
book
to
push
the
illustrated
with
full
plates
of
vaile
in
knickerbockers
pushing
the
chisel
explained
the
correct
method
the
birthday
present
it
my
birthday
said
jeremy
as
she
turned
the
pages
of
her
engagement
book
bless
us
so
it
is
said
jeremy
you
or
or
something
i
must
go
and
examine
the
i
believe
one
bottle
left
in
the
apollinaris
bin
it
the
only
stuff
in
the
house
that
fizzes
jeremy
i
only
you
do
look
it
darling
i
mean
you
do
look
it
dear
what
i
mean
well
never
mind
that
let
talk
about
birthday
presents
think
of
something
absolutely
tremendous
for
me
to
give
you
a
rope
of
pearls
i
did
mean
that
sort
of
tremendousness
said
jeremy
quickly
anyone
could
give
you
a
rope
of
pearls
it
simply
a
question
of
overdrawing
enough
from
the
bank
i
meant
something
difficult
that
would
really
prove
my
love
for
you
like
lloyd
george
ear
or
the
something
where
i
could
kill
somebody
for
you
first
i
am
in
a
very
devoted
mood
this
morning
are
you
really
smiled
jeremy
because
i
am
so
is
baby
unfortunately
she
will
probably
want
to
give
you
something
horribly
expensive
between
ourselves
dear
i
shall
be
glad
when
baby
is
old
enough
to
buy
her
own
presents
for
her
mamma
last
christmas
her
idea
of
a
complete
edition
of
meredith
and
a
pair
of
brushes
nearly
ruined
me
you
wo
be
ruined
this
time
jeremy
i
do
want
you
to
give
me
anything
i
want
you
to
show
that
devotion
of
yours
by
something
for
me
anything
said
jeremy
grandly
shall
i
swim
the
channel
i
was
practising
my
new
trudgeon
stroke
in
the
bath
this
morning
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
prepared
to
give
an
exhibition
of
it
no
nothing
like
that
jeremy
hesitated
looked
anxiously
at
him
and
then
went
boldly
at
it
i
want
you
to
go
in
for
that
physical
culture
that
everyone
talking
about
who
everyone
cook
has
said
a
word
to
me
on
the
subject
neither
has
baby
neither
has
hodgkin
was
talking
to
me
about
it
yesterday
she
was
saying
how
thin
you
were
looking
the
scandal
that
goes
on
in
these
villages
sighed
jeremy
and
the
vicar
wife
too
dear
all
this
is
weeks
and
weeks
old
i
suppose
it
has
only
just
reached
the
vicarage
do
let
us
be
physical
culture
has
been
quite
since
last
thursday
well
never
saw
anything
in
the
paper
knowing
what
wives
are
i
hid
it
from
you
let
us
now
my
dear
wife
talk
of
something
else
jeremy
not
for
my
birthday
present
said
his
wife
in
a
reproachful
voice
the
vicar
does
them
every
morning
she
added
casually
poor
beggar
but
it
what
vicars
are
for
jeremy
chuckled
to
himself
i
should
love
to
see
him
he
said
i
suppose
it
private
though
perhaps
if
i
said
you
thin
you
know
my
dear
the
proper
way
to
get
fat
is
not
to
take
violent
exercise
but
to
lie
in
a
hammock
all
day
and
drink
milk
besides
do
you
want
a
fat
husband
does
baby
want
a
fat
father
you
would
like
at
your
next
garden
party
to
have
everybody
asking
you
in
a
whisper
is
the
enormously
stout
gentleman
if
nature
made
me
thin
or
to
be
more
accurate
slender
and
of
a
pleasing
litheness
let
us
believe
that
she
knew
best
it
is
only
thinness
these
exercises
keep
you
young
and
well
and
active
in
mind
like
the
vicar
he
only
just
begun
said
his
wife
hastily
let
wait
a
bit
and
watch
him
suggested
jeremy
if
his
sermons
really
get
better
then
i
think
about
it
seriously
i
make
you
a
present
of
his
baldness
i
sha
ask
for
any
improvement
there
jeremy
went
over
to
her
husband
and
patted
the
top
of
his
head
a
very
devoted
mood
this
morning
she
quoted
jeremy
looked
unhappy
what
pains
me
most
about
this
he
said
is
the
revelation
of
your
shortcomings
as
a
wife
you
ought
to
think
me
the
picture
of
manly
beauty
baby
does
she
thinks
that
next
to
the
postman
i
am
one
of
the
so
you
are
dear
well
why
not
leave
it
really
i
ca
waste
my
time
fattening
refined
gold
and
stoutening
the
lily
i
am
a
busy
man
i
walk
up
and
down
the
pergola
i
keep
a
dog
i
paint
little
i
am
treasurer
of
the
cricket
club
my
life
is
full
of
activities
this
only
takes
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
your
bath
jeremy
i
am
shaving
then
i
should
cut
myself
and
get
all
the
soap
in
my
eyes
it
would
be
most
dangerous
when
you
were
a
widow
and
baby
and
the
pony
were
orphans
you
and
hodgkin
would
be
sorry
but
it
would
be
too
late
the
vicar
tearing
himself
away
from
position
to
conduct
the
funeral
service
jeremy
ah
woman
now
i
move
you
you
are
beginning
to
see
what
you
were
in
danger
of
doing
death
i
laugh
at
but
a
fat
death
the
death
of
a
stout
man
who
has
swallowed
the
through
taking
too
deep
a
breath
before
beginning
exercise
that
is
more
than
i
can
bear
jeremy
when
i
said
i
wanted
to
kill
someone
for
you
i
did
think
you
would
suggest
myself
least
of
all
that
you
wanted
me
fattened
up
like
a
christmas
turkey
first
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
the
gentleman
who
inhaled
the
badger
hair
to
be
billed
in
the
london
press
in
the
words
fatal
accident
to
adipose
treasurer
to
do
this
simply
by
way
of
celebrating
your
birthday
when
we
actually
have
a
bottle
of
apollinaris
left
in
the
apollinaris
bin
darling
you
can
not
have
been
thinking
his
wife
patted
his
head
again
gently
oh
jeremy
you
hopeless
person
she
sighed
give
me
a
new
sunshade
i
want
one
badly
no
said
jeremy
baby
shall
give
you
that
for
myself
i
am
still
feeling
that
i
should
like
to
kill
somebody
for
you
lloyd
george
no
smith
he
rubbed
his
head
thoughtfully
who
invented
those
exercises
he
asked
suddenly
a
german
i
think
then
said
jeremy
buttoning
up
his
coat
i
shall
go
and
kill
one
of
our
sufferers
there
is
no
question
before
the
country
of
more
importance
than
that
of
national
health
in
my
own
small
way
i
have
made
something
of
a
study
of
it
and
when
a
royal
commission
begins
its
enquiries
i
shall
put
before
it
the
evidence
which
i
have
accumulated
i
shall
lay
particular
stress
upon
the
health
of
thomson
you
beat
me
he
said
as
he
swung
his
club
stiffly
on
the
first
tee
i
sha
be
able
to
hit
a
ball
you
should
have
some
lessons
i
suggested
thomson
gave
a
snort
of
indignation
it
not
he
said
but
i
been
very
seedy
lately
and
that
all
right
i
sha
mind
i
have
played
a
thoroughly
well
man
for
a
month
now
you
know
i
think
my
liver
i
held
up
my
hand
not
before
my
caddie
please
i
said
severely
he
is
quite
a
child
thomson
said
no
more
for
the
moment
but
hit
his
ball
hard
and
straight
along
the
ground
it
perfectly
absurd
he
said
with
a
shrug
i
sha
be
able
to
give
you
a
game
at
all
well
if
you
do
mind
playing
a
sick
man
not
if
you
do
mind
being
one
i
replied
and
drove
a
ball
which
also
went
along
the
ground
but
not
so
far
as
my
opponent
there
about
the
only
man
in
england
who
can
do
that
when
he
quite
well
the
ball
was
sitting
up
nicely
for
my
second
shot
and
i
managed
to
put
it
on
the
green
thomson
fifty
yards
farther
on
was
reclining
in
the
worst
part
of
a
bunker
which
he
had
forgotten
about
well
really
he
said
there
an
example
of
luck
for
you
ball
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
i
pleaded
do
be
angry
with
me
he
made
two
attempts
to
get
out
and
then
picked
his
ball
up
we
walked
in
silence
to
the
second
tee
this
time
i
said
i
shall
hit
the
sphere
properly
and
with
a
terrific
swing
i
stroked
it
gently
into
a
gorse
bush
i
looked
at
the
thing
in
disgust
and
then
felt
my
pulse
apparently
i
was
still
quite
well
thomson
forgetting
about
his
liver
drove
a
beauty
we
met
on
the
green
five
i
said
only
five
asked
thomson
suspiciously
six
i
said
holing
a
very
long
putt
thomson
health
had
a
relapse
he
took
four
short
putts
and
was
down
in
seven
it
really
rather
absurd
he
said
in
a
conversational
way
as
we
went
to
the
next
tee
that
putting
should
be
so
ridiculously
important
take
that
hole
for
instance
i
get
on
the
green
in
a
perfect
three
you
fluff
your
drive
completely
and
get
on
in
what
was
it
five
i
said
again
er
five
and
yet
you
win
the
hole
it
rather
absurd
is
it
i
often
thought
so
i
admitted
readily
that
is
to
say
when
taken
four
putts
i
two
up
on
the
third
tee
thomson
health
became
positively
alarming
he
missed
the
ball
altogether
it
ridiculous
to
try
to
play
he
said
with
a
forced
laugh
i
see
the
ball
at
all
it
still
there
i
assured
him
he
struck
at
it
again
and
it
hurried
off
into
a
ditch
look
here
he
said
would
you
rather
play
the
this
is
not
much
of
a
match
for
you
i
considered
of
course
a
game
with
the
pro
would
be
much
pleasanter
than
a
game
with
thomson
but
ought
i
to
leave
him
in
his
present
serious
condition
of
health
his
illness
was
approaching
its
critical
stage
and
it
was
my
duty
to
pull
him
through
if
i
could
no
no
i
said
let
go
on
the
fresh
air
will
do
you
good
perhaps
it
will
he
said
hopefully
i
sorry
i
like
this
but
had
a
cold
hanging
about
for
some
days
and
that
on
the
top
of
my
liver
quite
so
i
said
the
climax
was
reached
at
the
next
hole
when
with
several
strokes
in
hand
he
topped
his
approach
shot
into
a
bunker
for
my
sake
he
tried
to
look
as
though
he
had
to
run
it
up
along
the
ground
having
forgotten
about
the
intervening
hazard
it
was
a
brave
effort
to
hide
from
me
the
real
state
of
his
health
but
he
soon
saw
that
it
was
hopeless
he
sighed
and
pressed
his
hand
to
his
eyes
then
he
held
his
fingers
a
foot
away
from
him
and
looked
at
them
as
if
he
were
trying
to
count
them
correctly
his
state
was
pitiable
and
i
felt
that
at
any
cost
i
must
save
him
i
did
the
corner
was
turned
at
the
fifth
where
i
took
four
putts
you
are
going
to
win
the
holes
he
said
grudgingly
as
he
ran
down
his
putt
convalescence
set
in
at
the
sixth
when
i
got
into
an
impossible
place
and
picked
up
oh
well
i
shall
give
you
a
game
yet
he
said
two
down
the
need
for
further
bulletins
ceased
at
the
seventh
hole
which
he
played
really
well
and
won
easily
you
wo
beat
me
by
he
said
in
spite
of
my
liver
by
the
way
how
the
liver
i
asked
your
cure
is
doing
it
good
of
course
it
may
come
on
again
but
he
drove
a
screamer
i
think
i
shall
be
all
right
he
announced
all
square
he
said
cheerily
at
the
ninth
i
fancy
i
going
to
beat
you
now
not
bad
you
know
considering
you
were
four
up
practically
speaking
i
gave
you
a
start
of
four
holes
i
decided
that
it
was
time
to
make
an
effort
again
seeing
that
thomson
health
was
now
thoroughly
of
the
next
seven
holes
i
managed
to
win
three
and
halve
two
it
is
only
fair
to
say
though
as
thomson
did
several
times
that
i
had
an
extraordinary
amount
of
good
luck
and
that
he
was
dogged
by
throughout
but
this
after
all
is
as
nothing
so
long
as
one
health
is
above
suspicion
the
great
thing
was
that
thomson
liver
suffered
no
relapse
even
though
at
the
seventeenth
tee
he
was
one
down
and
two
to
play
and
it
was
on
the
seventeenth
tee
that
i
had
to
think
seriously
how
i
wanted
the
match
to
end
thomson
at
lunch
when
he
has
won
is
a
very
different
man
from
thomson
at
lunch
when
he
has
lost
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
i
realized
that
i
was
in
rather
a
happy
position
if
i
won
i
won
which
was
jolly
if
i
lost
thomson
won
and
we
should
have
a
pleasant
lunch
however
as
it
happened
the
match
was
halved
yes
i
was
afraid
so
said
thomson
i
let
you
get
too
long
a
start
it
absurd
to
suppose
that
i
can
give
you
four
holes
up
and
beat
you
it
practically
amounts
to
giving
you
four
bisques
four
bisques
is
about
six
strokes
i
not
really
six
strokes
better
than
you
what
about
lunch
i
suggested
good
and
you
can
have
your
revenge
afterwards
he
led
the
way
into
the
pavilion
now
i
wonder
he
said
what
i
can
safely
eat
i
want
to
be
able
to
give
you
sort
of
a
game
this
afternoon
well
if
there
is
ever
a
royal
commission
upon
the
national
physique
i
shall
insist
on
giving
evidence
for
it
seems
to
me
that
golf
far
from
improving
the
health
of
the
country
is
actually
undermining
it
thomson
at
any
rate
since
he
has
taken
to
the
game
has
never
been
quite
fit
in
the
swim
do
you
tango
asked
miss
hopkins
as
soon
as
we
were
comfortably
seated
i
know
her
name
was
hopkins
because
i
had
her
down
on
my
programme
as
popkins
which
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
and
in
order
to
give
her
a
chance
of
reconsidering
it
i
had
asked
her
if
she
was
one
of
the
popkinses
of
hampshire
it
had
then
turned
out
that
she
was
really
one
of
the
hopkinses
of
maida
vale
no
i
said
i
do
she
was
only
the
fifth
person
who
had
asked
me
but
then
she
was
only
my
fifth
partner
oh
you
ought
to
you
must
be
you
know
i
always
a
bit
late
with
these
things
i
explained
the
waltz
came
to
england
in
but
i
did
really
master
it
till
i
afraid
if
you
wait
as
long
as
that
before
you
master
the
tango
it
will
be
out
that
what
i
thought
by
the
time
i
learnt
the
tango
the
bingo
would
be
in
my
idea
was
to
learn
the
bingo
in
advance
so
as
to
be
ready
for
it
think
how
you
all
envy
me
in
think
how
society
will
flock
to
my
bingo
quick
lunches
i
shall
be
the
only
man
in
london
who
bingoes
properly
of
course
by
you
all
be
at
it
then
we
must
have
one
together
in
smiled
miss
hopkins
in
i
pointed
out
coldly
i
shall
be
learning
the
pongo
my
next
partner
had
no
name
that
i
could
discover
but
a
fund
of
conversation
do
you
tango
she
asked
me
as
soon
as
we
were
comfortably
seated
no
i
said
i
do
but
i
added
i
once
learned
the
minuet
oh
they
not
very
much
alike
are
they
not
a
bit
however
luckily
that
does
matter
because
i
forgotten
all
the
steps
now
she
seemed
a
little
puzzled
and
decided
to
change
the
subject
are
you
going
to
learn
the
tango
she
asked
i
do
think
so
it
took
me
four
months
to
learn
the
minuet
but
they
quite
different
are
they
quite
i
agreed
as
she
seemed
to
have
exhausted
herself
for
the
moment
it
was
obviously
my
business
to
say
something
there
was
only
one
thing
to
say
do
tango
i
asked
no
she
said
i
do
are
you
going
to
learn
oh
yes
ah
i
said
and
five
minutes
later
we
parted
for
ever
the
next
dance
really
was
a
tango
and
i
saw
to
my
horror
that
i
had
a
name
down
for
it
with
some
difficulty
i
found
the
owner
of
it
and
prepared
to
explain
to
her
that
unfortunately
i
could
dance
the
tango
but
that
for
profound
conversation
about
it
i
was
undoubtedly
the
man
luckily
she
explained
first
i
afraid
i
ca
do
this
she
apologised
i
so
sorry
not
at
all
i
said
magnanimously
we
sit
it
out
we
found
a
comfortable
seat
do
you
tango
she
asked
i
was
tired
of
saying
no
yes
i
said
are
you
sure
you
would
like
to
find
somebody
else
to
do
it
with
quite
thanks
the
fact
is
i
do
it
rather
differently
from
the
way
they
doing
it
here
you
see
i
actually
learnt
it
in
the
argentine
she
was
very
much
interested
to
hear
this
really
are
you
out
there
much
i
got
an
uncle
living
there
now
i
wonder
if
when
i
say
i
learnt
it
in
the
argentine
i
explained
i
mean
that
i
was
actually
taught
it
in
john
wood
but
that
my
dancing
mistress
came
from
in
john
wood
she
said
eagerly
but
how
funny
my
sister
is
learning
there
i
wonder
if
she
was
a
very
difficult
person
to
talk
to
her
relations
seemed
to
spread
themselves
all
over
the
place
perhaps
that
is
hardly
doing
justice
to
the
situation
i
explained
again
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
put
it
like
this
when
i
decided
by
the
way
does
your
family
frequent
paris
no
good
well
when
i
decided
to
learn
the
tango
the
fact
that
my
friends
the
hopkinses
of
john
wood
or
rather
maida
vale
had
already
learnt
it
in
paris
naturally
led
me
to
i
say
what
about
an
ice
getting
awfully
hot
in
here
oh
i
do
think
i
go
and
get
them
i
said
hastily
and
i
went
and
took
a
long
time
getting
them
and
as
it
turned
out
that
she
did
want
hers
after
all
a
longer
time
eating
them
when
i
was
ready
for
conversation
again
the
next
dance
was
beginning
with
a
bow
i
relinquished
her
to
another
come
along
said
a
bright
voice
behind
me
this
is
ours
hallo
norah
is
that
you
come
on
we
hurried
in
danced
in
silence
and
then
found
ourselves
a
comfortable
seat
for
a
moment
neither
of
us
spoke
have
you
learnt
the
tango
yet
asked
norah
fourteen
i
said
aloud
help
does
that
mean
that
i
the
fourteenth
person
who
has
asked
you
the
night
is
yet
young
norah
you
are
only
the
eighth
but
i
was
betting
that
you
ask
me
before
i
counted
twenty
you
lost
and
you
owe
me
a
pair
of
and
a
bother
anyhow
i
not
going
to
be
stopped
talking
about
the
tango
if
i
want
to
did
you
know
i
was
learning
i
can
do
the
scissors
good
we
do
the
new
fleet
street
movement
together
the
you
go
into
the
and
do
the
scissors
and
i
er
stick
here
and
do
the
paste
ca
you
really
do
any
of
it
at
all
and
are
you
going
to
learn
i
ca
do
any
of
it
at
all
norah
i
am
not
going
to
learn
norah
it
is
so
very
difficult
you
know
i
teach
you
myself
for
tuppence
will
you
stop
talking
about
it
for
threepence
i
asked
and
i
took
out
three
coppers
no
i
sighed
and
put
them
back
again
it
was
the
last
dance
of
the
evening
my
hostess
finding
me
lonely
had
dragged
me
up
to
somebody
and
i
and
whatever
her
name
was
were
in
the
drinking
our
farewell
soup
so
far
we
had
said
nothing
to
each
other
i
waited
anxiously
for
her
to
begin
suddenly
she
began
have
you
thought
about
christmas
presents
yet
she
asked
i
nearly
swooned
with
difficulty
i
remained
in
an
upright
position
she
was
the
first
person
who
had
not
begun
by
asking
me
if
i
danced
the
tango
excuse
me
i
said
i
afraid
i
did
would
you
tell
me
your
name
again
i
felt
that
it
ought
to
be
celebrated
in
some
way
i
had
some
notion
of
writing
a
sonnet
to
her
hopkins
she
said
i
knew
you
forgotten
me
of
course
i
have
i
said
suddenly
remembering
her
the
sonnet
would
never
be
written
now
we
had
a
dance
together
before
yes
she
said
let
me
see
she
added
i
did
ask
you
if
you
danced
the
tango
did
i
the
men
who
succeed
the
heir
trevor
pilkington
of
the
firm
of
trevor
pilkington
fixed
his
horn
spectacles
carefully
upon
his
nose
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
sneezed
twice
gave
his
papers
a
preliminary
rustle
looked
slowly
round
the
crowded
room
and
began
to
read
the
will
through
forty
years
of
his
method
of
procedure
had
always
been
the
same
but
jack
summers
who
was
sharing
an
ottoman
with
two
of
the
outdoor
servants
thought
that
pilkington
mannerisms
were
designed
specially
to
annoy
him
and
he
could
scarcely
control
his
impatience
yet
no
one
ever
had
less
to
hope
from
the
reading
of
a
will
than
jack
for
the
first
twenty
years
of
his
life
his
parents
had
brought
him
up
to
believe
that
his
cousin
cecil
was
heir
to
his
uncle
alfred
enormous
fortune
and
for
the
subsequent
ten
years
his
cousin
cecil
had
brought
his
uncle
alfred
up
in
the
same
belief
indeed
cecil
had
even
roughed
out
one
or
two
wills
for
signature
and
had
offered
to
help
his
uncle
who
however
preferred
to
do
these
things
by
himself
to
hold
the
pen
jack
could
not
help
feeling
glad
that
his
cousin
was
not
there
to
parade
his
approaching
triumph
a
nasty
cold
caught
a
week
previously
in
attending
his
uncle
to
the
lord
mayor
show
having
kept
cecil
in
bed
to
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
ten
shillings
and
sixpence
the
words
came
to
him
in
a
meaningless
drone
to
the
fresh
air
fund
ten
shillings
and
sixpence
to
the
king
edward
hospital
fund
ten
shillings
and
sixpence
was
the
money
going
in
charities
to
my
nephew
cecil
linley
who
has
taken
such
care
of
me
pilkington
hesitated
four
shillings
and
ninepence
to
my
nephew
john
summers
whom
thank
heaven
i
have
never
seen
five
million
pounds
a
long
whistle
of
astonishment
came
from
the
ottoman
the
solicitor
looked
up
with
a
frown
it
the
surprise
apologised
jack
i
hardly
expected
so
much
i
thought
that
that
brute
i
mean
i
thought
my
cousin
cecil
had
nobbled
that
is
to
say
was
getting
it
all
the
late
alfred
made
three
wills
said
the
lawyer
in
a
moment
of
expansion
in
the
first
he
left
his
nephew
cecil
a
legacy
of
one
shilling
and
tenpence
in
the
second
he
bequeathed
him
a
sum
of
three
shillings
and
twopence
and
in
the
last
he
set
aside
the
amount
of
four
shillings
and
ninepence
the
evidence
seems
to
show
that
your
cousin
was
rapidly
rising
in
his
uncle
estimation
you
on
the
other
hand
have
always
been
a
legatee
to
the
amount
of
five
million
pounds
but
in
the
last
will
there
is
a
trifling
condition
attached
he
resumed
his
papers
to
my
nephew
john
summers
five
million
pounds
on
condition
that
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
my
death
he
marries
mary
huggins
the
daughter
of
my
old
friend
now
deceased
william
huggins
jack
summers
rose
proudly
from
his
end
of
the
ottoman
thanks
he
said
curtly
that
tears
it
it
very
kind
of
the
old
gentleman
but
i
prefer
to
choose
a
wife
for
myself
he
bowed
to
the
company
and
strode
from
the
room
it
was
a
cloudless
august
day
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
elms
that
fringed
the
sussex
lane
a
girl
sat
musing
on
its
side
in
the
grass
at
her
feet
a
bicycle
its
back
wheel
deflated
she
sat
on
the
grassy
bank
with
her
hat
in
her
lap
quite
content
to
wait
until
the
first
with
a
repairing
outfit
in
his
pocket
should
offer
to
help
her
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
said
a
manly
voice
suddenly
waking
her
from
her
reverie
she
turned
with
a
start
the
owner
of
the
voice
was
dressed
in
a
stylish
knickerbocker
suit
his
eyes
were
blue
his
face
was
tanned
his
hair
was
curly
and
he
was
at
least
six
foot
tall
so
much
she
noticed
at
a
glance
my
bicycle
she
said
punctured
in
a
minute
he
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
machine
a
rapid
examination
convinced
him
that
she
had
not
the
truth
and
he
whipped
from
his
pocket
the
repairing
outfit
without
which
he
never
travelled
i
can
do
it
in
a
moment
he
said
at
least
if
you
can
just
help
me
a
little
as
she
knelt
beside
him
he
could
not
fail
to
be
aware
of
her
wonderful
beauty
the
repairs
somehow
took
longer
than
he
thought
their
heads
were
very
close
together
all
the
time
and
indeed
on
one
occasion
came
violently
into
contact
there
he
said
at
last
getting
up
and
barking
his
shin
against
the
pedal
conf
that
will
be
all
right
thank
you
she
said
tenderly
he
looked
at
her
without
disguising
his
admiration
a
tall
straight
figure
in
the
sunlight
its
right
shin
rubbing
itself
vigorously
against
its
left
calf
it
absurd
he
said
at
last
i
feel
as
if
i
known
you
for
years
and
anyway
i
certain
i
seen
you
before
somewhere
did
you
ever
go
to
seaside
she
asked
eagerly
often
do
you
remember
the
spanish
princess
who
came
on
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
and
said
to
the
mayor
why
of
course
and
you
had
your
photograph
in
and
sporting
and
all
in
the
same
week
the
girl
nodded
happily
yes
i
marie
huguenot
she
said
and
i
jack
summers
so
now
we
know
each
other
he
took
her
hand
marie
he
said
ever
since
i
have
mended
your
bicycle
i
mean
ever
since
i
have
known
you
i
have
loved
you
will
you
marry
me
jack
she
cooed
you
did
say
did
you
bless
you
marie
we
shall
be
very
poor
dear
will
you
mind
not
with
you
jack
at
least
not
if
you
mean
what
mean
by
poor
two
thousand
a
year
yes
that
about
what
i
meant
jack
took
her
in
his
arms
and
mary
huggins
can
go
and
marry
the
pope
he
said
with
a
smile
with
a
look
of
alarm
in
her
eyes
she
pushed
him
suddenly
away
from
her
there
was
a
crash
as
his
foot
went
through
the
front
wheel
of
the
bicycle
mary
huggins
she
cried
yes
i
was
left
a
fortune
on
condition
that
i
married
a
person
called
mary
huggins
absurd
as
though
how
much
oh
quite
a
lot
if
it
was
for
these
confounded
death
duties
five
million
pounds
you
see

cried
the
girl
do
you
understand
am
mary
huggins
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
you
said
your
name
was
marie
huguenot
he
said
slowly
my
stage
name
dear
naturally
i
could
i
mean
one
must
you
know
how
particular
managers
are
when
father
died
and
i
had
to
go
on
the
stage
for
a
living
marie
my
darling
mary
rose
and
picked
up
her
bicycle
the
air
had
gone
out
of
the
back
wheel
again
and
there
were
four
spokes
broken
but
she
did
not
heed
it
you
must
write
to
your
lawyer
she
said
he
be
surprised
but
being
a
great
reader
of
the
magazines
he
was
the
statesman
on
a
certain
night
in
the
middle
of
the
season
all
london
was
gathered
in
lady
marchpane
all
london
that
is
which
was
worth
knowing
a
qualification
which
accounted
for
the
absence
of
several
million
people
who
had
never
heard
of
lady
marchpane
in
one
corner
of
the
room
an
ambassador
with
a
few
ribbons
across
his
chest
could
have
been
seen
chatting
to
the
latest
american
duchess
in
another
corner
one
of
our
largest
advertisers
was
exchanging
epigrams
with
a
titled
newspaper
proprietor
famous
generals
rubbed
shoulders
with
artists
financiers
whispered
sweet
nothings
to
breeders
of
prize
poms
even
an
might
have
been
seen
accepting
an
apology
from
a
royalty
who
had
jostled
him
hallo
said
algy
lascelles
catching
sight
of
the
dignified
figure
of
rupert
meryton
in
the
crowd
how
william
a
rare
smile
lit
up
rupert
distinguished
features
he
was
under
secretary
for
invasion
affairs
and
william
was
algy
pleasant
way
of
referring
to
the
bill
which
he
was
now
piloting
through
the
house
of
commons
it
was
a
measure
for
doing
something
or
other
by
means
of
a
i
can
not
be
more
precise
without
precipitating
a
european
conflict
i
think
we
shall
get
it
through
said
rupert
calmly
lady
marchpane
was
talking
about
it
just
now
she
rather
interested
you
know
rupert
lips
closed
about
his
mouth
in
a
firm
line
he
looked
over
algy
head
into
the
crowd
oh
he
said
coldly
it
was
barely
ten
years
ago
that
young
meryton
just
down
from
oxford
had
startled
the
political
world
by
capturing
the
important
seat
of
cricklewood
for
the
tariffadicals
as
to
avoid
plunging
the
country
into
civil
war
i
must
call
them
this
was
at
a
and
the
liberatives
had
immediately
dissolved
only
to
come
into
power
after
the
general
election
with
an
increased
majority
through
the
years
that
followed
rupert
meryton
by
his
pertinacity
in
asking
the
invasion
secretary
questions
which
had
been
answered
by
him
on
the
previous
day
and
by
his
regard
for
the
dignity
of
the
house
as
shown
in
his
invariable
comment
come
come
not
quite
the
gentleman
upon
any
display
of
bad
manners
opposite
established
a
clear
right
to
a
post
in
the
subsequent
tariffadical
government
he
had
now
been
under
secretary
for
two
years
and
in
this
bill
his
first
real
chance
had
come
oh
there
you
are
meryton
said
a
voice
come
and
talk
to
me
a
moment
with
a
nod
to
a
couple
of
archbishops
lady
marchpane
led
the
way
to
a
little
gallery
whither
the
crowd
had
not
penetrated
priceless
correggios
tintorettos
and
chestertons
hung
upon
the
walls
but
it
was
not
to
show
him
these
that
she
had
come
dropping
into
a
wonderful
old
chippendale
chair
she
motioned
him
to
a
opposite
her
and
looked
at
him
with
a
curious
smile
well
she
said
about
the
bill
rupert
lips
closed
about
his
mouth
in
a
firm
line
he
was
rather
good
at
this
folding
his
arms
he
gazed
steadily
into
lady
still
beautiful
eyes
it
will
go
through
he
said
through
all
its
stages
he
added
professionally
it
must
not
go
through
said
lady
marchpane
gently
rupert
could
not
repress
a
start
but
he
was
master
of
himself
again
in
a
moment
i
can
not
add
anything
to
my
previous
statement
he
said
if
it
goes
through
began
lady
marchpane
i
must
refer
you
said
rupert
to
my
answer
of
yesterday
come
come
meryton
what
is
the
good
of
fencing
with
me
you
know
the
position
or
shall
i
state
it
for
you
again
i
can
not
believe
you
are
serious
i
am
perfectly
serious
there
are
reasons
financial
reasons
and
others
why
i
do
not
want
this
bill
to
pass
in
return
for
my
silence
upon
a
certain
matter
you
are
going
to
prevent
it
passing
you
know
to
what
i
refer
on
the
of
may
last
stop
cried
rupert
hoarsely
on
the
of
may
last
lady
marchpane
went
on
relentlessly
you
and
i
in
the
absence
of
my
husband
abroad
had
tea
together
at
an
rupert
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
am
no
fonder
of
scandal
than
you
are
but
if
you
do
not
meet
my
wishes
i
shall
certainly
confess
the
truth
to
marchpane
you
will
be
ruined
too
said
rupert
my
husband
will
forgive
me
and
take
me
back
she
paused
significantly
will
marjorie
hale
rupert
covered
his
hands
with
his
face
will
the
good
miss
hale
forgive
you
she
is
very
strict
is
she
not
and
rich
and
rising
young
politicians
want
money
more
than
scandal
she
raised
her
head
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
ah
archbishop
i
was
just
calling
meryton
attention
to
this
wonderful
botticell
she
looked
at
it
more
closely
this
wonderful
dana
gibson
a
beautiful
piece
of
work
is
it
not
the
intruders
passed
on
to
the
and
they
were
alone
again
what
am
i
to
do
said
rupert
sullenly
the
fate
of
the
bill
is
settled
week
when
you
make
your
big
speech
you
must
speak
against
it
confess
frankly
you
were
mistaken
it
will
be
a
close
thing
anyhow
your
influence
will
turn
the
scale
it
will
ruin
me
politically
you
will
marry
marjorie
hale
and
be
rich
no
rich
man
is
ever
ruined
politically
or
socially
she
patted
his
hand
gently
you
do
it
he
got
up
slowly
you
see
next
week
he
said
it
is
not
meet
that
we
should
watch
the
unhappy
rupert
through
the
hours
of
the
night
as
he
wrestled
with
the
terrible
problem
a
moment
sudden
madness
on
that
may
afternoon
had
brought
him
to
the
on
the
one
hand
reputation
wealth
the
girl
that
he
loved
on
the
other
his
own
honour
and
so
at
least
he
had
said
several
times
on
the
platform
the
safety
of
england
he
rose
in
the
morning
weary
but
with
his
mind
made
up
the
bill
should
go
through
rupert
meryton
was
a
speaker
of
a
not
unusual
type
although
he
provided
the
opinions
himself
he
always
depended
upon
his
secretary
for
the
arguments
with
which
to
support
them
and
the
actual
words
in
which
to
give
them
being
but
on
this
occasion
he
felt
that
a
special
effort
was
required
of
him
he
would
show
lady
marchpane
that
the
blackmail
of
yesterday
had
only
roused
him
to
a
still
greater
effort
on
behalf
of
his
country
would
write
his
own
on
the
fateful
night
the
house
was
crowded
it
seemed
that
all
the
guests
at
lady
marchpane
a
week
before
were
in
the
distinguished
strangers
gallery
or
behind
the
ladies
grille
from
the
press
gallery
our
special
looked
down
upon
the
statesmen
beneath
him
his
eagle
eye
ready
to
detect
on
the
moment
the
angry
flush
the
wince
or
the
sudden
paling
of
enemy
the
grim
smile
or
the
lofty
calm
of
friend
the
rt
hon
rupert
meryton
tariffadical
member
for
cricklewood
rose
to
his
feet
amidst
cheers
speaker
he
said
i
rise
er
sir
to
er
so
much
of
his
speech
i
may
give
but
urgent
state
reasons
compel
me
to
withhold
the
rest
were
it
ever
known
with
which
bill
the
secret
history
that
i
have
disclosed
concerns
itself
the
great
powers
in
an
instant
would
be
at
each
other
throats
but
though
i
may
not
disclose
the
speech
i
can
tell
of
its
effect
on
the
house
and
its
effect
was
curious
it
was
in
fact
the
exact
opposite
of
what
rupert
meryton
that
promising
under
secretary
had
intended
it
was
the
first
speech
that
he
had
ever
prepared
himself
than
rupert
there
was
no
more
dignified
figure
in
the
house
of
commons
his
honour
was
proof
as
we
have
seen
against
the
most
insidious
temptations
yet
since
one
man
can
not
have
all
the
virtues
he
was
distinctly
stupid
it
would
have
been
a
hopeless
speech
anyhow
but
to
make
matters
worse
he
had
in
the
most
important
part
of
it
attempted
irony
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
ironical
passage
even
the
tariffadical
had
to
confess
that
it
was
their
own
stalwarts
who
suddenly
paled
as
lady
marchpane
had
said
it
was
bound
to
be
a
close
thing
the
liberatives
and
the
unialists
of
course
were
solid
against
the
bill
but
there
was
also
something
of
a
cave
in
the
tariffadical
party
it
was
bound
to
be
a
close
thing
and
rupert
speech
just
made
the
difference
when
he
sat
down
the
waverers
and
doubters
had
made
up
their
minds
the
bill
was
defeated
that
the
tariffadicals
should
resign
was
natural
perhaps
it
was
equally
natural
that
rupert
secretary
should
resign
too
he
said
that
his
reputation
would
be
gone
if
rupert
made
any
more
speeches
on
his
own
and
that
he
was
going
to
risk
it
without
his
secretary
rupert
was
lost
at
the
general
election
which
followed
fortunately
he
had
a
grateful
friend
in
lady
marchpane
she
exerted
her
influence
with
the
liberatives
and
got
him
an
appointment
as
governor
of
the
stickjaw
islands
here
with
his
beautiful
and
rich
wife
sir
rupert
meryton
maintains
a
regal
state
and
upon
his
name
no
breath
of
scandal
rests
indeed
his
only
trouble
so
far
has
been
with
the
stickjaw
language
a
difficult
language
but
one
which
perhaps
fortunately
does
not
lend
itself
to
irony
the
magnate
it
was
in
october
that
the
word
zinc
first
began
to
be
heard
in
financial
circles
city
men
pushing
their
dominoes
regretfully
away
and
murmuring
zinc
in
apologetic
tones
were
back
in
their
offices
by
three
forgetting
in
their
haste
to
leave
the
usual
twopence
under
the
cup
for
the
waitress
clubmen
glancing
at
the
tape
on
their
way
to
the
said
to
their
neighbours
zinc
moved
a
point
i
see
before
covering
themselves
up
with
in
the
trains
returning
husbands
asked
each
other
loudly
what
all
this
about
zinc
all
save
the
very
innocent
ones
who
whispered
i
say
what
zinc
exactly
the
took
it
up
no
sooner
had
the
word
zinc
left
the
lips
of
an
acknowledged
comedian
than
the
house
was
in
roars
of
laughter
the
at
the
collodium
when
octavius
octo
in
his
part
of
the
landlady
of
a
remarked
i
know
why
my
ole
man
so
late
buying
zinc
is
still
remembered
in
the
bars
round
piccadilly
to
explain
it
properly
it
will
be
necessary
my
readers
will
be
alarmed
to
hear
to
go
back
some
thirty
years
this
as
a
simple
calculation
shows
takes
us
to
june
it
was
in
june
that
felix
moses
a
stout
young
man
of
attractive
appearance
if
you
care
for
that
style
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
and
told
phyllida
sloan
that
he
was
worth
ten
thousand
a
year
and
was
changing
his
name
to
mountenay
miss
sloan
seeing
that
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
proposal
said
hastily
that
she
was
changing
hers
to
abraham
you
marrying
leo
abraham
asked
felix
in
amazement
ah
a
gust
of
jealousy
swept
over
him
he
licked
his
lips
there
was
a
dangerous
look
in
his
eyes
a
look
that
was
destined
in
after
days
to
make
emperors
and
rival
financiers
quail
ah
he
said
softly
leo
abraham
i
shall
not
forget
and
now
it
will
be
necessary
my
readers
will
be
relieved
to
learn
to
jump
forward
some
thirty
years
this
obviously
takes
us
to
september
let
us
on
this
fine
september
morning
take
a
peep
into
no
throgneedle
street
and
see
how
the
business
of
the
mother
city
is
carried
on
on
the
fourth
floor
we
come
to
the
sanctum
of
the
great
man
himself
felix
mountenay
no
admittance
is
painted
upon
the
outer
door
it
is
a
name
which
is
known
and
feared
all
over
europe
private
detective
stands
on
one
side
of
the
door
on
the
other
side
is
mountenay
private
murmuring
the
word
press
however
we
pass
hastily
through
and
find
ourselves
before
mountenay
himself
mountenay
is
at
work
let
us
watch
him
through
a
typical
five
minutes
for
a
moment
he
stands
meditating
in
the
middle
of
the
room
kings
are
tottering
on
their
thrones
empires
hang
upon
his
nod
what
will
he
decide
suddenly
he
blows
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
cigar
and
rushes
to
the
telephone
hallo
is
that
you
jones
what
are
margarine
prefs
at
no
margarine
idiot
ah
then
sell
keep
on
selling
till
i
tell
you
to
stop
yes
he
hangs
up
the
receiver
for
two
minutes
he
paces
the
room
smoking
rapidly
he
stops
a
moment
but
it
is
only
to
remove
his
which
is
in
danger
of
burning
then
he
resumes
his
pacings
another
minute
goes
rapidly
by
he
rushes
to
the
telephone
again
hallo
is
that
you
jones
what
are
margarine
prefs
down
to
now
ah
then
buy
keep
on
buying
yes
he
hangs
up
the
receiver
by
this
he
has
made
a
quarter
of
a
million
it
may
seem
to
you
or
me
an
easy
way
of
doing
it
ah
but
what
we
must
ask
ourselves
of
the
great
brain
that
conceived
the
idea
the
foresight
which
told
the
exact
moment
when
to
put
it
into
action
the
cool
courage
which
seized
the
moment
what
of
the
grasp
of
affairs
the
knowledge
of
men
ah
can
we
grudge
it
him
that
he
earns
a
quarter
of
a
million
more
quickly
than
we
do
yet
felix
mountenay
is
not
happy
when
we
have
brought
off
a
coup
for
a
hundred
thousand
even
we
smile
gaily
mountenay
did
not
smile
fiercely
he
bit
another
inch
off
his
cigar
and
muttered
to
himself
the
words
were
leo
abraham
wait
this
is
positively
the
last
row
of
dots
let
us
take
advantage
of
them
to
jump
forward
another
month
it
was
october
if
that
was
a
sunday
then
it
was
october
anyhow
it
was
october
felix
mountenay
was
sleeping
in
his
office
for
once
that
iron
brain
relaxed
he
had
made
a
little
over
three
million
in
the
last
month
and
the
strain
was
too
much
for
him
but
a
knock
at
the
door
restored
him
instantly
to
his
own
cool
self
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
his
secretary
but
somebody
is
selling
zinc
the
word
zinc
touched
a
chord
in
mountenay
brain
which
had
lain
dormant
for
years
zinc
why
did
zinc
remind
him
of
leo
abraham
fetch
the
quick
he
cried
the
secretary
a
man
of
herculean
build
returned
with
some
of
it
with
the
luck
which
proverbially
attends
rich
men
mountenay
picked
up
the
z
volume
at
once
as
he
read
the
zinc
article
it
all
came
back
to
him
leo
abraham
had
owned
an
empty
was
his
enemy
in
his
clutches
at
last
buy
he
said
briefly
in
a
fortnight
the
secretary
had
returned
well
said
mountenay
have
you
bought
all
the
zinc
there
is
yes
sir
said
the
secretary
and
a
lot
that
there
is
he
added
good
he
paused
a
moment
when
leo
abraham
calls
he
added
grimly
show
him
up
at
once
it
was
a
month
later
that
a
haggard
man
climbed
the
stairs
of
no
throgneedle
street
and
was
shown
into
mountenay
room
well
said
the
financier
softly
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
want
some
zinc
said
leo
abergavenny
zinc
said
mountenay
with
a
smile
is
a
million
pounds
a
ton
or
an
acre
or
a
gallon
or
however
you
prefer
to
buy
it
he
added
humorously

said

and
told

and
she
said
that
she
was
changing

to
moses
naturally
i
thought
stop
cried
mountenay
he
sat
down
heavily
something
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
his
life
in
a
moment
the
world
was
empty
he
looked
up
at
his
old
rival
and
forced
a
laugh
well
well
he
said
she
deceived
us
both
let
us
drink
to
our
lucky
escape
he
rang
the
bell
and
then
he
said
in
a
purring
voice
we
can
have
a
little
talk
about
zinc
after
all
business
is
still
business
the
doctor
his
slippered
feet
stretched
out
luxuriously
to
the
fire
venables
of
mudford
lay
back
in
his
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
delights
of
his
flor
di
cabajo
no
a
box
of
which
had
been
presented
to
him
by
an
apparently
grateful
patient
it
had
been
a
busy
day
he
had
prescribed
more
than
half
a
dozen
hot
and
a
dozen
changes
of
air
he
had
promised
a
score
of
times
to
look
in
again
and
the
widow
nixey
had
told
him
yet
again
but
at
greater
length
than
before
her
private
opinion
of
doctors
sometimes
gordon
venables
wondered
whether
it
was
only
for
this
that
he
had
been
the
most
notable
student
of
his
year
at
bartholomew
his
brilliance
indeed
had
caused
something
of
a
sensation
in
medical
circles
and
a
remarkable
career
had
been
prophesied
for
him
it
was
venables
who
had
broken
up
one
suffrage
meeting
after
another
by
throwing
white
mice
at
the
women
on
the
platform
who
day
after
day
had
paraded
london
dressed
in
the
costume
of
a
brown
dog
until
arrested
for
biting
an
in
the
leg
no
wonder
that
all
the
prizes
of
the
profession
were
announced
to
be
within
his
grasp
and
that
when
he
buried
himself
in
the
little
country
town
of
mudford
he
was
thought
to
have
thrown
away
recklessly
opportunities
such
as
were
granted
to
few
he
had
been
in
mudford
for
five
years
now
an
occasional
paper
in
on
the
recurrence
of
in
kept
him
in
touch
with
modern
medical
thought
but
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
to
some
extent
his
powers
were
rusting
in
mudford
as
the
years
went
on
his
chance
of
harley
street
dwindled
come
in
he
said
in
answer
to
a
knock
at
the
door
the
housekeeper
head
appeared
there
been
an
accident
sir
she
gasped
gentleman
run
over
he
snatched
up
his
stethoscope
and
without
even
waiting
to
inquire
where
the
accident
was
hurried
into
the
night
something
whispered
to
him
that
his
chance
had
come
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
stopped
a
small
boy
hallo
johnny
he
said
breathlessly
where
the
accident
the
boy
looked
at
him
with
open
mouth
for
some
moments
then
he
had
an
idea
why
it
doctor
he
said
venables
pushed
him
over
and
ran
on
it
was
in
the
high
street
that
the
accident
had
happened
lord
lair
an
eccentric
old
gentleman
who
sometimes
walked
when
he
might
have
driven
had
while
dodging
a
been
run
into
by
a
child
hoop
he
lay
now
on
the
pavement
surrounded
by
a
large
and
interested
crowd
look
out
shouted
somebody
from
the
outskirts
here
comes
doctor
venables
pushed
his
way
through
to
his
patient
his
long
search
for
the
scene
of
the
accident
had
exhausted
him
bodily
but
his
mind
was
as
clear
as
ever
stand
back
there
he
said
in
an
authoritative
voice
then
taking
out
his
stethoscope
he
made
a
rapid
examination
of
his
patient
incised
wound
in
the
tibia
he
murmured
to
himself
slight
abrasion
of
the
patella
and
contusion
of
the
left
ankle
the
injuries
are
serious
but
not
necessarily
mortal
who
is
he
the
butcher
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
head
of
the
fallen
man
got
up
and
disclosed
the
features
of
lord
lair
venables
staggered
back
his
lordship
he
cried
he
is
a
patient
of
scott
i
have
attended
the
client
of
another
practitioner
professionally
i
am
ruined
lord
lair
who
was
now
breathing
more
easily
opened
his
eyes
take
me
home
he
groaned
venables
situation
was
a
terrible
one
medical
etiquette
demanded
his
immediate
retirement
from
the
case
but
the
promptings
of
humanity
and
the
thought
of
his
client
important
position
in
the
world
were
too
strong
for
him
throwing
his
scruples
to
the
winds
he
assisted
the
aged
peer
on
to
a
hastily
improvised
stretcher
and
accompanied
him
to
the
hall
his
lordship
once
in
bed
the
doctor
examined
him
again
it
was
obvious
immediately
that
there
was
only
one
hope
of
saving
the
patient
life
an
injection
of
must
be
given
without
loss
of
time
venables
took
off
his
coat
and
rolled
up
his
sleeves
he
never
travelled
without
a
small
bottle
of
this
serum
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
serum
which
as
my
readers
know
is
prepared
from
the
in
whose
body
fortunately
large
deposits
of
are
continually
found
with
help
from
a
footman
in
holding
down
the
patient
the
injection
was
made
in
less
than
a
year
lord
lair
was
restored
to
health
gordon
venables
case
came
before
the
british
medical
council
early
in
october
the
counts
in
the
indictment
were
two
the
first
was
that
on
the
of
june
last
gordon
venables
did
feloniously
and
with
malice
aforethought
commit
the
disgusting
and
infamous
crime
of
attending
professionally
the
client
of
another
practitioner
the
second
was
that
in
the
course
of
rendering
professional
services
to
the
said
client
venables
did
knowingly
and
wittingly
employ
the
assistance
of
one
who
was
not
a
properly
registered
medical
man
to
wit
thomas
boiling
footman
thereby
showing
himself
to
be
a
scurvy
fellow
of
infamous
morals
venables
decided
to
apologise
he
also
decided
to
send
in
an
account
to
lord
lair
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
he
justified
this
to
himself
mainly
on
the
ground
that
according
to
a
letter
in
that
the
supply
of
in
was
suddenly
giving
out
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
recoup
himself
for
the
generous
quantity
he
had
injected
into
lord
lair
naturally
also
he
felt
that
his
lordship
as
the
author
of
the
whole
trouble
owed
him
something
the
council
in
consideration
of
his
apology
dismissed
the
first
count
on
the
second
count
however
they
struck
him
off
the
register
it
was
a
terrible
position
for
a
young
doctor
to
be
in
but
gordon
venables
faced
it
like
a
man
with
lord
lair
fee
in
his
pocket
he
came
to
town
and
took
a
house
in
harley
street
when
he
had
paid
the
first
quarter
rent
and
the
first
instalment
on
the
hired
furniture
he
had
fifty
pounds
left
ten
pounds
he
spent
on
embossed
stationery
forty
pounds
he
spent
on
for
the
next
three
months
no
journal
was
complete
without
a
letter
from
harley
street
signed
gordon
venables
in
which
the
iniquity
of
his
treatment
by
the
british
medical
council
was
dwelt
upon
with
the
fervour
of
a
man
who
knew
his
subject
thoroughly
no
such
letter
was
complete
without
a
to
as
found
happily
in
and
the
treatment
as
recommended
by
peers
six
months
previously
the
name
of
venables
had
been
utterly
unknown
to
the
man
in
the
street
in
three
months
time
it
was
better
known
even
than
the
of
london
said
he
was
an
infamous
quack
the
other
half
of
london
said
he
was
a
martyred
genius
both
halves
agreed
that
after
all
one
might
as
well
this
new
treatment
just
to
see
if
there
was
anything
it
do
you
know
it
was
only
last
week
that
venables
made
an
excellent
speech
against
the
the
newspaper
proprietor
the
great
hector
strong
lord
of
journalism
and
swayer
of
empires
paced
the
floor
of
his
luxurious
apartment
with
bowed
head
his
corrugated
countenance
furrowed
with
lines
of
anxiety
he
had
just
returned
from
a
lunch
with
all
his
favourite
advertisers
but
it
was
not
this
which
troubled
him
he
was
thinking
out
a
new
policy
for
daily
suddenly
he
remembered
something
coming
up
to
town
in
his
third
motor
he
had
glanced
through
the
nineteen
periodicals
which
his
house
had
published
that
morning
and
in
one
case
had
noted
matter
for
serious
criticism
this
was
obviously
the
first
business
he
must
deal
with
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
pushed
the
bell
marked
instantly
a
footman
presented
himself
with
a
tray
of
sandwiches
what
do
you
want
said
strong
coldly
you
rang
for
me
sir
replied
the
trembling
menial
go
away
said
strong
recognizing
magnanimously
however
that
the
mistake
was
his
own
he
pressed
bell
in
another
moment
the
editor
of
was
before
him
in
number
said
strong
as
he
toyed
with
a
blue
pencil
you
apologize
for
a
mistake
in
last
week
number
he
waited
sternly
it
was
a
very
bad
mistake
sir
i
afraid
we
did
a
great
injustice
to
you
know
my
rule
said
strong
the
mistake
of
last
week
i
could
have
overlooked
the
apology
of
this
week
is
a
more
serious
matter
you
will
ask
for
a
month
salary
on
your
way
out
he
pressed
a
button
and
the
editor
disappeared
through
the
alone
again
hector
strong
thought
keenly
for
a
moment
then
he
pressed
bell
instantly
a
footman
presented
himself
with
a
tray
of
sandwiches
what
do
you
mean
by
this
roared
strong
his
iron
for
a
moment
giving
way
i
your
pardon
sir
stammered
the
man
i
get
out
as
the
footman
retired
strong
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
my
memory
is
bad
he
murmured
and
pushed
bell
a
tall
thin
man
entered
ah
good
afternoon
brownlow
said
the
proprietor
he
toyed
with
his
blue
pencil
let
me
see
which
of
our
papers
are
under
your
charge
at
the
moment
brownlow
reflected
just
now
he
said
i
am
editing

and
ah

want

to
take

for
a
little
while

and
moved

by
the
way

said

last
number

very
good

good
indeed
i
congratulate
you
good
day
left
alone
hector
strong
lord
of
journalism
and
swayer
of
empires
resumed
his
pacings
his
two
mistakes
with
the
bell
told
him
that
he
was
distinctly
not
himself
this
afternoon
was
it
only
the
need
of
a
new
policy
for
which
troubled
him
or
was
it
could
it
be
lady
dorothy
lady
dorothy
neal
was
something
of
an
enigma
to
hector
strong
he
was
making
more
than
a
million
pounds
a
year
and
yet
she
did
not
want
to
marry
him
sometimes
he
wondered
if
the
woman
were
quite
sane
yet
mad
or
sane
he
loved
her
a
secretary
knocked
and
entered
he
waited
submissively
for
half
an
hour
until
the
proprietor
looked
up
well
lady
dorothy
neal
would
like
to
see
you
for
a
moment
sir
show
her
in
lady
dorothy
came
in
brightly
what
men
you
have
here
she
said
who
is
the
one
in
the
blue
waistcoat
he
has
curly
hair
you
did
come
to
talk
about
said
hector
reproachfully
i
did
come
to
talk
him
really
but
if
you
keep
me
waiting
half
an
hour
why
what
are
you
doing
strong
looked
up
from
the
note
he
was
writing
the
tender
lines
had
gone
from
his
face
and
he
had
become
the
stern
man
of
action
again
i
am
giving
instructions
that
the
services
of
my
commissionaire
and
fifth
secretary
will
no
longer
be
required
do
do
that
pleaded
dorothy
strong
tore
up
the
note
and
turned
to
her
what
do
you
want
of
me
he
asked
she
blushed
and
looked
down
i
i
have
written
a
a
play
she
faltered
he
smiled
indulgently
he
did
not
write
plays
himself
but
he
knew
that
other
people
did
when
does
it
come
off
he
asked
the
manager
says
it
will
have
to
at
the
end
of
the
week
it
came
a
week
ago
well
he
smiled
if
people
do
want
to
go
i
ca
make
them
yes
you
can
she
said
boldly
he
gave
a
start
his
brain
working
at
lightning
speed
saw
the
possibilities
in
an
instant
at
one
stroke
he
could
win
lady
gratitude
provide
daily
with
a
temporary
policy
and
give
a
convincing
exhibition
of
the
power
of
his
press
oh
strong
hector
he
whispered
as
he
rose
from
his
desk
to
go
to
her
he
accidentally
pressed
the
button
of
the
the
next
moment
he
was
alone
that
the
british
public
is
always
ready
to
welcome
the
advent
of
a
clean
and
wholesome
play
is
shown
by
the
startling
success
of
which
is
attracting
such
crowds

the

continued
in
the

a
column

keenly
exercised
wrote
evening
over
a
problem
of
etiquette
which
arises
in
the
second
act
of
the
great
autumn
success
at
the
king
theatre
the
point
is
shortly
this
should
a
woman
and
so
on
a
pretty
little
story
is
going
the
rounds
said
anent
that
charming
little
lady
estelle
rito
who
plays
the
part
of
a
governess
in
for
which
barodo
informs
me
advance
booking
up
to
christmas
has
already
been
taken
it
seems
that
miss
rito
when
shopping
in
the
purlieus
of
bond
street
had
a
joke
which
set
all
the
world
laughing
it
was
called
between
the
acts
the
lady
in
the
box
with
mr
johnson
it
his
wife
and
flossie
giggled
so
much
that
she
could
hardly
listen
to
the
last
act
of
which
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
for
weeks
sunday
offered
free
tickets
to
a
hundred
unmarried
suburban
girls
to
which
class
might
be
supposed
to
make
a
special
religious
appeal
but
they
had
to
collect
coupons
first
for
sunday
and
finally
of
two
months
later
said
a
marriage
has
been
arranged
between
lady
dorothy
neal
daughter
of
the
earl
of
skye
and
the
hon
geoffrey
bollinger
than
a
successful
revenge
nothing
is
sweeter
in
life
hector
strong
was
not
the
man
to
spare
anyone
who
had
done
him
an
injury
yet
i
think
his
method
of
revenging
himself
upon
lady
dorothy
savoured
of
the
diabolical
he
printed
a
photograph
of
her
in
daily
picture
it
was
headed
the
beautiful
lady
dorothy

when
peter
plimsoll

parting

to
his
sons
to
stick
to
the
business

followed
only
by
john
the
elder
adrian
the
younger
had
a
soul
above
adhesion
he
disposed
of
his
share
in
the
concern
and
settled
down
to
follow
the
life
of
a
gentleman
of
taste
and
culture
and
more
particularly
patron
of
the
arts
he
began
in
a
modest
way
to
collect
his
range
at
first
was
catholic
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
acquired
a
hundred
and
of
various
designs
that
he
decided
to
make
a
speciality
of
historic
ones
this
decision
was
hastened
by
the
discovery
that
one
of
queen
inkstands
supposed
by
the
owner
to
be
the
identical
one
with
whose
aid
she
wrote
her
last
letter
to
raleigh
was
about
to
be
put
on
the
market
at
some
expense
adrian
obtained
an
introduction
through
a
third
party
to
the
owner
at
more
expense
the
owner
obtained
through
the
same
gentleman
an
introduction
to
adrian
and
in
less
than
a
month
the
great
elizabeth
was
safely
established
in
adrian
house
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
plimsoll
collection
this
was
twenty
years
ago

that
i
shall
only
have
time
to
point
out
a
few
of
the
choicest
gems
this
is
a
pontesiori
sword
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
only
example
of
the
master
art
without
any
notches
on
the
left
is
a
capricci
if
you
have
never
heard
of
capricci
you
ought
to
come
to
a
house
like
this
here
we
have
before
us
the
historic
de
montigny
topaz
ask
your
little
boy
to
tell
you
about
it
in
the
east
gallery
of
course
the
chief
treasure
is
the
santo
di
santo
amulet
described
so
minutely
in
his
by
john
of
flanders
the
original
of
this
book
is
in
the
south
gallery
you
must
glance
at
it
when
we
get
there
it
will
save
you
the
trouble
of
ordering
a
copy
from
your
library
they
would
be
sure
to
keep
you
waiting
with
some
such
words
as
these
i
lead
my
friends
round
number
fifteen
the
many
treasures
in
the
private
parts
of
the
house
i
may
not
show
of
course
the
bathroom
for
instance
in
which
hangs
the
finest
collection
of
portraits
of
philatelists
that
europe
can
boast
you
must
spend
a
night
with
adrian
to
be
admitted
to
their
company
and
as
one
of
the
elect
i
can
assure
you
that
nothing
can
be
more
stimulating
on
a
winter
morning
than
to
catch
the
eye
of
frisby
dranger
behind
the
taps
as
your
head
first
emerges
from
the
icy
waters
adrian
plimsoll
sat
at
breakfast
sipping
his
hot
water
and
crumbling
a
dry
biscuit
a
light
was
in
his
eye
a
flush
upon
his
pallid
countenance
he
had
just
heard
from
a
trusty
agent
that
the
scutori
had
been
seen
in
devonshire
his
car
was
ready
to
take
him
to
the
station
but
alas
a
disappointment
awaited
him
on
close
examination
the
turned
out
to
be
a
common
risoldo
of
inferior
working
adrian
left
the
house
in
disgust
and
started
on
his
walk
back
to
the
station
to
complete
his
misery
a
sudden
storm
came
on
cursing
alternately
his
agent
and
risoldo
he
made
his
way
to
a
cottage
and
asked
for
shelter
an
old
woman
greeted
him
civilly
and
bade
him
come
in
if
i
may
just
wait
till
the
storm
is
over
said
adrian
and
he
sat
down
in
her
parlour
and
looked
appraisingly
as
was
his
habit
round
the
room
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
corner
was
genuine
but
he
was
beyond
grandfather
clocks
there
was
nothing
else
of
any
value
three
china
dogs
and
some
odd
trinkets
on
the
a
print
or
two
stay
what
was
that
behind
the
youngest
dog
may
i
look
at
that
old
bracelet
he
asked
his
voice
trembling
a
little
and
without
waiting
for
permission
he
walked
over
and
took
up
the
circle
of
tarnished
metal
in
his
hands
as
he
examined
it
his
colour
came
and
went
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
with
a
tremendous
effort
he
composed
himself
and
returned
to
his
chair
was
the
emperor
bracelet
of
course
you
know
the
history
of
this
most
famous
of
all
bracelets
made
by
spurius
quintus
of
rome
in
it
was
given
by
cæsar
to
cleopatra
who
tried
without
success
to
dissolve
it
in
vinegar
returning
to
rome
by
way
of
antony
it
was
worn
at
a
minor
conflagration
by
nero
after
which
it
was
lost
sight
of
for
many
centuries
it
was
eventually
heard
of
during
the
reign
of
canute
or
knut
as
his
admirers
called
him
and
john
is
known
to
have
lost
it
in
the
wash
whence
it
was
recovered
a
century
afterwards
it
must
have
travelled
thence
to
france
for
it
was
seen
once
in
the
possession
of
louis
xi
and
from
there
to
spain
for
philip
the
handsome
presented
it
to
joanna
on
her
wedding
day
columbus
took
it
to
america
but
fortunately
brought
it
back
again
peter
the
great
threw
it
at
an
indifferent
musician
on
one
of
its
later
visits
to
england
pope
wrote
a
couplet
to
it
and
the
most
astonishing
thing
in
its
whole
history
was
that
now
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
it
had
vanished
completely
to
turn
up
again
in
a
little
devonshire
cottage
verily
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
that
rather
a
curious
bracelet
of
yours
said
adrian
casually
my
er
wife
has
one
just
like
it
which
she
asked
me
to
match
is
it
an
old
friend
or
would
you
care
to
sell
it
my
mother
gave
it
me
said
the
old
woman
and
she
had
it
from
hers
i
do
know
no
further
than
that
i
did
mean
to
sell
it
but
quite
right
said
adrian
and
after
all
i
can
easily
get
another
but
i
wo
say
a
bit
of
money
would
be
useful
what
would
you
think
a
fair
price
sir
five
shillings
adrian
heart
jumped
to
get
the
emperor
bracelet
for
five
shillings
but
the
spirit
of
the
collector
rose
up
strong
within
him
he
laughed
kindly
my
good
woman
he
said
they
turn
out
bracelets
like
that
in
birmingham
at
two
shillings
apiece
and
quite
new
i
give
you
tenpence
make
it
she
pleaded
times
are
hard
adrian
reflected
he
was
not
strictly
speaking
impoverished
he
could
afford
he
said
no
no
she
repeated
obstinately
adrian
reflected
again
after
all
he
could
always
sell
it
for
ten
thousand
pounds
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
well
well
he
sighed
let
it
be
he
counted
out
the
money
carefully
then
putting
the
precious
bracelet
in
his
pocket
he
rose
to
go
adrian
has
no
relations
living
now
when
he
dies
he
proposes
to
leave
the
plimsoll
collection
to
the
nation
having
as
far
as
he
can
foresee
no
particular
use
for
it
in
the
next
world
this
is
really
very
generous
of
him
and
no
doubt
when
the
time
comes
the
papers
will
say
so
but
it
is
a
pity
that
he
can
not
be
appreciated
properly
in
his
lifetime
personally
i
should
like
to
see
him
knighted
the
adventurer
lionel
norwood
from
his
earliest
days
had
been
marked
out
for
a
life
of
crime
when
quite
a
child
he
was
discovered
by
his
nurse
killing
flies
on
the
this
was
before
the
character
of
the
had
become
a
matter
of
common
talk
among
scientists
and
lionel
like
all
great
men
a
little
before
his
time
had
pleaded
hygiene
in
vain
he
was
smacked
hastily
and
bundled
off
to
a
preparatory
school
where
his
aptitude
for
smuggling
sweets
would
have
lost
him
many
a
had
not
his
services
been
required
at
in
the
hockey
eleven
with
some
difficulty
he
managed
to
pass
into
eton
and
three
years
later
with
one
would
imagine
still
more
difficulty
managed
to
get
superannuated
at
cambridge
he
went
rapidly
he
would
think
nothing
of
smoking
a
cigar
in
academical
costume
and
on
at
least
one
occasion
he
drove
a
dogcart
on
sunday
no
wonder
that
he
was
requested
early
in
his
second
year
to
give
up
his
struggle
with
the
and
betake
himself
back
to
london
london
is
always
glad
to
welcome
such
people
as
lionel
norwood
in
no
other
city
is
it
so
simple
for
a
man
of
easy
conscience
to
earn
a
living
by
his
wits
if
lionel
ever
had
any
scruples
which
after
a
perusal
of
the
above
account
of
his
early
days
it
may
be
permitted
one
to
doubt
they
were
removed
by
an
accident
to
his
solicitor
who
was
run
over
in
the
argentine
on
the
very
day
that
he
arrived
there
with
what
was
left
of
lionel
money
reduced
suddenly
to
poverty
norwood
had
no
choice
but
to
enter
upon
a
life
of
crime
except
perhaps
that
he
used
slightly
less
than
most
he
seemed
just
the
ordinary
man
about
town
as
he
sat
in
his
one
fine
summer
morning
and
smoked
a
cigarette
his
rooms
were
furnished
quietly
and
in
the
best
of
taste
no
signs
of
his
nefarious
profession
showed
themselves
to
the
casual
visitor
the
appealing
letters
from
the
princess
whom
he
was
blackmailing
the
wire
apparatus
which
shot
the
two
of
spades
down
his
sleeve
during
the
nights
at
the
club
the
thimble
and
pea
with
which
he
had
performed
the
trick
so
successfully
at
epsom
last
week
all
these
were
hidden
away
from
the
common
gaze
it
was
a
young
gentleman
of
fashion
who
lounged
in
his
chair
and
toyed
with
a
priceless
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
masters
his
confidential
valet
came
in
well
said
lionel
have
you
looked
through
the
post
yes
sir
said
the
man
there
the
usual
cheque
from
her
highness
a
request
for
more
time
from
the
lady
in
tite
street
with
twopence
to
pay
on
the
envelope
and
banknotes
from
the
professor
as
expected
the
young
gentleman
of
hill
street
has
gone
abroad
suddenly
sir
ah
said
lionel
with
a
sudden
frown
i
suppose
you
better
cross
him
off
our
list
masters
yes
sir
i
had
ventured
to
do
so
sir
i
think
that
all
except
that
snooks
is
glad
to
accept
your
kind
invitation
to
dinner
and
bridge
will
you
wear
the
coat
sir
or
the
metal
clip
lionel
made
no
answer
he
sat
plunged
in
thought
when
he
spoke
it
was
about
another
matter
masters
he
said
i
have
found
out
lord
fairlie
secret
at
last
i
shall
go
to
see
him
this
afternoon
yes
sir
will
you
wear
your
revolver
sir
as
it
a
first
call
i
think
so
if
this
comes
off
masters
it
will
make
our
fortune
i
hope
so
i
sure
sir
masters
placed
the
whisky
within
reach
and
left
the
room
silently
alone
lionel
picked
up
his
paper
and
turned
to
the
agony
column
as
everybody
knows
the
agony
column
of
a
daily
paper
is
not
actually
so
domestic
as
it
seems
when
mother
apparently
says
to
floss
come
home
at
once
father
gone
away
for
week
bert
and
sid
longing
to
see
you
what
is
really
happening
is
that
barney
hoker
is
telling
jud
batson
to
meet
him
outside
the
duke
of
westminster
little
place
at
precisely
on
tuesday
morning
not
forgetting
to
bring
his
jemmy
and
a
dark
lantern
with
him
and
floss
announcement
next
day
coming
home
with
george
is
jud
way
of
saying
that
he
will
turn
up
all
right
and
half
thinks
of
bringing
his
automatic
pistol
with
him
too
in
case
of
accidents
in
this
language
which
of
course
takes
some
little
learning
lionel
norwood
had
long
been
an
expert
the
advertisement
which
he
was
now
reading
was
unusually
elaborate
lost
in
a
taxi
between
baker
street
and
shepherd
bush
a
umbrella
with
initials
on
it
if
ellen
will
return
to
her
father
immediately
all
will
be
forgiven
white
spot
on
foreleg
mother
very
anxious
and
desires
to
return
thanks
for
kind
enquiries
answers
to
the
name
of
ponto
dat
qui
cito
what
did
it
mean
for
lionel
it
had
no
secrets
he
was
reading
the
revelation
by
one
of
his
agents
of
the
skeleton
in
lord
cupboard
lord
fairlie
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
members
of
the
cabinet
his
vein
of
high
seriousness
his
lofty
demeanour
the
sincerity
of
his
manner
endeared
him
not
only
to
his
own
party
but
even
astounding
as
it
may
seem
to
a
few
men
upon
the
other
side
who
admitted
in
moments
of
expansion
which
they
probably
regretted
afterwards
that
he
might
after
all
be
as
devoted
to
his
country
as
they
were
for
years
now
his
life
had
been
without
blemish
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
even
in
his
youth
he
could
have
sown
any
wild
oats
terrible
to
think
that
these
wild
oats
might
now
be
coming
home
to
roost
what
do
you
require
of
me
he
said
courteously
to
lionel
as
the
latter
was
shown
into
his
study
lionel
went
to
the
point
at
once
i
am
here
my
lord
he
said
on
business
in
the
course
of
my
ordinary
avocations
the
parliamentary
atmosphere
seemed
to
be
affecting
his
language
i
ascertained
a
certain
secret
in
your
past
life
which
if
it
were
revealed
might
conceivably
have
a
not
undamaging
effect
upon
your
career
for
my
silence
in
this
matter
i
must
demand
a
sum
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
lord
fairlie
had
grown
paler
and
paler
as
this
speech
proceeded
what
have
you
discovered
he
whispered
alas
he
knew
only
too
well
what
the
damning
answer
would
be
years
said
lionel
wrote
a
humorous
lord
fairlie
gave
a
strangled
cry
his
keen
mind
recognized
in
a
flash
what
a
hold
this
knowledge
would
give
his
enemies
of
his
book
had
been
called
already
he
saw
the
leading
articles
of
the
future
we
confess
ourselves
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
lord
fairlie
speech
at
plymouth
yesterday
was
intended
as
a
supplement
to
his
earlier
work
of
or
as
a
serious
offering
to
a
nation
impatient
of
levity
in
such
a
crisis
the
cabinet
jester
in
whom
twenty
years
ago
the
country
lost
an
excellent
clown
without
gaining
a
statesman
was
in
great
form
last
night
lord
fairlie
has
amused
us
in
the
past
with
his
clever
little
parodies
he
may
amuse
us
in
the
future
but
as
a
statesman
we
can
only
view
him
with
disgust
well
said
lionel
at
last
i
think
your
lordship
is
wise
enough
to
understand
the
discovery
of
a
sense
of
humour
in
a
man
of
your
eminence
but
lord
fairlie
was
already
writing
out
the
cheque
the
explorer
as
the
evening
wore
on
and
one
young
man
after
another
asked
jocelyn
montrevor
if
she
were
going
to
ascot
what
or
to
henley
what
or
what
she
wondered
more
and
more
if
this
were
all
that
life
would
ever
hold
for
her
would
she
never
meet
a
man
a
real
man
who
had
something
these
boys
around
her
were
very
pleasant
she
admitted
to
herself
very
useful
indeed
she
added
as
one
approached
her
with
some
refreshment
but
they
were
only
boys
here
you
are
said
freddy
handing
her
an
ice
in
three
colours
had
it
made
specially
cold
for
you
they
only
had
the
green
pink
and
yellow
jerseys
left
i
hope
you
do
mind
the
green
part
is
arsenic
i
believe
if
you
do
want
the
wafer
i
take
it
home
and
put
it
between
the
sashes
of
my
bedroom
window
the
rattling
kept
me
awake
all
last
night
that
why
i
looking
so
ill
by
the
way
jocelyn
smiled
kindly
and
went
on
with
her
ice
that
reminds
me
freddy
went
on
we
got
a
nut
here
the
genuine
thing
none
of
your
society
barcelonas
or
suburban
filberts
one
of
the
real
cob
family
the
and
touch
in
short
a
celebrity
who
asked
jocelyn
eagerly
perhaps
here
was
a
man
worrall
brice
the
explorer
do
say
you
have
heard
of
him
or
aunt
alice
will
cry
heard
of
him
of
course
she
had
heard
of
him
who
had
worrall
brice
adventures
in
distant
parts
of
the
empire
would
have
filled
a
book
had
in
fact
already
filled
three
a
glance
at
his
flat
in
james
street
gave
you
some
idea
of
the
adventures
he
had
been
through
here
were
the
polished
spurs
of
his
companion
in
the
famous
ride
through
australia
from
south
to
north
all
that
had
been
left
by
the
cannibals
of
the
river
after
their
banquet
here
was
the
poisoned
arrow
which
by
the
merciful
intervention
of
providence
just
missed
worrall
and
pierced
the
heart
of
one
of
his
black
attendants
the
happily
revealing
the
presence
of
a
new
and
interesting
poison
here
again
was
the
rope
with
which
he
was
hanged
by
mistake
as
a
spy
in
south
america
a
mistake
which
would
certainly
have
had
fatal
results
if
he
had
not
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
hold
his
breath
during
the
performance
in
yet
another
corner
you
might
see
his
favourite
mascot
a
tooth
of
the
shark
which
bit
him
off
the
coast
of
china
spears
knives
and
guns
lined
the
walls
every
inch
of
the
floor
was
covered
by
skins
his
flat
was
typical
of
the
man
a
man
who
had
things
introduce
him
to
me
commanded
jocelyn
where
is
he
she
looked
up
suddenly
and
saw
him
entering
the
he
was
of
commanding
height
and
his
face
was
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
been
exposed
to
the
forces
of
nature
the
wind
the
waves
the
sun
the
mosquito
had
set
their
mark
upon
him
down
one
side
of
his
cheek
was
a
newly
healed
scar
a
scratch
from
a
hippopotamus
in
its
last
a
legacy
from
a
bison
seared
his
brow
he
walked
with
the
soft
easy
tread
of
the
python
or
the
pathan
or
some
animal
with
a
pth
in
it
probably
i
mean
the
panther
he
bore
himself
confidently
and
his
mouth
was
a
trap
from
which
no
superfluous
word
escaped
he
was
the
strong
silent
man
of
jocelyn
dreams
worrall
brice
miss
montrevor
said
freddy
and
left
them
worrall
brice
bowed
and
stood
beside
her
with
folded
arms
his
gaze
fixed
above
her
head
i
shall
not
expect
you
to
dance
said
jocelyn
with
a
confidential
smile
which
implied
that
he
and
she
were
above
such
frivolities
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
could
have
taught
her
the
the
bimbo
the
kiyi
the
the
hug
and
many
other
cannibalistic
steps
which
later
on
were
to
become
the
rage
of
london
and
the
basis
of
a
i
have
often
imagined
you
as
you
kept
watch
over
your
camp
she
went
on
and
i
have
seemed
myself
to
hear
the
savages
and
lions
roaring
outside
the
circle
of
fire
what
time
in
the
swamps
the
crocodiles
were
barking
yes
he
said
it
must
be
a
wonderful
life
yes
if
i
were
a
man
i
should
want
to
lead
such
a
life
to
get
away
from
all
this
and
she
waved
her
hand
round
the
room
back
to
nature
to
know
that
i
could
not
eat
until
i
had
first
killed
my
dinner
that
i
could
not
live
unless
i
slew
the
enemy
that
must
be
fine
yes
said
worrall
i
can
not
get
freddy
to
see
it
he
is
quite
content
to
have
shot
a
few
grouse
and
once
to
have
wounded
a
beater
there
must
be
more
in
life
than
that
yes
i
suppose
i
am
elemental
beneath
the
veneer
of
civilization
i
am
a
savage
to
wake
up
with
the
of
the
enemy
in
my
ears
to
sleep
with
the
er
barking
of
the
crocodile
in
my
dreams
that
is
life
worrall
brice
tugged
at
his
moustache
and
gazed
into
space
over
her
head
then
he
spoke
crocodiles
do
bark
he
said
jocelyn
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
but
in
your
book
trackless
she
cried
i
know
it
almost
by
heart
it
was
you
who
taught
me
what
are
the
beautiful
words
the
banks
of
the
sleepy
river
two
great
crocodiles
were
barking
not
said
worrall
it
was
a
misprint
oh
said
jocelyn
she
had
a
moment
awful
memory
of
all
the
occasions
when
she
had
insisted
that
crocodiles
barked
there
had
been
a
particularly
fierce
argument
with
meta
richards
who
had
refused
to
weigh
even
the
printed
word
of
worrall
brice
against
the
silence
of
the
reptile
house
on
her
last
visit
to
the
zoo
well
smiled
jocelyn
you
must
teach
me
about
these
things
will
you
come
and
see
me
yes
said
worrall
he
rather
liked
to
stand
and
gaze
into
the
distance
while
pretty
women
talked
to
him
and
jocelyn
was
very
pretty
we
live
in
south
kensington
come
on
sunday
wo
you
peele
crescent
yes
said
worrall
on
sunday
jocelyn
waited
eagerly
for
him
in
the
of
peele
crescent
her
father
was
asleep
in
the
library
her
mother
was
dead
so
she
would
have
the
great
man
to
herself
for
an
afternoon
later
she
would
have
him
for
always
for
she
meant
to
marry
him
and
when
they
were
married
she
was
not
so
sure
that
they
would
live
with
the
noise
of
the
crocodile
barking
or
coughing
or
whatever
it
did
in
their
ears
she
saw
herself
in
that
little
house
in
green
street
with
the
noise
of
and
to
soothe
her
to
sleep
yet
what
a
man
he
was
what
had
he
said
to
her
she
went
over
all
his
words
they
were
not
many

six

was
still
waiting
in
the
at
peele

taxi
and

traveller
but
south
kensington
