preface
this
book
is
in
three
parts
the
first
two
miss
keller
story
and
the
extracts
from
her
letters
form
a
complete
account
of
her
life
as
far
as
she
can
give
it
much
of
her
education
she
can
not
explain
herself
and
since
a
knowledge
of
that
is
necessary
to
an
understanding
of
what
she
has
written
it
was
thought
best
to
supplement
her
autobiography
with
the
reports
and
letters
of
her
teacher
miss
anne
mansfield
sullivan
the
addition
of
a
further
account
of
miss
keller
personality
and
achievements
may
be
unnecessary
yet
it
will
help
to
make
clear
some
of
the
traits
of
her
character
and
the
nature
of
the
work
which
she
and
her
teacher
have
done
for
the
third
part
of
the
book
the
editor
is
responsible
though
all
that
is
valid
in
it
he
owes
to
authentic
records
and
to
the
advice
of
miss
sullivan
the
editor
desires
to
express
his
gratitude
and
the
gratitude
of

i
it
is
with
a
kind
of
fear
that
i
begin
to
write
the
history
of
my
life
i
have
as
it
were
a
superstitious
hesitation
in
lifting
the
veil
that
clings
about
my
childhood
like
a
golden
mist
the
task
of
writing
an
autobiography
is
a
difficult
one
when
i
try
to
classify
my
earliest
impressions
i
find
that
fact
and
fancy
look
alike
across
the
years
that
link
the
past
with
the
present
the
woman
paints
the
child
experiences
in
her
own
fantasy
a
few
impressions
stand
out
vividly
from
the
first
years
of
my
life
but
the
shadows
of
the
are
on
the
rest
besides
many
of
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
childhood
have
lost
their
poignancy
and
many
incidents
of
vital
importance
in
my
early
education
have
been
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
great
discoveries
in
order
therefore
not
to
be
tedious
i
shall
try
to
present
in
a
series
of
sketches
only
the
episodes
that
seem
to
me
to
be
the
most
interesting
and
important
i
was
born
on
june
in
tuscumbia
a
little
town
of
northern
alabama
the
family
on
my
father
side
is
descended
from
caspar
keller
a
native
of
switzerland
who
settled
in
maryland
one
of
my
swiss
ancestors
was
the
first
teacher
of
the
deaf
in
zurich
and
wrote
a
book
on
the
subject
of
their
education
rather
a
singular
coincidence
though
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
king
who
has
not
had
a
slave
among
his
ancestors
and
no
slave
who
has
not
had
a
king
among
his
my
grandfather
caspar
keller
son
entered
large
tracts
of
land
in
alabama
and
finally
settled
there
i
have
been
told
that
once
a
year
he
went
from
tuscumbia
to
philadelphia
on
horseback
to
purchase
supplies
for
the
plantation
and
my
aunt
has
in
her
possession
many
of
the
letters
to
his
family
which
give
charming
and
vivid
accounts
of
these
trips
my
grandmother
keller
was
a
daughter
of
one
of
lafayette
aides
alexander
moore
and
granddaughter
of
alexander
spotswood
an
early
colonial
governor
of
virginia
she
was
also
second
cousin
to
robert
lee
my
father
arthur
keller
was
a
captain
in
the
confederate
army
and
my
mother
kate
adams
was
his
second
wife
and
many
years
younger
her
grandfather
benjamin
adams
married
susanna
goodhue
and
lived
in
newbury
massachusetts
for
many
years
their
son
charles
adams
was
born
in
newburyport
massachusetts
and
moved
to
helena
arkansas
when
the
civil
war
broke
out
he
fought
on
the
side
of
the
south
and
became
a
he
married
lucy
helen
everett
who
belonged
to
the
same
family
of
everetts
as
edward
everett
and
edward
everett
hale
after
the
war
was
over
the
family
moved
to
memphis
tennessee
i
lived
up
to
the
time
of
the
illness
that
deprived
me
of
my
sight
and
hearing
in
a
tiny
house
consisting
of
a
large
square
room
and
a
small
one
in
which
the
servant
slept
it
is
a
custom
in
the
south
to
build
a
small
house
near
the
homestead
as
an
annex
to
be
used
on
occasion
such
a
house
my
father
built
after
the
civil
war
and
when
he
married
my
mother
they
went
to
live
in
it
it
was
completely
covered
with
vines
climbing
roses
and
honeysuckles
from
the
garden
it
looked
like
an
arbour
the
little
porch
was
hidden
from
view
by
a
screen
of
yellow
roses
and
southern
smilax
it
was
the
favourite
haunt
of
and
bees
the
keller
homestead
where
the
family
lived
was
a
few
steps
from
our
little
it
was
called
ivy
green
because
the
house
and
the
surrounding
trees
and
fences
were
covered
with
beautiful
english
ivy
its
garden
was
the
paradise
of
my
childhood
even
in
the
days
before
my
teacher
came
i
used
to
feel
along
the
square
stiff
boxwood
hedges
and
guided
by
the
sense
of
smell
would
find
the
first
violets
and
lilies
there
too
after
a
fit
of
temper
i
went
to
find
comfort
and
to
hide
my
hot
face
in
the
cool
leaves
and
grass
what
joy
it
was
to
lose
myself
in
that
garden
of
flowers
to
wander
happily
from
spot
to
spot
until
coming
suddenly
upon
a
beautiful
vine
i
recognized
it
by
its
leaves
and
blossoms
and
knew
it
was
the
vine
which
covered
the
at
the
farther
end
of
the
garden
here
also
were
trailing
clematis
drooping
jessamine
and
some
rare
sweet
flowers
called
butterfly
lilies
because
their
fragile
petals
resemble
butterflies
wings
but
the
roses
they
were
loveliest
of
all
never
have
i
found
in
the
greenhouses
of
the
north
such
roses
as
the
climbing
roses
of
my
southern
home
they
used
to
hang
in
long
festoons
from
our
porch
filling
the
whole
air
with
their
fragrance
untainted
by
any
earthy
smell
and
in
the
early
morning
washed
in
the
dew
they
felt
so
soft
so
pure
i
could
not
help
wondering
if
they
did
not
resemble
the
asphodels
of
god
garden
the
beginning
of
my
life
was
simple
and
much
like
every
other
little
life
i
came
i
saw
i
conquered
as
the
first
baby
in
the
family
always
does
there
was
the
usual
amount
of
discussion
as
to
a
name
for
me
the
first
baby
in
the
family
was
not
to
be
lightly
named
every
one
was
emphatic
about
that
my
father
suggested
the
name
of
mildred
campbell
an
ancestor
whom
he
highly
esteemed
and
he
declined
to
take
any
further
part
in
the
discussion
my
mother
solved
the
problem
by
giving
it
as
her
wish
that
i
should
be
called
after
her
mother
whose
maiden
name
was
helen
everett
but
in
the
excitement
of
carrying
me
to
church
my
father
lost
the
name
on
the
way
very
naturally
since
it
was
one
in
which
he
had
declined
to
have
a
part
when
the
minister
asked
him
for
it
he
just
remembered
that
it
had
been
decided
to
call
me
after
my
grandmother
and
he
gave
her
name
as
helen
adams
i
am
told
that
while
i
was
still
in
long
dresses
i
showed
many
signs
of
an
eager
disposition
everything
that
i
saw
other
people
do
i
insisted
upon
imitating
at
six
months
i
could
pipe
out
how
d
and
one
day
i
attracted
every
one
attention
by
saying
tea
tea
tea
quite
plainly
even
after
my
illness
i
remembered
one
of
the
words
i
had
learned
in
these
early
months
it
was
the
word
water
and
i
continued
to
make
some
sound
for
that
word
after
all
other
speech
was
lost
i
ceased
making
the
sound
only
when
i
learned
to
spell
the
word
they
tell
me
i
walked
the
day
i
was
a
year
old
my
mother
had
just
taken
me
out
of
the
and
was
holding
me
in
her
lap
when
i
was
suddenly
attracted
by
the
flickering
shadows
of
leaves
that
danced
in
the
sunlight
on
the
smooth
floor
i
slipped
from
my
mother
lap
and
almost
ran
toward
them
the
impulse
gone
i
fell
down
and
cried
for
her
to
take
me
up
in
her
arms
these
happy
days
did
not
last
long
one
brief
spring
musical
with
the
song
of
robin
and
one
summer
rich
in
fruit
and
roses
one
autumn
of
gold
and
crimson
sped
by
and
left
their
gifts
at
the
feet
of
an
eager
delighted
child
then
in
the
dreary
month
of
february
came
the
illness
which
closed
my
eyes
and
ears
and
plunged
me
into
the
unconsciousness
of
a
baby
they
called
it
acute
congestion
of
the
stomach
and
brain
the
doctor
thought
i
could
not
live
early
one
morning
however
the
fever
left
me
as
suddenly
and
mysteriously
as
it
had
come
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
the
family
that
morning
but
no
one
not
even
the
doctor
knew
that
i
should
never
see
or
hear
again
i
fancy
i
still
have
confused
recollections
of
that
illness
i
especially
remember
the
tenderness
with
which
my
mother
tried
to
soothe
me
in
my
waling
hours
of
fret
and
pain
and
the
agony
and
bewilderment
with
which
i
awoke
after
a
tossing
half
sleep
and
turned
my
eyes
so
dry
and
hot
to
the
wall
away
from
the
light
which
came
to
me
dim
and
yet
more
dim
each
day
but
except
for
these
fleeting
memories
if
indeed
they
be
memories
it
all
seems
very
unreal
like
a
nightmare
gradually
i
got
used
to
the
silence
and
darkness
that
surrounded
me
and
forgot
that
it
had
ever
been
different
until
she
came
my
teacher
who
was
to
set
my
spirit
free
but
during
the
first
nineteen
months
of
my
life
i
had
caught
glimpses
of
broad
green
fields
a
luminous
sky
trees
and
flowers
which
the
darkness
that
followed
could
not
wholly
blot
out
if
we
have
once
seen
the
day
is
ours
and
what
the
day
has
shown
chapter
ii
i
can
not
recall
what
happened
during
the
first
months
after
my
illness
i
only
know
that
i
sat
in
my
mother
lap
or
clung
to
her
dress
as
she
went
about
her
household
duties
my
hands
felt
every
object
and
observed
every
motion
and
in
this
way
i
learned
to
know
many
things
soon
i
felt
the
need
of
some
communication
with
others
and
began
to
make
crude
signs
a
shake
of
the
head
meant
no
and
a
nod
yes
a
pull
meant
come
and
a
push
go
was
it
bread
that
i
wanted
then
i
would
imitate
the
acts
of
cutting
the
slices
and
buttering
them
if
i
wanted
my
mother
to
make
for
dinner
i
made
the
sign
for
working
the
freezer
and
shivered
indicating
cold
my
mother
moreover
succeeded
in
making
me
understand
a
good
deal
i
always
knew
when
she
wished
me
to
bring
her
something
and
i
would
run
upstairs
or
anywhere
else
she
indicated
indeed
i
owe
to
her
loving
wisdom
all
that
was
bright
and
good
in
my
long
night
i
understood
a
good
deal
of
what
was
going
on
about
me
at
five
i
learned
to
fold
and
put
away
the
clean
clothes
when
they
were
brought
in
from
the
laundry
and
i
distinguished
my
own
from
the
rest
i
knew
by
the
way
my
mother
and
aunt
dressed
when
they
were
going
out
and
i
invariably
begged
to
go
with
them
i
was
always
sent
for
when
there
was
company
and
when
the
guests
took
their
leave
i
waved
my
hand
to
them
i
think
with
a
vague
remembrance
of
the
meaning
of
the
gesture
one
day
some
gentlemen
called
on
my
mother
and
i
felt
the
shutting
of
the
front
door
and
other
sounds
that
indicated
their
arrival
on
a
sudden
thought
i
ran
upstairs
before
any
one
could
stop
me
to
put
on
my
idea
of
a
company
dress
standing
before
the
mirror
as
i
had
seen
others
do
i
anointed
mine
head
with
oil
and
covered
my
face
thickly
with
powder
then
i
pinned
a
veil
over
my
head
so
that
it
covered
my
face
and
fell
in
folds
down
to
my
shoulders
and
tied
an
enormous
bustle
round
my
small
waist
so
that
it
dangled
behind
almost
meeting
the
hem
of
my
skirt
thus
attired
i
went
down
to
help
entertain
the
company
i
do
not
remember
when
i
first
realized
that
i
was
different
from
other
people
but
i
knew
it
before
my
teacher
came
to
me
i
had
noticed
that
my
mother
and
my
friends
did
not
use
signs
as
i
did
when
they
wanted
anything
done
but
talked
with
their
mouths
sometimes
i
stood
between
two
persons
who
were
conversing
and
touched
their
lips
i
could
not
understand
and
was
vexed
i
moved
my
lips
and
gesticulated
frantically
without
result
this
made
me
so
angry
at
times
that
i
kicked
and
screamed
until
i
was
exhausted
i
think
i
knew
when
i
was
naughty
for
i
knew
that
it
hurt
ella
my
nurse
to
kick
her
and
when
my
fit
of
temper
was
over
i
had
a
feeling
akin
to
regret
but
i
can
not
remember
any
instance
in
which
this
feeling
prevented
me
from
repeating
the
naughtiness
when
i
failed
to
get
what
i
wanted
in
those
days
a
little
coloured
girl
martha
washington
the
child
of
our
cook
and
belle
an
old
setter
and
a
great
hunter
in
her
day
were
my
constant
companions
martha
washington
understood
my
signs
and
i
seldom
had
any
difficulty
in
making
her
do
just
as
i
wished
it
pleased
me
to
domineer
over
her
and
she
generally
submitted
to
my
tyranny
rather
than
risk
a
encounter
i
was
strong
active
indifferent
to
consequences
i
knew
my
own
mind
well
enough
and
always
had
my
own
way
even
if
i
had
to
fight
tooth
and
nail
for
it
we
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
the
kitchen
kneading
dough
balls
helping
make
grinding
coffee
quarreling
over
the
and
feeding
the
hens
and
turkeys
that
swarmed
about
the
kitchen
steps
many
of
them
were
so
tame
that
they
would
eat
from
my
hand
and
let
me
feel
them
one
big
gobbler
snatched
a
tomato
from
me
one
day
and
ran
away
with
it
inspired
perhaps
by
master
gobbler
success
we
carried
off
to
the
woodpile
a
cake
which
the
cook
had
just
frosted
and
ate
every
bit
of
it
i
was
quite
ill
afterward
and
i
wonder
if
retribution
also
overtook
the
turkey
the
likes
to
hide
her
nest
in
places
and
it
was
one
of
my
greatest
delights
to
hunt
for
the
eggs
in
the
long
grass
i
could
not
tell
martha
washington
when
i
wanted
to
go
but
i
would
double
my
hands
and
put
them
on
the
ground
which
meant
something
round
in
the
grass
and
martha
always
understood
when
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
nest
i
never
allowed
her
to
carry
the
eggs
home
making
her
understand
by
emphatic
signs
that
she
might
fall
and
break
them
the
sheds
where
the
corn
was
stored
the
stable
where
the
horses
were
kept
and
the
yard
where
the
cows
were
milked
morning
and
evening
were
unfailing
sources
of
interest
to
martha
and
me
the
milkers
would
let
me
keep
my
hands
on
the
cows
while
they
milked
and
i
often
got
well
switched
by
the
cow
for
my
curiosity
the
making
ready
for
christmas
was
always
a
delight
to
me
of
course
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
all
about
but
i
enjoyed
the
pleasant
odours
that
filled
the
house
and
the
tidbits
that
were
given
to
martha
washington
and
me
to
keep
us
quiet
we
were
sadly
in
the
way
but
that
did
not
interfere
with
our
pleasure
in
the
least
they
allowed
us
to
grind
the
spices
pick
over
the
raisins
and
lick
the
stirring
spoons
i
hung
my
stocking
because
the
others
did
i
can
not
remember
however
that
the
ceremony
interested
me
especially
nor
did
my
curiosity
cause
me
to
wake
before
daylight
to
look
for
my
gifts
martha
washington
had
as
great
a
love
of
mischief
as
i
two
little
children
were
seated
on
the
veranda
steps
one
hot
july
afternoon
one
was
black
as
ebony
with
little
bunches
of
fuzzy
hair
tied
with
shoestrings
sticking
out
all
over
her
head
like
corkscrews
the
other
was
white
with
long
golden
curls
one
child
was
six
years
old
the
other
two
or
three
years
older
the
younger
child
was
blind
that
was
i
and
the
other
was
martha
washington
we
were
busy
cutting
out
paper
dolls
but
we
soon
wearied
of
this
amusement
and
after
cutting
up
our
shoestrings
and
clipping
all
the
leaves
off
the
honeysuckle
that
were
within
reach
i
turned
my
attention
to
martha
corkscrews
she
objected
at
first
but
finally
submitted
thinking
that
turn
and
turn
about
is
fair
play
she
seized
the
scissors
and
cut
off
one
of
my
curls
and
would
have
cut
them
all
off
but
for
my
mother
timely
interference
belle
our
dog
my
other
companion
was
old
and
lazy
and
liked
to
sleep
by
the
open
fire
rather
than
to
romp
with
me
i
tried
hard
to
teach
her
my
sign
language
but
she
was
dull
and
inattentive
she
sometimes
started
and
quivered
with
excitement
then
she
became
perfectly
rigid
as
dogs
do
when
they
point
a
bird
i
did
not
then
know
why
belle
acted
in
this
way
but
i
knew
she
was
not
doing
as
i
wished
this
vexed
me
and
the
lesson
always
ended
in
a
boxing
match
belle
would
get
up
stretch
herself
lazily
give
one
or
two
contemptuous
sniffs
go
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
and
lie
down
again
and
i
wearied
and
disappointed
went
off
in
search
of
martha
many
incidents
of
those
early
years
are
fixed
in
my
memory
isolated
but
clear
and
distinct
making
the
sense
of
that
silent
aimless
dayless
life
all
the
more
intense
one
day
i
happened
to
spill
water
on
my
apron
and
i
spread
it
out
to
dry
before
the
fire
which
was
flickering
on
the
hearth
the
apron
did
not
dry
quickly
enough
to
suit
me
so
i
drew
nearer
and
threw
it
right
over
the
hot
ashes
the
fire
leaped
into
life
the
flames
encircled
me
so
that
in
a
moment
my
clothes
were
blazing
i
made
a
terrified
noise
that
brought
viny
my
old
nurse
to
the
rescue
throwing
a
blanket
over
me
she
almost
suffocated
me
but
she
put
out
the
fire
except
for
my
hands
and
hair
i
was
not
badly
burned
about
this
time
i
found
out
the
use
of
a
key
one
morning
i
locked
my
mother
up
in
the
pantry
where
she
was
obliged
to
remain
three
hours
as
the
servants
were
in
a
detached
part
of
the
house
she
kept
pounding
on
the
door
while
i
sat
outside
on
the
porch
steps
and
laughed
with
glee
as
i
felt
the
jar
of
the
pounding
this
most
naughty
prank
of
mine
convinced
my
parents
that
i
must
be
taught
as
soon
as
possible
after
my
teacher
miss
sullivan
came
to
me
i
sought
an
early
opportunity
to
lock
her
in
her
room
i
went
upstairs
with
something
which
my
mother
made
me
understand
i
was
to
give
to
miss
sullivan
but
no
sooner
had
i
given
it
to
her
than
i
slammed
the
door
to
locked
it
and
hid
the
key
under
the
wardrobe
in
the
hall
i
could
not
be
induced
to
tell
where
the
key
was
my
father
was
obliged
to
get
a
ladder
and
take
miss
sullivan
out
through
the
window
much
to
my
delight
months
after
i
produced
the
key
when
i
was
about
five
years
old
we
moved
from
the
little
house
to
a
large
new
one
the
family
consisted
of
my
father
and
mother
two
older
and
afterward
a
little
sister
mildred
my
earliest
distinct
recollection
of
my
father
is
making
my
way
through
great
drifts
of
newspapers
to
his
side
and
finding
him
alone
holding
a
sheet
of
paper
before
his
face
i
was
greatly
puzzled
to
know
what
he
was
doing
i
imitated
this
action
even
wearing
his
spectacles
thinking
they
might
help
solve
the
mystery
but
i
did
not
find
out
the
secret
for
several
years
then
i
learned
what
those
papers
were
and
that
my
father
edited
one
of
them
my
father
was
most
loving
and
indulgent
devoted
to
his
home
seldom
leaving
us
except
in
the
hunting
season
he
was
a
great
hunter
i
have
been
told
and
a
celebrated
shot
next
to
his
family
he
loved
his
dogs
and
gun
his
hospitality
was
great
almost
to
a
fault
and
he
seldom
came
home
without
bringing
a
guest
his
special
pride
was
the
big
garden
where
it
was
said
he
raised
the
finest
watermelons
and
strawberries
in
the
county
and
to
me
he
brought
the
first
ripe
grapes
and
the
choicest
berries
i
remember
his
caressing
touch
as
he
led
me
from
tree
to
tree
from
vine
to
vine
and
his
eager
delight
in
whatever
pleased
me
he
was
a
famous
after
i
had
acquired
language
he
used
to
spell
clumsily
into
my
hand
his
cleverest
anecdotes
and
nothing
pleased
him
more
than
to
have
me
repeat
them
at
an
opportune
moment
i
was
in
the
north
enjoying
the
last
beautiful
days
of
the
summer
of
when
i
heard
the
news
of
my
father
death
he
had
had
a
short
illness
there
had
been
a
brief
time
of
acute
suffering
then
all
was
over
this
was
my
first
great
sorrow
my
first
personal
experience
with
death
how
shall
i
write
of
my
mother
she
is
so
near
to
me
that
it
almost
seems
indelicate
to
speak
of
her
for
a
long
time
i
regarded
my
little
sister
as
an
intruder
i
knew
that
i
had
ceased
to
be
my
mother
only
darling
and
the
thought
filled
me
with
jealousy
she
sat
in
my
mother
lap
constantly
where
i
used
to
sit
and
seemed
to
take
up
all
her
care
and
time
one
day
something
happened
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
adding
insult
to
injury
at
that
time
i
had
a
doll
which
i
afterward
named
nancy
she
was
alas
the
helpless
victim
of
my
outbursts
of
temper
and
of
affection
so
that
she
became
much
the
worse
for
wear
i
had
dolls
which
talked
and
cried
and
opened
and
shut
their
eyes
yet
i
never
loved
one
of
them
as
i
loved
poor
nancy
she
had
a
cradle
and
i
often
spent
an
hour
or
more
rocking
her
i
guarded
both
doll
and
cradle
with
the
most
jealous
care
but
once
i
discovered
my
little
sister
sleeping
peacefully
in
the
cradle
at
this
presumption
on
the
part
of
one
to
whom
as
yet
no
tie
of
love
bound
me
i
grew
angry
i
rushed
upon
the
cradle
and
it
and
the
baby
might
have
been
killed
had
my
mother
not
caught
her
as
she
fell
thus
it
is
that
when
we
walk
in
the
valley
of
twofold
solitude
we
know
little
of
the
tender
affections
that
grow
out
of
endearing
words
and
actions
and
companionship
but
afterward
when
i
was
restored
to
my
human
heritage
mildred
and
i
grew
into
each
other
hearts
so
that
we
were
content
to
go
wherever
caprice
led
us
although
she
could
not
understand
my
finger
language
nor
i
her
childish
prattle
chapter
iii
meanwhile
the
desire
to
express
myself
grew
the
few
signs
i
used
became
less
and
less
adequate
and
my
failures
to
make
myself
understood
were
invariably
followed
by
outbursts
of
passion
i
felt
as
if
invisible
hands
were
holding
me
and
i
made
frantic
efforts
to
free
myself
i
struggled
not
that
struggling
helped
matters
but
the
spirit
of
resistance
was
strong
within
me
i
generally
broke
down
in
tears
and
physical
exhaustion
if
my
mother
happened
to
be
near
i
crept
into
her
arms
too
miserable
even
to
remember
the
cause
of
the
tempest
after
awhile
the
need
of
some
means
of
communication
became
so
urgent
that
these
outbursts
occurred
daily
sometimes
hourly
my
parents
were
deeply
grieved
and
perplexed
we
lived
a
long
way
from
any
school
for
the
blind
or
the
deaf
and
it
seemed
unlikely
that
any
one
would
come
to
such
an
place
as
tuscumbia
to
teach
a
child
who
was
both
deaf
and
blind
indeed
my
friends
and
relatives
sometimes
doubted
whether
i
could
be
taught
my
mother
only
ray
of
hope
came
from
dickens
american
notes
she
had
read
his
account
of
laura
bridgman
and
remembered
vaguely
that
she
was
deaf
and
blind
yet
had
been
educated
but
she
also
remembered
with
a
hopeless
pang
that
howe
who
had
discovered
the
way
to
teach
the
deaf
and
blind
had
been
dead
many
years
his
methods
had
probably
died
with
him
and
if
they
had
not
how
was
a
little
girl
in
a
town
in
alabama
to
receive
the
benefit
of
them
when
i
was
about
six
years
old
my
father
heard
of
an
eminent
oculist
in
baltimore
who
had
been
successful
in
many
cases
that
had
seemed
hopeless
my
parents
at
once
determined
to
take
me
to
baltimore
to
see
if
anything
could
be
done
for
my
eyes
the
journey
which
i
remember
well
was
very
pleasant
i
made
friends
with
many
people
on
the
train
one
lady
gave
me
a
box
of
shells
my
father
made
holes
in
these
so
that
i
could
string
them
and
for
a
long
time
they
kept
me
happy
and
contented
the
conductor
too
was
kind
often
when
he
went
his
rounds
i
clung
to
his
coat
tails
while
he
collected
and
punched
the
tickets
his
punch
with
which
he
let
me
play
was
a
delightful
toy
curled
up
in
a
corner
of
the
seat
i
amused
myself
for
hours
making
funny
little
holes
in
bits
of
cardboard
my
aunt
made
me
a
big
doll
out
of
towels
it
was
the
most
comical
shapeless
thing
this
improvised
doll
with
no
nose
mouth
ears
or
eyes
nothing
that
even
the
imagination
of
a
child
could
convert
into
a
face
curiously
enough
the
absence
of
eyes
struck
me
more
than
all
the
other
defects
put
together
i
pointed
this
out
to
everybody
with
provoking
persistency
but
no
one
seemed
equal
to
the
task
of
providing
the
doll
with
eyes
a
bright
idea
however
shot
into
my
mind
and
the
problem
was
solved
i
tumbled
off
the
seat
and
searched
under
it
until
i
found
my
aunt
cape
which
was
trimmed
with
large
beads
i
pulled
two
beads
off
and
indicated
to
her
that
i
wanted
her
to
sew
them
on
my
doll
she
raised
my
hand
to
her
eyes
in
a
questioning
way
and
i
nodded
energetically
the
beads
were
sewed
in
the
right
place
and
i
could
not
contain
myself
for
joy
but
immediately
i
lost
all
interest
in
the
doll
during
the
whole
trip
i
did
not
have
one
fit
of
temper
there
were
so
many
things
to
keep
my
mind
and
fingers
busy
when
we
arrived
in
baltimore
chisholm
received
us
kindly
but
he
could
do
nothing
he
said
however
that
i
could
be
educated
and
advised
my
father
to
consult
alexander
graham
bell
of
washington
who
would
be
able
to
give
him
information
about
schools
and
teachers
of
deaf
or
blind
children
acting
on
the
doctor
advice
we
went
immediately
to
washington
to
see
bell
my
father
with
a
sad
heart
and
many
misgivings
i
wholly
unconscious
of
his
anguish
finding
pleasure
in
the
excitement
of
moving
from
place
to
place
child
as
i
was
i
at
once
felt
the
tenderness
and
sympathy
which
endeared
bell
to
so
many
hearts
as
his
wonderful
achievements
enlist
their
admiration
he
held
me
on
his
knee
while
i
examined
his
watch
and
he
made
it
strike
for
me
he
understood
my
signs
and
i
knew
it
and
loved
him
at
once
but
i
did
not
dream
that
that
interview
would
be
the
door
through
which
i
should
pass
from
darkness
into
light
from
isolation
to
friendship
companionship
knowledge
love
bell
advised
my
father
to
write
to
anagnos
director
of
the
perkins
institution
in
boston
the
scene
of
howe
great
labours
for
the
blind
and
ask
him
if
he
had
a
teacher
competent
to
begin
my
education
this
my
father
did
at
once
and
in
a
few
weeks
there
came
a
kind
letter
from
anagnos
with
the
comforting
assurance
that
a
teacher
had
been
found
this
was
in
the
summer
of
but
miss
sullivan
did
not
arrive
until
the
following
march
thus
i
came
up
out
of
egypt
and
stood
before
sinai
and
a
power
divine
touched
my
spirit
and
gave
it
sight
so
that
i
beheld
many
wonders
and
from
the
sacred
mountain
i
heard
a
voice
which
said
knowledge
is
love
and
light
and
vision
chapter
iv
the
most
important
day
i
remember
in
all
my
life
is
the
one
on
which
my
teacher
anne
mansfield
sullivan
came
to
me
i
am
filled
with
wonder
when
i
consider
the
immeasurable
contrasts
between
the
two
lives
which
it
connects
it
was
the
third
of
march
three
months
before
i
was
seven
years
old
on
the
afternoon
of
that
eventful
day
i
stood
on
the
porch
dumb
expectant
i
guessed
vaguely
from
my
mother
signs
and
from
the
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
the
house
that
something
unusual
was
about
to
happen
so
i
went
to
the
door
and
waited
on
the
steps
the
afternoon
sun
penetrated
the
mass
of
honeysuckle
that
covered
the
porch
and
fell
on
my
upturned
face
my
fingers
lingered
almost
unconsciously
on
the
familiar
leaves
and
blossoms
which
had
just
come
forth
to
greet
the
sweet
southern
spring
i
did
not
know
what
the
future
held
of
marvel
or
surprise
for
me
anger
and
bitterness
had
preyed
upon
me
continually
for
weeks
and
a
deep
languor
had
succeeded
this
passionate
struggle
have
you
ever
been
at
sea
in
a
dense
fog
when
it
seemed
as
if
a
tangible
white
darkness
shut
you
in
and
the
great
ship
tense
and
anxious
groped
her
way
toward
the
shore
with
plummet
and
and
you
waited
with
beating
heart
for
something
to
happen
i
was
like
that
ship
before
my
education
began
only
i
was
without
compass
or
and
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
near
the
harbour
was
light
give
me
light
was
the
wordless
cry
of
my
soul
and
the
light
of
love
shone
on
me
in
that
very
hour
i
felt
approaching
footsteps
i
stretched
out
my
hand
as
i
supposed
to
my
mother
some
one
took
it
and
i
was
caught
up
and
held
close
in
the
arms
of
her
who
had
come
to
reveal
all
things
to
me
and
more
than
all
things
else
to
love
me
the
morning
after
my
teacher
came
she
led
me
into
her
room
and
gave
me
a
doll
the
little
blind
children
at
the
perkins
institution
had
sent
it
and
laura
bridgman
had
dressed
it
but
i
did
not
know
this
until
afterward
when
i
had
played
with
it
a
little
while
miss
sullivan
slowly
spelled
into
my
hand
the
word
i
was
at
once
interested
in
this
finger
play
and
tried
to
imitate
it
when
i
finally
succeeded
in
making
the
letters
correctly
i
was
flushed
with
childish
pleasure
and
pride
running
downstairs
to
my
mother
i
held
up
my
hand
and
made
the
letters
for
doll
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
spelling
a
word
or
even
that
words
existed
i
was
simply
making
my
fingers
go
in
imitation
in
the
days
that
followed
i
learned
to
spell
in
this
uncomprehending
way
a
great
many
words
among
them
pin
hat
cup
and
a
few
verbs
like
sit
stand
and
walk
but
my
teacher
had
been
with
me
several
weeks
before
i
understood
that
everything
has
a
name
one
day
while
i
was
playing
with
my
new
doll
miss
sullivan
put
my
big
rag
doll
into
my
lap
also
spelled
and
tried
to
make
me
understand
that
applied
to
both
earlier
in
the
day
we
had
had
a
tussle
over
the
words
and
miss
sullivan
had
tried
to
impress
it
upon
me
that
is
mug
and
that
is
water
but
i
persisted
in
confounding
the
two
in
despair
she
had
dropped
the
subject
for
the
time
only
to
renew
it
at
the
first
opportunity
i
became
impatient
at
her
repeated
attempts
and
seizing
the
new
doll
i
dashed
it
upon
the
floor
i
was
keenly
delighted
when
i
felt
the
fragments
of
the
broken
doll
at
my
feet
neither
sorrow
nor
regret
followed
my
passionate
outburst
i
had
not
loved
the
doll
in
the
still
dark
world
in
which
i
lived
there
was
no
strong
sentiment
or
tenderness
i
felt
my
teacher
sweep
the
fragments
to
one
side
of
the
hearth
and
i
had
a
sense
of
satisfaction
that
the
cause
of
my
discomfort
was
removed
she
brought
me
my
hat
and
i
knew
i
was
going
out
into
the
warm
sunshine
this
thought
if
a
wordless
sensation
may
be
called
a
thought
made
me
hop
and
skip
with
pleasure
we
walked
down
the
path
to
the
attracted
by
the
fragrance
of
the
honeysuckle
with
which
it
was
covered
some
one
was
drawing
water
and
my
teacher
placed
my
hand
under
the
spout
as
the
cool
stream
gushed
over
one
hand
she
spelled
into
the
other
the
word
water
first
slowly
then
rapidly
i
stood
still
my
whole
attention
fixed
upon
the
motions
of
her
fingers
suddenly
i
felt
a
misty
consciousness
as
of
something
forgotten
a
thrill
of
returning
thought
and
somehow
the
mystery
of
language
was
revealed
to
me
i
knew
then
that
meant
the
wonderful
cool
something
that
was
flowing
over
my
hand
that
living
word
awakened
my
soul
gave
it
light
hope
joy
set
it
free
there
were
barriers
still
it
is
true
but
barriers
that
could
in
time
be
swept
away
i
left
the
eager
to
learn
everything
had
a
name
and
each
name
gave
birth
to
a
new
thought
as
we
returned
to
the
house
every
object
which
i
touched
seemed
to
quiver
with
life
that
was
because
i
saw
everything
with
the
strange
new
sight
that
had
come
to
me
on
entering
the
door
i
remembered
the
doll
i
had
broken
i
felt
my
way
to
the
hearth
and
picked
up
the
pieces
i
tried
vainly
to
put
them
together
then
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
for
i
realized
what
i
had
done
and
for
the
first
time
i
felt
repentance
and
sorrow
i
learned
a
great
many
new
words
that
day
i
do
not
remember
what
they
all
were
but
i
do
know
that
mother
father
sister
teacher
were
among
them
words
that
were
to
make
the
world
blossom
for
me
like
rod
with
flowers
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
happier
child
than
i
was
as
i
lay
in
my
crib
at
the
close
of
that
eventful
day
and
lived
over
the
joys
it
had
brought
me
and
for
the
first
time
longed
for
a
new
day
to
come
chapter
v
i
recall
many
incidents
of
the
summer
of
that
followed
my
sudden
awakening
i
did
nothing
but
explore
with
my
hands
and
learn
the
name
of
every
object
that
i
touched
and
the
more
i
handled
things
and
learned
their
names
and
uses
the
more
joyous
and
confident
grew
my
sense
of
kinship
with
the
rest
of
the
world
when
the
time
of
daisies
and
buttercups
came
miss
sullivan
took
me
by
the
hand
across
the
fields
where
men
were
preparing
the
earth
for
the
seed
to
the
banks
of
the
tennessee
river
and
there
sitting
on
the
warm
grass
i
had
my
first
lessons
in
the
beneficence
of
nature
i
learned
how
the
sun
and
the
rain
make
to
grow
out
of
the
ground
every
tree
that
is
pleasant
to
the
sight
and
good
for
food
how
birds
build
their
nests
and
live
and
thrive
from
land
to
land
how
the
squirrel
the
deer
the
lion
and
every
other
creature
finds
food
and
shelter
as
my
knowledge
of
things
grew
i
felt
more
and
more
the
delight
of
the
world
i
was
in
long
before
i
learned
to
do
a
sum
in
arithmetic
or
describe
the
shape
of
the
earth
miss
sullivan
had
taught
me
to
find
beauty
in
the
fragrant
woods
in
every
blade
of
grass
and
in
the
curves
and
dimples
of
my
baby
sister
hand
she
linked
my
earliest
thoughts
with
nature
and
made
me
feel
that
birds
and
flowers
and
i
were
happy
peers
but
about
this
time
i
had
an
experience
which
taught
me
that
nature
is
not
always
kind
one
day
my
teacher
and
i
were
returning
from
a
long
ramble
the
morning
had
been
fine
but
it
was
growing
warm
and
sultry
when
at
last
we
turned
our
faces
homeward
two
or
three
times
we
stopped
to
rest
under
a
tree
by
the
wayside
our
last
halt
was
under
a
wild
cherry
tree
a
short
distance
from
the
house
the
shade
was
grateful
and
the
tree
was
so
easy
to
climb
that
with
my
teacher
assistance
i
was
able
to
scramble
to
a
seat
in
the
branches
it
was
so
cool
up
in
the
tree
that
miss
sullivan
proposed
that
we
have
our
luncheon
there
i
promised
to
keep
still
while
she
went
to
the
house
to
fetch
it
suddenly
a
change
passed
over
the
tree
all
the
sun
warmth
left
the
air
i
knew
the
sky
was
black
because
all
the
heat
which
meant
light
to
me
had
died
out
of
the
atmosphere
a
strange
odour
came
up
from
the
earth
i
knew
it
it
was
the
odour
that
always
precedes
a
thunderstorm
and
a
nameless
fear
clutched
at
my
heart
i
felt
absolutely
alone
cut
off
from
my
friends
and
the
firm
earth
the
immense
the
unknown
enfolded
me
i
remained
still
and
expectant
a
chilling
terror
crept
over
me
i
longed
for
my
teacher
return
but
above
all
things
i
wanted
to
get
down
from
that
tree
there
was
a
moment
of
sinister
silence
then
a
multitudinous
stirring
of
the
leaves
a
shiver
ran
through
the
tree
and
the
wind
sent
forth
a
blast
that
would
have
knocked
me
off
had
i
not
clung
to
the
branch
with
might
and
main
the
tree
swayed
and
strained
the
small
twigs
snapped
and
fell
about
me
in
showers
a
wild
impulse
to
jump
seized
me
but
terror
held
me
fast
i
crouched
down
in
the
fork
of
the
tree
the
branches
lashed
about
me
i
felt
the
intermittent
jarring
that
came
now
and
then
as
if
something
heavy
had
fallen
and
the
shock
had
traveled
up
till
it
reached
the
limb
i
sat
on
it
worked
my
suspense
up
to
the
highest
point
and
just
as
i
was
thinking
the
tree
and
i
should
fall
together
my
teacher
seized
my
hand
and
helped
me
down
i
clung
to
her
trembling
with
joy
to
feel
the
earth
under
my
feet
once
more
i
had
learned
a
new
lesson
that
nature
wages
open
war
against
her
children
and
under
softest
touch
hides
treacherous
claws
after
this
experience
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
climbed
another
tree
the
mere
thought
filled
me
with
terror
it
was
the
sweet
allurement
of
the
mimosa
tree
in
full
bloom
that
finally
overcame
my
fears
one
beautiful
spring
morning
when
i
was
alone
in
the
reading
i
became
aware
of
a
wonderful
subtle
fragrance
in
the
air
i
started
up
and
instinctively
stretched
out
my
hands
it
seemed
as
if
the
spirit
of
spring
had
passed
through
the
what
is
it
i
asked
and
the
next
minute
i
recognized
the
odour
of
the
mimosa
blossoms
i
felt
my
way
to
the
end
of
the
garden
knowing
that
the
mimosa
tree
was
near
the
fence
at
the
turn
of
the
path
yes
there
it
was
all
quivering
in
the
warm
sunshine
its
branches
almost
touching
the
long
grass
was
there
ever
anything
so
exquisitely
beautiful
in
the
world
before
its
delicate
blossoms
shrank
from
the
slightest
earthly
touch
it
seemed
as
if
a
tree
of
paradise
had
been
transplanted
to
earth
i
made
my
way
through
a
shower
of
petals
to
the
great
trunk
and
for
one
minute
stood
irresolute
then
putting
my
foot
in
the
broad
space
between
the
forked
branches
i
pulled
myself
up
into
the
tree
i
had
some
difficulty
in
holding
on
for
the
branches
were
very
large
and
the
bark
hurt
my
hands
but
i
had
a
delicious
sense
that
i
was
doing
something
unusual
and
wonderful
so
i
kept
on
climbing
higher
and
higher
until
i
reached
a
little
seat
which
somebody
had
built
there
so
long
ago
that
it
had
grown
part
of
the
tree
itself
i
sat
there
for
a
long
long
time
feeling
like
a
fairy
on
a
rosy
cloud
after
that
i
spent
many
happy
hours
in
my
tree
of
paradise
thinking
fair
thoughts
and
dreaming
bright
dreams
chapter
vi
i
had
now
the
key
to
all
language
and
i
was
eager
to
learn
to
use
it
children
who
hear
acquire
language
without
any
particular
effort
the
words
that
fall
from
others
lips
they
catch
on
the
wing
as
it
were
delightedly
while
the
little
deaf
child
must
trap
them
by
a
slow
and
often
painful
process
but
whatever
the
process
the
result
is
wonderful
gradually
from
naming
an
object
we
advance
step
by
step
until
we
have
traversed
the
vast
distance
between
our
first
stammered
syllable
and
the
sweep
of
thought
in
a
line
of
shakespeare
at
first
when
my
teacher
told
me
about
a
new
thing
i
asked
very
few
questions
my
ideas
were
vague
and
my
vocabulary
was
inadequate
but
as
my
knowledge
of
things
grew
and
i
learned
more
and
more
words
my
field
of
inquiry
broadened
and
i
would
return
again
and
again
to
the
same
subject
eager
for
further
information
sometimes
a
new
word
revived
an
image
that
some
earlier
experience
had
engraved
on
my
brain
i
remember
the
morning
that
i
first
asked
the
meaning
of
the
word
love
this
was
before
i
knew
many
words
i
had
found
a
few
early
violets
in
the
garden
and
brought
them
to
my
teacher
she
tried
to
kiss
me
but
at
that
time
i
did
not
like
to
have
any
one
kiss
me
except
my
mother
miss
sullivan
put
her
arm
gently
round
me
and
spelled
into
my
hand
i
love
helen
what
is
love
i
asked
she
drew
me
closer
to
her
and
said
it
is
here
pointing
to
my
heart
whose
beats
i
was
conscious
of
for
the
first
time
her
words
puzzled
me
very
much
because
i
did
not
then
understand
anything
unless
i
touched
it
i
smelt
the
violets
in
her
hand
and
asked
half
in
words
half
in
signs
a
question
which
meant
is
love
the
sweetness
of
flowers
no
said
my
teacher
again
i
thought
the
warm
sun
was
shining
on
us
is
this
not
love
i
asked
pointing
in
the
direction
from
which
the
heat
came
is
this
not
love
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
could
be
nothing
more
beautiful
than
the
sun
whose
warmth
makes
all
things
grow
but
miss
sullivan
shook
her
head
and
i
was
greatly
puzzled
and
disappointed
i
thought
it
strange
that
my
teacher
could
not
show
me
love
a
day
or
two
afterward
i
was
stringing
beads
of
different
sizes
in
symmetrical
groups
two
large
beads
three
small
ones
and
so
on
i
had
made
many
mistakes
and
miss
sullivan
had
pointed
them
out
again
and
again
with
gentle
patience
finally
i
noticed
a
very
obvious
error
in
the
sequence
and
for
an
instant
i
concentrated
my
attention
on
the
lesson
and
tried
to
think
how
i
should
have
arranged
the
beads
miss
sullivan
touched
my
forehead
and
spelled
with
decided
emphasis
think
in
a
flash
i
knew
that
the
word
was
the
name
of
the
process
that
was
going
on
in
my
head
this
was
my
first
conscious
perception
of
an
abstract
idea
for
a
long
time
i
was
still
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
beads
in
my
lap
but
trying
to
find
a
meaning
for
love
in
the
light
of
this
new
idea
the
sun
had
been
under
a
cloud
all
day
and
there
had
been
brief
showers
but
suddenly
the
sun
broke
forth
in
all
its
southern
splendour
again
i
asked
my
teacher
is
this
not
love
love
is
something
like
the
clouds
that
were
in
the
sky
before
the
sun
came
out
she
replied
then
in
simpler
words
than
these
which
at
that
time
i
could
not
have
understood
she
explained
you
can
not
touch
the
clouds
you
know
but
you
feel
the
rain
and
know
how
glad
the
flowers
and
the
thirsty
earth
are
to
have
it
after
a
hot
day
you
can
not
touch
love
either
but
you
feel
the
sweetness
that
it
pours
into
everything
without
love
you
would
not
be
happy
or
want
to
play
the
beautiful
truth
burst
upon
my
mind
i
felt
that
there
were
invisible
lines
stretched
between
my
spirit
and
the
spirits
of
others
from
the
beginning
of
my
education
miss
sullivan
made
it
a
practice
to
speak
to
me
as
she
would
speak
to
any
hearing
child
the
only
difference
was
that
she
spelled
the
sentences
into
my
hand
instead
of
speaking
them
if
i
did
not
know
the
words
and
idioms
necessary
to
express
my
thoughts
she
supplied
them
even
suggesting
conversation
when
i
was
unable
to
keep
up
my
end
of
the
dialogue
this
process
was
continued
for
several
years
for
the
deaf
child
does
not
learn
in
a
month
or
even
in
two
or
three
years
the
numberless
idioms
and
expressions
used
in
the
simplest
daily
intercourse
the
little
hearing
child
learns
these
from
constant
repetition
and
imitation
the
conversation
he
hears
in
his
home
stimulates
his
mind
and
suggests
topics
and
calls
forth
the
spontaneous
expression
of
his
own
thoughts
this
natural
exchange
of
ideas
is
denied
to
the
deaf
child
my
teacher
realizing
this
determined
to
supply
the
kinds
of
stimulus
i
lacked
this
she
did
by
repeating
to
me
as
far
as
possible
verbatim
what
she
heard
and
by
showing
me
how
i
could
take
part
in
the
conversation
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
ventured
to
take
the
initiative
and
still
longer
before
i
could
find
something
appropriate
to
say
at
the
right
time
the
deaf
and
the
blind
find
it
very
difficult
to
acquire
the
amenities
of
conversation
how
much
more
this
difficulty
must
be
augmented
in
the
case
of
those
who
are
both
deaf
and
blind
they
can
not
distinguish
the
tone
of
the
voice
or
without
assistance
go
up
and
down
the
gamut
of
tones
that
give
significance
to
words
nor
can
they
watch
the
expression
of
the
speaker
face
and
a
look
is
often
the
very
soul
of
what
one
says
chapter
vii
the
next
important
step
in
my
education
was
learning
to
read
as
soon
as
i
could
spell
a
few
words
my
teacher
gave
me
slips
of
cardboard
on
which
were
printed
words
in
raised
letters
i
quickly
learned
that
each
printed
word
stood
for
an
object
an
act
or
a
quality
i
had
a
frame
in
which
i
could
arrange
the
words
in
little
sentences
but
before
i
ever
put
sentences
in
the
frame
i
used
to
make
them
in
objects
i
found
the
slips
of
paper
which
represented
for
example
doll
is
on
bed
and
placed
each
name
on
its
object
then
i
put
my
doll
on
the
bed
with
the
words
is
on
bed
arranged
beside
the
doll
thus
making
a
sentence
of
the
words
and
at
the
same
time
carrying
out
the
idea
of
the
sentence
with
the
things
themselves
one
day
miss
sullivan
tells
me
i
pinned
the
word
girl
on
my
pinafore
and
stood
in
the
wardrobe
on
the
shelf
i
arranged
the
words
is
in
wardrobe
nothing
delighted
me
so
much
as
this
game
my
teacher
and
i
played
it
for
hours
at
a
time
often
everything
in
the
room
was
arranged
in
object
sentences
from
the
printed
slip
it
was
but
a
step
to
the
printed
book
i
took
my
reader
for
beginners
and
hunted
for
the
words
i
knew
when
i
found
them
my
joy
was
like
that
of
a
game
of
thus
i
began
to
read
of
the
time
when
i
began
to
read
connected
stories
i
shall
speak
later
for
a
long
time
i
had
no
regular
lessons
even
when
i
studied
most
earnestly
it
seemed
more
like
play
than
work
everything
miss
sullivan
taught
me
she
illustrated
by
a
beautiful
story
or
a
poem
whenever
anything
delighted
or
interested
me
she
talked
it
over
with
me
just
as
if
she
were
a
little
girl
herself
what
many
children
think
of
with
dread
as
a
painful
plodding
through
grammar
hard
sums
and
harder
definitions
is
one
of
my
most
precious
memories
i
can
not
explain
the
peculiar
sympathy
miss
sullivan
had
with
my
pleasures
and
desires
perhaps
it
was
the
result
of
long
association
with
the
blind
added
to
this
she
had
a
wonderful
faculty
for
description
she
went
quickly
over
uninteresting
details
and
never
nagged
me
with
questions
to
see
if
i
remembered
the
lesson
she
introduced
dry
technicalities
of
science
little
by
little
making
every
subject
so
real
that
i
could
not
help
remembering
what
she
taught
we
read
and
studied
out
of
doors
preferring
the
sunlit
woods
to
the
house
all
my
early
lessons
have
in
them
the
breath
of
the
woods
the
fine
resinous
odour
of
pine
needles
blended
with
the
perfume
of
wild
grapes
seated
in
the
gracious
shade
of
a
wild
tulip
tree
i
learned
to
think
that
everything
has
a
lesson
and
a
suggestion
the
loveliness
of
things
taught
me
all
their
use
indeed
everything
that
could
hum
or
buzz
or
sing
or
bloom
had
a
part
in
my
frogs
katydids
and
crickets
held
in
my
hand
until
forgetting
their
embarrassment
they
trilled
their
reedy
note
little
downy
chickens
and
wildflowers
the
dogwood
blossoms
and
budding
fruit
trees
i
felt
the
bursting
and
fingered
their
soft
fiber
and
fuzzy
seeds
i
felt
the
low
soughing
of
the
wind
through
the
cornstalks
the
silky
rustling
of
the
long
leaves
and
the
indignant
snort
of
my
pony
as
we
caught
him
in
the
pasture
and
put
the
bit
in
his
mouth
ah
me
how
well
i
remember
the
spicy
clovery
smell
of
his
breath
sometimes
i
rose
at
dawn
and
stole
into
the
garden
while
the
heavy
dew
lay
on
the
grass
and
flowers
few
know
what
joy
it
is
to
feel
the
roses
pressing
softly
into
the
hand
or
the
beautiful
motion
of
the
lilies
as
they
sway
in
the
morning
breeze
sometimes
i
caught
an
insect
in
the
flower
i
was
plucking
and
i
felt
the
faint
noise
of
a
pair
of
wings
rubbed
together
in
a
sudden
terror
as
the
little
creature
became
aware
of
a
pressure
from
without
another
favourite
haunt
of
mine
was
the
orchard
where
the
fruit
ripened
early
in
july
the
large
downy
peaches
would
reach
themselves
into
my
hand
and
as
the
joyous
breezes
flew
about
the
trees
the
apples
tumbled
at
my
feet
oh
the
delight
with
which
i
gathered
up
the
fruit
in
my
pinafore
pressed
my
face
against
the
smooth
cheeks
of
the
apples
still
warm
from
the
sun
and
skipped
back
to
the
house
our
favourite
walk
was
to
keller
landing
an
old
tumbledown
on
the
tennessee
river
used
during
the
civil
war
to
land
soldiers
there
we
spent
many
happy
hours
and
played
at
learning
geography
i
built
dams
of
pebbles
made
islands
and
lakes
and
dug
all
for
fun
and
never
dreamed
that
i
was
learning
a
lesson
i
listened
with
increasing
wonder
to
miss
sullivan
descriptions
of
the
great
round
world
with
its
burning
mountains
buried
cities
moving
rivers
of
ice
and
many
other
things
as
strange
she
made
raised
maps
in
clay
so
that
i
could
feel
the
mountain
ridges
and
valleys
and
follow
with
my
fingers
the
devious
course
of
rivers
i
liked
this
too
but
the
division
of
the
earth
into
zones
and
poles
confused
and
teased
my
mind
the
illustrative
strings
and
the
orange
stick
representing
the
poles
seemed
so
real
that
even
to
this
day
the
mere
mention
of
temperate
zone
suggests
a
series
of
twine
circles
and
i
believe
that
if
any
one
should
set
about
it
he
could
convince
me
that
white
bears
actually
climb
the
north
pole
arithmetic
seems
to
have
been
the
only
study
i
did
not
like
from
the
first
i
was
not
interested
in
the
science
of
numbers
miss
sullivan
tried
to
teach
me
to
count
by
stringing
beads
in
groups
and
by
arranging
kintergarten
straws
i
learned
to
add
and
subtract
i
never
had
patience
to
arrange
more
than
five
or
six
groups
at
a
time
when
i
had
accomplished
this
my
conscience
was
at
rest
for
the
day
and
i
went
out
quickly
to
find
my
playmates
in
this
same
leisurely
manner
i
studied
zoology
and
botany
once
a
gentleman
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
sent
me
a
collection
of
fossils
tiny
mollusk
shells
beautifully
marked
and
bits
of
sandstone
with
the
print
of
birds
claws
and
a
lovely
fern
in
these
were
the
keys
which
unlocked
the
treasures
of
the
antediluvian
world
for
me
with
trembling
fingers
i
listened
to
miss
sullivan
descriptions
of
the
terrible
beasts
with
uncouth
unpronounceable
names
which
once
went
tramping
through
the
primeval
forests
tearing
down
the
branches
of
gigantic
trees
for
food
and
died
in
the
dismal
swamps
of
an
unknown
age
for
a
long
time
these
strange
creatures
haunted
my
dreams
and
this
gloomy
period
formed
a
somber
background
to
the
joyous
now
filled
with
sunshine
and
roses
and
echoing
with
the
gentle
beat
of
my
pony
hoof
another
time
a
beautiful
shell
was
given
me
and
with
a
child
surprise
and
delight
i
learned
how
a
tiny
mollusk
had
built
the
lustrous
coil
for
his
dwelling
place
and
how
on
still
nights
when
there
is
no
breeze
stirring
the
waves
the
nautilus
sails
on
the
blue
waters
of
the
indian
ocean
in
his
ship
of
pearl
after
i
had
learned
a
great
many
interesting
things
about
the
life
and
habits
of
the
children
of
the
sea
how
in
the
midst
of
dashing
waves
the
little
polyps
build
the
beautiful
coral
isles
of
the
pacific
and
the
foraminifera
have
made
the
of
many
a
land
my
teacher
read
me
the
chambered
nautilus
and
showed
me
that
the
process
of
the
mollusks
is
symbolical
of
the
development
of
the
mind
just
as
the
mantle
of
the
nautilus
changes
the
material
it
absorbs
from
the
water
and
makes
it
a
part
of
itself
so
the
bits
of
knowledge
one
gathers
undergo
a
similar
change
and
become
pearls
of
thought
again
it
was
the
growth
of
a
plant
that
furnished
the
text
for
a
lesson
we
bought
a
lily
and
set
it
in
a
sunny
window
very
soon
the
green
pointed
buds
showed
signs
of
opening
the
slender
fingerlike
leaves
on
the
outside
opened
slowly
reluctant
i
thought
to
reveal
the
loveliness
they
hid
once
having
made
a
start
however
the
opening
process
went
on
rapidly
but
in
order
and
systematically
there
was
always
one
bud
larger
and
more
beautiful
than
the
rest
which
pushed
her
outer
covering
back
with
more
pomp
as
if
the
beauty
in
soft
silky
robes
knew
that
she
was
the
by
right
divine
while
her
more
timid
sisters
doffed
their
green
hoods
shyly
until
the
whole
plant
was
one
nodding
bough
of
loveliness
and
fragrance
once
there
were
eleven
tadpoles
in
a
glass
globe
set
in
a
window
full
of
plants
i
remember
the
eagerness
with
which
i
made
discoveries
about
them
it
was
great
fun
to
plunge
my
hand
into
the
bowl
and
feel
the
tadpoles
frisk
about
and
to
let
them
slip
and
slide
between
my
fingers
one
day
a
more
ambitious
fellow
leaped
beyond
the
edge
of
the
bowl
and
fell
on
the
floor
where
i
found
him
to
all
appearance
more
dead
than
alive
the
only
sign
of
life
was
a
slight
wriggling
of
his
tail
but
no
sooner
had
he
returned
to
his
element
than
he
darted
to
the
bottom
swimming
round
and
round
in
joyous
activity
he
had
made
his
leap
he
had
seen
the
great
world
and
was
content
to
stay
in
his
pretty
glass
house
under
the
big
fuchsia
tree
until
he
attained
the
dignity
of
froghood
then
he
went
to
live
in
the
leafy
pool
at
the
end
of
the
garden
where
he
made
the
summer
nights
musical
with
his
quaint
thus
i
learned
from
life
itself
at
the
beginning
i
was
only
a
little
mass
of
possibilities
it
was
my
teacher
who
unfolded
and
developed
them
when
she
came
everything
about
me
breathed
of
love
and
joy
and
was
full
of
meaning
she
has
never
since
let
pass
an
opportunity
to
point
out
the
beauty
that
is
in
everything
nor
has
she
ceased
trying
in
thought
and
action
and
example
to
make
my
life
sweet
and
useful
it
was
my
teacher
genius
her
quick
sympathy
her
loving
tact
which
made
the
first
years
of
my
education
so
beautiful
it
was
because
she
seized
the
right
moment
to
impart
knowledge
that
made
it
so
pleasant
and
acceptable
to
me
she
realized
that
a
child
mind
is
like
a
shallow
brook
which
ripples
and
dances
merrily
over
the
stony
course
of
its
education
and
reflects
here
a
flower
there
a
bush
yonder
a
fleecy
cloud
and
she
attempted
to
guide
my
mind
on
its
way
knowing
that
like
a
brook
it
should
be
fed
by
mountain
streams
and
hidden
springs
until
it
broadened
out
into
a
deep
river
capable
of
reflecting
in
its
placid
surface
billowy
hills
the
luminous
shadows
of
trees
and
the
blue
heavens
as
well
as
the
sweet
face
of
a
little
flower
any
teacher
can
take
a
child
to
the
classroom
but
not
every
teacher
can
make
him
learn
he
will
not
work
joyously
unless
he
feels
that
liberty
is
his
whether
he
is
busy
or
at
rest
he
must
feel
the
flush
of
victory
and
the
of
disappointment
before
he
takes
with
a
will
the
tasks
distasteful
to
him
and
resolves
to
dance
his
way
bravely
through
a
dull
routine
of
textbooks
my
teacher
is
so
near
to
me
that
i
scarcely
think
of
myself
apart
from
her
how
much
of
my
delight
in
all
beautiful
things
is
innate
and
how
much
is
due
to
her
influence
i
can
never
tell
i
feel
that
her
being
is
inseparable
from
my
own
and
that
the
footsteps
of
my
life
are
in
hers
all
the
best
of
me
belongs
to
her
there
is
not
a
talent
or
an
aspiration
or
a
joy
in
me
that
has
not
been
awakened
by
her
loving
touch
chapter
viii
the
first
christmas
after
miss
sullivan
came
to
tuscumbia
was
a
great
event
every
one
in
the
family
prepared
surprises
for
me
but
what
pleased
me
most
miss
sullivan
and
i
prepared
surprises
for
everybody
else
the
mystery
that
surrounded
the
gifts
was
my
greatest
delight
and
amusement
my
friends
did
all
they
could
to
excite
my
curiosity
by
hints
and
sentences
which
they
pretended
to
break
off
in
the
nick
of
time
miss
sullivan
and
i
kept
up
a
game
of
guessing
which
taught
me
more
about
the
use
of
language
than
any
set
lessons
could
have
done
every
evening
seated
round
a
glowing
wood
fire
we
played
our
guessing
game
which
grew
more
and
more
exciting
as
christmas
approached
on
christmas
eve
the
tuscumbia
schoolchildren
had
their
tree
to
which
they
invited
me
in
the
centre
of
the
schoolroom
stood
a
beautiful
tree
ablaze
and
shimmering
in
the
soft
light
its
branches
loaded
with
strange
wonderful
fruit
it
was
a
moment
of
supreme
happiness
i
danced
and
capered
round
the
tree
in
an
ecstasy
when
i
learned
that
there
was
a
gift
for
each
child
i
was
delighted
and
the
kind
people
who
had
prepared
the
tree
permitted
me
to
hand
the
presents
to
the
children
in
the
pleasure
of
doing
this
i
did
not
stop
to
look
at
my
own
gifts
but
when
i
was
ready
for
them
my
impatience
for
the
real
christmas
to
begin
almost
got
beyond
control
i
knew
the
gifts
i
already
had
were
not
those
of
which
friends
had
thrown
out
such
tantalizing
hints
and
my
teacher
said
the
presents
i
was
to
have
would
be
even
nicer
than
these
i
was
persuaded
however
to
content
myself
with
the
gifts
from
the
tree
and
leave
the
others
until
morning
that
night
after
i
had
hung
my
stocking
i
lay
awake
a
long
time
pretending
to
be
asleep
and
keeping
alert
to
see
what
santa
claus
would
do
when
he
came
at
last
i
fell
asleep
with
a
new
doll
and
a
white
bear
in
my
arms
next
morning
it
was
i
who
waked
the
whole
family
with
my
first
merry
christmas
i
found
surprises
not
in
the
stocking
only
but
on
the
table
on
all
the
chairs
at
the
door
on
the
very
indeed
i
could
hardly
walk
without
stumbling
on
a
bit
of
christmas
wrapped
up
in
tissue
paper
but
when
my
teacher
presented
me
with
a
canary
my
cup
of
happiness
overflowed
little
tim
was
so
tame
that
he
would
hop
on
my
finger
and
eat
candied
cherries
out
of
my
hand
miss
sullivan
taught
me
to
take
all
the
care
of
my
new
pet
every
morning
after
breakfast
i
prepared
his
bath
made
his
cage
clean
and
sweet
filled
his
cups
with
fresh
seed
and
water
from
the
and
hung
a
spray
of
chickweed
in
his
swing
one
morning
i
left
the
cage
on
the
while
i
went
to
fetch
water
for
his
bath
when
i
returned
i
felt
a
big
cat
brush
past
me
as
i
opened
the
door
at
first
i
did
not
realize
what
had
happened
but
when
i
put
my
hand
in
the
cage
and
tim
pretty
wings
did
not
meet
my
touch
or
his
small
pointed
claws
take
hold
of
my
finger
i
knew
that
i
should
never
see
my
sweet
little
singer
again
chapter
ix
the
next
important
event
in
my
life
was
my
visit
to
boston
in
may
as
if
it
were
yesterday
i
remember
the
preparations
the
departure
with
my
teacher
and
my
mother
the
journey
and
finally
the
arrival
in
boston
how
different
this
journey
was
from
the
one
i
had
made
to
baltimore
two
years
before
i
was
no
longer
a
restless
excitable
little
creature
requiring
the
attention
of
everybody
on
the
train
to
keep
me
amused
i
sat
quietly
beside
miss
sullivan
taking
in
with
eager
interest
all
that
she
told
me
about
what
she
saw
out
of
the
car
window
the
beautiful
tennessee
river
the
great
the
hills
and
woods
and
the
crowds
of
laughing
negroes
at
the
stations
who
waved
to
the
people
on
the
train
and
brought
delicious
candy
and
popcorn
balls
through
the
car
on
the
seat
opposite
me
sat
my
big
rag
doll
nancy
in
a
new
gingham
dress
and
a
beruffled
sunbonnet
looking
at
me
out
of
two
bead
eyes
sometimes
when
i
was
not
absorbed
in
miss
descriptions
i
remembered
nancy
existence
and
took
her
up
in
my
arms
but
i
generally
calmed
my
conscience
by
making
myself
believe
that
she
was
asleep
as
i
shall
not
have
occasion
to
refer
to
nancy
again
i
wish
to
tell
here
a
sad
experience
she
had
soon
after
our
arrival
in
boston
she
was
covered
with
dirt
the
remains
of
mud
pies
i
had
compelled
her
to
eat
although
she
had
never
shown
any
special
liking
for
them
the
laundress
at
the
perkins
institution
secretly
carried
her
off
to
give
her
a
bath
this
was
too
much
for
poor
nancy
when
i
next
saw
her
she
was
a
formless
heap
of
cotton
which
i
should
not
have
recognized
at
all
except
for
the
two
bead
eyes
which
looked
out
at
me
reproachfully
when
the
train
at
last
pulled
into
the
station
at
boston
it
was
as
if
a
beautiful
fairy
tale
had
come
true
the
once
upon
a
time
was
now
the
country
was
here
we
had
scarcely
arrived
at
the
perkins
institution
for
the
blind
when
i
began
to
make
friends
with
the
little
blind
children
it
delighted
me
inexpressibly
to
find
that
they
knew
the
manual
alphabet
what
joy
to
talk
with
other
children
in
my
own
language
until
then
i
had
been
like
a
foreigner
speaking
through
an
interpreter
in
the
school
where
laura
bridgman
was
taught
i
was
in
my
own
country
it
took
me
some
time
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
my
new
friends
were
blind
i
knew
i
could
not
see
but
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
all
the
eager
loving
children
who
gathered
round
me
and
joined
heartily
in
my
frolics
were
also
blind
i
remember
the
surprise
and
the
pain
i
felt
as
i
noticed
that
they
placed
their
hands
over
mine
when
i
talked
to
them
and
that
they
read
books
with
their
fingers
although
i
had
been
told
this
before
and
although
i
understood
my
own
deprivations
yet
i
had
thought
vaguely
that
since
they
could
hear
they
must
have
a
sort
of
second
sight
and
i
was
not
prepared
to
find
one
child
and
another
and
yet
another
deprived
of
the
same
precious
gift
but
they
were
so
happy
and
contented
that
i
lost
all
sense
of
pain
in
the
pleasure
of
their
companionship
one
day
spent
with
the
blind
children
made
me
feel
thoroughly
at
home
in
my
new
environment
and
i
looked
eagerly
from
one
pleasant
experience
to
another
as
the
days
flew
swiftly
by
i
could
not
quite
convince
myself
that
there
was
much
world
left
for
i
regarded
boston
as
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
creation
while
we
were
in
boston
we
visited
bunker
hill
and
there
i
had
my
first
lesson
in
history
the
story
of
the
brave
men
who
had
fought
on
the
spot
where
we
stood
excited
me
greatly
i
climbed
the
monument
counting
the
steps
and
wondering
as
i
went
higher
and
yet
higher
if
the
soldiers
had
climbed
this
great
stairway
and
shot
at
the
enemy
on
the
ground
below
the
next
day
we
went
to
plymouth
by
water
this
was
my
first
trip
on
the
ocean
and
my
first
voyage
in
a
steamboat
how
full
of
life
and
motion
it
was
but
the
rumble
of
the
machinery
made
me
think
it
was
thundering
and
i
began
to
cry
because
i
feared
if
it
rained
we
should
not
be
able
to
have
our
picnic
out
of
doors
i
was
more
interested
i
think
in
the
great
rock
on
which
the
pilgrims
landed
than
in
anything
else
in
plymouth
i
could
touch
it
and
perhaps
that
made
the
coming
of
the
pilgrims
and
their
toils
and
great
deeds
seem
more
real
to
me
i
have
often
held
in
my
hand
a
little
model
of
the
plymouth
rock
which
a
kind
gentleman
gave
me
at
pilgrim
hall
and
i
have
fingered
its
curves
the
split
in
the
centre
and
the
embossed
figures
and
turned
over
in
my
mind
all
that
i
knew
about
the
wonderful
story
of
the
pilgrims
how
my
childish
imagination
glowed
with
the
splendour
of
their
enterprise
i
idealized
them
as
the
bravest
and
most
generous
men
that
ever
sought
a
home
in
a
strange
land
i
thought
they
desired
the
freedom
of
their
fellow
men
as
well
as
their
own
i
was
keenly
surprised
and
disappointed
years
later
to
learn
of
their
acts
of
persecution
that
make
us
tingle
with
shame
even
while
we
glory
in
the
courage
and
energy
that
gave
us
our
country
beautiful
among
the
many
friends
i
made
in
boston
were
william
endicott
and
his
daughter
their
kindness
to
me
was
the
seed
from
which
many
pleasant
memories
have
since
grown
one
day
we
visited
their
beautiful
home
at
beverly
farms
i
remember
with
delight
how
i
went
through
their
how
their
dogs
big
leo
and
little
fritz
with
long
ears
came
to
meet
me
and
how
nimrod
the
swiftest
of
the
horses
poked
his
nose
into
my
hands
for
a
pat
and
a
lump
of
sugar
i
also
remember
the
beach
where
for
the
first
time
i
played
in
the
sand
it
was
hard
smooth
sand
very
different
from
the
loose
sharp
sand
mingled
with
kelp
and
shells
at
brewster
endicott
told
me
about
the
great
ships
that
came
sailing
by
from
boston
bound
for
europe
i
saw
him
many
times
after
that
and
he
was
always
a
good
friend
to
me
indeed
i
was
thinking
of
him
when
i
called
boston
the
city
of
kind
hearts
chapter
x
just
before
the
perkins
institution
closed
for
the
summer
it
was
arranged
that
my
teacher
and
i
should
spend
our
vacation
at
brewster
on
cape
cod
with
our
dear
friend
hopkins
i
was
delighted
for
my
mind
was
full
of
the
prospective
joys
and
of
the
wonderful
stories
i
had
heard
about
the
sea
my
most
vivid
recollection
of
that
summer
is
the
ocean
i
had
always
lived
far
inland
and
had
never
had
so
much
as
a
whiff
of
salt
air
but
i
had
read
in
a
big
book
called
our
world
a
description
of
the
ocean
which
filled
me
with
wonder
and
an
intense
longing
to
touch
the
mighty
sea
and
feel
it
roar
so
my
little
heart
leaped
high
with
eager
excitement
when
i
knew
that
my
wish
was
at
last
to
be
realized
no
sooner
had
i
been
helped
into
my
than
i
sprang
out
upon
the
warm
sand
and
without
thought
of
fear
plunged
into
the
cool
water
i
felt
the
great
billows
rock
and
sink
the
buoyant
motion
of
the
water
filled
me
with
an
exquisite
quivering
joy
suddenly
my
ecstasy
gave
place
to
terror
for
my
foot
struck
against
a
rock
and
the
next
instant
there
was
a
rush
of
water
over
my
head
i
thrust
out
my
hands
to
grasp
some
support
i
clutched
at
the
water
and
at
the
seaweed
which
the
waves
tossed
in
my
face
but
all
my
frantic
efforts
were
in
vain
the
waves
seemed
to
be
playing
a
game
with
me
and
tossed
me
from
one
to
another
in
their
wild
frolic
it
was
fearful
the
good
firm
earth
had
slipped
from
my
feet
and
everything
seemed
shut
out
from
this
strange
element
life
air
warmth
and
love
at
last
however
the
sea
as
if
weary
of
its
new
toy
threw
me
back
on
the
shore
and
in
another
instant
i
was
clasped
in
my
teacher
arms
oh
the
comfort
of
the
long
tender
embrace
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
from
my
panic
sufficiently
to
say
anything
i
demanded
who
put
salt
in
the
water
after
i
had
recovered
from
my
first
experience
in
the
water
i
thought
it
great
fun
to
sit
on
a
big
rock
in
my
and
feel
wave
after
wave
dash
against
the
rock
sending
up
a
shower
of
spray
which
quite
covered
me
i
felt
the
pebbles
rattling
as
the
waves
threw
their
ponderous
weight
against
the
shore
the
whole
beach
seemed
racked
by
their
terrific
onset
and
the
air
throbbed
with
their
pulsations
the
breakers
would
swoop
back
to
gather
themselves
for
a
mightier
leap
and
i
clung
to
the
rock
tense
fascinated
as
i
felt
the
dash
and
roar
of
the
rushing
sea
i
could
never
stay
long
enough
on
the
shore
the
tang
of
the
untainted
fresh
and
free
sea
air
was
like
a
cool
quieting
thought
and
the
shells
and
pebbles
and
the
seaweed
with
tiny
living
creatures
attached
to
it
never
lost
their
fascination
for
me
one
day
miss
sullivan
attracted
my
attention
to
a
strange
object
which
she
had
captured
basking
in
the
shallow
water
it
was
a
great
horseshoe
crab
the
first
one
i
had
ever
seen
i
felt
of
him
and
thought
it
very
strange
that
he
should
carry
his
house
on
his
back
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
make
a
delightful
pet
so
i
seized
him
by
the
tail
with
both
hands
and
carried
him
home
this
feat
pleased
me
highly
as
his
body
was
very
heavy
and
it
took
all
my
strength
to
drag
him
half
a
mile
i
would
not
leave
miss
sullivan
in
peace
until
she
had
put
the
crab
in
a
trough
near
the
well
where
i
was
confident
he
would
be
secure
but
next
morning
i
went
to
the
trough
and
lo
he
had
disappeared
nobody
knew
where
he
had
gone
or
how
he
had
escaped
my
disappointment
was
bitter
at
the
time
but
little
by
little
i
came
to
realize
that
it
was
not
kind
or
wise
to
force
this
poor
dumb
creature
out
of
his
element
and
after
awhile
i
felt
happy
in
the
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
returned
to
the
sea
chapter
xi
in
the
autumn
i
returned
to
my
southern
home
with
a
heart
full
of
joyous
memories
as
i
recall
that
visit
north
i
am
filled
with
wonder
at
the
richness
and
variety
of
the
experiences
that
cluster
about
it
it
seems
to
have
been
the
beginning
of
everything
the
treasures
of
a
new
beautiful
world
were
laid
at
my
feet
and
i
took
in
pleasure
and
information
at
every
turn
i
lived
myself
into
all
things
i
was
never
still
a
moment
my
life
was
as
full
of
motion
as
those
little
insects
that
crowd
a
whole
existence
into
one
brief
day
i
met
many
people
who
talked
with
me
by
spelling
into
my
hand
and
thought
in
joyous
sympathy
leaped
up
to
meet
thought
and
behold
a
miracle
had
been
wrought
the
barren
places
between
my
mind
and
the
minds
of
others
blossomed
like
the
rose
i
spent
the
autumn
months
with
my
family
at
our
summer
cottage
on
a
mountain
about
fourteen
miles
from
tuscumbia
it
was
called
fern
quarry
because
near
it
there
was
a
limestone
quarry
long
since
abandoned
three
frolicsome
little
streams
ran
through
it
from
springs
in
the
rocks
above
leaping
here
and
tumbling
there
in
laughing
cascades
wherever
the
rocks
tried
to
bar
their
way
the
opening
was
filled
with
ferns
which
completely
covered
the
beds
of
limestone
and
in
places
hid
the
streams
the
rest
of
the
mountain
was
thickly
wooded
here
were
great
oaks
and
splendid
evergreens
with
trunks
like
mossy
pillars
from
the
branches
of
which
hung
garlands
of
ivy
and
mistletoe
and
persimmon
trees
the
odour
of
which
pervaded
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
wood
an
illusive
fragrant
something
that
made
the
heart
glad
in
places
the
wild
muscadine
and
scuppernong
vines
stretched
from
tree
to
tree
making
arbours
which
were
always
full
of
butterflies
and
buzzing
insects
it
was
delightful
to
lose
ourselves
in
the
green
hollows
of
that
tangled
wood
in
the
late
afternoon
and
to
smell
the
cool
delicious
odours
that
came
up
from
the
earth
at
the
close
of
day
our
cottage
was
a
sort
of
rough
camp
beautifully
situated
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
among
oaks
and
pines
the
small
rooms
were
arranged
on
each
side
of
a
long
open
hall
round
the
house
was
a
wide
piazza
where
the
mountain
winds
blew
sweet
with
all
we
lived
on
the
piazza
most
of
the
time
there
we
worked
ate
and
played
at
the
back
door
there
was
a
great
butternut
tree
round
which
the
steps
had
been
built
and
in
front
the
trees
stood
so
close
that
i
could
touch
them
and
feel
the
wind
shake
their
branches
or
the
leaves
twirl
downward
in
the
autumn
blast
many
visitors
came
to
fern
quarry
in
the
evening
by
the
campfire
the
men
played
cards
and
whiled
away
the
hours
in
talk
and
sport
they
told
stories
of
their
wonderful
feats
with
fowl
fish
and
quadruped
how
many
wild
ducks
and
turkeys
they
had
shot
what
savage
trout
they
had
caught
and
how
they
had
bagged
the
craftiest
foxes
outwitted
the
most
clever
and
overtaken
the
fleetest
deer
until
i
thought
that
surely
the
lion
the
tiger
the
bear
and
the
rest
of
the
wild
tribe
would
not
be
able
to
stand
before
these
wily
hunters
to
the
chase
was
their
shout
as
the
circle
of
merry
friends
broke
up
for
the
night
the
men
slept
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
and
i
could
feel
the
deep
breathing
of
the
dogs
and
the
hunters
as
they
lay
on
their
improvised
beds
at
dawn
i
was
awakened
by
the
smell
of
coffee
the
rattling
of
guns
and
the
heavy
footsteps
of
the
men
as
they
strode
about
promising
themselves
the
greatest
luck
of
the
season
i
could
also
feel
the
stamping
of
the
horses
which
they
had
ridden
out
from
town
and
hitched
under
the
trees
where
they
stood
all
night
neighing
loudly
impatient
to
be
off
at
last
the
men
mounted
and
as
they
say
in
the
old
songs
away
went
the
steeds
with
bridles
ringing
and
whips
cracking
and
hounds
racing
ahead
and
away
went
the
champion
hunters
with
hark
and
whoop
and
wild
halloo
later
in
the
morning
we
made
preparations
for
a
barbecue
a
fire
was
kindled
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
hole
in
the
ground
big
sticks
were
laid
crosswise
at
the
top
and
meat
was
hung
from
them
and
turned
on
spits
around
the
fire
squatted
negroes
driving
away
the
flies
with
long
branches
the
savoury
odour
of
the
meat
made
me
hungry
long
before
the
tables
were
set
when
the
bustle
and
excitement
of
preparation
was
at
its
height
the
hunting
party
made
its
appearance
struggling
in
by
twos
and
threes
the
men
hot
and
weary
the
horses
covered
with
foam
and
the
jaded
hounds
panting
and
dejected
and
not
a
single
kill
every
man
declared
that
he
had
seen
at
least
one
deer
and
that
the
animal
had
come
very
close
but
however
hotly
the
dogs
might
pursue
the
game
however
well
the
guns
might
be
aimed
at
the
snap
of
the
trigger
there
was
not
a
deer
in
sight
they
had
been
as
fortunate
as
the
little
boy
who
said
he
came
very
near
seeing
a
rabbit
he
saw
his
tracks
the
party
soon
forgot
its
disappointment
however
and
we
sat
down
not
to
venison
but
to
a
tamer
feast
of
veal
and
roast
pig
one
summer
i
had
my
pony
at
fern
quarry
i
called
him
black
beauty
as
i
had
just
read
the
book
and
he
resembled
his
namesake
in
every
way
from
his
glossy
black
coat
to
the
white
star
on
his
forehead
i
spent
many
of
my
happiest
hours
on
his
back
occasionally
when
it
was
quite
safe
my
teacher
would
let
go
the
and
the
pony
sauntered
on
or
stopped
at
his
sweet
will
to
eat
grass
or
nibble
the
leaves
of
the
trees
that
grew
beside
the
narrow
trail
on
mornings
when
i
did
not
care
for
the
ride
my
teacher
and
i
would
start
after
breakfast
for
a
ramble
in
the
woods
and
allow
ourselves
to
get
lost
amid
the
trees
and
vines
with
no
road
to
follow
except
the
paths
made
by
cows
and
horses
frequently
we
came
upon
impassable
thickets
which
forced
us
to
take
a
round
about
way
we
always
returned
to
the
cottage
with
armfuls
of
laurel
goldenrod
ferns
and
gorgeous
such
as
grow
only
in
the
south
sometimes
i
would
go
with
mildred
and
my
little
cousins
to
gather
persimmons
i
did
not
eat
them
but
i
loved
their
fragrance
and
enjoyed
hunting
for
them
in
the
leaves
and
grass
we
also
went
nutting
and
i
helped
them
open
the
chestnut
burrs
and
break
the
shells
of
and
walnuts
the
big
sweet
walnuts
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
there
was
a
railroad
and
the
children
watched
the
trains
whiz
by
sometimes
a
terrific
whistle
brought
us
to
the
steps
and
mildred
told
me
in
great
excitement
that
a
cow
or
a
horse
had
strayed
on
the
track
about
a
mile
distant
there
was
a
trestle
spanning
a
deep
gorge
it
was
very
difficult
to
walk
over
the
ties
were
wide
apart
and
so
narrow
that
one
felt
as
if
one
were
walking
on
knives
i
had
never
crossed
it
until
one
day
mildred
miss
sullivan
and
i
were
lost
in
the
woods
and
wandered
for
hours
without
finding
a
path
suddenly
mildred
pointed
with
her
little
hand
and
exclaimed
the
trestle
we
would
have
taken
any
way
rather
than
this
but
it
was
late
and
growing
dark
and
the
trestle
was
a
short
cut
home
i
had
to
feel
for
the
rails
with
my
toe
but
i
was
not
afraid
and
got
on
very
well
until
all
at
once
there
came
a
faint
puff
puff
from
the
distance
i
see
the
train
cried
mildred
and
in
another
minute
it
would
have
been
upon
us
had
we
not
climbed
down
on
the
crossbraces
while
it
rushed
over
our
heads
i
felt
the
hot
breath
from
the
engine
on
my
face
and
the
smoke
and
ashes
almost
choked
us
as
the
train
rumbled
by
the
trestle
shook
and
swayed
until
i
thought
we
should
be
dashed
to
the
chasm
below
with
the
utmost
difficulty
we
regained
the
track
long
after
dark
we
reached
home
and
found
the
cottage
empty
the
family
were
all
out
hunting
for
us
chapter
xii
after
my
first
visit
to
boston
i
spent
almost
every
winter
in
the
north
once
i
went
on
a
visit
to
a
new
england
village
with
its
frozen
lakes
and
vast
snow
fields
it
was
then
that
i
had
opportunities
such
as
had
never
been
mine
to
enter
into
the
treasures
of
the
snow
i
recall
my
surprise
on
discovering
that
a
mysterious
hand
had
stripped
the
trees
and
bushes
leaving
only
here
and
there
a
wrinkled
leaf
the
birds
had
flown
and
their
empty
nests
in
the
bare
trees
were
filled
with
snow
winter
was
on
hill
and
field
the
earth
seemed
benumbed
by
his
icy
touch
and
the
very
spirits
of
the
trees
had
withdrawn
to
their
roots
and
there
curled
up
in
the
dark
lay
fast
asleep
all
life
seemed
to
have
ebbed
away
and
even
when
the
sun
shone
the
day
was
shrunk
and
cold
as
if
her
veins
were
sapless
and
old
and
she
rose
up
decrepitly
for
a
last
dim
look
at
earth
and
sea
the
withered
grass
and
the
bushes
were
transformed
into
a
forest
of
icicles
then
came
a
day
when
the
chill
air
portended
a
snowstorm
we
rushed
to
feel
the
first
few
tiny
flakes
descending
hour
by
hour
the
flakes
dropped
silently
softly
from
their
airy
height
to
the
earth
and
the
country
became
more
and
more
level
a
snowy
night
closed
upon
the
world
and
in
the
morning
one
could
scarcely
recognize
a
feature
of
the
landscape
all
the
roads
were
hidden
not
a
single
landmark
was
visible
only
a
waste
of
snow
with
trees
rising
out
of
it
in
the
evening
a
wind
from
the
northeast
sprang
up
and
the
flakes
rushed
hither
and
thither
in
furious
melee
around
the
great
fire
we
sat
and
told
merry
tales
and
frolicked
and
quite
forgot
that
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
desolate
solitude
shut
in
from
all
communication
with
the
outside
world
but
during
the
night
the
fury
of
the
wind
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
it
thrilled
us
with
a
vague
terror
the
rafters
creaked
and
strained
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
surrounding
the
house
rattled
and
beat
against
the
windows
as
the
winds
rioted
up
and
down
the
country
on
the
third
day
after
the
beginning
of
the
storm
the
snow
ceased
the
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
and
shone
upon
a
vast
undulating
white
plain
high
mounds
pyramids
heaped
in
fantastic
shapes
and
impenetrable
drifts
lay
scattered
in
every
direction
narrow
paths
were
shoveled
through
the
drifts
i
put
on
my
cloak
and
hood
and
went
out
the
air
stung
my
cheeks
like
fire
half
walking
in
the
paths
half
working
our
way
through
the
lesser
drifts
we
succeeded
in
reaching
a
pine
grove
just
outside
a
broad
pasture
the
trees
stood
motionless
and
white
like
figures
in
a
marble
frieze
there
was
no
odour
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
fell
upon
the
trees
so
that
the
twigs
sparkled
like
diamonds
and
dropped
in
showers
when
we
touched
them
so
dazzling
was
the
light
it
penetrated
even
the
darkness
that
veils
my
eyes
as
the
days
wore
on
the
drifts
gradually
shrunk
but
before
they
were
wholly
gone
another
storm
came
so
that
i
scarcely
felt
the
earth
under
my
feet
once
all
winter
at
intervals
the
trees
lost
their
icy
covering
and
the
bulrushes
and
underbrush
were
bare
but
the
lake
lay
frozen
and
hard
beneath
the
sun
our
favourite
amusement
during
that
winter
was
tobogganing
in
places
the
shore
of
the
lake
rises
abruptly
from
the
water
edge
down
these
steep
slopes
we
used
to
coast
we
would
get
on
our
toboggan
a
boy
would
give
us
a
shove
and
off
we
went
plunging
through
drifts
leaping
hollows
swooping
down
upon
the
lake
we
would
shoot
across
its
gleaming
surface
to
the
opposite
bank
what
joy
what
exhilarating
madness
for
one
wild
glad
moment
we
snapped
the
chain
that
binds
us
to
earth
and
joining
hands
with
the
winds
we
felt
ourselves
divine
chapter
xiii
it
was
in
the
spring
of
that
i
learned
to
speak
the
impulse
to
utter
audible
sounds
had
always
been
strong
within
me
i
used
to
make
noises
keeping
one
hand
on
my
throat
while
the
other
hand
felt
the
movements
of
my
lips
i
was
pleased
with
anything
that
made
a
noise
and
liked
to
feel
the
cat
purr
and
the
dog
bark
i
also
liked
to
keep
my
hand
on
a
singer
throat
or
on
a
piano
when
it
was
being
played
before
i
lost
my
sight
and
hearing
i
was
fast
learning
to
talk
but
after
my
illness
it
was
found
that
i
had
ceased
to
speak
because
i
could
not
hear
i
used
to
sit
in
my
mother
lap
all
day
long
and
keep
my
hands
on
her
face
because
it
amused
me
to
feel
the
motions
of
her
lips
and
i
moved
my
lips
too
although
i
had
forgotten
what
talking
was
my
friends
say
that
i
laughed
and
cried
naturally
and
for
awhile
i
made
many
sounds
and
not
because
they
were
a
means
of
communication
but
because
the
need
of
exercising
my
vocal
organs
was
imperative
there
was
however
one
word
the
meaning
of
which
i
still
remembered
water
i
pronounced
it
even
this
became
less
and
less
intelligible
until
the
time
when
miss
sullivan
began
to
teach
me
i
stopped
using
it
only
after
i
had
learned
to
spell
the
word
on
my
fingers
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
the
people
about
me
used
a
method
of
communication
different
from
mine
and
even
before
i
knew
that
a
deaf
child
could
be
taught
to
speak
i
was
conscious
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
means
of
communication
i
already
possessed
one
who
is
entirely
dependent
upon
the
manual
alphabet
has
always
a
sense
of
restraint
of
narrowness
this
feeling
began
to
agitate
me
with
a
vexing
sense
of
a
lack
that
should
be
filled
my
thoughts
would
often
rise
and
beat
up
like
birds
against
the
wind
and
i
persisted
in
using
my
lips
and
voice
friends
tried
to
discourage
this
tendency
fearing
lest
it
would
lead
to
disappointment
but
i
persisted
and
an
accident
soon
occurred
which
resulted
in
the
breaking
down
of
this
great
barrier
i
heard
the
story
of
ragnhild
kaata
in
lamson
who
had
been
one
of
laura
bridgman
teachers
and
who
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
norway
and
sweden
came
to
see
me
and
told
me
of
ragnhild
kaata
a
deaf
and
blind
girl
in
norway
who
had
actually
been
taught
to
speak
lamson
had
scarcely
finished
telling
me
about
this
girl
success
before
i
was
on
fire
with
eagerness
i
resolved
that
i
too
would
learn
to
speak
i
would
not
rest
satisfied
until
my
teacher
took
me
for
advice
and
assistance
to
miss
sarah
fuller
principal
of
the
horace
mann
school
this
lovely
lady
offered
to
teach
me
herself
and
we
began
the
of
march
miss
fuller
method
was
this
she
passed
my
hand
lightly
over
her
face
and
let
me
feel
the
position
of
her
tongue
and
lips
when
she
made
a
sound
i
was
eager
to
imitate
every
motion
and
in
an
hour
had
learned
six
elements
of
speech
m
p
a
s
t
i
miss
fuller
gave
me
eleven
lessons
in
all
i
shall
never
forget
the
surprise
and
delight
i
felt
when
i
uttered
my
first
connected
sentence
it
is
warm
true
they
were
broken
and
stammering
syllables
but
they
were
human
speech
my
soul
conscious
of
new
strength
came
out
of
bondage
and
was
reaching
through
those
broken
symbols
of
speech
to
all
knowledge
and
all
faith
no
deaf
child
who
has
earnestly
tried
to
speak
the
words
which
he
has
never
heard
to
come
out
of
the
prison
of
silence
where
no
tone
of
love
no
song
of
bird
no
strain
of
music
ever
pierces
the
stillness
can
forget
the
thrill
of
surprise
the
joy
of
discovery
which
came
over
him
when
he
uttered
his
first
word
only
such
a
one
can
appreciate
the
eagerness
with
which
i
talked
to
my
toys
to
stones
trees
birds
and
dumb
animals
or
the
delight
i
felt
when
at
my
call
mildred
ran
to
me
or
my
dogs
obeyed
my
commands
it
is
an
unspeakable
boon
to
me
to
be
able
to
speak
in
winged
words
that
need
no
interpretation
as
i
talked
happy
thoughts
fluttered
up
out
of
my
words
that
might
perhaps
have
struggled
in
vain
to
escape
my
fingers
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
could
really
talk
in
this
short
time
i
had
learned
only
the
elements
of
speech
miss
fuller
and
miss
sullivan
could
understand
me
but
most
people
would
not
have
understood
one
word
in
a
hundred
nor
is
it
true
that
after
i
had
learned
these
elements
i
did
the
rest
of
the
work
myself
but
for
miss
sullivan
genius
untiring
perseverance
and
devotion
i
could
not
have
progressed
as
far
as
i
have
toward
natural
speech
in
the
first
place
i
laboured
night
and
day
before
i
could
be
understood
even
by
my
most
intimate
friends
in
the
second
place
i
needed
miss
sullivan
assistance
constantly
in
my
efforts
to
articulate
each
sound
clearly
and
to
combine
all
sounds
in
a
thousand
ways
even
now
she
calls
my
attention
every
day
to
mispronounced
words
all
teachers
of
the
deaf
know
what
this
means
and
only
they
can
at
all
appreciate
the
peculiar
difficulties
with
which
i
had
to
contend
in
reading
my
teacher
lips
i
was
wholly
dependent
on
my
fingers
i
had
to
use
the
sense
of
touch
in
catching
the
vibrations
of
the
throat
the
movements
of
the
mouth
and
the
expression
of
the
face
and
often
this
sense
was
at
fault
in
such
cases
i
was
forced
to
repeat
the
words
or
sentences
sometimes
for
hours
until
i
felt
the
proper
ring
in
my
own
voice
my
work
was
practice
practice
practice
discouragement
and
weariness
cast
me
down
frequently
but
the
next
moment
the
thought
that
i
should
soon
be
at
home
and
show
my
loved
ones
what
i
had
accomplished
spurred
me
on
and
i
eagerly
looked
forward
to
their
pleasure
in
my
achievement
my
little
sister
will
understand
me
now
was
a
thought
stronger
than
all
obstacles
i
used
to
repeat
ecstatically
i
am
not
dumb
now
i
could
not
be
despondent
while
i
anticipated
the
delight
of
talking
to
my
mother
and
reading
her
responses
from
her
lips
it
astonished
me
to
find
how
much
easier
it
is
to
talk
than
to
spell
with
the
fingers
and
i
discarded
the
manual
alphabet
as
a
medium
of
communication
on
my
part
but
miss
sullivan
and
a
few
friends
still
use
it
in
speaking
to
me
for
it
is
more
convenient
and
more
rapid
than
just
here
perhaps
i
had
better
explain
our
use
of
the
manual
alphabet
which
seems
to
puzzle
people
who
do
not
know
us
one
who
reads
or
talks
to
me
spells
with
his
hand
using
the
manual
alphabet
generally
employed
by
the
deaf
i
place
my
hand
on
the
hand
of
the
speaker
so
lightly
as
not
to
impede
its
movements
the
position
of
the
hand
is
as
easy
to
feel
as
it
is
to
see
i
do
not
feel
each
letter
any
more
than
you
see
each
letter
separately
when
you
read
constant
practice
makes
the
fingers
very
flexible
and
some
of
my
friends
spell
rapidly
about
as
fast
as
an
expert
writes
on
a
typewriter
the
mere
spelling
is
of
course
no
more
a
conscious
act
than
it
is
in
writing
when
i
had
made
speech
my
own
i
could
not
wait
to
go
home
at
last
the
happiest
of
happy
moments
arrived
i
had
made
my
homeward
journey
talking
constantly
to
miss
sullivan
not
for
the
sake
of
talking
but
determined
to
improve
to
the
last
minute
almost
before
i
knew
it
the
train
stopped
at
the
tuscumbia
station
and
there
on
the
platform
stood
the
whole
family
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
now
as
i
think
how
my
mother
pressed
me
close
to
her
speechless
and
trembling
with
delight
taking
in
every
syllable
that
i
spoke
while
little
mildred
seized
my
free
hand
and
kissed
it
and
danced
and
my
father
expressed
his
pride
and
affection
in
a
big
silence
it
was
as
if
isaiah
prophecy
had
been
fulfilled
in
me
the
mountains
and
the
hills
shall
break
forth
before
you
into
singing
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
clap
their
hands
chapter
xiv
the
winter
of
was
darkened
by
the
one
cloud
in
my
bright
sky
joy
deserted
my
heart
and
for
a
long
long
time
i
lived
in
doubt
anxiety
and
fear
books
lost
their
charm
for
me
and
even
now
the
thought
of
those
dreadful
days
chills
my
heart
a
little
story
called
the
frost
king
which
i
wrote
and
sent
to
anagnos
of
the
perkins
institution
for
the
blind
was
at
the
root
of
the
trouble
in
order
to
make
the
matter
clear
i
must
set
forth
the
facts
connected
with
this
episode
which
justice
to
my
teacher
and
to
myself
compels
me
to
relate
i
wrote
the
story
when
i
was
at
home
the
autumn
after
i
had
learned
to
speak
we
had
stayed
up
at
fern
quarry
later
than
usual
while
we
were
there
miss
sullivan
had
described
to
me
the
beauties
of
the
late
foliage
and
it
seems
that
her
descriptions
revived
the
memory
of
a
story
which
must
have
been
read
to
me
and
which
i
must
have
unconsciously
retained
i
thought
then
that
i
was
making
up
a
story
as
children
say
and
i
eagerly
sat
down
to
write
it
before
the
ideas
should
slip
from
me
my
thoughts
flowed
easily
i
felt
a
sense
of
joy
in
the
composition
words
and
images
came
tripping
to
my
finger
ends
and
as
i
thought
out
sentence
after
sentence
i
wrote
them
on
my
braille
slate
now
if
words
and
images
come
to
me
without
effort
it
is
a
pretty
sure
sign
that
they
are
not
the
offspring
of
my
own
mind
but
stray
waifs
that
i
regretfully
dismiss
at
that
time
i
eagerly
absorbed
everything
i
read
without
a
thought
of
authorship
and
even
now
i
can
not
be
quite
sure
of
the
boundary
line
between
my
ideas
and
those
i
find
in
books
i
suppose
that
is
because
so
many
of
my
impressions
come
to
me
through
the
medium
of
others
eyes
and
ears
when
the
story
was
finished
i
read
it
to
my
teacher
and
i
recall
now
vividly
the
pleasure
i
felt
in
the
more
beautiful
passages
and
my
annoyance
at
being
interrupted
to
have
the
pronunciation
of
a
word
corrected
at
dinner
it
was
read
to
the
assembled
family
who
were
surprised
that
i
could
write
so
well
some
one
asked
me
if
i
had
read
it
in
a
book
this
question
surprised
me
very
much
for
i
had
not
the
faintest
recollection
of
having
had
it
read
to
me
i
spoke
up
and
said
oh
no
it
is
my
story
and
i
have
written
it
for
mr
anagnos
accordingly
i
copied
the
story
and
sent
it
to
him
for
his
birthday
it
was
suggested
that
i
should
change
the
title
from
autumn
leaves
to
the
frost
king
which
i
did
i
carried
the
little
story
to
the
myself
feeling
as
if
i
were
walking
on
air
i
little
dreamed
how
cruelly
i
should
pay
for
that
birthday
gift
anagnos
was
delighted
with
the
frost
king
and
published
it
in
one
of
the
perkins
institution
reports
this
was
the
pinnacle
of
my
happiness
from
which
i
was
in
a
little
while
dashed
to
earth
i
had
been
in
boston
only
a
short
time
when
it
was
discovered
that
a
story
similar
to
the
frost
king
called
the
frost
fairies
by
miss
margaret
canby
had
appeared
before
i
was
born
in
a
book
called
birdie
and
his
friends
the
two
stories
were
so
much
alike
in
thought
and
language
that
it
was
evident
miss
canby
story
had
been
read
to
me
and
that
mine
was
a
plagiarism
it
was
difficult
to
make
me
understand
this
but
when
i
did
understand
i
was
astonished
and
grieved
no
child
ever
drank
deeper
of
the
cup
of
bitterness
than
i
did
i
had
disgraced
myself
i
had
brought
suspicion
upon
those
i
loved
best
and
yet
how
could
it
possibly
have
happened
i
racked
my
brain
until
i
was
weary
to
recall
anything
about
the
frost
that
i
had
read
before
i
wrote
the
frost
king
but
i
could
remember
nothing
except
the
common
reference
to
jack
frost
and
a
poem
for
children
the
freaks
of
the
frost
and
i
knew
i
had
not
used
that
in
my
composition
at
first
anagnos
though
deeply
troubled
seemed
to
believe
me
he
was
unusually
tender
and
kind
to
me
and
for
a
brief
space
the
shadow
lifted
to
please
him
i
tried
not
to
be
unhappy
and
to
make
myself
as
pretty
as
possible
for
the
celebration
of
washington
birthday
which
took
place
very
soon
after
i
received
the
sad
news
i
was
to
be
ceres
in
a
kind
of
masque
given
by
the
blind
girls
how
well
i
remember
the
graceful
draperies
that
enfolded
me
the
bright
autumn
leaves
that
wreathed
my
head
and
the
fruit
and
grain
at
my
feet
and
in
my
hands
and
beneath
all
the
piety
of
the
masque
the
oppressive
sense
of
coming
ill
that
made
my
heart
heavy
the
night
before
the
celebration
one
of
the
teachers
of
the
institution
had
asked
me
a
question
connected
with
the
frost
king
and
i
was
telling
her
that
miss
sullivan
had
talked
to
me
about
jack
frost
and
his
wonderful
works
something
i
said
made
her
think
she
detected
in
my
words
a
confession
that
i
did
remember
miss
canby
story
of
the
frost
fairies
and
she
laid
her
conclusions
before
anagnos
although
i
had
told
her
most
emphatically
that
she
was
mistaken
anagnos
who
loved
me
tenderly
thinking
that
he
had
been
deceived
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
pleadings
of
love
and
innocence
he
believed
or
at
least
suspected
that
miss
sullivan
and
i
had
deliberately
stolen
the
bright
thoughts
of
another
and
imposed
them
on
him
to
win
his
admiration
i
was
brought
before
a
court
of
investigation
composed
of
the
teachers
and
officers
of
the
institution
and
miss
sullivan
was
asked
to
leave
me
then
i
was
questioned
and
with
what
seemed
to
me
a
determination
on
the
part
of
my
judges
to
force
me
to
acknowledge
that
i
remembered
having
had
the
frost
fairies
read
to
me
i
felt
in
every
question
the
doubt
and
suspicion
that
was
in
their
minds
and
i
felt
too
that
a
loved
friend
was
looking
at
me
reproachfully
although
i
could
not
have
put
all
this
into
words
the
blood
pressed
about
my
thumping
heart
and
i
could
scarcely
speak
except
in
monosyllables
even
the
consciousness
that
it
was
only
a
dreadful
mistake
did
not
lessen
my
suffering
and
when
at
last
i
was
allowed
to
leave
the
room
i
was
dazed
and
did
not
notice
my
caresses
or
the
tender
words
of
my
friends
who
said
i
was
a
brave
little
girl
and
they
were
proud
of
me
as
i
lay
in
my
bed
that
night
i
wept
as
i
hope
few
children
have
wept
i
felt
so
cold
i
imagined
i
should
die
before
morning
and
the
thought
comforted
me
i
think
if
this
sorrow
had
come
to
me
when
i
was
older
it
would
have
broken
my
spirit
beyond
repairing
but
the
angel
of
forgetfulness
has
gathered
up
and
carried
away
much
of
the
misery
and
all
the
bitterness
of
those
sad
days
miss
sullivan
had
never
heard
of
the
frost
fairies
or
of
the
book
in
which
it
was
published
with
the
assistance
of
alexander
graham
bell
she
investigated
the
matter
carefully
and
at
last
it
came
out
that
sophia
hopkins
had
a
copy
of
miss
canby
birdie
and
his
friends
in
the
year
that
we
spent
the
summer
with
her
at
brewster
hopkins
was
unable
to
find
her
copy
but
she
has
told
me
that
at
that
time
while
miss
sullivan
was
away
on
a
vacation
she
tried
to
amuse
me
by
reading
from
various
books
and
although
she
could
not
remember
reading
the
frost
fairies
any
more
than
i
yet
she
felt
sure
that
birdie
and
his
friends
was
one
of
them
she
explained
the
disappearance
of
the
book
by
the
fact
that
she
had
a
short
time
before
sold
her
house
and
disposed
of
many
juvenile
books
such
as
old
schoolbooks
and
fairy
tales
and
that
birdie
and
his
friends
was
probably
among
them
the
stories
had
little
or
no
meaning
for
me
then
but
the
mere
spelling
of
the
strange
words
was
sufficient
to
amuse
a
little
child
who
could
do
almost
nothing
to
amuse
herself
and
although
i
do
not
recall
a
single
circumstance
connected
with
the
reading
of
the
stories
yet
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
i
made
a
great
effort
to
remember
the
words
with
the
intention
of
having
my
teacher
explain
them
when
she
returned
one
thing
is
certain
the
language
was
ineffaceably
stamped
upon
my
brain
though
for
a
long
time
no
one
knew
it
least
of
all
myself
when
miss
sullivan
came
back
i
did
not
speak
to
her
about
the
frost
fairies
probably
because
she
began
at
once
to
read
little
lord
fauntleroy
which
filled
my
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
but
the
fact
remains
that
miss
canby
story
was
read
to
me
once
and
that
long
after
i
had
forgotten
it
it
came
back
to
me
so
naturally
that
i
never
suspected
that
it
was
the
child
of
another
mind
in
my
trouble
i
received
many
messages
of
love
and
sympathy
all
the
friends
i
loved
best
except
one
have
remained
my
own
to
the
present
time
miss
canby
herself
wrote
kindly
some
day
you
will
write
a
great
story
out
of
your
own
head
that
will
be
a
comfort
and
help
to
many
but
this
kind
prophecy
has
never
been
fulfilled
i
have
never
played
with
words
again
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
game
indeed
i
have
ever
since
been
tortured
by
the
fear
that
what
i
write
is
not
my
own
for
a
long
time
when
i
wrote
a
letter
even
to
my
mother
i
was
seized
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
terror
and
i
would
spell
the
sentences
over
and
over
to
make
sure
that
i
had
not
read
them
in
a
book
had
it
not
been
for
the
persistent
encouragement
of
miss
sullivan
i
think
i
should
have
given
up
trying
to
write
altogether
i
have
read
the
frost
fairies
since
also
the
letters
i
wrote
in
which
i
used
other
ideas
of
miss
canby
i
find
in
one
of
them
a
letter
to
anagnos
dated
september
words
and
sentiments
exactly
like
those
of
the
book
at
the
time
i
was
writing
the
frost
king
and
this
letter
like
many
others
contains
phrases
which
show
that
my
mind
was
saturated
with
the
story
i
represent
my
teacher
as
saying
to
me
of
the
golden
autumn
leaves
yes
they
are
beautiful
enough
to
comfort
us
for
the
flight
of
summer
an
idea
direct
from
miss
canby
story
this
habit
of
assimilating
what
pleased
me
and
giving
it
out
again
as
my
own
appears
in
much
of
my
early
correspondence
and
my
first
attempts
at
writing
in
a
composition
which
i
wrote
about
the
old
cities
of
greece
and
italy
i
borrowed
my
glowing
descriptions
with
variations
from
sources
i
have
forgotten
i
knew
anagnos
great
love
of
antiquity
and
his
enthusiastic
appreciation
of
all
beautiful
sentiments
about
italy
and
greece
i
therefore
gathered
from
all
the
books
i
read
every
bit
of
poetry
or
of
history
that
i
thought
would
give
him
pleasure
anagnos
in
speaking
of
my
composition
on
the
cities
has
said
these
ideas
are
poetic
in
their
essence
but
i
do
not
understand
how
he
ever
thought
a
blind
and
deaf
child
of
eleven
could
have
invented
them
yet
i
can
not
think
that
because
i
did
not
originate
the
ideas
my
little
composition
is
therefore
quite
devoid
of
interest
it
shows
me
that
i
could
express
my
appreciation
of
beautiful
and
poetic
ideas
in
clear
and
animated
language
those
early
compositions
were
mental
gymnastics
i
was
learning
as
all
young
and
inexperienced
persons
learn
by
assimilation
and
imitation
to
put
ideas
into
words
everything
i
found
in
books
that
pleased
me
i
retained
in
my
memory
consciously
or
unconsciously
and
adapted
it
the
young
writer
as
stevenson
has
said
instinctively
tries
to
copy
whatever
seems
most
admirable
and
he
shifts
his
admiration
with
astonishing
versatility
it
is
only
after
years
of
this
sort
of
practice
that
even
great
men
have
learned
to
marshal
the
legion
of
words
which
come
thronging
through
every
byway
of
the
mind
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
yet
completed
this
process
it
is
certain
that
i
can
not
always
distinguish
my
own
thoughts
from
those
i
read
because
what
i
read
becomes
the
very
substance
and
texture
of
my
mind
consequently
in
nearly
all
that
i
write
i
produce
something
which
very
much
resembles
the
crazy
patchwork
i
used
to
make
when
i
first
learned
to
sew
this
patchwork
was
made
of
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
pretty
bits
of
silk
and
velvet
but
the
coarse
pieces
that
were
not
pleasant
to
touch
always
predominated
likewise
my
compositions
are
made
up
of
crude
notions
of
my
own
inlaid
with
the
brighter
thoughts
and
riper
opinions
of
the
authors
i
have
read
it
seems
to
me
that
the
great
difficulty
of
writing
is
to
make
the
language
of
the
educated
mind
express
our
confused
ideas
half
feelings
half
thoughts
when
we
are
little
more
than
bundles
of
instinctive
tendencies
trying
to
write
is
very
much
like
trying
to
put
a
chinese
puzzle
together
we
have
a
pattern
in
mind
which
we
wish
to
work
out
in
words
but
the
words
will
not
fit
the
spaces
or
if
they
do
they
will
not
match
the
design
but
we
keep
on
trying
because
we
know
that
others
have
succeeded
and
we
are
not
willing
to
acknowledge
defeat
there
is
no
way
to
become
original
except
to
be
born
so
says
stevenson
and
although
i
may
not
be
original
i
hope
sometime
to
outgrow
my
artificial
periwigged
compositions
then
perhaps
my
own
thoughts
and
experiences
will
come
to
the
surface
meanwhile
i
trust
and
hope
and
persevere
and
try
not
to
let
the
bitter
memory
of
the
frost
king
trammel
my
efforts
so
this
sad
experience
may
have
done
me
good
and
set
me
thinking
on
some
of
the
problems
of
composition
my
only
regret
is
that
it
resulted
in
the
loss
of
one
of
my
dearest
friends
anagnos
since
the
publication
of
the
story
of
my
life
in
the
ladies
home
journal
anagnos
has
made
a
statement
in
a
letter
to
macy
that
at
the
time
of
the
frost
king
matter
he
believed
i
was
innocent
he
says
the
court
of
investigation
before
which
i
was
brought
consisted
of
eight
people
four
blind
four
seeing
persons
four
of
them
he
says
thought
i
knew
that
miss
canby
story
had
been
read
to
me
and
the
others
did
not
hold
this
view
anagnos
states
that
he
cast
his
vote
with
those
who
were
favourable
to
me
but
however
the
case
may
have
been
with
whichever
side
he
may
have
cast
his
vote
when
i
went
into
the
room
where
anagnos
had
so
often
held
me
on
his
knee
and
forgetting
his
many
cares
had
shared
in
my
frolics
and
found
there
persons
who
seemed
to
doubt
me
i
felt
that
there
was
something
hostile
and
menacing
in
the
very
atmosphere
and
subsequent
events
have
borne
out
this
impression
for
two
years
he
seems
to
have
held
the
belief
that
miss
sullivan
and
i
were
innocent
then
he
evidently
retracted
his
favourable
judgment
why
i
do
not
know
nor
did
i
know
the
details
of
the
investigation
i
never
knew
even
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
court
who
did
not
speak
to
me
i
was
too
excited
to
notice
anything
too
frightened
to
ask
questions
indeed
i
could
scarcely
think
what
i
was
saying
or
what
was
being
said
to
me
i
have
given
this
account
of
the
frost
king
affair
because
it
was
important
in
my
life
and
education
and
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
misunderstanding
i
have
set
forth
all
the
facts
as
they
appear
to
me
without
a
thought
of
defending
myself
or
of
laying
blame
on
any
one
chapter
xv
the
summer
and
winter
following
the
frost
king
incident
i
spent
with
my
family
in
alabama
i
recall
with
delight
that
everything
had
budded
and
blossomed
i
was
happy
the
frost
king
was
forgotten
when
the
ground
was
strewn
with
the
crimson
and
golden
leaves
of
autumn
and
the
grapes
that
covered
the
arbour
at
the
end
of
the
garden
were
turning
golden
brown
in
the
sunshine
i
began
to
write
a
sketch
of
my
life
a
year
after
i
had
written
the
frost
king
i
was
still
excessively
scrupulous
about
everything
i
wrote
the
thought
that
what
i
wrote
might
not
be
absolutely
my
own
tormented
me
no
one
knew
of
these
fears
except
my
teacher
a
strange
sensitiveness
prevented
me
from
referring
to
the
frost
king
and
often
when
an
idea
flashed
out
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
would
spell
softly
to
her
i
am
not
sure
it
is
mine
at
other
times
in
the
midst
of
a
paragraph
i
was
writing
i
said
to
myself
suppose
it
should
be
found
that
all
this
was
written
by
some
one
long
ago
an
impish
fear
clutched
my
hand
so
that
i
could
not
write
any
more
that
day
and
even
now
i
sometimes
feel
the
same
uneasiness
and
disquietude
miss
sullivan
consoled
and
helped
me
in
every
way
she
could
think
of
but
the
terrible
experience
i
had
passed
through
left
a
lasting
impression
on
my
mind
the
significance
of
which
i
am
only
just
beginning
to
understand
it
was
with
the
hope
of
restoring
my
that
she
persuaded
me
to
write
for
the
youth
companion
a
brief
account
of
my
life
i
was
then
twelve
years
old
as
i
look
back
on
my
struggle
to
write
that
little
story
it
seems
to
me
that
i
must
have
had
a
prophetic
vision
of
the
good
that
would
come
of
the
undertaking
or
i
should
surely
have
failed
i
wrote
timidly
fearfully
but
resolutely
urged
on
by
my
teacher
who
knew
that
if
i
persevered
i
should
find
my
mental
foothold
again
and
get
a
grip
on
my
faculties
up
to
the
time
of
the
frost
king
episode
i
had
lived
the
unconscious
life
of
a
little
child
now
my
thoughts
were
turned
inward
and
i
beheld
things
invisible
gradually
i
emerged
from
the
penumbra
of
that
experience
with
a
mind
made
clearer
by
trial
and
with
a
truer
knowledge
of
life
the
chief
events
of
the
year
were
my
trip
to
washington
during
the
inauguration
of
president
cleveland
and
visits
to
niagara
and
the
world
fair
under
such
circumstances
my
studies
were
constantly
interrupted
and
often
put
aside
for
many
weeks
so
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
a
connected
account
of
them
we
went
to
niagara
in
march
it
is
difficult
to
describe
my
emotions
when
i
stood
on
the
point
which
overhangs
the
american
falls
and
felt
the
air
vibrate
and
the
earth
tremble
it
seems
strange
to
many
people
that
i
should
be
impressed
by
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
niagara
they
are
always
asking
what
does
this
beauty
or
that
music
mean
to
you
you
can
not
see
the
waves
rolling
up
the
beach
or
hear
their
roar
what
do
they
mean
to
you
in
the
most
evident
sense
they
mean
everything
i
can
not
fathom
or
define
their
meaning
any
more
than
i
can
fathom
or
define
love
or
religion
or
goodness
during
the
summer
of
miss
sullivan
and
i
visited
the
world
fair
with
alexander
graham
bell
i
recall
with
unmixed
delight
those
days
when
a
thousand
childish
fancies
became
beautiful
realities
every
day
in
imagination
i
made
a
trip
round
the
world
and
i
saw
many
wonders
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
marvels
of
invention
treasuries
of
industry
and
skill
and
all
the
activities
of
human
life
actually
passed
under
my
finger
tips
i
liked
to
visit
the
midway
plaisance
it
seemed
like
the
arabian
nights
it
was
crammed
so
full
of
novelty
and
interest
here
was
the
india
of
my
books
in
the
curious
bazaar
with
its
shivas
and
there
was
the
land
of
the
pyramids
concentrated
in
a
model
cairo
with
its
mosques
and
its
long
processions
of
camels
yonder
were
the
lagoons
of
venice
where
we
sailed
every
evening
when
the
city
and
the
fountains
were
illuminated
i
also
went
on
board
a
viking
ship
which
lay
a
short
distance
from
the
little
craft
i
had
been
on
a
before
in
boston
and
it
interested
me
to
see
on
this
viking
ship
how
the
seaman
was
once
all
in
all
how
he
sailed
and
took
storm
and
calm
alike
with
undaunted
heart
and
gave
chase
to
whosoever
reechoed
his
cry
we
are
of
the
sea
and
fought
with
brains
and
sinews
instead
of
being
thrust
into
the
background
by
unintelligent
machinery
as
jack
is
so
it
always
is
man
only
is
interesting
to
man
at
a
little
distance
from
this
ship
there
was
a
model
of
the
santa
maria
which
i
also
examined
the
captain
showed
me
columbus
cabin
and
the
desk
with
an
on
it
this
small
instrument
impressed
me
most
because
it
made
me
think
how
weary
the
heroic
navigator
must
have
felt
as
he
saw
the
sand
dropping
grain
by
grain
while
desperate
men
were
plotting
against
his
life
higinbotham
president
of
the
world
fair
kindly
gave
me
permission
to
touch
the
exhibits
and
with
an
eagerness
as
insatiable
as
that
with
which
pizarro
seized
the
treasures
of
peru
i
took
in
the
glories
of
the
fair
with
my
fingers
it
was
a
sort
of
tangible
kaleidoscope
this
white
city
of
the
west
everything
fascinated
me
especially
the
french
bronzes
they
were
so
lifelike
i
thought
they
were
angel
visions
which
the
artist
had
caught
and
bound
in
earthly
forms
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
exhibit
i
learned
much
about
the
processes
of
mining
diamonds
whenever
it
was
possible
i
touched
the
machinery
while
it
was
in
motion
so
as
to
get
a
clearer
idea
how
the
stones
were
weighed
cut
and
polished
i
searched
in
the
washings
for
a
diamond
and
found
it
myself
the
only
true
diamond
they
said
that
was
ever
found
in
the
united
states
bell
went
everywhere
with
us
and
in
his
own
delightful
way
described
to
me
the
objects
of
greatest
interest
in
the
electrical
building
we
examined
the
telephones
autophones
phonographs
and
other
inventions
and
he
made
me
understand
how
it
is
possible
to
send
a
message
on
wires
that
mock
space
and
outrun
time
and
like
prometheus
to
draw
fire
from
the
sky
we
also
visited
the
anthropological
department
and
i
was
much
interested
in
the
relics
of
ancient
mexico
in
the
rude
stone
implements
that
are
so
often
the
only
record
of
an
age
the
simple
monuments
of
nature
unlettered
children
so
i
thought
as
i
fingered
them
that
seem
bound
to
last
while
the
memorials
of
kings
and
sages
crumble
in
dust
away
and
in
the
egyptian
mummies
which
i
shrank
from
touching
from
these
relics
i
learned
more
about
the
progress
of
man
than
i
have
heard
or
read
since
all
these
experiences
added
a
great
many
new
terms
to
my
vocabulary
and
in
the
three
weeks
i
spent
at
the
fair
i
took
a
long
leap
from
the
little
child
interest
in
fairy
tales
and
toys
to
the
appreciation
of
the
real
and
the
earnest
in
the
workaday
world
chapter
xvi
before
october
i
had
studied
various
subjects
by
myself
in
a
more
or
less
desultory
manner
i
read
the
histories
of
greece
rome
and
the
united
states
i
had
a
french
grammar
in
raised
print
and
as
i
already
knew
some
french
i
often
amused
myself
by
composing
in
my
head
short
exercises
using
the
new
words
as
i
came
across
them
and
ignoring
rules
and
other
technicalities
as
much
as
possible
i
even
tried
without
aid
to
master
the
french
pronunciation
as
i
found
all
the
letters
and
sounds
described
in
the
book
of
course
this
was
tasking
slender
powers
for
great
ends
but
it
gave
me
something
to
do
on
a
rainy
day
and
i
acquired
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
french
to
read
with
pleasure
la
fontaine
fables
le
medecin
malgre
lui
and
passages
from
athalie
i
also
gave
considerable
time
to
the
improvement
of
my
speech
i
read
aloud
to
miss
sullivan
and
recited
passages
from
my
favourite
poets
which
i
had
committed
to
memory
she
corrected
my
pronunciation
and
helped
me
to
phrase
and
inflect
it
was
not
however
until
october
after
i
had
recovered
from
the
fatigue
and
excitement
of
my
visit
to
the
world
fair
that
i
began
to
have
lessons
in
special
subjects
at
fixed
hours
miss
sullivan
and
i
were
at
that
time
in
hulton
pennsylvania
visiting
the
family
of
william
wade
mr
irons
a
neighbour
of
theirs
was
a
good
latin
scholar
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
study
under
him
i
remember
him
as
a
man
of
rare
sweet
nature
and
of
wide
experience
he
taught
me
latin
grammar
principally
but
he
often
helped
me
in
arithmetic
which
i
found
as
troublesome
as
it
was
uninteresting
mr
irons
also
read
with
me
tennyson
in
memoriam
i
had
read
many
books
before
but
never
from
a
critical
point
of
view
i
learned
for
the
first
time
to
know
an
author
to
recognize
his
style
as
i
recognize
the
clasp
of
a
friend
hand
at
first
i
was
rather
unwilling
to
study
latin
grammar
it
seemed
absurd
to
waste
time
analyzing
every
word
i
came
across
noun
genitive
singular
feminine
when
its
meaning
was
quite
plain
i
thought
i
might
just
as
well
describe
my
pet
in
order
to
know
it
order
vertebrate
division
quadruped
class
mammalia
genus
felinus
species
cat
individual
tabby
but
as
i
got
deeper
into
the
subject
i
became
more
interested
and
the
beauty
of
the
language
delighted
me
i
often
amused
myself
by
reading
latin
passages
picking
up
words
i
understood
and
trying
to
make
sense
i
have
never
ceased
to
enjoy
this
pastime
there
is
nothing
more
beautiful
i
think
than
the
evanescent
fleeting
images
and
sentiments
presented
by
a
language
one
is
just
becoming
familiar
with
ideas
that
flit
across
the
mental
sky
shaped
and
tinted
by
capricious
fancy
miss
sullivan
sat
beside
me
at
my
lessons
spelling
into
my
hand
whatever
mr
irons
said
and
looking
up
new
words
for
me
i
was
just
beginning
to
read
caesar
gallic
war
when
i
went
to
my
home
in
alabama
chapter
xvii
in
the
summer
of
i
attended
the
meeting
at
chautauqua
of
the
american
association
to
promote
the
teaching
of
speech
to
the
deaf
there
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
go
to
the
school
for
the
deaf
in
new
york
city
i
went
there
in
october
accompanied
by
miss
sullivan
this
school
was
chosen
especially
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
highest
advantages
in
vocal
culture
and
training
in
in
addition
to
my
work
in
these
subjects
i
studied
during
the
two
years
i
was
in
the
school
arithmetic
physical
geography
french
and
german
miss
reamy
my
german
teacher
could
use
the
manual
alphabet
and
after
i
had
acquired
a
small
vocabulary
we
talked
together
in
german
whenever
we
had
a
chance
and
in
a
few
months
i
could
understand
almost
everything
she
said
before
the
end
of
the
first
year
i
read
wilhelm
tell
with
the
greatest
delight
indeed
i
think
i
made
more
progress
in
german
than
in
any
of
my
other
studies
i
found
french
much
more
difficult
i
studied
it
with
madame
olivier
a
french
lady
who
did
not
know
the
manual
alphabet
and
who
was
obliged
to
give
her
instruction
orally
i
could
not
read
her
lips
easily
so
my
progress
was
much
slower
than
in
german
i
managed
however
to
read
le
medecin
malgre
lui
again
it
was
very
amusing
but
i
did
not
like
it
nearly
so
well
as
wilhelm
tell
my
progress
in
and
speech
was
not
what
my
teachers
and
i
had
hoped
and
expected
it
would
be
it
was
my
ambition
to
speak
like
other
people
and
my
teachers
believed
that
this
could
be
accomplished
but
although
we
worked
hard
and
faithfully
yet
we
did
not
quite
reach
our
goal
i
suppose
we
aimed
too
high
and
disappointment
was
therefore
inevitable
i
still
regarded
arithmetic
as
a
system
of
pitfalls
i
hung
about
the
dangerous
frontier
of
guess
avoiding
with
infinite
trouble
to
myself
and
others
the
broad
valley
of
reason
when
i
was
not
guessing
i
was
jumping
at
conclusions
and
this
fault
in
addition
to
my
dullness
aggravated
my
difficulties
more
than
was
right
or
necessary
but
although
these
disappointments
caused
me
great
depression
at
times
i
pursued
my
other
studies
with
unflagging
interest
especially
physical
geography
it
was
a
joy
to
learn
the
secrets
of
nature
how
in
the
picturesque
language
of
the
old
testament
the
winds
are
made
to
blow
from
the
four
corners
of
the
heavens
how
the
vapours
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
how
rivers
are
cut
out
among
the
rocks
and
mountains
overturned
by
the
roots
and
in
what
ways
man
may
overcome
many
forces
mightier
than
himself
the
two
years
in
new
york
were
happy
ones
and
i
look
back
to
them
with
genuine
pleasure
i
remember
especially
the
walks
we
all
took
together
every
day
in
central
park
the
only
part
of
the
city
that
was
congenial
to
me
i
never
lost
a
jot
of
my
delight
in
this
great
park
i
loved
to
have
it
described
every
time
i
entered
it
for
it
was
beautiful
in
all
its
aspects
and
these
aspects
were
so
many
that
it
was
beautiful
in
a
different
way
each
day
of
the
nine
months
i
spent
in
new
york
in
the
spring
we
made
excursions
to
various
places
of
interest
we
sailed
on
the
hudson
river
and
wandered
about
on
its
green
banks
of
which
bryant
loved
to
sing
i
liked
the
simple
wild
grandeur
of
the
palisades
among
the
places
i
visited
were
west
point
tarrytown
the
home
of
washington
irving
where
i
walked
through
sleepy
hollow
the
teachers
at
the
school
were
always
planning
how
they
might
give
the
pupils
every
advantage
that
those
who
hear
enjoy
how
they
might
make
much
of
few
tendencies
and
passive
memories
in
the
cases
of
the
little
ones
and
lead
them
out
of
the
cramping
circumstances
in
which
their
lives
were
set
before
i
left
new
york
these
bright
days
were
darkened
by
the
greatest
sorrow
that
i
have
ever
borne
except
the
death
of
my
father
john
spaulding
of
boston
died
in
february
only
those
who
knew
and
loved
him
best
can
understand
what
his
friendship
meant
to
me
he
who
made
every
one
happy
in
a
beautiful
unobtrusive
way
was
most
kind
and
tender
to
miss
sullivan
and
me
so
long
as
we
felt
his
loving
presence
and
knew
that
he
took
a
watchful
interest
in
our
work
fraught
with
so
many
difficulties
we
could
not
be
discouraged
his
going
away
left
a
vacancy
in
our
lives
that
has
never
been
filled
chapter
xviii
in
october
i
entered
the
cambridge
school
for
young
ladies
to
be
prepared
for
radcliffe
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
visited
wellesley
and
surprised
my
friends
by
the
announcement
some
day
i
shall
go
to
college
but
i
shall
go
to
harvard
when
asked
why
i
would
not
go
to
wellesley
i
replied
that
there
were
only
girls
there
the
thought
of
going
to
college
took
root
in
my
heart
and
became
an
earnest
desire
which
impelled
me
to
enter
into
competition
for
a
degree
with
seeing
and
hearing
girls
in
the
face
of
the
strong
opposition
of
many
true
and
wise
friends
when
i
left
new
york
the
idea
had
become
a
fixed
purpose
and
it
was
decided
that
i
should
go
to
cambridge
this
was
the
nearest
approach
i
could
get
to
harvard
and
to
the
fulfillment
of
my
childish
declaration
at
the
cambridge
school
the
plan
was
to
have
miss
sullivan
attend
the
classes
with
me
and
interpret
to
me
the
instruction
given
of
course
my
instructors
had
had
no
experience
in
teaching
any
but
normal
pupils
and
my
only
means
of
conversing
with
them
was
reading
their
lips
my
studies
for
the
first
year
were
english
history
english
literature
german
latin
arithmetic
latin
composition
and
occasional
themes
until
then
i
had
never
taken
a
course
of
study
with
the
idea
of
preparing
for
college
but
i
had
been
well
drilled
in
english
by
miss
sullivan
and
it
soon
became
evident
to
my
teachers
that
i
needed
no
special
instruction
in
this
subject
beyond
a
critical
study
of
the
books
prescribed
by
the
college
i
had
had
moreover
a
good
start
in
french
and
received
six
months
instruction
in
latin
but
german
was
the
subject
with
which
i
was
most
familiar
in
spite
however
of
these
advantages
there
were
serious
drawbacks
to
my
progress
miss
sullivan
could
not
spell
out
in
my
hand
all
that
the
books
required
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
have
textbooks
embossed
in
time
to
be
of
use
to
me
although
my
friends
in
london
and
philadelphia
were
willing
to
hasten
the
work
for
a
while
indeed
i
had
to
copy
my
latin
in
braille
so
that
i
could
recite
with
the
other
girls
my
instructors
soon
became
sufficiently
familiar
with
my
imperfect
speech
to
answer
my
questions
readily
and
correct
mistakes
i
could
not
make
notes
in
class
or
write
exercises
but
i
wrote
all
my
compositions
and
translations
at
home
on
my
typewriter
each
day
miss
sullivan
went
to
the
classes
with
me
and
spelled
into
my
hand
with
infinite
patience
all
that
the
teachers
said
in
study
hours
she
had
to
look
up
new
words
for
me
and
read
and
reread
notes
and
books
i
did
not
have
in
raised
print
the
tedium
of
that
work
is
hard
to
conceive
frau
grote
my
german
teacher
and
gilman
the
principal
were
the
only
teachers
in
the
school
who
learned
the
finger
alphabet
to
give
me
instruction
no
one
realized
more
fully
than
dear
frau
grote
how
slow
and
inadequate
her
spelling
was
nevertheless
in
the
goodness
of
her
heart
she
laboriously
spelled
out
her
instructions
to
me
in
special
lessons
twice
a
week
to
give
miss
sullivan
a
little
rest
but
though
everybody
was
kind
and
ready
to
help
us
there
was
only
one
hand
that
could
turn
drudgery
into
pleasure
that
year
i
finished
arithmetic
reviewed
my
latin
grammar
and
read
three
chapters
of
caesar
gallic
war
in
german
i
read
partly
with
my
fingers
and
partly
with
miss
sullivan
assistance
schiller
lied
von
der
glocke
and
taucher
heine
harzreise
freytag
aus
dem
staat
friedrichs
des
grossen
riehl
fluch
der
schonheit
minna
von
barnhelm
and
goethe
aus
meinem
leben
i
took
the
greatest
delight
in
these
german
books
especially
schiller
wonderful
lyrics
the
history
of
frederick
the
great
magnificent
achievements
and
the
account
of
goethe
life
i
was
sorry
to
finish
die
harzreise
so
full
of
happy
witticisms
and
charming
descriptions
of
hills
streams
that
sing
and
ripple
in
the
sunshine
and
wild
regions
sacred
to
tradition
and
legend
the
gray
sisters
of
a
imaginative
age
descriptions
such
as
can
be
given
only
by
those
to
whom
nature
is
a
feeling
a
love
and
an
appetite
gilman
instructed
me
part
of
the
year
in
english
literature
we
read
together
as
you
like
it
burke
speech
on
conciliation
with
america
and
macaulay
life
of
samuel
johnson
gilman
broad
views
of
history
and
literature
and
his
clever
explanations
made
my
work
easier
and
pleasanter
than
it
could
have
been
had
i
only
read
notes
mechanically
with
the
necessarily
brief
explanations
given
in
the
classes
burke
speech
was
more
instructive
than
any
other
book
on
a
political
subject
that
i
had
ever
read
my
mind
stirred
with
the
stirring
times
and
the
characters
round
which
the
life
of
two
contending
nations
centred
seemed
to
move
right
before
me
i
wondered
more
and
more
while
burke
masterly
speech
rolled
on
in
mighty
surges
of
eloquence
how
it
was
that
king
george
and
his
ministers
could
have
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
his
warning
prophecy
of
our
victory
and
their
humiliation
then
i
entered
into
the
melancholy
details
of
the
relation
in
which
the
great
statesman
stood
to
his
party
and
to
the
representatives
of
the
people
i
thought
how
strange
it
was
that
such
precious
seeds
of
truth
and
wisdom
should
have
fallen
among
the
tares
of
ignorance
and
corruption
in
a
different
way
macaulay
life
of
samuel
johnson
was
interesting
my
heart
went
out
to
the
lonely
man
who
ate
the
bread
of
affliction
in
grub
street
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
toil
and
cruel
suffering
of
body
and
soul
always
had
a
kind
word
and
lent
a
helping
hand
to
the
poor
and
despised
i
rejoiced
over
all
his
successes
i
shut
my
eyes
to
his
faults
and
wondered
not
that
he
had
them
but
that
they
had
not
crushed
or
dwarfed
his
soul
but
in
spite
of
macaulay
brilliancy
and
his
admirable
faculty
of
making
the
commonplace
seem
fresh
and
picturesque
his
positiveness
wearied
me
at
times
and
his
frequent
sacrifices
of
truth
to
effect
kept
me
in
a
questioning
attitude
very
unlike
the
attitude
of
reverence
in
which
i
had
listened
to
the
demosthenes
of
great
britain
at
the
cambridge
school
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
enjoyed
the
companionship
of
seeing
and
hearing
girls
of
my
own
age
i
lived
with
several
others
in
one
of
the
pleasant
houses
connected
with
the
school
the
house
where
howells
used
to
live
and
we
all
had
the
advantage
of
home
life
i
joined
them
in
many
of
their
games
even
blind
buff
and
frolics
in
the
snow
i
took
long
walks
with
them
we
discussed
our
studies
and
read
aloud
the
things
that
interested
us
some
of
the
girls
learned
to
speak
to
me
so
that
miss
sullivan
did
not
have
to
repeat
their
conversation
at
christmas
my
mother
and
little
sister
spent
the
holidays
with
me
and
gilman
kindly
offered
to
let
mildred
study
in
his
school
so
mildred
stayed
with
me
in
cambridge
and
for
six
happy
months
we
were
hardly
ever
apart
it
makes
me
most
happy
to
remember
the
hours
we
spent
helping
each
other
in
study
and
sharing
our
recreation
together
i
took
my
preliminary
examinations
for
radcliffe
from
the
of
june
to
the
of
july
in
the
subjects
i
offered
were
elementary
and
advanced
german
french
latin
english
and
greek
and
roman
history
making
nine
hours
in
all
i
passed
in
everything
and
received
honours
in
german
and
english
perhaps
an
explanation
of
the
method
that
was
in
use
when
i
took
my
examinations
will
not
be
amiss
here
the
student
was
required
to
pass
in
sixteen
hours
twelve
hours
being
called
elementary
and
four
advanced
he
had
to
pass
five
hours
at
a
time
to
have
them
counted
the
examination
papers
were
given
out
at
nine
at
harvard
and
brought
to
radcliffe
by
a
special
messenger
each
candidate
was
known
not
by
his
name
but
by
a
number
i
was
no
but
as
i
had
to
use
a
typewriter
my
identity
could
not
be
concealed
it
was
thought
advisable
for
me
to
have
my
examinations
in
a
room
by
myself
because
the
noise
of
the
typewriter
might
disturb
the
other
girls
gilman
read
all
the
papers
to
me
by
means
of
the
manual
alphabet
a
man
was
placed
on
guard
at
the
door
to
prevent
interruption
the
first
day
i
had
german
gilman
sat
beside
me
and
read
the
paper
through
first
then
sentence
by
sentence
while
i
repeated
the
words
aloud
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
him
perfectly
the
papers
were
difficult
and
i
felt
very
anxious
as
i
wrote
out
my
answers
on
the
typewriter
gilman
spelled
to
me
what
i
had
written
and
i
made
such
changes
as
i
thought
necessary
and
he
inserted
them
i
wish
to
say
here
that
i
have
not
had
this
advantage
since
in
any
of
my
examinations
at
radcliffe
no
one
reads
the
papers
to
me
after
they
are
written
and
i
have
no
opportunity
to
correct
errors
unless
i
finish
before
the
time
is
up
in
that
case
i
correct
only
such
mistakes
as
i
can
recall
in
the
few
minutes
allowed
and
make
notes
of
these
corrections
at
the
end
of
my
paper
if
i
passed
with
higher
credit
in
the
preliminaries
than
in
the
finals
there
are
two
reasons
in
the
finals
no
one
read
my
work
over
to
me
and
in
the
preliminaries
i
offered
subjects
with
some
of
which
i
was
in
a
measure
familiar
before
my
work
in
the
cambridge
school
for
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
i
had
passed
examinations
in
english
history
french
and
german
which
gilman
gave
me
from
previous
harvard
papers
gilman
sent
my
written
work
to
the
examiners
with
a
certificate
that
i
candidate
no
had
written
the
papers
all
the
other
preliminary
examinations
were
conducted
in
the
same
manner
none
of
them
was
so
difficult
as
the
first
i
remember
that
the
day
the
latin
paper
was
brought
to
us
professor
schilling
came
in
and
informed
me
i
had
passed
satisfactorily
in
german
this
encouraged
me
greatly
and
i
sped
on
to
the
end
of
the
ordeal
with
a
light
heart
and
a
steady
hand
chapter
xix
when
i
began
my
second
year
at
the
gilman
school
i
was
full
of
hope
and
determination
to
succeed
but
during
the
first
few
weeks
i
was
confronted
with
unforeseen
difficulties
gilman
had
agreed
that
that
year
i
should
study
mathematics
principally
i
had
physics
algebra
geometry
astronomy
greek
and
latin
unfortunately
many
of
the
books
i
needed
had
not
been
embossed
in
time
for
me
to
begin
with
the
classes
and
i
lacked
important
apparatus
for
some
of
my
studies
the
classes
i
was
in
were
very
large
and
it
was
impossible
for
the
teachers
to
give
me
special
instruction
miss
sullivan
was
obliged
to
read
all
the
books
to
me
and
interpret
for
the
instructors
and
for
the
first
time
in
eleven
years
it
seemed
as
if
her
dear
hand
would
not
be
equal
to
the
task
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
write
algebra
and
geometry
in
class
and
solve
problems
in
physics
and
this
i
could
not
do
until
we
bought
a
braille
writer
by
means
of
which
i
could
put
down
the
steps
and
processes
of
my
work
i
could
not
follow
with
my
eyes
the
geometrical
figures
drawn
on
the
blackboard
and
my
only
means
of
getting
a
clear
idea
of
them
was
to
make
them
on
a
cushion
with
straight
and
curved
wires
which
had
bent
and
pointed
ends
i
had
to
carry
in
my
mind
as
keith
says
in
his
report
the
lettering
of
the
figures
the
hypothesis
and
conclusion
the
construction
and
the
process
of
the
proof
in
a
word
every
study
had
its
obstacles
sometimes
i
lost
all
courage
and
betrayed
my
feelings
in
a
way
i
am
ashamed
to
remember
especially
as
the
signs
of
my
trouble
were
afterward
used
against
miss
sullivan
the
only
person
of
all
the
kind
friends
i
had
there
who
could
make
the
crooked
straight
and
the
rough
places
smooth
little
by
little
however
my
difficulties
began
to
disappear
the
embossed
books
and
other
apparatus
arrived
and
i
threw
myself
into
the
work
with
renewed
confidence
algebra
and
geometry
were
the
only
studies
that
continued
to
defy
my
efforts
to
comprehend
them
as
i
have
said
before
i
had
no
aptitude
for
mathematics
the
different
points
were
not
explained
to
me
as
fully
as
i
wished
the
geometrical
diagrams
were
particularly
vexing
because
i
could
not
see
the
relation
of
the
different
parts
to
one
another
even
on
the
cushion
it
was
not
until
keith
taught
me
that
i
had
a
clear
idea
of
mathematics
i
was
beginning
to
overcome
these
difficulties
when
an
event
occurred
which
changed
everything
just
before
the
books
came
gilman
had
begun
to
remonstrate
with
miss
sullivan
on
the
ground
that
i
was
working
too
hard
and
in
spite
of
my
earnest
protestations
he
reduced
the
number
of
my
recitations
at
the
beginning
we
had
agreed
that
i
should
if
necessary
take
five
years
to
prepare
for
college
but
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
the
success
of
my
examinations
showed
miss
sullivan
miss
harbaugh
gilman
head
teacher
and
one
other
that
i
could
without
too
much
effort
complete
my
preparation
in
two
years
more
gilman
at
first
agreed
to
this
but
when
my
tasks
had
become
somewhat
perplexing
he
insisted
that
i
was
overworked
and
that
i
should
remain
at
his
school
three
years
longer
i
did
not
like
his
plan
for
i
wished
to
enter
college
with
my
class
on
the
seventeenth
of
november
i
was
not
very
well
and
did
not
go
to
school
although
miss
sullivan
knew
that
my
indisposition
was
not
serious
yet
gilman
on
hearing
of
it
declared
that
i
was
breaking
down
and
made
changes
in
my
studies
which
would
have
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
to
take
my
final
examinations
with
my
class
in
the
end
the
difference
of
opinion
between
gilman
and
miss
sullivan
resulted
in
my
mother
withdrawing
my
sister
mildred
and
me
from
the
cambridge
school
after
some
delay
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
continue
my
studies
under
a
tutor
merton
keith
of
cambridge
miss
sullivan
and
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
winter
with
our
friends
the
chamberlins
in
wrentham
miles
from
boston
from
february
to
july
keith
came
out
to
wrentham
twice
a
week
and
taught
me
algebra
geometry
greek
and
latin
miss
sullivan
interpreted
his
instruction
in
october
we
returned
to
boston
for
eight
months
keith
gave
me
lessons
five
times
a
week
in
periods
of
about
an
hour
he
explained
each
time
what
i
did
not
understand
in
the
previous
lesson
assigned
new
work
and
took
home
with
him
the
greek
exercises
which
i
had
written
during
the
week
on
my
typewriter
corrected
them
fully
and
returned
them
to
me
in
this
way
my
preparation
for
college
went
on
without
interruption
i
found
it
much
easier
and
pleasanter
to
be
taught
by
myself
than
to
receive
instruction
in
class
there
was
no
hurry
no
confusion
my
tutor
had
plenty
of
time
to
explain
what
i
did
not
understand
so
i
got
on
faster
and
did
better
work
than
i
ever
did
in
school
i
still
found
more
difficulty
in
mastering
problems
in
mathematics
than
i
did
in
any
other
of
my
studies
i
wish
algebra
and
geometry
had
been
half
as
easy
as
the
languages
and
literature
but
even
mathematics
keith
made
interesting
he
succeeded
in
whittling
problems
small
enough
to
get
through
my
brain
he
kept
my
mind
alert
and
eager
and
trained
it
to
reason
clearly
and
to
seek
conclusions
calmly
and
logically
instead
of
jumping
wildly
into
space
and
arriving
nowhere
he
was
always
gentle
and
forbearing
no
matter
how
dull
i
might
be
and
believe
me
my
stupidity
would
often
have
exhausted
the
patience
of
job
on
the
and
of
june
i
took
my
final
examinations
for
radcliffe
college
the
first
day
i
had
elementary
greek
and
advanced
latin
and
the
second
day
geometry
algebra
and
advanced
greek
the
college
authorities
did
not
allow
miss
sullivan
to
read
the
examination
papers
to
me
so
eugene
vining
one
of
the
instructors
at
the
perkins
institution
for
the
blind
was
employed
to
copy
the
papers
for
me
in
american
braille
vining
was
a
stranger
to
me
and
could
not
communicate
with
me
except
by
writing
braille
the
proctor
was
also
a
stranger
and
did
not
attempt
to
communicate
with
me
in
any
way
the
braille
worked
well
enough
in
the
languages
but
when
it
came
to
geometry
and
algebra
difficulties
arose
i
was
sorely
perplexed
and
felt
discouraged
wasting
much
precious
time
especially
in
algebra
it
is
true
that
i
was
familiar
with
all
literary
braille
in
common
use
in
this
country
english
american
and
new
york
point
but
the
various
signs
and
symbols
in
geometry
and
algebra
in
the
three
systems
are
very
different
and
i
had
used
only
the
english
braille
in
my
algebra
two
days
before
the
examinations
vining
sent
me
a
braille
copy
of
one
of
the
old
harvard
papers
in
algebra
to
my
dismay
i
found
that
it
was
in
the
american
notation
i
sat
down
immediately
and
wrote
to
vining
asking
him
to
explain
the
signs
i
received
another
paper
and
a
table
of
signs
by
return
mail
and
i
set
to
work
to
learn
the
notation
but
on
the
night
before
the
algebra
examination
while
i
was
struggling
over
some
very
complicated
examples
i
could
not
tell
the
combinations
of
bracket
brace
and
radical
both
keith
and
i
were
distressed
and
full
of
forebodings
for
the
morrow
but
we
went
over
to
the
college
a
little
before
the
examination
began
and
had
vining
explain
more
fully
the
american
symbols
in
geometry
my
chief
difficulty
was
that
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
read
the
propositions
in
line
print
or
to
have
them
spelled
into
my
hand
and
somehow
although
the
propositions
were
right
before
me
i
found
the
braille
confusing
and
could
not
fix
clearly
in
my
mind
what
i
was
reading
but
when
i
took
up
algebra
i
had
a
harder
time
still
the
signs
which
i
had
so
lately
learned
and
which
i
thought
i
knew
perplexed
me
besides
i
could
not
see
what
i
wrote
on
my
typewriter
i
had
always
done
my
work
in
braille
or
in
my
head
keith
had
relied
too
much
on
my
ability
to
solve
problems
mentally
and
had
not
trained
me
to
write
examination
papers
consequently
my
work
was
painfully
slow
and
i
had
to
read
the
examples
over
and
over
before
i
could
form
any
idea
of
what
i
was
required
to
do
indeed
i
am
not
sure
now
that
i
read
all
the
signs
correctly
i
found
it
very
hard
to
keep
my
wits
about
me
but
i
do
not
blame
any
one
the
administrative
board
of
radcliffe
did
not
realize
how
difficult
they
were
making
my
examinations
nor
did
they
understand
the
peculiar
difficulties
i
had
to
surmount
but
if
they
unintentionally
placed
obstacles
in
my
way
i
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
i
overcame
them
all
chapter
xx
the
struggle
for
admission
to
college
was
ended
and
i
could
now
enter
radcliffe
whenever
i
pleased
before
i
entered
college
however
it
was
thought
best
that
i
should
study
another
year
under
keith
it
was
not
therefore
until
the
fall
of
that
my
dream
of
going
to
college
was
realized
i
remember
my
first
day
at
radcliffe
it
was
a
day
full
of
interest
for
me
i
had
looked
forward
to
it
for
years
a
potent
force
within
me
stronger
than
the
persuasion
of
my
friends
stronger
even
than
the
pleadings
of
my
heart
had
impelled
me
to
try
my
strength
by
the
standards
of
those
who
see
and
hear
i
knew
that
there
were
obstacles
in
the
way
but
i
was
eager
to
overcome
them
i
had
taken
to
heart
the
words
of
the
wise
roman
who
said
to
be
banished
from
rome
is
but
to
live
outside
of
rome
debarred
from
the
great
highways
of
knowledge
i
was
compelled
to
make
the
journey
across
country
by
unfrequented
roads
that
was
all
and
i
knew
that
in
college
there
were
many
bypaths
where
i
could
touch
hands
with
girls
who
were
thinking
loving
and
struggling
like
me
i
began
my
studies
with
eagerness
before
me
i
saw
a
new
world
opening
in
beauty
and
light
and
i
felt
within
me
the
capacity
to
know
all
things
in
the
wonderland
of
mind
i
should
be
as
free
as
another
its
people
scenery
manners
joys
tragedies
should
be
living
tangible
interpreters
of
the
real
world
the
seemed
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
great
and
the
wise
and
i
thought
the
professors
were
the
embodiment
of
wisdom
if
i
have
since
learned
differently
i
am
not
going
to
tell
anybody
but
i
soon
discovered
that
college
was
not
quite
the
romantic
lyceum
i
had
imagined
many
of
the
dreams
that
had
delighted
my
young
inexperience
became
beautifully
less
and
faded
into
the
light
of
common
day
gradually
i
began
to
find
that
there
were
disadvantages
in
going
to
college
the
one
i
felt
and
still
feel
most
is
lack
of
time
i
used
to
have
time
to
think
to
reflect
my
mind
and
i
we
would
sit
together
of
an
evening
and
listen
to
the
inner
melodies
of
the
spirit
which
one
hears
only
in
leisure
moments
when
the
words
of
some
loved
poet
touch
a
deep
sweet
chord
in
the
soul
that
until
then
had
been
silent
but
in
college
there
is
no
time
to
commune
with
one
thoughts
one
goes
to
college
to
learn
it
seems
not
to
think
when
one
enters
the
portals
of
learning
one
leaves
the
dearest
pleasures
solitude
books
and
imagination
outside
with
the
whispering
pines
i
suppose
i
ought
to
find
some
comfort
in
the
thought
that
i
am
laying
up
treasures
for
future
enjoyment
but
i
am
improvident
enough
to
prefer
present
joy
to
hoarding
riches
against
a
rainy
day
my
studies
the
first
year
were
french
german
history
english
composition
and
english
literature
in
the
french
course
i
read
some
of
the
works
of
corneille
moliere
racine
alfred
de
musset
and
and
in
the
german
those
of
goethe
and
schiller
i
reviewed
rapidly
the
whole
period
of
history
from
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
to
the
eighteenth
century
and
in
english
literature
studied
critically
milton
poems
and
areopagitica
i
am
frequently
asked
how
i
overcome
the
peculiar
conditions
under
which
i
work
in
college
in
the
classroom
i
am
of
course
practically
alone
the
professor
is
as
remote
as
if
he
were
speaking
through
a
telephone
the
lectures
are
spelled
into
my
hand
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
much
of
the
individuality
of
the
lecturer
is
lost
to
me
in
the
effort
to
keep
in
the
race
the
words
rush
through
my
hand
like
hounds
in
pursuit
of
a
hare
which
they
often
miss
but
in
this
respect
i
do
not
think
i
am
much
worse
off
than
the
girls
who
take
notes
if
the
mind
is
occupied
with
the
mechanical
process
of
hearing
and
putting
words
on
paper
at
speed
i
should
not
think
one
could
pay
much
attention
to
the
subject
under
consideration
or
the
manner
in
which
it
is
presented
i
can
not
make
notes
during
the
lectures
because
my
hands
are
busy
listening
usually
i
jot
down
what
i
can
remember
of
them
when
i
get
home
i
write
the
exercises
daily
themes
criticisms
and
the
and
final
examinations
on
my
typewriter
so
that
the
professors
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
out
how
little
i
know
when
i
began
the
study
of
latin
prosody
i
devised
and
explained
to
my
professor
a
system
of
signs
indicating
the
different
meters
and
quantities
i
use
the
hammond
typewriter
i
have
tried
many
machines
and
i
find
the
hammond
is
the
best
adapted
to
the
peculiar
needs
of
my
work
with
this
machine
movable
type
shuttles
can
be
used
and
one
can
have
several
shuttles
each
with
a
different
set
of
characters
greek
french
or
mathematical
according
to
the
kind
of
writing
one
wishes
to
do
on
the
typewriter
without
it
i
doubt
if
i
could
go
to
college
very
few
of
the
books
required
in
the
various
courses
are
printed
for
the
blind
and
i
am
obliged
to
have
them
spelled
into
my
hand
consequently
i
need
more
time
to
prepare
my
lessons
than
other
girls
the
manual
part
takes
longer
and
i
have
perplexities
which
they
have
not
there
are
days
when
the
close
attention
i
must
give
to
details
chafes
my
spirit
and
the
thought
that
i
must
spend
hours
reading
a
few
chapters
while
in
the
world
without
other
girls
are
laughing
and
singing
and
dancing
makes
me
rebellious
but
i
soon
recover
my
buoyancy
and
laugh
the
discontent
out
of
my
heart
for
after
all
every
one
who
wishes
to
gain
true
knowledge
must
climb
the
hill
difficulty
alone
and
since
there
is
no
royal
road
to
the
summit
i
must
zigzag
it
in
my
own
way
i
slip
back
many
times
i
fall
i
stand
still
i
run
against
the
edge
of
hidden
obstacles
i
lose
my
temper
and
find
it
again
and
keep
it
better
i
trudge
on
i
gain
a
little
i
feel
encouraged
i
get
more
eager
and
climb
higher
and
begin
to
see
the
widening
horizon
every
struggle
is
a
victory
one
more
effort
and
i
reach
the
luminous
cloud
the
blue
depths
of
the
sky
the
uplands
of
my
desire
i
am
not
always
alone
however
in
these
struggles
william
wade
and
allen
principal
of
the
pennsylvania
institution
for
the
instruction
of
the
blind
get
for
me
many
of
the
books
i
need
in
raised
print
their
thoughtfulness
has
been
more
of
a
help
and
encouragement
to
me
than
they
can
ever
know
last
year
my
second
year
at
radcliffe
i
studied
english
composition
the
bible
as
english
composition
the
governments
of
america
and
europe
the
odes
of
horace
and
latin
comedy
the
class
in
composition
was
the
pleasantest
it
was
very
lively
the
lectures
were
always
interesting
vivacious
witty
for
the
instructor
charles
townsend
copeland
more
than
any
one
else
i
have
had
until
this
year
brings
before
you
literature
in
all
its
original
freshness
and
power
for
one
short
hour
you
are
permitted
to
drink
in
the
eternal
beauty
of
the
old
masters
without
needless
interpretation
or
exposition
you
revel
in
their
fine
thoughts
you
enjoy
with
all
your
soul
the
sweet
thunder
of
the
old
testament
forgetting
the
existence
of
jahweh
and
elohim
and
you
go
home
feeling
that
you
have
had
a
glimpse
of
that
perfection
in
which
spirit
and
form
dwell
in
immortal
harmony
truth
and
beauty
bearing
a
new
growth
on
the
ancient
stem
of
time
this
year
is
the
happiest
because
i
am
studying
subjects
that
especially
interest
me
economics
elizabethan
literature
shakespeare
under
professor
george
kittredge
and
the
history
of
philosophy
under
professor
josiah
royce
through
philosophy
one
enters
with
sympathy
of
comprehension
into
the
traditions
of
remote
ages
and
other
modes
of
thought
which
erewhile
seemed
alien
and
without
reason
but
college
is
not
the
universal
athens
i
thought
it
was
there
one
does
not
meet
the
great
and
the
wise
face
to
face
one
does
not
even
feel
their
living
touch
they
are
there
it
is
true
but
they
seem
mummified
we
must
extract
them
from
the
crannied
wall
of
learning
and
dissect
and
analyze
them
before
we
can
be
sure
that
we
have
a
milton
or
an
isaiah
and
not
merely
a
clever
imitation
many
scholars
forget
it
seems
to
me
that
our
enjoyment
of
the
great
works
of
literature
depends
more
upon
the
depth
of
our
sympathy
than
upon
our
understanding
the
trouble
is
that
very
few
of
their
laborious
explanations
stick
in
the
memory
the
mind
drops
them
as
a
branch
drops
its
overripe
fruit
it
is
possible
to
know
a
flower
root
and
stem
and
all
and
all
the
processes
of
growth
and
yet
to
have
no
appreciation
of
the
flower
fresh
bathed
in
dew
again
and
again
i
ask
impatiently
why
concern
myself
with
these
explanations
and
hypotheses
they
fly
hither
and
thither
in
my
thought
like
blind
birds
beating
the
air
with
ineffectual
wings
i
do
not
mean
to
object
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
famous
works
we
read
i
object
only
to
the
interminable
comments
and
bewildering
criticisms
that
teach
but
one
thing
there
are
as
many
opinions
as
there
are
men
but
when
a
great
scholar
like
professor
kittredge
interprets
what
the
master
said
it
is
as
if
new
sight
were
given
the
blind
he
brings
back
shakespeare
the
poet
there
are
however
times
when
i
long
to
sweep
away
half
the
things
i
am
expected
to
learn
for
the
overtaxed
mind
can
not
enjoy
the
treasure
it
has
secured
at
the
greatest
cost
it
is
impossible
i
think
to
read
in
one
day
four
or
five
different
books
in
different
languages
and
treating
of
widely
different
subjects
and
not
lose
sight
of
the
very
ends
for
which
one
reads
when
one
reads
hurriedly
and
nervously
having
in
mind
written
tests
and
examinations
one
brain
becomes
encumbered
with
a
lot
of
choice
for
which
there
seems
to
be
little
use
at
the
present
time
my
mind
is
so
full
of
heterogeneous
matter
that
i
almost
despair
of
ever
being
able
to
put
it
in
order
whenever
i
enter
the
region
that
was
the
kingdom
of
my
mind
i
feel
like
the
proverbial
bull
in
the
china
shop
a
thousand
odds
and
ends
of
knowledge
come
crashing
about
my
head
like
hailstones
and
when
i
try
to
escape
them
and
college
nixies
of
all
sorts
pursue
me
until
i
wish
oh
may
i
be
forgiven
the
wicked
wish
that
i
might
smash
the
idols
i
came
to
worship
but
the
examinations
are
the
chief
bugbears
of
my
college
life
although
i
have
faced
them
many
times
and
cast
them
down
and
made
them
bite
the
dust
yet
they
rise
again
and
menace
me
with
pale
looks
until
like
bob
acres
i
feel
my
courage
oozing
out
at
my
finger
ends
the
days
before
these
ordeals
take
place
are
spent
in
cramming
your
mind
with
mystic
formula
and
indigestible
dates
unpalatable
diets
until
you
wish
that
books
and
science
and
you
were
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
at
last
the
dreaded
hour
arrives
and
you
are
a
favoured
being
indeed
if
you
feel
prepared
and
are
able
at
the
right
time
to
call
to
your
standard
thoughts
that
will
aid
you
in
that
supreme
effort
it
happens
too
often
that
your
trumpet
call
is
unheeded
it
is
most
perplexing
and
exasperating
that
just
at
the
moment
when
you
need
your
memory
and
a
nice
sense
of
discrimination
these
faculties
take
to
themselves
wings
and
fly
away
the
facts
you
have
garnered
with
such
infinite
trouble
invariably
fail
you
at
a
pinch
give
a
brief
account
of
huss
and
his
work
huss
who
was
he
and
what
did
he
do
the
name
looks
strangely
familiar
you
ransack
your
budget
of
historic
facts
much
as
you
would
hunt
for
a
bit
of
silk
in
a
you
are
sure
it
is
somewhere
in
your
mind
near
the
top
you
saw
it
there
the
other
day
when
you
were
looking
up
the
beginnings
of
the
reformation
but
where
is
it
now
you
fish
out
all
manner
of
odds
and
ends
of
knowledge
revolutions
schisms
massacres
systems
of
government
but
huss
where
is
he
you
are
amazed
at
all
the
things
you
know
which
are
not
on
the
examination
paper
in
desperation
you
seize
the
budget
and
dump
everything
out
and
there
in
a
corner
is
your
man
serenely
brooding
on
his
own
private
thought
unconscious
of
the
catastrophe
which
he
has
brought
upon
you
just
then
the
proctor
informs
you
that
the
time
is
up
with
a
feeling
of
intense
disgust
you
kick
the
mass
of
rubbish
into
a
corner
and
go
home
your
head
full
of
revolutionary
schemes
to
abolish
the
divine
right
of
professors
to
ask
questions
without
the
consent
of
the
questioned
it
comes
over
me
that
in
the
last
two
or
three
pages
of
this
chapter
i
have
used
figures
which
will
turn
the
laugh
against
me
ah
here
they
are
the
mixed
metaphors
mocking
and
strutting
about
before
me
pointing
to
the
bull
in
the
china
shop
assailed
by
hailstones
and
the
bugbears
with
pale
looks
an
unanalyzed
species
let
them
mock
on
the
words
describe
so
exactly
the
atmosphere
of
jostling
tumbling
ideas
i
live
in
that
i
will
wink
at
them
for
once
and
put
on
a
deliberate
air
to
say
that
my
ideas
of
college
have
changed
while
my
days
at
radcliffe
were
still
in
the
future
they
were
encircled
with
a
halo
of
romance
which
they
have
lost
but
in
the
transition
from
romantic
to
actual
i
have
learned
many
things
i
should
never
have
known
had
i
not
tried
the
experiment
one
of
them
is
the
precious
science
of
patience
which
teaches
us
that
we
should
take
our
education
as
we
would
take
a
walk
in
the
country
leisurely
our
minds
hospitably
open
to
impressions
of
every
sort
such
knowledge
floods
the
soul
unseen
with
a
soundless
tidal
wave
of
deepening
thought
knowledge
is
power
rather
knowledge
is
happiness
because
to
have
knowledge
broad
deep
knowledge
is
to
know
true
ends
from
false
and
lofty
things
from
low
to
know
the
thoughts
and
deeds
that

progress
is
to
feel
the
great
of
humanity
through
the
centuries
and
if
one
does
not
feel
in
these
pulsations

must
indeed

to

of
life
chapter
xxi
i
have
thus
far
sketched
the
events
of
my
life
but
i
have
not
shown
how
much
i
have
depended
on
books
not
only
for
pleasure
and
for
the
wisdom
they
bring
to
all
who
read
but
also
for
that
knowledge
which
comes
to
others
through
their
eyes
and
their
ears
indeed
books
have
meant
so
much
more
in
my
education
than
in
that
of
others
that
i
shall
go
back
to
the
time
when
i
began
to
read
i
read
my
first
connected
story
in
may
when
i
was
seven
years
old
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
devoured
everything
in
the
shape
of
a
printed
page
that
has
come
within
the
reach
of
my
hungry
finger
tips
as
i
have
said
i
did
not
study
regularly
during
the
early
years
of
my
education
nor
did
i
read
according
to
rule
at
first
i
had
only
a
few
books
in
raised
print
readers
for
beginners
a
collection
of
stories
for
children
and
a
book
about
the
earth
called
our
world
i
think
that
was
all
but
i
read
them
over
and
over
until
the
words
were
so
worn
and
pressed
i
could
scarcely
make
them
out
sometimes
miss
sullivan
read
to
me
spelling
into
my
hand
little
stories
and
poems
that
she
knew
i
should
understand
but
i
preferred
reading
myself
to
being
read
to
because
i
liked
to
read
again
and
again
the
things
that
pleased
me
it
was
during
my
first
visit
to
boston
that
i
really
began
to
read
in
good
earnest
i
was
permitted
to
spend
a
part
of
each
day
in
the
institution
library
and
to
wander
from
bookcase
to
bookcase
and
take
down
whatever
book
my
fingers
lighted
upon
and
read
i
did
whether
i
understood
one
word
in
ten
or
two
words
on
a
page
the
words
themselves
fascinated
me
but
i
took
no
conscious
account
of
what
i
read
my
mind
must
however
have
been
very
impressionable
at
that
period
for
it
retained
many
words
and
whole
sentences
to
the
meaning
of
which
i
had
not
the
faintest
clue
and
afterward
when
i
began
to
talk
and
write
these
words
and
sentences
would
flash
out
quite
naturally
so
that
my
friends
wondered
at
the
richness
of
my
vocabulary
i
must
have
read
parts
of
many
books
in
those
early
days
i
think
i
never
read
any
one
book
through
and
a
great
deal
of
poetry
in
this
uncomprehending
way
until
i
discovered
little
lord
fauntleroy
which
was
the
first
book
of
any
consequence
i
read
understandingly
one
day
my
teacher
found
me
in
a
corner
of
the
library
poring
over
the
pages
of
the
scarlet
letter
i
was
then
about
eight
years
old
i
remember
she
asked
me
if
i
liked
little
pearl
and
explained
some
of
the
words
that
had
puzzled
me
then
she
told
me
that
she
had
a
beautiful
story
about
a
little
boy
which
she
was
sure
i
should
like
better
than
the
scarlet
letter
the
name
of
the
story
was
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
she
promised
to
read
it
to
me
the
following
summer
but
we
did
not
begin
the
story
until
august
the
first
few
weeks
of
my
stay
at
the
seashore
were
so
full
of
discoveries
and
excitement
that
i
forgot
the
very
existence
of
books
then
my
teacher
went
to
visit
some
friends
in
boston
leaving
me
for
a
short
time
when
she
returned
almost
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
begin
the
story
of
little
lord
fauntleroy
i
recall
distinctly
the
time
and
place
when
we
read
the
first
chapters
of
the
fascinating
child
story
it
was
a
warm
afternoon
in
august
we
were
sitting
together
in
a
hammock
which
swung
from
two
solemn
pines
at
a
short
distance
from
the
house
we
had
hurried
through
the
after
luncheon
in
order
that
we
might
have
as
long
an
afternoon
as
possible
for
the
story
as
we
hastened
through
the
long
grass
toward
the
hammock
the
grasshoppers
swarmed
about
us
and
fastened
themselves
on
our
clothes
and
i
remember
that
my
teacher
insisted
upon
picking
them
all
off
before
we
sat
down
which
seemed
to
me
an
unnecessary
waste
of
time
the
hammock
was
covered
with
pine
needles
for
it
had
not
been
used
while
my
teacher
was
away
the
warm
sun
shone
on
the
pine
trees
and
drew
out
all
their
fragrance
the
air
was
balmy
with
a
tang
of
the
sea
in
it
before
we
began
the
story
miss
sullivan
explained
to
me
the
things
that
she
knew
i
should
not
understand
and
as
we
read
on
she
explained
the
unfamiliar
words
at
first
there
were
many
words
i
did
not
know
and
the
reading
was
constantly
interrupted
but
as
soon
as
i
thoroughly
comprehended
the
situation
i
became
too
eagerly
absorbed
in
the
story
to
notice
mere
words
and
i
am
afraid
i
listened
impatiently
to
the
explanations
that
miss
sullivan
felt
to
be
necessary
when
her
fingers
were
too
tired
to
spell
another
word
i
had
for
the
first
time
a
keen
sense
of
my
deprivations
i
took
the
book
in
my
hands
and
tried
to
feel
the
letters
with
an
intensity
of
longing
that
i
can
never
forget
afterward
at
my
eager
request
anagnos
had
this
story
embossed
and
i
read
it
again
and
again
until
i
almost
knew
it
by
heart
and
all
through
my
childhood
little
lord
fauntleroy
was
my
sweet
and
gentle
companion
i
have
given
these
details
at
the
risk
of
being
tedious
because
they
are
in
such
vivid
contrast
with
my
vague
mutable
and
confused
memories
of
earlier
reading
from
little
lord
fauntleroy
i
date
the
beginning
of
my
true
interest
in
books
during
the
next
two
years
i
read
many
books
at
my
home
and
on
my
visits
to
boston
i
can
not
remember
what
they
all
were
or
in
what
order
i
read
them
but
i
know
that
among
them
were
greek
heroes
la
fontaine
fables
hawthorne
wonder
book
bible
stories
tales
from
shakespeare
a
child
history
of
england
by
dickens
the
arabian
nights
the
swiss
family
robinson
the
progress
robinson
crusoe
little
women
and
heidi
a
beautiful
little
story
which
i
afterward
read
in
german
i
read
them
in
the
intervals
between
study
and
play
with
an
sense
of
pleasure
i
did
not
study
nor
analyze
them
i
did
not
know
whether
they
were
well
written
or
not
i
never
thought
about
style
or
authorship
they
laid
their
treasures
at
my
feet
and
i
accepted
them
as
we
accept
the
sunshine
and
the
love
of
our
friends
i
loved
little
women
because
it
gave
me
a
sense
of
kinship
with
girls
and
boys
who
could
see
and
hear
circumscribed
as
my
life
was
in
so
many
ways
i
had
to
look
between
the
covers
of
books
for
news
of
the
world
that
lay
outside
my
own
i
did
not
care
especially
for
the
pilgrim
progress
which
i
think
i
did
not
finish
or
for
the
fables
i
read
la
fontaine
fables
first
in
an
english
translation
and
enjoyed
them
only
after
a
fashion
later
i
read
the
book
again
in
french
and
i
found
that
in
spite
of
the
vivid
and
the
wonderful
mastery
of
language
i
liked
it
no
better
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
but
stories
in
which
animals
are
made
to
talk
and
act
like
human
beings
have
never
appealed
to
me
very
strongly
the
ludicrous
caricatures
of
the
animals
occupy
my
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
the
moral
then
again
la
fontaine
seldom
if
ever
appeals
to
our
highest
moral
sense
the
highest
chords
he
strikes
are
those
of
reason
and
through
all
the
fables
runs
the
thought
that
man
morality
springs
wholly
from
and
that
if
that
is
directed
and
restrained
by
reason
happiness
must
follow
now
so
far
as
i
can
judge
is
the
root
of
all
evil
but
of
course
i
may
be
wrong
for
la
fontaine
had
greater
opportunities
of
observing
men
than
i
am
likely
ever
to
have
i
do
not
object
so
much
to
the
cynical
and
satirical
fables
as
to
those
in
which
momentous
truths
are
taught
by
monkeys
and
foxes
but
i
love
the
jungle
book
and
wild
animals
i
have
known
i
feel
a
genuine
interest
in
the
animals
themselves
because
they
are
real
animals
and
not
caricatures
of
men
one
sympathizes
with
their
loves
and
hatreds
laughs
over
their
comedies
and
weeps
over
their
tragedies
and
if
they
point
a
moral
it
is
so
subtle
that
we
are
not
conscious
of
it
my
mind
opened
naturally
and
joyously
to
a
conception
of
antiquity
greece
ancient
greece
exercised
a
mysterious
fascination
over
me
in
my
fancy
the
pagan
gods
and
goddesses
still
walked
on
earth
and
talked
face
to
face
with
men
and
in
my
heart
i
secretly
built
shrines
to
those
i
loved
best
i
knew
and
loved
the
whole
tribe
of
nymphs
and
heroes
and
demigods
no
not
quite
all
for
the
cruelty
and
greed
of
medea
and
jason
were
too
monstrous
to
be
forgiven
and
i
used
to
wonder
why
the
gods
permitted
them
to
do
wrong
and
then
punished
them
for
their
wickedness
and
the
mystery
is
still
unsolved
i
often
wonder
how
god
can
dumbness
keep
while
sin
creeps
grinning
through
his
house
of
time
it
was
the
iliad
that
made
greece
my
paradise
i
was
familiar
with
the
story
of
troy
before
i
read
it
in
the
original
and
consequently
i
had
little
difficulty
in
making
the
greek
words
surrender
their
treasures
after
i
had
passed
the
borderland
of
grammar
great
poetry
whether
written
in
greek
or
in
english
needs
no
other
interpreter
than
a
responsive
heart
would
that
the
host
of
those
who
make
the
great
works
of
the
poets
odious
by
their
analysis
impositions
and
laborious
comments
might
learn
this
simple
truth
it
is
not
necessary
that
one
should
be
able
to
define
every
word
and
give
it
its
principal
parts
and
its
grammatical
position
in
the
sentence
in
order
to
understand
and
appreciate
a
fine
poem
i
know
my
learned
professors
have
found
greater
riches
in
the
iliad
than
i
shall
ever
find
but
i
am
not
avaricious
i
am
content
that
others
should
be
wiser
than
i
but
with
all
their
wide
and
comprehensive
knowledge
they
can
not
measure
their
enjoyment
of
that
splendid
epic
nor
can
i
when
i
read
the
finest
passages
of
the
iliad
i
am
conscious
of
a
that
lifts
me
above
the
narrow
cramping
circumstances
of
my
life
my
physical
limitations
are
forgotten
my
world
lies
upward
the
length
and
the
breadth
and
the
sweep
of
the
heavens
are
mine
my
admiration
for
the
aeneid
is
not
so
great
but
it
is
none
the
less
real
i
read
it
as
much
as
possible
without
the
help
of
notes
or
dictionary
and
i
always
like
to
translate
the
episodes
that
please
me
especially
the
of
virgil
is
wonderful
sometimes
but
his
gods
and
men
move
through
the
scenes
of
passion
and
strife
and
pity
and
love
like
the
graceful
figures
in
an
elizabethan
mask
whereas
in
the
iliad
they
give
three
leaps
and
go
on
singing
virgil
is
serene
and
lovely
like
a
marble
apollo
in
the
moonlight
homer
is
a
beautiful
animated
youth
in
the
full
sunlight
with
the
wind
in
his
hair
how
easy
it
is
to
fly
on
paper
wings
from
greek
heroes
to
the
iliad
was
no
day
journey
nor
was
it
altogether
pleasant
one
could
have
traveled
round
the
word
many
times
while
i
trudged
my
weary
way
through
the
labyrinthine
mazes
of
grammars
and
dictionaries
or
fell
into
those
dreadful
pitfalls
called
examinations
set
by
schools
and
colleges
for
the
confusion
of
those
who
seek
after
knowledge
i
suppose
this
sort
of
pilgrim
progress
was
justified
by
the
end
but
it
seemed
interminable
to
me
in
spite
of
the
pleasant
surprises
that
met
me
now
and
then
at
a
turn
in
the
road
i
began
to
read
the
bible
long
before
i
could
understand
it
now
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
there
should
have
been
a
time
when
my
spirit
was
deaf
to
its
wondrous
harmonies
but
i
remember
well
a
rainy
sunday
morning
when
having
nothing
else
to
do
i
begged
my
cousin
to
read
me
a
story
out
of
the
bible
although
she
did
not
think
i
should
understand
she
began
to
spell
into
my
hand
the
story
of
joseph
and
his
brothers
somehow
it
failed
to
interest
me
the
unusual
language
and
repetition
made
the
story
seem
unreal
and
far
away
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
i
fell
asleep
and
wandered
off
to
the
land
of
nod
before
the
brothers
came
with
the
coat
of
many
colours
unto
the
tent
of
jacob
and
told
their
wicked
lie
i
can
not
understand
why
the
stories
of
the
greeks
should
have
been
so
full
of
charm
for
me
and
those
of
the
bible
so
devoid
of
interest
unless
it
was
that
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
greeks
in
boston
and
been
inspired
by
their
enthusiasm
for
the
stories
of
their
country
whereas
i
had
not
met
a
single
hebrew
or
egyptian
and
therefore
concluded
that
they
were
nothing
more
than
barbarians
and
the
stories
about
them
were
probably
all
made
up
which
hypothesis
explained
the
repetitions
and
the
queer
names
curiously
enough
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
call
greek
patronymics
queer
but
how
shall
i
speak
of
the
glories
i
have
since
discovered
in
the
bible
for
years
i
have
read
it
with
an
sense
of
joy
and
inspiration
and
i
love
it
as
i
love
no
other
book
still
there
is
much
in
the
bible
against
which
every
instinct
of
my
being
rebels
so
much
that
i
regret
the
necessity
which
has
compelled
me
to
read
it
through
from
beginning
to
end
i
do
not
think
that
the
knowledge
which
i
have
gained
of
its
history
and
sources
compensates
me
for
the
unpleasant
details
it
has
forced
upon
my
attention
for
my
part
i
wish
with
howells
that
the
literature
of
the
past
might
be
purged
of
all
that
is
ugly
and
barbarous
in
it
although
i
should
object
as
much
as
any
one
to
having
these
great
works
weakened
or
falsified
there
is
something
impressive
awful
in
the
simplicity
and
terrible
directness
of
the
book
of
esther
could
there
be
anything
more
dramatic
than
the
scene
in
which
esther
stands
before
her
wicked
lord
she
knows
her
life
is
in
his
hands
there
is
no
one
to
protect
her
from
his
wrath
yet
conquering
her
woman
fear
she
approaches
him
animated
by
the
noblest
patriotism
having
but
one
thought
if
i
perish
i
perish
but
if
i
live
my
people
shall
live
the
story
of
ruth
too
how
oriental
it
is
yet
how
different
is
the
life
of
these
simple
country
folks
from
that
of
the
persian
capital
ruth
is
so
loyal
and
we
can
not
help
loving
her
as
she
stands
with
the
reapers
amid
the
waving
corn
her
beautiful
unselfish
spirit
shines
out
like
a
bright
star
in
the
night
of
a
dark
and
cruel
age
love
like
ruth
love
which
can
rise
above
conflicting
creeds
and
racial
prejudices
is
hard
to
find
in
all
the
world
the
bible
gives
me
a
deep
comforting
sense
that
things
seen
are
temporal
and
things
unseen
are
eternal
i
do
not
remember
a
time
since
i
have
been
capable
of
loving
books
that
i
have
not
loved
shakespeare
i
can
not
tell
exactly
when
i
began
tales
from
shakespeare
but
i
know
that
i
read
them
at
first
with
a
child
understanding
and
a
child
wonder
macbeth
seems
to
have
impressed
me
most
one
reading
was
sufficient
to
stamp
every
detail
of
the
story
upon
my
memory
forever
for
a
long
time
the
ghosts
and
witches
pursued
me
even
into
dreamland
i
could
see
absolutely
see
the
dagger
and
lady
macbeth
little
white
hand
the
dreadful
stain
was
as
real
to
me
as
to
the
queen
i
read
king
lear
soon
after
macbeth
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
feeling
of
horror
when
i
came
to
the
scene
in
which
gloster
eyes
are
put
out
anger
seized
me
my
fingers
refused
to
move
i
sat
rigid
for
one
long
moment
the
blood
throbbing
in
my
temples
and
all
the
hatred
that
a
child
can
feel
concentrated
in
my
heart
i
must
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
shylock
and
satan
about
the
same
time
for
the
two
characters
were
long
associated
in
my
mind
i
remember
that
i
was
sorry
for
them
i
felt
vaguely
that
they
could
not
be
good
even
if
they
wished
to
because
no
one
seemed
willing
to
help
them
or
to
give
them
a
fair
chance
even
now
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
condemn
them
utterly
there
are
moments
when
i
feel
that
the
shylocks
the
judases
and
even
the
devil
are
broken
spokes
in
the
great
wheel
of
good
which
shall
in
due
time
be
made
whole
it
seems
strange
that
my
first
reading
of
shakespeare
should
have
left
me
so
many
unpleasant
memories
the
bright
gentle
fanciful
plays
the
ones
i
like
best
now
appear
not
to
have
impressed
me
at
first
perhaps
because
they
reflected
the
habitual
sunshine
and
gaiety
of
a
life
but
there
is
nothing
more
capricious
than
the
memory
of
a
child
what
it
will
hold
and
what
it
will
lose
i
have
since
read
shakespeare
plays
many
times
and
know
parts
of
them
by
heart
but
i
can
not
tell
which
of
them
i
like
best
my
delight
in
them
is
as
varied
as
my
moods
the
little
songs
and
the
sonnets
have
a
meaning
for
me
as
fresh
and
wonderful
as
the
dramas
but
with
all
my
love
for
shakespeare
it
is
often
weary
work
to
read
all
the
meanings
into
his
lines
which
critics
and
commentators
have
given
them
i
used
to
try
to
remember
their
interpretations
but
they
discouraged
and
vexed
me
so
i
made
a
secret
compact
with
myself
not
to
try
any
more
this
compact
i
have
only
just
broken
in
my
study
of
shakespeare
under
professor
kittredge
i
know
there
are
many
things
in
shakespeare
and
in
the
world
that
i
do
not
understand
and
i
am
glad
to
see
veil
after
veil
lift
gradually
revealing
new
realms
of
thought
and
beauty
next
to
poetry
i
love
history
i
have
read
every
historical
work
that
i
have
been
able
to
lay
my
hands
on
from
a
catalogue
of
dry
facts
and
dryer
dates
to
green
impartial
picturesque
history
of
the
english
people
from
freeman
history
of
europe
to
emerton
middle
ages
the
first
book
that
gave
me
any
real
sense
of
the
value
of
history
was
swinton
world
history
which
i
received
on
my
thirteenth
birthday
though
i
believe
it
is
no
longer
considered
valid
yet
i
have
kept
it
ever
since
as
one
of
my
treasures
from
it
i
learned
how
the
races
of
men
spread
from
land
to
land
and
built
great
cities
how
a
few
great
rulers
earthly
titans
put
everything
under
their
feet
and
with
a
decisive
word
opened
the
gates
of
happiness
for
millions
and
closed
them
upon
millions
more
how
different
nations
pioneered
in
art
and
knowledge
and
broke
ground
for
the
mightier
growths
of
coming
ages
how
civilization
underwent
as
it
were
the
holocaust
of
a
degenerate
age
and
rose
again
like
the
phoenix
among
the
nobler
sons
of
the
north
and
how
by
liberty
tolerance
and
education
the
great
and
the
wise
have
opened
the
way
for
the
salvation
of
the
whole
world
in
my
college
reading
i
have
become
somewhat
familiar
with
french
and
german
literature
the
german
puts
strength
before
beauty
and
truth
before
convention
both
in
life
and
in
literature
there
is
a
vehement
vigour
about
everything
that
he
does
when
he
speaks
it
is
not
to
impress
others
but
because
his
heart
would
burst
if
he
did
not
find
an
outlet
for
the
thoughts
that
burn
in
his
soul
then
too
there
is
in
german
literature
a
fine
reserve
which
i
like
but
its
chief
glory
is
the
recognition
i
find
in
it
of
the
redeeming
potency
of
woman
love
this
thought
pervades
all
german
literature
and
is
mystically
expressed
in
goethe
faust
all
things
transitory
but
as
symbols
are
sent
earth
insufficiency
here
grows
to
event
the
indescribable
here
it
is
done
the
woman
soul
leads
us
upward
and
on
of
all
the
french
writers
that
i
have
read
i
like
moliere
and
racine
best
there
are
fine
things
in
balzac
and
passages
in
merimee
which
strike
one
like
a
keen
blast
of
sea
air
alfred
de
musset
is
impossible
i
admire
victor
hugo
i
appreciate
his
genius
his
brilliancy
his
romanticism
though
he
is
not
one
of
my
literary
passions
but
hugo
and
goethe
and
schiller
and
all
great
poets
of
all
great
nations
are
interpreters
of
eternal
things
and
my
spirit
reverently
follows
them
into
the
regions
where
beauty
and
truth
and
goodness
are
one
i
am
afraid
i
have
written
too
much
about
my
and
yet
i
have
mentioned
only
the
authors
i
love
most
and
from
this
fact
one
might
easily
suppose
that
my
circle
of
friends
was
very
limited
and
undemocratic
which
would
be
a
very
wrong
impression
i
like
many
writers
for
many
reasons
carlyle
for
his
ruggedness
and
scorn
of
shams
wordsworth
who
teaches
the
oneness
of
man
and
nature
i
find
an
exquisite
pleasure
in
the
oddities
and
surprises
of
hood
in
quaintness
and
the
palpable
scent
of
lily
and
rose
in
his
verses
i
like
whittier
for
his
enthusiasms
and
moral
rectitude
i
knew
him
and
the
gentle
remembrance
of
our
friendship
doubles
the
pleasure
i
have
in
reading
his
poems
i
love
mark
twain
who
does
not
the
gods
too
loved
him
and
put
into
his
heart
all
manner
of
wisdom
then
fearing
lest
he
should
become
a
pessimist
they
spanned
his
mind
with
a
rainbow
of
love
and
faith
i
like
scott
for
his
freshness
dash
and
large
honesty
i
love
all
writers
whose
minds
like
lowell
bubble
up
in
the
sunshine
of
optimism
fountains
of
joy
and
good
will
with
occasionally
a
splash
of
anger
and
here
and
there
a
healing
spray
of
sympathy
and
pity
in
a
word
literature
is
my
utopia
here
i
am
not
disfranchised
no
barrier
of
the
senses
shuts
me
out
from
the
sweet
gracious
discourse
of
my
they
talk
to
me
without
embarrassment
or
awkwardness
the
things
i
have
learned
and
the
things
i
have
been
taught
seem
of
ridiculously
little
importance
compared
with
their
large
loves
and
heavenly
charities
chapter
xxii
i
trust
that
my
readers
have
not
concluded
from
the
preceding
chapter
on
books
that
reading
is
my
only
pleasure
my
pleasures
and
amusements
are
many
and
varied
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
my
story
i
have
referred
to
my
love
of
the
country
and
sports
when
i
was
quite
a
little
girl
i
learned
to
row
and
swim
and
during
the
summer
when
i
am
at
wrentham
massachusetts
i
almost
live
in
my
boat
nothing
gives
me
greater
pleasure
than
to
take
my
friends
out
rowing
when
they
visit
me
of
course
i
can
not
guide
the
boat
very
well
some
one
usually
sits
in
the
stern
and
manages
the
rudder
while
i
row
sometimes
however
i
go
rowing
without
the
rudder
it
is
fun
to
try
to
steer
by
the
scent
of
watergrasses
and
lilies
and
of
bushes
that
grow
on
the
shore
i
use
oars
with
leather
bands
which
keep
them
in
position
in
the
oarlocks
and
i
know
by
the
resistance
of
the
water
when
the
oars
are
evenly
poised
in
the
same
manner
i
can
also
tell
when
i
am
pulling
against
the
current
i
like
to
contend
with
wind
and
wave
what
is
more
exhilarating
than
to
make
your
staunch
little
boat
obedient
to
your
will
and
muscle
go
skimming
lightly
over
glistening
tilting
waves
and
to
feel
the
steady
imperious
surge
of
the
water
i
also
enjoy
canoeing
and
i
suppose
you
will
smile
when
i
say
that
i
especially
like
it
on
moonlight
nights
i
can
not
it
is
true
see
the
moon
climb
up
the
sky
behind
the
pines
and
steal
softly
across
the
heavens
making
a
shining
path
for
us
to
follow
but
i
know
she
is
there
and
as
i
lie
back
among
the
pillows
and
put
my
hand
in
the
water
i
fancy
that
i
feel
the
shimmer
of
her
garments
as
she
passes
sometimes
a
daring
little
fish
slips
between
my
fingers
and
often
a
presses
shyly
against
my
hand
frequently
as
we
emerge
from
the
shelter
of
a
cove
or
inlet
i
am
suddenly
conscious
of
the
spaciousness
of
the
air
about
me
a
luminous
warmth
seems
to
enfold
me
whether
it
comes
from
the
trees
which
have
been
heated
by
the
sun
or
from
the
water
i
can
never
discover
i
have
had
the
same
strange
sensation
even
in
the
heart
of
the
city
i
have
felt
it
on
cold
stormy
days
and
at
night
it
is
like
the
kiss
of
warm
lips
on
my
face
my
favourite
amusement
is
sailing
in
the
summer
of
i
visited
nova
scotia
and
had
opportunities
such
as
i
had
not
enjoyed
before
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
ocean
after
spending
a
few
days
in
country
about
which
longfellow
beautiful
poem
has
woven
a
spell
of
enchantment
miss
sullivan
and
i
went
to
halifax
where
we
remained
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
the
harbour
was
our
joy
our
paradise
what
glorious
sails
we
had
to
bedford
basin
to
mcnabb
island
to
york
redoubt
and
to
the
northwest
arm
and
at
night
what
soothing
wondrous
hours
we
spent
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
silent
oh
it
was
all
so
interesting
so
beautiful
the
memory
of
it
is
a
joy
forever
one
day
we
had
a
thrilling
experience
there
was
a
regatta
in
the
northwest
arm
in
which
the
boats
from
the
different
warships
were
engaged
we
went
in
a
along
with
many
others
to
watch
the
races
hundreds
of
little
swung
to
and
fro
close
by
and
the
sea
was
calm
when
the
races
were
over
and
we
turned
our
faces
homeward
one
of
the
party
noticed
a
black
cloud
drifting
in
from
the
sea
which
grew
and
spread
and
thickened
until
it
covered
the
whole
sky
the
wind
rose
and
the
waves
chopped
angrily
at
unseen
barriers
our
little
boat
confronted
the
gale
fearlessly
with
sails
spread
and
ropes
taut
she
seemed
to
sit
upon
the
wind
now
she
swirled
in
the
billows
now
she
spring
upward
on
a
gigantic
wave
only
to
be
driven
down
with
angry
howl
and
hiss
down
came
the
mainsail
tacking
and
jibbing
we
wrestled
with
opposing
winds
that
drove
us
from
side
to
side
with
impetuous
fury
our
hearts
beat
fast
and
our
hands
trembled
with
excitement
not
fear
for
we
had
the
hearts
of
vikings
and
we
knew
that
our
skipper
was
master
of
the
situation
he
had
steered
through
many
a
storm
with
firm
hand
and
eye
as
they
passed
us
the
large
craft
and
the
gunboats
in
the
harbour
saluted
and
the
seamen
shouted
applause
for
the
master
of
the
only
little
that
ventured
out
into
the
storm
at
last
cold
hungry
and
weary
we
reached
our
pier
last
summer
i
spent
in
one
of
the
loveliest
nooks
of
one
of
the
most
charming
villages
in
new
england
wrentham
massachusetts
is
associated
with
nearly
all
of
my
joys
and
sorrows
for
many
years
red
farm
by
king
philip
pond
the
home
of
chamberlin
and
his
family
was
my
home
i
remember
with
deepest
gratitude
the
kindness
of
these
dear
friends
and
the
happy
days
i
spent
with
them
the
sweet
companionship
of
their
children
meant
much
to
me
i
joined
in
all
their
sports
and
rambles
through
the
woods
and
frolics
in
the
water
the
prattle
of
the
little
ones
and
their
pleasure
in
the
stories
i
told
them
of
elf
and
gnome
of
hero
and
wily
bear
are
pleasant
things
to
remember
chamberlin
initiated
me
into
the
mysteries
of
tree
and
until
with
the
little
ear
of
love
i
heard
the
flow
of
sap
in
the
oak
and
saw
the
sun
glint
from
leaf
to
leaf
thus
it
is
that
even
as
the
roots
shut
in
the
darksome
earth
share
in
the
joyance
and
conceive
of
sunshine
and
wide
air
and
winged
things
by
sympathy
of
nature
so
do
i
gave
evidence
of
things
unseen
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
in
each
of
us
a
capacity
to
comprehend
the
impressions
and
emotions
which
have
been
experienced
by
mankind
from
the
beginning
each
individual
has
a
subconscious
memory
of
the
green
earth
and
murmuring
waters
and
blindness
and
deafness
can
not
rob
him
of
this
gift
from
past
generations
this
inherited
capacity
is
a
sort
of
sixth
sense
a
which
sees
hears
feels
all
in
one
i
have
many
tree
friends
in
wrentham
one
of
them
a
splendid
oak
is
the
special
pride
of
my
heart
i
take
all
my
other
friends
to
see
this
it
stands
on
a
bluff
overlooking
king
philip
pond
and
those
who
are
wise
in
tree
lore
say
it
must
have
stood
there
eight
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
there
is
a
tradition
that
under
this
tree
king
philip
the
heroic
indian
chief
gazed
his
last
on
earth
and
sky
i
had
another
tree
friend
gentle
and
more
approachable
than
the
great
oak
a
linden
that
grew
in
the
dooryard
at
red
farm
one
afternoon
during
a
terrible
thunderstorm
i
felt
a
tremendous
crash
against
the
side
of
the
house
and
knew
even
before
they
told
me
that
the
linden
had
fallen
we
went
out
to
see
the
hero
that
had
withstood
so
many
tempests
and
it
wrung
my
heart
to
see
him
prostrate
who
had
mightily
striven
and
was
now
mightily
fallen
but
i
must
not
forget
that
i
was
going
to
write
about
last
summer
in
particular
as
soon
as
my
examinations
were
over
miss
sullivan
and
i
hastened
to
this
green
nook
where
we
have
a
little
cottage
on
one
of
the
three
lakes
for
which
wrentham
is
famous
here
the
long
sunny
days
were
mine
and
all
thoughts
of
work
and
college
and
the
noisy
city
were
thrust
into
the
background
in
wrentham
we
caught
echoes
of
what
was
happening
in
the
world
war
alliance
social
conflict
we
heard
of
the
cruel
unnecessary
fighting
in
the
pacific
and
learned
of
the
struggles
going
on
between
capital
and
labour
we
knew
that
beyond
the
border
of
our
eden
men
were
making
history
by
the
sweat
of
their
brows
when
they
might
better
make
a
holiday
but
we
little
heeded
these
things
these
things
would
pass
away
here
were
lakes
and
woods
and
broad
fields
and
meadows
and
they
shall
endure
forever
people
who
think
that
all
sensations
reach
us
through
the
eye
and
the
ear
have
expressed
surprise
that
i
should
notice
any
difference
except
possibly
the
absence
of
pavements
between
walking
in
city
streets
and
in
country
roads
they
forget
that
my
whole
body
is
alive
to
the
conditions
about
me
the
rumble
and
roar
of
the
city
smite
the
nerves
of
my
face
and
i
feel
the
ceaseless
tramp
of
an
unseen
multitude
and
the
dissonant
tumult
frets
my
spirit
the
grinding
of
heavy
wagons
on
hard
pavements
and
the
monotonous
clangour
of
machinery
are
all
the
more
torturing
to
the
nerves
if
one
attention
is
not
diverted
by
the
panorama
that
is
always
present
in
the
noisy
streets
to
people
who
can
see
in
the
country
one
sees
only
nature
fair
works
and
one
soul
is
not
saddened
by
the
cruel
struggle
for
mere
existence
that
goes
on
in
the
crowded
city
several
times
i
have
visited
the
narrow
dirty
streets
where
the
poor
live
and
i
grow
hot
and
indignant
to
think
that
good
people
should
be
content
to
live
in
fine
houses
and
become
strong
and
beautiful
while
others
are
condemned
to
live
in
hideous
sunless
tenements
and
grow
ugly
withered
and
cringing
the
children
who
crowd
these
grimy
alleys
and
underfed
shrink
away
from
your
outstretched
hand
as
if
from
a
blow
dear
little
creatures
they
crouch
in
my
heart
and
haunt
me
with
a
constant
sense
of
pain
there
are
men
and
women
too
all
gnarled
and
bent
out
of
shape
i
have
felt
their
hard
rough
hands
and
realized
what
an
endless
struggle
their
existence
must
be
no
more
than
a
series
of
scrimmages
thwarted
attempts
to
do
something
their
life
seems
an
immense
disparity
between
effort
and
opportunity
the
sun
and
the
air
are
god
free
gifts
to
all
we
say
but
are
they
so
in
yonder
city
dingy
alleys
the
sun
shines
not
and
the
air
is
foul
oh
man
how
dost
thou
forget
and
obstruct
thy
brother
man
and
say
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
when
he
has
none
oh
would
that
men
would
leave
the
city
its
splendour
and
its
tumult
and
its
gold
and
return
to
wood
and
field
and
simple
honest
living
then
would
their
children
grow
stately
as
noble
trees
and
their
thoughts
sweet
and
pure
as
wayside
flowers
it
is
impossible
not
to
think
of
all
this
when
i
return
to
the
country
after
a
year
of
work
in
town
what
a
joy
it
is
to
feel
the
soft
springy
earth
under
my
feet
once
more
to
follow
grassy
roads
that
lead
to
ferny
brooks
where
i
can
bathe
my
fingers
in
a
cataract
of
rippling
notes
or
to
clamber
over
a
stone
wall
into
green
fields
that
tumble
and
roll
and
climb
in
riotous
gladness
next
to
a
leisurely
walk
i
enjoy
a
spin
on
my
tandem
bicycle
it
is
splendid
to
feel
the
wind
blowing
in
my
face
and
the
springy
motion
of
my
iron
steed
the
rapid
rush
through
the
air
gives
me
a
delicious
sense
of
strength
and
buoyancy
and
the
exercise
makes
my
pulses
dance
and
my
heart
sing
whenever
it
is
possible
my
dog
accompanies
me
on
a
walk
or
ride
or
sail
i
have
had
many
dog
friends
huge
mastiffs
spaniels
setters
and
honest
homely
bull
terriers
at
present
the
lord
of
my
affections
is
one
of
these
bull
terriers
he
has
a
long
pedigree
a
crooked
tail
and
the
drollest
phiz
in
dogdom
my
dog
friends
seem
to
understand
my
limitations
and
always
keep
close
beside
me
when
i
am
alone
i
love
their
affectionate
ways
and
the
eloquent
wag
of
their
tails
when
a
rainy
day
keeps
me
indoors
i
amuse
myself
after
the
manner
of
other
girls
i
like
to
knit
and
crochet
i
read
in
the
way
i
love
here
and
there
a
line
or
perhaps
i
play
a
game
or
two
of
checkers
or
chess
with
a
friend
i
have
a
special
board
on
which
i
play
these
games
the
squares
are
cut
out
so
that
the
men
stand
in
them
firmly
the
black
checkers
are
flat
and
the
white
ones
curved
on
top
each
checker
has
a
hole
in
the
middle
in
which
a
brass
knob
can
be
placed
to
distinguish
the
king
from
the
commons
the
chessmen
are
of
two
sizes
the
white
larger
than
the
black
so
that
i
have
no
trouble
in
following
my
opponent
maneuvers
by
moving
my
hands
lightly
over
the
board
after
a
play
the
jar
made
by
shifting
the
men
from
one
hole
to
another
tells
me
when
it
is
my
turn
if
i
happen
to
be
all
alone
and
in
an
idle
mood
i
play
a
game
of
solitaire
of
which
i
am
very
fond
i
use
playing
cards
marked
in
the
upper
corner
with
braille
symbols
which
indicate
the
value
of
the
card
if
there
are
children
around
nothing
pleases
me
so
much
as
to
frolic
with
them
i
find
even
the
smallest
child
excellent
company
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
children
usually
like
me
they
lead
me
about
and
show
me
the
things
they
are
interested
in
of
course
the
little
ones
can
not
spell
on
their
fingers
but
i
manage
to
read
their
lips
if
i
do
not
succeed
they
resort
to
dumb
show
sometimes
i
make
a
mistake
and
do
the
wrong
thing
a
burst
of
childish
laughter
greets
my
blunder
and
the
pantomime
begins
all
over
again
i
often
tell
them
stories
or
teach
them
a
game
and
the
winged
hours
depart
and
leave
us
good
and
happy
museums
and
art
stores
are
also
sources
of
pleasure
and
inspiration
doubtless
it
will
seem
strange
to
many
that
the
hand
unaided
by
sight
can
feel
action
sentiment
beauty
in
the
cold
marble
and
yet
it
is
true
that
i
derive
genuine
pleasure
from
touching
great
works
of
art
as
my
finger
tips
trace
line
and
curve
they
discover
the
thought
and
emotion
which
the
artist
has
portrayed
i
can
feel
in
the
faces
of
gods
and
heroes
hate
courage
and
love
just
as
i
can
detect
them
in
living
faces
i
am
permitted
to
touch
i
feel
in
diana
posture
the
grace
and
freedom
of
the
forest
and
the
spirit
that
tames
the
mountain
lion
and
subdues
the
fiercest
passions
my
soul
delights
in
the
repose
and
gracious
curves
of
the
venus
and
in
barre
bronzes
the
secrets
of
the
jungle
are
revealed
to
me
a
medallion
of
homer
hangs
on
the
wall
of
my
study
conveniently
low
so
that
i
can
easily
reach
it
and
touch
the
beautiful
sad
face
with
loving
reverence
how
well
i
know
each
line
in
that
majestic
brow
tracks
of
life
and
bitter
evidences
of
struggle
and
sorrow
those
sightless
eyes
seeking
even
in
the
cold
plaster
for
the
light
and
the
blue
skies
of
his
beloved
hellas
but
seeking
in
vain
that
beautiful
mouth
firm
and
true
and
tender
it
is
the
face
of
a
poet
and
of
a
man
acquainted
with
sorrow
ah
how
well
i
understand
his
deprivation
the
perpetual
night
in
which
he
dwelt
o
dark
dark
amid
the
blaze
of
noon
irrecoverably
dark
total
eclipse
without
all
hope
of
day
in
imagination
i
can
hear
homer
singing
as
with
unsteady
hesitating
steps
he
gropes
his
way
from
camp
to
camp
singing
of
life
of
love
of
war
of
the
splendid
achievements
of
a
noble
race
it
was
a
wonderful
glorious
song
and
it
won
the
blind
poet
an
immortal
crown
the
admiration
of
all
ages
i
sometimes
wonder
if
the
hand
is
not
more
sensitive
to
the
beauties
of
sculpture
than
the
eye
i
should
think
the
wonderful
rhythmical
flow
of
lines
and
curves
could
be
more
subtly
felt
than
seen
be
this
as
it
may
i
know
that
i
can
feel
the
of
the
ancient
greeks
in
their
marble
gods
and
goddesses
another
pleasure
which
comes
more
rarely
than
the
others
is
going
to
the
theatre
i
enjoy
having
a
play
described
to
me
while
it
is
being
acted
on
the
stage
far
more
than
reading
it
because
then
it
seems
as
if
i
were
living
in
the
midst
of
stirring
events
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
meet
a
few
great
actors
and
actresses
who
have
the
power
of
so
bewitching
you
that
you
forget
time
and
place
and
live
again
in
the
romantic
past
i
have
been
permitted
to
touch
the
face
and
costume
of
miss
ellen
terry
as
she
impersonated
our
ideal
of
a
queen
and
there
was
about
her
that
divinity
that
hedges
sublimest
woe
beside
her
stood
sir
henry
irving
wearing
the
symbols
of
kingship
and
there
was
majesty
of
intellect
in
his
every
gesture
and
attitude
and
the
royalty
that
subdues
and
overcomes
in
every
line
of
his
sensitive
face
in
the
king
face
which
he
wore
as
a
mask
there
was
a
remoteness
and
inaccessibility
of
grief
which
i
shall
never
forget
i
also
know
jefferson
i
am
proud
to
count
him
among
my
friends
i
go
to
see
him
whenever
i
happen
to
be
where
he
is
acting
the
first
time
i
saw
him
act
was
while
at
school
in
new
york
he
played
rip
van
winkle
i
had
often
read
the
story
but
i
had
never
felt
the
charm
of
rip
slow
quaint
kind
ways
as
i
did
in
the
play
jefferson
beautiful
pathetic
representation
quite
carried
me
away
with
delight
i
have
a
picture
of
old
rip
in
my
fingers
which
they
will
never
lose
after
the
play
miss
sullivan
took
me
to
see
him
behind
the
scenes
and
i
felt
of
his
curious
garb
and
his
flowing
hair
and
beard
jefferson
let
me
touch
his
face
so
that
i
could
imagine
how
he
looked
on
waking
from
that
strange
sleep
of
twenty
years
and
he
showed
me
how
poor
old
rip
staggered
to
his
feet
i
have
also
seen
him
in
the
rivals
once
while
i
was
calling
on
him
in
boston
he
acted
the
most
striking
parts
of
the
rivals
for
me
the
where
we
sat
served
for
a
stage
he
and
his
son
seated
themselves
at
the
big
table
and
bob
acres
wrote
his
challenge
i
followed
all
his
movements
with
my
hands
and
caught
the
drollery
of
his
blunders
and
gestures
in
a
way
that
would
have
been
impossible
had
it
all
been
spelled
to
me
then
they
rose
to
fight
the
duel
and
i
followed
the
swift
thrusts
and
parries
of
the
swords
and
the
waverings
of
poor
bob
as
his
courage
oozed
out
at
his
finger
ends
then
the
great
actor
gave
his
coat
a
hitch
and
his
mouth
a
twitch
and
in
an
instant
i
was
in
the
village
of
falling
water
and
felt
schneider
shaggy
head
against
my
knee
jefferson
recited
the
best
dialogues
of
rip
van
winkle
in
which
the
tear
came
close
upon
the
smile
he
asked
me
to
indicate
as
far
as
i
could
the
gestures
and
action
that
should
go
with
the
lines
of
course
i
have
no
sense
whatever
of
dramatic
action
and
could
make
only
random
guesses
but
with
masterful
art
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
the
sigh
of
rip
as
he
murmurs
is
a
man
so
soon
forgotten
when
he
is
gone
the
dismay
with
which
he
searches
for
dog
and
gun
after
his
long
sleep
and
his
comical
irresolution
over
signing
the
contract
with
derrick
all
these
seem
to
be
right
out
of
life
itself
that
is
the
ideal
life
where
things
happen
as
we
think
they
should
i
remember
well
the
first
time
i
went
to
the
theatre
it
was
twelve
years
ago
elsie
leslie
the
little
actress
was
in
boston
and
miss
sullivan
took
me
to
see
her
in
the
prince
and
the
pauper
i
shall
never
forget
the
ripple
of
alternating
joy
and
woe
that
ran
through
that
beautiful
little
play
or
the
wonderful
child
who
acted
it
after
the
play
i
was
permitted
to
go
behind
the
scenes
and
meet
her
in
her
royal
costume
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
a
lovelier
or
more
lovable
child
than
elsie
as
she
stood
with
a
cloud
of
golden
hair
floating
over
her
shoulders
smiling
brightly
showing
no
signs
of
shyness
or
fatigue
though
she
had
been
playing
to
an
immense
audience
i
was
only
just
learning
to
speak
and
had
previously
repeated
her
name
until
i
could
say
it
perfectly
imagine
my
delight
when
she
understood
the
few
words
i
spoke
to
her
and
without
hesitation
stretched
her
hand
to
greet
me
is
it
not
true
then
that
my
life
with
all
its
limitations
touches
at
many
points
the
life
of
the
world
beautiful
everything
has
its
wonders
even
darkness
and
silence
and
i
learn
whatever
state
i
may
be
in
therein
to
be
content
sometimes
it
is
true
a
sense
of
isolation
enfolds
me
like
a
cold
mist
as
i
sit
alone
and
wait
at
life
shut
gate
beyond
there
is
light
and
music
and
sweet
companionship
but
i
may
not
enter
fate
silent
pitiless
bars
the
way
fain
would
i
question
his
imperious
decree
for
my
heart
is
still
undisciplined
and
passionate
but
my
tongue
will
not
utter
the
bitter
futile
words
that
rise
to
my
lips
and
they
fall
back
into
my
heart
like
unshed
tears
silence
sits
immense
upon
my
soul
then
comes
hope
with
a
smile
and
whispers
there
is
joy
in
so
i
try
to
make
the
light
in
others
eyes
my
sun
the
music
in
others
ears
my
symphony
the
smile
on
others
lips
my
happiness
chapter
xxiii
would
that
i
could
enrich
this
sketch
with
the
names
of
all
those
who
have
ministered
to
my
happiness
some
of
them
would
be
found
written
in
our
literature
and
dear
to
the
hearts
of
many
while
others
would
be
wholly
unknown
to
most
of
my
readers
but
their
influence
though
it
escapes
fame
shall
live
immortal
in
the
lives
that
have
been
sweetened
and
ennobled
by
it
those
are
days
in
our
lives
when
we
meet
people
who
thrill
us
like
a
fine
poem
people
whose
handshake
is
brimful
of
unspoken
sympathy
and
whose
sweet
rich
natures
impart
to
our
eager
impatient
spirits
a
wonderful
restfulness
which
in
its
essence
is
divine
the
perplexities
irritations
and
worries
that
have
absorbed
us
pass
like
unpleasant
dreams
and
we
wake
to
see
with
new
eyes
and
hear
with
new
ears
the
beauty
and
harmony
of
god
real
world
the
solemn
nothings
that
fill
our
everyday
life
blossom
suddenly
into
bright
possibilities
in
a
word
while
such
friends
are
near
us
we
feel
that
all
is
well
perhaps
we
never
saw
them
before
and
they
may
never
cross
our
life
path
again
but
the
influence
of
their
calm
mellow
natures
is
a
libation
poured
upon
our
discontent
and
we
feel
its
healing
touch
as
the
ocean
feels
the
mountain
stream
freshening
its
brine
i
have
often
been
asked
do
not
people
bore
you
i
do
not
understand
quite
what
that
means
i
suppose
the
calls
of
the
stupid
and
curious
especially
of
newspaper
reporters
are
always
inopportune
i
also
dislike
people
who
try
to
talk
down
to
my
understanding
they
are
like
people
who
when
walking
with
you
try
to
shorten
their
steps
to
suit
yours
the
hypocrisy
in
both
cases
is
equally
exasperating
the
hands
of
those
i
meet
are
dumbly
eloquent
to
me
the
touch
of
some
hands
is
an
impertinence
i
have
met
people
so
empty
of
joy
that
when
i
clasped
their
frosty
finger
tips
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
shaking
hands
with
a
northeast
storm
others
there
are
whose
hands
have
sunbeams
in
them
so
that
their
grasp
warms
my
heart
it
may
be
only
the
clinging
touch
of
a
child
hand
but
there
is
as
much
potential
sunshine
in
it
for
me
as
there
is
in
a
loving
glance
for
others
a
hearty
handshake
or
a
friendly
letter
gives
me
genuine
pleasure
i
have
many
friends
whom
i
have
never
seen
indeed
they
are
so
many
that
i
have
often
been
unable
to
reply
to
their
letters
but
i
wish
to
say
here
that
i
am
always
grateful
for
their
kind
words
however
insufficiently
i
acknowledge
them
i
count
it
one
of
the
sweetest
privileges
of
my
life
to
have
known
and
conversed
with
many
men
of
genius
only
those
who
knew
bishop
brooks
can
appreciate
the
joy
his
friendship
was
to
those
who
possessed
it
as
a
child
i
loved
to
sit
on
his
knee
and
clasp
his
great
hand
with
one
of
mine
while
miss
sullivan
spelled
into
the
other
his
beautiful
words
about
god
and
the
spiritual
world
i
heard
him
with
a
child
wonder
and
delight
my
spirit
could
not
reach
up
to
his
but
he
gave
me
a
real
sense
of
joy
in
life
and
i
never
left
him
without
carrying
away
a
fine
thought
that
grew
in
beauty
and
depth
of
meaning
as
i
grew
once
when
i
was
puzzled
to
know
why
there
were
so
many
religions
he
said
there
is
one
universal
religion
helen
the
religion
of
love
love
your
heavenly
father
with
your
whole
heart
and
soul
love
every
child
of
god
as
much
as
ever
you
can
and
remember
that
the
possibilities
of
good
are
greater
than
the
possibilities
of
evil
and
you
have
the
key
to
heaven
and
his
life
was
a
happy
illustration
of
this
great
truth
in
his
noble
soul
love
and
widest
knowledge
were
blended
with
faith
that
had
become
insight
he
saw
god
in
all
that
liberates
and
lifts
in
all
that
humbles
sweetens
and
consoles
bishop
brooks
taught
me
no
special
creed
or
dogma
but
he
impressed
upon
my
mind
two
great
ideas
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
and
made
me
feel
that
these
truths
underlie
all
creeds
and
forms
of
worship
god
is
love
god
is
our
father
we
are
his
children
therefore
the
darkest
clouds
will
break
and
though
right
be
worsted
wrong
shall
not
triumph
i
am
too
happy
in
this
world
to
think
much
about
the
future
except
to
remember
that
i
have
cherished
friends
awaiting
me
there
in
beautiful
somewhere
in
spite
of
the
lapse
of
years
they
seem
so
close
to
me
that
i
should
not
think
it
strange
if
at
any
moment
they
should
clasp
my
hand
and
speak
words
of
endearment
as
they
used
to
before
they
went
away
since
bishop
brooks
died
i
have
read
the
bible
through
also
some
philosophical
works
on
religion
among
them
swedenborg
heaven
and
hell
and
drummond
ascent
of
man
and
i
have
found
no
creed
or
system
more
than
bishop
brooks
creed
of
love
i
knew
henry
drummond
and
the
memory
of
his
strong
warm
is
like
a
benediction
he
was
the
most
sympathetic
of
companions
he
knew
so
much
and
was
so
genial
that
it
was
impossible
to
feel
dull
in
his
presence
i
remember
well
the
first
time
i
saw
oliver
wendell
holmes
he
had
invited
miss
sullivan
and
me
to
call
on
him
one
sunday
afternoon
it
was
early
in
the
spring
just
after
i
had
learned
to
speak
we
were
shown
at
once
to
his
library
where
we
found
him
seated
in
a
big
armchair
by
an
open
fire
which
glowed
and
crackled
on
the
hearth
thinking
he
said
of
other
days
and
listening
to
the
murmur
of
the
river
charles
i
suggested
yes
he
replied
the
charles
has
many
dear
associations
for
me
there
was
an
odour
of
print
and
leather
in
the
room
which
told
me
that
it
was
full
of
books
and
i
stretched
out
my
hand
instinctively
to
find
them
my
fingers
lighted
upon
a
beautiful
volume
of
tennyson
poems
and
when
miss
sullivan
told
me
what
it
was
i
began
to
recite
break
break
break
on
thy
cold
gray
stones
o
sea
but
i
stopped
suddenly
i
felt
tears
on
my
hand
i
had
made
my
beloved
poet
weep
and
i
was
greatly
distressed
he
made
me
sit
in
his
armchair
while
he
brought
different
interesting
things
for
me
to
examine
and
at
his
request
i
recited
the
chambered
nautilus
which
was
then
my
favorite
poem
after
that
i
saw
holmes
many
times
and
learned
to
love
the
man
as
well
as
the
poet
one
beautiful
summer
day
not
long
after
my
meeting
with
holmes
miss
sullivan
and
i
visited
whittier
in
his
quiet
home
on
the
merrimac
his
gentle
courtesy
and
quaint
speech
won
my
heart
he
had
a
book
of
his
poems
in
raised
print
from
which
i
read
in
school
days
he
was
delighted
that
i
could
pronounce
the
words
so
well
and
said
that
he
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
me
then
i
asked
many
questions
about
the
poem
and
read
his
answers
by
placing
my
fingers
on
his
lips
he
said
he
was
the
little
boy
in
the
poem
and
that
the
girl
name
was
sally
and
more
which
i
have
forgotten
i
also
recited
laus
deo
and
as
i
spoke
the
concluding
verses
he
placed
in
my
hands
a
statue
of
a
slave
from
whose
crouching
figure
the
fetters
were
falling
even
as
they
fell
from
peter
limbs
when
the
angel
led
him
forth
out
of
prison
afterward
we
went
into
his
study
and
he
wrote
his
autograph
for
my
teacher
with
great
admiration
of
thy
noble
work
in
releasing
from
bondage
the
mind
of
thy
dear
pupil
i
am
truly
thy
friend
john
j
whittier
and
expressed
his
admiration
of
her
work
saying
to
me
she
is
thy
spiritual
liberator
then
he
led
me
to
the
gate
and
kissed
me
tenderly
on
my
forehead
i
promised
to
visit
him
again
the
following
summer
but
he
died
before
the
promise
was
fulfilled
edward
everett
hale
is
one
of
my
very
oldest
friends
i
have
known
him
since
i
was
eight
and
my
love
for
him
has
increased
with
my
years
his
wise
tender
sympathy
has
been
the
support
of
miss
sullivan
and
me
in
times
of
trial
and
sorrow
and
his
strong
hand
has
helped
us
over
many
rough
places
and
what
he
has
done
for
us
he
has
done
for
thousands
of
those
who
have
difficult
tasks
to
accomplish
he
has
filled
the
old
skins
of
dogma
with
the
new
wine
of
love
and
shown
men
what
it
is
to
believe
live
and
be
free
what
he
has
taught
we
have
seen
beautifully
expressed
in
his
own
life
love
of
country
kindness
to
the
least
of
his
brethren
and
a
sincere
desire
to
live
upward
and
onward
he
has
been
a
prophet
and
an
inspirer
of
men
and
a
mighty
doer
of
the
word
the
friend
of
all
his
race
god
bless
him
i
have
already
written
of
my
first
meeting
with
alexander
graham
bell
since
then
i
have
spent
many
happy
days
with
him
at
washington
and
at
his
beautiful
home
in
the
heart
of
cape
breton
island
near
baddeck
the
village
made
famous
by
charles
dudley
warner
book
here
in
bell
laboratory
or
in
the
fields
on
the
shore
of
the
great
bras
i
have
spent
many
delightful
hours
listening
to
what
he
had
to
tell
me
about
his
experiments
and
helping
him
fly
kites
by
means
of
which
he
expects
to
discover
the
laws
that
shall
govern
the
future
bell
is
proficient
in
many
fields
of
science
and
has
the
art
of
making
every
subject
he
touches
interesting
even
the
most
abstruse
theories
he
makes
you
feel
that
if
you
only
had
a
little
more
time
you
too
might
be
an
inventor
he
has
a
humorous
and
poetic
side
too
his
dominating
passion
is
his
love
for
children
he
is
never
quite
so
happy
as
when
he
has
a
little
deaf
child
in
his
arms
his
labours
in
behalf
of
the
deaf
will
live
on
and
bless
generations
of
children
yet
to
come
and
we
love
him
alike
for
what
he
himself
has
achieved
and
for
what
he
has
evoked
from
others
during
the
two
years
i
spent
in
new
york
i
had
many
opportunities
to
talk
with
distinguished
people
whose
names
i
had
often
heard
but
whom
i
had
never
expected
to
meet
most
of
them
i
met
first
in
the
house
of
my
good
friend
laurence
hutton
it
was
a
great
privilege
to
visit
him
and
dear
hutton
in
their
lovely
home
and
see
their
library
and
read
the
beautiful
sentiments
and
bright
thoughts
gifted
friends
had
written
for
them
it
has
been
truly
said
that
hutton
has
the
faculty
of
bringing
out
in
every
one
the
best
thoughts
and
kindest
sentiments
one
does
not
need
to
read
a
boy
i
knew
to
understand
him
the
most
generous
boy
i
ever
knew
a
good
friend
in
all
sorts
of
weather
who
traces
the
footprints
of
love
in
the
life
of
dogs
as
well
as
in
that
of
his
fellowmen
hutton
is
a
true
and
tried
friend
much
that
i
hold
sweetest
much
that
i
hold
most
precious
i
owe
to
her
she
has
oftenest
advised
and
helped
me
in
my
progress
through
college
when
i
find
my
work
particularly
difficult
and
discouraging
she
writes
me
letters
that
make
me
feel
glad
and
brave
for
she
is
one
of
those
from
whom
we
learn
that
one
painful
duty
fulfilled
makes
the
next
plainer
and
easier
hutton
introduced
me
to
many
of
his
literary
friends
greatest
of
whom
are
william
dean
howells
and
mark
twain
i
also
met
richard
watson
gilder
and
edmund
clarence
stedman
i
also
knew
charles
dudley
warner
the
most
delightful
of
and
the
most
beloved
friend
whose
sympathy
was
so
broad
that
it
may
be
truly
said
of
him
he
loved
all
living
things
and
his
neighbour
as
himself
once
warner
brought
to
see
me
the
dear
poet
of
the
woodlands
john
burroughs
they
were
all
gentle
and
sympathetic
and
i
felt
the
charm
of
their
manner
as
much
as
i
had
felt
the
brilliancy
of
their
essays
and
poems
i
could
not
keep
pace
with
all
these
literary
folk
as
they
glanced
from
subject
to
subject
and
entered
into
deep
dispute
or
made
conversation
sparkle
with
epigrams
and
happy
witticisms
i
was
like
little
ascanius
who
followed
with
unequal
steps
the
heroic
strides
of
aeneas
on
his
march
toward
mighty
destinies
but
they
spoke
many
gracious
words
to
me
gilder
told
me
about
his
moonlight
journeys
across
the
vast
desert
to
the
pyramids
and
in
a
letter
he
wrote
me
he
made
his
mark
under
his
signature
deep
in
the
paper
so
that
i
could
feel
it
this
reminds
me
that
hale
used
to
give
a
personal
touch
to
his
letters
to
me
by
pricking
his
signature
in
braille
i
read
from
mark
twain
lips
one
or
two
of
his
good
stories
he
has
his
own
way
of
thinking
saying
and
doing
everything
i
feel
the
twinkle
of
his
eye
in
his
handshake
even
while
he
utters
his
cynical
wisdom
in
an
indescribably
droll
voice
he
makes
you
feel
that
his
heart
is
a
tender
iliad
of
human
sympathy
there
are
a
host
of
other
interesting
people
i
met
in
new
york
mary
mapes
dodge
the
beloved
editor
of
nicholas
and
riggs
kate
douglas
wiggin
the
sweet
author
of
patsy
i
received
from
them
gifts
that
have
the
gentle
concurrence
of
the
heart
books
containing
their
own
thoughts
letters
and
photographs
that
i
love
to
have
described
again
and
again
but
there
is
not
space
to
mention
all
my
friends
and
indeed
there
are
things
about
them
hidden
behind
the
wings
of
cherubim
things
too
sacred
to
set
forth
in
cold
print
it
is
with
hesitancy
that
i
have
spoken
even
of
laurence
hutton
i
shall
mention
only
two
other
friends
one
is
william
thaw
of
pittsburgh
whom
i
have
often
visited
in
her
home
lyndhurst
she
is
always
doing
something
to
make
some
one
happy
and
her
generosity
and
wise
counsel
have
never
failed
my
teacher
and
me
in
all
the
years
we
have
known
her
to
the
other
friend
i
am
also
deeply
indebted
he
is
well
known
for
the
powerful
hand
with
which
he
guides
vast
enterprises
and
his
wonderful
abilities
have
gained
for
him
the
respect
of
all
kind
to
every
one
he
goes
about
doing
good
silent
and
unseen
again
i
touch
upon
the
circle
of
honoured
names
i
must
not
mention
but
i
would
fain
acknowledge
his
generosity
and
affectionate
interest
which
make
it
possible
for
me
to
go
to
college
thus
it
is
that
my
friends
have
made
the
story
of
my
life
in
a
thousand
ways
they
have
turned
my
limitations
into
beautiful
privileges
and
enabled
me
to
walk
serene
and
happy
in
the
shadow
cast
by
my
deprivation
ii
letters
ii
letters
introduction
helen
keller
letters
are
important
not
only
as
a
supplementary
story
of
her
life
but
as
a
demonstration
of
her
growth
in
thought
and
expression
the
growth
which
in
itself
has
made
her
distinguished
these
letters
are
however
not
merely
remarkable
as
the
productions
of
a
deaf
and
blind
girl
to
be
read
with
wonder
and
curiosity
they
are
good
letters
almost
from
the
first
the
best
passages
are
those
in
which
she
talks
about
herself
and
gives
her
world
in
terms
of
her
experience
of
it
her
views
on
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
are
not
important
but
most
important
are
her
accounts
of
what
speech
meant
to
her
of
how
she
felt
the
statues
the
dogs
the
chickens
at
the
poultry
show
and
how
she
stood
in
the
aisle
of
bartholomew
and
felt
the
organ
rumble
those
are
passages
of
which
one
would
ask
for
more
the
reason
they
are
comparatively
few
is
that
all
her
life
she
has
been
trying
to
be
like
other
people
and
so
she
too
often
describes
things
not
as
they
appear
to
her
but
as
they
appear
to
one
with
eyes
and
ears
one
cause
for
the
excellence
of
her
letters
is
the
great
number
of
them
they
are
the
exercises
which
have
trained
her
to
write
she
has
lived
at
different
times
in
different
parts
of
the
country
and
so
has
been
separated
from
most
of
her
friends
and
relatives
of
her
friends
many
have
been
distinguished
people
to
whom
not
often
i
think
at
the
sacrifice
of
spontaneity
she
has
felt
it
necessary
to
write
well
to
them
and
to
a
few
friends
with
whom
she
is
in
closest
sympathy
she
writes
with
intimate
frankness
whatever
she
is
thinking
about
her
naive
retelling
of
a
child
tale
she
has
heard
like
the
story
of
little
jakey
which
she
rehearses
for
holmes
and
bishop
brooks
is
charming
and
her
grave
paraphrase
of
the
day
lesson
in
geography
or
botany
her
repetition
of
what
she
has
heard
and
her
conscious
display
of
new
words
are
delightful
and
instructive
for
they
show
not
only
what
she
was
learning
but
how
by
putting
it
all
into
letters
she
made
the
new
knowledge
and
the
new
words
her
own
so
these
selections
from
miss
keller
correspondence
are
made
with
two
purposes
to
show
her
development
and
to
preserve
the
most
entertaining
and
significant
passages
from
several
hundred
letters
many
of
those
written
before
were
published
in
the
reports
of
the
perkins
institution
for
the
blind
all
letters
up
to
that
year
are
printed
intact
for
it
is
legitimate
to
be
interested
in
the
degree
of
skill
the
child
showed
in
writing
even
to
details
of
punctuation
so
it
is
well
to
preserve
a
literal
integrity
of
reproduction
from
the
letters
after
the
year
i
have
culled
in
the
spirit
of
one
making
an
anthology
choosing
the
passages
best
in
style
and
most
important
from
the
point
of
view
of
biography
where
i
have
been
able
to
collate
the
original
letters
i
have
preserved
everything
as
miss
keller
wrote
it
punctuation
spelling
and
all
i
have
done
nothing
but
select
and
cut
the
letters
are
arranged
in
chronological
order
one
or
two
letters
from
bishop
brooks
holmes
and
whittier
are
put
immediately
after
the
letters
to
which
they
are
replies
except
for
two
or
three
important
letters
of
these
selections
cease
with
the
year
in
that
year
miss
keller
entered
college
now
that
she
is
a
grown
woman
her
mature
letters
should
be
judged
like
those
of
any
other
person
and
it
seems
best
that
no
more
of
her
correspondence
be
published
unless
she
should
become
distinguished
beyond
the
fact
that
she
is
the
only
deaf
and
blind
person
in
the
world

much
what
one
would
expect
from
an
ordinary
child
of
eight
except
perhaps
her
naive
satisfaction
in
the
boldness
of
the
young
gentlemen
to
kate
adams

well
she

her
first
lesson
in
history
to
morrison
heady
south
boston
mass
october
my
dear
uncle
morrie
i
think
you
will
be
very
glad
to
receive
a
letter
from
your
dear
little
friend
helen
i
am
very
happy
to
write
to
you
because
i
think
of
you
and
love
you
i
read
pretty
stories
in
the
book
you
sent
me
about
charles
and
his
boat
and
arthur
and
his
dream
and
rosa
and
the
sheep
i
have
been
in
a
large
boat
it
was
like
a
ship
mother
and
teacher
and
hopkins
and
anagnos
and
rodocanachi
and
many
other
friends
went
to
plymouth
to
see
many
old
things
i
will
tell
you
a
little
story
about
plymouth
many
years
ago
there
lived
in
england
many
good
people
but
the
king
and
his
friends
were
not
kind
and
gentle
and
patient
with
good
people
because
the
king
did
not
like
to
have
the
people
disobey
him
people
did
not
like
to
go
to
church
with
the
king
but
they
did
like
to
build
very
nice
little
churches
for
themselves
the
king
was
very
angry
with
the
people
and
they
were
sorry
and
they
said
we
will
go
away
to
a
strange
country
to
live
and
leave
very
dear
home
and
friends
and
naughty
king
so
they
put
all
their
things
into
big
boxes
and
said
i
am
sorry
for
them
because
they
cried
much
when
they
went
to
holland
they
did
not
know
anyone
and
they
could
not
know
what
the
people
were
talking
about
because
they
did
not
know
dutch
but
soon
they
learned
some
dutch
words
but
they
loved
their
own
language
and
they
did
not
want
little
boys
and
girls
to
forget
it
and
learn
to
talk
funny
dutch
so
they
said
we
must
go
to
a
new
country
far
away
and
build
schools
and
houses
and
churches
and
make
new
cities
so
they
put
all
their
things
in
boxes
and
said
to
their
new
friends
and
sailed
away
in
a
large
boat
to
find
a
new
country
poor
people
were
not
happy
for
their
hearts
were
full
of
sad
thoughts
because
they
did
not
know
much
about
america
i
think
little
children
must
have
been
afraid
of
a
great
ocean
for
it
is
very
strong
and
it
makes
a
large
boat
rock
and
then
the
little
children
would
fall
down
and
hurt
their
heads
after
they
had
been
many
weeks
on
the
deep
ocean
where
they
could
not
see
trees
or
flowers
or
grass
but
just
water
and
the
beautiful
sky
for
ships
could
not
sail
quickly
then
because
men
did
not
know
about
engines
and
steam
one
day
a
dear
little
was
born
his
name
was
peregrine
white
i
am
very
sorry
that
poor
little
peregrine
is
dead
now
every
day
the
people
went
upon
deck
to
look
out
for
land
one
day
there
was
a
great
shout
on
the
ship
for
the
people
saw
the
land
and
they
were
full
of
joy
because
they
had
reached
a
new
country
safely
little
girls
and
boys
jumped
and
clapped
their
hands
they
were
all
glad
when
they
stepped
upon
a
huge
rock
i
did
see
the
rock
in
plymouth
and
a
little
ship
like
the
mayflower
and
the
cradle
that
dear
little
peregrine
slept
in
and
many
old
things
that
came
in
the
mayflower
would
you
like
to
visit
plymouth
some
time
and
see
many
old
things
now
i
am
very
tired
and
i
will
rest
with
much
love
and
many
kisses
from
your
little
friend
helen
keller
the
foreign
words
in
these
two
letters
the
first
of
which
was
written
during
a
visit
to
the
kindergarten
for
the
blind
she
had
been
told
months
before
and
had
stowed
them
away
in
her
memory
she
assimilated
words
and
practised
with
them
sometimes
using
them
intelligently
sometimes
repeating
them
in
a
fashion
even
when
she
did
not
fully
understand
words
or
ideas
she
liked
to
set
them
down
as
though
she
did
it
was
in
this
way
that
she
learned
to
use
correctly
words
of
sound
and
vision
which
express
ideas
outside
of
her
experience

and
their
friends
have
gone
to
see
a
huge
furnace
the
furnace
is
to
make
iron
the
iron
ore
is
found
in
the
ground
but
it
can
not
be
used
until
it
has
been
brought
to
the
furnace
and
melted
and
all
the
dirt
taken
out
and
just
the
pure
iron
left
then
it
is
all
ready
to
be
manufactured
into
engines
stoves
kettles
and
many
other
things
coal
is
found
in
the
ground
too
many
years
ago
before
people
came
to
live
on
the
earth
great
trees
and
tall
grasses
and
huge
ferns
and
all
the
beautiful
flowers
cover
the
earth
when
the
leaves
and
the
trees
fell
the
water
and
the
soil
covered
them
and
then
more
trees
grew
and
fell
also
and
were
buried
under
water
and
soil
after
they
had
all
been
pressed
together
for
many
thousands
of
years
the
wood
grew
very
hard
like
rock
and
then
it
was
all
ready
for
people
to
burn
can
you
see
leaves
and
ferns
and
bark
on
the
coal
men
go
down
into
the
ground
and
dig
out
the
coal
and
take
it
to
the
large
cities
and
sell
it
to
people
to
burn
to
make
them
warm
and
happy
when
it
is
cold
out
of
doors
are
you
very
lonely
and
sad
now
i
hope
you
will
come
to
see
me
soon
and
stay
a
long
time
with
much
love
from
your
little
friend
helen
keller
to
miss
della
bennett
tuscumbia
my
dear
miss
bennett
i
am
delighted
to
write
to
you
this
morning
we
have
just
eaten
our
breakfast
mildred
is
running
about
downstairs
i
have
been
reading
in
my
book
about
astronomers
astronomer
comes
from
the
latin
word
astra
which
means
stars
and
astronomers
are
men
who
study
the
stars
and
tell
us
about
them
when
we
are
sleeping
quietly
in
our
beds
they
are
watching
the
beautiful
sky
through
the
telescope
a
telescope
is
like
a
very
strong
eye
the
stars
are
so
far
away
that
people
can
not
tell
much
about
them
without
very
excellent
instruments
do
you
like
to
look
out
of
your
window
and
see
little
stars
teacher
says
she
can
see
venus
from
our
window
and
it
is
a
large
and
beautiful
star
the
stars
are
called
the
earth
brothers
and
sisters
there
are
a
great
many
instruments
besides
those
which
the
astronomers
use
a
knife
is
an
instrument
to
cut
with
i
think
the
bell
is
an
instrument
too
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
about
bells
some
bells
are
musical
and
others
are
unmusical
some
are
very
tiny
and
some
are
very
large
i
saw
a
very
large
bell
at
wellesley
it
came
from
japan
bells
are
used
for
many
purposes
they
tell
us
when
breakfast
is
ready
when
to
go
to
school
when
it
is
time
for
church
and
when
there
is
a
fire
they
tell
people
when
to
go
to
work
and
when
to
go
home
and
rest
the
tells
the
passengers
that
they
are
coming
to
a
station
and
it
tells
the
people
to
keep
out
of
the
way
sometimes
very
terrible
accidents
happen
and
many
people
are
burned
and
drowned
and
injured
the
other
day
i
broke
my
doll
head
off
but
that
was
not
a
dreadful
accident
because
dolls
do
not
live
and
feel
like
people
my
little
pigeons
are
well
and
so
is
my
little
bird
i
would
like
to
have
some
clay
teacher
says
it
is
time
for
me
to
study
now
with
much
love
and
many
kisses
helen
keller
to
edward
everett
hale
tuscumbia
alabama
february
my
dear
hale
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
you
are
thinking
in
your
mind
that
little
helen
has
forgotten
all
about
you
and
her
dear
cousins
but
i
think
you
will
be
delighted
to
receive
this
letter
because
then
you
will
know
that
i
of
ten
think
about
you
and
i
love
you
dearly
for
you
are
my
dear
cousin
i
have
been
at
home
a
great
many
weeks
now
it
made
me
feel
very
sad
to
leave
boston
and
i
missed
all
of
my
friends
greatly
but
of
course
i
was
glad
to
get
back
to
my
lovely
home
once
more
my
darling
little
sister
is
growing
very
fast
sometimes
she
tries
to
spell
very
short
words
on
her
small
fingers
but
she
is
too
young
to
remember
hard
words
when
she
is
older
i
will
teach
her
many
things
if
she
is
patient
and
obedient
my
teacher
says
if
children
learn
to
be
patient
and
gentle
while
they
are
little
that
when
they
grow
to
be
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
they
will
not
forget
to
be
kind
and
loving
and
brave
i
hope
i
shall
be
courageous
always
a
little
girl
in
a
story
was
not

of

keller
early
letters
this
to
her
french
teacher
is
her
of
a
story
it
shows
how
much
the
gift
of
writing
is
in
the
early
stages
of
its
development
the
gift
of
mimicry
to
miss
fannie
marrett
tuscumbia
may
my
dear
miss
marrett
i
am
thinking
about
a
dear
little
girl
who
wept
very
hard
she
wept
because
her
brother
teased
her
very
much
i
will
tell
you
what
he
did
and
i
think
you
will
feel
very
sorry
for
the
little
child
she
had
a
most
beautiful
doll
given
her
oh
it
was
a
lovely
and
delicate
doll
but
the
little
brother
a
tall
lad
had
taken
the
doll
and
set
it
up
in
a
high
tree
in
the
garden
and
had
run
away
the
little
girl
could
not
reach
the
doll
and
could
not
help
it
down
and
therefore
she
cried
the
doll
cried
too
and
stretched
out
its
arms
from
among
the
green
branches
and
looked
distressed
soon
the
dismal
night
would
come
and
was
the
doll
to
sit
up
in
the
tree
all
night
and
by
herself
the
little
girl
could
not
endure
that
thought
i
will
stay
with
you
said
she
to
the
doll
although
she
was
not
at
all
courageous
already
she
began
to
see
quite
plainly
the
little
elves
in
their
tall
pointed
hats
dancing
down
the
dusky
alleys
and
peeping
from
between
the
bushes
and
they
seemed
to
come
nearer
and
nearer
and
she
stretched
her
hands
up
towards
the
tree
in
which
the
doll
sat
and
they
laughed
and
pointed
their
fingers
at
her
how
terrified
was
the
little
girl
but
if
one
has
not
done
anything
wrong
these
strange
little
elves
can
not
harm
one
have
i
done
anything
wrong
ah
yes
said
the
little
girl
i
have
laughed
at
the
poor
duck
with
the
red
rag
tied
round
its
leg
it
hobbled
and
that
made
me
laugh
but
it
is
wrong
to
laugh
at
the
poor
animals
is
it
not
a
pitiful
story
i
hope
the
father
punished
the
naughty
little
boy
shall
you
be
very
glad
to
see
my
teacher
next
thursday
she
is
going
home
to
rest
but
she
will
come
back
to
me
next
autumn
lovingly
your
little
friend
helen
adams
keller
to
miss
mary
riley
tuscumbia
may
my
dear
miss
riley
i
wish
you
were
here
in
the
warm
sunny
south
today

sister
and
i
would
take
you
out
into
the
garden
and
pick
the
delicious
raspberries
and
a
few
strawberries
for
you
how
would
you
like
that
the
strawberries
are
nearly
all
gone
in
the
evening
when
it
is
cool
and
pleasant
we
would
walk
in
the
yard
and
catch
the
grasshoppers
and
butterflies
we
would
talk
about
the
birds
and
flowers
and
grass
and
jumbo
and
pearl
if
you
liked
we
would
run
and
jump
and
hop
and
dance
and
be
very
happy
i
think
you
would
enjoy
hearing
the
sing
one
sits
on
the
twig
of
a
tree
just
beneath
our
window
and
he
fills
the
air
with
his
glad
songs

not
come

will
write
to
you
and
send
you
a
sweet
kiss

love

columbus

our
dear
country
when

few
days

i
received
a
little
box
of
english
violets
from
lady
meath
the
flowers
were
wilted
but
the
kind
thought
which
came
with
them
was
as
sweet
and
as
fresh
as
newly
pulled
violets
with
loving
greeting
to
the
little
cousins
and
hale
and
a
sweet
kiss
for

to

soon
after
a
visit
to
him
he
published
in
over
the
teacups
atlantic
monthly
may
to
oliver
wendell
holmes
south
boston
march
dear
kind
poet
i
have
thought
of
you
many
times
since
that
bright
sunday
when
i
bade
you
and
i
am
going
to
write
you
a
letter
because
i
love
you
i
am
sorry
that
you
have
no
little
children
to
play
with
you
sometimes
but
i
think
you
are
very
happy
with
your
books
and
your
many
many
friends
on
washington
birthday
a
great
many
people
came
here
to
see
the
blind
children
and
i
read
for
them
from
your
poems
and
showed
them
some
beautiful
shells
which
came
from
a
little
island
near
palos
i
am
reading
a
very
sad
story
called
little
jakey
jakey
was
the
sweetest
little
fellow
you
can
imagine
but
he
was
poor
and
blind
i
used
to
think
when
i
was
small
and
before
i
could
read
that
everybody
was
always
happy
and
at
first
it
made
me
very
sad
to
know
about
pain
and
great
sorrow
but
now
i
know
that
we
could
never
learn
to
be
brave
and
patient
if
there
were
only
joy
in
the
world
i
am
studying
about
insects
in
zoology
and
i
have
learned
many
things
about
butterflies
they
do
not
make
honey
for
us
like
the
bees
but
many
of
them
are
as
beautiful
as
the
flowers
they
light
upon
and
they
always
delight
the
hearts
of
little
children
they
live
a
gay
life
flitting
from
flower
to
flower
sipping
the
drops
of
honeydew
without
a
thought
for
the
morrow
they
are
just
like
little
boys
and
girls
when
they
forget
books
and
studies
and
run
away
to
the
woods
and
the
fields
to
gather
wild
flowers
or
wade
in
the
ponds
for
fragrant
lilies
happy
in
the
bright
sunshine
if
my
little
sister
comes
to
boston
next
june
will
you
let
me
bring
her
to
see
you
she
is
a
lovely
baby
and
i
am
sure
you
will
love
her
now
i
must
tell
my
gentle
poet
for
i
have
a
letter
to
write
home
before
i
go
to
bed
from
your
loving
little
friend
helen
keller
to
miss
sarah
fuller
miss
fuller
gave
helen
keller
her
first
lesson
in
articulation
see
chapter
iv
speech
south
boston
april
my
dear
miss
fuller
my
heart
is
full
of
joy
this
beautiful
morning
because
i
have
learned
to
speak
many
new
words
and
i
can
make
a
few
sentences
last
evening
i
went
out
in
the
yard
and
spoke
to
the
moon
i
said
o
moon
come
to
me
do
you
think
the
lovely
moon
was
glad
that
i
could
speak
to
her
how
glad
my
mother
will
be
i
can
hardly
wait
for
june
to
come
i
am
so
eager
to
speak
to
her
and
to
my
precious
little
sister
mildred
could
not
understand
me
when
i
spelled
with
my
fingers
but
now
she
will
sit
in
my
lap
and
i
will
tell
her
many
things
to
please
her
and
we
shall
be
so
happy
together
are
you
very
very
happy
because
you
can
make
so
many
people
happy
i
think
you
are
very
kind
and
patient
and
i
love
you
very
dearly
my
teacher
told
me
tuesday
that
you
wanted
to
know
how
i
came
to
wish
to
talk
with
my
mouth
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
for
i
remember
my
thoughts
perfectly
when
i
was
a
very
little
child
i
used
to
sit
in
my
mother
lap
all
the
time
because
i
was
very
timid
and
did
not
like
to
be
left
by
myself
and
i
would
keep
my
little
hand
on
her
face
all
the
while
because
it
amused
me
to
feel
her
face
and
lips
move
when
she
talked
with
people
i
did
not
know
then
what
she
was
doing
for
i
was
quite
ignorant
of
all
things
then
when
i
was
older
i
learned
to
play
with
my
nurse
and
the
little
negro
children
and
i
noticed
that
they
kept
moving
their
lips
just
like
my
mother
so
i
moved
mine
too
but
sometimes
it
made
me
angry
and
i
would
hold
my
playmates
mouths
very
hard
i
did
not
know
then
that
it
was
very
naughty
to
do
so
after
a
long
time
my
dear
teacher
came
to
me
and
taught
me
to
communicate
with
my
fingers
and
i
was
satisfied
and
happy
but
when
i
came
to
school
in
boston
i
met
some
deaf
people
who
talked
with
their
mouths
like
all
other
people
and
one
day
a
lady
who
had
been
to
norway
came
to
see
me
and
told
me
of
a
blind
and
deaf
girl
ragnhild
kaata
she
had
seen
in
that
far
away
land
who
had
been
taught
to
speak
and
understand
others
when
they
spoke
to
her
this
good
and
happy
news
delighted
me
exceedingly
for
then
i
was
sure
that
i
should
learn
also
i
tried
to
make
sounds
like
my
little
playmates
but
teacher
told
me
that
the
voice
was
very
delicate
and
sensitive
and
that
it
would
injure
it
to
make
incorrect
sounds
and
promised
to
take
me
to
see
a
kind
and
wise
lady
who
would
teach
me
rightly
that
lady
was
yourself
now
i
am
as
happy
as
the
little
birds
because
i
can
speak
and
perhaps
i
shall
sing
too
all
of
my
friends
will
be
so
surprised
and
glad
your
loving
little
pupil
helen
keller
when
the
perkins
institution
closed
for
the
summer
helen
and
miss
sullivan
went
to
tuscumbia
this
was
the
first
after
she
had
learned
to
talk
with
her
mouth
to
rev
phillips
brooks
tuscumbia
alabama
july
my
dear
brooks
i
am
very
glad
to
write
to
you
this
beautiful
day
because
you
are
my
kind
friend
and
i
love
you
and
because
i
wish
to
know
many
things
i
have
been
at
home
three
weeks
and
oh
how
happy
i
have
been
with
dear
mother
and
father
and
precious
little
sister
i
was
very
very
sad
to
part
with
all
of
my
friends
in
boston
but
i
was
so
eager
to
see
my
baby
sister
i
could
hardly
wait
for
the
train
to
take
me
home
but
i
tried
very
hard
to
be
patient
for
teacher
sake
mildred
has
grown
much
taller
and
stronger
than
she
was
when
i
went
to
boston
and
she
is
the
sweetest
and
dearest
little
child
in
the
world
my
parents
were
delighted
to
hear
me
speak
and
i
was
overjoyed
to
give
them
such
a
happy
surprise
i
think
it
is
so
pleasant
to
make
everybody
happy
why
does
the
dear
father
in
heaven
think
it
best
for
us
to
have
very
great
sorrow
sometimes
i
am
always
happy
and
so
was
little
lord
fauntleroy
but
dear
little
jakey
life
was
full
of
sadness
god
did
not
put
the
light
in
jakey
eyes
and
he
was
blind
and
his
father
was
not
gentle
and
loving
do
you
think
poor
jakey
loved
his
father
in
heaven
more
because
his
other
father
was
unkind
to
him
how
did
god
tell
people
that
his
home
was
in
heaven
when
people
do
very
wrong
and
hurt
animals
and
treat
children
unkindly
god
is
grieved
but
what
will
he
do
to
them
to
teach
them
to
be
pitiful
and
loving
i
think
he
will
tell
them
how
dearly
he
loves
them
and
that
he
wants
them
to
be
good
and
happy
and
they
will
not
wish
to
grieve
their
father
who
loves
them
so
much
and
they
will
want
to
please
him
in
everything
they
do
so
they
will
love
each
other
and
do
good
to
everyone
and
be
kind
to
animals
please
tell
me
something
that
you
know
about
god
it
makes
me
happy
to
know
much
about
my
loving
father
who
is
good
and
wise
i
hope
you
will
write
to
your
little
friend
when
you
have
time
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
you
is
the
sun
very
hot
in
boston
now
this
afternoon
if
it
is
cool
enough
i
shall
take
mildred
for
a
ride
on
my
donkey

neddy

me
and
he
is
the
prettiest
donkey

great
dog
lioness

about
god

good
to
us
all
the
time
let
me
tell
you
how
it
seems
to
me
that
we
come
to
know
about
our
heavenly
father
it
is
from
the
power
of
love
which
is
in
our
own
hearts
love
is
at
the
soul
of
everything
whatever
has
not
the
power
of
loving
must
have
a
very
dreary
life
indeed
we
like
to
think
that
the
sunshine
and
the
winds
and
the
trees
are
able
to
love
in
some
way
of
their
own
for
it
would
make
us
know
that
they
were
happy
if
we
knew
that
they
could
love
and
so
god
who
is
the
greatest
and
happiest
of
all
beings
is
the
most
loving
too
all
the
love
that
is
in
our
hearts
comes
from
him
as
all
the
light
which
is
in
the
flowers
comes
from
the
sun
and
the
more
we
love
the
more
near
we
are
to
god
and
his
love
i
told
you
that
i
was
very
happy
because
of
your
happiness
indeed
i
am
so
are
your
father
and
your
mother
and
your
teacher
and
all
your
friends
but
do
you
not
think
that
god
is
happy
too
because
you
are
happy
i
am
sure
he
is
and
he
is
happier
than
any
of
us
because
he
is
greater
than
any
of
us
and
also
because
he
not
merely
sees
your
happiness
as
we
do
but
he
also
made
it
he
gives
it
to
you
as
the
sun
gives
light
and
color
to
the
rose
and
we
are
always
most
glad
of
what
we
not
merely
see
our
friends
enjoy
but
of
what
we
give
them
to
enjoy
are
we
not
but
god
does
not
only
want
us
to
be
happy
he
wants
us
to
be
good
he
wants
that
most
of
all
he
knows
that
we
can
be
really
happy
only
when
we
are
good
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
that
is
in
the
world
is
medicine
which
is
very
bad
to
take
but
which
it
is
good
to
take
because
it
makes
us
better
we
see
how
good
people
may
be
in
great
trouble
when
we
think
of
jesus
who
was
the
greatest
sufferer
that
ever
lived
and
yet
was
the
best
being
and
so
i
am
sure
the
happiest
being
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
i
love
to
tell
you
about
god
but
he
will
tell
you
himself
by
the
love
which
he
will
put
into
your
heart
if
you
ask
him
and
jesus
who
is
his
son
but
is
nearer
to
him
than
all
of
us
his
other
children
came
into
the
world
on
purpose
to
tell
us
all
about
our
father
love
if
you
read
his
words
you
will
see
how
full
his
heart
is
of
the
love
of
god
we
know
that
he
loves
us
he
says
and
so
he
loved
men
himself
and
though
they
were
very
cruel
to
him
and
at
last
killed
him
he
was
willing
to
die
for
them
because
he
loved
them
so
and
helen
he
loves
men
still
and
he
loves
us
and
he
tells
us
that
we
may
love
him
and
so
love
is
everything
and
if
anybody
asks
you
or
if
you
ask
yourself
what
god
is
answer
god
is
love
that
is
the
beautiful
answer
which
the
bible
gives
all
this
is
what
you
are
to
think
of
and
to
understand
more
and
more
as
you
grow
older
think
of
it
now
and
let
it
make
every
blessing
brighter
because
your
dear
father
sends
it
to
you
you
will
come
back
to
boston
i
hope
soon
after
i
do
i
shall
be
there
by
the
middle
of
september
i
shall
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
everything
and
not
forget
the
donkey
i
send
my
kind
remembrance
to
your
father
and
mother
and
to
your
teacher
i
wish
i
could
see
your
little
sister
good
bye
dear
helen
do
write
to
me
soon
again
directing
your
letter
to
boston
your
affectionate
friend
phillips
brooks
holmes
reply
to
a
letter
which
has
been
lost
beverly
farms
august
my
dear
little
friend
helen
i
received
your
welcome
letter
several
days
ago
but
i
have
so
much
writing
to
do
that
i
am
apt
to
make
my
letters
wait
a
good
while
before
they
get
answered
it
gratifies
me
very
much
to
find
that
you
remember
me
so
kindly
your
letter
is
charming
and
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
it
i
rejoice
to
know
that
you
are
well
and
happy
i
am
very
much
delighted
to
hear
of
your
new
acquisition
that
you
talk
with
your
mouth
as
well
as
with
your
fingers
what
a
curious
thing
speech
is
the
tongue
is
so
serviceable
a
member
taking
all
sorts
of
shapes
just
as
is
wanted
the
teeth
the
lips
the
roof
of
the
mouth
all
ready
to
help
and
so
heap
up
the
sound
of
the
voice
into
the
solid
bits
which
we
call
consonants
and
make
room
for
the
curiously
shaped
breathings
which
we
call
vowels
you
have
studied
all
this
i
do
doubt
since
you
have
practised
vocal
speaking
i
am
surprised
at
the
mastery
of
language
which
your
letter
shows
it
almost
makes
me
think
the
world
would
get
along
as
well
without
seeing
and
hearing
as
with
them
perhaps
people
would
be
better
in
a
great
many
ways
for
they
could
not
fight
as
they
do
now
just
think
of
an
army
of
blind
people
with
guns
and
cannon
think
of
the
poor
drummers
of
what
use
would
they
and
their
drumsticks
be
you
are
spared
the
pain
of
many
sights
and
sounds
which
you
are
only
too
happy
in
escaping
then
think
how
much
kindness
you
are
sure
of
as
long
as
you
live
everybody
will
feel
an
interest
in
dear
little
helen
everybody
will
want
to
do
something
for
her
and
if
she
becomes
an
ancient
woman
she
is
still
sure
of
being
thoughtfully
cared
for
your
parents
and
friends
must
take
great
satisfaction
in
your
progress
it
does
great
credit
not
only
to
you
but
to
your
instructors
who
have
so
broken
down
the
walls
that
seemed
to
shut
you
in
that
now
your
outlook
seems
more
bright
and
cheerful
than
that
of
many
seeing
and
hearing
children
dear
little
helen
with
every
kind
wish
from
your
friend
oliver
wendell
holmes
this
letter
was
written
to
some
gentlemen
in
gardiner
maine
who
named
a
lumber
vessel
after
her
to
bradstreet
tuscumbia
july
my
dear
kind
friends
i
thank
you
very
very
much
for
naming
your
beautiful
new
ship
for
me
it
makes
me
very
happy
to
know
that
i
have
kind
and
loving
friends
in
the
state
of
maine
i
did
not
imagine
when
i
studied
about
the
forests
of
maine
that
a
strong
and
beautiful
ship
would
go
sailing
all
over
the
world
carrying
wood
from
those
rich
forests
to
build
pleasant
homes
and
schools
and
churches
in
distant
countries
i
hope
the
great
ocean
will
love
the
new
helen
and
let
her
sail
over
its
blue
waves
peacefully
please
tell
the
brave
sailors
who
have
charge
of
the
helen
keller
that
little
helen
who
stays
at
home
will
often
think
of
them
with
loving
thoughts
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
and
my
beautiful
namesake
some
time
with
much
love
from
your
little
friend
helen
keller
to
the

early
in
november
to
kate
adams
keller
south
boston
my
dearest
mother
my
heart
has
been
full
of
thoughts
of
you
and
my
beautiful
home
ever
since
we
parted
so
sadly
on
wednesday
night
how
i
wish
i
could
see
you
this
lovely
morning
and
tell
you
all
that
has
happened
since
i
left
home
and
my
darling
little
sister
how
i
wish
i
could
give
her
a
hundred
kisses
and
my
dear
father
how
he
would
like
to
hear
about
our
journey
but
i
can
not
see
you
and
talk
to
you
so
i
will
write
and
tell
you
all
that
i
can
think
of
we
did
not
reach
boston
until
saturday
morning
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
our
train
was
delayed
in
several
places
which
made
us
late
in
reaching
new
york
when
we
got
to
jersey
city
at
six
friday
evening
we
were
obliged
to
cross
the
harlem
river
in
a
we
found
the
boat
and
the
transfer
carriage
with
much
less
difficulty
than
teacher
expected
when
we
arrived
at
the
station
they
told
us
that
the
train
did
not
leave
for
boston
until
eleven
but
that
we
could
take
the
sleeper
at
nine
which
we
did
we
went
to
bed
and
slept
until
morning
when
we
awoke
we
were
in
boston
i
was
delighted
to
get
there
though
i
was
much
disappointed
because
we
did
not
arrive
on
birthday
we
surprised
our
dear
friends
however
for
they
did
not
expect
us
saturday
but
when
the
bell
rung
miss
marrett
guessed
who
was
at
the
door
and
hopkins
jumped
up
from
the
breakfast
table
and
ran
to
the
door
to
meet
us
she
was
indeed
much
astonished
to
see
us
after
we
had
had
some
breakfast
we
went
up
to
see
anagnos
i
was
overjoyed
to
see
my
dearest
and
kindest
friend
once
more
he
gave
me
a
beautiful
watch
i
have
it
pinned
to
my
dress
i
tell
everybody
the
time
when
they
ask
me
i
have
only
seen
anagnos
twice
i
have
many
questions
to
ask
him
about
the
countries
he
has
been
travelling
in
but
i
suppose
he
is
very
busy
now
the
hills
in
virginia
were
very
lovely
jack
frost
had
dressed
them
in
gold
and
crimson
the
view
was
most
charmingly
picturesque
pennsylvania
is
a
very
beautiful
state
the
grass
was
as
green
as
though
it
was
springtime
and
the
golden
ears
of
corn
gathered
together
in
heaps
in
the
great
fields
looked
very
pretty
in
harrisburg
we
saw
a
donkey
like
neddy
how
i
wish
i
could
see
my
own
donkey
and
my
dear
lioness
do
they
miss
their
mistress
very
much
tell
mildred
she
must
be
kind
to
them
for
my
sake
our
room
is
pleasant
and
comfortable
my
typewriter
was
much
injured
coming
the
case
was
broken
and
the
keys
are
nearly
all
out
teacher
is
going
to
see
if
it
can
be
fixed
there
are
many
new
books
in
the
library
what
a
nice
time
i
shall
have
reading
them
i
have
already
read
sara
crewe
it
is
a
very
pretty
story
and
i
will
tell
it
to
you
some
time
now
sweet
mother
your
little
girl
must
say
with
much
love
to
father
mildred
you
and
all
the
dear
friends
lovingly
your
little
daughter
helen
keller
to
john
greenleaf
whittier
south
boston
dear
kind
poet
this
is
your
birthday
that
was
the
first
thought
which
came
into
my
mind
when
i
awoke
this
morning
and
it
made
me
glad
to
think
i
could
write
you
a
letter
and
tell
you
how
much
your
little
friends
love
their
sweet
poet
and
his
birthday
this
evening
they
are
going
to
entertain
their
friends
with
readings
from
your
poems
and
music
i
hope
the
swift
winged
messengers
of
love
will
be
here
to
carry
some
of
the
sweet
melody
to
you
in
your
little
study
by
the
merrimac
at
first
i
was
very
sorry
when
i
found
that
the
sun
had
hidden
his
shining
face
behind
dull
clouds
but
afterwards
i
thought
why
he
did
it
and
then
i
was
happy
the
sun
knows
that
you
like
to
see
the
world
covered
with
beautiful
white
snow
and
so
he
kept
back
all
his
brightness
and
let
the
little
crystals
form
in
the
sky
when
they
are
ready
they
will
softly
fall
and
tenderly
cover
every
object
then
the
sun
will
appear
in
all
his
radiance
and
fill
the
world
with
light
if
i
were
with
you
i
would
give
you
kisses
one
for
each
year
you
have
lived
years
seems
very
long
to
me
does
it
seem
long
to
you
i
wonder
how
many
years
there
will
be
in
eternity
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
think
about
so
much
time
i
received
the
letter
which
you
wrote
to
me
last
summer
and
i
thank
you
for
it
i
am
staying
in
boston
now
at
the
institution
for
the
blind
but
i
have
not
commenced
my
studies
yet
because
my
dearest
friend
anagnos
wants
me
to
rest
and
play
a
great
deal
teacher
is
well
and
sends
her
kind
remembrance
to
you
the
happy
christmas
time
is
almost
here
i
can
hardly
wait
for
the
fun
to
begin
i
hope
your
christmas
day
will
be
a
very
happy
one
and
that
the
new
year
will
be
full
of
brightness
and
joy
for
you
and
every
one
from
your
little
friend
helen

whittier

my
dear
young
friend
i
was
very
glad
to
have
such
a
pleasant
letter
on
my
birthday
i
had
two
or
three
hundred
others
and
thine
was
one
of
the
most
welcome
of
all
i
must
tell
thee
about
how
the
day
passed
at
oak
knoll
of
course
the
sun
did
not
shine
but
we
had
great
open
wood
fires
in
the
rooms
which
were
all
very
sweet
with
roses
and
other
flowers
which
were
sent
to
me
from
distant
friends
and
fruits
of
all
kinds
from
california
and
other
places
some
relatives
and
dear
old
friends
were
with
me
through
the
day
i
do
not
wonder
thee
thinks
eighty
three
years
a
long
time
but
to
me
it
seems
but
a
very
little
while
since
i
was
a
boy
no
older
than
thee
playing
on
the
old
farm
at
haverhill
i
thank
thee
for
all
thy
good
wishes

is
an
excellent
place
give
my
best
regards
to
miss
sullivan
and
with
a
great
deal
of
love
i
am
thy
old
friend
john
whittier
tommy
stringer
who
appears
in
several
of
the
following
letters
became
blind
and
deaf
when
he
was
four
years
old
his
mother
was
dead
and
his
father
was
too
poor
to
take
care
of
him
for
a
while
he
was
kept
in
the
general
hospital
at
allegheny
from
here
he
was
to
be
sent
to
an
almshouse
for
at
that
time
there
was
no
other
place
for
him
in
pennsylvania
helen
heard
of
him
through
brown
of
pittsburgh
who
wrote
her
that
he
had
failed
to
secure
a
tutor
for
tommy
she
wanted
him
brought
to
boston
and
when
she
was
told
that
money
would
be
needed
to
get
him
a
teacher
she
answered
we
will
raise
it
she
began
to
solicit
contributions
from
her
friends
and
saved
her
pennies
alexander
graham
bell
advised
tommy
friends
to
send
him
to
boston
and
the
trustees
of
the
perkins
institution
agreed
to
admit
him
to
the
kindergarten
for
the
blind
meanwhile
opportunity
came
to
helen
to
make
a
considerable
contribution
to
tommy
education
the
winter
before
her
dog
lioness
had
been
killed
and
friends
set
to
work
to
raise
money
to
buy
helen
another
dog
helen
asked
that
the
contributions
which
people
were
sending
from
all
over
america
and
england
be
devoted
to
tommy
education
turned
to
this
new
use
the
fund
grew
fast
and
tommy
was
provided
for
he
was
admitted
to
the
kindergarten
on
the
sixth
of
april
miss
keller
wrote
lately
i
shall
never
forget
the
pennies
sent
by
many
a
poor
child
who
could
ill
spare
them
little
tommy
or
the
swift
sympathy
with
which
people
from
far
and
near
whom
i
had
never
seen
responded
to
the
dumb
cry
of
a
little
captive
soul
for
aid
to
george
krehl
institution
for
the
blind
south
boston
march
my
dear
friend
krehl
i
have
just
heard
through
wade
of
your
kind
offer
to
buy
me
a
gentle
dog
and
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
kind
thought
it
makes
me
very
happy
indeed
to
know
that
i
have
such
dear
friends
in
other
lands
it
makes
me
think
that
all
people
are
good
and
loving
i
have
read
that
the
english
and
americans
are
cousins
but
i
am
sure
it
would
be
much
truer
to
say
that
we
are
brothers
and
sisters
my
friends
have
told
me
about
your
great
and
magnificent
city
and
i
have
read
a
great
deal
that
wise
englishmen
have
written
i
have
begun
to
read
enoch
arden
and
i
know
several
of
the
great
poet
poems
by
heart
i
am
eager
to
cross
the
ocean
for
i
want
to
see
my
english
friends
and
their
good
and
wise
queen
once
the
earl
of
meath
came
to
see
me
and
he
told
me
that
the
queen
was
much
beloved
by
her
people
because
of
her
gentleness
and
wisdom
some
day
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
a
little
strange
girl
coming
into
your
office
but
when
you
know
it
is
the
little
girl
who
loves
dogs
and
all
other
animals
you
will
laugh
and
i
hope
you
will
give
her
a
kiss
just
as
wade
does
he
has
another
dog
for
me
and
he
thinks
she
will
be
as
brave
and
faithful
as
my
beautiful
lioness
and
now
i
want
to
tell
you
what
the
dog
lovers
in
america
are
going
to
do
they
are
going
to
send
me
some
money
for
a
poor
little
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
child
his
name
is
tommy
and
he
is
five
years
old
his
parents
are
too
poor
to
pay
to
have
the
little
fellow
sent
to
school
so
instead
of
giving
me
a
dog
the
gentlemen
are
going
to
help
make
tommy
life
as
bright
and
joyous
as
mine
is
it
not
a
beautiful
plan
education
will
bring
light
and
music
into
tommy
soul
and
then
he
can
not
help
being
happy
from
your
loving
little
friend
helen
keller
to
oliver
wendell
holmes
south
boston
april
dear
holmes
your
beautiful
words
about
spring
have
been
making
music
in
my
heart
these
bright
april
days
i
love
every
word
of
spring
and
spring
has
come
i
think
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
these
poems
have
taught
me
to
enjoy
and
love
the
beautiful
springtime
even
though
i
can
not
see
the
fair
frail
blossoms
which
proclaim
its
approach
or
hear
the
joyous
warbling
of
the
birds
but
when
i
read
spring
has
come
lo
i
am
not
blind
any
longer
for
i
see
with
your
eyes
and
hear
with
your
ears
sweet
mother
nature
can
have
no
secrets
from
me
when
my
poet
is
near
i
have
chosen
this
paper
because
i
want
the
spray
of
violets
in
the
corner
to
tell
you
of
my
grateful
love
i
want
you
to
see
baby
tom
the
little
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
child
who
has
just
come
to
our
pretty
garden
he
is
poor
and
helpless
and
lonely
now
but
before
another
april
education
will
have
brought
light
and
gladness
into
tommy
life
if
you
do
come
you
will
want
to
ask
the
kind
people
of
boston
to
help
brighten
tommy
whole
life
your
loving
friend
helen
keller
to
sir
john
everett
millais
perkins
institution
for
the
blind
south
boston
april
my
dear
millais
your
little
american
sister
is
going
to
write
you
a
letter
because
she
wants
you
to
know
how
pleased
she
was
to
hear
you
were
interested
in
our
poor
little
tommy
and
had
sent
some
money
to
help
educate
him
it
is
very
beautiful
to
think
that
people
far
away
in
england
feel
sorry
for
a
little
helpless
child
in
america
i
used
to
think
when
i
read
in
my
books
about
your
great
city
that
when
i
visited
it
the
people
would
be
strangers
to
me
but
now
i
feel
differently
it
seems
to
me
that
all
people
who
have
loving
pitying
hearts
are
not
strangers
to
each
other
i
can
hardly
wait
patiently
for
the
time
to
come
when
i
shall
see
my
dear
english
friends
and
their
beautiful
island
home
my
favourite
poet
has
written
some
lines
about
england
which
i
love
very
much
i
think
you
will
like
them
too
so
i
will
try
to
write
them
for
you
hugged
in
the
clinging
billow
clasp
from
seaweed
fringe
to
mountain
heather
the
british
oak
with
rooted
grasp
her
slender
handful
holds
together
with
cliffs
of
white
and
bowers
of
green
and
ocean
narrowing
to
caress
her
and
hills
and
threaded
streams
between
our
little
mother
isle
god
bless
her
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
tommy
has
a
kind
lady
to
teach
him
and
that
he
is
a
pretty
active
little
fellow
he
loves
to
climb
much
better
than
to
spell
but
that
is
because
he
does
not
know
yet
what
a
wonderful
thing
language
is
he
can
not
imagine
how
very
very
happy
he
will
be
when
he
can
tell
us
his
thoughts
and
we
can
tell
him
how
we
have
loved
him
so
long
tomorrow
april
will
hide
her
tears
and
blushes
beneath
the
flowers
of
lovely
may
i
wonder
if
the
in
england
are
as
beautiful
as
they
are
here
now
i
must
say
please
think
of
me
always
as
your
loving
little
sister
helen
keller
to
rev
phillips
brooks
so
boston
may
my
dear
brooks
helen
sends
you
a
loving
greeting
this
bright
my
teacher
has
just
told
me
that
you
have
been
made
a
bishop
and
that
your
friends
everywhere
are
rejoicing
because
one
whom
they
love
has
been
greatly
honored
i
do
not
understand
very
well
what
a
bishop
work
is
but
i
am
sure
it
must
be
good
and
helpful
and
i
am
glad
that
my
dear
friend
is
brave
and
wise
and
loving
enough
to
do
it
it
is
very
beautiful
to
think
that
you
can
tell
so
many
people
of
the
heavenly
father
tender
love
for
all
his
children
even
when
they
are
not
gentle
and
noble
as
he
wishes
them
to
be
i
hope
the
glad
news
which
you
will
tell
them
will
make
their
hearts
beat
fast
with
joy
and
love
i
hope
too
that
bishop
brooks
whole
life
will
be
as
rich
in
happiness
as
the
month
of
may
is
full
of
blossoms
and
singing
birds
from
your
loving
little
friend
helen
keller
before
a
teacher
was
found
for
tommy
and
while
he
was
still
in
the
care
of
helen
and
miss
sullivan
a
reception
was
held
for
him
at
the
kindergarten
at
helen
request
bishop
brooks
made
an
address
helen
wrote
letters
to
the
newspapers
which
brought
many
generous
replies
all
of
these
she
answered
herself
and
she
made
public
acknowledgment
in
letters
to
the
newspapers
this
letter
is
to
the
editor
of
the
boston
herald
enclosing
a
complete
list
of
the
subscribers
the
contributions
amounted
to
more
than
sixteen
hundred
dollars
to
john
holmes
south
boston
may
editor
of
the
boston
herald
my
dear
holmes
will
you
kindly
print
in
the
herald
the
enclosed
list
i
think
the
readers
of
your
paper
will
be
glad
to
know
that
so
much
has
been
done
for
dear
little
tommy
and
that
they
will
all
wish
to
share
in
the
pleasure
of
helping
him
he
is
very
happy
indeed
at
the
kindergarten
and
is
learning
something
every
day
he
has
found
out
that
doors
have
locks
and
that
little
sticks
and
bits
of
paper
can
be
got
into
the
quite
easily
but
he
does
not
seem
very
eager
to
get
them
out
after
they
are
in
he
loves
to
climb
the
and
unscrew
the
steam
valves
much
better
than
to
spell
but
that
is
because
he
does
not
understand
that
words
would
help
him
to
make
new
and
interesting
discoveries
i
hope
that
good
people
will
continue
to
work
for
tommy
until
his
fund
is
completed
and
education
has
brought
light
and
music
into
his
little
life
from
your
little
friend
helen
keller
to
oliver
wendell
holmes
south
boston
may
dear
gentle
poet
i
fear
that
you
will
think
helen
a
very
troublesome
little
girl
if
she
writes
to
you
too
often
but
how
is
she
to
help
sending
you
loving
and
grateful
messages
when
you
do
so
much
to
make
her
glad
i
can
not
begin
to
tell
you
how
delighted
i
was
when
anagnos
told
me
that
you
had
sent
him
some
money
to
help
educate
baby
tom
then
i
knew
that
you
had
not
forgotten
the
dear
little
child
for
the
gift
brought
with
it
the
thought
of
tender
sympathy
i
am
very
sorry
to
say
that
tommy
has
not
learned
any
words
yet
he
is
the
same
restless
little
creature
he
was
when
you
saw
him
but
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
he
is
happy
and
playful
in
his
bright
new
home
and
by
and
by
that
strange
wonderful
thing
teacher
calls
mind
will
begin
to
spread
its
beautiful
wings
and
fly
away
in
search
of
words
are
the
mind
wings
are
they
not
i
have
been
to
andover
since
i
saw
you
and
i
was
greatly
interested
in
all
that
my
friends
told
me
about
phillips
academy
because
i
knew
you
had
been
there
and
i
felt
it
was
a
place
dear
to
you
i
tried
to
imagine
my
gentle
poet
when
he
was
a
and
i
wondered
if
it
was
in
andover
he
learned
the
songs
of
the
birds
and
the
secrets
of
the
shy
little
woodland
children
i
am
sure
his
heart
was
always
full
of
music
and
in
god
beautiful
world
he
must
have
heard
love
sweet
replying
when
i
came
home
teacher
read
to
me
the
for
it
is
not
in
our
print
did
you
know
that
the
blind
children
are
going
to
have
their
commencement
exercises
in
tremont
temple
next
tuesday
afternoon
i
enclose
a
ticket
hoping
that
you
will
come
we
shall
all
be
proud
and
happy
to
welcome
our
poet
friend
i
shall
recite
about
the
beautiful
cities
of
sunny
italy
i
hope
our
kind
friend
ellis
will
come
too
and
take
tom
in
his
arms
with
much
love
and
a
kiss
from
your
little
friend
helen
keller
to
rev
phillips
brooks
south
boston
june
my
dear
brooks
i
send
you
my
picture
as
i
promised
and
i
hope
when
you
look
at
it
this
summer
your
thoughts
will
fly
southward
to
your
happy
little
friend
i
used
to
wish
that
i
could
see
pictures
with
my
hands
as
i
do
statues
but
now
i
do
not
often
think
about
it
because
my
dear
father
has
filled
my
mind
with
beautiful
pictures
even
of
things
i
can
not
see
if
the
light
were
not
in
your
eyes
dear
brooks
you
would
understand
better
how
happy
your
little
helen
was
when
her
teacher
explained
to
her
that
the
best
and
most
beautiful
things
in
the
world
can
not
be
seen
nor
even
touched
but
just
felt
in
the
heart
every
day
i
find
out
something
which
makes
me
glad
yesterday
i
thought
for
the
first
time
what
a
beautiful
thing
motion
was
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
everything
was
trying
to
get
near
to
god
does
it
seem
that
way
to
you
it
is
sunday
morning
and
while
i
sit
here
in
the
library
writing
this
letter
you
are
teaching
hundreds
of
people
some
of
the
grand
and
beautiful
things
about
their
heavenly
father
are
you
not
very
very
happy
and
when
you
are
a
bishop
you
will
preach
to
more
people
and
more
and
more
will
be
made
glad
teacher
sends
her
kind
remembrances
and
i
send
you
with
my
picture
my
dear
love
from
your
little
friend
helen
keller
when
the
perkins
institution
closed
in
june
helen
and
her
teacher
went
south
to
tuscumbia
where
they
remained
until
december
there
is
a
hiatus
of
several
months
in
the
letters
caused
by
the
depressing
effect
on
helen
and
miss
sullivan
of
the
frost
king
episode
at
the
time
this
trouble
seemed
very
grave
and
brought
them
much
unhappiness
an
analysis
of
the
case
has
been
made
elsewhere
and
miss
keller
has
written
her
account
of
it
to
albert
munsell
brewster
mar
my
dear
munsell
surely
i
need
not
tell
you
that
your
letter
was
very
welcome
i
enjoyed
every
word
of
it
and
wished
that
it
was
longer
i
laughed
when
you
spoke
of
old
neptune
wild
moods
he
has
in
truth
behaved
very
strangely
ever
since
we
came
to
brewster
it
is
evident
that
something
has
displeased
his
majesty
but
i
can
not
imagine
what
it
can
be
his
expression
has
been
so
turbulent
that
i
have
feared
to
give
him
your
kind
message
who
knows
perhaps
the
old
sea
god
as
he
lay
asleep
upon
the
shore
heard
the
soft
music
of
growing
things
the
stir
of
life
in
the
earth
bosom
and
his
stormy
heart
was
angry
because
he
knew
that
his
and
winter
reign
was
almost
at
an
end
so
together
the
unhappy
monarch
s
fought
most
despairingly
thinking
that
gentle
spring
would
turn
and
fly
at
the
very
sight
of
the
havoc
caused
by
their
forces
but
lo
the
lovely
maiden
only
smiles
more
sweetly
and
breathes
upon
the
icy
battlements
of
her
enemies
and
in
a
moment
they
vanish
and
the
glad
earth
gives
her
a
royal
welcome
but
i
must
put
away
these
idle
fancies
until
we
meet
again
please
give
your
dear
mother
my
love
teacher
wishes
me
to
say
that
she
liked
the
photograph
very
much
and
she
will
see
about
having
some
when
we
return
now
dear
friend
please
accept
these
few
words
because
of
the
love
that
is
linked
with
them
lovingly
yours
helen
keller
this
letter
was
reproduced
in
facsimile
in
nicholas
june
it
is
undated
but
must
have
been
written
two
or
three
months
before
it
was
published
to
nicholas
dear
nicholas
it
gives
me
very
great
pleasure
to
send
you
my
autograph
because
i
want
the
boys
and
girls
who
read
nicholas
to
know
how
blind
children
write
i
suppose
some
of
them
wonder
how
we
keep
the
lines
so
straight
so
i
will
try
to
tell
them
how
it
is
done
we
have
a
grooved
board
which
we
put
between
the
pages
when
we
wish
to
write
the
parallel
grooves
correspond
to
lines
and
when
we
have
pressed
the
paper
into
them
by
means
of
the
blunt
end
of
the
pencil
it
is
very
easy
to
keep
the
words
even
the
small
letters
are
all
made
in
the
grooves
while
the
long
ones
extend
above
and
below
them
we
guide
the
pencil
with
the
right
hand
and
feel
carefully
with
the
forefinger
of
the
left
hand
to
see
that
we
shape
and
space
the
letters
correctly
it
is
very
difficult
at
first
to
form
them
plainly
but
if
we
keep
on
trying
it
gradually
becomes
easier
and
after
a
great
deal
of
practice
we
can
write
legible
letters
to
our
friends
then
we
are
very
very
happy
sometime
they
may
visit
a
school
for
the
blind
if
they
do
i
am
sure
they
will
wish
to
see
the
pupils
write
very
sincerely
your
little
friend
helen
keller
in
may
helen
gave
a
tea
in
aid
of
the
kindergarten
for
the
blind
it
was
quite
her
own
idea
and
was
given
in
the
house
of
mahlon
spaulding
sister
of
john
spaulding
one
of
helen
kindest
and
most
liberal
friends
the
tea
brought
more
than
two
thousand
dollars
for
the
blind
children
to
miss
caroline
derby
south
boston
may
my
dear
miss
carrie
i
was
much
pleased
to
receive
your
kind
letter
need
i
tell
you
that
i
was
more
than
delighted
to
hear
that
you
are
really
interested
in
the
tea
of
course
we
must
not
give
it
up
very
soon
i
am
going
far
away
to
my
own
dear
home
in
the
sunny
south
and
it
would
always
make
me
happy
to
think
that
the
last
thing
which
my
dear
friends
in
boston
did
for
my
pleasure
was
to
help
make
the
lives
of
many
little
sightless
children
good
and
happy
i
know
that
kind
people
can
not
help
feeling
a
tender
sympathy
for
the
little
ones
who
can
not
see
the
beautiful
light
or
any
of
the
wonderful
things
which
give
them
pleasure
and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
loving
sympathy
must
express
itself
in
acts
of
kindness
and
when
the
friends
of
little
helpless
blind

lovingly
yours
helen
keller
to
john
spaulding
south
boston
may
my
dear
spaulding
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
your
little
friend
helen
very
troublesome
when
you
read
this
letter
but
i
am
sure
you
will
not
blame
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
very
anxious
about
something
you
remember
teacher
and
i
told
you
sunday
that
i
wanted
to
have
a
little
tea
in
aid
of
the
kindergarten
we
thought
everything
was
arranged
but
we
found
monday
that
elliott
would
not
be
willing
to
let
us
invite
more
than
fifty
people
because
howe
house
is
quite
small
i
am
sure
that
a
great
many
people
would
like
to
come
to
the
tea
and
help
me
do
something
to
brighten
the
lives
of
little
blind
children
but
some
of
my
friends
say
that
i
shall
have
to
give
up
the
idea
of
having
a
tea
unless
we
can
find
another
house
teacher
said
yesterday
that
perhaps
spaulding
would
be
willing
to
let
us
have
her
beautiful
house
and
i
thought
i
would
ask
you
about
it
do
you
think
spaulding
would
help
me
if
i
wrote
to
her
i
shall
be
so
disappointed
if
my
little
plans
fail
because
i
have
wanted
for
a
long
time
to
do
something
for
the
poor
little
ones
who
are
waiting
to
enter
the
kindergarten
please
let
me
know
what
you
think
about
the
house
and
try
to
forgive
me
for
troubling
you
so
much
lovingly
your
little
friend
helen
keller
to
edward
clement
south
boston
may
my
dear
clement
i
am
going
to
write
to
you
this
beautiful
morning
because
my
heart
is
brimful
of
happiness
and
i
want
you
and
all
my
dear
friends
in
the
transcript
office
to
rejoice
with
me
the
preparations
for
my
tea
are
nearly
completed
and
i
am
looking
forward
joyfully
to
the
event
i
know
i
shall
not
fail
kind
people
will
not
disappoint
me
when
they
know
that
i
plead
for
helpless
little
children
who
live
in
darkness
and
ignorance
they
will
come
to
my
tea
and
buy
light
the
beautiful
light
of
knowledge
and
love
for
many
little
ones
who
are
blind
and
friendless
i
remember
perfectly
when
my
dear
teacher
came
to
me
then
i
was
like
the
little
blind
children
who
are
waiting
to
enter
the
kindergarten
there
was
no
light
in
my
soul
this
wonderful
world
with
all
its
sunlight
and
beauty
was
hidden
from
me
and
i
had
never
dreamed
of
its
loveliness
but
teacher
came
to
me
and
taught
my
little
fingers
to
use
the
beautiful
key
that
has
unlocked
the
door
of
my
dark
prison
and
set
my
spirit
free
it
is
my
earnest
wish
to
share
my
happiness
with
others
and
i
ask
the
kind
people
of
boston
to
help
me
make
the
lives
of
little
blind
children
brighter
and
happier
lovingly
your
little
friend
helen
keller
at
the
end
of
june
miss
sullivan
and
helen
went
home
to
tuscumbia
to
miss
caroline
derby
tuscumbia
alabama
july
my
dear
carrie
you
are
to
look
upon
it
as
a
most
positive
proof
of
my
love
that
i
write
to
you
for
a
whole
week
it
has
been
cold
and
dark
and
dreary
in
tuscumbia
and
i
must
confess
the
continuous
rain
and
dismalness
of
the
weather
fills
me
with
gloomy
thoughts
and
makes
the
writing
of
letters
or
any
pleasant
employment
seem
quite
impossible
nevertheless
i
must
tell
you
that
we
are
alive
that
we
reached
home
safely
and
that
we
speak
of
you
daily
and
enjoy
your
interesting
letters
very
much
i
had
a
beautiful
visit
at
hulton
everything
was
fresh
and
and
we
stayed
out
of
doors
all
day
we
even
ate
our
breakfast
out
on
the
piazza
sometimes
we
sat
in
the
hammock
and
teacher
read
to
me
i
rode
horseback
nearly
every
evening
and
once
i
rode
five
miles
at
a
fast
gallop
o
it
was
great
fun
do
you
like
to
ride
i
have
a
very
pretty
little
cart
now
and
if
it
ever
stops
raining
teacher
and
i
are
going
to
drive
every
evening
and
i
have
another
beautiful
mastiff
the
largest
one
i
ever
saw
and
he
will
go
along
to
protect
us
his
name
is
eumer
a
queer
name
is
it
not
i
think
it
is
saxon
we
expect
to
go
to
the
mountains
next
week
my
little
brother
phillips
is
not
well
and
we
think
the
clear
mountain
air
will
benefit
him
mildred
is
a
sweet
little
sister
and
i
am
sure
you
would
love
her
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
photograph
i
like
to
have
my
friends
pictures
even
though
i
can
not
see
them
i
was
greatly
amused
at
the
idea
of
your
writing
the
square
hand
i
do
not
write
on
a
braille
tablet
as
you
suppose
but
on
a
grooved
board
like
the
piece
which
i
enclose
you
could
not
read
braille
for
it
is
written
in
dots
not
at
all
like
ordinary
letters
please
give
my
love
to
miss
derby
and
tell
her
that
i
hope
she
gave
my
sweetest
love
to
baby
ruth
what
was
the
book
you
sent
me
for
my
birthday
i
received
several
and
i
do
not
know
which
was
from
you
i
had
one
gift
which
especially
pleased
me
it
was
a
lovely
cape
crocheted
for
me
by
an
old
gentleman
years
of
age
and
every
stitch
he
writes
represents
a
kind
wish
for
my
health
and
happiness
tell
your
little
cousins
i
think
they
had
better
get
upon
the
fence
with
me
until
after
the
election
for
there
are
so
many
parties
and
candidates
that
i
doubt
if
such
youthful
politicians
would
make
a
wise
selection
please
give
my
love
to
rosy
when
you
write
and
believe
me
your
loving
friend
helen
keller
how
do
you
like
this
letter
to
grover
cleveland

dear
cleveland

going
to
write

little
letter
this
beautiful
morning

little
ruth

much

wish

loving

very
glad
that
such
a
kind
beautiful
lady
loves
me
i
have
loved
you
for
a
long
time

i
did
not
think
you
had
ever
heard
of
me
until
your
sweet
message
came
please
kiss
your
dear
little
baby
for
me
and
tell
her
i
have
a
little
brother
nearly
sixteen
months
old
his
name
is
phillips
brooks
i
named
him
myself
after
my
dear
friend
phillips
brooks
i
send
you
with
this
letter
a
pretty
book
which
my
teacher
thinks
will
interest
you
and
my
picture
please
accept
them
with
the
love
and
good
wishes
of
your
friend
helen

november
fourth
hitherto
the
letters
have
been
given
in
full
from
this
point
on
passages
are
omitted
and
the
omissions
are
indicated
to
john
hitz
tuscumbia
alabama
my
dear
hitz
i
hardly
know
how
to
begin
a
letter
to
you
it
has
been
such
a
long
time
since
your
kind
letter
reached
me
and
there
is
so
much
that
i
would
like
to
write
if
i
could
you
must
have
wondered
why
your
letter
has
not
had
an
answer
and
perhaps
you
have
thought
teacher
and
me
very
naughty
indeed
if
so
you
will
be
very
sorry
when
i
tell
you
something
teacher
eyes
have
been
hurting
her
so
that
she
could
not
write
to
any
one
and
i
have
been
trying
to
fulfil
a
promise
which
i
made
last
summer
before
i
left
boston
i
was
asked
to
write
a
sketch
of
my
life
for
the
companion
i
had
intended
to
write
the
sketch
during
my
vacation
but
i
was
not
well
and
i
did
not
feel
able
to
write
even
to
my
friends
but
when
the
bright
pleasant
autumn
days
came
and
i
felt
strong
again
i
began
to
think
about
the
sketch
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
plan
it
to
suit
me
you
see
it
is
not
very
pleasant
to
write
all
about
one
self
at
last
however
i
got
something
bit
by
bit
that
teacher
thought
would
do
and
i
set
about
putting
the
scraps
together
which
was
not
an
easy
task
for
although
i
worked
some
on
it
every
day
i
did
not
finish
it
until
a
week
ago
saturday
i
sent
the
sketch
to
the
companion
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
but
i
do
not
know
that
they
will
accept
it
since
then
i
have
not
been
well
and
i
have
been
obliged
to
keep
very
quiet
and
rest
but
i
am
better
and
i
shall
be
well
again
i
hope
the
reports
which
you
have
read
in
the
paper
about
me
are
not
true
at
all
we
received
the
silent
worker
which
you
sent
and
i
wrote
right
away
to
the
editor
to
tell
him
that
it
was
a
mistake
sometimes
i
am
not
well
but
i
am
not
a
wreck
and
there
is
nothing
distressing
about
my
condition
i
enjoyed
your
dear
letter
so
much
i
am
always
delighted
when
anyone
writes
me
a
beautiful
thought
which
i
can
treasure
in
my
memory
forever
it
is
because
my
books
are
full
of
the
riches
of
which
ruskin
speaks
that
i
love
them
so
dearly
i
did
not
realize
until
i
began
to
write
the
sketch
for
the
companion
what
precious
companions
books
have
been
to
me
and
how
blessed
even
my
life
has
been
and
now
i
am
happier
than
ever
because
i
do
realize
the
happiness
that
has
come
to
me
i
hope
you
will
write
to
me
as
often
as
you
can
teacher
and
i
are
always
delighted
to
hear
from
you
i
want
to
write
to
bell
and
send
him
my
picture
i
suppose
he
has
been
too
busy
to
write
to
his
little
friend
i
often
think
of
the
pleasant
time
we
had
all
together
in
boston
last
spring
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
secret
i
think
we
teacher
and
my
father
and
little
sister
and
myself
will
visit
washington
next
march
then
i
shall
see
you
and
dear
bell
and
elsie
and
daisy
again
would
not
it
be
lovely
if
pratt
could
meet
us
there
i
think
i
will
write
to
her
and
tell
her
the
secret
too
lovingly
your
little
friend
helen
keller
teacher
says
you
want
to
know
what
kind
of
a
pet
i
would
like
to
have
i
love
all
living
things
i
suppose
everyone
does
but
of
course
i
can
not
have
a
menagerie
i
have
a
beautiful
pony
and
a
large
dog
and
i
would
like
a
little
dog
to
hold
in
my
lap
or
a
big
pussy
there
are
no
fine
cats
in
tuscumbia
or
a
parrot
i
would
like
to
feel
a
parrot
talk
it
would
be
so
much
fun
but
i
would
be
pleased
with
and
love
any
little
creature
you
send
me
to
miss
caroline
derby
tuscumbia
alabama
february
you
have
often
been
in
my
thoughts
during
these
sad
days
while
my
heart
has
been
grieving
over
the
loss
of
my
beloved
friend
phillips
brooks
died
january
and
i
have
wished
many
times
that
i
was
in
boston
with
those
who
knew
and
loved
him
as
i
did
he
was
so
much
of
a
friend
to
me
so
tender
and
loving
always
i
do
try
not
to
mourn
his
death
too
sadly
i
do
try
to
think
that
he
is
still
near
very
near
but
sometimes
the
thought
that
he
is
not
here
that
i
shall
not
see
him
when
i
go
to
boston
that
he
is
gone
rushes
over
my
soul
like
a
great
wave
of
sorrow
but
at
other
times
when
i
am
happier
i
do
feel
his
beautiful
presence
and
his
loving
hand
leading
me
in
pleasant
ways
do
you
remember
the
happy
hour
we
spent
with
him
last
june
when
he
held
my
hand
as
he
always
did
and
talked
to
us
about
his
friend
tennyson
and
our
own
dear
poet
holmes
and
i
tried
to
teach
him
the
manual
alphabet
and
he
laughed
so
gaily
over
his
mistakes
and
afterward
i
told
him
about
my
tea
and
he
promised
to
come
i
can
hear
him
now
saying
in
his
cheerful
decided
way
in
reply
to
my
wish
that
my
tea
might
be
a
success
of
course
it
will
helen
put
your
whole
heart
in
the
good
work
my
child
and
it
can
not
fail
i
am
glad
the
people
are
going
to
raise
a
monument
to
his
memory
in
march
helen
and
miss
sullivan
went
north
and
spent
the
next
few
months
traveling
and
visiting
friends
in
reading
this
letter
about
niagara
one
should
remember
that
miss
keller
knows
distance
and
shape
and
that
the
size
of
niagara
is
within
her
experience
after
she
has
explored
it
crossed
the
bridge
and
gone
down
in
the
elevator
especially
important
are
such
details
as
her
feeling
the
rush
of
the
water
by
putting
her
hand
on
the
window
bell
gave
her
a
down
pillow
which
she
held
against
her
to
increase
the
vibrations
to
kate
adams
keller
south
boston
april
teacher
pratt
and
i
very
unexpectedly
decided
to
take
a
journey
with
dear
bell
westervelt
a
gentleman
whom
father
met
in
washington
has
a
school
for
the
deaf
in
rochester
we
went
there
first
westervelt
gave
us
a
reception
one
afternoon
a
great
many
people
came
some
of
them
asked
odd
questions
a
lady
seemed
surprised
that
i
loved
flowers
when
i
could
not
see
their
beautiful
colors
and
when
i
assured
her
i
did
love
them
she
said
no
doubt
you
feel
the
colors
with
your
fingers
but
of
course
it
is
not
alone
for
their
bright
colors
that
we
love
the
flowers
a
gentleman
asked
me
what
beauty
meant
to
my
mind
i
must
confess
i
was
puzzled
at
first
but
after
a
minute
i
answered
that
beauty
was
a
form
of
goodness
and
he
went
away
when
the
reception
was
over
we
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
teacher
slept
quite
unconscious
of
the
surprise
which
was
in
store
for
her
bell
and
i
planned
it
together
and
bell
made
all
the
arrangements
before
we
told
teacher
anything
about
it
this
was
the
surprise
i
was
to
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
my
dear
teacher
to
see
niagara
falls
the
hotel
was
so
near
the
river
that
i
could
feel
it
rushing
past
by
putting
my
hand
on
the
window
the
next
morning
the
sun
rose
bright
and
warm
and
we
got
up
quickly
for
our
hearts
were
full
of
pleasant
expectation
you
can
never
imagine
how
i
felt
when
i
stood
in
the
presence
of
niagara
until
you
have
the
same
mysterious
sensations
yourself
i
could
hardly
realize
that
it
was
water
that
i
felt
rushing
and
plunging
with
impetuous
fury
at
my
feet
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
some
living
thing
rushing
on
to
some
terrible
fate
i
wish
i
could
describe
the
cataract
as
it
is
its
beauty
and
awful
grandeur
and
the
fearful
and
irresistible
plunge
of
its
waters
over
the
brow
of
the
precipice
one
feels
helpless
and
overwhelmed
in
the
presence
of
such
a
vast
force
i
had
the
same
feeling
once
before
when
i
first
stood
by
the
great
ocean
and
felt
its
waves
beating
against
the
shore
i
suppose
you
feel
so
too
when
you
gaze
up
to
the
stars
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
do
you
not
we
went
down
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
in
an
elevator
that
we
might
see
the
violent
eddies
and
whirlpools
in
the
deep
gorge
below
the
falls
within
two
miles
of
the
falls
is
a
wonderful
suspension
bridge
it
is
thrown
across
the
gorge
at
a
height
of
two
hundred
and
feet
above
the
water
and
is
supported
on
each
bank
by
towers
of
solid
rock
which
are
eight
hundred
feet
apart
when
we
crossed
over
to
the
canadian
side
i
cried
god
save
the
queen
teacher
said
i
was
a
little
traitor
but
i
do
not
think
so
i
was
only
doing
as
the
canadians
do
while
i
was
in
their
country
and
besides
i
honor
england
good
queen
you
will
be
pleased
dear
mother
to
hear
that
a
kind
lady
whose
name
is
miss
hooker
is
endeavoring
to
improve
my
speech
oh
i
do
so
hope
and
pray
that
i
shall
speak
well
some
day
munsell
spent
last
sunday
evening
with
us
how
you
would
have
enjoyed
hearing
him
tell
about
venice
his
beautiful
made
us
feel
as
if
we
were
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
san
marco
dreaming
or
sailing
upon
the
moonlit
canal
i
hope
when
i
visit
venice
as
i
surely
shall
some
day
that
munsell
will
go
with
me
that
is
my
castle
in
the
air
you
see
none
of
my
friends
describe
things
to
me
so
vividly
and
so
beautifully
as
he
does
her
visit
to
the
world
fair
she
described
in
a
letter
to
john
spaulding
which
was
published
in
nicholas
and
is
much
like
the
following
letter
in
a
prefatory
note
which
miss
sullivan
wrote
for
nicholas
she
says
that
people
frequently
said
to
her
helen
sees
more
with
her
fingers
than
we
do
with
our
eyes
the
president
of
the
exposition
gave
her
this
letter
to
the
chiefs
of
the
departments
and
officers
in
charge
of
buildings
and
exhibits
gentlemen
the
bearer
miss
helen
keller
accompanied
by
miss
sullivan
is
desirous
of
making
a
complete
inspection
of
the
exposition
in
all
departments
she
is
blind
and
deaf
but
is
able
to
converse
and
is
introduced
to
me
as
one
having
a
wonderful
ability
to
understand
the
objects
she
visits
and
as
being
possessed
of
a
high
order
of
intelligence
and
of
culture
beyond
her
years
please
favour
her
with
every
facility
to
examine
the
exhibits
in
the
several
departments
and
extend
to
her
such
other
courtesies
as
may
be
possible
thanking
you
in
advance
for
the
same
i
am
with
respect
very
truly
yours
signed
higinbotham
president
to
miss
caroline
derby
hulton
august
every
one
at
the
fair
was
very
kind
to
me
nearly
all
of
the
exhibitors
seemed
perfectly
willing
to
let
me
touch
the
most
delicate
things
and
they
were
very
nice
about
explaining
everything
to
me
a
french
gentleman
whose
name
i
can
not
remember
showed
me
the
great
french
bronzes
i
believe
they
gave
me
more
pleasure
than
anything
else
at
the
fair
they
were
so
lifelike
and
wonderful
to
my
touch
bell
went
with
us
himself
to
the
electrical
building
and
showed
us
some
of
the
historical
telephones
i
saw
the
one
through
which
emperor
dom
pedro
listened
to
the
words
to
be
or
not
to
be
at
the
centennial
gillett
of
illinois
took
us
to
the
liberal
arts
and
buildings
in
the
former
i
visited
tiffany
exhibit
and
held
the
beautiful
tiffany
diamond
which
is
valued
at
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
touched
many
other
rare
and
costly
things
i
sat
in
king
ludwig
armchair
and
felt
like
a
queen
when
gillett
remarked
that
i
had
many
loyal
subjects
at
the
building
we
met
the
princess
maria
schaovskoy
of
russia
and
a
beautiful
syrian
lady
i
liked
them
both
very
much
i
went
to
the
japanese
department
with
morse
who
is
a
lecturer
i
never
realized
what
a
wonderful
people
the
japanese
are
until
i
saw
their
most
interesting
exhibit
japan
must
indeed
be
a
paradise
for
children
to
judge
from
the
great
number
of
playthings
which
are
manufactured
there
the
japanese
musical
instruments
and
their
beautiful
works
of
art
were
interesting
the
japanese
books
are
very
odd
there
are
letters
in
their
alphabets
morse
knows
a
great
deal
about
japan
and
is
very
kind
and
wise
he
invited
me
to
visit
his
museum
in
salem
the
next
time
i
go
to
boston
but
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
sails
on
the
tranquil
lagoon
and
the
lovely
scenes
as
my
friends
described
them
to
me
more
than
anything
else
at
the
fair
once
while
we
were
out
on
the
water
the
sun
went
down
over
the
rim
of
the
earth
and
threw
a
soft
rosy
light
over
the
white
city
making
it
look
more
than
ever
like
dreamland
of
course
we
visited
the
midway
plaisance
it
was
a
bewildering
and
fascinating
place
i
went
into
the
streets
of
cairo
and
rode
on
the
camel
that
was
fine
fun
we
also
rode
in
the
ferris
wheel
and
on
the
and
had
a
sail
in
the
in
the
spring
of
a
club
was
started
in
tuscumbia
of
which
keller
was
president
to
establish
a
public
library
miss
keller
says
i
wrote
to
my
friends
about
the
work
and
enlisted
their
sympathy
several
hundred
books
including
many
fine
ones
were
sent
to
me
in
a
short
time
as
well
as
money
and
encouragement
this
generous
assistance
encouraged
the
ladies
and
they
have
gone
on
collecting
and
buying
books
ever
since
until
now
they
have
a
very
respectable
public
library
in
the
town
to
charles
inches
hulton
we
spent
september
at
home
in
tuscumbia
and
were
all
very
happy
together
our
quiet
mountain
home
was
especially
attractive
and
restful
after
the
excitement
and
fatigue
of
our
visit
to
the
world
fair
we
enjoyed
the
beauty
and
solitude
of
the
hills
more
than
ever
and
now
we
are
in
hulton
penn
again
where
i
am
going
to
study
this
winter
with
a
tutor
assisted
by
my
dear
teacher
i
study
arithmetic
latin
and
literature
i
enjoy
my
lessons
very
much
it
is
so
pleasant
to
learn
about
new
things
every
day
i
find
how
little
i
know
but
i
do
not
feel
discouraged
since
god
has
given
me
an
eternity
in
which
to
learn
more
in
literature
i
am
studying
longfellow
poetry
i
know
a
great
deal
of
it
by
heart
for
i
loved
it
long
before
i
knew
a
metaphor
from
a
synecdoche
i
used
to
say
i
did
not
like
arithmetic
very
well
but
now
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
see
what
a
good
and
useful
study
it
is
though
i
must
confess
my
mind
wanders
from
it
sometimes
for
nice
and
useful
as
arithmetic
is
it
is
not
as
interesting
as
a
beautiful
poem
or
a
lovely
story
but
bless
me
how
time
does
fly
i
have
only
a
few
moments
left
in
which
to
answer
your
questions
about
the
helen
keller
public
library
i
think
there
are
about
people
in
tuscumbia
and
perhaps
half
of
them
are
colored
people
at
present
there
is
no
library
of
any
sort
in
the
town
that
is
why
i
thought
about
starting
one
my
mother
and
several
of
my
lady
friends
said
they
would
help
me
and
they
formed
a
club
the
object
of
which
is
to
work
for
the
establishment
of
a
free
public
library
in
tuscumbia
they
have
now
about
books
and
about
in
money
and
a
kind
gentleman
has
given
us
land
on
which
to
erect
a
library
building
but
in
the
meantime
the
club
has
rented
a
little
room
in
a
central
part
of
the
town
and
the
books
which
we
already
have
are
free
to
all
only
a
few
of
my
kind
friends
in
boston
know
anything
about
the
library
i
did
not
like
to
trouble
them
while
i
was
trying
to
get
money
for
poor
little
tommy
for
of
course
it
was
more
important
that
he
should
be
educated
than
that
my
people
should
have
books
to
read
i
do
not
know
what
books
we
have
but
i
think
it
is
a
miscellaneous
i
think
that
is
the
word
collection
my
teacher
thinks
it
would
be
more
businesslike
to
say
that
a
list
of
the
contributors
toward
the
building
fund
will
be
kept
and
published
in
my
father
paper
the
north
alabamian
to
miss
caroline
derby
hulton
december
please
thank
dear
miss
derby
for
me
for
the
pretty
shield
which
she
sent
me
it
is
a
very
interesting
souvenir
of
columbus
and
of
the
fair
white
city
but
i
can
not
imagine
what
discoveries
i
have
made
i
mean
new
discoveries
we
are
all
discoverers
in
one
sense
being
born
quite
ignorant
of
all
things
but
i
hardly
think
that
is
what
she
meant
tell
her
she
must
explain
why
i
am
a
discoverer
to
edward
everett
hale
hulton
pennsylvania
january
my
dear
cousin
i
had
thought
to
write
to
you
long
before
this
in
answer
to
your
kind
letter
which
i
was
so
glad
to
receive
and
to
thank
you
for
the
beautiful
little
book
which
you
sent
me
but
i
have
been
very
busy
since
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
the
publication
of
my
little
story
in
the
youth
companion
has
brought
me
a
large
number
of
letters
last
week
i
received
and
besides
replying
to
some
of
these
letters
i
have
many
lessons
to
learn
among
them
arithmetic
and
latin
and
you
know
caesar
is
caesar
still
imperious
and
tyrannical
and
if
a
little
girl
would
understand
so
great
a
man
and
the
wars
and
conquests
of
which
he
tells
in
his
beautiful
latin
language
she
must
study
much
and
think
much
and
study
and
thought
require
time
i
shall
prize
the
little
book
always
not
only
for
its
own
value
but
because
of
its
associations
with
you
it
is
a
delight
to
think
of
you
as
the
giver
of
one
of
your
books
into
which
i
am
sure
you
have
wrought
your
own
thoughts
and
feelings
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
remembering
me
in
such
a
very
beautiful
way
in
february
helen
and
miss
sullivan
returned
to
tuscumbia
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
spring
reading
and
studying
in
the
summer
they
attended
the
meeting
at
chautauqua
of
the
american
association
for
the
promotion
of
the
teaching
of
speech
to
the
deaf
where
miss
sullivan
read
a
paper
on
helen
education
in
the
fall
helen
and
miss
sullivan
entered
the
school
in
new
york
which
makes
a
special
of
and
the
singing
lessons
were
to
strengthen
her
voice
she
had
taken
a
few
piano
lessons
at
the
perkins
institution
the
experiment
was
interesting
but
of
course
came
to
little
to
miss
caroline
derby
the
school
west
new
york
the
school
is
very
pleasant
and
bless
you
it
is
quite
fashionable
i
study
arithmetic
english
literature
and
united
states
history
as
i
did
last
winter
i
also
keep
a
diary
i
enjoy
my
singing
lessons
with
humason
more
than
i
can
say
i
expect
to
take
piano
lessons
sometime
last
saturday
our
kind
teachers
planned
a
delightful
trip
to
bedloe
island
to
see
bartholdi
great
statue
of
liberty
enlightening
the
world
the
ancient
cannon
which
look
seaward
wear
a
very
menacing
expression
but
i
doubt
if
there
is
any
unkindness
in
their
rusty
old
hearts
liberty
is
a
gigantic
figure
of
a
woman
in
greek
draperies
holding
in
her
right
hand
a
torch
a
spiral
stairway
leads
from
the
base
of
this
pedestal
to
the
torch
we
climbed
up
to
the
head
which
will
hold
forty
persons
and
viewed
the
scene
on
which
liberty
gazes
day
and
night
and
o
how
wonderful
it
was
we
did
not
wonder
that
the
great
french
artist
thought
the
place
worthy
to
be
the
home
of
his
grand
ideal
the
glorious
bay
lay
calm
and
beautiful
in
the
october
sunshine
and
the
ships
came
and
went
like
idle
dreams
those
seaward
going
slowly
disappeared
like
clouds
that
change
from
gold
to
gray
those
homeward
coming
sped
more
quickly
like
birds
that
seek
their
mother
nest
to
miss
caroline
derby
the
school
new
york
march
i
think
i
have
improved
a
little
in
though
i
still
find
it
very
difficult
to
read
rapid
speech
but
i
am
sure
i
shall
succeed
some
day
if
i
only
persevere
humason
is
still
trying
to
improve
my
speech
oh
carrie
how
i
should
like
to
speak
like
other
people
i
should
be
willing
to
work
night
and
day
if
it
could
only
be
accomplished
think
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
all
of
my
friends
to
hear
me
speak
naturally
i
wonder
why
it
is
so
difficult
and
perplexing
for
a
deaf
child
to
learn
to
speak
when
it
is
so
easy
for
other
people
but
i
am
sure
i
shall
speak
perfectly
some
time
if
i
am
only
patient
although
i
have
been
so
busy
i
have
found
time
to
read
a
good
deal
i
have
lately
read
wilhelm
tell
by
schiller
and
the
lost
now
i
am
reading
nathan
the
wise
by
lessing
and
king
arthur
by
miss
mulock
you
know
our
kind
teachers
take
us
to
see
everything
which
they
think
will
interest
us
and
we
learn
a
great
deal
in
that
delightful
way
on
george
washington
birthday
we
all
went
to
the
dog
show
and
although
there
was
a
great
crowd
in
the
madison
square
garden
and
despite
the
bewilderment
caused
by
the
variety
of
sounds
made
by
the
which
was
very
confusing
to
those
who
could
hear
them
we
enjoyed
the
afternoon
very
much
among
the
dogs
which
received
the
most
attention
were
the
bulldogs
they
permitted
themselves
startling
liberties
when
any
one
caressed
them
crowding
themselves
almost
into
one
arms
and
helping
themselves
without
ceremony
to
kisses
apparently
unconscious
of
the
impropriety
of
their
conduct
dear
me
what
unbeautiful
little
beasts
they
are
but
they
are
so
good
natured
and
friendly
one
can
not
help
liking
them
humason
teacher
and
i
left
the
others
at
the
dog
show
and
went
to
a
reception
given
by
the
metropolitan
it
is
sometimes
called
the
millionaires
club
the
building
is
magnificent
being
built
of
white
marble
the
rooms
are
large
and
splendidly
furnished
but
i
must
confess
so
much
splendor
is
rather
oppressive
to
me
and
i
did
envy
the
millionaires
in
the
least
all
the
happiness
their
gorgeous
surroundings
are
supposed
to
bring
them
to
kate
adams
keller
new
york
march
teacher
and
i
spent
the
afternoon
at
hutton
and
had
a
most
delightful
time
we
met
clemens
and
howells
there
i
had
known
about
them
for
a
long
time
but
i
had
never
thought
that
i
should
see
them
and
talk
to
them
and
i
can
scarcely
realize
now
that
this
great
pleasure
has
been
mine
but
much
as
i
wonder
that
i
only
a
little
girl
of
fourteen
should
come
in
contact
with
so
many
distinguished
people
i
do
realize
that
i
am
a
very
happy
child
and
very
grateful
for
the
many
beautiful
privileges
i
have
enjoyed
the
two
distinguished
authors
were
very
gentle
and
kind
and
i
could
not
tell
which
of
them
i
loved
best
clemens
told
us
many
entertaining
stories
and
made
us
laugh
till
we
cried
i
only
wish
you
could
have
seen
and
heard
him
he
told
us
that
he
would
go
to
europe
in
a
few
days
to
bring
his
wife
and
his
daughter
jeanne
back
to
america
because
jeanne
who
is
studying
in
paris
has
learned
so
much
in
three
years
and
a
half
that
if
he
did
not
bring
her
home
she
would
soon
know
more
than
he
did
i
think
mark
twain
is
a
very
appropriate
nom
de
plume
for
clemens
because
it
has
a
funny
and
quaint
sound
and
goes
well
with
his
amusing
writings
and
its
nautical
significance
suggests
the
deep
and
beautiful
things
that
he
has
written
i
think
he
is
very
handsome
indeed
teacher
said
she
thought
he
looked
something
like
paradeuski
if
that
is
the
way
to
spell
the
name
howells
told
me
a
little
about
venice
which
is
one
of
his
favorite
cities
and
spoke
very
tenderly
of

pleasure

time
hutton
gave
me
a
lovely
little
glass
shaped
like
a
thistle
which
belonged
to
his
dear
mother
as
a
souvenir
of
my
delightful
visit
we
also
met
rogers
who
kindly
left
his
carriage
to
bring
us
home
when
the
school
closed
for
the
summer
miss
sullivan
and
helen
went
south
to
laurence
hutton
tuscumbia
alabama
july
i
am
spending
my
vacation
very
quietly
and
pleasantly
at
my
beautiful
sunny
home
with
my
loving
parents
my
darling
little
sister
and
my
small
brother
phillips
my
precious
teacher
is
with
me
too
and
so
of
course
i
am
happy
i
read
a
little
walk
a
little
write
a
little
and
play
with
the
children
a
great
deal
and
the
days
slip
by
delightfully
my
friends
are
so
pleased
with
the
improvement
which
i
made
in
speech
and
last
year
that
it
has
been
decided
best
for
me
to
continue
my
studies
in
new
york
another
year
i
am
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
spending
another
year
in
your
great
city
i
used
to
think
that
i
should
never
feel
at
home
in
new
york
but
since
i
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
so
many
people
and
can
look
back
to
such
a
bright
and
successful
winter
there
i
find
myself
looking
forward
to
next
year
and
anticipating
still
brighter
and
better
times
in
the
metropolis
please
give
my
kindest
love
to
mr
hutton
and
mrs
riggs
and
mr
warner
too
although
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
him
personally
as
i
listen
venicewards
i
hear
mr
hutton
pen
dancing
over
the
pages
of
his
new
book
it
is
a
pleasant
sound
because
it
is
full
of
promise
how
much
i
shall
enjoy
reading
it
please
pardon
me
my
dear
mrs
hutton
for
sending
you
a
typewritten
letter
across
the
ocean
i
have
tried
several
times
to
write
with
a
pencil
on
my
little
writing
machine
since
i
came
home
but
i
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
do
so
on
account
of
the
heat
the
moisture
of
my
hand
soils
and
blurs
the
paper
so
dreadfully
that
i
am
compelled
to
use
my
typewriter
altogether
and
it
is
not
my
remington
either
but
a
naughty
little
thing
that
gets
out
of
order
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
can
not
be
induced
to
make
a
period
to
william
thaw
new
york
october
here
we
are
once
more
in
the
great
metropolis
we
left
hulton
friday
night
and
arrived
here
saturday
morning
our
friends
were
greatly
surprised
to
see
us
as
they
had
not
expected
us
before
the
last
of
this
month
i
rested
saturday
afternoon
for
i
was
very
tired
and
sunday
i
visited
with
my
schoolmates
and
now
that
i
feel
quite
rested
i
am
going
to
write
to
you
for
i
know
you
will
want
to
hear
that
we
reached
new
york
safely
we
had
to
change
cars
at
philadelphia
but
we
did
not
mind
it
much
after
we
had
had
our
breakfast
teacher
asked
one
of
the
in
the
station
if
the
new
york
train
was
made
up
he
said
no
it
would
not
be
called
for
about
fifteen
minutes
so
we
sat
down
to
wait
but
in
a
moment
the
man
came
back
and
asked
teacher
if
we
would
like
to
go
to
the
train
at
once
she
said
we
would
and
he
took
us
way
out
on
the
track
and
put
us
on
board
our
train
thus
we
avoided
the
rush
and
had
a
nice
quiet
visit
before
the
train
started
was
that
not
very
kind
so
it
always
is
some
one
is
ever
ready
to
scatter
little
acts
of
kindness
along
our
pathway
making
it
smooth
and
pleasant
we
had
a
quiet
but
very
pleasant
time
in
hulton
wade
is
just
as
dear
and
good
as
ever
he
has
lately
had
several
books
printed
in
england
for
me
old
mortality
the
castle
of
otranto
and
king
of
to
miss
caroline
derby
new
york
december
teacher
and
i
have
been
very
gay
of
late
we
have
seen
our
kind
friends
mrs
dodge
and
hutton
riggs
and
her
husband
and
met
many
distinguished
people
among
whom
were
miss
ellen
terry
sir
henry
irving
and
stockton
were
we
very
fortunate
miss
terry
was
lovely
she
kissed
teacher
and
said
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
glad
to
see
you
or
not
for
i
feel
so
ashamed
of
myself
when
i
think
of
how
much
you
have
done
for
the
little
girl
we
also
met
and
terry
miss
brother
and
his
wife
i
thought
her
beauty
angellic
and
oh
what
a
clear
beautiful
voice
she
had
we
saw
miss
terry
again
with
sir
henry
in
king
charles
the
first
a
week
ago
last
friday
and
after
the
play
they
kindly
let
me
feel
of
them
and
get
an
idea
of
how
they
looked
how
noble
and
kingly
the
king
was
especially
in
his
misfortunes
and
how
pretty
and
faithful
the
poor
queen
was
the
play
seemed
so
real
we
almost
forgot
where
we
were
and
believed
we
were
watching
the
genuine
scenes
as
they
were
acted
so
long
ago
the
last
act
affected
us
most
deeply
and
we
all
wept
wondering
how
the
executioner
could
have
the
heart
to
tear
the
king
from
his
loving
wife
arms
i
have
just
finished
reading
ivanhoe
it
was
very
exciting
but
i
must
say
i
did
not
enjoy
it
very
much
sweet
rebecca
with
her
strong
brave
spirit
and
her
pure
generous
nature
was
the
only
character
which
thoroughly
won
my
admiration
now
i
am
reading
stories
from
scottish
history
and
they
are
very
thrilling
and
absorbing
the
next
two
letters
were
written
just
after
the
death
of
john
spaulding
to
george
bradford
new
york
february
what
can
i
say
which
will
make
you
understand
how
much
teacher
and
i
appreciate
your
thoughtful
kindness
in
sending
us
those
little
souvenirs
of
the
dear
room
where
we
first
met
the
best
and
kindest
of
friends
indeed
you
can
never
know
all
the
comfort
you
have
given
us
we
have
put
the
dear
picture
on
the
in
our
room
where
we
can
see
it
every
day
and
i
often
go
and
touch
it
and
somehow
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
our
beloved
friend
is
very
near
to
me
it
was
very
hard
to
take
up
our
school
work
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
i
am
sure
it
is
well
that
we
have
duties
which
must
be
done
and
which
take
our
minds
away
for
a
time
at
least
from
our
sorrow
to
miss
caroline
derby
new
york
march
we
miss
dear
king
john
sadly
it
was
so
hard
to
lose
him
he
was
the
best
and
kindest
of
friends
and
i
do
not
know
what
we
shall
do
without
him
we
went
to
a
and
the
man
there
kindly
permitted
us
to
feel
of
the
birds
they
were
so
tame
they
stood
perfectly
still
when
i
handled
them
i
saw
great
big
turkeys
geese
guineas
ducks
and
many
others
almost
two
weeks
ago
we
called
at
hutton
and
had
a
delightful
time
we
always
do
we
met
warner
the
writer
mabie
the
editor
of
the
outlook
and
other
pleasant
people
i
am
sure
you
would
like
to
know
and
hutton
they
are
so
kind
and
interesting
i
can
never
tell
you
how
much
pleasure
they
have
given
us
warner
and
burroughs
the
great
lover
of
nature
came
to
see
us
a
few
days
after
and
we
had
a
delightful
talk
with
them
they
were
both
very
very
dear
burroughs
told
me
about
his
home
near
the
hudson
and
what
a
happy
place
it
must
be
i
hope
we
shall
visit
it
some
day
teacher
has
read
me
his
lively
stories
about
his
boyhood
and
i
enjoyed
them
greatly
have
you
read
the
beautiful
poem
waiting
i
know
it
and
it
makes
me
feel
so
happy
it
has
such
sweet
thoughts
warner
showed
me
a
with
a
beetle
on
it
which
was
made
in
egypt
fifteen
hundred
years
before
christ
and
told
me
that
the
beetle
meant
immortality
to
the
egyptians
because
it
wrapped
itself
up
and
went
to
sleep
and
came
out
again
in
a
new
form
thus
renewing
itself
to
miss
caroline
derby
new
york
april
my
studies
are
the
same
as
they
were
when
i
saw
you
except
that
i
have
taken
up
french
with
a
french
teacher
who
comes
three
times
a
week
i
read
her
lips
almost
exclusively
she
does
not
know
the
manual
alphabet
and
we
get
on
quite
well
i
have
read
le
medecin
malgre
lui
a
very
good
french
comedy
by
moliere
with
pleasure
and
they
say
i
speak
french
pretty
well
now
and
german
also
anyway
french
and
german
people
understand
what
i
am
trying
to
say
and
that
is
very
encouraging
in
i
have
still
the
same
old
difficulties
to
contend
against
and
the
fulfilment
of
my
wish
to
speak
well
seems
o
so
far
away
sometimes
i
feel
sure
that
i
catch
a
faint
glimpse
of
the
goal
i
am
striving
for
but
in
another
minute
a
bend
in
the
road
hides
it
from
my
view
and
i
am
again
left
wandering
in
the
dark
but
i
try
hard
not
to
be
discouraged
surely
we
shall
all
find
at
last
the
ideals
we
are
seeking
to
john
hitz
brewster
mass
july
as
to
the
book
i
am
sure
i
shall
enjoy
it
very
much
when
i
am
admitted
by
the
magic
of
teacher
dear
fingers
into
the
companionship
of
the
two
sisters
who
went
to
the
immortal
fountain
as
i
sit
by
the
window
writing
to
you
it
is
so
lovely
to
have
the
soft
cool
breezes
fan
my
cheek
and
to
feel
that
the
hard
work
of
last
year
is
over
teacher
seems
to
feel
benefitted
by
the
change
too
for
she
is
already
beginning
to
look
like
her
dear
old
self
we
only
need
you
dear
hitz
to
complete
our
happiness
teacher
and
hopkins
both
say
you
must
come
as
soon
as
you
can
we
will
try
to
make
you
comfortable
teacher
and
i
spent
nine
days
at
philadelphia
have
you
ever
been
at
crouter
institution
howes
has
probably
given
you
a
full
account
of
our
doings
we
were
busy
all
the
time
we
attended
the
meetings
and
talked
with
hundreds
of
people
among
whom
were
dear
bell
banerji
of
calcutta
monsieur
magnat
of
paris
with
whom
i
conversed
in
french
exclusively
and
many
other
distinguished
persons
we
had
looked
forward
to
seeing
you
there
and
so
we
were
greatly
disappointed
that
you
did
not
come
we
think
of
you
so
so
often
and
our
hearts
go
out
to
you
in
tenderest
sympathy
and
you
know
better
than
this
poor
letter
can
tell
you
how
happy
we
always
are
to
have
you
with
us
i
made
a
speech
on
july
eighth
telling
the
members
of
the
association
what
an
unspeakable
blessing
speech
has
been
to
me
and
urging
them
to
give
every
little
deaf
child
an
opportunity
to
learn
to
speak
every
one
said
i
spoke
very
well
and
intelligibly
after
my
little
speech
we
attended
a
reception
at
which
over
six
hundred
people
were
present
i
must
confess
i
do
not
like
such
large
receptions
the
people
crowd
so
and
we
have
to
do
so
much
talking
and
yet
it
is
at
receptions
like
the
one
in
philadelphia
that
we
often
meet
friends
whom
we
learn
to
love
afterwards
we
left
the
city
last
thursday
night
and
arrived
in
brewster
friday
afternoon
we
missed
the
cape
cod
train
friday
morning
and
so
we
came
down
to
provincetown
in
the
steamer
longfellow
i
am
glad
we
did
so
for
it
was
lovely
and
cool
on
the
water
and
boston
harbor
is
always
interesting
we
spent
about
three
weeks
in
boston
after
leaving
new
york
and
i
need
not
tell
you
we
had
a
most
delightful
time
we
visited
our
good
friends
and
chamberlin
at
wrentham
out
in
the
country
where
they
have
a
lovely
home
their
house
stands
near
a
charming
lake
where
we
went
boating
and
canoeing
which
was
great
fun
we
also
went
in
bathing
several
times
and
chamberlin
celebrated
the
of
june
by
giving
a
picnic
to
their
literary
friends
there
were
about
forty
persons
present
all
of
whom
were
writers
and
publishers
our
friend
alden
the
editor
of
harper
was
there
and
of
course
we
enjoyed
his
society
very
much
to
charles
dudley
warner
brewster
september
i
have
been
meaning
to
write
to
you
all
summer
there
were
many
things
i
wanted
to
tell
you
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
like
to
hear
about
our
vacation
by
the
seaside
and
our
plans
for
next
year
but
the
happy
idle
days
slipped
away
so
quickly
and
there
were
so
many
pleasant
things
to
do
every
moment
that
i
never
found
time
to
clothe
my
thought
in
words
and
send
them
to
you
i
wonder
what
becomes
of
lost
opportunities
perhaps
our
guardian
angel
gathers
them
up
as
we
drop
them
and
will
give
them
back
to
us
in
the
beautiful
sometime
when
we
have
grown
wiser
and
learned
how
to
use
them
rightly
but
however
this
may
be
i
can
not
now
write
the
letter
which
has
lain
in
my
thought
for
you
so
long
my
heart
is
too
full
of
sadness
to
dwell
upon
the
happiness
the
summer
has
brought
me
my
father
is
dead
he
died
last
saturday
at
my
home
in
tuscumbia
and
i
was
not
there
my
own
dear
loving
father
oh
dear
friend
how
shall
i
ever
bear
it
on
the
first
of
october
miss
keller
entered
the
cambridge
school
for
young
ladies
of
which
arthur
gilman
is
principal
the
examinations
mentioned
in
this
letter
were
merely
tests
given
in
the
school
but
as
they
were
old
harvard
papers
it
is
evident
that
in
some
subjects
miss
keller
was
already
fairly
well
prepared
for
radcliffe
to
laurence
hutton
concord
avenue
cambridge
mass
october
i
got
up
early
this
morning
so
that
i
could
write
you
a
few
lines
i
know
you
want
to
hear
how
i
like
my
school
i
do
wish
you
could
come
and
see
for
yourself
what
a
beautiful
school
it
is
there
are
about
a
hundred
girls
and
they
are
all
so
bright
and
happy
it
is
a
joy
to
be
with
them
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
passed
my
examinations
successfully
i
have
been
examined
in
english
german
french
and
greek
and
roman
history
they
were
the
entrance
examinations
for
harvard
college
so
i
feel
pleased
to
think
i
could
pass
them
this
year
is
going
to
be
a
very
busy
one
for
teacher
and
myself
i
am
studying
arithmetic
english
literature
english
history
german
latin
and
advanced
geography
there
is
a
great
deal
of
preparatory
reading
required
and
as
few
of
the
books
are
in
raised
print
poor
teacher
has
to
spell
them
all
out
to
me
and
that
means
hard
work
you
must
tell
howells
when
you
see
him
that
we
are
living
in
his
house
to
william
thaw
concord
avenue
cambridge
december
it
takes
me
a
long
time
to
prepare
my
lessons
because
i
have
to
have
every
word
of
them
spelled
out
in
my
hand
not
one
of
the
textbooks
which
i
am
obliged
to
use
is
in
raised
print
so
of
course
my
work
is
harder
than
it
would
be
if
i
could
read
my
lessons
over
by
myself
but
it
is
harder
for
teacher
than
it
is
for
me
because
the
strain
on
her
poor
eyes
is
so
great
and
i
can
not
help
worrying
about
them
sometimes
it
really
seems
as
if
the
task
which
we
have
set
ourselves
were
more
than
we
can
accomplish
but
at
other
times
i
enjoy
my
work
more
than
i
can
say
it
is
such
a
delight
to
be
with
the
other
girls
and
do
everything
that
they
do
i
study
latin
german
arithmetic
and
english
history
all
of
which
i
enjoy
except
arithmetic
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
a
mathematical
mind
for
my
figures
always
manage
to
get
into
the
wrong
places
to
laurence
hutton
cambridge
may
you
know
i
am
trying
very
hard
to
get
through
with
the
reading
for
the
examinations
in
june
and
this
in
addition
to
my
regular
schoolwork
keeps
me
awfully
busy
but
johnson
and
the
plague
and
everything
else
must
wait
a
few
minutes
this
afternoon
while
i
say
thank
you
my
dear
hutton
what
a
splendid
time
we
had
at
the
players
club
i
always
thought
clubs
were
dull
smoky
places
where
men
talked
politics
and
told
endless
stories
all
about
themselves
and
their
wonderful
exploits
but
now
i
see
i
must
have
been
quite
wrong
to
john
hitz
wrentham
mass
july
teacher
and
i
are
going
to
spend
the
summer
at
wrentham
mass
with
our
friends
the
chamberlins
i
think
you
remember
chamberlin
the
listener
in
the
boston
transcript
they
are
dear
kind
people
but
i
know
you
want
to
hear
about
my
examinations
i
know
that
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
passed
all
of
them
successfully
the
subjects
i
offered
were
elementary
and
advanced
german
french
latin
english
and
greek
and
roman
history
it
seems
almost
too
good
to
be
true
does
it
not
all
the
time
i
was
preparing
for
the
great
ordeal
i
could
not
suppress
an
inward
fear
and
trembling
lest
i
should
fail
and
now
it
is
an
unspeakable
relief
to
know
that
i
have
passed
the
examinations
with
credit
but
what
i
consider
my
crown
of
success
is
the
happiness
and
pleasure
that
my
victory
has
brought
dear
teacher
indeed
i
feel
that
the
success
is
hers
more
than
mine
for
she
is
my
constant
inspiration
at
the
end
of
september
miss
sullivan
and
miss
keller
returned
to
the
cambridge
school
where
they
remained
until
early
in
december
then
the
interference
of
gilman
resulted
in
keller
withdrawing
miss
helen
and
her
sister
miss
mildred
from
the
school
miss
sullivan
and
her
pupil
went
to
wrentham
where
they
worked
under
merton
keith
an
enthusiastic
and
skilful
teacher
to
laurence
hutton
wrentham
february
i
resumed
my
studies
soon
after
your
departure
and
in
a
very
little
while
we
were
working
as
merrily
as
if
the
dreadful
experience
of
a
month
ago
had
been
but
a
dream
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
enjoy
the
country
it
is
so
fresh
and
peaceful
and
free
i
do
think
i
could
work
all
day
long
without
feeling
tired
if
they
would
let
me
there
are
so
many
pleasant
things
to
do
not
always
very
easy
things
much
of
my
work
in
algebra
and
geometry
is
hard
but
i
love
it
all
especially
greek
just
think
i
shall
soon
finish
my
grammar
then
comes
the
iliad
what
an
inexpressible
joy
it
will
be
to
read
about
achilles
and
ulysses
and
andromache
and
athene
and
the
rest
of
my
old
friends
in
their
own
glorious
language
i
think
greek
is
the
loveliest
language
that
i
know
anything
about
if
it
is
true
that
the
violin
is
the
most
perfect
of
musical
instruments
then
greek
is
the
violin
of
human
thought
we
have
had
some
splendid
toboganning
this
month
every
morning
before
we
all
go
out
to
the
steep
hill
on
the
northern
shore
of
the
lake
near
the
house
and
coast
for
an
hour
or
so
some
one
balances
the
toboggan
on
the
very
crest
of
the
hill
while
we
get
on
and
when
we
are
ready
off
we
dash
down
the
side
of
the
hill
in
a
headlong
rush
and
leaping
a
projection
plunge
into
a
and
go
swimming
far
across
the
pond
at
a
tremendous
rate
to
laurence
hutton
wrentham
april
i
am
glad
keith
is
so
well
pleased
with
my
progress
it
is
true
that
algebra
and
geometry
are
growing
easier
all
the
time
especially
algebra
and
i
have
just
received
books
in
raised
print
which
will
greatly
facilitate
my
work
i
find
i
get
on
faster
and
do
better
work
with
keith
than
i
did
in
the
classes
at
the
cambridge
school
and
i
think
it
was
well
that
i
gave
up
that
kind
of
work
at
any
rate
i
have
not
been
idle
since
i
left
school
i
have
accomplished
more
and
been
happier
than
i
could
have
been
there
to
laurence
hutton
wrentham
may
my
work
goes
on
bravely
each
day
is
filled
to
the
brim
with
hard
study
for
i
am
anxious
to
accomplish
as
much
as
possible
before
i
put
away
my
books
for
the
summer
vacation
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
did
three
problems
in
geometry
yesterday
without
assistance
keith
and
teacher
were
quite
enthusiastic
over
the
achievement
and
i
must
confess
i
felt
somewhat
elated
myself
now
i
feel
as
if
i
should
succeed
in
doing
something
in
mathematics
although
i
can
not
see
why
it
is
so
very
important
to
know
that
the
lines
drawn
from
the
extremities
of
the
base
of
an
isosceles
triangle
to
the
middle
points
of
the
opposite
sides
are
equal
the
knowledge
does
make
life
any
sweeter
or
happier
does
it
on
the
other
hand
when
we
learn
a
new
word
it
is
the
key
to
untold
treasures
to
charles
dudley
warner
wrentham
june
i
am
afraid
you
will
conclude
that
i
am
not
very
anxious
for
a
tandem
after
all
since
i
have
let
nearly
a
week
pass
without
answering
your
letter
in
regard
to
the
kind
of
wheel
i
should
like
but
really
i
have
been
so
constantly
occupied
with
my
studies
since
we
returned
from
new
york
that
i
have
not
had
time
even
to
think
of
the
fun
it
would
be
to
have
a
bicycle
you
see
i
am
anxious
to
accomplish
as
much
as
possible
before
the
long
summer
vacation
begins
i
am
glad
though
that
it
is
nearly
time
to
put
away
my
books
for
the
sunshine
and
flowers
and
the
lovely
lake
in
front
of
our
house
are
doing
their
best
to
tempt
me
away
from
my
greek
and
mathematics
especially
from
the
latter
i
am
sure
the
daisies
and
buttercups
have
as
little
use
for
the
science
of
geometry
as
i
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
so
beautifully
illustrate
its
principles
but
bless
me
i
must
forget
the
tandem
the
truth
is
i
know
very
little
about
bicycles
i
have
only
ridden
a
sociable
which
is
very
different
from
the
ordinary
tandem
the
sociable
is
safer
perhaps
than
the
tandem
but
it
is
very
heavy
and
awkward
and
has
a
way
of
taking
up
the
greater
part
of
the
road
besides
i
have
been
told
that
sociables
cost
more
than
other
kinds
of
bicycles
my
teacher
and
other
friends
think
i
could
ride
a
columbia
tandem
in
the
country
with
perfect
safety
they
also
think
your
suggestion
about
a
fixed
handlebar
a
good
one
i
ride
with
a
divided
skirt
and
so
does
my
teacher
but
it
would
be
easier
for
her
to
mount
a
man
wheel
than
for
me
so
if
it
could
be
arranged
to
have
the
ladies
seat
behind
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
miss
caroline
derby
wrentham
september
i
am
out
of
doors
all
the
time
rowing
swimming
riding
and
doing
a
multitude
of
other
pleasant
things
this
morning
i
rode
over
twelve
miles
on
my
tandem
i
rode
on
a
rough
road
and
fell
off
three
or
four
times
and
am
now
awfully
lame
but
the
weather
and
the
scenery
were
so
beautiful
and
it
was
such
fun
to
go
scooting
over
the
smoother
part
of
the
road
i
did
mind
the
mishaps
in
the
least
i
have
really
learned
to
swim
and
dive
after
a
fashion
i
can
swim
a
little
under
water
and
do
almost
anything
i
like
without
fear
of
getting
drowned
is
that
fine
it
is
almost
no
effort
for
me
to
row
around
the
lake
no
matter
how
heavy
the
load
may
be
so
you
can
well
imagine
how
strong
and
brown
i
am
to
laurence
hutton
newbury
street
boston
october
this
is
the
first
opportunity
i
have
had
to
write
to
you
since
we
came
here
last
monday
we
have
been
in
such
a
whirl
ever
since
we
decided
to
come
to
boston
it
seemed
as
if
we
should
never
get
settled
poor
teacher
has
had
her
hands
full
attending
to
movers
and
and
all
sorts
of
people
i
wish
it
were
not
such
a
bother
to
move
especially
as
we
have
to
do
it
so
often
keith
comes
here
at
half
past
three
every
day
except
saturday
he
says
he
prefers
to
come
here
for
the
present
i
am
reading
the
iliad
and
the
aeneid
and
cicero
besides
doing
a
lot
in
geometry
and
algebra
the
iliad
is
beautiful
with
all
the
truth
and
grace
and
simplicity
of
a
wonderfully
childlike
people
while
the
aeneid
is
more
stately
and
reserved
it
is
like
a
beautiful
maiden
who
always
lived
in
a
palace
surrounded
by
a
magnificent
court
while
the
iliad
is
like
a
splendid
youth
who
has
had
the
earth
for
his
playground
the
weather
has
been
awfully
dismal
all
the
week
but
is
beautiful
and
our
room
floor
is
flooded
with
sunlight
by
and
by
we
shall
take
a
little
walk
in
the
public
gardens
i
wish
the
wrentham
woods
were
round
the
corner
but
alas
they
are
not
and
i
shall
have
to
content
myself
with
a
stroll
in
the
gardens
somehow
after
the
great
fields
and
pastures
and
lofty
of
the
country
they
seem
and
conventional
even
the
trees
seem
citified
and
indeed
i
doubt
if
they
are
on
speaking
terms
with
their
country
cousins
do
you
know
i
can
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
these
trees
with
all
their
fashionable
airs
they
are
like
the
people
whom
they
see
every
day
who
prefer
the
crowded
noisy
city
to
the
quiet
and
freedom
of
the
country
they
do
not
even
suspect
how
circumscribed
their
lives
are
they
look
down
pityingly
on
the
who
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
see
the
great
world
oh
my
if
they
only
realized
their
limitations
they
would
flee
for
their
lives
to
the
woods
and
fields
but
what
nonsense
is
this
you
will
think
i
pining
away
for
my
beloved
wrentham
which
is
true
in
one
sense
and
not
in
another
i
do
miss
red
farm
and
the
dear
ones
there
dreadfully
but
i
am
not
unhappy
i
have
teacher
and
my
books
and
i
have
the
certainty
that
something
sweet
and
good
will
come
to
me
in
this
great
city
where
human
beings
struggle
so
bravely
all
their
lives
to
wring
happiness
from
cruel
circumstances
anyway
i
am
glad
to
have
my
share
in
life
whether
it
be
bright
or
sad
to
william
thaw
boston
december
my
teacher
and
i
had
a
good
laugh
over
the
girls
frolic
how
funny
they
must
have
looked
in
their
costumes
mounted
upon
their
fiery
steeds
slim
would
describe
them
if
they
were
anything
like
the
i
have
seen
what
jolly
times
they
must
have
at
i
can
not
help
wishing
sometimes
that
i
could
have
some
of
the
fun
that
other
girls
have
how
quickly
i
should
lock
up
all
these
mighty
warriors
and
hoary
sages
and
impossible
heroes
who
are
now
almost
my
only
companions
and
dance
and
sing
and
frolic
like
other
girls
but
i
must
not
waste
my
time
wishing
idle
wishes
and
after
all
my
ancient
friends
are
very
wise
and
interesting
and
i
usually
enjoy
their
society
very
much
indeed
it
is
only
once
in
a
great
while
that
i
feel
discontented
and
allow
myself
to
wish
for
things
i
can
not
hope
for
in
this
life
but
as
you
know
my
heart
is
usually
brimful
of
happiness
the
thought
that
my
dear
heavenly
father
is
always
near
giving
me
abundantly
of
all
those
things
which
truly
enrich
life
and
make
it
sweet
and
beautiful
makes
every
deprivation
seem
of
little
moment
compared
with
the
countless
blessings
i
enjoy
to
william
thaw
newbury
street
boston
december
i
realize
now
what
a
selfish
greedy
girl
i
was
to
ask
that
my
cup
of
happiness
should
be
filled
to
overflowing
without
stopping
to
think
how
many
other
people
cups
were
quite
empty
i
feel
heartily
ashamed
of
my
thoughtlessness
one
of
the
childish
illusions
which
it
has
been
hardest
for
me
to
get
rid
of
is
that
we
have
only
to
make
our
wishes
known
in
order
to
have
them
granted
but
i
am
slowly
learning
that
there
is
not
happiness
enough
in
the
world
for
everyone
to
have
all
that
he
wants
and
it
grieves
me
to
think
that
i
should
have
forgotten
even
for
a
moment
that
i
already
have
more
than
my
share
and
that
like
poor
little
oliver
twist
i
should
have
asked
for
to
laurence
hutton
newberry
street
boston
december
i
suppose
keith
writes
you
the
news
if
so
you
know
that
i
have
finished
all
the
geometry
and
nearly
all
the
algebra
required
for
the
harvard
examinations
and
after
christmas
i
shall
begin
a
very
careful
review
of
both
subjects
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
enjoy
mathematics
now
why
i
can
do
long
complicated
quadratic
equations
in
my
head
quite
easily
and
it
is
great
fun
i
think
keith
is
a
wonderful
teacher
and
i
feel
very
grateful
to
him
for
having
made
me
see
the
beauty
of
mathematics
next
to
my
own
dear
teacher
he
has
done
more
than
any
one
else
to
enrich
and
broaden
my
mind
to
laurence
hutton
newbury
street
boston
january
have
you
seen
kipling
dreaming
true
or
school
it
is
a
very
strong
poem
and
set
me
dreaming
too
of
course
you
have
read
about
the
gordon
memorial
college
which
the
english
people
are
to
erect
at
khartoum
while
i
was
thinking
over
the
blessings
that
would
come
to
the
people
of
egypt
through
this
college
and
eventually
to
england
herself
there
came
into
my
heart
the
strong
desire
that
my
own
dear
country
should
in
a
similar
way
convert
the
terrible
loss
of
her
brave
sons
on
the
maine
into
a
like
blessing
to
the
people
of
cuba
would
a
college
at
havana
not
be
the
noblest
and
most
enduring
monument
that
could
be
raised
to
the
brave
men
of
the
maine
as
well
as
a
source
of
infinite
good
to
all
concerned
imagine
entering
the
havana
harbor
and
having
the
pier
where
the
maine
was
anchored
on
that
dreadful
night
when
she
was
so
mysteriously
destroyed
pointed
out
to
you
and
being
told
that
the
great
beautiful
building
overlooking
the
spot
was
the
maine
memorial
college
erected
by
the
american
people
and
having
for
its
object
the
education
both
of
cubans
and
spaniards
what
a
glorious
triumph
such
a
monument
would
be
of
the
best
and
highest
instincts
of
a
christian
nation
in
it
there
would
be
no
suggestion
of
hatred
or
revenge
nor
a
trace
of
the
belief
that
might
makes
right
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
a
pledge
to
the
world
that
we
intend
to
stand
by
our
declaration
of
war
and
give
cuba
to
the
cubans
as
soon
as
we
have
fitted
them
to
assume
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
a
people
to
john
hitz
newbury
street
boston
february
i
had
an
exceedingly
interesting
experience
last
monday
a
kind
friend
took
me
over
in
the
morning
to
the
boston
art
museum
she
had
previously
obtained
permission
from
general
loring
supt
of
the
museum
for
me
to
touch
the
statues
especially
those
which
represented
my
old
friends
in
the
iliad
and
aeneid
was
that
not
lovely
while
i
was
there
general
loring
himself
came
in
and
showed
me
some
of
the
most
beautiful
statues
among
which
were
the
venus
of
medici
the
minerva
of
the
parthenon
diana
in
her
hunting
costume
with
her
hand
on
the
quiver
and
a
doe
by
her
side
and
the
unfortunate
laocoon
and
his
two
little
sons
struggling
in
the
fearful
coils
of
two
huge
serpents
and
stretching
their
arms
to
the
skies
with
cries
i
also
saw
apollo
belvidere
he
had
just
slain
the
python
and
was
standing
by
a
great
pillar
of
rock
extending
his
graceful
hand
in
triumph
over
the
terrible
snake
oh
he
was
simply
beautiful
venus
entranced
me
she
looked
as
if
she
had
just
risen
from
the
foam
of
the
sea
and
her
loveliness
was
like
a
strain
of
heavenly
music
i
also
saw
poor
niobe
with
her
youngest
child
clinging
close
to
her
while
she
implored
the
cruel
goddess
not
to
kill
her
last
darling
i
almost
cried
it
was
all
so
real
and
tragic
general
loring
kindly
showed
me
a
copy
of
one
of
the
wonderful
bronze
doors
of
the
baptistry
of
florence
and
i
felt
of
the
graceful
pillars
resting
on
the
backs
of
fierce
lions
so
you
see
i
had
a
foretaste
of
the
pleasure
which
i
hope
some
day
to
have
of
visiting
florence
my
friend
said
she
would
sometime
show
me
the
copies
of
the
marbles
brought
away
by
lord
elgin
from
the
parthenon
but
somehow
i
should
prefer
to
see
the
originals
in
the
place
where
genius
meant
them
to
remain
not
only
as
a
hymn
of
praise
to
the
gods
but
also
as
a
monument
of
the
glory
of
greece
it
really
seems
wrong
to
snatch
such
sacred
things
away
from
the
sanctuary
of
the
past
where
they
belong
to
william
wade
boston
february
why
bless
you
i
thought
i
wrote
to
you
the
day
after
the
eclogues
arrived
and
told
you
how
glad
i
was
to
have
them
perhaps
you
never
got
that
letter
at
any
rate
i
thank
you
dear
friend
for
taking
such
a
world
of
trouble
for
me
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
the
books
from
england
are
coming
now
i
already
have
the
seventh
and
eighth
books
of
the
aeneid
and
one
book
of
the
iliad
all
of
which
is
most
fortunate
as
i
have
come
almost
to
the
end
of
my
embossed
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
hear
how
much
is
being
done
for
the
the
more
i
learn
of
them
the
more
kindness
i
find
why
only
a
little
while
ago
people
thought
it
quite
impossible
to
teach
the
anything
but
no
sooner
was
it
proved
possible
than
hundreds
of
kind
sympathetic
hearts
were
fired
with
the
desire
to
help
them
and
now
we
see
how
many
of
those
poor
unfortunate
persons
are
being
taught
to
see
the
beauty
and
reality
of
life
love
always
finds
its
way
to
an
imprisoned
soul
and
leads
it
out
into
the
world
of
freedom
and
intelligence
as
to
the
alphabet
i
think
it
is
much
easier
for
those
who
have
sight
than
the
manual
alphabet
for
most
of
the
letters
look
like
the
large
capitals
in
books
but
i
think
when
it
comes
to
teaching
a
person
to
spell
the
manual
alphabet
is
much
more
convenient
and
less
conspicuous
to
laurence
hutton
newbury
street
boston
march
i
am
now
sure
that
i
shall
be
ready
for
my
examinations
in
june
there
is
but
one
cloud
in
my
sky
at
present
but
that
is
one
which
casts
a
dark
shadow
over
my
life
and
makes
me
very
anxious
at
times
my
teacher
eyes
are
no
better
indeed
i
think
they
grow
more
troublesome
though
she
is
very
brave
and
patient
and
will
not
give
up
but
it
is
most
distressing
to
me
to
feel
that
she
is
sacrificing
her
sight
for
me
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
give
up
the
idea
of
going
to
college
altogether
for
not
all
the
knowledge
in
the
world
could
make
me
happy
if
obtained
at
such
a
cost
i
do
wish
hutton
you
would
try
to
persuade
teacher
to
take
a
rest
and
have
her
eyes
treated
she
will
not
listen
to
me
i
have
just
had
some
pictures
taken
and
if
they
are
good
i
would
like
to
send
one
to
rogers
if
you
think
he
would
like
to
have
it
i
would
like
so
much
to
show
him
in
some
way
how
deeply
i
appreciate
all
that
he
is
doing
for
me
and
i
can
not
think
of
anything
better
to
do
every
one
here
is
talking
about
the
sargent
pictures
it
is
a
wonderful
exhibition
of
portraits
they
say
how
i
wish
i
had
eyes
to
see
them
how
i
should
delight
in
their
beauty
and
color
however
i
am
glad
that
i
am
not
debarred
from
all
pleasure
in
the
pictures
i
have
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
through
the
eyes
of
my
friends
which
is
a
real
pleasure
i
am
so
thankful
that
i
can
rejoice
in
the
beauties
which
my
friends
gather
and
put
into
my
hands
we
are
all
so
glad
and
thankful
that
kipling
did
not
die
i
have
his
in
raised
print
and
what
a
splendid
refreshing
book
it
is
i
can
not
help
feeling
as
if
i
knew
its
gifted
author
what
a
real
manly
lovable
nature
his
must
be
to
david
greer
newbury
street
boston
may
each
day
brings
me
all
that
i
can
possibly
accomplish
and
each
night
brings
me
rest
and
the
sweet
thought
that
i
am
a
little
nearer
to
my
goal
than
ever
before
my
greek
progresses
finely
i
have
finished
the
ninth
book
of
the
iliad
and
am
just
beginning
the
odyssey
i
am
also
reading
the
aeneid
and
the
eclogues
some
of
my
friends
tell
me
that
i
am
very
foolish
to
give
so
much
time
to
greek
and
latin
but
i
am
sure
they
would
not
think
so
if
they
realized
what
a
wonderful
world
of
experience
and
thought
homer
and
virgil
have
opened
up
to
me
i
think
i
shall
enjoy
the
odyssey
most
of
all
the
iliad
tells
of
almost
nothing
but
war
and
one
sometimes
wearies
of
the
clash
of
spears
and
the
din
of
battle
but
the
odyssey
tells
of
nobler
courage
the
courage
of
a
soul
sore
tried
but
steadfast
to
the
end
i
often
wonder
as
i
read
these
splendid
poems
why
at
the
same
time
that
homer
songs
of
war
fired
the
greeks
with
valor
his
songs
of
manly
virtue
did
not
have
a
stronger
influence
upon
the
spiritual
life
of
the
people
perhaps
the
reason
is
that
thoughts
truly
great
are
like
seeds
cast
into
the
human
mind
and
either
lie
there
unnoticed
or
are
tossed
about
and
played
with
like
toys
until
grown
wise
through
suffering
and
experience
a
race
discovers
and
cultivates
them
then
the
world
has
advanced
one
step
in
its
heavenward
march
i
am
working
very
hard
just
now
i
intend
to
take
my
examinations
in
june
and
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
done
before
i
shall
feel
ready
to
meet
the
ordeal
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
my
mother
and
little
sister
and
brother
are
coming
north
to
spend
this
summer
with
me
we
shall
all
live
together
in
a
small
cottage
on
one
of
the
lakes
at
wrentham
while
my
dear
teacher
takes
a
much
needed
rest
she
has
not
had
a
vacation
for
twelve
years
think
of
it
and
all
that
time
she
has
been
the
sunshine
of
my
life
now
her
eyes
are
troubling
her
a
great
deal
and
we
all
think
she
ought
to
be
relieved
for
a
while
of
every
care
and
responsibility
but
we
shall
not
be
quite
separated
we
shall
see
each
other
every
day
i
hope
and
when
july
comes
you
can
think
of
me
as
rowing
my
dear
ones
around
the
lovely
lake
in
the
little
boat
you
gave
me
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
to
laurence
hutton
boston
may
we
have
had
a
hard
day
keith
was
here
for
three
hours
this
afternoon
pouring
a
torrent
of
latin
and
greek
into
my
poor
bewildered
brain
i
really
believe
he
knows
more
latin
and
greek
grammar
than
cicero
or
homer
ever
dreamed
of
cicero
is
splendid
but
his
orations
are
very
difficult
to
translate
i
feel
ashamed
sometimes
when
i
make
that
eloquent
man
say
what
sounds
absurd
or
insipid
but
how
is
a
to
interpret
such
genius
why
i
should
have
to
be
a
cicero
to
talk
like
a
cicero
linnie
haguewood
is
a
girl
one
of
the
many
whom
william
wade
has
helped
she
is
being
educated
by
miss
dora
donald
who
at
the
beginning
of
her
work
with
her
pupil
was
supplied
by
hitz
superintendent
of
the
volta
bureau
with
copies
of
all
documents
relating
to
miss
sullivan
work
with
miss
keller
to
william
wade
wrentham
june
linnie
haguewood
letter
which
you
sent
me
some
weeks
ago
interested
me
very
much
it
seemed
to
show
spontaneity
and
great
sweetness
of
character
i
was
a
good
deal
amused
by
what
she
said
about
history
i
am
sorry
she
does
not
enjoy
it
but
i
too
feel
sometimes
how
dark
and
mysterious
and
even
fearful
the
history
of
old
peoples
old
religions
and
old
forms
of
government
really
is
well
i
must
confess
i
do
not
like
the
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
of
much
use
to
the
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
follow
the
rapid
motions
made
by
the
and
besides
signs
seem
a
great
hindrance
to
them
in
acquiring
the
power
of
using
language
easily
and
freely
why
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
them
sometimes
when
they
spell
on
their
fingers
on
the
whole
if
they
can
not
be
taught
articulation
the
manual
alphabet
seems
the
best
and
most
convenient
means
of
communication
at
any
rate
i
am
sure
the
can
not
learn
to
use
signs
with
any
degree
of
facility
the
other
day
i
met
a
deaf
norwegian
gentleman
who
knows
ragnhild
kaata
and
her
teacher
very
well
and
we
had
a
very
interesting
conversation
about
her
he
said
she
was
very
industrious
and
happy
she
spins
and
does
a
great
deal
of
fancy
work
and
reads
and
leads
a
pleasant
useful
life
just
think
she
can
not
use
the
manual
alphabet
she
reads
the
lips
well
and
if
she
can
not
understand
a
phrase
her
friends
write
it
in
her
hand
and
in
this
way
she
converses
with
strangers
i
can
not
make
out
anything
written
in
my
hand
so
you
see
ragnhild
has
got
ahead
of
me
in
some
things
i
do
hope
i
shall
see
her
sometime
to
laurence
hutton
wrentham
july
i
passed
in
all
the
subjects
i
offered
and
with
credit
in
advanced
latin
but
i
must
confess
i
had
a
hard
time
on
the
second
day
of
my
examinations
they
would
not
allow
teacher
to
read
any
of
the
papers
to
me
so
the
papers
were
copied
for
me
in
braille
this
arrangement
worked
very
well
in
the
languages
but
not
nearly
so
well
in
the
mathematics
consequently
i
did
not
do
so
well
as
i
should
have
done
if
teacher
had
been
allowed
to
read
the
algebra
and
geometry
to
me
but
you
must
not
think
i
blame
any
one
of
course
they
did
not
realize
how
difficult
and
perplexing
they
were
making
the
examinations
for
me
how
could
they
they
can
see
and
hear
and
i
suppose
they
could
not
understand
matters
from
my
point
of
view
thus
far
my
summer
has
been
sweeter
than
anything
i
can
remember
my
mother
and
sister
and
little
brother
have
been
here
five
weeks
and
our
happiness
knows
no
bounds
not
only
do
we
enjoy
being
together
but
we
also
find
our
little
home
most
delightful
i
do
wish
you
could
see
the
view
of
the
beautiful
lake
from
our
piazza
the
islands
looking
like
little
emerald
peaks
in
the
golden
sunlight
and
the
canoes
flitting
here
and
there
like
autumn
leaves
in
the
gentle
breeze
and
breathe
in
the
peculiarly
delicious
fragrance
of
the
woods
which
comes
like
a
murmur
from
an
unknown
clime
i
can
not
help
wondering
if
it
is
the
same
fragrance
that
greeted
the
norsemen
long
ago
when
according
to
tradition
they
visited
our
shores
an
odorous
echo
of
many
centuries
of
silent
growth
and
decay
in
flower
and
tree
to
samuel
richard
fuller
wrentham
october
i
suppose
it
is
time
for
me
to
tell
you
something
about
our
plans
for
the
winter
you
know
it
has
long
been
my
ambition
to
go
to
radcliffe
and
receive
a
degree
as
many
other
girls
have
done
but
dean
irwin
of
radcliffe
has
persuaded
me
to
take
a
special
course
for
the
present
she
said
i
had
already
shown
the
world
that
i
could
do
the
college
work
by
passing
all
my
examinations
successfully
in
spite
of
many
obstacles
she
showed
me
how
very
foolish
it
would
be
for
me
to
pursue
a
four
course
of
study
at
radcliffe
simply
to
be
like
other
girls
when
i
might
better
be
cultivating
whatever
ability
i
had
for
writing
she
said
she
did
not
consider
a
degree
of
any
real
value
but
thought
it
was
much
more
desirable
to
do
something
original
than
to
waste
one
energies
only
for
a
degree
her
arguments
seemed
so
wise
and
practical
that
i
could
not
but
yield
i
found
it
hard
very
hard
to
give
up
the
idea
of
going
to
college
it
had
been
in
my
mind
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
but
there
is
no
use
doing
a
foolish
thing
because
one
has
wanted
to
do
it
a
long
time
is
there
but
while
we
were
discussing
plans
for
the
winter
a
suggestion
which
hale
had
made
long
ago
flashed
across
mind
that
i
might
take
courses
somewhat
like
those
offered
at
radcliffe
under
the
instruction
of
the
professors
in
these
courses
miss
irwin
seemed
to
have
no
objection
to
this
proposal
and
kindly
offered
to
see
the
professors
and
find
out
if
they
would
give
me
lessons
if
they
will
be
so
good
as
to
teach
me
and
if
we
have
money
enough
to
do
as
we
have
planned
my
studies
this
year
will
be
english
english
literature
of
the
elizabethan
period
latin
and
german
to
john
hitz
brattle
cambridge
as
to
the
braille
question
i
can
not
tell
how
deeply
it
distresses
me
to
hear
that
my
statement
with
regard
to
the
examinations
has
been
doubted
ignorance
seems
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
contradictions
why
you
yourself
seem
to
think
that
i
taught
you
american
braille
when
you
do
not
know
a
single
letter
in
the
system
i
could
not
help
laughing
when
you
said
you
had
been
writing
to
me
in
american
braille
and
there
you
were
writing
your
letter
in
english
braille
the
facts
about
the
braille
examinations
are
as
follows
how
i
passed
my
entrance
examinations
for
radcliffe
college
on
the
and
of
june
i
took
my
examinations
for
radcliffe
college
the
first
day
i
had
elementary
greek
and
advanced
latin
and
the
second
day
geometry
algebra
and
advanced
greek
the
college
authorities
would
not
permit
miss
sullivan
to
read
the
examination
papers
to
me
so
eugene
vining
one
of
the
instructors
at
the
perkins
institution
for
the
blind
was
employed
to
copy
the
papers
for
me
in
braille
vining
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
and
could
not
communicate
with
me
except
by
writing
in
braille
the
proctor
also
was
a
stranger
and
did
not
attempt
to
communicate
with
me
in
any
way
and
as
they
were
both
unfamiliar
with
my
speech
they
could
not
readily
understand
what
i
said
to
them
however
the
braille
worked
well
enough
in
the
languages
but
when
it
came
to
geometry
and
algebra
it
was
different
i
was
sorely
perplexed
and
felt
quite
discouraged
and
wasted
much
precious
time
especially
in
algebra
it
is
true
that
i
am
perfectly
familiar
with
all
literary
braille
english
american
and
new
york
point
but
the
method
of
writing
the
various
signs
used
in
geometry
and
algebra
in
the
three
systems
is
very
different
and
two
days
before
the
examinations
i
knew
only
the
english
method
i
had
used
it
all
through
my
school
work
and
never
any
other
system
in
geometry
my
chief
difficulty
was
that
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
reading
the
propositions
in
line
print
or
having
them
spelled
into
my
hand
and
somehow
although
the
propositions
were
right
before
me
yet
the
braille
confused
me
and
i
could
not
fix
in
my
mind
clearly
what
i
was
reading
but
when
i
took
up
algebra
i
had
a
harder
time
still
i
was
terribly
handicapped
by
my
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
notation
the
signs
which
i
had
learned
the
day
before
and
which
i
thought
i
knew
perfectly
confused
me
consequently
my
work
was
painfully
slow
and
i
was
obliged
to
read
the
examples
over
and
over
before
i
could
form
a
clear
idea
what
i
was
required
to
do
indeed
i
am
not
sure
now
that
i
read
all
the
signs
correctly
especially
as
i
was
much
distressed
and
found
it
very
hard
to
keep
my
wits
about
me
now
there
is
one
more
fact
which
i
wish
to
state
very
plainly
in
regard
to
what
gilman
wrote
to
you
i
never
received
any
direct
instruction
in
the
gilman
school
miss
sullivan
always
sat
beside
me
and
told
me
what
the
teachers
said
i
did
teach
miss
hall
my
teacher
in
physics
how
to
write
the
american
braille
but
she
never
gave
me
any
instruction
by
means
of
it
unless
a
few
problems
written
for
practice
which
made
me
waste
much
precious
time
deciphering
them
can
be
called
instruction
dear
frau
grote
learned
the
manual
alphabet
and
used
to
teach
me
herself
but
this
was
in
private
lessons
which
were
paid
for
by
my
friends
in
the
german
class
miss
sullivan
interpreted
to
me
as
well
as
she
could
what
the
teacher
said
perhaps
if
you
would
send
a
copy
of
this
to
the
head
of
the
cambridge
school
it
might
enlighten
his
mind
on
a
few
subjects
on
which
he
seems
to
be
in
total
darkness
just
now
to
miss
mildred
keller
brattle
street
cambridge
november
at
last
we
are
settled
for
the
winter
and
our
work
is
going
smoothly
keith
comes
every
afternoon
at
four
and
gives
me
a
friendly
lift
over
the
rough
stretches
of
road
over
which
every
student
must
go
i
am
studying
english
history
english
literature
french
and
latin
and
by
and
by
i
shall
take
up
german
and
english
composition
let
us
groan
you
know
i
detest
grammar
as
much
as
you
do
but
i
suppose
i
must
go
through
it
if
i
am
to
write
just
as
we
had
to
get
ducked
in
the
lake
hundreds
of
times
before
we
could
swim
in
french
teacher
is
reading
columba
to
me
it
is
a
delightful
novel
full
of
piquant
expressions
and
thrilling
adventures
do
dare
to
blame
me
for
using
big
words
since
you
do
the
same
and
if
you
ever
read
it
i
think
you
will
enjoy
it
immensely
you
are
studying
english
history
are
you
o
but
it
exceedingly
interesting
i
making
quite
a
thorough
study
of
the
elizabethan
period
of
the
reformation
and
the
acts
of
supremacy
and
conformity
and
the
maritime
discoveries
and
all
the
big
things
which
the
deuce
seems
to
have
invented
to
plague
innocent
youngsters
like
yourself
now
we
have
a
swell
winter
outfit
coats
hats
gowns
flannels
and
all
we
just
had
four
lovely
dresses
made
by
a
french
dressmaker
i
have
two
of
which
one
has
a
black
silk
skirt
with
a
black
lace
net
over
it
and
a
waist
of
white
poplin
with
turquoise
velvet
and
chiffon
and
cream
lace
over
a
satin
yoke
the
other
is
woollen
and
of
a
very
pretty
green
the
waist
is
trimmed
with
pink
and
green
brocaded
velvet
and
white
lace
i
think
and
has
double
reefers
on
the
front
tucked
and
trimmed
with
velvet
and
also
a
row
of
tiny
white
buttons
teacher
too
has
a
silk
dress
the
skirt
is
black
while
the
waist
is
mostly
yellow
trimmed
with
delicate
lavender
chiffon
and
black
velvet
bows
and
lace
her
other
dress
is
purple
trimmed
with
purple
velvet
and
the
waist
has
a
collar
of
cream
lace
so
you
may
imagine
that
we
look
quite
like
peacocks
only
we
no
trains
a
week
ago
yesterday
there
was
a
great
football
game
between
harvard
and
yale
and
there
was
tremendous
excitement
here
we
could
hear
the
yells
of
the
boys
and
the
cheers
of
the
as
plainly
in
our
room
as
if
we
had
been
on
the
field
colonel
roosevelt
was
there
on
harvard
side
but
bless
you
he
wore
a
white
sweater
and
no
crimson
that
we
know
of
there
were
about
thousand
people
at
the
game
and
when
we
went
out
the
noise
was
so
terrific
we
nearly
jumped
out
of
our
skins
thinking
it
was
the
din
of
war
and
not
of
a
football
game
that
we
heard
but
in
spite
of
all
their
wild
efforts
neither
side
was
scored
and
we
all
laughed
and
said
oh
well
now
the
pot
ca
call
the
kettle
black
to
laurence
hutton
madison
avenue
new
york
january
we
have
been
here
a
week
now
and
are
going
to
stay
with
miss
rhoades
until
saturday
we
are
enjoying
every
moment
of
our
visit
every
one
is
so
good
to
us
we
have
seen
many
of
our
old
friends
and
made
some
new
ones
we
dined
with
the
rogers
last
friday
and
oh
they
were
so
kind
to
us
the
thought
of
their
gentle
courtesy
and
genuine
kindness
brings
a
warm
glow
of
joy
and
gratitude
to
my
heart
i
have
seen
greer
too
he
has
such
a
kind
heart
i
love
him
more
than
ever
we
went
to
bartholomew
sunday
and
i
have
not
felt
so
much
at
home
in
a
church
since
dear
bishop
brooks
died
greer
read
so
slowly
that
my
teacher
could
tell
me
every
word
his
people
must
have
wondered
at
his
unusual
deliberation
after
the
service
he
asked
warren
the
organist
to
play
for
me
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
church
where
the
vibrations
from
the
great
organ
were
strongest
and
i
felt
the
mighty
waves
of
sound
beat
against
me
as
the
great
billows
beat
against
a
little
ship
at
sea
to
john
hitz
brattle
street
cambridge
my
studies
are
more
interesting
than
ever
in
latin
i
am
reading
horace
odes
although
i
find
them
difficult
to
translate
yet
i
think
they
are
the
loveliest
pieces
of
latin
poetry
i
have
read
or
shall
ever
read
in
french
we
have
finished
colomba
and
i
am
reading
horace
by
corneille
and
la
fontaine
fables
both
of
which
are
in
braille
i
have
not
gone
far
in
either
but
i
know
i
shall
enjoy
the
fables
they
are
so
delightfully
written
and
give
such
good
lessons
in
a
simple
and
yet
attractive
way
i
do
not
think
i
have
told
you
that
my
dear
teacher
is
reading
the
faery
queen
to
me
i
am
afraid
i
find
fault
with
the
poem
as
much
as
i
enjoy
it
i
do
not
care
much
for
the
allegories
indeed
i
often
find
them
tiresome
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
spenser
world
of
knights
paynims
fairies
dragons
and
all
sorts
of
strange
creatures
is
a
somewhat
grotesque
and
amusing
world
but
the
poem
itself
is
lovely
and
as
musical
as
a
running
brook
i
am
now
the
proud
owner
of
about
fifteen
new
books
which
we
ordered
from
louisville
among
them
are
henry
esmond
essays
and
extracts
from
english
literature
perhaps
next
week
i
shall
have
some
more
books
the
tempest
a
midsummer
dream
and
possibly
some
selections
from
green
history
of
england
am
i
not
very
fortunate
i
am
afraid
this
letter
savors
too
much
of
books
but
really
they
make
up
my
whole
life
these
days
and
i
scarcely
see
or
hear
of
anything
else
i
do
believe
i
sleep
on
books
every
night
you
know
a
student
life
is
of
necessity
somewhat
circumscribed
and
narrow
and
crowds
out
almost
everything
that
is
not
in
books
to
the
chairman
of
the
academic
board
of
radcliffe
college
brattle
street
cambridge
may
dear
sir
as
an
aid
to
me
in
determining
my
plans
for
study
the
coming
year
i
apply
to
you
for
information
as
to
the
possibility
of
my
taking
the
regular
courses
in
radcliffe
college
since
receiving
my
certificate
of
admission
to
radcliffe
last
july
i
have
been
studying
with
a
private
tutor
horace
aeschylus
french
german
rhetoric
english
history
english
literature
and
criticism
and
english
composition
in
college
i
should
wish
to
continue
most
if
not
all
of
these
subjects
the
conditions
under
which
i
work
require
the
presence
of
miss
sullivan
who
has
been
my
teacher
and
companion
for
thirteen
years
as
an
interpreter
of
oral
speech
and
as
a
reader
of
examination
papers
in
college
she
or
possibly
in
some
subjects
some
one
else
would
of
necessity
be
with
me
in
the
and
at
recitations
i
should
do
all
my
written
work
on
a
typewriter
and
if
a
professor
could
not
understand
my
speech
i
could
write
out
my
answers
to
his
questions
and
hand
them
to
him
after
the
recitation
is
it
possible
for
the
college
to
accommodate
itself
to
these
unprecedented
conditions
so
as
to
enable
me
to
pursue
my
studies
at
radcliffe
i
realize
that
the
obstacles
in
the
way
of
my
receiving
a
college
education
are
very
great
to
others
they
may
seem
insurmountable
but
dear
sir
a
true
soldier
does
not
acknowledge
defeat
before
the
battle
to
laurence
hutton
brattle
street
cambridge
june
i
have
not
yet
heard
from
the
academic
board
in
reply
to
my
letter
but
i
sincerely
hope
they
will
answer
favorably
my
friends
think
it
very
strange
that
they
should
hesitate
so
long
especially
when
i
have
not
asked
them
to
simplify
my
work
in
the
least
but
only
to
modify
it
so
as
to
meet
the
existing
circumstances
cornell
has
offered
to
make
arrangements
suited
to
the
conditions
under
which
i
work
if
i
should
decide
to
go
to
that
college
and
the
university
of
chicago
has
made
a
similar
offer
but
i
am
afraid
if
i
went
to
any
other
college
it
would
be
thought
that
i
did
not
pass
my
examinations
for
radcliffe
satisfactorily
in
the
fall
miss
keller
entered
radcliffe
college
to
john
hitz
coolidge
cambridge
has
already
communicated
with
you
in
regard
to
her
and
my
plan
of
establishing
an
institution
for
deaf
and
blind
children
at
first
i
was
most
enthusiastic
in
its
support
and
i
never
dreamed
that
any
grave
objections
could
be
raised
except
indeed
by
those
who
are
hostile
to
teacher
but
now
after
thinking
most
seriously
and
consulting
my
friends
i
have
decided
that
plan
is
by
no
means
feasible
in
my
eagerness
to
make
it
possible
for
deaf
and
blind
children
to
have
the
same
advantages
that
i
have
had
i
quite
forgot
that
there
might
be
many
obstacles
in
the
way
of
my
accomplishing
anything
like
what
proposed
my
friends
thought
we
might
have
one
or
two
pupils
in
our
own
home
thereby
securing
to
me
the
advantage
of
being
helpful
to
others
without
any
of
the
disadvantages
of
a
large
school
they
were
very
kind
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
they
spoke
more
from
a
business
than
a
humanitarian
point
of
view
i
am
sure
they
did
not
quite
understand
how
passionately
i
desire
that
all
who
are
afflicted
like
myself
shall
receive
their
rightful
inheritance
of
thought
knowledge
and
love
still
i
could
not
shut
my
eyes
to
the
force
and
weight
of
their
arguments
and
i
saw
plainly
that
i
must
abandon
scheme
as
impracticable
they
also
said
that
i
ought
to
appoint
an
advisory
committee
to
control
my
affairs
while
i
am
at
radcliffe
i
considered
this
suggestion
carefully
then
i
told
rhoades
that
i
should
be
proud
and
glad
to
have
wise
friends
to
whom
i
could
always
turn
for
advice
in
all
important
matters
for
this
committee
i
chose
six
my
mother
teacher
because
she
is
like
a
mother
to
me
hutton
rhoades
greer
and
rogers
because
it
is
they
who
have
supported
me
all
these
years
and
made
it
possible
for
me
to
enter
college
hutton
had
already
written
to
mother
asking
her
to
telegraph
if
she
was
willing
for
me
to
have
other
advisers
besides
herself
and
teacher
this
morning
we
received
word
that
mother
had
given
her
consent
to
this
arrangement
now
it
remains
for
me
to
write
to
greer
and
rogers
we
had
a
long
talk
with
bell
finally
he
proposed
a
plan
which
delighted
us
all
beyond
words
he
said
that
it
was
a
gigantic
blunder
to
attempt
to
found
a
school
for
deaf
and
blind
children
because
then
they
would
lose
the
most
precious
opportunities
of
entering
into
the
fuller
richer
freer
life
of
seeing
and
hearing
children
i
had
had
misgivings
on
this
point
but
i
could
not
see
how
we
were
to
help
it
however
bell
suggested
that
and
all
her
friends
who
are
interested
in
her
scheme
should
organize
an
association
for
the
promotion
of
the
education
of
the
deaf
and
blind
teacher
and
myself
being
included
of
course
under
his
plan
they
were
to
appoint
teacher
to
train
others
to
instruct
deaf
and
blind
children
in
their
own
homes
just
as
she
had
taught
me
funds
were
to
be
raised
for
the
teachers
lodgings
and
also
for
their
salaries
at
the
same
time
bell
added
that
i
could
rest
content
and
fight
my
way
through
radcliffe
in
competition
with
seeing
and
hearing
girls
while
the
great
desire
of
my
heart
was
being
fulfilled
we
clapped
our
hands
and
shouted
went
away
beaming
with
pleasure
and
teacher
and
i
felt
more
light
of
heart
than
we
had
for
sometime
of
course
we
can
do
nothing
just
now
but
the
painful
anxiety
about
my
college
work
and
the
future
welfare
of
the
deaf
and
blind
has
been
lifted
from
our
minds
do
tell
me
what
you
think
about
bell
suggestion
it
seems
most
practical
and
wise
to
me
but
i
must
know
all
that
there
is
to
be
known
about
it
before
i
speak
or
act
in
the
matter
to
john
wright
cambridge
december
do
you
think
me
a
villain
and
i
ca
think
of
a
word
bad
enough
to
express
your
opinion
of
me
unless
indeed
will
answer
the
purpose
tell
me
truly
do
you
think
me
as
bad
as
that
i
hope
not
for
i
have
thought
many
letters
to
you
which
never
got
on
paper
and
i
am
delighted
to
get
your
good
letter
yes
i
really
was
and
i
intended
to
answer
it
immediately
but
the
days
slip
by
unnoticed
when
one
is
busy
and
i
have
been
very
busy
this
fall
you
must
believe
that
radcliffe
girls
are
always
up
to
their
ears
in
work
if
you
doubt
it
you
better
come
and
see
for
yourself
yes
i
am
taking
the
regular
college
course
for
a
degree
when
i
am
a
i
suppose
you
will
not
dare
call
me
a
villain
i
am
studying
english
sophomore
english
if
you
please
though
i
ca
see
that
it
is
different
from
just
plain
english
german
french
and
history
i
enjoying
my
work
even
more
than
i
expected
to
which
is
another
way
of
saying
that
i
glad
i
came
it
is
hard
very
hard
at
times
but
it
has
swamped
me
yet
no
i
am
not
studying
mathematics
or
greek
or
latin
either
the
courses
at
radcliffe
are
elective
only
certain
courses
in
english
are
prescribed
i
passed
off
my
english
and
advanced
french
before
i
entered
college
and
i
choose
the
courses
i
like
best
i
do
however
intend
to
give
up
latin
and
greek
entirely
perhaps
i
shall
take
up
these
studies
later
but
i
said
goodbye
to
mathematics
forever
and
i
assure
you
i
was
delighted
to
see
the
last
of
those
horrid
goblins
i
hope
to
obtain
my
degree
in
four
years
but
i
not
very
particular
about
that
there
no
great
hurry
and
i
want
to
get
as
much
as
possible
out
of
my
studies
many
of
my
friends
would
be
well
pleased
if
i
would
take
two
or
even
one
course
a
year
but
i
rather
object
to
spending
the
rest
of
my
life
in
college
to
william
wade
coolidge
avenue
cambridge
december
since
you
are
so
much
interested
in
the
deaf
and
blind
i
will
begin
by
telling
you
of
several
cases
i
have
come
across
lately
last
october
i
heard
of
an
unusually
bright
little
girl
in
texas
her
name
is
ruby
rice
and
she
is
thirteen
years
old
i
think
she
has
never
been
taught
but
they
say
she
can
sew
and
likes
to
help
others
in
this
sort
of
work
her
sense
of
smell
is
wonderful
why
when
she
enters
a
store
she
will
go
straight
to
the
showcases
and
she
can
also
distinguish
her
own
things
her
parents
are
very
anxious
indeed
to
find
a
teacher
for
her
they
have
also
written
to
hitz
about
her
i
also
know
a
child
at
the
institution
for
the
deaf
in
mississippi
her
name
is
maud
scott
and
she
is
six
years
old
miss
watkins
the
lady
who
has
charge
of
her
wrote
me
a
most
interesting
letter
she
said
that
maud
was
born
deaf
and
lost
her
sight
when
she
was
only
three
months
old
and
that
when
she
went
to
the
institution
a
few
weeks
ago
she
was
quite
helpless
she
could
not
even
walk
and
had
very
little
use
of
her
hands
when
they
tried
to
teach
her
to
string
beads
her
little
hands
fell
to
her
side
evidently
her
sense
of
touch
has
not
been
developed
and
as
yet
she
can
walk
only
when
she
holds
some
one
hand
but
she
seems
to
be
an
exceedingly
bright
child
miss
watkins
adds
that
she
is
very
pretty
i
have
written
to
her
that
when
maud
learns
to
read
i
shall
have
many
stories
to
send
her
the
dear
sweet
little
girl
it
makes
my
heart
ache
to
think
how
utterly
she
is
cut
off
from
all
that
is
good
and
desirable
in
life
but
miss
watkins
seems
to
be
just
the
kind
of
teacher
she
needs
i
was
in
new
york
not
long
ago
and
i
saw
miss
rhoades
who
told
me
that
she
had
seen
katie
mcgirr
she
said
the
poor
young
girl
talked
and
acted
exactly
like
a
little
child
katie
played
with
miss
rhoades
rings
and
took
them
away
saying
with
a
merry
laugh
you
shall
not
have
them
again
she
could
only
understand
miss
rhoades
when
she
talked
about
the
simplest
things
the
latter
wished
to
send
her
some
books
but
she
could
not
find
anything
simple
enough
for
her
she
said
katie
was
very
sweet
indeed
but
sadly
in
need
of
proper
instruction
i
was
much
surprised
to
hear
all
this
for
i
judged
from
your
letters
that
katie
was
a
very
precocious
girl
a
few
days
ago
i
met
tommy
stringer
in
the
railroad
station
at
wrentham
he
is
a
great
strong
boy
now
and
he
will
soon
need
a
man
to
take
care
of
him
he
is
really
too
big
for
a
lady
to
manage
he
goes
to
the
public
school
i
hear
and
his
progress
is
astonishing
they
say
but
it
does
show
as
yet
in
his
conversation
which
is
limited
to
yes
and
to
charles
copeland
december
my
dear
copeland
i
venture
to
write
to
you
because
i
am
afraid
that
if
i
do
not
explain
why
i
have
stopped
writing
themes
you
will
think
i
have
become
discouraged
or
perhaps
that
to
escape
criticism
i
have
beat
a
cowardly
retreat
from
your
class
please
do
not
think
either
of
these
very
unpleasant
thoughts
i
am
not
discouraged
nor
am
i
afraid
i
am
confident
that
i
could
go
on
writing
themes
like
those
i
have
written
and
i
suppose
i
should
get
through
the
course
with
fairly
good
marks
but
this
sort
of
literary
has
lost
all
interest
for
me
i
have
never
been
satisfied
with
my
work
but
i
never
knew
what
my
difficulty
was
until
you
pointed
it
out
to
me
when
i
came
to
your
class
last
october
i
was
trying
with
all
my
might
to
be
like
everybody
else
to
forget
as
entirely
as
possible
my
limitations
and
peculiar
environment
now
however
i
see
the
folly
of
attempting
to
hitch
one
wagon
to
a
star
with
harness
that
does
not
belong
to
it
i
have
always
accepted
other
peoples
experiences
and
observations
as
a
matter
of
course
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
worth
while
to
make
my
own
observations
and
describe
the
experiences
peculiarly
my
own
henceforth
i
am
resolved
to
be
myself
to
live
my
own
life
and
write
my
own
thoughts
when
i
have
any
when
i
have
written
something
that
seems
to
be
fresh
and
spontaneous
and
worthy
of
your
criticisms
i
will
bring
it
to
you
if
i
may
and
if
you
think
it
good
i
shall
be
happy
but
if
your
verdict
is
unfavorable
i
shall
try
again
and
yet
again
until
i
have
succeeded
in
pleasing
you
to
laurence
hutton
coolidge
avenue
cambridge
december
so
you
read
about
our
class
luncheon
in
the
papers
how
in
the
world
do
the
papers
find
out
everything
i
wonder
i
am
sure
no
reporter
was
present
i
had
a
splendid
time
the
toasts
and
speeches
were
great
fun
i
only
spoke
a
few
words
as
i
did
not
know
i
was
expected
to
speak
until
a
few
minutes
before
i
was
called
upon
i
think
i
wrote
you
that
i
had
been
elected
of
the
freshman
class
of
radcliffe
did
i
tell
you
in
my
last
letter
that
i
had
a
new
dress
a
real
party
dress
with
low
neck
and
short
sleeves
and
quite
a
train
it
is
pale
blue
trimmed
with
chiffon
of
the
same
color
i
have
worn
it
only
once
but
then
i
felt
that
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
to
be
compared
with
me
anyway
he
certainly
never
had
a
dress
like
mine
a
gentleman
in
philadelphia
has
just
written
to
my
teacher
about
a
deaf
and
blind
child
in
paris
whose
parents
are
poles
the
mother
is
a
physician
and
a
brilliant
woman
he
says
this
little
boy
could
speak
two
or
three
languages
before
he
lost
his
hearing
through
sickness
and
he
is
now
only
about
five
years
old
poor
little
fellow
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
him
but
he
is
so
young
my
teacher
thinks
it
would
be
too
bad
to
separate
him
from
his
mother
i
have
had
a
letter
from
thaw
with
regard
to
the
possibility
of
doing
something
for
these
children
bell
thinks
the
present
census
will
show
that
there
are
more
than
a
thousand
in
the
united
states
alone
the
number
of
young
enough
to
be
benefited
by
education
is
not
so
large
as
this
but
the
education
of
this
class
of
defectives
has
been
neglected
and
thaw
thinks
if
all
my
friends
were
to
unite
their
efforts
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
establish
at
the
beginning
of
this
new
century
a
new
line
upon
which
mercy
might
travel
and
the
rescue
of
these
unfortunate
children
could
be
accomplished
to
william
wade
cambridge
february
by
the
way
have
you
any
specimens
of
english
braille
especially
printed
for
those
who
have
lost
their
sight
late
in
life
or
have
fingers
hardened
by
long
toil
so
that
their
touch
is
less
sensitive
than
that
of
other
blind
people
i
read
an
account
of
such
a
system
in
one
of
my
english
magazines
and
i
am
anxious
to
know
more
about
it
if
it
is
as
efficient
as
they
say
i
see
no
reason
why
english
braille
should
not
be
adopted
by
the
blind
of
all
countries
why
it
is
the
print
that
can
be
most
readily
adapted
to
many
different
languages
even
greek
can
be
embossed
in
it
as
you
know
then
too
it
will
be
rendered
still
more
efficient
by
the
interpointing
system
which
will
save
an
immense
amount
of
space
and
paper
there
is
nothing
more
absurd
i
think
than
to
have
five
or
six
different
prints
for
the
blind
this
letter
was
written
in
response
to
a
tentative
offer
from
the
editor
of
the
great
round
world
to
have
the
magazine
published
in
raised
type
for
the
blind
if
enough
were
willing
to
subscribe
it
is
evident
that
the
blind
should
have
a
good
magazine
not
a
special
magazine
for
the
blind
but
one
of
our
best
monthlies
printed
in
embossed
letters
the
blind
alone
could
not
support
it
but
it
would
not
take
very
much
money
to
make
up
the
additional
expense
to
the
great
round
world
cambridge
the
great
round
world
new
york
city
gentlemen
i
have
only
found
time
to
reply
to
your
interesting
letter
a
little
bird
had
already
sung
the
good
news
in
my
ear
but
it
was
doubly
pleasant
to
have
it
straight
from
you
it
would
be
splendid
to
have
the
great
round
world
printed
in
language
that
can
be
felt
i
doubt
if
any
one
who
enjoys
the
wondrous
privilege
of
seeing
can
have
any
conception
of
the
boon
such
a
publication
as
you
contemplate
would
be
to
the
sightless
to
be
able
to
read
for
one
self
what
is
being
willed
thought
and
done
in
the
world
the
world
in
whose
joys
and
sorrows
failures
and
successes
one
feels
the
keenest
interest
that
would
indeed
be
a
happiness
too
deep
for
words
i
trust
that
the
effort
of
the
great
round
world
to
bring
light
to
those
who
sit
in
darkness
will
receive
the
encouragement
and
support
it
so
richly
deserves
i
doubt
however
if
the
number
of
subscribers
to
an
embossed
edition
of
the
great
round
world
would
ever
be
large
for
i
am
told
that
the
blind
as
a
class
are
poor
but
why
should
not
the
friends
of
the
blind
assist
the
great
round
world
if
necessary
surely
there
are
hearts
and
hands
ever
ready
to
make
it
possible
for
generous
intentions
to
be
wrought
into
noble
deeds
wishing
you
godspeed
in
an
undertaking
that
is
very
dear
to
my
heart
i
am
etc
to
miss
nina
rhoades
cambridge
we
remained
in
halifax
until
about
the
middle
of
august
day
after
day
the
harbor
the
warships
and
the
park
kept
us
busy
thinking
and
feeling
and
enjoying
when
the
indiana
visited
halifax
we
were
invited
to
go
on
board
and
she
sent
her
own
launch
for
us
i
touched
the
immense
cannon
read
with
my
fingers
several
of
the
names
of
the
spanish
ships
that
were
captured
at
santiago
and
felt
the
places
where
she
had
been
pierced
with
shells
the
indiana
was
the
largest
and
finest
ship
in
the
harbor
and
we
felt
very
proud
of
her
after
we
left
halifax
we
visited
bell
at
cape
breton
he
has
a
charming
romantic
house
on
a
mountain
called
beinn
bhreagh
which
overlooks
the
bras
lake
bell
told
me
many
interesting
things
about
his
work
he
had
just
constructed
a
boat
that
could
be
propelled
by
a
kite
with
the
wind
in
its
favor
and
one
day
he
tried
experiments
to
see
if
he
could
steer
the
kite
against
the
wind
i
was
there
and
really
helped
him
fly
the
kites
on
one
of
them
i
noticed
that
the
strings
were
of
wire
and
having
had
some
experience
in
bead
work
i
said
i
thought
they
would
break
bell
said
no
with
great
confidence
and
the
kite
was
sent
up
it
began
to
pull
and
tug
and
lo
the
wires
broke
and
off
went
the
great
red
dragon
and
poor
bell
stood
looking
forlornly
after
it
after
that
he
asked
me
if
the
strings
were
all
right
and
changed
them
at
once
when
i
answered
in
the
negative
altogether
we
had
great
fun
to
edward
everett
hale
read
by
hale
at
the
celebration
of
the
centenary
of
samuel
gridley
howe
at
tremont
temple
boston
cambridge
my
teacher
and
i
expect
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
tomorrow
in
commemoration
of
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
birth
but
i
very
much
doubt
if
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
you
so
i
am
writing
now
to
tell
you
how
delighted
i
am
that
you
are
to
speak
at
the
meeting
because
i
feel
that
you
better
than
any
one
i
know
will
express
the
heartfelt
gratitude
of
those
who
owe
their
education
their
opportunities
their
happiness
to
him
who
opened
the
eyes
of
the
blind
and
gave
the
dumb
lip
language
sitting
here
in
my
study
surrounded
by
my
books
enjoying
the
sweet
and
intimate
companionship
of
the
great
and
the
wise
i
am
trying
to
realize
what
my
life
might
have
been
if
howe
had
failed
in
the
great
task
god
gave
him
to
perform
if
he
had
not
taken
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
laura
education
and
led
her
out
of
the
pit
of
acheron
back
to
her
human
inheritance
should
i
be
a
sophomore
at
radcliffe
college
who
can
say
but
it
is
idle
to
speculate
about
what
might
have
been
in
connection
with
howe
great
achievement
i
think
only
those
who
have
escaped
that
existence
from
which
laura
bridgman
was
rescued
can
realize
how
isolated
how
shrouded
in
darkness
how
cramped
by
its
own
impotence
is
a
soul
without
thought
or
faith
or
hope
words
are
powerless
to
describe
the
desolation
of
that
or
the
joy
of
the
soul
that
is
delivered
out
of
its
captivity
when
we
compare
the
needs
and
helplessness
of
the
blind
before
howe
began
his
work
with
their
present
usefulness
and
independence
we
realize
that
great
things
have
been
done
in
our
midst
what
if
physical
conditions
have
built
up
high
walls
about
us
thanks
to
our
friend
and
helper
our
world
lies
upward
the
length
and
breadth
and
sweep
of
the
heavens
are
ours
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
howe
noble
deeds
will
receive
their
due
tribute
of
affection
and
gratitude
in
the
city
which
was
the
scene
of
his
great
labors
and
splendid
victories
for
humanity
with
kind
greetings
in
which
my
teacher
joins
me
i
am
affectionately
your
friend
helen
keller
to
the
hon
george
frisbie
hoar
cambridge
november
my
dear
senator
hoar
i
am
glad
you
liked
my
letter
about
howe
it
was
written
out
of
my
heart
and
perhaps
that
is
why
it
met
a
sympathetic
response
in
other
hearts
i
will
ask
hale
to
lend
me
the
letter
so
that
i
can
make
a
copy
of
it
for
you
you
see
i
use
a
typewriter
it
is
my
right
hand
man
so
to
speak
without
it
i
do
not
see
how
i
could
go
to
college
i
write
all
my
themes
and
examinations
on
it
even
greek
indeed
it
has
only
one
drawback
and
that
probably
is
regarded
as
an
advantage
by
the
professors
it
is
that
one
mistakes
may
be
detected
at
a
glance
for
there
is
no
chance
to
hide
them
in
illegible
writing
i
know
you
will
be
amused
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
deeply
interested
in
politics
i
like
to
have
the
papers
read
to
me
and
i
try
to
understand
the
great
questions
of
the
day
but
i
am
afraid
my
knowledge
is
very
unstable
for
i
change
my
opinions
with
every
new
book
i
read
i
used
to
think
that
when
i
studied
civil
government
and
economics
all
my
difficulties
and
perplexities
would
blossom
into
beautiful
certainties
but
alas
i
find
that
there
are
more
tares
than
wheat
in
these
fertile
fields
of
knowledge
iii
a
supplementary
account
of
helen
keller
life
and
education
chapter
i
the
writing
of
the
book
it
is
fitting
that
miss
keller
story
of
my
life
should
appear
at
this
time
what
is
remarkable
in
her
career
is
already
accomplished
and
whatever
she
may
do
in
the
future
will
be
but
a
relatively
slight
addition
to
the
success
which
distinguishes
her
now
that
success
has
just
been
assured
for
it
is
her
work
at
radcliffe
during
the
last
two
years
which
has
shown
that
she
can
carry
her
education
as
far
as
if
she
were
studying
under
normal
conditions
whatever
doubts
miss
keller
herself
may
have
had
are
now
at
rest
several
passages
of
her
autobiography
as
it
appeared
in
serial
form
have
been
made
the
subject
of
a
grave
editorial
in
a
boston
newspaper
in
which
the
writer
regretted
miss
keller
apparent
disillusionment
in
regard
to
the
value
of
her
college
life
he
quoted
the
passages
in
which
she
explains
that
college
is
not
the
universal
athens
she
had
hoped
to
find
and
cited
the
cases
of
other
remarkable
persons
whose
college
life
had
proved
disappointing
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
miss
keller
has
written
many
things
in
her
autobiography
for
the
fun
of
writing
them
and
the
disillusion
which
the
writer
of
the
editorial
took
seriously
is
in
great
part
humorous
miss
keller
does
not
suppose
her
views
to
be
of
great
importance
and
when
she
utters
her
opinions
on
important
matters
she
takes
it
for
granted
that
her
reader
will
receive
them
as
the
opinions
of
a
junior
in
college
not
of
one
who
writes
with
the
wisdom
of
maturity
for
instance
it
surprised
her
that
some
people
were
annoyed
at
what
she
said
about
the
bible
and
she
was
amused
that
they
did
not
see
what
was
plain
enough
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
read
the
whole
bible
in
a
course
in
english
literature
not
as
a
religious
duty
put
upon
her
by
her
teacher
or
her
parents
i
ought
to
apologize
to
the
reader
and
to
miss
keller
for
presuming
to
say
what
her
subject
matter
is
worth
but
one
more
explanation
is
necessary
in
her
account
of
her
early
education
miss
keller
is
not
giving
a
scientifically
accurate
record
of
her
life
nor
even
of
the
important
events
she
can
not
know
in
detail
how
she
was
taught
and
her
memory
of
her
childhood
is
in
some
cases
an
idealized
memory
of
what
she
has
learned
later
from
her
teacher
and
others
she
is
less
able
to
recall
events
of
fifteen
years
ago
than
most
of
us
are
to
recollect
our
childhood
that
is
why
her
teacher
records
may
be
found
to
differ
in
some
particulars
from
miss
keller
account
the
way
in
which
miss
keller
wrote
her
story
shows
as
nothing
else
can
show
the
difficulties
she
had
to
overcome
when
we
write
we
can
go
back
over
our
work
shuffle
the
pages
interline
rearrange
see
how
the
paragraphs
look
in
proof
and
so
construct
the
whole
work
before
the
eye
as
an
architect
constructs
his
plans
when
miss
keller
puts
her
work
in
typewritten
form
she
can
not
refer
to
it
again
unless
some
one
reads
it
to
her
by
means
of
the
manual
alphabet
this
difficulty
is
in
part
obviated
by
the
use
of
her
braille
machine
which
makes
a
manuscript
that
she
can
read
but
as
her
work
must
be
put
ultimately
in
typewritten
form
and
as
a
braille
machine
is
somewhat
cumbersome
she
has
got
into
the
habit
of
writing
directly
on
her
typewriter
she
depends
so
little
on
her
braille
manuscript
that
when
she
began
to
write
her
story
more
than
a
year
ago
and
had
put
in
braille
a
hundred
pages
of
material
and
notes
she
made
the
mistake
of
destroying
these
notes
before
she
had
finished
her
manuscript
thus
she
composed
much
of
her
story
on
the
typewriter
and
in
constructing
it
as
a
whole
depended
on
her
memory
to
guide
her
in
putting
together
the
detached
episodes
which
miss
sullivan
read
over
to
her
last
july
when
she
had
finished
under
great
pressure
of
work
her
final
chapter
she
set
to
work
to
rewrite
the
whole
story
her
good
friend
william
wade
had
a
complete
braille
copy
made
for
her
from
the
magazine
proofs
then
for
the
first
time
she
had
her
whole
manuscript
under
her
finger
at
once
she
saw
imperfections
in
the
arrangement
of
paragraphs
and
the
repetition
of
phrases
she
saw
too
that
her
story
properly
fell
into
short
chapters
and
redivided
it
partly
from
temperament
partly
from
the
conditions
of
her
work
she
has
written
rather
a
series
of
brilliant
passages
than
a
unified
narrative
in
point
of
fact
several
paragraphs
of
her
story
are
short
themes
written
in
her
english
courses
and
the
small
unit
sometimes
shows
its
original
limits
in
rewriting
the
story
miss
keller
made
corrections
on
separate
pages
on
her
braille
machine
long
corrections
she
wrote
out
on
her
typewriter
with
to
indicate
where
they
belonged
then
she
read
from
her
braille
copy
the
entire
story
making
corrections
as
she
read
which
were
taken
down
on
the
manuscript
that
went
to
the
printer
during
this
revision
she
discussed
questions
of
subject
matter
and
phrasing
she
sat
running
her
finger
over
the
braille
manuscript
stopping
now
and
then
to
refer
to
the
braille
notes
on
which
she
had
indicated
her
corrections
all
the
time
reading
aloud
to
verify
the
manuscript
she
listened
to
criticism
just
as
any
author
listens
to
his
friends
or
his
editor
miss
sullivan
who
is
an
excellent
critic
made
suggestions
at
many
points
in
the
course
of
composition
and
revision
one
newspaper
suggested
that
miss
keller
had
been
led
into
writing
the
book
and
had
been
influenced
to
put
certain
things
into
it
by
zealous
friends
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
the
advice
she
has
received
and
heeded
has
led
to
excisions
rather
than
to
additions
the
book
is
miss
keller
and
is
final
proof
of
her
independent
power
chapter
ii
personality
mark
twain
has
said
that
the
two
most
interesting
characters
of
the
nineteenth
century
are
napoleon
and
helen
keller
the
admiration
with
which
the
world
has
regarded
her
is
more
than
justified
by
what
she
has
done
no
one
can
tell
any
great
truth
about
her
which
has
not
already
been
written
and
all
that
i
can
do
is
to
give
a
few
more
facts
about
miss
keller
work
and
add
a
little
to
what
is
known
of
her
personality
miss
keller
is
tall
and
strongly
built
and
has
always
had
good
health
she
seems
to
be
more
nervous
than
she
really
is
because
she
expresses
more
with
her
hands
than
do
most
people
one
reason
for
this
habit
of
gesture
is
that
her
hands
have
been
so
long
her
instruments
of
communication
that
they
have
taken
to
themselves
the
quick
shiftings
of
the
eye
and
express
some
of
the
things
that
we
say
in
a
glance
all
deaf
people
naturally
gesticulate
indeed
at
one
time
it
was
believed
that
the
best
way
for
them
to
communicate
was
through
systematized
gestures
the
sign
language
invented
by
the
abbe
de
when
miss
keller
speaks
her
face
is
animated
and
expresses
all
the
modes
of
her
thought
the
expressions
that
make
the
features
eloquent
and
give
speech
half
its
meaning
on
the
other
hand
she
does
not
know
another
expression
when
she
is
talking
with
an
intimate
friend
however
her
hand
goes
quickly
to
her
friend
face
to
see
as
she
says
the
twist
of
the
mouth
in
this
way
she
is
able
to
get
the
meaning
of
those
half
sentences
which
we
complete
unconsciously
from
the
tone
of
the
voice
or
the
twinkle
of
the
eye
her
memory
of
people
is
remarkable
she
remembers
the
grasp
of
fingers
she
has
held
before
all
the
characteristic
tightening
of
the
muscles
that
makes
one
person
handshake
different
from
that
of
another
the
trait
most
characteristic
perhaps
of
miss
keller
and
also
of
miss
sullivan
is
humour
skill
in
the
use
of
words
and
her
habit
of
playing
with
them
make
her
ready
with
mots
and
epigrams
some
one
asked
her
if
she
liked
to
study
yes
she
replied
but
i
like
to
play
also
and
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
were
a
music
box
with
all
the
play
shut
up
inside
me
when
she
met
furness
the
shakespearean
scholar
he
warned
her
not
to
let
the
college
professors
tell
her
too
many
assumed
facts
about
the
life
of
shakespeare
all
we
know
he
said
is
that
shakespeare
was
baptized
married
and
died
well
she
replied
he
seems
to
have
done
all
the
essential
things
once
a
friend
who
was
learning
the
manual
alphabet
kept
making
g
which
is
like
the
hand
of
a
for
h
which
is
made
with
two
fingers
extended
finally
miss
keller
told
him
to
fire
both
barrels
joseph
jefferson
was
once
explaining
to
miss
keller
what
the
bumps
on
her
head
meant
that
he
said
is
your
bump
i
never
fight
she
replied
except
against
difficulties
miss
keller
humour
is
that
deeper
kind
of
humour
which
is
courage
thirteen
years
ago
she
made
up
her
mind
to
learn
to
speak
and
she
gave
her
teacher
no
rest
until
she
was
allowed
to
take
lessons
although
wise
people
even
miss
sullivan
the
wisest
of
them
all
regarded
it
as
an
experiment
unlikely
to
succeed
and
almost
sure
to
make
her
unhappy
it
was
this
same
perseverance
that
made
her
go
to
college
after
she
had
passed
her
examinations
and
received
her
certificate
of
admission
she
was
advised
by
the
dean
of
radcliffe
and
others
not
to
go
on
she
accordingly
delayed
a
year
but
she
was
not
satisfied
until
she
had
carried
out
her
purpose
and
entered
college
her
life
has
been
a
series
of
attempts
to
do
whatever
other
people
do
and
to
do
it
as
well
her
success
has
been
complete
for
in
trying
to
be
like
other
people
she
has
come
most
fully
to
be
herself
her
unwillingness
to
be
beaten
has
developed
her
courage
where
another
can
go
she
can
go
her
respect
for
physical
bravery
is
like
stevenson
the
boy
contempt
for
the
fellow
who
cries
with
a
touch
of
young
bravado
in
it
she
takes
tramps
in
the
woods
plunging
through
the
underbrush
where
she
is
scratched
and
bruised
yet
you
could
not
get
her
to
admit
that
she
is
hurt
and
you
certainly
could
not
persuade
her
to
stay
at
home
next
time
so
when
people
try
experiments
with
her
she
displays
a
sportsmanlike
determination
to
win
in
any
test
however
unreasonable
that
one
may
wish
to
put
her
to
if
she
does
not
know
the
answer
to
a
question
she
guesses
with
mischievous
assurance
ask
her
the
colour
of
your
coat
no
blind
person
can
tell
colour
she
will
feel
it
and
say
black
if
it
happens
to
be
blue
and
you
tell
her
so
triumphantly
she
is
likely
to
answer
thank
you
i
am
glad
you
know
why
did
you
ask
me
her
whimsical
and
adventuresome
spirit
puts
her
so
much
on
her
mettle
that
she
makes
rather
a
poor
subject
for
the
psychological
experimenter
moreover
miss
sullivan
does
not
see
why
miss
keller
should
be
subjected
to
the
investigation
of
the
scientist
and
has
not
herself
made
many
experiments
when
a
psychologist
asked
her
if
miss
keller
spelled
on
her
fingers
in
her
sleep
miss
sullivan
replied
that
she
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
sit
up
and
watch
such
matters
were
of
so
little
consequence
miss
keller
likes
to
be
part
of
the
company
if
any
one
whom
she
is
touching
laughs
at
a
joke
she
laughs
too
just
as
if
she
had
heard
it
if
others
are
aglow
with
music
a
responding
glow
caught
sympathetically
shines
in
her
face
indeed
she
feels
the
movements
of
miss
sullivan
so
minutely
that
she
responds
to
her
moods
and
so
she
seems
to
know
what
is
going
on
even
though
the
conversation
has
not
been
spelled
to
her
for
some
time
in
the
same
way
her
response
to
music
is
in
part
sympathetic
although
she
enjoys
it
for
its
own
sake
music
probably
can
mean
little
to
her
but
beat
and
pulsation
she
can
not
sing
and
she
can
not
play
the
piano
although
as
some
early
experiments
show
she
could
learn
mechanically
to
beat
out
a
tune
on
the
keys
her
enjoyment
of
music
however
is
very
genuine
for
she
has
a
tactile
recognition
of
sound
when
the
waves
of
air
beat
against
her
part
of
her
experience
of
the
rhythm
of
music
comes
no
doubt
from
the
vibration
of
solid
objects
which
she
is
touching
the
floor
or
what
is
more
evident
the
case
of
the
piano
on
which
her
hand
rests
but
she
seems
to
feel
the
pulsation
of
the
air
itself
when
the
organ
was
played
for
her
in
bartholomew
the
whole
building
shook
with
the
great
pedal
notes
but
that
does
not
altogether
account
for
what
she
felt
and
enjoyed
the
vibration
of
the
air
as
the
organ
notes
swelled
made
her
sway
in
answer
sometimes
she
puts
her
hand
on
a
singer
throat
to
feel
the
muscular
thrill
and
contraction
and
from
this
she
gets
genuine
pleasure
no
one
knows
however
just
what
her
sensations
are
it
is
amusing
to
read
in
one
of
the
magazines
of
that
miss
keller
has
a
just
and
intelligent
appreciation
of
different
composers
from
having
literally
felt
their
music
schumann
being
her
favourite
if
she
knows
the
difference
between
schumann
and
beethoven
it
is
because
she
has
read
it
and
if
she
has
read
it
she
remembers
it
and
can
tell
any
one
who
asks
her
miss
keller
effort
to
reach
out
and
meet
other
people
on
their
own
intellectual
ground
has
kept
her
informed
of
daily
affairs
when
her
education
became
more
systematic
and
she
was
busy
with
books
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
miss
sullivan
to
let
her
draw
into
herself
if
she
had
been
so
inclined
but
every
one
who
has
met
her
has
given
his
best
ideas
to
her
and
she
has
taken
them
if
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
the
friend
next
to
her
has
ceased
for
some
moments
to
spell
into
her
hand
the
question
comes
inevitably
what
are
you
talking
about
thus
she
picks
up
the
fragments
of
the
daily
intercourse
of
normal
people
so
that
her
detailed
information
is
singularly
full
and
accurate
she
is
a
good
talker
on
the
little
occasional
affairs
of
life
much
of
her
knowledge
comes
to
her
directly
when
she
is
out
walking
she
often
stops
suddenly
attracted
by
the
odour
of
a
bit
of
shrubbery
she
reaches
out
and
touches
the
leaves
and
the
world
of
growing
things
is
hers
as
truly
as
it
is
ours
to
enjoy
while
she
holds
the
leaves
in
her
fingers
and
smells
the
blossoms
and
to
remember
when
the
walk
is
done
when
she
is
in
a
new
place
especially
an
interesting
place
like
niagara
whoever
accompanies
her
usually
of
course
miss
sullivan
is
kept
busy
giving
her
an
idea
of
visible
details
miss
sullivan
who
knows
her
pupil
mind
selects
from
the
passing
landscape
essential
elements
which
give
a
certain
clearness
to
miss
keller
imagined
view
of
an
outer
world
that
to
our
eyes
is
confused
and
overloaded
with
particulars
if
her
companion
does
not
give
her
enough
details
miss
keller
asks
questions
until
she
has
completed
the
view
to
her
satisfaction
she
does
not
see
with
her
eyes
but
through
the
inner
faculty
to
serve
which
eyes
were
given
to
us
when
she
returns
from
a
walk
and
tells
some
one
about
it
her
descriptions
are
accurate
and
vivid
a
comparative
experience
drawn
from
written
descriptions
and
from
her
teacher
words
has
kept
her
free
from
errors
in
her
use
of
terms
of
sound
and
vision
true
her
view
of
life
is
highly
coloured
and
full
of
poetic
exaggeration
the
universe
as
she
sees
it
is
no
doubt
a
little
better
than
it
really
is
but
her
knowledge
of
it
is
not
so
incomplete
as
one
might
suppose
occasionally
she
astonishes
you
by
ignorance
of
some
fact
which
no
one
happens
to
have
told
her
for
instance
she
did
not
know
until
her
first
plunge
into
the
sea
that
it
is
salt
many
of
the
detached
incidents
and
facts
of
our
daily
life
pass
around
and
over
her
unobserved
but
she
has
enough
detailed
acquaintance
with
the
world
to
keep
her
view
of
it
from
being
essentially
defective
most
that
she
knows
at
first
hand
comes
from
her
sense
of
touch
this
sense
is
not
however
so
finely
developed
as
in
some
other
blind
people
laura
bridgman
could
tell
minute
shades
of
difference
in
the
size
of
thread
and
made
beautiful
lace
miss
keller
used
to
knit
and
crochet
but
she
has
had
better
things
to
do
with
her
varied
powers
and
accomplishments
her
sense
of
touch
has
not
been
used
enough
to
develop
it
very
far
beyond
normal
acuteness
a
friend
tried
miss
keller
one
day
with
several
coins
she
was
slower
than
he
expected
her
to
be
in
identifying
them
by
their
relative
weight
and
size
but
it
should
be
said
she
almost
never
handles
money
one
of
the
many
sordid
and
petty
details
of
life
by
the
way
which
she
has
been
spared
she
recognizes
the
subject
and
general
intention
of
a
statuette
six
inches
high
anything
shallower
than
a
is
a
blank
to
her
so
far
as
it
expresses
an
idea
of
beauty
large
statues
of
which
she
can
feel
the
sweep
of
line
with
her
whole
hand
she
knows
in
their
higher
esthetic
value
she
suggests
herself
that
she
can
know
them
better
than
we
do
because
she
can
get
the
true
dimensions
and
appreciate
more
immediately
the
solid
nature
of
a
sculptured
figure
when
she
was
at
the
museum
of
fine
arts
in
boston
she
stood
on
a
and
let
both
hands
play
over
the
statues
when
she
felt
a
of
dancing
girls
she
asked
where
are
the
singers
when
she
found
them
she
said
one
is
silent
the
lips
of
the
singer
were
closed
it
is
however
in
her
daily
life
that
one
can
best
measure
the
delicacy
of
her
senses
and
her
manual
skill
she
seems
to
have
very
little
sense
of
direction
she
gropes
her
way
without
much
certainty
in
rooms
where
she
is
quite
familiar
most
blind
people
are
aided
by
the
sense
of
sound
so
that
a
fair
comparison
is
hard
to
make
except
with
other
persons
her
dexterity
is
not
notable
either
in
comparison
with
the
normal
person
whose
movements
are
guided
by
the
eye
or
i
am
told
with
other
blind
people
she
has
practised
no
single
constructive
craft
which
would
call
for
the
use
of
her
hands
when
she
was
twelve
her
friend
albert
munsell
the
artist
let
her
experiment
with
a
wax
tablet
and
a
stylus
he
says
that
she
did
pretty
well
and
managed
to
make
after
models
some
conventional
designs
of
the
outlines
of
leaves
and
rosettes
the
only
thing
she
does
which
requires
skill
with
the
hands
is
her
work
on
the
typewriter
although
she
has
used
the
typewriter
since
she
was
eleven
years
old
she
is
rather
careful
than
rapid
she
writes
with
fair
speed
and
absolute
sureness
her
manuscripts
seldom
contain
typographical
errors
when
she
hands
them
to
miss
sullivan
to
read
her
typewriter
has
no
special
attachments
she
keeps
the
relative
position
of
the
keys
by
an
occasional
touch
of
the
little
finger
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
board
miss
keller
reading
of
the
manual
alphabet
by
her
sense
of
touch
seems
to
cause
some
perplexity
even
people
who
know
her
fairly
well
have
written
in
the
magazines
about
miss
sullivan
mysterious
telegraphic
communications
with
her
pupil
the
manual
alphabet
is
that
in
use
among
all
educated
deaf
people
most
dictionaries
contain
an
engraving
of
the
manual
letters
the
deaf
person
with
sight
looks
at
the
fingers
of
his
companion
but
it
is
also
possible
to
feel
them
miss
keller
puts
her
fingers
lightly
over
the
hand
of
one
who
is
talking
to
her
and
gets
the
words
as
rapidly
as
they
can
be
spelled
as
she
explains
she
is
not
conscious
of
the
single
letters
or
of
separate
words
miss
sullivan
and
others
who
live
constantly
with
the
deaf
can
spell
very
rapidly
fast
enough
to
get
a
slow
lecture
not
fast
enough
to
get
every
word
of
a
rapid
speaker
anybody
can
learn
the
manual
letters
in
a
few
minutes
use
them
slowly
in
a
day
and
in
thirty
days
of
constant
use
talk
to
miss
keller
or
any
other
deaf
person
without
realizing
what
his
fingers
are
doing
if
more
people
knew
this
and
the
friends
and
relatives
of
deaf
children
learned
the
manual
alphabet
at
once
the
deaf
all
over
the
world
would
be
happier
and
better
educated
miss
keller
reads
by
means
of
embossed
print
or
the
various
kinds
of
braille
the
ordinary
embossed
book
is
made
with
roman
letters
both
small
letters
and
capitals
these
letters
are
of
simple
square
angular
design
the
small
letters
are
about
of
an
inch
high
and
are
raised
from
the
page
the
thickness
of
the
thumbnail
the
books
are
large
about
the
size
of
a
volume
of
an
encyclopedia
green
short
history
of
the
english
people
is
in
six
large
volumes
the
books
are
not
heavy
because
the
leaves
with
the
raised
type
do
not
lie
close
the
time
that
one
of
miss
keller
friends
realizes
most
strongly
that
she
is
blind
is
when
he
comes
on
her
suddenly
in
the
dark
and
hears
the
rustle
of
her
fingers
across
the
page
the
most
convenient
print
for
the
blind
is
braille
which
has
several
variations
too
many
indeed
english
american
new
york
point
miss
keller
reads
them
all
most
educated
blind
people
know
several
but
it
would
save
trouble
if
as
miss
keller
suggests
english
braille
were
universally
adopted
the
facsimile
on
page
xv
omitted
from
etext
gives
an
idea
of
how
the
raised
dots
look
each
character
either
a
letter
or
a
special
braille
contraction
is
a
combination
made
by
varying
in
place
and
number
points
in
six
possible
positions
miss
keller
has
a
braille
writer
on
which
she
keeps
notes
and
writes
letters
to
her
blind
friends
there
are
six
keys
and
by
pressing
different
combinations
at
a
stroke
as
one
plays
a
chord
on
the
piano
the
operator
makes
a
character
at
a
time
in
a
sheet
of
thick
paper
and
can
write
about
half
as
rapidly
as
on
a
typewriter
braille
is
especially
useful
in
making
single
manuscript
copies
of
books
books
for
the
blind
are
very
limited
in
number
they
cost
a
great
deal
to
publish
and
they
have
not
a
large
enough
sale
to
make
them
profitable
to
the
publisher
but
there
are
several
institutions
with
special
funds
to
pay
for
embossed
books
miss
keller
is
more
fortunate
than
most
blind
people
in
the
kindness
of
her
friends
who
have
books
made
especially
for
her
and
in
the
willingness
of
gentlemen
like
allen
of
the
pennsylvania
institute
for
the
instruction
of
the
blind
to
print
as
he
has
on
several
occasions
editions
of
books
that
she
has
needed
miss
keller
does
not
as
a
rule
read
very
fast
but
she
reads
deliberately
not
so
much
because
she
feels
the
words
less
quickly
than
we
see
then
as
because
it
is
one
of
her
habits
of
mind
to
do
things
thoroughly
and
well
when
a
passage
interests
her
or
she
needs
to
remember
it
for
some
future
use
she
flutters
it
off
swiftly
on
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
sometimes
this
is
unconscious
miss
keller
talks
to
herself
in
the
manual
alphabet
when
she
is
walking
up
or
down
the
hall
or
along
the
veranda
her
hands
go
flying
along
beside
her
like
a
confusion
of
birds
wings
there
is
i
am
told
tactile
memory
as
well
as
visual
and
aural
memory
miss
sullivan
says
that
both
she
and
miss
keller
remember
in
their
fingers
what
they
have
said
for
miss
keller
to
spell
a
sentence
in
the
manual
alphabet
impresses
it
on
her
mind
just
as
we
learn
a
thing
from
having
heard
it
many
times
and
can
call
back
the
memory
of
its
sound
like
every
deaf
or
blind
person
miss
keller
depends
on
her
sense
of
smell
to
an
unusual
degree
when
she
was
a
little
girl
she
smelled
everything
and
knew
where
she
was
what
neighbour
house
she
was
passing
by
the
distinctive
odours
as
her
intellect
grew
she
became
less
dependent
on
this
sense
to
what
extent
she
now
identifies
objects
by
their
odour
is
hard
to
determine
the
sense
of
smell
has
fallen
into
disrepute
and
a
deaf
person
is
reluctant
to
speak
of
it
miss
acute
sense
of
smell
may
account
however
in
some
part
for
that
recognition
of
persons
and
things
which
it
has
been
customary
to
attribute
to
a
special
sense
or
to
an
unusual
development
of
the
power
that
we
all
seem
to
have
of
telling
when
some
one
is
near
the
question
of
a
special
sixth
sense
such
as
people
have
ascribed
to
miss
keller
is
a
delicate
one
this
much
is
certain
she
can
not
have
any
sense
that
other
people
may
not
have
and
the
existence
of
a
special
sense
is
not
evident
to
her
or
to
any
one
who
knows
her
miss
keller
is
distinctly
not
a
singular
proof
of
occult
and
mysterious
theories
and
any
attempt
to
explain
her
in
that
way
fails
to
reckon
with
her
normality
she
is
no
more
mysterious
and
complex
than
any
other
person
all
that
she
is
all
that
she
has
done
can
be
explained
directly
except
such
things
in
every
human
being
as
never
can
be
explained
she
does
not
it
would
seem
prove
the
existence
of
spirit
without
matter
or
of
innate
ideas
or
of
immortality
or
anything
else
that
any
other
human
being
does
not
prove
philosophers
have
tried
to
find
out
what
was
her
conception
of
abstract
ideas
before
she
learned
language
if
she
had
any
conception
there
is
no
way
of
discovering
it
now
for
she
can
not
remember
and
obviously
there
was
no
record
at
the
time
she
had
no
conception
of
god
before
she
heard
the
word
god
as
her
comments
very
clearly
show
her
sense
of
time
is
excellent
but
whether
it
would
have
developed
as
a
special
faculty
can
not
be
known
for
she
has
had
a
watch
since
she
was
seven
years
old
miss
keller
has
two
watches
which
have
been
given
her
they
are
i
think
the
only
ones
of
their
kind
in
america
the
watch
has
on
the
back
cover
a
flat
gold
indicator
which
can
be
pushed
freely
around
from
left
to
right
until
by
means
of
a
pin
inside
the
case
it
locks
with
the
hour
hand
and
takes
a
corresponding
position
the
point
of
this
gold
indicator
bends
over
the
edge
of
the
case
round
which
are
set
eleven
raised
points
the
stem
forms
the
twelfth
thus
the
watch
an
ordinary
watch
with
a
white
dial
for
the
person
who
sees
becomes
for
a
blind
person
by
this
special
attachment
in
effect
one
with
a
single
raised
hour
hand
and
raised
figures
though
there
is
less
than
half
an
inch
between
the
points
a
space
which
represents
sixty
minutes
miss
keller
tells
the
time
almost
exactly
it
should
be
said
that
any
watch
with
the
crystal
removed
serves
well
enough
for
a
blind
person
whose
touch
is
sufficiently
delicate
to
feel
the
position
of
the
hands
and
not
disturb
or
injure
them
the
finer
traits
of
miss
keller
character
are
so
well
known
that
one
needs
not
say
much
about
them
good
sense
good
humour
and
imagination
keep
her
scheme
of
things
sane
and
beautiful
no
attempt
is
made
by
those
around
her
either
to
preserve
or
to
break
her
illusions
when
she
was
a
little
girl
a
good
many
unwise
and
tactless
things
that
were
said
for
her
benefit
were
not
repeated
to
her
thanks
to
the
wise
watchfulness
of
miss
sullivan
now
that
she
has
grown
up
nobody
thinks
of
being
less
frank
with
her
than
with
any
other
intelligent
young
woman
what
her
good
friend
charles
dudley
warner
wrote
about
her
in
harper
magazine
in
was
true
then
and
it
remains
true
now
i
believe
she
is
the
human
ever
in
existence
the
world
to
her
is
what
her
own
mind
is
she
has
not
even
learned
that
exhibition
on
which
so
many
pride
themselves
of
indignation
some
time
ago
when
a
policeman
shot
dead
her
dog
a
dearly
loved
daily
companion
she
found
in
her
forgiving
heart
no
condemnation
for
the
man
she
only
said
he
had
only
known
what
a
good
dog
she
was
he
would
have
shot
her
it
was
said
of
old
time
forgive
them
they
know
not
what
they
do
of
course
the
question
will
arise
whether
if
helen
keller
had
not
been
guarded
from
the
knowledge
of
evil
she
would
have
been
what
she
is
her
mind
has
neither
been
made
effeminate
by
the
weak
and
silly
literature
nor
has
it
been
vitiated
by
that
which
is
suggestive
of
baseness
in
consequence
her
mind
is
not
only
vigorous
but
it
is
pure
she
is
in
love
with
noble
things
with
noble
thoughts
and
with
the
characters
of
noble
men
and
women
she
still
has
a
childlike
aversion
to
tragedies
her
imagination
is
so
vital
that
she
falls
completely
under
the
illusion
of
a
story
and
lives
in
its
world
miss
sullivan
writes
in
a
letter
of
yesterday
i
read
to
her
the
story
of
as
told
by
charles
and
mary
lamb
she
was
very
greatly
excited
by
it
and
said
is
terrible
it
makes
me
tremble
after
thinking
a
little
while
she
added
think
shakespeare
made
it
very
terrible
so
that
people
would
see
how
fearful
it
is
to
do
wrong
of
the
real
world
she
knows
more
of
the
good
and
less
of
the
evil
than
most
people
seem
to
know
her
teacher
does
not
harass
her
with
the
little
unhappy
things
but
of
the
important
difficulties
they
have
been
through
miss
keller
was
fully
informed
took
her
share
of
the
suffering
and
put
her
mind
to
the
problems
she
is
logical
and
tolerant
most
trustful
of
a
world
that
has
treated
her
kindly
once
when
some
one
asked
her
to
define
love
she
replied
why
bless
you
that
is
easy
it
is
what
everybody
feels
for
everybody
else
toleration
she
said
once
when
she
was
visiting
her
friend
laurence
hutton
is
the
greatest
gift
of
the
mind
it
requires
the
same
effort
of
the
brain
that
it
takes
to
balance
oneself
on
a
bicycle
she
has
a
large
generous
sympathy
and
absolute
fairness
of
temper
so
far
as
she
is
noticeably
different
from
other
people
she
is
less
bound
by
convention
she
has
the
courage
of
her
metaphors
and
lets
them
take
her
skyward
when
we
poor
folk
would
think
them
rather
too
bookish
for
ordinary
conversation
she
always
says
exactly
what
she
thinks
without
fear
of
the
plain
truth
yet
no
one
is
more
tactful
and
adroit
than
she
in
turning
an
unpleasant
truth
so
that
it
will
do
the
least
possible
hurt
to
the
feelings
of
others
not
all
the
attention
that
has
been
paid
her
since
she
was
a
child
has
made
her
take
herself
too
seriously
sometimes
she
gets
started
on
a
very
solemn
preachment
then
her
teacher
calls
her
an
incorrigible
little
sermonizer
and
she
laughs
at
herself
often
however
her
sober
ideas
are
not
to
be
laughed
at
for
her
earnestness
carries
her
listeners
with
her
there
is
never
the
least
false
sententiousness
in
what
she
says
she
means
everything
so
thoroughly
that
her
very
quotations
her
echoes
from
what
she
has
read
are
in
truth
original
her
logic
and
her
sympathy
are
in
excellent
balance
her
sympathy
is
of
the
swift
and
ministering
sort
which
fortunately
she
has
found
so
often
in
other
people
and
her
sympathies
go
further
and
shape
her
opinions
on
political
and
national
movements
she
was
intensely
and
wrote
a
strong
argument
in
favour
of
boer
independence
when
she
was
told
of
the
surrender
of
the
brave
little
people
her
face
clouded
and
she
was
silent
a
few
minutes
then
she
asked
clear
penetrating
questions
about
the
terms
of
the
surrender
and
began
to
discuss
them
both
gilman
and
keith
the
teachers
who
prepared
her
for
college
were
struck
by
her
power
of
constructive
reasoning
and
she
was
excellent
in
pure
mathematics
though
she
seems
never
to
have
enjoyed
it
much
some
of
the
best
of
her
writing
apart
from
her
fanciful
and
imaginative
work
is
her
exposition
in
examinations
and
technical
themes
and
in
some
letters
which
she
found
it
necessary
to
write
to
clear
up
misunderstandings
and
which
are
models
of
close
thinking
enforced
with
sweet
vehemence
she
is
an
optimist
and
an
idealist
i
hope
she
writes
in
a
letter
that
l
is
too
practical
for
if
she
is
i
afraid
she
miss
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
the
diary
that
she
kept
at
the
school
in
new
york
she
wrote
on
october
i
find
that
i
have
four
things
to
learn
in
my
school
life
here
and
indeed
in
life
to
think
clearly
without
hurry
or
confusion
to
love
everybody
sincerely
to
act
in
everything
with
the
highest
motives
and
to
trust
in
dear
god

education
it
is
now
years
since
samuel
gridley
howe
knew
that
he
had
made
his
way
through
laura
bridgman
fingers
to
her
intelligence
the
names
of
laura
bridgman
and
helen
keller
will
always
be
linked
together
and
it
is
necessary
to
understand
what
howe
did
for
his
pupil
before
one
comes
to
an
account
of
miss
sullivan
work
for
howe
is
the
great
pioneer
on
whose
work
that
of
miss
sullivan
and
other
teachers
of
the
immediately
depends
samuel
gridley
howe
was
born
in
boston
november
and
died
in
boston
january
he
was
a
great
philanthropist
interested
especially
in
the
education
of
all
defectives
the
the
blind
and
the
deaf
far
in
advance
of
his
time
he
advocated
many
public
measures
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
and
the
diseased
for
which
he
was
laughed
at
then
but
which
have
since
been
put
into
practice
as
head
of
the
perkins
institution
for
the
blind
in
boston
he
heard
of
laura
bridgman
and
had
her
brought
to
the
institution
on
october
laura
bridgman
was
born
at
hanover
new
hampshire
december
so
she
was
almost
eight
years
old
when
howe
began
his
experiments
with
her
at
the
age
of
months
scarlet
fever
left
her
without
sight
or
hearing
she
also
lost
her
sense
of
smell
and
taste
howe
was
an
experimental
scientist
and
had
in
him
the
spirit
of
new
england
transcendentalism
with
its
large
faith
and
large
charities
science
and
faith
together
led
him
to
try
to
make
his
way
into
the
soul
which
he
believed
was
born
in
laura
bridgman
as
in
every
other
human
being
his
plan
was
to
teach
laura
by
means
of
raised
types
he
pasted
raised
labels
on
objects
and
made
her
fit
the
labels
to
the
objects
and
the
objects
to
the
labels
when
she
had
learned
in
this
way
to
associate
raised
words
with
things
in
much
the
same
manner
he
says
as
a
dog
learns
tricks
he
began
to
resolve
the
words
into
their
letter
elements
and
to
teach
her
to
put
together
his
success
convinced
him
that
language
can
be
conveyed
through
type
to
the
mind
of
the
child
who
before
education
is
in
the
state
of
the
baby
who
has
not
learned
to
prattle
indeed
is
in
a
much
worse
state
for
the
brain
has
grown
in
years
without
natural
nourishment
after
laura
education
had
progressed
for
two
months
with
the
use
only
of
raised
letters
howe
sent
one
of
his
teachers
to
learn
the
manual
alphabet
from
a
she
taught
it
to
laura
and
from
that
time
on
the
manual
alphabet
was
the
means
of
communicating
with
her
after
the
first
year
or
two
howe
did
not
teach
laura
bridgman
himself
but
gave
her
over
to
other
teachers
who
under
his
direction
carried
on
the
work
of
teaching
her
language
too
much
can
not
be
said
in
praise
of
howe
work
as
an
investigator
he
kept
always
the
scientist
attitude
he
never
forgot
to
keep
his
records
of
laura
bridgman
in
the
fashion
of
one
who
works
in
a
laboratory
the
result
is
his
records
of
her
are
systematic
and
careful
from
a
scientific
standpoint
it
is
unfortunate
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
such
a
complete
record
of
helen
keller
development
this
in
itself
is
a
great
comment
on
the
difference
between
laura
bridgman
and
helen
keller
laura
always
remained
an
object
of
curious
study
helen
keller
became
so
rapidly
a
distinctive
personality
that
she
kept
her
teacher
in
a
breathless
race
to
meet
the
needs
of
her
pupil
with
no
time
or
strength
to
make
a
scientific
study
in
some
ways
this
is
unfortunate
miss
sullivan
knew
at
the
beginning
that
helen
keller
would
be
more
interesting
and
successful
than
laura
bridgman
and
she
expresses
in
one
of
her
letters
the
need
of
keeping
notes
but
neither
temperament
nor
training
allowed
her
to
make
her
pupil
the
object
of
any
experiment
or
observation
which
did
not
help
in
the
child
development
as
soon
as
a
thing
was
done
a
definite
goal
passed
the
teacher
did
not
always
look
back
and
describe
the
way
she
had
come
the
explanation
of
the
fact
was
unimportant
compared
to
the
fact
itself
and
the
need
of
hurrying
on
there
are
two
other
reasons
why
miss
sullivan
records
are
incomplete
it
has
always
been
a
severe
tax
on
her
eyes
to
write
and
she
was
early
discouraged
from
publishing
data
by
the
inaccurate
use
made
of
what
she
at
first
supplied
when
she
first
wrote
from
tuscumbia
to
michael
anagnos
howes
and
his
successor
as
director
of
the
perkins
institution
about
her
work
with
her
pupil
the
boston
papers
began
at
once
to
publish
exaggerated
accounts
of
helen
keller
miss
sullivan
protested
in
a
letter
dated
april
only
five
weeks
after
she
went
to
helen
keller
she
wrote
to
a
friend
sent
me
a
boston
herald
containing
a
stupid
article
about
helen
how
perfectly
absurd
to
say
that
helen
is
talking
fluently
why
one
might
just
as
well
say
that
a
child
converses
fluently
when
he
says
give
or
walk
go
i
suppose
if
you
included
his
screaming
crowing
whimpering
grunting
squalling
with
occasional
kicks
in
his
conversation
it
might
be
regarded
as
fluent
even
eloquent
then
it
is
amusing
to
read
of
the
elaborate
preparation
i
underwent
to
fit
me
for
the
great
task
my
friends
entrusted
to
me
i
am
sorry
that
preparation
did
include
spelling
it
would
have
saved
me
such
a
lot
of
trouble
on
march
she
writes
in
a
letter
indeed
i
am
heartily
glad
that
i
do
know
all
that
is
being
said
and
written
about
helen
and
myself
i
assure
you
i
know
quite
enough
nearly
every
mail
brings
some
absurd
statement
printed
or
written
the
truth
is
not
wonderful
enough
to
suit
the
newspapers
so
they
enlarge
upon
it
and
invent
ridiculous
embellishments
one
paper
has
helen
demonstrating
problems
in
geometry
by
means
of
her
playing
blocks
i
expect
to
hear
next
that
she
has
written
a
treatise
on
the
origin
and
future
of
the
planets
in
december
appeared
the
first
report
of
the
director
of
the
perkins
institution
which
deals
with
helen
keller
for
this
report
miss
sullivan
prepared
in
reluctant
compliance
with
the
request
of
anagnos
an
account
of
her
work
this
with
the
extracts
from
her
letters
scattered
through
the
report
is
the
first
valid
source
of
information
about
helen
keller
of
this
report
miss
sullivan
wrote
in
a
letter
dated
october
have
you
seen
the
paper
i
wrote
for
the
anagnos
was
delighted
with
it
he
says
helen
progress
has
been
triumphal
march
from
the
beginning
and
he
has
many
flattering
things
to
say
about
her
teacher
i
think
he
is
inclined
to
exaggerate
at
all
events
his
language
is
too
glowing
and
simple
facts
are
set
forth
in
such
a
manner
that
they
bewilder
one
doubtless
the
work
of
the
past
few
months
does
seem
like
a
triumphal
march
to
him
but
then
people
seldom
see
the
halting
and
painful
steps
by
which
the
most
insignificant
success
is
achieved
as
anagnos
was
the
head
of
a
great
institution
what
he
said
had
much
more
effect
than
the
facts
in
miss
sullivan
account
on
which
he
based
his
statements
the
newspapers
caught
anagnos
spirit
and
exaggerated
a
in
a
year
after
she
first
went
to
helen
keller
miss
sullivan
found
herself
and
her
pupil
the
centre
of
a
stupendous
fiction
then
the
educators
all
over
the
world
said
their
say
and
for
the
most
part
did
not
help
matters
there
grew
up
a
mass
of
controversial
matter
which
it
is
amusing
to
read
now
teachers
of
the
deaf
proved
a
priori
that
what
miss
sullivan
had
done
could
not
be
and
some
discredit
was
reflected
on
her
statements
because
they
were
surrounded
by
the
vague
eloquence
of
anagnos
thus
the
story
of
helen
keller
incredible
when
told
with
moderation
had
the
misfortune
to
be
heralded
by
exaggerated
announcements
and
naturally
met
either
an
ignorant
credulity
or
an
incredulous
hostility
in
november
another
report
of
the
perkins
institution
appeared
with
a
second
paper
by
miss
sullivan
and
then
nothing
official
was
published
until
november
when
anagnos
issued
the
last
perkins
institution
report
containing
anything
about
helen
keller
for
this
report
miss
sullivan
wrote
the
fullest
and
largest
account
she
has
ever
written
and
in
this
report
appeared
the
frost
king
which
is
discussed
fully
in
a
later
chapter
then
the
controversy
waxed
fiercer
than
ever
finding
that
other
people
seemed
to
know
so
much
more
about
helen
keller
than
she
did
miss
sullivan
kept
silent
and
has
been
silent
for
ten
years
except
for
her
paper
in
the
first
volta
bureau
souvenir
of
helen
keller
and
the
paper
which
at
bell
request
she
prepared
in
for
the
meeting
at
chautauqua
of
the
american
association
to
promote
the
teaching
of
speech
to
the
deaf
when
bell
and
others
tell
her
what
is
certainly
true
from
an
impersonal
point
of
view
that
she
owes
it
to
the
cause
of
education
to
write
what
she
knows
she
answers
very
properly
that
she
owes
all
her
time
and
all
her
energies
to
her
pupil
although
miss
sullivan
is
still
rather
amused
than
distressed
when
some
one
even
one
of
her
friends
makes
mistakes
in
published
articles
about
her
and
miss
keller
still
she
sees
that
miss
keller
book
should
include
all
the
information
that
the
teacher
could
at
present
furnish
so
she
consented
to
the
publication
of
extracts
from
letters
which
she
wrote
during
the
first
year
of
her
work
with
her
pupil
these
letters
were
written
to
sophia
hopkins
the
only
person
to
whom
miss
sullivan
ever
wrote
freely
hopkins
has
been
a
matron
at
the
perkins
institution
for
twenty
years
and
during
the
time
that
miss
sullivan
was
a
pupil
there
she
was
like
a
mother
to
her
in
these
letters
we
have
an
almost
weekly
record
of
miss
sullivan
work
some
of
the
details
she
had
forgotten
as
she
grew
more
and
more
to
generalize
many
people
have
thought
that
any
attempt
to
find
the
principles
in
her
method
would
be
nothing
but
a
later
theory
superimposed
on
miss
sullivan
work
but
it
is
evident
that
in
these
letters
she
was
making
a
clear
analysis
of
what
she
was
doing
she
was
her
own
critic
and
in
spite
of
her
later
declaration
made
with
her
modest
carelessness
that
she
followed
no
particular
method
she
was
very
clearly
learning
from
her
task
and
phrasing
at
the
time
principles
of
education
of
unique
value
not
only
in
the
teaching
of
the
deaf
but
in
the
teaching
of
all
children
the
extracts
from
her
letters
and
reports
form
an
important
contribution
to
pedagogy
and
more
than
justify
the
opinion
of
daniel
gilman
who
wrote
in
when
he
was
president
of
johns
hopkins
university
i
have
just
read
your
most
interesting
account
of
the
various
steps
you
have
taken
in
the
education
of
your
wonderful
pupil
and
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
express
my
admiration
for
the
wisdom
that
has
guided
your
methods
and
the
affection
which
has
inspired
your
labours
miss
anne
mansfield
sullivan
was
born
at
springfield
massachusetts
very
early
in
her
life
she
became
almost
totally
blind
and
she
entered
the
perkins
institution
october
when
she
was
fourteen
years
old
later
her
sight
was
partially
restored
anagnos
says
in
his
report
of
she
was
obliged
to
begin
her
education
at
the
lowest
and
most
elementary
point
but
she
showed
from
the
very
start
that
she
had
in
herself
the
force
and
capacity
which
insure
success
she
has
finally
reached
the
goal
for
which
she
strove
so
bravely
the
golden
words
that
howe
uttered
and
the
example
that
he
left
passed
into
her
thoughts
and
heart
and
helped
her
on
the
road
to
usefulness
and
now
she
stands
by
his
side
as
his
worthy
successor
in
one
of
the
most
cherished
branches
of
his
work
miss
talents
are
of
the
highest
order
in
she
graduated
from
the
perkins
institution
when
captain
keller
applied
to
the
director
for
a
teacher
anagnos
recommended
her
the
only
time
she
had
to
prepare
herself
for
the
work
with
her
pupil
was
from
august
when
captain
keller
wrote
to
february
during
this
time
she
read
howe
reports
she
was
further
aided
by
the
fact
that
during
the
six
years
of
her
school
life
she
had
lived
in
the
house
with
laura
bridgman
it
was
howe
who
by
his
work
with
laura
bridgman
made
miss
sullivan
work
possible
but
it
was
miss
sullivan
who
discovered
the
way
to
teach
language
to
the
it
must
be
remembered
that
miss
sullivan
had
to
solve
her
problems
unaided
by
previous
experience
or
the
assistance
of
any
other
teacher
during
the
first
year
of
her
work
with
helen
keller
in
which
she
taught
her
pupil
language
they
were
in
tuscumbia
and
when
they
came
north
and
visited
the
perkins
institution
helen
keller
was
never
a
regular
student
there
or
subject
to
the
discipline
of
the
institution
the
impression
that
miss
sullivan
educated
helen
keller
under
the
direction
of
anagnos
is
erroneous
in
the
three
years
during
which
at
various
times
miss
keller
and
miss
sullivan
were
guests
of
the
perkins
institution
the
teachers
there
did
not
help
miss
sullivan
and
anagnos
did
not
even
use
the
manual
alphabet
with
facility
as
a
means
of
communication
anagnos
wrote
in
the
report
of
the
perkins
institution
dated
november
at
my
urgent
request
helen
accompanied
by
her
mother
and
her
teacher
came
to
the
north
in
the
last
week
of
may
and
spent
several
months
with
us
as
our
guests
we
gladly
allowed
her
to
use
freely
our
library
of
embossed
books
our
collection
of
stuffed
animals
models
of
flowers
and
plants
and
the
rest
of
our
apparatus
for
instructing
the
blind
through
the
sense
of
touch
i
do
not
doubt
that
she
derived
from
them
much
pleasure
and
not
a
little
profit
but
whether
helen
stays
at
home
or
makes
visits
in
other
parts
of
the
country
her
education
is
always
under
the
immediate
direction
and
exclusive
control
of
her
teacher
no
one
interferes
with
miss
sullivan
plans
or
shares
in
her
tasks
she
has
been
allowed
entire
freedom
in
the
choice
of
means
and
methods
for
carrying
on
her
great
work
and
as
we
can
judge
by
the
results
she
has
made
a
most
judicious
and
discreet
use
of
this
privilege
what
the
little
pupil
has
thus
far
accomplished
is
widely
known
and
her
wonderful
attainments
command
general
admiration
but
only
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
particulars
of
the
grand
achievement
know
that
the
credit
is
largely
due
to
the
intelligence
wisdom
sagacity
unremitting
perseverance
and
unbending
will
of
the
instructress
who
rescued
the
child
from
the
depths
of
everlasting
night
and
stillness
and
watched
over
the
different
phases
of
her
mental
and
moral
development
with
maternal
solicitude
and
enthusiastic
devotion
here
follow
in
order
miss
sullivan
letters
and
the
most
important
passages
from
the
reports
i
have
omitted
from
each
succeeding
report
what
has
already
been
explained
and
does
not
need
to
be
repeated
for
the
ease
of
the
reader
i
have
with
miss
sullivan
consent
made
the
extracts
run
together
continuously
and
supplied
words
of
connection
and
the
resulting
necessary
changes
in
syntax
and
miss
sullivan
has
made
slight
changes
in
the
phrasing
of
her
reports
and
also
of
her
letters
which
were
carelessly
written
i
have
also
italicized
a
few
important
passages
some
of
her
opinions
miss
sullivan
would
like
to
enlarge
and
revise
that
remains
for
her
to
do
at
another
time
at
present
we
have
here
the
fullest
record
that
has
been
published
the
first
letter
is
dated
march
three
days
after
her
arrival
in
tuscumbia
it
was
when
i
reached
tuscumbia
i
found
keller
and
james
keller
waiting
for
me
they
said
somebody
had
met
every
train
for
two
days
the
drive
from
the
station
to
the
house
a
distance
of
one
mile
was
very
lovely
and
restful
i
was
surprised
to
find
keller
a
very
woman
not
much
older
than
myself
i
should
think
captain
keller
met
us
in
the
yard
and
gave
me
a
cheery
welcome
and
a
hearty
handshake
my
first
question
was
where
is
helen
i
tried
with
all
my
might
to
control
the
eagerness
that
made
me
tremble
so
that
i
could
hardly
walk
as
we
approached
the
house
i
saw
a
child
standing
in
the
doorway
and
captain
keller
said
there
she
is
she
has
known
all
day
that
some
one
was
expected
and
she
has
been
wild
ever
since
her
mother
went
to
the
station
for
you
i
had
scarcely
put
my
foot
on
the
steps
when
she
rushed
toward
me
with
such
force
that
she
would
have
thrown
me
backward
if
captain
keller
had
not
been
behind
me
she
felt
my
face
and
dress
and
my
bag
which
she
took
out
of
my
hand
and
tried
to
open
it
did
not
open
easily
and
she
felt
carefully
to
see
if
there
was
a
keyhole
finding
that
there
was
she
turned
to
me
making
the
sign
of
turning
a
key
and
pointing
to
the
bag
her
mother
interfered
at
this
point
and
showed
helen
by
signs
that
she
must
not
touch
the
bag
her
face
flushed
and
when
her
mother
attempted
to
take
the
bag
from
her
she
grew
very
angry
i
attracted
her
attention
by
showing
her
my
watch
and
letting
her
hold
it
in
her
hand
instantly
the
tempest
subsided
and
we
went
upstairs
together
here
i
opened
the
bag
and
she
went
through
it
eagerly
probably
expecting
to
find
something
to
eat
friends
had
probably
brought
her
candy
in
their
bags
and
she
expected
to
find
some
in
mine
i
made
her
understand
by
pointing
to
a
trunk
in
the
hall
and
to
myself
and
nodding
my
head
that
i
had
a
trunk
and
then
made
the
sign
that
she
had
used
for
eating
and
nodded
again
she
understood
in
a
flash
and
ran
downstairs
to
tell
her
mother
by
means
of
emphatic
signs
that
there
was
some
candy
in
a
trunk
for
her
she
returned
in
a
few
minutes
and
helped
me
put
away
my
things
it
was
too
comical
to
see
her
put
on
my
bonnet
and
cock
her
head
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
and
look
in
the
mirror
just
as
if
she
could
see
somehow
i
had
expected
to
see
a
pale
delicate
child
i
suppose
i
got
the
idea
from
description
of
laura
bridgman
when
she
came
to
the
institution
but
there
nothing
pale
or
delicate
about
helen
she
is
large
strong
and
ruddy
and
as
unrestrained
in
her
movements
as
a
young
colt
she
has
none
of
those
nervous
habits
that
are
so
noticeable
and
so
distressing
in
blind
children
her
body
is
well
formed
and
vigorous
and
keller
says
she
has
not
been
ill
a
day
since
the
illness
that
deprived
her
of
her
sight
and
hearing
she
has
a
fine
head
and
it
is
set
on
her
shoulders
just
right
her
face
is
hard
to
describe
it
is
intelligent
but
lacks
mobility
or
soul
or
something
her
mouth
is
large
and
finely
shaped
you
see
at
a
glance
that
she
is
blind
one
eye
is
larger
than
the
other
and
protrudes
noticeably
she
rarely
smiles
indeed
i
have
seen
her
smile
only
once
or
twice
since
i
came
she
is
unresponsive
and
even
impatient
of
caresses
from
any
one
except
her
mother
she
is
very
and
wilful
and
nobody
except
her
brother
james
has
attempted
to
control
her
the
greatest
problem
i
shall
have
to
solve
is
how
to
discipline
and
control
her
without
breaking
her
spirit
i
shall
go
rather
slowly
at
first
and
try
to
win
her
love
i
shall
not
attempt
to
conquer
her
by
force
alone
but
i
shall
insist
on
reasonable
obedience
from
the
start
one
thing
that
impresses
everybody
is
tireless
activity
she
is
never
still
a
moment
she
is
here
there
and
everywhere
her
hands
are
in
everything
but
nothing
holds
her
attention
for
long
dear
child
her
restless
spirit
gropes
in
the
dark
her
untaught
unsatisfied
hands
destroy
whatever
they
touch
because
they
do
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
things
she
helped
me
unpack
my
trunk
when
it
came
and
was
delighted
when
she
found
the
doll
the
little
girls
sent
her
i
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
teach
her
her
first
word
i
spelled
slowly
in
her
hand
and
pointed
to
the
doll
and
nodded
my
head
which
seems
to
be
her
sign
for
possession
whenever
anybody
gives
her
anything
she
points
to
it
then
to
herself
and
nods
her
head
she
looked
puzzled
and
felt
my
hand
and
i
repeated
the
letters
she
imitated
them
very
well
and
pointed
to
the
doll
then
i
took
the
doll
meaning
to
give
it
back
to
her
when
she
had
made
the
letters
but
she
thought
i
meant
to
take
it
from
her
and
in
an
instant
she
was
in
a
temper
and
tried
to
seize
the
doll
i
shook
my
head
and
tried
to
form
the
letters
with
her
fingers
but
she
got
more
and
more
angry
i
forced
her
into
a
chair
and
held
her
there
until
i
was
nearly
exhausted
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
useless
to
continue
the
struggle
i
must
do
something
to
turn
the
current
of
her
thoughts
i
let
her
go
but
refused
to
give
up
the
doll
i
went
downstairs
and
got
some
cake
she
is
very
fond
of
sweets
i
showed
helen
the
cake
and
spelled
in
her
hand
holding
the
cake
toward
her
of
course
she
wanted
it
and
tried
to
take
it
but
i
spelled
the
word
again
and
patted
her
hand
she
made
the
letters
rapidly
and
i
gave
her
the
cake
which
she
ate
in
a
great
hurry
thinking
i
suppose
that
i
might
take
it
from
her
then
i
showed
her
the
doll
and
spelled
the
word
again
holding
the
doll
toward
her
as
i
held
the
cake
she
made
the
letters
and
i
made
the
other
l
and
gave
her
the
doll
she
ran
downstairs
with
it
and
could
not
be
induced
to
return
to
my
room
all
day
yesterday
i
gave
her
a
to
do
i
made
the
first
row
of
vertical
lines
and
let
her
feel
it
and
notice
that
there
were
several
rows
of
little
holes
she
began
to
work
delightedly
and
finished
the
card
in
a
few
minutes
and
did
it
very
neatly
indeed
i
thought
i
would
try
another
word
so
i
spelled
she
made
the
then
stopped
and
thought
and
making
the
sign
for
eating
and
pointing
downward
she
pushed
me
toward
the
door
meaning
that
i
must
go
downstairs
for
some
cake
the
two
letters
you
see
had
reminded
her
of
fridays
lesson
not
that
she
had
any
idea
that
cake
was
the
name
of
the
thing
but
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
association
i
suppose
i
finished
the
word
and
obeyed
her
command
she
was
delighted
then
i
spelled
and
began
to
hunt
for
it
she
follows
with
her
hands
every
motion
you
make
and
she
knew
that
i
was
looking
for
the
doll
she
pointed
down
meaning
that
the
doll
was
downstairs
i
made
the
signs
that
she
had
used
when
she
wished
me
to
go
for
the
cake
and
pushed
her
toward
the
door
she
started
forward
then
hesitated
a
moment
evidently
debating
within
herself
whether
she
would
go
or
not
she
decided
to
send
me
instead
i
shook
my
head
and
spelled
more
emphatically
and
opened
the
door
for
her
but
she
obstinately
refused
to
obey
she
had
not
finished
the
cake
she
was
eating
and
i
took
it
away
indicating
that
if
she
brought
the
doll
i
would
give
her
back
the
cake
she
stood
perfectly
still
for
one
long
moment
her
face
crimson
then
her
desire
for
the
cake
triumphed
and
she
ran
downstairs
and
brought
the
doll
and
of
course
i
gave
her
the
cake
but
could
not
persuade
her
to
enter
the
room
again
she
was
very
troublesome
when
i
began
to
write
this
morning
she
kept
coming
up
behind
me
and
putting
her
hand
on
the
paper
and
into
the
these
blots
are
her
handiwork
finally
i
remembered
the
kindergarten
beads
and
set
her
to
work
stringing
them
first
i
put
on
two
wooden
beads
and
one
glass
bead
then
made
her
feel
of
the
string
and
the
two
boxes
of
beads
she
nodded
and
began
at
once
to
fill
the
string
with
wooden
beads
i
shook
my
head
and
took
them
all
off
and
made
her
feel
of
the
two
wooden
beads
and
the
one
glass
bead
she
examined
them
thoughtfully
and
began
again
this
time
she
put
on
the
glass
bead
first
and
the
two
wooden
ones
next
i
took
them
off
and
showed
her
that
the
two
wooden
ones
must
go
on
first
then
the
glass
bead
she
had
no
further
trouble
and
filled
the
string
quickly
too
quickly
in
fact
she
tied
the
ends
together
when
she
had
finished
the
string
and
put
the
beads
round
her
neck
i
did
not
make
the
knot
large
enough
in
the
next
string
and
the
beads
came
off
as
fast
as
she
put
them
on
but
she
solved
the
difficulty
herself
by
putting
the
string
through
a
bead
and
tying
it
i
thought
this
very
clever
she
amused
herself
with
the
beads
until
bringing
the
strings
to
me
now
and
then
for
my
approval
my
eyes
are
very
much
inflamed
i
know
this
letter
is
very
carelessly
written
i
had
a
lot
to
say
and
could
stop
to
think
how
to
express
things
neatly
please
do
not
show
my
letter
to
any
one
if
you
want
to
you
may
read
it
to
my
friends
monday
i
had
a
battle
royal
with
helen
this
morning
although
i
try
very
hard
not
to
force
issues
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
avoid
them
helen
table
manners
are
appalling
she
puts
her
hands
in
our
plates
and
helps
herself
and
when
the
dishes
are
passed
she
grabs
them
and
takes
out
whatever
she
wants
this
morning
i
would
not
let
her
put
her
hand
in
my
plate
she
persisted
and
a
contest
of
wills
followed
naturally
the
family
was
much
disturbed
and
left
the
room
i
locked
the
door
and
proceeded
to
eat
my
breakfast
though
the
food
almost
choked
me
helen
was
lying
on
the
floor
kicking
and
screaming
and
trying
to
pull
my
chair
from
under
me
she
kept
this
up
for
half
an
hour
then
she
got
up
to
see
what
i
was
doing
i
let
her
see
that
i
was
eating
but
did
not
let
her
put
her
hand
in
the
plate
she
pinched
me
and
i
slapped
her
every
time
she
did
it
then
she
went
all
round
the
table
to
see
who
was
there
and
finding
no
one
but
me
she
seemed
bewildered
after
a
few
minutes
she
came
back
to
her
place
and
began
to
eat
her
breakfast
with
her
fingers
i
gave
her
a
spoon
which
she
threw
on
the
floor
i
forced
her
out
of
the
chair
and
made
her
pick
it
up
finally
i
succeeded
in
getting
her
back
in
her
chair
again
and
held
the
spoon
in
her
hand
compelling
her
to
take
up
the
food
with
it
and
put
it
in
her
mouth
in
a
few
minutes
she
yielded
and
finished
her
breakfast
peaceably
then
we
had
another
tussle
over
folding
her
napkin
when
she
had
finished
she
threw
it
on
the
floor
and
ran
toward
the
door
finding
it
locked
she
began
to
kick
and
scream
all
over
again
it
was
another
hour
before
i
succeeded
in
getting
her
napkin
folded
then
i
let
her
out
into
the
warm
sunshine
and
went
up
to
my
room
and
threw
myself
on
the
bed
exhausted
i
had
a
good
cry
and
felt
better
i
suppose
i
shall
have
many
such
battles
with
the
little
woman
before
she
learns
the
only
two
essential
things
i
can
teach
her
obedience
and
love
dear
do
worry
i
do
my
best
and
leave
the
rest
to
whatever
power
manages
that
which
we
can
not
i
like
keller
very
much
tuscumbia
alabama
march
since
i
wrote
you
helen
and
i
have
gone
to
live
all
by
ourselves
in
a
little
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
her
home
only
a
short
distance
from
ivy
green
the
keller
homestead
i
very
soon
made
up
my
mind
that
i
could
do
nothing
with
helen
in
the
midst
of
the
family
who
have
always
allowed
her
to
do
exactly
as
she
pleased
she
has
tyrannized
over
everybody
her
mother
her
father
the
servants
the
little
darkies
who
play
with
her
and
nobody
had
ever
seriously
disputed
her
will
except
occasionally
her
brother
james
until
i
came
and
like
all
tyrants
she
holds
tenaciously
to
her
divine
right
to
do
as
she
pleases
if
she
ever
failed
to
get
what
she
wanted
it
was
because
of
her
inability
to
make
the
vassals
of
her
household
understand
what
it
was
every
thwarted
desire
was
the
signal
for
a
passionate
outburst
and
as
she
grew
older
and
stronger
these
tempests
became
more
violent
as
i
began
to
teach
her
i
was
beset
by
many
difficulties
she
would
yield
a
point
without
contesting
it
to
the
bitter
end
i
could
coax
her
or
compromise
with
her
to
get
her
to
do
the
simplest
thing
such
as
combing
her
hair
or
washing
her
hands
or
buttoning
her
boots
it
was
necessary
to
use
force
and
of
course
a
distressing
scene
followed
the
family
naturally
felt
inclined
to
interfere
especially
her
father
who
can
not
bear
to
see
her
cry
so
they
were
all
willing
to
give
in
for
the
sake
of
peace
besides
her
past
experiences
and
associations
were
all
against
me
i
saw
clearly
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
teach
her
language
or
anything
else
until
she
learned
to
obey
me
i
have
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
and
the
more
i
think
the
more
certain
i
am
that
obedience
is
the
gateway
through
which
knowledge
yes
and
love
too
enter
the
mind
of
the
child
as
i
wrote
you
i
meant
to
go
slowly
at
first
i
had
an
idea
that
i
could
win
the
love
and
confidence
of
my
little
pupil
by
the
same
means
that
i
should
use
if
she
could
see
and
hear
but
i
soon
found
that
i
was
cut
off
from
all
the
usual
approaches
to
the
child
heart
she
accepted
everything
i
did
for
her
as
a
matter
of
course
and
refused
to
be
caressed
and
there
was
no
way
of
appealing
to
her
affection
or
sympathy
or
childish
love
of
approbation
she
would
or
she
would
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
thus
it
is
we
study
plan
and
prepare
ourselves
for
a
task
and
when
the
hour
for
action
arrives
we
find
that
the
system
we
have
followed
with
such
labour
and
pride
does
not
fit
the
occasion
and
then
there
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
rely
on
something
within
us
some
innate
capacity
for
knowing
and
doing
which
we
did
not
know
we
possessed
until
the
hour
of
our
great
need
brought
it
to
light
i
had
a
good
frank
talk
with
keller
and
explained
to
her
how
difficult
it
was
going
to
be
to
do
anything
with
helen
under
the
existing
circumstances
i
told
her
that
in
my
opinion
the
child
ought
to
be
separated
from
the
family
for
a
few
weeks
at
least
that
she
must
learn
to
depend
on
and
obey
me
before
i
could
make
any
headway
after
a
long
time
keller
said
that
she
would
think
the
matter
over
and
see
what
captain
keller
thought
of
sending
helen
away
with
me
captain
keller
fell
in
with
the
scheme
most
readily
and
suggested
that
the
little
at
the
old
place
be
got
ready
for
us
he
said
that
helen
might
recognize
the
place
as
she
had
often
been
there
but
she
would
have
no
idea
of
her
surroundings
and
they
could
come
every
day
to
see
that
all
was
going
well
with
the
understanding
of
course
that
she
was
to
know
nothing
of
their
visits
i
hurried
the
preparations
for
our
departure
as
much
as
possible
and
here
we
are
the
little
house
is
a
genuine
bit
of
paradise
it
consists
of
one
large
square
room
with
a
great
fireplace
a
spacious
and
a
small
room
where
our
servant
a
little
negro
boy
sleeps
there
is
a
piazza
in
front
covered
with
vines
that
grow
so
luxuriantly
that
you
have
to
part
them
to
see
the
garden
beyond
our
meals
are
brought
from
the
house
and
we
usually
eat
on
the
piazza
the
little
negro
boy
takes
care
of
the
fire
when
we
need
one
so
i
can
give
my
whole
attention
to
helen
she
was
greatly
excited
at
first
and
kicked
and
screamed
herself
into
a
sort
of
stupor
but
when
supper
was
brought
she
ate
heartily
and
seemed
brighter
although
she
refused
to
let
me
touch
her
she
devoted
herself
to
her
dolls
the
first
evening
and
when
it
was
bedtime
she
undressed
very
quietly
but
when
she
felt
me
get
into
bed
with
her
she
jumped
out
on
the
other
side
and
nothing
that
i
could
do
would
induce
her
to
get
in
again
but
i
was
afraid
she
would
take
cold
and
i
insisted
that
she
must
go
to
bed
we
had
a
terrific
tussle
i
can
tell
you
the
struggle
lasted
for
nearly
two
hours
i
never
saw
such
strength
and
endurance
in
a
child
but
fortunately
for
us
both
i
am
a
little
stronger
and
quite
as
obstinate
when
i
set
out
i
finally
succeeded
in
getting
her
on
the
bed
and
covered
her
up
and
she
lay
curled
up
as
near
the
edge
of
the
bed
as
possible
the
next
morning
she
was
very
docile
but
evidently
homesick
she
kept
going
to
the
door
as
if
she
expected
some
one
and
every
now
and
then
she
would
touch
her
cheek
which
is
her
sign
for
her
mother
and
shake
her
head
sadly
she
played
with
her
dolls
more
than
usual
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
it
is
amusing
and
pathetic
to
see
helen
with
her
dolls
i
do
think
she
has
any
special
tenderness
for
them
i
have
never
seen
her
caress
them
but
she
dresses
and
undresses
them
many
times
during
the
day
and
handles
them
exactly
as
she
has
seen
her
mother
and
the
nurse
handle
her
baby
sister
this
morning
nancy
her
favourite
doll
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
about
swallowing
the
milk
that
was
being
administered
to
her
in
large
spoonfuls
for
helen
suddenly
put
down
the
cup
and
began
to
slap
her
on
the
back
and
turn
her
over
on
her
knees
trotting
her
gently
and
patting
her
softly
all
the
time
this
lasted
for
several
minutes
then
this
mood
passed
and
nancy
was
thrown
ruthlessly
on
the
floor
and
pushed
to
one
side
while
a
large
member
of
the
family
received
the
little
mother
undivided
attention
helen
knows
several
words
now
but
has
no
idea
how
to
use
them
or
that
everything
has
a
name
i
think
however
she
will
learn
quickly
enough
by
and
by
as
i
have
said
before
she
is
wonderfully
bright
and
active
and
as
quick
as
lightning
in
her
movements
march
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
my
experiment
is
working
out
finely
i
have
not
had
any
trouble
at
all
with
helen
either
yesterday
or
she
has
learned
three
new
words
and
when
i
give
her
the
objects
the
names
of
which
she
has
learned
she
spells
them
unhesitatingly
but
she
seems
glad
when
the
lesson
is
over
we
had
a
good
frolic
this
morning
out
in
the
garden
helen
evidently
knew
where
she
was
as
soon
as
she
touched
the
boxwood
hedges
and
made
many
signs
which
i
did
not
understand
no
doubt
they
were
signs
for
the
different
members
of
the
family
at
ivy
green
i
have
just
heard
something
that
surprised
me
very
much
it
seems
that
anagnos
had
heard
of
helen
before
he
received
captain
letter
last
summer
wilson
a
teacher
at
florence
and
a
friend
of
the
kellers
studied
at
harvard
the
summer
before
and
went
to
the
perkins
institution
to
learn
if
anything
could
be
done
for
his
child
he
saw
a
gentleman
whom
he
presumed
to
be
the
director
and
told
him
about
helen
he
says
the
gentleman
was
not
particularly
interested
but
said
he
would
see
if
anything
could
be
done
does
it
seem
strange
that
anagnos
never
referred
to
this
interview
march
my
heart
is
singing
for
joy
this
morning
a
miracle
has
happened
the
light
of
understanding
has
shone
upon
my
little
pupil
mind
and
behold
all
things
are
changed
the
wild
little
creature
of
two
weeks
ago
has
been
transformed
into
a
gentle
child
she
is
sitting
by
me
as
i
write
her
face
serene
and
happy
crocheting
a
long
red
chain
of
scotch
wool
she
learned
the
stitch
this
week
and
is
very
proud
of
the
achievement
when
she
succeeded
in
making
a
chain
that
would
reach
across
the
room
she
patted
herself
on
the
arm
and
put
the
first
work
of
her
hands
lovingly
against
her
cheek
she
lets
me
kiss
her
now
and
when
she
is
in
a
particularly
gentle
mood
she
will
sit
in
my
lap
for
a
minute
or
two
but
she
does
not
return
my
caresses
the
great
step
the
step
that
counts
has
been
taken
the
little
savage
has
learned
her
first
lesson
in
obedience
and
finds
the
yoke
easy
it
now
remains
my
pleasant
task
to
direct
and
mould
the
beautiful
intelligence
that
is
beginning
to
stir
in
the
already
people
remark
the
change
in
helen
her
father
looks
in
at
us
morning
and
evening
as
he
goes
to
and
from
his
office
and
sees
her
contentedly
stringing
her
beads
or
making
horizontal
lines
on
her
and
exclaims
how
quiet
she
is
when
i
came
her
movements
were
so
insistent
that
one
always
felt
there
was
something
unnatural
and
almost
weird
about
her
i
have
noticed
also
that
she
eats
much
less
a
fact
which
troubles
her
father
so
much
that
he
is
anxious
to
get
her
home
he
says
she
is
homesick
i
do
agree
with
him
but
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
leave
our
little
bower
very
soon
helen
has
learned
several
nouns
this
week
and
have
given
her
more
trouble
than
other
words
when
she
spells
milk
she
points
to
the
mug
and
when
she
spells
mug
she
makes
the
sign
for
pouring
or
drinking
which
shows
that
she
has
confused
the
words
she
has
no
idea
yet
that
everything
has
a
name
yesterday
i
had
the
little
negro
boy
come
in
when
helen
was
having
her
lesson
and
learn
the
letters
too
this
pleased
her
very
much
and
stimulated
her
ambition
to
excel
percy
she
was
delighted
if
he
made
a
mistake
and
made
him
form
the
letter
over
several
times
when
he
succeeded
in
forming
it
to
suit
her
she
patted
him
on
his
woolly
head
so
vigorously
that
i
thought
some
of
his
slips
were
intentional
one
day
this
week
captain
keller
brought
belle
a
setter
of
which
he
is
very
proud
to
see
us
he
wondered
if
helen
would
recognize
her
old
playmate
helen
was
giving
nancy
a
bath
and
did
notice
the
dog
at
first
she
usually
feels
the
softest
step
and
throws
out
her
arms
to
ascertain
if
any
one
is
near
her
belle
did
seem
very
anxious
to
attract
her
attention
i
imagine
she
has
been
rather
roughly
handled
sometimes
by
her
little
mistress
the
dog
had
been
in
the
room
more
than
half
a
minute
however
before
helen
began
to
sniff
and
dumped
the
doll
into
the
and
felt
about
the
room
she
stumbled
upon
belle
who
was
crouching
near
the
window
where
captain
keller
was
standing
it
was
evident
that
she
recognized
the
dog
for
she
put
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
squeezed
her
then
helen
sat
down
by
her
and
began
to
manipulate
her
claws
we
could
think
for
a
second
what
she
was
doing
but
when
we
saw
her
make
the
letters
on
her
own
fingers
we
knew
that
she
was
trying
to
teach
belle
to
spell
march
helen
and
i
came
home
yesterday
i
am
sorry
they
would
let
us
stay
another
week
but
i
think
i
have
made
the
most
i
could
of
the
opportunities
that
were
mine
the
past
two
weeks
and
i
do
expect
that
i
shall
have
any
serious
trouble
with
helen
in
the
future
the
back
of
the
greatest
obstacle
in
the
path
of
progress
is
broken
i
think
no
and
yes
conveyed
by
a
shake
or
a
nod
of
my
head
have
become
facts
as
apparent
to
her
as
hot
and
cold
or
as
the
difference
between
pain
and
pleasure
and
i
do
intend
that
the
lesson
she
has
learned
at
the
cost
of
so
much
pain
and
trouble
shall
be
unlearned
i
shall
stand
between
her
and
the
of
her
parents
i
have
told
captain
and
keller
that
they
must
not
interfere
with
me
in
any
way
i
have
done
my
best
to
make
them
see
the
terrible
injustice
to
helen
of
allowing
her
to
have
her
way
in
everything
and
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
processes
of
teaching
the
child
that
everything
can
not
be
as
he
wills
it
are
apt
to
be
painful
both
to
him
and
to
his
teacher
they
have
promised
to
let
me
have
a
free
hand
and
help
me
as
much
as
possible
the
improvement
they
can
not
help
seeing
in
their
child
has
given
them
more
confidence
in
me
of
course
it
is
hard
for
them
i
realize
that
it
hurts
to
see
their
afflicted
little
child
punished
and
made
to
do
things
against
her
will
only
a
few
hours
after
my
talk
with
captain
and
keller
and
they
had
agreed
to
everything
helen
took
a
notion
that
she
would
use
her
napkin
at
table
i
think
she
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
i
attempted
several
times
to
put
the
napkin
round
her
neck
but
each
time
she
tore
it
off
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
and
finally
began
to
kick
the
table
i
took
her
plate
away
and
started
to
take
her
out
of
the
room
her
father
objected
and
said
that
no
child
of
his
should
be
deprived
of
his
food
on
any
account
helen
did
come
up
to
my
room
after
supper
and
i
did
see
her
again
until
she
was
at
her
place
when
i
came
down
she
had
put
the
napkin
under
her
chin
instead
of
pinning
it
at
the
back
as
was
her
custom
she
called
my
attention
to
the
new
arrangement
and
when
i
did
not
object
she
seemed
pleased
and
patted
herself
when
she
left
the
she
took
my
hand
and
patted
it
i
wondered
if
she
was
trying
to
make
up
i
thought
i
would
try
the
effect
of
a
little
belated
discipline
i
went
back
to
the
and
got
a
napkin
when
helen
came
upstairs
for
her
lesson
i
arranged
the
objects
on
the
table
as
usual
except
that
the
cake
which
i
always
give
her
in
bits
as
a
reward
when
she
spells
a
word
quickly
and
correctly
was
not
there
she
noticed
this
at
once
and
made
the
sign
for
it
i
showed
her
the
napkin
and
pinned
it
round
her
neck
then
tore
it
off
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
and
shook
my
head
i
repeated
this
performance
several
times
i
think
she
understood
perfectly
well
for
she
slapped
her
hand
two
or
three
times
and
shook
her
head
we
began
the
lesson
as
usual
i
gave
her
an
object
and
she
spelled
the
name
she
knows
twelve
now
after
spelling
half
the
words
she
stopped
suddenly
as
if
a
thought
had
flashed
into
her
mind
and
felt
for
the
napkin
she
pinned
it
round
her
neck
and
made
the
sign
for
cake
it
did
occur
to
her
to
spell
the
word
you
see
i
took
this
for
a
promise
that
if
i
gave
her
some
cake
she
would
be
a
good
girl
i
gave
her
a
larger
piece
than
usual
and
she
chuckled
and
patted
herself
april
we
almost
live
in
the
garden
where
everything
is
growing
and
blooming
and
glowing
after
breakfast
we
go
out
and
watch
the
men
at
work
helen
loves
to
dig
and
play
in
the
dirt
like
any
other
child
this
morning
she
planted
her
doll
and
showed
me
that
she
expected
her
to
grow
as
tall
as
i
you
must
see
that
she
is
very
bright
but
you
have
no
idea
how
cunning
she
is
at
ten
we
come
in
and
string
beads
for
a
few
minutes
she
can
make
a
great
many
combinations
now
and
often
invents
new
ones
herself
then
i
let
her
decide
whether
she
will
sew
or
knit
or
crochet
she
learned
to
knit
very
quickly
and
is
making
a
for
her
mother
last
week
she
made
her
doll
an
apron
and
it
was
done
as
well
as
any
child
of
her
age
could
do
it
but
i
am
always
glad
when
this
work
is
over
for
the
day
sewing
and
crocheting
are
inventions
of
the
devil
i
think
rather
break
stones
on
the
king
highway
than
hem
a
handkerchief
at
eleven
we
have
gymnastics
she
knows
all
the
movements
and
the
anvil
chorus
with
the
her
father
says
he
is
going
to
fit
up
a
gymnasium
for
her
in
the
but
we
both
like
a
good
romp
better
than
set
exercises
the
hour
from
twelve
to
one
is
devoted
to
the
learning
of
new
words
but
you
must
think
this
is
the
only
time
i
spell
to
helen
for
i
spell
in
her
hand
everything
we
do
all
day
long
although
she
has
no
idea
as
yet
what
the
spelling
means
after
dinner
i
rest
for
an
hour
and
helen
plays
with
her
dolls
or
frolics
in
the
yard
with
the
little
darkies
who
were
her
constant
companions
before
i
came
later
i
join
them
and
we
make
the
rounds
of
the
outhouses
we
visit
the
horses
and
mules
in
their
stalls
and
hunt
for
eggs
and
feed
the
turkeys
often
when
the
weather
is
fine
we
drive
from
four
to
six
or
go
to
see
her
aunt
at
ivy
green
or
her
cousins
in
the
town
helen
instincts
are
decidedly
social
she
likes
to
have
people
about
her
and
to
visit
her
friends
partly
i
think
because
they
always
have
things
she
likes
to
eat
after
supper
we
go
to
my
room
and
do
all
sorts
of
things
until
eight
when
i
undress
the
little
woman
and
put
her
to
bed
she
sleeps
with
me
now
keller
wanted
to
get
a
nurse
for
her
but
i
concluded
i
rather
be
her
nurse
than
look
after
a
stupid
lazy
negress
besides
i
like
to
have
helen
depend
on
me
for
everything
and
i
find
it
much
easier
to
teach
her
things
at
odd
moments
than
at
set
times
on
march
i
found
that
helen
knew
eighteen
nouns
and
three
verbs
here
is
a
list
of
the
words
those
with
a
cross
after
them
are
words
she
asked
for
herself
doll
mug
pin
key
dog
hat
cup
box
water
milk
candy
eye
x
finger
x
toe
x
head
x
cake
baby
mother
sit
stand
walk
on
april
she
learned
the
nouns
knife
fork
spoon
saucer
tea
papa
bed
and
the
verb
run
april
i
must
write
you
a
line
this
morning
because
something
very
important
has
happened
helen
has
taken
the
second
great
step
in
her
education
she
has
learned
that
everything
has
a
name
and
that
the
manual
alphabet
is
the
key
to
everything
she
wants
to
know
in
a
previous
letter
i
think
i
wrote
you
that
mug
and
milk
had
given
helen
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
she
confused
the
nouns
with
the
verb
drink
she
did
know
the
word
for
drink
but
went
through
the
pantomime
of
drinking
whenever
she
spelled
mug
or
milk
this
morning
while
she
was
washing
she
wanted
to
know
the
name
for
water
when
she
wants
to
know
the
name
of
anything
she
points
to
it
and
pats
my
hand
i
spelled
and
thought
no
more
about
it
until
after
breakfast
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
with
the
help
of
this
new
word
i
might
succeed
in
straightening
out
the
difficulty
we
went
out
to
the
and
i
made
helen
hold
her
mug
under
the
spout
while
i
pumped
as
the
cold
water
gushed
forth
filling
the
mug
i
spelled
in
helen
free
hand
the
word
coming
so
close
upon
the
sensation
of
cold
water
rushing
over
her
hand
seemed
to
startle
her
she
dropped
the
mug
and
stood
as
one
transfixed
a
new
light
came
into
her
face
she
spelled
water
several
times
then
she
dropped
on
the
ground
and
asked
for
its
name
and
pointed
to
the
pump
and
the
trellis
and
suddenly
turning
round
she
asked
for
my
name
i
spelled
teacher
just
then
the
nurse
brought
helen
little
sister
into
the
and
helen
spelled
baby
and
pointed
to
the
nurse
all
the
way
back
to
the
house
she
was
highly
excited
and
learned
the
name
of
every
object
she
touched
so
that
in
a
few
hours
she
had
added
thirty
new
words
to
her
vocabulary
here
are
some
of
them
door
open
shut
give
go
come
and
a
great
many
more
i
did
finish
my
letter
in
time
to
get
it
posted
last
night
so
i
shall
add
a
line
helen
got
up
this
morning
like
a
radiant
fairy
she
has
flitted
from
object
to
object
asking
the
name
of
everything
and
kissing
me
for
very
gladness
last
night
when
i
got
in
bed
she
stole
into
my
arms
of
her
own
accord
and
kissed
me
for
the
first
time
and
i
thought
my
heart
would
burst
so
full
was
it
of
joy
april
i
see
an
improvement
in
helen
day
to
day
almost
from
hour
to
hour
everything
must
have
a
name
now
wherever
we
go
she
asks
eagerly
for
the
names
of
things
she
has
not
learned
at
home
she
is
anxious
for
her
friends
to
spell
and
eager
to
teach
the
letters
to
every
one
she
meets
she
drops
the
signs
and
pantomime
she
used
before
as
soon
as
she
has
words
to
supply
their
place
and
the
acquirement
of
a
new
word
affords
her
the
liveliest
pleasure
and
we
notice
that
her
face
grows
more
expressive
each
day
i
have
decided
not
to
try
to
have
regular
lessons
for
the
present
i
am
going
to
treat
helen
exactly
like
a
child
it
occurred
to
me
the
other
day
that
it
is
absurd
to
require
a
child
to
come
to
a
certain
place
at
a
certain
time
and
recite
certain
lessons
when
he
has
not
yet
acquired
a
working
vocabulary
i
sent
helen
away
and
sat
down
to
think
i
asked
myself
how
does
a
normal
child
learn
language
the
answer
was
simple
by
imitation
the
child
comes
into
the
world
with
the
ability
to
learn
and
he
learns
of
himself
provided
he
is
supplied
with
sufficient
outward
stimulus
he
sees
people
do
things
and
he
tries
to
do
them
he
hears
others
speak
and
he
tried
to
speak
but
long
before
he
utters
his
first
word
he
understands
what
is
said
to
him
i
have
been
observing
helen
little
cousin
lately
she
is
about
fifteen
months
old
and
already
understands
a
great
deal
in
response
to
questions
she
points
out
prettily
her
nose
mouth
eye
chin
cheek
ear
if
i
say
where
is
baby
other
ear
she
points
it
out
correctly
if
i
hand
her
a
flower
and
say
give
it
to
mamma
she
takes
it
to
her
mother
if
i
say
where
is
the
little
rogue
she
hides
behind
her
mother
chair
or
covers
her
face
with
her
hands
and
peeps
out
at
me
with
an
expression
of
genuine
roguishness
she
obeys
many
commands
like
these
come
kiss
go
to
papa
shut
the
door
give
me
the
biscuit
but
i
have
not
heard
her
try
to
say
any
of
these
words
although
they
have
been
repeated
hundreds
of
times
in
her
hearing
and
it
is
perfectly
evident
that
she
understands
them
these
observations
have
given
me
a
clue
to
the
method
to
be
followed
in
teaching
helen
shall
talk
into
her
hand
as
we
talk
into
the
baby
ears
i
shall
assume
that
she
has
the
normal
child
capacity
of
assimilation
and
imitation
i
shall
use
complete
sentences
in
talking
to
her
and
fill
out
the
meaning
with
gestures
and
her
descriptive
signs
when
necessity
requires
it
but
i
shall
not
try
to
keep
her
mind
fixed
on
any
one
thing
i
shall
do
all
i
can
to
interest
and
stimulate
it
and
wait
for
results
april
the
new
scheme
works
splendidly
helen
knows
the
meaning
of
more
than
a
hundred
words
now
and
learns
new
ones
daily
without
the
slightest
suspicion
that
she
is
performing
a
most
difficult
feat
she
learns
because
she
ca
help
it
just
as
the
bird
learns
to
fly
but
imagine
that
she
talks
fluently
like
her
baby
cousin
she
expresses
whole
sentences
by
single
words
milk
with
a
gesture
means
give
me
more
milk
mother
accompanied
by
an
inquiring
look
means
were
is
mother
go
means
i
want
to
go
out
but
when
i
spell
into
her
hand
give
me
some
bread
she
hands
me
the
bread
or
if
i
say
get
your
hat
and
we
will
go
to
walk
she
obeys
instantly
the
two
words
hat
and
walk
would
have
the
same
effect
but
the
whole
sentence
repeated
many
times
during
the
day
must
in
time
impress
itself
upon
the
brain
and
by
and
by
she
will
use
it
herself
we
play
a
little
game
which
i
find
most
useful
in
developing
the
intellect
and
which
incidentally
answers
the
purpose
of
a
language
lesson
it
is
an
adaptation
of
i
hide
something
a
ball
or
a
spool
and
we
hunt
for
it
when
we
first
played
this
game
two
or
three
days
ago
she
showed
no
ingenuity
at
all
in
finding
the
object
she
looked
in
places
where
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
put
the
ball
or
the
spool
for
instance
when
i
hid
the
ball
she
looked
under
her
again
when
i
hid
the
spool
she
looked
for
it
in
a
little
box
not
more
than
an
inch
long
and
she
very
soon
gave
up
the
search
now
i
can
keep
up
her
interest
in
the
game
for
an
hour
or
longer
and
she
shows
much
more
intelligence
and
often
great
ingenuity
in
the
search
this
morning
i
hid
a
cracker
she
looked
everywhere
she
could
think
of
without
success
and
was
evidently
in
despair
when
suddenly
a
thought
struck
her
and
she
came
running
to
me
and
made
me
open
my
mouth
very
wide
while
she
gave
it
a
thorough
investigation
finding
no
trace
of
the
cracker
there
she
pointed
to
my
stomach
and
spelled
eat
meaning
did
you
eat
it
friday
we
went
down
town
and
met
a
gentleman
who
gave
helen
some
candy
which
she
ate
except
one
small
piece
which
she
put
in
her
apron
pocket
when
we
reached
home
she
found
her
mother
and
of
her
own
accord
said
give
baby
candy
keller
spelled
no
baby
eat
no
helen
went
to
the
cradle
and
felt
of
mildred
mouth
and
pointed
to
her
own
teeth
keller
spelled
teeth
helen
shook
her
head
and
spelled
baby
teeth
no
baby
eat
no
meaning
of
course
baby
can
not
eat
because
she
has
no
teeth
may
no
i
do
want
any
more
kindergarten
materials
i
used
my
little
stock
of
beads
cards
and
straws
at
first
because
i
did
know
what
else
to
do
but
the
need
for
them
is
past
for
the
present
at
any
rate
i
am
beginning
to
suspect
all
elaborate
and
special
systems
of
education
they
seem
to
me
to
be
built
up
on
the
supposition
that
every
child
is
a
kind
of
idiot
who
must
be
taught
to
think
whereas
if
the
child
is
left
to
himself
he
will
think
more
and
better
if
less
showily
let
him
go
and
come
freely
let
him
touch
real
things
and
combine
his
impressions
for
himself
instead
of
sitting
indoors
at
a
little
round
table
while
a
teacher
suggests
that
he
build
a
stone
wall
with
his
wooden
blocks
or
make
a
rainbow
out
of
strips
of
coloured
paper
or
plant
straw
trees
in
bead
such
teaching
fills
the
mind
with
artificial
associations
that
must
be
got
rid
of
before
the
child
can
develop
independent
ideas
out
of
actual
experiences
helen
is
learning
adjectives
and
adverbs
as
easily
as
she
learned
nouns
the
idea
always
precedes
the
word
she
had
signs
for
small
and
large
long
before
i
came
to
her
if
she
wanted
a
small
object
and
was
given
a
large
one
she
would
shake
her
head
and
take
up
a
tiny
bit
of
the
skin
of
one
hand
between
the
thumb
and
finger
of
the
other
if
she
wanted
to
indicate
something
large
she
spread
the
fingers
of
both
hands
as
wide
as
she
could
and
brought
them
together
as
if
to
clasp
a
big
ball
the
other
day
i
substituted
the
words
small
and
large
for
these
signs
and
she
at
once
adopted
the
words
and
discarded
the
signs
i
can
now
tell
her
to
bring
me
a
large
book
or
a
small
plate
to
go
upstairs
slowly
to
run
fast
and
to
walk
quickly
this
morning
she
used
the
conjunction
and
for
the
first
time
i
told
her
to
shut
the
door
and
she
added
and
lock
she
came
tearing
upstairs
a
few
minutes
ago
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
i
could
make
out
at
first
what
it
was
all
about
she
kept
spelling
dog
baby
and
pointing
to
her
five
fingers
one
after
another
and
sucking
them
my
first
thought
was
one
of
the
dogs
has
hurt
mildred
but
helen
beaming
face
set
my
fears
at
rest
nothing
would
do
but
i
must
go
somewhere
with
her
to
see
something
she
led
the
way
to
the
and
there
in
the
corner
was
one
of
the
setters
with
five
dear
little
pups
i
taught
her
the
word
puppy
and
drew
her
hand
over
them
all
while
they
sucked
and
spelled
puppies
she
was
much
interested
in
the
feeding
process
and
spelled
and
baby
several
times
helen
noticed
that
the
puppies
eyes
were
closed
and
she
said
eyes
shut
sleep
no
meaning
the
eyes
are
shut
but
the
puppies
are
not
asleep
she
screamed
with
glee
when
the
little
things
squealed
and
squirmed
in
their
efforts
to
get
back
to
their
mother
and
spelled
baby
eat
large
i
suppose
her
idea
was
baby
eats
much
she
pointed
to
each
puppy
one
after
another
and
to
her
five
fingers
and
i
taught
her
the
word
five
then
she
held
up
one
finger
and
said
baby
i
knew
she
was
thinking
of
mildred
and
i
spelled
one
baby
and
five
puppies
after
she
had
played
with
them
a
little
while
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
the
puppies
must
have
special
names
like
people
and
she
asked
for
the
name
of
each
pup
i
told
her
to
ask
her
father
and
she
said
no
mother
she
evidently
thought
mothers
were
more
likely
to
know
about
babies
of
all
sorts
she
noticed
that
one
of
the
puppies
was
much
smaller
than
the
others
and
she
spelled
small
making
the
sign
at
the
same
time
and
i
said
very
small
she
evidently
understood
that
very
was
the
name
of
the
new
thing
that
had
come
into
her
head
for
all
the
way
back
to
the
house
she
used
the
word
very
correctly
one
stone
was
small
another
was
very
small
when
she
touched
her
little
sister
she
said
baby
small
puppy
very
small
soon
after
she
began
to
vary
her
steps
from
large
to
small
and
little
mincing
steps
were
very
small
she
is
going
through
the
house
now
applying
the
new
words
to
all
kinds
of
objects
since
i
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
regular
lessons
i
find
that
helen
learns
much
faster
i
am
convinced
that
the
time
spent
by
the
teacher
in
digging
out
of
the
child
what
she
has
put
into
him
for
the
sake
of
satisfying
herself
that
it
has
taken
root
is
so
much
time
thrown
away
it
much
better
i
think
to
assume
that
the
child
is
doing
his
part
and
that
the
seed
you
have
sown
will
bear
fruit
in
due
time
it
only
fair
to
the
child
anyhow
and
it
saves
you
much
unnecessary
trouble
may
we
have
begun
to
take
long
walks
every
morning
immediately
after
breakfast
the
weather
is
fine
and
the
air
is
full
of
the
scent
of
strawberries
our
objective
point
is
keller
landing
on
the
tennessee
about
two
miles
distant
we
never
know
how
we
get
there
or
where
we
are
at
a
given
moment
but
that
only
adds
to
our
enjoyment
especially
when
everything
is
new
and
strange
indeed
i
feel
as
if
i
had
never
seen
anything
until
now
helen
finds
so
much
to
ask
about
along
the
way
we
chase
butterflies
and
sometimes
catch
one
then
we
sit
down
under
a
tree
or
in
the
shade
of
a
bush
and
talk
about
it
afterwards
if
it
has
survived
the
lesson
we
let
it
go
but
usually
its
life
and
beauty
are
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
learning
though
in
another
sense
it
lives
forever
for
has
it
not
been
transformed
into
living
thoughts
it
is
wonderful
how
words
generate
ideas
every
new
word
helen
learns
seems
to
carry
with
it
necessity
for
many
more
her
mind
grows
through
its
ceaseless
activity
keller
landing
was
used
during
the
war
to
land
troops
but
has
long
since
gone
to
pieces
and
is
overgrown
with
moss
and
weeds
the
solitude
of
the
place
sets
one
dreaming
near
the
landing
there
is
a
beautiful
little
spring
which
helen
calls
because
i
told
her
the
squirrels
came
there
to
drink
she
has
felt
dead
squirrels
and
rabbits
and
other
wild
animals
and
is
anxious
to
see
a
which
interpreted
means
i
think
a
live
squirrel
we
go
home
about
usually
and
helen
is
eager
to
tell
her
mother
everything
she
has
seen
this
desire
to
repeat
what
has
been
told
her
shows
a
marked
advance
in
the
development
of
her
intellect
and
is
an
invaluable
stimulus
to
the
acquisition
of
language
i
ask
all
her
friends
to
encourage
her
to
tell
them
of
her
doings
and
to
manifest
as
much
curiosity
and
pleasure
in
her
little
adventures
as
they
possibly
can
this
gratifies
the
child
love
of
approbation
and
keeps
up
her
interest
in
things
this
is
the
basis
of
real
intercourse
she
makes
many
mistakes
of
course
twists
words
and
phrases
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse
and
gets
herself
into
hopeless
tangles
of
nouns
and
verbs
but
so
does
the
hearing
child
i
am
sure
these
difficulties
will
take
care
of
themselves
the
impulse
to
tell
is
the
important
thing
i
supply
a
word
here
and
there
sometimes
a
sentence
and
suggest
something
which
she
has
omitted
or
forgotten
thus
her
vocabulary
grows
apace
and
the
new
words
germinate
and
bring
forth
new
ideas
and
they
are
the
stuff
out
of
which
heaven
and
earth
are
made
may
my
work
grows
more
absorbing
and
interesting
every
day
helen
is
a
wonderful
child
so
spontaneous
and
eager
to
learn
she
knows
about
words
now
and
a
great
many
common
idioms
and
it
is
not
three
months
yet
since
she
learned
her
first
word
it
is
a
rare
privilege
to
watch
the
birth
growth
and
first
feeble
struggles
of
a
living
mind
this
privilege
is
mine
and
moreover
it
is
given
me
to
rouse
and
guide
this
bright
intelligence
if
only
i
were
better
fitted
for
the
great
task
i
feel
every
day
more
and
more
inadequate
my
mind
is
full
of
ideas
but
i
can
not
get
them
into
working
shape
you
see
my
mind
is
undisciplined
full
of
skips
and
jumps
and
here
and
there
a
lot
of
things
huddled
together
in
dark
corners
how
i
long
to
put
it
in
order
oh
if
only
there
were
some
one
to
help
me
i
need
a
teacher
quite
as
much
as
helen
i
know
that
the
education
of
this
child
will
be
the
distinguishing
event
of
my
life
if
i
have
the
brains
and
perseverance
to
accomplish
it
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
one
thing
helen
must
learn
to
use
books
indeed
we
must
both
learn
to
use
them
and
that
reminds
me
will
you
please
ask
anagnos
to
get
me
perez
and
sully
psychologies
i
think
i
shall
find
them
helpful
we
have
reading
lessons
every
day
usually
we
take
one
of
the
little
readers
up
in
a
big
tree
near
the
house
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
finding
the
words
helen
already
knows
we
make
a
sort
of
game
of
it
and
try
to
see
who
can
find
the
words
most
quickly
helen
with
her
fingers
or
i
with
my
eyes
and
she
learns
as
many
new
words
as
i
can
explain
with
the
help
of
those
she
knows
when
her
fingers
light
upon
words
she
knows
she
fairly
screams
with
pleasure
and
hugs
and
kisses
me
for
joy
especially
if
she
thinks
she
has
me
beaten
it
would
astonish
you
to
see
how
many
words
she
learns
in
an
hour
in
this
pleasant
manner
afterward
i
put
the
new
words
into
little
sentences
in
the
frame
and
sometimes
it
is
possible
to
tell
a
little
story
about
a
bee
or
a
cat
or
a
little
boy
in
this
way
i
can
now
tell
her
to
go
upstairs
or
down
out
of
doors
or
into
the
house
lock
or
unlock
a
door
take
or
bring
objects
sit
stand
walk
run
lie
creep
roll
or
climb
she
is
delighted
with
so
it
is
no
trouble
at
all
to
teach
her
verbs
she
is
always
ready
for
a
lesson
and
the
eagerness
with
which
she
absorbs
ideas
is
very
delightful
she
is
as
triumphant
over
the
conquest
of
a
sentence
as
a
general
who
has
captured
the
enemy
stronghold
one
of
helen
old
habits
that
is
strongest
and
hardest
to
correct
is
a
tendency
to
break
things
if
she
finds
anything
in
her
way
she
flings
it
on
the
floor
no
matter
what
it
is
a
glass
a
pitcher
or
even
a
lamp
she
has
a
great
many
dolls
and
every
one
of
them
has
been
broken
in
a
fit
of
temper
or
ennui
the
other
day
a
friend
brought
her
a
new
doll
from
memphis
and
i
thought
i
would
see
if
i
could
make
helen
understand
that
she
must
not
break
it
i
made
her
go
through
the
motion
of
knocking
the
doll
head
on
the
table
and
spelled
to
her
no
no
helen
is
naughty
teacher
is
sad
and
let
her
feel
the
grieved
expression
on
my
face
then
i
made
her
caress
the
doll
and
kiss
the
hurt
spot
and
hold
it
gently
in
her
arms
and
i
spelled
to
her
good
helen
teacher
is
happy
and
let
her
feel
the
smile
on
my
face
she
went
through
these
motions
several
times
mimicking
every
movement
then
she
stood
very
still
for
a
moment
with
a
troubled
look
on
her
face
which
suddenly
cleared
and
she
spelled
good
helen
and
wreathed
her
face
in
a
very
large
artificial
smile
then
she
carried
the
doll
upstairs
and
put
it
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
wardrobe
and
she
has
not
touched
it
since
please
give
my
kind
regards
to
anagnos
and
let
him
see
my
letter
if
you
think
best
i
hear
there
is
a
deaf
and
blind
child
being
educated
at
the
baltimore
institution
june
the
weather
is
scorching
we
need
rain
badly
we
are
all
troubled
about
helen
she
is
very
nervous
and
excitable
she
is
restless
at
night
and
has
no
appetite
it
is
hard
to
know
what
to
do
with
her
the
doctor
says
her
mind
is
too
active
but
how
are
we
to
keep
her
from
thinking
she
begins
to
spell
the
minute
she
wakes
up
in
the
morning
and
continues
all
day
long
if
i
refuse
to
talk
to
her
she
spells
into
her
own
hand
and
apparently
carries
on
the
liveliest
conversation
with
herself
i
gave
her
my
braille
slate
to
play
with
thinking
that
the
mechanical
pricking
of
holes
in
the
paper
would
amuse
her
and
rest
her
mind
but
what
was
my
astonishment
when
i
found
that
the
little
witch
was
writing
letters
i
had
no
idea
she
knew
what
a
letter
was
she
has
often
gone
with
me
to
the
to
mail
letters
and
i
suppose
i
have
repeated
to
her
things
i
wrote
to
you
she
knew
too
that
i
sometimes
write
letters
to
blind
girls
on
the
slate
but
i
did
suppose
that
she
had
any
clear
idea
what
a
letter
was
one
day
she
brought
me
a
sheet
that
she
had
punched
full
of
holes
and
wanted
to
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
take
it
to
the
she
said
frank
letter
i
asked
her
what
she
had
written
to
frank
she
replied
much
words
puppy
motherdog
five
baby
cry
hot
helen
walk
no
sunfire
bad
frank
come
helen
kiss
frank
strawberries
very
good
helen
is
almost
as
eager
to
read
as
she
is
to
talk
i
find
she
grasps
the
import
of
whole
sentences
catching
from
the
context
the
meaning
of
words
she
does
know
and
her
eager
questions
indicate
the
outward
reaching
of
her
mind
and
its
unusual
powers
the
other
night
when
i
went
to
bed
i
found
helen
sound
asleep
with
a
big
book
clasped
tightly
in
her
arms
she
had
evidently
been
reading
and
fallen
asleep
when
i
asked
her
about
it
in
the
morning
she
said
book
cry
and
completed
her
meaning
by
shaking
and
other
signs
of
fear
i
taught
her
the
word
afraid
and
she
said
helen
is
not
afraid
book
is
afraid
book
will
sleep
with
girl
i
told
her
that
the
book
was
afraid
and
must
sleep
in
its
case
and
that
girl
must
read
in
bed
she
looked
very
roguish
and
apparently
understood
that
i
saw
through
her
ruse
i
am
glad
anagnos
thinks
so
highly
of
me
as
a
teacher
but
genius
and
originality
are
words
we
should
not
use
lightly
if
indeed
they
apply
to
me
even
remotely
i
do
not
see
that
i
deserve
any
laudation
on
that
account
and
right
here
i
want
to
say
something
which
is
for
your
ears
alone
something
within
me
tells
me
that
i
shall
succeed
beyond
my
dreams
were
it
not
for
some
circumstances
that
make
such
an
idea
highly
improbable
even
absurd
i
should
think
helen
education
would
surpass
in
interest
and
wonder
howe
achievement
i
know
that
she
has
remarkable
powers
and
i
believe
that
i
shall
be
able
to
develop
and
mould
them
i
can
not
tell
how
i
know
these
things
i
had
no
idea
a
short
time
ago
how
to
go
to
work
i
was
feeling
about
in
the
dark
but
somehow
i
know
now
and
i
know
that
i
know
i
can
not
explain
it
but
when
difficulties
arise
i
am
not
perplexed
or
doubtful
i
know
how
to
meet
them
i
seem
to
divine
helen
peculiar
needs
it
is
wonderful
already
people
are
taking
a
deep
interest
in
helen
no
one
can
see
her
without
being
impressed
she
is
no
ordinary
child
and
people
interest
in
her
education
will
be
no
ordinary
interest
therefore
let
us
be
exceedingly
careful
what
we
say
and
write
about
her
i
shall
write
freely
to
you
and
tell
you
everything
on
one
condition
it
is
this
you
must
promise
never
to
show
my
letters
to
any
one
my
beautiful
helen
shall
not
be
transformed
into
a
prodigy
if
i
can
help
it
june
the
heat
makes
helen
languid
and
quiet
indeed
the
tophetic
weather
has
reduced
us
all
to
a
state
yesterday
helen
took
off
her
clothes
and
sat
in
her
skin
all
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
got
round
to
the
window
where
she
was
sitting
with
her
book
she
got
up
impatiently
and
shut
the
window
but
when
the
sun
came
in
just
the
same
she
came
over
to
me
with
a
grieved
look
and
spelled
emphatically
sun
is
bad
boy
sun
must
go
to
bed
she
is
the
dearest
cutest
little
thing
now
and
so
loving
one
day
when
i
wanted
her
to
bring
me
some
water
she
said
legs
very
tired
legs
cry
much
she
is
much
interested
in
some
little
chickens
that
are
pecking
their
way
into
the
world
this
morning
i
let
her
hold
a
shell
in
her
hand
and
feel
the
chicken
chip
chip
her
astonishment
when
she
felt
the
tiny
creature
inside
can
not
be
put
in
a
letter
the
hen
was
very
gentle
and
made
no
objection
to
our
investigations
besides
the
chickens
we
have
several
other
additions
to
the
family
two
calves
a
colt
and
a
penful
of
funny
little
pigs
you
would
be
amused
to
see
me
hold
a
squealing
pig
in
my
arms
while
helen
feels
it
all
over
and
asks
countless
questions
questions
not
easy
to
answer
either
after
seeing
the
chicken
come
out
of
the
egg
she
asked
did
baby
pig
grow
in
egg
where
are
many
shells
helen
head
measures
twenty
and
inches
and
mine
measures
and
inches
you
see
i
only
one
inch
ahead
june
the
weather
continues
hot
helen
is
about
the
same
pale
and
thin
but
you
must
think
she
is
really
ill
i
am
sure
the
heat
and
not
the
natural
beautiful
activity
of
her
mind
is
responsible
for
her
condition
of
course
i
shall
not
overtax
her
brain
we
are
bothered
a
good
deal
by
people
who
assume
the
responsibility
of
the
world
when
god
is
neglectful
they
tell
us
that
helen
is
overdoing
that
her
mind
is
too
active
these
very
people
thought
she
had
no
mind
at
all
a
few
months
ago
and
suggest
many
absurd
and
impossible
remedies
but
so
far
nobody
seems
to
have
thought
of
chloroforming
her
which
is
i
think
the
only
effective
way
of
stopping
the
natural
exercise
of
her
faculties
it
queer
how
ready
people
always
are
with
advice
in
any
real
or
imaginary
emergency
and
no
matter
how
many
times
experience
has
shown
them
to
be
wrong
they
continue
to
set
forth
their
opinions
as
if
they
had
received
them
from
the
almighty
i
am
teaching
helen
the
letters
as
a
sort
of
diversion
it
gives
her
something
to
do
and
keeps
her
quiet
which
i
think
is
desirable
while
this
enervating
weather
lasts
she
has
a
perfect
mania
for
counting
she
has
counted
everything
in
the
house
and
is
now
busy
counting
the
words
in
her
primer
i
hope
it
will
not
occur
to
her
to
count
the
hairs
of
her
head
if
she
could
see
and
hear
i
suppose
she
would
get
rid
of
her
superfluous
energy
in
ways
which
would
not
perhaps
tax
her
brain
so
much
although
i
suspect
that
the
ordinary
child
takes
his
play
pretty
seriously
the
little
fellow
who
whirls
his
new
york
flyer
round
the
nursery
making
horseshoe
curves
undreamed
of
by
less
imaginative
engineers
is
concentrating
his
whole
soul
on
his
toy
locomotive
she
just
came
to
say
with
a
worried
expression
girl
not
count
very
large
many
words
i
said
no
go
and
play
with
nancy
this
suggestion
did
please
her
however
for
she
replied
no
nancy
is
very
sick
i
asked
what
was
the
matter
and
she
said
much
many
teeth
do
make
nancy
sick
mildred
is
teething
i
happened
to
tell
her
the
other
day
that
the
vine
on
the
fence
was
a
creeper
she
was
greatly
amused
and
began
at
once
to
find
analogies
between
her
movements
and
those
of
the
plants
they
run
creep
hop
and
skip
bend
fall
climb
and
swing
but
she
tells
me
roguishly
that
she
is
helen
held
some
worsted
for
me
last
night
while
i
wound
it
afterward
she
began
to
swing
round
and
round
spelling
to
herself
all
the
time
wind
fast
wind
slow
and
apparently
enjoying
her
conceit
very
much
june
we
had
a
glorious
last
night
and
it
much
cooler
we
all
feel
refreshed
as
if
we
had
a
helen
as
lively
as
a
cricket
she
wanted
to
know
if
men
were
shooting
in
the
sky
when
she
felt
the
thunder
and
if
the
trees
and
flowers
drank
all
the
rain
june
my
little
pupil
continues
to
manifest
the
same
eagerness
to
learn
as
at
first
her
every
waking
moment
is
spent
in
the
endeavour
to
satisfy
her
innate
desire
for
knowledge
and
her
mind
works
so
incessantly
that
we
have
feared
for
her
health
but
her
appetite
which
left
her
a
few
weeks
ago
has
returned
and
her
sleep
seems
more
quiet
and
natural
she
will
be
seven
years
old
the
of
this
month
her
height
is
four
feet
one
inch
and
her
head
measures
twenty
and
inches
in
circumference
the
line
being
drawn
round
the
head
so
as
to
pass
over
the
prominences
of
the
parietal
and
frontal
bones
above
this
line
the
head
rises
one
and
inches
during
our
walks
she
keeps
up
a
continual
spelling
and
delights
to
accompany
it
with
actions
such
as
skipping
hopping
jumping
running
walking
fast
walking
slow
and
the
like
when
she
drops
stitches
she
says
helen
wrong
teacher
will
cry
if
she
wants
water
she
says
give
helen
drink
water
she
knows
four
hundred
words
besides
numerous
proper
nouns
in
one
lesson
i
taught
her
these
words
bedstead
mattress
sheet
blanket
comforter
spread
pillow
the
next
day
i
found
that
she
remembered
all
but
spread
the
same
day
she
had
learned
at
different
times
the
words
house
weed
dust
swing
molasses
fast
slow
and
counter
and
she
had
not
forgotten
one
of
these
last
this
will
give
you
an
idea
of
the
retentive
memory
she
possesses
she
can
count
to
thirty
very
quickly
and
can
write
seven
of
the
letters
and
the
words
which
can
be
made
with
them
she
seems
to
understand
about
writing
letters
and
is
impatient
to
write
frank
letter
she
enjoys
punching
holes
in
paper
with
the
stiletto
and
i
supposed
it
was
because
she
could
examine
the
result
of
her
work
but
we
watched
her
one
day
and
i
was
much
surprised
to
find
that
she
imagined
she
was
writing
a
letter
she
would
spell
eva
a
cousin
of
whom
she
is
very
fond
with
one
hand
then
make
believe
to
write
it
then
spell
sick
in
bed
and
write
that
she
kept
this
up
for
nearly
an
hour
she
was
or
imagined
she
was
putting
on
paper
the
things
which
had
interested
her
when
she
had
finished
the
letter
she
carried
it
to
her
mother
and
spelled
frank
letter
and
gave
it
to
her
brother
to
take
to
the
she
had
been
with
me
to
take
letters
to
the
she
recognizes
instantly
a
person
whom
she
has
once
met
and
spells
the
name
unlike
laura
bridgman
she
is
fond
of
gentlemen
and
we
notice
that
she
makes
friends
with
a
gentleman
sooner
than
with
a
lady
she
is
always
ready
to
share
whatever
she
has
with
those
about
her
often
keeping
but
very
little
for
herself
she
is
very
fond
of
dress
and
of
all
kinds
of
finery
and
is
very
unhappy
when
she
finds
a
hole
in
anything
she
is
wearing
she
will
insist
on
having
her
hair
put
in
curl
papers
when
she
is
so
sleepy
she
can
scarcely
stand
she
discovered
a
hole
in
her
boot
the
other
morning
and
after
breakfast
she
went
to
her
father
and
spelled
helen
new
boot
simpson
her
brother
buggy
store
man
one
can
easily
see
her
meaning
july
there
was
a
great
rumpus
downstairs
this
morning
i
heard
helen
screaming
and
ran
down
to
see
what
was
the
matter
i
found
her
in
a
terrible
passion
i
had
hoped
this
would
never
happen
again
she
has
been
so
gentle
and
obedient
the
past
two
months
i
thought
love
had
subdued
the
lion
but
it
seems
he
was
only
sleeping
at
all
events
there
she
was
tearing
and
scratching
and
biting
viney
like
some
wild
thing
it
seems
viney
had
attempted
to
take
a
glass
which
helen
was
filling
with
stones
fearing
that
she
would
break
it
helen
resisted
and
viney
tried
to
force
it
out
of
her
hand
and
i
suspect
that
she
slapped
the
child
or
did
something
which
caused
this
unusual
outburst
of
temper
when
i
took
her
hand
she
was
trembling
violently
and
began
to
cry
i
asked
what
was
the
matter
and
she
spelled
viney
bad
and
began
to
slap
and
kick
her
with
renewed
violence
i
held
her
hands
firmly
until
she
became
more
calm
later
helen
came
to
my
room
looking
very
sad
and
wanted
to
kiss
me
i
said
i
can
not
kiss
naughty
girl
she
spelled
helen
is
good
viney
is
bad
i
said
you
struck
viney
and
kicked
her
and
hurt
her
you
were
very
naughty
and
i
can
not
kiss
naughty
girl
she
stood
very
still
for
a
moment
and
it
was
evident
from
her
face
which
was
flushed
and
troubled
that
a
struggle
was
going
on
in
her
mind
then
she
said
helen
did
does
not
love
teacher
helen
do
love
mother
mother
will
whip
viney
i
told
her
that
she
had
better
not
talk
about
it
any
more
but
think
she
knew
that
i
was
much
troubled
and
would
have
liked
to
stay
near
me
but
i
thought
it
best
for
her
to
sit
by
herself
at
the
she
was
greatly
disturbed
because
i
did
eat
and
suggested
that
cook
make
tea
for
teacher
but
i
told
her
that
my
heart
was
sad
and
i
did
feel
like
eating
she
began
to
cry
and
sob
and
clung
to
me
she
was
very
much
excited
when
we
went
upstairs
so
i
tried
to
interest
her
in
a
curious
insect
called
a
it
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
saw
a
little
bundle
of
fagots
fastened
together
in
the
middle
i
would
believe
it
was
alive
until
i
saw
it
move
even
then
it
looked
more
like
a
mechanical
toy
than
a
living
creature
but
the
poor
little
girl
could
fix
her
attention
her
heart
was
full
of
trouble
and
she
wanted
to
talk
about
it
she
said
can
bug
know
about
naughty
girl
is
bug
very
happy
then
putting
her
arms
round
my
neck
she
said
i
am
will
be
good
helen
is
will
be
good
all
days
i
said
will
you
tell
viney
you
are
very
sorry
you
scratched
and
kicked
her
she
smiled
and
answered
viney
can
not
spell
words
i
will
tell
viney
you
are
very
sorry
i
said
will
you
go
with
me
and
find
viney
she
was
very
willing
to
go
and
let
viney
kiss
her
though
she
return
the
caress
she
has
been
unusually
affectionate
since
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
in
her
face
which
i
have
not
seen
before
july
helen
is
excellent
as
you
will
see
from
the
enclosed
letter
which
she
wrote
for
her
own
amusement
i
am
teaching
her
the
braille
alphabet
and
she
is
delighted
to
be
able
to
make
words
herself
that
she
can
feel
she
has
now
reached
the
question
stage
of
her
development
it
is
what
why
when
especially
why
all
day
long
and
as
her
intelligence
grows
her
inquiries
become
more
insistent
i
remember
how
unbearable
i
used
to
find
the
inquisitiveness
of
my
friends
children
but
i
know
now
that
these
questions
indicate
the
child
growing
interest
in
the
cause
of
things
the
why
is
the
door
through
which
he
enters
the
world
of
reason
and
reflection
how
does
carpenter
know
to
build
house
who
put
chickens
in
eggs
why
is
viney
black
flies
bite
why
can
flies
know
not
to
bite
why
did
father
kill
sheep
of
course
she
asks
many
questions
that
are
not
as
intelligent
as
these
her
mind
is
more
logical
than
the
minds
of
ordinary
children
on
the
whole
her
questions
are
analogous
to
those
that
a
bright
child
asks
but
her
desire
for
knowledge
is
so
earnest
the
questions
are
never
tedious
though
they
draw
heavily
upon
my
meager
store
of
information
and
tax
my
ingenuity
to
the
utmost
i
had
a
letter
from
laura
bridgman
last
sunday
please
give
her
my
love
and
tell
her
helen
sends
her
a
kiss
i
read
the
letter
at
the
and
keller
exclaimed
my
miss
annie
helen
writes
almost
as
well
as
that
now
it
is
true
august
we
had
a
beautiful
time
in
huntsville
everybody
there
was
delighted
with
helen
and
showered
her
with
gifts
and
kisses
the
first
evening
she
learned
the
names
of
all
the
people
in
the
hotel
about
twenty
i
think
the
next
morning
we
were
astonished
to
find
that
she
remembered
all
of
them
and
recognized
every
one
she
had
met
the
night
before
she
taught
the
young
people
the
alphabet
and
several
of
them
learned
to
talk
with
her
one
of
the
girls
taught
her
to
dance
the
polka
and
a
little
boy
showed
her
his
rabbits
and
spelled
their
names
for
her
she
was
delighted
and
showed
her
pleasure
by
hugging
and
kissing
the
little
fellow
which
embarrassed
him
very
much
we
had
helen
picture
taken
with
a
fuzzy
little
poodle
who
got
himself
into
my
lady
good
graces
by
tricks
and
cunning
devices
known
only
to
dogs
with
an
instinct
for
getting
what
they
want
she
has
talked
incessantly
since
her
return
about
what
she
did
in
huntsville
and
we
notice
a
very
decided
improvement
in
her
ability
to
use
language
curiously
enough
a
drive
we
took
to
the
top
of
monte
sano
a
beautiful
mountain
not
far
from
huntsville
seems
to
have
impressed
her
more
than
anything
else
except
the
wonderful
poodle
she
remembers
all
that
i
told
her
about
it
and
in
telling
her
mother
repeated
the
very
words
and
phrases
i
had
used
in
describing
it
to
her
in
conclusion
she
asked
her
mother
if
she
should
like
to
see
very
high
mountain
and
beautiful
cloudcaps
i
had
used
this
expression
i
said
the
clouds
touch
the
mountain
softly
like
beautiful
flowers
you
see
i
had
to
use
words
and
images
with
which
she
was
familiar
through
the
sense
of
touch
but
it
hardly
seems
possible
that
any
mere
words
should
convey
to
one
who
has
never
seen
a
mountain
the
faintest
idea
of
its
grandeur
and
i
do
see
how
any
one
is
ever
to
know
what
impression
she
did
receive
or
the
cause
of
her
pleasure
in
what
was
told
her
about
it
all
that
we
do
know
certainly
is
that
she
has
a
good
memory
and
imagination
and
the
faculty
of
association
august
i
do
wish
things
would
stop
being
born
new
puppies
new
calves
and
new
babies
keep
helen
interest
in
the
why
and
wherefore
of
things
at
white
heat
the
arrival
of
a
new
baby
at
ivy
green
the
other
day
was
the
occasion
of
a
fresh
outburst
of
questions
about
the
origin
of
babies
and
live
things
in
general
where
did
leila
get
new
baby
how
did
doctor
know
where
to
find
baby
did
leila
tell
doctor
to
get
very
small
new
baby
where
did
doctor
find
guy
and
prince
puppies
why
is
elizabeth
evelyn
sister
etc
these
questions
were
sometimes
asked
under
circumstances
which
rendered
them
embarrassing
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
something
must
be
done
if
it
was
natural
for
helen
to
ask
such
questions
it
was
my
duty
to
answer
them
it
a
great
mistake
i
think
to
put
children
off
with
falsehoods
and
nonsense
when
their
growing
powers
of
observation
and
discrimination
excite
in
them
a
desire
to
know
about
things
from
the
beginning
i
have
made
it
a
practice
to
answer
all
helen
questions
to
the
best
of
my
ability
in
a
way
intelligible
to
her
and
at
the
same
time
truthfully
why
should
i
treat
these
questions
differently
i
asked
myself
i
decided
that
there
was
no
reason
except
my
deplorable
ignorance
of
the
great
facts
that
underlie
our
physical
existence
it
was
no
doubt
because
of
this
ignorance
that
i
rushed
in
where
more
experienced
angels
fear
to
tread
there
a
living
soul
in
this
part
of
the
world
to
whom
i
can
go
for
advice
in
this
or
indeed
in
any
other
educational
difficulty
the
only
thing
for
me
to
do
in
a
perplexity
is
to
go
ahead
and
learn
by
making
mistakes
but
in
this
case
i
do
think
i
made
a
mistake
i
took
helen
and
my
botany
how
plants
grow
up
in
the
tree
where
we
often
go
to
read
and
study
and
i
told
her
in
simple
words
the
story
of
plantlife
i
reminded
her
of
the
corn
beans
and
she
had
planted
in
the
spring
and
told
her
that
the
tall
corn
in
the
garden
and
the
beans
and
watermelon
vines
had
grown
from
those
seeds
i
explained
how
the
earth
keeps
the
seeds
warm
and
moist
until
the
little
leaves
are
strong
enough
to
push
themselves
out
into
the
light
and
air
where
they
can
breathe
and
grow
and
bloom
and
make
more
seeds
from
which
other
shall
grow
i
drew
an
analogy
between
plant
and
and
told
her
that
seeds
are
eggs
as
truly
as
hens
eggs
and
eggs
that
the
mother
hen
keeps
her
eggs
warm
and
dry
until
the
little
chicks
come
out
i
made
her
understand
that
all
life
comes
from
an
egg
the
mother
bird
lays
her
eggs
in
a
nest
and
keeps
them
warm
until
the
birdlings
are
hatched
the
mother
fish
lays
her
eggs
where
she
knows
they
will
be
moist
and
safe
until
it
is
time
for
the
little
fish
to
come
out
i
told
her
that
she
could
call
the
egg
the
cradle
of
life
then
i
told
her
that
other
animals
like
the
dog
and
cow
and
human
beings
do
not
lay
their
eggs
but
nourish
their
young
in
their
own
bodies
i
had
no
difficulty
in
making
it
clear
to
her
that
if
plants
and
animals
did
produce
offspring
after
their
kind
they
would
cease
to
exist
and
everything
in
the
world
would
soon
die
but
the
function
of
sex
i
passed
over
as
lightly
as
possible
i
did
however
try
to
give
her
the
idea
that
love
is
the
great
continuer
of
life
the
subject
was
difficult
and
my
knowledge
inadequate
but
i
am
glad
i
did
shirk
my
responsibility
for
stumbling
hesitating
and
incomplete
as
my
explanation
was
it
touched
deep
responsive
chords
in
the
soul
of
my
little
pupil
and
the
readiness
with
which
she
comprehended
the
great
facts
of
physical
life
confirmed
me
in
the
opinion
that
the
child
has
dormant
within
him
when
he
comes
into
the
world
all
the
experiences
of
the
race
these
experiences
are
like
photographic
negatives
until
language
develops
them
and
brings
out
the
september
helen
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
her
uncle
doctor
keller
he
invited
her
to
come
to
see
him
at
hot
springs
the
name
hot
springs
interested
her
and
she
asked
many
questions
about
it
she
knows
about
cold
springs
there
are
several
near
tuscumbia
one
very
large
one
from
which
the
town
got
its
name
tuscumbia
is
the
indian
for
great
spring
but
she
was
surprised
that
hot
water
should
come
out
of
the
ground
she
wanted
to
know
who
made
fire
under
the
ground
and
if
it
was
like
the
fire
in
stoves
and
if
it
burned
the
roots
of
plants
and
trees
she
was
much
pleased
with
the
letter
and
after
she
had
asked
all
the
questions
she
could
think
of
she
took
it
to
her
mother
who
was
sewing
in
the
hall
and
read
it
to
her
it
was
amusing
to
see
her
hold
it
before
her
eyes
and
spell
the
sentences
out
on
her
fingers
just
as
i
had
done
afterward
she
tried
to
read
it
to
belle
the
dog
and
mildred
keller
and
i
watched
the
nursery
comedy
from
the
door
belle
was
sleepy
and
mildred
inattentive
helen
looked
very
serious
and
once
or
twice
when
mildred
tried
to
take
the
letter
she
put
her
hand
away
impatiently
finally
belle
got
up
shook
herself
and
was
about
to
walk
away
when
helen
caught
her
by
the
neck
and
forced
her
to
lie
down
again
in
the
meantime
mildred
had
got
the
letter
and
crept
away
with
it
helen
felt
on
the
floor
for
it
but
not
finding
it
there
she
evidently
suspected
mildred
for
she
made
the
little
sound
which
is
her
baby
call
then
she
got
up
and
stood
very
still
as
if
listening
with
her
feet
for
mildred
thump
thump
when
she
had
located
the
sound
she
went
quickly
toward
the
little
culprit
and
found
her
chewing
the
precious
letter
this
was
too
much
for
helen
she
snatched
the
letter
and
slapped
the
little
hands
soundly
keller
took
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
when
we
had
succeeded
in
pacifying
her
i
asked
helen
what
did
you
do
to
baby
she
looked
troubled
and
hesitated
a
moment
before
answering
then
she
said
wrong
girl
did
eat
letter
helen
did
slap
very
wrong
girl
i
told
her
that
mildred
was
very
small
and
know
that
it
was
wrong
to
put
the
letter
in
her
mouth
i
did
tell
baby
no
no
much
many
times
was
helen
reply
i
said
mildred
does
understand
your
fingers
and
we
must
be
very
gentle
with
her
she
shook
her
head
baby
not
think
helen
will
give
baby
pretty
letter
and
with
that
she
ran
upstairs
and
brought
down
a
neatly
folded
sheet
of
braille
on
which
she
had
written
some
words
and
gave
it
to
mildred
saying
baby
can
eat
all
words
september
i
do
not
wonder
you
were
surprised
to
hear
that
i
was
going
to
write
something
for
the
report
i
do
not
know
myself
how
it
happened
except
that
i
got
tired
of
saying
no
and
captain
keller
urged
me
to
do
it
he
agreed
with
anagnos
that
it
was
my
duty
to
give
others
the
benefit
of
my
experience
besides
they
said
helen
wonderful
deliverance
might
be
a
boon
to
other
afflicted
children
when
i
sit
down
to
write
my
thoughts
freeze
and
when
i
get
them
on
paper
they
look
like
wooden
soldiers
all
in
a
row
and
if
a
live
one
happens
along
i
put
him
in
a
it
easy
enough
however
to
say
helen
is
wonderful
because
she
really
is
i
kept
a
record
of
everything
she
said
last
week
and
i
found
that
she
knows
six
hundred
words
this
does
not
mean
however
that
she
always
uses
them
correctly
sometimes
her
sentences
are
like
chinese
puzzles
but
they
are
the
kind
of
puzzles
children
make
when
they
try
to
express
their
ideas
by
means
of
arbitrary
language
she
has
the
true
and
shows
great
fertility
of
resource
in
making
the
words
at
her
command
convey
her
meaning
lately
she
has
been
much
interested
in
colour
she
found
the
word
brown
in
her
primer
and
wanted
to
know
its
meaning
i
told
her
that
her
hair
was
brown
and
she
asked
is
brown
very
pretty
after
we
had
been
all
over
the
house
and
i
had
told
her
the
colour
of
everything
she
touched
she
suggested
that
we
go
to
the
and
barns
but
i
told
her
she
must
wait
until
another
day
because
i
was
very
tired
we
sat
in
the
hammock
but
there
was
no
rest
for
the
weary
there
helen
was
eager
to
know
more
colour
i
wonder
if
she
has
any
vague
idea
of
colour
any
reminiscent
impression
of
light
and
sound
it
seems
as
if
a
child
who
could
see
and
hear
until
her
nineteenth
month
must
retain
some
of
her
first
impressions
though
ever
so
faintly
helen
talks
a
great
deal
about
things
that
she
can
not
know
of
through
the
sense
of
touch
she
asks
many
questions
about
the
sky
day
and
night
the
ocean
and
mountains
she
likes
to
have
me
tell
her
what
i
see
in
pictures
but
i
seem
to
have
lost
the
thread
of
my
discourse
what
colour
is
think
was
one
of
the
restful
questions
she
asked
as
we
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
hammock
i
told
her
that
when
we
are
happy
our
thoughts
are
bright
and
when
we
are
naughty
they
are
sad
quick
as
a
flash
she
said
my
think
is
white
viney
think
is
black
you
see
she
had
an
idea
that
the
colour
of
our
thoughts
matched
that
of
our
skin
i
help
laughing
for
at
that
very
moment
viney
was
shouting
at
the
top
of
her
voice
i
long
to
sit
on
dem
jasper
walls
and
see
dem
sinners
stumble
and
fall
october
my
account
for
the
report
is
finished
and
sent
off
i
have
two
copies
and
will
send
you
one
but
you
must
show
it
to
anybody
it
anagnos
property
until
it
is
published
i
suppose
the
little
girls
enjoyed
helen
letter
she
wrote
it
out
of
her
own
head
as
the
children
say
she
talks
a
great
deal
about
what
she
will
do
when
she
goes
to
boston
she
asked
the
other
day
who
made
all
things
and
boston
she
says
mildred
will
not
go
there
because
baby
does
cry
all
days
october
helen
wrote
another
letter
to
the
little
girls
yesterday
and
her
father
sent
it
to
anagnos
ask
him
to
let
you
see
it
she
has
begun
to
use
the
pronouns
of
her
own
accord
this
morning
i
happened
to
say
helen
will
go
upstairs
she
laughed
and
said
teacher
is
wrong
you
will
go
upstairs
this
is
another
great
forward
step
thus
it
always
is
yesterday
perplexities
are
strangely
simple
and
difficulties
become
pastime
the
rapid
development
of
helen
mind
is
beautiful
to
watch
i
doubt
if
any
teacher
ever
had
a
work
of
such
absorbing
interest
there
must
have
been
one
lucky
star
in
the
heavens
at
my
birth
and
i
am
just
beginning
to
feel
its
beneficent
influence
i
had
two
letters
from
anagnos
last
week
he
is
more
grateful
for
my
report
than
the
english
idiom
will
express
now
he
wants
a
picture
of
darling
helen
and
her
illustrious
teacher
to
grace
the
pages
of
the
forthcoming
annual
report
october
you
have
probably
read
ere
this
helen
second
letter
to
the
little
girls
i
am
aware
that
the
progress
which
she
has
made
between
the
writing
of
the
two
letters
must
seem
incredible
only
those
who
are
with
her
daily
can
realize
the
rapid
advancement
which
she
is
making
in
the
acquisition
of
language
you
will
see
from
her
letter
that
she
uses
many
pronouns
correctly
she
rarely
misuses
or
omits
one
in
conversation
her
passion
for
writing
letters
and
putting
her
thoughts
upon
paper
grows
more
intense
she
now
tells
stories
in
which
the
imagination
plays
an
important
part
she
is
also
beginning
to
realize
that
she
is
not
like
other
children
the
other
day
she
asked
what
do
my
eyes
do
i
told
her
that
i
could
see
things
with
my
eyes
and
that
she
could
see
them
with
her
fingers
after
thinking
a
moment
she
said
my
eyes
are
bad
then
she
changed
it
into
my
eyes
are
sick
miss
sullivan
first
report
which
was
published
in
the
official
report
of
the
perkins
institution
for
the
year
is
a
short
summary
of
what
is
fully
recorded
in
the
letters
here
follows
the
last
part
beginning
with
the
great
day
april
when
helen
learned
water
in
her
reports
miss
sullivan
speaks
of
lessons
as
if
they
came
in
regular
order
this
is
the
effect
of
putting
it
all
in
a
summary
lesson
is
too
formal
for
the
continuous
daily
work
one
day
i
took
her
to
the
cistern
as
the
water
gushed
from
the
pump
i
spelled
instantly
she
tapped
my
hand
for
a
repetition
and
then
made
the
word
herself
with
a
radiant
face
just
then
the
nurse
came
into
the
bringing
her
little
sister
i
put
helen
hand
on
the
baby
and
formed
the
letters
which
she
repeated
without
help
and
with
the
light
of
a
new
intelligence
in
her
face
on
our
way
back
to
the
house
everything
she
touched
had
to
be
named
for
her
and
repetition
was
seldom
necessary
neither
the
length
of
the
word
nor
the
combination
of
letters
seems
to
make
any
difference
to
the
child
indeed
she
remembers
heliotrope
and
chrysanthemum
more
readily
than
she
does
shorter
names
at
the
end
of
august
she
knew
words
this
lesson
was
followed
by
one
on
words
indicative
of
her
dress
was
put
in
a
trunk
and
then
on
it
and
these
prepositions
were
spelled
for
her
very
soon
she
learned
the
difference
between
on
and
in
though
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
use
these
words
in
sentences
of
her
own
whenever
it
was
possible
she
was
made
the
actor
in
the
lesson
and
was
delighted
to
stand
on
the
chair
and
to
be
put
into
the
wardrobe
in
connection
with
this
lesson
she
learned
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
family
and
the
word
is
helen
is
in
wardrobe
mildred
is
in
crib
box
is
on
table
papa
is
on
bed
are
specimens
of
sentences
constructed
by
her
during
the
latter
part
of
april
next
came
a
lesson
on
words
expressive
of
positive
quality
for
the
first
lesson
i
had
two
balls
one
made
of
worsted
large
and
soft
the
other
a
bullet
she
perceived
the
difference
in
size
at
once
taking
the
bullet
she
made
her
habitual
sign
for
small
that
is
by
pinching
a
little
bit
of
the
skin
of
one
hand
then
she
took
the
other
ball
and
made
her
sign
for
large
by
spreading
both
hands
over
it
i
substituted
the
adjectives
large
and
small
for
those
signs
then
her
attention
was
called
to
the
hardness
of
the
one
ball
and
the
softness
of
the
other
and
she
learned
soft
and
hard
a
few
minutes
afterward
she
felt
of
her
little
sister
head
and
said
to
her
mother
mildred
head
is
small
and
hard
next
i
tried
to
teach
her
the
meaning
of
fast
and
slow
she
helped
me
wind
some
worsted
one
day
first
rapidly
and
afterward
slowly
i
then
said
to
her
with
the
finger
alphabet
wind
fast
or
wind
slow
holding
her
hands
and
showing
her
how
to
do
as
i
wished
the
next
day
while
exercising
she
spelled
to
me
helen
wind
fast
and
began
to
walk
rapidly
then
she
said
helen
wind
slow
again
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
i
now
thought
it
time
to
teach
her
to
read
printed
words
a
slip
on
which
was
printed
in
raised
letters
the
word
box
was
placed
on
the
object
and
the
same
experiment
was
tried
with
a
great
many
articles
but
she
did
not
immediately
comprehend
that
the
represented
the
thing
then
i
took
an
alphabet
sheet
and
put
her
finger
on
the
letter
a
at
the
same
time
making
a
with
my
fingers
she
moved
her
finger
from
one
printed
character
to
another
as
i
formed
each
letter
on
my
fingers
she
learned
all
the
letters
both
capital
and
small
in
one
day
next
i
turned
to
the
first
page
of
the
primer
and
made
her
touch
the
word
cat
spelling
it
on
my
fingers
at
the
same
time
instantly
she
caught
the
idea
and
asked
me
to
find
dog
and
many
other
words
indeed
she
was
much
displeased
because
i
could
not
find
her
name
in
the
book
just
then
i
had
no
sentences
in
raised
letters
which
she
could
understand
but
she
would
sit
for
hours
feeling
each
word
in
her
book
when
she
touched
one
with
which
she
was
familiar
a
peculiarly
sweet
expression
lighted
her
face
and
we
saw
her
countenance
growing
sweeter
and
more
earnest
every
day
about
this
time
i
sent
a
list
of
the
words
she
knew
to
anagnos
and
he
very
kindly
had
them
printed
for
her
her
mother
and
i
cut
up
several
sheets
of
printed
words
so
that
she
could
arrange
them
into
sentences
this
delighted
her
more
than
anything
she
had
yet
done
and
the
practice
thus
obtained
prepared
the
way
for
the
writing
lessons
there
was
no
difficulty
in
making
her
understand
how
to
write
the
same
sentences
with
pencil
and
paper
which
she
made
every
day
with
the
slips
and
she
very
soon
perceived
that
she
need
not
confine
herself
to
phrases
already
learned
but
could
communicate
any
thought
that
was
passing
through
her
mind
i
put
one
of
the
writing
boards
used
by
the
blind
between
the
folds
of
the
paper
on
the
table
and
allowed
her
to
examine
an
alphabet
of
the
square
letters
such
as
she
was
to
make
i
then
guided
her
hand
to
form
the
sentence
cat
does
drink
milk
when
she
finished
it
she
was
overjoyed
she
carried
it
to
her
mother
who
spelled
it
to
her
day
after
day
she
moved
her
pencil
in
the
same
tracks
along
the
grooved
paper
never
for
a
moment
expressing
the
least
impatience
or
sense
of
fatigue
as
she
had
now
learned
to
express
her
ideas
on
paper
i
next
taught
her
the
braille
system
she
learned
it
gladly
when
she
discovered
that
she
could
herself
read
what
she
had
written
and
this
still
affords
her
constant
pleasure
for
a
whole
evening
she
will
sit
at
the
table
writing
whatever
comes
into
her
busy
brain
and
i
seldom
find
any
difficulty
in
reading
what
she
has
written
her
progress
in
arithmetic
has
been
equally
remarkable
she
can
add
and
subtract
with
great
rapidity
up
to
the
sum
of
one
hundred
and
she
knows
the
multiplication
tables
as
far
as
the
fives
she
was
working
recently
with
the
number
forty
when
i
said
to
her
make
twos
she
replied
immediately
twenty
twos
make
forty
later
i
said
make
fifteen
threes
and
count
i
wished
her
to
make
the
groups
of
threes
and
supposed
she
would
then
have
to
count
them
in
order
to
know
what
number
fifteen
threes
would
make
but
instantly
she
spelled
the
answer
fifteen
threes
make
on
being
told
that
she
was
white
and
that
one
of
the
servants
was
black
she
concluded
that
all
who
occupied
a
similar
menial
position
were
of
the
same
hue
and
whenever
i
asked
her
the
colour
of
a
servant
she
would
say
black
when
asked
the
colour
of
some
one
whose
occupation
she
did
not
know
she
seemed
bewildered
and
finally
said
blue
she
has
never
been
told
anything
about
death
or
the
burial
of
the
body
and
yet
on
entering
the
cemetery
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
with
her
mother
and
me
to
look
at
some
flowers
she
laid
her
hand
on
our
eyes
and
repeatedly
spelled
cry
cry
her
eyes
actually
filled
with
tears
the
flowers
did
not
seem
to
give
her
pleasure
and
she
was
very
quiet
while
we
stayed
there
on
another
occasion
while
walking
with
me
she
seemed
conscious
of
the
presence
of
her
brother
although
we
were
distant
from
him
she
spelled
his
name
repeatedly
and
started
in
the
direction
in
which
he
was
coming
when
walking
or
riding
she
often
gives
the
names
of
the
people
we
meet
almost
as
soon
as
we
recognize
them
the
letters
take
up
the
account
again
november
we
took
helen
to
the
circus
and
had
the
time
of
our
lives
the
circus
people
were
much
interested
in
helen
and
did
everything
they
could
to
make
her
first
circus
a
memorable
event
they
let
her
feel
the
animals
whenever
it
was
safe
she
fed
the
elephants
and
was
allowed
to
climb
up
on
the
back
of
the
largest
and
sit
in
the
lap
of
the
oriental
princess
while
the
elephant
marched
majestically
around
the
ring
she
felt
some
young
lions
they
were
as
gentle
as
kittens
but
i
told
her
they
would
get
wild
and
fierce
as
they
grew
older
she
said
to
the
keeper
i
will
take
the
baby
lions
home
and
teach
them
to
be
mild
the
keeper
of
the
bears
made
one
big
black
fellow
stand
on
his
hind
legs
and
hold
out
his
great
paw
to
us
which
helen
shook
politely
she
was
greatly
delighted
with
the
monkeys
and
kept
her
hand
on
the
star
performer
while
he
went
through
his
tricks
and
laughed
heartily
when
he
took
off
his
hat
to
the
audience
one
cute
little
fellow
stole
her
and
another
tried
to
snatch
the
flowers
out
of
her
hat
i
do
know
who
had
the
best
time
the
monkeys
helen
or
the
spectators
one
of
the
leopards
licked
her
hands
and
the
man
in
charge
of
the
giraffes
lifted
her
up
in
his
arms
so
that
she
could
feel
their
ears
and
see
how
tall
they
were
she
also
felt
a
greek
chariot
and
the
charioteer
would
have
liked
to
take
her
round
the
ring
but
she
was
afraid
of
many
swift
horses
the
riders
and
clowns
and
were
all
glad
to
let
the
little
blind
girl
feel
their
costumes
and
follow
their
motions
whenever
it
was
possible
and
she
kissed
them
all
to
show
her
gratitude
some
of
them
cried
and
the
wild
man
of
borneo
shrank
from
her
sweet
little
face
in
terror
she
has
talked
about
nothing
but
the
circus
ever
since
in
order
to
answer
her
questions
i
have
been
obliged
to
read
a
great
deal
about
animals
at
present
i
feel
like
a
jungle
on
wheels
december
i
find
it
hard
to
realize
that
christmas
is
almost
here
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
helen
talks
about
nothing
else
do
you
remember
what
a
happy
time
we
had
last
christmas
helen
has
learned
to
tell
the
time
at
last
and
her
father
is
going
to
give
her
a
watch
for
christmas
helen
is
as
eager
to
have
stories
told
her
as
any
hearing
child
i
ever
knew
she
has
made
me
repeat
the
story
of
little
red
riding
hood
so
often
that
i
believe
i
could
say
it
backward
she
likes
stories
that
make
her
cry
i
think
we
all
do
it
so
nice
to
feel
sad
when
nothing
particular
to
be
sad
about
i
am
teaching
her
little
rhymes
and
verses
too
they
fix
beautiful
thoughts
in
her
memory
i
think
too
that
they
quicken
all
the
child
faculties
because
they
stimulate
the
imagination
of
course
i
do
try
to
explain
everything
if
i
did
there
would
be
no
opportunity
for
the
play
of
fancy
too
much
explanation
directs
the
child
attention
to
words
and
sentences
so
that
he
fails
to
get
the
thought
as
a
whole
i
do
not
think
anyone
can
read
or
talk
for
that
matter
until
he
forgets
words
and
sentences
in
the
technical
sense
january
it
is
a
great
thing
to
feel
that
you
are
of
some
use
in
the
world
that
you
are
necessary
to
somebody
helen
dependence
on
me
for
almost
everything
makes
me
strong
and
glad
christmas
week
was
a
very
busy
one
here
too
helen
is
invited
to
all
the
children
entertainments
and
i
take
her
to
as
many
as
i
can
i
want
her
to
know
children
and
to
be
with
them
as
much
as
possible
several
little
girls
have
learned
to
spell
on
their
fingers
and
are
very
proud
of
the
accomplishment
one
little
chap
about
seven
was
persuaded
to
learn
the
letters
and
he
spelled
his
name
for
helen
she
was
delighted
and
showed
her
joy
by
hugging
and
kissing
him
much
to
his
embarrassment
saturday
the
had
their
tree
and
i
took
helen
it
was
the
first
christmas
tree
she
had
ever
seen
and
she
was
puzzled
and
asked
many
questions
who
made
tree
grow
in
house
why
who
put
many
things
on
tree
she
objected
to
its
miscellaneous
fruits
and
began
to
remove
them
evidently
thinking
they
were
all
meant
for
her
it
was
not
difficult
however
to
make
her
understand
that
there
was
a
present
for
each
child
and
to
her
great
delight
she
was
permitted
to
hand
the
gifts
to
the
children
there
were
several
presents
for
herself
she
placed
them
in
a
chair
resisting
all
temptation
to
look
at
them
until
every
child
had
received
his
gifts
one
little
girl
had
fewer
presents
than
the
rest
and
helen
insisted
on
sharing
her
gifts
with
her
it
was
very
sweet
to
see
the
children
eager
interest
in
helen
and
their
readiness
to
give
her
pleasure
the
exercises
began
at
nine
and
it
was
one
before
we
could
leave
my
fingers
and
head
ached
but
helen
was
as
fresh
and
full
of
spirit
as
when
we
left
home
after
dinner
it
began
to
snow
and
we
had
a
good
frolic
and
an
interesting
lesson
about
the
snow
sunday
morning
the
ground
was
covered
and
helen
and
the
cook
children
and
i
played
snowball
by
noon
the
snow
was
all
gone
it
was
the
first
snow
i
had
seen
here
and
it
made
me
a
little
homesick
the
christmas
season
has
furnished
many
lessons
and
added
scores
of
new
words
to
helen
vocabulary
for
weeks
we
did
nothing
but
talk
and
read
and
tell
each
other
stories
about
christmas
of
course
i
do
not
try
to
explain
all
the
new
words
nor
does
helen
fully
understand
the
little
stories
i
tell
her
but
constant
repetition
fixes
the
words
and
phrases
in
the
mind
and
little
by
little
the
meaning
will
come
to
her
i
see
no
sense
in
faking
conversation
for
the
sake
of
teaching
language
it
stupid
and
deadening
to
pupil
and
teacher
talk
should
be
natural
and
have
for
its
object
an
exchange
of
ideas
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
child
mind
to
communicate
it
hardly
seems
worth
while
to
require
him
to
write
on
the
blackboard
or
spell
on
his
fingers
cut
and
dried
sentences
about
the
cat
the
bird
a
dog
i
have
tried
from
the
beginning
to
talk
naturally
to
helen
and
to
teach
her
to
tell
me
only
things
that
interest
her
and
ask
questions
only
for
the
sake
of
finding
out
what
she
wants
to
know
when
i
see
that
she
is
eager
to
tell
me
something
but
is
hampered
because
she
does
not
know
the
words
i
supply
them
and
the
necessary
idioms
and
we
get
along
finely
the
child
eagerness
and
interest
carry
her
over
many
obstacles
that
would
be
our
undoing
if
we
stopped
to
define
and
explain
everything
what
would
happen
do
you
think
if
some
one
should
try
to
measure
our
intelligence
by
our
ability
to
define
the
commonest
words
we
use
i
fear
me
if
i
were
put
to
such
a
test
i
should
be
consigned
to
the
primary
class
in
a
school
for
the
it
was
touching
and
beautiful
to
see
helen
enjoy
her
first
christmas
of
course
she
hung
her
stocking
two
of
them
lest
santa
claus
should
forget
one
and
she
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
and
got
up
two
or
three
times
to
see
if
anything
had
happened
when
i
told
her
that
santa
claus
would
not
come
until
she
was
asleep
she
shut
her
eyes
and
said
he
will
think
girl
is
asleep
she
was
awake
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
ran
to
the
fireplace
for
her
stocking
and
when
she
found
that
santa
claus
had
filled
both
stockings
she
danced
about
for
a
minute
then
grew
very
quiet
and
came
to
ask
me
if
i
thought
santa
claus
had
made
a
mistake
and
thought
there
were
two
little
girls
and
would
come
back
for
the
gifts
when
he
discovered
his
mistake
the
ring
you
sent
her
was
in
the
toe
of
the
stocking
and
when
i
told
her
you
gave
it
to
santa
claus
for
her
she
said
i
do
love
mrs
hopkins
she
had
a
trunk
and
clothes
for
nancy
and
her
comment
was
now
nancy
will
go
to
party
when
she
saw
the
braille
slate
and
paper
she
said
i
will
write
many
letters
and
i
will
thank
santa
claus
very
much
it
was
evident
that
every
one
especially
captain
and
keller
was
deeply
moved
at
the
thought
of
the
difference
between
this
bright
christmas
and
the
last
when
their
little
girl
had
no
conscious
part
in
the
christmas
festivities
as
we
came
downstairs
keller
said
to
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
miss
annie
i
thank
god
every
day
of
my
life
for
sending
you
to
us
but
i
never
realized
until
this
morning
what
a
blessing
you
have
been
to
us
captain
keller
took
my
hand
but
could
not
speak
but
his
silence
was
more
eloquent
than
words
my
heart
too
was
full
of
gratitude
and
solemn
joy
the
other
day
helen
came
across
the
word
grandfather
in
a
little
story
and
asked
her
mother
where
is
grandfather
meaning
her
grandfather
keller
replied
he
is
dead
did
father
shoot
him
helen
asked
and
added
i
will
eat
grandfather
for
dinner
so
far
her
only
knowledge
of
death
is
in
connection
with
things
to
eat
she
knows
that
her
father
shoots
partridges
and
deer
and
other
game
this
morning
she
asked
me
the
meaning
of
carpenter
and
the
question
furnished
the
text
for
the
day
lesson
after
talking
about
the
various
things
that
carpenters
make
she
asked
me
did
carpenter
make
me
and
before
i
could
answer
she
spelled
quickly
no
no
photographer
made
me
in
sheffield
one
of
the
greatest
iron
furnaces
has
been
started
in
sheffield
and
we
went
over
the
other
evening
to
see
them
make
a
run
helen
felt
the
heat
and
asked
did
the
sun
fall
january
the
report
came
last
night
i
appreciate
the
kind
things
anagnos
has
said
about
helen
and
me
but
his
extravagant
way
of
saying
them
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
the
simple
facts
would
be
so
much
more
convincing
why
for
instance
does
he
take
the
trouble
to
ascribe
motives
to
me
that
i
never
dreamed
of
you
know
and
he
knows
and
i
know
that
my
motive
in
coming
here
was
not
in
any
sense
philanthropic
how
ridiculous
it
is
to
say
i
had
drunk
so
copiously
of
the
noble
spirit
of
howe
that
i
was
fired
with
the
desire
to
rescue
from
darkness
and
obscurity
the
little
alabamian
i
came
here
simply
because
circumstances
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
earn
my
living
and
i
seized
upon
the
first
opportunity
that
offered
itself
although
i
did
not
suspect
nor
did
he
that
i
had
any
special
fitness
for
the
work
january
i
suppose
you
got
helen
letter
the
little
rascal
has
taken
it
into
her
head
not
to
write
with
a
pencil
i
wanted
her
to
write
to
her
uncle
frank
this
morning
but
she
objected
she
said
pencil
is
very
tired
in
head
i
will
write
uncle
frank
braille
letter
i
said
but
uncle
frank
can
not
read
braille
i
will
teach
him
she
said
i
explained
that
uncle
frank
was
old
and
could
learn
braille
easily
in
a
flash
she
answered
i
think
uncle
frank
is
much
too
old
to
read
very
small
letters
finally
i
persuaded
her
to
write
a
few
lines
but
she
broke
her
pencil
six
times
before
she
finished
it
i
said
to
her
you
are
a
naughty
girl
no
she
replied
pencil
is
very
weak
i
think
her
objection
to
is
readily
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
she
has
been
asked
to
write
so
many
specimens
for
friends
and
strangers
you
know
how
the
children
at
the
institution
detest
it
it
is
irksome
because
the
process
is
so
slow
and
they
can
not
read
what
they
have
written
or
correct
their
mistakes
helen
is
more
and
more
interested
in
colour
when
i
told
her
that
mildred
eyes
were
blue
she
asked
are
they
like
wee
skies
a
little
while
after
i
had
told
her
that
a
carnation
that
had
been
given
her
was
red
she
puckered
up
her
mouth
and
said
lips
are
like
one
pink
i
told
her
they
were
tulips
but
of
course
she
did
understand
the
i
ca
believe
that
the
she
received
during
the
year
and
a
half
she
could
see
and
hear
are
entirely
lost
everything
we
have
seen
and
heard
is
in
the
mind
somewhere
it
may
be
too
vague
and
confused
to
be
recognizable
but
it
is
there
all
the
same
like
the
landscape
we
lose
in
the
deepening
twilight
february
we
got
home
last
night
we
had
a
splendid
time
in
memphis
but
i
rest
much
it
was
nothing
but
excitement
from
first
to
last
drives
luncheons
receptions
and
all
that
they
involve
when
you
have
an
eager
tireless
child
like
helen
on
your
hands
she
talked
incessantly
i
know
what
i
should
have
done
had
some
of
the
young
people
not
learned
to
talk
with
her
they
relieved
me
as
much
as
possible
but
even
then
i
can
never
have
a
quiet
half
hour
to
myself
it
is
always
oh
miss
sullivan
please
come
and
tell
us
what
helen
means
or
miss
sullivan
wo
you
please
explain
this
to
helen
we
ca
make
her
understand
i
believe
half
the
white
population
of
memphis
called
on
us
helen
was
petted
and
caressed
enough
to
spoil
an
angel
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
spoil
her
she
is
too
unconscious
of
herself
and
too
loving
the
stores
in
memphis
are
very
good
and
i
managed
to
spend
all
the
money
that
i
had
with
me
one
day
helen
said
i
must
buy
nancy
a
very
pretty
hat
i
said
very
well
we
will
go
shopping
this
afternoon
she
had
a
silver
dollar
and
a
dime
when
we
reached
the
shop
i
asked
her
how
much
she
would
pay
for
nancy
hat
she
answered
promptly
i
will
pay
ten
cents
what
will
you
do
with
the
dollar
i
asked
i
will
buy
some
good
candy
to
take
to
tuscumbia
was
her
reply
we
visited
the
stock
exchange
and
a
steamboat
helen
was
greatly
interested
in
the
boat
and
insisted
on
being
shown
every
inch
of
it
from
the
engine
to
the
flag
on
the
flagstaff
i
was
gratified
to
read
what
the
nation
had
to
say
about
helen
last
week
captain
keller
has
had
two
interesting
letters
since
the
publication
of
the
report
one
from
alexander
graham
bell
and
the
other
from
edward
everett
hale
hale
claims
kinship
with
helen
and
seems
very
proud
of
his
little
cousin
bell
writes
that
helen
progress
is
without
a
parallel
in
the
education
of
the
deaf
or
something
like
that
and
he
says
many
nice
things
about
her
teacher
march
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
finish
my
letter
yesterday
miss
ev
came
up
to
help
me
make
a
list
of
words
helen
has
learned
we
have
got
as
far
as
p
and
there
are
words
to
her
credit
i
had
helen
begin
a
journal
march
most
of
this
journal
was
lost
fortunately
however
helen
keller
wrote
so
many
letters
and
exercises
that
there
is
no
lack
of
records
of
that
sort
i
do
know
how
long
she
will
keep
it
up
rather
stupid
business
i
think
just
now
she
finds
it
great
fun
she
seems
to
like
to
tell
all
she
knows
this
is
what
helen
wrote
sunday

helen
keller
april
we
are
just
back
from
church
captain
keller
said
at
breakfast
this
morning
that
he
wished
i
would
take
helen
to
church
the
presbytery
would
be
there
in
a
body
and
he
wanted
the
ministers
to
see
helen
the
was
in
session
when
we
arrived
and
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
sensation
helen
entrance
caused
the
children
were
so
pleased
to
see
her
at
they
paid
no
attention
to
their
teachers
but
rushed
out
of
their
seats
and
surrounded
us
she
kissed
them
all
boys
and
girls
willing
or
unwilling
she
seemed
to
think
at
first
that
the
children
all
belonged
to
the
visiting
ministers
but
soon
she
recognized
some
little
friends
among
them
and
i
told
her
the
ministers
did
bring
their
children
with
them
she
looked
disappointed
and
said
i
send
them
many
kisses
one
of
the
ministers
wished
me
to
ask
helen
what
do
ministers
do
she
said
they
read
and
talk
loud
to
people
to
be
good
he
put
her
answer
down
in
his
note
book
when
it
was
time
for
the
church
service
to
begin
she
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
that
i
thought
it
best
to
take
her
away
but
captain
keller
said
no
she
will
be
all
right
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
stay
it
was
impossible
to
keep
helen
quiet
she
hugged
and
kissed
me
and
the
divine
who
sat
on
the
other
side
of
her
he
gave
her
his
watch
to
play
with
but
that
did
keep
her
still
she
wanted
to
show
it
to
the
little
boy
in
the
seat
behind
us
when
the
communion
service
began
she
smelt
the
wine
and
sniffed
so
loud
that
every
one
in
the
church
could
hear
when
the
wine
was
passed
to
our
neighbour
he
was
obliged
to
stand
up
to
prevent
her
taking
it
away
from
him
i
never
was
so
glad
to
get
out
of
a
place
as
i
was
to
leave
that
church
i
tried
to
hurry
helen
but
she
kept
her
arm
extended
and
every
she
touched
must
needs
turn
round
and
give
an
account
of
the
children
he
left
at
home
and
receive
kisses
according
to
their
number
everybody
laughed
at
her
antics
and
you
would
have
thought
they
were
leaving
a
place
of
amusement
rather
than
a
church
captain
keller
invited
some
of
the
ministers
to
dinner
helen
was
irrepressible
she
described
in
the
most
animated
pantomime
supplemented
by
spelling
what
she
was
going
to
do
in
brewster
finally
she
got
up
from
the
table
and
went
through
the
motion
of
picking
seaweed
and
shells
and
splashing
in
the
water
holding
up
her
skirts
higher
than
was
proper
under
the
circumstances
then
she
threw
herself
on
the
floor
and
began
to
swim
so
energetically
that
some
of
us
thought
we
should
be
kicked
out
of
our
chairs
her
motions
are
often
more
expressive
than
any
words
and
she
is
as
graceful
as
a
nymph
i
wonder
if
the
days
seem
as
interminable
to
you
as
they
do
to
me
we
talk
and
plan
and
dream
about
nothing
but
boston
boston
boston
i
think
keller
has
definitely
decided
to
go
with
us
but
she
will
not
stay
all
summer
may
do
you
realize
that
this
is
the
last
letter
i
shall
write
to
you
for
a
long
long
time
the
next
word
that
you
receive
from
me
will
be
in
a
yellow
envelope
and
it
will
tell
you
when
we
shall
reach
boston
i
am
too
happy
to
write
letters
but
i
must
tell
you
about
our
visit
to
cincinnati
we
spent
a
delightful
week
with
the
doctors
keller
met
us
in
memphis
almost
every
one
on
the
train
was
a
physician
and
keller
seemed
to
know
them
all
when
we
reached
cincinnati
we
found
the
place
full
of
doctors
there
were
several
prominent
boston
physicians
among
them
we
stayed
at
the
burnet
house
everybody
was
delighted
with
helen
all
the
learned
men
marveled
at
her
intelligence
and
gaiety
there
is
something
about
her
that
attracts
people
i
think
it
is
her
joyous
interest
in
everything
and
everybody
wherever
she
went
she
was
the
centre
of
interest
she
was
delighted
with
the
orchestra
at
the
hotel
and
whenever
the
music
began
she
danced
round
the
room
hugging
and
kissing
every
one
she
happened
to
touch
her
happiness
impressed
all
nobody
seemed
to
pity
her
one
gentleman
said
to
keller
i
have
lived
long
and
seen
many
happy
faces
but
i
have
never
seen
such
a
radiant
face
as
this
child
before
another
said
damn
me
but
i
give
everything
i
own
in
the
world
to
have
that
little
girl
always
near
me
but
i
have
time
to
write
all
the
pleasant
things
people
said
they
would
make
a
very
large
book
and
the
kind
things
they
did
for
us
would
fill
another
volume
keller
distributed
the
extracts
from
the
report
that
anagnos
sent
me
and
he
could
have
disposed
of
a
thousand
if
he
had
had
them
do
you
remember
garcelon
who
was
governor
of
maine
several
years
ago
he
took
us
to
drive
one
afternoon
and
wanted
to
give
helen
a
doll
but
she
said
i
do
not
like
too
many
children
nancy
is
sick
and
adeline
is
cross
and
ida
is
very
bad
we
laughed
until
we
cried
she
was
so
serious
about
it
what
would
you
like
then
asked
the
doctor
some
beautiful
gloves
to
talk
with
she
answered
the
doctor
was
puzzled
he
had
never
heard
of
but
i
explained
that
she
had
seen
a
glove
on
which
the
alphabet
was
printed
and
evidently
thought
they
could
be
bought
i
told
him
he
could
buy
some
gloves
if
he
wished
and
that
i
would
have
the
alphabet
stamped
on
them
we
lunched
with
thayer
your
former
pastor
and
his
wife
he
asked
me
how
i
had
taught
helen
adjectives
and
the
names
of
abstract
ideas
like
goodness
and
happiness
these
same
questions
had
been
asked
me
a
hundred
times
by
the
learned
doctors
it
seems
strange
that
people
should
marvel
at
what
is
really
so
simple
why
it
is
as
easy
to
teach
the
name
of
an
idea
if
it
is
clearly
formulated
in
the
child
mind
as
to
teach
the
name
of
an
object
it
would
indeed
be
a
herculean
task
to
teach
the
words
if
the
ideas
did
not
already
exist
in
the
child
mind
if
his
experiences
and
observations
had
led
him
to
the
concepts
small
large
good
bad
sweet
sour
he
would
have
nothing
to
attach
the
to
i
little
ignorant
i
found
myself
explaining
to
the
wise
men
of
the
east
and
the
west
such
simple
things
as
these
if
you
give
a
child
something
sweet
and
he
wags
his
tongue
and
smacks
his
lips
and
looks
pleased
he
has
a
very
definite
sensation
and
if
every
time
he
has
this
experience
he
hears
the
word
sweet
or
has
it
spelled
into
his
hand
he
will
quickly
adopt
this
arbitrary
sign
for
his
sensation
likewise
if
you
put
a
bit
of
lemon
on
his
tongue
he
puckers
up
his
lips
and
tries
to
spit
it
out
and
after
he
has
had
this
experience
a
few
times
if
you
offer
him
a
lemon
he
shuts
his
mouth
and
makes
faces
clearly
indicating
that
he
remembers
the
unpleasant
sensation
you
label
it
sour
and
he
adopts
your
symbol
if
you
had
called
these
sensations
respectively
black
and
white
he
would
have
adopted
them
as
readily
but
he
would
mean
by
black
and
white
the
same
things
that
he
means
by
sweet
and
sour
in
the
same
way
the
child
learns
from
many
experiences
to
differentiate
his
feelings
and
we
name
them
for
him
good
bad
gentle
rough
happy
sad
it
is
not
the
word
but
the
capacity
to
experience
the
sensation
that
counts
in
his
education
this
extract
from
one
of
miss
sullivan
letters
is
added
because
it
contains
interesting
casual
opinions
stimulated
by
observing
the
methods
of
others
we
visited
a
little
school
for
the
deaf
we
were
very
kindly
received
and
helen
enjoyed
meeting
the
children
two
of
the
teachers
knew
the
manual
alphabet
and
talked
to
her
without
an
interpreter
they
were
astonished
at
her
command
of
language
not
a
child
in
the
school
they
said
had
anything
like
helen
facility
of
expression
and
some
of
them
had
been
under
instruction
for
two
or
three
years
i
was
incredulous
at
first
but
after
i
had
watched
the
children
at
work
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
knew
that
what
i
had
been
told
was
true
and
i
surprised
in
one
room
some
little
tots
were
standing
before
the
blackboard
painfully
constructing
simple
sentences
a
little
girl
had
written
i
have
a
new
dress
it
is
a
pretty
dress
my
mamma
made
my
pretty
new
dress
i
love
mamma
a
little
boy
was
writing
i
have
a
large
ball
i
like
to
kick
my
large
ball
when
we
entered
the
room
the
children
attention
was
riveted
on
helen
one
of
them
pulled
me
by
the
sleeve
and
said
girl
is
blind
the
teacher
was
writing
on
the
blackboard
the
girl
name
is
helen
she
is
deaf
she
can
not
see
we
are
very
sorry
i
said
why
do
you
write
those
sentences
on
the
board
would
the
children
understand
if
you
talked
to
them
about
helen
the
teacher
said
something
about
getting
the
correct
construction
and
continued
to
construct
an
exercise
out
of
helen
i
asked
her
if
the
little
girl
who
had
written
about
the
new
dress
was
particularly
pleased
with
her
dress
no
she
replied
i
think
not
but
children
learn
better
if
they
write
about
things
that
concern
them
personally
it
seemed
all
so
mechanical
and
difficult
my
heart
ached
for
the
poor
little
children
nobody
thinks
of
making
a
hearing
child
say
i
have
a
pretty
new
dress
at
the
beginning
these
children
were
older
in
years
it
is
true
than
the
baby
who
lisps
papa
kiss
baby
pretty
and
fills
out
her
meaning
by
pointing
to
her
new
dress
but
their
ability
to
understand
and
use
language
was
no
greater
there
was
the
same
difficulty
throughout
the
school
in
every
classroom
i
saw
sentences
on
the
blackboard
which
evidently
had
been
written
to
illustrate
some
grammatical
rule
or
for
the
purpose
of
using
words
that
had
previously
been
taught
in
the
same
or
in
some
other
connection
this
sort
of
thing
may
be
necessary
in
some
stages
of
education
but
it
is
the
way
to
acquire
language
nothing
i
think
crushes
the
child
impulse
to
talk
naturally
more
effectually
than
these
blackboard
exercises
the
schoolroom
is
not
the
place
to
teach
any
young
child
language
least
of
all
the
deaf
child
he
must
be
kept
as
unconscious
as
the
hearing
child
of
the
fact
that
he
is
learning
words
and
he
should
be
allowed
to
prattle
on
his
fingers
or
with
his
pencil
in
monosyllables
if
he
chooses
until
such
time
as
his
growing
intelligence
demands
the
sentence
language
should
not
be
associated
in
his
mind
with
endless
hours
in
school
with
puzzling
questions
in
grammar
or
with
anything
that
is
an
enemy
to
joy
but
i
must
not
get
into
the
habit
of
criticizing
other
people
methods
too
severely
i
may
be
as
far
from
the
straight
road
as
they
miss
sullivan
second
report
brings
the
account
down
to
october
during
the
past
year
helen
has
enjoyed
excellent
health
her
eyes
and
ears
have
been
examined
by
specialists
and
it
is
their
opinion
that
she
can
not
have
the
slightest
perception
of
either
light
or
sound
it
is
impossible
to
tell
exactly
to
what
extent
the
senses
of
smell
and
taste
aid
her
in
gaining
information
respecting
physical
qualities
but
according
to
eminent
authority
these
senses
do
exert
a
great
influence
on
the
mental
and
moral
development
dugald
stewart
says
some
of
the
most
significant
words
relating
to
the
human
mind
are
borrowed
from
the
sense
of
smell
and
the
conspicuous
place
which
its
sensations
occupy
in
the
poetical
language
of
all
nations
shows
how
easily
and
naturally
they
ally
themselves
with
the
refined
operations
of
the
fancy
and
the
moral
emotions
of
the
heart
helen
certainly
derives
great
pleasure
from
the
exercise
of
these
senses
on
entering
a
greenhouse
her
countenance
becomes
radiant
and
she
will
tell
the
names
of
the
flowers
with
which
she
is
familiar
by
the
sense
of
smell
alone
her
recollections
of
the
sensations
of
smell
are
very
vivid
she
enjoys
in
anticipation
the
scent
of
a
rose
or
a
violet
and
if
she
is
promised
a
bouquet
of
these
flowers
a
peculiarly
happy
expression
lights
her
face
indicating
that
in
imagination
she
perceives
their
fragrance
and
that
it
is
pleasant
to
her
it
frequently
happens
that
the
perfume
of
a
flower
or
the
flavour
of
a
fruit
recalls
to
her
mind
some
happy
event
in
home
life
or
a
delightful
birthday
party
her
sense
of
touch
has
sensibly
increased
during
the
year
and
has
gained
in
acuteness
and
delicacy
indeed
her
whole
body
is
so
finely
organized
that
she
seems
to
use
it
as
a
medium
for
bringing
herself
into
closer
relations
with
her
fellow
creatures
she
is
able
not
only
to
distinguish
with
great
accuracy
the
different
undulations
of
the
air
and
the
vibrations
of
the
floor
made
by
various
sounds
and
motions
and
to
recognize
her
friends
and
acquaintances
the
instant
she
touches
their
hands
or
clothing
but
she
also
perceives
the
state
of
mind
of
those
around
her
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
with
whom
helen
is
conversing
to
be
particularly
happy
or
sad
and
withhold
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
from
her
she
observes
the
slightest
emphasis
placed
upon
a
word
in
conversation
and
she
discovers
meaning
in
every
change
of
position
and
in
the
varied
play
of
the
muscles
of
the
hand
she
responds
quickly
to
the
gentle
pressure
of
affection
the
pat
of
approval
the
jerk
of
impatience
the
firm
motion
of
command
and
to
the
many
other
variations
of
the
almost
infinite
language
of
the
feelings
and
she
has
become
so
expert
in
interpreting
this
unconscious
language
of
the
emotions
that
she
is
often
able
to
divine
our
very
thoughts
in
my
account
of
helen
last
year
i
mentioned
several
instances
where
she
seemed
to
have
called
into
use
an
inexplicable
mental
faculty
but
it
now
seems
to
me
after
carefully
considering
the
matter
that
this
power
may
be
explained
by
her
perfect
familiarity
with
the
muscular
variations
of
those
with
whom
she
comes
into
contact
caused
by
their
emotions
she
has
been
forced
to
depend
largely
upon
this
muscular
sense
as
a
means
of
ascertaining
the
mental
condition
of
those
about
her
she
has
learned
to
connect
certain
movements
of
the
body
with
anger
others
with
joy
and
others
still
with
sorrow
one
day
while
she
was
out
walking
with
her
mother
and
anagnos
a
boy
threw
a
torpedo
which
startled
keller
helen
felt
the
change
in
her
mother
movements
instantly
and
asked
what
are
we
afraid
of
on
one
occasion
while
walking
on
the
common
with
her
i
saw
a
police
officer
taking
a
man
to
the
the
agitation
which
i
felt
evidently
produced
a
perceptible
physical
change
for
helen
asked
excitedly
what
do
you
see
a
striking
illustration
of
this
strange
power
was
recently
shown
while
her
ears
were
being
examined
by
the
aurists
in
cincinnati
several
experiments
were
tried
to
determine
positively
whether
or
not
she
had
any
perception
of
sound
all
present
were
astonished
when
she
appeared
not
only
to
hear
a
whistle
but
also
an
ordinary
tone
of
voice
she
would
turn
her
head
smile
and
act
as
though
she
had
heard
what
was
said
i
was
then
standing
beside
her
holding
her
hand
thinking
that
she
was
receiving
impressions
from
me
i
put
her
hands
upon
the
table
and
withdrew
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
the
aurists
then
tried
their
experiments
with
quite
different
results
helen
remained
motionless
through
them
all
not
once
showing
the
least
sign
that
she
realized
what
was
going
on
at
my
suggestion
one
of
the
gentlemen
took
her
hand
and
the
tests
were
repeated
this
time
her
countenance
changed
whenever
she
was
spoken
to
but
there
was
not
such
a
decided
lighting
up
of
the
features
as
when
i
had
held
her
hand
in
the
account
of
helen
last
year
it
was
stated
that
she
knew
nothing
about
death
or
the
burial
of
the
body
yet
on
entering
a
cemetery
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
showed
signs
of
emotion
her
eyes
actually
filling
with
tears
a
circumstance
equally
remarkable
occurred
last
summer
but
before
relating
it
i
will
mention
what
she
now
knows
with
regard
to
death
even
before
i
knew
her
she
had
handled
a
dead
chicken
or
bird
or
some
other
small
animal
some
time
after
the
visit
to
the
cemetery
before
referred
to
helen
became
interested
in
a
horse
that
had
met
with
an
accident
by
which
one
of
his
legs
had
been
badly
injured
and
she
went
daily
with
me
to
visit
him
the
wounded
leg
soon
became
so
much
worse
that
the
horse
was
suspended
from
a
beam
the
animal
groaned
with
pain
and
helen
perceiving
his
groans
was
filled
with
pity
at
last
it
became
necessary
to
kill
him
and
when
helen
next
asked
to
go
and
see
him
i
told
her
that
he
was
dead
this
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
heard
the
word
i
then
explained
that
he
had
been
shot
to
relieve
him
from
suffering
and
that
he
was
now
buried
put
into
the
ground
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
idea
of
his
having
been
intentionally
shot
did
not
make
much
impression
upon
her
but
i
think
she
did
realize
the
fact
that
life
was
extinct
in
the
horse
as
in
the
dead
birds
she
had
touched
and
also
that
he
had
been
put
into
the
ground
since
this
occurrence
i
have
used
the
word
dead
whenever
occasion
required
but
with
no
further
explanation
of
its
meaning
while
making
a
visit
at
brewster
massachusetts
she
one
day
accompanied
my
friend
and
me
through
the
graveyard
she
examined
one
stone
after
another
and
seemed
pleased
when
she
could
decipher
a
name
she
smelt
of
the
flowers
but
showed
no
desire
to
pluck
them
and
when
i
gathered
a
few
for
her
she
refused
to
have
them
pinned
on
her
dress
when
her
attention
was
drawn
to
a
marble
slab
inscribed
with
the
name
florence
in
relief
she
dropped
upon
the
ground
as
though
looking
for
something
then
turned
to
me
with
a
face
full
of
trouble
and
asked
were
is
poor
little
florence
i
evaded
the
question
but
she
persisted
turning
to
my
friend
she
asked
did
you
cry
loud
for
poor
little
florence
then
she
added
i
think
she
is
very
dead
who
put
her
in
big
hole
as
she
continued
to
ask
these
distressing
questions
we
left
the
cemetery
florence
was
the
daughter
of
my
friend
and
was
a
young
lady
at
the
time
of
her
death
but
helen
had
been
told
nothing
about
her
nor
did
she
even
know
that
my
friend
had
had
a
daughter
helen
had
been
given
a
bed
and
carriage
for
her
dolls
which
she
had
received
and
used
like
any
other
gift
on
her
return
to
the
house
after
her
visit
to
the
cemetery
she
ran
to
the
closet
where
these
toys
were
kept
and
carried
them
to
my
friend
saying
they
are
poor
little
florence
this
was
true
although
we
were
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
she
guessed
it
a
letter
written
to
her
mother
in
the
course
of
the
following
week
gave
an
account
of
her
impression
in
her
own
words
i
put
my
little
babies
to
sleep
in
florence
little
bed
and
i
take
them
to
ride
in
her
carriage
poor
little
florence
is
dead
she
was
very
sick
and
died
did
cry
loud
for
her
dear
little
child
she
got
in
the
ground
and
she
is
very
dirty
and
she
is
cold
florence
was
very
lovely
like
sadie
and
kissed
her
and
hugged
her
much
florence
is
very
sad
in
big
hole
doctor
gave
her
medicine
to
make
her
well
but
poor
florence
did
not
get
well
when
she
was
very
sick
she
tossed
and
moaned
in
bed
will
go
to
see
her
soon
notwithstanding
the
activity
of
helen
mind
she
is
a
very
natural
child
she
is
fond
of
fun
and
frolic
and
loves
dearly
to
be
with
other
children
she
is
never
fretful
or
irritable
and
i
have
never
seen
her
impatient
with
her
playmates
because
they
failed
to
understand
her
she
will
play
for
hours
together
with
children
who
can
not
understand
a
single
word
she
spells
and
it
is
pathetic
to
watch
the
eager
gestures
and
excited
pantomime
through
which
her
ideas
and
emotions
find
expression
occasionally
some
little
boy
or
girl
will
try
to
learn
the
manual
alphabet
then
it
is
beautiful
to
observe
with
what
patience
sweetness
and
perseverance
helen
endeavours
to
bring
the
unruly
fingers
of
her
little
friend
into
proper
position
one
day
while
helen
was
wearing
a
little
jacket
of
which
she
was
very
proud
her
mother
said
there
is
a
poor
little
girl
who
has
no
cloak
to
keep
her
warm
will
you
give
her
yours
helen
began
to
pull
off
the
jacket
saying
i
must
give
it
to
a
poor
little
strange
girl
she
is
very
fond
of
children
younger
than
herself
and
a
baby
invariably
calls
forth
all
the
motherly
instincts
of
her
nature
she
will
handle
the
baby
as
tenderly
as
the
most
careful
nurse
could
desire
it
is
pleasant
too
to
note
her
thoughtfulness
for
little
children
and
her
readiness
to
yield
to
their
whims
she
has
a
very
sociable
disposition
and
delights
in
the
companionship
of
those
who
can
follow
the
rapid
motions
of
her
fingers
but
if
left
alone
she
will
amuse
herself
for
hours
at
a
time
with
her
knitting
or
sewing
she
reads
a
great
deal
she
bends
over
her
book
with
a
look
of
intense
interest
and
as
the
forefinger
of
her
left
hand
runs
along
the
line
she
spells
out
the
words
with
the
other
hand
but
often
her
motions
are
so
rapid
as
to
be
unintelligible
even
to
those
accustomed
to
reading
the
swift
and
varied
movements
of
her
fingers
every
shade
of
feeling
finds
expression
through
her
mobile
features
her
behaviour
is
easy
and
natural
and
it
is
charming
because
of
its
frankness
and
evident
sincerity
her
heart
is
too
full
of
unselfishness
and
affection
to
allow
a
dream
of
fear
or
unkindness
she
does
not
realize
that
one
can
be
anything
but
and
tender
she
is
not
conscious
of
any
reason
why
she
should
be
awkward
consequently
her
movements
are
free
and
graceful
she
is
very
fond
of
all
the
living
things
at
home
and
she
will
not
have
them
unkindly
treated
when
she
is
riding
in
the
carriage
she
will
not
allow
the
driver
to
use
the
whip
because
she
says
poor
horses
will
cry
one
morning
she
was
greatly
distressed
by
finding
that
one
of
the
dogs
had
a
block
fastened
to
her
collar
we
explained
that
it
was
done
to
keep
pearl
from
running
away
helen
expressed
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
and
at
every
opportunity
during
the
day
she
would
find
pearl
and
carry
the
burden
from
place
to
place
her
father
wrote
to
her
last
summer
that
the
birds
and
bees
were
eating
all
his
grapes
at
first
she
was
very
indignant
and
said
the
little
creatures
were
very
wrong
but
she
seemed
pleased
when
i
explained
to
her
that
the
birds
and
bees
were
hungry
and
did
not
know
that
it
was
selfish
to
eat
all
the
fruit
in
a
letter
written
soon
afterward
she
says
i
am
very
sorry
that
bumblebees
and
hornets
and
birds
and
large
flies
and
worms
are
eating
all
of
my
father
delicious
grapes
they
like
juicy
fruit
to
eat
as
well
as
people
and
they
are
hungry
they
are
not
very
wrong
to
eat
too
many
grapes
because
they
do
not
know
much
she
continues
to
make
rapid
progress
in
the
acquisition
of
language
as
her
experiences
increase
while
these
were
few
and
elementary
her
vocabulary
was
necessarily
limited
but
as
she
learns
more
of
the
world
about
her
her
judgment
grows
more
accurate
her
reasoning
powers
grow
stronger
more
active
and
subtle
and
the
language
by
which
she
expresses
this
intellectual
activity
gains
in
fluency
and
logic
when
traveling
she
drinks
in
thought
and
language
sitting
beside
her
in
the
car
i
describe
what
i
see
from
the
window
hills
and
valleys
and
the
rivers
and
gardens
in
which
strawberries
peaches
pears
melons
and
vegetables
are
growing
herds
of
cows
and
horses
feeding
in
broad
meadows
and
flocks
of
sheep
on
the
hillside
the
cities
with
their
churches
and
schools
hotels
and
warehouses
and
the
occupations
of
the
busy
people
while
i
am
communicating
these
things
helen
manifests
intense
interest
and
in
default
of
words
she
indicates
by
gestures
and
pantomime
her
desire
to
learn
more
of
her
surroundings
and
of
the
great
forces
which
are
operating
everywhere
in
this
way
she
learns
countless
new
expressions
without
any
apparent
effort
from
the
day
when
helen
first
grasped
the
idea
that
all
objects
have
names
and
that
these
can
be
communicated
by
certain
movements
of
the
fingers
i
have
talked
to
her
exactly
as
i
should
have
done
had
she
been
able
to
hear
with
only
this
exception
that
i
have
addressed
the
words
to
her
fingers
instead
of
to
her
ears
naturally
there
was
at
first
a
strong
tendency
on
her
part
to
use
only
the
important
words
in
a
sentence
she
would
say
helen
milk
i
got
the
milk
to
show
her
that
she
had
used
the
correct
word
but
i
did
not
let
her
drink
it
until
she
had
with
my
assistance
made
a
complete
sentence
as
give
helen
some
milk
to
drink
in
these
early
lessons
i
encouraged
her
in
the
use
of
different
forms
of
expression
for
conveying
the
same
idea
if
she
was
eating
some
candy
i
said
will
helen
please
give
teacher
some
candy
or
teacher
would
like
to
eat
some
of
helen
candy
emphasizing
the
she
very
soon
perceived
that
the
same
idea
could
be
expressed
in
a
great
many
ways
in
two
or
three
months
after
i
began
to
teach
her
she
would
say
helen
wants
to
go
to
bed
or
helen
is
sleepy
and
helen
will
go
to
bed
i
am
constantly
asked
the
question
how
did
you
teach
her
the
meaning
of
words
expressive
of
intellectual
and
moral
qualities
i
believe
it
was
more
through
association
and
repetition
than
through
any
explanation
of
mine
this
is
especially
true
of
her
earlier
lessons
when
her
knowledge
of
language
was
so
slight
as
to
make
explanation
impossible
i
always
made
it
a
practice
to
use
the
words
descriptive
of
emotions
of
intellectual
or
moral
qualities
and
actions
in
connection
with
the
circumstance
which
required
these
words
soon
after
i
became
her
teacher
helen
broke
her
new
doll
of
which
she
was
very
fond
she
began
to
cry
i
said
to
her
teacher
is
sorry
after
a
few
repetitions
she
came
to
associate
the
word
with
the
feeling
the
word
happy
she
learned
in
the
same
way
also
right
wrong
good
bad
and
other
adjectives
the
word
love
she
learned
as
other
children
do
by
its
association
with
caresses
one
day
i
asked
her
a
simple
question
in
a
combination
of
numbers
which
i
was
sure
she
knew
she
answered
at
random
i
checked
her
and
she
stood
still
the
expression
of
her
face
plainly
showing
that
she
was
trying
to
think
i
touched
her
forehead
and
spelled
the
word
thus
connected
with
the
act
seemed
to
impress
itself
on
her
mind
much
as
if
i
had
placed
her
hand
upon
an
object
and
then
spelled
its
name
since
that
time
she
has
always
used
the
word
think
at
a
later
period
i
began
to
use
such
words
as
perhaps
suppose
expect
forget
remember
if
helen
asked
where
is
mother
now
i
replied
i
do
not
know
perhaps
she
is
with
leila
she
is
always
anxious
to
learn
the
names
of
people
we
meet
in
the
or
elsewhere
and
to
know
where
they
are
going
and
what
they
will
do
conversations
of
this
kind
are
frequent
helen
what
is
little
boy
name
teacher
i
do
not
know
for
he
is
a
little
stranger
but
perhaps
his
name
is
jack
helen
where
is
he
going
teacher
he
may
be
going
to
the
common
to
have
fun
with
other
boys
helen
what
will
he
play
teacher
i
suppose
he
will
play
ball
helen
what
are
boys
doing
now
teacher
perhaps
they
are
expecting
jack
and
are
waiting
for
him
after
the
words
have
become
familiar
to
her
she
uses
them
in
composition
september
this
morning
teacher
and
i
sat
by
the
window
and
we
saw
a
little
boy
walking
on
the
sidewalk
it
was
raining
very
hard
and
he
had
a
very
large
umbrella
to
keep
off
the
i
do
not
know
how
old
he
was
but
think
he
may
have
been
six
years
old
perhaps
his
name
was
joe
i
do
not
know
where
he
was
going
because
he
was
a
little
strange
boy
but
perhaps
his
mother
sent
him
to
a
store
to
buy
something
for
dinner
he
had
a
bag
in
one
hand
i
suppose
he
was
going
to
take
it
to
his
mother
in
teaching
her
the
use
of
language
i
have
not
confined
myself
to
any
particular
theory
or
system
i
have
observed
the
spontaneous
movements
of
my
pupil
mind
and
have
tried
to
follow
the
suggestions
thus
given
to
me
owing
to
the
nervousness
of
helen
temperament
every
precaution
has
been
taken
to
avoid
unduly
exciting
her
already
very
active
brain
the
greater
part
of
the
year
has
been
spent
in
travel
and
in
visits
to
different
places
and
her
lessons
have
been
those
suggested
by
the
various
scenes
and
experiences
through
which
she
has
passed
she
continues
to
manifest
the
same
eagerness
to
learn
as
at
first
it
is
never
necessary
to
urge
her
to
study
indeed
i
am
often
obliged
to
coax
her
to
leave
an
example
or
a
composition
while
not
confining
myself
to
any
special
system
of
instruction
i
have
tried
to
add
to
her
general
information
and
intelligence
to
enlarge
her
acquaintance
with
things
around
her
and
to
bring
her
into
easy
and
natural
relations
with
people
i
have
encouraged
her
to
keep
a
diary
from
which
the
following
selection
has
been
made

little

i
am
tired
and
teacher
does
not
want
me
to
write
more
in
the
autumn
she
went
to
a
circus
while
we
were
standing
before
his
cage
the
lion
roared
and
helen
felt
the
vibration
of
the
air
so
distinctly
that
she
was
able
to
reproduce
the
noise
quite
accurately
i
tried
to
describe
to
her
the
appearance
of
a
camel
but
as
we
were
not
allowed
to
touch
the
animal
i
feared
that
she
did
not
get
a
correct
idea
of
its
shape
a
few
days
afterward
however
hearing
a
commotion
in
the
schoolroom
i
went
in
and
found
helen
on
all
fours
with
a
pillow
so
strapped
upon
her
back
as
to
leave
a
hollow
in
the
middle
thus
making
a
hump
on
either
side
between
these
humps
she
had
placed
her
doll
which
she
was
giving
a
ride
around
the
room
i
watched
her
for
some
time
as
she
moved
about
trying
to
take
long
strides
in
order
to
carry
out
the
idea
i
had
given
her
of
a
camel
gait
when
i
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
she
replied
i
am
a
very
funny
camel
during
the
next
two
years
neither
anagnos
who
was
in
europe
for
a
year
nor
miss
sullivan
wrote
anything
about
helen
keller
for
publication
in
appeared
the
perkins
institution
report
for
containing
a
full
account
of
helen
keller
including
many
of
her
letters
exercises
and
compositions
as
some
of
the
letters
and
the
story
of
the
frost
king
are
published
here
there
is
no
need
of
printing
any
more
samples
of
helen
keller
writing
during
the
third
fourth
and
fifth
years
of
her
education
it
was
the
first
two
years
that
counted
from
miss
sullivan
part
of
this
report
i
give
her
most
important
comments
and
such
biographical
matter
as
does
not
appear
elsewhere
in
the
present
volume
these
extracts
anagnos
took
from
miss
sullivan
notes
and
memoranda
one
day
while
her
pony
and
her
donkey
were
standing
side
by
side
helen
went
from
one
to
the
other
examining
them
closely
at
last
she
paused
with
her
hand
upon
neddy
head
and
addressed
him
thus
yes
dear
neddy
it
is
true
that
you
are
not
as
beautiful
as
black
beauty
your
body
is
not
so
handsomely
formed
and
there
is
no
proud
look
in
your
face
and
your
neck
does
not
arch
besides
your
long
ears
make
you
look
a
little
funny
of
course
you
can
not
help
it
and
i
love
you
just
as
well
as
if
you
were
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
helen
has
been
greatly
interested
in
the
story
of
black
beauty
to
show
how
quickly
she
perceives
and
associates
ideas
i
will
give
an
instance
which
all
who
have
read
the
book
will
be
able
to
appreciate
i
was
reading
the
following
paragraph
to
her
the
horse
was
an
old
chestnut
with
an
coat
and
bones
that
showed
plainly
through
it
the
knees
knuckled
over
and
the
forelegs
were
very
unsteady
i
had
been
eating
some
hay
and
the
wind
rolled
a
little
lock
of
it
that
way
and
the
poor
creature
put
out
her
long
thin
neck
and
picked
it
up
and
then
turned
round
and
looked
about
for
more
there
was
a
hopeless
look
in
the
dull
eye
that
i
could
not
help
noticing
and
then
as
i
was
thinking
where
i
had
seen
that
horse
before
she
looked
full
at
me
and
said
beauty
is
that
you
at
this
point
helen
pressed
my
hand
to
stop
me
she
was
sobbing
convulsively
it
was
poor
ginger
was
all
she
could
say
at
first
later
when
she
was
able
to
talk
about
it
she
said
poor
ginger
the
words
made
a
distinct
picture
in
my
mind
i
could
see
the
way
ginger
looked
all
her
beauty
gone
her
beautiful
arched
neck
drooping
all
the
spirit
gone
out
of
her
flashing
eyes
all
the
playfulness
gone
out
of
her
manner
oh
how
terrible
it
was
i
never
knew
before
that
there
could
be
such
a
change
in
anything
there
were
very
few
spots
of
sunshine
in
poor
ginger
life
and
the
sadnesses
were
so
many
after
a
moment
she
added
mournfully
i
fear
some
people
lives
are
just
like
ginger
this
morning
helen
was
reading
for
the
first
time
bryant
poem
oh
mother
of
a
mighty
race
i
said
to
her
tell
me
when
you
have
read
the
poem
through
who
you
think
the
mother
is
when
she
came
to
the
line
there
freedom
at
thy
gates
and
rest
she
exclaimed
it
means
america
the
gate
i
suppose
is
new
york
city
and
freedom
is
the
great
statue
of
liberty
after
she
had
read
the
battlefield
by
the
same
author
i
asked
her
which
verse
she
thought
was
the
most
beautiful
she
replied
i
like
this
verse
best
crushed
to
earth
shall
rise
again
the
eternal
years
of
god
are
hers
but
error
wounded
writhes
with
pain
and
dies
among
his
worshipers
she
is
at
once
transported
into
the
midst
of
the
events
of
a
story
she
rejoices
when
justice
wins
she
is
sad
when
virtue
lies
low
and
her
face
glows
with
admiration
and
reverence
when
heroic
deeds
are
described
she
even
enters
into
the
spirit
of
battle
she
says
i
think
it
is
right
for
men
to
fight
against
wrongs
and
tyrants
here
begins
miss
sullivan
connected
account
in
the
report
of
during
the
past
three
years
helen
has
continued
to
make
rapid
progress
in
the
acquisition
of
language
she
has
one
advantage
over
ordinary
children
that
nothing
from
without
distracts
her
attention
from
her
studies
but
this
advantage
involves
a
corresponding
disadvantage
the
danger
of
unduly
severe
mental
application
her
mind
is
so
constituted
that
she
is
in
a
state
of
feverish
unrest
while
conscious
that
there
is
something
that
she
does
not
comprehend
i
have
never
known
her
to
be
willing
to
leave
a
lesson
when
she
felt
that
there
was
anything
in
it
which
she
did
not
understand
if
i
suggest
her
leaving
a
problem
in
arithmetic
until
the
next
day
she
answers
i
think
it
will
make
my
mind
stronger
to
do
it
now
a
few
evenings
ago
we
were
discussing
the
tariff
helen
wanted
me
to
tell
her
about
it
i
said
no
you
can
not
understand
it
yet
she
was
quiet
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
with
spirit
how
do
you
know
that
i
can
not
understand
i
have
a
good
mind
you
must
remember
dear
teacher
that
greek
parents
were
very
particular
with
their
children
and
they
used
to
let
them
listen
to
wise
words
and
i
think
they
understood
some
of
them
i
have
found
it
best
not
to
tell
her
that
she
can
not
understand
because
she
is
almost
certain
to
become
excited
not
long
ago
i
tried
to
show
her
how
to
build
a
tower
with
her
blocks
as
the
design
was
somewhat
complicated
the
slightest
jar
made
the
structure
fall
after
a
time
i
became
discouraged
and
told
her
i
was
afraid
she
could
not
make
it
stand
but
that
i
would
build
it
for
her
but
she
did
not
approve
of
this
plan
she
was
determined
to
build
the
tower
herself
and
for
nearly
three
hours
she
worked
away
patiently
gathering
up
the
blocks
whenever
they
fell
and
beginning
over
again
until
at
last
her
perseverance
was
crowned
with
success
the
tower
stood
complete
in
every
part
until
october
i
had
not
deemed
it
best
to
confine
helen
to
any
regular
and
systematic
course
of
study
for
the
first
two
years
of
her
intellectual
life
she
was
like
a
child
in
a
strange
country
where
everything
was
new
and
perplexing
and
until
she
gained
a
knowledge
of
language
it
was
not
possible
to
give
her
a
definite
course
of
instruction
moreover
helen
inquisitiveness
was
so
great
during
these
years
that
it
would
have
interfered
with
her
progress
in
the
acquisition
of
language
if
a
consideration
of
the
questions
which
were
constantly
occurring
to
her
had
been
deferred
until
the
completion
of
a
lesson
in
all
probability
she
would
have
forgotten
the
question
and
a
good
opportunity
to
explain
something
of
real
interest
to
her
would
have
been
lost
therefore
it
has
always
seemed
best
to
me
to
teach
anything
whenever
my
pupil
needed
to
know
it
whether
it
had
any
bearing
on
the
projected
lesson
or
not
her
inquiries
have
often
led
us
far
away
from
the
subject
under
immediate
consideration
since
october
her
work
has
been
more
regular
and
has
included
arithmetic
geography
zoology
botany
and
reading
she
has
made
considerable
progress
in
the
study
of
arithmetic
she
readily
explains
the
processes
of
multiplication
addition
subtraction
and
division
and
seems
to
understand
the
operations
she
has
nearly
finished
colburn
mental
arithmetic
her
last
work
being
in
improper
fractions
she
has
also
done
some
good
work
in
written
arithmetic
her
mind
works
so
rapidly
that
it
often
happens
that
when
i
give
her
an
example
she
will
give
me
the
correct
answer
before
i
have
time
to
write
out
the
question
she
pays
little
attention
to
the
language
used
in
stating
a
problem
and
seldom
stops
to
ask
the
meaning
of
unknown
words
or
phrases
until
she
is
ready
to
explain
her
work
once
when
a
question
puzzled
her
very
much
i
suggested
that
we
take
a
walk
and
then
perhaps
she
would
understand
it
she
shook
her
head
decidedly
and
said
my
enemies
would
think
i
was
running
away
i
must
stay
and
conquer
them
now
and
she
did
the
intellectual
improvement
which
helen
has
made
in
the
past
two
years
is
shown
more
clearly
in
her
greater
command
of
language
and
in
her
ability
to
recognize
nicer
shades
of
meaning
in
the
use
of
words
than
in
any
other
branch
of
her
education
not
a
day
passes
that
she
does
not
learn
many
new
words
nor
are
these
merely
the
names
of
tangible
and
sensible
objects
for
instance
she
one
day
wished
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
following
words
phenomenon
comprise
energy
reproduction
extraordinary
perpetual
and
mystery
some
of
these
words
have
successive
steps
of
meaning
beginning
with
what
is
simple
and
leading
on
to
what
is
abstract
it
would
have
been
a
hopeless
task
to
make
helen
comprehend
the
more
abstruse
meanings
of
the
word
mystery
but
she
understood
readily
that
it
signified
something
hidden
or
concealed
and
when
she
makes
greater
progress
she
will
grasp
its
more
abstruse
meaning
as
easily
as
she
now
does
the
simpler
signification
in
investigating
any
subject
there
must
occur
at
the
beginning
words
and
phrases
which
can
not
be
adequately
understood
until
the
pupil
has
made
considerable
advancement
yet
i
have
thought
it
best
to
go
on
giving
my
pupil
simple
definitions
thinking
that
although
these
may
be
somewhat
vague
and
provisional
they
will
come
to
one
another
assistance
and
that
what
is
obscure
will
be
plain
i
regard
my
pupil
as
a
free
and
active
being
whose
own
spontaneous
impulses
must
be
my
surest
guide
i
have
always
talked
to
helen
exactly
as
i
would
talk
to
a
seeing
and
hearing
child
and
i
have
insisted
that
other
people
should
do
the
same
whenever
any
one
asks
me
if
she
will
understand
this
or
that
word
i
always
reply
never
mind
whether
she
understands
each
separate
word
of
a
sentence
or
not
she
will
guess
the
meanings
of
the
new
words
from
their
connection
with
others
which
are
already
intelligible
to
her
in
selecting
books
for
helen
to
read
i
have
never
chosen
them
with
reference
to
her
deafness
and
blindness
she
always
reads
such
books
as
seeing
and
hearing
children
of
her
age
read
and
enjoy
of
course
in
the
beginning
it
was
necessary
that
the
things
described
should
be
familiar
and
interesting
and
the
english
pure
and
simple
i
remember
distinctly
when
she
first
attempted
to
read
a
little
story
she
had
learned
the
printed
letters
and
for
some
time
had
amused
herself
by
making
simple
sentences
using
slips
on
which
the
words
were
printed
in
raised
letters
but
these
sentences
had
no
special
relation
to
one
another
one
morning
we
caught
a
mouse
and
it
occurred
to
me
with
a
live
mouse
and
a
live
cat
to
stimulate
her
interest
that
i
might
arrange
some
sentences
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
little
story
and
thus
give
her
a
new
conception
of
the
use
of
language
so
i
put
the
following
sentences
in
the
frame
and
gave
it
to
helen
the
cat
is
on
the
box
a
mouse
is
in
the
box
the
cat
can
see
the
mouse
the
cat
would
like
to
eat
the
mouse
do
not
let
the
cat
get
the
mouse
the
cat
can
have
some
milk
and
the
mouse
can
have
some
cake
the
word
the
she
did
not
know
and
of
course
she
wished
it
explained
at
that
stage
of
her
advancement
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
explain
its
use
and
so
i
did
not
try
but
moved
her
finger
on
to
the
next
word
which
she
recognized
with
a
bright
smile
then
as
i
put
her
hand
upon
puss
sitting
on
the
box
she
made
a
little
exclamation
of
surprise
and
the
rest
of
the
sentence
became
perfectly
clear
to
her
when
she
had
read
the
words
of
the
second
sentence
i
showed
her
that
there
really
was
a
mouse
in
the
box
she
then
moved
her
finger
to
the
next
line
with
an
expression
of
eager
interest
the
cat
can
see
the
mouse
here
i
made
the
cat
look
at
the
mouse
and
let
helen
feel
the
cat
the
expression
of
the
little
countenance
showed
that
she
was
perplexed
i
called
her
attention
to
the
following
line
and
although
she
knew
only
the
three
words
cat
eat
and
mouse
she
caught
the
idea
she
pulled
the
cat
away
and
put
her
on
the
floor
at
the
same
time
covering
the
box
with
the
frame
when
she
read
do
not
let
the
cat
get
the
mouse
she
recognized
the
negation
in
the
sentence
and
seemed
to
know
that
the
cat
must
not
get
the
mouse
get
and
let
were
new
words
she
was
familiar
with
the
words
of
the
last
sentence
and
was
delighted
when
allowed
to
act
them
out
by
signs
she
made
me
understand
that
she
wished
another
story
and
i
gave
her
a
book
containing
very
short
stories
written
in
the
most
elementary
style
she
ran
her
fingers
along
the
lines
finding
the
words
she
knew
and
guessing
at
the
meaning
of
others
in
a
way
that
would
convince
the
most
conservative
of
educators
that
a
little
deaf
child
if
given
the
opportunity
will
learn
to
read
as
easily
and
naturally
as
ordinary
children
i
am
convinced
that
helen
use
of
english
is
due
largely
to
her
familiarity
with
books
she
often
reads
for
two
or
three
hours
in
succession
and
then
lays
aside
her
book
reluctantly
one
day
as
we
left
the
library
i
noticed
that
she
appeared
more
serious
than
usual
and
i
asked
the
cause
i
am
thinking
how
much
wiser
we
always
are
when
we
leave
here
than
we
are
when
we
come
was
her
reply
when
asked
why
she
loved
books
so
much
she
once
replied
because
they
tell
me
so
much
that
is
interesting
about
things
i
can
not
see
and
they
are
never
tired
or
troubled
like
people
they
tell
me
over
and
over
what
i
want
to
know
while
reading
from
dickens
child
history
of
england
we
came
to
the
sentence
still
the
spirit
of
the
britons
was
not
broken
i
asked
what
she
thought
that
meant
she
replied
i
think
it
means
that
the
brave
britons
were
not
discouraged
because
the
romans
had
won
so
many
battles
and
they
wished
all
the
more
to
drive
them
away
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
her
to
define
the
words
in
this
sentence
and
yet
she
had
caught
the
author
meaning
and
was
able
to
give
it
in
her
own
words
the
next
lines
are
still
more
idiomatic
when
suetonius
left
the
country
they
fell
upon
his
troops
and
retook
the
island
of
anglesea
here
is
her
interpretation
of
the
sentence
it
means
that
when
the
roman
general
had
gone
away
the
britons
began
to
fight
again
and
because
the
roman
soldiers
had
no
general
to
tell
them
what
to
do
they
were
overcome
by
the
britons
and
lost
the
island
they
had
captured
she
prefers
intellectual
to
manual
occupations
and
is
not
so
fond
of
fancy
work
as
many
of
the
blind
children
are
yet
she
is
eager
to
join
them
in
whatever
they
are
doing
she
has
learned
to
use
the
caligraph
typewriter
and
writes
very
correctly
but
not
rapidly
as
yet
having
had
less
than
a
month
practice
more
than
two
years
ago
a
cousin
taught
her
the
telegraph
alphabet
by
making
the
dots
and
dashes
on
the
back
of
her
hand
with
his
finger
whenever
she
meets
any
one
who
is
familiar
with
this
system
she
is
delighted
to
use
it
in
conversation
i
have
found
it
a
convenient
medium
of
communicating
with
helen
when
she
is
at
some
distance
from
me
for
it
enables
me
to
talk
with
her
by
tapping
upon
the
floor
with
my
foot
she
feels
the
vibrations
and
understands
what
is
said
to
her
it
was
hoped
that
one
so
peculiarly
endowed
by
nature
as
helen
would
if
left
entirely
to
her
own
resources
throw
some
light
upon
such
psychological
questions
as
were
not
exhaustively
investigated
by
howe
but
their
hopes
were
not
to
be
realized
in
the
case
of
helen
as
in
that
of
laura
bridgman
disappointment
was
inevitable
it
is
impossible
to
isolate
a
child
in
the
midst
of
society
so
that
he
shall
not
be
influenced
by
the
beliefs
of
those
with
whom
he
associates
in
helen
case
such
an
end
could
not
have
been
attained
without
depriving
her
of
that
intercourse
with
others
which
is
essential
to
her
nature
it
must
have
been
evident
to
those
who
watched
the
rapid
unfolding
of
helen
faculties
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
keep
her
inquisitive
spirit
for
any
length
of
time
from
reaching
out
toward
the
unfathomable
mysteries
of
life
but
great
care
has
been
taken
not
to
lead
her
thoughts
prematurely
to
the
consideration
of
subjects
which
perplex
and
confuse
all
minds
children
ask
profound
questions
but
they
often
receive
shallow
answers
or
to
speak
more
correctly
they
are
quieted
by
such
answers
were
did
i
come
from
and
where
shall
i
go
when
i
die
were
questions
helen
asked
when
she
was
eight
years
old
but
the
explanations
which
she
was
able
to
understand
at
that
time
did
not
satisfy
although
they
forced
her
to
remain
silent
until
her
mind
should
begin
to
put
forth
its
higher
powers
and
generalize
from
innumerable
impressions
and
ideas
which
streamed
in
upon
it
from
books
and
from
her
daily
experiences
her
mind
sought
for
the
cause
of
things
as
her
observation
of
phenomena
became
more
extensive
and
her
vocabulary
richer
and
more
subtle
enabling
her
to
express
her
own
conceptions
and
ideas
clearly
and
also
to
comprehend
the
thoughts
and
experiences
of
others
she
became
acquainted
with
the
limit
of
human
creative
power
and
perceived
that
some
power
not
human
must
have
created
the
earth
the
sun
and
the
thousand
natural
objects
with
which
she
was
perfectly
familiar
finally
she
one
day
demanded
a
name
for
the
power
the
existence
of
which
she
had
already
conceived
in
her
own
mind
through
charles
kingsley
greek
heroes
she
had
become
familiar
with
the
beautiful
stories
of
the
greek
gods
and
goddesses
and
she
must
have
met
with
the
words
god
heaven
soul
and
a
great
many
similar
expressions
in
books
she
never
asked
the
meaning
of
such
words
nor
made
any
comment
when
they
occurred
and
until
february
no
one
had
ever
spoken
to
her
of
god
at
that
time
a
dear
relative
who
was
also
an
earnest
christian
tried
to
tell
her
about
god
but
as
this
lady
did
not
use
words
suited
to
the
comprehension
of
the
child
they
made
little
impression
upon
helen
mind
when
i
subsequently
talked
with
her
she
said
i
have
something
very
funny
to
tell
you
says
god
made
me
and
every
one
out
of
sand
but
it
must
be
a
joke
i
am
made
of
flesh
and
blood
and
bone
am
i
not
here
she
examined
her
arm
with
evident
satisfaction
laughing
heartily
to
herself
after
a
moment
she
went
on
says
god
is
everywhere
and
that
he
is
all
love
but
i
do
not
think
a
person
can
be
made
out
of
love
love
is
only
something
in
our
hearts
then
said
another
very
comical
thing
she
says
he
meaning
god
is
my
dear
father
it
made
me
laugh
quite
hard
for
i
know
my
father
is
arthur
keller
i
explained
to
her
that
she
was
not
yet
able
to
understand
what
had
been
told
her
and
so
easily
led
her
to
see
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
talk
about
such
things
until
she
was
wiser
she
had
met
with
the
expression
mother
nature
in
the
course
of
her
reading
and
for
a
long
time
she
was
in
the
habit
of
ascribing
to
mother
nature
whatever
she
felt
to
be
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
accomplish
she
would
say
when
speaking
of
the
growth
of
a
plant
mother
nature
sends
the
sunshine
and
the
rain
to
make
the
trees
and
the
grass
and
the
flowers
grow
the
following
extract
from
my
notes
will
show
what
were
her
ideas
at
this
time
helen
seemed
a
little
serious
after
supper
and
asked
her
of
what
she
was
thinking
i
am
thinking
how
very
busy
dear
mother
nature
is
in
the
springtime
she
replied
when
asked
why
she
answered
because
she
has
so
many
children
to
take
care
of
she
is
the
mother
of
everything
the
flowers
and
trees
and
winds
how
does
mother
nature
take
care
of
the
flowers
i
asked
she
sends
the
sunshine
and
rain
to
make
them
grow
helen
replied
and
after
a
moment
she
added
i
think
the
sunshine
is
nature
warm
smile
and
the
raindrops
are
her
tears
later
she
said
i
do
not
know
if
mother
nature
made
me
i
think
my
mother
got
me
from
heaven
but
i
do
not
know
where
that
place
is
i
know
that
daisies
and
pansies
come
from
seeds
which
have
been
put
in
the
ground
but
children
do
not
grow
out
of
the
ground
i
am
sure
i
have
never
seen
a
but
i
can
not
imagine
who
made
mother
nature
can
you
i
love
the
beautiful
spring
because
the
budding
trees
and
the
blossoming
flowers
and
the
tender
green
leaves
fill
my
heart
with
joy
i
must
go
now
to
see
my
garden
the
daisies
and
the
pansies
will
think
i
have
forgotten
them
after
may
it
was
evident
to
me
that
she
had
reached
a
point
where
it
was
impossible
to
keep
from
her
the
religious
beliefs
held
by
those
with
whom
she
was
in
daily
contact
she
almost
overwhelmed
me
with
inquiries
which
were
the
natural
outgrowth
of
her
quickened
intelligence
early
in
may
she
wrote
on
her
tablet
the
following
list
of
questions
i
wish
to
write
about
things
i
do
not
understand
who
made
the
earth
and
the
seas
and
everything
what
makes
the
sun
hot
where
was
i
before
i
came
to
mother
i
know
that
plants
grow
from
seeds
which
are
in
the
ground
but
i
am
sure
people
do
not
grow
that
way
i
never
saw
a
little
birds
and
chickens
come
out
of
eggs
i
have
seen
them
what
was
the
egg
before
it
was
an
egg
why
does
not
the
earth
fall
it
is
so
very
large
and
heavy
tell
me
something
that
father
nature
does
may
i
read
the
book
called
the
bible
please
tell
your
little
pupil
many
things
when
you
have
much
time
can
any
one
doubt
after
reading
these
questions
that
the
child
who
was
capable
of
asking
them
was
also
capable
of
understanding
at
least
their
elementary
answers
she
could
not
of
course
have
grasped
such
abstractions
as
a
complete
answer
to
her
questions
would
involve
but
one
whole
life
is
nothing
more
than
a
continual
advance
in
the
comprehension
of
the
meaning
and
scope
of
such
ideas
throughout
helen
education
i
have
invariably
assumed
that
she
can
understand
whatever
it
is
desirable
for
her
to
know
unless
there
had
been
in
helen
mind
some
such
intellectual
process
as
the
questions
indicate
any
explanation
of
them
would
have
been
unintelligible
to
her
without
that
degree
of
mental
development
and
activity
which
perceives
the
necessity
of
superhuman
creative
power
no
explanation
of
natural
phenomena
is
possible
after
she
had
succeeded
in
formulating
the
ideas
which
had
been
slowly
growing
in
her
mind
they
seemed
suddenly
to
absorb
all
her
thoughts
and
she
became
impatient
to
have
everything
explained
as
we
were
passing
a
large
globe
a
short
time
after
she
had
written
the
questions
she
stopped
before
it
and
asked
who
made
the
real
world
i
replied
no
one
knows
how
the
earth
the
sun
and
all
the
worlds
which
we
call
stars
came
to
be
but
i
will
tell
you
how
wise
men
have
tried
to
account
for
their
origin
and
to
interpret
the
great
and
mysterious
forces
of
nature
she
knew
that
the
greeks
had
many
gods
to
whom
they
ascribed
various
powers
because
they
believed
that
the
sun
the
lightning
and
a
hundred
other
natural
forces
were
independent
and
superhuman
powers
but
after
a
great
deal
of
thought
and
study
i
told
her
men
came
to
believe
that
all
forces
were
manifestations
of
one
power
and
to
that
power
they
gave
the
name
god
she
was
very
still
for
a
few
minutes
evidently
thinking
earnestly
she
then
asked
who
made
god
i
was
compelled
to
evade
her
question
for
i
could
not
explain
to
her
the
mystery
of
a
being
indeed
many
of
her
eager
questions
would
have
puzzled
a
far
wiser
person
than
i
am
here
are
some
of
them
what
did
god
make
the
new
worlds
out
of
where
did
he
get
the
soil
and
the
water
and
the
seeds
and
the
first
animals
where
is
god
did
you
ever
see
god
i
told
her
that
god
was
everywhere
and
that
she
must
not
think
of
him
as
a
person
but
as
the
life
the
mind
the
soul
of
everything
she
interrupted
me
everything
does
not
have
life
the
rocks
have
not
life
and
they
can
not
think
it
is
often
necessary
to
remind
her
that
there
are
infinitely
many
things
that
the
wisest
people
in
the
world
can
not
explain
no
creed
or
dogma
has
been
taught
to
helen
nor
has
any
effort
been
made
to
force
religious
beliefs
upon
her
attention
being
fully
aware
of
my
own
incompetence
to
give
her
any
adequate
explanations
of
the
mysteries
which
underlie
the
names
of
god
soul
and
immortality
i
have
always
felt
obliged
by
a
sense
of
duty
to
my
pupil
to
say
as
little
as
possible
about
spiritual
matters
the
rt
rev
phillips
brooks
has
explained
to
her
in
a
beautiful
way
the
fatherhood
of
god
she
has
not
as
yet
been
allowed
to
read
the
bible
because
i
do
not
see
how
she
can
do
so
at
present
without
getting
a
very
erroneous
conception
of
the
attributes
of
god
i
have
already
told
her
in
simple
language
of
the
beautiful
and
helpful
life
of
jesus
and
of
his
cruel
death
the
narrative
affected
her
greatly
when
first
she
listened
to
it
when
she
referred
to
our
conversation
again
it
was
to
ask
why
did
not
jesus
go
away
so
that
his
enemies
could
not
find
him
she
thought
the
miracles
of
jesus
very
strange
when
told
that
jesus
walked
on
the
sea
to
meet
his
disciples
she
said
decidedly
it
does
not
mean
walked
it
means
swam
when
told
of
the
instance
in
which
jesus
raised
the
dead
she
was
much
perplexed
saying
i
did
not
know
life
could
come
back
into
the
dead
body
one
day
she
said
sadly
i
am
blind
and
deaf
that
is
why
i
can
not
see
god
i
taught
her
the
word
invisible
and
told
her
we
could
not
see
god
with
our
eyes
because
he
was
a
spirit
but
that
when
our
hearts
were
full
of
goodness
and
gentleness
then
we
saw
him
because
then
we
were
more
like
him
at
another
time
she
asked
what
is
a
soul
no
one
knows
what
the
soul
is
like
i
replied
but
we
know
that
it
is
not
the
body
and
it
is
that
part
of
us
which
thinks
and
loves
and
hopes
and
which
christian
people
believe
will
live
on
after
the
body
is
dead
i
then
asked
her
can
you
think
of
your
soul
as
separate
from
your
body
oh
yes
she
replied
because
last
hour
i
was
thinking
very
hard
of
anagnos
and
then
my
mind
then
changing
the
word
my
soul
was
in
athens
but
my
body
was
here
in
the
study
at
this
moment
another
thought
seemed
to
flash
through
her
mind
and
she
added
but
anagnos
did
not
speak
to
my
soul
i
explained
to
her
that
the
soul
too
is
invisible
or
in
other
words
that
it
is
without
apparent
form
but
if
i
write
what
my
soul
thinks
she
said
then
it
will
be
visible
and
the
words
will
be
its
body
a
long
time
ago
helen
said
to
me
i
would
like
to
live
sixteen
hundred
years
when
asked
if
she
would
not
like
to
live
always
in
a
beautiful
country
called
heaven
her
first
question
was
where
is
heaven
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
i
did
not
know
but
suggested
that
it
might
be
on
one
of
the
stars
a
moment
after
she
said
will
you
please
go
first
and
tell
me
all
about
it
and
then
she
added
tuscumbia
is
a
very
beautiful
little
town
it
was
more
than
a
year
before
she
alluded
to
the
subject
again
and
when
she
did
return
to
it
her
questions
were
numerous
and
persistent
she
asked
where
is
heaven
and
what
is
it
like
why
can
not
we
know
as
much
about
heaven
as
we
do
about
foreign
countries
i
told
her
in
very
simple
language
that
there
may
be
many
places
called
heaven
but
that
essentially
it
was
a
condition
the
fulfilment
of
the
heart
desire
the
satisfaction
of
its
wants
and
that
heaven
existed
wherever
right
was
acknowledged
believed
in
and
loved
she
shrinks
from
the
thought
of
death
with
evident
dismay
recently
on
being
shown
a
deer
which
had
been
killed
by
her
brother
she
was
greatly
distressed
and
asked
sorrowfully
why
must
everything
die
even
the
deer
at
another
time
she
asked
do
you
not
think
we
would
be
very
much
happier
always
if
we
did
not
have
to
die
i
said
no
because
if
there
were
no
death
our
world
would
soon
be
so
crowded
with
living
creatures
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
of
them
to
live
comfortably
but
said
helen
quickly
i
think
god
could
make
some
more
worlds
as
well
as
he
made
this
one
when
friends
have
told
her
of
the
great
happiness
which
awaits
her
in
another
life
she
instantly
asked
how
do
you
know
if
you
have
not
been
dead
the
literal
sense
in
which
she
sometimes
takes
common
words
and
idioms
shows
how
necessary
it
is
that
we
should
make
sure
that
she
receives
their
correct
meaning
when
told
recently
that
hungarians
were
born
musicians
she
asked
in
surprise
do
they
sing
when
they
are
born
when
her
friend
added
that
some
of
the
pupils
he
had
seen
in
budapest
had
more
than
one
hundred
tunes
in
their
heads
she
said
laughing
i
think
their
heads
must
be
very
noisy
she
sees
the
ridiculous
quickly
and
instead
of
being
seriously
troubled
by
metaphorical
language
she
is
often
amused
at
her
own
too
literal
conception
of
its
meaning
having
been
told
that
the
soul
was
without
form
she
was
much
perplexed
at
david
words
he
leadeth
my
soul
has
it
feet
can
it
walk
is
it
blind
she
asked
for
in
her
mind
the
idea
of
being
led
was
associated
with
blindness
of
all
the
subjects
which
perplex
and
trouble
helen
none
distresses
her
so
much
as
the
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
evil
and
of
the
suffering
which
results
from
it
for
a
long
time
it
was
possible
to
keep
this
knowledge
from
her
and
it
will
always
be
comparatively
easy
to
prevent
her
from
coming
in
personal
contact
with
vice
and
wickedness
the
fact
that
sin
exists
and
that
great
misery
results
from
it
dawned
gradually
upon
her
mind
as
she
understood
more
and
more
clearly
the
lives
and
experiences
of
those
around
her
the
necessity
of
laws
and
penalties
had
to
be
explained
to
her
she
found
it
very
hard
to
reconcile
the
presence
of
evil
in
the
world
with
the
idea
of
god
which
had
been
presented
to
her
mind
one
day
she
asked
does
god
take
care
of
us
all
the
time
she
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
then
why
did
he
let
little
sister
fall
this
morning
and
hurt
her
head
so
badly
another
time
she
was
asking
about
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
she
had
been
told
of
a
terrible
storm
at
sea
in
which
several
lives
were
lost
and
she
asked
why
did
not
god
save
the
people
if
he
can
do
all
things
surrounded
by
loving
friends
and
the
gentlest
influences
as
helen
had
always
been
she
has
from
the
earliest
stage
of
her
intellectual
enlightenment
willingly
done
right
she
knows
with
unerring
instinct
what
is
right
and
does
it
joyously
she
does
not
think
of
one
wrong
act
as
harmless
of
another
as
of
no
consequence
and
of
another
as
not
intended
to
her
pure
soul
all
evil
is
equally
unlovely
these
passages
from
the
paper
miss
sullivan
prepared
for
the
meeting
at
chautauqua
in
july
of
the
american
association
to
promote
the
teaching
of
speech
to
the
deaf
contain
her
latest
written
account
of
her
methods
you
must
not
imagine
that
as
soon
as
helen
grasped
the
idea
that
everything
had
a
name
she
at
once
became
mistress
of
the
treasury
of
the
english
language
or
that
her
mental
faculties
emerged
full
armed
from
their
then
living
tomb
as
pallas
athene
from
the
head
of
zeus
as
one
of
her
enthusiastic
admirers
would
have
us
believe
at
first
the
words
phrases
and
sentences
which
she
used
in
expressing
her
thoughts
were
all
reproductions
of
what
we
had
used
in
conversation
with
her
and
which
her
memory
had
unconsciously
retained
and
indeed
this
is
true
of
the
language
of
all
children
their
language
is
the
memory
of
the
language
they
hear
spoken
in
their
homes
countless
repetition
of
the
conversation
of
daily
life
has
impressed
certain
words
and
phrases
upon
their
memories
and
when
they
come
to
talk
themselves
memory
supplies
the
words
they
lisp
likewise
the
language
of
educated
people
is
the
memory
of
the
language
of
books
language
grows
out
of
life
out
of
its
needs
and
experiences
at
first
my
little
pupil
mind
was
all
but
vacant
she
had
been
living
in
a
world
she
could
not
realize
language
and
knowledge
are
indissolubly
connected
they
are
interdependent
good
work
in
language
presupposes
and
depends
on
a
real
knowledge
of
things
as
soon
as
helen
grasped
the
idea
that
everything
had
a
name
and
that
by
means
of
the
manual
alphabet
these
names
could
be
transmitted
from
one
to
another
i
proceeded
to
awaken
her
further
interest
in
the
objects
whose
names
she
learned
to
spell
with
such
evident
joy
i
never
taught
language
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
it
but
invariably
used
language
as
a
medium
for
the
communication
of
thought
thus
the
learning
of
language
was
coincident
with
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
in
order
to
use
language
intelligently
one
must
have
something
to
talk
about
and
having
something
to
talk
about
is
the
result
of
having
had
experiences
no
amount
of
language
training
will
enable
our
little
children
to
use
language
with
ease
and
fluency
unless
they
have
something
clearly
in
their
minds
which
they
wish
to
communicate
or
unless
we
succeed
in
awakening
in
them
a
desire
to
know
what
is
in
the
minds
of
others
at
first
i
did
not
attempt
to
confine
my
pupil
to
any
system
i
always
tried
to
find
out
what
interested
her
most
and
made
that
the
for
the
new
lesson
whether
it
had
any
bearing
on
the
lesson
i
had
planned
to
teach
or
not
during
the
first
two
years
of
her
intellectual
life
i
required
helen
to
write
very
little
in
order
to
write
one
must
have
something
to
write
about
and
having
something
to
write
about
requires
some
mental
preparation
the
memory
must
be
stored
with
ideas
and
the
mind
must
be
enriched
with
knowledge
before
writing
becomes
a
natural
and
pleasurable
effort
too
often
i
think
children
are
required
to
write
before
they
have
anything
to
say
teach
them
to
think
and
read
and
talk
without
and
they
will
write
because
they
can
not
help
it
helen
acquired
language
by
practice
and
habit
rather
than
by
study
of
rules
and
definitions
grammar
with
its
puzzling
array
of
classifications
nomenclatures
and
paradigms
was
wholly
discarded
in
her
education
she
learned
language
by
being
brought
in
contact
with
the
living
language
itself
she
was
made
to
deal
with
it
in
everyday
conversation
and
in
her
books
and
to
turn
it
over
in
a
variety
of
ways
until
she
was
able
to
use
it
correctly
no
doubt
i
talked
much
more
with
my
fingers
and
more
constantly
than
i
should
have
done
with
my
mouth
for
had
she
possessed
the
use
of
sight
and
hearing
she
would
have
been
less
dependent
on
me
for
entertainment
and
instruction
i
believe
every
child
has
hidden
away
somewhere
in
his
being
noble
capacities
which
may
be
quickened
and
developed
if
we
go
about
it
in
the
right
way
but
we
shall
never
properly
develop
the
higher
natures
of
our
little
ones
while
we
continue
to
fill
their
minds
with
the
rudiments
mathematics
will
never
make
them
loving
nor
will
the
accurate
knowledge
of
the
size
and
shape
of
the
world
help
them
to
appreciate
its
beauties
let
us
lead
them
during
the
first
years
to
find
their
greatest
pleasure
in
nature
let
them
run
in
the
fields
learn
about
animals
and
observe
real
things
children
will
educate
themselves
under
right
conditions
they
require
guidance
and
sympathy
far
more
than
instruction
i
think
much
of
the
fluency
with
which
helen
uses
language
is
due
to
the
fact
that
nearly
every
impression
which
she
receives
comes
through
the
medium
of
language
but
after
due
allowance
has
been
made
for
natural
aptitude
for
acquiring
language
and
for
the
advantage
resulting
from
her
peculiar
environment
i
think
that
we
shall
still
find
that
the
constant
companionship
of
good
books
has
been
of
supreme
importance
in
her
education
it
may
be
true
as
some
maintain
that
language
can
not
express
to
us
much
beyond
what
we
have
lived
and
experienced
but
i
have
always
observed
that
children
manifest
the
greatest
delight
in
the
lofty
poetic
language
which
we
are
too
ready
to
think
beyond
their
comprehension
this
is
all
you
will
understand
said
a
teacher
to
a
class
of
little
children
closing
the
book
which
she
had
been
reading
to
them
oh
please
read
us
the
rest
even
if
we
wo
understand
it
they
pleaded
delighted
with
the
rhythm
and
the
beauty
which
they
felt
even
though
they
could
not
have
explained
it
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
child
should
understand
every
word
in
a
book
before
he
can
read
with
pleasure
and
profit
indeed
only
such
explanations
should
be
given
as
are
really
essential
helen
drank
in
language
which
she
at
first
could
not
understand
and
it
remained
in
her
mind
until
needed
when
it
fitted
itself
naturally
and
easily
into
her
conversation
and
compositions
indeed
it
is
maintained
by
some
that
she
reads
too
much
that
a
great
deal
of
originative
force
is
dissipated
in
the
enjoyment
of
books
that
when
she
might
see
and
say
things
for
herself
she
sees
them
only
through
the
eyes
of
others
and
says
them
in
their
language
but
i
am
convinced
that
original
composition
without
the
preparation
of
much
reading
is
an
impossibility
helen
has
had
the
best
and
purest
models
in
language
constantly
presented
to
her
and
her
conversation
and
her
writing
are
unconscious
reproductions
of
what
she
has
read
reading
i
think
should
be
kept
independent
of
the
regular
school
exercises
children
should
be
encouraged
to
read
for
the
pure
delight
of
it
the
attitude
of
the
child
toward
his
books
should
be
that
of
unconscious
receptivity
the
great
works
of
the
imagination
ought
to
become
a
part
of
his
life
as
they
were
once
of
the
very
substance
of
the
men
who
wrote
them
it
is
true
the
more
sensitive
and
imaginative
the
mind
is
that
receives
the
and
images
of
literature
the
more
nicely
the
finest
lines
are
reproduced
helen
has
the
vitality
of
feeling
the
freshness
and
eagerness
of
interest
and
the
spiritual
insight
of
the
artistic
temperament
and
naturally
she
has
a
more
active
and
intense
joy
in
life
simply
as
life
and
in
nature
books
and
people
than
less
gifted
mortals
her
mind
is
so
filled
with
the
beautiful
thoughts
and
ideals
of
the
great
poets
that
nothing
seems
commonplace
to
her
for
her
imagination
colours
all
life
with
its
own
rich
hues
there
has
been
much
discussion
of
such
of
miss
sullivan
statements
and
explanations
as
have
been
published
before
too
much
has
been
written
by
people
who
do
not
know
the
problems
of
the
deaf
at
first
hand
and
i
do
not
care
to
add
much
to
it
miss
keller
education
however
is
so
fundamentally
a
question
of
language
teaching
that
it
rather
includes
the
problems
of
the
deaf
than
limits
itself
to
the
deaf
alone
teachers
can
draw
their
own
conclusions
for
the
majority
of
readers
who
will
not
approach
miss
keller
life
from
the
educator
point
of
view
i
will
summarize
a
few
principal
things
in
miss
sullivan
methods
miss
sullivan
has
begun
where
howe
left
off
he
invented
the
instrument
the
physical
means
of
working
but
the
teaching
of
language
is
quite
another
thing
from
the
mechanical
means
by
which
language
may
be
taught
by
experiment
by
studying
other
children
miss
sullivan
came
upon
the
practical
way
of
teaching
language
by
the
natural
method
it
was
for
this
natural
method
that
howe
was
groping
but
he
never
got
to
this
idea
that
a
deaf
child
should
not
be
taught
each
word
separately
by
definition
but
should
be
given
language
by
endless
repetition
of
language
which
it
does
not
understand
and
this
is
miss
sullivan
great
discovery
all
day
long
in
their
and
miss
sullivan
kept
spelling
into
her
pupil
hand
and
by
that
helen
keller
absorbed
words
just
as
the
child
in
the
cradle
absorbs
words
by
hearing
thousands
of
them
before
he
uses
one
and
by
associating
the
words
with
the
occasion
of
their
utterance
thus
he
learns
that
words
name
things
and
actions
and
feelings
now
that
is
the
first
principle
in
miss
sullivan
method
one
that
had
practical
results
and
one
which
so
far
as
i
can
discover
had
never
been
put
in
practice
in
the
education
of
a
deaf
child
not
to
say
a
child
until
miss
sullivan
tried
it
with
helen
keller
and
the
principle
had
never
been
formulated
clearly
until
miss
sullivan
wrote
her
letters
the
second
principle
in
her
method
the
numerical
order
is
of
course
arbitrary
is
never
to
talk
to
the
child
about
things
distasteful
or
wearisome
to
him
in
the
first
deaf
school
miss
sullivan
ever
visited
the
teacher
was
busy
at
the
blackboard
telling
the
children
by
written
words
something
they
did
not
want
to
know
while
they
were
crowding
round
their
visitor
with
curiosity
showing
there
were
a
thousand
things
they
did
want
to
know
why
not
says
miss
sullivan
make
a
language
lesson
out
of
what
they
were
interested
in
akin
to
this
idea
of
talking
to
the
child
about
what
interests
him
is
the
principle
never
to
silence
a
child
who
asks
questions
but
to
answer
the
questions
as
truly
as
possible
for
says
miss
sullivan
the
question
is
the
door
to
the
child
mind
miss
sullivan
never
needlessly
belittled
her
ideas
or
expressions
to
suit
the
supposed
state
of
the
child
intelligence
she
urged
every
one
to
speak
to
helen
naturally
to
give
her
full
sentences
and
intelligent
ideas
never
minding
whether
helen
understood
or
not
thus
miss
sullivan
knew
what
so
many
people
do
not
understand
that
after
the
first
rudimentary
definitions
of
hat
cup
go
sit
the
unit
of
language
as
the
child
learns
it
is
the
sentence
which
is
also
the
unit
of
language
in
our
adult
experience
we
do
not
take
in
a
sentence
word
by
word
but
as
a
whole
it
is
the
proposition
something
predicated
about
something
that
conveys
an
idea
true
single
words
do
suggest
and
express
ideas
the
child
may
say
simply
mamma
when
he
means
where
is
mamma
but
he
learns
the
expression
of
the
ideas
that
relate
to
mamma
he
learns
language
by
hearing
complete
sentences
and
though
miss
sullivan
did
not
force
grammatical
completeness
upon
the
first
of
her
pupil
yet
when
she
herself
repeated
helen
sentence
mamma
milk
she
filled
out
the
construction
completed
the
child
ellipsis
and
said
mamma
will
bring
helen
some
milk
thus
miss
sullivan
was
working
out
a
natural
method
which
is
so
simple
so
lacking
in
artificial
system
that
her
method
seems
rather
to
be
a
destruction
of
method
it
is
doubtful
if
we
should
have
heard
of
helen
keller
if
miss
sullivan
had
not
been
where
there
were
other
children
by
watching
them
she
learned
to
treat
her
pupil
as
nearly
as
possible
like
an
ordinary
child
the
manual
alphabet
was
not
the
only
means
of
presenting
words
to
helen
keller
fingers
books
supplemented
perhaps
equaled
in
importance
the
manual
alphabet
as
a
means
of
teaching
language
helen
sat
poring
over
them
before
she
could
read
not
at
first
for
the
story
but
to
find
words
she
knew
and
the
definition
of
new
words
which
is
implied
in
their
context
in
their
position
with
reference
to
words
known
added
to
helen
vocabulary
books
are
the
storehouse
of
language
and
any
child
whether
deaf
or
not
if
he
has
his
attention
attracted
in
any
way
to
printed
pages
must
learn
he
learns
not
by
reading
what
he
understands
but
by
reading
and
remembering
words
he
does
not
understand
and
though
perhaps
few
children
will
have
as
much
precocious
interest
in
books
as
did
helen
keller
yet
the
natural
curiosity
of
every
healthy
child
may
be
turned
to
printed
pages
especially
if
the
teacher
is
clever
and
plays
a
word
game
as
miss
sullivan
did
helen
keller
is
supposed
to
have
a
special
aptitude
for
languages
it
is
true
rather
that
she
has
a
special
aptitude
for
thinking
and
her
leaning
toward
language
is
due
to
the
fact
that
language
to
her
meant
life
it
was
not
a
special
subject
like
geography
or
arithmetic
but
her
way
to
outward
things
when
at
the
age
of
fourteen
she
had
had
but
a
few
lessons
in
german
she
read
over
the
words
of
wilhelm
tell
and
managed
to
get
the
story
of
grammar
she
knew
nothing
and
she
cared
nothing
for
it
she
got
the
language
from
the
language
itself
and
this
is
next
to
hearing
the
language
spoken
the
way
for
any
one
to
get
a
foreign
tongue
more
vital
and
in
the
end
easier
than
our
schoolroom
method
of
beginning
with
the
grammar
in
the
same
way
she
played
with
latin
learning
not
only
from
the
lessons
her
first
latin
teacher
gave
her
but
from
going
over
and
over
the
words
of
a
text
a
game
she
played
by
herself
john
wright
one
of
her
teachers
at
the
school
says
in
a
letter
to
me
often
i
found
her
when
she
had
a
little
leisure
sitting
in
her
favourite
corner
in
a
chair
whose
arms
supported
the
big
volume
prepared
for
the
blind
and
passing
her
finger
slowly
over
the
lines
of
moliere
medecin
malgre
lui
chuckling
to
herself
at
the
comical
situations
and
humorous
lines
at
that
time
her
actual
working
vocabulary
in
french
was
very
small
but
by
using
her
judgment
as
we
laughingly
called
the
mental
process
she
could
guess
at
the
meanings
of
the
words
and
put
the
sense
together
much
as
a
child
puzzles
out
a
sliced
object
the
result
was
that
in
a
few
weeks
she
and
i
spent
a
most
hilarious
hour
one
evening
while
she
poured
out
to
me
the
whole
story
dwelling
with
great
gusto
on
its
humour
and
sparkling
wit
it
was
not
a
lesson
but
only
one
of
her
recreations
so
helen
keller
aptitude
for
language
is
her
whole
mental
aptitude
turned
to
language
because
of
its
extraordinary
value
to
her
there
have
been
many
discussions
of
the
question
whether
helen
achievements
are
due
to
her
natural
ability
or
to
the
method
by
which
she
was
taught
it
is
true
that
a
teacher
with
ten
times
miss
sullivan
genius
could
not
have
made
a
pupil
so
remarkable
as
helen
keller
out
of
a
child
born
dull
and
mentally
deficient
but
it
is
also
true
that
with
ten
times
her
native
genius
helen
keller
could
not
have
grown
to
what
she
is
if
she
had
not
been
excellently
taught
from
the
very
start
and
especially
at
the
start
and
the
fact
remains
that
she
was
taught
by
a
method
of
teaching
language
to
the
deaf
the
essential
principles
of
which
are
clearly
expressed
in
miss
sullivan
letters
written
while
she
was
discovering
the
method
and
putting
it
successfully
into
practice
and
it
can
be
applied
by
any
teacher
to
any
healthy
deaf
child
and
in
the
broadest
interpretation
of
the
principles
can
be
applied
to
the
teaching
of
language
of
all
kinds
to
all
children
in
the
many
discussions
of
this
question
writers
seem
to
throw
us
from
one
horn
to
another
of
a
dilemma
either
a
born
genius
in
helen
keller
or
a
perfect
method
in
the
teacher
both
things
may
be
true
at
once
and
there
is
another
truth
which
makes
the
dilemma
imperfect
miss
sullivan
is
a
person
of
extraordinary
power
her
method
might
not
succeed
so
completely
in
the
hands
of
any
one
else
miss
sullivan
vigorous
original
mind
has
lent
much
of
its
vitality
to
her
pupil
if
miss
keller
is
fond
of
language
and
not
interested
especially
in
mathematics
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
miss
sullivan
interests
very
similar
and
this
does
not
mean
that
miss
keller
is
unduly
dependent
on
her
teacher
it
is
told
of
her
that
as
a
child
of
eight
when
some
one
tried
to
interfere
with
her
she
sat
sober
a
few
moments
and
when
asked
what
was
the
trouble
answered
i
am
preparing
to
assert
my
independence
such
an
aggressive
personality
can
not
grow
up
in
mere
dependence
even
under
the
guidance
of
a
will
like
miss
sullivan
but
miss
sullivan
by
her
natural
aptitude
has
done
for
her
pupil
much
that
is
not
capable
of
analysis
and
reduction
to
principle
she
has
given
the
inspiration
which
is
in
all
close
friendship
and
which
rather
develops
than
limits
the
powers
of
either
person
moreover
if
miss
keller
is
a
marvel
of
sweetness
and
goodness
if
she
has
a
love
of
all
things
good
and
beautiful
this
implies
something
about
the
teacher
who
has
lived
with
her
for
sixteen
years
there
is
then
a
good
deal
that
miss
sullivan
has
done
for
miss
keller
which
no
other
teacher
can
do
in
just
the
same
way
for
any
one
else
to
have
another
helen
keller
there
must
be
another
miss
sullivan
to
have
another
deaf
and
blind
child
there
need
only
be
another
teacher
living
under
favourable
conditions
among
plenty
of
external
interests
unseparated
from
her
pupil
allowed
to
have
a
free
hand
and
using
as
many
as
she
needs
of
the
principles
which
miss
sullivan
has
saved
her
the
trouble
of
finding
out
for
herself
modifying
and
adding
as
she
finds
it
necessary
and
there
must
be
a
pupil
in
good
health
of
good
native
powers
young
enough
not
to
have
grown
beyond
recovery
in
ignorance
any
deaf
child
or
deaf
and
blind
child
in
good
health
can
be
taught
and
the
one
to
do
it
is
the
parent
or
the
special
teacher
not
the
school
i
know
that
this
idea
will
be
vigorously
combated
by
those
who
conduct
schools
for
the
deaf
to
be
sure
the
deaf
school
is
the
only
thing
possible
for
children
educated
by
the
state
but
it
is
evident
that
precisely
what
the
deaf
child
needs
to
be
taught
is
what
other
children
learn
before
they
go
to
school
at
all
when
miss
sullivan
went
out
in
the
barnyard
and
picked
up
a
little
chicken
and
talked
to
helen
about
it
she
was
giving
a
kind
of
instruction
impossible
inside
four
walls
and
impossible
with
more
than
one
pupil
at
a
time
surely
howe
is
wrong
when
he
says
a
teacher
can
not
be
a
child
that
is
just
what
the
teacher
of
the
deaf
child
must
be
a
child
ready
to
play
and
romp
and
interested
in
all
childish
things
the
temptation
to
discuss
solely
in
the
light
of
helen
keller
the
whole
matter
of
educating
the
deaf
is
a
dangerous
one
and
one
which
i
have
not
taken
particular
care
to
avoid
because
my
opinions
are
of
no
authority
and
i
have
merely
tried
to
suggest
problems
and
reinforce
some
of
the
main
ideas
expressed
by
miss
sullivan
who
is
an
authority
it
is
a
question
whether
helen
keller
success
has
not
led
teachers
to
expect
too
much
of
other
children
and
i
know
of
children
who
are
dragged
along
by
their
teachers
and
friends
and
become
the
subjects
of
glowing
reports
which
are
pathetically
untrue
because
one
sees
behind
the
reports
how
the
children
are
tugged
at
to
bring
them
somewhere
near
the
exaggerated
things
that
are
said
about
them
let
me
sum
up
a
few
of
the
elements
that
made
helen
keller
what
she
is
in
the
first
place
she
had
nineteen
months
experience
of
sight
and
sound
this
meant
some
mental
development
she
had
inherited
vigour
of
body
and
mind
she
expressed
ideas
in
signs
before
she
learned
language
keller
writes
me
that
before
her
illness
helen
made
signs
for
everything
and
her
mother
thought
this
habit
the
cause
of
her
slowness
in
learning
to
speak
after
the
illness
when
they
were
dependent
on
signs
helen
tendency
to
gesture
developed
how
far
she
could
receive
communications
is
hard
to
determine
but
she
knew
much
that
was
going
on
around
her
she
recognized
that
others
used
their
lips
she
saw
her
father
reading
a
paper
and
when
he
laid
it
down
she
sat
in
his
chair
and
held
the
paper
before
her
face
her
early
rages
were
an
unhappy
expression
of
the
natural
force
of
character
which
instruction
was
to
turn
into
trained
and
organized
power
it
was
then
to
a
good
subject
that
miss
sullivan
brought
her
devotion
and
intelligence
and
fearless
willingness
to
experiment
miss
sullivan
methods
were
so
good
that
even
without
the
practical
result
any
one
would
recognize
the
truth
of
the
teacher
ideas
miss
sullivan
has
in
addition
a
vigorous
personality
and
finally
all
the
conditions
were
good
for
that
first
nature
school
in
which
the
teacher
and
pupil
played
together
exploring
together
and
educating
themselves
pupil
and
teacher
inseparable
miss
keller
later
education
is
easy
to
understand
and
needs
no
further
explanation
than
she
has
given
those
interested
may
get
on
application
to
the
volta
bureau
washington
the
reports
of
the
teachers
who
prepared
her
for
college
arthur
gilman
of
the
cambridge
school
for
young
ladies
and
merton
keith
chapter
iv
speech
the
two
persons
who
have
written
authoritatively
about
miss
speech
and
the
way
she
learned
it
are
miss
sarah
fuller
of
the
horace
mann
school
for
the
deaf
in
boston
massachusetts
who
gave
her
the
first
lessons
and
miss
sullivan
who
by
her
unremitting
discipline
carried
on
the
success
of
these
first
lessons
before
i
quote
from
miss
sullivan
account
let
me
try
to
give
some
impression
of
what
miss
keller
speech
and
voice
qualities
are
at
present
her
voice
is
low
and
pleasant
to
listen
to
her
speech
lacks
variety
and
modulation
it
runs
in
a
when
she
is
reading
aloud
and
when
she
speaks
with
fair
degree
of
loudness
it
hovers
about
two
or
three
middle
tones
her
voice
has
an
aspirate
quality
there
seems
always
to
be
too
much
breath
for
the
amount
of
tone
some
of
her
notes
are
musical
and
charming
when
she
is
telling
a
child
story
or
one
with
pathos
in
it
her
voice
runs
into
pretty
slurs
from
one
tone
to
another
this
is
like
the
effect
of
the
slow
dwelling
on
long
words
not
quite
well
managed
that
one
notices
in
a
child
who
is
telling
a
solemn
story
the
principal
thing
that
is
lacking
is
sentence
accent
and
variety
in
the
inflection
of
phrases
miss
keller
pronounces
each
word
as
a
foreigner
does
when
he
is
still
labouring
with
the
elements
of
a
sentence
or
as
children
sometimes
read
in
school
when
they
have
to
pick
out
each
word
she
speaks
french
and
german
her
friend
john
hitz
whose
native
tongue
is
german
says
that
her
pronunciation
is
excellent
another
friend
who
is
as
familiar
with
french
as
with
english
finds
her
french
much
more
intelligible
than
her
english
when
she
speaks
english
she
distributes
her
emphasis
as
in
french
and
so
does
not
put
sufficient
stress
on
accented
syllables
she
says
for
example
with
ever
so
little
difference
between
the
value
of
syllables
and
a
good
deal
of
inconsistency
in
the
pronunciation
of
the
same
word
one
day
and
the
next
it
would
i
think
be
hard
to
make
her
feel
just
how
to
pronounce
dictionary
without
her
erring
either
toward
dictionayry
or
and
of
course
the
word
is
neither
one
nor
the
other
for
no
system
of
marks
in
a
lexicon
can
tell
one
how
to
pronounce
a
word
the
only
way
is
to
hear
it
especially
in
a
language
like
english
which
is
so
full
of
unspellable
suppressed
vowels
and
miss
keller
vowels
are
not
firm
her
awful
is
nearly
awfil
the
wavering
is
caused
by
the
absence
of
accent
on
ful
for
she
pronounces
full
correctly
she
sometimes
mispronounces
as
she
reads
aloud
and
comes
on
a
word
which
she
happens
never
to
have
uttered
though
she
may
have
written
it
many
times
this
difficulty
and
some
others
may
be
corrected
when
she
and
miss
sullivan
have
more
time
since
they
have
been
so
much
in
their
books
that
they
have
neglected
everything
that
was
not
necessary
to
the
immediate
task
of
passing
the
school
years
successfully
miss
keller
will
never
be
able
i
believe
to
speak
loud
without
destroying
the
pleasant
quality
and
the
distinctness
of
her
words
but
she
can
do
much
to
make
her
speech
clearer
when
she
was
at
the
school
in
new
york
humason
tried
to
improve
her
voice
not
only
her
word
pronunciation
but
the
voice
itself
and
gave
her
lessons
in
tone
and
vocal
exercises
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
or
not
miss
keller
speech
is
easy
to
understand
some
understand
her
readily
others
do
not
her
friends
grow
accustomed
to
her
speech
and
forget
that
it
is
different
from
that
of
any
one
else
children
seldom
have
any
difficulty
in
understanding
her
which
suggests
that
her
deliberate
measured
speech
is
like
theirs
before
they
come
to
the
adult
trick
of
running
all
the
words
of
a
phrase
into
one
movement
of
the
breath
i
am
told
that
miss
keller
speaks
better
than
most
other
deaf
people
miss
keller
has
told
how
she
learned
to
speak
miss
sullivan
account
in
her
address
at
chautauqua
in
july
at
the
meeting
of
the
american
association
to
promote
the
teaching
of
speech
to
the
deaf
is
substantially
like
miss
keller
in
points
of
fact
miss
sullivan
account
of
miss
keller
speech
it
was
three
years
from
the
time
when
helen
began
to
communicate
by
means
of
the
manual
alphabet
that
she
received
her
first
lesson
in
the
more
natural
and
universal
medium
of
human
intercourse
oral
language
she
had
become
very
proficient
in
the
use
of
the
manual
alphabet
which
was
her
only
means
of
communication
with
the
outside
world
through
it
she
had
acquired
a
vocabulary
which
enabled
her
to
converse
freely
read
intelligently
and
write
with
comparative
ease
and
correctness
nevertheless
the
impulse
to
utter
audible
sounds
was
strong
within
her
and
the
constant
efforts
which
i
made
to
repress
this
instinctive
tendency
which
i
feared
in
time
would
become
unpleasant
were
of
no
avail
i
made
no
effort
to
teach
her
to
speak
because
i
regarded
her
inability
to
watch
the
lips
of
others
as
an
insurmountable
obstacle
but
she
gradually
became
conscious
that
her
way
of
communicating
was
different
from
that
used
by
those
around
her
and
one
day
her
thoughts
found
expression
how
do
the
blind
girls
know
what
to
say
with
their
mouths
why
do
you
not
teach
me
to
talk
like
them
do
deaf
children
ever
learn
to
speak
i
explained
to
her
that
some
deaf
children
were
taught
to
speak
but
that
they
could
see
their
teachers
mouths
and
that
that
was
a
very
great
assistance
to
them
but
she
interrupted
me
to
say
she
was
very
sure
she
could
feel
my
mouth
very
well
soon
after
this
conversation
a
lady
came
to
see
her
and
told
her
about
the
deaf
and
blind
norwegian
child
ragnhild
kaata
who
had
been
taught
to
speak
and
understand
what
her
teacher
said
to
her
by
touching
his
lips
with
her
fingers
she
at
once
resolved
to
learn
to
speak
and
from
that
day
to
this
she
has
never
wavered
in
that
resolution
she
began
immediately
to
make
sounds
which
she
called
speaking
and
i
saw
the
necessity
of
correct
instruction
since
her
heart
was
set
upon
learning
to
talk
and
feeling
my
own
incompetence
to
teach
her
never
having
given
the
subject
of
articulation
serious
study
i
went
with
my
pupil
for
advice
and
assistance
to
miss
sarah
fuller
miss
fuller
was
delighted
with
earnestness
and
enthusiasm
and
at
once
began
to
teach
her
in
a
few
lessons
she
learned
nearly
all
of
the
english
sounds
and
in
less
than
a
month
she
was
able
to
articulate
a
great
many
words
distinctly
from
the
first
she
was
not
content
to
be
drilled
in
single
sounds
but
was
impatient
to
pronounce
words
and
sentences
the
length
of
the
word
or
the
difficulty
of
the
arrangement
of
the
elements
never
seemed
to
discourage
her
but
with
all
her
eagerness
and
intelligence
learning
to
speak
taxed
her
powers
to
the
utmost
but
there
was
satisfaction
in
seeing
from
day
to
day
the
evidence
of
growing
mastery
and
the
possibility
of
final
success
and
helen
success
has
been
more
complete
and
inspiring
than
any
of
her
friends
expected
and
the
child
delight
in
being
able
to
utter
her
thoughts
in
living
and
distinct
speech
is
shared
by
all
who
witness
her
pleasure
when
strangers
tell
her
that
they
understand
her
i
have
been
asked
a
great
many
times
whether
i
think
helen
will
ever
speak
naturally
that
is
as
other
people
speak
i
am
hardly
prepared
to
decide
that
question
or
even
give
an
opinion
regarding
it
i
believe
that
i
have
hardly
begun
yet
to
know
what
is
possible
teachers
of
the
deaf
often
express
surprise
that
helen
speech
is
so
good
when
she
has
not
received
any
regular
instruction
in
speech
since
the
first
few
lessons
given
her
by
miss
fuller
i
can
only
say
in
reply
this
is
due
to
habitual
imitation
and
practice
practice
practice
nature
has
determined
how
the
child
shall
learn
to
speak
and
all
we
can
do
is
to
aid
him
in
the
simplest
easiest
way
possible
by
encouraging
him
to
observe
and
imitate
the
vibrations
in
the
voice
some
further
details
appear
in
an
earlier
more
detailed
account
which
miss
sullivan
wrote
for
the
perkins
institution
report
of
i
knew
that
laura
bridgman
had
shown
the
same
intuitive
desire
to
produce
sounds
and
had
even
learned
to
pronounce
a
few
simple
words
which
she
took
great
delight
in
using
and
i
did
not
doubt
that
helen
could
accomplish
as
much
as
this
i
thought
however
that
the
advantage
she
would
derive
would
not
repay
her
for
the
time
and
labour
that
such
an
experiment
would
cost
moreover
the
absence
of
hearing
renders
the
voice
monotonous
and
often
very
disagreeable
and
such
speech
is
generally
unintelligible
except
to
those
familiar
with
the
speaker
the
acquiring
of
speech
by
untaught
deaf
children
is
always
slow
and
often
painful
too
much
stress
it
seems
to
me
is
often
laid
upon
the
importance
of
teaching
a
deaf
child
to
articulate
a
process
which
may
be
detrimental
to
the
pupil
intellectual
development
in
the
very
nature
of
things
articulation
is
an
unsatisfactory
means
of
education
while
the
use
of
the
manual
alphabet
quickens
and
invigorates
mental
activity
since
through
it
the
deaf
child
is
brought
into
close
contact
with
the
english
language
and
the
highest
and
most
abstract
ideas
may
be
conveyed
to
the
mind
readily
and
accurately
helen
case
proved
it
to
be
also
an
invaluable
aid
in
acquiring
articulation
she
was
already
perfectly
familiar
with
words
and
the
construction
of
sentences
and
had
only
mechanical
difficulties
to
overcome
moreover
she
knew
what
a
pleasure
speech
would
be
to
her
and
this
definite
knowledge
of
what
she
was
striving
for
gave
her
the
delight
of
anticipation
which
made
drudgery
easy
the
untaught
deaf
child
who
is
made
to
articulate
does
not
know
what
the
goal
is
and
his
lessons
in
speech
are
for
a
long
time
tedious
and
meaningless
before
describing
the
process
of
teaching
helen
to
speak
it
may
be
well
to
state
briefly
to
what
extent
she
had
used
the
vocal
organs
before
she
began
to
receive
regular
instruction
in
articulation
when
she
was
stricken
down
with
the
illness
which
resulted
in
her
loss
of
sight
and
hearing
at
the
age
of
nineteen
months
she
was
learning
to
talk
the
unmeaning
babblings
of
the
infant
were
becoming
day
by
day
conscious
and
voluntary
signs
of
what
she
felt
and
thought
but
the
disease
checked
her
progress
in
the
acquisition
of
oral
language
and
when
her
physical
strength
returned
it
was
found
that
she
had
ceased
to
speak
intelligibly
because
she
could
no
longer
hear
a
sound
she
continued
to
exercise
her
vocal
organs
mechanically
as
ordinary
children
do
her
cries
and
laughter
and
the
tones
of
her
voice
as
she
pronounced
many
word
elements
were
perfectly
natural
but
the
child
evidently
attached
no
significance
to
them
and
with
one
exception
they
were
produced
not
with
any
intention
of
communicating
with
those
around
her
but
from
the
sheer
necessity
of
exercising
her
innate
organic
and
hereditary
faculty
of
expression
she
always
attached
a
meaning
to
the
word
water
which
was
one
of
the
first
sounds
her
baby
lips
learned
to
form
and
it
was
the
only
word
which
she
continued
to
articulate
after
she
lost
her
hearing
her
pronunciation
of
this
gradually
became
indistinct
and
when
i
first
knew
her
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
peculiar
noise
nevertheless
it
was
the
only
sign
she
ever
made
for
water
and
not
until
she
had
learned
to
spell
the
word
with
her
fingers
did
she
forget
the
spoken
symbol
the
word
water
and
the
gesture
which
corresponds
to
the
word
seem
to
have
been
all
that
the
child
remembered
of
the
natural
and
acquired
signs
with
which
she
had
been
familiar
before
her
illness
as
she
became
acquainted
with
her
surroundings
through
the
sense
of
feeling
i
use
the
word
in
the
broadest
sense
as
including
all
tactile
impressions
she
felt
more
and
more
the
pressing
necessity
of
communicating
with
those
around
her
her
little
hands
felt
every
object
and
observed
every
movement
of
the
persons
about
her
and
she
was
quick
to
imitate
these
movements
she
was
thus
able
to
express
her
more
imperative
needs
and
many
of
her
thoughts
at
the
time
when
i
became
her
teacher
she
had
made
for
herself
upward
of
sixty
signs
all
of
which
were
imitative
and
were
readily
understood
by
those
who
knew
her
the
only
signs
which
i
think
she
may
have
invented
were
her
signs
for
small
and
large
whenever
she
wished
for
anything
very
much
she
would
gesticulate
in
a
very
expressive
manner
failing
to
make
herself
understood
she
would
become
violent
in
the
years
of
her
mental
imprisonment
she
depended
entirely
upon
signs
and
she
did
not
work
out
for
herself
any
sort
of
articulate
language
capable
of
expressing
ideas
it
seems
however
that
while
she
was
still
suffering
from
severe
pain
she
noticed
the
movements
of
her
lips
when
she
was
not
occupied
she
wandered
restlessly
about
the
house
making
strange
though
rarely
unpleasant
sounds
i
have
seen
her
rock
her
doll
making
a
continuous
monotonous
sound
keeping
one
hand
on
her
throat
while
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
noted
the
movements
of
her
lips
this
was
in
imitation
of
her
mother
crooning
to
the
baby
occasionally
she
broke
out
into
a
merry
laugh
and
then
she
would
reach
out
and
touch
the
mouth
of
any
one
who
happened
to
be
near
her
to
see
if
he
were
laughing
also
if
she
detected
no
smile
she
gesticulated
excitedly
trying
to
convey
her
thought
but
if
she
failed
to
make
her
companion
laugh
she
sat
still
for
a
few
moments
with
a
troubled
and
disappointed
expression
she
was
pleased
with
anything
which
made
a
noise
she
liked
to
feel
the
cat
purr
and
if
by
chance
she
felt
a
dog
in
the
act
of
barking
she
showed
great
pleasure
she
always
liked
to
stand
by
the
piano
when
some
one
was
playing
and
singing
she
kept
one
hand
on
the
singer
mouth
while
the
other
rested
on
the
piano
and
she
stood
in
this
position
as
long
as
any
one
would
sing
to
her
and
afterward
she
would
make
a
continuous
sound
which
she
called
singing
the
only
words
she
had
learned
to
pronounce
with
any
degree
of
distinctness
previous
to
march
were
papa
mamma
baby
sister
these
words
she
had
caught
without
instruction
from
the
lips
of
friends
it
will
be
seen
that
they
contain
three
vowel
and
six
consonant
elements
and
these
formed
the
foundation
for
her
first
real
lesson
in
speaking
at
the
end
of
the
first
lesson
she
was
able
to
pronounce
distinctly
the
following
sounds
a
a
e
i
o
c
soft
like
s
and
hard
like
k
g
hard
b
l
n
m
t
p
s
u
k
f
and
hard
consonants
were
and
indeed
still
are
very
difficult
for
her
to
pronounce
in
connection
with
one
another
in
the
same
word
she
often
suppresses
the
one
and
changes
the
other
and
sometimes
she
replaces
both
by
an
analogous
sound
with
soft
aspiration
the
confusion
between
l
and
r
was
very
noticeable
in
her
speech
at
first
she
would
repeatedly
use
one
for
the
other
the
great
difficulty
in
the
pronunciation
of
the
r
made
it
one
of
the
last
elements
which
she
mastered
the
ch
sh
and
soft
g
also
gave
her
much
trouble
and
she
does
not
yet
enunciate
them
clearly
the
difficulties
which
miss
sullivan
found
in
are
in
a
measure
the
difficulties
which
show
in
miss
keller
speech
today
when
she
had
been
talking
for
less
than
a
week
she
met
her
friend
rodocanachi
and
immediately
began
to
struggle
with
the
pronunciation
of
his
name
nor
would
she
give
it
up
until
she
was
able
to
articulate
the
word
distinctly
her
interest
never
diminished
for
a
moment
and
in
her
eagerness
to
overcome
the
difficulties
which
beset
her
on
all
sides
she
taxed
her
powers
to
the
utmost
and
learned
in
eleven
lessons
all
of
the
separate
elements
of
speech
enough
appears
in
the
accounts
by
miss
keller
teacher
to
show
the
process
by
which
she
reads
the
lips
with
her
fingers
the
process
by
which
she
was
taught
to
speak
and
by
which
of
course
she
can
listen
to
conversation
now
in
reading
the
lips
she
is
not
so
quick
or
so
accurate
as
some
reports
declare
it
is
a
clumsy
and
unsatisfactory
way
of
receiving
communication
useless
when
miss
sullivan
or
some
one
else
who
knows
the
manual
alphabet
is
present
to
give
miss
keller
the
spoken
words
of
others
indeed
when
some
friend
is
trying
to
speak
to
miss
keller
and
the
attempt
is
not
proving
successful
miss
sullivan
usually
helps
by
spelling
the
lost
words
into
miss
keller
hand
president
roosevelt
had
little
difficulty
last
spring
in
making
miss
keller
understand
him
and
especially
requested
miss
sullivan
not
to
spell
into
her
hand
she
got
every
word
for
the
president
speech
is
notably
distinct
other
people
say
they
have
no
success
in
making
miss
keller
hear
them
a
few
friends
to
whom
she
is
accustomed
like
pratt
and
chamberlin
can
pass
a
whole
day
with
her
and
tell
her
everything
without
the
manual
alphabet
the
ability
to
read
the
lips
helps
miss
keller
in
getting
corrections
of
her
pronunciation
from
miss
sullivan
and
others
just
as
it
was
the
means
of
her
learning
to
speak
at
all
but
it
is
rather
an
accomplishment
than
a
necessity
it
must
be
remembered
that
speech
contributed
in
no
way
to
her
fundamental
education
though
without
the
ability
to
speak
she
could
hardly
have
gone
to
higher
schools
and
to
college
but
she
knows
better
than
any
one
else
what
value
speech
has
had
for
her
the
following
is
her
address
at
the
fifth
meeting
of
the
american
association
to
promote
the
teaching
of
speech
to
the
deaf
at
mt
airy
philadelphia
pennsylvania
july
address
of
helen
keller
at
mt
airy
if
you
knew
all
the
joy
i
feel
in
being
able
to
speak
to
you
i
think
you
would
have
some
idea
of
the
value
of
speech
to
the
deaf
and
you
would
understand
why
i
want
every
little
deaf
child
in
all
this
great
world
to
have
an
opportunity
to
learn
to
speak
i
know
that
much
has
been
said
and
written
on
this
subject
and
that
there
is
a
wide
difference
of
opinion
among
teachers
of
the
deaf
in
regard
to
oral
instruction
it
seems
very
strange
to
me
that
there
should
be
this
difference
of
opinion
i
can
not
understand
how
any
one
interested
in
our
education
can
fail
to
appreciate
the
satisfaction
we
feel
in
being
able
to
express
our
thoughts
in
living
words
why
i
use
speech
constantly
and
i
can
not
begin
to
tell
you
how
much
pleasure
it
gives
me
to
do
so
of
course
i
know
that
it
is
not
always
easy
for
strangers
to
understand
me
but
it
will
be
by
and
by
and
in
the
meantime
i
have
the
unspeakable
happiness
of
knowing
that
my
family
and
friends
rejoice
in
my
ability
to
speak
my
little
sister
and
baby
brother
love
to
have
me
tell
them
stories
in
the
long
summer
evenings
when
i
am
at
home
and
my
mother
and
teacher
often
ask
me
to
read
to
them
from
my
favourite
books
i
also
discuss
the
political
situation
with
my
dear
father
and
we
decide
the
most
perplexing
questions
quite
as
satisfactorily
to
ourselves
as
if
i
could
see
and
hear
so
you
see
what
a
blessing
speech
is
to
me
it
brings
me
into
closer
and
tenderer
relationship
with
those
i
love
and
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
enjoy
the
sweet
companionship
of
a
great
many
persons
from
whom
i
should
be
entirely
cut
off
if
i
could
not
talk
i
can
remember
the
time
before
i
learned
to
speak
and
how
i
used
to
struggle
to
express
my
thoughts
by
means
of
the
manual
alphabet
how
my
thoughts
used
to
beat
against
my
finger
tips
like
little
birds
striving
to
gain
their
freedom
until
one
day
miss
fuller
opened
wide
the
and
let
them
escape
i
wonder
if
she
remembers
how
eagerly
and
gladly
they
spread
their
wings
and
flew
away
of
course
it
was
not
easy
at
first
to
fly
the
were
weak
and
broken
and
had
lost
all
the
grace
and
beauty
that
had
once
been
theirs
indeed
nothing
was
left
save
the
impulse
to
fly
but
that
was
something
one
can
never
consent
to
creep
when
one
feels
an
impulse
to
soar
but
nevertheless
it
seemed
to
me
sometimes
that
i
could
never
use
my
as
god
intended
i
should
use
them
there
were
so
many
difficulties
in
the
way
so
many
discouragements
but
i
kept
on
trying
knowing
that
patience
and
perseverance
would
win
in
the
end
and
while
i
worked
i
built
the
most
beautiful
and
dreamed
dreams
the
pleasantest
of
which
was
of
the
time
when
i
should
talk
like
other
people
and
the
thought
of
the
pleasure
it
would
give
my
mother
to
hear
my
voice
once
more
sweetened
every
effort
and
made
every
failure
an
incentive
to
try
harder
next
time
so
i
want
to
say
to
those
who
are
trying
to
learn
to
speak
and
those
who
are
teaching
them
be
of
good
cheer
do
not
think
of
failures
but
of
the
success
that
may
come
you
have
set
yourselves
a
difficult
task
but
you
will
succeed
if
you
persevere
and
you
will
find
a
joy
in
overcoming
obstacles
a
delight
in
climbing
rugged
paths
which
you
would
perhaps
never
know
if
you
did
not
sometime
slip
backward
if
the
road
was
always
smooth
and
pleasant
remember
no
effort
that
we
make
to
attain
something
beautiful
is
ever
lost
sometime
somewhere
somehow
we
shall
find
that
which
we
seek
we
shall
speak
yes
and
sing
too
as
god
intended
we
should
speak
and
sing
chapter
literary
style
no
one
can
have
read
miss
keller
autobiography
without
feeling
that
she
writes
unusually
fine
english
any
teacher
of
composition
knows
that
he
can
bring
his
pupils
to
the
point
of
writing
without
errors
in
syntax
or
in
the
choice
of
words
it
is
just
this
accuracy
which
miss
early
education
fixes
as
the
point
to
which
any
healthy
child
can
be
brought
and
which
the
analysis
of
that
education
accounts
for
those
who
try
to
make
her
an
exception
not
to
be
explained
by
any
such
analysis
of
her
early
education
fortify
their
position
by
an
appeal
to
the
remarkable
excellence
of
her
use
of
language
even
when
she
was
a
child
this
appeal
is
to
a
certain
degree
valid
for
indeed
those
additional
harmonies
of
language
and
beauties
of
thought
which
make
style
are
the
gifts
of
the
gods
no
teacher
could
have
made
helen
keller
sensitive
to
the
beauties
of
language
and
to
the
finer
interplay
of
thought
which
demands
expression
in
melodious
word
groupings
at
the
same
time
the
inborn
gift
of
style
can
be
starved
or
stimulated
no
innate
genius
can
invent
fine
language
the
stuff
of
which
good
style
is
made
must
be
given
to
the
mind
from
without
and
given
skilfully
a
child
of
the
muses
can
not
write
fine
english
unless
fine
english
has
been
its
nourishment
in
this
as
in
all
other
things
miss
sullivan
has
been
the
wise
teacher
if
she
had
not
had
taste
and
an
enthusiasm
for
good
english
helen
keller
might
have
been
brought
up
on
the
juvenile
literature
which
belittles
the
language
under
pretense
of
being
simply
phrased
for
children
as
if
a
child
book
could
not
like
treasure
island
or
robinson
crusoe
or
the
jungle
book
be
in
good
style
if
miss
sullivan
wrote
fine
english
the
beauty
of
helen
style
would
in
part
be
explicable
at
once
but
the
extracts
from
miss
sullivan
letters
and
from
her
reports
although
they
are
clear
and
accurate
have
not
the
beauty
which
distinguishes
miss
keller
english
her
service
as
a
teacher
of
english
is
not
to
be
measured
by
her
own
skill
in
composition
the
reason
why
she
read
to
her
pupil
so
many
good
books
is
due
in
some
measure
to
the
fact
that
she
had
so
recently
recovered
her
eyesight
when
she
became
helen
keller
teacher
she
was
just
awakening
to
the
good
things
that
are
in
books
from
which
she
had
been
shut
out
during
her
years
of
blindness
in
captain
keller
library
she
found
excellent
books
lamb
tales
from
shakespeare
and
better
still
montaigne
after
the
first
year
or
so
of
elementary
work
she
met
her
pupil
on
equal
terms
and
they
read
and
enjoyed
good
books
together
besides
the
selection
of
good
books
there
is
one
other
cause
for
miss
keller
excellence
in
writing
for
which
miss
sullivan
deserves
unlimited
credit
that
is
her
tireless
and
unrelenting
discipline
which
is
evident
in
all
her
work
she
never
allowed
her
pupil
to
send
off
letters
which
contained
offenses
against
taste
but
made
her
write
them
over
until
they
were
not
only
correct
but
charming
and
well
phrased
any
one
who
has
tried
to
write
knows
what
miss
keller
owes
to
the
endless
practice
which
miss
sullivan
demanded
of
her
let
a
teacher
with
a
liking
for
good
style
insist
on
a
child
writing
a
paragraph
over
and
over
again
until
it
is
more
than
correct
and
he
will
be
training
even
beyond
his
own
power
of
expression
the
power
of
expression
in
the
child
how
far
miss
sullivan
carried
this
process
of
refinement
and
selection
is
evident
from
the
humorous
comment
of
bell
that
she
made
her
pupil
a
little
old
woman
too
widely
different
from
ordinary
children
in
her
maturity
of
thought
when
bell
said
this
he
was
arguing
his
own
case
for
it
was
bell
who
first
saw
the
principles
that
underlie
miss
sullivan
method
and
explained
the
process
by
which
helen
keller
absorbed
language
from
books
there
is
moreover
a
reason
why
helen
keller
writes
good
english
which
lies
in
the
very
absence
of
sight
and
hearing
the
disadvantages
of
being
deaf
and
blind
were
overcome
and
the
advantages
remained
she
excels
other
deaf
people
because
she
was
taught
as
if
she
were
normal
on
the
other
hand
the
peculiar
value
to
her
of
language
which
ordinary
people
take
for
granted
as
a
necessary
part
of
them
like
their
right
hand
made
her
think
about
language
and
love
it
language
was
her
liberator
and
from
the
first
she
cherished
it
the
proof
of
miss
keller
early
skill
in
the
use
of
english
and
the
final
comment
on
the
excellence
of
this
whole
method
of
teaching
is
contained
in
an
incident
which
although
at
the
time
it
seemed
unfortunate
can
no
longer
be
regretted
i
refer
to
the
frost
king
episode
which
i
shall
explain
in
detail
miss
keller
has
given
her
account
of
it
and
the
whole
matter
was
discussed
in
the
first
volta
bureau
souvenir
from
which
i
quote
at
length
miss
sullivan
account
of
the
frost
king
hon
john
hitz
superintendent
of
the
volta
bureau
washington
dear
sir
since
my
paper
was
prepared
for
the
second
edition
of
the
souvenir
helen
keller
some
facts
have
been
brought
to
my
notice
which
are
of
interest
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
the
acquisition
of
language
by
my
pupil
and
if
it
is
not
already
too
late
for
publication
in
this
issue
of
the
souvenir
i
shall
be
glad
if
i
may
have
opportunity
to
explain
them
in
detail
perhaps
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
my
where
allusion
is
made
to
helen
remarkable
memory
it
is
noted
that
she
appears
to
retain
in
her
mind
many
forms
of
expression
which
at
the
time
they
are
received
she
probably
does
not
understand
but
when
further
information
is
acquired
the
language
retained
in
her
memory
finds
full
or
partial
expression
in
her
conversation
or
writing
according
as
it
proves
of
greater
or
less
value
to
her
in
the
fitness
of
its
application
to
the
new
experience
doubtless
this
is
true
in
the
case
of
every
intelligent
child
and
should
not
perhaps
be
considered
worthy
of
especial
mention
in
helen
case
but
for
the
fact
that
a
child
who
is
deprived
of
the
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
might
not
be
expected
to
be
as
gifted
mentally
as
this
little
girl
proves
to
be
hence
it
is
quite
possible
we
may
be
inclined
to
class
as
marvelous
many
things
we
discover
in
the
development
of
her
mind
which
do
not
merit
such
an
explanation
in
this
paper
miss
sullivan
says
during
this
winter
i
went
with
her
into
the
yard
while
a
light
snow
was
falling
and
let
her
feel
the
falling
flakes
she
appeared
to
enjoy
it
very
much
indeed
as
we
went
in
she
repeated
these
words
of
the
of
his
garments
winter
shakes
the
snow
i
inquired
of
her
where
she
had
read
this
she
did
not
remember
having
read
it
did
not
seem
to
know
that
she
had
learned
it
as
i
had
never
heard
it
i
inquired
of
several
of
my
friends
if
they
recalled
the
words
no
one
seemed
to
remember
it
the
teachers
at
the
institution
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
description
did
not
appear
in
any
book
in
raised
print
in
that
library
but
one
lady
miss
marrett
took
upon
herself
the
task
of
examining
books
of
poems
in
ordinary
type
and
was
rewarded
by
finding
the
following
lines
in
one
of
longfellow
minor
poems
entitled
of
the
bosom
of
the
air
out
of
the
of
her
garments
shaken
over
the
woodlands
brown
and
bare
over
the
forsaken
silent
and
soft
and
slow
descends
the
snow
it
would
seem
that
helen
had
learned
and
treasured
the
memory
of
this
expression
of
the
poet
and
this
morning
in
the
had
found
its
application
in
the
hope
that
i
may
be
pardoned
if
i
appear
to
overestimate
the
remarkable
mental
capacity
and
power
of
comprehension
and
discrimination
which
my
pupil
possesses
i
wish
to
add
that
while
i
have
always
known
that
helen
made
great
use
of
such
descriptions
and
comparisons
as
appeal
to
her
imagination
and
fine
poetic
nature
yet
recent
developments
in
her
writings
convince
me
of
the
fact
that
i
have
not
in
the
past
been
fully
aware
to
what
extent
she
absorbs
the
language
of
her
favourite
authors
in
the
early
part
of
her
education
i
had
full
knowledge
of
all
the
books
she
read
and
of
nearly
all
the
stories
which
were
read
to
her
and
could
without
difficulty
trace
the
source
of
any
adaptations
noted
in
her
writing
or
conversation
and
i
have
always
been
much
pleased
to
observe
how
appropriately
she
applies
the
expressions
of
a
favourite
author
in
her
own
compositions
the
following
extracts
from
a
few
of
her
published
letters
give
evidence
of
how
valuable
this
power
of
retaining
the
memory
of
beautiful
language
has
been
to
her
one
warm
sunny
day
in
early
spring
when
we
were
at
the
north
the
balmy
atmosphere
appears
to
have
brought
to
her
mind
the
sentiment
expressed
by
longfellow
in
hiawatha
and
she
almost
sings
with
the
poet
the
ground
was
all
aquiver
with
the
stir
of
new
life
my
heart
sang
for
very
joy
i
thought
of
my
own
dear
home
i
knew
that
in
that
sunny
land
spring
had
come
in
all
its
splendour
its
birds
and
all
its
blossoms
all
its
flowers
and
all
its
grasses
about
the
same
time
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
in
which
she
makes
mention
of
her
southern
home
she
gives
so
close
a
reproduction
from
a
poem
by
one
of
her
favourite
authors
that
i
will
give
extracts
from
letter
and
from
the
poem
itself
extracts
from
helen
letter
the
entire
letter
is
published
on
pp
and
of
the
report
of
the
perkins
institution
for
the
with
his
azure
plumes

thrush
clad
all
in
brown
the

jerking
his
spasmodic
throat
the
oriole

a
flake

the
jolly
bobolink
and
his
happy
mate
the
imitating
the
notes
of
all
the
with
his
one
sweet
trill
and
the
busy
little
wren
are
all
making
the
trees
in
our
front
yard
ring
with
their
glad
song
from
the
poem
entitled
spring
by
oliver
wendell
holmes
the
bluebird
breathing
from
his
azure
plumes
the
fragrance
borrowed
from
the
myrtle
blooms
the
thrush
poor
wanderer
dropping
meekly
down
clad
in
his
remnant
of
autumnal
brown
the
oriole

like
a
flake

fire
rent
by
a
whirlwind
from
a
blazing
spire
the
robin
jerking

spasmodic
throat
repeats
imperious
his
staccato
note
the
bobolink

crazy
mate
poised
on

bullrush
tipsy
with
his
weight
nay
in
his
cage
the
lone
canary
sings
feels
the
soft
air
and
spreads
his
idle
wings
on
the
last
day
of
april
she
uses
another
expression
from
the
same
poem
which
is
more
an
adaptation
than
a
reproduction
april
will
hide
her
tears
and
blushes
beneath
the
flowers
of
lovely
may
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
at
the
perkins
institution
dated
may
she
gives
a
reproduction
from
one
of
hans
christian
andersen
stories
which
i
had
read
to
her
not
long
before
this
letter
is
published
in
the
perkins
institution
report
the
original
story
was
read
to
her
from
a
copy
of
andersen
stories
published
by
leavitt
allen
and
may
be
found
on
of
part
in
that
volume
her
admiration
for
the
impressive
explanations
which
bishop
brooks
has
given
her
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
is
well
known
in
one
of
his
letters
speaking
of
how
god
in
every
way
tells
us
of
his
love
he
says
i
think
he
writes
it
even
upon
the
walls
of
the
great
house
of
nature
which
we
live
in
that
he
is
our
father
the
next
year
at
andover
she
said
it
seems
to
me
the
world
is
full
of
goodness
beauty
and
love
and
how
grateful
we
must
be
to
our
heavenly
father
who
has
given
us
so
much
to
enjoy
his
love
and
care
are
written
all
over
the
walls
of
nature
in
these
later
years
since
helen
has
come
in
contact
with
so
many
persons
who
are
able
to
converse
freely
with
her
she
has
made
the
acquaintance
of
some
literature
with
which
i
am
not
familiar
she
has
also
found
in
books
printed
in
raised
letters
in
the
reading
of
which
i
have
been
unable
to
follow
her
much
material
for
the
cultivation
of
the
taste
she
possesses
for
poetical
imagery
the
pages
of
the
book
she
reads
become
to
her
like
paintings
to
which
her
imaginative
powers
give
life
and
colour
she
is
at
once
transported
into
the
midst
of
the
events
portrayed
in
the
story
she
reads
or
is
told
and
the
characters
and
descriptions
become
real
to
her
she
rejoices
when
justice
wins
and
is
sad
when
virtue
goes
unrewarded
the
pictures
the
language
paints
on
her
memory
appear
to
make
an
indelible
impression
and
many
times
when
an
experience
comes
to
her
similar
in
character
the
language
starts
forth
with
wonderful
accuracy
like
the
reflection
from
a
mirror
helen
mind
is
so
gifted
by
nature
that
she
seems
able
to
understand
with
only
the
faintest
touch
of
explanation
every
possible
variety
of
external
relations
one
day
in
alabama
as
we
were
gathering
wild
flowers
near
the
springs
on
the
hillsides
she
seemed
to
understand
for
the
first
time
that
the
springs
were
surrounded
by
mountains
and
she
exclaimed
the
mountains
are
crowding
around
the
springs
to
look
at
their
own
beautiful
reflections
i
do
not
know
where
she
obtained
this
language
yet
it
is
evident
that
it
must
have
come
to
her
from
without
as
it
would
hardly
be
possible
for
a
person
deprived
of
the
visual
sense
to
originate
such
an
idea
in
mentioning
a
visit
to
lexington
she
writes
as
we
rode
along
we
could
see
the
forest
monarchs
bend
their
proud
forms
to
listen
to
the
little
children
of
the
woodlands
whispering
their
secrets
the
anemone
the
wild
violet
the
hepatica
and
the
funny
little
ferns
all
peeped
out
at
us
from
beneath
the
brown
leaves
she
closes
this
letter
with
i
must
go
to
bed
for
morpheus
has
touched
my
eyelids
with
his
golden
wand
here
again
i
am
unable
to
state
where
she
acquired
these
expressions
she
has
always
seemed
to
prefer
stories
which
exercise
the
imagination
and
catches
and
retains
the
poetic
spirit
in
all
such
literature
but
not
until
this
winter
have
i
been
conscious
that
her
memory
absorbed
the
exact
language
to
such
an
extent
that
she
is
herself
unable
to
trace
the
source
this
is
shown
in
a
little
story
she
wrote
in
october
last
at
the
home
of
her
parents
in
tuscumbia
which
she
called
autumn
leaves
she
was
at
work
upon
it
about
two
weeks
writing
a
little
each
day
at
her
own
pleasure
when
it
was
finished
and
we
read
it
in
the
family
it
occasioned
much
comment
on
account
of
the
beautiful
imagery
and
we
could
not
understand
how
helen
could
describe
such
pictures
without
the
aid
of
sight
as
we
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
any
such
story
as
this
before
we
inquired
of
her
where
she
read
it
she
replied
i
did
not
read
it
it
is
my
story
for
anagnos
birthday
while
i
was
surprised
that
she
could
write
like
this
i
was
not
more
astonished
than
i
had
been
many
times
before
at
the
unexpected
achievements
of
my
little
pupil
especially
as
we
had
exchanged
many
beautiful
thoughts
on
the
subject
of
the
glory
of
the
ripening
foliage
during
the
autumn
of
this
year
before
helen
made
her
final
copy
of
the
story
it
was
suggested
to
her
to
change
its
title
to
the
frost
king
as
more
appropriate
to
the
subject
of
which
the
story
treated
to
this
she
willingly
assented
the
story
was
written
by
helen
in
braille
as
usual
and
copied
by
her
in
the
same
manner
i
then
interlined
the
manuscript
for
the
greater
convenience
of
those
who
desired
to
read
it
helen
wrote
a
little
letter
and
enclosing
the
manuscript
forwarded
both
by
mail
to
anagnos
for
his
birthday
the
story
was
printed
in
the
january
number
of
the
mentor
and
from
a
review
of
it
in
the
goodson
gazette
i
was
startled
to
find
that
a
very
similar
story
had
been
published
in
seven
years
before
helen
was
born
this
story
frost
fairies
appeared
in
a
book
written
by
miss
margaret
canby
entitled
birdie
and
his
fairy
friends
the
passages
quoted
from
the
two
stories
were
so
much
alike
in
thought
and
expression
as
to
convince
me
that
miss
canby
story
must
at
some
time
have
been
read
to
helen
as
i
had
never
read
this
story
or
even
heard
of
the
book
i
inquired
of
helen
if
she
knew
anything
about
the
matter
and
found
she
did
not
she
was
utterly
unable
to
recall
either
the
name
of
the
story
or
the
book
careful
examination
was
made
of
the
books
in
raised
print
in
the
library
of
the
perkins
institution
to
learn
if
any
extracts
from
this
volume
could
be
found
there
but
nothing
was
discovered
i
then
concluded
that
the
story
must
have
been
read
to
her
a
long
time
ago
as
her
memory
usually
retains
with
great
distinctness
facts
and
impressions
which
have
been
committed
to
its
keeping
after
making
careful
inquiry
i
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
information
that
our
friend
hopkins
had
a
copy
of
this
book
in
which
was
presented
to
her
little
daughter
in
or
helen
and
i
spent
the
summer
of
with
hopkins
at
her
home
in
brewster
where
she
kindly
relieved
me
a
part
of
the
time
of
the
care
of
helen
she
amused
and
entertained
helen
by
reading
to
her
from
a
collection
of
juvenile
publications
among
which
was
the
copy
of
birdie
and
his
fairy
friends
and
while
hopkins
does
not
remember
this
story
of
frost
fairies
she
is
confident
that
she
read
to
helen
extracts
if
not
entire
stories
from
this
volume
but
as
she
was
not
able
to
find
her
copy
and
applications
for
the
volume
at
bookstores
in
boston
new
york
philadelphia
albany
and
other
places
resulted
only
in
failure
search
was
instituted
for
the
author
herself
this
became
a
difficult
task
as
her
publishers
in
philadelphia
had
retired
from
business
many
years
ago
however
it
was
eventually
discovered
that
her
residence
is
at
wilmington
delaware
and
copies
of
the
second
edition
of
the
book
were
obtained
from
her
she
has
since
secured
and
forwarded
to
me
a
copy
of
the
first
edition
the
most
generous
and
gratifying
letters
have
been
received
from
miss
canby
by
helen
friends
a
few
extracts
from
which
are
given
under
date
of
february
after
mentioning
the
order
of
the
publication
of
the
stories
in
the
magazine
she
writes
all
the
stories
were
revised
before
publishing
them
in
book
form
additions
were
made
to
the
number
as
first
published
i
think
and
some
of
the
titles
may
have
been
changed
in
the
same
letter
she
writes
i
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
make
her
understand
that
i
am
glad
she
enjoyed
my
story
and
that
i
hope
the
new
book
will
give
her
pleasure
by
renewing
her
friendship
with
the
fairies
i
shall
write
to
her
in
a
short
time
i
am
so
much
impressed
with
what
i
have
learned
of
her
that
i
have
written
a
little
poem
entitled
a
silent
singer
which
i
may
send
to
her
mother
after
a
while
can
you
tell
me
in
what
paper
the
article
appeared
accusing
helen
of
plagiarism
and
giving
passages
from
both
stories
i
should
like
much
to
see
it
and
to
obtain
a
few
copies
if
possible
under
date
of
march
miss
canby
writes
i
find
traces
in
the
report
which
you
so
kindly
sent
me
of
little
helen
having
heard
other
stories
than
that
of
fairies
on
page
in
a
letter
there
is
a
passage
which
must
have
been
suggested
by
my
story
called
rose
fairies
see
pp
of
and
on
pages
and
of
the
report
the
description
of
a
thunderstorm
is
very
much
like
birdie
idea
of
the
same
in
the
fairies
on
page
and
of
my
book
what
a
wonderfully
active
and
retentive
mind
that
gifted
child
must
have
if
she
had
remembered
and
written
down
accurately
a
short
story
and
that
soon
after
hearing
it
it
would
have
been
a
marvel
but
to
have
heard
the
story
once
three
years
ago
and
in
such
a
way
that
neither
her
parents
nor
teacher
could
ever
allude
to
it
or
refresh
her
memory
about
it
and
then
to
have
been
able
to
reproduce
it
so
vividly
even
adding
some
touches
of
her
own
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
rest
which
really
improve
the
original
is
something
that
very
few
girls
of
riper
age
and
with
every
advantage
of
sight
hearing
and
even
great
talents
for
composition
could
have
done
as
well
if
at
all
under
the
circumstances
i
do
not
see
how
any
one
can
be
so
unkind
as
to
call
it
a
plagiarism
it
is
a
wonderful
feat
of
memory
and
stands
alone
as
doubtless
much
of
her
work
will
in
future
if
her
mental
powers
grow
and
develop
with
her
years
as
greatly
as
in
the
few
years
past
i
have
known
many
children
well
have
been
surrounded
by
them
all
my
life
and
love
nothing
better
than
to
talk
with
them
amuse
them
and
quietly
notice
their
traits
of
mind
and
character
but
i
do
not
recollect
more
than
one
girl
of
helen
age
who
had
the
love
and
thirst
for
knowledge
and
the
store
of
literary
and
general
information
and
the
skill
in
composition
which
helen
possesses
she
is
indeed
a
thank
you
very
much
for
the
report
gazette
and
helen
journal
the
last
made
me
realize
the
great
disappointment
to
the
dear
child
more
than
before
please
give
her
my
warm
love
and
tell
her
not
to
feel
troubled
about
it
any
more
no
one
shall
be
allowed
to
think
it
was
anything
wrong
and
some
day
she
will
write
a
great
beautiful
story
or
poem
that
will
make
many
people
happy
tell
her
there
are
a
few
bitter
drops
in
every
cup
and
the
only
way
is
to
take
the
bitter
patiently
and
the
sweet
thankfully
i
shall
love
to
hear
of
her
reception
of
the
book
and
how
she
likes
the
stories
which
are
new
to
her
i
have
now
march
read
to
helen
the
frost
fairies
the
rose
fairies
and
a
portion
of
the
dew
fairies
but
she
is
unable
to
throw
any
light
on
the
matter
she
recognized
them
at
once
as
her
own
stories
with
variations
and
was
much
puzzled
to
know
how
they
could
have
been
published
before
she
was
born
she
thinks
it
is
wonderful
that
two
people
should
write
stories
so
much
alike
but
she
still
considers
her
own
as
original
i
give
below
a
portion
of
miss
canby
story
the
rose
fairies
and
also
helen
letter
to
anagnos
containing
her
dream
so
that
the
likenesses
and
differences
may
be
studied
by
those
interested
in
the
subject
the
rose
fairies
from
birdie
and
his
fairy
friends
by
margaret
canby
one
pleasant
morning
little
birdie
might
have
been
seen
sitting
quietly
on
the
at
the
side
of
his
mother
house
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
it
was
quite
early
great
sun
who
is
such
an
early
riser
in
summer
time
had
not
been
up
very
long
the
birds
were
just
beginning
to
chirp
their
to
each
other
and
as
for
the
flowers
they
were
still
asleep
but
birdie
was
so
busy
all
day
trotting
about
the
house
and
garden
that
he
was
always
ready
for
his
nest
at
night
before
the
birds
and
flowers
had
thought
of
seeking
theirs
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
when
sun
raised
his
head
above
the
green
woods
and
smiled
lovingly
upon
the
earth
birdie
was
often
the
first
to
see
him
and
to
smile
back
at
him
all
the
while
rubbing
his
eyes
with
his
dimpled
fists
until
between
smiling
and
rubbing
he
was
wide
awake
and
what
do
you
think
he
did
next
why
the
little
rogue
rolled
into
his
mamma
bed
and
kissed
her
eyelids
her
cheeks
and
her
mouth
until
she
began
to
dream
that
it
was
raining
kisses
and
at
last
she
opened
her
eyes
to
see
what
it
all
meant
and
found
that
it
was
birdie
trying
to
kiss
her
awake
as
he
said
she
loved
her
little
boy
very
dearly
and
liked
to
make
him
happy
and
when
he
said
please
dress
me
dear
mamma
and
let
me
go
out
to
play
in
the
garden
she
cheerfully
consented
and
soon
after
birdie
went
downstairs
in
his
of
cool
linen
and
with
his
round
face
bright
and
rosy
from
its
bath
and
ran
out
on
the
gravel
path
to
play
until
breakfast
was
ready
he
stood
still
a
moment
to
look
about
him
and
think
what
he
should
do
first
the
fresh
morning
air
blew
softly
in
his
face
as
if
to
welcome
him
and
be
his
merry
playmate
and
the
bright
eye
of
sun
looked
at
him
with
a
warm
and
glowing
smile
but
birdie
soon
walked
on
to
find
something
to
play
with
as
he
came
in
sight
of
the
that
grew
near
the
side
of
the
house
he
suddenly
clapped
his
hands
and
with
a
little
shout
of
joy
stopped
to
look
at
them
they
were
all
covered
with
lovely
rosebuds
some
were
red
some
white
and
others
pale
pink
and
they
were
just
peeping
out
of
the
green
leaves
as
children
peep
out
from
their
warm
beds
in
wintertime
before
they
are
quite
willing
to
get
up
a
few
days
before
birdie
papa
had
told
him
that
the
green
balls
on
the
had
beautiful
flowers
shut
up
within
them
but
the
little
boy
found
it
hard
to
believe
for
he
was
so
young
that
he
did
not
remember
how
pretty
the
roses
had
been
the
summer
before
now
he
found
out
that
his
father
words
were
true
for
a
few
days
of
warm
weather
had
turned
the
green
balls
into
rosebuds
and
they
were
so
beautiful
that
it
was
enough
to
make
birdie
stand
still
before
them
his
blue
eyes
dancing
with
delight
and
his
little
hands
clasped
tightly
together
after
awhile
he
went
nearer
and
looking
closely
at
the
buds
found
that
they
were
folded
up
leaf
over
leaf
as
eyelids
are
folded
over
sleeping
eyes
so
that
birdie
thought
they
must
be
asleep
lazy
roses
wake
up
said
he
giving
the
branches
a
gentle
shake
but
only
the
dew
fell
off
in
bright
drops
and
the
flowers
were
still
shut
up
at
last
birdie
remembered
how
he
had
awakened
his
mother
with
kisses
and
thought
he
would
try
the
same
plan
with
the
roses
so
he
drew
up
his
red
lips
until
they
looked
like
a
rosebud
too
and
bending
down
a
branch
with
a
lovely
pink
bud
upon
it
he
kissed
it
softly
two
or
three
times
here
the
similarity
in
the
language
of
the
story
to
that
in
the
letter
ceases
helen
letter
to
anagnos
written
february
and
this
letter
was
enclosed
in
another
written
in
french
dated
le
fevrier
my
dear
anagnos
you
will
laugh
when
you
open
your
little
letter
and
see
all
the
queer
mistakes
she
has
made
in
french
but
i
think
you
will
be
pleased
to
know
that
i
can
write
even
a
short
letter
in
french
it
makes
me
very
happy
to
please
you
and
my
dear
teacher
i
wish
i
could
see
your
little
niece
amelia
i
am
sure
we
should
love
each
other
i
hope
you
will
bring
some
of
virginia
evanghelides
poems
home
with
you
and
translate
them
for
me
teacher
and
i
have
just
returned
from
our
walk
it
is
a
beautiful
day
we
met
a
sweet
little
child
she
was
playing
on
the
pier
with
a
wee
brother
she
gave
me
a
kiss
and
then
ran
away
because
she
was
a
shy
little
girl
i
wonder
if
you
would
like
to
have
me
tell
you
a
pretty
dream
which
i
had
a
long
time
ago
when
i
was
a
very
little
child
teacher
says
it
was
a
and
she
thinks
you
would
be
delighted
to
hear
it
one
pleasant
morning
in
the
beautiful
springtime
i
thought
i
was
sitting
on
the
soft
grass
under
my
dear
mother
window
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
which
were
growing
all
around
me
it
was
quite
early
the
sun
had
not
been
up
very
long
the
birds
were
just
beginning
to
sing
joyously
the
flowers
were
still
asleep
they
would
not
awake
until
the
sun
had
smiled
lovingly
upon
them
i
was
a
very
happy
little
child
with
rosy
cheeks
and
large
blue
eyes
and
the
most
beautiful
golden
ringlets
you
can
imagine
the
fresh
morning
air
blew
gently
in
my
face
as
if
to
welcome
me
and
be
my
merry
playmate
and
the
sun
looked
at
me
with
a
warm
and
tender
smile
i
clapped
my
chubby
hands
for
joy
when
i
saw
that
the
were
covered
with
lovely
buds
some
were
red
some
white
and
others
were
delicate
pink
and
they
were
peeping
out
from
between
the
green
leaves
like
beautiful
little
fairies
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
lovely
before
for
i
was
very
young
and
i
could
not
remember
how
pretty
the
roses
had
been
the
summer
before
my
little
heart
was
filled
with
a
sweet
joy
and
i
danced
around
the
rosebushes
to
show
my
delight
after
a
while
i
went
very
near
to
a
beautiful
white
which
was
completely
covered
with
buds
and
sparkling
with
dewdrops
i
bent
down
one
of
the
branches
with
a
lovely
pure
white
bud
upon
it
and
kissed
it
softly
many
times
just
then
i
felt
two
loving
arms
steal
gently
around
me
and
loving
lips
kissing
my
eyelids
my
cheeks
and
my
mouth
until
i
began
to
think
it
was
raining
kisses
and
at
last
i
opened
my
eyes
to
see
what
it
all
meant
and
found
it
was
my
precious
mother
who
was
bending
over
me
trying
to
kiss
me
awake
do
you
like
my
if
you
do
perhaps
i
will
dream
again
for
you
some
time
teacher
and
all
of
your
friends
send
you
their
love
i
shall
be
so
glad
when
you
come
home
for
i
greatly
miss
you
please
give
my
love
to
your
good
greek
friends
and
tell
them
that
i
shall
come
to
athens
some
day
lovingly
your
little
friend
and
playmate
helen
keller
the
frost
fairies
and
the
frost
kings
are
given
in
full
as
the
differences
are
as
important
as
the
resemblances
the
frost
fairies
from
birdie
and
his
fairy
friends
by
margaret
canby
king
frost
or
jack
frost
as
he
is
sometimes
called
lives
in
a
cold
country
far
to
the
north
but
every
year
he
takes
a
journey
over
the
world
in
a
car
of
golden
clouds
drawn
by
a
strong
and
rapid
steed
called
north
wind
wherever
he
goes
he
does
many
wonderful
things
he
builds
bridges
over
every
stream
clear
as
glass
in
appearance
but
often
strong
as
iron
he
puts
the
flowers
and
plants
to
sleep
by
one
touch
of
his
hand
and
they
all
bow
down
and
sink
into
the
warm
earth
until
spring
returns
then
lest
we
should
grieve
for
the
flowers
he
places
at
our
windows
lovely
wreaths
and
sprays
of
his
white
northern
flowers
or
delicate
little
forests
of
fairy
pure
white
and
very
beautiful
but
his
most
wonderful
work
is
the
painting
of
the
trees
which
look
after
his
task
is
done
as
if
they
were
covered
with
the
brightest
layers
of
gold
and
rubies
and
are
beautiful
enough
to
comfort
us
for
the
flight
of
summer
i
will
tell
you
how
king
frost
first
thought
of
this
kind
work
for
it
is
a
strange
story
you
must
know
that
this
king
like
all
other
kings
has
great
treasures
of
gold
and
precious
stones
in
his
palace
but
being
a
old
fellow
he
does
not
keep
his
riches
locked
up
all
the
time
but
tries
to
do
good
and
make
others
happy
with
them
he
has
two
neighbours
who
live
still
farther
north
one
is
king
winter
a
cross
and
churlish
old
monarch
who
is
hard
and
cruel
and
delights
in
making
the
poor
suffer
and
weep
but
the
other
neighbour
is
santa
claus
a
fine
jolly
old
soul
who
loves
to
do
good
and
who
brings
presents
to
the
poor
and
to
nice
little
children
at
christmas
well
one
day
king
frost
was
trying
to
think
of
some
good
that
he
could
do
with
his
treasure
and
suddenly
he
concluded
to
send
some
of
it
to
his
kind
neighbour
santa
claus
to
buy
presents
of
food
and
clothing
for
the
poor
that
they
might
not
suffer
so
much
when
king
winter
went
near
their
homes
so
he
called
together
his
merry
little
fairies
and
showing
them
a
number
of
jars
and
vases
filled
with
gold
and
precious
stones
told
them
to
carry
those
carefully
to
the
palace
of
santa
claus
and
give
them
to
him
with
the
compliments
of
king
frost
he
will
know
how
to
make
good
use
of
the
treasure
added
jack
frost
then
he
told
the
fairies
not
to
loiter
by
the
way
but
to
do
his
bidding
quickly
the
fairies
promised
obedience
and
soon
started
on
their
journey
dragging
the
great
glass
jars
and
vases
along
as
well
as
they
could
and
now
and
then
grumbling
a
little
at
having
such
hard
work
to
do
for
they
were
idle
fairies
and
liked
play
better
than
work
at
last
they
reached
a
great
forest
and
being
quite
tired
they
decided
to
rest
awhile
and
look
for
nuts
before
going
any
further
but
lest
the
treasure
should
be
stolen
from
them
they
hid
the
jars
among
the
thick
leaves
of
the
forest
trees
placing
some
high
up
near
the
top
and
others
in
different
parts
of
the
various
trees
until
they
thought
no
one
could
find
them
then
they
began
to
wander
about
and
hunt
for
nuts
and
climb
the
trees
to
shake
them
down
and
worked
much
harder
for
their
own
pleasure
than
they
had
done
for
their
master
bidding
for
it
is
a
strange
truth
that
fairies
and
children
never
complain
of
the
toil
and
trouble
they
take
in
search
of
amusement
although
they
often
grumble
when
asked
to
work
for
the
good
of
others
the
frost
fairies
were
so
busy
and
so
merry
over
their
nutting
frolic
that
they
soon
forgot
their
errand
and
their
king
command
to
go
quickly
but
as
they
played
and
loitered
in
the
forest
until
noon
they
found
the
reason
why
they
were
told
to
hasten
for
although
they
had
as
they
thought
hidden
the
treasure
so
carefully
they
had
not
secured
it
from
the
power
of
sun
who
was
an
enemy
of
jack
frost
and
delighted
to
undo
his
work
and
weaken
him
whenever
he
could
his
bright
eyes
found
out
the
jars
of
treasure
among
the
trees
and
as
the
idle
fairies
left
them
there
until
noon
at
which
time
sun
is
the
strongest
the
delicate
glass
began
to
melt
and
break
and
before
long
every
jar
and
vase
was
cracked
or
broken
and
the
precious
treasures
they
contained
were
melting
too
and
dripping
slowly
in
streams
of
gold
and
crimson
over
the
trees
and
bushes
of
the
forest
still
for
awhile
the
frost
fairies
did
not
notice
this
strange
occurrence
for
they
were
down
on
the
grass
so
far
below
the
that
the
wonderful
shower
of
treasure
was
a
long
time
in
reaching
them
but
at
last
one
of
them
said
hark
i
believe
it
is
raining
i
certainly
hear
the
falling
drops
the
others
laughed
and
told
him
that
it
seldom
rained
when
the
sun
was
shining
but
as
they
listened
they
plainly
heard
the
tinkling
of
many
drops
falling
through
the
forest
and
sliding
from
leaf
to
leaf
until
they
reached
the
beside
them
when
to
their
great
dismay
they
found
that
the
were
melted
rubies
which
hardened
on
the
leaves
and
turned
them
to
bright
crimson
in
a
moment
then
looking
more
closely
at
the
trees
around
they
saw
that
the
treasure
was
all
melting
away
and
that
much
of
it
was
already
spread
over
the
leaves
of
the
oak
trees
and
maples
which
were
shining
with
their
gorgeous
dress
of
gold
and
bronze
crimson
and
emerald
it
was
very
beautiful
but
the
idle
fairies
were
too
much
frightened
at
the
mischief
their
disobedience
had
caused
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
forest
and
at
once
tried
to
hide
themselves
among
the
bushes
lest
king
frost
should
come
and
punish
them
their
fears
were
well
founded
for
their
long
absence
had
alarmed
the
king
and
he
had
started
out
to
look
for
his
tardy
servants
and
just
as
they
were
all
hidden
he
came
along
slowly
looking
on
all
sides
for
the
fairies
of
course
he
soon
noticed
the
brightness
of
the
leaves
and
discovered
the
cause
too
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
broken
jars
and
vases
from
which
the
melted
treasure
was
still
dropping
and
when
he
came
to
the
nut
trees
and
saw
the
shells
left
by
the
idle
fairies
and
all
the
traces
of
their
frolic
he
knew
exactly
how
they
had
acted
and
that
they
had
disobeyed
him
by
playing
and
loitering
on
their
way
through
the
woods
king
frost
frowned
and
looked
very
angry
at
first
and
his
fairies
trembled
for
fear
and
cowered
still
lower
in
their
but
just
then
two
little
children
came
dancing
through
the
wood
and
though
they
did
not
see
king
frost
or
the
fairies
they
saw
the
beautiful
colour
of
the
leaves
and
laughed
with
delight
and
began
picking
great
bunches
to
take
to
their
mother
the
leaves
are
as
pretty
as
flowers
said
they
and
they
called
the
golden
leaves
buttercups
and
the
red
ones
roses
and
were
very
happy
as
they
went
singing
through
the
wood
their
pleasure
charmed
away
king
frost
anger
and
he
too
began
to
admire
the
painted
trees
and
at
last
he
said
to
himself
my
treasures
are
not
wasted
if
they
make
little
children
happy
i
will
not
be
offended
at
my
idle
thoughtless
fairies
for
they
have
taught
me
a
new
way
of
doing
good
when
the
frost
fairies
heard
these
words
they
crept
one
by
one
from
their
corners
and
kneeling
down
before
their
master
confessed
their
fault
and
asked
his
pardon
he
frowned
upon
them
for
awhile
and
scolded
them
too
but
he
soon
relented
and
said
he
would
forgive
them
this
time
and
would
only
punish
them
by
making
them
carry
more
treasure
to
the
forest
and
hide
it
in
the
trees
until
all
the
leaves
with
sun
help
were
covered
with
gold
and
ruby
coats
then
the
fairies
thanked
him
for
his
forgiveness
and
promised
to
work
very
hard
to
please
him
and
the
king
took
them
all
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
them
safely
home
to
his
palace
from
that
time
i
suppose
it
has
been
part
of
jack
frost
work
to
paint
the
trees
with
the
glowing
colours
we
see
in
the
autumn
and
if
they
are
not
covered
with
gold
and
precious
stones
i
do
not
know
how
he
makes
them
so
bright
do
you
the
frost
king
by
helen
keller
king
frost
lives
in
a
beautiful
palace
far
to
the
north
in
the
land
of
perpetual
snow
the
palace
which
is
magnificent
beyond
description
was
built
centuries
ago
in
the
reign
of
king
glacier
at
a
little
distance
from
the
palace
we
might
easily
mistake
it
for
a
mountain
whose
peaks
were
mounting
heavenward
to
receive
the
last
kiss
of
the
departing
day
but
on
nearer
approach
we
should
discover
our
error
what
we
had
supposed
to
be
peaks
were
in
reality
a
thousand
glittering
spires
nothing
could
be
more
beautiful
than
the
architecture
of
this
the
walls
are
curiously
constructed
of
massive
blocks
of
ice
which
terminate
in
towers
the
entrance
to
the
palace
is
at
the
end
of
an
arched
recess
and
it
is
guarded
night
and
day
by
twelve
white
bears
but
children
you
must
make
king
frost
a
visit
the
very
first
opportunity
you
have
and
see
for
yourselves
this
wonderful
palace
the
old
king
will
welcome
you
kindly
for
he
loves
children
and
it
is
his
chief
delight
to
give
them
pleasure
you
must
know
that
king
frost
like
all
other
kings
has
great
treasures
of
gold
and
precious
stones
but
as
he
is
a
generous
old
monarch
he
endeavours
to
make
a
right
use
of
his
riches
so
wherever
he
goes
he
does
many
wonderful
works
he
builds
bridges
over
every
stream
as
transparent
as
glass
but
often
as
strong
as
iron
he
shakes
the
forest
trees
until
the
ripe
nuts
fall
into
the
laps
of
laughing
children
he
puts
the
flowers
to
sleep
with
one
touch
of
his
hand
then
lest
we
should
mourn
for
the
bright
faces
of
the
flowers
he
paints
the
leaves
with
gold
and
crimson
and
emerald
and
when
his
task
is
done
the
trees
are
beautiful
enough
to
comfort
us
for
the
flight
of
summer
i
will
tell
you
how
king
frost
happened
to
think
of
painting
the
leaves
for
it
is
a
strange
story
one
day
while
king
frost
was
surveying
his
vast
wealth
and
thinking
what
good
he
could
do
with
it
he
suddenly
bethought
him
of
his
jolly
old
neighbour
santa
claus
i
will
send
my
treasures
to
santa
claus
said
the
king
to
himself
he
is
the
very
man
to
dispose
of
them
satisfactorily
for
he
knows
where
the
poor
and
the
unhappy
live
and
his
kind
old
heart
is
always
full
of
benevolent
plans
for
their
relief
so
he
called
together
the
merry
little
fairies
of
his
household
and
showing
them
the
jars
and
vases
containing
his
treasures
he
bade
them
carry
them
to
the
palace
of
santa
claus
as
quickly
as
they
could
the
fairies
promised
obedience
and
were
off
in
a
twinkling
dragging
the
heavy
jars
and
vases
along
after
them
as
well
as
they
could
now
and
then
grumbling
a
little
at
having
such
a
hard
task
for
they
were
idle
fairies
and
loved
to
play
better
than
to
work
after
awhile
they
came
to
a
great
forest
and
being
tired
and
hungry
they
thought
they
would
rest
a
little
and
look
for
nuts
before
continuing
their
journey
but
thinking
their
treasure
might
be
stolen
from
them
they
hid
the
jars
among
the
thick
green
leaves
of
the
various
trees
until
they
were
sure
that
no
one
could
find
them
then
they
began
to
wander
merrily
about
searching
for
nuts
climbing
trees
peeping
curiously
into
the
empty
birds
nests
and
playing
hide
and
seek
from
behind
the
trees
now
these
naughty
fairies
were
so
busy
and
so
merry
over
their
frolic
that
they
forgot
all
about
their
errand
and
their
master
command
to
go
quickly
but
soon
they
found
to
their
dismay
why
they
had
been
bidden
to
hasten
for
although
they
had
as
they
supposed
hidden
the
treasure
carefully
yet
the
bright
eyes
of
king
sun
had
spied
out
the
jars
among
the
leaves
and
as
he
and
king
frost
could
never
agree
as
to
what
was
the
best
way
of
benefiting
the
world
he
was
very
glad
of
a
good
opportunity
of
playing
a
joke
upon
his
rather
sharp
rival
king
sun
laughed
softly
to
himself
when
the
delicate
jars
began
to
melt
and
break
at
length
every
jar
and
vase
was
cracked
or
broken
and
the
precious
stones
they
contained
were
melting
too
and
running
in
little
streams
over
the
trees
and
bushes
of
the
forest
still
the
idle
fairies
did
not
notice
what
was
happening
for
they
were
down
on
the
grass
and
the
wonderful
shower
of
treasure
was
a
long
time
in
reaching
them
but
at
last
they
plainly
heard
the
tinkling
of
many
drops
falling
like
rain
through
the
forest
and
sliding
from
leaf
to
leaf
until
they
reached
the
little
bushes
by
their
side
when
to
their
astonishment
they
discovered
that
the
were
melted
rubies
which
hardened
on
the
leaves
and
turned
them
to
crimson
and
gold
in
a
moment
then
looking
around
more
closely
they
saw
that
much
of
the
treasure
was
already
melted
for
the
oaks
and
maples
were
arrayed
in
gorgeous
dresses
of
gold
and
crimson
and
emerald
it
was
very
beautiful
but
the
disobedient
fairies
were
too
frightened
to
notice
the
beauty
of
the
trees
they
were
afraid
that
king
frost
would
come
and
punish
them
so
they
hid
themselves
among
the
bushes
and
waited
silently
for
something
to
happen
their
fears
were
well
founded
for
their
long
absence
had
alarmed
the
king
and
he
mounted
north
wind
and
went
out
in
search
of
his
tardy
couriers
of
course
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
noticed
the
brightness
of
the
leaves
and
he
quickly
guessed
the
cause
when
he
saw
the
broken
jars
from
which
the
treasure
was
still
dropping
at
first
king
frost
was
very
angry
and
the
fairies
trembled
and
crouched
lower
in
their
and
i
do
not
know
what
might
have
happened
to
them
if
just
then
a
party
of
boys
and
girls
had
not
entered
the
wood
when
the
children
saw
the
trees
all
aglow
with
brilliant
colors
they
clapped
their
hands
and
shouted
for
joy
and
immediately
began
to
pick
great
bunches
to
take
home
the
leaves
are
as
lovely
as
the
flowers
cried
they
in
their
delight
their
pleasure
banished
the
anger
from
king
frost
heart
and
the
frown
from
his
brow
and
he
too
began
to
admire
the
painted
trees
he
said
to
himself
my
treasures
are
not
wasted
if
they
make
little
children
happy
my
idle
fairies
and
my
fiery
enemy
have
taught
me
a
new
way
of
doing
good
when
the
fairies
heard
this
they
were
greatly
relieved
and
came
forth
from
their
confessed
their
fault
and
asked
their
master
forgiveness
ever
since
that
time
it
has
been
king
frost
great
delight
to
paint
the
leaves
with
the
glowing
colors
we
see
in
the
autumn
and
if
they
are
not
covered
with
gold
and
precious
stones
i
can
not
imagine
what
makes
them
so
bright
can
you
if
the
story
of
the
frost
fairies
was
read
to
helen
in
the
summer
of
she
could
not
have
understood
very
much
of
it
at
that
time
for
she
had
only
been
under
instruction
since
march
can
it
be
that
the
language
of
the
story
had
remained
dormant
in
her
mind
until
my
description
of
the
beauty
of
the
autumn
scenery
in
brought
it
vividly
before
her
mental
vision
i
have
made
careful
investigation
among
helen
friends
in
alabama
and
in
boston
and
its
vicinity
but
thus
far
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
any
later
date
when
it
could
have
been
read
to
her
another
fact
is
of
great
significance
in
this
connection
the
rose
fairies
was
published
in
the
same
volume
with
the
frost
fairies
and
therefore
was
probably
read
to
helen
at
or
about
the
same
time
now
helen
in
her
letter
of
february
quoted
above
alludes
to
this
story
of
miss
canby
as
a
dream
which
i
had
a
long
time
ago
when
i
was
a
very
little
child
surely
a
year
and
a
half
would
appear
a
long
time
ago
to
a
little
girl
like
helen
we
therefore
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
stories
must
have
been
read
to
her
at
least
as
early
as
the
summer
of
helen
keller
own
statement
the
following
entry
made
by
helen
in
her
diary
speaks
for
itself
january
this
morning
i
took
a
bath
and
when
teacher
came
upstairs
to
comb
my
hair
she
told
me
some
very
sad
news
which
made
me
unhappy
all
day
some
one
wrote
to
anagnos
that
the
story
which
i
sent
him
as
a
birthday
gift
and
which
i
wrote
myself
was
not
my
story
at
all
but
that
a
lady
had
written
it
a
long
time
ago
the
person
said
her
story
was
called
frost
fairies
i
am
sure
i
never
heard
it
it
made
us
feel
so
bad
to
think
that
people
thought
we
had
been
untrue
and
wicked
my
heart
was
full
of
tears
for
i
love
the
beautiful
truth
with
my
whole
heart
and
mind
troubles
me
greatly
now
i
do
not
know
what
i
shall
do
i
never
thought
that
people
could
make
such
mistakes
i
am
perfectly
sure
i
wrote
the
story
myself
anagnos
is
much
troubled
it
grieves
me
to
think
that
i
have
been
the
cause
of
his
unhappiness
but
of
course
i
did
not
mean
to
do
it
thought
about
my
story
in
the
autumn
because
teacher
told
me
about
the
autumn
leaves
while
we
walked
in
the
woods
at
fern
quarry
i
thought
fairies
must
have
painted
them
because
they
are
so
wonderful
and
i
thought
too
that
king
frost
must
have
jars
and
vases
containing
precious
treasures
because
i
knew
that
other
kings
long
ago
had
and
because
teacher
told
me
that
the
leaves
were
painted
ruby
emerald
gold
crimson
and
brown
so
that
i
thought
the
paint
must
be
melted
stones
i
knew
that
they
must
make
children
happy
because
they
are
so
lovely
and
it
made
me
very
happy
to
think
that
the
leaves
were
so
beautiful
and
that
the
trees
glowed
so
although
i
could
not
see
them
thought
everybody
had
the
same
thought
about
the
leaves
but
i
do
not
know
now
i
thought
very
much
about
the
sad
news
when
teacher
went
to
the
doctor
she
was
not
here
at
dinner
and
i
missed
her
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
add
anything
more
that
will
be
of
interest
my
own
heart
is
too
full
of
tears
when
i
remember
how
my
dear
little
pupil
suffered
when
she
knew
that
people
thought
we
had
been
untrue
and
wicked
for
i
know
that
she
does
indeed
love
the
beautiful
truth
with
her
whole
heart
and
mind
yours
truly
annie
sullivan
so
much
appears
in
the
volta
bureau
souvenir
the
following
letter
from
anagnos
is
reprinted
from
the
american
annals
of
the
deaf
april
perkins
institution
and
massachusetts
school
for
the
blind
so
boston
march
to
the
editor
of
the
annals
sir
in
compliance
with
your
wishes
i
make
the
following
statement
concerning
helen
keller
story
of
king
frost
it
was
sent
to
me
as
a
birthday
gift
on
november
from
tuscumbia
alabama
knowing
as
well
as
i
do
helen
extraordinary
abilities
i
did
not
hesitate
to
accept
it
as
her
own
work
nor
do
i
doubt
that
she
is
fully
capable
of
writing
such
a
composition
soon
after
its
appearance
in
print
i
was
pained
to
learn
through
the
goodson
gazette
that
a
portion
of
the
story
eight
or
nine
passages
is
either
a
reproduction
or
adaptation
of
miss
margaret
canby
frost
fairies
i
immediately
instituted
an
inquiry
to
ascertain
the
facts
in
the
case
none
of
our
teachers
or
officers
who
are
accustomed
to
converse
with
helen
ever
knew
or
heard
about
miss
canby
book
nor
did
the
child
parents
and
relatives
at
home
have
any
knowledge
of
it
her
father
captain
keller
wrote
to
me
as
follows
on
the
subject
i
hasten
to
assure
you
that
helen
could
not
have
received
any
idea
of
the
story
from
any
of
her
relations
or
friends
here
none
of
whom
can
communicate
with
her
readily
enough
to
impress
her
with
the
details
of
a
story
of
that
character
at
my
request
one
of
the
teachers
in
the
girls
department
examined
helen
in
regard
to
the
construction
of
the
story
her
testimony
is
as
follows
i
first
tried
to
ascertain
what
had
suggested
to
helen
mind
the
particular
fancies
which
made
her
story
seem
like
a
reproduction
of
one
written
by
miss
margaret
canby
helen
told
me
that
for
a
long
time
she
had
thought
of
jack
frost
as
a
king
because
of
the
many
treasures
which
he
possessed
such
rich
treasures
must
be
kept
in
a
safe
place
and
so
she
had
imagined
them
stored
in
jars
and
vases
in
one
part
of
the
royal
palace
she
said
that
one
autumn
day
her
teacher
told
her
as
they
were
walking
together
in
the
woods
about
the
many
beautiful
colours
of
the
leaves
and
she
had
thought
that
such
beauty
must
make
people
very
happy
and
very
grateful
to
king
frost
i
asked
helen
what
stories
she
had
read
about
jack
frost
in
answer
to
my
question
she
recited
a
part
of
the
poem
called
of
the
frost
and
she
referred
to
a
little
piece
about
winter
in
one
of
the
school
readers
she
could
not
remember
that
any
one
had
ever
read
to
her
any
stories
about
king
frost
but
said
she
had
talked
with
her
teacher
about
jack
frost
and
the
wonderful
things
he
did
the
only
person
that
we
supposed
might
possibly
have
read
the
story
to
helen
was
her
friend
hopkins
whom
she
was
visiting
at
the
time
in
brewster
i
asked
miss
sullivan
to
go
at
once
to
see
hopkins
and
ascertain
the
facts
in
the
matter
the
result
of
her
investigation
is
embodied
in
the
printed
note
herewith
enclosed
this
note
is
a
statement
of
the
bare
facts
and
an
apology
which
anagnos
inserted
in
his
report
of
the
perkins
institute
i
have
scarcely
any
doubt
that
miss
canby
little
book
was
read
to
helen
by
hopkins
in
the
summer
of
but
the
child
has
no
recollection
whatever
of
this
fact
on
miss
sullivan
return
to
brewster
she
read
to
helen
the
story
of
little
lord
fauntleroy
which
she
had
purchased
in
boston
for
the
purpose
the
child
was
at
once
fascinated
and
absorbed
with
the
charming
story
which
evidently
made
a
deeper
impression
upon
her
mind
than
any
previously
read
to
her
as
was
shown
in
the
frequent
reference
to
it
both
in
her
conversation
and
letters
for
many
months
afterward
her
intense
interest
in
fauntleroy
must
have
buried
all
remembrance
of
frost
fairies
and
when
more
than
three
years
later
she
had
acquired
a
fuller
knowledge
and
use
of
language
and
was
told
of
jack
frost
and
his
work
the
seed
so
long
buried
sprang
up
into
new
thoughts
and
fancies
this
may
explain
the
reason
why
helen
claims
persistently
that
the
frost
king
is
her
own
story
she
seems
to
have
some
idea
of
the
difference
between
original
composition
and
reproduction
she
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
plagiarism
until
quite
recently
when
it
was
explained
to
her
she
is
absolutely
truthful
veracity
is
the
strongest
element
of
her
character
she
was
very
much
surprised
and
grieved
when
she
was
told
that
her
composition
was
an
adaptation
of
miss
canby
story
of
frost
fairies
she
could
not
keep
back
her
tears
and
the
chief
cause
of
her
pain
seemed
to
be
the
fear
lest
people
should
doubt
her
truthfulness
she
said
with
great
intensity
of
feeling
i
love
the
beautiful
truth
a
most
rigid
examination
of
the
child
of
about
two
hours
duration
at
which
eight
persons
were
present
and
asked
all
sorts
of
questions
with
perfect
freedom
failed
to
elicit
in
the
least
any
testimony
convicting
either
her
teacher
or
any
one
else
of
the
intention
or
attempt
to
practice
deception
in
view
of
these
facts
i
can
not
but
think
that
helen
while
writing
the
frost
king
was
entirely
unconscious
of
ever
having
had
the
story
of
frost
fairies
read
to
her
and
that
her
memory
has
been
accompanied
by
such
a
loss
of
associations
that
she
herself
honestly
believed
her
composition
to
be
original
this
theory
is
shared
by
many
persons
who
are
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
child
and
who
are
able
to
rise
above
the
clouds
of
a
narrow
prejudice
very
sincerely
yours
anagnos
director
of
the
perkins
institution
and
massachusetts
school
for
the
blind
the
episode
had
a
deadening
effect
on
helen
keller
and
on
miss
sullivan
who
feared
that
she
had
allowed
the
habit
of
imitation
which
has
in
truth
made
miss
keller
a
writer
to
go
too
far
even
when
miss
keller
strikes
off
a
fine
phrase
miss
sullivan
says
in
humorous
despair
i
wonder
where
she
got
that
but
she
knows
now
since
she
has
studied
with
her
pupil
in
college
the
problems
of
composition
under
the
wise
advice
of
charles
copeland
that
the
style
of
every
writer
and
indeed
of
every
human
being
illiterate
or
cultivated
is
a
composite
reminiscence
of
all
that
he
has
read
and
heard
of
the
sources
of
his
vocabulary
he
is
for
the
most
part
as
unaware
as
he
is
of
the
moment
when
he
ate
the
food
which
makes
a
bit
of
his
thumbnail
with
most
of
us
the
contributions
from
different
sources
are
blended
crossed
and
confused
a
child
with
but
few
sources
may
keep
distinct
what
he
draws
from
each
in
this
case
helen
keller
held
almost
intact
in
her
mind
unmixed
with
other
ideas
the
words
of
a
story
which
at
the
time
it
was
read
to
her
she
did
not
fully
understand
the
importance
of
this
can
not
be
overestimated
it
shows
how
the
gathers
into
itself
words
it
has
heard
and
how
they
lurk
there
ready
to
come
out
when
the
key
that
releases
the
spring
is
touched
the
reason
that
we
do
not
observe
this
process
in
ordinary
children
is
because
we
seldom
observe
them
at
all
and
because
they
are
fed
from
so
many
sources
that
the
memories
are
confused
and
mutually
destructive
the
story
of
the
frost
king
did
not
however
come
from
helen
keller
mind
intact
but
had
taken
to
itself
the
mould
of
the
child
temperament
and
had
drawn
on
a
vocabulary
that
to
some
extent
had
been
supplied
in
other
ways
the
style
of
her
version
is
in
some
respects
even
better
than
the
style
of
miss
canby
story
it
has
the
imaginative
credulity
of
a
primitive
folktale
whereas
miss
canby
story
is
evidently
told
for
children
by
an
older
person
who
adopts
the
manner
of
a
fairy
tale
and
can
not
conceal
the
mature
mood
which
allows
such
didactic
phrases
as
jack
frost
as
he
is
sometimes
called
noon
at
which
time
sun
is
strongest
most
people
will
feel
the
superior
imaginative
quality
of
helen
keller
opening
paragraph
surely
the
writer
must
become
as
a
little
child
to
see
things
like
that
twelve
white
bears
is
a
stroke
of
genius
and
there
is
beauty
of
rhythm
throughout
the
child
narrative
it
is
original
in
the
same
way
that
a
version
of
an
old
story
is
original
this
little
story
calls
into
life
all
the
questions
of
language
and
the
philosophy
of
style
some
conclusions
may
be
briefly
suggested
all
use
of
language
is
imitative
and
one
style
is
made
up
of
all
other
styles
that
one
has
met
the
way
to
write
good
english
is
to
read
it
and
hear
it
thus
it
is
that
any
child
may
be
taught
to
use
correct
english
by
not
being
allowed
to
read
or
hear
any
other
kind
in
a
child
the
selection
of
the
better
from
the
worse
is
not
conscious
he
is
the
servant
of
his
word
experience
the
ordinary
man
will
never
be
rid
of
the
fallacy
that
words
obey
thought
that
one
thinks
first
and
phrases
afterward
there
must
first
it
is
true
be
the
intention
the
desire
to
utter
something
but
the
idea
does
not
often
become
specific
does
not
take
shape
until
it
is
phrased
certainly
an
idea
is
a
different
thing
by
virtue
of
being
phrased
words
often
make
the
thought
and
the
master
of
words
will
say
things
greater
than
are
in
him
a
remarkable
example
is
a
paragraph
from
miss
keller
sketch
in
the
youth
companion
writing
of
the
moment
when
she
learned
that
everything
has
a
name
she
says
we
met
the
nurse
carrying
my
little
cousin
and
teacher
spelled
and
for
the
first
time
i
was
impressed
with
the
smallness
and
helplessness
of
a
little
baby
and
mingled
with
the
thought
there
was
another
one
of
myself
and
i
was
glad
i
was
myself
and
not
a
baby
it
was
a
word
that
created
these
thoughts
in
her
mind
so
the
master
of
words
is
master
of
thoughts
which
the
words
create
and
says
things
greater
than
he
could
otherwise
know
helen
keller
writing
the
frost
king
was
building
better
than
she
knew
and
saying
more
than
she
meant
whoever
makes
a
sentence
of
words
utters
not
his
wisdom
but
the
wisdom
of
the
race
whose
life
is
in
the
words
though
they
have
never
been
so
grouped
before
the
man
who
can
write
stories
thinks
of
stories
to
write
the
medium
calls
forth
the
thing
it
conveys
and
the
greater
the
medium
the
deeper
the
thoughts
the
educated
man
is
the
man
whose
expression
is
educated
the
substance
of
thought
is
language
and
language
is
the
one
thing
to
teach
the
deaf
child
and
every
other
child
let
him
get
language
and
he
gets
the
very
stuff
that
language
is
made
of
the
thought
and
the
experience
of
his
race
the
language
must
be
one
used
by
a
nation
not
an
artificial
thing
volapuk
is
a
paradox
unless
one
has
french
or
english
or
german
or
some
other
language
that
has
grown
up
in
a
nation
the
deaf
child
who
has
only
the
sign
language
of
de
is
an
intellectual
philip
nolan
an
alien
from
all
races
and
his
thoughts
are
not
the
thoughts
of
an
englishman
or
a
frenchman
or
a
spaniard
the
lord
prayer
in
signs
is
not
the
lord
prayer
in
english
in
his
essay
on
style
de
quincey
says
that
the
best
english
is
to
be
found
in
the
letters
of
the
cultivated
gentlewoman
because
she
has
read
only
a
few
good
books
and
has
not
been
corrupted
by
the
style
of
newspapers
and
the
jargon
of
street
and
assembly
hall
precisely
these
outward
circumstances
account
for
helen
keller
use
of
english
in
the
early
years
of
her
education
she
had
only
good
things
to
read
some
were
indeed
trivial
and
not
excellent
in
style
but
not
one
was
positively
bad
in
manner
or
substance
this
happy
condition
has
obtained
throughout
her
life
she
has
been
nurtured
on
imaginative
literature
and
she
has
gathered
from
it
into
her
vigorous
and
tenacious
memory
the
style
of
great
writers
a
new
word
opens
its
heart
to
me
she
writes
in
a
letter
and
when
she
uses
the
word
its
heart
is
still
open
when
she
was
twelve
years
old
she
was
asked
what
book
she
would
take
on
a
long
railroad
journey
paradise
lost
she
answered
and
she
read
it
on
the
train
until
the
last
year
or
two
she
has
not
been
master
of
her
style
rather
has
her
style
been
master
of
her
it
is
only
since
she
has
made
composition
a
more
conscious
study
that
she
has
ceased
to
be
the
victim
of
the
phrase
the
lucky
victim
fortunately
of
the
good
phrase
when
in
she
was
encouraged
to
write
a
sketch
of
her
life
for
the
youth
companion
in
the
hope
that
it
would
reassure
her
and
help
her
to
recover
from
the
effect
of
the
frost
king
she
produced
a
piece
of
composition
which
is
much
more
remarkable
and
in
itself
more
entertaining
at
some
points
than
the
corresponding
part
of
her
story
in
this
book
when
she
came
to
retell
the
story
in
a
fuller
form
the
echo
was
still
in
her
mind
of
the
phrases
she
had
written
nine
years
before
yet
she
had
not
seen
her
sketch
in
the
youth
companion
since
she
wrote
it
except
two
passages
which
miss
sullivan
read
to
her
to
remind
her
of
things
she
should
say
in
this
autobiography
and
to
show
her
when
her
phrasing
troubled
her
how
much
better
she
did
as
a
little
girl
from
the
early
sketch
i
take
a
few
passages
which
seem
to
me
without
making
very
much
allowance
for
difference
in
time
almost
as
good
as
anything
she
has
written
since
i
discovered
the
true
way
to
walk
when
i
was
a
year
old
and
during
the
radiant
summer
days
that
followed
i
was
never
still
a
minute
then
when
my
father
came
in
the
evening
i
would
run
to
the
gate
to
meet
him
and
he
would
take
me
up
in
his
strong
arms
and
put
back
the
tangled
curls
from
my
face
and
kiss
me
many
times
saying
what
has
my
little
woman
been
doing
but
the
brightest
summer
has
winter
behind
it
in
the
cold
dreary
month
of
february
when
i
was
nineteen
months
old
i
had
a
serious
illness
i
still
have
confused
memories
of
that
illness
my
mother
sat
beside
my
little
bed
and
tried
to
soothe
my
feverish
moans
while
in
her
troubled
heart
she
prayed
father
in
heaven
spare
my
baby
life
but
the
fever
grew
and
flamed
in
my
eyes
and
for
several
days
my
kind
physician
thought
i
would
die
but
early
one
morning
the
fever
left
me
as
mysteriously
and
unexpectedly
as
it
had
come
and
i
fell
into
a
quiet
sleep
then
my
parents
knew
i
would
live
and
they
were
very
happy
they
did
not
know
for
some
time
after
my
recovery
that
the
cruel
fever
had
taken
my
sight
and
hearing
taken
all
the
light
and
music
and
gladness
out
of
my
little
life
but
i
was
too
young
to
realize
what
had
happened
when
i
awoke
and
found
that
all
was
dark
and
still
i
suppose
i
thought
it
was
night
and
i
must
have
wondered
why
day
was
so
long
coming
gradually
however
i
got
used
to
the
silence
and
darkness
that
surrounded
me
and
forgot
that
it
had
ever
been
day
i
forgot
everything
that
had
been
except
my
mother
tender
love
soon
even
my
childish
voice
was
stilled
because
i
had
ceased
to
hear
any
sound
but
all
was
not
lost
after
all
sight
and
hearing
are
but
two
of
the
beautiful
blessings
which
god
had
given
me
the
most
precious
the
most
wonderful
of
his
gifts
was
still
mine
my
mind
remained
clear
and
active
though
fled
the
light
as
soon
as
my
strength
returned
i
began
to
take
an
interest
in
what
the
people
around
me
were
doing
i
would
cling
to
my
mother
dress
as
she
went
about
her
household
duties
and
my
little
hands
felt
every
object
and
observed
every
motion
and
in
this
way
i
learned
a
great
many
things
when
i
was
a
little
older
i
felt
the
need
of
some
means
of
communication
with
those
around
me
and
i
began
to
make
simple
signs
which
my
parents
and
friends
readily
understood
but
it
often
happened
that
i
was
unable
to
express
my
thoughts
intelligibly
and
at
such
times
i
would
give
way
to
my
angry
feelings
utterly
teacher
had
been
with
me
nearly
two
weeks
and
i
had
learned
eighteen
or
twenty
words
before
that
thought
flashed
into
my
mind
as
the
sun
breaks
upon
the
sleeping
world
and
in
that
moment
of
illumination
the
secret
of
language
was
revealed
to
me
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
beautiful
country
i
was
about
to
explore
teacher
had
been
trying
all
the
morning
to
make
me
understand
that
the
mug
and
the
milk
in
the
mug
had
different
names
but
i
was
very
dull
and
kept
spelling
milk
for
mug
and
mug
for
milk
until
teacher
must
have
lost
all
hope
of
making
me
see
my
mistake
at
last
she
got
up
gave
me
the
mug
and
led
me
out
of
the
door
to
the
some
one
was
pumping
water
and
as
the
cool
fresh
stream
burst
forth
teacher
made
me
put
my
mug
under
the
spout
and
spelled
water
that
word
startled
my
soul
and
it
awoke
full
of
the
spirit
of
the
morning
full
of
joyous
exultant
song
until
that
day
my
mind
had
been
like
a
darkened
chamber
waiting
for
words
to
enter
and
light
the
lamp
which
is
thought
i
learned
a
great
many
words
that
day
i
do
not
remember
what
they
all
were
but
i
do
know
that
mother
father
sister
and
teacher
were
among
them
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
happier
little
child
than
i
was
that
night
as
i
lay
in
my
crib
and
thought
over
the
joy
the
day
had
brought
me
and
for
the
first
time
longed
for
a
new
day
to
come
the
next
morning
i
awoke
with
joy
in
my
heart
everything
i
touched
seemed
to
quiver
with
life
it
was
because
i
saw
everything
with
the
new
strange
beautiful
sight
which
had
been
given
me
i
was
never
angry
after
that
because
i
understood
what
my
friends
said
to
me
and
i
was
very
busy
learning
many
wonderful
things
i
was
never
still
during
the
first
glad
days
of
my
freedom
i
was
continually
spelling
and
acting
out
the
words
as
i
spelled
them
i
would
run
skip
jump
and
swing
no
matter
where
i
happened
to
be
everything
was
budding
and
blossoming
the
honeysuckle
hung
in
long
garlands
deliciously
fragrant
and
the
roses
had
never
been
so
beautiful
before
teacher
and
i
lived
from
morning
until
night
and
i
rejoiced
greatly
in
the
forgotten
light
and
sunshine
found
again
the
morning
after
our
arrival
i
awoke
bright
and
early
a
beautiful
summer
day
had
dawned
the
day
on
which
i
was
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
somber
and
mysterious
friend
i
got
up
and
dressed
quickly
and
ran
downstairs
i
met
teacher
in
the
hall
and
begged
to
be
taken
to
the
sea
at
once
not
yet
she
responded
laughing
we
must
have
breakfast
first
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
we
hurried
off
to
the
shore
our
pathway
led
through
low
sandy
hills
and
as
we
hastened
on
i
often
caught
my
feet
in
the
long
coarse
grass
and
tumbled
laughing
in
the
warm
shining
sand
the
beautiful
warm
air
was
peculiarly
fragrant
and
i
noticed
it
got
cooler
and
fresher
as
we
went
on
suddenly
we
stopped
and
i
knew
without
being
told
the
sea
was
at
my
feet
i
knew
too
it
was
immense
awful
and
for
a
moment
some
of
the
sunshine
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
the
day
but
i
do
not
think
i
was
afraid
for
later
when
i
had
put
on
my
and
the
little
waves
ran
up
on
the
beach
and
kissed
my
feet
i
shouted
for
joy
and
plunged
fearlessly
into
the
surf
but
unfortunately
i
struck
my
foot
on
a
rock
and
fell
forward
into
the
cold
water
then
a
strange
fearful
sense
of
danger
terrified
me
the
salt
water
filled
my
eyes
and
took
away
my
breath
and
a
great
wave
threw
me
up
on
the
beach
as
easily
as
if
i
had
been
a
little
pebble
for
several
days
after
that
i
was
very
timid
and
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
go
in
the
water
at
all
but
by
degrees
my
courage
returned
and
almost
before
the
summer
was
over
i
thought
it
the
greatest
fun
to
be
tossed
about
by
the
i
do
not
know
whether
the
difference
or
the
similarity
in
phrasing
between
the
child
version
and
the
woman
is
the
more
remarkable
the
early
story
is
simpler
and
shows
less
deliberate
artifice
though
even
then
miss
keller
was
prematurely
conscious
of
style
but
the
art
of
the
later
narrative
as
in
the
passage
about
the
sea
or
the
passage
on
the
medallion
of
homer
is
surely
a
fulfilment
of
the
promise
of
the
early
story
it
was
in
these
early
days
that
holmes
wrote
to
her
i
am
delighted
with
the
style
of
your
letters
there
is
no
affectation
about
them
and
as
they
come
straight
from
your
heart
so
they
go
straight
to
mine
in
the
years
when
she
was
growing
out
of
childhood
her
style
lost
its
early
simplicity
and
became
stiff
and
as
she
says
periwigged
in
these
years
the
fear
came
many
times
to
miss
sullivan
lest
the
success
of
the
child
was
to
cease
with
childhood
at
times
miss
keller
seemed
to
lack
flexibility
her
thoughts
ran
in
set
phrases
which
she
seemed
to
have
no
power
to
revise
or
turn
over
in
new
ways
then
came
the
work
in
college
original
theme
writing
with
new
ideals
of
composition
or
at
least
new
methods
of
suggesting
those
ideals
miss
keller
began
to
get
the
better
of
her
old
friendly
taskmaster
the
phrase
this
book
her
first
mature
experiment
in
writing
settles
the
question
of
her
ability
to
write
the
style
of
the
bible
is
everywhere
in
miss
keller
work
just
as
it
is
in
the
style
of
most
great
english
writers
stevenson
whom
miss
sullivan
likes
and
used
to
read
to
her
pupil
is
another
marked
influence
in
her
autobiography
are
many
quotations
chiefly
from
the
bible
and
stevenson
distinct
from
the
context
or
interwoven
with
it
the
whole
a
fabric
quite
of
her
own
design
her
vocabulary
has
all
the
phrases
that
other
people
use
and
the
explanation
of
it
and
the
reasonableness
of
it
ought
to
be
evident
by
this
time
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
strike
from
her
vocabulary
all
words
of
sound
and
vision
writing
for
other
people
she
should
in
many
cases
be
true
to
outer
fact
rather
than
to
her
own
experience
so
long
as
she
uses
words
correctly
she
should
be
granted
the
privilege
of
using
them
freely
and
not
be
expected
to
confine
herself
to
a
vocabulary
true
to
her
lack
of
sight
and
hearing
in
her
style
as
in
what
she
writes
about
we
must
concede
to
the
artist
what
we
deny
to
the
autobiographer
it
should
be
explained
too
that
look
and
see
are
used
by
the
blind
and
hear
by
the
deaf
for
perceive
they
are
simple
and
more
convenient
words
only
a
literal
person
could
think
of
holding
the
blind
to
perception
or
apperception
when
seeing
and
looking
are
so
much
easier
and
have
moreover
in
the
speech
of
all
men
the
meaning
of
intellectual
recognition
as
well
as
recognition
through
the
sense
of
sight
when
miss
keller
examines
a
statue
she
says
in
her
natural
idiom
as
her
fingers
run
over
the
marble
it
looks
like
a
head
of
flora
it
is
true
on
the
other
hand
that
in
her
descriptions
she
is
best
from
the
point
of
view
of
art
when
she
is
faithful
to
her
own
sensations
and
this
is
precisely
true
of
all
artists
her
recent
training
has
taught
her
to
drop
a
good
deal
of
her
conventionality
and
to
write
about
experiences
in
her
life
which
are
peculiar
to
her
and
which
like
the
storm
in
the
wild
cherry
tree
mean
most
and
call
for
the
truest
phrasing
she
has
learned
more
and
more
to
give
up
the
style
she
borrowed
from
books
and
tried
to
use
because
she
wanted
to
write
like
other
people
she
has
learned
that
she
is
at
her
best
when
she
feels
the
lilies
sway
lets
the
roses
press
into
her
hands
and
speaks
of
the
heat
which
to
her
means
light
miss
keller
autobiography
contains
almost
everything
that
she
ever
intended
to
publish
it
seems
worth
while
however
to
quote
from
some
of
her
chance
bits
of
writing
which
are
neither
so
informal
as
her
letters
nor
so
carefully
composed
as
her
story
of
her
life
these
extracts
are
from
her
exercises
in
her
course
in
composition
where
she
showed
herself
at
the
beginning
of
her
college
life
quite
without
rival
among
her
classmates
charles
copeland
who
has
been
for
many
years
instructor
in
english
and
lecturer
on
english
literature
at
harvard
and
radcliffe
said
to
me
in
some
of
her
work
she
has
shown
that
she
can
write
better
than
any
pupil
i
ever
had
man
or
woman
she
has
an
excellent
for
the
flow
of
sentences
the
extracts
follow
a
few
verses
of
omar
khayyam
poetry
have
just
been
read
to
me
and
i
feel
as
if
i
had
spent
the
last
in
a
magnificent
sepulcher
yes
it
is
a
tomb
in
which
hope
joy
and
the
power
of
acting
nobly
lie
buried
every
beautiful
description
every
deep
thought
glides
insensibly
into
the
same
mournful
chant
of
the
brevity
of
life
of
the
slow
decay
and
dissolution
of
all
earthly
things
the
poet
bright
fond
memories
of
love
youth
and
beauty
are
but
the
funeral
torches
shedding
their
light
on
this
tomb
or
to
modify
the
image
a
little
they
are
the
flowers
that
bloom
on
it
watered
with
tears
and
fed
by
a
bleeding
heart
beside
the
tomb
sits
a
weary
soul
rejoicing
neither
in
the
joys
of
the
past
nor
in
the
possibilities
of
the
future
but
seeking
consolation
in
forgetfulness
in
vain
the
inspiring
sea
shouts
to
this
languid
soul
in
vain
the
heavens
strive
with
its
weakness
it
still
persists
in
regretting
and
seeks
a
refuge
in
oblivion
from
the
pangs
of
present
woe
at
times
it
catches
some
faint
echo
from
the
living
joyous
real
world
a
gleam
of
the
perfection
that
is
to
be
and
thrilled
out
of
its
despondency
feels
capable
of
working
out
a
grand
ideal
even
in
the
poor
miserable
hampered
actual
wherein
it
is
placed
but
in
a
moment
the
inspiration
the
vision
is
gone
and
this
great
soul
is
again
enveloped
in
the
darkness
of
uncertainty
and
despair
it
is
wonderful
how
much
time
good
people
spend
fighting
the
devil
if
they
would
only
expend
the
same
amount
of
energy
loving
their
fellow
men
the
devil
would
die
in
his
own
tracks
of
ennui
i
often
think
that
beautiful
ideas
embarrass
most
people
as
much
as
the
company
of
great
men
they
are
regarded
generally
as
far
more
appropriate
in
books
and
in
public
discourses
than
in
the
parlor
or
at
the
table
of
course
i
do
not
refer
to
beautiful
sentiments
but
to
the
higher
truths
relating
to
everyday
life
few
people
that
i
know
seem
ever
to
pause
in
their
daily
intercourse
to
wonder
at
the
beautiful
bits
of
truth
they
have
gathered
during
their
years
of
study
often
when
i
speak
enthusiastically
of
something
in
history
or
in
poetry
i
receive
no
response
and
i
feel
that
i
must
change
the
subject
and
return
to
the
commonest
topics
such
as
the
weather
dressmaking
sports
sickness
blues
and
worries
to
be
sure
i
take
the
keenest
interest
in
everything
that
concerns
those
who
surround
me
it
is
this
very
interest
which
makes
it
so
difficult
for
me
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
some
people
who
will
not
talk
or
say
what
they
think
but
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
find
more
friends
ready
to
talk
with
me
now
and
then
about
the
wonderful
things
i
read
we
need
not
be
like
les
femmes
savantes
but
we
ought
to
have
something
to
say
about
what
we
learn
as
well
as
about
what
we
must
do
and
what
our
professors
say
or
how
they
mark
our
themes
i
took
luncheon
with
the
freshman
class
of
radcliffe
this
was
my
first
real
experience
in
college
life
and
a
delightful
experience
it
was
for
the
first
time
since
my
entrance
into
radcliffe
i
had
the
opportunity
to
make
friends
with
all
my
classmates
and
the
pleasure
of
knowing
that
they
regarded
me
as
one
of
themselves
instead
of
thinking
of
me
as
living
apart
and
taking
no
interest
in
the
everyday
nothings
of
their
life
as
i
had
sometimes
feared
they
did
i
have
often
been
surprised
to
hear
this
opinion
expressed
or
rather
implied
by
girls
of
my
own
age
and
even
by
people
advanced
in
years
once
some
one
wrote
to
me
that
in
his
mind
i
was
always
sweet
and
earnest
thinking
only
of
what
is
wise
good
and
interesting
as
if
he
thought
i
was
one
of
those
wearisome
saints
of
whom
there
are
only
too
many
in
the
world
i
always
laugh
at
these
foolish
notions
and
assure
my
friends
that
it
is
much
better
to
have
a
few
faults
and
be
cheerful
and
responsive
in
spite
of
all
deprivations
than
to
retire
into
one
shell
pet
one
affliction
clothe
it
with
sanctity
and
then
set
one
self
up
as
a
monument
of
patience
virtue
goodness
and
all
in
all
but
even
while
i
laugh
i
feel
a
twinge
of
pain
in
my
heart
because
it
seems
rather
hard
to
me
that
any
one
should
imagine
that
i
do
not
feel
the
tender
bonds
which
draw
me
to
my
young
sisters
the
sympathies
springing
from
what
we
have
in
common
youth
hope
a
attitude
towards
the
life
before
us
and
above
all
the
royalty
of
maidenhood
says
il
vient
un
age
quand
on
plus
this
is
the
only
allusion
i
have
read
to
the
possibility
that
the
sources
of
literature
varied
and
infinite
as
they
seem
now
may
sometime
be
exhausted
it
surprises
me
to
find
that
such
an
idea
has
crossed
the
mind
of
any
one
especially
of
a
highly
gifted
critic
the
very
fact
that
the
nineteenth
century
has
not
produced
many
authors
whom
the
world
may
count
among
the
greatest
of
all
time
does
not
in
my
opinion
justify
the
remark
there
may
come
a
time
when
people
cease
to
write
in
the
first
place
the
fountains
of
literature
are
fed
by
two
vast
worlds
one
of
action
one
of
thought
by
a
succession
of
creations
in
the
one
and
of
changes
in
the
other
new
experiences
and
events
call
forth
new
ideas
and
stir
men
to
ask
questions
unthought
of
before
and
seek
a
definite
answer
in
the
depths
of
human
knowledge
in
the
second
place
if
it
is
true
that
as
many
centuries
must
pass
before
the
world
becomes
perfect
as
passed
before
it
became
what
it
is
literature
will
surely
be
enriched
incalculably
by
the
tremendous
changes
acquisitions
and
improvements
that
can
not
fail
to
take
place
in
the
distant
future
if
genius
has
been
silent
for
a
century
it
has
not
been
idle
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
collecting
fresh
materials
not
only
from
the
remote
past
but
also
from
the
age
of
progress
and
development
and
perhaps
in
the
new
century
there
will
be
outbursts
of
splendor
in
all
the
various
branches
of
literature
at
present
the
world
is
undergoing
a
complete
revolution
and
in
the
midst
of
falling
systems
and
empires
conflicting
theories
and
creeds
discoveries
and
inventions
it
is
a
marvel
how
one
can
produce
any
great
literary
works
at
all
this
is
an
age
of
workers
not
of
thinkers
the
song
is
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
act
act
in
the
living
present
heart
within
and
god
overhead
a
little
later
when
the
rush
and
heat
of
achievement
relax
we
can
begin
to
expect
the
appearance
of
grand
men
to
celebrate
in
glorious
poetry
and
prose
the
deeds
and
triumphs
of
the
last
few
centuries
it
is
very
interesting
to
watch
a
plant
grow
it
is
like
taking
part
in
creation
when
all
outside
is
cold
and
white
when
the
little
children
of
the
woodland
are
gone
to
their
nurseries
in
the
warm
earth
and
the
empty
nests
on
the
bare
trees
fill
with
snow
my
glows
and
smiles
making
summer
within
while
it
is
winter
without
it
is
wonderful
to
see
flowers
bloom
in
the
midst
of
a
i
have
felt
a
bud
shyly
doff
her
green
hood
and
blossom
with
a
silken
burst
of
sound
while
the
icy
fingers
of
the
snow
beat
against
the
what
secret
power
i
wonder
caused
this
blossoming
miracle
what
mysterious
force
guided
the
seedling
from
the
dark
earth
up
to
the
light
through
leaf
and
stem
and
bud
to
glorious
fulfilment
in
the
perfect
flower
who
could
have
dreamed
that
such
beauty
lurked
in
the
dark
earth
was
latent
in
the
tiny
seed
we
planted
beautiful
flower
you
have
taught
me
to
see
a
little
way
into
the
hidden
heart
of
things
now
i
understand
that
the
darkness
everywhere
may
hold
possibilities
better
even
than
my
hopes
a
free
translation
from
horace
book
i
am
not
one
of
those
on
whom
fortune
deigns
to
smile
my
house
is
not
resplendent
with
ivory
and
gold
nor
is
it
adorned
with
marble
arches
resting
on
graceful
columns
brought
from
the
quarries
of
distant
africa
for
me
no
thrifty
spinners
weave
purple
garments
i
have
not
unexpectedly
fallen
heir
to
princely
estates
titles
or
power
but
i
have
something
more
to
be
desired
than
all
the
world
treasures
the
love
of
my
friends
and
honorable
fame
won
by
my
own
industry
and
talents
despite
my
poverty
it
is
my
privilege
to
be
the
companion
of
the
rich
and
mighty
i
am
too
grateful
for
all
these
blessings
to
wish
for
more
from
princes
or
from
the
gods
my
little
sabine
farm
is
dear
to
me
for
here
i
spend
my
happiest
days
far
from
the
noise
and
strife
of
the
world
o
ye
who
live
in
the
midst
of
luxury
who
seek
beautiful
marbles
for
new
villas
that
shall
surpass
the
old
in
splendor
you
never
dream
that
the
shadow
of
death
is
hanging
over
your
halls
forgetful
of
the
tomb
you
lay
the
foundation
of
your
palaces
in
your
mad
pursuit
of
pleasure
you
rob
the
sea
of
its
beach
and
desecrate
hallowed
ground
more
even
than
this
in
your
wickedness
you
destroy
the
peaceful
homes
of
your
clients
without
a
touch
of
remorse
you
drive
the
father
from
his
land
clasping
to
his
bosom
his
household
gods
and
his
children
you
forget
that
death
comes
to
the
rich
and
the
poor
alike
and
comes
once
for
all
but
remember
acheron
could
not
be
bribed
by
gold
to
ferry
the
crafty
prometheus
back
to
the
sunlit
world
tantalus
too
great
as
he
was
above
all
mortals
went
down
to
the
kingdom
of
the
dead
never
to
return
remember
too
that
although
death
is
inexorable
yet
he
is
just
for
he
brings
retribution
to
the
rich
for
their
wickedness
and
gives
the
poor
eternal
rest
from
their
toil
and
sorrow
ah
the
pranks
that
the
nixies
of
dreamland
play
on
us
while
we
sleep
methinks
they
are
jesters
at
the
court
of
heaven
they
frequently
take
the
shape
of
daily
themes
to
mock
me
they
strut
about
on
the
stage
of
sleep
like
foolish
virgins
only
they
carry
in
their
hands
instead
of
empty
lamps
at
other
times
they
examine
and
me
in
all
the
studies
i
have
ever
had
and
invariably
ask
me
questions
as
easy
to
answer
as
this
what
was
the
name
of
the
first
mouse
that
worried
hippopotamus
satrap
of
cambridge
under
astyagas
grandfather
of
cyrus
the
great
i
wake
with
the
words
ringing
in
my
ears
an
answer
or
your
life
such
are
the
distorted
fancies
that
flit
through
the
mind
of
one
who
is
at
college
and
lives
as
i
do
in
an
atmosphere
of
ideas
conceptions
and
which
tumble
and
jostle
each
other
until
one
is
almost
crazy
i
rarely
have
dreams
that
are
not
in
keeping
with
what
i
really
think
and
feel
but
one
night
my
very
nature
seemed
to
change
and
i
stood
in
the
eye
of
the
world
a
mighty
man
and
a
terrible
naturally
i
love
peace
and
hate
war
and
all
that
pertains
to
war
i
see
nothing
admirable
in
the
ruthless
career
of
napoleon
save
its
finish
nevertheless
in
that
dream
the
spirit
of
that
pitiless
slayer
of
men
entered
me
i
shall
never
forget
how
the
fury
of
battle
throbbed
in
my
veins
it
seemed
as
if
the
tumultuous
beating
of
my
heart
would
stop
my
breath
i
rode
a
fiery
hunter
i
can
feel
the
impatient
toss
of
his
head
now
and
the
quiver
that
ran
through
him
at
the
first
roar
of
the
cannon
from
the
top
of
the
hill
where
i
stood
i
saw
my
army
surging
over
a
sunlit
plain
like
angry
breakers
and
as
they
moved
i
saw
the
green
of
fields
like
the
cool
hollows
between
billows
trumpet
answered
trumpet
above
the
steady
beat
of
drums
and
the
rhythm
of
marching
feet
i
spurred
my
panting
steed
and
waving
my
sword
on
high
and
shouting
i
come
behold
me
warriors
europe
i
plunged
into
the
oncoming
billows
as
a
strong
swimmer
dives
into
breakers
and
struck
alas
is
true
the
bedpost
now
i
rarely
sleep
without
dreaming
but
before
miss
sullivan
came
to
me
my
dreams
were
few
and
far
between
devoid
of
thought
or
coherency
except
those
of
a
purely
physical
nature
in
my
dreams
something
was
always
falling
suddenly
and
heavily
and
at
times
my
nurse
seemed
to
punish
me
for
my
unkind
treatment
of
her
in
the
daytime
and
return
at
an
usurer
rate
of
interest
my
kickings
and
pinchings
i
would
wake
with
a
start
or
struggle
frantically
to
escape
from
my
tormentor
i
was
very
fond
of
bananas
and
one
night
i
dreamed
that
i
found
a
long
string
of
them
in
the
near
the
cupboard
all
peeled
and
deliciously
ripe
and
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
stand
under
the
string
and
eat
as
long
as
i
could
eat
after
miss
sullivan
came
to
me
the
more
i
learned
the
oftener
i
dreamed
but
with
the
waking
of
my
mind
there
came
many
dreary
fancies
and
vague
terrors
which
troubled
my
sleep
for
a
long
time
i
dreaded
the
darkness
and
loved
the
woodfire
its
warm
touch
seemed
so
like
a
human
caress
i
really
thought
it
was
a
sentient
being
capable
of
loving
and
protecting
me
one
cold
winter
night
i
was
alone
in
my
room
miss
sullivan
had
put
out
the
light
and
gone
away
thinking
i
was
sound
asleep
suddenly
i
felt
my
bed
shake
and
a
wolf
seemed
to
spring
on
me
and
snarl
in
my
face
it
was
only
a
dream
but
i
thought
it
real
and
my
heart
sank
within
me
i
dared
not
scream
and
i
dared
not
stay
in
bed
perhaps
this
was
a
confused
recollection
of
the
story
i
had
heard
not
long
before
about
red
riding
hood
at
all
events
i
slipped
down
from
the
bed
and
nestled
close
to
the
fire
which
had
not
flickered
out
the
instant
i
felt
its
warmth
i
was
reassured
and
i
sat
a
long
time
watching
it
climb
higher
and
higher
in
shining
waves
at
last
sleep
surprised
me
and
when
miss
sullivan
returned
she
found
me
wrapped
in
a
blanket
by
the
hearth
often
when
i
dream
thoughts
pass
through
my
mind
like
cowled
shadows
silent
and
remote
and
disappear
perhaps
they
are
the
ghosts
of
thoughts
that
once
inhabited
the
mind
of
an
ancestor
at
other
times
the
things
i
have
learned
and
the
things
i
have
been
taught
drop
away
as
the
lizard
sheds
its
skin
and
i
see
my
soul
as
god
sees
it
there
are
also
rare
and
beautiful
moments
when
i
see
and
hear
in
dreamland
what
if
in
my
waking
hours
a
sound
should
ring
through
the
silent
halls
of
hearing
what
if
a
ray
of
light
should
flash
through
the
darkened
chambers
of
my
soul
what
would
happen
i
ask
many
and
many
a
time
would
the
tension
of
life
snap
would
the
heart
overweighted
with
sudden
joy
stop
beating
for
very
excess
of
happiness
the
end
