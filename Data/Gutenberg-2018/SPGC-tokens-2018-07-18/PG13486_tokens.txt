biographical
introduction
by
mackail
william
morris
one
of
the
most
eminent
imaginative
writers
of
the
victorian
age
differs
from
most
other
poets
and
men
of
letters
in
two
ways
first
he
did
great
work
in
many
other
things
as
well
as
in
literature
secondly
he
had
beliefs
of
his
own
about
the
meaning
and
conduct
of
life
about
all
that
men
think
and
do
and
make
very
different
from
those
of
ordinary
people
and
he
carried
out
these
views
in
his
writings
as
well
as
in
all
the
other
work
he
did
throughout
his
life
he
was
born
in
his
father
a
member
of
a
business
firm
in
the
city
of
london
was
a
wealthy
man
and
lived
in
essex
in
a
country
house
with
large
gardens
and
fields
belonging
to
it
on
the
edge
of
epping
forest
until
the
age
of
thirteen
morris
was
at
home
among
a
large
family
of
brothers
and
sisters
he
delighted
in
the
country
life
and
especially
in
the
forest
which
is
one
of
the
most
romantic
parts
of
england
and
which
he
made
the
scene
of
many
real
and
imaginary
adventures
from
fourteen
to
eighteen
he
was
at
school
at
marlborough
among
the
wiltshire
downs
in
a
country
full
of
beauty
and
history
and
close
to
another
of
the
ancient
forests
of
england
that
of
savernake
he
proceeded
from
school
to
exeter
college
oxford
where
he
soon
formed
a
close
friendship
with
a
remarkable
set
of
young
men
of
his
own
age
chief
among
these
and
morris
closest
friend
for
the
rest
of
his
life
was
edward
the
painter
study
of
the
works
of
john
ruskin
confirmed
them
in
the
admiration
which
they
already
felt
for
the
life
and
art
of
the
middle
ages
in
the
summer
vacation
of
the
two
friends
went
to
northern
france
to
see
the
beautiful
towns
and
splendid
churches
with
which
that
country
had
been
filled
between
the
eleventh
and
the
fifteenth
centuries
and
there
they
made
up
their
minds
that
they
cared
for
art
more
than
for
anything
else
such
as
wealth
or
ease
or
the
opinion
of
the
world
and
that
as
soon
as
they
left
oxford
they
would
become
artists
by
art
they
meant
the
making
of
beauty
for
the
adornment
and
enrichment
of
human
life
and
as
artists
they
meant
to
strive
against
all
that
was
ugly
or
mean
or
untruthful
in
the
life
of
their
own
time
art
as
they
understood
it
is
one
single
thing
covering
the
whole
of
life
but
practised
in
many
special
forms
that
differ
one
from
another
among
these
many
forms
of
art
there
are
two
of
principal
importance
one
of
the
two
is
the
art
which
is
concerned
with
the
making
and
adorning
of
the
houses
in
which
men
and
women
live
that
is
to
say
architecture
with
all
its
attendant
arts
of
decoration
including
sculpture
painting
the
designing
and
ornamenting
of
metal
wood
and
glass
carpets
woven
dyed
and
embroidered
cloths
of
all
kinds
and
all
the
furniture
which
a
house
may
have
for
use
or
pleasure
the
other
is
the
art
which
is
concerned
with
the
making
and
adorning
of
stories
in
prose
and
verse
both
of
these
kinds
of
art
were
practised
by
morris
throughout
his
life
the
former
was
his
principal
occupation
he
made
his
living
by
it
and
built
up
in
it
a
business
which
alone
made
him
famous
and
which
has
had
a
great
influence
towards
bringing
more
beauty
into
daily
domestic
life
in
england
and
in
other
countries
also
his
profession
was
thus
that
of
a
manufacturer
designer
and
decorator
when
he
had
to
describe
himself
by
a
single
word
he
called
himself
a
designer
but
it
is
the
latter
branch
of
his
art
which
principally
concerns
us
now
the
art
of
a
maker
and
adorner
of
stories
he
became
famous
in
this
kind
of
art
also
both
in
prose
and
verse
as
a
and
a
poet
but
he
spoke
of
it
as
play
rather
than
work
and
although
he
spent
much
time
and
great
pains
on
it
he
regarded
it
as
relaxation
from
the
harder
and
more
constant
work
of
his
life
which
was
carrying
on
the
business
of
designing
painting
weaving
dyeing
printing
and
other
occupations
of
that
kind
in
later
life
he
also
gave
much
of
his
time
to
political
and
social
work
with
the
object
of
bringing
back
mankind
into
a
path
from
which
they
had
strayed
since
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
and
creating
a
state
of
society
in
which
art
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
a
joy
to
the
maker
and
the
user
might
be
naturally
easily
and
universally
produced
even
as
a
boy
morris
had
been
noted
for
his
love
of
reading
and
inventing
tales
but
he
did
not
begin
to
write
any
until
he
had
been
for
a
couple
of
years
at
oxford
his
earliest
poems
and
his
earliest
written
prose
tales
belong
to
the
same
year
in
which
he
determined
to
make
art
his
profession
the
first
of
either
that
he
published
appeared
in
the
oxford
and
cambridge
magazine
which
was
started
and
managed
by
him
and
his
friends
in
in
after
he
had
left
oxford
he
brought
out
a
volume
of
poems
called
after
the
title
of
the
first
poem
in
the
book
the
defence
of
guenevere
soon
afterwards
he
founded
with
some
of
his
old
oxford
friends
and
others
whom
he
had
made
in
london
among
whom
dante
gabriel
rossetti
was
the
leading
spirit
the
firm
of
morris
and
company
manufacturers
and
decorators
his
business
in
which
he
was
the
principal
and
finally
the
sole
partner
took
up
the
main
part
of
his
time
he
had
also
married
and
built
himself
a
beautiful
small
house
in
kent
the
decoration
of
which
went
busily
on
for
several
years
among
all
these
other
occupations
he
almost
gave
up
writing
stories
but
never
ceased
reading
and
thinking
about
them
in
he
came
back
to
live
in
london
where
being
close
to
his
work
he
had
more
leisure
for
other
things
and
between
and
he
wrote
between
thirty
and
forty
tales
in
verse
containing
not
less
than
seventy
or
eighty
thousand
lines
in
all
the
longest
of
these
tales
the
life
and
death
of
jason
appeared
in
it
is
the
old
greek
story
of
the
ship
argo
and
the
voyage
in
quest
of
the
golden
fleece
other
tales
are
included
in
the
earthly
paradise
published
in
three
parts
between
and
during
these
years
morris
learned
icelandic
and
his
next
published
works
were
translations
of
some
of
the
icelandic
sagas
writings
composed
from
six
to
nine
hundred
years
ago
and
containing
a
mass
of
legends
histories
and
romances
finely
told
in
a
noble
language
these
translations
were
followed
in
by
his
great
epic
poem
sigurd
the
volsung
and
the
fall
of
the
niblungs
in
that
poem
he
retold
a
story
of
which
an
icelandic
version
the
volsunga
saga
written
in
the
twelfth
century
is
one
of
the
world
masterpieces
it
is
the
great
epic
of
northern
europe
just
as
the
iliad
and
odyssey
of
homer
are
the
chief
epics
of
ancient
greece
and
the
æneid
of
virgil
the
chief
epic
of
the
roman
empire
morris
love
for
these
great
stories
of
ancient
times
led
him
to
rewrite
the
tale
of
the
volsungs
and
niblungs
which
he
reckoned
the
finest
of
them
all
more
fully
and
on
a
larger
scale
than
it
had
ever
been
written
before
he
had
already
in
translated
the
æneid
into
verse
and
some
ten
years
later
in
he
also
made
a
verse
translation
of
the
odyssey
in
he
had
also
written
another
very
beautiful
poem
love
is
enough
containing
the
story
of
three
pairs
of
lovers
a
countryman
and
an
emperor
and
empress
and
a
prince
and
peasant
girl
this
poem
was
written
in
the
form
of
a
play
not
of
a
narrative
to
write
prose
was
at
first
for
morris
more
difficult
than
to
write
poetry
verse
came
naturally
to
him
and
he
composed
in
prose
only
with
much
effort
until
after
long
practice
except
for
his
early
tales
in
the
oxford
and
cambridge
magazine
and
his
translations
of
icelandic
sagas
he
wrote
little
but
poetry
until
the
year
about
that
time
he
began
to
give
lectures
and
addresses
and
wrote
them
in
great
numbers
during
the
latter
part
of
his
life
a
number
of
them
were
collected
and
published
in
two
volumes
called
hopes
and
fears
for
art
and
signs
of
change
and
many
others
have
been
published
separately
he
thus
gradually
accustomed
himself
to
prose
composition
for
several
years
he
was
too
busy
with
other
things
which
he
thought
more
important
to
spend
time
on
storytelling
but
his
instinct
forced
itself
out
again
and
in
he
began
the
series
of
romances
in
prose
or
in
mixed
prose
and
verse
which
went
on
during
the
next
ten
years
the
chief
of
these
are
a
dream
of
john
ball
the
house
of
wolfings
the
roots
of
the
mountains
news
from
nowhere
the
glittering
plain
the
wood
beyond
the
world
the
well
at
the
world
end
the
water
of
the
wondrous
isles
and
the
sundering
flood
during
the
same
years
he
also
translated
out
of
icelandic
and
old
french
books
more
of
the
stories
which
he
had
long
known
and
admired
the
sundering
flood
was
written
in
his
last
illness
and
finished
by
him
within
a
few
days
of
his
death
in
the
autumn
of
introduction
to
sigurd
by
the
editors
the
story
of
sigurd
is
important
to
english
people
not
only
for
its
wondrous
beauty
but
also
on
account
of
its
great
age
and
of
what
it
tells
us
about
our
own
viking
ancestors
who
first
knew
the
story
the
tale
was
known
all
over
the
north
of
europe
in
denmark
in
germany
in
norway
and
sweden
and
in
iceland
hundreds
of
years
before
it
was
written
down
sometimes
different
names
were
given
to
the
characters
sometimes
the
events
of
the
story
were
slightly
altered
but
in
the
main
points
it
was
one
and
the
same
tale
if
we
look
at
a
map
of
europe
showing
the
nations
as
they
were
rather
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
we
see
the
names
of
saxons
goths
danes
and
frisians
marked
on
the
lands
around
the
baltic
sea
those
who
bore
these
names
were
the
makers
of
the
tale
of
sigurd
the
name
of
the
saxons
is
of
course
the
best
known
to
us
and
next
in
importance
come
the
people
we
call
danes
or
northmen
or
vikings
who
attacked
the
coasts
of
the
saxon
kingdoms
in
england
the
saxons
came
from
part
of
the
land
that
is
now
known
as
germany
and
the
vikings
from
denmark
and
from
scandinavia
a
third
important
tribe
was
that
of
the
goths
who
dwelt
first
in
south
sweden
and
then
in
germany
all
these
people
resembled
one
another
in
their
way
of
life
in
their
religion
and
in
their
ideas
of
what
deeds
were
good
and
what
were
evil
their
lands
were
barren
too
mountainous
or
too
cold
to
bring
forth
fruitful
crops
and
their
homes
were
not
such
as
would
tempt
men
never
to
leave
them
so
though
they
built
their
little
groups
of
wooden
houses
in
the
valleys
of
their
lands
and
made
fields
and
pastures
about
them
these
were
often
left
to
the
care
of
the
women
and
the
feeble
men
while
the
strong
men
made
raids
over
the
sea
to
other
countries
where
they
engaged
in
the
fighting
which
they
loved
and
whence
they
brought
back
plunder
to
their
homes
north
south
east
and
west
they
went
till
few
parts
of
europe
had
not
learnt
to
know
and
fear
them
their
ships
were
long
and
narrow
driven
often
by
oars
as
well
as
sails
and
outside
them
along
the
bulwarks
the
crew
hung
their
round
shields
made
of
yellow
wood
from
the
the
men
wore
byrnies
or
and
helmets
and
they
were
armed
with
swords
long
spears
or
heavy
they
were
enemies
none
could
afford
to
despise
for
they
had
great
stature
and
strength
of
body
joined
to
such
fierceness
and
delight
in
war
that
they
held
a
man
disgraced
if
he
died
peacefully
at
home
moreover
they
knew
nothing
of
mercy
to
the
conquered
courage
not
only
to
fight
but
also
to
bear
suffering
without
impatience
or
complaint
and
the
virtue
of
faithfulness
were
the
qualities
they
most
honoured
to
be
wanting
in
courage
was
disgraceful
in
their
eyes
but
it
was
equally
disgraceful
to
refuse
to
help
kinsfolk
to
lie
to
deceive
or
to
desert
a
chief
if
they
put
their
enemies
to
death
with
fearful
tortures
they
did
not
treat
them
more
severely
than
the
traitors
they
discovered
among
themselves
and
if
they
had
no
pity
for
those
they
conquered
yet
they
knew
well
how
to
admire
great
leaders
and
how
to
serve
them
faithfully
but
we
can
best
realise
their
ideas
on
these
matters
by
considering
their
religion
and
their
stories
they
worshipped
one
chief
god
odin
and
other
gods
and
goddesses
who
were
his
children
odin
was
often
called
because
he
was
the
helper
and
friend
of
human
beings
and
appeared
on
earth
in
the
form
of
an
old
man
and
seeming
ancient
with
hood
and
grey
cloak
he
had
courage
strength
and
wondrous
wisdom
for
he
knew
all
events
that
happened
in
the
world
and
he
understood
the
speech
of
birds
and
all
kinds
of
charms
and
magic
arts
men
served
him
by
brave
fighting
in
a
good
cause
and
when
they
perished
in
battle
he
received
their
souls
in
his
dwelling
of
valhalla
in
the
city
of
asgard
where
they
spent
each
day
in
warfare
and
where
at
evening
the
dead
were
revived
the
wounded
healed
and
all
feasted
together
in
odin
palace
there
they
fed
upon
the
flesh
of
the
boar
saehrimner
which
was
renewed
as
fast
as
it
was
eaten
certain
maidens
called
valkyrie
or
choosers
of
the
slain
were
odin
messengers
whom
he
sent
forth
into
the
battles
of
the
world
to
find
the
warriors
whom
he
had
appointed
to
die
and
to
bring
them
to
valhalla
in
the
story
of
sigurd
odin
has
a
very
important
part
to
play
but
for
the
understanding
of
the
tale
it
is
necessary
to
know
something
about
another
of
the
gods
this
is
loki
who
though
sprung
from
the
race
of
the
giants
yet
lived
with
the
sons
of
odin
in
asgard
behaving
sometimes
as
their
trusty
helper
but
more
often
as
their
cunning
enemy
he
caused
much
wretchedness
not
only
among
the
gods
but
on
earth
also
for
he
delighted
in
the
sight
of
misery
his
vices
were
all
those
most
hateful
to
the
norse
people
for
he
was
before
all
things
a
liar
a
deceiver
a
a
skilful
worker
of
mischief
by
guile
instead
of
by
fair
fight
there
are
many
stories
of
his
cunning
thefts
of
the
miseries
he
wrought
among
his
companions
and
of
his
envy
of
the
beloved
god
balder
whom
he
slew
by
a
trick
his
children
were
terrible
monsters
as
hated
as
himself
yet
strange
to
say
loki
was
odin
companion
in
many
of
his
adventures
the
gods
inhabited
asgard
a
city
standing
on
a
high
mountain
in
the
middle
of
the
world
odin
palace
of
valhalla
was
there
and
other
palaces
for
his
sons
and
daughters
all
round
asgard
lay
midgard
or
the
ordinary
world
of
men
and
women
its
caves
and
waste
places
were
inhabited
by
dwarfs
whom
odin
had
banished
from
the
light
of
day
for
various
ill
deeds
they
were
a
spiteful
and
cunning
race
jealous
of
mankind
and
eager
to
recover
their
lost
power
their
strength
lay
in
their
wondrous
skill
in
handicraft
for
they
could
forge
more
deadly
weapons
and
fashion
more
lovely
jewels
than
any
made
by
the
hands
of
men
but
though
possessed
of
wisdom
they
had
no
spirit
of
kindness
no
respect
for
right
and
no
dislike
of
wrong
around
midgard
lay
the
sea
and
beyond
that
utgard
a
hideous
frozen
country
inhabited
by
giants
enemies
of
the
gods
but
this
arrangement
of
the
world
was
only
for
a
season
the
gods
themselves
looked
forward
to
a
time
of
defeat
and
death
when
asgard
should
perish
in
flames
and
the
world
with
it
and
the
sun
and
moon
should
be
darkened
and
they
themselves
should
be
slain
this
great
day
was
called
ragnarok
or
sometimes
the
twilight
of
the
gods
then
loki
would
gather
giants
and
monsters
to
a
great
battle
against
the
gods
who
would
slay
their
enemies
but
who
would
themselves
fall
in
the
struggle
the
sea
would
drown
the
earth
the
stars
would
fall
and
all
things
would
pass
away
this
terrible
fate
the
gods
awaited
with
calm
and
cheerfulness
showing
even
greater
courage
than
in
their
many
deeds
of
war
they
had
to
submit
to
this
fate
for
there
were
three
beings
even
greater
than
they
these
were
the
norns
deciders
of
the
fate
of
gods
and
men
alike
they
were
three
giant
maidens
who
dwelt
by
a
sacred
fountain
and
who
controlled
the
lives
of
men
giving
to
each
sickness
and
health
success
and
failure
and
death
when
they
would
no
man
or
god
might
escape
what
the
norns
decreed
for
him
many
stories
of
these
gods
together
with
tales
of
famous
men
were
told
among
the
northern
peoples
these
stories
were
passed
on
from
one
to
another
by
word
of
mouth
till
they
grew
much
longer
and
fuller
and
the
happening
of
certain
historical
events
helped
to
take
them
from
country
to
country
as
we
have
seen
all
the
races
of
the
north
were
warlike
and
eager
for
adventure
and
so
when
trouble
came
upon
them
in
their
own
homes
they
readily
took
to
the
sea
to
plunder
the
coasts
or
to
conquer
other
lands
between
and
when
the
danes
were
invading
england
many
were
driven
from
norway
because
they
refused
to
submit
to
a
king
called
harold
fairhair
and
when
he
pursued
them
to
the
orkney
and
faroe
islands
they
took
refuge
on
the
coasts
of
iceland
there
they
settled
built
themselves
wooden
houses
planted
such
crops
as
would
grow
in
that
bleak
land
and
founded
a
commonwealth
little
by
little
they
left
the
old
viking
life
and
it
lived
only
in
their
songs
and
stories
they
had
come
to
iceland
with
a
vast
stock
of
tales
in
poetry
which
were
related
or
sung
by
professional
poets
called
skalds
at
all
kinds
of
feasts
and
gatherings
the
skalds
arranged
and
improved
the
old
stories
but
they
were
not
written
down
until
about
the
time
of
our
king
stephen
when
some
unknown
writer
collected
them
into
one
book
called
the
elder
edda
very
soon
after
this
another
book
was
written
containing
the
same
stories
in
prose
and
called
the
younger
or
prose
edda
in
this
way
many
of
the
old
poems
and
a
great
many
stories
containing
much
information
about
the
religion
which
the
people
took
with
them
to
iceland
have
been
preserved
but
it
was
from
neither
of
the
eddas
that
william
morris
took
his
story
of
sigurd
all
through
the
period
from
till
about
the
time
of
henry
iii
of
england
the
skalds
had
been
many
of
the
poetic
stories
in
prose
and
as
the
people
grew
more
civilised
one
tale
after
another
was
written
down
in
its
new
form
these
prose
tales
were
called
sagas
and
among
the
very
greatest
is
the
volsunga
saga
or
story
of
sigurd
it
is
a
tale
which
has
been
told
in
other
lands
besides
iceland
we
read
part
of
the
same
story
in
the
old
english
poem
of
beowulf
and
in
germany
it
was
made
into
a
great
poem
called
the
nibelungenlied
the
german
musician
richard
wagner
set
it
to
music
in
a
famous
series
of
operas
called
the
nibelungen
ring
but
his
tale
differs
in
many
points
from
that
contained
in
morris
poem
for
morris
chose
the
old
saga
as
it
was
written
in
iceland
not
the
german
story
on
this
he
founded
his
poem
adding
much
beautiful
description
and
greatly
lengthening
the
whole
the
story
deals
first
with
a
certain
king
volsung
to
whose
son
sigmund
odin
presented
a
magic
sword
but
siggeir
the
jealous
king
of
the
goths
slew
volsung
and
took
sigmund
prisoner
that
he
might
have
the
sword
for
himself
only
after
many
toils
and
perils
did
sigmund
win
it
back
and
reign
in
his
father
kingdom
at
last
in
his
old
age
he
fell
in
battle
and
the
sword
of
odin
was
shattered
but
his
wife
queen
hiordis
kept
the
fragments
for
the
son
who
was
born
to
her
soon
after
in
denmark
whither
she
fled
for
safety
this
son
of
sigmund
and
hiordis
was
sigurd
the
volsung
he
was
brought
up
in
denmark
and
grew
strong
and
beautiful
brave
kind
of
heart
and
utterly
truthful
in
word
and
deed
when
he
became
a
man
he
longed
to
win
fame
and
kingship
by
mighty
deeds
and
when
his
tutor
told
him
of
a
great
dragon
that
guarded
a
hoard
of
gold
in
the
mountains
he
resolved
to
kill
it
so
the
fragments
of
odin
sword
were
forged
into
a
new
blade
and
sigurd
slew
the
dragon
and
took
the
gold
but
with
it
he
brought
on
himself
a
curse
which
had
been
put
upon
the
treasure
by
the
dwarf
from
whom
it
had
been
stolen
sigurd
then
found
and
wakened
brynhild
a
maiden
who
lay
in
an
enchanted
sleep
upon
a
high
mountain
they
loved
one
another
and
sigurd
gave
her
a
ring
from
the
dragon
treasure
promising
to
return
and
marry
her
then
the
curse
led
him
to
join
with
the
fierce
and
treacherous
niblungs
or
cloudy
people
their
king
and
his
mother
grew
jealous
when
they
saw
sigurd
more
mighty
and
more
beloved
than
themselves
and
by
enchantments
they
caused
him
to
forget
brynhild
to
wed
the
princess
gudrun
and
at
last
to
aid
the
niblung
king
gunnar
to
win
brynhild
for
his
own
wife
then
the
curse
of
the
gold
brought
death
to
many
for
sigurd
and
brynhild
discovered
all
the
treachery
of
the
niblungs
who
in
their
anger
slew
sigurd
and
brynhild
killed
herself
that
she
might
not
live
and
sorrow
for
him
such
is
the
story
of
sigurd
as
it
was
told
a
thousand
years
ago
in
distant
iceland
and
as
it
is
retold
in
this
poem
by
william
morris
the
story
of
sigurd
the
volsung
book
sigmund
the
dwelling
of
king
volsung
and
the
wedding
of
signy
his
there
was
a
dwelling
of
kings
ere
the
world
was
waxen
old
dukes
were
the
there
and
the
roofs
were
thatched
with
gold
earls
were
the
wrights
that
wrought
it
and
silver
nailed
its
doors
earls
wives
were
the
queens
daughters
strewed
its
floors
and
the
masters
of
its
were
the
mightiest
men
that
cast
the
sails
of
the
storm
of
battle
adown
the
bickering
blast
there
dwelt
men
and
in
hope
exceeding
great
met
the
good
days
and
the
evil
as
they
went
the
way
of
fate
there
the
gods
were
unforgotten
yea
whiles
they
walked
with
men
though
in
that
world
beginning
rose
a
murmur
now
and
again
of
the
midward
time
and
the
fading
and
the
last
of
the
latter
days
and
the
entering
in
of
the
terror
and
the
death
of
the
people
praise
thus
was
the
dwelling
of
volsung
the
king
of
the
midworld
mark
as
a
rose
in
the
winter
season
a
candle
in
the
dark
and
as
in
all
other
matters
was
all
earthly
houses
crown
and
the
least
of
its
shields
was
a
renown
so
therein
withal
was
a
marvel
and
a
glorious
thing
to
see
for
amidst
of
its
midmost
sprang
up
a
mighty
tree
that
reared
its
blessings
roofward
and
wreathed
the
dear
with
the
glory
of
the
summer
and
the
garland
of
the
year
i
know
not
how
they
called
it
ere
volsung
changed
his
life
but
his
dawning
of
fair
promise
and
his
noontide
of
the
strife
his
eve
of
the
and
the
garnering
of
his
fame
have
bred
us
many
a
story
and
named
us
many
a
name
and
when
men
tell
of
volsung
they
call
that
tree
that
crowned
stem
the
branstock
and
so
was
it
told
unto
me
so
there
was
the
throne
of
volsung
beneath
its
blossoming
bower
but
high
the
red
it
rose
tower
and
tower
and
therein
were
the
wild
hawks
dwelling
abiding
the
dole
of
their
lord
and
they
wailed
high
over
the
wine
and
laughed
to
the
waking
sword
still
were
its
boughs
but
for
them
when
lo
on
an
even
of
may
comes
a
man
from
siggeir
the
king
with
a
word
for
his
mouth
to
say
all
hail
to
thee
king
volsung
from
the
king
of
the
goths
i
come
he
hath
heard
of
thy
sword
victorious
and
thine
abundant
home
he
hath
heard
of
thy
sons
in
the
battle
the
fillers
of
odin
hall
and
a
word
hath
the
blown
him
full
fruitful
be
its
fall
a
word
of
thy
daughter
signy
the
crown
of
womanhood
now
he
deems
thy
friendship
goodly
and
thine
help
in
the
battle
good
and
for
these
will
he
give
his
friendship
and
his
again
but
if
thou
wouldst
grant
his
asking
and
make
his
heart
full
fain
then
shalt
thou
give
him
a
matter
saith
he
without
a
price
signy
the
fairer
than
fair
signy
the
wiser
than
wise
now
the
message
gladdened
volsung
and
his
sons
but
no
word
spake
signy
till
the
king
asked
her
what
her
mind
might
be
then
said
signy
i
will
wed
the
goth
king
and
yet
shall
i
rue
my
lot
in
his
hall
and
volsung
urged
her
with
kind
words
to
do
nought
against
her
will
but
her
mind
was
fixed
and
she
said
she
wrought
but
what
the
gods
had
so
the
earl
of
siggeir
went
his
way
with
gifts
and
fair
words
bidding
the
goth
king
come
ere
a
month
was
over
to
wed
the
signy
and
bear
her
home
so
on
even
ere
the
undark
night
began
siggeir
the
king
of
the
went
up
from
the
bath
of
the
swan
unto
the
volsung
dwelling
with
many
an
earl
about
there
through
the
glimmering
thicket
the
linked
mail
rang
out
and
sang
as
mid
the
woodways
sings
the
ford
there
were
and
many
a
sword
and
many
a
kirtle
and
many
a
written
spear
so
came
they
to
the
acres
and
drew
the
threshold
near
and
amidst
of
the
garden
blossoms
on
the
grassy
land
was
volsung
the
king
of
the
with
his
sons
on
either
hand
therewith
down
lighted
siggeir
the
lord
of
a
mighty
folk
yet
showed
he
by
king
volsung
as
the
bramble
by
the
oak
nor
reached
his
helm
to
the
shoulder
of
the
least
of
volsung
sons
and
so
into
the
hall
they
wended
the
kings
and
their
mighty
ones
and
they
dight
the
feast
full
glorious
and
drank
through
the
death
of
the
day
till
the
shadowless
moon
rose
upward
till
it
wended
white
away
then
they
went
to
the
beds
and
at
last
for
an
hour
or
twain
were
all
things
still
and
silent
save
a
flaw
of
the
summer
rain
but
on
the
morrow
noontide
when
the
sun
was
high
and
bare
more
glorious
was
the
banquet
and
now
was
signy
there
and
she
sat
beside
king
siggeir
a
glorious
bride
forsooth
ruddy
and
white
was
she
wrought
as
the
tooth
but
she
neither
laughed
nor
spake
and
her
eyes
were
hard
and
cold
and
with
wandering
looks
her
lord
would
she
behold
that
saw
sigmund
her
brother
the
eldest
volsung
son
and
oft
he
looked
upon
her
and
their
eyes
met
now
and
anon
and
ruth
arose
in
his
heart
and
hate
of
siggeir
the
goth
and
there
had
he
broken
the
wedding
but
for
plighted
promise
and
troth
but
those
twain
were
beheld
of
siggeir
and
he
deemed
of
the
volsung
kin
that
amid
their
might
and
their
malice
small
honour
should
he
win
yet
thereof
made
he
no
semblance
but
abided
times
to
be
and
laughed
out
with
the
loudest
amid
the
hope
and
the
glee
and
nought
of
all
saw
volsung
as
he
dreamed
of
the
coming
glory
and
how
the
kings
of
his
kindred
should
fashion
the
round
world
story
so
round
about
the
branstock
they
feast
in
the
gleam
of
the
gold
and
though
the
deeds
of
were
not
yet
waxen
old
yet
had
they
tales
for
songcraft
and
the
blossomed
garth
of
rhyme
tales
of
the
framing
of
all
things
and
the
entering
in
of
time
from
the
halls
of
the
outer
heaven
so
near
they
knew
the
door
wherefore
uprose
a
and
his
hands
that
loved
the
oar
now
dealt
with
the
rippling
and
he
sang
of
the
shaping
of
earth
and
how
the
stars
were
lighted
and
where
the
winds
had
birth
and
the
gleam
of
the
first
of
summers
on
the
yet
untrodden
grass
but
as
men
hearts
were
hearkening
some
heard
the
thunder
pass
the
cloudless
noontide
heaven
and
some
men
turned
about
and
deemed
that
in
the
doorway
they
heard
a
man
laugh
out
then
into
the
volsung
dwelling
a
mighty
man
there
strode
and
seeming
ancient
yet
bright
his
visage
glowed
was
the
hood
upon
him
and
his
kirtle
as
the
latter
morning
sundog
when
the
storm
is
on
the
way
a
bill
he
bore
on
his
shoulder
whose
mighty
ashen
beam
burnt
bright
with
the
flame
of
the
sea
and
the
blended
silver
gleam
and
such
was
the
guise
of
his
raiment
as
the
volsung
elders
had
told
was
borne
by
their
fathers
fathers
and
the
first
that
warred
in
the
wold
so
strode
he
to
the
branstock
nor
greeted
any
lord
but
forth
from
his
cloudy
raiment
he
drew
a
gleaming
sword
and
smote
it
deep
in
the
and
the
wild
hawks
overhead
laughed
the
naked
heaven
as
at
last
he
spake
and
said
earls
of
the
goths
and
volsungs
abiders
on
the
earth
lo
there
amid
the
branstock
a
blade
of
plenteous
worth
the
folk
of
the
forgers
wrought
never
better
steel
since
first
the
burg
of
heaven
uprose
for
weal
now
let
the
man
among
you
whose
heart
and
hand
may
shift
to
pluck
it
from
the
oakwood
take
it
for
my
gift
then
but
his
own
heart
falter
its
point
and
edge
shall
fail
until
the
night
beginning
and
the
ending
of
the
tale
be
merry
earls
of
the
o
volsung
sons
be
wise
and
reap
the
that
ripening
for
you
lies
for
they
told
me
in
the
wild
wood
i
heard
on
the
mountain
side
that
the
shining
house
of
heaven
is
wrought
exceeding
wide
and
that
there
the
shall
have
abundant
rest
while
earth
grows
scant
of
great
ones
and
fadeth
from
its
best
and
fadeth
from
its
midward
and
groweth
poor
and
vile
all
hail
to
thee
king
volsung
farewell
for
a
little
while
so
sweet
his
speaking
sounded
so
wise
his
words
did
seem
that
moveless
all
men
sat
there
as
in
a
happy
dream
we
stir
not
lest
we
waken
but
there
his
speech
had
end
and
slowly
down
the
and
outward
did
he
wend
and
none
would
cast
him
a
question
or
follow
on
his
ways
for
they
knew
that
the
gift
was
odin
a
sword
for
the
world
to
praise
but
now
spake
volsung
the
king
why
sit
ye
silent
and
still
is
the
visage
a
token
of
terror
and
ill
arise
o
volsung
children
earls
of
the
goths
arise
and
set
your
hands
to
the
hilts
as
mighty
men
and
wise
yet
deem
it
not
too
easy
for
belike
a
fateful
blade
lies
there
in
the
heart
of
the
branstock
for
a
fated
warrior
made
now
therewith
spake
king
siggeir
king
volsung
give
me
a
grace
to
try
it
the
first
of
all
men
lest
another
win
my
place
and
mere
steal
my
glory
and
the
gain
that
i
might
win
then
somewhat
laughed
king
volsung
and
he
said
o
guest
begin
though
herein
is
the
first
as
the
last
for
the
gods
have
long
to
live
nor
hath
odin
yet
forgotten
unto
whom
the
gift
he
would
give
then
forth
to
the
tree
went
siggeir
the
mighty
lord
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
gemstones
and
strained
at
the
glorious
sword
till
his
heart
grew
black
with
anger
and
never
a
word
he
said
as
he
wended
back
to
the
but
signy
waxed
when
he
sat
him
adown
beside
her
and
her
heart
was
nigh
to
break
for
the
shame
and
the
fateful
boding
and
therewith
king
volsung
spake
thus
comes
back
the
mightiest
king
of
earth
and
how
shall
the
feeble
venture
yet
each
man
knows
his
worth
and
today
may
a
great
beginning
from
a
little
seed
upspring
to
many
a
great
one
that
hath
the
name
of
king
so
stand
forth
free
and
unfree
stand
forth
both
most
and
least
but
first
ye
earls
of
the
ye
lovely
lords
we
feast
upstood
the
earls
of
siggeir
and
each
man
drew
anigh
and
deemed
his
time
was
coming
for
a
glorious
gain
and
high
but
for
all
their
mighty
shaping
and
their
deeds
in
the
no
looser
in
the
branstock
that
gift
of
odin
stood
then
uprose
volsung
homemen
and
the
folk
and
the
shepherds
came
gathering
round
the
oak
and
the
searchers
of
the
thicket
and
the
dealers
with
the
oar
and
the
least
and
the
worst
of
them
all
was
a
mighty
man
of
war
but
for
all
their
mighty
shaping
and
the
struggle
and
the
strain
of
their
hands
the
deft
in
labour
they
tugged
thereat
in
vain
and
still
as
the
shouting
and
jeers
and
the
names
of
men
and
the
laughter
beat
backward
from
gable
to
gable
and
rattled
and
rafter
moody
and
still
sat
siggeir
for
he
said
they
have
trained
me
here
as
a
mock
for
their
woodland
bondsmen
and
yet
shall
they
buy
it
dear
now
the
tumult
sank
a
little
and
men
cried
on
volsung
the
king
and
his
sons
the
hedge
of
battle
to
try
the
fateful
thing
so
volsung
laughed
and
answered
i
will
set
me
to
the
toil
lest
these
my
guests
of
the
should
deem
i
fear
the
foil
yet
nought
am
i
and
the
oldest
friend
is
best
and
this
my
hand
first
fellow
will
i
bear
to
the
rest
nor
wield
meanwhile
another
yea
this
shall
i
have
in
hand
when
mid
the
host
of
odin
in
the
day
of
doom
i
stand
therewith
from
his
belt
of
battle
he
raised
the
golden
sheath
and
showed
the
glittering
about
the
hidden
death
then
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
branstock
and
cried
o
tree
beloved
i
thank
thee
of
thy
that
so
little
thou
art
moved
abide
thou
thus
green
bower
when
i
am
dead
and
gone
and
the
best
of
all
my
kindred
a
better
day
hath
won
then
as
a
young
man
laughed
he
and
on
the
hilts
of
gold
his
hand
the
took
fast
and
certain
hold
and
long
he
drew
and
strained
him
but
mended
not
the
tale
yet
none
the
more
thereover
his
mirth
of
heart
did
fail
but
he
wended
to
the
and
thence
began
to
cry
sons
i
have
gotten
and
cherished
now
stand
ye
forth
to
try
lest
odin
tell
in
how
from
the
way
he
strayed
and
how
to
the
man
he
would
not
he
gave
away
his
blade
so
therewithal
rose
rerir
and
wasted
might
and
main
then
gunthiof
and
then
hunthiof
they
wearied
them
in
vain
nought
was
the
might
of
agnar
nought
helgi
could
avail
sigi
the
tall
and
solar
no
further
brought
the
tale
nor
geirmund
the
priest
of
the
temple
nor
gylfi
of
the
wood
at
last
by
the
side
of
the
branstock
sigmund
the
volsung
stood
and
with
right
hand
wise
in
battle
the
precious
caught
yet
in
a
careless
fashion
as
he
deemed
it
all
for
nought
when
lo
from
floor
to
rafter
went
up
a
shattering
shout
for
aloft
in
the
hand
of
sigmund
the
naked
blade
shone
out
as
high
his
head
he
shook
it
for
the
sword
had
come
away
from
the
grip
of
the
heart
of
the
branstock
as
though
all
loose
it
lay
a
little
while
he
stood
there
mid
the
glory
of
the
hall
like
the
best
of
the
trees
of
the
garden
when
the
april
sunbeams
fall
on
its
blossomed
boughs
in
the
morning
and
tell
of
the
days
to
be
then
back
unto
the
he
wended
soberly
for
this
was
the
thought
within
him
belike
the
day
shall
come
when
i
shall
bide
here
lonely
amid
the
volsung
home
its
glory
and
sole
avenger
its
seed
yea
i
am
the
hired
of
odin
his
workday
will
to
speed
and
the
shall
be
what
then
were
it
come
and
past
and
i
laid
by
the
last
of
the
sheaves
with
my
wages
earned
at
the
last
he
lifted
his
eyes
as
he
thought
it
for
now
was
he
come
to
his
place
and
there
he
stood
by
his
father
and
met
siggeir
face
to
face
and
he
saw
him
blithe
and
smiling
and
heard
him
how
he
spake
o
best
of
the
sons
of
volsung
i
am
merry
for
thy
sake
and
the
glory
that
thou
hast
gained
us
but
whereas
thine
hand
and
heart
are
now
the
lords
of
the
battle
how
thou
for
thy
part
a
matter
to
better
the
best
wilt
thou
overgild
fine
gold
or
dye
the
red
rose
redder
so
i
prithee
let
me
hold
this
sword
that
comes
to
thine
hand
on
the
day
i
wed
thy
kin
for
at
home
have
i
a
there
is
therein
the
weight
of
a
harness
there
is
silver
plenteous
store
there
is
iron
and
amber
that
the
southern
men
love
sore
when
they
sell
me
the
woven
wonder
the
purple
born
of
the
sea
and
it
hangeth
up
in
that
bower
and
all
this
is
a
gift
for
thee
but
the
sword
that
came
to
my
wedding
methinketh
it
meet
and
right
that
it
lie
on
my
knees
in
the
council
and
stead
me
in
the
fight
but
sigmund
laughed
and
answered
and
he
spake
a
scornful
word
and
if
i
take
twice
that
treasure
will
it
buy
me
odin
sword
and
the
gift
that
the
gods
have
given
will
it
buy
me
again
to
stand
betwixt
two
mightiest
with
a
thing
in
mine
hand
that
all
their
might
hath
missed
of
when
the
men
come
buying
thine
iron
and
amber
dost
thou
sell
thine
honour
then
do
they
wrap
it
in
bast
of
the
linden
or
run
it
in
moulds
of
earth
and
shalt
thou
account
mine
honour
as
a
matter
of
lesser
worth
came
the
sword
to
thy
wedding
to
thine
hand
it
never
came
and
thence
is
thine
envy
whetted
to
deal
me
this
word
of
shame
black
then
was
the
heart
of
siggeir
but
his
face
grew
pale
and
red
till
he
drew
a
smile
thereover
and
spake
the
word
and
said
nay
pardon
me
signy
kinsman
when
the
heart
desires
it
teacheth
the
tongue
ill
speaking
and
my
word
belike
was
such
but
the
honour
of
thee
and
thy
kindred
i
hold
it
even
as
mine
and
i
love
you
as
my
and
take
ye
this
for
a
sign
i
bid
thee
now
king
volsung
and
these
thy
glorious
sons
and
thine
earls
and
thy
dukes
of
battle
and
all
thy
mighty
ones
to
come
to
the
house
of
the
as
honoured
guests
and
dear
and
abide
the
winter
over
that
the
dusky
days
and
drear
may
be
glorious
with
thy
presence
that
all
folk
may
praise
my
life
and
the
friends
that
my
fame
hath
gotten
and
that
this
my
wife
thine
eyes
may
make
the
merrier
till
she
bear
my
eldest
born
then
speedily
answered
volsung
no
king
of
the
earth
might
scorn
such
noble
bidding
siggeir
and
surely
will
i
come
to
look
upon
thy
glory
and
the
goths
abundant
home
but
let
two
months
wear
over
for
i
have
many
a
thing
to
shape
and
shear
in
the
woodland
as
befits
a
people
king
and
thou
meanwhile
here
abiding
of
all
my
goods
shalt
be
free
and
then
shall
we
twain
together
roof
over
the
sea
with
the
sides
of
our
golden
dragons
and
our
blended
shields
shall
fright
the
and
the
folk
of
the
fishy
fields
answered
the
siggeir
i
thank
thee
well
for
this
and
thy
bidding
is
most
kingly
yet
take
it
not
amiss
that
i
wend
my
ways
in
the
morning
for
we
know
indeed
that
the
sea
is
a
foe
full
deadly
and
a
friend
that
fails
at
need
and
for
all
the
words
of
volsung
so
must
the
matter
be
and
siggeir
the
goth
and
signy
on
the
morn
shall
sail
the
sea
then
the
feast
sped
on
the
fairer
far
into
the
night
but
amidst
the
mirth
sigmund
and
signy
were
sad
at
heart
and
before
the
sun
was
risen
next
day
signy
came
to
her
father
in
secret
and
begged
him
to
stay
in
his
own
country
rather
than
trust
the
guileful
heart
and
hand
of
siggeir
but
volsung
answered
that
he
must
go
to
be
siggeir
guest
for
he
could
not
break
his
pledged
word
through
fear
of
peril
so
on
the
morrow
the
siggeir
departed
with
signy
and
when
two
months
were
passed
volsung
made
ready
to
visit
them
the
volsungs
fared
to
the
land
of
the
goths
and
of
the
fall
of
king
so
now
when
all
things
were
ready
in
the
first
of
the
autumn
tide
adown
unto
the
the
volsung
children
ride
and
lightly
go
a
shipboard
a
goodly
company
though
the
tale
thereof
be
scanty
and
their
ships
no
more
than
three
but
kings
sons
dealt
with
the
and
earls
and
dukes
of
war
were
the
halers
of
the
hawsers
and
the
tuggers
at
the
oar
but
when
the
sun
on
the
morrow
shone
over
earth
and
sea
ashore
went
the
volsung
children
a
goodly
company
and
toward
king
siggeir
dwelling
heath
and
holt
they
went
but
when
they
came
to
the
topmost
of
a
certain
grassy
bent
lo
there
lay
the
land
before
them
as
thick
with
shield
and
spear
as
the
rich
man
wealthiest
acre
with
the
harvest
of
the
year
there
bade
king
volsung
tarry
and
dight
the
for
duly
he
said
doeth
siggeir
to
meet
his
guests
by
the
way
so
shield
by
shield
they
serried
nor
ever
hath
been
told
of
any
host
of
battle
more
glorious
with
the
gold
and
there
stood
the
high
king
volsung
in
the
very
front
of
war
and
lovelier
was
his
visage
than
ever
heretofore
as
he
rent
apart
the
that
his
brand
of
battle
bound
and
the
bright
blade
gleamed
to
the
heavens
and
he
cast
the
sheath
to
the
ground
then
up
the
steep
came
the
and
the
drew
anigh
and
earth
face
shook
beneath
them
yet
cried
they
never
a
cry
and
the
volsungs
stood
all
silent
although
forsooth
at
whiles
the
faces
grown
would
play
the
flickering
smiles
and
swords
would
clink
and
rattle
not
long
had
they
to
bide
for
soon
that
flood
of
murder
flowed
round
the
then
at
last
the
edges
mingled
and
if
men
forbore
the
shout
yet
the
din
of
steel
and
iron
in
the
grey
clouds
rang
about
but
how
to
tell
of
king
volsung
and
the
valour
of
his
folk
three
times
the
wood
of
battle
before
their
edges
broke
and
the
sorely
dwindled
and
reft
of
the
ruddy
gold
against
the
drift
of
the
for
the
fourth
time
yet
did
hold
but
men
shields
were
waxen
heavy
with
the
weight
of
shafts
they
bore
and
the
fifth
time
many
a
champion
cast
earthward
odin
door
and
gripped
the
sword
and
in
sheaves
the
spears
came
on
and
at
last
the
host
of
the
within
the
won
and
wild
was
the
work
within
it
and
oft
and
again
forth
brake
the
sons
of
volsung
and
drave
the
foe
in
vain
for
the
driven
throng
still
thickened
till
it
might
not
give
aback
but
fast
abode
king
volsung
amid
the
shifting
wrack
in
the
place
where
once
was
the
forefront
for
he
said
my
feet
are
old
and
if
i
wend
on
further
there
is
nought
more
to
behold
than
this
that
i
see
about
me
whiles
drew
his
foes
away
and
stared
across
the
corpses
that
before
his
lay
but
nought
he
followed
after
then
needs
must
they
in
front
thrust
on
by
the
thickening
come
up
to
bear
the
brunt
till
all
his
limbs
were
weary
and
his
body
rent
and
torn
then
he
cried
lo
now
allfather
is
not
the
swathe
well
shorn
wouldst
thou
have
me
toil
for
ever
nor
win
the
wages
due
and
mid
the
hedge
of
foemen
his
blunted
sword
he
threw
and
laid
like
the
oars
of
a
longship
the
level
pressed
on
the
unshielded
elder
and
clashed
amidst
his
breast
and
dead
he
fell
thrust
backward
and
rang
on
the
dead
men
gear
but
still
for
a
certain
season
durst
no
man
draw
anear
for
was
as
a
great
god
slaying
and
they
feared
the
wrath
of
the
sky
and
they
deemed
their
hearts
might
harden
if
awhile
they
should
let
him
lie
the
ending
of
all
volsung
sons
save
sigmund
only
and
of
how
he
abideth
in
the
wild
they
joined
battle
again
but
the
fight
grew
feeble
after
volsung
fell
and
his
earls
were
struck
down
one
by
one
last
of
all
his
sons
were
borne
to
earth
and
carried
captive
to
the
hall
where
siggeir
awaited
them
for
he
himself
had
feared
to
face
the
volsung
swords
then
he
would
have
slain
them
at
once
without
torture
but
signy
besought
him
that
they
might
breathe
the
earthly
air
a
day
or
two
before
their
death
and
he
listened
to
her
for
he
saw
how
he
might
thus
give
them
greater
pain
he
bade
his
men
lead
them
to
a
glade
in
the
forest
and
fetter
them
to
the
mightiest
tree
that
grew
there
so
the
ten
volsungs
were
fettered
with
iron
to
a
great
oak
and
on
the
morrow
siggeir
woodmen
told
him
sweet
tidings
for
beasts
of
the
wood
had
devoured
two
and
left
their
bones
in
the
fetters
so
it
befell
every
night
till
the
woodmen
brought
word
that
nothing
remained
of
the
king
foemen
save
their
bones
in
the
fetters
that
had
bound
them
now
a
watch
had
been
set
on
signy
lest
she
should
send
help
to
her
brethren
but
henceforth
no
man
hindered
her
from
going
out
to
the
wood
so
that
night
she
came
to
the
glade
in
the
forest
and
saw
in
the
midst
of
it
a
mighty
man
who
was
toiling
to
dig
a
grave
in
the
greensward
and
behold
it
was
sigmund
the
volsung
but
she
cried
and
had
no
fear
if
thou
art
living
sigmund
what
day
work
dost
thou
here
in
the
midnight
and
the
forest
but
if
thou
art
nought
but
a
ghost
then
where
are
those
volsung
brethren
of
whom
thou
wert
best
and
most
then
he
turned
about
unto
her
and
his
raiment
was
fouled
and
torn
and
his
eyen
were
great
and
hollow
as
a
famished
man
forlorn
but
he
cried
hail
sister
signy
i
looked
for
thee
before
though
what
should
a
woman
compass
she
one
alone
and
no
more
when
all
we
shielded
volsungs
did
nought
in
siggeir
land
o
yea
i
am
living
indeed
and
this
labour
of
mine
hand
is
to
bury
the
bones
of
the
volsungs
and
lo
it
is
done
so
draw
near
volsung
daughter
and
pile
we
many
a
stone
where
lie
the
grey
wolf
gleanings
of
what
was
once
so
good
so
she
set
her
hand
to
the
labour
and
they
toiled
they
twain
in
the
wood
and
when
the
work
was
over
dead
night
was
beginning
to
fall
then
spake
the
signy
now
shall
thou
tell
the
tale
of
the
death
of
the
volsung
brethren
ere
the
wood
thy
wrath
shall
hide
ere
i
wend
me
back
in
the
dwelling
of
kings
to
abide
then
said
sigmund
we
lay
fettered
to
the
tree
and
at
midnight
there
came
from
the
thicket
two
mighty
and
falling
on
my
brethren
gylfi
and
geirmund
they
devoured
them
in
their
bonds
and
turned
again
to
the
forest
night
after
night
my
sister
this
befell
till
i
was
left
alone
with
our
brother
sigi
to
await
the
then
came
midnight
and
one
of
the
wolves
fell
upon
sigi
and
the
other
turned
on
me
but
i
met
it
with
snarling
like
its
own
and
my
teeth
gripped
its
throat
and
my
hands
strove
with
the
fetters
till
they
burst
so
i
slew
the
beast
with
my
irons
but
when
i
looked
sigi
lay
dead
and
the
other
wolf
had
fled
again
to
the
thicket
then
i
lay
hid
till
siggeir
woodmen
had
looked
on
the
place
and
departed
with
their
tidings
and
as
i
beheld
them
i
knew
that
pity
was
killed
in
my
heart
and
that
henceforward
i
should
live
but
to
avenge
me
on
him
who
hath
so
set
the
gods
at
nought
then
signy
spake
noble
words
of
comfort
saying
i
wot
well
that
siggeir
shall
pay
the
due
price
of
his
deeds
though
the
vengeance
may
tarry
long
and
i
wot
also
that
thy
life
shall
yet
know
gladness
bear
a
stout
heart
therefore
to
meet
the
waiting
time
and
make
thee
a
lair
in
the
woods
whence
thou
mayest
fall
on
men
of
the
and
win
what
thy
life
needeth
as
for
me
i
will
see
thy
face
once
again
ere
many
days
are
past
to
wot
where
thou
dwellest
and
then
must
we
meet
no
more
and
so
saying
she
kissed
him
and
departed
but
sigmund
turned
in
the
and
sought
a
as
she
had
bidden
him
the
fostering
of
sinfiotli
signy
son
and
of
the
slaying
of
siggeir
the
so
wrought
is
the
will
of
king
siggeir
and
he
weareth
odin
sword
and
it
lies
on
his
knees
in
the
council
and
hath
no
other
lord
and
he
sendeth
earls
the
to
take
king
volsung
land
and
those
scattered
and
shepherdless
sheep
must
come
beneath
his
hand
and
he
holdeth
the
signy
as
his
handmaid
and
his
wife
and
nought
but
his
will
she
doeth
nor
raiseth
a
word
of
strife
so
his
heart
is
praising
his
wisdom
and
he
deems
him
of
most
avail
of
all
the
lords
of
the
cunning
that
teacheth
how
to
prevail
now
sigmund
dwelt
long
in
the
abiding
in
a
strong
cave
deep
hidden
in
a
thicket
by
the
and
now
and
again
he
fell
upon
the
folk
of
siggeir
as
they
journeyed
and
slew
them
and
thus
he
had
and
gold
as
much
as
he
would
also
he
became
a
master
of
masters
in
the
smithying
craft
and
the
folk
who
beheld
the
gleam
of
his
forge
by
night
deemed
that
a
king
of
the
giants
was
awakened
from
death
to
dwell
there
and
they
durst
not
wander
near
the
cavern
so
passed
the
years
till
on
a
springtide
morning
signy
sent
forth
to
sigmund
a
damsel
leading
her
eldest
son
a
child
of
ten
summers
and
bearing
a
word
of
her
mouth
to
bid
him
foster
the
child
for
his
helper
if
he
should
prove
worthy
and
and
sigmund
heeded
her
words
and
fostered
the
child
for
the
space
of
three
months
even
though
he
could
give
no
love
to
a
son
of
siggeir
at
last
he
was
minded
to
try
the
boy
courage
to
which
end
he
set
a
deadly
adder
in
the
and
bade
the
child
bake
bread
but
he
feared
when
he
found
something
that
moved
in
the
meal
and
had
not
courage
to
do
the
task
then
would
sigmund
foster
him
no
longer
but
thrust
him
out
from
the
woods
to
return
to
his
father
hall
so
ten
years
won
over
again
and
signy
sent
another
son
to
the
and
the
lad
was
called
sinfiotli
sigmund
thrust
him
into
many
dangers
and
burdened
him
with
heavy
loads
and
he
bore
all
passing
well
now
after
a
year
sigmund
deemed
that
the
time
for
his
testing
was
come
and
once
again
he
set
an
adder
in
the
and
bade
the
lad
bake
bread
and
the
boy
feared
not
the
worm
but
kneaded
it
with
the
dough
and
baked
all
together
so
sigmund
cherished
him
as
his
own
son
and
he
grew
strong
and
valiant
and
loved
sigmund
as
his
father
now
sigmund
began
to
ponder
how
he
might
at
last
take
vengeance
on
siggeir
and
gladly
did
sinfiotli
hear
him
for
all
his
love
was
given
to
sigmund
so
that
he
no
longer
deemed
himself
the
son
at
last
when
the
long
mirk
nights
of
winter
were
come
sigmund
and
his
went
their
way
to
the
home
of
siggeir
and
sought
to
lurk
therein
then
sinfiotli
led
the
way
to
a
storehouse
where
lay
great
and
whence
they
could
see
the
lighted
and
hear
the
clamour
of
siggeir
folk
there
they
had
to
abide
the
time
when
the
feasters
should
be
hushed
in
sleep
long
seemed
the
hours
to
sinfiotli
but
sigmund
was
calm
and
then
it
befell
that
two
of
queen
signy
children
threw
a
golden
toy
hither
and
thither
in
the
and
at
last
it
rolled
away
among
the
till
it
lay
at
sigmund
feet
so
the
children
followed
it
and
coming
face
to
face
with
those
lurkers
they
fled
back
to
the
and
sigmund
and
his
saw
all
hope
was
ended
for
they
heard
the
rising
tumult
as
men
ran
to
their
weapons
so
they
made
ready
to
go
forth
and
die
in
the
hall
then
on
came
the
battle
around
the
twain
and
but
short
is
the
tale
to
tell
for
sinfiotli
slipped
on
the
floor
and
the
shield
wall
encompassed
sigmund
and
so
they
were
both
hoppled
strait
and
fast
the
washed
their
hall
of
blood
and
got
them
to
slumber
but
siggeir
lay
long
pondering
what
dire
death
he
might
bring
on
his
foes
now
at
the
first
grey
dawning
siggeir
folk
dight
a
pit
and
it
had
two
chambers
with
a
sundering
stone
in
the
midst
then
they
brought
the
volsung
kindred
and
set
them
therein
one
in
each
chamber
that
they
might
abide
death
alone
and
yet
in
hearing
of
one
another
woe
and
over
the
top
the
thralls
laid
roofing
turfs
but
so
lingering
were
their
hands
that
eve
drew
on
ere
the
task
was
finished
then
stole
signy
forth
in
the
dusk
and
spake
the
thralls
fair
and
gave
them
gold
that
they
might
hold
their
peace
of
what
she
did
and
when
they
gainsaid
her
nought
she
drew
out
something
wrapped
in
wheat
straw
and
cast
it
down
swiftly
into
the
pit
where
sinfiotli
lay
and
departed
sinfiotli
at
first
deemed
it
food
but
after
a
space
sigmund
heard
him
laugh
aloud
for
joy
for
within
the
wrappings
lay
the
sword
of
the
branstock
and
sinfiotli
cried
out
the
joyous
tidings
to
his
and
tarried
not
to
set
the
point
to
the
stone
that
sundered
them
and
lo
the
blade
pierced
through
and
sigmund
grasped
the
point
then
sawed
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
together
till
they
cleft
the
stone
and
they
hewed
full
hard
at
the
roofing
till
they
cast
the
turfs
aside
and
their
hearts
were
gladdened
with
the
sight
of
the
starry
heaven
forth
they
leapt
and
no
words
were
needed
of
whither
they
should
wend
but
they
fell
on
king
siggeir
and
slew
them
sleeping
and
made
haste
to
find
the
store
of
winter
faggots
wherewith
they
built
a
mighty
bale
about
the
hall
of
siggeir
they
set
a
torch
to
the
bale
and
sigmund
gat
him
to
one
hall
door
and
sinfiotli
to
the
other
and
now
the
awoke
to
their
last
of
days
then
cried
siggeir
to
his
thralls
and
offered
them
joyous
and
plenteous
wealth
if
they
would
give
him
life
deeming
that
they
had
fired
the
hall
in
hatred
but
there
came
a
great
voice
crying
from
the
door
nay
no
toilers
are
we
wealth
is
ours
when
we
list
but
now
our
hearts
are
set
to
avenge
our
kin
now
hath
the
murder
seed
sprung
and
borne
its
fruit
now
the
and
buried
work
this
deed
now
doom
draweth
nigh
thee
at
the
hand
of
sigmund
the
volsung
and
sinfiotli
signy
son
then
the
voice
cried
again
come
ye
forth
women
of
the
goths
and
thou
o
signy
my
sister
come
forth
to
seek
the
boughs
of
the
branstock
so
fled
the
women
from
the
fire
and
passed
scatheless
by
sinfiotli
blade
but
signy
came
not
at
all
then
the
earls
of
siggeir
strove
to
burst
from
the
hall
but
ever
the
two
glaives
at
the
doorways
drove
them
back
to
the
fire
and
lo
now
came
signy
in
queenly
raiment
and
stood
before
sinfiotli
and
said
o
mightiest
son
this
is
the
hour
of
our
parting
and
fain
am
i
of
slumber
and
the
end
of
my
toil
now
i
have
seen
this
day
and
the
blither
do
i
leave
thee
because
thy
days
on
earth
shall
be
but
few
i
charge
thee
make
thy
life
glorious
and
leave
a
goodly
tale
she
kissed
him
and
turned
to
sigmund
and
her
face
in
the
seemed
to
him
fair
and
ruddy
as
in
the
days
when
they
twain
dwelt
by
the
branstock
and
she
said
my
youth
was
happy
yet
this
hour
is
the
crown
of
my
which
draw
nigh
their
ending
and
now
i
charge
thee
sigmund
when
thou
sittest
once
more
a
mighty
king
beneath
the
boughs
of
the
branstock
that
thou
remember
how
i
loved
the
volsung
name
and
spared
not
to
spend
all
that
was
mine
for
its
blossoming
then
she
kissed
him
and
turned
again
and
the
dawn
brightened
at
her
back
and
the
fire
shone
red
before
her
and
so
for
the
last
time
was
signy
beheld
by
the
eyes
of
men
thereafter
king
siggeir
bowed
earthward
and
the
mighty
walls
crashed
down
and
so
that
dark
lay
wasted
and
its
glory
was
swept
away
sigmund
cometh
to
the
land
of
the
volsungs
again
and
of
the
death
of
sinfiotli
his
now
sigmund
the
king
bestirs
him
and
sinfiotli
sigmund
son
and
they
gather
a
host
together
and
many
a
mighty
one
then
they
set
the
ships
in
the
and
sail
from
the
stranger
shore
and
the
beaks
of
the
golden
dragons
see
the
volsungs
land
once
more
and
men
hearts
are
fulfilled
of
joyance
and
they
cry
the
sun
shines
now
with
never
a
curse
to
hide
it
and
they
shall
reap
that
sow
then
for
many
a
day
sits
sigmund
the
boughs
of
the
branstock
green
with
his
earls
and
lords
about
him
as
the
volsung
wont
hath
been
and
oft
he
thinketh
on
signy
and
oft
he
nameth
her
name
and
tells
how
she
spent
her
joyance
and
her
and
her
fame
that
the
volsung
kin
might
blossom
and
bear
the
fruit
of
worth
for
the
hope
of
unborn
people
and
the
harvest
of
the
earth
and
again
he
thinks
of
the
word
that
he
spake
that
other
day
how
he
should
abide
there
lonely
when
his
kin
was
passed
away
their
glory
and
sole
avenger
their
seed
but
far
and
wide
went
sinfiotli
through
the
earth
mowing
the
war
swathe
and
wasting
the
land
and
passing
but
little
time
in
song
and
laughter
in
his
father
hall
so
went
his
days
in
warfare
and
valour
and
yet
his
end
was
not
glorious
for
he
drank
of
the
poisoned
cup
given
him
by
the
sister
of
a
warrior
he
had
rightly
slain
none
might
come
nigh
sigmund
in
his
anguish
as
he
lifted
the
head
of
his
fallen
and
then
swiftly
bare
him
from
the
hall
on
he
went
through
dark
thicket
and
over
heath
past
the
and
the
homes
of
the
deer
till
he
came
to
a
great
rushing
water
whereon
was
a
boat
manned
by
a
mighty
man
and
seeming
ancient
this
mighty
one
told
sigmund
he
had
been
bidden
to
waft
a
great
king
over
the
water
and
bade
him
lay
his
burden
on
board
but
when
sigmund
would
have
followed
he
could
see
neither
ship
nor
man
but
sigmund
went
back
to
his
throne
and
behaved
himself
as
a
king
listening
to
his
people
plaints
and
dealing
out
justice
the
last
battle
of
king
sigmund
and
the
death
of
now
there
was
a
king
of
the
islands
whom
the
tale
doth
eylimi
call
and
saith
he
was
wise
and
valiant
though
his
kingdom
were
but
small
he
had
one
only
daughter
that
hiordis
had
to
name
a
woman
wise
and
shapely
beyond
the
praise
of
fame
and
now
saith
the
son
of
king
volsung
that
his
time
is
short
enow
to
labour
the
volsung
garden
and
the
hand
must
be
set
to
the
plough
so
he
sendeth
an
earl
of
the
people
to
king
eylimi
hall
bearing
the
gifts
and
the
tokens
and
this
word
in
his
mouth
withal
king
sigmund
the
son
of
volsung
hath
sent
me
here
with
a
word
that
plenteous
good
of
thy
daughter
among
all
folk
he
hath
heard
and
he
wooeth
that
wisest
of
women
that
she
may
sit
on
his
throne
now
hereof
would
he
have
an
answer
within
a
space
and
these
gifts
meanwhile
he
giveth
for
the
increase
of
thy
grace
so
king
eylimi
hearkened
the
message
and
hath
no
word
to
say
for
an
earl
of
king
lyngi
the
mighty
is
come
that
very
day
he
too
for
the
wooing
of
hiordis
and
lyngi
realm
is
at
hand
but
afar
king
sigmund
abideth
many
a
sea
and
land
and
the
man
is
young
and
eager
and
grim
and
guileful
of
mood
at
last
he
sayeth
abide
here
such
space
as
thou
deemest
good
but
tomorn
shalt
thou
have
thine
answer
that
thine
heart
may
the
lighter
be
for
the
hearkening
of
harp
and
songcraft
and
the
dealing
with
game
and
glee
then
he
went
to
queen
hiordis
bower
where
she
worked
in
the
silk
and
the
gold
the
deeds
of
the
world
that
should
be
and
the
deeds
that
were
of
old
and
he
stood
before
her
and
said
often
have
i
told
thee
that
thou
shouldst
wed
only
the
man
thou
wouldst
now
it
hath
come
to
pass
that
two
kings
desire
thee
and
she
swiftly
rose
to
her
feet
as
she
said
and
which
be
they
he
spake
the
first
is
lyngi
a
valiant
man
and
a
fair
a
neighbour
ill
for
thy
father
if
a
foe
name
he
must
bear
and
the
next
is
king
sigmund
the
volsung
of
a
land
far
over
sea
and
well
thou
knowest
his
kindred
and
his
might
and
his
valiancy
and
the
tales
of
his
heart
of
a
god
and
though
old
he
be
waxen
now
yet
men
deem
that
the
wide
world
blossom
from
sigmund
loins
shall
grow
said
hiordis
i
wot
my
father
that
hereof
may
strife
arise
yet
soon
spoken
is
mine
answer
for
i
who
am
called
the
wise
shall
i
thrust
by
the
praise
of
the
people
and
the
tale
that
no
ending
hath
and
the
love
and
the
heart
of
the
godlike
and
the
path
for
the
rose
and
the
stem
of
the
lily
and
the
kiss
and
the
eyes
desire
that
passeth
and
the
frail
unstable
bliss
now
shalt
thou
tell
king
sigmund
that
i
deem
it
the
crown
of
my
life
to
dwell
in
the
house
of
his
fathers
amidst
all
peace
and
strife
now
the
king
heart
sore
misgave
him
but
herewith
must
he
be
content
and
great
gifts
to
the
earl
of
lyngi
and
a
word
withal
he
sent
that
the
woman
troth
was
plighted
to
another
people
king
but
king
sigmund
earl
on
the
morrow
hath
joyful
and
ere
two
moons
be
perished
he
shall
fetch
his
bride
away
and
bid
him
king
eylimi
sayeth
to
come
with
no
small
array
but
with
sword
and
shield
and
lest
aught
of
ill
betide
so
forth
goes
the
earl
of
sigmund
across
the
wide
and
comes
to
the
land
of
the
volsungs
and
meeteth
sigmund
the
king
and
tells
how
he
sped
on
his
errand
and
the
joyful
so
king
sigmund
maketh
him
ready
and
they
ride
adown
to
the
sea
all
glorious
of
gear
and
raiment
and
a
goodly
company
yet
hath
sigmund
thought
of
his
father
and
the
deed
he
wrought
before
and
hath
scorn
to
gather
his
people
and
all
his
hosts
of
war
to
wend
to
the
feast
and
the
wedding
yet
are
their
ten
and
the
shielded
folk
aboard
them
are
the
mightiest
men
of
men
so
sigmund
goeth
a
shipboard
and
they
hoist
their
sails
to
the
wind
and
the
beaks
of
the
golden
dragons
leave
the
volsungs
land
behind
then
come
they
to
eylimi
kingdom
and
good
welcome
have
they
there
and
when
sigmund
looked
on
hiordis
he
deemed
her
wise
and
fair
but
her
heart
was
exceeding
fain
when
she
saw
the
glorious
king
and
it
told
her
of
times
that
should
be
full
many
a
noble
thing
so
there
is
sigmund
wedded
at
a
great
and
goodly
feast
and
day
by
day
on
hiordis
the
joy
of
her
heart
increased
and
her
father
joyed
in
sigmund
and
his
might
and
majesty
and
dead
in
the
heart
of
the
his
ancient
fear
did
lie
yet
forsooth
had
men
looked
seaward
they
had
seen
the
gathering
cloud
and
the
little
wind
arising
that
should
one
day
pipe
so
loud
for
well
may
ye
wot
indeed
that
king
lyngi
the
mighty
is
wroth
when
he
getteth
the
gifts
and
the
answer
and
that
tale
of
the
troth
and
he
saith
he
will
have
the
gifts
and
the
woman
herself
withal
either
for
loving
or
hating
and
that
both
those
heads
shall
fall
so
now
when
sigmund
and
hiordis
are
wedded
a
month
or
more
and
the
volsung
bids
men
dight
them
to
cross
the
lo
how
there
cometh
the
tidings
of
measureless
mighty
hosts
who
are
gotten
ashore
from
their
on
the
skirts
of
king
coasts
sore
boded
the
heart
of
the
of
what
the
end
should
be
but
sigmund
long
beheld
him
and
he
said
thou
of
me
that
my
coming
hath
brought
thee
evil
but
put
aside
such
things
for
long
have
i
lived
and
i
know
it
that
the
lives
of
mighty
kings
are
not
cast
away
nor
drifted
like
the
down
before
the
wind
and
surely
i
know
who
say
it
that
never
would
hiordis
mind
have
been
turned
to
wed
king
lyngi
or
aught
but
the
volsung
seed
come
go
we
forth
to
the
battle
that
shall
be
the
latest
deed
of
thee
and
me
meseemeth
yea
whether
thou
live
or
die
no
more
shall
the
brand
of
odin
at
peace
in
his
scabbard
lie
and
therewith
he
brake
the
and
drew
the
blade
of
bale
and
death
on
the
point
abided
fear
sat
on
the
edges
pale
so
men
ride
adown
to
the
and
the
kings
their
hosts
array
when
the
high
noon
flooded
heaven
and
the
men
of
the
volsungs
lay
with
king
eylimi
shielded
champions
mid
lyngi
hosts
of
war
as
the
brown
pips
lie
in
the
apple
when
ye
cut
it
through
the
core
but
now
when
the
kings
were
departed
from
the
king
house
hiordis
went
and
before
men
joined
the
battle
she
came
to
a
woody
bent
where
she
lay
with
one
of
her
maidens
the
death
and
the
deeds
to
behold
in
the
noon
sun
shone
king
sigmund
as
an
image
all
of
gold
and
he
stood
before
the
foremost
and
the
banner
of
his
fame
and
many
a
thing
he
remembered
and
he
called
on
each
earl
by
his
name
to
do
well
for
the
house
of
the
volsungs
and
the
ages
yet
unborn
then
he
tossed
up
the
sword
of
the
branstock
and
blew
on
his
father
horn
dread
of
so
many
a
battle
of
so
many
a
man
then
all
the
earth
seemed
moving
as
the
hosts
of
lyngi
ran
on
the
volsung
men
and
the
like
wolves
upon
the
prey
but
sore
was
their
labour
and
toil
ere
the
end
of
their
harvesting
day
on
went
the
volsung
banners
and
on
went
sigmund
before
and
his
sword
was
the
flail
of
the
tiller
on
the
wheat
of
the
floor
and
his
shield
was
rent
from
his
arm
and
his
helm
was
sheared
from
his
head
but
who
may
draw
nigh
him
to
smite
for
the
heap
and
the
rampart
of
dead
white
went
his
hair
on
the
wind
like
the
ragged
drift
of
the
cloud
and
his
harness
was
the
angry
shroud
when
the
summer
sun
is
departing
in
the
first
of
the
night
of
wrack
and
his
sword
was
the
cleaving
lightning
that
smites
and
is
hurried
aback
ere
the
hand
may
rise
against
it
and
his
voice
was
the
following
thunder
then
cold
grew
the
battle
before
him
with
the
fear
and
the
wonder
for
again
in
his
ancient
eyes
the
light
of
victory
gleamed
from
his
mouth
grown
tuneful
and
sweet
the
song
of
his
kindred
streamed
and
no
more
was
he
worn
and
weary
and
no
more
his
life
seemed
spent
and
with
all
the
hope
of
his
childhood
was
his
wrath
of
battle
blent
and
he
thought
a
little
further
and
the
river
of
strife
is
passed
and
i
shall
sit
triumphant
the
king
of
the
world
at
last
but
lo
through
the
hedge
of
the
a
mighty
man
there
came
and
seeming
ancient
but
his
visage
shone
like
flame
was
his
kirtle
and
his
hood
was
cloudy
blue
and
he
bore
a
mighty
as
he
waded
the
through
and
stood
face
to
face
with
sigmund
and
upheaved
the
bill
to
smite
once
more
round
the
head
of
the
volsung
fierce
glittered
the
light
the
sword
that
came
from
odin
and
sigmund
cry
once
more
rang
out
to
the
very
heavens
above
the
din
of
war
then
clashed
the
meeting
edges
with
sigmund
latest
stroke
and
in
shivering
shards
fell
earthward
that
fear
of
worldly
folk
but
changed
were
the
eyes
of
sigmund
and
the
left
his
face
for
that
mighty
helper
was
gone
and
in
his
place
drave
on
the
unbroken
the
volsung
empty
hands
and
there
they
smote
down
sigmund
the
wonder
of
all
lands
on
the
foemen
on
the
his
deeds
had
piled
that
day
ill
hour
for
sigmund
fellows
they
fall
like
the
seeded
hay
before
the
brown
scythes
sweeping
and
there
the
fell
in
the
of
his
battle
wherein
he
wrought
right
well
and
soon
they
were
nought
but
foemen
who
stand
upon
their
feet
on
the
by
the
ocean
where
the
grass
and
the
meet
and
now
hath
the
conquering
another
deed
to
do
and
he
saith
who
now
gainsayeth
king
lyngi
come
to
woo
the
lord
and
the
overcomer
and
the
bane
of
the
volsung
kin
so
he
fares
to
the
dwelling
a
wife
of
the
kings
to
win
and
the
host
is
gathered
together
and
they
leave
the
field
of
the
dead
and
round
as
a
targe
of
the
the
moon
ariseth
red
and
so
when
the
last
is
departed
and
she
deems
they
will
come
not
aback
fares
hiordis
forth
from
the
thicket
to
the
field
of
the
fateful
wrack
and
was
her
heart
for
sorrow
as
she
waded
the
swathes
of
the
sword
not
far
did
she
search
the
ere
she
found
her
king
and
lord
on
the
heap
that
his
glaive
had
fashioned
not
yet
was
his
spirit
past
though
his
hurts
were
many
and
grievous
and
his
ebbing
fast
and
glad
were
his
eyes
and
open
as
her
wan
face
over
him
hung
and
he
spake
thou
art
sick
with
sorrow
and
i
would
thou
wert
not
so
young
yet
as
my
days
passed
shall
thine
pass
and
a
short
while
now
it
seems
since
my
hand
first
gripped
the
and
my
glory
was
but
in
dreams
she
said
thou
livest
thou
livest
the
leeches
shall
heal
thee
still
nay
said
he
my
heart
hath
hearkened
to
odin
bidding
and
will
for
today
have
mine
eyes
beheld
him
nay
he
needed
not
to
speak
forsooth
i
knew
of
his
message
and
the
thing
he
came
to
seek
and
now
do
i
live
but
to
tell
thee
of
the
days
that
are
yet
to
come
and
perchance
to
solace
thy
sorrow
and
then
will
i
get
me
home
to
my
kin
that
are
gone
before
me
lo
yonder
where
i
stood
the
shards
of
a
glaive
of
battle
that
was
once
the
best
of
the
good
take
them
and
keep
them
surely
i
have
lived
no
empty
days
the
norns
were
my
nursing
mothers
i
have
won
the
people
praise
when
the
gods
for
one
deed
asked
me
i
ever
gave
them
twain
spendthrift
of
glory
i
was
and
great
was
my
gain
now
these
shards
have
been
my
fellow
in
the
work
the
gods
would
have
but
today
hath
odin
taken
the
gift
that
once
he
gave
i
have
wrought
for
the
volsungs
truly
and
yet
have
i
known
full
well
that
a
better
one
than
i
am
shall
bear
the
tale
to
tell
and
for
him
shall
these
shards
be
smithied
and
he
shall
be
my
son
to
remember
what
i
have
forgotten
and
to
do
what
i
left
undone
then
failed
the
voice
of
sigmund
but
so
mighty
was
the
man
that
a
long
while
yet
he
lingered
till
the
dusky
night
grew
wan
and
she
sat
and
sorrowed
him
but
no
more
a
word
he
spake
then
a
long
way
over
the
the
day
began
to
break
and
when
the
sun
was
arisen
a
little
he
turned
his
head
till
the
low
beams
bathed
his
eyen
and
there
lay
sigmund
dead
and
the
sun
rose
up
on
the
earth
but
where
was
the
volsung
kin
and
the
folk
that
the
gods
had
begotten
the
praise
of
all
people
to
win
king
sigmund
the
volsung
was
laid
in
mound
on
the
of
the
now
hiordis
looked
from
the
dead
and
her
eyes
strayed
down
to
the
sea
and
a
shielded
ship
she
saw
and
a
company
who
beached
the
ship
for
the
landing
so
swift
she
fled
away
and
once
more
to
the
depth
of
the
thicket
wherein
her
handmaid
lay
and
she
said
i
have
left
my
lord
and
my
lord
is
dead
and
gone
and
he
gave
me
a
charge
full
heavy
and
here
are
we
twain
alone
and
earls
from
the
sea
are
landing
give
me
thy
blue
attire
and
take
my
purple
and
gold
and
my
crown
of
the
fire
and
be
thou
the
wife
of
king
volsung
when
men
of
our
names
shall
ask
and
i
will
be
the
handmaid
now
i
bid
thee
to
this
task
and
i
pray
thee
not
to
fail
me
because
of
thy
faith
and
truth
and
because
i
have
ever
loved
thee
and
thy
mother
fostered
my
youth
so
the
other
nought
gainsaith
it
and
they
shift
their
raiment
there
but
was
the
maiden
and
a
woman
tall
and
fair
now
the
lord
of
those
men
was
a
king
and
the
son
of
a
king
king
elf
the
son
of
the
helper
and
he
sailed
from
warfaring
and
drew
anigh
to
the
and
sailed
along
the
strand
for
the
shipmen
needed
water
and
fain
would
go
and
king
elf
stood
hard
by
the
tiller
while
the
world
was
yet
then
the
red
sun
lit
the
dawning
and
they
looked
and
lo
behold
the
wrack
of
a
mighty
battle
and
heaps
of
the
shielded
dead
and
a
woman
alive
amidst
them
a
queen
with
crowned
head
and
her
eyes
strayed
down
to
the
and
she
saw
that
weaponed
folk
and
turned
and
fled
to
the
thicket
then
the
lord
of
the
shipmen
spoke
lo
here
shall
we
lack
for
water
for
the
brooks
with
blood
shall
run
yet
wend
we
ashore
to
behold
it
and
to
wot
of
the
deeds
late
done
so
they
turned
their
faces
to
sigmund
and
waded
the
swathes
of
the
sword
o
look
ye
long
said
the
for
here
lieth
a
mighty
lord
and
all
these
are
the
deeds
of
his
yet
hardy
hearts
be
sure
that
they
once
durst
look
in
his
face
or
the
wrath
of
his
eyen
endure
though
his
lips
be
glad
and
smiling
as
a
god
that
dreameth
of
mirth
would
god
i
were
one
of
his
kindred
for
none
such
are
left
upon
earth
now
fare
we
into
the
thicket
for
thereto
is
the
woman
fled
and
belike
she
shall
tell
us
the
story
of
this
field
of
the
mighty
dead
so
they
wend
and
find
the
women
and
bespeak
them
kind
and
fair
then
spake
the
handmaid
of
the
house
we
were
and
i
am
the
queen
called
hiordis
and
the
man
that
lies
on
the
field
was
mine
own
lord
sigmund
the
volsung
the
mightiest
under
shield
then
all
amazed
were
the
when
they
hearkened
to
that
word
and
great
and
heavy
tidings
they
deem
their
ears
have
heard
but
again
spake
out
the
and
this
one
beside
so
pale
and
as
tall
as
a
goddess
and
white
and
lovely
eyed
in
sooth
and
in
troth
said
the
woman
my
is
this
she
hath
wept
long
over
the
battle
and
sore
afraid
she
is
now
the
king
looks
hard
upon
her
but
he
saith
no
word
thereto
and
down
again
to
the
with
the
they
go
there
they
set
their
hands
to
the
labour
and
amidst
the
deadly
mead
they
raise
a
mound
for
sigmund
a
mighty
house
indeed
and
therein
they
set
that
and
goodly
was
his
throne
and
dight
with
gold
and
scarlet
and
the
walls
of
the
house
were
done
with
the
cloven
shields
of
the
foemen
and
banners
borne
to
field
but
none
might
find
his
or
the
splinters
of
his
shield
and
clenched
and
fast
was
his
right
hand
but
no
sword
therein
he
had
for
hiordis
spake
to
the
shipmen
our
lord
and
master
bade
that
the
shards
of
his
glaive
of
battle
should
go
with
our
lady
the
queen
and
by
them
that
lie
a
many
things
are
seen
queen
hiordis
is
known
and
how
she
abideth
in
the
house
of
elf
the
son
of
the
then
elf
asked
of
the
two
women
where
they
would
go
and
they
prayed
that
he
would
take
them
to
his
land
where
they
dwelt
for
long
in
all
honour
but
the
old
queen
the
mother
of
elf
was
indeed
a
woman
wise
above
many
and
fain
would
she
know
why
the
less
noble
of
the
two
was
dressed
the
more
richly
and
why
the
handmaid
gave
always
wiser
counsel
than
her
mistress
so
she
bade
her
son
to
speak
suddenly
and
to
take
them
unawares
then
he
asked
the
one
how
she
knew
in
the
dark
winter
night
that
the
dawn
was
near
she
answered
that
ever
in
her
youth
she
awoke
at
the
dawn
to
follow
her
daily
work
and
always
was
she
wont
to
drink
of
whey
and
now
though
the
times
were
changed
she
still
woke
athirst
near
the
dawning
to
elf
it
seemed
strange
that
a
fair
queen
in
her
youth
had
need
to
arise
to
follow
the
plough
in
the
dark
of
the
winter
morning
and
turning
to
the
handmaid
he
asked
of
her
the
same
question
she
replied
that
in
her
youth
her
father
had
given
her
the
gold
ring
she
still
wore
and
which
had
the
magic
power
of
growing
cold
as
the
hours
neared
daybreak
and
such
was
her
dawning
sign
then
did
elf
know
of
their
exchange
and
he
told
hiordis
that
long
had
he
loved
her
and
felt
pity
for
her
sorrow
and
that
he
would
make
her
his
wife
so
that
night
she
sat
on
the
with
the
crown
on
her
head
and
dreamt
of
what
had
been
and
what
was
to
be
so
passeth
the
summer
season
and
the
harvest
of
the
year
and
the
latter
days
of
the
winter
on
toward
the
springtide
wear
book
ii
regin
the
birth
of
sigurd
the
son
of
peace
lay
on
the
land
of
the
helper
and
the
house
of
elf
his
son
there
merry
men
went
bedward
when
their
tide
of
toil
was
done
and
glad
was
the
dawn
awakening
and
the
noontide
fair
and
glad
there
no
great
store
had
the
franklin
and
enough
the
hireling
had
and
a
child
might
go
unguarded
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
with
a
purse
of
gold
at
his
girdle
and
gold
rings
on
his
hand
was
a
country
of
cunning
craftsmen
and
many
a
thing
they
wrought
that
the
lands
of
storm
desired
and
the
homes
of
warfare
sought
but
men
deemed
it
warded
by
more
than
its
stems
of
fight
and
told
how
its
watchers
yet
lived
of
plenteous
might
so
hidden
was
that
country
and
few
men
sailed
its
sea
and
none
came
its
mountains
of
company
but
it
lies
a
goodly
strip
the
mountains
and
the
surging
lip
and
a
perilous
flood
is
its
ocean
and
its
mountains
who
shall
tell
what
things
in
their
dales
deserted
and
their
heaths
may
dwell
again
in
the
house
of
the
helper
there
dwelt
a
certain
man
beardless
and
low
of
stature
of
visage
pinched
and
wan
so
exceeding
old
was
regin
that
no
son
of
man
could
tell
in
what
year
of
the
days
passed
over
he
came
to
that
land
to
dwell
but
the
youth
of
king
elf
had
he
fostered
and
the
helper
youth
thereto
yea
and
his
father
father
the
lore
of
all
men
he
knew
and
was
deft
in
every
cunning
save
the
dealings
of
the
sword
so
sweet
was
his
fashioned
that
men
trowed
his
every
word
his
hand
with
the
blended
was
the
mingler
of
delight
with
the
latter
days
of
sorrow
all
tales
he
told
aright
the
master
of
the
masters
in
the
smithying
craft
was
he
and
he
dealt
with
the
wind
and
the
weather
and
the
stilling
of
the
sea
nor
might
any
learn
him
for
before
that
race
was
made
and
that
generation
all
their
had
he
weighed
in
this
land
of
the
helper
and
elf
his
son
dwelt
hiordis
and
here
her
son
the
last
of
the
volsungs
was
born
the
babe
had
eyes
of
such
wondrous
brightness
that
the
folk
shrank
from
him
while
they
rejoiced
over
his
birth
but
his
mother
spake
to
the
babe
as
to
one
who
might
understand
and
she
told
him
of
sigmund
and
volsung
of
their
wars
and
their
troubles
and
their
joys
then
she
gave
him
to
her
maids
to
bear
him
to
the
kings
of
the
land
that
they
might
rejoice
with
her
but
there
sat
the
helper
of
men
with
king
elf
and
his
earls
in
the
hall
and
they
spake
of
the
deeds
that
had
been
and
told
of
the
times
to
befall
and
they
hearkened
and
heard
sweet
voices
and
the
sound
of
harps
draw
nigh
till
their
hearts
were
exceeding
merry
and
they
knew
not
wherefore
or
why
then
lo
in
the
hall
white
raiment
as
thither
the
damsels
came
and
amid
the
hands
of
the
foremost
was
the
woven
gold
aflame
o
daughters
of
earls
said
the
helper
what
tidings
then
do
ye
bear
is
it
grief
in
the
merry
morning
or
joy
or
wonder
or
fear
quoth
the
first
it
is
grief
for
the
foemen
that
the
masters
of
would
grieve
said
the
next
is
a
wonder
of
wonders
that
the
hearkening
world
shall
believe
a
fear
of
all
fears
said
the
third
for
the
sword
is
uplifted
on
men
a
joy
of
all
joys
said
the
fourth
once
come
and
it
comes
not
again
what
then
hath
betid
said
king
elf
do
the
high
gods
stand
in
our
gate
nay
said
they
else
were
we
silent
and
they
should
be
telling
of
fate
is
the
bidding
come
said
the
helper
that
we
wend
the
gods
to
see
many
summers
and
winters
they
said
ye
shall
live
on
the
earth
it
may
be
speak
then
said
the
ancient
helper
let
the
worst
and
the
best
be
said
they
said
the
earth
is
weary
but
the
tender
blade
hath
sprung
that
shall
wax
till
beneath
its
branches
fair
bloom
the
meadows
green
for
the
gods
and
they
that
were
mighty
were
glad
erewhile
with
the
queen
said
king
elf
how
say
ye
women
of
a
king
do
ye
tell
by
a
god
of
the
heavens
begotten
in
our
fathers
house
to
dwell
by
a
god
of
the
earth
they
answered
but
greater
yet
is
the
son
though
long
were
the
days
of
sigmund
and
great
are
the
deeds
he
hath
done
then
she
with
the
golden
burden
to
the
kingly
stepped
and
away
from
the
baby
the
purple
cloths
she
swept
and
cried
o
king
of
the
people
long
mayst
thou
live
in
bliss
as
our
hearts
today
are
happy
queen
hiordis
sends
thee
this
and
she
saith
that
the
world
shall
call
it
by
the
name
that
thou
shalt
name
now
the
gift
to
thee
is
given
and
to
thee
is
brought
the
fame
then
as
a
man
astonied
king
elf
the
volsung
took
while
his
ancient
timbers
with
the
cry
of
the
shook
with
the
love
of
many
peoples
was
the
wise
king
smitten
through
as
he
hung
the
volsung
but
at
last
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
forth
kind
his
people
and
spake
aloud
and
said
o
sigmund
king
of
battle
o
man
of
many
days
whom
i
saw
mid
the
shields
of
the
fallen
and
the
dead
men
silent
praise
lo
how
hath
the
dark
tide
perished
and
the
dawn
of
day
begun
and
now
o
mighty
sigmund
wherewith
shall
we
name
thy
son
but
there
rose
up
a
man
most
ancient
and
he
cried
hail
dawn
of
the
day
how
many
things
shalt
thou
quicken
how
many
shalt
thou
slay
how
many
things
shalt
thou
waken
how
many
lull
to
sleep
how
many
things
shalt
thou
scatter
how
many
gather
and
keep
o
me
how
thy
love
shall
cherish
how
thine
hate
shall
wither
and
burn
how
the
hope
shall
be
sped
from
thy
right
hand
nor
the
fear
to
thy
left
return
o
thy
deeds
that
men
shall
sing
of
o
thy
deeds
that
the
gods
shall
see
o
sigurd
son
of
the
volsungs
o
victory
yet
to
be
men
heard
the
name
and
they
knew
it
and
they
caught
it
up
in
the
air
and
it
went
abroad
by
the
windows
and
the
doors
of
the
fair
it
went
through
street
and
market
meadow
and
acre
it
went
and
over
the
forest
and
the
dearth
of
the
bent
and
over
the
welter
till
the
folk
of
the
fishers
heard
and
the
hearts
of
the
on
the
rocks
were
stirred
getteth
to
him
the
horse
that
is
called
now
waxeth
the
son
of
sigmund
in
might
and
goodliness
and
soft
the
days
win
over
and
all
men
his
beauty
bless
but
amidst
the
summer
season
was
the
hiordis
wed
to
king
elf
the
son
of
the
helper
and
fair
their
sped
peace
lay
on
the
land
for
ever
and
the
fields
gave
good
increase
and
there
was
sigurd
waxing
mid
the
plenty
and
the
peace
now
hath
the
child
grown
greater
and
is
keen
and
eager
of
wit
and
full
of
understanding
and
oft
hath
he
joy
to
sit
amid
talk
of
weighty
matters
when
the
wise
men
meet
for
speech
and
joyous
he
is
moreover
and
blithe
and
kind
with
each
but
regin
the
wise
craftsmaster
heedeth
the
youngling
well
and
before
the
kings
he
cometh
and
saith
such
words
to
tell
i
have
fostered
thy
youth
king
elf
and
thine
o
helper
of
men
and
ye
wot
that
such
a
master
no
king
shall
see
again
and
now
would
i
foster
sigurd
for
though
he
be
none
of
thy
blood
mine
heart
of
his
days
that
shall
be
speaketh
abundant
good
then
spake
the
helper
of
yea
do
herein
thy
will
for
thou
art
the
master
of
masters
and
hast
learned
me
all
my
skill
but
think
how
bright
is
this
youngling
and
thy
guile
from
him
withhold
for
this
craft
of
thine
hath
shown
me
that
thy
heart
is
grim
and
cold
though
three
men
lives
thrice
over
thy
wisdom
might
not
learn
and
i
love
this
son
of
sigmund
and
mine
heart
to
him
doth
yearn
then
regin
laughed
and
answered
i
doled
out
cunning
to
thee
but
nought
with
him
will
i
measure
yet
no
shall
he
be
nor
grim
nor
for
my
will
might
frame
gone
forth
is
the
word
of
the
norns
that
abideth
ever
the
same
and
now
despite
my
cunning
how
deem
ye
i
shall
die
and
they
said
he
would
live
as
he
listed
and
at
last
in
peace
should
lie
when
he
listed
to
live
no
longer
so
mighty
and
wise
he
was
but
again
he
laughed
and
answered
one
day
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
a
beardless
youth
shall
slay
me
i
know
the
fateful
doom
but
nought
may
i
withstand
it
as
it
heaves
up
dim
through
the
gloom
so
is
sigurd
now
with
regin
and
he
learns
him
many
things
yea
all
save
the
craft
of
battle
that
men
learned
the
sons
of
kings
the
smithying
sword
and
the
carving
runes
aright
the
tongues
of
many
countries
and
soft
speech
for
men
delight
the
dealing
with
the
and
the
winding
ways
of
song
so
wise
of
heart
waxed
sigurd
and
of
body
wondrous
strong
and
he
chased
the
deer
of
the
forest
and
many
a
slew
and
many
a
bull
of
the
mountains
and
the
desert
dales
he
knew
and
the
heaths
that
the
wind
sweeps
over
and
seaward
would
he
fare
far
out
from
the
outer
skerries
and
alone
the
dare
one
day
did
regin
tell
sigurd
of
deeds
done
in
the
past
by
kings
both
bold
and
wise
and
the
lad
longed
too
to
do
the
like
and
his
bright
eyes
glowed
with
desire
and
regin
told
him
that
he
should
follow
his
volsung
fathers
and
roam
far
and
wide
leaving
the
and
who
had
cherished
his
youth
this
roused
sigurd
wrath
for
he
would
have
nought
said
against
those
who
had
reared
him
but
regin
bade
him
ask
for
one
of
the
horses
of
gripir
and
banished
his
anger
by
a
song
of
the
deeds
of
the
choosers
of
the
slain
before
the
song
was
finished
sigurd
went
to
king
elf
and
asked
that
he
might
have
authority
to
seek
a
horse
from
king
gripir
then
smiled
king
elf
and
answered
a
long
way
wilt
thou
ride
to
where
unpeace
and
troubles
and
the
griefs
of
the
soul
abide
yea
unto
the
death
at
the
last
yet
surely
shall
thou
win
the
praise
of
many
a
people
so
have
thy
way
herein
forsooth
no
more
may
we
hold
thee
than
the
hazel
copse
may
hold
the
sun
of
the
early
dawning
that
turneth
it
all
unto
gold
then
sweetly
sigurd
thanked
them
and
through
the
night
he
lay
mid
dreams
of
many
a
matter
till
the
dawn
was
on
the
way
then
he
shook
the
sleep
from
off
him
and
that
dwelling
of
kings
he
left
and
wended
his
ways
unto
gripir
on
a
crag
from
the
mountain
reft
was
the
house
of
the
old
king
builded
and
a
mighty
house
it
was
though
few
were
the
sons
of
men
that
over
its
threshold
would
pass
but
the
wild
ernes
cried
about
it
and
the
vultures
toward
it
flew
and
the
winds
from
the
heart
of
the
mountains
searched
every
chamber
through
and
about
were
meads
and
many
a
beast
thereon
yea
some
that
are
terror
their
sport
and
pasture
won
so
into
the
hall
went
sigurd
and
amidst
was
gripir
set
in
a
chair
of
the
tooth
and
his
sweeping
beard
nigh
met
the
floor
that
was
green
as
the
ocean
and
his
gown
was
of
and
the
kingly
staff
in
his
hand
was
knobbed
with
the
crystal
cold
now
the
first
of
the
twain
spake
gripir
hail
king
with
the
eyen
bright
nought
needest
thou
show
the
token
for
i
know
of
thy
life
and
thy
light
and
no
need
to
tell
of
thy
message
it
was
wafted
here
on
the
wind
that
thou
wouldst
be
coming
today
a
horse
in
my
meadow
to
find
and
strong
must
he
be
for
the
bearing
of
those
deeds
of
thine
that
shall
be
now
choose
thou
of
all
the
that
are
running
loose
in
my
lea
then
again
gat
sigurd
outward
and
adown
the
steep
he
ran
and
unto
the
meadow
but
lo
a
man
and
seeming
ancient
there
met
him
by
the
way
and
he
spake
thou
hastest
sigurd
yet
tarry
till
i
say
a
word
that
shall
well
bestead
thee
for
i
know
of
these
mountains
well
and
all
the
lea
of
gripir
and
the
beasts
that
thereon
dwell
wouldst
thou
have
red
gold
for
thy
tidings
art
thou
gripir
then
nay
sure
for
thy
face
is
shining
like
the
men
my
master
regin
tells
of
and
i
love
thy
gown
and
thy
visage
gleams
above
it
like
a
thing
my
dreams
have
known
nay
whiles
have
i
heeded
the
then
spake
that
elder
of
days
and
sooth
do
the
sages
say
when
the
beasts
of
my
breeding
they
praise
there
is
one
thereof
in
the
meadow
and
wouldst
thou
cull
him
out
thou
shalt
follow
an
elder
counsel
who
hath
brought
strange
things
about
who
hath
known
thy
father
aforetime
and
other
kings
of
thy
kin
so
sigurd
said
i
am
ready
and
what
is
the
deed
to
win
he
said
we
shall
drive
the
horses
adown
to
the
that
cometh
forth
from
the
mountains
and
note
what
next
shall
betide
then
the
twain
sped
on
together
and
they
drave
the
horses
on
till
they
came
to
a
rushing
river
a
water
wide
and
wan
and
the
white
mews
hovered
it
but
none
might
hear
their
cry
for
the
rush
and
the
rattle
of
waters
as
the
downlong
flood
swept
by
so
the
whole
herd
took
the
river
and
strove
the
stream
to
stem
and
many
a
brave
steed
was
there
but
the
flood
them
and
some
it
swept
them
and
some
won
back
to
bank
some
caught
by
the
net
of
the
eddies
in
the
swirling
hubbub
sank
but
one
of
all
swam
over
and
they
saw
his
mane
of
grey
toss
over
the
flowery
meadows
a
bright
thing
far
away
wide
then
he
wheeled
about
them
then
took
the
stream
again
and
with
the
waves
white
horses
mingled
his
cloudy
mane
then
spake
the
elder
of
days
hearken
now
sigurd
and
hear
time
was
when
i
gave
thy
father
a
gift
thou
shalt
yet
deem
dear
and
this
horse
is
a
gift
of
my
giving
heed
nought
where
thou
mayst
ride
for
i
have
seen
thy
fathers
in
a
shining
house
abide
and
on
earth
they
thought
of
its
threshold
and
the
gifts
i
had
to
give
nor
prayed
for
a
little
longer
and
a
little
longer
to
live
then
forth
he
strode
to
the
mountains
and
fain
was
sigurd
now
to
ask
him
many
a
matter
but
dim
did
his
bright
shape
grow
as
a
man
from
the
litten
doorway
fades
into
the
dusk
of
night
and
the
sun
in
the
shone
and
the
world
was
exceeding
bright
so
sigurd
turned
to
the
river
and
stood
by
the
strand
and
the
grey
horse
swims
to
his
feet
and
lightly
leaps
aland
and
the
youngling
looks
upon
him
and
deems
none
beside
him
good
and
indeed
as
tells
the
story
he
was
come
of
sleipnir
blood
the
tireless
horse
of
odin
he
was
of
hue
and
it
seemed
as
sigurd
backed
him
that
sigmund
son
he
knew
so
glad
he
went
beneath
him
then
the
youngling
song
arose
as
he
brushed
through
the
noontide
blossoms
of
gripir
mighty
close
then
he
singeth
the
song
of
greyfell
the
horse
that
odin
gave
who
swam
through
the
sweeping
river
and
back
through
the
toppling
wave
telleth
sigurd
of
his
kindred
and
of
the
gold
that
was
accursed
from
ancient
now
yet
the
days
pass
over
and
more
than
words
may
tell
grows
sigurd
strong
and
lovely
and
all
children
love
him
well
but
oft
he
looks
on
the
mountains
and
many
a
time
is
fain
to
know
of
what
lies
beyond
them
and
learn
of
the
wide
world
gain
now
again
it
happed
on
a
day
that
he
sat
in
regin
hall
and
hearkened
many
tidings
of
what
had
chanced
to
fall
and
of
kings
that
sought
their
kingdoms
many
a
waste
and
wild
and
at
last
saith
the
crafty
master
thou
art
king
sigmund
child
wilt
thou
wait
till
these
kings
of
the
carles
shall
die
in
a
little
land
or
wilt
thou
serve
their
sons
and
carry
the
cup
to
their
hand
or
abide
in
vain
for
the
day
that
never
shall
come
about
when
their
banners
shall
dance
in
the
wind
and
shake
to
the
shout
then
sigurd
answered
and
said
nought
such
do
i
look
to
be
but
thou
a
deedless
man
too
much
thou
eggest
me
and
these
folk
are
good
and
trusty
and
the
land
is
lovely
and
sweet
and
in
rest
and
in
peace
it
lieth
as
the
floor
of
odin
feet
yet
i
know
that
the
world
is
wide
and
filled
with
deeds
unwrought
and
for
such
work
was
i
fashioned
lest
the
songcraft
come
to
nought
then
answered
regin
the
guileful
the
deed
is
ready
to
hand
yet
holding
my
peace
is
the
best
for
well
thou
lovest
the
land
and
thou
lovest
thy
life
moreover
and
the
peace
of
thy
youthful
days
and
why
should
the
feaster
his
hand
to
the
raise
yet
they
say
that
sigmund
begat
thee
and
he
looked
to
fashion
a
man
fear
nought
he
lieth
quiet
in
his
mound
by
the
wan
so
shone
the
eyes
of
sigurd
that
the
shield
against
him
hung
cast
back
their
light
as
the
sunbeams
but
his
voice
to
the
rung
tell
me
thou
master
of
masters
what
deed
is
the
deed
i
shall
do
nor
mock
thou
the
son
of
sigmund
lest
the
day
of
his
birth
thou
rue
then
answered
the
master
of
sleight
the
deed
is
the
righting
of
wrong
and
the
quelling
a
bale
and
a
sorrow
that
the
world
hath
endured
and
the
winning
a
treasure
untold
that
shall
make
thee
more
than
the
kings
thereof
is
the
helm
of
aweing
the
wonder
of
earthly
things
and
thereof
is
its
very
fellow
the
all
of
gold
that
has
not
its
like
in
the
heavens
nor
has
earth
of
its
fellow
told
then
answered
sigurd
the
volsung
how
long
hereof
hast
thou
known
and
what
unto
thee
is
this
treasure
that
thou
seemest
to
give
as
thine
own
alas
quoth
the
smithying
master
it
is
mine
yet
none
of
mine
since
my
heart
herein
avails
not
and
my
hand
is
frail
and
fine
it
is
long
since
i
first
came
hither
to
seek
a
man
for
my
need
for
i
saw
by
a
glimmering
light
that
hence
would
spring
the
deed
and
many
a
deed
of
the
world
but
the
generations
passed
and
the
first
of
the
days
was
as
near
to
the
end
that
i
sought
as
the
last
till
i
looked
on
thine
eyes
in
the
cradle
and
now
i
deem
through
thee
that
the
end
of
my
days
of
waiting
and
the
end
of
my
woes
shall
be
then
sigurd
awhile
was
silent
but
at
last
he
answered
and
said
thou
shalt
have
thy
will
and
the
treasure
and
shalt
take
the
curse
on
thine
head
if
a
curse
the
gold
enwrappeth
but
the
deed
will
i
surely
do
for
today
the
dreams
of
my
childhood
hath
bloomed
in
my
heart
anew
and
i
long
to
look
on
the
world
and
the
glory
of
the
earth
and
to
deal
in
the
dealings
of
men
and
garner
the
harvest
of
worth
but
tell
me
thou
master
of
masters
where
lieth
this
measureless
wealth
is
it
guarded
by
swords
of
the
or
kept
by
cunning
and
stealth
is
it
over
the
main
sea
darkness
or
beyond
the
mountain
wall
or
in
these
peaceful
acres
anigh
to
the
hands
of
all
then
regin
answered
sweetly
hereof
must
a
tale
be
told
bide
sitting
thou
son
of
sigmund
on
the
heap
of
unwrought
gold
and
hearken
of
wondrous
matters
and
of
things
unheard
unsaid
and
deeds
of
my
beholding
ere
the
first
of
kings
was
made
and
first
ye
shall
know
of
a
sooth
that
i
never
was
born
of
the
race
which
the
masters
of
have
made
to
cover
the
fair
earth
face
but
i
come
of
the
dwarfs
departed
and
fair
was
the
earth
whileome
ere
the
thralls
of
the
gods
amidst
its
dales
were
come
it
was
reidmar
the
ancient
begat
me
and
now
was
he
waxen
old
and
a
covetous
man
and
a
king
and
he
bade
and
i
built
him
a
hall
and
a
golden
glorious
house
and
thereto
his
sons
did
he
call
and
he
bade
them
be
evil
and
wise
that
his
will
through
them
might
be
wrought
then
he
gave
unto
fafnir
my
brother
the
soul
that
feareth
nought
and
the
brow
of
the
hardened
iron
and
the
hand
that
may
never
fail
and
the
greedy
heart
of
a
king
and
the
ear
that
hears
no
wail
but
next
unto
otter
my
brother
he
gave
the
snare
and
the
net
and
the
longing
to
wend
through
the
and
wade
the
highways
wet
and
the
foot
that
never
resteth
while
aught
be
left
alive
that
hath
cunning
to
match
man
cunning
or
might
with
his
might
to
strive
and
to
me
the
least
and
the
youngest
what
gift
for
the
slaying
of
ease
save
the
grief
that
remembers
the
past
and
the
fear
that
the
future
sees
and
the
hammer
and
and
the
living
coal
of
fire
and
the
craft
that
createth
a
semblance
and
fails
of
the
heart
desire
and
the
toil
that
each
dawning
quickens
and
the
task
that
is
never
done
and
the
heart
that
longeth
ever
nor
will
look
to
the
deed
that
is
won
thus
gave
my
father
the
gifts
that
might
never
be
taken
again
far
worse
were
we
now
than
the
gods
and
but
little
better
than
men
but
yet
of
our
ancient
might
one
thing
had
we
left
us
still
we
had
craft
to
change
our
semblance
and
could
shift
us
at
our
will
into
bodies
of
the
or
fowl
or
fishes
cold
so
dwelt
we
brethren
and
father
and
fafnir
my
brother
fared
as
the
scourge
and
compeller
of
all
things
and
left
no
wrong
undared
but
for
me
i
toiled
and
i
toiled
and
fair
grew
my
father
house
but
writhen
and
foul
were
the
hands
that
had
made
it
glorious
and
myself
a
little
fragment
amidst
it
all
i
saw
grim
and
unmighty
as
the
straw
let
for
otter
my
brother
saw
seldom
field
or
fold
and
he
oftenest
used
that
custom
whereof
now
i
told
and
would
shift
his
shape
with
the
and
the
things
of
land
and
sea
and
he
knew
what
joy
their
hearts
had
and
what
they
longed
to
be
and
their
understanding
and
his
waxed
so
great
that
he
seemed
the
king
of
the
creatures
and
their
very
mortal
fate
now
as
the
years
won
over
three
folk
of
the
heavenly
halls
grew
aweary
of
sleepless
sloth
and
the
day
that
nought
befalls
and
they
fain
would
look
on
the
earth
and
their
latest
handiwork
and
turn
the
fine
gold
over
lest
a
flaw
therein
should
lurk
and
the
three
were
the
odin
the
father
of
the
slain
and
loki
the
world
begrudger
who
maketh
all
labour
vain
and
hoenir
the
who
wrought
the
hope
of
man
and
his
heart
and
inmost
yearnings
when
first
the
work
began
the
three
wandered
over
the
earth
till
they
came
to
a
mighty
river
haunted
for
long
by
otter
by
reason
of
its
great
wealth
of
fish
there
he
lay
on
the
bank
and
as
he
watched
the
fish
in
the
water
his
shape
was
changed
to
that
of
a
true
otter
and
he
began
to
devour
a
golden
trout
two
of
the
gods
would
have
passed
without
stay
but
in
the
otter
loki
saw
an
enemy
and
straightway
killed
him
rejoicing
over
his
dead
body
as
night
fell
the
three
gods
came
to
a
great
hall
wondrously
wrought
and
carved
with
golden
hangings
and
forests
of
pillars
in
the
midst
of
the
hall
sat
a
king
on
an
ivory
throne
and
his
garments
were
made
of
purple
from
the
sea
kind
welcome
he
gave
to
the
wanderers
and
there
they
feasted
and
delighted
in
music
and
song
but
even
as
they
drank
and
made
merry
they
knew
they
were
caught
in
the
snare
the
king
welcome
changed
to
scornful
laughter
and
thus
he
spoke
truly
are
ye
gods
but
ye
are
come
to
people
who
want
you
not
before
ye
were
known
to
us
still
was
the
winter
cold
and
the
summer
warm
and
still
could
we
find
meat
and
drink
i
am
reidmar
and
ye
come
straight
from
the
slaying
of
reidmar
son
shall
i
not
then
take
the
vengeance
i
will
unless
indeed
ye
give
me
the
treasure
i
covet
and
then
shall
ye
go
your
way
this
is
my
sentence
choose
ye
which
ye
will
then
spake
the
wise
allfather
and
prayed
reidmar
to
unsay
his
word
and
cease
to
desire
the
gold
but
reidmar
the
wise
and
fafnir
the
lord
and
regin
the
worker
cried
aloud
in
their
wrath
hearken
gods
of
the
goths
ye
shall
die
and
we
shall
be
gods
and
rule
your
men
beloved
with
rods
and
make
them
beasts
beneath
us
save
today
ye
do
our
will
and
pay
us
the
ransom
of
blood
and
our
hearts
with
the
gold
fulfill
but
odin
spake
in
answer
and
his
voice
was
awful
and
cold
righteous
doom
o
reidmar
say
what
ye
will
of
the
gold
then
reidmar
laughed
in
his
heart
and
his
wrath
and
his
wisdom
fled
and
nought
but
his
greed
abided
and
he
spake
from
his
throne
and
said
hearken
the
doom
i
shall
speak
ye
shall
be
free
when
ye
give
me
the
flame
of
the
waters
the
gathered
gold
of
the
sea
that
andvari
hideth
rejoicing
in
the
wan
realm
pale
as
the
grave
and
the
master
of
sleight
shall
fetch
it
and
the
hand
that
never
gave
and
the
heart
that
begrudgeth
for
ever
shall
gather
and
give
and
rue
lo
this
is
the
doom
of
the
wise
and
no
doom
shall
be
spoken
anew
then
odin
spake
is
well
the
curser
shall
seek
for
the
curse
and
the
greedy
shall
cherish
the
evil
and
the
seed
of
the
great
they
shall
nurse
no
word
spake
reidmar
the
great
for
the
eyes
of
his
heart
were
turned
to
the
edge
of
the
outer
desert
so
sore
for
the
gold
he
yearned
but
loki
i
loosed
from
the
toils
and
he
goeth
his
way
abroad
and
the
heart
of
odin
he
knoweth
and
where
he
shall
seek
the
hoard
there
is
a
desert
of
dread
in
the
uttermost
part
of
the
world
where
over
a
wall
of
mountains
is
a
mighty
water
hurled
whose
hidden
head
none
knoweth
nor
where
it
meeteth
the
sea
and
that
force
is
the
force
of
andvari
and
an
elf
of
the
dark
is
he
in
the
cloud
and
the
desert
he
dwelleth
amid
that
land
alone
and
his
work
is
the
storing
of
treasure
within
his
house
of
stone
time
was
when
he
knew
of
wisdom
and
had
many
a
tale
to
tell
of
the
days
before
the
and
of
what
in
that
world
befell
and
he
knew
of
the
stars
and
the
sun
and
the
worlds
that
come
and
go
on
the
nether
rim
of
heaven
and
whence
the
wind
doth
blow
and
how
the
sea
hangs
balanced
betwixt
the
curving
lands
and
how
all
drew
together
for
the
first
gods
fashioning
hands
but
now
is
all
gone
from
him
save
the
craft
of
gathering
gold
and
he
heedeth
nought
of
the
summer
nor
knoweth
the
winter
cold
nor
looks
to
the
sun
nor
the
snowfall
nor
ever
dreams
of
the
sea
nor
hath
heard
of
the
making
of
nor
of
where
the
high
gods
be
but
ever
he
gripeth
and
gathereth
and
he
toileth
hour
by
hour
nor
knoweth
the
noon
from
the
midnight
as
he
looks
on
his
stony
bower
and
saith
is
short
it
is
narrow
for
all
i
shall
gather
and
get
for
the
world
is
but
newly
fashioned
and
long
shall
its
years
be
yet
there
loki
fareth
and
seeth
in
a
land
of
nothing
good
far
off
the
empty
desert
the
reek
of
the
falling
flood
go
up
to
the
floor
of
heaven
and
thither
turn
his
feet
as
he
weaveth
the
unseen
meshes
and
the
snare
of
strong
deceit
so
he
cometh
his
ways
to
the
water
where
the
glittering
glows
and
the
huge
flood
leaps
the
and
a
green
arch
over
it
throws
there
under
the
roof
of
water
he
treads
the
quivering
floor
and
the
hush
of
the
desert
is
felt
amid
the
water
roar
and
the
bleak
sun
lighteth
the
and
tells
of
the
fruitless
plain
and
the
showers
that
nourish
nothing
and
the
summer
come
in
vain
there
did
the
great
his
toils
and
his
tangles
set
and
as
wide
as
was
the
water
so
wide
was
woven
the
net
and
as
dim
as
the
elf
remembrance
did
the
meshes
of
it
show
and
he
had
no
thought
of
sorrow
nor
spared
to
come
and
go
on
his
errands
of
griping
and
getting
till
he
felt
himself
tangled
and
caught
then
back
to
his
blinded
soul
was
his
ancient
wisdom
brought
and
he
saw
his
fall
and
his
ruin
as
a
man
by
the
lightning
flame
sees
the
garth
all
flooded
by
foemen
and
again
he
remembered
his
name
and
as
a
book
well
written
the
tale
of
the
gods
he
knew
and
the
tale
of
the
making
of
men
and
much
of
the
deeds
they
should
do
then
andvari
groaned
and
answered
know
what
thou
wouldst
have
the
wealth
mine
own
hands
gathered
the
gold
that
no
man
gave
forth
said
loki
give
it
and
dwell
in
peace
henceforth
or
die
in
the
toils
if
thou
listeth
if
thy
life
be
nothing
worth
full
sore
the
elf
lamented
but
he
came
before
the
god
and
the
twain
went
into
the
and
on
fine
gold
they
trod
and
the
walls
shone
bright
and
brighter
than
the
sun
of
the
upper
air
how
great
was
that
treasure
of
treasures
and
the
helm
of
dread
was
there
the
world
but
in
dreams
had
seen
it
and
there
was
the
hauberk
of
gold
none
other
is
in
the
heavens
nor
has
earth
of
its
fellow
told
then
loki
bade
the
bring
all
to
the
upper
day
and
he
dight
himself
with
his
godhead
to
bear
the
treasure
away
so
there
in
the
dim
grey
desert
before
the
god
of
guile
great
heaps
of
the
treasure
the
weary
elf
must
pile
and
loki
looked
on
laughing
but
when
it
all
was
done
and
the
elf
was
hurrying
homeward
his
finger
gleamed
in
the
sun
then
loki
cried
art
guileful
thou
hast
not
learned
the
tale
of
the
wisdom
that
gods
hath
gotten
and
their
might
of
all
avail
hither
again
to
thy
master
and
give
the
ring
to
me
for
meseems
it
is
loki
portion
and
the
bale
of
men
shall
it
be
then
the
elf
drew
off
the
and
stood
with
empty
hand
where
the
flood
fell
over
the
water
and
the
land
and
he
gazed
on
the
great
and
huge
and
grim
he
grew
and
his
anguish
swelled
within
him
and
the
word
of
the
norns
he
knew
how
that
gold
was
the
seed
of
gold
to
the
wise
and
the
shapers
of
things
the
hoarders
of
hidden
treasure
and
the
unseen
glory
of
rings
but
the
seed
of
woe
to
the
world
and
the
foolish
wasters
of
men
and
grief
to
the
generations
that
die
and
spring
again
then
he
cried
farest
thou
loki
and
might
i
load
thee
worse
than
with
what
thine
ill
heart
beareth
then
shouldst
thou
bear
my
curse
but
for
men
a
curse
thou
bearest
entangled
in
my
gold
amid
my
woe
abideth
another
woe
untold
two
brethren
and
a
father
eight
kings
my
grief
shall
slay
and
the
hearts
of
queens
shall
be
broken
and
their
eyes
shall
loathe
the
day
but
loki
laughed
in
silence
and
swift
in
godhead
went
to
the
golden
hall
of
reidmar
and
the
house
of
our
content
but
when
that
world
of
treasure
was
laid
within
our
hall
was
as
if
the
sun
were
minded
to
live
wall
and
wall
and
all
we
stood
by
and
panted
then
odin
spake
and
said
kings
o
folk
of
the
lo
the
ransom
duly
paid
will
ye
have
this
sun
of
the
ocean
and
reap
the
fruitful
field
and
garner
up
the
harvest
that
earth
therefrom
shall
yield
so
he
spake
but
a
little
season
nought
answered
reidmar
the
wise
but
turned
his
face
from
the
treasure
and
peered
with
eager
eyes
endlong
the
hall
and
athwart
it
as
a
man
may
chase
about
a
ray
of
the
sun
of
the
morning
that
a
naked
sword
throws
out
and
lo
from
loki
came
the
flash
of
the
fruitful
ring
and
at
last
spake
reidmar
scowling
wait
for
my
that
your
feet
may
go
free
on
the
earth
and
the
fear
of
my
toils
may
be
done
that
then
ye
may
say
in
your
laughter
the
fools
of
the
time
agone
the
purblind
eyes
of
the
they
have
gotten
the
garnered
sheaf
and
have
let
their
masters
depart
with
the
seed
of
gold
and
of
grief
o
loki
friend
of
allfather
cast
down
andvari
ring
or
the
world
shall
yet
turn
backward
and
the
high
heavens
lack
a
king
then
loki
drew
off
the
and
cast
it
down
on
the
heap
and
forth
as
the
gold
met
gold
did
the
light
of
its
glory
leap
but
he
spake
rejoiceth
my
heart
that
no
whit
of
all
ye
shall
lack
lest
the
curse
of
the
cleave
not
and
ye
the
utter
wrack
then
regin
loosed
the
shackles
of
the
gods
and
they
departed
into
the
night
but
odin
stayed
in
the
doorway
and
thus
he
spake
why
do
ye
thus
desire
treasure
and
take
sorrow
to
yourselves
know
ye
not
that
i
was
before
your
fathers
fathers
and
that
i
can
foresee
your
fate
and
the
end
of
the
gold
ye
covet
i
am
the
wise
one
who
ordereth
all
then
they
went
but
regin
afterwards
often
recalled
odin
words
and
the
evening
filled
with
the
gleam
of
the
gold
but
little
cared
he
then
so
well
he
loved
the
gold
and
he
prayed
his
father
to
keep
the
treasure
but
give
a
little
unto
him
and
fafnir
for
the
help
they
had
given
him
that
day
his
father
in
no
wise
heeded
his
words
but
sat
ever
on
his
ivory
throne
staring
moodily
at
the
gold
but
fafnir
grew
fierce
and
grim
as
he
watched
him
the
night
waned
into
the
morning
and
still
above
the
hoard
sat
reidmar
clad
in
purple
but
fafnir
took
his
sword
and
i
took
my
and
apart
in
the
world
we
went
but
i
came
aback
in
the
even
and
my
heart
was
heavy
and
spent
and
i
longed
but
fear
was
upon
me
and
i
durst
not
go
to
the
gold
so
i
lay
in
the
house
of
my
toil
mid
the
things
i
had
fashioned
of
old
and
methought
as
i
lay
in
my
bed
waking
and
slumber
of
night
that
i
heard
the
tinkling
metal
and
beheld
the
hall
alight
but
i
slept
and
dreamed
of
the
gods
and
the
things
that
never
have
slept
till
i
woke
to
a
cry
and
a
clashing
and
forth
from
the
bed
i
leapt
and
there
by
the
my
brother
fafnir
stood
and
there
at
his
feet
lay
reidmar
and
reddened
the
treasure
with
blood
and
as
i
looked
on
his
eyen
they
glazed
and
whitened
with
death
and
forth
on
the
hall
he
shed
his
latest
breath
but
i
looked
on
fafnir
and
trembled
for
he
wore
the
helm
of
dread
and
his
sword
was
bare
in
his
hand
and
the
sword
and
the
hand
were
red
with
the
blood
of
our
father
reidmar
and
his
body
was
wrapped
in
gold
with
the
mailcoat
of
whose
fellow
hath
nought
been
told
and
it
seemed
as
i
looked
upon
him
that
he
grew
beneath
mine
eyes
and
then
in
the
silence
did
his
dreadful
voice
arise
have
slain
my
father
reidmar
that
i
alone
might
keep
the
gold
of
the
darksome
places
the
candle
of
the
deep
i
am
such
as
the
gods
have
made
me
lest
the
people
the
earth
or
mingle
their
ancient
wisdom
with
its
latest
birth
i
shall
dwell
alone
henceforward
and
the
gold
and
its
waxing
curse
i
shall
brood
on
them
both
together
let
my
life
grow
better
or
worse
and
i
am
a
king
henceforward
and
long
shall
be
my
life
and
the
gold
shall
grow
with
my
longing
for
i
shall
hide
it
from
strife
and
hoard
up
the
ring
of
andvari
in
the
house
thine
hand
hath
built
o
thou
wilt
thou
tarry
and
tarry
till
i
cast
thy
blood
on
the
guilt
lo
i
am
a
king
for
ever
and
alone
on
the
gold
shall
i
dwell
and
do
no
deed
to
repent
of
and
leave
no
tale
to
tell
more
awful
grew
his
visage
as
he
spake
the
word
of
dread
and
no
more
durst
i
behold
him
but
with
heart
i
fled
i
fled
from
the
glorious
house
my
hands
had
made
so
fair
as
poor
as
the
baby
with
nought
of
raiment
or
gear
i
fled
from
the
heaps
of
gold
and
my
goods
were
the
eager
will
and
the
heart
that
remembereth
all
and
the
hand
that
may
never
be
still
then
unto
this
land
i
came
and
that
was
long
ago
as
count
the
years
and
i
taught
them
to
reap
and
to
sow
and
i
grew
the
master
of
masters
think
thou
how
strange
it
is
that
the
sword
in
the
hands
of
a
stripling
shall
one
day
end
all
this
yet
oft
mid
all
my
wisdom
did
i
long
for
my
brother
part
and
fafnir
mighty
kingship
weighed
heavy
on
my
heart
when
the
kings
of
the
earthly
kingdoms
would
give
me
golden
gifts
from
out
of
their
scanty
treasures
due
pay
for
my
cunning
shifts
and
once
didst
thou
number
the
years
thou
wouldst
think
it
long
ago
i
wandered
away
to
the
country
from
whence
our
stem
did
grow
then
i
went
to
the
pillared
and
lo
huge
heaps
of
gold
and
to
and
fro
amidst
them
a
mighty
serpent
rolled
then
my
heart
grew
chill
with
terror
for
i
thought
on
the
wont
of
our
race
and
i
who
had
lost
their
cunning
was
a
man
in
a
deadly
place
a
feeble
man
and
a
swordless
in
the
lone
destroyer
fold
for
i
knew
that
the
worm
was
fafnir
the
wallower
on
the
gold
so
i
gathered
my
strength
and
fled
and
hid
my
shame
again
mid
the
foolish
sons
of
and
the
more
my
hope
was
vain
the
more
i
longed
for
the
treasure
and
from
the
yoke
and
yet
passed
the
generations
and
i
dwelt
with
the
folk
long
years
and
long
years
after
the
tale
of
told
how
up
on
the
glittering
heath
was
the
house
and
the
dwelling
of
gold
and
within
that
house
was
the
serpent
and
the
lord
of
the
fearful
face
then
i
wondered
sore
of
the
desert
for
i
thought
of
the
golden
place
my
hands
of
old
had
builded
for
i
knew
by
many
a
sign
that
the
fearful
face
was
my
brother
that
the
blood
of
the
worm
was
mine
this
was
ages
long
ago
and
yet
in
that
desert
he
dwells
betwixt
him
and
men
death
lieth
and
no
man
of
his
semblance
tells
but
the
tale
of
the
great
is
never
the
more
outworn
then
came
thy
kin
o
sigurd
and
thy
father
father
was
born
and
i
fell
to
the
dreaming
of
dreams
and
i
saw
thine
eyes
therein
and
i
looked
and
beheld
thy
glory
and
all
that
thy
sword
should
win
and
i
thought
that
thou
shouldst
be
he
who
should
bring
my
heart
its
rest
that
of
all
the
gifts
of
the
kings
thy
sword
should
give
me
the
best
ah
i
fell
to
the
dreaming
of
dreams
and
oft
the
gold
i
saw
and
the
hauberk
without
a
flaw
and
the
helm
that
aweth
the
world
and
i
knew
of
fafnir
heart
that
his
wisdom
was
greater
than
mine
because
he
had
held
him
apart
nor
spilt
on
the
sons
of
our
knowledge
of
ancient
days
nor
bartered
one
whit
for
their
love
nor
craved
for
the
people
praise
and
some
day
i
shall
have
it
all
his
gold
and
his
craft
and
his
heart
and
the
gathered
and
garnered
wisdom
he
guards
in
the
mountains
apart
and
he
spake
hast
thou
hearkened
sigurd
wilt
thou
help
a
man
that
is
old
to
avenge
him
for
his
father
wilt
thou
win
that
treasure
of
gold
and
be
more
than
the
kings
of
the
earth
wilt
thou
rid
the
earth
of
a
wrong
and
heal
the
woe
and
the
sorrow
my
heart
hath
endured
then
sigurd
looked
upon
him
with
steadfast
eyes
and
clear
and
regin
drooped
and
trembled
as
he
stood
the
doom
to
hear
but
the
bright
child
spake
as
aforetime
and
answered
the
master
and
said
thou
shalt
have
thy
will
and
the
treasure
and
take
the
curse
on
thine
head
the
forging
of
the
sword
that
is
called
the
wrath
of
but
when
the
morrow
was
come
he
went
to
his
mother
and
spake
the
shards
the
shards
of
the
sword
that
thou
gleanedst
for
my
sake
in
the
night
on
the
field
of
slaughter
in
the
tide
when
my
father
fell
hast
thou
kept
them
through
sorrow
and
joyance
hast
thou
warded
them
trusty
and
well
where
hast
thou
laid
them
my
mother
then
she
looked
upon
him
and
said
art
thou
wroth
o
sigurd
my
son
that
such
eyes
are
in
thine
head
and
wilt
thou
be
wroth
with
thy
mother
do
i
withstand
thee
at
all
nay
said
he
nought
am
i
wrathful
but
the
days
rise
up
like
a
wall
betwixt
my
soul
and
the
deeds
and
i
strive
to
rend
them
through
now
give
me
the
sword
my
mother
that
sigmund
gave
thee
to
keep
she
said
i
shall
give
it
thee
gladly
for
fain
shall
i
be
of
thy
praise
when
thou
knowest
my
careful
keeping
of
that
hope
of
the
earlier
days
so
she
took
his
hand
in
her
hand
and
they
went
their
ways
they
twain
till
they
came
to
the
treasure
of
the
guarded
chamber
of
gain
they
were
all
alone
with
its
riches
and
she
turned
the
key
in
the
gold
and
lifted
the
purple
and
the
silken
web
unrolled
and
lo
her
hands
and
her
bosom
the
shards
of
sigmund
sword
no
stained
its
edges
and
the
gems
of
the
ocean
hoard
were
as
bright
in
the
hilts
and
glorious
as
when
in
the
volsungs
hall
it
shone
in
the
eyes
of
the
and
flashed
from
the
shielded
wall
but
sigurd
smiled
upon
it
and
he
said
o
mother
of
kings
well
hast
thou
warded
the
for
a
mirror
of
many
things
and
a
hope
of
much
fulfilment
well
hast
thou
given
to
me
the
message
of
my
fathers
and
the
word
of
thing
to
be
trusty
hath
been
thy
warding
but
its
hour
is
over
now
these
shards
shall
be
knit
together
and
shall
hear
the
blow
then
she
felt
his
hands
about
her
as
he
took
the
fateful
sword
and
he
kissed
her
soft
and
sweetly
but
she
answered
never
a
word
but
swift
on
his
ways
went
sigurd
and
to
regin
house
he
came
where
the
master
stood
in
the
doorway
and
behind
him
leapt
the
flame
and
dark
he
looked
and
little
no
more
his
speech
was
sweet
no
words
on
his
lip
were
gathered
the
volsung
child
to
greet
till
he
took
the
sword
from
sigurd
and
the
shards
of
the
days
of
old
then
he
spake
will
nothing
serve
thee
save
this
blue
steel
and
cold
the
bane
of
thy
father
father
the
fate
of
all
his
kin
the
baleful
blade
i
fashioned
the
wrath
that
the
gods
would
win
then
answered
the
sigurd
if
thou
thy
craft
wilt
do
nought
save
these
shall
be
my
helper
true
so
regin
welded
together
the
shards
of
sigmund
sword
and
wrought
the
wrath
of
sigurd
whose
hilts
were
great
and
along
whose
edge
ran
a
living
flame
so
that
men
thought
it
like
sunlight
and
lightning
mingled
then
on
greyfell
with
the
wrath
girt
by
his
side
sigurd
rode
to
the
hall
of
gripir
who
told
him
of
deeds
to
be
and
of
the
fate
that
would
befall
him
in
no
wise
was
sigurd
troubled
but
smiled
as
a
happy
child
and
together
they
talked
of
the
deeds
of
the
kings
of
the
earth
of
the
wonders
of
heaven
and
of
the
queen
of
the
sea
and
sigurd
told
gripir
that
he
indeed
was
wise
above
all
men
but
for
himself
had
the
wrath
been
fashioned
and
he
was
ready
to
ride
to
the
glittering
heath
so
they
took
leave
of
one
another
and
as
the
sky
grew
in
the
west
and
the
birds
were
flying
homeward
sigurd
drew
near
to
regin
dwelling
rideth
to
the
glittering
again
on
the
morrow
morning
doth
sigurd
the
volsung
ride
and
regin
the
master
of
masters
is
faring
by
his
side
and
they
leave
the
dwelling
of
kings
and
ride
the
summer
land
until
at
the
eve
of
the
day
the
hills
are
on
either
hand
then
they
wend
up
higher
and
higher
and
over
the
heaths
they
fare
till
the
moon
shines
broad
on
the
midnight
and
they
sleep
the
heavens
bare
and
they
waken
and
look
behind
them
and
lo
the
dawning
of
day
and
the
little
land
of
the
helper
and
its
valleys
far
away
but
the
mountains
rise
before
them
a
wall
exceeding
great
then
spake
the
master
of
masters
we
have
come
to
the
garth
and
the
gate
there
is
youth
and
rest
behind
thee
and
many
a
thing
to
do
there
is
many
a
fond
desire
and
each
day
born
anew
and
the
land
of
the
volsungs
to
conquer
and
many
a
people
praise
and
for
me
there
is
rest
it
may
be
and
the
peaceful
end
of
days
we
have
come
to
the
garth
and
the
gate
to
the
now
shall
we
win
shall
we
go
to
look
on
the
and
see
what
sitteth
therein
yea
and
what
else
said
sigurd
was
thy
tale
but
mockeries
and
have
i
been
drifted
hither
on
a
wind
of
empty
lies
it
was
sooth
it
was
sooth
said
regin
and
more
might
i
have
told
had
i
heart
and
space
to
remember
the
deeds
of
the
days
of
old
they
fared
through
the
mountains
and
that
highway
fashioner
forsooth
was
a
fearful
craftsman
and
his
hands
the
waters
were
and
the
ice
was
his
mattock
and
the
was
his
man
and
never
a
whit
he
heeded
though
his
walls
were
waste
and
wan
and
the
of
that
wayside
great
heaps
of
the
ashes
spent
but
each
as
a
man
alone
through
the
day
they
went
and
they
rode
till
the
moon
rose
upward
and
the
stars
were
small
and
fair
then
they
slept
on
the
ashes
beneath
the
heavens
bare
and
the
cold
dawn
came
and
they
wakened
and
the
king
of
the
seemed
as
a
thing
of
that
wan
land
fashioned
but
sigurd
glowed
and
gleamed
amid
a
shadowless
twilight
by
greyfell
cloudy
flank
as
a
little
space
they
abided
while
the
latest
shrank
on
the
backward
road
looked
regin
and
heard
how
sigurd
drew
the
girths
of
greyfell
saddle
and
the
voice
of
his
sword
he
knew
and
his
clanged
and
tinkled
as
he
leapt
to
the
and
the
sun
rose
up
at
their
backs
and
the
grey
world
changed
to
red
and
away
to
the
west
went
sigurd
by
the
glory
wreathed
about
but
little
and
black
was
regin
as
a
fire
that
dieth
out
they
rode
the
mountains
by
the
crags
exceeding
old
and
the
ash
that
the
first
of
the
found
dull
and
quenched
and
cold
then
the
moon
in
the
swam
and
the
stars
were
fair
and
pale
and
beneath
the
naked
heaven
they
slept
in
an
dale
and
again
at
the
ending
they
stood
upon
their
feet
and
sigurd
donned
his
nor
his
eyes
would
regin
meet
a
clear
streak
widened
in
heaven
low
down
above
the
earth
and
above
it
lay
the
and
the
sun
anigh
its
birth
unseen
their
hosts
was
staining
with
the
very
hue
of
blood
and
ruddy
by
greyfell
shoulder
the
son
of
sigmund
stood
then
spake
the
master
of
masters
what
is
thine
hope
this
morn
that
thou
dightest
thee
o
sigurd
to
ride
this
world
forlorn
what
needeth
hope
said
sigurd
when
the
heart
of
the
volsungs
turns
to
the
light
of
the
glittering
heath
and
the
house
where
the
waster
burns
i
shall
slay
the
foe
of
the
gods
as
thou
badst
me
a
while
agone
and
then
with
the
gold
and
its
wisdom
shalt
thou
be
left
alone
o
child
said
the
king
of
the
when
the
day
at
last
comes
round
for
the
dread
and
the
dusk
of
the
gods
and
the
kin
of
the
wolf
is
unbound
when
thy
sword
shall
hew
the
fire
and
the
wildfire
beateth
thy
shield
shalt
thou
praise
the
wages
of
hope
and
the
gods
that
pitched
the
field
o
foe
of
the
gods
said
sigurd
wouldst
thou
hide
the
evil
thing
and
the
curse
that
is
greater
than
thou
lest
death
end
thy
labouring
lest
the
night
should
come
upon
thee
amidst
thy
toil
for
nought
it
is
me
it
is
me
that
thou
fearest
if
indeed
i
know
thy
thought
yea
me
who
would
utterly
light
the
face
of
all
good
and
ill
if
not
with
the
fruitful
beams
that
the
summer
shall
fulfill
then
at
least
with
the
world
and
the
glare
of
the
grinded
sword
i
have
hearkened
not
nor
heeded
the
words
of
thy
fear
and
thy
ruth
thou
hast
told
thy
tale
and
thy
longing
and
thereto
i
hearkened
well
let
it
lead
thee
up
to
heaven
let
it
lead
thee
down
to
hell
the
deed
shall
be
done
tomorrow
thou
shalt
have
that
measureless
gold
and
devour
the
garnered
wisdom
that
blessed
thy
realm
of
old
that
hath
lain
unspent
and
begrudged
in
the
very
heart
of
hate
with
the
blood
and
the
might
of
thy
brother
thine
hunger
shalt
thou
sate
and
this
deed
shall
be
mine
and
thine
but
take
heed
for
what
followeth
then
let
each
do
after
his
kind
i
shall
do
the
deeds
of
men
i
shall
harvest
the
field
of
their
sowing
in
the
bed
of
their
strewing
shall
sleep
to
them
shall
i
give
my
to
the
gods
my
glory
to
keep
but
them
with
the
wealth
and
the
wisdom
that
the
best
of
the
gods
might
praise
if
thou
shall
indeed
excel
them
and
become
the
hope
of
the
days
then
me
in
turn
hast
thou
conquered
and
i
shall
be
in
turn
thy
fashioned
brand
of
the
battle
through
good
and
evil
to
burn
or
the
flame
that
sleeps
in
thy
stithy
for
the
gathered
winds
to
blow
when
thou
listest
to
do
and
undo
and
thine
uttermost
cunning
to
show
but
indeed
i
wot
full
surely
that
thou
shalt
follow
thy
kind
and
for
all
that
cometh
after
the
norns
shall
loose
and
bind
then
his
rang
sweetly
and
the
of
death
and
regin
drew
up
to
him
and
the
wrath
sang
loud
in
the
sheath
and
forth
from
that
trench
in
the
mountains
by
the
westward
way
they
ride
and
little
and
black
goes
regin
by
the
golden
volsung
side
so
ever
they
wended
upward
and
the
midnight
hour
was
and
the
stars
grew
pale
and
paler
and
failed
from
the
heaven
floor
and
the
moon
was
a
long
while
dead
but
where
was
the
promise
of
day
no
change
came
over
the
darkness
no
streak
of
the
dawning
grey
no
sound
of
the
wind
uprising
adown
the
night
there
ran
it
was
blind
as
the
gaping
gulf
ere
the
first
of
the
worlds
began
then
athwart
and
athwart
rode
sigurd
and
sought
the
walls
of
the
pass
but
found
no
wall
before
him
and
the
road
rang
hard
as
brass
beneath
the
hoofs
of
greyfell
as
up
and
up
he
trod
was
it
the
daylight
of
hell
or
the
night
of
the
doorway
of
god
but
lo
at
the
last
a
glimmer
and
a
light
from
the
west
there
came
and
another
and
another
like
points
of
flame
and
they
grew
and
brightened
and
gathered
and
whiles
together
they
ran
like
the
moonwake
over
the
waters
and
whiles
they
were
scant
and
wan
some
greater
and
some
lesser
like
the
boats
of
fishers
laid
about
the
sea
of
midnight
and
a
dusky
dawn
they
made
a
faint
and
glimmering
twilight
so
sigurd
strains
his
eyes
and
he
sees
how
a
land
deserted
all
round
about
him
lies
more
changeless
than
as
fruitless
as
its
floor
then
the
heart
leaps
up
within
him
for
he
knows
that
his
journey
is
and
there
he
draweth
bridle
on
the
first
of
the
glittering
heath
and
the
wrath
is
waxen
merry
and
sings
in
the
golden
sheath
as
he
leaps
adown
from
greyfell
and
stands
upon
his
feet
and
wends
his
ways
through
the
twilight
the
foe
of
the
gods
to
meet
slayeth
fafnir
the
nought
sigurd
seeth
of
regin
and
nought
he
heeds
of
him
as
in
watchful
might
and
glory
he
strides
the
desert
dim
and
behind
him
paceth
greyfell
but
he
deems
the
time
till
he
meet
the
great
the
of
wrong
so
he
wendeth
midst
the
silence
through
the
measureless
desert
place
and
beholds
the
countless
glitter
with
wise
and
steadfast
face
till
in
a
little
season
that
the
flames
grown
somewhat
wan
and
a
grey
thing
glimmers
before
him
and
becomes
a
mighty
man
and
in
raiment
clad
a
friendly
man
and
glorious
and
of
visage
then
content
in
sigurd
groweth
because
of
his
majesty
and
he
heareth
him
speak
in
the
desert
as
the
wind
of
the
winter
sea
hail
sigurd
give
me
thy
greeting
ere
thy
ways
alone
thou
wend
said
sigurd
hail
i
greet
thee
my
friend
and
my
fathers
friend
now
whither
away
said
the
elder
with
the
steed
and
the
ancient
sword
to
the
greedy
house
said
sigurd
and
the
king
of
the
heavy
hoard
wilt
thou
smite
o
sigurd
sigurd
said
the
ancient
yea
yea
i
shall
smite
said
the
volsung
save
the
gods
have
slain
the
sun
what
wise
wilt
thou
smite
said
the
elder
lest
the
dark
devour
thy
day
thou
hast
praised
the
sword
said
the
child
and
the
sword
shall
find
a
way
be
learned
of
me
said
the
for
i
was
the
first
of
thy
folk
said
the
child
i
shall
do
thy
bidding
and
for
thee
shall
i
strike
the
stroke
spake
the
thus
shalt
thou
do
when
thou
wendest
hence
alone
thou
shalt
find
a
path
in
the
desert
and
a
road
in
the
world
of
stone
it
is
smooth
and
deep
and
hollow
but
the
rain
hath
riven
it
not
and
the
wild
wind
hath
not
worn
it
for
it
is
but
fafnir
slot
whereby
he
wends
to
the
water
and
the
fathomless
pool
of
old
when
his
heart
in
the
dawn
is
weary
and
he
loathes
the
ancient
gold
there
think
of
the
great
and
the
fathers
and
bare
the
whetted
wrath
and
dig
a
pit
in
the
highway
and
a
grave
in
the
serpent
path
lie
thou
therein
o
sigurd
and
thine
hope
from
the
glooming
hide
and
be
as
the
dead
for
a
season
and
the
living
light
abide
and
so
shall
thine
heart
avail
thee
and
thy
mighty
fateful
hand
and
the
light
that
lay
in
the
branstock
the
brand
said
the
child
i
shall
do
thy
bidding
and
for
thee
shall
i
strike
the
stroke
for
i
love
thee
friend
of
my
fathers
wise
heart
of
the
holy
folk
so
spake
the
son
of
sigmund
and
beheld
no
man
anear
and
again
was
the
night
the
midnight
and
the
twinkling
flame
shone
clear
in
the
hush
of
the
glittering
heath
and
alone
went
sigmund
son
till
he
came
to
the
road
of
fafnir
and
the
highway
worn
by
one
by
the
drift
of
the
rain
unfurrowed
by
the
windy
years
unrent
and
forth
from
the
dark
it
came
and
into
the
dark
it
went
great
then
was
the
heart
of
sigurd
for
there
in
the
midmost
he
stayed
and
thought
of
the
ancient
fathers
and
bared
the
bright
blue
blade
that
shone
as
a
fleck
of
the
and
the
night
was
all
around
fair
then
was
the
son
of
sigmund
as
he
toiled
and
laboured
the
ground
great
mighty
he
was
in
his
working
and
the
glittering
heath
he
clave
and
the
sword
shone
blue
before
him
as
he
dug
the
pit
and
the
grave
there
he
hid
his
hope
from
the
and
lay
like
one
of
the
dead
and
wise
and
wary
he
bided
and
the
heavens
hung
over
his
head
now
the
night
wanes
over
sigurd
and
the
ruddy
rings
he
sees
and
his
fair
adornment
and
the
images
but
a
voice
in
the
desert
ariseth
a
sound
in
the
waste
has
birth
a
changing
tinkle
and
clatter
as
of
gold
dragged
over
the
earth
sigurd
widens
the
and
the
sound
is
drawing
close
and
speedier
than
the
trample
of
speedy
feet
it
goes
but
ever
deemeth
sigurd
that
the
sun
brings
back
the
day
for
the
grave
grows
lighter
and
lighter
and
heaven
is
grey
but
now
how
the
rattling
waxeth
till
he
may
not
heed
nor
hark
and
the
day
and
the
heavens
are
hidden
and
sigurd
rolls
the
dark
as
the
flood
of
a
pitchy
river
and
is
the
air
with
the
venom
of
hate
long
hoarded
and
lies
once
fashioned
fair
then
a
wan
face
comes
from
the
darkness
and
is
wrought
in
wise
and
the
lips
are
writhed
with
laughter
and
bleared
are
the
blinded
eyes
and
it
wandereth
hither
and
thither
and
searcheth
through
the
grave
and
departeth
leaving
nothing
save
the
dark
rolled
wave
on
wave
the
golden
head
of
sigurd
and
the
edges
of
the
sword
and
the
world
weighs
heavy
on
sigurd
and
the
weary
curse
of
the
hoard
the
grave
grew
straiter
and
his
hope
of
life
grew
chill
and
his
heart
by
the
worm
was
enfolded
and
the
bonds
of
the
ancient
then
was
sigurd
stirred
by
his
glory
and
he
strove
with
the
swaddling
of
death
he
turned
in
the
pit
on
the
highway
and
the
grave
of
the
glittering
heath
he
laughed
and
smote
with
the
laughter
and
thrust
up
over
his
head
and
smote
the
venom
asunder
and
clave
the
heart
of
dread
then
he
leapt
from
the
pit
and
the
grave
and
the
rushing
river
of
blood
and
fulfilled
with
the
joy
of
the
on
the
face
of
earth
he
stood
with
red
sword
high
uplifted
with
wrathful
glittering
eyes
and
he
laughed
at
the
heavens
above
him
for
he
saw
the
sun
arise
and
sigurd
gleamed
on
the
desert
and
shone
in
the
light
and
the
wind
in
his
raiment
wavered
and
all
the
world
was
bright
but
there
was
the
ancient
fafnir
and
the
face
of
terror
lay
on
the
huddled
folds
of
the
serpent
that
were
black
and
in
the
desert
lit
by
the
sun
and
those
twain
looked
each
on
each
and
forth
from
the
face
of
terror
went
a
sound
of
dreadful
speech
child
child
who
art
thou
that
hast
smitten
bright
child
of
whence
is
thy
birth
i
am
called
the
glorious
and
alone
i
wend
on
the
earth
what
master
hath
taught
thee
of
murder
thou
hast
wasted
fafnir
day
i
sigurd
knew
and
desired
and
the
bright
sword
learned
the
way
i
am
blind
o
strong
compeller
in
the
bonds
of
death
and
hell
but
thee
shall
the
rattling
gold
and
the
red
rings
bring
unto
bane
yet
the
rings
mine
hand
shall
scatter
and
the
earth
shall
gather
again
woe
woe
in
the
days
passed
over
i
bore
the
helm
of
dread
i
reared
the
face
of
terror
and
the
hoarded
hate
of
the
dead
i
overcame
and
was
mighty
i
was
wise
and
cherished
my
heart
in
the
waste
where
no
man
wandered
and
the
high
house
builded
apart
till
i
met
thine
hand
o
sigurd
and
thy
might
ordained
from
of
old
and
i
fought
and
fell
in
the
morning
and
i
die
far
off
from
the
gold
then
all
sank
into
silence
and
the
son
of
sigmund
stood
on
the
torn
and
furrowed
desert
by
the
pool
of
fafnir
blood
and
the
serpent
lay
before
him
dead
chilly
dull
and
grey
and
over
the
glittering
heath
fair
shone
the
sun
and
the
day
and
a
light
wind
followed
the
sun
and
breathed
the
fateful
place
as
fresh
as
it
furrows
the
or
bows
the
acres
face
slayeth
regin
the
master
of
masters
on
the
glittering
there
standeth
sigurd
the
volsung
and
leaneth
on
his
sword
and
beside
him
now
is
greyfell
and
looks
on
his
golden
lord
and
the
world
is
awake
and
living
and
whither
now
shall
they
wend
who
have
come
to
the
glittering
heath
and
wrought
that
deed
to
its
end
for
hither
comes
regin
the
master
from
the
skirts
of
the
field
of
death
afoot
he
went
the
desert
and
he
came
unto
sigurd
and
stared
at
the
golden
gear
of
the
man
and
the
wrath
yet
bloody
and
bared
and
the
light
locks
raised
by
the
wind
and
the
eyes
beginning
to
smile
and
the
lovely
lips
of
the
volsung
and
the
brow
that
knew
no
guile
and
he
murmured
under
his
breath
while
his
eyes
grew
white
with
wrath
o
who
art
thou
and
wherefore
and
why
art
thou
in
the
path
then
he
turned
to
the
serpent
and
grovelled
low
on
the
ground
and
he
drank
of
that
pool
of
the
blood
where
the
stones
of
the
wild
were
drowned
and
long
he
lapped
as
a
dog
but
when
he
arose
again
lo
a
flock
of
the
that
drew
to
the
feastful
plain
and
he
turned
and
looked
on
sigurd
as
bright
in
the
sun
he
stood
a
stripling
fair
and
slender
and
wiped
the
wrath
of
the
blood
then
he
scowled
and
crouched
and
darkened
and
came
to
sigurd
and
spake
o
child
thou
hast
slain
my
brother
and
the
wrath
is
alive
and
awake
thou
sayest
sooth
said
sigurd
thy
deed
and
mine
is
done
but
now
our
ways
shall
sunder
for
here
meseemeth
the
sun
hath
but
little
of
deeds
to
do
and
no
love
to
win
aback
but
regin
darkened
before
him
and
exceeding
grim
was
he
grown
and
he
spake
thou
hast
slain
my
brother
and
wherewith
wilt
thou
atone
stand
up
o
master
said
sigurd
o
singer
of
ancient
days
and
take
the
wealth
i
have
won
thee
ere
we
wend
on
the
sundering
ways
i
have
toiled
and
thou
hast
desired
and
the
treasure
is
surely
anear
and
thou
hast
wisdom
to
find
it
and
i
have
slain
thy
fear
but
regin
crouched
and
darkened
thou
hast
slain
my
brother
he
said
take
thou
the
gold
quoth
sigurd
for
the
ransom
of
my
head
then
regin
crouched
and
darkened
and
over
the
earth
he
hung
and
he
said
thou
hast
slain
my
brother
and
the
gods
are
yet
but
young
and
he
spake
thou
hast
slain
my
brother
and
today
shall
thou
be
my
thrall
yea
a
king
shall
be
my
and
this
heath
my
then
he
crept
to
the
coils
where
the
life
of
his
brother
had
lain
and
he
drew
a
glaive
from
his
side
and
smote
the
smitten
and
slain
and
tore
the
heart
from
fafnir
while
the
eagles
cried
and
sharp
and
shrill
was
their
voice
the
entrails
of
the
dead
then
regin
spake
to
sigurd
of
this
slaying
wilt
thou
be
free
then
gather
thou
fire
together
and
roast
the
heart
for
me
that
i
may
eat
it
and
live
and
be
thy
master
and
more
for
therein
was
might
and
wisdom
and
the
grudged
and
hoarded
lore
or
else
depart
on
thy
ways
afraid
from
the
glittering
heath
then
he
fell
abackward
and
slept
nor
set
his
sword
in
the
sheath
but
sigurd
took
the
heart
and
wood
on
the
waste
he
found
the
wood
that
grew
and
died
as
it
crept
on
the
niggard
ground
and
grew
and
died
again
and
lay
like
whitened
bones
and
the
ernes
cried
over
his
head
as
he
builded
his
hearth
of
stones
and
kindled
the
fire
for
cooking
and
sat
and
sang
the
roast
the
song
of
his
fathers
of
old
and
the
wolflings
gathering
host
so
there
on
the
glittering
heath
rose
up
the
little
flame
and
the
dry
sticks
crackled
amidst
it
and
alow
the
eagles
came
and
seven
they
were
by
tale
and
they
pitched
all
round
about
the
of
sigurd
and
sent
their
out
but
nought
he
knoweth
its
wisdom
or
the
word
that
they
would
speak
and
hot
grew
the
heart
of
fafnir
and
sang
amid
the
reek
then
sigurd
looketh
on
regin
and
he
deemeth
it
overlong
that
he
dighteth
the
morsel
and
the
might
for
the
master
of
wrong
so
he
reacheth
his
hand
to
the
roast
to
see
if
the
cooking
be
but
the
blood
and
the
fat
seethed
from
it
and
scalded
his
finger
sore
and
he
set
his
hand
to
his
mouth
to
quench
the
fleshly
smart
and
he
tasted
the
flesh
of
the
serpent
and
the
blood
of
fafnir
heart
then
there
came
a
change
upon
him
for
the
speech
of
fowl
he
knew
and
wise
in
the
ways
of
the
as
the
dwarfs
of
old
he
grew
and
he
knitted
his
brows
and
hearkened
and
wrath
in
his
heart
arose
for
he
felt
beset
of
evil
in
a
world
of
many
foes
but
the
hilts
of
the
wrath
he
handled
and
regin
heart
he
saw
and
how
that
the
foe
of
the
gods
the
net
of
death
would
draw
and
his
bright
eyes
flashed
and
sparkled
and
his
mouth
grew
set
and
stern
as
he
hearkened
the
voice
of
the
eagles
and
their
song
began
to
learn
and
six
of
the
eagles
cried
to
sigurd
not
to
tarry
before
the
feast
and
they
urged
him
to
kill
regin
who
had
planned
fafnir
death
that
he
alone
might
live
and
fashion
the
world
after
his
evil
will
and
the
seventh
arise
o
sigurd
lest
the
hour
be
overlate
for
the
sun
in
the
shineth
and
swift
is
the
hand
of
fate
arise
lest
the
world
run
backward
and
the
blind
heart
have
its
will
and
once
again
be
tangled
the
sundered
good
and
ill
lest
love
and
hatred
perish
lest
the
world
forget
its
tale
and
the
gods
sit
deedless
dreaming
in
the
heavenly
vale
then
swift
ariseth
sigurd
and
the
wrath
in
his
hand
is
bare
and
he
looketh
and
regin
sleepeth
and
his
eyes
glare
but
his
lips
smile
false
in
his
dreaming
and
his
hand
is
on
the
sword
for
he
dreams
himself
the
master
and
the
new
world
and
his
dream
hath
forgotten
sigurd
and
the
king
life
lies
in
the
pit
he
is
nought
death
gnaweth
upon
him
while
the
dwarfs
in
mastery
sit
but
lo
how
the
eyes
of
sigurd
the
heart
of
the
guileful
behold
and
great
is
allfather
odin
and
upriseth
the
curse
of
the
gold
and
the
branstock
bloometh
to
heaven
from
the
ancient
wondrous
root
the
summer
hath
shone
on
its
blossoms
and
sigurd
wrath
is
the
fruit
then
his
second
stroke
struck
sigurd
for
the
wrath
flashed
thin
and
white
and
head
and
trunk
of
regin
fierce
ran
the
fateful
light
and
there
lay
brother
by
brother
a
faded
thing
and
wan
but
sigurd
cried
in
the
desert
so
far
have
i
wended
on
dead
are
the
foes
of
that
would
blend
the
good
and
the
ill
and
the
world
shall
yet
be
famous
and
the
gods
shall
have
their
will
nor
shall
i
be
dead
and
forgotten
while
the
earth
grows
worse
and
worse
with
the
blind
heart
king
the
people
and
binding
curse
with
curse
sigurd
took
to
him
the
treasure
of
the
elf
so
sigurd
ate
of
the
heart
of
fafnir
and
as
he
ate
the
longing
to
be
gone
to
mighty
deeds
grew
great
and
he
leapt
on
greyfell
and
sought
the
home
of
the
dweller
amid
the
gold
on
the
edge
of
the
heath
he
strode
through
the
doorway
and
before
him
lay
golden
armour
golden
coins
and
golden
sands
from
rivers
that
none
but
the
dwarfs
could
mine
but
more
wonderful
than
all
other
treasures
were
the
helm
of
aweing
and
the
hauberk
all
of
gold
while
on
top
of
the
midmost
heap
gleaming
like
the
brightest
star
in
the
sky
lay
the
ring
of
andvari
sigurd
put
on
the
helm
and
the
hauberk
and
dragged
out
gold
wherewith
he
loaded
greyfell
till
the
horse
shone
while
the
eagles
ever
bade
him
bring
forth
the
treasure
and
let
the
gold
shine
in
the
open
and
as
the
stars
paled
and
the
dawn
grew
clearer
sigurd
and
greyfell
passed
swiftly
and
lightly
towards
the
west
sigurd
awoke
brynhild
upon
by
long
roads
rideth
sigurd
amidst
that
world
of
stone
and
somewhat
south
he
turneth
for
he
would
not
be
alone
but
longs
for
the
dwellings
of
and
the
kingly
people
speech
and
the
days
of
the
glee
and
the
joyance
where
men
laugh
each
to
each
but
still
the
desert
endureth
and
afar
must
greyfell
fare
from
the
wrack
of
the
glittering
heath
and
fafnir
golden
lair
long
sigurd
rideth
the
waste
when
lo
on
a
morning
of
day
from
out
of
the
tangled
amidst
the
grey
comes
up
a
mighty
mountain
and
it
is
as
though
there
burns
a
torch
amidst
of
its
so
thither
sigurd
turns
for
he
deems
indeed
from
its
topmost
to
look
on
the
best
of
the
earth
and
greyfell
neigheth
beneath
him
and
his
heart
is
full
of
mirth
night
falls
but
yet
rides
sigurd
and
hath
no
thought
of
rest
for
he
longs
to
climb
that
and
behold
the
earth
at
its
best
but
now
mid
the
maze
of
the
he
seeth
the
light
no
more
and
the
stars
are
lovely
and
gleaming
on
the
lightless
heavenly
floor
so
up
and
up
he
wendeth
till
the
night
is
wearing
thin
and
he
rideth
a
rift
of
the
mountain
and
all
is
dark
therein
till
the
stars
are
dimmed
by
dawning
and
the
wakening
world
is
cold
then
afar
in
the
upper
a
breach
doth
he
behold
and
a
flood
of
light
poured
inward
the
doubtful
dawning
blinds
so
swift
he
rideth
thither
and
the
mouth
of
the
breach
he
finds
and
sitteth
awhile
on
greyfell
on
the
marvellous
thing
to
gaze
for
lo
the
side
of
hindfell
enwrapped
by
the
fervent
blaze
and
nought
earth
and
heaven
save
a
world
of
flickering
flame
and
a
hurrying
shifting
tangle
where
the
dark
rents
went
and
came
great
groweth
the
heart
of
sigurd
with
uttermost
desire
and
he
crieth
kind
to
greyfell
and
they
hasten
up
and
nigher
till
he
draweth
rein
in
the
dawning
on
the
face
of
hindfell
steep
but
who
shall
heed
the
dawning
where
the
tongues
of
that
wildfire
leap
for
they
weave
a
wavering
wall
that
driveth
over
the
heaven
the
wind
that
is
born
within
it
nor
ever
aside
is
it
driven
by
the
mightiest
wind
of
the
waste
and
the
amidst
it
is
nought
and
no
wayfarer
door
and
no
window
the
hand
of
its
builder
hath
wrought
but
thereon
is
the
volsung
smiling
as
its
breath
uplifteth
his
hair
and
his
eyes
shine
bright
with
its
image
and
his
mail
gleams
white
and
fair
and
his
pictures
the
heavens
and
the
waning
stars
behind
but
his
neck
is
greyfell
stretching
to
snuff
at
the
blind
and
his
cloudy
flank
upheaveth
and
tinkleth
the
knitted
mail
and
the
gold
of
the
uttermost
waters
is
waxen
wan
and
pale
now
sigurd
turns
in
his
saddle
and
the
hilt
of
the
wrath
he
shifts
and
draws
a
girth
the
tighter
then
the
gathered
reins
he
lifts
and
crieth
aloud
to
greyfell
and
rides
at
the
wildfire
heart
but
the
white
wall
wavers
before
him
and
the
rusheth
apart
and
high
his
head
it
riseth
and
wide
and
wild
is
its
roar
as
it
beareth
the
mighty
tidings
to
the
very
heavenly
floor
but
he
rideth
through
its
roaring
as
the
warrior
rides
the
rye
when
it
bows
with
the
wind
of
the
summer
and
the
hid
spears
draw
anigh
the
white
flame
licks
his
raiment
and
sweeps
through
greyfell
mane
and
bathes
both
hands
of
sigurd
and
the
hilts
of
fafnir
bane
and
winds
about
his
and
mingles
with
his
hair
but
nought
his
raiment
dusketh
or
dims
his
glittering
gear
then
it
fails
and
fades
and
darkens
till
all
seems
left
behind
and
dawn
and
the
blaze
is
swallowed
in
stark
and
blind
but
forth
a
little
further
and
a
little
further
on
and
all
is
calm
about
him
and
he
sees
the
scorched
earth
wan
beneath
a
glimmering
twilight
and
he
turns
his
conquering
eyes
and
a
ring
of
pale
slaked
ashes
on
the
side
of
hindfell
lies
and
the
world
of
the
waste
is
beyond
it
and
all
is
hushed
and
grey
and
the
moon
is
and
the
stars
grow
faint
with
day
then
sigurd
looked
before
him
and
a
there
he
saw
a
wall
of
the
tiles
of
odin
wrought
clear
without
a
flaw
the
gold
by
the
silver
gleaming
and
the
ruddy
by
the
white
and
the
blazonings
of
their
glory
were
done
upon
them
bright
as
of
dear
things
wrought
for
the
new
come
to
odin
hall
piled
high
aloft
to
the
heavens
uprose
that
and
far
the
topmost
for
a
banner
of
fame
there
hung
a
glorious
golden
buckler
and
against
the
staff
it
rung
as
the
earliest
wind
of
dawning
uprose
on
hindfell
face
and
the
light
from
the
yellow
east
beamed
soft
on
the
shielded
place
but
the
wrath
cried
out
in
answer
as
sigurd
leapt
adown
to
the
wasted
soil
of
the
desert
by
that
rampart
of
renown
he
looked
but
little
beneath
it
and
the
dwelling
of
god
it
seemed
as
against
its
gleaming
silence
the
eager
sigurd
gleamed
he
draweth
not
sword
from
scabbard
as
the
wall
he
wendeth
around
and
it
is
but
the
wind
and
sigurd
that
wakeneth
any
sound
but
lo
to
the
gate
he
cometh
and
the
doors
are
open
wide
and
no
warder
the
way
withstandeth
and
no
earls
by
the
threshold
abide
so
he
stands
awhile
and
marvels
then
the
baleful
light
of
the
wrath
gleams
bare
in
his
ready
hand
as
he
wendeth
the
inward
path
for
he
doubteth
some
guile
of
the
gods
or
perchance
some
snare
or
a
mock
of
the
giant
people
that
shall
fade
in
the
morning
air
but
he
getteth
him
in
and
gazeth
and
a
wall
doth
he
behold
and
the
ruddy
set
by
the
white
and
the
silver
by
the
gold
but
within
the
garth
that
it
girdeth
no
work
of
man
is
set
but
the
utmost
head
of
hindfell
ariseth
higher
yet
and
below
in
the
very
midmost
is
a
mound
piled
high
as
the
rims
of
the
above
the
level
ground
and
there
on
that
mound
of
the
giants
the
wilderness
forlorn
a
pale
grey
image
lieth
and
gleameth
in
the
morn
so
there
was
sigurd
alone
and
he
went
from
the
shielded
door
and
aloft
in
the
desert
of
wonder
the
light
of
the
branstock
he
bore
and
he
set
his
face
to
the
and
beheld
the
image
wan
and
the
dawn
was
growing
about
it
and
lo
the
shape
of
a
man
set
forth
to
the
eyeless
desert
on
the
of
the
world
high
over
the
castle
whence
the
windy
bolts
are
hurled
now
over
the
body
he
standeth
and
seeth
it
shapen
fair
and
clad
from
head
to
in
pale
gear
in
a
hauberk
wrought
as
straitly
as
though
to
the
flesh
it
were
grown
but
a
great
helm
hideth
the
head
and
is
girt
with
a
glittering
crown
so
thereby
he
stoopeth
and
kneeleth
for
he
deems
it
were
good
indeed
if
the
breath
of
life
abide
there
and
the
speech
to
help
at
need
and
as
sweet
as
the
summer
wind
from
a
garden
under
the
sun
cometh
forth
on
the
topmost
hindfell
the
breath
of
that
then
he
saith
he
will
look
on
the
face
if
it
bear
him
love
or
hate
or
the
bonds
for
his
life
constraining
or
the
sundering
doom
of
fate
so
he
draweth
the
helm
from
the
head
and
lo
the
brow
and
the
smooth
unfurrowed
cheeks
and
the
wise
lips
breathing
light
and
the
face
of
a
woman
it
is
and
the
fairest
that
ever
was
born
shown
forth
to
the
empty
heavens
and
the
desert
world
forlorn
but
he
looketh
and
loveth
her
sore
and
he
longeth
her
spirit
to
move
and
awaken
her
heart
to
the
world
that
she
may
behold
him
and
love
and
he
toucheth
her
breast
and
her
hands
and
he
loveth
her
passing
sore
and
he
saith
awake
i
am
sigurd
but
she
moveth
never
the
more
then
he
looked
on
his
bare
bright
blade
and
he
said
thou
what
wilt
thou
do
for
indeed
as
i
came
by
the
thy
voice
of
desire
i
knew
bright
burnt
the
pale
blue
edges
for
the
sunrise
drew
anear
and
the
rims
of
the
glittered
and
the
east
was
exceeding
clear
so
the
eager
edges
he
setteth
to
the
where
the
hammered
collar
constraineth
the
woman
throat
but
the
sharp
wrath
biteth
and
rendeth
and
before
it
fail
the
rings
and
lo
the
gleam
of
the
linen
and
the
light
of
golden
things
then
he
driveth
the
blue
steel
onward
and
through
the
skirt
and
out
till
nought
but
the
rippling
linen
is
wrapping
her
about
then
he
deems
her
breath
comes
quicker
and
her
breast
begins
to
heave
so
he
turns
about
the
and
rends
down
either
sleeve
till
her
arms
lie
white
in
her
raiment
and
a
river
of
hair
flows
free
bosom
and
shoulder
and
floods
the
desert
bare
then
a
flush
cometh
over
her
visage
and
a
sigh
her
breast
and
her
eyelids
quiver
and
open
and
she
wakeneth
into
rest
on
the
dawning
she
gazeth
too
glad
to
change
or
smile
and
but
little
moveth
her
body
nor
speaketh
she
yet
for
a
while
and
yet
kneels
sigurd
moveless
her
wakening
speech
to
heed
while
soft
the
waves
of
the
daylight
the
starless
heavens
speed
and
the
gleaming
rims
of
the
yet
bright
and
brighter
grow
and
the
thin
moon
hangeth
her
horns
in
the
golden
glow
then
she
turned
and
gazed
on
sigurd
and
her
eyes
met
the
volsung
eyes
and
mighty
and
measureless
now
did
the
tide
of
his
love
arise
for
their
longing
had
met
and
mingled
and
he
knew
of
her
heart
that
she
loved
as
she
spake
unto
nothing
but
him
and
her
lips
with
the
moved
o
what
is
the
thing
so
mighty
that
my
weary
sleep
hath
torn
and
rent
the
fallow
bondage
and
the
wan
woe
he
said
the
hand
of
sigurd
and
the
sword
of
sigmund
son
and
the
heart
that
the
volsungs
fashioned
this
deed
for
thee
have
done
but
she
said
where
then
is
odin
that
laid
me
here
alow
long
lasteth
the
grief
of
the
world
and
manfolk
tangled
woe
he
dwelleth
above
said
sigurd
but
i
on
the
earth
abide
and
i
came
from
the
glittering
heath
the
waves
of
thy
fire
to
ride
then
sigurd
looketh
upon
her
and
the
words
from
his
heart
arise
thou
art
the
fairest
of
earth
and
the
wisest
of
the
wise
o
who
art
thou
that
lovest
i
am
sigurd
as
i
told
i
have
slain
the
foe
of
the
gods
and
gotten
the
ancient
gold
and
great
were
the
gain
of
thy
love
and
the
gift
of
mine
earthly
days
if
we
twain
should
never
sunder
as
we
wend
on
the
changing
ways
o
who
art
thou
that
lovest
thou
fairest
of
all
things
born
and
what
meaneth
thy
sleep
and
thy
slumber
in
the
wilderness
forlorn
then
the
maiden
told
him
that
she
had
been
the
handmaid
of
the
but
that
she
grew
too
proud
and
odin
had
sent
her
to
hindfell
where
the
sleep
thorn
pierced
her
that
she
might
sleep
till
she
found
the
fearless
heart
she
would
wed
such
a
one
had
she
found
now
and
many
were
the
words
of
prophetic
wisdom
and
warning
that
fell
from
her
lips
on
the
ears
of
sigurd
but
many
though
they
were
they
were
not
enough
for
him
who
prayed
her
to
speak
with
him
more
of
wisdom
so
together
they
sat
on
the
side
of
hindfell
and
talked
of
all
that
is
and
can
be
and
then
together
they
climbed
the
mountain
till
beneath
them
they
saw
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
stretching
far
away
and
brynhild
bade
him
look
down
on
her
home
saying
yet
i
bid
thee
look
on
the
land
the
wood
and
the
silver
sea
in
the
bight
of
the
swirling
river

cherished

he
set

brynhild
and
sigurd
left
hindfell
and
brynhild
went
to
dwell
in
her
sister
house
but
sigurd
abode
not
long
in
the
land
of
lymdale
for
his
love
urged
him
to
great
adventures
wherein
he
might
win
glory
befitting
the
man
who
should
wed
so
noble
a
woman
as
brynhild
so
it
befell
one
day
in
summer
that
he
dight
himself
in
the
helm
of
aweing
and
the
all
of
gold
and
girded
the
wrath
to
his
side
to
ride
forth
again
and
on
his
saddle
he
bound
the
red
rings
of
fafnir
treasure
then
he
kissed
the
ancient
king
heimir
and
hailed
the
folk
of
the
land
who
came
to
give
him
and
he
gathered
the
reins
together
and
set
his
face
to
the
road
and
the
glad
steed
neighed
beneath
him
as
they
fared
from
the
king
abode
and
out
past
the
dewy
closes
but
the
shouts
went
up
to
the
sky
though
some
for
very
sorrow
forbore
the
farewell
cry
nor
was
any
man
but
heavy
that
the
godlike
guest
should
go
and
they
craved
for
that
glad
heart
guileless
and
that
face
without
a
foe

of

away

rides
a
heath
unpeopled
and

the
westward
way
till
a
long
way
off
before
him

up
the
mountains
grey
grey
huge
beyond
all
telling
and
the
host
of
the
heaped
clouds
the

and
the
white

had
hid

grey
huge
blacker
they
showed
than
aforetime
white
hung
the
there
but
red
was
the
cloudy
crown
for
the
sun
was
sinking
fair
a
wide
plain
lay
beneath
him
and
a
river
through
it
wound
betwixt
the
lea
and
the
acres
and
the
misty
orchard
ground
but
forth
from
the
feet
of
the
mountains
a
ridged
hill
there
ran
that
upreared
at
its
hithermost
ending
a
builded
burg
of
man
and
sigurd
deemed
in
his
heart
as
he
looked
on
the
burg
from
afar
that
the
high
gods
scarce
might
win
it
if
thereon
they
fell
with
war
so
many
and
great
were
the
walls
so
bore
the
towers
on
high
the
threat
of
guarded
battle
and
the
tale
of
victory
for
as
waves
on
the
iron
river
of
the
days
whereof
nothing
is
told
stood
up
the
many
towers
so
stark
and
sharp
and
cold
but
and
worn
and
ancient
as
the
midmost
is
the
wall
that
goeth
about
them
and
its
mighty
compass
hides
full
many
a
dwelling
of
man
whence
the
reek
now
goeth
aloft
and
the
voice
of
the
the
sharp
sounds
blent
with
the
soft
but
one
house
in
the
midst
is
unhidden
and
high
up
the
wall
it
goes
aloft
in
the
wind
of
the
mountains
its
golden
glows
and
down
mid
its
buttressed
feet
is
the
wind
voice
never
still
and
the
day
and
the
night
pass
it
and
it
changes
to
their
will
and
whiles
is
it
glassy
and
dark
and
whiles
is
it
white
and
dead
and
whiles
is
it
grey
as
the
and
whiles
is
it
angry
red
and
it
shimmers
under
the
sunshine
and
grows
black
to
the
threat
of
the
storm
and
dusk
its
gold
roof
glimmers
when
the
over
it
swarm
and
bright
in
the
first
of
the
morning
its
flame
doth
it
uplift
when
the
light
clouds
rend
before
it
and
along
its
furrows
drift
then
sigurd
heart
was
glad
as
he
beheld
the
city
and
after
a
while
he
came
to
a
set
in
the
northern
wall
and
the
gate
was
long
and
dark
as
a
but
no
man
stayed
him
as
he
rode
through
the
dusk
to
the
inner
and
saw
the
lofty
roof
of
the
hall
before
him
cold
now
and
grey
like
a
very
cloud
for
the
sun
was
fully
set
but
in
the
towers
were
calling
one
to
another
to
them
he
cried
saying
ho
men
of
this
mighty
burg
to
what
folk
of
the
world
am
i
come
and
who
is
the
king
of
battles
who
dwells
in
this
lordly
home
or
perchance
are
ye
of
the
are
ye
kind
at
the
board
or
and
destroyers
to
gain
and
die
by
the
sword
then
the
spears
in
the
forecourt
glittered
and
the
swords
shone
over
the
wall
but
the
song
of
smitten
came
faint
from
the
cloudy
hall
and
he
hearkened
a
voice
and
a
crying
the
house
of
giuki
the
king
and
the
burg
of
the
niblung
people
and
the
heart
of
their
warfaring
there
were
many
men
about
him
and
the
wind
in
the
sang
and
the
spears
of
the
niblungs
glittered
and
the
swords
in
the
forecourt
rang
but
they
looked
on
his
face
in
the
even
and
they
hushed
their
voices
and
gazed
for
fear
and
great
desire
the
hearts
of
men
amazed
now
cometh
an
earl
to
king
giuki
as
he
sits
in
godlike
wise
with
his
sons
the
kings
of
battle
and
his
wife
of
the
glittering
eyes
and
the
king
cries
out
at
his
coming
to
tell
why
the
blew
but
the
earl
saith
lord
of
the
people
choose
now
what
thou
wilt
do
for
here
is
a
strange
and
he
saith
to
thee
alone
will
he
tell
of
his
name
and
his
kindred
and
the
deeds
that
his
hand
hath
done
then
uprose
the
king
of
the
niblungs
and
was
clad
in
purple
and
pall
and
his
sheathed
sword
lay
in
his
hand
as
he
gat
him
adown
the
hall
and
abroad
through
the
niblung
doorway
and
a
mighty
man
he
was
and
wise
and
ancient
of
days
so
there
by
the
earls
doth
he
pass
and
beholdeth
the
king
on
the
and
looketh
up
in
his
face
but
sigurd
smileth
upon
him
in
the
niblungs
fenced
place
as
the
king
saith
who
into
our
garth
wouldst
ride
wilt
thou
tell
thy
name
to
a
king
who
biddeth
thee
here
abide
and
have
all
good
at
our
hands
for
unto
the
niblungs
home
and
the
heart
of
a
people
from
the
weary
road
are
ye
come
and
i
am
giuki
the
king
so
now
if
thou
thee
a
god
look
not
to
see
me
tremble
for
i
know
of
such
that
have
trod
unfeared
in
the
burg
of
the
niblungs
nor
worser
nor
better
at
all
may
fare
the
folk
of
the
gods
than
the
kings
in
giuki
hall
so
i
bid
thee
abide
in
my
house
and
when
many
days
are
thou
shalt
tell
us
at
last
of
thine
errand
if
thou
bear
us
peace
or
war
then
all
rejoiced
at
his
word
till
the
swords
on
the
bucklers
rang
and
adown
from
the
treasure
the
son
of
sigmund
sprang
and
he
took
the
hand
of
giuki
and
kissed
him
soft
and
sweet
and
spake
hail
ancient
of
days
for
thou
biddest
me
things
most
meet
and
thou
knowest
the
good
from
the
evil
few
days
are
over
and
gone
since
my
father
was
old
in
the
world
ere
the
deed
of
my
making
was
won
but
sigmund
the
volsung
he
was
full
ripe
of
years
and
of
fame
and
i
who
have
never
beheld
him
am
sigurd
called
of
name
too
young
in
the
world
am
i
waxen
that
a
tale
thereof
should
be
told
and
yet
have
i
slain
the
serpent
and
gotten
the
ancient
gold
and
broken
the
bonds
of
the
weary
and
ridden
the
wavering
fire
but
short
is
mine
errand
to
tell
and
the
end
of
my
desire
for
peace
i
bear
unto
thee
and
to
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
who
bear
the
sword
aright
and
are
crowned
with
the
crown
of
worth
but
unpeace
to
the
lords
of
evil
and
the
battle
and
the
death
and
the
edge
of
the
sword
to
the
traitor
and
the
flame
to
the
slanderous
breath
and
i
would
that
the
loving
were
loved
and
i
would
that
the
weary
should
sleep
and
that
man
should
hearken
to
man
and
that
he
that
soweth
should
reap
now
wide
in
the
world
would
i
fare
to
seek
the
dwellings
of
kings
for
with
them
would
i
do
and
undo
and
be
heart
of
their
warfarings
so
i
thank
thee
lord
for
thy
bidding
and
here
in
thine
house
will
i
bide
and
learn
of
thine
ancient
wisdom
till
forth
to
the
field
we
ride
glad
then
was
the
murmur
of
folk
for
the
tidings
had
gone
forth
and
its
breath
had
been
borne
to
the
niblungs
and
the
tale
of
worth
but
the
king
said
welcome
sigurd
full
fair
of
deed
and
of
word
and
here
mayst
thou
win
thee
fellows
for
the
days
of
the
peace
and
the
sword
for
not
lone
in
the
world
have
i
lived
but
sons
from
my
loins
have
sprung
whose
deeds
with
the
rhyme
are
mingled
and
their
names
with
the
tongue
then
he
took
his
hand
in
his
hand
and
into
the
hall
they
passed
and
great
shouts
of
salutation
to
the
cloudy
roof
were
cast
and
they
rang
from
the
glassy
pillars
and
the
gods
on
the
hangings
stirred
and
afar
the
clustering
eagles
on
the
golden
heard
and
cried
out
on
the
sword
of
the
branstock
as
they
cried
in
the
other
days
then
the
harps
rang
out
in
the
hall
and
men
sang
in
sigurd
praise
but
now
on
the
dais
he
meeteth
the
kin
of
giuki
the
wise
lo
here
is
the
crowned
grimhild
the
queen
of
the
glittering
eyes
lo
here
is
the
goodly
gunnar
with
the
face
of
a
king
desire
lo
here
is
hogni
that
holdeth
the
wisdom
tried
in
the
fire
lo
here
is
guttorm
the
youngest
who
longs
for
the
meeting
swords
lo
here
as
a
rose
in
the
amid
the
niblung
lords
is
the
maid
of
the
niblungs
standing
the
giuki
child
and
all
these
looked
long
on
sigurd
and
their
hearts
upon
him
smiled
then
all
gave
him
greeting
as
one
who
should
be
their
fellow
in
mighty
deeds
and
the
gudrun
giuki
daughter
brought
him
a
cup
of
welcome
and
that
night
the
niblungs
feasted
in
gladness
of
heart
sigurd
warfaring
in
the
company
of
the
niblungs
and
of
his
great
fame
and
so
sigurd
abode
with
the
niblungs
all
through
summer
and
harvest
time
till
with
the
stark
midwinter
came
tidings
of
war
then
the
earls
of
giuki
donned
dusky
hauberks
and
led
forth
their
bands
from
the
fortress
and
the
fair
face
and
golden
gear
of
sigurd
shone
among
those
warriors
they
fell
on
the
cities
of
the
plains
but
none
might
resist
the
valour
of
sigurd
and
the
niblungs
turned
in
triumph
from
the
war
bringing
rich
spoil
so
all
that
winter
sigurd
fared
to
war
with
them
and
grew
greater
in
glory
and
more
beloved
of
all
men
but
ever
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
turned
to
lymdale
and
to
brynhild
who
awaited
him
there
now
sheathed
is
the
wrath
of
sigurd
for
as
wax
withstands
the
flame
so
the
kings
of
the
land
withstood
him
and
the
glory
of
his
fame
and
before
the
grass
is
growing
or
the
kine
have
fared
from
the
stall
the
song
of
the
goes
up
in
the
niblung
hall
and
they
sing
of
the
golden
sigurd
and
the
face
without
a
foe
and
the
lowly
man
exalted
and
the
mighty
brought
alow
and
they
say
when
the
sun
of
summer
shall
come
aback
to
the
land
it
shall
shine
on
the
fields
of
the
tiller
that
fears
no
heavy
hand
that
the
sheaf
shall
be
for
the
plougher
and
the
loaf
for
him
that
sowed
through
every
furrowed
acre
where
the
son
of
sigmund
rode
full
dear
was
sigurd
the
volsung
to
all
men
most
and
least
and
now
as
the
spring
drew
onward
was
deemed
a
goodly
feast
for
the
children
by
the
niblung
burg
to
wait
if
perchance
the
son
of
sigmund
should
ride
abroad
by
the
gate
for
whosoever
feared
him
no
forsooth
would
shrink
from
the
shining
eyes
and
the
hand
that
clave
out
truth
from
the
heart
of
the
wrack
and
the
battle
it
was
then
as
his
gold
gear
burned
the
balks
of
the
bridge
and
the
river
that
oft
the
mother
turned
and
spake
to
the
laughing
baby
o
little
son
and
dear
when
i
from
the
world
am
departed
and
whiles
ye
hear
the
best
of
longing
for
the
least
of
sigurd
days
thou
shalt
hearken
to
their
story
till
they
tell
forth
all
his
praise
and
become
beloved
and
a
wonder
as
thou
sayest
when
all
is
sung
i
too
once
beheld
him
in
the
days
when
i
was
young
yea
they
sing
the
song
of
sigurd
and
the
face
without
a
foe
and
they
sing
of
the
prison
rending
and
the
tyrant
laid
alow
and
the
golden
thieves
abasement
and
the
stilling
of
the
churl
and
the
mocking
of
the
dastard
where
the
chasing
edges
whirl
and
they
sing
of
the
outland
maidens
that
thronged
round
sigurd
hand
and
sung
in
the
streets
of
the
foemen
of
the
land
and
they
tell
how
the
ships
of
the
merchants
come
free
and
go
at
their
will
and
how
wives
in
peace
and
safety
may
crop
the
hill
how
the
maiden
sits
in
her
bower
and
the
weaver
sings
at
his
loom
and
forget
the
kings
of
grasping
and
the
greedy
days
of
gloom
for
by
sea
and
hill
and
township
hath
the
son
of
sigmund
been
and
looked
on
the
folk
unheeded
and
the
lowly
people
seen
but
he
stood
in
the
sight
of
the
people
and
sweet
he
was
to
see
and
no
foe
and
no
betrayer
and
no
envier
now
hath
he
but
gunnar
the
bright
in
the
battle
deems
him
his
earthly
friend
and
hogni
is
fain
of
his
fellow
howso
the
day
work
end
and
guttorm
the
young
is
joyous
of
the
help
and
gifts
he
hath
and
all
these
would
shine
beside
him
in
the
glory
of
his
path
there
is
none
to
hate
or
hinder
or
mar
the
golden
day
and
the
light
of
love
flows
plenteous
as
the
hide
the
way
the
cup
of
evil
drink
that
grimhild
the
gave
to
now
gudrun
the
daughter
of
giuki
beheld
sigurd
glory
and
knew
the
kindness
of
his
heart
and
set
her
love
on
him
not
knowing
that
all
his
thoughts
were
given
to
brynhild
so
sigurd
seeing
her
sad
and
in
no
wise
guessing
the
cause
of
her
grief
strove
to
comfort
her
with
kindly
words
but
her
mood
was
still
unchanged
then
grimhild
the
queen
who
was
a
and
a
woman
of
crafty
mind
marked
the
love
of
gudrun
for
sigurd
and
marked
moreover
how
his
power
and
honour
in
the
land
would
soon
be
greater
than
that
of
her
own
sons
therefore
she
cast
about
for
some
shift
that
might
bind
sigurd
to
serve
with
the
niblungs
all
his
now
it
befell
one
night
that
sigurd
had
returned
from
warring
and
sat
on
the
to
sup
with
the
niblung
kings
his
heart
was
merry
with
victory
and
ever
he
thought
of
hindfell
and
of
lymdale
and
the
love
of
brynhild
the
people
waxed
joyful
and
the
hangings
whereon
glowed
figures
of
the
gods
were
stirred
with
their
song
and
shouting
till
giuki
called
on
sigurd
to
take
the
harp
and
sing
of
deeds
agone
then
all
men
hearkened
hushed
and
happy
while
sigurd
struck
the
strings
and
sang
of
his
mighty
kin
of
volsung
of
signy
and
of
sigmund
their
deeds
and
noble
deaths
at
last
the
tale
was
ended
and
he
fell
silent
thinking
still
of
brynhild
now
came
grimhild
bearing
him
a
cup
of
wine
and
speaking
fair
words
of
praise
but
in
the
wine
she
had
mingled
a
fatal
so
she
stood
by
sigurd
and
said
there
is
none
of
the
kings
of
kingdoms
that
may
match
thy
goodlihead
lo
now
thou
hast
sung
of
thy
fathers
but
men
shall
sing
of
thee
and
therewith
shall
our
house
be
remembered
and
great
shall
our
glory
be
i
beseech
thee
hearken
a
little
to
a
faithful
word
of
mine
when
thou
of
this
cup
hast
drunken
for
my
love
is
blent
with
the
wine
he
laughed
and
took
the
cup
but
therein
with
the
blood
of
the
earth
earth
hidden
might
was
mingled
and
deeds
of
the
cold
sea
birth
and
things
that
the
high
gods
turn
from
and
a
tangle
of
strange
love
deep
guile
and
strong
compelling
that
whoso
drank
thereof
should
remember
not
his
longing
should
cast
his
love
away
remembering
dead
desire
but
as
night
remembereth
day
so
sigurd
looked
on
the
horn
and
he
saw
how
fair
it
was
scored
with
the
cunning
of
the
and
the
masters
of
the
sword
and
he
drank
and
smiled
on
grimhild
above
the
beaker
rim
and
she
looked
and
laughed
at
his
laughter
and
the
soul
was
changed
in
him
men
gazed
and
their
hearts
sank
in
them
and
they
knew
not
why
it
was
why
the
hall
was
darkling
nor
what
had
come
to
pass
for
they
saw
the
sorrow
of
sigurd
who
had
seen
but
his
deeds
erewhile
and
the
face
of
the
mighty
darkened
who
had
known
but
the
light
of
its
smile
but
grimhild
looked
and
was
merry
and
she
deemed
her
life
was
great
and
her
hand
a
wonder
of
wonders
to
withstand
the
deeds
of
fate
for
she
saw
by
the
face
of
sigurd
and
the
token
of
his
eyes
that
her
will
had
abased
the
valiant
and
filled
the
faithful
with
lies
but
the
heart
was
changed
in
sigurd
as
though
it
had
been
his
love
of
brynhild
perished
as
he
gazed
on
the
niblung
queen
brynhild
beloved
body
was
as
a
wasted
hearth
no
more
for
bale
or
blessing
for
plenty
or
for
dearth
o
ye
that
shall
look
hereafter
when
the
day
of
sigurd
is
done
and
the
last
of
his
deeds
is
accomplished
and
his
eyes
are
shut
in
the
sun
when
ye
look
and
long
for
sigurd
and
the
image
of
sigurd
behold
and
his
white
sword
still
as
the
moon
and
his
strong
hand
heavy
and
cold
then
perchance
shall
ye
think
of
this
even
then
perchance
shall
ye
wonder
and
cry
twice
over
king
are
we
smitten
and
twice
have
we
seen
thee
die
men
say
that
a
little
after
the
evil
of
that
night
all
waste
is
the
burg
of
brynhild
and
there
springeth
a
marvellous
light
on
the
desert
hard
by
lymdale
and
few
men
know
for
why
but
there
are
who
say
that
a
wildfire
thence
roareth
up
to
the
sky
round
a
glorious
golden
dwelling
wherein
there
sitteth
a
queen
in
remembrance
of
the
wakening
and
the
slumber
that
hath
been
wherein
a
maid
there
sitteth
who
knows
not
hope
nor
rest
for
remembrance
of
the
mighty
and
the
best
come
forth
from
the
best
now
after
sigurd
took
the
came
a
great
hush
upon
the
for
a
space
but
grimhild
was
fain
of
that
hour
and
cried
to
the
scalds
for
music
and
they
hastened
to
strike
the
harp
but
no
joy
mingled
with
the
sounds
and
no
man
was
moved
to
singing
no
word
spake
sigurd
till
the
feast
was
over
then
he
strode
out
alone
from
the
hall
and
the
folk
fell
back
before
him
so
he
took
a
steed
and
all
that
night
he
rode
alone
in
the
deedless
dark
and
all
the
morrow
very
heavy
at
heart
yet
knowing
no
cause
for
grief
and
remembering
all
things
save
brynhild
at
last
he
came
again
at
sunset
to
the
niblung
gates
and
there
came
forth
giuki
and
grimhild
and
the
niblung
brethren
with
fair
words
of
greeting
but
in
the
doorway
gudrun
stood
and
wept
so
sigurd
entered
with
them
yet
he
knew
that
a
flood
of
sorrow
had
come
on
his
and
that
no
more
might
he
feel
the
joy
he
had
known
aforetime
in
the
niblung
hall
howbeit
when
he
looked
on
the
people
and
saw
them
in
fear
at
his
trouble
the
kindness
of
his
heart
was
kindled
and
thrusting
the
heavy
sorrow
aside
he
lifted
his
head
and
spake
wise
words
of
good
cheer
so
that
the
folk
looking
on
him
were
comforted
the
wedding
of
sigurd
the
but
gudrun
knew
sigurd
heart
and
was
sorrowful
because
of
his
grief
and
her
great
love
for
him
and
when
grimhild
bade
her
carry
him
wine
she
arose
and
took
the
cup
but
could
find
no
word
to
speak
for
anguish
and
sigurd
looking
on
her
face
saw
there
a
kindness
and
a
sorrow
like
his
own
and
seeing
it
he
knew
that
she
loved
him
then
pity
and
love
for
her
rose
in
his
heart
and
comforted
him
and
he
took
the
cup
from
her
and
spake
saying
here
are
glad
men
about
us
and
a
joyous
folk
of
war
and
they
that
have
loved
thee
for
long
and
they
that
have
cherished
mine
heart
but
we
twain
alone
are
woeful
as
sad
folk
sitting
apart
ah
if
i
thy
soul
might
gladden
if
thy
lips
might
give
me
peace
then
belike
were
we
gladdest
of
all
for
i
love
thee
more
than
these
the
cup
of
goodwill
that
thou
bearest
and
the
greeting
thou
wouldst
say
turn
these
to
the
cup
of
thy
love
and
the
words
of
the
day
the
love
that
endureth
for
ever
and
the
troth
to
face
the
norns
undoing
and
the
gods
amid
their
wrath
and
his
clear
voice
saith
o
gudrun
now
hearken
while
i
swear
that
the
sun
shall
die
for
ever
and
the
day
no
more
be
fair
ere
i
forget
thy
pity
and
thine
inmost
heart
of
love
yea
though
the
kings
be
mighty
and
the
gods
be
great
above
i
will
wade
the
flood
and
the
fire
and
the
waste
of
war
forlorn
to
look
on
the
niblung
dwelling
and
the
house
where
thou
wert
born
strange
seemed
the
words
to
sigurd
that
his
gathering
love
compelled
and
sweet
and
strange
desire
his
tangled
trouble
welled
but
bright
flashed
the
eyes
of
gudrun
and
she
said
king
as
for
me
if
thou
sawest
the
heart
in
my
bosom
what
oath
might
better
thee
yet
my
words
thy
words
shall
cherish
as
thy
lips
my
lips
have
done
herewith
i
swear
o
sigurd
that
the
earth
shall
hate
the
sun
and
the
year
desire
but
darkness
and
the
blossoms
shrink
from
day
ere
my
love
shall
fail
beloved
or
my
longing
pass
away
so
they
twain
went
hand
in
hand
to
stand
before
giuki
and
grimhild
and
the
niblung
brethren
and
all
these
were
when
they
marked
their
joy
and
goodlihead
then
sigurd
spake
noble
words
of
thanks
to
giuki
for
all
past
kindness
and
bade
giuki
call
him
son
because
he
had
that
day
bidden
gudrun
to
wife
and
he
sware
also
to
toil
for
her
exalting
and
for
the
weal
of
all
the
niblung
kin
thereto
giuki
answered
hail
sigurd
son
of
mine
eld
and
called
upon
grimhild
the
queen
to
bless
him
thus
was
sigurd
to
the
gudrun
and
all
men
were
fain
of
their
love
and
spake
nought
but
praise
of
him
hark
now
on
the
morrow
morning
how
the
blast
of
the
mighty
horn
from
the
builded
burg
of
the
niblungs
goes
over
the
acres
shorn
and
the
roads
are
gay
with
the
riders
and
the
bull
in
the
stall
is
left
and
the
plough
is
alone
in
the
furrow
and
the
wedge
in
the
hole
and
late
shall
the
ewes
be
folded
and
the
kine
come
home
to
the
pail
and
late
shall
the
fires
be
litten
in
the
outmost
treeless
dale
for
men
fare
to
the
gate
of
giuki
and
the
ancient
cloudy
hall
and
therein
are
the
earls
assembled
and
the
kings
wear
purple
and
pall
and
the
flowers
are
spread
beneath
them
and
the
beaten
with
gold
and
the
walls
are
strange
and
wondrous
with
the
noble
stories
told
for
is
the
ancient
dwelling
with
the
golden
spoils
of
the
south
and
men
seem
merry
for
ever
and
the
praise
is
in
each
man
mouth
and
the
name
of
sigurd
the
volsung
the
king
and
the
serpent
bane
who
exalteth
the
high
this
morning
and
blesseth
the
masters
of
gain
for
men
drink
the
bridal
of
sigurd
and
the
niblung
maid
and
the
best
with
the
best
shall
be
mingled
and
the
gold
with
the
gold
so
fair
in
the
hall
is
the
feasting
and
men
hearts
are
uplifted
on
high
and
they
deem
that
the
best
of
their
are
surely
drawing
anigh
as
now
one
after
other
uprise
the
scalds
renowned
and
their
voices
awake
the
sound
in
the
midmost
of
the
and
the
joy
of
feasting
lords
then
cometh
a
hush
and
a
waiting
and
the
light
of
many
swords
flows
into
the
hall
of
giuki
by
the
doorway
of
the
king
and
amid
those
flames
of
battle
the
warriors
bring
the
cup
of
daring
promise
and
the
hallowed
boar
of
son
and
men
hearts
grow
big
with
longing
and
great
is
the
grown
for
bright
the
son
of
sigmund
ariseth
by
the
board
and
unwinds
the
knitted
that
hamper
regin
sword
then
fierce
is
the
light
on
the
as
men
set
down
the
cup
anigh
the
hand
of
sigurd
and
the
edges
blue
rise
up
and
fall
on
the
hallowed
as
a
trump
of
the
woeful
war
rings
the
voice
of
the
mighty
volsung
as
he
speaks
the
words
of
yore
by
the
earth
that
groweth
and
giveth
and
by
all
the
earth
increase
that
is
spent
for
gods
and
by
the
sun
that
shines
on
these
by
the
that
beareth
the
life
and
death
of
men
by
the
heavens
and
stars
that
change
not
though

things
of

and
lone
by
the

goths
in

and
the
holy

of

i

me
to

for

be

i

in

of

of

though
the
anguish
past

and
the
unheard
woe
have
birth
and
i

to
wend
in
my
sorrow
that
none
shall
curse
mine
eyes
for
the
scowl
that
quelleth
beseeching
and
the
hate
that
scorneth
the

so
help
me
earth
and
heavens
and
the
and

and
the
stars
in
their
ordered
houses
and
the
norns
that
order
these
and
he
drank
of
the
cup
of
the
promise
and
fair
as
a
star
he
shone
and
all
men
rejoiced
and
wondered
and
deemed
earth
glory
won
then
came
the
girded
maidens
and
the
slim
earls
daughters
poured
and
uprose
the
gunnar
and
bare
was
the
niblung
sword
blue
it
gleamed
in
the
hand
of
the
as
he
laid
it
low
on
the
beast
and
took
oath
as
the
goths
of
aforetime
in
the
hush
of
the
people
feast
i
will
work
for
the
craving
of
kings
and
accomplish
the
will
of
the
great
nor
ask
what
god
withstandeth
nor
hearken
the
tales
of
fate
when
a
king
my
life
hath
exalted
and
wrought
for
my
hope
and
my
gain
for
every
deed
he
hath
done
me
thereto
shall
i
fashion
twain
i
shall
bear
forth
the
fame
of
the
niblungs
through
all
that
hindereth
in
my
life
shall
i
win
great
glory
and
be
merry
in
my
death
so
sweareth
the
lovely
and
drinketh
of
the
cup
and
the
joy
of
the
people
waxeth
and
their
glad
cry
goeth
up
but
again
came
the
girded
maidens
earls
daughters
pour
the
wine
and
bare
is
the
blade
of
hogni
in
the
over
the
swine
then
he
cries
the
hallowed
earth
hearken
how
i
swear
to
beseech
no
man
for
his
helping
and
to
vex
no
god
with
prayer
and
to
seek
out
the
will
of
the
norns
and
look
in
the
eyes
of
the
curse
and
to
laugh
while
the
love
aboundeth
lest
the
glad
world
grow
into
worse
then
if
in
the
murder
i
laugh
not
o
earth
remember
my
name
and
oft
tell
it
aloud
to
the
people
for
the
niblungs
fated
shame
then
he
drank
of
the
cup
of
the
promise
and
all
men
hearkened
and
deemed
that
his
speech
was
great
and
valiant
and
as
one
of
the
wise
he
seemed
then
the
maidens
of
the
lift
the
gold
but
the
earls
look
each
on
the
other
and
guttorm
place
behold
and
empty
it
lieth
before
them
for
the
child
hath
wearied
of
peace
and
he
sits
by
the
oars
in
the
and
winneth
fame
increase
nor
then
nor
ever
after
the
holy
beast
he
spake
when
mighty
hearts
were
exalted
for
the
golden
sigurd
sake
rideth
with
the
niblungs
and
wooeth
brynhild
for
king
now
it
fell
on
a
day
of
the
that
followed
on
these
things
that
sigurd
fares
to
the
meadows
with
gunnar
and
hogni
the
kings
for
afar
is
guttorm
the
youngest
and
he
sails
the
eastern
seas
and
fares
with
hoisted
to
win
him
fame
increase
there
stay
those
kings
of
the
people
alone
in
weed
of
war
and
they
cut
a
strip
of
the
greensward
on
the
meadow
daisied
floor
and
loosen
it
clean
in
the
midst
while
its
ends
in
the
earth
abide
then
they
heave
its
midmost
aloft
and
set
on
either
side
an
ancient
spear
of
battle
writ
round
with
words
of
worth
and
these
are
the
posts
of
the
door
whose
threshold
is
of
the
earth
and
the
skin
of
the
earth
is
its
lintel
but
with
gleaming
bare
the
niblung
kings
and
sigurd
beneath
the
fare
then
each
an
openeth
and
their
blended
blood
falls
down
on
earth
the
fruitful
mother
where
they
rent
her
turfy
gown
and
then
when
the
blood
of
the
volsungs
hath
run
with
the
niblung
blood
they
kneel
with
their
hands
upon
it
and
swear
the
brotherhood
each
man
at
his
brother
bidding
to
come
with
the
blade
in
his
hand
though
the
fire
and
the
flood
should
sunder
and
the
very
gods
withstand
each
man
to
love
and
cherish
his
brother
hope
and
will
each
man
to
avenge
his
brother
when
the
norns
his
fate
fulfill
and
now
are
they
and
in
such
wise
have
they
sworn
as
the
goths
of
aforetime
when
the
world
was
newly
born
but
among
the
folk
of
the
niblungs
goes
forth
the
tale
of
the
same
and
men
deem
the
tidings
a
glory
and
the
garland
of
their
fame
so
is
sigurd
yet
with
the
niblungs
and
he
loveth
gudrun
his
wife
and
wendeth
afield
with
the
brethren
to
the
days
of
the
dooming
of
life
and
nought
his
glory
waneth
nor
falleth
the
flood
of
praise
to
every
man
he
hearkeneth
nor
gainsayeth
any
grace
and
glad
is
the
poor
in
the
when
he
seeth
his
face
mid
the
kings
for
the
tangle
straighteneth
before
him
and
the
maze
of
crooked
things
but
the
smile
is
departed
from
him
and
the
laugh
of
sigurd
the
young
and
of
few
words
now
is
he
waxen
and
his
songs
are
seldom
sung
howbeit
of
all
the
was
sigurd
loved
the
best
and
men
say
is
the
king
heart
mighty
beyond
all
hope
of
rest
lo
how
he
beareth
the
people
how
heavy
their
woes
are
grown
so
oft
were
a
god
mid
the
if
he
dwelt
in
the
world
alone
now
giuki
the
king
was
long
grown
old
and
he
died
and
was
buried
beneath
a
great
high
on
the
mountains
so
there
lieth
giuki
the
king
mid
steel
and
the
glimmer
of
gold
as
the
sound
of
the
feastful
niblungs
round
his
misty
house
is
rolled
but
gunnar
is
king
of
the
people
and
the
chief
of
the
niblung
land
a
man
beloved
for
his
mercy
and
his
might
and
his
open
hand
a
glorious
king
in
the
battle
a
hearkener
at
the
doom
a
singer
to
sing
the
sun
up
from
the
heart
of
the
midnight
gloom
on
a
day
sit
the
kings
in
the
when
grimhild
saith
to
her
son
o
gunnar
king
beloved
a
fair
life
hast
thou
won
on
the
flood
in
the
field
hast
thou
wrought
and
hung
the
chambers
with
gold
far
abroad
mid
many
a
people
are
the
tidings
of
thee
told
now
do
a
deed
for
thy
mother
and
the
hallowed
niblung
hearth
lest
the
house
of
the
mighty
perish
and
our
tale
grow
wan
with
dearth
if
thou
do
the
deed
that
i
bid
thee
and
wed
a
wife
of
the
kings
no
less
shalt
thou
cleave
the
and
scatter
the
ruddy
rings
he
said
meseemeth
mother
thou
speakest
not
in
haste
but
hast
sought
and
found
beforehand
lest
thy
fair
words
fall
to
waste
she
said
thou
sayest
the
sooth
i
have
found
the
thing
i
sought
a
maid
for
thee
is
shapen
and
a
queen
for
thee
is
wrought
in
the
waste
land
hard
by
lymdale
a
marvellous
hall
is
built
with
its
roof
of
the
red
gold
beaten
and
its
afar
the
heath
men
see
it
but
no
man
draweth
nigher
for
the
garth
that
goeth
about
it
is
nought
but
the
roaring
fire
a
white
wall
waving
aloft
and
no
window
nor
wicket
is
there
whereby
the
shielded
or
the
sons
of
the
merchants
may
fare
but
few
things
from
me
are
hidden
and
i
know
in
that
hall
of
gold
sits
brynhild
white
as
a
where
the
foamless
seas
are
rolled
and
the
daughter
of
kings
of
the
world
and
the
sister
of
queens
is
she
and
wise
and
odin
chooser
and
the
breath
of
victory
but
for
this
cause
sitteth
she
thus
in
the
ring
of
the
wavering
flame
that
no
son
of
the
kings
will
she
wed
save
the
mightiest
master
of
fame
and
the
man
who
knoweth
not
fear
and
the
man
foredoomed
of
fate
to
ride
through
her
wavering
fire
to
the
door
of
her
golden
gate
and
for
him
she
sitteth
and
waiteth
and
him
shall
she
cherish
and
love
though
the
kings
of
the
world
should
withstand
it
and
the
gods
that
sit
above
speak
thou
o
mighty
gunnar
nay
rather
sigurd
my
son
say
who
but
the
lord
of
the
niblungs
should
wed
with
this
glorious
one
long
sigurd
gazeth
upon
her
and
slow
he
sayeth
again
i
know
thy
will
my
mother
of
all
the
sons
of
men
of
all
the
kings
unwedded
and
the
kindred
of
the
great
it
is
meet
that
my
brother
gunnar
should
ride
to
her
golden
gate
in
the
riseth
gunnar
with
fair
face
and
gleaming
eyes
and
he
calleth
on
sigurd
his
brother
and
he
calleth
on
hogni
the
wise
today
shall
we
fare
to
the
wooing
for
so
doth
our
mother
bid
we
shall
go
to
gaze
on
marvels
and
things
from
the
hid
so
they
do
on
the
best
of
their
and
their
steeds
are
dight
for
the
road
and
forth
to
the
sun
neigheth
greyfell
as
he
neighed
the
golden
load
but
or
ever
they
leap
to
the
saddle
while
yet
in
the
door
they
stand
thereto
cometh
grimhild
the
and
on
each
head
layeth
her
hand
as
she
saith
be
mighty
and
wise
as
the
kings
that
came
before
for
they
knew
of
the
ways
of
the
gods
and
the
craft
of
the
gods
they
bore
and
they
knew
how
the
shapes
of
are
the
very
images
of
the
hearts
that
abide
within
them
and
they
knew
of
the
shaping
of
these
be
wise
and
mighty
o
kings
and
look
in
mine
heart
and
behold
the
craft
that
prevaileth
semblance
and
the
treasured
wisdom
of
old
i
hallow
you
thus
for
the
day
and
i
hallow
you
thus
for
the
night
and
i
hallow
you
thus
for
the
dawning
with
my
fathers
hidden
might
go
now
for
ye
bear
my
will
while
i
sit
in
the
hall
and
spin
and
tonight
shall
be
the
weaving
and
tomorn
the
web
shall
ye
win
so
they
leap
to
the
saddles
aloft
and
they
ride
and
speak
no
word
but
the
hills
and
the
dales
are
awakened
by
the
clink
of
the
sheathed
sword
none
looks
in
the
face
of
the
other
but
the
earth
and
the
heavens
gaze
and
behold
those
kings
of
battle
ride
down
the
dusty
ways
so
they
come
to
the
waste
of
lymdale
when
the
afternoon
is
begun
and
afar
they
see
the
on
the
grey
sky
under
the
sun
and
they
spur
and
speak
no
word
and
no
man
to
his
fellow
will
turn
but
they
see
the
hills
draw
upward
and
the
earth
beginning
to
burn
and
they
ride
and
the
eve
is
coming
and
the
sun
hangs
low
the
earth
and
the
red
flame
roars
up
to
it
from
the
midst
of
the
desert
dearth
none
turns
or
speaks
to
his
brother
but
the
wrath
gleams
bare
and
red
and
is
the
helm
of
aweing
on
the
golden
sigurd
head
and
bare
is
the
blade
of
gunnar
and
the
first
of
the
three
he
rides
and
the
wavering
wall
is
before
him
and
the
golden
sun
it
hides
then
the
heart
of
a
king
son
failed
not
but
he
tossed
his
sword
on
high
and
laughed
as
he
spurred
for
the
fire
and
cried
the
niblung
cry
but
the
mare
son
saw
and
imagined
and
the
steed
that
so
oft
had
pierced
the
and
never
failed
at
need
shrank
back
and
shrieked
in
his
terror
and
spite
of
spur
and
rein
fled
fast
as
the
foals
unbitted
on
odin
pasturing
plain
wide
then
he
wheeled
with
gunnar
but
with
hand
and
knee
he
dealt
and
the
voice
of
a
lord
beloved
till
the
steed
his
master
felt
and
bore
him
back
to
the
brethren
by
greyfell
sigurd
stood
and
stared
at
the
heart
of
the
fire
and
his
helm
was
red
as
blood
but
hogni
sat
in
his
saddle
and
watched
the
flames
and
he
said
thy
steed
has
failed
thee
that
was
once
the
noblest
foal
in
the
pastures
of
king
giuki
but
since
thine
heart
fails
not
and
thou
wouldst
not
get
thee
backward
and
say
the
fire
was
hot
and
the
voices
pent
within
it
were
singing
nought
but
death
let
sigurd
lend
thee
his
steed
that
wore
the
glittering
heath
and
carried
the
bed
of
the
serpent
and
the
ancient
ruddy
rings
so
perchance
may
the
mocks
be
lesser
when
men
tell
of
the
niblung
kings
then
sigurd
looked
on
the
twain
and
he
saw
their
swart
hair
wave
in
the
wind
of
the
waste
and
the
and
no
answer
awhile
he
gave
but
at
last
he
spake
o
brother
on
greyfell
shalt
thou
ride
and
do
on
the
helm
of
aweing
and
gird
the
wrath
to
thy
side
and
cover
thy
breast
with
the
that
is
throughly
woven
of
gold
that
hath
not
its
like
in
the
heavens
nor
has
earth
of
its
fellow
told
for
this
is
the
raiment
of
kings
when
they
ride
the
flickering
fire
and
so
sink
the
flames
before
them
and
the
might
of
their
desire
then
hogni
laughed
in
his
heart
and
he
said
this
changing
were
well
if
so
might
the
deed
be
accomplished
but
perchance
there
is
more
to
tell
thou
shalt
take
the
gunnar
and
enough
or
nought
it
shall
be
but
the
gear
of
the
niblungs
the
golden
hall
shall
see
then
sigurd
looked
on
the
speaker
as
one
who
would
answer
again
but
his
words
died
out
on
the
waste
and
the
made
them
vain
then
he
casteth
the
reins
to
his
brother
and
gunnar
praiseth
his
gift
and
springeth
aloft
to
the
saddle
as
the
fair
sun
fails
from
the
lift
and
sigurd
looks
on
the
burden
that
greyfell
doth
uprear
the
huge
king
towering
upward
in
the
dusky
niblung
gear
there
sits
the
eager
gunnar
and
his
heart
desires
the
deed
and
of
nought
he
recketh
and
thinketh
but
a
warrior
need
but
greyfell
trembleth
nothing
and
nought
of
the
fire
doth
reck
then
the
spurs
in
his
flank
are
smitten
and
the
reins
lie
loose
on
his
neck
and
the
sharp
cry
springeth
from
gunnar
no
handbreadth
stirred
the
beast
the
dusk
drew
on
and
over
and
the
light
of
the
fire
increased
and
still
as
a
shard
on
the
mountain
in
the
sandy
dale
alone
was
the
shape
of
the
cloudy
greyfell
nor
moved
he
more
than
the
stone
but
right
through
the
heart
of
the
fire
for
ever
sigurd
stared
as
he
stood
in
the
gold
with
the
wrath
thin
edges
bared
no
word
for
a
while
spake
any
till
gunnar
leaped
to
the
earth
and
the
anger
wrought
within
him
and
the
fierce
words
came
to
birth
who
mocketh
the
king
of
the
niblungs
in
the
desert
land
forlorn
is
it
thou
o
sigurd
the
stranger
is
it
thou
o
dost
thou
laugh
in
the
hall
o
mother
dost
thou
spin
and
laugh
at
the
tale
that
has
drawn
thy
son
and
thine
eldest
to
the
sword
and
the
blaze
of
the
bale
or
thou
o
god
of
the
goths
wilt
thou
hide
and
laugh
thy
fill
while
the
hands
of
the
the
blood
of
brothers
spill
but
the
awful
voice
of
sigurd
across
the
wild
went
forth
how
changed
are
the
words
of
gunnar
where
wend
his
ways
of
worth
i
mock
thee
not
in
the
desert
as
i
mocked
thee
not
in
the
mead
when
i
swore
beneath
the
to
help
thy
fondest
need
nay
strengthen
thine
heart
for
the
work
for
the
gift
that
thy
manhood
awaits
for
i
give
thee
a
gift
o
niblung
that
shall
overload
the
fates
and
how
may
a
king
sustain
it
but
forbear
with
the
dark
to
strive
for
thy
mother
spinneth
and
worketh
and
her
craft
is
awake
and
alive
then
hogni
spake
from
the
saddle
the
time
and
the
time
is
come
to
gather
the
might
of
our
mother
and
of
her
that
spinneth
at
home
forbear
all
words
o
gunnar
and
anigh
to
sigurd
stand
and
face
to
face
behold
him
and
take
his
hand
in
thine
hand
then
be
thy
will
as
his
will
that
his
heart
may
mingle
with
thine
and
the
love
that
he
sware
the
with
thine
hope
may
intertwine
then
the
wrath
from
the
niblung
slippeth
and
the
shame
that
anger
hath
bred
and
the
heavy
wings
of
the
dreamtide
flit
over
gunnar
head
but
he
doth
by
his
brother
bidding
and
sigurd
hand
he
takes
and
he
looks
in
the
eyes
of
the
volsung
though
scarce
in
the
desert
he
wakes
there
hogni
sits
in
the
saddle
aloof
from
the
king
desire
and
little
his
lips
are
moving
as
he
stares
on
the
rolling
fire
and
mutters
the
spells
of
his
mother
and
the
words
she
bade
him
say
but
the
craft
of
the
kings
of
aforetime
on
those
kings
of
the
battle
lay
dark
night
was
spread
behind
them
and
the
fire
flared
up
before
and
unheard
was
the
wind
of
the
wasteland
mid
the
white
flame
wavering
roar
long
sigurd
gazeth
on
gunnar
till
he
sees
as
through
a
cloud
the
long
black
locks
of
the
niblung
and
the
king
face
set
and
proud
then
the
face
is
alone
on
the
dark
and
the
dusky
niblung
mail
is
nought
but
the
night
before
him
then
whiles
will
the
visage
fail
and
grow
again
as
he
gazeth
black
hair
and
gleaming
eyes
and
fade
again
into
nothing
as
for
more
of
vision
he
tries
then
all
is
nought
but
the
night
yea
the
waste
of
an
emptier
thing
and
the
sigurd
forgetteth
nor
feeleth
the
hand
of
the
king
nay
what
is
it
now
he
remembereth
it
is
nought
that
aforetime
he
knew
and
no
world
is
there
left
him
to
live
in
and
no
deed
to
rejoice
in
or
rue
but
frail
and
alone
he
fareth
and
as
one
in
the
drift
by
the
starless
empty
places
that
lie
beyond
the
lift
then
at
last
is
he
stayed
in
his
drifting
and
he
saith
it
is
blind
and
dark
yet
he
feeleth
the
earth
at
his
feet
and
there
cometh
a
change
and
a
spark
and
away
in
an
instant
of
time
is
the
mirk
of
the
dreamland
rolled
and
there
is
the
midnight
and
before
him
an
image
of
gold
a
man
in
the
raiment
of
gods
nor
fashioned
worser
than
they
full
sad
he
gazeth
on
sigurd
from
the
great
wide
eyes
and
grey
and
the
helm
that
aweth
the
people
is
set
on
the
golden
hair
and
the
mail
of
gold
enwraps
him
and
the
wrath
in
his
hand
is
bare
then
sigurd
looks
on
his
arm
and
his
hand
in
his
brother
hand
and
thereon
is
the
dark
grey
well
forged
in
the
southern
land
then
he
looks
on
the
sword
that
he
beareth
and
lo
the
eager
blade
that
leaps
in
the
hand
of
gunnar
when
the
kings
are
waxen
afraid
and
he
turns
his
face
his
shoulder
and
the
hang
down
from
the
helm
of
the
and
the
rings
of
the
niblung
crown
then
a
red
flush
riseth
against
him
in
the
face
seen
before
save
dimly
in
the
mirror
or
the
burnished
targe
of
war
and
the
sunder
and
the
clasped
hands
fall
apart
but
a
change
cometh
over
sigurd
and
the
fierce
pride
leaps
in
his
heart
he
knoweth
the
soul
of
gunnar
and
the
shaping
of
his
mind
he
seeketh
the
words
of
sigurd
and
gunnar
voice
doth
he
find
as
he
cries
i
know
thy
bidding
let
the
world
be
lief
or
loth
the
child
is
unborn
that
shall
hearken
how
sigurd
rued
his
oath
well
fare
thou
brother
gunnar
what
deed
shall
i
do
this
eve
that
i
shall
never
repent
of
that
thine
heart
shall
never
grieve
what
deed
shall
i
do
this
even
that
none
else
may
bring
to
the
birth
nay
not
the
king
of
the
niblungs
and
the
lord
of
the
best
of
the
earth
the
flames
rolled
up
to
the
heavens
and
the
stars
behind
were
bright
dark
hogni
sat
on
his
and
stared
out
into
the
night
and
there
stood
gunnar
the
king
in
sigurd
semblance
wrapped
as
sigurd
walking
in
slumber
for
in
grimhild
guile
was
he
lapped
that
his
heart
forgat
his
glory
and
the
ways
of
odin
lords
and
the
thought
was
frozen
within
him
and
the
might
of
spoken
words
but
sigurd
leapeth
on
greyfell
and
the
sword
in
his
hand
is
bare
and
the
gold
spurs
flame
on
his
heels
and
the
lifteth
his
hair
forth
greyfell
bounds
rejoicing
and
they
see
the
grey
wax
red
as
unheard
the
clasheth
and
the
flames
meet
over
his
head
yet
a
while
they
see
him
riding
as
through
the
rye
men
ride
when
the
word
goes
forth
in
the
summer
of
the
kings
by
the
but
the
fires
were
slaked
before
him
and
the
burned
no
more
than
the
ford
of
the
summer
waters
when
the
rainy
time
is
not
once
turned
sigurd
aback
nor
looked
the
ashy
ring
to
the
midnight
wilderness
drear
and
the
niblung
king
but
he
stayed
and
looked
before
him
and
lo
a
house
with
its
roof
of
the
red
gold
beaten
and
its
so
he
leapt
adown
from
greyfell
and
came
to
that
fair
abode
and
dark
in
the
gear
of
the
niblungs
through
the
gleaming
door
he
strode
all
light
within
was
that
dwelling
and
a
marvellous
hall
it
was
but
of
gold
were
its
hangings
woven
and
its
pillars
gleaming
as
glass
and
sigurd
said
in
his
heart
it
was
wrought
erewhile
for
a
god
but
he
looked
athwart
and
endlong
as
alone
its
floor
he
trod
and
lo
on
the
height
of
the
dais
is
upreared
a
graven
throne
and
thereon
a
woman
sitting
in
the
golden
place
alone
her
face
is
fair
and
awful
and
a
gold
crown
girdeth
her
head
and
a
sword
of
the
kings
she
beareth
and
her
hair
is
shed
the
laps
of
the
linen
that
ripples
adown
to
her
feet
as
a
swan
on
the
billow
unbroken
ere
the
firth
and
the
ocean
meet
on
the
cloths
she
sitteth
in
the
height
of
the
golden
place
nor
breaketh
the
hush
of
the
hall
though
her
eyes
be
set
on
his
face
now
he
sees
this
is
even
the
woman
of
whom
the
tale
hath
been
told
she
that
was
wrought
for
the
niblungs
the
bride
ordained
from
of
old
and
hushed
in
the
hall
he
standeth
and
a
long
while
looks
in
her
eyes
and
the
word
he
hath
shapen
for
gunnar
to
his
lips
may
never
arise
the
man
in
gunnar
semblance
looked
long
and
knew
no
deed
and
she
looked
and
her
eyes
were
dreadful
and
none
would
help
her
need
then
the
image
of
gunnar
trembled
and
the
flesh
of
the
shrank
for
he
heard
her
voice
on
the
silence
and
his
heart
of
her
anguish
drank
king
king
who
art
thou
that
comest
thou
lord
of
the
cloudy
gear
what
deed
for
the
shall
thy
strange
hands
fashion
here
the
speech
of
her
lips
pierced
through
him
like
the
point
of
the
bitter
sword
and
he
deemed
that
death
were
better
than
another
spoken
word
but
he
clencheth
his
hand
on
the
and
setteth
his
face
as
the
brass
and
the
voice
of
his
brother
gunnar
from
out
his
lips
doth
pass
when
thou
lookest
on
me
o
goddess
thou
seest
gunnar
the
king
the
king
and
the
lord
of
the
niblungs
and
the
chief
of
their
warfaring
but
art
thou
indeed
that
brynhild
of
whom
is
the
rumour
and
fame
that
she
bideth
the
coming
of
kings
to
ride
her
wavering
flame
lest
she
wed
the
and
the
world
grow
evil
and
vile
for
if
thou
be
none
other
i
will
speak
again
in
a
while
she
said
art
thou
gunnar
the
stranger
o
art
thou
the
man
that
i
see
yea
verily
i
am
brynhild
what
other
is
like
unto
me
o
men
of
the
earth
behold
me
hast
thou
seen
o
labouring
earth
such
sorrow
as
my
sorrow
or
such
evil
as
my
birth
then
spake
the
wildfire
trampler
that
gunnar
image
bore
o
brynhild
mighty
of
women
be
thou
glorious
evermore
thou
seest
gunnar
the
niblung
as
he
sits
mid
the
niblung
lords
and
rides
with
the
gods
of
battle
in
the
of
the
swords
hard
rang
his
voice
in
the
hall
and
a
while
she
spake
no
word
and
there
stood
the
image
of
gunnar
and
leaned
on
his
bright
blue
sword
but
at
last
she
cried
from
the
if
i
yet
am
alive
and
awake
i
know
no
words
for
the
speaking
nor
what
answer
i
may
make
she
ceased
and
he
answered
nothing
and
a
hush
on
the
hall
there
lay
and
the
moon
slipped
over
the
windows
as
he
clomb
the
heavenly
way
and
no
whit
stirred
the
raiment
of
brynhild
till
she
hearkened
the
voice
as
he
said
thou
art
none
of
the
women
that
swear
and
forswear
and
rejoice
forgetting
the
sorrow
of
kings
and
the
gods
and
the
labouring
earth
thou
shall
wed
with
king
gunnar
the
niblung
and
increase
his
worth
with
thy
worth
so
spake
he
in
semblance
of
gunnar
and
from
off
his
hand
he
drew
a
ring
of
the
spoils
of
the
southland
a
marvel
seen
but
of
few
and
he
set
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
she
turned
to
her
lord
and
spake
i
thank
thee
king
for
thy
goodwill
and
thy
pledge
of
love
i
take
depart
with
my
troth
to
thy
people
but
ere
full
ten
days
are
i
shall
come
to
the
sons
of
the
niblungs
and
then
shall
we
part
no
more
till
the
day
of
the
change
of
our
when
odin
and
freyia
shall
call
lo
here
my
gift
of
the
morning
was
my
dearest
treasure
of
all
but
thou
art
become
its
master
and
for
thee
was
it
since
thou
art
the
man
of
mine
oath
and
the
best
that
the
earth
hath
gained
and
lo
was
the
grief
of
andvari
and
the
lack
that
made
him
loth
the
last
of
the
ransom
the
ring
of
hindfell
oath
now
on
sigurd
hand
it
shineth
and
long
he
looketh
thereon
but
it
gave
him
back
no
memories
of
the
days
that
were
bygone
so
forth
from
the
hall
goes
the
wooer
and
slow
and
slow
he
goes
as
a
conquered
king
from
his
city
fares
forth
to
meet
his
foes
and
he
taketh
the
reins
of
greyfell
nor
yet
will
back
him
there
but
afoot
through
the
cold
slaked
ashes
of
doth
fare
with
his
eyes
cast
down
to
the
earth
till
he
heareth
the
wind
and
a
cry
and
raiseth
a
face
and
beholdeth
men
anigh
and
beholdeth
hogni
the
king
set
grey
on
his
steed
and
beholdeth
the
image
of
sigurd
the
king
in
the
golden
weed
then
he
stayeth
and
stareth
astonished
and
setteth
his
hand
to
his
sword
till
hogni
cries
from
his
saddle
and
his
word
is
a
kindly
word
hail
brother
the
king
of
the
people
hail
helper
of
my
kin
again
from
the
death
and
the
trouble
great
gifts
hast
thou
set
thee
to
win
for
thy
friends
and
the
niblung
children
and
hast
crowned
thine
earthly
fame
and
increased
thine
exceeding
glory
and
the
sound
of
thy
loved
name
nought
sigurd
spake
in
answer
but
looked
straight
forth
with
a
frown
and
stretched
out
his
hand
to
gunnar
as
one
that
claimeth
his
own
then
no
word
speaketh
gunnar
but
taketh
his
hand
in
his
hand
and
they
look
in
the
eyes
of
each
other
and
a
while
in
the
desert
they
stand
till
the
might
of
grimhild
prevaileth
and
the
twain
are
as
but
sad
was
the
golden
sigurd
though
his
eyes
knew
nought
of
scorn
and
he
spake
it
is
finished
o
gunnar
and
i
will
that
our
brotherhood
may
endure
through
the
good
and
the
evil
as
it
sprang
in
the
days
of
the
good
but
i
bid
thee
look
to
the
ending
that
the
deed
i
did
bear
nought
for
me
to
repent
of
for
thine
heart
of
hearts
to
grieve
thou
art
o
king
of
the
niblungs
to
brynhild
queen
of
the
earth
she
hath
sworn
thine
heart
to
cherish
and
increase
thy
worth
with
her
worth
she
shall
come
to
the
house
of
gunnar
ere
ten
days
are
past
and
and
thenceforth
the
life
of
brynhild
shall
part
from
thy
life
no
more
till
the
doom
of
our
kind
shall
speed
you
and
odin
and
freyia
shall
call
and
ye
bide
the
day
of
the
battle
and
the
uttermost
changing
of
all
the
praise
and
thanks
they
gave
him
the
words
of
love
they
spake
the
tale
that
the
world
should
hear
of
deeds
done
for
sigurd
sake
they
were
lovely
might
you
hear
them
but
they
lack
for
in
very
deed
their
sound
was
clean
forgotten
in
the
day
of
sigurd
need
so
that
night
in
the
hall
of
the
ancient
they
hold
again
and
the
gods
on
the
southland
hangings
smile
out
full
fair
and
fain
and
the
song
goes
up
of
sigurd
and
the
praise
of
his
fame
fulfilled
but
his
speech
in
the
dead
sleep
lieth
and
the
words
of
his
wisdom
are
chilled
and
men
say
the
king
is
careful
for
he
thinks
of
the
people
weal
and
his
heart
is
afraid
for
our
trouble
lest
the
gods
our
joyance
steal
but
that
night
when
the
feast
was
over
to
gudrun
sigurd
came
and
she
noted
the
ring
on
his
finger
and
she
knew
it
was
nowise
the
same
as
the
ring
he
was
wont
to
carry
so
she
bade
him
tell
thereof
then
he
turned
unto
her
kindly
and
his
words
were
words
of
love
nor
his
life
nor
his
death
he
heeded
but
told
her
last
night
tale
yea
he
drew
forth
the
sword
for
his
slaying
and
whetted
the
edges
of
bale
for
he
took
that
gold
of
andvari
that
curse
of
the
uttermost
land
and
he
spake
as
a
king
that
loveth
and
set
it
on
her
hand
but
her
heart
was
exceeding
joyous
as
he
kissed
her
sweet
and
soft
and
bade
her
bear
it
for
ever
that
she
might
remember
him
oft
when
his
hand
from
the
world
was
departed
and
he
sat
in
odin
home
brynhild
was
wedded
to
gunnar
the
so
ten
days
wore
over
and
on
the
the
folk
were
all
astir
in
the
niblung
house
till
the
watchers
on
the
towers
cried
to
them
tidings
of
a
goodly
company
drawing
nigh
upon
the
road
then
the
niblungs
got
them
to
horse
in
raiment
and
went
forth
to
meet
the
people
of
brynhild
first
rode
bands
of
maidens
arrayed
in
fine
linen
and
cloaks
and
after
them
came
a
golden
wain
with
horses
of
snowy
white
and
of
blue
and
therein
sat
brynhild
alone
clad
in
raiment
and
crowned
with
gold
then
they
hailed
her
sweet
and
goodly
and
so
she
entered
the
darksome
and
came
within
the
niblung
burg
so
fair
in
the
sun
of
the
forecourt
doth
brynhild
wain
shine
bright
and
the
huge
hall
riseth
before
her
and
the
ernes
cry
out
from
its
height
and
there
by
the
door
of
the
niblungs
she
sees
huge
warriors
stand
by
the
shoulders
greater
than
the
best
of
any
land
and
she
knoweth
the
chiefs
of
the
niblungs
the
dreaded
dukes
of
war
but
one
in
cloudy
raiment
stands
a
very
midst
the
door
and
ruddy
and
bright
is
his
visage
and
his
black
locks
wave
in
the
wind
and
she
knoweth
the
king
of
the
niblungs
and
the
man
she
came
to
find
then
nought
she
lingered
nor
loitered
but
stepped
to
the
earth
adown
with
reached
to
the
the
wearer
of
the
crown
and
she
said
i
behold
thee
gunnar
the
king
of
war
that
rode
through
the
waves
of
the
flickering
fire
to
the
door
of
mine
abode
and
for
this
i
needs
must
deem
thee
the
best
of
all
men
born
the
the
greatest
the
staunchest
of
thy
love
and
that
such
the
world
yet
holdeth
my
heart
is
fain
thereof
and
for
thee
i
deem
was
i
fashioned
and
for
thee
the
oath
i
swore
in
the
days
of
my
glory
and
wisdom
ere
the
days
of
youth
were
may
the
fire
stay
thy
glory
nor
the
thy
fame
through
ages
of
all
ages
may
the
wide
world
praise
thy
name
yea
oft
may
the
word
be
spoken
when
low
we
lie
at
rest
befell
in
the
days
of
gunnar
the
happiest
and
the
best
all
this
may
the
high
gods
give
thee
and
thereto
a
gift
i
give
the
body
of
queen
brynhild
so
long
as
both
we
live
with
unmoved
face
unfaltering
the
she
said
but
the
joy
sprang
up
in
gunnar
and
increased
his
goodlihead
and
he
cast
his
arms
about
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
and
he
said
the
gift
is
greater
than
all
treasure
of
the
south
as
glad
as
my
heart
this
moment
so
glad
may
be
thy
life
and
the
world
be
never
weary
of
the
joy
of
gunnar
wife
she
spake
no
word
and
smiled
not
but
she
held
his
hand
henceforth
and
he
said
now
take
the
greetings
of
my
men
the
most
of
worth
then
she
turned
her
face
to
the
and
hearkened
to
their
praise
and
she
spake
in
few
words
sweetly
and
blessed
their
coming
days
then
again
spake
gunnar
and
said
lo
hogni
my
brother
is
this
but
guttorm
is
far
on
the
and
seeketh
the
warrior
bliss
a
third
there
is
of
my
brethren
and
my
house
holds
none
so
great
in
the
hall
by
the
side
of
my
sister
thy
face
doth
he
await
then
brynhild
gave
fair
greeting
to
hogni
but
anon
she
turned
and
questioned
gunnar
of
his
words
concerning
that
brother
who
awaited
her
in
the
hall
i
deemed
the
sons
of
giuki
had
been
but
three
said
brynhild
this
fourth
this
the
mighty
is
he
akin
to
thee
and
gunnar
answered
he
is
nought
of
our
blood
but
the
gods
have
sent
him
to
usward
to
work
us
measureless
good
it
is
even
sigurd
the
volsung
the
best
man
ever
born
the
man
that
the
gods
withstand
not
my
friend
and
my
brother
sworn
she
heard
the
name
and
she
changed
not
but
her
feet
went
forth
as
he
led
and
under
the
cloudy
queen
brynhild
bowed
her
head
then
were
there
a
man
so
ancient
as
had
lived
beyond
his
peers
on
the
earth
that
beareth
all
things
a
tale
of
years
he
had
heard
no
sound
so
mighty
as
the
shout
that
shook
the
wall
when
brynhild
feet
unhearkened
first
trod
the
niblung
hall
no
whit
the
clamour
stirred
her
but
her
godlike
eyes
she
raised
and
betwixt
the
hedge
of
the
on
the
golden
gazed
and
the
man
that
sat
by
gudrun
but
as
the
rainless
cloud
ere
the
first
of
the
tempest
ariseth
the
latter
sun
doth
shroud
and
men
look
round
and
shudder
so
grimhild
came
between
the
silent
golden
sigurd
and
the
eyes
of
the
mighty
queen
and
again
heard
brynhild
greeting
and
again
she
spake
and
said
o
mother
of
the
niblungs
such
hap
be
on
thine
head
as
thy
love
for
me
the
stranger
was
past
the
pain
of
words
mayst
thou
see
thy
son
sons
glorious
in
the
meeting
of
the
swords
mayst
thou
sleep
and
doubt
thee
nothing
of
the
fortunes
of
thy
race
mayst
thou
hear
folk
call
yon
the
earth
most
happy
place
then
the
hushed
before
her
and
a
little
fell
aside
and
nought
from
the
eyes
of
brynhild
the
now
did
hide
and
the
face
so
long
desired
unchanged
from
time
agone
in
the
house
of
the
cloudy
people
from
the
niblung
shone
she
stood
with
her
hand
in
gunnar
and
all
about
and
around
were
the
unfamiliar
faces
and
the
folk
that
day
had
found
but
her
heart
ran
back
through
the
years
and
yet
her
lips
did
move
with
the
words
she
spake
on
hindfell
when
they
plighted
troth
of
love
lo
sigurd
fair
on
the
by
the
gudrun
side
in
the
midst
of
the
cloudy
people
in
the
dwelling
of
their
pride
his
face
is
exceeding
glorious
and
awful
to
behold
for
of
all
his
sorrow
he
knoweth
and
his
hope
smit
dead
and
cold
the
will
of
the
norns
is
accomplished
and
lo
they
wend
on
their
ways
and
leave
the
mighty
sigurd
to
deal
with
the
latter
days
the
gods
look
down
from
heaven
and
the
lonely
king
they
see
and
sorrow
over
his
sorrow
and
rejoice
in
his
majesty
for
the
will
of
the
norns
is
accomplished
and
outworn
is
grimhild
spell
and
nought
now
shall
blind
or
help
him
and
the
tale
shall
be
to
tell
he
hath
seen
the
face
of
brynhild
and
he
knows
why
she
hath
come
and
that
his
is
the
hand
that
hath
drawn
her
to
the
cloudy
people
home
he
knows
of
the
net
of
the
days
and
the
deeds
that
the
gods
have
bid
and
no
whit
of
the
sorrow
that
shall
be
from
his
wakened
soul
is
hid
and
his
glory
his
heart
restraineth
and
restraineth
the
hand
of
the
strong
from
the
hope
of
the
fools
of
desire
and
the
wrong
that
amendeth
wrong
and
brynhild
face
drew
near
him
with
eyes
grown
stern
and
strange
now
she
stands
on
the
floor
of
the
and
for
so
little
a
space
as
men
may
note
delaying
she
looketh
on
sigurd
face
ere
she
saith
i
have
greeted
many
in
the
niblungs
house
today
and
for
thee
is
the
last
of
my
greetings
ere
the
feast
shall
wear
away
hail
sigurd
son
of
the
volsungs
hail
lord
of
odin
storm
hail
rider
of
the
wasteland
and
slayer
of
the
worm
if
aught
thy
soul
shall
desire
while
yet
thou
livest
on
earth
i
pray
that
thou
mayst
win
it
nor
forget
its
might
and
worth
all
grief
sharp
scorn
sore
longing
stark
death
in
her
voice
he
knew
but
gone
forth
is
the
doom
of
the
norns
and
what
shall
he
answer
thereto
while
the
death
that
amendeth
lingers
and
they
twain
shall
dwell
for
awhile
in
the
niblung
house
together
by
the
hearth
that
forged
the
guile
so
he
spake
as
a
king
of
the
people
in
whom
all
fear
is
dead
and
his
anguish
no
man
noted
as
the
he
said
hail
fairest
of
all
things
fashioned
hail
thou
desire
of
eyes
hail
chooser
of
the
mightiest
and
teacher
of
the
wise
hail
wife
of
my
brother
gunnar
in
might
may
thy
days
endure
and
in
peace
without
a
trouble
that
the
world
weal
may
be
sure
but
the
song
sprang
up
in
the
hall
and
the
eagles
cried
from
above
and
forth
to
the
freshness
of
may
went
the
joyance
of
the
feast
and
sigurd
sat
with
the
niblungs
and
gave
ear
to
most
and
to
least
and
showed
no
sign
to
the
people
of
the
grief
that
on
him
lay
nor
seemeth
he
worser
to
any
than
he
was
on
the
yesterday
the
contention
betwixt
the
so
now
must
sigurd
and
brynhild
abide
together
in
the
burg
of
the
niblungs
yet
each
must
bear
the
burden
of
sorrow
alone
brynhild
held
close
converse
with
gudrun
and
behaved
humbly
towards
her
lest
strife
should
arise
between
them
but
gudrun
filled
with
pride
that
she
was
the
wife
of
so
great
a
man
as
sigurd
deemed
it
a
little
matter
that
all
others
should
give
her
honour
and
knowing
how
sigurd
had
ridden
the
fire
she
cherished
great
scorn
of
gunnar
and
brynhild
in
her
heart
and
her
pride
waxed
daily
greater
of
the
hogni
men
tell
how
he
grew
wiser
day
by
day
and
more
learned
in
the
craft
of
his
mother
grimhild
as
for
gunnar
he
lived
with
brynhild
in
great
honour
and
praise
from
all
men
but
the
thought
of
how
sigurd
had
ridden
the
fire
in
his
semblance
lay
heavy
upon
him
he
brooded
thereon
in
bitterness
and
envy
and
the
lie
shadowed
his
so
that
he
had
but
small
joy
in
his
wife
and
grimhild
marking
his
heavy
mood
wrought
upon
him
with
cunning
words
and
he
gave
ear
to
her
for
ever
she
spake
of
kings
supplanters
who
bear
away
the
praise
from
their
lords
after
great
deeds
are
done
and
often
her
talk
was
of
the
mighty
power
that
he
holdeth
who
knoweth
the
shame
of
a
king
so
gunnar
hearkened
and
ill
thoughts
grew
within
him
but
calm
as
a
god
who
hath
none
to
call
his
foes
betwixt
the
kings
and
the
people
the
golden
sigurd
goes
no
knowledge
of
man
he
lacketh
and
the
lore
he
gained
of
old
from
the
ancient
heart
of
the
serpent
and
the
wallower
on
the
gold
springs
fresh
in
the
soul
of
sigurd
the
heart
of
hogni
he
sees
and
the
heart
of
his
brother
gunnar
and
he
grieveth
sore
for
these
it
was
most
in
these
latter
days
that
his
fame
went
far
abroad
the
helper
the
overcomer
the
righteous
sundering
sword
the
loveliest
king
of
the
the
man
of
sweetest
speech
whose
ear
is
dull
to
no
man
that
his
helping
shall
beseech
the
seer
of
all
things
that
wasteth
every
wrong
the
straightener
of
the
crooked
the
hammer
of
the
strong
lo
such
was
the
son
of
sigmund
in
the
days
whereof
i
tell
the
dread
of
the
doom
and
the
battle
and
all
children
loved
him
well
now
gudrun
scorn
of
brynhild
waxed
greater
as
she
thought
on
the
knowledge
that
she
held
and
it
needed
but
a
little
that
she
should
speak
out
the
whole
tale
such
was
her
mind
when
it
befell
her
to
go
with
brynhild
to
bathe
in
the
niblung
river
there
it
chanced
that
they
fell
to
talk
of
their
husbands
and
gudrun
named
sigurd
the
best
of
the
world
thereat
brynhild
stung
by
her
love
for
sigurd
and
the
memory
of
his
broken
troth
for
so
she
deemed
it
cried
out
saying
thy
lord
is
but
gunnar
serving
man
to
do
his
bidding
but
my
mate
is
the
king
of
who
rode
the
wavering
fire
and
hath
dared
very
death
to
win
me
then
gudrun
held
out
her
hand
and
a
golden
gleam
shone
on
her
finger
at
the
sight
whereof
brynhild
waxed
wan
as
a
dead
woman
lo
said
gudrun
i
had
andvari
ring
of
sigurd
and
indeed
thou
sayest
truly
that
he
did
gunnar
bidding
for
he
took
the
king
semblance
and
hid
his
own
shape
in
gunnar
thus
he
wooed
the
bride
for
gunnar
and
for
gunnar
rode
the
fire
and
now
by
this
token
mayest
thou
know
whether
thy
husband
is
truly
the
best
of
kings
and
brynhild
spake
no
word
in
answer
but
clad
herself
in
haste
and
fled
from
the
river
and
gudrun
followed
her
in
triumph
of
heart
yet
as
the
day
wore
on
she
repented
of
her
words
and
feared
the
deeds
that
brynhild
might
do
and
at
even
she
sought
her
alone
and
craved
pardon
then
spake
brynhild
the
queen
i
repent
me
of
my
bitter
words
this
day
yet
one
thing
i
beseech
thee
do
thou
say
that
thou
hadst
the
ring
of
gunnar
and
not
of
sigurd
lest
i
be
shamed
before
all
men
what
said
gudrun
hast
thou
heard
that
the
wives
of
the
niblungs
lie
nay
sigurd
it
was
who
set
this
ring
on
my
finger
and
therewith
he
told
me
the
shame
of
my
brother
gunnar
how
his
glory
was
turned
to
a
scoff
and
brynhild
seeing
that
the
tale
of
the
deceiving
wrought
against
her
might
not
be
hidden
lifted
her
voice
and
cursed
the
house
of
the
niblungs
wherein
she
had
suffered
such
woe
so
the
queens
parted
in
great
wrath
and
bitterness
the
exceeding
great
grief
and
mourning
of
now
on
the
morrow
it
was
known
that
brynhild
was
sick
nor
would
she
reveal
the
cause
to
any
then
gunnar
besought
her
to
be
comforted
and
to
show
what
ailed
her
but
for
a
long
while
he
might
win
no
word
in
answer
thereat
the
evil
thoughts
that
grimhild
had
sown
in
his
heart
grew
strong
and
he
cried
in
bitter
anger
lo
brynhild
i
deem
thou
art
sick
for
love
of
my
foe
the
supplanter
of
kings
he
who
hath
shone
like
a
serpent
this
long
while
past
amidst
the
honour
of
our
kin
then
at
last
was
brynhild
moved
to
look
on
him
and
she
besought
him
saying
swear
to
me
gunnar
that
i
may
live
and
say
that
thou
gavest
andvari
ring
to
gudrun
thou
and
not
thy
captain
of
war
thereby
gunnar
understood
that
all
his
falsehood
was
known
to
her
so
that
never
again
might
they
two
have
any
joy
together
he
had
no
answering
word
but
turned
from
her
and
departed
for
bitter
shame
was
come
on
him
and
hatred
of
sigurd
burnt
in
his
soul
like
fire
then
as
evening
drew
on
boding
of
evil
fell
on
gudrun
and
she
sought
her
brothers
that
they
might
plead
with
brynhild
to
pardon
her
and
forget
her
bitter
taunts
but
gunnar
she
found
seated
alone
arrayed
in
his
and
on
his
knees
lay
his
sword
neither
would
he
hear
any
word
of
further
pleading
with
brynhild
then
sought
she
hogni
and
behold
he
was
in
the
like
guise
and
sat
as
one
that
waits
for
a
foe
so
she
sped
to
sigurd
but
chill
fear
fell
on
her
beholding
him
for
he
was
dight
in
the
helm
of
aweing
and
his
golden
hauberk
and
the
wrath
lay
on
his
knees
neither
would
he
then
speak
to
brynhild
so
that
heavy
night
passed
away
and
there
was
but
little
sleep
in
the
abode
of
the
niblungs
and
with
the
dawn
sigurd
arose
and
sought
brynhild
chamber
where
she
lay
as
one
dead
like
a
pillar
of
light
he
stood
in
the
sunshine
and
the
wrath
rattled
by
his
side
and
brynhild
looked
on
him
and
said
art
thou
come
to
behold
me
thou
the
mightiest
and
the
worst
of
my
betrayers
then
for
very
grief
the
breast
of
sigurd
heaved
so
that
the
rings
of
his
byrny
burst
asunder
and
he
cried
o
live
brynhild
beloved
for
hereafter
shalt
thou
know
of
the
snare
and
the
lie
that
entrapped
us
and
the
measureless
grief
of
my
soul
it
is
said
brynhild
for
i
may
live
no
longer
and
the
gods
have
forgotten
the
earth
and
in
such
despair
must
he
leave
her
the
slaying
of
sigurd
the
then
at
high
noon
brynhild
sent
for
gunnar
and
sought
to
whet
him
to
the
slaying
of
sigurd
for
to
such
hatred
was
her
love
turned
i
look
upon
thee
said
brynhild
i
know
thy
race
and
thy
name
yet
meseems
the
deed
thou
sparest
to
amend
thine
evil
and
shame
nought
nought
he
said
may
amend
it
save
the
hungry
eyeless
sword
and
the
war
without
hope
or
honour
and
the
strife
without
reward
thou
hast
spoken
the
word
said
brynhild
if
the
word
is
enough
it
is
well
let
us
eat
and
drink
and
be
merry
that
all
men
of
our
words
may
tell
o
woman
said
gunnar
what
deed
lieth
under
the
tongue
what
day
for
the
dearth
of
the
people
when
the
seed
of
thy
sowing
hath
sprung
she
said
our
garment
is
shame
and
nought
the
web
shall
rend
save
the
day
without
repentance
and
the
deed
that
nought
may
amend
speak
mighty
of
women
said
gunnar
and
cry
out
the
name
and
the
deed
that
the
ends
of
the
earth
may
hearken
and
the
niblungs
grievous
need
to
slay
she
said
is
the
deed
to
slay
a
king
ere
the
morn
and
the
name
is
sigurd
the
volsung
my
love
and
thy
brother
sworn
she
turned
and
departed
from
him
and
he
knew
not
whither
she
went
but
he
took
his
sword
from
the
girdle
and
the
round
it
rent
and
into
the
house
he
gat
him
and
the
sunlit
fair
abode
but
his
heart
in
the
waded
as
through
the
halls
he
strode
till
he
came
to
a
chamber
apart
and
grimhild
his
mother
was
there
and
there
was
his
brother
hogni
in
the
cloudy
niblung
gear
there
was
silence
between
them
as
of
them
that
have
spoken
and
wait
till
the
words
of
their
mouths
be
accomplished
by
slow
unholpen
fate
but
they
turned
to
the
door
and
beheld
him
and
he
took
his
sheathed
sword
and
cast
it
adown
betwixt
them
and
it
clashed
half
bare
on
the
board
and
grimhild
spake
as
it
clattered
for
whom
are
the
rent
for
whom
is
the
whetted
and
the
edge
of
thine
intent
he
said
for
the
heart
of
sigurd
and
thus
all
is
rent
away
betwixt
this
word
and
his
slaying
save
a
little
hour
of
day
again
spake
grimhild
the
where
then
is
guttorm
the
brave
for
he
blent
not
his
blood
with
the
volsung
nor
his
oath
to
sigurd
gave
nor
called
on
earth
to
witness
nor
went
beneath
the
yoke
and
now
is
he
sigurd
foeman
and
who
may
curse
his
stroke
then
hogni
laughed
and
answered
his
feet
on
the
threshold
stand
forged
is
thy
sword
o
mother
and
its
hilts
are
come
to
hand
ho
guttorm
enter
and
hearken
to
the
counsel
of
the
wise
then
in
through
the
door
strode
guttorm
in
hunter
guise
with
no
steel
save
his
girded
but
his
eyes
stared
wild
as
he
spake
what
words
are
ye
hiding
from
the
youngest
niblung
child
what
work
is
to
win
my
brethren
that
ye
sit
in
warrior
weed
and
tell
me
nought
of
the
glory
and
cover
up
the
deed
then
uprose
grimhild
the
and
took
the
cup
again
had
she
brewed
that
and
laboured
not
in
vain
for
therein
was
the
creeping
venom
and
hearts
of
things
that
prey
on
the
hidden
lives
of
ocean
and
never
look
on
day
and
the
heart
of
the
ravening
and
the
beast
and
the
spent
slaked
heart
of
the
the
guileful
cup
increased
but
huge
words
of
ancient
evil
about
its
rim
were
scored
the
curse
and
the
eyeless
craving
of
the
first
that
fashioned
sword
so
the
cup
in
her
hand
was
gleaming
as
she
turned
unto
guttorm
and
spake
be
merry
king
of
the
we
hold
counsel
for
thy
sake
the
work
is
a
god
son
slaying
and
thine
is
the
hand
that
shall
smite
that
thy
name
may
be
set
in
glory
and
thy
deeds
live
on
in
light
forth
flashed
the
flame
from
his
eyen
and
he
cried
where
then
is
the
foe
this
dread
of
mine
house
and
my
brethren
that
my
hand
may
lay
him
alow
drink
son
she
said
and
be
merry
and
i
shall
tell
his
name
whose
death
shall
crown
thy
and
increase
thy
fame
with
his
fame
he
drinketh
and
craveth
for
battle
and
his
hand
for
a
sword
doth
seek
and
he
looketh
about
on
his
brethren
but
his
lips
no
word
may
speak
they
speak
the
name
and
he
hears
not
and
again
he
drinks
of
the
cup
and
knows
not
friend
nor
kindred
and
the
wrath
in
his
heart
wells
up
that
no
god
may
bear
unmingled
and
he
cries
a
wordless
cry
as
the
last
of
the
day
is
departing
and
the
dusk
time
drawing
anigh
then
grimhild
goes
from
the
chamber
and
bringeth
his
harness
of
war
and
therewith
they
array
his
body
and
he
drinketh
the
cup
once
more
and
his
heart
is
set
on
the
murder
and
now
may
he
understand
what
soul
is
dight
for
the
slaying
and
what
quarry
is
for
his
hand
for
again
they
tell
him
of
sigurd
and
the
man
he
remembereth
and
praiseth
his
mighty
name
and
his
deeds
that
laughed
on
death
now
dusk
and
dark
draw
over
and
through
the
glimmering
house
they
go
to
the
place
of
the
niblungs
the
high
hall
and
glorious
for
hard
by
is
the
chamber
of
sigurd
there
dight
in
their
harness
of
war
in
their
thrones
sit
gunnar
and
hogni
but
guttorm
stands
on
the
floor
with
his
blue
blade
naked
before
them
the
torches
flare
from
the
wall
and
the
woven
waver
but
the
hush
is
deep
in
the
hall
and
those
niblung
faces
change
not
though
the
slow
moon
slips
from
her
height
and
earth
is
acold
ere
dawning
and
new
winds
shake
the
night
now
it
was
in
the
earliest
that
guttorm
stirred
in
his
place
and
the
tinkled
upon
him
as
he
turned
his
face
and
went
forth
from
the
hall
and
the
but
the
kings
sat
still
in
their
pride
and
hearkened
the
clash
of
his
going
and
heeded
how
it
died
slow
all
alone
goeth
guttorm
to
sigurd
chamber
door
and
all
is
open
before
him
and
the
white
moon
lies
on
the
floor
and
the
bed
where
sigurd
lieth
with
gudrun
on
his
breast
and
light
comes
her
breath
from
her
bosom
in
the
joy
of
infinite
rest
then
guttorm
stands
on
the
threshold
and
his
heart
of
the
murder
is
fain
and
he
thinks
of
the
deeds
of
sigurd
and
praiseth
his
greatness
and
gain
bright
blue
is
his
blade
in
the
moonlight
but
lo
how
sigurd
lies
as
the
carven
dead
that
die
not
with
fair
eyes
and
their
glory
gleameth
on
guttorm
and
the
hate
in
his
heart
is
chilled
and
he
shrinketh
aback
from
the
threshold
and
knoweth
not
what
he
willed
thereon
he
turned
him
again
to
the
hall
and
the
kings
beheld
his
unstained
sword
in
the
but
they
cast
him
never
a
word
then
shame
and
wrath
urged
him
and
he
wended
the
second
time
to
sigurd
chamber
but
yet
again
the
dread
eyes
of
the
volsung
were
open
and
he
fled
from
their
light
to
his
biding
brethren
now
dieth
moon
and
candle
and
though
the
day
be
nigh
the
roof
of
the
hall
seems
far
aloof
as
the
sky
but
a
glimmer
grows
on
the
pavement
and
the
ernes
on
the
stir
then
the
brethren
hist
and
hearken
for
a
sound
of
feet
they
hear
and
into
the
hall
of
the
niblungs
a
white
thing
cometh
apace
but
the
sword
of
guttorm
upriseth
and
he
wendeth
from
his
place
and
the
clash
of
steel
goes
with
him
yet
loud
as
it
may
sound
still
more
they
hear
those
footsteps
on
the
ground
and
the
hearts
of
the
niblungs
waver
and
their
pride
is
smitten
acold
for
they
look
on
that
latest
comer
and
brynhild
they
behold
but
she
sits
by
their
side
in
silence
and
heeds
them
nothing
more
than
the
grey
morning
heeds
war
but
guttorm
clashed
in
the
cloisters
and
through
the
silence
strode
and
scarce
on
the
threshold
of
sigurd
a
little
while
abode
there
the
moon
from
the
floor
hath
departed
and
heaven
without
is
grey
and
afar
in
the
eastern
quarter
faint
glimmer
streaks
of
day
close
over
the
head
of
sigurd
the
wrath
gleams
wan
and
bare
and
the
niblung
woman
stirreth
and
her
brow
is
knit
with
fear
but
the
king
closed
eyes
are
hidden
loose
lie
his
empty
hands
there
is
nought
the
sword
of
the
slayer
and
the
wonder
of
all
lands
then
guttorm
laughed
in
his
and
his
sword
leapt
up
on
high
as
he
sprang
to
the
bed
from
the
threshold
and
cried
a
wordless
cry
and
with
all
the
might
of
the
niblungs
through
sigurd
body
thrust
and
turned
and
fled
from
the
chamber
and
fell
amid
the
dust
within
the
door
and
without
it
the
slayer
slain
by
the
slain
for
the
cast
of
the
sword
of
sigurd
had
smitten
his
body
atwain
while
yet
his
cry
of
onset
through
the
echoing
chambers
went
woe
me
how
the
house
of
the
niblungs
by
another
cry
was
rent
the
wakening
wail
of
gudrun
as
she
shrank
in
the
river
of
blood
from
the
breast
of
the
mighty
sigurd
he
heard
it
and
understood
and
rose
up
on
the
sword
of
guttorm
and
turned
from
the
country
of
death
and
spake
words
of
as
he
strove
for
life
and
breath
wail
not
o
child
of
the
niblungs
i
am
smitten
but
thou
shall
live
in
remembrance
of
our
glory
mid
the
gifts
the
gods
shall
give
she
stayed
her
cry
to
hearken
and
her
heart
well
nigh
stood
still
but
he
spake
mourn
not
o
gudrun
this
stroke
is
the
last
of
ill
fear
leaveth
the
house
of
the
niblungs
on
this
breaking
of
the
morn
mayst
thou
live
o
woman
beloved
unforsaken
unforlorn
then
he
sank
aback
on
the
sword
and
down
to
his
lips
she
bent
if
some
sound
therefrom
she
might
hearken
for
his
breath
was
spent
it
is
brynhild
deed
he
murmured
and
the
woman
that
loves
me
well
nought
now
is
left
to
repent
of
and
the
tale
abides
to
tell
i
have
done
many
deeds
in
my
and
all
these
and
my
love
they
lie
in
the
hollow
hand
of
odin
till
the
day
of
the
world
go
by
i
have
done
and
i
may
not
undo
i
have
given
and
i
take
not
again
art
thou
other
than
i
allfather
wilt
thou
gather
my
glory
in
vain
there
was
silence
then
in
the
chamber
as
the
dawn
spread
wide
and
grey
and
hushed
was
the
hall
of
the
niblungs
at
the
of
day
long
gudrun
hung
the
volsung
and
waited
the
coming
word
then
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
sigurd
and
touched
her
love
and
her
lord
and
the
broad
day
fell
on
his
visage
and
she
knew
she
was
there
alone
and
her
heart
was
wrung
with
anguish
and
she
uttered
a
weary
moan
then
brynhild
laughed
in
the
hall
and
the
first
of
men
voices
was
that
since
when
on
the
kings
in
the
had
sat
in
the
house
rose
rumour
and
stir
and
men
stood
up
in
the
morn
and
their
hearts
with
doubt
were
shaken
as
if
with
the
uttermost
horn
the
cry
and
the
calling
spread
and
shields
clashed
down
from
the
wall
and
swords
in
the
chamber
glittered
and
men
ran
apace
to
the
hall
nor
knew
what
man
to
question
nor
who
had
tidings
to
give
nor
what
were
the
days
thenceforward
wherein
the
folk
should
live
but
ever
the
word
is
amongst
them
that
sigurd
the
volsung
is
slain
and
the
spears
in
the
hall
were
tossing
as
the
rye
in
the
windy
plain
but
they
look
aloft
to
the
and
they
see
the
gleam
of
the
gold
and
gunnar
the
king
of
battle
and
hogni
wise
and
cold
and
brynhild
the
wonder
of
women
and
her
face
is
deadly
pale
and
the
kings
are
clad
in
their
and
bared
are
the
edges
of
bale
then
cold
fear
falleth
upon
them
but
the
noise
and
the
clamour
abate
and
they
look
on
the
gunnar
and
awhile
for
his
word
they
wait
but
as
he
riseth
above
them
doth
a
shriek
through
the
tumult
ring
awake
o
house
of
the
niblungs
for
slain
is
sigurd
the
king
then
nothing
faltered
gunnar
but
he
stood
the
niblung
folk
and
over
the
hall
the
words
of
pride
he
spoke
mourn
now
o
niblung
people
for
gone
is
sigurd
our
guest
and
guttorm
the
king
is
departed
and
this
is
our
day
of
unrest
but
all
this
of
the
norns
was
and
herein
is
odin
hand
cast
down
are
the
mighty
of
but
the
niblung
house
shall
stand
mourn
then
today
and
tomorrow
but
the
third
day
waken
and
live
for
the
gods
died
not
this
morning
and
great
gifts
they
have
to
give
he
spake
and
awhile
was
silence
and
then
did
the
cry
outbreak
and
many
there
were
of
the
that
wept
for
sigurd
sake
and
they
wept
for
their
little
children
and
they
wept
for
those
unborn
who
should
know
the
earth
without
him
and
the
world
of
his
worth
forlorn
so
rent
is
the
joy
of
the
niblungs
and
their
simple
days
and
fain
from
that
ancient
house
are
departed
and
who
shall
buy
them
again
for
he
the
redeemer
the
helper
the
crown
of
all
their
worth
they
looked
upon
him
and
wondered
they
loved
and
they
thrust
him
forth
the
mighty
grief
of
gudrun
over
sigurd
but
as
for
the
grief
of
gudrun
over
sigurd
no
man
may
tell
it
long
she
lay
on
his
body
and
spent
herself
in
weeping
but
at
last
she
arose
and
cursed
brynhild
and
gunnar
and
all
the
niblung
house
saying
o
hearken
hearken
gunnar
may
the
dear
gold
drag
thee
adown
and
greyfell
ruddy
burden
and
the
treasure
of
renown
and
the
rings
that
ye
swore
the
oath
on
yea
if
all
avengers
die
may
earth
that
ye
bade
remember
on
the
blood
of
sigurd
cry
be
this
land
as
waste
as
the
that
the
lips
of
fools
have
sworn
may
it
rain
through
this
broken
and
snow
on
the
hearth
forlorn
and
may
no
man
draw
anigh
it
to
tell
of
the
ruin
and
the
wrack
yea
may
i
be
a
mock
for
the
idle
if
my
feet
come
ever
aback
if
my
heart
think
kind
of
the
chambers
if
mine
eyes
shall
yearn
to
behold
the
house
of
my
fathers
the
house
beloved
of
old
and
therewith
gudrun
fled
forever
from
the
burg
of
the
niblungs
and
none
dared
hinder
or
follow
her
and
none
knew
whither
she
turned
for
refuge
the
passing
away
of
once
more
on
the
fair
shineth
the
glorious
sun
and
the
niblung
children
labour
on
a
deed
that
shall
be
done
for
out
in
the
people
meadows
they
raise
a
bale
on
high
the
oak
and
the
ash
together
and
thereon
shall
the
mighty
lie
nor
gold
nor
steel
shall
be
lacking
nor
savour
of
sweet
spice
nor
cloths
in
the
southlands
woven
nor
webs
of
untold
price
the
work
grows
toil
is
as
nothing
long
blasts
of
the
mighty
horn
from
the
topmost
tower
the
woeful
world
are
borne
but
brynhild
cried
to
her
maidens
now
open
ark
and
chest
and
draw
forth
queenly
raiment
of
the
loveliest
and
the
best
red
rings
that
the
fashioned
fair
cloths
that
queens
have
sewed
to
array
the
bride
for
the
mighty
and
the
traveller
for
the
road
they
wept
as
they
wrought
her
bidding
and
did
on
her
goodliest
gear
but
she
laughed
mid
the
dainty
linen
and
the
fashioned
fair
she
arose
from
the
bed
of
the
niblungs
and
her
face
no
more
was
wan
as
a
star
in
the
heavens
mid
the
dusky
house
she
shone
and
they
that
stood
about
her
their
hearts
were
raised
aloft
amid
their
fear
and
wonder
then
she
spake
them
kind
and
soft
now
give
me
the
sword
o
maidens
wherewith
i
sheared
the
wind
when
the
kings
of
earth
were
gathered
to
know
the
chooser
mind
all
sheathed
the
maidens
brought
it
and
feared
the
hidden
blade
but
the
naked
edges
across
her
knees
she
laid
and
spake
the
riches
the
gear
my
fathers
left
all
woven
wonders
all
rings
from
battle
reft
all
goods
of
men
desired
now
strew
them
on
the
floor
and
so
share
among
you
maidens
the
gifts
of
brynhild
store
then
upright
by
the
bed
of
the
niblungs
for
a
moment
doth
she
stand
and
the
blade
flasheth
bright
in
the
chamber
but
no
more
they
hinder
her
hand
than
if
a
god
were
smiting
to
rend
the
world
in
two
then
dulled
are
the
glittering
edges
and
the
bitter
point
cleaves
through
the
breast
of
the
brynhild
and
her
feet
from
the
pavement
fail
and
the
sigh
of
her
heart
is
hearkened
mid
the
hush
of
the
maidens
wail
chill
deep
is
the
fear
upon
them
but
they
bring
her
aback
to
the
bed
and
her
hand
is
yet
on
the
hilts
and
sidelong
droopeth
her
head
then
there
cometh
a
cry
from
withoutward
and
gunnar
hurrying
feet
are
swift
on
the
kingly
threshold
and
brynhild
blood
they
meet
low
down
the
bed
he
hangeth
and
hearkeneth
for
her
word
and
her
heavy
lids
are
opened
to
look
on
the
niblung
lord
and
she
saith
i
pray
thee
a
prayer
the
last
word
in
the
world
i
speak
that
ye
bear
me
forth
to
sigurd
and
the
hand
my
hand
would
seek
the
bale
for
the
dead
is
builded
it
is
wrought
full
wide
on
the
plain
it
is
raised
for
earth
best
helper
and
thereon
is
room
for
twain
ye
have
hung
the
shields
about
it
and
the
southland
hangings
spread
there
lay
me
adown
by
sigurd
and
my
head
beside
his
head
then
they
took
the
body
of
brynhild
in
the
raiment
that
she
wore
and
out
through
the
gate
of
the
niblungs
the
holy
corpse
they
bore
and
thence
forth
to
the
mead
of
the
people
and
the
shielded
bale
then
afresh
in
the
open
meadows
breaks
forth
the
women
wail
when
they
see
the
bed
of
sigurd
and
the
glittering
of
his
gear
and
fresh
is
the
wail
of
the
people
as
brynhild
draweth
anear
and
the
tidings
go
before
her
that
for
twain
the
bale
is
built
that
for
twain
is
the
shielded
and
the
pleasant
odours
spilt
there
is
peace
on
the
bale
of
sigurd
and
the
gods
look
down
from
on
high
and
they
see
the
lids
of
the
volsung
close
shut
against
the
sky
as
he
lies
with
his
shield
beside
him
in
the
hauberk
all
of
gold
that
has
not
its
like
in
the
heavens
nor
has
earth
of
its
fellow
told
and
forth
from
the
helm
of
aweing
are
the
sunbeams
flashing
wide
and
the
sheathed
wrath
of
sigurd
lies
still
by
his
mighty
side
then
cometh
an
elder
of
days
a
man
of
the
ancient
times
who
is
long
past
sorrow
and
joy
and
the
steep
of
the
bale
he
climbs
and
he
kneeleth
down
by
sigurd
and
bareth
the
wrath
to
the
sun
that
the
beams
are
gathered
about
it
and
from
hilt
to
run
and
wide
the
plain
of
the
niblungs
doth
the
light
of
the
branstock
glare
till
the
wondering
on
that
star
of
noontide
stare
and
fear
for
many
an
evil
but
the
ancient
man
stands
still
with
the
on
his
shoulder
nor
thinks
of
good
or
of
ill
till
the
feet
of
brynhild
bearers
on
the
topmost
bale
are
laid
and
her
bed
is
dight
by
sigurd
then
he
sinks
the
pale
white
blade
and
lays
it
the
sleepers
and
leaves
them
there
alone
he
the
last
that
shall
ever
behold
them
and
his
days
are
well
nigh
done
then
is
silence
over
the
plain
in
the
noon
shine
the
torches
pale
as
the

of

bear

to

in

ariseth
and

leap

with

voice
crieth
the

a

and

cry
and

cast
up

to
the

without
