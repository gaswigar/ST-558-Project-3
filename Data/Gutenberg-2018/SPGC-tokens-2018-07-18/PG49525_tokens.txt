a
miracle
happened
a
lensman
adventure
in
the
great
chapter
the
visitor
making
his
way
unobserved
through
the
crowded
main
laboratory
of
the
hill
stepped
up
to
within
six
feet
of
the
back
of
a
big
norwegian
seated
at
an
bench
drawing
an
automatic
pistol
he
shot
the
apparently
unsuspecting
scientist
seven
times
as
fast
as
he
could
pull
the
trigger
twice
through
the
brain
five
times
closely
spaced
through
the
spine
ah
gharlane
of
eddore
i
have
been
expecting
you
to
look
me
up
sit
down
blonde
nels
bergenholm
completely
undisturbed
by
the
passage
of
the
stream
of
bullets
through
his
head
and
body
turned
and
waved
one
huge
hand
at
a
stool
beside
his
own
but
those
were
not
ordinary
projectiles
the
visitor
protested
neither
person
or
rather
entity
was
in
the
least
surprised
that
no
one
else
had
paid
any
attention
to
what
had
happened
but
it
was
clear
that
the
one
was
taken
aback
by
the
failure
of
his
murderous
attack
they
should
have
volatilized
that
form
of
flesh
should
at
least
have
blown
you
back
to
arisia
where
you
belong
ordinary
or
extraordinary
what
matter
as
you
in
the
guise
of
gray
roger
told
conway
costigan
a
short
time
since
permitted
that
as
a
demonstration
of
futility
know
gharlane
once
and
for
all
that
you
will
no
longer
be
allowed
to
act
directly
against
any
adherent
of
civilization
wherever
situate
we
of
arisia
will
not
interfere
in
person
with
your
proposed
conquest
of
the
two
galaxies
as
you
have
planned
it
since
the
stresses
and
conflicts
involved
are
necessary
and
i
may
add
sufficient
to
produce
the
civilization
which
must
and
shall
come
into
being
therefore
neither
will
you
or
any
other
eddorian
so
interfere
you
will
go
back
to
eddore
and
you
will
stay
there
think
you
so
gharlane
sneered
you
who
have
been
so
afraid
of
us
for
over
two
thousand
million
tellurian
years
that
you
dared
not
let
us
even
learn
of
you
so
afraid
of
us
that
you
dared
not
take
any
action
to
avert
the
destruction
of
any
one
of
your
budding
civilizations
upon
any
one
of
the
worlds
of
either
galaxy
so
afraid
that
you
dare
not
even
now
meet
me
mind
to
mind
but
insist
upon
the
use
of
this
slow
and
unsatisfactory
oral
communication
between
us
either
your
thinking
is
loose
confused
and
turbid
which
i
do
not
believe
to
be
the
case
or
you
are
trying
to
lull
me
into
believing
that
you
are
stupid
bergenholm
voice
was
calm
unmoved
i
do
not
that
you
will
go
back
to
eddore
i
know
it
you
too
as
soon
as
you
have
become
informed
upon
certain
matters
will
know
it
you
protest
against
the
use
of
spoken
language
because
it
is
as
you
know
the
easiest
simplest
and
surest
way
of
preventing
you
from
securing
any
iota
of
the
knowledge
for
which
you
are
so
desperately
searching
as
to
a
meeting
of
our
two
minds
they
met
fully
just
before
you
operating
as
gray
roger
remembered
that
which
your
entire
race
forgot
long
ago
as
a
consequence
of
that
meeting
i
so
learned
every
line
and
vibration
of
your
life
pattern
as
to
be
able
to
greet
you
by
your
symbol
gharlane
of
eddore
whereas
you
know
nothing
of
me
save
that
i
am
an
arisian
a
fact
which
has
been
obvious
from
the
first
in
an
attempt
to
create
a
diversion
gharlane
released
the
zone
of
compulsion
which
he
had
been
holding
but
the
arisian
took
it
over
so
smoothly
that
no
human
being
within
range
was
conscious
of
any
change
it
is
true
that
for
many
cycles
of
time
we
concealed
our
existence
from
you
bergenholm
went
on
without
a
break
since
the
reason
for
that
concealment
will
still
further
confuse
you
i
will
tell
you
what
it
was
had
you
eddorians
learned
of
us
sooner
you
might
have
been
able
to
forge
a
weapon
of
power
sufficient
to
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
an
end
which
is
now
certain
it
is
true
that
your
operations
as
lo
sung
of
uighar
were
not
constrained
as
mithridates
of
pontus
as
sulla
marius
and
nero
of
rome
as
hannibal
of
carthage
as
those
wights
alcixerxes
of
greece
and
menocoptes
of
egypt
as
genghis
khan
and
attila
and
the
kaiser
and
mussolini
and
hitler
and
the
tyrant
of
asia
you
were
allowed
to
do
as
you
pleased
similar
activities
upon
rigel
four
velantia
palain
seven
and
elsewhere
were
also
allowed
to
proceed
without
effective
opposition
with
the
appearance
of
virgil
samms
however
the
time
arrived
to
put
an
end
to
your
customary
pernicious
obstructive
and
destructive
activities
i
therefore
interposed
a
barrier
between
you
and
those
who
would
otherwise
be
completely
defenseless
against
you
but
why
now
why
not
thousands
of
cycles
ago
and
why
virgil
samms
to
answer
those
questions
would
be
to
give
you
valuable
data
you
may
too
late
be
able
to
answer
them
yourself
but
to
continue
you
accuse
me
and
all
arisia
of
cowardice
an
evidently
muddy
and
inept
thought
reflect
please
upon
the
completeness
of
your
failure
in
the
affair
of
roger
planetoid
upon
the
fact
that
you
have
accomplished
nothing
whatever
since
that
time
upon
the
situation
in
which
you
now
find
yourself
even
though
the
trend
of
thought
of
your
race
is
basically
materialistic
and
mechanistic
and
you
belittle
ours
as
being
and
you
found
much
to
your
surprise
that
your
most
destructive
physical
agencies
are
not
able
to
affect
even
this
form
of
flesh
which
i
am
now
energizing
to
say
nothing
of
affecting
the
reality
which
is
i
if
this
episode
is
the
result
of
the
customary
thinking
of
the
of
eddore
innermost
circle
but
no
my
visualization
can
not
be
that
badly
at
fault
overconfidence
the
tyrant
innate
proclivity
to
underestimate
an
opponent
these
things
have
put
you
into
a
false
position
but
i
greatly
fear
that
they
will
not
operate
to
do
so
in
any
really
important
future
affair
rest
assured
that
they
will
not
gharlane
snarled
it
may
not
be
exactly
cowardice
it
is
however
something
closely
akin
if
you
could
have
acted
effectively
against
us
at
any
time
in
the
past
you
would
have
done
so
if
you
could
act
effectively
against
us
now
you
would
be
acting
not
talking
that
is
elementary
true
so
true
that
you
have
not
tried
to
deny
it
nor
would
you
expect
me
to
believe
you
if
you
did
cold
black
eyes
stared
level
into
icy
eyes
of
norwegian
blue
deny
it
no
i
am
glad
however
that
you
used
the
word
instead
of
for
we
have
been
acting
effectively
against
you
ever
since
these
planets
cooled
sufficiently
to
permit
of
the
development
of
intelligent
life
what
you
have
how
that
too
you
may
learn
too
late
i
have
now
said
all
i
intend
to
say
i
will
give
you
no
more
information
since
you
already
know
that
there
are
more
adult
arisians
than
there
are
eddorians
so
that
at
least
one
of
us
can
devote
his
full
attention
to
blocking
the
direct
effort
of
any
one
of
you
it
is
clear
to
you
that
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
you
elect
to
go
or
to
stay
i
can
and
i
will
remain
here
as
long
as
you
do
i
can
and
i
will
accompany
you
whenever
you
venture
out
of
the
volume
of
space
protected
by
eddorian
screen
wherever
you
go
the
election
is
yours
gharlane
disappeared
so
did
the
arisian
instantaneously
nels
bergenholm
however
remained
turning
he
resumed
his
work
where
he
had
left
off
knowing
exactly
what
he
had
been
doing
and
exactly
what
he
was
going
to
do
to
finish
it
he
released
the
zone
of
compulsion
which
he
had
been
holding
upon
every
human
being
within
sight
or
hearing
so
dexterously
that
no
one
suspected
then
or
ever
that
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
had
happened
he
knew
these
things
and
did
these
things
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
form
of
flesh
which
his
fellows
of
the
triplanetary
service
knew
as
nels
bergenholm
was
then
being
energized
not
by
the
stupendously
powerful
mind
of
drounli
the
molder
but
by
an
arisian
child
too
young
to
be
of
any
use
in
that
which
was
about
to
occur
arisia
was
ready
every
arisian
mind
capable
of
adult
or
of
even
thinking
was
poised
to
act
when
the
moment
of
action
should
come
they
were
not
however
tense
while
not
in
any
sense
routine
that
which
they
were
about
to
do
had
been
foreseen
for
many
cycles
of
time
they
knew
exactly
what
they
were
going
to
do
and
exactly
how
to
do
it
they
waited
my
visualization
is
not
entirely
clear
concerning
the
succession
of
events
stemming
from
the
fact
that
the
fusion
of
which
drounli
is
a
part
did
not
destroy
gharlane
of
eddore
while
he
was
energizing
gray
roger
a
young
watchman
eukonidor
by
symbol
thought
into
the
assembled
mind
may
i
take
a
moment
of
this
idle
time
in
which
to
spread
my
visualization
for
enlargement
and
instruction
you
may
youth
the
elders
of
arisia
the
mightiest
intellects
of
that
tremendously
powerful
race
fused
their
several
minds
into
one
mind
and
gave
approval
that
will
be
time
well
spent
think
on
separated
from
the
other
eddorians
by
distance
as
he
then
was
gharlane
could
have
been
isolated
and
could
have
been
destroyed
the
youth
pointed
out
as
he
somewhat
diffidently
spread
his
visualization
in
the
public
mind
since
it
is
axiomatic
that
his
destruction
would
have
weakened
eddore
somewhat
and
to
that
extent
would
have
helped
us
it
is
evident
that
some
greater
advantage
will
accrue
from
allowing
him
to
live
some
points
are
clear
enough
that
gharlane
and
his
fellows
will
believe
that
the
arisian
fusion
could
not
kill
him
since
it
did
not
that
the
eddorians
contemptuous
of
our
powers
and
thinking
us
vastly
their
inferiors
will
not
be
driven
to
develop
such
things
as
mechanical
screens
against
thought
until
such
a
time
as
it
will
be
too
late
for
even
those
devices
to
save
their
race
from
extinction
that
they
will
in
all
probability
never
even
suspect
that
the
galactic
patrol
which
is
so
soon
to
come
into
being
will
in
fact
be
the
prime
operator
in
that
extinction
it
is
not
clear
however
in
view
of
the
above
facts
why
it
has
now
become
necessary
for
us
to
slay
one
eddorian
upon
eddore
nor
can
i
formulate
or
visualize
with
any
clarity
the
techniques
to
be
employed
in
the
final
wiping
out
of
the
race
i
lack
certain
fundamental
data
concerning
events
which
occurred
and
conditions
which
obtained
many
many
cycles
before
my
birth
i
am
unable
to
believe
that
my
perception
and
memory
could
have
been
so
imperfect
can
it
be
that
none
of
that
basic
data
is
or
ever
has
been
available
that
youth
is
the
fact
while
your
visualization
of
the
future
is
of
course
not
as
detailed
nor
as
accurate
as
it
will
be
after
more
cycles
of
labor
your
background
of
knowledge
is
as
complete
as
that
of
any
other
of
our
number
i
see
eukonidor
gave
the
mental
equivalent
of
a
nod
of
complete
understanding
it
is
necessary
and
the
death
of
a
lesser
eddorian
a
watchman
will
be
sufficient
nor
will
it
be
either
surprising
or
alarming
to
eddore
innermost
circle
that
the
integrated
total
mind
of
arisia
should
be
able
to
kill
such
a
relatively
feeble
entity
i
see
then
silence
and
waiting
minutes
or
days
or
weeks
who
can
tell
what
does
time
mean
to
any
arisian
then
drounli
arrived
arrived
in
the
instant
of
his
leaving
the
hill
what
matters
even
distance
to
the
speed
of
thought
he
fused
his
mind
with
those
of
the
three
other
molders
of
civilization
the
massed
and
united
mind
of
arisia
poised
and
ready
awaiting
only
his
coming
launched
itself
through
space
that
tremendous
that
theretofore
unknown
concentration
of
mental
force
arrived
at
eddore
outer
screen
in
practically
the
same
instant
as
did
the
entity
that
was
gharlane
the
eddorian
however
went
through
without
opposition
the
arisians
did
not
some
two
thousand
million
years
ago
when
the
coalescence
occurred
the
event
which
was
to
make
each
of
the
two
interpassing
galaxies
teem
with
planets
the
arisians
were
already
an
ancient
race
so
ancient
that
they
were
even
then
independent
of
the
chance
formation
of
planets
the
eddorians
it
is
believed
were
older
still
the
arisians
were
native
to
this
our
normal
continuum
the
eddorians
were
not
eddore
was
and
is
huge
dense
and
hot
its
atmosphere
is
not
air
as
we
of
small
green
terra
know
air
but
is
a
noxious
mixture
of
gaseous
substances
known
to
mankind
only
in
chemical
laboratories
its
hydrosphere
while
it
does
contain
some
water
is
a
poisonous
stinking
foully
corrosive
slimy
and
sludgy
liquid
and
the
eddorians
were
as
different
from
any
people
we
know
as
eddore
is
different
from
the
planets
indigenous
to
our
space
and
time
they
were
to
our
senses
utterly
monstrous
almost
incomprehensible
they
were
amorphous
amoeboid
sexless
not
androgynous
or
parthenogenetic
but
absolutely
sexless
with
a
sexlessness
unknown
in
any
earthly
form
of
life
higher
than
the
yeasts
thus
they
were
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
except
for
death
by
violence
immortal
for
each
one
after
having
lived
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
tellurian
years
and
having
reached
its
capacity
to
live
and
to
learn
simply
divided
into
two
new
individuals
each
of
which
in
addition
to
possessing
in
full
its
parent
mind
and
memories
and
knowledges
had
also
a
zest
and
a
greatly
increased
capacity
and
since
life
was
there
had
been
competition
competition
for
power
knowledge
was
worth
while
only
insofar
as
it
contributed
to
power
warfare
began
and
aged
and
continued
the
appallingly
efficient
warfare
possible
only
to
such
entities
as
those
their
minds
already
immensely
powerful
grew
stronger
and
stronger
under
the
stresses
of
internecine
struggle
but
peace
was
not
even
thought
of
strife
continued
at
higher
and
even
higher
levels
of
violence
until
two
facts
became
apparent
first
that
every
eddorian
who
could
be
killed
by
physical
violence
had
already
died
that
the
survivors
had
developed
such
tremendous
powers
of
mind
such
complete
mastery
of
things
physical
as
well
as
mental
that
they
could
not
be
slain
by
physical
force
second
that
during
the
ages
through
which
they
had
been
devoting
their
every
effort
to
mutual
extermination
their
sun
had
begun
markedly
to
cool
that
their
planet
would
very
soon
become
so
cold
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
ever
again
to
live
their
normal
physical
lives
thus
there
came
about
an
armistice
the
eddorians
worked
together
not
without
friction
in
the
development
of
mechanisms
by
the
use
of
which
they
moved
their
planet
across
of
space
to
a
younger
hotter
sun
then
eddore
once
more
at
its
hot
and
reeking
norm
battle
was
resumed
mental
battle
this
time
that
went
on
for
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
eddorian
years
during
the
last
ten
thousand
of
which
not
a
single
eddorian
died
realizing
the
futility
of
such
unproductive
endeavor
the
relatively
few
survivors
made
a
peace
of
sorts
since
each
had
an
utterly
insatiable
lust
for
power
and
since
it
had
become
clear
that
they
could
neither
conquer
nor
kill
each
other
they
would
combine
forces
and
conquer
enough
planets
enough
galaxies
so
that
each
eddorian
could
have
as
much
power
and
authority
as
he
could
possibly
handle
what
matter
that
there
were
not
that
many
planets
in
their
native
space
there
were
other
spaces
an
infinite
number
of
them
some
of
which
it
was
mathematically
certain
would
contain
millions
upon
millions
of
planets
instead
of
only
two
or
three
by
mind
and
by
machine
they
surveyed
the
neighboring
continua
they
developed
the
tube
and
the
inertialess
drive
they
drove
their
planet
through
space
after
space
after
space
and
thus
shortly
after
the
coalescence
began
eddore
came
into
our
and
here
because
of
the
multitudes
of
planets
already
existing
and
the
untold
millions
more
about
to
come
into
existence
it
stayed
here
was
what
they
had
wanted
since
their
beginnings
here
were
planets
enough
here
were
fields
enough
for
the
exercise
of
power
to
sate
even
the
insatiable
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
them
to
fight
each
other
they
could
now
cooperate
as
long
as
each
was
getting
more
and
and
more
enphilisor
a
young
arisian
his
mind
roaming
eagerly
abroad
as
was
its
wont
made
first
contact
with
the
eddorians
in
this
space
inoffensive
naive
innocent
he
was
surprised
beyond
measure
at
their
reception
of
his
friendly
greeting
but
in
the
instant
before
closing
his
mind
to
their
vicious
attacks
he
learned
the
foregoing
facts
concerning
them
the
fused
mind
of
the
elders
of
arisia
however
was
not
surprised
the
arisians
while
not
as
mechanistic
as
their
opponents
and
innately
peaceful
as
well
were
far
ahead
of
them
in
the
pure
science
of
the
mind
the
elders
had
long
known
of
the
eddorians
and
of
their
lustful
wanderings
through
plenum
after
plenum
their
visualizations
of
the
cosmic
all
had
long
since
forecast
with
dreadful
certainty
the
invasion
which
had
now
occurred
they
had
long
known
what
they
would
have
to
do
they
did
it
so
insidiously
as
to
set
up
no
opposition
they
entered
the
eddorians
minds
and
sealed
off
all
knowledge
of
arisia
they
withdrew
tracelessly
they
did
not
have
much
data
it
is
true
but
no
more
could
be
obtained
at
that
time
if
any
one
of
those
touchy
suspicious
minds
had
been
given
any
cause
for
alarm
any
focal
point
of
doubt
they
would
have
had
time
in
which
to
develop
mechanisms
able
to
force
the
arisians
out
of
this
space
before
a
weapon
to
destroy
the
eddorians
the
as
yet
incompletely
designed
galactic
patrol
could
be
forged
the
arisians
could
even
then
have
slain
by
mental
force
alone
all
the
eddorians
except
the
and
his
innermost
circle
safe
within
their
then
impenetrable
shield
but
as
long
as
they
could
not
make
a
clean
sweep
they
could
not
attack
then
be
it
observed
that
the
arisians
were
not
fighting
for
themselves
as
individuals
or
as
a
race
they
had
nothing
to
fear
even
less
than
the
eddorians
could
they
be
killed
by
any
possible
application
of
physical
force
past
masters
of
mental
science
they
knew
that
no
possible
concentration
of
eddorian
mental
force
could
kill
any
one
of
them
and
if
they
were
to
be
forced
out
of
normal
space
what
matter
to
such
mentalities
as
theirs
any
given
space
would
serve
as
well
as
any
other
no
they
were
fighting
for
an
ideal
for
the
peaceful
harmonious
civilization
which
they
had
envisaged
as
developing
throughout
and
eventually
entirely
covering
the
myriads
of
planets
of
two
tremendous
island
universes
also
they
felt
a
heavy
weight
of
responsibility
since
all
these
races
existing
and
yet
to
appear
had
sprung
from
and
would
spring
from
the
arisian
which
permeated
this
particular
space
they
all
were
and
would
be
at
bottom
arisian
it
was
starkly
unthinkable
that
arisia
would
leave
them
to
the
eternal
dominance
of
such
a
rapacious
such
a
tyrannical
such
a
hellishly
insatiable
breed
of
monsters
therefore
the
arisians
fought
efficiently
if
insidiously
they
did
not
they
could
not
interfere
openly
with
eddore
ruthless
conquest
of
world
after
world
with
eddore
ruthless
smashing
of
civilization
after
civilization
they
did
however
see
to
it
by
selective
matings
and
the
establishment
of
upon
numberless
planets
that
the
trend
of
the
level
of
intelligence
was
definitely
and
steadily
upward
four
molders
of
civilization
drounli
kriedigan
nedanillor
and
brolenteen
who
in
fusion
formed
the
mentor
of
arisia
who
was
to
become
known
to
every
wearer
of
civilization
lens
were
individually
responsible
for
the
arisian
program
of
development
upon
the
four
planets
of
tellus
rigel
iv
velantia
and
palain
vii
drounli
established
upon
tellus
two
principal
lines
of
blood
in
unbroken
male
line
of
descent
the
kinnisons
went
back
to
long
before
the
dawn
of
even
mythical
tellurian
history
kinnexa
of
atlantis
daughter
of
one
kinnison
and
sister
of
another
is
the
first
of
the
blood
to
be
named
in
these
annals
but
the
line
was
then
already
old
so
was
the
other
line
characterized
throughout
its
tremendous
length
male
and
female
by
peculiarly
spectacular
hair
and
equally
striking
tawny
eyes
nor
did
these
strains
mix
drounli
had
made
it
psychologically
impossible
for
them
to
mix
until
the
penultimate
stage
of
development
should
have
been
reached
while
that
stage
was
still
in
the
future
virgil
samms
appeared
and
all
arisia
knew
that
the
time
had
come
to
engage
the
eddorians
openly
mind
to
mind
was
curbed
savagely
and
sharply
every
eddorian
wherever
he
was
working
found
his
every
line
of
endeavor
solidly
blocked
gharlane
as
has
been
intimated
constructed
a
supposedly
irresistible
weapon
and
attacked
his
arisian
blocker
with
results
already
told
at
that
failure
gharlane
knew
that
there
was
something
terribly
amiss
that
it
had
been
amiss
for
over
two
thousand
million
tellurian
years
really
alarmed
for
the
first
time
in
his
long
life
he
flashed
back
to
eddore
to
warn
his
fellows
and
to
take
counsel
with
them
as
to
what
should
be
done
and
the
massed
and
integrated
force
of
all
arisia
was
only
an
instant
behind
him
arisia
struck
eddore
outermost
screen
and
in
the
instant
of
impact
that
screen
went
down
and
then
instantaneously
and
all
unperceived
by
the
planet
defenders
the
arisian
forces
split
the
elders
including
all
the
molders
seized
the
eddorian
who
had
been
handling
that
screen
threw
around
him
an
impenetrable
net
of
force
yanked
him
out
into
space
then
driving
in
resistlessly
they
turned
the
luckless
wight
inside
out
and
before
the
victim
died
under
their
poignant
probings
the
elders
of
arisia
learned
everything
that
the
eddorian
and
all
of
his
ancestors
had
ever
known
they
then
withdrew
to
arisia
leaving
their
younger
weaker
fellows
to
do
whatever
they
could
against
mighty
eddore
whether
the
attack
of
these
lesser
forces
would
be
stopped
at
the
second
the
third
the
fourth
or
the
innermost
screen
whether
they
would
reach
the
planet
itself
and
perhaps
do
some
actual
damage
before
being
driven
off
was
immaterial
eddore
must
be
allowed
and
would
be
allowed
to
repel
that
invasion
with
ease
for
cycles
to
come
the
eddorians
must
and
would
believe
that
they
had
nothing
really
to
fear
from
arisia
the
real
battle
however
had
been
won
the
arisian
visualizations
could
now
be
extended
to
portray
every
essential
element
of
the
climactic
conflict
which
was
eventually
to
come
it
was
no
cheerful
conclusion
at
which
the
arisians
arrived
since
their
visualizations
all
agreed
in
showing
that
the
only
possible
method
of
wiping
out
the
eddorians
would
also
of
necessity
end
their
own
usefulness
as
guardians
of
civilization
such
an
outcome
having
been
shown
necessary
however
the
arisians
accepted
it
and
worked
toward
it
unhesitatingly
chapter
as
has
been
said
the
hill
which
had
been
built
to
be
the
tellurian
headquarters
of
the
triplanetary
service
and
which
was
now
the
headquarters
of
the
solarian
patrol
was
and
is
a
truncated
mountain
but
since
human
beings
do
not
like
to
live
eternally
underground
no
matter
how
beautifully
lighted
or
how
carefully
and
comfortably
the
dungeon
may
be
the
reservation
spread
far
beyond
the
foot
of
that
gray
forbidding
cone
of
metal
well
outside
that
farflung
reservation
there
was
a
small
city
there
were
hundreds
of
highly
productive
farms
and
particularly
upon
this
bright
may
afternoon
there
was
a
recreation
park
containing
among
other
things
dozens
of
tennis
courts
one
of
these
courts
was
enclosed
by
stands
from
which
a
couple
of
hundred
people
were
watching
a
match
which
seemed
to
be
of
some
little
local
importance
two
men
sat
in
a
box
which
had
seats
for
twenty
and
watched
admiringly
the
pair
who
seemed
in
a
fair
way
to
win
in
straight
sets
the
championship
of
the
hill
couple
rod
if
i
do
say
so
myself
as
well
as
being
smooth
performers
solarian
councillor
virgil
samms
spoke
to
his
companion
as
the
opponents
changed
courts
i
still
think
though
the
young
hussy
ought
to
wear
some
clothes
those
white
nylon
shorts
make
her
look
nakeder
even
than
usual
i
told
her
so
too
the
jade
but
she
keeps
on
wearing
less
and
less
of
course
commissioner
roderick
kinnison
laughed
quietly
what
did
you
expect
she
got
her
hair
and
eyes
from
you
why
not
your
too
one
thing
though
that
all
to
the
good
got
what
it
takes
to
strip
ship
that
way
and
most
of
have
but
what
i
ca
understand
is
why
they
do
he
paused
i
do
either
lord
knows
we
thrown
them
at
each
other
hard
enough
and
jack
kinnison
and
jill
samms
would
certainly
make
a
pair
to
draw
to
but
if
they
wo
but
maybe
they
will
yet
they
still
youngsters
and
they
friendly
enough
if
samms
père
could
have
been
out
on
the
court
however
instead
of
in
the
box
he
would
have
been
surprised
for
young
kinnison
although
smiling
enough
as
to
face
was
addressing
his
gorgeous
partner
in
terms
which
carried
little
indeed
of
friendliness
listen
you
he
stormed
voice
low
but
bitterly
intense
i
ought
to
beat
your
alleged
brains
out
i
told
you
a
thousand
times
to
watch
your
own
territory
and
out
of
if
you
had
been
where
you
belonged
or
even
taken
my
signal
frank
could
have
made
that
point
and
if
lois
had
netted
caught
you
a
kilometer
out
of
position
and
made
it
deuce
what
do
you
think
you
doing
anyway
playing
tennis
or
seeing
how
many
innocent
bystanders
you
can
bring
down
out
of
control
what
do
think
the
girl
sneered
sweetly
her
tawny
eyes
only
a
couple
of
inches
below
his
own
almost
emitted
sparks
and
just
look
at
who
trying
to
tell
who
how
to
do
what
for
your
information
master
pilot
john
kinnison
i
tell
you
that
just
because
you
ca
quit
being
kinnison
even
long
enough
to
let
two
good
friends
of
ours
get
a
point
now
and
then
or
maybe
even
a
game
is
no
reason
why
i
got
to
turn
into
samms
and
i
also
tell
you
you
tell
me
nothing
jill
i
telling
start
giving
away
points
in
anything
and
you
find
out
some
day
that
you
given
away
too
many
i
not
having
any
of
that
kind
of
game
and
as
long
as
you
playing
with
me
you
are
either
or
else
if
you
louse
up
this
match
just
once
more
the
next
ball
i
serve
will
hit
the
tightest
part
of
those
fancy
white
shorts
of
yours
right
where
the
hip
pocket
would
be
if
they
had
any
and
it
raise
a
welt
that
will
make
you
eat
off
of
the
mantel
for
three
days
so
watch
your
step
you
insufferable
lug
i
like
to
smash
this
racket
over
your
head
i
do
it
too
and
walk
off
the
court
if
you
do
the
whistle
blew
virgilia
samms
all
smiles
toed
the
and
became
the
personification
and
embodiment
of
smoothly
flowing
motion
the
ball
whizzed
over
the
net
barely
clearing
it
a
sizzling
service
ace
the
game
went
on
and
a
few
minutes
later
in
the
shower
room
where
jack
kinnison
was
caroling
lustily
while
plying
a
towel
a
huge
young
man
strode
up
and
slapped
him
ringingly
between
the
shoulder
blades
congratulations
jack
and
so
forth
but
there
a
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
confidential
sort
of
shoot
have
we
been
eating
out
of
the
same
dish
for
lo
these
many
moons
why
the
diffidence
all
of
a
sudden
mase
it
is
in
character
well
it
i
a
you
know
sure
we
all
are
what
of
it
it
only
that
well
i
saw
what
you
and
miss
samms
said
to
each
other
out
there
and
if
that
was
lovers
small
talk
i
a
venerian
who
the
hell
ever
said
we
were
lovers
oh
you
been
inhaling
some
of
dad
me
and
that
stinker
that
sapadilly
hold
it
jack
the
big
officer
voice
was
slightly
edged
you
off
course
a
hell
of
a
long
flit
off
that
girl
has
got
everything
she
the
class
of
the
reservation
why
she
a
regular
huh
amazed
young
kinnison
stopped
drying
himself
and
stared
you
mean
to
say
you
been
giving
her
a
miss
just
because
he
had
started
to
say
because
you
the
best
friend
i
got
in
the
system
but
he
did
not
well
it
would
have
smelled
slightly
cheesy
i
thought
the
other
man
did
not
put
into
words
either
what
both
of
them
so
deeply
knew
to
be
the
truth
but
if
you
have
got
if
it
with
you
of
course
stand
by
for
five
seconds
i
take
you
around
jack
threw
on
his
uniform
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
young
officers
immaculate
in
the
of
the
patrol
made
their
way
toward
the
women
dressing
rooms
but
she
all
right
at
that
in
most
ways
i
guess
kinnison
was
for
what
he
had
said
outside
of
being
and
she
a
good
egg
she
really
qualifies
most
of
the
time
but
i
would
have
her
bonus
attached
any
more
than
she
would
have
me
it
strictly
mutual
you
wo
fall
for
her
either
mase
you
want
to
pull
one
of
her
legs
off
and
beat
the
rest
of
her
to
death
with
it
inside
of
a
week
but
there
nothing
like
finding
things
out
for
yourself
in
a
short
time
miss
samms
appeared
dressed
somewhat
less
revealingly
than
before
in
the
blouse
and
kilts
which
were
the
mode
of
the
moment
hi
jill
this
is
mase
i
told
you
about
him
my
master
electronicist
mason
northrop
yes
i
heard
about
you
a
lot
she
shook
hands
warmly
he
has
been
putting
tracers
on
you
jill
on
accounta
he
figured
he
be
poaching
can
you
feature
that
i
straightened
him
out
though
in
short
order
told
him
why
too
so
he
ought
to
be
insulated
against
any
voltage
you
can
generate
oh
you
did
how
sweet
of
you
but
how
oh
those
she
gestured
at
the
powerful
prism
binoculars
a
part
of
the
uniform
of
every
officer
of
space
northrop
wriggled
but
held
firm
if
i
only
been
as
big
and
husky
as
you
are
surveying
admiringly
some
six
feet
two
of
altitude
and
two
pounds
of
hard
meat
gristle
and
bone
i
have
grabbed
him
by
one
ankle
whirled
him
around
my
head
and
flung
him
into
the
fifteenth
row
of
seats
what
the
matter
with
him
mase
is
that
he
was
born
centuries
and
centuries
too
late
he
should
have
been
an
overseer
when
they
built
the
pyramids
flogging
slaves
because
they
would
step
just
so
or
better
yet
one
of
those
people
it
told
about
in
those
funny
old
books
they
dug
up
last
year
liege
lords
or
something
like
that
remember
with
the
power
of
life
and
death
middle
and
low
justice
whatever
that
was
over
their
vassals
and
their
families
serfs
and
he
likes
little
cuddly
who
pretend
to
be
utterly
spineless
and
completely
brainless
eh
jack
ouch
touché
jill
but
maybe
i
had
it
coming
to
me
at
that
call
it
off
shall
we
i
be
seeing
you
two
hither
or
yon
kinnison
turned
and
hurried
away
want
to
know
why
he
doing
such
a
quick
flit
jill
grinned
up
at
her
companion
a
bright
quick
grin
not
that
he
was
giving
up
the
blonde
over
there
the
one
in
rocket
red
very
few
blondes
can
wear
such
a
violent
shade
dimples
maynard
and
is
she
er
cuddly
and
she
a
grand
person
i
was
just
popping
off
so
was
he
you
know
that
neither
of
us
really
meant
half
of
what
we
said
or
at
least
her
voice
died
away
i
do
know
whether
i
do
or
not
northrop
replied
awkwardly
but
honestly
that
was
savage
stuff
if
there
ever
was
any
i
ca
see
for
the
life
of
me
why
you
two
two
of
the
world
finest
people
should
have
to
tear
into
each
other
that
way
do
you
i
do
know
that
i
ever
thought
of
it
like
that
jill
caught
her
lower
lip
between
her
teeth
he
splendid
really
and
i
like
him
a
lot
usually
we
get
along
perfectly
most
of
the
time
we
do
fight
at
all
except
when
we
too
close
together
and
then
we
fight
about
anything
and
everything
say
suppose
that
that
could
be
it
like
charges
repelling
each
other
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
that
about
the
way
it
seems
to
be
could
be
and
i
glad
the
man
face
cleared
and
i
a
charge
of
the
opposite
sign
let
go
and
in
virgil
samms
office
civilization
two
strongest
men
were
deep
in
conversation
troubles
enough
to
keep
four
men
of
our
size
awake
nights
samms
voice
was
light
but
his
eyes
were
moody
and
somber
you
can
probably
whip
yours
though
in
time
they
mostly
in
one
solar
system
a
short
flit
covers
the
rest
languages
and
customs
are
known
but
how
can
legal
processes
work
efficiently
work
at
all
for
that
matter
when
a
man
can
commit
a
murder
or
a
pirate
can
loot
a
and
be
a
hundred
parsecs
away
before
the
crime
is
even
discovered
how
can
a
tellurian
john
law
find
a
criminal
on
a
strange
world
that
knows
nothing
whatever
of
our
patrol
with
a
completely
alien
language
maybe
no
language
at
all
where
it
takes
months
even
to
find
out
who
and
where
if
any
the
native
police
officers
are
but
there
must
be
a
way
rod
there
to
be
a
way
samms
slammed
his
open
hand
resoundingly
against
his
desk
bare
top
and
by
god
find
it
the
patrol
come
out
on
top
samms
now
and
forever
there
was
no
trace
of
mockery
in
kinnison
voice
or
expression
but
only
friendship
and
admiration
and
i
bet
you
do
your
interstellar
patrol
or
whatever
galactic
patrol
i
know
what
the
name
of
it
is
going
to
be
if
nothing
else
is
just
as
good
as
in
the
bag
right
now
you
done
a
job
so
far
virge
this
whole
system
nevia
the
colonies
on
aldebaran
ii
and
other
planets
even
valeria
as
tight
as
a
drum
funny
about
valeria
is
it
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
kinnison
went
on
but
wherever
diamonds
are
there
go
dutchmen
and
dutch
women
go
wherever
their
men
do
and
in
spite
of
medical
advice
dutch
babies
arrive
although
a
lot
of
the
adults
died
three
g
is
no
joke
practically
all
of
the
babies
keep
on
living
developing
bones
and
muscles
to
fit
walking
at
a
year
and
a
half
old
living
normally
they
say
that
the
third
generation
will
be
perfectly
at
home
there
which
shows
that
the
human
animal
is
more
adaptable
than
some
ranking
medicos
had
believed
is
all
do
try
to
me
rod
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
what
we
up
against
the
new
headaches
that
commerce
is
bringing
with
it
new
vices
drugs
thionite
for
instance
we
have
been
able
to
get
an
inkling
of
an
idea
as
to
where
that
stuff
is
coming
from
and
i
do
have
to
tell
you
what
piracy
has
done
to
insurance
rates
i
say
not
look
at
the
price
of
aldebaranian
cigars
the
only
kind
fit
to
smoke
you
given
up
then
on
the
idea
that
arisia
is
the
pirates
ghq
definitely
it
is
the
pirates
are
even
more
afraid
of
it
than
tramp
spacemen
are
it
out
of
bounds
absolutely
forbidden
territory
apparently
to
everybody
my
best
operatives
included
all
we
know
about
it
is
the
name
arisia
that
our
planetographers
gave
it
it
is
the
first
completely
incomprehensible
thing
i
have
ever
experienced
i
am
going
out
there
myself
as
soon
as
i
can
take
the
time
not
that
i
expect
to
crack
a
thing
that
my
best
men
could
touch
but
there
have
been
so
many
different
and
conflicting
reports
no
two
stories
agree
on
anything
except
in
that
no
one
could
get
anywhere
near
the
planet
that
i
feel
the
need
of
some
information
want
to
come
along
try
to
keep
me
from
it
but
at
that
we
should
be
too
surprised
samms
went
on
thoughtfully
just
beginning
to
scratch
the
surface
as
we
are
we
should
expect
to
encounter
peculiar
baffling
even
completely
inexplicable
things
facts
situations
events
and
beings
for
which
our
experience
could
not
possibly
have
prepared
us
in
fact
we
already
have
if
ten
years
ago
anyone
had
told
you
that
such
a
race
as
the
rigellians
existed
what
would
you
have
thought
one
ship
went
there
you
know
once
one
hour
in
any
rigellian
city
one
minute
in
a
rigellian
automobile
drives
a
tellurian
insane
i
see
your
point
kinnison
nodded
probably
i
would
have
ordered
a
mental
examination
and
the
palainians
are
even
worse
people
if
you
can
call
them
that
who
live
on
pluto
and
it
entities
so
alien
that
nobody
as
far
as
i
know
understands
them
but
you
have
to
go
even
that
far
from
home
to
locate
a
job
of
unscrewing
the
inscrutable
who
what
and
why
and
for
how
long
was
gray
roger
and
not
far
behind
him
is
this
young
bergenholm
of
yours
and
by
the
way
you
never
did
give
me
the
lowdown
on
how
come
it
was
the
and
not
the
that
made
commerce
possible
and
caused
of
our
headaches
as
i
get
the
story
bergenholm
was
is
even
an
engineer
did
i
thought
i
did
he
was
and
is
well
the
original
free
drive
was
a
killer
you
know
i
know
kinnison
exclaimed
feelingly
they
beat
their
brains
out
and
ate
their
hearts
out
for
months
without
getting
it
any
better
then
one
day
this
kid
bergenholm
ambles
into
their
shop
big
awkward
stumbling
over
his
own
feet
he
gazes
innocently
at
the
thing
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
says
do
you
use
uranium
instead
of
iron
and
rewind
it
so
it
will
put
out
a
like
this
with
humps
here
and
here
instead
of
there
and
there
and
he
draws
a
couple
of
but
really
beautiful
curves
should
we
they
squawk
at
him
it
will
work
that
way
he
says
and
ambles
out
as
unconcernedly
as
he
came
in
ca
or
wo
say
another
word
well
in
sheer
desperation
they
tried
it
and
it
worked
and
nobody
has
ever
had
a
minute
trouble
with
a
bergenholm
since
that
why
rodebush
and
cleveland
both
insisted
on
the
name
i
see
and
it
points
up
what
i
just
said
but
if
he
such
a
mental
giant
why
is
he
getting
results
with
his
own
problem
the
meteor
or
is
he
no
or
at
least
he
was
as
of
last
night
but
there
a
note
on
my
pad
that
he
wants
to
see
me
sometime
today
suppose
we
have
him
come
in
now
fine
i
like
to
talk
to
him
if
it
with
you
and
with
him
the
young
scientist
was
called
in
and
was
introduced
to
the
commissioner
go
ahead
doctor
bergenholm
samms
suggested
then
you
may
talk
to
both
of
us
just
as
freely
as
though
you
and
i
were
alone
i
have
as
you
already
know
been
called
psychic
bergenholm
began
abruptly
it
is
said
that
i
dream
dreams
see
visions
hear
voices
and
so
on
that
i
operate
on
hunches
that
i
am
a
genius
now
i
very
definitely
am
a
genius
unless
my
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
that
word
is
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
mankind
bergenholm
paused
samms
and
kinnison
looked
at
each
other
the
latter
broke
the
short
silence
the
councillor
and
i
have
just
been
discussing
the
fact
that
there
are
a
great
many
things
we
do
not
know
that
with
the
extension
of
our
activities
into
new
fields
the
occurrence
of
the
impossible
has
become
almost
a
commonplace
we
are
able
i
believe
to
listen
with
open
minds
to
anything
you
have
to
say
very
well
but
first
please
know
that
i
am
a
scientist
as
such
i
am
trained
to
observe
to
think
calmly
clearly
and
analytically
to
test
every
hypothesis
i
do
not
believe
at
all
in
the
supernatural
this
universe
did
not
come
into
being
it
does
not
continue
to
be
except
by
the
operation
of
natural
and
immutable
laws
and
i
mean
gentlemen
everything
that
has
ever
happened
that
is
happening
now
or
that
ever
is
to
happen
was
is
and
will
be
statistically
connected
with
its
predecessor
event
and
with
its
successor
event
if
i
did
not
believe
that
implicitly
i
would
lose
all
faith
in
the
scientific
method
for
if
one
single
event
or
thing
had
ever
occurred
or
existed
it
would
have
constituted
an
entirely
unpredictable
event
and
would
have
initiated
a
series
a
succession
of
such
events
a
state
of
things
which
no
scientist
will
or
can
believe
possible
in
an
orderly
universe
at
the
same
time
i
recognize
the
fact
that
i
myself
have
done
things
caused
events
to
occur
if
you
prefer
that
i
can
not
explain
to
you
or
to
any
other
human
being
in
any
symbology
known
to
our
science
and
it
is
about
an
even
more
inexplicable
call
it
if
you
like
that
i
asked
to
have
a
talk
with
you
today
but
you
are
arguing
in
circles
samms
protested
or
are
you
trying
to
set
up
a
paradox
neither
i
am
merely
clearing
the
way
for
a
somewhat
startling
thing
i
am
to
say
later
on
you
know
of
course
that
any
situation
with
which
a
mind
is
unable
to
cope
a
really
serious
dilemma
which
it
can
not
resolve
will
destroy
that
mind
frustration
escape
from
reality
and
so
on
you
also
will
realize
that
i
must
have
become
cognizant
of
my
own
peculiarities
long
before
anyone
else
did
or
could
ah
i
see
yes
of
course
samms
intensely
interested
leaned
forward
yet
your
present
personality
is
adequately
splendidly
integrated
how
could
you
possibly
have
overcome
reconciled
a
situation
so
full
of
conflict
you
are
i
think
familiar
with
my
parentage
samms
keen
as
he
was
did
not
consider
it
noteworthy
that
the
big
norwegian
answered
his
question
only
by
asking
one
of
his
own
yes
oh
i
beginning
to
see
but
commissioner
kinnison
has
not
had
access
to
your
dossier
go
ahead
my
father
is
hjalmar
bergenholm
my
mother
before
her
marriage
was
olga
bjornson
both
were
and
are
nuclear
physicists
very
good
ones
pioneers
they
have
been
called
they
worked
and
are
still
working
in
the
newest
outermost
fringes
of
the
field
oh
kinnison
exclaimed
a
mutant
born
with
second
sight
or
whatever
it
is
not
second
sight
as
history
describes
the
phenomenon
no
the
records
do
not
show
that
any
such
faculty
was
ever
demonstrated
to
the
satisfaction
of
any
competent
scientific
investigator
what
i
have
is
something
else
whether
or
not
it
will
breed
true
is
an
interesting
topic
of
speculation
but
one
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
now
in
hand
to
return
to
the
subject
i
resolved
my
dilemma
long
since
there
is
i
am
absolutely
certain
a
science
of
the
mind
which
is
as
definite
as
positive
as
immutable
of
law
as
is
the
science
of
the
physical
while
i
will
make
no
attempt
to
prove
it
to
you
i
that
such
a
science
exists
and
that
i
was
born
with
the
ability
to
perceive
at
least
some
elements
of
it
now
to
the
matter
of
the
meteor
of
the
patrol
that
emblem
was
and
is
purely
physical
the
pirates
have
just
as
able
scientists
as
we
have
what
physical
science
can
devise
and
synthesize
physical
science
can
analyze
and
duplicate
there
is
a
point
however
beyond
which
physical
science
can
not
go
it
can
neither
analyze
nor
imitate
the
tangible
products
of
that
which
i
have
so
loosely
called
the
science
of
the
mind
i
know
councillor
samms
what
the
triplanetary
service
needs
something
vastly
more
than
its
meteor
i
also
know
that
the
need
will
become
greater
and
greater
as
the
sphere
of
action
of
the
patrol
expands
without
a
really
efficient
symbol
the
solarian
patrol
will
be
hampered
even
more
than
the
triplanetary
service
and
its
logical
extension
into
the
space
patrol
or
whatever
that
larger
organization
may
be
called
will
be
definitely
impossible
we
need
something
which
will
identify
any
representative
of
civilization
positively
and
unmistakably
wherever
he
may
be
it
must
be
impossible
of
duplication
or
even
of
imitation
to
which
end
it
must
kill
any
unauthorized
entity
who
attempts
imposture
it
must
operate
as
a
telepath
between
its
owner
and
any
other
living
intelligence
of
however
high
or
low
degree
so
that
mental
communication
so
much
clearer
and
faster
than
physical
will
be
possible
without
the
laborious
learning
of
language
or
between
us
and
such
peoples
as
those
of
rigel
four
or
of
palain
seven
both
of
whom
we
know
to
be
of
high
intelligence
and
who
must
already
be
conversant
with
telepathy
are
you
or
have
you
been
reading
my
mind
samms
asked
quietly
no
bergenholm
replied
flatly
it
is
not
and
has
not
been
necessary
any
man
who
can
think
who
has
really
considered
the
question
and
who
has
the
good
of
civilization
at
heart
must
have
come
to
the
same
conclusions
probably
so
at
that
but
no
more
side
issues
you
have
a
solution
of
some
kind
worked
out
or
you
would
not
be
here
what
is
it
it
is
that
you
solarian
councillor
samms
should
go
to
arisia
as
soon
as
possible
arisia
samms
exclaimed
and
arisia
of
all
the
hells
in
space
why
arisia
and
how
can
we
make
the
approach
do
you
know
that
can
get
anywhere
near
that
damn
planet
bergenholm
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
both
arms
wide
in
a
pantomime
of
complete
helplessness
how
do
you
know
another
of
your
hunches
kinnison
went
on
or
did
somebody
tell
you
something
did
you
get
it
it
is
not
a
hunch
the
norwegian
replied
positively
no
one
told
me
anything
but
i
as
definitely
as
i
know
that
the
combustion
of
hydrogen
in
oxygen
will
yield
water
that
the
arisians
are
very
well
versed
in
that
which
i
have
called
the
science
of
the
mind
that
if
virgil
samms
goes
to
arisia
he
will
obtain
the
symbol
he
needs
that
he
will
never
obtain
it
otherwise
as
to
i
know
these
things
i
ca
i
just
i
it
i
tell
you
without
another
word
without
asking
permission
to
leave
bergenholm
whirled
around
and
hurried
out
samms
and
kinnison
stared
at
each
other
well
kinnison
asked

i
going

whether
i
can
be

not

you

i
out

not

every

besides
there
the
bergenholm
how
about
you
coming
yes
ca
say
that
i
sold
one
hundred
percent
but
as
you
say
the
bergenholm
is
a
hard
fact
to
shrug
off
and
at
minimum
rating
it
got
to
be
tried
what
are
you
taking
not

probably

went
inert
and
crept
forward
mile
by

every
man
from
commissioner
and
councillor
down
was
taut
and
tense
so
widely
variant
so
utterly
fantastic
were
the
stories
going
around
about
this
arisia
that
no
one
knew
what
to
expect
they
expected
the
unexpected
and
got

tellurians

virgil
samms
will
now
be
interviewed
he
will
return
to
the
consciousnesses
of
the
rest
of
you
in
exactly
six
of
your
hours
practically
dazed
by
the
shock
of
their
first
experience
with
telepathy
not
one
of
the
crew
perceived
anything
unusual
in
the
phraseology
of
that
utterly
precise
thought
samms
and
kinnison
however
precisionists
themselves
did
but
warned
although
they
were
and
keyed
up
although
they
were
to
detect
any
sign
of
hypnotism
or
of
mental
suggestion
neither
of
them
had
the
faintest
suspicion
then
or
ever
that
virgil
samms
did
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
leave
the
at
all
samms
that
he
boarded
a
lifeboat
and
drove
it
toward
the
shimmering
haze
beyond
which
arisia
was
commissioner
kinnison
as
surely
as
did
every
other
man
aboard
that
samms
did
those
things
because
he
and
the
other
officers
and
most
of
the
crew
watched
samms
do
them
they
watched
the
lifeboat
dwindle
in
size
with
distance
watched
it
disappear
within
the
peculiarly
iridescent
veil
of
force
which
their
most
penetrant
could
not
pierce
they
waited
and
since
every
man
concerned
beyond
any
shadow
of
doubt
and
to
the
end
of
his
life
that
everything
that
seemed
to
happen
actually
did
happen
it
will
be
so
described
virgil
samms
then
drove
his
small
vessel
through
arisia
innermost
screen
and
saw
a
planet
so
much
like
earth
that
it
might
have
been
her
sister
world
there
were
the
white
the
immense
blue
oceans
the
verdant
continents
partially
obscured
by
fleecy
banks
of
cloud
would
there
or
would
there
not
be
cities
while
he
had
not
known
at
all
exactly
what
to
expect
he
did
not
believe
that
there
would
be
any
large
cities
upon
arisia
to
qualify
for
the
role
of
ex
the
arisian
with
whom
samms
was
about
to
deal
would
have
to
be
a
indeed
a
being
completely
beyond
man
knowledge
or
experience
in
power
of
mind
would
such
a
race
of
beings
have
need
of
such
things
as
cities
they
would
not
there
would
be
no
cities
nor
were
there
the
lifeboat
flashed
downward
slowed
landed
smoothly
in
a
regulation
dock
upon
the
outskirts
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
village
surrounded
by
farms
and
woods
this
way
please
an
inaudible
voice
directed
him
toward
a
vehicle
which
was
almost
but
not
quite
like
a
dillingham
roadster
this
car
however
took
off
by
itself
as
soon
as
samms
closed
the
door
it
sped
smoothly
along
a
paved
highway
devoid
of
all
other
traffic
past
farms
and
past
cottages
to
stop
of
itself
in
front
of
the
low
massive
structure
which
was
the
center
of
the
village
and
apparently
its
reason
for
being
this
way
please
and
samms
went
through
an
door
along
a
short
bare
hall
into
a
fairly
large
central
room
containing
a
vat
and
one
chair
sit
down
please
samms
did
so
gratefully
he
did
not
know
whether
he
could
have
stood
up
much
longer
or
not
he
had
expected
to
encounter
a
tremendous
mentality
but
this
was
a
thing
far
far
beyond
his
wildest
imaginings
this
was
a
brain
just
that
nothing
else
almost
globular
at
least
ten
feet
in
diameter
immersed
in
and
in
perfect
equilibrium
with
a
pleasantly
aromatic
liquid
a
brain
relax
the
arisian
ordered
soothingly
and
samms
found
that
he
relax
through
the
one
you
know
as
bergenholm
i
heard
of
your
need
and
have
permitted
you
to
come
here
this
once
for
instruction
but
this
none
of
this
it
is
it
be
real
samms
blurted
i
am
i
must
be
imagining
it
and
yet
i
know
that
i
be
hypnotized
i
been
psychoed
against
it
what
is
reality
the
arisian
asked
quietly
your
profoundest
thinkers
have
never
been
able
to
answer
that
question
nor
although
i
am
much
older
and
a
much
more
capable
thinker
than
any
member
of
your
race
would
i
attempt
to
give
you
its
true
answer
nor
since
your
experience
has
been
so
limited
is
it
to
be
expected
that
you
could
believe
without
reservation
any
assurances
i
might
give
you
in
thoughts
or
in
words
you
must
then
convince
yourself
definitely
by
means
of
your
own
five
senses
that
i
and
everything
about
you
are
real
as
you
understand
reality
you
saw
the
village
and
this
building
you
see
the
flesh
that
houses
the
entity
which
is
i
you
feel
your
own
flesh
as
you
tap
the
woodwork
with
your
knuckles
you
feel
the
impact
and
hear
the
vibrations
as
sound
as
you
entered
this
room
you
must
have
perceived
the
odor
of
the
nutrient
solution
in
which
and
by
virtue
of
which
i
live
there
remains
only
the
sense
of
taste
are
you
by
any
chance
either
hungry
or
thirsty
both
drink
of
the
tankard
in
the
niche
yonder
in
order
to
avoid
any
appearance
of
suggestion
i
will
tell
you
nothing
of
its
content
except
the
one
fact
that
it
matches
perfectly
the
chemistry
of
your
tissues
gingerly
enough
samms
brought
the
pitcher
to
his
lips
then
seizing
it
in
both
hands
he
gulped
down
a
tremendous
draught
it
was
good
it
smelled
like
all
appetizing
kitchen
aromas
blended
into
one
it
tasted
like
all
of
the
most
delicious
meals
he
had
ever
eaten
it
quenched
his
thirst
as
no
beverage
had
ever
done
but
he
could
not
empty
even
that
comparatively
small
container
whatever
the
stuff
was
it
had
a
satiety
value
immensely
higher
even
than
old
rare
roast
beef
with
a
sigh
of
repletion
samms
replaced
the
tankard
and
turned
again
to
his
peculiar
host
i
am
convinced
that
was
real
no
possible
mental
influence
could
so
completely
and
unmistakably
satisfy
the
purely
physical
demands
of
a
body
as
hungry
and
as
thirsty
as
mine
was
thanks
immensely
for
allowing
me
to
come
here
mr
you
may
call
me
mentor
i
have
no
name
as
you
understand
the
term
now
then
please
think
fully
you
need
not
speak
of
your
problems
and
of
your
difficulties
of
what
you
have
done
and
of
what
you
have
it
in
mind
to
do
samms
thought
flashingly
and
cogently
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
cover
triplanetary
history
and
the
beginning
of
the
solarian
patrol
then
for
almost
three
hours
he
went
into
the
ramifications
of
the
galactic
patrol
of
his
imaginings
finally
he
wrenched
himself
back
to
reality
he
jumped
up
paced
the
floor
and
spoke
but
there
a
vital
flaw
one
inherent
and
absolutely
ruinous
fact
that
makes
the
whole
thing
impossible
he
burst
out
rebelliously
no
one
man
or
group
of
men
no
matter
who
they
are
can
be
trusted
with
that
much
power
the
council
and
i
have
already
been
called
everything
imaginable
and
what
we
have
done
so
far
is
literally
nothing
at
all
in
comparison
with
what
the
galactic
patrol
could
and
must
do
why
i
myself
would
be
the
first
to
protest
against
the
granting
of
such
power
to
every
dictator
in
history
from
philip
of
macedon
to
the
tyrant
of
asia
claimed
to
be
and
probably
was
in
his
beginnings
motivated
solely
by
benevolence
how
am
i
to
think
that
the
proposed
galactic
council
or
even
i
myself
will
be
strong
enough
to
conquer
a
thing
that
has
corrupted
utterly
every
man
who
has
ever
won
it
who
is
to
watch
the
watchmen
the
thought
does
you
credit
youth
mentor
replied
unmoved
that
is
one
reason
why
you
are
here
you
of
your
own
force
can
not
know
that
you
are
in
fact
incorruptible
i
however
know
moreover
there
is
an
agency
by
virtue
of
which
that
which
you
now
believe
to
be
impossible
will
become
commonplace
extend
your
arm
samms
did
so
and
there
snapped
around
his
wrist
a
bracelet
carrying
a
lenticular
something
at
which
the
tellurian
stared
in
stupefied
amazement
it
seemed
to
be
composed
of
thousands
millions
of
tiny
gems
each
of
which
emitted
pulsatingly
all
the
colors
of
the
spectrum
it
was
throwing
out
broadcasting
a
turbulent
flood
of
writhing
polychromatic
light
the
successor
to
the
golden
meteor
of
the
triplanetary
service
mentor
said
calmly
the
lens
of
arisia
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
until
your
own
experience
shall
have
convinced
you
of
the
fact
that
no
one
will
ever
wear
arisia
lens
who
is
in
any
sense
unworthy
here
also
is
one
for
your
friend
commissioner
kinnison
it
is
not
necessary
for
him
to
come
physically
to
arisia
it
is
you
will
observe
in
an
insulated
container
and
does
not
glow
touch
its
surface
but
lightly
and
very
fleetingly
for
the
contact
will
be
painful
samms
barely
touched
one
dull
gray
lifeless
jewel
his
whole
arm
jerked
away
uncontrollably
as
there
swept
through
his
whole
being
the
intimation
of
an
agony
more
poignant
by
far
than
any
he
had
ever
known
why
it
he
gasped
no
it
is
not
really
alive
as
you
understand
the
term
mentor
paused
as
though
seeking
a
way
to
describe
to
the
tellurian
a
thing
which
was
to
him
starkly
incomprehensible
it
is
however
endowed
with
what
you
might
call
a
sort
of
by
virtue
of
which
it
gives
off
its
characteristic
radiation
while
and
only
while
it
is
in
physical
circuit
with
the
living
entity
the
ego
let
us
say
with
whom
it
is
in
exact
resonance
glowing
the
lens
is
perfectly
harmless
it
is
complete
saturated
satiated
fulfilled
in
the
dark
condition
it
is
as
you
have
learned
dangerous
in
the
extreme
it
is
then
incomplete
unfulfilled
frustrated
you
might
say
seeking
or
yearning
or
demanding
in
that
condition
its
interferes
so
strongly
with
any
life
to
which
it
is
not
attuned
that
that
life
in
a
space
of
seconds
is
forced
out
of
this
plane
or
cycle
of
existence
then
i
i
alone
of
all
the
entities
in
existence
can
wear
this
particular
lens
samms
licked
his
lips
and
stared
at
it
glowing
so
satisfyingly
and
contentedly
upon
his
wrist
but
when
i
die
will
it
be
a
perpetual
menace
by
no
means
a
lens
can
not
be
brought
into
being
except
to
match
some
one
living
personality
a
short
time
after
you
pass
into
the
next
cycle
your
lens
will
disintegrate
wonderful
samms
breathed
in
awe
but
there
one
thing
these
things
are
priceless
and
there
will
be
millions
of
them
to
make
and
you
do
what
will
we
get
out
of
it
you
mean
the
arisian
seemed
to
smile
exactly
samms
blushed
but
held
his
ground
nobody
does
anything
for
nothing
altruism
is
beautiful
in
theory
but
it
has
never
been
known
to
work
in
practice
i
will
pay
a
tremendous
price
any
price
within
reason
or
possibility
for
the
lens
but
i
will
have
to
know
what
that
price
is
to
be
it
will
be
heavier
than
you
think
or
can
at
present
realize
although
not
in
the
sense
you
fear
mentor
thought
was
solemnity
itself
whoever
wears
the
lens
of
arisia
will
carry
a
load
that
no
weaker
mind
could
bear
the
load
of
authority
of
responsibility
of
knowledge
that
would
wreck
completely
any
mind
of
lesser
strength
altruism
no
nor
is
it
a
case
of
good
against
evil
as
you
so
firmly
believe
your
mental
picture
of
glaring
white
and
of
unrelieved
black
is
not
a
true
picture
neither
absolute
evil
nor
absolute
good
do
or
can
exist
but
that
would
make
it
still
worse
samms
protested
in
that
case
i
ca
see
any
reason
at
all
for
your
exerting
yourselves
putting
yourselves
out
for
us
there
is
however
reason
enough
although
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
make
it
as
clear
to
you
as
i
would
wish
there
are
in
fact
three
reasons
any
one
of
which
would
justify
us
in
exerting
would
compel
us
to
exert
the
trivial
effort
involved
in
the
furnishing
of
lenses
to
your
galactic
patrol
first
there
is
nothing
either
intrinsically
right
or
intrinsically
wrong
about
liberty
or
slavery
democracy
or
autocracy
freedom
of
action
or
complete
regimentation
it
seems
to
us
however
that
the
greatest
measure
of
happiness
and
of
for
the
greatest
number
of
entities
and
therefore
the
optimum
advancement
toward
whatever
sublime
goal
it
is
toward
which
this
cycle
of
existence
is
trending
in
the
vast
and
unknowable
scheme
of
things
is
to
be
obtained
by
securing
for
each
and
every
individual
the
greatest
amount
of
mental
and
physical
freedom
compatible
with
the
public
welfare
we
of
arisia
are
only
a
small
part
of
this
cycle
and
as
goes
the
whole
so
goes
in
greater
or
lesser
degree
each
of
the
parts
is
it
impossible
for
you
a
fellow
citizen
of
this
to
believe
that
such
fulfillment
alone
would
be
ample
compensation
for
a
much
greater
effort
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
light
it
was
hard
for
samms
to
grasp
the
concept
he
never
did
understand
it
thoroughly
i
begin
to
see
i
think
at
least
i
believe
you
second
we
have
a
more
specific
obligation
in
that
the
life
of
many
many
worlds
has
sprung
from
arisian
seed
thus
loco
we
would
be
derelict
indeed
if
we
refused
to
act
and
third
you
yourself
spend
highly
valuable
time
and
much
effort
in
playing
chess
why
do
you
do
it
what
do
you
get
out
of
it
why
i
uh
mental
exercise
i
suppose
i
like
it
just
so
and
i
am
sure
that
one
of
your
very
early
philosophers
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
fully
competent
mind
from
a
study
of
one
fact
or
artifact
belonging
to
any
given
universe
could
construct
or
visualize
that
universe
from
the
instant
of
its
creation
to
its
ultimate
end
yes
at
least
i
have
heard
the
proposition
stated
but
i
have
never
believed
it
possible
it
is
not
possible
simply
because
no
fully
competent
mind
ever
has
existed
or
ever
will
exist
a
mind
can
become
fully
competent
only
by
the
acquisition
of
infinite
knowledge
which
would
require
infinite
time
as
well
as
infinite
capacity
our
equivalent
of
your
chess
however
is
what
we
call
the
of
the
cosmic
all
in
my
visualization
a
descendant
of
yours
named
clarrissa
macdougall
will
in
a
store
called
brenleer
upon
the
planet
but
no
let
us
consider
a
thing
nearer
at
hand
and
concerning
you
personally
so
that
its
accuracy
will
be
subject
to
check
where
you
will
be
and
exactly
what
you
will
be
doing
at
some
definite
time
in
the
future
five
years
let
us
say
go
ahead
if
you
can
do
that
you
five
tellurian
calendar
years
then
from
the
instant
of
your
passing
through
the
screen
of
hill
on
this
present
journey
you
will
be
allow
me
please
a
moment
of
thought
you
will
be
in
a
barber
shop
not
yet
built
the
address
of
which
is

tellus
the
barber
name
will
be
antonio
carbonero
and
he
will
be
he
will
be
engaged
in
cutting
your
hair
or
rather
the
actual
cutting
will
have
been
done
and
he
will
be
shaving
with
a
razor
the
short
hairs
in
front
of
your
left
ear
a
comparatively
small
quadrupedal
entity
of
the
race
called
a
young
cat
this
one
will
be
and
called
thomas
although
actually
of
the
female
sex
will
jump
into
your
lap
addressing
you
pleasantly
in
a
language
with
which
you
yourself
are
only
partially
familiar
you
call
it
mewing
and
purring
i
believe
yes
the
flabbergasted
samms
managed
to
say
cats
do
purr
especially
kittens
ah
very
good
never
having
met
a
cat
personally
i
am
gratified
at
your
corroboration
of
my
visualization
this
female
youth
erroneously
called
thomas
somewhat
careless
in
computing
the
elements
of
her
trajectory
will
jostle
slightly
the
barber
elbow
with
her
tail
thus
causing
him
to
make
a
slight
incision
approximately
three
millimeters
long
parallel
to
and
just
above
your
left
at
the
precise
moment
in
question
the
barber
will
be
applying
a
styptic
pencil
to
this
insignificant
wound
this
forecast
is
i
trust
sufficiently
detailed
so
that
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
checking
its
accuracy
or
its
lack
thereof
detailed
samms
could
scarcely
think
but
listen
not
that
i
want
to
cross
you
up
deliberately
but
i
tell
you
now
that
a
man
does
like
to
get
sliced
by
a
barber
even
such
a
little
nick
as
that
i
remember
that
address
and
the
cat
and
i
never
go
into
the
place
every
event
does
affect
the
succession
of
events
mentor
acknowledged
equably
enough
except
for
this
interview
you
would
have
been
in
new
orleans
at
that
time
instead
of
in
spokane
i
have
considered
every
pertinent
factor
you
will
be
a
busy
man
hence
while
you
will
think
of
this
matter
frequently
and
seriously
during
the
near
future
you
will
have
forgotten
it
in
less
than
five
years
you
will
remember
it
only
at
the
touch
of
the
astringent
whereupon
you
will
give
voice
to
certain
and
profane
remarks
i
ought
to
samms
grinned
a
grin
he
had
been
appalled
by
the
quality
of
mind
able
to
do
what
mentor
had
just
done
he
was
now
more
than
appalled
by
the
arisian
calm
certainty
that
what
he
had
foretold
in
such
detail
would
in
every
detail
come
to
pass
if
after
all
this
spokane
let
a
kitten
jump
into
my
lap
let
a
tony
carbonero
nick
me
mentor
i
do
i
deserve
to
be
called
everything
i
can
think
of
these
that
i
have
mentioned
the
gross
occurrences
are
problems
only
for
inexperienced
thinkers
mentor
paid
no
attention
to
determination
never
to
enter
that
shop
the
real
difficulties
lie
in
the
fine
detail
such
as
the
length
mass
and
exact
place
and
position
of
landing
upon
apron
or
floor
of
each
of
your
hairs
as
it
is
severed
many
factors
are
involved
other
clients
passing
by
opening
and
shutting
doors
air
currents
sunshine
wind
pressure
temperature
humidity
the
exact
fashion
in
which
the
barber
will
flick
his
shears
which
in
turn
depends
upon
many
other
factors
what
he
will
have
been
doing
previously
what
he
will
have
eaten
and
drunk
whether
or
not
his
home
life
will
have
been
happy
you
little
realize
youth
what
a
priceless
opportunity
this
will
be
for
me
to
check
the
accuracy
of
my
visualization
i
shall
spend
many
periods
upon
the
problem
i
can
not
attain
perfect
accuracy
of
course
ninety
nine
point
nine
nines
percent
let
us
say
or
perhaps
ten
nines
is
all
that
i
can
reasonably
expect
but
mentor
samms
protested
i
ca
help
you
on
a
thing
like
that
how
can
i
know
or
report
the
exact
mass
length
and
orientation
of
single
hairs
you
can
not
but
since
you
will
be
wearing
your
lens
i
myself
can
and
will
compare
minutely
my
visualization
with
the
actuality
for
know
youth
that
wherever
any
lens
is
there
can
any
arisian
be
if
he
so
desires
and
now
knowing
that
fact
and
from
your
own
knowledge
of
the
satisfactions
to
be
obtained
from
chess
and
other
such
mental
activities
and
from
the
glimpses
you
have
had
into
my
own
mind
do
you
retain
any
doubts
that
we
arisians
will
be
fully
compensated
for
the
trifling
effort
involved
in
furnishing
whatever
number
of
lenses
may
be
required
i
have
no
more
doubts
but
this
lens
i
getting
more
afraid
of
it
every
minute
i
see
that
it
is
a
perfect
identification
i
can
understand
that
it
can
be
a
perfect
telepath
but
is
it
something
else
as
well
if
it
has
other
powers
what
are
they
i
can
not
tell
you
or
rather
i
will
not
it
is
best
for
your
own
development
that
i
do
not
except
in
the
most
general
terms
it
has
additional
qualities
it
is
true
but
since
no
two
entities
ever
have
the
same
abilities
no
two
lenses
will
ever
be
of
identical
qualities
strictly
speaking
a
lens
has
no
real
power
of
its
own
it
merely
concentrates
intensifies
and
renders
available
whatever
powers
are
already
possessed
by
its
wearer
you
must
develop
your
own
powers
and
your
own
abilities
we
of
arisia
in
furnishing
the
lens
will
have
done
everything
that
we
should
do
of
course
sir
and
much
more
than
we
have
any
right
to
expect
you
have
given
me
a
lens
for
roderick
kinnison
how
about
the
others
who
is
to
select
them
you
are
for
a
time
silencing
the
man
protests
mentor
went
on
you
will
find
that
your
judgment
will
be
good
you
will
send
to
us
only
one
entity
who
will
not
be
given
a
lens
and
it
is
necessary
that
that
one
entity
should
be
sent
here
you
will
begin
a
system
of
selection
and
training
which
will
become
more
and
more
rigorous
as
time
goes
on
this
will
be
necessary
not
for
the
selection
itself
which
the
lensmen
themselves
could
do
among
babies
in
their
cradles
but
because
of
the
benefits
thus
conferred
upon
the
many
who
will
not
graduate
as
well
as
upon
the
few
who
will
in
the
meantime
you
will
select
the
candidates
and
you
will
be
shocked
and
dismayed
when
you
discover
how
few
you
will
be
able
to
send
you
will
go
down
in
history
as
first
lensman
samms
the
crusader
the
man
whose
wide
vision
and
tremendous
grasp
made
it
possible
for
the
galactic
patrol
to
become
what
it
is
to
be
you
will
have
highly
capable
help
of
course
the
kinnisons
with
their
irresistible
driving
force
their
indomitable
will
to
do
their
transcendent
urge
costigan
back
of
whose
stout
irish
heart
lie
erin
best
of
brains
and
brawn
your
cousins
george
and
ray
olmstead
your
daughter
virgilia
virgilia
where
does
fit
into
this
picture
what
do
you
know
about
her
and
how
a
mind
would
be
incompetent
indeed
who
could
not
visualize
from
even
the
most
fleeting
contact
with
you
a
fact
which
has
been
in
existence
for
some
twenty
three
of
your
years
her
doctorate
in
psychology
her
intensive
studies
under
martian
and
venerian
masters
even
under
one
reformed
adept
of
north
polar
jupiter
of
the
involuntary
uncontrollable
almost
unknown
and
hence
highly
revealing
muscles
of
the
face
the
hands
and
other
parts
of
the
human
body
you
will
remember
that
poker
game
for
a
long
time
i
certainly
will
samms
grinned
a
bit
shamefacedly
she
gave
us
clear
warning
of
what
she
was
going
to
do
and
then
cleaned
us
out
to
the
last
millo
naturally
she
has
all
unconsciously
been
training
herself
for
the
work
she
is
destined
to
do
but
to
resume
you
will
feel
yourself
incompetent
unworthy
that
too
is
a
part
of
a
lensman
load
when
you
first
scan
the
mind
of
roderick
kinnison
you
will
feel
that
he
not
you
should
be
the
prime
mover
in
the
galactic
patrol
but
know
now
that
no
mind
not
even
the
most
capable
in
the
universe
can
either
visualize
truly
or
truly
evaluate
itself
commissioner
kinnison
upon
scanning
your
mind
as
he
will
scan
it
will
know
the
truth
and
will
be
well
content
but
time
presses
in
one
minute
you
leave
thanks
a
lot
thanks
samms
got
to
his
feet
and
paused
hesitantly
i
suppose
that
it
will
be
all
right
that
is
i
can
call
on
you
again
if
no
the
arisian
declared
coldly
my
visualization
does
not
indicate
that
it
will
ever
again
be
either
necessary
or
desirable
for
you
to
visit
or
to
communicate
with
me
or
with
any
other
arisian
communication
ceased
as
though
a
solid
curtain
had
been
drawn
between
the
two
samms
strode
out
and
stepped
into
the
waiting
vehicle
which
whisked
him
back
to
his
lifeboat
he
blasted
off
arriving
in
the
control
room
of
the
precisely
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
hour
after
leaving
it
well
rod
i
back
he
began
and
stopped
utterly
unable
to
speak
for
at
the
mention
of
the
name
samms
lens
had
put
him
fully
en
rapport
with
his
friend
whole
mind
and
what
he
perceived
struck
him
literally
and
precisely
dumb
he
had
always
liked
and
admired
rod
kinnison
he
had
always
known
that
he
was
tremendously
able
and
capable
he
had
known
that
he
was
big
clean
a
square
shooter
the
world
best
hard
a
driver
who
had
little
more
mercy
on
his
underlings
in
selected
undertakings
than
he
had
on
himself
but
now
as
he
saw
spread
out
for
his
inspection
kinnison
ego
in
its
entirety
as
he
compared
in
fleeting
glances
that
terrific
mind
with
those
of
the
other
officers
good
men
too
all
of
them
assembled
in
the
room
he
knew
that
he
had
never
even
begun
to
realize
what
a
giant
roderick
kinnison
really
was
what
the
matter
virge
kinnison
exclaimed
and
hurried
up
both
hands
outstretched
you
look
like
you
seeing
ghosts
what
did
they
do
to
you
nothing
much
but
does
half
describe
what
i
seeing
right
now
come
into
my
office
will
you
rod
ignoring
the
curious
stares
of
the
junior
officers
the
commissioner
and
the
councillor
went
into
the
latter
quarters
and
in
those
quarters
the
two
lensmen
remained
in
close
consultation
during
practically
all
of
the
return
trip
to
earth
in
fact
they
were
still
conferring
deeply
via
lens
when
the
landed
and
they
took
a
into
the
hill
but
who
are
you
going
to
send
first
virge
kinnison
demanded
you
must
have
decided
on
at
least
some
of
them
by
this
time
i
know
of
only
five
or
possibly
six
who
are
ready
samms
replied
glumly
i
would
have
sworn
that
i
knew
of
a
hundred
but
they
measure
up
jack
mason
northrop
and
conway
costigan
for
the
first
load
lyman
cleveland
fred
rodebush
and
perhaps
bergenholm
i
been
able
to
figure
him
out
but
i
know
when
i
get
him
under
my
lens
next
that
all
not
quite
how
about
your
cousins
ray
and
george
olmstead
who
have
been
doing
such
a
terrific
job
of
perhaps
quite
possibly
and
if
i
good
enough
clayton
and
schweikert
certainly
are
to
name
only
two
of
the
commodores
and
knobos
and
dalnalten
and
above
all
how
about
jill
jill
why
i
do
she
measures
up
of
course
but
but
at
that
there
was
nothing
said
against
it
either
i
wonder
why
not
have
the
boys
in
jill
too
and
thrash
it
out
the
young
people
were
called
in
the
story
was
told
the
problem
stated
the
boys
reaction
was
instantaneous
and
unanimous
jack
kinnison
took
the
lead
of
course
jill
going
if
anybody
does
he
burst
out
vehemently
count
out
with
all
the
stuff
she
got
why
jack
this
from
jill
seemed
highly
surprised
i
have
it
on
excellent
authority
that
i
a
stinker
a
one
at
that
a
with
eyes
you
are
and
a
lot
of
other
things
besides
jack
kinnison
did
not
back
up
a
millimeter
even
before
their
fathers
but
even
at
your
sapadilliest
your
half
wits
are
better
than
most
other
people
whole
ones
and
i
never
said
or
thought
that
your
brain
could
function
whenever
it
wanted
to
back
of
those
sad
eyes
whatever
it
takes
to
be
a
lensman
sir
he
turned
to
samms
she
got
just
as
much
of
as
the
rest
of
us
maybe
more
i
take
it
then
that
there
is
no
objection
to
her
going
samms
asked
there
was
no
objection
what
ship
shall
we
take
and
when
the
now
kinnison
directed
she
hot
and
ready
we
did
strike
any
trouble
going
or
coming
so
she
did
need
much
servicing
flit
they
flitted
and
the
great
battleship
made
the
second
cruise
as
uneventfully
as
she
had
made
the
first
the
officers
and
crew
knew
that
the
young
people
left
the
vessel
separately
that
they
returned
separately
each
in
his
or
her
lifeboat
they
met
however
not
in
the
control
room
but
in
jack
kinnison
private
quarters
the
three
young
lensmen
and
the
girl
the
three
were
embarrassed
ill
at
ease
the
lenses
were
definitely
not
working
no
one
of
them
would
put
his
lens
on
jill
since
she
did
not
have
one
the
girl
broke
the
short
silence
was
she
the
most
perfectly
thing
you
ever
saw
she
breathed
in
spite
of
being
over
seven
feet
tall
she
looked
to
be
about
twenty
except
her
eyes
but
she
must
have
been
a
hundred
to
know
so
much
but
what
are
you
boys
staring
so
about
three
voices
blurted
as
one
yes
she
why
i
know
we
were
together
but
i
got
the
impression
some
way
or
other
that
there
was
only
the
one
what
did
see
all
three
men
started
to
talk
at
once
a
clamor
of
noise
then
all
stopped
at
once
you
first
spud
whom
did
you
talk
to
and
what
did
he
she
or
it
say
although
conway
costigan
was
a
few
years
older
than
the
other
three
they
all
called
him
by
nickname
as
a
matter
of
course
national
police
headquarters
chief
of
the
detective
bureau
costigan
reported
crisply
between
forty
three
and
forty
five
six
feet
and
half
an
inch
one
seventy
five
hard
fine
keen
a
big
time
operator
if
there
ever
was
one
looked
a
lot
like
your
father
jill
the
same
dark
auburn
hair
just
beginning
to
gray
and
the
same
deep
markings
in
his
eyes
he
gave
me
the
works
then
took
this
lens
out
of
his
safe
snapped
it
onto
my
wrist
and
gave
me
two
orders
get
out
and
stay
out
jack
and
mase
stared
at
costigan
at
jill
and
at
each
other
then
they
whistled
in
unison
i
see
this
is
not
going
to
be
a
unanimous
report
except
possibly
in
one
minor
detail
jill
remarked
mase
you
next
i
landed
on
the
campus
of
the
university
of
arisia
northrop
stated
flatly
immense
place
hundreds
of
thousands
of
students
they
look
me
to
the
physics
department
to
the
private
laboratory
of
the
department
head
himself
he
had
a
panel
with
about
a
million
meters
and
gauges
on
it
he
scanned
and
measured
every
individual
component
element
of
my
brain
then
he
made
a
pattern
on
a
milling
router
just
about
as
complicated
as
his
panel
from
there
on
of
course
it
was
simple
just
like
a
dentist
making
a
set
of
china
choppers
or
a
metallurgist
embedding
a
he
snapped
a
couple
of
sentences
of
directions
at
me
and
then
said
that
all
sure
that
was
all
costigan
asked
did
he
add
scrammed
he
did
it
exactly
but
the
implication
was
clear
enough
the
one
point
of
similarity
jill
commented
now
you
jack
you
have
been
looking
as
though
we
were
all
candidates
for
canvas
jackets
that
lace
tightly
up
the
back
as
though
maybe
am
i
did
see
anything
at
all
even
land
on
the
planet
just
floated
around
in
an
orbit
inside
that
screen
the
thing
i
talked
with
was
a
pattern
of
pure
force
this
lens
simply
appeared
on
my
wrist
bracelet
and
all
out
of
thin
air
he
told
me
plenty
though
in
a
very
short
time
his
last
word
being
for
me
not
to
come
back
or
call
back
hm
m
this
of
jack
was
a
particularly
indigestible
bit
even
for
jill
samms
in
plain
words
costigan
volunteered
we
all
saw
exactly
what
we
expected
to
see
jill
denied
i
certainly
did
not
expect
to
see
a
woman
no
what
each
of
us
saw
i
think
was
what
would
do
us
the
most
good
give
each
of
us
the
highest
possible
lift
i
am
wondering
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
at
all
really
there
that
might
be
it
at
that
jack
scowled
in
concentration
but
there
must
have
been
there
these
lenses
are
real
but
what
makes
me
mad
is
that
they
would
give
you
a
lens
you
just
as
good
a
man
as
any
one
of
us
if
i
did
know
it
would
do
a
damn
bit
of
good
i
go
back
there
right
now
and
do
pop
off
so
jack
jill
eyes
however
were
starry
i
know
you
mean
it
and
i
could
almost
love
you
at
times
but
i
do
need
a
lens
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
be
much
better
off
without
one
jet
back
jill
jack
kinnison
stared
deeply
into
the
girl
eyes
but
still
did
not
use
his
lens
somebody
must
have
done
a
terrific
job
of
selling
to
make
you
believe
that
or
you
sold
actually
actually
honestly
that
arisian
was
a
thousand
times
more
of
a
woman
than
i
ever
will
be
and
she
did
wear
a
lens
never
had
worn
one
women
minds
and
lenses
do
fit
there
a
incompatibility
lenses
are
as
masculine
as
whiskers
and
at
that
only
a
very
few
men
can
ever
wear
them
either
very
special
men
like
you
three
and
dad
and
pops
kinnison
men
with
tremendous
force
drive
and
scope
pure
killers
all
of
you
each
in
his
own
way
of
course
no
more
to
be
stopped
than
a
glacier
and
twice
as
hard
and
ten
times
as
cold
a
woman
simply
have
that
kind
of
a
mind
there
is
going
to
be
a
woman
lensman
some
day
just
one
but
not
for
years
and
years
and
i
would
be
in
her
shoes
for
anything
in
this
job
of
mine
of
well
go
on
what
is
this
job
you
so
sure
you
are
going
to
do
why
i
do
know
jill
exclaimed
startled
eyes
wide
i
thought
i
knew
all
about
it
but
i
do
do
you
about
yours
they
did
not
not
one
of
them
and
they
were
all
as
surprised
at
that
fact
as
the
girl
had
been
well
to
get
back
to
this
lady
lensman
who
is
going
to
appear
some
day
i
gather
that
she
is
going
to
be
some
kind
of
a
freak
she
have
to
be
practically
because
of
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
lens
mentor
did
say
so
in
so
many
words
but
she
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
mentor
the
three
men
exclaimed
each
of
them
had
dealt
with
mentor
i
am
beginning
to
see
jill
said
thoughtfully
mentor
not
a
real
name
at
all
to
quote
the
unabridged
verbatim
i
had
occasion
to
look
the
word
up
the
other
day
and
i
am
appalled
now
at
the
certainty
that
there
was
a
connection
quote
mentor
a
wise
and
faithful
counselor
unquote
have
any
of
you
boys
anything
to
say
i
have
and
i
am
beginning
to
be
scared
blue
silence
fell
and
the
more
they
thought
those
three
young
lensmen
and
the
girl
who
was
one
of
the
two
human
women
ever
to
encounter
knowingly
an
arisian
mind
the
deeper
that
silence
became
chapter
so
you
did
find
anything
on
nevia
roderick
kinnison
got
up
deposited
the
butt
of
his
cigar
in
an
ashtray
lit
another
and
prowled
about
the
room
hands
jammed
deep
into
breeches
pockets
i
surprised
nerado
struck
me
as
being
a
i
thought
sure
he
qualify
so
did
i
samms
tone
was
glum
he
big
time
and
an
operator
but
not
big
enough
by
far
i
we
both
finding
out
that
lensman
material
is
scarce
stuff
there
none
on
nevia
and
no
indication
whatever
that
there
ever
will
be
any
tough
and
you
right
of
course
in
your
stand
that
we
have
to
have
lensmen
from
as
many
different
solar
systems
as
possible
on
the
galactic
council
or
the
thing
wo
work
at
all
so
damned
much
jealousy
which
is
one
reason
why
we
here
in
new
york
instead
of
out
at
the
hill
where
we
belong
we
found
that
out
already
even
in
such
a
small
and
comparatively
homogeneous
group
as
our
own
system
the
solarian
council
will
not
only
have
to
be
made
up
mostly
of
lensmen
but
each
and
every
inhabited
planet
of
sol
will
have
to
be
represented
even
pluto
i
suppose
in
time
and
by
the
way
your
saunders
was
any
too
pleased
when
you
took
knobos
of
mars
and
dalnalten
of
venus
away
from
him
and
made
lensmen
out
of
them
and
put
them
miles
over
his
head
oh
i
would
say
that
exactly
i
convinced
him
but
at
that
since
saunders
is
not
lensman
grade
himself
it
was
a
trifle
difficult
for
him
to
understand
the
situation
completely
you
say
it
easy
is
not
the
word
i
would
use
but
back
to
the
lensman
hunt
kinnison
scowled
blackly
i
agree
as
i
said
before
that
we
need
lensmen
the
more
the
better
but
i
do
think
much
of
your
chance
of
finding
any
what
makes
you
think
oh
i
see
but
i
do
know
whether
you
justified
or
not
in
assuming
a
high
positive
correlation
between
a
certain
kind
of
mental
ability
and
technological
advancement
no
such
assumption
is
necessary
start
anywhere
you
please
rod
and
take
it
from
there
including
nevia
i
start
with
known
facts
then
interstellar
flight
is
new
to
us
we
have
spread
far
or
surveyed
much
territory
but
in
the
eight
solar
systems
with
which
we
are
most
familiar
there
are
seven
planets
i
not
counting
valeria
which
are
very
much
like
earth
in
point
of
mass
size
climate
atmosphere
and
gravity
five
of
the
seven
did
not
have
any
intelligent
life
and
were
colonized
easily
and
quickly
the
tellurian
worlds
of
procyon
and
vega
became
friendly
neighbors
thank
god
we
learned
something
on
nevia
because
they
were
already
inhabited
by
highly
advanced
races
procia
by
people
as
human
as
we
are
vegia
by
people
who
would
be
so
if
it
were
for
their
tails
many
other
worlds
of
these
systems
are
inhabited
by
more
or
less
intelligent
races
just
how
intelligent
they
are
we
know
but
the
lensmen
will
soon
find
out
my
point
is
that
no
race
we
have
found
so
far
has
had
either
atomic
energy
or
any
form
of
in
any
contact
with
races
having
we
have
not
been
the
discoverers
but
the
discovered
colonies
are
all
within
twenty
six
of
earth
except
aldebaran
ii
which
is
fifty
seven
but
which
drew
a
lot
of
people
in
spite
of
the
distance
because
it
was
so
nearly
identical
with
earth
on
the
other
hand
the
nevians
from
a
distance
of
over
a
hundred
found
implying
an
older
race
and
a
higher
development
but
you
just
told
me
that
they
would
produce
a
lensman
that
point
stopped
me
too
at
first
follow
through
i
want
to
see
if
you
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
i
did
well
i
i
kinnison
thought
intensely
then
went
on
of
course
the
nevians
were
not
colonizing
nor
strictly
speaking
exploring
they
were
merely
hunting
for
iron
a
highly
organized
intensively
specialized
operation
to
find
a
raw
material
they
needed
desperately
precisely
samms
agreed
the
rigellians
however
were
and
rigel
is
about
four
hundred
and
forty
from
here
we
did
have
a
thing
they
needed
or
wanted
they
nodded
at
us
in
passing
and
kept
on
going
still
on
your
track
dead
center
and
just
where
does
that
put
the
palainians
i
see
you
may
have
something
there
at
that
palain
is
so
far
away
that
nobody
knows
even
where
it
is
probably
thousands
of
yet
they
have
not
only
explored
this
system
they
colonized
pluto
long
before
our
white
race
colonized
america
but
damn
it
virge
i
do
like
it
any
part
of
it
rigel
four
you
may
be
able
to
take
with
your
lens
even
one
of
their
damned
automobiles
if
you
stay
solidly
en
rapport
with
the
driver
but
virge
pluto
is
bad
enough
but
the
home
planet
you
ca
nobody
can
it
simply
ca
be
done
i
know
it
wo
be
easy
samms
admitted
bleakly
but
if
it
got
to
be
done
i
do
it
and
i
have
a
little
information
that
i
had
time
to
tell
you
yet
we
discussed
once
before
you
remember
what
a
job
it
was
to
get
into
any
kind
of
communication
with
the
palainians
on
pluto
you
said
then
that
nobody
could
understand
them
and
you
were
right
then
however
i
those
tapes
wearing
my
lens
and
could
understand
them
the
thoughts
that
is
as
well
as
though
they
had
been
recorded
in
english
kinnison
exclaimed
then
fell
silent
samms
remained
silent
what
they
were
thinking
of
arisia
lens
can
not
be
expressed
in
words
well
go
on
kinnison
finally
said
give
me
the
rest
of
it
the
stinger
that
you
been
holding
back
the
messages
were
clear
and
plain
the
backgrounds
however
the
connotations
and
implications
were
not
some
of
their
codes
and
standards
seem
to
be
radically
different
from
ours
so
utterly
and
fantastically
different
that
i
simply
can
not
reconcile
either
their
conduct
or
their
ethics
with
their
obviously
high
intelligence
and
their
advanced
state
of
development
however
they
have
at
least
some
minds
of
tremendous
power
and
none
of
the
peculiarities
i
deduced
were
of
such
a
nature
as
to
preclude
lensmanship
therefore
i
am
going
to
pluto
and
from
there
i
hope
to
palain
seven
if
there
a
lensman
there
i
get
him
you
will
at
that
kinnison
paid
quiet
tribute
to
what
he
better
than
anyone
else
knew
that
his
friend
had
but
enough
of
me
how
are
you
doing
as
well
as
can
be
expected
at
this
stage
of
the
game
the
thing
is
developing
along
three
main
lines
first
the
pirates
since
that
kind
of
thing
is
more
or
less
my
own
line
i
handling
it
myself
unless
and
until
you
find
someone
better
qualified
i
got
jack
and
costigan
working
on
it
now
second
drugs
vice
and
so
on
i
hope
you
find
somebody
to
take
this
line
over
because
frankly
i
in
over
my
depth
and
want
to
get
out
knobos
and
dalnalten
are
trying
to
find
out
if
there
anything
to
the
idea
that
there
may
be
a
planetary
or
even
ring
involved
since
sid
fletcher
is
a
lensman
i
could
disconnect
him
openly
from
his
job
but
he
knows
a
lot
about
the
situation
and
is
working
practically
full
time
with
the
other
two
third
pure
or
rather
decidedly
impure
politics
the
more
i
studied
subject
the
clearer
it
became
that
politics
would
be
the
worst
and
biggest
battle
of
the
three
there
are
too
many
angles
i
know
a
damned
thing
about
such
as
what
to
do
about
the
succession
of
foaming
screaming
fits
your
friend
senator
morgan
will
be
throwing
the
minute
he
finds
out
what
our
galactic
patrol
is
going
to
do
so
i
ducked
the
whole
political
line
now
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
better
probably
that
morgan
is
only
the
pernicious
activities
committee
of
the
north
american
senate
multiply
him
by
the
thousands
of
others
all
over
space
who
will
be
on
our
necks
before
the
patrol
can
get
its
and
you
will
see
that
all
that
stuff
will
have
to
be
handled
by
a
lensman
who
as
well
as
being
a
mighty
smooth
operator
will
have
to
know
the
answers
and
will
have
to
have
plenty
of
guts
i
got
the
guts
but
none
of
the
other
prime
requisites
jill
has
although
she
got
everything
else
fairchild
your
relations
ace
is
a
lensman
and
can
never
become
one
so
you
can
see
quite
plainly
who
has
got
to
handle
politics
himself
you
may
be
right
but
this
lensman
business
comes
first
samms
pondered
then
brightened
perhaps
probably
i
can
find
somebody
on
this
trip
a
palainian
say
who
is
better
qualified
than
any
of
us
kinnison
snorted
if
you
can
i
buy
you
a
week
in
any
venerian
relaxerie
you
want
to
name
better
start
saving
up
your
credits
then
because
from
what
i
already
know
of
the
palainian
mentality
such
a
development
is
distinctly
more
than
a
possibility
samms
paused
his
eyes
narrowing
i
do
know
whether
it
would
make
morgan
and
his
kind
more
rabid
or
less
so
to
have
a
entity
possess
authority
in
our
affairs
political
but
at
least
it
would
be
something
new
and
different
but
in
spite
of
what
you
said
about
politics
what
have
you
got
northrop
jill
and
fairchild
doing
well
we
had
a
couple
of
discussions
i
could
give
either
jill
or
dick
orders
of
course
would
you
mean
samms
corrected
could
kinnison
insisted
jill
besides
being
your
daughter
and
lensman
grade
had
no
official
connection
with
either
the
triplanetary
service
or
the
solarian
patrol
and
the
service
including
fairchild
is
still
triplanetary
and
it
will
have
to
stay
triplanetary
until
you
have
found
enough
lensmen
so
that
you
can
spring
your
twin
surprises
galactic
council
and
galactic
patrol
however
northrop
and
fairchild
are
keeping
their
eyes
and
ears
open
and
their
mouths
shut
and
jill
is
finding
out
whatever
she
can
about
drugs
and
so
on
as
well
as
the
various
political
angles
they
report
to
you
facts
deductions
guesses
and
recommendations
whenever
you
say
the
word
nice
work
rod
thanks
i
think
i
call
jill
now
before
i
go
wonder
where
she
is
but
i
wonder
with
the
lens
perhaps
telephones
are
superfluous
i
try
it
jill
he
thought
intensely
into
his
lens
forming
as
he
did
so
a
mental
image
of
his
gorgeous
daughter
as
he
knew
her
but
he
found
greatly
to
his
surprise
that
neither
elaboration
nor
emphasis
was
necessary
ouch
came
the
almost
instantaneous
answer
long
before
his
thought
was
complete
do
think
so
hard
dad
it
hurts
i
almost
missed
a
step
virgilia
was
actually
there
with
him
inside
his
own
mind
in
closer
touch
with
him
than
she
had
ever
before
been
back
so
soon
shall
we
report
now
or
are
you
ready
to
go
to
work
yet
skipping
for
the
moment
your
aspersions
on
my
present
activities
not
quite
samms
moderated
the
intensity
of
his
thought
to
a
conversational
level
just
wanted
to
check
with
you
come
in
rod
in
flashing
thoughts
he
brought
her
up
to
date
jill
do
you
agree
with
what
rod
here
has
just
told
me
yes
fully
so
do
the
boys
that
settles
it
then
unless
of
course
i
can
find
a
more
capable
substitute
of
course
but
we
will
believe
that
when
we
see
it
where
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
washington
european
embassy
dancing
with
herkimer
third
senator
morgan
number
one
secretary
i
was
going
to
make
passes
at
him
in
a
perfectly
way
of
course
but
it
was
necessary
he
thinks
he
can
break
down
my
resistance
careful
jill
that
kind
of
stuff
is
very
old
stuff
indeed
daddy
dear
simple
and
herkimer
third
really
a
menace
he
just
thinks
he
is
take
a
look
you
can
you
with
your
lens
perhaps
oh
yes
i
see
him
as
well
as
you
do
fully
en
rapport
with
the
girl
as
he
was
so
that
his
mind
received
simultaneously
with
hers
any
stimulus
which
she
was
willing
to
share
it
seemed
as
though
a
keen
handsome
deeply
tanned
face
bent
down
from
a
distance
of
inches
toward
his
own
but
i
do
like
it
a
bit
and
him
even
less
that
because
you
are
a
girl
jill
giggled
mentally
this
is
fun
and
it
wo
hurt
him
a
bit
except
maybe
for
a
slightly
bruised
vanity
when
i
do
fall
down
flat
at
his
feet
and
i
learning
a
lot
that
he
has
any
suspicion
he
giving
away
knowing
you
i
believe
that
but
do
that
is
well
be
careful
not
to
get
your
fingers
burned
the
job
is
worth
it
yet
do
worry
dad
she
laughed
unaffectedly
when
it
comes
to
playboys
like
this
one
i
got
millions
and
skillions
and
whillions
of
ohms
of
resistance
but
here
comes
senator
morgan
himself
with
a
fat
and
repulsive
venerian
he
calling
my
away
from
me
with
what
he
thinks
is
an
imperceptible
into
a
huddle
and
my
olfactory
nerves
perceive
a
rich
and
fruity
aroma
as
of
skunk
so
i
hate
to
seem
to
be
giving
a
solarian
councillor
the
but
if
i
want
to
read
what
goes
on
and
i
certainly
do
have
to
concentrate
as
soon
as
you
get
back
give
us
a
call
and
report
take
it
easy
dad
you
the
one
to
be
told
that
not
me
good
hunting
jill
samms
still
seated
calmly
at
his
desk
reached
out
and
pressed
a
button
marked
garage
his
office
was
on
the
seventieth
floor
the
garage
occupied
level
after
level
of
the
screen
brightened
a
keen
young
face
appeared
good
evening
jim
will
you
please
send
my
car
up
to
the
wright
skyway
feeder
at
once
sir
it
will
be
there
in
seventy
five
seconds
samms
cut
off
and
after
a
brief
exchange
of
thought
with
kinnison
went
out
into
the
hall
and
along
it
to
the
down
shaft
there
going
free
he
stepped
through
a
doorless
unguarded
archway
into
over
a
thousand
feet
of
air
although
it
was
long
after
conventional
office
hours
the
shaft
was
still
fairly
busy
but
that
made
no
difference
inertialess
collisions
can
not
even
be
felt
he
bulleted
downward
to
the
sixth
floor
where
he
brought
himself
to
an
instantaneous
halt
leaving
the
shaft
he
joined
the
now
thinning
crowd
hurrying
toward
the
exit
a
girl
with
meticulously
plucked
eyebrows
and
an
astounding
catching
sight
of
his
lens
took
her
hands
out
of
her
breeches
pockets
skirts
went
out
as
office
dress
when
velocities
of
a
hundred
or
so
miles
per
hour
replaced
elevators
nudged
her
companion
and
whispered
excitedly
look
there
quick
i
never
saw
one
close
up
before
did
you
him
himself
first
lensman
samms
at
the
portal
the
lensman
as
a
matter
of
habit
held
out
his
but
such
formalities
were
no
longer
necessary
or
even
possible
everybody
knew
or
wanted
to
be
thought
of
as
knowing
virgil
samms
stall
four
sixty
five
first
lensman
sir
the
uniformed
gateman
told
him
without
even
glancing
at
the
extended
disk
thank
you
tom
this
way
please
sir
first
lensman
and
a
youth
teeth
gleaming
white
in
a
startlingly
black
face
strode
proudly
to
the
indicated
stall
and
opened
the
vehicle
door
thank
you
danny
samms
said
as
appreciatively
as
though
he
did
not
know
exactly
where
his
was
he
got
in
the
door
jammed
itself
gently
shut
the
runabout
a
dillingham
shot
smoothly
forward
upon
its
two
fat
soft
tires
to
the
exit
archway
he
was
doing
forty
he
hit
the
curve
leading
into
the
lofty
street
at
ninety
nor
was
there
shock
or
strain
but
automatically
the
dilly
leaned
against
its
gyroscopes
at
precisely
the
correct
angle
the
huge
tires
clung
to
the
resilient
synthetic
of
the
pavement
as
though
integral
with
it
nor
was
there
any
question
of
conflicting
traffic
for
this
thoroughfare
six
full
levels
above
varick
street
proper
was
not
strictly
speaking
a
street
at
all
it
had
only
one
point
of
access
the
one
which
samms
had
used
and
only
one
exit
it
was
simply
and
only
a
feeder
into
wright
skyway
a
superhighway
samms
saw
without
noting
particularly
the
maze
of
of
which
this
feeder
was
only
one
tiny
part
a
maze
which
extended
from
up
to
a
point
well
above
even
the
towering
buildings
of
new
york
metropolitan
district
the
way
rose
sharply
samms
right
foot
went
down
a
little
farther
the
dillingham
began
to
pick
up
speed
moving
sang
to
him
and
yelled
and
blared
at
him
but
he
did
not
hear
them
brilliant
signs
flashing
and
flaring
all
the
colors
of
the
spectrum
sheer
triumphs
of
the
electrician
art
blazed
in
or
flamed
into
arresting
words
and
pictures
but
he
did
not
see
them
advertising
designed
by
experts
to
sell
everything
from
aardvarks
to
martian
zyzmol
bottled
ecstacy
but
the
first
lensman
was
a
seasoned
dweller
his
mind
had
long
since
become
a
perfect
filter
admitting
to
his
consciousness
only
things
which
he
wanted
to
perceive
only
so
can
life
be
made
endurable
approaching
the
skyway
he
cut
in
his
touring
roadlights
slowed
down
a
trifle
and
insinuated
his
into
the
stream
of
traffic
those
lights
threw
fifteen
hundred
watts
apiece
but
there
was
no
glare
polarized
lenses
and
saw
to
that
he
wormed
his
way
over
to
the
lane
and
opened
up
at
the
edge
of
the
skyscraper
district
where
wright
skyway
angles
sharply
downward
to
ground
level
samms
attention
was
caught
and
held
by
something
off
to
his
right
a
whistling
something
that
hurtled
upward
into
the
air
as
it
ascended
it
slowed
down
its
monotone
shriek
became
lower
and
lower
in
pitch
its
light
went
down
through
the
spectrum
toward
the
red
finally
it
exploded
with
an
crash
but
the
flash
of
the
detonation
instead
of
vanishing
almost
instantaneously
settled
itself
upon
a
artificial
cloud
and
became
a
picture
and
four
words
two
bearded
faces
and
smith
bros
cough
drops
well
i
be
damned
samms
spoke
aloud
chagrined
at
having
been
compelled
to
listen
to
and
to
look
at
an
advertisement
i
thought
i
had
seen
everything
but
is
really
new
twenty
minutes
fifty
miles
later
samms
left
the
skyway
at
a
point
near
what
had
once
been
south
norwalk
connecticut
an
area
transformed
now
into
the
level
square
miles
of
new
york
spaceport
new
york
spaceport
then
and
until
the
establishment
of
prime
base
the
biggest
and
busiest
field
in
existence
upon
any
planet
of
civilization
for
new
york
city
long
the
financial
and
commercial
capital
of
the
earth
had
maintained
the
same
dominant
position
in
the
affairs
of
the
solar
system
and
was
holding
a
substantial
lead
over
her
rivals
chicago
london
and
stalingrad
in
the
race
for
supremacy
and
virgil
samms
himself
because
of
the
menace
of
piracy
had
been
largely
responsible
for
the
policy
of
basing
the
of
the
triplanetary
patrol
upon
each
in
direct
ratio
to
the
size
and
importance
of
that
field
hence
he
was
no
stranger
in
new
york
spaceport
in
fact
master
psychologist
that
he
was
he
had
made
it
a
point
to
know
by
first
name
practically
everyone
connected
with
it
no
sooner
had
he
turned
his
dillingham
over
to
a
smiling
attendant
however
than
he
was
accosted
by
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
mr
samms
the
stranger
asked
yes
samms
did
not
energize
his
lens
he
had
not
yet
developed
either
the
inclination
or
the
technique
to
probe
instantaneously
every
entity
who
approached
him
upon
any
pretext
whatever
in
order
to
find
out
what
that
entity
wanted
i
isaacson
the
man
paused
as
though
he
had
supplied
a
world
of
information
yes
samms
was
receptive
but
not
impressed
interstellar
spaceways
you
know
we
been
trying
to
see
you
for
two
weeks
but
we
could
get
past
your
secretaries
so
i
decided
to
buttonhole
you
here
myself
but
we
just
as
much
alone
here
as
we
would
be
in
either
one
of
our
offices
yes
more
so
what
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
is
having
our
exclusive
franchise
extended
to
cover
the
outer
planets
and
the
colonies
just
a
minute
isaacson
surely
you
know
that
i
no
longer
have
even
a
portfolio
in
the
council
that
practically
all
of
my
attention
is
and
for
some
time
to
come
will
be
directed
elsewhere
exactly
isaacson
tone
spoke
volumes
but
still
the
boss
they
do
anything
you
tell
them
to
we
could
try
to
do
business
with
you
before
of
course
but
in
your
present
position
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
prevent
you
from
getting
into
the
biggest
thing
that
will
ever
be
we
are
the
biggest
corporation
in
existence
now
as
you
know
and
we
are
still
growing
fast
we
do
do
business
in
a
small
way
or
with
small
men
so
here
a
check
for
a
million
credits
or
i
will
deposit
it
to
your
account
i
not
interested
as
a
binder
the
other
went
on
as
smoothly
as
though
his
sentence
had
not
been
interrupted
with
million
more
to
follow
on
the
day
that
our
franchise
goes
through
i
still
not
interested
no
o
o
isaacson
studied
the
lensman
narrowly
and
samms
lens
now
wide
awake
studied
the
entrepreneur
well
i
while
i
admit
that
we
want
you
pretty
badly
you
are
smart
enough
to
know
that
we
get
what
we
want
anyway
with
or
without
you
with
you
though
it
will
be
easier
and
quicker
so
i
am
authorized
to
offer
you
besides
the
twenty
six
million
credits
he
savored
the
words
as
he
uttered
them
twenty
two
and
percent
of
spaceways
on
market
that
is
worth
fifty
million
credits
ten
years
from
now
it
will
be
worth
fifty
that
my
high
bid
that
as
high
as
we
can
possibly
go
i
glad
to
hear
that
i
not
interested
and
samms
strode
away
calling
his
friend
kinnison
as
he
did
so
rod
virgil
he
told
the
story
whew
kinnison
whistled
expressively
they
not
pikers
anyway
are
they
what
a
and
you
could
wrap
it
up
and
hand
it
to
them
like
a
pound
of
coffee
or
you
could
rod
could
be
the
big
lensman
ruminated
but
a
hookup
perfectly
legitimate
and
with
plenty
of
precedents
and
arguments
of
a
sort
in
its
favor
the
outer
planets
then
alpha
centauri
and
sirius
and
procyon
and
so
on
monopoly
all
the
traffic
will
bear
slavery
you
mean
samms
stormed
it
would
hold
civilization
back
for
a
thousand
years
sure
but
what
do
care
that
it
and
he
said
and
actually
believed
that
they
would
get
it
without
my
help
i
ca
help
wondering
about
that
simple
enough
virge
when
you
think
about
it
he
does
know
yet
what
a
lensman
is
nobody
does
you
know
except
lensmen
it
will
take
some
time
for
that
knowledge
to
get
around
and
still
longer
for
it
to
be
right
but
as
to
the
chance
of
interstellar
spaceways
ever
getting
the
monopoly
they
working
for
i
did
think
i
would
have
to
remind
you
that
it
was
not
entirely
by
accident
that
over
half
of
the
members
of
the
solarian
council
are
lensmen
and
that
any
galactic
councillor
will
automatically
to
be
a
lensman
so
go
right
ahead
with
what
you
started
my
boy
and
do
give
isaacson
and
company
another
thought
we
bend
an
optic
or
two
in
that
direction
while
you
are
gone
i
was
overlooking
a
few
things
at
that
i
guess
samms
sighed
in
relief
as
he
entered
the
main
office
of
the
patrol
the
line
at
the
receptionist
desk
was
fairly
short
but
even
so
samms
was
not
allowed
to
wait
that
highly
decorative
but
blonde
breaking
off
in
her
business
of
the
moment
turned
on
her
charm
as
though
it
had
been
a
battery
of
floodlights
pressed
a
stud
on
her
desk
and
spoke
to
the
man
before
her
and
to
the
lensman
excuse
me
a
moment
please
first
lensman
samms
sir
yes
miss
regan
her
communicator
in
every
day
parlance
broke
in
first
lensman
samms
is
here
sir
the
girl
announced
and
broke
the
circuit
good
evening
sylvia
wagner
please
or
whoever
else
is
handling
clearances
samms
answered
what
he
thought
was
to
have
been
her
question
oh
no
sir
you
are
cleared
commodore
clayton
has
been
waiting
for
you
here
he
is
now
hi
virgil
commodore
clayton
a
big
solid
man
with
a
scarred
face
and
a
shock
of
hair
whose
collar
bore
the
two
silver
stars
which
proclaimed
him
to
be
the
of
a
continental
contingent
of
the
patrol
shook
hands
vigorously
i
zip
you
out
miss
regan
call
a
bug
please
oh
that
is
necessary
alex
samms
protested
i
pick
one
up
outside
not
in
any
patrol
base
in
north
america
my
friend
nor
unless
i
am
very
badly
mistaken
anywhere
else
from
now
on
lensmen
have
absolute
priority
and
the
quicker
everybody
realizes
exactly
what
that
means
the
better
the
bug
a
vehicle
something
like
a
jeep
except
more
so
was
waiting
at
the
door
the
two
men
jumped
aboard
the
and
blast
clayton
ordered
crisply
the
driver
obeyed
literally
gravel
flew
from
beneath
skidding
tires
as
the
highly
maneuverable
little
took
off
a
screaming
turn
into
the
deservedly
famous
avenue
of
oaks
along
the
avenue
through
the
gate
the
guards
saluting
smartly
as
the
bug
raced
past
them
past
the
barracks
past
the
airport
hangars
and
strips
out
into
the
the
scarred
and
blackened
area
devoted
solely
to
the
docks
of
the
tremendous
vessels
which
plied
the
vacuous
reaches
of
and
space
spacedocks
were
and
are
huge
and
sprawling
structures
built
of
concrete
and
steel
and
asbestos
and
refractory
and
insulation
and
fully
and
having
refrigeration
equipment
of
thousands
of
tons
per
hour
of
ice
designed
not
only
to
expedite
servicing
unloading
and
loading
but
also
to
protect
materials
and
personnel
from
the
raving
searing
blasts
of
and
of
landing
a
is
a
squat
and
monstrous
cylinder
into
whose
hollow
top
the
lowermost
of
a
bulk
fits
as
snugly
as
does
a
baseball
into
the
pocket
of
a
veteran
fielder
glove
and
the
tremendous
distances
between
those
docks
minimize
the
apparent
size
both
of
the
structures
themselves
and
of
the
vessels
surmounting
them
thus
from
a
distance
the
looked
little
enough
and
harmless
enough
but
as
the
bug
flashed
under
the
overhanging
bulk
and
the
driver
braked
savagely
to
a
stop
at
one
of
the
dock
entrances
samms
could
scarcely
keep
from
flinching
that
featureless
gray
smoothly
curving
wall
of
alloy
steel
loomed
so
incredibly
high
above
them
extended
so
terrifyingly
far
outward
beyond
its
visible
means
of
support
it
be
on
the
very
verge
of
crashing
samms
stared
deliberately
at
the
mass
of
metal
towering
above
him
then
smiled
not
without
effort
at
his
companion
you
think
alex
that
a
man
would
get
over
being
afraid
that
a
ship
was
going
to
fall
on
him
but
i
have
yet
no
and
you
probably
never
will
i
never
have
and
i
one
of
the
old
hands
some
claim
not
to
mind
it
but
not
in
front
of
a
lie
detector
that
why
they
had
to
make
the
passenger
docks
bigger
than
the
liners
too
many
passengers
fainted
and
had
to
be
carried
aboard
on
stretchers
or
cancelled
passage
entirely
however
scaring
hell
out
of
them
on
the
ground
had
one
big
advantage
they
felt
so
safe
inside
that
they
did
get
the
so
bad
when
they
went
free
well
i
got
over
anyway
alex
and
thanks
samms
entered
the
dock
shot
smoothly
upward
followed
an
escorting
officer
to
the
captain
own
cabin
and
settled
himself
into
a
cushioned
chair
facing
an
a
face
appeared
upon
his
communicator
screen
and
spoke
winfield
to
first
lensman
samms
you
will
be
ready
to
blast
off
at
twenty
one
hundred
samms
to
captain
winfield
the
lensman
replied
i
will
be
ready
sirens
yelled
briefly
a
noise
which
samms
knew
was
purely
a
formality
clearance
had
been
issued
station
pixny
was
filling
the
air
with
warnings
personnel
and
material
close
enough
to
the
dock
to
be
affected
by
the
blast
were
under
cover
and
safe
the
blast
went
on
the
plate
showed
instead
of
a

so
terrific
were
the
forces
released

incandescent

for
hours
virgil
samms
sat
motionless
staring
almost
unseeing
into
his
plate
it
was
not
that
the
view
was
not
worth
seeing
the
wonder
of
space
the
panorama
of
incredibly
brilliant
although
dimensionless
points
of
light
against
that
wondrous
background
of
black
velvet
is
a
thing
that
never
fails
to
awe
even
the
most
seasoned
observer
but
he
had
a
tremendous
load
on
his
mind
he
had
to
solve
an
apparently
insoluble
problem
how
how
could
he
do
what
he
had
to
do
finally
knowing
that
the
time
of
landing
was
approaching
he
got
up
unfolded
his
fans
and
swam
lightly
through
the
air
of
the
cabin
to
a
along
which
he
drew
himself
into
the
control
room
he
could
have
made
the
trip
in
that
room
of
course
if
he
had
so
chosen
but
knowing
that
officers
of
space
do
not
really
like
to
have
strangers
in
that
sanctum
he
did
not
intrude
until
it
was
necessary
captain
winfield
was
already
strapped
down
at
his
master
conning
plate
pilots
navigators
and
computers
worked
busily
at
their
respective
tasks
i
was
just
going
to
call
you
first
lensman
winfield
waved
a
hand
in
the
general
direction
of
a
chair
near
his
own
take
the
station

then
after
a
few
minutes
go
inert
mr
white

all

white
spoke
conversationally
into
a
microphone
prepare
for
inert
maneuvering
class
three
off
a
bank
of
tiny
red
lights
upon
a
panel
turned
green
practically
as
one
white
cut
the
bergenholm
whereupon
virgil
samms
mass
changed
instantly
from
a
weight
of
zero
to
one
of
five
hundred
and
twenty
five
pounds
ships
of
war
then
had
no
space
to
waste
upon
such
as
artificial
gravity
although
he
was
braced
for
the
change
and
cushioned
against
it
the
lensman
breath
out
sharply
but
being
intensely
interested
in
what
was
going
on
he
swallowed
convulsively
a
couple
of
times
gasped
a
few
deep
breaths
and
fought
his
way
back
up
to
normalcy
the
chief
pilot
was
now
at
work
with
all
the
virtuoso
skill
of
his
rank
and
grade
one
of
the
of
which
is
to
make
difficult
tasks
look
easy
he
played
trills
and
runs
and
arpeggios
at
times
veritable
glissades
upon
keyboards
and
pedals
directing
with
micrometric
precision
the
tremendous
forces
of
the
superdreadnaught
to
the
task
of
matching
the
intrinsic
velocity
of
new
york
spaceport
at
the
time
of
his
departure
to
the
of
the
surface
of
the
planet
so
far
below
samms
stared
into
his
plate
first
at
the
incredibly
tiny
apparent
size
of
that
incredibly
hot
sun
and
then
at
the
world
toward
which
they
were
dropping
at
such
terrific
speed
it
does
seem
possible
he
remarked
half
to
winfield
half
to
himself
that
a
sun
could
be
that
big
and
that
hot
rigel
four
is
almost
two
hundred
times
as
far
away
from
it
as
earth
is
from
sol
something
like
eighteen
billion
miles
it
does
look
much
if
any
bigger
than
venus
does
from
luna
yet
this
world
is
hotter
than
the
sahara
desert
well
blue
giants
are
both
big
and
hot
the
captain
replied
and
their
radiation
being
mostly
invisible
is
deadly
stuff
and
rigel
is
about
the
biggest
in
this
region
there
are
others
a
lot
worse
though
doradus
s
for
instance
would
make
rigel
here
look
like
a
tallow
candle
i
going
out
there
some
of
these
days
just
to
take
a
look
at
it
but
that
enough
of
astronomical
we
down
to
twenty
miles
of
altitude
and
we
got
your
city
just
about
stopped
the
slowed
gently
to
a
halt
perched
motionless
upon
softly
hissing
jets
samms
directed
his
visibeam
downward
and
sent
along
it
an
exploring
questing
thought
since
he
had
never
met
a
rigellian
in
person
he
could
not
form
the
mental
image
or
pattern
necessary
to
become
en
rapport
with
any
one
individual
of
the
race
he
did
know
however
the
type
of
mind
which
must
be
possessed
by
the
entity
with
whom
he
wished
to
talk
and
he
combed
the
rigellian
city
until
he
found
one
the
rapport
was
so
incomplete
and
imperfect
as
to
amount
almost
to
no
contact
at
all
but
he
could
perhaps
make
himself
understood
if
you
will
excuse
this
possibly
unpleasant
and
certainly
unwarranted
intrusion
he
thought
carefully
and
slowly
i
would
like
very
much
to
discuss
with
you
a
matter
which
should
become
of
paramount
importance
to
all
the
intelligent
peoples
of
all
the
planets
in
space
i
welcome
you
tellurian
mind
fused
with
mind
at
every
one
of
uncountable
millions
of
points
and
paths
this
rigellian
professor
of
sociology
standing
at
his
desk
was
physically
a
monster
the
of
a
body
the
four
blocky
legs
the
tentacular
arms
that
immobile
dome
of
a
head
the
complete
lack
of
eyes
and
of
ears
nevertheless
samms
mind
fused
with
the
monstrosity
as
smoothly
as
effortlessly
and
almost
as
completely
as
it
had
with
his
own
daughter
and
a
mind
the
transcendent
poise
the
staggeringly
tremendous
range
and
scope
the
untroubled
and
unshakeable
calm
the
sublime
quietude
the
vast
and
placid
certainty
the
ultimate
stability
unknown
and
forever
unknowable
to
any
human
or
race
dismiss
all
thought
of
intrusion
first
lensman
samms
i
have
heard
of
you
human
beings
of
course
but
have
never
considered
seriously
the
possibility
of
meeting
one
of
you
mind
to
mind
indeed
it
was
reported
that
none
of
our
minds
could
make
any
except
the
barest
and
most
unsatisfactory
contact
with
any
of
yours
they
chanced
to
encounter
it
is
i
now
perceive
the
lens
which
makes
this
full
accord
possible
and
it
is
basically
about
the
lens
that
you
are
here
it
is
and
samms
went
on
to
cover
in
flashing
thoughts
his
conception
of
what
the
galactic
patrol
should
be
and
should
become
that
was
easy
enough
but
when
he
tried
to
describe
in
detail
the
qualifications
necessary
for
lensmanship
he
began
to
bog
down
force
drive
scope
of
course
range
power
but
above
all
an
absolute
integrity
an
ultimate
incorruptibility
he
could
recognize
such
a
mind
after
meeting
it
and
studying
it
but
as
to
finding
it
it
might
not
be
in
any
place
of
power
or
authority
his
own
and
rod
kinnison
happened
to
be
but
costigan
was
not
and
both
knobos
and
dalnalten
had
made
inconspicuousness
a
fine
art
i
see
the
native
stated
when
it
became
clear
that
samms
could
say
no
more
it
is
evident
of
course
that
i
can
not
qualify
nor
do
i
know
anyone
personally
who
can
however
what
samms
demanded
i
was
sure
from
the
feel
of
your
mind
that
you
but
with
a
mind
of
such
depth
and
breadth
such
tremendous
scope
and
power
you
must
be
incorruptible
i
am
came
the
dry
rejoinder
we
all
are
no
rigellian
is
or
ever
will
be
or
can
be
what
you
think
of
as
or
indeed
it
is
only
by
the
narrowest
most
intense
concentration
upon
every
line
of
your
thought
that
i
can
translate
your
meaning
into
a
concept
possible
for
any
of
us
even
to
understand
then
what
oh
i
see
i
was
starting
at
the
wrong
end
naturally
enough
i
suppose
i
looked
first
for
the
qualities
rarest
in
my
own
race
of
course
our
minds
have
ample
scope
and
range
and
perhaps
sufficient
power
but
those
qualities
which
you
refer
to
as
and
are
fully
as
rare
among
us
as
absolute
mental
integrity
is
among
you
what
you
know
as
is
unknown
we
have
no
police
no
government
no
laws
no
organized
armed
forces
of
any
kind
we
take
practically
always
the
line
of
least
resistance
we
live
and
let
live
as
your
thought
runs
we
work
together
for
the
common
good
well
i
do
know
what
i
expected
to
find
here
but
certainly
not
this
if
samms
had
never
before
been
completely
thunderstruck
completely
at
a
loss
he
was
then
you
do
think
then
that
there
is
any
chance
i
have
been
thinking
and
there
may
be
a
chance
a
slight
one
but
still
a
chance
the
rigellian
said
slowly
for
instance
that
youth
so
full
of
curiosity
who
first
visited
your
planet
thousands
of
us
have
wondered
to
ourselves
and
to
each
other
about
the
peculiar
qualities
of
mind
which
compelled
him
and
others
to
waste
so
much
time
effort
and
wealth
upon
a
project
so
completely
useless
as
exploration
why
he
had
even
to
develop
energies
and
engines
theretofore
unknown
and
which
can
never
be
of
any
real
use
samms
was
shaken
by
the
calm
finality
with
which
the
rigellian
dismissed
all
possibility
of
the
usefulness
of
exploration
but
stuck
doggedly
to
his
purpose
however
slight
the
chance
i
must
find
and
talk
to
this
man
i
suppose
he
is
now
out
in
deep
space
somewhere
have
you
any
idea
where
he
is
now
in
his
home
city
accumulating
funds
and
manufacturing
fuel
with
which
to
continue
his
pointless
activities
that
city
is
named
that
is
in
your
english
you
might
call
it
suntown
sunberg
no
it
must
be
more
specific
rigelsville
rigel
city
rigelston
i
would
translate
it
samms
hazarded
exactly
rigelston
the
professor
marked
its
location
upon
a
globular
mental
map
far
more
accurate
and
far
more
detailed
than
the
globe
which
captain
winfield
and
his
lieutenant
were
then
studying
thanks
now
can
you
and
will
you
get
in
touch
with
this
explorer
and
ask
him
to
call
a
meeting
of
his
full
crew
and
any
others
who
might
be
interested
in
the
project
i
have
outlined
i
can
i
will
he
and
his
kind
are
not
quite
sane
of
course
as
you
know
but
i
do
not
believe
that
even
they
are
so
insane
as
to
be
willing
to
subject
themselves
to
the
environment
of
your
vessel
they
will
not
be
asked
to
come
here
the
meeting
will
be
held
in
rigelston
if
necessary
i
shall
insist
that
it
be
held
there
you
would
i
perceive
that
you
would
it
is
strange
yes
fantastic
you
are
quarrelsome
pugnacious
vicious
and
timid
nervous
and
highly
and
senselessly
excitable
unbalanced
and
unsane
as
sheerly
monstrous
mentally
as
you
are
physically
these
outrageous
thoughts
were
sent
as
casually
and
as
impersonally
as
though
the
sender
were
discussing
the
weather
he
paused
then
went
on
and
yet
to
further
such
a
completely
visionary
project
you
are
eager
to
subject
yourself
to
conditions
whose
counterparts
i
could
not
force
myself
under
any
circumstances
whatever
to
meet
it
may
be
it
must
be
true
that
there
is
an
extension
of
the
principle
of
working
together
for
the
common
good
which
my
mind
for
lack
of
pertinent
data
has
not
been
able
to
grasp
i
am
now
en
rapport
with
dronvire
the
explorer
ask
him
please
not
to
identify
himself
to
me
i
do
not
want
to
go
into
that
meeting
with
any
preconceived
ideas
a
balanced
thought
the
rigellian
approved
someone
will
be
at
the
airport
to
point
out
to
you
the
already
desolated
area
in
which
the
of
the
explorers
makes
its
landings
dronvire
will
ask
someone
to
meet
you
at
the
airport
and
bring
you
to
the
place
of
meeting
the
telepathic
line
snapped
and
samms
turned
a
white
and
sweating
face
to
the
captain
god
what
a
strain
do
ever
try
telepathy
unless
you
positively
have
to
especially
not
with
such
an
outlandishly
race
as
these
rigellians
are
do
worry
i
wo
winfield
words
were
not
at
all
sympathetic
but
his
tone
was
you
looked
as
though
somebody
was
beating
your
brains
out
with
a
spiked
club
where
next
first
lensman
samms
marked
the
location
of
rigelston
upon
the
vessel
chart
then
donned
and
a
special
suit
of
armor
equipped
with
refrigerators
and
with
blocks
of
lead
glass
to
protect
the
eyes
the
airport
an
extremely
busy
one
well
outside
the
city
proper
was
located
easily
enough
as
was
the
spot
upon
which
the
tellurian
ship
was
to
land
lightly
slowly
she
settled
downward
her
jets
raving
out
against
a
gravity
fully
twice
that
of
her
native
earth
those
blasts
however
added
little
or
nothing
to
the
destruction
already
accomplished
by
the
craft
then
lying
there
a
cruiser
having
perhaps
of
the
mass
and
bulk
the
superdreadnaught
landed
sinking
into
the
hard
dry
ground
to
a
depth
of
some
ten
or
fifteen
feet
before
she
stopped
samms
en
rapport
with
the
entity
who
was
to
be
his
escort
made
a
flashing
survey
of
the
mind
so
intimately
in
contact
with
his
own
no
use
this
one
was
not
and
never
could
become
lensman
material
he
climbed
heavily
down
the
ladder
this
gravity
made
the
going
a
bit
difficult
but
he
could
stand
that
a
lot
better
than
some
of
the
other
things
he
was
going
to
have
to
take
the
rigellian
equivalent
of
an
automobile
was
there
waiting
for
him
its
door
invitingly
open
samms
had
known
in
general
what
to
expect
the
chassis
was
more
or
less
similar
to
that
of
his
own
dillingham
the
body
was
a
narrow
torpedo
of
steel
bluntly
pointed
at
both
ends
and
without
windows
two
features
however
were
both
unexpected
and
unpleasant
the
hard
tough
steel
of
which
that
body
was
forged
was
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
instead
of
and
even
that
extraordinarily
armored
body
was
dented
and
scarred
and
marred
especially
about
the
fore
and
rear
quarters
as
deeply
and
as
badly
and
as
casually
as
are
the
fenders
of
an
earthly
jalopy
the
lensman
climbed
not
easily
or
joyously
into
that
grimly
forbidding
black
interior
black
it
was
so
black
that
the
doorway
seemed
to
admit
no
light
at
all
it
was
blacker
than
a
witch
cat
in
a
coal
cellar
at
midnight
samms
flinched
then
stiffening
thought
at
the
driver
my
contact
with
you
seems
to
have
slipped
i
afraid
that
i
will
have
to
cling
to
you
rather
more
tightly
than
may
be
either
polite
or
comfortable
deprived
of
sight
and
without
your
sense
of
perception
i
am
practically
helpless
come
in
lensman
by
all
means
i
offered
to
maintain
full
engagement
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
declined
it
quite
possibly
the
misunderstanding
was
due
to
our
unfamiliarity
with
each
customary
mode
of
thought
relax
please
and
come
in
there
better
infinitely
better
thanks
and
it
was
the
darkness
vanished
through
the
unexplainable
perceptive
sense
of
the
rigellian
he
could
see
everything
he
had
a
practically
perfect
view
of
the
entire
circumambient
sphere
he
could
see
both
the
inside
and
the
outside
of
the
ground
car
he
was
in
and
of
the
immense
in
which
he
had
come
to
rigel
iv
he
could
see
the
bearings
and
the
of
the
engine
of
the
car
the
interior
structure
of
the
welds
that
held
the
steel
plates
together
the
busy
airport
outside
and
even
deep
into
the
ground
he
could
see
and
study
in
detail
the
most
heavily
shielded
parts
of
the
atomic
engines
of
the
but
he
was
wasting
time
he
could
also
plainly
see
a
chair
designed
to
fit
a
human
body
welded
to
a
stanchion
and
equipped
with
half
a
dozen
padded
restraining
straps
he
sat
down
quickly
strapped
himself
in
ready
ready
the
door
banged
shut
with
a
clangor
which
burst
through
and
with
all
the
violence
of
a
nearby
thunderclap
and
that
was
merely
the
beginning
the
engine
started
an
engine
of
well
over
a
thousand
horsepower
designed
for
maximum
efficiency
by
engineers
in
whose
lexicon
there
were
no
counterparts
of
any
english
words
relating
to
noise
or
even
to
sound
the
car
took
off
with
an
acceleration
which
drove
the
tellurian
backward
deep
into
the
cushions
the
scream
of
tortured
tires
and
the
crescendo
bellowing
of
the
engine
combined
to
form
an
uproar
which
amplified
by
and
reverberating
within
the
resonant
shell
of
metal
threatened
to
addle
the
very
brain
inside
the
lensman
skull
you
suffer
the
driver
exclaimed
in
high
concern
they
cautioned
me
to
start
and
stop
gently
to
drive
slowly
and
carefully
to
bump
softly
they
told
me
you
are
frail
and
fragile
a
fact
which
i
perceived
for
myself
and
which
has
caused
me
to
drive
with
the
utmost
possible
care
and
restraint
is
the
fault
mine
have
i
been
too
rough
not
at
all
it
is
that
it
the
ungodly
noise
then
realizing
that
the
rigellian
could
have
no
conception
of
his
meaning
he
continued
quickly
the
vibrations
in
the
atmosphere
from
sixteen
cycles
per
second
up
to
about
nine
or
ten
thousand
he
explained
what
a
second
was
my
nervous
system
is
very
sensitive
to
those
vibrations
but
i
expected
them
and
shielded
myself
against
them
as
adequately
as
i
could
nothing
can
be
done
about
them
go
ahead
atmospheric
vibrations
vibrations
atmospheric
the
driver
marveled
and
concentrated
upon
this
entirely
new
concept
while
he
swung
around
a
concrete
pillar
at
a
speed
of
at
least
sixty
miles
per
hour
grazing
it
so
closely
that
he
removed
one
layer
of
protective
coating
from
the
metal
braked
so
savagely
to
miss
a
wildly
careening
truck
that
the
restraining
straps
almost
cut
samms
body
and
all
into
slices
darted
into
a
hole
in
the
traffic
so
narrow
that
only
tiny
fractions
of
inches
separated
his
hurtling
juggernaut
from
an
enormous
steel
column
on
one
side
and
another
speeding
vehicle
on
the
other
executed
a
reverse
curve
thus
missing
by
breadths
two
vehicles
traveling
in
the
opposite
direction
and
one
in
his
own
as
a
grand
climax
to
this
spectacular
exhibition
of
insane
driving
he
plunged
at
full
speed
into
a
traffic
artery
which
seemed
so
full
already
that
it
could
not
hold
even
one
more
car
but
it
could
just
barely
could
however
instead
of
near
misses
or
grazing
hits
this
time
there
were
bumps
dents
little
ones
nothing
at
all
really
only
an
inch
or
so
deep
and
an
utterly
hellish
concatenation
and
concentration
of
noise
i
fail
completely
to
understand
what
effect
such
vibrations
could
have
the
rigellian
announced
finally
sublimely
unconscious
that
anything
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary
had
occurred
for
him
nothing
had
but
surely
they
can
not
be
of
any
use
on
this
world
i
am
afraid
not
no
samms
admitted
wearily
here
too
apparently
as
everywhere
the
big
cities
are
choking
themselves
to
death
with
their
own
traffic
yes
we
build
and
build
but
never
have
roads
enough
what
are
those
mounds
along
the
streets
for
some
time
samms
had
been
conscious
of
those
long
low
apparently
opaque
structures
attracted
to
them
because
they
were
the
only
objects
within
range
of
the
rigellian
mind
or
is
it
something
i
should
not
mention
what
oh
those
by
no
means
one
of
the
nearby
mounds
lost
its
opacity
it
was
filled
with
swirling
gyrating
bands
and
streamers
of
energy
so
vivid
and
so
solid
as
to
resemble
fabric
with
wildly
hurtling
objects
of
indescribable
shapes
and
contours
with
brilliantly
flashing
symbols
which
samms
found
greatly
to
his
surprise
made
sense
not
through
the
rigellian
mind
but
through
his
own
lens
eat
teegmee
food
advertising
samms
thought
was
a
snort
advertising
you
do
not
perceive
yours
either
as
you
drive
this
was
the
first
bond
to
be
established
between
two
of
the
most
highly
advanced
races
of
the
first
galaxy
the
frightful
drive
continued
the
noise
grew
worse
and
worse
imagine
if
you
can
a
city
of
fifteen
millions
of
people
throughout
whose
entire
length
breadth
height
and
depth
no
attempt
whatever
had
ever
been
made
to
abate
any
noise
however
violent
or
piercing
if
your
imagination
has
been
sufficiently
vivid
and
if
you
have
worked
understandingly
enough
the
product
may
approximate
what
first
lensman
samms
was
forced
to
listen
to
that
day
through
traffic
climbing
to
higher
and
ever
higher
roadways
between
towering
windowless
walls
of
steel
the
massive
rigellian
automobile
barged
and
banged
its
way
finally
it
stopped
a
thousand
feet
or
so
above
the
ground
beside
a
building
which
was
still
under
construction
the
heavy
door
clanged
open
they
got
out
and
then
it
chanced
to
be
daylight
at
the
time
samms
saw
a
tangle
of
fighting
screaming
whose
like
no
entity
possessing
the
sense
of
sight
had
ever
before
imagined
reds
yellows
blues
greens
purples
and
every
variation
and
possible
laid
on
or
splashed
on
or
occurring
naturally
at
perfect
random
smote
his
eyes
as
violently
as
the
noise
had
been
assailing
his
ears
he
realized
then
that
through
his
guide
sense
of
perception
he
had
been
seeing
only
in
shades
of
gray
that
to
these
people
visible
light
differed
only
in
from
any
other
band
of
the
complete
electromagnetic
spectrum
of
vibration
strained
and
tense
the
lensman
followed
his
escort
along
a
narrow
catwalk
through
a
wall
upon
which
riveters
and
welders
were
busily
at
work
into
a
room
practically
without
walls
and
ceiled
only
by
story
after
story
of
huge
yet
was
the
almost
a
hundred
rigellians
were
assembled
there
and
as
samms
walked
toward
the
group
a
craneman
dropped
a
couple
of
tons
of
steel
plate
from
a
height
of
eight
or
ten
feet
upon
the
floor
directly
behind
him
i
just
about
jumped
right
out
of
my
armor
is
the
way
samms
himself
described
his
reactions
and
that
description
is
perhaps
as
good
as
any
at
any
rate
he
went
briefly
out
of
control
and
the
rigellian
sent
him
a
steadying
inquiring
wondering
thought
he
could
no
more
understand
the
tellurian
sensitivity
than
samms
could
understand
the
fact
that
to
these
people
even
the
concept
of
physical
intrusion
was
absolutely
incomprehensible
these
builders
were
not
workmen
in
the
tellurian
sense
they
were
rigellians
each
working
his
few
hours
per
week
for
the
common
good
they
would
be
no
more
in
contact
with
the
meeting
than
would
their
fellows
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
samms
closed
his
eyes
to
the
riot
of
clashing
colors
deafened
himself
by
main
strength
to
the
appalling
clangor
of
sound
forced
himself
to
concentrate
every
fiber
of
his
mind
upon
his
errand
please
synchronize
with
my
mind
as
many
of
you
as
possible
he
thought
at
the
group
as
a
whole
and
went
en
rapport
with
mind
after
mind
after
mind
and
mind
after
mind
after
mind
lacked
something
some
were
stronger
than
others
had
more
initiative
and
drive
and
urge
but
none
would
quite
do
until
thank
god
in
the
wave
of
exultant
relief
of
fulfillment
samms
no
longer
saw
the
colors
or
heard
the
din
you
sir
are
of
lensman
grade
i
perceive
that
you
are
dronvire
yes
virgil
samms
i
am
dronvire
and
at
long
last
i
know
what
it
is
that
i
have
been
seeking
all
my
life
but
how
of
these
my
other
friends
are
not
some
of
them
i
do
not
know
nor
is
it
necessary
that
i
find
out
you
will
select
samms
paused
amazed
the
other
rigellians
were
still
in
the
room
but
mentally
he
and
dronvire
were
completely
alone
they
anticipated
your
thought
and
knowing
that
it
was
to
be
more
or
less
personal
they
left
us
until
one
of
us
invites
them
to
return
i
like
that
and
appreciate
it
you
will
go
to
arisia
you
will
receive
your
lens
you
will
return
here
you
will
select
and
send
to
arisia
as
many
or
as
few
of
your
fellows
as
you
choose
these
things
i
require
you
by
the
lens
of
arisia
to
do
afterward
please
note
that
this
is
in
no
sense
obligatory
i
would
like
very
much
to
have
you
visit
earth
and
accept
appointment
to
the
galactic
council
will
you
i
will
dronvire
needed
no
time
to
consider
his
decision
the
meeting
was
dismissed
the
same
entity
who
had
been
chauffeur
on
the
trip
drove
him
back
to
the
driving
as
slowly
and
as
carefully
as
before
nor
this
time
did
the
punishment
take
such
toll
even
though
samms
knew
that
each
terrific
lunge
and
lurch
was
adding
one
more
bruise
to
the
already
collection
discoloring
almost
every
square
foot
of
his
tough
hide
he
had
succeeded
and
the
thrill
of
success
had
its
usual
analgesic
effect
the
captain
met
him
in
the
and
helped
him
remove
his
suit
are
you
you
all
right
samms
winfield
was
no
longer
the
formal
captain
but
a
friend
even
though
you
did
call
we
were
beginning
to
wonder
you
look
as
though
you
been
to
a
valerian
clambake
and
i
sure
as
hell
do
like
the
way
you
favoring
those
ribs
and
that
left
leg
i
tell
the
boys
you
got
back
in
shape
but
i
have
the
doctors
look
you
over
just
to
make
sure
winfield
made
the
announcement
and
through
his
lens
samms
could
plainly
feel
the
wave
of
relief
and
pleasure
that
spread
throughout
the
great
ship
with
the
news
it
surprised
him
immensely
who
was
that
all
these
boys
should
care
so
much
whether
he
lived
or
died
i
perfectly
all
right
samms
protested
there
nothing
at
all
the
matter
with
me
that
twenty
hours
of
sleep
wo
fix
as
good
as
new
maybe
but
you
go
to
the
first
just
the
same
winfield
insisted
and
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
blast
back
to
tellus
right
and
fast
the
ambassadors
ball
is
next
tuesday
evening
you
know
and
that
one
function
i
ca
stay
away
from
even
with
a
class
a
double
prime
excuse
chapter
the
ambassadors
ball
one
of
the
most
functions
of
the
year
was
well
under
way
it
was
not
that
everyone
who
was
anyone
was
there
but
everyone
who
was
there
was
in
one
way
or
another
very
emphatically
someone
thus
there
were
affairs
at
which
there
were
more
young
and
beautiful
women
and
more
young
and
handsome
men
but
none
exhibiting
newer
or
more
expensive
gowns
more
ribbons
and
decorations
more
or
costlier
or
more
refined
jewelry
or
a
larger
acreage
of
powdered
and
perfumed
epidermis
and
even
so
the
younger
set
was
well
enough
represented
since
pioneering
appeals
more
to
youth
than
to
age
the
men
representing
the
colonies
were
young
and
their
wives
together
with
the
daughters
and
the
second
or
third
or
fourth
or
occasionally
the
fifth
wives
of
the
human
personages
practically
balanced
the
account
nor
was
the
throng
entirely
human
the
time
had
not
yet
come
of
course
when
monstrosities
from
hundreds
of
other
solar
systems
would
vie
in
numbers
with
the
humanity
present
there
were
however
a
few
martians
on
the
floor
wearing
their
light
robes
du
convention
and
dancing
with
meticulously
mathematical
precision
a
few
venerians
who
did
not
dance
sat
in
state
or
waddled
importantly
about
many
worlds
of
the
solarian
system
and
not
a
few
other
systems
were
represented
one
couple
stood
out
even
against
that
opulent
and
magnificent
background
eyes
followed
them
wherever
they
went
the
girl
was
tall
trim
supple
built
like
a
symphony
her
callistan
gown
of
the
newest
and
most
violent
shade
of
green
was
phosphorescently
luminous
fluorescent
gleaming
and
glowing
its
hem
swept
the
floor
but
above
the
waist
it
vanished
mysteriously
except
for
wisps
which
clung
to
strategic
areas
here
and
there
with
no
support
apparently
except
the
personal
magnetism
of
the
wearer
she
almost
alone
of
all
the
women
there
wore
no
flowers
her
only
jewelry
was
a
rosette
of
huge
emeralds
perched
precariously
upon
her
bare
left
shoulder
her
hair
unlike
the
other
women
flawless
coiffures
was
a
flamboyant
mop
her
soft
and
dewy
eyes
virgilia
samms
could
control
her
eyes
as
perfectly
as
she
could
her
highly
educated
hands
were
at
the
moment
tawny
wells
of
girlish
innocence
and
trust
but
i
give
you
this
next
dance
too
herkimer
i
ca
she
pleaded
snuggling
just
a
trifle
closer
into
the
embrace
of
the
young
man
who
was
just
as
much
man
physically
as
she
was
woman
i
just
to
really
but
i
just
simply
and
you
know
why
too
you
got
some
of
course
i
got
a
list
as
long
as
from
here
to
there
senator
morgan
first
of
course
then
isaacson
then
i
sat
one
out
with
ossmen
i
ca
venerians
they
so
slimy
and
fat
and
repulsive
and
that
leathery
horned
toad
from
mars
and
that
jovian
hippopotamus
she
went
down
the
list
and
as
she
named
or
characterized
each
entity
another
finger
of
her
left
hand
pressed
down
upon
the
back
of
her
partner
right
to
emphasize
the
count
of
her
social
obligations
but
those
talented
fingers
were
doing
more
far
far
more
than
that
herkimer
third
although
no
little
of
a
don
juan
was
a
highly
polished
smoothly
finished
thoroughly
seasoned
diplomat
as
such
his
eyes
and
his
other
features
particularly
his
eyes
had
been
schooled
for
years
to
reveal
no
trace
of
whatever
might
be
going
on
inside
his
brain
if
he
had
entertained
any
suspicion
of
the
beautiful
girl
in
his
arms
if
anyone
had
suggested
that
she
was
trying
her
best
to
pump
him
he
would
have
smiled
the
sort
of
smile
which
only
the
diplomat
can
achieve
he
was
not
suspicious
of
virgilia
samms
however
simply
because
she
was
virgil
samms
daughter
he
took
an
extra
bit
of
pain
to
betray
no
undue
interest
in
any
one
of
the
names
she
recited
and
besides
she
was
not
looking
at
his
eyes
nor
even
at
his
face
her
glance
demurely
downcast
was
all
too
rarely
raised
above
the
level
of
his
chin
there
were
some
things
however
that
herkimer
herkimer
third
did
not
know
that
virgilia
samms
was
the
most
accomplished
of
her
times
that
she
was
so
close
to
him
not
because
of
his
manly
charm
but
because
only
in
that
position
could
she
do
her
prodigious
best
that
she
could
work
with
her
eyes
alone
but
in
emergencies
when
fullest
possible
results
were
imperative
she
had
to
use
her
exquisitely
sensitive
fingers
and
her
exquisitely
tactile
skin
that
she
had
studied
intensively
and
had
tabulated
the
reactions
of
each
of
the
entities
on
her
list
that
she
was
now
with
his
help
fitting
those
reactions
into
a
pattern
and
finally
that
that
pattern
was
beginning
to
assume
the
grim
shape
of
murder
and
virgilia
samms
working
now
for
something
far
more
urgent
and
vastly
more
important
than
a
figmental
galactic
patrol
hoped
desperately
that
this
herkimer
was
not
a
too
for
she
knew
that
she
was
revealing
her
secrets
even
more
completely
than
was
he
in
fact
if
things
got
much
worse
he
could
not
help
but
feel
the
pounding
of
her
heart
but
she
could
explain
that
easily
enough
by
a
few
appropriate
wiggles
no
he
was
a
reader
definitely
not
he
was
watching
the
right
places
he
was
looking
where
that
gown
had
been
designed
to
make
him
look
and
nowhere
else
and
no
muscles
lay
beneath
any
part
of
either
of
his
hands
as
her
eyes
and
her
fingers
and
her
lovely
torso
sent
more
and
more
information
to
her
keen
brain
jill
grew
more
and
more
anxious
she
was
sure
that
murder
was
intended
but
who
was
to
be
the
victim
her
father
probably
pops
kinnison
possibly
somebody
else
barely
possibly
and
when
and
where
and
how
she
and
she
would
have
to
be
mentioning
names
had
been
enough
but
a
personal
appearance
why
dad
show
up
or
did
she
wish
he
would
come
at
all
virgil
samms
entered
the
and
dad
told
me
herkimer
she
cooed
sweetly
gazing
up
into
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
in
over
a
minute
that
i
must
dance
with
every
one
of
them
so
you
see
oh
there
he
is
now
over
there
i
been
wondering
where
he
been
keeping
himself
she
nodded
toward
the
entrance
and
prattled
on
artlessly
he
almost
late
you
know
and
i
he
looked
and
as
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
first
lensman
jill
learned
three
of
the
facts
she
needed
so
badly
to
know
her
father
here
soon
she
never
knew
how
she
managed
to
keep
herself
under
control
but
some
way
and
just
barely
she
did
although
nothing
showed
she
was
seething
inwardly
wrought
up
as
she
had
never
before
been
what
could
she
do
she
but
she
did
not
have
a
scrap
or
an
iota
of
visible
or
tangible
evidence
and
if
she
made
one
single
slip
however
slight
the
consequences
could
be
immediate
and
disastrous
after
this
dance
might
be
too
late
she
could
make
an
excuse
to
leave
the
floor
but
that
would
look
very
bad
later
and
none
of
them
would
lens
her
she
knew
while
she
was
with
herkimer
such
chivalry
she
take
the
chance
of
waving
at
her
father
since
she
had
seen
him
for
so
long
no
the
smallest
risk
would
be
with
mase
he
looked
at
her
every
chance
he
got
and
she
him
use
his
lens
northrop
looked
at
her
and
over
herkimer
shoulder
for
one
fleeting
instant
she
allowed
her
face
to
reveal
the
terrified
appeal
she
so
keenly
felt
want
me
jill
his
lensed
thought
touched
only
the
outer
fringes
of
her
mind
full
rapport
is
more
intimate
than
a
kiss
no
one
except
her
father
had
ever
really
put
a
lens
on
virgilia
samms
nevertheless
you
i
never
wanted
anybody
so
much
in
my
life
come
in
mase
quick
diffidently
enough
he
came
but
at
the
first
inkling
of
the
news
all
thought
of
diffidence
or
of
privacy
vanished
jack
spud
kinnison
mr
samms
he
lensed
sharp
imperative
almost
frantic
thoughts
listen
in
steady
mase
i
take
over
came
roderick
kinnison
deeper
quieter
mental
voice
first
the
matter
of
guns
anybody
except
me
wearing
a
pistol
you
are
spud
yes
sir
you
would
be
but
you
and
mase
jack
we
got
our
lewistons
you
would
have
blasters
my
son
are
fine
weapons
indeed
for
certain
kinds
of
work
in
emergencies
it
is
of
course
permissible
to
kill
a
few
dozen
innocent
bystanders
in
such
a
crowd
as
this
though
it
is
much
better
technique
to
kill
only
the
one
you
are
aiming
at
so
skip
out
to
my
car
you
two
right
now
and
change
and
make
it
everyone
knew
that
roderick
kinnison
car
was
at
all
times
an
arsenal
on
wheels
wish
you
were
in
uniform
too
virge
but
it
ca
be
helped
now
work
your
way
around
to
the
northwest
corner
spud
do
the
same
it
impossible
starkly
unthinkable
and
i
not
of
anything
really
samms
and
his
daughter
began
simultaneously
to
protest
virgil
you
talk
like
a
man
with
a
paper
nose
keep
still
until
after
you
used
your
brain
and
i
sure
enough
of
what
you
know
jill
to
take
plenty
of
steps
you
can
relax
now
take
it
easy
we
covering
virgil
and
i
called
up
support
in
force
you
relax
a
little
i
see
good
i
not
trying
to
hide
from
anybody
that
the
next
few
minutes
may
be
critical
are
you
pretty
sure
jill
that
herkimer
is
a
key
man
pretty
sure
pops
much
better
she
felt
now
that
the
lensmen
were
on
guard
in
this
one
case
at
least
good
then
let
him
talk
you
into
giving
him
every
dance
right
straight
through
until
something
breaks
watch
him
he
must
know
the
signal
and
who
is
going
to
operate
and
if
you
can
give
us
a
fraction
of
a
second
of
warning
it
will
help
no
end
can
do
i
say
i
can
and
i
would
love
to
the
big
slimy
stinking
skinker
as
transliterated
into
words
the
girl
thought
may
seem
a
trifle
confused
but
kinnison
knew
exactly
what
she
meant
one
more
thing
jill
a
detail
the
boys
are
coming
back
in
and
are
working
their
partners
over
this
way
see
if
herkimer
notices
that
they
have
changed
their
holsters
no
he
did
notice
jill
reported
after
a
moment
but
i
notice
any
difference
either
and
i
looking
for
it
nevertheless
it
there
and
the
difference
between
a
mark
seventeen
and
a
mark
five
is
something
more
than
that
between
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
kinnison
returned
dryly
however
it
may
not
be
as
obvious
to
personnel
as
it
is
to
us
that
far
enough
boys
do
get
too
close
now
virge
keep
solidly
en
rapport
with
jill
on
one
side
and
with
us
on
the
other
so
that
she
wo
have
to
give
herself
and
the
show
away
by
yelling
and
pointing
and
but
this
is
preposterous
samms
stormed
preposterous
hell
roderick
kinnison
thought
was
still
coldly
level
only
the
fact
that
he
was
beginning
to
use
language
revealed
any
sign
of
the
strain
he
was
under
stop
being
so
goddam
heroic
and
start
using
your
brain
you
turned
down
fifty
billion
credits
why
do
you
suppose
they
offered
that
much
when
they
can
get
anybody
killed
for
a
hundred
and
what
would
they
do
about
it
but
they
could
get
away
with
it
rod
at
an
ambassadors
ball
they
possibly
formerly
no
that
was
my
first
thought
too
but
it
was
you
who
pointed
out
to
me
not
so
long
ago
that
the
techniques
of
crime
have
changed
of
late
in
the
new
light
the
swankier
the
brawl
the
greater
the
confusion
and
the
better
the
chance
of
getting
away
clean
comb
out
of
your
whiskers
you
mule
well
there
might
be
something
in
it
after
all
samms
thought
showed
apprehension
at
last
you
know
damn
well
there
is
but
you
boys
jack
and
mase
especially
loosen
up
you
ca
do
good
shooting
while
you
strung
up
like
a
couple
of
cocoons
do
something
talk
to
your
partners
or
think
at
jill
that
wo
be
hard
sir
mason
northrop
grinned
feebly
and
that
reminds
me
of
something
jill
mentor
certainly
bracketed
the
target
when
he
or
she
or
it
maybe
said
that
you
would
never
need
a
lens
huh
jill
demanded
inelegantly
i
do
see
the
connection
if
any
no
everybody
else
does
i
bet
how
about
it
the
other
lensmen
even
samms
agreed
enthusiastically
well
do
you
think
that
any
of
those
characters
particularly
herkimer
herkimer
third
would
let
a
harness
bull
in
harness
even
such
a
beautiful
one
as
you
get
close
enough
to
him
to
do
such
a
davey
the
dip
act
on
his
mind
oh
i
never
thought
of
that
but
it
right
and
i
glad
but
pops
you
said
something
about
in
force
have
you
any
idea
how
long
it
will
be
i
i
can
hold
out
with
you
all
supporting
me
but
you
can
jill
two
or
three
minutes
more
at
most
support
in
force
what
do
you
mean
samms
snapped
just
that
the
whole
damned
army
kinnison
replied
i
sent
commodore
alexander
clayton
a
thought
that
lifted
him
right
out
of
his
chair
everything
he
got
at
full
emergency
blast
armor
mark
eighty
fours
six
by
six
extra
heavies
a
ninety
sixty
for
an
ambulance
full
escort
upstairs
and
down
cruisers
and
big
stuff
in
short
the
works
i
would
have
run
with
you
before
this
if
i
dared
but
the
minute
the
relief
party
shows
up
we
do
a
flit
if
you
jill
asked
shaken
by
the
thought
exactly
my
dear
i
do
dare
if
they
start
anything
we
do
our
damnedest
but
i
praying
they
wo
but
kinnison
prayers
if
he
made
any
were
ignored
jill
heard
a
sharp
but
very
usual
and
insignificant
sound
someone
had
dropped
a
pencil
she
felt
an
inconspicuous
muscle
twitch
slightly
she
saw
the
almost
imperceptible
tensing
of
a
which
would
have
turned
herkimer
head
in
a
certain
direction
if
it
had
been
allowed
to
act
her
eyes
flashed
along
that
line
searched
busily
for
a
man
was
reaching
unobtrusively
as
though
for
a
handkerchief
but
men
at
ambassadors
balls
do
not
carry
blue
handkerchiefs
nor
does
any
fabric
however
dyed
resemble
at
all
closely
the
blued
steel
of
an
automatic
pistol
jill
would
have
screamed
then
and
pointed
but
she
had
time
to
do
neither
through
her
rapport
with
her
father
the
lensmen
saw
everything
that
she
saw
in
the
instant
of
her
seeing
it
hence
five
shots
blasted
out
practically
as
one
before
the
girl
could
scream
or
point
or
even
move
she
did
scream
then
but
since
dozens
of
other
women
were
screaming
too
it
made
no
difference
then
conway
costigan
spacehound
that
he
was
and
with
years
of
and
of
brawling
in
his
log
shot
first
even
before
the
gunman
did
it
was
costigan
blinding
speed
that
saved
virgil
samms
life
that
day
for
the
assassin
was
dying
with
a
heavy
slug
crashing
through
his
brain
before
he
finished
pulling
the
trigger
the
dying
hand
twitched
upward
the
bullet
intended
for
heart
went
high
through
the
fleshy
part
of
the
shoulder
roderick
kinnison
because
of
his
age
and
his
son
and
northrop
because
of
their
inexperience
were
a
few
slow
they
however
were
aiming
for
the
body
not
for
the
head
and
any
of
those
three
resulting
wounds
would
have
been
satisfactorily
fatal
the
man
went
down
and
stayed
down
samms
staggered
but
did
not
go
down
until
the
elder
kinnison
as
gently
as
was
consistent
with
the
maximum
of
speed
threw
him
down
stand
back
get
back
give
him
air
men
began
to
shout
the
while
pressing
closer
themselves
you
men
stand
back
some
of
you
go
get
a
stretcher
you
women
come
here
kinnison
heavy
voice
smashed
down
all
lesser
noises
is
there
a
doctor
here
there
was
and
after
being
frisked
for
weapons
he
went
busily
to
work
joy
betty
jill
clio
kinnison
called
his
own
wife
and
their
daughter
virgilia
samms
and
costigan
you
four
first
now
you
and
you
and
you
and
you
he
went
on
pointing
out
large
heavy
women
wearing
extremely
extreme
gowns
stand
here
right
over
him
cover
him
up
so
that
nobody
else
can
get
a
shot
at
him
you
other
women
stand
behind
and
between
these
closer
yet
fill
those
spaces
up
solid
there
jack
stand
there
mase
there
costigan
the
other
end
i
take
this
one
now
everybody
listen
i
know
damn
well
that
none
of
you
women
are
wearing
guns
above
the
waist
and
you
all
got
long
skirts
thank
god
for
ballgowns
now
fellows
if
any
one
of
these
women
makes
a
move
to
lift
her
skirt
blow
her
brains
out
right
then
without
waiting
to
ask
questions
sir
i
protest
this
is
outrageous
one
of
the
dowagers
exclaimed
madam
i
agree
with
you
fully
it
is
kinnison
smiled
as
genuinely
as
he
could
under
the
circumstances
it
is
however
i
will
apologize
to
all
you
ladies
and
to
you
doctor
in
writing
if
you
like
after
we
have
virgil
samms
aboard
the
but
until
then
i
would
not
trust
my
own
grandmother
the
doctor
looked
up
the
this
wound
does
not
appear
to
be
a
very
serious
one
but
this
man
is
going
to
a
hospital
at
once
ah
the
stretcher
so
please
easy
there
that
is
excellent
call
an
ambulance
please
immediately
i
did
long
ago
but
no
hospital
doctor
all
those
windows
open
to
the
public
or
the
whole
place
bombed
by
no
means
i
taking
no
chances
whatever
except
with
your
own
life
jill
put
in
sharply
looking
up
from
her
place
at
her
father
side
assured
that
the
first
lensman
was
in
no
danger
of
dying
she
had
begun
to
take
interest
in
other
things
you
are
important
too
you
know
and
you
standing
right
out
there
in
the
open
get
another
stretcher
lie
down
on
it
and
we
guard
you
too
and
do
be
too
to
take
your
own
advice
she
flared
as
he
hesitated
i
not
if
it
were
necessary
but
it
is
if
they
had
killed
him
yes
i
probably
be
next
in
line
but
since
he
got
only
a
scratch
there
be
no
point
at
all
in
killing
even
a
number
two
a
jill
fairly
seethed
do
you
call
that
horrible
wound
a
huh
why
certainly
that
all
it
is
thanks
to
you
he
returned
in
honest
and
complete
surprise
no
bones
shattered
no
main
arteries
cut
missed
the
lung
he
be
as
good
as
new
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
now
he
went
on
aloud
if
you
ladies
will
please
pick
up
this
stretcher
we
will
move
en
masse
and
toward
the
door
the
women
no
longer
indignant
but
apparently
enjoying
the
sensation
of
being
the
center
of
interest
complied
with
the
request
now
boys
kinnison
lensed
a
thought
did
any
of
you
costigan
see
any
signs
of
a
concerted
rush
such
as
there
would
have
been
to
get
the
killer
away
if
we
had
interfered
no
sir
came
costigan
brisk
reply
none
within
sight
of
me
jack
and
mase
i
do
suppose
you
looked
they
had
had
not
thought
of
it
in
time
you
learn
it
takes
a
few
things
like
this
to
make
it
automatic
but
i
could
see
any
either
so
i
fairly
certain
there
was
any
smart
operators
quick
on
the
uptake
i
better
get
at
this
sir
do
you
think
and
let
operation
boskone
go
for
a
while
costigan
asked
i
do
think
so
kinnison
frowned
in
thought
this
operation
was
son
by
people
with
brains
any
clues
you
could
find
now
would
undoubtedly
be
plants
no
we
let
the
regulars
look
stick
to
our
own
sirens
wailed
and
screamed
outside
kinnison
sent
out
an
exploring
thought
alex
yes
where
do
you
want
this
with
the
doctors
and
nurses
it
too
wide
for
the
gates
go
through
the
wall
across
the
lawn
right
up
to
the
door
and
never
mind
the
frippery
they
got
all
over
the
place
have
your
adjutant
tell
them
to
bill
us
for
damage
samms
is
shot
in
the
shoulder
not
too
serious
but
i
taking
him
to
the
hill
where
i
know
he
be
safe
what
have
you
got
on
top
of
the
umbrella
the
or
the
i
have
had
time
to
look
up
yet
both
good
man
jack
kinnison
started
at
the
monstrous
tank
which
was
smashing
statues
fountains
and
ornamental
trees
flat
into
the
earth
as
it
moved
ponderously
across
the
grounds
and
licked
his
lips
he
looked
at
the
companies
of
soldiers
frisking
the
route
the
grounds
and
the
crowd
higher
up
at
the
hovering
helicopters
still
higher
at
the
eight
light
cruisers
so
evidently
and
so
viciously
ready
to
blast
higher
still
at
the
long
streamers
of
fire
which
he
now
knew
marked
the
locations
of
the
two
most
powerful
engines
of
destruction
ever
built
by
man
and
his
face
turned
slowly
white
good
lord
dad
he
swallowed
twice
i
had
no
idea
but
they
might
at
that
not
son
they
damn
well
would
if
they
could
get
here
soon
enough
with
heavy
enough
stuff
the
elder
kinnison
did
not
loosen
his
darting
eyes
did
not
relax
their
vigilance
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
as
he
lensed
the
thought
you
boys
ca
be
expected
to
know
it
all
but
right
now
you
learning
fast
get
this
paste
it
in
your
iron
hats
samms
life
is
the
most
important
thing
in
this
whole
damned
universe
if
they
had
got
him
then
it
would
not
strictly
speaking
have
been
my
fault
but
if
they
get
him
now
it
will
be
the
land
cruiser
crunched
to
a
stop
against
the
very
entrance
and
a
man
leaped
out
let
me
look
at
him
please
not
yet
kinnison
denied
sharply
not
until
he
got
four
inches
of
solid
steel
between
him
and
whoever
wants
to
finish
the
job
they
started
get
your
men
around
him
and
get
him
aboard
fast
samms
protected
at
every
point
at
every
instant
was
lifted
into
the
maw
of
the
and
as
the
massive
door
clanged
shut
kinnison
heaved
a
tremendous
sigh
of
relief
the
cavalcade
moved
away
coming
with
us
rod
commodore
clayton
shouted
yes
but
got
a
couple
minutes
work
here
yet
have
a
staff
car
wait
for
me
and
i
join
you
he
turned
to
the
three
young
lensmen
and
the
girl
this
fouls
up
our
plans
a
little
but
not
too
much
i
hope
no
change
in
mateese
or
boskone
you
and
costigan
jill
can
go
ahead
as
planned
northrop
you
have
to
brief
jill
on
zwilnik
and
find
out
what
she
knows
virgil
was
going
to
do
it
tonight
after
the
brawl
here
but
you
know
as
much
about
it
now
as
any
of
us
check
with
knobos
dalnalten
and
fletcher
while
virgil
is
laid
up
you
and
jack
may
have
to
work
on
both
zabriska
and
zwilnik
he
lens
you
get
the
dope
then
do
as
you
think
best
get
going
he
strode
away
toward
the
waiting
boskone
zwilnik
jill
demanded
what
gives
what
are
they
jack
we
do
know
yet
maybe
we
going
to
name
a
couple
of
planets
piffle
she
scoffed
can
talk
sense
mase
what
boskone
a
simple
distinctive
pronounceable
coined
word
suggested
i
believe
by
bergenholm
he
began
you
know
what
i
mean
you
she
broke
in
but
was
silenced
by
a
sharply
lensed
thought
from
jack
his
touch
was
very
light
barely
sufficient
to
make
conversation
possible
but
even
so
she
flinched
use
your
brain
jill
you
are
thinking
a
lick
not
that
you
can
be
blamed
for
it
stop
talking
there
may
be
or
listeners
around
this
feels
funny
does
it
he
twitched
mentally
and
went
on
you
already
know
what
operation
mateese
is
since
your
own
dish
politics
operation
zwilnik
is
drugs
vice
and
so
on
operation
boskone
is
pirates
spud
is
running
that
operation
zabriska
is
mase
and
me
checking
some
peculiar
disturbances
in
the
come
in
mase
and
do
your
stuff
i
see
you
later
aboard
clear
ether
jill
young
kinnison
vanished
from
the
fringes
of
her
mind
and
northrop
appeared
and
what
a
difference
his
mind
touched
hers
as
gingerly
as
jack
had
done
as
skittishly
as
instantaneously
ready
to
bolt
away
from
anything
in
the
least
degree
private
however
jack
mind
had
rubbed
hers
the
wrong
way
right
from
the
start
and
mase
did
now
about
this
operation
zwilnik
jill
began
something
else
first
i
could
help
noticing
back
there
that
you
and
jack
well
not
out
of
phase
exactly
or
really
out
of
sync
but
sort
of
well
as
though
she
suggested
not
exactly
might
be
better
like
holding
a
tight
beam
together
when
it
wants
to
fall
apart
so
you
noticed
it
yourself
of
course
but
i
thought
jack
and
i
were
the
only
ones
who
did
like
scratching
a
blackboard
with
your
you
do
it
but
you
awfully
glad
to
stop
and
i
jack
too
darn
it
at
a
distance
and
you
and
i
fit
like
precisely
tuned
circuits
jack
really
meant
it
then
when
he
said
that
you
that
is
he
i
did
quite
believe
it
until
now
but
if
you
know
of
course
what
you
already
done
to
me
jill
block
went
on
full
strength
she
arched
her
eyebrows
and
spoke
aloud
why
i
have
the
idea
of
course
not
that
why
you
using
voice
i
found
out
too
that
i
ca
lie
with
my
mind
i
feel
like
a
heel
and
a
louse
with
so
much
job
ahead
but
you
simply
got
to
tell
me
something
then
whatever
you
say
i
hit
the
job
with
everything
i
got
do
i
get
heaved
out
between
planets
without
a
or
not
i
do
think
so
jill
blushed
vividly
but
her
voice
was
steady
you
would
rate
a
and
enough
oxygen
to
reach
another
plan
another
goal
and
now
we
better
get
to
work
do
you
think
yes
thanks
jill
a
million
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
i
was
talking
out
of
turn
and
how
much
but
i
had
to
know
he
breathed
deep
and
that
all
i
ask
for
now
cut
your
screens
she
lowered
her
mental
barriers
finding
it
surprisingly
easy
to
do
so
in
this
case
let
them
down
almost
as
far
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
with
her
father
he
explained
in
flashing
thoughts
everything
he
knew
of
the
four
operations
concluding
i
not
assigned
to
zabriska
permanently
i
probably
work
with
you
on
mateese
after
your
father
gets
back
into
circulation
i
to
act
more
as
a
liaison
man
neither
knobos
nor
dalnalten
knows
you
well
enough
to
lens
you
right
yes
i
met
knobos
only
once
and
have
never
even
seen
dr
dalnalten
ready
to
visit
them
via
lens
yes
go
ahead
the
two
lensmen
came
in
they
came
into
his
mind
not
hers
nevertheless
their
thoughts
superimposed
upon
northrop
came
to
the
girl
as
clearly
as
though
all
four
were
speaking
to
each
other
face
to
face
what
a
sensation
jill
exclaimed
why
i
never
anything
like
it
we
are
sorry
to
trouble
you
miss
samms
jill
was
surprised
anew
the
silent
voice
deep
within
her
mind
was
of
characteristically
martian
timber
but
instead
of
the
harshly
guttural
consonants
and
the
hissing
sibilants
of
any
martian
best
efforts
at
english
pronunciation
and
enunciation
were
flawless
oh
i
did
mean
that
it
no
trouble
at
all
really
i
just
got
used
to
this
telepathy
yet
none
of
us
has
to
any
noticeable
degree
but
the
reason
for
this
call
is
to
ask
you
if
you
have
anything
new
however
slight
to
add
to
our
very
small
knowledge
of
zwilnik
very
little
i
afraid
and
that
little
is
mostly
guesses
deductions
and
jumpings
at
conclusions
father
told
you
about
the
way
i
work
i
suppose
yes
exact
data
is
not
to
be
expected
hints
suggestions
possible
leads
will
be
of
inestimable
value
well
i
met
a
very
short
very
fat
venerian
named
ossmen
at
a
party
at
the
european
embassy
do
either
of
you
know
him
i
know
of
him
dalnalten
replied
a
highly
reputable
merchant
with
such
large
interests
on
tellus
that
he
has
to
spend
most
of
his
time
here
he
is
not
in
any
one
of
our
books
although
there
is
nothing
at
all
surprising
in
that
fact
go
on
please
miss
samms
he
did
come
to
the
party
with
senator
morgan
but
he
came
to
some
kind
of
an
agreement
with
him
that
night
and
i
am
pretty
sure
that
it
was
about
thionite
that
the
only
new
item
i
have
the
three
lensmen
were
equally
surprised
yes
thionite
definitely
how
are
you
of
this
miss
samms
knobos
asked
in
deadly
earnest
i
am
not
that
this
particular
agreement
was
about
thionite
no
but
the
probability
is
roughly
i
sure
however
that
both
senator
morgan
and
ossmen
know
a
lot
about
thionite
that
they
want
to
hide
both
gave
very
high
positive
reactions
well
beyond
the
point
of
virtual
certainty
there
was
a
pause
broken
by
the
martian
but
not
by
a
thought
directed
at
any
one
of
the
three
sid
he
called
and
even
jill
could
feel
the
lensed
thought
speed
yes
knobos
fletcher
that
you
made
out
in
the
asteroids
heroin
hadive
and
ladolian
was
it
no
thionite
involved
anywhere
no
thionite
however
you
must
remember
that
part
of
the
gang
got
away
so
all
i
can
say
positively
is
that
we
did
see
or
hear
about
any
thionite
there
was
some
gossip
of
course
but
you
know
there
always
is
of
course
thanks
sid
jill
could
feel
the
brilliant
mental
gears
whirl
and
click
then
he
went
into
such
a
flashing
exchange
of
thought
with
the
venerian
that
the
girl
lost
track
in
seconds
one
more
question
miss
samms
dalnalten
asked
have
you
detected
any
indications
that
there
may
be
some
connection
between
either
ossmen
or
morgan
and
any
officer
or
executive
of
interstellar
spaceways
isaacson
jill
caught
her
breath
why
nobody
even
thought
of
such
a
thing
at
least
nobody
ever
mentioned
it
to
me
i
never
thought
of
making
any
such
tests
the
possibility
occurred
to
me
only
a
moment
ago
at
your
mention
of
thionite
the
connection
if
any
exists
will
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
trace
but
since
most
if
not
all
of
the
parties
involved
will
probably
be
included
in
your
operation
mateese
and
since
a
finding
either
positive
or
negative
would
be
tremendously
significant
we
feel
emboldened
to
ask
you
to
keep
this
point
in
mind
why
of
course
i
will
i
be
very
glad
to
we
thank
you
for
your
courtesy
and
your
help
one
or
both
of
us
will
get
in
touch
with
you
from
time
to
time
now
that
we
know
the
pattern
of
your
personality
may
immortal
grolossen
speed
the
healing
of
your
father
wound
chapter
late
that
night
or
rather
very
early
the
following
morning
senator
morgan
and
his
number
one
secretary
were
closeted
in
the
doubly
office
morgan
round
heavy
florid
face
had
perhaps
lost
a
little
of
its
usual
color
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
drummed
soundlessly
upon
the
glass
top
of
his
desk
his
shrewd
gray
eyes
however
were
as
keen
and
as
calculating
as
ever
this
thing
smells
herkimer
it
but
i
ca
figure
any
of
the
angles
that
operation
was
sure
fire
it
miss
right
up
to
the
last
split
second
it
worked
perfectly
then
blooie
a
flat
bust
the
patrol
landed
and
everything
was
under
control
there
have
been
a
leak
somewhere
but
where
in
hell
could
it
have
been
there
could
have
been
a
leak
chief
it
does
make
sense
the
secretary
uncrossed
his
long
legs
recrossed
them
in
the
other
direction
threw
away
a
cigarette
lit
another
if
been
any
kind
of
a
leak
they
would
have
done
a
lot
more
than
just
kill
the
low
man
on
the
ladder
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
rocky
kinnison
is
the
character
this
side
of
hell
if
he
had
known
anything
he
would
have
killed
everybody
in
sight
including
you
and
me
besides
if
there
had
been
a
leak
he
would
not
have
let
samms
get
within
ten
thousand
miles
of
the
place
that
one
sure
thing
another
is
he
would
have
waited
until
after
it
was
all
over
to
get
his
army
there
no
chief
there
could
have
been
a
leak
whatever
samms
or
kinnison
found
out
probably
samms
he
a
hell
of
a
lot
smarter
than
kinnison
is
you
know
he
learned
right
there
and
then
he
must
have
seen
brainerd
start
to
pull
his
gun
i
thought
of
that
i
buy
it
except
for
one
fact
apparently
you
did
time
the
interval
between
the
shots
and
the
arrival
of
the
tanks
sorry
chief
herkimer
face
was
a
study
in
chagrin
i
made
a
bad
slip
there
i
say
you
did
one
minute
and
fifty
eight
seconds
morgan
remained
silent
the
patrol
is
fast
of
course
and
always
ready
and
they
would
yank
the
stuff
in
on
tractor
beams
not
under
their
own
power
but
even
so
five
minutes
is
my
guess
chief
four
and
a
half
absolute
minimum
check
and
where
do
you
go
from
there
i
see
your
point
i
do
that
blows
everything
wide
open
one
set
of
facts
says
there
was
a
leak
which
occurred
between
two
and
a
half
and
three
minutes
before
the
signal
was
given
i
ask
you
chief
does
that
make
sense
no
that
what
is
bothering
me
as
you
say
the
facts
seem
to
be
contradictory
somebody
must
have
learned
something
before
anything
happened
but
if
they
did
why
did
they
do
more
and
murgatroyd
if
they
did
know
about
him
why
the
ships
especially
the
big
battlewagons
if
they
did
think
he
might
be
out
there
somewhere
why
did
they
go
and
find
out
now
i
ask
one
why
did
our
murgatroyd
do
something
or
was
the
pirate
fleet
supposed
to
be
in
on
this
probably
not
though
my
guess
would
be
the
same
as
yours
ca
see
any
reason
for
having
a
fleet
cover
a
operation
especially
as
a
one
as
this
was
but
that
none
of
our
business
these
lensmen
are
i
was
watching
them
every
second
neither
samms
nor
kinnison
did
anything
whatever
during
that
two
minutes
young
kinnison
and
northrop
each
left
the
hall
about
that
time
i
know
it
so
they
did
either
one
of
them
have
called
the
patrol
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
price
of
beef
f
valeria
herkimer
refrained
tactfully
from
answering
the
savage
question
morgan
drummed
and
thought
for
minutes
then
went
on
slowly
there
are
two
and
only
two
possibilities
neither
of
which
seem
even
remotely
possible
it
was
have
been
either
the
lens
or
the
girl
the
girl
act
your
age
senator
i
knew
where
was
and
what
she
was
doing
every
second
that
was
evident
morgan
stopped
drumming
and
smiled
cynically
getting
a
hell
of
a
kick
out
of
seeing
you
taking
it
for
a
change
instead
of
dishing
it
out
yes
herkimer
handsome
face
hardened
that
game
is
over
my
friend
that
what
think
the
senator
jibed
ca
believe
that
any
woman
be
eh
you
been
working
on
her
for
six
weeks
now
instead
of
the
usual
six
hours
and
you
have
got
anywhere
yet
i
will
senator
herkimer
nostrils
flared
viciously
i
get
her
one
way
or
another
if
it
the
last
thing
i
ever
do
i
give
you
eight
to
five
you
do
and
a
time
limit
i
take
five
thousand
of
that
but
what
makes
you
think
that
anything
to
be
afraid
of
she
a
trained
psychologist
yes
but
so
am
i
and
i
older
and
more
experienced
than
she
is
that
leaves
that
yoga
stuff
her
learning
how
to
sit
how
to
contemplate
her
navel
and
how
to
try
to
get
in
tune
with
the
infinite
how
do
you
figure
puts
her
in
my
class
i
told
you
i
do
nothing
makes
sense
but
she
is
virgil
daughter
what
of
it
you
did
gag
on
george
olmstead
you
picked
him
yourself
for
one
of
the
toughest
jobs
we
got
by
blood
he
just
about
as
close
to
virgil
samms
as
virgilia
is
they
might
as
well
have
been
hatched
out
of
the
same
egg
physically
yes
mentally
and
psychologically
no
olmstead
is
a
realist
a
materialist
he
wants
his
reward
in
this
world
not
the
next
and
is
out
to
get
it
furthermore
the
job
will
probably
kill
him
and
even
if
it
does
he
will
never
be
in
a
position
of
trust
or
where
he
can
learn
much
of
anything
on
the
other
hand
virgil
samms
is
but
i
do
need
to
tell
you
what
is
like
but
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
she
just
like
him
she
is
playing
around
with
you
because
of
your
overpowering
charm
listen
chief
she
did
know
anything
and
she
did
do
anything
i
was
dancing
with
her
all
the
time
as
close
as
that
he
clasped
his
hands
tightly
together
so
i
know
what
i
talking
about
and
if
you
think
she
could
learn
anything
from
me
skip
it
you
know
that
nobody
on
earth
or
anywhere
else
can
read
my
face
and
besides
she
was
playing
coy
right
then
was
even
looking
at
me
so
count
her
out
we
have
to
i
guess
morgan
resumed
his
quiet
drumming
if
there
were
any
possibility
that
she
pumped
you
i
send
you
to
the
mines
but
there
no
sign
that
leaves
the
lens
it
has
seemed
right
along
more
logical
than
the
girl
but
a
lot
more
fantastic
been
able
to
find
out
anything
more
about
it
no
just
what
they
been
advertising
combination
automatic
telepath
and
so
on
badge
of
the
top
skimmings
of
the
cops
but
i
began
to
think
out
there
on
the
floor
that
they
are
advertising
everything
they
know
so
did
i
you
tell
me
take
the
time
zero
minus
three
minutes
besides
the
five
lensmen
and
jill
samms
the
place
was
full
of
top
brass
scrambled
eggs
all
over
the
floor
commodores
and
from
all
continental
governments
of
the
earth
the
other
planets
and
the
colonies
all
wearing
nobody
knew
anything
then
we
agree
on
that
but
within
the
next
few
seconds
somebody
found
out
something
and
called
for
help
one
of
the
lensmen
could
possibly
have
done
that
without
showing
signs
but
at
zero
time
all
four
lensmen
had
their
guns
out
and
lewistons
please
note
and
were
shooting
whereas
none
of
the
other
armed
officers
knew
that
anything
was
going
on
until
after
it
was
all
over
that
puts
the
finger
on
the
lens
that
the
way
i
figured
it
but
the
difficulties
remain
unchanged
herkimer
snorted
my
mind
ca
be
read
nor
mine
and
besides
if
they
could
read
minds
they
would
have
waited
until
the
last
possible
split
second
to
do
it
unless
say
wait
a
minute
did
brainerd
act
or
look
nervous
toward
the
last
i
to
look
at
him
you
know
not
nervous
exactly
but
he
did
get
a
little
tense
there
you
are
then
hired
murderers
are
smart
a
lensman
saw
him
tighten
up
and
got
suspicious
turned
in
the
alarm
on
general
principles
warned
the
others
to
keep
on
their
toes
but
even
so
it
does
look
like
they
have
killed
him
sooner
they
were
watchful
and
mighty
quick
on
the
draw
that
could
be
it
that
about
as
thin
and
as
specious
an
explanation
as
i
ever
saw
cooked
up
but
it
cover
the
facts
and
the
two
of
us
will
be
able
to
make
it
stick
but
take
notice
pretty
boy
that
certain
parties
are
not
going
to
like
this
at
all
in
fact
they
are
going
to
be
very
highly
put
out
that
a
nice
hunk
of
understatement
boss
but
notice
one
beautiful
thing
about
this
story
herkimer
grinned
maliciously
it
lets
us
pass
the
buck
to
big
jim
towne
we
can
be
and
will
be
sore
as
hell
because
he
picks
such
characters
to
do
his
killings
in
the
heavily
armored
improvised
ambulance
virgil
samms
sat
up
and
directed
a
thought
at
his
friend
kinnison
finding
his
mind
a
turmoil
of
confusion
what
the
matter
rod
plenty
the
big
lensman
snapped
back
they
were
maybe
still
are
too
damn
far
ahead
of
us
something
has
been
going
on
that
we
have
even
suspected
i
stood
by
as
innocent
as
a
girl
baby
and
let
you
walk
right
into
that
one
and
i
emphatically
do
not
enjoy
getting
caught
with
my
pants
down
that
way
it
makes
me
jumpy
this
may
be
all
but
it
may
not
be
not
by
eleven
thousand
and
i
trying
to
dope
out
what
is
going
to
happen
next
and
what
have
you
deduced
nothing
i
stuck
so
i
tossing
it
into
your
lap
besides
what
you
are
getting
paid
for
thinking
so
go
ahead
and
think
what
would
you
be
doing
if
you
were
on
the
other
side
i
see
you
think
then
that
it
might
not
be
good
technique
to
take
the
time
to
go
back
to
the
spaceport
you
get
the
idea
but
can
you
stand
transfer
certainly
they
got
my
shoulder
dressed
and
taped
and
my
arm
in
a
sling
shock
practically
all
gone
some
pain
but
not
much
i
can
walk
without
falling
down
fair
enough
clayton
he
lensed
a
vigorous
thought
have
any
of
the
observers
spotted
anything
high
up
or
far
off
no
sir
good
kinnison
to
commodore
clayton
orders
have
a
come
down
and
pick
up
samms
and
myself
on
tractors
instruct
the
and
the
cruisers
to
maintain
utmost
vigilance
instruct
the
to
pick
us
up
detach
the
and
the
from
your
task
force
assign
them
to
me
off
clayton
to
commissioner
kinnison
orders
received
and
are
being
carried
out
off
the
transfers
were
made
without
incident
the
two
leaped
into
the
high
stratosphere
and
tore
westward
to
the
hill
kinnison
called
frederick
rodebush
fred
kinnison
have
cleve
and
bergenholm
link
up
with
us
now
how
are
the
geigers
on
the
outside
of
the
hill
behaving
normal
all
of
them
the
reported
after
a
moment
why
kinnison
detailed
the
happenings
of
the
recent
past
so
tell
the
boys
to
unlimber
all
the
stuff
the
hill
has
got
my
god
cleveland
exclaimed
why
that
putting
us
back
to
the
days
of
the
interplanetary
wars
with
one
notable
exception
kinnison
pointed
out
the
attack
if
any
will
be
strictly
modern
i
hope
we
be
able
to
handle
it
one
good
thing
the
old
mountain
got
a
lot
of
sheer
mass
how
much
radioactivity
will
it
stand
allotropic
iron
or
plutonium
rodebush
seized
his
what
difference
does
it
make
from
a
practical
standpoint
perhaps
none
but
with
a
task
force
defending
not
many
bombs
could
get
through
so
i
say
i
was
thinking
so
much
of
bombs
what
then
isotopes
a
good
thick
blanket
of
dust
fine
stuff
that
neither
our
ships
nor
the
hill
screens
could
handle
we
got
to
decide
first
whether
virgil
will
be
safer
there
in
the
hill
or
out
in
space
in
the
and
second
for
how
long
i
see
i
say
here
the
hill
months
perhaps
years
before
anything
could
work
down
this
far
and
we
can
get
out
no
matter
how
hot
the
surface
gets
we
got
enough
screen
heavy
water
cadmium
lead
mercury
and
everything
else
necessary
to
get
him
out
through
the
locks
that
what
i
was
hoping
you
say
and
now
about
the
defense
i
wonder
i
do
want
everybody
to
think
i
gone
completely
hysterical
but
i
be
damned
if
i
want
to
get
caught
again
with
his
thought
faded
out
may
i
offer
a
suggestion
sir
bergenholm
thought
broke
the
prolonged
silence
i
be
very
glad
to
have
it
your
suggestions
so
far
have
been
idle
vaporings
another
hunch
no
sir
a
logical
procedure
it
has
been
some
months
since
the
last
emergency
drill
was
held
if
you
issue
such
another
call
now
and
nothing
happens
it
can
be
simply
another
surprise
drill
with
credit
promotion
and
monetary
awards
for
the
best
performances
further
practice
and
instruction
for
the
less
proficient
units
splendid
dr
bergenholm
samms
brilliant
and
agile
mind
snatched
up
the
thought
and
carried
it
along
and
what
a
chance
rod
for
something
vastly
larger
and
more
important
than
a
continental
or
even
a
tellurian
drill
make
it
the
first
maneuver
of
the
galactic
patrol
i
like
to
virge
but
we
ca
my
boys
are
ready
but
you
are
no
top
appointments
and
no
authority
that
can
be
arranged
in
a
very
few
minutes
we
have
been
waiting
for
the
psychological
moment
this
especially
if
trouble
should
develop
is
the
time
you
yourself
expect
an
attack
do
you
not
yes
i
would
not
start
anything
unless
and
until
i
was
ready
to
finish
it
and
i
see
no
reason
for
assuming
that
whoever
it
was
that
tried
to
kill
you
is
not
at
least
as
good
a
planner
as
i
am
and
the
rest
of
you
dr
bergenholm
my
reasoning
while
it
does
not
exactly
parallel
that
of
commissioner
kinnison
leads
to
the
same
conclusion
that
an
attack
in
great
force
is
to
be
expected
not
parallel
kinnison
demanded
in
what
respects
you
do
not
seem
to
have
considered
the
possibility
commissioner
that
the
proposed
assassination
of
first
lensman
samms
could
very
well
have
been
only
the
first
step
in
a
comprehensive
operation
i
did
and
it
have
been
so
go
ahead
virge
with
the
thought
was
never
finished
for
samms
had
already
gone
ahead
simultaneously
it
seemed
the
minds
of
eight
other
lensmen
joined
the
group
of
tellurians
samms
intensely
serious
spoke
aloud
to
his
friend
the
galactic
council
is
now
assembled
do
you
roderick
kinnison
promise
to
uphold
in
as
much
as
you
conscientiously
can
and
with
all
that
in
you
lies
the
authority
of
this
council
throughout
all
space
i
promise
by
virtue
of
the
authority
vested
in
me
its
president
by
the
galactic
council
i
appoint
you
port
admiral
of
the
galactic
patrol
my
fellow
councillors
are
now
inducting
the
armed
forces
of
their
various
solar
systems
into
the
galactic
patrol
it
will
not
take
long
there
you
may
make
your
appointments
and
issue
orders
for
the
mobilization
the
two
were
now
approaching
the
hill
the
stayed
up
on
top
the
went
down
kinnison
however
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
landing
or
to
samms
disembarkation
and
none
whatever
to
the
reascent
into
the
high
heavens
he
knew
that
everything
was
under
control
and
now
alone
in
his
cabin
he
was
busy
all
personnel
of
all
armed
forces
just
inducted
into
the
galactic
patrol
attention
he
spoke
into
an
microphone
the
familiar
rasp
very
evident
in
his
deep
and
resonant
voice
kinnison
of
tellus
port
admiral
speaking
each
of
you
has
taken
oath
to
the
galactic

they
had
at
ease
the
organization
chart
already
in
your
hands
is
made
effective
as
of
now
enter
in
your
logs
the
date
and
time
promotions
commodore
clayton
of
north
america
tellus
in
his
office
at
new
york
spaceport
clayton
came
to
attention
and
saluted
crisply
his
eyes
shining
his
face
alight
to
be
admiral
of
the
first
galactic
region
commodore
schweikert
of
europe
tellus
in
berlin
a
almost
man
with
roached
blond
hair
and
blue
eyes
bowed
stiffly
from
the
waist
and
saluted
punctiliously
to
be
of
the
first
galactic
region
and
so
on
down
the
list
a
marshal
and
a
of
the
solarian
system
a
general
and
a
of
the
planet
sol
three
promotions
agreed
upon
long
since
to
fill
the
high
offices
thus
vacated

the
of

of
a
world
each
of
these
was
made
general
of
his
planet
except
for
and
up
who
will
tune
their
minds
to
me
dismissed
kinnison
stopped
talking
and
went
onto
his
lens
that
was
for
the
record
i
do
need
to
tell
you
fellows
how
glad
i
am
to
be
able
to
do
this
you
tops
all
of
you
i
do
know
of
anybody
i
rather
have
at
my
back
when
the
ether
gets
rough
right
back
at
you
chief
same
to
you
rod
rocky
rod
port
admiral
now
we
blasting
came
a
melange
of
thoughts
those
splendid
men
with
whom
he
had
shared
so
much
of
danger
and
of
stress
were
all
as
jubilant
as
schoolboys
but
the
thing
that
makes
this
possible
may
also
make
it
necessary
for
us
to
go
to
work
to
earn
your
extra
stars
and
my
wheel
kinnison
smothered
the
welter
of
thoughts
and
outlined
the
situation
concluding
so
you
see
it
may
turn
out
to
be
only
a
drill
but
on
the
other
hand
since
the
outfit
is
big
enough
to
have
built
a
alone
if
it
wanted
one
and
since
it
may
have
had
a
lot
of
help
that
none
of
us
knows
anything
about
we
may
be
in
for
the
damndest
battle
that
any
of
us
ever
saw
so
come
prepared
for
i
am
now
going
back
onto

for

the

to
wait
that
he
is
to
take
you
down
to

what
of

this
was
a
thought
and
unrecorded
sorry
rod
i
sorry
as
hell
and
i
like
no
end
to
have
you
along
this
too
was
a

but
that
the

stay
aground
i
report

and
you

i
see

then
lensed
a
fuming
thought
at
samms
alex
do
this
to
me
and
would
and
knows
damn
well
that
burn
him
to
a
crisp
if
he
had
the
guts
to
try
it
so
it
doing
what
in
hell
the
big
idea
who
being
heroic
now
rod
samms
asked
quietly
use
brain
and
then
come
down
here
where
you
belong
and
kinnison
after
a
long
moment
of
rebellious
thought
and
with
as
much
grace
as
he
could
muster
came
down
down
not
only
to
the
familiar
offices
but
down
into
the
deepest
crypts
beneath
them
he
was
glum
enough
and
bitter
at
first
but
he
found
much
to
do
grand
fleet
headquarters
headquarters
was
being
organized
and
the
best
efforts
of
the
best
minds
and
of
the
best
technologists
of
three
worlds
were
being
devoted
to
the
task
of
strengthening
the
already
extremely
strong
defenses
of
the
hill
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
plates
of
gfhq
showed
that
admiral
clayton
and
schweikert
were
doing
a
very
nice
job
all
of
the
really
heavy
stuff
was
of
earth
the
mother
planet
and
was
already
in
place
as
were
the
less
numerous
and
much
lighter
contingents
of
mars
of
venus
and
of
jove
and
the
fleets
of
the
outlying
solar
systems
cutters
scouts
and
a
few
light
cruisers
were
neither
maintaining
fleet
formation
nor
laying
course
for
sol
instead
each
individual
vessel
was
blasting
at
maximum
for
the
position
in
space
in
which
it
would
form
one
unit
of
a
formation
englobing
at
a
distance
of
the
entire
solarian
system
and
each
of
those
hurtling
hundreds
of
ships
was
literally
combing
all
circumambient
space
with
its
detector
beams
nice
kinnison
turned
to
samms
now
beside
him
at
the
master
plate
could
have
done
any
better
myself
after
you
get
it
made
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
in
case
nothing
happens
samms
was
still
somewhat
skeptical
how
long
can
you
make
a
drill
last
until
all
the
ensigns
have
long
gray
whiskers
if
i
have
to
but
worry
if
we
have
time
to
get
the
preliminary
globe
made
i
be
the
surprisedest
man
in
the
system
and
kinnison
was
not
surprised
before
full
englobement
was
accomplished
a
gave
tongue
flagship
to
grand
fleet
headquarters
it
blatted
sharply
the
black
fleet
has
been
detected
ra
twelve
hours
declination
plus
twenty
degrees
distance
about
thirty
kinnison
started
to
say
something
then
by
main
force
shut
himself
up
he
wanted
intensely
to
take
over
to
tell
the
boys
out
there
exactly
what
to
do
but
he
could
he
was
now
a
big
shot
damn
the
luck
he
could
be
and
must
be
responsible
for
broad
policy
and
for
general
strategy
but
once
those
vitally
important
decisions
had
been
made
the
actual
work
would
have
to
be
done
by
others
he
did
like
it
but
there
it
was
those
flashing
thoughts
took
only
an
instant
of
time
which
is
such
extreme
range
that
no
estimate
of
strength
or
composition
can
be
made
at
present
we
will
keep
you
informed
acknowledge
he
ordered
randolph
who
wearing
now
the
five
silver
bars
of
major
was
his
chief
communications
officer
no
instructions
he
turned
to
his
plate
clayton
had
had
to
be
told
to
pull
in
his
light
stuff
it
was
all
pelting
for
sol
and
tellus
three
general
plans
of
battle
had
been
mapped
out
by
staff
each
had
its
advantages
and
its
disadvantages
operation
acorn
long
distance
would
be
fought
at
say
twelve
it
would
keep
everything
particularly
the
big
stuff
away
from
the
hill
and
would
make
automatics
useless
some
got
past
or
the
automatics
were
coming
in
on
a
sneak
course
or
several
other
things
in
any
one
of
which
cases
a
shellacking
the
hill
would
take
he
grinned
wryly
at
samms
who
had
been
following
his
thought
and
quoted
a
vast
hemisphere
of
lambent
violet
flame
through
which
neither
material
substance
nor
destructive
ray
can
pass
well
that
dedicatory
statement
while
perhaps
a
bit
florid
was
strictly
true
at
the
time
before
the
days
of
allotropic
iron
and
of
polycyclic
drills
now
i
quote
one
is
permanent
except
change
and
kinnison
returned
to
his
thinking
operation
adack
middle
distance
he
did
like
it
any
better
now
than
he
had
before
even
though
some
of
the
big
brains
of
staff
thought
it
the
ideal
solution
a
compromise
all
of
the
disadvantages
of
both
of
the
others
and
none
of
the
advantages
of
either
it
stunk
and
unless
the
black
fleet
had
an
utterly
fantastic
composition
operation
adack
was
out
and
virgil
samms
quietly
smoking
a
cigarette
smiled
inwardly
rod
the
rock
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
be
in
favor
of
any
sort
of
compromise
that
left
operation
affick
close
up
it
had
three
tremendous
advantages
first
the
hill
own
offensive
weapons
as
long
as
they
lasted
second
the
new
fields
third
no
sneak
attack
could
be
made
without
detection
and
interception
it
had
one
tremendous
disadvantage
some
stuff
and
probably
a
lot
of
it
would
get
through
automatics
robots
guided
missiles
equipped
with
drives
with
polycyclic
drills
and
with
atomic
strong
enough
to
shake
the
whole
world
but
with
those
new
fields
shaking
the
world
would
be
enough
in
order
to
get
deep
enough
to
reach
virgil
samms
they
would
damn
near
have
to
destroy
the
world
could
build
a
bomb
that
powerful
he
did
think
so
earth
technology
was
supreme
throughout
all
known
space
of
earth
technologists
the
north
americans
were
and
always
had
been
tops
grant
that
the
black
fleet
was
basically
north
american
grant
further
that
they
had
a
man
as
good
as
adlington
or
that
they
could
adlington
brain
and
laboratories
and
shops
a
tall
order
adlington
himself
was
several
months
away
from
a
unless
he
could
put
one
a
hundred
miles
down
before
detonation
which
simply
was
not
feasible
he
turned
to
samms
it
be
affick
virge
unless
they
got
a
composition
that
is
radically
different
from
anything
i
ever
saw
put
into
space
so
i
ca
say
that
i
am
very
much
surprised
the
calm
statement
and
the
equally
calm
reply
were
beautifully
characteristic
of
the
two
men
kinnison
had
not
asked
nor
had
samms
offered
advice
kinnison
after
weighing
the
facts
made
his
decision
samms
calmly
certain
that
the
decision
was
the
best
that
could
be
made
upon
the
data
available
accepted
it
without
question
or
criticism
we
still
got
a
minute
or
two
kinnison
remarked
do
quite
know
what
to
make
of
their
line
of
approach
coma
berenices
i
do
know
of
anything
at
all
out
that
way
do
you
they
could
have
detoured
though
no
i
do
samms
frowned
in
thought
probably
a
detour
check
kinnison
turned
to
randolph
tell
them
to
report
whatever
they
know
we
ca
wait
any
as
he
was
speaking
the
report
came
in
the
black
fleet
was
of
more
or
less
normal
considerably
larger
than
the
north
american
contingent
but
decidedly
inferior
to
the
patrol
present
grand
fleet
either
three
or
four
capital
ships
and
we
got
six
kinnison
said
exultantly
our
own
two
africa
south
america
and
europe
battle
cruisers
and
heavy
cruisers
about
in
the
usual
proportions
but
an
unusually
high
ratio
of
scouts
and
light
cruisers
there
were
either
two
or
three
large
ships
which
could
not
be
classified
definitely
at
that
distance
observers
were
going
out
to
study
them
tell
clayton
kinnison
instructed
randolph
that
it
is
to
be
operation
affick
and
for
him
to
fly
at
it
report
continued
the
speaker
came
to
life
again
there
are
three
capital
ships
apparently
of
approximately
the
class
but
instead
of
spherical
ouch
kinnison
flashed
a
thought
at
samms
i
do
like
that
they
can
both
fight
and
run
the
battle
cruisers
are
also
the
small
vessels
are
there
are
three
of
the
large
ships
which
we
are
still
not
able
to
classify
definitely
they
are
spherical
in
shape
and
very
large
but
do
not
seem
to
be
either
armed
or
screened
and
are
apparently
carriers
possibly
of
automatics
we
are
now
making
contact
off
instead
of
looking
at
the
plates
before
them
the
two
lensmen
went
en
rapport
with
clayton
so
that
they
could
see
everything
he
saw
the
stupendous
cone
of
battle
had
long
since
been
formed
the
word
to
fire
was
given
in
a
measured
call
every
firing
officer
in
every
patrol
ship
touched
his
stud
in
the
same
split
second
and
from
the
gargantuan
mouth
of
the
cone
there
spewed
a
column
of
energy
so
raw
so
stark
so
incomprehensibly
violent
that
it
must
have
been
seen
to
be
even
dimly
appreciated
it
simply
can
not
be
described
its
prototype
triplanetary
cylinder
of
annihilation
had
been
a
highly
effective
weapon
indeed
the
offensive
beams
of
the
nevian
cruisers
of
the
void
were
even
more
powerful
the
projectors
developed
aboard
the
original
on
the
long
nevian
way
were
stronger
still
the
composite
beam
projected
by
this
fleet
of
the
galactic
patrol
however
was
the
sublimation
and
quintessence
of
each
of
these
redesigned
and
redesigned
by
scientists
and
engineers
of
knowledge
rebuilt
and
rebuilt
by
technologists
of
skill
capital
ships
and
a
few
of
the
heaviest
cruisers
could
mount
screen
generators
able
to
carry
that
frightful
load
but
every
smaller
ship
caught
in
that
rod
of
indescribably
incandescent
fury
simply
flared
into
nothingness
but
in
the
instant
before
the
firing
order
was
given
as
though
precisely
timed
which
in
all
probability
was
the
case
the
observers
picked
up
two
items
of
fact
which
made
the
new
admiral
of
the
first
galactic
region
cut
his
almost
irresistible
weapon
and
break
up
his
cone
of
battle
after
only
a
few
seconds
of
action
one
those
three
enigmatic
cargo
scows
had
fallen
apart
the
beam
reached
them
and
hundreds
yes
thousands
of
small
objects
had
hurtled
radially
outward
out
well
beyond
the
field
of
action
of
the
patrol
beam
at
a
speed
many
times
that
of
light
two
forebodings
had
been
prophetic
a
swarm
of
blacks
all
small
must
have
been
hidden
right
on
earth
somewhere
were
already
darting
at
the
hill

clayton
rapped
into

microphone

dreadful

if
possible
and
attack
black
number
one
and
number

and
number
three
space
was
full
of
darting
flashing
madly
warring
ships
the
three
black
leaped
forward
as
one
their
massed
batteries
of
beams
precisely
synchronized
and
aimed
lashed
out
as
one
at
the
nearest

super

vicious

of

flared
through

and
into
the
black
her
chief
pilot
however
was
fast
fast
and
he
had
a
fraction
of
a
second
in
which
to
work
thus
practically
in
the
instant
of
her
failure
she
went
free
and
while
she
was
holed
badly
and
put
out
of
action
she
was
not
blown
out
of
space
in
fact
it
was
learned
later
that
she
lost
only
forty
men
the
blacks
were
not
as
fortunate

with

a
short
later

and
in
that
very
short

of

ceased
utterly
to
be
but
also
in
that
scant
second
of
time
black

canny

with
no

ordered

at

she
was
already
of
a
about
one
hundred
thousand
million
miles
away
from
the
earth
and
was
devoting
her
every
energy
to
the
accumulation
of
still
more
distance
clayton
barked
savagely
get
him
he
wanted
intensely
to
join
the
chase
but
he
could
he
had
to
stay
here
and
he
did
have
time
even
to
swear
instead
without
a
break
the
words
tripping
over
each
other
against
his
teeth
act
at
will
against
heaviest
craft
left
blast
down
he
gritted
his
teeth
the
scouts
and
light
cruisers
were
doing
their
damndest
but
they
were
three
to
one
christ
what
a
lot
of
stuff
was
getting
through
the
blacks
would
last
long
between
the
hill
and
the
heavies
but
maybe
long
enough
at
that
the
patrol
globe
was
leaking
like
a
sieve
he
voiced
a
couple
of
bursts
of
profanity
and
although
he
was
almost
afraid
to
look
sneaked
a
quick
peek
to
see
how
much
was
left
of
the
hill
he
looked
and
stopped
swearing
in
the
middle
of
a
word
what
he
saw
simply
did
not
make
sense
those
black
bombs
should
have
peeled
the
armor
off
of
that
mountain
like
the
skin
off
of
a
nectarine
and
scattered
it
from
the
pacific
to
the
mississippi
by
now
there
should
be
a
hole
a
mile
deep
where
the
hill
had
been
but
there
was
the
hill
was
still
there
it
might
have
shrunk
a
little
clayton
could
see
very
well
because
of
the
radiance
of
the
practically
continuous
atomic
detonations
the
hill
was
still
and
as
he
stared
chilled
and
shaken
at
that
indescribably
terrific
spectacle
a
black
cruiser
holed
and
helpless
fell
toward
that
armored
mountain
with
an
acceleration
starkly
impossible
to
credit
and
when
it
struck
it
did
not
penetrate
and
splash
and
crater
as
it
should
have
done
instead
it
simply
spread
out
a
thin
over
an
acre
or
so
of
the
fortress
steep
and
apparently
still
armored
surface
you
saw
that
alex
good
otherwise
you
could
scarcely
believe
it
came
kinnison
silent
voice
tell
all
our
ships
to
stay
away
a
force
of
over
a
hundred
thousand
g
acting
in
a
direction
normal
to
every
point
of
our
surface
the
boys
are
giving
it
all
the

they
can
somewhere
between

cube
and
fourth

but
even
so
it
pretty
fierce

how
about

and
the
not
having
much
luck
catching

they
why
i
do
know
i
check
no

they
are
they
report
that
they

was
afraid
so
from

who

coming

and
rebuild

admiral
kinnison
shortly
after
directing
the
foregoing
thought
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smiled
the
battle

practically
over
the
hill

come
through
the
fields
had
held
her
together
through
the
most
session
of
saturation
atomic
bombing
that
any
world
had
ever
seen
or
that
the
mind
of
man
had
ever
conceived
and
the
had
kept
the
interior
rock
from
flowing
like
water
so
far
so
good
her
original
armor
was
gone
converted
into
what
for
hundreds
of
feet
inward
from
the
surface
she
was
hotter
than
the
reacting
slugs
of
the
hanfords
delousing
her
would
be
a
project
not
an
operation
millions
of
cubic
yards
of
material
would
have
to
be
hauled
off
into

with
tractors
and
allowed
to
simmer
for
a

hundred
years
but
what
of
that
bergenholm
had
said
that
the

would
tend
to
prevent

from

as
they
otherwise
would
and
samms
was
still

along
he
took
the
first
lensman
by
his
good
arm
and
lifted
him
out
of
his
chair
old
doctor
kinnison
peerless
prescription
for
you
and
me
is
a
big
thick
juicy
porterhouse
steak
chapter
that
murderous
attack
upon
virgil
samms
and
its
countering
by
those
new
the
lensmen
and
by
an
entire
task
force
of
the
north
american
armed
forces
was
news
of
importance
as
such
it
filled
every
channel
of
universal
telenews
for
an
hour
then
in
stunning
and
crescendo
succession
came
the
staccato
reports
of
the
creation
of
the
galactic
patrol
the
mobilization
allegedly
for
maneuvers
of
galactic
patrol
grand
fleet
and
the
ultimately
desperate
and
successful
attack
upon
the
hill
just
a
second
folks
we
have
it
very
shortly
you
see
something
that
nobody
ever
saw
before
and
that
nobody
will
ever
see
again
getting
in
as
close
as
the
law
will
let
us
the
eyes
of
telenews
ace
reporter
and
the
telephoto
lens
of
his
cameraman
stared
down
from
a
scooter
at
the
furiously
smoking
sputteringly
incandescent
surface
of
triplanetary
ancient
citadel
while
upon
dozens
of
worlds
thousands
of
millions
of
people
packed
themselves
tighter
and
tighter
around
tens
of
millions
of
visiplates
and
in
order
to
see
and
to
hear
the
tremendous
news
there
it
is
folks
look
at
it
the
only
really
impregnable
fortress
ever
built
by
man
a
good
many
of
our
experts
had
it
written
off
as
obsolete
long
ago
but
it
seems
these
lensmen
had
something
up
their
sleeves
besides
their
arms
and
speaking
of
lensmen
they
have
been
throwing
their
weight
around
so
most
of
us
noticed
them
very
much
but
this
reporter
wants
to
go
on
record
right
now
as
saying
there
must
be
a
lot
more
to
the
lens
than
any
of
us
has
thought
because
otherwise
nobody
would
have
gone
to
all
that
trouble
and
expense
to
say
nothing
of
the
tremendous
loss
of
life
just
to
kill
the
chief
lensman
which
seems
to
have
been
what
they
were
after
we
told
you
a
few
minutes
ago
you
know
that
every
continent
of
civilization
sent
official
messages
denying
most
emphatically
any
connection
with
this
outrage
it
still
a
mystery
folks
in
fact
it
is
getting
more
and
more
mysterious
all
the
time
one
single
man
of
the
black
fleet
was
taken
alive
not
even
in
the
ships
that
were
only
holed
they
blew
themselves
up
and
there
were
no
uniforms
or
books
or
anything
of
the
kind
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
wrecks
no
identification
whatever
and
now
for
the
scoop
of
all
time
universal
telenews
has
obtained
permission
to
interview
the
two
top
lensmen
both
of
whom
you
all
know
virgil
samms
and
the
rock
kinnison
personally
for
this
beam
we
are
now
going
down
by
remote
control
of
course
right
into
the
galactic
patrol
office
right
in
the
hill
itself
here
we
are
now
if
you
will
step
just
a
little
closer
to
the
mike
please
samms
or
should
i
say
you
should
say
lensman
samms
kinnison
said
bruskly
oh
yes
first
lensman
samms
thank
you
kinnison
now
first
lensman
samms
our
clients
all
want
to
know
all
about
the
lens
we
all
know
what
it
but
what
really
it
who
invented
it
how
does
it
work
kinnison
started
to
say
something
but
samms
silenced
him
with
a
thought
i
will
answer
those
questions
by
asking
you
one
samms
smiled
disarmingly
do
you
remember
what
happened
because
the
pirates
learned
to
duplicate
the
golden
meteor
of
the
triplanetary
service
oh
i
see
the
telenews
ace
although
brash
and
not
at
all
was
quick
on
the
uptake
t
top
secret
very
much
so
samms
confirmed
and
we
are
going
to
keep
some
things
about
the
lens
secret
as
long
as
we
possibly
can
fair
enough
sorry
folks
but
you
will
agree
that
they
right
on
that
well
then
samms
who
do
you
think
it
was
that
tried
to
kill
you
and
where
do
you
think
the
black
fleet
came
from
i
have
no
idea
samms
said
slowly
and
thoughtfully
no
no
idea
whatever
what
are
you
of
that
are
you
holding
back
maybe
just
a
little
bit
of
a
suspicion
for
diplomatic
reasons
i
am
holding
nothing
back
and
through
my
lens
i
can
make
you
certain
of
the
fact
lensed
thoughts
come
from
the
mind
itself
direct
not
through
such
voluntary
muscles
as
the
tongue
the
mind
does
not
lie
even
such
lies
as
you
call
the
lensman
demonstrated
and
the
reporter
went
on
he
is
folks
which
fact
knocked
me
speechless
for
a
second
or
two
which
is
quite
a
feat
in
itself
now
samms
one
last
question
what
is
all
this
lens
stuff
really
about
what
are
all
you
lensmen
the
galactic
council
and
so
on
really
up
to
what
do
you
expect
to
get
out
of
it
and
why
would
anybody
want
to
make
such
an
effort
to
get
rid
of
you
and
give
it
to
me
on
the
lens
please
if
you
can
do
it
and
talk
at
the
same
time
that
was
a
wonderful
sensation
folks
of
getting
the
dope
straight
and
that
it
was
straight
i
can
and
will
answer
both
by
voice
and
by
lens
our
basic
purpose
is
and
he
quoted
verbatim
the
resounding
sentences
which
mentor
had
impressed
so
ineradicably
upon
his
mind
you
know
how
little
happiness
how
little
real
there
is
upon
any
world
today
we
propose
to
increase
both
what
we
expect
to
get
out
of
it
is
happiness
and
for
ourselves
the
satisfaction
felt
by
any
good
workman
doing
the
job
for
which
he
is
best
fitted
and
in
which
he
takes
pride
as
to
why
anyone
should
want
to
kill
me
the
logical
explanation
would
seem
to
be
that
some
group
or
organization
or
race
opposed
to
that
for
which
we
lensmen
stand
decided
to
do
away
with
us
and
started
with
me
thank
you
samms
i
am
sure
that
we
all
enjoyed
this
interview
very
much
now
folks
you
all
know
rod
the
rock
kinnison
just
a
little
closer
please
thank
you
i
suppose
you
have
any
suspicions
either
any
more
than
i
certainly
have
kinnison
barked
so
savagely
that
five
hundred
million
people
jumped
as
one
how
do
you
want
it
voice
or
lens
or
both
then
on
the
lens
think
it
over
son
because
suspect
please
mr
kinnison
even
universal
star
reporter
was
shaken
by
the
quiet
but
deadly
fury
of
the
big
lensman
thought
but
he
rallied
so
quickly
that
his
hesitation
was
barely
noticeable
your
lensed
thought
to
me
was
that
you
suspect
mr
kinnison
just
that
everybody
i
suspect
every
continental
government
of
every
world
we
know
including
that
of
north
america
of
tellus
i
suspect
political
parties
and
organized
minorities
i
suspect
pressure
groups
i
suspect
capital
and
i
suspect
labor
i
suspect
an
organization
of
criminals
i
suspect
nations
and
races
and
worlds
that
no
one
of
us
has
as
yet
heard
of
not
even
you
the
newshawk
of
the
universe
but
you
have
nothing
concrete
to
go
on
i
take
it
if
i
did
have
do
you
think
i
be
standing
here
talking
to
you
first
lensman
samms
sat
in
his
private
quarters
and
thought
lensman
dronvire
of

stood
behind
him
and
helped

with
all
his
force
and
drive

comprehensive
program
of
investigation
consolidation
expansion

and

virgilia
samms
went
to
a
party
practically
every
night
she
danced
she
flirted
she
talked
she
talked
meaningless
small
talk
for
the
most
part
but
interspersed
with
artless
questions
and
comments
which
while
they
perhaps
did
not
put
her
partner
of
the
moment
completely
at
ease
nevertheless
did
not
quite
excite
suspicion

completely
surrounded
by
breadboard
hookups
of

listened
and

and
finally
took

and
bearings
and

with
his

with
dozens
of

known

age
and
nels
bergenholm
abandoning
temporarily
his
regular
line
of
work
devoted
his
peculiar
talents
to
a
highly
abstruse
research
in
the
closely
allied
field
of
organic
chemistry
the
walls
of
virgil
samms
quarters
became
covered
with
charts
diagrams
and
figures
tabulations
and
condensations
piled
up
on
his
desk
and
overflowed
into
baskets
upon
the
floor
until
lensman
olmstead
of
alphacent
sir
his
secretary
announced
good
send
him
in
please
the
stranger
entered
the
two
men
after
staring
intently
at
each
other
for
half
a
minute
smiled
and
shook
hands
vigorously
except
for
the
fact
that
the
newcomer
hair
was
brown
they
were
practically
identical
i
certainly
glad
to
see
you
george
bergenholm
passed
you
of
course
yes
he
says
that
he
can
match
your
hair
to
mine
even
the
individual
white
ones
and
he
has
made
me
a
dream
of
a
wig
married
samms
mind
leaped
ahead
to
possible
complications
widower
same
as
you
and
just
a
minute
going
over
this
once
will
be
enough
he
lensed
call
after
call
lensmen
in
various
parts
of
space
became
en
rapport
with
him
and
thus
with
each
other
lensmen
especially
you
rod
george
olmstead
is
here
and
his
brother
ray
is
available
i
am
going
to
work
i
do
like
it
kinnison
protested
it
too
dangerous
i
told
the
universe
i
was
going
to
keep
you
covered
and
i
it
that
what
makes
it
perfectly
safe
that
is
if
bergenholm
is
that
the
duplication
is
close
enough
i
am
sure
bergenholm
deeply
resonant
left
no
doubt
at
all
in
any
one
of
the
linked
minds
the
substitution
will
not
be
detected
and
that
nobody
knows
george
or
even
suspects
that
you
got
your
lens
i
am
sure
of
that
olmstead
laughed
quietly
also
nobody
except
us
and
your
secretary
knows
that
i
am
here
for
a
good
many
years
i
have
made
a
specialty
of
that
sort
of
thing
photos
fingerprints
and
so
on
have
all
been
taken
care
of
good
i
simply
can
not
work
efficiently
here
samms
expressed
what
all
knew
to
be
the
simple
truth
dronvire
is
a
much
better
than
i
am
as
soon
as
any
significant
correlation
is
possible
he
will
know
it
we
have
learned
that
the
crowd
mackenzie
power
ossmen
industries
and
interstellar
spaceways
are
all
tied
in
together
and
that
thionite
is
involved
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
any
further
there
is
a
slight
correlation
barely
significant
between
deaths
from
thionite
and
the
arrival
in
the
solarian
system
of
certain
spaceways
liners
the
fact
that
certain
officials
of
the
service
have
been
and
are
spending
considerably
more
than
they
earn
sets
up
a
slight
but
definite
probability
that
they
are
allowing
or
boats
from
to
land
illegally
these
smugglers
carry
contraband
which
may
or
may
not
be
thionite
in
short
we
lack
fundamental
data
in
every
department
and
it
is
high
time
for
me
to
begin
doing
my
share
in
getting
it
i
do
check
you
virge
none
of
the
kinnisons
ever
did
give
up
without
a
struggle
olmstead
is
a
mighty
smooth
worker
and
you
are
our
prime
coordinator
why
not
let
him
keep
up
the
do
the
job
you
were
figuring
on
doing
yourself
and
you
stay
here
and
boss
it
i
have
thought
of
that
a
great
deal
and
have
because
olmstead
can
not
do
it
a
hitherto
silent
mind
cut
in
decisively
i
rularion
of
north
polar
jupiter
say
so
there
are
psychological
factors
involved
the
ability
to
separate
and
to
evaluate
the
constituent
elements
of
a
complex
situation
the
ability
to
make
correct
decisions
without
hesitation
as
well
as
many
others
not
as
susceptible
to
concise
statement
but
which
collectively
could
be
called
power
of
mind
how
say
you
bergenholm
of
tellus
for
i
have
perceived
in
you
a
mind
approximating
in
some
respects
the
philosophical
and
psychological
depth
of
my
own
this
outrageously
egotistical
declaration
was
to
the
jovian
a
simple
statement
of
an
equally
simple
truth
and
bergenholm
accepted
it
as
such
i
agree
olmstead
probably
could
not
succeed
well
then
can
samms
kinnison
demanded
who
knows
came
bergenholm
mental
shrug
and
simultaneously
nobody
knows
whether
i
can
or
not
but
i
am
going
to
try
and
samms
ended
almost
the
argument
by
asking
bergenholm
and
a
couple
of
other
lensmen
to
come
into
his
office
and
by
taking
off
his
lens
and
that
another
thing
i
do
like
kinnison
offered
one
last
objection
without
your
lens
can
happen
to
you
oh
i
wo
have
to
be
without
it
very
long
and
besides
virgilia
is
the
only
one
in
the
samms
family
who
can
work
better
sometimes
without
a
lens
the
lensmen
came
in
and
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
went
out
a
few
minutes
later
two
lensmen
strolled
out
of
samms
inner
office
into
the
outer
one
george
the
man
said
aloud
and
good
luck
same
to
you
chief
and
the
one
strode
out
norma
the
secretary
was
a
smart
girl
and
observant
in
her
position
she
had
to
be
her
eyes
followed
the
man
out
then
scanned
the
lensman
from
toe
to
crown
i
never
seen
anything
like
it
samms
she
remarked
then
except
for
the
difference
in
coloring
and
a
sort
of
well
stoopiness
he
could
be
your
identical
twin
you
two
must
have
had
a
common
ancestor
or
several
not
too
far
back
did
you
we
certainly
did
quadruple
second
cousins
you
might
call
it
we
have
known
of
each
other
for
years
but
this
is
the
first
time
we
have
met
quadruple
second
cousins
what
does
that
mean
how
come
well
say
that
once
upon
a
time
there
were
two
men
named
albert
and
chester
what
not
two
irishmen
named
pat
and
mike
you
slipping
boss
the
girl
smiled
roguishly
during
rush
hours
she
was
always
the
fast
cool
efficient
secretary
but
in
moments
of
ease
such
persiflage
as
this
was
the
usual
thing
in
the
first
lensman
private
office
not
at
all
up
to
your
usual
form
merely
because
i
am
speaking
now
as
a
genealogist
not
as
a
raconteur
but
to
continue
we
will
say
that
chester
and
albert
had
four
children
apiece
two
boys
and
two
girls
two
pairs
of
identical
twins
each
and
when
they
grew
up
half
way
up
that
is
do
tell
me
that
we
are
going
to
suppose
that
all
those
identical
twins
married
each
other
exactly
why
not
well
it
would
be
stretching
the
laws
of
probability
all
out
of
shape
but
go
ahead
i
can
see
what
coming
i
think
each
of
those
couples
had
one
and
only
one
child
we
will
call
those
children
jim
samms
and
sally
olmstead
john
olmstead
and
irene
samms
the
girl
levity
disappeared
james
alexander
samms
and
sarah
olmstead
samms
your
parents
i
did
see
what
was
coming
after
all
this
george
olmstead
then
is
your
whatever
it
is
yes
i
ca
name
it
either
maybe
you
had
better
call
genealogy
some
day
and
find
out
but
it
no
wonder
we
look
alike
and
there
are
three
of
us
not
two
george
has
an
identical
twin
brother
the
lensman
stepped
back
into
the
inner
office
shut
the
door
and
lensed
a
thought
at
virgil
samms
it
worked
virgil
i
talked
to
her
for
five
solid
minutes
practically
leaning
on
her
desk
and
she
did
tumble
and
if
this
wig
of
bergenholm
fooled
so
completely
the
job
he
did
on
you
would
fool
fine
i
done
a
little
testing
myself
on
the
keenest
men
i
know
without
a
trace
of
recognition
so
far
his
last
lingering
doubt
resolved
samms
boarded
the
ponderous
which
was
the
only
possible
means
of
entering
or
leaving
the
hill
a
fast
cruiser
whisked
him
to
nampa
where
olmstead
accidentally
damaged
transcontinental
transport
was
being
repaired
and
from
which
city
olmstead
had
been
gone
so
briefly
that
no
one
had
missed
him
he
occupied
space
he
surrendered
the
remainder
of
olmstead
ticket
he
reached
new
york
he
took
a
to
senator
morgan
office
he
was
escorted
into
the
private
office
of
herkimer
herkimer
third
olmstead
of
alphacent
yes
herkimer
hand
moved
ever
so
little
upon
his
desk
top
here
the
lensman
dropped
an
envelope
upon
the
desk
in
such
fashion
that
it
came
to
rest
within
an
inch
of
the
hand
prints
here
samms
made
prints
wash
your
hands
over
there
herkimer
pressed
a
button
check
all
these
prints
against
each
other
and
the
files
check
the
two
halves
of
the
torn
sheet
fiber
to
fiber
he
turned
to
the
lensless
lensman
now
standing
quietly
before
his
desk
routine
a
formality
in
your
case
but
necessary
of
course
then
for
long
seconds
the
two
hard
men
stared
into
the
hard
depths
of
each
other
eyes
you
may
do
olmstead
we
have
had
very
good
reports
of
you
but
you
have
never
been
in
thionite
no
i
have
never
even
seen
any
what
do
you
want
to
get
into
it
for
your
scouts
sounded
me
out
what
did
they
tell
you
the
usual
thing
promotion
from
the
ranks
into
the
brass
to
get
to
where
i
can
do
myself
and
the
organization
some
good
yourself
first
the
organization
second
what
else
why
should
i
be
different
from
the
rest
of
you
this
time
the
locked
eyes
held
longer
one
pair
smoldering
the
other
tawny
ice
why
indeed
herkimer
smiled
thinly
we
do
not
advertise
it
however
outside
i
would
either
but
here
i
laying
my
cards
flat
on
the
table
i
see
you
do
olmstead
if
you
live
there
a
test
you
know
they
told
me
there
would
be
well
are
you
curious
to
know
what
it
is
not
particularly
passed
it
did
you
what
do
you
mean
by
crack
herkimer
leaped
to
his
feet
his
eyes
smoldering
before
now
ablaze
exactly
what
i
said
no
more
and
no
less
you
may
read
into
it
anything
you
please
samms
voice
was
as
cold
as
were
his
eyes
you
picked
me
out
because
of
what
i
am
did
you
think
that
moving
upstairs
would
make
a
out
of
me
not
at
all
herkimer
sat
down
and
took
from
a
drawer
two
small
transparent
vaguely
tubes
each
containing
a
few
particles
of
purple
dust
you
know
what
this
is
i
can
guess
each
of
these
is
a
good
heavy
jolt
about
all
that
a
strong
man
with
a
strong
heart
can
stand
sit
down
here
is
one
dose
pull
the
cover
stick
the
capsule
up
one
nostril
squeeze
the
ejector
and
sniff
if
you
can
leave
this
other
dose
sitting
here
on
the
desk
you
will
live
and
thus
pass
the
test
if
you
ca
you
die
samms
sat
and
pulled
and
squeezed
and
sniffed
his
forearms
hit
the
desk
with
a
thud
his
hands
clenched
themselves
into
fists
the
tendons
standing
boldly
out
his
face
turned
white
his
eyes
jammed
themselves
shut
his
sprang
into
bands
and
lumps
as
they
clamped
his
teeth
hard
together
every
voluntary
muscle
in
his
body
went
into
a
rigor
as
extreme
as
that
of
death
itself
his
heart
pounded
his
breathing
became
stertorous
this
was
the
dreadful
so
uniquely
characteristic
of
thionite
the
frenzied
immobility
of
the
ultimately
passionate
satisfaction
of
every
desire
the
galactic
patrol
became
for
him
an
actuality
a
force
for
good
pervading
all
the
worlds
of
all
the
galaxies
of
all
the
universes
of
all
existing
continual
he
knew
what
the
lens
was
and
why
he
understood
time
and
space
he
knew
the
absolute
beginning
and
the
ultimate
end
he
also
saw
things
and
did
things
over
which
it
is
best
to
draw
a
kindly
veil
for
desire
mental
or
physical
open
or
sternly
suppressed
noble
or
base
that
virgil
samms
had
ever
had
was
being
every
desire
as
samms
sat
there
straining
motionlessly
upon
the
verge
of
death
through
sheer
ecstasy
a
door
opened
and
senator
morgan
entered
the
room
herkimer
started
almost
imperceptibly
as
he
turned
had
there
been
or
not
an
flash
of
guilt
in
those
now
completely
clear
and
frank
brown
eyes
hi
chief
come
in
and
sit
down
glad
to
see
you
this
is
not
exactly
my
idea
of
fun
no
when
did
you
stop
being
a
sadist
the
senator
sat
down
beside
his
minion
desk
the
fingertips
of
his
left
hand
began
soundlessly
to
drum
you
would
have
by
any
chance
been
considering
the
idea
of
he
paused
significantly
what
an
idea
herkimer
act
if
it
was
an
act
was
flawless
too
good
a
man
to
waste
i
know
it
but
you
did
act
as
though
you
did
i
never
seen
you
come
out
such
a
poor
second
in
an
interview
and
it
was
because
you
did
know
to
start
with
just
what
kind
of
a
tiger
he
was
why
he
was
selected
for
this
job
and
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
give
him
just
a
wee
bit
more
that
preposterous
chief
and
you
know
it
do
i
however
it
could
have
been
jealousy
because
he
is
being
considered
for
your
job
he
wo
be
over
you
and
there
plenty
of
room
for
everybody
what
was
the
matter
your
bloodthirstiness
have
taken
you
far
under
these
circumstances
come
clean
herkimer
okay
i
hate
the
whole
damned
family
herkimer
burst
out
viciously
i
see
that
adds
up
morgan
face
cleared
his
fingers
became
motionless
you
ca
make
the
samms
wench
and
are
in
position
to
skin
her
alive
so
you
get
allergic
to
all
her
relatives
that
adds
up
but
let
me
tell
you
something
his
quiet
level
voice
carried
more
of
menace
than
most
men
loudest
threats
keep
your
love
life
out
of
business
and
keep
that
sadistic
streak
under
control
do
let
anything
like
this
happen
again
i
wo
chief
i
got
off
the
beam
but
he
made
me
so
mad
certainly
that
exactly
what
he
was
trying
to
do
elementary
if
he
could
make
you
look
small
it
would
make
him
look
big
and
he
just
about
did
but
watch
now
he
coming
to
samms
muscles
relaxed
he
opened
his
eyes
groggily
then
as
a
wave
of
humiliated
realization
swept
over
his
consciousness
he
closed
them
again
and
shuddered
he
had
always
thought
himself
pretty
much
of
a
man
how
could
he
have
descended
to
such
nauseous
depths
of
depravity
of
turpitude
of
sheer
moral
degradation
and
yet
every
cell
of
his
being
was
shrieking
its
demand
for
more
his
mind
and
his
substance
alike
were
permeated
by
an
craving
to
experience
again
the
ultimate
thrills
which
they
had
so
tremendously
so
outrageously
enjoyed
there
was
another
good
jolt
lying
right
there
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
even
though
always
saw
to
it
that
no
more
of
the
drug
could
be
obtained
without
considerable
physical
exertion
which
exertion
would
bring
them
to
their
senses
if
he
took
that
jolt
it
would
kill
him
what
of
it
what
was
death
what
good
was
life
except
to
enjoy
such
thrills
as
he
had
just
had
and
was
about
to
have
again
and
besides
thionite
could
kill
he
was
a
he
had
just
proved
it
he
straightened
up
and
reached
for
the
capsule
and
that
effort
small
as
it
was
was
enough
to
bring
first
lensman
virgil
samms
back
under
control
the
craving
however
did
not
decrease
rather
it
increased
months
were
to
pass
before
he
could
think
of
thionite
or
even
of
the
color
purple
without
a
spasmodic
catching
of
the
breath
and
a
tightening
of
every
muscle
years
were
to
pass
before
he
could
forget
even
partially
the
theretofore
unsuspected
dwellers
in
the
dark
recesses
of
his
own
mind
nevertheless
from
the
store
of
whatever
it
was
that
made
him
what
he
was
virgil
samms
drew
strength
thumb
and
forefinger
touched
the
capsule
but
instead
of
picking
it
up
he
pushed
it
across
the
desk
toward
herkimer
put
it
away
bub
one
whiff
of
that
stuff
will
last
me
for
life
he
stared
unfathomably
at
the
secretary
then
turned
to
morgan
and
nodded
after
all
he
did
not
that
he
ever
passed
this
or
any
other
test
he
just
did
contradict
me
when
i
said
it
with
a
visible
effort
herkimer
remained
silent
but
morgan
did
not
you
talk
too
much
olmstead
can
you
stand
up
yet
gripping
the
desk
with
both
hands
samms
heaved
himself
to
his
feet
the
room
was
spinning
and
gyrating
every
individual
thing
in
it
was
moving
in
a
different
and
impossible
orbit
his
already
splintered
skull
threatened
more
and
more
violently
to
emulate
a
fragmentation
bomb
black
and
white
spots
and
flashes
filled
his
cone
of
vision
he
wrenched
one
hand
free
then
the
other
and
collapsed
back
into
the
chair
not
yet
quite
he
admitted
through
stiff
lips
although
he
was
careful
not
to
show
it
morgan
was
amazed
not
that
the
man
had
collapsed
but
that
he
had
been
able
so
soon
to
lift
himself
even
an
inch
tiger
was
not
the
word
this
olmstead
must
be
dinosaur
it
takes
a
few
minutes
longer
for
some
not
so
long
for
others
morgan
said
blandly
but
what
makes
you
think
herkimer
here
never
took
one
of
the
same
huh
again
two
pairs
of
eyes
locked
and
held
and
this
time
the
duel
was
longer
and
more
pregnant
what
do
think
how
do
you
suppose
i
lived
to
get
as
old
as
i
am
now
by
being
dumb
morgan
unwrapped
a
venerian
cigar
settled
it
comfortably
between
his
teeth
lit
it
and
drew
three
slow
puffs
before
replying
ah
a
student
an
analytical
mind
he
said
evenly
and
apparently
irrelevantly
let
skip
herkimer
for
the
moment
try
your
hand
on
me
why
not
from
what
we
hear
out
in
the
field
you
have
always
been
in
the
upper
brackets
so
you
probably
never
had
to
prove
that
you
could
take
it
or
let
it
alone
my
guess
would
be
though
that
you
could
the
good
old
oil
eh
morgan
allowed
his
face
and
voice
to
register
a
modicum
precisely
metered
of
contempt
how
to
get
along
in
the
world
lesson
one
butter
up
the
boss
nice
try
senator
but
i
have
to
score
you
a
clean
miss
samms
now
back
almost
to
normal
grinned
companionably
we
both
know
that
if
i
were
still
in
the
kindergarten
i
would
be
here
now
i
let
that
one
pass
this
time
under
that
look
and
tone
underlings
were
wont
to
cringe
but
this
olmstead
was
not
the
cringing
type
do
do
it
again
it
might
not
be
safe
oh
it
would
be
safe
enough
for
today
at
least
there
are
two
factors
which
you
are
very
carefully
ignoring
first
i
accepted
the
job
yet
are
you
innocent
enough
to
think
you
get
out
of
this
building
alive
if
i
do
accept
you
if
you
want
to
call
it
innocence
yes
oh
i
know
you
got
gunnies
all
over
the
place
but
they
do
mean
a
thing
no
morgan
voice
was
silkily
venomous
no
olmstead
was
completely
unimpressed
put
yourself
in
my
place
you
know
i
been
around
a
long
time
and
not
just
around
my
mother
i
was
weaned
quite
a
number
of
years
ago
i
see
you
do
scare
worth
a
damn
a
point
and
you
are
testing
me
just
as
i
am
testing
you
another
point
i
beginning
to
like
you
george
i
think
i
know
what
your
second
point
is
but
let
have
it
just
for
the
record
i
sure
you
do
any
man
to
be
my
boss
has
got
to
be
at
least
as
good
a
man
as
i
am
otherwise
i
take
his
job
away
from
him
fair
enough
by
god
i
like
you
olmstead
morgan
his
big
face
wreathed
in
smiles
got
up
strode
over
and
shook
hands
vigorously
and
samms
scan
as
he
would
could
not
even
hazard
a
guess
as
to
how
much
if
any
of
this
enthusiasm
was
real
do
you
want
the
job
and
when
can
you
go
to
work
yes
sir
two
hours
ago
sir
that
fine
morgan
boomed
although
he
did
not
comment
upon
it
he
noticed
and
understood
the
change
in
the
form
of
address
without
knowing
what
the
job
is
or
how
much
it
pays
neither
is
important
sir
at
the
moment
samms
who
had
got
up
easily
enough
to
shake
hands
now
shook
his
head
experimentally
nothing
rattled
good
he
was
in
pretty
good
shape
already
as
to
the
job
i
can
either
do
it
or
find
out
why
it
ca
be
done
as
to
pay
i
heard
you
called
a
lot
of
things
but
was
never
one
of
them
very
well
i
predict
that
you
will
go
far
morgan
again
shook
the
lensman
hand
and
again
samms
could
not
evaluate
the
sincerity
tuesday
afternoon
new
york
spaceport
report
to
captain
willoughby
in
the
dock
office
at
fourteen
hundred
hours
stop
at
the
cashier
office
on
your
way
out
chapter
piracy
was
rife
there
was
no
suspicion
however
nor
would
there
be
for
many
years
that
there
was
anything
of
very
large
purpose
about
the
business
murgatroyd
was
simply
a
captain
kidd
of
space
and
even
if
he
were
actually
connected
with
galactic
spaceways
that
fact
would
not
be
surprising
such
relationships
had
always
existed
the
most
ferocious
and
dreaded
pirates
of
the
ancient
world
worked
in
full
partnership
with
the
first
families
of
that
world
virgil
samms
was
thinking
of
pirates
and
of
piracy
when
he
left
senator
morgan
office
he
was
still
thinking
of
them
while
he
was
reporting
to
roderick
kinnison
hence
but
that
enough
about
this
stuff
and
me
rod
bring
me
up
to
date
on
operation
boskone
branching
out
no
end
your
guess
was
right
that
spaceways
losses
to
pirates
are
probably
phony
but
it
was
the
attacks
that
is
those
cases
in
which
the
ship
was
found
later
with
some
or
most
of
the
personnel
alive
that
gave
us
the
real
information
they
were
all
pretty
much
alike
but
when
we
studied
the
total
disappearances
we
really
hit
the
that
does
sound
just
right
but
i
listening
you
better
since
it
goes
farther
than
even
you
suspected
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
to
get
the
passenger
lists
and
the
names
of
the
crews
of
the
independent
ships
that
were
lost
without
a
trace
their
relatives
and
friends
we
concentrated
mostly
on
wives
could
be
located
except
for
the
usual
few
who
moved
around
so
much
that
they
got
lost
spacemen
average
young
you
know
and
their
wives
are
still
younger
well
these
young
women
got
jobs
most
of
them
remarried
and
so
on
in
short
normal
and
in
the
case
of
spaceways
not
normal
decidedly
not
in
the
first
place
you
be
amazed
at
how
little
publication
was
ever
done
of
passenger
lists
and
apparently
crew
lists
were
not
published
at
all
no
use
going
into
detail
as
to
how
we
got
the
stuff
but
we
got
it
however
nine
tenths
of
the
wives
had
disappeared
and
none
had
remarried
the
only
ones
we
could
find
were
those
who
did
not
care
even
when
their
husbands
were
alive
whether
they
ever
saw
them
again
or
not
but
the
big
break
was
you
remember
the
disappearance
of
that
cruise
ship
of
course
it
made
a
lot
of
noise
an
interesting
point
in
connection
with
that
cruise
is
that
two
days
before
the
ship
blasted
off
the
school
was
robbed
the
vault
was
opened
with
thermite
and
the
whole
administration
building
burned
to
the
ground
all
the
school
records
were
destroyed
thus
the
list
of
missing
had
to
be
made
up
from
statements
made
by
friends
relatives
and
what
not
i
remember
something
of
the
kind
my
impression
was
though
that
the
company
furnished
oh
the
tone
of
samms
thought
alerted
sharply
that
was
spaceways
under
cover
definitely
our
best
guess
is
that
there
were
quite
a
few
shiploads
of
women
disappeared
about
that
time
instead
of
one
austine
college
had
more
students
that
year
than
ever
before
or
since
it
was
the
extras
not
the
regulars
who
went
on
that
cruise
the
ones
who
figured
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
disappear
in
space
than
to
become
ordinary
missing
persons
but
rod
that
would
mean
but
where
it
means
just
that
and
finding
out
will
run
into
a
project
there
are
over
two
thousand
million
suns
in
this
galaxy
and
the
best
estimate
is
that
there
are
more
than
that
many
planets
habitable
by
beings
more
or
less
human
in
type
you
know
how
much
of
the
galaxy
has
been
explored
and
how
fast
the
work
of
exploring
the
rest
of
it
is
going
your
guess
is
just
as
good
as
mine
as
to
where
those
spacemen
and
engineers
and
their
wives
and
are
now
i
am
sure
though
of
four
things
none
of
which
we
can
ever
begin
to
prove
one
they
did
die
in
space
two
they
landed
on
a
comfortable
and
very
well
equipped
tellurian
planet
three
they
built
a
fleet
there
four
that
fleet
attacked
the
hill
murgatroyd
do
you
suppose
although
surprised
by
tremendous
report
samms
was
not
dismayed
no
idea
no
data
yet
and
they
keep
on
building
samms
said
they
had
a
fleet
much
larger
than
the
one
they
expected
to
meet
now
they
build
one
larger
than
all
our
combined
forces
and
since
the
politicians
will
always
know
what
we
are
doing
or
it
might
be
i
wonder
you
can
stop
wondering
kinnison
grinned
savagely
what
do
you
mean
just
what
you
were
going
to
think
about
you
know
the
edge
of
the
galaxy
closest
to
tellus
where
that
big
rift
cuts
in
yes
across
that
rift
where
it
wo
be
surveyed
for
a
thousand
years
there
a
planet
that
could
be
earth
twin
sister
no
atomic
energy
no
but
heavily
industrialized
and
anxious
to
welcome
us
project
bennett
very
nobody
except
lensmen
know
anything
about
it
two
friends
of
dronvire
smart
smooth
operators
are
in
charge
it
going
to
be
the
navy
yard
of
the
galactic
patrol
but
rod
samms
began
to
protest
his
mind
leaping
ahead
to
the
numberless
problems
the
tremendous
difficulties
inherent
in
the
program
which
his
friend
had
outlined
so
briefly
forget
it
virge
kinnison
cut
in
it
wo
be
easy
of
course
but
we
can
do
anything
they
can
do
and
do
it
better
you
can
go
calmly
ahead
with
your
own
chores
knowing
that
when
and
notice
that
i
say
not
we
need
it
we
have
a
fleet
up
our
sleeves
that
will
make
the
official
one
look
like
a
task
force
but
i
see
at
the
rendezvous
and
there
jill
tell
her
for
me
and
as
the
vegians
say
high
brother
samms
was
in
the
hotel
ornate
lobby
a
couple
of
uniformed
boys
and
jill
samms
were
approaching
the
girl
reached
him
first
you
had
no
trouble
in
recognizing
me
then
my
dear
none
at
all
uncle
george
she
kissed
him
perfunctorily
the
bell
hops
faded
away
so
nice
to
see
you
i
heard
much
about
you
the
marine
room
you
said
yes
i
reserved
a
table
and
in
that
famous
restaurant
in
the
unequalled
privacy
of
the
noisiest
and
most
crowded
night
spot
they
drank
sparingly
ate
and
talked
not
sparingly
at
all
it
perfectly
safe
here
you
think
jill
asked
first
perfectly
a
microphone
could
hear
anything
and
it
so
dark
that
a
even
if
he
could
read
us
would
need
a
pair
of
goody
they
did
a
marvelous
job
dad
if
it
were
for
your
well
your
personality
i
would
recognize
you
even
now
you
think
i
safe
then
absolutely
then
we
get
down
to
business
you
knobos
and
dalnalten
all
have
keen
and
powerful
minds
you
ca
all
be
wrong
spaceways
then
is
tied
in
with
both
the
gang
and
with
thionite
the
logical
extension
of
that
dal
certainly
thought
of
it
even
though
he
mention
it
would
be
samms
paused
check
that
the
notorious
murgatroyd
instead
of
being
just
another
pirate
chief
is
really
working
for
spaceways
and
belongs
to
the
gang
but
dad
what
an
idea
can
things
be
rotten
really
they
may
be
worse
than
that
now
the
next
thing
who
in
your
opinion
is
the
real
boss
well
it
certainly
is
not
herkimer
herkimer
third
jill
ticked
him
off
on
a
pink
forefinger
she
had
been
asked
for
an
opinion
she
set
out
to
give
it
without
apology
or
hesitation
he
could
just
about
direct
the
affairs
of
a
stand
nor
is
it
clander
he
is
even
a
little
fish
he
scarcely
a
minnow
equally
certainly
it
is
neither
the
venerian
nor
the
martian
they
may
run
planetary
affairs
but
nothing
bigger
i
have
met
murgatroyd
of
course
but
i
have
had
several
evaluations
and
he
does
not
rate
up
with
towne
and
big
jim
and
this
surprised
me
as
much
as
it
will
you
is
almost
certainly
not
the
prime
mover
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
that
would
have
surprised
me
tremendously
yesterday
but
after
today
i
tell
you
about
that
presently
it
does
i
glad
of
that
i
expected
an
argument
and
i
have
been
inclined
to
question
the
validity
of
my
own
results
since
they
do
not
agree
with
common
knowledge
or
rather
what
is
supposed
to
be
knowledge
that
leaves
isaacson
and
senator
morgan
jill
frowned
in
perplexity
seemed
for
the
first
time
unsure
isaacson
is
of
course
a
big
man
able
extremely
capable
a
executive
not
only
would
to
be
to
run
spaceways
on
the
other
hand
i
have
always
thought
that
morgan
was
nothing
but
a
windbag
jill
stopped
talking
left
the
thought
hanging
in
air
so
did
i
until
today
samms
agreed
grimly
i
thought
that
he
was
simply
an
unusually
corrupt
greedy
politician
our
estimates
of
him
may
have
to
be
changed
very
radically
samms
mind
raced
from
two
entirely
different
angles
of
approach
jill
and
he
had
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
but
if
morgan
were
really
the
big
shot
would
he
have
deigned
to
interview
personally
such
small
fry
as
olmstead
or
was
olmstead
job
of
more
importance
than
he
samms
had
supposed
i
got
a
dozen
more
things
to
check
with
you
he
went
on
almost
without
a
pause
but
since
this
leadership
matter
is
the
only
one
in
which
my
experience
would
affect
your
judgment
i
had
better
tell
you
about
what
happened
today
tuesday
came
and
hour
fourteen
hundred
and
samms
strode
into
an
office
there
was
a
big
clean
desk
a
wiry
intense
man
captain
willoughby
yes
george
olmstead
reporting
fourth
officer
the
captain
punched
a
button
the
heavy
door
closed
itself
and
locked
officer
new
rank
eh
what
does
the
ticket
cover
new
and
special
here
the
articles
read
it
and
sign
it
he
did
not
add
or
else
it
was
not
necessary
it
was
clearly
evident
that
captain
willoughby
never
garrulous
intended
to
be
particularly
reticent
with
his
new
subordinate
samms
read
fourth
officer
shall
no
duties
or
responsibilities
in
the
operation
or
maintenance
of
said
cargo
then
came
a
clause
which
fairly
leaped
from
the
paper
and
smote
his
eyes
when
in
command
of
a
detail
outside
the
hull
of
said
he
shall
enforce
by
the
infliction
of
death
or
such
other
penalty
as
he
deems
fit
the
lensman
was
rocked
to
the
heels
but
did
not
show
it
instead
he
took
the
captain
pen
his
own
as
far
as
willoughby
was
concerned
could
have
been
filled
with
vanishing
ink
and
wrote
george
name
in
george
olmstead
bold
flowing
script
willoughby
then
took
him
aboard
the
good
ship
and
led
him
to
his
cabin
here
you
are
olmstead
beyond
getting
acquainted
with
the
and
the
rest
of
your
men
you
will
have
no
duties
for
a
few
days
you
have
full
run
of
the
ship
with
one
exception
stay
out
of
the
control
room
until
i
call
you
is
that
clear
yes
sir
willoughby
turned
away
and
samms
after
tossing
his
into
the
rack
took
inventory
the
room
was
of
course
very
small
but
considering
the
importance
of
mass
it
was
almost
extravagantly
supplied
there
were
shelves
or
rather
tight
racks
of
books
there
were
and
and
exercisers
and
games
there
was
a
receiver
capable
of
bringing
in
programs
from
almost
anywhere
in
space
the
room
had
only
one
lack
it
did
not
have
an
visiplate
nor
was
this
lack
surprising
they
would
scarcely
let
george
olmstead
know
where
they
were
taking
him
samms
was
surprised
however
when
he
met
the
men
who
were
to
be
directly
under
his
command
for
instead
of
one
or
at
most
two
they
numbered
exactly
forty
and
they
were
all
he
thought
at
first
glance
the
dregs
and
sweepings
of
the
lowest
dives
in
space
before
long
however
he
learned
that
they
were
not
all
and
denizens
of
skid
rows
six
of
them
the
strongest
physically
and
the
hardest
mentally
of
the
lot
were
fugitives
from
lethal
chambers
murderers
and
worse
he
looked
at
the
biggest
toughest
one
of
the
six
a
giant
and
asked
what
did
they
tell
you
tworn
that
your
job
was
going
to
be
they
did
say
just
that
it
was
dangerous
but
if
i
done
exactly
what
my
boss
would
tell
me
to
do
and
nothing
else
i
might
not
even
get
hurt
an
i
was
due
to
take
the
deep
breath
the
next
week
see
that
just
how
it
was
boss
i
see
and
one
by
one
virgil
samms
master
psychologist
studied
and
analyzed
his
motley
crew
until
he
was
called
into
the
control
room
the
navigating
tank
was
covered
no
charts
were
to
be
seen
the
one
live
visiplate
showed
a
planet
and
a
fiercely
sun
my
orders
are
to
tell
you
at
this
point
all
i
know
about
what
got
to
do
and
about
that
planet
down
there
trenco
they
call
it
to
virgil
samms
the
first
adherent
of
civilization
ever
to
hear
it
that
name
meant
nothing
whatever
you
are
to
take
about
five
of
your
men
go
down
there
and
gather
all
the
green
leaves
you
can
not
green
in
color
sort
of
purplish
what
they
call
broadleaf
is
the
best
leaves
about
two
feet
long
and
a
foot
wide
but
do
be
too
choosy
if
there
is
any
broadleaf
handy
grab
anything
you
can
get
hold
of
what
is
the
opposition
samms
asked
quietly
and
what
have
they
got
that
makes
them
so
tough
nothing
no
inhabitants
even
just
the
planet
itself
next
to
arisia
it
the
god
damndest
planet
in
space
i
never
been
any
closer
to
it
than
this
and
i
never
will
so
i
do
know
anything
about
it
except
what
i
hear
but
there
something
about
it
that
kills
men
or
drives
them
crazy
we
spend
seven
or
eight
boats
every
trip
and
or
forty
men
and
the
biggest
load
that
anybody
ever
took
away
from
here
was
just
under
two
hundred
pounds
of
leaf
a
good
many
times
we
do
get
any
they
go
crazy
eh
in
spite
of
his
control
samms
paled
but
it
could
be
like
arisia
what
are
the
symptoms
what
do
they
say
various
main
thing
seems
to
be
that
they
lose
their
sight
do
go
blind
exactly
but
ca
see
where
anything
is
or
if
they
do
see
it
it
is
there
and
it
rains
over
forty
feet
deep
every
night
and
yet
it
all
dries
up
by
morning
the
worst
electrical
storms
in
the
universe
and
i
can
show
you
charts
on
that
of
over
eight
hundred
miles
an
hour
whew
how
about
time
with
your
permission
i
would
like
to
do
some
surveying
before
i
try
to
land
a
smart
idea
a
couple
of
the
other
boys
had
the
same
but
it
help
they
did
come
back
i
give
you
two
tellurian
days
no
three
before
i
give
you
up
and
start
sending
out
the
other
boats
pick
out
your
five
men
and
see
what
you
can
do
as
the
boat
dropped
away
willoughby
voice
came
briskly
from
a
speaker
i
know
that
you
five
men
have
got
ideas
forget
fourth
officer
olmstead
has
the
authority
and
the
orders
to
put
a
slug
through
the
guts
of
any
or
all
of
you
that
do
jump
and
jump
fast
to
do
what
he
tells
you
and
if
that
boat
makes
any
funny
moves
i
blast
it
out
of
the
ether
good
harvesting
for
tellurian
hours
taking
time
out
only
to
sleep
samms
scanned
and
surveyed
the
planet
trenco
and
the
more
he
studied
it
the
more
outrageously
abnormal
it
became
trenco
was
and
is
a
peculiar
planet
indeed
its
atmosphere
is
not
air
as
we
know
air
its
hydrosphere
does
not
resemble
water
half
of
that
atmosphere
and
most
of
that
hydrosphere
are
one
chemical
a
substance
of
very
low
heat
of
vaporization
and
having
a
boiling
point
of
about
degrees
fahrenheit
trenco
days
are
intensely
hot
its
nights
are
bitterly
cold
at
night
therefore
it
rains
and
by
comparison
a
tellurian
downpour
of
one
inch
per
hour
is
scarcely
a
drizzle
upon
trenco
it
really
forty
seven
feet
and
five
inches
of
precipitation
every
night
of
every
trenconian
year
and
this
tremendous
condensation
of
course
causes
wind
willoughby
graphs
were
accurate
except
at
very
poles
there
is
not
a
spot
in
which
or
a
time
at
which
an
earthly
gale
would
not
constitute
a
dead
calm
and
along
the
equator
at
every
sunrise
and
every
sunset
the
wind
blows
from
the
day
side
into
the
night
side
at
a
velocity
which
no
tellurian
hurricane
or
cyclone
however
violent
has
even
distantly
approached
also
therefore
there
is
lightning
not
in
the
mild
and
occasional
flashes
which
we
of
gentle
terra
know
but
in
a
continuous
blinding
glare
which
outshines
a
normal
sun
in
battering
shattering
discharges
which
not
only
make
darkness
unknown
there
but
also
distort
beyond
recognition
and
beyond
function
the
warp
and
the
woof
of
space
itself
sight
is
almost
completely
useless
in
that
fantastically
altered
medium
so
is
the
landing
on
the
daylight
side
except
possibly
at
exact
noon
would
be
impossible
because
of
the
wind
nor
could
the
ship
stay
landed
for
more
than
a
couple
of
minutes
landing
on
the
night
side
would
be
practically
as
bad
because
of
the
terrific
charge
the
boat
would
pick
up
unless
the
boat
carried
something
that
could
be
rebuilt
into
a
leaker
did
it
it
did
time
after
time
from
pole
to
pole
and
from
midnight
around
the
clock
samms
stabbed
visibeam
and
down
toward
trenco
surface
with
consistently
and
meaninglessly
impossible
results
the
planet
tipped
lurched
spun
and
danced
it
broke
up
into
chunks
each
of
which
began
insanely
to
follow
mathematically
impossible
paths
finally
in
desperation
he
rammed
a
beam
down
and
held
it
down
again
he
saw
the
planet
break
up
before
his
eyes
but
this
time
he
held
on
he
that
he
was
well
out
of
the
stratosphere
a
good
two
hundred
miles
up
nevertheless
he
a
tremendous
mass
of
jagged
rock
falling
straight
down
with
terrific
velocity
upon
his
tiny
lifeboat
unfortunately
the
crew
to
whom
he
had
not
been
paying
overmuch
attention
of
late
saw
it
too
and
one
of
them
with
a
bestial
yell
leaped
toward
samms
and
the
controls
samms
reaching
for
pistol
and
blackjack
whirled
around
just
in
time
to
see
the
big
lay
the
attacker
out
cold
with
a
vicious
chop
at
the
base
of
the
skull
thanks
tworn
why
because
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
alive
and
had
us
all
in
hell
in
fifteen
minutes
you
know
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
we
do
so
i
playin
it
your
way
see
i
see
can
you
use
a
sap
an
artist
the
big
man
admitted
modestly
just
tell
me
how
long
you
want
a
guy
to
be
out
and
i
wo
miss
it
a
minute
either
way
but
you
better
blow
that
crumb
brains
out
right
now
he
ai
no
damn
good
not
until
after
i
see
whether
he
can
work
or
not
you
a
procian
are
you
yeah
midlands
north
central
what
did
you
do
nothing
much
at
first
just
killed
a
guy
that
needed
killing
but
the
goddam
louse
had
a
lot
of
money
so
they
give
me
twenty
five
years
i
did
like
it
very
well
and
acted
rough
so
they
give
me
solitary
boot
bandage
and
so
on
so
i
tried
a
break
killed
six
or
eight
maybe
a
dozen
guards
but
did
quite
make
it
so
they
slated
me
for
the
big
whiff
that
all
boss
i
promoting
you
now
to
squad
leader
here
the
sap
he
handed
tworn
his
blackjack
watch
i
be
too
busy
to
this
landing
is
going
to
be
tough
gotcha
boss
tworn
was
calibrating
his
weapon
by
slugging
himself
experimentally
on
the
leg
go
ahead
as
far
as
these
crumbs
are
concerned
you
got
this
all
to
yourself
samms
had
finally
decided
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
located
the
terminator
on
the
morning
side
poised
his
little
ship
somewhat
nearer
to
dawn
than
to
midnight
and
cut
the
rope
he
took
one
quick
reading
on
the
sun
cut
off
his
plates
and
let
her
drop
watching
only
his
pressure
gages
and
gyros
one
hundred
millimeters
of
mercury
three
hundred
five
hundred
he
slowed
her
down
he
was
going
to
hit
a
thin
liquid
but
if
he
hit
it
too
hard
he
would
smash
the
boat
and
he
had
no
idea
what
the
atmospheric
pressure
at
trenco
surface
would
be
six
hundred
even
this
late
at
night
it
might
be
greater
than
earth
and
it
might
be
a
lot
less
seven
hundred
slower
and
slower
he
crept
downward
his
tension
mounting
infinitely
faster
than
did
the
needle
of
the
gage
this
was
an
instrument
landing
with
a
vengeance
eight
hundred
how
was
the
crew
taking
it
how
many
of
them
had
tworn
had
to
disable
he
glanced
quickly
around
none
now
that
they
could
not
see
the
hallucinatory
images
upon
the
plates
they
were
not
suffering
at
all
he
himself
was
the
only
one
aboard
who
was
feeling
the
strain
nine
hundred
nine
hundred
forty
the
boat
hit
the
drink
with
a
crashing
splashing
impact
its
pace
was
slow
enough
however
and
the
liquid
was
deep
enough
so
that
no
damage
was
done
samms
applied
a
little
driving
power
and
swung
his
craft
sharp
nose
into
the
line
toward
the
sun
the
little
ship
plowed
slowly
forward
as
nearly
just
awash
as
samms
could
keep
her
grounded
as
gently
as
a
river
upon
a
the
starkly
incredible
downpour
slackened
the
lensman
knew
that
the
second
critical
moment
was
at
hand
strap
down
men
until
we
see
what
this
wind
is
going
to
do
to
us
the
atmosphere
moving
at
a
velocity
well
above
that
of
sound
was
in
effect
not
a
gas
but
a
solid
even
a
spaceboat
hard
skin
of
alloy
plate
with
all
its
bracing
could
not
take
what
was
coming
next
inert
she
would
be
split
open
smashed
flattened
out
and
twisted
into
pretzels
samms
finger
stabbed
down
the
berg
went
into
action
the
lifeboat
went
free
just
as
that
raging
blast
of
vapor
wrenched
her
into
the
air
the
second
descent
was
much
faster
and
much
easier
than
the
first
nor
this
time
did
samms
remain
surfaced
or
drive
toward
shore
knowing
now
that
this
ocean
was
not
deep
enough
to
harm
his
vessel
he
let
her
sink
to
the
bottom
more
he
turned
her
on
her
side
and
drove
her
at
a
flat
angle
into
the
bottom
so
deep
that
the
rim
of
her
starboard
lock
was
flush
with
the
ocean
floor
again
they
waited
and
this
time
the
wind
did
not
blow
the
lifeboat
away
upon
purely
theoretical
grounds
samms
had
reasoned
that
the
weird
distortion
of
vision
must
be
a
function
of
distance
and
his
observations
so
far
had
been
in
accord
with
that
hypothesis
now
slowly
and
cautiously
he
sent
out
a
visibeam
ten
feet
twenty
forty
all
clear
at
fifty
the
seeing
was
definitely
bad
at
sixty
it
became
impossible
he
shortened
back
to
forty
and
began
to
study
the
vegetation
growing
with
such
fantastic
speed
that
the
leaves
pressed
flat
to
the
ground
by
the
gale
and
anchored
there
by
heavy
rootlets
were
already
inches
long
there
was
also
what
seemed
to
be
animal
life
of
sorts
but
samms
was
not
at
the
moment
interested
in
trenconian
zoology
are
them
the
plants
we
going
to
get
boss
tworn
asked
staring
into
the
plate
over
samms
shoulder
shall
we
go
out
now
an
start
pickin
not
yet
even
if
we
could
open
the
port
the
blast
would
wreck
us
also
it
would
shear
your
head
off
flush
with
the
coaming
as
fast
as
you
stuck
it
out
this
wind
should
ease
off
after
a
while
we
go
out
a
little
before
noon
in
the
meantime
we
get
ready
have
the
boys
break
out
a
couple
of
spare
number
twelve
struts
some
clamps
and
chain
four
snatch
blocks
and
a
hundred
feet
of
heavy
good
he
went
on
when
the
order
had
been
obeyed
rig
the
line
from
the
winch
through
snatch
blocks
here
and
here
and
here
so
i
can
haul
you
back
against
the
wind
while
you
are
doing
that
i
rig
a
remote
control
on
the
winch
shortly
before
trenco
fierce
sun
reached
meridian
the
six
men
donned
and
samms
cautiously
opened
the
ports
they
worked
the
wind
was
now
scarcely
more
than
an
earthly
hurricane
the
wildly
whipping
broadleaf
plants
struggling
upward
were
almost
to
the
vertical
the
leaves
were
apparently
almost
fully
grown
four
men
clamped
their
suits
to
the
line
the
line
was
paid
out
each
man
selected
two
leaves
the
largest
fattest
purplest
ones
he
could
reach
samms
hauled
them
back
and
received
the
loot
tworn
stowed
the
leaves
away
again
again
again
with
noon
there
came
a
few
minutes
of
calm
a
strong
man
could
stand
against
the
now
highly
variable
wind
could
move
around
without
being
blown
beyond
the
horizon
and
during
those
few
minutes
all
six
men
gathered
leaves
that
time
however
was
very
short
the
wind
steadied
into
the
reverse
direction
with
fury
winch
and
again
came
into
play
and
in
a
scant
half
hour
when
the
line
began
to
hum
an
almost
musical
note
under
its
load
samms
decided
to
call
it
quits
that
be
all
for
today
boys
he
announced
about
twice
more
and
this
line
will
part
you
done
too
good
a
job
to
lose
you
secure
ship
shall
i
blow
the
air
sir
tworn
asked
i
do
think
so
samms
thought
for
a
moment
no
i
afraid
to
take
the
chance
this
stuff
whatever
it
is
is
probably
as
poisonous
as
cyanide
we
keep
our
suits
on
and
exhaust
into
space
time
passed
night
came
the
rain
and
the
flood
the
bottom
softened
samms
blasted
the
lifeboat
out
of
the
mud
and
away
from
the
planet
he
opened
the
bleeder
valves
then
both
ports
the
contaminated
air
was
replaced
by
the
vacuum
of
the
void
he
signaled
the
the
lifeboat
was
taken
aboard
quick
trip
olmstead
willoughby
congratulated
him
i
surprised
that
you
got
back
at
all
to
say
nothing
of
with
so
much
stuff
and
not
losing
a
man
give
me
the
weight
mister
fast
three
hundred
and
forty
eight
pounds
sir
the
reported
my
god
and
all
pure
broadleaf
ever
did
before
how
did
you
do
it
olmstead
i
do
know
whether
that
would
be
any
of
your
business
or
not
samms
mien
was
not
insulting
merely
thoughtful
not
that
i
give
a
damn
but
my
way
might
not
help
anybody
else
much
and
i
think
i
had
better
report
to
the
main
office
first
and
let
them
do
the
telling
fair
enough
fair
enough
the
skipper
conceded
ungrudgingly
what
a
load
and
no
losses
one
boatload
of
air
is
all
but
air
is
expensive
out
here
samms
made
a
point
deliberately
air
willoughby
snorted
i
swap
you
a
hundred
flasks
of
air
any
time
for
any
one
of
those
leaves
which
was
what
samms
wanted
to
know
captain
willoughby
was
smart
he
knew
that
the
way
to
succeed
was
to
use
and
then
to
trample
upon
his
inferiors
to
toady
to
such
superiors
as
were
too
strong
to
be
pulled
down
and
thus
supplanted
he
knew
this
olmstead
had
what
it
took
to
be
a
big
shot
therefore
they
told
me
to
keep
you
in
the
dark
until
we
got
to
trenco
he
more
than
half
apologized
to
his
fourth
officer
shortly
after
the
blasted
away
from
the
trenconian
system
but
they
did
say
anything
about
afterwards
maybe
they
figured
you
would
be
aboard
any
more
as
usual
but
anyway
you
can
stay
right
here
in
the
control
room
if
you
want
to
thanks
skipper
but
might
it
be
just
as
well
he
jerked
his
head
inconspicuously
toward
the
other
officers
to
play
the
string
out
this
trip
i
do
care
where
we
going
and
we
do
want
anybody
to
get
any
funny
ideas
that
be
a
lot
better
of
course
as
long
as
you
know
that
your
cards
are
all
aces
as
far
as
i
concerned
thanks
willoughby
i
remember
that
samms
had
not
been
entirely
frank
with
the
private
captain
from
the
time
required
to
make
the
trip
he
knew
to
within
a
few
parsecs
trenco
distance
from
sol
he
did
not
know
the
direction
since
the
distance
was
so
great
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
recognize
any
star
or
constellation
he
did
know
however
the
course
upon
which
the
vessel
then
was
and
he
would
know
courses
and
distances
from
then
on
he
was
well
content
a
couple
of
uneventful
days
passed
samms
was
again
called
into
the
control
room
to
see
that
the
ship
was
approaching
a
solar
system
this
where
we
going
to
land
he
asked
indifferently
we
ai
going
to
land
willoughby
told
him
you
are
going
to
take
the
broadleaf
down
in
your
boat
close
enough
so
that
you
can
parachute
it
down
to
where
it
has
to
go
way
pilot
go
inert
and
match
intrinsics
now
olmstead
watch
you
seen
systems
like
this
before
no
but
i
know
about
them
those
two
suns
over
there
are
a
hell
of
a
lot
bigger
and
further
away
than
they
look
and
this
one
here
much
smaller
is
in
the
trojan
position
have
those
big
suns
got
any
planets
five
or
six
apiece
they
say
all
hotter
and
dryer
than
the
brazen
hinges
of
hell
this
sun
here
has
seven
but
number
two
they
call
it
is
the
only
tellurian
planet
in
the
system
the
first
thing
we
look
for
is
a
big
continent
there
only
one
of
that
shape
there
it
is
over
there
notice
that
one
end
is
bigger
than
the
other
that
end
is
north
strike
a
line
to
split
the
continent
in
two
and
measure
from
the
north
end
of
the
length
of
the
line
that
the
point
we
diving
at
now
see
that
crater
yes
the
although
still
hundreds
of
miles
up
was
slowing
rapidly
it
must
be
a
big
one
it
a
good
fifty
miles
across
go
down
until
you
dead
sure
that
the
box
will
land
somewhere
inside
the
rim
of
that
crater
then
dump
it
the
parachute
and
the
sender
are
automatic
understand
yes
sir
i
understand
and
samms
took
off
he
was
vastly
more
interested
in
the
stars
however
than
in
delivering
the
broadleaf
the
constellation
directly
beyond
sol
from
wherever
he
was
might
be
recognizable
its
shape
would
be
smaller
and
more
or
less
distorted
its
smaller
stars
brilliant
to
earthly
eyes
only
because
of
their
nearness
would
be
dimmer
perhaps
invisible
the
picture
would
be
further
confused
by
intervening
nearby
brilliant
strangers
but
such
giants
as
canopus
and
rigel
and
betelgeuse
and
deneb
would
certainly
be
highly
visible
if
he
could
only
recognize
them
from
trenco
his
search
had
failed
but
he
was
still
trying
was
something
vaguely
familiar
sweating
with
the
mental
effort
he
blocked
out
the
stars
and
studied
intensively
those
that
were
left
a
and
a
red
were
most
prominent
rigel
and
betelgeuse
could
that
constellation
be
orion
the
belt
was
very
faint
but
it
was
there
then
sirius
ought
to
be
about
there
and
pollux
about
there
and
at
this
distance
about
equally
bright
they
were
aldebaran
would
be
orange
and
about
one
magnitude
brighter
than
pollux
and
capella
would
be
yellow
and
half
a
magnitude
brighter
still
there
they
were
not
too
close
to
where
they
should
be
but
close
enough
it
was
orion
and
this
thionite
then
was
somewhere
near
right
ascension
seventeen
hours
and
declination
plus
ten
degrees
he
returned
to
the
she
blasted
off
samms
asked
very
few
questions
and
willoughby
volunteered
very
little
information
nevertheless
the
first
lensman
learned
more
than
anyone
of
his
fellow
pirates
would
have
believed
possible
aloof
taciturn
disinterested
to
a
degree
he
seemed
to
spend
practically
all
of
his
time
in
his
cabin
when
he
was
not
actually
at
work
but
he
kept
his
eyes
and
his
ears
wide
open
and
virgil
samms
as
has
been
intimated
had
a
brain
the
made
a
quick
flit
from
cavenda
to
vegia
arriving
exactly
on
time
a
proud
clean
as
high
above
suspicion
as
calpurnia
herself
samms
unloaded
her
cargo
replaced
it
with
one
for
earth
she
was
serviced
she
made
a
fast
eventless
run
to
tellus
she
docked
at
new
york
spaceport
virgil
samms
walked
unconcernedly
into
an
george
olmstead
fully
informed
walked
unconcernedly
out
as
soon
as
he
could
samms
lensed
northrop
and
jack
kinnison
we
lined
up
a
thousand
and
one
signals
sir
northrop
reported
for
the
pair
but
only
one
of
them
carried
a
message
and
it
did
make
sense
why
not
samms
asked
sharply
with
a
lens
kind
of
a
message
however
garbled
coded
or
interrupted
makes
sense
oh
we
understood
what
it
said
jack
came
in
but
it
did
say
enough
just
ready
ready
over
and
over
what
samms
exclaimed
and
the
boys
could
feel
his
mind
work
did
that
signal
by
any
chance
originate
anywhere
near
seventeen
hours
and
plus
ten
degrees
very
near
why
how
did
you
know
then
it
does
make
sense
samms
exclaimed
and
called
a
general
conference
of
lensmen
keep
working
along
these
same
lines
samms
directed
finally
keep

i
am

roderick
kinnison
of

protested
but
equally
of
course
his
protests
were
chapter
pluto
is
on
the
average
about
forty
times
as
far
away
from
the
sun
as
is
mother
earth
each
square
yard
of
earth
surface
receives
about
sixteen
hundred
times
as
much
heat
as
does
each
of
pluto
the
sun
as
seen
from
pluto
is
a
dim
wan
speck
even
at
perihelion
an
event
which
occurs
only
once
in
two
hundred
forty
eight
tellurian
years
and
at
noon
and
on
the
equator
pluto
is
so
bitterly
cold
that
climatic
conditions
upon
its
surface
simply
can
not
be
described
by
or
to
man
as
good
an
indication
as
any
can
be
given
perhaps
by
mentioning
the
fact
that
it
had
taken
the
patrol
best
engineers
over
six
months
to
perfect
the
armor
which
virgil
samms
then
wore
for
no
ordinary
would
do
space
itself
is
not

the
only
loss
of
heat
is
by
radiation
into
or
through
an
almost
perfect
vacuum
in
contact
with
pluto
rocky
metallic
soil
however
there
would
be
conduction
and
the
magnitude
of
the
inevitable
made
the
tellurian

gasp

insistent

remember
those
psychologists
if
they
stayed
in

with

for
five

they
froze
their

to

ankles
not
that
the

sometimes
slip

more
ways
than

if

here
at

virgil
samms
landed
his
feet
stayed
warm
finally
assured
that
the
heaters
of
his
suit
could
carry
the
load
indefinitely
he
made
his
way
on
foot
into
the
settlement
near
which
he
had
come
to
ground
and
there
he
saw
his
first
palainian
or
strictly
speaking
he
saw
part
of
his
first
palainian
for
no
creature
has
ever
seen
or
ever
will
see
in
entirety
any
member
of
any
of
the
races
since
life
as
we
know
it
organic
life
is
based
upon
liquid
water
and
gaseous
oxygen
such
life
did
not
and
could
not
develop
upon
planets
whose
temperatures
are
only
a
few
degrees
above
absolute
zero
many
perhaps
most
of
these
planets
have
an
atmosphere
of
sorts
some
have
no
atmosphere
at
all
nevertheless
with
or
without
atmosphere
and
completely
without
oxygen
and
water
life
highly
intelligent
life
did
develop
upon
millions
and
millions
of
such
worlds
that
life
is
not
however
strictly
of
necessity
even
in
the
lowest
forms
it
possesses
an
extension
into
the
and
it
is
this
metabolic
extension
alone
which
makes
it
possible
for
life
to
exist
under
such
extreme
conditions
the
extension
makes
it
impossible
for
any
human
being
to
see
anything
of
a
palainian
except
the
fluid
amorphous
thing
which
is
his
aspect
of
the
moment
makes
any
attempt
at
description
or
portraiture
completely
futile
virgil
samms
stared
at
the
palainian
tried
to
see
what
it
looked
like
he
could
not
tell
whether
it
had
eyes
or
antennae
legs
arms
or
tentacles
teeth
or
beaks
talons
or
claws
or
feet
skin
scales
or
feathers
it
did
not
even
remotely
resemble
anything
that
the
lensman
had
ever
seen
sensed
or
imagined
he
gave
up
sent
out
an
exploring
thought
i
am
virgil
samms
a
tellurian
he
sent
out
slowly
carefully
after
he
made
contact
with
the
outer
fringes
of
the
creature
mind
is
it
possible
for
you
sir
or
madam
to
give
me
a
moment
of
your
time
eminently
possible
lensman
samms
since
my
time
is
of
completely
negligible
value
the
monster
mind
flashed
into
accord
with
with
a
speed
and
precision
that
made
him
gasp
that
is
a
part
of
it
became
en
rapport
with
a
part
of
his
years
were
to
pass
before
even
the
first
lensman
would
know
much
more
about
the
palainian
than
he
learned
in
that
first
contact
no
human
beings
except
the
children
of
the
lens
ever
were
to
understand
even
dimly
the
labyrinthine
intricacies
the
paradoxical
complexities
of
the
palainian
mind
might
be
approximately
correct
the
native
thought
went
smoothly
on
my
name
in
your
symbology
is
twelfth
pilinipsi
by
education
training
and
occupation
i
am
a
chief
dexitroboper
i
perceive
that
you
are
indeed
a
native
of
that
hellish
planet
three
upon
which
it
was
assumed
for
so
long
that
no
life
could
possibly
exist
but
communication
with
your
race
has
been
almost
impossible
heretofore
ah
the
lens
a
remarkable
device
truly
i
would
slay
you
and
take
it
except
for
the
obvious
fact
that
only
you
can
possess
it
what
dismay
and
consternation
flooded
samms
mind
you
already
know
the
lens
no
yours
is
the
first
that
any
of
us
has
perceived
the
mechanics
the
mathematics
and
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
thing
however
are
quite
clear
what
samms
exclaimed
again
you
can
then
produce
lenses
yourselves
by
no
means
any
more
than
you
tellurians
can
there
are
magnitudes
variables
determinants
and
forces
involved
which
no
palainian
will
ever
be
able
to
develop
to
generate
or
to
control
i
see
the
lensman
pulled
himself
together
for
a
first
lensman
he
was
making
a
wretched
showing
indeed
far
from
it
sir
the
monstrosity
assured
him
considering
the
strangeness
of
the
environment
into
which
you
have
voluntarily
flung
yourself
so
senselessly
your
mind
is
well
integrated
and
strong
otherwise
it
would
have
shattered
if
our
positions
were
reversed
the
mere
thought
of
the
raging
heat
of
your
earth
would
come
no
closer
please
the
thing
vanished
reappeared
many
yards
away
her
thoughts
were
a
shudder
of
loathing
of
terror
of
sheer
detestation
but
to
get
on
i
have
been
attempting
to
analyze
and
to
understand
your
purpose
without
success
that
failure
is
not
too
surprising
of
course
since
my
mind
is
weak
and
my
total
power
is
small
explain
your
mission
please
as
simply
as
you
can
weak
small
in
view
of
the
power
the
monstrosity
had
just
shown
samms
probed
for
irony
for
sarcasm
or
pretense
there
was
no
trace
of
anything
of
the
kind
he
tried
then
for
fifteen
solid
minutes
to
explain
the
galactic
patrol
but
at
the
end
the
palainian
only
reaction
was
one
of
blank
i
fail
completely
to
perceive
the
use
of
or
the
need
for
such
an
organization
she
stated
flatly
this
altruism
what
good
is
it
it
is
unthinkable
that
any
other
race
would
take
any
risks
or
exert
any
effort
for
us
any
more
than
we
would
for
them
ignore
and
be
ignored
as
you
must
already
know
is
the
prime
tenet
but
there
is
a
little
commerce
between
our
worlds
your
people
did
not
ignore
our
psychologists
and
you
are
not
ignoring
me
samms
pointed
out
oh
none
of
us
is
perfect
pilinipsi
replied
with
a
mental
shrug
and
what
seemed
to
be
an
airy
wave
of
a
member
that
ideal
like
any
other
can
only
be
approached
asymptotically
never
reached
and
i
being
somewhat
foolish
and
silly
as
well
as
weak
and
vacillant
am
much
less
perfect
than
most
flabbergasted
samms
tried
a
new
tack
i
might
be
able
to
make
my
position
clearer
if
i
knew
you
better
i
know
your
name
and
that
you
are
a
woman
of
palain
seven
it
is
a
measure
of
virgil
samms
real
size
that
he
actually
thought
woman
and
not
merely
female
but
all
i
can
understand
of
your
occupation
is
the
name
you
have
given
it
what
does
a
chief
dexitroboper
do
she
or
he
or
perhaps
it
is
a
supervisor
of
the
work
of
dexitroboping
the
thought
while
perfectly
clear
was
completely
meaningless
to
samms
and
the
palainian
knew
it
she
tried
again
dexitroboping
has
to
do
with
nourishment
no
with
nutrients
ah
farming
agriculture
samms
thought
but
this
time
it
was
the
palainian
who
could
not
grasp
the
concept
hunting
fishing
no
better
show
me
then
please
she
tried
but
demonstration
too
was
useless
for
to
samms
the
palainian
movements
were
pointless
indeed
the
peculiarly
flowing
subtly
changing
thing
darted
back
and
forth
rose
and
fell
appeared
and
disappeared
undergoing
the
while
cyclic
changes
in
shape
and
form
and
size
in
aspect
and
texture
it
was
now
spiny
now
tentacular
now
scaly
now
covered
with
peculiarly
repellent
fronds
each
oozing
a
crimson
slime
but
it
apparently
did
not
anything
whatever
the
net
result
of
all
its
activity
was
apparently
zero
there
it
is
done
pilinipsi
thought
again
came
clear
you
observed
and
understood
you
did
not
that
is
strange
baffling
since
the
lens
did
improve
communication
and
understanding
tremendously
i
hoped
that
it
might
extend
to
the
physical
as
well
but
there
must
be
some
basic
fundamental
difference
the
nature
of
which
is
at
present
obscure
i
wonder
if
i
had
a
lens
too
but
no
but
yes
samms
broke
in
eagerly
why
do
you
go
to
arisia
and
be
tested
for
one
you
have
a
magnificent
a
really
mind
it
is
of
lensman
grade
in
every
respect
except
one
you
simply
to
use
it
me
go
to
arisia
the
thought
would
have
been
in
a
tellurian
a
laugh
of
scorn
how
utterly
silly
how
abysmally
stupid
there
would
be
personal
discomfort
quite
possibly
personal
danger
and
two
lenses
would
be
little
or
no
better
than
one
in
resolving
differences
between
our
two
continua
which
are
probably
in
fact
incommensurable
well
then
samms
thought
almost
viciously
can
you
introduce
me
to
someone
who
is
stupider
sillier
and
more
foolish
than
you
are
not
here
on
pluto
no
the
palainian
took
no
offense
that
was
why
it
was
i
who
interviewed
the
earlier
tellurian
visitors
and
why
i
am
now
conversing
with
you
the
others
avoided
you
i
see
samms
thought
was
grim
how
about
the
home
planet
then
ah
undoubtedly
in
fact
there
is
a
group
a
club
of
such
persons
none
of
them
is
of
course
as
insane
as
aberrant
as
you
are
but
they
are
all
much
more
so
than
i
am
who
of
this
club
would
be
most
interested
in
becoming
a
lensman
tallick
was
the
least
stable
member
of
the
club
when
i
left
seven
kragzex
a
close
second
there
may
of
course
have
been
changes
since
then
but
i
can
not
believe
that
even
tallick
even
tallick
at
his
outrageous
worst
would
be
crazy
enough
to
join
your
patrol
nevertheless
i
must
see
him
myself
can
you
and
will
you
give
me
a
chart
of
a
routing
from
here
to
palain
seven
i
can
and
i
will
nothing
you
have
thought
will
be
of
any
use
to
me
that
will
be
the
easiest
and
quickest
way
of
getting
rid
of
you
the
palainian
spread
a
completely
detailed
chart
in
samms
mind
snapped
the
telepathic
line
and
went
unconcernedly
about
her
incomprehensible
business
samms
mind
reeling
made
his
way
back
to
his
boat
and
took
off
and
as
the
and
the
parsecs
screamed
past
he
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
welter
of
unproductive
speculation
what
were
really
those
palainians
how
could
they
really
exist
as
they
seemed
to
exist
and
why
had
some
of
that
dexitroboper
whatever
meant
thoughts
come
in
so
beautifully
sharp
and
clear
and
plain
while
others
he
knew
that
his
lens
would
receive
and
would
convert
into
his
own
symbology
any
thought
or
message
however
coded
or
garbled
or
however
sent
or
transmitted
the
lens
was
not
at
fault
his
symbology
was
there
were
concepts
things
actualities
occurrences
so
foreign
to
tellurian
experience
that
no
referents
existed
hence
the
human
mind
lacked
the
channels
the
mechanisms
to
grasp
them
he
and
roderick
kinnison
had
glibly
discussed
the
possibility
of
encountering
forms
of
intelligent
life
so
alien
that
humanity
would
have
no
point
whatever
of
contact
with
them
after
what
samms
had
just
gone
through
that
was
more
of
a
possibility
than
either
he
or
his
friend
had
believed
and
he
hoped
grimly
as
he
considered
how
seriously
this
partial
contact
with
the
palainian
had
upset
him
that
the
possibility
would
never
become
a
fact
he
found
the
palainian
system
easily
enough
and
palain
seven
that
planet
of
course
was
almost
as
dark
upon
its
sunward
side
as
upon
the
other
and
its
inhabitants
had
no
use
for
light
instructions
however
had
been
minute
and
exact
hence
samms
had
very
little
trouble
in
locating
the
principal
city
or
rather
the
principal
village
since
there
were
no
real
cities
he
found
the
planet
one
spaceport
what
a
thing
to
call
a
he
checked
back
recalled
exactly
this
part
of
his
interview
with
pluto
chief
dexitroboper
the
place
upon
which
land
had
been
her
thought
when
she
showed
him
exactly
where
it
was
in
relationship
to
the
town
just
that
and
nothing
else
it
had
been
his
mind
not
hers
that
had
supplied
the
docks
and
cradles
the
service
cars
the
officers
and
all
the
other
things
taken
for
granted
in
everywhere
as
samms
knew
them
either
the
palainian
had
not
perceived
the
trappings
with
which
samms
had
invested
her
visualization
or
she
had
not
cared
enough
about
his
misapprehension
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
correcting
it
he
did
not
know
which
the
whole
area
was
as
bare
as
his
hand
except
for
the
pitted
scarred
spots
which
showed
so
clearly
what
driving
blasts
would
do
to
such
inconceivably
cold
rock
and
metal
palainport
was
in
no
way
distinguishable
from
any
other
unimproved
portion
of
the
planet
utterly
bleak
surface
there
were
no
signals
he
had
been
told
of
no
landing
conventions
apparently
it
was
everyone
for
himself
wherefore
samms
tremendous
landing
lights
blazed
out
and
with
their
aid
he
came
safely
to
ground
he
put
on
his
armour
and
strode
to
the
then
changed
his
mind
and
went
to
the
instead
he
had
intended
to
walk
but
in
view
of
the
rugged
and
deserted
field
and
the
completely
unknown
terrain
between
the
field
and
the
town
he
decided
to
ride
the
creep
instead
this
vehicle
while
slow
could
go
literally
anywhere
it
had
a
body
of
magnalloy
it
had
big
soft
tough
tires
it
had
cleated
tracks
it
had
and
it
had
folding
wings
it
had
driving
braking
and
steering
jets
it
could
traverse
the
deserts
of
mars
the
oceans
and
swamps
of
venus
the
crevassed
glaciers
of
earth
the
jagged
frigid
surface
of
an
iron
asteroid
and
the
cratered
fluffy
topography
of
the
moon
if
not
with
equal
speed
at
least
with
equal
safety
samms
released
the
thing
and
drove
it
into
the
cargo
lock
noting
mentally
that
he
would
have
to
exhaust
the
air
of
that
lock
into
space
before
he
again
broke
the
inner
seal
the
ramp
slid
back
into
the
ship
the
cargo
port
closed
here
he
was
should
he
use
his
headlights
or
not
he
did
not
know
the
reaction
to
or
attitude
toward
light
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
while
at
pluto
to
ask
and
it
might
be
important
the
landing
lights
of
his
vessel
might
already
have
done
his
cause
irreparable
harm
he
could
drive
by
starlight
if
he
had
to
but
he
needed
light
and
he
had
not
seen
a
single
living
or
moving
thing
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
a
palainian
within
miles
while
he
had
known
with
his
brain
that
palain
would
be
dark
he
had
expected
to
find
buildings
and
traffic
planes
and
at
least
a
few
and
not
this
vast
nothingness
if
nothing
else
there
be
a
road
from
palain
principal
city
to
its
only
spaceport
but
samms
had
not
seen
it
from
his
vessel
and
he
could
not
see
it
now
at
least
he
could
not
recognize
it
wherefore
he
clutched
in
the
tractor
drive
and
took
off
in
a
straight
line
toward
town
the
going
was
more
than
rough
it
was
really
rugged
but
the
creep
was
built
to
stand
up
under
punishment
and
its
pilot
chair
was
sprung
and
cushioned
to
exactly
the
same
degree
hence
while
the
course
itself
was
infinitely
worse
than
the
smoothly
paved
approaches
to
rigelston
samms
found
this
trip
much
less
bruising
than
the
other
had
been
approaching
the
village
he
dimmed
his
roadlights
and
slowed
down
at
its
edge
he
cut
them
entirely
and
inched
his
way
forward
by
starlight
alone
what
a
town
virgil
samms
had
seen
the
inhabited
places
of
almost
every
planet
of
civilization
he
had
seen
cities
laid
out
in
circles
sectors
ellipses
triangles
squares
parallelopipeds
practically
every
plan
known
to
geometry
he
had
seen
structures
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
narrow
skyscrapers
polyhedra
domes
spheres
and
erect
and
inverted
full
and
truncated
cones
and
pyramids
whatever
the
plan
or
the
shapes
of
the
component
units
however
those
inhabited
places
had
without
exception
been
understandable
but
this
samms
his
eyes
now
completely
could
see
fairly
well
but
the
more
he
saw
the
less
he
grasped
there
was
no
plan
no
coherence
or
unity
whatever
it
was
as
though
a
cosmic
hand
had
flung
a
few
hundreds
of
buildings
of
incredibly
and
senselessly
varied
shapes
and
sizes
and
architectures
upon
an
otherwise
empty
plain
and
as
though
each
structure
had
been
allowed
ever
since
to
remain
in
whatever
location
and
attitude
it
had
chanced
to
fall
here
and
there
were
jumbled
piles
of
three
or
more
utterly
incongruous
structures
there
were
a
few
whose
arrangement
was
almost
orderly
here
and
there
were
large
areas
of
bare
untouched
ground
there
were
no
streets
at
least
nothing
that
the
man
could
recognize
as
such
samms
headed
the
creep
for
one
of
those
open
areas
then
stopped
declutched
the
tracks
set
the
brakes
and
killed
the
engines
go
slow
fellow
he
advised
himself
then
until
you
find
out
what
a
dexitroboper
actually
does
while
working
at
his
trade
do
take
chances
of
interfering
or
of
doing
damage
no
lensman
knew
then
that
were
not
strictly
but
samms
did
know
that
he
had
actually
seen
things
which
he
could
not
understand
he
and
kinnison
had
discussed
such
occurrences
calmly
enough
but
the
actuality
was
enough
to
shake
even
the
mind
of
civilization
first
lensman
he
did
not
need
to
be
any
closer
anyway
he
had
learned
the
palainians
patterns
well
enough
to
lens
them
from
a
vastly
greater
distance
than
his
present
one
this
personal
visit
to
palainopolis
had
been
a
gesture
of
friendliness
not
a
necessity
tallick
kragzex
he
sent
out
the
questing
querying
thought
lensman
virgil
samms
of
sol
three
calling
tallick
and
kragzex
of
palain
seven
kragzex
acknowledging
virgil
samms
a
thought
snapped
back
as
as
precise
as
pilinipsi
had
been
is
tallick
here
or
anywhere
on
the
planet
he
is
here
but
he
is
emmfozing
at
the
moment
he
will
join
us
presently
damnation
there
it
was
again
first
dexitroboping
and
now
this
one
moment
please
samms
requested
i
fail
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
your
thought
so
i
perceive
the
fault
is
of
course
mine
in
not
being
able
to
attune
my
mind
fully
to
yours
do
not
take
this
please
as
any
aspersion
upon
the
character
or
strength
of
your
own
mind
of
course
not
i
am
the
first
tellurian
you
have
met
yes
i
have
exchanged
thoughts
with
one
other
palainian
and
the
same
difficulty
existed
i
can
neither
understand
nor
explain
it
but
it
is
as
though
there
are
differences
between
us
so
fundamental
that
in
some
matters
mutual
comprehension
is
in
fact
impossible
a
masterly
summation
and
undoubtedly
a
true
one
this
emmfozing
then
if
i
read
correctly
your
race
has
only
two
sexes
you
read
correctly
i
can
not
understand
there
is
no
close
analogy
however
emmfozing
has
to
do
with
reproduction
i
see
and
samms
saw
not
only
a
frankness
to
his
experience
but
also
a
new
view
of
both
the
powers
and
the
limitations
of
his
lens
it
was
by
its
very
nature
of
precisionist
grade
it
received
thoughts
and
translated
them
precisely
into
english
there
was
some
leeway
but
not
much
if
any
thought
was
such
that
there
was
no
extremely
close
counterpart
or
referent
in
english
the
lens
would
not
translate
it
at
all
but
would
simply
give
it
a
hitherto
meaningless
symbol
a
symbol
which
would
from
that
time
on
be
associated
by
all
lenses
everywhere
with
that
one
concept
and
no
other
samms
realized
then
that
he
might
some
day
learn
what
a
dexitroboper
actually
did
and
what
the
act
of
emmfozing
actually
was
but
that
he
very
probably
would
not
tallick
joined
them
then
and
samms
again
described
glowingly
as
he
had
done
so
many
times
before
the
galactic
patrol
of
his
imaginings
and
plannings
kragzex
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
such
a
thing
almost
as
abruptly
as
pilinipsi
had
done
but
tallick
lingered
and
wavered
it
is
widely
known
that
i
am
not
entirely
sane
he
admitted
which
may
explain
the
fact
that
i
would
very
much
like
to
have
a
lens
but
i
gather
from
what
you
have
said
that
i
would
probably
not
be
given
a
lens
to
use
purely
for
my
own
selfish
purposes
that
is
my
understanding
samms
agreed
i
was
afraid
so
tallick
mien
was
woebegone
is
the
only
word
for
it
i
have
work
to
do
projects
you
know
of
difficulty
of
extreme
complexity
and
scope
sometimes
even
approaching
danger
a
lens
would
be
of
tremendous
use
how
samms
asked
if
your
work
is
of
enough
importance
to
enough
people
mentor
would
certainly
give
you
a
lens
this
would
benefit
me
only
me
we
of
palain
as
you
probably
already
know
are
selfish
cowardly
furtive
and
sly
of
what
you
call
we
have
no
trace
we
attain
our
ends
by
stealth
by
indirection
by
trickery
and
deceit
ruthlessly
the
lens
was
giving
virgil
samms
the
uncompromisingly
exact
english
equivalent
of
the
palainian
every
thought
we
operate
when
we
must
operate
at
all
openly
with
the
absolutely
irreducible
minimum
of
personal
risk
these
attitudes
and
attributes
will
i
have
no
doubt
preclude
all
possibility
of
lensmanship
for
me
and
for
every
member
of
my
race
not
necessarily
necessarily
although
virgil
samms
did
not
know
it
this
was
one
of
the
really
critical
moments
in
the
coming
into
being
of
the
galactic
patrol
by
a
conscious
a
tremendous
effort
the
first
lensman
was
lifting
himself
above
the
narrow
intolerant
prejudices
of
human
experience
and
was
consciously
attempting
to
see
the
whole
through
mentor
arisian
mind
instead
of
through
his
tellurian
own
that
virgil
samms
was
the
first
human
being
to
be
born
with
the
ability
to
accomplish
that
feat
even
partially
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
was
the
first
wearer
of
the
lens
not
necessarily
first
lensman
virgil
samms
said
and
meant
he
was
inexpressibly
shocked
revolted
in
every
human
fiber
by
what
this
unhuman
monster
had
so
frankly
and
callously
thought
there
were
however
many
things
which
no
human
being
ever
could
understand
and
there
was
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
this
tallick
had
a
really
tremendous
mind
you
have
said
that
your
mind
is
feeble
if
so
there
is
no
simple
expression
of
the
weakness
of
mine
i
can
perceive
only
one
the
strictly
human
facet
of
the
truth
in
a
broader
view
it
is
distinctly
possible
that
your
motivation
is
at
least
as
as
mine
and
to
complete
my
argument
you
work
with
other
palainians
do
you
not
to
reach
a
common
goal
at
times
yes
then
you
can
conceive
of
the
desirability
of
working
with
entities
toward
an
end
which
would
benefit
both
races
postulating
such
an
end
yes
but
i
am
unable
to
visualize
any
such
have
you
any
specific
project
in
mind
not
at
the
moment
samms
ducked
he
had
already
fired
every
shot
in
his
locker
i
am
quite
certain
however
that
if
you
go
to
arisia
you
will
be
informed
of
several
such
projects
there
was
a
period
of
silence
then
i
believe
that
i
go
to
arisia
at
that
tallick
exclaimed
brightly
i
will
make
a
deal
with
your
friend
mentor
i
will
give
him
a
share
say
fifty
percent
or
forty
of
the
time
and
effort
i
save
on
my
own
projects
just
so
you
tallick
samms
concealed
right
manfully
his
real
opinion
of
the
palainian
scheme
when
can
you
go
right
now
by
no
means
i
must
first
finish
this
project
a
year
perhaps
or
more
or
possibly
less
who
knows
tallick
cut
communications
and
samms
frowned
he
did
not
know
the
exact
length
of
seven
year
but
he
knew
that
it
was
long
long
chapter
a
small
black
commanded
jointly
by
master
pilot
john
kinnison
and
master
electronicist
mason
northrop
was
blasting
along
a
course
very
close
indeed
to
in
equipment
and
personnel
however
she
was
not
an
ordinary
scout
her
control
room
was
so
full
of
electronics
racks
and
computing
machines
that
there
was
scarcely
footway
in
any
direction
her
graduated
circles
and
vernier
scales
were
of
a
size
and
a
fineness
usually
seen
only
in
the
great
vessels
of
the
galactic
survey
and
her
crew
instead
of
the
usual
men
numbered
only
seven
one
cook
three
engineers
and
three
watch
officers
for
some
time
the
young
third
officer
then
at
the
board
had
been
studying
something
on
his
plate
comparing
it
minutely
with
the
chart
clipped
into
the
rack
in
front
of
him
now
he
turned
with
a
highly
exaggerated
deference
to
the
two
lensmen
sirs
which
of
your
magnificences
is
officially
the
commander
of
this
here
bucket
of
odds
and
ends
at
the
present
instant
him
jack
used
his
cigarette
as
a
pointer
the
guy
with
the
misplaced
plucked
eyebrow
on
his
upper
lip
i
do
come
on
duty
until
sixteen
hundred
hours
one
precious
tellurian
minute
yet
in
which
to
dream
of
the
beauties
of
earth
so
distant
in
space
and
in
both
past
and
future
time
huh
beauties
plural
next
time
i
see
a
party
whose
pictures
are
cluttering
up
this
whole
ship
i
tell
her
about
your
polygamous
ideas
i
ignore
that
crack
about
my
mustache
though
since
you
ca
raise
one
of
your
own
i
ignoring
you
too
like
this
see
ostentatiously
turning
his
back
upon
the
lounging
kinnison
northrop
stepped
carefully
over
three
or
four
breadboard
hookups
and
stared
into
the
plate
over
the
watch
officer
shoulder
he
then
studied
the
chart
ist
stu
i
do
see
a
thing
more
jack
line
than
yours
mase
this
system
we
headed
for
is
a
triple
and
the
chart
says
it
a
double
natural
enough
of
course
this
whole
region
is
unexplored
so
the
charts
are
astronomicals
not
surveys
but
that
makes
us
prime
discoverers
and
our
commanding
officer
and
the
book
says
not
has
got
to
that
me
now
jack
announced
striding
grandly
toward
the
plate
amscray
oobsbay
will
name
the
baby
will
report
will
go
down
in
history
bounce
back
small
fry
you
were
at
the
time
of
discovery
northrop
placed
a
huge
hand
flat
against
jack
face
and
pushed
gently
you
go
down
sure
enough
not
in
history
but
from
a
knock
on
the
knob
if
you
try
to
steal
any
thunder
away
from
and
besides
you
name
it
what
a
thought
and
what
would
you
name
it
i
suppose
far
from
it
my
boy
he
had
intended
doing
just
that
but
now
he
did
not
quite
dare
after
our
project
of
course
the
planet
we
heading
for
will
be
zabriska
the
suns
will
be
and
in
order
of
size
and
the
watch
officer
then
on
duty
lieutenant
stuart
rawlings
will
engross
these
and
all
other
pertinent
data
in
the
log
can
you
classify
from
here
jack
i
can
make
some
guesses
close
enough
probably
for
discovery
work
then
after
a
few
minutes
two
giants
a
and
a
bluish
yellow
and
a
yellow
dwarf
dwarf
in
the
trojan
that
would
be
my
guess
since
that
is
the
only
place
it
could
stay
very
long
but
you
ca
tell
much
from
one
look
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
though
unless
your
zabriska
is
in
a
system
straight
beyond
this
one
it
got
to
be
a
planet
of
the
big
fellow
himself
and
brother
that
sun
is
it
got
to
be
here
jack
i
have
made
big
an
error
in
reading
a
beam
since
i
was
a
sophomore
i
buy
that
well
we
close
enough
i
guess
jack
killed
the
driving
blasts
but
not
the
bergenholm
the
inertialess
vessel
stopped
instantaneously
in
open
space
now
we
got
to
find
out
which
one
of
those
twelve
or
fifteen
planets
was
on
our
line
when
that
last
message
was
sent
there
we
stable
enough
i
hope
open
your
cameras
mase
pull
the
first
plate
in
fifteen
minutes
that
ought
to
give
me
enough
track
so
i
can
start
the
job
since
we
at
a
wide
angle
to
their
ecliptic
the
work
went
on
for
an
hour
or
so
then
something
coming
from
the
direction
of
tellus
the
watch
officer
reported
big
and
fast
shall
i
hail
her
might
as
well
but
the
stranger
hailed
first
calling
are
you
in
trouble
identify
yourself
please
acknowledging
no
trouble
northrop
jack
came
virgil
samms
highly
concerned
thought
the
superdreadnaught
flashed
alongside
a
bare
few
hundred
miles
away
and
stopped
why
did
you
stop
this
is
where
our
signal
came
from
sir
oh
a
hundred
thoughts
raced
through
samms
mind
too
fast
and
too
fragmentary
to
be
intelligible
i
see
you
computing
would
it
throw
you
off
too
much
to
go
inert
and
match
intrinsics
so
that
i
can
join
you
no
sir
i
got
everything
i
need
for
a
while
samms
came
aboard
three
lensmen
studied
the
chart
cavenda
is
there
samms
pointed
out
trenco
is
there
off
to
one
side
i
felt
sure
that
your
signal
originated
on
cavenda
but
zabriska
here
while
on
almost
the
same
line
is
less
than
half
as
far
from
tellus
he
did
not
ask
whether
the
two
young
lensmen
were
sure
of
their
findings
he
knew
this
arouses
my
curiosity
no
end
does
it
merely
complicate
the
thionite
problem
or
does
it
set
up
an
entirely
new
problem
go
ahead
boys
with
whatever
you
were
going
to
do
next
jack
had
already
determined
that
the
planet
they
wanted
was
the
second
out
two
he
drove
the
scout
as
close
to
the
planet
as
he
could
without
losing
complete
coverage
stationed
it
on
the
line
toward
sol
now
we
wait
a
bit
he
answered
according
to
recent
periodicity
not
less
than
four
hours
and
not
more
than
ten
with
the
next
signal
nail
that
transmitter
down
to
within
a
few
feet
got
your
spotting
screens
full
out
mase
periodicity
samms
snapped
it
has
improved
then
lately
very
much
sir
that
helps
immensely
with
george
olmstead
harvesting
broadleaf
it
would
it
is
still
one
problem
while
we
wait
shall
we
study
the
planet
a
little
they
explored
finding
that
two
was
a
disappointing
planet
indeed
it
was
small
waterless
airless
utterly
featureless
utterly
barren
there
were
no
elevations
no
depressions
no
visible
markings
whatever
not
even
a
meteor
crater
every
square
yard
of
its
surface
was
apparently
exactly
like
every
other
no
rotation
jack
reported
looking
up
from
the
bolometer
that
is
not
inhabited
and
never
will
be
i
beginning
to
wonder
so
am
i
now
northrop
admitted
i
still
say
that
those
signals
came
from
this
line
and
distance
but
it
looks
as
though
they
must
have
been
sent
from
a
ship
if
so
now
that
we
here
particularly
the
there
will
be
no
more
signals
not
necessarily
again
samms
mind
transcended
his
tellurian
experience
and
knowledge
he
did
not
suspect
the
truth
but
he
was
not
jumping
at
conclusions
there
may
be
highly
intelligent
life
even
upon
such
a
planet
as
this
they
waited
and
in
a
few
hours
a
communications
beam
snapped
into
life
ready
ready
ready
it
said
briskly
for
not
quite
one
minute
but
that
was
time
enough
northrop
yelped
a
string
of
numbers
jack
blasted
the
little
vessel
forward
and
downward
the
three
watch
officers
at
their
plates
stabbed
their
visibeams
and
along
the
indicated
line
and
bore
straight
through
the
planet
if
you
have
to
they
may
be
on
the
other
side
jack
cautioned
sharply
they
are
it
here
on
this
side
rawlings
saw
it
first
nothing
much
to
it
though
it
looks
like
a
relay
station
a
i
be
a
jack
started
to
express
an
unexpurgated
opinion
but
shut
himself
up
young
cubs
did
not
swear
in
front
of
the
first
lensman
let
land
sir
and
look
the
place
over
anyway
by
all
means
they
landed
and
cautiously
disembarked
the
horizon
while
actually
quite
a
little
closer
than
that
of
earth
seemed
much
more
distant
because
there
was
nothing
whatever
no
tree
no
shrub
no
rock
or
pebble
not
even
the
slightest
ripple
to
break
the
geometrical
perfection
of
that
surface
of
smooth
hard
blindingly
reflective
fiendishly
hot
white
sand
samms
was
highly
dubious
at
first
a
of
four
hundred
degrees
was
not
to
be
taken
lightly
he
did
not
at
all
like
the
looks
of
that
sun
and
in
his
wildest
imaginings
he
had
never
pictured
such
a
desert
their
however
were
very
well
insulated
particularly
as
to
the
feet
and
highly
polished
and
in
lieu
of
atmosphere
there
was
an
almost
perfect
vacuum
they
could
stand
it
for
a
while
the
box
which
housed
the
relay
station
was
made
of
metal
and
was
roughly
cubical
in
shape
perhaps
five
feet
on
a
side
it
was
so
buried
that
its
upper
edge
was
flush
with
the
surface
its
top
which
was
practically
indistinguishable
from
the
surrounding
sand
was
not
bolted
or
welded
but
was
simply
laid
on
loose
previous
inspection
having
proved
that
the
thing
was
not
jack
lifted
the
cover
by
one
edge
and
all
three
lensmen
studied
the
mechanisms
at
close
range
learning
nothing
new
there
was
an
extremely
sensitive
receiver
a
highly
directional
sender
a
beautifully
precise
director
and
an
eternal
powerpack
there
was
nothing
else
what
next
sir
northrop
asked
there
be
an
incoming
signal
probably
in
a
couple
of
days
shall
we
stick
around
and
see
whether
it
comes
in
from
cavenda
or
not
you
and
jack
had
better
wait
yes
samms
thought
for
minutes
i
do
not
believe
now
that
the
signal
will
come
from
cavenda
or
that
it
will
ever
come
twice
from
the
same
direction
but
we
will
have
to
make
sure
but
i
ca
see
any
for
it
i
think
i
can
sir
this
was
northrop
specialty
no
could
possibly
hit
tellus
from
here
except
by
accident
with
a
beam
and
they
ca
use
a
because
it
would
have
to
be
on
all
the
time
and
would
be
as
easy
to
trace
as
the
mississippi
river
but
this
planet
did
all
its
settling
ages
ago
which
is
undoubtedly
why
they
picked
it
out
and
that
director
in
there
is
a
marchanti
the
second
marchanti
i
have
ever
seen
whatever
is
jack
put
in
and
even
samms
thought
a
question
the
most
precise
thing
ever
built
the
specialist
explained
accuracy
limited
only
by
that
of
determination
of
relative
motions
give
me
an
accurate
enough
equation
to
feed
into
it
like
that
tape
is
doing
and
two
sighting
shots
and
i
guarantee
to
pour
an
beam
into
any
two
foot
cup
on
earth
my
guess
is
that
it
aimed
at
some
particular
on
one
of
the
solar
planets
i
could
spoil
its
aim
easily
enough
but
i
do
suppose
that
is
what
you
after
decidedly
not
we
want
to
trace
them
without
exciting
any
more
suspicion
than
is
absolutely
necessary
how
often
would
you
say
do
they
have
to
come
here
to
service
this
station
change
tapes
and
whatever
else
might
be
necessary
change
tapes
is
all
not
very
often
by
the
size
of
those
reels
if
they
know
the
relative
motions
exactly
enough
they
could
compute
as
far
ahead
as
they
care
to
i
been
timing
that
reel
it
got
pretty
close
to
three
months
left
on
it
and
more
than
that
much
has
been
used
it
no
wonder
we
did
see
anything
samms
straightened
up
and
stared
out
across
the
frightful
waste
look
there
i
thought
i
saw
something
move
it
moving
there
something
moving
closer
than
that
and
it
really
funny
jack
laughed
deeply
it
like
the
shaft
and
all
of
an
river
rolling
along
as
unconcernedly
as
you
please
he
wo
miss
me
by
over
four
feet
but
he
is
swerving
a
hair
i
think
i
block
him
off
just
to
see
what
he
does
be
careful
jack
samms
cautioned
sharply
do
touch
it
it
may
be
charged
or
worse
jack
took
the
metal
cover
which
he
was
still
holding
and
by
working
it
back
and
forth
edgewise
in
the
sand
made
of
it
a
vertical
barrier
squarely
across
the
thing
path
the
traveler
paid
no
attention
did
not
alter
its
steady
pace
of
a
couple
of
miles
per
hour
it
measured
about
twelve
inches
long
over
all
its
extremities
were
perhaps
two
inches
wide
and
three
inches
in
diameter
do
you
think
it
actually
sir
in
a
place
like
this
i
sure
of
it
watch
carefully
it
struck
the
barrier
and
stopped
that
is
its
forward
motion
stopped
but
its
rolling
did
not
its
rate
of
revolution
did
not
change
it
either
did
not
know
or
did
not
care
that
its
drivers
were
slipping
on
the
smooth
hard
sand
that
it
could
not
climb
the
vertical
metal
plate
that
it
was
not
getting
anywhere
what
a
brain
northrop
chortled
squatting
down
closer
why
it
back
up
or
turn
around
it
may
be
alive
but
it
certainly
is
very
bright
the
creature
now
in
the
shadow
of
the
helmet
slowed
down
abruptly
went
limp
collapsed
get
out
of
his
light
jack
snapped
and
pushed
his
friend
violently
away
and
as
the
vicious
sunlight
struck
it
the
native
revived
and
began
to
revolve
as
vigorously
as
before
i
got
a
hunch
sounds
screwy
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
but
it
acts
like
an
eats
energy
raw
and
straight
no
storage
capacity
on
this
world
he
would
need
it
a
few
more
seconds
in
the
shade
would
probably
have
killed
him
but
there
no
shade
here
therefore
he
ca
be
dangerous
he
reached
out
and
touched
the
middle
of
the
revolving
shaft
nothing
happened
he
turned
it
at
right
angles
to
the
plate
the
thing
rolled
away
in
a
straight
line
perfectly
contented
with
the
new
direction
he
recaptured
it
and
stuck
a
lightly
into
the
sand
just
ahead
of
its
shaft
and
just
inside
one
paddle
wheel
around
and
around
that
slim
wire
the
creature
went
unable
it
seemed
to
escape
from
even
such
a
simple
trap
perfectly
willing
it
seemed
to
spend
all
the
rest
of
its
life
traversing
that
tiny
circle
a
brain
is
right
mase
jack
exclaimed
a
brain
this
is
wonderful
boys
really
wonderful
something
completely
new
to
our
science
samms
thought
was
deep
with
feeling
i
am
going
to
see
if
i
can
reach
its
mind
or
consciousness
would
you
like
to
come
along
we
samms
tuned
low
and
probed
lower
and
lower
deeper
and
deeper
and
jack
and
mase
stayed
with
him
the
thing
was
certainly
alive
it
throbbed
and
vibrated
with
vitality
equally
certainly
it
was
not
very
intelligent
but
it
had
a
definite
consciousness
of
its
own
existence
and
therefore
however
tiny
and
primitive
a
mind
although
its
rudimentary
ego
could
neither
receive
nor
transmit
thought
it
knew
that
it
was
a
fontema
that
it
must
roll
and
roll
and
roll
endlessly
that
by
virtue
of
determined
rolling
its
species
would
continue
and
would
increase
well
that
one
for
the
book
jack
exclaimed
but
samms
was
entranced
i
would
like
to
find
one
or
two
more
of
them
to
find
out
i
think
i
the
time
can
you
see
any
more
of
them
either
of
you
no
but
we
can
find
some
stu
northrop
called
yes
look
around
will
you
find
us
a
couple
more
of
these
fontema
things
and
flick
them
over
here
with
a
tractor
coming
up
and
in
a
few
seconds
they
were
there
are
you
photographing
this
lance
samms
called
the
chief
communications
officer
of
the
we
certainly
are
sir
all
of
it
what
are
they
anyway
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
i
do
know
probably
no
one
of
the
three
strictly
speaking
like
to
take
a
couple
back
to
tellus
but
i
afraid
that
they
die
even
under
an
atomic
lamp
we
report
to
the
society
jack
liberated
his
captive
and
aimed
it
to
pass
within
a
few
feet
of
one
of
the
newcomers
but
the
two
fontemas
did
not
ignore
each
other
both
swerved
so
that
they
came
together
wheel
to
wheel
the
shafts
bent
toward
each
other
each
into
a
right
angle
the
angles
touched
and
fused
the
point
of
fusion
swelled
rapidly
into
a
double
lump
the
doubled
in
length
the
lump
split
into
four
became
four
perfect
four
fontemas
rolled
away
from
the
spot
upon
which
two
had
met
their
courses
forming
two
mutually
perpendicular
straight
lines
beautiful
samms
exclaimed
and
notice
boys
the
method
of
avoiding
inbreeding
upon
a
perfectly
smooth
planet
such
as
this
no
two
of
those
four
can
ever
meet
and
the
chance
is
almost
vanishingly
small
that
any
of
their
offspring
will
ever
meet
but
afraid
i
been
wasting
time
take
me
back
out
to
the
please
and
i
be
on
my
way
you
do
seem
at
all
optimistic
sir
jack
ventured
as
the
approached
the
unfortunately
i
am
not
the
signal
will
almost
certainly
come
in
from
an
unpredictable
direction
from
a
ship
so
far
away
that
even
a
cruiser
could
not
get
close
enough
to
her
to
detect
just
a
minute
rod
he
lensed
the
elder
kinnison
so
sharply
that
both
young
lensmen
jumped
what
is
it
virge
samms
explained
rapidly
concluding
so
i
would
like
to
have
you
throw
a
globe
of
scouts
around
this
whole
zabriskan
system
one
detet
a
out
and
one
detet
apart
so
as
to
be
able
to
slap
a
tracer
onto
any
ship
laying
a
beam
to
this
planet
from
any
direction
whatever
it
would
not
take
too
many
scouts
would
it
footnote
a
detet
the
distance
at
which
one
can
detect
another
ees
no
but
it
would
be
worth
while
why
not
because
it
would
prove
a
thing
except
what
we
already
know
that
spaceways
is
involved
in
the
thionite
racket
the
ship
would
be
clean
merely
another
relay
oh
you
probably
right
if
virgil
samms
was
in
the
least
put
out
at
this
cavalier
dismissal
of
his
idea
he
made
no
sign
he
thought
intensely
for
a
couple
of
minutes
you
right
i
will
have
to
work
from
the
cavenda
end
how
are
you
coming
with
operation
bennett
nice
kinnison
enthused
when
you
get
a
couple
of
days
come
over
and
see
it
grow
this
is
a
fine
world
virge
it
be
ready
i
do
that
samms
broke
the
connection
and
called
dronvire
the
only
change
here
is
for
the
worse
the
rigellian
reported
tersely
the
slight
positive
correlation
between
deaths
from
thionite
and
the
arrival
of
spaceways
vessels
has
disappeared
there
was
no
need
to
elaborate
on
that
bare
statement
both
lensmen
knew
what
it
meant
the
enemy
either
in
anticipation
of
statistical
analysis
or
for
economic
reasons
was
rationing
his
small
supply
of
the
drug
and
dalnalten
was
very
much
unlike
his
usual
equable
self
he
was
glum
and
unhappy
so
much
so
that
it
took
much
urging
to
make
him
report
at
all
we
have
as
you
know
put
our
best
operatives
to
work
on
the
lines
he
said
finally
half
sullenly
we
have
secured
quite
a
little
data
the
accumulating
facts
however
point
more
and
more
definitely
toward
an
utterly
preposterous
conclusion
can
you
think
of
any
valid
reason
why
the
exports
and
imports
of
thionite
between
tellus
and
mars
mars
and
venus
and
venus
and
tellus
should
all
be
exactly
equal
to
each
other
precisely
that
is
why
knobos
and
i
are
not
yet
ready
to
present
even
a
preliminary
report
then
jill
i
ca
prove
it
any
more
than
i
could
before
but
pretty
sure
that
morgan
is
the
boss
i
have
drawn
every
picture
i
can
think
of
with
isaacson
in
the
driver
seat
but
none
of
them
fit
she
paused
questioningly
i
am
already
reconciled
to
adopting
that
view
at
least
as
a
working
hypothesis
go
ahead
the
fact
seems
to
be
that
morgan
has
always
had
all
the
of
the
nationalists
under
his
thumb
now
he
and
his
man
friday
representative
flierce
are
wooing
all
the
radicals
and
liberals
on
our
side
of
both
senate
and
house
a
new
technique
for
him
and
they
offering
plenty
of
the
right
kind
of
bait
he
has
the
commentators
guessing
but
there
no
doubt
whatever
in
my
mind
that
he
is
aiming
at
next
election
day
and
our
galactic
council
and
you
and
dronvire
are
sitting
idly
by
doing
nothing
of
course
of
course
jill
giggled
but
sobered
quickly
he
a
smooth
worker
dad
we
are
organizing
of
course
and
putting
out
propaganda
of
our
own
but
there
so
pitifully
little
that
we
can
actually
look
and
listen
to
this
for
a
minute
and
you
see
what
i
mean
in
her
distant
room
jill
manipulated
a
reel
and
flipped
a
switch
a
plate
came
to
life
showing
morgan
big
sweating
passionately
earnest
face
and
who
these
lensmen
anyway
morgan
voice
bellowed
passionate
conviction
in
every
syllable
they
are
the
hired
minions
of
the
classes
stabbers
in
the
back
crooks
and
scoundrels
tools
of
ruthless
wealth
they
are
hirelings
of
the
bankers
those
unspeakable
excrescences
on
the
body
politic
who
are
still
grinding
down
into
the
dirt
under
an
iron
heel
the
face
of
the
common
man
in
the
guise
of
democracy
they
are
trying
to
set
up
the
worst
the
most
outrageous
tyranny
that
this
universe
has
ever
jill
snapped
the
switch
viciously
and
a
lot
of
people
that
that
she
almost
snarled
if
they
had
the
brains
of
a
of
even
that
zabriskan
fontema
mase
told
me
about
they
would
but
they
i
know
they
do
we
have
known
all
along
that
he
is
a
masterly
actor
we
now
know
that
he
is
more
than
that
yes
and
we
finding
out
that
no
appeal
to
reason
no
psychological
will
work
dronvire
and
i
agree
that
you
to
arrange
matters
so
that
you
can
do
solid
months
of
stumping
yourself
personally
it
may
come
to
that
but
there
a
lot
of
other
things
to
do
first
samms
broke
the
connection
and
thought
he
did
not
consciously
try
to
exclude
the
two
youths
but
his
mind
was
working
so
fast
and
in
such
a
disjointed
fashion
that
they
could
catch
only
a
few
fragments
the
incomprehensible
vastness
of
space
tracing
detection
cavenda
one
tiny
fast
moving
moon
back
and
solidly
to
detection
mase
samms
thought
then
carefully
as
a
specialist
in
such
things
why
is
it
that
the
detectors
of
the
smallest
scout
lifeboat
even
have
practically
the
same
range
as
those
of
the
largest
liners
and
battleships
noise
level
and
hash
sir
from
the
atomics
but
ca
they
be
screened
out
not
entirely
sir
without
blocking
reception
completely
i
see
suppose
then
that
all
atomics
aboard
were
to
be
shut
down
that
for
the
necessary
heat
and
light
we
use
electricity
from
storage
or
primary
batteries
or
from
a
generator
driven
by
an
motor
or
a
could
the
range
of
detection
then
be
increased
tremendously
sir
my
guess
is
that
the
limiting
factor
would
then
be
the
cosmics
i
hope
you
right
while
you
are
waiting
for
the
next
signal
to
come
in
you
might
work
out
a
preliminary
design
for
such
a
detector
if
as
i
anticipate
this
zabriska
proves
to
be
a
dead
end
operation
zabriska
ends
here
becomes
a
part
of
zwilnik
and
you
two
will
follow
me
at
max
to
tellus
you
jack
are
very
badly
needed
on
operation
boskone
you
and
i
mase
will
make
appropriate
alterations
aboard
a
vessel
of
the
patrol
chapter
approaching
cavenda
in
his
converted
virgil
samms
cut
his
drive
killed
his
atomics
and
turned
on
his
detectors
for
five
full
detets
in
every
direction
throughout
a
spherical
volume
over
ten
detets
in
diameter
space
was
void
of
ships
some
activity
was
apparent
upon
the
planet
dead
ahead
but
the
first
lensman
did
not
worry
about
that
the
would
of
course
have
atomics
in
their
plants
even
if
there
were
no
actually
on
the
planet
which
there
probably
were
what
he
did
worry
about
was
detection
there
would
be
plenty
of
detectors
probably
automatic
not
only
ordinary
but
electros
and
radars
as
well
he
flashed
up
to
within
one
and
a
quarter
detets
stopped
and
checked
again
space
was
still
empty
then
after
making
a
series
of
observations
he
went
inert
and
established
an
intrinsic
velocity
which
he
hoped
would
be
close
enough
he
again
shut
off
his
atomics
and
started
the
diesel
engine
which
would
do
its
best
to
replace
them
that
best
was
none
too
good
but
it
would
do
besides
driving
the
bergenholm
it
could
furnish
enough
kilodynes
of
thrust
to
produce
a
velocity
many
times
greater
than
any
attainable
by
inert
matter
it
used
a
lot
of
oxygen
per
minute
but
it
would
not
run
for
very
many
minutes
with
her
atomics
out
of
action
his
ship
would
not
register
upon
the
plates
of
the
detectors
universally
used
since
she
was
nevertheless
traveling
faster
than
light
neither
electromagnetic
nor
radar
could
see
her
good
enough
samms
was
not
the
system
best
computer
nor
did
he
have
the
finest
instruments
his
positional
error
could
be
corrected
easily
enough
but
as
he
drove
nearer
and
nearer
to
cavenda
keeping
toward
the
last
in
line
with
its
one
small
moon
he
wondered
more
and
more
as
to
how
much
of
an
allowance
he
should
make
for
error
in
his
intrinsic
which
he
had
set
up
practically
by
guess
and
there
was
another
variable
the
he
slowed
down
to
just
over
one
light
but
even
at
that
comparatively
slow
speed
an
error
of
one
millisecond
at
meant
a
displacement
of
two
hundred
miles
he
switched
the
spotter
into
the
berg
circuit
set
it
for
three
hundred
miles
and
waited
tensely
at
his
controls
the
relays
clicked
the
driving
force
expired
the
vessel
went
inert
samms
eyes
flashing
from
instrument
to
instrument
told
him
that
matters
could
have
been
worse
his
intrinsic
was
neither
straight
up
as
he
had
hoped
nor
straight
down
as
he
had
feared
but
almost
exactly
between
the
two
straight
out
he
discovered
that
fact
just
in
time
in
another
second
or
two
he
would
have
been
out
beyond
the
moon
protecting
bulk
and
thus
detectable
from
cavenda
he
went
free
flashed
back
to
the
opposite
boundary
of
his
area
of
safety
went
inert
and
put
the
full
power
of
the
bellowing
diesel
to
the
task
of
bucking
down
his
erroneous
intrinsic
losing
altitude
continuously
again
and
again
he
repeated
the
maneuver
and
thus
grimly
and
stubbornly
he
fought
his
ship
to
ground
he
was
very
glad
to
see
that
the
surface
of
the
satellite
was
rougher
rockier
ruggeder
and
more
cratered
even
than
that
of
earth
luna
upon
such
a
terrain
as
this
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
to
spot
even
a
moving
vessel
if
it
moved
carefully
by
a
series
of
short
and
careful
inertialess
hops
correcting
his
intrinsic
velocity
after
each
one
by
an
inert
collision
with
the
ground
he
maneuvered
his
vessel
into
such
a
position
that
enormous
globe
hung
directly
overhead
breathing
a
profoundly
deep
breath
of
relief
he
killed
the
big
engine
cut
in
his
accumulators
and
turned
on
detector
and
he
would
see
what
he
could
see
his
detectors
showed
that
there
was
only
one
point
of
activity
on
the
whole
planet
he
located
it
precisely
then
after
cutting
his
to
minimum
power
he
approached
it
gingerly
yard
by
yard
stopped
as
he
had
more
than
half
expected
there
was
a
block
a
big
one
almost
two
miles
in
diameter
it
would
be
almost
directly
beneath
him
or
rather
almost
straight
overhead
in
about
three
hours
samms
had
brought
along
a
telescope
considerably
more
powerful
than
the
telescopic
visiplate
of
his
scout
since
the
surface
gravity
of
this
moon
was
low
scarcely
that
of
earth
he
had
no
difficulty
in
lugging
the
parts
out
of
the
ship
or
in
setting
the
thing
up
but
even
the
telescope
did
not
do
much
good
the
moon
was
close
to
cavenda
as
astronomical
distances
go
but
really
astronomical
optical
instruments
simply
are
not
portable
thus
the
lensman
saw
something
that
by
sufficient
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
have
been
a
factory
and
eyes
straining
at
the
tantalizing
limit
of
visibility
he
even
made
himself
believe
that
he
saw
a
object
and
a
darkly
circular
blob
either
of
which
could
have
been
the
of
the
outlaws
he
was
sure
however
of
two
facts
there
were
no
real
cities
upon
cavenda
there
were
no
modern
spaceports
or
even
he
dismounted
the
stored
it
set
his
detectors
and
waited
he
had
to
sleep
at
times
of
course
but
any
ordinary
detector
rig
can
be
set
to
sound
off
at
any
change
in
its
status
and
samms
was
no
ordinary
rig
wherefore
when
the
vessel
took
off
samms
left
cavenda
as
unobtrusively
as
he
had
approached
it
and
swung
into
that
vessel
line
samms
strategy
had
been
worked
out
long
since
on
his
diesel
at
a
distance
of
just
over
one
detet
he
would
follow
the
outlaw
as
fast
as
he
could
long
enough
to
establish
his
line
he
would
then
switch
to
atomic
drive
and
close
up
to
between
one
and
two
detets
then
again
go
onto
diesel
for
a
check
he
would
keep
this
up
for
as
long
as
might
prove
necessary
as
far
as
any
of
the
lensmen
knew
spaceways
always
used
regular
liners
or
freighters
in
this
business
and
this
scout
was
much
faster
than
any
such
vessel
and
even
if
highly
improbable
thought
the
enemy
ship
was
faster
than
his
own
it
would
still
be
within
range
of
detectors
when
it
got
to
wherever
it
was
that
it
was
going
but
how
wrong
samms
was
at
his
first
check
instead
of
being
not
over
two
detets
away
the
quarry
was
three
and
a
half
at
the
second
the
distance
was
four
and
a
quarter
at
the
third
almost
exactly
five
scowling
samms
watched
the
erstwhile
brilliant
point
of
light
fade
into
darkness
that
circular
blob
that
he
had
almost
seen
then
had
been
the
but
it
had
not
been
a
sphere
as
he
had
supposed
instead
it
had
been
a
sticking
sharp
tail
down
in
the
ground
this
was
the
result
but
ideas
had
blown
up
under
him
before
they
probably
would
again
he
resumed
atomic
drive
and
made
arrangements
with
the
port
admiral
to
rendezvous
with
him
and
the
at
the
earliest
possible
time
what
is
there
along
that
line
he
demanded
of
the
chief
pilot
even
before
junction
had
been
made
nothing
sir
that
we
know
of
that
worthy
reported
after
studying
his
charts
he
boarded
the
gigantic
ship
of
war
and
with
kinnison
pored
over
those
same
charts
your
best
bet
is
eridan
i
think
kinnison
concluded
finally
not
too
near
your
line
but
they
could
very
easily
figure
that
a
dogleg
would
be
a
good
investment
and
spaceways
owns
it
you
know
from
core
to
planetary
limits
the
richest
uranium
mines
in
existence
made
to
order
nobody
would
suspect
a
uranium
ship
how
about
throwing
a
globe
around
eridan
samms
thought
for
minutes
no
not
yet
at
least
we
do
know
enough
yet
i
know
it
that
why
it
looks
to
me
like
a
good
time
and
place
to
learn
something
kinnison
argued
we
know
almost
know
at
least
that
a
ship
carrying
thionite
has
just
landed
there
this
is
the
hottest
lead
we
had
i
say
englobe
the
planet
declare
martial
law
and
not
let
anything
in
or
out
until
we
find
it
somebody
there
must
know
something
a
lot
more
than
we
do
i
say
hunt
him
out
and
make
him
talk
you
just
popping
off
rod
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
nabbing
a
few
of
the
small
fry
is
enough
we
ca
move
openly
until
we
can
strike
high
i
suppose
not
kinnison
grumbled
but
we
know
so
little
virge
little
enough
samms
agreed
of
the
three
main
divisions
only
the
political
aspect
is
at
all
clear
in
the
drug
division
we
know
where
thionite
comes
from
and
where
it
is
processed
and
eridan
may
be
probably
is
another
link
on
the
other
end
we
know
a
lot
of
peddlers
and
a
few
middlemen
nobody
higher
we
have
no
actual
knowledge
whatever
as
to
who
the
are
or
how
they
work
and
it
the
bosses
we
want
concerning
the
pirates
we
know
even
less
may
be
no
more
a
man
name
than
is
before
you
get
too
far
away
from
the
subject
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
eridan
nothing
for
the
moment
would
be
best
i
believe
however
knobos
and
dalnalten
should
switch
their
attention
from
spaceways
passenger
liners
to
the
uranium
ships
from
eridan
to
all
three
of
the
inner
planets
check
check
particularly
since
it
explains
so
beautifully
the
they
have
been
on
so
long
chasing
the
same
packages
of
dope
backwards
and
forwards
so
many
times
that
the
corners
of
the
boxes
got
worn
round
we
got
to
get
the
top
men
and
they
smart
which
reminds
me
morgan
as
big
boss
does
not
square
up
with
the
morgan
that
you
and
fairchild
smacked
down
so
easily
when
he
tried
to
investigate
the
hill
a
chiseling
politician
might
have
a
full
of
documentary
evidence
about
party
bosses
and
power
deals
and
chorus
girls
and
martian
tekkyl
coats
but
the
man
we
after
very
definitely
would
not
you
telling
me
this
point
was
such
a
sore
one
that
samms
relapsed
into
idiom
the
boys
should
have
cracked
that
box
a
week
ago
but
they
struck
a
knot
i
see
if
they
know
anything
yet
tune
in
rod
ray
he
lensed
a
thought
at
his
cousin
yes
virge
have
you
got
a
into
that
yet
glad
you
called
yes
last
night
empty
empty
as
a
skull
except
for
an
gimmick
that
it
took
whole
laboratory
almost
a
week
to
neutralize
i
see
thanks
off
samms
turned
to
kinnison
well
nice
a
mighty
smart
operator
kinnison
gave
credit
ungrudgingly
now
i
buy
your
picture
what
a
man
but
now
and
i
got
my
ears
pinned
back
what
was
it
you
started
to
say
about
pirates
just
that
we
have
very
little
to
go
on
except
for
the
kind
of
stuff
they
seem
to
like
best
and
the
fact
that
even
armed
escorts
have
not
been
able
to
protect
certain
types
of
shipments
of
late
the
escorts
too
have
disappeared
but
with
these
facts
as
bases
it
seems
to
me
that
we
could
arrange
something
perhaps
like
this
a
fast
sleek
freighter
and
a
heavy
bored
steadily
through
the
void
the
merchantman
carried
a
fabulously
valuable
cargo
not
bullion
or
jewels
or
plate
of
price
but
things
literally
above
price
machine
tools
of
highest
precision
delicate
optical
and
electrical
instruments
fine
watches
and
chronometers
she
also
carried
first
lensman
virgil
samms
and
aboard
the
there
was
roderick
kinnison
for
the
first
time
in
history
a
mere
bore
a
port
admiral
flag
as
far
as
the
detectors
of
those
two
ships
could
reach
space
was
empty
of
craft
but
the
two
lensmen
knew
that
they
were
not
alone
one
and
detets
away
loafing
along
at
the
speed
and
paralleling
her
course
in
a
hemispherical
formation
open
to
the
front
there
flew
six
tremendous
of
whose
existence
no
tellurian
or
colonial
government
had
even
an
inkling
they
were
the
fastest
and
deadliest
craft
yet
built
by
man
the
first
fruits
of
operation
bennett
and
they
too
carried
lensmen
costigan
jack
kinnison
northrop
dronvire
of
rigel
four
rodebush
and
cleveland
nor
was
there
need
of
detectors
the
eight
lensmen
were
in
as
close
communication
as
though
they
had
been
standing
in
the
same
room
on
your
toes
men
came
samms
quiet
thought
we
are
about
to
pass
within
a
few
of
an
uninhabited
solar
system
no
planets
at
all
this
may
be
it
tune
to
kinnison
on
one
side
and
to
your
captains
on
the
other
take
over
rod
at
one
instant
the
ether
for
one
full
detet
in
every
direction
was
empty
in
the
next
three
intensely
brilliant
spots
of
detection
flashed
into
being
in
line
with
the
dead
planet
so
invitingly
close
at
hand
this
development
came
as
a
surprise
since
only
two
raiders
had
been
expected
a
battleship
to
take
care
of
the
escort
a
cruiser
to
take
the
merchantman
the
fact
that
the
pirates
had
become
cautious
or
suspicious
and
had
sent
three
on
the
mission
however
did
not
operate
to
change
the
patrol
strategy
for
samms
had
concluded
and
dronvire
and
bergenholm
and
rularion
of
jupiter
had
agreed
that
the
real
commander
of
the
expedition
would
be
aboard
the
vessel
that
attacked
the
freighter
in
the
next
instant
then
each
lensman
saw
what
roderick
kinnison
saw
in
the
very
instant
of
his
seeing
it
six
more
points
of
hard
white
light
sprang
into
being
upon
the
plates
of
guileful
freighter
and
decoying
cruiser
jack
and
mase
take
the
leader
kinnison
snapped
out
the
thought
dronvire
and
costigan
right
wing
he
the
one
that
going
after
the
freighter
fred
and
lyman
left
wing
hipe
the
pirate
ships
flashed
up
filling
ether
and
alike
with
a
solid
mush
of
interference
through
which
no
call
for
help
could
be
driven
two
against
the
cruiser
one
against
the
freighter
the
former
of
course
had
been
expected
to
offer
more
than
a
token
resistance
battle
cruisers
of
the
patrol
were
powerful
vessels
both
on
offense
and
defense
and
it
was
a
known
and
recognized
fact
that
the
men
of
the
patrol
were
the
pirate
commander
who
attacked
the
freighter
however
was
a
surprised
pirate
indeed
his
first
beam
directed
well
forward
well
ahead
of
the
precious
cargo
should
have
wrought
the
same
havoc
against
screens
and
and
structure
as
a
poker
would
against
a
pat
of
butter
practically
the
whole
including
the
control
room
should
have
whiffed
outward
into
space
in
gobbets
and
streamers
of
molten
and
gaseous
metal
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
this
merchantman
was
no
ordinary
screens
protected
that
particular
freighter
and
the
person
of
first
lensman
samms
roderick
kinnison
had
very
thoroughly
seen
to
that
in
sheer
mass
her
screen
generators
her
entire
cargo
heavy
as
that
cargo
was
by
more
than
two
to
one
thus
the
beams
stormed
and
struck
and
clawed
and
clung
uselessly
they
did
not
penetrate
and
as
the
surprised
attacker
shoved
his
power
up
and
up
to
his
absolute
ceiling
of
effort
the
only
result
was
to
increase
the
already
tremendous
pyrotechnic
display
of
energies
cascading
in
all
directions
from
the
fiercely
radiant
defenses
of
the
tellurian
freighter
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
commanding
officers
of
the
other
two
attacking
battleships
were
also
surprised
the
screens
did
not
go
down
even
under
the
combined
top
effort
of
two
and
she
did
not
have
a
beam
hot
enough
to
light
a
match
she
must
be
but
before
the
startled
outlaws
could
do
anything
about
the
realization
that
they
instead
of
being
the
trappers
were
in
cold
fact
the
trapped
all
three
of
them
were
surprised
again
the
last
surprise
that
any
of
them
was
ever
to
receive
six
mighty
vastly
bigger
faster
more
powerful
than
their
own
were
rushing
upon
them
blanketing
all
channels
of
communication
as
efficiently
and
as
enthusiastically
as
they
themselves
had
been
doing
an
instant
before
being
out
simply
and
ruthlessly
to
kill
and
not
to
capture
four
of
the
newcomers
from
bennett
polished
off
the
cruiser
two
attackers
in
very
short
order
they
simply
flashed
in
went
inert
at
the
four
corners
of
an
imaginary
tetrahedron
and
threw
everything
they
had
and
they
had
plenty
possibly
just
barely
possibly
there
may
have
been
somewhere
a
shorter
than
that
one
but
there
certainly
was
never
one
more
violent
then
the
four
set
out
after
their
two
and
the
one
remaining
pirate
who
was
frantically
devoting
his
every
effort
to
the
avoidance
of
engagement
but
with
six
ships
each
one
of
which
was
of
vastly
greater
individual
power
than
his
own
at
the
six
corners
of
an
octahedron
of
which
he
was
the
geometrical
center
his
ability
to
cut
tractor
beams
and
to
squirt
out
from
between
two
opposed
pressors
did
him
no
good
whatever
he
was
englobed
or
rather
to
apply
the
correct
terminology
to
an
operation
involving
so
few
units
he
was
boxed
to
blow
the
one
remaining
raider
out
of
the
ether
would
have
been
easy
enough
but
that
was
exactly
what
the
patrolmen
did
not
want
to
do
they
wanted
information
wherefore
each
of
the
patrol
ships
directed
a
dozen
or
so
beams
upon
the
scintillating
protective
screens
of
the
enemy
enough
so
that
every
square
yard
of
defensive
web
was
under
direct
attack
as
rapidly
as
it
could
be
done
without
losing
equilibrium
or
synchronization
the
power
of
each
beam
was
stepped
up
until
the
wildly
violet
incandescence
of
the
pirate
screen
showed
that
it
was
hovering
on
the
very
edge
of
failure
then
in
the
instant
went
furiously
to
work
the
screen
was
already
loaded
to
its
limit
no
transfer
of
defensive
energy
was
possible
thus
tremendously
overloaded
locally
locally
it
flared
through
the
into
the
black
and
went
down
and
the
fiercely
penetrant
daggers
of
pure
force
stabbed
and
stabbed
and
stabbed
the
engine
room
went
first
even
though
the
needlers
had
to
gnaw
a
hole
straight
through
the
pirate
craft
in
order
to
find
the
vital
installations
then
enough
damage
done
so
that
could
get
in
the
rest
of
the
work
was
done
with
precision
and
dispatch
in
a
matter
of
seconds
the
pirate
hulk
lay
helpless
and
the
patrolmen
peeled
her
like
an
orange
or
rather
more
like
an
amateur
cook
very
wastefully
peeling
a
potato
resistless
knives
of
energy
sheared
off
and
top
and
bottom
port
and
starboard
sides
then
slabbed
off
the
corners
of
what
was
left
until
the
control
room
was
almost
bared
to
space
then
as
soon
as
the
intrinsic
velocities
could
possibly
be
matched
board
and
storm
with
dronvire
of
rigel
four
in
the
lead
closely
followed
by
costigan
northrop
kinnison
the
younger
and
a
platoon
of
armed
and
armored
space
marines
samms
and
the
two
scientists
did
not
belong
in
such
a
melee
as
that
which
was
to
come
and
knew
it
kinnison
the
elder
did
not
belong
either
but
did
not
know
it
in
fact
he
cursed
fluently
and
bitterly
at
having
to
stay
out
nevertheless
out
he
stayed
dronvire
on
the
other
hand
did
not
like
to
fight
the
very
thought
of
actual
bodily
combat
revolted
every
fiber
of
his
being
in
view
of
what
the
men
were
reporting
however
and
of
what
all
the
lensmen
knew
of
pirate
psychology
dronvire
had
to
get
into
that
control
room
first
and
he
had
to
get
there
and
if
he
to
fight
he
could
and
physically
he
was
wonderfully
well
equipped
for
just
such
activity
to
his
immense
physical
strength
the
natural
concomitant
of
a
force
of
gravity
more
than
twice
earth
the
armor
which
so
encumbered
the
tellurian
battlers
was
a
scarcely
noticeable
impediment
his
sense
of
perception
which
could
not
be
barred
by
any
material
substance
kept
him
fully
informed
of
every
development
in
his
neighborhood
his
literally
incredible
speed
enabled
him
not
merely
to
parry
a
blow
aimed
at
him
but
to
bash
out
the
brains
of
the
attacker
before
that
blow
could
be
more
than
started
and
whereas
a
human
being
can
swing
only
one
or
fire
only
two
at
a
time
the
rigellian
plunged
through
space
toward
what
was
left
of
the
pirate
vessel
swinging
not
one
or
two
but
four
each
held
in
a
lithe
and
supple
but
immensely
strong
tentacular
hand
why
axes
why
not
lewistons
or
rifles
or
pistols
because
the
space
armor
of
that
day
could
withstand
almost
indefinitely
the
output
of
two
or
three
projectors
because
the
resistance
of
its
defensive
fields
varied
directly
as
the
cube
of
the
velocity
of
any
material
projectile
encountering
them
thus
and
strangely
enough
the
advance
of
science
had
forced
the
of
that
weapon
most
of
the
pirates
had
died
of
course
during
the
dismemberment
of
their
ship
many
more
had
been
picked
off
by
the
gunners
in
the
control
room
however
there
was
a
platoon
of
elite
guards
clustered
so
closely
about
the
commander
and
his
officers
that
needles
could
not
be
used
a
group
that
would
have
to
be
wiped
out
by
hand
if
the
attack
had
come
by
way
of
the
only
doorway
so
that
the
pirates
could
have
concentrated
their
weapons
upon
one
or
two
patrolmen
the
commander
might
have
had
time
enough
to
do
what
he
was
under
compulsion
to
do
but
while
the
patrolmen
were
still
in
space
a
plane
of
force
sheared
off
the
entire
side
of
the
room
a
tractor
beam
jerked
the
detached
wall
away
and
the
attackers
floated
in
en
masse
weightless
combat
is
not
at
all
like
any
form
of
gymnastics
known
to
us
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
master
and
in
times
of
stress
the
muscles
revert
involuntarily
and
embarrassingly
to
their
wonted
techniques
thus
the
endeavors
of
most
of
the
battlers
upon
both
sides
while
earnest
enough
and
deadly
enough
of
intent
were
almost
comically
unproductive
of
result
in
a
matter
of
seconds
figures
were
floating
from
wall
to
ceiling
to
wall
to
floor
striking
wildly
darting
backward
from
the
violence
of
their
own
fierce
swings
the
tellurian
lensmen
however
had
had
more
practice
and
remembered
their
lessons
better
jack
kinnison
soaring
into
the
room
grabbed
the
first
solid
thing
he
could
reach
a
post
pulling
himself
down
to
the
floor
he
braced
both
feet
sighted
past
the
nearest
foeman
swung
his
axe
and
gave
a
tremendous
shove
such
was
his
timing
that
in
the
instant
of
maximum
effort
the
beak
of
his
atrociously
effective
weapon
encountered
the
pirate
helmet
and
that
was
that
he
wrenched
his
axe
free
and
shoved
the
corpse
away
in
such
a
direction
that
the
reaction
would
send
him
against
a
wall
at
the
floor
line
in
position
to
repeat
the
maneuver
since
mason
northrop
was
heavier
and
stronger
than
his
friend
his
technique
was
markedly
different
he
dove
for
the
which
of
course
was
welded
to
the
floor
he
hooked
one
foot
around
one
of
the
table
legs
and
braced
the
other
against
its
top
weightless
but
inert
it
made
no
difference
whether
his
position
was
vertical
or
horizontal
or
anywhere
between
from
this
point
of
vantage
with
his
length
of
body
and
arm
and
axe
he
could
cover
a
lot
of
room
he
reached
out
hooked
bill
of
axe
into
belt
or
or
angle
of
armor
and
pulled
and
as
the
helplessly
raging
pirate
floated
past
him
he
swung
and
struck
and
that
too
was
that
dronvire
of
rigel
four
did
not
rush
to
the
attack
he
had
never
been
and
was
not
now
either
excited
or
angry
indeed
it
was
only
empirically
that
he
knew
what
anger
and
excitement
were
he
had
never
been
in
any
kind
of
a
fight
therefore
he
paused
for
a
couple
of
seconds
to
analyze
the
situation
and
to
determine
his
own
most
efficient
method
of
operation
he
would
not
have
to
be
in
physical
contact
with
the
pirate
captain
to
go
to
work
on
his
mind
but
he
would
have
to
be
closer
than
this
and
he
would
have
to
be
free
from
physical
attack
while
he
concentrated
he
perceived
what
kinnison
and
costigan
and
northrop
were
doing
and
knew
why
each
was
working
in
a
different
fashion
he
applied
that
knowledge
to
his
own
mass
to
his
own
musculature
to
the
length
and
strength
of
his
arms
each
one
of
which
was
twice
as
long
and
ten
times
as
strong
as
the
trunk
of
an
elephant
he
computed
forces
and
leverages
actions
and
reactions
points
of
application
stresses
and
strains
he
threw
away
two
of
his
axes
the
two
empty
arms
reached
out
each
curling
around
the
neck
of
a
pirate
two
axes
flashed
grazing
each
pinioning
arm
so
nearly
that
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
sharp
edges
did
not
shear
away
the
rigellian
own
armor
two
heads
floated
away
from
two
bodies
and
dronvire
reached
for
two
more
and
two
and
two
and
two
calm
and
dispassionate
but
not
wasting
a
motion
or
a
millisecond
dronvire
accomplished
more
in
less
time
than
all
the
tellurians
in
the
room
costigan
northrop
kinnison
attend
he
launched
a
thought
i
have
no
time
to
kill
more
of
them
the
commander
is
dying
of
a
wound
and
i
have
important
work
to
do
see
to
it
please
that
these
remaining
creatures
do
not
attack
me
while
i
am
doing
it
dronvire
tuned
his
mind
to
that
of
the
pirate
and
probed
although
dying
the
pirate
captain
offered
fierce
resistance
but
the
rigellian
was
not
alone
attuned
to
his
mind
working
smoothly
with
it
giving
it
strengths
and
qualities
which
no
rigellian
ever
had
had
or
ever
would
have
were
the
two
strongest
minds
of
earth
that
of
rod
the
rock
kinnison
with
the
driving
force
the
indomitable
will
the
transcendent
urge
of
all
human
heredity
and
that
of
virgil
samms
with
all
that
had
made
him
first
lensman
tell
that
terrific
triple
mind
demanded
with
a
force
which
simply
could
not
be
denied
where
are
you
from
resistance
is
useless
yours
or
that
of
those
whom
you
serve
your
bases
and
powers
are
smaller
and
weaker
than
ours
since
spaceways
is
only
a
corporation
and
we
are
the
galactic
patrol
tell
who
are
your
bosses
tell
tell
under
that
irresistible
urge
there
appeared
foggily
and
without
any
hint
of
knowledge
of
name
or
of
spatial
an
embattled
planet
very
similar
in
a
smaller
way
to
the
patrol
own
bennett
and
even
more
foggily
but
still
not
so
blurred
but
that
their
features
were
unmistakeably
recognizable
the
images
of
two
men
that
of
murgatroyd
the
pirate
chief
completely
strange
to
both
kinnison
and
samms
and
back
of
murgatroyd
and
above
him
that
of
big
jim
towne
chapter
first
about
murgatroyd
in
his
office
in
the
hill
roderick
kinnison
spoke
aloud
to
the
first
lensman
what
do
you
think
should
be
done
about
him
murgatroyd
hm
m
samms
inhaled
a
mouthful
of
smoke
and
exhaled
it
slowly
watched
it
dissipate
in
the
air
ah
yes
murgatroyd
he
repeated
the
performance
my
thought
at
the
moment
is
to
let
him
alone
check
kinnison
said
if
samms
was
surprised
at
his
concurrence
he
did
not
show
it
why
let
see
if
we
check
on
that
because
he
does
not
seem
to
be
of
fundamental
importance
even
if
we
could
find
him
and
by
the
way
what
do
you
think
the
chance
is
of
our
spies
finding
him
just
about
the
same
chance
that
theirs
have
of
finding
out
about
the
switch
or
our
planet
bennett
vanishingly
small
zero
right
and
even
if
we
could
find
him
even
find
their
secret
base
which
is
certainly
as
well
hidden
as
ours
is
it
would
do
us
no
present
good
because
we
could
take
no
positive
action
we
have
i
think
learned
the
prime
fact
that
towne
is
actually
murgatroyd
superior
that
the
way
i
see
it
we
can
almost
draw
an
organization
chart
now
i
would
say
samms
smiled
there
are
gaping
holes
and
isaacson
is
as
yet
a
highly
unknown
quantity
i
tried
to
draw
one
a
dozen
times
but
we
have
got
enough
information
an
incorrect
chart
you
know
would
be
worse
than
none
at
all
as
soon
as
i
can
draw
a
correct
one
i
show
it
to
you
but
in
the
meantime
the
position
of
our
friend
james
towne
is
now
clear
he
is
actually
a
big
shot
in
both
piracy
and
politics
that
fact
surprised
me
even
though
it
did
clarify
the
picture
tremendously
me
too
one
good
thing
we
wo
have
to
hunt
for
him
you
been
working
on
him
right
along
though
have
you
yes
but
this
new
relationship
throws
light
on
a
good
many
details
which
have
been
obscure
it
also
tends
to
strengthen
our
working
hypothesis
as
to
isaacson
which
we
ca
prove
yet
of
course
that
he
is
the
actual
working
head
of
the
drug
syndicate
in
charge
of
drugs
so
to
speak
huh
that
a
new
one
on
me
i
do
see
it
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
at
the
top
there
is
morgan
he
is
and
has
been
for
some
time
the
real
boss
of
north
america
under
him
probably
taking
orders
direct
is
president
witherspoon
undoubtedly
the
nationalist
party
is
strictly
machine
and
witherspoon
is
one
of
the
world
slimiest
skinkers
morgan
is
chief
engineer
of
the
machine
take
it
from
there
we
know
that
boss
jim
is
also
in
the
top
echelon
quite
possibly
the
of
the
enemy
armed
forces
by
analogy
and
since
isaacson
is
apparently
on
the
same
level
as
towne
immediately
below
morgan
would
there
be
three
witherspoon
i
doubt
it
my
present
idea
is
that
witherspoon
is
at
least
one
level
lower
comparatively
small
fry
could
be
i
buy
it
a
nice
picture
virge
and
beautifully
symmetrical
his
mightiness
morgan
secretary
of
war
towne
and
secretary
of
drugs
isaacson
and
each
of
them
putting
a
heavy
shoulder
behind
the
political
bandwagon
nice
that
makes
operation
mateese
tougher
than
ever
a
toughie
glad
i
told
you
it
was
my
dish
saves
me
the
trouble
of
backing
out
now
yes
i
have
noticed
how
prone
you
are
to
duck
tough
jobs
samms
smiled
quietly
however
unless
i
am
even
more
mistaken
than
usual
you
will
be
in
it
up
to
your
ears
my
friend
before
it
is
over
huh
how
kinnison
demanded
that
will
i
hope
become
clear
very
shortly
samms
stubbed
out
the
butt
of
his
cigarette
and
lit
another
the
basic
problem
can
be
stated
very
simply
how
are
we
going
to
persuade
the
sovereign
countries
of
earth
particularly
the
north
american
continent
to
grant
the
galactic
patrol
the
tremendous
power
and
authority
it
will
have
to
have
nice
phrasing
virge
and
studied
not
off
the
cuff
but
are
you
a
bit
little
if
any
conflict
the
patrol
would
be
pretty
largely
in
scope
with
of
course
the
necessary
and
and
um
m
exactly
but
it
logical
enough
virge
even
at
that
and
has
plenty
of
precedents
clear
back
to
ancient
history
back
before
when
they
first
started
to
use
atomic
energy
and
the
only
drugs
they
had
to
worry
about
were
cocaine
morphine
heroin
and
other
purely
tellurian
products
i
was
reading
about
it
just
the
other
day
kinnison
swung
around
fingered
a
book
out
of
a
matched
set
and
riffled
its
leaves
russia
was
the
world
problem
child
then
put
up
what
they
called
an
iron
curtain
would
play
with
the
children
but
picked
up
her
marbles
and
went
home
but
yet
here
it
is
original
source
unknown
some
indications
point
to
a
report
of
somebody
named
hoover
sometime
in
the
nineteen
forties
or
fifties
gregorian
calendar
listen
protocol
he
talking
about
the
agreement
on
narcotics
control
signed
by
nations
including
the
that
was
russia
its
satellite
states
it
was
the
only
international
agreement
to
which
the
communist
countries
you
know
more
about
what
communism
was
i
suppose
than
i
do
just
that
it
was
another
form
of
dictatorship
that
did
work
out
to
which
the
communist
countries
ever
gave
more
than
lip
service
this
adherence
is
all
the
more
surprising
in
view
of
the
political
situation
then
obtaining
in
that
all
signatory
nations
obligated
themselves
to
surrender
national
sovereignty
in
five
highly
significant
respects
as
follows
to
permit
narcotics
agents
of
all
other
signatory
nations
free
secret
and
unregistered
entry
into
unrestricted
travel
throughout
and
exit
from
all
their
lands
and
waters
wherever
situate
upon
request
to
allow
known
criminals
and
known
contraband
to
enter
and
to
leave
their
territories
without
interference
to
cooperate
fully
and
as
a
secondary
and
not
as
a
prime
mover
in
any
narcotics
patrol
program
set
up
by
any
other
signatory
nation
upon
request
to
maintain
complete
secrecy
concerning
any
narcotics
operation
and
to
keep
the
central
narcotics
authority
fully
and
continuously
informed
upon
all
matters
hereinbefore
specified
and
apparently
virge
it
worked
if
they
could
do
that
back
then
we
certainly
should
be
able
to
make
the
patrol
work
now
you
talk
as
though
the
situations
were
comparable
they
are
instead
of
giving
up
an
insignificant
fraction
of
their
national
sovereignty
all
nations
will
have
to
give
up
practically
all
of
it
they
will
have
to
change
their
thinking
from
a
national
to
a
galactic
viewpoint
will
have
to
become
units
in
a
galactic
civilization
just
as
counties
used
to
be
units
of
states
and
states
are
units
of
the
continents
the
galactic
patrol
will
not
be
able
to
stop
at
being
the
supreme
and
only
authority
in
affairs
it
is
bound
to
become
and
eventually
it
must
and
it
shall
be
the
authority
except
for
such
purely
local
organizations
as
city
police
a
program
kinnison
thought
silently
for
minutes
but
still
betting
that
you
can
bring
it
off
we
keep
on
driving
until
we
do
what
gives
us
our
chance
is
that
the
solarian
council
is
already
in
existence
and
is
functioning
smoothly
and
that
the
government
of
north
america
has
no
jurisdiction
beyond
the
boundaries
of
its
continent
thus
and
even
though
morgan
has
powers
both
as
boss
of
north
america
and
as
the
head
of
an
organization
which
is
in
fact
in
scope
he
can
do
nothing
whatever
about
the
fact
that
the
solarian
council
has
been
enlarged
into
the
galactic
council
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
and
is
very
much
in
favor
of
that
particular
move
just
as
much
so
as
we
are
you
going
too
fast
for
me
how
do
you
figure
that
unlike
our
idea
of
the
patrol
as
a
coordinator
of
free
and
independent
races
morgan
sees
it
as
the
perfect
instrument
of
a
galactic
dictatorship
thus
north
america
is
the
most
powerful
continent
of
earth
the
other
continents
will
follow
her
lead
or
else
tellus
can
very
easily
dominate
the
other
solarian
planets
and
the
solar
system
can
maintain
dominance
over
all
other
systems
as
they
are
discovered
and
colonized
therefore
whoever
controls
the
north
american
continent
controls
all
space
i
see
could
be
at
that
throw
the
lensmen
out
put
his
own
stooges
in
wonder
how
he
go
about
it
a
de
no
the
next
election
would
be
my
guess
if
so
that
will
be
the
most
important
election
in
history
if
they
decide
to
wait
for
the
election
yes
i
not
as
sure
as
you
seem
to
be
that
they
will
not
act
sooner
they
ca
kinnison
declared
name
me
one
thing
they
think
they
can
do
and
i
shoot
it
fuller
of
holes
than
a
target
they
can
and
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
they
will
samms
replied
soberly
at
any
time
he
cares
to
do
so
morgan
through
the
north
american
government
of
course
can
abrogate
the
treaty
and
name
his
own
council
without
my
boys
the
backbone
and
the
guts
of
north
america
as
well
as
of
the
patrol
do
be
stupid
virge
they
admitted
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
being
paid
in
north
american
currency
of
course
we
will
soon
have
our
own
galactic
credit
system
worked
out
but
what
the
hell
difference
would
make
kinnison
wanted
savagely
to
know
you
think
they
last
until
the
next
if
they
start
playing
that
kind
of
ball
what
in
hell
do
you
think
be
doing
and
clayton
and
schweikert
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
sitting
on
our
fat
rumps
and
crying
into
our
beers
you
would
do
nothing
i
could
not
permit
any
illegal
permit
kinnison
blazed
leaping
to
his
feet
permit
hell
are
you
enough
to
actually
think
i
would
ask
or
need
your
permission
listen
samms
the
port
admiral
voice
took
on
a
quality
like
nothing
his
friend
had
ever
before
heard
the
first
thing
i
would
do
would
be
to
take
off
your
lens
wrap
you
up
especially
your
mouth
in
seventeen
yards
of
adhesive
tape
and
heave
you
into
the
brig
the
second
would
be
to
call
out
everything
we
got
including
every
ship
on
bennett
able
to
fly
and
declare
martial
law
the
third
would
be
a
series
of
summary
executions
starting
with
morgan
and
working
down
and
if
he
got
any
fraction
of
the
brain
i
credit
him
with
morgan
knows
damned
well
what
would
happen
oh
samms
while
very
much
taken
aback
was
thrilled
to
the
center
of
his
being
i
had
not
considered
anything
so
drastic
but
you
probably
would
not
kinnison
corrected
him
grimly
and
morgan
does
know
except
about
bennett
of
course
and
he
would
not
for
obvious
reasons
bring
in
his
secret
armed
forces
you
right
rod
it
will
be
the
election
definitely
and
it
plain
enough
what
their
basic
strategy
will
be
kinnison
completely
mollified
sat
down
and
lit
another
cigar
his
nationalist
party
is
now
in
power
but
it
was
our
cosmocrats
of
the
previous
administration
who
so
basely
slipped
one
over
on
the
dear
who
betrayed
the
entire
north
american
continent
into
the
claws
of
rapacious
wealth
no
less
by
ratifying
that
unlawful
unhallowed
unconstitutional
and
so
on
treaty
scoundrels
betrayers
of
a
sacred
trust
morgan
will
thump
the
tub
on
that
theme
he
make
the
welkin
ring
as
it
never
rang
before
kinnison
mimicked
savagely
the
demagogue
round
and
purple
tones
as
he
went
on
they
had
no
mandate
from
the
to
trade
their
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
that
nefarious
and
underhanded
treaty
is
prima
and
and
completely
and
necessarily
and
positively
null
and
void
people
of
earth
arouse
arise
rise
in
your
might
and
throw
off
this
stultifying
and
degrading
this
paralyzing
yoke
of
the
monied
powers
throw
out
this
dictatorial
autocratic
illegal
monstrous
council
of
lensmen
rise
in
your
might
at
the
polls
elect
a
council
of
your
own
choosing
not
of
lensmen
but
of
ordinary
folks
like
you
and
me
throw
this
hellish
yoke
i
say
and
here
he
begins
to
positively
froth
at
the
mouth
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
he
has
used
that
exact
peroration
ancient
as
it
is
so
many
times
that
practically
everybody
thinks
he
originated
it
and
it
always
good
for
so
many
decibels
of
applause
that
he
keep
on
using
it
forever
your
analysis
is
vivid
cogent
and
factual
rod
but
the
situation
is
not
at
all
funny
did
i
act
as
though
i
thought
it
was
if
so
i
a
damned
poor
actor
i
like
to
kick
the
bloodsucking
leech
all
the
way
from
here
to
the
great
nebula
in
andromeda
and
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
i
going
to
an
interesting
but
somewhat
irrelevant
idea
samms
smiled
at
his
friend
passionate
outburst
but
go
on
i
agree
with
you
in
principle
so
far
and
your
viewpoint
is
to
say
the
least
refreshing
well
morgan
will
have
so
hypnotized
most
of
the
dear
that
they
will
think
it
their
own
idea
when
he
this
spineless
nincompoop
witherspoon
for
another
term
as
president
of
north
america
with
a
solid
slate
of
behind
him
they
win
the
election
then
the
government
of
the
north
american
continent
not
the
machine
but
all
nice
and
legal
and
by
mandate
and
in
strict
accordance
with
the
party
platform
abrogates
the
treaty
and
names
its
own
council
and
right
then
my
friend
the
boys
and
i
will
do
our
stuff
except
that
in
such
a
case
you
would
think
it
over
rod
why
not
kinnison
demanded
in
a
voice
which
however
did
not
carry
much
conviction
because
we
would
be
in
the
wrong
and
we
are
even
less
able
to
go
against
united
public
opinion
than
is
the
morgan
crowd
we
do
i
got
it
kinnison
banged
the
desk
with
his
fist
that
would
be
a
strictly
unilateral
action
north
america
would
be
standing
alone
of
course
so
we
pull
all
the
cosmocrats
and
all
of
our
friends
out
of
north
america
move
them
to
bennett
or
somewhere
and
make
morgan
and
company
a
present
of
it
we
wo
declare
martial
law
or
kill
anybody
unless
they
decide
to
call
in
their
reserves
we
merely
isolate
the
whole
damned
continent
throw
a
screen
around
it
and
over
it
that
a
microbe
wo
be
able
to
get
through
one
that
would
make
that
iron
curtain
i
read
about
look
like
a
bride
veil
and
we
them
isolated
until
they
beg
to
join
up
on
our
terms
strictly
legal
and
the
perfect
solution
how
about
me
giving
the
boys
a
briefing
on
it
right
now
not
yet
samms
mien
however
lightened
markedly
i
never
thought
of
that
way
out
it
be
done
and
it
would
probably
work
but
i
would
not
recommend
it
except
as
an
ultimately
last
resort
it
has
at
least
two
tremendous
drawbacks
i
know
it
but
it
would
wreck
north
america
as
no
nation
has
ever
been
wrecked
quite
possibly
beyond
recovery
furthermore
how
many
people
including
yourself
and
your
children
would
like
to
renounce
their
north
american
citizenship
and
remove
themselves
permanently
and
irrevocably
from
north
american
soil
um
m
put
that
away
it
does
sound
so
good
does
it
but
what
the
hell
else
can
we
do
just
what
we
have
been
planning
on
doing
we
must
win
the
election
huh
kinnison
mouth
almost
fell
open
you
say
it
easy
how
with
whom
by
what
stretch
of
the
imagination
do
you
figure
that
you
can
find
anybody
with
a
loose
enough
mouth
to
and
morgan
and
can
you
duplicate
his
machine
we
can
not
only
duplicate
his
machine
we
can
better
it
the
truth
presented
to
the
people
in
language
they
can
understand
and
appreciate
by
a
man
whom
they
like
admire
and
respect
will
be
more
attractive
than
morgan
promises
the
same
truth
will
dispose
of
morgan
lies
well
go
on
you
answered
my
questions
after
a
fashion
except
the
stinger
does
the
council
think
it
got
a
man
with
enough
dynage
to
lift
the
load
unanimously
they
also
agreed
unanimously
that
we
have
only
one
have
you
any
idea
who
he
is
not
a
glimmering
of
one
kinnison
frowned
in
thought
then
his
face
cleared
into
a
broad
grin
and
he
yelled
a
damn
fool
i
am
of
course
wrong
i
was
not
even
seriously
considered
it
was
the
concensus
that
i
could
not
possibly
win
my
work
has
been
such
as
to
keep
me
out
of
the
public
eye
if
the
man
in
the
street
thinks
of
me
at
all
he
thinks
that
i
hold
myself
apart
and
above
him
the
ivory
tower
concept
could
be
at
that
but
you
got
my
curiosity
aroused
how
can
a
man
of
that
caliber
have
been
kicking
around
so
long
without
me
knowing
anything
about
him
you
do
that
what
i
been
working
around
to
all
afternoon
you
huh
kinnison
gasped
as
though
he
had
received
a
blow
in
the
solar
plexus
me
me
hell
brazen
hinges
exactly
you
silencing
kinnison
inarticulate
protests
samms
went
on
first
you
have
no
difficulty
in
talking
to
an
audience
as
you
just
talked
to
me
of
course
not
but
did
i
use
any
language
that
would
burn
out
the
transmitters
i
do
remember
whether
i
did
or
not
i
do
either
you
probably
did
but
that
would
be
nothing
new
telenews
has
never
yet
cut
you
off
the
ether
because
of
it
the
point
is
this
while
you
do
not
realize
it
you
are
a
better
and
than
morgan
is
when
something
such
as
just
now
really
gets
you
going
and
as
for
a
machine
what
finer
one
is
possible
than
the
patrol
everybody
in
it
or
connected
with
it
will
support
you
to
the
hilt
you
know
that
why
i
i
suppose
so
probably
they
would
yes
do
you
know
why
ca
say
that
i
do
unless
it
because
i
treat
them
fair
so
they
do
the
same
to
me
exactly
i
do
say
that
everybody
likes
you
but
i
do
know
of
anybody
who
does
respect
you
and
most
important
everybody
all
over
space
knows
the
rock
kinnison
and
why
he
is
called
that
but
that
very
on
horseback
thing
may
backfire
on
you
virge
perhaps
slightly
but
we
not
afraid
of
that
and
finally
you
said
you
like
to
kick
morgan
from
here
to
andromeda
how
would
you
like
to
kick
him
from
panama
city
to
the
north
pole
i
said
it
and
i
was
just
warming
up
my
jets
either
i
like
it
the
big
lensman
nostrils
flared
his
lips
thinned
by
god
virge
i
will
thanks
rod
with
no
display
whatever
of
the
emotion
he
felt
samms
skipped
deliberately
to
the
matter
next
in
hand
now
about
eridan
let
see
if
they
know
anything
yet
the
report
of
knobos
and
dalnalten
was
terse
and
exact
they
had
found
and
that
finding
so
baldly
put
could
have
filled
and
should
fill
a
book
that
spaceways
uranium
vessels
were
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
hauling
thionite
from
eridan
to
the
planets
of
sol
being
useless
they
had
considered
the
advisability
of
investigating
eridan
in
person
but
had
decided
against
such
action
eridan
was
closely
held
by
uranium
incorporated
its
population
was
one
hundred
percent
tellurian
human
neither
dalnalten
nor
knobos
could
disguise
himself
well
enough
to
work
there
either
would
be
caught
promptly
and
as
promptly
shot
thanks
fellows
samms
said
when
it
became
evident
that
the
brief
report
was
done
then
to
kinnison
that
puts
it
up
to
conway
costigan
and
jack
or
mase
or
both
both
kinnison
decided
and
anybody
else
they
can
use
i
get
them
at
it
samms
sent
out
thoughts
and
now
i
wonder
what
that
daughter
of
mine
is
doing
i
a
little
worried
about
her
rod
she
too
cocky
for
her
own
good
or
strength
some
of
these
days
going
to
bite
off
more
than
she
can
chew
if
she
has
already
the
more
we
learn
about
morgan
the
less
i
like
the
idea
of
her
working
on
herkimer
herkimer
third
i
told
her
so
a
dozen
times
and
why
but
of
course
it
did
do
any
good
it
would
the
only
way
to
develop
teeth
is
to
bite
with
you
had
to
so
did
i
our
kids
have
got
to
too
we
lived
through
it
so
will
they
as
for
herky
the
third
he
thought
for
moments
then
went
on
check
but
she
done
a
job
so
far
that
nobody
else
could
do
in
spite
of
that
fact
if
it
was
for
our
lenses
i
say
to
pull
her
if
you
have
to
heave
the
insubordinate
young
jade
into
the
brig
but
with
the
lenses
and
the
way
you
watch
her
to
say
nothing
of
mase
northrop
and
he
a
lot
of
man
i
ca
see
her
getting
in
either
very
bad
or
very
deep
can
you
no
i
ca
samms
admitted
but
the
thoughtful
frown
did
not
leave
his
face
he
lensed
her
finding
as
he
had
supposed
that
she
was
at
a
party
dancing
as
he
had
feared
with
senator
morgan
number
one
secretary
hi
dad
she
greeted
him
gaily
with
no
slightest
change
in
the
expression
of
the
face
turned
so
engagingly
to
her
partner
i
have
the
honor
of
reporting
that
all
instruments
are
still
the
green
and
have
you
by
any
chance
been
paying
any
attention
to
what
i
have
been
telling
you
oh
lots
she
assured
him
i
collected
reams
of
data
he
could
be
almost
as
much
of
a
menace
as
he
thinks
he
is
in
some
cases
but
i
have
begun
to
slip
yet
as
i
have
told
you
all
along
this
is
just
a
game
and
we
both
playing
it
strictly
according
to
the
rules
that
good
keep
it
that
way
my
dear
samms
signed
off
and
his
daughter
returned
her
full
attention
never
noticeably
absent
to
the
handsome
secretary
the
evening
wore
on
miss
samms
danced
every
dance
occasionally
with
one
or
another
of
the
notables
present
but
usually
with
herkimer
herkimer
third
a
drink
he
asked
a
small
cold
one
not
so
small
and
cold
she
agreed
enthusiastically
glass
in
hand
herkimer
indicated
a
nearby
doorway
i
just
heard
that
our
host
has
acquired
a
very
old
and
very
fine
bronze
a
neptune
we
should
run
an
eye
over
it
do
you
think
by
all
means
she
agreed
again
but
as
they
passed
through
the
shadowed
portal
the
man
head
jerked
to
the
right
something
you
really
ought
to
see
jill
he
exclaimed
look
she
looked
a
young
woman
of
her
own
height
and
build
and
with
her
own
flamboyant
hair
identical
as
to
and
as
to
every
fine
detail
of
dress
and
of
ornamentation
glass
in
hand
was
strolling
back
into
the
jill
started
to
protest
but
could
not
in
the
brief
moment
of
inaction
the
beam
of
a
had
played
along
her
spine
from
hips
to
neck
she
did
not
fall
he
had
given
her
a
very
mild
jolt
but
rage
as
she
would
she
could
neither
struggle
nor
scream
and
after
the
fact
she
knew
but
he
could
nevian
were
as
outlawed
as
was
vee
two
gas
itself
nevertheless
he
had
and
on
the
instant
a
woman
dressed
in
crisp
and
spotless
white
and
carrying
a
hooded
cloak
appeared
and
herkimer
now
wore
a
beard
and
heavy
horn
rimmed
spectacles
thus
very
shortly
virgilia
samms
found
herself
completely
helpless
and
completely
unrecognizable
walking
awkwardly
out
of
the
house
between
a
businesslike
doctor
and
a
solicitous
nurse
will
you
need
me
any
more
doctor
murray
the
woman
carefully
and
expertly
loaded
the
patient
into
the
rear
seat
of
a
car
thank
you
no
miss
childs
with
a
sick
cold
certainty
jill
knew
that
this
conversation
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
doorman
and
the
hackers
and
that
it
would
stand
up
under
any
examination
harman
condition
is
er
well
nothing
at
all
serious
the
car
moved
out
into
the
street
and
jill
really
frightened
for
the
first
time
in
her
triumphant
life
fought
down
an
almost
overwhelming
wave
of
panic
the
hood
had
slipped
down
over
her
eyes
blinding
her
she
could
not
move
a
single
voluntary
muscle
nevertheless
she
knew
that
the
car
traveled
a
few
blocks
six
she
thought
west
on
bolton
street
before
turning
left
why
did
somebody
lens
her
her
father
would
she
knew
until
tomorrow
neither
of
the
kinnisons
would
nor
spud
they
never
did
except
on
direct
invitation
but
mase
would
before
he
went
to
bed
or
would
he
it
was
past
his
now
and
she
had
been
pretty
caustic
only
last
night
because
she
was
doing
a
particularly
delicate
bit
of
reading
but
he
would
he
mase
mase
and
eventually
mase
did
deep
under
the
hill
roderick
kinnison
swore
fulminantly
at
the
sheer
physical
impossibility
of
getting
out
of
that
furiously
radiating
mountain
in
a
hurry
at
new
york
spaceport
however
mason
northrop
and
jack
kinnison
not
only
could
hurry
but
did
where
are
you
jill
northrop
demanded
presently
what
kind
of
a
car
are
you
in
quite
near
stanhope
circle
in
communication
with
her
friends
at
last
jill
regained
a
measure
of
her
usual
poise
within
eight
or
ten
blocks
i
sure
i
in
a
black
wilford
sedan
last
year
model
i
did
get
a
chance
to
see
its
license
plates
that
helps
a
lot
jack
grunted
savagely
a
radius
covers
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
territory
and
half
the
cars
in
town
are
black
wilford
sedans
shut
up
jack
go
ahead
jill
tell
us
all
you
can
and
keep
on
sending
us
anything
that
will
help
at
all
i
kept
the
right
and
left
turns
and
distances
straight
for
quite
a
while
about
twenty
blocks
that
how
i
know
it
was
stanhope
circle
i
do
know
how
many
times
he
went
around
the
circle
though
or
which
way
he
went
when
he
left
it
after
leaving
the
circle
the
traffic
was
very
light
and
here
there
does
seem
to
be
any
traffic
at
all
that
brings
us
up
to
date
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
what
happens
next
with
jill
the
lensmen
knew
that
herkimer
drove
his
car
up
to
the
curb
and
stopped
parked
without
backing
up
he
got
out
and
hauled
the
girl
limp
body
out
of
the
car
displacing
the
hood
enough
to
free
one
eye
good
only
one
other
car
was
visible
a
bright
yellow
convertible
parked
across
the
street
about
half
a
block
ahead
there
was
a
sign
no
parking
on
this
side
to
the
building
toward
which
he
was
carrying
her
was
more
than
three
stories
high
and
had
a
number
one
four
if
he
would
swing
her
a
little
bit
more
so
that
she
could
see
the
rest
of
it
one
rushton
boulevard
you
think
mase
could
be
fourteen
seventy
nine
would
be
on
the
side
blast
into
the
building
where
two
masked
men
locked
and
barred
the
door
behind
them
and
keep
it
locked
herkimer
ordered
you
know
what
to
do
until
i
come
back
down
into
an
elevator
and
up
through
massive
double
doors
into
a
room
whose
most
conspicuous
item
of
furniture
was
a
heavy
steel
chair
bolted
to
the
floor
two
masked
men
got
up
and
placed
themselves
behind
that
chair
jill
strength
was
coming
back
fast
but
not
fast
enough
the
cloak
was
removed
her
ankles
were
tied
firmly
one
to
each
front
leg
of
the
chair
herkimer
threw
four
turns
of
rope
around
her
torso
and
the
chair
back
took
up
every
inch
of
slack
and
tied
a
workmanlike
knot
then
still
without
a
word
he
stood
back
and
lighted
a
cigarette
the
last
trace
of
paralysis
disappeared
but
the
girl
mad
struggles
futile
as
they
were
were
not
allowed
to
continue
put
a
double
hammerlock
on
her
herkimer
directed
but
be
damned
sure
not
to
break
anything
at
this
stage
of
the
game
that
comes
later
jill
more
furiously
angry
than
frightened
until
now
locked
her
teeth
to
keep
from
screaming
as
the
pressure
went
on
she
could
not
bend
forward
to
relieve
the
pain
she
could
not
move
she
could
only
grit
her
teeth
and
glare
she
was
beginning
to
realize
however
what
was
actually
in
store
that
herkimer
herkimer
third
was
in
fact
a
monster
whose
like
she
had
never
known
he
stepped
quietly
forward
gathered
up
a
handful
of
fabric
and
heaved
the
strapless
and
backless
garment
in
no
way
designed
to
withstand
such
stresses
parted
squarely
across
at
the
upper
strand
of
rope
he
puffed
his
cigarette
to
a
vivid
coal
took
it
in
his
fingers
there
was
an
audible
hiss
and
a
tiny
stink
of
burning
flesh
as
the
glowing
ember
was
extinguished
in
the
clear
clean
skin
below
the
girl
left
armpit
jill
flinched
then
and
shrieked
desperately
but
her
tormentor
was
viciously
unmoved
that
was
just
to
settle
any
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
i
mean
business
i
all
done
fooling
around
with
you
i
want
to
know
two
things
first
everything
you
know
about
the
lens
where
it
comes
from
what
it
really
is
and
what
it
does
besides
what
your
advertise
second
what
really
happened
at
the
ambassadors
ball
start
talking
the
faster
you
talk
the
less
you
get
hurt
you
ca
get
away
with
this
herkimer
jill
tried
desperately
to
pull
her
shattered
nerves
together
i
be
missed
traced
she
paused
gasping
if
she
told
him
that
the
lensmen
were
in
full
and
continuous
communication
with
her
and
if
he
believed
it
he
would
kill
her
right
then
she
switched
instantly
to
another
track
that
double
is
good
enough
to
fool
anybody
who
really
knows
me
she
does
have
to
be
the
man
grinned
venomously
nobody
who
knows
you
will
get
close
enough
to
her
to
tell
the
difference
this
done
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
jill
it
was
planned
minutely
you
have
got
the
chance
of
the
proverbial
celluloid
dog
in
hell
jill
jack
kinnison
thought
stabbed
in
it
rushton
fourteen
is
a
what
other
streets
could
it
be
i
do
know
she
was
not
in
very
good
shape
to
think
damnation
got
to
get
hold
of
somebody
who
knows
the
streets
spud
grab
a
hacker
at
the
circle
and
i
lens
parker
jack
thought
snapped
off
as
he
tuned
to
a
local
lensman
jill
heart
sank
she
was
starkly
certain
now
that
the
lensmen
could
not
find
her
in
time
tighten
up
a
little
eddie
you
too
bob
stop
it
oh
god
stop
it
the
unbearable
agony
relaxed
a
little
she
watched
in
horrified
fascination
a
second
glowing
coal
approach
her
bare
right
side
even
if
i
do
talk
you
kill
me
anyway
you
let
me
go
now
kill
you
my
pet
not
if
you
behave
yourself
we
got
a
lot
of
planets
the
patrol
never
heard
of
and
you
could
keep
a
man
interested
for
quite
a
while
if
you
really
tried
and
if
you
beg
hard
enough
maybe
i
let
you
try
however
i
get
just
as
much
fun
out
of
killing
you
as
out
of
the
other
so
it
up
to
you
not
sudden
death
of
course
little
things
at
first
like
we
been
doing
a
few
more
touches
of
warmth
here
and
there
so
scream
as
much
as
you
please
i
enjoy
it
and
this
room
is
once
more
boys
about
half
an
inch
higher
this
time
up
steady
down
we
have
half
an
hour
or
so
of
this
stuff
herkimer
knew
that
to
the
quivering
sensitive
highly
imaginative
girl
his
words
would
be
practically
as
punishing
as
the
atrocious
actualities
themselves
then
i
do
things
to
your
and
beginning
with
burning
slivers
of
flare
powder
and
working
up
then
your
eyes
or
no
i
save
them
until
last
so
you
can
watch
a
couple
of
venerian
work
on
you
one
on
each
leg
and
a
martian
digger
on
your
bare
belly
gripping
her
hair
firmly
in
his
left
hand
he
forced
her
head
back
and
down
down
almost
to
her
hands
his
right
hand
concealing
something
which
he
had
not
mentioned
and
which
was
probably
starkly
unmentionable
approached
her
throat
talk
or
not
just
as
you
please
the
voice
was
utterly
callous
as
chill
as
the
death
she
now
knew
he
was
so
willing
to
deal
but
listen
if
you
elect
to
talk
tell
the
truth
you
wo
lie
twice
i
count
to
ten
one
jill
uttered
a
gurgling
strangling
noise
and
he
lifted
her
head
a
trifle
can
you
talk
now
yes
two
helpless
immobile
scared
now
to
a
depth
of
terror
she
had
never
imagined
it
possible
to
feel
jill
fought
her
wrenched
and
shaken
mind
back
from
insanity
very
edge
managed
with
a
pale
tongue
to
lick
bloodless
lips
pops
kinnison
always
said
a
man
could
die
only
once
but
he
did
know
in
battle
yes
perhaps
but
she
had
already
died
a
dozen
times
but
she
keep
on
dying
forever
before
she
say
a
word
but
tell
him
jill
northrop
thought
beat
at
her
mind
he
her
lover
was
unashamedly
frantic
as
much
with
sheer
rage
as
with
sympathy
for
her
physical
and
mental
anguish
for
the
nineteenth
time
i
say
we
just
located
you
hancock
avenue
we
be
there
in
two
minutes
yes
jill
quit
being
a
damned
stubborn
jackass
and
jack
kinnison
thought
bit
deep
but
this
time
strangely
enough
the
girl
felt
no
repugnance
at
his
touch
there
was
nothing
whatever
of
the
lover
nor
of
the
brother
except
of
the
fraternity
of
arms
she
belonged
she
would
come
out
of
this
brawl
right
side
up
or
none
of
them
would
tell
the
goddam
rat
the
truth
jack
thought
drove
on
it
wo
make
any
difference
he
wo
live
long
enough
to
pass
it
on
but
i
ca
i
wo
jill
stormed
why
pops
kinnison
would
not
this
time
i
would
jill
samms
thought
tried
to
come
in
too
but
the
port
admiral
vehemence
was
overwhelming
no
harm
he
doing
this
strictly
on
his
own
if
morgan
had
had
any
idea
killed
him
first
start
talking
or
i
spank
you
to
a
rosy
blister
they
were
to
laugh
later
at
the
incongruity
of
that
threat
but
it
did
produce
results
nine
herkimer
grinned
wolfishly
in
sadistic
anticipation
stop
it
i
tell
she
screamed
stop
it
take
that
thing
away
i
ca
it
i
tell
she
burst
into
racking
tearing
sobs
steady
herkimer
put
something
in
his
pocket
then
slapped
her
so
viciously
that
marks
sprang
into
red
relief
upon
the
background
of
her
cheek
do
crack
up
i
have
started
to
work
on
you
yet
what
about
that
lens
she
gulped
twice
before
she
could
speak
it
comes
from
ulp
arisia
i
have
got
one
myself
so
i
do
know
very
much
ulp
about
it
at
first
hand
but
from
what
the
boys
tell
me
it
must
be
outside
the
building
three
black
forms
arrowed
downward
northrop
and
young
kinnison
stopped
at
the
sixth
level
costigan
went
on
down
to
take
care
of
the
guards
bullets
not
beams
the
irishman
reminded
his
younger
fellows
have
to
clean
up
the
mess
without
leaving
a
trace
so
do
do
any
more
damage
to
the
property
than
you
absolutely
have
to
neither
made
any
reply
they
were
both
too
busy
the
two
thugs
standing
behind
the
steel
chair
being
armed
openly
went
first
then
jack
put
a
bullet
through
herkimer
head
but
northrop
was
not
content
with
that
he
slid
the
pin
to
full
automatic
and
ten
more
heavy
slugs
tore
into
the
falling
body
before
it
struck
the
floor
three
quick
slashes
and
the
girl
was
free
jill
mase
locked
in
each
other
arms
straining
together
no
bystander
would
have
believed
that
this
was
their
first
kiss
it
was
plainly
yes
quite
spectacularly
evident
however
that
it
would
not
be
their
last
jack
blushing
furiously
picked
up
the
cloak
and
flung
it
at
the
oblivious
couple
jill
wrap
up
he
whispered
urgently
all
the
top
brass
in
space
is
coming
at
full
emergency
blast
be
scrambled
eggs
all
over
the
place
any
second
now
your
thick
hard
skull
snap
out
of
it
he
always
frothing
at
the
mouth
about
her
running
around
half
naked
and
if
he
sees
her
like
this
especially
with
he
simply
have
a
litter
of
lizards
you
get
a
million
black
spots
and
seven
hundred
years
in
the
clink
that
better
now
i
see
you
up
at
new
york
spaceport
jack
kinnison
dashed
to
the
nearest
window
threw
it
open
and
dived
headlong
out
of
the
building
chapter
the
employment
office
of
any
concern
with
personnel
running
into
the
hundreds
of
thousands
is
a
busy
place
indeed
even
when
its
plants
are
all
on
tellus
and
its
working
conditions
are
as
nearly
ideal
as
such
things
can
be
made
when
that
firm
business
is
colonial
however
and
its
working
conditions
are
only
a
couple
of
degrees
removed
from
slavery
procurement
of
personnel
is
a
problem
the
personnel
department
like
alice
in
wonderland
must
run
as
fast
as
it
can
go
in
order
to
stay
where
it
is
thus
the
help
wanted
advertisements
of
uranium
incorporated
covered
the
planet
earth
with
blandishment
and
guile
and
thus
for
twelve
hours
of
every
day
and
for
seven
days
of
every
week
the
employment
offices
of
uranium
were
filled
with
men
mostly
the
scum
of
earth
there
were
of
course
exceptions
one
of
which
strode
through
the
motley
group
of
waiting
men
and
thrust
a
card
through
the
information
wicket
he
was
a
individual
appearing
shorter
than
his
actual
five
feet
nine
because
of
a
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
of
weight
even
though
every
pound
was
placed
exactly
where
it
would
do
the
most
good
he
looked
well
slouchy
and
his
mien
was
sullen
birkenfeld
by
appointment
he
growled
through
the
wicket
in
a
voice
which
could
have
been
pleasantly
deep
the
coolly
efficient
blonde
manipulated
plugs
george
jones
sir
by
appointment
thank
you
sir
and
jones
was
escorted
into
birkenfeld
private
office
have
a
chair
please
er
jones
so
you
know
yes
it
is
seldom
that
a
man
of
your
education
training
and
demonstrated
ability
applies
to
us
for
employment
of
his
own
initiative
and
a
very
thorough
investigation
is
indicated
what
am
i
here
for
then
the
visitor
demanded
truculently
you
could
have
turned
me
down
by
mail
everybody
else
has
since
i
got
out
you
are
here
because
we
who
operate
on
the
frontiers
can
not
afford
to
pass
judgment
upon
a
man
because
of
his
past
unless
that
past
precludes
the
probability
of
a
useful
future
yours
does
not
and
in
some
cases
such
as
yours
we
are
very
deeply
interested
in
the
future
the
official
eyes
drilled
deep
conway
costigan
had
never
been
in
the
limelight
on
the
contrary
he
had
made
inconspicuousness
a
passion
and
an
art
even
in
such
scenes
of
violence
as
that
which
had
occurred
at
the
ambassadors
ball
he
managed
to
remain
unnoticed
his
lens
had
never
been
visible
no
one
except
lensmen
and
clio
and
jill
knew
that
he
had
one
and
lensmen
and
clio
and
jill
did
not
talk
although
he
was
calmly
certain
that
this
birkenfeld
was
not
an
ordinary
interviewer
he
was
equally
certain
that
the
investigators
of
uranium
had
found
out
exactly
and
only
what
the
patrol
had
wanted
them
to
find
so
jones
bearing
altered
subtly
and
not
because
of
the
penetrant
eyes
that
all
i
want
a
chance
i
start
at
the
bottom
as
far
down
as
you
say
we
advertise
and
truthfully
that
opportunity
on
eridan
is
unlimited
birkenfeld
chose
his
words
with
care
in
your
case
opportunity
will
be
either
absolutely
unlimited
or
zero
depending
entirely
upon
yourself
i
see
dumbness
had
not
been
included
in
the
fictitious
background
you
do
need
to
draw
a
you
do
i
think
the
interviewer
nodded
in
approval
nevertheless
i
must
make
our
position
entirely
clear
if
the
slip
was
shall
we
say
accidental
you
will
go
far
with
us
if
you
try
to
play
false
you
will
not
last
long
and
you
will
not
be
missed
fair
enough
your
willingness
to
start
at
the
bottom
is
commendable
and
it
is
a
fact
that
those
who
come
up
through
the
ranks
make
the
best
executives
in
our
line
at
least
just
how
far
down
are
you
willing
to
start
how
low
do
you
go
a
mucker
i
think
would
be
low
enough
and
from
your
build
and
obvious
physical
strength
the
logical
job
mucker
one
who
skoufers
ore
in
the
mine
nor
can
we
make
any
exception
in
your
case
as
to
the
routines
of
induction
and
transportation
of
course
not
take
this
slip
to
calkins
in
room
he
will
run
you
through
the
mill
and
that
night
in
an
obscure
george
washington
jones
after
a
meticulous
service
special
survey
in
every
direction
reached
a
large
and
somewhat
grimy
hand
into
a
screened
receptacle
in
his
battered
suitcase
and
touched
a
lens
clio
the
lovely
mother
of
their
wonderful
children
appeared
in
his
mind
made
it
sweetheart
no
suspicion
at
all
no
more
lensing
for
a
while
not
too
long
i
hope
so
clio
take
it
easy
spud
darling
and
her
tone
was
light
but
she
could
not
conceal
a
stark
background
of
fear
oh
i
i
could
go
too
i
wish
you
could
tootie
the
linked
minds
flashed
back
to
what
the
two
had
done
together
in
the
red
opacity
of
nevian
murk
on
mighty
watery
globe
but
that
kind
of
thinking
would
not
do
but
the
boys
will
keep
in
touch
with
me
and
keep
you
posted
and
besides
you
know
how
hard
it
is
to
get
a
it
is
strange
that
the
fundamental
operations
of
working
metalliferous
veins
have
changed
so
little
throughout
the
ages
or
is
it
ores
came
into
being
with
the
crusts
of
the
planets
they
change
appreciably
only
with
the
passage
of
geologic
time
ancient
mines
of
course
could
not
go
down
very
deep
or
follow
a
seam
very
far
there
was
too
much
water
and
too
little
air
the
steam
engine
helped
in
degree
if
not
in
kind
by
removing
water
and
supplying
air
tools
improved
from
the
simple
metal
bar
through
pick
and
shovel
and
candle
through
drill
and
hammer
and
low
explosive
and
acetylene
through
sullivan
slugger
and
high
explosive
and
electrics
through
skoufer
and
rotary
and
burley
and
sourceless
glow
to
the
complex
gadgetry
of
today
but
what
fundamentally
is
the
difference
men
still
crawl
to
where
the
metal
is
men
still
by
dint
of
sheer
brawn
jackass
the
precious
stuff
out
to
where
our
vaunted
automatics
can
get
hold
of
it
and
men
still
die
in
horribly
unknown
fashions
and
in
callously
recorded
numbers
in
the
mines
which
supply
the
stuff
upon
which
our
vaunted
culture
rests
but
to
resume
the
thread
of
narrative
george
washington
jones
went
to
eridan
as
a
common
laborer
a
mucker
he
floated
down
beside
the
skip
a
skip
is
a
mine
elevator
some
four
thousand
eight
hundred
feet
he
rode
an
a
horizontal
distance
of
approximately
eight
miles
to
the
cavern
which
was
the
station
of
the
twelfth
and
lowest
level
he
was
assigned
to
the
bunk
in
which
he
would
sleep
for
the
next
fifteen
nights
fifteen
down
and
three
up
ran
the
standard
underground
contract
he
walked
four
hundred
yards
yelled
nothing
down
and
inched
his
way
up
a
rise
in
many
places
scarcely
wider
than
his
shoulders
to
the
stope
some
three
hundred
feet
above
he
reported
to
the
miner
who
was
to
be
his
immediate
boss
and
bent
his
back
to
the
skoufer
which
while
not
resembling
a
shovel
at
all
closely
still
meant
hard
physical
labor
he
already
knew
ore
the
glossy
pitchy
black
luster
of
uraninite
or
pitchblende
the
yellows
of
autunite
and
carnotite
the
variant
and
confusing
greens
of
tobernite
no
values
went
from
jones
skoufer
into
the
of
the
stope
very
little
base
rock
went
down
the
rise
he
became
accustomed
to
the
work
got
used
to
breathing
the
peculiarly
lifeless
dry
oily
compressed
air
and
when
after
a
few
days
his
stentorian
nothing
down
called
forth
a
nothing
but
a
little
fine
stuff
and
a
handful
of
grit
and
pebbles
he
knew
that
he
had
been
accepted
into
the
undefined
unwritten
and
unofficial
yet
nevertheless
intensely
actual
fellowship
of
men
he
belonged
he
knew
that
he
must
abandon
his
policy
of
invisibility
and
after
several
days
of
thought
he
decided
how
he
would
do
it
hence
upon
the
first
day
of
his
up
period
he
joined
his
fellows
in
their
descent
upon
one
of
the
rawest
noisiest
dives
of
danapolis
the
men
were
met
of
course
by
a
bevy
of
giggling
shrieking
garishly
painted
and
strongly
perfumed
girls
and
at
this
point
young
jones
behavior
became
exceedingly
unorthodox
buy
me
a
drink
mister
and
a
dance
huh
on
your
way
sister
he
brushed
the
importunate
wench
aside
i
get
enough
exercise
underground
an
you
ai
got
a
thing
i
want
apparently
unaware
that
the
girl
was
exchanging
meaningful
glances
with
a
couple
of
husky
characters
labelled
bouncer
in
billposter
type
the
atypical
mucker
strode
up
to
the
long
and
ornate
bar
gim
me
a
bottle
of
pineapple
pop
he
ordered
bruskly
an
a
package
of
tellurian
cigarettes
sunshines
the
surprised
bartender
did
not
finish
the
word
the
bouncers
were
fast
but
costigan
was
faster
a
hard
knee
took
one
in
the
solar
plexus
a
hard
elbow
took
the
other
so
savagely
under
the
chin
as
to
all
but
break
his
neck
a
bartender
started
to
swing
a
and
found
himself
flying
through
the
air
toward
a
table
men
table
and
drinks
crashed
to
the
floor
i
pick
my
own
company
an
i
drink
what
i
damn
please
jones
announced
grittily
them
lunkers
ai
hurt
none
to
speak
of
his
hard
eyes
swept
the
room
malevolently
but
i
ai
in
no
gentle
mood
an
the
next
jaspers
that
tackle
me
will
wind
up
in
the
repair
shop
or
maybe
in
the
morgue
see
this
of
course
was
much
too
much
a
dozen
embattled
roughnecks
leaped
to
mop
up
on
the
misguided
wight
who
had
so
impugned
the
manhood
of
all
eridan
then
while
six
or
seven
bartenders
blew
frantic
blasts
upon
police
whistles
there
was
a
flurry
of
action
too
fast
to
be
resolved
into
consecutive
events
by
the
eye
conway
costigan
one
of
the
fastest
men
with
hands
and
feet
the
patrol
has
ever
known
was
trying
to
keep
himself
alive
and
he
succeeded
what
the
hell
goes
on
here
a
chorus
of
raucously
authoritative
voices
yelled
and
sixteen
policemen
john
law
did
not
travel
singly
in
that
district
but
in
platoons
swinging
clubs
and
saps
finally
hauled
george
washington
jones
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
pile
he
had
sundry
abrasions
and
not
a
few
contusions
but
no
bones
were
broken
and
his
skin
was
practically
whole
and
since
his
version
of
the
affair
was
not
only
inadequate
but
also
differed
in
important
particulars
from
those
of
several
witnesses
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
holiday
in
jail
a
development
with
which
he
was
quite
content
the
work
and
time
went
on
he
became
in
rapid
succession
a
head
mucker
a
miner
pimp
which
short
and
rugged
word
means
simply
helper
in
underground
parlance
a
miner
a
and
then
a
long
step
up
the
ladder
a
and
then
disaster
struck
suddenly
paralyzingly
as
mine
disasters
do
blared
briefly
explosion
flood
fire
gas
radiation
damp
and
expired
there
was
no
way
of
telling
which
if
any
of
those
dire
warnings
were
true
the
power
failed
and
the
lights
the
hiss
of
air
from
valves
a
noise
which
by
its
constant
and
unvarying
and
universal
presence
soon
becomes
unheard
became
noticeable
because
of
its
diminution
in
volume
and
tone
and
then
seconds
later
a
jarring
shuddering
rumble
was
felt
and
heard
accompanied
by
the
snapping
of
shattered
timbers
and
the
sharper
utterly
unforgettable
shriek
of
rending
and
riven
steel
and
the
men
as
men
do
under
such
conditions
went
wild
yelling
swearing
leaping
toward
where
in
the
rayless
dark
each
thought
the
rise
to
be
it
took
a
couple
of
seconds
for
the
to
break
out
and
hook
up
his
emergency
and
three
or
four
more
seconds
and
by
dint
of
fists
feet
and
a
length
of
to
restore
any
degree
of
order
four
men
were
dead
but
that
was
too
bad
considering
up
there
under
the
hanging
wall
he
ordered
sharply
fall
unless
the
whole
mountain
slips
now
how
many
of
you
jaspers
have
got
your
emergency
kits
on
you
twelve
out
of
what
brains
put
on
your
masks
you
without
can
stay
up
here
you
be
safe
for
a
while
i
hope
then
presently
there
that
all
for
now
i
guess
he
flashed
his
light
downward
the
massive
steel
members
no
longer
writhed
the
crushed
and
tortured
timbers
were
still
that
rise
may
be
open
it
goes
through
solid
rock
not
waste
see
wright
you
all
in
one
piece
are
you
i
guess
so
yes
take
charge
up
here
i
go
down
to
the
drift
if
the
rise
is
open
i
give
you
a
flash
send
the
ones
with
masks
down
one
at
a
time
take
a
and
bash
the
brains
out
of
anybody
who
gets
panicky
again
jones
was
not
as
brave
as
he
sounded
mine
disasters
carry
a
terror
which
is
uniquely
and
peculiarly
poignant
nevertheless
he
went
down
the
rise
found
it
open
and
signalled
then
after
issuing
brief
orders
he
led
the
way
along
the
dark
and
silent
drift
toward
the
station
wondering
profanely
why
the
people
on
duty
there
had
not
done
something
with
the
wealth
of
emergency
equipment
always
ready
there
the
party
found
some
but
nothing
they
could
not
dig
through
the
station
was
also
silent
and
dark
jones
flashing
his
upon
the
emergency
panel
smashed
the
glass
wrenched
the
door
open
and
pushed
buttons
lights
flashed
on
warning
signals
flared
bellowed
and
rang
the
rotary
began
again
its
normal
subdued
whickering
whirr
but
the
shuddering
clanking
groaning
it
was
threatening
to
go
out
any
second
but
there
was
a
thing
in
the
world
jones
could
do
about
it
yet
the
station
itself
so
buttressed
and
pillared
with
alloy
steel
as
to
be
little
more
compressible
than
an
equal
volume
of
solid
rock
was
unharmed
but
in
it
nothing
lived
four
men
and
a
woman
the
nurse
were
stiffly
motionless
at
their
posts
apparently
the
leads
to
the
station
had
been
blasted
in
such
fashion
that
no
warning
whatever
had
been
given
and
smoke
billowing
inward
from
the
main
tunnel
was
growing
thicker
by
the
minute
jones
punched
another
button
a
barrier
of
asbestos
tungsten
and
vitrified
refractory
slid
smoothly
across
the
tunnel
opening
he
considered
briefly
pityingly
those
who
might
be
outside
but
felt
no
urge
to
explore
if
any
lived
there
were
buttons
on
the
other
side
of
the
the
eddying
smoke
disappeared
the
flaring
lights
winked
out
and
bells
relapsed
into
silence
the
now
apparently
the
superintendent
of
the
whole
twelfth
level
removed
his
mask
found
the
station
and
snapped
a
switch
he
spoke
listened
spoke
again
then
called
a
list
of
names
none
of
which
brought
any
response
wright
and
you
five
others
picking
out
miners
who
could
be
depended
upon
to
keep
their
heads
take
these
guns
shoot
if
you
have
to
but
not
unless
you
have
to
have
the
muckers
clear
the
drift
just
enough
to
get
through
you
find
a
with
a
crew
of
nineteen
up
in
stope
sixty
their
rise
is
blocked
they
got
light
and
power
again
now
and
good
air
and
they
working
on
it
but
opening
the
rise
from
the
top
is
a
damned
slow
job
wright
you
throw
a
chippie
into
it
from
the
bottom
you
others
work
back
along
the
drift
clear
to
the
last
glory
hole
be
sure
that
all
the
rises
are
open
check
all
the
stopes
and
glory
holes
tell
everybody
you
find
alive
to
report
to
me
here
aw
what
good
a
man
shrieked
we
all
goners
anyway
i
want
an
shut
up
fool
there
was
a
sound
as
of
fist
meeting
flesh
the
shriek
was
stilled
plenty
of
water
tanks
full
of
the
stuff
a
grizzled
miner
turned
to
the
boss
and
twitched
his
head
toward
the
laboring
pump
too
damn
much
water
too
soon
huh
i
would
wonder
but
get
busy
as
his
now
orderly
and
purposeful
men
disappeared
jones
picked
up
his
microphone
and
changed
the
setting
of
a
dial
on
top
somebody
he
said
crisply
on
top
oh
there
somebody
alive
down
in
twelve
after
all
a
girl
voice
screamed
in
his
ear
clancy
mr
edwards
to
hell
with
clancy
and
edwards
too
jones
barked
gim
me
the
chief
engineer
and
the
head
surveyor
and
gim
me
clancy
speaking
station
twelve
if
works
manager
clancy
had
heard
that
pointed
remark
and
he
must
have
he
ignored
it
stanley
and
emerson
will
be
here
in
a
moment
in
the
meantime
who
calling
i
do
recognize
your
voice
and
it
been
so
long
jones
stope
fifty
nine
i
had
a
little
trouble
getting
here
to
the
station
what
where
pennoyer
and
riley
and
dead
everybody
gas
or
damp
no
warning
not
enough
to
turn
on
not
even
the
purifiers
nothing
where
were
you
up
in
the
stope
good
god
that
news
to
clancy
was
informative
enough
but
to
hell
with
all
that
what
happened
and
where
a
and
then
a
magazine
of
high
explosive
right
at
station
seven
it
right
at
the
main
shaft
you
know
jones
did
not
know
since
he
had
never
been
in
that
part
of
the
mine
but
he
could
see
the
picture
main
shaft
filled
up
to
above
seven
and
both
emergency
shafts
blocked
number
one
at
six
number
two
at
seven
must
have
been
a
fault
but
here
chief
engineer
stanley
the
works
manager
not
too
unwillingly
relinquished
the
microphone
a
miner
came
running
up
and
jones
covered
his
how
about
the
glory
holes
plugged
solid
all
four
of
by
the
vibro
clear
up
to
eleven
thanks
then
as
soon
as
stanley
voice
came
on
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
is
this
damned
overloading
what
the
circuit
you
must
be
yes
you
are
pumping
against
too
much
head
five
levels
above
you
are
dead
you
know
so
dead
ca
you
raise
not
yet
so
you
pumping
through
dead
boosters
on
eleven
and
ten
and
so
on
up
and
when
your
valve
opens
valve
jones
almost
screamed
can
i
dog
the
damn
thing
down
no
it
internal
christ
what
a
design
i
could
eat
a
handful
of
iron
filings
and
a
better
emergency
pump
than
that
when
it
opens
stanley
went
stolidly
on
the
water
will
go
through
the
back
into
the
sump
so
you
better
rod
out
one
of
the
glory
holes
and
get
conscious
jones
blazed
what
would
we
use
for
time
get
off
the
air
gim
me
emerson
emerson
speaking
got
your
maps
yes
we
got
to
run
a
sag
up
to
eleven
fast
or
drown
can
you
give
me
the
shortest
possible
distance
can
do
the
head
surveyor
snapped
orders
we
have
it
for
you
in
a
minute
thank
god
there
was
somebody
down
there
with
a
brain
it
does
take
intelligence
to
push
buttons
you
be
surprised
your
point
on
glory
holes
was
very
well
taken
you
wo
have
much
time
after
the
pump
quits
when
the
water
reaches
the
station
curtains
and
it
all
done
now
running
free
and
easy
recirculating
hurry
that
dope
here
it
is
now
start
at
the
highest
point
of
stope
fifty
nine
repeat
stope
jones
waved
a
furious
hand
as
he
shouted
the
words
the
miners
turned
and
ran
the
followed
them
carrying
the
aiming
an
exasperated
kick
of
pure
frustration
at
the
water
pump
as
he
passed
it
thirty
two
degrees
from
the
vertical
anywhere
between
thirty
and
thirty
five
thirty
to
thirty
five
off
vertical
direction
got
a
compass
yes
set
the
blue
on
zero
course
two
hundred
seventy
five
degrees
blue
on
zero
course
two
seven
five
dex
sixty
nine
point
two
zero
feet
that
put
you
into
class
yard
so
big
you
ca
miss
it
distance
sixty
nine
point
two
all
fine
maybe
we
make
it
after
all
they
sinking
a
shaft
of
course
from
where
about
four
miles
in
on
six
it
take
time
if
we
can
get
up
into
eleven
we
have
all
the
time
on
the
clock
it
take
a
week
or
more
to
flood
twelve
stopes
but
this
sag
is
sure
as
hell
going
to
be
touch
and
go
and
say
from
the
throw
of
the
pump
and
the
volume
of
the
sump
will
you
give
me
the
best
estimate
you
can
of
how
much
time
we
got
i
want
at
least
an
hour
but
afraid
i
wo
have
it
yes
i
call
you
back
the
elbowed
his
way
through
the
throng
of
men
and
dragging
the
radio
behind
him
wriggled
and
floated
up
the
rise
wright
he
bellowed
the
echoes
resounding
deafeningly
all
up
and
down
the
narrow
tube
you
up
there
ahead
of
me
yeah
that
worthy
bellowed
back
more
men
left
than
i
thought
how
many
half
of
just
about
good
sort
out
the
ones
you
got
up
there
by
trades
then
when
he
had
emerged
into
the
now
brilliantly
illuminated
stope
where
are
the
over
there
rustle
timbers
whatever
you
can
find
and
wherever
you
find
it
grab
it
and
bring
it
up
here
get
some
steel
too
six
feet
long
timbermen
grab
that
stuff
off
of
the
face
and
start
your
staging
right
here
you
muckers
rig
a
couple
of
skoufers
to
throw
muck
to
bury
the
base
and
checkerwork
up
to
the
hanging
wall
doze
a
down
into
that
waste
pocket
there
so
we
wo
clog
ourselves
up
work
fast
fellows
but
make
it
you
know
the
load
it
have
to
carry
and
what
will
happen
if
it
gives
they
knew
they
knew
what
they
had
to
do
and
did
it
furiously
but
with
care
and
precision
how
wide
a
sag
you
figurin
on
supe
the
boss
timberman
asked
eight
foot
checkerwork
to
the
hangin
anyway
huh
yes
i
let
you
know
in
a
minute
the
surveyor
came
in
forty
one
minutes
is
my
best
guess
from
when
from
the
time
the
pump
failed
that
was
four
minutes
ago
nearer
five
and
five
more
before
we
can
start
cutting
forty
one
less
ten
is
thirty
one
thirty
one
into
sixty
nine
point
two
goes
two
point
two
three
feet
per
minute
my
says
thanks
wright
what
would
you
say
is
the
biggest
sag
we
can
cut
in
this
kind
of
rock
at
two
and
a
quarter
feet
a
minute
um
m
m
the
miner
scratched
his
whiskery
chin
that
a
tough
one
boss
you
hafta
figure
damn
close
to
a
hundred
pounds
of
air
to
the
foot
on
plain
cuttin
that
two
hundred
and
a
quarter
but
without
a
burley
to
pimp
for
a
rotary
ca
take
that
kind
of
air
she
foul
herself
to
a
standstill
before
she
cuts
a
foot
with
a
burley
riggin
she
got
to
make
damn
near
a
double
cut
seven
foot
inside
figger
so
any
way
you
look
at
it
you
ai
goin
to
cut
no
two
foot
to
the
minute
i
was
hoping
you
would
check
my
figures
but
you
do
so
we
cut
five
feet
saw
your
timbers
accordingly
we
hold
that
burley
by
hand
wright
shook
his
head
dubiously
we
do
want
to
die
down
here
any
more
than
you
do
boss
so
we
do
our
damndest
but
how
in
do
you
figure
you
can
hold
her
to
her
work
rig
a
yoke
cut
a
stretcher
up
for
canvas
and
padding
it
pound
but
a
man
can
stand
almost
anything
in
short
enough
shifts
if
got
to
or
die
and
for
a
time
two
minutes
to
be
exact
during
which
the
rotary
chewed
up
and
spat
out
a
plug
of
rock
over
five
feet
deep
things
went
very
well
indeed
two
men
instead
of
the
usual
three
could
run
the
rotary
that
is
they
could
tend
the
complicated
pneumatic
walking
jacks
which
not
only
oscillated
the
cutting
demon
in
a
geometrical
path
but
also
rammed
it
against
the
face
with
a
steadily
held
and
enormous
pressure
even
while
climbing
almost
vertically
upward
under
a
burden
of
over
twenty
thousand
pounds
an
armored
hand
waved
a
signal
voice
was
utterly
useless
up
a
valve
was
flipped
a
huge
flat
steel
foot
arose
a
timber
slid
into
place
creaking
and
groaning
as
that
big
flat
foot
smashed
down
up
again
up
a
third
time
eighteen
seconds
less
than
of
a
minute
ten
inches
gained
and
while
it
was
not
easy
two
men
could
hold
the
burley
in
shifts
as
has
been
intimated
this
machine
pimped
for
the
rotary
it
waited
on
it
ministering
to
its
every
need
with
a
singleness
of
purpose
impossible
to
any
except
robotic
devotion
it
picked
the
rotary
teeth
it
freed
its
linkages
it
deloused
its
ports
it
cleared
its
spillways
of
compacted
debris
it
even
and
this
is
a
feat
starkly
unbelievable
to
anyone
who
does
not
know
the
hardness
of
neocarballoy
and
the
tensile
strength
of
steels
it
even
changed
while
in
full
operation
the
rotary
cutters
both
burley
and
rotary
were
extremely
efficient
but
neither
was
either
quiet
or
gentle
in
their
quietest
moments
they
shrieked
and
groaned
and
yelled
producing
a
volume
of
sound
in
which
nothing
softer
than
a
could
have
been
heard
but
when
in
changing
the
cutting
teeth
the
burley
fingers
were
driven
into
and
through
the
solid
rock
a
matter
of
merest
routine
to
both
machines
the
resultant
blasts
of
sound
can
not
even
be
imagined
to
say
nothing
of
being
described
and
always
both
machines
spewed
out
torrents
of
rock
in
sizes
ranging
from
impalpable
dust
up
to
chunks
as
big
as
a
fist
as
the
sag
lengthened
and
the
checkerwork
grew
higher
the
work
began
to
slow
down
they
began
to
lose
the
time
they
had
gained
there
were
plenty
of
men
but
in
that
narrow
bore
there
simply
was
not
room
for
enough
men
to
work
even
through
that
storm
of
dust
and
hurtling
rock
the
timbermen
could
get
their
blocking
up
there
but
they
could
not
place
it
fast
enough
there
were
too
many
other
men
in
the
way
one
of
them
had
to
get
out
since
one
man
could
not
run
the
rotary
one
man
would
have
to
hold
the
burley
they
tried
it
one
after
another
no
soap
it
hammered
them
flat
the
rotary
fouled
in
every
tooth
and
channel
and
vent
under
the
terrific
thrust
of
two
hundred
thirty
pounds
of
air
merely
gnawed
and
slid
the
timbermen
now
had
room
but
nothing
to
do
and
jones
who
had
been
biting
at
his
mustache
and
ignoring
the
frantic
for
minutes
stared
grimly
at
watch
and
tape
three
minutes
left
and
over
eight
feet
to
go
gim
me
that
armor
he
rasped
and
climbed
the
blocks
open
the
air
wide
open
give
the
whole
get
down
mac
i
take
it
the
rest
of
the
way
he
put
his
shoulders
to
the
improvised
yoke
braced
his
feet
and
heaved
the
burley
screaming
and
yelling
and
clamoring
went
joyously
to
work
both
ways
god
what
punishment
the
rotary
free
and
clear
chewed
rock
more
viciously
than
ever
an
armored
hand
smote
his
leg
lift
he
lifted
that
foot
set
it
down
two
inches
higher
the
other
one
four
inches
six
one
foot
two
three
lord
of
the
ancients
was
this
lifetime
of
agony
only
one
minute
or
was
he
holding
her
had
the
damn
thing
stopped
cutting
no
it
was
still
cutting
the
rocks
were
banging
against
and
bouncing
off
of
his
helmet
as
viciously
and
as
numerously
as
ever
he
could
sense
rather
than
feel
the
furious
fashion
in
which
the
relays
of
timbermen
were
laboring
to
keep
those
jacks
in
motion
no
it
had
been
only
one
minute
twice
that
long
yet
to
go
god
nothing
be
that
brutal
a
bull
elephant
could
take
it
but
by
all
the
gods
of
space
and
all
the
devils
in
hell
he
stay
with
it
until
that
sag
broke
through
and
grimly
doggedly
toward
the
end
unconsciously
lensman
conway
costigan
stayed
with
it
and
in
the
stope
so
far
below
a
new
and
highly
authoritative
voice
blared
from
the
speaker
jones
god
damn
it
jones
answer
me
if
jones
is
there
somebody
else
answer
me
yes
sir
wright
was
afraid
to
answer
that
peremptory
call
but
more
afraid
not
to
jones
this
is
clancy
no
sir
not
jones
wright
sir
top
miner
where
jones
up
in
the
sag
sir
he
holding
the
burley
alone
hell
purple
fires
tell
him
to
how
many
men
has
he
got
on
the
rotary
two
sir
that
all
they
room
for
tell
him
to
quit
it
put
somebody
else
on
it
i
have
him
killed
damn
it
he
the
only
one
strong
enough
to
hold
it
sir
but
i
send
up
word
word
went
up
via
sign
language
and
came
back
down
your
pardon
sir
but
he
says
to
tell
you
to
go
to
hell
sir
he
have
no
time
for
he
says
until
this
goddam
sag
is
through
or
the
juice
goes
off
sir
a
blast
of
profanity
erupted
from
the
speaker
of
such
violence
that
the
thoroughly
scared
wright
threw
the
down
the
and
in
the
same
instant
the
rotary
crashed
through
dazed
groggy
barely
conscious
from
his
terrific
effort
jones
stared
owlishly
through
the
heavy
lenses
of
his
helmet
while
the
timbermen
set
a
few
more
courses
of
wood
and
the
rotary
walked
itself
and
the
clinging
burley
up
and
out
of
the
hole
he
climbed
stiffly
out
and
as
he
stared
at
the
pillar
of
light
flaring
upward
from
the
sag
his
gorge
began
to
rise
wha
the
idea
of
that
damn
surveyor
lying
to
us
like
that
he
babbled
we
had
oodles
an
oodles
of
time
did
have
to
kill
ourselves
damn
water
ai
got
there
wha
the
big
he
wobbled
weakly
and
took
one
short
step
and
the
lights
went
out
the
surveyor
estimate
had
been
impossibly
accidentally
close
they
had
had
a
little
extra
time
but
it
was
measured
very
easily
in
seconds
and
jones
logical
to
the
end
in
a
queerly
addled
way
stood
in
the
almost
palpable
darkness
and
wobbled
and
thought
if
a
man
could
see
anything
with
his
eyes
wide
open
he
was
either
blind
or
unconscious
he
was
blind
therefore
he
must
be
unconscious
and
not
know
it
he
sighed
wearily
and
gratefully
and
collapsed
battery
lights
were
soon
reconnected
and
everybody
knew
that
they
had
holed
through
there
was
no
more
panic
and
even
before
the
had
recovered
full
consciousness
he
was
walking
down
the
drift
toward
station
eleven
there
is
no
need
to
enlarge
upon
the
rest
of
that
grim
and
grisly
affair
level
after
level
was
activated
and
since
working
upward
in
mines
is
vastly
faster
than
working
downward
the
two
parties
met
on
the
eighth
level
half
of
the
men
who
would
otherwise
have
died
were
saved
and
much
more
important
from
the
viewpoint
of
uranium
the
deeper
and
richer
half
of
the
biggest
and
richest
uranium
mine
in
existence
instead
of
being
out
of
production
for
a
year
or
more
would
be
back
in
full
operation
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
george
washington
jones
still
a
trifle
shaky
from
his
ordeal
was
called
into
the
front
office
but
before
he
arrived
i
going
to
make
him
assistant
works
manager
clancy
announced
i
think
not
but
listen
isaacson
how
do
you
expect
me
to
build
up
a
staff
if
you
snatch
every
good
man
i
find
away
from
me
you
did
find
him
birkenfeld
did
he
was
here
only
on
a
test
he
is
going
into
department
q
clancy
who
had
opened
his
mouth
to
continue
his
protests
shut
it
wordlessly
he
knew
that
department
q
was
department
q
chapter
costigan
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
man
he
had
known
as
birkenfeld
in
uranium
ornate
conference
room
he
had
not
expected
however
to
see
isaacson
he
knew
of
course
that
spaceways
owned
uranium
and
the
planet
eridan
lock
stock
and
barrel
but
it
never
entered
his
modest
mind
that
his
case
would
be
of
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
the
personal
attention
of
the
big
noise
himself
hence
the
sight
of
that
suave
and
unrevealing
face
gave
the
putative
jones
a
more
than
temporary
qualm
isaacson
was
stuff
out
of
his
class
virgil
samms
ought
to
be
taking
this
assignment
but
since
he
was
but
instead
of
being
an
inquisition
the
meeting
was
friendly
and
informal
from
the
start
they
complimented
him
upon
the
soundness
of
his
judgment
and
the
accuracy
of
his
decisions
they
thanked
him
both
with
words
and
with
a
considerable
sum
of
expendable
credits
they
encouraged
him
to
talk
about
himself
but
there
was
nothing
whatever
of
the
or
of
the
last
question
was
representative
of
the
whole
conference
one
other
thing
jones
has
me
slightly
baffled
isaacson
said
with
a
really
winning
smile
since
you
do
not
drink
and
since
you
were
not
in
search
of
feminine
er
companionship
just
why
did
you
go
down
to
roaring
jack
dive
two
reasons
jones
said
with
a
somewhat
shamefaced
grin
the
minor
one
is
easy
to
explain
but
well
i
had
been
having
an
exactly
easy
time
of
it
on
earth
you
all
know
about
that
i
suppose
they
knew
well
i
was
taking
a
very
dim
view
of
things
in
general
and
a
good
fight
would
get
it
out
of
my
system
it
always
does
i
see
and
the
major
reason
i
knew
of
course
that
i
was
on
probation
i
would
have
to
get
promoted
and
fast
or
stay
sunk
forever
to
get
promoted
fast
a
man
can
either
be
enough
of
a
to
be
pulled
up
from
on
high
or
he
can
be
shoved
up
by
the
men
he
is
working
with
the
best
way
to
get
a
crowd
of
men
to
like
you
is
to
lick
a
few
of
off
hours
of
course
and
according
to
hoyle
and
the
more
of
you
can
lick
at
once
the
better
i
pretty
good
at
brawling
so
i
gambled
that
the
cops
would
step
in
before
i
got
banged
up
too
much
i
won
i
see
isaacson
said
again
in
an
entirely
different
tone
he
did
see
now
the
first
technique
is
so
universally
used
that
the
possibility
of
the
second
did
not
occur
to
me
nice
work
nice
he
turned
to
the
other
members
of
the
board
this
i
believe
concludes
the
business
of
the
meeting
for
some
reason
or
other
isaacson
nodded
slightly
as
he
asked
the
question
and
one
by
one
as
though
in
concurrence
the
others
nodded
in
reply
the
meeting
broke
up
outside
the
door
however
the
magnate
did
not
go
about
his
own
business
nor
send
jones
about
his
instead
i
would
like
to
show
you
if
i
may
the
part
of
our
works
my
time
is
yours
sir
i
am
interested
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
go
into
the
details
of
a
greatest
uranium
operation
the
storage
bins
the
grinders
the
wilfley
tables
and
slime
tanks
the
flotation
sluices
the
roasters
and
reducers
the
processes
of
solution
and
crystallization
and
recrystallization
of
final
oxidation
and
reduction
suffice
it
to
say
that
isaacson
showed
jones
the
whole
immensity
of
uranium
works
number
one
the
trip
ended
on
the
top
floor
of
the
towering
administration
building
in
a
room
containing
a
desk
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
tremendously
massive
safe
smoke
up
isaacson
indicated
a
package
of
jones
favorite
brand
of
cigarettes
and
lighted
a
cigar
you
knew
that
you
were
under
test
i
wonder
though
if
you
knew
how
much
of
it
was
testing
all
of
it
jones
grinned
except
for
the
big
blow
of
course
of
course
there
were
too
many
possibilities
of
too
many
different
kinds
too
pat
i
might
warn
you
though
i
could
have
got
away
clear
with
that
the
possibility
existed
surprisingly
isaacson
did
not
tell
him
that
the
trap
was
more
subtle
than
it
had
appeared
to
be
it
was
however
worth
the
risk
why
did
you
because
i
figure
on
making
more
than
that
a
little
later
and
i
might
live
longer
to
spend
it
sound
thinking
my
boy
really
sound
now
you
noticed
of
course
the
vote
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
jones
had
noticed
it
and
although
he
did
not
say
so
he
had
been
wondering
about
it
ever
since
the
older
man
strolled
over
to
the
safe
and
opened
it
revealing
a
single
startlingly
small
package
you
passed
unanimously
you
are
now
learning
what
you
have
to
know
not
that
we
trust
you
unreservedly
you
will
be
watched
for
a
long
time
and
before
you
can
make
one
false
step
you
will
die
that
would
seem
to
be
good
business
sir
glad
you
look
at
it
that
way
we
thought
you
would
you
saw
the
works
quite
an
operation
do
you
think
immense
sir
the
biggest
thing
i
ever
saw
what
would
you
say
then
to
the
idea
of
this
office
being
our
real
headquarters
of
that
little
package
there
being
our
real
business
he
swung
the
safe
door
shut
spun
the
knob
it
would
have
been
highly
surprising
a
couple
of
hours
ago
costigan
could
not
afford
to
appear
stupid
nor
to
possess
too
much
knowledge
he
had
to
steer
an
extremely
difficult
middle
course
after
the
climax
of
this
though
it
would
seem
at
all
impossible
or
that
there
were
wheels
plenty
of
within
wheels
smart
isaacson
applauded
and
what
would
you
think
might
be
in
that
package
this
room
is
against
anything
the
galactic
patrol
can
swing
positively
well
then
it
be
something
beginning
with
the
letter
he
flicked
two
fingers
almost
invisibly
fast
into
a
t
and
went
on
without
a
break
m
as
in
morphine
your
caution
and
restraint
are
commendable
if
i
had
any
remaining
doubt
as
to
your
ability
it
is
gone
he
paused
frowning
as
belief
in
ability
increased
that
in
sincerity
lessened
this
doubt
this
questioning
existed
every
time
a
new
executive
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
department
q
the
board
judgment
was
good
they
had
slipped
only
twice
and
those
two
errors
had
been
corrected
easily
enough
the
fellow
had
been
warned
once
that
was
enough
he
took
the
plunge
you
will
work
with
the
assistant
works
manager
here
until
you
understand
the
duties
of
the
position
you
will
be
transferred
to
tellus
as
assistant
works
manager
there
your
principal
duties
will
however
be
concerned
with
department
q
which
you
will
head
up
one
day
if
you
make
good
and
just
incidentally
when
you
go
to
tellus
a
package
like
that
one
in
the
safe
will
go
with
you
oh
i
see
i
make
good
sir
jones
let
isaacson
see
his
tighten
in
resolve
it
may
take
a
little
time
for
me
to
learn
my
way
around
sir
but
i
learn
it
i
sure
you
will
and
now
to
go
into
greater
detail
virgil
samms
had
to
be
sure
of
his
facts
more
than
that
he
had
to
be
able
to
prove
them
not
merely
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
officer
but
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
of
the
member
of
a
cynical
and
skeptical
jury
wherefore
jack
kinnison
and
mase
northrop
took
up
the
thionite
trail
at
the
exact
point
where
each
trip
george
olmstead
had
had
to
abandon
it
in
the
atmosphere
of
cavenda
and
fortunately
not
too
much
preparation
was
required
cavenda
was
as
has
been
intimated
a
primitive
world
its
native
people
humanoid
in
type
had
developed
a
culture
approximating
in
some
respects
that
of
the
north
american
indian
at
about
the
time
of
columbus
in
others
that
of
the
ancient
nomads
of
araby
thus
a
couple
of
wandering
natives
unrecognizable
under
their
dirty
stormproof
blankets
and
their
scarcely
thinner
layers
of
grease
and
grime
watched
impassively
incuriously
while
a
box
floated
pendant
from
its
parachute
from
sky
to
ground
mounted
upon
their
uncouth
steeds
they
followed
that
box
when
it
was
hauled
to
the
white
man
village
unlike
many
of
the
other
natives
these
two
did
not
shuffle
into
that
village
to
lean
silently
against
a
rock
or
a
wall
awaiting
their
turns
to
exchange
a
few
hours
of
simple
labor
for
a
container
of
a
new
and
highly
potent
beverage
they
did
however
keep
themselves
constantly
and
minutely
informed
as
to
everything
these
strange
white
men
did
one
of
these
wandered
off
into
the
wilderness
two
or
three
days
before
the
huge
left
ground
the
other
immediately
afterward
thus
the
departure
of
the
from
cavenda
was
recorded
as
was
its
arrival
at
eridan
it
had
been
extremely
difficult
for
the
engineers
to
devise
ways
and
means
of
tracing
that
ship
from
departure
to
arrival
without
exciting
suspicion
but
it
had
not
proved
impossible
and
jack
kinnison
lounging
idly
and
elegantly
in
the
concourse
of
danopolis
spaceport
seethed
imperceptibly
having
swallowed
a
tiny
service
special
capsule
that
morning
he
knew
that
he
had
been
under
continuous
inspection
for
over
two
hours
he
had
not
given
himself
away
practically
everybody
screened
their
inside
coat
pockets
and
hip
pockets
and
the
lead
from
lens
to
leg
simply
could
not
be
seen
but
for
all
the
good
they
were
doing
him
his
might
just
as
well
have
been
back
on
tellus
mase
he
sent
with
no
change
whatever
in
the
vapid
expression
then
on
his
face
i
still
covered
are
you
covered
the
answering
thought
was
a
snort
they
covering
me
like
water
covers
a
submarine
keep
tuned
i
call
spud
spud
come
in
jack
conway
costigan
alone
now
in
the
sanctum
of
department
q
did
not
seem
to
be
busy
but
he
was
that
red
herring
they
told
us
to
drag
across
the
trail
was
too
damned
red
they
must
be
touchier
than
fulminate
to
on
their
armed
forces
neither
mase
nor
i
can
do
a
lick
of
work
anybody
else
covered
no
all
clear
good
tell
them
the
zwilnik
blockers
took
us
out
i
do
that
distance
only
or
is
somebody
on
your
tail
somebody
and
i
mean
a
slick
chick
with
a
classy
chassis
a
blonde
with
great
big
eyes
too
good
to
be
true
especially
the
falsies
wiring
my
friend
and
i
have
been
able
to
get
a
close
look
but
i
would
wonder
if
her
nostrils
had
a
skillionth
of
a
whillimeter
too
much
expansion
i
want
a
op
is
it
safe
to
use
fred
kinnison
referred
to
the
grizzled
engineer
now
puttering
about
in
a
certain
not
the
one
in
which
he
and
northrop
had
come
to
eridan
definitely
not
i
can
do
it
myself
and
still
stay
very
much
in
character
no
i
do
know
her
not
surprising
of
course
since
the
policy
here
is
never
to
let
the
right
hand
know
what
the
left
is
doing
how
about
you
mase
have
you
got
a
little
too
yea
verily
brother
but
not
little
more
my
size
northrop
pointed
out
a
tall
trim
brunette
strolling
along
with
the
effortless
consciously
unconscious
poise
of
the
professional
model
hm
m
i
do
know
her
either
costigan
reported
but
both
of
them
are
wearing
blocks
and
are
probably
wired
up
like
christmas
trees
by
inference
proof
i
penetrate
of
course
but
maybe
i
can
get
a
viewpoint
you
right
jack
nostrils
plugged
in
fact
i
spread
their
pictures
around
and
see
if
anybody
knows
either
of
them
he
did
so
and
over
a
hundred
of
the
patrol
shrewdest
operatives
upon
this
occasion
north
america
had
invaded
eridan
in
force
studied
and
thought
no
one
knew
the
tall
brunette
but
i
know
the
blonde
this
was
parker
of
washington
a
service
ace
for
twenty
five
years
hazel
deforce
the
babe
unhung
watch
your
step
around
her
she
just
as
handy
with
a
knife
and
drops
as
she
is
with
a
gun
thanks
parker
i
heard
of
her
costigan
was
thinking
fast
no
way
of
telling
who
she
working
for
at
the
moment
this
was
a
statement
not
a
question
only
that
it
would
have
to
be
somebody
with
a
lot
of
money
her
price
is
high
that
all
that
all
fellows
then
to
jack
and
northrop
my
thought
is
that
you
two
guys
are
completely
and
undressed
you
sitting
ducks
and
if
you
put
out
any
screens
it
crystallize
their
suspicions
and
grab
you
right
then
or
maybe
even
knock
you
off
you
better
get
out
of
here
at
full
blast
you
ca
do
any
more
good
here
the
way
things
are
sure
we
can
kinnison
protested
you
wanted
a
diversion
did
you
yes
but
you
already
what
we
done
already
is
a
patch
to
what
we
can
do
next
we
can
set
up
such
a
diversion
that
the
boys
can
walk
right
on
the
heels
without
anybody
paying
any
attention
by
the
way
you
do
know
yet
who
is
going
to
carry
it
do
you
no
no
penetration
at
all
you
soon
will
bucko
watch
our
smoke
what
do
you
think
you
going
to
do
costigan
demanded
sharply
this
jack
explained
and
do
try
to
say
no
we
on
our
own
you
know
we
l
l
it
sounds
good
and
if
you
can
pull
it
off
it
will
help
no
end
go
ahead
the
demurely
luscious
blonde
stared
disconsolately
at
the
bulletin
board
upon
which
another
thirty
minutes
was
being
added
to
the
time
of
arrival
of
a
ship
already
three
hours
late
she
picked
up
a
book
glanced
at
its
cover
put
it
down
her
hand
moved
toward
a
magazine
drew
back
dropped
idly
into
her
lap
she
sighed
stifled
a
yawn
prettily
leaned
backward
in
her
seat
in
such
a
position
jack
noticed
that
he
could
not
see
into
her
nostrils
and
closed
her
eyes
and
jack
kinnison
coming
visibly
to
a
decision
sat
down
beside
her
pardon
me
miss
but
i
feel
just
like
you
look
can
you
tell
me
why
convention
decrees
that
two
people
stuck
in
this
concourse
by
arrivals
that
nobody
knows
when
will
arrive
have
got
to
suffer
alone
when
they
could
have
so
much
more
fun
suffering
together
the
girl
eyes
opened
slowly
she
was
neither
startled
nor
afraid
nor
it
seemed
even
interested
in
fact
she
gazed
at
him
with
so
much
disinterest
and
for
so
long
a
time
that
he
began
to
wonder
was
she
going
to
play
sweet
and
innocent
to
the
end
yes
conventions
stupid
sometimes
she
admitted
finally
her
lovely
lips
curving
into
the
beginnings
of
a
smile
her
voice
low
and
sweet
matched
perfectly
the
rest
of
her
charming
self
after
all
perfectly
nice
people
do
meet
informally
on
shipboard
why
not
in
concourses
why
not
indeed
and
i
perfectly
nice
people
i
assure
you
willi
borden
is
the
name
my
friends
call
me
bill
and
you
beatrice
bailey
bee
for
short
tell
me
what
you
like
and
we
talk
about
it
why
talk
when
we
could
be
eating
i
with
a
guy
he
out
on
the
field
somewhere
a
big
bruiser
with
a
black
mustache
maybe
you
saw
him
talking
to
me
a
while
back
i
think
so
now
that
you
mention
him
too
big
too
big
the
girl
spoke
carelessly
but
managed
to
make
it
very
clear
that
jack
kinnison
was
just
exactly
the
right
size
why
i
told
him
i
have
supper
with
him
shall
we
hunt
him
up
and
eat
together
why
not
is
he
alone
he
was
when
i
saw
him
last
although
jack
knew
exactly
where
northrop
was
and
who
was
with
him
he
had
to
play
safe
he
did
not
know
how
much
this
bee
bailey
really
knew
he
knows
a
lot
more
people
around
here
than
i
do
though
so
maybe
he
is
now
let
me
carry
some
of
that
plunder
you
might
carry
those
books
thanks
but
the
field
is
so
how
do
you
expect
to
find
him
or
do
you
know
where
he
is
he
denied
vigorously
this
was
the
critical
moment
she
certainly
was
suspicious
yet
but
she
was
showing
signs
of
not
wanting
to
go
out
there
and
if
she
refused
to
go
to
be
honest
i
do
care
whether
i
find
him
or
not
the
idea
of
ditching
him
appeals
to
me
more
and
more
so
how
about
this
we
dash
out
to
the
third
dock
just
so
i
wo
have
to
actually
lie
about
looking
for
him
and
dash
right
back
here
or
would
you
rather
have
it
a
twosome
i
refuse
to
answer
by
advice
of
counsel
the
girl
laughed
gaily
but
her
answer
was
plain
enough
their
rate
of
progress
was
by
no
means
a
dash
and
kinnison
did
not
look
with
his
eyes
for
northrop
nevertheless
just
south
of
the
third
dock
the
two
young
couples
met
my
cousin
grace
james
northrop
said
without
a
tremor
or
a
quiver
wild
willi
borden
grace
usually
called
baldy
on
account
of
his
hair
the
girls
were
introduced
each
vouchsafing
the
other
a
completely
meaningless
smile
and
a
colorlessly
conventional
word
of
greeting
were
they
in
fact
as
in
seeming
total
strangers
or
were
they
in
fact
working
together
as
closely
as
were
the
two
young
lensmen
themselves
if
that
was
acting
it
was
a
beautiful
job
neither
man
could
detect
the
slightest
flaw
in
the
performance
of
either
girl
whither
away
pilot
jack
allowed
no
lapse
of
time
you
know
all
the
places
around
here
lead
us
to
a
good
one
this
way
my
old
and
fragrant
fruit
northrop
led
off
with
a
flourish
and
again
jack
tensed
the
walk
led
straight
past
the
apparently
deserted
dock
of
which
a
certain
vessel
was
the
only
occupant
if
nothing
happened
for
fifteen
more
seconds
nothing
did
the
laughing
chattering
four
came
abreast
of
the
portal
the
door
swung
open
and
the
lensmen
went
into
action
they
did
not
like
to
women
but
speed
was
their
first
consideration
with
safety
a
close
second
and
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
to
make
speed
while
carrying
a
conscious
lithe
strong
woman
in
such
a
position
that
she
can
not
use
fists
feet
teeth
gun
or
knife
an
unconscious
woman
on
the
other
hand
can
be
carried
easily
and
safely
enough
therefore
jack
spun
his
partner
around
forced
both
of
her
hands
into
one
of
his
the
free
hand
flashed
upward
toward
the
neck
a
hard
finger
pressed
unerringly
against
a
nerve
the
girl
went
limp
the
two
victims
were
hustled
aboard
and
the
surrounded
now
by
screen
took
off
kinnison
paid
no
attention
to
ship
or
course
orders
had
been
given
long
since
and
would
be
carried
out
instead
he
lowered
his
burden
to
the
floor
spread
her
out
flat
and
sought
out
and
removed
item
after
item
of
wiring
apparatus
and
offensive
and
defensive
armament
he
did
not
undress
her
quite
but
he
made
completely
certain
that
the
only
weapons
left
to
the
young
lady
were
those
with
which
nature
had
endowed
her
and
northrop
having
taken
care
of
his
alleged
cousin
with
equal
thoroughness
the
were
sent
out
and
both
doors
of
the
room
were
securely
locked
now
hazel
deforce
kinnison
said
conversationally
you
can
snap
out
of
it
any
time
you
been
back
to
normal
for
at
least
two
minutes
you
found
out
that
your
famous
wo
work
there
nothing
loose
you
can
grab
and
you
too
smart
an
operator
to
tackle
me
who
the
captain
of
your
team
you
or
the
the
statuesque
brunette
exclaimed
but
her
protests
were
drowned
out
the
blonde
could
and
did
talk
louder
faster
and
rougher
do
you
think
you
can
get
away
with
she
demanded
why
you
and
the
unexpurgated
trenchant
brilliantly
detailed
characterization
could
have
seared
its
way
through
asbestos
and
just
what
do
you
think
you
going
to
do
with
me
as
to
the
first
i
think
so
kinnison
replied
ignoring
the
verbiage
as
to
the
second
as
of
now
i
do
know
what
would
you
do
if
our
situations
were
reversed
i
blast
you
to
a
cinder
or
else
take
a
knife
and
hazel
the
brunette
cautioned
sharply
careful
you
touch
them
off
and
they
shut
up
jane
they
wo
hurt
us
any
more
than
they
have
already
it
psychologically
impossible
is
that
true
copper
hazel
lighted
a
cigarette
inhaled
deeply
and
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
at
kinnison
face
pretty
much
so
i
guess
the
lensman
admitted
frankly
enough
but
we
can
put
you
away
for
the
rest
of
your
lives
or
do
you
think
i
am
she
sneered
what
would
you
use
for
a
case
we
as
safe
as
if
we
were
in
god
pocket
and
besides
our
positions
be
reversed
pretty
quick
you
may
not
know
it
but
the
fastest
ships
in
space
are
chasing
us
right
now
for
once
you
wrong
we
got
plenty
of
legs
ourselves
and
blasting
for
rendezvous
with
a
but
enough
of
this
chatter
i
want
to
know
what
job
you
on
and
why
you
picked
on
us
give
oh
does
hazel
cooed
venomously
come
and
sit
on
mama
lap
itty
bitty
soldier
boy
and
she
tell
you
everything
you
want
to
know
both
lensmen
probed
then
with
everything
they
had
but
learned
nothing
of
value
the
women
did
not
know
what
the
patrolmen
were
trying
to
do
but
they
were
so
intensely
hostile
that
their
mental
blocks
unconscious
although
they
were
were
as
effective
as
thought
screens
against
the
most
insidious
approaches
the
men
could
make
anything
in
their
mase
jack
asked
finally
i
look
nothing
much
just
this
and
the
very
tonelessness
of
northrop
voice
made
jack
look
up
quickly
just
a
letter
from
the
hazel
shrugged
her
shoulders
nothing
hot
not
even
warm
go
ahead
and
read
it
not
interested
in
what
it
says
but
it
might
be
smart
to
develop
it
envelope
and
all
for
invisible
ink
and
whatnot
he
did
so
deeming
it
a
expenditure
of
time
he
already
knew
what
the
hidden
message
was
but
no
one
not
of
the
patrol
should
know
that
no
transmission
of
intelligence
however
coded
or
garbled
or
disguised
or
by
whatever
means
sent
could
be
concealed
from
any
wearer
of
lens
listen
hazel
kinnison
said
holding
up
the
now
slightly
stained
paper
six
two
that
you
i
suppose
and
you
the
squad
leader
mentioned
previously
being
investigated
stop
assign
three
nine
eight
that
must
be
you
jane
make
acquaintance
stop
if
no
further
instructions
received
by
eighteen
hundred
hours
liquidate
immediately
stop
party
one
the
blond
operative
lost
for
the
first
time
her
brazen
control
why
that
code
is
she
gasped
wrong
again
gentle
alice
some
of
us
are
specialists
he
directed
a
thought
at
northrop
this
changes
things
slightly
mase
i
was
going
to
turn
them
loose
but
now
i
do
know
better
we
take
it
up
with
the
boss
do
you
think
samms
was
called
and
considered
the
matter
for
approximately
one
minute
your
first
idea
was
right
jack
let
them
go
the
message
may
be
helpful
and
informative
but
the
women
would
not
they
know
nothing
congratulations
boys
on
the
complete
success
of
operation
red
herring
ouch
jack
grimaced
mentally
to
his
partner
after
the
first
lensman
had
cut
off
they
know
enough
to
be
in
on
bumping
you
and
me
off
but
that
ai
important
says
he
and
it
ai
bub
northrop
grinned
back
moderately
so
maybe
if
they
had
got
us
but
not
at
all
so
now
they
ca
the
lensmen
have
landed
and
the
situation
is
well
in
hand
it
is
written
selah
check
let
wrap
it
up
jack
turned
to
the
blonde
come
on
hazel
out
number
four
lifeboat
do
you
want
to
come
peaceably
or
shall
i
work
on
your
neck
again
you
could
think
of
other
places
that
would
be
more
fun
she
got
up
and
stared
directly
into
his
eyes
her
lip
curling
that
is
if
you
were
a
instead
of
a
sublimated
boy
scout
kinnison
without
a
word
wheeled
and
unlocked
a
door
hazel
swaggered
forward
but
the
taller
girl
hung
back
are
you
sure
there
air
and
they
pick
us
up
maybe
they
going
to
make
us
breathe
space
huh
they
have
got
the
guts
hazel
sneered
come
on
jane
number
four
you
said
darling
she
led
the
way
kinnison
opened
the
portal
jane
hurried
aboard
but
hazel
paused
and
held
out
her
arms
are
you
even
going
to
kiss
mama
goodbye
baby
boy
she
taunted
better
not
waste
much
more
time
we
blow
this
boat
sealed
or
open
in
fifteen
seconds
by
what
effort
kinnison
held
his
voice
level
and
expressionless
he
hoped
the
wench
would
never
know
she
looked
at
him
started
to
say
something
looked
again
she
had
gone
just
about
as
far
as
it
was
safe
to
go
she
stepped
into
the
boat
and
reached
for
the
lever
and
as
the
valve
was
swinging
smoothly
shut
the
men
heard
a
tinkling
laugh
reminiscent
of
icicles
breaking
against
steel
bells
hell
brazen
hinges
kinnison
wiped
his
forehead
as
the
lifeboat
shot
away
hazel
was
something
brand
new
to
him
a
phenomenon
with
which
none
of
his
education
training
or
experience
had
equipped
him
to
cope
i
heard
about
the
guy
who
got
hold
of
a
tiger
by
the
tail
but
his
thought
expired
on
a
wondering
confused
note
yeah
northrop
was
in
no
better
case
we
won
technically
i
guess
or
did
we
that
was
a
drubbing
we
took
mister
well
we
got
away
alive
anyway
we
tell
parker
his
dope
is
correct
to
the
proverbial
twenty
decimals
and
now
that
we
escaped
let
call
spud
and
see
how
things
came
out
and
assured
them
that
everything
had
come
out
very
well
indeed
the
shipment
of
thionite
had
been
followed
without
any
difficulty
at
all
from
the
clear
through
to
jones
own
office
and
it
reposed
now
in
department
q
own
safe
under
personal
watch
and
ward
the
pressure
had
lightened
tremendously
just
as
kinnison
and
northrop
had
thought
it
would
when
they
set
up
their
diversion
costigan
listened
impassively
to
the
whole
story
now
i
have
shot
her
or
not
jack
demanded
not
whether
i
have
or
not
i
could
but
i
have
spud
i
do
know
costigan
thought
for
minutes
i
do
think
so
no
not
in
cold
blood
i
could
have
either
and
would
if
i
could
it
would
be
worth
it
somebody
will
shoot
her
some
day
but
not
one
of
us
unless
of
course
it
in
a
fight
thanks
spud
that
makes
me
feel
better
off
desk
was
already
clear
since
there
was
little
or
no
connected
with
his
position
in
department
q
hence
his
preparations
for
departure
were
few
and
simple
he
merely
opened
the
safe
stuck
the
package
into
his
pocket
closed
and
locked
the
safe
and
took
a
company
to
the
spaceport
nor
was
there
any
more
formality
about
his
leaving
the
planet
eridan
had
of
course
a
customs
frontier
of
sorts
but
since
uranium
owned
eridan
in
fee
simple
its
customs
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
company
ships
or
to
company
men
nor
did
jones
need
ticket
passport
or
visa
company
men
rode
company
ships
to
and
from
company
plants
wherever
situated
without
let
or
hindrance
thus
wearing
the
aura
of
power
of
his
new
position
and
gold
badge
number
thirty
eight
george
jones
was
whisked
out
to
the
uranium
ship
and
was
shown
to
his
cabin
nor
was
it
surprising
that
the
trip
from
eridan
to
earth
was
completely
without
incident
this
was
an
ordinary
freighter
hauling
uranium
on
a
routine
flight
her
cargo
was
valuable
of
course
the
sine
qua
non
of
trade
but
in
no
sense
precious
not
by
any
means
and
only
two
men
knew
that
this
flight
was
in
any
whit
different
from
the
one
which
had
preceded
it
or
the
one
which
would
follow
it
if
this
ship
was
escorted
or
guarded
the
fact
was
not
apparent
and
no
patrol
vessel
came
nearer
to
it
than
four
detets
virgil
samms
and
roderick
kinnison
saw
to
that
the
voyage
however
was
not
tedious
jones
was
busy
every
minute
in
fact
there
were
scarcely
minutes
enough
in
which
to
assimilate
the
material
which
isaacson
had
given
him
the
layouts
and
organization
charts
of
works
number
eighteen
on
tellus
and
upon
arrival
at
the
private
spaceport
which
was
an
integral
part
of
works
number
eighteen
jones
was
not
surprised
he
knew
more
now
than
he
had
known
a
few
weeks
before
and
infinitely
more
than
the
man
on
the
street
to
learn
that
the
customs
men
of
this
particular
north
american
port
of
entry
were
just
as
complaisant
as
were
those
of
eridan
they
did
not
bother
even
to
count
the
boxes
to
say
nothing
of
inspecting
them
they
stamped
the
ship
papers
without
either
reading
or
checking
them
they
made
a
perfunctory
search
it
is
true
of
crewmen
and
quarters
but
a
low
number
gold
badge
was
still
a
magic
talisman
unquestioned
sacrosanct
he
and
his
baggage
were
escorted
to
the
first
in
line
administration
building
told
the
hacker
and
that
was
that
chapter
it
has
been
said
that
the
basic
drive
of
the
eddorians
was
a
lust
for
power
a
thought
which
should
be
elucidated
and
perhaps
slightly
modified
their
warrings
their
strifes
their
internecine
intrigues
and
connivings
were
inevitable
because
of
the
tremendousness
and
capability
and
the
limitations
of
their
minds
not
enough
occur
upon
any
one
planet
to
keep
such
minds
as
theirs
even
partially
occupied
and
unlike
the
arisians
they
could
not
satiate
themselves
in
a
static
philosophical
study
of
the
infinite
possibilities
of
the
cosmic
all
they
had
to
be
something
or
better
yet
making
other
and
lesser
beings
do
things
to
make
the
physical
universe
conform
to
their
idea
of
what
a
universe
should
be
their
first
care
was
to
set
up
the
various
echelons
of
control
the
second
echelon
immediately
below
the
masters
was
of
course
the
most
important
and
after
a
survey
of
both
galaxies
they
decided
to
give
this
high
honor
to
the
ploorans
ploor
as
is
now
well
known
was
a
planet
of
a
sun
so
variable
that
all
plooran
life
had
to
undergo
radical
cyclical
changes
in
physical
form
in
order
to
live
through
the
tremendous
climatic
changes
involved
in
its
every
year
physical
form
however
meant
nothing
to
the
eddorians
since
no
other
planet
even
remotely
like
theirs
existed
in
this
our
normal
plenum
physiques
like
theirs
would
be
impossible
and
the
plooran
mentality
left
very
little
to
be
desired
in
the
third
echelon
there
were
many
different
races
among
which
the
eich
were
perhaps
the
most
efficient
and
most
callous
and
in
the
fourth
there
were
millions
upon
millions
of
entities
representing
thousands
upon
thousands
of
races
thus
at
the
pinpoint
in
history
represented
by
the
time
of
virgil
samms
and
roderick
kinnison
the
eddorians
were
busy
and
if
such
a
word
can
be
used
happy
gharlane
of
eddore
second
in
authority
only
to
the
his
ultimate
supremacy
himself
paid
little
attention
to
any
one
planet
or
to
any
one
race
even
such
a
mind
as
his
when
directing
the
affairs
of
twenty
million
and
then
sixty
million
and
then
a
hundred
million
worlds
can
do
so
only
in
broad
and
not
in
fine
and
thus
the
reports
which
were
now
flooding
in
to
gharlane
in
a
constantly
increasing
stream
concerned
classes
and
groups
of
worlds
and
solar
systems
and
galactic
regions
a
planet
might
perhaps
be
mentioned
as
representative
of
a
class
but
no
individual
entity
lower
than
a
plooran
was
named
or
discussed
gharlane
analyzed
those
tremendous
reports
collated
digested
compared
and
reconciled
them
determined
trends
and
tendencies
and
most
probable
resultants
gharlane
issued
orders
the
carrying
out
of
which
would
make
an
entire
galactic
region
fit
more
and
ever
more
exactly
into
the
great
plan
but
as
has
been
pointed
out
there
was
one
flaw
inherent
in
the
boskonian
system
underlings
then
as
now
were
prone
to
gloss
over
their
own
mistakes
to
cover
up
their
own
incompetences
thus
since
he
had
no
reason
to
inquire
specifically
gharlane
did
not
know
that
anything
whatever
had
gone
amiss
on
sol
three
the
pestiferous
planet
which
had
formerly
caused
him
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
of
his
worlds
combined
after
the
fact
it
is
easy
to
say
that
he
should
have
continued
his
personal
supervision
of
earth
but
can
that
view
be
defended
egotistical
arrogant
gharlane
that
he
had
finally
whipped
tellus
into
line
it
was
the
same
now
as
any
other
planet
of
its
class
and
even
had
he
thought
it
worth
while
to
make
such
a
glaring
exception
would
not
the
fused
elders
of
arisia
have
intervened
be
those
things
as
they
may
gharlane
did
not
know
that
the
galactic
patrol
had
been
successful
in
defending
triplanetary
hill
against
the
black
fleet
nor
did
the
plooran
assistant
director
in
charge
nor
did
any
member
of
that
dreadful
group
of
eich
which
was
even
then
calling
itself
the
council
of
boskone
the
boskonian
who
knew
of
the
fiasco
calmly
confident
of
his
own
ability
had
not
considered
this
minor
reverse
of
sufficient
importance
to
report
to
his
immediate
superior
he
had
already
taken
steps
to
correct
the
condition
in
fact
as
matters
now
stood
the
thing
was
more
fortunate
than
otherwise
in
that
it
would
lull
the
patrol
into
believing
themselves
in
a
position
of
superiority
a
belief
which
would
at
election
time
prove
fatal
this
being
human
to
the
limit
of
classification
except
for
a
faint
but
unmistakable
blue
coloration
had
been
closeted
with
senator
morgan
for
a
matter
of
two
hours
in
the
matters
covered
your
reports
have
been
complete
and
conclusive
the
visitor
said
finally
but
you
have
not
reported
on
the
lens
purposely
we
are
investigating
it
but
any
report
based
upon
our
present
knowledge
would
be
partial
and
inconclusive
i
see
commendable
enough
usually
news
of
this
phenomenon
has
however
gone
farther
and
higher
than
you
think
and
i
have
been
ordered
to
take
cognizance
of
it
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
handle
it
myself
i
am
thoroughly
capable
of
i
will
decide
that
not
you
morgan
subsided
a
partial
report
is
therefore
in
order
go
ahead
according
to
the
procedure
submitted
and
approved
a
lensman
was
taken
alive
since
the
lens
has
telepathic
properties
and
hence
is
presumably
operative
at
great
distances
the
operation
was
carried
out
in
the
shortest
possible
time
the
lens
immediately
upon
removal
from
the
patrolman
arm
ceased
to
radiate
and
the
operative
who
held
the
thing
died
it
was
then
applied
by
force
to
four
other
men
workers
these
of
no
importance
all
four
died
thus
obviating
all
possibility
of
coincidence
an
attempt
was
made
to
analyze
a
fragment
of
the
active
material
without
success
it
seemed
to
be
completely
inert
neither
was
it
affected
by
electrical
discharges
or
by
bombardment
nor
by
any
temperatures
available
meanwhile
the
man
was
of
course
being
questioned
under
and
beams
his
mind
denied
any
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
lens
a
thing
which
i
am
rather
inclined
to
believe
his
mind
adhered
to
the
belief
that
he
obtained
the
lens
upon
the
planet
arisia
i
am
offering
for
your
consideration
my
opinion
that
the
officers
of
the
patrol
are
using
hypnotism
to
conceal
the
real
source
of
the
lens
your
opinion
is
accepted
for
consideration
the
man
died
during
examination
two
minutes
after
his
death
his
lens
disappeared
disappeared
what
do
you
mean
flew
away
vanished
was
stolen
disintegrated
or
what
no
more
like
evaporation
or
sublimation
except
that
there
was
no
gradual
diminution
in
volume
and
there
was
no
detectable
residue
either
solid
liquid
or
gaseous
the
bracelet
remained
intact
and
then
the
patrol
attacked
in
force
and
our
expedition
was
destroyed
you
are
sure
of
these
observational
facts
i
have
the
detailed
records
would
you
like
to
see
them
send
them
to
my
office
i
hereby
relieve
you
of
all
responsibility
in
the
matter
of
the
lens
in
fact
even
i
may
decide
to
refer
it
to
a
higher
echelon
have
you
any
other
material
not
necessarily
facts
which
may
have
bearing
none
morgan
replied
and
it
was
just
as
well
for
virgilia
continued
that
the
senator
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
mention
the
traceless
disappearance
of
his
number
one
secretary
and
a
few
members
of
a
certain
unsavory
gang
to
his
way
of
thinking
the
lens
was
not
involved
except
perhaps
very
incidentally
herkimer
in
spite
of
advice
and
orders
had
probably
got
rough
with
the
girl
and
samms
mob
had
rubbed
him
out
served
him
right
i
have
no
criticism
of
any
phase
of
your
work
you
are
doing
a
particularly
nice
job
on
thionite
you
are
of
course
observing
all
specified
precautions
as
to
key
personnel
certainly
thorough
testing
and
unremitting
watchfulness
our
isaacson
is
about
to
promote
a
man
who
has
proved
very
capable
would
you
like
to
observe
the
proceedings
no
i
have
no
time
for
minor
matters
your
results
have
been
satisfactory
keep
them
that
way
the
visitor
strode
out
morgan
reached
for
a
switch
then
drew
his
hand
back
no
he
would
like
to
sit
in
on
the
forthcoming
interview
but
he
did
not
have
the
time
he
had
tested
olmstead
repeatedly
and
personally
he
knew
what
the
man
was
it
was
isaacson
department
let
isaacson
handle
it
he
himself
must
work
full
time
at
the
job
which
only
he
could
handle
the
nationalists
must
and
would
win
this
forthcoming
election
and
in
the
office
of
the
president
of
interstellar
spaceways
isaacson
got
up
and
shook
hands
with
george
olmstead
i
called
you
in
for
two
reasons
first
in
reply
to
your
message
that
you
were
ready
for
a
bigger
job
what
makes
you
think
that
any
such
are
available
do
i
need
to
answer
that
perhaps
not
no
the
magnate
smiled
quietly
morgan
was
right
this
man
could
not
be
accused
of
being
dumb
there
is
such
a
job
you
are
ready
for
it
and
you
have
your
successor
trained
in
the
work
of
harvesting
second
why
did
you
cut
down
instead
of
increasing
as
ordered
the
weight
of
broadleaf
per
trip
this
olmstead
is
really
serious
i
explained
why
it
would
have
been
more
serious
the
other
way
you
believe
i
knew
what
i
was
talking
about
your
reasoning
may
have
been
distorted
in
transmittal
i
want
it
straight
from
you
very
well
it
is
smart
to
be
greedy
there
a
point
at
which
something
that
has
been
merely
a
nuisance
becomes
a
thing
that
to
be
wiped
out
since
i
did
want
to
be
in
that
ferry
when
the
patrol
blows
it
out
of
the
ether
i
cut
down
the
take
and
i
advise
you
to
keep
it
down
what
you
getting
now
is
a
lot
more
than
you
ever
got
before
and
a
of
a
lot
more
than
none
at
all
think
it
over
i
see
upon
what
basis
did
you
arrive
at
the
figure
you
established
pure
guesswork
nothing
else
i
guessed
that
about
three
hundred
percent
of
the
previous
average
per
month
ought
to
satisfy
anybody
who
was
too
greedy
to
have
good
sense
and
that
more
than
that
would
ring
a
loud
clear
bell
right
where
we
do
want
any
noise
made
so
i
cut
it
down
to
three
and
advised
ferdy
either
to
keep
it
at
three
or
quit
while
he
was
still
all
in
one
piece
you
exceeded
your
authority
and
were
insubordinate
but
it
would
surprise
me
if
you
were
right
you
are
certainly
right
in
principle
and
the
poundage
can
be
determined
by
statistical
and
psychological
analysis
but
in
the
meantime
there
is
tremendous
pressure
for
increased
production
i
know
it
pressure
be
damned
my
dear
cousin
virgil
is
as
you
already
know
a
crackpot
he
is
visionary
idealistic
full
of
sweet
and
beautiful
concepts
of
what
the
universe
would
be
like
if
there
were
so
many
people
like
you
and
me
in
it
but
do
ever
make
the
mistake
of
writing
him
off
as
anybody
fool
and
you
know
probably
better
than
i
do
what
rod
kinnison
is
like
if
i
were
you
i
tell
whoever
is
doing
the
screaming
to
shut
their
damn
mouths
before
they
get
their
teeth
kicked
down
their
throats
i
very
much
inclined
to
take
your
advice
and
now
as
to
this
proposed
promotion
you
are
of
course
familiar
in
a
general
way
with
our
operation
at
northport
i
could
scarcely
help
knowing
about
the
biggest
uranium
works
on
earth
however
i
am
not
well
enough
qualified
in
detail
to
make
a
good
technical
executive
nor
is
it
necessary
our
thought
is
to
make
you
a
key
man
in
a
new
and
increasingly
important
branch
of
the
business
known
as
department
q
it
is
concerned
neither
with
production
nor
with
uranium
q
as
in
eh
i
listening
with
both
ears
what
duties
would
be
connected
with
this
er
position
what
would
i
really
do
two
pairs
of
hard
eyes
locked
and
held
staring
yieldlessly
into
each
other
depths
you
would
not
be
unduly
surprised
to
learn
that
substances
other
than
uranium
occasionally
reach
northport
not
surprised
no
olmstead
replied
dryly
what
would
i
do
with
it
we
need
not
go
into
that
here
or
now
i
offer
you
the
position
i
accept
it
very
well
i
will
take
you
to
northport
and
we
will
continue
our
talk
en
route
and
in
a
compartment
of
a
stratoliner
they
did
so
just
for
my
information
isaacson
how
many
predecessors
have
i
had
on
this
particular
job
and
what
happened
to
them
the
patrol
get
them
two
no
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
evidence
that
the
samms
crowd
has
any
suspicion
of
us
both
were
too
small
for
the
job
neither
could
handle
personnel
one
got
funny
ideas
the
other
could
stand
the
strain
if
you
do
get
funny
ideas
and
do
crack
up
you
will
make
out
in
a
big
and
i
mean
big
way
if
i
do
either
i
be
more
than
somewhat
surprised
features
set
themselves
into
a
mirthless
uncompromising
somehow
bitter
grin
so
will
i
isaacson
agreed
he
knew
what
this
man
was
and
just
how
he
was
he
knew
that
he
had
fought
morgan
himself
to
a
scoreless
tie
after
twisting
herkimer
and
he
was
no
soft
touch
into
a
pretzel
in
nothing
flat
at
the
thought
of
the
secretary
so
recently
and
so
mysteriously
vanished
the
magnate
mind
left
for
a
moment
the
matter
in
hand
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
that
affair
the
lens
or
the
woman
or
both
if
he
were
in
morgan
shoes
but
he
was
he
had
enough
grief
of
his
own
without
worrying
about
any
of
morgan
stinkeroos
he
studied
olmstead
inscrutable
subtly
sneering
smile
and
knew
that
he
had
made
a
wise
decision
i
gather
that
i
am
going
to
be
one
of
the
main
links
in
the
primary
chain
of
deliveries
what
the
technique
and
how
do
i
cover
up
technique
first
you
go
fishing
you
are
an
expert
at
that
i
believe
you
might
say
so
i
wo
have
to
do
any
faking
there
some
soon
and
later
on
we
hope
you
will
indulge
in
your
favorite
sport
at
some
lake
or
other
you
will
take
the
customary
solid
and
liquid
refreshments
along
in
a
when
you
have
finished
eating
you
will
toss
the
overboard
that
all
that
all
the
then
will
be
slightly
special
more
or
less
although
it
will
look
ordinary
enough
now
as
to
the
how
would
of
research
sound
i
do
know
depends
on
what
the
researchers
are
doing
before
i
became
an
engineer
i
was
a
pure
scientist
of
sorts
but
that
was
quite
a
while
ago
and
i
was
never
a
specialist
that
is
one
reason
why
i
think
you
will
do
we
have
plenty
of
specialists
too
many
i
often
think
they
dash
off
in
all
directions
without
rhyme
or
reason
what
we
want
is
a
man
with
enough
scientific
training
to
know
in
general
what
is
going
on
but
what
he
will
need
mostly
is
hard
common
sense
and
enough
ability
mental
force
you
might
call
it
to
hold
the
specialists
down
to
earth
and
make
them
pull
together
if
you
can
do
it
and
if
i
did
think
you
could
i
be
talking
to
you
the
whole
force
will
know
that
you
are
earning
your
pay
just
as
we
could
not
hide
the
fact
that
your
two
predecessors
were
put
that
way
it
sounds
good
i
would
wonder
if
i
could
handle
it
the
conversation
went
on
but
the
rest
of
it
is
of
little
importance
here
the
plane
landed
isaacson
introduced
the
new
director
of
research
to
works
manager
rand
who
in
turn
introduced
him
to
a
few
of
his
scientists
and
to
the
svelte
and
spectacular
who
was
to
be
his
private
secretary
it
was
clear
from
the
first
that
the
research
department
was
not
going
to
be
an
easy
one
to
manage
the
top
men
were
defiant
the
middle
ranks
were
sullen
the
smaller
fry
were
apprehensive
as
well
as
sullen
the
secretary
flaunted
chips
on
both
shapely
shoulders
men
and
women
alike
expected
the
application
of
the
old
wheeze
a
new
broom
sweeps
clean
for
the
third
time
in
scarcely
twice
that
many
months
and
they
were
defying
him
to
do
his
worst
wherefore
they
were
very
much
surprised
when
the
new
boss
did
nothing
whatever
for
two
solid
weeks
except
read
reports
and
get
acquainted
with
his
department
how
like
your
new
boss
may
another
secretary
asked
during
a
break
oh
not
too
bad
i
guess
may
tone
was
full
of
reservations
he
quiet
sort
of
reserved
no
passes
or
anything
like
that
it
be
funny
if
i
finally
got
a
boss
that
had
something
on
the
ball
it
but
you
know
what
molly
the
giggled
suddenly
i
had
a
first
you
know
with
a
million
credits
worth
of
and
such
stuff
and
then
a
i
wonder
what
this
olmstead
does
with
his
spare
cash
you
find
out
dearie
no
doubt
molly
tone
gave
the
words
a
meaning
slightly
different
from
the
semantic
one
of
their
arrangement
i
intend
to
molly
i
intend
to
may
meaning
too
was
not
expressed
exactly
by
the
sequence
of
words
used
it
must
be
tough
a
boss
life
having
to
sit
at
a
desk
or
be
in
conference
six
or
seven
hours
a
day
when
he
is
playing
around
somewhere
for
a
measly
thousand
credits
or
so
a
month
how
do
they
get
that
way
you
said
it
may
you
said
it
but
we
get
ours
huh
time
went
on
george
olmstead
studied
reports
and
more
reports
he
read
one
and
it
frowning
he
compared
it
minutely
with
another
then
sent
may
to
hunt
up
one
which
had
been
turned
in
a
couple
of
weeks
before
he
took
them
home
that
evening
and
in
the
morning
he
punched
three
buttons
three
stiffly
polite
young
men
obeyed
his
summons
good
morning
doctor
olmstead
morning
boys
i
not
up
on
the
fundamental
theory
of
any
one
of
these
three
reports
but
if
you
combine
this
and
this
and
this
indicating
sections
of
the
three
documents
would
you
or
would
you
not
be
able
to
work
out
a
process
that
would
do
away
with
about
of
the
final
purification
and
separation
processes
they
did
not
know
it
had
not
been
the
business
of
any
one
of
them
or
of
all
them
collectively
to
find
out
i
making
it
your
business
as
of
now
drop
whatever
you
doing
put
your
heads
together
and
find
out
theory
first
then
a
laboratory
experiment
then
come
back
here
on
the
double
yes
sir
and
in
a
few
days
they
were
back
does
it
work
in
theory
it
should
sir
and
on
a
laboratory
scale
it
does
the
three
young
men
were
if
possible
even
stiffer
than
before
it
was
not
the
first
time
nor
would
it
be
the
last
that
a
director
of
research
would
seize
credit
for
work
which
he
was
not
capable
of
doing
good
miss
reed
get
me
rand
rand
olmstead
three
of
my
boys
have
just
hatched
out
something
that
may
be
worth
quite
a
few
million
credits
a
year
to
us
me
hell
no
talk
to
them
i
ca
understand
any
one
of
the
three
parts
of
it
to
say
nothing
of
inventing
it
i
want
you
to
give
a
class
aaa
priority
on
the
pilot
plant
as
of
right
now
if
they
can
develop
it
and
i
betting
they
can
i
going
to
put
their
pictures
in
the
northport
news
and
give
a
couple
of
thousand
credits
apiece
and
a
couple
of
weeks
vacation
to
spend
it
in
yeah
i
send
in
he
turned
to
the
flabbergasted
three
take
your
dope
in
to
rand
now
show
him
what
you
got
then
tear
into
that
pilot
plant
and
a
little
later
molly
and
may
again
met
in
the
powder
room
so
your
new
boss
is
a
molly
snickered
and
they
say
he
paid
over
hundred
for
a
you
were
right
may
a
boss
life
must
be
mighty
hard
to
take
and
he
sits
around
more
and
does
less
they
say
than
any
other
exec
in
the
plant
says
so
the
dirty
sneaking
liars
the
blazed
completely
unaware
that
she
had
reversed
her
former
position
and
even
if
it
so
which
it
is
he
can
do
more
work
sitting
perfectly
still
than
any
other
boss
in
the
whole
works
can
do
tearing
around
at
forty
parsecs
a
minute
so
there
george
olmstead
was
earning
his
salary
his
position
was
fully
consolidated
when
a
few
days
later
a
tremor
of
excitement
ran
through
the
research
department
heads
up
everybody
isaacson
himself
is
coming
what
for
i
wonder
he
going
to
take
the
old
man
away
from
us
already
do
you
he
came
he
went
through
for
the
first
time
the
entire
department
he
observed
minutely
and
he
understood
what
he
saw
olmstead
led
the
big
boss
into
his
private
office
and
flipped
the
switch
which
supposedly
rendered
that
sanctum
proof
against
any
and
all
forms
of
spying
eavesdropping
intrusion
and
communication
it
did
not
however
close
the
deeper
subtler
channels
which
the
lensmen
used
good
work
george
so
good
that
i
going
to
have
to
take
you
out
of
department
q
entirely
and
make
you
works
manager
of
our
new
plant
on
vegia
have
you
got
a
man
you
can
break
in
to
take
your
place
here
including
department
q
no
although
olmstead
did
not
show
it
he
was
disappointed
at
hearing
the
word
vegia
he
had
been
aiming
much
higher
than
that
at
the
secret
planet
of
the
boskonian
armed
forces
no
less
but
there
might
still
be
enough
time
to
win
a
transfer
there
excluding
i
got
another
good
man
here
now
for
that
jones
not
heavy
enough
though
for
vegia
in
that
case
yes
whitworth
one
of
the
boys
who
worked
out
the
new
process
it
take
a
little
time
though
three
weeks
minimum
three
weeks
it
is
today
friday
you
got
things
in
shape
you
so
that
you
can
take
the
off
i
was
figuring
on
it
i
not
going
where
i
thought
i
was
though
i
imagine
probably
not
lake
chesuncook
on
route
rough
country
and
the
hotel
is
something
less
than
fourth
rate
but
the
fishing
ca
be
beat
i
glad
of
that
when
i
fish
i
like
to
catch
something
it
would
smell
if
you
did
they
stock
in
the
cafeteria
you
know
have
your
girl
get
you
one
full
of
sandwiches
and
stuff

early
this
afternoon
as
soon
as
you
can
after
i
leave
be
sure
and
see
jones
with
your
before
you
leave
miss
reed
please
send
whitworth
in
then
skip
down
to
the
cafeteria
and
get
me
a
sandwiches
and
a
thermos
of
coffee
provender
suitable
for
a
wet
and
hungry
fisherman
yes
there
were
no
chips
now
the
boss
was
the
top
ace
of
the
whole
plant
hi
ned
take
the
throne
olmstead
waved
his
hand
at
the
now
vacant
chair
behind
the
big
desk
hold
it
down
i
get
back
monday
maybe
going
fishing
huh
gone
was
all
trace
of
stiffness
of
reserve
of
unfriendliness
you
big
lucky
stiff
well
my
brilliant
young
squirt
maybe
you
get
old
and
fat
enough
to
go
fishing
yourself
some
day
who
knows
in
hand
and
encumbered
with
tackle
olmstead
walked
blithely
along
the
corridor
to
the
office
of
assistant
works
manager
jones
while
he
had
not
known
just
what
to
expect
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
a
exactly
like
his
own
upon
the
he
placed
his
box
beside
it
hi
olmstead
by
no
slightest
flicker
of
expression
did
either
lensman
step
out
of
character
shoving
off
early
yeah
dropped
by
to
let
the
head
office
know
i
wo
be
in
monday
so
i
but
more
speed
for
me
chemquassabamticook
lake
do
you
pronounce
that
or
sneeze
it
but
have
fun
my
boy
combining
business
with
pleasure
though
breaking
in
whitworth
on
my
job
that
fairplay
thing
is
going
to
break
in
about
an
hour
and
scare
the
pants
off
of
him
but
it
keep
until
monday
anyway
and
if
he
handles
it
right
he
just
about
in
jones
grinned
a
bit
brutal
perhaps
but
a
sure
way
to
find
out
so
long
olmstead
strolled
out
nonchalantly
picking
up
the
wrong
lunch
box
on
the
way
and
left
the
building
he
ordered
his
dillingham
and
tossed
the
aboard
as
carelessly
as
though
it
did
not
contain
an
unknown
number
of
millions
of
credits
worth
of
uncut
thionite
i
hope
you
have
a
nice
sir
the
said
as
he
helped
stow
baggage
and
tackle
thanks
otto
i
bring
you
a
couple
of
fish
monday
if
i
catch
that
many
and
it
should
be
said
in
passing
that
he
brought
them
lensmen
keep
their
promises
under
whatever
circumstances
or
however
lightly
given
it
being
of
friday
the
traffic
was
already
heavy
northport
was
not
a
metropolis
of
course
but
on
the
other
hand
it
did
not
have
metropolitan
streets
but
olmstead
was
in
no
hurry
he
inched
his
spectacular
mount
it
was
a
violently
iridescent
chrome
green
in
color
with
highly
polished
chromium
gingerbread
wherever
there
was
any
excuse
for
gingerbread
to
be
across
the
city
and
into
the
side
of
the
superhighway
even
then
he
did
not
hurry
he
wanted
to
hit
the
inspection
station
at
the
edge
of
the
preserve
at
dusk
ninety
miles
an
hour
would
do
it
he
worked
his
way
into
the
lane
and
became
motionless
relative
to
the
other
vehicles
on
the
strip
it
was
a
peculiar
sensation
it
seemed
as
though
the
cars
themselves
were
stationary
with
the
pavement
flowing
backward
beneath
them
there
was
no
passing
no
weaving
no
cutting
in
and
out
only
occasionally
would
the
formation
be
broken
as
a
car
would
shift
almost
imperceptibly
to
one
side
or
the
other
speeding
up
or
slowing
down
to
match
the
assigned
speed
of
the
neighboring
way
the
afternoon
was
bright
and
clear
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
olmstead
enjoyed
his
drive
thoroughly
and
arrived
at
the
right
on
schedule
leaving
the
wide
smooth
way
he
slowed
down
abruptly
even
a
dillingham
could
not
make
speed
on
the
narrow
rough
and
hilly
road
to
chesuncook
lake
at
dusk
he
reached
the
post
instead
of
stopping
on
the
pavement
he
pulled
off
the
road
got
out
stretched
hugely
and
took
a
few
steps
to
take
the
kinks
out
of
his
legs
a
lot
of
road
eh
the
trooper
remarked
no
guns
no
guns
olmstead
opened
up
for
inspection
from
northport
funny
is
it
how
hard
it
is
to
stop
even
when
you
are
in
any
particular
hurry
guess
i
eat
now
join
me
in
a
sandwich
and
some
hot
coffee
or
a
cold
lemon
sour
or
cherry
soda
i
got
my
own
supper
thanks
i
was
just
going
to
eat
but
did
you
say
a
lemon
sour
zero
degrees
centigrade
i
join
you
in
that
case
thanks
olmstead
opened
a
compartment
took
out
two
bottles
placed
them
and
his
open
invitingly
on
the
low
stone
wall
hm
m
quite
a
zipper
you
got
there
mister
the
trooper
gazed
admiringly
at
the
luxurious
monster
listened
appreciatively
to
its
almost
inaudible
hum
i
heard
about
those
new
supers
but
that
is
the
first
one
i
ever
saw
nice
all
the
comforts
of
home
eh
just
about
sure
you
wo
help
me
clean
up
on
those
sandwiches
before
they
get
stale
seated
on
the
wall
the
two
men
ate
and
talked
if
that
trooper
had
known
what
was
in
the
box
beside
his
leg
he
probably
would
have
fallen
over
backward
but
how
was
he
even
to
suspect
there
was
nothing
crass
or
rough
or
coarse
about
any
of
the
work
of
any
of
boskone
operators
olmstead
drove
on
to
the
lake
and
took
up
his
reservation
at
the
ramshackle
hotel
he
slept
and
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
he
was
up
and
fishing
and
this
part
of
the
performance
he
really
enjoyed
he
knew
his
stuff
and
the
fish
were
there
big
wary
and
game
he
loved
it
at
noon
he
ate
and
quite
openly
and
brazenly
consigned
the
empty
box
to
the
watery
deep
even
if
he
had
not
had
so
many
fish
to
carry
he
was
not
the
type
to
lug
a
cheap
back
to
town
he
fished
joyously
all
afternoon
without
getting
quite
the
limit
and
as
the
sun
grazed
the
horizon
he
started
his
and
skimmed
back
to
the
dock
the
thing
had
sent
out
any
radiation
yet
northrop
informed
him
tensely
but
it
certainly
would
and
when
it
did
they
be
ready
there
were
lensmen
and
patrolmen
all
over
the
place
thicker
than
hair
on
a
dog
and
george
olmstead
sighing
wearily
and
yet
blissfully
anticipatory
of
one
more
day
of
enthralling
sport
gathered
up
his
equipment
and
his
fish
and
strolled
toward
the
hotel
chapter
forty
thousand
miles
from
earth
center
the
loafed
along
a
circular
arc
inert
at
a
mere
ten
thousand
miles
an
hour
a
speed
which
and
not
by
accident
kept
her
practically
stationary
above
a
certain
point
on
the
planet
surface
nor
was
it
by
chance
that
both
virgil
samms
and
roderick
kinnison
were
aboard
and
a
dozen
or
so
other
craft
cruisers
and
such
whose
officers
were
out
to
put
in
their
logs
were
flitting
aimlessly
about
but
never
very
far
away
from
the
flagship
and
farther
out
well
out
a
cordon
of
detector
ships
swept
space
to
the
full
limit
of
their
prodigious
reach
the
navigating
officers
of
those
vessels
knew
to
a
nicety
the
place
and
course
of
every
ship
lawfully
in
the
ether
and
the
appearance
of
even
one
unscheduled
trace
would
set
in
motion
a
long
succession
of
events
and
far
below
grazing
atmosphere
never
very
far
from
the
direct
line
between
the
and
earth
core
floated
a
palatial
pleasure
yacht
and
this
craft
carried
not
one
lensman
or
two
but
eight
two
of
whom
kept
their
eyes
fixed
upon
their
observation
plates
they
were
watching
a
resting
upon
the
bottom
of
a
lake
has
it
radiated
roderick
kinnison
demanded
or
been
approached
or
moved
not
yet
lyman
cleveland
replied
crisply
neither
northrop
rig
nor
mine
has
shown
any
sign
of
activity
he
did
not
amplify
the
statement
nor
was
there
need
mason
northrop
was
a
master
electronicist
cleveland
was
perhaps
the
world
greatest
living
expert
neither
of
them
had
detected
radiation
ergo
none
existed
equally
certainly
the
box
had
not
moved
or
been
moved
or
approached
no
change
rod
doctor
frederick
rodebush
lensed
the
assured
thought
six
of
us
have
been
watching
the
plates
in
shifts
a
few
minutes
later
however
here
is
a
thought
which
may
be
of
interest
dalnalten
the
venerian
announced
spraying
himself
with
a
couple
pints
of
water
it
is
natural
enough
of
course
for
any
venerian
to
be
in
or
on
any
water
he
can
reach
i
would
enjoy
very
much
being
on
or
in
that
lake
myself
but
it
may
not
be
entirely
by
coincidence
that
one
particular
venerian
ossmen
is
visiting
this
particular
lake
at
this
particular
time
what
nine
lensmen
yelled
the
thought
practically
as
one
precisely
ossmen
it
was
a
measure
of
the
venerian
lensman
concern
that
he
used
only
two
words
instead
of
twenty
or
thirty
in
the
red
boat
with
the
yellow
sail
do
you
see
any
detector
rigs
samms
asked
he
would
need
any
dalnalten
put
in
he
will
be
able
to
see
it
or
if
a
little
colane
had
been
rubbed
on
it
which
no
tellurian
could
have
noticed
any
venerian
could
smell
it
from
one
end
of
that
lake
to
the
other
true
i
did
think
of
that
it
may
not
have
a
transmitter
after
all
maybe
not
but
keep
on
listening
anyway
the
port
admiral
ordered
bend
a
plate
on
ossmen
and
a
couple
more
on
the
rest
of
the
boats
but
ossmen
is
clean
you
say
jack
not
even
a
block
he
could
have
a
block
dad
it
give
too
much
away
here
on
our
home
grounds
like
on
eridan
where
their
ops
could
wear
anything
they
could
lift
but
we
had
to
go
naked
he
flinched
mentally
as
he
recalled
his
encounter
with
hazel
the
and
northrop
flinched
with
him
that
right
rod
olmstead
in
his
boat
below
agreed
and
conway
costigan
in
his
room
in
northport
concurred
the
operatives
of
the
enemy
depended
for
safety
upon
perfection
of
technique
not
upon
crude
and
dangerous
mechanical
devices
well
since
you
all
so
sure
of
it
i
buy
it
and
the
waiting
went
on
under
the
slight
urge
of
the
light
and
vagrant
breeze
the
red
boat
moved
slowly
across
the
water
a
somnolent
lackadaisical
youth
who
very
evidently
cared
nothing
about
where
the
boat
went
sat
in
its
stern
with
his
left
arm
draped
loosely
across
the
tiller
nor
was
ossmen
any
more
concerned
his
only
care
apparently
was
to
avoid
interference
with
the
fishermen
his
jaunts
were
long
even
for
a
venerian
and
he
entered
and
left
the
water
as
smoothly
as
only
a
venerian
or
a
seal
could
however
he
could
have
and
probably
has
got
a
capsule
detector
jack
offered
presently
or
since
a
venerian
can
swallow
anything
one
inch
smaller
than
a
kitchen
stove
he
could
have
a
whole
analyzing
station
stashed
away
in
his
stomach
nobody
put
a
beam
on
him
yet
have
you
nobody
had
it
might
be
smart
not
to
watch
him
with
and
when
he
gets
up
close
to
the
box
better
pull
your
beams
off
of
it
dalnalten
i
do
suppose
it
would
be
quite
bright
for
you
to
go
swimming
down
there
too
would
it
very
definitely
not
which
is
why
i
am
up
here
and
dry
none
of
them
would
go
near
it
they
waited
and
finally
ossmen
purposeless
wanderings
brought
him
over
the
spot
on
the
lake
bottom
which
was
the
target
of
so
many
tellurian
eyes
he
gazed
at
the
discarded
as
incuriously
as
he
had
looked
at
so
many
other
sunken
objects
and
swam
over
it
as
casually
and
only
the
caught
what
he
actually
did
he
swam
serenely
on
the
box
is
still
there
the
men
reported
but
the
package
is
gone
good
kinnison
exclaimed
can
you
see
it
on
him
ten
to
one
they
ca
jack
said
he
swallowed
it
i
expected
him
to
swallow
it
box
and
all
we
ca
see
it
sir
he
must
have
swallowed
it
make
sure
yes
sir
he
back
on
the
boat
now
and
we
shot
him
from
all
angles
he
clean
nothing
outside
perfect
that
means
he
is
figuring
on
slipping
it
to
somebody
else
in
a
crowd
this
will
be
an
ordinary
job
of
shadowing
from
here
on
in
so
i
put
in
the
umbrella
the
detector
ships
were
recalled
the
and
the
various
other
ships
of
war
returned
to
their
various
bases
the
pleasure
craft
floated
away
but
on
the
other
hand
there
were
bursts
of
activity
throughout
the
forest
for
a
mile
or
so
back
from
the
shores
of
the
lake
camps
were
struck
hiking
parties
decided
that
they
had
hiked
enough
and
began
to
retrace
their
steps
lithe
young
men
who
had
been
doing
this
and
that
stopped
doing
it
and
headed
for
the
nearest
trails
for
kinnison
had
erred
slightly
in
saying
that
the
rest
of
the
enterprise
was
to
be
an
ordinary
job
of
shadowing
no
ordinary
job
would
do
with
the
game
this
nearly
in
the
bag
it
must
be
made
absolutely
certain
that
no
suspicion
was
aroused
and
yet
samms
had
to
have
sharp
hard
clear
facts
facts
so
facts
that
no
intelligence
above
idiot
grade
could
possibly
mistake
them
for
anything
but
facts
wherefore
ossmen
the
venerian
was
not
alone
thenceforth
from
lake
to
hotel
from
hotel
to
car
along
the
road
into
and
in
and
out
of
train
and
plane
clear
to
an
building
in
an
ordinary
business
section
of
new
york
he
was
alone
where
the
traveling
population
was
light
the
patrol
operatives
were
few
and
did
not
crowd
the
venerian
too
nearly
where
dense
as
in
a
metropolitan
station
they
ringed
him
three
deep
he
reached
his
destination
which
was
of
course
proofed
late
sunday
night
he
went
in
remained
briefly
came
out
shall
we
him
virge
follow
him
or
what
no
follow
him
cover
him
like
a
blanket
at
the
usual
time
give
him
the
usual
but
not
until
then
this
time
make
it
make
certain
that
he
has
got
it
on
him
in
him
or
in
or
around
his
house
there
be
nothing
doing
here
tonight
will
there
no
it
would
be
too
noticeable
so
you
fred
and
lyman
take
the
first
trick
the
rest
of
us
will
get
some
sleep
when
the
building
opened
monday
morning
the
lensmen
were
back
with
dozens
of
others
including
knobos
of
mars
there
were
also
present
or
nearby
literally
hundreds
of
the
shrewdest
most
capable
detectives
of
earth
so
is
their
headquarters
one
of
them
at
least
the
martian
thought
studying
the
trickle
of
people
entering
and
leaving
the
building
it
is
as
we
thought
dal
why
we
could
never
find
it
why
we
could
never
trace
any
wholesaler
backward
none
of
us
has
ever
seen
any
of
these
persons
before
complete
change
of
personnel
per
operation
probably
long
periods
of
quiescence
check
check
but
we
have
them
now
just
like
that
huh
jack
kinnison
jibed
and
from
his
viewpoint
his
idea
was
the
more
valid
for
the
wholesalers
were
very
clever
operators
indeed
from
the
more
professional
viewpoint
of
knobos
and
dalnalten
however
who
had
fought
a
steadily
losing
battle
so
long
the
task
was
not
too
difficult
their
forces
were
beautifully
organized
and
synchronized
they
were
present
in
such
overwhelming
numbers
that
tails
could
be
changed
every
fifteen
seconds
long
before
anybody
however
suspicious
could
begin
to
suspect
any
one
shadow
nor
was
it
necessary
for
the
tails
to
signal
each
other
however
inconspicuously
or
to
indicate
any
suspect
at
time
lensed
thoughts
directed
every
move
without
confusion
or
error
and
there
were
tiny
cameras
with
tremendous
protuberant
lenses
the
long
eyes
capable
of
taking
close
ups
from
five
hundred
feet
and
other
devices
and
apparatus
and
equipment
too
numerous
to
mention
here
thus
the
wholesalers
were
traced
and
their
transactions
with
the
retail
peddlers
were
recorded
and
from
that
point
on
even
jack
kinnison
had
to
admit
that
the
sailing
was
clear
these
small
fry
were
not
smart
and
their
customers
were
even
less
so
none
had
screens
or
detectors
or
other
apparatus
their
every
transaction
could
be
and
was
recorded
from
a
distance
of
many
miles
by
the
of
the
patrol
and
not
only
the
transactions
clearly
unmistakeably
the
purchaser
was
followed
from
buying
to
sniffing
nor
was
the
time
intervening
ever
long
thionite
then
as
now
was
bought
at
retail
only
to
use
and
the
whole
ghastly
thing
went
down
on
tape
and
film
the
gasping
hysterical
appeal
the
exchange
of
currency
for
drug
the
headlong
rush
to
a
place
of
solitude
the
rigid
and
the
horribly
ecstatic
transports
the
shaken
recovery
or
the
entranced
death
it
all
went
on
record
it
was
sickening
to
have
to
record
such
things
more
than
one
observer
did
sicken
in
fact
and
had
to
be
relieved
but
virgil
samms
had
to
have
concrete
positive
irrefutable
evidence
he
got
it
any
possible
jury
upon
seeing
that
evidence
would
know
it
to
be
the
truth
no
possible
jury
after
seeing
that
evidence
could
bring
in
any
verdict
other
than
guilty
oddly
enough
jack
kinnison
was
the
only
casualty
of
that
long
and
hectic
day
a
man
later
proved
to
be
a
potentate
of
the
underworld
who
was
not
even
under
suspicion
at
the
time
for
some
reason
or
other
got
the
idea
that
jack
was
after
him
the
lensman
had
perhaps
allowed
some
part
of
his
long
eye
to
show
a
fast
and
efficient
telephoto
lens
is
a
devilishly
awkward
thing
to
conceal
at
any
rate
the
racketeer
sent
out
a
call
for
help
just
in
case
his
bodyguards
would
not
be
enough
and
in
the
meantime
his
personal
attendants
rallied
enthusiastically
around
they
had
two
objects
in
view
one
to
pass
a
knife
expeditiously
and
quietly
through
young
kinnison
throat
from
ear
to
ear
and
two
to
tear
the
long
eye
apart
and
subject
a
few
square
inches
of
emulsion
to
the
bright
light
of
day
and
if
the
big
shot
had
known
that
the
photographer
was
not
alone
that
the
big
hulking
bruiser
a
few
feet
away
was
also
a
bull
they
might
have
succeeded
two
of
the
four
hoods
reached
jack
just
fractionally
ahead
of
the
other
two
one
to
seize
the
camera
the
other
to
swing
the
knife
but
jack
kinnison
was
fast
fast
of
brain
and
nerve
and
muscle
he
saw
them
coming
in
three
flashing
motions
he
bent
the
barrel
of
the
telephoto
into
a
neat
arc
around
the
side
of
the
first
man
head
ducked
frantically
under
the
knife
and
drove
the
toe
of
his
boot
into
the
spot
upon
which
like
to
have
their
land
both
of
those
attackers
lost
interest
promptly
one
of
them
lost
interest
permanently
for
a
telephoto
lens
in
barrel
is
heavy
very
rigid
and
very
hard
while
battling
jack
was
still
off
balance
the
other
two
guards
arrived
but
so
did
mason
northrop
mase
was
not
quite
as
fast
as
jack
was
but
as
has
been
pointed
out
he
was
bigger
and
much
stronger
when
he
hit
a
man
with
either
hand
that
man
dropped
it
was
the
same
as
being
on
the
receiving
end
of
the
blow
of
a
hammer
falling
through
a
distance
of
ninety
seven
and
feet
the
lensmen
had
of
course
also
yelled
for
help
and
it
took
only
a
split
second
for
a
patrol
speedster
to
travel
from
any
given
point
to
any
other
in
the
same
county
it
took
no
time
at
all
for
that
speedster
to
fill
a
couple
of
square
blocks
with
patterns
of
force
through
which
neither
bullets
nor
beams
could
be
driven
therefore
the
battle
ended
as
suddenly
as
it
began
before
more
thugs
with
their
automatics
and
portables
could
reach
the
scene
kinnison
cursed
and
damned
fulminantly
the
edict
which
had
forbidden
arms
that
day
and
swore
that
he
would
never
get
out
of
bed
again
without
strapping
on
at
least
two
blasters
but
he
had
to
admit
finally
that
he
had
nothing
to
squawk
about
kinnison
explained
quite
patiently
for
him
that
all
he
had
got
out
of
the
little
fracas
was
a
split
lip
that
young
northrop
hair
was
even
mussed
and
that
if
everybody
had
been
packing
guns
some
young
damn
fool
like
him
would
have
started
blasting
and
blown
everything
higher
than
up
would
have
spoiled
samms
whole
operation
maybe
beyond
repair
now
would
he
please
quit
bellyaching
and
get
to
hell
out
he
got
that
buttons
thionite
up
do
you
think
rod
kinnison
asked
and
the
lawyers
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
the
case
licked
into
shape
and
lined
up
for
trial
yes
and
no
samms
frowned
in
thought
the
is
complete
from
original
producer
to
ultimate
consumer
but
our
best
guess
is
that
it
will
take
years
to
get
the
really
important
offenders
behind
bars
why
i
thought
you
were
giving
them
altogether
too
much
time
when
you
scheduled
the
for
three
weeks
ahead
of
election
because
the
drug
racket
is
only
a
small
part
of
it
we
going
to
break
the
whole
thing
at
once
you
know
and
mateese
covers
a
lot
more
ground
murder
kidnapping
bribery
corruption
misfeasance
practically
everything
you
can
think
of
i
know
what
of
it
jurisdiction
among
other
things
with
the
president
over
half
of
the
congress
much
of
the
judiciary
and
practically
all
of
the
political
bosses
and
police
chiefs
of
the
continent
under
indictment
at
once
the
legal
problem
becomes
incredibly
difficult
the
patrol
department
of
law
has
been
working
on
it
twenty
four
hours
a
day
and
the
only
thing
they
seem
sure
of
is
a
long
succession
of
points
of
law
there
are
no
precedents
whatever
precedents
be
damned
they
guilty
and
everybody
knows
it
change
the
laws
so
that
we
will
samms
interrupted
sharply
we
want
and
we
will
have
government
by
law
not
by
men
we
have
had
too
much
of
that
already
speed
is
not
of
the
essence
justice
very
definitely
is
samms
now
and
forever
but
i
buy
it
virge
now
get
back
down
to
earth
operation
zwilnik
is
all
set
mateese
is
going
good
zabriska
tied
into
zwilnik
that
leaves
operation
boskone
which
is
i
suppose
still
getting
nowhere
fast
the
first
lensman
did
not
reply
it
was
and
both
men
knew
it
the
shrewdest
most
capable
and
experienced
operatives
of
the
patrol
had
hit
that
wall
with
everything
they
had
and
had
simply
bounced
trials
had
found
no
point
of
contact
no
angle
of
approach
middle
level
ditto
george
olmstead
working
at
the
highest
possible
level
was
morally
certain
that
he
had
found
a
point
of
contact
but
had
not
been
able
to
do
anything
with
it
how
about
calling
a
council
conference
on
it
kinnison
asked
finally
or
bergenholm
at
least
maybe
he
can
get
one
of
his
hunches
on
it
i
have
discussed
it
with
them
all
just
as
i
have
with
you
no
one
had
anything
constructive
to
offer
except
to
go
ahead
with
bennett
as
you
are
doing
the
concensus
is
that
the
boskonians
know
just
as
much
about
our
military
affairs
as
we
know
about
theirs
no
more
it
be
too
much
to
expect
them
to
be
dumb
enough
to
figure
us
as
dumb
enough
to
depend
only
on
our
visible
grand
fleet
after
the
warning
they
gave
us
at
the
hill
kinnison
admitted
yes
what
worries
me
most
is
that
they
had
a
running
start
not
enough
to
count
the
port
admiral
declared
we
can
and
do
be
you
ca
deny
them
the
possession
of
brains
ability
and
resources
at
least
equal
to
ours
i
do
have
to
kinnison
remained
obstinately
cheerful
morale
my
boy
is
what
counts
and
tonnage
and
are
important
of
course
but
morale
has
won
every
war
in
history
and
our
morale
right
now
is
higher
than
a
cat
back
higher
than
any
time
since
john
paul
jones
and
getting
higher
by
the
day
yes
the
question
was
monosyllabic
but
potent
yes
i
mean
just
that
from
what
we
know
of
their
system
they
have
the
morale
we
got
anything
they
can
do
we
can
do
more
of
and
better
what
you
got
virge
is
a
bad
case
of
ingrowing
nerves
you
never
been
to
bennett
in
spite
of
the
number
of
times
i
asked
you
to
i
say
take
time
right
now
and
come
along
it
be
good
for
what
ails
you
it
will
also
be
a
very
fine
thing
for
bennett
and
for
the
patrol
you
find
yourself
no
stranger
there
you
may
have
something
there
i
do
it
port
admiral
and
first
lensman
went
to
bennett
not
in
the
or
other
superdreadnaught
but
in
a
speedster
this
was
necessary
because
as
far
as
that
planet
was
concerned
was
a
strictly
affair
except
for
lensmen
only
lensmen
could
leave
bennett
under
any
circumstances
or
for
any
reason
whatever
there
was
no
mail
express
or
freight
even
the
of
the
fleet
while
on
practice
maneuvers
outside
the
envelopes
surrounding
the
system
were
so
screened
that
no
unauthorized
communication
could
possibly
be
made
in
other
words
kinnison
finished
explaining
we
slapped
on
everything
anybody
could
think
of
including
bergenholm
and
rularion
and
believe
me
brother
that
was
a
lot
of
stuff
but
would
the
very
fact
of
such
rigid
restrictions
operate
against
morale
it
is
a
truism
of
psychology
that
imprisonment
like
everything
else
is
purely
relative
yeah
that
what
i
told
rularion
except
i
used
simpler
and
rougher
language
you
know
how
sarcastic
and
superior
he
is
even
when
wrong
i
know
well
when
he
right
he
too
damned
insufferable
for
words
thought
he
was
talking
to
the
prize
boob
of
a
class
of
as
long
as
nobody
on
the
planet
knew
that
there
was
any
such
thing
as
or
suspected
that
they
were
not
the
only
form
of
intelligent
life
in
the
universe
it
was
all
right
no
such
concept
as
being
could
exist
they
had
all
the
room
there
was
but
after
they
met
us
and
digested
all
the
implications
they
would
develop
the
no
end
this
of
course
is
an
extreme
simplification
of
the
way
the
old
coot
poured
it
into
me
but
he
came
through
with
the
solution
so
i
took
it
like
a
little
man
what
was
the
solution
it
a
shame
you
were
too
busy
to
come
in
on
it
you
see
when
we
land
but
virgil
samms
was
quick
on
the
uptake
even
before
they
landed
he
understood
when
the
speedster
slowed
down
for
atmosphere
he
saw
blazoned
upon
the
clouds
a
welter
of
one
repeated
signal
as
they
came
to
ground
he
saw
that
the
same
set
of
symbols
was
repeated
not
only
upon
every
available
cloud
but
also
upon
airships
captive
balloons
streamers
roofs
and
sides
of
buildings
even
in
rocks
and
upon
the
ground
itself
twenty
haress
samms
translated
and
frowned
in
thought
a
date
of
the
bennettan
year
would
it
by
any
chance
happen
to
coincide
with
our
tellurian
november
fourteenth
of
this
present
year
bright
boy
kinnison
applauded
i
thought
you
get
it
but
not
so
fast
yes
election
day
i
see
they
know
what
is
going
on
then
everything
that
counts
they
know
what
we
stand
to
win
and
lose
they
named
it
liberation
day
and
everything
on
the
planet
is
building
up
to
it
in
a
grand
crescendo
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
it
at
first
but
if
the
screens
are
really
tight
it
wo
make
any
difference
how
many
people
know
it
and
if
they
are
the
beans
would
all
be
spilled
anyway
and
it
really
works
i
get
a
bigger
thrill
every
time
i
come
here
i
can
see
where
it
might
work
bennett
was
a
fully
tellurian
world
in
mass
in
atmosphere
and
in
climate
her
native
peoples
were
human
to
the
limit
of
classification
both
physically
and
mentally
and
first
lensman
samms
as
he
toured
it
with
his
friend
found
a
world
aflame
with
a
zeal
and
an
ardor
unknown
to
blase
earth
since
the
days
of
the
crusades
the
patrol
cleverest
and
shrewdest
psychologists
by
merely
sticking
to
the
truth
had
done
a
marvelous
job
bennett
knew
that
it
was
the
arsenal
and
the
navy
yard
of
civilization
and
it
was
proud
of
it
its
factories
were
humming
as
they
had
never
hummed
before
every
industry
every
business
every
farm
was
operating
at
one
hundred
percent
of
capacity
bennett
was
dotted
and
spattered
with
spaceports
already
built
and
hundreds
more
were
being
rushed
to
completion
the
already
staggering
number
of
ships
of
war
operating
out
of
those
ports
was
being
augmented
every
hour
by
more
and
ever
more
shapes
it
was
an
honor
to
help
build
those
ships
it
was
a
still
greater
one
to
help
man
them
competitive
examinations
were
being
held
constantly
nor
were
all
or
even
most
of
the
applicants
native
bennettans
samms
did
not
have
to
ask
where
these
young
people
were
coming
from
he
knew
from
all
the
planets
of
civilization
attracted
by
advertisements
of
good
jobs
at
high
pay
on
new
and
highly
secret
projects
on
newly
discovered
planets
there
were
hundreds
of
such
ads
most
were
probably
the
patrol
and
led
here
many
were
of
spaceways
uranium
incorporated
and
other
mercantile
firms
the
possibility
that
some
of
them
might
lead
to
what
was
now
being
called
boskonia
had
been
tested
thoroughly
but
with
uniformly
negative
results
lensmen
had
applied
by
scores
for
those
jobs
and
had
found
them
the
conclusion
was
unavoidable
boskone
was
doing
its
recruiting
on
planets
unknown
to
any
wearer
of
arisia
lens
on
the
other
hand
more
than
a
trickle
of
boskonians
were
applying
for
patrol
jobs
but
samms
was
almost
certain
that
none
had
been
accepted
the
final
screening
was
done
by
lensmen
and
in
such
matters
lensmen
did
not
make
many
or
serious
mistakes
bennett
had
been
informed
of
the
first
lensman
arrival
and
kinnison
had
been
guilty
of
a
gross
understatement
indeed
in
telling
samms
that
he
would
not
be
regarded
as
a
stranger
wherever
samms
went
he
was
met
by
wildly
enthusiastic
crowds
he
had
to
make
speeches
each
of
which
was
climaxed
by
a
tremendous
roar
of
to
liberation
day
no
lensman
material
here
you
say
rod
samms
asked
after
the
first
demonstration
was
over
one
of
his
prime
concerns
throughout
his
life
was
this
with
all
this
enthusiasm
sure
we
have
found
any
good
enough
to
refer
to
you
yet
however
in
a
few
years
when
the
younger
generation
gets
a
little
older
there
certainly
will
be
check
the
tour
of
inspection
and
acquaintance
was
finished
the
two
lensmen
started
back
to
earth
well
my
skeptical
and
pessimistic
friend
was
i
lying
or
not
kinnison
asked
as
soon
as
the
speedster
ports
were
sealed
can
they
match
that
or
not
you
were
and
i
do
believe
they
can
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
autocracies
have
parades
and
cheers
and
demonstrations
of
course
but
they
have
always
been
forced
artificial
those
were
spontaneous
not
only
that
but
the
enthusiasm
will
carry
through
we
be
piping
hot
and
ready
to
go
but
about
this
stumping
you
said
i
better
start
as
soon
as
we
get
back
within
a
few
days
i
say
i
would
wonder
so
let
use
this
time
in
working
out
a
plan
of
campaign
my
idea
is
to
start
out
like
this
chapter
conway
costigan
leaving
behind
him
scores
of
clues
all
highly
misleading
severed
his
connection
with
uranium
as
soon
as
he
dared
after
operation
zwilnik
had
been
brought
to
a
successful
close
the
technical
operation
that
is
the
legal
battles
in
which
it
figured
so
largely
were
to
run
on
for
enough
years
to
make
the
word
zwilnik
a
common
noun
and
adjective
in
the
language
he
came
to
tellus
as
unobtrusively
as
was
his
wont
and
took
an
inconspicuous
but
very
active
part
in
operation
mateese
now
in
full
swing
now
is
the
time
for
all
good
men
and
true
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
party
eh
clio
costigan
giggled
you
can
play
that
straight
across
the
keyboard
of
your
electric
pet
and
not
with
just
two
fingers
either
did
you
hear
what
the
boss
told
today
yes
the
girl
levity
disappeared
they
so
spud
really
afraid
so
am
i
but
we
not
too
ourselves
if
we
have
to
be
and
we
covering
like
a
blanket
kinnison
and
samms
both
good
and
in
that
connection
i
have
to
be
out
half
the
night
again
tonight
all
right
of
course
it
so
nice
having
you
home
at
all
darling
instead
of
a
million
away
that
i
practically
delirious
with
delight
it
was
sometimes
hard
to
tell
what
impish
costigan
meant
by
what
she
said
costigan
looked
at
her
decided
she
was
taking
him
for
a
ride
and
smacked
her
a
couple
of
times
where
it
would
do
the
most
good
he
then
kissed
her
thoroughly
and
left
he
had
very
little
time
these
days
either
to
himself
or
for
his
lovely
and
adored
wife
for
roderick
kinnison
campaign
which
had
started
out
rough
and
not
too
clean
became
rougher
and
rougher
and
no
cleaner
as
it
went
along
morgan
and
his
crew
were
swinging
from
the
heels
with
everything
and
anything
they
could
dig
up
or
invent
however
little
of
truth
or
even
of
plausibility
it
might
contain
and
rod
the
rock
had
never
held
even
in
principle
with
the
gentle
precept
of
turning
the
other
cheek
he
was
rather
an
old
testamentarian
and
he
was
no
neophyte
at
dirty
fighting
as
a
young
operative
skilled
in
the
punishing
maiming
techniques
of
combat
he
had
brawled
successfully
in
most
of
the
dives
of
most
of
the
solarian
planets
and
of
most
of
their
moons
with
this
background
and
being
a
quick
study
and
under
the
masterly
coaching
of
virgil
samms
nels
bergenholm
and
rularion
of
north
polar
jupiter
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
learn
the
various
gambits
and
ripostes
of
this
but
nevertheless
political
mayhem
and
the
boys
and
girls
of
the
patrol
worked
like
badgers
digging
up
an
item
here
and
a
fact
there
and
a
bit
of
information
somewhere
else
all
for
the
day
of
reckoning
which
was
to
come
they
used
scanners
long
eyes
everything
they
could
think
of
to
use
and
they
could
not
be
blocked
out
or
evaded
we
it
boss
now
let
it
no
save
it
nail
it
down
solid
get
the
facts
names
dates
places
and
amounts
prove
it
first
then
save
it
it
save
it
the
joint
injunction
was
used
so
often
that
it
came
to
be
a
slogan
and
was
accepted
as
such
unlike
most
slogans
however
it
was
carefully
and
diligently
put
to
use
the
operatives
proved
it
and
saved
it
over
and
over
over
and
over
again
by
dint
of
what
unsparing
effort
and
selfless
devotion
only
they
themselves
ever
fully
knew
kinnison
stumped
the
continent
he
visited
every
state
all
of
the
big
cities
most
of
the
towns
and
many
villages
and
hamlets
and
always
wherever
he
went
a
part
of
the
show
was
to
demonstrate
to
his
audiences
how
the
lens
worked
look
at
me
you
know
that
no
two
individuals
are
or
ever
can
be
alike
robert
johnson
is
not
like
fred
smith
joe
jones
is
entirely
different
from
john
brown
look
at
me
again
concentrate
upon
whatever
it
is
in
your
mind
that
makes
me
roderick
kinnison
the
individual
that
will
enable
each
of
you
to
get
into
as
close
touch
with
me
as
though
our
two
minds
were
one
i
am
not
talking
now
you
are
reading
my
mind
since
you
are
reading
my
very
mind
you
know
exactly
what
i
am
thinking
for
better
or
for
worse
it
is
impossible
for
my
mind
to
lie
to
yours
since
i
can
change
neither
the
basic
pattern
of
my
personality
nor
my
basic
way
of
thought
nor
would
i
if
i
could
being
in
my
mind
you
know
that
already
you
know
what
my
basic
quality
is
my
friends
call
it
strength
and
courage
pirate
chief
morgan
and
his
crew
call
it
many
other
things
be
that
as
it
may
you
now
know
whether
or
not
you
want
me
for
your
president
i
can
do
nothing
whatever
to
sway
your
opinion
for
what
your
minds
have
perceived
you
know
to
be
the
truth
that
is
the
way
the
lens
works
it
bares
the
depths
of
my
mind
to
yours
and
in
return
enables
me
to
understand
your
thoughts
but
it
is
in
no
sense
hypnotism
as
morgan
is
so
foolishly
trying
to
make
you
believe
morgan
knows
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
do
that
even
the
most
accomplished
hypnotist
with
all
his
apparatus
can
not
affect
a
strong
and
definitely
opposed
will
he
is
therefore
saying
that
each
and
every
one
of
you
now
receiving
this
thought
is
such
a
spineless
weakling
that
but
you
may
draw
your
own
conclusions
in
closing
remember
nail
this
fact
down
so
solidly
that
you
will
never
forget
it
a
sound
and
healthy
mind
can
not
lie
the
mouth
can
and
does
so
does
the
typewriter
but
the
mind
never
i
can
hide
my
thoughts
from
you
even
while
we
are
en
rapport
like
this
but
i
can
not
lie
to
you
that
is
why
some
day
all
of
your
highest
executives
will
have
to
be
lensmen
and
not
politicians
diplomats
crooks
and
boodlers
i
thank
you
as
that
long
bitter
incredibly
vicious
campaign
neared
its
vitriolic
end
tension
mounted
higher
and
ever
higher
and
in
a
room
in
the
samms
home
three
young
lensmen
and
a
girl
were
not
at
ease
all
four
were
lean
and
drawn
jack
kinnison
was
talking
not
the
party
so
much
but
dad
he
started
out
with
bare
fists
and
now
he
wading
into
with
spiked
brass
knuckles
you
can
play
across
the
board
costigan
agreed
he
really
giving
hell
northrop
said
admiringly
did
you
boys
listen
in
on
his
casper
speech
last
night
they
had
they
had
been
too
busy
i
could
give
it
to
you
on
your
lenses
but
i
could
reproduce
the
tone
the
exquisite
way
he
lifted
large
pieces
of
hide
and
rubbed
salt
into
the
raw
places
when
he
gets
excited
you
know
he
ca
help
but
use
voice
too
so
i
got
some
of
it
on
a
record
he
starts
out
on
voice
nice
and
easy
as
usual
then
goes
onto
his
lens
without
talking
then
starts
yelling
as
well
as
thinking
listen
you
ought
to
have
a
lensman
president
you
may
not
believe
that
any
lensman
is
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
be
incorruptible
that
is
my
belief
as
you
can
feel
for
yourselves
but
i
can
not
it
to
you
only
time
can
do
that
it
is
a
fact
however
which
you
can
feel
for
yourselves
that
a
lensman
president
could
not
lie
to
you
except
by
word
of
mouth
or
in
writing
you
could
demand
from
him
at
any
time
a
lensed
statement
upon
any
subject
upon
some
matters
of
state
he
could
and
should
refuse
to
answer
but
not
upon
any
question
involving
moral
turpitude
if
he
answered
you
would
know
the
truth
if
he
refused
to
answer
you
would
know
why
and
could
initiate
impeachment
proceedings
then
and
there
in
the
past
there
have
been
presidents
who
used
that
high
office
for
low
purposes
whose
very
memory
reeks
of
malfeasance
and
corruption
one
was
impeached
others
should
have
been
witherspoon
never
should
have
been
elected
witherspoon
should
have
been
impeached
the
day
after
he
was
inaugurated
witherspoon
should
be
impeached
now
we
know
and
at
the
grand
rally
at
new
york
spaceport
three
weeks
from
tonight
we
are
going
to
prove
that
witherspoon
is
simply
a
minor
in
the
machine
footsie
at
command
with
whatever
group
happens
to
be
the
highest
bidder
at
the
moment
irrespective
of
north
america
or
the
system
good
witherspoon
is
a
gangster
a
cheat
and
a
god
damn
liar
but
he
is
of
very
little
actual
importance
merely
a
boodling
nincompoop
morgan
is
the
real
boss
and
the
real
menace
the
operating
engineer
of
the
lousiest
filthiest
rottenest
most
corrupt
machine
of
murderers
extortionists
panderers
perjurers
and
other
pimples
on
the
body
politic
that
has
ever
disgraced
any
civilized
government
good
night
wow
jack
kinnison
yelped
that
high
even
for
him
just
a
minute
jack
jill
cautioned
the
other
side
too
listen
to
this
choice
bit
from
senator
morgan
it
is
not
exactly
hypnotism
but
something
infinitely
worse
something
that
steals
away
your
very
minds
that
makes
anyone
listening
believe
that
white
is
yellow
red
purple
or
until
our
scientists
have
checked
this
menace
until
we
have
every
wearer
of
that
cursed
lens
behind
steel
bars
i
advise
you
in
all
earnestness
not
to
listen
to
them
at
all
if
you
do
listen
your
minds
will
surely
be
insidiously
decomposed
and
broken
you
will
surely
end
your
days
gibbering
in
a
padded
cell
and
murders
the
feeble
remnants
of
the
gangs
which
our
government
has
all
but
wiped
out
may
perhaps
commit
a
murder
or
so
per
year
the
perpetrators
of
which
are
caught
tried
and
punished
but
how
many
of
your
sons
and
daughters
has
roderick
kinnison
murdered
either
personally
or
through
his
uniformed
slaves
think
read
the
record
then
make
him
explain
if
he
can
but
do
not
listen
to
his
lying
lens
democracy
bah
what
does
the
rock
kinnison
the
hardest
most
vicious
tyrant
the
most
relentless
and
pitiless
martinet
ever
known
to
any
armed
force
in
the
long
history
of
our
world
know
of
democracy
nothing
he
understands
only
force
all
who
oppose
him
in
anything
however
small
or
who
seek
to
reason
with
him
die
without
record
or
trace
and
if
he
is
not
arrested
tried
and
executed
all
such
will
continue
tracelessly
and
without
any
pretense
of
trial
to
die
but
at
bottom
even
though
he
is
not
intelligent
enough
to
realize
it
he
is
merely
one
more
in
the
long
parade
of
tools
of
ruthless
and
predatory
wealth
the
monied
powers
my
friends
never
sleep
they
have
only
one
god
one
tenet
one
creed
the
almighty
credit
is
what
they
are
after
and
note
how
craftily
how
stealthily
they
have
done
and
are
doing
their
grabbing
where
is
your
representation
upon
that
galactic
council
how
did
this
criminal
this
vicious
this
outrageously
unconstitutional
this
irresponsible
uncontrollable
and
dictatorial
monstrosity
come
into
being
how
and
when
did
you
give
this
bloated
colossus
the
right
to
establish
its
own
currency
to
have
the
immeasurable
effrontery
to
debar
the
solidest
currency
in
the
universe
the
credit
of
north
america
from
and
commerce
their
aim
is
clear
they
intend
to
tax
you
into
slavery
and
death
do
not
forget
for
one
instant
my
friends
that
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy
our
forefathers
fought
and
bled
and
died
to
establish
the
principle
that
taxation
without
rep
and
so
on
for
one
solid
hour
jill
snarled
as
she
snapped
the
switch
viciously
how
do
you
like
potatoes
hell
blazing
pinnacles
this
from
jack
silent
for
seconds
and
rugged
stuff
very
rugged
from
northrop
no
wonder
you
look
sort
of
pooped
spud
being
chief
bodyguard
must
have
developed
recently
into
quite
a
chore
you
ai
just
snapping
your
choppers
bub
was
costigan
grimly
flippant
reply
i
yelled
for
help
in
force
so
have
i
and
i
going
to
yell
again
right
now
jack
declared
i
do
know
whether
dad
is
going
to
kill
morgan
or
not
and
do
give
a
damn
but
if
morgan
is
going
all
out
to
kill
dad
it
because
they
forgotten
how
to
make
bombs
he
lensed
a
call
to
bergenholm
yes
jack
i
will
refer
you
to
rularion
who
has
had
this
matter
under
consideration
yes
john
kinnison
i
have
considered
the
matter
and
have
taken
action
the
jovian
calmly
assured
thought
rolled
into
the
minds
of
all
even
lensless
jill
the
point
youth
was
well
taken
it
was
your
thought
that
some
thousands
perhaps
five
of
operators
and
other
operatives
will
be
required
to
insure
that
the
grand
rally
will
not
be
marred
by
episodes
of
violence
it
was
jack
said
flatly
it
still
is
not
having
considered
all
possible
contingencies
nor
the
extent
of
the
field
of
necessary
action
you
err
the
number
will
approach
nineteen
thousand
very
nearly
admiral
clayton
has
been
so
advised
and
his
staff
is
now
at
work
upon
a
plan
of
action
in
accordance
with
my
recommendation
your
suggestions
conway
costigan
in
the
matter
of
immediate
protection
of
roderick
kinnison
person
are
now
in
effect
and
you
are
hereby
relieved
of
that
responsibility
i
assume
that
you
four
wish
to
continue
at
work
the
jovian
assumption
was
sound
i
suggest
then
that
you
confer
with
admiral
clayton
and
fit
yourselves
into
his
program
of
security
i
intend
to
make
the
same
suggestion
to
all
lensmen
and
other
qualified
persons
not
engaged
in
work
of
more
pressing
importance
rularion
cut
off
and
jack
scowled
blackly
the
grand
rally
is
going
to
be
held
three
weeks
before
election
day
i
do
like
it
save
it
until
the
night
before
election
knock
their
teeth
out
with
it
at
the
last
possible
minute
you
wrong
jack
the
chief
is
right
costigan
argued
two
ways
one
we
ca
play
that
kind
of
ball
two
this
gives
them
just
enough
rope
to
hang
themselves
well
maybe
jack
was
far
from
being
convinced
but
that
the
way
it
going
to
be
so
let
call
clayton
first
costigan
broke
in
jill
will
you
please
explain
why
they
have
to
waste
as
big
a
man
as
kinnison
on
such
a
piffling
job
as
president
i
was
out
in
the
sticks
you
know
it
does
make
sense
because
he
the
only
man
alive
who
can
lick
morgan
machine
at
the
polls
jill
stated
a
simple
fact
the
patrol
can
get
along
without
him
for
one
term
after
that
it
wo
make
any
difference
but
morgan
works
from
the
why
could
he
the
psychology
is
entirely
different
morgan
a
boss
pops
kinnison
is
he
a
leader
see
oh
i
guess
so
yes
go
ahead
outwardly
new
york
spaceport
did
not
change
appreciably
at
any
given
moment
of
day
or
night
there
were
so
many
hundreds
of
persons
strolling
aimlessly
or
walking
purposefully
about
that
an
extra
hundred
or
so
made
no
perceptible
difference
and
the
spaceport
was
only
the
the
patrol
activities
began
hundreds
or
thousands
or
millions
or
billions
of
miles
away
from
earth
metropolis
a
web
was
set
up
through
which
not
even
a
meteorite
could
pass
undetected
every
bound
for
earth
carried
at
least
one
passenger
who
would
not
otherwise
have
been
aboard
passengers
who
if
not
wearing
lenses
carried
service
special
equipment
amply
sufficient
for
the
work
in
hand
geigers
and
other
vastly
more
complicated
mechanisms
flew
toward
earth
from
every
direction
in
space
streamed
toward
new
york
in
earth
every
channel
of
traffic
every
train
and
plane
every
bus
and
boat
and
car
every
conveyance
of
every
kind
and
every
pedestrian
approaching
new
york
city
was
searched
with
a
search
as
thorough
as
it
was
unobtrusive
and
every
thing
and
every
entity
approaching
new
york
spaceport
was
combed
literally
by
the
cubic
millimeter
no
arrests
were
made
no
package
was
confiscated
or
even
disturbed
throughout
the
ranks
of
public
check
boxes
in
private
offices
or
in
elaborate
or
casual
as
far
as
the
enemy
knew
the
patrol
had
no
suspicion
whatever
that
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
was
going
on
that
is
until
the
last
possible
minute
then
a
tall
lean
veteran
spoke
softly
aloud
as
though
to
himself
blocks
interference
umbrella
on
report
that
voice
low
and
soft
as
it
was
was
picked
up
by
every
service
special
receiver
within
a
radius
of
a
thousand
miles
and
by
every
lensman
listening
wherever
he
might
be
so
were
in
a
matter
of
seconds
the
replies
blocks
on
sir
interference
on
sir
umbrella
on
sir
no
could
be
driven
into
any
part
of
the
tremendous
port
no
beam
communicator
or
detonating
could
operate
anywhere
near
it
the
enemy
would
now
know
that
something
had
gone
wrong
but
he
would
not
be
able
to
do
anything
about
it
reports
received
the
tanned
man
said
still
quietly
operation
zunk
will
proceed
as
scheduled
and
four
hundred
seventy
one
highly
skilled
men
carrying
duplicate
keys
whatever
other
specialized
apparatus
and
equipment
would
be
necessary
quietly
took
possession
of
four
hundred
seventy
one
objects
of
almost
that
many
shapes
and
sizes
and
out
in
the
gathering
crowd
a
few
disturbances
occurred
and
a
few
ambulances
dashed
busily
here
and
there
some
women
had
fainted
no
doubt
ran
the
report
they
always
did
and
conway
costigan
who
had
been
watching
without
seeming
even
to
look
at
him
a
porter
loading
a
truck
with
from
a
locker
followed
man
and
truck
out
into
the
concourse
closing
up
he
asked
where
are
you
taking
that
baggage
charley
up
ramp
one
boss
came
the
unflurried
reply
flight
ninety
will
be
late
taking
off
on
accounta
this
jamboree
and
they
want
it
right
up
there
handy
take
it
down
to
the
over
the
years
a
good
many
men
had
tried
to
catch
conway
costigan
off
guard
or
napping
to
beat
him
to
the
punch
or
to
the
draw
with
a
startlingly
uniform
lack
of
success
the
lensman
fist
traveled
a
bare
seven
inches
the
supposed
porter
gasped
once
and
traveled
or
rather
staggered
backward
approximately
seven
feet
before
he
collapsed
and
sprawled
unconscious
upon
the
pavement
decontamination
costigan
remarked
apparently
to
empty
air
as
he
picked
the
fellow
up
and
draped
him
limply
over
the
truckful
of
suitcases
deke
front
and
center
area
class
hotter
than
the
middle
tailrace
of
hell
you
called
deke
a
man
came
running
up
six
nineteen
this
it
check
it
yours
porter
and
all
take
it
away
costigan
strolled
on
until
he
met
jack
kinnison
who
had
a
mouse
under
his
left
eye
how
did
happen
jack
he
demanded
sharply
something
slip
not
exactly
kinnison
grinned
ruefully
i
have
the
luck
a
woman
an
old
lady
at
that
thought
i
was
staging
a
and
swung
on
me
with
her
southpaw
and
from
the
rear
and
if
you
laugh
you
untuneful
harp
i
hang
one
right
on
the
end
of
your
chin
so
help
me
far
be
it
from
such
costigan
assured
him
and
did
not
quite
laugh
wonder
how
we
came
out
they
should
have
reported
before
this
here
it
comes
decontamination
was
complete
operation
zunk
had
been
a
success
there
had
been
no
casualties
except
for
one
black
eye
costigan
could
not
help
adding
but
his
lens
and
his
service
specials
were
off
jack
would
have
brained
him
if
any
of
them
had
been
on
linking
arms
the
two
young
lensmen
strode
away
toward
ramp
four
which
was
to
be
their
station
this
was
the
largest
crowd
earth
had
ever
known
everybody
particularly
the
nationalists
had
wondered
why
this
climactic
political
rally
had
been
set
for
three
full
weeks
ahead
of
the
election
but
their
curiosity
had
not
been
satisfied
furthermore
this
meeting
had
been
advertised
as
no
previous
one
had
ever
been
neither
pains
nor
cash
had
been
spared
in
giving
it
the
greatest
ever
known
not
only
had
every
channel
of
communication
been
loaded
for
weeks
but
also
samms
workers
had
been
very
busily
engaged
in
starting
rumors
which
grew
as
rumors
do
into
things
which
their
own
fathers
and
mothers
could
not
recognize
and
the
baffled
nationalists
trying
to
play
the
whole
thing
down
made
matters
worse
interest
spread
from
north
america
to
the
other
continents
to
the
other
planets
and
to
the
other
solar
systems
thus
to
say
that
everybody
was
interested
in
and
was
listening
to
the
cosmocrats
grand
rally
would
not
be
too
serious
an
exaggeration
roderick
kinnison
stepped
up
to
the
battery
of
microphones
certain
screens
were
cut
fellow
entities
of
civilization
and
others
while
it
may
seem
strange
to
broadcast
a
political
rally
to
other
continents
and
to
beam
it
to
other
worlds
it
was
necessary
in
this
case
the
message
to
be
given
while
it
will
go
into
the
political
affairs
of
the
north
american
continent
of
tellus
will
deal
primarily
with
a
far
larger
thing
a
matter
which
will
be
of
paramount
importance
to
all
intelligent
beings
of
every
inhabited
world
you
know
how
to
attune
your
minds
to
mine
do
it
now
he
staggered
mentally
under
the
shock
of
encountering
practically
simultaneously
so
many
minds
but
rallied
strongly
and
went
on
via
lens
my
first
message
is
not
to
you
my
fellow
cosmocrats
nor
to
you
my
fellow
dwellers
on
earth
nor
even
to
you
my
fellow
adherents
to
civilization
but
to
the
enemy
i
do
not
mean
my
political
opponents
the
nationalists
who
are
almost
all
loyal
fellow
north
americans
i
mean
the
entities
who
are
using
the
leaders
of
that
nationalist
party
as
pawns
in
a
vastly
larger
game
i
know
enemy
that
you
are
listening
i
know
that
you
had
goon
squads
in
this
audience
to
kill
me
and
my
superior
officer
know
now
that
they
are
impotent
i
know
that
you
had
atomic
bombs
with
which
to
obliterate
this
assemblage
and
this
entire
area
they
have
been
disassembled
and
stored
i
know
that
you
had
large
supplies
of
dusts
they
now
lie
in
the
patrol
vaults
near
weehauken
all
the
devices
which
you
intended
to
employ
are
known
and
all
save
one
have
been
either
nullified
or
confiscated
that
one
exception
is
your
a
force
sufficient
in
your
opinion
to
wipe
out
all
the
armed
forces
of
the
galactic
patrol
you
intended
to
use
it
in
case
we
cosmocrats
win
this
forthcoming
election
you
may
decide
to
use
it
now
do
so
if
you
like
you
can
do
nothing
to
interrupt
or
to
affect
this
meeting
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
enemy
of
civilization
now
to
you
my
legitimate
audience
i
am
not
here
to
deliver
the
address
promised
you
but
merely
to
introduce
the
real
speaker
first
lensman
virgil
samms
a
mental
gasp
millions
strong
made
itself
tellingly
felt
yes
first
lensman
samms
of
whom
you
all
know
he
has
not
been
attending
political
meetings
because
we
his
advisers
would
not
let
him
why
here
are
the
facts
through
archibald
isaacson
of
interstellar
spaceways
he
was
offered
a
bribe
which
would
in
a
few
years
have
amounted
to
some
fifty
billion
credits
more
wealth
than
any
individual
entity
has
ever
possessed
then
there
was
an
attempt
at
murder
which
we
were
able
just
barely
to
block
knowing
there
was
no
other
place
on
earth
where
he
would
be
safe
we
took
him
to
the
hill
you
know
what
happened
you
know
what
condition
the
hill
is
in
now
this
warfare
was
ascribed
to
pirates
the
whole
stupendous
operation
however
was
made
in
a
vain
attempt
to
kill
one
man
virgil
samms
the
enemy
knew
and
we
learned
that
samms
is
the
greatest
man
who
has
ever
lived
his
name
will
last
as
long
as
civilization
endures
for
it
is
he
and
he
who
can
make
it
possible
for
civilization
endure
why
was
i
not
killed
why
was
i
allowed
to
keep
on
making
campaign
speeches
because
i
do
not
count
i
am
of
no
more
importance
to
the
cause
of
civilization
than
is
my
opponent
witherspoon
to
that
of
the
enemy
i
am
a
a
plugger
you
all
know
me
rod
kinnison
the
egg
i
got
guts
enough
to
stand
up
and
fight
for
what
i
is
right
i
got
the
guts
and
the
inclination
to
stand
up
and
slug
it
out
toe
to
toe
with
man
beast
or
devil
i
would
make
and
will
make
a
good
president
i
got
the
guts
and
inclination
to
keep
on
slugging
after
you
elect
me
before
god
i
promise
to
smash
down
every
crook
who
tries
to
hold
any
part
of
our
government
down
in
the
reeking
muck
in
which
it
now
is
i
am
a
plugger
and
a
slugger
with
no
spark
of
the
terrific
flame
of
inspirational
genius
which
makes
virgil
samms
what
he
so
uniquely
is
my
may
be
important
but
i
individually
am
not
there
are
many
of
us
if
they
had
killed
me
another
slugger
would
have
taken
my
place
and
the
effect
upon
the
job
would
have
been
nil
virgil
samms
however
not
be
and
the
enemy
knows
it
he
is
unique
in
all
history
no
one
else
can
do
his
job
if
he
is
killed
before
the
principles
for
which
he
is
working
are
firmly
established
civilization
will
collapse
back
into
barbarism
it
will
not
recover
until
another
such
mind
comes
into
existence
the
probability
of
which
occurrence
i
will
let
you
compute
for
yourselves
for
those
reasons
virgil
samms
is
not
here
in
person
nor
is
he
in
the
hill
since
the
enemy
may
now
possess
weapons
powerful
enough
to
destroy
not
only
that
hitherto
impregnable
fortress
but
also
the
whole
earth
and
they
would
destroy
earth
without
a
qualm
if
in
so
doing
they
could
kill
the
first
lensman
therefore
samms
is
now
out
in
deep
space
our
fleet
is
waiting
to
be
attacked
if
we
win
the
galactic
patrol
will
go
on
if
we
lose
we
hope
you
shall
have
learned
enough
so
that
we
will
not
have
died
uselessly
die
why
should
die
are
safe
on
earth
ah
one
of
the
goons
sent
that
thought
if
our
fleet
is
defeated
no
lensman
anywhere
will
live
a
week
the
enemy
will
see
to
that
that
is
all
from
me
stay
tuned
come
in
first
lensman
virgil
samms
take
over
sir
it
was
psychologically
impossible
for
virgil
samms
to
use
such
language
as
kinnison
had
just
employed
nor
was
it
either
necessary
or
desirable
that
he
should
the
ground
had
been
prepared
therefore
coldly
impersonally
logically
tellingly
he
told
the
whole
terrific
story
he
revealed
the
most
important
things
dug
up
by
the
indefatigable
investigators
reciting
names
places
dates
transactions
and
amounts
only
in
the
last
couple
of
minutes
did
he
warm
up
at
all
nor
is
this
in
any
sense
a
smear
campaign
or
a
bringing
of
baseless
charges
to
becloud
the
issue
or
to
vilify
without
cause
and
upon
the
very
eve
of
election
a
political
opponent
these
are
facts
formal
charges
are
now
being
preferred
every
person
mentioned
and
many
others
will
be
put
under
arrest
as
soon
as
possible
if
any
one
of
them
were
in
any
degree
innocent
our
case
against
him
could
be
made
to
fall
in
less
than
the
three
weeks
intervening
before
election
day
that
is
why
this
meeting
is
being
held
at
this
time
not
one
of
them
is
innocent
being
guilty
and
knowing
that
we
can
and
will
prove
guilt
they
will
adopt
a
policy
of
delay
and
recrimination
since
our
courts
are
for
the
most
part
just
the
accused
will
be
able
to
delay
the
trials
and
the
actual
presentation
of
evidence
until
after
election
day
forewarned
however
you
will
know
exactly
why
the
trials
will
have
been
delayed
and
in
spite
of
the
fog
of
misrepresentation
you
will
know
where
the
truth
lies
you
will
know
how
to
cast
your
votes
you
will
vote
for
roderick
kinnison
and
for
those
who
support
him
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
enlarge
upon
the
character
of
port
admiral
kinnison
you
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
honest
incorruptible
fearless
you
know
that
he
will
make
the
best
president
we
have
ever
had
if
you
do
not
already
know
it
ask
any
one
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
strong
able
young
men
and
women
who
have
served
under
him
in
our
armed
forces
i
thank
you
everyone
who
has
listened
for
your
interest
chapter
as
long
as
they
were
commodores
clayton
of
north
america
and
schweikert
of
europe
had
stayed
fairly
close
to
the
home
planet
except
for
infrequent
vacation
trips
with
the
formation
of
the
galactic
patrol
however
and
their
becoming
admiral
and
of
the
first
galactic
region
and
their
acquisition
of
lenses
the
radius
of
their
sphere
of
action
was
tremendously
increased
one
or
the
other
of
them
was
always
to
be
found
in
grand
fleet
headquarters
at
new
york
spaceport
but
only
very
seldom
were
both
of
them
there
at
once
and
if
the
absentee
were
not
to
be
found
on
earth
what
of
it
the
first
galactic
region
included
all
of
the
solar
systems
and
all
of
the
planets
adherent
to
civilization
and
the
absentee
could
as
a
matter
of
business
and
duty
be
practically
anywhere
usually
however
he
was
not
upon
any
of
the
planets
but
upon
bennett
getting
acquainted
with
the
officers
supervising
the
drilling
of
grand
fleet
in
new
maneuvers
teaching
classes
in
advanced
strategy
and
holding
generally
it
was
hard
work
and
not
too
inspiring
but
in
the
end
it
paid
off
big
they
knew
their
men
their
men
knew
them
they
could
work
together
with
a
snap
a
smoothness
a
precision
otherwise
impossible
for
imported
top
brass
unknown
to
and
unacquainted
with
the
body
of
command
can
not
have
and
does
not
expect
the
deep
regard
and
the
earned
respect
so
necessary
to
high
morale
clayton
and
schweikert
had
both
they
started
early
enough
worked
hard
enough
and
had
enough
stuff
to
earn
both
thus
it
came
about
that
when
upon
a
scheduled
day
the
two
admirals
came
to
bennett
together
they
were
greeted
as
enthusiastically
as
though
they
had
been
bennettans
born
and
bred
and
their
welcome
became
a
celebration
when
clayton
issued
the
orders
which
all
bennett
had
been
waiting
so
long
and
so
impatiently
to
hear
bennettans
were
at
last
to
leave
bennett
group
after
group
after
the
component
units
of
the
galactic
patrol
grand
fleet
took
off
they
assembled
in
space
they
maneuvered
enough
to
shake
themselves
down
into
some
semblance
of
unity
they
practiced
the
new
maneuvers
they
blasted
off
in
formation
for
sol
and
as
the
tremendous
armada
neared
the
solar
system
it
met
or
rather
was
joined
by
the
patrol
ships
about
which
morgan
and
his
minions
already
knew
each
of
which
fitted
itself
into
its
place
every
planet
of
civilization
had
sent
its
every
vessel
capable
of
putting
out
a
screen
or
of
throwing
a
beam
but
so
immense
was
the
number
of
warships
in
grand
fleet
that
this
increment
great
as
it
intrinsically
was
made
no
perceptible
difference
in
its
size
on
rally
day
grand
fleet
lay
poised
near
earth
as
soon
as
he
had
introduced
samms
to
the
intensely
interested
listeners
at
the
rally
roderick
kinnison
disappeared
actually
he
drove
a
bug
to
a
distant
corner
of
the
spaceport
and
left
the
earth
in
a
light
cruiser
but
to
all
intents
and
purposes
so
engrossed
was
everyone
in
what
samms
was
saying
kinnison
simply
vanished
samms
was
already
in
the
the
port
admiral
went
out
to
his
old
flagship
the
nor
in
case
any
observer
of
the
enemy
should
be
trying
to
keep
track
of
him
could
his
course
be
traced
cleveland
and
northrop
and
rularion
and
all
they
needed
of
the
vast
resources
of
the
patrol
saw
to
that
neither
samms
nor
kinnison
had
any
business
being
with
grand
fleet
in
person
of
course
and
both
knew
it
but
everyone
knew
why
they
were
there
and
were
glad
that
the
two
top
lensmen
had
decided
to
live
or
die
with
their
fleet
if
grand
fleet
won
they
would
probably
live
if
grand
fleet
lost
they
would
certainly
die
if
not
in
the
pyrotechnic
dissolution
of
their
ships
then
in
a
matter
of
days
upon
the
ground
with
the
fleet
their
presence
would
contribute
markedly
to
morale
it
was
a
chance
very
much
worth
taking
nor
were
clayton
and
schweikert
together
or
even
near
each
other
samms
kinnison
and
the
two
admirals
were
as
far
away
from
each
other
as
they
could
get
and
still
remain
in
grand
fleet
fighting
cylinder
cylinder
yes
the
patrol
board
of
strategy
assuming
that
the
enemy
would
attack
in
conventional
cone
formation
and
knowing
that
one
cone
could
defeat
another
only
after
a
long
and
costly
engagement
had
long
since
spent
months
and
months
at
in
their
tactical
tanks
in
search
of
a
better
formation
they
had
found
it
theoretically
a
cylinder
of
proper
composition
could
defeat
with
negligible
loss
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
best
cones
they
were
able
to
devise
the
drawback
was
that
the
ships
composing
a
theoretically
efficient
cylinder
would
have
to
be
highly
specialized
and
vastly
greater
in
number
than
any
one
power
had
ever
been
able
to
put
into
the
ether
however
with
all
the
resources
of
bennett
devoted
to
construction
this
difficulty
would
not
be
insuperable
this
of
course
brought
up
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
cylinder
met
cylinder
if
the
black
strategists
should
also
have
arrived
at
the
same
solution
and
this
question
remained
unanswered
or
rather
there
were
too
many
answers
no
two
of
which
agreed
like
those
to
the
classical
one
of
what
would
happen
if
an
irresistible
force
should
strike
an
immovable
object
there
would
be
a
lot
of
intensely
interesting
even
rularion
of
jove
did
not
come
up
with
a
definite
solution
nor
did
bergenholm
who
although
a
comparatively
obscure
young
and
not
a
member
of
the
galactic
council
was
frequently
called
into
consultation
because
of
his
unique
ability
to
arrive
at
correct
conclusions
via
some
obscurely
process
of
thought
well
port
admiral
kinnison
had
concluded
finally
they
got
one
too
we
just
have
to
shorten
ours
up
widen
it
out
and
pray
clayton
to
port
admiral
kinnison
came
a
communication
through
channels
have
you
any
additional
orders
or
instructions
kinnison
to
admiral
clayton
none
the
port
admiral
replied
as
formally
then
went
on
via
lens
no
comment
or
criticism
to
make
alex
you
fellows
have
done
a
job
so
far
and
you
keep
on
doing
one
how
much
detection
have
you
got
out
twelve
detets
three
globes
of
diesels
if
we
sit
here
and
do
nothing
the
boys
will
get
edgy
and
go
stale
so
if
you
and
virge
agree
give
some
practice
lord
knows
they
need
it
and
it
keep
on
their
toes
but
about
the
blacks
they
may
be
figuring
on
delaying
any
action
until
we
had
time
to
crack
from
boredom
what
your
idea
on
that
i
been
worried
about
the
same
thing
practice
will
help
but
whether
enough
or
not
i
do
know
what
do
you
think
virge
will
they
hold
it
up
deliberately
or
strike
fast
fast
the
first
lensman
replied
promptly
and
definitely
as
soon
as
they
possibly
can
for
several
reasons
they
do
know
our
real
strength
any
more
than
we
know
theirs
they
undoubtedly
believe
however
the
same
as
we
do
that
they
are
more
efficient
than
we
are
and
have
the
larger
force
by
their
own
need
of
practice
they
will
know
ours
they
do
not
attach
nearly
as
much
importance
to
morale
as
we
do
by
the
very
nature
of
their
regime
they
ca
also
our
open
challenge
will
tend
very
definitely
to
force
their
hands
since
is
even
more
important
to
them
than
it
is
to
us
they
will
strike
as
soon
as
they
can
and
as
hard
as
they
can
grand
fleet
maneuvers
were
begun
but
in
a
day
or
so
the
alarms
came
blasting
in
the
enemy
had
been
detected
coming
in
as
the
previous
black
fleet
had
come
from
the
direction
of
coma
berenices
calculating
machines
clicked
and
whirred
orders
were
flashed
and
a
brief
string
of
numbers
ships
by
the
hundreds
and
the
thousands
flashed
into
their
assigned
positions
or
more
precisely
into
them
most
of
the
navigators
and
pilots
had
not
had
enough
practice
yet
to
hit
their
assigned
positions
exactly
on
the
first
try
since
a
radical
change
in
axial
direction
was
involved
but
they
did
pretty
well
a
few
minutes
of
juggling
and
jockeying
were
enough
clayton
and
schweikert
used
a
little
caustic
language
via
lens
and
to
their
fellow
lensmen
only
of
course
but
samms
and
kinnison
were
well
enough
pleased
the
time
of
formation
had
been
very
satisfactorily
short
and
the
cone
was
smooth
symmetrical
and
of
beautifully
uniform
density
the
preliminary
formation
was
a
cone
not
a
cylinder
it
was
not
a
conventional
cone
of
battle
in
that
it
was
not
of
standard
composition
was
too
big
and
had
altogether
too
many
ships
for
its
size
it
was
however
of
the
conventional
shape
and
it
was
believed
that
by
the
time
the
enemy
could
perceive
any
significant
differences
it
would
be
too
late
for
him
to
do
anything
about
it
the
cylinder
would
be
forming
about
that
time
anyway
and
it
was
almost
believed
at
least
it
was
strongly
hoped
that
the
enemy
would
not
have
the
time
or
the
knowledge
or
the
equipment
to
do
anything
about
that
either
kinnison
grinned
to
himself
as
his
mind
en
rapport
with
clayton
watched
the
enemy
cone
of
battle
enlarge
upon
the
admiral
conning
plate
it
was
big
and
powerful
the
galactic
patrol
forces
would
have
stood
exactly
the
chance
of
the
proverbial
snowball
in
the
nether
regions
it
was
not
however
the
port
admiral
thought
big
enough
to
form
an
efficient
cylinder
or
to
handle
the
real
force
in
any
fashion
and
unless
they
shifted
within
the
next
second
or
two
it
would
be
too
late
for
the
enemy
to
do
anything
at
all
as
though
by
magic
about
percent
of
the
patrol
tremendous
cone
changed
into
a
double
cylinder
this
maneuver
was
much
simpler
than
the
previous
one
and
had
been
practiced
to
perfection
the
mouth
of
the
cone
closed
in
and
lengthened
the
closed
end
opened
out
and
shortened
tractors
and
pressors
leaped
from
ship
to
ship
binding
the
whole
myriad
of
hitherto
discrete
units
into
a
single
structure
as
solid
even
comparatively
as
to
size
as
a
cantilever
bridge
and
instead
of
remaining
quiescent
waiting
to
be
attacked
the
cylinder
flashed
forward
inertialess
at
maximum
blast
throughout
the
years
the
violence
intensity
and
sheer
brute
power
of
offensive
weapons
had
increased
steadily
defensive
armament
had
kept
step
one
fundamental
fact
however
had
not
changed
throughout
the
ages
and
has
not
changed
yet
three
or
more
units
of
given
power
have
always
been
able
to
conquer
one
unit
of
the
same
power
if
engagement
could
be
forced
and
no
assistance
could
be
given
and
two
units
could
practically
always
do
so
fundamentally
therefore
strategy
always
has
been
and
still
is
the
development
of
new
artifices
and
techniques
by
virtue
of
which
two
or
more
of
our
units
may
attack
one
of
theirs
the
while
affording
the
minimum
of
opportunity
for
them
to
retaliate
in
kind
the
patrol
grand
fleet
flashed
forward
almost
exactly
along
the
axis
of
the
black
cone
right
where
the
enemy
wanted
it
or
so
he
thought
straight
into
the
yawning
mouth
erupting
now
a
blast
of
flame
beside
which
the
wildest
imaginings
of
inferno
must
pale
into
insignificance
straight
along
that
raging
axis
toward
the
apex
at
the
terrific
speed
of
the
two
directly
opposed
velocities
of
flight
but
to
the
complete
consternation
of
the
black
high
command
nothing
much
happened
for
as
has
been
pointed
out
that
cylinder
was
not
of
even
approximately
normal
composition
in
fact
there
was
not
a
normal
in
it
the
outer
skin
and
both
ends
of
the
cylinder
were
purely
defensive
those
vessels
packed
so
closely
that
their
repellor
fields
actually
touched
were
all
screen
none
of
them
had
a
beam
hot
enough
to
light
a
match
conversely
the
inner
layer
or
liner
was
composed
of
vessels
that
were
practically
all
offense
they
had
to
be
protected
at
every
point
but
how
they
could
ladle
it
out
the
leading
and
trailing
edges
of
the
formation
the
ends
of
the
gigantic
pipe
so
to
speak
would
of
course
bear
the
brunt
of
the
black
attack
and
it
was
this
factor
that
had
given
the
strategists
the
most
serious
concern
wherefore
the
first
ten
and
the
last
six
double
rings
of
ships
were
special
indeed
they
were
screen
nothing
else
they
were
drones
operated
by
remote
control
carrying
no
living
thing
if
the
patrol
losses
could
be
held
to
eight
double
rings
of
ships
at
the
first
pass
and
four
at
the
second
theoretical
computations
indicated
losses
of
six
and
two
samms
and
his
fellows
would
be
well
content
all
of
the
patrol
ships
had
of
course
the
standard
equipment
of
violet
green
and
red
fields
as
well
as
duodecaplylatomate
and
ordinary
atomic
bombs
dirigible
torpedoes
and
transporters
slicers
polycyclic
drills
and
so
on
but
in
this
battle
the
principal
reliance
was
to
be
placed
upon
the
sheer
brutal
overwhelming
power
of
what
had
been
called
the
macro
beam
now
simply
the
beam
furthermore
in
the
incredibly
incandescent
frenzy
of
the
chosen
field
of
action
the
cylinder
was
to
attack
the
cone
at
its
very
strongest
part
no
conceivable
material
projectile
could
have
lasted
a
single
microsecond
after
leaving
the
screens
of
force
of
its
parent
vessel
it
could
have
flown
fast
enough
trackers
could
have
steered
it
rapidly
enough
and
accurately
enough
but
before
it
could
have
traveled
a
foot
even
at
speed
it
would
have
ceased
utterly
to
be
it
would
have
been
resolved
into
its
constituent
particles
and
waves
nothing
material
could
exist
except
instantaneously
in
the
field
of
force
filling
the
axis
of
the
black
cone
of
battle
a
field
beside
which
the
exact
center
of
a
flash
of
lightning
would
constitute
a
dead
area
that
field
however
encountered
no
material
object
the
screeners
packed
so
closely
as
to
have
a
four
hundred
percent
overlap
had
been
designed
to
withstand
precisely
that
inconceivable
environment
practically
all
of
them
withstood
it
and
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
the
hollow
forward
end
of
the
cylinder
engulfed
the
entire
apex
of
the
enemy
and
the
hitherto
idle
sluggers
of
the
cylinder
liner
went
to
work
each
of
those
vessels
had
one
heavy
pressor
beam
each
having
the
same
push
as
every
other
directed
inward
toward
the
cylinder
axis
and
backward
at
an
angle
of
fifteen
degrees
from
the
perpendicular
line
between
ship
and
axis
therefore
wherever
any
black
ship
entered
the
patrol
cylinder
or
however
it
was
driven
to
and
held
at
the
axis
and
forced
backward
along
that
axis
none
of
them
however
got
very
far
they
were
perforce
in
single
file
one
ship
opposing
at
least
one
solid
ring
of
giant
sluggers
who
did
not
have
to
concern
themselves
with
defense
but
could
pour
every
iota
of
their
tremendous
resources
into
offensive
beams
thus
the
odds
were
not
merely
two
or
three
to
one
but
never
less
than
eighty
and
very
frequently
over
two
hundred
to
one
under
the
impact
of
those
unimaginable
torrents
of
force
the
screens
of
the
engulfed
vessels
flashed
once
practically
instantaneously
through
the
spectrum
and
went
down
whether
they
had
two
or
three
or
four
courses
made
no
difference
in
fact
even
the
analyzers
of
the
observers
could
not
tell
then
a
couple
of
microseconds
later
the
the
strongest
fabrics
of
force
developed
by
man
up
to
that
time
also
failed
then
those
ravenous
fields
of
force
struck
bare
unprotected
metal
and
every
molecule
inorganic
and
organic
of
ships
and
contents
alike
disappeared
in
a
bursting
flare
of
energy
so
raw
and
so
violent
as
to
stagger
even
those
who
had
brought
it
into
existence
it
was
certainly
vastly
more
than
a
mere
volatilization
it
was
deduced
later
that
the
detonating
unstable
isotopes
of
the
own
bombs
in
the
frightful
temperatures
already
existing
in
the
patrol
beams
had
initiated
a
chain
reaction
which
had
resulted
in
the
fissioning
of
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
atomic
nuclei
of
usually
completely
stable
elements
the
cylinder
stopped
the
lensmen
took
stock
the
depth
of
erosion
of
the
leading
edge
had
averaged
almost
exactly
six
double
rings
of
drones
in
places
the
sixth
ring
was
still
intact
in
others
which
had
encountered
unusually
concentrated
beaming
the
seventh
was
gone
also
a
fraction
of
one
percent
of
the
manned
had
disappeared
brief
though
the
time
of
engagement
had
been
the
enemy
had
been
able
to
concentrate
enough
beams
to
burn
a
few
holes
through
the
walls
of
the
attacking
cylinder
it
had
not
been
hoped
that
more
than
a
few
hundreds
of
black
vessels
could
be
blown
out
of
the
ether
at
this
first
pass
general
staff
had
been
sure
however
that
the
heaviest
and
most
dangerous
ships
including
those
carrying
the
enemy
high
command
would
be
among
them
the
of
the
apex
of
the
conventional
cone
of
battle
had
always
been
the
safest
place
to
be
therefore
that
was
where
the
black
admirals
had
been
and
therefore
they
no
longer
lived
in
a
few
seconds
it
became
clear
that
if
any
black
high
command
existed
it
was
not
in
shape
to
function
efficiently
some
of
the
enemy
ships
were
still
blasting
with
little
or
no
concerted
effort
at
the
regulation
cone
which
the
cylinder
had
left
behind
a
few
were
attempting
to
get
into
some
kind
of
a
formation
possibly
to
attack
the
patrol
cylinder
indecision
was
visible
and
rampant
to
turn
that
tremendous
cylindrical
engine
of
destruction
around
would
have
been
a
task
of
hours
but
it
was
not
necessary
instead
each
vessel
cut
its
tractors
and
pressors
spun
end
for
end
reconnected
and
retraced
almost
exactly
its
previous
course
cutting
out
and
blasting
into
nothingness
another
plug
of
black
warships
another
reversal
another
dash
and
this
time
so
disorganized
were
the
foes
and
so
feeble
the
beaming
not
a
single
patrol
vessel
was
lost
the
black
fleet
so
proud
and
so
conquering
of
mien
a
few
minutes
before
had
fallen
completely
apart
that
enough
rod
do
you
think
samms
thought
then
please
order
clayton
to
cease
action
so
that
we
can
hold
a
parley

their
senior

a
snarl

up

themselves

damned
beyond
a
certain
point
military
action
becomes
indefensible
butchery
of
which
our

never
be
guilty
that
point
has
now
been
reached
if
you
do
not

our

you

samms
voice

steady
his

we

not
barbarians

does
not
the
fact
that
we
ceased

so
soon
mean
anything
to
you
for
the

the

changed
subtly
and

pressed
the

i
see
it
does
now
if
you
will
converse
with

mind

the

felt

began
to

but
this
was
too
much
i

not
the

i
will
have
nothing

oh
what
the

snapped
let
get

a
great

samms
replied
quietly
this
is
a
i
be
right
i
be
that
far
wrong
and
he
again
turned
his

to
the
enemy
commander
very
well
sir
we
will
continue
to
use

i
repeat
please
come

you
will
not
be
asked
to

you
will
retain

you
make
no

them
whether
or
not
we
come
to
any

you
will
be

you

it
as

in

of
the
highest

of
the

i
swear
it
we
will
come

very
well
i
will
have
ten

here
with

the

followed
by

of
the

port
admiral
kinnison
and
nine
other

joined

in
the
con
room
the
tight
formation
of
eleven
patrol
ships
blasted
in
unison
in
the
of
meeting
the
equally
tight
formation
of
black
warships
in
the
matter
of
intrinsic
velocity
soon
the
two
little
were
motionless
in
respect
to
each
other
eleven
black
gigs
were
launched
eleven
black
came
aboard
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
full
military
honors
customarily
granted
to
visiting
admirals
of
friendly
powers
each
was
armed
with
what
seemed
to
be
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
patrol
own
current
blaster
lewiston
mark
seventeen
in
the
lead
strode
the
tall
heavy
man
with
whom
samms
had
been
dealing
still
defiant
still
sullen
still
concealing
sternly
his
sheer
desperation
his
block
was
still
on
full
strength
the
man
next
in
line
was
much
younger
than
the
leader
much
less
wrought
up
much
more
intent
samms
felt
for
this
man
ego
tuned
to
it
and
got
the
shock
of
his
life
this
black
mind
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
expected
to
encounter
it
was
in
every
respect
of
lensman
grade
oh
how
you
are
not
speaking
and
i
see
the
lens
the
lens
the
stranger
mind
was
for
seconds
an
utterly
indescribable
turmoil
in
which
relief
gladness
and
high
anticipation
struggled
for
supremacy
in
the
next
few
seconds
even
before
the
visitors
had
reached
their
places
at
the
conference
table
virgil
samms
and
corander
of
petrine
exchanged
thoughts
which
would
require
many
thousands
of
words
to
express
only
a
few
of
which
are
necessary
here
the
lens
i
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
without
hope
of
realization
or
possibility
we
have
been
misled
they
are
then
actually
available
upon
your
world
samms
of
tellus
not
exactly
and
not
at
all
generally
and
samms
explained
as
he
had
explained
so
many
times
before
you
will
wear
one
sooner
than
you
think
but
as
to
ending
this
warfare
you
survivors
are
practically
all
natives
of
your
own
world
petrine
not
we
are
petrinos
all
the
were
all
in
the
center
many
remain
upon
petrine
and
its
neighboring
worlds
but
none
remain
alive
here
ohlanser
then
who
assumed
command
is
also
a
petrino
so
i
had
assumed
otherwise
he
will
be
a
is
he
actually
in
supreme
command
only
by
and
with
our
consent
under
such
astounding
circumstances
as
these
he
is
a
reactionary
of
the
old
school
he
would
ordinarily
be
in
supreme
command
and
would
be
supported
by
the
teachers
if
any
were
here
but
i
will
challenge
his
authority
and
theirs
standing
upon
my
right
to
command
my
own
fleet
as
i
see
fit
so
will
i
think
several
others
so
go
ahead
with
your
meeting
be
seated
gentlemen
all
saluted
punctiliously
and
sat
down
now
ohlanser
how
do
you
a
stranger
know
my
name
i
know
many
things
we
have
a
suggestion
to
offer
which
if
you
petrinos
will
follow
it
will
end
this
warfare
first
please
believe
that
we
have
no
designs
upon
your
planet
nor
any
quarrel
with
any
of
its
people
who
are
not
hopelessly
contaminated
by
the
ideas
and
the
culture
of
the
entities
who
are
back
of
this
whole
movement
quite
possibly
those
whom
you
refer
to
as
the
you
did
not
know
whom
you
were
to
fight
or
why
this
was
a
statement
with
no
hint
of
question
about
it
i
see
now
that
we
did
not
know
all
the
truth
ohlanser
admitted
stiffly
we
were
informed
and
given
proof
sufficient
to
make
us
believe
that
you
were
monsters
from
outer
space
rapacious
insatiable
senselessly
and
callously
destructive
to
all
other
forms
of
intelligent
life
we
suspected
something
of
the
kind
do
you
others
agree
corander
yes
we
were
shown
detailed
and
documented
proofs
stereos
of
battles
in
which
no
quarter
was
given
we
saw
system
after
system
conquered
world
after
world
laid
waste
we
were
made
to
believe
that
our
only
hope
of
continued
existence
was
to
meet
you
and
destroy
you
in
space
for
if
you
were
allowed
to
reach
petrine
every
man
woman
and
child
on
the
planet
would
either
be
killed
outright
or
tortured
to
death
i
see
now
that
those
proofs
were
entirely
false
completely
vicious
they
were
those
who
spread
that
lying
propaganda
and
all
who
support
their
organization
must
be
and
shall
be
weeded
out
petrine
must
be
and
shall
be
given
her
rightful
place
in
the
galactic
fellowship
of
free
independent
and
cooperative
worlds
so
must
any
and
all
planets
whose
peoples
wish
to
adhere
to
civilization
instead
of
to
tyranny
and
despotism
to
further
these
ends
we
lensmen
suggest
that
you
your
fleet
and
proceed
to
arisia
arisia
ohlanser
did
not
like
the
idea
arisia
samms
insisted
upon
leaving
arisia
knowing
vastly
more
than
you
do
now
you
will
return
to
your
home
planet
where
you
will
take
whatever
steps
you
will
then
know
to
be
necessary
we
were
told
that
your
lenses
are
hypnotic
devices
ohlanser
sneered
designed
to
steal
away
and
destroy
the
minds
of
any
who
listen
to
you
i
believe
fully
i
will
not
go
to
arisia
nor
will
any
part
of
petrine
grand
fleet
i
will
not
attack
my
home
planet
i
will
not
do
battle
against
my
own
people
this
is
final
i
am
not
saying
or
implying
that
you
should
but
you
continue
to
close
your
mind
to
reason
how
about
you
corander
and
you
others
in
the
momentary
silence
samms
put
himself
en
rapport
with
the
other
officers
and
was
overjoyed
at
what
he
learned
i
do
not
agree
with
ohlanser
corander
said
flatly
he
commands
not
grand
fleet
but
his
merely
as
do
we
all
i
will
lead
my
to
arisia
traitor
ohlanser
shouted
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
drew
his
blaster
but
a
tractor
beam
snatched
it
from
his
grasp
before
he
could
fire
you
were
allowed
to
wear
not
to
use
them
samms
said
quietly
how
many
of
you
others
agree
with
corander
how
many
with
ohlanser
all
nine
voted
with
the
younger
man
very
well
ohlanser
you
may
either
accept
corander
leadership
or
leave
this
meeting
now
and
take
your
directly
back
to
petrine
decide
now
which
you
prefer
to
do
you
mean
you
are
going
to
kill
me
even
now
or
even
degrade
me
or
put
me
under
arrest
i
mean
exactly
that
what
is
your
decision
in
that
case
i
was
must
have
been
wrong
i
will
follow
corander
a
wise
choice
corander
you
already
know
what
to
expect
except
that
four
or
five
other
petrinos
now
in
this
room
will
help
you
not
only
in
deciding
what
must
be
done
upon
petrine
but
also
in
the
doing
of
it
this
meeting
will
adjourn
but
no
reprisals
corander
in
spite
of
his
newly
acquired
knowledge
was
dubious
almost
dumbfounded
no
invasion
or
occupation
no
indemnities
to
your
patrol
or
reparations
no
punishment
of
us
our
men
or
our
families
none
that
does
not
square
up
even
with
ordinary
military
usage
i
know
it
it
does
conform
however
to
the
policy
of
the
galactic
patrol
which
is
to
spread
throughout
our
island
universe
you
are
not
even
sending
your
fleet
or
heavy
units
of
it
with
us
to
see
to
it
that
we
follow
your
instructions
it
is
not
necessary
if
you
need
any
form
of
help
you
will
inform
us
of
your
requirements
via
lens
as
i
am
conversing
with
you
now
and
whatever
you
want
will
be
supplied
however
i
do
not
expect
any
such
call
you
and
your
fellows
are
capable
of
handling
the
situation
you
will
soon
know
the
truth
and
know
that
you
know
it
and
when
your
is
done
we
will
consider
your
application
for
representation
upon
the
galactic
council
thus
the
lensmen
particularly
first
lensman
virgil
samms
brought
another
sector
of
the
galaxy
under
the
aegis
of
civilization
chapter
after
the
rally
there
were
a
few
days
during
which
neither
samms
nor
kinnison
was
on
earth
that
the
cosmocrats
presidential
candidate
and
the
first
lensman
were
both
with
the
fleet
was
not
a
secret
in
fact
it
was
advertised
everyone
was
told
why
they
were
out
there
and
almost
everyone
approved
nor
was
their
absence
felt
developments
fast
and
terrific
were
slammed
home
cosmocratic
spellbinders
in
every
state
of
north
america
waved
the
flag
pointed
with
pride
and
viewed
with
alarm
in
the
very
best
tradition
of
north
american
politics
but
above
all
there
appeared
upon
every
and
in
every
of
the
continent
at
opening
time
of
the
day
following
rally
day
a
book
of
over
eighteen
hundred
pages
of
fine
print
a
book
the
publication
of
which
had
given
samms
himself
no
little
concern
but
i
afraid
of
it
he
had
protested
know
it
true
but
there
material
on
almost
every
page
for
the
biggest
libel
and
slander
suits
in
history
i
know
it
the
bald
and
paunchy
had
replied
fully
i
hope
they
take
action
against
us
but
i
absolutely
certain
they
wo
you
hope
they
do
yes
if
they
take
the
initiative
they
ca
prevent
us
from
presenting
our
evidence
in
full
and
there
is
no
court
in
existence
however
corrupt
before
which
we
could
not
win
what
they
want
and
must
have
is
delay
avoidance
of
any
issue
until
after
the
election
i
see
samms
was
convinced
the
location
of
the
patrol
grand
fleet
had
been
concealed
from
all
inhabitants
of
the
solarian
system
friends
and
foes
alike
but
the
climactic
battle
liberating
as
it
did
energies
sufficient
to
distort
the
very
warp
and
woof
of
the
fabric
of
space
itself
could
not
be
hidden
or
denied
or
even
belittled
it
was
not
however
advertised
or
blazoned
abroad
then
as
now
the
newshawks
wanted
to
know
instantly
and
via
communicators
vastly
more
than
those
responsible
for
security
cared
to
tell
then
as
now
the
latter
said
as
little
as
it
was
humanly
possible
to
say
everyone
knew
that
the
patrol
had
won
a
magnificent
victory
but
nobody
knew
who
or
what
the
enemy
had
been
since
the
rank
and
file
knew
it
everyone
knew
that
only
a
fraction
of
the
black
fleet
had
actually
been
destroyed
but
nobody
knew
where
the
remaining
vessels
went
or
what
they
did
everyone
knew
that
about
ninety
five
percent
of
the
astonishingly
huge
grand
fleet
had
come
from
and
was
on
its
way
back
to
the
planet
bennett
and
knew
since
bennettans
would
in
a
few
weeks
be
scampering
gaily
all
over
space
in
general
bennett
was
but
nobody
knew
it
was
thus
when
the
north
american
contingent
landed
at
new
york
spaceport
everyone
whom
the
newsmen
could
reach
was
literally
mobbed
however
in
accordance
with
the
aphorism
ascribed
to
the
wise
old
owl
those
who
knew
the
least
said
the
most
but
the
telenews
ace
who
had
once
interviewed
both
kinnison
and
samms
wasted
no
time
upon
small
fry
he
insisted
on
seeing
the
two
top
lensmen
and
kept
on
insisting
until
he
did
see
them
nothing
to
say
kinnison
said
curtly
leaving
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
meant
it
all
talking
if
any
will
be
done
by
first
lensman
samms
now
all
you
millions
of
telenews
listeners
i
am
interviewing
first
lensman
samms
himself
a
little
closer
to
the
mike
please
first
lensman
now
sir
what
everybody
wants
to
know
is
who
are
the
blacks
i
do
know
you
do
know
on
the
lens
sir
on
the
lens
i
still
do
know
i
see
but
you
have
suspicions
or
ideas
you
can
guess
i
can
guess
but
that
all
it
would
be
a
guess
and
my
guess
folks
is
that
his
guess
would
be
a
very
highly
informed
guess
will
you
tell
the
public
first
lensman
samms
what
your
guess
is
i
will
if
this
reply
astonished
the
newshawk
it
staggered
kinnison
and
the
others
who
knew
samms
best
it
was
however
a
coldly
calculated
political
move
while
it
will
probably
be
several
weeks
before
we
can
furnish
detailed
and
unassailable
proof
it
is
my
considered
opinion
that
the
black
fleet
was
built
and
controlled
by
the
machine
that
they
all
unknown
to
any
of
us
enticed
corrupted
and
seduced
a
world
or
several
worlds
to
their
program
of
domination
and
enslavement
that
they
intended
by
armed
force
to
take
over
the
continent
of
north
america
and
through
it
the
whole
earth
and
all
the
other
planets
adherent
to
civilization
that
they
intended
to
hunt
down
and
kill
every
lensman
and
to
subvert
the
galactic
council
to
their
own
ends
this
is
what
you
wanted
that
fine
sir
what
we
wanted
but
just
one
more
thing
sir
the
newsman
had
obtained
infinitely
more
than
he
had
expected
to
get
yet
good
newsmanlike
he
wanted
more
just
a
word
if
you
will
samms
as
to
these
trials
and
the
white
book
i
can
add
very
little
i
afraid
to
what
i
have
already
said
and
what
is
in
the
book
and
that
little
can
be
classed
as
told
you
so
we
are
trying
and
will
continue
to
try
to
force
those
criminals
to
trial
to
break
up
to
prohibit
an
unending
series
of
delays
we
want
and
are
determined
to
get
legal
action
to
make
each
of
those
we
have
accused
defend
himself
in
court
and
under
oath
morgan
and
his
crew
however
are
working
desperately
to
avoid
any
action
at
all
because
they
know
that
we
can
and
will
prove
every
allegation
we
have
made
the
telenews
ace
signed
off
samms
and
kinnison
went
to
their
respective
offices
and
cosmocratic
orators
throughout
the
nation
held
a
they
glowed
and
scintillated
with
triumph
they
yelled
themselves
hoarse
though
they
were
in
pointing
out
the
unsullied
purity
the
spotless
perfection
of
their
own
party
and
its
every
candidate
for
office
in
shuddering
revulsion
at
the
proved
and
demonstrated
villainy
and
blackguardy
of
the
opposition
and
the
nationalists
although
they
had
been
dealt
a
terrific
and
entirely
unexpected
blow
worked
of
politics
with
what
they
had
morgan
and
his
minions
ranted
and
raved
they
were
being
jobbed
they
were
being
crucified
by
the
monied
powers
all
those
allegations
and
charges
were
sheerest
fabrications
false
utterly
vicious
containing
nothing
whatever
of
truth
they
not
the
patrol
were
trying
to
force
a
to
vindicate
themselves
and
to
confute
those
unspeakably
unscrupulous
lensmen
before
election
day
and
they
were
succeeding
why
otherwise
had
not
a
single
one
of
the
thousands
of
accused
even
been
arrested
ask
that
lying
first
lensman
virgil
samms
ask
that
conscienceless
murderer
roderick
kinnison
but
do
not
at
peril
of
your
sanity
submit
your
minds
to
their
lenses
and
why
the
reader
asks
were
not
at
least
some
of
those
named
persons
arrested
before
election
day
and
your
historian
must
answer
frankly
that
he
does
not
know
he
is
not
a
lawyer
it
would
be
of
interest
to
some
few
of
us
to
follow
in
detail
at
least
one
of
those
days
of
legal
battling
in
one
of
the
high
courts
of
the
land
to
quote
verbatim
at
least
a
few
of
the
many
thousands
of
pages
of
transcript
but
to
most
of
us
the
technicalities
involved
would
be
boring
in
the
extreme
but
could
the
voters
tell
easily
enough
which
side
was
on
the
offensive
and
which
on
the
defensive
which
pressed
for
action
and
which
insisted
on
postponement
and
delay
they
could
have
easily
enough
if
they
had
cared
enough
about
the
basic
issues
involved
to
make
the
necessary
mental
effort
but
almost
everyone
was
too
busy
doing
something
else
and
it
was
so
much
easier
to
take
somebody
word
for
it
and
finally
is
an
exercise
to
which
all
too
few
brains
are
accustomed
but
morgan
neither
ranted
nor
raved
nor
blustered
when
he
sat
in
conference
with
his
superior
who
had
come
storming
in
as
soon
as
he
had
learned
of
the
crushing
defeat
of
the
black
fleet
the
kalonian
was
very
highly
concerned
so
much
so
that
the
undertone
of
his
peculiar
complexion
was
turning
slowly
to
a
delicate
shade
of
green
how
did
happen
how
it
happen
why
was
i
not
informed
of
the
patrol
real
power
how
could
you
be
guilty
of
such
stupidity
now
i
have
to
report
to
scrwan
of
the
eich
he
pure
undiluted
poison
and
if
word
of
this
catastrophe
ever
gets
up
to
ploor
come
down
out
of
the
stratosphere
fernald
morgan
countered
bitingly
do
try
to
make
the
goat
i
wo
sit
still
for
it
it
happened
because
they
could
build
a
bigger
fleet
than
we
could
you
were
in
on
that
all
of
it
you
knew
what
we
were
doing
and
approved
it
all
of
it
you
were
as
badly
fooled
as
i
was
you
were
not
informed
because
i
could
find
out
nothing
i
could
learn
no
more
of
their
bennett
than
they
could
of
our
petrine
as
to
reporting
you
will
of
course
do
as
you
please
but
i
would
advise
you
not
to
cry
too
much
before
you
really
hurt
this
battle
is
over
yet
my
friend
the
kalonian
had
been
a
badly
shaken
entity
it
was
a
measure
of
his
state
of
mind
that
he
did
not
liquidate
the
temerarious
tellurian
then
and
there
but
since
morgan
was
as
undisturbed
as
ever
and
as
sure
of
himself
he
began
to
regain
his
wonted
aplomb
his
color
became
again
its
normal
pale
blue
i
will
forgive
your
insubordination
this
time
since
there
were
no
witnesses
but
use
no
more
such
language
to
me
he
said
stiffly
i
fail
to
perceive
any
basis
for
your
optimism
the
only
chance
now
remaining
is
for
you
to
win
the
election
and
how
can
you
do
that
you
are
must
be
losing
ground
steadily
and
rapidly
not
as
much
as
you
might
think
morgan
pulled
down
a
large
chart
this
line
represents
the
nationalists
whom
nothing
we
can
do
will
alienate
from
the
party
this
one
the
equally
cosmocrats
the
balance
of
power
lies
as
always
with
the
independents
these
here
and
many
of
them
are
not
as
independent
as
is
supposed
we
can
buy
or
bring
pressure
to
bear
on
half
of
them
that
cuts
them
down
to
this
size
here
so
no
matter
what
the
patrol
does
it
can
affect
only
this
relatively
small
block
here
and
it
is
this
block
we
are
fighting
for
we
are
losing
a
little
ground
and
steadily
yes
since
we
ca
conceal
from
anybody
with
half
a
brain
the
fact
that
we
doing
our
best
to
keep
the
cases
from
ever
coming
to
trial
but
here
the
actual
observed
line
of
sentiment
as
determined
from
psychological
indices
up
to
yesterday
here
is
the
extrapolation
of
that
line
to
election
day
it
forecasts
us
to
get
just
under
forty
nine
percent
of
the
total
vote
and
is
there
anything
cheerful
about
that
fernald
asked
frostily
i
say
there
is
morgan
big
face
assumed
a
sneering
smile
an
expression
never
seen
by
any
voter
this
chart
deals
only
with
living
legally
registered
voters
now
if
we
can
come
that
close
to
winning
an
absolutely
honest
election
how
do
you
figure
we
can
possibly
lose
the
kind
this
one
is
going
to
be
we
in
power
you
know
we
got
this
machine
and
we
know
how
to
use
it
oh
yes
i
remember
vaguely
you
told
me
about
north
american
politics
once
a
few
years
ago
dead
men
ringers
repeaters
stuffing
and
so
on
you
said
so
on
is
right
chief
morgan
assured
him
heartily
everything
goes
this
time
it
be
one
of
the
biggest
landslides
in
north
american
history
i
will
then
defer
any
action
until
after
the
election
that
will
be
the
smart
thing
to
do
chief
then
you
wo
have
to
take
any
or
make
any
report
at
all
and
upon
this
highly
satisfactory
note
the
conference
closed
and
morgan
was
actually
as
confident
as
he
had
appeared
his
charts
were
actual
and
factual
he
knew
the
power
of
money
and
the
effectiveness
of
pressure
he
knew
the
capabilities
of
the
various
units
of
his
machine
he
did
not
however
know
two
things
jill
insidious
voters
protective
league
and
the
bright
flame
of
loyalty
pervading
the
galactic
patrol
thus
between
times
of
bellowing
and
screaming
his
speeches
he
watched
calmly
and
contentedly
the
devious
workings
of
his
smooth
and
efficient
organization
until
the
day
before
election
that
is
then
hordes
of
young
men
and
young
women
went
suddenly
and
briefly
to
work
at
least
four
in
every
precinct
of
the
entire
nation
they
visited
it
seemed
every
residence
and
every
dwelling
unit
everywhere
they
asked
questions
and
took
notes
and
vanished
and
the
machine
operatives
after
the
alarm
was
given
could
not
find
man
or
girl
or
notebook
and
the
galactic
patrol
which
had
never
before
paid
any
attention
to
elections
had
given
leave
and
ample
time
to
its
every
north
american
citizen
vessels
of
the
north
american
contingent
were
grounded
and
practically
emptied
of
personnel
bases
and
stations
were
depopulated
and
even
from
every
distant
world
every
patrolman
registered
in
any
north
american
precinct
came
to
spend
the
day
at
home
morgan
began
then
to
worry
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
the
situation
or
was
there
if
the
civilian
boys
and
girls
were
checking
the
registration
books
and
they
were
it
was
as
checkers
if
the
uniformed
boys
and
girls
were
all
coming
home
to
vote
and
they
were
that
too
was
their
inalienable
right
but
boys
and
girls
were
notoriously
prone
to
accident
and
to
debauchery
but
again
morgan
was
surprised
and
this
time
taken
heavily
aback
the
web
which
had
protected
grand
rally
so
efficiently
but
greatly
enlarged
now
was
functioning
again
and
morgan
and
his
minions
spent
a
sleepless
and
thoroughly
uncomfortable
night
election
day
dawned
clear
bright
and
cool
auguring
a
record
voting
was
early
and
extraordinarily
heavy
the
polls
were
crowded
there
was
however
very
little
disorder
surprisingly
little
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
cosmocratic
watchers
instead
of
being
the
venal
wights
of
custom
were
unreachable
men
and
women
who
seemed
to
know
by
sight
every
voter
in
the
precinct
at
least
they
spotted
on
sight
and
challenged
without
hesitation
every
ringer
every
dead
one
every
repeater
and
every
imposter
who
claimed
the
right
to
vote
and
those
challenges
being
borne
out
in
every
case
by
the
registration
lists
were
in
every
case
upheld
not
all
of
the
policemen
on
duty
especially
in
the
big
cities
were
above
suspicion
of
course
but
whenever
any
one
of
those
officers
began
to
show
a
willingness
to
play
ball
with
the
machine
a
calm
patrolman
would
remark
casually
better
see
that
this
election
stays
straight
bud
and
strictly
according
to
the
lists
and
signatures
or
you
apt
to
find
yourself
listed
in
the
big
book
along
with
the
rest
of
the
rats
it
was
not
that
the
machine
liked
the
way
things
were
going
or
that
it
did
not
have
goon
squads
on
the
job
it
was
that
there
were
everywhere
and
always
more
patrolmen
than
there
were
goons
and
those
patrolmen
however
young
in
years
some
of
them
might
have
appeared
to
be
were
veterans
fighting
men
armed
with
the
last
word
in
blasters
lewiston
mark
seventeen
to
the
boy
friends
and
neighbors
of
course
his
lewiston
was
practically
invisible
it
was
merely
an
article
of
clothing
the
same
as
his
pants
it
carried
no
more
of
significance
of
threat
or
of
menace
than
did
the
pistol
and
the
club
of
the
friendly
irish
cop
on
the
beat
but
the
goon
did
not
see
the
patrolman
as
a
friend
he
saw
the
keen
clear
sharply
discerning
eyes
the
long
strong
fingers
the
smoothly
flowing
muscles
so
eloquent
of
speed
and
of
power
he
saw
the
lewiston
for
what
it
was
the
deadliest
most
destructive
known
to
man
above
all
he
saw
the
difference
in
numbers
six
or
seven
or
eight
patrolmen
to
four
or
five
or
six
of
his
own
kind
if
more
hoods
arrived
so
did
more
spacemen
if
some
departed
so
did
a
corresponding
number
of
the
wearers
of
the
and
silver
ai
you
getting
tired
of
sticking
around
here
george

confidentially
of

patrolman
i
am
what
say

and
some
of
you
fellows
round
up
some

and
go
have
us

george
denied
his

was

and
careless
but
his
eyes
were
icy
cold
my
uncle
cousin
stepson
is
running
for

i
ca
leave
until
i
find
out
whether
he
wins
or
not
thus
nothing
happened
thus
the
invisible
but
nevertheless
terrific
tension
did
not
erupt
into
open
battle
and
thus
for
the
first
time
in
north
america
long
history
a
presidential
election
was
ninety
nine
and
ninety
nine
percent
pure
evening
came
the
polls
closed
the
cosmocrats
headquarters
for
the
day
the
grand
ballroom
of
the
hotel
van
der
voort
became
the
goal
of
every
patrolman
who
thought
he
stood
any
chance
at
all
of
getting
in
kinnison
had
been
there
all
day
of
course
so
had
joy
his
wife
who
for
lack
of
space
has
been
sadly
neglected
in
these
annals
betty
their
daughter
had
come
in
early
accompanied
by
a
husky
and
personable
young
lieutenant
who
has
no
other
place
in
this
story
jack
kinnison
arrived
with
dimples
maynard
dazzlingly
blonde
wearing
a
screamingly
red
wisp
of
silk
she
too
has
been
shamefully
slighted
here
although
she
was
never
slighted
anywhere
else
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
her
jack
was
wont
to
say
i
went
right
into
a
flat
spin
running
around
in
circles
and
biting
myself
in
the
small
of
the
back
and
could
pull
out
of
it
for
four
hours
that
miss
maynard
should
be
a
very
special
item
is
not
at
all
surprising
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
was
to
become
the
wife
of
one
of
the
kinnisons
and
the
mother
of
another
the
first
lensman
who
had
been
in
and
out
came
in
to
stay
so
did
jill
and
her
inseparable
mason
northrop
and
so
did

they

was

and
so

no
outsider
could
tell
ever
what
any
lensman
was
thinking
to
say
nothing
of
such
a
monstrous
lensman
as
dronvire
but
that
hotel
was
being
covered
as
no

had
ever
been
covered
before
the

the
cosmocrats
had
swept
the

and
in
those
two
great

they
held

commanding
lead
it
was
still
mathematically
possible
however
for

to
win

let
start

someone
shouted
and

took
up

stop

no

cut
through

noise
no

two
events
came
practically
together
witherspoon
conceded
a
couple
of
minutes
before
it
became
mathematically
impossible
for
him
to
win
then
came
the
celebration
which
went
on
and
on
interminably
at
the
first
opportunity
however
kinnison
took
samms
by
the
arm
led
him
without
a
word
into
a
small
office
and
shut
the
door
samms
also
saying
nothing
sat
down
in
the
swivel
chair
put
both
feet
up
on
the
desk
lit

and
inhaled

kinnison
broke

silence
at

at

no
more
than
his

did
he
dare
to
use
his

to
plumb
the
depths
he
knew
so
well
were
there
now
it
will
roll
under
its
own
power
no
one
man

now
epilogue
the
murder
of
senator
morgan
in
his
own
private
office
was
never
solved
if
it
had
occurred
before
the
election
suspicion
would
certainly
have
fallen
upon
roderick
kinnison
but
as
it
was
it
did
not
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
anyone
conceive
of
rod
the
rock
kicking
a
man
after
he
had
knocked
him
down
not
that
morgan
did
not
have
powerful
and
vindictive
enemies
in
the
underworld
he
had
so
many
that
it
proved
impossible
to
fasten
the
crime
to
any
one
of
them
officially
kinnison
was
on
a
leave
of
absence
from
the
galactic
patrol
the
office
of
port
admiral
had
been
detached
entirely
from
the
fleet
and
assigned
to
the
office
of
the
president
of
north
america
actually
however
in
every
respect
that
counted
roderick
kinnison
was
still
port
admiral
and
would
remain
so
until
he
died
or
until
the
council
retired
him
by
force
officially
kinnison
was
taking
a
short
vacation
from
the
job
in
which
he
had
been
so
outstandingly
successful
actually
he
was
doing
a
quick
flit
to
petrine
to
get
personally
acquainted
with
the
new
lensmen
and
to
see
what
kind
of
a
job
they
were
doing
besides
virgil
samms
was
already
there
he
arrived
he
got
acquainted
he
saw
he
approved
how
about
coming
back
to
tellus
with
me
virge
he
asked
when
the
visiting
was
done
i
got
to
make
a
speech
and
it
be
nice
to
have
you
hold
my
head
i
be
glad
to
and
the
took
off
half
of
north
america
was
dark
when
they
neared
tellus
all
of
it
apparently
was
obscured
by
clouds
only
the
navigating
officers
of
the
vessel
knew
where
they
were
nor
did
either
of
the
two
lensmen
care
they
were
having
too
much
fun
arguing
about
the
talents
and
abilities
of
their
respective
grandsons
the
landed
a
bug
was
waiting
the
two
lensmen
without
an
order
being
given
were
whisked
away
samms
had
not
asked
where
the
speech
was
to
be
given
and
kinnison
simply
did
not
realize
that
he
had
not
told
him
all
about
it
thus
samms
had
no
idea
that
he
was
just
leaving
spokane
spaceport
washington
after
a
few
miles
of
fast
driving
the
bug
reached
the
city
it
slowed
down
swung
into
maple
street
and
passed
a
sign
reading
cannon
hill
neither
of
which
names
meant
anything
to
either
lensman
kinnison
looked
at
his
friend
head
and
glanced
at
his
watch
looking
at
you
reminds
me
i
need
a
haircut
he
remarked
should
have
got
one
aboard
but
did
think
of
it
joy
told
me
if
i
come
home
without
it
she
braid
it
in
pigtails
and
tie
it
up
with
pink
ribbons
and
you
shaggier
than
i
am
you
got
to
get
one
or
else
buy
yourself
a
violin
what
say
we
do
it
now
have
we
got
time
enough
plenty
then
to
the
driver
stop
at
the
first
barber
shop
you
see
please
yes
sir
there
a
good
one
a
few
blocks
further
along
the
bug
sped
down
maple
street
turned
sharply
into
twelfth
avenue
neither
lensman
saw
the
sign
here
you
are
sir
thanks
there
were
two
barbers
and
two
chairs
both
empty
the
lensmen
noticing
that
the
place
was
neatly
kept
and
meticulously
clean
sat
down
and
resumed
their
discussion
of
two
extremely
unusual
infants
the
barbers
went
busily
to
work
just
as
well
though
better
really
that
the
kids
did
marry
each
other
at
that
kinnison
concluded
finally
the
way
it
is
we
each
got
a
grandson
it
be
tough
to
have
to
share
one
with
samms
made
no
reply
to
this
sally
for
something
was
happening
the
fact
that
this
barber
was
had
not
rung
any
bells
there
were
lots
of
barbers
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
the
cat
a
gray
kitten
which
after
standing
up
on
its
hind
legs
to
sniff
ecstatically
at
his
ankles
had
uttered
a
couple
of
almost
inaudible
meows
and
had
begun
to
purr
happily
crouching
tensing
its
strong
little
legs
it
leaped
almost
vertically
upward
its
tail
struck
the
barber
elbow
hastily
brushing
the
kitten
aside
and
beginning
profuse
apologies
both
for
his
awkwardness
and
for
the
presence
of
the
cat
he
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before
and
he
would
drown
him
forthwith
the
barber
applied
a
styptic
pencil
and
recollection
hit
samms
a
blow
well
i
a
he
voiced
three
highly
highly
specific
expletives
which
as
mentor
had
foretold
so
long
before
were
both
and
profane
then
as
full
realization
dawned
he
bit
a
word
squarely
in
two
excuse
me
please
carbonero
for
this
outrageous
display
it
was
not
the
scratch
nor
was
any
of
it
your
fault
nothing
you
could
have
done
would
have
you
know
my
name
the
astonished
barber
interrupted
yes
you
were
ah
recommended
to
me
by
a
a
friend
whatever
samms
could
say
would
make
things
worse
the
truth
wild
as
it
was
would
have
to
be
told
at
least
in
part
you
do
not
look
like
an
italian
but
perhaps
you
have
enough
of
that
racial
heritage
to
believe
in
prophecy
of
course
sir
there
have
always
been
prophets
prophets
good
this
event
was
foretold
in
detail
in
such
complete
detail
that
i
was
deeply
terribly
shocked
even
to
the
kitten
you
call
it
thomas
yes
sir
thomas
aquinas
it
is
actually
a
female
in
here
thomasina
the
kitten
had
been
climbing
enthusiastically
up
his
leg
now
as
he
held
a
pocket
invitingly
open
she
sprang
into
it
settled
down
and
began
to
purr
blissfully
while
the
barbers
and
kinnison
stared
samms
went
on
she
is
determined
to
adopt
me
and
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
requite
such
affection
would
you
part
with
her
for
say
ten
credits
credits
i
be
glad
to
give
her
to
you
for
nothing
ten
it
is
then
one
more
thing
rod
you
always
carry
a
pocket
rule
measure
this
scratch
will
you
you
find
it
mighty
close
to
three
millimeters
long
not
virge
it
three
millimeters
as
near
as
this
vernier
can
scale
it
and
just
above
and
parallel
to
the
check
just
above
and
as
parallel
as
though
it
had
been
ruled
there
by
a
draftsman
well
that
that
let
get
finished
with
the
haircuts
before
late
for
your
speech
and
the
barbers
with
thoughts
which
will
be
left
to
the
imagination
resumed
their
interrupted
tasks
spill
it
virge
kinnison
lensed
the
thought
if
carbonero
who
did
not
know
samms
at
all
had
been
amazed
at
what
had
been
happening
kinnison
who
had
known
him
so
long
and
so
well
had
been
literally
and
completely
dumbfounded
what
in
hell
behind
this
what
the
story
give
samms
told
him
and
a
mental
silence
fell
a
silence
too
deep
for
intelligible
thought
each
was
beginning
to
realize
that
he
never
would
and
never
could
know
what
mentor
of
arisia
really
was
the
secret
planet
no
human
had
ever
landed
on
the
hidden
planet
of
arisia
a
mysterious
space
barrier
turned
back
both
men
and
ships
then
the
word
came
to
earth
go
to
arisia
samms
of
the
galactic
patrol
went
and
came
back
with
the
lens
the
strange
device
that
gave
its
wearer
powers
no
man
had
ever
possessed
before
samms
knew
the
price
of
that
power
would
be
high
but
even
he
had
no
idea
of
the
ultimate
cost
and
the
weird
destiny
waiting
for
