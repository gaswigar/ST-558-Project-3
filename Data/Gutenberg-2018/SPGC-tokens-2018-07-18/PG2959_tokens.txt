supper
at
my
casino
with
and
de
bernis
the
french
ambassador
a
proposal
from
i
accept
it
consequences
is
unfaithful
to
me
and
i
can
not
complain
i
felt
highly
pleased
with
the
i
had
arranged
with
m
m
and
i
ought
to
have
been
happy
yet
i
was
not
so
but
whence
came
the
anxiety
which
was
a
torment
to
me
whence
from
my
fatal
habit
of
gambling
that
passion
was
rooted
in
me
to
live
and
to
play
were
to
me
two
identical
things
and
as
i
could
not
hold
the
bank
i
would
go
and
punt
at
the
ridotto
where
i
lost
my
money
morning
and
night
that
state
of
things
made
me
miserable
perhaps
someone
will
say
to
me
why
did
you
play
when
there
was
no
need
of
it
when
you
were
in
want
of
nothing
when
you
had
all
the
money
you
could
wish
to
satisfy
your
fancies
that
would
be
a
troublesome
question
if
i
had
not
made
it
a
law
to
tell
the
truth
well
then
dear
inquisitive
reader
if
i
played
with
almost
the
certainty
of
losing
although
no
one
perhaps
was
more
sensible
than
i
was
to
the
losses
made
in
gambling
it
is
because
i
had
in
me
the
evil
spirit
of
avarice
it
is
because
i
loved
prodigality
and
because
my
heart
bled
when
i
found
myself
compelled
to
spend
any
money
that
i
had
not
won
at
the
it
is
an
ugly
vice
dear
reader
i
do
not
deny
it
however
all
i
can
say
is
that
during
the
four
days
previous
to
the
supper
i
lost
all
the
gold
won
for
me
by
m
m
on
the
day
i
went
to
my
casino
where
at
the
appointed
hour
m
m
came
with
her
friend
whom
she
introduced
to
me
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
off
his
mask
i
had
an
ardent
wish
sir
said
de
bernis
to
me
to
renew
acquaintance
with
you
since
i
heard
from
madame
that
we
had
known
each
other
in
paris
with
these
words
he
looked
at
me
attentively
as
people
will
do
when
they
are
trying
to
recollect
a
person
whom
they
have
lost
sight
of
i
then
told
him
that
we
had
never
spoken
to
one
another
and
that
he
had
not
seen
enough
of
me
to
recollect
my
features
now
i
had
the
honour
i
added
to
dine
with
your
excellency
at
de
mocenigo
house
but
you
talked
all
the
time
with
marshal
keith
the
prussian
ambassador
and
i
was
not
fortunate
enough
to
attract
your
attention
as
you
were
on
the
point
of
leaving
paris
to
return
to
venice
you
went
away
almost
immediately
after
dinner
and
i
have
never
had
the
honour
of
seeing
you
since
that
time
now
i
recollect
you
he
answered
and
i
remember
asking
whether
you
were
not
the
secretary
of
the
embassy
but
from
this
day
we
shall
not
forget
each
other
again
for
the
mysteries
which
unite
us
are
of
a
nature
likely
to
establish
a
lasting
intimacy
between
us
the
amiable
couple
were
not
long
before
they
felt
thoroughly
at
ease
and
we
sat
down
to
supper
of
which
of
course
i
did
the
honours
the
ambassador
a
fine
connoisseur
in
wines
found
mine
excellent
and
was
delighted
to
hear
that
i
had
them
from
count
algarotti
who
was
reputed
as
having
the
best
cellar
in
venice
my
supper
was
delicate
and
abundant
and
my
manners
towards
my
handsome
guests
were
those
of
a
private
individual
receiving
his
sovereign
and
his
mistress
i
saw
that
m
m
was
charmed
with
the
respect
with
which
i
treated
her
and
with
my
conversation
which
evidently
interested
the
ambassador
highly
the
serious
character
of
a
first
meeting
did
not
prevent
the
utterance
of
witty
jests
for
in
that
respect
de
bernis
was
a
true
frenchman
i
have
travelled
much
i
have
deeply
studied
men
individually
and
in
a
body
but
i
have
never
met
with
true
sociability
except
in
frenchmen
they
alone
know
how
to
jest
and
it
is
rare
delicate
refined
jesting
which
animates
conversation
and
makes
society
charming
during
our
delightful
supper
wit
was
never
wanting
and
the
amiable
m
m
led
the
conversation
to
the
romantic
combination
which
had
given
her
occasion
to
know
me
naturally
she
proceeded
to
speak
of
my
passion
for
c
c
and
she
gave
such
an
interesting
description
of
that
young
girl
that
the
ambassador
listened
with
as
much
attention
as
if
he
had
never
seen
the
object
of
it
but
that
was
his
part
for
he
was
not
aware
that
i
had
been
informed
of
his
having
witnessed
from
his
my
silly
interview
with
c
c
he
told
m
m
that
he
would
have
been
delighted
if
she
had
brought
her
young
friend
to
sup
with
us
that
would
be
running
too
great
a
risk
answered
the
cunning
nun
but
if
you
approve
of
it
she
added
looking
at
me
i
can
make
you
sup
with
her
at
my
casino
for
we
sleep
in
the
same
room
that
offer
surprised
me
much
but
it
was
not
the
moment
to
shew
it
so
i
replied
it
is
impossible
madam
to
add
anything
to
the
pleasure
of
your
society
yet
i
confess
i
should
be
pleased
if
you
could
contrive
to
do
us
that
great
favour
well
i
will
think
of
it
but
observed
the
ambassador
if
i
am
to
be
one
of
the
party
i
think
it
would
be
right
to
apprize
the
young
lady
of
it
it
is
not
necessary
for
i
will
write
to
her
to
agree
to
whatever
madam
may
propose
to
her
i
will
do
so
i
begged
the
ambassador
to
prepare
himself
with
a
good
stock
of
indulgence
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
who
had
no
experience
of
the
world
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
related
the
history
of
which
greatly
amused
him
he
entreated
me
to
let
him
see
her
portrait
he
informed
me
that
she
was
still
an
inmate
of
the
where
she
continued
to
be
the
delight
of
louis
to
whom
she
had
given
a
child
my
guests
left
me
after
midnight
highly
pleased
and
i
remained
alone
the
next
morning
faithful
to
the
promise
i
had
made
to
my
beautiful
nun
i
wrote
to
c
c
without
informing
her
that
there
would
be
a
fourth
person
at
the
projected
supper
and
having
given
my
note
to
laura
i
repaired
to
muran
where
i
found
the
following
letter
from
m
m
i
could
not
sleep
soundly
my
love
if
i
did
not
ease
my
conscience
of
an
unpleasant
weight
perhaps
you
did
not
approve
of
the
with
our
young
friend
and
you
may
not
have
objected
out
of
mere
politeness
tell
me
the
truth
dearest
for
should
you
not
look
forward
to
that
meeting
with
pleasure
i
can
contrive
to
undo
it
without
implicating
you
in
any
way
trust
me
for
that
if
however
you
have
no
objection
to
the
party
it
will
take
place
as
agreed
believe
me
i
love
your
soul
more
than
your
heart
i
mean
than
your
person
adieu
her
fear
was
very
natural
but
out
of
shamefacedness
i
did
not
like
to
retract
m
m
knew
me
well
and
as
a
skilful
tactician
she
attacked
my
weak
side
here
is
my
answer
i
expected
your
letter
my
best
beloved
and
you
can
not
doubt
it
because
as
you
know
me
thoroughly
you
must
be
aware
that
i
know
you
as
well
yes
i
know
your
mind
and
i
know
what
idea
you
must
entertain
of
mine
because
i
have
exposed
to
you
all
my
weakness
and
irritability
by
my
sophisms
i
do
penance
for
it
dearest
when
i
think
that
having
raised
your
suspicions
your
tenderness
for
me
must
have
been
weakened
forget
my
visions
i
beg
and
be
quite
certain
that
for
the
future
my
soul
will
be
in
unison
with
yours
the
supper
must
take
place
it
will
be
a
pleasure
for
me
but
let
me
confess
that
in
accepting
it
i
have
shewn
myself
more
grateful
than
polite
c
c
is
a
novice
and
i
am
not
sorry
to
give
her
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
world
in
what
school
could
she
learn
better
than
yours
therefore
i
recommend
her
to
you
and
you
will
please
me
much
by
continuing
to
shew
your
care
and
friendship
towards
her
and
by
increasing
if
possible
the
sum
of
your
goodness
i
fear
that
you
may
entice
her
to
take
the
veil
and
if
she
did
i
would
never
console
myself
your
friend
has
quite
captivated
me
he
is
a
superior
man
and
truly
charming
thus
did
i
wittingly
deprive
myself
of
the
power
of
drawing
back
but
i
was
able
to
realize
the
full
force
of
the
situation
i
had
no
difficulty
in
guessing
that
the
ambassador
was
in
love
with
c
c
and
that
he
had
confessed
as
much
to
m
m
who
not
being
in
a
position
to
object
to
it
was
compelled
to
shew
herself
compliant
and
to
assist
him
in
everything
that
could
render
his
passion
successful
she
could
certainly
not
do
anything
without
my
consent
and
she
had
evidently
considered
the
affair
too
delicate
to
venture
upon
proposing
the
party
to
me
they
had
no
doubt
put
their
heads
together
so
that
by
bringing
the
conversation
on
that
subject
i
should
find
myself
compelled
for
the
sake
of
politeness
and
perhaps
of
my
inward
feelings
to
fall
into
the
snare
the
ambassador
whose
profession
it
was
to
carry
on
intrigues
skilfully
had
succeeded
well
and
i
had
taken
the
bait
as
he
wished
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
not
only
so
as
not
to
shew
myself
a
very
silly
being
but
also
in
order
not
to
prove
myself
shamefully
ungrateful
towards
a
man
who
had
granted
me
privileges
nevertheless
the
consequence
of
it
all
was
likely
to
be
some
coolness
in
my
feelings
towards
both
my
mistresses
m
m
had
become
conscious
of
this
after
she
had
returned
to
the
convent
and
wishing
to
screen
herself
from
all
responsibility
she
had
lost
no
time
in
writing
to
me
that
she
would
cause
the
projected
supper
to
be
abandoned
in
case
i
should
disapprove
of
it
but
she
knew
very
well
that
i
would
not
accept
her
offer
is
a
stronger
passion
even
than
jealousy
it
does
not
allow
a
man
who
has
some
pretension
to
wit
to
shew
himself
jealous
particularly
towards
a
person
who
is
not
tainted
by
that
base
passion
and
has
proved
it
the
next
day
having
gone
early
to
the
casino
i
found
the
ambassador
already
there
and
he
welcomed
me
in
the
most
friendly
manner
he
told
me
that
if
he
had
known
me
in
paris
he
would
have
introduced
me
at
the
court
where
i
should
certainly
have
made
my
fortune
now
when
i
think
of
that
i
say
to
myself
that
might
have
been
the
case
but
of
what
good
would
it
have
been
to
me
perhaps
i
should
have
fallen
a
victim
of
the
revolution
like
so
many
others
de
bernis
himself
would
have
been
one
of
those
victims
if
fate
had
not
allowed
him
to
die
in
rome
in
he
died
there
unhappy
although
wealthy
unless
his
feelings
had
undergone
a
complete
change
before
his
death
and
i
do
not
believe
it
i
asked
him
whether
he
liked
venice
and
he
answered
that
he
could
not
do
otherwise
than
like
that
city
in
which
he
enjoyed
excellent
health
and
in
which
with
plenty
of
money
life
could
be
enjoyed
better
than
anywhere
else
but
i
do
not
expect
he
added
to
be
allowed
to
keep
this
embassy
very
long
be
kind
enough
to
let
that
remain
between
us
i
do
not
wish
to
make
m
m
unhappy
we
were
conversing
in
all
confidence
when
m
m
arrived
with
her
young
friend
who
showed
her
surprise
at
seeing
another
man
with
me
but
i
encouraged
her
by
the
most
tender
welcome
and
she
recovered
all
her
composure
when
she
saw
the
delight
of
the
stranger
at
being
answered
by
her
in
good
french
it
gave
us
both
an
opportunity
of
paying
the
warmest
compliments
to
the
mistress
who
had
taught
her
so
well
c
c
was
truly
charming
her
looks
bright
and
modest
at
the
same
time
seemed
to
say
to
me
you
must
belong
to
me
i
wished
to
see
her
shine
before
our
friends
and
i
contrived
to
conquer
a
cowardly
feeling
of
jealousy
which
in
spite
of
myself
was
beginning
to
get
hold
of
me
i
took
care
to
make
her
talk
on
such
subjects
as
i
knew
to
be
familiar
to
her
i
developed
her
natural
intelligence
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
admired
applauded
flattered
animated
by
the
satisfaction
she
could
read
in
my
eyes
c
c
appeared
a
prodigy
to
de
bernis
and
oh
what
a
contradiction
of
the
human
heart
i
was
pleased
yet
i
trembled
lest
he
should
fall
in
love
with
her
what
an
enigma
i
was
intent
myself
upon
a
work
which
would
have
caused
me
to
murder
any
man
who
dared
to
undertake
it
during
the
supper
which
was
worthy
of
a
king
the
ambassador
treated
c
c
with
the
most
delicate
attentions
wit
cheerfulness
decent
manners
attended
our
delightful
party
and
did
not
expel
the
gaiety
and
the
merry
jests
with
which
a
frenchman
knows
how
to
season
every
conversation
an
observing
critic
who
without
being
acquainted
with
us
wished
to
guess
whether
love
was
present
at
our
happy
party
might
have
suspected
perhaps
but
he
certainly
could
not
have
affirmed
that
it
was
there
m
m
treated
the
ambassador
as
a
friend
she
shewed
no
other
feeling
towards
me
than
that
of
deep
esteem
and
she
behaved
to
c
c
with
the
tender
affection
of
a
sister
de
bernis
was
kind
polite
and
amiable
with
m
m
but
he
never
ceased
to
take
the
greatest
interest
in
every
word
uttered
by
c
c
who
played
her
part
to
perfection
because
she
had
only
to
follow
her
own
nature
and
that
nature
being
beautiful
c
c
could
not
fail
to
be
most
charming
we
had
passed
five
delightful
hours
and
the
ambassador
seemed
more
pleased
even
than
any
of
us
m
m
had
the
air
of
a
person
satisfied
with
her
own
work
and
i
was
playing
the
part
of
an
approving
spectator
c
c
looked
highly
pleased
at
having
secured
the
general
approbation
and
there
was
perhaps
a
slight
feeling
of
vanity
in
her
arising
from
the
special
attention
which
the
ambassador
had
bestowed
on
her
she
looked
at
me
smiling
and
i
could
easily
understand
the
language
of
her
soul
by
which
she
wished
to
tell
me
that
she
felt
perfectly
well
the
difference
between
the
society
in
which
she
was
then
and
that
in
which
her
brother
had
given
us
such
a
disgusting
specimen
of
his
depravity
after
midnight
it
was
time
to
think
of
our
departure
and
de
bernis
undertook
all
the
complimentary
part
thanking
m
m
for
the
most
agreeable
supper
he
had
ever
made
in
his
life
he
contrived
to
make
her
offer
a
repetition
of
it
for
two
days
afterwards
and
he
asked
me
for
the
sake
of
appearance
whether
i
should
not
find
as
much
delight
in
that
second
meeting
as
himself
could
he
have
any
doubt
of
my
answering
affirmatively
i
believe
not
for
i
had
placed
myself
under
the
necessity
of
being
compliant
all
being
agreed
we
parted
company
the
next
day
when
i
thought
of
that
exemplary
supper
i
had
no
difficulty
in
guessing
what
the
ultimate
result
would
be
the
ambassador
owed
his
great
fortune
entirely
to
the
fair
sex
because
he
possessed
to
the
highest
degree
the
art
of
coddling
love
and
as
his
nature
was
eminently
voluptuous
he
found
his
advantage
in
it
because
he
knew
how
to
call
desires
into
existence
and
this
procured
him
enjoyments
worthy
of
his
delicate
taste
i
saw
that
he
was
deeply
in
love
with
c
c
and
i
was
far
from
supposing
him
the
man
to
be
satisfied
with
looking
at
her
lovely
eyes
he
certainly
had
some
plan
arranged
and
m
m
in
spite
of
all
her
honesty
was
the
prime
manager
of
it
i
knew
that
she
would
carry
it
on
with
such
delicate
skill
that
i
should
not
see
any
evidence
of
it
although
i
did
not
feel
disposed
to
shew
more
compliance
than
was
strictly
just
i
foresaw
that
in
the
end
i
should
be
the
dupe
and
my
poor
c
c
the
victim
of
a
trick
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
either
to
consent
with
a
good
grace
or
to
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
and
believing
my
dear
little
wife
incapable
of
abandoning
herself
to
anything
likely
to
displease
me
i
allowed
myself
to
be
taken
off
my
guard
and
to
rely
upon
the
difficulty
of
seducing
her
stupid
calculation
and
shamefacedness
prevented
me
from
using
my
common
sense
at
all
events
that
intrigue
kept
me
in
a
state
of
fever
because
i
was
afraid
of
its
consequences
and
yet
curiosity
mastered
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
was
longing
for
the
result
i
knew
very
well
that
a
second
edition
of
the
supper
did
not
imply
that
the
same
play
would
be
performed
a
second
time
and
i
foresaw
that
the
changes
would
be
strongly
marked
but
i
thought
myself
bound
in
honour
not
to
retract
i
could
not
lead
the
intrigue
but
i
believed
myself
sufficiently
skilful
to
baffle
all
their
manoeuvrings
after
all
those
considerations
however
considerations
which
enabled
me
to
assume
the
countenance
of
false
bravery
the
inexperience
of
c
c
who
in
spite
of
all
the
knowledge
she
had
lately
acquired
was
only
a
novice
caused
me
great
anxiety
it
was
easy
to
abuse
her
natural
wish
to
be
polite
but
that
fear
gave
way
very
soon
before
the
confidence
i
had
in
m
m
s
delicacy
i
thought
that
having
seen
how
i
had
spent
six
hours
with
that
young
girl
knowing
for
a
certainty
that
i
intended
to
marry
her
m
m
would
never
be
guilty
of
such
base
treason
all
these
thoughts
worthy
only
of
a
weak
and
bashful
jealousy
brought
no
conclusive
decision
i
had
to
follow
the
current
and
watch
events
at
the
appointed
time
i
repaired
to
the
casino
where
i
found
my
two
lovely
friends
sitting
by
the
fire
good
evening
my
two
divinities
where
is
our
charming
frenchman
he
has
not
arrived
yet
answered
m
m
but
he
will
doubtless
soon
be
here
i
took
off
my
mask
and
sitting
between
them
i
gave
them
a
thousand
kisses
taking
good
care
not
to
shew
any
preference
and
although
i
knew
that
they
were
aware
of
the
unquestionable
right
i
had
upon
both
of
them
i
kept
within
the
limits
of
the
utmost
decency
i
congratulated
them
upon
the
mutual
inclination
they
felt
for
each
other
and
i
saw
that
they
were
pleased
not
to
have
to
blush
on
that
account
more
than
one
hour
was
spent
in
gallant
and
friendly
conversation
without
my
giving
any
satisfaction
to
my
burning
desires
m
attracted
me
more
than
c
c
but
i
would
not
for
the
world
have
offended
the
charming
girl
m
m
was
beginning
to
shew
some
anxiety
about
the
absence
of
de
bernis
when
the
brought
her
a
note
from
him
a
courier
he
wrote
who
arrived
two
hours
ago
prevents
my
being
happy
for
i
am
compelled
to
pass
it
in
answering
the
dispatches
i
have
received
i
trust
that
you
will
forgive
and
pity
me
may
i
hope
that
you
will
kindly
grant
me
on
friday
the
pleasure
of
which
i
am
so
unfortunately
deprived
let
me
know
your
answer
by
i
wish
ardently
in
that
case
to
find
you
with
the
same
guests
to
whom
i
beg
you
will
present
my
affectionate
compliments
well
said
m
m
it
is
not
his
fault
we
will
sup
without
him
will
you
come
on
friday
yes
with
the
greatest
pleasure
but
what
is
the
matter
with
you
dear
c
c
you
look
sad
sad
no
unless
it
should
be
for
the
sake
of
my
friend
for
i
have
never
seen
a
more
polite
and
more
obliging
gentleman
very
well
dear
i
am
glad
he
has
rendered
you
so
sensible
what
do
you
mean
could
anyone
be
insensible
to
his
merit
better
still
but
i
agree
with
you
only
tell
me
if
you
love
him
well
even
if
i
loved
him
do
you
think
i
would
go
and
tell
him
besides
i
am
certain
that
he
loves
my
friend
so
saying
she
sat
down
on
m
m
knee
calling
her
her
own
little
wife
and
my
two
beauties
began
to
bestow
on
one
another
caresses
which
made
me
laugh
heartily
far
from
troubling
their
sport
i
excited
them
in
order
to
enjoy
a
spectacle
with
which
i
had
long
been
acquainted
m
m
took
up
a
book
full
of
the
most
lascivious
engravings
and
said
with
a
significant
glance
in
my
direction
do
you
wish
me
to
have
a
fire
lighted
in
the
alcove
i
understood
her
and
replied
you
would
oblige
me
for
the
bed
being
large
we
can
all
three
sleep
comfortably
in
it
i
guessed
that
she
feared
my
suspecting
the
ambassador
of
enjoying
from
the
mysterious
closet
the
sight
of
our
amorous
trio
and
she
wished
to
destroy
that
suspicion
by
her
proposal
the
table
having
been
laid
in
front
of
the
alcove
supper
was
served
and
we
all
did
honour
to
it
we
were
all
blessed
with
a
devouring
appetite
while
m
m
was
teaching
her
friend
how
to
mix
punch
i
was
admiring
with
delight
the
progress
made
in
beauty
by
c
c
your
bosom
i
said
to
her
must
have
become
perfect
during
the
last
nine
months
it
is
like
mine
answered
m
m
would
you
like
to
see
for
yourself
of
course
i
did
not
refuse
m
m
unlaced
her
friend
who
made
no
resistance
and
performing
afterwards
the
same
office
upon
herself
in
less
than
two
minutes
i
was
admiring
four
rivals
contending
for
the
golden
apple
like
the
three
goddesses
and
which
would
have
set
at
defiance
the
handsome
paris
himself
to
adjudge
the
prize
without
injustice
need
i
say
what
an
ardent
fire
that
ravishing
sight
sent
coursing
through
my
veins
i
placed
immediately
an
the
table
the
academie
des
dames
and
pointed
out
a
certain
position
to
m
m
who
understanding
my
wishes
said
to
c
c
will
you
darling
represent
that
group
with
me
a
look
of
compliance
was
c
c
only
answer
she
was
not
yet
inured
to
amorous
pleasures
as
much
as
her
lovely
teacher
while
i
was
laughing
with
delight
the
two
friends
were
getting
ready
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
all
three
in
bed
and
in
a
state
of
nature
at
first
satisfied
with
enjoying
the
sight
of
the
barren
contest
of
my
two
bacchanalians
i
was
amused
by
their
efforts
and
by
the
contrast
of
colours
for
one
was
dark
and
the
other
fair
but
soon
excited
myself
and
consumed
by
all
the
fire
of
voluptuousness
i
threw
myself
upon
them
and
i
made
them
one
after
the
other
almost
faint
away
from
the
excess
of
love
and
enjoyment
worn
out
and
satiated
with
pleasure
i
invited
them
to
take
some
rest
we
slept
until
we
were
awakened
by
the
alarum
which
i
had
taken
care
to
set
at
four
we
were
certain
of
turning
to
good
account
the
two
hours
we
had
then
to
spare
before
parting
company
which
we
did
at
the
dawn
of
day
humiliated
at
having
to
confess
our
exhaustion
but
highly
pleased
with
each
other
and
longing
for
a
renewal
of
our
delightful
pleasures
the
next
day
however
when
i
came
to
think
of
that
rather
too
lively
night
during
which
as
is
generally
the
case
love
had
routed
reason
i
felt
some
remorse
m
m
wanted
to
convince
me
of
her
love
and
for
that
purpose
she
had
combined
all
the
virtues
which
i
attached
to
my
own
affection
namely
honour
delicacy
and
truth
but
her
temperament
of
which
her
mind
was
the
slave
carried
her
towards
excess
and
she
prepared
everything
in
order
to
give
way
to
it
while
she
awaited
the
opportunity
of
making
me
her
accomplice
she
was
coaxing
love
to
make
it
compliant
and
to
succeed
in
mastering
it
because
her
heart
enslaved
by
her
senses
never
reproached
her
she
likewise
tried
to
deceive
herself
by
endeavouring
to
forget
that
i
might
complain
of
having
been
surprised
she
knew
that
to
utter
such
a
complaint
i
would
have
to
acknowledge
myself
weaker
or
less
courageous
than
she
was
and
she
relied
upon
my
being
ashamed
to
make
such
a
confession
i
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
absence
of
the
ambassador
had
been
arranged
and
concerted
beforehand
i
could
see
still
further
for
it
seemed
evident
to
me
that
the
two
conspirators
had
foreseen
that
i
would
guess
the
artifice
and
that
feeling
stung
to
the
quick
in
spite
of
all
my
regrets
i
would
not
shew
myself
less
generous
than
they
had
been
themselves
the
ambassador
having
first
procured
me
a
delightful
night
how
could
i
refuse
to
let
him
enjoy
as
pleasant
a
one
my
friends
had
argued
very
well
for
in
spite
of
all
the
objections
of
my
mind
i
saw
that
i
could
not
on
my
side
put
any
obstacle
in
their
way
c
c
was
no
impediment
to
them
they
were
certain
of
conquering
her
the
moment
she
was
not
hindered
by
my
presence
it
rested
entirely
with
m
m
who
had
perfect
control
over
her
poor
girl
i
saw
her
on
the
high
road
to
debauchery
and
it
was
my
own
doing
i
sighed
when
i
thought
how
little
i
had
spared
them
in
our
last
orgie
and
what
would
become
of
me
if
both
of
them
should
happen
to
be
by
my
doing
in
such
a
position
as
to
be
compelled
to
run
away
from
the
convent
i
could
imagine
both
of
them
thrown
upon
my
hands
and
the
prospect
was
not
particularly
agreeable
it
would
be
an
de
richesse
in
this
miserable
contest
between
reason
and
prejudice
between
nature
and
sentiment
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
either
to
go
to
the
supper
or
to
remain
absent
from
it
if
i
go
said
i
to
myself
that
night
will
pass
with
perfect
decency
but
i
shall
prove
myself
very
ridiculous
jealous
ungrateful
and
even
wanting
in
common
politeness
if
i
remain
absent
c
c
is
lost
at
least
in
my
estimation
for
i
feel
that
my
love
will
no
longer
exist
and
then
to
all
idea
of
a
marriage
with
her
in
the
perplexity
of
mind
in
which
i
found
myself
i
felt
a
want
of
something
more
certain
than
mere
probabilities
to
base
my
decision
upon
i
put
on
my
mask
and
repaired
to
the
mansion
of
the
french
ambassador
i
addressed
myself
to
the
saying
that
i
had
a
letter
for
versailles
and
that
i
would
thank
him
to
deliver
it
to
the
courier
when
he
went
back
to
france
with
his
excellency
dispatches
but
sir
answered
the
man
we
have
not
had
a
special
courier
for
the
last
two
months
what
did
not
a
special
cabinet
messenger
arrive
here
last
night
then
he
must
have
come
in
through
the
garret
window
or
down
the
chimney
for
on
the
word
of
an
honest
man
none
entered
through
the
gate
but
the
ambassador
worked
all
night
that
may
be
sir
but
not
here
for
his
excellency
dined
with
the
spanish
ambassador
and
did
not
return
till
very
late
i
had
guessed
rightly
i
could
no
longer
entertain
any
doubt
it
was
all
over
i
could
not
draw
back
without
shame
c
c
must
resist
if
the
game
was
distasteful
to
her
no
violence
would
of
course
be
offered
to
her
the
die
was
cast
towards
evening
i
went
to
the
casino
of
muran
and
wrote
a
short
note
to
m
m
requesting
her
to
excuse
me
if
some
important
business
of
de
bragadin
prevented
me
from
spending
the
night
with
her
and
with
our
two
friends
to
whom
i
sent
my
compliments
as
well
as
my
apologies
after
that
i
returned
to
venice
but
in
rather
an
unpleasant
mood
to
divert
myself
i
went
to
the
gaming
table
and
lost
all
night
two
days
afterwards
being
certain
that
a
letter
from
m
m
awaited
me
at
muran
i
went
over
and
the
handed
me
a
parcel
in
which
i
found
a
note
from
my
nun
and
a
letter
from
c
c
for
everything
was
now
in
common
between
them
here
is
c
c
letter
we
were
very
sorry
dearest
friend
when
we
heard
that
we
should
not
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
my
dear
m
m
friend
came
shortly
afterwards
and
when
he
read
your
note
he
likewise
expressed
his
deep
regret
we
expected
to
have
a
very
dull
supper
but
the
witty
sayings
of
that
gentleman
enlivened
us
and
you
can
not
imagine
of
what
follies
we
were
guilty
after
partaking
of
some
champagne
punch
our
friend
had
become
as
gay
as
ourselves
and
we
spent
the
night
in
trios
not
very
fatiguing
but
very
pleasant
i
can
assure
you
that
that
man
deserves
to
be
loved
but
he
must
acknowledge
himself
inferior
to
you
in
everything
believe
me
dearest
i
shall
ever
love
you
and
you
must
for
ever
remain
the
master
of
my
heart
in
spite
of
all
my
vexation
that
letter
made
me
laugh
but
the
note
of
m
m
was
much
more
singular
here
are
the
contents
of
it
i
am
certain
my
own
beloved
that
you
told
a
story
out
of
pure
politeness
but
you
had
guessed
that
i
expected
you
to
do
so
you
have
made
our
friend
a
splendid
present
in
exchange
for
the
one
he
made
you
when
he
did
not
object
to
his
m
m
bestowing
her
heart
upon
you
you
possess
that
heart
entirely
dearest
and
you
would
possess
it
under
all
circumstances
but
how
sweet
it
is
to
flavour
the
pleasures
of
love
with
the
charms
of
friendship
i
was
sorry
not
to
see
you
but
i
knew
that
if
you
had
come
we
would
not
have
had
much
enjoyment
for
our
friend
notwithstanding
all
his
wit
is
not
exempt
from
some
natural
prejudices
as
for
c
c
her
mind
is
now
quite
as
free
of
them
as
our
own
and
i
am
glad
she
owes
it
to
me
you
must
feel
thankful
to
me
for
having
completed
her
education
and
for
rendering
her
in
every
way
worthy
of
you
i
wish
you
had
been
hiding
in
the
closet
where
i
am
certain
you
would
have
spent
some
delightful
hours
on
wednesday
next
i
shall
be
yours
and
all
alone
with
you
in
your
casino
in
venice
let
me
know
whether
you
will
be
at
the
usual
hour
near
the
statue
of
the
hero
colleoni
in
case
you
should
be
prevented
name
any
other
day
i
had
to
answer
those
two
letters
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
they
had
been
written
and
in
spite
of
all
the
bitter
feelings
which
were
then
raging
in
my
heart
my
answers
were
to
be
as
sweet
as
honey
i
was
in
need
of
great
courage
but
i
said
to
myself
george
dandin
tu
las
voulu
i
could
not
refuse
to
pay
the
penalty
of
my
own
deeds
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
whether
the
shame
i
felt
was
what
is
called
shamefacedness
it
is
a
problem
which
i
leave
to
others
in
my
letter
to
c
c
i
had
the
courage
or
the
effrontery
to
congratulate
her
and
to
encourage
her
to
imitate
m
m
the
best
model
i
said
i
could
propose
to
her
i
wrote
to
my
nun
that
i
would
be
punctual
at
the
appointment
near
the
statue
and
amidst
many
false
compliments
which
ought
to
have
betrayed
the
true
state
of
my
heart
i
told
her
that
i
admired
the
perfect
education
she
had
given
to
c
c
but
that
i
congratulated
myself
upon
having
escaped
the
torture
i
should
have
suffered
in
the
mysterious
observatory
for
i
felt
that
i
could
not
have
borne
it
on
the
wednesday
i
was
punctual
at
the
rendezvous
and
i
had
not
to
wait
long
for
m
m
who
came
disguised
in
male
attire
no
theatre
she
said
to
me
let
us
go
to
the
to
lose
or
double
our
money
she
had
six
hundred
sequins
i
had
about
one
hundred
fortune
turned
her
back
upon
us
and
we
lost
all
i
expected
that
we
would
then
leave
that
cutthroat
place
but
m
m
having
left
me
for
a
minute
came
back
with
three
hundred
sequins
which
had
been
given
to
her
by
her
friend
whom
she
knew
where
to
find
that
money
given
by
love
or
by
friendship
brought
her
luck
for
a
short
time
and
she
soon
won
back
all
we
had
lost
but
in
our
greediness
or
imprudence
we
continued
to
play
and
finally
we
lost
our
last
sequin
when
we
could
play
no
longer
m
m
said
to
me
now
that
we
need
not
fear
thieves
let
us
go
to
our
supper
that
woman
religious
and
a
a
libertine
and
gambler
was
wonderful
in
all
she
did
she
had
just
lost
five
hundred
pounds
and
she
was
as
completely
at
her
ease
as
if
she
had
won
a
very
large
sum
it
is
true
that
the
money
she
had
just
lost
had
not
cost
her
much
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
she
found
me
sad
and
although
i
tried
hard
not
to
appear
so
but
as
for
her
always
the
same
she
was
handsome
brilliant
cheerful
and
amorous
she
thought
she
would
bring
back
my
spirits
by
giving
me
the
fullest
particulars
of
the
night
she
had
passed
with
c
c
and
her
friend
but
she
ought
to
have
guessed
that
she
was
going
the
wrong
way
that
is
a
very
common
error
it
comes
from
the
mind
because
people
imagine
that
what
they
feel
themselves
others
must
feel
likewise
i
was
on
thorns
and
i
tried
everything
to
avoid
that
subject
and
to
lead
the
conversation
into
a
different
channel
for
the
amorous
particulars
on
which
she
was
dwelling
with
apparent
delight
vexed
me
greatly
and
spite
causing
coldness
i
was
afraid
of
not
playing
my
part
very
warmly
in
the
amorous
contest
which
was
at
hand
when
a
lover
doubts
his
own
strength
he
may
almost
always
be
sure
that
he
will
fail
in
his
efforts
after
supper
we
went
to
bed
in
the
alcove
where
the
beauty
the
mental
and
physical
charms
the
grace
and
the
ardour
of
my
lovely
nun
cast
all
my
bad
temper
to
the
winds
and
soon
restored
me
to
my
usual
the
nights
being
shorter
we
spent
two
hours
in
the
most
delightful
pleasures
and
then
parted
satisfied
and
full
of
love
before
leaving
m
m
asked
me
to
go
to
her
casino
to
take
some
money
and
to
play
taking
her
for
my
partner
i
did
so
i
took
all
the
gold
i
found
and
playing
the
martingale
and
doubling
my
stakes
continuously
i
won
every
day
during
the
remainder
of
the
carnival
i
was
fortunate
enough
never
to
lose
the
sixth
card
and
if
i
had
lost
it
i
should
have
been
without
money
to
play
for
i
had
two
thousand
sequins
on
that
card
i
congratulated
myself
upon
having
increased
the
treasure
of
my
dear
mistress
who
wrote
to
me
that
for
the
sake
of
civility
we
ought
to
have
a
supper
partie
carree
on
shrove
monday
i
consented
that
supper
was
the
last
i
ever
had
in
my
life
with
c
c
she
was
in
excellent
spirits
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
and
as
i
paid
all
my
attentions
to
m
m
c
c
imitated
my
example
without
difficulty
and
she
devoted
herself
wholly
to
her
new
lover
foreseeing
that
we
would
a
little
later
be
all
of
us
in
each
way
i
begged
m
m
to
arrange
everything
so
that
we
could
be
apart
and
she
contrived
it
marvellously
well
after
supper
the
ambassador
proposed
a
game
of
faro
which
our
beauties
did
not
know
he
called
for
cards
and
placed
one
hundred
louis
on
the
table
before
him
he
dealt
and
took
care
to
make
c
c
win
the
whole
of
that
sum
it
was
the
best
way
to
make
her
accept
it
as
the
young
girl
dazzled
by
so
much
gold
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
asked
her
friend
to
take
care
of
it
for
her
until
such
time
as
she
should
leave
the
convent
to
get
married
when
the
game
was
over
m
m
complained
of
a
headache
and
said
that
she
would
go
to
bed
in
the
alcove
she
asked
me
to
come
and
lull
her
to
sleep
we
thus
left
the
new
lovers
free
to
be
as
gay
as
they
chose
six
hours
afterwards
when
the
alarum
warned
us
that
it
was
time
to
part
we
found
them
asleep
in
each
other
embrace
i
had
myself
passed
an
amorous
and
quiet
night
pleased
with
m
m
and
with
out
giving
one
thought
to
c
c
chapter
xxii
de
bernis
goes
away
leaving
me
the
use
of
his
casino
his
good
advice
how
i
follow
it
peril
of
and
myself
murray
the
english
ambassador
sale
of
the
casino
and
end
of
our
meetings
serious
illness
of
zorzi
and
condulmer
tonnie
though
the
infidelities
of
c
c
made
me
look
at
her
with
other
eyes
than
before
and
i
had
now
no
intention
of
making
her
the
companion
of
my
life
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
it
had
rested
with
me
to
stop
her
on
the
brink
of
the
stream
and
i
therefore
considered
it
my
duty
always
to
be
her
friend
if
i
had
been
more
logical
the
resolution
i
took
with
respect
to
her
would
doubtless
have
been
of
another
kind
i
should
have
said
to
myself
after
seducing
her
i
myself
have
set
the
example
of
infidelity
i
have
bidden
her
to
follow
blindly
the
advice
of
her
friend
although
i
knew
that
the
advice
and
the
example
of
m
would
end
in
her
ruin
i
had
insulted
in
the
most
grievous
manner
the
delicacy
of
my
mistress
and
that
before
her
very
eyes
and
after
all
this
how
could
i
ask
a
weak
woman
to
do
what
a
man
priding
himself
on
his
strength
would
shrink
from
at
tempting
i
should
have
stood
and
have
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
remain
the
same
to
her
but
flattering
myself
that
i
was
overcoming
mere
prejudices
i
was
in
fact
that
most
degraded
of
slaves
he
who
uses
his
strength
to
crush
the
weak
the
day
after
shrove
tuesday
going
to
the
casino
of
muran
i
found
there
a
letter
from
m
m
who
gave
me
two
pieces
of
bad
news
that
c
c
had
lost
her
mother
and
that
the
poor
girl
was
in
despair
and
that
the
whose
rheum
was
cured
had
returned
to
take
her
place
thus
c
c
was
deprived
of
her
friend
at
a
time
when
she
would
have
given
her
consolation
of
which
she
stood
in
great
need
c
c
it
seemed
had
gone
to
share
the
rooms
of
her
aunt
who
being
very
fond
of
her
had
obtained
permission
from
the
superior
this
circumstance
would
prevent
the
ambassador
taking
any
more
suppers
with
her
and
i
should
have
been
delighted
if
chance
had
put
this
obstacle
in
his
path
a
few
days
sooner
all
these
misfortunes
seemed
of
small
account
com
pared
with
what
i
was
afraid
of
for
c
c
might
have
to
pay
the
price
for
her
pleasures
and
i
so
far
regarded
myself
as
the
origin
of
her
unhappiness
as
to
feel
bound
never
to
abandon
her
and
this
might
have
involved
me
in
terrible
complications
m
m
asked
me
to
sup
with
her
and
her
lover
on
the
following
monday
i
went
and
found
them
both
sad
he
for
the
loss
of
his
new
mistress
and
she
because
she
had
no
longer
a
friend
to
make
the
seclusion
of
the
convent
pleasant
about
midnight
de
bemis
left
us
saying
in
a
melancholy
manner
that
he
feared
he
should
be
obliged
to
pass
several
months
in
vienna
on
important
diplomatic
business
before
parting
we
agreed
to
sup
together
every
friday
when
we
were
alone
m
m
told
me
that
the
ambassador
would
be
obliged
to
me
if
in
the
future
i
would
come
to
the
casino
two
hours
later
i
understood
that
the
and
witty
profligate
had
a
very
natural
prejudice
against
indulging
his
amorous
feelings
except
when
he
was
certain
of
being
alone
de
bemis
came
to
all
our
suppers
till
he
left
for
vienna
and
always
went
away
at
midnight
he
no
longer
made
use
of
his
partly
because
we
now
only
lay
in
the
recess
and
partly
because
having
had
time
to
make
love
before
my
arrival
his
desires
were
appeased
m
m
always
found
me
amorous
my
love
indeed
was
even
hotter
than
it
had
been
since
only
seeing
her
once
a
week
and
remaining
faithful
to
her
i
had
always
an
abundant
harvest
to
gather
in
c
c
letters
which
she
brought
to
me
softened
me
to
tears
for
she
said
that
after
the
loss
of
her
mother
she
could
not
count
upon
the
friendship
of
any
of
her
relations
she
called
me
her
sole
friend
her
only
protector
and
in
speaking
of
her
grief
in
not
being
able
to
see
me
any
more
whilst
she
remained
in
the
convent
she
begged
me
to
remain
faithful
to
her
dear
friend
on
good
friday
when
i
got
to
the
casino
i
found
the
lovers
with
grief
supper
was
served
but
the
ambassador
downcast
and
absent
neither
ate
nor
spoke
and
m
m
was
like
a
statue
that
moves
at
intervals
by
some
mechanism
good
sense
and
ordinary
politeness
prevented
me
from
asking
any
questions
but
on
m
m
leaving
us
together
de
bemis
told
me
that
she
was
distressed
and
with
reason
since
he
was
obliged
to
set
out
for
vienna
fifteen
days
after
easter
i
may
tell
you
confidentially
he
added
that
i
believe
i
shall
scarcely
be
able
to
return
but
she
must
not
be
told
as
she
would
be
in
despair
m
m
came
back
in
a
few
minutes
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
had
been
weeping
after
some
commonplace
conversation
de
bernis
seeing
m
m
still
said
do
not
grieve
thus
sweetheart
go
i
must
but
my
return
is
a
matter
of
equal
certainty
when
i
have
finished
the
important
business
which
summons
me
to
vienna
you
will
still
have
the
casino
but
dearest
both
friendship
and
prudence
make
me
advise
you
not
to
come
here
in
my
absence
for
after
i
have
left
venice
i
can
not
depend
upon
the
faith
of
the
gondoliers
in
my
service
and
i
suspect
our
friend
here
can
not
flatter
himself
on
his
ability
to
get
reliable
ones
i
may
also
tell
you
that
i
have
strong
reasons
for
suspecting
that
our
intercourse
is
known
to
the
state
inquisitors
who
conceal
their
knowledge
for
political
reasons
but
i
fancy
the
secret
would
soon
come
to
light
when
i
am
no
longer
here
and
when
the
nun
who
connives
at
your
departure
from
the
convent
knows
that
it
is
no
longer
for
me
that
you
leave
it
the
only
people
whom
i
would
trust
are
the
housekeeper
and
his
wife
i
shall
order
them
before
i
go
to
look
upon
our
friend
here
as
myself
and
you
can
make
your
arrangements
with
them
i
trust
all
will
go
well
till
my
return
if
you
will
only
behave
discreetly
i
will
write
to
you
under
cover
of
the
housekeeper
his
wife
will
give
you
my
letters
as
before
and
in
the
same
way
you
may
reply
i
must
needs
go
dearest
one
but
my
heart
is
with
you
and
i
leave
you
till
my
return
in
the
hands
of
a
friend
whom
i
rejoice
to
have
known
he
loves
you
he
has
a
heart
and
knowledge
of
the
world
and
he
will
not
let
you
make
any
mistakes
m
m
was
so
affected
by
what
the
ambassador
had
said
that
she
entreated
us
to
let
her
go
as
she
wished
to
be
alone
and
to
lie
down
as
she
went
we
agreed
to
sup
together
on
the
following
thursday
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
the
ambassador
impressed
me
with
the
absolute
necessity
of
concealing
from
her
that
he
was
going
to
return
no
more
i
am
going
said
he
to
work
in
concert
with
the
austrian
cabinet
on
a
treaty
which
will
be
the
talk
of
europe
i
entreat
you
to
write
to
me
unreservedly
and
as
a
friend
and
if
you
love
our
common
mistress
have
a
care
for
her
honour
and
above
all
have
the
strength
of
mind
to
resist
all
projects
which
are
certain
to
involve
you
in
misfortune
and
which
will
be
equally
fatal
to
both
you
know
what
happened
to
madame
de
riva
a
nun
in
the
convent
of
she
had
to
disappear
after
it
became
known
that
she
was
with
child
and
de
frulai
my
predecessor
went
mad
and
died
shortly
after
rousseau
told
me
that
he
died
of
poison
but
he
is
a
visionary
who
sees
the
black
side
of
everything
for
my
part
i
believe
that
he
died
of
grief
at
not
being
able
to
do
anything
for
the
unfortunate
woman
who
afterwards
procured
a
dispensation
from
her
vows
from
the
pope
and
having
got
married
is
now
living
at
padua
without
any
position
in
society
let
the
prudent
and
loyal
friend
master
the
lover
go
and
see
m
m
sometimes
in
the
parlour
of
the
convent
but
not
here
or
the
boatmen
will
betray
you
the
knowledge
which
we
both
have
that
the
girls
are
in
a
satisfactory
condition
is
a
great
alleviation
to
my
distress
but
you
must
confess
that
you
have
been
very
imprudent
you
have
risked
a
terrible
misfortune
consider
the
position
you
would
have
been
in
for
i
am
sure
you
would
not
have
abandoned
her
she
had
an
idea
that
the
danger
might
be
overcome
by
means
of
drugs
but
i
convinced
her
that
she
was
mistaken
in
god
name
be
discreet
in
the
future
and
write
to
me
fully
for
i
shall
always
be
interested
in
her
fate
both
from
duty
and
sentiment
we
returned
together
to
venice
where
we
separated
and
i
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
great
distress
in
the
morning
i
wrote
to
the
fair
afflicted
and
whilst
endeavouring
to
console
her
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
tried
to
impress
on
her
the
necessity
for
prudence
and
the
avoidance
of
such
escapades
as
might
eventually
ruin
us
next
day
i
received
her
reply
every
word
of
which
spelt
despair
nature
had
given
her
a
disposition
which
had
become
so
intensified
by
indulgence
that
the
cloister
was
unbearable
to
her
and
i
foresaw
the
hard
fights
i
should
have
to
undergo
we
saw
each
other
the
thursday
after
easter
and
i
told
her
that
i
should
not
come
to
the
casino
before
midnight
she
had
had
four
hours
to
pass
with
her
lover
in
tears
and
regrets
amongst
which
she
had
often
cursed
her
cruel
fate
and
the
foolish
resolution
which
made
her
take
the
veil
we
supped
together
and
although
the
meal
was
a
rich
and
delicate
one
we
did
it
little
honour
when
we
had
finished
the
ambassador
left
entreating
me
to
remain
which
i
did
without
thinking
at
all
of
the
pleasures
of
a
party
of
two
for
love
lighteth
not
his
torch
at
the
hearts
of
two
lovers
who
are
full
of
grief
and
sorrow
m
m
had
grown
thin
and
her
condition
excited
my
pity
and
shut
out
all
other
feelings
i
held
her
a
long
time
in
my
arms
covering
her
with
tender
and
affectionate
kisses
but
i
shewed
no
intention
of
consoling
her
by
amusements
in
which
her
spirit
could
not
have
taken
part
she
said
before
we
parted
that
i
had
shewn
myself
a
true
lover
and
she
asked
me
to
consider
myself
from
henceforth
as
her
only
friend
and
protector
next
week
when
we
were
together
as
usual
de
bemis
called
the
housekeeper
just
before
supper
and
in
his
presence
executed
a
deed
in
my
behalf
which
he
made
him
sign
in
this
document
he
transferred
to
me
all
rights
over
the
contents
of
the
casino
and
charged
him
to
consider
me
in
all
things
as
his
master
we
arranged
to
sup
together
two
days
after
to
make
our
farewells
but
on
my
arrival
i
found
by
herself
standing
up
and
pale
as
death
or
rather
as
white
as
a
statue
of
carrara
marble
he
is
gone
she
said
and
he
leaves
me
to
your
care
fatal
being
whom
perchance
i
shall
see
no
more
whom
i
thought
i
loved
but
as
a
friend
now
you
are
lost
to
me
i
see
my
mistake
before
i
knew
him
i
was
not
happy
but
neither
was
i
unhappy
as
i
now
am
i
passed
the
whole
night
beside
her
striving
by
the
most
delicate
attentions
to
soften
her
grief
but
with
out
success
her
character
as
abandoned
to
sorrow
as
to
pleasure
was
displayed
to
me
during
that
long
and
weary
night
she
told
me
at
what
hour
i
should
come
to
the
convent
parlour
the
next
day
and
on
my
arrival
i
was
delighted
to
find
her
not
quite
so
sad
she
shewed
me
a
letter
which
her
lover
had
written
to
her
from
trevisa
and
she
then
told
me
that
i
must
come
and
see
her
twice
a
week
warning
me
that
she
would
be
accompanied
sometimes
by
one
nun
and
sometimes
by
another
for
she
foresaw
that
my
visits
would
become
the
talk
of
the
convent
when
it
became
known
that
i
was
the
individual
who
used
to
go
to
mass
at
their
church
she
therefore
told
me
to
give
in
another
name
to
prevent
c
c
aunt
from
becoming
suspicious
nevertheless
she
added
this
will
not
prevent
my
coming
alone
when
i
have
any
matter
of
importance
to
communicate
to
you
promise
me
sweetheart
to
sup
and
sleep
at
the
casino
at
least
once
a
week
and
write
me
a
note
each
time
by
the
housekeeper
wife
i
made
no
difficulty
in
promising
her
that
much
we
thus
passed
a
fortnight
quietly
enough
as
she
was
happy
again
and
her
amorous
inclinations
had
returned
in
full
force
about
this
time
she
gave
me
a
piece
of
news
which
delighted
me
namely
that
c
c
had
no
longer
anything
to
fear
full
of
amorous
wishes
and
having
to
be
content
with
the
teasing
pleasure
of
seeing
one
another
through
a
wretched
grating
we
racked
our
brains
to
find
out
some
way
to
be
alone
together
to
do
what
we
liked
without
any
risk
i
am
assured
she
said
of
the
good
faith
of
the
gardener
sister
i
can
go
out
and
come
in
without
fear
of
being
seen
for
the
little
door
leading
to
the
convent
is
not
overlooked
by
any
window
indeed
it
is
thought
to
be
walled
up
nobody
can
see
me
crossing
the
garden
to
the
little
stream
which
is
considered
unnavigable
all
we
want
is
a
gondola
and
i
can
not
believe
that
with
the
help
of
money
you
will
be
unable
to
find
a
boatman
on
whom
we
may
rely
i
understood
from
these
expressions
that
she
suspected
me
of
becoming
cold
towards
her
and
this
suspicion
pierced
me
to
the
heart
listen
said
i
i
will
be
the
boatman
myself
i
will
come
to
the
quay
pass
by
the
little
door
and
you
shall
lead
me
to
your
room
where
i
will
pass
the
whole
night
with
you
and
the
day
too
if
you
think
you
can
hide
me
that
plan
said
she
makes
me
shudder
i
tremble
at
the
danger
to
which
you
might
be
exposed
no
i
should
be
too
unfortunate
if
i
were
to
be
the
cause
of
your
misfortune
but
as
you
can
row
come
in
the
boat
let
me
know
the
time
as
closely
as
possible
the
trusty
woman
will
be
on
the
watch
and
i
will
not
keep
you
four
minutes
waiting
i
will
get
into
the
boat
we
will
go
to
our
beloved
casino
and
then
we
shall
be
happy
without
fearing
anything
i
will
think
it
over
the
way
i
took
to
satisfy
her
was
as
follows
i
bought
a
small
boat
and
without
telling
her
i
went
one
night
all
by
myself
round
the
island
to
inspect
the
walls
of
the
convent
on
the
side
of
the
lagune
with
some
difficulty
i
made
out
a
little
door
which
i
judged
to
be
the
only
one
by
which
she
could
pass
but
to
go
from
there
to
the
casino
was
no
small
matter
since
one
was
obliged
to
fetch
a
wide
course
and
with
one
oar
i
could
not
do
the
passage
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
that
with
much
toil
nevertheless
feeling
sure
of
success
i
told
my
pretty
nun
of
the
plan
and
never
was
news
received
with
so
much
pleasure
we
set
our
watches
together
and
fixed
our
meeting
for
the
friday
following
on
the
day
appointed
an
hour
before
sunset
i
betook
myself
to
francis
de
la
vigne
where
i
kept
my
boat
and
having
set
it
in
order
and
dressed
myself
as
a
boatman
i
got
upon
the
poop
and
held
a
straight
course
for
the
little
door
which
opened
the
moment
i
arrived
m
m
came
out
wrapped
in
a
cloak
and
someone
shutting
the
door
after
her
she
got
on
board
my
frail
bark
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
at
the
casino
m
m
made
haste
to
go
in
but
i
stayed
to
belay
my
boat
with
a
lock
and
chain
against
thieves
who
pass
the
night
pleasantly
by
stealing
whatever
they
can
lay
hands
on
though
i
had
rowed
easily
enough
i
was
in
a
bath
of
perspiration
which
however
by
no
means
hindered
my
charming
mistress
from
falling
on
my
neck
the
pleasure
of
meeting
seemed
to
challenge
her
love
and
proud
of
what
i
had
done
i
enjoyed
her
transports
not
dreaming
that
i
should
have
any
occasion
for
a
change
of
linen
i
had
brought
none
with
me
but
she
soon
found
a
cure
for
this
defect
for
after
having
undressed
me
she
dried
me
lovingly
gave
me
one
of
her
smocks
and
i
found
myself
dressed
to
admiration
we
had
been
too
long
deprived
of
our
amorous
pleasures
to
think
of
taking
supper
before
we
had
offered
a
plenteous
sacrifice
to
love
we
spent
two
hours
in
the
sweetest
of
intoxications
our
bliss
seeming
more
acute
than
at
our
first
meeting
in
spite
of
the
fire
which
consumed
me
in
spite
of
the
ardour
of
my
mistress
i
was
sufficiently
master
of
myself
to
disappoint
her
at
the
critical
moment
for
the
picture
which
our
friend
had
drawn
was
always
before
my
eyes
m
m
joyous
and
wanton
having
me
for
the
first
time
in
the
character
of
boatman
augmented
our
delights
by
her
amorous
caprices
but
it
was
useless
for
her
to
try
to
add
fuel
to
my
flame
since
i
loved
her
better
than
myself
the
night
was
short
for
she
was
obliged
to
return
at
three
in
the
morning
and
it
struck
one
as
we
sat
down
to
table
as
the
climax
of
ill
luck
a
storm
came
on
whilst
we
were
at
supper
our
hair
stood
on
end
our
only
hope
was
founded
in
the
nature
of
these
squalls
which
seldom
last
more
than
an
hour
we
were
in
hopes
also
that
it
would
not
leave
behind
it
too
strong
a
wind
as
is
sometimes
the
case
for
though
i
was
strong
and
sturdy
i
was
far
from
having
the
skill
or
experience
of
a
professional
boatman
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
storm
became
violent
one
flash
of
lightning
followed
another
the
thunder
roared
and
the
wind
grew
to
a
gale
yet
after
a
heavy
rain
in
less
than
an
hour
the
sky
cleared
but
there
was
no
moon
it
being
the
day
after
the
ascension
two
stuck
i
put
my
head
out
at
the
window
but
perceive
that
a
contrary
gale
is
blowing
tiranno
del
mar
libecchio
resta
this
libecchio
which
ariosto
calls
and
with
good
reason
the
tyrant
of
the
sea
is
the
southwesterly
wind
which
is
commonly
called
at
venice
i
said
nothing
but
i
was
frightened
i
told
my
sweetheart
that
we
must
needs
sacrifice
an
hour
of
pleasure
since
prudence
would
have
it
so
let
us
set
out
forthwith
for
if
the
gale
gets
stronger
i
shall
not
be
able
to
double
the
island
she
saw
my
advice
was
not
to
be
questioned
and
taking
the
key
of
her
strong
box
whence
she
desired
to
get
some
money
she
was
delighted
to
find
her
store
increased
fourfold
she
thanked
me
for
having
told
her
nothing
about
it
assuring
me
she
would
have
of
me
nothing
but
my
heart
and
following
me
she
got
into
my
boat
and
lay
down
at
full
length
so
as
not
to
hinder
its
motion
i
got
upon
the
poop
as
full
of
fear
as
courage
and
in
five
minutes
i
had
the
good
luck
to
double
the
point
but
there
it
was
that
the
tyrant
was
waiting
for
me
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
felt
that
my
strength
would
not
outlast
that
of
the
winds
i
rowed
with
all
my
strength
but
all
i
could
do
was
to
prevent
my
boat
from
going
back
for
half
an
hour
i
was
in
this
pitiful
state
and
i
felt
my
strength
failing
without
daring
to
say
a
word
i
was
out
of
breath
but
could
not
rest
a
moment
since
the
least
relaxation
would
have
let
the
boat
slip
a
far
way
back
and
this
would
have
been
a
distance
hard
to
recover
m
m
lay
still
and
silent
for
she
perceived
i
had
no
breath
wherewith
to
answer
her
i
began
to
give
ourselves
up
as
lost
at
that
instant
i
saw
in
the
distance
a
barque
coming
swiftly
towards
us
what
a
piece
of
luck
i
waited
till
she
caught
us
up
for
if
i
had
not
done
so
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
make
myself
heard
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
at
my
left
hand
twelve
feet
off
i
shouted
help
i
will
give
two
sequins
they
lowered
sail
and
came
towards
me
and
on
their
hailing
me
i
asked
for
a
man
to
take
us
to
the
opposite
point
of
the
island
they
asked
a
sequin
in
advance
i
gave
it
them
and
promised
the
other
to
the
man
who
would
get
on
my
poop
and
help
me
to
make
the
point
in
less
than
ten
minutes
we
were
opposite
to
the
little
stream
leading
to
the
convent
but
the
secret
of
it
was
too
dear
to
be
hazarded
so
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
point
i
paid
my
preserver
and
sent
him
back
henceforth
the
wind
was
in
our
favour
and
we
soon
got
to
the
little
door
where
m
m
landed
saying
to
me
go
and
sleep
in
the
casino
i
thought
her
advice
wise
and
i
followed
it
and
having
the
wind
behind
me
i
got
to
the
casino
without
trouble
and
slept
till
broad
day
as
soon
as
i
had
risen
i
wrote
to
my
dear
mistress
that
i
was
well
and
that
we
should
see
each
other
at
the
grating
having
taken
my
boat
back
to
francis
i
put
on
my
mask
and
went
to
liston
in
the
morning
m
m
came
to
the
grating
by
herself
and
we
made
all
such
observations
as
our
adventures
of
the
night
would
be
likely
to
suggest
but
in
place
of
deciding
to
follow
the
advice
which
prudence
should
have
given
not
to
expose
ourselves
to
danger
for
the
future
we
thought
ourselves
extremely
prudent
in
resolving
that
if
we
were
again
threatened
by
a
storm
we
would
set
out
as
soon
as
we
saw
it
rising
all
the
same
we
had
to
confess
that
if
chance
had
not
thrown
the
barque
in
our
way
we
should
have
been
obliged
to
return
to
the
casino
for
m
m
could
not
have
got
to
the
convent
and
how
could
she
ever
have
entered
its
walls
again
i
should
have
been
forced
to
leave
venice
with
her
and
that
for
ever
my
life
would
have
been
finally
and
irretrievably
linked
with
hers
and
without
doubt
the
various
adventures
which
at
the
age
of
years
impel
me
to
write
these
memoirs
would
never
have
taken
place
for
the
next
three
months
we
continued
to
meet
each
other
once
a
week
always
amorous
and
never
disturbed
by
the
slightest
accidents
m
m
could
not
resist
giving
the
ambassador
a
full
account
of
our
adventures
and
i
had
promised
to
write
to
him
and
always
to
write
the
whole
truth
he
replied
by
congratulating
us
on
our
good
fortune
but
he
prophesied
inevitable
disaster
if
we
had
not
the
prudence
to
stop
our
intercourse
murray
the
english
ambassador
a
witty
and
handsome
man
and
a
great
amateur
of
the
fair
sex
wine
and
good
cheer
then
kept
the
fair
ancilla
who
introduced
me
to
him
this
fine
fellow
became
my
friend
in
much
the
same
way
as
de
bernis
the
only
difference
being
that
the
frenchman
liked
to
look
on
while
the
englishman
preferred
to
give
the
show
i
was
never
unwelcome
at
their
amorous
battles
and
the
voluptuous
ancilla
was
delighted
to
have
me
for
a
witness
i
never
gave
them
the
pleasure
of
mingling
in
the
strife
i
loved
m
m
but
i
should
avow
that
my
fidelity
to
her
was
not
entirely
dependent
on
my
love
though
ancilla
was
handsome
she
inspired
me
with
repugnance
for
she
was
always
hoarse
and
complained
of
a
sharp
pain
in
the
throat
and
though
her
lover
kept
well
i
was
afraid
of
her
and
not
without
cause
for
the
disease
which
ended
the
days
of
francis
of
france
brought
her
to
the
grave
in
the
following
autumn
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
she
died
her
brave
briton
yielding
to
the
lascivious
requests
of
this
new
messalina
offered
in
my
presence
the
last
sacrifice
in
spite
of
a
large
sore
on
her
face
which
made
her
look
hideous
this
truly
heroic
action
was
known
all
over
the
town
and
it
was
murray
himself
who
made
it
known
citing
me
as
his
witness
this
famous
courtezan
whose
beauty
was
justly
celebrated
feeling
herself
eaten
away
by
an
internal
disease
promised
to
give
a
hundred
louis
to
a
doctor
named
lucchesi
who
by
dint
of
mercury
undertook
to
cure
her
but
ancilla
specified
on
the
agreement
that
she
was
not
to
pay
the
aforesaid
sum
till
lucchesi
had
offered
with
her
an
amorous
sacrifice
the
doctor
having
done
his
business
as
well
as
he
could
wished
to
be
paid
without
submitting
to
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
but
ancilla
held
her
ground
and
the
matter
was
brought
before
a
magistrate
in
england
where
all
agreements
are
binding
ancilla
would
have
won
her
case
but
at
venice
she
lost
it
the
judge
in
giving
sentence
said
a
condition
criminal
per
se
not
fulfilled
did
not
invalidate
an
agreement
a
sentence
abounding
in
wisdom
especially
in
this
instance
two
months
before
this
woman
had
become
disgusting
my
friend
memmo
afterwards
procurator
asked
me
to
take
him
to
her
house
in
the
height
of
the
conversation
what
should
come
but
a
gondola
and
we
saw
count
rosemberg
the
ambassador
from
vienna
getting
out
of
it
memmo
was
thunderstruck
for
a
venetian
noble
conversing
with
a
foreign
ambassador
becomes
guilty
of
treason
to
the
state
and
ran
in
hot
haste
from
ancilla
room
i
after
him
but
on
the
stair
he
met
the
ambassador
who
seeing
his
distress
burst
into
a
laugh
and
passed
on
i
got
directly
into
memmo
gondola
and
we
went
forthwith
to
cavalli
secretary
to
the
state
inquisitors
memmo
could
have
taken
no
better
course
to
avoid
the
troublesome
consequences
which
this
fatal
meeting
might
have
had
and
he
was
very
glad
that
i
was
with
him
to
testify
to
his
innocence
and
to
the
harmlessness
of
the
occurrence
cavalli
received
memmo
with
a
smile
and
told
him
he
did
well
to
come
to
confession
without
wasting
any
time
memmo
much
astonished
at
this
reception
told
him
the
brief
history
of
the
meeting
and
the
secretary
replied
with
a
grave
air
that
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
his
story
as
the
circumstances
were
in
perfect
correspondence
with
what
he
knew
of
the
matter
we
came
away
extremely
puzzled
at
the
secretary
reply
and
discussed
the
subject
for
some
time
but
then
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
cavalli
could
have
had
no
positive
knowledge
of
the
matter
before
we
came
and
that
he
only
spoke
as
he
did
from
the
instinct
of
an
inquisitor
who
likes
it
to
be
understood
that
nothing
is
hid
from
him
for
a
moment
after
the
death
of
ancilla
murray
remained
without
a
titular
mistress
but
fluttering
about
like
a
butterfly
he
had
one
after
another
the
prettiest
girls
in
venice
this
epicurean
set
out
for
constantinople
two
years
later
and
was
for
twenty
years
the
ambassador
of
the
court
of
james
at
the
sublime
porte
he
returned
to
venice
in
with
the
intention
of
ending
his
days
there
far
from
affairs
of
state
but
he
died
in
the
lazaretto
eight
days
before
the
completion
of
his
quarantine
at
play
fortune
continued
to
favour
me
my
commerce
with
m
m
could
not
be
discovered
now
that
i
was
my
own
waterman
and
the
nuns
who
were
in
the
secret
were
too
deeply
involved
not
to
keep
it
i
led
them
a
merry
life
but
i
foresaw
that
as
soon
as
de
bernis
decided
to
let
m
m
know
that
he
would
not
return
to
venice
he
would
recall
his
people
and
we
should
then
have
the
casino
no
longer
i
knew
besides
that
when
the
rough
season
came
on
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
by
myself
to
continue
our
voyages
the
first
monday
in
october
when
the
theatres
are
opened
and
masks
may
be
worn
i
went
to
francis
to
get
my
boat
and
thence
to
muran
for
my
mistress
afterwards
making
for
the
casino
the
nights
were
now
long
enough
for
us
to
have
ample
time
for
enjoyment
so
we
began
by
making
an
excellent
supper
and
then
devoted
ourselves
to
the
worship
of
love
and
sleep
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
a
moment
of
ecstasy
i
heard
a
noise
in
the
direction
of
the
canal
which
aroused
my
suspicions
and
i
rushed
to
the
window
what
was
my
astonishment
and
anger
to
see
a
large
boat
taking
mine
in
tow
nevertheless
without
giving
way
to
my
passion
i
shouted
to
the
robbers
that
i
would
give
them
ten
sequins
if
they
would
be
kind
enough
to
return
me
my
boat
a
shout
of
laughter
was
all
the
reply
they
made
and
not
believing
what
i
said
they
continued
their
course
what
was
i
to
do
i
dared
not
cry
stop
thief
and
not
being
endued
with
the
power
of
walking
on
the
water
i
could
not
give
chase
to
the
robbers
i
was
in
the
utmost
distress
and
for
the
moment
m
m
shewed
signs
of
terror
for
she
did
not
see
how
i
could
remedy
this
disaster
i
dressed
myself
hastily
giving
no
more
thoughts
to
love
my
only
comfort
being
that
i
had
still
two
hours
to
get
the
indispensable
boat
should
it
cost
me
a
hundred
sequins
i
should
have
been
in
no
perplexity
if
i
had
been
able
to
take
one
but
the
gondoliers
would
infallibly
make
proclamation
over
the
whole
of
muran
that
they
had
taken
a
nun
to
such
a
convent
and
all
would
have
been
lost
the
only
way
then
that
was
open
to
me
was
either
to
buy
a
boat
or
to
steal
one
i
put
my
pistols
and
dagger
in
my
pocket
took
some
money
and
with
an
oar
on
my
shoulder
set
out
the
robbers
had
filed
the
chain
of
my
boat
with
a
silent
file
this
i
could
not
do
and
i
could
only
reckon
on
having
the
good
luck
to
find
a
boat
moored
with
cords
coming
to
the
large
bridge
i
saw
boats
and
to
spare
but
there
were
people
on
the
quay
and
i
would
not
risk
taking
one
seeing
a
tavern
open
at
the
end
of
the
quay
i
ran
like
a
madman
and
asked
if
there
were
any
boatmen
there
the
drawer
told
me
there
were
two
but
that
they
were
drunk
i
came
up
to
them
and
said
who
will
take
me
to
venice
for
eighty
sous
i
and
i
and
they
began
to
quarrel
as
to
who
should
go
i
quieted
them
by
giving
forty
sous
to
the
more
drunken
of
the
two
and
i
went
out
with
the
other
as
soon
as
we
were
on
our
way
i
said
you
are
too
drunk
to
take
me
lend
me
your
boat
and
i
will
give
it
you
back
i
do
know
you
i
will
deposit
ten
sequins
but
your
boat
is
not
worth
that
who
will
be
your
surety
he
took
me
back
to
the
tavern
and
the
drawer
went
bail
for
him
well
pleased
i
took
my
man
to
the
boat
and
having
furnished
it
with
a
second
oar
and
two
poles
he
went
away
chuckling
at
having
made
a
good
bargain
while
i
was
as
glad
to
have
had
the
worst
of
it
i
had
been
an
hour
away
and
on
entering
the
casino
found
my
dear
m
m
in
an
agony
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
my
beaming
face
all
the
laughter
came
back
on
hers
i
took
her
to
the
convent
and
then
went
to
francis
where
the
keeper
of
the
boathouse
looked
as
if
he
thought
me
a
fool
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
trucked
away
my
boat
for
the
one
i
had
with
me
i
put
on
my
mask
and
went
forthwith
to
my
lodging
and
to
bed
for
these
annoyances
had
been
too
much
for
me
about
this
time
my
destiny
made
me
acquainted
with
a
nobleman
called
mark
antony
zorzi
a
man
of
parts
and
famous
for
his
skill
in
writing
verses
in
the
venetian
dialect
zorzi
who
was
very
fond
of
the
play
and
desired
to
offer
a
sacrifice
to
thalia
wrote
a
comedy
which
the
audience
took
the
liberty
of
hissing
but
having
persuaded
himself
that
his
piece
only
failed
through
the
conspiracies
of
the
abbe
chiari
who
wrote
for
the
theatre
of
angelo
he
declared
open
war
against
all
the
plays
i
felt
no
reluctance
whatever
to
visit
zorzi
for
he
possessed
an
excellent
cook
and
a
charming
wife
he
knew
that
i
did
not
care
for
chiari
as
an
author
and
zorzi
had
in
his
pay
people
who
without
pity
rhyme
or
reason
hissed
all
the
compositions
of
the
ecclesiastical
playwright
my
part
was
to
criticise
them
in
hammer
verses
a
kind
of
doggerel
then
much
in
fashion
and
zorzi
took
care
to
distribute
my
lucubrations
far
and
wide
these
manoeuvres
made
me
a
powerful
enemy
in
the
person
of
condulmer
who
liked
me
none
the
better
for
having
all
the
appearance
of
being
in
high
favour
with
madame
zorzi
to
whom
before
my
appearance
he
had
paid
diligent
court
this
condulmer
was
to
be
excused
for
not
caring
for
me
for
having
a
large
share
in
the
angelo
theatre
the
failure
of
the
abbe
pieces
was
a
loss
to
him
as
the
boxes
had
to
be
let
at
a
very
low
rent
and
all
men
are
governed
by
interested
motives
this
condulmer
was
sixty
years
old
but
with
all
the
greenness
of
youth
he
was
still
fond
of
women
gaming
and
money
and
he
was
in
fact
a
but
he
knew
how
to
pass
for
a
saint
as
he
took
care
to
go
to
mass
every
morning
at
mark
and
never
omitted
to
shed
tears
before
the
crucifix
the
following
year
he
was
made
a
councillor
and
in
that
capacity
he
was
for
eight
months
a
state
inquisitor
having
thus
attained
this
or
position
he
had
not
much
difficulty
in
shewing
his
colleagues
the
necessity
of
putting
me
under
the
leads
as
a
disturber
of
the
peace
of
the
republic
in
the
beginning
of
the
winter
the
astounding
news
of
the
treaty
between
france
and
austria
was
divulged
a
treaty
by
which
the
political
balance
was
entirely
readjusted
and
which
was
received
with
incredulity
by
the
powers
the
whole
of
italy
had
reason
to
rejoice
for
the
treaty
guarded
that
fair
land
from
becoming
the
theatre
of
war
on
the
slightest
difference
which
might
arise
between
the
two
powers
what
astonished
the
most
acute
was
that
this
wonderful
treaty
was
conceived
and
carried
out
by
a
young
ambassador
who
had
hitherto
been
famed
only
as
a
wit
the
first
foundations
had
been
laid
in
by
madame
de
pompadour
count
canes
who
was
created
a
prince
and
de
bernis
who
was
not
known
till
the
following
year
when
the
king
made
him
ambassador
to
venice
the
house
of
bourbon
and
the
house
of
hapsburg
had
been
foes
for
two
hundred
and
forty
years
when
this
famous
treaty
was
concluded
but
it
only
lasted
for
forty
years
and
it
is
not
likely
that
any
treaty
will
last
longer
between
two
courts
so
essentially
opposed
to
one
another
the
abbe
de
bernis
was
created
minister
for
foreign
affairs
some
time
after
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
three
years
after
he
the
parliament
became
a
cardinal
was
disgraced
and
finally
sent
to
rome
where
he
died
ultimo
linea
rerum
est
affairs
fell
out
as
i
had
foreseen
for
nine
months
after
he
left
venice
he
conveyed
to
m
m
the
news
of
his
recall
though
he
did
it
in
the
most
delicate
manner
nevertheless
m
m
felt
the
blow
so
severely
that
she
would
very
possibly
have
succumbed
had
i
not
been
preparing
her
for
it
in
every
way
i
could
think
of
de
bernis
sent
me
all
instructions
he
directed
that
all
the
contents
of
the
casino
should
be
sold
and
the
proceeds
given
to
m
m
with
the
exception
of
the
books
and
prints
which
the
housekeeper
was
ordered
to
bring
to
paris
it
was
a
nice
breviary
for
a
cardinal
but
would
to
god
they
had
nothing
worse
whilst
m
m
abandoned
herself
to
grief
i
carried
out
the
orders
of
de
bernis
and
by
the
middle
of
january
we
had
no
longer
a
casino
she
kept
by
her
two
thousand
sequins
and
her
pearls
intending
to
sell
them
later
on
to
buy
herself
an
annuity
we
were
now
only
able
to
see
each
other
at
the
grating
and
soon
worn
with
grief
she
fell
dangerously
ill
and
on
the
of
february
i
recognized
in
her
features
the
symptoms
of
approaching
death
she
sent
me
her
with
all
her
diamonds
and
nearly
all
her
money
all
the
scandalous
books
she
possessed
and
all
her
letters
telling
me
that
if
she
did
not
die
i
was
to
return
her
the
whole
but
that
all
belonged
to
me
if
as
she
thought
she
should
succumb
to
the
disease
she
also
told
me
that
c
c
was
aware
of
her
state
and
asked
me
to
take
pity
on
her
and
write
to
her
as
my
letters
were
her
only
comfort
and
that
she
hoped
to
have
strength
to
read
them
till
her
latest
breath
i
burst
into
tears
for
i
loved
her
passionately
and
i
promised
her
to
come
and
live
in
muran
until
she
recovered
her
health
having
placed
the
property
in
a
gondola
i
went
to
the
bragadin
palace
to
deposit
it
and
then
returned
to
muran
to
get
laura
to
find
me
a
furnished
room
where
i
could
live
as
i
liked
i
know
of
a
good
room
with
meals
provided
she
said
you
will
be
quite
comfortable
and
will
get
it
cheaply
and
if
you
like
to
pay
in
advance
you
need
not
even
say
who
you
are
the
old
man
to
whom
the
house
belongs
lives
on
the
ground
floor
he
will
give
you
all
the
keys
and
if
you
like
you
need
see
no
one
she
gave
me
the
address
and
i
went
there
on
the
spot
and
having
found
everything
to
my
liking
i
paid
a
month
in
advance
and
the
thing
was
done
it
was
a
little
house
at
the
end
of
a
blind
alley
abutting
on
the
canal
i
returned
to
laura
house
to
tell
her
that
i
wanted
a
servant
to
get
my
food
and
to
make
my
bed
and
she
promised
to
get
me
one
by
the
next
day
having
set
all
in
order
for
my
new
lodging
i
returned
to
venice
and
packed
my
mails
as
if
i
were
about
to
make
a
long
journey
after
supper
i
took
leave
of
de
bragadin
and
of
his
two
friends
telling
them
that
i
was
going
to
be
away
for
several
weeks
on
important
business
next
day
going
to
my
new
room
i
was
surprised
to
find
there
tonine
laura
daughter
a
pretty
girl
not
more
than
fifteen
years
old
who
told
me
with
a
blush
but
with
more
spirit
than
i
gave
her
credit
for
that
she
would
serve
me
as
well
as
her
mother
would
have
done
i
was
in
too
much
distress
to
thank
laura
for
this
pretty
present
and
i
even
determined
that
her
daughter
should
not
stay
in
my
service
we
know
how
much
such
resolutions
are
commonly
worth
in
the
meanwhile
i
was
kind
to
the
girl
i
am
sure
i
said
of
your
goodwill
but
i
must
talk
to
your
mother
i
must
be
alone
i
added
as
i
have
to
write
all
day
and
i
shall
not
take
anything
till
the
evening
she
then
gave
me
a
letter
begging
pardon
for
not
having
given
it
me
sooner
you
must
never
forget
to
deliver
messages
i
said
for
if
you
had
waited
any
longer
before
bringing
me
this
letter
it
might
have
had
the
most
serious
consequences
she
blushed
begged
pardon
and
went
out
of
the
room
the
letter
was
from
c
c
who
told
me
that
her
friend
was
in
bed
and
that
the
doctor
had
pronounced
her
illness
to
be
fever
i
passed
the
rest
of
the
day
in
putting
my
room
in
order
and
in
writing
to
c
c
and
her
suffering
friend
towards
evening
tonine
brought
in
the
candles
and
told
me
that
my
supper
was
ready
follow
me
i
said
seeing
that
she
had
only
laid
supper
for
one
a
pleasing
proof
of
her
modesty
i
told
her
to
get
another
knife
and
fork
as
i
wished
her
always
to
take
her
meals
with
me
i
can
give
no
account
of
my
motives
i
only
wished
to
be
kind
to
her
and
i
did
everything
in
good
faith
by
and
by
reader
we
shall
see
whether
this
is
not
one
of
the
devices
by
which
the
devil
compasses
his
ends
not
having
any
appetite
i
ate
little
but
i
thought
everything
good
with
the
exception
of
the
wine
but
tonine
promised
to
get
some
better
by
the
next
day
and
when
supper
was
over
she
went
to
sleep
in
the
after
sealing
my
letters
wishing
to
know
whether
the
outer
door
was
locked
i
went
out
and
saw
tonine
in
bed
sleeping
peacefully
or
pretending
to
do
so
i
might
have
suspected
her
thoughts
but
i
had
never
been
in
a
similar
situation
and
i
measured
the
extremity
of
my
grief
by
the
indifference
with
which
i
looked
at
this
girl
she
was
pretty
but
for
all
that
i
felt
that
neither
she
nor
i
ran
any
risk
next
day
waking
very
early
i
called
her
and
she
came
in
neatly
dressed
i
gave
her
my
letter
to
c
c
which
enclosed
the
letter
to
m
m
telling
her
to
take
it
to
her
mother
and
then
to
return
to
make
my
coffee
i
shall
dine
at
noon
tonine
i
said
take
care
to
get
what
is
necessary
in
good
time
sir
i
prepared
yesterday
supper
myself
and
if
you
like
i
can
cook
all
your
meals
i
am
satisfied
with
your
abilities
go
on
and
here
is
a
sequin
for
expenses
i
still
have
a
hundred
and
twenty
sous
remaining
from
the
one
you
gave
me
yesterday
and
that
will
be
enough
no
they
are
for
yourself
and
i
shall
give
you
as
much
every
day
her
delight
was
so
great
that
i
could
not
prevent
her
covering
my
hand
with
kisses
i
took
care
to
draw
it
back
and
not
to
kiss
her
in
return
for
i
felt
as
if
i
should
be
obliged
to
laugh
and
this
would
have
dishonoured
my
grief
the
second
day
passed
like
the
first
tonine
was
glad
that
i
said
no
more
about
speaking
to
her
mother
and
drew
the
conclusion
that
her
services
were
agreeable
to
me
feeling
tired
and
weak
and
fearing
that
i
should
not
wake
early
enough
to
send
the
letter
to
the
convent
but
not
wishing
to
rouse
tonine
if
she
were
asleep
i
called
her
softly
she
rose
immediately
and
came
into
my
room
with
nothing
on
but
a
slight
petticoat
pretending
to
see
nothing
i
gave
her
my
letter
and
told
her
to
take
it
to
her
mother
in
the
morning
before
she
came
into
my
room
she
went
out
saying
that
my
instructions
should
be
carried
out
but
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
i
could
not
resist
saying
to
myself
that
she
was
very
pretty
and
i
felt
both
sad
and
ashamed
at
the
reflection
that
this
girl
could
very
easily
console
me
i
hugged
my
grief
and
i
determined
to
separate
myself
from
a
being
who
made
me
forget
it
in
the
morning
i
said
i
will
tell
laura
to
get
me
something
less
seducing
but
the
night
brought
counsel
and
in
the
morning
i
put
on
the
armour
of
sophism
telling
myself
that
my
weakness
was
no
fault
of
the
girl
and
that
it
would
therefore
be
unjust
to
punish
her
for
it
we
shall
see
dear
reader
how
all
this
ended
chapter
xxiii
continues
the
preceding
chapter
recovers
i
return
to
venice
tonine
consoles
me
decrease
of
my
love
for
doctor
righelini
curious
conversation
with
him
how
this
conversation
affected
murray
undeceived
and
avenged
tontine
had
what
is
called
tact
and
common
sense
and
thinking
these
qualities
were
required
in
our
economy
she
behaved
with
great
delicacy
not
going
to
bed
before
receiving
my
letters
and
never
coming
into
my
room
except
in
a
proper
dress
and
all
this
pleased
me
for
a
fortnight
m
m
was
so
ill
that
i
expected
every
moment
to
hear
the
news
of
her
death
on
shrove
tuesday
c
c
wrote
that
her
friend
was
not
strong
enough
to
read
my
letter
and
that
she
was
going
to
receive
unction
this
news
so
shocked
me
that
i
could
not
rise
and
passed
the
whole
day
in
weeping
and
writing
tonine
not
leaving
me
till
midnight
i
could
not
sleep
on
ash
wednesday
i
got
a
letter
in
which
c
c
told
me
that
the
doctor
had
no
hopes
for
her
friend
and
that
he
only
gave
her
a
fortnight
to
live
a
low
fever
was
wasting
her
away
her
weakness
was
extreme
and
she
could
scarcely
swallow
a
little
broth
she
had
also
the
misfortune
to
be
harassed
by
her
confessor
who
made
her
foretaste
all
the
terrors
of
death
i
could
only
solace
my
grief
by
writing
and
tonine
now
and
again
made
bold
to
observe
that
i
was
cherishing
my
grief
and
that
it
would
be
the
death
of
me
i
knew
myself
that
i
was
making
my
anguish
more
poignant
and
that
keeping
to
my
bed
continued
writing
and
no
food
would
finally
drive
me
mad
i
had
told
my
grief
to
poor
tonine
whose
chief
duty
was
to
wipe
away
my
tears
she
had
compassion
on
me
a
few
days
later
after
assuring
c
c
that
if
our
friend
died
i
should
not
survive
her
i
asked
her
to
tell
m
m
that
if
she
wanted
me
to
take
care
of
my
life
she
must
promise
to
let
me
carry
her
off
on
her
recovery
i
have
i
said
four
thousand
sequins
and
her
diamonds
which
are
worth
six
thousand
we
should
therefore
have
a
sufficient
sum
to
enable
us
to
live
honourably
in
any
part
of
europe
c
c
wrote
to
me
on
the
following
day
and
said
that
my
mistress
after
hearing
my
letter
read
had
fallen
into
a
kind
of
convulsion
and
becoming
delirious
she
talked
incessantly
in
french
for
three
whole
hours
in
a
fashion
which
would
have
made
all
the
nuns
take
to
their
heels
if
they
had
understood
her
i
was
in
despair
and
was
nearly
raving
as
wildly
as
my
poor
nun
her
delirium
lasted
three
days
and
as
soon
as
she
got
back
her
reason
she
charged
her
young
friend
to
tell
me
that
she
was
sure
to
get
well
if
i
promised
to
keep
to
my
word
and
to
carry
her
off
as
soon
as
her
health
would
allow
i
hastened
to
reply
that
if
i
lived
she
might
be
sure
my
promise
would
be
fulfilled
thus
continuing
to
deceive
each
other
in
all
good
faith
we
got
better
for
every
letter
from
c
c
telling
me
how
the
convalescence
of
her
friend
was
progressing
was
to
me
as
balm
and
as
my
mind
grew
more
composed
my
appetite
also
grew
better
and
my
health
improving
day
by
day
i
soon
though
quite
unconsciously
began
to
take
pleasure
in
the
simple
ways
of
tonine
who
now
never
left
me
at
night
before
she
saw
that
i
was
asleep
towards
the
end
of
march
m
m
wrote
to
me
herself
saying
that
she
believed
herself
out
of
danger
and
that
by
taking
care
she
hoped
to
be
able
to
leave
her
room
after
easter
i
replied
that
i
should
not
leave
muran
till
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
at
the
grating
where
without
hurrying
ourselves
we
could
plan
the
execution
of
our
scheme
it
was
now
seven
weeks
since
de
bragadin
had
seen
me
and
thinking
that
he
would
be
getting
anxious
i
resolved
to
go
and
see
him
that
very
day
telling
tonine
that
i
should
not
be
back
till
the
evening
i
started
for
venice
without
a
cloak
for
having
gone
to
muran
masked
i
had
forgotten
to
take
one
i
had
spent
days
without
going
out
of
my
room
chiefly
in
tears
and
distress
and
without
taking
any
food
i
had
just
gone
through
an
experience
which
flattered
my
i
had
been
served
by
a
girl
who
would
have
passed
for
a
beauty
anywhere
in
europe
she
was
gentle
thoughtful
and
delicate
and
without
being
taxed
with
foppishness
i
think
i
may
say
that
if
she
was
not
in
love
with
me
she
was
at
all
events
inclined
to
please
me
to
the
utmost
of
her
ability
for
all
that
i
had
been
able
to
withstand
her
youthful
charms
and
i
now
scarcely
dreaded
them
seeing
her
every
day
i
had
dispersed
my
amorous
fancies
and
friendship
and
gratitude
seemed
to
have
vanquished
all
other
feelings
for
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
this
charming
girl
had
lavished
on
me
the
most
tender
and
assiduous
care
she
had
passed
whole
nights
on
a
chair
by
my
bedside
tending
me
like
a
mother
and
never
giving
me
the
slightest
cause
for
complaint
never
had
i
given
her
a
kiss
never
had
i
allowed
myself
to
undress
in
her
presence
and
never
with
one
exception
had
she
come
into
my
room
without
being
properly
dressed
for
all
that
i
knew
that
i
had
fought
a
battle
and
i
felt
inclined
to
boast
at
having
won
the
victory
there
was
only
one
circumstance
that
vexed
me
namely
that
i
was
nearly
certain
that
neither
nor
would
consider
such
continence
to
be
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
if
they
heard
of
it
and
that
laura
herself
to
whom
her
daughter
would
tell
the
whole
story
would
be
sceptical
though
she
might
out
of
kindness
pretend
to
believe
it
all
i
got
to
de
bragadin
just
as
the
soup
was
being
served
he
welcomed
me
heartily
and
was
delighted
at
having
foreseen
that
i
should
thus
surprise
them
besides
my
two
other
old
friends
there
were
de
la
haye
bavois
and
righelini
at
table
what
you
without
a
cloak
said
dandolo
yes
said
i
for
having
gone
out
with
my
mask
on
i
forgot
to
bring
one
at
this
they
laughed
and
without
putting
myself
out
i
sat
down
no
one
asked
where
i
had
been
so
long
for
it
was
understood
that
that
question
should
be
left
to
me
to
answer
or
not
nevertheless
de
la
haye
who
was
bursting
with
curiosity
could
not
refrain
from
breaking
some
jests
on
me
you
have
got
so
thin
said
he
that
uncharitable
people
will
be
rather
hard
on
you
i
trust
they
will
not
say
that
i
have
been
passing
my
time
with
the
jesuits
you
are
sarcastic
they
may
say
perhaps
that
you
have
passed
your
time
in
a
under
the
influence
of
mercury
do
be
afraid
sir
for
to
escape
this
hasty
judgment
i
shall
go
back
this
evening
no
no
i
am
quite
sure
you
will
not
believe
me
sir
said
i
with
a
bantering
tone
that
i
deem
your
opinion
of
too
much
consequence
not
to
be
governed
by
it
seeing
that
i
was
in
earnest
my
friends
were
angry
with
him
and
the
aristarchus
was
in
some
confusion
righelini
who
was
one
of
murray
intimate
friends
said
to
me
in
a
friendly
way
that
he
had
been
longing
to
tell
murray
of
my
and
of
the
falsity
of
all
the
reports
about
me
we
will
go
to
sup
with
him
said
i
and
i
will
return
after
supper
seeing
that
de
bragadin
and
his
two
friends
were
uneasy
about
me
i
promised
to
dine
with
them
on
april
mark
day
as
soon
as
murray
saw
me
he
fell
on
my
neck
and
embraced
me
he
introduced
me
to
his
wife
who
asked
me
to
supper
with
great
politeness
after
murray
had
told
me
the
innumerable
stories
which
had
been
made
about
my
disappearance
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
a
little
story
by
the
abbe
chiari
which
had
come
out
at
the
end
of
the
carnival
as
i
said
that
i
knew
nothing
about
it
he
gave
me
a
copy
telling
me
that
i
should
like
it
he
was
right
it
was
a
satire
in
which
the
zorzi
clique
was
pulled
to
pieces
and
in
which
i
played
a
very
poor
part
i
did
not
read
it
till
some
time
after
and
in
the
mean
time
put
it
in
my
pocket
after
a
very
good
supper
i
took
a
gondola
to
return
to
muran
it
was
midnight
and
very
dark
so
that
i
did
not
perceive
the
gondola
to
be
ill
covered
and
in
wretched
order
a
fine
rain
was
falling
when
i
got
in
and
the
drops
getting
larger
i
was
soon
wet
to
the
skin
no
great
harm
was
done
as
i
was
close
to
my
quarters
i
groped
my
way
upstairs
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
where
tonine
who
had
not
waited
for
me
was
sleeping
awake
in
a
moment
she
came
to
open
the
door
in
her
smock
and
without
a
light
as
i
wanted
one
i
told
her
to
get
the
flint
and
steel
which
she
did
warning
me
in
a
modest
voice
that
she
was
not
dressed
that
of
no
consequence
said
i
provided
you
are
covered
she
said
no
more
and
soon
lighted
a
candle
but
she
could
not
help
laughing
when
she
saw
me
dripping
wet
i
only
want
you
my
dear
said
i
to
dry
my
hair
she
quickly
set
to
work
with
powder
and
in
hand
but
her
smock
was
short
and
loose
at
the
top
and
i
repented
rather
too
late
that
i
had
not
given
her
time
to
dress
i
felt
that
all
was
lost
all
the
more
as
having
to
use
both
her
hands
she
could
not
hold
her
smock
and
conceal
two
swelling
spheres
more
seductive
than
the
apples
of
the
hesperides
how
could
i
help
seeing
them
i
shut
my
eyes
and
said
for
shame
but
i
gave
in
at
last
and
fixed
such
a
hungry
gaze
upon
poor
tonine
that
she
blushed
come
said
i
take
your
smock
between
your
teeth
and
then
i
shall
see
no
more
but
it
was
worse
than
before
and
i
had
only
added
fuel
to
the
fire
for
as
the
veil
was
short
i
could
see
the
bases
and
almost
the
frieze
of
two
marble
columns
and
at
this
sight
i
gave
a
voluptuous
cry
not
knowing
how
to
conceal
everything
from
my
gaze
tonine
let
herself
fall
on
the
sofa
and
i
my
passions
at
stood
beside
her
not
knowing
what
to
do
well
she
said
shall
i
go
and
dress
myself
and
then
do
your
hair
no
come
and
sit
on
my
knee
and
cover
my
eyes
with
your
hands
she
came
obediently
but
the
die
was
cast
and
my
resistance
overcome
i
clasped
her
between
my
arms
and
without
any
more
thoughts
of
playing
at
blind
man
buff
i
threw
her
on
the
bed
and
covered
her
with
kisses
and
as
i
swore
that
i
would
always
love
her
she
opened
her
arms
to
receive
me
in
a
way
that
shewed
how
long
she
had
been
waiting
for
this
moment
i
plucked
the
rose
and
then
as
ever
i
thought
it
the
rarest
i
had
ever
gathered
since
i
had
laboured
in
the
harvest
of
the
fruitful
fields
of
love
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
i
found
myself
more
deeply
in
love
with
tonine
than
i
had
been
with
any
other
woman
she
had
got
up
without
waking
me
but
as
soon
as
she
heard
me
stirring
she
came
and
i
tenderly
chid
her
for
not
waiting
for
me
to
give
her
good
morrow
without
answering
she
gave
me
m
m
letter
i
thanked
her
but
putting
the
letter
on
one
side
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
set
her
by
my
side
what
a
wonder
cried
tonine
you
are
not
in
a
hurry
to
read
that
letter
faithless
man
why
did
you
not
let
me
cure
you
six
weeks
ago
how
lucky
i
am
thanks
to
the
rain
i
do
not
blame
you
dear
but
love
me
as
you
love
her
who
writes
to
you
every
day
and
i
shall
be
satisfied
do
you
know
who
she
is
she
lives
in
a
and
is
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
but
she
is
there
and
i
am
here
you
are
my
master
and
i
will
be
your
servant
as
long
as
you
like
i
was
glad
to
leave
her
in
error
and
swore
an
love
but
during
our
conversation
she
had
let
herself
drop
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
bed
and
i
entreated
her
to
lie
down
again
but
she
said
that
on
the
contrary
it
was
time
for
me
to
get
up
for
dinner
for
she
wanted
to
give
me
a
dainty
meal
cooked
in
the
venetian
manner
who
is
the
cook
said
i
i
am
and
i
have
been
using
all
my
skill
on
it
since
five
when
i
got
up
what
time
is
it
now
then
past
one
the
girl
astonished
me
she
was
no
longer
the
shy
tonine
of
last
night
she
had
that
exultant
air
which
happiness
bestows
and
the
look
of
pleasure
which
the
delights
of
love
give
to
a
young
beauty
i
could
not
understand
how
i
had
escaped
from
doing
homage
to
her
beauty
when
i
first
saw
her
at
her
mother
house
but
i
was
then
too
deeply
in
love
with
c
c
i
was
in
too
great
distress
and
moreover
tonine
was
then
unformed
i
got
up
and
making
her
bring
me
a
cup
of
coffee
i
asked
her
to
keep
the
dinner
back
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
found
m
m
letter
affectionate
but
not
so
interesting
as
it
would
have
been
the
day
before
i
set
myself
to
answer
it
and
was
almost
thunderstruck
to
find
the
task
for
the
first
time
a
painful
one
however
my
short
journey
to
venice
supplied
me
with
talk
which
covered
four
pages
i
had
an
exquisite
dinner
with
my
charming
tonine
looking
at
her
as
at
the
same
time
my
wife
my
mistress
and
my
housekeeper
i
was
delighted
to
find
myself
made
happy
at
such
a
cheap
rate
we
spent
the
whole
day
at
the
table
talking
of
our
love
and
giving
each
other
a
thousand
little
marks
of
it
for
there
is
no
such
rich
and
pleasant
matter
for
conversation
as
when
they
who
talk
are
parties
to
an
amorous
suit
she
told
with
charming
simplicity
that
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
could
not
make
me
amorous
of
her
because
i
loved
another
and
that
her
only
hope
was
therefore
in
a
surprise
and
that
she
had
foreseen
the
happy
moment
when
i
told
her
that
she
need
not
dress
herself
to
light
a
candle
tonine
was
naturally
but
she
did
not
know
either
how
to
read
or
to
write
she
was
enchanted
to
see
herself
become
rich
for
she
thought
herself
so
without
a
soul
at
muran
being
able
to
breathe
a
word
against
her
honour
i
passed
three
weeks
in
the
company
of
this
delightful
girl
weeks
which
i
still
reckon
among
the
happiest
of
my
life
and
what
embitters
my
old
age
is
that
having
a
heart
as
warm
as
ever
i
have
no
longer
the
strength
necessary
to
secure
a
single
day
as
blissful
as
those
which
i
owed
to
this
charming
girl
towards
the
end
of
april
i
saw
at
the
grating
looking
thin
and
much
changed
but
out
of
danger
i
therefore
returned
to
venice
in
my
interview
calling
my
attachment
and
tender
feelings
to
my
aid
i
succeeded
in
behaving
myself
in
such
wise
that
she
could
not
possibly
detect
the
change
which
a
new
love
had
worked
in
my
heart
i
shall
be
i
trust
easily
believed
when
i
say
that
i
was
not
imprudent
enough
to
let
her
suspect
that
i
had
given
up
the
idea
of
escaping
with
her
upon
which
she
counted
more
than
ever
i
was
afraid
lest
she
should
fall
ill
again
if
i
took
this
hope
away
from
her
i
kept
my
casino
which
cost
me
little
and
as
i
went
to
see
twice
a
week
i
slept
there
on
those
occasions
and
made
love
with
my
dashing
tonine
having
kept
my
word
with
my
friends
by
dining
with
them
on
day
i
went
with
righelini
to
the
parlour
of
the
vierges
to
see
the
taking
of
the
veil
the
convent
of
the
vierges
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
doge
whom
the
nuns
style
most
serene
father
they
all
belong
to
the
first
families
in
venice
while
i
was
praising
the
beauty
of
mother
m
e
to
righelini
he
whispered
to
me
that
he
could
get
her
me
for
a
money
payment
if
i
were
curious
in
the
matter
a
hundred
sequins
for
her
and
ten
sequins
for
the
was
the
price
fixed
on
he
assured
me
that
murray
had
had
her
and
could
have
her
again
seeing
my
surprise
he
added
that
there
was
not
a
nun
whom
one
could
not
have
by
paying
for
her
that
murray
had
the
courage
to
disburse
five
hundred
sequins
for
a
nun
of
muran
a
rare
beauty
who
was
afterwards
the
mistress
of
the
french
ambassador
though
my
passion
for
m
m
was
on
the
wane
i
felt
my
heart
gripped
as
by
a
hand
of
ice
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
made
no
sign
notwithstanding
i
took
the
story
for
an
atrocious
calumny
but
yet
the
matter
was
too
near
my
heart
for
me
to
delay
in
bringing
it
to
light
at
the
earliest
opportunity
i
therefore
replied
to
righelini
in
the
calmest
manner
possible
that
one
or
two
nuns
might
be
had
for
money
but
that
it
could
happen
very
rarely
on
account
of
the
difficulties
in
most
convents
as
for
the
nun
of
muran
justly
famous
for
her
beauty
if
she
be
m
m
nun
of
the
convent
i
not
only
disbelieve
that
murray
ever
had
her
but
i
am
sure
she
was
never
the
french
ambassador
mistress
if
he
knew
her
it
could
only
have
been
at
the
grating
where
i
really
can
not
say
what
happens
righelini
who
was
an
honourable
and
spirited
man
answered
me
coldly
that
the
english
ambassador
was
a
man
of
his
word
and
that
he
had
the
story
from
his
own
lips
if
murray
he
continued
had
not
told
it
me
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
i
would
make
him
tell
it
you
himself
i
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
take
care
that
he
never
knows
i
told
you
of
it
you
may
rely
on
my
discretion
the
same
evening
supping
at
murray
casino
with
righelini
having
the
matter
at
heart
and
seeing
before
me
the
two
men
who
could
clear
up
everything
to
my
satisfaction
i
began
to
speak
with
enthusiasm
of
the
beauty
of
m
e
whom
i
had
seen
at
the
vierges
here
the
ambassador
struck
in
taking
the
ball
on
the
hop
between
friends
said
he
you
can
get
yourself
the
enjoyment
of
those
charms
if
you
are
willing
to
sacrifice
a
sum
of
money
not
too
much
either
but
you
must
have
the
key
do
you
think
you
have
it
no
i
am
sure
and
had
less
trouble
than
you
might
suppose
if
you
are
sure
i
congratulate
you
and
doubt
no
more
i
envy
your
fortune
for
i
do
believe
a
more
perfect
beauty
could
be
found
in
all
the
convents
of
venice
there
you
are
wrong
mother
m
m
at
in
muran
is
certainly
handsomer
i
have
heard
her
talked
of
and
i
have
seen
her
once
but
i
do
not
think
it
possible
that
she
can
be
procured
for
money
i
think
so
said
he
laughing
and
when
i
think
i
mostly
have
good
reasons
you
surprise
me
but
all
the
same
i
do
mind
betting
you
are
deceived
you
would
lose
as
you
have
only
seen
her
once
i
suppose
you
would
not
recognize
her
portrait
i
should
indeed
as
her
face
left
a
strong
impression
on
my
mind
wait
a
minute
he
got
up
from
the
table
went
out
and
returned
a
minute
after
with
a
box
containing
eight
or
ten
miniatures
all
in
the
same
style
namely
with
hair
in
disorder
and
bare
necks
these
said
i
are
rare
charms
with
which
you
have
doubtless
a
near
acquaintance
yes
and
if
you
recognize
any
of
them
be
discreet
you
need
not
be
afraid
here
are
three
i
recognize
and
this
looks
like
m
m
but
confess
that
you
may
have
been
deceived
at
least
that
you
did
not
have
her
in
the
convent
or
here
for
there
are
women
like
her
why
do
you
think
i
have
been
deceived
i
have
had
her
here
in
her
religious
habit
and
i
have
spent
a
whole
night
with
her
and
it
was
to
her
individually
that
i
sent
a
purse
containing
five
hundred
sequins
i
gave
fifty
to
the
good
procurer
you
have
i
suppose
visited
her
in
the
parlour
after
having
her
here
no
never
as
she
was
afraid
her
titular
lover
might
hear
of
it
you
know
that
was
the
french
ambassador
but
she
only
saw
him
in
the
parlour
she
used
to
go
to
his
house
in
secular
dress
whenever
he
wanted
her
i
was
told
that
by
the
man
who
brought
her
here
have
you
had
her
several
times
only
once
and
that
was
enough
but
i
can
have
her
whenever
i
like
for
a
hundred
sequins
all
that
may
be
the
truth
but
i
would
wager
five
hundred
sequins
that
you
have
been
deceived
you
shall
have
your
answer
in
three
days
i
was
perfectly
certain
i
repeat
that
the
whole
affair
was
a
piece
of
knavery
but
it
was
necessary
to
have
it
proved
and
i
shuddered
when
the
thought
came
into
my
head
that
after
all
it
might
be
a
true
story
in
this
case
i
should
have
been
freed
from
a
good
many
obligations
but
i
was
strongly
persuaded
of
her
innocence
at
all
events
if
i
were
to
find
her
guilty
which
was
amongst
possible
occurrences
i
resigned
myself
to
lose
five
hundred
sequins
as
the
price
of
this
horrible
discovery
and
addition
to
my
experience
of
life
i
was
full
of
restless
anguish
the
worst
perhaps
of
the
torments
of
the
mind
if
the
honest
englishman
had
been
the
victim
of
a
mystification
or
rather
knavery
my
regard
for
m
m
honour
compelled
me
to
find
a
way
to
undeceive
him
without
compromising
her
and
such
was
my
plan
and
thus
fortune
favoured
me
three
or
four
days
after
murray
told
the
doctor
that
he
wished
to
see
me
we
went
to
him
and
he
greeted
me
thus
i
have
won
for
a
hundred
sequins
i
can
have
the
fair
nun
alas
said
i
there
go
my
five
hundred
sequins
no
not
five
hundred
my
dear
fellow
for
i
should
be
ashamed
to
win
so
much
of
you
but
the
hundred
she
would
cost
me
if
i
win
you
shall
pay
for
my
pleasure
and
if
i
lose
i
shall
give
her
nothing
how
is
the
problem
to
be
solved
my
mercury
tells
me
that
we
must
wait
for
a
day
when
masks
are
worn
he
is
endeavouring
at
present
to
find
out
a
way
to
convince
both
of
us
for
otherwise
neither
you
nor
i
would
feel
compelled
to
pay
the
wager
and
if
i
really
have
my
honour
would
not
allow
me
to
let
her
suspect
that
i
had
betrayed
the
secret
no
that
would
be
an
unpardonable
crime
hear
my
plan
which
will
satisfy
us
both
for
after
it
has
been
carried
out
each
of
us
will
be
sure
that
he
has
fairly
won
or
fairly
lost
as
soon
as
you
have
possessed
yourself
of
the
real
or
pretended
nun
leave
her
on
some
pretext
and
meet
me
in
a
place
to
be
agreed
upon
we
will
then
go
together
to
the
convent
and
i
will
ask
for
will
seeing
her
and
speaking
to
her
convince
you
that
the
woman
you
have
left
at
home
is
a
mere
impostor
perfectly
and
i
shall
pay
my
wager
with
the
greatest
willingness
i
may
say
the
same
if
when
i
summon
to
the
parlour
the
tells
us
she
is
ill
or
busy
we
will
go
and
the
wager
will
be
yours
you
will
sup
with
the
fair
and
i
will
go
elsewhere
so
be
it
but
since
all
this
will
be
at
nighttime
it
is
possible
that
when
you
ask
for
her
the
sister
will
tell
you
that
no
one
can
be
seen
at
such
an
hour
then
i
shall
lose
you
are
quite
sure
then
that
if
she
be
in
the
convent
she
will
come
down
that
my
business
i
repeat
if
you
do
speak
to
her
i
shall
hold
myself
to
have
lost
a
hundred
sequins
or
a
thousand
if
you
like
one
ca
speak
plainer
than
that
my
dear
fellow
and
i
thank
you
beforehand
the
only
thing
i
ask
you
is
to
come
sharp
to
time
and
not
to
come
too
late
for
a
convent
will
an
hour
after
sunset
suit
you
admirably
i
shall
also
make
it
my
business
to
compel
my
masked
mistress
to
stop
where
she
is
even
though
it
be
m
herself
some
wo
have
long
to
wait
if
you
will
take
her
to
a
casino
which
i
myself
possess
at
muran
and
where
i
secretly
keep
a
girl
of
whom
i
am
amorous
i
will
take
care
that
she
shall
not
be
there
on
the
appointed
day
and
i
will
give
you
the
key
of
the
casino
i
shall
also
see
that
you
find
a
delicate
cold
supper
ready
that
is
admirable
but
i
must
be
able
to
point
out
the
place
to
my
mercury
true
i
will
give
you
a
supper
the
greatest
secrecy
to
be
observed
between
us
we
will
go
to
my
casino
in
a
gondola
and
after
supper
we
will
go
out
by
the
street
door
thus
you
will
know
the
way
by
land
and
water
you
will
only
have
to
tell
the
procurer
the
name
of
the
canal
and
of
the
house
and
on
the
day
fixed
you
shall
have
the
key
you
will
only
find
there
an
old
man
who
lives
on
the
ground
floor
and
he
will
see
neither
those
who
go
out
nor
those
who
come
in
my
sweetheart
will
see
nothing
and
will
not
be
seen
and
all
trust
me
will
turn
out
well
i
begin
to
think
that
i
have
lost
my
bet
said
the
englishman
who
was
delighted
with
the
plan
but
it
matters
not
i
can
gaily
encounter
either
loss
or
gain
we
made
our
appointment
for
the
next
day
and
separated
on
the
following
morning
i
went
to
muran
to
warn
tonine
that
i
was
going
to
sup
with
her
and
to
bring
two
of
my
friends
and
as
my
english
friend
paid
as
great
court
to
bacchus
as
to
cupid
i
took
care
to
send
my
little
housekeeper
several
bottles
of
excellent
wine
charmed
with
the
prospect
of
doing
the
honours
of
the
table
tonine
only
asked
me
if
my
friends
would
go
away
after
supper
i
said
yes
and
this
reply
made
her
happy
she
only
cared
for
the
dessert
after
leaving
her
i
went
to
the
convent
and
passed
an
hour
with
in
the
parlour
i
was
glad
to
see
that
she
was
getting
back
her
health
and
her
beauty
every
day
and
having
complimented
her
upon
it
i
returned
to
venice
in
the
evening
my
two
friends
kept
their
appointments
to
the
minute
and
we
went
to
my
little
casino
at
two
hours
after
sunset
our
supper
was
delicious
and
my
tonine
charmed
me
with
the
gracefulness
of
her
carriage
i
was
delighted
to
see
righelini
enchanted
and
the
ambassador
dumb
with
admiration
when
i
was
in
love
i
did
not
encourage
my
friends
to
cajole
my
sweetheart
but
i
became
full
of
complaisance
when
time
had
cooled
the
heat
of
my
passion
we
parted
about
midnight
and
having
taken
murray
to
the
spot
where
i
was
to
wait
for
him
on
the
day
of
trial
i
returned
to
compliment
my
charming
tonine
as
she
deserved
she
praised
my
two
friends
and
could
not
express
her
surprise
at
seeing
our
english
friend
going
away
fresh
and
nimble
on
his
feet
notwithstanding
his
having
emptied
by
himself
six
bottles
of
my
best
wine
murray
looked
like
a
fine
bacchus
after
rubens
on
whit
sunday
righelini
came
to
tell
me
that
the
english
ambassador
had
made
all
arrangements
with
the
pretended
procurer
of
for
whit
tuesday
i
gave
him
the
keys
of
my
abode
at
muran
and
told
him
to
assure
murray
that
i
would
keep
the
appointment
at
the
exact
time
arranged
upon
my
impatience
brought
on
palpitation
of
the
heart
which
was
extremely
painful
and
i
passed
the
two
nights
without
closing
an
eye
for
although
i
was
convinced
of
m
m
innocence
my
agitation
was
extreme
but
whence
all
this
anxiety
merely
from
a
desire
to
see
the
ambassador
undeceived
must
in
his
eyes
have
seemed
a
common
prostitute
and
the
moment
in
which
he
would
be
obliged
to
confess
himself
the
victim
of
roguery
would
the
honour
of
the
nun
murray
was
as
impatient
as
myself
with
this
difference
that
whereas
he
looking
upon
the
adventure
as
a
comic
one
only
laughed
i
who
found
it
too
tragic
shuddered
with
indignation
on
tuesday
morning
i
went
to
muran
to
tell
tonine
to
get
a
cold
supper
after
my
instruction
to
lay
the
table
for
two
to
get
wax
lights
ready
and
having
sent
in
several
bottles
of
wine
i
bade
her
keep
to
the
room
occupied
by
the
old
landlord
and
not
to
come
out
till
the
people
who
were
coming
in
the
evening
were
gone
she
promised
to
do
so
and
asked
no
questions
after
leaving
her
i
went
to
the
convent
parlour
and
asked
to
see
m
m
not
expecting
to
see
me
she
asked
me
why
i
had
not
gone
to
the
pageant
of
the
bucentaur
which
the
weather
being
favourable
would
set
out
on
this
day
i
do
not
know
what
i
answered
but
i
know
that
she
found
my
words
little
to
the
purpose
i
came
at
last
to
the
important
point
and
told
her
i
was
going
to
ask
a
favour
of
her
on
which
my
peace
of
mind
depended
but
which
she
must
grant
blindly
without
asking
any
questions
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
sweetheart
said
she
and
be
sure
i
will
refuse
nothing
which
may
be
in
my
power
i
shall
be
here
this
evening
an
hour
after
sunset
and
ask
for
you
at
this
grating
come
i
shall
be
with
another
man
to
whom
i
beg
of
you
to
say
a
few
words
of
politeness
you
can
then
leave
us
let
us
find
some
pretext
to
justify
the
unseasonable
hour
i
will
do
what
you
ask
but
you
can
not
imagine
how
troublesome
it
is
in
a
convent
for
at
six
the
parlours
are
shut
up
and
the
keys
are
taken
to
the
abbess
room
however
as
you
only
want
me
for
five
minutes
i
will
tell
the
abbess
that
i
am
expecting
a
letter
from
my
brother
and
that
it
can
be
sent
to
me
on
this
evening
only
you
must
give
me
a
letter
that
the
nun
who
will
be
with
me
may
be
able
to
say
that
i
have
not
been
guilty
of
deception
you
will
not
come
alone
then
i
should
not
dare
even
to
ask
for
such
a
privilege
very
good
but
try
to
come
with
some
old
nun
who
is
i
will
keep
the
light
in
the
background
pray
do
not
do
so
my
beloved
on
the
contrary
place
it
so
that
you
may
be
distinctly
seen
all
this
is
very
strange
but
i
have
promised
passive
obedience
and
i
will
come
down
with
two
lights
may
i
hope
that
you
will
explain
this
riddle
to
me
at
your
next
interview
by
at
latest
you
shall
know
the
whole
story
my
curiosity
will
prevent
me
from
sleeping
not
so
dear
heart
sleep
peacefully
and
be
sure
of
my
gratitude
the
reader
will
think
that
after
this
conversation
my
heart
was
perfectly
at
rest
but
how
far
was
i
from
resting
i
returned
to
venice
tortured
lest
i
should
be
told
in
the
evening
at
the
door
of
the
cathedral
where
we
were
to
meet
that
the
nun
had
been
obliged
to
put
off
her
appointment
if
that
had
happened
i
should
not
have
exactly
suspected
m
m
but
the
ambassador
would
have
thought
that
i
had
caused
the
scheme
to
miscarry
it
is
certain
that
in
that
case
i
should
not
have
taken
my
man
to
the
parlour
but
should
have
gone
there
sadly
by
myself
i
passed
the
whole
day
in
these
torments
thinking
it
would
never
come
to
an
end
and
in
the
evening
i
put
a
letter
in
my
pocket
and
went
to
my
post
at
the
hour
agreed
upon
fortunately
murray
kept
the
appointment
exactly
is
the
nun
there
said
i
as
soon
as
he
was
near
me
yes
my
dear
fellow
we
will
go
if
you
like
to
the
parlour
but
you
will
find
that
we
shall
be
told
she
is
ill
or
engaged
if
you
like
the
bet
shall
be
off
god
forbid
my
dear
fellow
i
cling
to
that
hundred
ducats
let
us
be
gone
we
presented
ourselves
at
the
wicket
and
i
asked
for
m
m
and
the
doorkeeper
made
me
breathe
again
by
saying
that
i
was
expected
i
entered
the
parlour
with
my
english
friend
and
saw
that
it
was
lighted
by
four
candles
i
can
not
recall
these
moments
without
being
in
love
with
life
i
take
note
not
only
of
my
noble
mistress
innocence
but
also
of
the
quickness
of
her
wit
murray
remained
serious
without
a
smile
on
his
face
full
of
grace
and
beauty
m
m
came
into
the
room
with
a
each
of
them
holding
a
candlestick
she
paid
me
a
compliment
in
good
french
i
gave
her
the
letter
and
looking
at
the
address
and
the
seal
she
put
it
in
her
pocket
after
thanking
me
and
saying
she
would
reply
in
due
course
she
turned
towards
my
companion
i
shall
perhaps
make
you
lose
the
first
act
of
the
opera
said
she
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
madam
is
worth
all
the
operas
in
the
world
you
are
english
i
think
yes
madam
the
english
are
now
the
greatest
people
in
the
world
because
they
are
free
and
powerful
gentlemen
i
wish
you
a
very
good
evening
i
had
never
seen
m
m
looking
so
beautiful
as
then
and
i
went
out
of
the
parlour
ablaze
with
love
and
glad
as
i
had
never
been
before
i
walked
with
long
strides
towards
my
casino
without
taking
notice
of
the
ambassador
who
did
not
hurry
himself
in
following
me
i
waited
for
him
at
my
door
well
said
i
are
you
convinced
now
that
you
have
been
cheated
be
quiet
we
have
time
enough
to
talk
about
that
let
us
go
upstairs
shall
i
come
do
what
do
you
think
i
could
do
by
myself
for
four
hours
with
that
creature
who
is
waiting
for
me
we
will
amuse
ourselves
with
her
had
we
not
better
turn
her
out
no
her
master
is
coming
for
her
at
two
in
the
morning
she
would
go
and
warn
him
and
he
would
escape
my
vengeance
we
will
throw
them
both
out
of
the
window
be
moderate
for
m
m
s
honour
depends
on
the
secrecy
we
observe
let
us
go
upstairs
we
shall
have
some
fun
i
should
like
to
see
the
hussy
murray
was
the
first
to
enter
the
room
as
soon
as
the
girl
saw
me
she
threw
her
handkerchief
over
her
face
and
told
the
ambassador
that
such
behaviour
was
unworthy
of
him
he
made
no
answer
she
was
not
so
tall
as
m
m
and
she
spoke
bad
french
her
cloak
and
mask
were
on
the
bed
but
she
was
dressed
as
a
nun
as
i
wanted
to
see
her
face
i
politely
asked
her
to
do
me
the
favour
of
shewing
it
i
do
know
you
said
she
who
are
you
you
are
in
my
house
and
do
know
who
i
am
i
am
in
your
house
because
i
have
been
betrayed
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
have
to
do
with
a
scoundrel
at
this
word
murray
commanded
her
to
be
silent
calling
her
by
the
name
of
her
honourable
business
and
the
slut
got
up
to
take
her
cloak
saying
she
would
go
murray
pushed
her
back
and
told
her
that
she
would
have
to
wait
for
her
worthy
friend
warning
her
to
make
no
noise
if
she
wanted
to
keep
out
of
prison
put
me
in
prison
with
this
she
directed
her
hand
towards
her
dress
but
i
rushed
forward
and
seized
one
hand
while
murray
mastered
the
other
we
pushed
her
back
on
a
chair
while
we
possessed
ourselves
of
the
pistols
she
carried
in
her
pockets
murray
tore
away
the
front
of
her
holy
habit
and
i
extracted
a
stiletto
eight
inches
long
the
false
nun
weeping
bitterly
all
the
time
will
you
hold
your
tongue
and
keep
quiet
till
capsucefalo
comes
said
the
ambassador
or
go
to
prison
if
i
keep
quiet
what
will
become
of
me
i
promise
to
let
you
go
with
him
perhaps
very
well
then
i
will
keep
quiet
have
you
got
any
more
weapons
hereupon
the
slut
took
off
her
habit
and
her
petticoat
and
if
we
had
allowed
her
she
would
have
soon
been
in
a
state
of
nature
no
doubt
in
the
expectation
of
our
passions
granting
what
our
reason
refused
i
was
much
astonished
to
find
in
her
only
a
false
resemblance
to
i
remarked
as
much
to
the
ambassador
who
agreed
with
me
but
made
me
confess
that
most
men
prepossessed
with
the
idea
that
they
were
going
to
see
would
have
fallen
into
the
same
trap
in
fact
the
longing
to
possess
one
self
of
a
nun
who
has
renounced
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
and
especially
that
of
cohabitation
with
the
other
sex
is
the
very
apple
of
eve
and
is
more
delightful
from
the
very
difficulty
of
penetrating
the
convent
grating
few
of
my
readers
will
fail
to
testify
that
the
sweetest
pleasures
are
those
which
are
hardest
to
be
won
and
that
the
prize
to
obtain
which
one
would
risk
one
life
would
often
pass
unnoticed
if
it
were
freely
offered
without
difficulty
or
hazard
in
the
following
chapter
dear
reader
you
will
see
the
end
of
this
farcical
adventure
in
the
mean
time
let
us
take
a
little
breath
chapter
xxiv
pleasant
ending
of
the
adventure
of
the
false
nun
finds
out
that
i
have
a
mistress
she
is
avenged
on
the
wretch
capsucefalo
i
ruin
myself
at
play
and
at
the
suggestion
of
i
sell
all
her
diamonds
one
after
another
i
hand
over
tonine
to
murray
who
makes
provision
for
her
her
sister
barberine
takes
her
place
how
did
you
make
this
nice
acquaintance
i
asked
the
ambassador
six
months
ago
he
replied
while
standing
at
the
convent
gate
with
smith
our
consul
in
whose
company
i
had
been
to
see
some
ceremony
or
other
i
remarked
to
him
as
we
were
talking
over
some
nuns
we
had
noticed
would
gladly
give
five
hundred
sequins
for
a
few
hours
of
sister
m
m
s
company
count
capsucefalo
heard
what
i
said
but
made
no
remark
smith
answered
that
one
could
only
see
her
at
the
grating
as
did
the
ambassador
of
france
who
often
came
to
visit
her
capsucefalo
called
on
me
the
next
morning
and
said
that
if
i
had
spoken
in
good
faith
he
was
sure
he
could
get
me
a
night
with
the
nun
in
whatever
place
i
liked
if
she
could
count
on
my
secrecy
have
just
been
speaking
to
her
said
he
on
my
mentioning
your
name
she
said
she
had
noticed
you
with
smith
and
vowed
she
would
sup
with
you
more
for
love
than
money
said
the
rascal
the
only
man
she
trusts
and
i
take
her
to
the
french
ambassador
casino
in
venice
whenever
she
wants
to
go
there
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
cheated
as
you
will
give
the
money
to
her
personally
when
you
have
possessed
yourself
of
her
with
this
he
took
her
portrait
from
his
pocket
and
shewed
it
me
and
here
it
is
i
bought
it
of
him
two
days
after
i
believed
myself
to
have
spent
a
night
with
the
charming
nun
and
a
fortnight
after
our
conversation
this
beauty
here
came
masked
in
a
nun
habit
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
think
i
had
got
a
treasure
i
am
vexed
with
myself
for
not
having
suspected
the
cheat
at
all
events
when
i
saw
her
hair
as
i
know
that
nuns
hair
should
be
cut
short
but
when
i
said
something
about
it
to
the
hussy
she
told
me
they
were
allowed
to
keep
their
hair
under
their
caps
and
i
was
weak
enough
to
believe
her
i
knew
that
on
this
particular
murray
had
not
been
deceived
but
i
did
not
feel
compelled
to
tell
him
so
then
and
there
i
held
the
portrait
murray
had
given
me
in
my
hand
and
compared
it
with
the
face
before
me
in
the
portrait
the
breast
was
bare
and
as
i
was
remarking
that
painters
did
those
parts
as
best
they
could
the
impudent
wench
seized
the
opportunity
to
shew
me
that
the
miniature
was
faithful
to
nature
i
turned
my
back
upon
her
with
an
expression
of
contempt
which
would
have
mortified
her
if
these
creatures
were
ever
capable
of
shame
as
we
talked
things
over
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
axiom
things
which
are
equal
to
the
same
thing
are
equal
to
one
another
for
the
miniature
was
like
and
like
the
courtezan
and
yet
the
two
women
were
not
like
each
other
murray
agreed
with
me
and
we
spent
an
hour
in
a
philosophical
discussion
on
the
matter
as
the
false
was
named
innocente
we
expressed
a
wish
to
know
how
her
name
agreed
with
her
profession
and
how
the
knave
had
induced
her
to
play
the
part
she
had
taken
and
she
told
us
the
following
story
i
have
known
count
capsucefalo
for
two
years
and
have
found
him
useful
for
though
he
has
given
me
no
money
he
has
made
me
profit
largely
through
the
people
he
has
introduced
to
me
about
the
end
of
last
autumn
he
came
to
me
one
day
and
said
that
if
i
could
make
up
as
a
nun
with
some
clothes
he
would
get
me
and
in
that
character
pass
a
night
with
an
englishman
i
should
be
the
better
by
five
hundred
sequins
need
not
be
afraid
of
anything
said
he
i
myself
will
take
you
to
the
casino
where
the
dupe
will
be
awaiting
you
and
i
will
come
and
take
you
back
to
your
imaginary
convent
towards
the
end
of
the
night
he
shewed
me
how
i
must
behave
and
told
me
what
to
reply
if
my
lover
asked
any
questions
about
the
discipline
of
the
convent
i
liked
the
plot
gentlemen
and
i
told
him
i
was
ready
to
carry
it
out
and
be
pleased
to
consider
that
there
are
not
many
women
of
my
profession
who
would
hesitate
over
a
chance
of
getting
five
hundred
sequins
finding
the
scheme
both
agreeable
and
profitable
i
promised
to
play
my
part
with
the
greatest
skill
the
bargain
was
struck
and
he
gave
me
full
instructions
as
to
my
dialogue
he
told
me
that
the
englishman
could
only
talk
about
my
convent
and
any
lovers
i
might
have
had
that
on
the
latter
point
i
was
to
cut
him
short
and
to
answer
with
a
laugh
that
i
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
about
and
even
to
tell
him
that
i
was
a
nun
in
appearance
only
and
that
in
the
course
of
toying
i
might
let
him
see
my
hair
said
capsucefalo
prevent
him
from
thinking
you
a
nun
yes
and
the
very
nun
he
is
amorous
of
for
he
will
have
made
up
his
mind
that
you
can
not
possibly
be
anyone
else
seizing
the
point
of
the
jest
i
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
nun
i
was
to
represent
nor
the
convent
whence
i
was
to
come
the
only
thing
in
my
head
was
the
five
hundred
sequins
so
little
have
i
troubled
about
aught
else
that
though
i
passed
a
delicious
night
with
you
and
found
you
rather
worthy
of
being
paid
for
than
paying
i
have
not
ascertained
who
and
what
you
are
and
i
do
know
at
this
moment
to
whom
i
am
speaking
you
know
what
a
night
i
had
i
have
told
you
it
was
delicious
and
i
was
happy
in
the
idea
that
i
was
going
to
have
another
you
have
found
everything
out
i
am
sorry
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
since
i
can
put
on
any
disguise
i
like
and
ca
prevent
my
lovers
taking
me
for
a
saint
if
they
like
to
do
so
you
have
found
weapons
in
my
possession
but
everyone
is
allowed
to
bear
arms
in
i
plead
not
guilty
on
all
counts
do
you
know
me
said
i
no
but
i
have
often
seen
you
passing
under
my
window
i
live
at
roch
near
the
bridge
the
way
in
which
the
woman
told
her
yarn
convinced
us
that
she
was
an
adept
in
the
science
of
prostitution
but
we
thought
capsucefalo
in
spite
of
the
count
worthy
of
the
pillory
the
girl
was
about
ten
years
older
than
she
was
pretty
but
while
my
beautiful
nun
had
fine
dark
brown
hair
and
was
at
least
three
inches
taller
after
twelve
we
sat
down
to
supper
and
did
honour
to
the
excellent
meal
which
my
dear
antoinette
had
prepared
for
us
we
were
cruel
enough
to
leave
the
poor
wretch
without
offering
her
so
much
as
a
glass
of
wine
but
we
thought
it
our
duty
while
we
were
talking
the
jolly
englishman
made
some
witty
comments
on
my
eagerness
to
convince
him
that
he
had
not
enjoyed
favours
i
ca
believe
said
he
that
you
have
shewn
so
much
interest
without
being
in
love
with
the
divine
nun
i
answered
by
saying
that
if
i
were
her
lover
i
was
much
to
be
pitied
in
being
condemned
to
go
to
the
parlour
and
no
farther
i
would
gladly
give
a
hundred
guineas
a
month
said
he
to
have
the
privilege
of
visiting
her
at
the
grating
so
saying
he
gave
me
my
hundred
sequins
complimenting
me
on
my
success
and
i
slipped
them
forthwith
into
my
pocket
at
two
in
the
morning
we
heard
a
soft
knock
on
the
street
door
here
is
our
friend
i
said
be
discreet
and
you
will
see
that
he
will
make
a
full
confession
he
came
in
and
saw
murray
and
the
lady
but
did
not
discover
that
a
third
party
was
present
till
he
heard
the
door
being
locked
he
turned
round
and
saw
me
and
as
he
knew
me
merely
said
without
losing
countenance
ah
you
are
here
you
know
of
course
that
the
secret
must
be
kept
murray
laughed
and
calmly
asked
him
to
be
seated
and
he
enquired
with
the
lady
pistols
in
his
hands
where
he
was
going
to
take
her
before
home
i
think
you
may
be
mistaken
as
it
is
very
possible
that
when
you
leave
this
place
you
will
both
of
you
be
provided
with
a
bed
in
prison
no
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
happening
the
thing
would
make
too
much
noise
and
the
laugh
would
not
be
on
your
side
come
said
he
to
his
mate
put
on
your
cloak
and
let
us
be
off
the
ambassador
who
like
an
englishman
kept
quite
cool
the
whole
time
poured
him
out
a
glass
of
chambertin
and
the
blackguard
drank
his
health
murray
seeing
he
had
on
a
fine
ring
set
with
brilliants
praised
it
and
shewing
some
curiosity
to
see
it
more
closely
he
drew
it
off
the
fellow
finger
examined
it
found
it
without
flaw
and
asked
how
much
it
was
worth
capsucefalo
a
little
taken
aback
said
it
cost
him
four
hundred
sequins
i
will
hold
it
as
a
pledge
for
that
sum
said
the
ambassador
putting
the
ring
into
his
pocket
the
other
looked
and
murray
laughing
at
his
retiring
manners
told
the
girl
to
put
on
her
cloak
and
to
pack
off
with
her
worthy
acolyte
she
did
so
directly
and
with
a
low
bow
they
disappeared
farewell
nun
procurer
said
the
ambassador
but
the
count
made
no
answer
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
i
thanked
murray
warmly
for
the
moderation
he
had
shewn
as
a
scandal
would
have
only
injured
three
innocent
people
be
sure
said
he
that
the
guilty
parties
shall
be
punished
without
anyone
knowing
the
reason
i
then
made
tonine
come
upstairs
and
my
english
friend
offered
her
a
glass
of
wine
which
she
declined
with
much
modesty
and
politeness
murray
looked
at
her
with
flaming
glances
and
left
after
giving
me
his
heartiest
thanks
poor
little
tonine
had
been
resigned
and
obedient
for
many
hours
and
she
had
good
cause
to
think
i
had
been
unfaithful
to
her
however
i
gave
her
the
most
unmistakable
proofs
of
my
fidelity
we
stayed
in
bed
for
six
hours
and
rose
happy
in
the
morning
after
dinner
i
hurried
off
to
my
noble
m
m
and
told
her
the
whole
story
she
listened
eagerly
her
various
feelings
flitting
across
her
face
fear
anger
wrath
approval
of
my
method
of
clearing
up
my
natural
suspicions
joy
at
discovering
me
still
her
lover
all
were
depicted
in
succession
in
her
glance
and
in
the
play
of
her
features
and
in
the
red
and
white
which
followed
one
another
on
her
cheeks
and
forehead
she
was
delighted
to
hear
that
the
masker
who
was
with
me
in
the
parlour
was
the
english
ambassador
but
she
became
nobly
disdainful
when
i
told
her
that
he
would
gladly
give
a
hundred
guineas
a
month
for
the
pleasure
of
visiting
her
in
the
parlour
she
was
angry
with
him
for
fancying
that
she
had
been
in
his
power
and
for
finding
a
likeness
between
her
and
a
portrait
when
so
she
said
there
was
no
likeness
at
all
i
had
given
her
the
portrait
she
added
with
a
shrewd
smile
that
she
was
sure
i
had
not
let
my
little
maid
see
the
false
nun
as
she
might
have
been
mistaken
you
know
do
you
that
i
have
a
young
servant
yes
and
a
pretty
one
too
she
is
laura
daughter
and
if
you
love
her
i
am
very
glad
and
so
is
c
c
i
hope
you
will
let
me
have
a
sight
of
her
c
c
has
seen
her
before
as
i
saw
that
she
knew
too
much
for
me
to
be
able
to
deceive
her
i
took
my
cue
directly
and
told
her
in
detail
the
history
of
my
amours
she
shewed
her
satisfaction
too
openly
not
to
be
sincere
before
i
left
her
she
said
her
honour
obliged
her
to
get
capsucefalo
assassinated
for
the
wretch
had
wronged
her
beyond
pardon
by
way
of
quieting
her
i
promised
that
if
the
ambassador
did
not
rid
us
of
him
within
the
week
i
would
charge
myself
with
the
execution
of
our
common
vengeance
about
this
time
died
bragadin
the
procurator
brother
of
my
patron
leaving
de
bragadin
sufficiently
well
off
however
as
the
family
threatened
to
become
extinct
he
desired
a
woman
who
had
been
his
mistress
and
of
whom
he
had
had
a
natural
son
to
become
his
wife
by
this
marriage
the
son
would
have
become
legitimate
and
the
family
renewed
again
the
college
of
cardinals
would
have
recognized
the
wife
for
a
small
fee
and
all
would
have
gone
admirably
the
woman
wrote
to
me
asking
me
to
call
on
her
and
i
was
going
to
curious
to
know
what
a
woman
whom
i
did
not
know
from
adam
could
want
with
me
when
i
received
a
summons
from
de
bragadin
he
begged
me
to
ask
paralis
if
he
ought
to
follow
de
la
haye
advice
in
a
matter
he
had
promised
not
to
confide
to
me
but
of
which
the
oracle
must
be
informed
the
oracle
naturally
opposed
to
the
jesuit
told
him
to
consult
his
own
feelings
and
nothing
else
after
this
i
went
to
the
lady
she
began
by
telling
me
the
whole
story
she
introduced
her
son
to
me
and
told
me
that
if
the
marriage
could
be
performed
a
deed
would
be
delivered
in
my
favour
by
which
at
the
death
of
de
bragadin
i
should
become
entitled
to
an
estate
worth
five
thousand
crowns
per
annum
as
i
guessed
without
much
trouble
that
this
was
the
same
matter
which
de
la
haye
had
proposed
to
de
bragadin
i
answered
without
hesitation
that
since
de
la
haye
was
before
me
i
could
do
nothing
and
thereupon
made
her
my
bow
i
could
not
help
wondering
at
this
jesuit
continually
intriguing
to
marry
my
old
friends
without
my
knowledge
two
years
ago
if
i
had
not
set
my
face
against
it
he
would
have
married
dandolo
i
cared
not
a
whit
whether
the
family
of
bragadin
became
extinct
or
not
but
i
did
care
for
the
life
of
my
benefactor
and
was
quite
sure
that
marriage
would
shorten
it
by
many
years
he
was
already
and
had
recovered
from
a
serious
apoplectic
stroke
i
went
to
dine
with
lady
murray
who
are
daughters
of
lords
keep
the
title
and
after
dinner
the
ambassador
told
me
that
he
had
told
cavalli
the
whole
story
of
the
false
nun
and
that
the
secretary
had
informed
him
the
evening
before
that
everything
had
been
done
to
his
liking
count
capsucefalo
had
been
sent
to
cephalonia
his
native
country
with
the
order
never
to
return
to
venice
and
the
courtezan
had
disappeared
the
fine
part
or
rather
the
fearful
part
about
these
sentences
is
that
no
one
ever
knows
the
reason
why
or
wherefore
and
that
the
lot
may
fall
on
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
was
delighted
with
the
event
and
i
was
more
pleased
than
she
for
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
have
been
obliged
to
soil
my
hands
with
the
blood
of
that
rascally
count
there
are
seasons
in
the
life
of
men
which
may
be
called
and
i
have
proved
this
often
in
my
long
career
and
on
the
strength
of
the
rubs
and
struggles
i
have
had
to
encounter
i
am
able
as
well
as
any
man
to
verify
the
truth
of
this
axiom
i
had
just
experienced
a
run
of
luck
fortune
had
befriended
me
at
play
i
had
been
happy
in
the
society
of
men
and
from
love
i
had
nothing
to
ask
but
now
the
reverse
of
the
medal
began
to
appear
love
was
still
kind
but
fortune
had
quite
left
me
and
you
will
soon
see
reader
that
men
used
me
no
better
than
the
blind
goddess
nevertheless
since
one
fate
has
phases
as
well
as
the
moon
good
follows
evil
as
disasters
succeed
to
happiness
i
still
played
on
the
martingale
but
with
such
bad
luck
that
i
was
soon
left
without
a
sequin
as
i
shared
my
property
with
i
was
obliged
to
tell
her
of
my
losses
and
it
was
at
her
request
that
i
sold
all
her
diamonds
losing
what
i
got
for
them
she
had
now
only
five
hundred
sequins
by
her
there
was
no
more
talk
of
her
escaping
from
the
convent
for
we
had
nothing
to
live
on
i
still
gamed
but
for
small
stakes
waiting
for
the
slow
return
of
good
luck
one
day
the
english
ambassador
after
giving
me
a
supper
at
his
casino
with
the
celebrated
fanny
murray
asked
me
to
let
him
sup
at
my
casino
at
muran
which
i
now
only
kept
up
for
the
sake
of
tonine
i
granted
him
the
favour
but
did
not
imitate
his
generosity
he
found
my
little
mistress
smiling
and
polite
but
always
keeping
within
the
bounds
of
decency
from
which
he
would
have
very
willingly
excused
her
the
next
morning
he
wrote
to
me
as
follows
i
am
madly
in
love
with
tonine
if
you
like
to
hand
her
over
to
me
i
will
make
the
following
provision
for
her
i
will
set
her
up
in
a
suitable
lodging
which
i
will
furnish
throughout
and
which
i
will
give
to
her
with
all
its
contents
provided
that
i
may
visit
her
whenever
i
please
and
that
she
gives
me
all
the
rights
of
a
fortunate
lover
i
will
give
her
a
maid
a
cook
and
thirty
sequins
a
month
as
provision
for
two
people
without
reckoning
the
wine
which
i
will
procure
myself
besides
this
i
will
give
her
a
life
income
of
two
hundred
crowns
per
annum
over
which
she
will
have
full
control
after
living
with
me
for
a
year
i
give
you
a
week
to
send
your
answer
i
replied
immediately
that
i
would
let
him
know
in
three
days
whether
his
proposal
were
accepted
for
tonine
had
a
mother
of
whom
she
was
fond
and
she
would
possibly
not
care
to
do
anything
without
her
consent
i
also
informed
him
that
in
all
appearance
the
girl
was
with
child
the
business
was
an
important
one
for
tonine
i
loved
her
but
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
we
could
not
pass
the
rest
of
our
lives
together
and
i
saw
no
prospect
of
being
able
to
make
her
as
good
a
provision
as
that
offered
by
the
ambassador
consequently
i
had
no
doubts
on
the
question
and
the
very
same
day
i
went
to
muran
and
told
her
all
you
wish
to
leave
me
then
said
she
in
tears
i
love
you
dearest
and
what
i
propose
ought
to
convince
you
of
my
love
not
so
i
can
not
serve
two
masters
you
will
only
serve
your
new
lover
sweetheart
i
beg
of
you
to
reflect
that
you
will
have
a
fine
dowry
on
the
strength
of
which
you
may
marry
well
and
that
however
much
i
love
you
i
can
not
possibly
make
so
good
a
provision
for
you
leave
me
for
tears
and
reflection
and
come
to
supper
with
me
i
did
not
fail
to
keep
the
appointment
i
think
your
english
friend
is
a
very
pretty
man
she
said
and
when
he
speaks
in
the
venetian
dialect
it
makes
me
die
with
laughter
if
my
mother
agrees
i
might
perhaps
force
myself
to
love
him
supposing
we
did
not
agree
we
could
part
at
the
end
of
a
year
and
i
should
be
the
richer
by
an
income
of
two
hundred
crowns
i
am
charmed
with
the
sense
of
your
arguments
speak
about
it
to
your
mother
i
dare
sweetheart
this
kind
of
thing
is
too
delicate
to
be
discussed
between
a
mother
and
her
daughter
speak
to
her
yourself
i
will
indeed
laura
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
she
had
given
me
her
daughter
asked
for
no
time
to
think
it
over
but
full
of
glee
told
me
that
now
her
daughter
would
be
able
to
soothe
her
declining
years
and
that
she
would
leave
muran
of
which
she
was
tired
she
shewed
me
a
hundred
and
thirty
sequins
which
tonine
had
gained
in
my
service
and
which
she
had
placed
in
her
hands
barberine
tonine
younger
sister
came
to
kiss
my
hand
i
thought
her
charming
and
i
gave
her
all
the
silver
in
my
pocket
i
then
left
telling
laura
that
i
should
expect
her
at
my
house
she
soon
followed
me
and
gave
her
child
a
mother
blessing
telling
her
that
she
and
her
family
could
go
and
live
in
venice
for
sixty
sous
a
day
tonine
embraced
her
and
told
her
that
she
should
have
it
this
important
affair
having
been
managed
to
everybody
satisfaction
i
went
to
see
m
m
who
came
into
the
parlour
with
c
c
whom
i
found
looking
sad
though
prettier
than
ever
she
was
melancholy
but
none
the
less
tender
she
could
not
stay
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
fear
of
being
seen
as
she
was
forbidden
ever
to
go
into
the
parlour
i
told
the
story
of
tonine
who
was
going
to
live
with
murray
in
venice
she
was
sorry
to
hear
it
for
said
she
now
that
you
have
no
longer
any
attraction
at
muran
i
shall
see
you
less
than
ever
i
promised
to
come
and
see
her
often
but
vain
promises
the
time
was
near
which
parted
us
for
ever
the
same
evening
i
went
to
tell
the
good
news
to
my
friend
murray
he
was
in
a
transport
of
joy
and
begged
me
to
come
and
sup
with
him
at
his
casino
the
day
after
next
and
to
bring
the
girl
with
me
that
the
surrender
might
be
made
in
form
i
did
not
fail
him
for
once
the
matter
was
decided
i
longed
to
bring
it
to
an
end
in
my
presence
he
assigned
to
her
the
yearly
income
for
her
life
of
two
hundred
venetian
ducats
and
by
a
second
deed
he
gave
her
all
the
contents
of
the
house
with
which
he
was
going
to
provide
her
provided
always
that
she
lived
with
him
for
a
year
he
allowed
her
to
receive
me
as
a
friend
also
to
receive
her
mother
and
sisters
and
she
was
free
to
go
and
see
them
when
she
would
tonine
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
assured
him
that
she
would
endeavour
to
please
him
to
the
utmost
of
her
ability
i
will
see
him
said
she
pointing
to
me
but
as
his
friend
he
shall
have
nothing
more
from
me
throughout
this
truly
affecting
scene
she
kept
back
her
tears
but
i
could
not
conceal
mine
murray
was
happy
but
i
was
not
long
a
witness
of
his
good
fortune
the
reason
of
which
i
will
explain
a
little
later
three
days
afterwards
laura
came
to
me
told
me
that
she
was
living
in
venice
and
asked
me
to
take
her
to
her
daughter
i
owed
this
woman
too
much
to
refuse
her
and
i
took
her
there
forthwith
tonine
gave
thanks
to
god
and
also
to
me
and
her
mother
took
up
the
song
for
they
were
not
quite
sure
whether
they
were
more
indebted
to
god
or
to
me
tonine
was
eloquent
in
her
praise
of
murray
and
made
no
complaint
at
my
not
having
come
to
see
her
at
which
i
was
glad
as
i
was
going
laura
asked
me
to
take
her
back
in
my
gondola
and
as
we
had
to
pass
by
the
house
in
which
she
lived
she
begged
me
to
come
in
for
a
moment
and
i
could
not
hurt
her
feelings
by
refusing
i
owe
it
to
my
honour
to
remark
here
that
i
was
thus
polite
without
thinking
that
i
should
see
barberine
again
this
girl
as
pretty
as
her
sister
though
in
another
style
began
by
awakening
my
curiosity
a
weakness
which
usually
renders
the
profligate
man
inconstant
if
all
women
were
to
have
the
same
features
the
same
disposition
and
the
same
manners
men
would
not
only
never
be
inconstant
but
would
never
be
in
love
under
that
state
of
things
one
would
choose
a
wife
by
instinct
and
keep
to
her
till
death
but
our
world
would
then
be
under
a
different
system
to
the
present
novelty
is
the
master
of
the
soul
we
know
that
what
we
do
not
see
is
very
nearly
the
same
as
what
we
have
seen
but
we
are
curious
we
like
to
be
quite
sure
and
to
attain
our
ends
we
give
ourselves
as
much
trouble
as
if
we
were
certain
of
finding
some
prize
beyond
compare
barberine
who
looked
upon
me
as
an
old
friend
for
her
mother
had
accustomed
her
to
kiss
my
hand
whenever
i
went
there
who
had
undressed
more
than
once
in
my
presence
without
troubling
about
me
who
knew
i
had
made
her
sister
fortune
and
the
family
fortune
as
well
and
thought
herself
prettier
than
tonine
because
her
skin
was
fairer
and
because
she
had
fine
black
eyes
desiring
to
take
her
sister
place
knew
that
to
succeed
she
must
take
me
by
storm
her
common
sense
told
her
that
as
i
hardly
ever
came
to
the
house
i
should
not
be
likely
to
become
amorous
of
her
unless
she
won
me
by
storm
and
to
this
end
she
shewed
the
utmost
complaisance
when
she
had
the
chance
so
that
i
won
her
without
any
difficulty
all
this
reasoning
came
from
her
own
head
for
i
am
sure
her
mother
gave
her
no
instructions
laura
was
a
mother
of
a
kind
common
the
world
over
but
especially
in
italy
she
was
willing
to
take
advantage
of
the
earnings
of
her
daughters
but
she
would
never
have
induced
them
to
take
the
path
of
evil
there
her
virtue
stopped
short
after
i
had
inspected
her
two
rooms
and
her
little
kitchen
and
had
admired
the
cleanness
which
shone
all
around
barberine
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
see
their
small
garden
with
pleasure
i
replied
for
a
garden
is
a
rarity
in
venice
her
mother
told
her
to
give
me
some
figs
if
there
were
any
ripe
ones
the
garden
consisted
of
about
thirty
square
feet
and
grew
only
salad
herbs
and
a
fine
fig
tree
it
had
not
a
good
crop
and
i
told
her
that
i
could
not
see
any
figs
i
can
see
some
at
the
top
said
barberine
and
i
will
gather
them
if
you
will
hold
me
the
ladder
yes
climb
away
i
will
hold
it
quite
firmly
she
stepped
up
lightly
and
stretching
out
an
arm
to
get
at
some
figs
to
one
side
of
her
she
put
her
body
off
its
balance
holding
on
to
the
ladder
with
the
other
hand
my
dear
barberine
what
do
you
think
i
can
see
what
you
have
often
seen
with
my
sister
that
true
but
you
are
prettier
than
she
is
the
girl
made
no
reply
but
as
if
she
could
not
reach
the
fruit
she
put
her
foot
on
a
high
branch
and
spewed
me
the
most
seductive
picture
i
was
in
an
ecstasy
and
barberine
who
saw
it
did
not
hurry
herself
at
last
i
helped
her
to
come
down
and
letting
my
hand
wander
indiscreetly
i
asked
her
if
the
fruit
i
held
had
been
plucked
and
she
kept
me
a
long
time
telling
me
it
was
quite
fresh
i
took
her
within
my
arms
and
already
her
captive
i
pressed
her
amorously
to
my
heart
printing
on
her
lips
a
fiery
kiss
which
she
gave
me
back
with
as
much
ardour
will
you
give
me
what
i
have
caught
dearest
my
mother
is
going
to
muran
and
she
will
stay
there
all
the
day
if
you
come
there
is
nothing
i
will
refuse
you
when
speech
like
this
proceeds
from
a
mouth
still
innocent
the
man
to
whom
it
is
addressed
ought
to
be
happy
for
desires
are
but
pain
and
torment
and
enjoyment
is
sweet
because
it
delivers
us
from
them
this
shews
that
those
who
prefer
a
little
resistance
to
an
easy
conquest
are
in
the
wrong
but
a
too
easy
conquest
often
points
to
a
depraved
nature
and
this
men
do
not
like
however
depraved
they
themselves
may
be
we
returned
to
the
house
and
i
gave
barberine
a
tender
kiss
before
laura
eyes
telling
her
that
she
had
a
very
jewel
in
her
daughter
a
compliment
which
made
her
face
light
up
with
pleasure
i
gave
the
dear
girl
ten
sequins
and
i
went
away
congratulating
myself
but
cursing
my
luck
at
not
being
able
to
make
as
good
provision
for
barberine
as
murray
had
made
for
her
sister
tonine
had
told
me
that
for
manners
sake
i
should
sup
once
with
her
i
went
the
same
evening
and
found
righelini
and
murray
there
the
supper
was
delicious
and
i
was
delighted
with
the
excellent
understanding
the
two
lovers
had
already
come
to
i
complimented
the
ambassador
on
the
loss
of
one
of
his
tastes
and
he
told
me
he
should
be
very
sorry
at
such
a
loss
as
it
would
warn
him
of
his
declining
powers
but
said
i
you
used
to
like
to
perform
the
mysterious
sacrifice
of
love
without
a
veil
it
was
not
i
but
ancilla
who
liked
it
and
as
i
preferred
pleasing
her
to
pleasing
myself
i
gave
in
to
her
taste
without
any
difficulty
i
am
delighted
with
your
answer
as
i
confess
it
would
cost
me
something
to
be
the
witness
of
your
exploits
with
tonine
having
casually
remarked
that
i
had
no
longer
a
house
in
muran
righelini
told
me
that
if
i
liked
he
could
get
me
a
delightful
house
at
a
low
rent
on
the
tondamente
nuovo
as
this
quarter
facing
north
and
as
agreeable
in
summer
as
disagreeable
in
winter
was
opposite
to
muran
where
i
should
have
to
go
twice
a
week
i
told
the
doctor
i
should
be
glad
to
look
at
the
house
i
took
leave
of
the
rich
and
fortunate
ambassador
at
midnight
and
before
passing
the
day
with
my
new
prize
i
went
to
sleep
so
as
to
be
fresh
and
capable
of
running
a
good
course
i
went
to
barberine
at
an
early
hour
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
said
my
mother
will
not
be
back
till
the
evening
and
my
brother
will
take
his
dinner
at
the
school
here
is
a
fowl
a
ham
some
cheese
and
two
bottles
of
scopolo
wine
we
will
take
our
mess
whenever
you
like
you
astonish
me
sweetheart
for
how
did
you
manage
to
get
such
a
good
dinner
we
owe
it
to
my
mother
so
to
her
be
the
praise
you
have
told
her
then
what
we
are
going
to
do
no
not
i
for
i
know
nothing
about
it
but
i
told
her
you
were
coming
to
see
me
and
at
the
same
time
i
gave
her
the
ten
sequins
and
what
did
your
mother
say
she
said
she
would
be
sorry
if
you
were
to
love
me
as
you
loved
my
sister
i
love
you
better
though
i
love
her
well
you
love
her
why
have
you
left
her
then
i
have
not
left
her
for
we
supped
together
yesterday
evening
but
we
no
longer
live
together
as
lovers
that
is
all
i
have
yielded
her
up
to
a
rich
friend
of
mine
who
has
made
her
fortune
that
is
well
though
i
do
understand
much
about
these
affairs
i
hope
you
will
tell
tonine
that
i
have
taken
her
place
and
i
should
be
very
pleased
if
you
would
let
her
know
that
you
are
quite
sure
you
are
my
first
lover
and
supposing
the
news
vexes
her
so
much
the
better
will
you
do
it
for
me
it
the
first
favour
i
have
asked
of
you
i
promise
to
do
so
after
this
rapid
dialogue
we
took
breakfast
and
then
perfectly
agreed
we
went
to
bed
rather
as
if
we
were
about
to
sacrifice
to
hymen
than
to
love
the
game
was
new
to
barberine
and
her
transports
her
green
notions
which
she
told
me
openly
her
inexperience
or
rather
her
awkwardness
enchanted
me
i
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
pluck
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
never
had
i
tasted
fruit
so
delicious
my
little
maid
would
have
been
ashamed
to
let
me
see
how
the
first
thorn
hurt
her
and
to
convince
me
that
she
only
smelt
the
rose
she
strove
to
make
me
think
she
experienced
more
pleasure
than
is
possible
in
a
first
trial
always
more
or
less
painful
she
was
not
yet
a
big
girl
the
roses
on
her
swelling
breasts
were
as
yet
but
buds
and
she
was
a
woman
only
in
her
heart
after
more
than
one
assault
delivered
and
sustained
with
spirit
we
got
up
for
dinner
and
after
we
had
refreshed
ourselves
we
mounted
once
more
the
altar
of
love
where
we
remained
till
the
evening
laura
found
us
dressed
and
well
pleased
with
each
other
on
her
return
i
made
barberine
another
present
of
twenty
sequins
i
swore
to
love
her
always
and
went
on
my
way
at
the
time
i
certainly
meant
to
keep
to
my
oath
but
that
which
destiny
had
in
store
for
me
could
not
be
reconciled
with
these
promises
which
welled
forth
from
my
soul
in
a
moment
of
excitement
the
next
morning
righelini
took
me
to
see
the
lodging
he
had
spoken
to
me
about
i
liked
it
and
took
it
on
the
spot
paying
the
first
quarter
in
advance
the
house
belonged
to
a
widow
with
two
daughters
the
elder
of
whom
had
just
been
blooded
righelini
was
her
doctor
and
had
treated
her
for
nine
months
without
success
as
he
was
going
to
pay
her
a
visit
i
went
in
with
him
and
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
fine
waxen
statue
surprise
drew
from
me
these
words
she
is
pretty
but
the
sculptor
should
give
her
some
colour
on
which
the
statue
smiled
in
a
manner
which
would
have
been
charming
if
her
lips
had
but
been
red
her
pallor
said
righelini
will
not
astonish
you
when
i
tell
you
she
has
just
been
blooded
for
the
hundred
and
fourth
time
i
gave
a
very
natural
gesture
of
surprise
this
fine
girl
had
attained
the
age
of
eighteen
years
without
experiencing
the
monthly
relief
afforded
by
nature
the
result
being
that
she
felt
a
deathly
faintness
three
or
four
times
a
week
and
the
only
relief
was
to
open
the
vein
i
want
to
send
her
to
the
country
said
the
doctor
where
pure
and
wholesome
air
and
above
all
more
exercise
will
do
her
more
good
than
all
the
drugs
in
the
world
after
i
had
been
told
that
my
bed
should
be
made
ready
by
the
evening
i
went
away
with
righelini
who
told
me
that
the
only
cure
for
the
girl
would
be
a
good
strong
lover
but
my
dear
doctor
said
i
ca
you
make
your
own
prescription
that
would
be
too
risky
a
game
for
i
might
find
myself
compelled
to
marry
her
and
i
hate
marriage
like
the
devil
though
i
was
no
better
inclined
towards
marriage
than
the
doctor
i
was
too
near
the
fire
not
to
get
burnt
and
the
reader
will
see
in
the
next
chapter
how
i
performed
the
miraculous
cure
of
bringing
the
colours
of
health
into
the
cheeks
of
this
pallid
beauty
chapter
xxv
the
fair
invalid
i
cure
her
a
plot
formed
to
ruin
me
what
happened
at
the
house
of
the
young
countess
bonafede
the
erberia
domiciliary
visit
my
conversation
with
de
bragadin
i
am
arrested
by
order
of
the
state
inquisitors
after
leaving
righelini
i
went
to
sup
with
de
bragadin
and
gave
the
generous
and
worthy
old
man
a
happy
evening
this
was
always
the
case
i
made
him
and
his
two
good
friends
happy
whenever
i
took
meals
with
them
leaving
them
at
an
early
hour
i
went
to
my
lodging
and
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
my
bedroom
balcony
occupied
a
young
lady
of
an
exquisite
figure
rose
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
and
gracefully
asked
me
pardon
for
the
liberty
she
had
taken
i
am
she
said
the
statue
you
saw
this
morning
we
do
not
light
the
candles
in
the
evening
for
fear
of
attracting
the
gnats
but
when
you
want
to
go
to
bed
we
will
shut
the
door
and
go
away
i
beg
to
introduce
you
to
my
younger
sister
my
mother
has
gone
to
bed
i
answered
her
to
the
effect
that
the
balcony
was
always
at
her
service
and
that
since
it
was
still
early
i
begged
their
permission
to
put
on
my
and
to
keep
them
company
her
conversation
was
charming
she
made
me
spend
two
most
delightful
hours
and
did
not
leave
me
till
twelve
her
younger
sister
lighted
me
a
candle
and
as
they
went
they
wished
me
a
good
night
i
lay
down
full
of
this
pretty
girl
and
i
could
not
believe
that
she
was
really
she
spoke
to
the
point
she
was
cheerful
clever
and
full
of
spirits
i
could
not
understand
how
it
came
to
pass
that
she
had
not
been
already
cured
in
a
town
like
venice
if
her
cure
was
really
only
to
be
effected
in
the
manner
described
by
righelini
for
in
spite
of
her
pallor
she
seemed
to
me
quite
fair
enough
to
charm
a
lover
and
i
believed
her
to
be
spirited
enough
to
determine
to
take
the
most
agreeable
medicine
a
doctor
can
prescribe
in
the
morning
i
rang
the
bell
as
i
was
getting
up
and
the
younger
sister
came
into
my
room
and
said
that
as
they
kept
no
servant
she
had
come
to
do
what
i
wanted
i
did
not
care
to
have
a
servant
when
i
was
not
at
de
bragadin
as
i
found
myself
more
at
liberty
to
do
what
i
liked
after
she
had
done
me
some
small
services
i
asked
her
how
her
sister
was
very
well
said
she
for
her
pale
complexion
is
not
an
illness
and
she
only
suffers
when
her
breath
fails
her
she
has
a
very
good
appetite
and
sleeps
as
well
as
i
do
whom
do
i
hear
playing
the
violin
it
the
dancing
master
giving
my
sister
a
lesson
i
hurried
over
my
dressing
that
i
might
see
her
and
i
found
her
charming
though
her
old
dancing
master
allowed
her
to
turn
in
her
toes
all
that
this
young
and
beautiful
girl
wanted
was
the
promethean
spark
the
colour
of
life
her
whiteness
was
too
like
snow
and
was
distressing
to
look
at
the
dancing
master
begged
me
to
dance
a
minuet
with
his
pupil
and
i
assented
asking
him
to
play
larghissimo
the
signorina
would
find
it
too
tiring
said
he
but
she
hastened
to
answer
that
she
did
not
feel
weak
and
would
like
to
dance
thus
she
danced
very
well
but
when
we
had
done
she
was
obliged
to
throw
herself
in
a
chair
in
future
my
dear
master
said
she
i
will
only
dance
like
that
for
i
think
the
rapid
motion
will
do
me
good
when
the
master
was
gone
i
told
her
that
her
lessons
were
too
short
and
that
her
master
was
letting
her
get
into
bad
habits
i
then
set
her
feet
her
shoulders
and
her
arms
in
the
proper
manner
i
taught
her
how
to
give
her
hand
gracefully
to
bend
her
knees
in
time
in
fine
i
gave
her
a
regular
lesson
for
an
hour
and
seeing
that
she
was
getting
rather
tired
i
begged
her
to
sit
down
and
i
went
out
to
pay
a
visit
to
i
found
her
very
sad
for
c
c
father
was
dead
and
they
had
taken
her
out
of
the
convent
to
marry
her
to
a
lawyer
before
leaving
c
c
had
left
a
letter
for
me
in
which
she
said
that
if
i
would
promise
to
marry
her
at
some
time
suitable
to
myself
she
would
wait
for
me
and
refuse
all
other
offers
i
answered
her
straightforwardly
that
i
had
no
property
and
no
prospects
that
i
left
her
free
advising
her
not
to
refuse
any
offer
which
might
be
to
her
advantage
in
spite
of
this
dismissal
c
c
did
not
marry
n
till
after
my
flight
from
the
leads
when
nobody
expected
to
see
me
again
in
venice
i
did
not
see
her
for
nineteen
years
and
then
i
was
grieved
to
find
her
a
widow
and
poorly
off
if
i
went
to
venice
now
i
should
not
marry
her
for
at
my
age
marriage
is
an
absurdity
but
i
would
share
with
her
my
little
all
and
live
with
her
as
with
a
dear
sister
when
i
hear
women
talking
about
the
bad
faith
and
inconstancy
of
men
and
maintaining
that
when
men
make
promises
of
eternal
constancy
they
are
always
deceivers
i
confess
that
they
are
right
and
join
in
their
complaints
still
it
can
not
be
helped
for
the
promises
of
lovers
are
dictated
by
the
heart
and
consequently
the
lamentations
of
women
only
make
me
want
to
laugh
alas
we
love
without
heeding
reason
and
cease
to
love
in
the
same
manner
about
this
time
i
received
a
letter
from
the
abbe
de
bernis
who
wrote
also
to
m
m
he
told
me
that
i
ought
to
do
my
utmost
to
make
our
nun
take
a
reasonable
view
of
things
dwelling
on
the
risks
i
should
run
in
carrying
her
off
and
bringing
her
to
paris
where
all
his
influence
would
be
of
no
avail
to
obtain
for
us
that
safety
so
indispensable
to
happiness
i
saw
m
m
we
shewed
each
other
our
letters
she
had
some
bitter
tears
and
her
grief
pierced
me
to
the
heart
i
still
had
a
great
love
for
her
in
spite
of
my
daily
infidelities
and
when
i
thought
of
those
moments
in
which
i
had
seen
her
given
over
to
voluptuousness
i
could
not
help
pitying
her
fate
as
i
thought
of
the
days
of
despair
in
store
for
her
but
soon
after
this
an
event
happened
which
gave
rise
to
some
wholesome
reflections
one
day
when
i
had
come
to
see
her
she
said
they
have
just
been
burying
a
nun
who
died
of
consumption
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
she
was
called
concetta
she
knew
you
and
told
c
c
your
name
when
you
used
to
come
to
mass
on
feast
days
c
c
begged
her
to
be
discreet
but
the
nun
told
her
that
you
were
a
dangerous
man
whose
presence
should
be
shunned
by
a
young
girl
c
c
told
me
all
this
after
the
mask
of
pierrot
what
was
this
saint
name
when
she
was
in
the
world
martha
i
know
her
i
then
told
m
m
the
whole
history
of
my
loves
with
nanette
and
marton
ending
with
the
letter
she
wrote
me
in
which
she
said
that
she
owed
me
indirectly
that
eternal
salvation
to
which
she
hoped
to
attain
in
eight
or
ten
days
my
conversation
with
my
daughter
conversation
which
took
place
on
the
balcony
and
which
generally
lasted
till
midnight
and
the
lesson
i
gave
her
every
morning
produced
the
inevitable
and
natural
results
firstly
that
she
no
longer
complained
of
her
breath
failing
and
secondly
that
i
fell
in
love
with
her
nature
cure
had
not
yet
relieved
her
but
she
no
longer
needed
to
be
let
blood
righelini
came
to
visit
her
as
usual
and
seeing
that
she
was
better
he
prophesied
that
nature
remedy
without
which
only
art
could
keep
her
alive
would
make
all
right
before
the
autumn
her
mother
looked
upon
me
as
an
angel
sent
by
god
to
cure
her
daughter
who
for
her
part
shewed
me
that
gratitude
which
with
women
is
the
first
step
towards
love
i
had
made
her
dismiss
her
old
dancing
master
and
i
had
taught
her
to
dance
with
extreme
grace
at
the
end
of
these
ten
or
twelve
days
just
as
i
was
going
to
give
her
her
lesson
her
breath
failed
instantaneously
and
she
fell
back
into
my
arms
like
a
dead
woman
i
was
alarmed
but
her
mother
who
had
become
accustomed
to
see
her
thus
sent
for
the
surgeon
and
her
sister
unlaced
her
i
was
enchanted
with
her
exquisite
bosom
which
needed
no
colouring
to
make
it
more
beautiful
i
covered
it
up
saying
that
the
surgeon
would
make
a
false
stroke
if
he
were
to
see
her
thus
uncovered
but
feeling
that
i
laid
my
hand
upon
her
with
delight
she
gently
repulsed
me
looking
at
me
with
a
languishing
gaze
which
made
the
deepest
impression
on
me
the
surgeon
came
and
bled
her
in
the
arm
and
almost
instantaneously
she
recovered
full
consciousness
at
most
only
four
ounces
of
blood
were
taken
from
her
and
her
mother
telling
me
that
this
was
the
utmost
extent
to
which
she
was
blooded
i
saw
it
was
no
such
matter
for
wonder
as
righelini
represented
it
for
being
blooded
twice
a
week
she
lost
three
pounds
of
blood
a
month
which
she
would
have
done
naturally
if
the
vessels
had
not
been
obstructed
the
surgeon
had
hardly
gone
out
of
the
door
when
to
my
astonishment
she
told
me
that
if
i
would
wait
for
her
a
moment
she
would
come
back
and
begin
her
dancing
this
she
did
and
danced
as
if
there
had
been
nothing
the
matter
her
bosom
on
which
two
of
my
senses
were
qualified
to
give
evidence
was
the
last
stroke
and
made
me
madly
in
love
with
her
i
returned
to
the
house
in
the
evening
and
found
her
in
her
room
with
the
sister
she
told
me
that
she
was
expecting
her
who
was
an
intimate
friend
of
her
father
and
had
come
every
evening
to
spend
an
hour
with
her
for
the
last
eighteen
years
how
old
is
he
he
is
over
fifty
is
he
a
married
man
yes
his
name
is
count
s
he
is
as
fond
of
me
as
a
father
would
be
and
his
affection
has
continued
the
same
since
my
childhood
even
his
wife
comes
to
see
me
sometimes
and
to
ask
me
to
dinner
neat
autumn
i
am
going
into
the
country
with
her
and
i
hope
the
fresh
air
will
do
me
good
my
knows
you
are
staying
with
us
and
is
satisfied
he
does
not
know
you
but
if
you
like
you
can
make
his
acquaintance
i
was
glad
to
hear
all
this
as
i
gained
a
good
deal
of
useful
information
without
having
to
ask
any
awkward
questions
the
friendship
of
this
greek
looked
very
like
love
he
was
the
husband
of
countess
s
who
had
taken
me
to
the
convent
at
muran
two
years
before
i
found
the
count
a
very
polite
man
he
thanked
me
in
a
paternal
manner
for
my
kindness
to
his
daughter
and
begged
me
to
do
him
the
honour
of
dining
with
him
on
the
following
day
telling
me
that
he
would
introduce
me
to
his
wife
i
accepted
his
invitation
with
pleasure
for
i
was
fond
of
dramatic
situations
and
my
meeting
with
the
countess
promised
to
be
an
exciting
one
this
invitation
bespoke
the
courteous
gentleman
and
i
charmed
my
pretty
pupil
by
singing
his
praises
after
he
had
gone
my
said
she
is
in
possession
of
all
the
necessary
documents
for
withdrawing
from
the
house
of
persico
our
family
fortune
which
amounts
to
forty
thousand
crowns
a
quarter
of
this
sum
belongs
to
me
and
my
mother
has
promised
my
sister
and
myself
to
share
her
dowry
between
us
i
concluded
from
this
that
she
would
bring
her
husband
fifteen
thousand
venetian
ducats
i
guessed
that
she
was
appealing
to
me
with
her
fortune
and
wished
to
make
me
in
love
with
her
by
shewing
herself
chary
of
her
favours
for
whenever
i
allowed
myself
any
small
liberties
she
checked
me
with
words
of
remonstrance
to
which
i
could
find
no
answer
i
determined
to
make
her
pursue
another
course
next
day
i
took
her
with
me
to
her
without
telling
her
that
i
knew
the
countess
i
fancied
the
lady
would
pretend
not
to
know
me
but
i
was
wrong
as
she
welcomed
me
in
the
handsomest
manner
as
if
i
were
an
old
friend
this
no
doubt
was
a
surprise
for
the
count
but
he
was
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
to
shew
any
astonishment
he
asked
her
when
she
had
made
my
acquaintance
and
she
like
a
woman
of
experience
answered
without
the
slightest
hesitation
that
we
had
seen
each
other
two
years
ago
at
mira
the
matter
was
settled
and
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
day
towards
evening
i
took
the
young
lady
in
my
gondola
back
to
the
house
but
wishing
to
shorten
the
journey
i
allowed
myself
to
indulge
in
a
few
caresses
i
was
hurt
at
being
responded
to
by
reproaches
and
for
that
reason
as
soon
as
she
had
set
foot
on
her
own
doorstep
instead
of
getting
out
i
went
to
tonine
house
and
spent
nearly
the
whole
night
there
with
the
ambassador
who
came
a
little
after
me
next
day
as
i
did
not
get
up
till
quite
late
there
was
no
dancing
lesson
and
when
i
excused
myself
she
told
me
not
to
trouble
any
more
about
it
in
the
evening
i
sat
on
the
balcony
far
into
the
night
but
she
did
not
come
vexed
at
this
air
of
indifference
i
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
went
out
not
returning
till
nightfall
she
was
on
the
balcony
but
as
she
kept
me
at
a
respectful
distance
i
only
talked
to
her
on
commonplace
subjects
in
the
morning
i
was
roused
by
a
tremendous
noise
i
got
up
and
hurriedly
putting
on
my
ran
into
her
room
to
see
what
was
the
matter
only
to
find
her
dying
i
had
no
need
to
feign
an
interest
in
her
for
i
felt
the
most
tender
concern
as
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
july
it
was
extremely
hot
and
my
fair
invalid
was
only
covered
by
a
thin
sheet
she
could
only
speak
to
me
with
her
eyes
but
though
the
lids
were
lowered
she
looked
upon
me
so
lovingly
i
asked
her
if
she
suffered
from
palpitations
and
laying
my
hand
upon
her
heart
i
pressed
a
fiery
kiss
upon
her
breast
this
was
the
electric
spark
for
she
gave
a
sigh
which
did
her
good
she
had
not
strength
to
repulse
the
hand
which
i
pressed
amorously
upon
her
heart
and
becoming
bolder
i
fastened
my
burning
lips
upon
her
languid
mouth
i
warmed
her
with
my
breath
and
my
audacious
hand
penetrated
to
the
very
sanctuary
of
bliss
she
made
an
effort
to
push
me
back
and
told
me
with
her
eyes
since
she
could
not
speak
how
insulted
she
felt
i
drew
back
my
hand
and
at
that
moment
the
surgeon
came
hardly
was
the
vein
opened
when
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
by
the
time
the
operation
was
over
she
wished
to
get
up
i
entreated
her
to
stay
in
bed
and
her
mother
added
her
voice
to
mine
at
last
i
persuaded
her
telling
her
that
i
would
not
leave
her
for
a
second
and
that
i
would
have
my
dinner
by
her
bedside
she
then
put
on
a
corset
and
asked
her
sister
to
draw
a
sarcenet
coverlet
over
her
as
her
limbs
could
be
seen
as
plainly
as
through
a
crape
veil
having
given
orders
for
my
dinner
i
sat
down
by
her
bedside
burning
with
love
and
taking
her
hand
and
covering
it
with
kisses
i
told
her
that
i
was
sure
she
would
get
better
if
she
would
let
herself
love
alas
she
said
whom
shall
i
love
not
knowing
whether
i
shall
be
loved
in
return
i
did
not
leave
this
question
unanswered
and
continuing
the
amorous
discourse
with
animation
i
won
a
sigh
and
a
lovelorn
glance
i
put
my
hand
on
her
knee
begging
her
to
let
me
leave
it
there
and
promising
to
go
no
farther
but
little
by
little
i
attained
the
center
and
strove
to
give
her
some
pleasant
sensations
let
me
alone
said
she
in
a
sentimental
voice
drawing
away
is
perchance
the
cause
of
my
illness
no
sweetheart
i
replied
that
can
not
be
and
my
mouth
stopped
all
her
objections
upon
her
lips
i
was
enchanted
for
i
was
now
in
a
fair
way
and
i
saw
the
moment
of
bliss
in
the
distance
feeling
certain
that
i
could
effect
a
cure
if
the
doctor
was
not
mistaken
i
spared
her
all
indiscreet
questions
out
of
regard
for
her
modesty
but
i
declared
myself
her
lover
promising
to
ask
nothing
of
her
but
what
was
necessary
to
feed
the
fire
of
my
love
they
sent
me
up
a
very
good
dinner
and
she
did
justice
to
it
afterwards
saying
that
she
was
quite
well
she
got
up
and
i
went
away
to
dress
myself
for
going
out
i
came
back
early
in
the
evening
and
found
her
on
my
balcony
there
as
i
sat
close
to
her
looking
into
her
face
speaking
by
turns
the
language
of
the
eyes
and
that
of
sighs
fixing
my
amorous
gaze
upon
those
charms
which
the
moonlight
rendered
sweeter
i
made
her
share
in
the
fire
which
consumed
me
and
as
i
pressed
her
amorously
to
my
bosom
she
completed
my
bliss
with
such
warmth
that
i
could
easily
see
that
she
thought
she
was
receiving
a
favour
and
not
granting
one
i
sacrificed
the
victim
without
staining
the
altar
with
blood
her
sister
came
to
tell
her
that
it
grew
late
do
you
go
to
bed
she
answered
the
fresh
air
is
doing
me
good
and
i
want
to
enjoy
it
a
little
longer
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
we
went
to
bed
together
as
if
we
had
been
doing
it
for
a
whole
year
and
we
passed
a
glorious
night
i
full
of
love
and
the
desire
of
curing
her
and
she
of
tender
and
ardent
voluptuousness
at
she
embraced
me
her
eyes
dewy
with
bliss
and
went
to
lie
down
in
her
own
bed
i
like
her
stood
in
need
of
a
rest
and
on
that
day
there
was
no
talk
of
a
dancing
lesson
in
spite
of
the
fierce
pleasure
of
enjoyment
and
the
transports
of
this
delightful
girl
i
did
not
for
a
moment
lay
prudence
aside
we
continued
to
pass
such
nights
as
these
for
three
weeks
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
thoroughly
cured
i
should
doubtless
have
married
her
if
an
event
had
not
happened
to
me
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
which
i
shall
speak
lower
down
you
will
remember
dear
reader
about
a
romance
by
the
abbe
chiari
a
satirical
romance
which
murray
had
given
me
and
in
which
i
fared
badly
enough
at
the
author
hands
i
had
small
reason
to
be
pleased
with
him
and
i
let
him
know
my
opinion
in
such
wise
that
the
abbe
who
dreaded
a
caning
kept
upon
his
guard
about
the
same
time
i
received
an
anonymous
letter
the
writer
of
which
told
me
that
i
should
be
better
occupied
in
taking
care
of
myself
than
in
thoughts
of
chastising
the
abbe
for
i
was
threatened
by
an
imminent
danger
anonymous
should
be
held
in
contempt
but
one
ought
to
know
how
on
occasion
to
make
the
best
of
advice
given
in
that
way
i
did
nothing
and
made
a
great
mistake
about
the
same
time
a
man
named
manuzzi
a
stone
setter
for
his
first
trade
and
also
a
spy
a
vile
agent
of
the
state
inquisitors
a
man
of
whom
i
knew
nothing
found
a
way
to
make
my
acquaintance
by
offering
to
let
me
have
diamonds
on
credit
and
by
this
means
he
got
the
entry
of
my
house
as
he
was
looking
at
some
books
scattered
here
and
there
about
the
room
he
stopped
short
at
the
manuscripts
which
were
on
magic
enjoying
foolishly
enough
his
look
of
astonishment
i
shewed
him
the
books
which
teach
one
how
to
summon
the
elementary
spirits
my
readers
will
i
hope
do
me
the
favour
to
believe
that
i
put
no
faith
in
these
conjuring
books
but
i
had
them
by
me
and
used
to
amuse
myself
with
them
as
one
does
amuse
one
self
with
the
multitudinous
follies
which
proceed
from
the
heads
of
visionaries
a
few
days
after
the
traitor
came
to
see
me
and
told
me
that
a
collector
whose
name
he
might
not
tell
me
was
ready
to
give
me
a
thousand
sequins
for
my
five
books
but
that
he
would
like
to
examine
them
first
to
see
if
they
were
genuine
as
he
promised
to
let
me
have
them
back
in
hours
and
not
thinking
much
about
the
matter
i
let
him
have
them
he
did
not
fail
to
bring
them
back
the
next
day
telling
me
that
the
collector
thought
them
forgeries
i
found
out
some
years
after
that
he
had
taken
them
to
the
state
inquisitors
who
thus
discovered
that
i
was
a
notable
magician
everything
that
happened
throughout
this
fatal
month
tended
to
my
ruin
for
madame
memmo
mother
of
andre
bernard
and
laurent
memmo
had
taken
it
into
her
head
that
i
had
inclined
her
sons
to
atheistic
opinions
and
took
counsel
with
the
old
knight
antony
mocenigo
de
bragadin
uncle
who
was
angry
with
me
because
as
he
said
i
had
conspired
to
seduce
his
nephew
the
matter
was
a
serious
one
and
an
was
very
possible
as
it
came
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
holy
office
a
kind
of
wild
beast
with
which
it
is
not
good
to
quarrel
nevertheless
as
there
would
be
some
difficulty
in
shutting
me
up
in
the
ecclesiastical
prisons
of
the
holy
office
it
was
determined
to
carry
my
case
before
the
state
inquisitors
who
took
upon
themselves
the
provisional
duty
of
putting
a
watch
upon
my
manner
of
living
antony
condulmer
who
as
a
friend
of
abbe
chiari
was
an
enemy
of
mine
was
then
an
inquisitor
of
state
and
he
took
the
opportunity
of
looking
upon
me
in
the
light
of
a
disturber
of
the
peace
of
the
commonwealth
a
secretary
of
an
embassy
whom
i
knew
some
years
after
told
me
that
a
paid
informer
with
two
other
witnesses
also
doubtless
in
the
pay
of
this
grand
tribunal
had
declared
that
i
was
guilty
of
only
believing
in
the
devil
as
if
this
absurd
belief
if
it
were
possible
did
not
necessarily
connote
a
belief
in
god
these
three
honest
fellows
testified
with
an
oath
that
when
i
lost
money
at
play
on
which
occasion
all
the
faithful
are
wont
to
blaspheme
i
was
never
heard
to
curse
the
devil
i
was
further
accused
of
eating
meat
all
the
year
round
of
only
going
to
hear
fine
masses
and
i
was
vehemently
suspected
of
being
a
freemason
it
was
added
that
i
frequented
the
society
of
foreign
ministers
and
that
living
as
i
did
with
three
noblemen
it
was
certain
that
i
revealed
for
the
large
sums
which
i
was
seen
to
lose
as
many
state
secrets
as
i
could
worm
out
of
them
all
these
accusations
none
of
which
had
any
foundation
in
fact
served
the
tribunal
as
a
pretext
to
treat
me
as
an
enemy
of
the
commonwealth
and
as
a
prime
conspirator
for
several
weeks
i
was
counselled
by
persons
whom
i
might
have
trusted
to
go
abroad
whilst
the
tribunal
was
engaged
on
my
case
this
should
have
been
enough
for
the
only
people
who
can
live
in
peace
at
venice
are
those
whose
existence
the
tribunal
is
ignorant
of
but
i
obstinately
despised
all
these
hints
if
i
had
listened
to
the
indirect
advice
which
was
given
me
i
should
have
become
anxious
and
i
was
the
sworn
foe
of
all
anxiety
i
kept
saying
to
myself
i
feel
remorse
for
nothing
and
i
am
therefore
guilty
of
nothing
and
the
innocent
have
nothing
to
fear
i
was
a
fool
for
i
argued
as
if
i
had
been
a
free
man
in
a
free
country
i
must
also
confess
that
what
to
a
great
extent
kept
me
from
thinking
of
possible
misfortune
was
the
actual
misfortune
which
oppressed
me
from
morning
to
night
i
lost
every
day
i
owed
money
everywhere
i
had
pawned
all
my
jewels
and
even
my
portrait
cases
taking
the
precaution
however
of
removing
the
portraits
which
with
my
important
papers
and
my
amorous
letters
i
had
placed
in
the
hands
of
madame
manzoni
i
found
myself
avoided
in
society
an
old
senator
told
me
one
day
that
it
was
known
that
the
young
countess
bonafede
had
become
mad
in
consequence
of
the
love
philtres
i
had
given
her
she
was
still
at
the
asylum
and
in
her
moments
of
delirium
she
did
nothing
but
utter
my
name
with
curses
i
must
let
my
readers
into
the
secret
of
this
small
history
this
young
countess
bonafede
to
whom
i
had
given
some
sequins
a
few
days
after
my
return
to
venice
thought
herself
capable
of
making
me
continue
my
visits
from
which
she
had
profited
largely
worried
by
her
letters
i
went
to
see
her
several
times
and
always
left
her
a
few
sequins
but
with
the
exception
of
my
first
visit
i
was
never
polite
enough
to
give
her
any
proofs
of
my
affection
my
coldness
had
baulked
all
her
endeavours
for
a
year
when
she
played
a
criminal
part
of
which
though
i
was
never
able
absolutely
to
convict
her
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
her
guilty
she
wrote
me
a
letter
in
which
she
importuned
me
to
come
and
see
her
at
a
certain
hour
on
important
business
my
curiosity
as
well
as
a
desire
to
be
of
service
to
her
took
me
there
at
the
appointed
time
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
told
me
that
the
important
business
was
love
this
made
me
laugh
heartily
and
i
was
pleased
to
find
her
looking
neater
than
usual
which
doubtless
made
me
find
her
looking
prettier
she
reminded
me
of
andre
and
succeeded
so
well
in
her
efforts
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
satisfying
her
desires
i
took
off
my
cloak
and
asked
her
if
her
father
were
in
she
told
me
he
had
gone
out
being
obliged
to
go
out
for
a
minute
in
coming
back
i
mistook
the
door
and
i
found
myself
in
the
next
room
where
i
was
much
astonished
to
see
the
count
and
two
fellows
with
him
my
dear
count
i
said
your
daughter
has
just
told
me
that
you
were
out
i
myself
told
her
to
do
so
as
i
have
some
business
with
these
gentlemen
which
however
can
wait
for
another
day
i
would
have
gone
but
he
stopped
me
and
having
dismissed
the
two
men
he
told
me
that
he
was
delighted
to
see
me
and
forthwith
began
the
tale
of
his
troubles
which
were
of
more
than
one
kind
the
state
inquisitors
had
stopped
his
slender
pension
and
he
was
on
the
eve
of
seeing
himself
driven
out
with
his
family
into
the
streets
to
beg
his
bread
he
said
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
pay
his
landlord
anything
for
three
years
but
if
he
could
pay
only
a
quarter
rent
he
would
obtain
a
respite
or
if
he
persisted
in
turning
him
out
he
could
make
a
of
it
and
take
up
his
abode
somewhere
else
as
he
only
wanted
twenty
ducats
i
took
out
six
sequins
and
gave
them
to
him
he
embraced
me
and
shed
tears
of
joy
then
taking
his
poor
cloak
he
called
his
daughter
told
her
to
keep
me
company
and
went
out
alone
with
the
countess
i
examined
the
door
of
communication
between
the
two
rooms
and
found
it
slightly
open
your
father
i
said
would
have
surprised
me
and
it
is
easy
to
guess
what
he
would
have
done
with
the
two
sbirri
who
were
with
him
the
plot
is
clear
and
i
have
only
escaped
from
it
by
the
happiest
of
chances
she
denied
wept
called
god
to
witness
threw
herself
on
her
knees
but
i
turned
my
head
away
and
taking
my
cloak
went
away
without
a
word
she
kept
on
writing
to
me
but
her
letters
remained
unanswered
and
i
saw
her
no
more
it
was
and
between
the
heat
her
passions
hunger
and
wretchedness
her
head
was
turned
and
she
became
so
mad
that
she
went
out
of
the
house
stark
naked
and
ran
up
and
down
peter
place
asking
those
who
stopped
her
to
take
her
to
my
house
this
sad
story
went
all
over
the
town
and
caused
me
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
the
poor
wretch
was
sent
to
an
asylum
and
did
not
recover
her
reason
for
five
years
when
she
came
out
she
found
herself
reduced
to
beg
her
bread
in
the
streets
like
all
her
brothers
except
one
whom
i
found
a
cadet
in
the
guards
of
the
king
of
spain
twelve
years
afterwards
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
all
this
had
happened
a
year
ago
but
the
story
was
dug
up
against
me
and
dressed
out
in
the
attire
of
fiction
and
thus
formed
part
of
those
clouds
which
were
to
discharge
their
thunder
upon
me
to
my
destruction
in
the
july
of
the
hateful
court
gave
instructions
to
secure
me
alive
or
dead
in
this
furious
style
all
orders
for
arrests
proceeding
from
the
three
were
issued
for
the
least
of
their
commands
carried
with
it
the
penalty
of
death
three
or
four
days
before
the
feast
of
james
my
patron
saint
m
m
made
me
a
present
of
several
ells
of
silver
lace
to
trim
a
sarcenet
dress
which
i
was
going
to
wear
on
the
eve
of
the
feast
i
went
to
see
her
dressed
in
my
fine
suit
and
i
told
her
that
i
should
come
again
on
the
day
following
to
ask
her
to
lend
me
some
money
as
i
did
not
know
where
to
turn
to
find
some
she
was
still
in
possession
of
the
five
hundred
sequins
which
she
had
put
aside
when
i
had
sold
her
diamonds
as
i
was
sure
of
getting
the
money
in
the
morning
i
passed
the
night
at
play
and
i
lost
the
five
hundred
sequins
in
advance
at
being
in
need
of
a
little
quiet
i
went
to
the
erberia
a
space
of
ground
on
the
quay
of
the
grand
canal
here
is
held
the
herb
fruit
and
flower
market
people
in
good
society
who
come
to
walk
in
the
erberia
at
a
rather
early
hour
usually
say
that
they
come
to
see
the
hundreds
of
boats
laden
with
vegetables
fruit
and
flowers
which
hail
from
the
numerous
islands
near
the
town
but
everyone
knows
that
they
are
men
and
women
who
have
been
spending
the
night
in
the
excesses
of
venus
or
bacchus
or
who
have
lost
all
hope
at
the
and
come
here
to
breath
a
purer
air
and
to
calm
their
minds
the
fashion
of
walking
in
this
place
shews
how
the
character
of
a
nation
changes
the
venetians
of
old
time
who
made
as
great
a
mystery
of
love
as
of
state
affairs
have
been
replaced
by
the
modern
venetians
whose
most
prominent
characteristic
is
to
make
a
mystery
of
nothing
those
who
come
to
the
erberia
with
women
wish
to
excite
the
envy
of
their
friends
by
thus
publishing
their
good
fortune
those
who
come
alone
are
on
the
watch
for
discoveries
or
on
the
for
materials
to
make
wives
or
husbands
jealous
the
women
only
come
to
be
seen
glad
to
let
everybody
know
that
they
are
without
any
restraint
upon
their
actions
there
was
certainly
no
question
of
smartness
there
considering
the
disordered
style
of
dress
worn
the
women
seemed
to
have
agreed
to
shew
all
the
signs
of
disorder
imaginable
to
give
those
who
saw
them
something
to
talk
about
as
for
the
men
on
whose
arms
they
leaned
their
careless
and
lounging
airs
were
intended
to
give
the
idea
of
a
surfeit
of
pleasure
and
to
make
one
think
that
the
disordered
appearance
of
their
companions
was
a
sure
triumph
they
had
enjoyed
in
short
it
was
the
correct
thing
to
look
tired
out
and
as
if
one
stood
in
need
of
sleep
this
veracious
description
reader
will
not
give
you
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
morals
of
my
dear
fellow
citizens
but
what
object
should
i
have
at
my
age
for
deceiving
venice
is
not
at
the
world
end
but
is
well
enough
known
to
those
whose
curiosity
brings
them
into
italy
and
everyone
can
see
for
himself
if
my
pictures
are
overdrawn
after
walking
up
and
down
for
half
an
hour
i
came
away
and
thinking
the
whole
house
still
i
drew
my
key
out
to
open
the
door
but
what
was
my
astonishment
to
find
it
useless
as
the
door
was
open
and
what
is
more
the
lock
burst
off
i
ran
upstairs
and
found
them
all
up
and
my
landlady
uttering
bitter
lamentations
she
told
me
has
entered
my
house
forcibly
accompanied
by
a
band
of
sbirri
he
turned
everything
upside
down
on
the
pretext
that
he
was
in
search
of
a
portmanteau
full
of
salt
a
highly
contraband
article
he
said
he
knew
that
a
portmanteau
had
been
landed
there
the
evening
before
which
was
quite
true
but
it
belonged
to
count
s
and
only
contained
linen
and
clothes
after
inspecting
it
went
out
without
saying
a
word
he
had
also
paid
my
room
a
visit
she
told
me
that
she
must
have
some
reparation
made
her
and
thinking
she
was
in
the
right
i
promised
to
speak
to
de
bragadin
on
the
matter
the
same
day
needing
rest
above
all
things
i
lay
down
but
my
nervous
excitement
which
i
attributed
to
my
heavy
losses
at
play
made
me
rise
after
three
or
four
hours
and
i
went
to
see
de
bragadin
to
whom
i
told
the
whole
story
begging
him
to
press
for
some
signal
amends
i
made
a
lively
representation
to
him
of
all
the
grounds
on
which
my
landlady
required
proportionate
amends
to
be
made
since
the
laws
guaranteed
the
peace
of
all
people
i
saw
that
the
three
friends
were
greatly
saddened
by
what
i
said
and
the
wise
old
man
quietly
but
sadly
told
me
that
i
should
have
my
answer
after
dinner
de
la
haye
dined
with
us
but
all
through
the
meal
which
was
a
melancholy
one
he
spoke
not
a
word
his
silence
should
have
told
me
all
if
i
had
not
been
under
the
influence
of
some
malevolent
genii
who
would
not
allow
me
to
exercise
my
common
sense
as
to
the
sorrow
of
my
three
friends
i
put
that
down
to
their
friendship
for
me
my
connection
with
these
worthy
men
had
always
been
the
talk
of
the
town
and
as
all
were
agreed
that
it
could
not
be
explained
on
natural
grounds
it
was
deemed
to
be
the
effect
of
some
sorcery
exercised
by
me
these
three
men
were
thoroughly
religious
and
virtuous
citizens
i
was
nothing
if
not
irreligious
and
venice
did
not
contain
a
greater
libertine
virtue
it
was
said
may
have
compassion
on
vice
but
can
not
become
its
friend
after
dinner
de
bragadin
took
me
into
his
closet
with
his
two
friends
from
whom
he
had
no
secrets
he
told
me
with
wonderful
calmness
that
instead
of
meditating
vengeance
on
i
should
be
thinking
of
putting
myself
in
a
place
of
safety
the
portmanteau
said
he
was
a
mere
pretext
it
was
you
they
wanted
and
thought
to
find
since
your
good
genius
has
made
them
miss
you
look
out
for
yourself
perhaps
by
it
may
be
too
late
i
have
been
a
state
inquisitor
for
eight
months
and
i
know
the
way
in
which
the
arrests
ordered
by
the
court
are
carried
out
they
would
not
break
open
a
door
to
look
for
a
box
of
salt
indeed
it
is
possible
that
they
knew
you
were
out
and
sought
to
warn
you
to
escape
in
this
manner
take
my
advice
my
dear
son
and
set
out
directly
for
fusina
and
thence
as
quickly
as
you
can
make
your
way
to
florence
where
you
can
remain
till
i
write
to
you
that
you
may
return
with
safety
if
you
have
no
money
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
sequins
for
present
expenses
believe
me
that
prudence
bids
you
go
blinded
by
my
folly
i
answered
him
that
being
guilty
of
nothing
i
had
nothing
to
fear
and
that
consequently
although
i
knew
his
advice
was
good
i
could
not
follow
it
the
high
court
said
he
may
deem
you
guilty
of
crimes
real
or
imaginary
but
in
any
case
it
will
give
you
no
account
of
the
accusations
against
you
ask
your
oracle
if
you
shall
follow
my
advice
or
not
i
refused
because
i
knew
the
folly
of
such
a
proceeding
but
by
way
of
excuse
i
said
that
i
only
consulted
it
when
i
was
in
doubt
finally
i
reasoned
that
if
i
fled
i
should
be
shewing
fear
and
thus
confessing
my
guilt
for
an
innocent
man
feeling
no
remorse
can
not
reasonably
be
afraid
of
anything
if
secrecy
said
i
is
of
the
essence
of
the
court
you
can
not
possibly
judge
after
my
escape
whether
i
have
done
so
rightly
or
wrongly
the
same
reasons
which
according
to
your
excellence
bid
me
go
would
forbid
my
return
must
i
then
say
for
ever
to
my
country
and
all
that
is
dear
to
me
as
a
last
resource
he
tried
to
persuade
me
to
pass
the
following
day
and
night
at
least
at
the
palace
i
am
still
ashamed
of
having
refused
the
worthy
old
man
to
whom
i
owed
so
much
this
favour
for
the
palace
of
a
noble
is
sacred
to
the
police
who
dare
not
cross
its
threshold
without
a
special
order
from
the
tribunal
which
is
practically
never
given
by
yielding
to
his
request
i
should
have
avoided
a
grievous
misfortune
and
spared
the
worthy
old
man
some
acute
grief
i
was
moved
to
see
de
bragadin
weeping
and
perhaps
i
might
have
granted
to
his
tears
that
which
i
had
obstinately
refused
to
his
arguments
and
entreaties
for
heaven
sake
said
i
spare
me
the
harrowing
sight
of
your
tears
in
an
instant
he
summoned
all
his
strength
to
his
assistance
made
some
indifferent
remarks
and
then
with
a
smile
full
of
good
nature
he
embraced
me
saying
perhaps
i
may
be
fated
never
to
see
you
again
but
viam
invenient
i
embraced
him
affectionately
and
went
away
but
his
prediction
was
verified
for
i
never
saw
him
again
he
died
eleven
years
afterwards
i
found
myself
in
the
street
without
feeling
the
slightest
fear
but
i
was
in
a
good
deal
of
trouble
about
my
debts
i
had
not
the
heart
to
go
to
muran
to
take
away
from
her
last
five
hundred
sequins
which
sum
i
owed
to
the
man
who
won
it
from
me
in
the
night
i
preferred
asking
him
to
wait
eight
days
and
i
did
so
after
performing
this
unpleasant
piece
of
business
i
returned
home
and
having
consoled
my
landlady
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
i
kissed
the
daughter
and
lay
down
to
sleep
the
date
was
july
next
morning
at
who
should
enter
my
room
but
the
awful
to
awake
to
see
him
and
to
hear
him
asking
if
i
were
jacques
casanova
was
the
work
of
a
moment
at
my
yes
i
am
casanova
he
told
me
to
rise
to
put
on
my
clothes
to
give
him
all
the
papers
and
manuscripts
in
my
possession
and
to
follow
him
on
whose
authority
do
you
order
me
to
do
this
by
the
authority
of
the
tribunal
