and
away
away
ever
so
far
away
near
the
western
shores
of
the
ocean
of
peace
lie
the
happy
islands
the
paradise
of
children
some
people
call
this
ocean
the
pacific
and
they
call
the
happy
islands
japan
but
the
meaning
is
just
the
same
those
are
only
their
names
that
you
find
them
by
on
the
map
in
the
geography
they
are
truly
happy
islands
for
the
sun
shines
there
so
brightly
that
all
the
people
go
about
with
pleasant
smiling
faces
and
the
children
play
out
of
doors
the
whole
year
through
without
ever
quarreling
and
they
are
never
never
spanked
of
course
the
reason
for
that
is
that
they
are
so
good
they
never
never
need
it
or
maybe
their
fathers
and
mothers
do
not
believe
in
spanking
i
have
even
been
told
though
i
do
know
whether
to
think
true
or
not
that
japanese
parents
believe
more
in
than
in
punishments
to
make
children
good
anyway
the
children
there
are
very
good
indeed
in
a
little
town
near
a
large
city
on
one
of
the
happy
islands
there
is
a
garden
in
the
garden
stands
a
house
and
in
that
house
there
live
taro
who
is
a
boy
and
take
pronounce
who
is
a
girl
they
are
twins
they
are
japanese
twins
and
they
are
just
five
years
old
both
of
them
of
course
taro
and
take
do
not
live
alone
in
the
house
in
the
garden
their
father
and
mother
live
there
too
and
their
grandmother
who
is
very
old
and
the
baby
who
is
very
young
taro
and
take
can
not
remember
when
grandmother
and
father
and
mother
happened
because
they
were
all
there
when
the
twins
came
and
the
twins
could
not
possibly
imagine
the
world
without
father
and
mother
and
grandmother
but
with
the
baby
it
was
different
one
day
there
was
any
baby
at
all
and
the
next
day
after
that
there
he
was
looking
very
new
but
quite
at
home
already
in
the
little
house
in
the
garden
where
taro
and
take
lived
taro
means
eldest
son
and
the
baby
might
have
been
called
jiro
because
jiro
means
second
and
he
was
the
second
boy
in
the
family
but
from
the
day
he
came
they
called
him
just
that
is
what
they
call
boy
babies
in
japan
take
means
bamboo
and
the
twins
father
and
mother
named
their
little
daughter
take
because
they
hoped
she
would
grow
up
to
be
tall
and
slender
and
strong
and
graceful
like
the
bamboo
tree
now
can
you
think
of
anything
nicer
in
this
world
than
being
twins
and
living
with
a
mother
and
father
and
grandmother
and
a
baby
brother
in
a
dear
little
house
in
a
dear
little
garden
in
a
dear
little
queer
little
town
in
the
middle
of
the
happy
islands
that
lie
in
the
ocean
of
peace
taro
and
take
thought
it
was
the
nicest
thing
that
could
possibly
have
happened
though
as
they
had
ever
lived
anywhere
else
or
been
anybody
but
themselves
for
a
single
minute
i
do
see
how
they
could
be
quite
so
sure
about
it
this
book
is
all
about
taro
and
take
and
the
baby
and
what
a
nice
time
they
had
living
and
if
you
want
to
know
some
of
the
things
that
happened
on
the
very
first
day
that
the
twins
and
ever
saw
each
other
you
can
turn
over
to
the
next
page
and
read
about
the
day
the
baby
came
that
tells
all
about
it
just
exactly
as
it
was
the
day
the
baby
came
the
day
the
baby
came
taro
and
take
were
standing
right
beside
their
father
early
one
morning
when
the
nurse
came
into
the
room
with
a
bundle
in
her
arms
it
was
a
knobby
kind
of
a
bundle
and
there
was
something
in
it
that
squirmed
the
nurse
looked
so
happy
and
smiling
that
the
twins
knew
at
once
there
must
be
something
very
nice
in
the
bundle
but
what
it
was
they
could
not
guess
taro
thought
maybe
it
a
puppy
he
had
wanted
a
puppy
for
a
long
time
and
take
thought
perhaps
it
a
kitten
but
it
looks
pretty
large
for
a
kitten
and
it
does
mew
kittens
always
mew
and
they
both
thought
anyway
it
alive
the
nurse
carried
the
bundle
across
the
room
she
knelt
down
on
the
floor
before
the
twins
father
and
laid
it
at
his
feet
the
twins
father
looked
very
much
surprised
and
as
for
taro
and
take
they
felt
just
exactly
the
way
you
feel
when
you
look
at
your
stocking
on
christmas
morning
they
dropped
down
on
their
knees
beside
the
bundle
one
on
each
side
of
their
father
they
wanted
dreadfully
to
open
it
they
wanted
so
dreadfully
to
open
it
that
they
had
to
hold
their
hands
hard
to
keep
from
touching
it
but
they
never
even
laid
a
finger
on
it
because
the
nurse
had
given
it
to
their
father
taro
just
said
aloud
is
it
a
puppy
at
the
very
same
moment
take
said
is
it
a
kitten
and
then
their
father
said
i
have
opened
the
bundle
yet
so
how
can
i
tell
we
must
ask
the
nurse
what
is
it
natsu
and
natsu
the
nurse
put
her
two
hands
together
on
the
matting
in
front
of
her
bobbed
her
head
down
nearly
to
the
floor
and
said
it
is
a
little
son
master
will
you
accept
him
then
the
father
sat
right
down
on
the
floor
too
between
taro
and
take
he
took
the
little
squirming
bundle
in
his
arms
and
turned
back
the
covers
and
there
was
a
beautiful
baby
boy
with
long
narrow
eyes
and
a
lock
of
hair
that
stood
straight
up
on
the
top
of
his
head
oh
oh
is
he
truly
ours
a
real
live
baby
for
us
to
keep
cried
take
would
you
like
to
keep
him
her
father
asked
take
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
oh
yes
yes
she
said
for
then
i
can
have
a
little
brother
of
my
own
to
carry
on
my
back
just
the
way
o
kiku
san
carries
hers
i
never
had
a
thing
but
borrowed
babies
before
and
o
kiku
san
is
not
polite
about
lending
hers
at
all
please
please
let
me
hold
him
she
held
up
her
arms
and
the
father
laid
the
little
baby
in
them
very
very
gently
taro
was
so
surprised
to
see
a
baby
in
the
bundle
that
he
had
not
said
a
word
he
just
sat
still
and
looked
astonished
well
taro
how
is
it
with
you
said
his
father
would
you
like
to
keep
the
baby
too
i
even
rather
have
him
than
a
puppy
said
taro
very
solemnly
and
that
was
a
great
deal
for
taro
to
say
for
he
had
wanted
a
puppy
for
ever
so
many
weeks
so
would
i
rather
have
him
than
a
puppy
the
father
said
ever
so
much
rather
just
then
the
baby
puckered
up
his
nose
and
opened
his
little
bit
of
a
mouth
and
a
great
big
squeal
came
out
of
it
you
would
never
have
believed
that
such
a
big
squeal
could
possibly
come
out
of
such
a
little
mouth
and
he
squirmed
more
than
ever
then
natsu
the
nurse
said
there
there
little
one
come
to
your
old
natsu
and
she
will
carry
you
to
mother
again
let
me
carry
him
take
begged
no
let
me
said
taro
but
natsu
said
no
no
i
will
carry
him
myself
but
you
may
come
with
me
if
you
want
to
and
see
your
mother
so
taro
and
take
and
their
father
all
tiptoed
quietly
into
the
mother
room
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
beside
her
bed
they
sat
on
the
floor
because
everybody
sits
on
the
floor
in
japan
the
bed
was
on
the
floor
too
it
was
made
of
many
thick
quilts
and
the
pillow
a
little
block
of
wood
we
should
think
it
very
uncomfortable
but
the
mother
did
not
think
so
she
lay
with
the
wooden
pillow
under
her
head
in
such
a
way
that
her
hair
was
not
mussed
by
it
instead
it
looked
just
as
neat
as
if
she
were
going
to
a
party
and
it
was
just
as
nice
as
a
party
because
they
all
had
such
a
happy
time
together
watching
the
new
baby
acted
just
like
all
the
other
babies
in
the
world
first
he
got
his
fist
into
his
mouth
by
accident
and
sucked
it
then
he
got
it
out
again
without
meaning
to
and
punched
himself
in
the
nose
with
it
such
a
funny
little
nose
no
bigger
than
a
small
button
then
he
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
yawned
see
how
sleepy
the
little
mouse
is
said
the
mother
run
out
and
play
now
my
children
and
let
him
rest
taro
and
take
left
the
room
softly
and
went
out
on
the
porch
they
sat
down
on
the
top
step
to
talk
over
the
wonderful
thing
that
had
happened
it
was
springtime
and
the
flowers
in
the
garden
were
just
pushing
their
leaves
through
the
ground
the
sun
was
shining
and
a
little
new
yellow
butterfly
that
had
only
just
crept
out
of
its
snug
cocoon
that
very
day
was
dancing
about
in
the
sunshine
i
suppose
we
were
new
once
too
were
we
said
take
watching
the
butterfly
i
suppose
we
were
taro
answered
we
grew
right
up
out
of
the
root
of
a
tree
natsu
told
me
so
i
wonder
which
tree
it
was
take
said
it
must
have
been
one
of
the
trees
in
our
own
garden
of
course
taro
answered
or
else
we
should
be
here
would
it
have
been
a
terrible
accident
if
we
had
happened
to
grow
in
some
other
garden
said
take
she
looked
quite
scared
just
at
the
very
thought
of
such
a
thing
maybe
if
we
had
we
should
have
been
ourselves
at
all
taro
answered
he
looked
a
little
scared
too
who
should
we
have
been
then
asked
take
i
do
know
i
sure
taro
said
i
ca
think
but
anyway
we
lucky
that
it
did
happen
we
here
and
ourselves
let
go
into
the
garden
this
minute
and
see
if
we
can
find
tree
said
take
he
so
new
that
maybe
we
can
find
the
very
spot
where
he
grew
the
fairies
would
surely
hide
the
place
so
we
could
find
it
said
taro
but
we
can
try
let
go
softly
then
maybe
they
wo
hear
us
they
tiptoed
out
into
the
garden
how
i
wish
you
could
see
their
garden
there
are
all
sorts
of
wonderful
places
in
it
it
very
large
but
it
has
in
it
a
little
bit
of
a
toy
mountain
and
a
tiny
lake
with
little
weeny
goldfish
in
it
and
a
little
stream
of
water
like
a
baby
river
that
runs
into
the
lake
and
best
of
all
there
is
a
curved
bridge
painted
red
just
big
enough
for
the
twins
to
walk
over
if
they
are
very
careful
and
do
bounce
the
twins
grandfather
made
this
garden
for
their
father
to
play
in
when
he
was
a
little
boy
so
they
all
love
it
dearly
there
are
iris
plants
and
lilies
beside
the
tiny
lake
and
a
funny
little
pine
tree
a
very
little
pine
tree
just
a
few
feet
high
grows
out
of
some
rocks
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
the
twins
crossed
the
tiny
red
bridge
and
crept
up
the
on
the
until
they
reached
the
little
pine
tree
do
you
it
could
be
the
pine
tree
take
whispered
maybe
it
so
small
just
the
right
size
for
taro
whispered
back
the
twins
looked
carefully
all
around
the
pine
tree
but
its
trunk
was
gnarled
and
old
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
so
little
a
tree
could
be
so
old
but
the
japanese
know
how
to
keep
a
tree
small
like
a
toy
tree
even
if
it
has
been
growing
for
a
hundred
years
this
tree
was
a
hundred
years
old
because
their
grandfather
had
set
it
out
when
the
twins
father
was
a
little
boy
and
the
twins
father
was
anywhere
near
a
hundred
years
old
i
do
believe
a
darling
little
pink
baby
could
ever
grow
here
said
take
when
she
had
looked
all
around
the
pine
tree
let
look
at
the
plum
tree
they
ran
to
the
plum
tree
that
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
they
looked
all
about
it
on
the
south
side
of
the
plum
tree
in
the
sunshine
there
was
a
long
branch
near
the
ground
and
on
the
branch
what
do
you
think
there
was
a
whole
row
of
tiny
pink
buds
almost
ready
to
burst
into
bloom
oh
taro
taro
look
here
take
cried
here
the
baby
very
own
branch
i
sure
of
it
for
there
are
any
other
buds
on
the
whole
tree
that
are
as
near
out
as
these
let
cut
off
this
spray
and
carry
it
into
the
house
to
put
in
the
vase
said
taro
oh
yes
and
i
show
mother
how
beautifully
i
can
arrange
it
just
the
way
i
was
taught
to
do
it
take
answered
nothing
could
be
nicer
for
a
baby
flower
than
a
dear
little
branch
like
this
with
pink
buds
on
it
i
break
it
for
you
said
taro
i
strong
he
broke
the
branch
carefully
just
where
take
told
him
to
he
took
great
pains
not
to
tear
the
bark
or
hurt
the
tree
then
they
carried
it
into
the
house
in
one
corner
of
the
room
there
was
a
little
alcove
there
is
one
in
every
japanese
house
it
is
called
the
honorable
recess
and
it
is
where
their
most
beautiful
things
are
placed
there
is
always
a
picture
or
perhaps
two
or
three
of
them
hanging
like
long
banners
on
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
honorable
recess
these
banner
pictures
are
called
kakemono
there
is
also
a
small
table
with
a
vase
on
it
standing
near
in
this
vase
there
are
always
flowers
or
a
beautiful
branch
with
green
leaves
in
japan
the
little
girls
are
taught
to
arrange
flowers
just
as
carefully
as
they
are
taught
to
read
so
that
the
honorable
recess
may
be
kept
beautiful
to
look
at
take
filled
the
vase
with
water
she
fitted
a
little
forked
stick
into
the
top
of
the
vase
and
stuck
the
plum
branch
through
the
crotch
of
the
forked
stick
so
it
would
fall
over
she
twisted
it
this
way
and
that
until
it
looked
just
right
then
she
called
taro
to
see
it
on
the
wall
of
the
recess
was
the
picture
of
a
black
crow
perched
on
the
branch
of
a
pine
tree
in
a
rainstorm
his
shoulders
were
all
hunched
up
to
shed
the
rain
and
he
look
happy
at
all
he
looked
funny
and
miserable
the
twins
looked
at
the
honorable
recess
a
long
time
their
father
came
and
looked
too
then
taro
said
i
do
think
that
crow
in
the
rainstorm
looks
right
hanging
up
beside
the
plum
branch
the
crow
looks
so
sorry
and
we
are
all
so
glad
i
think
just
the
same
said
take
so
do
i
said
their
father
how
would
you
like
to
go
out
to
the
kura
and
see
if
we
can
find
a
real
happy
picture
to
hang
up
there
taro
and
take
jumped
up
and
down
and
clapped
their
hands
for
joy
they
were
so
glad
to
go
out
to
the
kura
the
kura
is
a
little
fireproof
house
in
the
garden
you
can
see
the
corner
of
the
roof
sticking
out
from
behind
the
mountain
in
the
picture
in
it
taro
and
take
and
their
father
and
mother
and
grandmother
keep
all
their
greatest
treasures
that
is
why
taro
and
take
were
so
glad
to
go
there
nearly
everybody
in
japan
has
just
such
a
safe
little
house
in
the
garden
maybe
you
can
guess
the
reason
why
it
is
only
because
of
fires
it
because
of
earthquakes
too
every
once
in
a
while
almost
every
day
in
fact
the
earth
trembles
and
shakes
in
the
happy
islands
the
houses
are
built
mostly
of
wood
and
paper
and
if
the
earthquakes
tumble
them
over
they
sometimes
catch
fire
but
if
the
nicest
things
are
safe
in
the
kura
it
does
matter
so
much
if
the
house
is
burned
up
you
see
there
are
always
plenty
of
fires
for
boys
to
see
in
japan
taro
had
seen
ever
so
many
before
he
was
five
years
old
and
the
twins
had
both
felt
ever
so
many
earthquakes
they
were
so
used
to
them
that
they
did
mind
them
any
more
than
you
mind
a
thundershower
all
of
taro
kites
were
kept
in
the
kura
the
big
dragon
kite
had
a
box
all
to
itself
take
dolls
were
there
too
but
dear
me
here
i
am
telling
you
about
kites
and
dolls
when
i
should
be
telling
you
about
the
picture
of
the
crow
and
what
they
did
with
it
first
the
twins
father
took
it
down
off
the
wall
and
rolled
it
up
then
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
he
and
taro
and
take
all
went
out
into
the
garden
when
they
reached
the
kura
the
father
unlocked
the
door
and
all
three
stepped
inside
it
was
not
very
light
but
the
air
was
sweet
and
spicy
on
the
shelves
about
the
room
were
many
beautiful
boxes
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
the
father
reached
up
to
a
high
shelf
and
took
down
three
boxes
that
looked
just
alike
on
the
outside
he
opened
the
first
and
took
out
a
roll
neatly
wrapped
and
tied
with
a
silk
string
it
was
this
picture
of
a
japanese
lady
who
has
run
out
quickly
to
take
her
washing
off
the
line
because
of
a
shower
of
rain
he
held
it
up
high
so
the
twins
could
see
it
ho
ho
laughed
taro
the
lady
has
lost
her
clog
she
is
in
such
a
hurry
she
just
as
wet
as
the
crow
take
said
and
i
do
believe
she
feels
a
bit
happier
she
be
wetter
still
before
she
gets
her
washing
in
she
the
father
said
the
clouds
seem
to
have
burst
just
over
her
head
and
dear
me
how
the
wind
is
blowing
her
about
no
she
wo
do
beside
the
plum
branch
he
opened
another
box
and
unrolled
the
next
picture
here
it
is
taro
and
take
looked
at
it
a
long
time
then
take
said
what
a
beautiful
dress
the
lady
has
on
like
to
dress
just
like
that
when
i
grow
up
but
she
is
walking
out
in
the
snow
with
an
umbrella
over
her
head
said
taro
it
is
winter
now
then
the
father
unrolled
the
third
how
do
you
like
this
one
he
asked
it
was
a
picture
of
a
bird
with
a
grasshopper
in
her
bill
flying
to
a
nest
with
three
little
birds
in
it
the
little
birds
had
their
mouths
wide
open
oh
that
the
very
one
cried
take
it
just
like
mother
taking
care
of
taro
and
the
baby
and
me
let
take
that
one
so
they
left
that
one
out
and
carefully
rolled
up
the
others
and
put
them
back
in
place
they
put
the
crow
away
too
the
twins
were
just
turning
round
to
go
out
the
door
when
their
father
reached
down
one
more
package
from
a
high
shelf
wait
a
minute
he
said
i
have
some
thing
else
to
show
you
the
package
was
long
and
thin
and
the
covering
was
a
piece
of
silk
with
the
family
crest
embroidered
on
it
in
colored
silks
this
was
the
crest
taro
and
take
knew
it
at
once
for
it
was
embroidered
or
stamped
upon
the
sleeves
of
their
kimonos
it
was
the
sign
of
their
family
the
father
took
off
this
cover
under
it
was
a
covering
of
brocaded
silk
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
the
twins
before
it
was
all
unwrapped
they
were
so
eager
to
see
what
was
in
the
package
at
last
their
father
held
up
a
beautiful
sword
with
both
his
hands
it
was
a
long
sword
with
a
handle
of
carved
ivory
and
a
sheath
with
curious
designs
on
it
the
father
bowed
to
the
sword
you
bow
to
the
sword
also
my
son
he
said
to
taro
it
is
wonderfully
made
it
commands
respect
taro
bowed
to
the
sword
then
his
father
drew
the
long
blade
from
the
sheath
he
turned
the
edge
carefully
toward
himself
and
away
from
the
twins
i
want
you
to
see
this
sword
taro
he
said
for
some
time
it
will
be
yours
because
you
are
my
oldest
son
whose
was
it
asked
taro
it
was
your
grandfather
sword
his
father
answered
and
you
are
old
enough
now
to
know
what
it
means
i
want
you
to
remember
what
i
say
to
you
as
long
as
you
live
your
grandfather
was
a
gentleman
a
samurai
of
japan
this
was
the
sword
he
always
wore
many
years
ago
there
was
trouble
in
japan
and
to
help
the
emperor
all
the
great
dukes
in
the
kingdom
gave
up
their
dukedoms
the
samurai
also
gave
up
their
honorable
positions
in
the
service
of
these
dukes
and
became
common
citizens
then
your
grandfather
put
away
his
sword
years
after
when
he
was
old
he
gave
it
to
me
but
i
do
not
wear
it
either
although
i
too
am
of
the
samurai
and
the
sword
is
their
badge
of
honor
it
is
much
better
to
keep
it
safely
here
and
think
sometimes
of
what
it
means
than
to
wear
it
only
for
display
you
can
show
that
you
are
a
son
of
the
samurai
by
acting
as
a
gentleman
should
act
you
do
not
need
the
sword
for
that
a
samurai
should
never
do
a
mean
thing
he
should
keep
his
life
clean
and
shining
like
the
sword
and
he
must
always
do
what
is
best
for
japan
whether
it
is
best
for
him
or
not
this
was
a
long
speech
the
twins
listened
with
all
their
ears
four
of
them
but
they
did
not
quite
understand
it
all
they
understood
that
their
father
loved
the
sword
and
that
some
time
it
was
to
be
taro
and
that
he
must
be
a
brave
good
boy
or
he
would
not
be
worthy
of
it
and
that
was
a
good
deal
after
all
may
i
touch
it
taro
asked
you
may
take
it
in
your
own
hands
said
his
father
and
he
gave
it
to
taro
almost
as
tenderly
as
he
had
given
to
take
that
morning
he
showed
him
the
polite
way
to
hold
it
with
the
edge
toward
himself
then
while
taro
held
the
sword
his
father
said
i
want
to
tell
you
a
poem
that
our
emperor
father
wrote
while
he
was
emperor
and
by
and
by
when
you
are
bigger
i
want
you
to
learn
it
by
heart
then
when
you
are
a
man
and
look
at
the
sword
you
will
remember
it
this
is
the
poem
there
is
no
second
way
whereby
to
show
the
love
of
fatherland
whether
one
stand
a
soldier
under
arms
against
the
foe
or
stay
at
home
a
peaceful
citizen
the
way
of
loyalty
is
still
the
same
the
father
voice
was
very
solemn
as
he
said
this
verse
the
twins
were
quite
still
as
he
wrapped
the
sword
in
its
silken
coverings
and
put
it
back
again
on
the
high
shelf
this
was
a
long
time
for
take
to
be
quiet
but
she
was
thinking
when
their
father
had
locked
the
kura
and
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
house
with
the
picture
of
the
birds
she
said
to
him
father
am
i
not
a
child
of
the
samurai
too
yes
my
daughter
her
father
answered
but
you
are
a
girl
it
is
not
your
fault
little
one
he
added
kindly
we
can
not
all
be
boys
of
course
but
to
the
keeping
of
the
sons
is
given
the
honor
of
the
family
it
is
a
great
trust
do
i
do
anything
at
all
for
the
honor
of
my
family
asked
take
when
you
are
grown
up
you
will
marry
and
live
with
your
husband
family
and
serve
them
in
every
way
you
can
her
father
answered
you
will
belong
to
them
you
see
now
you
must
just
be
a
good
girl
and
mind
your
father
and
grandmother
and
mother
and
your
brothers
i
just
as
old
as
taro
said
little
take
and
i
think
i
know
just
as
much
why
ca
he
mind
me
some
of
the
time
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
take
turns
but
taro
is
a
boy
said
her
father
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
japanese
girls
must
always
mind
their
brothers
must
i
mind
too
asked
take
yes
too
wo
anybody
ever
mind
me
at
all
asked
take
when
you
get
to
be
a
then
you
can
have
your
turn
said
her
father
smiling
your
son
wife
will
obey
you
will
my
son
obey
me
too
asked
take
no
you
must
obey
him
if
he
is
the
head
of
the
house
her
father
explained
it
a
very
long
time
to
wait
sighed
take
and
nothing
but
a
to
mind
me
at
last
her
under
lip
puckered
a
little
and
she
frowned
a
little
frown
right
in
the
middle
of
her
forehead
tut
tut
said
her
father
girls
and
women
should
always
be
gentle
and
smiling
you
must
never
frown
he
looked
quite
shocked
at
the
very
idea
of
such
a
thing
take
tried
to
look
pleasant
and
a
funny
thing
is
that
when
you
make
yourself
look
pleasant
you
begin
to
feel
so
too
take
felt
pleasant
almost
right
away
they
went
into
the
house
and
hung
the
picture
of
the
mother
bird
in
the
place
of
the
crow
beside
the
spray
of
plum
when
it
was
all
done
this
is
the
way
the
honorable
recess
looked
take
looked
at
it
for
a
while
and
then
she
said
i
believe
i
shall
feel
sorry
about
minding
after
all
because
i
love
him
so
much
that
the
way
a
little
japanese
girl
should
feel
said
her
father
now
come
in
and
let
us
take
a
look
at
him
they
found
awake
take
knelt
down
on
the
mat
in
front
of
him
to
see
him
better
put
your
head
down
on
the
matting
take
her
father
said
and
take
bowed
her
head
to
the
floor
then
the
father
took
the
baby
in
his
arms
and
placed
his
tiny
foot
on
take
neck
that
means
that
you
must
always
do
what
he
wants
you
to
he
said
i
will
said
little
take
the
mother
smiled
at
take
as
she
knelt
on
the
floor
with
the
baby
foot
on
her
neck
then
she
turned
her
face
the
other
way
on
her
little
wooden
pillow
and
sighed
just
a
very
gentle
little
sigh
that
nobody
heard
at
all
morning
in
the
little
house
morning
in
the
little
house
one
morning
when
was
just
one
month
old
his
big
brother
taro
woke
up
very
early
the
birds
woke
him
they
were
singing
in
the
garden
see
see
see
they
sang
morning
is
here
morning
is
here
taro
heard
them
in
his
sleep
he
turned
over
then
he
stretched
his
arms
and
legs
and
sat
up
in
bed
rubbing
his
eyes
the
candle
in
the
tall
paper
lamp
beside
his
bed
had
burned
almost
out
but
it
was
light
enough
so
he
could
see
that
take
in
her
bed
across
the
room
was
still
asleep
with
her
head
on
her
little
cushion
taro
called
very
softly
take
take
wake
up
but
take
slept
so
soundly
she
did
not
hear
him
father
and
mother
and
the
baby
were
all
asleep
in
the
next
room
he
did
not
want
to
wake
them
because
it
was
still
so
early
in
the
morning
so
he
crept
softly
along
the
floor
to
take
bed
and
whispered
in
her
ear
wake
up
wake
up
but
she
wake
up
then
taro
took
a
jay
feather
which
he
had
found
in
the
garden
the
day
before
and
tickled
take
nose
first
she
rubbed
her
nose
then
she
sneezed
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
taro
whispered
taro
but
i
have
said
a
single
word
take
whispered
back
you
sneezed
though
said
taro
that
just
as
bad
it
will
wake
up
our
honorable
parents
just
the
same
well
you
should
tickle
my
poor
little
nose
then
said
take
your
honorable
nose
was
tickled
so
that
you
would
wake
up
and
hear
the
birds
sing
said
taro
it
is
much
nicer
than
sleeping
besides
do
you
remember
what
is
going
to
happen
we
are
going
to
take
to
the
temple
a
temple
is
something
like
a
church
only
they
do
not
do
the
same
things
in
temples
that
we
do
in
our
churches
the
twins
loved
to
go
to
the
temple
because
they
had
a
very
good
time
when
they
went
there
they
liked
it
as
much
as
you
like
thanksgiving
day
and
the
fourth
of
july
when
take
remembered
that
they
were
going
to
take
to
the
temple
she
clapped
her
little
brown
hands
oh
i
so
glad
she
said
then
she
popped
out
from
under
the
covers
of
her
bed
and
stood
up
on
the
soft
straw
matting
she
was
no
sooner
out
of
bed
than
from
far
away
came
the
of
a
great
gong
and
then
rolled
a
great
drum
hark
said
taro
there
go
the
temple
bells
and
the
priests
are
beating
the
sunrise
drums
it
not
so
very
early
after
all
now
you
hear
grannie
stick
rapping
for
the
maids
to
get
up
take
answered
the
temple
bells
always
wake
her
and
at
that
very
minute
sounded
grannie
stick
on
the
woodwork
of
the
room
where
the
maids
slept
in
the
little
house
in
the
garden
where
the
twins
lived
there
are
no
thick
walls
there
are
only
pretty
wooden
screens
covered
with
fine
white
paper
these
screens
slide
back
and
forth
in
grooves
and
when
they
are
all
shoved
back
at
once
the
whole
house
is
turned
into
one
big
bright
room
this
is
why
the
twins
had
to
be
so
careful
not
to
make
any
noise
even
a
tiny
noise
can
be
heard
all
through
a
house
that
has
only
paper
walls
you
see
but
every
one
is
supposed
to
get
up
at
sunrise
in
the
little
house
in
the
garden
anyway
the
maids
were
stirring
as
soon
as
grannie
called
them
they
rolled
back
the
shutters
around
the
porch
and
made
so
much
noise
in
doing
it
that
father
and
mother
woke
up
too
then
the
twins
did
keep
so

out
into
the
garden
there

been
a
shower
in
the
night
and
the
leaves
were
all
shiny
they
had
been
washed
so
clean
by
the
rain
the
dew
sparkled
on
the
green
iris
leaves
beside
the
tiny
river
and
the
sunshine
made
the
fish
look
like
lumps
of
living
gold
in
the
blue
waters
of
the
little
lake
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
wistaria
vine
that
grew
over
the
porch
and
two
doves
were
cooing
on
the
old
stone
lantern
that
stood
by

little
lake

were
taro

doves

held
out

upon
his
shoulders

a
few
rice
kernels
from
the
sleeve
of
his
kimono
which
he
used
as
a
pocket
and
fed
the
birds
from
his
hand
they
were
so
tame
they
even
picked
some
from
his
lips

and
she
ran
to
the
kitchen
where
the

white
rice

in
her

she
threw
some
tiny
bits
of
the
wafer
into
the
water

them
and
came
to
the
surface
then

reached
down
and
held
the
wafer
in
her
fingers
the
little
fish

all
about

the
wafer

of
them

nibbled
her
finger

sound
of
the
gong
breakfast

she
danced
up
the
gravel
walk
to
the
house
her
hair
bobbing
up
and
down
and
her
sash
flying
in
the
wind
so
that
she
looked
like
a
big
blue
butterfly
taro
came
too
and
they
sat
down
on
mats
in
the
kitchen
to
eat
their
breakfast

time

down
on
some
soft
mats
and
combed

still
like
a
brave
little
girl
though
there
were
three
snarls
in
it
and
natsu
pulled
dreadfully
when
every
one
was
ready
to
go
they
looked
very
splendid
indeed

all
wore

embroidered
on

and

the
mother
she
took
in
her
arms
natsu
slid
open
the
door
and
they
all
stepped
out
on
the
porch
how
they
went
to
the
temple
how
they
went
to
the
temple
the
twins
were
just
stepping
into
their
clogs
when
the
front
gate
opened
and
what
do
you
think
they
saw
in
came
trotting
three
brown
men
each
one
pulling
a
little
carriage
behind
him
they
came
right
up
to
the
porch
take
was
just
standing
on
one
foot
ready
to
slip
her
other
one
into
the
strap
of
her
clog
when
they
came
in
she
was
so
surprised
she
fell
right
over
backward
she
picked
herself
up
again
quickly
and
hopped
along
with
one
shoe
on
and
one
shoe
off
are
we
going
to
ride
she
gasped
her
father
laughed
yes

he
said
we
are
going
to
ride
to
the
temple
and
you
and
taro
shall
ride
in
one
rickshaw
all
by
yourselves
the
name
of
these
little
carriages
drawn
by
men
instead
of
horses
is
jinrickshas
but
he
called
them
rickshaws
for
short
the
twins
were
so
happy
they
could
hardly
keep
still
they
looked
at
all
three
rickshaws
and
all
three
men
and
then
they
said
to
their
father
may
we
ride
in
this
one
it
had
red
wheels
yes
you
may
ride
in
that
one
he
said
then
he
got
into
the
one
with
green
wheels
and
rode
away
mother
and
grannie
and
the
baby
got
into
the
next
one
and
their
rickshaw
man
trotted
away
after
father
keep
close
behind
us
the
mother
called
back
to
the
twins
they
got
into
the
rickshaw
with
the
red
wheels
and
away
they
flew
the
twins
had
never
been
in
a
rickshaw
alone
before
in
all
their
lives
they
sat
up
very
straight
and
held
on
tight
because
it
bounced
a
good
deal
and
the
rickshaw
man
could
run
very
fast
i
feel
as
grand
as
a
princess
take
whispered
to
taro
how
do
you
feel
i
feel
like
a
son
of
the
samurai
taro
whispered
back
that
was
the
proudest
feeling
he
could
think
of
there
were
so
very
many
interesting
things
to
see
that
the
twins
did
talk
much
for
a
while
you
see
it
hard
work
to
use
your
mouth
and
your
eyes
and
your
ears
all
at
once
so
the
twins
just
used
their
eyes
it
was
still
quite
early
in
the
morning
when
they
reached
the
city
streets
here
they
saw
men
with
baskets
hung
from
poles
going
from
house
to
house
some
were
selling
vegetables
some
had
fish
and
others
were
selling
flowers
or
brooms
they
saw
little
girls
with
baby
brothers
on
their
backs
skipping
rope
or
bouncing
balls
the
baby
head
wobbled
dreadfully
when
his
little
sister
skipped
but
he
did
cry
about
it
he
just
let
it
wobble
the
twins
rode
by
and
with
gay
kimonos
flapping
in
the
breeze
by
little
shops
where
people
were
making
paper
lanterns
by
and
by
houses
and
gardens
in
strange
places
they
had
never
seen
before
they
saw
an
old
priest
going
from
door
to
door
holding
out
his
bowl
for
money
in
one
street
carpenters
were
putting
up
a
new
house
and
once
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
very
bridge
that
leads
to
the
emperor
palace
by
and
by
they
reached
the
gate
of
the
temple
grounds
all
the
rickshaws
stopped
here
and
everybody
got
out
the
mother
put
on
her
back
and
they
all
started
in
a
procession
for
the
temple
first
walked
the
father
looking
very
proud
then
came
the
twins
looking
quite
proud
too
then
came
mother
and
grannie
and
and
they
looked
proudest
of
all
when
they
got
inside
the
gate
the
twins
thought
they
were
in
fairyland
you
would
have
thought
so
too
if
you
could
have
been
there
with
them
they
saw
so
many
wonderful
things
that
day
that
if
i
were
to
tell
you
about
every
one
of
them
it
would
fill
up
this
whole
book
first
of
all
they
came
into
a
broad
roadway
with
beautiful
great
cedar
trees
on
each
side
under
these
trees
were
little
booths
great
paper
lanterns
and
banners
of
all
colors
hung
in
front
of
the
booths
and
when
they
waved
gayly
in
the
wind
the
place
looked
like
a
giant
in
full
bloom
near
the
temple
entrance
was
a
great
stone
trough
full
of
clear
water
there
was
a
wooden
dipper
floating
on
it
come
here
said
the
father
the
twins
grandmother
and
mother
with
baby
on
her
back
all
came
at
once
and
stood
in
a
row
beside
the
trough
they
put
out
their
hands
the
father
took
the
dipper
and
poured
water
on
their
hands
when
their
hands
were
quite
clean
they
rinsed
their
mouths
too
then
they
entered
the
temple
vestibule
there
were
more
little
booths
in
the
temple
vestibule
and
there
were
so
many
people
big
and
little
crowding
about
that
the
father
took
the
twins
hands
so
they
would
get
lost
first
he
led
them
to
a
place
where
they
bought
some
cooked
peas
on
a
little
plate
and
some
rice
he
gave
the
peas
to
taro
and
some
of
the
rice
to
take
the
twins
wondered
what
in
the
world
their
father
wanted
with
peas
and
rice
they
soon
found
out
in
the
very
next
place
was
a
little
stall
and
in
the
little
stall
was
a
tiny
tiny
white
horse
no
bigger
than
a
big
dog
even
its
eyes
were
white
oh
father
the
twins
said
both
together
whose
little
horse
is
it
it
kwannon
little
horse
the
father
said
taro
you
may
give
him
the
peas
taro
held
out
the
plate
the
little
white
pony
put
his
nose
in
the
plate
and
ate
them
all
up
he
sniffed
up
taro
sleeve
as
if
he
wanted
more
take
patted
his
back
who
is
kwannon
she
asked
kwannon
is
a
beautiful
goddess
who
loves
little
children
said
the
father
does
she
live
here
asked
taro
this
is
her
temple
where
people
come
to
worship
the
father
answered
we
are
going
to
pray
to
her
to
take
good
care
of
always
did
you
ask
her
to
take
care
of
us
too
asked
take
yes
we
brought
you
both
here
when
you
were
a
month
old
just
as
we
are
bringing
now
the
father
replied
does
she
take
care
of
all
little
children
take
said
she
loves
them
all
and
takes
care
of
all
who
ask
for
her
protection
my
said
take
she
must
have
her
hands
full
with
such
a
large
family
her
father
laughed
but
you
see
she
has
a
great
many
hands
he
said
if
she
had
only
two
like
us
it
would
be
hard
for
her
to
take
care
of
so
many
i
never
saw
her
take
care
of
me
said
taro
we
do
not
see
the
gods
their
father
answered
but
we
must
worship
and
obey
them
just
the
same
i
think
kwannon
must
love
little
children
said
take
because
she
wants
them
to
have
such
good
times
in
her
temple
they
said
to
the
little
horse
and
walked
through
an
opening
into
a
courtyard
beyond
the
moment
they
stepped
into
the
courtyard
a
flock
of
white
pigeons
flew
down
and
settled
all
about
them
take
may
feed
the
pigeons
the
father
said
they
are
kwannon
pigeons
take
threw
her
rice
on
the
ground
the
pigeons
picked
it
all
up
so
many
people
fed
them
that
they
were
almost
too
fat
to
fly
at
another
booth
their
father
bought
some
little
rings
of
perfumed
incense
he
put
them
in
his
sleeve
his
sleeves
could
hold
more
things
than
all
a
boy
pockets
put
together
when
they
reached
the
great
door
of
the
temple
itself
the
father
said
now
we
must
take
off
our
shoes
so
they
all
slipped
their
toes
out
of
their
clogs
and
went
into
the
temple
just
as
the
bell
in
the
courtyard
rang
out
with
a
great
boom
boom
boom
that
made
the
air
shiver
and
shake
all
about
them
the
temple
was
one
big
shadowy
room
with
tall
red
columns
all
about
it
just
like
a
great
forest
full
of
trees
is
it
taro
whispered
to
take
as
they
went
in
it
almost
scares
me
take
whispered
back
it
so
big
directly
in
front
of
the
entrance
there
was
another
bell
a
long
red
streamer
hung
from
its
clapper
and
under
it
was
a
great
box
with
bars
over
the
top
on
the
box
there
perched
a
great
white
rooster
the
father
pulled
the
red
streamer
and
rang
the
bell
then
he
threw
a
piece
of
money
into
the
box
it
fell
with
a
great
noise
crowed
the
rooster
he
seemed
very
much
pleased
about
the
money
though
it
was
meant
for
the
priests
and
not
for
him
the
rooster
is
saying
thank
you
cried
take
hush
said
her
mother
then
the
father
drew
from
his
sleeve
a
little
rosary
of
beads
he
placed
it
over
his
hands
and
bowed
his
head
in
prayer
while
grannie
and
mother
and
baby
and
the
twins
stood
near
him
and
kept
very
still
when
he
had
finished
a
priest
came
up
the
father
bowed
to
the
priest
will
you
show
us
the
way
to
the
shrine
of
kwannon
he
asked
away
off
at
the
farther
end
of
the
temple
the
twins
could
see
a
great
altar
banners
and
lanterns
hung
about
it
and
people
were
kneeling
on
the
floor
before
it
praying
before
the
altar
was
an
open
brazier
with
incense
burning
in
it
come
this
way
said
the
priest
he
led
them
to
the
altar
the
father
took
from
his
mother
and
held
him
in
his
arms
the
priest
said
a
prayer
to
kwannon
and
blessed
the
baby
then
the
father
threw
incense
rings
on
the
little
fire
that
burned
in
the
brazier
before
the
altar
wreaths
of
smoke
began
to
curl
about
their
heads
the
air
was
filled
with
the
sweet
odor
of
it
some
of
it
went
up
nose
it
smarted
did
like
it
he
had
behaved
beautifully
up
to
that
time
and
i
am
sure
if
the
incense
had
gone
up
his
nose
he
would
have
kept
on
behaving
beautifully
but
it
did
and
sneezed
just
as
the
priest
finished
the
prayer
then
he
gave
a
great
scream
then
another
and
another
three
of
them
the
priest
smiled
but
the
father
did
smile
he
gave
back
to
his
mother
just
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
said
the
honorable
worshippers
will
be
disturbed
we
must
go
out
at
once
they
hurried
back
to
the
entrance
and
found
their
clogs
and
the
moment
they
were
outdoors
again
in
the
sweet
fresh
air
cuddled
down
on
his
mother
back
and
went
to
sleep
without
another
sound
near
the
temple
they
found
an
orchard
of
cherry
trees
in
full
bloom
people
were
sitting
under
the
cherry
trees
looking
at
the
blossoms
some
of
them
were
writing
little
verses
which
they
hung
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
they
did
this
because
they
loved
the
blossoms
so
much
children
were
playing
all
about
near
by
was
a
pretty
little
grannie
saw
it
first
i
am
thirsty
she
said
so
am
i
said
take
so
am
i
said
taro
we
all
thirsty
the
father
said
outside
the
under
the
trees
there
were
wooden
benches
they
sat
down
on
these
and
soon
little
maids
from
the
brought
them
trays
with
tea
and
sweet
they
sat
on
the
benches
and
sipped
their
tea
and
watched
the
people
moving
about
and
looked
up
at
the
cherry
blossoms
against
the
blue
sky
and
were
very
happy
indeed
the
mother
had
carried
all
the
way
on
her
back
so
maybe
she
was
a
little
tired
anyway
she
said
to
the
father
if
you
and
the
twins
want
to
go
farther
let
grannie
and
me
stay
here
and
rest
you
can
come
back
for
us
would
you
like
to
see
the
animals
the
father
asked
the
twins
taro
and
take
jumped
right
up
and
took
their
father
hands
one
on
each
side
and
then
they
all
walked
away
together
under
the
blossoming
trees
to
another
part
of
the
park
in
this
part
of
the
park
there
were
cages
and
in
the
cages
were
lions
and
tigers
and
monkeys
and
zebras
and
elephants
and
all
kinds
of
animals
there
were
birds
too
with
red
and
blue
plumage
and
beautiful
golden
tails
there
were
parrots
and
cockatoos
and
pheasants
wild
ducks
were
swimming
in
the
ponds
and
two
swans
sailed
like
lovely
white
ships
to
the
place
where
the
twins
stood
and
opened
their
bills
to
be
fed
in
the
sleeve
was
something
for
each
one
taro
and
take
took
turns
take
fed
the
swans
and
taro
fed
the
great
fish
that
swam
up
beside
them
and
looked
at
them
with
round
eyes
when
they
saw
the
food
the
fish
leaped
in
the
water
and
fought
each
other
to
get
it
and
when
they
ate
it
they
made
curious
noises
like
pigs
i
do
think
they
have
very
good
manners
said
take
by
and
by
they
came
to
a
queer
little
street
this
little
street
must
have
been
made
on
purpose
for
little
boys
and
girls
to
have
fun
in
for
there
were
all
sorts
of
astonishing
things
there
there
were
jugglers
doing
strange
tricks
with
tops
and
swords
there
were
acrobats
and
and
going
about
with
baskets
hung
from
long
poles
over
their
shoulders
it
was
almost
like
a
circus
the
street
was
full
of
people
and
every
one
was
gay
the
twins
and
their
father
had
gone
only
a
little
way
up
the
street
when
an
old
woman
met
them
she
had
a
pole
on
her
shoulder
and
from
it
swung
a
little
fire
of
coals
in
a
brazier
she
had
a
little
pot
of
batter
and
a
little
jar
of
sweet
sauce
a
ladle
a
griddle
and
a
would

like
to
make
some
cakes
she
said
to

she
said
the
father
gave
the
old
woman
some
money
out
of

set
the
brazier
on
the
ground
then
take

her
sleeves
back

the
griddle
on
the
coals

out
some
batter
and
cooked
a
little
cake

side
until

then
she
turned
it
over
with
the
and
browned
it
on
the
other
side
then
she
put
it
on
a
plate
and

my
but
it

her
father

all
up
then
he
said

the
kind
i

sure
your
honorable
brother

too
the
japanese

so
very
polite
that
they
often
call
each
other
honorable
in
that
way
they
even
call
things
that
they
use
honorable
too
so
take
said
very
politely
honorable
brother
would
you

of
my
poor
cakes
it
would
be
impolite
in
japan
to
call
anything
good
that
you
had
made
yourself
it
would
seem
like
praising
your
own
work
that
was
why
take
called
them
my
poor
cakes
i
should
like
a
cake
very
much
taro

gave
it
to
taro
taro

the
father
laughed

take
baked
a
cake
for
herself
and
ate
it
she
called
it
a
poor
cake
aloud
but
inside
she
thought
it
was
the
very
best
cake
that
any
one
ever
made
when
she
had
finished
she
and
taro
and
the
father
bowed
politely
to
the
old
woman
sayonara
they
said
that
means
the
old
woman
bowed
sayonara
she
called
to
them
the
twins
and
their
father
walked
on

soon
found
the
garden
in
it
were
many
tiny
pine
trees
like
theirs
at
home
there
were
little
plum
trees
and
bamboos
and
a
tiny
in
it
there
was
a
pond
with
a
little
bridge
too
oh

little
bells
on
the
plum
trees
this
would
be
the
very
garden

she
stooped
down
and
peeped
under
the
little
trees
let

she
said
to

a

taking
a
walk
in
my
garden
my
head

in
the
clouds
and
every
step
i
take
is
a
mile
long
she
picked
up
her
kimono
she
turned
her
little
nose
up
to
the
sky
and
took
a
very
long
step
taro
came
roaring
after
her
but
just
that
minute
take
clog
turned
on
her
foot
and
the
first
thing
she
knew
she
was
flat
on
her
stomach
on
the
bridge
she
forgot
that
lady
giants
did
roar
taro
was
roaring
already
their
father
was
ahead
of
them
he
jumped
right
up
in
the
air
when
he
heard
the
noise
he
was
used
to
such
sounds
from
the
twins
he
turned
back
what
is
the
matter
he
said
he
picked
take
up
and
set
her
on
her
feet
we
giants
sobbed
take
her
head
was
in
the
clouds
said
taro
it
is
well
even
for
giants
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
earth
when
they
are
out
walking
the
father
said

you

but

her
father
answered

all
right
if
we
go
to
your
castle
my
castle
cried
take
where
is
it
right
over
there
through
the
trees
he
pointed
to
it
the
twins
looked
they
saw
a
high
tower
would
you
like
to
climb
to
the
top
with
me
their
father
said
oh
yes
taro
cried
we
are
tired
or
broken
take
added
so
they
went
into
the
tower
and
climbed
and
climbed
and
climbed
it
seemed
as
if
the
dark
stairs
would
never
end
i
believe
the
tower
reaches
clear
to
the
sky
said
take
i
do
believe
it
has
any
top
at
all
said
taro
but
just
that
minute
they
came
out
on
an
open
platform
and
what
a
sight
they
saw
the
whole
city
was
spread
out
before
them
they
could
see
gray
roofs
and
green
trees
and
roadways
with
people
on
them
the
people
looked
about
as
big
as
ants
crawling
along
they
could
see
rivers
and
blue
ponds
and
canals
it
seemed
to
the
twins
that
they
could
see
the
whole
world
in
a
minute
the
father
said
look
look
over
there
against
the
sky
the
twins
looked
far
away
they
saw
a
great
lonely
it
was
very
high
and
very
pale
against
the
pale
blue
sky
the
top
of
it
was
rosy
as
if
the
sun
shone
on
it
the
shadows
were
blue
below
the
top
there
were
clouds
and
mists
the
mountain
seemed
to
rise
out
of
them
and
float
in
the
air
the
twins
clasped
their
hands
it
is
fuji
they
cried
both
together
yes

the
father
it
is
fuji

most
beautiful
mountain
in
the
world
by
and
by
take
said
i
do
feel
a
bit
like
a
giant
any
more
and
taro
said
neither
do
i
for
a
long
time
they
stood
looking
at
it
then
they
turned
and
crept
quietly
down
the
dark
stairs
holding
tight
to
their
father
hands
they
went
back
to
mother
and
grandmother
and
under
the
cherry
trees
we
must
take
the
baby
home
said
the
mother
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
it
growing
late

a
little
longer

taro

the
father
i
did
believe

single
other
nice
thing
could
happen
this
day

take
but
going
home
by
boat

be
nicer
than

already
on
his
way
to
the
landing

a
tied
to
the
wharf

whole
family

on

boatman

off
and
away
they
went
over
the
blue
waters
and
into
the
river
and
down
the
river
a
long
way
through
the
city
and
beyond
they
passed
where
men
and
women
in
great
round
hats
worked
away
standing
ankle
deep
in
water
there
were
fields
where
were
growing
there
were
little
brown
thatched
roofs
peeping
out
from
under
green
trees
there
were
glimpses
of
little
streets
in
tiny
villages
and
of
people
riding
in
a
queer
sort
of
basket
hung
from
a
pole
and
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
two
men
at
last
they
came
to
a
near
their
home
they
were
glad
to
see
the
familiar
roofs

and
take
raced
ahead
of
the
others
to
their
own
little
house
in
the
garden

so
many
clogs
there

sounds
of
talking
inside
the
house

chorus
of
voices

of
their
aunts
and

the
things

soft

cold
weather
each

close
up
to
their

beside
the
big
hibachi
the
mother
put
on
a
square
framework
of
iron
over

then
she

her
mother
oh

the
mother
i
am
a
most
unworthy
creature
as
compared

a
paragon
then

any
such
things

take
because
nobody
could
be
better
than
you
the
mother
laughed
wait
until
i
tell
you
about
the
paragons
then
you
see
how
very
very
good
they
were
she
said
once
there
was
a
paragon
he
was
only
a
little
boy
but
he
was
so
good
to
his
parents
oh
you
ca
think
how
good
he
was
he
was
only
six
years
old
he
was
a
beautiful
child
with
a
tender
fine
skin
and
bright
eyes
he
lived
with
his
parents
in
a
little
town
among
the
the
fields
were
so
wet
in
the
spring
that
there
were
millions
and
millions
of
mosquitoes
around
their
home
everybody
was
nearly
bitten
to
death
by
them
the
little
boy
saw
how
miserable
and
unhappy
his
parents
were
from
the
he
could
not
bear
to
see
his
dear
parents
suffer
so
every
night
he
lay
naked
on
his
mat
so
the
mosquitoes
would
find
his
tender
skin
and
bite
him
first
and
spare
his
father
and
mother
oh
my
said
take
how
brave
that
was
i
do
like
a
bit
you
do
like
any
better
do
you
taro
said
well
said
take
i
rather
the
beetle
should
bite
me
than
mother
well
now
maybe
you
be
a
paragon
yourself
sometime
the
mother
said
there
were
any
women
paragons
were
there
asked
taro
oh
yes
said
the
mother
once
there
was
a
young
girl
who
loved
her
father
dearly
and
honored
him
above
everything
in
the
world
as
a
child
should
once
she
and
her
father
were
in
a
jungle
and
a
tiger
attacked
them
the
young
girl
threw
herself
upon
the
tiger
and
clung
to
his
jaws
so
that
her
father
could
escape
did
the
tiger
eat
her
up
said
taro
i
suppose
he
did
the
mother
answered
was
it
very
noble
of
her
to
be
eaten
up
so
her
father
could
get
away
take
asked
oh
very
noble
said
the
mother
well
then
said
take
was
it
very
noble
of
the
father
to
run
away
and
let
her
stay
and
be
eaten
up
the
lives
of
women
are
not
worth
so
much
as
those
of
men
her
mother
answered
take
bounced
on
her
cushion
i
do
see
how
she
could
honor
a
man
who
was
so
mean
she
said
take
mother
held
up
her
hands
she
was
shocked
why
take
she
said
the
man
was
her
father
tell
us
another
said
taro
please
honored
mother
do
tell
me
about
any
more
paragons
said
take
her
mother
was
still
more
shocked
why
little
daughter
she
said
do
you
want
to
hear
about
the
paragon
that
lay
down
on
the
cold
cold
ice
to
warm
a
hole
in
it
with
his
body
so
he
could
catch
some
fish
for
his
cruel
stepmother
to
eat
no
if
you
please
dear
mother
said
take
because
all
the
paragons
had
such
horrid
parents
my
dear
little
girl
the
mother
said
you
must
not
say
such
dreadful
things
we
must
honor
and
obey
our
parents
no
matter
what
kind
of
persons
they
are
well
said
take
we
love
and
honor
you
and
our
father
you
are
so
good
and
kind
she
put
her
hands
on
the
matting
in
front
of
her
and
bowed
to
the
floor
before
her
mother
taro
saw
take
do
this
and
he
wanted
to
be
just
as
polite
as
she
was
so
he
rolled
over
on
his
cushion
and
bowed
to
the
floor
too
now
tell
us
about
the
begged
take
their
mother
began
once
upon
a
time
but
just
as
she
got
as
far
as
that
they
heard
a
little
sound
from
cushion
in
the
corner
and
the
covers
began
to
wiggle
there
awake
said
the
mother
i
must
take
care
of
him
now
the
must
wait
until
another
time
and
just
at
that
minute
bright
spots
of
sunshine
appeared
on
the
paper
screen
and
the
shadows
of
leaves
in
pretty
patterns
fluttered
over
it
the
sun
is
out
the
sun
is
out
cried
the
twins
they
ran
to
the
door
put
on
their
clogs
and
were
soon
dancing
about
in
the
bright
sunshine
take
birthday
take
birthday
taro
and
take
loved
their
birthdays
the
best
of
all
the
days
in
the
year
they
had
two
of
them
most
twins
have
only
one
birthday
between
them
but
japanese
twins
have
two
that
is
because
all
the
boys
in
japan
celebrate
their
birthdays
together
on
one
day
and
all
the
girls
celebrate
theirs
together
on
another
day
so
you
see
though
they
were
twins
taro
and
take
did
have
the
same
birthday
at
all
take
birthday
came
first
she
knew
days
beforehand
that
it
was
coming
for
every
once
in
a
while
she
would
say
to
her
mother
how
many
days
is
it
now
and
her
mother
always
knew
she
meant
how
many
days
is
it
to
my
birthday
one
morning
when
she
woke
up
take
said
only
six
days
more
the
next
morning
she
said
only
five
days
more
one
morning
she
jumped
out
of
bed
very
early
and
said
oh
it
it
begins
this
very
minute
taro
did
get
up
early
that
day
when
he
heard
take
singing
it
he
just
buried
his
nose
under
the
bedclothes
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
he
remembered
take
last
birthday
and
he
remembered
that
boys
seemed
to
be
in
the
way
that
day
they
were
asked
to
play
with
the
girls
and
they
would
have
done
it
anyway
because
the
girls
spent
the
whole
day
playing
with
dolls
taro
did
think
much
of
dolls
before
breakfast
her
father
took
take
out
to
the
kura
he
reached
up
to
the
high
shelf
and
brought
down
the
big
red
box
that
held
the
dolls
it
was
as
big
as
a
trunk
then
he
reached
down
another
box
and
carried
them
both
into
the
house
although
it
was
so
early
in
the
morning
the
mother
had
already

of

samurai
should
never
complain
no
matter
how
hard
his

no
of
course
not
take

before
they
were
dressed
the
mother
came
into
their

get
your

early
for
you
and
take
are
to

the

had
a
hot
bath
every
day
but
they
usually
took
it
before
going
to

the
was
in
a
little
room
by
itself
it
was
shaped
a
little
like
a
barrel
and
it
had
a
stove
set
right
in
the
side
of
it
to
heat
the
water
taro
went
to
the
bathroom
and
climbed
over
the
edge
of
the
tub
it
was
hard
to
get
up
because
the
tub
was
high
he
dropped
into
the
water
with
a
great
splash
take
and
her
mother
heard
the
splash
then
they
heard
something
else
they
heard
screams
shrieked
taro
take
me
out
take
me
out
i
boiled
the
mother
and
take
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
to
the
tub
head
just
showed
over
the
edge
his
mouth
was
open
the
tears
were
streaming
down
his
cheeks
and
the
air
was
full
of
ows
his
mother
reached
her
arm
down
into
the
water
it
is
so
very
hot
taro
she
said
i
can
bear
my
hand
in
it
ow
ow
said
taro
he
did
even
say
ow
ow
honorable
mother
as
one
might
have
thought
such
a
very
polite
boy
would
do
and
he
tried
to
get
both
feet
off
the
bottom
of
the
tub
at
the
same
time
the
mother
put
some
cold
water
into
the
tub
taro
stopped
screaming
oh

take
called
to
him
you
are
really
and
truly
boiled

sniffed
taro
i
as
red
as

red
dragon
i
think
my
skin
will
come
off
i
know
you

dreadfully
hurt
poor
taro

son
of
the
samurai
never

his
lot
the
water
was
cooler
now
taro
head
disappeared
below
the
edge
of
the
tub

splashed
a
minute
then
he
said

guess
a
real
truly
samurai
would
scream
a
little
if
he
were
boiled
his
words
made
a
big
round
sound
coming
out
of
the
tub
pretty
soon
it
was
take
turn
she
climbed
into
the
tub

stuck
her
head
over
the
edge
of
the
tub
i
boiled
too
she
called
to
taro
but
i
not
going
to
cry
then
the
water
is
hot

down
the
street
feeling
more
grown
up
than
they
ever
had
felt
in
all
their
lives
their

watched
them
from
the
when
they
turned

of

stood
together
in
a
row

and
take
were
at
the
end
the
moment
the
teacher
came
in
the
children
bowed
very
low
ohayo
they
called
please
make
your
honorable
entrance
they
drew
in
their
breath
with
a
hissing
sound
in
japan
this
is
a
polite
thing
to
do
the
teacher
bowed
to
the
children
then
each
child
ran
to
his
little
cushion
on
the
floor
and
sat
down
on
it
taro
and
take
did
not
know
where
to
go
because
they
had
not
been
to
school
before
the
teacher
gave
them
each
a
cushion
then
he
placed
beside
each
of
them
a
cunning
little
set
of
drawers
like
a
doll
bureau
in
the
little
bureau
were
india
ink
and
brushes
the
teacher
sat
down
on
his
cushion
before
the
school
he
told
the
children
where
to
open
their
books

could
even
find
the
place

o

it
for

teacher
gave

a
little
stick

with
the
little
stick
that
will
help
you
to
remember
it
he
began
to
read
taro
and
take
punched
each
letter
as
he
called
it
they
tried
so
hard
to
remember
that
they
punched
a
hole
right
through
the
paper
but
you
might
have
punched
something
too
if
you
had
thousands
of
letters
to
learn
that
what
taro
and
take
have
to
do
while
you
have
only
letters
they
were
glad
when
the
teacher
said
now

will
learn
how
to
count
taro
and
take
took
out
their
new
sorobans
the
teacher
showed
them
how
to
count
the
beads
they
thought
it
as
much
fun
as
a
game
then
they
tried
to
make
some
letters
in
their
with
a
brush
that
the
way
they
write
in
japan
taro
and
take
letters
were
very
big
and
and
the
paper
got
so
wet
that
the
teacher
said
children
you
may
all
carry
your
outdoors
and
hang
them
up
to
dry
and
you
may
eat
your
rice
out
of

and
their

her
rice
with

times
that
taro
and
take
have
but
they
have
so
many
holidays
and
such
good
times
on
every
one
of
them
that
it
would
take
two
books
to
tell
about
it
all
they
have
cherry
festivals
and
wistaria
festivals
and
chrysanthemum
festivals
when
everybody
goes
to

and
spends
the
whole
day
with
the
flowers
on
the
day
of
the
lotus
festival
they
go
very
early
in
the
morning
before
the
sun
is
up
to
a
pond
where
the
lotus
flowers
bloom
they
go
with
their
teacher
and
all
the
children
when
they
get
to
the
pond
the
teacher
says
listen
every
one
is
still
as
a
mouse
just
as
the
sun
comes
up
the
lotus
flowers
open
pop
pop
pop
they
go
like
fairy
guns
the
children
love
to
hear
them
pop
the
flowers
salute
the
sun
they
say
one
of
the
best
days
of
all
is
new
year
day
when
all
the
boys
and
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
fly
kites
and
such
wonderful
kites
the
air
is
full
of
dragons
and
boxes
and
all
sorts
of
queer
shapes
sometimes
the
dragons
have
a
battle
in
the
air
but
one
day
i
must
tell
you
about
anyway
and
that
is
birthday
it
is
only
taro
birthday
you
know
all
the
boys

even
if
they
are
your
very
own
twins
have
a
thing
to
do
with
it
and
it
lasts
five
days
on
the
first
morning
taro
woke
very
early
he
was
just
as
excited
as
take
was
on
the
day
of
the
festival
of
dolls
but
take
did
stay
in
bed
on
taro
birthday
she
flew
out
early
for
she
wanted
to
see
all
the
fun
even
if
she
was
in
it
first
she
went
to
the
kura
with
taro
and
their
father
to
get
out
the
flags
the
boys
birthday
is
called
the
feast
of
flags
they
took
with
them
to
the
kura
take
carried
him
on
her
back
it
birthday
too
she
said
so
he
must
go
in
the
kura
was
a
long
bamboo
pole
the
twins
father
took
the
pole
and
set
it
up
in
the
street
before
their
house
then
he
brought
out
two
great
paper
fish
they
were
almost
larger
than
taro
they
had
great
round
mouths
and
round
eyes
a
string
was
fastened
to
their
mouths
there
one
fish
for
taro
and
one
for
said
the
father
we
have
two
boys
in
our
house
he
tied
the
fish
to
the
pole
the
wind
filled
the
great
round
mouths
and
soon
away
up
in
the
air
the
two
fish
were
bobbing
and
blowing
about
just
as
if
they
were
alive
there
was
a
bamboo
pole
with
one
or
two
and
sometimes
three
or
four
fish
on
it
before
every
house
in
the
street
my
how
many
boys
there
are
in
the
world
take
said
more
than
i
can
count
the
street
was
as
gay
as
a
great
there
were
not
only
fish
flags
there
was
the
flag
of
japan
with
a
great
round
red
disk
on
it
and
there
was
the
flag
of
the
navy
which
was
a
great
round
red
sun
like
the
other
only
with
red
rays
around
it
and
there
were
banners
of
all
colors
waving
in
the
breeze
why
are
the
fish
flags
all
made
just
like
the
carp
in
the
pond
at
the
temple
asked
take
because
the
carp
is
such
a
plucky
fish
the
father
answered
he
is
a
lazy
fish
that
only
wants
to
swim
downstream
the
easy
way
he
swims
up
the
rivers
and
jumps
up
the
falls
the
way
we
want
our
japanese
boys
to
be
their
lives
must
be
brave
and
strong
like
the
carp
and
clean
and
bright
like
the
sword
too
taro
said
yes

his
father
i

remember
about
the
sword

then
he

they
went
down
the
street
with
all
the
boys
following
after
taro
and
take
did
not
go
with
them
because
their
mother
said
it
is
almost
time
for
supper
they
watched
the
others
from
their
gate
then
they
came
back
and
sat
down
on
the
top
step
of
the
porch
i
think
you
had
just
as
good
a
time
on
your
birthday
as
i
had
on
mine
take
said
better
said
taro
taro
we
are
getting
very
old
are
we
take
went
on
yes
said
taro
we
are
six
now
what
are
you
going
to
be
when
you
are
seven
or
eight
years
old
and
grown
up
asked
take
well
said
taro
i
not
sure
but
i
think
i
shall
be
either
a
general
or
a
juggler
taro
said
what
are
you
going
to
be
there
only
one
thing
i
can
grow
to
be
said
take
if
i
am
very
very
good
maybe
i
grow
to
be
a
sometime
just
then
they
heard
their
mother
voice
calling
them
to
supper
it
was
very
late
for
supper
it
was
really
almost
night
the
shadows
in
the
little
garden
were
growing
long
the
birds
were
chirping
sleepily
to
each
other
in
the
wistaria
vine
the
iris
flowers
were
nodding
their
purple
heads
to
the
little
goldfish
in
the
pond
everything
was
quiet
and
still
the
twins
stopped
to
look
at
the
little
garden
before
they
went
in
to
their
supper
good
night
pretty
world
they
said
and
waved
their
hands
the
end
suggestions
to
teachers
the
japanese
twins
is
a
story
which
gives
a
correct
picture
of
the
best
phase
of
japanese
home
life
like
its
predecessor
the
dutch
twins
the
aim
of
this
reader
is
to
foster
a
just
and
discriminating
respect
for
a
foreign
nation
in
whose
history
america
has
a
keen
interest
though
the
representatives
of
the
japanese
race
do
not
form
an
integral
part
of
our
national
life
as
those
of
the
dutch
and
many
other
nations
do
yet
the
sympathy
between
the
two
countries
is
strong
and
there
is
much
to
be
gained
by
a
knowledge
of
their
manners
customs
and
social
ideals
to
make
the
reading
of
this
story
most
valuable
as
a
school
exercise
it
is
suggested
that
children
be
allowed
at
the
outset
to
turn
the
pages
of
the
book
in
order
to
get
glimpses
of
taro
and
take
in
the
various
scenes
in
which
they
are
portrayed
in
the
illustrations
thus
arousing
their
interest
on
a
globe
or
a
map
of
the
world
point
out
japan
and
tell
the
children
something
about
the
unique
character
of
the
country
the
teacher
will
thus
find
no
difficulty
in
relating
this
supplementary
reading
material
to
the
work
in
geography
and
the
art
teacher
may
find
in
it
an
opening
for
further
illustration
of
japanese
ideas
of
art
and
architecture
the
text
is
so
simply
written
that
any
third
or
fourth
grade
child
can
read
it
without
much
preparation
in
the
third
grade
it
may
be
well
to
have
the
children
read
it
first
in
the
study
period
in
order
to
work
out
the
pronunciation
of
the
more
difficult
words
in
the
fourth
grade
the
children
can
usually
read
it
at
sight
without
the
preparatory
study
the
story
appeals
particularly
to
the
dramatic
tendencies
in
children
and
this
can
be
made
an
opportunity
for
lessons
in
courtesy
in
which
social
virtue
the
japanese
so
excel
the
use
of
the
material
for
language
and
constructive
work
is
also
immediately
apparent
in
connection
with
the
reading
of
the
book
have
children
read
selections
from
their
readers
and
other
books
about
japan
and
its
people
lafcadio
hearn
story
the
burning
of
the
rice
fields
in
the
riverside
third
reader
is
an
illustration
of
this
kind
of
collateral
reading
let
children
also
bring
to
class
postcards
and
other
pictures
illustrating
scenes
in
japan
the
unique
illustrations
in
the
book
should
be
much
used
both
in
the
reading
of
the
story
and
in
other
ways
children
will
enjoy
sketching
some
of
them
their
simple
treatment
makes
them
especially
useful
for
this
purpose
children
will
enjoy
also
making
jinrikishas
fans
parasols
sand
gardens
and
sand
pictures
where
possible
and
in
painting
the
japanese
flags
the
book
is
printed
on
paper
which
will
take
water
color
well
and
where
books
are
individually
owned
some
of
the
sketches
could
be
used
for
coloring
in
flat
washes
they
also
afford
suggestions
for
action
sketching
by
the
children
an
excellent
oral
language
exercise
would
be
for
the
children
after
they
have
read
the
story
to
take
turns
telling
the
story
from
the
illustrations
and
a
good
composition
exercise
would
be
for
each
child
to
select
the
illustration
that
he
would
like
to
write
upon
make
a
sketch
of
it
and
write
the
story
in
his
own
words
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
many
ways
that
will
occur
to
resourceful
teachers
for
making
the
book
a
valuable
as
well
as
an
enjoyable
exercise
in
reading
