chapter
i
for
hours
the
had
been
raging
unabated
over
new
york
after
a
wild
and
windy
thursday
night
the
world
had
awakened
to
a
mysterious
whirl
of
white
on
friday
morning
and
to
a
dark
strange
day
of
steady
snowing
now
on
saturday
dirty
snow
was
banked
and
heaped
in
great
blocks
everywhere
and
still
the
clean
new
flakes
fluttered
and
twirled
softly
down
powdering
and
feathering
every
little
ledge
and
sill
blanketing
areas
in
spotless
white
capping
and
hooding
every
unsightly
hydrant
and
with
exquisite
and
lavish
beauty
shovels
had
clinked
on
icy
sidewalks
all
the
first
day
and
even
during
the
night
the
sound
of
shouting
and
scraping
had
not
ceased
for
a
moment
and
their
more
and
more
obvious
helplessness
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
awakened
at
last
in
the
and
in
the
men
and
women
who
gasped
and
stumbled
along
the
choked
thoroughfares
a
sort
of
heady
exhilaration
in
the
emergency
a
tendency
to
be
proud
of
the
storm
and
of
its
effect
upon
their
humdrum
lives
they
laughed
and
shouted
as
they
battled
with
it
and
as
nature
great
barrier
of
snow
threw
down
the
little
barriers
of
convention
and
shyness
men
held
out
their
hands
to
slipping
and
stumbling
women
caught
them
by
their
shoulders
panted
to
them
that
this
was
a
storm
all
right
this
was
the
worst
yet
girls
staggering
in
through
the
revolving
glass
doors
of
the
big
department
stores
must
stand
laughing
helplessly
for
a
few
seconds
in
the
gush
of
reviving
warmth
while
they
beat
their
wet
gloves
together
regaining
breath
and
and
straightened
outraged
millinery
traffic
was
congested
deserted
trucks
and
lined
the
side
streets
the
subways
were
jammed
the
surface
cars
helpless
here
and
there
long
lines
of
the
omnibuses
stood
blocked
in
snow
and
the
press
frantically
heralded
impending
shortages
of
milk
and
coal
reiterating
pessimistically
no
relief
in
sight
but
late
in
saturday
morning
there
was
a
sudden
lull
the
snow
stopped
the
wind
fell
and
the
pure
cold
air
was
motionless
and
sweet
the
city
emerged
exhausted
from
its
temporary
blanketing
and
from
the
buried
benches
of
bowling
green
to
the
virgin
sweep
of
pure
white
beyond
van
cortlandt
park
began
its
usual
january
fight
with
the
snow
a
handsome
rosy
old
lady
wrapped
regally
in
furs
and
with
a
maid
picking
her
way
cautiously
beside
her
was
one
of
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
the
sudden
change
in
the
weather
melrose
had
been
held
captive
for
almost
two
days
first
by
thursday
inclement
winds
and
then
by
the
blizzard
her
was
useless
and
although
at
sixty
she
was
an
extremely
youthful
and
vigorous
woman
her
daughters
and
granddaughter
had
threatened
to
use
force
rather
than
let
her
risk
the
danger
of
an
expedition
on
foot
at
least
while
the
storm
continued
but
now
the
wind
was
gone
and
by
the
time
melrose
had
been
properly
shod
and
coated
and
hatted
there
was
even
a
dull
glimmer
toward
the
southeast
that
indicated
the
location
of
the
sun
the
old
lady
looked
her
approval
at
fifth
avenue
with
all
its
crudities
veiled
and
softened
by
the
snowfall
and
as
she
climbed
into
an
omnibus
expressed
herself
firmly
to
regina
you
mark
my
words
the
sun
will
be
out
before
we
come
home
regina
punching
the
two
dimes
carefully
into
the
jolting
receiver
made
only
a
respectful
murmur
for
answer
she
was
like
many
a
maid
a
snob
where
her
mistress
was
concerned
and
she
did
not
like
to
have
melrose
ride
in
public
omnibuses
for
regina
herself
it
did
not
matter
but
melrose
was
one
of
the
city
prominent
and
wealthy
women
and
regina
could
not
remember
that
she
had
ever
sunk
to
the
use
of
a
public
conveyance
before
the
maid
was
glad
when
they
descended
at
a
street
in
the
east
sixties
they
would
probably
be
sent
home
she
reflected
in
liggett
car
for
regina
noticed
that
private
cars
were
beginning
to
grind
and
slip
over
the
snow
again
old
melrose
was
going
to
see
her
daughter
alice
who
was
christopher
liggett
because
alice
was
an
invalid
it
had
been
only
a
few
years
after
alice
most
felicitous
marriage
a
dozen
years
ago
when
an
accident
had
laid
the
lovely
and
brilliant
woman
upon
the
bed
of
helplessness
that
she
might
never
leave
again
there
was
no
real
reason
why
the
spine
should
continue
useless
the
great
specialists
said
there
was
a
hope
even
a
probability
that
as
alice
grew
rested
and
strong
after
the
serious
accident
she
might
find
herself
walking
again
but
alice
had
been
a
prisoner
for
ten
years
now
and
the
mother
and
sister
who
idolized
her
feared
that
she
would
never
again
be
the
old
dancing
alice
and
feared
that
she
knew
it
what
christopher
liggett
feared
they
did
not
know
he
insisted
that
alice
illness
was
but
temporary
and
was
tireless
in
his
energetic
pursuit
of
treatment
for
his
wife
everything
must
be
hoped
and
everything
must
be
tried
and
mother
knew
that
one
of
the
real
crosses
of
her
daughter
life
was
sorrowful
pity
for
chris
optimistic
delusions
the
young
liggetts
had
sold
the
old
house
of
christopher
father
an
immense
brownstone
mansion
a
few
squares
away
and
lived
in
a
modern
house
that
rose
five
stories
from
the
beautifully
arranged
basement
entrance
there
were
stone
benches
at
the
entrance
and
a
great
iron
grill
and
two
potted
trees
and
the
small
square
windows
were
leaded
and
showed
blossoming
plants
inside
the
three
long
windows
above
gave
upon
a
formal
with
a
gothic
fireplace
of
white
stone
at
one
end
and
a
dim
jumble
of
rich
colours
and
polished
surfaces
between
that
and
the
big
piano
at
the
other
the
room
at
the
back
on
this
floor
was
an
equally
large
and
formal
gleaming
with
carved
mahogany
and
fretted
plate
used
only
on
the
rare
occasions
of
a
but
on
the
floor
above
the
gracious
mistress
of
the
house
had
her
domain
and
here
there
was
enough
beauty
and
colour
to
make
the
whole
house
live
the
front
room
cool
all
summer
because
it
faced
north
and
warm
all
winter
because
of
the
great
open
fireplace
that
augmented
the
furnace
heat
was
alice
comfortable
beautiful
and
exquisitely
ordered
none
of
the
usual
clutter
of
the
invalid
was
there
the
fireplace
was
of
plain
creamy
tiling
the
rugs
upon
a
dark
polished
floor
there
were
only
two
canvases
on
the
walls
and
the
six
or
seven
photographs
that
were
arranged
together
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
low
plain
bookcases
were
framed
alike
there
were
no
meaningless
vases
no
jars
or
trays
or
plaques
or
ornaments
in
alice
room
her
flowers
she
liked
to
see
in
shining
glass
bowls
her
desk
was
severely
bare
but
the
cretonne
that
dressed
her
big
comfortable
chairs
and
her
couch
was
bright
with
roses
and
parrots
and
hollyhocks
and
the
same
cretonne
with
plain
net
undercurtaining
hung
at
her
four
front
windows
the
room
was
big
enough
to
accommodate
besides
even
with
an
air
of
space
and
simplicity
the
little
grand
piano
that
christopher
played
for
her
almost
every
night
a
great
persian
cat
was
at
home
here
and
sometimes
alice
had
her
magnificent
parrot
besides
hanging
himself
upside
down
on
his
stand
and
veiling
the
beady
sharp
eye
with
which
he
watched
her
the
indulgent
extravagance
of
her
mother
had
bound
all
the
books
that
alice
loved
in
the
same
tone
of
vellum
the
countless
cushions
with
which
the
aching
back
was
so
skillfully
packed
were
of
the
same
dull
tone
and
it
pleased
the
persons
who
loved
her
to
amuse
the
prisoner
sometimes
with
a
ring
in
which
her
favourite
note
was
repeated
or
a
chain
of
old
that
made
alice
appreciative
blue
eyes
more
blue
back
of
alice
room
was
a
den
in
which
christopher
could
conduct
much
of
his
personal
business
and
beyond
that
was
the
luxurious
bathroom
a
modern
miracle
of
enamel
tiling
and
shining
glass
across
the
back
of
the
house
were
alice
little
bedroom
nunlike
in
its
rigid
austerity
her
nurse
room
adjoining
and
a
square
giving
glimpses
of
roofs
and
trim
full
of
flowers
with
a
little
fountain
and
goldfish
a
floor
of
dull
pink
tiling
and
plants
in
great
jars
of
chinese
enamel
christopher
had
planned
this
delightful
addition
to
alice
domain
only
a
few
years
ago
and
with
that
knowledge
of
her
secret
heart
that
only
christopher
could
claim
had
let
her
share
the
pleasure
of
designing
and
arranging
it
it
stretched
out
across
the
west
side
of
the
spacious
backyard
almost
touching
the
branches
of
the
great
plane
tree
and
when
after
the
painful
move
to
her
mother
house
and
the
necessary
absence
during
the
building
of
it
alice
had
been
brought
back
to
this
new
evidence
of
their
love
and
goodness
she
had
buried
her
face
against
christopher
shoulder
and
told
him
that
she
did
think
people
with
all
the
world
to
wander
in
had
ever
had
anything
lovelier
than
this
one
of
the
paintings
that
alice
might
look
at
idly
in
the
silence
of
the
winter
noon
was
of
a
daisied
meadow
stretching
between
walls
of
heavy
summer
woodland
to
the
roof
of
a
farmhouse
in
the
valley
below
the
other
picture
was
of
the
very
mother
who
was
coming
toward
alice
now
in
the
jolting
omnibus
but
it
was
a
younger
mother
and
a
younger
alice
that
had
been
captured
by
the
painter
genius
it
was
a
stout
imperious
magnificently
gowned
woman
of
not
much
more
than
thirty
in
whose
spreading
silk
lap
a
fair
little
girl
was
sitting
this
little
child
was
alice
at
seven
the
splendid
boy
of
about
fourteen
who
stood
beside
the
mother
was
teddy
her
only
son
dead
now
for
many
years
and
perhaps
mercifully
dead
the
fourth
and
last
person
pictured
was
the
elder
daughter
annie
who
had
been
about
nine
years
old
then
alice
remembered
annie
and
alice
had
been
unusually
alike
even
for
sisters
but
even
then
annie
fair
aristocratic
type
of
blonde
prettiness
had
been
definite
where
alice
was
vague
and
annie
expression
had
been
just
a
trifle
haughty
and
discontented
where
alice
was
always
grave
and
sweet
annie
had
almost
been
a
beauty
she
was
extremely
and
conspicuously
even
now
when
as
hendrick
von
behrens
wife
of
a
son
of
an
old
and
wealthy
knickerbocker
family
she
was
supreme
in
the
very
holy
of
holies
of
the
city
social
life
melrose
came
unannounced
upon
her
daughter
and
colourless
warm
cheek
flushed
with
happiness
under
her
mother
fresh
cold
kiss
mummy
you
darling
but
how
did
you
get
here
miss
slater
says
that
the
streets
are
absolutely
impassable
i
came
in
the
dear
melrose
said
very
much
pleased
with
herself
how
warm
and
comfy
you
are
in
here
darling
but
what
did
i
interrupt
you
did
interrupt
anything
alice
said
quickly
chris
telephoned
and
he
bringing
henrici
the
frenchman
who
wrote
that
play
i
loved
so
to
tea
is
that
fun
i
so
excited
and
i
think
chris
was
such
a
duck
to
get
hold
of
him
i
was
translating
it
you
know
and
bowditch
who
was
here
for
dinner
last
night
told
me
he
place
it
if
i
finished
it
and
now
i
can
talk
it
over
with
henrici
himself
thanks
to
chris
chris
met
my
man
at
the
club
and
told
him
about
me
and
he
said
he
would
be
charmed
so
i
telephoned
several
persons
and
i
tried
to
get
hold
of
annie
annie
has
a
lunch
and
a
board
meeting
at
the
hospital
at
four
annie
mother
remembered
and
leslie
is
at
a
girls
luncheon
somewhere
annie
had
breakfast
with
me
and
was
rushing
off
afterward
she
quite
wonderfully
faithful
about
those
things
well
but
you
stay
for
lunch
and
tea
too
mummy
alice
pleaded
she
was
lying
back
in
her
pillows
feasting
her
eyes
upon
her
face
with
that
peculiarly
tense
devotion
that
was
part
of
her
nature
rarely
did
a
day
pass
without
their
meeting
and
no
detail
touching
annie
life
annie
boys
or
husband
was
too
small
to
interest
alice
she
was
especially
interested
too
in
leslie
the
daughter
that
her
brother
theodore
had
left
to
his
mother
care
in
fact
between
the
mother
and
daughters
the
one
granddaughter
and
two
little
grandsons
and
the
two
of
the
melrose
family
a
deep
bond
existed
a
bond
of
pride
as
well
as
affection
it
was
one
of
their
favourite
boasts
that
to
the
melroses
the
unity
and
honour
of
the
family
was
the
first
consideration
in
the
world
but
melrose
could
not
stay
at
one
she
left
alice
to
be
put
into
her
prettiest
robe
by
the
devoted
miss
slater
saw
with
satisfaction
that
preparations
for
tea
were
noiselessly
under
way
called
regina
odorous
of
tea
and
mutton
chops
from
the
pantry
and
went
out
into
the
quiet
cold
of
the
winter
noon
the
old
melrose
house
was
a
substantial
roomy
brownstone
building
in
madison
avenue
inconspicuous
perhaps
among
several
notoriously
handsome
homes
but
irreproachably
dignified
none
the
less
a
few
blocks
below
it
the
commercial
current
of
east
street
ebbed
and
flowed
a
few
blocks
north
the
great
façade
of
the
grand
central
station
shut
off
the
street
completely
third
avenue
behind
it
swarmed
and
rattled
alarmingly
close
and
broadway
flared
its
impudent
signs
only
five
minutes
walk
in
the
other
direction
but
here
in
a
little
oasis
of
quiet
street
two
score
of
old
families
serenely
held
their
place
against
the
rising
tide
and
among
them
the
melroses
confidently
felt
themselves
valued
and
significant
melrose
mounted
her
steps
with
the
householder
secret
complacency
they
were
scrupulously
brushed
of
the
last
trace
of
snow
and
the
heavy
door
at
the
top
swung
noiselessly
open
to
admit
her
she
suddenly
realized
that
she
was
very
tired
that
her
fur
coat
was
heavy
and
her
back
ached
she
swept
straight
to
the
dark
old
curving
stairway
and
mounted
slowly
joseph
she
said
over
her
shoulder
send
luncheon
upstairs
please
and
when
miss
leslie
comes
in
tell
her
i
should
like
to
see
her
if
it
is
too
late
anybody
coming
von
behrens
telephoned
that
he
and
liggett
might
come
in
for
a
moment
on
his
way
to
the
banquet
at
the
waldorf
madam
but
that
was
all
i
may
have
dinner
upstairs
too
if
leslie
is
going
anywhere
melrose
said
to
herself
mounting
slowly
and
it
seemed
to
her
fatigue
very
restful
to
find
her
big
room
warm
and
orderly
her
coal
fire
burning
behind
the
steel
rods
all
the
homely
comfortable
treasures
of
her
busy
years
awaiting
her
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
regina
flew
noiselessly
about
with
slippers
and
a
loose
silk
robe
presently
a
maid
was
serving
bouillon
and
melrose
felt
herself
relaxed
and
soothed
it
was
good
to
be
home
yet
there
was
trace
of
uneasiness
of
something
almost
like
apprehension
in
the
look
that
wandered
thoughtfully
about
the
overcrowded
room
presently
she
reached
a
plump
hand
toward
the
bell
but
when
regina
came
to
stand
expectantly
near
her
melrose
roused
herself
from
a
profound
abstraction
to
assure
her
that
she
had
not
rung
it
must
have
been
a
mistake
miss
leslie
has
come
in
not
yet
madam
miss
melrose
is
at
miss
higgins
luncheon
yes
but
it
was
an
early
luncheon
the
grandmother
said
discontentedly
she
was
playing
squash
or
tennis
or
something
regina
yes
madam
but
melrose
was
musing
again
regina

am

caller

four
a
sheridan
please
see
that
she
is
shown
up
at
once
i
want
to
see
her
here
and
please
a
pause
regina
waited
that
all
her
mistress
announced
suddenly
alone
again
the
old
lady
stirred
her
tea
ruminated
for
a
few
moments
with
narrowed
eyes
fixed
on
space
recalled
herself
to
her
surroundings
and
finished
her
cup
her
room
was
large
filled
with
chairs
and
tables
lamps
and
cushions
silver
trays
and
lacquer
boxes
vases
and
jars
and
bowls
gift
books
and
current
magazines
there
was
not
an
unbroken
inch
of
surface
anywhere
the
walls
were
closely
set
with
pictures
of
all
sorts
along
the
mantel
a
scalloped
narrow
shelf
of
marble
was
a
crowding
line
of
photographs
in
silver
frames
and
there
were
other
framed
photographs
all
about
the
room
there
were
the
young
mothers
of
the
late
eighties
seated
to
best
display
their
bustles
and
their
french
twists
with
infants
in
their
tightly
cased
arms
and
there
were
children
pictures
babes
in
shells
in
swings
or
leaning
on
gates
there
were
three
annies
one
in
ringlets
plaid
silk
and
tasselled
boots
at
eight
one
magnificent
in
plumes
and
a
recent
one
a
cloudy
study
of
the
severely
superb
mother
with
a
boy
on
each
side
of
her
there
was
a
photograph
of
the
son
theodore
handsome
sullen
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
the
opening
century
and
there
was
more
than
one
of
daughter
the
last
of
the
melroses
leslie
had
been
a
sturdy
little
girl
who
carried
a
perpetually
surprised
even
a
babyish
expression
into
her
teens
but
her
last
pictures
showed
the
débutante
the
piquant
and
charming
whose
knowingly
tipped
hat
and
high
fur
collar
left
only
a
glimpse
of
pretty
and
pouting
face
between
leslie
came
in
upon
her
grandmother
at
about
three
she
was
genuinely
tired
after
an
athletic
morning
at
the
club
a
luncheon
amid
a
group
of
chattering
intimates
and
a
walk
with
the
young
man
whose
attentions
to
her
were
thrilling
not
only
her
grandmother
and
aunts
but
the
little
leslie
herself
acton
liggett
was
only
brother
only
relative
indeed
and
promised
already
to
be
as
great
a
favourite
as
the
irresistible
chris
himself
both
were
rich
both
straightforward
honourable
men
proud
of
their
own
integrity
their
family
and
their
old
firm
acton
was
pleasantly
at
home
in
the
melrose
liggett
and
von
behrens
houses
the
very
maids
loved
him
and
his
quiet
singling
out
of
leslie
for
his
devotion
had
satisfied
everyone
sense
of
what
was
fitting
and
delightful
pretty
leslie
back
from
a
summer
idling
with
aunt
annie
and
the
little
boys
in
california
and
hawaii
had
found
admiration
waiting
for
her
with
all
the
other
joys
of
her
débutante
winter
and
even
the
critical
aunt
annie
had
to
admit
that
the
little
minx
was
managing
the
whole
matter
with
consummate
skill
leslie
was
not
in
the
least
with
acton
she
turned
to
him
with
all
the
artless
confidence
of
a
little
sister
she
asked
him
about
her
dancing
partners
and
about
her
gowns
and
she
discussed
with
him
all
the
various
bits
of
small
gossip
that
concerned
their
own
friends
should
i
have
said
that
acton
she
would
ask
trustfully
shall
i
be
marion
bridesmaid
would
you
after
i
refused
linda
fox
you
know
i
do
like
to
dance
with
louis
davis
after
what
you
told
me
what
shall
i
do
when
he
comes
up
to
me
acton
was
seven
years
her
senior
he
advised
her
earnestly
over
many
a
confidential
cup
of
tea
and
just
lately
the
grandmother
noticed
exultantly
hardly
a
day
passed
that
did
not
find
the
young
couple
together
how
did
acton
happen
to
meet
you
lovey
she
asked
of
the
walk
why
he
telephoned
vesta
higgins
and
asked
me
how
i
was
going
to
get
home
i
said
walk
there
was
no
use
trying
anyway
for
they
were
slipping
and
bumping
terribly
he
said
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
he
came
up
granny
she
paused
and
her
grandmother
was
conscious
of
a
quickened
the
thoughtful
almost
tremulous
tone
was
not
like
giddy
little
leslie
granny
the
girl
repeated
presently
how
old
was
my
mother
when
she
got
married
about
the
old
woman
said
and
how
old
was
aunt
annie
when
she
did
annie
about
her
mother
considered
she
was
about
but
why
dear
nothing
said
leslie
and
fell
silent
she
was
still
in
the
silk
blouse
and
short
homespun
skirt
that
she
had
worn
at
the
athletic
club
luncheon
but
she
had
thrown
aside
her
loose
woolly
coat
and
the
narrow
furs
that
were
no
softer
than
her
own
fair
skin
flung
back
into
a
deep
chair
and
relaxed
after
her
vigorous
day
she
looked
peculiarly
childish
and
charming
her
grandmother
thought
she
was
like
both
her
aunts
with
annie
fair
almost
ashen
hair
and
alice
full
pretty
mouth
but
she
was
more
squarely
built
than
either
and
a
hint
of
a
tip
at
the
end
of
her
nose
gave
her
an
expression
at
once
infantile
and
astonished
when
leslie
opened
her
blue
eyes
widely
and
stared
at
anything
she
looked
like
an
amazed
baby
and
the
effect
of
her
round
eyes
and
tilted
nose
was
augmented
by
her
very
fair
skin
and
by
just
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
shortness
in
her
upper
lip
of
course
she
knew
all
this
her
acquaintance
with
her
own
good
and
bad
points
had
begun
in
school
days
and
while
through
her
grandmother
care
her
teeth
were
being
straightened
and
her
eyes
and
throat
subjected
to
mild
forms
of
surgery
her
aunt
annie
had
seen
to
it
that
her
masses
of
fair
hair
had
been
burnished
and
groomed
her
hands
scraped
and
polished
into
beauty
and
finally
that
her
weight
was
watched
with
scrupulous
care
nature
had
perhaps
intended
leslie
to
be
plump
and
ruddy
but
modern
fashion
had
decreed
otherwise
and
with
half
the
girls
of
her
own
age
and
set
leslie
took
saccharine
in
her
tea
rarely
touched
sweets
or
fried
food
and
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
was
actually
too
slim
and
too
willowy
for
her
height
and
interestingly
colourless
into
the
bargain
could
acton
possibly
have
said
anything
definite
to
start
this
unusual
train
of
thought
the
grandmother
speculated
with
leslie
so
felicitously
married
she
would
have
felt
ready
for
her
she
watched
leslie
expectantly
but
the
girl
was
apparently
dreaming
and
was
staring
absently
at
the
tip
of
one
sturdy
oxford
above
which
a
stretch
of
thick
white
woollen
stocking
was
visible
almost
to
her
knee
how
can
they
fall
in
love
with
them
dressed
like
welsh
peasants
the
grandmother
said
to
herself
in
mild
disapproval
and
aloud
she
said
ah
do
lovey
for
leslie
had
taken
out
a
small
gold
case
and
was
regarding
it
thoughtfully
my
first
on
my
honour
leslie
said
as
she
lazily
lighted
a
cigarette
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
pay
any
attention
to
her
grandmother
protest
for
grandmother
had
been
regularly
protesting
against
everything
leslie
had
done
since
her
adored
and
despotic
childhood
she
had
fainted
when
leslie
had
dived
off
the
dock
at
newport
and
had
wept
when
leslie
had
galloped
through
the
big
iron
gates
on
her
own
roan
stallion
she
had
called
in
christopher
as
leslie
guardian
when
leslie
at
fifteen
had
calmly
climbed
into
one
of
the
big
cars
and
driven
it
seven
miles
alone
and
unadvised
and
totally
without
instruction
or
experience
leslie
knew
that
this
and
opposition
was
one
of
her
grandmother
secret
satisfactions
and
she
combatted
it
only
mechanically
have
one
grandma
have
one
you
wild
girl
you
i
like
to
know
what
a
nice
young
man
thinks
when
a
refined
girl
offers
him
all
the
nice
young
men
are
smoking
themselves
like
chimneys
ah
but
that
a
very
different
thing
no
my
dear
no
man
whether
he
smokes
himself
or
not
likes
to
have
a
sweet
womanly
girl
descend
darling
did
you
ever
do
anything
that
my
revered
murison
disapproved
of
leslie
teased
dropping
on
her
knees
before
her
grandmother
and
resting
her
arms
on
her
lap
smoke
my
mother
would
have
fainted
said
melrose
and
blow
that
stuff
in
my
face
but
she
could
not
resist
the
pleasure
that
the
lovely
young
face
so
near
her
own
gave
her
and
she
patted
it
with
her
soft
wrinkled
hand
suddenly
leslie
jumped
up
eagerly
listening
to
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
hall
there
aunt
annie
oh
goody
i
wanted
to
ask
her
but
it
was
regina
who
opened
the
door
showing
in
two
callers
the
first
was
a
woman
of
perhaps
with
a
rosy
cheerful
face
and
wide
shrewd
gray
eyes
shining
under
a
somewhat
shabby
mourning
veil
with
her
was
a
pretty
girl
of
eighteen
or
perhaps
a
little
more
leslie
glanced
astonished
at
her
grandmother
it
was
extremely
unusual
to
have
callers
shown
in
in
this
unceremonious
fashion
even
if
she
had
been
rather
unprepossessed
by
these
particular
callers
the
younger
woman
clothing
indeed
if
plain
was
smart
and
simple
her
severe
had
a
collar
of
beaver
fur
to
relieve
its
dark
blue
and
her
little
hat
of
blue
beaver
felt
was
trimmed
only
by
a
band
of
the
same
fur
she
had
attractive
eyes
and
a
flashing
smile
but
her
companion
comfortable
dowdiness
her
black
cotton
gloves
her
squarely
built
figure
and
worn
shoes
all
awakened
a
certain
contempt
in
the
granddaughter
of
the
house
and
caused
leslie
shrewdly
to
surmise
that
these
humble
strangers
were
pensioners
of
her
grandmother
the
older
one
probably
an
old
servant
kate
sheridan
old
melrose
had
gotten
to
her
feet
and
had
put
her
arm
about
the
visitor
well
my
dear
my
dear
i
not
seen
you
these
what
is
it
do
tell
me
how
many
years
it
is
and
which
daughter
is
this
this
is
my
niece
norma
the
older
woman
said
in
a
delightful
rich
voice
that
was
full
of
easy
confidence
and
friendliness
this
is
melrose
norma
darling
that
was
such
a
good
friend
to
me
and
mine
years
ago
no
warmer
friend
than
you
were
to
me
kate
the
old
lady
said
quickly
still
keeping
an
arm
about
the
sturdy
figure
this
is
my
granddaughter
theodore
little
girl
melrose
added
catching
leslie
with
her
free
hand
leslie
was
not
more
of
a
snob
than
is
natural
to
a
girl
of
her
age
and
upbringing
but
she
could
not
but
give
sheridan
a
pretty
cool
glance
grandmother
old
friends
were
all
very
well
but
sheridan
was
studying
her
with
affectionate
freedom
and
is
she
miss
alice
image
but
she
like
you
all
she
like
theodore
too
especially
through
the
eyes
and
she
turned
back
to
her
hostess
interested
animated
and
as
oblivious
to
leslie
hostile
look
as
if
the
girl
were
her
own
picture
on
the
wall
and
you
and
my
norma
must
know
each
other
she
said
presently
watching
the
girls
as
they
shook
hands
with
a
world
of
love
and
solicitude
in
her
eyes
sit
down
both
you
two
melrose
said
leslie
glanced
at
the
strapped
watch
at
her
wrist
grandmother
i
really
she
began
no
you
do
really
her
grandmother
smiled
talk
to
miss
sheridan
while
i
talk
she
turned
smiling
to
her
old
friend
to
kate
tell
me
how
are
you
all
kate
and
where
are
you
all
you
were
in
detroit
we
been
in
new
york
more
than
two
years
now
and
why
i
have
been
to
see
you
before
perhaps
can
tell
me
for
ca
kate
sheridan
said
but
my
boy
is
a
great
big
fellow
now
and
rose
is
and
this
one
she
nodded
toward
norma
who
was
exchanging
comments
on
the
great
storm
with
leslie
this
one
is
nearly
nineteen
and
you
see
they
all
working
wolf
doing
wonderfully
with
a
firm
of
machine
manufacturers
in
newark
and
rose
has
been
with
one
real
estate
firm
since
we
came
and
norma
here
works
in
a
bookstore
up
the
avenue
a
bit
biretta
why
i
go
in
there
nearly
every
week
the
old
lady
said
she
told
me
the
other
night
that
she
had
been
selling
some
books
to
christopher
liggett
and
that
miss
alice
husband
i
hear
said
sheridan
she
in
what
they
call
the
old
book
room
she
added
lowering
her
voice
she
wonderful
about
books
reads
them
and
knows
them
as
if
they
were
children
they
think
the
world
of
her
in
there
and
i
keep
house
for
the
three
of
them
and
what
with
this
and
that
i
never
have
any
time
but
you
have
someone
to
help
you
kate
the
old
lady
asked
with
her
amused
and
affectionate
eyes
on
the
other
wholesome
face
why
would
i
demanded
sheridan
roundly
the
girls
are
a
great
help
she
always
assumes
a
terrific
brogue
the
minute
you
ask
her
why
we
do
have
someone
in
to
help
her
norma
contributed
with
a
sort
of
shy
and
loving
audacity
she
tell
you
in
a
minute
that
faith
she
and
her
sister
used
to
run
barefoot
over
the
primroses
and
they
blooming
beyond
anything
the
lord
ever
created
and
the
spring
on
them
leslie
melrose
laughed
out
suddenly
in
delighted
appreciation
and
the
tension
between
the
two
girls
was
over
they
had
not
quite
known
how
to
talk
to
each
other
norma
naturally
assuming
that
leslie
looked
down
upon
a
seller
of
books
and
anxious
to
show
her
that
she
was
unconscious
of
either
envy
or
inferiority
and
leslie
at
a
loss
because
her
usual
social
chatter
was
as
foreign
here
as
a
strange
tongue
would
be
but
no
type
is
quicker
to
grasp
upon
amusement
and
to
appreciate
the
amuser
than
leslie
unable
to
amuse
itself
and
skilled
in
seeking
for
entertainment
she
was
too
shy
to
ask
norma
to
imitate
her
aunt
again
but
her
stiffness
relaxed
and
she
asked
norma
if
it
was
not
great
fun
to
sell
things
especially
at
christmas
for
instance
norma
asked
in
turn
if
liggett
was
not
leslie
uncle
and
said
that
she
had
sold
him
hundreds
of
beautiful
books
for
his
wife
and
had
even
had
a
note
from
leslie
aunt
alice
thanking
her
for
some
little
courtesy
but
is
that
funny
leslie
said
with
her
childish
widening
of
the
eyes
that
you
should
know
chris
well
now
said
sheridan
voice
cutting
across
both
conversations
where
can
these
girls
go
for
about
fifteen
minutes
tell
you
my
little
bit
of
business
melrose
and
then
norma
and
i
will
go
along
it
wo
take
me
fifteen
minutes
for
there
nothing
to
decide
the
girls
heard
her
add
comfortably
as
they
went
into
the
hall
leslie
her
grandmother
called
after
her
if
you
must
change
dear
but
wait
a
minute
is
that
aunt
annie
out
there
no
grandma
just
ourselves
what
were
you
going
to
say
i
was
going
to
say
lovey
that
you
could
ask
miss
sheridan
to
wait
in
the
library
her
aunt
tells
me
she
is
fond
of
books
melrose
did
not
quite
like
to
commit
leslie
to
entertaining
the
strange
girl
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
she
was
pleasantly
reassured
by
leslie
answering
voice
we
have
tea
in
my
room
grandma
marion
and
doris
may
come
in
that
right
have
a
good
time
her
grandmother
answered
and
then
settling
back
comfortably
she
added
with
her
kind
fussy
superiority
well
kate
i
wondered
where
you
were
hiding
yourself
all
this
time
let
have
the
business
but
first
i
want
to
say
that
i
appreciate
your
turning
to
me
if
it
money
i
got
it
if
it
something
else
chris
liggett
is
one
of
the
cleverest
men
in
new
york
and
we
consult
him
it
not
money
thank
god
sheridan
said
in
her
forthright
voice
lord
knows
where
it
all
comes
from
these
days
but
the
children
always
have
plenty
she
added
glad
of
a
diversion
they
bought
themselves
a
car
two
years
ago
and
if
it
is
a
victrola
this
week
it
a
thermos
bottle
or
a
pair
of
white
buckskin
shoes
rose
told
me
she
paid
eight
dollars
for
her
corsets
dollars
for
what
i
said
dozen
but
then
i
the
two
houses
in
brooklyn
you
know
you
still
have
those
i
have
indeed
and
even
the
baby
we
call
norma
the
baby
is
earning
good
money
now
she
has
your
name
kate
sheridan
had
your
husband
a
brother
kate
sheridan
face
grew
a
trifle
pale
she
glanced
at
the
door
to
see
that
it
was
shut
and
at
the
one
to
the
adjoining
room
to
make
sure
that
it
was
closed
also
then
she
turned
to
melrose
and
it
was
an
anxious
glance
she
directed
at
the
older
woman
well
now
there
no
hurry
about
this
she
began
and
you
may
say
that
it
all
nonsense
and
send
me
packing
and
god
knows
i
hope
you
will
but
it
just
began
to
get
on
my
mind
and
i
never
been
a
great
one
to
worry
i
begin
at
the
beginning
chapter
ii
marion
duer
and
doris
alexander
duly
arrived
for
tea
with
leslie
and
norma
was
introduced
they
all
sat
in
leslie
room
and
laughed
as
they
reached
for
crumpets
and
marvelled
at
the
storm
norma
found
them
rather
younger
than
their
years
and
shyly
anxious
to
be
gracious
on
her
part
she
realized
with
some
surprise
that
they
were
not
really
unapproachable
and
that
leslie
was
genuinely
anxious
to
take
her
to
tea
with
aunt
alice
some
day
and
have
them
talk
books
and
things
the
barriers
between
such
girls
as
this
one
and
herself
norma
was
honest
enough
to
admit
were
largely
of
her
own
imagining
they
were
neither
so
contemptibly
helpless
nor
so
scornfully
clever
as
she
had
fancied
them
they
were
just
laughing
girls
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
gowns
and
admirers
and
good
times
like
her
cousin
rose
and
herself
there
had
been
perhaps
one
chance
in
one
hundred
that
she
and
leslie
melrose
might
at
once
become
friends
but
by
fortunate
accident
that
chance
had
favoured
them
leslie
spontaneous
laugh
in
room
her
casual
mention
of
tea
her
appreciative
little
phrases
as
she
introduced
to
marion
and
doris
the
young
lady
who
picked
out
books
for
aunt
alice
had
all
helped
to
crush
out
the
vaguely
hostile
impulse
norma
sheridan
had
toward
rich
little
members
of
a
society
she
only
knew
by
hearsay
norma
had
found
herself
sitting
on
leslie
big
velvet
couch
laughing
and
chatting
quite
naturally
and
where
norma
chatted
naturally
the
day
was
won
she
could
be
all
friendliness
and
all
sparkle
and
fun
and
presently
leslie
was
listening
to
her
in
actual
fascination
the
butler
announced
a
a
maid
came
up
doris
and
marion
had
to
go
leslie
and
norma
went
into
leslie
and
maid
went
obsequiously
to
and
fro
and
the
girls
talked
almost
intimately
as
they
washed
their
hands
and
brushed
their
hair
neither
cared
that
the
time
was
passing
but
the
time
was
passing
none
the
less
five
came
with
a
pale
and
uncertain
sunset
and
a
cold
twilight
began
to
settle
over
the
snowy
city
leslie
and
norma
came
back
to
the
fire
and
were
standing
there
a
trifle
uncertainly
but
still
talking
hard
and
fast
when
there
was
an
interruption
they
looked
at
each
other
paling
what
was
that
there
was
utter
silence
in
the
old
house
leslie
with
a
frightened
look
at
norma
ran
to
the
hall
door
as
she
opened
it
sheridan
opened
the
door
of
her
grandmother
room
opposite
and
called
quite
loudly
it
nothing
dear
get
hold
of
your
grandmother
maid
somebody
she
feels
a
little
but
she
quite
all
right
leslie
and
norma
ran
across
the
hall
and
into
melrose
room
by
this
time
regina
had
come
flying
in
and
two
of
the
younger
maids
and
joseph
had
run
upstairs
leslie
had
only
one
glimpse
of
her
grandmother
leaning
against
regina
arm
and
drinking
from
a
glass
of
water
that
shook
in
the
maid
hands
then
sheridan
guided
both
herself
and
norma
firmly
into
the
hall
and
reassured
them
cheerfully
the
room
was
very
hot
dear
and
your
grandmother
said
that
she
had
gotten
tired
walking
in
the
wind
she
quite
all
right
you
can
go
in
immediately
no
she
did
faint
she
just
had
a
moment
of
dizziness
and
called
out
regina
came
out
too
evidently
convinced
that
she
had
to
deal
with
a
murderess
and
coldly
asked
that
sheridan
would
please
step
back
for
a
minute
sheridan
immediately
complied
but
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
minute
when
she
joined
the
girls
again
she
wants
to
see
you
dear
she
said
to
leslie
whose
first
frightened
tears
had
dried
from
bewilderment
and
curiosity
and
we
must
hurry
on
come
norma
we
say
miss
melrose
norma
said
leslie
answered
hesitating
over
the
name
her
wide
babyish
smile
the
more
appealing
because
of
her
wet
lashes
made
a
sudden
impression
upon
norma
heart
leslie
hung
childishly
on
the
upstairs
balustrade
in
the
dim
wide
upper
hall
and
watched
them
go
i
i
almost
called
you
norma
she
confessed
mischievously
i
wish
you
had
norma
called
up
from
below
she
was
in
great
spirits
as
they
went
out
into
the
deepening
cold
blue
of
the
street
and
almost
persuaded
her
aunt
to
take
the
omnibus
up
the
avenue
but
sheridan
protested
rather
against
this
extravagance
they
were
close
to
the
subway
and
that
was
quicker
norma
could
not
talk
in
the
packed
and
swaying
train
and
when
they
emerged
at
street
they
had
only
one
slippery
cold
dark
block
to
walk
but
when
they
had
reached
the
flat
and
snapped
on
lights
everywhere
and
cast
off
outer
garments
aproned
and
busy
in
the
kitchen
she
burst
out
what
on
earth
was
the
matter
with
that
old
lady
aunt
kate
oh
i
suppose
they
all
eat
too
much
and
sleep
too
much
and
pamper
themselves
as
if
they
were
babies
her
aunt
returned
composedly
and
so
it
does
take
much
to
upset
oh
come
now
the
girl
said
stopping
with
arrested
knife
that
was
what
made
her
let
out
a
yell
like
that
sheridan
kneeling
at
the
oven
of
the
gas
stove
laughed
uneasily
oh
you
could
hear
that
could
you
hear
it
they
heard
it
in
yonkers
well
sheridan
said
she
has
always
been
that
one
i
remember
years
ago
she
be
going
into
crying
and
raving
fits
got
very
deep
affections
melrose
and
when
she
gets
thinking
of
theodore
and
of
alice
accident
and
this
and
that
she
go
right
off
the
handle
she
had
been
crying
poor
soul
and
suddenly
she
began
this
moaning
and
rocking
i
told
her
i
call
someone
if
she
stop
for
she
go
from
bad
to
worse
with
me
but
why
with
you
aunt
kate
do
you
know
her
so
well
do
i
know
them
sheridan
dug
an
opener
into
a
can
of
corn
with
a
vigorous
hand
i
know
them
all
but
how
was
that
norma
persisted
now
dropping
her
peeled
potatoes
into
dancing
hot
water
i
told
you
five
thousand
times
but
you
and
rose
would
likely
have
one
of
your
giggling
fits
on
and
not
a
word
would
you
remember
her
aunt
said
i
told
you
that
years
ago
when
your
uncle
tom
died
and
i
was
left
with
two
babies
and
not
much
money
a
friend
of
mine
a
milliner
she
was
told
me
that
she
knew
a
lady
that
wanted
someone
to
help
manage
her
affairs
household
affairs
well
i
often
helped
your
uncle
tom
with
his
books
and
my
mother
was
with
me
to
look
out
for
the
children
where
was
i
aunt
kate
you
wolf
was
but
three
and
rose
a
year
old
where
would
you
be
i
was
minus
two
years
norma
said
sententiously
i
was
part
of
the
cosmic
all
you
be
very
careful
how
you
talk
about
such
things
until
you
a
married
woman
her
aunt
said
salt
those
potatoes
darling
norma
can
you
remember
what
i
did
with
the
corn
that
rose
liked
so
norma
was
attentive
you
beat
it
up
with
eggs
and
it
came
out
a
sort
of
puff
she
recalled
i
know
you
put
a
little
cornstarch
in
to
give
it
body
listen
aunt
kate
how
long
did
you
stay
with
mrs
melrose
well
first
i
just
watched
her
help
for
her
and
paid
the
bills
and
went
to
market
and
then
i
got
gradually
managing
more
and
more
i
go
to
pay
her
interest
or
deposit
money
or
talk
to
tenants
i
liked
it
and
she
liked
me
and
then
she
talked
me
into
going
to
france
with
her
but
i
cried
all
the
way
for
my
children
and
i
was
glad
enough
to
come
home
again
she
and
miss
annie
spent
some
time
over
there
but
i
came
back
miss
alice
was
in
school
and
theodore
dear
knows
where
he
was
into
some
mischief
somewhere
but
i
saved
money
and
she
given
me
the
brooklyn
houses
and
i
took
a
boarder
or
two
and
that
was
the
last
i
ever
worked
for
any
one
but
my
own
well
that
a
nice
girl
that
leslie
norma
said
if
her
father
wild
her
mother
was
a
good
girl
kate
said
i
knew
her
but
the
old
lady
was
proud
baby
god
save
any
one
of
us
from
pride
like
that
never
know
it
to
see
her
now
but
she
was
very
proud
theodore
wife
was
a
good
girl
but
she
was
miss
annie
maid
and
what
melrose
never
could
forgive
was
that
when
she
ordered
the
girl
out
of
the
house
she
showed
her
her
wedding
certificate
she
was
theodore
melrose
fast
enough
though
his
mother
never
would
see
her
or
acknowledge
her
in
any
way
they
must
think
the
lord
has
made
a
special
arrangement
for
them
people
like
that
norma
commented
turning
a
lovely
flushed
face
from
the
pan
where
she
was
dexterously
crisping
bacon
what
business
is
it
of
hers
if
her
son
marries
a
working
girl
that
gives
me
a
feeling
akin
to
pain
just
because
she
happens
to
have
a
lot
of
money
what
does
miss
leslie
melrose
think
of
that
i
do
know
what
she
thinks
she
loves
her
grandmother
i
suppose
melrose
took
her
in
when
she
was
only
a
tiny
girl
and
she
been
the
apple
of
her
eye
ever
since
theodore
and
his
wife
were
divorced
and
when
leslie
was
about
four
or
five
he
came
back
to
his
mother
to
die
poor
fellow
it
was
a
terrible
sorrow
to
the
old
lady
she
had
her
share
one
way
and
another
my
goodness
norma
sheridan
interrupted
herself
to
say
in
appreciation
i
wish
you
always
help
me
like
this
my
dear
you
can
be
as
useful
as
ten
girls
when
you
a
mind
to
and
then
perhaps
you
be
as
contrary
oh
aunt
kate
are
you
ashamed
when
i
ironed
all
your
last
night
when
you
were
setting
bread
and
i
made
the
popovers
sunday
norma
kissed
her
aunt
brushed
a
dab
of
cornstarch
from
the
older
woman
firm
cheek
and
performed
a
sort
of
erratic
dance
about
the
protestant
and
solid
figure
i
a
poor
working
girl
she
said
and
i
get
dragged
out
with
my
long
hard
day
well
god
knows
that
true
too
her
aunt
said
with
a
sudden
look
of
compunction
you
may
make
a
joke
of
it
but
it
no
life
for
a
girl
my
dear
she
added
seriously
holding
norma
with
a
firm
arm
and
looking
into
her
eyes
i
hope
i
did
no
harm
by
what
i
did
i
did
it
for
the
best
whatever
comes
of
it
you
mean
stirring
up
the
whole
thing
norma
asked
frowning
a
little
in
curiosity
and
bewilderment
going
to
see
her
that
yes
sheridan
rubbed
her
forehead
with
her
hand
a
fashion
she
had
when
puzzled
or
troubled
and
suddenly
resumed
with
a
great
rattling
of
pans
and
hissing
of
water
her
operations
at
the
sink
well
nothing
may
come
of
it
we
see
she
added
briskly
norma
who
was
watching
her
expectantly
sighed
disappointedly
the
subject
was
too
evidently
closed
but
a
second
later
she
was
happily
distracted
by
the
slamming
of
the
front
door
wolf
and
rose
sheridan
had
come
in
together
and
dinner
was
immediately
served
norma
recounted
with
her
own
spirited
embellishments
her
adventures
of
the
afternoon
as
the
meal
progressed
she
had
had
fun
getting
to
the
office
in
the
first
place
a
man
had
helped
her
and
they
had
both
skidded
into
another
man
and
bing
they
had
all
gone
down
on
the
ice
together
and
then
at
the
shop
nobody
had
come
in
and
the
lights
had
been
lighted
and
the
clerks
had
all
gathered
together
and
talked
then
aunt
kate
had
come
in
to
have
lunch
and
to
have
norma
go
with
her
to
the
gas
company
office
about
the
disputed
charge
and
they
had
decided
to
make
at
last
that
call
on
the
melroses
there
followed
a
description
of
the
big
house
and
the
spoiled
pretty
girl
and
the
impressive
yet
friendly
old
lady
and
aunt
kate
i
sorry
to
say
talked
her
into
a
nervous
convulsion
you
did
aunt
kate
the
poor
old
lady
gave
one
piercing
yell
you
awful
girl
there
be
a
judgment
on
you
for
your
impudence
her
aunt
said
fondly
but
rose
looked
solicitously
at
her
mother
and
said
mother
looks
as
if
she
had
had
a
nervous
convulsion
too
you
look
terribly
tired
mother
well
i
had
a
little
business
to
discuss
with
melrose
sheridan
said
and
i
no
hand
for
business
you
know
it
wolf
sheridan
concurred
with
his
ready
laugh
why
did
you
send
me
it
was
her
business
lovey
his
mother
said
mildly
over
her
second
heartening
cup
of
strong
black
tea
the
sheridan
apartment
was
in
exterior
at
least
exactly
like
one
hundred
thousand
others
that
line
the
side
streets
of
new
york
it
faced
the
familiar
grimy
street
fringed
on
the
great
arteries
each
side
by
cigarette
stands
and
saloons
and
it
was
entered
by
the
usual
flight
of
stained
and
shabby
steps
its
doorway
showing
a
set
of
some
dozen
and
looking
down
upon
a
basement
entrance
frequently
embellished
with
and
and
just
at
present
with
banks
of
soiled
and
sooty
snow
the
sheridans
climbed
three
long
flights
inside
to
their
own
rooms
but
as
this
gained
them
a
glimpse
of
river
and
a
sense
in
summer
of
airiness
and
height
to
say
nothing
of
pleasant
nearness
to
the
roof
they
rarely
complained
of
the
stairs
in
fact
rarely
thought
of
them
at
all
with
the
opening
of
their
own
door
however
all
likeness
to
their
neighbours
ceased
even
in
a
class
where
home
ties
and
home
comforts
are
far
more
common
than
is
generally
suspected
kate
sheridan
was
exceptional
and
her
young
persons
fortunate
among
their
kind
her
training
had
been
she
used
to
tell
them
old
country
training
but
it
was
not
only
in
fresh
linen
and
hot
good
food
that
their
advantage
lay
it
was
in
the
great
heart
that
held
family
love
a
divine
gift
that
had
stood
between
them
and
life
cold
realities
for
some
twenty
courageous
years
kate
idolized
her
own
two
children
and
her
with
a
passion
that
is
the
purest
and
the
strongest
in
the
world
in
possessing
them
she
thought
herself
the
most
blessed
of
women
to
keep
a
roof
over
their
heads
to
watch
them
progress
triumphantly
through
long
division
and
measles
and
skates
to
see
milk
glasses
emptied
and
plates
scraped
to
realize
that
wolf
was
as
strong
morally
as
he
was
physically
and
that
all
her
teachers
called
rose
an
angel
to
spoil
and
adore
the
beautiful
mischievous
and
amusing
baby
this
made
a
life
full
to
the
brim
for
kate
of
pride
and
happiness
kate
had
never
had
a
servant
or
a
fur
coat
for
long
intervals
she
had
not
had
a
night
unbroken
rest
and
there
had
been
times
when
wolf
fractured
arm
necessitated
a
doctor
bill
or
when
coal
for
the
little
detroit
house
had
made
a
disproportionate
hole
in
her
bank
account
in
which
even
the
thrifty
kate
had
known
biting
financial
worry
but
the
children
never
knew
it
they
knew
only
her
law
of
service
and
love
they
must
love
each
other
whatever
happened
there
was
no
quarrelling
at
meals
at
kate
house
rose
must
of
course
oblige
her
brother
sew
on
the
button
or
take
his
book
to
the
library
wolf
must
always
protect
the
girls
and
consider
them
wolf
firmly
believed
his
sister
and
cousin
to
be
the
sweetest
girls
in
the
world
rose
and
norma
regarded
wolf
as
perfection
in
human
form
they
rarely
met
without
embraces
never
without
brightening
eyes
and
light
hearts
that
this
attitude
toward
each
other
was
only
the
result
of
the
healthy
bodies
and
honest
souls
that
kate
had
given
them
they
would
hardly
have
believed
that
her
resolute
training
had
literally
forced
them
to
love
and
depend
upon
themselves
in
a
world
where
brothers
and
sisters
as
habitually
teased
and
annoyed
each
other
would
have
struck
them
as
fantastic
perhaps
kate
herself
hardly
knew
the
power
of
her
own
will
upon
them
her
commands
in
their
babyhood
had
not
been
couched
in
the
language
of
modern
nor
had
she
given
or
been
able
to
give
any
particular
reason
for
her
law
but
the
instinct
by
which
she
drew
wolf
attention
to
his
sister
goodness
or
noted
cleverness
for
rose
benefit
was
better
than
any
reason
she
summed
the
situation
up
simply
for
the
few
friends
she
had
with
the
phrase
they
all
crazy
about
each
other
every
one
of
them
kate
parlour
would
have
caused
annie
von
behrens
actual
faintness
but
it
was
a
delightful
place
to
rose
and
wolf
and
their
friends
the
cushioned
divan
on
sunday
nights
customarily
held
a
row
of
them
the
upright
ebony
piano
sifted
popular
music
impartially
upon
the
taboret
the
patent
rocker
and
the
rover
rug
they
laughed
gossiped
munched
candy
and
experimented
in
quite
as
happily
as
did
leslie
and
her
own
intimates
they
streamed
out
into
the
streets
and
sauntered
along
under
the
lights
to
the
moving
pictures
or
on
hot
summer
nights
they
perched
like
tiers
of
birds
on
the
steps
and
the
world
and
youth
seemed
sweet
to
them
in
kate
finished
in
black
wood
and
red
paper
they
made
welsh
rarebits
and
fudge
and
in
kate
spotless
kitchen
odours
of
toast
and
coffee
rose
at
unseemly
hours
lately
rose
and
norma
had
been
talking
of
changes
rose
was
employed
in
an
office
whose
severe
and
beautiful
interior
decoration
had
cost
thousands
of
dollars
and
norma
old
book
room
was
a
study
in
dull
carved
woods
oriental
rugs
dull
bronzes
and
flawless
glass
the
girls
began
to
feel
that
a
plain
cartridge
paper
and
net
curtains
might
well
replace
the
parlour
florid
green
scrolling
and
nottingham
lace
but
they
did
not
worry
about
it
it
served
as
a
topic
to
amuse
their
leisure
hours
the
subject
was
generally
routed
by
a
shrewd
allusion
from
norma
or
wolf
to
the
sort
of
parlour
people
would
like
if
they
got
married
married
to
someone
who
was
doing
very
well
in
the
shoe
business
for
example
these
allusions
deepened
the
colour
in
rose
happy
face
she
had
been
going
for
some
three
months
with
an
attractive
young
man
who
exactly
met
these
specifications
not
her
first
admirer
not
noticeable
for
any
especial
quality
yet
rose
and
norma
and
kate
too
felt
in
their
souls
that
rose
hour
had
come
young
harry
redding
was
a
big
broad
rather
inarticulate
fellow
whose
humble
calling
was
not
the
more
attractive
to
the
average
young
woman
because
he
supported
his
mother
by
it
but
he
suited
rose
more
he
seemed
wonderful
to
rose
and
because
her
dreams
had
always
been
humble
and
harry
was
a
thousand
times
more
than
she
had
dreamed
she
felt
herself
the
luckiest
girl
in
the
world
kate
sat
at
the
head
of
her
table
and
wolf
at
the
foot
rose
a
gentle
quiet
copy
of
her
handsome
mother
was
nearest
the
kitchen
door
to
which
she
made
constant
flying
trips
norma
was
opposite
rose
and
by
falling
back
heavily
could
tip
her
entire
chair
against
the
sideboard
from
which
she
extracted
forks
or
salt
or
candy
as
the
case
might
be
the
telephone
was
in
the
wolf
especial
responsibility
and
sheridan
herself
occasionally
left
the
table
for
calls
to
the
front
door
or
the
after
supper
the
girls
flew
through
their
share
of
it
never
weighed
very
heavily
upon
them
they
usually
began
the
process
of
piling
and
scraping
dishes
before
they
left
the
table
rose
whisking
the
tablecloth
into
its
drawer
as
norma
bumped
through
the
swinging
door
with
the
last
dishes
and
kate
halfway
through
the
washing
even
then
chattering
and
busy
they
hustled
the
hot
plates
onto
their
shelves
rattled
the
hot
plated
ware
into
its
basket
clanked
saucepans
and
splashed
water
not
fifteen
minutes
after
the
serving
of
the
dessert
the
last
signs
of
the
meal
had
been
obliterated
and
kate
was
guilty
of
what
the
girls
called
making
excuses
to
linger
in
the
kitchen
she
was
mixing
cereal
storing
cold
potatoes
and
cut
bread
soaking
but
these
things
did
not
belong
to
the
duties
of
norma
and
rose
and
the
younger
girl
could
flash
with
a
free
conscience
to
the
little
room
she
shared
with
rose
wolf
had
called
out
for
a
companion
they
were
going
to
take
a
walk
and
see
what
the
blizzard
had
done
norma
washed
her
face
the
velvety
skin
emerging
with
its
bloom
untouched
the
lips
crimson
the
blue
eyes
blazing
she
pressed
a
great
wave
of
silky
dark
hair
across
her
white
forehead
and
put
the
hat
at
a
dashing
angle
the
lace
blouse
the
pearl
beads
her
coat
again
and
norma
was
ready
to
dance
out
beside
wolf
as
if
fatigue
and
labours
did
not
exist
where
rose
he
said
as
they
went
downstairs
oh
wolf
saturday
night
harry
coming
of
course
norma
slipped
her
little
hand
in
its
shabby
glove
through
his
big
arm
she
and
aunt
kate
were
gossiping
suits
me
wolf
said
contentedly
he
held
her
firmly
on
the
slippery
lumps
of
packed
snow
the
sidewalks
were
almost
impassable
yet
hundreds
of
other
happy
persons
were
stumbling
and
scrambling
over
them
in
the
mild
winter
darkness
stars
were
out
and
whether
norma
was
blinking
up
at
them
or
staring
into
lighted
windows
of
candy
stores
and
fruit
markets
her
own
eyes
danced
and
twinkled
the
elevated
trains
thundered
above
their
heads
and
the
subway
roared
under
their
feet
great
advertising
signs
with
thousands
of
coloured
lights
fanned
up
and
down
in
a
haze
of
pink
and
blue
the
air
was
full
of
voices
laughing
and
shouting
and
the
screaming
of
coasting
children
i
have
my
pearls
on
norma
told
her
companion
they
stopped
for
some
molasses
peppermints
and
their
pungent
odour
mingled
for
norma
in
the
impression
of
this
happy
hour
wolf
how
do
they
do
that
the
girl
asked
watching
an
electric
sign
on
which
a
maid
mopped
a
dirty
floor
with
some
prepared
cleaner
leaving
the
floor
clean
after
her
mop
wolf
interested
explained
and
norma
listened
they
stopped
at
a
drug
store
and
studied
a
picture
that
subtly
altered
from
roosevelt
face
to
lincoln
and
thence
to
wilson
face
and
wolf
explained
that
too
norma
knew
that
he
understood
everything
of
that
nature
but
she
liked
to
impress
him
too
and
did
so
far
more
often
than
she
realized
with
her
when
norma
spoke
lightly
of
a
full
calf
edition
de
luxe
of
the
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
she
might
almost
have
been
speaking
in
that
language
for
all
she
conveyed
to
wolf
but
he
watched
the
animated
face
proudly
just
the
same
rose
had
always
been
good
and
steady
and
thoughtful
but
wolf
knew
that
norma
was
clever
taking
his
patronage
with
admiring
awe
but
daring
where
he
hesitated
and
boldly
at
home
where
he
was
ill
at
ease
when
she
said
that
when
she
got
married
she
wanted
dedham
china
and
just
a
plain
glass
bowl
for
goldfish
wolf
nodded
but
he
would
have
nodded
just
as
placidly
if
she
had
wanted
a
turkish
corner
and
bead
portières
and
when
she
asserted
that
she
would
be
leslie
melrose
for
anything
in
the
world
wolf
asked
in
simple
wonderment
why
she
should
be
imagine
a
maid
came
to
take
those
big
girls
home
wolf
they
can
speak
french
norma
confided
wolf
did
not
look
for
coherence
from
her
and
took
the
two
statements
on
their
face
value
now
i
know
i
not
pretty
she
continued
following
as
was
usual
with
her
some
obscure
line
of
thought
but
i
prettier
than
doris
alexander
and
she
had
her
picture
in
the
paper
who
broke
it
to
you
that
you
not
pretty
wolf
asked
well
i
i
not
norma
jumped
along
at
his
side
for
a
few
minutes
eyeing
him
expectantly
but
wolf
mind
was
honestly
busy
with
this
assertion
and
he
did
not
speak
was
she
pretty
girls
had
funny
standards
you
know
she
resumed
you
hate
a
girl
like
leslie
melrose
wolf
would
i
oh
you
loathe
her
but
i
tell
you
who
you
like
norma
added
in
a
sudden
burst
you
love
mr
liggett
why
should
i
wolf
asked
in
some
surprise
oh
because
he
nice
he
very
and
he
has
such
a
pleasant
voice
as
if
he
knew
everything
but
was
a
bit
conceited
norma
said
and
he
picks
out
books
for
his
wife
and
when
i
try
to
tell
him
something
about
them
he
always
knows
lots
more
you
know
in
a
pleasant
careless
sort
of
way
not
a
bit
as
if
he
was
showing
off
and
i
tell
you
what
he
did
miss
drake
was
showing
him
a
pottery
bowl
one
day
and
she
dropped
it
and
she
told
me
he
sort
of
caught
at
it
with
his
hand
and
he
said
to
biretta
very
stupidly
broken
this
just
put
it
on
my
bill
will
you
of
course
norma
added
vivaciously
old
immediately
said
that
it
was
nothing
at
all
but
what
miss
drake
would
have
caught
if
broken
it
perhaps
wolf
did
but
he
was
thinking
at
the
moment
that
the
family
baby
was
very
cunning
with
her
bright
eyes
and
indignant
mouth
he
stopped
her
before
a
vaudeville
house
in
a
flare
of
bright
light
want
to
go
in
oh
wolf
would
aunt
kate
care
oh
wolf
there
was
absolute
ecstasy
in
her
eyes
as
they
went
through
the
enchanted
doorway
and
up
the
rising
empty
foyer
toward
the
house
it
was
nine
the
performance
was
fairly
under
way
norma
rustled
into
a
seat
beside
her
companion
without
moving
her
eyes
from
the
coloured
comedian
on
the
stage
she
could
remove
hat
and
gloves
and
jacket
without
losing
an
instant
of
him
when
the
lights
went
up
wolf
approved
the
dark
hair
and
the
pearls
and
bent
toward
her
to
hear
the
unending
confidences
norma
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
better
and
even
wolf
admitted
that
it
was
a
good
show
they
finished
the
peppermints
and
were
very
happy
they
had
seen
the
big
film
and
so
could
cut
the
last
third
of
the
programme
and
reach
home
at
ten
there
was
no
comment
from
aunt
kate
who
was
yawning
over
the
evening
paper
in
the
rose
and
harry
were
murmuring
in
the
dimly
lighted
parlour
wolf
who
was
of
the
intense
type
that
discovers
a
new
world
every
time
it
reads
a
new
book
was
halfway
through
a
shabby
library
copy
of
war
and
peace
and
went
off
to
his
room
with
the
second
volume
under
his
arm
norma
went
to
her
room
too
but
she
sat
dreaming
before
the
mirror
thinking
of
that
melrose
house
and
of
leslie
friendliness
until
rose
came
in
at
eleven
chapter
iii
at
almost
this
same
moment
norma
self
was
the
subject
of
a
rather
unusual
talk
between
christopher
liggett
and
his
wife
christopher
had
come
softly
into
his
house
at
about
ten
to
find
alice
awake
still
on
the
big
couch
before
her
fire
her
little
bedroom
beyond
was
softly
lighted
the
white
bed
turned
down
and
the
religious
books
she
always
read
before
going
to
sleep
laid
in
place
by
miss
slater
but
alice
had
no
light
except
her
fire
and
two
or
three
candles
in
old
sconces
she
welcomed
christopher
with
a
smile
and
he
sat
down
in
his
somewhat
rumpled
evening
dress
and
smiled
back
at
her
in
a
rather
weary
fashion
he
often
told
her
that
these
rooms
of
hers
were
a
sanctuary
that
he
tested
the
men
and
women
he
met
daily
in
the
world
by
her
fine
and
lofty
standard
it
was
part
of
his
utter
generosity
to
her
that
he
talked
to
her
as
frankly
as
if
he
thought
aloud
and
it
was
alice
pride
and
joy
to
know
that
this
marriage
of
theirs
which
had
so
sadly
and
suddenly
become
no
marriage
at
all
was
not
as
as
the
world
might
have
suspected
her
clear
dispassionate
viewpoint
and
her
dignified
companionship
were
not
wifehood
but
they
were
dear
and
valuable
to
him
none
the
less
a
part
of
his
life
that
he
would
not
have
spared
and
he
could
still
admire
her
too
not
only
for
the
exquisite
clearness
of
her
intellect
her
french
and
italian
her
knowledge
of
countries
and
affairs
but
physically
the
clear
childish
forehead
that
was
as
unwrinkled
as
leslie
the
fair
beautifully
brushed
hair
the
mouth
with
its
chiselling
of
wisdom
and
of
pain
and
the
transparent
hand
from
which
she
shook
back
transparent
laces
she
was
always
proud
always
fresh
and
fragrant
always
free
for
him
and
for
his
problems
and
it
was
proverbial
in
the
circle
of
their
intimates
that
chris
admired
alice
with
all
his
heart
and
never
felt
himself
anything
but
the
privileged
guardian
of
a
treasure
he
dropped
into
a
chair
before
her
fire
and
she
watched
him
for
five
or
six
restful
minutes
in
silence
stupid
dinner
she
ventured
rotten
he
answered
cheerfully
i
was
late
but
i
got
in
to
hear
hendrick
speech
the
was
there
everyone
else
i
knew
i
cut
away
finally
i
done
up
i
thought
you
picked
up
hendrick
on
your
way
and
went
together
liggett
said
sympathetically
i
sorry
it
was
dull
i
suppose
men
have
to
go
to
these
political
things
chris
was
leaning
forward
his
locked
hands
dropped
between
his
knees
and
his
eyes
on
the
fire
hendrick
and
i
stopped
at
your
mother
he
said
deliberately
and
she
was
so
upset
that
i
sent
hendrick
on
alone
alice
eyes
lighted
apprehensively
but
she
spoke
very
quietly
what
was
it
chris
leslie
getting
saucy
oh
no
no
it
was
a
complication
of
things
i
imagine
christopher
took
out
his
looked
at
its
moiré
surface
reflectively
and
selected
a
smoke
she
was
tired
she
been
out
in
the
snow
leslie
had
gone
off
with
annie
to
some
débutante
affair
i
daresay
she
felt
blue
alice
do
you
remember
a
woman
named
kate
sheridan
the
question
was
sudden
and
alice
blinked
yes
i
do
she
answered
after
a
moment
thought
she
was
a
sort
of
maid
or
travelling
companion
of
mama
we
called
her
sheridan
she
was
quite
a
superior
sort
of
person
what
do
you
remember
about
her
dear
well
just
that
she
came
when
i
was
only
a
child
and
then
when
annie
was
ill
in
paris
she
went
abroad
with
mama
and
i
remember
that
she
came
back
and
she
used
to
come
see
me
at
school
for
mama
and
once
she
took
me
up
to
grandma
in
brookline
she
was
a
widow
and
she
had
a
child
or
two
maybe
why
chris
her
husband
did
not
answer
and
she
repeated
the
question
well
he
said
at
last
flinging
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
she
came
to
see
your
mother
alice
waited
a
little
at
a
loss
to
her
this
had
no
particular
significance
she
had
her
niece
with
her
young
girl
about
eighteen
christopher
said
well
what
it
alice
demanded
with
a
sort
of
superb
indifference
to
anything
such
a
woman
might
do
he
looked
at
her
through
his
round
eyeglasses
with
the
slight
frown
that
many
of
life
problems
brought
to
his
handsome
face
then
the
glass
fell
on
its
black
ribbon
and
he
laughed
that
just
what
i
do
he
said
but
tell
you
exactly
what
occurred
your
butler
joseph
joseph
joseph
told
me
that
at
about
four
this
sheridan
came
in
your
mother
had
told
him
that
she
was
expecting
the
lady
and
that
he
was
to
bring
her
upstairs
with
her
came
this
girl
i
remember
her
name
but
it
was
something
sheridan
nora
sheridan
maybe
leslie
carried
the
girl
off
for
tea
and
the
woman
stayed
with
your
mother
well
at
five
or
later
this
sheridan
ran
into
the
hall
and
it
seems
she
all
right
now
it
seems
that
your
mother
had
fainted
mama
alice
said
anxiously
with
an
incredulous
frown
yes
but
do
worry
she
absolutely
all
right
now
leslie
christopher
went
back
to
his
narrative
leslie
cried
and
i
suppose
there
was
a
scene
sheridan
and
the
girl
went
home
leslie
dressed
and
went
out
and
your
mother
immediately
telephoned
lee
judge
lee
yes
she
said
so
lee
up
in
westchester
with
his
daughter
she
could
get
him
but
chris
why
did
she
want
her
lawyer
that
just
it
well
then
she
telephoned
here
for
me
i
was
on
my
way
there
as
it
happened
and
just
before
eight
hendrick
and
i
went
in
i
could
see
she
was
altogether
up
stage
so
i
sent
von
on
and
had
it
out
with
her
and
what
was
her
explanation
chris
christopher
laughed
again
i
be
darned
he
said
thoughtfully
if
i
can
make
head
or
tail
of
it
it
would
be
funny
if
it
was
that
she
taking
it
so
hard
she
was
in
bed
and
she
had
been
crying
would
eat
any
dinner
but
chris
alice
said
worriedly
what
do
you
of
it
what
did
she
well
she
clasped
my
hand
and
she
said
that
she
had
an
opportunity
to
undo
a
great
wrong
and
that
i
must
help
her
and
not
ask
any
questions
she
was
just
acting
as
you
and
i
would
have
her
act
under
the
circumstances
what
circumstances
alice
said
at
an
utter
loss
as
he
paused
she
did
say
he
smiled
oh
come
now
chris
she
must
have
said
more
than
that
no
she
did
she
said
that
she
must
make
it
up
to
this
girl
and
she
wished
to
see
lee
about
it
immediately
to
change
her
will
alice
exclaimed
she
did
say
so
of
course
it
may
be
some
sort
of
blackmail
christopher
looked
whimsically
at
his
wife
as
i
remember
my
he
said
it
seems
to
me
improbable
that
out
of
the
past
could
come
this
engaging
young
girl
very
pretty
they
said
father
oh
nonsense
alice
exclaimed
almost
in
relief
at
the
absurdity
no
but
it
might
be
some
business
some
claim
against
the
firm
she
suggested
well
i
thought
of
that
but
there
are
one
or
two
reasons
why
it
does
seem
the
solution
i
asked
your
mother
if
it
was
money
and
she
said
no
said
it
positively
and
repeatedly
then
i
asked
her
if
she
would
like
this
sheridan
woman
shut
up
and
she
was
quite
indignant
kate
kate
was
one
of
the
most
magnificent
women
god
had
ever
made
and
so
on
well
i
do
remember
sheridan
as
a
lovely
sort
of
person
alice
contributed
plain
you
know
but
quite
wonderful
for
well
it
funny
but
then
you
know
mama
is
terribly
excitable
she
added
she
gets
frightfully
worked
up
over
nothing
or
almost
nothing
it
quite
possible
that
when
kate
recalled
old
times
to
her
she
suddenly
wished
that
she
had
done
more
for
kate
something
like
that
she
think
nothing
of
sending
for
judge
lee
on
the
spot
you
remember
her
recalling
us
from
our
because
she
find
the
pearls
all
the
way
from
lake
louise
to
hear
that
they
had
been
lost
i
know
christopher
smiled
she
is
unique
belle
by
george
i
never
forget
our
rushing
into
the
house
like
maniacs
not
knowing
what
had
happened
to
leslie
or
acton
and
having
her
fall
sobbing
into
your
arms
with
the
pearls
in
her
hands
mama
wonderful
alice
laughed
chris
did
you
eat
any
dinner
he
considered
but
i
really
not
hungry
dear
he
protested
alice
superbly
incredulous
rang
at
once
who
was
in
the
kitchen
well
she
was
to
be
asked
to
send
up
a
tray
at
once
to
liggett
now
that
you
asked
me
the
dinner
had
reached
the
point
of
in
a
paper
tub
as
i
sat
down
he
remembered
you
a
little
miracle
of
healing
to
me
alice
when
i
came
in
here
i
did
know
we
were
up
against
as
a
family
your
mother
wished
the
girl
pensioned
oh
chris
not
really
i
give
you
my
word
but
he
was
enough
his
usual
self
to
have
taken
his
seat
at
the
piano
now
and
was
looking
at
her
across
it
while
his
fingers
fitted
themselves
lazily
to
chords
and
harmonics
i
tell
you
something
if
you
promise
to
stop
playing
the
instant
your
supper
comes
up
i
promise
well
then
the
new
puccini
is
there
she
nodded
toward
the
and
he
turned
to
the
new
score
with
an
eager
exclamation
fifteen
minutes
later
she
had
to
scold
him
to
bring
him
to
the
fire
again
and
to
the
smoking
little
supper
while
alice
sipped
ginger
ale
christopher
fell
upon
his
meal
and
they
discussed
the
probable
presentation
of
the
opera
and
its
quality
but
an
hour
later
when
she
was
in
bed
and
christopher
was
going
back
to
the
piano
for
another
of
music
she
caught
his
hand
chris
you
not
worried
about
this
sheridan
matter
worried
no
dearest
child
what
is
there
to
worry
about
it
blackmail
apparently
it
nothing
but
an
overdose
of
imagination
on
your
mother
part
if
the
girl
really
was
promised
something
or
has
for
example
old
stock
or
if
her
father
was
an
employee
who
did
this
or
that
or
the
other
sheridan
husband
was
employed
by
your
father
at
the
time
of
his
death
by
the
way
why
it
easy
enough
to
pay
the
claim
whatever
it
is
the
girl
seems
to
have
made
a
nice
impression
your
mother
tells
me
she
sold
me
books
but
that
mean
much
i
buy
books
everywhere
no
i
do
think
you
ever
hear
of
her
again
but
your
mother
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
see
what
you
can
make
of
it
all
oh
of
course
it
nothing
alice
said
confidently
and
christopher
returned
to
his
beloved
piano
relieved
in
mind
by
his
wife
counsel
refreshed
in
body
by
the
impromptu
supper
and
ready
for
the
music
that
soothed
in
him
all
the
restless
and
unsatisfied
fibres
of
his
soul
chapter
iv
annie
who
signed
herself
anne
melrose
von
behrens
was
the
real
dictator
in
the
various
circles
of
the
allied
families
and
had
a
fashion
of
finding
herself
supreme
in
larger
circles
as
well
annie
was
or
eight
tall
thin
superb
in
manner
and
bearing
nature
had
been
generous
to
her
but
she
had
done
far
more
for
herself
than
nature
had
her
matchless
skin
her
figure
her
hands
her
voice
were
all
the
result
of
painstaking
and
intelligent
care
annie
had
been
a
headstrong
undisciplined
girl
twenty
years
ago
she
had
come
back
from
a
european
visit
at
with
a
vague
if
general
reputation
of
being
a
terror
but
annie
was
clever
and
she
had
real
charm
she
spoke
familiarly
of
european
courts
had
been
presented
even
in
inaccessible
vienna
she
spoke
languages
quoted
poets
had
great
writers
and
painters
for
her
friends
and
rippled
through
songs
that
had
been
indisputably
dedicated
in
flowing
foreign
hands
to
the
beautiful
mademoiselle
melrose
society
bowed
before
annie
she
was
the
sensation
of
her
winter
and
the
marriage
she
promptly
made
was
the
most
brilliant
in
many
winters
annie
proceeded
to
bear
her
sober
fine
dull
and
devoted
hendrick
two
splendid
sons
and
thus
riveted
to
herself
his
lasting
devotion
and
trust
the
old
name
was
safe
the
millions
would
descend
duly
to
young
hendrick
and
piet
the
family
had
been
rich
conspicuous
and
respected
in
the
city
since
its
sturdy
holstein
cattle
had
browsed
along
the
fields
of
lower
broadway
but
under
annie
hands
it
began
to
shine
annie
handsome
bore
the
family
arms
her
china
had
been
made
in
the
ancestral
village
two
miles
from
rotterdam
and
also
carried
the
shield
her
city
home
in
fifth
avenue
was
so
magnificent
so
chastely
restrained
and
sober
so
sternly
dignified
that
it
set
the
cue
for
half
the
other
homes
of
the
set
servants
had
been
in
the
von
behrens
family
for
years
there
was
nothing
in
the
avenue
house
or
the
newport
summer
home
that
was
not
as
handsome
as
old
as
solid
as
carven
as
richly
dull
or
as
purely
shining
as
human
ingenuity
could
contrive
to
have
it
collectors
saved
their
choicest
discoveries
for
annie
and
there
was
no
painter
in
the
new
world
who
would
not
have
been
proud
to
have
annie
place
a
canvas
of
his
among
her
treasures
from
the
old
if
family
relics
were
worth
preserving
what
could
be
more
remarkable
than
annie
washington
letter
her
jefferson
tray
her
gainsboroughs
of
the
murisons
who
had
been
the
only
americans
so
honoured
by
the
painter
melrose
and
von
behrens
honours
crowded
each
other
here
was
the
thin
old
silver
shepherdess
cup
awarded
that
johanna
von
behrens
who
had
won
a
prize
with
her
sheep
while
washington
was
yet
a
boy
and
here
the
quaint
that
a
great
prince
homeless
and
unknown
had
given
the
american
family
that
took
him
in
and
the
silver
buttons
from
lafayette
waistcoat
that
the
great
frenchman
had
presented
colonel
horace
murison
of
the
continentals
these
things
were
not
thrust
at
the
visitor
nor
indeed
were
they
conspicuous
among
the
thousand
other
priceless
souvenirs
that
annie
had
gathered
about
her
rather
nice
is
it
annie
would
say
abstractedly
when
some
enthusiastic
girl
pored
over
the
colonial
letters
or
the
old
portraits
see
here
margaret
she
might
add
casually
do
you
see
the
inside
of
this
little
slipper
my
dear
read
what
written
there
these
slippers
deborah
murison
danced
with
governor
winthrop
on
the
night
of
her
fifteenth
birthday
july
is
that
rather
quaint
annie
could
afford
to
be
casual
to
be
abstracted
in
her
all
the
pride
of
the
melrose
and
murison
families
was
gathered
hers
was
an
arrogance
so
sure
of
itself
a
so
supreme
that
the
world
questioned
it
no
more
than
it
questioned
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
old
silver
the
copleys
and
the
colonial
china
the
knickerbocker
court
chests
with
their
great
locks
of
dutch
silver
and
the
laces
that
had
been
shown
at
the
hague
two
hundred
years
before
were
all
confirmed
all
reinforced
as
it
were
by
the
power
and
prosperity
of
it
was
no
glory
that
made
brilliant
the
lives
of
hendrick
and
anne
melrose
von
behrens
hendrick
cousins
and
uncles
magnificent
persons
of
title
were
prominent
in
holland
their
names
associated
with
that
of
royalty
and
their
gracious
friendship
extended
to
the
american
branch
of
the
family
whenever
hendrick
chose
to
claim
it
old
maps
of
new
york
bore
the
boundary
lines
of
the
von
behrens
farm
early
histories
of
the
city
mingled
the
names
of
melrose
and
von
behrens
among
those
of
the
men
who
had
served
the
public
need
wherever
there
was
needed
that
tone
that
only
names
of
prominence
and
wealth
can
bestow
annie
name
was
solicited
wherever
it
appeared
it
gave
the
instant
stamp
of
dignity
and
integrity
she
had
seen
this
goal
dimly
in
the
distance
when
she
stepped
from
her
rather
spoiled
and
wilful
girlhood
into
this
splendid
wifehood
but
even
annie
was
astonished
at
the
rapidity
with
which
it
had
come
about
mama
of
course
had
known
all
the
right
people
even
if
she
dropped
all
social
ties
after
papa
death
and
hendrick
name
was
an
open
sesame
but
even
so
it
was
surprising
and
it
was
gratifying
in
appearance
annie
had
no
problem
if
she
was
not
a
beauty
she
was
near
enough
to
being
one
she
was
smart
enough
and
blonde
enough
and
splendidly
dressed
enough
to
be
instantly
identifiable
and
that
was
all
she
desired
financially
annie
had
no
problem
her
own
inheritance
and
her
husband
great
wealth
silenced
all
question
there
the
murison
pearls
and
the
famous
diamond
tiara
that
her
father
had
given
her
mother
years
ago
had
come
to
annie
but
they
were
eclipsed
by
the
von
behrens
family
jewels
and
these
were
all
hers
with
the
laces
and
the
ivories
and
the
brocades
life
could
give
nothing
more
to
annie
but
not
many
women
would
have
made
so
much
of
what
annie
had
there
was
far
down
and
out
of
sight
a
little
streak
of
the
adventuress
in
her
and
she
never
stopped
halfway
a
young
wife
annie
had
dutifully
considered
her
nursery
hendrick
is
the
elder
line
of
course
although
it
is
the
colonial
one
annie
had
said
superintending
a
princely
layette
the
child
was
a
son
his
father
image
and
nobody
who
knew
annie
was
in
the
least
surprised
that
fortune
had
fallen
in
with
her
plans
it
was
the
magnificent
annie
who
was
quoted
as
telling
madame
modiste
to
give
her
a
fitter
who
would
not
talk
it
was
annie
who
decided
what
should
be
done
in
recognizing
the
principals
of
the
jacqmain
divorce
and
that
old
floyd
densmore
should
not
be
accepted
annie
neat
and
quiet
answer
to
a
certain
social
acquaintance
who
remarked
in
little
gallery
i
have
seen
the
original
of
that
picture
in
one
of
the
european
galleries
was
still
quoted
by
annie
friends
this
the
original
annie
had
said
quite
simply
and
truthfully
leslie
admired
her
aunt
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
grandma
was
and
aunt
alice
insignificant
in
leslie
eyes
but
stunning
arrogant
fearless
aunt
annie
was
the
model
upon
which
she
would
have
based
herself
if
she
had
known
how
annie
quick
positiveness
with
her
servants
her
cool
friendliness
with
big
men
and
clever
men
her
calm
assurance
as
to
which
hats
she
liked
and
which
hats
she
did
her
utter
belief
in
everything
that
was
of
melrose
or
von
behrens
and
her
calm
contempt
for
everything
that
was
not
were
masterly
in
leslie
eyes
annie
might
have
been
a
strong
royalist
had
she
been
born
a
few
generations
earlier
but
in
annie
day
the
ideal
of
social
service
had
been
laid
down
by
fashion
and
she
was
consequently
a
tremendously
independent
and
energetic
person
with
small
time
for
languishing
airs
she
headed
committees
and
boards
knew
hundreds
of
working
girls
by
name
kept
a
secretary
and
a
stenographer
and
mentioned
topics
at
big
dinners
that
would
not
have
shocked
either
old
goodwife
melrose
of
boston
or
vrouw
von
behrens
of
nieu
amsterdam
for
neither
had
the
faintest
idea
that
such
things
or
their
names
existed
withal
annie
was
attractive
even
her
little
affectations
were
impressive
and
as
she
went
about
from
luncheons
to
meetings
swept
up
to
her
model
nursery
to
revel
in
her
model
boys
tossed
aside
regal
furs
and
tore
off
princely
rings
the
better
to
play
with
them
wrapped
her
beautiful
figure
in
satins
and
jewels
to
descend
to
formal
dinners
she
was
almost
as
much
admired
and
envied
and
copied
as
she
might
fondly
have
hoped
to
be
she
managed
her
life
on
modern
lines
of
efficiency
planned
ahead
what
she
wished
tutored
herself
not
to
think
of
anything
undesirable
as
being
even
in
the
range
of
possibility
trod
lightly
upon
the
sensitive
souls
of
others
and
asked
no
quarter
herself
aimed
high
and
enjoyed
her
life
and
its
countless
successes
to
the
full
of
course
there
had
been
setbacks
her
brother
theodore
his
most
unfortunate
marriage
to
a
servant
his
intemperance
the
general
scandal
of
his
mother
violent
detestation
of
his
wife
all
this
was
most
unpleasant
but
louison
the
wife
upon
sufficient
pressure
had
brought
her
child
to
the
melroses
and
had
doubtfully
disappeared
and
theodore
had
returned
from
his
wanderings
to
live
silent
and
unobtrusive
in
his
mother
home
for
several
years
and
to
die
with
his
daughter
beside
him
and
be
duly
laid
in
the
melrose
plot
at
woodlawn
and
leslie
leslie
had
repaid
them
all
for
all
of
it
alice
was
another
disappointment
or
had
been
one
to
annie
for
alice
after
having
achieved
a
most
unexpectedly
satisfactory
marriage
and
having
set
up
her
household
gods
in
the
very
shadow
of
her
brilliant
example
as
it
were
had
met
with
that
most
unfortunate
accident
for
a
few
years
annie
had
been
utterly
exasperated
whenever
she
thought
of
it
for
christopher
was
really
an
extraordinary
husband
for
alice
to
hold
even
in
normal
circumstances
he
was
so
outrageously
frightfully
irresistibly
popular
with
women
everywhere
his
wife
must
needs
keep
a
very
sharp
albeit
loving
eye
upon
him
a
sickly
wife
a
wife
who
was
a
burden
and
a
reproach
that
would
be
fatal
to
them
all
but
alice
had
showed
unsuspected
courage
and
pride
in
this
hard
trial
she
had
made
herself
beautiful
tactful
she
had
made
herself
a
magnet
to
her
husband
friends
and
his
home
the
centre
of
a
real
social
group
annie
respected
her
for
it
and
helped
her
by
flashing
into
her
rooms
not
less
often
than
every
alternate
day
with
gossip
with
books
with
hints
that
showed
alice
just
where
her
course
in
this
or
that
matter
must
lie
so
alice
had
come
to
be
an
actual
asset
and
now
to
her
aunt
tremendous
satisfaction
leslie
promised
to
add
one
more
feather
to
the
family
cap
by
announcing
her
engagement
to
acton
liggett
annie
smiled
to
herself
whenever
she
thought
of
it
when
this
was
consummated
she
would
have
nothing
left
but
the
selection
of
suitable
wives
for
hendrick
junior
now
aged
ten
and
piet
who
was
four
years
younger
two
or
three
days
after
the
ending
of
the
big
and
the
beginning
of
that
domestic
storm
that
was
destined
strangely
to
change
some
of
the
lives
nearest
her
annie
went
in
to
have
luncheon
with
her
sister
it
was
a
brilliant
sunshiny
winter
day
with
crossings
swimming
in
melting
snow
and
roofs
steaming
brightly
into
the
clear
air
annie
went
straight
upstairs
to
alice
room
with
the
usual
apology
for
lateness
she
kissed
alice
lightly
on
the
forehead
and
while
freda
was
coming
and
going
with
their
meal
they
discussed
the
little
boys
books
politics
and
the
difficulties
of
the
city
in
the
snow
but
when
they
were
alone
annie
asked
immediately
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
mama
alice
you
mean
about
did
she
tell
you
no
she
did
have
to
leslie
ran
in
yesterday
afternoon
and
told
me
that
mama
has
been
in
bed
since
saturday
i
telephoned
sunday
morning
but
hendrick
and
i
were
taking
the
boys
up
to
his
uncle
house
in
westchester
and
as
she
did
say
one
word
about
being
ill
i
see
her
that
day
nor
yesterday
as
it
happened
for
we
did
come
down
until
noon
when
leslie
came
in
there
were
other
people
there
for
tea
and
i
did
have
a
chance
to
speak
to
her
alone
but
i
went
over
to
mama
this
morning
and
she
seems
all
broken
up
what
did
she
tell
you
alice
asked
anxiously
oh
my
dear
you
know
mama
she
wept
and
patted
my
hand
and
said
that
it
was
sad
to
be
the
last
of
your
own
generation
and
she
hoped
you
and
i
would
always
have
each
other
and
that
she
had
always
loved
us
and
tried
to
do
her
best
for
us
alice
laughed
poor
mama
she
gets
so
worked
up
she
said
but
what
do
you
make
of
it
demanded
annie
she
talked
of
this
kate
sheridan
i
remember
her
perfectly
she
came
to
paris
when
i
was
so
ill
years
ago
poor
mama
cried
and
said
that
she
wished
to
do
something
for
kate
now
you
know
alice
annie
went
on
reasonably
nobody
is
tying
mama
hands
if
she
wants
to
educate
this
young
girl
this
norma
person
to
please
kate
or
all
her
children
for
that
matter
she
does
have
to
go
into
hysterics
and
send
for
judge
lee
she
said
she
did
feel
at
all
well
and
she
wanted
to
secure
to
kate
some
money
in
her
will
i
told
her
it
was
ridiculous
she
never
looked
better
in
her
life
i
wish
she
could
get
over
to
see
you
alice
you
always
soothe
her
so
what
on
earth
does
chris
make
of
it
well
i
tell
you
what
we
done
alice
smiled
chris
went
to
see
her
sunday
and
they
had
a
long
talk
he
tells
me
that
she
was
just
as
vague
and
unsatisfactory
as
ever
but
calmer
and
she
finally
admitted
that
all
she
really
wanted
to
do
was
to
befriend
this
niece
of
kate
sheridan
of
course
chris
and
i
think
mama
has
one
of
her
funny
notions
about
it
but
if
the
child
mother
had
befriended
mama
for
example
a
thousand
years
ago
or
if
mama
had
borrowed
five
dollars
from
kate
and
forgotten
to
return
it
you
know
that
would
be
enough
to
account
for
all
this
excitement
yes
i
know
annie
admitted
with
her
favourite
look
of
intolerant
yet
indulgent
scorn
well
it
seems
the
girl
is
in
biretta
bookshop
and
chris
has
often
bought
books
of
her
so
to
quiet
mama
he
promised
that
he
would
bring
her
out
here
to
have
tea
with
me
some
day
soon
mama
was
delighted
and
i
think
she
hopes
that
a
friendship
will
come
of
it
alice
threw
herself
back
into
the
pillows
and
drew
a
great
breath
as
if
she
were
weary
i
only
want
to
please
mama
she
finished
you
an
angel
annie
said
absently
i
suppose
i
could
get
the
truth
out
of
mama
in
five
seconds
she
mused
it
looks
to
me
rather
like
blackmail
no
she
said
not
alice
contradicted
quickly
well
it
all
so
silly
the
elder
sister
said
impatiently
and
coming
just
now
she
added
significantly
yes
i
know
alice
agreed
with
a
comprehending
look
and
in
lowered
tones
they
began
to
talk
of
leslie
possible
engagement
chapter
v
norma
sheridan
saw
the
engagement
announced
in
a
morning
paper
two
weeks
later
and
carried
the
picture
of
pretty
miss
melrose
home
to
entertain
the
dinner
table
the
news
had
been
made
known
at
a
dinner
given
to
forty
young
persons
in
the
home
of
the
débutante
aunt
hendrick
von
behrens
miss
melrose
said
the
paper
was
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
the
late
theodore
melrose
and
made
her
home
with
her
grandmother
liggett
was
the
brother
of
christopher
liggett
whose
marriage
to
miss
alice
melrose
was
a
social
event
some
years
ago
a
number
of
dinners
and
dances
were
already
planned
in
honour
of
the
young
pair
norma
looked
at
the
pictured
face
with
a
little
stir
of
feelings
so
confused
that
she
could
not
define
them
at
her
heart
but
she
passed
the
paper
to
her
aunt
with
no
comment
you
might
send
them
two
dozen
kitchen
towels
mother
wolf
suggested
drily
and
rose
laughed
joyously
her
own
engagement
present
from
her
mother
had
been
this
extremely
practical
one
and
rose
loved
to
open
her
lower
bureau
drawer
and
gloat
over
the
incredible
richness
of
possessing
smooth
all
her
own
norma
had
brought
her
two
thick
dull
gray
dedham
bowls
with
ducks
waddling
around
them
and
these
were
in
the
drawer
too
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
and
beside
these
were
the
length
of
silk
that
rose
had
had
for
a
year
without
making
up
and
six
of
her
mother
fine
sheets
of
irish
linen
and
two
glass
candlesticks
that
rose
had
won
at
a
party
altogether
rose
felt
that
she
was
making
great
strides
toward
especially
as
she
and
harry
must
wait
for
months
perhaps
a
year
norma
had
promised
her
two
towels
a
month
until
there
were
a
whole
dozen
and
wolf
prompted
by
the
same
generous
little
heart
told
her
not
to
give
the
a
thought
for
she
was
to
have
the
handsomest
one
that
money
could
buy
with
a
oven
and
a
from
her
brother
rose
walked
upon
air
but
norma
was
in
a
mood
that
she
herself
seemed
unable
to
understand
or
to
combat
she
felt
a
constant
inclination
toward
tears
she
did
hate
the
melroses
no
they
had
been
most
friendly
and
kind
but
but
it
was
a
funny
world
in
which
one
girl
had
everything
like
leslie
and
another
girl
had
no
brighter
prospect
than
to
drudge
away
in
a
bookstore
all
her
life
or
to
go
out
on
sundays
with
her
cousin
norma
dreamed
for
hours
of
leslie
life
the
ease
and
warmth
and
beauty
of
it
and
when
leslie
was
actually
heralded
as
engaged
the
younger
girl
felt
a
pang
of
the
first
actual
jealousy
she
had
ever
known
she
imagined
the
beautiful
in
which
acton
liggett
perhaps
as
fascinating
a
person
as
his
brother
would
clasp
pearls
about
leslie
fair
little
throat
she
imagined
the
shining
dinner
tables
at
which
leslie
modestly
dropped
blonde
head
would
be
stormed
with
compliments
and
congratulations
and
suddenly
molasses
peppermints
and
became
odious
to
her
and
she
almost
disliked
rose
for
her
pitiable
ecstasies
over
china
bowls
and
all
the
pleasant
excitement
of
her
call
upon
melrose
with
aunt
kate
died
away
it
had
seemed
the
beginning
of
some
vaguely
progress
toward
a
life
of
beauty
and
achievement
but
it
was
two
weeks
ago
now
and
its
glamour
was
fading
true
christopher
liggett
had
come
into
biretta
bookstore
with
leslie
and
he
and
norma
had
talked
together
for
a
few
minutes
and
leslie
had
extended
her
aunt
alice
kind
invitation
for
tea
but
no
day
had
been
set
for
the
tea
norma
reflected
gloomily
now
she
supposed
the
stir
of
leslie
engagement
would
put
all
that
out
of
head
wolf
was
not
particularly
sympathetic
with
her
she
mused
disconsolately
wolf
had
been
acting
in
an
unprecedented
manner
of
late
rose
engagement
seemed
to
have
completely
turned
his
head
he
laughed
at
norma
hardly
heard
her
words
when
she
spoke
to
him
and
never
moved
his
eyes
from
her
when
they
were
together
norma
could
not
look
up
from
her
book
or
her
plate
or
from
the
study
of
a
broadway
shop
window
without
encountering
that
same
steady
unembarrassed
stare
what
the
matter
with
you
wolf
she
would
ask
impatiently
but
wolf
never
told
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
know
he
was
a
silent
thoughtful
fellow
old
for
his
years
in
many
ways
and
in
some
still
a
boy
norma
and
rose
had
known
only
the
more
prosperous
years
of
kate
life
but
wolf
remembered
many
a
vigil
with
his
mother
remembered
her
lonely
struggles
to
make
a
living
for
him
and
for
the
girls
he
himself
was
the
type
that
inevitably
prospers
industrious
good
intelligent
and
painstaking
but
as
a
young
boy
in
the
working
world
he
had
early
seen
the
terrors
in
the
lives
of
men
about
him
drink
dirt
unemployment
and
disease
debt
and
dishonour
wolf
was
not
quick
of
thought
he
had
little
imagination
rather
marvelling
at
other
men
cleverness
than
displaying
any
of
his
own
and
he
had
reached
perhaps
his
or
summer
before
he
realized
that
these
terrors
did
not
menace
him
that
whatever
changes
he
made
in
his
work
would
be
improvements
steps
upward
for
actual
months
after
the
move
to
new
york
wolf
had
pondered
it
in
quiet
gratitude
and
pleasure
rent
and
bills
could
be
paid
there
might
be
theatre
treats
for
the
girls
and
chicken
for
sunday
supper
and
yet
the
savings
account
in
the
broadway
bank
might
grow
steadily
too
far
from
being
a
slave
to
his
employer
wolf
began
to
realize
that
this
rather
simple
person
was
afraid
of
him
afraid
that
young
sheridan
and
some
of
the
other
smart
ingenious
practically
educated
men
in
his
employ
might
recognize
too
soon
their
own
independence
and
when
the
second
summer
in
new
york
came
and
wolf
could
negotiate
the
modest
financial
deal
that
gave
him
and
the
girls
a
to
cruise
about
in
on
sundays
and
holidays
when
they
could
picnic
up
in
beautiful
connecticut
or
unpack
the
little
fringed
red
napkins
far
down
on
the
long
island
shore
life
had
begun
to
seem
very
pleasant
to
him
debt
and
dirt
and
all
the
squalid
horrors
of
what
he
had
seen
and
what
he
had
read
had
faded
from
his
mind
and
for
awhile
he
had
felt
that
his
cup
could
hold
no
more
but
now
just
lately
there
was
something
else
and
although
the
full
significance
of
it
had
not
yet
actually
dawned
upon
him
wolf
began
to
realize
that
a
change
was
near
it
was
the
most
miraculous
thing
that
had
ever
come
to
him
although
it
concerned
only
little
norma
only
the
little
cousin
who
had
been
an
actual
member
of
his
family
for
all
these
years
he
had
heard
his
mother
say
a
thousand
times
that
she
was
pretty
he
had
laughed
himself
a
thousand
times
at
her
quick
wit
but
he
had
never
dreamed
that
it
would
make
his
heart
come
up
into
his
throat
and
suffocate
him
whenever
he
thought
of
her
or
that
her
lightest
and
simplest
words
her
most
casual
and
unconscious
glance
would
burn
in
his
heart
for
hours
during
his
busy
days
wolf
found
himself
musing
about
this
undefined
and
nebulous
happiness
that
began
to
tremble
like
a
growing
brightness
behind
clouds
through
all
his
days
and
nights
had
there
ever
been
a
time
he
wondered
when
he
had
taken
her
for
granted
helped
her
into
her
blessed
little
coat
as
coolly
as
he
had
rose
had
it
been
this
same
norma
who
scolded
him
about
throwing
his
collars
on
the
floor
and
who
had
sent
his
coat
to
the
cleaner
with
a
bill
in
the
pocket
wolf
remembered
summer
days
and
little
norma
chattering
beside
him
on
the
front
seat
as
the
shabby
fled
through
the
hot
dry
city
toward
shade
and
coolness
he
remembered
early
christmas
mass
and
norma
and
rose
kneeling
between
him
and
his
mother
in
the
warm
church
he
remembered
breakfast
afterward
in
a
general
sense
of
hunger
and
relaxation
and
and
the
girls
exulting
over
their
presents
and
every
time
that
childish
figure
came
into
his
dream
that
mop
of
cloudy
dark
hair
and
flashing
laugh
the
new
delicious
sense
of
some
unknown
felicity
touched
him
and
he
would
glance
about
the
busy
factory
as
if
his
thoughts
were
written
on
his
face
for
all
the
world
to
read
wolf
had
never
had
a
sweetheart
it
came
to
him
with
the
blinding
flash
of
all
discoveries
that
norma
was
his
girl
that
he
wanted
norma
for
his
own
and
that
there
was
no
barrier
between
them
and
in
the
ecstasy
of
this
new
vision
which
changed
the
whole
face
of
his
world
he
was
content
to
wait
with
no
special
impatience
for
the
hour
in
which
he
should
claim
her
of
course
norma
must
like
him
must
love
him
as
he
did
her
unworthy
as
he
felt
himself
of
her
and
wonderful
as
this
new
norma
seemed
to
be
wolf
in
his
simple
way
felt
that
this
had
been
his
destiny
from
the
beginning
that
a
glimpse
of
life
as
foreign
and
unnatural
as
the
melrose
life
might
seriously
disenchant
norma
never
occurred
to
him
norma
had
always
been
fanciful
it
was
a
part
of
her
charm
wolf
who
worked
in
the
great
forman
shops
had
felt
it
no
particular
distinction
when
by
chance
one
day
he
had
been
called
from
his
luncheon
to
look
at
the
engine
of
young
stanley
forman
car
he
had
left
his
seat
upon
a
pile
of
lumber
bolted
the
last
of
his
pie
and
leaned
over
the
hood
of
the
specially
designed
racer
interested
only
in
its
peculiarities
and
entirely
indifferent
to
the
respectful
young
owner
who
was
aware
that
he
knew
far
less
about
it
than
this
mechanic
did
sauntering
back
to
his
work
in
the
autumn
sunlight
wolf
had
followed
the
youthful
millionaire
by
not
even
a
thought
if
he
had
done
so
it
might
have
been
a
decision
that
a
man
who
knew
so
little
of
engines
ought
not
to
drive
a
racer
so
norma
jealousies
desires
and
dreams
were
a
sealed
book
to
him
but
this
very
unreasonableness
lent
her
an
odd
exotic
charm
in
his
eyes
she
was
to
wolf
like
a
baby
who
wants
the
moon
the
moon
might
be
an
awkward
and
useless
possession
and
the
baby
much
better
without
it
still
there
is
something
winning
and
touching
about
the
little
imperious
mouth
and
the
little
upstretched
arms
one
night
when
he
had
reached
home
earlier
than
either
of
the
girls
wolf
was
in
the
warm
bright
kitchen
alone
with
his
mother
he
was
seated
at
the
end
of
the
scrubbed
and
bleached
little
table
kate
at
the
other
end
was
neatly
and
dexterously
packing
a
yellow
bowl
with
bread
pudding
do
you
remember
years
and
years
ago
mother
wolf
said
chewing
a
raisin
thoughtfully
that
you
told
me
that
norma
is
my
real
cousin
kate
ruddy
colour
paled
a
little
and
she
looked
anxious
not
perseus
coming
at
last
in
sight
of
his
gorgon
had
a
heart
more
sick
with
fear
than
hers
was
at
that
instant
what
put
that
into
your
head
dear
well
i
do
know
but
it
true
is
it
kate
scattered
chopped
nuts
from
the
bowl
of
her
spoon
yes
it
true
she
said
there
not
a
drop
of
the
same
blood
in
your
veins
although
i
love
her
as
i
do
you
and
rose
she
was
silent
and
wolf
idly
turning
the
in
an
empty
dish
smiled
to
himself
but
what
made
you
think
of
that
wolf
his
mother
asked
i
do
know
wolf
did
not
look
at
her
but
his
big
handsome
face
was
suffused
with
happy
colour
harry
and
rose
maybe
he
admitted
kate
sat
down
suddenly
her
eyes
upon
him
not
the
baby
she
half
whispered
her
son
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
folded
his
big
arms
across
his
chest
when
he
looked
at
her
the
smile
had
faded
from
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
a
trifle
narrowed
and
his
mouth
set
i
guess
so
he
said
simply
i
guess
it
always
been
norma
but
i
did
always
know
it
i
used
to
think
of
her
as
just
another
sister
like
rose
but
i
know
now
that
she
never
seem
that
again
never
did
really
he
was
silent
and
kate
sat
staring
at
him
in
silence
has
she
any
relatives
mother
has
what
has
she
people
who
are
they
kate
looked
at
the
floor
she
has
no
one
but
me
son
of
course
she
not
nineteen
and
i
do
believe
it
ever
crossed
her
mind
wolf
said
i
do
think
norma
ever
had
a
real
affair
just
kid
affairs
like
paul
harrison
and
that
man
at
the
store
who
used
to
send
her
flowers
but
i
do
believe
those
count
i
do
think
she
ever
has
kate
said
heavily
getting
to
her
feet
and
beginning
to
pour
her
custard
slowly
through
the
packed
bread
presently
she
stopped
and
set
the
saucepan
down
her
eyes
narrowed
and
fixed
on
space
then
wolf
saw
her
press
the
fingers
of
one
hand
upon
her
mouth
a
sure
sign
of
mental
perturbation
i
know
i
not
worthy
to
tie
her
little
shoes
for
her
mother
he
said
suddenly
and
very
low
there
no
woman
in
the
world
good
enough
for
you
his
mother
answered
with
a
troubled
laugh
and
she
gave
the
top
of
his
head
one
of
her
rare
brisk
kisses
as
she
passed
him
on
her
way
out
of
the
room
wolf
was
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
domestic
routine
to
know
that
every
minute
was
precious
now
and
that
she
was
setting
the
table
but
his
heart
was
heavy
with
a
vague
uneasiness
she
had
not
encouraged
him
very
much
she
had
not
accepted
this
suggestion
as
she
did
almost
all
of
the
young
people
ideas
with
eager
cooperation
and
sympathy
he
sat
brooding
at
the
kitchen
table
her
notable
lack
of
enthusiasm
chilling
him
and
infusing
him
with
her
own
doubts
when
she
came
back
she
stood
with
her
back
turned
to
him
busied
with
some
manipulation
of
platters
and
jars
in
the
wolf
dear
she
said
i
want
to
ask
you
something
the
child
too
young
to
listen
to
you
or
any
one
now
promise
me
that
you
speak
to
me
again
before
you
certainly
i
promise
that
mother
wolf
said
quickly
hurt
to
the
soul
she
read
his
tone
aright
and
came
to
lay
her
cheek
against
his
hair
listen
to
me
son
since
the
day
her
mother
gave
her
to
me
i
hoped
it
would
be
this
way
but
there
nothing
to
be
gained
by
hurry
you
but
you
would
be
glad
mother
you
do
think
that
she
might
have
me
poor
wolf
said
eagerly
and
humbly
he
was
amazed
to
see
tears
brimming
his
mother
eyes
as
she
nodded
and
turned
away
before
either
spoke
again
a
rush
in
the
hall
announced
the
girls
who
entered
the
kitchen
gasping
and
laughing
with
the
cold
whew
panted
norma
catching
wolf
hands
in
her
own
ones
i
dying
oh
wolf
feel
my
nose
she
pressed
it
against
his
forehead
oh
there
a
wind
like
a
knife
and
look
at
my
shoe
in
i
went
right
through
the
ice
oh
aunt
kate
let
me
stay
here
and
locking
both
slender
arms
about
the
older
woman
neck
she
dropped
her
dark
shining
head
upon
her
breast
like
a
bird
it
four
below
zero
in
broadway
this
minute
she
added
looking
sidewise
under
her
curling
lashes
at
wolf
who
said
so
wolf
demanded
the
man
i
bought
that
paper
from
said
so
go
back
and
ask
him
oh
joy
that
looks
good
said
norma
eyeing
the
pudding
that
was
now
being
drawn
crackling
bubbling
and
crisp
from
the
oven
rose
and
i
fell
over
the
new
lineoleum
in
the
hall
i
thought
it
was
a
dead
body
she
went
on
cheerfully
i
came
on
my
family
feature
with
such
a
noise
that
i
thought
the
woman
downstairs
would
be
rattling
the
ropes
again
long
before
this
she
stepped
to
the
and
put
her
head
into
the
shaft
what
is
it
darling
she
called
norma
behave
yourself
it
would
serve
you
good
and
right
if
she
heard
you
sheridan
said
in
a
panic
go
change
your
shoes
and
come
and
eat
your
dinner
i
believe
her
aunt
added
pausing
near
her
that
you
skin
your
nose
in
the
hall
oh
heavens
norma
exclaimed
bringing
her
face
close
to
the
dark
window
as
to
a
mirror
oh
say
it
will
be
gone
by
friday
because
on
friday
i
going
to
have
tea
with
liggett
her
husband
came
in
and
asked
me
oh
the
darling
he
certainly
is
the
well
the
most
well
i
do
know
his
voice
and
the
quiet
way
oh
for
pity
sake
go
change
your
shoes
rose
interrupted
you
are
the
biggest
idiot
i
went
into
the
store
to
get
her
rose
explained
and
i
had
all
this
once
in
the
subway
how
liggett
picks
up
his
glasses
on
their
ribbon
to
read
the
titles
of
books
oh
you
shut
up
norma
called
departing
and
unashamed
when
dinner
was
finished
and
the
table
cleared
she
produced
a
pack
of
cards
and
said
that
she
was
going
to
play
idle
and
if
i
get
it
it
mean
that
the
man
i
marry
is
going
to
look
exactly
like
chris
liggett
she
did
not
get
it
and
played
it
again
the
third
time
she
interrupted
wolf
slow
and
patient
perusal
of
the
to
announce
that
she
was
now
going
to
play
it
to
see
if
he
was
in
love
with
mary
redding
think
how
nice
that
would
be
aunt
kate
a
double
wedding
and
if
wolf
or
rose
died
and
left
a
lot
of
children
the
other
one
would
always
be
there
to
take
in
whoever
was
left
you
know
what
i
mean
you
the
one
wolf
ought
to
marry
to
make
it
complete
rose
who
was
neatly
marking
a
r
on
a
crash
towel
retaliated
neatly
i
ca
marry
my
cousin
miss
smarty
oh
do
let
a
little
thing
like
that
worry
you
wolf
said
looking
across
the
table
our
children
would
be
idiots
perhaps
they
would
be
anyway
norma
reminded
him
in
a
gale
of
laughter
her
aunt
looked
up
disapprovingly
over
her
glasses
baby
do
talk
like
that
that
not
a
nice
way
to
talk
at
all
wolf
you
lead
her
on
now
we
not
have
any
more
of
that
if
you
please
i
see
the
president
is
making
himself
very
unpopular
wolf
i
do
know
why
they
all
make
it
so
hard
for
the
poor
man
mccrea
was
in
the
market
this
morning
if
i
win
this
game
rose
by
this
time
next
year
norma
said
in
an
undertone
you
have
norma
sheridan
yes
aunt
kate
do
you
want
me
to
speak
to
you
again
no
norma
subsided
for
a
brief
space
rose
covertly
watching
the
game
presently
the
younger
girl
burst
forth
anew
listen
wolf
i
bet
you
that
i
can
get
more
words
out
of
the
letters
in
christopher
than
you
can
wolf
roused
himself
smiled
took
out
his
fountain
pen
and
reached
for
a
sheet
of
paper
he
was
always
ready
for
any
sort
of
game
norma
bending
herself
to
the
contest
put
her
pencil
into
her
mouth
and
stared
fixedly
at
the
drop
light
rose
according
to
ancient
precedent
was
permitted
to
assist
evenly
and
alternately
and
kate
watching
them
and
listening
even
while
she
drowsed
over
the
woman
page
decided
that
after
all
they
were
nothing
but
a
pack
of
children
chapter
vi
to
leslie
melrose
had
come
the
very
happiest
time
of
her
life
she
had
always
had
everything
she
wanted
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
consider
a
fortunate
marriage
engagement
as
anything
but
a
matter
of
course
in
her
case
she
was
nineteen
she
was
mad
in
her
own
terms
about
acton
liggett
and
the
engagement
was
the
natural
result
but
the
ensuing
events
were
far
more
delightful
than
leslie
had
dreamed
even
in
her
happy
dreams
all
her
world
turned
from
its
affairs
of
business
and
intrigue
and
amusement
to
centre
its
attention
upon
her
little
person
for
the
moment
and
to
shower
her
with
ten
times
enough
flattery
and
praise
to
turn
a
much
steadier
head
presents
rained
upon
leslie
and
every
one
of
them
was
astonishingly
handsome
and
valuable
newspapers
clamoured
for
her
picture
and
wherever
she
went
she
was
immediately
the
focus
for
all
eyes
that
old
judge
lee
should
send
her
some
of
his
mother
beautiful
diamonds
that
christopher
and
alice
should
order
for
her
great
crates
of
specially
woven
linen
that
were
worthy
of
a
queen
that
emanuel
massaro
the
painter
of
the
hour
should
ask
her
to
sit
for
him
were
all
just
so
much
sheer
pleasure
added
to
the
sum
total
of
her
happiness
in
loving
the
man
of
her
choice
and
knowing
herself
beloved
by
him
leslie
found
herself
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
a
person
of
importance
with
aunt
annie
too
the
social
leader
found
time
to
advise
her
little
niece
in
the
new
contingencies
that
were
perpetually
arising
lent
leslie
her
private
secretary
for
the
expeditious
making
of
lists
or
writing
of
notes
and
bullied
her
own
autocratic
modiste
into
promising
at
least
half
of
the
trousseau
it
was
annie
who
decided
that
the
marriage
must
be
at
a
certain
park
avenue
church
and
at
a
certain
hour
and
that
the
reception
at
the
house
must
be
arranged
in
a
certain
manner
and
no
other
hendrick
or
judge
lee
would
give
away
the
bride
christopher
would
be
his
brother
best
man
and
leslie
would
be
given
time
to
greet
her
guests
and
change
her
gown
and
be
driven
to
house
for
just
one
kiss
before
she
and
acton
went
away
acton
had
begged
for
an
easter
wedding
but
leslie
upon
her
advice
held
out
for
june
if
the
war
was
over
by
that
time
and
everyone
said
it
must
be
for
so
hideous
a
combat
could
not
possibly
last
more
than
six
or
eight
months
then
they
would
go
to
england
and
the
continent
but
otherwise
they
might
drift
through
canada
to
the
pacific
coast
and
even
come
back
by
san
francisco
and
the
newly
opened
canal
meanwhile
annie
entertained
her
niece
royally
and
untiringly
formal
dinners
to
old
family
friends
must
come
first
but
when
spring
arrived
leslie
was
promised
house
parties
and
yachting
trips
more
after
her
own
heart
the
girl
was
so
excited
so
bewildered
and
tired
even
after
the
first
two
weeks
that
she
remained
in
bed
until
noon
every
day
and
had
a
young
maid
especially
detailed
to
take
her
dressmaker
fittings
for
her
but
even
so
she
lost
weight
her
cheeks
burned
and
her
eyes
glittered
feverishly
and
her
voice
took
an
unnaturally
high
key
her
speech
a
certain
shallow
quickness
acton
undeviating
adoration
she
took
with
a
pretty
spoiled
acquiescence
and
with
old
family
friends
she
was
charmingly
dutiful
and
deferential
but
always
with
the
air
of
sparing
a
few
glittering
drops
to
their
age
and
dulness
from
the
overflowing
cup
of
her
youth
and
beauty
and
power
but
with
her
grandmother
and
aunts
she
had
a
new
attitude
of
and
to
her
girl
friends
she
was
no
longer
the
old
intimate
and
equal
but
a
being
who
had
for
the
moment
at
least
left
them
all
behind
she
would
show
them
the
new
silver
the
new
linens
the
frocks
that
were
in
themselves
a
trousseau
and
wish
that
doris
or
marion
or
virginia
were
engaged
too
it
was
such
fun
and
with
older
women
the
débutantes
of
six
and
eight
and
ten
years
ago
who
had
failed
of
all
this
glory
who
could
only
listen
sweetly
to
the
chatter
of
plans
and
honours
and
look
in
uncomplaining
admiration
at
the
blazing
ring
leslie
was
quite
merciless
the
number
of
times
that
she
managed
to
mention
her
age
the
fact
that
madame
modiste
had
tried
to
give
her
fittings
after
three
under
the
impression
that
she
was
a
schoolgirl
and
the
craziness
of
little
me
going
over
all
the
late
liggett
chests
of
silver
and
china
perhaps
only
these
unsuccessful
candidates
for
matrimony
could
estimate
certainly
leslie
herself
was
quite
unconscious
of
it
and
truly
believed
what
she
heard
on
all
sides
that
she
was
adorable
and
not
changed
one
bit
and
just
as
unconscious
that
there
was
anything
else
in
the
world
but
acton
as
a
little
girl
with
her
first
doll
christopher
and
alice
in
the
first
years
of
their
married
life
had
built
a
home
at
glen
cove
and
christopher
made
this
his
wedding
present
to
his
brother
necessarily
even
the
handsomest
of
country
homes
if
ten
years
old
needs
an
almost
complete
renovation
and
this
renovation
acton
and
leslie
guided
by
a
famous
architect
began
rapturously
to
plan
reserving
a
beautiful
apartment
not
far
from
alice
in
park
avenue
for
autumn
furnishing
and
refitting
all
these
activities
and
interests
kept
the
lovers
busy
and
kept
them
apart
indeed
or
united
them
only
in
groups
of
other
people
but
acton
could
bring
his
pretty
sweetheart
home
from
a
dinner
now
and
then
and
come
into
the
old
melrose
house
for
a
precious
half
hour
of
murmuring
talk
or
could
sometimes
persuade
her
to
leave
a
tea
or
a
matinée
early
enough
to
walk
a
few
blocks
with
him
in
this
fashion
they
slipped
away
from
a
box
party
one
friday
afternoon
and
found
themselves
walking
briskly
northward
into
the
neighbourhood
of
alice
house
leslie
had
had
for
several
days
a
rather
guilty
feeling
in
regard
to
this
lovely
aunt
it
was
really
hard
rising
at
noon
and
trying
to
see
and
please
so
many
persons
to
keep
in
close
touch
with
the
patient
and
uncomplaining
invalid
who
had
to
depend
wholly
upon
the
generosity
of
those
she
loved
for
knowledge
of
them
so
leslie
was
glad
to
suggest
and
acton
glad
to
agree
that
they
had
better
go
in
and
see
aunt
alice
for
a
few
minutes
as
usual
liggett
had
company
although
it
proved
only
to
be
the
pretty
miss
sheridan
who
had
called
upon
leslie
grandmother
on
the
first
day
of
that
mysterious
indisposition
that
had
kept
the
old
lady
bedridden
almost
ever
since
alice
looked
oddly
tired
but
her
eyes
were
shining
brightly
and
norma
was
charmingly
happy
and
at
ease
she
jumped
up
to
shake
hands
with
acton
with
a
bright
comment
that
he
was
not
in
the
like
his
brother
and
recalled
herself
to
leslie
before
offering
her
all
sorts
of
good
wishes
norma
hoping
that
it
would
some
day
occur
had
indeed
anticipated
this
meeting
with
leslie
by
a
little
mental
consideration
of
what
she
should
say
but
the
effect
was
so
spontaneous
and
sincere
that
the
four
were
enabled
to
settle
down
comfortably
to
tea
in
a
few
moments
like
old
friends
miss
sheridan
or
norma
rather
and
i
have
been
having
a
perfectly
delicious
talk
said
alice
she
loves
christina
rossetti
and
she
knew
the
of
heaven
by
heart
and
she
has
promised
to
send
me
a
new
man
work
that
sounds
delightful
what
was
it
something
about
general
booth
if
i
have
chattered
you
to
death
norma
said
penitentially
and
leslie
added
aunt
alice
you
look
tired
not
that
talking
poetry
ever
would
tire
you
she
hastened
to
add
with
a
smile
for
norma
no
i
not
or
rather
i
was
but
i
feel
wonderfully
alice
said
pour
the
tea
kitten
what
have
you
two
little
adventurers
been
doing
with
yourselves
dupré
party
yvette
guilbert
leslie
said
she
is
quite
too
wonderful
i
always
wanted
to
see
her
and
i
always
known
i
would
adore
her
norma
interpolated
dreamily
alice
glanced
at
her
quickly
does
she
give
another
matinée
leslie
two
leslie
looked
at
acton
is
it
two
weeks
from
she
questioned
i
send
you
seats
for
it
alice
said
making
a
little
note
on
her
ivory
memoranda
pages
as
she
nodded
to
norma
the
colour
rushed
into
norma
face
and
she
bit
her
lip
but
liggett
honestly
i
truly
did
mean
i
only
meant
she
began
to
stammer
half
laughing
alice
laid
her
hand
upon
reassuringly
my
dear
you
know
i
do
think
you
hinted
but
i
want
to
do
it
i
ca
alice
said
smiling
i
ca
do
anything
for
little
miss
aladdin
here
and
it
gives
me
the
greatest
pleasure
now
and
then
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
liggett
acton
said
got
a
grasping
nature
and
a
mean
soul
you
can
see
that
she
the
limit
all
right
he
smiled
down
at
her
as
he
gave
her
her
teacup
and
leslie
laughed
outright
acton
was
a
person
of
few
words
but
when
he
chose
to
talk
leslie
found
his
manner
amusing
christopher
coming
up
to
join
them
fifteen
minutes
later
said
that
from
the
noise
they
made
he
had
supposed
at
least
fifty
persons
to
be
in
his
wife
room
did
norma
as
she
gave
the
master
of
the
house
her
hand
have
sudden
memory
of
all
her
recent
absurd
extravagances
in
his
name
the
games
the
surmises
the
wild
statements
that
had
had
chris
liggett
as
their
inspiration
if
she
did
she
gave
no
sign
of
it
beyond
the
bright
flush
with
which
she
greeted
her
oldest
acquaintance
in
this
group
christopher
sat
down
content
to
be
a
listener
and
an
onlooker
as
he
sipped
his
tea
but
norma
saw
that
his
wife
look
of
white
fatigue
made
him
uneasy
and
immediately
said
that
she
must
go
he
made
no
protest
but
said
that
the
car
was
at
the
door
and
she
must
let
him
send
her
home
norma
agreed
and
acton
asked
if
he
and
leslie
might
not
use
it
too
the
three
departed
in
high
spirits
alice
detaining
the
radiant
and
excited
norma
long
enough
to
exact
from
her
the
promise
of
another
visit
soon
and
to
send
an
affectionate
message
to
sheridan
from
miss
alice
then
they
went
down
to
the
big
car
an
exciting
and
delightful
experience
to
norma
leslie
was
left
first
and
acton
pleading
that
he
was
already
late
for
another
engagement
was
dropped
at
his
club
then
norma
had
the
car
to
herself
and
as
it
smoothly
flew
toward
the
humble
doorway
of
the
sheridans
could
giggle
almost
aloud
in
her
pleasure
and
exhilaration
at
an
afternoon
that
had
gone
without
a
single
awkward
minute
all
pleasant
harmonious
and
vaguely
flattering
and
the
wonderful
liggett
had
asked
her
to
come
soon
again
and
had
made
that
delightful
suggestion
about
the
concert
the
name
of
yvette
guilbert
meant
little
to
norma
but
the
thought
that
alice
liggett
really
wanted
to
hold
her
friendship
was
nothing
less
than
intoxicating
she
looked
out
of
the
car
the
streets
were
bare
of
snow
now
there
was
not
a
leaf
showing
in
the
park
and
the
ground
was
dark
and
unpromising
but
a
cool
steady
wind
was
blowing
through
the
lingering
twilight
men
were
running
after
rolling
hats
and
at
least
the
milliners
windows
were
radiant
with
springtime
bloom
children
were
playing
in
street
wrapped
and
muffled
children
wild
with
joy
to
be
out
of
doors
again
and
a
tiny
frail
little
moon
was
floating
in
the
opal
sky
just
above
the
grim
line
of
roofs
norma
looked
up
at
it
and
the
pure
blowing
air
touched
her
hot
face
and
her
heart
sang
with
the
sheer
joy
of
living
chapter
vii
christopher
had
gone
down
to
the
door
with
his
brother
and
the
girls
and
had
sent
a
glance
up
and
down
the
quiet
handsome
block
feeling
in
the
moving
air
what
norma
felt
what
all
the
city
felt
the
bold
wild
promise
of
spring
he
turned
back
into
the
house
with
something
like
a
sigh
acton
and
leslie
in
their
young
happiness
were
somehow
a
little
haunting
the
butler
was
starting
upstairs
with
the
papers
christopher
took
them
from
him
and
went
back
to
alice
room
with
his
eyes
idly
following
the
headlines
the
pretty
apartment
was
somewhat
disordered
and
looked
dull
and
dark
in
the
half
light
christopher
walked
to
a
window
and
pushed
it
open
upon
its
railed
balcony
chris
whispered
his
wife
voice
thick
and
dry
in
the
gloom
aghast
in
the
instant
apprehension
of
something
wrong
he
sprang
to
her
couch
dropped
to
his
knees
and
put
an
arm
about
her
alice
what
is
it
my
darling
she
struggled
for
speech
and
he
could
see
that
her
face
was
ashen
chris
no
do
ring
chris
is
that
christopher
touched
the
chain
that
flooded
the
couch
with
rosy
light
he
bent
in
eager
sympathy
over
his
wife
relaxed
form
alice
what
is
it
he
asked
tenderly
do
worry
dear
do
try
to
talk
too
fast
just
tell
chris
what
frightened
you
alice
laughed
wretchedly
as
she
detached
the
fingers
he
had
pressed
anxiously
upon
her
forehead
no
i
not
feverish
she
assured
him
holding
tight
to
his
hand
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
chris
i
must
know
and
no
matter
what
promise
you
have
given
mother
or
given
any
one
now
now
now
he
soothed
her
i
tell
you
anything
sweetheart
only
do
let
yourself
get
so
excited
just
tell
me
what
it
is
alice
and
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
of
course
chris
she
said
swallowing
with
a
dry
throat
and
sitting
up
with
an
air
of
regaining
you
must
tell
me
you
know
you
can
trust
me
you
that
girl
but
girl
what
are
you
talking
about
dear
do
do
try
to
be
just
a
little
clearer
and
calmer
who
said
alice
with
a
ghastly
look
sweeping
the
hair
back
from
her
damp
forehead
who
is
that
norma
sheridan
why
i
told
you
dear
that
i
do
know
her
husband
protested
i
told
you
weeks
ago
after
your
mother
made
that
scene
the
night
of
hendrick
speech
that
i
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
chris
alice
was
regarding
him
fixedly
you
know
dearest
could
your
mother
simply
wish
to
befriend
a
girl
whose
parents
alice
flung
her
loosened
hair
back
and
at
her
gesture
and
her
glance
at
the
little
carafe
on
her
table
he
poured
her
a
glass
of
cold
water
drinking
it
off
and
raising
herself
in
her
cushions
she
stretched
her
hand
to
touch
the
chair
beside
her
and
still
without
a
word
indicated
that
he
was
to
take
it
with
a
face
of
grave
concern
christopher
sat
down
beside
her
holding
her
hands
in
both
his
own
chris
she
said
clearly
and
quickly
if
with
occasional
catches
of
breath
the
minute
that
girl
came
into
the
room
i
knew
that
i
knew
that
had
come
upon
us
all
i
knew
that
she
was
one
of
us
one
of
us
melroses
somehow
alice
he
said
pleadingly
but
mama
she
said
with
a
keen
look
did
tell
you
that
she
told
me
only
what
i
told
you
that
night
on
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
alice
what
makes
you
say
what
you
do
ah
chris
his
wife
cried
almost
frantically
look
at
her
at
her
why
her
voice
is
annie
the
same
identical
voice
she
looks
like
my
father
like
theodore
she
looks
like
us
all
she
and
leslie
were
so
much
alike
as
they
sat
there
in
spite
of
the
colouring
that
i
almost
screamed
it
at
them
surely
surely
you
see
it
everyone
sees
it
he
stared
at
her
beginning
to
breathe
a
little
quickly
in
his
turn
by
george
she
heard
him
whisper
as
if
to
himself
do
you
see
it
chris
alice
whispered
almost
fearfully
but
but
he
got
up
and
walked
restlessly
to
the
window
and
came
back
to
sit
down
again
but
there
a
cousinship
somewhere
he
said
sensibly
there
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
thing
ca
be
explained
i
do
think
you
taking
this
thing
pretty
hard
my
dear
what
can
you
possibly
suppose
there
might
be
a
hundred
girls
his
voice
fell
alice
was
watching
him
expectantly
mama
felt
it
saw
it
as
i
do
she
said
you
may
be
very
sure
that
mama
would
have
almost
lost
her
mind
as
she
did
unless
something
had
given
her
cause
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
in
the
utter
silence
of
the
lovely
room
alice
chris
said
in
a
puzzled
voice
after
awhile
you
suspect
me
of
keeping
something
from
you
but
on
my
honour
you
know
all
that
your
mother
told
me
all
that
i
know
oh
chris
she
said
with
a
sort
of
wail
if
i
do
know
more
her
husband
slow
colour
rose
how
could
you
know
more
he
asked
bewilderedly
alice
was
unhappily
silent
chris
if
i
tell
you
what
i
afraid
of
what
i
fear
she
said
presently
after
anxious
thought
will
you
promise
me
never
never
to
speak
of
it
never
even
to
think
of
it
if
it
if
it
proves
not
to
be
true
i
do
have
to
tell
you
that
alice
he
said
no
of
course
you
do
of
course
you
do
she
echoed
with
a
nervous
laugh
i
tell
you
what
i
think
chris
what
has
been
almost
driving
me
mad
and
you
can
probably
tell
me
a
thousand
reasons
why
it
ca
be
so
you
see
i
never
understood
mama
feverish
distress
these
last
weeks
she
been
to
see
me
she
done
what
had
to
be
done
about
leslie
engagement
but
she
not
herself
you
can
see
that
yesterday
she
began
to
cry
almost
for
nothing
and
when
i
happened
to
mention
or
rather
when
i
mentioned
very
deliberately
that
miss
sheridan
was
coming
here
she
almost
shrieked
well
i
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
and
even
then
i
rather
wondered
even
then
alice
began
again
after
a
painful
pause
and
with
her
own
voice
rising
uncontrollably
i
suspected
something
but
not
this
oh
chris
if
i
wrong
about
this
i
shall
be
on
my
knees
for
gratitude
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
would
die
i
would
die
to
have
it
just
just
my
wretched
imagination
a
thing
like
this
to
us
the
melroses
who
have
always
been
so
straight
so
respected
now
alice
now
alice
yes
i
know
she
said
quickly
i
know
and
for
a
moment
she
lay
back
quietly
stroking
his
hand
chris
she
resumed
composedly
after
a
moment
you
know
the
tragedy
of
annie
life
chris
taken
by
surprise
frowned
why
yes
i
suppose
so
he
admitted
unwillingly
chris
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
she
might
have
had
a
child
by
that
fiend
chris
looked
at
his
wife
a
moment
and
his
eyes
widened
and
his
mouth
twitched
humorously
oh
come
now
alice
come
now
you
think
it
folly
she
asked
eagerly
worse
he
answered
briefly
his
eyes
smiling
reproach
alice
whole
tense
body
relaxed
and
she
stared
at
him
with
light
dawning
in
her
eyes
well
probably
it
is
she
said
very
simply
of
course
it
is
chris
said
now
you
are
dead
tired
dear
and
you
have
let
the
thing
mill
about
in
your
head
until
you
ca
see
anything
normally
i
confess
that
i
do
understand
your
mother
mysterious
nervousness
but
then
i
am
free
to
say
that
i
do
by
any
means
always
understand
your
mother
you
remember
the
pearl
episode
and
the
time
that
she
had
annie
and
hendrick
cabling
from
italy
because
hendrick
junior
had
a
rash
and
then
there
was
porter
a
boy
nineteen
years
old
and
she
actually
had
everyone
guessing
exactly
what
she
felt
toward
him
oh
chris
no
she
did
she
simply
felt
that
he
was
a
genius
and
he
had
a
penny
alice
protested
reproachful
and
hurt
well
she
had
him
there
at
the
house
until
his
mother
came
after
him
and
then
when
he
finally
was
sent
abroad
she
asked
me
seriously
if
i
thought
two
hundred
dollars
a
month
was
enough
for
his
musical
education
yes
i
know
alice
said
ruefully
shaking
her
head
now
this
comes
along
said
christopher
encouraged
by
the
effect
of
his
words
and
you
begin
to
fret
your
poor
little
soul
with
all
sorts
of
wild
speculations
i
wish
to
the
lord
that
your
mother
was
a
little
bit
more
trusting
with
her
confidences
but
when
it
all
comes
out
prove
to
be
some
sister
of
your
grandfather
who
married
a
tailor
or
something
and
left
a
line
of
pretty
girls
to
work
in
biretta
but
chris
she
reminded
me
so
of
annie
i
almost
felt
alice
said
still
frightened
and
dubious
well
that
merely
shows
that
you
it
no
reflection
on
annie
chris
said
giving
her
her
paper
and
opening
his
own
but
alice
did
not
open
her
paper
a
maid
came
in
and
moved
about
noiselessly
setting
chairs
and
rugs
in
order
another
soft
light
was
lighted
and
the
little
square
table
set
before
the
fire
the
cool
fresh
air
drifted
in
at
the
window
and
sent
a
delicate
breath
from
alice
great
bowl
of
freesia
lilies
through
the
peaceful
room
the
fire
snapped
smartly
about
a
fresh
log
and
alice
great
cat
came
to
make
a
majestic
spring
into
her
lap
chris
i
so
worried
said
his
wife
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
christopher
quietly
after
a
while
did
annie
was
very
ill
i
know
but
was
there
was
there
any
reason
to
suppose
that
there
might
have
been
that
such
a
situation
as
might
have
arisen
alice
looked
at
him
with
apprehension
dawning
afresh
oh
yes
that
is
i
believe
so
i
did
know
it
then
of
course
i
never
knew
that
christopher
said
thoughtfully
well
i
did
at
the
time
you
know
it
was
of
course
it
was
sixteen
eighteen
years
ago
alice
said
and
in
a
whisper
she
added
chris
that
girl
is
eighteen
christopher
pursed
his
lips
to
whistle
but
made
no
sound
and
looked
into
the
fire
you
see
i
was
only
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
alice
said
i
was
going
to
miss
bennet
school
and
we
were
all
living
in
the
madison
avenue
house
papa
had
been
dead
only
a
year
or
less
for
i
remember
that
annie
was
eighteen
and
was
going
out
much
because
of
mourning
theodore
had
been
worrying
mama
to
death
and
had
left
the
house
then
and
mama
was
sending
him
and
his
wife
money
i
believe
but
of
course
lots
of
that
was
kept
from
me
annie
was
terribly
wild
and
excitable
then
always
doing
reckless
things
i
can
remember
when
she
and
belle
duer
dressed
up
as
boys
and
had
their
pictures
taken
and
once
they
put
a
matrimonial
advertisement
in
the
papers
of
course
they
were
just
silly
at
least
that
was
but
then
she
began
to
rave
about
this
man
müller
the
acrobat
christopher
who
was
listening
intently
supplied
no
dearest
he
was
their
riding
master
i
suppose
that
is
much
better
really
but
he
was
an
extremely
handsome
man
really
stunning
carry
winchester
mother
forbade
her
taking
any
more
lessons
because
was
so
wild
about
him
and
annie
told
me
once
that
that
was
why
ida
burnett
was
popped
into
a
boarding
school
he
was
big
and
dark
and
he
had
a
slight
foreign
accent
and
he
was
ever
so
much
older
than
annie
forty
at
least
she
began
to
spend
all
her
time
at
the
riding
club
it
used
to
make
mama
wild
especially
as
annie
was
so
headstrong
and
saucy
about
it
poor
mama
i
remember
her
crying
and
complaining
and
how
long
did
this
go
on
christopher
asked
oh
weeks
well
and
then
one
hot
day
just
before
easter
vacation
it
was
i
remember
i
came
home
early
from
school
with
a
headache
and
when
i
reached
the
upper
hall
i
could
hear
mama
crying
and
annie
shouting
out
loud
and
this
kate
this
very
same
kate
sheridan
trying
to
quiet
mama
and
everything
in
an
uproar
finally
i
heard
annie
sobbing
i
was
frightened
to
death
of
course
and
i
sat
down
on
the
stairs
that
go
up
to
the
nursery
and
i
heard
annie
say
something
about
being
eighteen
and
she
was
eighteen
the
very
day
before
and
she
ran
by
me
in
her
riding
clothes
with
the
derby
hat
that
girls
used
to
wear
then
and
her
hair
clubbed
on
her
neck
and
she
ran
downstairs
and
i
could
hear
her
crying
and
saying
to
herself
show
them
i
show
them
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
her
alice
finished
sadly
for
almost
two
years
she
went
out
christopher
asked
yes
she
slammed
the
door
mama
fainted
of
course
oh
chris
said
his
wife
half
crying
was
that
enough
to
make
any
one
faint
let
alone
mama
anyway
she
was
dreadfully
ill
and
they
rather
shut
me
up
about
it
and
told
everyone
that
annie
had
gone
abroad
we
had
been
living
very
quietly
you
know
and
nobody
cared
much
what
annie
did
then
and
she
really
had
gone
abroad
she
wrote
mama
from
montreal
and
she
had
been
married
to
emil
müller
in
albany
they
had
taken
a
train
there
and
were
married
that
same
afternoon
they
went
to
london
and
they
were
in
germany
and
then
then
it
all
broke
up
you
know
about
that
how
much
later
was
that
alice
considered
it
was
about
christmas
time
do
you
remember
that
i
went
to
your
mother
and
acton
and
i
got
measles
mama
was
abroad
then
and
this
kate
went
with
her
yes
that
was
that
was
one
of
the
things
i
was
just
thinking
about
annie
wrote
mama
that
she
was
very
ill
in
munich
and
poor
mama
just
flew
müller
had
left
her
indeed
there
was
a
woman
and
two
quite
big
girls
that
had
a
claim
on
him
and
if
mama
had
been
so
anxious
to
shut
it
all
up
she
might
have
proved
that
he
was
a
bigamist
but
i
do
know
that
she
was
ever
sure
judge
lee
put
the
divorce
through
for
annie
and
mama
took
her
to
the
riviera
and
petted
her
and
pulled
her
through
but
all
her
hair
came
out
and
for
weeks
they
did
think
she
would
live
she
had
brain
fever
you
see
annie
had
had
some
money
waiting
for
her
on
her
eighteenth
birthday
and
your
own
father
who
was
her
guardian
chris
had
given
her
the
check
interest
it
was
about
seven
or
eight
thousand
dollars
and
he
told
her
to
open
her
own
account
and
manage
her
own
income
from
then
on
and
we
thought
mama
and
i
that
in
some
way
müller
must
have
heard
of
it
anyway
she
never
deposited
the
check
and
when
her
money
gave
out
he
just
left
her
but
what
makes
you
think
that
her
illness
did
commence
or
entirely
brain
fever
that
she
might
have
had
a
baby
alice
asked
outright
christopher
nodded
the
point
almost
insufferably
distasteful
to
him
oh
i
know
it
alice
said
you
it
the
man
echoed
almost
in
displeasure
yes
she
told
me
herself
but
of
course
that
was
years
later
at
the
time
all
i
knew
was
that
kate
sheridan
came
home
and
came
to
see
me
at
school
and
told
me
that
mama
and
annie
were
very
well
but
that
annie
had
been
frightfully
sick
and
that
mama
would
come
back
until
annie
was
much
stronger
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
nearly
two
years
theodore
took
me
over
to
them
a
year
from
that
following
summer
and
then
annie
stayed
with
some
friends
in
england
she
was
having
a
wonderful
time
but
years
afterward
when
little
hendrick
was
coming
in
fact
she
was
here
one
day
and
she
seemed
to
feel
blue
and
finally
i
happened
to
say
that
if
motherhood
seemed
so
hard
to
a
person
like
herself
whose
husband
and
whose
whole
family
were
so
mad
with
joy
over
the
prospect
of
a
baby
what
on
earth
must
it
be
to
the
poor
girls
who
have
every
reason
to
hate
it
and
she
looked
at
me
rather
oddly
and
said
i
know
what
is
of
course
i
guessed
right
away
what
she
meant
and
i
said
not
really
and
she
said
yes
that
was
what
started
my
illness
i
had
been
so
almost
crazy
so
blue
and
lonesome
and
so
sick
with
horror
at
the
whole
thing
that
it
all
happened
too
soon
the
day
after
mama
and
kate
got
there
in
fact
and
then
she
burst
out
crying
and
said
god
it
was
that
way
i
could
have
faced
and
she
said
that
she
had
been
too
desperately
ill
to
realize
anything
but
that
afterward
at
como
when
she
was
much
better
she
asked
mama
about
it
and
mama
said
she
must
only
be
glad
that
it
was
all
over
and
try
to
think
of
it
as
a
terrible
dream
well
there
you
are
said
chris
she
herself
says
that
no
child
was
born
yes
but
chris
might
it
be
that
she
did
know
alice
submitted
timidly
her
husband
eyed
her
with
a
faint
and
thoughtful
frown
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
rather
a
fantastic
theory
dear
where
would
this
child
be
all
this
time
kate
alice
said
simply
kate
he
echoed
struck
and
alice
saw
with
a
sinking
heart
that
he
was
impressed
after
a
full
moment
of
silence
he
said
simply
you
think
this
is
the
child
chris
his
wife
cried
appealingly
i
do
say
i
think
so
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
i
hope
with
all
my
soul
that
you
do
think
so
i
afraid
he
answered
thoughtfully
that
i
do
alice
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
tightened
her
fingers
in
his
without
speaking
the
idea
being
christopher
mused
that
sheridan
brought
the
baby
home
and
has
raised
her
that
makes
miss
sheridan
norma
the
child
of
annie
and
that
german
blackguard
i
suppose
so
alice
admitted
despairingly
but
why
has
it
been
kept
quiet
all
this
time
well
that
alice
said
i
do
understand
but
this
i
sure
of
annie
has
the
faintest
suspicion
of
it
she
supposes
that
the
whole
thing
ended
with
her
terrible
illness
she
was
only
eighteen
and
younger
and
more
childish
even
than
leslie
is
oh
chris
said
alice
her
eyes
watering
is
it
horrible
to
come
to
us
of
all
people
will
everybody
know
well
it
all
depends
it
a
nasty
sort
of
business
but
i
suppose
there
no
help
for
it
how
much
does
hendrick
know
about
annie
oh
everything
that
she
does
i
know
that
annie
told
him
and
judge
lee
told
him
about
müller
and
the
divorce
or
nullification
or
whatever
it
was
there
was
nothing
left
unexplained
there
but
if
the
child
lived
she
did
know
that
only
mama
did
and
kate
oh
poor
annie
it
would
kill
her
to
have
all
that
raked
up
now
why
kate
kept
it
secret
all
these
years
i
must
say
christopher
exclaimed
that
by
george
i
hate
this
sort
of
thing
no
help
for
it
i
suppose
but
if
it
gets
out
we
shall
all
be
in
for
a
sweet
lot
of
notoriety
we
shall
just
have
to
make
terms
with
these
sheridans
and
keep
our
mouths
shut
i
did
get
the
idea
that
they
were
holding
your
mother
up
i
believe
it
more
that
she
wants
justice
done
she
would
you
know
for
the
sake
of
the
family
the
girl
herself
this
norma
evidently
has
been
raised
on
any
expectations
probably
knows
nothing
about
it
oh
i
sure
of
that
alice
agreed
eagerly
and
if
she
has
melrose
blood
in
her
you
may
be
sure
she
play
the
game
but
chris
i
stand
the
uncertainty
mama
coming
to
have
luncheon
with
me
and
i
going
to
ask
her
outright
and
if
this
norma
is
really
what
we
fear
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
well
it
hard
to
say
it
all
utterly
damnable
christopher
said
distressed
and
annie
who
let
us
all
in
for
it
gets
off
scot
free
i
wish
since
she
let
it
go
so
long
that
your
mother
had
forgotten
it
entirely
but
as
it
is
this
child
is
strictly
speaking
illegitimate
there
was
a
marriage
and
some
sort
of
divorce
whether
müller
deceived
annie
as
to
his
being
a
bachelor
or
not
a
maid
stood
in
the
doorway
melrose
mrs
liggett
oh
alice
said
in
an
animated
tone
of
pleasure
ask
her
to
come
upstairs
but
the
eyes
she
turned
to
her
husband
were
full
of
apprehension
chris
here
mama
now
shall
we
would
you
dare
use
your
own
judgment
he
had
time
to
say
hastily
before
his
mother
came
in
chapter
viii
melrose
frequently
came
in
to
join
alice
for
dinner
especially
when
she
was
aware
as
that
christopher
had
an
evening
engagement
she
was
almost
always
sure
of
finding
annie
alone
and
enjoying
the
leisurely
confidences
that
were
crowded
out
of
the
daytime
hours
she
had
had
several
weeks
of
nervous
illness
now
but
looked
better
looked
indeed
her
handsome
and
comfortable
self
as
she
received
chris
filial
kiss
on
her
forehead
and
bent
to
embrace
her
daughter
freda
carried
away
her
long
cloak
and
she
pushed
her
veil
up
to
her
forehead
and
looked
with
affectionate
concern
from
husband
to
wife
now
chris
i
spoiling
things
but
i
thought
carry
pope
told
me
that
you
were
going
to
her
dinner
before
the
opera
i
due
there
at
eight
he
said
reassuringly
and
by
the
same
token
i
ought
to
be
dressing
but
alice
and
i
have
been
loafing
along
here
comfortably
and
i
give
about
seven
dollars
to
stay
at
home
with
my
wife
he
always
says
that
alice
said
smilingly
but
he
always
has
a
nice
time
and
then
the
next
night
he
plays
over
the
whole
score
and
tells
me
who
was
there
and
so
i
have
it
too
chris
had
walked
to
the
white
mantelpiece
and
was
lighting
a
cigarette
alice
had
that
little
protégée
of
yours
here
aunt
marianna
he
said
casually
there
was
no
mistaking
the
look
of
miserable
and
fearful
interest
that
deepened
instantly
in
the
older
woman
eyes
miss
sheridan
she
said
mama
alice
exclaimed
suddenly
clasping
a
warm
hand
over
her
mother
trembling
one
and
looking
at
her
with
all
love
and
reassurance
you
know
how
chris
and
i
love
you
do
you
tears
came
into
melrose
eyes
of
course
i
do
lovey
she
faltered
mama
you
know
how
we
would
stand
behind
you
how
anxious
we
are
to
share
whatever
worrying
you
alice
went
on
pleadingly
you
i
not
busy
like
annie
or
young
like
leslie
and
chris
is
your
man
of
business
after
all
ca
you
tell
us
about
it
two
heads
three
heads
said
alice
smiling
through
a
sudden
mist
of
tears
are
better
than
one
why
melrose
stammered
with
a
rather
feeble
attempt
at
lightness
have
i
been
acting
like
a
person
with
something
on
her
mind
it
nothing
children
nothing
at
all
do
bother
your
dear
generous
hearts
about
it
another
second
and
she
looked
from
one
to
another
with
a
gallant
smile
chris
eyed
his
wife
with
a
faint
hopeless
movement
of
the
head
and
alice
correctly
interpreted
it
to
mean
that
the
situation
was
worse
instead
of
better
you
remember
the
night
you
sent
for
me
some
weeks
ago
aunt
marianna
he
ventured
melrose
moistened
her
lips
and
swallowed
with
a
dry
throat
looking
at
him
with
a
sort
of
alert
defiance
i
confess
that
i
was
all
upset
that
night
she
admitted
bravely
and
to
tell
you
children
the
truth
kate
sheridan
coming
upon
me
so
unexpectedly
joseph
quite
innocently
told
me
that
evening
that
you
had
anticipated
her
coming
christopher
said
quietly
as
she
paused
joseph
was
mistaken
melrose
said
warmly
with
red
colour
beginning
to
burn
in
her
soft
faded
old
face
kate
had
been
associated
with
a
terrible
time
in
my
life
she
went
on
almost
angrily
and
it
was
quite
natural
or
at
least
it
seems
so
to
me
i
do
know
what
other
people
would
feel
but
to
but
what
are
you
two
me
for
she
interrupted
herself
to
ask
with
a
sudden
rush
of
tears
as
chris
looked
unconvinced
and
alice
still
watched
her
sorrowfully
little
do
you
know
either
of
you
what
i
have
been
through
mama
entreated
alice
earnestly
will
you
answer
me
one
question
i
promise
you
that
i
wo
ask
another
you
know
how
anxious
we
are
only
to
help
you
to
make
everything
run
smoothly
you
know
what
the
family
is
to
us
do
you
we
are
alice
asked
suddenly
seeing
that
the
desire
for
sympathy
and
advice
was
rapidly
breaking
up
the
ice
that
had
chilled
her
mother
heart
for
long
weeks
wo
you
tell
me
just
this
it
about
annie
mama
when
she
was
so
ill
in
munich
was
was
her
little
baby
born
there
yes
melrose
whispered
with
fascinated
eyes
fixed
on
her
daughter
face
alice
ashen
faced
fell
back
against
her
pillows
without
speaking
kate
sheridan
brought
the
child
home
christopher
stated
rather
than
asked
very
quietly
his
looked
at
him
apathetically
kate
yes
does
annie
know
it
mama
alice
whispered
after
a
silence
annie
oh
my
god
no
the
mother
voice
rose
almost
to
a
wail
oh
chris
alice
if
you
love
me
annie
must
not
know
so
proud
so
happy
and
she
would
never
bear
it
i
know
her
i
know
her
she
would
kill
herself
before
darling
you
must
be
quiet
alice
said
commandingly
no
one
shall
know
it
what
we
do
for
this
child
shall
be
done
for
well
our
cousin
chris
will
help
you
manage
everything
and
no
one
shall
ever
suspect
it
from
me
it
will
all
work
out
right
you
see
other
people
watching
us
as
we
always
think
they
are
it
nobody
business
if
a
cousin
of
ours
suddenly
appears
in
the
family
no
one
would
dare
whisper
one
word
against
the
melroses
only
be
quiet
mama
darling
and
worry
now
that
we
know
it
we
will
never
never
allude
to
it
again
will
we
chris
you
can
trust
us
melrose
had
sunk
back
into
her
chair
her
face
was
beads
of
water
stood
on
her
forehead
oh
the
relief
the
relief
she
kept
whispering
as
she
clung
to
alice
hand
alice
for
the
sake
of
the
name
dear
for
all
our
sakes
now
if
you
two
girls
will
take
my
advice
christopher
suggested
cheerfully
you
stop
talking
about
all
this
and
let
it
wait
until
then
we
consult
and
see
just
what
proposition
we
can
make
to
little
miss
sheridan
and
what
best
to
be
done
alice
why
you
go
over
that
wedding
list
of
leslie
with
your
mother
and
ring
for
dinner
i
going
to
dress
we
will
alice
agreed
sensibly
as
a
family
we
always
faced
things
courageously
we
fighters
we
melroses
and
we
stand
together
chapter
ix
this
was
on
friday
and
it
was
on
the
following
monday
that
wolf
and
rose
sheridan
came
home
to
find
news
awaiting
them
the
day
before
had
been
surprisingly
sunny
and
sweet
and
wolf
and
harry
redding
had
taken
the
girls
to
newark
where
wolf
had
been
stored
all
winter
and
they
had
laughed
and
joked
and
chattered
all
the
way
like
the
young
things
they
were
sheridan
urged
to
join
them
had
pleaded
business
she
had
promised
old
melrose
to
go
and
see
her
so
she
had
left
them
at
the
church
door
after
mass
and
they
had
gone
their
way
rejoicing
in
sunshine
and
warm
breezes
a
part
of
the
streaming
holiday
crowds
that
were
surging
and
idling
along
the
drying
pavements
wolf
was
neither
of
an
age
nor
type
for
piety
but
he
had
prayed
that
this
little
norma
kneeling
beside
him
with
the
youth
and
fire
and
audacity
shining
in
her
face
even
while
she
prayed
might
turn
that
same
mysterious
and
solemn
smile
upon
him
again
some
day
as
his
wife
and
all
day
long
as
she
danced
along
by
his
side
as
she
eagerly
debated
the
question
of
luncheon
as
she
enslaved
the
aged
coloured
man
in
the
garage
the
new
thrill
of
which
he
had
only
recently
become
so
pleasantly
conscious
stirred
in
his
heart
and
whatever
she
touched
or
said
or
looked
was
beautified
almost
beyond
recognition
he
had
thought
coming
home
monday
night
that
he
and
she
would
take
a
little
walk
in
the
lingering
dusk
of
the
cool
spring
evening
and
perhaps
see
the
twelfth
installment
of
the
terror
which
was
playing
in
the
house
but
he
found
her
in
a
new
mood
almost
awed
with
an
unexpected
ecstasy
in
which
he
had
no
part
would
never
have
a
part
she
and
aunt
kate
had
been
to
see
melrose
again
and
wolf
what
do
you
think
they
want
me
to
go
live
there
with
the
liggetts
to
help
with
lists
and
things
for
leslie
wedding
melrose
kissed
me
wolf
and
said
did
she
aunt
kate
that
i
must
try
to
feel
that
i
belong
to
them
and
she
was
so
sweet
she
put
her
arm
about
me
and
said
that
i
must
have
some
pretty
clothes
and
the
car
is
coming
for
me
on
wednesday
is
it
like
a
dream
oh
rose
if
thankful
enough
and
i
to
come
back
here
for
dinner
once
a
week
and
of
course
you
and
rose
are
to
come
there
oh
rose
but
i
wish
it
was
us
both
i
wish
it
was
you
you
so
good
i
would
have
it
norma
rose
said
in
her
honest
pleasant
voice
you
know
i
feel
like
a
fool
oh
but
i
am
so
happy
and
norma
who
had
gotten
into
aunt
kate
lap
as
the
marvellous
narrative
progressed
dug
her
face
into
aunt
motherly
soft
shoulder
and
tightened
her
arms
about
her
neck
and
cried
a
little
for
sheer
joy
but
wolf
said
almost
nothing
and
when
he
went
to
wash
his
hands
for
supper
he
went
slowly
and
found
himself
staring
absently
at
the
towel
and
stopping
short
in
the
hall
still
staring
he
seemed
himself
at
dinner
and
his
mother
at
first
watching
him
anxiously
could
resume
her
meal
and
later
could
fall
asleep
in
the
confident
hope
that
it
would
all
come
right
after
all
but
wolf
slipped
from
the
house
after
awhile
and
walked
the
streets
until
almost
dawn
it
was
almost
dawn
too
when
the
old
mistress
of
the
melrose
mansion
fell
asleep
she
had
called
regina
more
than
once
she
had
tried
the
effect
of
reading
and
of
hot
milk
and
of
a
cold
but
still
the
crowded
room
was
filled
with
ghosts
and
still
she
watched
them
pleaded
with
them
blamed
them
i
done
all
i
could
she
whispered
at
last
into
the
heavy
dark
before
the
dawn
it
is
my
fault
if
they
think
she
annie
child
i
never
said
so
it
was
alice
and
chris
who
said
so
annie
and
leslie
will
never
know
anything
more
and
the
girl
herself
need
never
know
anything
at
all
perhaps
as
kate
said
yesterday
it
will
all
work
out
right
this
way
at
least
it
all
we
can
do
now
chapter
x
so
it
came
about
quite
naturally
that
the
little
unknown
cousin
of
the
melroses
was
made
a
familiar
figure
in
their
different
family
groups
and
friends
of
the
house
grew
accustomed
to
finding
pretty
little
norma
sheridan
lunching
with
leslie
reading
beside
alice
couch
in
the
late
summer
afternoons
or
amusing
and
delighting
the
old
head
of
the
family
in
a
hundred
charming
ways
norma
called
melrose
aunt
marianna
now
as
chris
and
acton
did
she
did
not
understand
the
miracle
it
remained
a
marvel
still
but
it
was
enough
that
it
continued
to
deepen
and
spread
with
every
enchanted
hour
she
had
longed
what
girl
in
biretta
bookstore
did
not
to
be
rich
and
to
move
and
have
her
being
in
society
and
now
she
had
her
wish
a
hundred
times
fulfilled
and
of
course
she
was
utterly
and
absolutely
happy
that
is
except
for
the
momentary
embarrassments
and
jealousies
and
uncertainties
and
for
sometimes
being
bored
she
thought
that
she
might
consider
herself
happy
and
there
were
crumpled
everywhere
she
reminded
herself
sternly
she
norma
sheridan
could
spend
more
money
upon
the
single
item
of
shoes
for
example
than
miss
smith
head
of
biretta
bookshop
could
earn
in
a
whole
long
year
of
hot
months
and
cold
of
weary
days
and
headachy
days
that
part
of
it
was
fun
she
admitted
to
herself
the
clothes
were
fun
the
boxes
and
boxes
and
boxes
that
came
home
for
her
the
petticoats
and
stockings
the
nightgowns
heavy
with
filet
lace
and
the
rough
boots
for
tramping
and
driving
and
the
silk
and
satin
slippers
for
the
house
nothing
disappointing
there
norma
never
would
forget
the
ecstasies
of
those
first
shopping
trips
with
aunt
marianna
did
she
want
them
the
beaded
bag
the
woolly
scarf
the
little
saucy
hat
were
all
to
be
sent
to
miss
sheridan
please
norma
lost
her
breath
and
laughed
and
caught
it
again
and
lost
it
afresh
they
had
so
quickly
dropped
the
little
pretence
that
she
was
to
make
herself
useful
these
wonderful
and
generous
melroses
they
had
so
soon
forgotten
everything
except
that
she
was
leslie
age
and
to
be
petted
and
spoiled
as
if
she
had
been
another
leslie
and
now
after
more
than
half
a
year
she
knew
that
they
liked
her
that
all
of
them
liked
her
in
their
varying
degrees
old
melrose
and
alice
christopher
liggett
were
most
warmly
her
champions
perhaps
but
leslie
was
too
unformed
a
character
to
be
definitely
hostile
and
the
little
earlier
jealousies
and
misunderstandings
were
blown
away
long
ago
and
even
the
annie
had
shown
a
real
friendliness
of
late
acton
liggett
and
hendrick
von
behrens
were
always
kind
and
admiring
and
norma
had
swiftly
captivated
annie
little
boys
but
of
them
all
she
still
liked
chris
liggett
the
best
and
felt
nearest
chris
even
when
he
scolded
her
or
hurt
her
feelings
with
his
frank
advice
and
she
knew
that
chris
thoroughly
liked
her
in
spite
of
the
mistakes
that
she
was
continually
making
and
the
absurd
ways
in
which
her
ignorance
and
strangeness
still
occasionally
betrayed
her
it
had
been
a
time
full
of
mistakes
of
course
chris
often
told
her
that
she
had
more
brains
in
her
little
finger
than
most
of
the
girls
of
her
set
had
in
their
whole
bodies
but
that
had
not
saved
her
if
she
was
pretty
they
were
all
pretty
too
if
she
wore
beautiful
clothes
they
wore
clothes
just
as
beautiful
and
with
more
assurance
if
her
wit
was
quick
and
her
common
sense
and
human
experience
far
greater
than
theirs
these
were
just
the
qualities
they
neither
needed
nor
trusted
they
spoke
their
own
language
the
language
of
youthful
arrogance
and
ignorance
the
language
of
mutual
compliments
and
small
personalities
and
norma
could
not
speak
this
tongue
any
more
than
she
could
join
them
when
they
broke
easily
into
french
or
german
or
italian
she
could
ride
because
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
cobs
that
were
used
at
the
riding
school
and
in
the
park
but
she
knew
little
of
correct
posture
and
proper
handling
of
reins
she
could
swim
as
wolf
had
taught
her
in
the
old
river
years
ago
but
she
knew
nothing
of
the
terms
and
affectations
of
properly
taught
swimming
when
she
went
to
see
aunt
kate
she
was
almost
ashamed
of
the
splendour
of
her
clothing
and
the
utter
luxury
of
the
life
she
led
but
with
leslie
and
her
friends
she
often
felt
herself
what
perhaps
they
thought
her
an
insignificant
little
poor
relation
of
the
melroses
who
had
appeared
from
nobody
knew
where
and
might
return
unchallenged
at
any
moment
to
her
original
obscurity
this
phase
of
the
new
life
was
disappointing
and
norma
realized
herself
that
she
spent
a
quite
disproportionate
amount
of
time
in
thinking
about
it
was
it
enough
she
would
ask
herself
impatiently
to
be
one
of
them
at
all
to
see
one
picture
in
the
fashionable
weeklies
as
a
member
of
the
family
at
the
wedding
to
have
clothes
and
and
a
bedroom
that
was
like
a
picture
to
know
newport
at
to
have
cruised
for
a
week
in
the
craigies
yacht
and
have
driven
to
quebec
and
back
in
the
von
behrens
car
a
year
ago
she
reminded
herself
it
would
have
seemed
paradise
to
have
had
even
a
week
freedom
from
the
bookshop
now
she
need
never
step
into
biretta
again
but
it
was
not
enough
and
norma
would
come
impatiently
to
the
end
of
her
pondering
with
the
same
fretted
sense
of
dissatisfaction
it
was
not
enough
to
be
tremulously
praised
by
old
aunt
marianna
to
be
joked
by
chris
greeted
by
alice
his
wife
with
a
friendly
smile
norma
wanted
to
belong
to
this
life
to
be
admired
and
sought
by
leslie
rather
than
endured
to
have
the
same
easy
familiarity
with
duers
and
alexanders
and
rutgers
that
leslie
had
as
was
quite
natural
she
and
leslie
had
eyed
each
other
from
the
very
beginning
somewhat
as
rivals
but
leslie
even
then
preparing
for
her
marriage
had
so
obviously
held
all
the
advantages
that
her
vague
resentment
and
curiosity
concerning
the
family
treatment
of
the
unknown
newcomer
were
brief
if
aunt
alice
liked
norma
to
come
in
and
talk
books
and
write
notes
if
chris
chose
to
be
gallant
if
grandma
lavished
an
unusual
affection
upon
this
new
protégée
well
it
robbed
leslie
of
nothing
after
all
but
with
norma
it
was
different
she
was
brought
into
sharp
contact
with
another
girl
only
slightly
her
senior
who
had
everything
that
this
new
turn
of
fortune
had
given
norma
herself
and
a
thousand
times
more
norma
saw
older
women
the
important
and
influential
matrons
of
the
social
world
paying
court
to
the
promised
wife
of
acton
liggett
norma
knew
that
while
alice
and
chris
were
always
attentive
to
her
own
little
affairs
the
solving
of
leslie
problems
they
regarded
as
their
own
sacred
obligation
norma
had
hours
and
hours
of
this
new
enchanting
leisure
to
fill
she
could
be
at
anybody
beck
and
call
but
leslie
she
saw
was
only
too
busy
everybody
was
claiming
leslie
she
was
needed
in
forty
places
at
once
she
must
fly
from
one
obligation
to
another
and
be
thanked
for
sparing
just
a
few
minutes
here
and
there
from
her
crowded
days
melrose
had
immediately
made
norma
an
allowance
an
allowance
so
big
that
when
norma
first
told
aunt
kate
about
it
it
was
with
a
sense
of
shame
norma
had
her
and
need
ask
nobody
for
spending
money
more
than
that
her
generous
old
patron
insisted
that
she
use
all
the
family
charge
accounts
freely
you
must
think
of
paying
in
any
shop
said
aunt
marianna
and
aunt
alice
earnestly
but
leslie
was
immensely
rich
in
her
own
right
the
hour
in
which
norma
realized
this
was
one
of
real
wretchedness
chris
was
her
innocent
informant
it
was
only
two
or
three
days
before
the
wedding
a
warm
day
of
rustling
leaves
and
moving
shadows
in
late
may
the
united
families
were
still
in
town
but
plans
for
escape
to
the
country
were
made
for
the
very
day
after
the
event
norma
had
been
fighting
a
little
sense
of
hurt
pride
because
she
was
not
to
be
included
among
leslie
wedding
attendants
she
knew
that
aunt
marianna
had
suggested
it
to
leslie
some
weeks
before
and
that
the
bride
had
quite
justifiably
reminded
her
grandmother
that
the
eight
maids
the
special
maid
and
matron
of
honour
and
the
two
little
pages
had
all
been
already
asked
to
perform
their
little
service
of
affection
and
that
a
readjustment
now
would
be
difficult
so
norma
had
been
excluded
from
the
luncheons
the
discussions
of
frocks
and
bouquets
and
the
final
exciting
rehearsals
in
the
big
park
avenue
church
she
had
chanced
to
be
thinking
of
all
these
things
on
the
day
when
chris
made
a
casual
allusion
to
needing
leslie
the
poor
kid
has
got
a
stupid
morning
coming
i
afraid
he
had
said
adding
in
answer
to
norma
raised
eyebrows
business
she
has
to
sign
some
papers
and
alter
her
will
and
i
want
all
that
done
before
they
go
away
has
leslie
a
will
norma
had
asked
my
child
what
did
you
suppose
she
had
leslie
inherited
practically
all
of
her
grandfather
melrose
estate
at
least
her
father
theodore
did
and
leslie
gets
it
direct
through
him
of
course
your
aunt
annie
got
her
slice
and
my
wife
hers
but
the
bulk
was
left
to
the
son
poor
teddy
he
did
get
much
out
of
it
but
during
her
minority
the
executors
of
which
i
happen
to
be
one
almost
doubled
it
for
leslie
and
judge
lee
and
i
have
got
to
go
over
certain
matters
with
her
he
had
been
idling
at
the
piano
while
alice
dozed
in
the
heat
and
norma
played
with
a
magazine
now
he
had
turned
back
to
his
music
and
norma
had
apparently
resumed
her
reading
but
she
really
had
been
shaken
by
a
storm
of
passionate
jealousy
jealousy
is
in
its
nature
selfish
and
the
old
norma
of
aunt
little
group
had
not
been
a
selfish
girl
but
norma
had
had
a
few
weeks
now
of
a
world
governed
by
a
different
standard
there
was
no
necessity
here
none
of
the
pure
beauty
of
sacrifice
and
service
and
insufficiency
this
was
a
world
of
superfluities
a
standard
of
excess
to
have
merely
meals
clothing
comfort
and
ease
was
not
enough
here
all
these
must
be
had
in
superabundance
and
she
was
the
best
woman
and
the
happiest
who
had
gowns
she
could
not
wear
jewels
lying
idle
money
stored
away
in
banks
and
servants
standing
about
uselessly
for
hours
that
the
momentary
needs
of
them
might
be
instantly
met
the
poison
of
this
creed
had
reached
norma
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
young
and
she
had
always
been
beloved
in
her
own
group
for
what
she
honestly
gave
of
cheer
and
service
and
friendship
it
hurt
her
that
nobody
needed
what
she
could
give
now
and
she
hated
the
very
memory
of
leslie
wedding
but
when
that
was
over
melrose
had
taken
her
to
newport
whither
alice
was
carefully
moved
every
june
leslie
was
gone
now
and
norma
free
from
pricking
reminders
of
her
supremacy
and
as
old
friends
of
melrose
began
to
include
her
in
the
summer
merrymaking
she
had
some
happy
times
but
even
here
the
cloven
hoof
intruded
norma
had
always
imagined
this
group
as
being
full
of
friendly
women
and
admiring
men
as
offering
her
a
hundred
friendships
where
the
old
life
had
offered
one
she
discovered
slowly
and
with
pained
surprise
that
although
there
were
plenty
of
girls
they
were
not
especially
anxious
for
intimacy
with
her
and
that
the
men
she
met
were
not
somehow
real
they
were
absorbed
in
amusement
polo
and
yachting
they
moved
about
a
great
deal
and
they
neither
had
nor
desired
to
have
any
genuine
work
or
interest
in
life
she
began
to
see
leslie
wisdom
in
making
an
early
and
suitable
marriage
as
a
matron
leslie
was
established
she
could
entertain
she
had
dignified
duties
and
interests
and
while
norma
felt
awkward
and
bashful
in
asking
young
men
to
dine
with
aunt
marianna
acton
brought
his
friends
to
his
home
and
leslie
had
her
girl
friends
there
and
the
whole
thing
was
infinitely
simpler
and
pleasanter
chapter
xi
norma
had
indeed
chanced
to
make
one
girl
friend
and
one
of
whom
leslie
and
alice
and
even
annie
heartily
approved
caroline
the
daughter
of
the
peter
craigies
was
not
a
débutante
yet
but
she
would
be
the
most
prominent
because
the
richest
of
them
all
next
winter
caroline
was
a
girl
whose
chief
companions
in
life
had
been
servants
governesses
and
norma
had
been
seated
next
to
her
at
the
international
tennis
tournament
and
had
befriended
the
squirming
and
bashful
caroline
from
sheer
goodness
of
heart
they
had
criticized
the
players
and
caroline
had
laughed
the
almost
hysteric
shaken
laugh
that
so
worried
her
mother
and
had
blurted
confidences
to
norma
in
her
childish
way
the
next
day
there
had
been
an
invitation
for
norma
to
lunch
with
caroline
and
von
behrens
had
promptly
given
another
luncheon
for
both
girls
norma
was
pleased
for
a
few
weeks
with
her
first
social
conquest
but
after
that
caroline
became
a
dead
weight
upon
her
she
hated
the
flattery
the
inanities
the
utter
dulness
of
the
great
craigie
mansion
and
she
began
to
have
a
restless
conviction
that
time
spent
with
caroline
was
time
lost
the
friendship
had
cost
her
dear
too
norma
hated
even
months
later
to
remember
just
what
she
had
paid
for
it
in
august
a
letter
from
rose
had
reached
her
at
newport
announcing
rose
approaching
marriage
harry
redding
sister
mary
was
engaged
to
a
most
satisfactory
young
man
of
italian
lineage
one
joe
popini
and
redding
would
hereafter
divide
her
time
between
the
households
of
her
daughter
and
her
son
harry
thus
free
to
marry
had
persuaded
rose
to
wait
no
longer
the
event
was
to
be
on
a
monday
not
quite
two
weeks
ahead
and
norma
was
please
please
to
come
down
as
soon
as
she
could
norma
had
read
this
letter
with
a
sensation
of
pain
at
her
heart
she
felt
so
far
away
from
them
nowadays
she
felt
almost
a
certain
reluctance
to
dovetail
this
life
of
softness
and
perfume
and
amusement
in
upon
the
old
life
but
she
would
go
she
would
go
of
course
and
then
she
had
suddenly
remembered
that
on
the
monday
before
wedding
the
craigies
splendid
yacht
was
to
put
to
sea
for
a
or
cruise
and
that
caroline
had
asked
her
to
go
the
only
other
young
person
besides
the
daughter
of
the
house
and
great
persons
were
going
visiting
nobility
from
england
a
young
american
croesus
and
his
wife
a
tenor
from
the
metropolitan
annie
had
been
delighted
with
this
invitation
even
leslie
just
returned
from
california
and
hawaii
had
expressed
an
almost
surprised
satisfaction
in
the
friendliness
if
they
got
back
friday
night
then
norma
could
go
down
to
the
city
early
saturday
morning
and
have
two
days
with
rose
and
aunt
kate
but
if
the
yacht
did
not
return
until
saturday
well
even
then
there
would
be
time
she
and
rose
could
get
through
a
tremendous
lot
of
talking
in
hours
and
the
voyage
certainly
would
not
be
prolonged
over
saturday
for
had
not
craigie
said
in
norma
hearing
that
saturday
was
the
very
latest
minute
to
which
she
could
postpone
the
meeting
for
the
big
charity
lawn
party
so
norma
and
the
enslaved
caroline
continued
to
plan
for
their
sea
trip
and
norma
commissioned
chris
to
order
rose
wedding
present
at
gorham
von
behrens
had
been
a
trifle
distant
with
the
newcomer
in
the
family
until
now
but
the
day
before
the
cruise
began
she
extended
just
a
little
of
her
royal
graciousness
toward
norma
like
leslie
norma
admired
her
aunt
annie
enormously
and
hungered
for
her
most
casual
word
you
plenty
of
frocks
kiddie
asked
annie
one
uses
them
up
at
the
rate
of
about
three
a
day
oh
norma
widened
her
innocent
eyes
i
a
wardrobe
trunk
full
of
them
white
skirts
and
white
shoes
and
hats
well
i
did
suppose
you
had
them
tied
in
a
handkerchief
annie
had
responded
with
her
quiet
smile
see
if
that
fits
you
they
had
been
up
in
von
behrens
big
bedroom
where
that
lady
was
looking
at
a
newly
arrived
box
of
gowns
that
was
the
frail
embroidered
coat
of
what
norma
thought
the
prettiest
linen
suit
she
had
ever
seen
it
charming
on
you
you
little
slender
thing
annie
had
said
the
skirt
will
be
too
long
will
you
pin
it
keating
and
see
that
it
goes
at
once
to
my
mother
house
keating
had
pinned
admired
and
norma
turning
herself
before
the
mirror
with
her
eyes
shy
with
pleasure
and
gratitude
had
known
that
she
was
gaining
ground
so
they
had
started
radiantly
on
the
cruise
but
after
the
first
few
miraculous
hours
of
gliding
along
beneath
the
gay
awnings
that
had
all
been
almost
astonishingly
disappointing
too
caroline
to
begin
with
was
a
dreadful
weight
upon
her
young
guest
caroline
for
breakfast
luncheon
and
dinner
caroline
retiring
and
rising
became
almost
hateful
caroline
always
wanted
to
do
something
when
norma
could
have
dreamed
and
idled
in
her
deck
chair
by
the
hour
it
must
be
deck
golf
or
deck
tennis
or
they
must
go
up
and
tease
dignified
and
courteous
captain
burns
because
he
was
such
an
old
duck
or
they
must
harass
one
or
two
of
the
older
people
into
bridge
norma
did
not
play
bridge
well
and
she
hated
it
and
hated
caroline
way
of
paying
for
her
losses
almost
more
than
paying
them
herself
norma
could
not
lie
lazily
with
her
book
raising
her
eyes
to
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
slowly
tipping
sea
revelling
in
coolness
and
airiness
because
caroline
fussing
beside
her
had
never
read
a
book
through
in
her
life
the
guest
did
not
know
even
now
that
caroline
had
been
a
mental
problem
for
years
that
caroline
family
had
consulted
great
about
her
and
had
watched
the
her
odd
slyness
her
hysteric
emotions
with
deep
concern
she
did
not
know
even
now
that
the
cragies
were
anxious
to
encourage
this
first
reaching
out
in
caroline
toward
a
member
of
her
own
sex
and
that
her
fancies
for
members
of
the
opposite
sex
for
severely
indifferent
teachers
for
shocked
and
unresponsive
chauffeurs
were
among
the
family
problems
a
part
of
the
unfortunate
caroline
family
was
innocently
surprised
to
realize
that
her
mind
had
not
developed
under
the
care
of
maids
who
were
absorbed
in
their
own
affairs
and
foreigners
who
would
not
have
been
free
to
attend
her
had
they
not
been
impecunious
and
unsuccessful
in
more
lucrative
ways
they
had
left
her
to
mademoiselles
and
fräuleins
quite
complacently
but
they
did
not
wish
her
to
be
like
these
or
ladies
so
they
welcomed
her
friendship
with
norma
and
caroline
passionate
desire
to
be
with
her
friend
was
not
to
find
any
opposition
on
the
part
of
her
own
family
little
miss
sheridan
had
an
occasional
kindly
word
from
caroline
mother
a
stout
woman
at
and
smiles
from
caroline
father
a
young
man
and
socially
this
meant
that
the
melroses
young
protégée
was
made
but
norma
did
not
realize
all
this
she
only
knew
that
all
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
yacht
were
wasted
on
her
everyone
ate
too
much
talked
too
much
played
flirted
and
dressed
too
much
the
women
seldom
made
their
appearance
until
noon
in
the
afternoons
there
was
bridge
until
six
and
much
squabbling
and
writing
of
checks
on
the
forward
deck
with
iced
drinks
continually
being
brought
up
from
the
bar
at
six
the
women
loitered
off
to
dress
for
dinner
but
the
men
went
on
playing
for
another
half
hour
the
sun
sank
in
a
blaze
of
splendour
the
wonderful
twilight
fell
but
the
yacht
might
have
been
boxed
up
in
an
armoury
for
all
that
her
passengers
saw
of
the
sea
after
the
elaborate
dinner
with
its
ices
and
hot
rolls
its
warm
wines
and
chilled
champagne
cards
began
again
and
unless
the
ocean
was
so
still
that
they
might
dance
bridge
continued
until
after
midnight
norma
happiest
times
had
been
when
she
arose
early
at
perhaps
seven
and
after
dressing
noiselessly
in
their
little
bathroom
crept
upstairs
without
waking
caroline
sunshine
would
be
flooding
the
ocean
or
perhaps
the
vessel
would
be
nosing
her
way
through
a
luminous
fog
but
it
was
always
beautiful
the
decks
drying
in
the
soft
air
would
be
ordered
inviting
deserted
great
waves
of
smooth
water
would
flow
evenly
past
curving
themselves
with
lessening
ripples
into
the
great
even
circle
of
the
sea
a
gentle
breeze
would
stir
the
leaves
of
the
potted
plants
on
the
deck
and
flap
the
fringes
of
the
awnings
norma
hanging
on
the
railing
would
look
down
upon
a
group
of
maids
and
stewards
laughing
and
talking
on
the
open
deck
below
these
were
happy
she
would
reflect
animated
by
a
thousand
honest
emotions
that
never
crept
to
the
luxurious
cabins
above
they
would
be
waiting
for
breakfast
all
freshly
aproned
and
brushed
all
as
pleased
with
the
as
if
they
had
been
her
owners
on
the
fifth
day
friday
she
had
been
almost
sick
with
longing
to
hear
some
mention
of
going
back
surely
surely
she
reasoned
they
had
all
said
that
they
must
get
back
on
friday
night
if
the
plan
had
changed
norma
had
determined
to
ask
them
to
run
into
harbour
somewhere
and
put
her
on
shore
she
was
so
tired
of
caroline
so
tired
of
wasting
time
so
headachy
from
the
heavy
meals
and
lack
of
exercise
late
on
friday
afternoon
some
idle
remark
of
her
hostess
had
assured
her
that
the
yacht
would
not
make
greble
light
until
monday
they
were
ploughing
north
now
to
play
along
the
maine
coast
the
yachting
party
was
a
great
success
and
nobody
wanted
to
go
home
norma
goaded
out
of
her
customary
shyness
had
pleaded
her
marriage
could
they
run
into
portland
or
somewhere
and
let
her
go
down
by
train
but
caroline
had
protested
most
affectionately
and
noisily
against
this
and
caroline
mother
said
sweetly
that
she
could
think
of
letting
norma
do
that
alone
annie
von
behrens
would
never
forgive
her
however
she
would
speak
to
captain
burns
and
see
what
could
be
done
anyway
craigie
had
finished
with
her
comfortable
laugh
norma
had
only
to
tell
her
cousin
that
she
was
out
with
friends
on
their
yacht
and
they
had
been
delayed
surely
that
was
excuse
enough
for
any
one
it
was
with
difficulty
that
norma
had
kept
the
tears
out
of
her
eyes
she
had
not
wanted
an
excuse
to
stay
away
from
rose
wedding
her
heart
had
burned
with
shame
and
anger
and
helplessness
she
could
hardly
believe
crying
herself
to
sleep
on
friday
night
that
two
whole
days
were
still
to
spare
before
monday
and
that
she
was
helpless
to
use
them
her
mind
worked
madly
her
thoughts
rushing
to
and
fro
with
a
desperation
worthy
an
actual
prisoner
on
saturday
evening
after
a
day
of
such
homesickness
and
as
she
had
never
known
before
in
her
life
she
had
realized
that
they
were
in
some
port
lying
a
short
half
mile
from
shore
it
was
about
ten
warm
and
there
was
no
moon
norma
had
slipped
from
the
deck
where
caroline
was
playing
bridge
and
had
gone
to
the
lowered
captain
burns
was
there
going
over
what
appeared
to
be
invoices
with
the
head
steward
captain
norma
had
said
her
heart
pounding
ca
you
put
me
on
shore
i
must
be
in
new
york
it
very
important
if
i
get
a
coat
will
you
let
me
go
in
when
you
go
he
had
measured
her
with
his
usual
polite
impersonal
gaze
miss
sheridan
i
really
could
not
do
it
miss
if
it
was
a
telegram
or
something
of
that
sort
but
if
anything
was
to
happen
to
you
miss
it
would
be
it
really
would
be
most
unfortunate
norma
had
stood
still
choking
and
in
the
starlight
he
had
seen
the
glitter
of
tears
in
her
eyes
could
you
put
it
to
craigie
miss
i
sure
she
send
someone
one
of
the
maids
but
norma
shook
her
head
it
would
anger
caroline
and
perhaps
caroline
mother
and
annie
too
to
have
her
upset
the
cruise
by
her
own
foolish
plans
there
was
no
hope
of
her
hostess
consent
what
send
a
girl
of
eighteen
down
to
new
york
for
dear
knows
what
fanciful
purpose
without
a
hint
from
parent
or
guardian
craigie
knew
the
modern
girl
far
too
well
for
that
even
if
it
had
not
been
personally
extremely
inconvenient
to
herself
to
spare
a
maid
they
were
rather
short
of
maids
for
two
or
three
of
them
had
been
quite
ill
the
launch
had
put
off
with
captain
burns
in
the
stern
norma
had
stood
watching
it
with
her
heart
of
lead
oh
to
be
running
away
flying
on
the
train
in
the
familiar
streets
they
could
forgive
her
later
or
never
norma
are
you
naughty
caroline
had
interrupted
her
thoughts
and
had
slipped
a
hand
through
her
arm
buoso
is
going
to
sing
do
come
in
my
dear
you
know
that
last
hand
well
we
made
it
the
next
two
days
were
the
slowest
the
hardest
the
bitterest
of
norma
life
she
felt
that
nobody
had
ever
had
to
bear
so
aching
a
heart
as
hers
as
the
most
beautiful
yacht
in
the
world
skimmed
over
the
blue
ocean
and
the
sun
shone
down
on
her
embroidered
linen
suit
and
her
white
shoes
and
the
pearl
ring
that
caroline
had
given
her
for
her
birthday
what
were
they
doing
at
aunt
kate
what
were
they
saying
as
the
hours
went
by
at
what
stage
was
the
cake
and
the
gown
was
rose
really
to
be
married
in
new
brunswick
she
had
managed
to
send
a
long
wire
full
of
the
disappointment
and
affection
and
longing
she
truly
felt
and
after
that
she
had
been
happier
but
it
was
a
very
subdued
little
norma
who
had
come
quietly
into
aunt
kate
kitchen
three
weeks
later
and
had
relieved
her
heart
with
a
burst
of
tears
on
aunt
shoulder
aunt
kate
had
been
kind
kind
as
she
always
was
to
the
adored
and
norma
had
stayed
to
dinner
and
made
soft
and
penitent
eyes
at
wolf
until
the
agonized
resolutions
of
the
past
lonely
months
had
all
melted
out
of
his
heart
again
and
they
had
all
gone
over
to
rose
for
five
minutes
of
kissing
and
crying
before
the
big
car
came
to
carry
norma
away
so
the
worst
of
that
wound
was
healed
and
life
could
become
bright
and
promising
to
norma
once
more
autumn
was
an
invigorating
season
anyway
full
of
hope
and
enchantment
and
caroline
craigie
by
what
norma
felt
to
be
a
special
providence
was
visiting
her
grandmother
in
baltimore
for
an
indefinite
term
the
truth
was
that
there
was
a
doctor
there
whose
advice
was
deemed
valuable
to
caroline
but
norma
did
not
know
that
norma
did
not
know
the
truth
either
about
von
sudden
graciousness
toward
her
but
it
made
her
happy
annie
had
become
friendly
and
hospitable
toward
the
newcomer
in
the
family
for
only
one
reason
as
a
social
dictator
she
was
accustomed
to
be
courted
and
followed
by
scores
of
women
who
desired
her
friendship
for
the
prestige
it
gave
them
annie
was
extremely
autocratic
in
this
respect
and
could
snub
chill
and
ignore
even
the
most
hopeful
aspirants
to
her
favour
with
the
ease
of
long
practice
it
made
no
difference
to
annie
that
dazzling
credentials
were
produced
or
that
past
obscurity
was
more
than
obliterated
by
present
glory
one
truly
must
be
firm
annie
frequently
said
it
devolves
upon
a
few
of
us
as
an
actual
duty
to
see
that
society
is
maintained
in
its
true
spirit
let
the
bars
down
once
norma
a
negligible
factor
in
annie
life
when
she
first
appeared
had
quite
innocently
become
a
problem
during
that
first
summer
while
not
a
melrose
she
was
a
member
of
the
melrose
family
making
her
home
with
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
house
annie
might
ignore
norma
but
there
were
plenty
of
women
and
men
too
who
saw
in
the
girl
a
valuable
social
lever
to
become
intimate
with
little
miss
sheridan
meant
that
one
might
go
up
to
her
at
teas
and
dinners
while
she
was
with
melrose
or
young
liggett
or
even
von
behrens
herself
in
a
casual
friendly
manner
that
indicated
to
a
watching
world
a
comfortable
footing
with
the
family
norma
was
consequently
selected
for
social
attention
annie
saw
this
immediately
and
when
all
the
families
were
settled
in
town
again
she
decided
to
take
norma
social
training
in
hand
as
she
had
done
leslie
and
make
sure
that
no
undesirable
cockle
was
sown
among
the
family
fields
she
would
have
done
exactly
the
same
if
norma
had
been
the
least
attractive
of
girls
but
norma
fancied
that
her
own
qualities
had
won
annie
reluctant
friendship
and
was
accordingly
pleased
chapter
xii
eight
months
later
in
the
clear
sunshine
of
a
late
autumn
morning
a
slender
young
woman
came
down
the
steps
of
the
melrose
house
after
an
hour
call
on
the
old
mistress
and
turned
briskly
toward
fifth
avenue
in
figure
in
carriage
and
even
in
the
expression
of
her
charming
and
animated
face
she
was
different
from
the
girl
who
had
come
to
that
same
house
to
make
a
call
with
aunt
kate
on
the
day
after
the
big
blizzard
yet
it
was
the
same
norma
sheridan
who
nodded
a
refusal
to
the
driver
of
the
big
that
was
waiting
and
set
off
by
herself
for
her
walk
the
old
norma
straight
from
biretta
bookshop
had
been
pretty
in
plain
serge
and
shabby
fur
but
this
norma
over
whose
soft
thick
belted
coat
a
beautiful
skin
was
linked
whose
heavy
ribbed
silk
hose
disappeared
into
slim
flat
shining
pumps
that
almost
caressed
the
slender
foot
whose
dark
hair
had
the
lustre
that
comes
from
intelligent
care
and
whose
handsome
little
english
hat
was
the
only
one
of
its
special
cut
in
the
world
was
a
conspicuously
attractive
figure
even
in
a
world
of
girls
and
almost
deserved
to
be
catalogued
as
a
beauty
from
the
hat
to
the
shoes
she
was
palpably
correct
and
norma
knew
and
never
could
quite
sufficiently
revel
in
the
knowing
that
the
blouse
and
the
tailored
skirt
that
were
under
the
coat
were
correct
too
and
that
under
blouse
and
skirt
were
cobwebby
linens
and
perfumed
ribbons
and
sheerest
silks
that
were
equally
perfect
in
their
way
leslie
bulldog
pulling
on
his
strap
kept
her
moving
rapidly
and
girl
and
dog
exacted
from
almost
all
the
that
tribute
of
glances
to
which
norma
was
now
beginning
to
be
accustomed
she
was
walking
to
von
behrens
after
an
unusually
harmonious
luncheon
with
old
melrose
this
was
one
of
norma
happy
times
and
she
almost
danced
in
the
crisp
november
air
that
promised
snow
even
now
leslie
had
asked
her
to
come
informally
to
tea
annie
had
sent
a
message
that
she
wished
to
see
norma
and
alice
who
like
all
invalids
had
dark
moods
of
which
only
her
own
household
was
aware
had
been
her
nicest
self
for
a
week
then
christopher
was
coming
home
and
norma
had
missed
him
for
the
three
weeks
he
had
been
away
in
the
south
and
liked
the
thought
that
he
was
homeward
bound
she
found
leslie
with
annie
in
annie
big
front
bedroom
leslie
was
in
a
big
chair
by
the
bed
where
annie
with
some
chalky
preparation
pasted
in
strips
on
those
portions
of
her
face
that
were
most
inclined
to
wrinkle
was
lying
flat
her
hair
rubbed
with
oils
and
packed
in
tight
bands
was
entirely
invisible
and
over
her
arms
protruding
from
a
gorgeous
oriental
wrap
loose
chamois
gloves
were
drawn
annie
had
been
to
a
luncheon
and
was
to
appear
at
two
teas
a
dinner
and
the
theatre
and
she
was
making
the
most
of
an
interval
at
home
she
looked
indescribably
hideous
as
she
stretched
a
friendly
hand
toward
norma
and
nodded
toward
a
chair
look
at
the
child
colour
heavens
what
it
is
to
be
young
said
annie
sit
down
norma
how
alice
lovely
norma
said
pulling
off
her
gloves
she
had
a
wire
from
chris
and
he
gets
back
i
had
luncheon
with
your
mother
and
i
am
to
go
to
stay
with
her
for
two
or
three
nights
anyway
but
aunt
alice
said
that
she
would
like
to
have
me
back
again
next
week
for
her
two
teas
how
old
are
you
norma
annie
asked
suddenly
any
sign
of
interest
on
her
part
always
thrilled
the
girl
who
answered
flushing
nineteen
twenty
in
january
aunt
annie
i
thinking
if
you
like
it
of
giving
you
a
little
tea
here
next
month
annie
said
lazily
you
know
quite
enough
of
the
youngsters
now
to
have
a
thoroughly
nice
time
and
afterward
we
have
a
dinner
here
and
they
can
dance
oh
aunt
annie
if
i
like
it
norma
exclaimed
rosy
with
pleasure
you
would
annie
asked
looking
at
a
hand
from
which
she
had
drawn
the
glove
and
smiling
slightly
it
means
that
you
do
go
anywhere
in
the
meantime
you
not
out
until
then
you
know
oh
but
i
wo
be
going
anywhere
anyway
norma
conceded
contentedly
you
have
a
flood
of
invitations
fast
enough
after
the
tea
annie
assured
her
pleased
at
her
excitement
and
until
then
you
can
simply
say
that
you
are
not
going
out
yet
chris
said
he
might
take
me
to
the
opera
on
the
first
night
i
never
been
norma
said
timidly
but
i
can
explain
to
him
oh
that
wo
count
annie
assured
her
carelessly
we
all
be
there
of
course
have
you
worn
the
gown
yet
oh
no
aunt
annie
well
keep
it
for
that
night
and
you
and
chris
might
no
he
want
to
dine
with
alice
and
she
want
to
see
you
in
your
new
gown
i
was
going
to
say
that
you
might
dine
here
but
you
better
not
i
think
leslie
and
acton
are
going
to
be
asked
to
dine
with
us
norma
said
aunt
alice
said
something
about
it
well
annie
agreed
indifferently
ring
that
bell
norma
i
got
to
get
up
where
are
you
girls
going
now
some
of
the
girls
are
coming
to
my
house
for
tea
leslie
answered
listlessly
i
got
the
car
here
come
on
norma
but
you
not
driving
kiddie
her
aunt
asked
quickly
leslie
who
neither
looked
nor
felt
well
raised
eyes
oh
no
i
not
driving
and
i
lying
in
bed
mornings
and
i
play
squash
or
ride
horseback
or
go
in
for
tennis
she
drawled
half
angrily
i
having
a
perfectly
time
i
wish
acton
had
a
little
of
it
he
would
be
so
pleased
makes
me
so
mad
grumbled
leslie
as
she
wandered
toward
the
door
busily
buttoning
her
coat
grandma
crying
with
joy
and
aunt
alice
at
me
and
acton
come
now
be
a
little
sport
leslie
her
aunt
urged
affectionately
with
her
arm
about
her
it
rotten
of
course
but
after
all
it
does
mean
a
lot
to
the
liggetts
oh
now
do
begin
leslie
protested
with
her
parting
nod
do
for
pity
sake
talk
about
it
she
added
rudely
to
norma
as
norma
began
some
consolatory
murmur
on
the
stairs
but
when
they
were
before
her
own
fire
waiting
for
the
expected
girls
she
made
norma
a
rather
ungracious
confidence
i
do
want
aunt
alice
or
any
one
to
know
it
but
if
acton
liggett
thinks
i
am
going
to
let
him
make
an
absolute
fool
of
me
mistaken
leslie
said
in
a
sort
of
smouldering
resentment
what
has
acton
done
norma
asked
flattered
by
the
intimation
of
trust
and
not
inclined
to
be
apprehensive
she
had
seen
earlier
differences
between
the
young
married
pair
and
now
when
leslie
was
physically
at
a
disadvantage
she
and
alice
had
agreed
that
it
was
not
unnatural
that
the
young
wife
should
grow
exacting
and
fanciful
acton
is
about
the
most
selfish
person
i
ever
knew
leslie
said
almost
with
a
whimper
oh
yes
he
is
norma
you
do
see
it
but
i
do
chris
knows
it
too
i
heard
chris
call
him
down
a
thousand
times
for
it
i
am
just
boiling
at
acton
i
have
been
all
day
he
leaves
everything
to
me
everything
and
i
not
well
now
and
i
ca
stand
it
and
i
tell
him
i
ca
too
i
suppose
a
man
does
understand
very
well
norma
ventured
does
leslie
said
warmly
all
acton
liggett
thinks
of
is
his
own
comfort
that
all
i
do
everything
for
him
i
pay
half
the
expenses
here
you
know
more
than
half
really
for
i
always
pay
for
my
own
clothes
and
milly
and
lots
of
other
things
and
then
he
do
some
ugly
thing
that
just
makes
me
furious
at
him
and
he
walk
out
of
the
house
perfectly
calm
and
happy
he
always
had
his
own
way
a
good
deal
norma
who
knew
anything
except
sympathy
would
utterly
exasperate
leslie
conceded
mildly
yes
leslie
agreed
flushing
and
stiffening
her
jaw
rather
ominously
and
it
just
about
time
that
he
learned
that
he
is
always
going
to
have
it
too
it
very
easy
for
him
to
have
me
do
anything
that
is
hard
and
stupid
do
you
suppose
she
broke
off
suddenly
that
so
anxious
to
go
to
the
duers
dinner
i
would
care
if
i
never
saw
one
of
them
again
norma
gathered
that
a
dinner
invitation
from
the
duers
had
been
the
main
cause
of
the
young
liggetts
difference
and
framed
a
general
question
that
saturday
night
friday
leslie
amended
and
what
does
he
do
he
meets
roy
duer
at
the
club
and
says
oh
no
he
ca
come
to
the
dinner
friday
but
can
he
has
promised
to
play
bridge
with
the
jeromes
and
that
crowd
but
leslie
would
to
go
so
there
i
am
old
lady
duer
called
me
up
the
next
morning
and
was
so
sorry
acton
could
come
but
she
would
expect
me
at
eight
it
for
her
daughter
and
she
goes
away
again
on
tuesday
and
then
leslie
straightened
herself
on
the
couch
and
fixed
norma
with
bright
angry
eyes
then
spooky
jerome
telephoned
here
and
said
to
tell
acton
that
if
he
could
stir
up
a
bridge
party
for
friday
he
stir
up
something
and
for
acton
to
meet
him
at
the
club
norma
laughed
and
did
you
give
acton
that
message
she
inquired
no
indeed
i
did
that
was
only
this
morning
leslie
said
in
angry
satisfaction
i
telephoned
duer
right
away
and
said
that
acton
would
be
so
glad
to
come
friday
and
if
acton
liggett
does
like
it
he
knows
what
he
can
do
you
laugh
she
went
on
with
a
sort
of
pathetic
dignity
but
do
you
think
it
a
rotten
way
for
a
man
to
treat
his
wife
norma
do
you
honestly
there
nothing
nothing
that
i
do
give
way
in
absolutely
nothing
and
i
do
believe
most
men
oh
hello
doris
leslie
broke
off
gaily
as
there
was
a
stir
at
the
door
come
in
come
in
vera
are
you
girls
angels
to
come
in
and
see
the
poor
old
sick
lady
norma
was
still
lingering
when
acton
came
home
an
hour
later
she
heard
his
buoyant
voice
in
the
hall
and
began
to
gather
her
wraps
and
gloves
as
he
came
to
the
tea
table
acton
leslie
said
firmly
the
bridge
party
is
off
for
friday
and
you
going
to
duer
with
me
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
whew
i
can
see
that
i
popular
in
the
home
circle
norma
acton
said
leaning
over
the
big
davenport
to
kiss
his
wife
how
my
baby
all
right
dear
anything
you
say
goes
i
was
going
to
cancel
the
game
anyway
look
what
chris
brought
you
say
norma
has
she
been
getting
herself
tired
leslie
instantly
mollified
drew
his
cold
firm
cheek
against
hers
and
looked
sidewise
toward
norma
is
he
the
nice
big
comfy
man
to
come
home
to
his
mad
little
old
wife
she
mumbled
luxuriously
yes
acton
grumbled
still
half
embracing
her
but
you
did
talk
that
way
at
breakfast
you
little
devil
am
i
a
devil
leslie
asked
lazily
and
looking
in
whimsical
penitence
at
norma
she
added
i
a
devil
but
you
were
just
as
mean
as
you
could
be
she
told
him
widening
her
eyes
and
shaking
her
head
i
know
it
i
felt
like
a
dog
walking
down
town
her
husband
admitted
promptly
i
tried
to
telephone
but
you
were
here
i
was
at
aunt
annie
leslie
said
softly
her
husband
had
slipped
in
beside
her
on
the
wide
davenport
and
she
was
resting
against
his
shoulder
and
idly
kissing
the
little
rebel
lock
of
hair
that
fell
across
one
temple
he
a
pretty
nice
old
husband
she
murmured
contentedly
and
she
a
pretty
nice
little
wife
if
she
did
call
me
some
mean
names
acton
returned
kissing
the
top
of
her
head
without
altering
her
position
norma
looked
at
them
with
smiling
contempt
you
a
great
pair
she
conceded
indulgently
leslie
now
was
free
to
examine
with
a
flush
and
a
laugh
the
microscopic
pair
of
beaded
indian
moccasins
that
chris
had
brought
from
florida
norma
asked
about
chris
oh
he
fine
acton
answered
looks
brown
and
hard
he
had
a
gorgeous
time
he
said
he
might
be
round
to
see
grandma
morning
i
tell
her
norma
said
getting
up
to
go
she
left
them
still
clinging
together
like
a
pair
of
little
with
peace
fully
restored
for
the
time
being
melrose
car
had
been
waiting
for
some
time
and
she
was
whirled
home
through
the
dark
and
wintry
streets
without
the
loss
of
a
second
lights
were
lighted
everywhere
now
and
tempered
radiance
filled
the
old
hall
as
she
entered
it
it
was
just
six
but
norma
knew
that
she
and
the
old
lady
were
to
be
alone
and
she
went
through
the
long
to
the
library
beyond
it
thinking
she
might
find
her
still
lingering
over
the
teacups
dinner
under
these
circumstances
was
usually
at
seven
and
frequently
melrose
did
not
change
her
gown
for
it
there
was
lamplight
in
the
library
but
the
old
lady
chair
was
empty
and
the
tea
table
had
been
cleared
away
norma
supposing
the
room
unoccupied
gave
a
little
gasp
of
surprise
and
pleasure
as
chris
suddenly
got
to
his
feet
among
the
shadows
she
was
so
glad
to
see
him
so
much
more
glad
than
she
would
have
imagined
herself
that
for
a
few
minutes
she
merely
clung
tight
to
the
two
hands
she
had
grasped
and
stood
laughing
and
staring
at
him
chris
back
again
it
meant
so
much
that
was
pleasant
and
friendly
to
norma
chris
advised
her
admired
her
sympathized
with
her
above
all
she
knew
that
he
liked
her
chris
it
so
nice
to
see
you
she
exclaimed
the
colour
came
into
his
face
and
with
it
an
odd
expression
that
she
had
never
seen
there
before
without
speaking
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
very
quietly
on
the
mouth
hello
you
dear
little
girl
he
said
freeing
her
and
smiling
at
her
somewhat
confusedly
you
not
half
so
glad
to
see
me
as
i
am
to
be
back
you
looking
so
well
norma
he
went
on
with
almost
his
usual
manner
and
alice
tells
me
you
are
making
friends
everywhere
the
news
he
threw
himself
into
a
large
leather
chair
and
hardly
knowing
what
she
was
doing
in
the
wild
hurrying
of
her
senses
norma
sat
down
opposite
him
her
one
flurried
impulse
was
not
to
make
a
scene
chris
was
always
so
entirely
master
of
a
situation
so
utterly
unemotional
and
that
if
he
kissed
her
upon
his
return
from
a
absence
it
must
be
a
perfectly
correct
thing
to
do
yet
she
felt
both
shaken
and
protestant
and
it
was
with
almost
superhuman
control
that
she
began
to
carry
on
a
casual
conversation
giving
her
own
report
upon
alice
and
leslie
acton
and
the
world
in
general
when
melrose
delighted
at
the
little
attention
from
her
came
smilingly
in
five
minutes
later
norma
escaped
upstairs
she
had
leslie
old
room
here
when
she
spent
the
night
but
it
was
only
occasionally
that
alice
spared
her
for
her
youth
and
high
spirits
coupled
with
the
simplicity
and
enthusiasm
with
which
she
was
encountering
the
new
world
made
her
a
really
stimulating
companion
for
the
sick
woman
regina
came
in
to
hook
her
into
a
simple
dinner
gown
but
norma
did
not
once
address
her
except
by
a
vague
smile
of
greeting
her
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
why
had
he
done
that
was
it
just
brotherly
friendliness
he
was
much
older
than
she
or
eight
perhaps
he
had
felt
only
an
older
man
kindly
but
her
face
blazed
and
she
flung
this
explanation
aside
angrily
he
had
no
business
to
do
it
he
had
no
right
to
do
it
she
was
furious
at
him
she
stood
still
staring
blankly
ahead
of
her
in
the
centre
of
the
room
the
memory
came
over
her
in
a
wave
the
odd
look
in
his
eyes
as
his
arms
enveloped
her
the
faint
aroma
of
talcum
powder
and
soap
the
touch
of
his
smoothly
shaven
cheek
it
was
almost
an
hour
later
that
she
went
cautiously
downstairs
he
was
gone
had
been
gone
since
six
joseph
reported
norma
went
in
to
dinner
with
melrose
and
they
talked
cheerfully
of
chris
return
of
leslie
and
annie
by
eight
reading
in
melrose
upstairs
that
first
room
that
she
had
seen
in
this
big
house
eight
months
ago
norma
began
to
feel
just
a
trifle
flat
chris
liggett
was
one
of
the
most
popular
men
in
society
in
demand
everywhere
spoiled
by
women
everywhere
he
had
quite
casually
and
perhaps
even
kissed
his
wife
young
protégée
upon
meeting
her
after
an
absence
and
she
had
hastily
leaped
to
conclusions
worthy
of
a
schoolgirl
he
would
be
about
equally
amused
and
disgusted
did
he
suspect
them
he
likes
you
you
little
fool
norma
said
to
herself
and
you
will
utterly
spoil
everything
with
your
idiocy
what
did
you
say
lovey
the
old
lady
asked
half
closing
her
book
nothing
norma
said
laughing
she
reopened
her
novel
and
tried
to
interest
herself
in
it
but
the
thought
of
that
quarter
hour
in
the
study
came
back
over
and
over
again
she
came
finally
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
glad
chris
liked
her
the
room
was
very
still
a
coal
fire
was
glowing
pink
and
clear
in
the
grate
and
now
and
then
the
radiators
hissed
softly
norma
had
one
big
brilliant
lamp
to
herself
and
over
the
old
lady
chair
another
glowed
everything
was
rich
soft
comfortable
regina
was
hovering
in
the
adjoining
room
folding
the
fat
satin
comforters
turning
down
the
transparent
linen
sheets
with
their
great
scroll
of
monogram
and
behind
regina
were
joseph
and
emma
and
all
the
others
and
behind
them
the
great
city
and
all
the
world
eager
to
see
that
this
old
woman
who
had
given
the
world
very
little
real
service
in
her
life
should
be
shielded
and
warmed
and
kept
from
the
faintest
dream
of
need
money
was
a
strange
thing
norma
mused
what
should
she
do
if
as
her
shamed
and
vague
phrase
had
it
if
something
happened
to
aunt
marianna
and
she
was
not
even
mentioned
in
her
will
of
course
it
was
a
hateful
thing
to
think
of
and
a
horrible
thing
sitting
here
opposite
aunt
marianna
in
the
comfortable
upstairs
but
the
thought
would
come
norma
wished
that
she
knew
she
would
not
have
shortened
the
old
lady
life
by
a
single
second
and
she
would
have
died
herself
rather
than
betray
this
thought
to
any
one
even
to
wolf
even
to
rose
but
it
suddenly
seemed
to
her
very
unjust
that
she
could
be
picked
out
of
biretta
bookstore
by
aunt
marianna
pleasure
and
perhaps
put
back
there
through
no
fault
of
her
own
they
were
all
kind
they
were
all
generous
but
this
was
not
just
she
wanted
the
delicious
and
feeling
of
being
a
young
woman
with
independent
means
such
evenings
as
this
one
even
in
the
wonderful
melrose
house
were
undeniably
dull
she
and
rose
had
often
grumbled
years
ago
because
there
were
so
many
of
these
quiet
times
in
between
the
saturday
and
sunday
excitements
but
norma
in
those
days
had
never
supposed
that
dulness
was
ever
compatible
with
wealth
and
ease
cards
said
old
melrose
hopefully
as
the
girl
made
a
sudden
move
she
loved
to
play
patience
but
only
when
she
had
an
audience
norma
who
had
just
decided
to
give
her
french
verbs
a
good
attention
smiled
amiably
and
herself
brought
out
the
green
table
she
sat
watching
the
fall
of
kings
and
aces
reminding
her
companion
of
at
least
every
third
play
but
her
thoughts
went
back
to
chris
and
the
faint
odour
of
powder
and
soap
and
the
touch
of
his
shaved
cheek
chapter
xiii
norma
met
chris
again
no
later
than
the
following
afternoon
it
was
twilight
in
alice
room
and
she
and
norma
were
talking
on
into
the
gloom
discussing
the
one
or
two
guests
who
had
chanced
to
come
in
for
tea
and
planning
the
two
large
teas
that
alice
usually
gave
some
time
late
in
november
chris
came
in
quietly
kissed
his
wife
and
nodded
carelessly
to
norma
the
girl
sudden
mad
heartbeats
and
creeping
colour
could
subside
together
unnoticed
for
he
apparently
paid
no
attention
to
her
and
presently
drifted
to
the
piano
leaving
the
women
free
to
resume
their
conference
alice
was
a
person
of
more
than
a
surface
sweetness
she
loved
harmony
and
serenity
and
there
was
almost
no
inclination
to
irritability
or
ugliness
in
her
nature
her
voice
was
always
soothing
and
soft
and
her
patience
in
the
unravelling
of
other
people
problems
was
inexhaustible
alice
was
as
all
the
world
conceded
an
angel
but
norma
had
not
been
a
member
of
her
household
for
eight
months
without
realizing
that
alice
like
other
household
angels
did
not
wish
an
understudy
in
the
rôle
she
did
not
quite
enjoy
the
nearness
of
another
woman
who
might
be
all
sweet
and
generous
and
too
that
was
her
own
sacred
and
peculiar
right
she
could
gently
and
persistently
urge
objections
and
find
inconsistencies
in
any
plan
of
her
sister
or
of
norma
no
matter
how
advantageous
it
sounded
and
she
could
adhere
to
a
plan
of
her
own
with
a
tenacity
that
taken
in
consideration
with
alice
weak
body
and
tender
voice
was
nothing
less
than
astonishing
norma
lessoned
in
a
hard
school
and
possessing
more
than
her
share
of
adaptability
and
common
sense
had
swiftly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
since
it
was
not
her
part
to
adjust
the
affairs
of
her
benefactors
she
might
much
more
wisely
constitute
herself
a
sort
of
greek
chorus
to
alice
manipulations
alice
motives
were
always
of
the
highest
and
it
was
easy
to
praise
them
in
all
honesty
and
if
sometimes
the
younger
woman
had
mentally
arrived
at
a
conclusion
long
before
alice
had
patiently
and
sweetly
reached
it
the
little
was
not
much
to
pay
toward
the
comfort
of
a
woman
as
heavily
afflicted
as
alice
for
norma
knew
in
her
own
heart
that
alice
was
heavily
afflicted
although
the
invalid
herself
always
took
the
attitude
that
her
helplessness
brought
the
best
part
of
life
into
her
room
and
shut
away
from
her
the
tediousness
and
ugliness
of
the
world
two
weeks
from
alice
said
this
evening
with
her
sympathetic
smile
oh
aunt
alice
if
you
could
go
did
you
love
it
love
the
opera
do
you
hear
her
chris
but
i
did
love
people
talking
all
about
me
and
they
will
do
it
you
know
and
that
makes
one
furious
i
see
you
getting
furious
norma
observed
incredulously
you
do
know
me
but
i
was
a
bashful
adoring
sort
of
little
person
on
my
first
night
yes
you
were
chris
teased
her
over
a
lazy
ripple
of
thirds
she
was
such
a
bashful
little
person
at
the
mardi
gras
dance
she
promised
artie
peyton
her
first
cotillion
the
following
season
oh
aunt
alice
you
did
alice
rather
colourless
face
flushed
happily
and
she
half
lowered
her
lids
chris
thinks
that
is
a
great
story
on
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
do
that
i
was
just
childish
enough
but
i
ca
think
how
the
story
got
out
for
i
was
desperately
ashamed
of
it
i
told
aunt
annie
and
leslie
that
you
wanted
the
liggetts
to
dine
here
that
night
norma
said
suddenly
instantly
she
realized
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
whose
light
reproof
hurt
her
as
alice
did
you
you
gave
my
invitation
to
leslie
alice
asked
quietly
well
not
quite
that
but
i
told
her
that
you
had
said
that
you
meant
to
ask
them
norma
replied
uncomfortably
but
norma
i
did
not
ask
you
to
mention
it
alice
was
even
smiling
but
she
seemed
a
little
puzzled
i
so
sorry
if
you
did
want
me
to
it
is
that
but
one
feels
that
one
what
is
norma
sorry
about
chris
asked
coming
back
to
the
fire
norma
you
up
against
a
terrible
tribunal
here
alice
has
been
known
well
even
to
give
new
hats
to
the
people
who
make
her
angry
this
fortunate
allusion
to
an
event
now
some
months
old
entirely
restored
alice
good
humour
norma
had
accepted
a
certain
hat
from
leslie
just
before
the
wedding
and
alice
burning
with
her
secret
suspicion
as
to
norma
parentage
and
in
the
first
flush
of
her
affection
for
the
girl
had
told
norma
that
in
her
opinion
leslie
should
not
have
offered
it
it
was
not
for
norma
to
take
any
patronage
from
her
cousin
alice
said
to
herself
but
norma
distress
at
having
disappointed
alice
was
so
fresh
and
honest
that
the
episode
had
ended
with
alice
presenting
her
with
a
stunning
new
hat
to
wipe
out
the
terrible
effect
of
her
mild
criticism
you
a
virago
said
chris
seating
himself
near
his
wife
tell
me
what
you
been
doing
all
day
am
i
in
for
that
dinner
at
i
wish
i
could
stay
here
and
gossip
with
you
girls
dearest
you
get
so
stupid
tied
here
to
me
that
you
would
know
who
was
president
of
the
united
states
alice
smiled
yes
i
promised
you
to
annie
two
weeks
ago
night
norma
goes
to
leslie
and
you
and
i
have
dinner
all
alone
so
console
yourself
with
that
christopher
agreed
and
as
if
the
phrase
suggested
it
he
went
on
to
test
norma
french
norma
was
never
with
him
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
and
alice
were
laughing
at
her
earnest
absurdities
when
husband
and
wife
went
on
into
a
conversation
of
their
own
norma
sat
back
idly
conscious
that
the
atmosphere
was
always
easy
and
pleasant
when
chris
was
at
home
there
were
no
petty
tensions
and
no
sensitive
misconstructions
while
chris
was
talking
sometimes
with
annie
and
alice
and
even
with
leslie
norma
could
be
rapidly
brought
to
the
state
of
feeling
prickly
all
over
afraid
to
speak
and
equally
uncomfortable
in
silence
but
chris
always
smoothed
her
spirit
into
utter
peace
and
reëstablished
her
sense
of
proportion
her
sense
of
humour
neither
he
nor
alice
noticed
her
when
she
presently
went
away
to
change
her
gown
for
dinner
but
when
she
came
out
of
her
room
half
an
hour
later
chris
was
just
coming
up
to
his
their
rooms
were
on
the
same
floor
his
the
big
front
room
and
hers
one
of
the
sunny
small
ones
at
the
back
of
the
house
norma
and
that
of
miss
slater
alice
nurse
were
joined
by
a
bathroom
chris
had
his
own
splendid
and
bath
fitted
like
his
bedroom
with
rugs
and
chests
and
highboys
worthy
of
a
museum
are
you
going
to
be
late
chris
norma
asked
when
they
met
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
fresh
from
a
bath
with
her
rich
dark
hair
pushed
back
in
two
shining
wings
from
her
smooth
forehead
and
her
throat
rising
white
and
soft
from
the
frills
of
a
black
lacy
gown
she
was
the
incarnation
of
youth
and
sweetness
as
she
looked
up
at
him
seven
she
reminded
him
for
answer
he
surprised
her
by
catching
her
hand
and
staring
gravely
down
at
her
were
you
angry
at
me
norma
he
asked
in
a
quiet
businesslike
voice
angry
she
echoed
surprised
but
her
colour
rose
no
chris
why
should
i
be
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
be
of
course
he
answered
simply
almost
indifferently
and
immediately
he
went
by
her
and
into
his
room
chapter
xiv
on
the
memorable
night
of
her
first
grand
opera
norma
and
chris
dined
at
von
behrens
it
was
alice
who
urged
the
arrangement
urged
it
quite
innocently
as
she
frequently
did
the
accidental
pairing
of
norma
and
chris
because
her
mother
was
going
for
a
week
to
boston
the
following
day
and
they
wanted
an
evening
of
comfortable
talk
together
norma
with
freda
and
miss
slater
as
excited
accomplices
laid
out
the
new
gown
at
about
five
in
the
afternoon
laid
beside
it
the
stockings
and
slippers
that
exactly
matched
it
in
colour
and
hung
over
the
foot
of
her
bed
the
embroidered
little
stays
that
were
so
ridiculously
small
and
so
unnecessarily
beautiful
on
a
separate
chair
was
spread
the
big
furred
wrap
of
gold
and
brown
brocade
the
high
carriage
shoes
and
the
long
white
gloves
to
which
the
tissue
paper
still
was
clinging
the
orchids
that
annie
had
given
norma
that
morning
were
standing
in
a
slender
vase
on
the
bureau
and
as
a
final
touch
the
girl
regarding
these
preparations
with
a
sort
of
enchanted
delight
unfurled
to
its
full
glory
the
great
black
fan
norma
amused
alice
and
melrose
by
refusing
tea
and
disappeared
long
before
there
was
need
to
begin
the
great
ceremony
of
robing
miss
slater
manicured
her
hands
while
freda
brushed
and
dressed
the
dark
thick
hair
between
norma
and
the
nurse
there
had
at
first
been
no
special
liking
both
were
naturally
candidates
for
alice
favour
but
as
the
months
went
by
and
norma
began
to
realize
that
miss
position
was
not
only
far
from
the
ideally
beautiful
one
it
had
seemed
at
first
but
that
the
homely
elderly
woman
was
actually
putting
herself
to
some
pains
to
make
norma
own
life
in
the
liggett
house
more
comfortable
than
it
might
have
been
she
had
come
genuinely
to
admire
alice
attendant
and
now
they
were
fast
friends
it
was
often
in
norma
power
to
distract
alice
attention
from
the
fact
that
miss
slater
was
a
little
late
in
returning
from
her
walk
or
she
would
make
it
a
point
to
order
for
the
invalid
something
that
miss
slater
had
forgotten
they
stood
firmly
together
in
many
a
small
domestic
emergency
and
although
the
nurse
presence
was
not
as
norma
thought
with
a
little
pang
like
having
rose
or
aunt
kate
with
her
still
it
was
much
much
better
than
having
no
one
at
all
she
sat
wrapped
luxuriously
in
a
brilliant
kimono
while
freda
brushed
and
rolled
busily
and
miss
slater
polished
and
clipped
then
ensued
a
period
of
intense
concentration
at
the
mirror
when
the
sparkling
pins
were
put
in
her
hair
and
the
little
pearl
earrings
screwed
into
her
ears
and
when
much
rubbing
and
greasing
and
powdering
went
on
and
even
some
slight
retouching
of
the
innocent
red
young
mouth
shall
i
norma
asked
dubiously
eyeing
the
effect
of
a
trace
of
rouge
do
be
an
idiot
miss
sheridan
miss
slater
said
you
got
a
lovely
colour
and
it
a
shame
to
touch
it
oh
but
i
think
i
look
so
pale
norma
argued
well
when
you
had
your
dinner
now
you
take
my
advice
my
dear
and
let
your
face
alone
well
all
the
girls
do
it
norma
declared
catching
up
the
little
girdle
and
not
unwilling
to
be
she
gave
an
actual
shiver
of
delight
as
freda
slipped
the
gown
over
her
head
it
fell
into
shape
about
her
a
miracle
of
cut
and
fit
the
little
satiny
underskirt
was
heavy
with
beads
the
misty
cloud
of
gauze
that
floated
above
it
was
hardly
heavy
enough
to
hold
its
own
embroideries
little
beaded
straps
held
it
to
the
flawless
shoulders
and
norma
made
her
two
attendants
laugh
as
she
jerked
and
fussed
at
the
gold
lace
and
tiny
satin
roses
that
crossed
her
breast
leave
it
alone
miss
slater
said
oh
but
it
seems
so
low
well
you
may
be
very
sure
it
is
lenz
knows
what
he
doing
when
he
makes
a
gown
here
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
flowers
oh
i
going
to
wrap
the
paper
round
them
and
carry
them
until
just
before
i
get
to
aunt
annie
would
you
would
i
i
like
that
said
miss
slater
settling
her
eyeglasses
on
the
bridge
of
her
nose
with
a
finger
and
thumb
norma
had
a
momentary
pang
of
sympathy
she
could
never
have
been
made
to
understand
that
a
happy
barnyard
duck
may
look
contentedly
up
from
her
pool
at
the
peacock
trailing
his
plumes
on
the
wall
norma
for
the
love
of
allah
chris
shouted
from
downstairs
norma
gave
a
panicky
laugh
snatched
her
fan
wrap
and
flowers
and
fled
joyously
down
to
be
criticized
and
praised
on
the
whole
they
were
pleased
with
her
alice
seizing
a
chance
for
an
aside
to
tell
her
not
to
worry
about
the
lowness
of
the
gown
that
it
was
absolutely
correct
she
might
be
very
sure
and
melrose
quite
tremulously
delighted
with
her
ward
chris
did
not
say
much
until
a
few
minutes
before
they
planned
to
start
when
he
slipped
a
thin
flat
gold
watch
from
his
vest
pocket
and
asked
speculatively
norma
has
your
aunt
kate
ever
seen
you
in
that
rig
no
she
answered
quickly
and
then
with
less
sparkle
no
well
would
you
like
to
run
in
on
her
a
moment
she
probably
like
it
tremendously
said
chris
oh
chris
i
would
love
it
norma
exclaimed
soberly
over
a
disloyal
conviction
that
she
would
rather
not
but
have
we
time
tons
of
time
annie
dinners
are
a
joke
norma
glanced
at
the
women
melrose
looked
undecided
but
alice
said
encouragingly
i
think
that
would
be
a
sweet
thing
to
do
so
it
was
decided
and
norma
was
bundled
up
immediately
and
called
out
excitedly
laughing
as
chris
hurried
her
to
the
car
you
know
it
means
a
lot
to
your
own
people
really
to
see
you
this
way
instead
of
always
reading
about
it
or
hearing
about
it
chris
said
in
his
entirely
prosaic
tone
as
the
car
glided
smoothly
toward
the
west
sixties
i
know
it
norma
agreed
but
i
do
know
how
you
do
she
added
in
shy
gratitude
well
i
nearly
twice
your
age
for
one
thing
he
replied
pleasantly
and
as
the
car
stopped
unhesitatingly
at
the
familiar
door
he
added
now
make
this
very
snappy
she
protested
against
his
getting
out
but
he
accompanied
her
all
the
way
upstairs
both
laughing
like
conspirators
as
they
passed
somewhat
astonished
residents
of
the
apartment
house
on
the
way
aunt
kate
and
wolf
and
rose
and
harry
as
good
fortune
would
have
it
were
all
gathered
under
the
lamp
and
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
and
welcome
for
norma
and
mister
chris
norma
wrap
was
tossed
aside
and
she
revolved
in
all
her
glory
waving
her
fan
at
length
pleasantly
conscious
of
wolf
utter
stupefaction
and
conscious
too
a
little
less
pleasantly
that
aunt
kate
maternal
eye
did
not
agree
with
aunt
annie
in
the
matter
of
then
she
and
chris
were
on
their
way
again
and
the
legitimate
delights
of
being
young
and
correctly
dressed
and
dining
with
the
great
von
behrens
and
going
to
grand
opera
at
the
metropolitan
might
begin
norma
had
perhaps
never
in
her
life
been
in
such
wild
spirits
as
she
was
it
was
not
happiness
exactly
not
the
happiness
of
a
serene
spirit
and
a
quiet
mind
for
she
was
too
nervous
and
too
much
excited
to
be
really
happy
but
it
was
all
wonderful
she
was
the
youngest
person
at
the
long
dinner
table
at
which
eighteen
guests
sat
in
such
stately
and
such
separated
great
carved
chairs
as
almost
to
dine
alone
everyone
was
charmingly
kind
to
the
little
melrose
protégée
who
was
to
be
introduced
at
a
formal
tea
next
week
the
men
were
all
older
than
leslie
group
and
were
neither
afraid
nor
too
selfishly
wrapped
up
in
their
own
narrow
little
circle
to
be
polite
norma
had
known
grown
young
men
college
graduates
and
the
sons
of
prominent
families
who
were
too
entirely
conventional
to
be
addressed
without
an
introduction
or
to
turn
to
a
strange
girl
rescue
if
she
spilled
a
cup
of
tea
but
there
was
none
of
that
sort
of
thing
here
to
be
sure
annie
men
were
either
married
divorced
or
too
old
to
be
strictly
eligible
in
the
eyes
of
unsophisticated
nineteen
but
that
did
not
keep
them
from
serving
delightfully
as
dinner
partners
then
aunt
annie
herself
was
delightful
and
joined
in
the
general
if
unexpressed
flattery
that
norma
felt
in
the
actual
atmosphere
heavens
do
you
hear
that
ella
said
annie
to
an
intimate
and
contemporary
when
norma
shyly
asked
if
the
dress
was
all
as
it
should
be
if
the
well
the
neck
was
just
a
little
heavens
said
von
behrens
roundly
if
i
had
your
shoulders
if
i
were
nineteen
again
you
see
something
a
good
deal
more
sensational
than
that
this
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
one
repeated
to
aunt
kate
it
was
like
much
of
annie
conversation
so
daring
as
to
be
a
little
shocking
but
annie
had
so
much
manner
such
a
pleasant
assured
voice
that
somehow
norma
never
found
it
censurable
in
her
for
the
first
time
hendrick
von
behrens
paid
her
a
little
personal
attention
norma
had
always
liked
the
big
blond
silent
man
with
his
thinning
fair
hair
and
his
affection
for
his
sons
it
was
of
his
sons
that
he
spoke
to
her
as
he
came
up
to
her
there
are
two
little
boys
up
in
the
nursery
that
do
want
to
go
to
sleep
until
cousin
norma
comes
up
to
say
said
hendrick
smiling
indulgently
norma
turned
willingly
from
chris
and
two
or
three
other
men
and
women
it
was
a
privilege
to
be
sufficiently
at
home
in
this
magnificent
place
to
follow
her
host
up
to
the
nursery
upstairs
and
be
gingerly
hugged
by
the
little
boys
chris
watched
her
go
the
big
fan
and
the
blue
eye
and
the
delightful
low
voice
all
busy
as
she
and
hendrick
went
away
and
an
odd
thought
came
to
him
that
was
her
stepfather
upon
whom
she
was
turning
the
battery
of
those
lovely
eyes
those
little
boys
who
were
he
knew
jumping
up
and
down
in
their
little
dutch
colonial
beds
and
calling
norma
norma
norma
were
her
he
glanced
toward
annie
her
beautiful
figure
wrapped
in
a
sparkling
robe
that
swept
about
her
like
a
regal
mantle
her
fair
hair
scalloped
like
waves
of
carved
gold
her
fingers
and
throat
and
hair
and
ears
sparkling
with
diamonds
annie
had
on
the
famous
murison
pearls
too
she
was
twisting
them
in
her
fingers
as
her
creditable
italian
delighted
the
ears
of
the
italian
ambassador
her
own
daughter
sat
among
her
guests
chris
liked
to
think
himself
above
surprise
but
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
was
never
absent
a
second
from
his
thoughts
he
drifted
toward
his
hostess
he
was
proud
of
his
own
languages
and
when
norma
came
back
she
came
to
stand
wistfully
beside
them
wondering
if
ever
ever
ever
she
would
be
able
to
do
that
it
was
all
thrilling
exhilarating
wonderful
norma
heart
thumped
delightfully
as
the
big
turned
into
broadway
and
took
their
place
in
the
slowly
moving
line
she
pressed
her
radiant
face
close
to
the
window
snow
was
fluttering
softly
down
in
the
darkness
and
men
were
pushing
it
from
the
sidewalks
and
shouting
in
the
night
there
was
the
usual
fringe
of
onlookers
in
front
of
the
opera
house
and
it
required
all
norma
to
seem
quite
naturally
absorbed
in
getting
herself
safely
out
of
the
and
quite
unconscious
that
her
pretty
ankles
and
her
pretty
head
and
the
great
bunched
wrap
were
not
being
generally
appraised
women
were
stepping
about
gingerly
in
high
heels
lights
flashed
on
quivering
aigrettes
on
the
pressed
intense
faces
of
the
watchers
and
on
the
gently
turning
and
falling
snow
against
the
dark
street
norma
was
caught
in
some
man
protecting
arm
to
push
through
into
the
churning
crowd
in
the
foyer
she
had
a
glimpse
of
uniformed
ushers
and
programme
boys
of
furred
shoulders
of
bared
shoulders
of
silk
hats
of
a
sign
that
said
footmen
are
not
allowed
in
this
lobby
then
somehow
through
currents
in
the
crowd
they
reached
the
mysterious
door
of
the
box
and
norma
saw
for
the
first
time
the
great
dimly
lighted
circle
of
the
opera
house
the
enormous
rise
of
balcony
above
balcony
the
double
tiers
of
boxes
and
the
rows
of
seats
downstairs
separated
by
wide
aisles
and
rapidly
filling
now
with
the
men
and
women
who
were
coming
down
to
their
places
almost
on
a
run
the
orchestra
was
already
seated
and
as
norma
stood
awed
and
ecstatic
in
the
front
of
the
von
behrens
box
the
conductor
came
in
and
was
met
with
a
wave
of
applause
which
had
no
sooner
died
away
than
the
lights
fanned
softly
and
quickly
down
there
was
the
click
of
a
baton
on
wood
and
in
the
instantly
ensuing
hush
the
first
quivering
notes
of
the
opera
began
sit
down
you
acton
liggett
whispered
laughing
and
norma
sank
stiffly
upon
her
chair
risking
as
the
curtain
had
not
yet
risen
a
swift
bewildered
smile
of
apology
toward
the
dim
forms
that
were
rustling
and
settling
behind
her
oo
oo
ooo
was
all
that
she
could
whisper
when
presently
chris
murmured
a
question
in
her
ear
and
when
the
lights
were
on
again
and
the
stars
taking
their
calls
he
saw
that
her
face
was
wet
and
her
lashes
were
caught
together
with
tears
it
wonderful
music
the
best
of
verdi
he
said
to
annie
and
annie
agreeing
sent
him
off
with
that
baby
to
have
her
dry
her
eyes
norma
liked
his
not
speaking
to
her
on
her
way
to
the
great
parlour
where
women
were
circling
about
the
long
mirrors
but
when
she
rejoined
him
she
was
quite
herself
laughing
excited
half
dancing
as
he
took
her
back
to
the
box
she
sat
down
again
her
beautiful
little
head
with
its
innocent
sweep
of
smooth
hair
visible
from
almost
every
part
of
the
house
her
questions
incessant
as
the
blue
eyes
and
the
great
fan
swept
to
and
fro
once
when
she
turned
suddenly
toward
him
in
the
second
she
saw
a
look
on
chris
face
that
gave
her
an
odd
second
of
something
like
fear
but
the
house
darkened
again
before
she
could
analyze
the
emotion
and
norma
glued
her
eyes
to
the
footlights
what
she
did
not
see
was
a
man
not
quite
at
ease
at
his
own
first
grand
opera
not
quite
comfortable
in
his
own
first
evening
dress
lost
and
willingly
lost
among
the
hundreds
who
had
come
in
just
to
stand
far
at
the
back
behind
the
seats
edging
and
elbowing
each
other
changing
feet
and
resting
against
any
or
column
that
offered
itself
and
sitting
down
between
acts
on
the
floor
wolf
was
not
restless
he
was
strong
enough
to
stand
like
an
indian
and
tall
enough
to
look
easily
over
the
surrounding
heads
more
than
that
aïda
did
not
interest
him
in
itself
and
at
some
of
its
most
brilliant
passages
he
was
guilty
of
slipping
away
to
pace
the
hallways
in
solitude
or
steal
to
the
foyer
for
a
brief
cigarette
but
when
the
house
was
lighted
again
he
went
back
into
the
auditorium
and
then
his
eyes
never
left
the
little
dark
head
of
the
girl
who
sat
forward
in
one
of
the
lower
tier
of
boxes
waving
her
big
fan
and
talking
over
her
bare
shoulder
to
one
or
another
of
the
persons
beside
or
behind
her
chapter
xv
it
was
long
afterward
that
norma
dated
from
the
night
of
aïda
a
new
feeling
in
herself
toward
chris
and
the
recognition
of
a
new
feeling
in
chris
toward
her
she
knew
that
a
special
sort
of
friendship
existed
between
them
from
that
time
on
he
had
done
nothing
definite
that
night
he
had
never
done
or
said
anything
that
could
be
held
as
marking
the
change
but
norma
felt
it
and
she
knew
that
he
did
and
somehow
in
that
atmosphere
of
fragrant
flowers
and
women
as
fragrant
of
rustling
silks
and
rich
furs
of
music
and
darkness
and
the
old
passion
of
the
story
it
had
come
to
her
for
the
first
time
that
chris
was
not
only
the
chris
of
alice
room
aunt
marianna
and
leslie
but
her
own
chris
too
a
chris
who
had
his
special
meaning
for
her
as
well
as
for
the
rest
she
liked
him
it
was
natural
that
she
should
especially
and
truly
like
him
almost
all
women
did
for
he
was
of
the
type
that
comes
closest
to
understanding
them
and
he
had
made
their
favour
an
especial
study
chris
could
never
be
indifferent
to
any
woman
if
he
did
not
actively
dislike
her
he
took
pains
to
please
her
and
never
actively
disliking
norma
he
had
from
the
first
constituted
himself
her
guide
and
friend
long
before
he
was
conscious
that
there
was
a
real
charm
to
this
little
chance
member
of
their
group
norma
had
capitulated
utterly
his
sureness
his
pleasant
suggestions
his
positive
approval
or
kindly
protests
had
done
more
to
make
her
first
months
among
the
melroses
happy
than
any
other
one
thing
norma
loved
him
and
was
grateful
to
him
even
when
he
hurt
her
in
the
matter
of
a
note
of
acceptance
of
a
little
act
of
thanks
of
a
gown
or
hat
his
decision
was
absolute
and
she
had
never
known
it
mistaken
besides
this
she
saw
him
everywhere
welcome
everywhere
courted
and
admired
and
everywhere
the
same
chris
handsome
irreproachably
dressed
whether
for
golf
or
opera
adequate
to
the
claims
of
wife
mother
family
or
the
world
she
had
heard
acton
turn
to
him
for
help
in
little
difficulties
she
knew
that
leslie
trusted
him
with
all
her
affairs
and
he
was
as
close
as
any
man
could
be
to
an
intimacy
with
hendrick
von
behrens
quietly
almost
indifferently
he
would
settle
his
round
eyeglasses
on
their
black
ribbon
narrow
his
fine
keen
eyes
and
set
his
firm
jaw
and
take
up
their
problems
one
by
one
always
courteous
always
interested
always
helpful
then
chris
had
charm
as
visible
to
all
the
world
as
to
norma
he
had
the
charm
of
race
of
intelligence
and
education
the
charm
of
a
man
who
prides
himself
upon
his
italian
and
french
upon
his
knowledge
of
books
and
pictures
and
his
capacity
for
holding
his
own
in
any
group
on
any
subject
he
was
quite
frankly
a
collector
a
connoisseur
a
dilettante
in
a
hundred
different
directions
and
he
had
had
leisure
all
his
life
to
develop
and
perfect
his
affectations
in
all
this
new
world
norma
could
not
perhaps
have
discovered
a
man
more
rich
in
just
what
would
impress
her
ignorance
her
newness
to
the
finer
aspects
of
civilization
for
a
few
weeks
after
aïda
as
other
operas
and
annie
tea
and
the
opening
social
life
of
the
winter
softened
the
first
impression
norma
tried
to
tell
herself
that
she
had
imagined
a
little
tendency
on
chris
part
too
well
to
impress
her
with
his
friendliness
she
had
seen
him
flirt
with
other
women
and
indeed
small
love
affairs
of
all
sorts
were
constantly
current
not
only
in
annie
but
in
group
a
certain
laxity
was
in
the
air
and
every
month
had
its
separation
or
divorce
to
be
flung
to
the
gossips
for
dissection
norma
was
not
especially
flattered
at
first
and
rather
inclined
to
resent
the
assurance
with
which
chris
carried
his
tendency
for
philandering
into
his
own
family
as
it
were
but
as
the
full
days
went
by
and
she
encountered
in
him
wherever
they
met
the
same
grave
kindly
attention
the
same
pleasant
mouth
and
curiously
baffling
eyes
in
spite
of
herself
she
began
to
experience
a
certain
breathless
and
and
pride
in
his
affection
he
never
kissed
her
again
never
tried
to
arrange
even
the
most
casual
meeting
alone
with
her
and
never
let
escape
even
a
word
of
more
than
brotherly
friendliness
but
in
leslie
at
tea
time
or
at
some
studio
tea
or
sunday
luncheon
in
a
country
house
he
always
quietly
joined
her
kept
if
possible
within
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
never
had
any
plan
that
would
interfere
with
possible
plans
of
hers
if
she
was
ready
to
go
he
would
drive
her
perhaps
to
discourse
impersonally
upon
the
quality
of
the
pictures
or
the
countryside
mantled
with
snow
upon
the
way
if
she
wanted
a
message
telephoned
a
telegram
sent
even
a
borrowed
book
returned
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
chris
would
of
course
attend
to
it
at
dinner
parties
he
was
rarely
placed
beside
her
hers
was
naturally
the
younger
set
but
he
found
a
hundred
ways
to
remind
her
that
he
was
constantly
attentive
norma
would
feel
her
heart
jump
in
her
side
as
he
started
toward
her
across
a
floor
handsome
perfectly
poised
betraying
nothing
but
generous
interest
in
her
youthful
good
times
as
he
took
his
place
beside
her
so
christmas
came
and
went
and
the
last
affairs
of
the
brief
season
began
to
be
announced
the
last
dances
the
last
dinners
the
functions
as
the
papers
had
it
norma
apologizing
in
one
of
her
flying
calls
on
aunt
kate
for
the
long
intervals
between
visits
explained
that
she
honestly
did
not
know
where
the
weeks
flew
and
are
you
happy
baby
her
aunt
asked
holding
her
close
and
looking
anxiously
into
her
eyes
oh
happy
the
girl
exclaimed
with
a
sort
of
shallow
quick
laugh
that
was
quite
new
of
course
i
am
i
never
in
my
life
dreamed
that
i
could
be
so
happy
i
nothing
left
to
wish
for
except
of
course
that
i
would
like
to
know
where
i
stand
i
would
like
to
have
my
own
position
a
little
more
definite
she
added
but
the
last
phrases
were
uttered
only
in
her
own
soul
and
sheridan
after
a
rather
discontented
scrutiny
of
the
face
she
loved
so
well
was
obliged
to
change
the
subject
chapter
xvi
in
when
an
early
rush
of
almost
summery
warmth
suddenly
poured
over
the
city
chris
and
norma
met
on
the
way
home
from
church
norma
walked
every
sunday
morning
to
the
big
cathedral
but
chris
went
only
once
or
twice
a
year
to
the
fashionable
avenue
church
a
few
blocks
away
this
morning
he
had
joined
her
as
she
was
quietly
leaving
the
house
and
instantly
it
flashed
into
her
mind
that
he
had
deliberately
planned
to
do
so
knowing
that
miss
slater
who
usually
accompanied
her
was
away
for
a
week
vacation
their
conversation
was
impersonal
and
casual
as
always
as
they
walked
along
the
drying
sidewalks
in
the
pleasant
early
freshness
but
as
chris
left
her
he
asked
her
at
about
what
time
she
would
be
returning
and
norma
was
not
surprised
when
she
came
out
of
the
cathedral
a
little
later
than
the
great
first
tide
of
the
outpouring
congregation
to
see
him
waiting
for
her
the
thought
of
him
had
been
keeping
her
heart
beating
fast
and
her
mind
in
confusion
even
while
she
tried
to
pray
and
she
had
thought
that
she
might
leave
the
church
by
one
of
the
big
side
doors
and
so
at
least
run
a
fair
risk
of
missing
him
but
norma
half
feared
an
act
that
would
define
their
deepening
friendship
as
dangerous
and
half
longed
for
the
fifteen
minutes
of
walking
and
chatting
in
the
sunshine
so
she
came
straight
to
him
and
with
no
more
than
a
word
of
greeting
they
turned
north
it
was
an
exquisite
morning
and
the
clean
bare
stretches
of
the
avenue
were
swimming
in
an
almost
summerlike
mist
of
opal
and
blue
such
persons
as
were
visible
in
the
streets
at
all
were
newsboys
idle
policemen
or
women
hurrying
to
or
from
church
and
when
they
reached
the
park
it
was
almost
deserted
the
trees
gently
moving
in
a
warm
breeze
were
delicately
etched
with
the
first
green
of
the
year
maples
and
sycamores
were
dotted
with
new
golden
foliage
and
the
grass
was
deep
and
sweet
a
few
riders
were
ambling
along
the
the
horses
kicking
up
clods
of
the
damp
soft
earth
norma
and
christopher
walked
slowly
talking
the
girl
was
hardly
conscious
of
what
they
said
realizing
suddenly
and
almost
with
terror
that
just
to
be
here
with
chris
was
enough
to
flood
her
being
with
a
happiness
as
new
and
miraculous
as
the
new
and
miraculous
springtime
itself
there
was
no
future
and
no
past
to
this
ecstasy
no
alice
no
world
it
was
enough
in
its
first
bloom
that
it
existed
you
had
what
is
it
a
whole
year
of
us
norma
chris
said
and
on
the
whole
it
been
happy
has
it
fourteen
months
she
corrected
him
fourteen
months
at
least
since
aunt
kate
and
i
called
on
aunt
marianna
yes
it
been
like
a
miracle
chris
i
never
will
understand
it
i
never
will
understand
why
a
friendless
girl
unknown
and
having
absolutely
no
claim
should
have
been
treated
so
wonderfully
and
you
would
want
to
go
back
he
mused
smiling
no
she
said
quickly
i
am
afraid
when
i
think
of
ever
going
back
i
do
see
why
you
should
chris
said
you
will
inherit
through
your
grandmother
will
he
had
been
following
a
train
of
thought
half
to
himself
norma
round
eyes
as
she
stopped
short
in
the
path
arrested
him
my
she
exclaimed
your
aunt
marianna
he
amended
flushing
but
their
eyes
did
not
move
as
they
stared
at
each
other
a
thousand
remembered
trifles
flashed
through
norma
whirling
brain
a
thousand
little
suspicions
leaped
to
new
life
she
had
accepted
the
suggested
kinship
in
childish
acquiescence
but
doubt
was
aflame
now
once
and
for
all
the
man
knew
that
there
was
no
further
evading
her
chris
do
you
know
anything
about
me
she
asked
directly
yes
i
think
i
know
everything
he
answered
after
a
hesitation
norma
looked
at
him
steadily
did
you
know
my
father
and
mother
she
demanded
presently
in
an
odd
tense
voice
there
was
another
pause
before
chris
said
slowly
i
have
met
your
father
but
i
knew
i
know
your
mother
you
her
the
world
was
whirling
about
norma
is
aunt
kate
my
mother
she
asked
breathing
hard
no
i
do
know
why
you
should
not
know
you
call
her
aunt
annie
chris
said
norma
hands
dropped
to
her
sides
she
breathed
as
if
she
were
suffocating
annie
she
whispered
in
stupefaction
and
she
turned
and
walked
a
few
steps
blindly
her
eyes
wide
and
vacant
and
one
hand
pressed
to
her
cheek
my
god
my
god
he
heard
her
say
annie
eloped
when
she
was
a
girl
chris
began
presently
when
she
was
dazedly
walking
on
again
she
was
married
and
the
man
deserted
her
she
was
ill
in
germany
but
shall
i
talk
now
would
you
rather
not
oh
no
no
go
on
norma
said
briefly
alice
was
the
first
to
guess
it
christopher
pursued
her
sister
does
know
it
or
dream
it
aunt
annie
does
she
does
not
know
that
i
her
own
daughter
but
what
she
think
she
supposes
that
her
baby
died
dear
i
sorry
to
tell
you
norma
but
i
could
lie
to
you
you
understand
everything
now
why
your
grandmother
wants
to
make
it
all
up
to
you
does
leslie
know
norma
demanded
suddenly
from
a
dark
moment
of
brooding
nobody
knows
your
aunt
kate
your
grandmother
alice
and
i
are
absolutely
the
only
people
in
the
world
and
norma
else
must
for
the
sake
of
the
family
for
everyone
sake
oh
i
see
that
she
answered
quickly
and
impatiently
and
for
awhile
she
walked
on
in
silence
and
apparently
did
not
hear
his
one
or
two
efforts
to
recommence
the
conversation
aunt
annie
she
said
once
half
aloud
and
later
she
added
absently
yes
i
should
know
they
had
walked
well
up
into
the
park
now
they
turned
back
the
sun
was
getting
hot
first
perambulators
were
making
their
appearance
and
norma
loosened
her
light
furs
so
i
am
a
melrose
she
mused
and
then
abruptly
chris
what
my
name
melrose
he
answered
flushing
her
eyes
asked
a
sudden
horrified
question
and
she
took
the
answer
from
his
look
without
a
word
he
saw
the
colour
ebb
from
her
face
leaving
it
very
white
you
said
they
my
parents
were
married
chris
she
asked
painfully
annie
supposed
they
were
but
he
was
not
free
norma
did
not
speak
again
in
silence
they
crossed
the
avenue
and
went
on
down
the
shady
side
street
chris
with
chosen
words
and
quietly
told
her
the
story
of
annie
girlhood
who
and
what
her
father
had
been
the
bitter
grief
of
her
grandmother
the
general
hushing
up
of
the
whole
affair
he
watched
her
anxiously
as
he
talked
for
there
was
a
drawn
set
look
to
her
face
that
he
did
not
like
why
did
aunt
kate
ever
decide
to
bring
me
to
my
my
grandmother
after
so
many
years
she
asked
i
sure
i
do
know
that
alice
and
i
have
fancied
that
kate
might
have
kept
in
touch
with
your
father
all
this
time
and
that
he
might
be
dead
now
and
not
likely
to
make
trouble
that
is
it
norma
agreed
quickly
because
not
long
before
she
came
to
see
aunt
marianna
she
had
some
sort
of
news
from
canada
i
think
an
old
friend
was
dead
i
remember
it
as
if
it
were
yesterday
then
that
fits
in
chris
said
glad
she
could
talk
but
i
ca
believe
it
she
cried
in
bewilderment
and
suddenly
she
burst
out
angrily
oh
chris
is
it
fair
is
it
fair
that
one
girl
like
leslie
should
have
so
so
much
the
name
the
inheritance
the
husband
and
position
and
the
friends
and
that
another
through
no
fault
of
hers
should
be
just
just
a
nobody
she
choked
and
christopher
made
a
little
protestant
sound
oh
yes
i
am
she
insisted
bitterly
not
recognized
by
my
own
mother
she
my
mother
no
mother
could
listen
dear
chris
begged
really
alarmed
by
the
storm
he
had
raised
your
grandmother
for
reasons
of
her
own
never
told
annie
there
was
a
baby
it
is
obvious
why
she
kept
silent
it
was
only
kindness
decency
annie
was
young
younger
than
you
are
and
poor
old
aunt
marianna
only
knew
that
her
child
was
ill
and
had
been
and
most
cruelly
used
you
were
brought
up
safely
and
happily
with
good
and
loving
people
the
best
in
the
world
norma
said
through
her
teeth
fighting
tears
the
best
in
the
world
why
norma
what
a
woman
they
made
you
you
who
stand
alone
among
all
the
girls
i
know
and
then
chris
continued
quickly
seeing
her
a
little
quieter
when
you
are
growing
up
your
aunt
brings
you
to
your
grandmother
who
immediately
turns
her
whole
world
to
make
you
welcome
is
there
anything
so
unfair
in
that
annie
made
a
terrible
mistake
dear
and
everyone
but
annie
pays
norma
interrupted
bitterly
norma
she
is
your
mother
chris
reminded
her
in
the
tone
that
coming
from
him
always
instantly
affected
her
her
eyes
fell
and
her
tone
when
she
spoke
was
softer
just
bearing
a
child
is
all
motherhood
she
said
no
my
dear
i
know
and
if
annie
were
ever
to
guess
this
it
like
her
not
to
face
the
music
at
any
cost
but
is
it
better
as
it
is
norma
the
wonderful
tone
the
wonderful
manner
the
kindness
and
sympathy
in
his
eyes
norma
with
one
foot
on
the
lowest
step
now
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
a
sort
of
childish
penitence
oh
yes
chris
but
her
lips
trembled
but
if
aunt
kate
had
only
kept
me
from
knowing
for
ever
she
faltered
she
would
take
that
responsibility
dear
and
one
ca
blame
her
a
comfortable
inheritance
comes
from
your
grandmother
it
is
the
enormous
fortune
leslie
inherited
of
course
but
it
is
all
you
would
have
had
even
had
annie
brought
you
home
openly
as
her
daughter
it
is
enough
to
make
a
very
pretty
for
me
to
give
away
with
you
my
dear
in
a
few
years
chris
added
more
lightly
the
suggestion
made
her
face
flame
again
who
would
marry
me
she
said
under
her
breath
with
a
scornful
look
under
lids
into
space
for
answer
he
gave
her
an
odd
glance
one
that
lived
in
her
memory
for
many
and
many
a
day
ah
norma
norma
norma
he
said
quickly
half
laughingly
then
his
expression
changed
and
his
smile
died
away
i
have
something
to
bear
he
said
with
a
glance
upward
toward
alice
windows
life
is
roses
roses
all
the
way
for
any
one
of
us
my
dear
now
you
got
a
bad
bit
of
the
road
ahead
but
let
be
good
sports
norma
and
come
in
now
i
famished
let
have
breakfast
my
honour
is
in
your
hands
he
added
more
gravely
perhaps
i
had
no
right
to
tell
you
all
this
you
must
betray
me
chris
she
responded
warmly
as
if
i
could
he
watched
her
eating
her
breakfast
and
chatting
with
alice
a
little
later
and
told
himself
that
some
of
annie
splendid
courage
had
certainly
descended
to
this
gallant
little
daughter
norma
was
pale
and
now
and
then
her
eyes
would
meet
his
with
a
certain
strained
look
or
she
would
lose
the
thread
of
the
conversation
for
a
few
seconds
but
that
was
all
alice
noticed
nothing
and
in
a
day
or
two
chris
could
easily
have
convinced
himself
that
the
conversation
in
the
spring
greenness
of
the
sunday
morning
had
been
a
dream
chapter
xvii
however
that
hour
had
borne
fruit
and
in
two
separate
ways
had
had
its
distinct
effect
upon
norma
mind
and
soul
in
the
first
place
she
had
a
secret
now
with
chris
and
understanding
that
made
her
most
casual
glance
at
him
significant
and
gave
a
double
meaning
to
almost
every
word
they
exchanged
it
was
at
his
suggestion
that
she
decided
to
keep
the
revelation
from
alice
even
though
she
knew
what
alice
knew
for
alice
was
not
very
well
and
chris
was
sure
that
it
would
only
agitate
and
frighten
the
invalid
to
feel
that
the
family
discreditable
secret
was
just
that
much
nearer
betrayal
so
she
and
chris
alone
shared
the
agitation
strain
and
bewilderment
of
the
almost
overwhelming
discovery
and
norma
in
turning
to
him
for
advice
and
sympathy
deepened
tenfold
the
tie
between
them
but
even
this
result
was
not
so
as
the
effect
of
the
discovery
upon
her
character
everything
that
was
romantic
undisciplined
and
reckless
in
norma
was
fostered
by
the
thought
that
so
thrilling
and
so
secret
a
history
united
her
closely
to
the
melrose
family
that
she
was
leslie
actual
cousin
that
the
closest
of
all
human
relationships
bound
her
to
the
magnificent
von
behrens
were
thoughts
that
excited
in
her
every
dramatic
and
extravagant
tendency
to
which
the
amazing
year
had
inclined
with
her
growing
ease
in
her
changed
environment
and
the
growing
popularity
she
enjoyed
there
came
also
a
sense
of
predestination
the
conviction
that
her
extraordinary
history
justified
her
in
any
act
of
daring
or
of
unconventionality
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
or
sanity
norma
might
tell
herself
at
least
for
those
of
the
melrose
blood
her
shyness
of
the
season
before
had
vanished
and
she
could
plunge
into
the
summer
gaiety
with
an
assurance
that
amazed
even
herself
her
first
meeting
with
annie
after
the
day
of
chris
disclosures
was
an
ordeal
at
which
he
himself
chanced
to
be
a
secretly
thrilled
onlooker
norma
grew
white
and
her
lips
trembled
there
was
a
strained
look
in
her
blue
agonized
eyes
but
annie
entire
unconsciousness
that
the
situation
was
at
all
tense
and
the
presence
of
three
or
four
total
outsiders
helped
norma
to
feel
that
this
amazing
and
dramatic
moment
was
only
one
more
in
a
life
newly
amazing
and
dramatic
and
she
escaped
unnoticed
from
the
trial
the
second
time
was
much
less
trying
and
after
that
norma
showed
no
sign
that
she
ever
thought
of
the
matter
at
all
von
behrens
took
norma
to
her
maine
camp
in
july
and
when
the
girl
joined
the
chris
liggetts
in
august
it
was
for
a
season
of
hard
tennis
golf
polo
dancing
yachting
and
swimming
norma
grew
lean
and
tanned
and
improved
so
rapidly
in
manner
and
appearance
that
alice
felt
concerning
her
certain
fears
that
she
one
day
confided
to
her
mother
it
was
on
an
early
september
day
dry
and
airless
and
they
were
on
the
side
porch
of
the
newport
cottage
you
see
how
pretty
she
growing
mama
alice
said
and
then
in
a
lower
tone
with
a
quick
cautious
glance
about
mama
does
she
often
remind
you
of
annie
melrose
who
had
been
contentedly
rocking
and
drowsing
in
the
heat
paled
with
sudden
terror
and
apprehension
and
looked
around
her
with
sick
and
uneasy
eyes
alice
my
darling
she
stammered
i
know
mama
i
not
going
to
talk
about
it
truly
alice
assured
her
quickly
i
never
even
of
it
she
added
earnestly
no
no
no
that
right
her
mother
agreed
hurriedly
her
soft
old
face
under
the
thin
crimped
gray
hair
was
full
of
distress
mama
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
worry
you
alice
said
distressed
too
do
think
of
it
i
sorry
i
spoke
but
sometimes
even
though
she
is
so
dark
norma
is
so
like
annie
that
it
makes
my
blood
run
cold
if
annie
ever
suspected
that
she
is
well
her
own
daughter
melrose
face
was
ashen
and
she
looked
as
if
touched
by
the
heat
no
no
dear
she
said
with
a
sort
of
terrified
brevity
you
and
chris
were
wrong
there
i
ca
talk
to
you
about
it
alice
she
broke
off
pleadingly
you
must
ask
me
dear
you
said
you
would
she
pleaded
trembling
alice
was
stupefied
for
a
full
minute
she
lay
in
her
pillows
staring
blankly
at
her
mother
she
whispered
at
last
incredulous
and
bewildered
no
dear
poor
annie
no
no
no
norma
mother
is
dead
but
but
you
must
believe
that
mama
is
acting
as
she
believes
to
be
for
the
best
she
interrupted
herself
in
painful
and
hesitating
tones
and
that
i
ca
talk
about
it
now
alice
i
ca
indeed
some
day
mama
darling
alice
cried
really
alarmed
by
her
leaden
colour
and
wild
eyes
please
i
never
speak
of
it
again
why
i
know
that
everything
you
do
is
for
us
all
darling
please
be
happy
about
it
come
on
we
talk
of
something
else
when
do
you
leave
for
town
poole
drives
us
as
far
as
great
barrington
norma
and
me
the
old
lady
began
gaining
calm
as
she
reviewed
her
plans
chris
needed
her
for
a
little
matter
of
business
and
norma
was
anxious
to
see
her
cousin
rose
new
baby
the
conversation
drifted
to
leslie
baby
the
idolized
patricia
who
was
now
some
four
months
old
chapter
xviii
two
days
later
found
norma
happily
seated
beside
the
big
bed
she
and
rose
had
shared
less
than
two
years
ago
where
rose
now
lay
with
the
snuffling
and
mouthing
baby
rolled
deep
in
flannels
beside
her
rose
had
come
home
to
her
mother
for
the
great
event
and
sheridan
was
exulting
in
the
care
of
them
both
just
now
she
was
in
the
kitchen
and
the
two
girls
were
alone
together
norma
a
little
awed
and
a
little
ashamed
of
the
emotion
that
rose
pale
and
rapt
and
radiant
face
gave
her
rose
secretly
pitying
from
her
height
the
woman
who
was
not
yet
a
mother
and
young
liggett
was
terribly
disappointed
that
her
baby
was
a
girl
rose
marvelled
i
did
care
one
bit
only
harry
is
glad
it
a
boy
well
leslie
was
sure
that
hers
was
going
to
be
a
boy
norma
said
and
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
aunt
annie
deciding
that
the
melroses
usually
had
sons
she
have
a
boy
next
rose
suggested
norma
glanced
at
her
polished
adjusted
the
woolly
tan
bag
she
carried
she
says
never
again
she
remarked
airily
rose
clear
forehead
clouded
faintly
and
norma
hastened
to
apologize
well
my
dear
what
she
she
remarked
laughingly
with
quick
fingers
on
hand
it
sad
that
chris
liggett
did
have
just
one
before
her
accident
it
would
make
such
a
difference
in
her
life
rose
mused
with
her
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
on
norma
face
there
was
something
about
norma
that
she
did
not
understand
oh
it
frightfully
sad
norma
agreed
easily
and
because
she
liked
the
mere
sound
of
his
name
she
added
chris
is
fond
of
children
too
then
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
that
even
unsuspicious
rose
thought
odd
she
said
gaily
is
aunt
kate
perfectly
delicious
about
the
nurse
i
knew
she
would
be
of
course
she
does
everything
and
miss
miller
simply
looks
on
well
almost
rose
said
with
an
affectionate
laugh
she
did
want
a
nurse
at
all
but
harry
and
wolf
insisted
and
then
night
before
last
when
i
was
so
ill
it
almost
made
me
laugh
in
spite
of
feeling
so
badly
to
hear
mother
with
miss
miller
better
get
out
of
here
my
dear
i
heard
her
say
is
no
place
for
a
girl
like
you
norma
laugh
rang
out
but
rose
noticed
that
her
face
sobered
immediately
almost
into
sadness
and
that
there
was
a
bitter
line
about
the
lovely
mouth
and
a
shadow
of
something
like
cynicism
in
her
blue
eyes
norma
she
ventured
suddenly
storming
the
fortress
what
is
it
darling
something
worrying
you
nono
ca
you
tell
me
with
the
old
nursery
name
norma
gallant
look
of
amusement
and
reassurance
faltered
she
looked
suddenly
down
at
the
hand
rose
was
holding
and
rose
saw
the
muscles
of
her
throat
contract
and
that
she
was
pressing
her
lips
together
to
keep
them
from
trembling
a
tear
fell
on
the
locked
hands
norma
kept
her
eyes
averted
shook
her
head
is
it
a
man
nono
norma
looked
up
dashed
away
the
tears
and
managed
a
rueful
smile
is
it
always
a
man
she
asked
bravely
rose
still
looked
at
her
anxiously
waiting
for
further
light
but
dearest
surely
he
likes
you
the
other
girl
was
silent
rubbing
her
thumb
slowly
to
and
fro
across
rose
thin
hand
i
do
know
she
answered
after
a
pause
but
of
course
he
does
rose
said
confidently
it
all
come
right
there
no
reason
why
it
should
and
with
all
the
interest
of
their
old
days
of
intimacy
she
asked
eagerly
nono
is
he
handsome
oh
yes
tremendously
and
the
right
age
norma
laughed
half
protestant
rose
are
you
a
little
demon
for
the
third
degree
but
she
liked
it
in
spite
of
the
reluctance
in
her
manner
and
presently
added
i
do
think
age
matters
do
you
not
in
the
least
rose
agreed
norma
does
melrose
know
know
what
norma
parried
know
that
well
that
you
like
him
norma
raised
serious
eyes
looked
unsmilingly
into
rose
smiling
face
nobody
knows
it
it
is
going
right
rose
i
ca
tell
you
about
all
of
it
she
paused
well
i
would
know
the
people
if
you
did
rose
said
sensibly
and
suddenly
she
added
timidly
norma
there
is
another
girl
well
yes
there
is
in
a
way
norma
conceded
after
thought
that
he
likes
better
rose
asked
quickly
no
i
do
think
he
likes
her
better
norma
answered
well
then
rose
summarized
triumphantly
but
there
was
no
answering
flash
from
norma
who
was
looking
down
again
and
who
still
wore
a
troubled
expression
although
as
rose
rejoiced
to
see
it
was
less
bitter
than
it
had
been
rose
she
said
gravely
if
he
was
already
bound
in
honour
if
he
was
promised
to
her
rose
eyes
expressed
quick
sympathy
norma
you
mean
engaged
but
then
how
did
he
ever
come
to
care
for
you
she
followed
it
up
anxiously
i
do
know
norma
said
with
a
shrug
but
nono
why
do
you
think
he
like
you
has
he
said
so
norma
had
freed
her
hand
and
pulled
on
her
rough
little
gloves
now
she
spread
her
five
fingers
and
looked
at
them
with
slightly
raised
brows
and
slightly
compressed
lips
no
she
said
briefly
and
quietly
rose
face
was
full
of
distress
again
she
reached
for
norma
fingers
dearest
i
so
sorry
but
but
it
does
make
you
feel
very
badly
does
it
norma
norma
did
not
answer
ah
it
does
rose
said
pitifully
are
you
so
sure
you
care
at
this
norma
laughed
glanced
for
a
moment
into
far
space
shook
her
head
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
utter
silence
in
the
plain
little
bedroom
then
the
baby
began
to
fuss
and
grope
and
to
make
little
sneezing
faces
in
his
cocoon
of
blankets
just
one
more
word
dear
rose
said
later
when
aunt
kate
had
come
flying
in
and
carried
off
the
new
treasure
and
when
norma
was
standing
before
the
mirror
adjusting
her
summer
hat
if
he
cares
for
you
it
much
much
better
to
make
the
change
now
norma
than
to
wait
until
it
too
late
no
matter
how
hard
or
how
unpleasant
it
is
i
know
norma
agreed
quickly
painfully
stooping
to
kiss
her
be
down
next
month
rose
and
then
i
see
you
oftener
when
do
you
go
rose
said
clinging
to
her
hand
go
back
to
newport
or
at
least
we
get
to
great
barrington
and
we
may
stay
there
with
the
richies
a
few
days
aunt
marianna
hates
to
make
the
trip
in
one
day
so
we
stayed
there
last
night
but
she
had
to
come
down
to
sign
some
papers
chris
has
been
down
all
the
week
and
he
wired
for
her
so
she
and
i
drove
down
together
and
is
the
country
lovely
now
rose
asked
well
dry
but
it
is
beautiful
too
so
hot
and
leafy
and
thunderous
and
where
are
you
at
the
old
house
no
at
a
hotel
up
near
the
park
i
wish
you
and
little
peter
pan
could
get
away
somewhere
rose
for
we
have
another
three
weeks
of
the
heat
oh
my
dear
mother
redding
and
the
baby
and
i
are
going
to
the
berkshires
for
at
least
two
whole
weeks
rose
announced
happily
and
i
thought
that
my
bad
boy
was
coming
in
early
august
she
added
of
the
baby
or
i
would
have
gone
first
try
to
come
oftener
norma
she
pleaded
for
we
all
love
you
so
and
again
norma
manner
worried
her
what
was
there
in
the
sisterly
little
speech
to
bring
the
tears
again
to
norma
eyes
i
know
you
do
rosy
norma
said
very
low
i
wish
i
could
go
up
to
the
berkshires
with
you
well
then
why
do
you
dear
oh
norma
flung
back
her
head
i
do
know
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
lightness
and
two
minutes
later
she
had
kissed
aunt
kate
and
greeted
wolf
in
the
kitchen
and
rose
heard
their
laughter
and
then
the
closing
of
the
front
door
chapter
xix
wolf
walked
with
her
to
the
omnibus
he
had
come
in
tired
with
the
heat
of
the
long
day
but
norma
thought
him
his
sweetest
self
brotherly
good
unsuspicious
and
unaffected
he
complimented
her
on
her
appearance
he
had
a
kind
word
for
harry
redding
for
the
baby
he
told
norma
that
he
and
his
mother
had
gone
to
portland
by
water
a
few
weeks
before
and
had
a
great
spree
norma
tired
and
excited
loved
him
for
his
very
indifference
to
her
affairs
and
her
mood
for
the
simplicity
with
which
he
showed
her
the
book
he
was
reading
and
the
amusement
he
found
all
along
the
dry
and
dusty
and
dirty
street
everything
was
interesting
to
wolf
and
he
made
no
apologies
for
the
general
wiltedness
and
disorder
of
the
neighbourhood
norma
looked
down
at
him
from
the
top
of
the
omnibus
and
thought
that
he
was
a
friendly
and
likable
big
young
man
with
his
rumpled
bare
head
shining
in
the
streaming
merciless
sunlight
she
had
no
idea
that
his
last
look
at
her
was
like
some
precious
canvas
that
a
collector
adds
to
his
treasures
that
to
the
thousands
of
normas
and
bookshop
normas
and
to
the
memorable
picture
of
a
débutante
norma
at
her
first
opera
wolf
carried
away
with
him
one
more
norma
a
brown
norma
in
a
wide
english
hat
and
a
plain
linen
suit
and
transparent
green
silk
stockings
that
matched
her
green
silk
parasol
she
got
down
from
the
omnibus
a
few
blocks
farther
away
and
walked
slowly
along
the
shady
side
of
the
burning
thinking
thinking
thinking
it
was
the
hottest
hour
of
the
afternoon
there
would
be
a
storm
but
just
now
the
air
hung
motionless
and
the
shadows
were
almost
as
dazzling
in
their
baking
dimness
as
the
sunshine
houses
were
closed
and
silent
show
windows
bare
the
omnibuses
creaked
by
loaded
with
passengers
trying
to
get
cool
there
was
an
odour
of
frying
potatoes
other
odours
stale
and
lifeless
crept
through
the
stale
and
lifeless
air
norma
was
entirely
familiar
with
this
phase
of
city
life
for
except
for
sundays
at
coney
island
or
picnicking
on
some
beach
or
in
some
meadow
or
wood
of
connecticut
she
and
the
sheridans
had
weathered
two
successive
hot
seasons
very
comfortably
within
two
hundred
yards
of
broadway
it
held
no
particular
horrors
for
her
she
reflected
that
in
another
hour
or
two
the
sun
would
quite
have
died
away
and
then
every
flight
of
old
brownstone
steps
would
hold
its
chatting
group
and
every
street
its
scores
of
screaming
and
running
children
wherever
her
thoughts
carried
her
they
began
and
ended
with
christopher
he
had
never
kissed
her
again
after
the
night
of
his
return
from
miami
he
had
hardly
touched
even
her
hand
and
he
had
said
no
word
of
love
but
as
the
summer
progressed
these
two
had
grown
steadily
to
live
more
and
more
for
each
other
for
just
the
casual
friendly
looks
and
words
of
ordinary
intercourse
in
the
presence
of
other
persons
and
for
the
chance
hours
that
fate
now
and
then
permitted
them
alone
norma
in
every
other
relationship
grown
more
whimsical
and
more
restless
showing
new
phases
of
frivolity
and
shallowness
to
the
world
had
deepened
and
developed
under
chris
eyes
into
her
own
highest
possibility
of
womanhood
to
him
she
was
earnest
honest
only
anxious
to
be
good
and
to
be
true
he
knew
the
viewpoint
of
that
wiser
self
that
was
the
real
norma
he
knew
how
wide
open
those
blue
eyes
were
to
what
was
false
and
worthless
in
the
world
around
her
and
norma
had
seen
him
change
too
or
perhaps
more
truly
become
himself
still
apparently
the
old
chris
handsome
poised
cynical
and
only
too
ready
to
be
bored
he
went
his
usual
course
of
golf
and
polo
gave
his
men
dinners
kissed
alice
and
departed
for
yachting
or
motoring
trips
even
alice
shut
away
from
reality
in
her
own
world
of
music
and
sweet
airs
flowers
and
friendship
saw
no
change
but
norma
saw
it
she
knew
that
chris
was
no
longer
ready
to
respond
to
every
pretty
woman
idle
challenge
to
a
flirtation
she
knew
that
there
was
a
chris
of
high
ideals
a
chris
capable
even
of
heroism
a
chris
who
loved
simplicity
who
loved
even
service
and
who
was
not
too
spoiled
and
too
proud
to
give
his
time
as
well
as
his
money
to
give
himself
gladly
where
he
saw
the
need
their
hours
alone
together
were
hours
of
enchanting
discovery
memories
of
the
little
boy
that
had
been
chris
the
little
girl
that
had
been
norma
their
hopes
and
ambitions
and
joys
and
sorrows
all
were
exchanged
and
to
them
both
every
word
seemed
of
thrilling
and
absorbing
interest
to
norma
life
now
was
a
different
thing
when
chris
merely
was
in
the
room
however
distant
from
her
however
apparently
interested
in
someone
or
something
else
she
knew
that
he
was
conscious
of
her
thinking
of
her
and
that
presently
she
would
have
just
the
passing
word
or
smile
or
even
quiet
glance
that
would
buoy
her
hungry
soul
like
a
fresh
and
powerful
current
it
was
not
strange
to
her
that
she
should
have
come
to
feel
him
the
most
vital
and
most
admirable
of
all
the
persons
about
her
for
many
of
the
men
and
women
who
loved
chris
shared
this
view
norma
had
not
been
in
the
melrose
house
a
month
before
she
had
heard
him
called
wonderful
inimitable
the
only
chris
a
hundred
times
even
she
told
herself
sometimes
even
the
women
that
chris
quite
openly
disliked
would
not
return
coldness
for
coldness
and
how
much
less
could
she
so
much
younger
resist
the
generous
friendship
he
offered
to
her
ignorance
and
awkwardness
and
strangeness
that
he
saw
in
her
own
companionship
something
to
value
she
had
at
first
been
slow
to
believe
sheer
pride
had
driven
her
to
reluctance
to
shyness
to
unbelief
but
that
was
long
ago
months
ago
norma
knew
now
that
he
truly
liked
her
that
the
very
freshness
and
unconventionality
of
her
viewpoint
delighted
him
and
that
he
gave
her
a
frankness
a
simpleness
and
an
ardour
in
his
confidences
that
would
have
astonished
alice
herself
alice
norma
was
thinking
of
alice
now
just
where
did
alice
come
in
alice
had
always
been
the
most
generous
of
wives
but
she
could
not
be
generous
here
no
human
woman
could
she
liked
norma
in
a
sense
she
needed
norma
but
chris
was
all
her
world
but
good
heavens
norma
mused
as
she
walked
slowly
along
there
to
be
any
friendship
for
a
man
but
his
men
friends
or
any
for
a
woman
except
unmarried
men
is
there
friendship
at
all
between
the
sexes
must
it
always
be
sneaking
and
subterfuge
unless
it
marriage
i
do
want
to
marry
chris
liggett
she
stopped
short
and
the
blood
left
her
heart
suddenly
and
rushed
back
with
a
pounding
that
almost
dizzied
her
do
want
to
marry
chris
she
whispered
aloud
and
then
she
widened
her
eyes
at
space
and
walked
on
blindly
for
a
little
way
oh
chris
chris
chris
she
said
oh
what
shall
i
do
an
agony
almost
physical
in
its
violence
seized
her
and
she
began
to
move
more
rapidly
as
if
to
wear
it
out
or
escape
it
no
no
no
i
ca
care
for
him
in
that
way
said
norma
feeling
her
throat
dry
and
her
head
suddenly
aching
we
ca
we
can
not
like
each
other
that
way
the
rest
of
the
walk
was
a
blank
as
far
as
her
consciousness
was
concerned
she
was
swept
far
away
on
a
rushing
sea
of
memories
memories
confused
and
troubled
by
a
vague
apprehension
of
the
days
to
come
that
was
it
that
was
it
they
loved
each
other
not
as
kinspeople
not
as
friends
not
as
the
chris
and
norma
of
alice
and
leslie
and
annie
lives
but
as
man
and
woman
caught
at
last
in
the
old
old
snare
that
is
the
strongest
in
life
bewildered
and
sick
she
reached
the
cool
great
colonnaded
doorway
of
the
hotel
and
here
she
and
christopher
came
face
to
face
he
was
coming
out
was
indeed
halfway
down
the
stone
steps
they
stood
still
and
looked
at
each
other
norma
thought
that
he
looked
tired
that
perhaps
the
hot
week
in
streets
and
offices
had
been
hard
for
him
he
was
pale
and
the
smile
he
gave
her
was
strained
and
unnatural
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
ten
days
and
norma
drinking
in
every
expression
of
the
firm
mouth
the
shrewd
kindly
eyes
the
finely
set
head
felt
sudden
confidence
and
happiness
flood
her
being
again
it
was
all
nonsense
this
imagining
of
hers
and
she
and
chris
would
always
be
the
best
friends
in
the
world
alice
is
perfectly
splendid
norma
said
in
answer
to
his
first
questions
and
leslie
baby
is
much
less
fat
and
solid
looking
and
getting
to
be
so
cunning
where
is
aunt
marianna
upstairs
he
answered
with
a
slight
backward
inclination
of
his
head
we
had
a
most
satisfactory
day
and
you
and
she
can
get
off
to
great
barrington
without
any
trouble
she
and
i
norma
said
distressed
by
something
cold
and
casual
in
his
manner
but
are
you
coming
too
alice
depends
upon
your
coming
i
ca
i
sorry
to
say
i
may
get
up
on
friday
night
chris
said
with
an
almost
weary
air
of
politeness
friday
why
then
then
i
persuade
aunt
marianna
to
wait
norma
decided
eagerly
you
must
come
with
us
chris
it
quite
lovely
up
through
connecticut
i
very
sorry
the
man
repeated
glancing
beyond
her
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
terminate
the
conversation
but
i
may
not
get
up
at
all
this
week
and
i
arranged
with
aunt
marianna
that
poole
drives
you
up
you
find
her
he
added
lightly
enthusiastic
over
the
pictures
they
really
excellent
and
i
think
leslie
will
be
delighted
and
now
i
have
to
go
norma
but
you
coming
back
to
have
dinner
with
us
the
girl
interrupted
thoroughly
uneasy
at
the
change
in
him
not
i
have
an
engagement
i
see
you
very
soon
the
hat
charming
norma
i
think
you
may
safely
order
more
of
them
by
mail
if
you
have
to
and
with
another
odd
smile
and
his
usually
courteous
bow
he
was
gone
and
norma
was
left
staring
after
him
in
a
state
almost
of
stupefaction
what
was
the
matter
with
him
the
question
framed
itself
indignantly
in
norma
mind
as
she
automatically
crossed
the
foyer
of
the
hotel
and
went
upstairs
mechanically
blindly
she
took
off
the
big
hat
flung
aside
the
parasol
and
went
through
the
uniting
bathroom
into
melrose
room
what
on
earth
had
been
the
matter
with
chris
what
right
had
he
how
dared
he
treat
her
so
rudely
melrose
was
in
a
flowered
chair
near
a
window
she
had
put
on
a
lacy
robe
of
thin
silk
after
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
and
her
feet
were
in
slippers
beside
her
was
a
tall
glass
holding
an
iced
drink
and
before
her
on
a
small
table
regina
had
ranged
the
beautiful
photographs
of
leslie
baby
that
were
to
be
the
young
mother
birthday
surprise
next
week
hello
dear
she
said
in
the
pleasant
almost
cooing
voice
with
which
she
almost
always
addressed
the
girls
of
the
family
is
this
just
a
dreadful
dreadful
day
oh
my
so
hot
look
here
norma
just
see
my
little
patricia
pictures
are
they
perfectly
lovely
i
pleased
with
them
i
was
just
regina
will
you
order
miss
norma
something
cool
to
drink
please
tea
dear
or
lemonade
like
your
old
aunty
i
was
just
showing
them
to
chris
yes
and
he
thought
they
were
just
perfectly
lovely
see
the
little
fat
hand
and
how
beautifully
the
lace
took
there
that
one
the
best
you
see
leslie
will
like
that
one
the
topic
fortunately
for
norma
agitation
was
apparently
inexhaustible
and
the
girl
could
sink
almost
unnoticed
into
an
opposite
chair
and
while
her
voice
dutifully
uttered
sympathetic
monosyllables
and
her
eyes
went
from
the
portraits
of
little
patricia
idly
about
the
big
room
noting
the
handsome
old
maple
furniture
and
the
costly
old
scrolled
velvet
carpet
and
the
aspect
of
flaming
roofs
beyond
the
window
in
the
sunset
her
thoughts
could
turn
and
twist
agonizingly
over
this
new
mystery
and
this
new
pain
what
had
been
the
matter
with
chris
anger
gave
way
to
chill
and
chill
to
utter
heartsickness
the
cause
of
the
change
was
unimportant
after
all
it
was
the
change
itself
that
was
significant
norma
head
ached
her
heart
was
like
lead
she
had
been
thinking
all
the
way
down
in
the
car
all
that
she
would
meet
him
that
they
would
talk
now
what
was
this
endless
evening
to
drag
away
on
his
terms
and
were
they
to
return
to
newport
with
only
the
memory
of
that
cool
farewell
to
feed
norma
starving
starving
soul
chris
could
stay
and
have
dinner
melrose
presently
was
regretting
but
after
all
perhaps
it
cooler
up
here
than
anywhere
and
i
am
so
tired
that
i
not
going
to
change
you
just
have
to
stand
me
as
i
am
and
the
tired
wrinkled
old
face
under
its
fringe
of
gray
hair
smiled
confidently
at
norma
the
girl
smiled
affectionately
back
five
six
it
was
almost
seven
when
norma
came
forth
from
a
cold
bath
and
supervised
the
serving
of
the
little
meal
she
merely
played
with
her
own
food
and
the
old
lady
was
hardly
more
hungry
oh
no
aunt
marianna
i
think
that
leslie
was
just
terribly
nervous
after
patricia
was
born
but
i
think
now
especially
when
they
back
in
their
own
house
they
be
perfectly
happy
no
reason
in
the
world
why
they
should
be
norma
heard
herself
saying
so
they
had
been
talking
of
acton
and
leslie
she
thought
leslie
was
spoiled
and
acton
was
extravagant
and
the
united
families
had
been
just
a
little
worried
about
their
attitudes
toward
each
other
melrose
was
sure
that
norma
was
right
and
rambled
along
the
same
topic
for
some
time
then
norma
realized
that
they
had
somehow
gotten
around
to
theodore
father
this
subject
was
always
good
for
half
hours
together
she
could
safely
ramble
a
little
herself
the
deadly
weight
fell
upon
her
spirit
again
what
had
been
the
matter
with
chris
at
nine
her
tired
old
companion
began
preparations
for
bed
and
norma
catching
up
some
magazines
went
into
her
own
room
she
could
hear
regina
and
melrose
murmuring
together
the
running
of
water
the
opening
and
shutting
of
bureau
drawers
norma
went
to
her
open
window
leaned
out
into
the
warm
and
brilliant
night
there
was
a
hot
moon
moving
between
clouds
that
promised
at
last
a
break
in
the
binding
heat
down
the
avenue
below
her
omnibuses
wheeled
and
rumbled
omnibuses
whose
upper
seats
were
packed
with
thinly
clad
passengers
but
otherwise
there
was
little
life
and
movement
abroad
a
searchlight
fanned
the
sky
fell
and
wavered
upward
again
a
in
the
side
street
poured
forth
the
notes
of
the
marseillaise
suddenly
and
almost
without
volition
the
girl
snatched
the
telephone
and
murmured
a
number
thought
and
senses
seemed
suspended
while
she
waited
is
this
the
metropolitan
club
is
christopher
liggett
there
if
you
will
please
thank
you
say
that
it
is
a
lady
said
norma
in
a
hurried
and
feverish
voice
the
operator
would
announce
presently
of
course
that
liggett
was
not
there
the
chance
that
he
was
there
was
so
remote
chris
she
breathed
all
the
tension
and
doubt
dropping
from
her
like
a
garment
at
the
sound
of
his
quiet
tones
chris
this
is
norma
a
pause
her
soul
died
within
her
what
is
it
chris
asked
presently
in
a
repressed
voice
well
but
were
you
playing
cards
no
you
had
your
dinner
chris
no
yes
i
had
dinner
of
course
i
dined
with
aunt
marianna
no
that
was
lunch
i
dined
here
chris
norma
faltered
speaking
quickly
as
her
courage
ebbed
i
did
want
to
interrupt
you
but
you
seemed
so
so
different
this
afternoon
and
i
did
want
to
have
you
cross
at
me
and
i
wondered
i
been
wondering
ever
since
if
i
have
done
something
that
made
you
angry
that
was
stupid
and
and
she
stopped
the
forbidding
silence
on
his
part
was
like
a
wall
that
crossed
her
path
was
like
a
veil
that
blinded
and
choked
her
not
at
all
he
said
quickly
where
did
you
get
that
idea
hello
hello
are
you
there
norma
he
added
when
on
her
part
in
turn
there
was
a
blank
silence
for
norma
strangled
by
an
uprising
of
tears
as
sudden
as
it
was
unexpected
and
overwhelming
could
make
no
audible
answer
why
she
should
be
crying
she
could
not
clearly
think
but
she
was
bathed
in
tears
and
her
heart
was
heavy
with
unspeakable
desolation
norma
she
heard
him
say
urgently
what
is
it
norma
nothing
she
managed
to
utter
in
a
voice
that
stemmed
the
flood
for
only
a
second
norma
chris
said
simply
i
am
coming
out
meet
me
downstairs
in
ten
minutes
i
want
to
see
you
both
telephones
clicked
and
norma
found
herself
sitting
blankly
in
the
sudden
silence
of
the
room
her
brain
filled
with
a
confusion
of
shamed
and
doubting
and
fearful
thoughts
and
her
heart
flooded
with
joy
five
minutes
later
she
stepped
from
the
elevator
into
the
lobby
and
selected
a
big
chair
that
faced
obliquely
on
the
entrance
doors
the
little
stir
in
the
wide
brightly
lighted
place
always
interested
her
and
amused
her
women
drifting
from
the
with
their
light
wraps
over
their
arms
messengers
coming
and
going
the
far
strains
of
the
orchestra
mingling
pleasantly
with
the
nearer
sounds
of
feet
and
voices
her
spirit
was
soaring
nothing
mattered
nothing
of
her
doubts
nothing
of
his
coldness
except
that
chris
was
even
now
coming
toward
her
her
mind
followed
the
progress
of
his
up
through
the
hot
deserted
streets
suddenly
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
not
bear
the
emotion
of
meeting
with
every
man
figure
that
came
through
the
doors
her
heart
thumped
and
pounded
his
voice
she
would
hear
it
again
she
would
see
the
gray
eyes
and
watch
the
firm
quick
movement
of
his
jaw
other
men
meeting
other
women
or
parting
from
other
women
came
and
went
norma
liked
the
big
homely
boy
in
olive
drab
who
kissed
the
little
homely
mother
so
affectionately
she
glanced
at
her
wrist
watch
twisted
about
to
confirm
its
unwelcome
news
by
the
big
clock
quarter
to
ten
and
no
chris
norma
settled
down
again
to
waiting
and
watching
ten
quarter
past
ten
he
was
not
coming
no
although
her
sick
and
weary
spirit
rose
whenever
there
was
the
rush
of
a
to
the
curb
or
the
footstep
of
a
man
on
the
steps
outside
she
knew
now
that
he
was
not
coming
hope
deferred
had
exhausted
her
but
hope
dead
was
far
far
worse
he
was
not
coming
it
was
almost
ten
when
a
approached
was
it
miss
sheridan
christopher
liggett
had
been
called
out
of
town
and
would
try
to
see
melrose
in
a
day
or
two
norma
turned
upon
him
a
white
face
of
fatigue
is
liggett
on
the
telephone
no
miss
he
just
telephoned
a
message
the
boy
retired
and
norma
went
slowly
upstairs
and
slowly
made
her
preparations
for
sleep
but
the
blazing
summer
dawn
smiting
the
city
at
four
found
her
still
sitting
at
the
window
twirling
a
tassel
of
the
shade
in
her
cold
fingers
and
staring
with
haggard
eyes
into
space
chapter
xx
more
than
a
week
later
annie
gave
a
luncheon
to
a
dozen
women
and
telephoned
norma
beforehand
with
a
request
that
the
girl
come
early
enough
to
help
her
with
name
cards
these
damnable
engagement
luncheons
said
aunt
annie
limping
about
the
long
table
and
grumbling
at
everything
as
she
went
annie
had
wrenched
her
ankle
in
alighting
from
her
car
and
was
cross
with
nagging
pain
here
put
natalie
next
to
leslie
norma
no
that
puts
the
gunnings
together
i
give
you
miss
blanchard
but
you
do
speak
french
here
give
me
your
pencil
and
confound
these
things
anyway
fowler
she
said
to
the
butler
i
do
like
to
see
a
thing
like
that
on
the
table
carry
that
away
please
and
here
get
somebody
to
help
you
change
this
that
wo
do
that
all
right
only
i
want
this
as
you
had
it
day
before
yesterday
and
do
use
those
get
the
glass
ones
and
so
fussing
and
changing
and
criticizing
annie
went
away
and
norma
followed
her
up
to
her
bedroom
i
wondering
when
we
going
to
give
an
engagement
luncheon
norma
said
the
hostess
in
a
whirl
of
rapid
dressing
who
ahead
now
oh
nobody
norma
answered
with
a
mirthless
laugh
she
had
been
listless
and
pale
for
several
days
and
did
not
seem
herself
at
all
forrest
duer
is
it
oh
good
heavens
aunt
annie
he
is
that
all
he
such
a
big
whale
do
touch
my
hair
phoebe
it
do
very
well
said
annie
to
the
maid
well
do
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
norma
she
went
on
kindly
nothing
like
being
sure
that
annie
glanced
at
the
retiring
maid
that
what
makes
me
nervous
about
leslie
she
confessed
i
afraid
we
hurried
the
child
into
it
just
a
little
bit
it
was
an
understood
thing
since
they
were
nothing
but
kiddies
leslie
is
outrageously
spoiled
norma
said
not
unkindly
leslie
oh
horribly
mama
always
spoils
everyone
and
poor
theodore
spoiled
her
too
annie
conceded
she
told
me
herself
yesterday
norma
went
on
with
a
trace
of
her
old
animation
that
they
overdrawn
again
now
aunt
annie
i
do
think
that
outrageous
chris
straightened
them
all
out
last
when
was
it
june
after
the
baby
came
and
they
have
an
enormous
income
thousands
every
month
and
yet
they
are
deep
in
again
the
wretched
thing
is
that
they
quarrel
about
that
annie
agreed
well
exactly
that
was
what
it
was
about
day
before
yesterday
and
leslie
told
me
she
cried
all
night
and
you
know
the
other
day
she
took
patricia
and
came
home
to
aunt
marianna
and
it
was
terrible
how
much
do
you
suppose
the
servants
know
of
that
annie
asked
frowning
oh
they
know
norma
replied
foolish
foolish
child
you
know
norma
annie
resumed
leslie
comes
by
her
temper
naturally
she
is
half
french
her
mother
was
a
frenchwoman
louison
courtot
it
a
pretty
name
norma
commented
did
you
know
her
know
her
she
was
my
maid
when
i
was
about
seventeen
a
very
superior
girl
i
used
to
practise
my
french
with
her
she
was
extremely
pretty
after
my
father
died
my
mother
and
i
went
to
florida
and
when
we
came
back
the
whole
thing
broke
i
thought
it
would
kill
mama
at
first
we
thought
theodore
had
simply
gotten
her
into
to
use
the
dear
old
phrase
but
du
she
had
certificate
all
safe
and
sound
but
he
was
no
more
in
love
with
her
than
i
was
a
boy
nineteen
mama
made
her
leave
the
house
and
cut
off
allowance
entirely
and
for
a
while
they
were
together
but
it
last
teddy
got
his
divorce
when
he
went
with
mama
to
california
but
he
was
ill
then
though
we
did
know
it
poor
boy
he
lived
five
years
after
that
but
he
saw
leslie
oh
dear
yes
annie
said
buffing
her
twinkling
idly
did
mama
ever
tell
you
about
that
no
she
never
mentions
it
well
that
was
awful
too
for
poor
mama
about
four
years
after
the
divorce
one
night
when
we
were
all
at
home
it
was
just
after
mama
and
i
came
back
from
europe
and
the
year
before
hendrick
and
i
were
married
suddenly
there
was
a
rush
in
the
hall
and
in
came
wife
louison
courtot
it
seems
mama
had
been
in
touch
with
her
ever
since
we
returned
but
none
of
us
knew
that
and
she
had
leslie
with
her
a
little
thing
about
four
years
old
leslie
just
faintly
remembers
it
she
had
fought
mama
off
at
first
about
giving
her
baby
up
but
now
she
was
going
to
be
married
and
she
had
finally
consented
to
do
as
mama
wanted
leslie
came
over
to
me
and
got
into
my
lap
and
went
to
sleep
i
remember
theodore
was
terribly
ill
and
i
remember
that
louison
was
quite
gentle
with
him
surprised
us
all
in
fact
she
was
so
mild
she
had
been
a
wild
thing
but
always
most
a
prude
in
fact
she
even
stooped
over
theodore
and
kissed
him
and
then
she
knelt
down
and
kissed
leslie
and
went
away
mama
had
intended
that
she
should
always
see
the
child
if
she
wanted
to
but
she
never
came
again
she
was
married
i
know
a
few
weeks
later
and
long
afterward
mama
told
me
that
she
was
dead
ted
came
to
adore
the
baby
and
of
course
she
been
the
greatest
comfort
to
mama
so
it
all
turns
out
right
after
all
but
we
a
sweet
family
finished
annie
rising
to
go
downstairs
and
now
she
added
on
the
stairs
if
there
were
to
be
serious
trouble
between
acton
and
leslie
well
it
is
thinkable
leslie
herself
charming
in
a
flowered
silky
dress
with
a
wide
flowery
hat
on
her
yellow
hair
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
big
shaded
hallway
the
little
matron
was
extremely
attractive
in
her
new
dignities
and
her
babyish
face
looked
more
ridiculously
youthful
than
ever
as
she
talked
of
my
husband
my
little
girl
my
house
and
my
attorney
leslie
like
annie
and
alice
was
habitually
wrapped
in
her
own
affairs
more
absorbed
in
the
question
of
her
own
minute
troubles
than
in
the
most
widespread
abuses
of
the
world
when
leslie
saw
a
coat
the
identity
of
the
wearer
interested
her
far
less
than
the
primary
considerations
of
the
coat
cut
and
material
and
the
secondary
decision
whether
or
not
she
herself
would
like
such
a
garment
consequently
she
glanced
but
apathetically
at
norma
she
had
seen
the
dotted
blue
swiss
before
and
the
cornflower
hat
she
had
seen
aunt
annie
french
organdie
there
was
nothing
there
either
to
envy
or
admire
how
the
baby
dear
and
how
acton
annie
asked
perfunctorily
leslie
sighed
oh
they
both
fine
she
answered
indifferently
i
been
all
upset
because
my
cook
got
married
just
walked
out
i
told
acton
not
to
pay
her
but
of
course
he
did
it
nothing
to
him
if
my
whole
house
is
upset
by
the
selfishness
of
somebody
else
he
and
chris
are
going
off
this
afternoon
with
joe
and
denny
page
for
the
thousand
islands
i
did
know
chris
was
here
annie
said
in
surprise
i
did
myself
he
came
up
with
acton
late
last
night
motored
all
the
way
i
was
asleep
when
they
got
in
i
did
know
it
until
i
found
him
at
breakfast
this
morning
norma
heart
stood
still
the
name
alone
was
enough
to
shake
her
to
the
very
soul
but
the
thought
that
he
was
here
in
newport
this
minute
and
that
she
might
not
see
him
probably
indeed
would
not
see
him
made
her
feel
almost
faint
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
meeting
on
the
hotel
steps
nearly
two
weeks
ago
it
had
been
the
longest
and
the
saddest
two
weeks
in
life
it
was
in
vain
that
she
reminded
herself
that
her
love
for
him
was
weakness
and
madness
and
that
by
no
possible
shift
of
circumstances
could
it
come
to
happy
consummation
it
was
in
vain
that
she
pondered
alice
claims
and
all
the
family
claims
and
the
general
claim
of
society
as
an
institution
deep
and
strong
and
unconquerable
above
them
all
rose
the
tide
of
love
and
passion
the
gnawing
and
burning
hunger
for
the
sight
of
him
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
touch
of
his
hand
life
had
become
for
her
a
vague
and
changing
dream
with
his
name
for
its
only
reality
somewhere
in
the
fog
of
days
was
chris
and
she
would
not
live
again
until
she
saw
him
he
must
forgive
her
he
must
explain
his
coldness
explain
the
change
in
him
and
then
she
would
be
content
just
with
the
old
friendliness
just
the
old
nearness
and
the
occasional
word
together
every
letter
that
joseph
brought
her
every
call
to
the
telephone
meant
to
her
only
the
poignant
possibility
of
a
message
from
him
she
sickened
daily
with
fresh
despair
and
fed
herself
daily
with
new
hopes
she
was
scarcely
conscious
of
the
hilarious
progress
of
the
luncheon
she
looked
at
the
prospective
bride
in
whose
honour
aunt
annie
entertained
only
with
a
pang
of
wonder
what
was
it
like
the
knowledge
that
one
was
openly
beloved
the
miraculous
right
to
plan
an
unclouded
future
together
the
mere
thought
of
being
free
to
love
chris
of
having
him
free
to
claim
her
almost
dizzied
norma
with
its
vista
of
utter
felicity
she
had
to
drive
it
resolutely
from
her
mind
not
that
never
that
but
there
must
at
least
be
peace
and
friendship
between
them
at
three
the
luncheon
was
over
it
was
three
when
leslie
and
she
drove
to
the
melrose
cottage
as
the
frame
house
was
called
norma
had
searched
the
drive
with
her
eyes
as
they
approached
the
gray
roadster
was
not
there
there
was
no
sign
of
christopher
hat
or
coat
in
the
hallway
alice
was
alone
in
her
downstairs
norma
heart
sank
like
a
lump
of
ice
did
you
see
chris
the
invalid
began
happily
we
had
the
nicest
lunch
together
just
we
two
and
look
at
the
books
the
angel
brought
me
just
a
feast
you
saw
him
leslie
did
you
dear
he
said
he
caught
you
and
acton
at
breakfast
i
was
perfectly
amazed
miss
slater
moved
me
out
here
about
eleven
and
i
heard
someone
walking
in
he
off
now
with
the
pages
he
told
you
that
of
course
he
looks
rotten
i
think
leslie
offered
i
told
him
he
was
working
too
hard
well
judge
lee
is
sick
and
he
has
been
in
to
the
office
since
june
alice
said
and
that
makes
it
very
hard
for
chris
but
he
says
his
room
at
the
club
is
cool
and
now
he
have
two
or
three
lovely
days
with
the
page
boys
norma
who
had
subsided
quietly
into
a
chair
was
looking
at
the
yellow
covers
of
the
new
french
and
italian
novels
and
then
does
he
come
back
here
monday
for
the
tennis
she
asked
clearing
her
throat
he
says
not
alice
answered
regretfully
he
going
straight
on
down
to
the
city
then
next
is
the
cruise
with
the
dwights
and
after
that
i
suppose
we
all
be
home
she
went
on
into
a
conversation
with
leslie
relative
to
the
move
after
a
few
moments
norma
went
out
through
the
opened
french
window
onto
the
wide
porch
it
was
rather
a
dark
side
porch
with
an
elaborate
wooden
railing
and
potted
hydrangeas
under
a
striped
awning
the
house
had
neither
the
magnificence
of
annie
mansion
or
the
beauty
of
leslie
colonial
white
and
green
at
glen
cove
it
had
been
built
in
the
late
eighties
and
was
inflexibly
ornate
norma
went
down
slowly
through
the
garden
and
walked
vaguely
toward
the
hot
glitter
and
roll
of
the
blue
sea
her
misery
was
almost
unbearable
weeks
it
would
be
weeks
before
she
would
see
him
he
had
been
here
here
in
the
garden
in
alice
room
and
she
had
not
had
a
word
or
a
sign
children
and
nurses
were
on
the
beach
grouped
in
the
warm
shade
the
season
was
over
there
were
yellow
leaves
in
the
hedges
norma
feet
rustled
among
the
dropped
glory
of
the
old
trees
the
world
seemed
hot
dry
lifeless
before
her
i
wish
i
were
dead
she
cried
passionately
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
chapter
xxi
suddenly
and
smoothly
they
were
all
transported
to
town
again
and
the
vigour
and
sparkle
of
the
autumn
was
exhilarating
to
norma
in
spite
of
herself
the
park
was
a
glory
of
red
and
gold
leaves
morning
came
late
and
the
dew
shone
until
ten
bright
mists
rose
smoking
into
the
sunlight
and
when
norma
walked
home
from
a
luncheon
or
from
an
hour
of
furious
squash
or
tennis
at
the
club
the
early
winter
dusk
would
be
closing
softly
in
the
mists
returning
and
the
lights
of
the
long
mall
in
the
park
blooming
round
and
blue
in
the
twilight
she
was
with
melrose
this
winter
an
arrangement
extremely
welcome
to
the
old
lady
who
was
lonely
and
liked
the
stir
of
young
life
in
the
house
alice
had
quite
charmingly
and
naturally
suggested
the
change
and
norma
belongings
had
been
moved
away
from
the
little
white
room
next
to
miss
slater
one
reason
for
it
was
that
alice
had
had
two
nurses
all
summer
long
and
found
the
increased
service
a
great
advantage
then
mama
was
all
alone
and
not
so
well
as
she
had
been
getting
old
and
reluctant
to
take
even
the
necessary
exercise
and
then
you
too
young
to
be
shut
up
with
stupid
folk
like
chris
and
me
alice
had
told
norma
lightly
your
stupidity
is
proverbial
aunt
alice
norma
had
laughed
she
did
not
care
where
she
went
any
more
chris
had
greeted
her
casually
upon
their
meeting
in
october
and
had
studiously
if
inconspicuously
ignored
her
but
even
to
see
him
at
all
was
so
great
a
relief
to
her
heart
that
for
weeks
this
was
enough
she
must
meet
him
occasionally
she
heard
his
name
every
day
and
she
knew
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
doing
almost
at
every
moment
she
treasured
every
look
every
phrase
of
his
and
she
glowed
and
grew
beautiful
in
the
conviction
that
even
though
he
was
still
mysteriously
angry
with
her
he
had
that
old
consciousness
of
her
presence
too
he
might
hate
her
but
he
could
not
ignore
her
and
then
in
december
the
whole
matter
reached
a
sudden
crisis
and
norma
came
to
feel
that
she
would
have
been
glad
to
have
the
matter
go
back
to
this
state
of
doubt
and
indecision
again
von
behrens
was
on
the
directorate
of
a
working
girls
club
that
needed
special
funds
every
winter
and
this
year
the
money
was
to
be
raised
by
an
immense
entertainment
at
which
generous
professional
singers
were
to
be
alternated
on
a
brilliant
programme
with
society
girls
and
men
in
tableaux
and
choruses
norma
who
had
a
charming
if
not
particularly
strong
voice
was
early
impressed
into
service
because
she
was
so
so
dependable
and
pretty
and
young
enough
to
carry
off
a
delectable
costume
the
song
she
sang
had
been
specially
written
for
the
affair
and
in
the
quaint
dance
that
accompanied
it
she
was
drilled
by
the
dance
authority
of
the
hour
a
chorus
of
eight
girls
and
eight
men
was
added
to
complete
the
number
and
the
gaiety
of
the
rehearsals
and
the
general
excitement
and
interest
carried
the
matter
along
to
the
last
and
dress
rehearsal
with
a
most
encouraging
rush
annie
had
originally
selected
chris
for
norma
companion
in
the
song
for
chris
had
a
pleasant
presentable
voice
and
chris
in
costume
was
always
adequate
to
any
rôle
theatricals
had
been
his
delight
all
his
life
long
and
among
the
flattering
things
that
were
commonly
said
of
chris
was
that
he
had
robbed
the
stage
of
a
great
character
actor
but
chris
had
begged
off
to
take
a
minor
part
in
another
and
norma
had
a
youth
named
roy
gillespie
for
her
partner
roy
was
a
big
fat
blond
boy
and
stupid
and
rather
in
love
with
norma
and
as
the
girl
was
entirely
unconscious
of
annie
original
plan
she
was
quite
satisfied
with
him
the
dress
rehearsal
was
on
a
dark
thursday
afternoon
before
the
saturday
of
the
performance
it
took
place
in
the
big
empty
auditorium
where
it
was
to
drag
along
from
twelve
noon
until
the
preparations
for
the
regular
evening
performance
drove
the
amateurs
protesting
away
snow
was
fluttering
down
over
the
city
when
annie
with
norma
and
a
limousine
full
of
properties
reached
the
place
at
noon
were
wheeling
and
crowding
in
the
side
street
and
it
seemed
to
norma
thrilling
to
enter
so
confidently
at
the
big
dirty
door
lettered
stage
door
no
admittance
as
always
to
the
outsider
the
wings
the
shabby
the
novel
feeling
of
sauntering
across
the
big
dim
stage
the
gloom
of
the
great
rising
arch
of
the
house
were
full
of
charm
voices
and
hammers
were
sounding
in
the
gloom
somebody
was
talking
hard
while
he
fitfully
played
the
piano
girls
were
giggling
and
fluttering
about
footlights
flashed
up
and
down
in
the
front
rows
of
seats
a
few
mothers
and
maids
had
gathered
there
was
the
sweet
strong
smell
of
some
spicy
disinfectant
and
obscure
figures
up
the
aisles
were
constantly
sweeping
and
stooping
annie
had
a
chair
in
a
wing
her
small
fur
hat
and
trim
suit
had
been
selected
for
comfort
her
knees
were
crossed
and
she
had
a
sheaf
of
songs
a
pencil
and
various
in
her
hands
she
was
alert
serious
authoritative
her
manner
expressed
an
anxious
certainty
that
everything
that
could
possibly
go
wrong
was
about
to
do
so
men
protested
jovially
to
annie
girls
whimpered
and
complained
maids
delivered
staggering
messages
into
her
ear
annie
frowningly
yet
sympathetically
sent
them
all
away
one
by
one
persisted
that
the
rehearsal
proceed
never
mind
the
hat
we
could
get
along
without
the
hat
never
mind
dixie
jadwin
someone
could
read
her
part
never
mind
this
never
mind
that
go
on
go
on
we
must
get
on
at
five
she
was
very
tired
and
norma
fully
arrayed
was
tired
too
the
girl
had
been
sitting
on
a
barrel
for
almost
an
hour
patiently
waiting
for
the
tardy
roy
gillespie
to
arrive
and
permit
their
particular
song
to
be
rehearsed
everything
that
could
be
done
in
the
way
of
telephoning
had
been
done
gillespie
had
left
his
office
he
was
expected
momentarily
at
his
home
he
should
be
given
the
message
immediately
nothing
to
do
but
wait
suddenly
norma
heart
jumped
to
her
throat
began
to
hammer
wildly
a
man
had
come
quietly
in
between
her
and
annie
and
she
heard
the
voice
that
echoed
in
her
heart
all
day
and
all
night
it
was
chris
he
did
not
see
her
perhaps
did
not
recognize
her
in
a
casual
glance
and
began
to
talk
to
his
in
low
quick
tones
almost
immediately
annie
exclaimed
in
consternation
and
called
norma
norma
chris
tells
me
that
poor
old
gillespie
died
this
afternoon
what
been
the
matter
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
now
i
declare
it
much
norma
got
off
her
barrel
the
great
lighted
stage
seemed
to
be
moving
about
her
as
she
went
to
join
them
what
chris
saw
strained
his
tried
soul
to
its
utmost
of
endurance
he
had
not
permitted
himself
to
look
at
her
squarely
for
weeks
now
there
was
a
new
look
a
look
a
little
sad
a
little
wistfully
expectant
in
the
lovely
face
her
eyes
burned
deeply
blue
above
the
touch
of
rouge
and
the
crimson
lips
her
dark
soft
hair
fell
in
loose
ringlets
on
her
shoulders
from
under
the
absurd
little
tipped
and
veiled
hat
of
the
late
seventies
her
gown
a
flowered
muslin
moved
and
tilted
with
a
gentle
shaking
majesty
over
hoop
skirts
and
was
crossed
on
the
low
shoulders
by
a
thin
silk
shawl
whose
long
fringes
were
tangled
in
her
mitted
fingers
the
white
lace
stockings
began
where
the
loose
lace
pantalettes
stopped
and
disappeared
into
kid
slippers
norma
carried
a
bright
nosegay
in
lace
paper
and
on
her
breast
a
thin
gold
locket
hung
on
a
velvet
ribbon
she
herself
had
been
completely
captivated
by
the
costume
when
madame
modiste
had
first
suggested
it
and
when
the
first
fittings
began
but
that
was
weeks
ago
and
she
was
accustomed
to
it
now
and
conscious
in
this
instant
of
nothing
but
chris
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
possibility
that
he
would
have
a
word
or
a
smile
at
last
for
her
stay
right
here
both
of
you
do
move
a
step
while
i
telephone
lucia
street
said
the
harassed
annie
her
eyes
glittering
with
some
desperate
hope
she
hurried
away
they
were
alone
poor
old
roy
he
adored
his
father
chris
said
with
dry
lips
and
in
a
rather
unnatural
voice
norma
for
one
second
simulated
mere
sympathy
then
with
a
rush
the
pride
and
hurt
that
had
sustained
her
ever
since
that
weary
september
evening
in
the
hotel
lobby
vanished
and
she
came
close
to
chris
so
that
the
fragrance
and
sweetness
of
her
enveloped
him
and
caught
his
coat
with
both
her
mitted
hands
and
raised
her
face
imploringly
commandingly
to
his
chris
for
god
sake
what
have
i
done
do
you
know
do
you
know
that
you
killing
me
he
looked
down
at
her
wretchedly
and
suddenly
norma
knew
not
that
he
liked
her
not
that
she
fascinated
and
interested
him
not
that
they
were
friends
but
that
he
loved
her
with
every
fibre
of
his
being
even
as
she
loved
him
the
revelation
carried
her
senses
away
with
it
upon
a
raging
sea
of
emotion
and
ecstasy
he
drew
her
into
a
dim
corner
of
the
wings
and
put
his
arms
about
her
and
her
whole
slender
body
in
its
tilting
hoops
strained
backward
under
the
passion
and
fury
of
his
first
embrace
again
and
again
his
lips
met
hers
and
she
heard
the
incoherent
outpouring
of
murmured
words
and
felt
the
storm
that
shook
him
as
it
was
shaking
her
norma
after
the
first
kiss
grew
limp
let
herself
rest
almost
without
movement
in
his
arms
shut
her
eyes
reason
came
back
to
them
slowly
the
girl
almost
rocking
upon
her
feet
as
the
vertigo
and
bewilderment
passed
and
the
man
sustaining
her
with
an
arm
about
her
shoulders
neither
looking
at
the
other
so
several
seconds
perhaps
a
full
minute
went
by
while
the
world
settled
into
place
about
them
the
dingy
unpainted
wood
of
the
wings
the
stage
where
absorbed
groups
of
people
were
still
coming
and
going
the
distant
gloom
of
the
house
so
now
you
know
chris
said
breathlessly
panting
and
looking
away
from
her
with
his
hands
hanging
at
his
sides
now
you
know
i
tried
to
keep
it
from
you
but
now
now
you
know
norma
also
breathing
hard
did
not
answer
for
a
little
space
i
known
since
that
time
we
were
in
town
in
september
she
said
almost
defiantly
chris
looked
toward
her
surprised
and
their
eyes
met
i
known
what
was
the
matter
with
she
added
thoughtfully
even
frowning
a
little
in
her
anxiety
to
make
it
all
clear
but
i
could
imagine
what
it
was
with
but
this
brought
him
to
face
her
so
close
that
she
felt
the
same
sense
of
drowning
of
losing
her
footing
again
chris
please
she
whispered
in
terror
but
norma
say
it
say
that
you
love
me
that
all
that
matters
now
i
been
losing
my
mind
i
think
i
been
losing
my
mind
just
that
that
you
do
care
i
have
tears
came
to
her
lifted
blue
eyes
and
she
brushed
them
away
without
moving
her
gaze
from
him
i
think
i
have
always
loved
you
chris
from
the
very
first
she
whispered
instantly
she
saw
his
expression
change
it
was
as
if
with
that
revelation
a
new
responsibility
began
for
him
here
dear
you
must
cry
he
said
composedly
he
gave
her
his
handkerchief
helped
her
set
the
tipped
hat
and
lace
veil
straight
smiled
reassurance
and
courage
into
her
eyes
i
see
you
norma
we
talk
he
said
oh
my
god
to
talk
to
you
again
come
now
we
have
to
be
here
when
annie
comes
back
that
right
i
i
love
the
little
gown
terribly
sweet
i
have
seen
it
before
you
know
my
crowd
has
done
all
its
rehearsing
at
hitchcock
annie
now
christopher
said
annie
in
deadly
almost
angry
earnest
as
she
came
up
desperate
and
weary
you
have
to
sing
this
thing
with
norma
burgess
street
absolutely
refuses
he
in
the
chorus
and
he
sings
but
he
simply
wo
do
a
solo
his
mother
says
he
has
a
cold
and
so
on
and
i
swear
i
throw
the
whole
thing
up
i
will
indeed
rather
than
have
this
number
ruined
there
no
earthly
reason
why
you
ca
do
both
of
course
the
poor
old
man
could
help
dying
but
if
you
knew
my
dear
girl
of
course
i
do
it
all
the
youth
and
buoyancy
that
had
been
missing
from
his
voice
for
weeks
had
come
back
christopher
laughed
his
old
delightful
laugh
i
have
to
have
roy
costume
cut
down
but
smithers
will
do
it
for
me
i
do
my
very
best
oh
chris
god
bless
you
annie
said
you
do
it
better
than
he
ever
did
take
my
car
and
stop
for
his
suit
and
express
decent
the
funeral
will
be
saturday
morning
and
we
all
have
to
go
but
there
no
help
for
it
and
come
to
my
house
for
dinner
and
you
and
norma
can
go
over
it
afterward
you
poor
girl
you
tired
out
but
it
such
a
godsend
to
have
chris
fill
in
and
it
will
be
the
prettiest
number
of
all
tired
out
the
radiant
girl
who
was
tripping
away
to
change
to
street
attire
was
hardly
conscious
that
her
feet
touched
the
ground
the
stage
the
theatre
the
fur
coat
into
which
she
buttoned
herself
the
fragrance
of
the
violets
she
wore
were
all
touched
with
beauty
and
enchantment
snow
was
still
falling
softly
when
she
and
annie
went
out
to
the
car
annie
was
so
exhausted
that
she
could
hardly
move
but
norma
floated
above
things
mortal
the
dark
sidewalk
was
powdered
with
what
scrunched
under
their
shoes
like
dry
sugar
and
up
against
the
lighted
sky
the
flakes
were
twirling
and
falling
the
air
was
sweet
and
cold
and
pure
after
the
hot
theatre
chris
put
them
in
the
he
would
see
his
tailor
have
a
bite
of
dinner
at
home
and
be
at
annie
at
eight
for
the
rehearsal
i
do
something
for
you
for
this
norma
her
aunt
assured
the
girl
gratefully
norma
protested
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
singing
it
was
nothing
at
all
she
felt
suddenly
happy
and
light
it
was
all
right
there
was
to
be
no
more
agony
and
doubt
alice
should
lose
nothing
the
world
should
know
nothing
but
chris
loved
her
she
could
take
his
friendship
fearlessly
there
would
be
nothing
but
what
was
good
and
beautiful
and
true
between
them
but
what
a
changed
world
what
a
changed
room
it
was
into
which
she
danced
to
brush
her
hair
for
dinner
and
laugh
into
her
mirror
where
the
happy
girl
with
starry
eyes
and
blazing
cheeks
laughed
back
what
a
changed
dinner
table
at
which
the
old
lady
drowsed
and
cooed
norma
blood
was
dancing
her
head
was
in
a
whirl
she
was
hardly
conscious
that
this
soaring
and
singing
soul
of
hers
had
a
body
at
eight
she
and
melrose
went
to
von
behrens
and
norma
and
chris
went
through
the
song
again
and
again
and
again
for
the
benefit
of
a
small
circle
of
onlookers
hendrick
who
had
sworn
that
wild
horses
would
not
drag
him
to
the
entertainment
sat
with
a
small
son
in
his
lap
and
applauded
tirelessly
annie
criticized
and
praised
alternately
melrose
went
to
sleep
and
annie
new
secretary
a
small
lean
dark
girl
of
perhaps
passionately
played
the
music
norma
knew
exactly
how
this
girl
felt
how
proud
she
was
of
her
position
how
anxious
to
hold
it
and
how
infinitely
removed
from
her
humble
struggle
the
beautiful
miss
sheridan
seemed
yet
she
herself
had
been
much
the
same
less
than
two
years
ago
norma
could
have
laughed
aloud
she
envied
no
one
the
mystery
and
miracle
of
chris
love
for
her
was
like
an
ermine
mantle
about
her
shoulders
and
like
a
diadem
upon
her
brows
annie
was
delighted
with
her
and
presently
told
her
she
had
never
before
sung
so
well
i
suppose
practice
makes
perfect
the
girl
answered
innocently
she
was
conscious
of
no
hypocrisy
no
actress
enjoying
a
part
could
have
rejoiced
in
every
word
and
gesture
more
than
she
just
to
move
under
his
eyes
to
laugh
or
to
be
serious
to
listen
dutifully
to
annie
and
the
old
lady
to
flirt
with
baby
piet
was
ecstasy
enough
they
had
small
opportunity
for
asides
but
that
was
of
no
consequence
all
the
future
was
their
own
they
would
see
each
other
or
next
day
it
did
not
matter
norma
hungry
heart
had
something
to
remember
now
a
very
of
memories
she
could
have
lived
for
weeks
upon
this
one
day
memories
norma
and
chris
were
placed
toward
the
centre
of
the
first
half
of
the
programme
on
the
triumphant
saturday
night
and
could
escape
from
the
theatre
before
eleven
to
go
home
to
tell
alice
all
about
it
chris
played
the
song
on
his
own
piano
and
norma
modestly
and
charmingly
went
through
it
again
to
the
invalid
great
satisfaction
alice
when
norma
and
her
mother
were
gone
tried
to
strike
a
spark
of
enthusiasm
from
her
husband
as
to
the
girl
beauty
and
talent
but
chris
was
pleasantly
unresponsive
she
got
through
it
very
nicely
they
all
did
chris
admitted
indifferently
when
you
think
of
the
upbringing
she
had
chris
a
little
nameless
nobody
alice
pursued
when
you
think
that
until
last
year
she
had
actually
never
seen
a
or
spoken
to
a
servant
exactly
chris
said
briefly
alice
who
was
facing
the
fire
did
not
see
him
wince
she
was
far
from
suspecting
that
he
had
at
that
moment
a
luncheon
engagement
for
the
next
day
with
norma
and
that
during
the
weeks
that
followed
they
met
by
appointment
almost
every
day
and
frequently
by
chance
more
often
than
that
chapter
xxii
in
the
beginning
these
were
times
brimful
of
happiness
for
norma
she
would
meet
chris
far
down
town
among
the
big
cold
snowbound
and
they
would
loiter
for
two
hours
at
some
inconspicuous
table
in
a
restaurant
and
come
wandering
out
into
the
cold
streets
still
talking
absorbed
and
content
or
she
would
rise
before
him
from
a
chair
in
one
of
the
foyers
of
the
big
hotels
at
tea
time
and
they
would
find
an
unobserved
corner
for
the
murmur
that
rose
and
fell
rose
and
fell
inexhaustibly
tea
and
toast
unobserved
before
them
music
drifting
unheard
about
them
furred
and
fragrant
women
coming
and
going
all
this
was
but
the
vague
setting
for
their
own
thrilling
drama
of
love
and
confidence
they
would
come
out
into
the
darkness
norma
tucking
herself
beside
him
in
the
roadster
last
promises
and
last
arrangements
made
until
sometimes
the
girl
even
accompanied
him
to
alice
room
to
sit
at
the
invalid
knee
and
chatter
with
a
tact
and
responsiveness
that
alice
found
an
improvement
upon
her
old
amusing
manner
so
free
was
norma
in
these
days
from
any
sense
of
guilt
that
she
felt
herself
nothing
but
generous
toward
alice
in
sparing
the
older
woman
some
of
the
excess
of
joy
and
companionship
in
which
she
was
so
rich
but
very
swiftly
the
first
complete
satisfaction
in
the
discovery
of
their
mutual
love
began
to
wane
or
rather
to
be
overset
with
the
difficulties
by
which
norma
and
many
another
more
brilliant
and
older
woman
must
inevitably
be
worsted
her
meetings
with
chris
innocent
and
open
as
they
seemed
were
immediately
threatened
by
the
sordid
danger
of
scandal
to
meet
him
once
twice
times
even
was
safe
enough
but
when
each
day
of
separation
became
for
them
both
only
an
agony
of
waiting
until
the
next
day
that
should
unite
them
and
when
all
norma
was
not
enough
to
keep
her
from
the
telephone
summons
that
at
least
gave
her
the
sound
of
his
voice
then
the
world
began
to
be
cognizant
that
something
was
in
the
air
the
very
maids
at
melrose
house
knew
that
miss
sheridan
was
never
available
any
more
never
to
be
traced
to
the
club
to
young
liggett
or
to
von
behrens
house
with
a
telephone
message
or
an
urgent
letter
leslie
knew
that
norma
hated
girls
luncheons
annie
asked
hendrick
idly
why
he
supposed
the
child
was
always
taking
long
walks
or
saying
that
she
took
long
walks
and
hendrick
later
speculating
himself
as
to
the
inaccessibility
of
chris
was
perhaps
the
first
in
the
group
to
suspect
the
truth
a
quite
accidental
and
innocent
hint
from
annie
overwhelmed
norma
with
shame
and
terror
and
she
and
chris
in
earnest
consultation
decided
that
they
must
be
more
discreet
but
this
was
slow
and
difficult
work
after
the
radiant
first
plunge
into
danger
despite
their
utmost
resolution
chris
would
find
her
out
norma
would
meet
him
halfway
and
even
under
leslie
very
eyes
or
in
old
melrose
actual
presence
the
telephone
message
or
the
quicker
signals
of
eyes
and
smile
would
forge
the
bond
afresh
even
when
norma
really
did
start
off
heroically
upon
a
bracing
winter
walk
determined
to
shake
off
in
solitude
and
exercise
the
constant
hunger
for
his
presence
torturing
possibilities
would
swarm
into
her
mind
and
weaken
her
almost
while
she
thought
them
banished
she
could
catch
him
at
his
club
she
might
have
just
five
minutes
of
him
did
she
choose
to
telephone
perhaps
she
would
resist
the
temptation
and
go
home
nervous
excitable
the
evening
stretching
endlessly
before
her
without
him
aunt
annie
and
hendrick
coming
leslie
and
acton
coming
the
prospect
of
the
decorous
family
dinner
would
drive
her
almost
to
madness
she
would
dress
in
a
feverish
dream
answer
old
melrose
absently
or
impatiently
speculating
all
the
time
about
him
where
was
he
when
would
they
meet
again
and
then
perhaps
leslie
would
casually
remark
that
chris
had
said
he
would
join
them
for
coffee
or
joseph
would
summon
her
gravely
to
the
telephone
then
norma
began
to
live
again
the
effect
of
the
lonely
walk
and
the
heroic
resolutions
swept
away
nothing
nothing
was
in
the
world
but
the
sound
of
that
reassuring
voice
or
the
prospect
of
that
ring
at
the
bell
and
that
step
in
the
hall
so
matters
went
on
for
several
weeks
but
they
were
weeks
of
increasing
uneasiness
and
pain
for
norma
and
she
knew
that
chris
found
them
even
less
endurable
than
she
the
happy
hours
of
confidence
and
happiness
grew
fewer
and
fewer
and
as
their
passion
strengthened
and
the
insuperable
obstacles
to
its
natural
development
impressed
them
more
and
more
forcibly
miserable
and
anxious
times
took
their
place
their
love
was
no
sooner
acknowledged
than
both
came
to
realize
how
mad
and
hopeless
it
was
and
that
no
reiteration
of
its
intensity
and
no
argument
could
ever
give
them
a
gleam
of
hope
if
norma
had
drifted
cheerfully
and
recklessly
into
this
situation
she
paid
for
it
now
when
petty
restrictions
and
conventions
stung
her
like
so
many
bees
and
when
she
could
turn
nowhere
for
relief
from
constant
heartache
and
the
sickening
monotony
of
her
thoughts
she
could
not
have
chris
she
could
not
give
him
up
hours
with
him
were
only
a
degree
more
bearable
than
hours
without
him
when
he
spoke
hopefully
of
a
possible
change
of
something
making
their
happiness
possible
she
would
turn
on
him
like
a
little
virago
yet
if
he
despaired
tears
would
come
to
norma
eyes
and
she
would
beg
him
almost
angrily
to
change
his
tone
or
she
would
disgrace
them
both
by
beginning
to
cry
norma
grew
thin
and
fidgety
able
to
concentrate
her
mind
on
nothing
and
openly
indifferent
to
the
society
she
had
courted
so
enthusiastically
a
year
ago
it
was
a
part
of
her
suffering
that
she
grew
actually
to
dislike
alice
always
so
suave
and
cheerful
always
so
serenely
sure
of
chris
devotion
what
right
had
this
woman
who
had
been
rich
and
spoiled
and
guarded
all
her
life
to
hold
him
away
from
the
woman
he
loved
chris
had
been
chained
to
this
couch
for
years
reading
playing
his
piano
infinitely
solicitous
and
sympathetic
but
was
he
to
spend
all
his
life
thus
was
there
to
be
no
glorious
companionship
no
adventure
no
deep
and
satisfying
love
for
chris
ever
in
this
world
norma
wished
no
ill
to
alice
but
she
hated
a
world
that
could
hold
alice
claim
legitimate
why
should
it
be
so
she
said
to
chris
one
day
bitterly
why
when
all
my
life
was
going
so
happily
did
i
have
to
fall
in
love
with
you
i
wonder
it
could
so
easily
have
been
somebody
else
i
do
know
chris
answered
soberly
flinging
away
his
cigarette
and
folding
his
arms
over
his
chest
as
he
stared
through
a
screen
of
bare
trees
at
the
river
it
was
a
march
day
of
warm
airs
and
bursting
buds
the
roads
were
running
water
and
every
bank
and
meadow
oozed
the
thawing
streams
but
there
was
no
green
yet
chris
had
come
for
the
girl
at
three
just
as
she
was
starting
out
for
one
of
her
aimless
unhappy
tramps
and
had
carried
her
off
for
a
run
to
the
quiet
corner
of
the
tavern
porch
in
tarrytown
where
they
were
having
tea
i
suppose
that
just
life
things
go
so
rottenly
sometimes
norma
eyes
watered
as
she
pushed
the
untasted
toast
away
from
her
cupped
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
stared
at
the
river
in
her
turn
chris
if
i
could
go
back
i
think
i
never
speak
to
you
she
said
wretchedly
you
must
say
that
he
reproached
her
my
darling
surely
brought
you
some
happiness
i
suppose
so
norma
conceded
lifelessly
after
a
silence
but
i
ca
go
on
she
protested
suddenly
i
ca
keep
this
up
i
suppose
i
done
something
very
wicked
to
be
punished
this
way
but
chris
i
loved
you
from
the
very
first
day
i
ever
saw
you
in
bookstore
i
think
i
ca
sleep
she
stammered
piteously
and
i
am
so
afraid
all
the
time
afraid
of
what
the
man
asked
very
low
she
faced
him
honestly
you
know
what
of
you
of
me
it
ca
go
on
you
know
that
and
yet
and
norma
looked
far
away
her
beautiful
weary
eyes
burning
in
her
white
face
and
yet
i
ca
stop
it
she
whispered
oh
chris
do
let
fool
ourselves
she
interrupted
his
protest
impatiently
weeks
ago
ago
we
said
that
we
would
see
each
other
less
that
it
would
taper
off
we
tried
it
no
use
if
we
were
in
different
cities
in
different
families
even
i
tell
myself
that
it
will
grow
less
and
less
she
added
presently
as
the
man
watched
her
in
silence
but
oh
my
god
how
long
the
years
ahead
look
and
norma
put
her
head
down
on
the
table
pressed
her
white
fingers
suddenly
against
her
eyes
with
a
gesture
infinitely
desolate
and
despairing
and
he
knew
that
she
was
in
tears
then
there
was
a
long
silence
look
here
norma
said
chris
suddenly
in
a
quiet
reasonable
tone
i
am
i
had
affairs
several
times
in
my
life
two
or
three
before
i
married
alice
two
or
three
since
they
never
been
very
serious
never
gone
very
deep
when
we
were
married
i
was
i
know
women
like
to
pretend
that
i
an
awful
killer
when
i
get
going
he
interrupted
himself
to
say
boyishly
but
there
was
really
never
anything
of
that
sort
in
my
life
i
liked
alice
i
remember
my
mother
talking
to
me
a
long
time
and
telling
me
how
pleased
everyone
would
be
if
we
came
to
care
for
each
other
and
upon
my
honour
i
was
more
surprised
than
anything
else
to
think
that
any
one
so
pretty
and
sweet
would
marry
me
i
do
think
there
a
woman
in
the
world
that
i
admire
more
but
norma
i
lived
her
life
for
ten
years
i
want
my
own
now
i
want
my
companion
my
chum
my
wife
i
played
with
women
since
i
was
seventeen
but
i
never
loved
any
woman
before
norma
there
no
life
ahead
for
me
without
you
and
there
no
place
so
far
so
lonely
so
strange
but
what
it
would
be
heaven
for
me
if
you
were
there
looking
at
me
as
you
are
now
and
with
this
little
hand
where
it
belongs
my
dear
the
city
is
a
blank
the
men
i
meet
might
just
as
well
be
wooden
indians
i
ca
breathe
and
i
ca
eat
or
sleep
get
better
it
gets
worse
it
ca
go
on
she
was
crying
again
they
were
almost
alone
now
a
red
spring
sun
was
sinking
far
down
the
river
and
all
the
world
the
opposite
shores
the
running
waters
of
the
hudson
was
bathed
in
the
exquisite
glow
norma
fumbled
with
her
left
hand
for
her
little
handkerchief
her
right
hand
clinging
tight
to
chris
hand
now
norma
i
been
thinking
the
man
said
in
a
tone
after
a
pause
the
first
consideration
is
that
this
sort
of
thing
ca
go
on
no
this
ca
go
on
she
agreed
quickly
every
day
makes
it
more
dangerous
and
less
satisfying
i
never
her
eyes
watered
again
i
never
have
a
happy
second
she
said
chris
looked
at
her
looked
thoughtfully
away
the
great
trouble
with
the
way
i
feel
to
you
norma
he
said
quietly
is
that
it
seems
to
blot
every
other
earthly
consideration
from
view
i
see
nothing
i
think
nothing
i
hear
nothing
but
you
and
is
that
so
terrible
norma
asked
touched
and
smiling
through
tears
no
it
is
so
wonderful
he
answered
gravely
that
it
blinds
me
it
blinds
me
to
your
youth
my
dear
your
inexperience
your
faith
in
me
it
makes
me
only
remember
that
i
need
you
and
want
you
and
that
i
believe
i
could
make
you
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
the
faint
shadow
of
a
frown
crossed
her
forehead
and
she
slowly
shook
her
head
not
divorce
she
said
lightly
but
inflexibly
they
had
been
over
this
ground
before
no
there
no
use
in
thinking
of
that
even
if
it
were
not
for
aunt
alice
and
aunt
marianna
other
things
make
it
impossible
you
see
that
chris
yes
i
know
she
interrupted
herself
quickly
as
chris
protested
i
know
what
plenty
of
good
people
and
the
law
and
society
generally
think
but
of
course
it
would
mean
that
we
could
not
live
here
for
awhile
anyway
no
that
not
thinkable
no
that
not
thinkable
he
agreed
slowly
i
am
bound
hand
and
foot
it
is
only
what
alice
as
a
wife
claims
from
me
but
there
are
acton
and
leslie
there
is
hardly
a
month
that
my
brother
propose
some
plan
that
would
utterly
wreck
their
affairs
if
i
did
put
my
foot
down
they
both
absolute
children
in
money
matters
judge
lee
is
getting
old
there
no
one
to
take
my
place
your
aunt
marianna
too
i
always
managed
everything
for
her
no
i
tied
his
voice
fell
for
awhile
they
sat
silent
in
the
lingering
cool
spring
twilight
while
the
red
glow
faded
slowly
from
the
river
and
from
the
opposite
banks
where
houses
and
roofs
showed
between
the
bare
trees
but
what
can
we
do
norma
i
tried
i
tried
a
thousand
times
to
see
the
future
without
you
but
i
simply
ca
go
on
living
on
those
terms
there
nothing
nothing
nothing
i
go
to
the
piano
and
before
i
touch
a
note
the
utter
blank
futility
of
it
comes
over
me
and
sickens
me
it
the
same
in
the
office
and
at
the
club
i
seem
to
be
only
half
alive
if
it
could
be
even
five
years
ahead
or
ten
years
ahead
i
would
wait
but
it
never
never
no
hope
nothing
to
live
for
life
is
simply
over
only
one
does
die
the
girl
had
never
heard
quite
this
note
of
despair
from
him
before
and
her
heart
sank
you
are
young
he
said
after
a
minute
and
in
a
lighter
tone
and
perhaps
some
day
no
do
believe
that
chris
norma
said
quietly
and
with
a
gesture
full
of
pain
she
leaned
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
pressed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
there
will
never
be
anybody
else
she
said
how
could
there
be
you
are
the
only
person
like
yourself
that
i
have
ever
known
the
simplicity
of
her
words
almost
their
childishness
made
eyes
smart
he
bit
his
lips
trying
to
smile
it
too
bad
is
it
he
said
whimsically
norma
flung
back
her
head
swallowing
tears
she
gathered
gloves
and
got
to
her
feet
he
followed
her
as
she
walked
across
the
darkening
porch
they
went
down
to
the
curving
sweep
of
driveway
where
the
car
waited
the
big
lighted
eyes
of
other
cars
picking
it
out
in
the
gloom
the
saturated
ground
gave
under
norma
feet
the
air
was
soft
and
full
of
the
odorous
promise
of
blossom
and
leaf
a
great
star
was
trembling
in
the
opal
sky
which
still
palpitated
toward
the
horizon
with
the
pale
pink
and
blue
of
the
sunset
dry
branches
clicked
above
their
heads
in
a
sudden
soft
puff
of
breeze
norma
as
she
tucked
herself
in
beside
chris
felt
emotionally
exhausted
felt
a
sudden
desperate
need
for
solitude
and
silence
the
world
seemed
a
lonely
and
cruel
place
almost
without
a
word
he
drove
her
home
to
the
old
melrose
house
and
came
in
with
her
to
the
long
dim
for
a
brief
he
had
not
kissed
her
more
than
two
or
three
times
since
the
memorable
night
of
the
dress
rehearsal
but
he
kissed
her
and
norma
felt
something
solemn
something
renunciatory
in
the
kiss
they
had
but
an
unsatisfactory
two
or
three
minutes
together
melrose
might
descend
upon
them
at
any
second
was
indeed
audible
in
the
hall
when
chris
said
suddenly
you
are
not
as
brave
as
your
mother
norma
she
met
his
eyes
with
something
like
terror
in
her
own
standing
still
a
few
feet
away
from
him
with
her
breath
coming
and
going
stormily
no
she
said
in
a
sharp
whisper
not
a
moment
later
she
was
flying
upstairs
her
blue
eyes
still
dilated
with
fright
her
face
pale
and
her
senses
rocking
unseeing
unhearing
she
reached
her
own
room
paced
it
distractedly
moving
between
desk
and
window
and
bed
like
some
bewildered
animal
sometimes
she
put
her
two
hands
over
her
face
the
spread
fingers
pressed
against
her
forehead
sometimes
she
stood
perfectly
still
arms
hanging
at
her
sides
eyes
blankly
staring
ahead
once
she
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
and
buried
her
burning
cheeks
against
the
delicate
linen
and
embroideries
regina
came
in
norma
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
control
herself
she
saw
a
gown
laid
on
the
bed
heard
bath
water
running
faced
her
own
haggard
self
in
the
mirror
as
she
began
dressing
but
when
the
maid
was
gone
and
norma
somewhat
pale
but
quite
again
was
dressed
for
dinner
she
lifted
from
its
place
on
her
a
little
picture
of
chris
and
herself
taken
the
summer
before
and
studied
it
with
sorrowful
eyes
he
had
been
teaching
her
to
ride
and
norma
was
radiant
and
in
her
and
skirted
coat
her
cloud
of
hair
loosened
and
her
smart
little
hat
in
one
hand
chris
like
all
men
was
always
at
his
best
in
sports
clothes
the
head
of
his
favourite
mare
looked
mildly
over
his
shoulder
behind
the
group
stretched
the
exquisite
reaches
of
the
great
trees
heavy
with
summer
foliage
and
heat
norma
touched
her
lips
to
the
glass
chris
chris
chris
she
said
half
aloud
i
love
you
so
and
i
have
brought
you
of
all
men
to
this
to
the
point
when
you
would
throw
it
all
aside
everything
your
wonderful
and
generous
life
has
stood
for
for
me
god
said
norma
softly
putting
the
picture
down
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
do
let
me
do
anything
that
will
hurt
him
and
shame
him
help
me
help
us
both
a
few
minutes
later
she
went
down
to
dinner
which
commenced
auspiciously
with
the
old
lady
in
a
gracious
and
expansive
mood
and
her
guests
old
judge
lee
and
his
wife
and
old
doctor
and
turner
sufficiently
intimate
and
sufficiently
reminiscent
to
absolve
norma
from
any
conversational
duty
the
girl
could
follow
her
own
line
of
heroic
and
resolute
thought
uninterruptedly
but
with
the
salad
came
utter
rout
again
and
norma
colour
and
heart
and
breath
began
to
fluctuate
in
a
renewed
agony
of
hope
and
fear
it
was
only
joseph
leaning
deferentially
over
judge
lee
shoulder
who
said
softly
christopher
liggett
judge
he
has
telephoned
that
he
would
like
to
see
you
for
a
moment
after
dinner
and
will
be
here
at
about
nine
the
dinner
went
on
for
norma
in
a
daze
at
a
quarter
to
nine
she
went
upstairs
she
was
standing
in
the
dark
upper
hallway
at
the
window
when
chris
came
saw
him
leave
his
car
and
come
quickly
across
the
sidewalk
under
the
bare
moving
boughs
of
the
old
maples
she
was
trembling
with
the
longing
just
to
speak
to
him
again
just
to
hear
his
voice
she
went
to
her
room
rang
for
regina
meditating
a
message
of
that
should
include
a
headache
as
excuse
but
before
the
maid
came
she
went
quickly
downstairs
and
into
his
presence
as
instinctively
as
a
drowning
man
might
cling
to
anything
that
meant
air
just
the
essential
air
they
could
not
exchange
a
word
alone
but
that
was
not
important
the
one
necessity
was
to
be
together
before
ten
norma
went
back
to
her
room
she
undressed
and
put
on
a
loose
warm
robe
and
seated
herself
before
the
fireplace
when
regina
came
she
asked
the
girl
to
put
out
all
the
lights
voices
floated
up
from
the
front
hall
the
great
entrance
door
closed
the
motors
wheeled
away
the
guests
were
gone
chris
was
gone
norma
heard
old
melrose
come
upstairs
heard
her
door
shut
then
there
was
silence
silence
eleven
struck
from
madison
tower
midnight
struck
even
the
streets
were
quieter
now
the
squares
of
moonlight
shifted
on
floor
went
away
the
fire
died
down
the
big
room
was
warm
and
dim
and
very
still
hugged
in
her
warm
wrap
curled
into
her
big
chair
the
girl
sat
like
some
tranced
creature
thinking
thinking
thinking
at
first
her
thoughts
were
of
terror
and
shame
in
what
fool
paradise
had
she
been
drifting
she
asked
herself
contemptuously
that
she
and
chris
reasonable
man
and
woman
could
be
reduced
to
this
fearful
and
wretched
position
could
even
consider
even
name
what
their
sane
senses
must
shrink
from
in
utter
horror
norma
was
but
but
she
knew
that
there
was
only
one
end
to
that
road
so
that
way
was
closed
even
to
the
brimming
tide
that
rose
up
in
her
when
she
thought
of
it
and
flooded
her
whole
being
with
the
ecstatic
realization
of
her
love
for
chris
and
of
what
surrender
to
him
would
mean
that
way
was
closed
she
must
tell
herself
over
and
over
for
her
own
sake
for
the
sake
of
aunt
kate
and
aunt
marianna
for
rose
even
she
must
not
think
of
that
above
all
for
his
sake
for
chris
the
fine
good
chris
of
her
first
friendship
she
must
be
strong
and
norma
at
this
point
in
her
circling
and
confused
thoughts
would
drop
her
face
in
the
crook
of
her
bent
arm
and
the
tears
would
brim
over
again
and
again
she
was
not
strong
she
could
not
be
strong
and
she
was
afraid
chapter
xxiii
regina
coming
through
the
hallway
at
seven
was
amazed
to
encounter
miss
sheridan
evidently
fresh
from
a
bath
a
black
hat
tipped
over
her
smiling
eyes
and
her
big
fur
coat
belted
about
her
vigil
had
lasted
until
after
two
but
then
she
had
had
four
hours
of
restful
sleep
for
she
knew
that
she
had
found
the
way
she
left
a
message
with
regina
for
melrose
she
was
going
to
sheridan
and
would
telephone
in
a
day
or
two
smiling
she
slipped
out
into
the
quiet
street
where
the
autumn
sunlight
was
just
beginning
to
strike
across
the
damp
pavements
and
smilingly
she
disappeared
into
the
great
currents
of
men
and
women
who
were
already
pouring
to
and
fro
along
the
main
thoroughfares
but
she
did
not
go
quite
as
far
as
her
aunt
after
all
for
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
she
waited
on
the
corner
of
the
block
walking
slowly
to
and
fro
watching
the
house
closely
then
wolf
sheridan
came
out
and
set
off
at
his
usual
brisk
walk
toward
the
subway
norma
stepped
before
him
trembling
and
smiling
nono
for
the
lord
sake
where
did
you
come
from
he
took
her
from
her
as
she
caught
his
arm
drew
him
aside
and
looked
up
at
him
with
her
old
childish
air
of
coaxing
wolf
i
been
waiting
for
you
wolf
i
in
trouble
she
laughed
at
his
concern
not
real
trouble
she
reassured
him
quickly
but
but
and
suddenly
tears
came
and
she
found
she
could
not
go
on
is
it
a
man
wolf
asked
looking
down
at
her
with
everything
that
was
brotherly
and
kind
in
his
young
face
yes
norma
answered
not
raising
her
eyes
from
the
overcoat
button
that
she
was
pushing
in
and
out
of
its
hold
wolf
she
added
quickly
i
afraid
of
him
and
afraid
of
myself
you
you
told
me
months
ago
she
looked
up
suffocating
i
know
what
i
told
you
wolf
said
clearing
his
throat
and
do
you
still
feel
that
way
you
know
i
do
norma
wolf
said
more
concerned
for
her
emotion
than
his
own
do
you
do
you
want
me
to
send
this
this
fellow
about
his
business
oh
no
she
said
laughing
nervously
i
do
want
any
one
to
know
it
nobody
must
dream
it
i
ca
marry
him
i
shall
never
marry
him
but
he
wo
let
me
alone
wolf
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
getting
no
nearer
her
point
and
now
she
seized
her
courage
in
both
hands
and
looked
up
at
him
bravely
will
you
take
care
of
me
she
faltered
i
mean
i
mean
as
your
wife
do
you
mean
wolf
began
then
his
expression
changed
and
his
colour
rose
norma
you
do
mean
that
yes
but
i
do
she
said
exquisite
and
flushed
and
laughing
in
the
sweet
early
sunlight
you
mean
that
you
will
marry
me
wolf
asked
dazedly
she
answered
fired
by
his
look
of
awe
and
amazement
and
rapture
all
combined
i
want
to
be
safe
she
added
quickly
i
trust
you
more
than
any
other
man
i
know
i
loved
you
like
a
little
sister
all
my
life
ah
norma
you
darling
you
darling
he
said
but
are
you
sure
oh
quite
sure
norma
turned
him
toward
broadway
her
little
arm
linked
in
his
do
we
go
along
together
nicely
she
asked
gaily
norma
my
god
if
you
knew
how
i
love
you
how
i
longed
for
you
but
i
ca
believe
it
i
never

it
what
made

do
it
her
face
sobered
for
a
second
just
needing
you
i
suppose
wolf
her
colour
rose
i
want
you
to
know
who

chris

man

wolf
asked
in
healthy
distaste
the
man
i
afraid
of
she
answered
honestly
but
lord
wolf
exclaimed
simply

has
a
wife
i
know
it
the
girl
said
quickly
but
i
wanted
you
to
know
i
want
you
to
know
why
i
running
away
from
them
all
relief
rang
in
her
voice
as
his
delighted
eyes
showed
no
cloud
that
all
she
said
norma
i
ca
my
god
i
ca
tell
whether

or
dreaming
wolf
was
all
joy
again
we
wait
a

he
paused
suddenly

in

street
and
put

two
hands
on

shoulders

said
and

my
wedding
day
chapter
xxiv
to
rose
and
her
mother
wolf
and
norma
marriage
remained
one
of
the
beautiful
surprises
of
life
one
of
the
things
that
as
sane
mortals
they
had
dared
neither
to
dream
nor
hope
life
had
been
full
enough
for
mother
and
daughter
and
sweet
enough
that
march
morning
even
without
the
miracle
the
baby
had
been
bathed
in
a
flood
of
dancing
sunshine
and
had
had
his
breakfast
out
under
the
budding
bare
network
of
the
grape
arbour
the
little
house
had
been
put
into
spotless
order
while
he
slept
and
rose
had
pinned
on
her
winter
hat
and
gone
gaily
to
market
with
exactly
one
dollar
and
cents
in
her
purse
and
she
had
come
back
to
find
her
mother
standing
beside
the
shabby
in
the
tiny
backyard
looking
down
thoughtfully
at
the
sleeping
child
and
evidently
under
the
impression
that
she
was
peeling
the
apples
in
the
yellow
bowl
that
rested
on
her
broad
hip
rose
had
also
studied
her
son
for
a
few
awed
seconds
and
then
reminding
her
mother
that
it
was
past
twelve
had
led
the
way
toward
and
the
general
heating
and
toasting
and
mincing
of
odds
and
ends
for
luncheon
and
they
had
been
in
the
kitchen
talking
over
the
last
scraps
of
this
meal
when
when
there
had
been
laughter
and
voices
at
the
open
front
doorway
and
when
sheridan
startled
wolf
had
been
followed
by
surprised
norma
then
they
had
come
in
wolf
and
norma
laughing
and
excited
and
bubbling
with
their
great
news
and
in
joy
and
tears
confused
interruptions
and
exclamations
explanations
that
got
nowhere
and
a
plentiful
distribution
of
kisses
somehow
it
got
itself
told
they
had
been
married
an
hour
ago
norma
was
wolf
wife
the
girl
was
radiant
never
in
her
life
had
these
three
who
loved
her
seen
her
so
beautiful
so
enchantingly
confident
and
gay
rose
and
her
mother
had
some
little
trouble
later
on
in
patching
the
sequence
of
events
together
for
the
delighted
but
bewildered
harry
rose
husband
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
even
to
the
shrewd
eyes
of
her
aunt
kate
that
norma
was
ecstatically
happy
her
mad
kisses
for
rose
the
laughter
with
which
she
described
the
expedition
to
bank
and
jeweller
the
license
bureau
and
the
church
in
jersey
city
for
in
order
to
have
the
ceremony
performed
immediately
it
had
been
necessary
to
be
married
in
new
jersey
her
delicious
boldness
toward
the
awed
and
rapturous
and
almost
stupefied
wolf
were
all
proof
that
she
entertained
not
even
the
usual
girlish
misgivings
of
the
wedding
day
you
see
i
not
been
all
tired
out
with
trousseau
and
engagement
affairs
and
photographers
and
milliners
and
all
that
she
explained
gaily
i
only
got
what
in
my
bag
there
but
i
wired
aunt
marianna
and
told
her
to
tell
them
all
and
we
be
back
on
monday
wait
until
i
ask
my
husband
wolftone
dear
shall
we
be
back
on
monday
she
had
the
baby
in
her
lap
they
were
all
in
the
rose
had
been
assured
that
the
bride
and
groom
were
not
hungry
they
had
had
sandwiches
somewhere
some
time
oh
down
near
the
city
hall
in
jersey
city
but
rose
had
made
more
tea
and
more
toast
and
she
had
opened
her
own
best
plum
jam
and
they
were
all
eating
with
the
heartiness
of
children
presently
norma
went
to
get
in
aunt
kate
lap
and
asked
her
if
she
was
glad
and
made
herself
so
generally
engaging
and
endearing
with
her
slender
little
body
clasped
in
the
big
motherly
arms
and
her
soft
face
resting
against
the
older
face
that
wolf
did
not
dare
to
look
at
her
they
were
going
to
atlantic
city
neither
had
ever
been
there
and
if
this
warm
weather
lasted
it
would
be
lovely
even
in
early
spring
it
was
almost
four
when
the
younger
women
went
upstairs
for
the
freshening
touches
that
norma
declared
she
needed
and
then
wolf
and
his
mother
were
left
alone
he
knelt
down
beside
the
big
rocker
in
which
she
was
ensconced
with
the
baby
and
she
put
one
arm
about
him
and
kissed
the
big
thick
crest
of
his
brown
hair
you
glad
are
you
mother
glad
i
prayed
for
it
ever
since
she
came
to
me
years
ago
sheridan
answered
but
after
a
moment
she
added
gravely
she
pure
gold
our
norma
they
sickened
her
just
as
i
knew
they
would
but
wolf
she
may
swing
back
for
a
little
while
she
like
that
she
always
has
been
she
was
no
more
than
a
baby
when
she
be
as
naughty
as
she
could
be
and
then
so
good
that
i
was
afraid
i
was
going
to
lose
her
go
gently
with
her
wolf
be
patient
with
her
dear
she
going
to
make
a
magnificent
woman
some
day
she
a
magnificent
woman
now
the
man
said
simply
she
too
good
for
me
i
know
that
she
you
ca
think
how
cunning
she
is
how
wonderful
she
been
all
day
go
slowly
his
mother
said
again
she
only
a
baby
wolf
excited
and
romantic
and
generous
because
she
such
a
baby
do
make
her
sorry
that
she
given
herself
to
you
so
so
trusting
she
hesitated
i
take
care
of
her
wolf
asserted
a
little
gruffly
there
was
time
for
no
more
they
heard
her
step
on
the
stairs
and
she
came
dancing
back
with
rose
her
cheeks
were
burning
with
excitement
she
gave
her
aunt
and
cousin
quick
kisses
and
caught
the
baby
soft
little
cheek
to
her
own
velvety
one
she
and
wolf
would
be
back
on
sunday
night
they
promised
as
they
ran
down
the
path
the
sun
slipped
behind
a
leaden
cloud
and
all
the
world
darkened
suddenly
a
brisk
whirl
of
springtime
wind
shook
the
rose
bushes
in
rose
little
garden
and
there
was
a
cool
rushing
in
the
air
that
promised
rain
but
norma
was
still
carried
along
on
the
high
tide
of
supreme
emotion
and
to
wolf
the
day
was
radiant
with
unearthly
sunshine
and
perfumed
with
all
the
flowers
of
spring
the
girl
had
flung
herself
so
wholeheartedly
into
her
rôle
that
it
was
not
enough
to
bewilder
and
please
wolf
she
must
make
him
utterly
happy
dear
old
wolf
always
ready
to
protect
her
always
good
and
big
and
affectionate
and
ready
to
laugh
at
her
silliest
jokes
and
ready
to
meet
any
of
her
problems
sympathetically
and
generously
her
beauty
her
irresistible
charm
as
she
hung
on
his
arm
and
chattered
of
what
they
would
do
when
they
started
housekeeping
almost
dizzied
him
she
liked
everything
their
wheeling
deep
upholstered
seats
in
the
train
the
seaside
hotel
with
the
sea
rolling
so
near
in
the
soft
twilight
the
dinner
for
which
they
found
themselves
so
hungry
afterward
they
climbed
laughing
into
a
big
chair
and
were
pushed
along
between
the
moving
lines
of
other
chairs
far
up
the
long
boardwalk
and
norma
with
her
soft
loose
glove
in
wolf
big
hand
leaned
back
against
the
curved
wicker
seat
and
looked
at
the
little
lighted
shops
and
listened
to
the
scrape
of
feet
and
chatter
of
tongues
and
the
solemn
roll
and
crash
of
the
waves
and
stared
up
childishly
at
the
arch
of
stars
that
looked
so
far
and
calm
above
this
petty
noise
and
glare
she
was
very
tired
every
muscle
in
her
body
ached
but
she
was
content
wolf
was
taking
care
of
her
and
there
would
be
no
more
lonely
vigils
and
agonies
of
indecision
and
pain
she
thought
of
christopher
with
a
sort
of
childish
quiet
triumph
she
had
solved
the
whole
matter
for
them
both
superbly
wolf
was
a
silent
man
with
persons
he
did
not
know
but
he
never
was
silent
with
norma
he
always
had
a
thousand
things
to
discuss
with
her
the
lights
and
the
stir
on
the
boardwalk
inspired
him
to
all
sorts
of
criticism
and
speculation
and
they
estimated
just
the
expense
and
waste
that
went
on
there
day
by
day
really
to
have
the
ocean
wolf
it
would
be
so
much
nicer
to
be
even
in
the
wildest
place
just
rocks
and
coves
this
is
like
having
a
lion
in
your
front
parlour
lord
norma
when
i
got
up
this
morning
if
somebody
had
told
me
that
i
would
be
married
and
down
at
atlantic
city
i
know
it
like
a
dream
but
you
not
sorry
norma
you
sure
that
i
going
to
make
you
happy
the
man
asked
in
sudden
anxiety
you
always
wolf
she
answered
very
simply
he
never
really
doubted
it
it
was
a
part
of
wolf
healthy
normal
nature
to
believe
what
was
good
and
loving
he
was
not
exacting
not
envious
he
had
no
real
understanding
of
her
giddy
old
desires
for
wealth
and
social
power
wolf
at
was
working
so
hard
and
so
interestedly
sleeping
so
deeply
eating
his
meals
with
such
appetite
and
enjoying
his
rare
idle
time
so
heartily
that
he
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
for
vagaries
he
had
always
been
older
than
his
years
schooled
to
feel
that
just
good
meals
and
a
sure
roof
above
him
marked
him
as
one
of
the
fortunate
ones
of
the
earth
and
of
late
his
work
in
the
big
factory
had
been
responsible
enough
absorbing
enough
and
more
than
gratifying
enough
to
satisfy
him
with
his
prospects
he
was
liked
for
himself
and
he
knew
it
and
he
was
already
known
for
that
strange
that
odd
little
twist
of
mechanical
vision
that
sure
knowledge
of
himself
and
his
medium
that
is
genius
the
joy
of
finding
himself
and
that
the
world
needed
him
had
been
strong
upon
wolf
during
the
last
few
months
and
that
norma
had
come
back
to
him
seemed
only
a
reason
for
fresh
dedication
to
his
work
an
augury
that
life
was
going
to
be
kind
to
him
she
was
gone
when
he
wakened
the
next
morning
but
he
knew
that
the
sea
had
an
irresistible
fascination
for
her
and
followed
her
quite
as
surely
as
if
she
had
left
footprints
on
the
clear
and
empty
sands
he
found
her
with
her
back
propped
against
a
low
wooden
bulkhead
her
slender
ankles
crossed
before
her
her
blue
eyes
fixed
far
out
at
sea
she
turned
and
looked
up
at
him
from
under
the
brim
of
her
hat
and
the
man
heart
turned
almost
sick
with
the
depth
of
sudden
adoration
that
shook
him
so
young
so
friendly
and
simple
and
trusting
was
the
ready
smile
so
infinitely
endearing
the
touch
of
the
warm
fingers
she
slipped
into
his
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
they
dug
their
heels
into
the
sand
and
talked
in
low
tones
the
sun
shone
down
on
them
kindly
and
the
waves
curved
and
broke
and
came
rushing
and
slithering
to
their
feet
and
slid
churning
and
foaming
noisily
under
the
pier
near
by
norma
buried
her
husband
big
hand
in
sand
and
sifted
sand
through
her
slender
fingers
sometimes
she
looked
with
her
look
far
out
across
the
gently
rocking
ocean
and
sometimes
she
brought
her
blue
eyes
gravely
to
his
and
the
new
seriousness
in
them
the
grave
and
noble
sweetness
that
he
read
there
made
wolf
suddenly
feel
himself
no
longer
a
boy
no
longer
free
but
bound
for
ever
to
this
exquisite
and
bewildering
child
who
was
a
woman
or
woman
who
was
a
child
sacredly
bound
to
give
her
the
best
that
there
was
in
him
of
love
and
service
and
protection
she
showed
him
a
new
norma
here
on
the
sunshiny
sands
one
that
he
was
to
know
better
as
the
days
went
by
she
had
always
deferred
to
his
wisdom
and
his
understanding
but
she
seemed
to
him
mysteriously
wise
this
morning
no
longer
the
old
little
sister
norma
but
a
new
sage
woman
toward
whom
his
whole
being
was
flooded
with
humility
and
awe
and
utter
speechless
adoration
at
nine
when
nurses
and
children
began
to
come
down
to
the
shore
they
got
to
their
feet
and
wandered
in
to
breakfast
and
here
to
his
delight
she
was
suddenly
the
old
norma
again
healthily
eager
for
ham
and
eggs
and
hot
coffee
interested
in
everything
and
bewitchingly
pretty
in
whatever
position
she
took
i
wish
we
had
the
old
nono
wolf
said
he
usually
spoke
of
his
by
this
name
they
been
overhauling
her
in
that
newark
place
she
was
to
be
ready
by
george
she
was
ready
yesterday
we
go
over
i
come
over
and
meet
you
next
saturday
his
young
wife
promised
busy
with
rolls
and
marmalade
and
you
take
me
to
lunch
and
then
we
get
the
car
and
go
and
take
rose
and
the
baby
for
a
ride
norma
the
man
exclaimed
suddenly
struck
with
a
sense
of
utter
felicity
and
leaning
across
the
table
to
stop
for
the
minute
her
moving
fingers
with
the
pressure
of
his
own
you
have
any
idea
how
much
i
love
you
i
did
know
myself
what
it
was
going
to
mean
to
have
you
come
over
to
the
factory
and
to
have
somebody
say
that
sheridan
is
there
and
to
go
to
lunch
dearest
do
you
realize
how
wonderful
and
how
well
how
it
going
to
be
norma
i
ca
believe
it
i
ca
believe
that
this
is
what
love
means
to
everybody
i
ca
believe
that
every
man
who
marries
his
his
girl
she
supplied
laughing
girl
but
i
did
mean
girl
i
meant
his
ideal
the
loveliest
person
he
ever
knew
wolf
said
with
a
new
quickness
of
tongue
that
she
knew
was
born
of
happiness
i
ca
believe
that
just
going
to
restaurants
or
taking
the
car
out
on
sunday
or
any
other
fool
thing
we
do
means
to
any
man
what
it
going
to
mean
to
me
i
just
well
i
told
you
that
i
just
ca
believe
it
two
days
later
they
came
home
for
sunday
supper
and
there
was
much
simple
joy
and
laughter
in
the
little
city
apartment
aunt
kate
of
course
had
fried
chicken
and
coffee
for
her
four
big
children
harry
junior
awakening
was
brought
dewy
and
blinking
to
the
table
where
his
aunt
norma
kissed
the
tears
from
his
warm
round
little
cheeks
and
gave
him
crumbs
of
sponge
cake
rose
and
harry
left
at
ten
for
their
country
home
leaving
the
precious
baby
for
his
grandmother
and
aunt
to
bring
back
the
next
day
but
the
other
three
sat
talking
and
planning
until
almost
midnight
and
kate
could
feast
her
eyes
to
her
heart
content
upon
the
picture
of
wolf
in
his
father
old
leather
chair
with
norma
perched
on
the
wide
arm
one
of
her
own
arms
about
her
husband
neck
and
their
fingers
locked
together
it
was
settled
that
they
were
to
find
a
little
house
in
east
orange
near
rose
and
furnish
it
from
top
to
bottom
and
go
to
housekeeping
immediately
meanwhile
norma
must
see
the
melroses
and
get
her
wedding
announcements
engraved
and
order
some
new
calling
cards
and
do
a
thousand
things
she
and
wolf
must
spend
their
evenings
writing
notes
and
presents
would
be
arriving
she
made
infinitesimal
lists
and
put
them
into
her
shopping
bag
or
stuck
them
in
her
mirror
but
wolf
laughed
at
them
all
and
instead
of
disposing
of
them
they
developed
a
demoralizing
habit
of
wandering
out
into
broadway
in
their
old
fashion
after
dinner
looking
into
shop
windows
drifting
into
little
theatres
talking
to
beggars
and
men
and
policemen
and
strangers
generally
mingling
with
the
bubbling
young
life
of
the
city
that
overflowed
the
sidewalks
and
surged
in
and
out
of
candy
and
drug
stores
and
sat
talking
on
park
benches
deep
into
the
soft
young
summer
nights
sometimes
they
went
down
to
the
shrill
and
crowded
streets
of
the
lower
east
side
and
philosophized
youthfully
over
what
they
saw
there
and
as
the
nights
grew
heavier
and
warmer
they
often
took
the
car
and
skimmed
out
into
the
heavenly
green
open
spaces
of
the
park
or
on
saturday
afternoon
packed
their
supper
and
carried
it
fifty
miles
away
to
the
woods
or
the
shore
chapter
xxv
before
she
had
been
married
ten
days
norma
dutifully
went
to
call
upon
old
melrose
being
fortunate
enough
to
find
leslie
there
the
old
lady
came
toward
norma
with
her
soft
old
wavering
footsteps
and
gave
the
girl
a
warm
kiss
even
with
her
initial
rebuke
well
i
do
know
whether
i
am
speaking
to
this
bad
runaway
or
not
she
quavered
releasing
norma
from
her
bejewelled
and
embrace
and
shaking
her
fluffed
and
scanty
gray
hair
oh
yes
you
are
aunt
marianna
the
girl
said
confidently
with
her
happy
laugh
leslie
coming
more
slowly
forward
laughed
and
kissed
her
too
but
why
did
you
tell
us
norma
and
have
a
regular
wedding
like
mine
she
protested
i
did
know
that
you
and
your
cousin
were
even
engaged
we
worked
it
out
that
we
were
engaged
for
exactly
three
hours
and
ten
minutes
norma
said
as
they
all
settled
down
in
the
magnificent
ugly
comfortable
old
for
tea
she
could
see
that
both
leslie
and
her
grandmother
were
far
from
displeased
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
old
lady
was
secretly
delighted
the
girl
was
most
suitably
and
happily
and
satisfactorily
married
justice
had
been
done
her
and
she
had
solved
her
own
problem
splendidly
but
you
knew
he
liked
you
leslie
ventured
diverted
and
curious
oh
well
norma
lips
puckered
mischievously
and
she
looked
down
oh
you
engaged
leslie
said
incredulously
he
handsome
is
he
norma
yes
the
wife
admitted
as
if
casually
he
really
is
at
least
i
think
so
and
i
think
everyone
else
thinks
so
at
least
when
i
compare
him
to
the
other
men
for
instance
oh
norma
i
bet
you
crazy
about
him
leslie
said
derisively
norma
looked
appealingly
at
the
old
lady
her
eyes
dancing
with
fun
well
of
she
loves
her
husband
melrose
protested
with
a
little
cushiony
pat
of
her
hand
for
the
visitor
i
do
see
that
it
course
leslie
argued
airily
with
a
little
bitterness
in
her
tone
her
grandmother
looked
at
her
in
quick
reproof
and
anxiety
the
latest
she
said
drily
to
norma
is
that
my
delightful
husband
is
living
at
his
club
now
leslie
that
is
very
naughty
the
old
lady
said
warmly
you
should
talk
so
of
acton
well
leslie
countered
with
elaborate
innocence
turning
to
norma
all
i
can
say
is
that
he
walked
out
one
night
and
did
come
back
until
the
next
of
course
she
added
with
a
suppressed
yawn
that
poorly
concealed
her
sudden
inclination
to
tears
of
course
care
patsy
and
i
are
going
up
to
glen
cove
next
week
and
he
can
live
at
his
club
for
all
me
money
norma
asked
for
leslie
extravagance
was
usually
the
cause
of
the
young
liggetts
domestic
strife
leslie
who
had
lighted
a
cigarette
made
an
affirmative
grimace
now
it
all
been
settled
and
grandma
has
straightened
it
all
out
old
melrose
said
soothingly
acton
was
making
out
their
income
tax
she
explained
and
some
money
was
mentioned
how
was
that
dear
leslie
had
sold
something
and
he
had
known
of
it
that
was
all
of
course
he
was
a
little
cross
poor
boy
he
had
worked
it
all
out
one
way
and
he
had
no
idea
that
this
extra
sixteen
thousand
was
it
had
come
in
at
all
and
been
spent
most
of
it
for
bills
leslie
interpolated
bitterly
norma
laughed
sixteen
thou
oh
heavens
my
husband
salary
is
sixty
dollars
a
week
she
confessed
gaily
but
you
have
your
own
money
the
old
lady
reminded
her
kindly
and
a
very
nice
thing
for
a
wife
too
i
talked
to
judge
lee
about
it
dear
and
it
all
arranged
you
must
let
me
do
this
norma
i
think
you
awfully
good
to
me
aunt
marianna
norma
said
thoughtfully
i
told
wolf
about
it
and
he
thinks
so
too
but
honestly
even
with
her
secret
knowledge
of
her
own
parentage
norma
was
surprised
at
the
fluttered
anxiety
of
the
old
lady
and
leslie
was
frankly
puzzled
no
norma
no
norma
melrose
said
nervously
and
imploringly
i
do
want
you
to
discuss
that
at
all
it
the
check
is
to
be
deposited
every
month
or
quarter
or
whatever
it
was
do
be
a
fool
norma
you
need
it
one
way
or
another
leslie
assured
her
but
in
her
own
heart
leslie
wondered
at
her
generosity
everybody
needs
more
money
i
bet
you
the
king
of
england
oh
kings
norma
laughed
they
the
worst
of
all
i
do
know
about
this
one
but
they
always
appealing
for
special
funds
all
of
them
and
that
one
thing
that
makes
wolf
so
mad
the
fact
that
all
they
have
to
do
for
ridiculous
extravagances
is
clap
on
a
tax
but
leslie
and
her
grandmother
were
not
interested
in
the
young
engineer
economic
theories
the
old
lady
followed
norma
spirited
summary
merely
with
an
uneasy
you
must
let
your
husband
get
any
socialistic
ideas
norma
there
too
much
of
that
now
and
leslie
after
a
close
study
of
norma
glowing
face
remarked
suddenly
norma
i
bet
you
a
you
rouged
before
she
left
the
visitor
managed
a
casual
inquiry
about
aunt
alice
aunt
alice
was
fine
leslie
answered
carelessly
adding
immediately
that
no
aunt
alice
really
was
extremely
well
doctor
garrett
did
want
her
to
go
away
this
summer
thought
that
move
was
an
unnecessary
waste
of
energy
since
aunt
alice
house
was
so
cool
and
she
felt
the
heat
so
little
and
chris
said
that
alice
had
always
really
wanted
to
stay
in
town
in
her
own
comfortable
suite
she
liked
her
second
nurse
immensely
and
miss
slater
was
really
running
the
house
now
the
third
nurse
coming
only
at
night
but
aunt
alice
never
had
a
nurse
at
night
norma
was
going
to
say
but
she
caught
the
stricken
and
apprehensive
look
on
the
old
lady
face
and
substituted
generously
well
i
remember
aunt
alice
told
me
she
had
one
of
these
wretched
times
several
years
ago
yes
indeed
she
did
frightened
us
almost
to
death
melrose
agreed
thankfully
and
how
is
how
is
chris
norma
felt
proud
of
the
natural
tone
in
which
she
could
ask
the
question
chris
is
fine
leslie
answered
she
rarely
varied
the
phrase
in
this
relation
he
hunting
in
canada
he
had
a
wire
from
some
man
there
and
he
went
off
about
a
week
ago
they
going
after
moose
i
believe
chris
did
expect
to
get
back
for
a
month
aunt
alice
was
delighted
because
she
hates
to
keep
him
in
town
all
summer
but
acton
told
me
that
he
thought
chris
was
sick
that
he
and
judge
lee
just
made
him
go
well
her
heart
would
flutter
she
could
not
stop
it
or
ignore
it
norma
found
no
answer
ready
and
though
she
lifted
her
cup
to
her
lips
to
hide
her
confusion
she
could
not
taste
it
the
strangeness
of
sudden
departure
was
no
mystery
to
her
he
had
been
shocked
and
stunned
by
her
marriage
and
he
had
run
away
from
the
eyes
that
might
have
pierced
his
discomfiture
still
her
hands
were
trembling
and
she
felt
oddly
shaken
and
confused
leslie
carried
the
conversation
away
to
safer
fields
and
shortly
afterward
norma
could
say
her
everybody
leslie
said
walking
with
her
to
the
corner
wanted
to
know
what
the
bride
wanted
for
a
norma
told
wolf
over
their
supper
table
an
hour
or
two
later
that
he
and
she
would
be
bankrupted
for
life
returning
them
yet
she
loved
the
excitement
of
receiving
the
gifts
naturally
enough
loved
rose
ecstasies
over
the
rugs
and
silver
and
mahogany
that
made
the
little
new
jersey
house
a
jewel
among
its
kind
it
was
what
norma
had
unhesitatingly
pronounced
an
adorable
house
a
copy
of
the
true
colonial
quaint
and
prim
enough
to
please
even
leslie
when
leslie
duly
came
to
call
it
stood
at
the
end
of
a
street
with
the
rising
woods
behind
it
and
norma
recklessly
invested
in
brick
walks
and
a
latticed
green
fence
hydrangeas
in
wooden
tubs
and
sunflowers
and
hollyhocks
until
her
stretch
of
side
garden
looked
like
a
picture
by
kate
greenaway
when
it
was
all
done
midsummer
was
upon
them
but
she
and
wolf
thought
that
there
had
never
been
anything
so
complete
and
so
charming
in
all
the
world
the
striped
awnings
that
threw
clean
shadows
upon
the
clipped
grass
the
tea
table
under
the
leaves
of
an
old
apple
tree
the
glass
doors
that
opened
upon
orderly
rooms
full
of
shining
dark
surfaces
and
flowered
chintzes
and
gleaming
glass
bowls
of
real
flowers
the
smallness
and
completeness
and
prettiness
of
everything
filled
them
both
with
utter
satisfaction
norma
played
at
housekeeping
like
a
little
girl
in
a
doll
house
she
had
a
rosy
little
finnish
maid
who
enjoyed
it
all
almost
as
much
as
she
did
and
their
adventures
in
hospitality
were
a
constant
amusement
and
delight
on
saturdays
when
rose
and
harry
and
aunt
kate
usually
arrived
wolf
could
hardly
believe
that
all
this
ideal
beauty
and
pleasure
was
his
to
share
the
girls
would
pose
and
photograph
the
baby
tirelessly
laughing
as
he
toppled
and
protested
and
kissing
the
fat
legs
that
showed
between
his
pink
romper
and
his
pink
socks
they
would
pack
picnic
lunches
rushing
to
and
fro
breathlessly
with
thermos
bottles
and
extra
wraps
for
miggs
as
harry
junior
was
usually
called
once
or
twice
they
cleaned
the
car
with
tremendous
splashing
and
spattering
assuming
wolf
old
overalls
for
the
operation
and
retreating
with
shrieks
into
the
kitchen
whenever
the
sound
of
an
approaching
penetrated
into
their
quiet
road
sheridan
characterized
them
variously
as
wild
indians
and
poor
innocents
but
her
heart
was
so
filled
with
joy
and
gratitude
for
the
turn
of
events
that
had
brought
all
these
miracles
about
that
no
nonsense
and
no
noise
seemed
to
her
really
extravagant
it
was
an
exceptionally
pleasant
community
into
which
the
young
sheridans
had
chanced
to
move
and
they
might
have
had
much
more
neighbourly
life
than
they
chose
to
take
there
were
about
them
beginners
of
all
sorts
writers
and
artists
and
newspaper
men
whose
little
cars
and
little
maids
and
great
ambitions
would
have
formed
a
strong
bond
of
sympathy
in
time
but
wolf
and
norma
saw
them
only
occasionally
when
a
sunday
supper
at
the
country
club
or
a
dance
supplied
them
with
a
pleasant
stimulating
sense
of
being
liked
and
welcomed
or
when
general
greetings
on
the
train
in
the
morning
were
mingled
with
comments
on
the
thunderstorm
or
the
epidemic
of
nursery
when
rose
and
harry
were
gone
on
sunday
evenings
wolf
and
norma
might
sit
on
the
side
steps
of
the
side
porch
looking
off
across
the
gradual
drop
descent
of
and
shingled
roofs
into
a
distant
world
silvering
under
the
summer
moon
these
were
their
happiest
times
when
solitude
and
quiet
spread
about
them
after
the
hospitable
excitements
of
the
day
and
they
could
talk
and
dream
and
plan
for
the
years
ahead
she
was
an
older
norma
now
even
though
marriage
had
not
touched
her
with
any
real
responsibility
and
even
though
she
was
more
full
of
delicious
childish
absurdities
than
ever
the
first
months
of
their
marriage
had
curiously
reversed
their
relationship
and
it
was
norma
now
who
gave
and
wolf
who
humbly
and
gratefully
accepted
it
was
norma
who
poured
comfort
and
beauty
and
companionship
into
his
life
who
smiled
at
him
over
his
morning
fruit
and
who
waited
for
him
under
the
old
maple
at
the
turn
of
the
road
every
night
and
as
her
wonderful
and
touching
generosity
enveloped
him
and
her
strange
wisdom
and
new
sweetness
impressed
him
more
and
more
wolf
marvelled
and
adored
her
more
utterly
he
had
always
loved
her
as
a
big
brother
had
even
experienced
a
definite
heartache
when
she
grew
up
and
went
away
a
lovely
and
unattainable
girl
in
the
place
where
their
old
giddy
dear
little
norma
had
been
but
now
his
passion
for
his
young
wife
was
becoming
a
devouring
fire
in
wolf
heart
she
absorbed
him
and
possessed
him
like
a
madness
a
dozen
times
a
day
he
would
take
from
his
the
thin
leather
case
she
had
given
him
holding
on
one
side
a
photograph
of
the
three
heads
of
rose
his
mother
and
the
baby
and
on
the
other
an
enchanting
shadow
of
the
loosened
soft
hair
and
the
serious
profile
that
was
norma
and
as
he
stood
looking
at
it
with
the
machinery
roaring
about
him
and
the
sunlight
beating
in
through
windows
sixty
feet
high
in
all
the
confusion
of
shavings
and
wood
polished
sliding
shafts
streaked
with
thick
blue
grease
stifling
odours
of
creosote
and
oily
wipes
wolf
eyes
would
fill
with
tears
and
he
would
shake
his
head
at
his
own
emotion
and
try
to
laugh
it
away
after
awhile
he
took
another
little
picture
of
her
this
one
taken
under
a
taut
parasol
in
bright
sunlight
and
fitted
it
over
the
opposite
faces
and
then
when
he
had
studied
one
picture
he
could
turn
to
the
other
and
perhaps
go
back
to
the
first
before
his
eyes
were
satisfied
and
if
during
the
day
some
thought
brought
her
suddenly
to
mind
he
would
stop
short
in
whatever
he
was
doing
and
remember
her
little
timid
upglancing
look
as
she
hazarded
at
breakfast
some
question
about
his
work
or
remember
her
enthusiasm
on
a
country
tramp
for
the
chance
meal
at
some
wayside
restaurant
and
sheer
love
of
her
would
overwhelm
him
and
he
would
find
his
eyes
brimming
again
chapter
xxvi
so
the
summer
fled
and
before
she
fairly
realized
it
norma
saw
the
leaves
colouring
behind
the
little
house
like
a
wall
of
fire
and
rustled
them
with
her
feet
when
she
tramped
with
wolf
big
collie
into
the
woods
the
air
grew
clearer
and
thinner
sunset
came
too
soon
and
a
delicate
beading
of
dew
loitered
on
the
shady
side
of
the
house
until
almost
noon
one
october
day
when
she
had
been
six
months
a
wife
norma
made
her
first
call
upon
annie
von
behrens
alice
she
had
seen
several
times
when
she
had
stopped
in
late
in
the
summer
mornings
to
entertain
the
invalid
with
her
first
adventures
in
housekeeping
and
chat
with
miss
slater
but
chris
she
had
quite
deliberately
avoided
he
had
written
her
from
canada
a
brief
and
charming
note
which
she
had
shown
wolf
and
he
and
alice
had
had
their
share
in
the
general
family
gift
of
silver
the
crates
and
bags
and
boxes
of
spoons
and
bowls
and
teapots
that
had
anticipated
every
possible
table
need
of
the
sheridans
for
generations
to
come
but
that
was
all
she
had
not
seen
chris
and
did
not
want
to
see
him
the
whole
thing
is
rather
like
a
sickness
in
my
mind
she
told
wolf
and
i
do
want
to
see
him
any
more
than
you
would
a
doctor
or
a
nurse
that
was
associated
with
illness
i
do
know
what
we
what
i
was
thinking
about
but
you
think
he
really
loved
you
nono
well
or
he
thought
he
did
and
did
you
like
him
terribly
i
think
i
thought
i
did
too
it
was
of
course
it
was
something
we
could
very
well
discuss
well
i
sorry
for
him
wolf
had
dismissed
him
easily
on
her
part
norma
was
conscious
of
no
particular
emotion
when
she
thought
of
chris
the
suddenness
and
violence
with
which
she
had
broken
that
association
and
made
its
resumption
for
ever
impossible
had
carried
her
safely
into
a
totally
different
life
her
marriage
her
new
husband
and
new
home
her
new
title
indeed
made
her
seem
another
woman
and
if
she
thought
of
chris
at
all
it
was
to
imagine
what
he
would
think
of
these
changes
and
to
fancy
what
he
would
say
of
them
when
they
met
no
purely
visionary
meeting
can
hold
the
element
of
passion
and
so
it
was
a
remote
and
spiritualized
chris
of
whom
norma
came
to
think
far
removed
from
the
actual
man
of
flesh
and
blood
her
call
upon
annie
she
made
with
a
mental
reserve
of
cheerful
explanation
and
apology
ready
for
annie
first
reproach
norma
never
could
quite
forget
the
extraordinary
relationship
in
which
she
stood
to
annie
and
perhaps
half
consciously
was
influenced
by
the
belief
that
some
day
the
brilliant
and
wonderful
von
behrens
would
come
to
know
of
it
too
but
annie
who
happened
to
be
at
home
and
had
other
callers
rapidly
dashed
norma
vague
and
romantic
anticipations
by
showing
her
only
the
brisk
and
aloof
cordiality
with
which
she
held
at
bay
nine
tenths
of
her
acquaintance
annie
old
butler
showed
norma
impassively
to
the
little
that
was
tucked
in
beyond
the
big
one
two
or
three
strangers
eyed
the
newcomer
cautiously
and
annie
merely
accorded
her
a
perfunctory
welcome
they
were
having
tea
well
how
do
you
do
how
very
nice
of
you
norma
do
you
know
theodore
thayer
and
thayer
and
miss
bishop
katrina
this
is
the
name
is
still
sheridan
is
it
norma
this
is
sheridan
who
was
with
mama
and
leslie
last
summer
you
have
lots
of
sugar
and
cream
norma
of
course
all
youngsters
do
and
you
near
the
toast
and
annie
dismissing
her
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
dropped
her
voice
to
the
undertone
that
norma
had
evidently
interrupted
do
go
on
leila
she
said
to
the
older
of
the
three
women
that
quite
delicious
i
heard
something
of
it
but
i
knew
of
course
that
there
was
more
a
highly
flavoured
little
scandal
was
in
process
of
construction
norma
knew
the
principals
slightly
the
divorced
woman
and
the
second
husband
from
whom
she
had
borrowed
money
to
loan
the
first
she
could
join
in
the
laughter
that
broke
out
presently
while
she
tried
to
identify
her
companions
the
younger
thayer
had
been
the
miss
katrina
davenport
of
last
month
brilliant
wedding
pictures
of
her
had
filled
the
illustrated
weeklies
and
all
the
world
knew
that
she
and
her
husband
were
preparing
to
leave
for
a
wonderful
home
in
hawaii
where
the
family
sugar
interests
were
based
they
were
to
cross
the
continent
norma
knew
in
the
davenport
private
car
to
be
elaborately
entertained
in
san
francisco
and
to
be
prominent
naturally
in
the
island
set
little
miss
bishop
had
just
announced
her
engagement
to
lord
donnyfare
a
splendid
big
clumsy
and
impecunious
young
briton
who
had
made
himself
very
popular
with
the
younger
group
this
winter
they
were
to
be
married
in
january
and
her
ladyship
would
shortly
afterward
be
transferred
to
london
society
presented
at
court
and
placed
as
mistress
over
the
old
family
acres
in
devonshire
they
were
both
nice
girls
pretty
beautifully
groomed
and
dressed
and
far
from
unintelligent
as
they
discussed
their
plans
how
their
favourite
horses
and
dogs
would
be
moved
and
what
instructions
had
been
given
the
maids
who
had
preceded
them
to
their
respective
homes
katrina
thayer
was
just
twenty
mary
bishop
a
year
younger
norma
knew
that
the
former
was
perhaps
the
richest
girl
in
america
and
the
latter
was
also
an
heiress
the
society
papers
having
already
hinted
that
among
the
wedding
gifts
shortly
to
be
displayed
would
be
an
uncle
casual
check
for
one
million
dollars
and
of
course
it
be
charming
for
chris
mary
annie
presently
said
if
he
really
sent
to
saint
james
norma
felt
her
throat
thicken
chris
to
england
as
ambassador
she
said
well
there
just
a
possibility
no
there
more
than
that
annie
told
her
i
believe
he
take
it
if
it
is
offered
of
course
supremely
well
fitted
for
it
there
even
annie
threw
out
to
the
company
at
large
with
that
air
of
being
specially
informed
in
which
she
delighted
there
even
very
good
reason
to
suppose
that
influence
has
been
brought
to
bear
by
but
i
do
dare
go
into
that
however
we
feel
that
it
will
be
offered
and
the
one
serious
drawback
is
naturally
my
sister
alice
poor
child
and
yet
of
us
all
alice
is
most
desperately
eager
for
chris
to
take
it
i
should
think
norma
said
that
aunt
alice
could
almost
be
moved
oh
she
would
be
annie
agreed
with
her
quick
superior
definiteness
that
the
very
question
whether
the
north
atlantic
passage
say
in
may
when
it
ought
to
be
so
hard
would
be
too
much
for
her
of
course
it
would
tire
her
and
shake
her
cruelly
no
doubt
of
that
but
hendrick
even
talks
of
some
sort
of
balanced
bed
on
the
hammock
idea
and
miss
slater
would
see
that
everything
that
was
humanly
possible
was
done
i
believe
it
could
be
managed
then
she
would
be
met
by
one
of
those
big
comfortable
english
ambulances
at
southampton
and
taken
right
to
her
apartment
or
hotel
or
whatever
chris
arranges
not
so
much
harder
norma
ventured
than
the
trip
to
newport
after
all
well
she
did
go
to
newport
last
summer
annie
said
but
she
is
certainly
better
now
than
she
was
then
and
i
believe
it
could
be
done
i
really
do
we
not
talking
a
great
deal
about
it
because
nothing
is
settled
but
if
it
becomes
definite
i
shall
certainly
advise
it
norma
drank
her
tea
and
listened
and
threw
in
an
occasional
word
when
the
other
women
rose
to
go
she
rose
too
perhaps
that
annie
would
hold
her
for
a
more
intimate
word
but
annie
quite
suavely
and
indifferently
included
her
in
her
general
farewells
and
norma
had
cordial
from
the
two
young
women
and
even
a
vague
invitation
from
the
older
thayer
to
come
and
see
her
when
katrina
was
gone
then
she
was
walking
down
the
avenue
with
her
head
and
heart
in
a
confused
whirl
of
bitterness
and
disappointment
the
three
quarters
of
an
hour
in
aunt
annie
big
dim
luxurious
palace
had
been
like
a
dose
of
some
insidious
poison
the
very
atmosphere
of
richness
and
service
and
idleness
the
beauty
of
wide
spaces
and
rich
tones
the
massed
blossoms
and
dimmed
lights
struck
sharply
upon
senses
attuned
to
aunt
kate
quick
voice
little
house
with
its
poverty
and
utility
and
wolf
frank
enjoyment
of
his
late
and
simple
dinner
the
conversation
with
its
pleasant
assumption
of
untold
wealth
of
power
and
travel
and
regal
luxuriousness
burned
its
memory
across
norma
mind
like
a
corroding
acid
they
were
not
contemptible
they
were
not
robbers
or
brutes
or
hideous
old
plutocrats
who
had
grown
wealthy
upon
the
wrongs
of
the
poor
no
they
were
normal
pleasant
girls
whose
code
it
was
to
be
generous
to
maids
and
underlings
to
speak
well
of
their
neighbours
to
pay
their
bills
and
keep
their
promises
they
make
me
she
tried
to
tell
herself
walking
briskly
and
filling
her
lungs
with
the
sweet
fresh
air
it
was
twilight
and
the
tide
of
traffic
was
halting
and
rushing
halting
and
rushing
up
the
avenue
now
held
motionless
at
a
crossing
now
flowing
on
in
mad
haste
the
lumbering
omnibuses
passing
each
other
little
hansoms
threading
the
mass
and
foot
passengers
scampering
and
withdrawing
and
risking
all
sorts
of
passages
between
the
distance
was
luminous
and
blue
and
lights
pricked
against
it
as
against
a
scarf
of
gauze
oh
it
was
sickening
it
was
sickening
to
think
that
life
was
so
grim
and
hard
for
the
thousands
and
so
unnecessarily
so
superlatively
beautiful
for
the
few
what
had
mary
bishop
and
katrina
ever
done
that
they
should
travel
in
private
cars
fling
aside
furs
that
had
cost
as
much
as
many
a
man
yearly
salary
chatter
of
the
plantation
near
the
beach
at
hawaii
or
of
reaching
saint
james
for
the
january
norma
stopped
to
give
cents
to
an
old
italian
organ
grinder
and
worked
him
into
her
theme
as
she
went
on
why
he
look
so
grateful
for
her
casual
charity
he
seventy
years
old
katrina
and
mary
averaging
less
than
twenty
she
reached
aunt
kate
flat
in
a
thorough
temper
angry
headachy
almost
feverish
after
the
rich
scones
and
the
rich
tea
and
the
even
less
wholesome
talk
the
apartment
house
seemed
as
indeed
it
was
grimy
and
odorous
almost
to
squalor
and
aunt
kate
almost
hateful
in
her
cheerfulness
and
energy
this
was
wednesday
and
on
wednesday
evenings
she
was
always
happy
for
then
wolf
and
norma
came
to
dinner
with
her
busily
manipulating
pans
and
pots
she
told
norma
that
she
had
rented
the
two
extra
bedrooms
of
the
apartment
to
three
young
trained
nurses
ideal
tenants
in
every
way
they
get
their
breakfasts
here
and
if
i
away
there
no
reason
why
they
should
cook
themselves
a
little
dinner
now
and
then
said
aunt
kate
in
her
rich
motherly
voice
they
were
tickled
to
death
to
get
the
two
rooms
for
twenty
dollars
and
that
makes
my
own
rent
only
seventeen
more
i
asked
them
if
that
was
too
much
and
they
said
no
they
expected
to
pay
at
least
ten
apiece
norma
listened
unsympathetic
and
gloomy
it
was
all
so
petty
and
so
poor
trained
nurses
and
apple
pie
and
aunt
kate
renting
rooms
and
wolf
eager
to
be
promoted
to
factory
manager
she
wanted
to
go
back
back
to
the
life
in
which
annie
really
noticed
her
gave
her
luncheons
included
her
she
wanted
to
count
for
something
with
mary
and
katrina
and
leslie
she
wanted
to
talk
to
chris
about
his
possible
ambassadorship
she
wanted
them
all
to
agree
that
norma
wit
and
charm
more
than
made
up
for
norma
lack
of
fortune
while
she
brushed
her
hair
in
the
room
that
would
shortly
accommodate
two
of
the
three
little
nurses
she
indulged
in
an
unsatisfying
dream
in
which
she
went
to
london
with
alice
and
that
autocratic
little
lady
donnyfare
lady
donnyfare
she
would
be
your
ladyship
nineteen
years
old
and
welcomed
to
the
ancestral
mansion
as
her
little
ladyship
norma
set
the
dinner
table
for
three
with
jerks
and
slams
that
slightly
relieved
her
boiling
heart
she
got
the
napkins
from
the
sideboard
drawer
and
reached
for
the
china
sugar
bowl
that
was
part
of
a
set
that
aunt
kate
had
won
at
a
fair
she
set
the
blue
tile
that
she
had
given
aunt
kate
on
a
christmas
where
the
brown
rebecca
teapot
would
stand
and
cut
a
square
slice
of
butter
from
the
end
of
the
new
pound
for
the
blue
glass
dish
and
all
the
time
her
heart
was
bursting
with
grief
and
discontent
and
she
was
beginning
to
realize
for
the
first
time
the
irrevocable
quality
of
the
step
she
had
taken
and
just
how
completely
it
had
shut
her
off
from
the
life
for
which
she
thirsted
wolf
came
in
hungry
dirty
radiantly
happy
with
a
quick
kiss
for
his
mother
and
an
embrace
for
his
wife
into
which
her
slender
figure
and
cloudy
brown
head
almost
disappeared
lord
he
was
starving
and
lord
he
was
dead
and
lord
it
was
good
to
get
home
said
wolf
his
satisfaction
with
life
too
great
to
leave
room
for
any
suspicion
of
his
wife
entire
sympathy
she
told
them
over
the
meal
of
mary
and
katrina
in
whom
their
interest
was
of
a
simple
and
amazed
quality
that
norma
resented
and
of
chris
prospect
which
did
awaken
some
comment
from
sheridan
they
were
a
clever
family
she
said
but
now
wolf
bursting
with
long
suppression
suddenly
took
the
floor
with
his
own
great
news
voorhies
the
manager
of
the
california
plant
had
been
drifting
about
the
newark
factory
for
several
days
and
wolf
had
talked
with
him
respectfully
as
a
man
of
whose
income
is
three
thousand
a
year
may
talk
to
a
manager
and
voorhies
and
jim
palmer
the
newark
manager
and
paul
stromberg
the
had
taken
wolf
to
lunch
with
them
apparently
casually
apparently
from
mere
friendliness
but
voorhies
had
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
seen
the
west
and
stromberg
had
said
that
he
understood
sheridan
family
consisted
merely
of
a
young
wife
and
palmer
had
chanced
to
drop
carelessly
the
fact
that
voorhies
was
not
going
back
to
california
that
was
all
but
it
was
enough
to
send
wolf
back
to
his
work
with
his
head
spinning
california
and
a
managership
of
a
mine
and
six
thousand
it
must
be
it
must
be
that
he
had
been
mentioned
for
it
that
they
had
him
in
mind
he
was
going
even
to
think
of
it
and
norma
must
but
lord
it
meant
being
picked
out
of
the
ranks
it
meant
being
handed
a
commission
on
a
silver
platter
norma
tried
not
to
be
cold
tried
to
rise
to
the
little
he
asked
of
her
as
audience
and
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
noticed
nothing
amiss
in
her
manner
and
of
seeing
him
go
off
to
sleep
when
they
had
made
the
long
trip
home
with
his
head
in
a
whirl
of
glorious
hopes
but
norma
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
cried
herself
to
sleep
chapter
xxvii
the
bitterness
stayed
with
her
and
gradually
robbed
her
life
of
everything
that
was
happy
and
content
her
little
household
round
that
had
been
so
absorbing
and
so
important
became
tedious
and
stupid
rose
who
was
expecting
her
second
confinement
had
her
husband
mother
with
her
and
in
care
of
the
old
baby
and
making
preparations
for
the
new
was
busy
and
had
small
time
for
the
old
companionship
the
evenings
were
too
cold
for
motoring
now
even
if
wolf
had
not
been
completely
buried
in
engineering
journals
and
papers
of
all
sorts
norma
did
not
call
on
annie
again
but
a
fretted
and
outraged
sense
of
annie
coolness
and
aloofness
and
a
somewhat
similar
impression
from
leslie
manner
when
they
met
in
fifth
avenue
one
day
was
always
in
her
mind
they
could
drop
her
as
easily
as
they
had
picked
her
up
these
melroses
she
consoled
herself
for
a
few
days
with
spectacular
fancies
of
annie
consternation
should
norma
real
identity
be
suddenly
revealed
to
her
but
even
that
poor
solace
was
taken
away
from
her
at
last
it
was
aunt
kate
unconscious
hand
that
struck
the
blow
on
a
wild
afternoon
all
hallow
as
it
happened
when
the
older
woman
made
the
long
trip
to
see
rose
and
came
on
to
norma
with
a
report
that
everything
was
going
well
and
miggs
more
fascinating
than
ever
sheridan
found
norma
at
the
close
of
the
short
afternoon
moping
in
her
unlighted
house
she
had
been
to
the
theatre
with
wolf
and
a
young
couple
from
the
house
next
door
last
night
and
had
fallen
asleep
after
an
afternoon
walk
and
felt
headachy
prickly
with
heat
and
cold
and
stupid
yawning
and
chilly
she
kissed
her
aunt
and
suggested
that
they
move
to
the
kitchen
it
was
inga
free
night
and
norma
was
cook
you
stay
and
surprise
wolf
he
love
it
norma
said
as
the
visitor
approving
eyes
noted
the
general
order
and
warmth
the
towels
and
blue
bowls
the
white
table
and
white
walls
the
little
baby
of
the
family
was
proceeding
to
get
her
husband
a
most
satisfactory
and
delicious
little
dinner
and
aunt
kate
was
proud
of
her
did
you
make
that
cake
darling
indeed
i
did
she
ca
make
cake
and
the
ham
well
norma
eyed
the
cut
ham
fondly
we
did
that
together
out
of
the
book
and
i
wish
you
taste
it
aunt
kate
it
is
perfectly
delicious
i
give
it
to
wolf
every
other
night
but
i
think
he
eat
it
three
times
a
day
and
be
delighted
and
last
week
we
made
bread
awfully
good
too
not
hard
like
that
bread
we
made
last
summer
rolls
we
made
cinnamon
rolls
and
plain
harry
and
rose
were
here
and
thanksgiving
i
going
to
try
mincemeat
you
a
born
cook
aunt
kate
said
paying
one
of
her
highest
compliments
with
due
gravity
but
norma
did
not
respond
with
her
usual
buoyancy
she
sighed
impatiently
and
her
face
fell
into
lines
of
discontent
and
sadness
that
did
not
escape
the
watching
eyes
sheridan
changed
the
subject
to
the
one
of
a
cousin
of
harry
redding
one
barry
with
whose
problems
norma
was
already
dismally
familiar
barry
husband
was
sick
in
a
hospital
and
she
herself
had
to
have
an
expensive
operation
and
the
smallest
of
the
four
children
had
some
trouble
hideously
like
infantile
paralysis
norma
knew
that
aunt
kate
would
have
liked
to
have
her
offer
to
take
at
least
one
of
the
small
and
troublesome
children
for
two
or
three
days
if
not
to
stay
with
the
unfortunate
kitty
barry
outright
she
knew
that
there
was
almost
no
money
that
all
the
household
details
of
washing
and
cooking
were
piling
up
like
a
mountain
about
the
ailing
woman
but
her
heart
was
filled
with
sudden
rebellion
and
impatience
with
the
whole
miserable
scheme
my
goodness
aunt
kate
if
it
is
one
thing
with
those
people
another
she
said
impatiently
i
suppose
you
were
there
and
up
with
that
baby
all
night
indeed
i
got
some
fine
sleep
sheridan
answered
innocently
poor
things
they
very
brave
norma
said
nothing
but
her
expression
was
not
sympathetic
she
had
been
thinking
of
herself
as
to
be
pitied
and
this
ruthless
introduction
of
the
barry
question
entirely
upset
the
argument
if
mary
bishop
and
katrina
thayer
were
the
standard
then
norma
sheridan
life
was
too
utterly
obscure
and
insignificant
to
be
worth
living
but
of
course
if
incompetent
strugglers
like
the
barrys
were
to
be
brought
into
the
question
then
norma
might
begin
to
feel
the
solid
ground
melting
from
beneath
her
feet
she
did
not
offer
the
cake
or
the
ham
to
aunt
kate
as
contributions
toward
the
small
barrys
lunch
next
day
nor
did
she
invite
any
one
of
them
to
visit
her
her
aunt
if
she
noted
these
omissions
made
no
comment
upon
them
i
declare
you
are
getting
to
be
a
real
woman
norma
she
said
i
suppose
everyone
grows
up
norma
assented
cheerlessly
yes
there
a
time
when
a
child
stops
being
a
baby
and
you
see
that
it
beginning
to
be
a
little
girl
sheridan
mused
but
it
some
time
later
before
you
know
of
a
little
girl
it
is
and
then
at
say
fifteen
or
sixteen
you
see
the
change
again
the
little
girl
growing
into
a
grown
girl
a
young
lady
and
for
awhile
you
sort
of
lose
track
of
her
again
until
all
of
a
sudden
you
say
norma
going
to
be
sociable
and
like
people
or
is
going
to
be
a
gentle
shy
girl
norma
knew
the
mildly
moralizing
tone
and
that
she
was
getting
a
sermon
you
never
knew
that
i
was
going
to
be
a
good
housekeeper
she
asserted
inclined
toward
contrariety
i
think
you
going
through
another
change
now
baby
her
aunt
said
you
become
a
woman
too
fast
you
do
quite
know
where
you
are
this
was
so
unexpectedly
acute
that
norma
was
inwardly
surprised
and
a
little
impressed
she
sat
down
at
one
end
of
the
clean
little
kitchen
table
and
rested
her
face
in
her
hands
and
looked
resentfully
at
the
older
woman
then
you
think
i
a
good
housekeeper
she
said
looking
hurt
i
think
you
will
be
whatever
you
want
to
be
norma
it
all
be
in
your
hands
now
sheridan
answered
seriously
you
a
woman
now
you
wolf
wife
you
reached
an
age
when
you
can
choose
and
decide
for
yourself
you
can
be
you
always
could
be
the
best
child
the
lord
ever
made
or
you
can
fret
and
brood
over
what
you
have
got
the
shrewd
kindly
eye
seemed
looking
into
norma
very
soul
the
girl
dropped
her
hard
bright
stare
and
looked
sulky
i
do
see
what
doing
she
muttered
i
ca
help
wanting
what
other
people
that
are
no
better
than
i
have
yes
but
have
you
enough
norma
think
of
women
like
poor
kitty
barry
oh
kitty
barry
kitty
barry
norma
burst
out
angrily
it
is
my
fault
that
kitty
barry
has
trouble
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
look
at
people
like
leslie
what
she
wastes
on
one
new
fur
coat
would
keep
the
barrys
for
a
year
hundred
dollars
she
paid
for
her
birthday
coat
and
that
katrina
thayer
norma
norma
norma
her
aunt
interrupted
reproachfully
what
have
you
to
do
with
girls
like
the
thayer
girl
why
there
are
twenty
girls
in
the
country
as
rich
as
that
that
does
affect
if
there
something
you
can
do
for
the
poor
and
unfortunate
it
affect
me
i
ca
norma
dropped
her
tone
and
glanced
at
her
aunt
she
knew
that
she
was
misbehaving
i
ca
help
inheriting
a
love
for
money
she
said
breathing
hard
i
know
perfectly
well
who
i
am
who
my
mother
is
she
ended
with
a
and
sob
in
her
voice
how
do
you
mean
that
you
know
about
your
mother
norma
sheridan
demanded
sharply
well
norma
had
calmed
a
little
and
she
was
a
trifle
nervous
chris
told
me
and
aunt
alice
knows
too
that
aunt
annie
is
my
mother
she
said
chris
liggett
told
you
that
sheridan
asked
with
a
note
of
incredulity
in
her
voice
yes
aunt
alice
guessed
it
almost
as
soon
as
i
went
to
live
there
and
i
known
it
for
over
a
year
norma
said
and
who
told
chris
well
aunt
marianna
i
suppose
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
norma
said
sheridan
in
a
quiet
convincing
tone
that
cooled
the
girl
hot
blood
instantly
chris
is
entirely
wrong
your
mother
is
dead
i
never
lied
to
you
and
i
give
you
my
word
i
do
know
where
miss
alice
got
that
idea
but
it
like
her
romantic
way
of
fancying
things
no
dear
she
went
on
sympathetically
as
norma
sat
silent
by
painful
surprise
you
have
no
claim
on
miss
annie
both
your
father
and
mother
are
dead
norma
i
knew
them
both
there
was
a
reason
sheridan
added
thoughtfully
why
i
felt
that
melrose
might
want
to
be
kind
to
you
want
to
undo
an
injustice
she
did
years
ago
but
i
told
myself
a
thousand
times
that
i
did
you
a
cruel
wrong
when
i
first
let
you
go
among
them
you
who
were
always
so
sensible
and
so
cheerful
and
who
would
always
take
things
as
they
came
and
make
no
fuss
oh
aunt
kate
norma
stammered
bitterly
her
lip
trembling
and
her
voice
fighting
tears
you
do
have
to
tell
me
that
in
your
opinion
i
changed
for
the
worse
i
see
it
in
the
way
you
look
at
me
always
thought
rose
was
an
angel
too
good
to
live
and
that
i
was
spoiled
and
lazy
and
you
were
glad
enough
to
get
rid
of
me
and
now
i
hope
you
satisfied
they
told
me
one
thing
and
you
told
me
another
and
i
guess
the
truth
is
that
i
do
belong
to
anybody
and
i
wish
i
was
dead
where
my
and
are
and
stumbling
into
incoherence
and
tears
norma
dropped
her
head
on
her
arm
and
sobbed
bitterly
sheridan
face
was
full
of
pain
but
she
did
not
soften
you
belong
to
your
husband
norma
she
said
mildly
norma
sat
up
and
wiped
her
eyes
on
a
little
handkerchief
that
she
took
from
the
pocket
of
her
housewifely
blue
apron
she
did
not
meet
her
aunt
eye
and
still
looked
angry
and
hurt
well
who
i
then
have
i
got
some
right
to
know
who
my
mother
and
father
were
she
demanded
that
you
will
never
hear
from
me
sheridan
replied
firmly
but
aunt
kate
i
gave
my
solemn
promise
norma
and
i
kept
my
word
all
these
years
i
not
likely
to
break
it
now
but
wo
i
know
sheridan
shrugged
her
broad
shoulders
and
frowned
slightly
that
i
ca
say
my
dear
she
said
gently
some
day
i
may
be
released
from
my
bond
and
then
i
be
glad
to
tell
you
everything
perhaps
wolf
will
tell
me
he
nothing
to
me
now
the
girl
continued
with
childish
temper
wolf
and
all
of
us
think
that
there
nobody
like
you
the
older
woman
said
tenderly
but
norma
did
not
brighten
she
went
in
a
businesslike
way
to
the
stove
and
glanced
at
the
various
bowls
and
saucepans
in
which
dinner
was
baking
and
boiling
then
sliced
some
stale
bread
neatly
put
the
shaved
crusts
in
a
special
jar
and
began
to
toast
the
slices
with
a
charming
precision
change
your
mind
and
stay
with
us
aunt
kate
she
said
lifelessly
no
dear
i
going
and
aunt
kate
really
did
bundle
herself
into
coat
and
rubber
overshoes
and
woolly
scarf
again
november
coming
in
with
a
storm
she
predicted
glancing
out
at
the
darkness
where
the
wind
was
rushing
and
howling
drearily
norma
did
not
answer
no
mere
rushing
of
clouds
and
whirl
of
dry
and
colourless
leaves
could
match
the
storm
of
disappointment
that
was
beginning
to
rage
in
her
own
heart
yet
she
felt
a
pang
of
repentance
when
cheerful
aunt
kate
had
tramped
off
in
the
dark
to
rose
house
which
was
five
blocks
away
and
perhaps
afterward
to
the
desolate
barrys
and
wished
that
she
had
put
her
arms
about
the
big
square
shoulders
and
her
cheek
against
her
aunt
cheek
and
said
that
she
was
sorry
to
be
unreasonable
rushing
to
another
extreme
of
unreason
she
decided
that
she
and
wolf
must
go
see
rose
and
perhaps
the
barrys
too
and
cheer
and
solace
them
all
and
norma
indulged
in
a
little
dream
of
herself
nursing
and
cooking
in
the
barrys
six
little
cluttered
rooms
and
earning
golden
opinions
from
all
the
group
there
was
money
too
she
had
not
used
all
of
october
allowance
and
would
find
another
big
check
at
the
bank
wolf
interrupted
by
coming
in
so
tired
he
could
hardly
move
he
ate
his
dinner
yawned
amiably
in
the
kitchen
while
she
cleared
it
away
and
was
so
sound
asleep
at
nine
that
norma
bedside
light
and
the
rustling
of
the
pages
of
her
book
three
feet
away
from
his
face
had
no
more
effect
upon
him
than
if
the
three
feet
had
been
three
hundred
and
then
the
bitter
mood
came
back
to
her
again
the
bored
restless
impatient
feeling
that
her
life
was
a
stupid
affair
and
deep
in
her
heart
the
sense
of
hurt
and
humiliation
grew
and
spread
the
thought
that
she
was
not
of
the
charmed
circle
of
the
melroses
not
secretly
and
romantically
akin
to
them
she
was
merely
the
casual
object
of
the
old
lady
fantastic
sense
of
obligation
aunt
kate
who
had
never
said
what
was
untrue
who
norma
and
her
children
firmly
believed
could
not
say
what
was
untrue
had
taken
away
once
and
for
all
the
veil
of
mystery
and
romance
that
had
wrapped
norma
for
three
exciting
years
for
leslie
and
katrina
and
mary
bishop
perhaps
travel
and
the
thrill
of
foreign
shores
or
european
courts
but
for
wolf
sheridan
wife
this
small
orderly
charming
house
on
the
edge
of
the
new
jersey
woods
and
the
laundry
to
think
of
every
monday
and
the
ordering
to
remember
every
saturday
as
long
as
the
world
went
round
for
a
few
days
norma
really
suffered
in
spirit
then
the
natural
healthy
current
of
her
life
reëstablished
itself
and
she
philosophically
determined
to
make
the
best
of
the
matter
if
she
was
not
aunt
daughter
and
leslie
cousin
she
was
at
least
their
friend
they
even
unsuspecting
of
any
strange
relationship
had
always
been
kind
to
her
and
aunt
marianna
and
aunt
alice
had
been
definitely
affectionate
to
say
nothing
of
chris
so
one
day
when
she
happened
to
be
shopping
in
the
winter
briskness
of
the
packed
and
brilliant
avenue
she
telephoned
leslie
at
about
the
luncheon
hour
leslie
when
last
they
met
had
said
that
she
would
confidently
expect
norma
to
run
out
and
lunch
with
her
some
day
any
day
who
is
it
leslie
voice
asked
irritably
when
at
last
the
telephone
connection
was
established
oh
oh
what
is
it
just
wondering
how
you
all
were
and
what
the
family
news
is
norma
said
with
an
uncomfortable
inclination
to
falter
i
do
you
leslie
protested
impatiently
the
insignificant
inquiry
did
not
seem
to
gain
much
by
repetition
and
norma
cheeks
burned
in
shame
when
leslie
followed
it
by
a
blank
little
pause
oh
everyone
fine
the
baby
was
well
but
she
all
right
now
another
slight
pause
then
norma
said
she
must
be
adorable
i
like
to
see
her
she
not
here
now
leslie
answered
quickly
i
been
shopping
norma
said
any
chance
that
you
could
come
down
town
and
lunch
with
me
no
i
really
could
leslie
answered
lightly
and
promptly
a
moment
later
norma
said
she
walked
away
from
the
telephone
booth
with
her
face
burning
and
her
heart
beating
quickly
with
anger
and
resentment
snob
snob
snob
she
said
to
herself
furiously
of
leslie
and
of
herself
she
presently
added
honestly
and
i
was
much
better
for
i
do
really
like
her
any
more
than
she
does
me
and
she
stopped
for
flowers
and
a
little
box
of
pastry
and
went
out
to
delight
her
aunt
kate
heart
with
an
unexpected
visit
but
a
sting
remained
and
norma
brooded
over
the
injustice
of
life
as
she
went
about
her
little
house
in
the
wintry
sunlight
and
listened
to
wolf
and
made
much
of
rose
and
the
new
baby
girl
by
thanksgiving
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
only
dreamed
of
aïda
and
of
newport
and
that
the
norma
of
the
wonderful
frocks
and
the
wonderful
dreams
had
been
only
a
dream
herself
chapter
xxviii
and
then
suddenly
she
was
delighted
to
have
a
friendly
little
note
from
alice
asking
her
to
come
to
luncheon
on
a
certain
december
friday
as
there
was
a
tiny
bit
of
business
that
she
would
like
to
discuss
chris
was
away
she
would
be
alone
norma
accepted
with
no
more
than
ordinary
politeness
and
showed
neither
wolf
nor
his
mother
any
elation
but
she
felt
a
deep
satisfaction
in
the
renewed
relationship
on
the
appointed
friday
at
one
she
mounted
the
familiar
steps
of
the
christopher
liggetts
house
and
greeted
the
butler
with
a
delighted
sense
of
returning
to
her
own
alice
was
in
the
front
room
before
a
wood
fire
she
greeted
norma
with
her
old
smile
and
with
an
outstretched
hand
but
norma
was
shocked
to
see
how
drawn
and
strangely
aged
the
smile
was
and
how
thin
the
hand
the
room
had
its
old
scent
of
violets
and
its
old
ordered
beauty
and
richness
but
norma
was
vaguely
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
some
new
invalid
quality
of
fussiness
of
a
pretty
and
superfluous
cluttering
that
had
not
been
characteristic
of
alice
belongings
a
year
ago
alice
too
wore
newly
a
certain
stamp
of
frailty
her
always
pure
high
forehead
had
a
faint
transparency
and
shine
that
norma
did
not
remember
and
the
increasing
accumulation
of
pillows
and
little
bookcases
and
handsome
stands
about
her
suggested
that
her
horizon
was
closing
in
that
her
world
was
diminishing
to
this
room
and
this
room
alone
the
strange
nurse
who
smilingly
and
noiselessly
slipped
away
as
norma
came
in
was
another
vaguely
disquieting
hint
of
helplessness
but
norma
knew
better
than
to
make
any
comment
upon
her
impressions
and
merely
asked
the
usual
casual
questions
as
she
sat
down
near
the
couch
how
are
you
aunt
alice
but
you
look
splendidly
i
so
said
alice
emphatically
with
a
sort
of
solemn
thankfulness
that
i
do
know
myself
whether
it
was
saving
myself
the
strain
of
moving
to
newport
last
summer
or
what
i
do
know
but
i
have
been
so
well
for
norma
heart
contracted
with
sudden
pity
alice
had
never
employed
these
gallant
falsehoods
before
she
had
always
been
quite
obviously
happy
and
busy
and
even
enviable
in
her
limited
sphere
the
girl
chatted
away
with
her
naturally
enough
while
the
luncheon
table
was
arranged
between
them
and
the
fire
but
she
noticed
that
two
nurses
shifted
the
invalid
into
an
upright
position
before
the
meal
and
that
alice
face
was
white
with
exhaustion
as
she
began
to
sip
her
bouillon
they
were
alone
an
hour
later
playing
with
little
boxed
ices
when
alice
suddenly
revealed
the
object
of
the
meeting
norma
had
asked
for
chris
who
was
it
appeared
absent
on
some
matter
of
business
for
a
few
days
and
it
was
in
connection
with
the
introduction
of
his
name
that
alice
spoke
chris
that
reminds
me
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
something
norma
i
wanted
to
for
months
really
it
not
really
important
because
of
course
you
never
would
mention
it
any
more
than
i
would
and
yet
it
just
as
well
to
have
this
sort
of
thing
straightened
out
chris
told
me
said
alice
looking
straight
at
norma
who
had
grown
a
trifle
pale
and
was
watching
her
fixedly
chris
told
me
that
some
months
before
you
were
married
he
told
you
of
some
some
ridiculous
suspicions
we
had
it
seems
absurd
now
about
annie
so
that
was
it
norma
could
breathe
again
yes
we
talked
about
it
one
morning
walking
home
from
church
she
admitted
i
do
know
whether
you
know
now
alice
said
quickly
flushing
nervously
that
there
was
one
shred
of
foundation
for
that
that
crazy
suspicion
of
mine
but
i
give
you
my
word
and
my
mother
told
me
that
it
was
so
i
do
know
how
i
ever
came
to
think
of
it
or
why
i
thought
mama
admitted
it
but
i
realized
said
alice
nervously
that
it
was
a
terrible
injustice
to
annie
and
as
soon
as
chris
told
me
that
you
knew
it
and
of
course
he
had
to
let
it
get
any
further
i
wanted
to
set
it
straight
poor
annie
she
would
be
perfectly
frantic
if
she
knew
how
calmly
i
was
saddling
her
with
a
a
terrible
past
said
alice
laughing
but
i
have
always
been
too
sensitive
where
the
people
i
love
are
concerned
and
i
blundered
into
this
this
outrageous
my
aunt
had
told
me
that
it
was
not
so
norma
said
coolly
and
superbly
interrupting
the
somewhat
incoherent
story
if
i
ever
really
believed
it
she
added
scornfully
for
her
heart
was
hot
with
rage
and
the
first
impulse
was
to
vent
it
upon
this
nearest
of
the
supercilious
melroses
this
was
all
alice
had
wanted
then
in
sending
that
little
overture
of
friendship
to
tell
the
little
nobody
that
she
was
nothing
to
the
great
family
after
all
to
prevent
her
from
ever
boasting
even
an
illicit
relationship
it
was
for
a
formal
snub
a
definite
that
norma
had
been
brought
all
the
way
from
the
little
house
in
new
jersey
her
eyes
grew
very
bright
and
her
lips
very
firm
as
she
and
alice
finished
the
topic
and
she
told
herself
that
she
would
never
never
enter
the
house
of
liggett
again
alice
this
load
off
her
mind
and
the
family
honour
secure
became
much
more
friendly
and
she
and
norma
were
talking
animatedly
when
leslie
and
annie
came
unexpectedly
in
they
had
been
to
a
débutante
luncheon
and
were
going
to
a
débutante
tea
and
meanwhile
wanted
a
few
minutes
with
dear
alice
and
the
latest
news
of
melrose
who
was
in
florida
aunt
and
niece
were
magnificently
furred
and
jewelled
magnificently
unaware
of
the
existence
of
little
sheridan
of
east
orange
norma
knew
in
a
second
that
the
social
ripples
had
closed
over
her
head
she
was
of
no
further
possible
significance
in
the
life
of
either
leslie
was
pretty
bored
annie
her
usual
stunning
and
radiantly
satisfied
self
the
conversation
speedily
left
norma
stranded
the
chatter
of
engagements
of
scandals
of
new
names
was
all
strange
to
her
and
she
sat
through
some
ten
minutes
of
it
uncomfortably
longing
to
go
and
not
quite
knowing
how
to
start
she
said
to
herself
that
she
was
done
with
the
melroses
never
never
never
again
would
even
their
most
fervently
extended
favour
win
from
her
so
much
as
a
civil
acknowledgment
there
was
a
step
in
the
hall
and
a
voice
that
drove
the
blood
from
norma
face
and
made
her
heart
begin
the
old
frantic
fluttering
and
thumping
before
she
could
attempt
to
collect
her
thoughts
the
door
opened
and
chris
came
in
he
came
straight
to
alice
and
kissed
her
holding
her
hand
as
he
greeted
annie
and
leslie
then
he
came
across
the
hearthrug
and
norma
got
to
her
feet
and
felt
that
his
hand
was
as
cold
as
hers
and
that
the
room
was
rocking
about
her
hello
norma
he
said
quietly
i
did
expect
to
find
you
here
you
have
seen
her
since
she
was
married
chris
alice
said
and
chris
agreed
with
a
pleasant
that
so
he
sat
down
and
norma
incapable
of
any
effort
at
least
until
she
could
control
the
emotion
that
was
shaking
her
like
a
vertigo
sank
back
into
her
own
chair
unseeing
and
unhearing
the
gold
clock
on
the
mantel
ticked
and
tocked
the
other
three
women
chatted
and
laughed
and
chris
contributed
his
share
to
the
general
conversation
but
norma
one
desperate
need
was
for
escape
he
made
no
protest
when
she
said
hasty
farewells
but
when
she
had
gone
rapidly
and
almost
blindly
down
the
stairway
and
was
at
the
front
door
she
found
him
beside
her
he
got
into
his
coat
picked
up
his
hat
and
they
descended
to
the
sidewalk
together
in
the
colourless
airless
sunless
light
of
the
winter
afternoon
get
in
my
car
chris
said
indicating
the
roadster
at
the
curb
the
girl
without
a
word
obeyed
his
voice
the
motion
of
his
mouth
the
searching
glance
of
his
quick
keen
eyes
acted
upon
her
like
a
charm
alice
wolf
every
thing
else
in
the
world
vanished
from
her
thoughts
or
rather
had
never
been
there
she
was
drinking
again
the
forbidden
waters
for
which
she
had
thirsted
perhaps
without
quite
knowing
it
so
long
the
strangeness
the
strain
the
artifice
of
the
last
eight
months
fell
from
her
like
a
spell
she
was
herself
again
comfortable
again
poised
again
thrilling
from
head
to
heels
with
delicious
and
bubbling
life
ready
for
anything
now
that
they
were
alone
she
felt
no
more
nervousness
he
would
speak
to
her
when
he
was
ready
he
could
not
leave
her
without
speaking
norma
settled
back
comfortably
in
the
deep
low
seat
and
glanced
sidewise
at
the
stern
profile
that
showed
between
his
high
fur
collar
and
the
fur
cap
he
had
pulled
well
down
over
his
ears
the
world
seemed
changed
to
her
she
had
wakened
from
a
long
dream
no
not
the
old
house
she
presently
broke
the
silence
to
tell
him
i
go
to
new
jersey
he
had
been
driving
slowly
out
fifth
avenue
now
he
obediently
turned
and
threaded
his
way
through
the
traffic
until
they
were
within
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
of
the
entrance
to
the
new
jersey
subways
then
he
ran
the
car
close
to
the
curb
and
stopped
and
for
the
first
time
looked
fully
at
norma
and
she
saw
his
old
pleasant
smile
well
and
how
goes
it
he
asked
how
is
wolf
tell
me
where
you
are
living
and
all
about
it
norma
in
answer
gave
him
a
report
upon
her
own
affairs
and
spoke
of
aunt
kate
and
rose
and
rose
children
she
did
not
realize
that
a
tone
almost
pleading
almost
apologetic
crept
into
her
eager
voice
while
she
spoke
and
told
its
own
story
chris
watched
her
closely
his
eyes
never
leaving
her
face
all
around
them
moved
the
confusion
and
congestion
of
sixth
avenue
overhead
the
elevated
road
roared
and
crashed
but
neither
man
nor
woman
was
more
than
vaguely
conscious
of
surroundings
and
are
you
happy
norma
chris
asked
oh
yes
she
answered
quickly
you
are
a
very
game
little
liar
he
said
dispassionately
no
no
i
not
blaming
you
he
added
hastily
as
she
would
have
spoken
you
took
the
very
best
way
out
and
i
respect
and
honour
you
for
it
i
was
not
surprised
although
the
possibility
had
never
occurred
to
me
something
in
his
cool
almost
lifeless
tone
chilled
her
and
she
did
not
speak
when
i
heard
of
it
chris
said
i
went
to
canada
i
do
remember
the
details
exactly
but
i
remember
one
day
sitting
up
there
in
the
woods
somewhere
and
looking
at
my
hunting
knife
and
looking
at
my
wrist
he
looked
at
his
wrist
now
and
her
eyes
followed
and
if
i
had
thought
chris
presently
continued
that
a
slash
there
might
have
carried
me
to
some
region
of
peace
where
there
was
no
hunger
for
norma
i
would
not
have
hesitated
but
one
is
sure
more
the
pity
he
finished
smiling
with
eyes
full
of
pain
norma
could
not
speak
the
work
of
long
months
had
been
undone
in
a
short
hour
and
she
was
conscious
of
a
world
that
crashed
and
tumbled
in
utter
ruin
about
her
well
no
use
now
chris
said
he
folded
his
arms
on
his
chest
and
looked
sternly
away
into
space
for
a
minute
and
norma
felt
his
his
repression
as
she
would
have
felt
no
passionate
outburst
of
reproach
but
there
is
one
thing
that
i
wanted
for
a
long
time
to
tell
you
norma
if
you
had
been
such
a
little
girl
if
you
had
known
what
life
is
you
could
not
have
done
what
you
did
i
suppose
not
she
with
a
dry
throat
as
he
waited
for
some
sign
from
her
no
you
could
have
given
yourself
to
any
one
else
if
you
had
known
chris
went
on
as
if
musing
aloud
and
that
brings
me
to
what
i
want
to
say
marriage
lasts
a
long
long
time
norma
and
even
you
with
all
your
courage
may
find
that
you
promised
more
than
you
can
perform
the
time
may
come
norma
i
hope
it
wo
he
interrupted
himself
to
say
bitterly
i
try
to
hope
it
wo
i
try
to
hope
that
you
will
come
to
love
him
my
dear
and
forget
me
but
if
that
time
does
come
what
i
want
you
to
remember
is
this
afternoon
and
sitting
here
with
me
in
the
car
and
chris
telling
you
that
whenever
or
wherever
or
however
he
can
serve
you
you
are
to
remember
that
he
is
living
just
for
that
hour
there
will
never
be
any
change
in
me
norma
never
anything
but
longing
and
longing
just
for
the
sight
of
you
just
for
one
word
from
you
i
love
you
my
dear
i
ca
help
it
god
knows
i
to
help
it
i
love
you
as
i
do
believe
any
other
woman
in
the
world
was
ever
loved
so
much
that
i
want
life
to
be
good
to
you
even
if
i
never
see
you
and
i
want
you
to
be
happy
even
without
me
he
had
squared
about
to
face
her
and
as
the
passionate
rush
of
words
swept
about
her
norma
laid
her
little
gloved
hand
gently
upon
his
big
one
and
her
blue
eyes
drowned
in
sudden
tears
fixed
themselves
in
exquisite
desolation
and
despair
upon
his
face
once
or
twice
she
had
whispered
i
know
i
know
as
if
to
herself
but
she
did
not
interrupt
him
and
when
he
paused
he
saw
that
she
was
choked
with
tears
and
could
not
speak
the
mad
and
wonderful
sacrifice
you
made
i
ca
talk
about
norma
he
said
only
an
ignorant
little
girl
like
you
could
have
done
that
but
that
all
over
now
you
must
try
to
make
your
life
what
they
think
it
is
those
good
people
that
love
you
and
i
try
too
i
do
try
and
you
must
cry
my
little
sweetheart
chris
added
with
a
tenderness
so
new
and
so
poignantly
sweet
that
norma
was
almost
faint
with
the
sheer
joy
of
it
you
must
blame
me
for
just
saying
this
this
once
because
it
for
the
last
time
we
must
meet
his
voice
dropped
i
think
we
must
meet
he
repeated
painfully
and
slowly
no
she
agreed
quickly
but
you
are
to
remember
that
chris
reiterated
that
i
am
living
and
moving
about
and
going
to
the
office
and
back
to
my
home
only
because
you
are
alive
in
the
world
and
the
day
may
come
when
i
can
serve
you
life
has
been
only
that
to
me
for
a
long
long
time
for
a
long
minute
norma
sat
silent
her
dark
lashes
fallen
on
her
cheek
her
eyes
on
the
hand
that
she
had
grasped
in
her
own
i
remember
chris
thank
you
chris
she
said
simply
then
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
straight
at
him
with
a
childish
little
frown
puzzled
and
bewildered
on
her
forehead
and
they
exchanged
a
long
look
of
chris
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
norma
very
quietly
slipped
from
her
seat
and
turned
once
to
smile
bravely
at
him
before
she
was
lost
in
the
swiftly
moving
whirlpool
of
the
subway
entrance
she
was
trembling
as
she
seated
herself
in
the
train
and
moved
upon
her
way
scarcely
conscious
of
what
she
was
doing
but
chris
did
not
move
from
his
seat
for
more
than
an
hour
norma
went
home
and
quickly
and
deftly
began
her
preparations
for
dinner
inga
had
been
married
a
few
weeks
before
and
so
norma
had
no
maid
she
put
her
new
hat
into
its
tissue
paper
and
tied
a
fresh
checked
apron
over
her
filmy
best
waist
and
stepped
to
and
fro
between
stove
and
dining
table
as
efficient
a
little
housekeeper
as
all
new
jersey
could
show
wolf
came
home
hungry
and
and
kissed
her
and
sat
at
the
end
of
her
little
kitchen
table
while
she
put
the
last
touches
to
the
meal
appreciative
and
amusing
a
new
magazine
for
her
in
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
an
invitation
from
his
mother
for
dinner
night
and
a
pleasant
suggestion
that
he
and
she
wander
up
broadway
again
and
look
in
windows
after
his
mother
dinner
they
talked
while
they
dined
of
the
possibility
of
the
california
move
and
wolf
afterward
went
down
to
the
furnace
when
the
fire
was
banked
for
the
night
he
watched
the
last
of
the
dinner
clearance
and
they
went
across
the
cold
dark
strip
of
land
between
their
house
and
a
neighbour
to
play
three
exciting
rubbers
of
bridge
and
at
eleven
wolf
was
asleep
and
norma
reading
again
or
trying
to
read
but
her
blood
was
racing
and
her
head
was
spinning
and
before
she
slept
she
brought
out
all
her
memories
of
the
afternoon
words
rang
in
her
heart
again
and
the
glances
that
had
accompanied
them
unrolled
before
her
eyes
like
some
long
pageant
that
was
infinitely
wonderful
and
thrilling
leslie
and
annie
and
alice
might
snub
her
but
chris
their
idol
the
cleverest
and
most
charming
man
in
all
their
circle
chris
loved
her
chris
loved
her
and
from
those
old
dreamy
days
in
biretta
bookstore
had
she
not
loved
chris
another
morning
came
another
night
and
life
went
its
usual
way
but
norma
was
wrapped
in
a
dream
that
was
truly
a
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
and
of
flame
by
night
she
was
hardly
aware
of
the
people
about
her
except
that
her
inner
consciousness
of
happiness
and
of
elation
gave
her
an
even
added
sweetness
and
charm
made
her
readier
to
please
them
and
more
anxious
for
their
love
wolf
almost
immediately
saw
the
change
but
she
did
not
see
the
shadow
that
came
to
be
habitual
in
his
young
face
nor
read
aright
his
grave
eyes
she
supposed
him
perhaps
unusually
busy
if
indeed
she
thought
of
him
at
all
like
her
aunt
and
rose
and
the
rest
of
her
world
he
was
no
more
now
than
a
kindly
and
dependable
shadow
something
to
be
quickly
put
aside
for
the
reality
of
her
absorbing
friendship
for
chris
chapter
xxix
despite
their
resolve
not
to
see
each
other
in
the
two
weeks
that
followed
alice
luncheon
norma
had
seen
chris
three
times
he
had
written
her
on
the
third
day
and
she
had
met
the
postman
at
the
corner
sure
that
the
big
square
envelope
would
be
there
they
had
had
luncheon
far
down
town
and
walked
up
through
the
snowy
streets
together
parting
with
an
engagement
for
the
fourth
day
ahead
a
matinée
and
tea
engagement
the
third
meeting
had
been
for
luncheon
again
and
after
lunch
they
had
wandered
through
an
avenue
gallery
looking
at
the
pictures
and
talking
about
themselves
chris
had
loaned
her
books
little
slim
books
of
dramas
or
essays
and
chris
had
talked
to
her
of
plays
and
music
one
night
when
wolf
was
in
philadelphia
chris
took
her
to
the
opera
again
duly
returning
her
to
aunt
kate
at
eleven
and
politely
disclaiming
aunt
gratitude
for
his
goodness
to
little
norma
he
never
attempted
to
touch
her
to
kiss
her
he
never
permitted
himself
an
affectionate
term
or
a
hint
of
the
passion
that
enveloped
him
they
were
friends
that
was
all
and
surely
surely
they
told
themselves
a
man
and
woman
may
be
friends
may
talk
and
walk
and
lunch
together
and
harm
no
one
norma
knew
that
it
was
the
one
vital
element
in
chris
life
as
in
her
own
and
that
the
hours
that
he
did
not
spend
with
her
were
filled
with
plans
and
anticipations
for
their
times
together
one
evening
just
before
christmas
when
the
young
sheridans
were
staying
through
a
heavy
storm
with
their
mother
wolf
came
home
with
the
news
that
he
must
spend
some
weeks
in
philadelphia
studying
a
new
method
of
refining
iron
ore
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
this
transfer
was
but
a
preliminary
to
the
promotion
to
the
california
managership
but
wolf
took
it
very
quietly
with
none
of
the
exultation
that
the
compliment
once
would
have
caused
him
i
go
with
you
to
philadelphia
norma
said
not
quite
naturally
she
had
been
made
vaguely
uneasy
by
his
repressed
manner
and
by
the
fact
that
her
kiss
of
greeting
had
been
almost
put
aside
by
him
at
the
door
a
few
minutes
earlier
dear
old
wolf
she
had
always
loved
him
she
would
not
have
him
unhappy
for
all
the
world
in
answer
he
looked
at
her
unsmilingly
wearily
narrowing
his
eyes
as
if
to
concentrate
his
thoughts
you
ca
very
well
but
thank
you
just
the
same
norma
he
said
formally
i
shall
be
with
voorhies
and
palmer
and
bender
all
the
time
they
put
me
up
at
a
club
and
there
be
plenty
of
evening
work
nearly
every
evening
norma
stay
here
with
me
aunt
kate
said
hospitably
well
wolf
agreed
indifferently
i
can
run
up
from
philadelphia
and
be
home
every
saturday
mother
he
added
norma
felt
vaguely
alarmed
by
his
manner
and
devoted
her
best
efforts
to
amusing
and
interesting
him
for
the
rest
of
the
meal
after
dinner
she
came
in
from
the
kitchen
to
find
him
in
a
big
chair
in
the
little
front
parlour
and
she
seated
herself
upon
an
arm
of
it
and
put
her
own
arm
loosely
about
his
neck
what
are
you
reading
wolf
shall
we
go
out
and
burn
up
broadway
there
a
wonderful
picture
at
the
favourite
he
tossed
his
paper
aside
and
moved
from
under
her
so
that
norma
found
herself
ensconced
in
the
chair
and
her
husband
facing
her
from
the
rug
that
was
before
the
little
gas
log
where
mother
gone
downstairs
to
see
how
the
noon
baby
is
norma
said
wolf
without
preamble
did
you
see
chris
liggett
her
colour
flamed
high
but
her
eyes
did
not
waver
yes
we
met
at
sherry
we
had
lunch
together
you
did
meet
by
accident
there
was
desperate
hope
in
wolf
voice
but
norma
would
not
lie
with
her
simple
negative
her
head
drooped
and
she
looked
at
her
locked
fingers
in
silence
wolf
was
silent
too
for
a
long
minute
then
he
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
quietly
and
sensibly
i
been
a
long
time
waking
up
nono
he
said
i
sorry
of
course
i
knew
that
there
was
a
difference
i
knew
that
you
felt
differently
and
i
guessed
that
it
was
chris
norma
do
you
do
you
still
like
him
she
looked
up
wretchedly
nodding
her
head
more
he
began
and
stopped
more
than
you
do
me
he
asked
and
in
the
silence
he
added
suddenly
norma
i
thought
we
were
so
happy
then
the
tears
came
wolf
i
never
love
any
one
more
than
i
do
you
the
girl
said
passionately

an
angel
to
me
always
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
i
know
you
i
know
what
you
are
to
rose
aunt
kate
and
what
the
men
at
the
factory
think
of
you
i
not
fit
to
tie
your
shoes
wicked
and
selfish
and
and
everything
i
ought
to
be
but
i
help
it
i
wanted
you
to
know
all
there
was
to
know
i
met
him
and
we
talked
and
walked
together
that
all
and
that
all
we
want
just
to
be
friends
i
sorry
her
voice
trailed
off
on
a
sob
i
awfully
sorry
she
said
yes
wolf
said
slowly
after
a
pause
i
sorry
too
he
sat
down
rumpling
his
hair
frowning
norma
watching
him
fearfully
noticed
that
he
was
very
pale
i
thought
we
were
so
happy
he
said
again
simply
ah
wolf
do
think
i
been
fooling
all
this
summer
his
wife
pleaded
her
eyes
filling
afresh
i
loved
it
all
the
peach
and
the
picnics
and
everything
but
but
people
ca
help
this
sort
of
thing
can
they
it
does

and
and
they
just
simply

best
of
it
do
they
if
if
we
go
to
california
next
month
you
know
that
i
do
everything
i
can
he
was
not
listening
to
her
norma
he
interrupted
sharply
if
liggett
wife
was
out
of
the
way
would
you
want
to
marry
him
wolf
what
the
use
of
asking
that
you
only
you
only
excite
us
both
aunt
alice
out
of
the
way
and
even
if
she
were
i
am
your
wife
i
sorry
i
never
meet
him
again
i
have
been
a
bit
happy
about
it
i
promise
you
that
i
will
not
see
him
again
i
do
ask
you
for
that
promise
wolf
said
i
do
know
what
we
can
do
i
never
should
have
let
you
i
should
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
but
somehow
i
always
dreamed
that
you
and
i
would
marry
well
he
interrupted
his
musing
with
resolute
cheerfulness
i
got
to
get
over
to
the
library
he
said
for
i
may
have
to
start
for
phily
afternoon
will
you
tell
mother
norma
immediately
protested
that
she
was
going
with
him
but
he
patiently
declined
kissing
her
in
a
sort
of
way
as
he
pulled
on
the
old
overcoat
and
the
new
gloves
and
slamming
the
hall
door
behind
him
when
he
went
for
a
minute
she
stood
looking
after
him
with
a
great
heartache
almost
blinding
her
then
she
flashed
to
her
room
and
before
wolf
had
reached
the
corner
his
wife
had
slipped
her
hand
into
his
arm
and
her
little
double
step
was
keeping
pace
with
his
long
stride
in
the
way
they
both
loved
she
talked
to
him
in
her
usual
manner
and
presently
he
could
answer
normally
and
they
bought
peppermints
to
soften
their
literary
labours
in
the
big
library
wolf
was
instantly
absorbed
but
for
awhile
norma
sat
watching
the
shabby
interested
intelligent
men
and
women
who
came
and
went
the
shabby
books
that
crossed
the
counters
the
pretty
efficient
under
their
green
droplights
the
radiators
clanked
and
hissed
softly
in
the
intervals
of
silence
sometimes
there
was
whispering
at
the
shelves
or
one
of
the
attendants
spoke
in
a
low
tone
norma
loved
the
atmosphere
so
typical
a
phase
of
the
great
life
after
awhile
she
idly
dragged
toward
her
three
books
from
a
table
and
idly
dipped
into
them
the
life
of
the
grimkés
the
life
of
elizabeth
prentiss
the
letters
of
charles
dickens
nine
struck
ten
eleven
wolf
had
some
six
or
seven
large
books
about
him
and
alternated
his
plunges
into
them
with
animated
whispered
conversations
with
a
old
man
two
hours
ago
an
utter
stranger
but
always
henceforth
to
be
affectionately
quoted
by
wolf
as
a
friend
they
indulged
in
the
extravagance
of
a
for
the
home
trip
norma
left
wolf
still
reading
after
winning
from
him
a
kiss
and
a
promise
not
to
worry
and
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
when
she
wakened
after
some
nine
delicious
hours
he
was
gone
gone
to
philadelphia
as
it
proved
breakfasting
at
ten
in
a
flood
of
sweet
winter
sunshine
she
put
a
brave
face
on
the
matter
she
told
herself
that
it
was
better
that
wolf
should
know
and
only
the
part
of
true
kindness
not
to
deny
what
for
good
or
ill
was
true
the
memory
of
his
grave
and
troubled
face
distressed
her
but
she
reminded
herself
that
he
would
be
back
on
saturday
and
then
he
would
have
forgiven
her
she
would
see
chris
and
the
day
after
and
by
that
time
they
would
have
said
everything
that
there
was
to
say
and
they
would
never
see
each
other
again
for
it
was
a
favourite
hallucination
of
theirs
that
every
meeting
was
to
be
the
last
not
said
chris
that
there
was
any
harm
in
it
but
it
was
wiser
not
to
see
each
other
and
when
norma
glowing
under
his
eyes
would
echo
this
feeling
he
praised
her
for
her
courage
as
if
they
had
resisted
the
temptation
already
i
thought
it
all
over
chris
she
would
say
and
i
know
that
the
wisest
way
is
to
stop
and
you
must
help
me
and
when
chris
answered
norma
i
do
see
where
you
get
that
marvellous
courage
of
yours
it
did
not
occur
to
norma
to
question
in
what
way
she
was
showing
courage
at
all
she
lived
upon
his
praise
and
could
not
have
enough
of
it
he
never
tired
of
telling
her
that
she
was
beautiful
good
brave
a
constant
inspiration
and
far
above
the
ordinary
type
of
woman
and
norma
believed
him
on
the
day
before
wolf
first
return
from
philadelphia
chris
was
very
grave
when
he
and
norma
were
halfway
through
their
luncheon
in
the
quiet
angle
of
an
restaurant
he
told
her
why
alice
was
failing
specialists
had
told
him
that
england
was
out
of
the
question
she
might
live
a
year
but
the
probability
was
against
it
they
he
and
norma
chris
said
must
consider
this
now
norma
considered
it
with
a
paling
face
it
it
could
make
any
difference
she
said
quickly
and
nervously
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
talked
to
her
of
her
responsibility
in
the
matter
of
what
their
love
meant
to
them
both
wolf
had
his
claim
true
but
what
was
truly
the
generous
thing
for
a
woman
to
do
toward
a
man
she
did
not
love
was
a
year
or
two
of
hurt
feelings
even
anger
and
resentment
better
than
a
loveless
marriage
that
might
last
fifty
years
this
was
a
terrible
problem
and
norma
did
not
know
what
to
think
on
the
one
hand
was
the
certainty
of
that
higher
life
from
which
she
had
been
exiled
since
her
marriage
the
music
the
art
the
letters
the
cultivated
voices
and
fragrant
rooms
the
wealth
and
luxury
the
devotion
of
this
remarkable
and
charming
man
whose
simple
friendship
had
been
beyond
her
dreams
a
few
years
ago
on
the
other
side
was
the
painful
and
indeed
shameful
desertion
of
wolf
the
rupture
with
aunt
kate
and
rose
and
the
undying
sense
in
her
own
soul
of
an
unworthy
action
but
rose
was
absorbed
in
harry
and
the
children
and
aunt
kate
would
surely
go
with
wolf
to
california
three
thousand
miles
away
i
am
not
brave
enough
she
whispered
you
brave
enough
chris
answered
quickly
tell
him
the
truth
as
you
did
on
your
wedding
day
tell
him
you
acted
on
a
mad
impulse
and
that
you
are
sorry
a
few
days
discomfort
and
you
are
free
and
one
week
of
happiness
will
blot
out
the
whole
wretched
memory
for
ever
it
is
not
wretchedness
chris
she
corrected
with
a
rueful
smile
but
she
did
not
contradict
him
and
before
they
parted
she
promised
him
that
she
would
not
go
to
california
without
at
least
telling
wolf
how
she
felt
about
it
rose
and
harry
joined
them
for
the
saturday
night
reunion
norma
thought
that
wolf
seemed
moody
and
was
unresponsive
to
her
generous
welcome
and
she
was
conscious
of
watching
him
somewhat
apprehensively
as
the
evening
wore
on
but
it
was
sunday
afternoon
before
the
storm
broke
wolf
was
at
church
when
norma
wakened
and
as
she
dressed
she
meditated
a
trifle
uneasily
over
this
departure
from
their
usual
comfortable
sunday
morning
habit
she
breakfasted
alone
wolf
and
his
mother
coming
in
for
their
belated
coffee
just
as
norma
prettily
coated
and
hatted
and
furred
was
leaving
the
house
for
the
mass
they
did
not
meet
again
until
luncheon
and
as
wolf
had
explained
that
he
must
leave
at
four
for
philadelphia
norma
began
to
think
that
this
particular
visit
would
end
without
any
definite
unpleasantness
however
at
about
three
he
invited
her
to
walk
with
him
to
the
station
and
join
his
mother
later
at
rose
house
in
new
jersey
and
norma
dared
not
refuse
they
locked
the
apartment
and
walked
slowly
down
broadway
as
they
had
walked
so
many
thousand
times
before
in
the
streaming
sunday
crowds
before
they
had
gone
a
block
wolf
opened
hostilities
by
asking
abruptly
where
did
you
go
to
church
this
morning
norma
flushed
and
laughed
a
little
i
went
down
to
the
cathedral
i
fond
of
it
you
know
why
did
you
meet
chris
liggett
wolf
asked
yes
i
did
wolf
he
goes
to
the
church
near
there
now
and
then
when
you
telephone
him
to
wolf
said
grimly
norma
began
to
feel
frightened
she
had
never
heard
this
tone
from
wolf
before
i
did
telephone
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
rather
he
happened
to
telephone
me
and
i
said
i
was
going
there
is
there
anything
so
horrifying
in
that
she
asked
just
after
you
went
out
the
telephone
operator
asked
me
if
the
murray
hill
number
had
gotten
us
wolf
answered
that
how
i
happen
to
know
norma
was
angry
ashamed
and
afraid
all
at
once
for
twenty
feet
they
walked
in
silence
she
stole
more
than
one
anxious
look
at
her
companion
wolf
face
was
set
like
flint
he
was
buttoned
into
the
familiar
old
overcoat
a
tall
brown
and
just
now
scowling
young
man
of
the
accepted
american
type
firm
of
jaw
keen
of
eye
and
with
a
somewhat
homely
bluntness
of
feature
preventing
him
from
being
describable
as
handsome
or
with
at
best
a
rough
hard
sort
of
handsomeness
that
was
as
unconscious
of
itself
as
the
beauty
of
a
young
animal
wolf
do
be
cross
his
wife
pleaded
in
illogical
coaxing
i
not
cross
he
said
with
an
annoyed
glance
that
humiliated
and
angered
her
but
i
do
like
this
sort
of
thing
norma
and
i
should
think
you
know
why
what
sort
of
thing
norma
countered
quickly
the
sort
of
thing
that
evidently
christopher
liggett
thinks
is
fair
play
wolf
said
with
youthful
bitterness
harry
saw
you
both
walking
up
fifth
avenue
yesterday
and
joe
anderson
happened
to
mention
that
you
and
a
man
were
lunching
together
on
thursday
down
at
the
lafayette
there
may
be
no
harm
in
it
there
be
norma
echoed
firing
you
know
very
well
there
you
see
him
every
day
wolf
said
i
see
him
every
day
but
if
i
did
it
would
be
harry
redding
and
joe
anderson
business
no
wolf
said
more
mildly
but
it
might
be
mine
norma
realized
that
he
was
softening
under
her
distress
and
she
changed
her
tone
wolf
you
know
that
you
can
trust
me
she
said
but
i
do
know
anything
about
him
wolf
reminded
her
i
know
that
he
twice
your
age
he
then
and
i
know
that
he
a
loafer
a
rich
man
who
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
run
around
with
women
i
want
to
ask
you
to
stop
talking
about
something
of
which
you
are
entirely
ignorant
norma
interrupted
hotly
you
the
one
that
ignorant
norma
wolf
said
stubbornly
not
looking
at
her
you
are
only
a
little
girl
you
think
it
great
fun
to
be
married
to
one
man
and
flirting
with
another
what
makes
me
sick
is
that
a
man
like
liggett
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
and
you
women
if
you
say
that
again
i
not
walk
with
you
norma
burst
in
furiously
does
it
ever
occur
to
you
wolf
asked
equally
roused
that
you
are
my
wife
yes
norma
answered
breathlessly
yes
it
does
and
why
because
i
was
afraid
i
was
beginning
to
care
too
much
for
chris
liggett
because
i
knew
he
loved
me
he
had
told
me
so
and
i
went
to
you
because
i
wanted
to
be
safe
and
i
told
you
so
too
wolf
sheridan
the
very
day
that
we
were
married
i
never
lied
to
you
i
told
you
i
loved
chris
that
i
always
had
and
if
you
been
to
me
rushed
on
norma
beginning
to
feel
tears
mastering
her
if
you
been
to
me
i
would
have
gotten
over
it
i
would
never
have
seen
him
again
anyway
after
this
week
for
i
told
him
this
morning
that
i
did
want
to
go
on
meeting
him
that
it
was
fair
to
you
but
no
you
do
trust
me
and
you
do
believe
me
and
consequently
consequently
i
do
care
what
i
do
and
i
make
you
sorry
do
talk
so
wildly
norma
wolf
warned
her
in
a
tone
suddenly
quiet
and
sad
please
do
people
will
notice
you
i
do
care
if
they
do
norma
said
but
she
glanced
about
deserted
eighth
avenue
uneasily
none
the
less
and
furtively
dried
her
eyes
upon
a
flimsy
little
transparent
handkerchief
that
somehow
tore
at
her
husband
heart
if
you
had
been
a
little
patient
wolf
she
pleaded
reproachfully
there
are
times
when
a
man
has
much
use
for
patience
norma
wolf
said
still
with
strange
gentleness
you
tell
me
of
liking
liggett
but
i
thought
i
hoped
i
guess
he
paused
and
then
went
on
with
sudden
fierceness
he
married
norma
and
you
married
i
wish
there
was
some
way
of
letting
you
out
of
it
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
of
course
you
do
have
to
go
to
california
with
me
if
that
helps
you
can
get
your
freedom
easily
enough
after
awhile
but
as
long
as
he
tied
it
does
seem
to
me
that
he
has
any
business
his
gentle
tone
disarmed
her
and
she
took
up
chris
defence
eagerly
wolf
do
you
believe
there
is
such
a
thing
as
love
just
that
two
people
find
out
that
they
belong
to
each
other
whether
it
right
or
wrong
or
possible
or
impossible
and
that
it
may
last
for
ever
no
said
wolf
harshly
i
do
believe
it
he
married
does
he
love
his
wife
well
of
course
he
loves
her
but
this
is
the
first
time
in
all
his
life
that
he
has
cared
this
way
norma
said
wolf
made
no
answer
and
she
felt
that
she
had
scored
they
were
in
the
station
now
and
weaving
their
way
down
toward
the
big
concourse
norma
took
her
husband
arm
please
please
do
make
scenes
wolf
if
you
will
just
believe
me
that
i
would
truly
i
would
hurt
you
and
aunt
kate
for
all
the
world
ah
norma
he
said
quickly
i
ca
take
my
wife
on
those
terms
and
turning
from
the
ticket
window
he
added
sensibly
liggett
is
tied
of
course
but
would
you
like
me
to
leave
you
here
when
i
go
west
until
you
are
surer
of
yourself
one
way
or
another
you
only
have
to
say
so
she
only
had
to
say
so
he
had
reached
of
his
own
accord
the
very
point
to
which
she
long
had
hoped
to
bring
him
but
perversely
norma
did
not
quite
like
to
have
wolf
go
off
to
philadelphia
with
this
unpalatable
affirmative
ringing
in
his
ears
she
looked
down
a
courage
now
and
she
would
win
everything
and
more
than
everything
to
which
chris
had
ever
urged
her
but
she
felt
oddly
sad
and
even
hurt
by
his
willingness
to
give
her
her
way
all
right
he
said
hastily
that
understood
i
tell
mother
i
do
want
you
to
follow
for
awhile
norma
you
taking
the
next
tube
wait
a
minute
i
want
a
was
he
trying
to
show
her
how
mean
he
could
be
she
thought
as
with
a
heartache
and
a
confused
sense
of
wrong
and
distress
she
slowly
went
upon
her
way
of
course
that
parting
was
just
bravado
of
course
he
felt
more
than
that
she
resented
it
she
thought
he
had
been
unnecessarily
unkind
but
her
spirits
slowly
settled
themselves
wolf
knew
what
she
felt
now
and
they
had
really
parted
without
bitterness
a
pleasant
sense
of
being
her
own
mistress
crept
over
her
her
cheeks
cooled
her
fluttering
heart
came
back
to
its
normal
beat
she
began
to
hear
herself
telling
chris
how
courageous
she
had
been
it
was
too
bad
it
was
one
of
the
sad
things
of
life
but
after
all
love
was
love
in
spite
of
wolf
scepticism
and
if
it
soothed
wolf
to
be
rude
let
him
have
that
consolation
what
did
a
little
pain
more
or
less
signify
now
there
was
no
going
back
years
from
now
wolf
would
forgive
her
recognizing
that
great
love
was
its
own
excuse
for
being
and
if
this
sort
of
thing
exists
only
to
be
crushed
and
killed
norma
wrote
chris
a
few
days
later
then
half
the
great
pictures
the
great
novels
the
great
poems
and
dramas
the
great
operas
are
lies
but
you
and
i
know
that
they
are
not
lies
she
was
unhappy
at
home
for
aunt
kate
was
grave
and
silent
rose
wrapped
in
the
question
of
the
tiny
catherine
meals
and
wolf
neither
came
nor
wrote
on
saturday
night
but
in
chris
devotion
she
was
feverishly
and
breathlessly
happy
their
meetings
always
in
public
places
and
without
a
visible
evidence
of
their
emotion
were
hours
of
the
most
stimulating
delight
chapter
xxx
so
matters
went
on
for
another
ten
days
then
suddenly
on
a
afternoon
norma
walking
home
from
a
luncheon
in
a
wild
and
stormy
wind
was
amazed
to
see
the
familiar
roadster
waiting
outside
her
aunt
door
when
she
reached
the
steps
chris
jumped
out
and
came
to
meet
her
as
she
looked
bewilderedly
toward
it
a
chris
curiously
different
in
manner
from
the
man
she
had
left
only
an
hour
ago
norma
he
said
quickly
i
found
a
message
when
i
got
to
the
office
i
was
to
call
up
aunt
marianna
house
at
once
she
ill
ill
they
want
me
and
they
want
you
me
she
echoed
blankly
what
for
she
had
a
stroke
he
said
still
with
that
urgent
and
hurried
air
and
joseph
poor
old
fellow
he
was
completely
broken
up
said
that
she
had
been
begging
them
to
get
hold
of
you
norma
had
gotten
into
the
familiar
front
seat
but
now
she
stayed
him
with
a
quick
hand
wait
a
minute
chris
i
run
up
and
tell
aunt
kate
where
i
am
going
she
said
she
gone
out
there
nobody
there
he
assured
her
glancing
up
at
the
apartment
windows
i
knew
you
would
be
coming
in
so
i
waited
then
i
telephone
the
girl
said
settling
herself
again
but
what
do
you
suppose
she
wants
me
for
she
asked
returning
to
the
subject
of
the
summons
have
they
will
they
send
for
aunt
annie
and
leslie
do
you
suppose
leslie
is
in
florida
with
the
binneys
most
unfortunately
annie
was
in
baltimore
yesterday
but
i
believe
she
was
expected
home
joseph
said
he
had
gotten
hold
of
hendrick
von
behrens
and
i
told
my
clerk
to
get
acton
and
to
warn
miss
slater
that
alice
is
to
be
frightened
but
chris
do
you
suppose
she
is
dying
i
do
know
one
never
does
of
course
with
paralysis
poor
aunt
alice
it
will
almost
kill
her
yes
it
will
be
terribly
hard
for
her
harder
than
for
any
one
he
answered
and
norma
loved
him
for
the
grave
sympathy
that
filled
his
voice
and
for
the
poise
that
could
make
such
a
speech
possible
under
the
circumstances
without
ever
a
side
glance
for
her
then
they
reached
the
old
house
ran
up
the
steps
and
were
in
the
great
dark
hallway
that
already
seemed
to
be
filled
with
the
shadow
of
change
whispering
maids
went
to
and
fro
joseph
was
the
heavy
fur
coats
of
two
doctors
were
flung
upon
chairs
norma
slipped
from
her
own
coat
how
is
she
joseph
i
hardly
know
miss
you
to
go
up
please
and
regina
was
to
tell
one
of
the
nurses
at
once
that
you
had
come
miss
he
delivered
his
message
impassively
enough
but
then
the
human
note
must
break
through
i
been
with
her
since
she
was
married
miss
nigh
forty
years
the
old
man
faltered
and
i
afraid
she
is
very
bad
very
bad
indeed
oh
i
not
norma
went
noiselessly
upstairs
chris
close
behind
her
did
she
hope
not
she
hardly
knew
but
she
knew
that
all
this
was
strangely
thrilling
this
rush
through
the
tossing
windy
afternoon
to
the
old
house
this
sense
of
being
a
part
of
the
emergency
this
utter
departure
from
the
tedious
routine
of
life
a
nurse
took
charge
of
them
and
she
and
chris
followed
her
noiselessly
into
the
familiar
bedroom
that
yet
looked
so
altered
in
its
new
lifeless
order
and
emptiness
the
clutter
of
personal
possessions
was
already
gone
chairs
had
been
straightened
and
pushed
back
and
on
the
bed
that
had
lately
been
frilled
and
embroidered
in
white
and
pink
and
piled
with
foolish
little
transparent
baby
pillows
a
fresh
flawless
linen
sheet
was
spread
silence
reigned
in
the
wide
chamber
but
two
doctors
were
standing
by
the
window
and
looked
at
the
newcomers
with
interest
and
a
second
nurse
passed
them
on
her
way
out
norma
vaguely
noted
the
fire
burning
clear
and
bright
the
shaded
light
that
showed
a
chart
on
a
cleared
table
the
absence
of
flowers
and
plants
that
made
the
place
seem
bare
but
after
one
general
impression
her
attention
was
riveted
upon
the
sick
woman
and
with
her
heart
beating
quickly
with
fright
she
went
to
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
great
walnut
bed
melrose
was
lying
with
her
head
tipped
back
in
pillows
her
usually
gentle
soft
old
face
looked
hard
and
lined
and
was
a
dark
red
and
the
scanty
gray
hair
brushed
back
mercilessly
from
the
temples
and
devoid
of
the
usual
puffs
and
transformations
made
her
look
her
full
sixty
years
her
eyes
were
but
she
did
not
move
them
her
lips
seemed
very
dry
and
occasionally
she
muttered
restlessly
and
a
third
nurse
bending
above
her
leaned
anxiously
near
to
catch
what
she
said
and
perhaps
murmur
a
soothing
response
this
nurse
looked
sharply
at
norma
and
breathed
rather
than
whispered
mrs
sheridan
and
when
norma
answered
with
a
nod
nodded
herself
in
satisfaction
she
been
asking
and
asking
for
you
she
said
in
a
low
clear
tone
that
oddly
broke
the
unnatural
silence
of
the
room
norma
hearing
a
stir
behind
her
looked
back
to
see
that
both
doctors
had
come
over
to
the
bed
and
were
looking
down
at
their
patient
with
a
profound
concern
that
their
gray
heads
and
their
big
spectacles
oddly
emphasized
mrs
sheridan
one
of
them
questioned
norma
dared
not
use
her
voice
and
nodded
again
immediately
the
doctor
leaned
over
melrose
and
said
in
a
clear
and
encouraging
tone
here
is
sheridan
now
melrose
merely
moaned
heavily
in
answer
and
norma
said
softly
to
the
doctor
who
had
spoken
i
think
perhaps
she
was
asking
for
my
aunt
who
is
also
mrs
sheridan
before
the
doctor
gravely
considering
could
answer
the
sick
woman
startled
them
all
by
saying
almost
fretfully
in
a
surprisingly
clear
and
quiet
voice
no
no
no
i
want
you
norma
she
groped
blindly
about
with
her
hand
as
she
spoke
and
norma
kneeled
down
and
covered
it
with
both
her
own
melrose
immediately
began
to
breathe
more
easily
and
sank
at
once
into
the
stupor
from
which
she
had
only
momentarily
roused
norma
looked
for
instruction
to
the
doctor
who
presently
decided
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
gained
for
a
time
she
joined
them
presently
with
chris
in
the
adjoining
room
this
was
the
same
old
room
of
her
first
visit
to
the
house
with
the
same
rich
old
brocaded
paper
and
fringed
rep
draperies
with
the
same
pictures
and
a
few
new
ones
lined
on
the
mantel
where
are
von
behrens
and
leslie
doctor
murray
who
had
known
all
the
family
intimately
for
years
asked
chris
is
it
so
serious
doctor
christopher
asked
in
turn
when
he
had
answered
the
doctor
glancing
toward
the
closed
door
nodded
gravely
a
matter
of
a
day
or
two
he
said
looking
at
the
other
old
doctor
for
confirmation
she
was
apparently
perfectly
normal
last
night
went
to
bed
at
her
usual
hour
he
said
this
morning
she
complained
of
her
head
when
the
maid
went
in
at
ten
said
that
she
must
have
hurt
it
struck
it
against
something
the
maid
a
sensible
young
woman
was
uneasy
and
telephoned
for
me
unfortunately
i
was
in
westchester
this
morning
but
i
got
here
at
about
one
and
found
her
as
she
is
now
she
has
had
a
stroke
probably
several
slight
shocks
why
but
she
was
perfectly
well
day
before
yesterday
norma
said
in
amazement
and
only
ten
days
ago
she
came
back
from
florida
and
said
that
she
never
felt
better
that
is
frequently
the
history
of
the
disease
the
second
doctor
said
sagely
and
glancing
at
his
watch
he
added
i
do
think
you
will
need
me
again
doctor
murray
what
are
the
chances
of
her
knowing
anybody
chris
asked
she
may
very
probably
have
another
lucid
interval
doctor
murray
said
if
sheridan
could
arrange
to
stay
it
would
be
advisable
she
asked
for
her
daughters
but
she
seemed
even
more
anxious
that
we
should
send
for
he
glanced
at
norma
with
a
little
bow
sheridan
could
stay
of
course
she
would
telephone
home
and
advise
aunt
kate
at
once
indeed
so
keen
was
norma
sense
almost
of
enjoyment
in
this
thrilling
hour
that
she
would
have
been
extremely
sorry
to
leave
the
house
it
was
sad
it
was
dreadful
of
course
to
think
that
poor
old
aunt
marianna
was
so
ill
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
most
dramatic
she
and
chris
settled
themselves
before
the
fire
in
the
upstairs
with
doctor
murray
who
entertained
them
with
mild
reminiscences
of
the
civil
war
the
storm
was
upon
the
city
now
rain
slashed
at
the
windows
and
the
wind
howled
bitterly
there
was
whispering
in
the
old
house
quiet
footsteps
muffled
voices
at
the
door
and
telephone
at
about
six
chris
went
home
to
tell
alice
with
what
tenderness
he
might
of
the
impending
sorrow
regina
who
had
been
weeping
bitterly
and
would
speak
to
no
one
brought
norma
and
the
doctor
two
smoking
hot
cups
of
bouillon
on
a
tray
and
you
must
get
tired
sheridan
one
of
the
nurses
herself
healthily
odorous
of
a
beef
and
dinner
said
kindly
to
norma
at
about
seven
there
be
coffee
and
sandwiches
all
night
this
is
a
part
of
our
lives
you
know
and
we
get
used
to
it
but
hard
for
those
not
accustomed
to
it
at
about
nine
in
the
evening
chris
came
back
alice
had
received
the
news
bravely
he
said
there
had
been
no
hysteria
and
she
kept
admirable
control
of
herself
and
he
had
left
her
ready
for
sleep
but
it
had
hit
her
very
hard
miss
slater
had
promised
him
that
she
would
put
a
sleeping
powder
into
alice
regular
ten
glass
of
hot
milk
and
let
him
know
when
she
was
safely
off
she
is
very
thankful
that
you
are
here
she
was
uneasy
every
instant
that
i
stayed
away
he
said
softly
to
norma
and
norma
nodded
her
approval
long
before
eleven
they
had
the
report
that
alice
was
sleeping
soundly
under
the
combined
effect
of
the
powder
and
miss
slater
repeated
and
earnest
assurance
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
as
regarded
her
mother
chris
and
norma
and
the
doctor
and
two
of
the
nurses
went
down
to
the
and
had
sandwiches
and
coffee
and
talked
long
and
sadly
of
the
briefness
and
mutability
of
mortal
life
when
they
went
upstairs
again
the
doctor
stretched
out
for
some
rest
on
the
couch
and
norma
went
to
her
own
old
room
and
got
into
her
comfortable
thick
padded
wrapper
and
warm
slippers
the
night
was
still
wet
and
stormy
and
had
turned
cold
hail
rattled
on
the
window
sills
then
she
crept
into
the
and
joined
the
nurses
in
their
unrelenting
vigil
melrose
was
still
lying
back
her
eyes
her
face
darkly
flushed
her
lips
moving
in
an
incoherent
mutter
now
and
then
they
caught
the
syllables
of
norma
name
and
once
she
said
kate
so
sharply
that
everyone
in
the
sick
chamber
started
norma
leaning
back
in
a
great
chair
by
the
bed
mused
and
pondered
as
the
slow
hours
went
by
the
softened
lights
touched
the
nurses
crisp
aprons
the
fire
was
out
now
and
only
the
two
softly
palpitating
disks
from
the
shaded
lamps
dimly
illumined
the
room
annie
and
theodore
and
alice
had
all
been
born
in
this
very
room
norma
thought
she
imagined
aunt
marianna
a
handsome
stout
radiant
young
woman
in
the
bustles
and
pleats
of
the
early
eighties
with
the
flowing
ruffles
of
theodore
christening
robe
spreading
over
her
lap
how
wonderful
life
must
have
seemed
to
her
then
rich
and
young
and
adored
by
her
husband
and
with
her
child
receiving
all
the
homage
due
the
heir
of
the
great
name
and
fortune
then
came
annie
and
some
years
later
alice
and
how
busy
and
happy
their
mother
must
have
been
with
plenty
of
money
for
schools
and
frocks
trips
to
the
country
with
her
handsome
imperious
children
trips
to
europe
when
no
desire
need
be
denied
them
all
the
world
the
playground
for
the
fortunate
melroses
how
short
the
perspective
must
look
now
thought
norma
to
that
troubled
brain
that
was
struggling
among
closing
shadows
nearer
and
nearer
every
slow
clocktick
to
the
end
how
loathsome
it
must
be
to
the
prisoned
spirit
this
handsome
stifling
room
this
army
of
maids
and
nurses
and
doctors
so
decorously
resigned
to
facing
the
last
scene
of
all
why
the
poorest
child
in
the
city
healthily
asleep
in
some
unspeakable
makeshift
for
a
bed
possessed
what
all
the
melrose
money
could
not
buy
for
this
moaning
suffocating
old
autocrat
i
should
like
to
die
out
on
a
hillside
under
the
stars
thought
norma
with
no
one
to
watch
me
this
is
somehow
so
horrible
and
she
crept
toward
the
bed
and
slipped
to
her
knees
again
forcing
herself
against
her
inclination
for
somehow
prayers
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
scene
to
pray
for
the
departing
soul
norma
the
old
lady
said
suddenly
opening
her
eyes
she
looked
quietly
and
intelligently
at
the
girl
yes
dear
norma
stammered
with
a
frightened
glance
toward
the
nurses
these
were
instantly
intent
at
the
bedside
but
melrose
paid
no
attention
to
them
she
patted
norma
hand
late
for
you
dear
she
whispered
night
obediently
she
drank
something
the
nurse
put
to
her
lips
and
when
she
spoke
it
was
more
clearly
a
moment
later
doctor
murray
had
her
pulse
between
his
nerveless
fingers
she
moved
her
eyes
lazily
to
smile
at
him
tide
running
out
old
friend
she
said
in
a
deep
rich
voice
the
doctor
smiled
shaking
his
head
but
norma
saw
his
eyes
glisten
behind
his
glasses
suddenly
melrose
frowned
and
began
to
show
excitement
norma
she
said
quickly
i
want
chris
right
here
aunt
marianna
norma
answered
soothingly
and
chris
was
indeed
leaning
over
the
bed
almost
before
she
finished
speaking
i
want
to
talk
to
you
and
chris
the
old
lady
said
contentedly
closing
her
eyes
everybody
else
out
she
whispered
the
room
was
immediately
cleared
it
ca
hurt
her
now
doctor
murray
looked
rather
than
said
to
norma
as
he
passed
her
chris
watched
the
closing
doors
sat
beside
the
bed
head
with
one
arm
his
pillows
we
all
alone
aunt
marianna
he
said
leslie
and
annie
will
be
here
in
the
morning
and
alice
told
me
to
tell
you
that
she
hoped
chris
the
sick
woman
interrupted
gazing
at
him
with
an
intense
and
painful
stare
this
child
here
norma
i
i
must
straighten
it
all
out
now
chris
kate
knows
kate
has
all
the
papers
letters
letters
ask
kate
she
shut
her
eyes
norma
and
chris
looked
at
one
another
in
bewilderment
there
was
a
long
silence
so
now
you
know
melrose
said
presently
returning
to
full
consciousness
as
naturally
as
she
had
before
i
told
you
did
i
she
asked
faintly
anxious
do
bother
now
aunt
marianna
the
girl
begged
in
distress
louison
melrose
said
was
annie
french
maid
very
superior
girl
i
remember
her
theodore
wife
chris
said
eager
to
help
her
and
she
was
this
girl
mother
melrose
added
clasping
fingers
you
understand
that
chris
yes
darling
we
understand
norma
said
with
a
nod
to
chris
that
he
was
to
humour
her
but
chris
looked
only
strangely
troubled
annie
poor
baby
lived
kate
brought
it
home
from
france
and
we
named
it
leslie
the
invalid
said
clearly
i
could
i
could
forget
it
chris
i
used
to
go
see
it
at
kate
and
then
when
it
was
three
i
met
louison
poor
girl
i
had
been
cruel
to
her
and
theodore
was
far
off
in
california
dying
we
knew
and
i
met
louison
in
brooklyn
and
i
had
a
sudden
idea
chris
i
told
her
to
go
to
kate
and
get
baby
and
bring
it
to
me
as
if
it
was
her
own
i
told
her
to
i
told
her
to
say
that
it
was
her
baby
theodore
baby
and
she
did
chris
and
i
paid
her
well
for
it
she
brought
leslie
here
and
annie
never
knew
nobody
ever
knew
but
i
never
knew
that
louison
had
a
baby
of
her
own
chris
i
never
knew
that
louison
hated
me
and
she
never
told
me
she
had
a
little
girl
no
no
no
i
never
knew
that
then
leslie
is
annie
child
by
müller
the
riding
master
chris
whispered
staring
blindly
ahead
of
him
and
what
what
became
of
the
other
child
theodore
child
louison
kept
her
until
she
was
five
the
old
lady
explained
eagerly
and
then
she
wanted
to
marry
again
and
she
had
to
go
live
in
a
wild
sort
of
place
in
canada
she
did
want
to
take
the
little
girl
there
and
she
remembered
kate
sheridan
who
had
had
the
other
baby
and
who
had
been
so
good
to
it
so
devoted
to
it
and
she
went
there
chris
and
left
her
baby
there
and
that
baby
chris
began
yes
that
was
norma
melrose
said
it
is
all
norma
the
whole
thing
and
you
must
take
care
that
she
gets
it
chris
i
even
my
will
dear
only
gives
norma
the
melrose
building
and
some
bonds
but
those
are
for
leslie
now
all
the
rest
the
whole
estate
goes
to
child
norma
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
did
it
all
wrong
i
meant
it
for
the
best
i
never
knew
that
you
were
living
dear
until
kate
brought
you
here
three
years
ago
she
did
dare
do
it
until
your
mother
died
she
had
promised
she
would
never
tell
a
living
soul
but
louison
softened
toward
the
end
and
wrote
kate
she
must
use
her
own
judgment
and
kate
kate
knows
all
about
it
the
voice
thickened
the
old
lady
raised
herself
in
bed
that
man
behind
you
chris
she
gasped
chris
put
her
down
again
norma
flew
for
help
the
muttering
and
the
heavy
breathing
recommenced
nurses
and
doctors
ran
back
regina
came
to
kneel
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
another
slight
stroke
they
said
later
when
they
were
all
about
the
fire
in
the
next
room
again
norma
was
white
her
eyes
glittering
her
bitten
lips
scarlet
in
her
colourless
face
chris
looked
stunned
but
he
found
time
for
just
one
aside
as
the
endless
night
wore
on
annie
had
arrived
superbly
horrified
and
stricken
and
acton
was
there
melrose
was
still
breathing
the
sickly
light
of
a
winter
morning
was
tugging
at
the
shutters
norma
chris
said
do
you
realize
what
a
tremendous
thing
has
happened
to
you
do
you
realize
who
you
are
you
are
a
rich
woman
now
my
dear
but
do
you
believe
it
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
know
it
is
true
it
explains
everything
he
answered
it
will
be
a
cruel
blow
to
leslie
poor
child
and
annie
too
alice
i
think
need
never
know
but
norma
even
though
this
does
seem
the
time
or
the
place
let
me
be
the
first
to
congratulate
you
on
your
new
position
my
old
friend
theodore
daughter
and
the
last
of
the
melroses
at
seven
in
the
morning
norma
exhausted
with
excitement
and
emotion
took
a
hot
bath
and
finding
things
unchanged
in
the
except
that
the
lights
had
been
extinguished
and
the
winter
daylight
was
drearily
mingling
with
firelight
went
on
downstairs
for
coffee
and
for
one
more
conference
with
the
blinking
nurses
and
the
tired
old
doctor
she
found
herself
too
shaken
to
eat
but
the
hot
drink
was
wonderfully
soothing
and
stimulating
and
for
the
first
time
as
she
stood
looking
out
into
the
street
from
the
window
a
sense
of
power
and
pride
began
to
thrill
her
old
people
must
die
of
course
and
after
this
sad
and
dark
scene
was
over
then
what
then
what
then
she
would
be
in
leslie
place
the
heiress
the
important
figure
among
all
the
changes
that
followed
if
you
please
mrs
sheridan
it
was
joseph
haggard
and
white
who
had
come
softly
behind
her
to
interrupt
her
thoughts
she
glanced
with
quick
apprehension
toward
the
hall
stairway
there
had
been
a
change
no
it
was
the
telephone
miss
norma
puzzled
by
the
old
stricken
air
went
to
the
instrument
it
was
miss
slater
norma
miss
slater
said
agitatedly
is
mr
liggett
there
i
think
he
with
aunt
annie
upstairs
but
he
going
home
about
eight
norma
answered
there
is
no
change
is
aunt
alice
awake
liggett
wanted
to
be
there
when
she
woke
no
she
not
awake
the
other
woman
voice
said
solemnly
she
went
to
sleep
like
a
child
last
night
norma
but
about
half
an
hour
ago
i
went
in
she
had
called
me
it
was
just
instinct
i
suppose
she
was
lying
had
changed
her
position
even
that
norma
cried
in
a
whisper
that
was
like
a
scream
the
grave
voice
and
the
sudden
break
of
tears
chilled
her
to
the
soul
we
had
doctor
merrill
here
miss
slater
said
norma
you
have
to
tell
him
god
help
us
all
she
gone
chapter
xxxi
melrose
never
spoke
again
or
showed
another
flicker
of
the
clear
and
normal
intelligence
that
she
had
shown
in
the
night
but
she
still
breathed
and
the
long
wet
day
dragged
slowly
in
the
big
mournful
old
house
until
late
in
the
unnatural
afternoon
people
all
sorts
of
people
were
coming
and
going
now
and
being
answered
or
being
turned
away
a
few
privileged
old
friends
came
softly
up
the
carpeted
stairs
and
cried
quietly
with
annie
who
looked
unbelievably
old
and
ashen
under
the
double
shock
norma
began
to
hear
on
all
sides
respectful
and
sympathetic
references
to
the
family
the
family
felt
this
and
would
like
that
the
family
was
not
seeing
any
one
the
family
must
be
protected
and
considered
in
every
way
the
privileged
old
friends
talked
with
strange
men
in
the
lower
hall
and
were
heard
saying
i
suppose
so
dubiously
to
questions
of
hats
and
veils
and
carriages
and
the
church
chris
was
gone
all
day
but
at
four
an
urgent
message
was
sent
him
and
he
and
acton
came
into
melrose
room
about
half
an
hour
later
for
the
end
his
face
was
ghastly
and
he
seemed
almost
unable
to
understand
what
was
said
to
him
but
he
was
very
quiet
norma
never
forgot
the
scene
she
knelt
on
one
side
of
the
bed
praying
with
all
the
concentration
and
fervour
that
she
could
rally
under
the
circumstances
but
her
frightened
tired
eyes
were
impressed
with
every
detail
of
the
dark
old
stately
bedroom
none
the
less
this
was
the
end
of
the
road
for
youth
and
beauty
and
power
and
wealth
this
sunken
unrecognizable
face
this
gathering
of
shadows
among
the
dull
wintry
shadows
of
the
afternoon
annie
was
kneeling
too
her
fine
unringed
hands
clasping
one
of
her
mother
hands
chris
sat
against
the
back
of
the
bed
the
piled
pillows
in
a
futile
attempt
to
make
more
easy
the
fighting
breath
and
acton
and
hendrick
von
behrens
grave
and
awed
stood
beside
him
their
faces
full
of
sympathy
and
distress
there
was
an
outer
fringe
of
nurses
doctors
maids
there
was
even
an
audible
whisper
from
one
of
them
that
caused
annie
to
frown
annoyed
and
rebuking
over
her
shoulder
minutes
passed
norma
pressing
her
cheek
against
the
hand
she
held
began
a
litany
very
low
suddenly
the
dying
woman
opened
her
eyes
yes
yes
yes
she
whispered
eagerly
and
with
a
break
in
her
frightened
voice
norma
began
more
clearly
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
and
they
all
joined
in
somewhat
awkwardly
and
uncertainly
melrose
sank
back
she
had
raised
herself
just
a
fraction
of
an
inch
to
speak
now
her
head
fell
and
norma
saw
the
florid
colour
drain
from
her
face
as
wine
drains
from
an
overturned
glass
a
leaden
pallor
settled
suddenly
upon
her
when
the
prayer
was
finished
they
waited
eyed
each
other
waited
again
there
was
no
other
breath
doctor
annie
cried
choking
the
doctor
gently
laid
down
the
limp
hand
he
had
raised
it
was
already
cool
and
behind
him
the
maids
began
to
sob
and
wail
unrebuked
norma
went
out
into
the
hall
dazed
and
shaken
this
was
her
first
sight
of
death
it
made
her
feel
a
little
faint
and
sick
chris
came
and
talked
to
her
for
a
few
minutes
annie
had
collapsed
utterly
and
was
under
the
doctor
care
acton
broke
down
too
and
norma
heard
chris
attempting
to
quiet
him
there
was
audible
sobbing
all
over
the
house
when
an
hour
or
two
later
alice
beautiful
body
in
a
magnificent
casket
was
brought
to
lie
in
the
old
home
beside
the
mother
she
had
adored
the
fragrance
of
masses
and
masses
of
damp
flowers
began
to
penetrate
everywhere
and
norma
made
occasional
pilgrimages
in
to
annie
bedside
and
told
her
what
beautiful
offerings
were
coming
and
coming
and
coming
joseph
had
reinforcements
of
sympathetic
young
men
who
kept
opening
the
front
door
and
murmuring
at
the
muffled
telephone
secretary
a
young
woman
about
norma
age
was
detailed
by
hendrick
to
keep
cards
and
messages
straight
for
every
little
courtesy
must
be
acknowledged
on
annie
card
within
a
few
time
and
norma
heard
joseph
telephoning
several
of
the
prominent
florists
that
liggett
had
directed
that
all
flowers
were
to
come
to
the
melrose
house
nothing
was
overlooked
when
norma
went
to
her
room
big
boxes
were
on
the
bed
boxes
that
held
everything
that
was
simple
and
beautiful
in
mourning
plain
charming
frocks
a
smart
long
coat
veils
and
gloves
small
and
elegant
hats
even
handkerchiefs
she
dressed
herself
soberly
yet
not
without
that
mournful
thrill
that
fitness
and
becomingness
lends
to
bereavement
when
she
went
back
to
annie
side
annie
was
in
beautiful
lengths
of
lustreless
crape
too
they
settled
down
to
low
sad
conversation
with
a
few
of
the
privileged
old
friends
chris
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
at
about
six
acton
came
in
to
show
them
a
telegram
from
leslie
flying
homeward
judge
lee
was
hurrying
to
them
from
washington
and
for
a
few
minutes
handsome
bewildered
little
boys
came
in
with
a
governess
and
she
cried
over
them
and
clung
to
them
forlornly
after
a
distracted
in
the
when
she
and
acton
and
annie
secretary
had
soup
and
salad
from
a
sort
of
buffet
meal
that
was
going
on
there
indefinitely
norma
went
upstairs
to
find
that
the
door
to
the
front
upper
closed
for
hours
was
set
ajar
and
to
see
a
vague
mass
of
beautiful
flowers
within
white
and
purple
flowers
and
wreaths
of
shining
dark
round
leaves
with
a
heart
she
stepped
softly
inside
and
went
to
kneel
at
the
nearer
coffin
and
cover
her
face
with
her
shaking
hands
the
thick
sweetness
of
the
wet
leaves
and
blossoms
enveloped
her
candles
were
burning
there
was
no
other
light
two
or
three
other
women
were
in
the
room
catching
their
breath
up
through
their
nostrils
with
little
gasps
pressing
folded
handkerchiefs
against
their
trembling
mouths
letting
fresh
tears
well
from
their
eyes
chris
was
standing
a
few
feet
away
from
the
radiant
sleeper
who
had
been
alice
his
arms
were
folded
his
splendid
dark
gaze
fell
upon
her
with
a
sort
of
sombre
calm
he
seemed
entirely
unconscious
of
the
pitying
and
sorrowful
friends
who
were
moving
noiselessly
to
and
fro
in
the
candlelight
there
was
a
wavering
smile
on
alice
quiet
face
her
broad
forehead
was
unruffled
and
her
mouth
mysteriously
sweet
eyes
fell
upon
a
familiar
black
coat
on
the
kneeling
woman
nearest
her
and
with
a
start
she
recognized
aunt
kate
they
left
the
room
together
a
few
minutes
later
and
norma
led
her
aunt
to
her
own
room
where
they
talked
tenderly
of
the
dead
the
older
woman
was
touched
by
the
slender
little
black
figure
and
badly
shaken
by
the
double
tragedy
and
she
cried
quite
openly
norma
had
regina
send
her
up
some
tea
and
petted
and
fussed
about
her
in
her
little
daughterly
way
i
saw
about
miss
alice
this
morning
but
i
had
no
idea
the
poor
old
lady
sheridan
commented
sadly
well
well
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
here
in
this
very
house
and
they
were
all
young
then
aunt
kate
fell
silent
and
mused
for
a
moment
before
adding
briskly
but
now
will
they
want
you
norma
after
the
funeral
i
mean
wolf
wrote
me
i
do
think
aunt
annie
wants
me
now
norma
said
and
with
a
heightened
colour
she
added
suddenly
but
i
belong
here
now
aunt
kate
i
know
who
i
am
at
last
sheridan
face
did
not
move
but
an
indefinable
tightness
came
about
her
mouth
and
an
indefinable
sharpness
to
her
eyes
she
looked
at
norma
without
speaking
aunt
marianna
told
me
the
girl
said
simply
you
sorry
she
added
quickly
i
can
see
you
are
no
i
would
say
that
baby
but
sheridan
spoke
heavily
and
ended
on
a
sigh
there
was
a
short
silence
then
regina
came
in
with
a
note
for
norma
who
read
it
and
turned
to
her
aunt
it
chris
he
wants
very
much
to
see
you
before
you
go
away
she
said
i
wonder
if
you
would
ask
liggett
to
come
in
here
regina
but
five
minutes
later
when
chris
came
in
he
looked
so
ill
that
she
was
quick
to
spare
him
chris
would
do
you
look
so
tired
i
tired
chris
said
after
quietly
accepting
murmured
condolence
with
his
hand
holding
hers
as
if
he
liked
the
big
sympathetic
woman
but
i
want
this
off
my
mind
before
i
see
judge
lee
you
are
right
sheridan
he
said
with
a
sort
of
boyish
gruffness
not
yet
releasing
her
hands
my
wife
was
an
angel
i
always
knew
it
but
i
wish
i
could
tell
her
so
just
once
more
ah
that
the
very
hardest
thing
about
death
sheridan
said
sitting
down
and
quite
frankly
wiping
from
her
eyes
the
tears
that
sympathy
for
his
sorrow
had
made
spring
again
we
always
want
one
more
hour
but
norma
perhaps
has
told
you
chris
said
in
a
different
tone
told
you
of
the
the
remarkable
talk
we
had
yesterday
with
my
poor
kate
sheridan
nodded
gravely
yes
she
answered
almost
reluctantly
norma
is
theodore
child
i
have
letters
all
their
letters
i
knew
her
mother
that
was
louison
courtot
well
it
was
a
business
but
you
got
the
whole
truth
at
last
i
lost
more
than
one
night
sleep
over
my
share
of
it
liggett
thinking
who
this
child
was
and
whether
i
had
the
right
to
hold
my
tongue
i
was
a
widow
when
i
went
to
germany
with
melrose
she
begged
and
begged
me
to
for
she
was
sick
with
worry
about
miss
annie
miss
annie
had
been
over
there
about
eight
months
and
something
she
written
had
made
her
mother
feel
that
she
was
ill
or
in
trouble
well
i
want
to
leave
my
own
children
but
she
coaxed
me
so
hard
that
i
went
we
sailed
without
cabling
and
went
straight
to
leipsic
and
to
the
dreadful
dreary
pension
that
miss
annie
was
in
a
dismal
lonely
place
she
came
downstairs
to
see
her
mother
and
i
never
forget
the
scream
she
gave
for
she
had
no
warning
poor
child
and
müller
had
taken
all
her
money
and
she
was
well
we
could
see
how
she
was
she
began
laughing
and
crying
and
her
mother
did
too
but
melrose
stopped
after
a
few
minutes
and
we
could
stop
miss
annie
at
all
she
shrieked
and
sobbed
and
strangled
until
we
saw
she
was
ill
and
her
mother
gave
me
one
look
and
bundled
her
right
out
to
the
carriage
and
off
to
a
better
place
and
we
got
a
doctor
and
a
nurse
but
all
that
night
she
was
in
danger
of
her
life
i
went
in
to
her
room
that
evening
to
put
things
in
order
and
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
like
a
dead
thing
white
sick
and
with
her
eyes
never
moving
off
her
face
i
could
hear
her
murmuring
the
whole
story
the
shame
and
the
bitter
cruelty
of
it
crying
sometimes
and
her
mother
crying
too
mama
she
said
the
innocence
of
her
did
the
doctor
tell
you
that
there
might
have
been
a
baby
i
did
know
it
myself
until
a
few
weeks
ago
and
that
why
they
so
frightened
about
me
now
but
she
said
beginning
to
cry
again
should
have
hated
it
i
always
hated
it
and
i
rather
have
it
all
over
i
do
want
to
have
to
face
anything
more
well
it
looked
then
as
if
she
could
possibly
live
through
the
night
and
all
her
mother
could
think
of
was
to
comfort
her
she
told
her
that
they
would
go
away
and
forget
it
all
and
miss
annie
clung
to
her
through
the
whole
terrible
thing
we
none
of
us
got
any
sleep
that
night
and
i
think
it
was
at
about
three
the
next
morning
that
i
crept
to
the
door
and
the
doctor
doctor
leslie
an
old
english
doctor
who
was
very
kind
came
to
the
door
and
gave
me
the
poor
little
pitiful
baby
in
a
blanket
i
almost
screamed
when
i
took
it
for
the
poor
little
soul
was
alive
working
her
little
mouth
i
took
her
to
my
room
and
indeed
i
baptized
her
myself
i
named
her
mary
for
my
mother
and
leslie
for
the
doctor
but
i
never
thought
she
need
a
name
then
she
was
under
four
pounds
and
with
a
little
claw
like
a
monkey
paw
and
so
thin
we
did
dare
dress
her
we
thought
she
was
three
months
too
soon
then
and
i
just
sat
watching
her
waiting
for
her
to
die
and
thinking
of
my
own
miss
annie
was
given
up
the
next
day
she
gone
into
a
brain
fever
but
my
poor
little
soul
was
wailing
a
good
healthy
wail
i
remember
i
cried
bitterly
when
the
doctor
told
me
not
to
hope
for
her
but
she
lived
and
on
the
fourth
day
melrose
sent
us
away
and
we
went
and
stayed
in
the
country
for
two
months
after
that
then
i
had
a
letter
from
the
riviera
the
first
that
come
miss
annie
was
getting
well
her
hair
was
coming
out
curly
and
she
hardly
remembered
anything
about
what
had
happened
at
all
she
was
nineteen
then
poor
child
she
had
cried
once
her
mother
wrote
and
had
said
she
thanked
god
the
baby
had
died
and
that
was
all
she
ever
said
of
it
i
brought
the
baby
home
and
for
nearly
three
years
she
lived
with
my
own
and
of
course
melrose
paid
me
for
it
and
then
one
day
louison
courtot
came
to
see
me
i
known
her
of
course
theodore
wife
that
had
been
miss
annie
maid
she
had
a
letter
from
melrose
and
she
took
leslie
away
and
gave
her
to
her
grandmother
just
according
to
plan
well
i
did
like
it
though
it
gave
the
child
her
rights
but
it
did
seem
honest
i
had
no
call
to
interfere
and
a
few
months
later
melrose
gave
me
the
double
house
in
brooklyn
that
well
remember
norma
and
your
own
father
made
out
the
deed
of
gift
chris
and
then
perhaps
a
year
later
louison
came
to
call
on
me
again
and
with
her
was
a
little
girl
four
years
old
and
i
looked
at
her
and
looked
at
louison
and
i
said
god
that
a
melrose
she
said
yes
it
was
theodore
child
norma
chris
said
norma
and
i
remember
her
as
if
it
was
yesterday
with
a
blue
velvet
coat
on
her
and
a
white
collar
and
the
way
she
dragged
off
her
little
mittens
to
go
over
and
play
with
rose
and
wolf
and
the
little
coaxing
air
she
had
so
then
louison
told
me
the
story
how
she
had
never
told
melrose
that
theodore
really
had
a
daughter
because
she
hated
her
so
but
she
was
going
to
be
married
again
and
go
to
canada
and
she
wanted
me
to
keep
the
baby
until
she
could
send
for
her
i
said
i
would
see
how
it
went
but
i
could
see
then
that
there
never
was
in
the
world
sheridan
interrupted
herself
coughed
and
glanced
at
the
girl
well
we
liked
norma
right
then
and
there
she
finished
a
little
tamely
oh
aunt
kate
norma
said
smiling
through
tears
her
hand
tight
upon
the
older
woman
you
never
will
praise
me
so
norma
the
story
went
on
had
her
supper
that
night
between
my
two
children
and
for
fourteen
years
she
never
knew
that
she
was
our
own
and
perhaps
she
never
would
have
known
if
louison
had
written
me
that
she
was
in
a
hospital
she
was
to
have
an
operation
and
she
was
willing
at
last
to
make
peace
with
her
husband
family
in
the
same
letter
was
her
husband
note
that
she
was
gone
so
i
had
to
use
my
own
judgment
then
and
when
i
heard
norma
talk
of
the
rich
girls
she
saw
in
the
bookstore
chris
and
knew
how
she
loved
what
money
could
do
for
her
it
seemed
to
me
that
at
least
i
must
tell
her
grandmother
the
truth
so
we
came
here
three
years
ago
and
if
it
was
for
miss
alice
mistake
about
her
perhaps
the
story
would
have
come
out
then
but
that
all
the
truth
chris
nodded
his
arms
folded
on
his
chest
his
tired
face
very
thoughtful
it
makes
her
a
rich
woman
sheridan
he
said
i
suppose
so
sir
i
understand
melrose
the
old
gentleman
left
everything
to
his
son
theodore
but
not
only
that
chris
said
she
can
claim
every
penny
that
has
ever
been
paid
over
to
leslie
all
through
her
minority
and
since
she
came
of
age
and
she
also
inherits
the
larger
part
of
her
estate
under
the
will
probably
melrose
would
have
changed
that
if
she
had
lived
when
all
this
came
to
light
and
given
that
same
legacy
to
leslie
but
we
ca
act
on
that
supposition
the
court
will
probably
feel
that
a
very
grave
injustice
has
been
done
norma
and
exact
the
full
arrears
but
chris
norma
said
quickly
surely
some
way
can
be
found
to
leslie
all
that
would
have
come
to
me
well
that
of
course
would
be
pure
generosity
on
your
part
he
said
quietly
however
it
would
seem
to
me
desirable
all
round
he
added
to
keep
this
in
the
family
oh
i
think
so
norma
agreed
eagerly
annie
and
hendrick
must
be
informed
and
as
leslie
mother
annie
will
provide
for
her
some
day
of
course
we
discuss
all
that
later
but
i
only
wanted
to
clear
up
a
few
points
before
i
see
judge
lee
he
has
the
will
i
believe
he
will
be
here
morning
in
the
meanwhile
i
think
i
would
say
nothing
norma
just
because
annie
is
so
upset
and
if
leslie
heard
any
garbled
story
before
she
got
here
oh
i
agree
with
you
entirely
chris
anything
that
makes
it
easier
all
round
norma
could
afford
to
be
magnanimous
and
agreeable
she
would
not
have
been
human
not
to
feel
herself
the
most
interesting
figure
in
all
this
dramatic
situation
not
to
know
that
thoughtfulness
and
generosity
were
the
most
charming
parts
of
her
new
rôle
quietly
affectionately
she
went
to
the
door
with
aunt
kate
i
wish
i
could
go
home
with
you
she
said
but
i
think
they
need
me
here
and
if
wolf
should
come
up
saturday
aunt
kate
you
tell
him
about
the
funeral
rose
said
he
was
coming
up
on
saturday
his
mother
said
but
if
he
does
of
course
he
understand
remember
norma
she
added
drawing
the
girl
aside
a
moment
in
the
lower
hall
remember
that
they
all
been
very
kind
to
you
dear
it
going
to
be
hard
for
them
all
yes
i
know
norma
said
hastily
the
admonition
not
to
her
taste
and
what
you
and
wolf
will
do
with
all
that
money
her
aunt
mused
shaking
her
head
well
one
thing
at
a
time
but
i
know
she
finished
fondly
my
girl
will
show
them
all
what
a
generous
and
a
lovely
nature
she
has
in
all
the
changes
and
shifts
clever
aunt
kate
norma
smiled
to
herself
as
she
went
upstairs
she
had
hundreds
of
times
before
this
guided
the
girl
by
premature
confidence
and
praise
she
knew
how
norma
loved
the
approbation
of
those
about
her
not
but
what
norma
meant
to
be
everything
that
was
broad
and
considerate
now
she
had
assumed
that
position
from
the
beginning
leslie
chagrin
aunt
annie
consternation
should
be
respected
and
humoured
they
had
sometimes
shown
her
the
arrogant
the
supercilious
side
of
the
melrose
nature
in
the
years
gone
by
now
she
the
truest
melrose
of
them
all
would
show
them
real
greatness
of
soul
she
would
talk
it
all
over
with
wolf
of
course
she
missed
wolf
it
was
as
always
a
curiously
unsatisfying
atmosphere
this
of
the
old
melrose
house
the
whispers
the
hushed
footsteps
the
lowered
voices
aunt
annie
plaintive
heroism
in
her
superb
crapes
the
almost
belligerent
loyalty
of
the
intimate
friends
who
praised
and
marvelled
at
her
the
costly
flowers
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
them
the
extra
men
helping
joseph
to
keep
everything
decorous
and
beautiful
somehow
it
all
sickened
norma
and
she
wished
that
wolf
could
come
and
take
her
for
a
walk
and
talk
to
her
about
it
he
would
be
interested
in
it
all
and
he
would
laugh
at
her
account
of
the
undertakers
and
he
would
break
into
elementary
socialism
when
the
cost
of
the
whole
pompous
pageant
was
estimated
and
what
would
he
think
of
her
wealth
norma
tried
to
imagine
it
but
somehow
she
could
not
think
of
wolf
as
very
much
affected
he
hated
society
primarily
and
he
would
never
be
idle
not
for
the
treasures
of
india
he
would
let
her
spend
it
as
she
pleased
and
go
on
working
rapturously
at
his
valves
and
meters
and
gauges
perhaps
delighted
if
she
bought
him
the
costliest
made
or
the
finest
of
mechanical
but
quite
as
willing
that
the
pearls
about
his
wife
throat
should
cost
fifty
dollars
as
fifty
thousand
and
quite
as
anxious
that
the
heiress
of
the
melroses
should
make
good
with
his
associate
workers
as
if
she
had
been
still
a
little
clerk
from
bookshop
but
cheerfully
indifferent
as
he
was
to
everything
that
made
life
worth
living
to
such
a
man
as
christopher
liggett
she
knew
that
he
would
not
go
to
california
without
her
unless
there
was
a
definite
break
between
them
she
knew
she
could
not
persuade
him
to
leave
her
here
as
a
normal
and
pleasant
solution
just
until
everything
was
settled
and
until
they
could
see
a
little
further
ahead
no
wolf
was
annoyingly
conventional
where
his
wife
was
concerned
her
place
was
with
him
unless
for
some
secondary
reason
they
had
decided
to
part
and
she
knew
that
if
he
let
her
go
it
would
be
because
he
felt
that
he
never
should
have
claimed
her
that
in
the
highest
sense
he
never
had
had
her
at
all
chapter
xxxii
moving
automatically
through
the
solemn
scenes
of
the
next
two
days
that
mused
norma
must
be
the
solution
wolf
must
go
alone
to
california
not
because
she
did
not
love
him
who
could
help
loving
him
indeed
but
because
she
loved
chris
more
or
differently
at
least
and
she
belonged
to
chris
world
now
by
every
right
of
birth
wealth
and
position
of
course
you
must
stay
here
chris
said
positively
on
the
one
occasion
when
they
spoke
of
her
plans
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
estate
to
settle
we
shall
need
you
then
there
are
books
pictures
all
that
sort
of
thing
to
manage
the
old
servants
to
dispose
of
and
probably
this
house
to
sell
but
we
can
discuss
that
judge
lee
has
felt
for
a
long
time
that
this
is
the
right
site
for
a
big
apartment
house
especially
if
we
can
get
hold
of
boyer
plot
you
had
better
take
a
suite
at
one
of
the
hotels
and
later
we
can
look
up
the
right
sort
of
an
apartment
for
you
not
a
word
of
his
personal
hopes
missing
them
she
felt
oddly
cheated
wolf
goes
to
california
next
month
she
said
christopher
gave
her
a
sharp
quizzing
look
but
i
think
you
had
decided
weeks
ago
that
you
were
not
going
yes
i
told
him
so
she
faltered
she
felt
strangely
lost
and
forlorn
releasing
her
hold
on
wolf
and
yet
not
able
to
claim
christopher
support
it
was
contemptible
it
was
weak
in
her
she
felt
but
she
could
not
quite
choke
down
her
hunger
for
one
reassuring
word
from
chris
i
feel
so
lonely
chris
she
said
he
gave
a
quick
uneasy
glance
about
the
where
they
were
having
a
hasty
luncheon
no
one
was
within
hearing
you
understand
my
position
now
he
said
oh
of
course
but
she
felt
oddly
chilled
chris
as
the
bereaved
husband
and
was
perfect
of
course
almost
too
perfect
if
wolf
loved
a
woman
but
then
the
fancy
of
wolf
married
and
confessedly
loving
a
woman
who
was
another
man
wife
was
absurd
anyway
wolf
did
not
belong
to
the
world
where
such
things
were
common
it
was
utterly
foreign
to
his
nature
with
all
the
rest
wolf
did
not
go
to
operas
and
picture
galleries
and
polo
matches
he
did
not
know
how
to
comport
himself
at
afternoon
teas
or
summer
lunches
at
the
country
club
and
norma
life
would
be
spent
in
this
atmosphere
now
she
would
get
her
frocks
from
madame
modiste
and
her
hats
from
the
avenue
specialists
she
would
be
a
smart
and
a
conspicuous
little
figure
at
lenox
and
bar
harbour
and
newport
she
would
spend
her
days
with
masseuses
and
dressmakers
and
with
french
and
italian
teachers
she
could
travel
some
day
but
here
the
thought
of
chris
crept
in
and
she
was
a
little
hurt
at
chris
his
exquisite
poise
his
sureness
of
being
absolutely
correct
was
one
of
his
charms
but
it
was
a
little
hard
not
to
have
the
depth
of
his
present
feeling
for
her
sweep
him
off
his
feet
just
occasionally
he
had
indeed
shown
her
far
more
daring
favour
when
alice
was
alive
meeting
norma
down
town
driving
her
about
walking
with
her
where
they
might
reasonably
fear
to
be
seen
now
and
then
it
came
to
her
painfully
that
even
there
chris
respect
for
the
conventions
of
his
world
was
not
at
fault
flirtations
crushes
cases
and
suitors
were
entirely
acceptable
in
the
circle
that
chris
so
conspicuously
ornamented
to
pay
desperate
attentions
to
a
pretty
young
married
woman
was
quite
excusable
it
would
have
been
universally
understood
but
to
show
the
faintest
trace
of
interest
in
her
while
his
wife
lay
dead
and
while
his
house
was
plunged
into
mourning
no
chris
would
not
do
that
that
would
not
be
good
form
it
would
be
censured
as
not
being
compatible
with
the
standard
of
a
gentleman
his
conduct
now
must
be
beyond
criticism
he
was
the
domestic
dictator
in
this
as
in
every
emergency
norma
listened
while
he
and
hendrick
and
annie
discussed
the
funeral
they
were
in
the
big
upstairs
bedroom
that
annie
had
appropriated
to
herself
during
these
days
annie
was
resting
on
a
couch
in
a
nest
of
little
pillows
her
long
bare
hands
very
white
against
the
blackness
of
her
gown
hendrick
did
most
of
the
talking
chris
listening
thoughtfully
accepting
rejecting
norma
a
mere
spectator
she
decided
that
annie
was
playing
her
part
with
a
stimulating
consciousness
of
its
dignity
and
that
chris
was
not
much
better
honest
hendrick
was
only
genuinely
anxious
to
arrange
these
details
without
a
scene
i
take
annie
up
the
aisle
chris
said
you
be
a
hendrick
lee
says
that
the
judge
feels
he
is
too
old
to
serve
so
he
will
follow
me
with
leslie
she
gets
here
this
afternoon
then
acton
brings
norma
and
that
fills
the
family
pew
now
in
the
next
pew
it
reminded
norma
of
something
she
could
not
for
a
moment
remember
what
then
it
came
to
her
of
course
leslie
wedding
they
had
discussed
precedence
and
pews
just
that
way
music
too
hendrick
was
making
a
note
of
music
alice
favourite
dirge
was
to
be
played
and
come
ye
disconsolate
which
had
been
sung
at
theodore
funeral
thirteen
years
ago
and
at
his
father
seven
years
before
that
was
to
be
sung
by
the
famous
church
choir
the
church
was
unfortunately
small
so
cards
were
to
be
given
to
the
few
hundreds
that
it
would
accommodate
hendrick
suggested
a
larger
church
but
annie
shut
her
eyes
leaning
back
and
faintly
shaking
her
head
please
hendrick
she
articulated
wearily
mama
loved
that
church
and
there
so
little
that
we
can
do
now
so
little
that
she
ever
wanted
dear
old
saint
it
was
not
hypocrisy
norma
thought
annie
had
been
a
good
daughter
indeed
she
had
been
unusually
loyal
as
the
daughters
of
annie
set
saw
their
filial
duties
but
something
in
this
overwhelming
becoming
grief
combined
with
so
lively
a
sense
of
what
was
socially
correct
jarred
unpleasantly
on
the
younger
woman
of
course
funerals
had
to
have
management
like
everything
else
and
it
was
only
part
of
annie
code
to
believe
that
an
awkwardness
now
a
social
error
ever
so
faint
an
opportunity
given
the
world
for
amusement
or
criticism
would
reflect
upon
the
family
and
upon
the
dead
norma
carried
on
long
mental
conversations
with
wolf
criticizing
or
defending
the
melroses
she
imagined
herself
telling
him
of
the
shock
it
had
given
her
to
realize
that
her
grandmother
body
was
barely
cold
before
an
autocratic
and
noisy
french
hairdresser
had
arrived
demanding
electric
heat
and
as
casually
as
if
his
customer
had
been
the
bustling
vain
old
lady
of
a
week
ago
she
laughed
secretly
whenever
she
recalled
the
solemn
undertaker
who
had
solicited
her
own
aid
in
filling
out
a
blank
his
first
melancholy
question
and
thud
dame
of
the
father
norma
had
momentarily
supposed
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
prayer
and
it
had
been
with
an
almost
hysterical
revulsion
of
feeling
that
she
had
said
oh
her
father
name
oh
francis
dabney
murison
wolf
who
would
not
laugh
at
one
tenth
of
the
things
that
amused
chris
or
that
annie
found
richly
funny
would
laugh
at
these
little
glimpses
of
a
formal
funeral
norma
knew
and
he
would
remember
other
odd
bits
of
reading
that
were
in
the
same
key
from
macaulay
or
henry
george
or
a
scrap
of
newspaper
that
had
chanced
to
be
pasted
upon
an
wall
leslie
came
into
the
house
late
on
the
afternoon
of
friday
and
there
was
much
fresh
crying
between
her
and
annie
leslie
had
on
new
black
too
just
what
i
could
grab
down
there
she
explained
and
was
pettish
and
weary
with
fatigue
and
the
nervous
shock
she
gave
only
the
side
of
her
cheek
to
acton
dutiful
kiss
and
answered
his
question
about
the
baby
with
an
impatient
oh
heavens
she
all
what
could
be
the
matter
with
her
she
did
have
a
cold
but
now
she
all
right
and
when
i
about
grandma
and
poor
aunt
alice
i
do
you
would
take
me
up
so
quickly
i
been
travelling
all
night
and
my
head
is
splitting
if
it
was
that
had
the
cold
i
do
believe
you
be
so
fussy
poor
little
girl
it
hard
for
you
not
to
have
seen
them
once
more
christopher
said
tenderly
failing
to
meet
the
and
glance
that
norma
sent
him
leslie
burst
into
tears
and
held
tight
to
his
hand
as
they
all
sat
down
in
annie
room
i
believe
i
feel
it
most
for
you
uncle
chris
she
sobbed
it
changes
my
life
ends
it
as
surely
as
it
did
hers
chris
said
quietly
just
now
well
i
do
see
ahead
just
now
after
awhile
i
believe
she
come
back
to
me
her
sweetness
and
goodness
and
bigness
for
alice
was
the
biggest
woman
and
the
finest
that
i
ever
knew
and
then
i
try
to
live
again
just
as
she
would
have
had
me
and
meanwhile
i
try
to
comfort
myself
that
i
tried
to
show
her
in
whatever
clumsy
way
i
could
that
i
appreciated
her
you
not
only
showed
her
you
showed
all
the
world
chris
annie
said
stretching
a
hand
toward
him
norma
felt
a
sudden
uprising
of
some
emotion
singularly
akin
to
contempt
a
maid
signalled
her
and
she
stepped
to
the
door
a
special
delivery
letter
had
come
from
wolf
the
maid
went
away
again
but
norma
stood
where
she
was
reading
it
wolf
had
written
dear
norma
mother
wrote
me
of
all
that
you
have
been
going
through
and
i
am
as
sorry
as
i
can
be
for
all
their
trouble
and
glad
that
they
have
you
to
help
them
through
mother
also
told
me
of
the
change
in
your
position
there
i
had
always
known
vaguely
that
we
did
understand
it
all
i
remember
now
your
coming
to
us
in
brooklyn
and
your
mother
crying
when
she
went
away
i
know
this
will
make
a
difference
to
you
and
be
one
more
reason
for
your
not
coming
west
with
me
you
must
use
your
own
judgment
but
the
longer
i
think
of
it
the
meaner
it
seems
to
me
for
me
to
take
advantage
of
your
coming
to
me
last
spring
and
our
getting
married
i
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
nothing
will
ever
make
me
like
or
respect
the
man
you
say
you
care
for
i
do
believe
you
do
care
for
him
and
i
would
rather
see
you
dead
than
married
to
him
but
it
is
for
me
to
say
of
course
if
you
like
him
that
enough
if
you
ever
stop
liking
him
and
will
come
back
to
me
i
meet
you
anywhere
or
take
you
anywhere
it
wo
make
any
difference
what
mother
thinks
or
rose
thinks
or
any
one
else
i
written
and
destroyed
this
letter
about
six
times
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
if
you
think
i
am
standing
in
the
way
of
your
happiness
i
wo
stand
there
even
though
i
believe
you
are
making
an
awful
mistake
about
that
particular
man
and
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
happiest
eight
months
that
any
man
ever
had
yours
always
wolf
norma
stood
perfectly
still
after
she
read
the
letter
through
with
the
clutch
of
vague
pain
and
shame
at
her
heart
the
stiff
stilted
words
did
not
seem
like
wolf
and
the
definite
hurt
her
why
could
they
be
friends
at
least
granted
that
their
marriage
was
a
mistake
it
had
never
had
anything
but
harmony
in
it
companionship
mutual
respect
and
understanding
and
a
happy
intimacy
as
clean
and
natural
as
the
meeting
of
flowers
she
was
standing
motionless
and
silent
when
leslie
voice
came
clearly
to
her
ears
evidently
acton
annie
and
leslie
were
alone
in
annie
room
out
of
sight
but
not
a
dozen
feet
away
from
where
she
stood
norma
did
not
catch
the
exact
words
but
she
caught
her
name
and
her
heart
stood
still
with
the
instinctive
terror
of
the
trapped
annie
had
not
heard
either
evidently
she
said
what
dear
sympathetically
i
asked
what
norma
doing
here
is
she
overdoing
her
relationship
a
little
leslie
said
languidly
norma
face
burned
she
could
hardly
breathe
as
she
waited
mama
sent
for
her
for
some
reason
annie
answered
with
a
little
drawl
after
all
she
a
sort
of
cousin
is
she
acton
added
oh
do
jump
on
me
for
i
say
acton
leslie
said
angrily
my
chris
says
that
mama
left
her
the
melrose
building
and
i
do
know
what
besides
annie
said
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
i
do
believe
it
what
for
leslie
exclaimed
then
incredulously
and
after
another
silence
she
added
in
a
puzzled
tone
do
understand
it
aunt
annie
evidently
annie
answered
with
a
glance
or
a
shrug
for
there
was
another
pause
before
annie
said
what
i
do
like
about
it
and
what
i
do
wish
mama
had
thought
of
is
the
way
that
people
comment
on
a
thing
like
that
it
not
as
if
norma
needed
it
she
has
a
husband
to
take
care
of
her
now
and
it
makes
us
a
little
ridiculous
one
likes
to
feel
that
at
a
time
like
this
everything
is
to
be
done
decently
at
least
not
enormous
legacies
to
comparative
strangers
i
like
norma
we
all
been
kind
to
her
leslie
contributed
as
annie
voice
died
listlessly
away
i
always
made
allowances
for
her
but
i
confess
that
it
was
rather
a
surprise
to
find
her
here
one
of
the
family
after
all
we
melroses
have
always
rather
prided
ourselves
on
standing
together
have
we
if
she
wants
to
wear
black
for
grandma
why
it
makes
no
difference
to
i
suppose
the
will
could
be
broken
without
any
notoriety
chris
annie
asked
in
an
undertone
norma
heart
turned
sick
she
had
not
supposed
that
chris
was
listening
without
protest
to
this
conversation
no
she
heard
him
say
briefly
and
definitely
that
impossible
it
is
the
money
annie
began
but
leslie
interrupted
with
a
bitter
little
laugh
it
may
not
be
with
you
aunt
annie
but
i
assure
you
i
would
mind
a
few
extra
thousands
she
said
i
think
you
get
the
newport
house
leslie
chris
said
in
a
tone
whose
dubiety
only
norma
could
understand
the
newport
house
leslie
exclaimed
why
but
do
i
own
now
i
thought
i
do
really
know
chris
answered
we
open
the
will
next
week
and
then
we
straighten
everything
out
in
the
meanwhile
annie
said
lazily
if
she
suggests
going
back
to
her
own
family
for
heaven
sake
do
stop
her
i
like
norma
always
have
but
after
all
there
are
times
when
outsider
no
matter
how
agreeable
she
is
i
think
she
go
immediately
after
the
funeral
chris
said
constrainedly
and
uncertainly
norma
suddenly
roused
both
to
a
realization
of
the
utter
impropriety
of
her
overhearing
all
this
and
the
danger
of
detection
slipped
from
the
by
the
hall
door
and
so
escaped
to
her
own
room
she
shut
the
door
behind
her
walked
irresolutely
to
the
bed
stood
there
for
a
moment
with
her
hands
pressed
to
her
cheeks
walked
blindly
to
the
window
only
to
pause
again
paced
the
room
mechanically
for
a
few
minutes
and
finally
found
herself
seated
on
the
broad
sill
of
the
window
staring
down
unseeing
at
the
afternoon
traffic
in
madison
avenue
oh
how
she
hated
them
cruel
selfish
snobs
snobs
snobs
that
they
were
leslie
leslie
making
allowances
for
her
leslie
making
allowances
for
and
annie
hoping
that
for
heaven
sake
nobody
would
prevent
her
from
going
home
after
the
funeral
the
remembered
phrases
burned
and
stung
like
acid
upon
her
soul
she
wanted
to
hurt
annie
and
leslie
as
they
had
hurt
her
she
wanted
to
shame
them
and
anger
them
yes
and
she
could
do
it
too
she
could
do
it
they
little
knew
that
within
a
few
days
time
utter
consternation
and
upheaval
notoriety
and
shame
and
the
pity
of
their
intimates
would
disrupt
the
surface
of
their
lives
that
surface
that
they
felt
it
so
important
to
keep
smooth
people
will
comment
norma
quoted
to
herself
with
a
bitter
smile
indeed
people
would
comment
as
they
had
never
commented
even
upon
the
melroses
before
leslie
would
be
robbed
not
only
of
her
inheritance
but
of
her
name
and
of
her
position
and
annie
even
magnificent
aunt
annie
must
accept
with
what
surface
veneer
of
cordiality
she
might
affect
the
only
child
of
her
only
brother
the
heir
to
the
family
estate
i
believe
i
horribly
tired
norma
said
to
herself
looking
out
into
the
dimming
winter
day
or
else
i
nervous
or
something
i
wish
i
could
go
over
to
rose
and
help
her
put
the
children
to
bed
or
i
wish
aunt
kate
would
telephone
for
me
i
sick
of
this
place
or
i
wish
wolf
would
come
walking
around
that
corner
oh
if
he
would
if
he
would
norma
said
staring
out
with
an
intensity
so
great
that
it
seemed
to
her
for
the
moment
that
wolf
indeed
might
come
if
only
come
to
take
me
to
dinner
at
some
little
italian
place
with
a
backyard
and
skyscrapers
all
about
so
that
we
could
talk
regina
coming
in
a
little
later
saw
that
sheridan
had
been
crying
and
reproached
her
with
the
affectionate
familiarity
of
an
old
servitor
you
that
were
always
so
miss
it
do
seem
right
for
you
to
grieve
so
said
regina
a
little
tearful
herself
norma
smiled
and
wiped
her
eyes
this
is
a
nice
beginning
the
girl
told
herself
as
she
bathed
and
dressed
for
the
evening
ordeal
of
calls
and
messages
and
solemn
visits
to
the
chamber
of
death
this
is
a
nice
beginning
for
a
woman
who
knows
that
the
man
she
loves
is
free
to
marry
her
and
who
has
just
fallen
heir
to
a
great
fortune
chapter
xxxiii
the
evening
moved
through
its
dark
and
sombre
hours
unchanged
assistants
opened
and
opened
and
opened
the
door
more
flowers
more
flowers
and
more
notes
telephone
messages
callers
murmuring
in
the
dimness
of
the
lower
hall
maids
coming
noiselessly
and
deferentially
the
clergyman
the
doctor
the
old
judge
lee
tremulous
and
tedious
all
her
world
circled
about
the
lifeless
form
of
the
old
mistress
of
the
house
certain
persons
went
quietly
upstairs
women
in
rich
furs
and
men
entered
the
front
room
and
passed
through
with
serious
faces
and
slowly
shaking
heads
chris
spoke
to
norma
in
the
hall
just
after
she
had
said
to
some
rather
important
callers
assuring
them
that
annie
and
leslie
were
well
and
had
been
kissed
herself
as
their
representative
he
extended
her
a
crushed
document
in
which
she
was
alarmed
to
recognize
letter
oh
i
think
i
dropped
that
in
aunt
annie
norma
said
turning
scarlet
and
wondering
what
eyes
had
seen
it
there
was
no
envelope
a
maid
brought
it
to
her
and
annie
read
it
chris
said
norma
eyes
were
racing
through
it
there
are
no
names
she
said
thankfully
it
would
have
been
a
most
unfortunate
a
a
horrible
thing
if
there
had
been
chris
commented
something
in
his
manner
said
as
plainly
as
words
that
dropping
the
letter
had
been
a
breach
of
good
manners
had
been
extremely
careless
almost
reprehensible
norma
felt
herself
unreasonably
antagonized
oh
i
do
know
it
true
she
said
recklessly
annie
is
a
very
important
person
in
your
plans
norma
chris
reminded
her
it
would
be
most
regrettable
for
you
to
lose
your
head
now
to
give
everyone
an
opportunity
of
criticizing
you
i
should
advise
you
to
enlist
your
aunt
annie
sympathies
just
as
soon
as
you
can
she
is
of
all
the
world
the
one
woman
who
can
direct
you
help
you
equip
yourself
tell
you
what
to
get
and
how
to
establish
yourself
if
annie
chose
to
be
unfriendly
to
ignore
you
i
do
see
annie
von
behrens
ignoring
me
now
norma
said
with
anger
and
throwing
her
head
back
proudly
they
were
in
a
curtained
alcove
on
the
landing
of
the
angled
stairway
completely
hidden
by
the
great
curtain
and
by
potted
palms
when
my
revered
aunt
realizes
your
money
will
have
absolutely
no
effect
on
annie
chris
said
quickly
no
but
what
i
will
norma
answered
breathing
hard
not
while
we
keep
it
to
ourselves
as
of
course
we
must
chris
answered
in
displeasure
no
one
but
ourselves
will
ever
know
the
whole
world
will
know
norma
said
in
sudden
impatience
with
smoothing
and
hiding
and
pretending
chris
straightened
his
eyeglasses
on
their
ribbon
and
gave
her
his
scrutinizing
unruffled
glance
that
would
be
foolish
i
think
norma
he
told
her
calmly
it
would
be
a
most
unnecessary
piece
of
vulgarity
old
families
are
constantly
hushing
up
unfortunate
chapters
in
their
history
there
is
no
reason
why
the
whole
thing
should
not
be
kept
an
absolute
secret
my
dear
girl
you
have
just
had
a
most
extraordinary
piece
of
good
fortune
but
you
must
be
very
careful
how
you
take
it
you
will
be
you
are
a
tremendously
wealthy
woman
and
you
will
be
in
the
public
eye
upon
how
you
conduct
yourself
now
your
future
position
largely
depends
annie
can
and
i
believe
will
gladly
assist
you
acton
and
leslie
will
go
abroad
i
suppose
they
ca
live
here
but
a
breath
of
scandal
or
an
slip
on
your
part
would
make
us
all
ridiculous
you
must
play
your
cards
carefully
if
you
could
stay
with
annie
now
i
aunt
annie
norma
interrupted
childishly
my
dear
girl
you
you
do
mean
what
you
say
chris
said
putting
his
hand
on
her
arm
under
the
light
touch
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
stood
still
norma
do
be
advised
by
me
in
this
he
urged
her
earnestly
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
crises
in
your
life
annie
can
put
you
exactly
where
you
want
to
be
introduced
and
accepted
everywhere
a
constant
guest
in
her
house
in
her
opera
box
or
annie
can
drop
you
i
seen
her
do
it
and
it
would
take
you
ten
years
to
make
up
the
lost
ground
it
did
take
annie
ten
years
to
be
a
a
social
leader
norma
argued
resentfully
annie
ah
my
dear
a
woman
like
annie
is
born
twice
in
a
hundred
years
she
has
but
you
know
what
she
has
norma
languages
experiences
friends
most
of
all
she
has
the
grand
manner
the
norma
was
fighting
to
regain
her
composure
over
almost
unbearable
hurt
and
chagrin
but
chris
she
argued
desperately
you
always
said
that
you
had
no
particular
use
for
annie
crowd
that
you
rather
live
in
some
little
italian
place
or
travel
slowly
through
india
i
said
i
would
like
to
do
that
and
so
i
would
he
answered
but
believe
me
norma
your
money
makes
a
very
different
sort
of
thing
possible
now
and
you
would
be
mad
you
would
be
to
throw
it
away
put
yourself
in
annie
hands
he
finished
with
the
first
hint
of
his
old
manner
that
she
had
seen
for
hours
and
have
your
car
your
maids
your
little
establishment
on
the
upper
east
side
and
then
then
and
now
his
arm
was
about
her
and
he
had
tipped
up
her
face
close
to
his
own
and
then
you
and
i
will
break
our
little
surprise
to
them
he
said
kindly
only
be
careful
norma
do
let
them
say
that
you
did
anything
ostentatious
or
conspicuous
she
freed
herself
her
heart
cold
and
desolate
almost
beyond
bearing
and
chris
answered
her
as
if
she
had
spoken
yes
and
i
must
go
too
will
be
a
terrible
day
for
us
all
oh
one
thing
more
norma
annie
asked
me
if
i
had
any
idea
of
who
the
man
was
the
man
wolf
speaks
of
there
in
that
note
and
i
had
to
say
someone
just
to
quiet
her
so
i
said
that
i
thought
it
was
roy
gillespie
you
do
mind
i
knew
he
liked
you
tremendously
and
i
happened
to
think
of
him
is
that
all
right
she
made
no
audible
answer
almost
immediately
leaving
him
and
going
upstairs
there
was
nothing
to
do
in
her
room
and
she
knew
that
she
could
really
be
of
use
downstairs
among
the
intimate
old
friends
who
were
protecting
annie
and
leslie
from
annoyance
but
she
felt
in
no
mood
for
that
she
hated
herself
and
everybody
she
was
with
fatigue
and
despondency
oh
what
was
the
use
of
living
what
was
the
use
of
living
chris
despised
her
that
was
quite
plain
he
had
advised
her
as
he
would
have
advised
an
ignorant
servant
an
inexperienced
commoner
who
might
make
the
family
ridiculous
who
might
lose
her
head
and
descend
to
unnecessary
pieces
of
vulgarity
leslie
had
always
made
allowances
for
norma
annie
considered
her
an
outsider
wolf
was
going
to
california
without
her
and
even
aunt
kate
even
aunt
kate
had
scolded
her
reminded
her
that
the
melroses
had
always
been
kind
to
her
norma
tears
flowed
fast
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
flood
she
sopped
them
away
with
the
handkerchief
and
tried
walking
about
and
drinking
cold
water
but
it
was
of
no
use
her
heart
seemed
broken
there
was
no
avenue
for
her
thoughts
that
did
not
lead
to
loneliness
and
grief
they
had
all
pretended
to
love
her
but
not
one
of
them
did
not
one
of
them
did
she
had
never
had
a
father
and
never
had
a
mother
she
had
never
had
a
fair
chance
money
she
thought
darkly
but
what
was
the
use
of
money
if
everyone
hated
her
if
everyone
thought
she
was
selfish
and
stupid
and
ignorant
and
superfluous
why
find
a
beautiful
apartment
and
buy
beautiful
clothes
if
she
must
flatter
and
cajole
her
way
into
annie
favour
to
enjoy
them
and
bear
chris
superior
disdain
for
her
stumbling
literary
criticisms
and
her
amateurish
italian
and
she
was
furious
at
chris
how
dared
he
how
dared
he
insult
her
by
coupling
her
name
with
that
of
roy
gillespie
to
quiet
annie
and
to
protect
himself
she
was
a
married
woman
she
had
never
given
him
any
reason
to
take
such
liberties
with
her
dignity
roy
gillespie
indeed
annie
was
to
amuse
herself
by
fancying
norma
secretly
enamoured
of
that
big
stupid
simple
gillespie
boy
who
was
years
old
and
hardly
out
of
college
and
it
was
for
him
that
norma
was
presumably
leaving
her
husband
it
was
insufferable
it
was
insufferable
she
would
go
straight
to
annie
but
no
she
could
do
that
she
could
tell
annie
on
the
night
before
annie
sister
was
buried
that
that
same
sister
husband
loved
and
was
beloved
by
another
woman
still
it
true
norma
mused
darkly
only
we
seem
unable
to
speak
the
truth
in
this
house
well
i
stifling
here
she
had
been
leaning
out
of
the
open
window
the
night
was
soft
and
warm
norma
looked
at
her
wrist
watch
it
was
nine
a
sudden
mad
impulse
took
her
she
would
go
over
to
jersey
and
see
rose
it
was
not
so
very
late
the
babies
kept
rose
and
harry
up
until
almost
eleven
she
thirsted
suddenly
for
rose
for
rose
beautiful
pure
little
face
her
puzzled
earnest
blue
eyes
under
black
eyebrows
her
pleasant
unready
words
that
were
always
so
true
and
so
kind
rapidly
norma
buttoned
the
new
black
coat
dropped
the
filmy
veil
fled
down
the
back
stairway
and
through
a
bright
hot
pantry
where
maids
were
laughing
and
eating
gaily
she
explained
to
their
horrified
silence
that
she
was
slipping
out
for
a
breath
of
air
went
through
doorways
and
gratings
and
found
herself
in
the
blessed
coolness
and
darkness
of
the
side
street
ah
this
was
delicious
she
belonged
here
flying
along
inconspicuous
and
unmolested
in
light
and
darkness
just
one
of
the
hurrying
and
indifferent
millions
the
shop
windows
the
subways
the
very
and
the
chestnut
ovens
with
their
blowing
lamps
looked
friendly
to
norma
she
loved
every
detail
of
blowing
newspapers
and
yawning
in
the
hot
bright
tube
on
the
other
side
she
was
hurrying
off
the
train
with
the
plunging
crowd
when
her
heart
jumped
wildly
at
the
sight
of
a
familiar
shabby
overcoat
some
fifty
feet
ahead
of
her
topped
by
the
slightly
tipped
slouch
hat
that
wolf
always
wore
friday
night
her
thoughts
flashed
joyously
and
he
was
coming
to
new
jersey
to
see
his
mother
and
rose
of
all
fortunate
accidents
the
one
person
in
the
world
she
wanted
to
see
and
must
see
now
norma
fled
after
the
coat
dodging
and
slipping
through
every
opening
and
keeping
the
rapidly
moving
slouch
hat
before
her
she
was
quite
out
of
breath
when
she
came
abreast
of
the
man
and
saw
with
a
sickening
revulsion
that
it
was
not
wolf
what
the
man
thought
norma
never
knew
or
cared
the
surprising
blankness
of
the
disappointment
made
her
almost
dizzy
she
turned
aside
blindly
and
stumbled
into
the
quiet
backwater
behind
a
stairway
where
she
could
recover
her
and
endure
unobserved
the
first
pangs
of
bitterness
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
would
die
if
she
could
not
see
wolf
if
she
had
to
endure
another
minute
of
loneliness
and
darkness
and
aimless
wandering
through
the
night
rose
house
was
only
three
blocks
from
the
station
norma
almost
ran
them
other
houses
she
noted
were
still
brightly
lighted
at
quarter
to
eleven
and
rose
might
be
aunt
kate
was
there
and
she
and
rose
might
well
be
sitting
up
with
the
restless
smaller
baby
or
to
finish
some
bit
of
sewing
it
was
a
double
house
and
the
windows
that
matched
rose
bedroom
and
were
lighted
in
the
wrong
half
but
all
rose
side
was
black
and
dark
and
silent
norma
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
needed
courage
for
the
knocking
and
ringing
and
explaining
if
they
would
surely
be
kind
to
her
she
might
chance
it
she
thought
but
if
aunt
kate
was
angry
with
her
vacillations
in
regard
to
wolf
and
if
rose
had
also
taken
wolf
side
then
she
knew
that
she
norma
would
begin
to
cry
and
disgrace
herself
and
have
simple
old
harry
poking
about
and
wondering
what
was
the
matter
no
she
did
dare
risk
it
so
she
waited
in
the
little
garden
looking
up
at
the
windows
praying
that
little
harry
would
wake
up
or
that
the
baby
little
acid
wail
would
drift
through
the
open
window
and
then
the
dim
light
bloom
suddenly
and
show
a
silhouette
of
rose
tall
and
sweet
in
her
wrapper
with
a
great
rope
of
braid
falling
over
one
shoulder
but
moments
went
by
and
there
was
no
sound
norma
went
to
the
street
lamp
a
hundred
feet
away
and
looked
at
her
wrist
watch
quarter
past
eleven
it
was
useless
to
wait
any
longer
it
had
been
a
senseless
quest
from
the
beginning
she
went
back
to
the
city
by
train
and
boat
crying
desolately
in
the
darkness
above
the
ploughing
of
the
invisible
waters
she
cried
with
pity
for
herself
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
life
was
very
unfair
to
her
is
it
fault
that
i
inherit
all
that
money
she
asked
the
dark
night
angrily
is
it
my
fault
that
i
love
chris
liggett
is
it
better
to
be
honest
about
it
than
live
with
a
man
i
do
love
that
the
worst
thing
that
woman
can
endure
a
loveless
marriage
but
that
just
the
high
school
debating
society
she
interrupted
herself
suddenly
using
a
phrase
that
she
and
wolf
had
coined
long
ago
for
glib
argument
that
is
untouched
by
actual
knowledge
of
life
loveless
marriage
and
wife
in
name
only
i
wonder
if
i
am
getting
to
be
one
of
the
women
who
throw
those
terms
about
as
an
excuse
for
just
sheer
selfishness
and
stupidity
and
her
aunt
phrases
came
back
to
her
making
her
wonder
unhappily
just
where
the
trouble
lay
just
what
sort
of
a
woman
she
was
i
think
you
will
be
whatever
you
want
to
be
norma
sheridan
had
said
you
a
woman
now
you
wolf
wife
but
that
was
just
what
she
did
not
feel
herself
a
woman
and
wife
she
was
a
girl
interested
in
shaggy
sport
coats
and
lace
stockings
she
did
not
want
to
be
any
one
wife
she
wanted
to
punish
leslie
and
aunt
annie
and
to
have
plenty
of
money
and
to
have
a
wonderful
little
apartment
on
the
east
side
of
the
park
and
delicious
clothes
she
wanted
to
become
a
figure
in
new
york
society
at
palm
beach
and
the
summer
resorts
and
at
the
opera
and
the
big
of
the
hotels
and
i
could
do
it
too
norma
thought
walking
through
the
cool
dark
night
restlessly
in
two
years
in
three
or
four
anyway
i
would
be
where
aunt
annie
is
or
at
least
i
would
if
chris
and
i
were
married
he
could
do
anything
i
suppose
she
added
with
youthful
recklessness
i
suppose
there
are
lots
of
old
fogies
who
would
never
understand
my
getting
separated
from
wolf
but
it
is
as
if
did
understand
for
i
know
he
does
wolf
has
always
known
that
it
took
just
to
make
me
happy
something
petty
and
contemptible
and
unworthy
in
this
last
argument
smote
her
ears
unpleasantly
and
she
was
conscious
of
flushing
in
the
dark
well
people
have
to
be
happy
do
they
she
reasoned
with
a
rising
inflection
at
the
end
of
the
phrase
that
surprised
and
a
trifle
disquieted
her
do
they
she
asked
herself
thoughtfully
as
she
crept
in
at
the
side
door
of
the
magnificent
cumbersome
old
house
that
was
her
own
now
no
one
but
an
maid
saw
her
as
she
regained
her
room
and
fifteen
minutes
later
she
was
circulating
about
the
dim
and
mournful
upper
floor
again
annie
called
her
into
her
room
you
look
fearfully
tired
norma
do
get
some
sleep
her
aunt
said
with
unusual
kindness
i
going
to
try
to
although
my
head
is
aching
terribly
and
i
know
i
ca
will
be
hard
on
us
all
i
shall
go
home
night
and
i
trying
to
persuade
leslie
to
come
with
me
no
i
sha
i
going
to
stay
here
leslie
said
with
a
sort
of
weary
pettishness
my
house
is
closed
and
poor
chris
is
going
to
begin
closing
aunt
alice
house
and
he
does
want
to
go
to
a
club
much
rather
be
here
would
he
norma
something
in
the
tired
way
that
both
aunt
and
niece
appealed
to
her
touched
norma
and
she
answered
sympathetically
truly
i
think
he
would
aunt
annie
and
if
little
patricia
and
the
nurse
get
here
on
sunday
she
wo
be
lonely
norma
why
do
you
stay
here
too
your
husband
in
philadelphia
leslie
asked
her
do
we
shall
have
so
much
to
do
we
have
seen
the
will
but
i
believe
judge
lee
is
going
to
bring
it
on
wednesday
annie
said
and
chris
said
that
mama
left
you
well
i
do
know
what
i
wish
you
could
arrange
to
stay
the
rest
of
the
week
at
least
i
will
norma
agreed
she
had
been
feeling
neglected
and
lonely
and
this
unexpected
friendliness
was
heartwarming
you
been
a
real
comfort
annie
said
you
such
a
sensible
child
norma
i
hope
one
of
these
days
afterward
and
annie
faintly
indicated
with
her
eyebrows
the
direction
of
the
front
room
from
which
the
funeral
procession
would
start
afterward
that
you
let
us
know
your
husband
better
and
now
it
long
past
midnight
girls
and
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
it
was
mere
casual
civility
on
annie
part
as
accidental
as
had
been
her
casual
unkindness
a
few
hours
before
but
it
lifted
norma
heart
and
she
went
out
into
the
hall
in
a
softer
frame
of
mind
than
she
had
known
for
a
long
time
she
managed
another
word
with
chris
before
going
to
her
room
for
almost
nine
hours
of
reviving
and
restoring
sleep
chris
i
feel
terribly
about
breaking
this
news
to
aunt
annie
and
leslie
while
they
feel
so
badly
about
aunt
alice
and
aunt
marianna
she
said
again
chris
gave
the
hallway
where
she
had
met
him
a
quick
uneasy
scrutiny
before
he
answered
her
well
of
course
but
it
ca
be
helped
but
do
you
think
that
we
could
put
it
off
until
wednesday
chris
when
the
will
is
to
be
read
everyone
will
be
here
then
and
it
would
seem
a
good
time
to
do
it
yes
he
consented
after
a
moment
thought
i
think
that
is
a
good
idea
and
so
they
left
it
chapter
xxxiv
regina
roused
norma
just
in
time
for
the
long
wearisome
ceremonials
of
the
following
day
a
cold
bright
gusty
day
when
the
wet
streets
flashed
back
sombre
reflections
of
the
motor
wheels
and
the
newly
turned
earth
oozed
flashing
drops
of
water
the
cortège
left
the
old
melrose
house
at
ten
minutes
before
ten
and
it
was
four
before
the
tired
headachy
cramped
members
of
the
immediate
family
group
regathered
there
to
discard
the
hats
and
the
odorous
sombre
furs
and
to
talk
quietly
together
as
they
sipped
hot
soup
and
crumbled
rolls
everything
had
been
changed
the
flowers
were
gone
furniture
was
back
in
place
and
the
upper
front
room
had
been
opened
widely
to
the
suddenly
afternoon
there
was
not
a
fallen
violet
petal
to
remind
her
descendants
that
the
old
mistress
of
forty
full
years
was
gone
for
ever
annie
boys
came
to
bring
mother
home
after
so
many
strange
absence
and
norma
liked
the
way
that
annie
smiled
wearily
at
hendrick
and
pressed
her
white
face
hungrily
against
the
boys
blonde
firm
little
faces
leslie
in
an
unwontedly
tender
mood
drew
acton
arm
about
her
as
she
sat
in
a
big
chair
and
told
him
with
watering
eyes
that
she
would
be
glad
to
see
old
on
sunday
norma
sat
alone
the
carved
tudor
oak
rising
high
above
her
little
tired
head
with
its
crushed
soft
hair
and
chris
sat
alone
too
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
and
somehow
in
the
soul
fatigue
that
was
worse
than
any
bodily
fatigue
she
did
not
want
the
distance
between
them
bridged
she
did
not
want
she
shuddered
away
from
the
word
from
chris
again
leslie
who
felt
quite
ill
with
strain
and
sorrow
went
upstairs
to
bed
the
von
behrens
went
away
and
presently
acton
disappeared
to
telephone
old
doctor
murray
that
his
wife
would
like
a
sedative
or
a
heart
stimulant
or
some
other
little
attention
as
a
recognition
of
her
broken
state
then
chris
and
norma
were
alone
and
with
a
quiet
dignity
that
surprised
him
she
beckoned
him
to
the
chair
next
to
her
and
leaning
both
elbows
on
the
cloth
fixed
him
with
her
beautiful
tired
eyes
i
want
to
talk
to
you
chris
and
this
seems
to
be
the
time
she
said
you
be
deep
in
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
for
weeks
now
poor
old
chris
and
i
want
this
said
first
i
been
thinking
very
seriously
all
these
days
they
seem
months
since
aunt
marianna
died
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
well
i
a
fool
she
said
the
last
word
so
unexpectedly
with
such
obvious
surprise
that
chris
tired
colourless
face
broke
into
something
like
a
smile
he
had
seated
himself
next
to
her
and
was
evidently
bending
upon
her
problem
his
most
earnest
attention
some
months
ago
norma
said
in
a
low
voice
i
thought
i
that
i
fell
in
love
the
man
was
rich
and
handsome
and
clever
and
he
knew
more
of
certain
things
in
his
little
finger
than
i
shall
ever
know
in
my
whole
life
not
exactly
more
french
or
more
of
politics
or
more
persons
i
do
mean
quite
that
but
i
mean
a
conglomerate
sort
of
i
expressing
myself
badly
but
you
understand
a
conglomerate
total
of
all
these
things
that
make
him
an
aristocrat
that
what
he
is
an
aristocrat
now
i
not
i
found
that
out
different
nonsense
chris
said
lightly
but
listening
patiently
none
the
less
i
know
norma
resumed
hammering
her
thought
out
slowly
and
frowning
down
at
the
teaspoon
that
she
was
measuring
between
her
i
know
that
there
are
two
women
in
me
one
is
the
melrose
who
for
i
know
i
could
push
her
husband
out
of
sight
take
up
the
whole
business
of
doing
things
correctly
from
and
writing
notes
of
condolence
to
being
she
could
manage
a
hint
of
a
smile
under
swiftly
raised
lashes
being
presented
at
saint
james
she
said
in
five
years
she
would
be
an
admired
and
correct
and
popular
woman
and
perhaps
even
married
to
this
man
i
speak
of
the
other
woman
is
my
little
plain
french
mother
sort
who
was
a
servant
my
aunt
kind
and
norma
suddenly
felt
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
winked
them
away
with
an
april
smile
who
belongs
to
her
husband
who
likes
to
cook
and
tramp
about
in
the
woods
and
send
christmas
boxes
to
rose
babies
and
and
go
to
movies
and
picnics
and
that
the
sort
of
woman
i
chris
norma
ended
with
a
sudden
firmness
and
even
a
certain
relief
in
her
voice
i
just
discovered
it
i
been
spoiled
all
my
life
i
been
loved
too
much
i
think
but
i
thought
it
all
out
it
really
came
to
me
as
i
stood
beside
aunt
marianna
grave
and
you
do
know
how
happy
it
made
me
you
are
talking
very
recklessly
norma
chris
said
as
she
paused
in
his
quiet
definite
voice
you
are
now
there
is
no
such
difference
in
the
two
the
two
classes
to
call
them
that
as
you
fancy
the
richer
people
the
people
who
as
you
say
do
things
correctly
and
are
presented
at
saint
james
have
all
the
simple
pleasures
too
one
likes
moving
pictures
now
and
then
i
sure
we
often
have
picnics
in
the
summer
but
there
are
women
in
new
york
hundreds
of
them
who
would
give
the
last
twenty
years
of
their
lives
to
step
into
exactly
what
you
can
take
for
the
asking
now
you
will
have
annie
and
me
back
of
you
this
is
the
time
norma
for
me
to
say
just
how
entirely
you
will
have
my
championship
but
surely
you
know
he
was
just
what
he
had
always
been
finished
splendidly
sure
in
voice
and
manner
he
was
rich
he
was
popular
he
was
a
dictator
in
his
quiet
way
and
she
knew
even
if
the
shock
of
his
wife
sudden
going
had
pushed
his
thought
of
her
into
the
background
that
in
a
few
months
he
would
be
hovering
about
her
again
conventionally
freed
for
conventional
devotion
she
saw
all
this
and
for
the
first
time
she
saw
other
things
too
that
he
was
forty
and
looked
it
that
there
was
just
the
faintest
suggestion
of
thinning
in
his
smooth
hair
where
wolf
magnificent
mane
was
the
thickest
that
it
was
just
a
little
bloodless
this
decorous
mourning
that
had
so
instantly
engulfed
him
who
had
actually
told
her
another
man
wife
a
few
weeks
before
that
his
own
wife
was
dying
and
so
would
free
him
for
the
woman
he
loved
at
last
in
short
norma
mused
watching
him
as
he
fell
into
moody
silence
he
had
not
scrupled
to
break
the
spirit
of
his
bond
to
alice
he
had
not
hesitated
to
tell
norma
that
he
loved
her
when
only
norma
and
possibly
alice
might
suffer
from
his
disloyalty
but
when
the
sacred
letter
was
touched
the
sacred
outside
of
the
vessel
that
must
be
kept
clean
before
the
world
then
chris
was
instantly
the
impeccable
the
irreproachable
man
of
his
caste
again
it
was
all
part
of
the
superficial
smallness
of
that
world
where
arbitrary
form
ruled
where
to
send
a
wedding
invitation
printed
and
not
engraved
or
to
mispronounce
the
name
of
a
visiting
italian
tenor
or
russian
dancer
would
mark
the
noblest
woman
in
the
world
as
hopelessly
not
belonging
one
of
the
things
you
do
that
really
you
ought
to
norma
he
resumed
presently
in
quiet
distaste
is
assume
that
there
is
some
mysterious
difference
between
say
the
craigies
and
well
your
husband
the
craigies
are
enormously
wealthy
of
course
that
means
that
they
have
always
had
fine
service
music
travel
the
best
of
everything
in
educational
ways
friendship
with
the
best
people
and
those
things
an
advantage
generation
after
generation
it
absurd
to
deny
that
annie
children
for
example
have
any
real
and
tremendous
advantages
over
well
some
child
of
a
perfectly
respectable
family
that
manages
nicely
on
ten
thousand
a
year
but
that
annie
pleasures
are
not
as
real
or
that
there
must
necessarily
be
something
dangerous
something
detestable
in
the
life
of
the
best
people
is
ridiculous
that
just
what
i
do
assert
she
answered
bravely
it
may
not
be
so
for
you
for
you
were
born
to
it
but
when
you
lived
as
i
have
in
a
different
sort
of
life
with
people
to
whom
meals
and
the
rent
and
their
jobs
really
matter
this
sort
of
thing
does
seem
you
feel
like
bursting
out
laughing
and
saying
get
out
what
the
difference
if
i
make
calls
and
broaden
my
vowels
and
wear
just
this
and
that
and
say
just
this
and
that
it
all
seems
so
not
at
all
chris
said
really
roused
take
betty
doane
now
the
craigies
cousin
there
nothing
conventional
about
her
there
a
girl
who
dresses
like
a
man
all
summer
who
ran
away
from
school
and
tramped
into
hungary
dressed
as
a
gipsy
who
slapped
joe
brinckerhoff
face
for
him
last
winter
and
who
says
that
when
she
loves
a
man
she
going
off
with
him
no
matter
who
he
is
or
whether
he
married
or
not
or
whether
she
is
i
tell
you
what
she
sounds
like
to
me
chris
a
little
saucy
girl
of
about
eight
trying
to
see
how
naughty
she
can
be
why
that
said
norma
eagerly
that
not
that
is
like
when
you
know
you
ca
pay
more
than
thirty
dollars
rent
or
surprising
your
husband
with
a
new
thermos
bottle
that
he
did
think
he
could
afford
ah
well
if
you
slums
of
course
chris
said
coldly
but
nothing
can
prevent
your
inheriting
an
enormous
sum
of
money
norma
he
said
ending
the
conversation
and
in
six
months
you
feel
very
differently
there
is
just
one
chance
in
ten
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
i
might
she
said
to
herself
going
upstairs
after
chris
and
acton
who
presently
returned
to
the
had
begun
an
undertoned
conversation
and
with
a
sudden
flood
of
radiance
and
happiness
at
her
heart
she
sat
down
at
her
desk
and
wrote
to
wolf
the
note
said
wolf
dear
i
have
been
thinking
very
seriously
during
these
serious
days
and
i
am
writing
you
more
earnestly
than
i
ever
wrote
any
one
in
my
life
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
all
my
foolishness
and
let
me
come
back
to
you
i
have
missed
you
so
bitterly
and
thought
how
good
and
how
sensible
you
were
and
how
you
took
care
of
us
all
years
ago
and
gave
rose
and
me
skates
that
christmas
that
you
did
have
your
bicycle
mended
and
how
we
all
sat
up
and
cried
the
night
aunt
kate
was
sick
and
you
made
us
chocolate
by
the
rule
on
the
box
i
have
been
very
silly
and
i
thought
i
cared
and
perhaps
i
care
for
somebody
else
or
at
least
i
cared
for
what
he
stood
for
but
i
am
over
that
now
and
i
feel
so
much
older
and
as
if
i
needed
you
so
i
shall
have
a
tremendous
lot
of
money
and
we
just
have
to
decide
what
to
do
with
it
but
i
think
i
know
now
that
there
wo
be
any
particular
pleasure
in
spending
it
we
always
love
the
old
car
and
but
it
just
occurs
to
me
that
we
send
poor
kitty
barry
to
the
hospital
and
perhaps
ship
them
all
off
somewhere
where
they
get
better
aunt
kate
would
like
that
but
wo
you
come
up
wolf
and
see
me
i
meet
you
anywhere
and
we
can
talk
on
monday
or
tuesday
will
you
write
me
or
wire
me
i
ca
wait
to
see
you
she
cried
over
the
letter
and
over
the
signature
that
she
was
his
loving
nono
but
she
mailed
it
with
a
dancing
heart
the
road
had
been
dark
and
troubled
for
awhile
but
it
was
all
clear
now
the
wrong
had
been
the
whole
wretched
trouble
had
been
in
her
thinking
that
she
could
toss
aside
the
solemn
oath
that
she
had
taken
on
the
bewildering
day
of
her
marriage
almost
a
year
ago
never
since
old
old
days
of
childhood
when
she
and
wolf
and
rose
had
wiped
the
dishes
and
raked
the
yard
and
walked
a
mile
to
the
seats
at
the
circus
had
norma
been
so
sure
of
herself
and
so
happy
she
felt
herself
promoted
lifted
above
the
old
feelings
and
the
old
ways
and
dedicated
to
the
work
before
her
and
one
by
one
the
shadows
lifted
and
the
illusions
blew
away
and
she
could
see
her
way
clear
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
three
years
it
was
all
simple
all
right
all
just
as
she
would
have
had
it
she
would
never
be
a
petted
and
wealthy
little
leslie
she
would
never
be
a
leader
like
von
behrens
and
she
would
never
stand
before
the
world
as
the
woman
chosen
by
the
incomparable
chris
yet
she
was
the
last
melrose
and
she
knew
now
how
she
could
prove
herself
the
proudest
of
them
all
how
she
could
do
these
kinspeople
of
hers
a
greater
favour
than
any
they
had
ever
dreamed
of
doing
her
and
in
the
richness
of
renouncing
norma
knew
herself
to
be
for
the
first
time
truly
rich
chris
saw
the
difference
in
her
next
day
felt
the
new
dignity
the
sudden
transition
from
girl
to
woman
but
he
had
no
inkling
of
its
cause
leslie
saw
it
and
annie
but
norma
gave
them
no
clue
at
luncheon
annie
who
had
joined
them
for
the
meal
proposed
that
leslie
and
norma
and
the
liggetts
come
to
her
for
a
quiet
family
dinner
but
norma
begged
off
she
really
must
see
aunt
kate
and
would
seize
this
opportunity
to
go
home
for
a
night
but
leaving
the
table
norma
asked
chris
if
she
might
talk
business
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
they
sat
in
the
old
library
chris
sunk
in
a
great
leather
chair
smoking
cigarettes
norma
opposite
her
white
hands
clasped
on
the
blackness
of
her
simple
gown
and
her
eyes
moving
occasionally
from
their
quiet
study
of
the
fire
to
rest
on
chris
face
chris
she
said
i
thought
this
all
out
now
and
i
not
really
asking
your
advice
i
telling
you
what
i
am
going
to
do
i
going
to
california
with
wolf
in
a
week
or
two
that
the
first
thing
he
stared
at
her
blankly
and
as
the
minutes
of
silence
between
them
lengthened
norma
noticed
his
lips
compress
themselves
into
a
thin
colourless
line
but
she
returned
his
look
bravely
and
in
her
eyes
there
was
something
that
told
the
man
she
was
determined
in
her
decision
i
do
quite
follow
you
norma
he
said
at
last
with
difficulty
you
mean
that
all
the
plans
and
hopes
we
shared
and
discussed
he
faltered
a
moment
and
then
made
another
effort
now
that
whatever
obstacles
there
were
have
been
removed
and
you
and
i
are
free
to
fulfill
our
destinies
am
i
to
understand
that
that
you
are
going
back
to
your
husband
exactly
the
girl
answer
was
firm
and
determined
the
colour
fled
from
chris
face
and
a
cold
light
came
into
his
eye
his
jaw
stiffened
you
must
use
your
own
judgment
norma
he
answered
with
a
displeased
shrug
i
leave
with
you
or
send
you
my
power
of
attorney
the
girl
went
on
and
you
and
hendrick
as
executors
must
do
whatever
you
think
right
and
just
just
deposit
the
money
in
the
bank
i
see
chris
said
noncommittally
and
there
another
thing
norma
went
on
with
heightened
colour
i
do
want
either
leslie
or
aunt
annie
ever
to
know
what
you
and
i
know
chris
looked
at
her
frowning
slightly
that
impossible
of
course
he
said
what
are
they
going
to
think
they
think
nothing
norma
said
confidently
but
with
anxious
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
because
they
know
nothing
there
be
no
change
nothing
to
make
them
suspect
anything
but
great
god
you
do
seem
to
understand
norma
proofs
of
your
birth
of
your
rightful
heritage
your
identity
the
fact
that
you
are
theodore
child
must
be
shown
them
of
course
you
have
inherited
by
aunt
marianna
will
the
bulk
of
her
personal
fortune
but
besides
this
as
theodore
child
you
inherit
the
melrose
estate
and
leslie
must
turn
this
all
over
to
you
and
make
such
restitution
as
she
is
able
of
all
income
from
it
which
she
has
received
since
judge
lee
and
i
turned
it
over
to
her
on
her
eighteenth
birthday
no
that
just
what
she
is
to
do
i
will
get
exactly
what
is
mentioned
in
the
will
as
norma
sheridan
bonds
and
the
melrose
building
and
so
on
norma
broke
in
eagerly
and
that
enough
goodness
knows
and
a
thousand
times
more
than
wolf
and
i
ever
expected
to
have
aunt
annie
and
leslie
are
reconciled
to
that
but
for
the
rest
i
refuse
to
accept
it
i
do
want
it
i
never
been
so
unhappy
in
my
life
as
i
been
in
this
house
for
all
the
money
and
the
good
times
and
the
beautiful
clothes
and
if
that
much
did
make
me
happy
why
should
ten
times
more
is
it
far
far
better
all
round
you
are
talking
absurdities
said
chris
do
you
think
that
hendrick
and
i
could
consent
to
this
do
you
suppose
hendrick
does
know
it
chris
it
is
only
you
and
i
and
aunt
kate
that
all
and
if
i
do
this
and
swear
you
and
aunt
kate
to
secrecy
who
is
responsible
except
me
chris
shook
his
head
aunt
marianna
wished
you
righted
wished
you
to
take
your
place
as
theodore
daughter
it
is
her
wish
and
it
is
only
our
duty
but
think
a
minute
chris
think
a
minute
norma
said
eagerly
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
so
that
her
locked
hands
almost
touched
his
knees
it
her
wish
she
wanted
me
to
that
certain
and
i
do
know
but
do
you
really
think
she
wanted
leslie
to
be
shamed
and
crushed
and
to
take
away
the
money
leslie
has
had
all
her
life
to
shock
aunt
annie
and
stir
that
old
miserable
matter
up
with
hendrick
chris
you
think
that
the
one
thing
she
would
have
wished
and
prayed
would
have
been
that
somehow
the
matter
would
have
been
righted
without
hurting
any
one
chris
before
you
tear
the
whole
family
up
by
the
roots
what
harm
is
there
in
this
way
i
have
plenty
of
money
and
i
go
away
the
others
go
on
just
as
they
always
have
and
in
a
little
way
in
just
a
hundredth
part
i
pay
back
dear
old
aunt
marianna
for
all
the
worrying
and
planning
she
did
to
make
up
to
me
for
what
should
have
been
mine
and
was
leslie
please
help
me
to
do
this
chris
i
ca
be
happy
any
other
way
aunt
kate
will
approve
you
do
know
how
much
she
will
approve
and
it
will
repay
her
too
just
a
little
to
feel
that
it
all
known
now
and
that
it
has
turned
out
this
way
and
she
will
destroy
every
last
line
and
shred
of
letters
and
papers
and
the
photographs
she
said
she
had
and
it
will
all
be
over
for
ever
and
for
ever
you
put
a
terrible
responsibility
upon
me
chris
said
slowly
no
i
take
it
myself
norma
answered
he
had
gotten
to
his
feet
and
was
standing
at
the
hearth
and
now
she
rose
too
and
looked
eagerly
up
at
him
it
is
anything
like
the
responsibility
of
facing
the
world
with
the
whole
horrible
story
chris
was
silent
thinking
presently
he
turned
upon
her
the
old
smile
that
she
had
always
found
irresistible
and
put
his
two
hands
on
her
shoulders
you
are
a
wonderful
woman
norma
he
said
slowly
what
woman
in
the
world
but
you
would
do
that
yes
i
do
it
for
leslie
sake
and
acton
sake
and
because
i
believe
alice
would
think
it
as
wonderful
in
you
as
i
do
but
think
chris
said
think
just
a
few
days
norma
you
and
i
you
and
i
might
go
a
long
way
my
dear
if
he
had
said
it
even
at
this
hour
yesterday
he
might
have
shaken
her
for
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
the
old
chris
and
she
had
been
even
then
puzzled
and
confused
to
see
the
wisest
way
but
now
everything
was
changed
he
could
not
reach
her
now
even
when
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
said
that
this
was
one
of
their
rare
last
chances
to
be
alone
together
and
asked
if
it
must
be
she
looked
up
at
him
gravely
and
unashamedly
yes
it
must
be
dear
chris
she
said
with
a
little
emotion
although
i
hope
we
will
see
each
other
often
if
ever
wolf
and
i
come
back
engineers
live
in
canada
and
panama
and
india
and
alaska
you
know
and
we
never
will
know
we
are
coming
until
we
get
here
and
not
going
to
try
to
thank
you
chris
for
what
you
did
for
an
ignorant
silly
strange
little
girl
you
been
a
big
brother
to
me
all
these
last
years
and
something
more
of
course
norma
added
bravely
and
i
wo
say
i
ca
say
that
if
it
had
been
for
wolf
and
all
the
changes
this
year
changes
in
me
too
i
would
have
loved
you
all
my
life
but
there
no
place
that
you
could
take
me
as
wolf
divorced
wife
that
would
seem
worth
while
to
me
when
i
got
there
not
if
it
was
in
the
peerage
there
just
one
thing
that
i
want
to
say
too
norma
chris
said
suddenly
when
she
had
finished
i
not
good
enough
for
you
i
know
it
i
see
myself
as
i
am
sometimes
i
suppose
i
think
you
going
to
be
happy
and
god
knows
i
hope
so
perhaps
it
a
realer
life
your
husband
and
perhaps
a
man
who
works
for
his
wife
with
his
hands
and
his
head
has
got
something
on
us
other
fellows
after
all
i
often
wished
but
that
does
matter
now
but
i
want
you
to
know
always
remember
you
as
the
finest
woman
i
ever
knew
just
the
best
there
is
and
if
ever
i
hurt
you
forgive
me
wo
you
norma
and
and
let
me
kiss
you
she
raised
her
face
to
his
confidently
and
her
eyes
were
misty
when
she
went
upstairs
because
she
had
seen
that
his
were
wet
but
there
was
no
more
unhappiness
indeed
an
overwhelming
sense
that
everything
was
right
that
every
life
had
shifted
back
into
normal
and
manageable
and
infinitely
better
lines
went
with
her
as
she
walked
slowly
out
into
the
sunshine
and
wandered
in
the
general
direction
of
aunt
kate
as
she
left
the
old
melrose
home
the
big
limousine
was
standing
at
the
door
and
presently
annie
and
leslie
would
sweep
out
in
their
flowing
veils
and
crapes
and
whirl
off
to
the
von
behrens
mansion
but
norma
sheridan
was
content
to
walk
to
the
omnibus
and
to
take
the
jolting
front
seat
and
to
look
down
in
all
brotherly
love
and
companionship
at
the
moving
and
shifting
crowds
that
were
glorying
in
the
warm
spring
weather
to
be
busy
to
be
needed
to
be
loved
she
said
to
herself
that
was
the
sweet
of
life
and
it
could
not
be
taken
from
the
policeman
at
the
crossing
or
the
humblest
little
who
scampered
under
his
big
arm
or
bought
by
the
bored
women
in
limousines
who
furred
and
flowered
and
feathered
were
moving
from
the
matinée
to
the
tea
table

she
had
seen
the
material
advantages
of
life
fail
them
all
chapter
xxxv
aunt
kate
was
out
when
norma
reached
the
apartment
but
she
knew
that
the
key
was
always
on
the
top
of
the
door
frame
and
entered
the
familiar
old
rooms
without
any
trouble
but
she
saw
in
a
dismayed
flash
that
aunt
kate
was
not
coming
back
for
that
night
at
least
the
kitchen
window
had
been
left
four
inches
open
to
accommodate
the
cat
milk
and
bones
were
laid
in
waiting
and
a
note
in
the
bottle
notified
the
milkman
no
milk
until
there
was
also
a
note
in
pencil
on
the
bottom
of
an
for
the
nurses
who
rented
two
rooms
should
either
one
of
them
chance
to
come
in
and
be
hungry
she
was
to
eat
the
pudding
and
the
chicken
stew
and
get
herself
a
good
supper
norma
chuckling
a
little
got
herself
the
good
supper
instead
it
was
with
a
delightful
sense
of
solitude
and
irresponsibility
that
she
sat
eating
it
at
the
only
window
in
the
flat
that
possessed
a
good
view
the
kitchen
window
aunt
kate
she
decided
was
with
rose
who
had
no
telephone
norma
thought
that
she
would
wait
until
aunt
kate
got
home
the
next
day
rather
than
chance
the
long
trip
to
the
oranges
again
an
alternative
would
have
been
to
go
to
aunt
annie
house
but
somehow
the
thought
of
the
big
silent
handsome
place
with
the
men
in
evening
wear
aunt
annie
and
leslie
in
just
the
correct
mourning
décolleté
and
the
conversation
decorously
funereal
did
not
appeal
to
her
instead
it
seemed
a
real
adventure
to
dine
alone
and
after
dinner
to
put
on
a
less
conspicuous
hat
and
coat
and
slip
out
into
the
streets
and
walk
about
in
her
freedom
the
night
was
soft
and
balmy
and
the
sidewalks
filled
with
sauntering
groups
enjoying
the
first
delicious
promise
of
summer
as
much
as
norma
did
the
winter
had
been
long
and
cold
and
snowy
great
masses
of
thawing
ice
from
rivers
were
slowly
drifting
down
the
surface
of
the
hudson
and
the
trees
were
still
bare
but
the
air
was
warm
and
the
breezes
lifted
and
stirred
the
tender
darkness
above
her
head
with
a
summery
sweetness
norma
loved
all
the
world
the
world
that
was
revelling
in
idleness
and
fresh
air
romance
seemed
all
about
her
the
doorways
into
which
children
reluctantly
vanished
the
gossiping
women
coming
back
from
bakery
or
market
the
candy
stores
flooded
with
light
and
crowded
with
young
people
who
were
having
the
brightest
and
most
thrilling
moments
of
all
their
lives
over
banana
specials
and
chocolate
sundaes
the
usual
whirlpools
eddied
about
the
subway
openings
and
houses
the
usual
lovers
locked
arms
in
the
high
rocking
darkness
of
the
omnibus
tops
and
looked
down
in
apathetic
indifference
upon
the
disappointment
of
other
lovers
at
the
crossings
in
the
bright
windows
of
dairy
restaurants
grapefruit
were
piled
and
big
baked
apples
ranged
in
saucers
and
beyond
there
were
hungry
men
leaning
far
over
the
table
while
they
discussed
doughnuts
and
strong
coffee
and
shook
open
evening
papers
she
and
wolf
had
studied
it
all
for
years
it
was
sordid
and
crowded
and
cheap
perhaps
but
it
was
honest
and
happy
too
and
it
was
real
there
was
no
affectation
here
even
the
premature
spring
hats
and
the
rouge
and
the
high
heels
were
an
ingenuous
bid
for
just
a
little
notice
just
a
little
admiration
just
a
little
longer
youth
sauntering
along
in
the
very
heart
of
it
hearing
the
flirtation
the
theatrical
chatter
the
homely
gossip
about
her
norma
knew
that
she
was
at
home
leslie
perhaps
might
have
loathed
it
had
she
been
put
down
in
the
midst
of
it
to
aunt
annie
it
would
always
seem
entirely
beneath
even
contempt
but
norma
realized
as
she
slipped
into
church
for
a
few
minutes
as
she
dropped
a
coin
into
a
beggar
tin
cup
as
she
entered
into
casual
conversation
with
the
angry
mother
of
a
defiant
boy
that
this
to
her
was
life
it
was
life
to
work
to
plan
to
marry
and
bear
children
to
wrest
her
own
home
from
unfavourable
conditions
and
help
her
own
man
to
win
she
would
live
because
she
would
care
care
deeply
how
wolf
fared
in
his
work
how
her
house
prospered
how
her
children
developed
she
would
not
be
aunt
annie
sort
of
woman
sort
she
would
be
herself
judged
not
by
what
she
had
but
by
what
she
could
do
what
she
could
give
and
that
the
kind
of
woman
i
am
after
all
she
said
to
herself
rejoicingly
the
child
of
a
french
maid
and
a
spoiled
rich
young
man
but
no
i
not
their
child
i
aunt
kate
just
as
much
as
rose
and
wolf
are
and
at
the
thought
of
wolf
she
smiled
wo
wolf
sheridan
his
when
she
reached
street
she
turned
east
and
went
past
the
familiar
door
of
the
opera
house
it
was
a
special
performance
and
the
waiting
line
stretched
from
the
box
office
down
the
street
and
around
the
corner
into
the
dark
they
would
only
be
able
to
buy
standing
room
these
patient
happy
music
lovers
who
grew
weary
and
cold
waiting
for
their
treat
and
even
standing
they
would
be
behind
an
immovable
crowd
they
would
catch
only
occasional
glimpses
of
the
stage
but
norma
told
herself
that
she
would
rather
be
in
that
line
than
yawningly
deciding
as
she
had
so
often
seen
annie
decide
that
she
would
perhaps
rustle
into
the
box
at
ten
for
the
third
act
although
it
was
rather
a
bore
she
flitted
near
enough
to
see
the
general
stir
and
to
see
once
more
the
sign
no
footmen
allowed
in
this
lobby
and
then
smiling
at
the
old
memories
she
slipped
away
into
the
darkness
drinking
in
insatiably
the
intimate
friendliness
of
the
big
city
and
the
spring
night
chapter
xxxvi
it
was
ten
the
next
day
a
silent
gray
day
when
aunt
kate
let
herself
into
the
apartment
and
let
out
to
use
her
own
phrase
a
startled
exclamation
at
finding
her
young
deeply
asleep
in
her
bed
norma
a
vision
of
cloudy
dark
tumbled
hair
and
beautiful
sleepy
blue
eyes
the
older
woman
in
a
rapturous
embrace
and
explained
that
she
had
come
home
the
night
before
and
eaten
the
chicken
stew
and
perhaps
overslept
at
any
rate
would
love
some
coffee
something
faintly
shadowed
in
her
aunt
welcome
however
was
immediately
apparent
and
norma
asked
with
a
trace
of
anxiety
if
rose
babies
were
well
for
answer
her
aunt
merely
asked
if
wolf
had
telephoned
wolf
said
wolf
wife
is
he
home
my
dear
sheridan
said
he
going
he
gone
to
california
norma
did
not
move
but
the
colour
went
out
of
her
face
and
the
brightness
from
her
eyes
gone
she
whispered
well
he
goes
at
six
at
six
norma
leaped
from
her
bed
stood
with
clenched
hands
and
wild
eyes
thinking
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
it
minutes
past
ten
she
breathed
where
does
he
leave
rose
and
i
were
to
see
him
at
the
grand
central
at
quarter
past
five
his
mother
began
catching
the
contagious
excitement
but
darling
i
do
know
where
you
can
get
him
before
that
here
let
me
do
that
she
added
for
norma
had
dashed
into
the
kitchen
and
was
measuring
coffee
recklessly
a
brown
stream
trickled
to
the
floor
oh
lord
lord
help
me
to
get
hold
of
him
somewhere
she
heard
norma
breathe
and
you
were
going
to
let
me
know
but
it
my
fault
she
said
putting
her
hands
over
her
face
and
rocking
to
and
fro
in
desperate
suspense
oh
how
can
i
get
him
i
must
oh
aunt
kate
oh
i
not
even
dressed
and
that
clock
says
ten
aunt
kate
will
you
help
me
norma
my
darling
her
aunt
said
arresting
the
whirling
little
figure
with
a
big
arm
and
looking
down
at
her
with
all
the
love
and
sadness
of
her
great
heart
in
her
face
why
do
you
want
to
see
him
dear
he
told
me
he
had
to
tell
his
mother
poor
boy
for
his
heart
is
broken
that
you
were
not
going
with
him
oh
but
aunt
kate
he
have
to
wait
for
me
norma
said
stamping
a
slippered
foot
and
beginning
to
cry
with
hurt
and
helplessness
oh
wo
you
help
me
you
always
help
me
do
do
mind
what
i
said
to
wolf
you
know
how
silly
i
am
but
please
but
baby
you
sure
sheridan
asked
feeling
as
if
ice
that
had
been
packed
about
her
heart
for
days
was
breaking
and
stirring
and
as
if
the
exquisite
pain
of
it
would
kill
her
do
hurt
him
again
norma
but
he
going
off
without
me
norma
wailed
rushing
to
the
bathroom
and
pinning
her
magnificent
mass
of
soft
dark
hair
into
a
stern
knob
for
her
bath
aunt
kate
i
always
loved
wolf
always
she
said
passionately
and
if
he
really
had
gone
away
without
me
i
think
it
would
have
broken
my
heart
you
how
i
love
him
we
catch
him
somewhere
i
know
we
will
we
telephone
or
else
harry
she
trailed
into
the
kitchen
ten
minutes
later
i
telephoned
for
a
taxi
aunt
kate
and
we
find
him
somewhere
she
said
gulping
hot
coffee
appreciatively
i
must
i
something
to
tell
him
but
i
have
to
tell
you
everything
in
the
cab
to
begin
with
it
all
over
i
done
with
the
melroses
i
appreciate
all
they
did
for
me
and
i
appreciate
your
worrying
and
planning
about
that
old
secret
but
i
made
up
my
mind
whatever
you
have
of
letters
and
papers
and
proofs
i
want
you
please
to
do
the
family
a
last
favour
by
burning
every
last
shred
i
told
chris
i
wo
touch
a
cent
of
the
money
except
what
aunt
marianna
left
me
and
i
never
never
never
intend
to
say
one
more
word
on
the
subject
thousands
did
make
me
happy
so
why
should
a
million
the
best
thing
my
father
ever
did
for
me
was
to
give
my
mother
a
chance
to
bring
me
here
to
you
she
had
gotten
into
her
aunt
lap
as
she
spoke
and
was
rubbing
her
cheek
against
the
older
roughened
cheek
and
punctuating
her
conversation
with
little
kisses
sheridan
looked
at
her
and
blinked
and
seemed
to
find
nothing
to
say
perhaps
some
day
when
it
hot
and
the
jelly
does
jell
and
the
children
break
the
fence
pursued
norma
i
will
be
sorry
i
much
sense
and
i
may
feel
that
i
been
a
fool
but
then
i
just
want
you
to
remind
me
of
leslie
and
the
craigies
or
better
of
what
a
beast
i
am
myself
in
that
atmosphere
so
it
all
over
aunt
kate
and
if
wolf
will
forgive
me
and
he
always
does
he
bitterly
hurt
this
time
nono
said
her
aunt
gently
norma
looked
a
little
anxious
i
wrote
him
in
philadelphia
she
said
but
he
wo
get
that
letter
oh
aunt
kate
if
we
do
find
him
but
we
will
if
i
have
to
walk
up
to
him
in
the
station
the
last
minute
and
stop
him
ah
norma
you
love
him
his
mother
said
in
a
great
burst
of
thankfulness
and
may
god
be
thanked
for
all
his
goodness
that
all
i
care
about
that
you
love
him
and
that
you
two
will
be
together
again
we
get
hold
of
him
dear
somehow
but
my
darling
she
added
coming
presently
to
the
bedroom
door
to
see
the
dashing
little
feathered
hat
go
on
and
the
dotted
veil
pinned
with
exquisite
nicety
over
norma
glowing
face
and
the
belted
brown
coat
and
loose
brown
fur
rapidly
assumed
you
not
wearing
your
mourning
not
norma
said
abstractedly
and
aloud
she
read
a
list
bank
grand
central
new
notary
for
power
of

kitty
barry
telephone
chris
leslie
annie
telephone
regina
about
trunks
can
we
be
back
here
at
say
four
aunt
kate
but
what
all
that
for
her
aunt
asked
dazedly
norma
looked
at
a
check
book
put
it
in
her
coat
pocket
then
as
her
aunt
question
reached
her
preoccupied
mind
she
turned
toward
her
with
a
puzzled
expression
why
aunt
kate
you
do
seem
to
understand
i
going
with
wolf
to
california
this
evening
chapter
xxxvii
it
was
exactly
nineteen
minutes
past
five
when
wolf
sheridan
walked
into
the
grand
central
station
that
afternoon
he
had
stopped
outside
to
send
his
wife
some
flowers
and
just
a
brief
line
of
farewell
and
he
was
thinking
so
hard
of
norma
that
it
seemed
natural
that
the
woman
who
was
coming
toward
him
in
the
great
central
concourse
should
suggest
her
the
woman
was
pretty
too
and
wore
the
sort
of
dashing
little
hat
that
norma
often
wore
and
there
was
something
so
familiar
about
the
belted
brown
coat
and
the
soft
brown
furs
that
wolf
heart
gave
a
great
plunge
and
began
to
ache
ache
ache
hopelessly
again
the
brown
coat
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
he
saw
that
the
wearer
was
indeed
his
wife
she
had
dewy
violets
in
her
belt
and
her
violet
eyes
were
dewy
too
and
her
face
paled
suddenly
as
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
what
norma
all
that
tired
and
panicky
afternoon
had
planned
to
say
to
wolf
on
this
occasion
was
something
like
this
wolf
if
you
ever
loved
me
and
if
i
ever
did
anything
that
made
you
happy
and
if
all
these
years
when
i
have
been
your
little
sister
and
your
chum
and
your
wife
mean
anything
to
you
do
push
me
away
now
i
am
sorrier
for
my
foolishness
and
more
ashamed
of
it
than
you
can
possibly
be
i
think
it
was
never
anything
but
weakness
and
vanity
that
made
me
want
to
flirt
with
chris
liggett
i
think
that
if
he
had
once
stopped
flattering
me
and
if
ever
our
meetings
had
been
anything
but
stolen
fruit
as
it
were
i
would
have
seen
how
utterly
blind
i
was
different
now
wolf
i
know
that
what
i
felt
for
him
was
only
shallow
vanity
and
that
what
i
feel
for
you
is
the
deepest
and
realest
love
that
any
woman
ever
knew
there
nothing
no
minute
of
the
day
or
night
when
i
do
need
you
there
nothing
that
you
think
that
is
what
i
think
i
want
to
go
west
with
you
and
make
a
home
there
and
when
you
go
to
china
or
go
to
india
i
want
you
to
go
because
your
wife
has
helped
you
because
you
have
had
happy
years
of
working
and
experimenting
and
picnicking
and
planning
with
me
it
all
over
wolf
that
melrose
business
that
dream
i
said
to
them
and
they
have
to
me
and
they
know
i
never
coming
back
i
a
sheridan
now
really
and
truly
for
ever
and
in
the
lonesome
and
bitter
days
in
which
his
great
dream
had
come
true
without
norma
to
share
it
days
in
which
he
had
been
thinking
of
her
as
affiliated
more
and
more
with
the
element
he
despised
identified
more
and
more
with
the
man
who
had
wrecked
or
tried
to
wreck
her
life
wolf
had
imagined
this
meeting
and
imagined
her
as
tentatively
holding
out
the
olive
branch
of
peace
and
he
had
had
time
to
formulate
exactly
what
he
should
answer
to
such
an
appeal
i
sorry
norma
he
had
imagined
himself
saying
i
terribly
sorry
but
just
talking
does
undo
these
things
just
that
you
did
mean
it
and
that
it
all
over
no
married
life
ca
be
picked
up
and
put
down
again
like
a
coat
you
my
wife
and
god
knows
i
worshipped
you
heart
and
soul
if
some
day
these
people
get
tired
of
you
or
you
get
tired
of
them
that
be
different
but
you
cut
me
too
deep
you
killed
a
part
of
me
and
it
wo
come
alive
again
i
been
through
hell
wondering
what
you
were
doing
what
you
were
going
to
do
i
never
should
have
married
you
now
let
call
it
all
quits
and
get
out
of
it
the
best
way
we
can
but
when
he
saw
her
the
familiar
lovely
face
that
he
had
loved
for
so
many
years
when
he
felt
the
little
gloved
hand
on
his
arm
and
realized
that
somehow
out
of
the
utter
desolation
and
loneliness
of
the
big
city
she
had
come
to
him
again
that
she
was
here
mistily
smiling
at
him
and
he
could
touch
her
and
hear
her
voice
everything
else
vanished
as
if
it
had
never
been
and
he
put
his
big
arm
about
her
hungrily
and
kissed
her
and
they
were
both
in
tears
oh
wolf
norma
faltered
the
dry
spaces
of
her
soul
flooding
with
springtime
warmth
and
greenness
and
a
great
happiness
sweeping
away
all
consciousness
of
the
place
in
which
they
stood
and
the
interested
eyes
about
them
oh
wolf
she
thought
that
she
added
would
you
have
gone
away
without
me
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
words
were
not
needed
now
nono
you
love
me
he
whispered
or
perhaps
he
only
thought
he
enunciated
the
phrase
for
although
norma
answered
it
was
not
audibly
neither
of
them
ever
remembered
anything
coherent
of
that
first
five
minutes
in
which
momentous
questions
were
settled
between
admiring
comment
upon
wolf
new
coat
and
in
which
they
laughed
and
cried
and
clung
together
in
shameless
indifference
to
the
general
public
but
presently
they
were
calm
enough
to
talk
and
wolf
first
constructive
remark
not
even
now
very
steady
or
clear
was
that
he
must
put
off
his
going
get
hold
of
voorhies
somehow
but
no
norma
said
even
while
they
were
dashing
toward
the
telegraph
office
she
had
already
bought
her
ticket
she
was
going
too
this
very
hour
wolf
brought
her
up
short
ecstatic
bewilderment
in
his
face
but
your
trunks
regina
i
tell
you
it
all
settled
regina
sends
them
on
after
me
and
i
got
a
new
big
and
my
old
brown
one
that
plenty
for
the
present
they
checked
here
in
the
but
we
they
had
started
automatically
to
rush
toward
the
but
now
he
brought
her
up
short
again
it
now
he
muttered
turning
briskly
in
still
another
direction
let
me
have
your
ticket
we
have
to
try
for
a
section
it
pretty
late
but
there
may
be
cancellations
oh
but
see
wolf
i
been
here
since
four
i
got
the
a
in
car
she
brought
forth
an
envelope
and
flashed
a
flimsy
bit
of
coloured
paper
for
a
third
time
wolf
checked
his
hurried
rushing
and
they
both
broke
into
delicious
laughter
i
been
at
it
all
day
with
aunt
kate
norma
said
proudly
i
been
to
banks
and
to
judge
lee
office
and
i
seen
annie
and
leslie
and
i
bought
a
new
wrapper
and
a
and
oh
and
i
saw
kitty
barry
and
i
got
you
a
book
for
the
train
and
i
got
myself
one
oh
norma
wolf
said
his
eyes
filling
you
little
adorable
idiot
do
you
know
how
i
love
you
my
darling
my
own
wife
do
you
know
that
i
want
to
die
i
so
happy
do
you
realize
what
it
going
to
mean
to
us
poking
about
chicago
and
sending
home
little
presents
to
rose
and
the
kids
and
reaching
san
francisco
and
going
up
to
the
big
mine
do
you
realize
that
i
feel
like
a
man
out
of
jail
like
a
kid
who
knows
it
saturday
morning
well
i
feel
that
way
too
norma
smiled
and
now
she
added
in
a
businesslike
tone
we
got
to
look
for
aunt
kate
and
rose
and
get
our
bags
and
leslie
said
that
it
was
a
good
idea
to
wire
a
chicago
hotel
for
a
room
just
for
the
few
hours
before
the
overland
pulls
out
because
one
feels
so
dirty
and
tired
do
you
realize
that
i
never
spent
a
night
on
a
pullman
yet
and
i
turn
in
the
ticket
for
my
lower
wolf
said
we
have
dinner
on
board
so
that
all
right
oh
wolf
and
wo
that
be
fun
norma
exulted
and
then
joyously
oh
there
they
are
and
she
fled
across
the
great
space
to
meet
rose
pretty
and
matronly
at
the
foot
of
the
great
stairway
and
harry
grinning
and
proud
with
his
little
sturdy
boy
in
his
arms
and
aunt
kate
beaming
utter
happiness
upon
them
all
and
then
ensued
that
thrilling
time
of
incoherencies
and
confusions
laughter
and
tears
to
which
the
big
place
is
by
nature
dedicated
they
were
parting
so
lightly
but
they
all
knew
that
there
would
be
changes
before
they
six
met
again
to
aunt
kate
holding
close
the
child
whose
destinies
had
been
so
strangely
entangled
with
her
own
the
moment
held
a
poignant
pleasure
as
well
as
pain
she
was
launched
now
their
imperious
beloved
youngest
she
had
been
taken
to
the
and
shown
the
world
at
her
feet
and
she
had
chosen
bravely
and
wisely
chosen
her
part
of
service
and
simplicity
and
love
life
would
go
on
changes
indeed
and
growth
everywhere
but
she
knew
that
the
years
would
bring
her
back
a
new
norma
a
developed
sweetened
woman
and
a
new
wolf
his
hard
childhood
all
swept
away
and
forgotten
in
the
richness
and
beauty
of
this
woman
love
and
companionship
and
she
was
content
and
wolf
she
told
you
about
kitty
every
month
as
long
as
they
need
it
rose
said
crying
heartily
as
she
clung
to
her
brother
why
the
most
wonderful
thing
i
ever
heard
poor
louis
barry
ca
believe
it
he
broke
down
completely
and
kitty
was
crying
and
kissing
the
children
and
she
knelt
down
and
put
her
arms
about
norma
knees
and
norma
was
crying
too
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
she
never
told
me
a
word
about
it
wolf
said
trying
to
laugh
and
blinking
as
he
looked
at
her
a
few
feet
away
one
of
her
arms
was
about
his
mother
her
hand
was
in
harry
her
face
close
to
the
rosy
baby
face
wolf
his
sister
said
earnestly
drying
her
eyes
it
will
bring
a
blessing
on
your
own
children
ah
rose
he
answered
quickly
pray
that
there
is
one
some
day
one
of
our
own
as
sweet
as
yours
are
ah
you
have
everything
you
two
never
fear
she
said
radiantly
and
then
a
gate
opened
and
the
bustle
about
them
thickened
and
laughing
faces
grew
pale
and
last
words
faltered
harry
gave
rose
the
baby
and
put
his
arm
about
rose
mother
and
they
watched
them
go
the
leading
with
the
wolf
carrying
another
norma
on
his
arm
twisting
herself
about
at
the
very
last
second
to
smile
an
april
smile
over
her
shoulder
and
wave
the
green
jade
handle
of
her
slim
little
umbrella
there
was
just
a
glimpse
of
wolf
old
boyish
proud
protecting
smile
and
then
his
head
drooped
toward
his
companion
and
the
surging
crowd
shut
them
out
of
sight
then
rose
immediately
was
concerned
for
the
little
baby
would
it
be
wiser
to
go
straight
home
just
for
fear
that
mrs
noon
might
have
fallen
asleep
and
the
house
caught
on
fire
sheridan
blew
her
nose
and
dried
her
eyes
and
straightened
her
widow
bonnet
and
cleared
her
throat
and
agreed
that
it
would
and
they
all
went
away
but
there
was
another
watcher
who
had
shared
unseen
all
this
last
and
who
stood
immovable
to
the
last
second
until
the
iron
gates
had
actually
clashed
shut
it
was
a
man
in
an
irreproachably
fitting
overcoat
who
finally
turned
away
fitting
his
eyeglasses
on
their
black
ribbon
firmly
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
sighing
just
a
little
as
he
went
back
to
the
sidewalk
and
climbed
into
a
waiting
roadster
even
after
he
took
his
seat
at
the
wheel
he
made
no
effort
to
start
the
car
but
sat
slowly
drawing
on
his
heavy
gloves
and
staring
abstractedly
at
the
dull
uninteresting
stretch
of
street
before
him
where
a
dismal
spring
wind
was
stirring
chaff
and
papers
about
the
subway
entrance
and
surface
cars
were
grinding
and
ringing
on
the
curve
it
looked
dull
and
empty
dull
and
empty
he
thought
she
had
been
very
happy
looking
up
at
her
man
kissing
her
people
she
was
a
remarkable
woman
norma
a
remarkable
woman
norma
he
said
she
will
make
him
a
wonderful
wife
she
will
help
him
to
go
a
long
way
and
she
never
would
have
had
patience
for
formal
living
it
was
in
her
but
he
remembered
what
was
in
her
what
eager
gaiety
what
hunger
for
new
impressions
what
courage
in
seizing
her
dilemmas
the
instant
she
saw
them
he
remembered
the
flash
of
her
eyes
and
the
curve
of
her
proud
little
mouth
theodore
had
more
charm
than
any
of
them
he
said
and
she
is
like
him
well
perhaps
i
meet
somebody
like
her
some
day
and
the
story
will
have
a
different
ending
but
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
there
was
nobody
like
her
and
that
she
had
gone
out
of
his
life
for
ever
they
had
hung
the
belted
brown
coat
over
the
big
new
gray
one
in
the
and
norma
had
brushed
her
hair
and
wolf
had
shoved
the
under
the
seats
and
they
had
gone
straight
into
the
and
were
at
a
lighted
little
shining
table
by
this
time
wolf
had
had
no
lunch
norma
was
she
said
starving
they
ordered
their
meal
just
as
the
train
drew
out
of
the
underground
arcades
and
swept
over
the
city
in
the
twilight
of
the
dull
sunless
day
norma
looked
down
and
joy
and
a
vague
heartache
struggled
within
her
the
little
city
blocks
draped
with
their
frail
tangles
of
were
as
as
toys
in
the
streets
children
were
screaming
and
racing
at
the
doorways
women
loitered
and
talked
great
trucks
lumbered
in
and
out
among
surging
pedestrians
and
women
and
children
stood
before
the
displays
of
oranges
and
cabbages
and
trickled
in
and
out
of
the
markets
where
cheap
cuts
were
advertised
in
great
chalk
signs
on
the
windows
red
brick
yellow
brick
gray
cement
the
streets
fled
by
the
dear
familiar
streets
that
she
and
wolf
and
she
and
rose
had
tramped
and
explored
in
the
burning
dry
heat
of
july
in
the
flutter
of
november
first
snows
say
to
it
wolf
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
we
see
new
york
again
wolf
looked
down
grinning
then
as
they
left
the
city
and
the
dusk
deepened
his
eyes
went
toward
the
river
went
toward
the
vague
and
waiting
west
the
palisades
lay
a
wide
bar
of
soft
dull
gray
against
the
paler
of
the
sky
above
them
bare
trees
were
etched
sharply
and
beneath
them
was
the
satiny
surface
of
the
full
hudson
it
was
still
water
and
the
river
was
smooth
enough
to
give
back
a
clear
reflection
of
the
buildings
and
the
wharves
on
the
opposite
shore
and
the
floating
ice
from
the
north
looked
like
rounded
bunches
of
foam
arrested
on
the
shining
waters
suddenly
the
sinking
sun
evaded
the
smother
of
cloud
and
flashed
out
red
and
shining
for
only
a
few
brilliant
minutes
it
caught
window
glass
like
flame
twinkled
and
smouldered
in
the
mirror
of
the
river
and
lighted
the
under
edges
of
low
clouds
with
a
crisp
touch
of
apricot
and
pink
wet
streets
shone
joyously
doves
rose
in
a
circling
whirl
from
a
roof
and
all
the
world
shone
and
sparkled
in
the
last
breath
of
the
spring
day
then
dusk
came
indeed
and
the
villages
across
the
river
were
strung
with
increasing
lights
and
in
the
tender
opal
softness
of
the
evening
sky
norma
saw
a
great
star
hanging
that
a
good
omen
that
our
own
little
star
she
said
softly
to
herself
she
looked
up
to
see
wolf
smiling
at
her
and
the
smile
in
her
own
eyes
deepened
and
she
stretched
a
warm
and
comradely
hand
to
him
across
the
little
table
the
end
