book
i
chapter
you
hear
me
saxon
come
on
along
what
if
it
is
the
bricklayers
have
gentlemen
friends
there
and
so
you
the
al
vista
band
be
along
an
you
know
it
plays
heavenly
an
you
just
love
dancin
twenty
feet
away
a
stout
elderly
woman
interrupted
the
persuasions
the
elderly
woman
back
was
turned
and
the
back
loose
bulging
and
misshapen
began
a
convulsive
heaving
gawd
she
cried
out
o
gawd
she
flung
wild
glances
like
those
of
an
entrapped
animal
up
and
down
the
big
whitewashed
room
that
panted
with
heat
and
that
was
thickly
humid
with
the
steam
that
sizzled
from
the
damp
cloth
under
the
irons
of
the
many
ironers
from
the
girls
and
women
near
her
all
swinging
irons
steadily
but
at
high
pace
came
quick
glances
and
labor
efficiency
suffered
to
the
extent
of
a
score
of
suspended
or
inadequate
movements
the
elderly
woman
cry
had
caused
a
tremor
of
to
pass
among
the
ironers
of
fancy
starch
she
gripped
herself
and
her
iron
with
a
visible
effort
and
dabbed
futilely
at
the
frail
frilled
garment
on
the
board
under
her
hand
i
thought
she
again
did
you
the
girl
said
it
a
shame
a
woman
of
her
age
and
condition
saxon
answered
as
she
frilled
a
lace
ruffle
with
a
hot
her
movements
were
delicate
safe
and
swift
and
though
her
face
was
wan
with
fatigue
and
exhausting
heat
there
was
no
slackening
in
her
pace
an
her
with
seven
an
two
of
in
reform
school
the
girl
at
the
next
board
sniffed
sympathetic
agreement
but
you
just
got
to
come
to
weasel
park
saxon
the
bricklayers
is
always
lively
races
real
irish
jiggin
an
everything
an
the
floor
of
the
pavilion
but
the
elderly
woman
brought
another
interruption
she
dropped
her
iron
on
the
shirtwaist
clutched
at
the
board
fumbled
it
caved
in
at
the
knees
and
hips
and
like
a
sack
collapsed
on
the
floor
her
long
shriek
rising
in
the
pent
room
to
the
acrid
smell
of
scorching
cloth
the
women
at
the
boards
near
to
her
scrambled
first
to
the
hot
iron
to
save
the
cloth
and
then
to
her
while
the
forewoman
hurried
belligerently
down
the
aisle
the
women
farther
away
continued
unsteadily
at
their
work
losing
movements
to
the
extent
of
a
to
the
totality
of
the
efficiency
of
the
room
enough
to
kill
a
dog
the
girl
muttered
thumping
her
iron
down
on
its
rest
with
reckless
determination
workin
girls
life
ai
what
cracked
up
me
to
quit
that
what
i
comin
mary
saxon
uttered
the
other
name
with
a
reproach
so
profound
that
she
was
compelled
to
rest
her
own
iron
for
emphasis
and
so
lose
a
dozen
movements
mary
flashed
a
look
across
i
did
mean
it
saxon
she
whimpered
honest
i
did
i
never
go
that
way
but
i
leave
it
to
you
if
a
day
like
this
do
get
on
anybody
nerves
listen
to
that
the
stricken
woman
on
her
back
drumming
her
heels
on
the
floor
was
shrieking
persistently
and
monotonously
like
a
mechanical
siren
two
women
clutching
her
under
the
arms
were
dragging
her
down
the
aisle
she
drummed
and
shrieked
the
length
of
it
the
door
opened
and
a
vast
muffled
roar
of
machinery
burst
in
and
in
the
roar
of
it
the
drumming
and
the
shrieking
were
drowned
ere
the
door
swung
shut
remained
of
the
episode
only
the
scorch
of
cloth
drifting
ominously
through
the
air
it
sickenin
said
mary
and
thereafter
for
a
long
time
the
many
irons
rose
and
fell
the
pace
of
the
room
in
no
wise
diminished
while
the
forewoman
strode
the
aisles
with
a
threatening
eye
for
incipient
breakdown
and
hysteria
occasionally
an
ironer
lost
the
stride
for
an
instant
gasped
or
sighed
then
caught
it
up
again
with
weary
determination
the
long
summer
day
waned
but
not
the
heat
and
under
the
raw
flare
of
electric
light
the
work
went
on
by
nine
the
first
women
began
to
go
home
the
mountain
of
fancy
starch
had
been
demolished
all
save
the
few
remnants
here
and
there
on
the
boards
where
the
ironers
still
labored
saxon
finished
ahead
of
mary
at
whose
board
she
paused
on
the
way
out
saturday
night
an
another
week
gone
mary
said
mournfully
her
young
cheeks
pallid
and
hollowed
her
black
eyes
and
tired
what
think
you
made
saxon
twelve
and
a
quarter
was
the
answer
just
touched
with
pride
and
more
if
it
was
for
that
fake
bunch
of
my
i
got
to
pass
it
to
you
mary
congratulated
you
a
sure
fierce
hustler
just
eat
it
up
me
i
only
ten
an
a
half
an
for
a
hard
week
see
you
on
the
sure
now
we
can
just
fool
around
until
the
dancin
begins
a
lot
of
my
gentlemen
friends
be
there
in
the
two
blocks
from
the
laundry
where
an
showed
a
gang
of
toughs
on
the
corner
saxon
quickened
her
pace
unconsciously
her
face
set
and
hardened
as
she
passed
she
did
not
catch
the
words
of
the
muttered
comment
but
the
rough
laughter
it
raised
made
her
guess
and
warmed
her
checks
with
resentful
blood
three
blocks
more
turning
once
to
left
and
once
to
right
she
walked
on
through
the
night
that
was
already
growing
cool
on
either
side
were
workingmen
houses
of
weathered
wood
the
ancient
paint
grimed
with
the
dust
of
years
conspicuous
only
for
cheapness
and
ugliness
dark
it
was
but
she
made
no
mistake
the
familiar
sag
and
screeching
reproach
of
the
front
gate
welcome
under
her
hand
she
went
along
the
narrow
walk
to
the
rear
avoided
the
missing
step
without
thinking
about
it
and
entered
the
kitchen
where
a
solitary
flickered
she
turned
it
up
to
the
best
of
its
flame
it
was
a
small
room
not
disorderly
because
of
lack
of
furnishings
to
disorder
it
the
plaster
discolored
by
the
steam
of
many
was
crisscrossed
with
cracks
from
the
big
earthquake
of
the
previous
spring
the
floor
was
ridged
and
uneven
and
in
front
of
the
stove
it
was
worn
through
and
repaired
with
a
hammered
flat
and
double
a
sink
a
dirty
several
chairs
and
a
wooden
table
completed
the
picture
an
crunched
under
her
foot
as
she
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
on
the
frayed
oilcloth
a
supper
waited
she
attempted
the
cold
beans
thick
with
grease
but
gave
them
up
and
buttered
a
slice
of
bread
the
rickety
house
shook
to
a
heavy
prideless
tread
and
through
the
inner
door
came
sarah
her
face
lined
with
care
and
fat
petulance
huh
it
you
she
grunted
a
greeting
i
just
could
keep
things
warm
such
a
day
i
near
died
of
the
heat
an
little
henry
cut
his
lip
awful
the
doctor
had
to
put
four
stitches
in
sarah
came
over
and
stood
mountainously
by
the
table
what
the
matter
with
them
beans
she
challenged
nothing
only
saxon
caught
her
breath
and
avoided
the
threatened
outburst
only
i
not
hungry
it
been
so
hot
all
day
it
was
terrible
in
the
recklessly
she
took
a
mouthful
of
the
cold
tea
that
had
been
steeped
so
long
that
it
was
like
acid
in
her
mouth
and
recklessly
under
the
eye
of
her
she
swallowed
it
and
the
rest
of
the
cupful
she
wiped
her
mouth
on
her
handkerchief
and
got
up
i
guess
i
go
to
wonder
you
ai
out
to
a
dance
sarah
sniffed
funny
ai
it
you
come
home
so
dead
tired
every
night
an
yet
any
night
in
the
week
you
can
get
out
an
dance
unearthly
saxon
started
to
speak
suppressed
herself
with
tightened
lips
then
lost
control
and
blazed
out
was
you
ever
young
without
waiting
for
reply
she
turned
to
her
bedroom
which
opened
directly
off
the
kitchen
it
was
a
small
room
eight
by
twelve
and
the
earthquake
had
left
its
marks
upon
the
plaster
a
bed
and
chair
of
cheap
pine
and
a
very
ancient
chest
of
drawers
constituted
the
furniture
saxon
had
known
this
chest
of
drawers
all
her
life
the
vision
of
it
was
woven
into
her
earliest
recollections
she
knew
it
had
crossed
the
plains
with
her
people
in
a
prairie
schooner
it
was
of
solid
mahogany
one
end
was
cracked
and
dented
from
the
capsize
of
the
wagon
in
rock
canyon
a
plugged
in
the
face
of
the
top
drawer
told
of
the
fight
with
the
indians
at
little
meadow
of
these
happenings
her
mother
had
told
her
also
had
she
told
that
the
chest
had
come
with
the
family
originally
from
england
in
a
day
even
earlier
than
the
day
on
which
george
washington
was
born
above
the
chest
of
drawers
on
the
wall
hung
a
small
thrust
under
the
molding
were
photographs
of
young
men
and
women
and
of
picnic
groups
wherein
the
young
men
with
hats
rakishly
on
the
backs
of
their
heads
encircled
the
girls
with
their
arms
farther
along
on
the
wall
were
a
colored
calendar
and
numerous
colored
advertisements
and
sketches
torn
out
of
magazines
most
of
these
sketches
were
of
horses
from
the
hung
a
tangled
bunch
of
dance
programs
saxon
started
to
take
off
her
hat
but
suddenly
sat
down
on
the
bed
she
sobbed
softly
with
considered
repression
but
the
door
swung
noiselessly
open
and
she
was
startled
by
her
voice
now
what
the
matter
with
you
if
you
did
like
them
beans

hurriedly

out

but
seething
with
the
tirade
yet
to
come

shut
the
door
saxon
pleaded
the
door
slammed
violently
and
saxon
ere
she
fell
to
crying
again
could
hear
her
lumbering
about
the
kitchen
and
talking
loudly
to
herself
chapter
ii
each
bought
her
own
ticket
at
the
entrance
to
weasel
park
and
each
as
she
laid
her
down
was
distinctly
aware
of
how
many
pieces
of
fancy
starch
were
represented
by
the
coin
it
was
too
early
for
the
crowd
but
bricklayers
and
their
families
laden
with
huge
and
armfuls
of
babies
were
already
going
in
a
healthy
husky
race
of
workmen
and
robustly
fed
and
with
them
here
and
there
undisguised
by
their
decent
american
clothing
smaller
in
bulk
and
stature
weazened
not
alone
by
age
but
by
the
pinch
of
lean
years
and
early
hardship
were
grandfathers
and
mothers
who
had
patently
first
seen
the
light
of
day
on
old
irish
soil
their
faces
showed
content
and
pride
as
they
limped
along
with
this
lusty
progeny
of
theirs
that
had
fed
on
better
food
not
with
these
did
mary
and
saxon
belong
they
knew
them
not
had
no
acquaintances
among
them
it
did
not
matter
whether
the
festival
were
irish
german
or
slavonian
whether
the
picnic
was
the
bricklayers
the
brewers
or
the
butchers
they
the
girls
were
of
the
dancing
crowd
that
swelled
by
a
certain
constant
percentage
the
gate
receipts
of
all
the
picnics
they
strolled
about
among
the
booths
where
peanuts
were
grinding
and
popcorn
was
roasting
in
preparation
for
the
day
and
went
on
and
inspected
the
dance
floor
of
the
pavilion
saxon
clinging
to
an
imaginary
partner
essayed
a
few
steps
of
the
mary
clapped
her
hands
my
she
cried
you
just
swell
an
them
stockin
is
saxon
smiled
with
appreciation
pointed
out
her
foot
with
high
cuban
heels
and
slightly
lifted
the
tight
black
skirt
exposing
a
trim
ankle
and
delicate
swell
of
calf
the
white
flesh
gleaming
through
the
thinnest
and
flimsiest
of
black
silk
stockings
she
was
slender
not
tall
yet
the
due
round
lines
of
womanhood
were
hers
on
her
white
shirtwaist
was
a
pleated
jabot
of
cheap
lace
caught
with
a
large
novelty
pin
of
imitation
coral
over
the
shirtwaist
was
a
natty
jacket
and
to
the
elbows
she
wore
gloves
of
imitation
suede
the
one
essentially
natural
touch
about
her
appearance
was
the
few
curls
strangers
to
that
escaped
from
under
the
little
naughty
hat
of
black
velvet
pulled
low
over
the
eyes
mary
dark
eyes
flashed
with
joy
at
the
sight
and
with
a
swift
little
run
she
caught
the
other
girl
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
in
a
embrace
she
released
her
blushing
at
her
own
extravagance
you
look
good
to
me
she
cried
in
extenuation
if
i
was
a
man
i
could
keep
my
hands
off
you
i
eat
you
i
sure
they
went
out
of
the
pavilion
hand
in
hand
and
on
through
the
sunshine
they
strolled
swinging
hands
gaily
reacting
exuberantly
from
the
week
of
deadening
toil
they
hung
over
the
railing
of
the
shivering
at
the
huge
and
lonely
denizen
and
passed
quickly
on
to
ten
minutes
of
laughter
at
the
monkey
cage
crossing
the
grounds
they
looked
down
into
the
little
race
track
on
the
bed
of
a
natural
amphitheater
where
the
early
afternoon
games
were
to
take
place
after
that
they
explored
the
woods
threaded
by
countless
paths
ever
opening
out
in
new
surprises
of
rustic
tables
and
benches
in
leafy
nooks
many
of
which
were
already
by
family
parties
on
a
grassy
slope
they
spread
a
newspaper
and
sat
down
on
the
short
grass
already
under
the
california
sun
half
were
they
minded
to
do
this
because
of
the
grateful
indolence
after
six
days
of
insistent
motion
half
in
conservation
for
the
hours
of
dancing
to
come
bert
wanhope
be
sure
to
come

was
going
to

run
after
him
i
afraid
of
him
he
ai
quick
in
talkin
more
like
that
big
bear
we
saw
bite
your
head
off
just
like
that
he
ai
really
a
he
a
teamster
belongs
to
the
union
drives
for
coberly
and
morrison
but
sometimes
he
fights
in
the
clubs
most
of
the
fellows
are
scared
of
him
he
got
a
bad
temper
an
he
just
as
soon
hit
a
fellow
as
eat
just
like
that
you
wo
like
him
but
he
a
swell
dancer
he
heavy
you
know
an
he
just
slides
and
glides
around
you
wanta
have
a
dance
with
anyway
he
a
good
spender
too
never
pinches
but
my
got
one
the
talk
wandered
on
a
monologue
on
mary
part
that
centered
always
on
bert
wanhope
you
and
he
are
pretty
thick
saxon
ventured
i
marry
mary
flashed
out
impulsively
then
her
face
went
bleakly
forlorn
hard
almost
in
its
helpless
pathos
only
he
never
asks
me
he
her
pause
was
broken
by
sudden
passion
you
watch
out
for
him
saxon
if
he
ever
comes
foolin
around
you
he
no
good
just
the
same
i
marry
him
he
never
get
me
any
other
her
mouth
opened
but
instead
of
speaking
she
drew
a
long
sigh
it
a
funny
world
ai
it
she
added
more
like
a
scream
and
all
the
stars
are
worlds
too
i
wonder
where
god
hides
bert
wanhope
says
there
ai
no
god
but
he
just
terrible
he
says
the
most
terrible
things
i
believe
in
god
do
you
what
do
you
think
about
god
saxon
saxon
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
laughed
but
if
we
do
wrong
we
get
ours
do
we
mary
persisted
that
what
they
all
say
except
bert
he
says
he
do
care
what
he
does
never
get
his
because
when
he
dies
he
dead
an
when
he
dead
like
to
see
any
one
put
anything
across
on
him
that
wake
him
up
he
terrible
though
but
it
all
so
funny
sometimes
i
get
scared
when
i
think
god
keepin
an
eye
on
me
all
the
time
do
you
think
he
knows
what
i
sayin
now
what
do
you
think
he
looks
like
anyway
i
do
know
saxon
answered
he
just
a
funny
oh
the
other
gasped
he
is
just
the
same
from
what
all
people
say
of
him
saxon
went
on
stoutly
my
brother
thinks
he
looks
like
abraham
lincoln
sarah
thinks
he
has
an
i
never
think
of
him
with
his
hair
parted
mary
confessed
daring
the
thought
and
shivering
with
apprehension
he
just
could
have
his
hair
parted
that
be
you
know
that
little
wrinkly
mexican
that
sells
wire
puzzles
saxon
queried
well
god
somehow
always
reminds
me
of
mary
laughed
outright
now
that
is
funny
i
never
thought
of
him
like
that
how
do
you
make
it
out
well
just
like
the
little
mexican
he
seems
to
spend
his
time
peddling
puzzles
he
passes
a
puzzle
out
to
everybody
and
they
spend
all
their
lives
tryin
to
work
it
out
they
all
get
stuck
i
ca
work
mine
out
i
do
know
where
to
start
and
look
at
the
puzzle
he
passed
sarah
and
she
part
of
tom
puzzle
and
she
only
makes
his
worse
and
they
all
an
everybody
i
know
you
too
are
part
of
my
mebbe
the
puzzles
is
all
right
mary
considered
but
god
do
look
like
that
yellow
little
greaser
that
i
wo
fall
for
god
do
look
like
anybody
do
you
remember
on
the
wall
at
the
salvation
army
it
says
is
a
spirit
that
another
one
of
his
puzzles
i
guess
because
nobody
knows
what
a
spirit
looks
that
right
mary
shuddered
with
reminiscent
fear
whenever
i
try
to
think
of
god
as
a
spirit
i
can
see
hen
miller
all
wrapped
up
in
a
sheet
an
runnin
us
girls
we
did
know
an
it
scared
the
life
out
of
us
little
maggie
murphy
fainted
dead
away
and
beatrice
peralta
fell
an
scratched
her
face
horrible
when
i
think
of
a
spirit
all
i
can
see
is
a
white
sheet
runnin
in
the
dark
just
the
same
god
do
look
like
a
mexican
an
he
do
wear
his
hair
a
strain
of
music
from
the
dancing
pavilion
brought
both
girls
scrambling
to
their
feet
we
can
get
a
couple
of
dances
in
before
we
eat
mary
proposed
then
it
be
afternoon
an
all
the
fellows
be
here
most
of
them
are
pinchers
that
why
they
do
come
early
so
as
to
get
out
of
taking
the
girls
to
dinner
but
bert
free
with
his
money
an
so
is
billy
if
we
can
beat
the
other
girls
to
it
they
take
us
to
the
restaurant
come
on
hurry
there
were
few
couples
on
the
floor
when
they
arrived
at
the
pavilion
and
the
two
girls
essayed
the
first
waltz
together
there
bert
now
saxon
whispered
as
they
came
around
the
second
time
do
take
any
notice
of
them
mary
whispered
back
we
just
keep
on
goin
they
need
think
we
chasin
after
but
saxon
noted
the
heightened
color
in
the
other
cheek
and
felt
her
quicker
breathing
did
you
see
that
other
one
mary
asked
as
she
backed
saxon
in
a
long
slide
across
the
far
end
of
the
pavilion
that
was
billy
roberts
bert
said
he
come
he
take
you
to
dinner
and
bert
take
me
goin
to
be
a
swell
day
you
see
my
i
only
wish
the
music
hold
out
till
we
can
get
back
to
the
other
down
the
floor
they
danced
on
and
intent
two
fresh
young
things
that
undeniably
danced
well
and
that
were
delightfully
surprised
when
the
music
stranded
them
perilously
near
to
their
desire
bert
and
mary
addressed
each
other
by
their
given
names
but
to
saxon
bert
was
mr
wanhope
though
he
called
her
by
her
first
name
the
only
introduction
was
of
saxon
and
billy
roberts
mary
carried
it
off
with
a
flurry
of
nervous
carelessness
mr
robert
miss
brown
she
my
best
friend
her
first
name
saxon
ai
it
a
scream
of
a
name
sounds
good
to
me
billy
retorted
hat
off
and
hand
extended
pleased
to
meet
you
miss
as
their
hands
clasped
and
she
felt
the
teamster
callouses
on
his
palm
her
quick
eyes
saw
a
score
of
things
about
all
that
he
saw
was
her
eyes
and
then
it
was
with
a
vague
impression
that
they
were
blue
not
till
later
in
the
day
did
he
realize
that
they
were
gray
she
on
the
contrary
saw
his
eyes
as
they
really
were
deep
blue
wide
and
handsome
in
a
way
she
saw
that
they
were
and
she
liked
them
as
she
had
liked
the
glimpse
she
had
caught
of
his
hand
and
as
she
liked
the
contact
of
his
hand
itself
then
too
but
not
sharply
she
had
perceived
the
short
nose
the
rosiness
of
cheek
and
the
firm
short
upper
lip
ere
delight
centered
her
flash
of
gaze
on
the
large
clean
mouth
where
red
lips
smiled
clear
of
the
white
enviable
teeth
a
boy
a
great
big
was
her
thought
and
as
they
smiled
at
each
other
and
their
hands
slipped
apart
she
was
startled
by
a
glimpse
of
his
hair
short
and
crisp
and
sandy
hinting
almost
of
palest
gold
save
that
it
was
too
flaxen
to
hint
of
gold
at
all
so
blond
was
he
that
she
was
reminded
of
she
had
seen
such
as
ole
olson
and
yon
yonson
but
there
resemblance
ceased
it
was
a
matter
of
color
only
for
the
eyes
were
and
and
were
cloudy
with
temperament
rather
than
staring
a
of
wonder
and
the
suit
of
smooth
brown
cloth
had
been
made
by
a
tailor
saxon
appraised
the
suit
on
the
instant
and
her
secret
judgment
was
not
a
cent
less
than
fifty
dollars
further
he
had
none
of
the
awkwardness
of
the
scandinavian
immigrant
on
the
contrary
he
was
one
of
those
rare
individuals
that
radiate
muscular
grace
through
the
ungraceful
of
civilization
every
movement
was
supple
slow
and
apparently
considered
this
she
did
not
see
nor
analyze
she
saw
only
a
clothed
man
with
grace
of
carriage
and
movement
she
felt
rather
than
perceived
the
calm
and
certitude
of
all
the
muscular
play
of
him
and
she
felt
too
the
promise
of
easement
and
rest
that
was
especially
grateful
and
by
one
who
had
incessantly
for
six
days
and
at
ironed
fancy
starch
as
the
touch
of
his
hand
had
been
good
so
to
her
this
subtler
feel
of
all
of
him
body
and
mind
was
good
as
he
took
her
program
and
skirmished
and
joked
after
the
way
of
young
men
she
realized
the
immediacy
of
delight
she
had
taken
in
him
never
in
her
life
had
she
been
so
affected
by
any
man
she
wondered
to
herself
is
this
the
man
he
danced
beautifully
the
joy
was
hers
that
good
dancers
take
when
they
have
found
a
good
dancer
for
a
partner
the
grace
of
those
certain
muscles
of
his
accorded
perfectly
with
the
rhythm
of
the
music
there
was
never
doubt
never
a
betrayal
of
indecision
she
glanced
at
bert
dancing
tough
with
mary
caroming
down
the
long
floor
with
more
than
one
collision
with
the
increasing
couples
graceful
himself
in
his
slender
tall
way
bert
was
accounted
a
good
dancer
yet
saxon
did
not
remember
ever
having
danced
with
him
with
keen
pleasure
just
a
hit
of
a
jerk
spoiled
his
dancing
a
jerk
that
did
not
occur
usually
but
that
always
impended
there
was
something
spasmodic
in
his
mind
he
was
too
quick
or
he
continually
threatened
to
be
too
quick
he
always
seemed
just
on
the
verge
of
overrunning
the
time
it
was
disquieting
he
made
for
unrest
you
a
dream
of
a
dancer
billy
roberts
was
saying
i
heard
lots
of
the
fellows
talk
about
your
i
love
it
she
answered
but
from
the
way
she
said
it
he
sensed
her
reluctance
to
speak
and
danced
on
in
silence
while
she
warmed
with
the
appreciation
of
a
woman
for
gentle
consideration
gentle
consideration
was
a
thing
rarely
encountered
in
the
life
she
lived
is
this
the
man
she
remembered
mary
i
marry
him
and
caught
herself
speculating
on
marrying
billy
roberts
by
the
next
day
if
he
asked
her
with
eyes
that
dreamily
desired
to
close
she
moved
on
in
the
arms
of
this
masterful
guiding
pressure
a
she
experienced
a
thrill
of
wickedness
as
she
thought
of
what
sarah
would
say
could
she
see
her
now
only
he
was
a
prizefighter
but
a
teamster
came
an
abrupt
lengthening
of
step
the
guiding
pressure
grew
more
compelling
and
she
was
caught
up
and
carried
along
though
her
feet
never
left
the
floor
then
came
the
sudden
control
down
to
the
shorter
step
again
and
she
felt
herself
being
held
slightly
from
him
so
that
he
might
look
into
her
face
and
laugh
with
her
in
joy
at
the
exploit
at
the
end
as
the
band
slowed
in
the
last
bars
they
too
slowed
their
dance
fading
with
the
music
in
a
lengthening
glide
that
ceased
with
the
last
lingering
tone
we
sure
cut
out
for
each
other
when
it
comes
to
dancin
he
said
as
they
made
their
way
to
rejoin
the
other
couple
it
was
a
dream
she
replied
so
low
was
her
voice
that
he
bent
to
hear
and
saw
the
flush
in
her
cheeks
that
seemed
communicated
to
her
eyes
which
were
softly
warm
and
sensuous
he
took
the
program
from
her
and
gravely
and
gigantically
wrote
his
name
across
all
the
length
of
it
an
now
it
no
good
he
dared
ai
no
need
for
he
tore
it
across
and
tossed
it
aside
me
for
you
saxon
for
the
next
was
bert
greeting
as
they
came
up
you
take
mary
for
the
next
whirl
nothin
doin
bo
was
the
retort
me
an
saxon
framed
up
to
last
the
watch
out
for
him
saxon
mary
warned
facetiously
he
liable
to
get
a
crush
on
i
guess
i
know
a
good
thing
when
i
see
it
billy
responded
gallantly
and
so
do
i
saxon
aided
and
abetted
i
known
you
if
i
seen
you
in
the
dark
billy
added
mary
regarded
them
with
mock
alarm
and
bert
said
all
i
got
to
say
is
you
ai
wastin
any
time
gettin
together
just
the
same
if
you
can
spare
a
few
minutes
from
each
other
after
a
couple
more
whirls
mary
an
me
be
complimented
to
have
your
presence
at
just
like
that
chimed
mary
quit
your
kiddin
billy
laughed
back
turning
his
head
to
look
into
saxon
eyes
do
listen
to
they
grouched
because
they
got
to
dance
together
bert
a
rotten
dancer
and
mary
ai
so
much
come
on
there
she
goes
see
you
after
two
more
chapter
iii
they
had
dinner
in
the
and
saxon
noted
that
it
was
billy
who
paid
the
reckoning
for
the
four
they
knew
many
of
the
young
men
and
women
at
the
other
tables
and
greetings
and
fun
flew
back
and
forth
bert
was
very
possessive
with
mary
almost
roughly
so
resting
his
hand
on
hers
catching
and
holding
it
and
once
forcibly
slipping
off
her
two
rings
and
refusing
to
return
them
for
a
long
while
at
times
when
he
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
mary
promptly
disengaged
it
and
at
other
times
with
elaborate
obliviousness
that
deceived
no
one
she
allowed
it
to
remain
and
saxon
talking
little
but
studying
billy
roberts
very
intently
was
satisfied
that
there
would
be
an
utter
difference
in
the
way
he
would
do
such
things
if
ever
he
would
do
them
anyway
he
never
paw
a
girl
as
bert
and
lots
of
the
other
fellows
did
she
measured
the
breadth
of
billy
heavy
shoulders
why
do
they
call
you
bill
she
asked
you
not
so
very
nope
he
agreed
i
only
five
feet
eight
an
i
guess
it
must
be
my
he
fights
at
a
hundred
an
eighty
bert
interjected
oh
cut
it
billy
said
quickly
a
of
displeasure
showing
in
his
eyes
i
ai
a
fighter
i
ai
fought
in
six
months
i
quit
it
it
do
yon
got
two
hundred
the
night
you
put
the
frisco
slasher
to
the
bad
bert
urged
proudly
cut
it
cut
it
say
saxon
you
ai
so
big
yourself
are
you
but
you
built
just
right
if
anybody
should
ask
you
you
round
slender
at
the
same
time
i
bet
i
can
guess
your
everybody
guesses
over
it
she
warned
while
inwardly
she
was
puzzled
that
she
should
at
the
same
time
be
glad
and
regretful
that
he
did
not
fight
any
more
not
me
he
was
saying
i
a
wooz
at
just
you
watch
he
regarded
her
critically
and
it
was
patent
that
warm
approval
played
its
little
rivalry
with
the
judgment
of
his
gaze
wait
a
he
reached
over
to
her
and
felt
her
arm
at
the
biceps
the
pressure
of
the
encircling
fingers
was
firm
and
honest
and
saxon
thrilled
to
it
there
was
magic
in
this
she
would
have
known
only
irritation
had
bert
or
any
other
man
felt
her
arm
but
this
man
is
he
the
man
she
was
questioning
when
he
voiced
his
conclusion
your
clothes
do
weigh
seven
pounds
and
seven
from
hum
say
one
hundred
an
one
hundred
an
sixteen
is
your
stripped
but
at
the
penultimate
word
mary
cried
out
with
sharp
reproof
why
billy
roberts
people
do
talk
about
such
he
looked
at
her
with
uncomprehending
surprise
what
things
he
demanded
finally
there
you
go
again
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
look
got
saxon
blushing
i
am
not
saxon
denied
indignantly
an
if
you
keep
on
mary
you
have
me
blushing
billy
growled
i
guess
i
know
what
right
an
what
ai
it
ai
what
a
guy
says
but
what
he
thinks
an
i
thinkin
right
an
saxon
knows
it
an
she
i
ai
thinkin
what
you
thinkin
at
oh
oh
mary
cried
you
gettin
worse
an
worse
i
never
think
such
whoa
mary
back
up
bert
checked
her
peremptorily
you
in
the
wrong
stall
billy
never
makes
mistakes
like
but
he
need
be
so
raw
she
persisted
come
on
mary
an
be
good
an
cut
that
stuff
was
billy
dismissal
of
her
as
he
turned
to
saxon
how
near
did
i
come
to
it
one
hundred
and
she
answered
looking
deliberately
at
mary
one
twenty
two
with
my
billy
burst
into
hearty
laughter
in
which
bert
joined
i
do
care
mary
protested
you
terrible
both
of
you
an
you
too
saxon
i
never
it
of
listen
to
me
kid
bert
began
soothingly
as
his
arm
slipped
around
her
waist
but
in
the
false
excitement
she
had
worked
herself
into
mary
rudely
repulsed
the
arm
and
then
fearing
that
she
had
wounded
her
feelings
she
took
advantage
of
the
teasing
and
banter
to
recover
her
good
humor
his
arm
was
permitted
to
return
and
with
heads
bent
together
they
talked
in
whispers
billy
discreetly
began
to
make
conversation
with
saxon
say
you
know
your
name
is
a
funny
one
i
never
heard
it
tagged
on
anybody
before
but
it
all
right
i
like
my
mother
gave
it
to
me
she
was
educated
and
knew
all
kinds
of
words
she
was
always
reading
books
almost
until
she
died
and
she
wrote
lots
and
lots
i
got
some
of
her
poetry
published
in
a
san
jose
newspaper
long
ago
the
saxons
were
a
race
of
people
she
told
me
all
about
them
when
i
was
a
little
girl
they
were
wild
like
indians
only
they
were
white
and
they
had
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
and
they
were
awful
as
she
talked
billy
followed
her
solemnly
his
eyes
steadily
turned
on
hers
never
heard
of
them
he
confessed
did
they
live
anywhere
around
here
she
laughed
no
they
lived
in
england
they
were
the
first
english
and
you
know
the
americans
came
from
the
english
we
saxons
you
an
me
an
mary
an
bert
and
all
the
americans
that
are
real
americans
you
know
and
not
dagoes
and
japs
and
my
folks
lived
in
america
a
long
time
billy
said
slowly
digesting
the
information
she
had
given
and
relating
himself
to
it
anyway
my
mother
folks
did
they
crossed
to
maine
hundreds
of
years
my
father
was
of
maine
she
broke
in
with
a
little
gurgle
of
joy
and
my
mother
was
born
in
ohio
or
where
ohio
is
now
she
used
to
call
it
the
great
western
reserve
what
was
your
father
do
billy
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
did
know
himself
nobody
ever
knew
though
he
was
american
all
right
all
his
name
regular
old
american
saxon
suggested
there
a
big
english
general
right
now
whose
name
is
roberts
i
read
it
in
the
but
roberts
was
my
father
name
he
never
knew
what
his
name
was
roberts
was
the
name
of
a
who
adopted
him
you
see
it
was
this
way
when
they
was
up
there
with
the
modoc
indians
a
lot
of
the
miners
an
settlers
took
a
hand
roberts
was
captain
of
one
outfit
and
once
after
a
fight
they
took
a
lot
of
prisoners
squaws
an
kids
an
babies
an
one
of
the
kids
was
my
father
they
figured
he
was
about
five
years
old
he
did
know
nothin
but
saxon
clapped
her
hands
and
her
eyes
sparkled
he
been
captured
on
an
indian
raid
that
the
way
they
figured
it
billy
nodded
they
recollected
a
of
oregon
settlers
that
been
killed
by
the
modocs
four
years
before
roberts
adopted
him
and
that
why
i
do
know
his
real
name
but
you
can
bank
on
it
he
crossed
the
plains
just
the
so
did
my
father
saxon
said
proudly
an
my
mother
too
billy
added
pride
touching
his
own
voice
anyway
she
came
pretty
close
to
crossin
the
plains
because
she
was
born
in
a
wagon
on
the
river
platte
on
the
way
my
mother
too
said
saxon
she
was
eight
years
old
an
she
walked
most
of
the
way
after
the
oxen
began
to
give
billy
thrust
out
his
hand
put
her
there
kid
he
said
we
just
like
old
friends
what

the
same
kind
of
folks
behind

extended
her
hand
to
his
and
gravely
they

mary
put
her
hand
over
his
mouth
and
began
to
chide
him
for
his
awfulness
whereupon
he
kissed
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
put
his
head
closer
to
hers
the
merry
clatter
of
dishes
was
increasing
as
the
filled
up
here
and
there
voices
were
raised
in
snatches
of
song
there
were
shrill
squeals
and
screams
and
bursts
of
heavier
male
laughter
as
the
everlasting
skirmishing
between
the
young
men
and
girls
played
on
among
some
of
the
men
the
signs
of
drink
were
already
manifest
at
a
near
table
girls
were
calling
out
to
billy
and
saxon
the
sense
of
temporary
possession
already
strong
on
her

with
jealous
eyes
that
he
was
a
favorite
and
desired

called

gallantly
saxon

herself
that
he
showed
vexation
and
she
conceived
an
immense
dislike
for
the
brunette
goin
to
dance

latter
called

he
answered
and
turned
abruptly
to
saxon

old
americans

think
they
ai
many
of
us

country

of
he
talked
on
steadily
in
a
low
confidential
voice
head
close
to
hers
as
advertisement
to
the
other
girl
that
he
was
occupied
from
the
next
table
on
the
opposite
side
a
young
man
had
singled
out
saxon
his
dress
was
tough
his
companions
male
and
female
were
tough
his
face
was
inflamed
his
eyes
touched
with
wildness
hey

he
called
you
with
the
velvet
slippers
me
for
the
girl
beside
him
put
her
arm
around
his
neck
and
tried
to
hush
him
and
through
the
mufflement
of
her
embrace
they
could
hear
him
gurgling
i
tell
you
she
some
goods

across
an
win

from
them
cheap
butchertown
hoodlums
mary
sniffed
saxon
eyes
encountered
the
eyes
of
the
girl
who
glared
hatred
across
at
her
and
in
billy
eyes
she
saw
moody
anger
smouldering
the
eyes
were
more
sullen
more
handsome
than
ever
and
clouds
and
veils
and
lights
and
shadows
shifted
and
deepened
in
the
blue
of
them
until
they
gave
her
a
sense
of
unfathomable
depth
he
had
stopped
talking
and
he
made
no
effort
to
talk
do
start
a
rough
house
bill
bert
cautioned
they
from
across
the
bay
an
they
do
know
you
that
bert
stood
up
suddenly
stepped
over
to
the
other
table
whispered
briefly
and
came
back
every
face
at
the
table
was
turned
on
billy
the
offender
arose
brokenly
shook
off
the
detaining
hand
of
his
girl
and
came
over
he
was
a
large
man
with
a
hard
malignant
face
and
bitter
eyes
also
he
was
a
subdued
man
you
big
bill
roberts
he
said
thickly
clinging
to
the
table
as
he
reeled

hat

you
shake
hands
gruffly
billy
said
it
all
right
forget
it
sport
and
sullenly
he
shook
hands
and
with
a
slow
massive
movement
thrust
the
other
back
toward
his
own
table
saxon
was
glowing
here
was
a
man
a
protector
something
to
lean
against
of
whom
even
the
butchertown
toughs
were
afraid
as
soon
as
his
name
was
mentioned
chapter
iv
after
dinner
there
were
two
dances
in
the
pavilion
and
then
the
band
led
the
way
to
the
race
track
for
the
games
the
dancers
followed
and
all
through
the
grounds
the
picnic
parties
left
their
tables
to
join
in
five
thousand
packed
the
grassy
slopes
of
the
amphitheater
and
swarmed
inside
the
race
track
here
first
of
the
events
the
men
were
lining
up
for
a
tug
of
war
the
contest
was
between
the
oakland
bricklayers
and
the
san
francisco
bricklayers
and
the
picked
braves
huge
and
heavy
were
taking
their
positions
along
the
rope
they
kicked
in
the
soft
earth
rubbed
their
hands
with
the
soil
from
underfoot
and
laughed
and
joked
with
the
crowd
that
surged
about
them
the
judges
and
watchers
struggled
vainly
to
keep
back
this
crowd
of
relatives
and
friends
the
celtic
blood
was
up
and
the
celtic
faction
spirit
ran
high
the
air
was
filled
with
cries
of
cheer
advice
warning
and
threat
many
elected
to
leave
the
side
of
their
own
team
and
go
to
the
side
of
the
other
team
with
the
intention
of
circumventing
foul
play
there
were
as
many
women
as
men
among
the
jostling
supporters
the
dust
from
the
trampling
scuffling
feet
rose
in
the
air
and
mary
gasped
and
coughed
and
begged
bert
to
take
her
away
but
he
the
imp
in
him
elated
with
the
prospect
of
trouble
insisted
on
urging
in
closer
saxon
clung
to
billy
who
slowly
and
methodically
elbowed
and
shouldered
a
way
for
her
no
place
for
a
girl
he
grumbled
looking
down
at
her
with
a
masked
expression
of
while
his
elbow
powerfully
crushed
on
the
ribs
of
a
big
irishman
who
gave
room
things
break
loose
when
they
start
pullin
they
been
too
much
drink
an
you
know
what
the
micks
are
for
a
rough
saxon
was
very
much
out
of
place
among
these
men
and
women
she
seemed
very
small
and
childlike
delicate
and
fragile
a
creature
from
another
race
only
billy
skilled
bulk
and
muscle
saved
her
he
was
continually
glancing
from
face
to
face
of
the
women
and
always
returning
to
study
her
face
nor
was
she
unaware
of
the
contrast
he
was
making
some
excitement
occurred
a
score
of
feet
away
from
them
and
to
the
sound
of
exclamations
and
blows
a
surge
ran
through
the
crowd
a
large
man
wedged
sidewise
in
the
jam
was
shoved
against
saxon
crushing
her
closely
against
billy
who
reached
across
to
the
man
shoulder
with
a
massive
thrust
that
was
not
so
slow
as
usual
an
involuntary
grunt
came
from
the
victim
who
turned
his
head
showing
blond
skin
and
unmistakable
angry
irish
eyes
what
eatin
yeh
he
snarled
get
off
your
foot
you
standin
on
it
was
billy
contemptuous
reply
emphasized
by
an
increase
of
thrust
the
irishman
grunted
again
and
made
a
frantic
struggle
to
twist
his
body
around
but
the
wedging
bodies
on
either
side
held
him
in
a
vise
i
break
yer
ugly
face
for
yeh
in
a
minute
he
announced
in
tones
then
his
own
face
underwent
transformation
the
snarl
left
the
lips
and
the
angry
eyes
grew
genial
an
sure
an
it
yerself
he
said
i
did
know
it
was
yeh
i
seen
yeh
lick
the
terrible
swede
if
yeh
was
robbed
on
the
no
you
did
bo
billy
answered
pleasantly
you
saw
me
take
a
good
beatin
that
night
the
decision
was
all
the
irishman
was
now
beaming
he
had
endeavored
to
pay
a
compliment
with
a
lie
and
the
prompt
repudiation
of
the
lie
served
only
to
increase
his
sure
an
a
bad
beatin
it
was
he
acknowledged
but
yeh
showed
the
grit
of
a
bunch
of
wildcats
soon
as
i
can
get
me
arm
free
i
goin
to
shake
yeh
by
the
hand
an
help
yeh
aise
yer
young
frustrated
in
the
struggle
to
get
the
crowd
back
the
referee
fired
his
revolver
in
the
air
and
the
was
on
pandemonium
broke
loose
saxon
protected
by
the
two
big
men
was
near
enough
to
the
front
to
see
much
that
ensued
the
men
on
the
rope
pulled
and
strained
till
their
faces
were
red
with
effort
and
their
joints
crackled
the
rope
was
new
and
as
their
hands
slipped
their
wives
and
daughters
sprang
in
scooping
up
the
earth
in
double
handfuls
and
pouring
it
on
the
rope
and
the
hands
of
their
men
to
give
them
better
grip
a
stout
woman
carried
beyond
herself
by
the
passion
of
the
contest
seized
the
rope
and
pulled
beside
her
husband
encouraged
him
with
loud
cries
a
watcher
from
the
opposing
team
dragged
her
screaming
away
and
was
dropped
like
a
steer
by
an
from
a
partisan
from
the
woman
team
he
in
turn
went
down
and
brawny
women
joined
with
their
men
in
the
battle
vainly
the
judges
and
watchers
begged
pleaded
yelled
and
swung
with
their
fists
men
as
well
as
women
were
springing
in
to
the
rope
and
pulling
no
longer
was
it
team
against
team
but
all
oakland
against
all
san
francisco
festooned
with
a
fight
hands
overlaid
hands
two
and
three
deep
in
the
struggle
to
grasp
the
rope
and
hands
that
found
no
holds
doubled
into
bunches
of
knuckles
that
impacted
on
the
jaws
of
the
watchers
who
strove
to
tear
from
the
rope
bert
yelped
with
joy
while
mary
clung
to
him
mad
with
fear
close
to
the
rope
the
fighters
were
going
down
and
being
trampled
the
dust
arose
in
clouds
while
from
beyond
all
around
unable
to
get
into
the
battle
could
be
heard
the
shrill
and
impotent
and
of
women
and
men
dirty
work
dirty
work
billy
muttered
over
and
over
and
though
he
saw
much
that
occurred
assisted
by
the
friendly
irishman
he
was
coolly
and
safely
working
saxon
back
out
of
the
melee
at
last
the
break
came
the
losing
team
accompanied
by
its
host
of
volunteers
was
dragged
in
a
rush
over
the
ground
and
disappeared
under
the
avalanche
of
battling
forms
of
the
onlookers
leaving
saxon
under
the
protection
of
the
irishman
in
an
outer
eddy
of
calm

amazingly
short
time
for
from
the
stand
beside
the
track
the
announcer
was
bellowing
the
start
of
the
boys
and
bert
disappointed

through
a
bedlam
of
cheering
supporters

and
good
nature
reigned
again
five
young
men

at
the
start
redhead
led
with
a
young
man
at
his
shoulder
and
it
was
plain
that
the

between
these

around

the
lead
in
a
spurt
that

intended
to

gloated
ai
frisco

bein
challenged
the
judges

oh

why

billy
saxon
asked
he
the
frisco
bunch
is
challengin

for
a
professional
billy
elucidated
that
what
they
all
beefin
about
but
it
ai
right
they
all
ran
for
that
money
so
they
all
the
crowd
surged
and
argued
and
roared
in
front
of
the
judges
stand
the
stand
was
a
rickety
affair
the
second
story
open
at
the
front
and
here
the
judges
could
be
seen
debating
as
heatedly
as
the
crowd
beneath
them
there
she
starts
bert
cried
oh
you
the
racer
backed
by
a
dozen
supporters
was
climbing
the
outside
stairs
to
the
judges
the
his
friend
billy
said

paid
him
some
of
the
judges

some

beefin
an
now
that
other

he
turned
to
saxon
with
a
reassuring
smile
we
well
out
of
it
this
time
there
goin
to
be
rough
stuff
down
there
in
a
the
judges
are
tryin
to
make
him
give
the
money
back
bert
explained
an
if
he
do
the
other
gang
take
it
away
from
him
see
reachin
for
it
high
above
his
head
the
winner
held
the
roll
of
paper
containing
the
silver
dollars
his
gang
around
him
was
shouldering
back
those
who
tried
to
seize
the
money
no
blows
had
been
struck
yet
but
the
struggle
increased
until
the
frail
structure
shook
and
swayed
from
the
crowd
beneath
the
winner
was
variously
addressed
give
it
back
you
dog
hang
on
to
it
tim
you
won
fair
timmy
give
it
back
you
dirty
robber
abuse
unprintable
as
well
as
friendly
advice
was
hurled
at
him
the
struggle
grew
more
violent
tim
supporters
strove
to
hold
him
off
the
floor
so
that
his
hand
would
still
be
above
the
grasping
hands
that
shot
up
once
for
an
instant
his
arm
was
jerked
down
again
it
went
up
but
evidently
the
paper
had
broken
and
with
a
last
desperate
effort
before
he
went
down
tim
flung
the
coin
out
in
a
silvery
shower
upon
the
heads
of
the
crowd
beneath
then
ensued
a
weary
period
of
arguing
and
quarreling
i
wish
they
finish
so
as
we
could
get
back
to
the
dancin
mary
complained
this
ai
no
slowly
and
painfully
the
judges
stand
was
cleared
and
an
announcer
stepping
to
the
front
of
the
stand
spread
his
arms
appealing
for
silence
the
angry
clamor
died
down
the
judges
have
decided
he
shouted
that
this
day
of
good
fellowship
an
brotherhood
hear
hear
many
of
the
cooler
heads
applauded
that
the
stuff
no
fightin
no
hard
feelin
an
therefore
the
announcer
became
audible
again
the
judges
have
decided
to
put
up
another
purse
of
dollars
an
run
the
race
over
again
an
tim
bellowed
scores
of
throats
what
about
tim
he
been
robbed
the
judges
is
rotten
again
the
announcer
stilled
the
tumult
with
his
arm
appeal
the
judges
have
decided
for
the
sake
of
good
feelin
that
timothy
mcmanus
will
also
run
if
he
wins
the
money
now
would
that
jar
you
billy
grumbled
disgustedly
if
eligible
now
he
was
eligible
the
first
time
an
if
he
was
eligible
the
first
time
then
the
money
was
bust
himself
wide
open
this
time
bert
jubilated
an
so
will
tim
billy
rejoined
you
can
bet
he
mad
clean
through
and
he
let
out
the
links
he
was
holdin
in
last
another
quarter
of
an
hour
was
spent
in
clearing
the
track
of
the
excited
crowd
and
this
time
only
tim
and
toed
the
mark
the
other
three
young
men
had
abandoned
the
contest
the
leap
of
tim
at
the
report
of
the
revolver
put
him
a
clean
yard
in
the
lead
i
guess
he
professional
all
right
all
right
billy
remarked
just
look
at
him
go
around
tim
led
by
fifty
feet
and
running
swiftly
maintaining
the
same
lead
he
came
down
the
homestretch
an
easy
winner
when
directly
beneath
the
group
on
the
hillside
the
incredible
and
unthinkable
happened
standing
close
to
the
inside
edge
of
the
track
was
a
dapper
young
man
with
a
light
switch
cane
he
was
distinctly
out
of
place
in
such
a
gathering
for
upon
him
was
no
of
the
working
class
afterward
bert
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
looked
like
a
swell
dancing
master
while
billy
called
him
the
so
far
as
timothy
mcmanus
was
concerned
the
dapper
young
man
was
destiny
for
as
tim
passed
him
the
young
man
with
utmost
deliberation
thrust
his
cane
between
tim
flying
legs
tim
sailed
through
the
air
in
a
headlong
pitch
struck
on
his
face
and
plowed
along
in
a
cloud
of
dust
there
was
an
instant
of
vast
and
gasping
silence
the
young
man
too
seemed
petrified
by
the
ghastliness
of
his
deed
it
took
an
appreciable
interval
of
time
for
him
as
well
as
for
the
onlookers
to
realize
what
he
had
done
they
recovered
first
and
from
a
thousand
throats
the
wild
irish
yell
went
up
won
the
race
without
a
cheer
the
storm
center
had
shifted
to
the
young
man
with
the
cane
after
the
yell
he
had
one
moment
of
indecision
then
he
turned
and
darted
up
the
track
go
it
sport
bert
cheered
waving
his
hat
in
the
air
you
the
goods
for
me
who
it
who
it
say
would
it
now
just
would
it
phew
he
a
streak
himself
billy
admired
but
what
did
he
do
it
for
he
no
like
a
frightened
rabbit
the
mad
roar
at
his
heels
the
young
man
tore
up
the
track
to
an
open
space
on
the
hillside
up
which
he
clawed
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
behind
him
toiled
a
hundred
vengeful
runners
it
too
bad
he
missing
the
rest
of
it
billy
said
look
at
goin
to
bert
was
beside
himself
he
leaped
up
and
down
and
cried
continuously
look
at
look
at
look
at
the
oakland
faction
was
outraged
twice
had
its
favorite
runner
been
jobbed
out
of
the
race
this
last
was
only
another
vile
trick
of
the
frisco
faction
so
oakland
doubled
its
brawny
fists
and
swung
into
san
francisco
for
blood
and
san
francisco
consciously
innocent
was
no
less
willing
to
join
issues
to
be
charged
with
such
a
crime
was
no
less
monstrous
than
the
crime
itself
besides
for
too
many
tedious
hours
had
the
irish
heroically
suppressed
themselves
five
thousands
of
them
exploded
into
joyous
battle
the
women
joined
with
them
the
whole
amphitheater
was
filled
with
the
conflict
there
were
rallies
retreats
charges
and
weaker
groups
were
forced
fighting
up
the
hillsides
other
groups
bested
fled
among
the
trees
to
carry
on
guerrilla
warfare
emerging
in
sudden
dashes
to
overwhelm
isolated
enemies
half
a
dozen
special
policemen
hired
by
the
weasel
park
management
received
an
impartial
trouncing
from
both
sides
nobody
the
friend
of
a
policeman
bert
chortled
dabbing
his
handkerchief
to
his
injured
ear
which
still
bled
the
bushes
crackled
behind
him
and
he
sprang
aside
to
let
the
locked
forms
of
two
men
go
by
rolling
over
and
over
down
the
hill
each
striking
when
uppermost
and
followed
by
a
screaming
woman
who
rained
blows
on
the
one
who
was
patently
not
of
her
clan
the
judges
in
the
second
story
of
the
stand
valiantly
withstood
a
fierce
assault
until
the
frail
structure
toppled
to
the
ground
in
splinters
what
that
woman
doing
saxon
asked
calling
attention
to
an
elderly
woman
beneath
them
on
the
track
who
had
sat
down
and
was
pulling
from
her
foot
an
shoe
of
generous
dimensions
goin
swimming
bert
chuckled
as
the
stocking
followed
they
watched
fascinated
the
shoe
was
pulled
on
again
over
the
bare
foot
then
the
woman
slipped
a
rock
the
size
of
her
fist
into
the
stocking
and
brandishing
this
ancient
and
horrible
weapon
lumbered
into
the
nearest
fray
oh
oh
oh
bert
screamed
with
every
blow
she
struck
hey
old
watch
out
you
get
yours
in
a
second
oh
oh
a
peach
did
you
see
it
hurray
for
the
old
lady
look
at
her
tearin
into
watch
out
old
girl
his
voice
died
away
regretfully
as
the
one
with
the
stocking
whose
hair
had
been
clutched
from
behind
by
another
amazon
was
whirled
about
in
a
dizzy
semicircle
vainly
mary
clung
to
his
arm
shaking
him
back
and
forth
and
remonstrating
ca
you
be
sensible
she
cried
it
awful
i
tell
you
it
awful
but
bert
was
irrepressible
go
it
old
girl
he
encouraged
you
win
me
for
you
every
time
your
chance
swat
oh
my
a
peach
a
peach
it
the
biggest
i
ever
saw
billy
confided
to
saxon
it
sure
takes
the
micks
to
mix
it
but
what
did
that
dude
wanta
do
it
for
that
what
gets
me
he
was
a
bricklayer
not
even
a
workingman
just
a
regular
sissy
dude
that
did
know
a
livin
soul
in
the
grounds
but
if
he
wanted
to
raise
a
he
certainly
done
it
look
at
they
fightin
he
broke
into
sudden
laughter
so
hearty
that
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
what
is
it
saxon
asked
anxious
not
to
miss
anything
it
that
dude
billy
explained
between
gusts
what
did
he
wanta
do
it
for
that
what
gets
my
goat
what
he
wanta
do
it
for
there
was
more
crashing
in
the
brush
and
two
women
erupted
upon
the
scene
one
in
flight
the
other
pursuing
almost
ere
they
could
realize
it
the
little
group
found
itself
merged
in
the
astounding
conflict
that
covered
if
not
the
face
of
creation
at
least
all
the
visible
landscape
of
weasel
park
the
fleeing
woman
stumbled
in
rounding
the
end
of
a
picnic
bench
and
would
have
been
caught
had
she
not
seized
mary
arm
to
recover
balance
and
then
flung
mary
full
into
the
arms
of
the
woman
who
pursued
this
woman
largely
built
and
too
irate
to
comprehend
clutched
mary
hair
by
one
hand
and
lifted
the
other
to
smack
her
before
the
blow
could
fall
billy
had
seized
both
the
woman
wrists
come
on
old
girl
cut
it
out
he
said
appeasingly
you
in
wrong
she
ai
done
then
the
woman
did
a
strange
thing
making
no
resistance
but
maintaining
her
hold
on
the
girl
hair
she
stood
still
and
calmly
began
to
scream
the
scream
was
hideously
compounded
of
fright
and
fear
yet
in
her
face
was
neither
fright
nor
fear
she
regarded
billy
coolly
and
appraisingly
as
if
to
see
how
he
took
it
her
scream
merely
the
cry
to
the
clan
for
help
aw
shut
up
you
battleax
bert
vociferated
trying
to
drag
her
off
by
the
shoulders
the
result
was
that
the
four
rocked
back
and
forth
while
the
woman
calmly
went
on
screaming
the
scream
became
touched
with
triumph
as
more
crashing
was
heard
in
the
brush
saxon
saw
billy
slow
eyes
glint
suddenly
to
the
hardness
of
steel
and
at
the
same
time
she
saw
him
put
pressure
on
his
the
woman
released
her
grip
on
mary
and
was
shoved
back
and
free
then
the
first
man
of
the
rescue
was
upon
them
he
did
not
pause
to
inquire
into
the
merits
of
the
affair
it
was
sufficient
that
he
saw
the
woman
reeling
away
from
billy
and
screaming
with
pain
that
was
largely
feigned
it
all
a
mistake
billy
cried
hurriedly
we
apologize
sport
the
irishman
swung
ponderously
billy
ducked
cutting
his
apology
short
and
as
the
fist
passed
over
his
head
he
drove
his
left
to
the
other
jaw
the
big
irishman
toppled
over
sidewise
and
sprawled
on
the
edge
of
the
slope
back
to
his
feet
and
out
of
balance
he
was
caught
by
bert
fist
and
this
time
went
clawing
down
the
slope
that
was
slippery
with
short
dry
grass
bert
was
redoubtable
that
for
you
old
girl
my
compliments
was
his
cry
as
he
shoved
the
woman
over
the
edge
on
to
the
treacherous
slope
three
more
men
were
emerging
from
the
brush
in
the
meantime
billy
had
put
saxon
in
behind
the
protection
of
the
picnic
table
mary
who
was
hysterical
had
evinced
a
desire
to
cling
to
him
and
he
had
sent
her
sliding
across
the
top
of
the
table
to
saxon
come
on
you
bert
yelled
at
the
newcomers
himself
swept
away
by
passion
his
black
eyes
flashing
wildly
his
dark
face
inflamed
by
the
blood
come
on
you
cheap
skates
talk
about
gettysburg
we
show
you
all
the
americans
ai
dead
yet
shut
your
trap
we
do
want
a
scrap
with
the
girls
here
billy
growled
harshly
holding
his
position
in
front
of
the
table
he
turned
to
the
three
rescuers
who
were
bewildered
by
the
lack
of
anything
visible
to
rescue
go
on
sports
we
do
want
a
row
you
in
wrong
they
ai
nothin
doin
in
the
fight
line
we
do
wanta
fight
d
get
me
they
still
hesitated
and
billy
might
have
succeeded
in
avoiding
trouble
had
not
the
man
who
had
gone
down
the
bank
chosen
that
unfortunate
moment
to
reappear
crawling
groggily
on
hands
and
knees
and
showing
a
bleeding
face
again
bert
reached
him
and
sent
him
downslope
and
the
other
three
with
wild
yells
sprang
in
on
billy
who
punched
shifted
position
ducked
and
punched
and
shifted
again
ere
he
struck
the
third
time
his
blows
were
clean
and
hard
scientifically
delivered
with
the
weight
of
his
body
behind
saxon
looking
on
saw
his
eyes
and
learned
more
about
him
she
was
frightened
but
and
she
was
startled
by
the
disappearance
of
all
depth
of
light
and
shadow
in
his
eyes
they
showed
surface
only
a
hard
bright
surface
almost
glazed
devoid
of
all
expression
save
deadly
seriousness
bert
eyes
showed
madness
the
eyes
of
the
irishmen
were
angry
and
serious
and
yet
not
all
serious
there
was
a
wayward
gleam
in
them
as
if
they
enjoyed
the
fracas
but
in
eyes
was
no
enjoyment
it
was
as
if
he
had
certain
work
to
do
and
had
doggedly
settled
down
to
do
it
scarcely
more
expression
did
she
note
in
the
face
though
there
was
nothing
in
common
between
it
and
the
one
she
had
seen
all
day
the
boyishness
had
vanished
this
face
was
mature
in
a
terrifying
ageless
way
there
was
no
anger
in
it
nor
was
it
even
pitiless
it
seemed
to
have
glazed
as
hard
and
passionlessly
as
his
eyes
something
came
to
her
of
her
wonderful
mother
tales
of
the
ancient
saxons
and
he
seemed
to
her
one
of
those
saxons
and
she
caught
a
glimpse
on
the
well
of
her
consciousness
of
a
long
dark
boat
with
a
prow
like
the
beak
of
a
bird
of
prey
and
of
huge
men
and
one
of
their
faces
it
seemed
to
her
was
his
face
she
did
not
reason
this
she
felt
it
and
visioned
it
as
by
an
unthinkable
clairvoyance
and
gasped
for
the
flurry
of
war
was
over
it
had
lasted
only
seconds
bert
was
dancing
on
the
edge
of
the
slippery
slope
and
mocking
the
vanquished
who
had
slid
impotently
to
the
bottom
but
billy
took
charge
come
on
you
girls
he
commanded
get
onto
yourself
bert
we
got
to
get
outa
this
we
ca
fight
an
he
led
the
retreat
holding
saxon
arm
and
bert
giggling
and
jubilant
brought
up
the
rear
with
an
indignant
mary
who
protested
vainly
in
his
unheeding
ears
for
a
hundred
yards
they
ran
and
twisted
through
the
trees
and
then
no
signs
of
pursuit
appearing
they
slowed
down
to
a
dignified
saunter
bert
the
pricked
his
ears
to
the
muffled
sound
of
blows
and
sobs
and
stepped
aside
to
investigate
oh
look
what
i
found
he
called
they
joined
him
on
the
edge
of
a
dry
ditch
and
looked
down
in
the
bottom
were
two
men
strays
from
the
fight
grappled
together
and
still
fighting
they
were
weeping
out
of
sheer
fatigue
and
helplessness
and
the
blows
they
only
occasionally
struck
were
and
ineffectual
hey
you
sport
throw
sand
in
his
eyes
bert
counseled
that
it
blind
him
an
he
stop
that
billy
shouted
at
the
man
who
was
following
instructions
or

grinned
to
saxon

with
them
an
this
big
scrap
made
the
day
a
howlin
success
what
did
i
tell
you
look
over
at
that
table
a
group
of
disheveled
men
and
women
still
breathing
heavily
were
shaking
hands
all
around
come
on
let
dance
mary
pleaded
urging
them
in
the
direction
of
the
pavilion
all
over
the
park
the
warring
bricklayers
were
shaking
hands
and
making
up
while
the
bars
were
crowded
with
the
drinkers
saxon
walked
very
close
to
billy
she
was
proud
of
him
he
could
fight
and
he
could
avoid
trouble
in
all
that
had
occurred
he
had
striven
to
avoid
trouble
and
also
consideration
for
her
and
mary
had
been
uppermost
in
his
mind
you
are
brave
she
said
to
him
it
like
takin
candy
from
a
baby
he
disclaimed
they
only
they
do
know
boxin
they
wide
open
an
all
you
got
ta
do
is
hit
it
ai
real
fightin
you
with
a
troubled
boyish
look
in
his
eyes
he
stared
at
his
bruised
knuckles
an
have
to
drive
team
with
he
lamented
which
ai
fun
i
tellin
you
when
they
stiffen
chapter
v
at
eight
the
al
vista
band
played
home
sweet
home
and
following
the
hurried
rush
through
the
twilight
to
the
picnic
train
the
four
managed
to
get
double
seats
facing
each
other
when
the
aisles
and
platforms
were
packed
by
the
hilarious
crowd
the
train
pulled
out
for
the
short
run
from
the
suburbs
into
oakland
all
the
car
was
singing
a
score
of
songs
at
once
and
bert
his
head
pillowed
on
mary
breast
with
her
arms
around
him
started
on
the
banks
of
the
and
he
sang
the
song
through
undeterred
by
the
bedlam
of
two
general
fights
one
on
the
adjacent
platform
the
other
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
car
both
of
which
were
finally
subdued
by
special
policemen
to
the
screams
of
women
and
the
crash
of
glass
billy
sang
a
lugubrious
song
of
many
stanzas
about
a
cowboy
the
refrain
of
which
was
bury
me
out
on
the
lone
that
one
you
never
heard
before
my
father
used
to
sing
it
he
told
saxon
who
was
glad
that
it
was
ended
she
had
discovered
the
first
flaw
in
him
he
was
tonedeaf
not
once
had
he
been
on
the
key
i
do
sing
often
he
added
you
bet
your
sweet
life
he
do
bert
exclaimed
his
friends
kill
him
if
he
they
all
make
fun
of
my
singin
he
complained
to
saxon
honest
now
do
you
find
it
as
rotten
as
all
that
it
it
maybe
flat
a
bit
she
admitted
reluctantly
it
do
sound
flat
to
me
he
protested
it
a
regular
josh
on
me
i
bet
bert
put
you
up
to
it
you
sing
something
now
saxon
i
bet
you
sing
good
i
can
tell
it
from
lookin
at
she
began
when
the
harvest
days
are
bert
and
mary
joined
in
but
when
billy
attempted
to
add
his
voice
he
was
dissuaded
by
a
from
bert
saxon
sang
in
a
clear
true
soprano
thin
but
sweet
and
she
was
aware
that
she
was
singing
to
billy
now
that
is
singing
what
is
he
proclaimed
when
she
had
finished
sing
it
again
aw
go
on
you
do
it
just
right
it
his
hand
slipped
to
hers
and
gathered
it
in
and
as
she
sang
again
she
felt
the
tide
of
his
strength
flood
warmingly
through
her
look
at
holdin
hands
bert
jeered
just
hands
like
they
was
afraid
look
at
mary
an
me
come
on
an
kick
in
you
get
together
if
you
do
it
look
suspicious
i
got
my
suspicions
already
you
framin
somethin
there
was
no
mistaking
his
innuendo
and
saxon
felt
her
cheeks
flaming
get
onto
yourself
bert
billy
reproved
shut
up
mary
added
the
weight
of
her
indignation
awfully
raw
bert
wanhope
an
i
wo
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
there
she
withdrew
her
arms
and
shoved
him
away
only
to
receive
him
forgivingly
half
a
dozen
seconds
afterward
come
on
the
four
of
us
bert
went
on
irrepressibly
the
night
young
let
make
a
time
of
it
pabst
cafe
first
and
then
some
what
you
say
bill
what
you
say
saxon
mary
saxon
waited
and
wondered
half
sick
with
apprehension
of
this
man
beside
her
whom
she
had
known
so
short
a
time
nope
he
said
slowly
i
got
ta
get
up
to
a
hard
day
work
and
i
guess
the
girls
has
got
to
saxon
forgave
him
his
here
was
the
kind
of
man
she
always
had
known
existed
it
was
for
some
such
man
that
she
had
waited
she
was
and
her
first
marriage
offer
had
come
when
she
was
sixteen
the
last
had
occurred
only
the
month
before
from
the
foreman
of
the
and
he
had
been
good
and
kind
but
not
young
but
this
one
beside
her
he
was
strong
and
kind
and
good
and
young
she
was
too
young
herself
not
to
desire
youth
there
would
have
been
rest
from
fancy
starch
with
the
foreman
but
there
would
have
been
no
warmth
but
this
man
beside
her
she
caught
herself
on
the
verge
involuntarily
of
pressing
his
hand
that
held
hers
no
bert
do
tease
he
right
mary
was
saying
we
got
to
get
some
sleep
it
fancy
starch
and
all
day
on
our
it
came
to
saxon
with
a
chill
pang
that
she
was
surely
older
than
billy
she
stole
glances
at
the
smoothness
of
his
face
and
the
essential
boyishness
of
him
so
much
desired
shocked
her
of
course
he
would
marry
some
girl
years
younger
than
himself
than
herself
how
old
was
he
could
it
be
that
he
was
too
young
for
her
as
he
seemed
to
grow
inaccessible
she
was
drawn
toward
him
more
compellingly
he
was
so
strong
so
gentle
she
lived
over
the
events
of
the
day
there
was
no
flaw
there
he
had
considered
her
and
mary
always
and
he
had
torn
the
program
up
and
danced
only
with
her
surely
he
had
liked
her
or
he
would
not
have
done
it
she
slightly
moved
her
hand
in
his
and
felt
the
harsh
contact
of
his
teamster
callouses
the
sensation
was
exquisite
he
too
moved
his
hand
to
accommodate
the
shift
of
hers
and
she
waited
fearfully
she
did
not
want
him
to
prove
like
other
men
and
she
could
have
hated
him
had
he
dared
to
take
advantage
of
that
slight
movement
of
her
fingers
and
put
his
arm
around
her
he
did
not
and
she
flamed
toward
him
there
was
fineness
in
him
he
was
neither
like
bert
nor
coarse
like
other
men
she
had
encountered
for
she
had
had
experiences
not
nice
and
she
had
been
made
to
suffer
by
the
lack
of
what
was
termed
chivalry
though
she
in
turn
lacked
that
word
to
describe
what
she
divined
and
desired
and
he
was
a
prizefighter
the
thought
of
it
almost
made
her
gasp
yet
he
answered
not
at
all
to
her
conception
of
a
prizefighter
but
then
he
was
a
prizefighter
he
had
said
he
was
not
she
resolved
to
ask
him
about
it
some
time
if
if
he
took
her
out
again
yet
there
was
little
doubt
of
that
for
when
a
man
danced
with
one
girl
a
whole
day
he
did
not
drop
her
immediately
almost
she
hoped
that
he
was
a
prizefighter
there
was
a
delicious
tickle
of
wickedness
about
it
prizefighters
were
such
terrible
and
mysterious
men
in
so
far
as
they
were
out
of
the
ordinary
and
were
not
mere
common
workingmen
such
as
carpenters
and
laundrymen
they
represented
romance
power
also
they
represented
they
did
not
work
for
bosses
but
spectacularly
and
magnificently
with
their
own
might
grappled
with
the
great
world
and
wrung
splendid
living
from
its
reluctant
hands
some
of
them
even
owned
automobiles
and
traveled
with
a
retinue
of
trainers
and
servants
perhaps
it
had
been
only
billy
modesty
that
made
him
say
he
had
quit
fighting
and
yet
there
were
the
callouses
on
his
hands
that
showed
he
had
quit
chapter
vi
they
said
at
the
gate
billy
betrayed
awkwardness
that
was
sweet
to
saxon
he
was
not
one
of
the
young
men
there
was
a
pause
while
she
feigned
desire
to
go
into
the
house
yet
waited
in
secret
eagerness
for
the
words
she
wanted
him
to
say
when
am
i
goin
to
see
you
again
he
asked
holding
her
hand
in
his
she
laughed
consentingly
i
live
up
in
east
oakland
he
explained
you
know
there
where
the
stable
is
an
most
of
our
teaming
is
done
in
that
section
so
i
do
knock
around
down
this
way
much
but
say
his
hand
tightened
on
hers
we
just
got
ta
dance
together
some
more
i
tell
you
the
orindore
club
has
its
dance
wednesday
if
you
have
a
date
have
you
no
she
said
then
wednesday
what
time
i
come
for
you
and
when
they
had
arranged
the
details
and
he
had
agreed
that
she
should
dance
some
of
the
dances
with
the
other
fellows
and
said
good
night
again
his
hand
closed
more
tightly
on
hers
and
drew
her
toward
him
she
resisted
slightly
but
honestly
it
was
the
custom
but
she
felt
she
ought
not
for
fear
he
might
misunderstand
and
yet
she
wanted
to
kiss
him
as
she
had
never
wanted
to
kiss
a
man
when
it
came
her
face
upturned
to
his
she
realized
that
on
his
part
it
was
an
honest
kiss
there
hinted
nothing
behind
it
rugged
and
kind
as
himself
it
was
virginal
almost
and
betrayed
no
long
practice
in
the
art
of
saying
all
men
were
not
brutes
after
all
was
her
thought
good
night
she
murmured
the
gate
screeched
under
her
hand
and
she
hurried
along
the
narrow
walk
that
led
around
to
the
corner
of
the
house
wednesday
he
called
softly
wednesday
she
answered
but
in
the
shadow
of
the
narrow
alley
between
the
two
houses
she
stood
still
and
pleasured
in
the
ring
of
his
foot
falls
down
the
cement
sidewalk
not
until
they
had
quite
died
away
did
she
go
on
she
crept
up
the
back
stairs
and
across
the
kitchen
to
her
room
registering
her
thanksgiving
that
sarah
was
asleep
she
lighted
the
gas
and
as
she
removed
the
little
velvet
hat
she
felt
her
lips
still
tingling
with
the
kiss
yet
it
had
meant
nothing
it
was
the
way
of
the
young
men
they
all
did
it
but
their
kisses
had
never
tingled
while
this
one
tingled
in
her
brain
as
well
as
on
her
lip
what
was
it
what
did
it
mean
with
a
sudden
impulse
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
the
eyes
were
happy
and
bright
the
color
that
tinted
her
cheeks
so
easily
was
in
them
and
glowing
it
was
a
pretty
reflection
and
she
smiled
partly
in
joy
partly
in
appreciation
and
the
smile
grew
at
sight
of
the
even
rows
of
strong
white
teeth
why
should
billy
like
that
face
was
her
unvoiced
query
other
men
had
liked
it
other
men
did
like
it
even
the
other
girls
admitted
she
was
a
charley
long
certainly
liked
it
from
the
way
he
made
life
miserable
for
her
she
glanced
aside
to
the
rim
of
the
where
his
photograph
was
wedged
shuddered
and
made
a
moue
of
distaste
there
was
cruelty
in
those
eyes
and
brutishness
he
was
a
brute
for
a
year
now
he
had
bullied
her
other
fellows
were
afraid
to
go
with
her
he
warned
them
off
she
had
been
forced
into
almost
slavery
to
his
attentions
she
remembered
the
young
bookkeeper
at
the
laundry
not
a
workingman
but
a
gentleman
whom
charley
had
beaten
up
at
the
corner
because
he
had
been
bold
enough
to
come
to
take
her
to
the
theater
and
she
had
been
helpless
for
his
own
sake
she
had
never
dared
accept
another
invitation
to
go
out
with
him
and
now
wednesday
night
she
was
going
with
billy
billy
her
heart
leaped
there
would
be
trouble
but
billy
would
save
her
from
him
like
to
see
him
try
and
beat
billy
up
with
a
quick
movement
she
jerked
the
photograph
from
its
niche
and
threw
it
face
down
upon
the
chest
of
drawers
it
fell
beside
a
small
square
case
of
dark
and
tarnished
leather
with
a
feeling
as
of
profanation
she
again
seized
the
offending
photograph
and
flung
it
across
the
room
into
a
corner
at
the
same
time
she
picked
up
the
leather
case
springing
it
open
she
gazed
at
the
daguerreotype
of
a
worn
little
woman
with
steady
gray
eyes
and
a
hopeful
pathetic
mouth
opposite
on
the
velvet
lining
done
in
gold
lettering
was
carlton
from
daisy
she
read
it
reverently
for
it
represented
the
father
she
had
never
known
and
the
mother
she
had
so
little
known
though
she
could
never
forget
that
those
wise
sad
eyes
were
gray
despite
lack
of
conventional
religion
saxon
nature
was
deeply
religious
her
thoughts
of
god
were
vague
and
nebulous
and
there
she
was
frankly
puzzled
she
could
not
vision
god
here
in
the
daguerreotype
was
the
concrete
much
she
had
grasped
from
it
and
always
there
seemed
an
infinite
more
to
grasp
she
did
not
go
to
church
this
was
her
high
altar
and
holy
of
holies
she
came
to
it
in
trouble
in
loneliness
for
counsel
divination
and
comfort
in
so
far
as
she
found
herself
different
from
the
girls
of
her
acquaintance
she
quested
here
to
try
to
identify
her
characteristics
in
the
pictured
face
her
mother
had
been
different
from
other
women
too
this
forsooth
meant
to
her
what
god
meant
to
others
to
this
she
strove
to
be
true
and
not
to
hurt
nor
vex
and
how
little
she
really
knew
of
her
mother
and
of
how
much
was
conjecture
and
surmise
she
was
unaware
for
it
was
through
many
years
she
had
erected
this
yet
was
it
all
myth
she
resented
the
doubt
with
quick
jealousy
and
opening
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
chest
drew
forth
a
battered
portfolio
out
rolled
manuscripts
faded
and
worn
and
arose
a
faint
far
scent
of
age
the
writing
was
delicate
and
curled
with
the
quaint
fineness
of
half
a
century
before
she
read
a
stanza
to
herself
sweet
as
a
airy
strains
your
gentle
muse
has
learned
to
sing
and
california
boundless
plains
prolong
the
soft
notes
she
wondered
for
the
thousandth
time
what
a
windlute
was
yet
much
of
beauty
much
of
beyondness
she
sensed
of
this
dimly
remembered
beautiful
mother
of
hers
she
communed
a
while
then
unrolled
a
second
manuscript
to
it
read
to
carlton
brown
she
knew
to
her
father
a
from
her
mother
saxon
pondered
the
opening
lines
i
have
stolen
away
from
the
crowd
in
the
groves
where
the
nude
statues
stand
and
the
leaves
point
and
shiver
at
bacchus
the
queen
of
the
loves
pandora
and
psyche
struck
voiceless
this
too
was
beyond
her
but
she
breathed
the
beauty
of
it
bacchus
and
pandora
and
psyche
talismans
to
conjure
with
but
alas
the
necromancy
was
her
mother
strange
meaningless
words
that
meant
so
much
her
marvelous
mother
had
known
their
meaning
saxon
spelled
the
three
words
aloud
letter
by
letter
for
she
did
not
dare
their
pronunciation
and
in
her
consciousness
glimmered
august
connotations
profound
and
unthinkable
her
mind
stumbled
and
halted
on
the
and
dazzling
boundaries
of
a
world
beyond
her
world
in
which
her
mother
had
roamed
at
will
again
and
again
solemnly
she
went
over
the
four
lines
they
were
radiance
and
light
to
the
world
haunted
with
phantoms
of
pain
and
unrest
in
which
she
had
her
being
there
hidden
among
those
cryptic
singing
lines
was
the
clue
if
she
could
only
grasp
it
all
would
be
made
clear
of
this
she
was
sublimely
confident
she
would
understand
sarah
sharp
tongue
her
unhappy
brother
the
cruelty
of
charley
long
the
justness
of
the
bookkeeper
beating
the
toil
at
the
she
skipped
a
stanza
that
she
knew
was
hopelessly
beyond
her
and
tried
again
the
dusk
of
the
greenhouse
is
luminous
yet
with
quivers
of
opal
and
tremors
of
gold
for
the
sun
is
at
rest
and
the
light
from
the
west
like
delicate
wine
that
is
mellow
and
old
flushes
faintly
the
brow
of
a
naiad
that
stands
in
the
spray
of
a
fountain
whose
tremble
lightly
a
moment
on
bosom
and
hands
then
dip
in
their
basin
from
bosom
and
it
beautiful
just
beautiful
she
sighed
and
then
appalled
at
the
length
of
all
the
poem
at
the
volume
of
the
mystery
she
rolled
the
manuscript
and
put
it
away
again
she
dipped
in
the
drawer
seeking
the
clue
among
the
cherished
fragments
of
her
mother
hidden
soul
this
time
it
was
a
small
package
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
and
tied
with
ribbon
she
opened
it
carefully
with
the
deep
gravity
and
circumstance
of
a
priest
before
an
altar
appeared
a
little
spanish
girdle
like
a
tiny
corset
pointed
the
pioneer
finery
of
a
frontier
woman
who
had
crossed
the
plains
it
was
after
the
model
of
forgotten
days
the
very
whalebone
had
been
of
the
raw
material
from
the
whaleships
traded
for
in
hides
and
tallow
the
black
lace
trimming
her
mother
had
made
the
triple
edging
of
black
velvet
strips
her
mother
hands
had
sewn
the
stitches
saxon
dreamed
over
it
in
a
maze
of
incoherent
thought
this
was
concrete
this
she
understood
this
she
worshiped
as
gods
have
been
worshiped
on
less
tangible
evidence
of
their
sojourn
on
earth
inches
it
measured
around
she
knew
it
out
of
many
verifications
she
stood
up
and
put
it
about
her
waist
this
was
part
of
the
ritual
it
almost
met
in
places
it
did
meet
without
her
dress
it
would
meet
everywhere
as
it
had
met
on
her
mother
closest
of
all
this
survival
of
old
days
brought
saxon
in
touch
hers
was
her
mother
form
physically
she
was
like
her
mother
her
grit
her
ability
to
turn
off
work
that
was
such
an
amazement
to
others
were
her
mother
just
so
had
her
mother
been
an
amazement
to
her
generation
her
mother
the
creature
the
smallest
and
the
youngest
of
the
strapping
pioneer
brood
who
nevertheless
had
mothered
the
brood
always
it
had
been
her
wisdom
that
was
sought
even
by
the
brothers
and
sisters
a
dozen
years
her
senior
daisy
it
was
who
had
put
her
tiny
foot
down
and
commanded
the
removal
from
the
fever
flatlands
of
colusa
to
the
healthy
mountains
of
ventura
who
had
backed
the
savage
old
of
a
father
into
a
corner
and
fought
the
entire
family
that
vila
might
marry
the
man
of
her
choice
who
had
flown
in
the
face
of
the
family
and
of
community
morality
and
demanded
the
divorce
of
laura
from
her
criminally
weak
husband
and
who
on
the
other
hand
had
held
the
branches
of
the
family
together
when
only
misunderstanding
and
weak
humanness
threatened
to
drive
them
apart
the
peacemaker
and
the
warrior
all
the
old
tales
trooped
before
eyes
they
were
sharp
with
detail
for
she
had
visioned
them
many
times
though
their
content
was
of
things
she
had
never
seen
so
far
as
details
were
concerned
they
were
her
own
creation
for
she
had
never
seen
an
ox
a
wild
indian
nor
a
prairie
schooner
yet
palpitating
and
real
shimmering
in
the
dust
of
ten
thousand
hoofs
she
saw
pass
from
east
to
west
across
a
continent
the
great
hegira
of
the
it
was
part
and
fiber
of
her
she
had
been
nursed
on
its
traditions
and
its
facts
from
the
lips
of
those
who
had
taken
part
clearly
she
saw
the
long
the
lean
gaunt
men
who
walked
before
the
youths
goading
the
lowing
oxen
that
fell
and
were
goaded
to
their
feet
to
fall
again
and
through
it
all
a
flying
shuttle
weaving
the
golden
dazzling
thread
of
personality
moved
the
form
of
her
little
indomitable
mother
eight
years
old
and
nine
ere
the
great
traverse
was
ended
a
necromancer
and
a
willing
her
way
and
the
way
and
the
willing
always
good
and
right
saxon
saw
punch
the
little
with
the
honest
eyes
who
had
plodded
for
weary
months
gone
lame
and
abandoned
she
saw
daisy
the
chit
of
a
child
hide
punch
in
the
wagon
she
saw
the
savage
old
worried
father
discover
the
added
burden
of
the
several
pounds
to
the
dying
oxen
she
saw
his
wrath
as
he
held
punch
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
she
saw
daisy
between
the
muzzle
of
the
rifle
and
the
little
dog
and
she
saw
daisy
thereafter
through
days
of
alkali
and
heat
walking
stumbling
in
the
dust
of
the
wagons
the
little
sick
dog
like
a
baby
in
her
arms
but
most
vivid
of
all
saxon
saw
the
fight
at
little
meadow
and
daisy
dressed
as
for
a
gala
day
in
white
a
ribbon
sash
about
her
waist
ribbons
and
a
in
her
hair
in
her
hands
small
step
forth
into
the
sunshine
on
the
open
ground
from
the
wagon
circle
wheels
interlocked
where
the
wounded
screamed
their
delirium
and
babbled
of
flowing
fountains
and
go
on
through
the
sunshine
and
the
of
the
indians
a
hundred
yards
to
the
waterhole
and
back
again
saxon
kissed
the
little
red
satin
spanish
girdle
passionately
and
wrapped
it
up
in
haste
with
dewy
eyes
abandoning
the
mystery
and
godhead
of
mother
and
all
the
strange
enigma
of
living
in
bed
she
projected
against
her
closed
eyelids
the
few
rich
scenes
of
her
mother
that
her
retained
it
was
her
favorite
way
of
wooing
sleep
she
had
done
it
all
her
life
sunk
into
the
of
sleep
with
her
mother
limned
to
the
last
on
her
fading
consciousness
but
this
mother
was
not
the
daisy
of
the
plains
nor
of
the
daguerreotype
they
had
been
before
saxon
time
this
that
she
saw
nightly
was
an
older
mother
broken
with
insomnia
and
brave
with
sorrow
who
crept
always
crept
a
pale
frail
creature
gentle
and
unfaltering
dying
from
lack
of
sleep
living
by
will
and
by
will
refraining
from
going
mad
who
nevertheless
could
not
will
sleep
and
whom
not
even
the
whole
tribe
of
doctors
could
make
sleep
crept
always
she
crept
about
the
house
from
weary
bed
to
weary
chair
and
back
again
through
long
days
and
weeks
of
torment
never
complaining
though
her
unfailing
smile
was
twisted
with
pain
and
the
wise
gray
eyes
still
wise
and
gray
were
grown
unutterably
larger
and
profoundly
deep
but
on
this
night
saxon
did
not
win
to
sleep
quickly
the
little
creeping
mother
came
and
went
and
in
the
intervals
the
face
of
billy
with
the
sullen
handsome
eyes
burned
against
her
eyelids
and
once
again
as
sleep
welled
up
to
smother
her
she
put
to
herself
the
question
is
this
the
man
chapter
vii
the
work
in
the
slipped
off
but
the
three
days
until
wednesday
night
were
very
long
she
hummed
over
the
fancy
starch
that
flew
under
the
iron
at
an
astounding
rate
i
ca
see
how
you
do
it
mary
admired
you
make
thirteen
or
fourteen
this
week
at
that
saxon
laughed
and
in
the
steam
from
the
iron
she
saw
dancing
golden
letters
that
spelled
wednesday
what
do
you
think
of
billy
mary
asked
i
like
him
was
the
frank
answer
well
do
let
it
go
farther
than
i
will
if
i
want
to
saxon
retorted
gaily
better
not
came
the
warning
you
only
make
trouble
for
yourself
he
ai
marryin
many
a
girl
found
that
out
they
just
throw
themselves
at
his
head
i
not
going
to
throw
myself
at
him
or
any
other
just
thought
i
tell
you
mary
concluded
a
word
to
the
saxon
had
become
grave
he
not
not
she
began
than
looked
the
significance
of
the
question
she
could
not
complete
oh
nothin
like
that
though
there
nothin
to
stop
him
straight
all
right
all
right
but
he
just
wo
fall
for
anything
in
skirts
he
dances
an
runs
around
an

a
good
time
an
beyond
that
nitsky
a
lot
of
got
fooled
on
him
i
bet
you
there
a
dozen
girls
in
love
with
him
right
now
an
he
just
goes
on
down
there
was
lily
sanderson
you
know
her
you
seen
her
at
that
slavonic
picnic
last
summer
at
shellmound
that
tall
blonde
that
was
with
butch
willows
yes
i
remember
her
saxon
said
what
about
her
well
she
been
runnin
with
butch
willows
pretty
steady
an
just
because
she
could
dance
billy
dances
a
lot
with
her
butch
ai
afraid
of
nothin
he
wades
right
in
for
a
showdown
an
nails
billy
outside
before
everybody
an
reads
the
riot
act
an
billy
listens
in
that
slow
sleepy
way
of
his
an
butch
gets
hotter
an
hotter
an
everybody
expects
a
scrap
an
then
billy
says
to
butch
you
done
butch
says
said
my
say
an
what
are
you
goin
to
do
about
it
an
billy
says
what
d
think
he
said
with
everybody
lookin
on
an
butch
with
blood
in
his
eye
well
he
said
guess
nothin
butch
just
like
that
butch
was
that
surprised
you
could
knocked
him
over
with
a
feather
never
dance
with
her
no
more
he
says
if
you
say
i
ca
butch
billy
says
just
like
that
well
you
know
any
other
man
to
take
water
the
way
he
did
from
butch
why
everybody
despise
him
but
not
billy
you
see
he
can
afford
to
he
got
a
rep
as
a
fighter
an
when
he
just
stood
back
let
butch
have
his
way
everybody
knew
he
was
scared
or
down
or
anything
he
did
care
a
rap
for
lily
sanderson
that
was
all
an
anybody
could
see
she
was
just
crazy
after
the
telling
of
this
episode
caused
saxon
no
little
worry
hers
was
the
average
woman
pride
but
in
the
matter
of
prowess
she
was
not
unduly
conceited
billy
had
enjoyed
her
dancing
and
she
wondered
if
that
were
all
if
charley
long
bullied
up
to
him
would
he
let
her
go
as
he
had
let
lily
sanderson
go
he
was
not
a
marrying
man
nor
could
saxon
blind
her
eyes
to
the
fact
that
he
was
eminently
marriageable
no
wonder
the
girls
ran
after
him
and
he
was
a
as
well
as
a
men
liked
him
bert
wanhope
seemed
actually
to
love
him
she
remembered
the
butchertown
tough
in
the
at
weasel
park
who
had
come
over
to
the
table
to
apologize
and
the
irishman
at
the
who
had
abandoned
all
thought
of
fighting
with
him
the
moment
he
learned
his
identity
a
very
much
spoiled
young
man
was
a
thought
that
flitted
frequently
through
saxon
mind
and
each
time
she
condemned
it
as
ungenerous
he
was
gentle
in
that
tantalizing
slow
way
of
his
despite
his
strength
he
did
not
walk
over
others
there
was
the
affair
with
lily
sanderson
saxon
analysed
it
again
and
again
he
had
not
cared
for
the
girl
and
he
had
immediately
stepped
from
between
her
and
butch
it
was
just
the
thing
that
bert
out
of
sheer
wickedness
and
love
of
trouble
would
not
have
done
there
would
have
been
a
fight
hard
feelings
butch
turned
into
an
enemy
and
nothing
profited
to
lily
but
billy
had
done
the
right
thing
done
it
slowly
and
imperturbably
and
with
the
least
hurt
to
everybody
all
of
which
made
him
more
desirable
to
saxon
and
less
possible
she
bought
another
pair
of
silk
stockings
that
she
had
hesitated
at
for
weeks
and
on
tuesday
night
sewed
and
drowsed
wearily
over
a
new
shirtwaist
and
earned
complaint
from
sarah
concerning
her
extravagant
use
of
gas
wednesday
night
at
the
orindore
dance
was
not
all
undiluted
pleasure
it
was
shameless
the
way
the
girls
made
up
to
billy
and
at
times
saxon
found
his
easy
consideration
for
them
almost
irritating
yet
she
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
he
hurt
none
of
the
other
fellows
feelings
in
the
way
the
girls
hurt
hers
they
all
but
asked
him
outright
to
dance
with
them
and
little
of
their
open
pursuit
of
him
escaped
her
eyes
she
resolved
that
she
would
not
be
guilty
of
throwing
herself
at
him
and
withheld
dance
after
dance
and
yet
was
secretly
and
thrillingly
aware
that
she
was
pursuing
the
right
tactics
she
deliberately
demonstrated
that
she
was
desirable
to
other
men
as
he
involuntarily
demonstrated
his
own
desirableness
to
the
women
her
happiness
came
when
he
coolly
overrode
her
objections
and
insisted
on
two
dances
more
than
she
had
allotted
him
and
she
was
pleased
as
well
as
angered
when
she
chanced
to
overhear
two
of
the
strapping
young
cannery
girls
the
way
that
little
is
monopolizin
him
said
one
and
the
other
you
think
she
might
have
the
good
taste
to
run
after
somebody
of
her
own
was
the
final
sting
that
sent
the
angry
blood
into
saxon
cheeks
as
the
two
girls
moved
away
unaware
that
they
had
been
overheard
billy
saw
her
home

her
at
the
gate
and
got
her
consent
to
go
with

mary
asked
saxon
nodded
billy
roberts
the
nod
was
repeated
and
mary
with
suspended
iron
gave
her
a
long
and
curious
look
say
an
what
if
charley
long
butts
in
saxon
shrugged
her
shoulders
they
ironed
swiftly
and
silently
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
well
mary
decided
if
he
does
butt
in
maybe
he
get
his
i
like
to
see
him
get
it
the
big
stiff
it
all
depends
how
billy
feels
about
you
i
i
no
lily
sanderson
saxon
answered
indignantly
i
never
give
billy
roberts
a
chance
to
turn
me
you
will
if
charley
long
butts
in
take
it
from
me
saxon
he
ai
no
gentleman
look
what
he
done
to
moody
that
was
a
awful
beatin
an
moody
only
a
quiet
little
man
that
would
harm
a
fly
well
he
wo
find
billy
roberts
a
sissy
by
a
long
that
night
outside
the
laundry
entrance
saxon
found
charley
long
waiting
as
he
stepped
forward
to
greet
her
and
walk
alongside
she
felt
the
sickening
palpitation
that
he
had
so
thoroughly
taught
her
to
know
the
blood
ebbed
from
her
face
with
the
apprehension
and
fear
his
appearance
caused
she
was
afraid
of
the
rough
bulk
of
the
man
of
the
heavy
brown
eyes
dominant
and
confident
of
the
big
and
the
thick
strong
fingers
with
the
on
the
back
to
every
first
joint
he
was
unlovely
to
the
eye
and
he
was
unlovely
to
all
her
finer
sensibilities
it
was
not
his
strength
itself
but
the
quality
of
it
and
the
misuse
of
it
that
affronted
her
the
beating
he
had
given
the
gentle
moody
had
meant
of
horror
to
her
afterward
always
did
the
memory
of
it
come
to
her
accompanied
by
a
shudder
and
yet
without
shock
she
had
seen
billy
fight
at
weasel
park
in
the
same
primitive
way
but
it
had
been
different
she
recognized
but
could
not
analyze
the
difference
she
was
aware
only
of
the
brutishness
of
this
man
hands
and
mind
you
lookin
white
an
all
beat
to
a
frazzle
he
was
saying
why
do
you
cut
the
work
you
got
to
some
time
anyway
you
ca
lose
me
i
wish
i
could
she
replied
he
laughed
with
harsh
joviality
nothin
to
it
saxon
you
just
cut
out
to
be
long
an
you
sure
goin
to
i
wish
i
was
as
certain
about
all
things
as
you
are
she
said
with
mild
sarcasm
that
missed
take
it
from
me
he
went
on
there
just
one
thing
you
can
be
certain
of
an
that
is
that
i
am
he
was
pleased
with
the
cleverness
of
his
idea
and
laughed
approvingly
when
i
go
after
anything
i
get
it
an
if
anything
gets
in
between
it
gets
hurt
d
get
that
it
me
for
you
an
that
all
there
is
to
it
so
you
might
as
well
make
up
your
mind
and
go
to
workin
in
my
home
instead
of
the
laundry
why
it
a
snap
there
would
be
much
to
do
i
make
good
money
an
you
would
want
for
anything

know
i
just
washed

yet
an
that

how
much
i
think
of

and
eat
then
she
advised
though
she
knew
the
futility
of
attempting
to
get
rid
of
him
she
scarcely
heard
what
he
said
it
had
come
upon
her
suddenly
that
she
was
very
tired
and
very
small
and
very
weak
alongside
this
colossus
of
a
man
would
he
dog
her
always
she
asked
despairingly
and
seemed
to
glimpse
a
vision
of
all
her
future
life
stretched
out
before
her
with
always
the
form
and
face
of
the
burly
blacksmith
pursuing
her
come
on
kid
an
kick
in
he
continued
it
the
good
old
summer
time
an
that
the
time

good
dancers
oh

pincher
an
i
know
you

but
i
tell
you
i
ca
she
reiterated
he
shot
a
glance
of
suspicion
at
her
from
under
the
black
thatch
of
brows
that
met
above
his
nose
and
were
as
one
brow
why
ca

date
she
said
who

bloke

of
your
business

long
i

my
business

that
bookkeeper
rummy
well

on
rememberin
him
an
what
he
i
wish
you
leave
me
alone
she
pleaded
resentfully
ca
you
be
kind
just
for
once
the
blacksmith
laughed
unpleasantly
if
any
rummy
thinks
he
can
butt
in
on
you
an
me
he
learn
different
an
i
the
little
boy
that
learn
friday
night
eh
where
i
wo
tell
where
he
repeated
her
lips
were
drawn
in
tight
silence
and
in
her
cheeks
were
little
angry
spots
of
blood
huh
as
if
i
could
guess
germania
hall
well
i
be
there
i
take
you
home
afterward
d
get
that
an
you
better
tell
the
rummy
to
beat
it
unless
you
want
to
see
get
his
face
saxon
hurt
as
a
prideful
woman
can
be
hurt
by
cavalier
treatment
was
tempted
to
cry
out
the
name
and
prowess
of
her
protector
and
then
came
fear
this
was
a
big
man
and
billy
was
only
a
boy
that
was
the
way
he
affected
her
she
remembered
her
first
impression
of
his
hands
and
glanced
quickly
at
the
hands
of
the
man
beside
her
they
seemed
twice
as
large
as
billy
and
the
mats
of
hair
seemed
to
advertise
a
terrible
strength
no
billy
could
not
fight
this
big
brute
he
must
not
and
then
to
saxon
came
a
wicked
little
hope
that
by
the
mysterious
and
unthinkable
ability
that
prizefighters
possessed
billy
might
be
able
to
whip
this
bully
and
rid
her
of
him
with
the
next
glance
doubt
came
again
for
her
eye
dwelt
on
the
blacksmith
broad
shoulders
the
cloth
of
the
coat
and
the
sleeves
bulging
above
the
biceps
if
you
lay
a
hand
on
anybody
i
going
with
again
she
began
why
they
get
hurt
of
course
long
grinned
and
they
deserve
it
too
any
rummy
that
comes
between
a
fellow
an
his
girl
ought
to
get
but
i
not
your
girl
and
all
your
saying
so
does
make
it
that
right
get
mad
he
approved
i
like
you
for
that
too
got
spunk
an
fight
i
like
to
see
it
it
what
a
man
needs
in
his
wife
and
not
these
fat
cows
of
women
they
the
dead
ones
now
a
live
one
all
wool
a
yard
long
and
a
yard
she
stopped
before
the
house
and
put
her
hand
on
the
gate
she
said
i
going
come
on
out
afterward
for
a
run
to
idora
park
he
suggested
no
i
not
feeling
good
and
i
going
straight
to
bed
as
soon
as
i
eat
huh
he
sneered
gettin
in
shape
for
the
fling
night
eh
with
an
impatient
movement
she
opened
the
gate
and
stepped
inside
i
given
it
to
you
straight
he
went
on
if
you
do
go
with
me
night
somebody
get
i
hope
it
will
be
you
she
cried
vindictively
he
laughed
as
he
threw
his
head
back
stretched
his
big
chest
and
his
heavy
arms
the
action
reminded
her
disgustingly
of
a
great
ape
she
had
once
seen
in
a
circus
well
he
said
see
you
night
at
germania
i
have
told
you

told
me

of

mad

chapter
viii
the
music
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
waltz
leaving
billy
and
saxon
at
the
big
entrance
doorway
of
the
ballroom
her
hand
rested
lightly
on
his
arm
and
they
were
promenading
on
to
find
seats
when
charley
long
evidently
just
arrived
thrust
his
way
in
front
of
them
so

buttinsky

he
demanded
his
face
malignant
with
passion
and
menace
who

billy
queried
gently

to
get
your
head
beaten
off
if

yourself
scarce
pretty
i
would
want

to
happen
for
the
world
billy
drawled
come
on
saxon
this
neighborhood
unhealthy
for
he
started
to
go
on
with
her
but
long
thrust
in
front
again
you
too
fresh
to
keep
young
fellow
he
snarled
you
need
down
d
get

billy
scratched
his
head
on
his
face
exaggerated
puzzlement
no

do
get
you
he
said
now
just
what
was
it
you
said
but
the
big
blacksmith
turned
contemptuously
away
from
him
to
saxon
come
here
you
let
see
your
do
you
want
to
dance
with
him
billy
asked
she
shook
her
head
sorry

billy
said
again
making
to
start
on
for
the
third
time
the
blacksmith
blocked
the
way
get
off
your
foot
said
billy
you
standin
on
long
all
but
sprang
upon
him
his
hands
clenched
one
arm
just
starting
back
for
the
punch
while
at
the
same
instant
shoulders
and
chest
were
coming
forward
but
he
restrained
himself
at
sight
of
billy
unstartled
body
and
cold
and
cloudy
eyes
he
had
made
no
move
of
mind
or
muscle
it
was
as
if
he
were
unaware
of
the
threatened
attack
all
of
which
constituted
a
new
thing
in
long
experience
maybe
you
do
know
who
i
am
he
bullied
yep

do
billy
answered
airily
you
a
at
here
long
face
showed
pleasure
you
ought
to
have
the
police
gazette
diamond
belt
for
baby
buggies
i
guess
there
ai
a
one
you
afraid

charley
advised
one
of
the
young
men
who
had
crowded
about
them

bill
roberts
the
fighter
you
know
big
i
do
care
if
he
jim
jeffries
he
ca
butt
in
on
me
this
nevertheless
it
was
noticeable
even
to
saxon
that
the
fire
had
gone
out
of
his
fierceness
billy
name
seemed
to
have
a
quieting
effect
on
obstreperous
males
do
you
know
him
billy
asked
her
she
signified
yes
with
her
eyes
though
it
seemed
she
must
cry
out
a
thousand
things
against
this
man
who
so
steadfastly
persecuted
her
billy
turned
to
the
blacksmith
look
here
sport
you
do
want
trouble
with
me
i
got
your
number
besides
what
do
we
want

she
got
a
say

in
the
matter
no
she
has
this
is
my
affair
an
billy
shook
his
head
slowly
no
you
in
wrong
i
think
she
has
a
say
in
the
well
say
it
then
long
snarled
at
saxon
who
you
goin
to
go
with
me
or
him
let
get
it
for
reply
saxon
reached
her
free
hand
over
to
the
hand
that
rested
on
billy
arm
nuff
said
was
billy
remark
long
glared
at
saxon
then
transferred
the
glare
to
her
protector
i
a
good
mind
to
mix
it
with
you
anyway
long
gritted
through
his
teeth
saxon
was
elated
as
they
started
to
move
away
lily
sanderson
fate
had
not
been
hers
and
her
wonderful
without
the
threat
of
a
blow
slow
of
speech
and
imperturbable
had
conquered
the
big
blacksmith
he
forced
himself
upon
me
all
the
time
she
whispered
to
billy
he
tried
to
run
me
and
beaten
up
every
man
that
came
near
me
i
never
want
to
see
him
billy
halted
immediately
long
who
was
reluctantly
moving
to
get
out
of
the
way
also
halted
she
says
she
do
want
anything
more
to
do
with
you
billy
said
to
him
an
what
she
says
goes
if
i
get
a
whisper
any
time
that
been
botherin
her
i
attend
to
your
case
d
get
that
long
glowered
and
remained
silent
d
get
that
billy
repeated
more
imperatively
a
growl
of
assent
came
from
the
blacksmith
all
right
then
see
you
remember
it
an
now
get
outa
the
way
or
walk
over
long
slunk
back
muttering
inarticulate
threats
and
saxon
moved
on
as
in
a
dream
charley
long
had
taken
water
he
had
been
afraid
of
this
boy
she
was
quit
of
him
something
no
other
man
had
dared
attempt
for
her
and
billy
had
liked
her
better
than
lily
sanderson
twice
saxon
tried
to
tell
billy
the
details
of
her
acquaintance
with
long
but
each
time
was
put
off
i
do
care
a
rap
about
it
billy
said
the
second
time
you
here
ai
you
but
she
insisted
and
when
worked
up
and
angry
by
the
recital
she
had
finished
he
patted
her
hand
soothingly
it
all
right
saxon
he
said
he
just
a
big
stiff
i
took
his
measure
as
soon
as
i
looked
at
him
he
wo
bother
you
again
i
know
his
kind
he
a
dog
roughhouse
he
could
a
milk
but
how
do
you
do
it
she
asked
breathlessly
why
are
men
so
afraid
of
you
you
just
he
smiled
in
an
embarrassed
way
and
changed
the
subject
say
he
said
i
like
your
teeth
they
so
white
an
regular
not
big
an
not
dinky
little
baby
teeth
either
they
just
right
an
they
fit
you
i
never
seen
such
fine
teeth
on
a
girl
yet
d
know
honest
they
kind
of
make
me
hungry
when
i
look
at
they
good
enough
to
at
midnight
leaving
the
insatiable
bert
and
mary
still
dancing
billy
and
saxon
started
for
home
it
was
on
his
suggestion
that
they
left
early
and
he
felt
called
upon
to
explain
it
one
thing
the
fightin
game
taught
me
he
said
to
take
care
of
myself
a
fellow
ca
work
all
day
and
dance
all
night
and
keep
in
condition
it
the
same
way
with
drinkin
an
not
that
i
a
little
tin
angel
i
know
what
it
is
i
been
soused
to
the
guards
an
all
the
rest
of
it
i
like
my
beer
big
schooners
of
it
but
i
do
drink
all
i
want
of
it
i
tried
but
it
do
pay
take
that
big
stiff
that
butted
in
on
us
he
ought
to
had
my
number
he
a
dog
anyway
but
besides
he
had
beer
bloat
i
sized
that
up
the
first
rattle
an
the
difference
about
who
takes
the
other
fellow
number
condition
that
what
it
but
he
is
so
big
saxon
protested
why
his
fists
are
twice
as
big
as
that
do
mean
anything
what
counts
is
what
behind
the
fists
turn
loose
like
a
buckin
bronco
if
i
could
drop
him
at
the
start
all
i
do
is
to
keep
away
smother
up
an
wait
an
all
of
a
sudden
he
blow
up
go
all
to
pieces
you
know
wind
heart
everything
and
then
i
have
him
where
i
wanted
him
and
the
point
is
he
knows
it
you
the
first
prizefighter
i
ever
knew
saxon
said
after
a
pause
i
not
any
more
he
disclaimed
hastily
that
one
thing
the
fightin
game
taught
me
to
leave
it
alone
it
do
pay
a
fellow
trains
as
fine
as
silk
till
he
all
silk
his
skin
everything
and
he
fit
to
live
for
a
hundred
years
an
then
he
climbs
through
the
ropes
for
a
hard
twenty
rounds
with
some
tough
customer
that
just
as
good
as
he
is
and
in
those
twenty
rounds
he
frazzles
out
all
his
silk
an
blows
in
a
year
of
his
life
yes
sometimes
he
blows
in
five
years
of
it
or
cuts
it
in
half
or
uses
up
all
of
it
i
watched
seen
fellows
strong
as
bulls
fight
a
hard
battle
and
die
inside
the
year
of
consumption
or
kidney
disease
or
anything
else
now
what
the
good
of
it
money
ca
buy
what
they
throw
away
that
why
i
quit
the
game
and
went
back
to
drivin
team
i
got
my
silk
an
i
goin
to
keep
it
that
it
must
make
you
feel
proud
to
know
you
are
the
master
of
other
men
she
said
softly
aware
herself
of
pride
in
the
strength
and
skill
of
him
it
does
he
admitted
frankly
i
glad
i
went
into
the
game
just
as
glad
as
i
am
that
i
pulled
out
of
it
yep
it
taught
me
a
lot
to
keep
my
eyes
open
an
my
head
cool
oh
i
got
a
temper
a
peach
of
a
temper
i
get
scared
of
myself
sometimes
i
used
to
be
always
loose
but
the
fightin
taught
me
to
keep
down
the
steam
an
not
do
things
i
be
sorry
for
why
you
the
sweetest
easiest
tempered
man
i
know
she
interjected
do
you
believe
it
just
watch
me
and
sometime
you
see
me
break
out
that
bad
that
i
wo
know
what
i
doin
myself
oh
i
a
holy
terror
when
i
get
started
this
tacit
promise
of
continued
acquaintance
gave
saxon
a
little
say
he
said
as
they
neared
her
neighborhood
what
are
you
next
sunday
nothing
no
plans
at
well
suppose
you
an
me
go
all
day
out
in
the
hills
she
did
not
answer
immediately
and
for
the
moment
she
was
seeing
the
nightmare
vision
of
her
last
of
her
fear
and
her
leap
from
the
buggy
and
of
the
long
miles
and
the
stumbling
through
the
darkness
in
shoes
that
bruised
her
feet
on
every
rock
and
then
it
came
to
her
with
a
great
swell
of
joy
that
this
man
beside
her
was
not
such
a
man
i
love
horses
she
said
i
almost
love
them
better
than
i
do
dancing
only
i
do
know
anything
about
them
my
father
rode
a
great
roan
he
was
a
captain
of
cavalry
you
know
i
never
saw
him
but
somehow
i
always
can
see
him
on
that
big
horse
with
a
sash
around
his
waist
and
his
sword
at
his
side
my
brother
george
has
the
sword
now
but
tom
he
the
brother
i
live
with
says
it
is
mine
because
it
his
father
you
see
they
only
my
i
was
the
only
child
by
my
mother
second
marriage
that
was
her
real
marriage
her
i
saxon
ceased
abruptly
embarrassed
by
her
own
garrulity
and
yet
the
impulse
was
strong
to
tell
this
young
man
all
about
herself
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
these
far
memories
were
a
large
part
of
her
go
on
an
tell
me
about
it
billy
urged
i
like
to
hear
about
the
old
people
of
the
old
days
my
people
was
along
in
there
too
an
somehow
i
think
it
was
a
better
world
to
live
in
than
now
things
was
more
sensible
and
natural
i
do
exactly
say
what
i
mean
but
it
like
this
i
do
understand
life
there
the
labor
unions
employers
associations
an
strikes
an
hard
times
an
for
jobs
an
all
the
rest
things
was
like
that
in
the
old
days
everybody
farmed
an
shot
their
meat
an
got
enough
to
eat
took
care
of
their
old
folks
but
now
it
all
a
that
i
understand
mebbe
i
a
fool
i
do
know
but
anyway
go
ahead
tell
us
about
your
well
you
see
when
she
was
only
a
young
woman
she
and
captain
brown
fell
in
love
he
was
a
soldier
then
before
the
war
and
he
was
ordered
east
for
the
war
when
she
was
away
nursing
her
sister
laura
and
then
came
the
news
that
he
was
killed
at
shiloh
and
she
married
a
man
who
had
loved
her
for
years
and
years
he
was
a
boy
in
the
same
coming
across
the
plains
she
liked
him
but
she
did
love
him
and
afterward
came
the
news
that
my
father
was
killed
after
all
so
it
made
her
very
sad
but
it
did
not
spoil
her
life
she
was
a
good
mother
and
a
good
wife
and
all
that
but
she
was
always
sad
and
sweet
and
gentle
and
i
think
her
voice
was
the
most
beautiful
in
the
she
was
game
all
right
billy
approved
and
my
father
never
married
he
loved
her
all
the
time
i
got
a
lovely
poem
home
that
she
wrote
to
him
it
just
wonderful
and
it
sings
like
music
well
long
long
afterward
her
husband
died
and
then
she
and
my
father
made
their
love
marriage
they
did
get
married
until
and
she
was
pretty
well
more
she
told
him
as
they
stood
by
the
gate
and
saxon
tried
to
think
that
the
kiss
was
a
trifle
longer
than
just
ordinary
how
about
nine
he
queried
across
the
gate
do
bother
about
lunch
or
anything
i
fix
all
that
up
you
just
be
ready
at
chapter
ix
sunday
morning
saxon
was
beforehand
in
getting
ready
and
on
her
return
to
the
kitchen
from
her
second
journey
to
peep
through
the
front
windows
sarah
began
her
customary
attack
it
a
shame
an
a
disgrace
the
way
some
people
can
afford
silk
stockings
she
began
look
at
me
and
day
night
and
i
never
get
silk
stockings
nor
shoes
three
pairs
of
them
all
at
one
time
but
there
a
just
god
in
heaven
and
there
be
some
mighty
big
surprises
for
some
when
the
end
comes
and
folks
get
passed
out
what
comin
to
tom
smoking
his
pipe
and
cuddling
his
on
his
knees
dropped
an
eyelid
surreptitiously
on
his
cheek
in
token
that
sarah
was
in
a
tantrum
saxon
devoted
herself
to
tying
a
ribbon
in
the
hair
of
one
of
the
little
girls
sarah
lumbered
heavily
about
the
kitchen
washing
and
putting
away
the
breakfast
dishes
she
straightened
her
back
from
the
sink
with
a
groan
and
glared
at
saxon
with
fresh
hostility
you
ai
sayin
anything
eh
an
why
do
you
because
i
guess
you
still
got
some
natural
shame
in
you
with
a
prizefighter
oh
i
heard
about
your
with
bill
roberts
a
nice
specimen
he
is
but
just
you
wait
till
charley
long
gets
his
hands
on
him
oh
i
do
know
tom
intervened
bill
roberts
is
a
pretty
good
boy
from
what
i
saxon
smiled
with
superior
knowledge
and
sarah
catching
her
was
infuriated
why
do
you
marry
charley
long
he
crazy
for
you
and
he
ai
a
drinkin
i
guess
he
gets
outside
his
share
of
beer
saxon
retorted
that
right
her
brother
supplemented
an
i
know
for
a
fact
that
he
keeps
a
keg
in
the
house
all
the
time
as
maybe
you
been
guzzling
from
it
sarah
snapped
maybe
i
have
tom
said
wiping
his
mouth
reminiscently
with
the
back
of
his
hand
well
he
can
afford
to
keep
a
keg
in
the
house
if
he
wants
to
she
returned
to
the
attack
which
now
was
directed
at
her
husband
as
well
he
pays
his
bills
and
he
certainly
makes
good
money
better
than
most
men
an
he
has
a
wife
an
children
to
watch
out
for
tom
said
nor
everlastin
dues
to
unions
that
do
do
him
no
oh
yes
he
has
tom
urged
genially
blamed
little
he
work
in
that
shop
or
any
other
shop
in
oakland
if
he
did
keep
in
good
standing
with
the
blacksmiths
you
do
understand
labor
conditions
sarah
the
unions
have
got
to
stick
if
the
men
are
to
starve
to
oh
of
course

sarah
sniffed
i
do
understand
anything
i
ai
got
a
mind

a
fool

right
before
the
she

savagely
on
her
eldest
who

and
shrank

light
of
the
sun
an
beaten
like

nigger
before
the
war
willie
beaten
clubbed
like
a
regular
black
nigger
that
the
kind
of
a

in
a
padded
cell

mother
that

with
the
lunatics
screechin
an
screamin
all
around
an
the
eatin
into
the
dead
bodies
of
them
that
beaten
to
death
by
the
cruel
wardens
she
continued
tirelessly
painting
with
pessimistic
strokes
the
growing
black
future
her
husband
was
meditating
for
her
while
the
boy
fearful
of
some
vague
incomprehensible
catastrophe
began
to
weep
silently
with
a
pendulous
trembling
underlip
saxon
for
the
moment
lost
control
of
herself
oh
for
heaven
sake
ca
we
be
together
five
minutes
without
quarreling
she
blazed
sarah
broke
off
from
asylum
conjurations
and
turned
upon
her
who
quarreling
ca
i
open
my
head
without
bein
jumped
on
by
the
two
of
you
saxon
shrugged
her
shoulders
despairingly
and
sarah
swung
about
on
her
husband
seein
you
love
your
sister
so
much
better
than
your
wife
why
did
you
want
to
marry
me
that
borne
your
children
for
you
an
slaved
for
you
an
toiled
for
you
an
worked
her
fingernails
off
for
you
with
no
thanks
an
me
before
the
children
an
sayin
i
crazy
to
their
faces
an
what
have
you
ever
did
for
me
that
what
i
want
to
know
me
that
cooked
for
you
an
washed
your
stinkin
clothes
and
fixed
your
socks
an
sat
up
nights
with
your
brats
when
they
was
ailin
look
at
that
she
thrust
out
a
shapeless
swollen
foot
encased
in
a
monstrous
untended
shoe
the
dry
raw
leather
of
which
showed
white
on
the
edges
of
bulging
cracks
look
at
that
that
what
i
say
look
at
that
her
voice
was
persistently
rising
and
at
the
same
time
growing
throaty
the
only
shoes
i
got
me
your
wife
ai
you
ashamed
where
are
my
three
pairs
look
at
that
speech
failed
her
and
she
sat
down
suddenly
on
a
chair
at
the
table
glaring
unutterable
malevolence
and
misery
she
arose
with
the
abrupt
stiffness
of
an
automaton
poured
herself
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
and
in
the
same
jerky
way
sat
down
again
as
if
too
hot
for
her
lips
she
filled
her
saucer
with
the
nondescript
fluid
and
continued
her
set
glare
her
breast
rising
and
falling
with
staccato
mechanical
movement
now
sarah
be
be
tom
pleaded
anxiously
in
response
slowly
with
utmost
deliberation
as
if
the
destiny
of
empires
rested
on
the
certitude
of
her
act
she
turned
the
saucer
of
coffee
upside
down
on
the
table
she
lifted
her
right
hand
slowly
hugely
and
in
the
same
slow
huge
way
landed
the
open
palm
with
a
sounding
slap
on
tom
astounded
cheek
immediately
thereafter
she
raised
her
voice
in
the
shrill
hoarse
monotonous
madness
of
hysteria
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
rocked
back
and
forth
in
the
throes
of
an
abysmal
grief
willie
silent
weeping
turned
to
noise
and
the
two
little
girls
with
the
fresh
ribbons
in
their
hair
joined
him
tom
face
was
drawn
and
white
though
the
smitten
cheek
still
blazed
and
saxon
wanted
to
put
her
arms
comfortingly
around
him
yet
dared
not
he
bent
over
his
wife
sarah
you
ai
feelin
well
let
me
put
you
to
bed
and
i
finish
tidying
do
touch
me
do
touch
me
she
screamed
jerking
violently
away
from
him
take
the
children
out
in
the
yard
tom
for
a
walk
anything
get
them
away
saxon
said
she
was
sick
and
white
and
trembling
go
tom
please
please
there
your
hat
i
take
care
of
her
i
know
just
left
to
herself
saxon
worked
with
frantic
haste
assuming
the
calm
she
did
not
possess
but
which
she
must
impart
to
the
screaming
bedlamite
upon
the
floor
the
light
frame
house
leaked
the
noise
hideously
and
saxon
knew
that
the
houses
on
either
side
were
hearing
and
the
street
itself
and
the
houses
across
the
street
her
fear
was
that
billy
should
arrive
in
the
midst
of
it
further
she
was
incensed
violated
every
fiber
rebelled
almost
in
a
nausea
yet
she
maintained
cool
control
and
stroked
sarah
forehead
and
hair
with
slow
soothing
movements
soon
with
one
arm
around
her
she
managed
to
win
the
first
diminution
in
the
strident
atrocious
unceasing
scream
a
few
minutes
later
sobbing
heavily
the
elder
woman
lay
in
bed
across
her
forehead
and
eyes
a
of
towel
for
easement
of
the
headache
she
and
saxon
tacitly
accepted
as
substitute
for
the
when
a
clatter
of
hoofs
came
down
the
street
and
stopped
saxon
was
able
to
slip
to
the
front
door
and
wave
her
hand
to
billy
in
the
kitchen
she
found
tom
waiting
in
sad
anxiousness
it
all
right
she
said
billy
roberts
has
come
and
i
got
to
go
you
go
in
and
sit
beside
her
for
a
while
and
maybe
she
go
to
sleep
but
do
rush
her
let
her
have
her
own
way
if
she
let
you
take
her
hand
why
do
it
try
it
anyway
but
first
of
all
as
an
opener
and
just
as
a
matter
of
course
start
wetting
the
towel
over
her
he
was
a
kindly
man
but
after
the
way
of
a
large
percentage
of
the
western
stock
he
was
undemonstrative
he
nodded
turned
toward
the
door
to
obey
and
paused
irresolutely
the
look
he
gave
back
to
saxon
was
almost
in
gratitude
and
in
love
she
felt
it
and
in
spirit
leapt
toward
it
it
all
right
everything
all
right
she
cried
hastily
tom
shook
his
head
no
it
ai
it
a
shame
a
blamed
shame
that
what
it
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
i
do
care
for
myself
but
it
for
you
you
got
your
life
before
you
yet
little
kid
sister
you
get
old
and
all
that
means
fast
enough
but
it
a
bad
start
for
a
day
off
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
forget
all
this
and
skin
out
with
your
fellow
an
have
a
good
in
the
open
door
his
hand
on
the
knob
to
close
it
after
him
he
halted
a
second
time
a
spasm
contracted
his
brow
hell
think
of
it
sarah
and
i
used
to
go
once
on
a
time
and
i
guess
she
had
her
three
pairs
of
shoes
too
can
you
beat
it
in
her
bedroom
saxon
completed
her
dressing
for
an
instant
stepping
upon
a
chair
so
as
to
glimpse
critically
in
the
small
the
hang
of
her
linen
skirt
this
and
the
jacket
she
had
altered
to
fit
and
she
had
the
seams
to
achieve
the
coveted
tailored
effect
still
on
the
chair
all
in
the
moment
of
quick
she
drew
the
skirt
tightly
back
and
raised
it
the
sight
was
good
to
her
nor
did
she
the
lines
of
the
slender
ankle
above
the
low
tan
tie
nor
did
she
the
delicate
yet
mature
swell
of
calf
outlined
in
the
fresh
brown
of
a
new
cotton
stocking
down
from
the
chair
she
pinned
on
a
firm
sailor
hat
of
white
straw
with
a
brown
ribbon
around
the
crown
that
matched
her
ribbon
belt
she
rubbed
her
cheeks
quickly
and
fiercely
to
bring
back
the
color
sarah
had
driven
out
of
them
and
delayed
a
moment
longer
to
put
on
her
tan
gloves
once
in
the
of
a
sunday
supplement
she
had
read
that
no
lady
ever
put
on
her
gloves
after
she
left
the
door
with
a
resolute
as
she
crossed
the
parlor
and
passed
the
door
to
sarah
bedroom
through
the
thin
wood
of
which
came
elephantine
moanings
and
low
slubberings
she
steeled
herself
to
keep
the
color
in
her
cheeks
and
the
brightness
in
her
eyes
and
so
well
did
she
succeed
that
billy
never
dreamed
that
the
radiant
live
young
thing
tripping
lightly
down
the
steps
to
him
had
just
come
from
a
bout
with
hysteria
and
madness
to
her
in
the
bright
sun
billy
blondness
was
startling
his
cheeks
smooth
as
a
girl
were
touched
with
color
the
blue
eyes
seemed
more
cloudily
blue
than
usual
and
the
crisp
sandy
hair
hinted
more
than
ever
of
the
pale
that
was
not
there
never
had
she
seen
him
quite
so
royally
young
as
he
smiled
to
greet
her
with
a
slow
white
flash
of
teeth
from
between
red
lips
she
caught
again
the
promise
of
easement
and
rest
fresh
from
the
shattering
chaos
of
her
mind
billy
tremendous
calm
was
especially
satisfying
and
saxon
mentally
laughed
to
scorn
the
terrible
temper
he
had
charged
to
himself
she
had
been
before
but
always
behind
one
horse
jaded
and
livery
in
a
heavy
and
dingy
such
as
livery
stables
rent
because
of
sturdy
unbreakableness
but
here
stood
two
horses
and
restless
shouting
in
every
glint
of
their
satin
coats
that
they
had
never
been
rented
out
in
all
their
glorious
young
lives
between
them
was
a
pole
inconceivably
slender
on
them
were
harnesses
preposterously
and
fragile
and
billy
belonged
here
by
elemental
right
a
part
of
them
and
of
it
a
and
a
component
along
with
the
and
rig
efficient
and
capable
as
different
as
he
was
different
from
the
other
man
who
had
taken
her
out
behind
stolid
lumbering
horses
he
held
the
reins
in
one
hand
yet
with
low
steady
voice
confident
and
assuring
held
the
nervous
young
animals
more
by
the
will
and
the
spirit
of
him
it
was
no
time
for
lingering
with
the
quick
glance
and
of
a
woman
saxon
saw
not
merely
the
curious
children
clustering
about
but
the
peering
of
adult
faces
from
open
doors
and
windows
and
past
lifted
up
or
held
aside
with
his
free
hand
billy
drew
back
the
linen
robe
and
helped
her
to
a
place
beside
him
the
luxuriously
upholstered
seat
of
brown
leather
gave
her
a
sense
of
great
comfort
yet
even
greater
it
seemed
to
her
was
the
nearness
and
comfort
of
the
man
himself
and
of
his
body
how
d
like
he
asked
changing
the
reins
to
both
hands
and
chirruping
the
horses
which
went
out
with
a
jerk
in
an
immediacy
of
action
that
was
new
to
her
they
the
boss
you
know
could
rent
animals
like
them
he
lets
me
take
them
out
for
exercise
sometimes
if
they
ai
exercised
regular
they
a
look
at
king
there
prancin
some
style
eh
some
style
the
other
one
the
real
goods
though
prince
is
his
name
got
to
have
some
bit
on
him
to
ah
would
you
did
you
see
saxon
some
horse
some
horse
from
behind
came
the
admiring
cheer
of
the
neighborhood
children
and
saxon
with
a
sigh
of
content
knew
that
the
happy
day
had
at
last
begun
chapter
x
i

saxon
said
i
never

or
something
but
i
not
afraid
of
horses

was
born
loving

i
billy
threw
an
admiring
appreciative
glance
at
her

of

the
time
well
i
guess
you
get
you
have
to
be
born
to
love

she
answered
maybe
because
i
always
think
of
my
father
on
his
roan
that
makes
me
love
horses
but
anyway
i
do
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
was
drawing
horses
all
the
time
my
mother
always
encouraged
me
i
a
scrapbook
mostly
filled
with
horses
i
drew
when
i
was
little
do
you
know
billy
sometimes
i
dream
i
actually
own
a
horse
all
my
own
and
lots
of
times
i
dream
i
on
a
horse
back
or
driving
i
let
you
drive
after
a
while
when
they
worked
their
edge
off
they
pullin
there

your
hands
in
front
of
mine
take
hold
tight

that
sure

you
ai
feelin
it
all
by
a
long
shot
i
do
dast
slack

bein
such
a
her
eyes
sparkled
as
she
felt
the
apportioned
pull
of
the
mouths
of
the
beautiful
live
things
and
he
looking
at
her
sparkled
with
her
in
her
delight
what
the
good
of
a
woman
if
she
ca
keep
up
with
a
man
he
broke
out
enthusiastically
people
that
like
the
same
things
always
get
along
best
together
she
answered
with
a
triteness
that
concealed
the
joy
that
was
hers
at
being
so
spontaneously
in
touch
with
him
why
saxon
i
fought
battles
good
ones
frazzlin
my
silk
away
to
beat
the
band
before
smokin
audiences
of
rotten
that
just
made
me
sick
clean
through
an
them
that
could
take
just
one
stiff
jolt
or
hook
to
jaw
or
stomach
me
an
yellin
for
blood
blood
mind
you
an
them
without
the
blood
of
a
shrimp
in
their
bodies
why
honest
now
i
sooner
fight
before
an
audience
of
one
you
for
instance
or
anybody
i
liked
it
do
me
proud
but
them
sickenin
stiffs
with
the
grit
of
rabbits
and
the
silk
of
mangy
me
me
can
you
blame
me
for
the
dirty
game
why
i
sooner
fight
before
old
plugs
of
that
candidates
for
than
before
them
rotten
bunches
of
stiffs
with
nothin
water
in
their
veins
contra
costa
water
at
that
when
the
rains
is
heavy
on
the
i
i
did
know
prizefighting
was
like
that
she
faltered
as
she
released
her
hold
on
the
lines
and
sank
back
again
beside
him
it
ai
the
fightin
it
the
he
defended
with
instant
jealousy
of
course
fightin
hurts
a
young
fellow
because
it
frazzles
the
silk
outa
him
an
all
that
but
it
the
in
the
audience
that
gets
me
why
the
good
things
they
say
to
me
the
praise
that
is
insulting
do
you
get
me
it
makes
me
cheap
think
of
it
stiffs
that
be
afraid
to
mix
it
with
a
sick
cat
not
fit
to
hold
the
coat
of
any
decent
man
think
of
them
up
on
their
hind
legs
an
yellin
an
cheerin
me
me
ha
ha
what
d
think
of
that
ai
he
a
rogue
a
big
bulldog
sliding
obliquely
and
silently
across
the
street
unconcerned
with
the
team
he
was
avoiding
had
passed
so
close
that
prince
baring
his
teeth
like
a
stallion
plunged
his
head
down
against
reins
and
check
in
an
effort
to
seize
the
dog
now
he
some
fighter
that
prince
an
he
natural
he
did
make
that
reach
just
for
some
to
yell
on
he
just
done
it
outa
pure
cussedness
and
himself
that
clean
that
right
because
natural
but
them
honest
to
god
saxon
and
saxon
glimpsing
him
sidewise
as
he
watched
the
horses
and
their
way
on
the
sunday
morning
streets
checking
them
back
suddenly
and
swerving
to
avoid
two
boys
coasting
across
street
on
a
toy
wagon
saw
in
him
deeps
and
intensities
all
the
magic
connotations
of
temperament
the
glimmer
and
hint
of
rages
profound
bleaknesses
as
cold
and
far
as
the
stars
savagery
as
keen
as
a
wolf
and
clean
as
a
stallion
wrath
as
implacable
as
a
destroying
angel
and
youth
that
was
fire
and
life
beyond
time
and
place
she
was
awed
and
fascinated
with
the
hunger
of
woman
bridging
the
vastness
to
him
daring
to
love
him
with
arms
and
breast
that
ached
to
him
murmuring
to
herself
and
through
all
the
halls
of
her
soul
you
dear
you
honest
to
god
saxon
he
took
up
the
broken
thread
they
times
when
i
hated
them
when
i
wanted
to
jump
over
the
ropes
and
wade
into
them
and

a
short
hook
to
my
head

left
an
a
real
if

ai
serious
that
high
up
where
the
bone
thick

finishes
himself
for
his
bad
thumb
which
i
known
since
he
first

it
as
a
kid
fightin
in
the
sandlot
at
watts
tract

smashes
that
thumb
right
there
on
my
hard
head
back
into

an
an
all
the
old
cords
that
never

theirs
again

dirty
trick
fair

his
hand
on
your
head
but
not
between
friends
i
could
that
to
bill
murphy
for
a

dead
to

world
with
a
skinned
face
on
the
for
a
moment
he
was
still
gazing
straight
before
him
at
the
horses
his
face
hard
and
angry
he
sighed
looked
at
saxon
and
smiled
an
i
quit
the
game
right
there
an
billy
murphy
laughed
at
me
for
it
he
still
follows
it
a
you
know
because
he
works
at
a
good
trade
but
once
in
a
while
when
the
house
needs
paintin
or
the
doctor
bills
are
up
or
his
oldest
kid
wants
a
bicycle
he
jumps
out
makes
fifty
or
a
hundred
bucks
before
some
of
the
clubs
i
want
you
to
meet
him
when
it
comes
handy
he
some
boy
i
tellin
you
but
it
did
make
me
sick
that
again
the
harshness
and
anger
were
in
his
face
and
saxon
amazed
herself
by
doing
unconsciously
what
women
higher
in
the
social
scale
have
done
with
deliberate
sincerity
her
hand
went
out
impulsively
to
his
holding
the
lines
resting
on
top
of
it
for
a
moment
with
quick
firm
pressure
her
reward
was
a
smile
from
lips
and
eyes
as
his
face
turned
toward
her
gee
he
exclaimed
i
never
talk
a
streak
like
this
to
anybody
i
just
hold
my
hush
an
keep
my
thinks
to
myself
but
somehow
i
guess
funny
i
kind
of
have
a
feelin
i
want
to
make
good
with
you
an
why
i
tellin
you
my
thinks
anybody
can
the
way
led
uptown
past
the
city
hall
and
the
fourteenth
street
skyscrapers
and
out
broadway
to
mountain
view
turning
to
the
right
at
the
cemetery
they
climbed
the
piedmont
heights
to
blair
park
and
plunged
into
the
green
coolness
of
jack
hayes
canyon
saxon
could
not
suppress
her
surprise
and
joy
at
the
quickness
with
which
they
covered
the
ground
they
are
beautiful
she
said
i
never
dreamed
i
ever
ride
behind
horses
like
them
i
afraid
i
wake
up
now
and
find
it
a
dream

i
dream

all
the
time
i
give
anything
to

billy
answered

way
the
boss
says
i
a
wooz
at

i
know
he
a
dub
he
do

so
many
two
hundred
of
i
tellin
you
he
thinks

to
god

like
all
his
horses
as
much
as
i
like
the
last
hair
on
the
last
tail
of
the
scrubbiest
of
the
bunch
yet
they
his
would
it
jar

would
it
saxon
laughed
appreciatively
i
just
love
fancy
shirtwaists
an
i
spent
my
life
ironing
some
of
the
beautifullest
ever
seen
it
funny
an
it
is
billy
gritted
his
teeth
in
another
of
his
rages
an
the
way
some
of
them
women
gets
their
shirtwaists
it
makes
me
sick
thinkin
of
you
ironin
you
know
what
i
mean
saxon
they
ai
no
use
wastin
words
over
it
you
know
i
know
everybody
knows
an
it
a
hell
of
a
world
if
men
an
women
sometimes
ca
talk
to
each
other
about
such
his
manner
was
almost
apologetic
yet
it
was
defiantly
and
assertively
right
i
never
talk
this
way
to
other
girls
they
think
i
workin
up
to
designs
on
they
make
me
sick
the
way
they
always
lookin
for
them
designs
but
you
different
i
can
talk
to
you
that
way
i
know
i
got
to
it
the
square
thing
you
like
billy
murphy
or
any
other
man
a
man
can
talk
she
sighed
with
a
great
happiness
and
looked
at
him
with
unconscious
eyes
it
the
same
way
with
me
she
said
the
fellows
i
run
with
never
dared
let
talk
about
such
things
because
i
knew
they
take
advantage
of
it
why
all
the
time
with
them
i
a
feeling
that
cheating
and
lying
to
each
other
playing
a
game
like
at
a
masquerade
she
paused
for
a
moment
hesitant
and
debating
then
went
on
in
a
queer
low
voice
i
have
been
asleep
i
seen
and
heard
i
had
my
chances
when
i
was
that
tired
of
the
laundry
i
have
done
almost
anything
i
could
have
got
those
fancy
shirtwaists
an
all
the
rest
and
maybe
a
horse
to
ride
there
was
a
bank
cashier
married
too
if
you
please
he
talked
to
me
straight
out
i
did
count
you
know
i
was
a
girl
with
a
girl
feelings
or
anything
i
was
nobody
it
was
just
like
a
business
talk
i
learned
about
men
from
him
he
told
me
what
he
do
he
her
voice
died
away
in
sadness
and
in
the
silence
she
could
hear
billy
grit
his
teeth
you
ca
tell
me
he
cried
i
know
it
a
dirty
world
an
unfair
lousy
world
i
ca
make
it
out
they
no
squareness
in
women
with
the
best
that
in
bought
an
sold
like
horses
i
understand
women
that
way
i
do
understand
men
that
way
i
see
how
a
man
gets
anything
but
cheated
when
he
buys
such
things
funny
ai
it
take
my
boss
an
his
horses
he
owns
women
too
he
might
you
just
because
he
got
the
price
an
saxon
you
was
made
for
fancy
shirtwaists
an
all
that
but
honest
to
god
i
ca
see
you
payin
for
them
that
way
it
be
a
crime
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
reined
in
the
horses
around
a
sharp
turn
speeding
down
the
grade
upon
them
had
appeared
an
automobile
with
slamming
of
brakes
it
was
brought
to
a
stop
while
the
faces
of
the
occupants
took
new
lease
of
interest
of
life
and
stared
at
the
young
man
and
woman
in
the
light
rig
that
barred
the
way
billy
held
up
his
hand
take
the
outside
sport
he
said
to
the
chauffeur
nothin
doin
kiddo
came
the
answer
as
the
chauffeur
measured
with
hard
wise
eyes
the
crumbling
edge
of
the
road
and
the
downfall
of
the
outside
bank
then
we
camp
billy
announced
cheerfully
i
know
the
rules
of
the
road
these
animals
ai
automobile
broke
altogether
an
if
you
think
i
goin
to
have
shy
off
the
grade
you
got
another
guess
a
confusion
of
injured
protestation
arose
from
those
that
sat
in
the
car
you
need
be
a
because
you
a
rube
said
the
chauffeur
we
ai
to
hurt
your
horses

out
so
we
can
pass
if
you
do
that
do
you
sport

billy
retort

that
way
to
yours

standin
on

up

on
the
outside
at
the
first
an
we
pass
you
you
got
the
juice
throw
on
the
after
a
nervous
consultation
the
chauffeur
obeyed
and
the
car
backed
up
the
hill
and
out
of
sight
around
the
turn
them
cheap
skates
billy
sneered
to
saxon
with
a
couple
of
gallons
of
gasoline
an
the
price
of
a
machine
they
own
the
roads
your
folks
an
my
folks

about

came
the
chauffeur
voice
from
around
the
bend

a
move

your
foot
billy
retorted
contemptuously
i
when
i
ready
to
come
an
if
you
ai
given
room
enough
i
go
clean
over
you
an
your
load
of
chicken
he
slightly
slacked
the
reins
on
the
restless
animals
and
without
need
of
chirrup
they
took
the
weight
of
the
light
vehicle
and
passed
up
the
hill
and
apprehensively
on
the
inside
of
the
purring
machine
where
was
we
billy
queried
as
the
clear
road
showed
in
front

chapter
xi
the
horses
resting
frequently
and
lathered
by
the
work
had
climbed
the
steep
grade
of
the
old
road
to
moraga
valley
and
on
the
divide
of
the
contra
costa
hills
the
way
descended
sharply
through
the
green
and
sunny
stillness
of
redwood
canyon
say
ai
it
swell
billy
queried
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
indicating
the
circled
the
trickle
of
unseen
water
and
the
summer
hum
of
bees
i
love
it
saxon
affirmed
it
makes
me
want
to
live
in
the
country
and
i
never
me
too
saxon
i
never
lived
in
the
country
in
my
life
an
all
my
folks
was
country
no
cities
then
everybody
lived
in
the
i
guess
you
right
he
nodded
they
just
had
to
live
in
the
there
was
no
brake
on
the
light
carriage
and
billy
became
absorbed
in
managing
his
team
down
the
steep
winding
road
saxon
leaned
back
eyes
closed
with
a
feeling
of
ineffable
rest
time
and
again
he
shot
glances
at
her
closed
eyes
what
the
matter
he
asked
finally
in
mild
alarm
you
ai
sick
it
so
beautiful
i
afraid
to
look
she
answered
it
so
brave
it
brave
now
that
is
it
but
it
just
makes
me
feel
that
way
it
brave
now
the
houses
and
streets
and
things
in
the
city
are
brave
but
this
is
i
do
know
why
it
just
by
golly
i
think
you
right
he
exclaimed
it
strikes
me
that
way
now
you
speak
of
it
they
ai
no
games
or
tricks
here
no
an
no
lyin
them
trees
just
stand
up
natural
an
strong
an
clean
like
young
boys
their
first
time
in
the
ring
before
they
learned
its
rottenness
an
how
to
an
lay
down
to
the
bettin
odds
the
yep
it
is
brave
say
saxon
you
see
things
do
you
his
pause
was
almost
wistful
and
he
looked
at
her
and
studied
her
with
a
caressing
softness
that
ran
through
her
in
resurgent
thrills
d
know
i
just
like
you
to
see
me
fight
some
time
a
real
fight
with
something
doin
every
moment
i
be
proud
to
death
to
do
it
for
you
an
i
sure
fight
some
with
you
lookin
on
an
understandin
that
be
a
fight
what
is
take
it
from
me
an
that
funny
too
i
never
wanted
to
fight
before
a
woman
in
my
life
they
squeal
and
screech
an
understand
but
you
understand
it
dead
open
an
shut
you
a
little
later
swinging
along
the
flat
of
the
valley
through
the
little
clearings
of
the
farmers
and
the
ripe
golden
in
the
sunshine
billy
turned
to
saxon
again
say
you
ben
in
love
with
fellows
lots
of
times
tell
me
about
it
what
it
like
she
shook
her
head
slowly
i
only
thought
i
was
in
love
and
not
many
times
either
many
times
he
cried
not
really
ever
she
assured
him
secretly
exultant
at
his
unconscious
jealousy
i
never
was
really
in
love
if
i
had
been
i
be
married
now
you
see
i
could
see
anything
else
to
it
but
to
marry
a
man
if
i
loved
but
suppose
he
did
love
you
oh
i
do
know
she
smiled
half
with
facetiousness
and
half
with
certainty
and
pride
i
think
i
could
make
him
love
i
guess
you
sure
could
billy
proclaimed
enthusiastically
the
trouble
is
she
went
on
the
men
that
loved
me
i
never
cared
for
that
oh
look
a
cottontail
rabbit
had
scuttled
across
the
road
and
a
tiny
dust
cloud
lingered
like
smoke
marking
the
way
of
his
flight
at
the
next
turn
a
dozen
quail
exploded
into
the
air
from
under
the
noses
of
the
horses
billy
and
saxon
exclaimed
in
mutual
delight
gee
he
muttered
i
almost
wisht
i
ben
born
a
farmer
folks
made
to
live
in
not
our
kind
at
least
she
agreed
followed
a
pause
and
a
long
sigh
it
all
so
beautiful
it
would
be
a
dream
just
to
live
all
your
life
in
it
i
like
to
be
an
indian
squaw
several
times
billy
checked
himself
on
the
verge
of
speech
about
those
fellows
you
thought
you
was
in
love
with
he
said
finally
you
ai
told
me
you
want
to
know
she
asked
they
did
amount
to
of
course
i
want
to
know
go
ahead
fire
well
first
there
was
al
stanley
what
did
he
do
for
a
livin
billy
demanded
almost
as
with
authority
he
was
a
billy
face
abruptly
stiffened
and
she
could
see
his
eyes
cloudy
with
doubt
in
the
quick
glance
he
flung
at
her
oh
it
was
all
right
she
laughed
i
was
only
eight
years
old
you
see
i
beginning
at
the
beginning
it
was
after
my
mother
died
and
when
i
was
adopted
by
cady
he
kept
a
hotel
and
saloon
it
was
down
in
los
angeles
just
a
small
hotel
workingmen
just
common
laborers
mostly
and
some
railroad
men
stopped
at
it
and
i
guess
al
stanley
got
his
share
of
their
wages
he
was
so
handsome
and
so
quiet
and
and
he
had
the
nicest
eyes
and
the
softest
cleanest
hands
i
can
see
them
now
he
played
with
me
sometimes
in
the
afternoon
and
gave
me
candy
and
little
presents
he
used
to
sleep
most
of
the
day
i
did
know
why
then
i
thought
he
was
a
fairy
prince
in
disguise
and
then
he
got
killed
right
in
the
but
first
he
killed
the
man
that
killed
him
so
that
was
the
end
of
that
love
affair
next
was
after
the
asylum
when
i
was
thirteen
and
living
with
my
brother
i
lived
with
him
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
that
drove
a
bakery
wagon
almost
every
morning
on
the
way
to
school
i
used
to
pass
him
he
would
come
driving
down
wood
street
and
turn
in
on
twelfth
maybe
it
was
because
he
drove
a
horse
that
attracted
me
anyway
i
must
have
loved
him
for
a
couple
of
months
then
he
lost
his
job
or
something
for
another
boy
drove
the
wagon
and
we
never
even
spoken
to
each
other
then
there
was
a
bookkeeper
when
i
was
sixteen
i
seem
to
run
to
bookkeepers
it
was
a
bookkeeper
at
the
laundry
that
charley
long
beat
up
this
other
one
was
when
i
was
working
in
hickmeyer
cannery
he
had
soft
hands
too
but
i
quickly
got
all
i
wanted
of
him
he
was
well
anyway
he
had
ideas
like
your
boss
and
i
never
really
did
love
him
truly
and
honest
billy
i
felt
from
the
first
that
he
was
just
right
and
when
i
was
working
in
the
factory
i
thought
i
loved
a
clerk
in
kahn
emporium
you
know
on
eleventh
and
washington
he
was
all
right
that
was
the
trouble
with
him
he
was
too
much
all
right
he
did
have
any
life
in
him
any
go
he
wanted
to
marry
me
though
but
somehow
i
could
see
it
that
shows
i
did
love
him
he
was
and
skinny
and
his
hands
were
always
cold
and
fishy
but
my
he
could
dress
just
like
he
came
out
of
a
bandbox
he
said
he
was
going
to
drown
himself
and
all
kinds
of
things
but
i
broke
with
him
just
the
same
and
after
that
well
there
is
any
after
that
i
must
have
got
particular
i
guess
but
i
did
see
anybody
i
could
love
it
seemed
more
like
a
game
with
the
men
i
met
or
a
fight
and
we
never
fought
fair
on
either
side
seemed
as
if
we
always
had
cards
up
our
sleeves
we
were
honest
or
outspoken
but
instead
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
trying
to
take
advantage
of
each
other
charley
long
was
honest
though
and
so
was
that
bank
cashier
and
even
they
made
me
have
the
fight
feeling
harder
than
ever
all
of
them
always
made
me
feel
i
had
to
take
care
of
myself
they
would
that
was
she
stopped
and
looked
with
interest
at
the
clean
profile
of
his
face
as
he
watched
and
guided
the
horses
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
and
her
eyes
laughed
lazily
into
his
as
she
stretched
her
arms
that
all
she
concluded
i
told
you
everything
which
i
never
done
before
to
any
one
and
it
your
turn
not
much
of
a
turn
saxon
i
never
cared
for
girls
that
is
not
enough
to
want
to
marry
i
always
liked
men
better
fellows
like
billy
murphy
besides
i
guess
i
was
too
interested
in
trainin
fightin
to
bother
with
women
much
why
saxon
honest
while
i
ben
altogether
good
you
understand
what
i
mean
just
the
same
i
never
talked
love
to
a
girl
in
my
life
they
was
no
call
the
girls
have
loved
you
just
the
same
she
teased
while
in
her
heart
was
a
curious
elation
at
his
virginal
confession
he
devoted
himself
to
the
horses
lots
of
them
she
urged
still
he
did
not
reply
now
have
they
well
it
was
my
fault
he
said
slowly
if
they
wanted
to
look
sideways
at
me
it
was
up
to
them
and
it
was
up
to
me
to
sidestep
if
i
wanted
to
was
it
you
no
idea
saxon
how
a
prizefighter
is
run
after
why
sometimes
it
seemed
to
me
that
girls
an
women
ai
got
an
ounce
of
natural
shame
in
their
oh
i
was
never
afraid
of
them
believe
muh
but
i
did
hanker
after
a
man
a
fool
let
them
kind
get
his
maybe
you
have
got
love
in
you
she
challenged
maybe
i
have
was
his
discouraging
reply
anyway
i
see
myself
lovin
a
girl
that
runs
after
me
it
all
right
for
but
a
man
that
is
a
man
do
like
bein
chased
by
my
mother
always
said
that
love
was
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
saxon
argued
she
wrote
poems
about
it
too
some
of
them
were
published
in
the
san
jose
what
do
you
think
about
it
oh
i
do
know
she
baffled
meeting
his
eyes
with
another
lazy
smile
all
i
know
is
it
pretty
good
to
be
alive
a
day
like
on
a
trip
like
this
you
bet
it
is
he
added
promptly
at
one
billy
turned
off
the
road
and
drove
into
an
open
space
among
the
trees
here
where
we
eat
he
announced
i
thought
it
be
better
to
have
a
lunch
by
ourselves
than
stop
at
one
of
these
roadside
dinner
counters
an
now
just
to
make
everything
safe
an
comfortable
i
goin
to
unharness
the
horses
we
got
lots
of
time
you
can
get
the
lunch
basket
out
an
spread
it
on
the
as
saxon
unpacked
the
basket
she
was
appalled
at
his
extravagance
she
spread
an
amazing
array
of
ham
and
chicken
sandwiches
crab
salad
eggs
pickled
pigs
feet
ripe
olives
and
dill
pickles
swiss
cheese
salted
almonds
oranges
and
bananas
and
several
pint
bottles
of
beer
it
was
the
quantity
as
well
as
the
variety
that
bothered
her
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
reckless
attempt
to
buy
out
a
whole
delicatessen
shop
you
ought
to
blow
yourself
that
way
she
reproved
him
as
he
sat
down
beside
her
why
it
enough
for
half
a
dozen
it
all
right
is
it
yes
she
acknowledged
but
that
the
trouble
it
too
much
then
it
all
right
he
concluded
i
always
believe
in
havin
plenty
have
some
beer
to
wash
the
dust
away
before
we
begin
watch
out
for
the
glasses
i
got
ta
return
later
the
meal
finished
he
lay
on
his
back
smoking
a
cigarette
and
questioned
her
about
her
earlier
history
she
had
been
telling
him
of
her
life
in
her
brother
house
where
she
paid
four
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
board
at
fifteen
she
had
graduated
from
grammar
school
and
gone
to
work
in
the
jute
mills
for
four
dollars
a
week
three
of
which
she
had
paid
to
sarah
how
about
that
saloonkeeper
billy
asked
how
come
it
he
adopted
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
know
except
that
all
my
relatives
were
hard
up
it
seemed
they
just
could
get
on
they
managed
to
scratch
a
lean
living
for
themselves
and
that
was
all
cady
he
was
the
saloonkeeper
had
been
a
soldier
in
my
father
company
and
he
always
swore
by
captain
kit
which
was
their
nickname
for
him
my
father
had
kept
the
surgeons
from
amputating
his
leg
in
the
war
and
he
never
forgot
it
he
was
making
money
in
the
hotel
and
saloon
and
i
found
out
afterward
he
helped
out
a
lot
to
pay
the
doctors
and
to
bury
my
mother
alongside
of
father
i
was
to
go
to
uncle
will
that
was
my
wish
but
there
had
been
fighting
up
in
the
ventura
mountains
where
his
ranch
was
and
men
had
been
killed
it
was
about
fences
and
cattlemen
or
something
and
anyway
he
was
in
jail
a
long
time
and
when
he
got
his
freedom
the
lawyers
had
got
his
ranch
he
was
an
old
man
then
and
broken
and
his
wife
took
sick
and
he
got
a
job
as
night
watchman
for
forty
dollars
a
month
so
he
could
do
anything
for
me
and
cady
adopted
me
cady
was
a
good
man
if
he
did
run
a
saloon
his
wife
was
a
big
woman
i
do
think
she
was
all
right
and
heard
so
since
but
she
was
good
to
me
i
do
care
what
they
say
about
her
or
what
she
was
she
was
awful
good
to
me
after
he
died
she
went
altogether
bad
and
so
i
went
into
the
orphan
asylum
it
was
any
too
good
there
and
i
had
three
years
of
it
and
then
tom
had
married
and
settled
down
to
steady
work
and
he
took
me
out
to
live
with
him
and
well
i
been
working
pretty
steady
ever
she
gazed
sadly
away
across
the
fields
until
her
eyes
came
to
rest
on
a
fence
with
poppies
at
its
base
billy
who
from
his
supine
position
had
been
looking
up
at
her
studying
and
pleasuring
in
the
pointed
oval
of
her
woman
face
reached
his
hand
out
slowly
as
he
murmured
you
poor
little
his
hand
closed
sympathetically
on
her
bare
forearm
and
as
she
looked
down
to
greet
his
eyes
she
saw
in
them
surprise
and
delight
say
ai
your
skin
cool
though
he
said
now
me
i
always
warm
feel
my
it
was
warmly
moist
and
she
noted
microscopic
beads
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
and
upper
lip
my
but
you
are
she
bent
to
him
and
with
her
handkerchief
dabbed
his
lip
and
forehead
dry
then
dried
his
palms
i
breathe
through
my
skin
i
guess
he
explained
the
wise
guys
in
the
trainin
camps
and
gyms
say
it
a
good
sign
for
health
but
somehow
i
sweatin
more
than
usual
now
funny
ai
it
she
had
been
forced
to
unclasp
his
hand
from
her
arm
in
order
to
dry
it
and
when
she
finished
it
returned
to
its
old
position
but
say
ai
your
skin
cool
he
repeated
with
renewed
wonder
soft
as
velvet
too
an
smooth
as
silk
it
feels
gently
explorative
he
slid
his
hand
from
wrist
to
elbow
and
came
to
rest
half
way
back
tired
and
languid
from
the
morning
in
the
sun
she
found
herself
thrilling
to
his
touch
and
deciding
that
here
was
a
man
she
could
love
hands
and
all
now
i
taken
the
cool
all
out
of
that
he
did
not
look
up
to
her
and
she
could
see
the
roguish
smile
that
curled
on
his
lips
so
i
guess
i
try
he
shifted
his
hand
along
her
arm
with
soft
sensuousness
and
she
looking
down
at
his
lips
remembered
the
long
tingling
they
had
given
hers
the
first
time
they
had
met
go
on
and
talk
he
urged
after
a
delicious
five
minutes
of
silence
i
like
to
watch
your
lips
talking
it
funny
but
every
move
they
make
looks
like
a
tickly
greatly
she
wanted
to
stay
where
she
was
instead
she
said
if
i
talk
you
wo
like
what
i
go
on
he
insisted
you
ca
say
anything
i
wo
well
there
some
poppies
over
there
by
the
fence
i
want
to
pick
and
then
it
time
for
us
to
be
i
lose
he
laughed
but
you
made
tickle
kisses
just
the
same
i
counted
i
tell
you
what
you
sing
the
harvest
days
are
over
and
let
me
have
your
other
cool
arm
while
you
doin
it
and
then
we
she
sang
looking
down
into
his
eyes
which
were
centered
not
on
hers
but
on
her
lips
when
she
finished
she
slipped
his
hands
from
her
arms
and
got
up
he
was
about
to
start
for
the
horses
when
she
held
her
jacket
out
to
him
despite
the
independence
natural
to
a
girl
who
earned
her
own
living
she
had
an
innate
love
of
the
little
services
and
finenesses
and
also
she
remembered
from
her
childhood
the
talk
by
the
pioneer
women
of
the
courtesy
and
attendance
of
the
caballeros
of
the
days
sunset
greeted
them
when
after
a
wide
circle
to
the
east
and
south
they
cleared
the
divide
of
the
contra
costa
hills
and
began
dropping
down
the
long
grade
that
led
past
redwood
peak
to
fruitvale
beneath
them
stretched
the
flatlands
to
the
bay
checkerboarded
into
fields
and
broken
by
the
towns
of
elmhurst
san
leandro
and
haywards
the
smoke
of
oakland
filled
the
western
sky
with
haze
and
murk
while
beyond
across
the
bay
they
could
see
the
first
winking
lights
of
san
francisco
darkness
was
on
them
and
billy
had
become
curiously
silent
for
half
an
hour
he
had
given
no
recognition
of
her
existence
save
once
when
the
chill
evening
wind
caused
him
to
tuck
the
robe
tightly
about
her
and
himself
half
a
dozen
times
saxon
found
herself
on
the
verge
of
the
remark
what
on
your
mind
but
each
time
let
it
remain
unuttered
she
sat
very
close
to
him
the
warmth
of
their
bodies
intermingled
and
she
was
aware
of
a
great
restfulness
and
content
say
saxon
he
began
abruptly
it
no
use
my
holdin
it
in
any
longer
it
ben
in
my
mouth
all
day
ever
since
lunch
what
the
matter
with
you
an
me
gettin
married
she
knew
very
quietly
and
very
gladly
that
he
meant
it
instinctively
she
was
impelled
to
hold
off
to
make
him
woo
her
to
make
herself
more
desirably
valuable
ere
she
yielded
further
her
woman
sensitiveness
and
pride
were
offended
she
had
never
dreamed
of
so
forthright
and
bald
a
proposal
from
the
man
to
whom
she
would
give
herself
the
simplicity
and
directness
of
billy
proposal
constituted
almost
a
hurt
on
the
other
hand
she
wanted
him
so
much
how
much
she
had
not
realized
until
now
when
he
had
so
unexpectedly
made
himself
accessible
well
you
got
ta
say
something
saxon
hand
it
to
me
good
or
bad
but
anyway
hand
it
to
me
an
just
take
into
consideration
that
i
love
you
why
i
love
you
like
the
very
devil
saxon
i
must
because
i
you
to
marry
me
an
i
never
asked
any
girl
that
another
silence
fell
and
saxon
found
herself
dwelling
on
the
warmth
tingling
now
under
the
when
she
realized
whither
her
thoughts
led
she
blushed
guiltily
in
the
darkness
how
old
are
you
billy
she
questioned
with
a
suddenness
and
irrelevance
as
disconcerting
as
his
first
words
had
been
he
answered
i
am
as
if
i
did
know
when
you
left
the
orphan
asylum
and
how
old
you
were
how
long
you
worked
in
the
jute
mills
the
cannery
the
factory
the
laundry
maybe
you
think
i
ca
do
addition
i
knew
how
old
you
was
even
to
your
that
does
change
the
fact
that
i
two
years
what
of
it
if
it
counted
for
anything
i
would
be
lovin
you
would
i
your
mother
was
dead
right
love
the
big
stuff
it
what
counts
do
you
see
i
just
love
you
an
i
got
ta
have
you
it
natural
i
guess
and
i
always
found
with
horses
dogs
and
other
folks
that
what
natural
is
right
there
no
gettin
away
from
it
saxon
i
got
ta
have
you
an
i
just
hopin
hard
you
got
ta
have
me
maybe
my
hands
ai
soft
like
bookkeepers
an
clerks
but
they
can
work
for
you
fight
like
sam
hill
for
you
and
saxon
they
can
love
the
old
sex
antagonism
which
she
had
always
experienced
with
men
seemed
to
have
vanished
she
had
no
sense
of
being
on
the
defensive
this
was
no
game
it
was
what
she
had
been
looking
for
and
dreaming
about
before
billy
she
was
defenseless
and
there
was
an
in
the
knowledge
she
could
deny
him
nothing
not
even
if
he
proved
to
be
like
the
others
and
out
of
the
greatness
of
the
thought
rose
a
greater
thought
he
would
not
so
prove
himself
she
did
not
speak
instead
in
a
glow
of
spirit
and
flesh
she
reached
out
to
his
left
hand
and
gently
tried
to
remove
it
from
the
rein
he
did
not
understand
but
when
she
persisted
he
shifted
the
rein
to
his
right
and
let
her
have
her
will
with
the
other
hand
her
head
bent
over
it
and
she
kissed
the
teamster
callouses
for
the
moment
he
was
stunned
you
mean
it
he
stammered
for
reply
she
kissed
the
hand
again
and
murmured
i
love
your
hands
billy
to
me
they
are
the
most
beautiful
hands
in
the
world
and
it
would
take
hours
of
talking
to
tell
you
all
they
mean
to
whoa
he
called
to
the
horses
he
pulled
them
in
to
a
standstill
soothed
them
with
his
voice
and
made
the
reins
fast
around
the
whip
then
he
turned
to
her
with
arms
around
her
and
lips
to
lips
oh
billy
i
make
you
a
good
wife
she
sobbed
when
the
kiss
was
broken
he
kissed
her
wet
eyes
and
found
her
lips
again
now
you
know
what
i
was
thinkin
and
why
i
was
sweatin
when
we
was
eatin
lunch
just
seemed
i
could
hold
in
much
longer
from
you
why
you
know
you
looked
good
to
me
from
the
first
moment
i
spotted
and
i
think
i
loved
you
from
that
first
day
too
billy
and
i
was
so
proud
of
you
all
that
day
you
were
so
kind
and
gentle
and
so
strong
and
the
way
the
men
all
respected
you
and
the
girls
all
wanted
you
and
the
way
you
fought
those
three
irishmen
when
i
was
behind
the
picnic
table
i
could
love
or
marry
a
man
i
was
proud
of
and
i
so
proud
of
you
so
not
half
as
much
as
i
am
right
now
of
myself
he
answered
for
having
won
you
it
too
good
to
be
true
maybe
the
alarm
clock
go
off
and
wake
me
up
in
a
couple
of
minutes
well
anyway
if
it
does
i
to
make
the
best
of
them
two
minutes
first
watch
out
i
do
eat
you
i
that
hungry
for
he
smothered
her
in
an
embrace
holding
her
so
tightly
to
him
that
it
almost
hurt
after
what
was
to
her
an
period
of
bliss
his
arms
relaxed
and
he
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
draw
himself
together
an
the
clock
ai
gone
off
yet
he
whispered
against
her
cheek
and
it
a
dark
night
an
there
fruitvale
right
ahead
an
if
there
ai
king
and
prince
standin
still
in
the
middle
of
the
road
i
never
thought
the
time
come
when
i
would
want
to
take
the
ribbons
on
a
fine
pair
of
horses
but
this
is
that
time
i
just
ca
let
go
of
you
and
i
got
ta
some
time
it
hurts
poison
but
here
he
restored
her
to
herself
tucked
the
disarranged
robe
about
her
and
chirruped
to
the
impatient
team
half
an
hour
later
he
called
whoa
i
know
i
awake
now
but
i
do
know
but
maybe
i
dreamed
all
the
rest
and
i
just
want
to
make
and
again
he
made
the
reins
fast
and
took
her
in
his
arms
chapter

the
days
flew
by
for
saxon
she
worked
on
steadily
at
the
laundry
even
doing
more
overtime
than
usual
and
all
her
free
waking
hours
were
devoted
to
preparations
for
the
great
change
and
to
billy
he
had
proved
himself
god
own
impetuous
lover
by
insisting
on
getting
married
the
next
day
after
the
proposal
and
then
by
resolutely
refusing
to
compromise
on
more
than
a
week
delay
why
wait
he
demanded
we
not
gettin
any
younger
so
far
as
i
can
notice
an
think
of

fresh
thought

she
nodded
with
no
betrayal
on
her
face
of
the
myriad
secret
economies
that
filled
her
mind
a
hint
of
moisture
glistened
in
her
eyes
you
so
good
to
me
billy
she
murmured
as
she
came
to
him
and
was
met
inside
his
arms
so

an
done

mary
commented
one
morning
in
the
laundry
they
had
not
been
at
work
ten
minutes
ere
her
eye
had
glimpsed
the
topaz
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
saxon
left
hand
who
the
lucky
one
charley
long
or
billy
roberts
billy
was
the
answer
huh

i
know
when

it
to
be
going
home
from
the
laundry
a
few
days
later
saxon
encountered
charley
long
he
blocked
the
sidewalk
and
compelled
speech
with
her
so
you
runnin
with
a
prizefighter
he
sneered
a
blind
man
can
see
your
for
the
first
time
she
was
unafraid
of
this
man
with
the
hands
and
fingers
she
held
up
her
left
hand
see
that
it
something
with
all
your
strength
that
you
could
never
put
on
my
finger
billy
roberts
put
it
on
inside
a
week
he
got
your
number
charley
long
and
at
the
same
time
he
got
skiddoo
for
you
long
retorted
your
he
not
like
you
saxon
went
on
he
a
man
every
bit
of
him
a
fine
clean
long
laughed
hoarsely
he
got
your
goat
all
and
yours
she
flashed
back
i
could
tell
you
things
about
him
saxon
straight
he
ai
no
good
if
i
was
to
tell
you
you
better
get
out
of
my
way
she
interrupted
or
i
tell
him
and
you
know
what
you
get
you
great
big
long
shuffled
uneasily
then
reluctantly
stepped
aside
you
a
caution
he
said
half
admiringly
so
billy
roberts
she
laughed
and
continued
on
her
way
after
half
a
dozen
steps
she
stopped
say
she
called
the
big
blacksmith
turned
toward
her
with
eagerness
about
a
block
back
she
said
i
saw
a
man
with
hip
disease
you
might
go
and
beat
him
of
one
extravagance
saxon
was
guilty
in
the
course
of
the
brief
engagement
period
a
full
day
wages
she
spent
in
the
purchase
of
half
a
dozen
cabinet
photographs
of
herself
billy
had
insisted
that
life
was
unendurable
could
he
not
look
upon
her
semblance
the
last
thing
when
he
went
to
bed
at
night
and
the
first
thing
when
he
got
up
in
the
morning
in
return
his
photographs
one
conventional
and
one
in
the
stripped
fighting
costume
of
the
ring
ornamented
her
looking
glass
it
was
while
gazing
at
the
latter
that
she
was
reminded
of
her
wonderful
tales
of
the
ancient
saxons
and
of
the
english
coasts
from
the
chest
of
drawers
that
had
crossed
the
plains
she
drew
forth
another
of
her
several
precious
heirlooms
a
of
her
mother
in
which
was
pasted
much
of
the
fugitive
newspaper
verse
of
pioneer
california
days
also
there
were
copies
of
paintings
and
old
wood
engravings
from
the
magazines
of
a
generation
and
more
before
saxon
ran
the
pages
with
familiar
fingers
and
stopped
at
the
picture
she
was
seeking
between
bold
headlands
of
rock
and
under
a
gray
sky
a
dozen
boats
long
and
lean
and
dark
beaked
like
monstrous
birds
were
landing
on
a
beach
of
sand
the
men
in
the
boats
half
naked
and
wore
winged
helmets
in
their
hands
were
swords
and
spears
and
they
were
leaping
into
the
and
wading
ashore
opposed
to
them
contesting
the
landing
were
savages
unlike
indians
however
who
clustered
on
the
beach
or
waded
into
the
water
to
their
knees
the
first
blows
were
being
struck
and
here
and
there
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
wounded
rolled
in
the
surf
one
invader
lay
across
the
gunwale
of
a
boat
the
manner
of
his
death
told
by
the
arrow
that
transfixed
his
breast
in
the
air
leaping
past
him
into
the
water
sword
in
hand
was
billy
there
was
no
mistaking
it
the
striking
blondness
the
face
the
eyes
the
mouth
were
the
same
the
very
expression
on
the
face
was
what
had
been
on
billy
the
day
of
the
picnic
when
he
faced
the
three
wild
irishmen
somewhere
out
of
the
ruck
of
those
warring
races
had
emerged
ancestors
and
hers
was
her
afterthought
as
she
closed
the
book
and
put
it
back
in
the
drawer
and
some
of
those
ancestors
had
made
this
ancient
and
battered
chest
of
drawers
which
had
crossed
the
salt
ocean
and
the
plains
and
been
pierced
by
a
bullet
in
the
fight
with
the
indians
at
little
meadow
almost
it
seemed
she
could
visualize
the
women
who
had
kept
their
pretties
and
their
family
homespun
in
its
drawers
the
women
of
those
wandering
generations
who
were
grandmothers
and
greater
great
grandmothers
of
her
own
mother
well
she
sighed
it
was
a
good
stock
to
be
born
of
a
stock
she
fell
to
wondering
what
her
life
would
have
been
like
had
she
been
born
a
chinese
woman
or
an
italian
woman
like
those
she
saw
or
bareheaded
squat
ungainly
and
swarthy
who
carried
great
loads
of
driftwood
on
their
heads
up
from
the
beach
then
she
laughed
at
her
foolishness
remembered
billy
and
the
cottage
on
pine
street
and
went
to
bed
with
her
mind
filled
for
the
hundredth
time
with
the
details
of
the
furniture
chapter
xiii
our
cattle
were
all
played
out
saxon
was
saying
and
winter
was
so
near
that
we
could
dare
try
to
cross
the
great
american
desert
so
our
train
stopped
in
salt
lake
city
that
winter
the
mormons
had
got
bad
yet
and
they
were
good
to
you
talk
as
though
you
were
there
bert
commented
my
mother
was
saxon
answered
proudly
she
was
nine
years
old
that
they
were
seated
around
the
table
in
the
kitchen
of
the
little
pine
street
cottage
making
a
cold
lunch
of
sandwiches
tamales
and
bottled
beer
it
being
sunday
the
four
were
free
from
work
and
they
had
come
early
to
work
harder
than
on
any
week
day
washing
walls
and
windows
scrubbing
floors
laying
carpets
and
linoleum
hanging
curtains
setting
up
the
stove
putting
the
kitchen
utensils
and
dishes
away
and
placing
the
furniture
go
on
with
the
story
saxon
mary
begged
i
just
dyin
to
hear
and
bert
you
just
shut
up
and
well
that
winter
was
when
del
hancock
showed
up
he
was
kentucky
born
but
he
been
in
the
west
for
years
he
was
a
scout
like
kit
carson
and
he
knew
him
well
many
a
time
kit
carson
and
he
slept
under
the
same
blankets
they
were
together
to
california
and
oregon
with
general
fremont
well
del
hancock
was
passing
on
his
way
through
salt
lake
going
i
do
know
where
to
raise
a
company
of
rocky
mountain
trappers
to
go
after
beaver
some
new
place
he
knew
about
he
was
a
handsome
man
he
wore
his
hair
long
like
in
pictures
and
had
a
silk
sash
around
his
waist
he
learned
to
wear
in
california
from
the
spanish
and
two
revolvers
in
his
belt
any
woman
fall
in
love
with
him
first
sight
well
he
saw
sadie
who
was
my
mother
oldest
sister
and
i
guess
she
looked
good
to
him
for
he
stopped
right
there
in
salt
lake
and
go
a
step
he
was
a
great
indian
fighter
too
and
i
heard
my
aunt
villa
say
when
i
was
a
little
girl
that
he
had
the
blackest
brightest
eyes
and
that
the
way
he
looked
was
like
an
eagle
he
fought
duels
too
the
way
they
did
in
those
days
and
he
was
afraid
of
anything
sadie
was
a
beauty
and
she
flirted
with
him
and
drove
him
crazy
maybe
she
was
sure
of
her
own
mind
i
do
know
but
i
do
know
that
she
did
give
in
as
easy
as
i
did
to
billy
finally
he
could
stand
it
any
more
he
rode
up
that
night
on
horseback
wild
as
could
be
he
said
you
do
promise
to
marry
me
i
shoot
myself
right
back
of
the
corral
and
he
have
done
it
too
and
sadie
knew
it
and
said
she
would
did
they
make
love
fast
in
those
days
oh
i
do
know
mary
sniffed
a
week
after
you
first
laid
eyes
on
billy
you
was
engaged
did
billy
say
he
was
going
to
shoot
himself
back
of
the
laundry
if
you
turned
him
down
i
did
give
him
a
chance
saxon
confessed
anyway
del
hancock
and
aunt
sadie
got
married
next
day
and
they
were
very
happy
afterward
only
she
died
and
after
that
he
was
killed
with
general
custer
and
all
the
rest
by
the
indians
he
was
an
old
man
by
then
but
i
guess
he
got
his
share
of
indians
before
they
got
him
men
like
him
always
died
fighting
and
they
took
their
dead
with
them
i
used
to
know
al
stanley
when
i
was
a
little
girl
he
was
a
gambler
but
he
was
game
a
railroad
man
shot
him
in
the
back
when
he
was
sitting
at
a
table
that
shot
killed
him
too
he
died
in
about
two
seconds
but
before
he
died
pulled
his
gun
and
put
three
bullets
into
the
man
that
killed
i
do
like
fightin
mary
protested
it
makes
me
nervous
bert
gives
me
the
willies
the
way

from

i
goin
to
see
that
them
curtains
tell
the
you

bert
suggested
you
close
to
the
railroad
yards
and
it
only
two
blocks
to
a
not
on
your
life
i
ai
marryin
saxon
to
take
in
lodgers
if
i
take
care
of
her
d

what
i
do
go
down
to
long
wharf
say
goes
nothin
an
jump
into
the
bay
with
a
stone
tied
to
my
neck
ai
i
right
saxon
it
was
contrary
to
her
prudent
judgment
but
it
fanned
her
pride
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
lover
neck
and
said
ere
she
kissed
him
you
the
boss
billy
what
you
say
goes
and
always
will
listen
to
that
bert
gibed
to
mary
that
the
stuff
saxon
onto
her
i
guess
we
talk
things
over
together
first
before
ever
i
do
anything
billy
was
saying
to
saxon
listen
to
that
mary
triumphed
you
bet
the
man
that
marries
have
to
talk
things
over
billy
only
givin
her
hot
air
bert
plagued
they
all
do
it
before
they
mary
sniffed
contemptuously
i
bet
saxon
leads
him
around
by
the
nose
and
i
goin
to
say
loud
an
strong
that
i
lead
the
man
around
by
the
nose
that
marries
not
if
you
love
him
saxon
interposed
all
the
more
reason
mary
pursued
bert
assumed
an
expression
and
attitude
of
mournful
dejection
now
you
see
why
me
an
mary
do
get
married
he
said
i
some
big
indian
myself
an
i
be
everlastingly
jiggerooed
if
i
put
up
for
a
wigwam
i
ca
be
boss
and
i
no
squaw
mary
retaliated
an
i
would
marry
a
big
buck
indian
if
all
the
rest
of
the
men
in
the
world
was
well
this
big
buck
indian
ai
asked
you
he
knows
what
he
get
if
he
and
after
that
maybe
he
think
twice
before
he
does
ask
saxon
intent
on
diverting
the
conversation
into
pleasanter
channels
clapped
her
hands
as
if
with
sudden
recollection
oh
i
forgot
i
want
to
show
you
from
her
purse
she
drew
a
slender
ring
of
plain
gold
and
passed
it
around
my
mother
wedding
ring
i
worn
it
around
my
neck
always
like
a
locket
i
cried
for
it
so
in
the
orphan
asylum
that
the
matron
gave
it
back
for
me
to
wear
and
now
just
to
think
after
next
tuesday
i
be
wearing
it
on
my
finger
look
billy
see
the
engraving
on
the
c
to
d
he
read
carlton
to
daisy
carlton
was
my
father
first
name
and
now
billy
you
got
to
get
it
engraved
for
you
and
mary
was
all
eagerness
and
delight
oh
it
fine
she
cried
w
to
s
billy
considered
a
moment
no
that
would
be
right
because
i
not
giving
it
to
i
tell
you
what
saxon
said
w
and
billy
shook
his
head
s
and
w
because
you
come
first
with
if
i
come
first
with
you
you
come
first
with
us
billy
dear
i
insist
on
w
and
you
see
mary
said
to
bert
having
her
own
way
and
leading
him
by
the
nose
saxon
acknowledged
the
sting
anyway
you
want
billy
she
surrendered
his
arms
tightened
about
her
we
talk
it
over
first
i
chapter
xiv
sarah
was
conservative
worse
she
had
crystallized
at
the
end
of
her
with
the
coming
of
her
first
child
after
that
she
was
as
set
in
her
ways
as
plaster
in
a
mold
her
mold
was
the
prejudices
and
notions
of
her
girlhood
and
the
house
she
lived
in
so
habitual
was
she
that
any
change
in
the
customary
round
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
revolution
tom
had
gone
through
many
of
these
revolutions
three
of
them
when
he
moved
house
then
his
stamina
broke
and
he
never
moved
house
again
so
it
was
that
saxon
had
held
back
the
announcement
of
her
approaching
marriage
until
it
was
unavoidable
she
expected
a
scene
and
she
got
it
a
prizefighter
a
hoodlum
a
sarah
sneered
after
she
had
exhausted
herself
of
all
calamitous
forecasts
of
her
own
future
and
the
future
of
her
children
in
the
absence
of
saxon
weekly
four
dollars
and
a
half
i
do
know
what
your
mother
thought
if
she
lived
to
see
the
day
when
you
took
up
with
a
tough
like
bill
roberts
bill
why
your
mother
was
too
refined
to
associate
with
a
man
that
was
called
bill
and
all
i
can
say
is
you
can
say
to
silk
stockings
and
your
three
pair
of
shoes
it
wo
be
long
before
you
think
yourself
lucky
to
go
sloppin
around
in
congress
gaiters
and
cotton
stockin
two
pair
for
a
oh
i
not
afraid
of
billy
not
being
able
to
keep
me
in
all
kinds
of
shoes
saxon
retorted
with
a
proud
toss
of
her
head
you
do
know
what
you
talkin
sarah
paused
to
laugh
in
mirthless
discordance
watch
for
the
babies
to
come
they
come
faster
than
wages
raise
these
but
we
not
going
to
have
any
babies
that
is
at
first
not
until
after
the
furniture
is
all
paid
for
wise
in
your
generation
eh
in
my
days
girls
were
more
modest
than
to
know
anything
about
disgraceful
as
babies
saxon
queried
with
a
touch
of
gentle
malice
yes
as
the
first
i
knew
that
babies
were
disgraceful
why
sarah
you
with
your
five
how
disgraceful
you
have
been
billy
and
i
have
decided
not
to
be
half
as
disgraceful
we
only
going
to
have
two
a
boy
and
a
tom
chuckled
but
held
the
peace
by
hiding
his
face
in
his
coffee
cup
sarah
though
checked
by
this
flank
attack
was
herself
an
old
hand
in
the
art
so
temporary
was
the
setback
that
she
scarcely
paused
ere
hurling
her
assault
from
a
new
angle
an
marryin
so
quick
all
of
a
sudden
eh
if
that
ai
suspicious
nothin
is
i
do
know
what
young
women
comin
to
they
decent
i
tell
you
they
ai
decent
that
what
comes
of
sunday
dancin
an
all
the
rest
young
women
nowadays
are
like
a
lot
of
animals
such
fast
an
looseness
i
never
saw
saxon
was
white
with
anger
but
while
sarah
wandered
on
in
her
diatribe
tom
managed
to
wink
privily
and
prodigiously
at
his
sister
and
to
implore
her
to
help
in
keeping
the
peace
it
all
right
kid
sister
he
comforted
saxon
when
they
were
alone
there
no
use
talkin
to
sarah
bill
roberts
is
a
good
boy
i
know
a
lot
about
him
it
does
you
proud
to
get
him
for
a
husband
you
bound
to
be
happy
with
him
his
voice
sank
and
his
face
seemed
suddenly
to
be
very
old
and
tired
as
he
went
on
anxiously
take
warning
from
sarah
do
nag
whatever
you
do
do
nag
do
give
him
a
line
of
chin
kind
of
let
him
talk
once
in
a
while
men
have
some
horse
sense
though
sarah
do
know
it
why
sarah
actually
loves
me
though
she
do
make
a
noise
like
it
the
thing
for
you
is
to
love
your
husband
and
by
thunder
to
make
a
noise
of
lovin
him
too
and
then
you
can
kid
him
into
doing
anything
you
want
let
him
have
his
way
once
in
a
while
and
he
let
you
have
yourn
but
you
just
go
on
him
and
leanin
on
his
judgement

scared
from
goin
wrong
what
of
sarah
but
i
sooner

it
tom
saxon
nodded
smiling
through
the
tears
his
sympathy
had
brought
into
her
eyes
and
on
top
of
it
i
going
to
do
something
else

going
to
make
billy

some
of
the
things

want
he

them
because

you
you
got
the
right
idea
saxon
stick
with
it
an
you
win
later
when
she
had
put
on
her
hat
to
start
for
the
laundry
she
found
tom
waiting
for
her
at
the
corner
an
saxon
he
said
hastily
and
haltingly
you
wo
take
anything
i
said
you
know
about
sarah
as
bein
in
any
way
disloyal
to
her
she
a
good
woman
an
faithful
an
her
life
ai
so
easy
by
a
long
shot
i
bite
out
my
tongue
before
i
say
anything
against

i
guess
all
folks
have
their
troubles
it
hell
to
be
poor
ai
it
you

awful
good
to
me
tom

i
wo

wedding
present
her
brother
ventured
apologetically
sarah
wo
hear
of
it
says
we
did
get
none
from
my
folks
when
we
got
married
but
i
got
something
for

a
surprise

when
you

just
happened
to
think
of
it
an
i
wrote

for
it
for
you
an
by
thunder
he
sent

i
did
know
but
maybe
he
sold
it
he
did
sell
the
silver
spurs
he
needed
the
money
i
guess
but
the
other
i
had
it
sent
to
the
shop
so
as
not
to
bother
sarah
an
i
sneaked
it
in
last
night
an
hid
it
in
the
oh
it

something
of
my
father

what
is
it

army
the
one

in
the
back
way

washing
in
the
kitchen
and
she
wo
begin
hanging
out
for
an
i
spoke
to
sarah
about
lettin
you
take
the
old
chest
of
drawers
that
was
your
mother
tom
whispered
as
they
stole
along
the
narrow
alley
between
the
houses
only
she
got
on
her
high
horse
said
that
daisy
was
as
much
my
mother
as
yourn
even
if
we
did
have
different
fathers
and
that
the
chest
had
always
belonged
in
daisy
family
and
not
captain
kit
an
that
it
was
mine
an
what
was
mine
she
had
some
it
all
right
saxon
reassured
him
she
sold
it
to
me
last
night
she
was
waiting
up
for
me
when
i
got
home
with
fire
in
her
yep
she
was
on
the
warpath
all
day
after
i
mentioned
it
how
much
did
you
give
her
for
it
six
robbery
it
ai
worth
it
tom
groaned
it
all
cracked
at
one
end
and
as
old
as
the
i
have
given
ten
dollars
for
it
i
have
given
anything
for
it
tom
it
was
mother
you
know
i
remember
it
in
her
room
when
she
was
still
in
the
woodshed
tom
resurrected
the
hidden
treasure
and
took
off
the
wrapping
paper
appeared
a
rusty
saber
of
the
heavy
type
carried
by
cavalry
officers
in
civil
war
days
it
was
attached
to
a
sash
of
crimson
silk
from
which
hung
heavy
silk
tassels
saxon
almost
seized
it
from
her
brother
in
her
eagerness
she
drew
forth
the
blade
and
pressed
her
lips
to
the
steel
it
was
her
last
day
at
the
laundry
she
was
to
quit
work
that
evening
for
good
and
the
next
afternoon
at
five
she
and
billy
were
to
go
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
be
married
bert
and
mary
were
to
be
the
witnesses
and
after
that
the
four
were
to
go
to
a
private
room
in
barnum
restaurant
for
the
wedding
supper
that
over
bert
and
mary
would
proceed
to
a
dance
at
myrtle
hall
while
billy
and
saxon
would
take
the
eighth
street
car
to
seventh
and
pine
honeymoons
are
infrequent
in
the
working
class
the
next
morning
billy
must
be
at
the
stable
at
his
regular
hour
to
drive
his
team
out
all
the
women
in
the
fancy
starch
room
knew
it
was
saxon
last
day
many
exulted
for
her
and
not
a
few
were
envious
of
her
in
that
she
had
won
a
husband
and
to
freedom
from
the
suffocating
slavery
of
the
ironing
board
much
of
bantering
she
endured
such
was
the
fate
of
every
girl
who
married
out
of
the
fancy
starch
room
but
saxon
was
too
happy
to
be
hurt
by
the
teasing
a
great
deal
of
which
was
gross
but
all
of
which
was
in
the
steam
that
arose
from
under
her
iron
and
on
the
surfaces
of
the
dainty
lawns
and
muslins
that
flew
under
her
hands
she
kept
visioning
herself
in
the
pine
street
cottage
and
steadily
she
hummed
under
her
breath
her
paraphrase
of
the
latest
popular
song
and
when
i
work
and
when
i
work
i
always
work
for
by
three
in
the
afternoon
the
strain
of
the
in
the
humid
heated
room
grew
tense
elderly
women
gasped
and
sighed
the
color
went
out
of
the
cheeks
of
the
young
women
their
faces
became
drawn
and
dark
circles
formed
under
their
eyes
but
all
held
on
with
weary
unabated
speed
the
tireless
vigilant
forewoman
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
incipient
hysteria
and
once
led
a
young
thing
out
of
the
place
in
time
to
prevent
a
collapse
saxon
was
startled
by
the
wildest
scream
of
terror
she
had
ever
heard
the
tense
thread
of
human
resolution
snapped
wills
and
nerves
broke
down
and
a
hundred
women
suspended
their
irons
or
dropped
them
it
was
mary
who
had
screamed
so
terribly
and
saxon
saw
a
strange
black
animal
flapping
great
wings
and
nestling
on
mary
shoulder
with
the
scream
mary
crouched
down
and
the
strange
creature
darting
into
the
air
fluttered
full
into
the
startled
face
of
a
woman
at
the
next
board
this
woman
promptly
screamed
and
fainted
into
the
air
again
the
flying
thing
darted
hither
and
thither
while
the
shrieking
shrinking
women
threw
up
their
arms
tried
to
run
away
along
the
aisles
or
cowered
under
their
ironing
boards
it
only
a
bat
the
forewoman
shouted
she
was
furious
ai
you
ever
seen
a
bat
it
wo
eat
you
but
they
were
ghetto
people
and
were
not
to
be
quieted
some
woman
who
could
not
see
the
cause
of
the
uproar
out
of
her
overwrought
apprehension
raised
the
cry
of
fire
and
precipitated
the
panic
rush
for
the
doors
all
of
them
were
screaming
the
stupid
high
note
of
terror
drowning
the
forewoman
voice
saxon
had
been
merely
startled
at
first
but
the
screaming
panic
broke
her
grip
on
herself
and
swept
her
away
though
she
did
not
scream
she
fled
with
the
rest
when
this
horde
of
crazed
women
debouched
on
the
next
department
those
who
worked
there
joined
in
the
stampede
to
escape
from
they
knew
not
what
danger
in
ten
minutes
the
laundry
was
deserted
save
for
a
few
men
wandering
about
with
hand
grenades
in
futile
search
for
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
the
forewoman
was
stout
but
indomitable
swept
along
half
the
length
of
an
aisle
by
the
women
she
had
broken
her
way
back
through
the
rout
and
quickly
caught
the
visitant
in
a
clothes
basket
maybe
i
do
know
what
god
looks
like
but
take
it
from
me
i
seen
a
tintype
of
the
devil
mary
gurgled
emotionally
fluttering
back
and
forth
between
laughter
and
tears
but
saxon
was
angry
with
herself
for
she
had
been
as
frightened
as
the
rest
in
that
wild
flight
for
we
a
lot
of
fools
she
said
it
was
only
a
bat
i
heard
about
them
they
live
in
the
country
they
would
hurt
a
fly
they
ca
see
in
the
daytime
that
was
what
was
the
matter
with
this
one
it
was
only
a
huh
you
ca
string
me
mary
replied
it
was
the
she
sobbed
a
moment
and
then
laughed
hysterically
again
did
you
see
bergstrom
faint
and
it
only
touched
her
in
the
face
why
it
was
on
my
shoulder
and
touching
my
bare
neck
like
the
hand
of
a
corpse
and
i
did
she
laughed
again
i
guess
maybe
i
was
too
scared
to
come
on
back
saxon
urged
we
lost
half
an
not
me
i
goin
home
after
that
if
they
fire
me
i
could
iron
for
sour
apples
now
i
that
one
woman
had
broken
a
leg
another
an
arm
and
a
number
nursed
milder
bruises
and
bruises
no
bullying
nor
entreating
of
the
forewoman
could
persuade
the
women
to
return
to
work
they
were
too
upset
and
nervous
and
only
here
and
there
could
one
be
found
brave
enough
to
the
building
for
the
hats
and
lunch
baskets
of
the
others
saxon
was
one
of
the
handful
that
returned
and
worked
till
six

expensive

wine

the
management
supplied

he
drained
the
glass
suddenly
and
collapsed
in
his
chair
blinking
his
eyes
across
at
the
wedded
couple
while
tears
trickled
unheeded
down
his
cheeks

with
soothing
strokes

up
bert
everything

a
hot
he
stood
up
his
hand
on
his
glass
his
clear
blue
eyes
under
the
dark
brows
and
framed
by
the
dark
lashes
seemed
a
deeper
blue
and
accentuated
the
blondness
of
hair
and
skin
the
smooth
cheeks
were
rosy
not
with
wine
for
it
was
only
his
second
glass
but
with
health
and
joy
saxon
looking
up
at
him
thrilled
with
pride
in
him
he
was
so
so
strong
so
handsome
so
her
and
she
was
aware
of
pride
in
herself

i

when
i
furnished
it
eh
i
never
thought
it
of
you
billy
mary
exclaimed
you
every
bit
as
raw
as
bert
but
just
the
same
there
was
a
rush
of
moisture
to
her
eyes
her
voice
faltered
and
broke
she
smiled
through
her
tears
at
them
then
turned
to
look
at
bert
who
put
his
arm
around
her
and
gathered
her
on
to
his
knees
when
they
left
the
restaurant
the
four
walked
to
eighth
and
broadway
where
they
stopped
beside
the
electric
car
bert
and
billy
were
awkward
and
silent
oppressed
by
a
strange
aloofness
but
mary
embraced
saxon
with
fond
anxiousness
it
all
right
dear
mary
whispered
do
be
scared
it
all
right
think
of
all
the
other
women
in
the
the
conductor
clanged
the
gong
and
the
two
couples
separated
in
a
sudden
hubbub
of
farewell
oh
you
mohegan
bert
called
after
as
the
car
got
under
way
oh
you
minnehaha
remember
what
i
said
was
mary
parting
to
saxon
the
car
stopped
at
seventh
and
pine
the
terminus
of
the
line
it
was
only
a
little
over
two
blocks
to
the
cottage
on
the
front
steps
billy
took
the
key
from
his
pocket
funny
is
it
he
said
as
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
you
an
me
just
you
an
while
he
lighted
the
lamp
in
the
parlor
saxon
was
taking
off
her
hat
he
went
into
the
bedroom
and
lighted
the
lamp
there
then
turned
back
and
stood
in
the
doorway
saxon
still
unaccountably
fumbling
with
her
hatpins
stole
a
glance
at
him
he
held
out
his
arms
now
he
said
she
came
to
him
and
in
his
arms
he
could
feel
her
trembling
book
ii
chapter
i
the
first
evening
after
the
marriage
night
saxon
met
billy
at
the
door
as
he
came
up
the
front
steps
after
their
embrace
and
as
they
crossed
the
parlor
hand
in
hand
toward
the
kitchen
he
filled
his
lungs
through
his
nostrils
with
audible
satisfaction
my
but
this
house
smells
good
saxon
it
ai
the
coffee
i
can
smell
that
too
it
the
whole
house
it
smells
well
it
just
smells
good
to
me
that
he
washed
and
dried
himself
at
the
sink
while
she
heated
the
frying
pan
on
the
front
hole
of
the
stove
with
the
lid
off
as
he
wiped
his
hands
he
watched
her
keenly
and
cried
out
with
approbation
as
she
dropped
the
steak
in
the
frying
pan
where
you
learn
to
cook
steak
on
a
dry
hot
pan
it
the
only
way
but
darn
few
women
seem
to
know
about
as
she
took
the
cover
off
a
second
frying
pan
and
stirred
the
savory
contents
with
a
kitchen
knife
he
came
behind
her
passed
his
arms
under
her
with
hands
upon
her
breasts
and
bent
his
head
over
her
shoulder
till
cheek
touched
cheek
fried
potatoes
with
onions
like
mother
used
to
make
me
for
them
do
they
smell
good
though
the
pressure
of
his
hands
relaxed
and
his
cheek
slid
caressingly
past
hers
as
he
started
to
release
her
then
his
hands
closed
down
again
she
felt
his
lips
on
her
hair
and
heard
his
advertised
inhalation
of
delight
do
you
smell
good
yourself
though
i
never
understood
what
they
meant
when
they
said
a
girl
was
sweet
i
know
now
and
the
sweetest
i
ever
his
joy
was
boundless
when
he
returned
from
combing
his
hair
in
the
bedroom
and
sat
down
at
the
small
table
opposite
her
he
paused
with
knife
and
fork
in
hand
say
bein
married
is
a
whole
lot
more
than
it
cracked
up
to
be
by
most
married
folks
honest
to
god
saxon
we
can
show
a
few
we
can
give
cards
and
spades
an
little
casino
an
win
out
on
big
casino
and
the
aces
i
got
but
one
kick
the
instant
apprehension
in
her
eyes
provoked
a
chuckle
from
him
an
that
is
that
we
did
get
married
quick
enough
just
think
lost
a
whole
week
of
her
eyes
shone
with
gratitude
and
happiness
and
in
her
heart
she
solemnly
pledged
herself
that
never
in
all
their
married
life
would
it
be
otherwise
supper
finished
she
cleared
the
table
and
began
washing
the
dishes
at
the
sink
when
he
evinced
the
intention
of
wiping
them
she
caught
him
by
the
lapels
of
the
coat
and
backed
him
into
a
chair
you
sit
right
there
if
you
know
what
good
for
you
now
be
good
and
mind
what
i
say
also
you
will
smoke
a
no
you
not
going
to
watch
me
there
the
morning
paper
beside
you
and
if
you
do
hurry
to
read
it
i
be
through
these
dishes
before
as
he
smoked
and
read
she
continually
glanced
across
at
him
from
her
work
one
thing
more
she
thought
slippers
and
then
the
picture
of
comfort
and
content
would
be
complete
several
minutes
later
billy
put
the
paper
aside
with
a
sigh
it
no
use
he
complained
i
ca
what
the
matter
she
teased
eyes
weak
nope
they
sore
and
there
only
one
thing
to
do
any
good
that
lookin
at
all
right
then
baby
billy
i
be
through
in
a
when
she
had
washed
the
dish
towel
and
scalded
out
the
sink
she
took
off
her
kitchen
apron
came
to
him
and
kissed
first
one
eye
and
then
the
other
how
are
they
now
cured
they
feel
some
better
she
repeated
the
treatment
and
now
still
and
now
almost
after
he
had
adjudged
them
well
he
ouched
and
informed
her
that
there
was
still
some
hurt
in
the
right
eye
in
the
course
of
treating
it
she
cried
out
as
in
pain
billy
was
all
alarm
what
is
it
what
hurt
you
my
eyes
they
hurting
like
and
billy
became
physician
for
a
while
and
she
the
patient
when
the
cure
was
accomplished
she
led
him
into
the
parlor
where
by
the
open
window
they
succeeded
in
occupying
the
same
morris
chair
it
was
the
most
expensive
comfort
in
the
house
it
had
cost
seven
dollars
and
a
half
and
though
it
was
grander
than
anything
she
had
dreamed
of
possessing
the
extravagance
of
it
had
worried
her
in
a
way
all
day
the
salt
chill
of
the
air
that
is
the
blessing
of
all
the
bay
cities
after
the
sun
goes
down
crept
in
about
them
they
heard
the
switch
engines
puffing
in
the
railroad
yards
and
the
rumbling
thunder
of
the
seventh
street
local
slowing
down
in
its
run
from
the
mole
to
stop
at
west
oakland
station
from
the
street
came
the
noise
of
children
playing
in
the
summer
night
and
from
the
steps
of
the
house
next
door
the
low
voices
of
gossiping
housewives
can
you
beat
it
billy
murmured
when
i
think
of
that
furnished
room
of
mine
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
what
i
was
all
the
time
but
there
one
satisfaction
if
i
changed
it
sooner
i
would
you
you
see
i
did
know
you
existed
only
until
a
couple
of
weeks
his
hand
crept
along
her
bare
forearm
and
up
and
partly
under
the
your
skin
so
cool
he
said
it
ai
cold
it
cool
it
feels
good
to
the
pretty
soon
you
be
calling
me
your
baby
she
laughed
and
your
voice
is
cool
he
went
on
it
gives
me
the
feeling
just
as
your
hand
does
when
you
rest
it
on
my
forehead
it
funny
i
explain
it
but
your
voice
just
goes
all
through
me
cool
and
fine
it
like
a
wind
of
coolness
just
right
it
like
the
first
of
the
settin
in
in
the
afternoon
after
a
scorchin
hot
morning
an
sometimes
when
you
talk
low
it
sounds
round
and
sweet
like
the
in
the
macdonough
theater
orchestra
and
it
never
goes
high
up
or
sharp
or
squeaky
or
scratchy
like
some
women
voices
when
mad
or
fresh
or
excited
till
they
remind
me
of
a
bum
phonograph
record
why
your
voice
it
just
goes
through
me
till
i
all
trembling
like
with
the
everlastin
cool
of
it
it
it
straight
delicious
i
guess
angels
in
heaven
if
they
is
any
must
have
voices
like
after
a
few
minutes
in
which
so
inexpressible
was
her
happiness
that
she
could
only
pass
her
hand
through
his
hair
and
cling
to
him
he
broke
out
again
i
tell
you
what
you
remind
me
of
did
you
ever
see
a
thoroughbred
mare
all
shinin
in
the
sun
with
hair
like
satin
an
skin
so
thin
tender
that
the
least
touch
of
the
whip
leaves
a
mark
all
fine
nerves
an
delicate
an
sensitive
that
kill
the
toughest
bronco
when
it
comes
to
endurance
an
that
can
strain
a
tendon
in
a
flash
or
catch
without
a
blanket
for
a
night
i
wanta
tell
you
they
many
beautifuler
sights
in
this
world
an
they
that
sensitive
an
delicate
you
got
ta
handle
up
glass
with
care
well
that
what
you
remind
me
of
and
i
goin
to
make
it
my
job
to
see
you
get
handled
an
gentled
in
the
same
way
as
different
from
other
women
as
that
kind
of
a
mare
is
from
scrub
mares
you
a
thoroughbred
you
an
spirited
an
your
lines
say
d
know
you
got
some
figure
well
you
have
talk
about
annette
kellerman
you
can
give
her
cards
and
spades
she
australian
an
you
american
only
your
figure
ai
you
different
nifty
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
other
women
ai
built
like
you
you
belong
in
some
other
country
you
frenchy
that
what
built
like
a
french
woman
an
more
than
that
the
way
you
walk
move
stand
up
or
sit
down
or
do
do
and
he
who
had
never
been
out
of
california
or
for
that
matter
had
never
slept
a
night
away
from
his
birthtown
of
oakland
was
right
in
his
judgment
she
was
a
flower
of
stock
a
rarity
in
the
exceptional
smallness
and
fineness
of
hand
and
foot
and
bone
and
grace
of
flesh
and
carriage
some
across
the
face
of
time
to
the
foraying
that
had
intermingled
with
the
sturdy
saxon
breed
and
in
the
way
you
carry
your
clothes
they
belong
to
you
they
seem
just
as
much
part
of
you
as
the
cool
of
your
voice
and
skin
always
all
right
an
could
be
better
an
you
know
a
fellow
kind
of
likes
to
be
seen
taggin
around
with
a
woman
like
you
that
wears
her
clothes
like
a
dream
an
hear
the
other
fellows
say
bill
new
skirt
she
a
peach
ai
she
would
i
like
to
win
her
though
and
all
that
sort
of
and
saxon
her
cheek
pressed
to
his
knew
that
she
was
paid
in
full
for
all
her
midnight
sewings
and
the
torturing
hours
of
drowsy
stitching
when
her
head
nodded
with
the
weariness
of
the
day
toil
while
she
recreated
for
herself
filched
ideas
from
the
dainty
garments
that
had
steamed
under
her
passing
iron
say
saxon
i
got
a
new
name
for
you
you
my
tonic
kid
that
what
you
are
the
tonic
and
you
never
get
tired
of
me
she
queried
tired
why
we
was
made
for
each
is
it
wonderful
our
meeting
billy
we
might
never
have
met
it
was
just
by
accident
that
we
we
was
born
lucky
he
proclaimed
that
a
maybe
it
was
more
than
luck
she
ventured
sure
it
just
had
to
be
it
was
fate
nothing
could
us
they
sat
on
in
a
silence
that
was
quick
with
unuttered
love
till
she
felt
him
slowly
draw
her
more
closely
and
his
lips
come
near
to
her
ear
as
they
whispered
what
do
you
say
we
go
to
bed
many
evenings
they
spent
like
this
varied
with
an
occasional
dance
with
trips
to
the
orpheum
and
to
bell
theater
or
to
the
moving
picture
shows
or
to
the
friday
night
band
concerts
in
city
hall
park
often
on
sunday
she
prepared
a
lunch
and
he
drove
her
out
into
the
hills
behind
prince
and
king
whom
billy
employer
was
still
glad
to
have
him
exercise
each
morning
saxon
was
called
by
the
alarm
clock
the
first
morning
he
had
insisted
upon
getting
up
with
her
and
building
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
stove
she
gave
in
the
first
morning
but
after
that
she
laid
the
fire
in
the
evening
so
that
all
that
was
required
was
the
touching
of
a
match
to
it
and
in
bed
she
compelled
him
to
remain
for
a
last
little
doze
ere
she
called
him
for
breakfast
for
the
first
several
weeks
she
prepared
his
lunch
for
him
then
for
a
week
he
came
down
to
dinner
after
that
he
was
compelled
to
take
his
lunch
with
him
it
depended
on
how
far
distant
the
teaming
was
done
you
not
starting
right
with
a
man
mary
cautioned
you
wait
on
him
hand
and
foot
you
spoil
him
if
you
do
watch
out
it
him
that
ought
to
be
waitin
on
he
the
saxon
replied
he
works
harder
than
i
and
i
got
more
time
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
time
to
burn
besides
i
want
to
wait
on
him
because
i
love
to
and
because
well
anyway
i
want
chapter
ii
despite
the
fastidiousness
of
her
housekeeping
saxon
once
she
had
systematized
it
found
time
and
to
spare
on
her
hands
especially
during
the
periods
in
which
her
husband
carried
his
lunch
and
there
was
no
midday
meal
to
prepare
she
had
a
number
of
hours
each
day
to
herself
trained
for
years
to
the
routine
of
factory
and
laundry
work
she
could
not
abide
this
unaccustomed
idleness
she
could
not
bear
to
sit
and
do
nothing
while
she
could
not
pay
calls
on
her
girlhood
friends
for
they
still
worked
in
factory
and
laundry
nor
was
she
acquainted
with
the
wives
of
the
neighborhood
save
for
one
strange
old
woman
who
lived
in
the
house
next
door
and
with
whom
saxon
had
exchanged
snatches
of
conversation
over
the
backyard
division
fence
one
diversion
of
which
saxon
took
advantage
was
free
and
unlimited
baths
in
the
orphan
asylum
and
in
sarah
house
she
had
been
used
to
but
one
bath
a
week
as
she
grew
to
womanhood
she
had
attempted
more
frequent
baths
but
the
effort
proved
disastrous
arousing
first
sarah
derision
and
next
her
wrath
sarah
had
crystallized
in
the
era
of
the
weekly
saturday
night
bath
and
any
increase
in
this
cleansing
function
was
regarded
by
her
as
putting
on
airs
and
as
an
insinuation
against
her
own
cleanliness
also
it
was
an
extravagant
misuse
of
fuel
and
occasioned
extra
towels
in
the
family
wash
but
now
in
house
with
her
own
stove
her
own
tub
and
towels
and
soap
and
no
one
to
say
her
nay
saxon
was
guilty
of
a
daily
orgy
true
it
was
only
a
common
washtub
that
she
placed
on
the
kitchen
floor
and
filled
by
hand
but
it
was
a
luxury
that
had
taken
her
years
to
achieve
it
was
from
the
strange
woman
next
door
that
saxon
received
a
hint
dropped
in
casual
conversation
of
what
proved
the
culminating
joy
of
bathing
a
simple
thing
a
few
drops
of
druggist
ammonia
in
the
water
but
saxon
had
never
heard
of
it
before
she
was
destined
to
learn
much
from
the
strange
woman
the
acquaintance
had
begun
one
day
when
saxon
in
the
back
yard
was
hanging
out
a
couple
of
corset
covers
and
several
pieces
of
her
finest
undergarments
the
woman
leaning
on
the
rail
of
her
back
porch
had
caught
her
eye
and
nodded
as
it
seemed
to
saxon
half
to
her
and
half
to
the
underlinen
on
the
line
you
newly
married
are
you
the
woman
asked
i
higgins
i
prefer
my
first
name
which
is
and
i
roberts
saxon
replied
thrilling
to
the
newness
of
the
designation
on
her
tongue
my
first
name
is
strange
name
for
a
yankee
woman
the
other
commented
oh
but
i
not
yankee
saxon
exclaimed
i
la
la
laughed
mercedes
higgins
i
forgot
i
was
in
america
in
other
lands
all
americans
are
called
yankees
it
is
true
that
you
are
newly
married
saxon
nodded
with
a
happy
sigh
mercedes
sighed
too
oh
you
happy
soft
beautiful
young
thing
i
could
envy
you
to
hatred
you
with
all
the
ripe
to
be
twisted
about
your
pretty
little
fingers
and
you
do
realize
your
fortune
no
one
does
until
it
too
saxon
was
puzzled
and
disturbed
though
she
answered
readily
oh
but
i
do
know
how
lucky
i
am
i
have
the
finest
man
in
the
mercedes
higgins
sighed
again
and
changed
the
subject
she
nodded
her
head
at
the
garments
i
see
you
like
pretty
things
it
is
good
judgment
for
a
young
woman
they
the
bait
for
men
half
the
weapons
in
the
battle
they
win
men
and
they
hold
men
she
broke
off
to
demand
almost
fiercely
and
you
you
would
keep
your
husband
always
always
if
you
can
i
intend
to
i
will
make
him
love
me
always
and
saxon
ceased
troubled
and
surprised
that
she
should
be
so
intimate
with
a
stranger
is
a
queer
thing
this
love
of
men
mercedes
said
and
a
failing
of
all
women
is
it
to
believe
they
know
men
like
books
and
with
breaking
hearts
die
they
do
most
women
out
of
their
ignorance
of
men
and
still
foolishly
believing
they
know
all
about
them
oh
la
la
the
little
fools
and
so
you
say
little
woman
that
you
will
make
your
man
love
you
always
and
always
and
so
they
all
say
it
knowing
men
and
the
queerness
of
men
love
the
way
they
think
they
do
easier
it
is
to
win
the
capital
prize
in
the
little
louisiana
but
the
little
women
never
know
it
until
too
late
but
you
you
have
begun
well
stay
by
your
pretties
and
your
looks
was
so
you
won
your
man
so
you
hold
him
but
that
is
not
all
some
time
i
will
talk
with
you
and
tell
what
few
women
trouble
to
know
what
few
women
ever
come
to
saxon
is
a
strong
handsome
name
for
a
woman
but
you
look
it
oh
i
watched
you
french
you
are
with
a
frenchiness
beyond
dispute
tell
roberts
i
congratulate
him
on
his
good
she
paused
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
her
kitchen
door
and
come
and
see
me
some
time
you
will
never
be
sorry
i
can
teach
you
much
come
in
the
afternoon
my
man
is
night
watchman
in
the
yards
and
sleeps
of
mornings
he
sleeping
saxon
went
into
the
house
puzzling
and
pondering
anything
but
ordinary
was
this
lean
woman
with
the
face
withered
as
if
scorched
in
great
heats
and
the
eyes
large
and
black
that
flashed
and
flamed
with
advertisement
of
an
unquenched
inner
conflagration
old
she
was
saxon
caught
herself
debating
anywhere
between
fifty
and
seventy
and
her
hair
which
had
once
been
blackest
black
was
streaked
plentifully
with
gray
especially
noteworthy
to
saxon
was
her
speech
good
english
it
was
better
than
that
to
which
saxon
was
accustomed
yet
the
woman
was
not
american
on
the
other
hand
she
had
no
perceptible
accent
rather
were
her
words
touched
by
a
foreignness
so
elusive
that
saxon
could
not
analyze
nor
place
it
uh
huh
billy
said
when
she
had
told
him
that
evening
of
the
event
so
she
higgins
he
a
watchman
he
got
only
one
arm
old
higgins
an
her
a
funny
bunch
the
two
of
them
the
people
scared
of
her
some
of
the
dagoes
an
some
of
the
old
irish
dames
thinks
she
a
witch
wo
have
a
thing
to
do
with
her
bert
was
tellin
me
about
it
why

d
know
some
of
believe
if
she
was
to
get
mad
at
or
did
like
their
mugs
or
anything
that
all
she
got
to
do
is
look
at
an
they
curl
up
their
toes
an
croak
one
of
the
fellows
that
works
at
the
stable

lives
around
the
corner
on
fifth
he
says
she
oh

her
new
acquaintance
she
may
be
crazy
but
she
says
the
same
thing
you
always
saying
she
says
my
form
is
not
american
but
then
i
take
my
hat
off
to
her
billy
responded

wheels
in
her
head

a
wise
and
she
speaks

english
billy
like

ai

she
would
you
up
the
way
she
she
told
me
to
congratulate
you
on
your
good
taste
in
marrying
me
saxon
laughed
she
did
eh
then
give
her
my
love
me
for
her
because
she
knows
a
good
thing
when
she
sees
it
an
she
ought
to
be
congratulating
you
on
your
good
taste
in
it
was
on
another
day
that
mercedes
higgins
nodded
half
to
saxon
and
half
to
the
dainty
women
things
saxon
was
hanging
on
the
line
i
been
worrying
over
your
washing

her
greeting

quickly
mercedes
sneered

business

it
stupid

long
time

true
sacrament

recipe
for

and
her
head
was
filled
with
a
minutiae
of
instruction
in
the
art
of
fine
washing
further
she
was
fascinated
and
excited
by
all
the
newness
and
strangeness
of
the
withered
old
woman
who
blew
upon
her
the
breath
of
wider
lands
and
seas
beyond
the
horizon
you
are
spanish
saxon
ventured
no
and
yes
and
neither
and
more
my
father
was
irish
my
mother
is
after
her
i
took
in
color
and
looks
in
other
ways
after
my
father
the
celt
with
the
fairy
song
on
his
tongue
and
the
restless
feet
that
stole
the
rest
of
him
away
to
and
the
feet
of
him
that
he
lent
me
have
led
me
away
on
as
wide
far
roads
as
ever
his
led
saxon
remembered
her
school
geography
and
with
her
mind
eye
she
saw
a
certain
outline
map
of
a
continent
with
jiggly
wavering
parallel
lines
that
denoted
coast
oh
she
cried
then
you
are
south
mercedes
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
had
to
be
born
somewhere
it
was
a
great
ranch
my
mother
you
could
put
all
oakland
in
one
of
its
smallest
mercedes
higgins
sighed
cheerfully
and
for
the
time
was
lost
in
retrospection
saxon
was
curious
to
hear
more
about
this
woman
who
must
have
lived
much
as
the
had
lived
in
the
old
days
you
received
a
good
education
she
said
tentatively
your
english
is
ah
the
english
came
afterward
and
not
in
school
but
as
it
goes
yes
a
good
education
in
all
things
but
the
most
important
men
that
too
came
afterward
and
little
my
mother
dreamed
she
was
a
grand
lady
what
you
call
a
little
she
dreamed
my
fine
education
was
to
fit
me
in
the
end
for
a
night
watchman
she
laughed
genuinely
at
the
grotesqueness
of
the
idea
night
watchman
laborers
why
we
had
hundreds
yes
thousands
that
toiled
for
us
the
peons
they
are
like
what
you
call
slaves
almost
and
the
cowboys
who
could
ride
two
hundred
miles
between
side
and
side
of
the
ranch
and
in
the
big
house
servants
beyond
remembering
or
counting
la
la
in
my
mother
house
were
many
mercedes
higgins
was
voluble
as
a
greek
and
wandered
on
in
reminiscence
but
our
servants
were
lazy
and
dirty
the
chinese
are
the
servants
par
excellence
so
are
the
japanese
when
you
find
a
good
one
but
not
so
good
as
the
chinese
the
japanese
maidservants
are
pretty
and
merry
but
you
never
know
the
moment
they
leave
you
the
hindoos
are
not
strong
but
very
obedient
they
look
upon
sahibs
and
memsahibs
as
gods
i
was
a
memsahib
which
means
woman
i
once
had
a
russian
cook
who
always
spat
in
the
soup
for
luck
it
was
very
funny
but
we
put
up
with
it
it
was
the
how
you
must
have
traveled
to
have
such
strange
servants
saxon
encouraged
the
old
woman
laughed
corroboration
and
the
strangest
of
all
down
in
the
south
seas
black
slaves
little
cannibals
with
bones
through
their
noses
when
they
did
not
mind
or
when
they
stole
they
were
tied
up
to
a
cocoanut
palm
behind
the
compound
and
lashed
with
whips
of
rhinoceros
hide
they
were
from
an
island
of
cannibals
and
and
they
never
cried
out
it
was
their
pride
there
was
little
vibi
only
twelve
years
old
he
waited
on
me
and
when
his
back
was
cut
in
shreds
and
i
wept
over
him
he
would
only
laugh
and
say
time
little
bit
i
take
head
belong
big
fella
white
marster
that
was
bruce
anstey
the
englishman
who
whipped
him
but
little
vibi
never
got
the
head
he
ran
away
and
the
bushmen
cut
off
his
own
head
and
ate
every
bit
of
saxon
chilled
and
her
face
was
grave
but
mercedes
higgins
rattled
on
ah
those
were
wild
gay
savage
days
would
you
believe
it
my
dear
in
three
years
those
englishmen
of
the
plantation
drank
up
oceans
of
champagne
and
scotch
whisky
and
dropped
thirty
thousand
pounds
on
the
adventure
not
dollars
pounds
which
means
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
they
were
princes
while
it
lasted
it
was
splendid
glorious
it
was
mad
mad
i
sold
half
my
beautiful
jewels
in
new
zealand
before
i
got
started
again
bruce
anstey
blew
out
his
brains
at
the
end
roger
went
mate
on
a
trader
with
a
black
crew
for
eight
pounds
a
month
and
jack
gilbraith
he
was
the
rarest
of
them
all
his
people
were
wealthy
and
titled
and
he
went
home
to
england
and
sold
meat
sat
around
their
big
house
till
they
gave
him
more
money
to
start
a
rubber
plantation
in
the
east
indies
somewhere
on
sumatra
i
think
or
was
it
new
guinea
and
saxon
back
in
her
own
kitchen
and
preparing
supper
for
billy
wondered
what
lusts
and
rapacities
had
led
the
old
woman
from
the
big
peruvian
ranch
through
all
the
world
to
west
oakland
and
barry
higgins
old
barry
was
not
the
sort
who
would
fling
away
his
share
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
much
less
ever
attain
to
such
opulence
besides
she
had
mentioned
the
names
of
other
men
but
not
his
much
more
mercedes
had
talked
in
snatches
and
fragments
there
seemed
no
great
country
nor
city
of
the
old
world
or
the
new
in
which
she
had
not
been
she
had
even
been
in
klondike
ten
years
before
in
a
flashing
sentences
picturing
the
miners
sowing
the
barroom
floors
with
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
gold
dust
always
so
it
seemed
to
saxon
higgins
had
been
with
men
to
whom
money
was
as
water
chapter
iii
saxon
brooding
over
her
problem
of
retaining
billy
love
of
never
staling
the
freshness
of
their
feeling
for
each
other
and
of
never
descending
from
the
heights
which
at
present
they
were
treading
felt
herself
impelled
toward
higgins
she
knew
surely
she
must
know
had
she
not
hinted
knowledge
beyond
ordinary
women
knowledge
several
weeks
went
by
during
which
saxon
was
often
with
her
but
higgins
talked
of
all
other
matters
taught
saxon
the
making
of
certain
simple
laces
and
instructed
her
in
the
arts
of
washing
and
of
marketing
and
then
one
afternoon
saxon
found
higgins
more
voluble
than
usual
with
words
that
rippled
and
tripped
in
their
haste
to
escape
her
eyes
were
flaming
so
flamed
her
face
her
words
were
flames
there
was
a
smell
of
liquor
in
the
air
and
saxon
knew
that
the
old
woman
had
been
drinking
nervous
and
frightened
at
the
same
time
fascinated
saxon
hemstitched
a
linen
handkerchief
intended
for
billy
and
listened
to
mercedes
wild
flow
of
speech
listen
my
dear
i
shall
tell
you
about
the
world
of
men
do
not
be
stupid
like
all
your
people
who
think
me
foolish
and
a
witch
with
the
evil
eye
ha
ha
when
i
think
of
silly
maggie
donahue
pulling
the
shawl
across
her
baby
face
when
we
pass
each
other
on
the
sidewalk
a
witch
i
have
been
is
true
but
my
witchery
was
with
men
oh
i
am
wise
very
wise
my
dear
i
shall
tell
you
of
women
ways
with
men
and
of
men
ways
with
women
the
best
of
them
and
the
worst
of
them
of
the
brute
that
is
in
all
men
of
the
queerness
of
them
that
breaks
the
hearts
of
stupid
women
who
do
not
understand
and
all
women
are
stupid
i
am
not
stupid
la
la
listen
i
am
an
old
woman
and
like
a
woman
i
not
tell
you
how
old
i
am
yet
can
i
hold
men
yet
would
i
hold
men
toothless
and
a
hundred
my
nose
touching
my
chin
not
the
young
men
they
were
mine
in
my
young
days
but
the
old
men
as
befits
my
years
and
well
for
me
the
power
is
mine
in
all
this
world
i
am
without
kin
or
cash
only
have
i
wisdom
and
memories
memories
that
are
ashes
but
royal
ashes
jeweled
ashes
old
women
such
as
i
starve
and
shiver
or
accept
the
pauper
dole
and
the
pauper
shroud
not
i
hold
my
man
true
is
only
barry
higgins
old
barry
heavy
an
ox
but
a
male
man
my
dear
and
queer
as
all
men
are
queer
is
true
he
has
one
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
a
compensation
he
can
not
beat
me
and
old
bones
are
tender
when
the
round
flesh
thins
to
strings
but
when
i
think
of
my
wild
young
lovers
princes
mad
with
the
madness
of
youth
i
have
lived
it
is
enough
i
regret
nothing
and
with
old
barry
i
have
my
surety
of
a
bite
to
eat
and
a
place
by
the
fire
and
why
because
i
know
men
and
shall
never
lose
my
cunning
to
hold
them
is
bitter
sweet
the
knowledge
of
them
more
sweet
than
bitter
men
and
men
and
men
not
stupid
dolts
nor
fat
bourgeois
swine
of
business
men
but
men
of
temperament
of
flame
and
fire
madmen
maybe
but
a
lawless
royal
race
of
madmen
little
you
must
learn
variety
there
lies
the
magic
is
the
golden
key
is
the
toy
that
amuses
without
it
in
the
wife
the
man
is
a
turk
with
it
he
is
her
slave
and
faithful
a
wife
must
be
many
wives
if
you
would
have
your
husband
love
you
must
be
all
women
to
him
you
must
be
ever
new
with
the
dew
of
newness
ever
sparkling
a
flower
that
never
blooms
to
the
fulness
that
fades
you
must
be
a
garden
of
flowers
ever
new
ever
fresh
ever
different
and
in
your
garden
the
man
must
never
pluck
the
last
of
your
posies
listen
little
in
the
garden
of
love
is
a
snake
it
is
the
commonplace
stamp
on
its
head
or
it
will
destroy
the
garden
remember
the
name
commonplace
never
be
too
intimate
men
only
seem
gross
women
are
more
gross
than
no
do
not
argue
little
you
are
an
infant
woman
women
are
less
delicate
than
men
do
i
not
know
of
their
own
husbands
they
will
relate
the
most
intimate
to
other
women
men
never
do
this
of
their
wives
explain
it
there
is
only
one
way
in
all
things
of
love
women
are
less
delicate
it
is
their
mistake
it
is
the
father
and
the
mother
of
the
commonplace
and
it
is
the
commonplace
like
a
loathsome
slug
that
beslimes
and
destroys
love
be
delicate
little
never
be
without
your
veil
without
many
veils
veil
yourself
in
a
thousand
veils
all
shimmering
and
glittering
with
costly
textures
and
precious
jewels
never
let
the
last
veil
be
drawn
against
the
morrow
array
yourself
with
more
veils
ever
more
veils
veils
without
end
yet
the
many
veils
must
not
seem
many
each
veil
must
seem
the
only
one
between
you
and
your
hungry
lover
who
will
have
nothing
less
than
all
of
you
each
time
he
must
seem
to
get
all
to
tear
aside
the
last
veil
that
hides
you
he
must
think
so
it
must
not
be
so
then
there
will
be
no
satiety
for
on
the
morrow
he
will
find
another
last
veil
that
has
escaped
him
remember
each
veil
must
seem
the
last
and
only
one
always
you
must
seem
to
abandon
all
to
his
arms
always
you
must
reserve
more
that
on
the
morrow
and
on
all
the
morrows
you
may
abandon
of
such
is
variety
surprise
so
that
your
man
pursuit
will
be
everlasting
so
that
his
eyes
will
look
to
you
for
newness
and
not
to
other
women
it
was
the
freshness
and
the
newness
of
your
beauty
and
you
the
mystery
of
you
that
won
your
man
when
a
man
has
plucked
and
smelled
all
the
sweetness
of
a
flower
he
looks
for
other
flowers
it
is
his
queerness
you
must
ever
remain
a
flower
almost
plucked
yet
never
plucked
stored
with
vats
of
sweet
unbroached
though
ever
broached
stupid
women
and
all
are
stupid
think
the
first
winning
of
the
man
the
final
victory
then
they
settle
down
and
grow
fat
and
stale
and
dead
and
heartbroken
alas
they
are
so
stupid
but
you
little
with
your
first
victory
you
must
make
your
an
unending
chain
of
victories
each
day
you
must
win
your
man
again
and
when
you
have
won
the
last
victory
when
you
can
find
no
more
to
win
then
ends
love
finis
is
written
and
your
man
wanders
in
strange
gardens
remember
love
must
be
kept
insatiable
it
must
have
an
appetite
and
never
satisfied
you
must
feed
your
lover
well
ah
very
well
most
well
give
give
yet
send
him
away
hungry
to
come
back
to
you
for
higgins
stood
up
suddenly
and
crossed
out
of
the
room
saxon
had
not
failed
to
note
the
litheness
and
grace
in
that
lean
and
withered
body
she
watched
for
higgins
return
and
knew
that
the
litheness
and
grace
had
not
been
imagined
scarcely
have
i
told
you
the
first
letter
in
love
alphabet
said
mercedes
higgins
as
she
reseated
herself
in
her
hands
was
a
tiny
instrument
beautifully
grained
and
richly
brown
which
resembled
a
guitar
save
that
it
bore
four
strings
she
swept
them
back
and
forth
with
rhythmic
forefinger
and
lifted
a
voice
thin
and
mellow
in
a
fashion
of
melody
that
was
strange
and
in
a
foreign
tongue
and
softly
throbbing
voice
and
strings
arose
on
sensuous
crests
of
song
died
away
to
whisperings
and
caresses
drifted
through
and
twilights
or
swelled
again
to
barbarically
imperious
in
which
were
woven
plaintive
calls
and
madnesses
of
invitation
and
promise
it
went
through
saxon
until
she
was
as
this
instrument
swept
with
passional
strains
it
seemed
to
her
a
dream
and
almost
was
she
dizzy
when
mercedes
higgins
ceased
if
your
man
had
clasped
the
last
of
you
and
if
all
of
you
were
known
to
him
as
an
old
story
yet
did
you
sing
that
one
song
as
i
have
sung
it
yet
would
his
arms
again
go
out
to
you
and
his
eyes
grow
warm
with
the
old
mad
lights
do
you
see
do
you
understand
little
saxon
could
only
nod
her
lips
too
dry
for
speech
the
golden
koa
the
king
of
woods
mercedes
was
crooning
over
the
instrument
the
ukulele
that
is
what
the
hawaiians
call
it
which
means
my
dear
the
jumping
flea
they
are
the
hawaiians
a
race
of
lovers
all
in
the
warm
cool
of
the
tropic
night
where
the
trade
winds
again
she
struck
the
strings
she
sang
in
another
language
which
saxon
deemed
must
be
french
it
was
a
lilt
tripping
and
tickling
her
large
eyes
at
times
grew
larger
and
wilder
and
again
narrowed
in
enticement
and
wickedness
when
she
ended
she
looked
to
saxon
for
a
verdict
i
do
like
that
one
so
well
saxon
said
mercedes
shrugged
her
shoulders
they
all
have
their
worth
little
with
so
much
to
learn
there
are
times
when
men
may
be
won
with
wine
there
are
times
when
men
may
be
won
with
the
wine
of
song
so
queer
they
are
la
la
so
many
ways
so
many
ways
there
are
your
pretties
my
dear
your
dainties
they
are
magic
nets
no
fisherman
upon
the
sea
ever
tangled
fish
more
successfully
than
we
women
with
our
flimsies
you
are
on
the
right
path
i
have
seen
men
enmeshed
by
a
corset
cover
no
prettier
no
daintier
than
these
of
yours
i
have
seen
on
the
line
i
have
called
the
washing
of
fine
linen
an
art
but
it
is
not
for
itself
alone
the
greatest
of
the
arts
is
the
conquering
of
men
love
is
the
sum
of
all
the
arts
as
it
is
the
reason
for
their
existence
listen
in
all
times
and
ages
have
been
women
great
wise
women
they
did
not
need
to
be
beautiful
greater
than
all
woman
beauty
was
their
wisdom

and
thereafter
saxon
listened
in
a
maze
to
what
almost
seemed
a
wild
farrago
save
that
the
strange
meaningless
phrases
were
fraught
with
dim
mysterious
significance
she
caught
glimmerings
of
profounds
inexpressible
and
unthinkable
that
hinted
connotations
lawless
and
terrible
the
woman
speech
was
a
lava
rush
scorching
and
searing
and
saxon
cheeks
and
forehead
and
neck
burned
with
a
blush
that
continuously
increased
she
trembled
with
fear
suffered
qualms
of
nausea
thought
sometimes
that
she
would
faint
so
madly
reeled
her
brain
yet
she
could
not
tear
herself
away
and
sat
on
and
on
her
sewing
forgotten
on
her
lap
staring
with
inward
sight
upon
a
nightmare
vision
beyond
all
imagining
at
last
when
it
seemed
she
could
endure
no
more
and
while
she
was
wetting
her
dry
lips
to
cry
out
in
protest
mercedes
ceased
and
here
endeth
the
first
lesson
she
said
quite
calmly
then
laughed
with
a
laughter
that
was
tantalizing
and
tormenting
what
is
the
matter
you
are
not
shocked
i
am
frightened
saxon
quavered
huskily
with
a
of
nervousness
you
frighten
me
i
am
very
foolish
and
i
know
so
little
that
i
had
never
dreamed
mercedes
nodded
her
head
comprehendingly
it
is
indeed
to
be
frightened
at
she
said
it
is
solemn
it
is
terrible
it
is
magnificent
chapter
iv
saxon
had
been
all
her
days
though
her
field
of
vision
had
been
restricted
from
her
childhood
days
with
the
saloonkeeper
cady
and
cady
but
unmoral
spouse
she
had
observed
and
later
generalized
much
upon
sex
she
knew
the
problem
of
retaining
a
husband
love
as
few
wives
of
any
class
knew
it
just
as
she
knew
the
problem
of
selecting
a
husband
as
few
girls
of
the
working
class
knew
it
she
had
of
herself
developed
an
eminently
rational
philosophy
of
love
instinctively
and
consciously
too
she
had
made
toward
delicacy
and
shunned
the
perils
of
the
habitual
and
commonplace
thoroughly
aware
she
was
that
as
she
cheapened
herself
so
did
she
cheapen
love
never
in
the
weeks
of
their
married
life
had
billy
found
her
dowdy
or
harshly
irritable
or
lethargic
and
she
had
deliberately
permeated
her
house
with
her
personal
atmosphere
of
coolness
and
freshness
and
equableness
nor
had
she
been
ignorant
of
such
assets
as
surprise
and
charm
her
imagination
had
not
been
asleep
and
she
had
been
born
with
wisdom
in
billy
she
had
won
a
prize
and
she
knew
it
she
appreciated
his
lover
ardor
and
was
proud
his
liberality
his
desire
for
everything
of
the
best
his
own
personal
cleanliness
and
care
of
himself
she
recognized
as
far
beyond
the
average
he
was
never
coarse
he
met
delicacy
with
delicacy
though
it
was
obvious
to
her
that
the
initiative
in
all
such
matters
lay
with
her
and
must
lie
with
her
always
he
was
largely
unconscious
of
what
he
did
and
why
but
she
knew
in
all
full
clarity
of
judgment
and
he
was
such
a
prize
among
men
despite
her
clear
sight
of
her
problem
of
keeping
billy
a
lover
and
despite
the
considerable
knowledge
and
experience
arrayed
before
her
mental
vision
mercedes
higgins
had
spread
before
her
a
vastly
wider
panorama
the
old
woman
had
verified
her
own
conclusions
given
her
new
ideas
clinched
old
ones
and
even
savagely
emphasized
the
tragic
importance
of
the
whole
problem
much
saxon
remembered
of
that
mad
preachment
much
she
guessed
and
felt
and
much
had
been
beyond
her
experience
and
understanding
but
the
metaphors
of
the
veils
and
the
flowers
and
the
rules
of
giving
to
abandonment
with
always
more
to
abandon
she
grasped
thoroughly
and
she
was
enabled
to
formulate
a
bigger
and
stronger
in
the
light
of
the
revelation
she
the
married
lives
of
all
she
had
ever
known
and
with
sharp
definiteness
as
never
before
she
saw
where
and
why
so
many
of
them
had
failed
with
renewed
ardor
saxon
devoted
herself
to
her
household
to
her
pretties
and
to
her
charms
she
marketed
with
a
keener
desire
for
the
best
though
never
ignoring
the
need
for
economy
from
the
women
pages
of
the
sunday
supplements
and
from
the
women
magazines
in
the
free
reading
room
two
blocks
away
she
gleaned
many
ideas
for
the
preservation
of
her
looks
in
a
systematic
way
she
exercised
the
various
parts
of
her
body
and
a
certain
period
of
time
each
day
she
employed
in
facial
exercises
and
massage
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
the
roundness
and
freshness
and
firmness
and
color
billy
did
not
know
these
intimacies
of
the
toilette
were
not
for
him
the
results
only
were
his
she
drew
books
from
the
carnegie
library
and
studied
physiology
and
hygiene
and
learned
a
myriad
of
things
about
herself
and
the
ways
of
woman
health
that
she
had
never
been
taught
by
sarah
the
women
of
the
orphan
asylum
nor
by
cady
after
long
debate
she
subscribed
to
a
woman
magazine
the
patterns
and
lessons
of
which
she
decided
were
the
best
suited
to
her
taste
and
purse
the
other
woman
magazines
she
had
access
to
in
the
free
reading
room
and
more
than
one
pattern
of
lace
and
embroidery
she
copied
by
means
of
tracing
paper
before
the
lingerie
windows
of
the
uptown
shops
she
often
stood
and
studied
nor
was
she
above
taking
advantage
when
small
purchases
were
made
of
looking
over
the
goods
at
the
underwear
counters
once
she
even
considered
taking
up
with
china
but
gave
over
the
idea
when
she
learned
its
expensiveness
she
slowly
replaced
all
her
simple
maiden
underlinen
with
garments
which
while
still
simple
were
wrought
with
beautiful
french
embroidery
tucks
and
drawnwork
she
crocheted
fine
edgings
on
the
inexpensive
knitted
underwear
she
wore
in
winter
she
made
little
corset
covers
and
chemises
of
fine
but
fairly
inexpensive
lawns
and
with
simple
flowered
designs
and
perfect
laundering
her
nightgowns
were
always
sweetly
fresh
and
dainty
in
some
publication
she
ran
across
a
brief
printed
note
to
the
effect
that
french
women
were
just
beginning
to
wear
fascinating
beruffled
caps
at
the
breakfast
table
it
meant
nothing
to
her
that
in
her
case
she
must
first
prepare
the
breakfast
promptly
appeared
in
the
house
a
yard
of
dotted
swiss
muslin
and
saxon
was
deep
in
experimenting
on
patterns
for
herself
and
in
sorting
her
bits
of
laces
for
suitable
trimmings
the
resultant
dainty
creation
won
mercedes
higgins
enthusiastic
approval
saxon
made
for
herself
simple
house
slips
of
pretty
gingham
with
neat
low
collars
turned
back
from
her
fresh
round
throat
she
crocheted
yards
of
laces
for
her
underwear
and
made
battenberg
in
abundance
for
her
table
and
for
the
bureau
a
great
achievement
that
aroused
applause
was
an
afghan
for
the
bed
she
even
ventured
a
rag
carpet
which
the
women
magazines
informed
her
had
newly
returned
into
fashion
as
a
matter
of
course
she
hemstitched
the
best
table
linen
and
bed
linen
they
could
afford
as
the
happy
months
went
by
she
was
never
idle
nor
was
billy
forgotten
when
the
cold
weather
came
on
she
knitted
him
wristlets
which
he
always
religiously
wore
from
the
house
and
pocketed
immediately
thereafter
the
two
sweaters
she
made
for
him
however
received
a
better
fate
as
did
the
slippers
which
she
insisted
on
his
slipping
into
on
the
evenings
they
remained
at
home
the
hard
practical
wisdom
of
mercedes
higgins
proved
of
immense
help
for
saxon
strove
with
a
fervor
almost
religious
to
have
everything
of
the
best
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
saving
here
she
faced
the
financial
and
economic
problem
of
keeping
house
in
a
society
where
the
cost
of
living
rose
faster
than
the
wages
of
industry
and
here
the
old
woman
taught
her
the
science
of
marketing
so
thoroughly
that
she
made
a
dollar
of
billy
go
half
as
far
again
as
the
wives
of
the
neighborhood
made
the
dollars
of
their
men
go
invariably
on
saturday
night
billy
poured
his
total
wages
into
her
lap
he
never
asked
for
an
accounting
of
what
she
did
with
it
though
he
continually
reiterated
that
he
had
never
fed
so
well
in
his
life
and
always
the
wages
still
untouched
in
her
lap
she
had
him
take
out
what
he
estimated
he
would
need
for
spending
money
for
the
week
to
come
not
only
did
she
bid
him
take
plenty
but
she
insisted
on
his
taking
any
amount
extra
that
he
might
desire
at
any
time
through
the
week
and
further
she
insisted
he
should
not
tell
her
what
it
was
for
you
always
had
money
in
your
pocket
she
reminded
him
and
no
reason
marriage
should
change
that
if
it
did
i
wish
i
never
married
you
oh
i
know
about
men
when
they
get
together
first
one
treats
and
then
another
and
it
takes
money
now
if
you
ca
treat
just
as
freely
as
the
rest
of
them
why
i
know
you
so
well
that
i
know
stay
away
from
them
and
that
would
be
right
to
you
i
mean
i
want
you
to
be
together
with
men
it
good
for
a
and
billy
buried
her
in
his
arms
and
swore
she
was
the
greatest
little
bit
of
woman
that
ever
came
down
the
pike
why
he
jubilated
not
only
do
i
feed
better
and
live
more
comfortable
and
hold
up
my
end
with
the
fellows
but
i
actually
saving
money
or
you
are
for
me
here
i
am
with
furniture
being
paid
for
regular
every
month
and
a
little
woman
i
mad
over
and
on
top
of
it
money
in
the
bank
how
much
is
it
now
dollars
she
told
him
not
so
bad
for
a
rainy
day
you
might
get
sick
or
hurt
or
something
it
was
in
when
billy
with
quite
a
deal
of
obvious
reluctance
broached
a
money
matter
to
saxon
his
old
friend
billy
murphy
was
laid
up
with
la
grippe
and
one
of
his
children
playing
in
the
street
had
been
seriously
injured
by
a
passing
wagon
billy
murphy
still
feeble
after
two
weeks
in
bed
had
asked
billy
for
the
loan
of
fifty
dollars
it
perfectly
safe
billy
concluded
to
saxon
i
known
him
since
we
was
kids
at
the
durant
school
together
he
straight
as
a
that
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
saxon
chided
if
you
were
single
you
have
lent
it
to
him
immediately
would
you
billy
nodded
then
it
no
different
because
you
married
it
your
money
not
by
a
damn
sight
he
cried
it
ai
mine
it
ourn
and
i
would
think
of
lettin
anybody
have
it
without
seein
you
i
hope
you
did
tell
him
that
she
said
with
quick
concern
nope
billy
laughed
i
knew
if
i
did
you
be
a
hatter
i
just
told
him
i
try
an
figure
it
out
after
all
i
was
sure
stand
for
it
if
you
had
oh
billy
she
murmured
her
voice
rich
and
low
with
love
maybe
you
do
know
it
but
that
one
of
the
sweetest
things
you
said
since
we
got
the
more
saxon
saw
of
mercedes
higgins
the
less
did
she
understand
her
that
the
old
woman
was
a
miser
saxon
soon
learned
and
this
trait
she
found
hard
to
reconcile
with
her
tales
of
squandering
on
the
other
hand
saxon
was
bewildered
by
mercedes
extravagance
in
personal
matters
her
underlinen
of
course
was
very
costly
the
table
she
set
for
barry
was
good
but
the
table
for
herself
was
vastly
better
yet
both
tables
were
set
on
the
same
table
while
barry
contented
himself
with
solid
round
steak
mercedes
ate
tenderloin
a
huge
tough
muttonchop
on
barry
plate
would
be
balanced
by
tiny
french
chops
on
mercedes
plate
tea
was
brewed
in
separate
pots
so
was
coffee
while
barry
gulped
cent
tea
from
a
large
and
heavy
mug
mercedes
sipped
tea
from
a
tiny
cup
of
belleek
fragile
as
all
in
the
same
manner
his
cent
coffee
was
diluted
with
milk
her
eighty
cent
turkish
with
cream
is
good
enough
for
the
old
man
she
told
saxon
he
knows
no
better
and
it
would
be
a
wicked
sin
to
waste
it
on
little
traffickings
began
between
the
two
women
after
mercedes
had
freely
taught
saxon
the
facility
of
playing
accompaniments
on
the
ukulele
she
proposed
an
exchange
her
time
was
past
she
said
for
such
frivolities
and
she
offered
the
instrument
for
the
breakfast
cap
of
which
saxon
had
made
so
good
a
success
it
worth
a
few
dollars
mercedes
said
it
cost
me
twenty
though
that
was
years
ago
yet
it
is
well
worth
the
value
of
the
but
would
the
cap
be
frivolous
too
saxon
queried
though
herself
well
pleased
with
the
bargain
is
not
for
my
graying
hair
mercedes
frankly
disclaimed
i
shall
sell
it
for
the
money
much
that
i
do
when
the
rheumatism
is
not
maddening
my
fingers
i
sell
la
la
my
dear
is
not
old
barry
fifty
a
month
that
satisfy
all
my
expensive
tastes
is
i
that
make
up
the
difference
and
old
age
needs
money
as
never
youth
needs
it
some
day
you
will
learn
for
i
am
well
satisfied
with
the
trade
saxon
said
and
i
shall
make
me
another
cap
when
i
can
lay
aside
enough
for
the
make
several
mercedes
advised
i
sell
them
for
you
keeping
of
course
a
small
commission
for
my
services
i
can
give
you
six
dollars
apiece
for
them
we
will
consult
about
them
the
profit
will
more
than
provide
material
for
your
chapter
v
four
eventful
things
happened
in
the
course
of
the
winter
bert
and
mary
got
married
and
rented
a
cottage
in
the
neighborhood
three
blocks
away
billy
wages
were
cut
along
with
the
wages
of
all
the
teamsters
in
oakland
billy
took
up
shaving
with
a
safety
razor
and
finally
saxon
was
proven
a
false
prophet
and
sarah
a
true
one
saxon
made
up
her
mind
beyond
any
doubt
ere
she
confided
the
news
to
billy
at
first
while
still
suspecting
she
had
felt
a
frightened
sinking
of
the
heart
and
fear
of
the
unknown
and
unexperienced
then
had
come
economic
fear
as
she
contemplated
the
increased
expense
entailed
but
by
the
time
she
had
made
surety
doubly
sure
all
was
swept
away
before
a
wave
of
passionate
gladness
hers
and
billy
the
phrase
was
continually
in
her
mind
and
each
recurrent
thought
of
it
brought
an
actual
physical
to
her
heart
the
night
she
told
the
news
to
billy
he
withheld
his
own
news
of
the
and
joined
with
her
in
welcoming
the
little
one
what
we
do
go
to
the
theater
to
celebrate
he
asked
relaxing
the
pressure
of
his
embrace
so
that
she
might
speak
or
suppose
we
stay
in
just
you
and
me
and
and
the
three
of
us
stay
in
was
her
verdict
i
just
want
you
to
hold
me
and
hold
me
and
hold
that
what
i
wanted
too
only
i
was
sure
after
bein
in
the
house
all
day
maybe
you
want
to
go
there
was
frost
in
the
air
and
billy
brought
the
morris
chair
in
by
the
kitchen
stove
she
lay
cuddled
in
his
arms
her
head
on
his
shoulder
his
cheek
against
her
hair
we
did
make
no
mistake
in
our
lightning
marriage
with
only
a
courtin
he
reflected
aloud
why
saxon
we
been
courtin
ever
since
just
the
same
and
now
my
god
saxon
it
too
wonderful
to
be
true
think
of
it
ourn
the
three
of
us
the
little
rascal
i
bet
goin
to
be
a
boy
an
wo
i
learn
to
put
up
his
fists
an
take
care
of
himself
an
swimmin
too
if
he
do
know
how
to
swim
by
the
time
he
six
and
if
he
a
girl
she
goin
to
be
a
boy
billy
retorted
joining
in
the
playful
misuse
of
pronouns
and
both
laughed
and
kissed
and
sighed
with
content
i
goin
to
turn
pincher
now
he
announced
after
quite
an
interval
of
meditation
no
more
drinks
with
the
boys
it
me
for
the
water
wagon
and
i
goin
to
ease
down
on
smokes
huh
do
see
why
i
ca
roll
my
own

and

cheek
billy
it
is

and
billy
resolutely
kept
undivulged
the
cut
in
wages
not
until
two
weeks
later
when
it
went
into
effect
and
he
poured
the
diminished
sum
into
her
lap
did
he
break
it
to
her
the
next
day
bert
and
mary
already
a
month
married
had
sunday
dinner
with
them
and
the
matter
came
up
for
discussion
bert
was
particularly
pessimistic
and
muttered
dark
hints
of
an
impending
strike
in
the
railroad
shops
if
you
all
shut
your
traps
it
be
all
right
mary
criticized
these

give
me
the
cramp
the
way
they
butt
in
an
stir

gently
because

had

bert
argued
the

thing

back
to
the
she
held
her
right
hand
up
and
spoke
with
the
solemnity
of
an
oath
not
so
you
can
see
it
never
again
for
yours
oh
i
know
what
you
drivin
at
bert
said
with
asperity
an

an
there
nothin
else
to
i
guess
i
kept
straight
before
i
met
you
she
came
back
with
a
toss
of
the
head
and
i
kept
straight
after
i
met
you
which
is
going
some
if
anybody
should
ask
hot
words
were
on
bert
tongue
but
saxon
intervened
and
brought
about
peace
she
was
concerned
over
the
outcome
of
their
marriage
both
were
highstrung
both
were
quick
and
irritable
and
their
continual
clashes
did
not
augur
well
for
their
future
the
safety
razor
was
a
great
achievement
for
saxon
privily
she
conferred
with
a
clerk
she
knew
in
pierce
hardware
store
and
made
the
purchase
on
sunday
morning
after
breakfast
when
billy
was
starting
to
go
to
the
barber
shop
she
led
him
into
the
bedroom
whisked
a
towel
aside
and
revealed
the
razor
box
shaving
mug
soap
brush
and
lather
all
ready
billy
recoiled
then
came
back
to
make
curious
investigation
he
gazed
pityingly
at
the
safety
razor
huh
call
that
a
man
tool
it
do
the
work
she
said
it
does
it
for
thousands
of
men
every
but
billy
shook
his
head
and
backed
away
you
shave
three
times
a
week
she
urged
that
cents
call
it
half
a
dollar
and
there
are
weeks
in
the
year
dollars
a
year
just
for
shaving
come
on
dear
and
try
it
lots
of
men
swear
by
he
shook
his
head
mutinously
and
the
cloudy
deeps
of
his
eyes
grew
more
cloudy
she
loved
that
sullen
handsomeness
that
made
him
look
so
boyish
and
laughing
and
kissing
him
she
forced
him
into
a
chair
got
off
his
coat
and
unbuttoned
shirt
and
undershirt
and
turned
them
in
threatening
him
with
if
you
open
your
mouth
to
kick
i
shove
it
in
she
coated
his
face
with
lather
wait
a
minute
she
checked
him
as
he
reached
desperately
for
the
razor
i
been
watching
the
barbers
from
the
sidewalk
this
is
what
they
do
after
the
lather
is
and
thereupon
she
proceeded
to
rub
the
lather
in
with
her
fingers
there
she
said
when
she
had
coated
his
face
a
second
time
ready
to
begin
only
remember
i
not
always
going
to
do
this
for
you
i
just
breaking
you
in
you
with
great
outward
show
of
rebellion
half
genuine
half
facetious
he
made
several
tentative
scrapes
with
the
razor
he
winced
violently
and
violently
exclaimed
holy
jumping
jehosaphat
he
examined
his
face
in
the
glass
and
a
streak
of
blood
showed
in
the
midst
of
the
lather
cut
by
a
safety
razor
by
god
sure
men
swear
by
it
ca
blame
cut
by
a
safety
but
wait
a
second
saxon
pleaded
they
have
to
be
regulated
the
clerk
told
me
see
those
little
screws
there
that
it
turn
them
again
billy
applied
the
blade
to
his
face
after
a
couple
of
scrapes
he
looked
at
himself
closely
in
the
mirror
grinned
and
went
on
shaving
with
swiftness
and
dexterity
he
scraped
his
face
clean
of
lather
saxon
clapped
her
hands
fine
billy
approved
great
here
give
me
your
hand
see
what
a
good
job
it
he
started
to
rub
her
hand
against
his
cheek
saxon
jerked
away
with
a
little
cry
of
disappointment
then
examined
him
closely
it
has
shaved
at
all
she
said
it
a
fake
that
what
it
is
it
cuts
the
hide
but
not
the
hair
me
for
the
but
saxon
was
persistent
you
have
given
it
a
fair
trial
yet
it
was
regulated
too
much
let
me
try
my
hand
at
it
there
that
it
betwixt
and
between
now
lather
again
and
try
this
time
the
unmistakable
sound
of
could
be
heard
how
is
it
she
fluttered
anxiously
it
gets
the
ouch
hair
billy
grunted
frowning
and
making
faces
but
it
gee
say
ouch
pulls
like
sam
stay
with
it
she
encouraged
do
give
up
the
ship
big
injun
with
a
scalplock
remember
what
bert
says
and
be
the
last
of
the
at
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
he
rinsed
his
face
and
dried
it
sighing
with
relief
it
a
shave
in
a
fashion
saxon
but
i
ca
say
i
stuck
on
it
it
takes
out
the
nerve
i
as
weak
as
a
he
groaned
with
sudden
discovery
of
fresh
misfortune
what
the
matter
now
she
asked
the
back
of
my
neck
how
can
i
shave
the
back
of
my
neck
i
have
to
pay
a
barber
to
do
saxon
consternation
was
tragic
but
it
only
lasted
a
moment
she
took
the
brush
in
her
hand
sit
down
what
you
he
demanded
indignantly
yes
me
if
any
barber
is
good
enough
to
shave
your
neck
and
then
i
am
billy
moaned
and
groaned
in
the
abjectness
of
humility
and
surrender
and
let
her
have
her
way
there
and
a
good
job
she
informed
him
when
she
had
finished
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
and
besides
it
means
dollars
a
year
and
you
buy
the
crib
the
baby
buggy
the
pinning
blankets
and
lots
and
lots
of
things
with
it
now
sit
still
a
minute
she
rinsed
and
dried
the
back
of
his
neck
and
dusted
it
with
talcum
powder
you
as
sweet
as
a
clean
little
baby
billy
the
unexpected
and
lingering
impact
of
her
lips
on
the
back
of
his
neck
made
him
writhe
with
mingled
feelings
not
all
unpleasant
two
days
later
though
vowing
in
the
intervening
time
to
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
instrument
of
the
devil
he
permitted
saxon
to
assist
him
to
a
second
shave
this
time
it
went
easier
it
ai
so
bad
he
admitted
i
gettin
the
hang
of
it
it
all
in
the
regulating
you
can
shave
as
close
as
you
want
an
no
more
close
than
you
want
barbers
ca
do
that
every
once
an
awhile
they
get
my
face
the
third
shave
was
an
unqualified
success
and
the
culminating
bliss
was
reached
when
saxon
presented
him
with
a
bottle
of
witch
hazel
after
that
he
began
active
proselyting
he
could
not
wait
a
visit
from
bert
but
carried
the
paraphernalia
to
the
latter
house
to
demonstrate
we
ben
boobs
all
these
years
bert
runnin
the
chances
of
itch
an
everything
look
at
this
eh
see
her
take
hold
smooth
as
silk
just
as
easy
there
six
minutes
by
the
clock
can
you
beat
it
when
i
get
my
hand
in
i
can
do
it
in
three
it
works
in
the
dark
it
works
under
water
you
could
cut
yourself
if
you
tried
and
it
saves
dollars
a
year
saxon
figured
it
out
and
she
a
wonder
i
tell
chapter
vi
the
trafficking
between
saxon
and
mercedes
increased
the
latter
commanded
a
ready
market
for
all
the
fine
work
saxon
could
supply
while
saxon
was
eager
and
happy
in
the
work
the
expected
babe
and
the
cut
in
billy
wages
had
caused
her
to
regard
the
economic
phase
of
existence
more
seriously
than
ever
too
little
money
was
being
laid
away
in
the
bank
and
her
conscience
pricked
her
as
she
considered
how
much
she
was
laying
out
on
the
pretty
necessaries
for
the
household
and
herself
also
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
spending
earnings
since
a
young
girl
she
had
been
used
to
spending
her
own
and
now
thanks
to
mercedes
she
was
doing
it
again
and
out
of
her
profits
assaying
more
expensive
and
delightful
adventures
in
lingerie
mercedes
suggested
and
saxon
carried
out
and
even
bettered
the
dainty
things
of
thread
and
texture
she
made
ruffled
chemises
of
sheer
linen
with
her
own
fine
edgings
and
french
embroidery
on
breast
and
shoulders
linen
combination
undersuits
and
nightgowns
fairy
and
cobwebby
embroidered
trimmed
with
irish
lace
on
mercedes
instigation
she
executed
an
ambitious
and
wonderful
breakfast
cap
for
which
the
old
woman
returned
her
twelve
dollars
after
deducting
commission
she
was
happy
and
busy
every
waking
moment
nor
was
preparation
for
the
little
one
neglected
the
only
ready
made
garments
she
bought
were
three
fine
little
knit
shirts
as
for
the
rest
every
bit
was
made
by
her
own
hands
featherstitched
pinning
blankets
a
crocheted
jacket
and
cap
knitted
mittens
embroidered
bonnets
slim
little
princess
slips
of
sensible
length
underskirts
on
absurd
lilliputian
yokes
white
flannel
petticoats
stockings
and
crocheted
boots
seeming
to
burgeon
before
her
eyes
with
wriggly
pink
toes
and
plump
little
calves
and
last
but
not
least
many
deliciously
soft
squares
of
linen
a
little
later
as
a
crowning
masterpiece
she
was
guilty
of
a
dress
coat
of
white
silk
embroidered
and
into
all
the
tiny
garments
with
every
stitch
she
sewed
love
yet
this
love
so
unceasingly
sewn
she
knew
when
she
came
to
consider
and
marvel
was
more
of
billy
than
of
the
nebulous
ungraspable
new
bit
of
life
that
eluded
her
fondest
attempts
at
visioning
huh
was
billy
comment
as
he
went
over
the
mite
wardrobe
and
came
back
to
center
on
the
little
knit
shirts
they
look
more
like
a
real
kid
than
the
whole
kit
an
caboodle
why
i
can
see
him
in
them
regular
saxon
with
a
sudden
rush
of
happy
unshed
tears
held
one
of
the
little
shirts
up
to
his
lips
he
kissed
it
solemnly
his
eyes
resting
on
saxon
that
some
for
the
boy
he
said
but
a
whole
lot
for
but
saxon
was
doomed
to
cease
ignominiously
and
tragically
one
day
to
take
advantage
of
a
department
store
bargain
sale
she
crossed
the
bay
to
san
francisco
passing
along
sutter
street
her
eye
was
attracted
by
a
display
in
the
small
window
of
a
small
shop
at
first
she
could
not
believe
it
yet
there
in
the
honored
place
of
the
window
was
the
wonderful
breakfast
cap
for
which
she
had
received
twelve
dollars
from
mercedes
it
was
marked
dollars
saxon
went
in
and
interviewed
the
shopkeeper
an
emaciated
and
woman
of
foreign
extraction
oh
i
do
want
to
buy
anything
saxon
said
i
make
nice
things
like
you
have
here
and
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
pay
for
them
for
that
breakfast
cap
in
the
window
for
the
woman
darted
a
keen
glance
to
saxon
left
hand
noted
the
innumerable
tiny
punctures
in
the
ends
of
the
first
and
second
fingers
then
appraised
her
clothing
and
her
face
can
you
do
work
like
that
saxon
nodded
i
paid
twenty
dollars
to
the
woman
that
made
saxon
repressed
an
almost
spasmodic
gasp
and
thought
coolly
for
a
space
mercedes
had
given
her
twelve
then
mercedes
had
pocketed
eight
while
she
saxon
had
furnished
the
material
and
labor
would
you
please
show
me
other
things
nightgowns
chemises
and
such
things
and
tell
me
the
prices
you
pay
can
you
do
such
work
and
will
you
sell
to
me
certainly
saxon
answered
that
is
why
i
am
we
add
only
a
small
amount
when
we
sell
the
woman
went
on
you
see
light
and
rent
and
such
things
as
well
as
a
profit
or
else
we
could
not
be
it
only
fair
saxon
agreed
amongst
the
beautiful
stuff
saxon
went
over
she
found
a
nightgown
and
a
combination
undersuit
of
her
own
manufacture
for
the
former
she
had
received
eight
dollars
from
mercedes
it
was
marked
eighteen
and
the
woman
had
paid
fourteen
for
the
latter
saxon
received
six
it
was
marked
fifteen
and
the
woman
had
paid
eleven
thank
you
saxon
said
as
she
drew
on
her
gloves
i
should
like
to
bring
you
some
of
my
work
at
those
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
buy
it
if
it
is
up
to
the
the
woman
looked
at
her
severely
mind
you
it
must
be
as
good
as
this
and
if
it
is
i
often
get
special
orders
and
i
give
you
a
chance
at
mercedes
was
unblushingly
candid
when
saxon
reproached
her
you
told
me
you
took
only
a
commission
was
saxon
accusation
so
i
did
and
so
i
but
i
did
all
the
work
and
bought
all
the
materials
yet
you
actually
cleared
more
out
of

my
dear

was
the
middleman
it
the
way
of
the
world
is
the
middlemen
that
get
the
lion
it
seems
to
me
most
unfair
saxon
reflected
more
in
sadness
than
anger
that
is
your
quarrel
with
the
world
not
with
me
mercedes
rejoined
sharply
then
immediately
softened
with
one
of
her
quick
changes
we
must
quarrel

dear
i
like

much

and

his
last
long
sleep
a
stupid
dull
old
man
heavy
an
ox
is
true
but
a
good
old
fool
with
no
trace
of
evil
in
him
the
plot
is
bought
and
paid
for
the
final
installment
was
made
up
in
part
out
of
my
commissions
from
you
then
there

the
funeral
expenses

must
be
done
nicely

have
still
much
to
save
and
barry
may
turn
up
his
toes
any
saxon
sniffed
the
air
carefully
and
knew
the
old
woman
had
been
drinking
again
come
my
dear
let
me
show
leading
saxon
to
a
large
sea
chest
in
the
bedroom
mercedes
lifted
the
lid
a
faint
perfume
as
of
floated
up
behold
my
burial
trousseau
thus
i
shall
wed
the
saxon
amazement
increased
as
article
by
article
the
old
woman
displayed
the
airiest
the
daintiest
the
most
delicious
and
most
complete
of
bridal
outfits
mercedes
held
up
an
ivory
fan
in
venice
was
given
me
my
see
this
comb
turtle
shell
bruce
anstey
made
it
for
me
the
week
before
he
drank
his
last
bottle
and
scattered
his
brave
mad
brains
with
a
colt
this
scarf
la
la
a
liberty
scarf
and
all
that
will
be
buried
with
you
saxon
mused
oh
the
extravagance
of
it
mercedes
laughed
why
not
i
shall
die
as
i
have
lived
it
is
my
pleasure
i
go
to
the
dust
as
a
bride
no
cold
and
narrow
bed
for
me
i
would
it
were
a
coach
covered
with
the
soft
things
of
the
east
and
pillows
pillows
without
it
would
buy
you
twenty
funerals
and
twenty
plots
saxon
protested
shocked
by
this
blasphemy
of
conventional
death
it
is
downright
be
as
i
have
lived
mercedes
said
complacently
and
it
a
fine
bride
old
barry
have
to
come
and
lie
beside
she
closed
the
lid
and
sighed
though
i
wish
it
were
bruce
anstey
or
any
of
the
pick
of
my
young
men
to
lie
with
me
in
the
great
dark
and
to
crumble
with
me
to
the
dust
that
is
the
real
she
gazed
at
saxon
with
eyes
heated
by
alcohol
and
at
the
same
time
cool
with
the
coolness
of
content
in
the
old
days
the
great
of
earth
were
buried
with
their
live
slaves
with
them
i
but
take
my
flimsies
my
then
you
are
afraid
of
death
in
the
least
mercedes
shook
her
head
emphatically
death
is
brave
and
good
and
kind
i
do
not
fear
death
is
of
men
i
am
afraid
when
i
am
dead
so
i
prepare
they
shall
not
have
me
when
i
am
saxon
was
puzzled
they
would
not
want
you
then
she
said
many
are
wanted
was
the
answer
do
you
know
what
becomes
of
the
aged
poor
who
have
no
money
for
burial
they
are
not
buried
let
me
tell
you
we
stood
before
great
doors
he
was
a
queer
man
a
professor
who
ought
to
have
been
a
pirate
a
man
who
lectured
in
class
rooms
when
he
ought
to
have
been
storming
walled
cities
or
robbing
banks
he
was
slender
like
don
juan
his
hands
were
strong
as
steel
so
was
his
spirit
and
he
was
mad
a
bit
mad
as
all
my
young
men
have
been
mercedes
he
said
will
inspect
our
brethren
and
become
humble
and
glad
that
we
are
not
as
they
as
yet
not
yet
and
afterward
we
will
dine
with
a
more
devilish
taste
and
we
will
drink
to
them
in
golden
wine
that
will
be
the
more
golden
for
having
seen
them
come
mercedes
he
thrust
the
great
doors
open
and
by
the
hand
led
me
in
it
was
a
sad
company
that
lay
on
marble
slabs
or
sat
half
erect
and
propped
while
many
young
men
bright
of
eye
bright
little
knives
in
their
hands
glanced
curiously
at
me
from
their
they
were
dead
saxon
interrupted
to
gasp
they
were
the
pauper
dead
my
dear
mercedes
said
he
is
more
to
show
you
that
will
make
us
glad
we
are
alive
and
he
took
me
down
down
to
the
vats
the
salt
vats
my
dear
i
was
not
afraid
but
it
was
in
my
mind
then
as
i
looked
how
it
would
be
with
me
when
i
was
dead
and
there
they
were
so
many
lumps
of
pork
and
the
order
came
woman
an
old
woman
and
the
man
who
worked
there
fished
in
the
vats
the
first
was
a
man
he
drew
to
see
again
he
fished
and
stirred
again
a
man
he
was
impatient
and
grumbled
at
his
luck
and
then
up
through
the
brine
he
drew
a
woman
and
by
the
face
of
her
she
was
old
and
he
was
it
is
not
true
saxon
cried
out
i
have
seen
my
dear
i
know
and
i
tell
you
fear
not
the
wrath
of
god
when
you
are
dead
fear
only
the
salt
vats
and
as
i
stood
and
looked
and
as
he
who
led
me
there
looked
at
me
and
smiled
and
questioned
and
bedeviled
me
with
those
mad
black
eyes
of
his
i
knew
that
that
was
no
way
for
my
dear
clay
dear
it
is
my
clay
to
me
dear
it
has
been
to
others
la
la
the
salt
vat
is
no
place
for
my
kissed
lips
and
mercedes
lifted
the
lid
of
the
chest
and
gazed
fondly
at
her
burial
pretties
so
i
have
made
my
bed
so
i
shall
lie
in
it
some
old
philosopher
said
we
know
we
must
die
we
do
not
believe
it
but
the
old
do
believe
i
believe
my
dear
remember
the
salt
vats
and
do
not
be
angry
with
me
because
my
commissions
have
been
heavy
to
escape
the
vats
i
would
stop
at
nothing
steal
the
widow
mite
the
orphan
crust
and
pennies
from
a
dead
man
do
you
believe
in
god
saxon
asked
abruptly
holding
herself
together
despite
cold
horror
mercedes
dropped
the
lid
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
who
knows
i
shall
rest
and
punishment
saxon
probed
remembering
the
unthinkable
tale
of
the
other
life
impossible
my
dear
as
some
old
poet
said
a
good
fellow
some
time
i
shall
talk
to
you
about
god
never
be
afraid
of
him
be
afraid
only
of
the
salt
vats
and
the
things
men
may
do
with
your
pretty
flesh
after
you
are
chapter
vii
billy
quarreled
with
good
fortune
he
suspected
he
was
too
prosperous
on
the
wages
he
received
what
with
the
accumulating
savings
account
the
paying
of
the
monthly
furniture
installment
and
the
house
rent
the
spending
money
in
pocket
and
the
good
fare
he
was
eating
he
was
puzzled
as
to
how
saxon
managed
to
pay
for
the
goods
used
in
her
fancy
work
several
times
he
had
suggested
his
inability
to
see
how
she
did
it
and
been
baffled
each
time
by
saxon
mysterious
laugh
i
ca
see
how
you
do
it
on
the
money
he
was
contending
one
evening
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
further
then
closed
it
and
for
five
minutes
thought
with
knitted
brows
say
he
said
what
become
of
that
frilly
breakfast
cap

was
workin
on
so
hard
i
ai
never
seen
you
wear
it
and

sure
too
big
for
the
saxon
hesitated
with
pursed
lips
and
teasing
eyes
with
her
untruthfulness
had
always
been
a
difficult
matter
to
billy
it
was
impossible
she
could
see
the
in
his
eyes
deepening
and
his
face
hardening
in
the
way
she
knew
so
well
when
he
was
vexed
say
saxon
you
ai

ai
sellin

thereat
she
related
everything
not
omitting
mercedes
higgins
part
in
the
transaction
nor
mercedes
higgins
remarkable
burial
trousseau
but
billy
was
not
to
be
led
aside
by
the
latter
in
terms
anything
but
uncertain
he
told
saxon
that
she
was
not
to
work
for
money
but
i
have
so
much
spare
time
billy

he
threw
up
his
hands
as
if
despairing
of
ability
to
express
what
he
thought
and
felt
then
essayed
a
further
attempt
it
not
a
matter
of
bein
only
clean
though
that
a
whole
lot
lots
of
women
are
clean

ai
that
it
something

pride
of

that
what

the
united
states

saxon
ultimatum

i
do
drive
bargains
even
if
you
let
me
work
for
money
i
would
let
you

you
told

about

my
silk

i
wo
work

and
more
i
never

to
same
here
billy
agreed
though
just
the
same
i
like
most
to
death
to
have
just
one
go
at
that
squarehead
he
smiled
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
say
let
forget
it
all
now
an
you
sing
me
days
on
that
dinky
when
she
had
complied
accompanying
herself
on
the
ukulele
she
suggested
his
weird
cowboy
in
some
inexplicable
way
of
love
she
had
come
to
like
her
husband
one
song
because
he
sang
it
she
liked
its
inanity
and
monotonousness
and
most
of
all
it
seemed
to
her
she
loved
his
hopeless
and
adorable
flatting
of
every
note
she
could
even
sing
with
him
flatting
as
accurately
and
deliciously
as
he
nor
did
she
undeceive
him
in
his
sublime
faith
i
guess
bert
an
the
rest
have
joshed
me
all
the
time
he
said
you
and
i
get
along
together
with
it
fine
she
equivocated
for
in
such
matters
she
did
not
deem
the
untruth
a
wrong
spring
was
on
when
the
strike
came
in
the
railroad
shops
the
sunday
before
it
was
called
saxon
and
billy
had
dinner
at
bert
house
saxon
brother
came
though
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
bring
sarah
who
refused
to
budge
from
her
household
rut
bert
was
blackly
pessimistic
and
they
found
him
singing
with
sardonic
glee
nobody
loves
a
nobody
likes
his
looks
nobody
share
his
slightest
care
he
classes
with
thugs
and
crooks
thriftiness
has
become
a
crime
so
spend
everything
you
earn
we
living
now
in
a
funny
time
when
money
is
made
to
mary
went
about
the
dinner
preparation
flaunting
unmistakable
signals
of
rebellion
and
saxon
rolling
up
her
sleeves
and
tying
on
an
apron
washed
the
breakfast
dishes
bert
fetched
a
pitcher
of
steaming
beer
from
the
corner
saloon
and
the
three
men
smoked
and
talked
about
the
coming
strike
it
oughta
come
years
ago
was
bert
dictum
it
ca
come
any
too
quick
now
to
suit
me
but
it
too
late
we
beaten
thumbs
down
here
where
the
last
of
the
mohegans
gets
theirs
in
the
neck
oh
i
do
know
tom
who
had
been
smoking
his
pipe
gravely
began
to
counsel
organized
labor
gettin
stronger
every
day
why
i
can
remember
when
there
was
any
unions
in
california
look
at
us
now
wages
an
hours
an
you
talk
like
an
organizer
bert
sneered
shovin
the
bull
con
on
the
boneheads
but
we
know
different
organized
wages
wo
buy
as
much
now
as
unorganized
wages
used
to
buy
they
got
us
whipsawed
look
at
frisco
the
labor
leaders
doin
dirtier
politics
than
the
old
parties
pawin
an
squabblin
over

an
goin
to
san
quentin
while
what
are
the
frisco
carpenters

let
me
tell
you

thing

the
tenderloin
when
they
ai
coughing

up
to
the
lawyers
to

tom
concurred
nobody
denyin
it
the
trouble
is
labor
ai
quite
got
its
eyes
open
it
ought
to
play
politics
but
the
politics

to
be
the
right

bert
caught
him
up
with
scorn
would
they
sell
us
out
just
as
the
ruefs
and
schmidts
have
get
men
that
are
honest
billy
said
that
the
whole
trouble
not

i
stand
for
socialism

do
all
our
folks
was
a
long
time
in
america

a
standstill

there

plenty
for
everybody
and
we
went
on
for
it
i
had
two
uncles
killed
at
gettysburg
all
of
us
was
mixed
up
in
that
war
listen
to
saxon

any
time
what
her

through
to

bert
continued
that
the
very
point
we

losers

ben
robbed
we
could
mark
cards

from
the
bottom
an
ring
in
cold
decks

the
white
folks
that

of
us

plugs
the
plugs

worked
the
lions

they

farms

mines

factories

now
they
gobbled
the
government

the
white
folks
an
the
children

white
folks
that

too
busy
being
good
to
be

good
tom
commended
if
only
you
get
the
kinks

your
it
sounds
all
right
bert
billy
said
only
it
ai
any
man
can
get
rich
or
be
president
of
the
united
states
bert
snapped
sure
thing
if
he
got
it
in
him
just
the
same
i
ai
heard
you
makin
a
noise
like
a
millionaire
or
a
president
why
you
ai
got
it
in
you
you
a
bonehead
a
plug
that
why
skiddoo
for
you
skiddoo
for
all
of
at
the
table
while
they
ate
tom
talked
of
the
joys
of
he
had
known
as
a
boy
and
as
a
young
man
and
confided
that
it
was
his
dream
to
go
and
take
up
government
land
somewhere
as
his
people
had
done
before
him
unfortunately
as
he
explained
sarah
was
set
so
that
the
dream
must
remain
a
dream
it
all
in
the
game
billy
sighed
it
played
to
rules
some
one
has
to
get
knocked
out
i
a
little
later
while
bert
was
off
on
a
fresh
diatribe
billy
became
aware
that
he
was
making
comparisons
this
house
was
not
like
his
house
here
was
no
satisfying
atmosphere
things
seemed
to
run
with
a
jar
he
recollected
that
when
they
arrived
the
breakfast
dishes
had
not
yet
been
washed
with
a
man
general
obliviousness
of
household
affairs
he
had
not
noted
details
yet
it
had
been
borne
in
on
him
all
morning
in
a
myriad
ways
that
mary
was
not
the
housekeeper
saxon
was
he
glanced
proudly
across
at
her
and
felt
the
spur
of
an
impulse
to
leave
his
seat
go
around
and
embrace
her
she
was
a
wife
he
remembered
her
dainty
undergarmenting
and
on
the
instant
into
his
brain
leaped
the
image
of
her
so
appareled
only
to
be
shattered
by
bert
hey
bill
you
seem
to
think
i
got
a
grouch
sure
thing
i
have
you
ai
had
my
experiences
you
always
done
teamin
an
pulled
down

hard
times
you
ai
ben
through
strikes
you
ai
had
to
take
care
of
an
old
mother
an
swallow
dirt
on
her
account
it
was
until
after
she
died
that
i
could
rip
loose
an
take
or
leave
as
i
felt
like
it
take
that
time
i
tackled
the
niles
electric
an
see
what
a
gets
handed
out
to
him
the
head

a
lot
of
questions

me
an
application
blank
i
make
it
out

a
dollar
to
a
doctor
they
sent
me
to
for
a
health
certificate
then
i
got
to
go
to
a
picture
garage
an
get
my
mug
taken
for
the
niles
electric
rogues
gallery
and
i
cough
up
another
dollar
for
the
mug
the
head
squirt
takes
the
blank
the
health
certificate
and
the
mug
an
fires
more
questions
did
i
belong
to
a
labor
union
me
of
course
i
the
truth
i
guess
nit
i
needed
the
job
the
grocery
would
give
me
any
more
tick
and
there
was
my
mother
huh
thinks
i
here
where
i
a
real
carman
back
platform
for
me
where
i
can
pick
up
the
fancy
skirts

two

fifteen
only
that
was
to
be
paid
out
of

and
then

in
change
in
my
pocket
my
own
money
that
was
the
i
borrowed
that
five
from
tom
donovan
the
policeman
then
what
they
worked
me
for
two
weeks
without
pay
breakin
me
did
you
pick
up
any
fancy
skirts
saxon
queried
teasingly
bert
shook
his
head
glumly
i
only
worked
a
month
then
we
organized
and
they
busted
our
union
a
and
you
boobs
in
the
shops
will
be
busted
the
same
way
if
you
go
out
on
strike
mary
informed
him
that
what
i
ben
tellin
you
all
along
bert
replied
we
got
a
chance
to
then
why
go
out
was
saxon
question
he
looked
at
her
with
lackluster
eyes
for
a
moment
then
answered
why
did
my
two
uncles
get
killed
at
gettysburg
chapter
viii
saxon
went
about
her
housework
greatly
troubled
she
no
longer
devoted
herself
to
the
making
of
pretties
the
materials
cost
money
and
she
did
not
dare
bert
thrust
had
sunk
home
it
remained
in
her
quivering
consciousness
like
a
shaft
of
steel
that
ever
turned
and
rankled
she
and
billy
were
responsible
for
this
coming
young
life
could
they
be
sure
after
all
that
they
could
adequately
feed
and
clothe
it
and
prepare
it
for
its
way
in
the
world
where
was
the
guaranty
she
remembered
dimly
the
blight
of
hard
times
in
the
past
and
the
plaints
of
fathers
and
mothers
in
those
days
returned
to
her
with
a
new
significance
almost
could
she
understand
sarah
chronic
complaining
hard
times
were
already
in
the
neighborhood
where
lived
the
families
of
the
shopmen
who
had
gone
out
on
strike
among
the
small
storekeepers
saxon
in
the
course
of
the
daily
marketing
could
sense
the
air
of
despondency
light
and
geniality
seemed
to
have
vanished
gloom
pervaded
everywhere
the
mothers
of
the
children
that
played
in
the
streets
showed
the
gloom
plainly
in
their
faces
when
they
gossiped
in
the
evenings
over
front
gates
and
on
door
stoops
their
voices
were
subdued
and
less
of
laughter
rang
out
mary
donahue
who
had
taken
three
pints
from
the
milkman
now
took
one
pint
there
were
no
more
family
trips
to
the
moving
picture
shows
was
harder
to
get
from
the
butcher
nora
delaney
in
the
third
house
no
longer
bought
fresh
fish
for
friday
salted
codfish
not
of
the
best
quality
was
now
on
her
table
the
sturdy
children
that
ran
out
upon
the
street
between
meals
with
huge
slices
of
bread
and
butter
and
sugar
now
came
out
with
no
sugar
and
with
thinner
slices
spread
more
thinly
with
butter
the
very
custom
was
dying
out
and
some
children
already
had
desisted
from
piecing
between
meals
everywhere
was
manifest
a
pinching
and
scraping
a
tightning
and
shortening
down
of
expenditure
and
everywhere
was
more
irritation
women
became
angered
with
one
another
and
with
the
children
more
quickly
than
of
yore
and
saxon
knew
that
bert
and
mary
bickered
incessantly
if
she
only
realize
i
got
troubles
of
my
own
bert
complained
to
saxon
she
looked
at
him
closely
and
felt
fear
for
him
in
a
vague
numb
way
his
black
eyes
seemed
to
burn
with
a
continuous
madness
the
brown
face
was
leaner
the
skin
drawn
tightly
across
the
cheekbones
a
slight
twist
had
come
to
the
mouth
which
seemed
frozen
into
bitterness
the
very
carriage
of
his
body
and
the
way
he
wore
his
hat
advertised
a
recklessness
more
intense
than
had
been
his
in
the
past
sometimes
in
the
long
afternoons
sitting
by
the
window
with
idle
hands
she
caught
herself
reconstructing
in
her
vision
that
of
her
people
across
the
plains
and
mountains
and
deserts
to
the
sunset
land
by
the
western
sea
and
often
she
found
herself
dreaming
of
the
arcadian
days
of
her
people
when
they
had
not
lived
in
cities
nor
been
vexed
with
labor
unions
and
employers
associations
she
would
remember
the
old
people
tales
of
when
they
shot
or
raised
their
own
meat
grew
their
own
vegetables
were
their
own
blacksmiths
and
carpenters
made
their
own
shoes
yes
and
spun
the
cloth
of
the
clothes
they
wore
and
something
of
the
wistfulness
in
tom
face
she
could
see
as
she
recollected
it
when
he
talked
of
his
dream
of
taking
up
government
land
a
farmer
life
must
be
fine
she
thought
why
was
it
that
people
had
to
live
in
cities
why
had
times
changed
if
there
had
been
enough
in
the
old
days
why
was
there
not
enough
now
why
was
it
necessary
for
men
to
quarrel
and
jangle
and
strike
and
fight
all
about
the
matter
of
getting
work
why
was
there
work
for
all
only
that
morning
and
she
shuddered
with
the
recollection
she
had
seen
two
scabs
on
their
way
to
work
beaten
up
by
the
strikers
by
men
she
knew
by
sight
and
some
by
name
who
lived
in
the
neighhorhood
it
had
happened
directly
across
the
street
it
had
been
cruel
terrible
a
dozen
men
on
two
the
children
had
begun
it
by
throwing
rocks
at
the
scabs
and
cursing
them
in
ways
children
should
not
know
policemen
had
run
upon
the
scene
with
drawn
revolvers
and
the
strikers
had
retreated
into
the
houses
and
through
the
narrow
alleys
between
the
houses
one
of
the
scabs
unconscious
had
been
carried
away
in
an
ambulance
the
other
assisted
by
special
railroad
police
had
been
taken
away
to
the
shops
at
him
mary
donahue
standing
on
her
front
stoop
her
child
in
her
arms
had
hurled
such
vile
abuse
that
it
had
brought
the
blush
of
shame
to
saxon
cheeks
on
the
stoop
of
the
house
on
the
other
side
saxon
had
noted
mercedes
in
the
height
of
the
beating
up
looking
on
with
a
queer
smile
she
had
seemed
very
eager
to
witness
her
nostrils
dilated
and
swelling
like
the
beat
of
pulses
as
she
watched
it
had
struck
saxon
at
the
time
that
the
old
woman
was
quite
unalarmed
and
only
curious
to
see
to
mercedes
who
was
so
wise
in
love
saxon
went
for
explanation
of
what
was
the
matter
with
the
world
but
the
old
woman
wisdom
in
affairs
industrial
and
economic
was
cryptic
and
unpalatable
la
la
my
dear
it
is
so
simple
most
men
are
born
stupid
they
are
the
slaves
a
few
are
born
clever
they
are
the
masters
god
made
men
so
i
then
how
about
god
and
that
terrible
beating
across
the
street
this
morning
i
afraid
he
was
not
interested
mercedes
smiled
i
doubt
he
even
knows
that
it
i
was
frightened
to
death
saxon
declared
i
was
made
sick
by
it
and
yet
you
i
saw
you
you
looked
on
as
cool
as
you
please
as
if
it
was
a
it
was
a
show
my
oh
how
could
you
la
la
i
have
seen
men
killed
it
is
nothing
strange
all
men
die
the
stupid
ones
die
like
oxen
they
know
not
why
it
is
quite
funny
to
see
they
strike
each
other
with
fists
and
clubs
and
break
each
heads
it
is
gross
they
are
like
a
lot
of
animals
they
are
like
dogs
wrangling
over
bones
jobs
are
bones
you
know
now
if
they
fought
for
women
or
ideas
or
bars
of
gold
or
fabulous
diamonds
it
would
be
splendid
but
no
they
are
only
hungry
and
fight
over
scraps
for
their
oh
if
i
could
only
understand
saxon
murmured
her
hands
tightly
clasped
in
anguish
of
incomprehension
and
vital
need
to
know
there
is
nothing
to
understand
it
is
clear
as
print
there
have
always
been
the
stupid
and
the
clever
the
slave
and
the
master
the
peasant
and
the
prince
there
always
will
but
why
why
is
a
peasant
a
peasant
my
dear
because
he
is
a
peasant
why
is
a
flea
a
flea
saxon
tossed
her
head
fretfully
oh
but
my
dear
i
have
answered
the
philosophies
of
the
world
can
give
no
better
answer
why
do
you
like
your
man
for
a
husband
rather
than
any
other
man
because
you
like
him
that
way
that
is
all
why
do
you
like
because
you
like
why
does
fire
burn
and
frost
bite
why
are
there
clever
men
and
stupid
men
masters
and
slaves
employers
and
workingmen
why
is
black
black
answer
that
and
you
answer
but
it
is
not
right
that
men
should
go
hungry
and
without
work
when
they
want
to
work
if
only
they
can
get
a
square
deal
saxon
protested
oh
but
it
is
right
just
as
it
is
right
that
stone
wo
burn
like
wood
that
sea
sand
is
sugar
that
thorns
prick
that
water
is
wet
that
smoke
rises
that
things
fall
down
and
not
but
such
doctrine
of
reality
made
no
impression
on
saxon
frankly
she
could
not
comprehend
it
seemed
like
so
much
nonsense
then
we
have
no
liberty
and
independence
she
cried
passionately
one
man
is
not
as
good
as
another
my
child
has
not
the
right
to
live
that
a
rich
mother
child
certainly
not
mercedes
answered
yet
all
my
people
fought
for
these
things
saxon
urged
remembering
her
school
history
and
the
sword
of
her
father
democracy
the
dream
of
the
stupid
peoples
oh
la
la
my
dear
democracy
is
a
lie
an
enchantment
to
keep
the
work
brutes
content
just
as
religion
used
to
keep
them
content
when
they
groaned
in
their
misery
and
toil
they
were
persuaded
to
keep
on
in
their
misery
and
toil
by
pretty
tales
of
a
land
beyond
the
skies
where
they
would
live
famously
and
fat
while
the
clever
ones
roasted
in
everlasting
fire
ah
how
the
clever
ones
must
have
chuckled
and
when
that
lie
wore
out
and
democracy
was
dreamed
the
clever
ones
saw
to
it
that
it
should
be
in
truth
a
dream
nothing
but
a
dream
the
world
belongs
to
the
great
and
but
you
are
of
the
working
people
saxon
charged
the
old
woman
drew
herself
up
and
almost
was
angry
i
of
the
working
people
my
dear
because
i
had
misfortune
with
moneys
invested
because
i
am
old
and
can
no
longer
win
the
brave
young
men
because
i
have
outlived
the
men
of
my
youth
and
there
is
no
one
to
go
to
because
i
live
here
in
the
ghetto
with
barry
higgins
and
prepare
to
die
why
my
dear
i
was
born
with
the
masters
and
have
trod
all
my
days
on
the
necks
of
the
stupid
i
have
drunk
rare
wines
and
sat
at
feasts
that
would
have
supported
this
neighborhood
for
a
lifetime
dick
golden
and
i
it
was
dickie
money
but
i
could
have
had
it
dick
golden
and
i
dropped
four
hundred
thousand
francs
in
a
week
play
at
monte
carlo
he
was
a
jew
but
he
was
a
spender
in
india
i
have
worn
jewels
that
could
have
saved
the
lives
of
ten
thousand
families
dying
before
my
you
saw
them
die
and
did
nothing
saxon
asked
aghast
i
kept
my
jewels
la
la
and
was
robbed
of
them
by
a
brute
of
a
russian
officer
within
the
and
you
let
them
die
saxon
reiterated
they
were
cheap
spawn
they
fester
and
multiply
like
maggots
they
meant
nothing
nothing
my
dear
nothing
no
more
than
your
work
people
mean
here
whose
crowning
stupidity
is
their
continuing
to
beget
more
stupid
spawn
for
the
slavery
of
the
so
it
was
that
while
saxon
could
get
little
glimmering
of
common
sense
from
others
from
the
terrible
old
woman
she
got
none
at
all
nor
could
saxon
bring
herself
to
believe
much
of
what
she
considered
romancing
as
the
weeks
passed
the
strike
in
the
railroad
shops
grew
bitter
and
deadly
billy
shook
his
head
and
confessed
his
inability
to
make
head
or
tail
of
the
troubles
that
were
looming
on
the
labor
horizon
i
do
get
the
hang
of
it
he
told
saxon
it
a
it
like
a
roughhouse
with
the
lights
out
look
at
us
teamsters
here
we
are
the
talk
just
starting
of
going
out
on
sympathetic
strike
for
the
they
ben
out
a
week
most
of
their
places
is
filled
an
if
us
teamsters
keep
on
haulin
the
the
strike
yet
you
did
consider
striking
for
yourselves
when
your
wages
were
cut
saxon
said
with
a
frown
oh
we
was
in
position
then
but
now
the
frisco
teamsters
and
the
whole
frisco
water
front
confederation
is
liable
to
back
us
up
anyway
we
just
talkin
about
it
that
all
but
if
we
do
go
out
we
try
to
get
back
that
ten
per
cent
it
rotten
politics
he
said
another
time
everybody
rotten
if
we
only
wise
up
and
agree
to
pick
out
honest
men
but
if
you
and
bert
and
tom
ca
agree
how
do
you
expect
all
the
rest
to
agree
saxon
asked
it
gets
me
he
admitted
it
enough
to
give
a
guy
the
willies
thinkin
about
it
and
yet
it
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
get
honest
men
for
politics
an
the
whole
thing
straightened
out
honest
men
make
honest
laws
an
then
honest
men
get
their
dues
but
bert
wants
to
smash
things
an
tom
smokes
his
pipe
and
dreams
pipe
dreams
about
by
an
by
when
everybody
votes
the
way
he
thinks
but
this
by
by
ai
the
point
we
want
things
now
tom
says
we
ca
get
them
now
an
bert
says
we
ai
never
goin
to
get
them
what
can
a
fellow
do
when
everybody
of
different
minds
look
at
the
socialists
themselves
they
always
disagreeing
splittin
up
an
firin
each
other
out
of
the
party
the
whole
thing
bughouse
that
what
an
i
almost
get
dippy
myself
thinkin
about
it
the
point
i
ca
get
out
of
my
mind
is
that
we
want
things
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
stared
at
saxon
what
is
it
he
asked
his
voice
husky
with
anxiety
you
ai
sick
or
or
anything
one
hand
she
had
pressed
to
her
heart
but
the
startle
and
fright
in
her
eyes
was
changing
into
a
pleased
intentness
while
on
her
mouth
was
a
little
mysterious
smile
she
seemed
oblivious
to
her
husband
as
if
listening
to
some
message
from
afar
and
not
for
his
ears
then
wonder
and
joy
transfused
her
face
and
she
looked
at
billy
and
her
hand
went
out
to
his
it
life
she
whispered
i
felt
life
i
am
so
glad
so
the
next
evening
when
billy
came
home
from
work
saxon
caused
him
to
know
and
undertake
more
of
the
responsibilities
of
fatherhood
i
been
thinking
it
over
billy
she
began
and
i
such
a
healthy
strong
woman
that
it
wo
have
to
be
very
expensive
there
martha
skelton
she
a
good
but
billy
shook
his
head
nothin
doin
in
that
line
saxon
you
goin
to
have
doc
hentley
he
bill
murphy
doc
an
bill
swears
by
him
he
an
old
cuss
but
he
a
she
confined
maggie
donahue
saxon
argued
and
look
at
her
and
her
well
she
wo
confine
you
not
so
as
you
can
notice
but
the
doctor
will
charge
twenty
dollars
saxon
pursued
and
make
me
get
a
nurse
because
i
have
any
womenfolk
to
come
in
but
martha
skelton
would
do
everything
and
it
would
be
so
much
but
billy
gathered
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
laid
down
the
law
listen
to
me
little
wife
the
roberts
family
ai
on
the
cheap
never
forget
that
you
got
ta
have
the
baby
that
your
business
an
enough
for
you
my
business
is
to
get
the
money
an
take
care
of
you
an
the
best
ai
none
too
good
for
you
why
i
would
run
the
chance
of
the
teeniest
accident
happenin
to
you
for
a
million
dollars
you
that
counts
an
dollars
is
dirt
maybe
you
think
i
like
that
kid
some
i
do
why
i
ca
get
him
outa
my
head
i
thinkin
about
all
day
long
if
i
get
fired
it
be
his
fault
i
clean
dotty
over
him
but
just
the
same
saxon
honest
to
god
before
i
have
anything
happen
to
you
break
your
little
finger
even
i
see
him
dead
an
buried
first
that
give
you
something
of
an
idea
what
you
mean
to
me
why
saxon
i
had
the
idea
that
when
folks
got
married
they
just
settled
down
and
after
a
while
their
business
was
to
get
along
with
each
other
maybe
it
the
way
it
is
with
other
people
but
it
that
way
with
you
an
me
i
love
you
more
more
every
day
right
now
i
love
you
when
i
began
talkin
to
you
five
minutes
ago
an
you
wo
have
to
get
a
nurse
doc
hentley
come
every
day
an
come
in
an
do
the
housework
an
take
care
of
you
an
all
that
just
as
you
do
for
her
if
she
ever
needs
as
the
days
and
weeks
passed
saxon
was
possessed
by
a
conscious
feeling
of
proud
motherhood
in
her
swelling
breasts
so
essentially
a
normal
woman
was
she
that
motherhood
was
a
satisfying
and
passionate
happiness
it
was
true
that
she
had
her
moments
of
apprehension
but
they
were
so
momentary
and
faint
that
they
tended
if
anything
to
give
zest
to
her
happiness
only
one
thing
troubled
her
and
that
was
the
puzzling
and
perilous
situation
of
labor
which
no
one
seemed
to
understand
her
self
least
of
all
they
always
talking
about
how
much
more
is
made
by
machinery
than
by
the
old
ways
she
told
her
brother
tom
then
with
all
the
machinery
we
got
now
why
do
we
get
more
now
you
talkin
he
answered
it
would
take
you
long
to
understand
but
saxon
had
a
mind
to
the
immediate
need
of
things
tom
how
long
have
you
been
a
socialist
eight
and
you
have
got
anything
by
it
but
we
will
in
at
that
rate
you
be
dead
first
she
challenged
tom
sighed
i
afraid
so
things
move
so
again
he
sighed
she
noted
the
weary
patient
look
in
his
face
the
bent
shoulders
the
hands
and
it
all
seemed
to
symbolize
the
futility
of
his
social
creed
chapter
ix
it
began
quietly
as
the
fateful
unexpected
so
often
begins
children
of
all
ages
and
sizes
were
playing
in
the
street
and
saxon
by
the
open
front
window
was
watching
them
and
dreaming
day
dreams
of
her
child
soon
to
be
the
sunshine
mellowed
peacefully
down
and
a
light
wind
from
the
bay
cooled
the
air
and
gave
to
it
a
tang
of
salt
one
of
the
children
pointed
up
pine
street
toward
seventh
all
the
children
ceased
playing
and
stared
and
pointed
they
formed
into
groups
the
larger
boys
of
from
ten
to
twelve
by
themselves
the
older
girls
anxiously
clutching
the
small
children
by
the
hands
or
gathering
them
into
their
arms
saxon
could
not
see
the
cause
of
all
this
but
she
could
guess
when
she
saw
the
larger
boys
rush
to
the
gutter
pick
up
stones
and
sneak
into
the
alleys
between
the
houses
smaller
boys
tried
to
imitate
them
the
girls
dragging
the
tots
by
the
arms
banged
gates
and
clattered
up
the
front
steps
of
the
small
houses
the
doors
slammed
behind
them
and
the
street
was
deserted
though
here
and
there
front
shades
were
drawn
aside
so
that
women
might
peer
forth
saxon
heard
the
uptown
train
puffing
and
snorting
as
it
pulled
out
from
center
street
then
from
the
direction
of
seventh
came
a
hoarse
throaty
manroar
still
she
could
see
nothing
and
she
remembered
mercedes
higgins
words
they
are
like
dogs
wrangling
over
bones
jobs
are
bones
you
the
roar
came
closer
and
saxon
leaning
out
saw
a
dozen
scabs
conveyed
by
as
many
special
police
and
pinkertons
coming
down
the
sidewalk
on
her
side
of
the
street
they
came
compactly
as
if
with
discipline
while
behind
disorderly
yelling
confusedly
stooping
to
pick
up
rocks
were
or
a
hundred
of
the
striking
shopmen
saxon
discovered
herself
trembling
with
apprehension
knew
that
she
must
not
and
controlled
herself
she
was
helped
in
this
by
the
conduct
of
mercedes
higgins
the
old
woman
came
out
of
her
front
door
dragging
a
chair
on
which
she
coolly
seated
herself
on
the
tiny
stoop
at
the
top
of
the
steps
in
the
hands
of
the
special
police
were
clubs
the
pinkertons
carried
no
visible
weapons
the
strikers
urging
on
from
behind
seemed
content
with
yelling
their
rage
and
threats
and
it
remained
for
the
children
to
precipitate
the
conflict
from
across
the
street
between
the
olsen
and
the
isham
houses
came
a
shower
of
stones
most
of
these
fell
short
though
one
struck
a
scab
on
the
head
the
man
was
no
more
than
twenty
feet
away
from
saxon
he
reeled
toward
her
front
picket
fence
drawing
a
revolver
with
one
hand
he
brushed
the
blood
from
his
eyes
and
with
the
other
he
discharged
the
revolver
into
the
isham
house
a
pinkerton
seized
his
arm
to
prevent
a
second
shot
and
dragged
him
along
at
the
same
instant
a
wilder
roar
went
up
from
the
strikers
while
a
volley
of
stones
came
from
between
saxon
house
and
maggie
donahue
the
scabs
and
their
protectors
made
a
stand
drawing
revolvers
from
their
hard
determined
faces
fighting
men
by
profession
saxon
could
augur
nothing
but
bloodshed
and
death
an
elderly
man
evidently
the
leader
lifted
a
soft
felt
hat
and
mopped
the
perspiration
from
the
bald
top
of
his
head
he
was
a
large
man
very
rotund
of
belly
and
helpless
looking
his
gray
beard
was
stained
with
streaks
of
tobacco
juice
and
he
was
smoking
a
cigar
he
was
and
saxon
noted
the
dandruff
on
the
collar
of
his
coat
one
of
the
men
pointed
into
the
street
and
several
of
his
companions
laughed
the
cause
of
it
was
the
little
olsen
boy
barely
four
years
old
escaped
somehow
from
his
mother
and
toddling
toward
his
economic
enemies
in
his
right
he
bore
a
rock
so
heavy
that
he
could
scarcely
lift
it
with
this
he
feebly
threatened
them
his
rosy
little
face
was
convulsed
with
rage
and
he
was
screaming
over
and
over
dam
scabs
dam
scabs
dam
scabs
the
laughter
with
which
they
greeted
him
only
increased
his
fury
he
toddled
closer
and
with
a
mighty
exertion
threw
the
rock
it
fell
a
scant
six
feet
beyond
his
hand
this
much
saxon
saw
and
also
olsen
rushing
into
the
street
for
her
child
a
rattling
of
from
the
strikers
drew
attention
to
the
men
beneath
her
one
of
them
cursed
sharply
and
examined
the
biceps
of
his
left
arm
which
hung
limply
by
his
side
down
the
hand
she
saw
the
blood
beginning
to
drip
she
knew
she
ought
not
remain
and
watch
but
the
memory
of
her
fighting
forefathers
was
with
her
while
she
possessed
no
more
than
normal
human
fear
if
anything
less
she
forgot
her
child
in
the
eruption
of
battle
that
had
broken
upon
her
quiet
street
and
she
forgot
the
strikers
and
everything
else
in
amazement
at
what
had
happened
to
the
leader
in
some
strange
way
she
knew
not
how
his
head
had
become
wedged
at
the
neck
between
the
tops
of
the
pickets
of
her
fence
his
body
hung
down
outside
the
knees
not
quite
touching
the
ground
his
hat
had
fallen
off
and
the
sun
was
making
an
astounding
high
light
on
his
bald
spot
the
cigar
too
was
gone
she
saw
he
was
looking
at
her
one
hand
between
the
pickets
seemed
waving
at
her
and
almost
he
seemed
to
wink
at
her
jocosely
though
she
knew
it
to
be
the
contortion
of
deadly
pain
possibly
a
second
or
at
most
two
seconds
she
gazed
at
this
when
she
was
aroused
by
bert
voice
he
was
running
along
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
her
house
and
behind
him
charged
several
more
strikers
while
he
shouted
come
on
you
mohegans
we
got
nailed
to
the
cross
in
his
left
hand
he
carried
a
in
his
right
a
revolver
already
empty
for
he
clicked
the
cylinder
vainly
around
as
he
ran
with
an
abrupt
stop
dropping
the
he
whirled
half
about
facing
saxon
gate
he
was
sinking
down
when
he
straightened
himself
to
throw
the
revolver
into
the
face
of
a
scab
who
was
jumping
toward
him
then
he
began
swaying
at
the
same
time
sagging
at
the
knees
and
waist
slowly
with
infinite
effort
he
caught
a
gate
picket
in
his
right
hand
and
still
slowly
as
if
lowering
himself
sank
down
while
past
him
leaped
the
crowd
of
strikers
he
had
led
it
was
battle
without
quarter
a
massacre
the
scabs
and
their
protectors
surrounded
backed
against
saxon
fence
fought
like
cornered
rats
but
could
not
withstand
the
rush
of
a
hundred
men
clubs
and
were
swinging
revolvers
were
exploding
and
cobblestones
were
flung
with
crushing
effect
at
arm
distance
saxon
saw
young
frank
davis
a
friend
of
bert
and
a
father
of
several
months
standing
press
the
muzzle
of
his
revolver
against
a
stomach
and
fire
there
were
curses
and
snarls
of
rage
wild
cries
of
terror
and
pain
mercedes
was
right
these
things
were
not
men
they
were
beasts
fighting
over
bones
destroying
one
another
for
bones
jobs
are
bones
jobs
are
bones
the
phrase
was
an
incessant
iteration
in
saxon
brain
much
as
she
might
have
wished
it
she
was
powerless
now
to
withdraw
from
the
window
it
was
as
if
she
were
paralyzed
her
brain
no
longer
worked
she
sat
numb
staring
incapable
of
anything
save
seeing
the
rapid
horror
before
her
eyes
that
flashed
along
like
a
moving
picture
film
gone
mad
she
saw
pinkertons
special
police
and
strikers
go
down
one
scab
terribly
wounded
on
his
knees
and
begging
for
mercy
was
kicked
in
the
face
as
he
sprawled
backward
another
striker
standing
over
him
fired
a
revolver
into
his
chest
quickly
and
deliberately
again
and
again
until
the
weapon
was
empty
another
scab
backed
over
the
pickets
by
a
hand
clutching
his
throat
had
his
face
pulped
by
a
revolver
butt
again
and
again
continually
the
revolver
rose
and
fell
and
saxon
knew
the
man
who
wielded
it
chester
johnson
she
had
met
him
at
dances
and
danced
with
him
in
the
days
before
she
was
married
he
had
always
been
kind
and
good
natured
she
remembered
the
friday
night
after
a
city
hall
band
concert
when
he
had
taken
her
and
two
other
girls
to
tony
tamale
grotto
on
thirteenth
street
and
after
that
they
had
all
gone
to
pabst
cafe
and
drunk
a
glass
of
beer
before
they
went
home
it
was
impossible
that
this
could
be
the
same
chester
johnson
and
as
she
looked
she
saw
the
leader
still
wedged
by
the
neck
between
the
pickets
draw
a
revolver
with
his
free
hand
and
squinting
horribly
sidewise
press
the
muzzle
against
chester
side
she
tried
to
scream
a
warning
she
did
scream
and
chester
looked
up
and
saw
her
at
that
moment
the
revolver
went
off
and
he
collapsed
prone
upon
the
body
of
the
scab
and
the
bodies
of
three
men
hung
on
her
picket
fence
anything
could
happen
now
quite
without
surprise
she
saw
the
strikers
leaping
the
fence
trampling
her
few
little
geraniums
and
pansies
into
the
earth
as
they
fled
between
mercedes
house
and
hers
up
pine
street
from
the
railroad
yards
was
coming
a
rush
of
railroad
police
and
pinkertons
firing
as
they
ran
while
down
pine
street
gongs
clanging
horses
at
a
gallop
came
three
patrol
wagons
packed
with
police
the
strikers
were
in
a
trap
the
only
way
out
was
between
the
houses
and
over
the
back
yard
fences
the
jam
in
the
narrow
alley
prevented
them
all
from
escaping
a
dozen
were
cornered
in
the
angle
between
the
front
of
her
house
and
the
steps
and
as
they
had
done
so
were
they
done
by
no
effort
was
made
to
arrest
they
were
clubbed
down
and
shot
down
to
the
last
man
by
the
guardians
of
the
peace
who
were
infuriated
by
what
had
been
wreaked
on
their
brethren
it
was
all
over
and
saxon
moving
as
in
a
dream
clutching
the
banister
tightly
came
down
the
front
steps
the
leader
still
leered
at
her
and
fluttered
one
hand
though
two
big
policemen
were
just
bending
to
extricate
him
the
gate
was
off
its
hinges
which
seemed
strange
for
she
had
been
watching
all
the
time
and
had
not
seen
it
happen
bert
eyes
were
closed
his
lips
were
and
there
was
a
gurgling
in
his
throat
as
if
he
were
trying
to
say
something
as
she
stooped
above
him
with
her
handkerchief
brushing
the
blood
from
his
cheek
where
some
one
had
stepped
on
him
his
eyes
opened
the
old
defiant
light
was
in
them
he
did
not
know
her
the
lips
moved
and
faintly
almost
reminiscently
he
murmured
the
last
of
the
mohegans
the
last
of
the
then
he
groaned
and
the
eyelids
drooped
down
again
he
was
not
dead
she
knew
that
the
chest
still
rose
and
fell
and
the
gurgling
still
continued
in
his
throat
she
looked
up
mercedes
stood
beside
her
the
old
woman
eyes
were
very
bright
her
withered
cheeks
flushed
will
you
help
me
carry
him
into
the
house
saxon
asked
mercedes
nodded
turned
to
a
sergeant
of
police
and
made
the
request
to
him
the
sergeant
gave
a
swift
glance
at
bert
and
his
eyes
were
bitter
and
ferocious
as
he
refused
to
hell
with
we
care
for
our
maybe
you
and
i
can
do
it
saxon
said
do
be
a
mercedes
was
beckoning
to
olsen
across
the
street
you
go
into
the
house
little
mother
that
is
to
be
this
is
bad
for
you
we
carry
him
in
olsen
is
coming
and
we
get
maggie
saxon
led
the
way
into
the
back
bedroom
which
billy
had
insisted
on
furnishing
as
she
opened
the
door
the
carpet
seemed
to
fly
up
into
her
face
as
with
the
force
of
a
blow
for
she
remembered
bert
had
laid
that
carpet
and
as
the
women
placed
him
on
the
bed
she
recalled
that
it
was
bert
and
she
between
them
who
had
set
the
bed
up
one
sunday
morning
and
then
she
felt
very
queer
and
was
surprised
to
see
mercedes
regarding
her
with
questioning
searching
eyes
after
that
her
queerness
came
on
very
fast
and
she
descended
into
the
hell
of
pain
that
is
given
to
women
alone
to
know
she
was
supported
to
the
front
bedroom
many
faces
were
about
her
mercedes
olsen
maggie
donahue
it
seemed
she
must
ask
olsen
if
she
had
saved
little
emil
from
the
street
but
mercedes
cleared
olsen
out
to
look
after
bert
and
maggie
donahue
went
to
answer
a
knock
at
the
front
door
from
the
street
came
a
loud
hum
of
voices
punctuated
by
shouts
and
commands
and
from
time
to
time
there
was
a
clanging
of
the
gongs
of
ambulances
and
patrol
wagons
then
appeared
the
fat
comfortable
face
of
martha
shelton
and
later
hentley
came
once
in
a
clear
interval
through
the
thin
wall
saxon
heard
the
high
opening
notes
of
hysteria
and
another
time
she
heard
mary
repeating
over
and
over
i
never
go
back
to
the
laundry
never
chapter
x
billy
could
never
get
over
the
shock
during
that
period
of
appearance
morning
after
morning
and
evening
after
evening
when
he
came
home
from
work
he
would
enter
the
room
where
she
lay
and
fight
a
royal
battle
to
hide
his
feelings
and
make
a
show
of
cheerfulness
and
geniality
she
looked
so
small
lying
there
so
small
and
shrunken
and
weary
and
yet
so
in
her
smallness
tenderly
as
he
sat
beside
her
he
would
take
up
her
pale
hand
and
stroke
the
slim
transparent
arm
marveling
at
the
smallness
and
delicacy
of
the
bones
one
of
her
first
questions
puzzling
alike
to
billy
and
mary
was
did
they
save
little
emil
olsen
and
when
she
told
them
how
he
had
attacked
singlehanded
the
whole
fighting
men
billy
face
glowed
with
appreciation
the
little
cuss
he
said
that
the
kind
of
a
kid
to
be
proud
he
halted
awkwardly
and
his
very
evident
fear
that
he
had
hurt
her
touched
saxon
she
put
her
hand
out
to
his
billy
she
began
then
waited
till
mary
left
the
room
i
never
asked
before
not
that
it
matters
now
but
i
waited
for
you
to
tell
me
was
it
he
shook
his
head
no
it
was
a
girl
a
perfect
little
girl
only
it
was
too
she
pressed
his
hand
and
almost
it
was
she
that
sympathized
with
him
in
his
affliction
i
never
told
you
billy
you
were
so
set
on
a
boy
but
i
planned
just
the
same
if
it
was
a
girl
to
call
her
daisy
you
remember
that
was
my
mother
he
nodded
his
approbation
say
saxon
you
know
i
did
want
a
boy
like
the
very
dickens
well
i
do
care

a
girl

would
mind
would
you
what
if
we
called
it
the
same
name

was
thinking
the
very
same
then
his
face
grew
stern
as
he
went
on
only
there
ai
goin
to
be
a
next
i
did
know
what
havin
children
was
like
before
you
ca
run
any
more
risks
like
hear
the
big
strong
talk
she
jeered
with
a
wan
smile
you
do
know
anything
about
it
how
can
a
man
i
am
a
healthy
natural
woman
everything
would
have
been
all
right
this
time
if
if
all
that
fighting
had
happened
where
did
they
bury
bert
you

all
the
time
and
where

been
in
for
two
old
barry

not
tell
her
that
the
old
night
watchman
was
dying
two
thin
walls
and
half
a
dozen
feet
away
saxon
lips
were
trembling
and
she
began
to
cry
weakly
clinging
to
billy
hand
with
both
of
hers
i
i
ca
help
it
she
sobbed
i
be
all
right
in
a
minute
our
little
girl
billy
think
of
it
and
i
never
saw
her
she
was
still
lying
on
her
bed
when
one
evening
mary
saw
fit
to
break
out
in
bitter
thanksgiving
that
she
had
escaped
and
was
destined
to
escape
what
saxon
had
gone
through
aw
what
are

talkin
about
billy

married
some
time
again

best
man
living
she
proclaimed
and
there
ai
no
call
for
it
there
too
many
people
in
the
world
now
else
why
are
there
two
or
three
men
for
every
job
and
besides
havin
children
is
too
saxon
with
a
look
of
patient
wisdom
in
her
face
that
became
glorified
as
she
spoke
made
answer
i
ought
to
know
what
it
means
i
been
through
it
and
i
still
in
the
thick
of
it
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
right
now
out
of
all
the
pain
and
the
ache
and
the
sorrow
that
it
is
the
most
beautiful
wonderful
thing
in
the
as
saxon
strength
came
back
to
her
and
when
doctor
hentley
had
privily
assured
billy
that
she
was
sound
as
a
dollar
she
herself
took
up
the
matter
of
the
industrial
tragedy
that
had
taken
place
before
her
door
the
militia
had
been
called
out
immediately
billy
informed
her
and
was
encamped
then
at
the
foot
of
pine
street
on
the
waste
ground
next
to
the
railroad
yards
as
for
the
strikers
fifteen
of
them
were
in
jail
a
house
to
house
search
had
been
made
in
the
neighborhood
by
the
police
and
in
this
way
nearly
the
whole
fifteen
all
wounded
had
been
captured
it
would
go
hard
with
them
billy
foreboded
gloomily
the
newspapers
were
demanding
blood
for
blood
and
all
the
ministers
in
oakland
had
preached
fierce
sermons
against
the
strikers
the
railroad
had
filled
every
place
and
it
was
well
known
that
the
striking
shopmen
not
only
would
never
get
their
old
jobs
back
but
were
blacklisted
in
every
railroad
in
the
united
states
already
they
were
beginning
to
scatter
a
number
had
gone
to
panama
and
four
were
talking
of
going
to
ecuador
to
work
in
the
shops
of
the
railroad
that
ran
over
the
andes
to
quito
with
anxiety
keenly
concealed
she
tried
to
feel
out
billy
opinion
on
what
had
happened
that
shows
what
bert
violent
methods
come
to
she
said
he
shook
his
head
slowly
and
gravely
they
hang
chester
johnson
anyway
he
answered
indirectly
you
know
him

told
me

to
dance

was
caught
lyin
on
the
body
of
a

our
saxon

jelly

the
bald
spot
and
the
whiskers

said
i
saw
it

it
seemed
he
must
have
hung
there
for
it
was
all
over
from
first
to
last
in
five
it
seemed
ages
and
i
guess
that
the
way
it
seemed
to
jelly
belly
stuck
on
the
pickets
billy
smiled
grimly
but
he
a
hard
one
to
kill

shot

up
a
dozen
different
times
but
they
say

crutches
or
in
a
that
stop
him
from
doin
any
more
dirty
work
for
the
railroad
he
was
one
of
their
top
always
up
to
his
ears
in
the
thick
of
any
that
was
goin
on
he
never
was
leery
of
anything
on
two
feet
i
say
that
much
where

on
adeline

he
must
pay
thirty
dollars
a
month
rent
i
guess
the
railroad
paid
him
pretty
then
he
must
be
married
yep
i
never
seen
his
wife
but
he
got
one
son
jack
a
passenger
engineer
i
used
to
know
him
he
was
a
nifty
boxer
though
he
never
went
into
the
ring
an
he
got
another
son
that
teacher
in
the
high
school
his
name
paul
we
about
the
same
age
he
was
great
at
baseball
i
knew
him
when
we
was
kids
he
pitched
me
out
three
times
once
when
the
durant
played
the
cole
saxon
sat
back
in
the
morris
chair
resting
and
thinking
the
problem
was
growing
more
complicated
than
ever
this
elderly
and
gunfighter
too
had
a
wife
and
family
and
there
was
frank
davis
married
barely
a
year
and
with
a
baby
boy
perhaps
the
scab
he
shot
in
the
stomach
had
a
wife
and
children
all
seemed
to
be
acquainted
members
of
a
very
large
family
and
yet
because
of
their
particular
families
they
battered
and
killed
each
other
she
had
seen
chester
johnson
kill
a
scab
and
now
they
were
going
to
hang
chester
johnson
who
had
married
kittie
brady
out
of
the
cannery
and
she
and
kittie
brady
had
worked
together
years
before
in
the
paper
box
factory
vainly
saxon
waited
for
billy
to
say
something
that
would
show
he
did
not
countenance
the
killing
of
the
scabs
it
was
wrong
she
ventured
finally
they
killed
bert
he
countered
an
a
lot
of
others
an
frank
davis
did
you
know
he
was
dead
had
his
whole
lower
jaw
shot
away
died
in
the
ambulance
before
they
could
get
him
to
the
receiving
hospital
there
was
never
so
much
killin
at
one
time
in
oakland
but
it
was
their
fault
she
contended
they
began
it
it
was
billy
did
not
reply
but
she
heard
him
mutter
hoarsely
she
knew
he
said
god
damn
them
but
when
she
asked
what
he
made
no
answer
his
eyes
were
deep
with
troubled
clouds
while
the
mouth
had
hardened
and
all
his
face
was
bleak
to
her
it
was
a
was
he
too
like
the
rest
would
he
kill
other
men
who
had
families
like
bert
and
frank
davis
and
chester
johnson
had
killed
was
he
too
a
wild
beast
a
dog
that
would
snarl
over
a
bone
she
sighed
life
was
a
strange
puzzle
perhaps
mercedes
higgins
was
right
in
her
cruel
statement
of
the
terms
of
existence
what
of
it
billy
laughed
harshly
as
if
in
answer
to
her
unuttered
questions
it
dog
eat
dog
i
guess
and
it
always
ben
that
way
take
that
scrap
outside
there
they
killed
each
other
just
like
the
north
an
south
did
in
the
civil
but
workingmen
ca
win
that
way
billy
you
say
yourself
that
it
spoiled
their
chance
of
i
suppose
not
he
admitted
reluctantly
but
what
other
chance
got
to
win
i
do
see
look
at
we
be
up
against
it
not
the
teamsters
she
cried
he
nodded
gloomily
the
bosses
are
cuttin
loose
all
along
the
line
for
a
high
old
time
say
they
goin
to
beat
us
to
our
knees
till
we
come
crawlin
back
for
our
jobs
they
bucked
up
real
high
an
mighty
what
of
all
that
killin
the
other
day
havin
the
troops
out
is
half
the
fight
along
with
havin
the
preachers
an
the
papers
an
the
public
behind
they
shootin
off
their
mouths
already
about
what
they
to
do
they
sure
gunning
for
trouble
first
they
goin
to
hang
chester
johnson
an
as
many
more
of
the
fifteen
as
they
can
they
say
that
flat
the
tribune
an
the
enquirer
an
the
times
keep
sayin
it
over
an
over
every
day
they
all
to
beat
the
band
no
more
closed
shop
to
hell
with
organized
labor
why
the
dirty
little
intelligencer
come
out
this
morning
an
said
that
every
union
official
in
oakland
ought
to
be
run
outa
town
or
stretched
up
fine
eh
you
bet
it
fine
look
at
us
it
ai
a
case
any
more
of
sympathetic
strike
for
the
we
got
our
own
troubles
they
fired
our
four
best
men
the
ones
that
was
always
on
the
conference
committees
did
it
without
cause
they
lookin
for
trouble
as
i
told
you
an
get
it
too
if
they
do
watch
out
we
got
our
tip
from
the
frisco
water
front
confederation
with
them
backin
us
we
go
you
mean
you
strike
saxon
asked
he
bent
his
head
but
is
that
what
they
want
you
to
do
from
the
way
they
acting
what
the
difference
billy
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
continued
it
better
to
strike
than
to
get
fired
we
beat
to
it
that
all
an
we
catch
before
they
ready
do
we
know
what
they
doin
they
collectin
drivers
an
all
up
an
down
the
state
they
got
forty
of
feedin
in
a
hotel
in
stockton
right
now
an
ready
to
rush
in
on
us
an
hundreds
more
like
so
this
saturday
the
last
wages
i
likely
bring
home
for
some
saxon
closed
her
eyes
and
thought
quietly
for
five
minutes
it
was
not
her
way
to
take
things
excitedly
the
coolness
of
poise
that
billy
so
admired
never
deserted
her
in
time
of
emergency
she
realized
that
she
herself
was
no
more
than
a
mote
caught
up
in
this
tangled
nonunderstandable
conflict
of
many
motes
we
have
to
draw
from
our
savings
to
pay
for
this
month
rent
she
said
brightly
billy
face
fell
we
ai
got
as
much
in
the
bank
as
you
think
he
confessed
bert
had
to
be
buried
you
know
an
i
coughed
up
what
the
others
could
how
much
was
it
forty
dollars
i
was
goin
to
stand
off
the
butcher
an
the
rest
for
a
while
they
knew
i
was
good
pay
but
they
put
it
to
me
straight
been
carryin
the
shopmen
right
along
an
was
up
against
it
themselves
an
now
with
that
strike
smashed
they
pretty
much
smashed
themselves
so
i
took
it
all
out
of
the
bank
i
knew
you
would
mind
you
do
do
you
she
smiled
bravely
and
bravely
overcame
the
sinking
feeling
at
her
heart
it
was
the
only
right
thing
to
do
billy
i
would
have
done
it
if
you
were
lying
sick
and
bert
would
have
done
it
for
you
an
me
if
it
had
been
the
other
way
his
face
was
glowing
gee
saxon
a
fellow
can
always
count
on
you
you
like
my
right
hand
that
why
i
say
no
more
babies
if
i
lose
you
i
crippled
for
we
got
to
economize
she
mused
nodding
her
appreciation
how
much
is
in
bank
just
about
thirty
dollars
you
see
i
had
to
pay
martha
skelton
an
for
the
a
few
other
little
things
an
the
union
took
time
by
the
neck
and
levied
a
four
dollar
emergency
assessment
on
every
member
just
to
be
ready
if
the
strike
was
pulled
off
but
doc
hentley
can
wait
he
said
as
much
he
the
goods
if
anybody
should
ask
you
how
you
like
i
liked
him
but
i
do
know
about
doctors
he
the
first
i
ever
had
except
when
i
was
vaccinated
once
and
then
the
city
did
looks
like
the
street
car
men
are
goin
out
too
dan
fallon
come
to
town
came
all
the
way
from
new
york
tried
to
sneak
in
on
the
quiet
but
the
fellows
knew
when
he
left
new
york
an
kept
track
of
him
all
the
way
acrost
they
have
to
he
whenever
street
car
men
are
licked
into
shape
he
won
lots
of
street
car
strikes
for
the
bosses
keeps
an
army
of
strike
breakers
an
ships
them
all
over
the
country
on
special
trains
wherever
they
needed
oakland
never
seen
labor
troubles
like
she
got
and
is
goin
to
get
all
hell
goin
to
break
loose
from
the
looks
of
watch
out
for
yourself
then
billy
i
do
want
to
lose
you
aw
that
all
right
i
can
take
care
of
myself
an
besides
it
as
though
we
was
licked
we
got
a
good
but
you
lose
if
there
is
any
yep
we
got
ta
keep
an
eye
out
against
no
no
or
dynamite
he
assented
but
a
heap
of
scabs
get
their
heads
broke
that
has
to
but
you
wo
do
any
of
that
not
so
as
any
slob
can
testify
before
a
court
to
havin
seen
then
with
a
quick
shift
he
changed
the
subject
old
barry
higgins
is
dead
i
did
want
to
tell
you
till
you
was
outa
bed
buried
a
week
ago
an
the
old
woman
movin
to
frisco
she
told
me
she
be
in
to
say
she
stuck
by
you
pretty
well
them
first
couple
of
days
an
she
showed
martha
shelton
a
few
that
made
her
hair
curl
she
got
martha
goat
from
the
chapter
xi
with
billy
on
strike
and
away
doing
picket
duty
and
with
the
departure
of
mercedes
and
the
death
of
bert
saxon
was
left
much
to
herself
in
a
loneliness
that
even
in
one
as
as
she
could
not
fail
to
produce
morbidness
mary
too
had
left
having
spoken
vaguely
of
taking
a
job
at
housework
in
piedmont
billy
could
help
saxon
little
in
her
trouble
he
dimly
sensed
her
suffering
without
comprehending
the
scope
and
intensity
of
it
he
was
too
and
by
his
very
sex
too
remote
from
the
intimate
tragedy
that
was
hers
he
was
an
outsider
at
the
best
a
friendly
onlooker
who
saw
little
to
her
the
baby
had
been
quick
and
real
it
was
still
quick
and
real
that
was
her
trouble
by
no
deliberate
effort
of
will
could
she
fill
the
aching
void
of
its
absence
its
reality
became
at
times
an
hallucination
somewhere
it
still
was
and
she
must
find
it
she
would
catch
herself
on
occasion
listening
with
strained
ears
for
the
cry
she
had
never
heard
yet
which
in
fancy
she
had
heard
a
thousand
times
in
the
happy
months
before
the
end
twice
she
left
her
bed
in
her
sleep
and
went
searching
each
time
coming
to
herself
beside
her
mother
chest
of
drawers
in
which
were
the
tiny
garments
to
herself
at
such
moments
she
would
say
i
had
a
baby
and
she
would
say
it
aloud
as
she
watched
the
children
playing
in
the
street
one
day
on
the
eighth
street
cars
a
young
mother
sat
beside
her
a
crowing
infant
in
her
arms
and
saxon
said
to
her
i
had
a
baby
once
it
the
mother
looked
at
her
startled
the
baby
tighter
in
her
arms
jealously
or
as
if
in
fear
then
she
softened
as
she
said
you
poor
yes
saxon
nodded
it
tears
welled
into
her
eyes
and
the
telling
of
her
grief
seemed
to
have
brought
relief
but
all
the
day
she
suffered
from
an
almost
overwhelming
desire
to
recite
her
sorrow
to
the
world
to
the
paying
teller
at
the
bank
to
the
elderly
in
salinger
to
the
blind
woman
guided
by
a
little
boy
who
played
on
the
concertina
to
every
one
save
the
policeman
the
police
were
new
and
terrible
creatures
to
her
now
she
had
seen
them
kill
the
strikers
as
mercilessly
as
the
strikers
had
killed
the
scabs
and
unlike
the
strikers
the
police
were
professional
killers
they
were
not
fighting
for
jobs
they
did
it
as
a
business
they
could
have
taken
prisoners
that
day
in
the
angle
of
her
front
steps
and
the
house
but
they
had
not
unconsciously
whenever
approaching
one
she
edged
across
the
sidewalk
so
as
to
get
as
far
as
possible
away
from
him
she
did
not
reason
it
out
but
deeper
than
consciousness
was
the
feeling
that
they
were
typical
of
something
inimical
to
her
and
hers
at
eighth
and
broadway
waiting
for
her
car
to
return
home
the
policeman
on
the
corner
recognized
her
and
greeted
her
she
turned
white
to
the
lips
and
her
heart
fluttered
painfully
it
was
only
ned
hermanmann
fatter
jollier
looking
than
ever
he
had
sat
across
the
aisle
from
her
for
three
terms
at
school
he
and
she
had
been
monitors
together
of
the
composition
books
for
one
term
the
day
the
powder
works
blew
up
at
pinole
breaking
every
window
in
the
school
he
and
she
had
not
joined
in
the
panic
rush
for
both
had
remained
in
the
room
and
the
irate
principal
had
exhibited
them
from
room
to
room
to
the
cowardly
classes
and
then
rewarded
them
with
a
month
holiday
from
school
and
after
that
ned
hermanmann
had
become
a
policeman
and
married
lena
highland
and
saxon
had
heard
they
had
five
children
but
in
spite
of
all
that
he
was
now
a
policeman
and
billy
was
now
a
striker
might
not
ned
hermanmann
some
day
club
and
shoot
billy
just
as
those
other
policemen
clubbed
and
shot
the
strikers
by
her
front
steps
what
the
matter
saxon
he
asked
sick
she
nodded
and
choked
unable
to
speak
and
started
to
move
toward
her
car
which
was
coming
to
a
stop
i
help
you
he
offered
she
shrank
away
from
his
hand
no
i
all
right
she
gasped
hurriedly
i
not
going
to
take
it
i
forgotten
she
turned
away
dizzily
up
broadway
to
ninth
two
blocks
along
ninth
she
turned
down
clay
and
back
to
eighth
street
where
she
waited
for
another
car
as
the
summer
months
dragged
along
the
industrial
situation
in
oakland
grew
steadily
worse
capital
everywhere
seemed
to
have
selected
this
city
for
the
battle
with
organized
labor
so
many
men
in
oakland
were
out
on
strike
or
were
locked
out
or
were
unable
to
work
because
of
the
dependence
of
their
trades
on
the
other
trades
that
odd
jobs
at
common
labor
were
hard
to
obtain
billy
occasionally
got
a
day
work
to
do
but
did
not
earn
enough
to
make
both
ends
meet
despite
the
small
strike
wages
received
at
first
and
despite
the
rigid
economy
he
and
saxon
practiced
the
table
she
set
had
scarcely
anything
in
common
with
that
of
their
first
married
year
not
alone
was
every
item
of
cheaper
quality
but
many
items
had
disappeared
meat
and
the
poorest
was
very
seldom
on
the
table
cow
milk
had
given
place
to
condensed
milk
and
even
the
sparing
use
of
the
latter
had
ceased
a
roll
of
butter
when
they
had
it
lasted
half
a
dozen
times
as
long
as
formerly
where
billy
had
been
used
to
drinking
three
cups
of
coffee
for
breakfast
he
now
drank
one
saxon
boiled
this
coffee
an
atrocious
length
of
time
and
she
paid
twenty
cents
a
pound
for
it
the
blight
of
hard
times
was
on
all
the
neighborhood
the
families
not
involved
in
one
strike
were
touched
by
some
other
strike
or
by
the
cessation
of
work
in
some
dependent
trade
many
single
young
men
who
were
lodgers
had
drifted
away
thus
increasing
the
house
rent
of
the
families
which
had
sheltered
them
gott
said
the
butcher
to
saxon
we
working
class
all
suffer
together
my
wife
she
can
not
get
her
teeth
fixed
now
pretty
soon
i
go
smash
broke
once
when
billy
was
preparing
to
pawn
his
watch
saxon
suggested
his
borrowing
the
money
from
billy
murphy
i
was
plannin
that
billy
answered
only
i
ca
now
i
did
tell
you
what
happened
tuesday
night
at
the
sporting
life
club
you
remember
that
squarehead
champion
of
the
united
states
navy
bill
was
matched
with
him
an
it
was
sure
easy
money
bill
had
goin
south
by
the
end
of
the
sixth
round
an
at
the
seventh
went
in
to
finish
and
then
just
his
luck
for
his
trade
idle
now
he
snaps
his
right
forearm
of
course
the
squarehead
comes
back
at
on
the
jump
an
good
night
for
bill
gee

gettin
our
bad
luck

saxon
cried
shuddering
involuntarily
what
billy
asked
with
open
mouth
of
surprise
do
say
that
word
again
bert
was
always
saying
oh
mohegans
all
right
i
wo

but
just
the
same
there
too
much
truth
in
the
word
for
me
to
like
it
sometimes
it
seems
as
though
he
was
right
times
have
changed
they
changed
even
since
i
was
a
little
girl
we
crossed
the
plains
and
opened
up
this
country
and
now
we
losing
even
the
chance
to
work
for
a
living
in
it
and
it
not
my
fault
it
not
your
fault
got
to
live
well
or
bad
just
by
luck
it
seems
there
no
other
way
to
explain
it
beats
me
billy
concurred
look
at
the
way
i
worked
last
year
never
missed
a
day
i
want
to
never
miss
a
day
this
year
an
here
i
have
done
a
tap
for
weeks
an
weeks
an
weeks
say
who
runs
this
country
anyway
saxon
had
stopped
the
morning
paper
but
frequently
maggie
boy
who
served
a
tribune
route
tossed
an
extra
on
her
steps
from
its
editorials
saxon
gleaned
that
organized
labor
was
trying
to
run
the
country
and
that
it
was
making
a
mess
of
it
it
was
all
the
fault
of
domineering
labor
so
ran
the
editorials
column
by
column
day
by
day
and
saxon
was
convinced
yet
remained
unconvinced
the
social
puzzle
of
living
was
too
intricate
the
teamsters
strike
backed
financially
by
the
teamsters
of
san
francisco
and
by
the
allied
unions
of
the
san
francisco
water
front
confederation
promised
to
be
whether
or
not
it
was
successful
the
oakland
and
stablemen
with
few
exceptions
had
gone
out
with
the
teamsters
the
teaming
firms
were
not
their
contracts
but
the
employers
association
was
helping
them
in
fact
half
the
employers
associations
of
the
pacific
coast
were
helping
the
oakland
employers
association
saxon
was
behind
a
month
rent
which
when
it
is
considered
that
rent
was
paid
in
advance
was
equivalent
to
two
months
likewise
she
was
two
months
behind
in
the
installments
on
the
furniture
yet
she
was
not
pressed
very
hard
by
salinger
the
furniture
dealers
we
givin
you
all
the
rope
we
can
said
their
collector
my
orders
is
to
make
you
dig
up
every
cent
i
can
and
at
the
same
time
not
to
be
too
hard
salinger
are
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
but
they
up
against
it
too
you
no
idea
how
many
accounts
like
yours
carrying
along
sooner
or
later
they
have
to
call
a
halt
or
get
it
in
the
neck
themselves
and
in
the
meantime
just
see
if
you
ca
scrape
up
five
dollars
by
next
week
just
to
cheer
them
along
you
one
of
the
stablemen
who
had
not
gone
out
henderson
by
name
worked
at
billy
stables
despite
the
urging
of
the
bosses
to
eat
and
sleep
in
the
stable
like
the
other
men
henderson
had
persisted
in
coming
home
each
morning
to
his
little
house
around
the
corner
from
saxon
on
fifth
street
several
times
she
had
seen
him
swinging
along
defiantly
his
dinner
pail
in
his
hand
while
the
neighborhood
boys
dogged
his
heels
at
a
safe
distance
and
informed
him
in
yapping
chorus
that
he
was
a
scab
and
no
good
but
one
evening
on
his
way
to
work
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
he
went
into
the
home
the
saloon
at
seventh
and
pine
there
it
was
his
mortal
mischance
to
encounter
otto
frank
a
striker
who
drove
from
the
same
stable
not
many
minutes
later
an
ambulance
was
hurrying
henderson
to
the
receiving
hospital
with
a
fractured
skull
while
a
patrol
wagon
was
no
less
swiftly
carrying
otto
frank
to
the
city
prison
maggie
donahue
it
was
eyes
shining
with
gladness
who
told
saxon
of
the
happening
served
him
right
too
the
dirty
scab
maggie
concluded
but
his
poor
wife
was
saxon
cry
she
not
strong
and
then
the
children
she
never
be
able
to
take
care
of
them
if
her
husband
an
serve
her
right
the
damned
slut
saxon
was
both
shocked
and
hurt
by
the
irishwoman
brutality
but
maggie
was
implacable
is
all
she
or
any
woman
deserves
that
put
up
an
live
with
a
scab
what
about
her
children
let
starve
an
her
man
the
food
out
of
other
children
olsen
attitude
was
different
beyond
passive
sentimental
pity
for
henderson
wife
and
children
she
gave
them
no
thought
her
chief
concern
being
for
otto
frank
and
otto
frank
wife
and
children
herself
and
frank
being
full
sisters
if
he
dies
they
will
hang
otto
she
said
and
then
what
will
poor
hilda
do
she
has
varicose
veins
in
both
legs
and
she
never
can
stand
on
her
feet
all
day
an
work
for
wages
and
me
i
can
not
help
carl
out
of
work
too
billy
had
still
another
point
of
view
it
will
give
the
strike
a
black
eye
especially
if
henderson
croaks
he
worried
when
he
came
home
they
hang
frank
on
record
time
besides
we
have
to
put
up
a
defense
an
lawyers
charge
like
sam
hill
they
eat
a
hole
in
our
treasury
you
could
drive
every
team
in
oakland
through
an
if
frank
had
ben
screwed
up
with
whisky
never
it
he
the
mildest
man
sober
you
ever
twice
that
evening
billy
left
the
house
to
find
out
if
henderson
was
dead
yet
in
the
morning
the
papers
gave
little
hope
and
the
evening
papers
published
his
death
otto
frank
lay
in
jail
without
bail
the
tribune
demanded
a
quick
trial
and
summary
execution
calling
on
the
prospective
jury
manfully
to
do
its
duty
and
dwelling
at
length
on
the
moral
effect
that
would
be
so
produced
upon
the
lawless
working
class
it
went
further
emphasizing
the
salutary
effect
machine
guns
would
have
on
the
mob
that
had
taken
the
fair
city
of
oakland
by
the
throat
and
all
such
occurrences
struck
at
saxon
personally
practically
alone
in
the
world
save
for
billy
it
was
her
life
and
his
and
their
mutual
that
was
menaced
from
the
moment
he
left
the
house
to
the
moment
of
his
return
she
knew
no
peace
of
mind
rough
work
was
afoot
of
which
he
told
her
nothing
and
she
knew
he
was
playing
his
part
in
it
on
more
than
one
occasion
she
noticed
skin
on
his
knuckles
at
such
times
he
was
remarkably
taciturn
and
would
sit
in
brooding
silence
or
go
almost
immediately
to
bed
she
was
afraid
to
have
this
habit
of
reticence
grow
on
him
and
bravely
she
bid
for
his
confidence
she
climbed
into
his
lap
and
inside
his
arms
one
of
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
with
the
free
hand
she
caressed
his
hair
back
from
the
forehead
and
smoothed
out
the
moody
brows
now
listen
to
me
billy
boy
she
began
lightly
you
have
been
playing
fair
and
i
wo
have
it
no
she
pressed
his
lips
shut
with
her
fingers
i
doing
the
talking
now
and
because
you
have
been
doing
your
share
of
the
talking
for
some
time
you
remember
we
agreed
at
the
start
to
always
talk
things
over
i
was
the
first
to
break
this
when
i
sold
my
fancy
work
to
higgins
without
speaking
to
you
about
it
and
i
was
very
sorry
i
am
still
sorry
and
i
never
done
it
since
now
it
your
turn
you
not
talking
things
over
with
me
you

and

rube
before
an
after
you
thought
he
was
a
lightnin
change
artist
laugh
you
billy
halted
to
give
vent
to
his
own
mirth
saxon
forced
herself
to
join
with
him
but
down
in
her
heart
was
horror
mercedes
was
right
the
stupid
workers
wrangled
and
snarled
over
jobs
the
clever
masters
rode
in
automobiles
and
did
not
wrangle
and
snarl
they
hired
other
stupid
ones
to
do
the
wrangling
and
snarling
for
them
it
was
men
like
bert
and
frank
davis
like
chester
johnson
and
otto
frank
like
jelly
belly
and
the
pinkertons
like
henderson
and
all
the
rest
of
the
scabs
who
were
beaten
up
shot
clubbed
or
hanged
ah
the
clever
ones
were
very
clever
nothing
happened
to
them
they
only
rode
in
their
automobiles
big
stiffs
the
rube
snivels
as
he
crawls
to
his
feet
at
the
end
billy
was
continuing
think
you
still
want
that
job
i
ask
he
shakes
his
head
then
i
read
the
riot
act
only
one
thing
for
you
to
do
old
hoss
an
that
beat
it
d
get
me
beat
it
back
to
the
farm
for
you
an
if
you
come
monkeyin
around
town
again
be
real
mad
at
you
we
was
only
foolin
this
time
but
next
time
we
catch
you
your
own
mother
wo
know
you
when
we
get
done
with
you
an
say
you
oughta
seen
beat
it
i
bet
he
goin
yet
ah
when
he
gets
back
to
milpitas
or
sleepy
hollow
or
wherever
he
hangs
out
tells
how
the
boys
does
things
in
oakland
it
dollars
to
doughnuts
they
wo
be
a
rube
in
his
district
that
come
to
town
to
drive
if
they
offered
ten
dollars
an
it
was
awful
saxon
said
then
laughed
appreciation
but
that
was
nothin
billy
went
on
a
bunch
of
the
boys
caught
another
one
this
morning
they
did
do
a
thing
to
him
my
goodness
gracious
no
in
two
minutes
he
was
the
worst
wreck
they
ever
hauled
to
the
receivin
hospital
the
evenin
papers
gave
the
score
nose
broken
three
bad
scalp
wounds
front
teeth
out
a
broken
collarbone
an
two
broken
ribs
gee
he
certainly
got
all
that
was
comin
to
him
but
that
nothin
d
want
to
know
what
the
frisco
teamsters
did
in
the
big
strike
before
the
earthquake
they
took
every
scab
they
caught
an
broke
both
his
arms
with
a
crowbar
that
was
so
he
could
drive
you
see
say
the
hospitals
was
filled
with
an
the
teamsters
won
that
strike
but
is
it
necessary
billy
to
be
so
terrible
i
know
they
scabs
and
that
they
taking
the
bread
out
of
the
strikers
children
mouths
to
put
in
their
own
children
mouths
and
that
it
is
fair
and
all
that
but
just
the
same
is
it
necessary
to
be
so
terrible
sure
thing
billy
answered
confidently
we
just
got
ta
throw
the
fear
of
god
into
them
when
we
can
do
it
without
bein
and
if
you
caught
then
the
union
hires
the
lawyers
to
defend
us
though
that
much
good
now
for
the
judges
are
pretty
hostyle
an
the
papers
keep
hammerin
away
at
them
to
give
stiffer
an
stiffer
sentences
just
the
same
before
this
strike
over
there
be
a
whole
lot
of
guys
they
never
gone
very
cautiously
in
the
next
half
hour
saxon
tried
to
feel
out
her
husband
attitude
to
find
if
he
doubted
the
rightness
of
the
violence
he
and
his
brother
teamsters
committed
but
billy
ethical
sanction
was
and
profound
it
never
entered
his
head
that
he
was
not
absolutely
right
it
was
the
game
caught
in
its
tangled
meshes
he
could
see
no
other
way
to
play
it
than
the
way
all
men
played
it
he
did
not
stand
for
dynamite
and
murder
however
but
then
the
unions
did
not
stand
for
such
quite
naive
was
his
explanation
that
dynamite
and
murder
did
not
pay
that
such
actions
always
brought
down
the
condemnation
of
the
public
and
broke
the
strikes
but
the
healthy
beating
up
of
a
scab
he
contended
the
throwing
of
the
fear
of
god
into
a
scab
as
he
expressed
it
was
the
only
right
and
proper
thing
to
do
our
folks
never
had
to
do
such
things
saxon
said
finally
they
never
had
strikes
nor
scabs
in
those
you
bet
they
did
billy
agreed
them
was
the
good
old
days
liked
to
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
sighed
but
them
times
will
never
come
would
you
have
liked
living
in
the
country
saxon
asked
sure
there
lots
of
men
living
in
the
country
now
she
suggested
just
the
same
i
notice
them
to
town
to
get
our
jobs
was
his
reply
chapter
xii
a
gleam
of
light
came
when
billy
got
a
job
driving
a
grading
team
for
the
contractors
of
the
big
bridge
then
building
at
niles
before
he
went
he
made
certain
that
it
was
a
union
job
and
a
union
job
it
was
for
two
days
when
the
concrete
workers
threw
down
their
tools
the
contractors
evidently
prepared
for
such
happening
immediately
filled
the
places
of
the
concrete
men
with
nonunion
italians
whereupon
the
carpenters
structural
ironworkers
and
teamsters
walked
out
and
billy
lacking
train
fare
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
walking
home
i
could
work
as
a
scab
he
concluded
his
tale
no
saxon
said
you
could
work
as
a
but
she
wondered
why
it
was
that
when
men
wanted
to
work
and
there
was
work
to
do
yet
they
were
unable
to
work
because
their
unions
said
no
why
were
there
unions
and
if
unions
had
to
be
why
were
not
all
workingmen
in
them
then
there
would
be
no
scabs
and
billy
could
work
every
day
also
she
wondered
where
she
was
to
get
a
sack
of
flour
for
she
had
long
since
ceased
the
extravagance
of
baker
bread
and
so
many
other
of
the
neighborhood
women
had
done
this
that
the
little
welsh
baker
had
closed
up
shop
and
gone
away
taking
his
wife
and
two
little
daughters
with
him
look
where
she
would
everybody
was
being
hurt
by
the
industrial
strife
one
afternoon
came
a
caller
at
her
door
and
that
evening
came
billy
with
dubious
news
he
had
been
approached
that
day
all
he
had
to
do
he
told
saxon
was
to
say
the
word
and
he
could
go
into
the
stable
as
foreman
at
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
the
nearness
of
such
a
sum
the
possibility
of
it
was
almost
stunning
to
saxon
sitting
at
a
supper
which
consisted
of
boiled
potatoes
beans
and
a
small
dry
onion
which
they
were
eating
raw
there
was
neither
bread
coffee
nor
butter
the
onion
billy
had
pulled
from
his
pocket
having
picked
it
up
in
the
street
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
she
moistened
her
lips
and
fought
for
control
what
made
them
offer
it
to
you
she
questioned
that
easy
was
his
answer
they
got
a
dozen
reasons
the
guy
the
boss
has
had
exercisin
prince
and
king
is
a
dub
king
has
gone
lame
in
the
shoulders
then
they
guessin
pretty
strong
that
i
the
party
that
put
a
lot
of
their
scabs
outa
commission
macklin
ben
their
foreman
for
years
an
years
why
i
was
in
knee
pants
when
he
was
foreman
well
he
sick
an
all
in
they
got
ta
have
somebody
to
take
his
place
then
too
i
been
with
a
long
time
an
on
top
of
that
i
the
man
for
the
job
they
know
i
know
horses
from
the
ground
up
hell
it
all
i
good
for
except
think
of
it
billy
she
breathed
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
an
throw
the
fellows
down
he
said
it
was
not
a
question
nor
was
it
a
statement
it
was
anything
saxon
chose
to
make
of
it
they
looked
at
each
other
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
but
he
continued
merely
to
look
it
came
to
her
that
she
was
facing
one
of
the
decisive
moments
of
her
life
and
she
gripped
herself
to
face
it
in
all
coolness
nor
would
billy
proffer
her
the
slightest
help
whatever
his
own
judgment
might
be
he
masked
it
with
an
expressionless
face
his
eyes
betrayed
nothing
he
looked
and
waited
you
you
ca
do
that
billy
she
said
finally
you
ca
throw
the
fellows
his
hand
shot
out
to
hers
and
his
face
was
a
sudden
radiant
dawn
put
her
there
he
cried
their
hands
meeting
and
clasping
you
the
truest
true
blue
wife
a
man
ever
had
if
all
the
other
fellows
wives
was
like
you
we
could
win
any
strike
we
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
were
married
billy
seen
in
hell
than
it
does
make
any
difference
being
married
i
got
to
stand
by
you
in
everything
you
stand
for
i
be
a
nice
wife
if
i
she
remembered
her
caller
of
the
afternoon
and
knew
the
moment
was
too
propitious
to
let
pass
there
was
a
man
here
this
afternoon
billy
he
wanted
a
room
i
told
him
i
speak
to
you
he
said
he
would
pay
six
dollars
a
month
for
the
back
bedroom
that
would
pay
half
a
month
installment
on
the
furniture
and
buy
a
sack
of
flour
and
we
all
out
of
billy
old
hostility
to
the
idea
was
instantly
uppermost
and
saxon
watched
him
anxiously
some
scab
in
the
shops
i
suppose
no
he
firing
on
the
freight
run
to
san
jose
harmon
he
said
his
name
was
james
harmon
they
just
transferred
him
from
the
truckee
division
he
sleep
days
mostly
he
said
and
that
why
he
wanted
a
quiet
house
without
children
in
in
the
end
with
much
misgiving
and
only
after
saxon
had
insistently
pointed
out
how
little
work
it
entailed
on
her
billy
consented
though
he
continued
to
protest
as
an
afterthought
but
i
do
want
you
makin
beds
for
any
man
it
ai
right
saxon
i
oughta
take
care
of
and
you
would
she
flashed
back
at
him
if
you
take
the
foremanship
only
you
ca
it
would
be
right
and
if
i
to
stand
by
you
it
only
fair
to
let
me
do
what
i
james
harmon
proved
even
less
a
bother
than
saxon
had
anticipated
for
a
fireman
he
was
scrupulously
clean
always
washing
up
in
the
roundhouse
before
he
came
home
he
used
the
key
to
the
kitchen
door
coming
and
going
by
the
back
steps
to
saxon
he
barely
said
or
good
day
and
sleeping
in
the
day
time
and
working
at
night
he
was
in
the
house
a
week
before
billy
laid
eyes
on
him
billy
had
taken
to
coming
home
later
and
later
and
to
going
out
after
supper
by
himself
he
did
not
offer
to
tell
saxon
where
he
went
nor
did
she
ask
for
that
matter
it
required
little
shrewdness
on
her
part
to
guess
the
fumes
of
whisky
were
on
his
lips
at
such
times
his
slow
deliberate
ways
were
even
slower
even
more
deliberate
liquor
did
not
affect
his
legs
he
walked
as
soberly
as
any
man
there
was
no
hesitancy
no
faltering
in
his
muscular
movements
the
whisky
went
to
his
brain
making
his
eyes
and
the
cloudiness
of
them
more
cloudy
not
that
he
was
flighty
nor
quick
nor
irritable
on
the
contrary
the
liquor
imparted
to
his
mental
processes
a
deep
gravity
and
brooding
solemnity
he
talked
little
but
that
little
was
ominous
and
oracular
at
such
times
there
was
no
appeal
from
his
judgment
no
discussion
he
knew
as
god
knew
and
when
he
chose
to
speak
a
harsh
thought
it
was
harsher
than
ordinarily
because
it
seemed
to
proceed
out
of
such
profundity
of
cogitation
because
it
was
as
prodigiously
deliberate
in
its
incubation
as
it
was
in
its
enunciation
it
was
not
a
nice
side
he
was
showing
to
saxon
it
was
almost
as
if
a
stranger
had
come
to
live
with
her
despite
herself
she
found
herself
beginning
to
shrink
from
him
and
little
could
she
comfort
herself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
not
his
real
self
for
she
remembered
his
gentleness
and
considerateness
all
his
finenesses
of
the
past
then
he
had
made
a
continual
effort
to
avoid
trouble
and
fighting
now
he
enjoyed
it
exulted
in
it
went
looking
for
it
all
this
showed
in
his
face
no
longer
was
he
the
smiling
boy
he
smiled
infrequently
now
his
face
was
a
man
face
the
lips
the
eyes
the
lines
were
harsh
as
his
thoughts
were
harsh
he
was
rarely
unkind
to
saxon
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
rarely
kind
his
attitude
toward
her
was
growing
negative
he
was
disinterested
despite
the
fight
for
the
union
she
was
enduring
with
him
putting
up
with
him
shoulder
to
shoulder
she
occupied
but
little
space
in
his
mind
when
he
acted
toward
her
gently
she
could
see
that
it
was
merely
mechanical
just
as
she
was
well
aware
that
the
endearing
terms
he
used
the
endearing
caresses
he
gave
were
only
habitual
the
spontaneity
and
warmth
had
gone
out
often
when
he
was
not
in
liquor
flashes
of
the
old
billy
came
back
but
even
such
flashes
dwindled
in
frequency
he
was
growing
preoccupied
moody
hard
times
and
the
bitter
stresses
of
industrial
conflict
strained
him
especially
was
this
apparent
in
his
sleep
when
he
suffered
paroxysms
of
lawless
dreams
groaning
and
muttering
clenching
his
fists
grinding
his
teeth
twisting
with
muscular
tensions
his
face
writhing
with
passions
and
violences
his
throat
guttering
with
terrible
curses
that
rasped
and
aborted
on
his
lips
and
saxon
lying
beside
him
afraid
of
this
visitor
to
her
bed
whom
she
did
not
know
remembered
what
mary
had
told
her
of
bert
he
too
had
cursed
and
clenched
his
fists
in
his
nights
fought
out
the
battles
of
his
days
one
thing
however
saxon
saw
clearly
by
no
deliberate
act
of
was
he
becoming
this
other
and
unlovely
billy
were
there
no
strike
no
snarling
and
wrangling
over
jobs
there
would
be
only
the
old
billy
she
had
loved
in
all
absoluteness
this
sleeping
terror
in
him
would
have
lain
asleep
it
was
something
that
was
being
awakened
in
him
an
image
incarnate
of
outward
conditions
as
cruel
as
ugly
as
maleficent
as
were
those
outward
conditions
but
if
the
strike
continued
then
she
feared
with
reason
would
this
other
and
grisly
self
of
billy
strengthen
to
fuller
and
more
forbidding
stature
and
this
she
knew
would
mean
the
wreck
of
their
such
a
billy
she
could
not
love
in
its
nature
such
a
billy
was
not
lovable
nor
capable
of
love
and
then
at
the
thought
of
offspring
she
shuddered
it
was
too
terrible
and
at
such
moments
of
contemplation
from
her
soul
the
inevitable
plaint
of
the
human
went
up
why
why
why
billy
too
had
his
unanswerable
queries
why
wo
the
building
trades
come
out
he
demanded
wrathfuly
of
the
obscurity
that
veiled
the
ways
of
living
and
the
world
but
no
wo
stand
for
a
strike
and
he
has
the
building
trades
council
under
his
thumb
but
why
do
they
chuck
him
and
come
out
anyway
we
win
hands
down
all
along
the
line
but
no
got
their
goat
an
him
up
to
his
dirty
neck
in
politics
an
graft
an
damn
the
federation
of
labor
if
all
the
railroad
boys
had
come
out
would
the
shop
men
have
won
instead
of
bein
licked
to
a
frazzle
lord
i
ai
had
a
smoke
of
decent
tobacco
or
a
cup
of
decent
coffee
in
a
coon
age
i
forgotten
what
a
square
meal
tastes
like
i
weighed
myself
yesterday
fifteen
pounds
lighter
than
when
the
strike
begun
if
it
keeps
on
much
more
i
can
fight
middleweight
an
this
is
what
i
get
after
payin
dues
into
the
union
for
years
and
years
i
ca
get
a
square
meal
an
my
wife
has
to
make
other
men
beds
it
makes
my
tired
ache
some
day
i
get
real
huffy
an
chuck
that
lodger
but
it
not
his
fault
billy
saxon
protested
who
said
it
was
billy
snapped
roughly
ca
i
kick
in
general
if
i
want
to
just
the
same
it
makes
me
sick
what
the
good
of
organized
labor
if
it
do
stand
together
for
two
cents
i
chuck
the
whole
thing
up
an
go
over
to
the
employers
only
i
would
god
damn
them
if
they
think
they
can
beat
us
down
to
our
knees
let
go
ahead
try
it
that
all
but
it
gets
me
just
the
same
the
whole
clean
dippy
they
ai
no
sense
in
anything
what
the
good
of
supportin
a
union
that
ca
win
a
strike
what
the
good
of
the
blocks
off
of
scabs
when
they
keep
thick
as
ever
the
whole
thing
bughouse
an
i
guess
i
am
such
an
outburst
on
billy
part
was
so
unusual
that
it
was
the
only
time
saxon
knew
it
to
occur
always
he
was
sullen
and
dogged
and
unwhipped
while
whisky
only
served
to
set
the
maggots
of
certitude
crawling
in
his
brain
one
night
billy
did
not
get
home
till
after
twelve
saxon
anxiety
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
police
fighting
and
head
breaking
had
been
reported
to
have
occurred
when
billy
came
his
appearance
verified
the
report
his
coatsleeves
were
half
torn
off
the
windsor
tie
had
disappeared
from
under
his
soft
collar
and
every
button
had
been
ripped
off
the
front
of
the
shirt
when
he
took
his
hat
off
saxon
was
frightened
by
a
lump
on
his
head
the
size
of
an
apple
d
know
who
did
that
that
dutch
slob
hermanmann
with
a
riot
club
an
i
get
for
it
some
day
good
an
plenty
an
there

fellow

got
staked
out
that
be
my
meat
when
this
strike
over
things
is
settled
down
blanchard

blanchard
perkins
and
company
saxon

old

with
a
lump
of

size
of
a
water
bucket
that
was
when

turnin
into
franklin
just
off
eighth
by
the
old
galindo
hotel
they

hard

troops
they
was
afraid
to
shoot
why
we
tore
holes
through
the
police
force
an
the
ambulances
and
patrol
wagons
worked
but
say
we
got
the
procession
blocked
at
fourteenth
and
broadway
right
under
the
nose
of
the
city
hall
rushed
the
rear
end
cut
out
the
horses
of
five
wagons
an
handed
them
college
guys
a
few
in
passin
all
that
saved
from
hospital
was
the
police
reserves
just
the
same
we
had
jammed
an
hour
there
you
oughta
seen
the
street
cars
blocked
too
broadway
fourteenth
san
pablo
as
far
as
you
could
but
what
did
blanchard

him
back
he
led
the
procession
an
he
drove
my
team
all
the
teams
was
from
my
stable
he
rounded
up
a
lot
of
them
college
fellows
fraternity
guys
they
called
yaps
that
live
off
their
fathers
money
they
come
to
the
stable
in
big
tourin
cars
an
drove
out
the
wagons
with
half
the
police
of
oakland
to
help
them
say
it
was
sure
some
day
the
sky
rained
cobblestones
an
you
oughta
heard
the
clubs
on
our
heads
an
say
the
chief
of
police
in
a
police
auto
sittin
up
like
god
almighty
just
before
we
got
to
peralta
street
they
was
a
block
an
the
police
chargin
an
an
old
woman
right
from
her
front
gate
lammed
the
chief
of
police
full
in
the
face
with
a
dead
cat
phew
you
could
hear

woman
he
yells
with
his
handkerchief
out
but
the
boys
beat
the

an
fabiola
an

stables
blanchard
drove
the
first
wagon

he
was
knocked
clean
off
the
seat
once
but
he
stayed

had
to
hike
to
the
poorhouse
because
their
folks
could
take
care
of
in
these
in
the
morning
paper
saxon
read
the
exciting
account
of
the
futile
attempt
to
break
the
teamsters
strike
roy
blanchard
was
hailed
a
hero
and
held
up
as
a
model
of
wealthy
citizenship
and
to
save
herself
she
could
not
help
glowing
with
appreciation
of
his
courage
there
was
something
fine
in
his
going
out
to
face
the
snarling
pack
a
brigadier
general
of
the
regular
army
was
quoted
as
lamenting
the
fact
that
the
troops
had
not
been
called
out
to
take
the
mob
by
the
throat
and
shake
law
and
order
into
it
this
is
the
time
for
a
little
healthful
bloodletting
was
the
conclusion
of
his
remarks
after
deploring
the
pacific
methods
of
the
police
for
not
until
the
mob
has
been
thoroughly
beaten
and
cowed
will
tranquil
industrial
conditions
that
evening
saxon
and
billy
went
up
town
returning
home
and
finding
nothing
to
eat
he
had
taken
her
on
one
arm
his
overcoat
on
the
other
the
overcoat
he
had
pawned
at
uncle
sam
and
he
and
saxon
had
eaten
drearily
at
a
japanese
restaurant
which
in
some
miraculous
way
managed
to
set
a
meal
for
ten
cents
after
eating
they
started
on
their
way
to
spend
an
additional
five
cents
each
on
a
moving
picture
show
at
the
central
bank
building
two
striking
teamsters
accosted
billy
and
took
him
away
with
them
saxon
waited
on
the
corner
and
when
he
returned
three
quarters
of
an
hour
later
she
knew
he
had
been
drinking
half
a
block
on
passing
the
forum
cafe
he
stopped
suddenly
a
limousine
stood
at
the
curb
and
into
it
a
young
man
was
helping
several
wonderfully
gowned
women
a
chauffeur
sat
in
the
driver
sent
billy
touched
the
young
man
on
the
arm
he
was
as
as
billy
and
slightly
taller
in
saxon
opinion
he
was
undeniably
handsome
just
a
word
sport
billy
said
in
a
low
slow
voice
the
young
man
glanced
quickly
at
billy
and
saxon
and
asked
impatiently
well
what
is
it
you
blanchard
billy
began
i
seen
you
yesterday
lead
out
that
bunch
of
did
i
do
it
all
right
blanchard
asked
gaily
with
a
flash
of
glance
to
saxon
and
back
again
sure
but
that
ai
what
i
want
to
talk
who
are
you
the
other
demanded
with
sudden
suspicion
a
striker
it
just
happens

drove
my
team
that
all
no
move

a
as
blanchard
half
reached
toward
his
hip
pocket
i
ai
startin
anythin

but
i
just
want
to
tell
you
be
quick
blanchard
lifted
one
foot
to
step
into
the
machine
sure
billy
went
on
without
any
diminution
of
his
exasperating
slowness
what
i
want
to
tell
you
is
that
i
after

now
when
the
strike

but
some
time
later

beatin
of
your
blanchard

billy
over
with
new
interest
and
measuring
eyes
that
sparkled
with
appreciation

a
husky

he
said
but
do

think

blanchard
nodded
smiled
genially
to
both
of
them
raised
his
hat
to
saxon
and
stepped
into
the
machine
chapter
xiii
from
now
on
to
saxon
life
seemed
bereft
of
its
last
reason
and
rhyme
it
had
become
senseless
nightmarish
anything
irrational
was
possible
there
was
nothing
stable
in
the
anarchic
flux
of
affairs
that
swept
her
on
she
knew
not
to
what
catastrophic
end
had
billy
been
dependable
all
would
still
have
been
well
with
him
to
cling
to
she
would
have
faced
everything
fearlessly
but
he
had
been
whirled
away
from
her
in
the
prevailing
madness
so
radical
was
the
change
in
him
that
he
seemed
almost
an
intruder
in
the
house
spiritually
he
was
such
an
intruder
another
man
looked
out
of
his
eyes
a
man
whose
thoughts
were
of
violence
and
hatred
a
man
to
whom
there
was
no
good
in
anything
and
who
had
become
an
ardent
protagonist
of
the
evil
that
was
rampant
and
universal
this
man
no
longer
condemned
bert
himself
muttering
vaguely
of
dynamite
and
sabotage
and
revolution
saxon
strove
to
maintain
that
sweetness
and
coolness
of
flesh
and
spirit
that
billy
had
praised
in
the
old
days
once
only
she
lost
control
he
had
been
in
a
particularly
ugly
mood
and
a
final
harshness
and
unfairness
cut
her
to
the
quick
who
are
you
speaking
to
she
flamed
out
at
him
he
was
speechless
and
abashed
and
could
only
stare
at
her
face
which
was
white
with
anger
do
you
ever
speak
to
me
like
that
again
billy
she
commanded
aw
ca
you
put
up
with
a
piece
of
bad
temper
he
muttered
half
apologetically
yet
half
defiantly
god
knows
i
got
enough
to
make
me
after
he
left
the
house
she
flung
herself
on
the
bed
and
cried
for
she
who
knew
so
thoroughly
the
humility
of
love
was
a
proud
woman
only
the
proud
can
be
truly
humble
as
only
the
strong
may
know
the
fullness
of
gentleness
but
what
was
the
use
she
demanded
of
being
proud
and
game
when
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
mattered
to
her
lost
his
own
pride
and
gameness
and
fairness
and
gave
her
the
worse
share
of
their
mutual
trouble
and
now
as
she
had
faced
alone
the
deeper
organic
hurt
of
the
loss
of
her
baby
she
faced
alone
another
and
in
a
way
an
even
greater
personal
trouble
perhaps
she
loved
billy
none
the
less
but
her
love
was
changing
into
something
less
proud
less
confident
less
trusting
it
was
becoming
shot
through
with
pity
with
the
pity
that
is
parent
to
contempt
her
own
loyalty
was
threatening
to
weaken
and
she
shuddered
and
shrank
from
the
contempt
she
could
see
creeping
in
she
struggled
to
steel
herself
to
face
the
situation
forgiveness
stole
into
her
heart
and
she
knew
relief
until
the
thought
came
that
in
the
truest
highest
love
forgiveness
should
have
no
place
and
again
she
cried
and
continued
her
battle
after
all
one
thing
was
incontestable
this
billy
was
not
the
billy
she
had
loved
this
billy
was
another
man
a
sick
man
and
no
more
to
be
held
responsible
than
a
in
the
ravings
of
delirium
she
must
be
billy
nurse
without
pride
without
contempt
with
nothing
to
forgive
besides
he
was
really
bearing
the
brunt
of
the
fight
was
in
the
thick
of
it
dizzy
with
the
striking
of
blows
and
the
blows
he
received
if
fault
there
was
it
lay
elsewhere
somewhere
in
the
tangled
scheme
of
things
that
made
men
snarl
over
jobs
like
dogs
over
bones
so
saxon
arose
and
buckled
on
her
armor
again
for
the
hardest
fight
of
all
in
the
world
arena
the
woman
fight
she
ejected
from
her
thought
all
doubting
and
distrust
she
forgave
nothing
for
there
was
nothing
requiring
forgiveness
she
pledged
herself
to
an
absoluteness
of
belief
that
her
love
and
billy
was
unsullied
unperturbed
severe
as
it
had
always
been
as
it
would
be
when
it
came
back
again
after
the
world
settled
down
once
more
to
rational
ways
that
night
when
he
came
home
she
proposed
as
an
emergency
measure
that
she
should
resume
her
needlework
and
help
keep
the
pot
boiling
until
the
strike
was
over
but
billy
would
hear
nothing
of
it
it
all
right
he
assured
her
repeatedly
they
ai
no
call
for
you
to
work
i
goin
to
get
some
money
before
the
week
is
out
an
turn
it
over
to
you
an
saturday
night
we
go
to
the
show
a
real
show

movin
pictures
harvey
nigger

is
comin
to
town
we
go
saturday
night
i
have
the
money
before
that
as
sure
as
beans
is
friday
evening
he
did
not
come
home
to
supper
which
saxon
regretted
for
maggie
donahue
had
returned
a
pan
of
potatoes
and
two
quarts
of
flour
borrowed
the
week
before
and
it
was
a
hearty
meal
that
awaited
him
saxon
kept
the
stove
going
till
nine
when
despite
her
reluctance
she
went
to
bed
her
preference
would
have
been
to
wait
up
but
she
did
not
dare
knowing
full
well
what
the
effect
would
be
on
him
did
he
come
home
in
liquor
the
clock
had
just
struck
one
when
she
heard
the
click
of
the
gate
slowly
heavily
ominously
she
heard
him
come
up
the
steps
and
fumble
with
his
key
at
the
door
he
entered
the
bedroom
and
she
heard
him
sigh
as
he
sat
down
she
remained
quiet
for
she
had
learned
the
hypersensitiveness
induced
by
drink
and
was
fastidiously
careful
not
to
hurt
him
even
with
the
knowledge
that
she
had
lain
awake
for
him
it
was
not
easy
her
hands
were
clenched
till
the
nails
dented
the
palms
and
her
body
was
rigid
in
her
passionate
effort
for
control
never
had
he
come
home
as
bad
as
this
saxon
he
called
thickly
she
stired
and
yawned
what
is
it
she
asked
wo
you
strike
a
light
my
fingers
is
all
without
looking
at
him
she
complied
but
so
violent
was
the
nervous
trembling
of
her
hands
that
the
glass
chimney
tinkled
against
the
globe
and
the
match
went
out
i
ai
drunk
saxon
he
said
in
the
darkness
a
hint
of
amusement
in
his
thick
voice
i
only
had
two
or
three
jolts
of
that
on
her
second
attempt
with
the
lamp
she
succeeded
when
she
turned
to
look
at
him
she
screamed
with
fright
though
she
had
heard
his
voice
and
knew
him
to
be
billy
for
the
instant
she
did
not
recognize
him
his
face
was
a
face
she
had
never
known
swollen
bruised
discolored
every
feature
had
been
beaten
out
of
all
semblance
of
familiarity
one
eye
was
entirely
closed
the
other
showed
through
a
narrow
slit
of
flesh
one
ear
seemed
to
have
lost
most
of
its
skin
the
whole
face
was
a
swollen
pulp
his
right
jaw
in
particular
was
twice
the
size
of
the
left
no
wonder
his
speech
had
been
thick
was
her
thought
as
she
regarded
the
fearfully
cut
and
swollen
lips
that
still
bled
she
was
sickened
by
the
sight
and
her
heart
went
out
to
him
in
a
great
wave
of
tenderness
she
wanted
to
put
her
arms
around
him
and
cuddle
and
soothe
him
but
her
practical
judgment
bade
otherwise
you
poor
poor
boy
she
cried
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
do
first
i
do
know
about
such
if
you
could
help
me
get
my
clothes
off
he
suggested
meekly
and
thickly
i
got
on
before
i
stiffened
and
then
hot
water
that
will
be
good
she
said
as
she
began
gently
drawing
his
coat
sleeve
over
a
puffed
and
helpless
hand
i
told
you
they
was
all
thumbs
he
grimaced
holding
up
his
hand
and
squinting
at
it
with
the
fraction
of
sight
remaining
to
him
you
sit
and
wait
she
said
till
i
start
the
fire
and
get
the
hot
water
going
i
wo
be
a
minute
then
i
finish
getting
your
clothes
from
the
kitchen
she
could
hear
him
mumbling
to
himself
and
when
she
returned
he
was
repeating
over
and
over
we
needed
the
money
saxon
we
needed
the
drunken
he
was
not
she
could
see
that
and
from
his
babbling
she
knew
he
was
partly
delirious
he
was
a
surprise
box
he
wandered
on
while
she
proceeded
to
undress
him
and
bit
by
bit
she
was
able
to
piece
together
what
had
happened
he
was
an
unknown
from
chicago
they
sprang
him
on
me
the
secretary
of
the
acme
club
warned
me
i
have
my
hands
full
an
i
if
i
been
in
condition
but
fifteen
pounds
off
without
trainin
condition
then
i
been
drinkin
pretty
regular
an
i
did
have
my
but
saxon
stripping
his
undershirt
no
longer
heard
him
as
with
his
face
she
could
not
recognize
his
splendidly
muscled
back
the
white
sheath
of
silken
skin
was
torn
and
bloody
the
lacerations
occurred
oftenest
in
horizontal
lines
though
there
were
perpendicular
lines
as
well
how
did
you
get
all
that
she
asked
the
ropes
i
was
up
against
more
times
than
i
like
to
remember
gee
he
certainly
gave
me
mine
but
i
fooled
he
could
put
me
out
i
lasted
the
twenty
rounds
an
i
wanta
tell
you
he
got
some
marks
to
remember
me
by
if
he
ai
got
a
couple
of
knuckles
broke
in
the
left
hand
i
a
here
feel
my
head
here
swollen
eh
sure
thing
he
hit
that
more
times
than
he
wishin
he
had
right
now
but
oh
what
a
lacin
what
a
lacin
i
never
had
anything
like
it
before
the
chicago
terror
they
call
i
take
my
hat
off
to
he
some
bear
but
i
could
take
the
count
if
i
ben
in
condition
an
had
my
oh
ouch
watch
out
it
like
a
boil
fumbling
at
his
waistband
saxon
hand
had
come
in
contact
with
a
brightly
inflamed
surface
larger
than
a
soup
plate
that
from
the
kidney
blows
billy
explained
he
was
a
regular
devil
at
it
every
clench
like
clock
work
down
he
chop
one
on
me
it
got
so
sore
i
was
wincin
until
i
got
groggy
an
did
know
much
of
anything
it
ai
a
knockout
blow
you
know
but
it
awful
wearin
in
a
long
fight
it
takes
the
starch
out
of
when
his
knees
were
bared
saxon
could
see
the
skin
across
the
was
broken
and
gone
the
skin
ai
made
to
stand
a
heavy
fellow
like
me
on
the
knees
he
volunteered
an
the
rosin
in
the
canvas
cuts
like
sam
the
tears
were
in
saxon
eyes
and
she
could
have
cried
over
the
manhandled
body
of
her
beautiful
sick
boy
as
she
carried
his
pants
across
the
room
to
hang
them
up
a
jingle
of
money
came
from
them
he
called
her
back
and
from
the
pocket
drew
forth
a
handful
of
silver
we
needed
the
money
we
needed
the
money
he
kept
muttering
as
he
vainly
tried
to
count
the
coins
and
saxon
knew
that
his
mind
was
wandering
again
it
cut
her
to
the
heart
for
she
could
not
but
remember
the
harsh
thoughts
that
had
threatened
her
loyalty
during
the
week
past
after
all
billy
the
splendid
physical
man
was
only
a
boy
her
boy
and
he
had
faced
and
endured
all
this
terrible
punishment
for
her
for
the
house
and
the
furniture
that
were
their
house
and
furniture
he
said
so
now
when
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
said
he
said
we
needed
the
she
was
not
so
absent
from
his
thoughts
as
she
had
fancied
here
down
to
the
naked
of
his
soul
when
he
was
half
unconscious
the
thought
of
her
persisted
was
uppermost
we
needed
the
money
we
the
tears
were
trickling
down
her
checks
as
she
bent
over
him
and
it
seemed
she
had
never
loved
him
so
much
as
now
here
you
count
he
said
abandoning
the
effort
and
handing
the
money
to
her
how
much
do
you
make
it
nineteen
dollars
and
that
right
the
loser
end
twenty
dollars
i
had
some
drinks
an
treated
a
couple
of
the
boys
an
then
there
was
carfare
if
i
a
hundred
that
what
i
fought
for
it
us
on
easy
street
for
a
while
you
take
it
an
keep
it
it
better
in
bed
he
could
not
sleep
because
of
his
pain
and
hour
by
hour
she
worked
over
him
renewing
the
hot
compresses
over
his
bruises
soothing
the
lacerations
with
witch
hazel
and
cold
cream
and
the
tenderest
of
finger
tips
and
all
the
while
with
broken
intervals
of
groaning
he
babbled
on
living
over
the
fight
seeking
relief
in
telling
her
his
trouble
voicing
regret
at
loss
of
the
money
and
crying
out
the
hurt
to
his
pride
far
worse
than
the
sum
of
his
physical
hurts
was
his
hurt
pride
he
could
put
me
out
anyway
he
had
full
swing
at
me
in
the
times
when
i
was
too
much
in
to
get
my
hands
up
the
crowd
was
crazy
i
showed
some
stamina
they
was
times
when
he
only
rocked
me
for
evaporated
plenty
of
his
steam
for
him
in
the
openin
rounds
i
know
how
many
times
he
dropped
me
things
was
gettin
too
dreamy
sometimes
toward
the
end
i
could
see
three
of
him
in
the
ring
at
once
an
i
would
know
which
to
hit
an
which
to
duck
but
i
fooled
when
i
could
see
or
feel
an
when
my
knees
was
shakin
an
my
head
goin
like
a
i
fall
safe
into
clenches

the
same
i

me

take
warnin
so
you

make
the
same
mistake

but
i
fooled
everybody

the
beginnin
the
bettin
was
even
by
the
sixth
round
the
wise
gazabos
was
offerin
two
to
one
against
me
i
was
licked
from
the
first
drop
outa
the
box
anybody
could
see
that
but
he
could
put
me
down
for
the
count
by
the
tenth
round
they
was
offerin
even
that
i
would
last
the
round
at
the
eleventh
they

fifteenth
an
i
lasted
the
whole
twenty
but

eight
an
got
up
stalled
an
covered
an
whanged
away
i
do
know
what
i
done
except
i
must
like
that
because
i
was
there
i
do
know
a
thing
from
the
thirteenth
when
he
sent
me
to
the
mat
on
my
head
till
the
eighteenth
where
was
i
oh
yes
i
opened
my
eyes
or
one
eye
because
i
had
only
one
that
would
open
an
there
i
was
in
my
corner
with
the
towels
goin
an
ammonia
in
my
nose
an
bill
murphy
with
a
chunk
of
ice
at
the
back
of
my
neck
an
there
across
the
ring
i
could
see
the
chicago
terror
an
i
had
to
do
some
thinkin
to
remember
i
was
fightin
him
it
was
like
i
been
away
somewhere
an
just
got
back
round
this
comin
i
ask
bill
eighteenth
says
he
hell
i
says
come
of
all
the
other
rounds
the
last
i
was
fightin
in
was
the
thirteenth
a
wonder
says
bill
ben
out
four
rounds
only
nobody
knows
it
except
me
i
ben
tryin
to
get
you
to
quit
all
the
time
just
then
the
gong
sounds
an
i
can
see
the
terror
for
me
says
bill
makin
a
move
to
throw
in
the
towel
on
your
life
i
says
it
bill
but
he
went
on
wantin
me
to
quit
by
that
time
the
terror
had
come
across
to
my
corner
an
was
with
his
hands
down
lookin
at
me
the
referee
was
lookin
too
the
house
was
that
quiet
lookin
you
could
hear
a
pin
drop
an
my
head
was
gettin
some
clearer
but
not
much
ca
win
bill
says
me
says
i
an
with
that
i
make
a
rush
for
the
terror
catchin
him
unexpected
i
that
groggy
i
ca
stand
but
i
just
keep
wallopin
the
terror
clear
across
the
ring
to
his
corner
where
he
slips
an
falls
an
i
fall
on
top
of
say
that
crowd
goes
crazy
where
was
i
my
head
still
goin
round
i
guess
it
buzzin
like
a
swarm
of
you
just
fallen
on
top
of
him
in
his
corner
saxon
prompted
oh
yes
well
no
sooner
are
we
on
our
feet
an
i
ca
stand
i
rush
the
same
way
back
across
to
my
corner
an
fall
on
that
was
luck
we
got
up
an
i
only
i
clenched
an
held
myself
up
by
him
got
your
goat
i
says
to
him
now
i
goin
to
eat
you
up
i
had
his
goat
but
i
was
playin
to
get
a
piece
of
it
an
i
got
it
rushin
as
soon
as
the
referee
drags
us
apart
an
fetchin
a
lucky
wallop
in
the
stomach
that
steadied
an
made
him
almighty
careful
too
almighty
careful
he
was
afraid
to
chance
a
mix
with
me
he
thought
i
had
more
fight
left
in
me
than
i
had
so
you
see
i
got
that
much
of
his
goat
anyway
an
he
could
get
me
he
did
get
me
an
in
the
twentieth
we
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
an
exchanged
wallops
even
of
course
made
a
fine
showin
for
a
licked
man
but
he
got
the
decision
which
was
right
but
i
fooled
he
could
get
me
an
i
fooled
the
gazabos
that
was
bettin
he
would
on
short
at
last
as
dawn
came
on
billy
slept
he
groaned
and
moaned
his
face
twisting
with
pain
his
body
vainly
moving
and
tossing
in
quest
of
easement
so
this
was
prizefighting
saxon
thought
it
was
much
worse
than
she
had
dreamed
she
had
had
no
idea
that
such
damage
could
be
wrought
with
padded
gloves
he
must
never
fight
again
street
rioting
was
preferable
she
was
wondering
how
much
of
his
silk
had
been
lost
when
he
mumbled
and
opened
his
eyes
what
is
it
she
asked
ere
it
came
to
her
that
his
eyes
were
unseeing
and
that
he
was
in
delirium
saxon
saxon
he
called
yes
billy
what
is
it
his
hand
fumbled
over
the
bed
where
ordinarily
it
would
have
encountered
her
again
he
called
her
and
she
cried
her
presence
loudly
in
his
ear
he
sighed
with
relief
and
muttered
brokenly
i
had
to
do
it
we
needed
the
his
eyes
closed
and
he
slept
more
soundly
though
his
muttering
continued
she
had
heard
of
congestion
of
the
brain
and
was
frightened
then
she
remembered
his
telling
her
of
the
ice
billy
murphy
had
held
against
his
head
throwing
a
shawl
over
her
head
she
ran
to
the
pile
drivers
home
on
seventh
street
the
barkeeper
had
just
opened
and
was
sweeping
out
from
the
refrigerator
he
gave
her
all
the
ice
she
wished
to
carry
breaking
it
into
convenient
pieces
for
her
back
in
the
house
she
applied
the
ice
to
the
base
of
billy
brain
placed
hot
irons
to
his
feet
and
bathed
his
head
with
witch
hazel
made
cold
by
resting
on
the
ice
he
slept
in
the
darkened
room
until
late
afternoon
when
to
dismay
he
insisted
on
getting
up
got
ta
make
a
showin
he
explained
they
ai
goin
to
have
the
laugh
on
in
torment
he
was
helped
by
her
to
dress
and
in
torment
he
went
forth
from
the
house
so
that
his
world
should
have
ocular
evidence
that
the
beating
he
had
received
did
not
keep
him
in
bed
it
was
another
kind
of
pride
different
from
a
woman
and
saxon
wondered
if
it
were
the
less
admirable
for
that
chapter
xiv
in
the
days
that
followed
billy
swellings
went
down
and
the
bruises
passed
away
with
surprising
rapidity
the
quick
healing
of
the
lacerations
attested
the
healthiness
of
his
blood
only
remained
the
black
eyes
unduly
conspicuous
on
a
face
as
blond
as
his
the
discoloration
was
stubborn
persisting
half
a
month
in
which
time
happened
divers
events
of
importance
otto
frank
trial
had
been
expeditious
found
guilty
by
a
jury
notable
for
the
business
and
professional
men
on
it
the
death
sentence
was
passed
upon
him
and
he
was
removed
to
san
quentin
for
execution
the
case
of
chester
johnson
and
the
fourteen
others
had
taken
longer
but
within
the
same
week
it
too
was
finished
chester
johnson
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
two
got
life
three
twenty
years
only
two
were
acquitted
the
remaining
seven
received
terms
of
from
two
to
ten
years
the
effect
on
saxon
was
to
throw
her
into
deep
depression
billy
was
made
gloomy
but
his
fighting
spirit
was
not
subdued
always
some
men
killed
in
battle
he
said
that
to
be
expected
but
the
way
of
sentencin
gets
me
all
found
guilty
was
responsible
for
the
killin
or
none
was
responsible
if
all
was
then
they
should
get
the
same
sentence
they
oughta
hang
like
chester
johnson
or
else
he
ought
to
hang
i
just
like
to
know
how
the
judge
makes
up
his
mind
it
must
be
like
markin
china
lottery
tickets
he
plays
hunches
he
looks
at
a
guy
an
waits
for
a
spot
or
a
number
to
come
into
his
head
how
else
could
he
give
johnny
black
four
years
an
cal
hutchins
twenty
years
he
played
the
hunches
as
they
came
into
his
head
an
it
might
just
as
easy
ben
the
other
way
around
an
cal
hutchins
got
four
years
an
johnny
black
twenty
i
know
both
them
boys
they
hung
out
with
the
tenth
an
kirkham
gang
mostly
though
sometimes
they
ran
with
my
gang
we
used
to
go
after
school
down
to
sandy
beach
on
the
marsh
an
in
the
transit
slip
where
they
said
the
water
was
sixty
feet
deep
only
it
was
an
once
on
a
thursday
we
dug
a
lot
of
clams
together
an
played
hookey
friday
to
peddle
them
an
we
used
to
go
out
on
the
rock
wall
an
catch
pogies
an
rock
cod
one
day
the
day
of
the
eclipse
cal
caught
a
perch
half
as
big
as
a
door
i
never
seen
such
a
fish
an
now
he
got
to
wear
the
stripes
for
twenty
years
lucky
he
was
married
if
he
do
get
the
consumption
he
be
an
old
man
when
he
comes
out
cal
mother
let
go
swimmin
an
whenever
she
suspected
she
always
licked
his
hair
with
her
tongue
if
it
tasted
salty
he
got
a
beltin
but
he
was
onto
himself
comin
home
he
jump
somebody
front
fence
an
hold
his
head
under
a
i
used
to
dance
with
chester
johnson
saxon
said
and
i
knew
his
wife
kittie
brady
long
and
long
ago
she
had
next
place
at
the
table
to
me
in
the
factory
she
gone
to
san
francisco
to
her
married
sister
she
going
to
have
a
baby
too
she
was
awfully
pretty
and
there
was
always
a
string
of
fellows
after
the
effect
of
the
conviction
and
severe
sentences
was
a
bad
one
on
the
union
men
instead
of
being
disheartening
it
intensified
the
bitterness
billy
repentance
for
having
fought
and
the
sweetness
and
affection
which
had
flashed
up
in
the
days
of
saxon
nursing
of
him
were
blotted
out
at
home
he
scowled
and
brooded
while
his
talk
took
on
the
tone
of
bert
in
the
last
days
ere
that
mohegan
died
also
billy
stayed
away
from
home
longer
hours
and
was
again
steadily
drinking
saxon
abandoned
hope
almost
was
she
steeled
to
the
inevitable
tragedy
which
her
morbid
fancy
painted
in
a
thousand
guises
oftenest
it
was
of
billy
being
brought
home
on
a
stretcher
sometimes
it
was
a
call
to
the
telephone
in
the
corner
grocery
and
the
curt
information
by
a
strange
voice
that
her
husband
was
lying
in
the
receiving
hospital
or
the
morgue
and
when
the
mysterious
cases
occurred
and
when
the
residence
of
one
of
the
teaming
magnates
was
half
destroyed
by
dynamite
she
saw
billy
in
prison
or
wearing
stripes
or
mounting
to
the
scaffold
at
san
quentin
while
at
the
same
time
she
could
see
the
little
cottage
on
pine
street
besieged
by
newspaper
reporters
and
photographers
yet
her
lively
imagination
failed
altogether
to
anticipate
the
real
catastrophe
harmon
the
fireman
lodger
passing
through
the
kitchen
on
his
way
out
to
work
had
paused
to
tell
saxon
about
the
previous
in
the
alviso
marshes
and
of
how
the
engineer
imprisoned
under
the
overturned
engine
and
unhurt
being
drowned
by
the
rising
tide
had
begged
to
be
shot
billy
came
in
at
the
end
of
the
narrative
and
from
the
somber
light
in
his
eyes
saxon
knew
he
had
been
drinking
he
glowered
at
harmon
and
without
greeting
to
him
or
saxon
leaned
his
shoulder
against
the
wall
harmon
felt
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
and
did
his
best
to
appear
oblivious
i
was
just
telling
your
wife
he
began
but
was
savagely
interrupted
i
do
care
what
you
was
tellin
her
but
i
got
something
to
tell
you
mister
man
my
wife
made
up
your
bed
too
many
times
to
suit
billy
saxon
cried
her
face
scarlet
with
resentment
and
hurt
and
shame
billy
ignored
her
harmon
was
saying
i
do
understand
well
i
do
like
your
mug
billy
informed
him
you
standin
on
your
foot
get
off
of
it
get
out
beat
it
d
understand
that
i
do
know
what
got
into
him
saxon
gasped
hurriedly
to
the
fireman
he
not
himself
oh
i
am
so
ashamed
so
billy
turned
on
her
you
shut
your
mouth
an
keep
outa
but
billy
she
remonstrated
an
get
outa
here
you
go
into
the
other
here
now
harmon
broke
in
this
is
a
fine
way
to
treat
a
i
given
you
too
much
rope
as
it
is
was
billy
answer
i
paid
my
rent
regularly
have
i
an
i
oughta
knock
your
block
off
for
you
do
see
any
reason
i
should
for
that
if
you
do
anything
like
that
billy
saxon
began
you
here
still
well
if
you
wo
go
into
the
other
room
i
see
that
you
his
hand
clutched
her
arm
for
one
instant
she
resisted
his
strength
and
in
that
instant
the
flesh
crushed
under
his
fingers
she
realized
the
fullness
of
his
strength
in
the
front
room
she
could
only
lie
back
in
the
morris
chair
sobbing
and
listen
to
what
occurred
in
the
kitchen
i
stay
to
the
end
of
the
week
the
fireman
was
saying
i
paid
in
do
make
no
mistake
came
billy
voice
so
slow
that
it
was
almost
a
drawl
yet
quivering
with
rage
you
ca
get
out
too
quick
if
you
wanta
stay
healthy
you
an
your
traps
with
you
i
likely
to
start
something
any
oh
i
know
you
a
slugger
the
fireman
voice
began
then
came
the
unmistakable
impact
of
a
blow
the
crash
of
glass
a
scuffle
on
the
back
porch
and
finally
the
heavy
bumps
of
a
body
down
the
steps
she
heard
billy
reenter
the
kitchen
move
about
and
knew
he
was
sweeping
up
the
broken
glass
of
the
kitchen
door
then
he
washed
himself
at
the
sink
whistling
while
he
dried
his
face
and
hands
and
walked
into
the
front
room
she
did
not
look
at
him
she
was
too
sick
and
sad
he
paused
irresolutely
seeming
to
make
up
his
mind
i
goin
up
town
he
stated
they
a
meeting
of
the
union
if
i
do
come
back
it
be
because
that
geezer
sworn
out
a
he
opened
the
front
door
and
paused
she
knew
he
was
looking
at
her
then
the
door
closed
and
she
heard
him
go
down
the
steps
saxon
was
stunned
she
did
not
think
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
the
whole
thing
was
incomprehensible
incredible
she
lay
back
in
the
chair
her
eyes
closed
her
mind
almost
a
blank
crushed
by
a
leaden
feeling
that
the
end
had
come
to
everything
the
voices
of
children
playing
in
the
street
aroused
her
night
had
fallen
she
groped
her
way
to
a
lamp
and
lighted
it
in
the
kitchen
she
stared
lips
trembling
at
the
pitiful
half
prepared
meal
the
fire
had
gone
out
the
water
had
boiled
away
from
the
potatoes
when
she
lifted
the
lid
a
burnt
smell
arose
methodically
she
scraped
and
cleaned
the
pot
put
things
in
order
and
peeled
and
sliced
the
potatoes
for
next
day
frying
and
just
as
methodically
she
went
to
bed
her
lack
of
nervousness
her
placidity
was
abnormal
so
abnormal
that
she
closed
her
eyes
and
was
almost
immediately
asleep
nor
did
she
awaken
till
the
sunshine
was
streaming
into
the
room
it
was
the
first
night
she
and
billy
had
slept
apart
she
was
amazed
that
she
had
not
lain
awake
worrying
about
him
she
lay
with
eyes
wide
open
scarcely
thinking
until
pain
in
her
arm
attracted
her
attention
it
was
where
billy
had
gripped
her
on
examination
she
found
the
bruised
flesh
fearfully
black
and
blue
she
was
astonished
not
by
the
spiritual
fact
that
such
bruise
had
been
administered
by
the
one
she
loved
most
in
the
world
but
by
the
sheer
physical
fact
that
an
instant
pressure
had
inflicted
so
much
damage
the
strength
of
a
man
was
a
terrible
thing
quite
impersonally
she
found
herself
wondering
if
charley
long
were
as
strong
as
billy
it
was
not
until
she
dressed
and
built
the
fire
that
she
began
to
think
about
more
immediate
things
billy
had
not
returned
then
he
was
arrested
what
was
she
to
do
leave
him
in
jail
go
away
and
start
life
afresh
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
living
with
a
man
who
had
behaved
as
he
had
but
then
came
another
thought
was
it
impossible
after
all
he
was
her
husband
for
better
or
worse
the
phrase
reiterated
itself
a
monotonous
accompaniment
to
her
thoughts
at
the
back
of
her
consciousness
to
leave
him
was
to
surrender
she
carried
the
matter
before
the
tribunal
of
her
mother
memory
no
daisy
would
never
have
surrendered
daisy
was
a
fighter
then
she
saxon
must
fight
besides
and
she
acknowledged
it
readily
though
in
a
cold
dead
way
besides
billy
was
better
than
most
husbands
better
than
any
other
husband
she
had
heard
of
she
concluded
as
she
remembered
many
of
his
earlier
nicenesses
and
finenesses
and
especially
his
eternal
chant
nothing
is
too
good
for
us
the
robertses
ai
on
the
cheap
at
eleven
she
had
a
caller
it
was
bud
strothers
billy
mate
on
strike
duty
billy
he
told
her

refused
bail
refused
a
lawyer

asked
to
be
tried
by
the
court
had
pleaded
guilty
and
had
received
a
sentence
of
sixty
dollars
or
thirty
days
also
he
had
refused
to
let
the
boys
pay
his
fine
he
clean

proudly
she
disclaimed
any
need
for
money
and
not
until
her
visitor
departed
did
she
read
billy
note
dear
saxon
bud
strothers

yourself
that

me
this
time
and
you
wo

again
billy
bud
strothers
was
followed
by
maggie
donahue
and
olsen
who
paid
neighborly
calls
of
cheer
and
were
tactful
in
their
offers
of
help
and
in
studiously
avoiding
more
reference
than
was
necessary
to
predicament
in
the
afternoon
james
harmon
arrived
he
limped
slightly
and
saxon
divined
that
he
was
doing
his
best
to
minimize
that
evidence
of
hurt
she
tried
to
apologize
to
him
but
he
would
not
listen
i
do
blame
you
roberts
he
said
i
know
it
was
your
doing
but
your
husband
was
just
himself
i
guess
he
was
mad
on
general
principles
and
it
was
just
my
luck
to
get
in
the
way
that
was
but
just
the
same
the
fireman
shook
his
head
i
know
all
about
it
i
used
to
punish
the
drink
myself
and
i
done
some
funny
things
in
them
days
and
i
sorry
i
swore
that
warrant
out
and
testified
but
i
was
hot
in
the
collar
i
cooled
down
now
an
sorry
i
done
you
awfully
good
and
kind
she
said
and
then
began
hesitantly
on
what
was
bothering
her
you
you
ca
stay
now
with
him
away
you
yes
that
would
do
would
it
i
tell
you
i
pack
up
right
now
and
skin
out
and
then
before
six
i
send
a
wagon
for
my
things
here
the
key
to
the
kitchen
much
as
he
demurred
she
compelled
him
to
receive
back
the
unexpired
portion
of
his
rent
he
shook
her
hand
heartily
at
leaving
and
tried
to
get
her
to
promise
to
call
upon
him
for
a
loan
any
time
she
might
be
in
need
it
all
right
he
assured
her
i
married
and
got
two
boys
one
of
them
got
his
lungs
touched
and
she
with
down
in
arizona
out
the
railroad
helped
with
and
as
he
went
down
the
steps
she
wondered
that
so
kind
a
man
should
be
in
so
madly
cruel
a
world
the
donahue
boy
threw
in
a
spare
evening
paper
and
saxon
found
half
a
column
devoted
to
billy
it
was
not
nice
the
fact
that
he
had
stood
up
in
the
police
court
with
his
eyes
blacked
from
some
other
fray
was
noted
he
was
described
as
a
bully
a
hoodlum
a
a
professional
slugger
whose
presence
in
the
ranks
was
a
disgrace
to
organized
labor
the
assault
he
had
pleaded
guilty
of
was
atrocious
and
unprovoked
and
if
he
were
a
fair
sample
of
a
striking
teamster
the
only
wise
thing
for
oakland
to
do
was
to
break
up
the
union
and
drive
every
member
from
the
city
and
finally
the
paper
complained
at
the
mildness
of
the
sentence
it
should
have
been
six
months
at
least
the
judge
was
quoted
as
expressing
regret
that
he
had
been
unable
to
impose
a
six
months
sentence
this
inability
being
due
to
the
condition
of
the
jails
already
crowded
beyond
capacity
by
the
many
cases
of
assault
committed
in
the
course
of
the
various
strikes
that
night
in
bed
saxon
experienced
her
first
loneliness
her
brain
seemed
in
a
whirl
and
her
sleep
was
broken
by
vain
gropings
for
the
form
of
billy
she
imagined
at
her
side
at
last
she
lighted
the
lamp
and
lay
staring
at
the
ceiling
conning
over
and
over
the
details
of
the
disaster
that
had
overwhelmed
her
she
could
forgive
and
she
could
not
forgive
the
blow
to
her
had
been
too
savage
too
brutal
her
pride
was
too
lacerated
to
permit
her
wholly
to
return
in
memory
to
the
other
billy
whom
she
loved
wine
in
wit
out
she
repeated
to
herself
but
the
phrase
could
not
absolve
the
man
who
had
slept
by
her
side
and
to
whom
she
had
consecrated
herself
she
wept
in
the
loneliness
of
the
bed
strove
to
forget
incomprehensible
cruelty
even
pillowed
her
cheek
with
numb
fondness
against
the
bruise
of
her
arm
but
still
resentment
burned
within
her
a
steady
flame
of
protest
against
billy
and
all
that
billy
had
done
her
throat
was
parched
a
dull
ache
never
ceased
in
her
breast
and
she
was
oppressed
by
a
feeling
of
goneness
why
why
and
from
the
puzzle
of
the
world
came
no
solution
in
the
morning
she
received
a
visit
from
sarah
the
second
in
all
the
period
of
her
marriage
and
she
could
easily
guess
her
ghoulish
errand
no
exertion
was
required
for
the
assertion
of
all
of
saxon
pride
she
refused
to
be
in
the
slightest
on
the
defensive
there
was
nothing
to
defend
nothing
to
explain
everything
was
all
right
and
it
was
nobody
business
anyway
this
attitude
but
served
to
vex
sarah
i
warned
you
and
you
ca
say
i
did
her
diatribe
ran
i
always
knew
he
was
no
good
a
jailbird
a
hoodlum
a
slugger
my
heart
sunk
into
my
boots
when
i
heard
you
was
runnin
with
a
prizefighter
i
told
you
so
at
the
time
but
no
you
would
listen
you
with
your
highfalutin
notions
an
more
pairs
of
shoes
than
any
decent
woman
should
have
you
knew
me
an
i
said
then
to
tom
i
said
all
up
with
saxon
now
them
was
my
very
words
them
that
touches
pitch
is
defiled
if
you
only
charley
long
then
the
family
would
disgraced
an
this
is
only
the
beginnin
mark
me
only
the
beginnin
where
it
end
god
knows
he
kill
somebody
yet
that
of
yourn
an
be
hanged
for
it
you
wait
an
see
that
all
an
then
you
remember
my
words
as
you
make
your
bed
so
you
will
lay
in
it
best
bed
i
ever
had
saxon
commented
so
you
can
say
so
you
can
say
sarah
snorted
i
would
trade
it
for
a
queen
bed
saxon
added
a
jailbird
bed
sarah
rejoined
witheringly
oh
it
the
style
saxon
retorted
airily
everybody
getting
a
taste
of
jail
was
tom
arrested
at
some
street
meeting
of
the
socialists
everybody
goes
to
jail
these
the
barb
had
struck
home
but
tom
was
acquitted
sarah
hastened
to
proclaim
just
the
same
he
lay
in
jail
all
night
without
this
was
unanswerable
and
sarah
executed
her
favorite
tactic
of
attack
in
flank
a
nice
for
you
i
must
say
that
was
raised
straight
right
up
didoes
with
a
who
says
so
saxon
blazed
with
an
indignation
quickly
mastered
oh
a
blind
man
can
read
between
the
lines
a
lodger
a
young
married
woman
with
no
self
respect
an
a
prizefighter
for
a
husband
what
else
would
they
fight
about
just
like
any
family
quarrel
was
it
saxon
smiled
placidly
sarah
was
shocked
into
momentary
speechlessness
and
i
want
you
to
understand
it
saxon
continued
it
makes
a
woman
proud
to
have
men
fight
over
her
i
am
proud
do
you
hear
i
am
proud
i
want
you
to
tell
them
so
i
want
you
to
tell
all
your
neighbors
tell
everybody
i
am
no
cow
men
like
me
men
fight
for
me
men
go
to
jail
for
me
what
is
a
woman
in
the
world
for
if
it
is
to
have
men
like
her
now
go
sarah
go
at
once
and
tell
everybody
what
you
read
between
the
lines
tell
them
billy
is
a
jailbird
and
that
i
am
a
bad
woman
whom
all
men
desire
shout
it
out
and
good
luck
to
you
and
get
out
of
my
house
and
never
put
your
feet
in
it
again
you
are
too
decent
a
woman
to
come
here
you
might
lose
your
reputation
and
think
of
your
children
now
get
out
not
until
sarah
had
taken
an
amazed
and
horrified
departure
did
saxon
fling
herself
on
the
bed
in
a
convulsion
of
tears
she
had
been
ashamed
before
merely
of
billy
inhospitality
and
surliness
and
unfairness
but
she
could
see
now
the
light
in
which
others
looked
on
the
affair
it
had
not
entered
saxon
head
she
was
confident
that
it
had
not
entered
billy
she
knew
his
attitude
from
the
first
always
he
had
opposed
taking
a
lodger
because
of
his
proud
faith
that
his
wife
should
not
work
only
hard
times
had
compelled
his
consent
and
now
that
she
looked
back
almost
had
she
inveigled
him
into
consenting
but
all
this
did
not
alter
the
viewpoint
the
neighborhood
must
hold
that
every
one
who
had
ever
known
her
must
hold
and
for
this
too
billy
was
responsible
it
was
more
terrible
than
all
the
other
things
he
had
been
guilty
of
put
together
she
could
never
look
any
one
in
the
face
again
maggie
donahue
and
olsen
had
been
very
kind
but
of
what
must
they
have
been
thinking
all
the
time
they
talked
with
her
and
what
must
they
have
said
to
each
other
what
was
everybody
saying
over
front
gates
and
back
fences
the
men
standing
on
the
corners
or
talking
in
saloons
later
exhausted
by
her
grief
when
the
tears
no
longer
fell
she
grew
more
impersonal
and
dwelt
on
the
disasters
that
had
befallen
so
many
women
since
the
strike
troubles
began
otto
frank
wife
widow
pretty
kittie
brady
mary
all
the
womenfolk
of
the
other
workmen
who
were
now
wearing
the
stripes
in
san
quentin
her
world
was
crashing
about
her
ears
no
one
was
exempt
not
only
had
she
not
escaped
but
hers
was
the
worst
disgrace
of
all
desperately
she
tried
to
hug
the
delusion
that
she
was
asleep
that
it
was
all
a
nightmare
and
that
soon
the
alarm
would
go
off
and
she
would
get
up
and
cook
billy
breakfast
so
that
he
could
go
to
work
she
did
not
leave
the
bed
that
day
nor
did
she
sleep
her
brain
whirled
on
and
on
now
dwelling
at
insistent
length
upon
her
misfortunes
now
pursuing
the
most
fantastic
ramifications
of
what
she
considered
her
disgrace
and
again
going
back
to
her
childhood
and
wandering
through
endless
trivial
detail
she
worked
at
all
the
tasks
she
had
ever
done
performing
in
fancy
the
myriads
of
mechanical
movements
peculiar
to
each
occupation
shaping
and
pasting
in
the
paper
box
factory
ironing
in
the
laundry
weaving
in
the
jute
mill
peeling
fruit
in
the
cannery
and
countless
boxes
of
scalded
tomatoes
she
attended
all
her
dances
and
all
her
picnics
over
again
went
through
her
school
days
recalling
the
face
and
name
and
seat
of
every
schoolmate
endured
the
gray
bleakness
of
the
years
in
the
orphan
asylum
revisioned
every
memory
of
her
mother
every
tale
and
relived
all
her
life
with
billy
but
ever
and
here
the
torment
lay
she
was
drawn
back
from
these
to
her
present
trouble
with
its
parch
in
the
throat
its
ache
in
the
breast
and
its
gnawing
vacant
goneness
chapter
xv
all
that
night
saxon
lay
unsleeping
without
taking
off
her
clothes
and
when
she
arose
in
the
morning
and
washed
her
face
and
dressed
her
hair
she
was
aware
of
a
strange
numbness
of
a
feeling
of
constriction
about
her
head
as
if
it
were
bound
by
a
heavy
band
of
iron
it
seemed
like
a
dull
pressure
upon
her
brain
it
was
the
beginning
of
an
illness
that
she
did
not
know
as
illness
all
she
knew
was
that
she
felt
queer
it
was
not
fever
it
was
not
cold
her
bodily
health
was
as
it
should
be
and
when
she
thought
about
it
she
put
her
condition
down
to
nerves
nerves
according
to
her
ideas
and
the
ideas
of
her
class
being
unconnected
with
disease
she
had
a
strange
feeling
of
loss
of
self
of
being
a
stranger
to
herself
and
the
world
in
which
she
moved
seemed
a
vague
and
shrouded
world
it
lacked
sharpness
of
definition
its
customary
vividness
was
gone
she
had
lapses
of
memory
and
was
continually
finding
herself
doing
unplanned
things
thus
to
her
astonishment
she
came
to
in
the
back
yard
hanging
up
the
week
she
had
no
recollection
of
having
done
it
yet
it
had
been
done
precisely
as
it
should
have
been
done
she
had
boiled
the
sheets
and
and
the
table
linen
woolens
had
been
washed
in
warm
water
only
with
the
soap
the
recipe
of
which
mercedes
had
given
her
on
investigation
she
found
she
had
eaten
a
mutton
chop
for
breakfast
this
meant
that
she
had
been
to
the
butcher
shop
yet
she
had
no
memory
of
having
gone
curiously
she
went
into
the
bedroom
the
bed
was
made
up
and
everything
in
order
at
twilight
she
came
upon
herself
in
the
front
room
seated
by
the
window
crying
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
at
first
she
did
not
know
what
this
joy
was
then
it
came
to
her
that
it
was
because
she
had
lost
her
baby
a
blessing
a
blessing
she
was
chanting
aloud
wringing
her
hands
but
with
joy
she
knew
it
was
with
joy
that
she
wrung
her
hands
the
days
came
and
went
she
had
little
notion
of
time
sometimes
centuries
agone
it
seemed
to
her
it
was
since
billy
had
gone
to
jail
at
other
times
it
was
no
more
than
the
night
before
but
through
it
all
two
ideas
persisted
she
must
not
go
to
see
billy
in
jail
it
was
a
blessing
she
had
lost
her
baby
once
bud
strothers
came
to
see
her
she
sat
in
the
front
room
and
talked
with
him
noting
with
fascination
that
there
were
fringes
to
the
heels
of
his
trousers
another
day
the
business
agent
of
the
union
called
she
told
him
as
she
had
told
bud
strothers
that
everything
was
all
right
that
she
needed
nothing
that
she
could
get
along
comfortably
until
billy
came
out
a
fear
began
to
haunt
her
when
he
came
out
no
it
must
not
be
there
must
not
be
another
baby
it
might
live
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
it
must
not
be
she
would
run
away
first
she
would
never
see
billy
again
anything
but
that
anything
but
that
this
fear
persisted
in
her
sleep
it
became
an
accomplished
fact
so
that
she
would
awake
trembling
in
a
cold
sweat
crying
out
her
sleep
had
become
wretched
sometimes
she
was
convinced
that
she
did
not
sleep
at
all
and
she
knew
that
she
had
insomnia
and
remembered
that
it
was
of
insomnia
her
mother
had
died
she
came
to
herself
one
day
sitting
in
doctor
hentley
office
he
was
looking
at
her
in
a
puzzled
way
got
plenty
to
eat
he
was
asking
she
nodded
any
serious
trouble
she
shook
her
head
everything
all
right
doctor
except
yes
yes
he
encouraged
and
then
she
knew
why
she
had
come
simply
explicitly
she
told
him
he
shook
his
head
slowly
it
ca
be
done
little
woman
he
said
oh
but
it
can
she
cried
i
know
it
i
do
mean
that
he
answered
i
mean
i
ca
tell
you
i
dare
not
it
is
against
the
law
there
is
a
doctor
in
leavenworth
prison
right
now
for
in
vain
she
pleaded
with
him
he
instanced
his
own
wife
and
children
whose
existence
forbade
his
imperiling
besides
there
is
no
likelihood
now
he
told
her
but
there
will
be
there
is
sure
to
be
she
urged
but
he
could
only
shake
his
head
sadly
why
do
you
want
to
know
he
questioned
finally
saxon
poured
her
heart
out
to
him
she
told
of
her
first
year
of
happiness
with
billy
of
the
hard
times
caused
by
the
labor
troubles
of
the
change
in
billy
so
that
there
was
no
left
of
her
own
deep
horror
not
if
it
died
she
concluded
she
could
go
through
that
again
but
if
it
should
live
billy
would
soon
be
out
of
jail
and
then
the
danger
would
begin
it
was
only
a
few
words
she
would
never
tell
any
one
wild
horses
could
not
drag
it
out
of
her
but
doctor
hentley
continued
to
shake
his
head
i
ca
tell
you
little
woman
it
a
shame
but
i
ca
take
the
risk
my
hands
are
tied
our
laws
are
all
wrong
i
have
to
consider
those
who
are
dear
to
it
was
when
she
got
up
to
go
that
he
faltered
come
here
he
said
sit
he
prepared
to
whisper
in
her
ear
then
with
a
sudden
excess
of
caution
crossed
the
room
swiftly
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
when
he
sat
down
again
he
drew
his
chair
so
close
to
hers
that
the
arms
touched
and
when
he
whispered
his
beard
tickled
her
ear
no
no
he
shut
her
off
when
she
tried
to
voice
her
gratitude
i
have
told
you
nothing
you
were
here
to
consult
me
about
your
general
health
you
are
run
down
out
of
condition
as
he
talked
he
moved
her
toward
the
door
when
he
opened
it
a
patient
for
the
dentist
in
the
adjoining
office
was
standing
in
the
hall
doctor
hentley
lifted
his
voice
what
you
need
is
that
tonic
i
prescribed
remember
that
and
pamper
your
appetite
when
it
comes
back
eat
strong
nourishing
food
and
beefsteak
plenty
of
beefsteak
and
do
cook
it
to
a
cinder
good
at
times
the
silent
cottage
became
unendurable
and
saxon
would
throw
a
shawl
about
her
head
and
walk
out
the
oakland
mole
or
cross
the
railroad
yards
and
the
marshes
to
sandy
beach
where
billy
had
said
he
used
to
swim
also
by
going
out
the
transit
slip
by
climbing
down
the
piles
on
a
precarious
ladder
of
iron
spikes
and
by
crossing
a
boom
of
logs
she
won
access
to
the
rock
wall
that
extended
far
out
into
the
bay
and
that
served
as
a
barrier
between
the
mudflats
and
the
channel
of
oakland
estuary
here
the
fresh
sea
breezes
blew
and
oakland
sank
down
to
a
smudge
of
smoke
behind
her
while
across
the
bay
she
could
see
the
smudge
that
represented
san
francisco
ocean
steamships
passed
up
and
down
the
estuary
and
ships
towed
by
tugs
she
gazed
at
the
sailors
on
the
ships
wondered
on
what
far
voyages
and
to
what
far
lands
they
went
wondered
what
freedoms
were
theirs
or
were
they
girt
in
by
as
remorseless
and
cruel
a
world
as
the
dwellers
in
oakland
were
were
they
as
unfair
as
unjust
as
brutal
in
their
dealings
with
their
fellows
as
were
the
city
dwellers
it
did
not
seem
so
and
sometimes
she
wished
herself
on
board
going
anywhere
she
cared
not
where
so
long
as
it
was
away
from
the
world
to
which
she
had
given
her
best
and
which
had
trampled
her
in
return
she
did
not
know
always
when
she
left
the
house
nor
where
her
feet
took
her
once
she
came
to
herself
in
a
strange
part
of
oakland
the
street
was
wide
and
lined
with
rows
of
shade
trees
velvet
lawns
broken
only
by
cement
sidewalks
ran
down
to
the
gutters
the
houses
stood
apart
and
were
large
in
her
vocabulary
they
were
mansions
what
had
shocked
her
to
consciousness
of
herself
was
a
young
man
in
the
driver
seat
of
a
touring
car
standing
at
the
curb
he
was
looking
at
her
curiously
and
she
recognized
him
as
roy
blanchard
whom
in
front
of
the
forum
billy
had
threatened
to
whip
beside
the
car
bareheaded
stood
another
young
man
he
too
she
remembered
he
it
was
at
the
sunday
picnic
where
she
first
met
billy
who
had
thrust
his
cane
between
the
legs
of
the
flying
and
precipitated
the
fight
like
blanchard
he
was
looking
at
her
curiously
and
she
became
aware
that
she
had
been
talking
to
herself
the
babble
of
her
lips
still
beat
in
her
ears
she
blushed
a
rising
tide
of
shame
heating
her
face
and
quickened
her
pace
blanchard
sprang
out
of
the
car
and
came
to
her
with
lifted
hat
is
anything
the
matter
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
and
though
she
had
stopped
she
evinced
her
desire
to
go
on
i
know
you
he
said
studying
her
face
you
were
with
the
striker
who
promised
me
a
he
is
my
husband
she
said
oh
good
for
he
regarded
her
pleasantly
and
frankly
but
about
yourself
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
something
is
the
no
i
all
right
she
answered
i
have
been
sick
she
lied
for
she
never
dreamed
of
connecting
her
queerness
with
sickness
you
look
tired
he
pressed
her
i
can
take
you
in
the
machine
and
run
you
anywhere
you
want
it
wo
be
any
trouble
i
plenty
of
saxon
shook
her
head
if
if
you
would
tell
me
where
i
can
catch
the
eighth
street
cars
i
do
often
come
to
this
part
of
he
told
her
where
to
find
an
electric
car
and
what
transfers
to
make
and
she
was
surprised
at
the
distance
she
had
wandered
thank
you
she
said
and
good
sure
i
ca
do
anything
now
well
good
bye
he
smiled
good
humoredly
and
tell
that
husband
of
yours
to
keep
in
good
condition
i
likely
to
make
him
need
it
all
when
he
tangles
up
with
oh
but
you
ca
fight
with
him
she
warned
you
must
you
have
got
a
good
for
you
he
admired
that
the
way
for
a
woman
to
stand
up
for
her
man
now
the
average
woman
would
be
so
afraid
he
was
going
to
get
licked
but
i
not
afraid
for
him
it
for
you
he
a
terrible
fighter
you
would
have
any
chance
it
would
be
like
like
like
taking
candy
from
a
baby
blanchard
finished
for
her
yes
she
nodded
that
just
what
he
would
call
it
and
whenever
he
tells
you
you
are
standing
on
your
foot
watch
out
for
him
now
i
must
go
good
bye
and
thank
you
she
went
on
down
the
sidewalk
his
cheery
good
bye
ringing
in
her
ears
he
was
kind
she
admitted
it
honestly
yet
he
was
one
of
the
clever
ones
one
of
the
masters
who
according
to
billy
were
responsible
for
all
the
cruelty
to
labor
for
the
hardships
of
the
women
for
the
punishment
of
the
labor
men
who
were
wearing
stripes
in
san
quentin
or
were
in
the
death
cells
awaiting
the
scaffold
yet
he
was
kind
sweet
natured
clean
good
she
could
read
his
character
in
his
face
but
how
could
this
be
if
he
were
responsible
for
so
much
evil
she
shook
her
head
wearily
there
was
no
explanation
no
understanding
of
this
world
which
destroyed
little
babes
and
bruised
women
breasts
as
for
her
having
strayed
into
that
neighborhood
of
fine
residences
she
was
unsurprised
it
was
in
line
with
her
queerness
she
did
so
many
things
without
knowing
that
she
did
them
but
she
must
be
careful
it
was
better
to
wander
on
the
marshes
and
the
rock
wall
especially
she
liked
the
rock
wall
there
was
a
freedom
about
it
a
wide
spaciousness
that
she
found
herself
instinctively
trying
to
breathe
holding
her
arms
out
to
embrace
and
make
part
of
herself
it
was
a
more
natural
world
a
more
rational
world
she
could
understand
it
understand
the
green
crabs
with
claws
that
scuttled
before
her
and
which
she
could
see
pasturing
on
rocks
when
the
tide
was
low
here
hopelessly
as
the
great
wall
was
nothing
seemed
artificial
there
were
no
men
here
no
laws
nor
conflicts
of
men
the
tide
flowed
and
ebbed
the
sun
rose
and
set
regularly
each
afternoon
the
brave
west
wind
came
romping
in
through
the
golden
gate
darkening
the
water
cresting
tiny
wavelets
making
the
sailboats
fly
everything
ran
with
frictionless
order
everything
was
free
firewood
lay
about
for
the
taking
no
man
sold
it
by
the
sack
small
boys
fished
with
poles
from
the
rocks
with
no
one
to
drive
them
away
for
trespass
catching
fish
as
billy
had
caught
fish
as
cal
hutchins
had
caught
fish
billy
had
told
her
of
the
great
perch
cal
hutchins
caught
on
the
day
of
the
eclipse
when
he
had
little
dreamed
the
heart
of
his
manhood
would
be
spent
in
convict
garb
and
here
was
food
food
that
was
free
she
watched
the
small
boys
on
a
day
when
she
had
eaten
nothing
and
emulated
them
gathering
mussels
from
the
rocks
at
low
water
cooking
them
by
placing
them
among
the
coals
of
a
fire
she
built
on
top
of
the
wall
they
tasted
particularly
good
she
learned
to
knock
the
small
oysters
from
the
rocks
and
once
she
found
a
string
of
fish
some
small
boy
had
forgotten
to
take
home
with
him
here
drifted
evidences
of
man
sinister
handiwork
from
a
distance
from
the
cities
one
flood
tide
she
found
the
water
covered
with
muskmelons
they
bobbed
and
bumped
along
up
the
estuary
in
countless
thousands
where
they
stranded
against
the
rocks
she
was
able
to
get
them
but
each
and
every
melon
and
she
patiently
tried
scores
of
them
had
been
spoiled
by
a
sharp
gash
that
let
in
the
salt
water
she
could
not
understand
she
asked
an
old
portuguese
woman
gathering
driftwood
they
do
it
the
people
who
have
too
much
the
old
woman
explained
straightening
her
back
with
such
an
effort
that
almost
saxon
could
hear
it
creak
the
old
woman
black
eyes
flashed
angrily
and
her
wrinkled
lips
drawn
tightly
across
toothless
gums
wry
with
bitterness
the
people
that
have
too
much
it
is
to
keep
up
the
price
they
throw
them
overboard
in
san
but
why
do
they
give
them
away
to
the
poor
people
saxon
asked
they
must
keep
up
the
but
the
poor
people
can
not
buy
them
anyway
saxon
objected
it
would
not
hurt
the
the
old
woman
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
not
know
it
is
their
way
they
chop
each
melon
so
that
the
poor
people
can
not
fish
them
out
and
eat
anyway
they
do
the
same
with
the
oranges
with
the
apples
ah
the
fishermen
there
is
a
trust
when
the
boats
catch
too
much
fish
the
trust
throws
them
overboard
from
fisherman
wharf
and
and
boatloads
of
the
beautiful
fish
and
the
beautiful
good
fish
sink
and
are
gone
and
no
one
gets
them
yet
they
are
dead
and
only
good
to
eat
fish
are
very
good
to
and
saxon
could
not
understand
a
world
that
did
such
things
a
world
in
which
some
men
possessed
so
much
food
that
they
threw
it
away
paying
men
for
their
labor
of
spoiling
it
before
they
threw
it
away
and
in
the
same
world
so
many
people
who
did
not
have
enough
food
whose
babies
died
because
their
mothers
milk
was
not
nourishing
whose
young
men
fought
and
killed
one
another
for
the
chance
to
work
whose
old
men
and
women
went
to
the
poorhouse
because
there
was
no
food
for
them
in
the
little
shacks
they
wept
at
leaving
she
wondered
if
all
the
world
were
that
way
and
remembered
mercedes
tales
yes
all
the
world
was
that
way
had
not
mercedes
seen
ten
thousand
families
starve
to
death
in
that
far
away
india
when
as
she
had
said
her
own
jewels
that
she
wore
would
have
fed
and
saved
them
all
it
was
the
poorhouse
and
the
salt
vats
for
the
stupid
jewels
and
automobiles
for
the
clever
ones
she
was
one
of
the
stupid
she
must
be
the
evidence
all
pointed
that
way
yet
saxon
refused
to
accept
it
she
was
not
stupid
her
mother
had
not
been
stupid
nor
had
the
pioneer
stock
before
her
still
it
must
be
so
here
she
sat
nothing
to
eat
at
home
her
changed
to
a
brute
beast
and
lying
in
jail
her
arms
and
heart
empty
of
the
babe
that
would
have
been
there
if
only
the
stupid
ones
had
not
made
a
shambles
of
her
front
yard
in
their
wrangling
over
jobs
she
sat
there
racking
her
brain
the
smudge
of
oakland
at
her
back
staring
across
the
bay
at
the
smudge
of
san
francisco
yet
the
sun
was
good
the
wind
was
good
as
was
the
keen
salt
air
in
her
nostrils
the
blue
sky
flecked
with
clouds
was
good
all
the
natural
world
was
right
and
sensible
and
beneficent
it
was
the
that
was
wrong
and
mad
and
horrible
why
were
the
stupid
stupid
was
it
a
law
of
god
no
it
could
not
be
god
had
made
the
wind
and
air
and
sun
the
was
made
by
man
and
a
rotten
job
it
was
yet
and
she
remembered
it
well
the
teaching
in
the
orphan
asylum
god
had
made
everything
her
mother
too
had
believed
this
had
believed
in
this
god
things
could
not
be
different
it
was
ordained
for
a
time
saxon
sat
crushed
helpless
then
smoldered
protest
revolt
vainly
she
asked
why
god
had
it
in
for
her
what
had
she
done
to
deserve
such
fate
she
briefly
reviewed
her
life
in
quest
of
deadly
sins
committed
and
found
them
not
she
had
obeyed
her
mother
obeyed
cady
the
and
cady
wife
obeyed
the
matron
and
the
other
women
in
the
orphan
asylum
obeyed
tom
when
she
came
to
live
in
his
house
and
never
run
in
the
streets
because
he
did
wish
her
to
at
school
she
had
always
been
honorably
promoted
and
never
had
her
deportment
report
varied
from
one
hundred
per
cent
she
had
worked
from
the
day
she
left
school
to
the
day
of
her
marriage
she
had
been
a
good
worker
too
the
little
jew
who
ran
the
paper
box
factory
had
almost
wept
when
she
quit
it
was
the
same
at
the
cannery
she
was
among
the
weavers
when
the
jute
mills
closed
down
and
she
had
kept
straight
it
was
not
as
if
she
had
been
ugly
or
unattractive
she
had
known
her
temptations
and
encountered
her
dangers
the
fellows
had
been
crazy
about
her
they
had
run
after
her
fought
over
her
in
a
way
to
turn
most
girls
heads
but
she
had
kept
straight
and
then
had
come
billy
her
reward
she
had
devoted
herself
to
him
to
his
house
to
all
that
would
nourish
his
love
and
now
she
and
billy
were
sinking
down
into
this
senseless
vortex
of
misery
and
heartbreak
of
the
world
no
god
was
not
responsible
she
could
have
made
a
better
world
herself
a
finer
squarer
world
this
being
so
then
there
was
no
god
god
could
not
make
a
botch
the
matron
had
been
wrong
her
mother
had
been
wrong
then
there
was
no
immortality
and
bert
wild
and
crazy
bert
falling
at
her
front
gate
with
his
foolish
was
right
one
was
a
long
time
dead
looking
thus
at
life
shorn
of
its
superrational
sanctions
saxon
floundered
into
the
morass
of
pessimism
there
was
no
justification
for
right
conduct
in
the
universe
no
square
deal
for
her
who
had
earned
reward
for
the
millions
who
worked
like
animals
died
like
animals
and
were
a
long
time
and
forever
dead
like
the
hosts
of
more
learned
thinkers
before
her
she
concluded
that
the
universe
was
unmoral
and
without
concern
for
men
and
now
she
sat
crushed
in
greater
helplessness
than
when
she
had
included
god
in
the
scheme
of
injustice
as
long
as
god
was
there
was
always
chance
for
a
miracle
for
some
supernatural
intervention
some
rewarding
with
ineffable
bliss
with
god
missing
the
world
was
a
trap
life
was
a
trap
she
was
like
a
linnet
caught
by
small
boys
and
imprisoned
in
a
cage
that
was
because
the
linnet
was
stupid
but
she
rebelled
she
fluttered
and
beat
her
soul
against
the
hard
face
of
things
as
did
the
linnet
against
the
bars
of
wire
she
was
not
stupid
she
did
not
belong
in
the
trap
she
would
fight
her
way
out
of
the
trap
there
must
be
such
a
way
out
when
canal
boys
and
the
lowliest
of
the
stupid
lowly
as
she
had
read
in
her
school
history
could
find
their
way
out
and
become
presidents
of
the
nation
and
rule
over
even
the
clever
ones
in
their
automobiles
then
could
she
find
her
way
out
and
win
to
the
tiny
reward
she
craved
billy
a
little
love
a
little
happiness
she
would
not
mind
that
the
universe
was
unmoral
that
there
was
no
god
no
immortality
she
was
willing
to
go
into
the
black
grave
and
remain
in
its
blackness
forever
to
go
into
the
salt
vats
and
let
the
young
men
cut
her
dead
flesh
to
if
if
only
she
could
get
her
small
meed
of
happiness
first
how
she
would
work
for
that
happiness
how
she
would
appreciate
it
make
the
most
of
each
least
particle
of
it
but
how
was
she
to
do
it
where
was
the
path
she
could
not
vision
it
her
eyes
showed
her
only
the
smudge
of
san
francisco
the
smudge
of
oakland
where
men
were
breaking
heads
and
killing
one
another
where
babies
were
dying
born
and
unborn
and
where
women
were
weeping
with
bruised
breasts
chapter
xvi
her
vague
unreal
existence
continued
it
seemed
in
some
previous
that
billy
had
gone
away
that
another
would
have
to
come
before
he
returned
she
still
suffered
from
insomnia
long
nights
passed
in
succession
during
which
she
never
closed
her
eyes
at
other
times
she
slept
through
long
stupors
waking
stunned
and
numbed
scarcely
able
to
open
her
heavy
eyes
to
move
her
weary
limbs
the
pressure
of
the
iron
band
on
her
head
never
relaxed
she
was
poorly
nourished
nor
had
she
a
cent
of
money
she
often
went
a
whole
day
without
eating
once
hours
elapsed
without
food
passing
her
lips
she
dug
clams
in
the
marsh
knocked
the
tiny
oysters
from
the
rocks
and
gathered
mussels
and
yet
when
bud
strothers
came
to
see
how
she
was
getting
along
she
convinced
him
that
all
was
well
one
evening
after
work
tom
came
and
forced
two
dollars
upon
her
he
was
terribly
worried
he
would
like
to
help
more
but
sarah
was
expecting
another
baby
there
had
been
slack
times
in
his
trade
because
of
the
strikes
in
the
other
trades
he
did
not
know
what
the
country
was
coming
to
and
it
was
all
so
simple
all
they
had
to
do
was
see
things
in
his
way
and
vote
the
way
he
voted
then
everybody
would
get
a
square
deal
christ
was
a
socialist
he
told
her
christ
died
two
thousand
years
ago
saxon
said
well
tom
queried
not
catching
her
implication
think
she
said
think
of
all
the
men
and
women
who
died
in
those
two
thousand
years
and
socialism
has
not
come
yet
and
in
two
thousand
years
more
it
may
be
as
far
away
as
ever
tom
your
socialism
never
did
you
any
good
it
is
a
it
would
be
if
he
began
with
a
flash
of
resentment
if
they
believed
as
you
do
only
they
do
you
do
succeed
in
making
but
we
are
increasing
every
year
he
argued
two
thousand
years
is
an
awfully
long
time
she
said
quietly
her
brother
tired
face
saddened
as
he
noted
then
he
sighed
well
saxon
if
it
a
dream
it
is
a
good
i
do
want
to
dream
was
her
reply
i
want
things
real
i
want
them
and
before
her
fancy
passed
the
countless
generations
of
the
stupid
lowly
the
billys
and
saxons
the
berts
and
marys
the
toms
and
sarahs
and
to
what
end
the
salt
vats
and
the
grave
mercedes
was
a
hard
and
wicked
woman
but
mercedes
was
right
the
stupid
must
always
be
under
the
heels
of
the
clever
ones
only
she
saxon
daughter
of
daisy
who
had
written
wonderful
poems
and
of
a
on
a
roan
daughter
of
the
strong
generations
who
had
won
half
a
world
from
wild
nature
and
the
savage
indian
no
she
was
not
stupid
it
was
as
if
she
suffered
false
imprisonment
there
was
some
mistake
she
would
find
the
way
out
with
the
two
dollars
she
bought
a
sack
of
flour
and
half
a
sack
of
potatoes
this
relieved
the
monotony
of
her
clams
and
mussels
like
the
italian
and
portuguese
women
she
gathered
driftwood
and
carried
it
home
though
always
she
did
it
with
shamed
pride
timing
her
arrival
so
that
it
would
be
after
dark
one
day
on
the
side
of
the
rock
wall
an
italian
fishing
boat
hauled
up
on
the
sand
dredged
from
the
channel
from
the
top
of
the
wall
saxon
watched
the
men
grouped
about
the
charcoal
brazier
eating
crusty
italian
bread
and
a
stew
of
meat
and
vegetables
washed
down
with
long
draughts
of
thin
red
wine
she
envied
them
their
freedom
that
advertised
itself
in
the
heartiness
of
their
meal
in
the
tones
of
their
chatter
and
laughter
in
the
very
boat
itself
that
was
not
tied
always
to
one
place
and
that
carried
them
wherever
they
willed
afterward
they
dragged
a
seine
across
the
and
up
on
the
sand
selecting
for
themselves
only
the
larger
kinds
of
fish
many
thousands
of
small
fish
like
sardines
they
left
dying
on
the
sand
when
they
sailed
away
saxon
got
a
sackful
of
the
fish
and
was
compelled
to
make
two
trips
in
order
to
carry
them
home
where
she
salted
them
down
in
a
wooden
washtub
her
lapses
of
consciousness
continued
the
strangest
thing
she
did
while
in
such
condition
was
on
sandy
beach
there
she
discovered
herself
one
windy
afternoon
lying
in
a
hole
she
had
dug
with
sacks
for
blankets
she
had
even
roofed
the
hole
in
rough
fashion
by
means
of
drift
wood
and
marsh
grass
on
top
of
the
grass
she
had
piled
sand
another
time
she
came
to
herself
walking
across
the
marshes
a
bundle
of
driftwood
tied
with
on
her
shoulder
charley
long
was
walking
beside
her
she
could
see
his
face
in
the
starlight
she
wondered
dully
how
long
he
had
been
talking
what
he
had
said
then
she
was
curious
to
hear
what
he
was
saying
she
was
not
afraid
despite
his
strength
his
wicked
nature
and
the
loneliness
and
darkness
of
the
marsh
it
a
shame
for
a
girl
like
you
to
have
to
do
this
he
was
saying
apparently
in
repetition
of
what
he
had
already
urged
come
on
an
say
the
word
saxon
come
on
an
say
the
saxon
stopped
and
quietly
faced
him
listen
charley
long
billy
only
doing
thirty
days
and
his
time
is
almost
up
when
he
gets
out
your
life
wo
be
worth
a
pinch
of
salt
if
i
tell
him
you
been
bothering
me
now
listen
if
you
go
right
now
away
from
here
and
stay
away
i
wo
tell
him
that
all
i
got
to
the
big
blacksmith
stood
in
scowling
indecision
his
face
pathetic
in
its
fierce
yearning
his
hands
making
unconscious
clutching
contractions
why
you
little
small
thing
he
said
desperately
i
could
break
you
in
one
hand
i
could
why
i
could
do
anything
i
wanted
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
saxon
you
know
that
just
say
the
word
i
said
the
only
word
i
going
to
god
he
muttered
in
involuntary
admiration
you
ai
afraid
you
ai
they
faced
each
other
for
long
silent
minutes
why
ai
you
afraid
he
demanded
at
last
after
peering
into
the
surrounding
darkness
as
if
searching
for
her
hidden
allies
because
i
married
a
man
saxon
said
briefly
and
now
you
better
when
he
had
gone
she
shifted
the
load
of
wood
to
her
other
shoulder
and
started
on
in
her
breast
a
quiet
thrill
of
pride
in
billy
though
behind
prison
bars
still
she
leaned
against
his
strength
the
mere
naming
of
him
was
sufficient
to
drive
away
a
brute
like
charley
long
on
the
day
that
otto
frank
was
hanged
she
remained
indoors
the
evening
papers
published
the
account
there
had
been
no
reprieve
in
sacramento
was
a
railroad
governor
who
might
reprieve
or
even
pardon
and
grafters
but
who
dared
not
lift
his
finger
for
a
workingman
all
this
was
the
talk
of
the
neighborhood
it
had
been
billy
talk
it
had
been
bert
talk
the
next
day
saxon
started
out
the
rock
wall
and
the
specter
of
otto
frank
walked
by
her
side
and
with
him
was
a
dimmer
mistier
specter
that
she
recognized
as
billy
was
he
too
destined
to
tread
his
way
to
otto
frank
dark
end
surely
so
if
the
blood
and
strike
continued
he
was
a
fighter
he
felt
he
was
right
in
fighting
it
was
easy
to
kill
a
man
even
if
he
did
not
intend
it
some
time
when
he
was
slugging
a
scab
the
scab
would
fracture
his
skull
on
a
stone
curbing
or
a
cement
sidewalk
and
then
billy
would
hang
that
was
why
otto
frank
hanged
he
had
not
intended
to
kill
henderson
it
was
only
by
accident
that
henderson
skull
was
fractured
yet
otto
frank
had
been
hanged
for
it
just
the
same
she
wrung
her
hands
and
wept
loudly
as
she
stumbled
among
the
windy
rocks
the
hours
passed
and
she
was
lost
to
herself
and
her
grief
when
she
came
to
she
found
herself
on
the
far
end
of
the
wall
where
it
jutted
into
the
bay
between
the
oakland
and
alameda
moles
but
she
could
see
no
wall
it
was
the
time
of
the
full
moon
and
the
unusual
high
tide
covered
the
rocks
she
was
knee
deep
in
the
water
and
about
her
knees
swam
scores
of
big
rock
rats
squeaking
and
fighting
scrambling
to
climb
upon
her
out
of
the
flood
she
screamed
with
fright
and
horror
and
kicked
at
them
some
dived
and
swam
away
under
water
others
circled
about
her
warily
at
a
distance
and
one
big
fellow
laid
his
teeth
into
her
shoe
him
she
stepped
on
and
crushed
with
her
free
foot
by
this
time
though
still
trembling
she
was
able
coolly
to
consider
the
situation
she
waded
to
a
stout
stick
of
driftwood
a
few
feet
away
and
with
this
quickly
cleared
a
space
about
herself
a
grinning
small
boy
in
a
small
and
skiff
sailed
close
in
to
the
wall
and
let
go
his
sheet
to
spill
the
wind
want
to
get
aboard
he
called
yes
she
answered
there
are
thousands
of
big
rats
here
i
afraid
of
he
nodded
ran
close
in
spilled
the
wind
from
his
sail
the
boat
way
carrying
it
gently
to
her
shove
out
its
bow
he
commanded
that
right
i
do
want
to
break
my
centerboard
an
then
jump
aboard
in
the
stern
quick
alongside
of
she
obeyed
stepping
in
lightly
beside
him
he
held
the
tiller
up
with
his
elbow
pulled
in
on
the
sheet
and
as
the
sail
filled
the
boat
sprang
away
over
the
rippling
water
you
know
boats
the
boy
said
approvingly
he
was
a
slender
almost
frail
lad
of
twelve
or
thirteen
years
though
healthy
enough
with
sunburned
freckled
face
and
large
gray
eyes
that
were
clear
and
wistful
despite
his
possession
of
the
pretty
boat
saxon
was
quick
to
sense
that
he
was
one
of
them
a
child
of
the
people
first
boat
i
was
ever
in
except
ferryboats
saxon
laughed
he
looked
at
her
keenly
well
you
take
to
it
like
a
duck
to
water
is
all
i
can
say
about
it
where
d
want
me
to
land
you
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
gave
her
another
long
look
considered
for
a
space
then
asked
suddenly
got
plenty
of
time
she
nodded
all
day
again
she
nodded
say
i
tell
you
i
goin
out
on
this
ebb
to
goat
island
for
rockcod
an
i
come
in
on
the
flood
this
evening
i
got
plenty
of
lines
an
bait
want
to
come
along
we
can
both
fish
and
what
you
catch
you
can
saxon
hesitated
the
freedom
and
motion
of
the
small
boat
appealed
to
her
like
the
ships
she
had
envied
it
was
outbound
maybe
you
drown
me
she
parleyed
the
boy
threw
back
his
head
with
pride
i
guess
i
been
sailin
many
a
long
day
by
myself
an
i
drowned
all
right
she
consented
though
remember
i
do
know
anything
about
aw
that
all
now
i
goin
to
go
about
when
i
say
like
that
you
duck
your
head
so
the
boom
do
hit
you
shift
over
to
the
other
he
executed
the
maneuver
saxon
obeyed
and
found
herself
sitting
beside
him
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
boat
while
the
boat
itself
on
the
other
tack
was
heading
toward
long
wharf
where
the
coal
bunkers
were
she
was
aglow
with
admiration
the
more
so
because
the
mechanics
of
was
to
her
a
complex
and
mysterious
thing
where
did
you
learn
it
all
she
inquired
taught
myself
just
naturally
taught
myself
i
liked
it
you
see
what
a
fellow

to
do
this
is
my
second
boat

first
did
have
a
centerboard
i
bought
it
for
two
dollars

learned
a
lot
though
it
never
stopped
leaking
what
d
think
i
paid
for
this
one
it
worth
dollars

what
d
think
i
paid
for
it

dollars

of
it

course

a
lot
of
work
an
the
sail
cost
two
dollars
the
oars
one
forty
an
the
paint
one
but
just
the
same
eleven
dollars
and
fifteen
cents
is
a
real
bargain
it
took
me
a
long
time
saving
for
it
though
i
carry
papers
morning
and
evening
there
a
boy
taking
my
route
for
me
this
afternoon
i

a
court
reporter
they

sometimes
as
much
as
twenty
dollars
a
day
gee
but
i
do
want
it
it
a
shame
to
waste
the
money
on
the
what
do
you
want
she
asked
partly
from
idleness
and
yet
with
genuine
curiosity
for
she
felt
drawn
to
this
boy
in
knee
pants
who
was
so
confident
and
at
the
same
time
so
wistful
what
do
i
want
he
repeated
after
her
turning
his
head
slowly
he
followed
the
pausing
especially
when
his
eyes
rested
landward
on
the
brown
contra
costa
hills
and
seaward
past
alcatraz
on
the
golden
gate
the
wistfulness
in
his
eyes
was
overwhelming
and
went
to
her
heart
that
he
said
sweeping
the
circle
of
the
world
with
a
wave
of
his
arm
that
she
queried
he
looked
at
her
perplexed
in
that
he
had
not
made
his
meaning
clear
do
you
ever
feel
that
way
he
asked
bidding
for
sympathy
with
his
dream
do
you
sometimes
feel
you
die
if
you
did
know
beyond
them
hills
an
what
beyond
the
other
hills
behind
them
hills
an
the
golden
gate
there
the
pacific
ocean
beyond
and
china
japan
an
india
an
an
all
the
coral
islands
you
can
go
anywhere
out
through
the
golden
gate
to
australia
to
africa
to
the
seal
islands
to
the
north
pole
to
cape
horn
why
all
them
places
are
just
waitin
for
me
to
come
an
see
i
lived
in
oakland
all
my
life
but
i
not
going
to
live
in
oakland
the
rest
of
my
life
not
by
a
long
shot
i
goin
to
get
away
away
again
as
words
failed
to
express
the
vastness
of
his
desire
the
wave
of
his
arm
swept
the
circle
of
the
world
saxon
thrilled
with
him
she
too
save
for
her
earlier
childhood
had
lived
in
oakland
all
her
life
and
it
had
been
a
good
place
in
which
to
live
until
now
and
now
in
all
its
nightmare
horror
it
was
a
place
to
get
away
from
as
with
her
people
the
east
had
been
a
place
to
get
away
from
and
why
not
the
world
tugged
at
her
and
she
felt
in
touch
with
the
lad
desire
now
that
she
thought
of
it
her
race
had
never
been
given
to
staying
long
in
one
place
always
it
had
been
on
the
move
she
remembered
back
to
her
mother
tales
and
to
the
wood
engraving
in
her
scrapbook
where
her
forebears
sword
in
hand
leaped
from
their
lean
beaked
boats
to
do
battle
on
the
sands
of
england
did
you
ever
hear
about
the
she
asked
the
boy
you
bet
his
eyes
glistened
and
he
looked
at
her
with
new
interest
i
an
every
inch
of
me
look
at
the
color
of
my
eyes
my
skin
i
awful
white
where
i
ai
sunburned
an
my
hair
was
yellow
when
i
was
a
baby
my
mother
says
it
be
dark
brown
by
the
time
grown
up
worse
luck
just
the
same
i
i
am
of
a
fighting
race
we
ai
afraid
of
nothin
this
bay
think
i
afraid
of
it
he
looked
out
over
the
water
with
flashing
eye
of
scorn
why
i
crossed
it
when
it
was
howlin
an
when
the
scow
schooner
sailors
said
i
lied
an
that
i
did
huh
they
were
only
squareheads
why
we
licked
their
kind
thousands
of
years
ago
we
lick
everything
we
go
up
against
wandered
all
over
the
world
licking
the
world
on
the
sea
on
the
land
it
all
the
same
look
at
ivory
nelson
look
at
davy
crockett
look
at
paul
jones
look
at
clive
an
kitchener
an
fremont
an
kit
carson
an
all
of
saxon
nodded
while
he
continued
her
own
eyes
shining
and
it
came
to
her
what
a
glory
it
would
be
to
be
the
mother
of
a
like
this
her
body
ached
with
the
fancied
quickening
of
unborn
life
a
good
stock
a
good
stock
she
thought
to
herself
then
she
thought
of
herself
and
billy
healthy
shoots
of
that
same
stock
yet
condemned
to
childlessness
because
of
the
trap
of
the
manmade
world
and
the
curse
of
being
herded
with
the
stupid
ones
she
came
back
to
the
boy
my
father
was
a
soldier
in
the
civil
war
he
was
telling
her
a
scout
an
a
spy
the
rebels
were
going
to
hang
him
twice
for
a
spy
at
the
battle
of
wilson
creek
he
ran
half
a
mile
with
his
captain
wounded
on
his
back
he
got
a
bullet
in
his
leg
right
now
just
above
the
knee
it
been
there
all
these
years
he
let
me
feel
it
once
he
was
a
buffalo
hunter
and
a
trapper
before
the
war
he
was
sheriff
of
his
county
when
he
was
twenty
years
old
an
after
the
war
when
he
was
marshal
of
silver
city
he
cleaned
out
the
bad
men
an
he
been
in
almost
every
state
in
the
union
he
could
wrestle
any
man
at
the
railings
in
his
day
an
he
was
bully
of
the
raftsmen
of
the
susquehanna
when
he
was
only
a
youngster
his
father
killed
a
man
in
a
standup
fight
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
when
he
was
sixty
years
old
when
he
was
his
second
wife
had
twins
an
he
died
when
he
was
plowing
in
the
field
with
oxen
when
he
was
years
old
he
just
unyoked
the
oxen
an
sat
down
under
a
tree
an
died
there
sitting
up
an
my
father
just
like
him
he
pretty
old
now
but
he
afraid
of
nothing
he
a
regular
you
see
he
a
special
policeman
an
he
did
do
a
thing
to
the
strikers
in
some
of
the
fightin
he
had
his
face
all
cut
up
with
a
rock
but
he
broke
his
club
short
off
over
some
hoodlum
he
paused
breathlessly
and
looked
at
her
gee
he
said
i
hate
to
that
my
name
is
saxon
she
said
your
name
my
first
gee
he
cried
you
lucky
now
if
mine
had
been
only
erling
you
know
erling
the
bold
or
wolf
or
swen
or
jarl
what
is
it
she
asked
only
john
he
admitted
sadly
but
i
do
let
call
me
john

to
call
me
jack
i
scrapped
with
a
dozen
fellows
that
tried
to
call
me
john
or
johnnie
would
that
make
you
sick
johnnie
they
were
now
off
the
coal
bunkers
of
long
wharf
and
the
boy
put
the
skiff
about
heading
toward
san
francisco
they
were
well
out
in
the
open
bay
the
west
wind
had
strengthened
and
was
whitecapping
the
strong
ebb
tide
the
boat
drove
merrily
along
when
splashes
of
spray
flew
aboard
wetting
them
saxon
laughed
and
the
boy
surveyed
her
with
approval
they
passed
a
ferryboat
and
the
passengers
on
the
upper
deck
crowded
to
one
side
to
watch
them
in
the
swell
of
the
steamer
wake
the
skiff
shipped
of
water
saxon
picked
up
an
empty
can
and
looked
at
the
boy
that
right
he
said
go
ahead
an
bale
and
when
she
had
finished
we
fetch
goat
island
next
tack
right
there
off
the
torpedo
station
is
where
we
fish
in
fifty
feet
of
water
an
the
tide
runnin
to
beat
the
band
you
wringing
wet
ai
you
gee
like
your
name
you
a
saxon
all
right
are
you
married
saxon
nodded
and
the
boy
frowned
what
you
want
to
do
that
for
now
you
ca
wander
over
the
world
like
i
going
to
you
tied
down
you
anchored
for
it
pretty
good
to
be
married
though
she
smiled
sure
everybody
gets
married
but
that
no
reason
to
be
in
a
rush
about
it
why
could
you
wait
a
while
like
me
i
goin
to
get
married
too
but
not
until
i
an
old
man
an
have
been
under
the
lee
of
goat
island
saxon
obediently
sitting
still
he
took
in
the
sail
and
when
the
boat
had
drifted
to
a
position
to
suit
him
he
dropped
a
tiny
anchor
he
got
out
the
fish
lines
and
showed
saxon
how
to
bait
her
hooks
with
salted
minnows
then
they
dropped
the
lines
to
bottom
where
they
vibrated
in
the
swift
tide
and
waited
for
bites
they
bite
pretty
soon
he
encouraged
i
never
failed
but
twice
to
catch
a
mess
here
what
d
say
we
eat
while
we
waiting
vainly
she
protested
she
was
not
hungry
he
shared
his
lunch
with
her
with
a
boy
rigid
equity
even
to
the
half
of
a
egg
and
the
half
of
a
big
red
apple
still
the
rockcod
did
not
bite
from
under
the
he
drew
out
a
book
free
library
he
vouchsafed
as
he
began
to
read
with
one
hand
holding
the
place
while
with
the
other
he
waited
for
the
tug
on
the
fishline
that
would
announce
rockcod
saxon
read
the
title
it
was
afloat
in
the
listen
to
this
he
said
after
a
few
minutes
and
he
read
several
pages
descriptive
of
a
great
flooded
tropical
forest
being
navigated
by
boys
on
a
raft
think
of
that
he
concluded
that
the
amazon
river
in
flood
time
in
south
america
and
the
world
full
of
places
like
that
everywhere
most
likely
except
oakland
oakland
just
a
place
to
start
from
i
guess
now
that
adventure
i
want
to
tell
you
just
think
of
the
luck
of
them
boys
all
the
same
some
day
i
going
to
go
over
the
andes
to
the
headwaters
of
the
amazon
all
through
the
rubber
country
an
canoe
down
the
amazon
thousands
of
miles
to
its
mouth
where
it
that
wide
you
ca
see
one
bank
from
the
other
an
where
you
can
scoop
up
perfectly
fresh
water
out
of
the
ocean
a
hundred
miles
from
but
saxon
was
not
listening
one
pregnant
sentence
had
caught
her
fancy
oakland
just
a
place
to
start
from
she
had
never
viewed
the
city
in
that
light
she
had
accepted
it
as
a
place
to
live
in
as
an
end
in
itself
but
a
place
to
start
from
why
not
why
not
like
any
railroad
station
or
ferry
depot
certainly
as
things
were
going
oakland
was
not
a
place
to
stop
in
the
boy
was
right
it
was
a
place
to
start
from
but
to
go
where
here
she
was
halted
and
she
was
driven
from
the
train
of
thought
by
a
strong
pull
and
a
series
of
jerks
on
the
line
she
began
to
haul
in
hand
under
hand
rapidly
and
deftly
the
boy
encouraging
her
until
hooks
sinker
and
a
big
gasping
rockcod
tumbled
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
fish
was
free
of
the
hook
and
she
baited
afresh
and
dropped
the
line
over
the
boy
marked
his
place
and
closed
the
book
they
be
biting
soon
as
fast
as
we
can
haul
in
he
said
but
the
rush
of
fish
did
not
come
immediately
did
you
ever
read
captain
mayne
reid
he
asked
or
captain
marryatt
or
ballantyne
she
shook
her
head
and
you
an
he
cried
derisively
why
there
stacks
of
in
the
free
library
i
have
two
cards
my
mother
an
mine
i
draw
out
all
the
time
after
school
before
i
have
to
carry
my
papers
i
stick
the
books
inside
my
shirt
in
front
under
the
suspenders
that
holds
one
time
deliverin
papers
at
second
market
there
an
awful
tough
gang
of
kids
hang
out
there
i
got
into
a
fight
with
the
leader
he
hauled
off
to
knock
my
wind
out
an
he
landed
square
on
a
book
you
ought
to
seen
his
face
an
then
i
landed
on
him
an
then
his
whole
gang
was
goin
to
jump
on
me
only
a
couple
of
stepped
in
an
saw
fair
play
i
gave
the
books
to
who
won
saxon
asked
nobody
the
boy
confessed
reluctantly
i
think
i
was
lickin
him
but
the
molders
called
it
a
draw
because
the
policeman
on
the
beat
stopped
us
when
we
only
ben
fightin
half
an
hour
but
you
ought
to
seen
the
crowd
i
bet
there
was
five
hundred
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
began
hauling
in
his
line
saxon
too
was
hauling
in
and
in
the
next
couple
of
hours
they
caught
twenty
pounds
of
fish
between
them
that
night
long
after
dark
the
little
skiff
sailed
up
the
oakland
estuary
the
wind
was
fair
but
light
and
the
boat
moved
slowly
towing
a
long
pile
which
the
boy
had
picked
up
adrift
and
announced
as
worth
three
dollars
anywhere
for
the
wood
that
was
in
it
the
tide
flooded
smoothly
under
the
full
moon
and
saxon
recognized
the
points
they
passed
the
transit
slip
sandy
beach
the
shipyards
the
nail
works
market
street
wharf
the
boy
took
the
skiff
in
to
a
dilapidated
at
the
foot
of
castro
street
where
the
scow
schooners
laden
with
sand
and
gravel
lay
hauled
to
the
shore
in
a
long
row
he
insisted
upon
an
equal
division
of
the
fish
because
saxon
had
helped
catch
them
though
he
explained
at
length
the
ethics
of
flotsam
to
show
her
that
the
pile
was
wholly
his
at
seventh
and
poplar
they
separated
saxon
walking
on
alone
to
pine
street
with
her
load
of
fish
tired
though
she
was
from
the
long
day
she
had
a
strange
feeling
of
and
after
cleaning
the
fish
she
fell
asleep
wondering
when
good
times
came
again
if
she
could
persuade
billy
to
get
a
boat
and
go
out
with
her
on
sundays
as
she
had
gone
out
that
day
chapter
xvii
she
slept
all
night
without
stirring
without
dreaming
and
awoke
naturally
and
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
refreshed
she
felt
her
old
self
as
if
some
depressing
weight
had
been
lifted
or
a
shadow
had
been
swept
away
from
between
her
and
the
sun
her
head
was
clear
the
seeming
iron
band
that
had
pressed
it
so
hard
was
gone
she
was
cheerful
she
even
caught
herself
humming
aloud
as
she
divided
the
fish
into
messes
for
olsen
maggie
donahue
and
herself
she
enjoyed
her
gossip
with
each
of
them
and
returning
home
plunged
joyfully
into
the
task
of
putting
the
neglected
house
in
order
she
sang
as
she
worked
and
ever
as
she
sang
the
magic
words
of
the
boy
danced
and
sparkled
among
the
notes
oakland
is
just
a
place
to
start
from
everything
was
clear
as
print
her
and
billy
problem
was
as
simple
as
an
arithmetic
problem
at
school
to
carpet
a
room
so
many
feet
long
so
many
feet
wide
to
paper
a
room
so
many
feet
high
so
many
feet
around
she
had
been
sick
in
her
head
she
had
had
strange
lapses
she
had
been
irresponsible
very
well
all
this
had
been
because
of
her
troubles
troubles
in
which
she
had
had
no
hand
in
the
making
case
was
hers
precisely
he
had
behaved
strangely
because
he
had
been
irresponsible
and
all
their
troubles
were
the
troubles
of
the
trap
oakland
was
the
trap
oakland
was
a
good
place
to
start
from
she
reviewed
the
events
of
her
married
life
the
strikes
and
the
hard
times
had
caused
everything
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
strike
of
the
shopmen
and
the
fight
in
her
front
yard
she
would
not
have
lost
her
baby
if
billy
had
not
been
made
desperate
by
the
idleness
and
the
hopeless
fight
of
the
teamsters
he
would
not
have
taken
to
drinking
if
they
had
not
been
hard
up
they
would
not
have
taken
a
lodger
and
billy
would
not
be
in
jail
her
mind
was
made
up
the
city
was
no
place
for
her
and
billy
no
place
for
love
nor
for
babies
the
way
out
was
simple
they
would
leave
oakland
it
was
the
stupid
that
remained
and
bowed
their
heads
to
fate
but
she
and
billy
were
not
stupid
they
would
not
bow
their
heads
they
would
go
forth
and
face
where
she
did
not
know
but
that
would
come
the
world
was
large
beyond
the
encircling
hills
out
through
the
golden
gate
somewhere
they
would
find
what
they
desired
the
boy
had
been
wrong
in
one
thing
she
was
not
tied
to
oakland
even
if
she
was
married
the
world
was
free
to
her
and
billy
as
it
had
been
free
to
the
wandering
generations
before
them
it
was
only
the
stupid
who
had
been
left
behind
everywhere
in
the
race
wandering
the
strong
had
gone
on
well
she
and
billy
were
strong
they
would
go
on
over
the
brown
contra
costa
hills
or
out
through
the
golden
gate
the
day
before
billy
release
saxon
completed
her
meager
preparations
to
receive
him
she
was
without
money
and
except
for
her
resolve
not
to
offend
billy
in
that
way
again
she
would
have
borrowed
ferry
fare
from
maggie
donahue
and
journeyed
to
san
francisco
to
sell
some
of
her
personal
pretties
as
it
was
with
bread
and
potatoes
and
salted
sardines
in
the
house
she
went
out
at
the
afternoon
low
tide
and
dug
clams
for
a
chowder
also
she
gathered
a
load
of
driftwood
and
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
when
she
emerged
from
the
marsh
on
her
shoulder
a
bundle
of
wood
and
a
spade
in
her
free
hand
the
pail
of
clams
she
sought
the
darker
side
of
the
street
at
the
corner
and
hurried
across
the
zone
of
electric
light
to
avoid
detection
by
the
neighbors
but
a
woman
came
toward
her
looked
sharply
and
stopped
in
front
of
her
it
was
mary
my
god
saxon
she
exclaimed
is
it
as
bad
as
this
saxon
looked
at
her
old
friend
curiously
with
a
swift
glance
that
sketched
all
the
tragedy
mary
was
thinner
though
there
was
more
color
in
her
cheeks
color
of
which
saxon
had
her
doubts
mary
bright
eyes
were
handsomer
larger
too
large
too
feverish
bright
too
restless
she
was
well
dressed
too
well
dressed
and
she
was
suffering
from
nerves
she
turned
her
head
apprehensively
to
glance
into
the
darkness
behind
her
my
god
saxon
breathed
and
you
she
shut
her
lips
then
began
anew
come
along
to
the
house
she
said
if
you
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
me
mary
blurted
with
one
of
her
old
quick
angers
no
no
saxon
disclaimed
it
the
driftwood
and
the
clams
i
want
the
neighbors
to
know

billy
still
in
ai

read
about
it
in
the
papers
mary
went
on
hurriedly
looking
behind
her
i
was
in
stockton
when
it
she
turned
upon
saxon
almost
savagely
you
do
blame
me
do
you
i
just
could
go
back
to
work
after
bein
married
i
was
sick
of
work

anyway
but
if
you
only

how
i
hated
the
laundry
even
before
i
got
married
it
a
dirty
world
you
do
dream
saxon
honest
to
god
you
could
never
guess
a
hundredth
part
of
its
dirtiness
oh

wish
i

out
of
it

run
for

come
aw
get
a
move
on
ca
you
a
man
voice
interrupted
behind
her
the
speaker
had
partly
emerged
from
the
darkness
no
workingman
saxon
could
see
that
lower
in
the
world
scale
despite
his
good
clothes
than
any
workingman
i
comin
if
you
only
wait
a
second
mary
placated
and
by
her
answer
and
its
accents
saxon
knew
that
mary
was
afraid
of
this
man
who
prowled
on
the
rim
of
light
mary
turned
to
her
i
got
to
beat
it
good
bye
she
said
fumbling
in
the
palm
of
her
glove
she
caught
saxon
free
hand
and
saxon
felt
a
small
hot
coin
pressed
into
it
she
tried
to
resist
to
force
it
back
no
no
mary
pleaded
for
old
times
you
can
do
as
much
for
me
some
day
i
see
you
again
good
suddenly
sobbing
she
threw
her
arms
around
saxon
waist
crushing
the
feathers
of
her
hat
against
the
load
of
wood
as
she
pressed
her
face
against
saxon
breast
then
she
tore
herself
away
to
arm
length
passionate
quivering
and
stood
gazing
at
saxon
aw
get
a
hustle
get
a
hustle
came
from
the
darkness
the
peremptory
voice
of
the
man
oh
saxon
mary
sobbed
and
was
gone
in
the
house
the
lamp
lighted
saxon
looked
at
the
coin
it
was
a
piece
to
her
a
fortune
then
she
thought
of
mary
and
of
the
man
of
whom
she
was
afraid
saxon
registered
another
black
mark
against
oakland
mary
was
one
more
destroyed
they
lived
only
five
years
on
the
average
saxon
had
heard
somewhere
she
looked
at
the
coin
and
tossed
it
into
the
kitchen
sink
when
she
cleaned
the
clams
she
heard
the
coin
tinkle
down
the
vent
pipe
it
was
the
thought
of
billy
next
morning
that
led
saxon
to
go
under
the
sink
unscrew
the
cap
to
the
catchtrap
and
rescue
the
piece
prisoners
were
not
well
fed
she
had
been
told
and
the
thought
of
placing
clams
and
dry
bread
before
billy
after
thirty
days
of
prison
fare
was
too
appalling
for
her
to
contemplate
she
knew
how
he
liked
to
spread
his
butter
on
thick
how
he
liked
thick
rare
steak
fried
on
a
dry
hot
pan
and
how
he
liked
coffee
that
was
coffee
and
plenty
of
it
not
until
after
nine
did
billy
arrive
and
she
was
dressed
in
her
prettiest
house
gingham
to
meet
him
she
peeped
on
him
as
he
came
slowly
up
the
front
steps
and
she
would
have
run
out
to
him
except
for
a
group
of
neighborhood
children
who
were
staring
from
across
the
street
the
door
opened
before
him
as
his
hand
reached
for
the
knob
and
inside
he
closed
it
by
backing
against
it
for
his
arms
were
filled
with
saxon
no
he
had
not
had
breakfast
nor
did
he
want
any
now
that
he
had
her
he
had
only
stopped
for
a
shave
he
had
stood
the
barber
off
and
he
had
walked
all
the
way
from
the
city
hall
because
of
lack
of
the
nickel
carfare
but
he
like
a
bath
most
mighty
well
and
a
change
of
clothes
she
must
come
near
him
until
he
was
clean
when
all
this
was
accomplished
he
sat
in
the
kitchen
and
watched
her
cook
noting
the
driftwood
she
put
in
the
stove
and
asking
about
it
while
she
moved
about
she
told
how
she
had
gathered
the
wood
how
she
had
managed
to
live
and
not
be
beholden
to
the
union
and
by
the
time
they
were
seated
at
the
table
she
was
telling
him
about
her
meeting
with
mary
the
night
before
she
did
not
mention
the
five
dollars
billy
stopped
chewing
the
first
mouthful
of
steak
his
expression
frightened
her
he
spat
the
meat
out
on
his
plate
you
got
the
money
to
buy
the
meat
from
her
he
accused
slowly
you
had
no
money
no
more
tick
with
the
butcher
yet
here
meat
am
i
right
saxon
could
only
bend
her
head
the
terrifying
ageless
look
had
come
into
his
face
the
bleak
and
passionless
glaze
into
his
eyes
which
she
had
first
seen
on
the
day
at
weasel
park
when
he
had
fought
with
the
three
irishmen
what
else
did
you
buy
he
demanded
not
roughly
not
angrily
but
with
the
fearful
coldness
of
a
rage
that
words
could
not
express
to
her
surprise
she
had
grown
calm
what
did
it
matter
it
was
merely
what
one
must
expect
living
in
oakland
something
to
be
left
behind
when
oakland
was
a
thing
behind
a
place
started
from
the
coffee
she
answered
and
the
he
emptied
his
plate
of
meat
and
her
plate
into
the
frying
pan
likewise
the
roll
of
butter
and
the
slice
on
the
table
and
on
top
he
poured
the
contents
of
the
coffee
canister
all
this
he
carried
into
the
back
yard
and
dumped
in
the
garbage
can
the
coffee
pot
he
emptied
into
the
sink
how
much
of
the
money
you
got
left
he
next
wanted
to
know
saxon
had
already
gone
to
her
purse
and
taken
it
out
three
dollars
and
eighty
cents
she
counted
handing
it
to
him
i
paid
cents
for
the
he
ran
his
eye
over
the
money
counted
it
and
went
to
the
front
door
she
heard
the
door
open
and
close
and
knew
that
the
silver
had
been
flung
into
the
street
when
he
came
back
to
the
kitchen
saxon
was
already
serving
him
fried
potatoes
on
a
clean
plate
nothin
too
good
for
the
robertses
he
said
but
by
god
that
sort
of
truck
is
too
high
for
my
stomach
it
so
high
it
he
glanced
at
the
fried
potatoes
the
fresh
slice
of
dry
bread
and
the
glass
of
water
she
was
placing
by
his
plate
it
all
right
she
smiled
as
he
hesitated
there
nothing
left
that
he
shot
a
swift
glance
at
her
face
as
if
for
sarcasm
then
sighed
and
sat
down
almost
immediately
he
was
up
again
and
holding
out
his
arms
to
her
i
goin
to
eat
in
a
minute
but
i
want
to
talk
to

down
and

closely

she

on

idea

fire

what

yourself
in
for
she

head
stubbornly
what

to
stomach

ai
goin
to
stomach
let
her
first
she
commenced
no
more
slugging
of
his
mouth

but
he
checked
the
involuntary
protest
and
second
no

i

that
no

oakland
no
more
living
in
oakland
i
die
if
i

he
digested
this
slowly
where
he
asked
finally
anywhere
everywhere
smoke
a
cigarette
and
think
it
he
shook
his
head
and
studied
her
you
mean
that
he
asked
at
length
i
do
i
want
to
chuck
oakland
just
as
hard
as
you
wanted
to
chuck
the
beefsteak
the
coffee
and
the
she
could
see
him
brace
himself
she
could
feel
him
brace
his
very
body

anywheres
an
now
settled
just
tell
me
what
you
got
it
in
for
oakland
and
she
told
him
all
she
had
thought
out
marshaled
all
the
facts
in
her
indictment
of
oakland
omitting
nothing
not
even
her
last
visit
to
doctor
hentley
office
nor
billy
drinking
he
but
drew
her
closer
and
proclaimed
his
resolves
anew
the
time
passed
the
fried
potatoes
grew
cold
and
the
stove
went
out
when
a
pause
came
billy
stood
up
still
holding
her
he
glanced
at
the
fried
potatoes
stone
cold
he
said
then
turned
to
her
come

put

your
prettiest

to
be
several
gold
medals
won
in
his
amateur
days
at
boxing
tournaments
once
up
town
and
in
the
pawnshop
uncle
sam
seemed
thoroughly
versed
in
the
value
of
the
medals
and
billy
jingled
a
handful
of
silver
in
his
pocket
as
they
walked
out
he
was
as
hilarious
as
a
boy
and
she
joined
in
his
good
spirits
when
he
stopped
at
a
corner
cigar
store
to
buy
a
sack
of
bull
durham
he
changed
his
mind
and
bought
imperials
oh

good

no

the
restaurant

and
broadway
where

take

private

billy

knocking

just
travelers
through
this
yep
that
the
stuff
billy
muttered
absently
he
was
looking
at
the
theater
column
he
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
paper
matinee
at
bell
we
can
get
reserved
seats
for
a
doggone
the
luck
anyway
his
exclamation
was
so
aggrieved
and
violent
that
it
brought
alarm
into
her
eyes
if
i
only
thought
he
regretted
we
could
to
the
forum
for
grub
that
the
swell
joint
where
fellows
like
roy
blanchard
hangs
out
blowin
the
money
we
sweat
for
they
bought
reserved
tickets
at
bell
theater
but
it
was
too
early
for
the
performance
and
they
went
down
broadway
and
into
the
electric
theater
to
while
away
the
time
on
a
moving
picture
show
a
cowboy
film
was
run
off
and
a
french
comic
then
came
a
rural
drama
situated
somewhere
in
the
middle
west
it
began
with
a
farm
yard
scene
the
sun
blazed
down
on
a
corner
of
a
barn
and
on
a
rail
fence
where
the
ground
lay
in
the
mottled
shade
of
large
trees
overhead
there
were
chickens
ducks
and
turkeys
scratching
waddling
moving
about
a
big
sow
followed
by
a
litter
of
seven
little
ones
marched
majestically
through
the
chickens
rooting
them
out
of
the
way
the
hens
in
turn
took
it
out
on
the
little
porkers
pecking
them
when
they
strayed
too
far
from
their
mother
and
over
the
top
rail
a
horse
looked
drowsily
on
ever
and
anon
at
mathematically
precise
intervals
switching
a
lazy
tail
that
flashed
high
lights
in
the
sunshine
it
a
warm
day
and
there
are
flies
ca
you
just
feel
it
saxon
whispered
sure
an
that
horse
tail
it
the
most
natural
ever
gee
i
bet
he
knows
the
trick
of
clampin
it
down
over
the
reins
i
would
wonder
if
his
name
was
iron
a
dog
ran
upon
the
scene
the
mother
pig
turned
tail
and
with
short
ludicrous
jumps
followed
by
her
progeny
and
pursued
by
the
dog
fled
out
of
the
film
a
young
girl
came
on
a
sunbonnet
hanging
down
her
back
her
apron
caught
up
in
front
and
filled
with
grain
which
she
threw
to
the
fluttering
fowls
pigeons
flew
down
from
the
top
of
the
film
and
joined
in
the
scrambling
feast
the
dog
returned
wading
scarcely
noticed
among
the
feathered
creatures
to
wag
his
tail
and
laugh
up
at
the
girl
and
behind
the
horse
nodded
over
the
rail
and
switched
on
a
young
man
entered
his
errand
immediately
known
to
an
audience
educated
in
moving
pictures
but
saxon
had
no
eyes
for
the
the
pleading
forcefulness
the
shy
reluctance
of
man
and
maid
ever
her
gaze
wandered
back
to
the
chickens
to
the
mottled
shade
under
the
trees
to
the
warm
wall
of
the
barn
to
the
sleepy
horse
with
its
ever
recurrent
whisk
of
tail
she
drew
closer
to
billy
and
her
hand
passed
around
his
arm
sought
his
hand
oh
billy
she
sighed
i
just
die
of
happiness
in
a
place
like
and
when
the
film
was
ended
we
got
lots
of
time
for
bell
let
stay
and
see
that
one
over
they
sat
through
a
repetition
of
the
performance
and
when
the
farm
yard
scene
appeared
the
longer
saxon
looked
at
it
the
more
it
affected
her
and
this
time
she
took
in
further
details
she
saw
fields
beyond
rolling
hills
in
the
background
and
a
sky
she
identified
some
of
the
chickens
especially
an
obstreperous
old
hen
who
resented
the
thrust
of
the
sow
muzzle
particularly
pecked
at
the
little
pigs
and
laid
about
her
with
a
vengeance
when
the
grain
fell
saxon
looked
back
across
the
fields
to
the
hills
and
sky
breathing
the
spaciousness
of
it
the
freedom
the
content
tears
welled
into
her
eyes
and
she
wept
silently
happily
i
know
a
trick
that
fix
that
old
horse
if
he
ever
clamped
his
tail
down
on
me
billy
whispered
now
i
know
where
we
going
when
we
leave
oakland
she
informed
him
where
he
looked
at
her
and
followed
her
gaze
to
the
screen
oh
he
said
and
cogitated
an
why
should
we
he
added
oh
billy
will
you
her
lips
trembled
in
her
eagerness
and
her
whisper
broke
and
was
almost
inaudible
sure
he
said
it
was
his
day
of
royal
largess
what
you
want
is
yourn
an
i
scratch
my
fingers
off
for
it
i
always
had
a
hankerin
for
the
country
myself
say
i
known
horses
like
that
to
sell
for
half
the
price
an
i
can
sure
cure
of
the
chapter
xviii
it
was
early
evening
when
they
got
off
the
car
at
seventh
and
pine
on
their
way
home
from
bell
theater
billy
and
saxon
did
their
little
marketing
together
then
separated
at
the
corner
saxon
to
go
on
to
the
house
and
prepare
supper
billy
to
go
and
see
the
boys
the
teamsters
who
had
fought
on
in
the
strike
during
his
month
of
retirement
take
care
of
yourself
billy
she
called
as
he
started
off
sure
he
answered
turning
his
face
to
her
over
his
shoulder
her
heart
leaped
at
the
smile
it
was
his
old
unsullied
which
she
wanted
always
to
see
on
his
face
for
which
armed
with
her
own
wisdom
and
the
wisdom
of
mercedes
she
would
wage
the
utmost
war
to
possess
a
thought
of
this
flashed
brightly
through
her
brain
and
it
was
with
a
proud
little
smile
that
she
remembered
all
her
pretty
equipment
stored
at
home
in
the
bureau
and
the
chest
of
drawers
of
an
hour
later
supper
ready
all
but
the
putting
on
of
the
lamb
chops
at
the
sound
of
his
step
saxon
waited
she
heard
the
gate
click
but
instead
of
his
step
she
heard
a
curious
and
confused
scraping
of
many
steps
she
flew
to
open
the
door
billy
stood
there
but
a
different
billy
from
the
one
she
had
parted
from
so
short
a
time
before
a
small
boy
beside
him
held
his
hat
his
face
had
been
or
rather
drenched
for
his
shirt
and
shoulders
were
wet
his
pale
hair
lay
damp
and
plastered
against
his
forehead
and
was
darkened
by
oozing
blood
both
arms
hung
limply
by
his
side
but
his
face
was
composed
and
he
even
grinned
it
all
right
he
reassured
saxon
the
joke
on
me
somewhat
damaged
but
still
in
the
he
stepped
gingerly
across
the
threshold
come
on
in
you
fellows
we
all
mutts
he
was
followed
in
by
the
boy
with
his
hat
by
bud
strothers
and
another
teamster
she
knew
and
by
two
strangers
the
latter
were
big
men
who
stared
at
saxon
as
if
afraid
of
her
it
all
right
saxon
billy
began
but
was
interrupted
by
bud
first
thing
is
to
get
him
on
the
bed
an
cut
his
clothes
off
him
both
arms
is
broke
and
here
are
the
ginks
that
done
he
indicated
the
two
strangers
who
shuffled
their
feet
with
embarrassment
and
looked
more
sheepish
than
ever
billy
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
while
saxon
held
the
lamp
bud
and
the
strangers
proceeded
to
cut
coat
shirt
and
undershirt
from
him
he
would
go
to
the
receivin
hospital
bud
said
to
saxon

saxon
demanded
looking
from
billy
to
the
two
strangers
puzzled
by
the
amity
that
so
evidently
existed
among
them
all
oh
they
all
right
billy
dashed
in
they
done
it
through
mistake
they
frisco
teamsters
an
they
come
over
to
help
us
a
lot
of
the
two
teamsters

to
cheer
up
at
this
and
nodded
their
heads
yes
missus
one
of
them
rumbled
hoarsely
it
all
a
mistake
an
well
the
joke
on
the
drinks
anyway
billy
grinned
not
only
was
saxon
not
excited
but
she
was
scarcely
perturbed
what
had
happened
was
only
to
be
expected
it
was
in
line
with
all
that
oakland
had
already
done
to
her
and
hers
and
besides
billy
was
not
dangerously
hurt
broken
arms
and
a
sore
head
would
heal
she
brought
chairs
and
seated
everybody
now

what
asked
saxon
the
man
pointed
to
the
wound
in
billy
scalp
i
laid
out
he
went
down
like
a
steer
an
got
up
on
his
knees
dippy
about
somebody
standin
on
their
foot
he
did
know
where
he
was
at
you
see
clean
groggy
an
then
we
done
the
man
paused
the
tale
told
broke
both
his
arms
with
the
crowbar
bud
supplemented
that
when
i
come
to
myself
when
the
bones
broke
billy
corroborated
an
there
was
the
two
of
givin
me
the
last
you
some
time
jackson
was
sayin
an
anson
says
like
to

an
then
jackson
says
give
something
for
luck
an
with
that
he
fetched
me
a
wallop
on
the
jaw
no
corrected
anson
that
wallop
was
well
it
sent
me
into
dreamland
over
again
billy
sighed
an
when
i
come
to
here
was
bud
an
anson
an
jackson
dousin
me
at
a
water
trough
an
then
we
dodged
a
reporter
an
all
come
home
bud
strothers
held
up
his
fist
and
indicated
freshly
abraded
skin
the
just
insisted
on
samplin
it
he
said
then
to
billy
that
why
i
cut
around
ninth
an
caught
up
with
you
down
on
a
few
minutes
later
doctor
hentley
arrived
and
drove
the
men
from
the
rooms
they
waited
till
he
had
finished
to
assure
themselves
of
well
being
and
then
departed
in
the
kitchen
doctor
hentley
washed
his
hands
and
gave
saxon
final
instructions
as
he
dried
himself
he
sniffed
the
air
and
looked
toward
the
stove
where
a
pot
was
simmering
clams
he
said
where
did
you
buy
them
i
did
buy
them
replied
saxon
i
dug
them
not
in
the
marsh
he
asked
with
quickened
interest
throw
them
away
throw
them
out
they
death
and
corruption
typhoid
i
got
three
cases
now
all
traced
to
the
clams
and
the
when
he
had
gone
saxon
obeyed
still
another
mark
against
oakland
she
reflected
oakland
the
that
poisoned
those
it
could
not
starve
if
it
would
drive
a
man
to
drink
billy
groaned
when
saxon
returned
to
him
did
you
ever
dream
such
luck
look
at
all
my
fights
in
the
ring
an
never
a
broken
bone
an
here
snap
snap
just
like
that
two
arms
oh
it
might
be
worse
saxon
smiled
cheerfully
i
like
to
know
how
it
might
have
been
your
an
a
good
job
i
tell
you
saxon
you
got
ta
show
me
anything
i
can
she
said
confidently
well
well
would
it
be
worse
if
you
intended
staying
on
in
oakland
where
it
might
happen
again
i
can
see
myself
becomin
a
farmer
an
plowin
with
a
pair
of
like
these
he
persisted
doctor
hentley
says
they
be
stronger
at
the
break
than
ever
before
and
you
know
yourself
that
true
of
bones
now
you
close
your
eyes
and
go
to
sleep
you
all
done
up
and
you
need
to
keep
your
brain
quiet
and
stop
he
closed
his
eyes
obediently
she
slipped
a
cool
hand
under
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
let
it
rest
that
feels
good
he
murmured
you
so
cool
saxon
your
hand
and
you
all
of
you
bein
with
you
is
like
comin
out
into
the
cool
night
after
dancin
in
a
hot
after
several
minutes
of
quiet
he
began
to
giggle
what
is
it
she
asked
oh
nothin
i
was
just
thinkin
thinking
of
them
mutts
doin
me
up
me
that
done
up
more
scabs
than
i
can
next
morning
billy
awoke
with
his
blues
dissipated
from
the
kitchen
saxon
heard
him
painfully
wrestling
strange
vocal
acrobatics
i
got
a
new
song
you
never
heard
he
told
her
when
she
came
in
with
a
cup
of
coffee
i
only
remember
the
chorus
though
it
the
old
man
talkin
to
some
hobo
of
a
hired
man
that
wants
to
marry
his
daughter
mamie
that
billy
murphy
used
to
run
with
before
he
got
married
used
to
sing
it
it
a
kind
of
a
sobby
song
it
used
to
always
give
mamie
the
weeps
here
the
way
the
chorus
goes
an
remember
it
the
old
man
and
with
great
solemnity
and
excruciating
flatting
billy
sang
o
treat
my
daughter
an
say
you
do
no
harm
an
when
i
die
i
will
to
you
my
little
house
an
farm
my
horse
my
plow
my
sheep
my
cow
an
all
them
little
chickens
in
the
it
them
little
chickens
in
the
garden
that
gets
me
he
explained
that
how
i
remembered
it
from
the
chickens
in
the
movin
pictures
yesterday
an
some
day
we
have
little
chickens
in
the
garden
we
old
girl
and
a
daughter
too
saxon
amplified
an
i
be
the
old
geezer
sayin
them
same
words
to
the
hired
man
billy
carried
the
fancy
along
it
do
take
long
to
raise
a
daughter
if
you
ai
in
a
saxon
took
her
ukulele
from
its
case
and
strummed
it
into
tune
and
i
a
song
you
never
heard
billy
tom
always
singing
it
crazy
about
taking
up
government
land
and
going
farming
only
sarah
wo
think
of
it
he
sings
it
something
like
this
we
have
a
little
farm
a
pig
a
horse
a
cow
and
you
will
drive
the
wagon
and
i
will
drive

only
in
this
case
i
guess
it
me
that
do
the
plowin
billy
approved
say
saxon
sing
days
that
a
farmer
song
after
that
she
feared
the
coffee
was
growing
cold
and
compelled
billy
to
take
it
in
the
helplessness
of
two
broken
arms
he
had
to
be
fed
like
a
baby
and
as
she
fed
him
they
talked
i
tell
you
one
thing
billy
said
between
mouthfuls
once
we
get
settled
down
in
the
country
you
have
that
horse
you
been
for
all
your
life
an
it
be
all
your
own
to
ride
drive

or
do
anything
you
want
and
again
he
ruminated
one
thing
that
come
handy
in
the
country
is
that
i
know
horses
that
a
big
start
i
can
always
get
a
job
at
that
if
it
ai
at
union
wages
an
the
other
things
about
farmin
i
can
learn
fast
say
d
remember
that
day
you
first
told
me
about
wantin
a
horse
to
ride
all
your
life
saxon
remembered
and
it
was
only
by
a
severe
struggle
that
she
was
able
to
keep
the
tears
from
welling
into
her
eyes
she
seemed
bursting
with
happiness
and
she
was
remembering
many
things
all
the
warm
promise
of
life
with
billy
that
had
been
hers
in
the
days
before
hard
times
and
now
the
promise
was
renewed
again
since
its
fulfillment
had
not
come
to
them
they
were
going
away
to
fulfill
it
for
themselves
and
make
the
moving
pictures
come
true
impelled
by
a
fear
she
stole
away
into
the
kitchen
bedroom
where
bert
had
died
to
study
her
face
in
the
bureau
mirror
no
she
decided
she
was
little
changed
she
was
still
equipped
for
the
battlefield
of
love
beautiful
she
was
not
she
knew
that
but
had
not
mercedes
said
that
the
great
women
of
history
who
had
won
men
had
not
been
beautiful
and
yet
saxon
insisted
as
she
gazed
at
her
reflection
she
was
anything
but
unlovely
she
studied
her
wide
gray
eyes
that
were
so
very
gray
that
were
always
alive
with
light
and
vivacities
where
in
the
surface
and
depths
always
swam
thoughts
unuttered
thoughts
that
sank
down
and
dissolved
to
give
place
to
other
thoughts
the
brows
were
excellent
she
realized
that
slenderly
penciled
a
little
darker
than
her
light
brown
hair
they
just
fitted
her
irregular
nose
that
was
feminine
but
not
weak
that
if
anything
was
piquant
and
that
picturesquely
might
be
declared
impudent
she
could
see
that
her
face
was
slightly
thin
that
the
red
of
her
lips
was
not
quite
so
red
and
that
she
had
lost
some
of
her
quick
coloring
but
all
that
would
come
back
again
her
mouth
was
not
of
the
rosebud
type
she
saw
in
the
magazines
she
paid
particular
attention
to
it
a
pleasant
mouth
it
was
a
mouth
to
be
joyous
with
a
mouth
for
laughter
and
to
make
laughter
in
others
she
deliberately
experimented
with
it
smiled
till
the
corners
dented
deeper
and
she
knew
that
when
she
smiled
her
smile
was
provocative
of
smiles
she
laughed
with
her
eyes
alone
a
trick
of
hers
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
with
eyes
and
mouth
together
between
her
spread
lips
showing
the
even
rows
of
strong
white
teeth
and
she
remembered
billy
praise
of
her
teeth
the
night
at
germanic
hall
after
he
had
told
charley
long
he
was
standing
on
his
foot
not
big
and
not
little
dinky
baby
teeth
either
billy
had
said
just
right
and
they
fit
also
he
had
said
that
to
look
at
them
made
him
hungry
and
that
they
were
good
enough
to
eat
she
recollected
all
the
compliments
he
had
ever
paid
her
beyond
all
treasures
these
were
treasures
to
her
the
love
phrases
praises
and
admirations
he
had
said
her
skin
was
cool
soft
as
velvet
too
and
smooth
as
silk
she
rolled
up
her
sleeve
to
the
shoulder
brushed
her
cheek
with
the
white
skin
for
a
test
with
deep
scrutiny
examined
the
fineness
of
its
texture
and
he
had
told
her
that
she
was
sweet
that
he
had
known
what
it
meant
when
they
said
a
girl
was
sweet
not
until
he
had
known
her
and
he
had
told
her
that
her
voice
was
cool
that
it
gave
him
the
feeling
her
hand
did
when
it
rested
on
his
forehead
her
voice
went
all
through
him
he
had
said
cool
and
fine
like
a
wind
of
coolness
and
he
had
likened
it
to
the
first
of
the
sea
breeze
setting
in
the
afternoon
after
a
scorching
hot
morning
and
also
when
she
talked
low
that
it
was
round
and
sweet
like
the
in
the
macdonough
theater
orchestra
he
had
called
her
his
tonic
kid
he
had
called
her
a
thoroughbred
and
spirited
all
fine
nerves
and
delicate
and
sensitive
he
had
liked
the
way
she
carried
her
clothes
she
carried
them
like
a
dream
had
been
his
way
of
putting
it
they
were
part
of
her
just
as
much
as
the
cool
of
her
voice
and
skin
and
the
scent
of
her
hair
and
her
figure
she
got
upon
a
chair
and
tilted
the
mirror
so
that
she
could
see
herself
from
hips
to
feet
she
drew
her
skirt
back
and
up
the
slender
ankle
was
just
as
slender
the
calf
had
lost
none
of
its
delicately
mature
swell
she
studied
her
hips
her
waist
her
bosom
her
neck
the
poise
of
her
head
and
sighed
contentedly
billy
must
be
right
and
he
had
said
that
she
was
built
like
a
french
woman
and
that
in
the
matter
of
lines
and
form
she
could
give
annette
kellerman
cards
and
spades
he
had
said
so
many
things
now
that
she
recalled
them
all
at
one
time
her
lips
the
sunday
he
proposed
he
had
said
i
like
to
watch
your
lips
talking
it
funny
but
every
move
they
make
looks
like
a
tickly
and
afterward
that
same
day
you
looked
good
to
me
from
the
first
moment
i
spotted
he
had
praised
her
housekeeping
he
had
said
he
fed
better
lived
more
comfortably
held
up
his
end
with
the
fellows
and
saved
money
and
she
remembered
that
day
when
he
had
crushed
her
in
his
arms
and
declared
she
was
the
greatest
little
bit
of
a
woman
that
had
ever
come
down
the
pike
she
ran
her
eyes
over
all
herself
in
the
mirror
again
gathered
herself
together
into
a
whole
compact
and
good
to
look
upon
delicious
she
knew
yes
she
would
do
magnificent
as
billy
was
in
his
man
way
in
her
own
way
she
was
a
match
for
him
yes
she
had
done
well
by
billy
she
deserved
much
all
he
could
give
her
the
best
he
could
give
her
but
she
made
no
blunder
of
egotism
frankly
valuing
herself
she
as
frankly
valued
him
when
he
was
himself
his
real
self
not
harassed
by
trouble
not
pinched
by
the
trap
not
maddened
by
drink
her
and
lover
he
was
well
worth
all
she
gave
him
or
could
give
him
saxon
gave
herself
a
farewell
look
no
she
was
not
dead
any
more
than
was
billy
love
dead
than
was
her
love
dead
all
that
was
needed
was
the
proper
soil
and
their
love
would
grow
and
blossom
and
they
were
turning
their
backs
upon
oakland
to
go
and
seek
that
proper
soil
oh
billy
she
called
through
the
partition
still
standing
on
the
chair
one
hand
tipping
the
mirror
forward
and
back
so
that
she
was
able
to
run
her
eyes
from
the
reflection
of
her
ankles
and
calves
to
her
face
warm
with
color
and
roguishly
alive
yes
she
heard
him
answer
i
loving
myself
she
called
back
what
the
game
came
his
puzzled
query
what
are
you
so
stuck
on
yourself
for
because
you
love
me
she
answered
i
love
every
bit
of
me
billy
because
because
well
because
you
love
every
bit
of
chapter
xix
between
feeding
and
caring
for
billy
doing
the
housework
making
plans
and
selling
her
store
of
pretty
needlework
the
days
flew
happily
for
saxon
billy
consent
to
sell
her
pretties
had
been
hard
to
get
but
at
last
she
succeeded
in
coaxing
it
out
of
him
it
only
the
ones
i
have
used
she
urged
and
i
can
always
make
more
when
we
get
settled
what
she
did
not
sell
along
with
the
household
linen
and
hers
and
billy
spare
clothing
she
arranged
to
store
with
tom
go
ahead
billy
said
this
is
your
picnic
what
you
say
goes
robinson
crusoe
an
i
your
man
friday
make
up
your
mind
yet
which
way
you
goin
to
travel
saxon
shook
her
head
or
how
she
held
up
one
foot
and
then
the
other
encased
in
stout
walking
shoes
which
she
had
begun
that
morning
to
break
in
about
the
house
mare
eh
it
the
way
our
people
came
into
the
west
she
said
proudly
it
be
regular
trampin
though
he
argued
an
i
never
heard
of
a
woman
then
here
one
why
billy
there
no
shame
in
tramping
my
mother
tramped
most
of
the
way
across
the
plains
and
everybody
mother
tramped
across
in
those
days
i
do
care
what
people
will
think
i
guess
our
race
has
been
on
the
tramp
since
the
beginning
of
creation
just
like
we
be
looking
for
a
piece
of
land
that
looked
good
to
settle
down
after
a
few
days
when
his
scalp
was
sufficiently
healed
and
the
was
nicely
in
process
billy
was
able
to
be
up
and
about
he
was
still
quite
helpless
however
with
both
his
arms
in
splints
doctor
hentley
not
only
agreed
but
himself
suggested
that
his
bill
should
wait
against
better
times
for
settlement
of
government
land
in
response
to
saxon
eager
questioning
he
knew
nothing
except
that
he
had
a
hazy
idea
that
the
days
of
government
land
were
over
tom
on
the
contrary
was
confident
that
there
was
plenty
of
government
land
he
talked
of
honey
lake
of
shasta
county
and
of
humboldt
but
you
ca
tackle
it
at
this
time
of
year
with
winter
comin
on
he
advised
saxon
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
head
south
for
warmer
weather
say
along
the
coast
it
do
snow
down
there
i
tell
you
what
you
do
go
down
by
san
jose
and
salinas
an
come
out
on
the
coast
at
monterey
south
of
that
you
find
government
land
mixed
up
with
forest
reserves
and
mexican
rancheros
it
pretty
wild
without
any
roads
to
speak
of
all
they
do
is
handle
cattle
but
there
some
fine
redwood
canyons
with
good
patches
of
farming
ground
that
run
right
down
to
the
ocean
i
was
talkin
last
year
with
a
fellow
that
been
all
through
there
an
i
like
you
an
billy
only
sarah
would
hear
of
it
there
gold
down
there
too
quite
a
bunch
is
in
there
prospectin
an
two
or
three
good
mines
have
opened
but
that
farther
along
and
in
a
ways
from
the
coast
you
might
take
a
saxon
shook
her
head
we
not
looking
for
gold
but
for
chickens
and
a
place
to
grow
vegetables
our
folks
had
all
the
chance
for
gold
in
the
early
days
and
what
have
they
got
to
show
for
it
i
guess
you
right
tom
conceded
they
always
played
too
big
a
game
an
missed
the
thousand
little
chances
right
under
their
nose
look
at
your
pa
i
heard
him
tell
of
selling
three
market
street
lots
in
san
francisco
for
fifty
dollars
each
they
worth
five
hundred
thousand
right
now
an
look
at
uncle
will
he
had
ranches
till
the
cows
come
home
satisfied
no
he
wanted
to
be
a
cattle
king
a
regular
miller
and
lux
an
when
he
died
he
was
a
night
watchman
in
los
angeles
at
forty
dollars
a
month
there
a
spirit
of
the
times
an
the
spirit
of
the
times
has
changed
it
all
big
business
now
an
we
the
small
potatoes
why
i
heard
our
folks
talk
of
livin
in
the
western
reserve
that
was
all
around
what
ohio
now
anybody
could
get
a
farm
them
days
all
they
had
to
do
was
yoke
their
oxen
an
go
after
it
the
pacific
ocean
thousands
of
miles
to
the
west
an
all
them
thousands
of
miles
an
millions
of
farms
just
waitin
to
be
took
up
a
hundred
sixty
acres
shucks
in
the
early
days
in
oregon
they
talked
six
hundred
an
forty
acres
that
was
the
spirit
of
them
times
free
land
plenty
of
it
but
when
we
reached
the
pacific
ocean
them
times
was
ended
big
business
begun
an
big
business
means
big
business
men
an
every
big
business
man
means
thousands
of
little
men
without
any
business
at
all
except
to
work
for
the
big
ones
they
the
losers
do
you
see
an
if
they
do
like
it
they
can
lump
it
but
it
do
them
no
good
they
ca
yoke
up
their
oxen
an
pull
on
there
no
place
to
pull
on
china
over
there
an
in
between
a
mighty
lot
of
salt
water
that
no
good
for
farmin
that
all
clear
enough
saxon
commented
yes
her
brother
went
on
we
can
all
see
it
after
it
happened
when
it
too
but
the
big
men
were
smarter
saxon
remarked
they
were
luckier
tom
contended
some
won
but
most
lost
an
just
as
good
men
lost
it
was
almost
like
a
lot
of
boys
scramblin
on
the
sidewalk
for
a
handful
of
small
change
not
that
some
did
have
but
just
take
your
pa
for
example
he
come
of
good
down
east
stock
that
got
business
instinct
an
can
add
to
what
it
got
now
suppose
your
pa
had
developed
a
weak
heart
or
got
kidney
disease
or
caught
rheumatism
so
he
could
go
gallivantin
an
rainbow
chasin
an
fightin
an
explorin
all
over
the
west
why
most
likely
he
a
settled
down
in
san
francisco
he
to
an
held
onto
them
three
market
street
lots
an
bought
more
lots
of
course
an
gone
into
steamboat
companies
an
stock
gamblin
an
railroad
buildin
why
he
big
business
himself
i
know
he
was
the
most
energetic
man
i
ever
saw
think
quick
as
a
wink
as
cool
as
an
icicle
an
as
wild
as
a
comanche
why
he
a
swath
through
the
free
easy
big
business
gamblers
an
pirates
of
them
days
just
as
he
cut
a
swath
through
the
hearts
of
the
ladies
when
he
went
gallopin
past
on
that
big
horse
of
his
sword
clatterin
spurs
jinglin
his
long
hair
flyin
straight
as
an
indian
an
graceful
as
a
prince
out
of
a
fairy
book
an
a
mexican
caballero
all
rolled
into
one
just
as
he
cut
a
swath
through
the
johnny
rebs
in
civil
war
days
chargin
with
his
men
all
the
way
through
an
back
again
an
like
a
wild
indian
for
more
cady
that
helped
raise
you
told
me
about
that
cady
rode
with
your
why
if
your
pa
only
got
laid
up
in
san
francisco
he
would
one
of
the
big
men
of
the
west
an
in
that
case
right
now
you
be
a
rich
young
woman
travelin
in
europe
with
a
mansion
on
nob
hill
along
with
the
floods
and
crockers
an
holdin
majority
stock
most
likely
in
the
fairmount
hotel
an
a
few
little
concerns
like
it
an
why
ai
you
because
your
pa
was
smart
no
his
mind
was
like
a
steel
trap
because
he
was
filled
to
burstin
an
spillin
over
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
because
he
was
full
of
fire
an
vinegar
an
could
set
down
in
one
place
that
all
the
difference
between
you
an
the
young
women
right
now
in
the
flood
and
crocker
families
your
father
did
catch
rheumatism
at
the
right
time
that
saxon
sighed
then
smiled
just
the
same
i
got
them
beaten
she
said
the
miss
floods
and
miss
crockers
ca
marry
and
i
tom
looked
at
her
taken
aback
for
the
moment
with
admiration
slowly
at
first
growing
in
his
face
well
all
i
got
to
say
he
enunciated
solemnly
is
that
billy
so
lucky
he
do
know
how
lucky
he
not
until
doctor
hentley
gave
the
word
did
the
splints
come
off
arms
and
saxon
insisted
upon
an
additional
two
weeks
delay
so
that
no
risk
would
be
run
these
two
weeks
would
complete
another
month
rent
and
the
landlord
had
agreed
to
wait
payment
for
the
last
two
months
until
billy
was
on
his
feet
again
salinger
awaited
the
day
set
by
saxon
for
taking
back
their
furniture
also
they
had
returned
to
billy
dollars
the
rest
you
paid
will
be
rent
the
collector
told
saxon
and
the
furniture
second
hand
now
too
the
deal
will
be
a
loss
to
and
they
did
have
to
do
it
either
you
know
that
so
just
remember
they
been
pretty
square
with
you
and
if
you
start
over
again
forget
out
of
this
sum
and
out
of
what
was
realized
from
saxon
pretties
they
were
able
to
pay
all
their
small
bills
and
yet
have
a
few
dollars
remaining
in
pocket
i
hate
owin
things
worse
poison
billy
said
to
saxon
an
now
we
do
owe
a
soul
in
this
world
except
the
landlord
an
doc
and
neither
of
them
can
afford
to
wait
longer
than
they
have
to
she
said
and
they
wo
billy
answered
quietly
she
smiled
her
approval
for
she
shared
with
billy
his
horror
of
debt
just
as
both
shared
it
with
that
early
tide
of
pioneers
with
a
puritan
ethic
which
had
settled
the
west
saxon
timed
her
opportunity
when
billy
was
out
of
the
house
to
pack
the
chest
of
drawers
which
had
crossed
the
atlantic
by
sailing
ship
and
the
plains
by
ox
team
she
kissed
the
bullet
hole
in
it
made
in
the
fight
at
little
meadow
as
she
kissed
her
father
sword
the
while
she
visioned
him
as
she
always
did
astride
his
roan
warhorse
with
the
old
religious
awe
she
pored
over
her
mother
poems
in
the
and
clasped
her
mother
red
satin
spanish
girdle
about
her
in
a
farewell
embrace
she
unpacked
the
in
order
to
gaze
a
last
time
at
the
wood
engraving
of
the
vikings
sword
in
hand
leaping
upon
the
english
sands
again
she
identified
billy
as
one
of
the
vikings
and
pondered
for
a
space
on
the
strange
wanderings
of
the
seed
from
which
she
sprang
always
had
her
race
been
and
she
took
delight
in
believing
she
had
bred
true
for
had
not
she
despite
her
life
passed
in
a
city
found
this
same
in
her
and
was
she
not
going
forth
to
satisfy
that
hunger
just
as
her
people
of
old
time
had
done
as
her
father
and
mother
before
her
she
remembered
her
mother
tale
of
how
the
promised
land
looked
to
them
as
their
battered
wagons
and
weary
oxen
dropped
down
through
the
early
winter
snows
of
the
sierras
to
the
vast
and
flowering
of
california
in
fancy
herself
a
child
of
nine
she
looked
down
from
the
snowy
heights
as
her
mother
must
have
looked
down
she
recalled
and
repeated
aloud
one
of
her
mother
stanzas
as
a
airy
strains
your
gentle
muse
has
learned
to
sing
and
california
boundless
plains
prolong
the
soft
notes
echoing
she
sighed
happily
and
dried
her
eyes
perhaps
the
hard
times
were
past
perhaps
they
had
constituted
her
plains
and
she
and
billy
had
won
safely
across
and
were
even
then
climbing
the
sierras
ere
they
dropped
down
into
the
pleasant
valley
land
salinger
wagon
was
at
the
house
taking
out
the
furniture
the
morning
they
left
the
landlord
standing
at
the
gate
received
the
keys
shook
hands
with
them
and
wished
them
luck
you
goin
at
it
right
he
congratulated
them
sure
an
was
it
under
me
roll
of
blankets
i
tramped
into
oakland

year
ago

along
that
small
bit
of
rent
an
good
luck
an
do
mind
what
people
think
is
them
that
looks
that
curious
neighbors
peeped
from
behind
the
blinds
as
billy
and
saxon
strode
up
the
street
while
the
children
gazed
at
them
in
gaping
astonishment
on
billy
back
inside
a
painted
canvas
tarpaulin
was
slung
the
roll
of
bedding
inside
the
roll
were
changes
of
underclothing
and
odds
and
ends
of
necessaries
outside
from
the
lashings
depended
a
frying
pan
and
cooking
pail
in
his
hand
he
carried
the
coffee
pot
saxon
carried
a
small
telescope
basket
protected
by
black
oilcloth
and
across
her
back
was
the
tiny
ukulele
case
we
must
look
like
holy
frights
billy
grumbled
shrinking
from
every
gaze
that
was
bent
upon
him
it
be
all
right
if
we
were
going
camping
saxon
consoled
only
we
but
they
do
know
that
she
continued
it
only
you
know
that
and
what
you
think
they
thinking
is
what
they
thinking
at
all
most
probably
they
think
we
going
camping
and
the
best
of
it
is
we
are
going
camping
we
are
we
are
at
this
billy
cheered
up
though
he
muttered
his
firm
intention
to
knock
the
block
off
of
any
guy
that
got
fresh
he
stole
a
glance
at
saxon
her
cheeks
were
red
her
eyes
glowing
say
he
said
suddenly
i
seen
an
opera
once
where
fellows
wandered
over
the
country
with
guitars
slung
on
their
backs
just
like
you
with
that
you
made
me
think
of
them
they
was
always
that
what
i
brought
it
along
for
saxon
answered
and
when
we
go
down
country
roads
we
sing
as
we
go
along
and
sing
by
the
campfires
too
we
going
camping
that
all
taking
a
vacation
and
seeing
the
country
so
why
should
we
have
a
good
time
why
we
do
even
know
where
we
going
to
sleep
or
any
night
think
of
the
fun
it
a
sporting
proposition
all
right
all
right
billy
considered
but
just
the
same
let
turn
off
an
go
around
the
block
some
fellows
i
know
standin
up
there
on
the
next
corner
an
i
want
to
knock
their
blocks
book
iii
chapter
i
the
car
ran
as
far
as
hayward
but
at
saxon
suggestion
they
got
off
at
san
leandro
it
does
matter
where
we
start
walking
she
said
for
start
to
walk
somewhere
we
must
and
as
we
looking
for
land
and
finding
out
about
land
the
quicker
we
begin
to
investigate
the
better
besides
we
want
to
know
all
about
all
kinds
of
land
close
to
the
big
cities
as
well
as
back
in
the
gee
this
must
be
the
porchugeeze
headquarters
was
reiterated
comment
as
they
walked
through
san
leandro
it
looks
as
though
they
crowd
our
kind
out
saxon
adjudged
some
tall
crowdin
i
guess
billy
grumbled
it
looks
like
the
american
ai
got
no
room
left
in
his
own
then
it
his
own
fault
saxon
said
with
vague
asperity
resenting
conditions
she
was
just
beginning
to
grasp
oh
i
do
know
about
that
i
reckon
the
american
could
do
what
the
porchugeeze
do
if
he
wanted
to
only
he
do
want
to
thank
god
he
ai
much
given
to
livin
like
a
pig
offen
not
in
the
country
maybe
saxon
controverted
but
i
seen
an
awful
lot
of
americans
living
like
pigs
in
the
billy
grunted
unwilling
assent
i
guess
they
quit
the
farms
an
go
to
the
city
for
something
better
an
get
it
in
the
look
at
all
the
children
saxon
cried
school
letting
out
and
nearly
all
are
portuguese
billy
not
porchugeeze
mercedes
taught
me
the
right
they
never
wore
glad
rags
like
them
in
the
old
country
billy
sneered
they
had
to
come
over
here
to
get
decent
clothes
and
decent
grub
they
as
fat
as
saxon
nodded
affirmation
and
a
great
light
seemed
suddenly
to
kindle
in
her
understanding
that
the
very
point
billy
they
doing
it
doing
it
farming
too
strikes
do
bother
you
do
call
that
dinky
gardening
farming
he
objected
pointing
to
a
piece
of
land
barely
the
size
of
an
acre
which
they
were
passing
oh
your
ideas
are
still
big
she
laughed
you
like
uncle
will
who
owned
thousands
of
acres
and
wanted
to
own
a
million
and
who
wound
up
as
night
watchman
that
what
was
the
trouble
with
all
us
americans
everything
large
scale
anything
less
than
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
was
small
just
the
same
billy
held
stubbornly
large
scale
a
whole
lot
small
scale
like
all
these
dinky
saxon
sighed
i
do
know
which
is
the
dinkier
she
observed
finally
owning
a
few
little
acres
and
the
team
you
driving
or
not
owning
any
acres
and
driving
a
team
somebody
else
owns
for
billy
winced
go
on
robinson
crusoe
he
growled
good
naturedly
rub
it
in
good
an
plenty
an
the
worst
of
it
is
it
correct
a
hell
of
a
american
i
been
adrivin
other
folkses
teams
for
a
livin
and
scabs
an
not
bein
able
to
keep
up
with
the
installments
for
a
few
sticks
of
furniture
just
the
same
i
was
sorry
for
one
thing
i
hated
worse
sam
hill
to
see
that
morris
chair
go
back
you
liked
it
so
we
did
a
lot
of
honeymoonin
in
that
they
were
well
out
of
san
leandro
walking
through
a
region
of
tiny
holdings
farmlets
billy
called
them
and
saxon
got
out
her
ukulele
to
cheer
him
with
a
song
first
it
was
treat
my
daughter
and
then
she
swung
into
darky
hymns
beginning
with
oh
de
judgmen
day
am
rollin
roun
rollin
yes
i
hear
the
trumpets
awful
soun
rollin
yes
a
big
touring
car
dashing
past
threw
a
dusty
pause
in
her
singing
and
saxon
delivered
herself
of
her
latest
wisdom
now
billy
remember
we
not
going
to
take
up
with
the
first
piece
of
land
we
see
we
got
to
go
into
this
with
our
eyes
open
an
they
ai
open
yet
he
agreed
and
we
got
to
get
them
open
them
that
looks
that
finds
there
lots
of
time
to
learn
things
we
do
care
if
it
takes
months
and
months
we
footloose
a
good
start
is
better
than
a
dozen
bad
ones
we
got
to
talk
and
find
out
we
talk
with
everybody
we
meet
ask
questions
ask
everybody
it
the
only
way
to
find
i
ai
much
of
a
hand
at
askin
questions
billy
demurred
then
i
ask
she
cried
we
got
to
win
out
at
this
game
and
the
way
is
to
know
look
at
all
these
portuguese
where
are
all
the
americans
they
owned
the
land
first
after
the
mexicans
what
made
the
americans
clear
out
how
do
the
portuguese
make
it
go
do
you
see
we
got
to
ask
millions
of
she
strummed
a
few
chords
and
then
her
clear
sweet
voice
rang
out
gaily
i
back
to
dixie
i
back
to
dixie
i
where
de
orange
blossoms
grow
for
i
hear
de
chillun
callin
i
see
de
sad
tears
fallin
my
heart
turned
back
to
dixie
an
i
she
broke
off
to
exclaim
oh
what
a
lovely
place
see
that
arbor
just
covered
with
grapes
again
and
again
she
was
attracted
by
the
small
places
they
passed
now
it
was
look
at
the
flowers
or
my
those
vegetables
or
see
they
got
a
cow
men
americans
driving
along
in
buggies
or
runabouts
looked
at
saxon
and
billy
curiously
this
saxon
could
brook
far
easier
than
could
billy
who
would
mutter
and
grumble
deep
in
his
throat
beside
the
road
they
came
upon
a
lineman
eating
his
lunch
stop
and
talk
saxon
whispered
aw
what
the
good
he
a
lineman
what
he
know
about
farmin
you
never
can
tell
he
our
kind
go
ahead
billy
you
just
speak
to
him
he
is
working
now
anyway
and
he
be
more
likely
to
talk
see
that
tree
in
there
just
inside
the
gate
and
the
way
the
branches
are
grown
together
it
a
curiosity
ask
him
about
it
that
a
good
way
to
get
billy
stopped
when
they
were
alongside
how
do
you
do
he
said
gruffly
the
lineman
a
young
fellow
paused
in
the
cracking
of
a
egg
to
stare
up
at
the
couple
how
do
you
do
he
said
billy
swung
his
pack
from
his
shoulders
to
the
ground
and
saxon
rested
her
telescope
basket
peddlin
the
young
man
asked
too
discreet
to
put
his
question
directly
to
saxon
yet
dividing
it
between
her
and
billy
and
cocking
his
eye
at
the
covered
basket
no
she
spoke
up
quickly
we
looking
for
land
do
you
know
of
any
around
here
again
he
desisted
from
the
egg
studying
them
with
sharp
eyes
as
if
to
fathom
their
financial
status
do
you
know
what
land
sells
for
around
here
he
asked
no
saxon
answered
do
you
i
guess
i
ought
to
i
was
born
here
and
land
like
this
all
around
you
runs
at
from
two
to
three
hundred
to
four
an
five
hundred
dollars
an
whew
billy
whistled
i
guess
we
do
want
none
of
but
what
makes
it
that
high
town
lots
saxon
wanted
to
know
nope
the
porchugeeze
make
it
that
high
i
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
land
that
fetched
a
hundred
an
acre
billy
said
oh
them
times
is
past
they
used
to
give
away
land
once
an
if
you
was
good
throw
in
all
the
cattle
runnin
on
how
about
government
land
around
here
was
next
query
ai
none
an
never
was
this
was
old
mexican
grants
my
grandfather
bought
sixteen
hundred
of
the
best
acres
around
here
for
fifteen
hundred
dollars
five
hundred
down
an
the
balance
in
five
years
without
interest
but
that
was
in
the
early
days
he
come
west
in
tryin
to
find
a
country
without
chills
an
he
found
it
all
right
said
billy
you
bet
he
did
an
if
him
an
father
held
onto
the
land
it
been
better
than
a
gold
mine
an
i
would
be
workin
for
a
livin
your
business
ben
in
the
strike
in
oakland
sure
thing
i
teamed
there
most
of
my
here
the
two
men
wandered
off
into
a
discussion
of
union
affairs
and
the
strike
situation
but
saxon
refused
to
be
balked
and
brought
back
the
talk
to
the
land
how
was
it
the
portuguese
ran
up
the
price
of
land
she
asked
the
young
fellow
broke
away
from
union
matters
with
an
effort
and
for
a
moment
regarded
her
with
lack
luster
eyes
until
the
question
sank
into
his
consciousness
because
they
worked
the
land
overtime
because
they
worked
mornin
noon
an
night
all
hands
women
an
kids
because
they
could
get
more
out
of
twenty
acres
than
we
could
out
of
a
hundred
an
sixty
look
at
old
silva
antonio
silva
i
known
him
ever
since
i
was
a
shaver
he
did
have
the
price
of
a
square
meal
when
he
hit
this
section
and
begun
leasin
land
from
my
folks
look
at
him
now
worth
two
hundred
an
fifty
thousan
cold
an
i
bet
he
got
credit
for
a
million
there
no
tellin
what
the
rest
of
his
family
and
he
made
all
that
out
of
your
folks
land
saxon
demanded
the
young
man
nodded
his
head
with
evident
reluctance
then
why
did
your
folks
do
it
she
pursued
the
lineman
shrugged
his
shoulders
search
me
he
said
but
the
money
was
in
the
land
she
persisted
blamed
if
it
was
came
the
retort
tinged
slightly
with
color
we
never
saw
it
stickin
out
so
as
you
could
notice
it
the
money
was
in
the
hands
of
the
porchugeeze
i
guess
they
knew
a
few
more
we
did
that
saxon
showed
such
dissatisfaction
with
his
explanation
that
he
was
stung
to
action
he
got
up
wrathfully
come
on
an
i
show
you
he
said
i
show
you
why
i
workin
for
wages
when
i
might
a
millionaire
if
my
folks
had
been
mutts
that
what
we
old
americans
are
mutts
with
a
capital
he
led
them
inside
the
gate
to
the
fruit
tree
that
had
first
attracted
saxon
attention
from
the
main
crotch
diverged
the
four
main
branches
of
the
tree
two
feet
above
the
crotch
the
branches
were
connected
each
to
the
ones
on
both
sides
by
braces
of
living
wood
you
think
it
growed
that
way
eh
well
it
did
but
it
was
old
silva
that
made
it
just
the
same
caught
two
sprouts
when
the
tree
was
young
an

a
natural
springy
brace
an
beats
iron
braces
stiff
look
along
all
the
rows
every
tree

an
that
just
one
trick
of
the
porchugeeze
they
got
a
million
like
it
figure
it
out
for
yourself
they
do
need
props
when
the
heavy
why
when
we
had
a
heavy
crop
we
used
to
use
five
props
to
a
tree
now
take
ten
acres
of
trees
that
be
some
several
props
which
cost
money
an
labor
to
put
in
an
take
out
every
year
these
here
natural
braces
do
have
to
have
a
thing
done
all
the
time
why
the
porchugeeze
has
got
us
skinned
a
mile
come
on
i
show
billy
with
city
notions
of
trespass
betrayed
perturbation
at
the
freedom
they
were
making
of
the
little
farm
oh
it
all
right
as
long
as
you
do
step
on
nothin
the
lineman
reassured
him
besides
my
grandfather
used
to
own
this
they
know
me
forty
years
ago
old
silva
come
from
the
azores
went
in
the
mountains
for
a
couple
of
years
then
blew
in
to
san
leandro
these
five
acres
was
the
first
land
he
leased
that
was
the
beginnin
then
he
began
leasin
by
the
hundreds
of
acres

by
the
an
his
sisters
an
his
uncles
an
his
aunts
begun
pourin
in
from
the
azores
they
all
related
there
you

pretty
soon

old
silva
wound
up
by
buyin
these
five
acres
from
grandfather
pretty
soon
an
father
by
that
time
was
in
the
hole
to
the
neck
he
was
buyin
father
land
by
the
an
all
the
rest
of
his
relations
was
doin
the
same
thing
father
was
always
gettin
rich
quick
an
he
wound
up
by
dyin
in
debt
but
old
silva
never
overlooked
a
bet
no
matter
how
dinky
an
all
the
rest
are
just
like
him
you
see
outside
the
fence
there
clear
to
the
in
the
road
we
to
do
a
picayune
thing
like
that
not
silva
why
he
got
a
town
house
in
san
leandro
now
an
he
rides
around
in
a
tourin
car
an
just
the
same
his
front
door
yard
grows
onions
clear
to
the
sidewalk
he
clears
three
hundred
a
year
on
that
patch
alone
i
know
ten
acres
of
land
he
bought
last
year
a
thousan
an
acre
they
asked
an
he
never
batted
an
eye
he
knew
it
was
worth
it
that
all
he
knew
he
could
make
it
pay
back
in
the
hills
there
he
got
a
ranch
of
five
hundred
an
eighty
acres
bought
it
dirt
cheap
too
an
i
want
to
tell
you
i
could
travel
around
in
a
different
tourin
car
every
day
in
the
week
just
outa
the
profits
he
makes
on
that
ranch
from
the
horses
all
the
way
from
heavy
draughts
to
fancy
steppers
but
how
how
how
did
he
get
it
all
saxon
clamored
by
bein
wise
to
farmin
why
the
whole
blame
family
works
they
ai
ashamed
to
roll
up
their
sleeves
an
dig
sons
an
daughters
old
man
old
woman
an
the
babies
they
have
a
that
a
kid
four
years
old
that
ca
pasture
one
cow
on
the
county
road
an
keep
it
fat
ai
worth
his
salt
why
the
silvas
the
whole
tribe
of
works
a
hundred
acres
in
peas
eighty
in
tomatoes
thirty
in
asparagus
ten
in
forty
in
cucumbers
an
oh
stacks
of
other
but
how
do
they
do
it
saxon
continued
to
demand
we
never
been
ashamed
to
work
we
worked
hard
all
our
lives
i
can
any
portuguese
woman
ever
born
and
i
done
it
too
in
the
jute
mills
there
were
lots
of
portuguese
girls
working
at
the
looms
all
around
me
and
i
could
them
every
day
and
i
did
too
it
is
a
case
of
work
what
is
it
the
lineman
looked
at
her
in
a
troubled
way
many
the
time
i
asked
myself
that
same
question
these
cheap
emigrants
i
say
to
myself
was
here
first
an
owned
the
land
i
can
lick
any
dago
that
ever
hatched
in
the
azores
i
got
a
better
education
then
how
in
thunder
do
they
put
it
all
over
us
get
our
land
an
start
accounts
in
the
banks
an
the
only
answer
i
know
is
that
we
ai
got
the
sabe
we
do
use
our
right
something
wrong
with
us
anyway
we
was
wised
up
to
farming
we
played
at
it
show
you
that
what
i
brung
you
in
for
the
way
old
silva
an
all
his
tribe
farms
look
at
this
place
some
cousin
of
his
just
out
from
the
azores
is
makin
a
start
on
it
an
payin
good
rent
to
silva
pretty
soon
he
be
up
to
snuff
an
buyin
land
for
himself
from
some
perishin
american
farmer
look
at
that
though
you
ought
to
see
it
in
summer
not
an
inch
wasted
where
we
got
one
thin
crop
they
get
four
fat
crops
an
look
at
the
way
they
crowd
it
currants
between
the
tree
rows
beans
between
the
currant
rows
a
row
of
beans
close
on
each
side
of
the
trees
an
rows
of
beans
along
the
ends
of
the
tree
rows
why
silva
would
sell
these
five
acres
for
five
hundred
an
acre
cash
down
he
gave
grandfather
fifty
an
acre
for
it
on
long
time
an
here
am
i
workin
for
the
telephone
company
an
putting
in
a
telephone
for
old
silva
cousin
from
the
azores
that
ca
speak
american
yet
along
the
road
say
when
silva
swung
that
trick
he
made
more
outa
fattenin
hogs
with
than
grandfather
made
with
all
his
farmin
grandfather
stuck
up
his
nose
at
he
died
with
it
stuck
up
an
with
more
mortgages
on
the
land
he
had
left
than
you
could
shake
a
stick
at
tomatoes
wrapped
up
in
wrappin
paper
ever
heard
of
that
father
snorted
when
he
first
seen
the
porchugeeze
doin
it
an
he
went
on
snortin
just
the
same
they
got
bumper
crops
an
father
of
tomatoes
was
eaten
by
the
black
beetles
we
ai
got
the
sabe
or
the
knack
or
something
or
other
just
look
at
this
piece
of
ground
four
crops
a
year
an
every
inch
of
soil
workin
over
time
why
back
in
town
there
there
single
acres
that
earns
more
than
fifty
of
ours
in
the
old
days
the
porchugeeze
is
farmers
all
an
we
do
know
nothin
about
farmin
an
never
saxon
talked
with
the
lineman
following
him
about
till
one
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
said
good
bye
and
returned
to
his
task
of
putting
in
a
telephone
for
the
latest
immigrant
from
the
azores
when
in
town
saxon
carried
her
telescope
in
her
hand
but
it
was
so
arranged
with
loops
that
once
on
the
road
she
could
thrust
her
arms
through
the
loops
and
carry
it
on
her
back
when
she
did
this
the
tiny
ukulele
case
was
shifted
so
that
it
hung
under
her
left
arm
a
mile
on
from
the
lineman
they
stopped
where
a
small
creek
fringed
with
brush
crossed
the
county
road
billy
was
for
the
cold
lunch
which
was
the
last
meal
saxon
had
prepared
in
the
pine
street
cottage
but
she
was
determined
upon
building
a
fire
and
boiling
coffee
not
that
she
desired
it
for
herself
but
that
she
was
impressed
with
the
idea
that
everything
at
the
starting
of
their
strange
wandering
must
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
for
billy
sake
bent
on
inspiring
him
with
enthusiasm
equal
to
her
own
she
declined
to
dampen
what
sparks
he
had
caught
by
anything
so
uncheerful
as
a
cold
meal
now
one
thing
we
want
to
get
out
of
our
heads
right
at
the
start
billy
is
that
we
in
a
hurry
we
not
in
a
hurry
and
we
do
care
whether
school
keeps
or
not
we
out
to
have
a
good
time
a
regular
adventure
like
you
read
about
in
my
i
wish
that
boy
that
took
me
fishing
to
goat
island
could
see
me
now
oakland
was
just
a
place
to
start
from
he
said
and
well
we
started
have
we
and
right
here
where
we
stop
and
boil
coffee
you
get
the
fire
going
billy
and
i
get
the
water
and
the
things
ready
to
spread
say
billy
remarked
while
they
waited
for
the
water
to
boil
d
know
what
this
reminds
me
of
saxon
was
certain
she
did
know
but
she
shook
her
head
she
wanted
to
hear
him
say
it
why
the
second
sunday
i
knew
you
when
we
drove
out
to
moraga
valley
behind
prince
and
king
you
spread
the
lunch
that
only
it
was
a
more
scrumptious
lunch
she
added
with
a
happy
smile
but
i
wonder
why
we
did
have
coffee
that
day
he
went
on
perhaps
it
would
have
been
too
much
like
housekeeping
she
laughed
kind
of
what
mary
would
call
indelicate
or
raw
billy
interpolated
she
was
always
springin
that
and
yet
look
what
became
of
that
the
way
with
all
of
them
billy
growled
somberly
i
always
noticed
it
the
fastidious
ones
that
turn
out
the
rottenest
they
like
some
horses
i
know
at
the
things
they
the
least
afraid
saxon
was
silent
oppressed
by
a
sadness
vague
and
remote
which
the
mention
of
bert
widow
had
served
to
bring
on
i
know
something
else
that
happened
that
day
which
you
never
guess
billy
reminisced
i
bet
you
could
i
wonder
saxon
murmured
and
guessed
it
with
her
eyes
billy
eyes
answered
and
quite
spontaneously
he
reached
over
caught
her
hand
and
pressed
it
caressingly
to
his
cheek
it
little
but
oh
my
he
said
addressing
the
imprisoned
hand
then
he
gazed
at
saxon
and
she
warmed
with
his
words
we
courtin
all
over
again
ai
we
both
ate
heartily
and
billy
was
guilty
of
three
cups
of
coffee
say
this
country
air
gives
some
appetite
he
mumbled
as
he
sank
his
teeth
into
his
fifth
sandwich
i
could
eat
a
horse
drown
his
head
off
in
coffee
saxon
mind
had
reverted
to
all
the
young
lineman
had
told
her
and
she
completed
a
sort
of
general
resume
of
the
information
my
she
exclaimed
but
we
learned
a
lot
an
we
sure
learned
one
thing
billy
said
an
that
is
that
this
is
no
place
for
us
with
land
a
thousan
an
acre
an
only
twenty
dollars
in
our
oh
we
not
going
to
stop
here
she
hastened
to
say
but
just
the
same
it
the
portuguese
that
gave
it
its
price
and
they
make
things
go
on
it
send
their
children
to
school
and
have
them
and
as
you
said
yourself
they
as
fat
as
an
i
take
my
hat
off
to
them
billy
responded
but
all
the
same
i
sooner
have
forty
acres
at
a
hundred
an
acre
than
four
at
a
thousan
an
acre
somehow
you
know
i
be
scared
stiff
on
four
acres
scared
of
fallin
off
you
she
was
in
full
sympathy
with
him
in
her
heart
of
hearts
the
forty
acres
tugged
much
the
harder
in
her
way
allowing
for
the
difference
of
a
generation
her
desire
for
spaciousness
was
as
strong
as
her
uncle
will
well
we
not
going
to
stop
here
she
assured
billy
we
going
in
not
for
forty
acres
but
for
a
hundred
and
sixty
acres
free
from
the
an
i
guess
the
government
owes
it
to
us
for
what
our
fathers
mothers
done
i
tell
you
saxon
when
a
woman
walks
across
the
plains
like
your
mother
done
an
a
man
an
wife
gets
massacred
by
the
indians
like
my
grandfather
an
mother
done
the
government
does
owe
them
well
it
up
to
us
to
an
we
collect
all
right
all
right
somewhere
down
in
them
redwood
mountains
south
of
chapter
ii
it
was
a
good
afternoon
tramp
to
niles
passing
through
the
town
of
haywards
yet
saxon
and
billy
found
time
to
diverge
from
the
main
county
road
and
take
the
parallel
roads
through
acres
of
intense
cultivation
where
the
land
was
farmed
to
the
saxon
looked
with
amazement
at
these
small
immigrants
who
came
to
the
soil
with
nothing
and
yet
made
the
soil
pay
for
itself
to
the
tune
of
two
hundred
of
five
hundred
and
of
a
thousand
dollars
an
acre
on
every
hand
was
activity
women
and
children
were
in
the
fields
as
well
as
men
the
land
was
turned
endlessly
over
and
over
they
seemed
never
to
let
it
rest
and
it
rewarded
them
it
must
reward
them
or
their
children
would
not
be
able
to
go
to
school
nor
would
so
many
of
them
be
able
to
drive
by
in
rattletrap
buggies
or
in
stout
light
wagons
look
at
their
faces
saxon
said
they
are
happy
and
contented
they
have
faces
like
the
people
in
our
neighborhood
after
the
strikes
oh
sure
they
got
a
good
thing
billy
agreed
you
can
see
it
stickin
out
all
over
them
but
they
need
get
chesty
with
me
i
can
tell
you
that
much
just
because
they
jiggerooed
us
out
of
our
land
an
but
they
not
showing
any
signs
of
chestiness
saxon
demurred
no
they
not
come
to
think
of
it
all
the
same
they
ai
so
wise
i
bet
i
could
tell
a
few
about
it
was
sunset
when
they
entered
the
little
town
of
niles
billy
who
had
been
silent
for
the
last
half
mile
hesitantly
ventured
a
suggestion
say
i
could
put
up
for
a
room
in
the
hotel
just
as
well
as
not
what
d
think
but
saxon
shook
her
head
emphatically
how
long
do
you
think
our
twenty
dollars
will
last
at
that
rate
besides
the
only
way
to
begin
is
to
begin
at
the
beginning
we
plan
sleeping
in
all
right
he
gave
in
i
game
i
was
just
thinkin
about
then
you
better
think
i
game
too
she
flashed
forgivingly
and
now
we
have
to
see
about
getting
things
for
they
bought
a
round
steak
potatoes
onions
and
a
dozen
eating
apples
then
went
out
from
the
town
to
the
fringe
of
trees
and
brush
that
advertised
a
creek
beside
the
trees
on
a
sand
bank
they
pitched
camp
plenty
of
dry
wood
lay
about
and
billy
whistled
genially
while
he
gathered
and
chopped
saxon
keen
to
follow
his
every
mood
was
cheered
by
the
atrocious
discord
on
his
lips
she
smiled
to
herself
as
she
spread
the
blankets
with
the
tarpaulin
underneath
for
a
table
having
first
removed
all
twigs
from
the
sand
she
had
much
to
learn
in
the
matter
of
cooking
over
a
and
made
fair
progress
discovering
first
of
all
that
control
of
the
fire
meant
far
more
than
the
size
of
it
when
the
coffee
was
boiled
she
settled
the
grounds
with
a
of
cold
water
and
placed
the
pot
on
the
edge
of
the
coals
where
it
would
keep
hot
and
yet
not
boil
she
fried
potato
dollars
and
onions
in
the
same
pan
but
separately
and
set
them
on
top
of
the
coffee
pot
in
the
tin
plate
she
was
to
eat
from
covering
it
with
billy
inverted
plate
on
the
dry
hot
pan
in
the
way
that
delighted
billy
she
fried
the
steak
this
completed
and
while
billy
poured
the
coffee
she
served
the
steak
putting
the
dollars
and
onions
back
into
the
frying
pan
for
a
moment
to
make
them
piping
hot
again
what
more
d
want
than
this
billy
challenged
with
satisfaction
in
the
pause
after
his
final
cup
of
coffee
while
he
rolled
a
cigarette
he
lay
on
his
side
full
length
resting
on
his
elbow
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
saxon
color
was
heightened
by
the
flickering
flames
now
our
folks
when
they
was
on
the
move
had
to
be
afraid
for
indians
and
wild
animals
and
all
sorts
of
things
here
we
are
as
safe
as
bugs
in
a
rug
take
this
sand
what
better
bed
could
you
ask
soft
as
feathers
say
you
look
good
to
me
heap
little
squaw
i
bet

an
inch
over
sixteen
right
now
do
i
she
glowed
with
a
flirt
of
the
head
sideward
and
a
white
flash
of
teeth
if
you
were
smoking
a
cigarette
i
ask
you
if
your
mother
knew
you
out
say
he
began
with
transparently
feigned
seriousness
i
want
to
ask

something
if

do
mind
now
of
course
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelin
or

but

the
same
there
something
important
i
like
to
well

is
it
she
inquired
after
a
fruitless
wait
well
it
just
this
saxon
i
like
you
like
anything
an
all
that
but
here
night

an
we
a
thousand
miles
from
anywhere
and
well
what
i
wanta

is
are
we
really
an
truly
married

an
me
really
and
truly
she
assured
him
why
oh
nothing
but
i
kind
an
i
was
gettin
embarrassed
you
know
because
if
we
was
seein
the
way
i
was
brought
up
be
no
place
that
will
do
you
she
said
severely
and
this
is
just
the
time
and
place
for
you
to
get
in
the
firewood
for
morning
while
i
wash
up
the
dishes
and
put
the
kitchen
in
he
started
to
obey
but
paused
to
throw
his
arm
about
her
and
draw
her
close
neither
spoke
but
when
he
went
his
way
saxon
breast
was
fluttering
and
a
song
of
thanksgiving
breathed
on
her
lips
the
night
had
come
on
dim
with
the
light
of
faint
stars
but
these
had
disappeared
behind
clouds
that
seemed
to
have
arisen
from
nowhere
it
was
the
beginning
of
california
indian
summer
the
air
was
warm
with
just
the
first
hint
of
evening
chill
and
there
was
no
wind
i
a
feeling
as
if
we
just
started
to
live
saxon
said
when
billy
his
firewood
collected
joined
her
on
the
blankets
before
the
fire
i
learned
more
than
ten
years
in
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
braced
her
shoulders
farming
a
bigger
subject
than
i
billy
said
nothing
with
steady
eyes
he
was
staring
into
the
fire
and
she
knew
he
was
turning
something
over
in
his
mind
what
is
it
she
asked
when
she
saw
he
had
reached
a
conclusion
at
the
same
time
resting
her
hand
on
the
back
of
his
just
been
framin
up
that
ranch
of
ourn
he
answered
it
all
well
enough
these
dinky
farmlets
they
do
for
foreigners
but
we
americans
just
got
ta
have
room
i
want
to
be
able
to
look
at
a
hilltop
an
know
it
my
land
and
know
it
my
land
down
the
other
side
an
up
the
next
hilltop
an
know
that
over
beyond
that
down
alongside
some
creek
my
mares
are
most
likely
grazin
an
their
little
colts
with
or
kickin
up
their
heels
you
know
there
money
in
horses
especially
the
big
workhorses
that
run
to
eighteen
hundred
two
thousand
pounds
they
payin
for
in
the
cities
every
day
in
the
year
seven
an
eight
hundred
a
pair
matched
geldings
four
years
old
good
pasture
an
plenty
of
it
in
this
kind
of
a
climate
is
all
they
need
along
with
some
sort
of
shelter
an
a
little
hay
in
long
spells
of
bad
weather
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
let
me
tell
you
that
this
ranch
proposition
is
beginnin
to
look
good
to
saxon
was
all
excitement
here
was
new
information
on
the
cherished
subject
and
best
of
all
billy
was
the
authority
still
better
he
was
taking
an
interest
himself
there
be
room
for
that
and
for
everything
on
a
quarter
section
she
encouraged
sure
thing
around
the
house
we
have
vegetables
an
fruit
and
chickens
an
everything
just
like
the
porchugeeze
an
plenty
of
room
beside
to
walk
around
an
range
the
but
wo
the
colts
cost
money
billy
not
much
the
cobblestones
eat
horses
up
fast
that
where
i
get
my
brood
mares
from
the
ones
knocked
out
by
the
city
i
know
that
end
of
it
they
sell
at
auction
an
they
good
for
years
an
years
only
no
good
on
the
cobbles
any
there
ensued
a
long
pause
in
the
dying
fire
both
were
busy
visioning
the
farm
to
be
it
pretty
still
ai
it
billy
said
rousing
himself
at
last
he
gazed
about
him
an
black
as
a
stack
of
black
he
shivered
buttoned
his
coat
and
tossed
several
sticks
on
the
fire
just
the
same
it
the
best
kind
of
a
climate
in
the
world
many
the
time
when
i
was
a
little
kid
i
heard
my
father
brag
about
bein
a
blanket
climate
he
went
east
once
an
staid
a
summer
an
a
winter
an
got
all
he
wanted
never
again
for
my
mother
said
there
never
was
such
a
land
for
climate
how
wonderful
it
must
have
seemed
to
them
after
crossing
the
deserts
and
mountains
they
called
it
the
land
of
milk
and
honey
the
ground
was
so
rich
that
all
they
needed
to
do
was
scratch
it
cady
used
to
and
wild
game
everywhere
billy
contributed
mr
roberts
the
one
that
adopted
my
father
he
drove
cattle
from
the
san
joaquin
to
the
columbia
river
he
had
forty
men
helpin
him
an
all
they
took
along
was
powder
an
salt
they
lived
off
the
game
they
the
hills
were
full
of
deer
and
my
mother
saw
whole
herds
of
elk
around
santa
rosa
some
time
we
go
there
billy
i
always
wanted
and
when
my
father
was
a
young
man
somewhere
up
north
of
sacramento
in
a
creek
called
cache
slough
the
tules
was
full
of
grizzlies
he
used
to
go
in
an
shoot
an
when
they
caught
in
the
open
he
the
mexicans
used
to
ride
up
an
rope
them
catch
them
with
lariats
you
know
he
said
a
horse
that
was
afraid
of
grizzlies
fetched
ten
times
as
much
as
any
other
horse
an
panthers
all
the
old
folks
called
painters
an
catamounts
an
varmints
yes
we
go
to
santa
rosa
some
time
maybe
we
wo
like
that
land
down
the
coast
an
have
to
keep
on
by
this
time
the
fire
had
died
down
and
saxon
had
finished
brushing
and
braiding
her
hair
their
preliminaries
were
simple
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
side
by
side
under
the
blankets
saxon
closed
her
eyes
but
could
not
sleep
on
the
contrary
she
had
never
been
more
wide
awake
she
had
never
slept
out
of
doors
in
her
life
and
by
no
exertion
of
will
could
she
overcome
the
strangeness
of
it
in
addition
she
was
stiffened
from
the
long
trudge
and
the
sand
to
her
surprise
was
anything
but
soft
an
hour
passed
she
tried
to
believe
that
billy
was
asleep
but
felt
certain
he
was
not
the
sharp
crackle
of
a
dying
ember
startled
her
she
was
confident
that
billy
had
moved
slightly
billy
she
whispered
are
you
awake
yep
came
his
low
answer
an
thinkin
this
sand
is
a
cement
floor
it
one
on
me
all
right
but
who
it
both
shifted
their
postures
slightly
but
vain
was
the
attempt
to
escape
from
the
dull
aching
contact
of
the
sand
an
abrupt
metallic
whirring
noise
of
some
nearby
cricket
gave
saxon
another
startle
she
endured
the
sound
for
some
minutes
until
billy
broke
forth
say
that
gets
my
goat
whatever
it
do
you
think
it
a
rattlesnake
she
asked
maintaining
a
calmness
she
did
not
feel
just
what
i
been
i
saw
two
in
the
window
of
bowman
drug
store
an
you
know
billy
they
got
a
hollow
fang
and
when
they
stick
it
into
you
the
poison
runs
down
the
billy
shivered
in
fear
that
was
not
altogether
mockery
certain
death
everybody
says
unless
you
a
bosco
remember
him
he
eats
alive
he
eats
alive
bosco
bosco
saxon
responded
mimicking
the
cry
of
a
barker
just
the
same
all
rattlers
had
the
cut
outa
them
they
must
gee
funny
i
ca
get
asleep
i
wish
that
damned
thing
close
its
trap
i
wonder
if
it
is
a
no
it
ca
be
saxon
decided
all
the
rattlesnakes
are
killed
off
long
then
where
did
bosco
get
his
billy
demanded
with
unimpeachable
logic
an
why
do
you
get
to
sleep
because
it
all
new
i
guess
was
her
reply
you
see
i
never
camped
out
in
my
neither
did
i
an
until
now
i
always
thought
it
was
a
he
changed
his
position
on
the
maddening
sand
and
sighed
heavily
but
we
get
used
to
it
in
time
i
guess
what
other
folks
can
do
we
can
an
a
mighty
lot
of
has
camped
out
it
all
right
here
we
are
free
an
independent
no
rent
to
pay
our
own
bosses
he
stopped
abruptly
from
somewhere
in
the
brush
came
an
intermittent
rustling
when
they
tried
to
locate
it
it
mysteriously
ceased
and
when
the
first
hint
of
drowsiness
stole
upon
them
the
rustling
as
mysteriously
recommenced
it
sounds
like
something
creeping
up
on
us
saxon
suggested
snuggling
closer
to
billy
well
it
ai
a
wild
indian
at
all
events
was
the
best
he
could
offer
in
the
way
of
comfort
he
yawned
deliberately
aw
shucks
there
to
be
scared
of
think
of
what
all
the
pioneers
went
several
minutes
later
his
shoulders
began
to
shake
and
saxon
knew
he
was
giggling
i
was
just
thinkin
of
a
yarn
my
father
used
to
tell
about
he
explained
it
was
about
old
susan
kleghorn
one
of
the
oregon
pioneer
women
susan
they
used
to
call
her
but
she
could
shoot
to
beat
the
band
once
on
the
plains
the
wagon
train
she
was
in
was
attacked
by
indians
they
got
all
the
wagons
in
a
circle
an
all
hands
an
the
oxen
inside
an
drove
the
indians
off
killin
a
lot
of
they
was
too
strong
that
way
so
what
the
indians
do
to
draw
out
into
the
open
but
take
two
white
girls
captured
from
some
other
train
an
begin
to
torture
they
done
it
just
out
of
gunshot
but
so
everybody
could
see
the
idea
was
that
the
white
men
could
stand
it
an
would
rush
out
an
then
the
indians
have
where
they
wanted
the
white
men
could
do
a
thing
if
they
rushed
out
to
save
the
girls
they
be
finished
an
then
the
indians
rush
the
train
it
meant
death
to
everybody
but
what
does
old
susan
do
but
get
out
an
old
kentucky
rifle
she
rams
down
about
three
times
the
regular
load
of
powder
takes
aim
at
a
big
buck
that
pretty
busy
at
the
torturin
an
bangs
away
it
knocked
her
clean
over
backward
her
shoulder
was
lame
all
the
rest
of
the
way
to
oregon
but
she
dropped
the
big
indian
deado
he
never
knew
what
struck
but
that
was
the
yarn
i
wanted
to
tell
it
seems
old
susan
liked
john
barleycorn
she
souse
herself
to
the
ears
every
chance
she
got
an
her
sons
an
daughters
an
the
old
man
had
to
be
mighty
careful
not
to
leave
any
around
where
she
could
get
hands
on
on
what
asked
saxon
on
john
oh
you
ai
on
to
that
it
the
old
fashioned
name
for
whisky
well
one
day
all
the
folks
was
goin
away
that
was
over
somewhere
at
a
place
called
bodega
where
they
settled
after
comin
down
from
oregon
an
old
susan
claimed
her
rheumatics
was
hurtin
her
an
so
she
could
go
but
the
family
was
on
there
was
a
demijohn
of
whisky
in
the
house
they
said
all
right
but
before
they
left
they
sent
one
of
the
grandsons
to
climb
a
big
tree
in
the
barnyard
where
he
tied
the
demijohn
sixty
feet
from
the
ground
just
the
same
when
they
come
home
that
night
they
found
susan
on
the
kitchen
floor
dead
to
the
and
she
climbed
the
tree
after
all
saxon
hazarded
when
billy
had
shown
no
inclination
of
going
on
not
on
your
life
he
laughed
jubilantly
all
she
done
was
to
put
a
washtub
on
the
ground
square
under
the
demijohn
then
she
got
out
her
old
rifle
an
shot
the
demijohn
to
smithereens
an
all
she
had
to
do
was
lap
the
whisky
outa
the
again
saxon
was
drowsing
when
the
rustling
sound
was
heard
this
time
closer
to
her
excited
apprehension
there
was
something
stealthy
about
it
and
she
imagined
a
beast
of
prey
creeping
upon
them
billy
she
whispered
yes
i
to
it
came
his
wide
awake
answer
might
that
be
a
panther
or
maybe
a
wildcat
it
ca
be
all
the
varmints
was
killed
off
long
ago
this
is
peaceable
farmin
a
vagrant
breeze
sighed
through
the
trees
and
made
saxon
shiver
the
mysterious
ceased
with
suspicious
abruptness
then
from
the
rustling
noise
ensued
a
dull
but
heavy
thump
that
caused
both
saxon
and
billy
to
sit
up
in
the
blankets
there
were
no
further
sounds
and
they
lay
down
again
though
the
very
silence
now
seemed
ominous
huh
billy
muttered
with
relief
as
though
i
do
know
what
it
was
it
was
a
rabbit
i
heard
tame
ones
bang
their
hind
feet
down
on
the
floor
that
in
vain
saxon
tried
to
win
sleep
the
sand
grew
harder
with
the
passage
of
time
her
flesh
and
her
bones
ached
from
contact
with
it
and
though
her
reason
flouted
any
possibility
of
wild
dangers
her
fancy
went
on
picturing
them
with
unflagging
zeal
a
new
sound
commenced
it
was
neither
a
rustling
nor
a
rattling
and
it
tokened
some
large
body
passing
through
the
brush
sometimes
twigs
crackled
and
broke
and
once
they
heard
press
aside
and
spring
back
into
place
if
that
other
thing
was
a
panther
this
is
an
elephant
was
uncheering
opinion
it
got
weight
listen
to
that
an
it
there
were
frequent
stoppages
then
the
sounds
would
begin
again
always
louder
always
closer
billy
sat
up
in
the
blankets
once
more
passing
one
arm
around
saxon
who
had
also
sat
up
i
ai
slept
a
wink
he
complained
there
it
goes
again
i
wish
i
could
it
makes
a
noise
big
enough
for
a
grizzly
saxon
chattered
partly
from
nervousness
partly
from
the
chill
of
the
night
it
ai
no
grasshopper
that
billy
started
to
leave
the
blankets
but
saxon
caught
his
arm
what
are
you
going
to
do
oh
i
ai
scairt
none
he
answered
but
honest
to
god
this
is
gettin
on
my
nerves
if
i
do
find
what
that
thing
is
it
give
me
the
willies
i
just
goin
to
reconnoiter
i
wo
go
so
intensely
dark
was
the
night
that
the
moment
billy
crawled
beyond
the
reach
of
her
hand
he
was
lost
to
sight
she
sat
and
waited
the
sound
had
ceased
though
she
could
follow
billy
progress
by
the
cracking
of
dry
twigs
and
limbs
after
a
few
moments
he
returned
and
crawled
under
the
blankets
i
scared
it
away
i
guess
it
got
better
ears
an
when
it
heard
me
comin
it
skinned
out
most
likely
i
did
my
dangdest
too
not
to
make
a
o
lord
there
it
goes
they
sat
up
saxon
nudged
billy
there
she
warned
in
the
faintest
of
whispers
i
can
hear
it
breathing
it
almost
made
a
a
dead
branch
cracked
loudly
and
so
near
at
hand
that
both
of
them
jumped
shamelessly
i
ai
goin
to
stand
any
more
of
its
foolin
billy
declared
wrathfully
it
be
on
top
of
us
if
i
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
queried
anxiously
yell
the
top
of
my
head
off
i
get
a
fall
outa
whatever
it
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
emitted
a
wild
yell
the
result
far
exceeded
any
expectation
he
could
have
entertained
and
saxon
heart
leaped
up
in
sheer
panic
on
the
instant
the
darkness
erupted
into
terrible
sound
and
movement
there
were
trashings
of
underbrush
and
lunges
and
plunges
of
heavy
bodies
in
different
directions
fortunately
for
their
ease
of
mind
all
these
sounds
receded
and
died
away
an
what
d
think
of
that
billy
broke
the
silence
gee
all
the
fight
fans
used
to
say
i
was
scairt
of
nothin
just
the
same
i
glad
they
ai
seein
me
he
groaned
i
got
all
i
want
of
that
blamed
sand
i
goin
to
get
up
and
start
the
this
was
easy
under
the
ashes
were
live
embers
which
quickly
ignited
the
wood
he
threw
on
a
few
stars
were
peeping
out
in
the
misty
zenith
he
looked
up
at
them
deliberated
and
started
to
move
away
where
are
you
going
now
saxon
called
oh
i
got
an
idea
he
replied
noncommittally
and
walked
boldly
away
beyond
the
circle
of
the
firelight
saxon
sat
with
the
blankets
drawn
closely
under
her
chin
and
admired
his
courage
he
had
not
even
taken
the
hatchet
and
he
was
going
in
the
direction
in
which
the
disturbance
had
died
away
ten
minutes
later
he
came
back
chuckling
the
they
got
my
goat
all
right
i
be
scairt
of
my
own
shadow
what
was
they
huh
you
could
guess
in
a
thousand
years
a
bunch
of
calves
an
they
was
worse
scairt
than
he
smoked
a
cigarette
by
the
fire
then
rejoined
saxon
under
the
blankets
a
hell
of
a
farmer
i
make
he
chafed
when
a
lot
of
little
calves
can
scare
the
stuffin
outa
me
i
bet
your
father
or
mine
an
eye
the
stock
has
gone
to
seed
that
what
it
no
it
has
saxon
defended
the
stock
is
all
right
we
just
as
able
as
our
folks
ever
were
and
we
healthier
on
top
of
it
been
brought
up
different
that
all
we
lived
in
cities
all
our
lives
we
know
the
city
sounds
and
thugs
but
we
do
know
the
country
ones
our
training
has
been
unnatural
that
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
now
we
going
in
for
natural
training
give
us
a
little
time
and
we
sleep
as
sound
out
of
doors
as
ever
your
father
or
mine
but
not
on
sand
billy
groaned
we
wo
try
that
one
thing
for
good
and
all
we
learned
the
very
first
time
and
now
hush
up
and
go
to
their
fears
had
vanished
but
the
sand
receiving
now
their
undivided
attention
multiplied
its
unyieldingness
billy
dozed
off
first
and
roosters
were
crowing
somewhere
in
the
distance
when
saxon
eyes
closed
but
they
could
not
escape
the
sand
and
their
sleep
was
fitful
at
the
first
gray
of
dawn
billy
crawled
out
and
built
a
roaring
fire
saxon
drew
up
to
it
shiveringly
they
were
and
weary
saxon
began
to
laugh
billy
joined
sulkily
then
brightened
up
as
his
eyes
chanced
upon
the
coffee
pot
which
he
immediately
put
on
to
boil
chapter
iii
it
is
forty
miles
from
oakland
to
san
jose
and
saxon
and
billy
accomplished
it
in
three
easy
days
no
more
obliging
and
angrily
garrulous
linemen
were
encountered
and
few
were
the
opportunities
for
conversation
with
chance
wayfarers
numbers
of
tramps
carrying
rolls
of
blankets
were
met
traveling
both
north
and
south
on
the
county
road
and
from
talks
with
them
saxon
quickly
learned
that
they
knew
little
or
nothing
about
farming
they
were
mostly
old
men
feeble
or
besotted
and
all
they
knew
was
work
where
jobs
might
be
good
where
jobs
had
been
good
but
the
places
they
mentioned
were
always
a
long
way
off
one
thing
she
did
glean
from
them
and
that
was
that
the
district
she
and
billy
were
passing
through
was
country
in
which
labor
was
rarely
hired
and
that
when
it
was
it
generally
was
portuguese
the
farmers
themselves
were
unfriendly
they
drove
by
billy
and
saxon
often
with
empty
wagons
but
never
invited
them
to
ride
when
chance
offered
and
saxon
did
ask
questions
they
looked
her
over
curiously
or
suspiciously
and
gave
ambiguous
and
facetious
answers
they
ai
americans
damn
them
billy
fretted
why
in
the
old
days
everybody
was
friendly
to
but
saxon
remembered
her
last
talk
with
her
brother
it
the
spirit
of
the
times
billy
the
spirit
has
changed
besides
these
people
are
too
near
wait
till
we
get
farther
away
from
the
cities
then
we
find
them
more
a
measly
lot
these
ones
are
he
sneered
maybe
they
a
right
to
be
she
laughed
for
all
you
know
more
than
one
of
the
scabs
you
slugged
were
sons
of
if
i
could
only
hope
so
billy
said
fervently
but
i
do
care
if
i
owned
ten
thousand
acres
any
man
hikin
with
his
blankets
might
be
just
as
good
a
man
as
me
an
maybe
better
for
all
i
know
i
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
billy
asked
for
work
at
first
indiscriminately
later
only
at
the
larger
farms
the
unvarying
reply
was
that
there
was
no
work
a
few
said
there
would
be
plowing
after
the
first
rains
here
and
there
in
a
small
way
dry
plowing
was
going
on
but
in
the
main
the
farmers
were
waiting
but
do
you
know
how
to
plow
saxon
asked
billy
no
but
i
guess
it
ai
much
of
a
trick
to
turn
besides
next
man
i
see
plowing
i
goin
to
get
a
lesson
in
the
of
the
second
day
his
opportunity
came
he
climbed
on
top
of
the
fence
of
a
small
field
and
watched
an
old
man
plow
round
and
round
it
aw
shucks
just
as
easy
as
easy
billy
commented
scornfully
if
an
old
codger
like
that
can
handle
one
plow
i
can
handle
go
on
and
try
it
saxon
urged
what
the
good
cold
feet
she
jeered
but
with
a
smiling
face
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
him
all
he
can
do
is
say
no
and
what
if
he
does
you
faced
the
chicago
terror
twenty
rounds
without
aw
but
it
different
he
demurred
then
dropped
to
the
ground
inside
the
fence
two
to
one
the
old
geezer
turns
me
no
he
wo
just
tell
him
you
want
to
learn
and
ask
him
if
he
let
you
drive
around
a
few
times
tell
him
it
wo
cost
him
huh
if
he
gets
chesty
i
take
his
blamed
plow
away
from
from
the
top
of
the
fence
but
too
far
away
to
hear
saxon
watched
the
colloquy
after
several
minutes
the
lines
were
transferred
to
neck
the
handles
to
his
hands
then
the
team
started
and
the
old
man
delivering
a
rapid
fire
of
instructions
walked
alongside
of
billy
when
a
few
turns
had
been
made
the
farmer
crossed
the
plowed
strip
to
saxon
and
joined
her
on
the
rail
he
plowed
before
a
little
mite
ai
he
saxon
shook
her
head
never
in
his
life
but
he
knows
how
to
drive
he
showed
he
was
all
greenhorn
an
he
learns
pretty
here
the
farmer
chuckled
and
cut
himself
a
chew
from
a
plug
of
tobacco
i
reckon
he
wo
tire
me
out
the
unplowed
area
grew
smaller
and
smaller
but
billy
evinced
no
intention
of
quitting
and
his
audience
on
the
fence
was
deep
in
conversation
saxon
questions
flew
fast
and
furious
and
she
was
not
long
in
concluding
that
the
old
man
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
description
the
lineman
had
given
of
his
father
billy
persisted
till
the
field
was
finished
and
the
old
man
invited
him
and
saxon
to
stop
for
the
night
there
was
a
disused
outbuilding
where
they
would
find
a
small
cook
stove
he
said
and
also
he
would
give
them
fresh
milk
further
if
saxon
wanted
to
test
her
desire
for
farming
she
could
try
her
hand
on
the
cow
the
milking
lesson
did
not
prove
as
successful
as
billy
plowing
but
when
he
had
mocked
sufficiently
saxon
challenged
him
to
try
and
he
failed
as
grievously
as
she
saxon
had
eyes
and
questions
for
everything
and
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
realize
that
she
was
looking
upon
the
other
side
of
the
farming
shield
farm
and
farmer
were
there
was
no
intensive
cultivation
there
was
too
much
land
too
little
farmed
everything
was
slipshod
house
and
barn
and
outbuildings
were
fast
falling
into
ruin
the
front
yard
was
there
was
no
vegetable
garden
the
small
orchard
was
old
sickly
and
neglected
the
trees
were
twisted
spindling
and
overgrown
with
a
gray
moss
the
sons
and
daughters
were
away
in
the
cities
saxon
found
out
one
daughter
had
married
a
doctor
the
other
was
a
teacher
in
the
state
normal
school
one
son
was
a
locomotive
engineer
the
second
was
an
architect
and
the
third
was
a
police
court
reporter
in
san
francisco
on
occasion
the
father
said
they
helped
out
the
old
folks
what
do
you
think
saxon
asked
billy
as
he
smoked
his
cigarette
his
shoulders
went
up
in
a
comprehensive
shrug
huh
that
easy
the
old
geezer
like
his
orchard
covered
with
moss
it
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
after
san
leandro
that
he
know
the
first
thing
an
them
horses
it
be
a
charity
to
him
an
a
savin
of
money
for
him
to
take
out
an
shoot
both
you
bet
you
do
see
the
porchugeeze
with
horses
like
them
an
it
ai
a
case
of
bein
proud
or
puttin
on
side
to
have
good
horses
it
brass
tacks
an
business
it
pays
that
the
game
old
horses
eat
more
young
ones
to
keep
in
condition
an
they
ca
do
the
same
amount
of
work
but
you
bet
it
costs
just
as
much
to
shoe
them
an
his
is
scrub
on
top
of
it
every
minute
he
has
them
horses
he
losin
money
you
oughta
see
the
way
they
work
an
figure
horses
in
the
they
slept
soundly
and
after
an
early
breakfast
prepared
to
start
i
like
to
give
you
a
couple
of
days
work
the
old
man
regretted
at
parting
but
i
ca
see
it
the
ranch
just
about
keeps
me
and
the
old
woman
now
that
the
children
are
gone
an
then
it
do
always
seems
times
have
been
bad
for
a
long
spell
now
ai
never
been
the
same
since
grover
early
in
the
afternoon
on
the
outskirts
of
san
jose
saxon
called
a
halt
i
going
right
in
there
and
talk
she
declared
unless
they
set
the
dogs
on
me
that
the
prettiest
place
yet
is
it
billy
who
was
always
visioning
hills
and
spacious
ranges
for
his
horses
mumbled
unenthusiastic
assent
and
the
vegetables
look
at
them
and
the
flowers
growing
along
the
borders
that
beats
tomato
plants
in
wrapping
do
see
the
sense
of
it
billy
objected
where
the
money
come
in
from
flowers
that
take
up
the
ground
that
good
vegetables
might
be
growin
on
and
that
what
i
going
to
find
she
pointed
to
a
woman
stooped
to
the
ground
and
working
with
a
trowel
in
front
of
the
tiny
bungalow
i
do
know
what
she
like
but
at
the
worst
she
can
only
be
mean
see
she
looking
at
us
now
drop
your
load
alongside
of
mine
and
come
on
billy
slung
the
blankets
from
his
shoulder
to
the
ground
but
elected
to
wait
as
saxon
went
up
the
narrow
walk
she
noted
two
men
at
work
among
the
vegetables
one
an
old
chinese
the
other
old
and
of
some
foreign
breed
here
were
neatness
efficiency
and
intensive
cultivation
with
a
vengeance
even
her
untrained
eye
could
see
that
the
woman
stood
up
and
turned
from
her
flowers
and
saxon
saw
that
she
was
slender
and
simply
but
nicely
dressed
she
wore
glasses
and
saxon
reading
of
her
face
was
that
it
was
kind
but
nervous
looking
i
do
want
anything
she
said
before
saxon
could
speak
administering
the
rebuff
with
a
pleasant
smile
saxon
groaned
inwardly
over
the
telescope
basket
evidently
the
woman
had
seen
her
put
it
down
we
not
peddling
she
explained
quickly
oh
i
am
sorry
for
the
this
time
the
woman
smile
was
even
pleasanter
and
she
waited
for
saxon
to
state
her
errand
nothing
loath
saxon
took
it
at
a
plunge
we
looking
for
land
we
want
to
be
farmers
you
know
and
before
we
get
the
land
we
want
to
find
out
what
kind
of
land
we
want
and
seeing
your
pretty
place
has
just
filled
me
up
with
questions
you
see
we
do
know
anything
about
farming
we
lived
in
the
city
all
our
life
and
now
we
given
it
up
and
are
going
to
live
in
the
country
and
be
she
paused
the
woman
face
seemed
to
grow
quizzical
though
the
pleasantness
did
not
abate
but
how
do
you
know
you
will
be
happy
in
the
country
she
asked
i
do
know
all
i
do
know
is
that
poor
people
ca
be
happy
in
the
city
where
they
have
labor
troubles
all
the
time
if
they
ca
be
happy
in
the
country
then
there
no
happiness
anywhere
and
that
seem
fair
does
it
it
is
sound
reasoning
my
dear
as
far
as
it
goes
but
you
must
remember
that
there
are
many
poor
people
in
the
country
and
many
unhappy
you
look
neither
poor
nor
unhappy
saxon
challenged
you
are
a
saxon
saw
the
pleased
flush
in
the
other
face
which
lingered
as
she
went
on
but
still
i
may
be
peculiarly
qualified
to
live
and
succeed
in
the
country
as
you
say
yourself
you
spent
your
life
in
the
city
you
do
know
the
first
thing
about
the
country
it
might
even
break
your
saxon
mind
went
back
to
the
terrible
months
in
the
pine
street
cottage
i
know
already
that
the
city
will
break
my
heart
maybe
the
country
will
too
but
just
the
same
it
my
only
chance
do
you
see
that
or
nothing
besides
our
folks
before
us
were
all
of
the
country
it
seems
the
more
natural
way
and
better
here
i
am
which
proves
that
down
inside
i
must
want
the
country
must
as
you
call
it
be
peculiarly
qualified
for
the
country
or
else
i
would
be
the
other
nodded
approval
and
looked
at
her
with
growing
interest
that
young
man
she
began
is
my
husband
he
was
a
teamster
until
the
big
strike
came
my
name
is
roberts
saxon
roberts
and
my
husband
is
william
and
i
am
mortimer
the
other
said
with
a
bow
of
acknowledgment
i
am
a
widow
and
now
if
you
will
ask
your
husband
in
i
shall
try
to
answer
some
of
your
many
questions
tell
him
to
put
the
bundles
inside
the
and
now
what
are
all
the
questions
you
are
filled
with
oh
all
kinds
how
does
it
pay
how
did
you
manage
it
all
how
much
did
the
land
cost
did
you
build
that
beautiful
house
how
much
do
you
pay
the
men
how
did
you
learn
all
the
different
kinds
of
things
and
which
grew
best
and
which
paid
best
what
is
the
best
way
to
sell
them
how
do
you
sell
them
saxon
paused
and
laughed
oh
i
have
begun
yet
why
do
you
have
flowers
on
the
borders
everywhere
i
looked
over
the
portuguese
farms
around
san
leandro
but
they
never
mixed
flowers
and
mortimer
held
up
her
hand
let
me
answer
the
last
first
it
is
the
key
to
almost
but
billy
arrived
and
the
explanation
was
deferred
until
after
his
introduction
the
flowers
caught
your
eyes
did
they
my
dear
mortimer
resumed
and
brought
you
in
through
my
gate
and
right
up
to
me
and
that
the
very
reason
they
were
planted
with
the
vegetables
to
catch
eyes
you
ca
imagine
how
many
eyes
they
have
caught
nor
how
many
owners
of
eyes
they
have
lured
inside
my
gate
this
is
a
good
road
and
is
a
very
popular
short
country
drive
for
townsfolk
oh
no
i
never
had
any
luck
with
automobiles
they
ca
see
anything
for
dust
but
i
began
when
nearly
everybody
still
used
carriages
the
townswomen
would
drive
by
my
flowers
and
then
my
place
would
catch
their
eyes
they
would
tell
their
drivers
to
stop
and
well
somehow
i
managed
to
be
in
the
front
within
speaking
distance
usually
i
succeeded
in
inviting
them
in
to
see
my
flowers
and
vegetables
of
course
everything
was
sweet
clean
pretty
it
all
appealed
and
mortimer
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
is
well
known
that
the
stomach
sees
through
the
eyes
the
thought
of
vegetables
growing
among
flowers
pleased
their
fancy
they
wanted
my
vegetables
they
must
have
them
and
they
did
at
double
the
market
price
which
they
were
only
too
glad
to
pay
you
see
i
became
the
fashion
or
a
fad
in
a
small
way
nobody
lost
the
vegetables
were
certainly
good
as
good
as
any
on
the
market
and
often
fresher
and
besides
my
customers
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
for
they
were
pleased
with
themselves
for
philanthropic
reasons
not
only
did
they
obtain
the
finest
and
freshest
possible
vegetables
but
at
the
same
time
they
were
happy
with
the
knowledge
that
they
were
helping
a
deserving
yes
and
it
gave
a
certain
tone
to
their
establishments
to
be
able
to
say
they
bought
mortimer
vegetables
but
too
big
a
side
to
go
into
in
short
my
little
place
became
a
show
place
anywhere
to
go
for
a
drive
or
anything
you
know
when
time
has
to
be
killed
and
it
became
noised
about
who
i
was
and
who
my
husband
had
been
what
i
had
been
some
of
the
townsladies
i
had
known
personally
in
the
old
days
they
actually
worked
for
my
success
and
then
too
i
used
to
serve
tea
my
patrons
became
my
guests
for
the
time
being
i
still
serve
it
when
they
drive
out
to
show
me
off
to
their
friends
so
you
see
the
flowers
are
one
of
the
ways
i
saxon
was
glowing
with
appreciation
but
mortimer
glancing
at
billy
noted
not
entire
approval
his
blue
eyes
were
clouded
well
out
with
it
she
encouraged
what
are
you
thinking
to
saxon
surprise
he
answered
directly
and
to
her
double
surprise
his
criticism
was
of
a
nature
which
had
never
entered
her
head
it
just
a
trick
billy
expounded
that
what
i
was
gettin
at
but
a
paying
trick
mortimer
interrupted
her
eyes
dancing
and
vivacious
behind
the
glasses
yes
and
no
billy
said
stubbornly
speaking
in
his
slow
deliberate
fashion
if
every
farmer
was
to
mix
flowers
an
vegetables
then
every
farmer
would
get
double
the
market
price
an
then
there
would
be
any
double
market
price
everything
be
as
it
was
you
are
opposing
a
theory
to
a
fact
mortimer
stated
the
fact
is
that
all
the
farmers
do
not
do
it
the
fact
is
that
i
do
receive
double
the
price
you
ca
get
away
from
billy
was
unconvinced
though
unable
to
reply
just
the
same
he
muttered
with
a
slow
shake
of
the
head
i
do
get
the
hang
of
it
there
something
wrong
so
far
as
concerned
my
wife
an
me
i
mean
maybe
i
get
hold
of
it
after
a
and
in
the
meantime
we
look
around
mortimer
invited
i
want
to
show
you
everything
and
tell
you
how
i
make
it
go
afterward
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
about
the
beginning
you
see
she
bent
her
gaze
on
saxon
i
want
you
thoroughly
to
understand
that
you
can
succeed
in
the
country
if
you
go
about
it
right
i
did
know
a
thing
about
it
when
i
began
and
i
did
have
a
fine
big
man
like
yours
i
was
all
alone
but
i
tell
you
about
for
the
next
hour
among
vegetables
and
fruit
trees
saxon
stored
her
brain
with
a
huge
mass
of
information
to
be
digested
at
her
leisure
billy
too
was
interested
but
he
left
the
talking
to
saxon
himself
rarely
asking
a
question
at
the
rear
of
the
bungalow
where
everything
was
as
clean
and
orderly
as
the
front
they
were
shown
through
the
chicken
yard
here
in
different
runs
were
kept
several
hundred
small
and
hens
white
leghorns
said
mortimer
you
have
no
idea
what
they
netted
me
this
year
i
never
keep
a
hen
a
moment
past
the
prime
of
her
laying
period
just
what
i
was
tellin
you
saxon
about
horses
billy
broke
in
and
by
the
simplest
method
of
hatching
them
at
the
right
time
which
not
one
farmer
in
ten
thousand
ever
dreams
of
doing
i
have
them
laying
in
the
winter
when
most
hens
stop
laying
and
when
eggs
are
highest
another
thing
i
have
my
special
customers
they
pay
me
ten
cents
a
dozen
more
than
the
market
price
because
my
specialty
is
here
she
chanced
to
glance
at
billy
and
guessed
that
he
was
still
wrestling
with
his
problem
same
old
thing
she
queried
he
nodded
same
old
thing
if
every
farmer
delivered
eggs
there
would
be
no
ten
cents
higher
the
top
price
they
be
no
better
off
than
they
was
but
the
eggs
would
be
eggs
all
the
eggs
would
be
eggs
you
must
forget
that
mortimer
pointed
out
but
that
do
butter
no
toast
for
my
wife
an
me
he
objected
that
what
i
been
tryin
to
get
the
hang
of
an
now
i
got
it
you
talk
about
theory
an
fact
ten
cents
higher
than
top
price
is
a
theory
to
saxon
an
me
the
fact
is
we
ai
got
no
eggs
no
chickens
an
no
land
for
the
chickens
to
run
an
lay
eggs
their
hostess
nodded
sympathetically
an
there
something
else
about
this
outfit
of
yourn
that
i
do
get
the
hang
of
he
pursued
i
ca
just
put
my
finger
on
it
but
there
all
they
were
shown
over
the
cattery
the
piggery
the
milkers
and
the
kennelry
as
mortimer
called
her
live
stock
departments
none
was
large
all
were
moneymakers
she
assured
them
and
rattled
off
her
profits
glibly
she
took
their
breaths
away
by
the
prices
given
and
received
for
pedigreed
persians
pedigreed
ohio
improved
chesters
pedigreed
scotch
collies
and
pedigreed
jerseys
for
the
milk
of
the
last
she
also
had
a
special
private
market
receiving
five
cents
more
a
quart
than
was
fetched
by
the
best
dairy
milk
billy
was
quick
to
point
out
the
difference
between
the
look
of
her
orchard
and
the
look
of
the
orchard
they
had
inspected
the
previous
afternoon
and
mortimer
showed
him
scores
of
other
differences
many
of
which
he
was
compelled
to
accept
on
faith
then
she
told
them
of
another
industry
her
jams
and
jellies
always
contracted
for
in
advance
and
at
prices
dizzyingly
beyond
the
regular
market
they
sat
in
comfortable
rattan
chairs
on
the
veranda
while
she
told
the
story
of
how
she
had
drummed
up
the
jam
and
jelly
trade
dealing
only
with
the
one
best
restaurant
and
one
best
club
in
san
jose
to
the
proprietor
and
the
steward
she
had
gone
with
her
samples
in
long
discussions
beaten
down
their
opposition
overcome
their
reluctance
and
persuaded
the
proprietor
in
particular
to
make
a
special
of
her
wares
to
boom
them
quietly
with
his
patrons
and
above
all
to
charge
stiffly
for
dishes
and
courses
in
which
they
appeared
throughout
the
recital
billy
eyes
were
moody
with
dissatisfaction
mortimer
saw
and
waited
and
now
begin
at
the
beginning
saxon
begged
but
mortimer
refused
unless
they
agreed
to
stop
for
supper
saxon
frowned
billy
reluctance
away
and
accepted
for
both
of
them
well
then
mortimer
took
up
her
tale
in
the
beginning
i
was
a
greenhorn
city
born
and
bred
all
i
knew
of
the
country
was
that
it
was
a
place
to
go
to
for
vacations
and
i
always
went
to
springs
and
mountain
and
seaside
resorts
i
had
lived
among
books
almost
all
my
life
i
was
head
librarian
of
the
doncaster
library
for
years
then
i
married
mortimer
he
was
a
book
man
a
professor
in
san
miguel
university
he
had
a
long
sickness
and
when
he
died
there
was
nothing
left
even
his
life
insurance
was
eaten
into
before
i
could
be
free
of
creditors
as
for
myself
i
was
worn
out
on
the
verge
of
nervous
prostration
fit
for
nothing
i
had
five
thousand
dollars
left
however
and
without
going
into
the
details
i
decided
to
go
farming
i
found
this
place
in
a
delightful
climate
close
to
san
jose
the
end
of
the
electric
line
is
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
and
i
bought
it
i
paid
two
thousand
cash
and
gave
a
mortgage
for
two
thousand
it
cost
two
hundred
an
acre
you
twenty
acres
saxon
cried
was
that
pretty
small
billy
ventured
too
large
oceans
too
large
i
leased
ten
acres
of
it
the
first
thing
and
it
still
leased
after
all
this
time
even
the
ten
i
retained
was
much
too
large
for
a
long
long
time
it
only
now
that
i
beginning
to
feel
a
tiny
mite
and
ten
acres
has
supported
you
an
two
hired
men
billy
demanded
amazed
mortimer
clapped
her
hands
delightedly
listen
i
had
been
a
librarian
i
knew
my
way
among
books
first
of
all
i
read
everything
written
on
the
subject
and
subscribed
to
some
of
the
best
farm
magazines
and
papers
and
you
ask
if
my
ten
acres
have
supported
me
and
two
hired
men
let
me
tell
you
i
have
four
hired
men
the
ten
acres
certainly
must
support
them
as
it
supports
hannah
a
swedish
widow
who
runs
the
house
and
who
is
a
perfect
trojan
during
the
jam
and
jelly
season
and
hannah
daughter
who
goes
to
school
and
lends
a
hand
and
my
nephew
whom
i
have
taken
to
raise
and
educate
also
the
ten
acres
have
come
pretty
close
to
paying
for
the
whole
twenty
as
well
as
for
this
house
and
all
the
outbuildings
and
all
the
pedigreed
saxon
remembered
what
the
young
lineman
had
said
about
the
portuguese
the
ten
acres
did
do
a
bit
of
it
she
cried
it
was
your
head
that
did
it
all
and
you
know
and
that
the
point
my
dear
it
shows
the
right
kind
of
person
can
succeed
in
the
country
remember
the
soil
is
generous
but
it
must
be
treated
generously
and
that
is
something
the
old
style
american
farmer
ca
get
into
his
head
so
it
is
head
that
counts
even
when
his
starving
acres
have
convinced
him
of
the
need
for
fertilizing
he
see
the
difference
between
cheap
fertilizer
and
good
and
that
something
i
want
to
know
about
saxon
exclaimed
and
tell
you
all
i
know
but
first
you
must
be
very
tired
i
noticed
you
were
limping
let
me
take
you
in
never
mind
your
bundles
i
send
chang
for
to
saxon
with
her
innate
love
of
beauty
and
charm
in
all
personal
things
the
interior
of
the
bungalow
was
a
revelation
never
before
had
she
been
inside
a
middle
class
home
and
what
she
saw
not
only
far
exceeded
anything
she
had
imagined
but
was
vastly
different
from
her
imaginings
mortimer
noted
her
sparkling
glances
which
took
in
everything
and
went
out
of
her
way
to
show
saxon
around
doing
it
under
the
guise
of
gleeful
boastings
stating
the
costs
of
the
different
materials
explaining
how
she
had
done
things
with
her
own
hands
such
as
staining
the
doors
weathering
the
bookcases
and
putting
together
the
big
mission
morris
chair
billy
stepped
gingerly
behind
and
though
it
never
entered
his
mind
to
ape
to
the
manner
born
he
succeeded
in
escaping
conspicuous
awkwardness
even
at
the
table
where
he
and
saxon
had
the
unique
experience
of
being
waited
on
in
a
private
house
by
a
servant
if
you
only
come
along
next
year
mortimer
mourned
then
i
should
have
had
the
spare
room
i
had
planned
that
all
right
billy
spoke
up
thank
you
just
the
same
but
catch
the
electric
cars
into
san
jose
an
get
a
mortimer
was
still
disturbed
at
her
inability
to
put
them
up
for
the
night
and
saxon
changed
the
conversation
by
pleading
to
be
told
more
you
remember
i
told
you
i
paid
only
two
thousand
down
on
the
land
mortimer
complied
that
left
me
three
thousand
to
experiment
with
of
course
all
my
friends
and
relatives
prophesied
failure
and
of
course
i
made
my
mistakes
plenty
of
them
but
i
was
saved
from
still
more
by
the
thorough
study
i
had
made
and
continued
to
she
indicated
shelves
of
farm
books
and
files
of
farm
magazines
that
lined
the
walls
and
i
continued
to
study
i
was
resolved
to
be
up
to
date
and
i
sent
for
all
the
experiment
station
reports
i
went
almost
entirely
on
the
basis
that
whatever
the
old
type
farmer
did
was
wrong
and
do
you
know
in
doing
that
i
was
not
so
far
wrong
myself
almost
unthinkable
the
stupidity
of
the
farmers
oh
i
consulted
with
them
talked
things
over
with
them
challenged
their
stereotyped
ways
demanded
demonstration
of
their
dogmatic
and
prejudiced
beliefs
and
quite
succeeded
in
convincing
the
last
of
them
that
i
was
a
fool
and
doomed
to
come
to
but
you
did
you
did
mortimer
smiled
gratefully
sometimes
even
now
i
amazed
that
i
did
but
i
came
of
a
stock
which
had
been
away
from
the
soil
long
enough
to
gain
a
new
perspective
when
a
thing
satisfied
my
judgment
i
did
it
forthwith
and
downright
no
matter
how
extravagant
it
seemed
take
the
old
orchard
worthless
worse
than
worthless
old
calkins
nearly
died
of
heart
disease
when
he
saw
the
devastation
i
had
wreaked
upon
it
and
look
at
it
now
there
was
an
old
rattletrap
ruin
where
the
bungalow
now
stands
i
put
up
with
it
but
i
immediately
pulled
down
the
cow
barn
the
pigsties
the
chicken
houses
everything
made
a
clean
sweep
they
shook
their
heads
and
groaned
when
they
saw
such
wanton
waste
by
a
widow
struggling
to
make
a
living
but
worse
was
to
come
they
were
paralyzed
when
i
told
them
the
price
of
the
three
beautiful
pigs
you
know
chesters
which
i
bought
sixty
dollars
for
the
three
and
only
just
weaned
then
i
hustled
the
nondescript
chickens
to
market
replacing
them
with
the
white
leghorns
the
two
scrub
cows
that
came
with
the
place
i
sold
to
the
butcher
for
thirty
dollars
each
paying
two
hundred
and
fifty
for
two
jersey
heifers
and
coined
money
on
the
exchange
while
calkins
and
the
rest
went
right
on
with
their
scrubs
that
could
give
enough
milk
to
pay
for
their
billy
nodded
approval
remember
what
i
told
you
about
horses
he
reiterated
to
saxon
and
assisted
by
his
hostess
he
gave
a
very
creditable
disquisition
on
horseflesh
and
its
management
from
a
business
point
of
view
when
he
went
out
to
smoke
mortimer
led
saxon
into
talking
about
herself
and
billy
and
betrayed
not
the
slightest
shock
when
she
learned
of
his
prizefighting
and
proclivities
he
a
splendid
young
man
and
good
she
assured
saxon
his
face
shows
that
and
best
of
all
he
loves
you
and
is
proud
of
you
you
ca
imagine
how
i
have
enjoyed
watching
the
way
he
looks
at
you
especially
when
you
are
talking
he
respects
your
judgment
why
he
must
for
here
he
is
with
you
on
this
pilgrimage
which
is
wholly
your
mortimer
sighed
you
are
very
fortunate
dear
child
very
fortunate
and
you
do
yet
know
what
a
man
brain
is
wait
till
he
is
quite
fired
with
enthusiasm
for
your
project
you
will
be
astounded
by
the
way
he
takes
hold
you
will
have
to
exert
yourself
to
keep
up
with
him
in
the
meantime
you
must
lead
remember
he
is
city
bred
it
will
be
a
struggle
to
wean
him
from
the
only
life
he
oh
but
he
disgusted
with
the
city
too
saxon
began
but
not
as
you
are
love
is
not
the
whole
of
man
as
it
is
of
woman
the
city
hurt
you
more
than
it
hurt
him
it
was
you
who
lost
the
dear
little
babe
his
interest
his
connection
was
no
more
than
casual
and
incidental
compared
with
the
depth
and
vividness
of
mortimer
turned
her
head
to
billy
who
was
just
entering
have
you
got
the
hang
of
what
was
bothering
you
she
asked
pretty
close
to
it
he
answered
taking
the
indicated
big
morris
chair
it
this
one
moment
mortimer
checked
him
that
is
a
beautiful
big
strong
chair
and
so
are
you
at
any
rate
big
and
strong
and
your
little
wife
is
very
weary
no
no
sit
down
it
your
strength
she
needs
yes
i
insist
open
your
and
to
him
she
led
saxon
and
into
his
arms
placed
her
now
sir
and
you
look
delicious
the
pair
of
you
register
your
objections
to
my
way
of
earning
a
it
ai
your
way
billy
repudiated
quickly
your
way
all
right
it
great
what
i
trying
to
get
at
is
that
your
way
do
fit
us
we
could
make
a
go
of
it
your
way
why
you
had
pull
acquaintances
people
that
knew
you
been
a
librarian
an
your
husband
a
professor
an
you
had
here
he
floundered
a
moment
seeking
definiteness
for
the
idea
he
still
vaguely
grasped
well
you
had
a
way
we
could
have
you
were
educated
an
an
i
do
know
i
guess
you
knew
society
ways
an
business
ways
we
could
but
my
dear
boy
you
could
learn
what
was
necessary
she
contended
billy
shook
his
head
no
you
do
quite
get
me
let
take
it
this
way
just
suppose
me
with
jam
an
jelly
into
that
swell
restaurant
like
you
did
to
talk
with
the
top
guy
why
i
be
outa
place
the
moment
i
stepped
into
his
office
that
i
feel
outa
place
that
make
me
have
a
chip
on
my
shoulder
an
lookin
for
trouble
which
is
a
poor
way
to
do
business
then
too
i
be
thinkin
he
was
thinkin
i
was
a
whole
lot
of
a
husky
to
be
peddlin
jam
what
happen
i
be
chesty
at
the
drop
of
the
hat
i
be
thinkin
he
was
thinkin
i
was
standin
on
my
foot
an
i
beat
him
to
it
in
tellin
him
he
was
standin
on
his
foot
you
see
it
because
i
was
raised
that
way
it
be
take
it
or
leave
it
with
me
an
no
jam
what
you
say
is
true
mortimer
took
up
brightly
but
there
is
your
wife
just
look
at
her
she
make
an
impression
on
any
business
man
he
be
only
too
willing
to
listen
to
billy
stiffened
a
forbidding
expression
springing
into
his
eyes
what
have
i
done
now
their
hostess
laughed
i
ai
got
around
yet
to
tradin
on
my
wife
looks
he
rumbled
gruffly
right
you
are
the
only
trouble
is
that
you
both
of
you
are
fifty
years
behind
the
times
you
old
american
how
you
ever
got
here
in
the
thick
of
modern
conditions
is
a
miracle
you
rip
van
winkles
who
ever
heard
in
these
degenerate
times
of
a
young
man
and
woman
of
the
city
putting
their
blankets
on
their
backs
and
starting
out
in
search
of
land
why
it
the
old
argonaut
spirit
you
as
like
as
peas
in
a
pod
to
those
who
yoked
their
oxen
and
held
west
to
the
lands
beyond
the
sunset
i
wager
your
fathers
and
mothers
or
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
were
that
very
saxon
eyes
were
glistening
and
billy
were
friendly
once
more
both
nodded
their
heads
i
of
the
old
stock
myself
mortimer
went
on
proudly
my
grandmother
was
one
of
the
survivors
of
the
donner
party
my
grandfather
jason
whitney
came
around
the
horn
and
took
part
in
the
raising
of
the
bear
flag
at
sonoma
he
was
at
monterey
when
john
marshall
discovered
gold
in
sutter
one
of
the
streets
in
san
francisco
is
named
after
i
know
it
billy
put
in
whitney
street
it
near
russian
hill
saxon
mother
walked
across
the
and
billy
grandfather
and
grandmother
were
massacred
by
the
indians
saxon
contributed
his
father
was
a
little
baby
boy
and
lived
with
the
indians
until
captured
by
the
whites
he
did
even
know
his
name
and
was
adopted
by
a
why
you
two
dear
children
we
almost
like
relatives
mortimer
beamed
it
a
breath
of
old
times
alas
all
forgotten
in
these
days
i
am
especially
interested
because
i
catalogued
and
read
everything
covering
those
times
you
she
indicated
billy
you
are
historical
or
at
least
your
father
is
i
remember
about
him
the
whole
thing
is
in
bancroft
history
it
was
the
modoc
indians
there
were
eighteen
wagons
your
father
was
the
only
survivor
a
mere
baby
at
the
time
with
no
knowledge
of
what
happened
he
was
adopted
by
the
leader
of
the
that
right
said
billy
it
was
the
modocs
his
train
must
have
ben
bound
for
oregon
it
was
all
wiped
out
i
wonder
if
you
know
anything
about
saxon
mother
she
used
to
write
poetry
in
the
early
was
any
of
it
printed
yes
saxon
answered
in
the
old
san
jose
and
do
you
know
any
of
it
yes
there
one
beginning
as
the
airy
strains
your
gentle
muse
has
learned
to
sing
and
california
boundless
plains
prolong
the
soft
notes
echoing
it
sounds
familiar
mortimer
said
pondering
and
there
was
another
i
remember
that
began
stolen
away
from
the
crowd
in
the
groves
where
the
nude
statues
stand
and
the
leaves
point
and
shiver
and
it
run
on
like
that
i
do
understand
it
all
it
was
written
to
my
father
a
love
poem
mortimer
broke
in
i
remember
it
wait
a
minute
stands
the
spray
of
a
fountain
whose
tremble
lightly
a
moment
on
bosom
and
hands
then
drip
in
their
basin
from
bosom
and
wrists
i
never
forgotten
the
drip
of
the
though
i
remember
your
mother
it
was
daisy
saxon
began
no
dayelle
mortimer
corrected
with
quickening
recollection
oh
but
nobody
called
her
but
she
signed
it
that
way
what
is
the
rest
daisy
wiley
mortimer
went
to
the
bookshelves
and
quickly
returned
with
a
large
volume
it
story
of
the
files
she
explained
among
other
things
all
the
good
fugitive
verse
was
gathered
here
from
the
old
newspaper
her
eyes
running
down
the
index
suddenly
stopped
i
was
right
dayelle
wiley
brown
there
it
is
ten
of
her
poems
too
viking
quest
of
gold
caballero
at
little
meadow
we
fought
off
the
indians
there
saxon
interrupted
in
her
excitement
and
mother
who
was
only
a
little
girl
went
out
and
got
water
for
the
wounded
and
the
indians
would
shoot
at
her
everybody
said
it
was
a
she
sprang
out
of
billy
arms
reaching
for
the
book
and
crying
oh
let
me
see
it
let
me
see
it
it
all
new
to
me
i
know
these
poems
can
i
copy
them
i
learn
them
by
heart
just
to
think
my
mother
mortimer
glasses
required
repolishing
and
for
half
an
hour
she
and
billy
remained
silent
while
saxon
devoured
her
mother
lines
at
the
end
staring
at
the
book
which
she
had
closed
on
her
finger
she
could
only
repeat
in
wondering
awe
and
i
never
knew
i
never
but
during
that
half
hour
mortimer
mind
had
not
been
idle
a
little
later
she
broached
her
plan
she
believed
in
intensive
dairying
as
well
as
intensive
farming
and
intended
as
soon
as
the
lease
expired
to
establish
a
jersey
dairy
on
the
other
ten
acres
this
like
everything
she
had
done
would
be
model
and
it
meant
that
she
would
require
more
help
billy
and
saxon
were
just
the
two
by
next
summer
she
could
have
them
installed
in
the
cottage
she
intended
building
in
the
meantime
she
could
arrange
one
way
and
another
to
get
work
for
billy
through
the
winter
she
would
guarantee
this
work
and
she
knew
a
small
house
they
could
rent
just
at
the
end
of
the
under
her
supervision
billy
could
take
charge
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
building
in
this
way
they
would
be
earning
money
preparing
themselves
for
independent
farming
life
and
have
opportunity
to
look
about
them
but
her
persuasions
were
in
vain
in
the
end
saxon
succinctly
epitomized
their
point
of
view
we
ca
stop
at
the
first
place
even
if
it
is
as
beautiful
and
kind
as
yours
and
as
nice
as
this
valley
is
we
do
even
know
what
we
want
we
got
to
go
farther
and
see
all
kinds
of
places
and
all
kinds
of
ways
in
order
to
find
out
we
not
in
a
hurry
to
make
up
our
minds
we
want
to
make
oh
so
very
sure
and
besides
she
hesitated
besides
we
do
like
altogether
flat
land
billy
wants
some
hills
in
his
and
so
do
when
they
were
ready
to
leave
mortimer
offered
to
present
saxon
with
the
story
of
the
files
but
saxon
shook
her
head
and
got
some
money
from
billy
it
says
it
costs
two
dollars
she
said
will
you
buy
me
one
and
keep
it
till
we
get
settled
then
i
write
and
you
can
send
it
to
oh
you
americans
mortimer
chided
accepting
the
money
but
you
must
promise
to
write
from
time
to
time
before
you
she
saw
them
to
the
county
road
you
are
brave
young
things
she
said
at
parting
i
only
wish
i
were
going
with
you
my
pack
upon
my
back
you
perfectly
glorious
the
pair
of
you
if
ever
i
can
do
anything
for
you
just
let
me
know
bound
to
succeed
and
i
want
a
hand
in
it
myself
let
me
know
how
that
government
land
turns
out
though
i
warn
you
i
have
much
faith
in
its
feasibility
it
sure
to
be
too
far
away
from
she
shook
hands
with
billy
saxon
she
caught
into
her
arms
and
kissed
be
brave
she
said
with
low
earnestness
in
saxon
ear
you
win
you
are
starting
with
the
right
ideas
and
you
were
right
not
to
accept
my
proposition
but
remember
it
or
better
will
always
be
open
to
you
you
young
yet
both
of
you
do
be
in
a
hurry
any
time
you
stop
anywhere
for
a
while
let
me
know
and
i
mail
you
heaps
of
agricultural
reports
and
farm
publications
heaps
and
heaps
and
heaps
of
chapter
iv
billy
sat
motionless
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
their
little
room
in
san
jose
that
night
a
musing
expression
in
his
eyes
well
he
remarked
at
last
with
a
breath
all
i
got
to
say
is
there
some
pretty
nice
people
in
this
world
after
all
take
mortimer
now
she
the
real
goods
regular
old
a
fine
educated
lady
saxon
agreed
and
not
a
bit
ashamed
to
work
at
farming
herself
and
she
made
it
go
on
twenty
acres
no
ten
and
paid
for
an
all
improvements
supported
herself
four
hired
men
a
swede
woman
an
daughter
an
her
own
nephew
it
gets
me
ten
acres
why
my
father
never
talked
one
hundred
an
sixty
acres
even
your
brother
tom
still
talks
in
quarter
an
she
was
only
a
woman
too
we
was
lucky
in
meetin
was
it
an
adventure
saxon
cried
that
what
comes
of
traveling
you
never
know
what
going
to
happen
next
it
jumped
right
out
at
us
just
when
we
were
tired
and
wondering
how
much
farther
to
san
jose
we
were
expecting
it
at
all
and
she
did
treat
us
as
if
we
were
tramping
and
that
house
so
clean
and
beautiful
you
could
eat
off
the
floor
i
never
dreamed
of
anything
so
sweet
and
lovely
as
the
inside
of
that
it
smelt
good
billy
supplied
that
the
very
thing
it
what
the
women
pages
call
atmosphere
i
did
know
what
they
meant
before
that
house
has
beautiful
sweet
atmosphere
like
all
your
nice
underthings
said
billy
and
that
the
next
step
after
keeping
your
body
sweet
and
clean
and
beautiful
it
to
have
your
house
sweet
and
clean
and
but
it
ca
be
a
rented
one
saxon
you
got
to
own
it
landlords
do
build
houses
like
that
just
the
same
one
thing
stuck
out
plain
that
house
was
not
expensive
it
was
the
cost
it
was
the
way
the
wood
was
ordinary
wood
you
can
buy
in
any
lumber
yard
why
our
house
on
pine
street
was
made
out
of
the
same
kind
of
wood
but
the
way
it
was
made
was
different
i
ca
explain
but
you
can
see
what
i
saxon
revisioning
the
little
bungalow
they
had
just
left
repeated
absently
that
it
the
the
next
morning
they
were
early
afoot
seeking
through
the
suburbs
of
san
jose
the
road
to
san
juan
and
monterey
saxon
limp
had
increased
beginning
with
a
burst
blister
her
heel
was
skinning
rapidly
billy
remembered
his
father
talks
about
care
of
the
feet
and
stopped
at
a
butcher
shop
to
buy
five
cents
worth
of
mutton
tallow
that
the
stuff
he
told
saxon
clean
and
the
feet
well
greased
we
put
some
on
as
soon
as
we
clear
of
town
an
we
might
as
well
go
easy
for
a
couple
of
days
now
if
i
could
get
a
little
work
so
as
you
could
rest
up
several
days
it
be
just
the
thing
i
keep
my
eye
almost
on
the
outskirts
of
town
he
left
saxon
on
the
county
road
and
went
up
a
long
driveway
to
what
appeared
a
large
farm
he
came
back
beaming
it
all
hunkydory
he
called
as
he
approached
we
just
go
down
to
that
clump
of
trees
by
the
creek
an
pitch
camp
i
start
work
in
the
mornin
two
dollars
a
day
an
board
myself
it
been
a
dollar
an
a
half
if
he
furnished
the
board
i
told
i
liked
the
other
way
best
an
that
i
had
my
camp
with
me
the
weather
fine
an
we
can
make
out
a
few
days
till
your
foot
in
shape
come
on
we
pitch
a
regular
decent
how
did
you
get
the
job
saxon
asked
as
they
cast
about
determining
their
wait
till
we
get
fixed
an
i
tell
you
all
about
it
it
was
a
dream
a
not
until
the
bed
was
spread
the
fire
built
and
a
pot
of
beans
boiling
did
billy
throw
down
the
last
armful
of
wood
and
begin
in
the
first
place
benson
no
geezer
you
think
he
was
a
farmer
to
look
at
he
up
to
date
sharp
as
tacks
talks
an
acts
like
a
business
man
i
could
see
that
just
by
lookin
at
his
place
before
i
seen
him
he
took
about
fifteen
seconds
to
size
me
up
you
plow
says
he
thing
i
told
horses

hatched
in
a
says
i
an
just
then
you
remember
that
load
of
machinery
that
come
in
after
me
just
then
it

up
about
four
horses

the
right
back
in
for
unloadin
an
right
here
i
wanta
tell
you
it
was
some
nifty
drivin
he
was
askin
i
could
see
by
the
tracks
the
wagons
all
ben
goin
around
the
barn
to
the
left
what
he
was
askin
was
too
close
work
for
comfort
a
double
turn
like
an
s
between
a
corner
of
a
paddock
an
around
the
corner
of
the
barn
to
the
last
swing
an
to
eat
into
the
little
room
there
was
there
was
piles
of
manure
just
thrown
outa
the
barn
an
not
hauled
away
yet
but
i
was
lettin
on

driver
gave
me
the
lines

i
could
see

could
it
himself
i
never

the
horses
but

if

them
leaders
clean
to
the
top
of
the
manure
till
the
nigh
horse
was
the
side
of
the
barn
to
make
it
an
the
off
hind
hub
was
cuttin
the
corner
post
of
the
paddock
to
miss
by
six
inches
it
was
the
only
way
an
them
horses
was
sure
beauts
the
leaders
slacked
back
an
darn
near
sat
down
on
their
singletrees
when
i
threw
the
back
into
the
wheelers
an
slammed
on
the
brake
an
stopped
on
the
very
precise
spot
do
benson
says
was
good
work
shucks
i
says
indifferent
as
hell
gim
me
something
real
hard
he
smiles
an
understands
done
that
well
he
says
i
particular
about
who
handles
my
horses
the
road
ai
no
place
for
you
you
must
be
a
good
man
gone
wrong
just
the
same
you
can
plow
with
my
horses
startin
in
mornin
which
shows
how
wise
he
was
i
had
showed
i
could
when
saxon
had
served
the
beans
and
billy
the
coffee
she
stood
still
a
moment
and
surveyed
the
spread
meal
on
the
blankets
the
canister
of
sugar
the
condensed
milk
tin
the
sliced
corned
beef
the
lettuce
salad
and
sliced
tomatoes
the
slices
of
fresh
french
bread
and
the
steaming
plates
of
beans
and
mugs
of
coffee
what
a
difference
from
last
night
saxon
exclaimed
clapping
her
hands
it
like
an
adventure
out
of
a
book
oh
that
boy
i
went
fishing
with
think
of
that
beautiful
table
and
that
beautiful
house
last
night
and
then
look
at
this
why
we
could
have
lived
a
thousand
years
on
end
in
oakland
and
never
met
a
woman
like
mortimer
nor
dreamed
a
house
like
hers
existed
and
billy
just
to
think
we
only
just
billy
worked
for
three
days
and
while
insisting
that
he
was
doing
very
well
he
freely
admitted
that
there
was
more
in
plowing
than
he
had
thought
saxon
experienced
quiet
satisfaction
when
she
learned
he
was
enjoying
it
i
never
thought
i
like
plowin
much
he
observed
but
it
fine
it
good
for
the
too
they
do
get
exercise
enough
in
teamin
if
ever
i
trained
for
another
fight
you
bet
i
take
a
whack
at
plowin
an
you
know
the
ground
has
a
regular
good
smell
to
it
over
an
turnin
over
gosh
it
good
enough
to
eat
that
smell
an
it
just
goes
on
turnin
up
an
over
fresh
an
thick
good
all
day
long
an
the
horses
are
they
know
their
business
as
well
as
a
man
that
one
thing
benson
ai
got
a
scrub
horse
on
the
the
last
day
billy
worked
the
sky
clouded
over
the
air
grew
damp
a
strong
wind
began
to
blow
from
the
southeast
and
all
the
signs
were
present
of
the
first
winter
rain
billy
came
back
in
the
evening
with
a
small
roll
of
old
canvas
he
had
borrowed
which
he
proceeded
to
arrange
over
their
bed
on
a
framework
so
as
to
shed
rain
several
times
he
complained
about
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
it
had
been
bothering
him
all
day
he
told
saxon
for
several
days
slightly
in
fact
and
it
was
as
tender
as
a
boil
most
likely
a
splinter
but
he
had
been
unable
to
locate
it
he
went
ahead
with
storm
preparations
elevating
the
bed
on
old
boards
which
he
lugged
from
a
disused
barn
falling
to
decay
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
creek
upon
the
boards
he
heaped
dry
leaves
for
a
mattress
he
concluded
by
reinforcing
the
canvas
with
additional
guys
of
odd
pieces
of
rope
and
when
the
first
splashes
of
rain
arrived
saxon
was
delighted
billy
betrayed
little
interest
his
finger
was
hurting
too
much
he
said
neither
he
nor
saxon
could
make
anything
of
it
and
both
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
a
felon
it
might
be
a
saxon
hazarded
what
that
i
do
know
i
remember
cady
had
one
once
but
i
was
too
small
it
was
the
little
finger
too
she
poulticed
it
i
think
and
i
remember
she
dressed
it
with
some
kind
of
salve
it
got
awful
bad
and
finished
by
her
losing
the
nail
after
that
it
got
well
quick
and
a
new
nail
grew
out
suppose
i
make
a
hot
bread
poultice
for
billy
declined
being
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
in
the
morning
saxon
was
troubled
and
as
she
dozed
off
she
knew
that
he
was
lying
restlessly
wide
awake
a
few
minutes
afterward
roused
by
a
heavy
blast
of
wind
and
rain
on
the
canvas
she
heard
billy
softly
groaning
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
with
her
free
hand
in
the
way
she
knew
manipulating
his
forehead
and
the
surfaces
around
his
eyes
soothed
him
off
to
sleep
again
she
slept
and
again
she
was
aroused
this
time
not
by
the
storm
but
by
billy
she
could
not
see
but
by
feeling
she
ascertained
his
strange
position
he
was
outside
the
blankets
and
on
his
knees
his
forehead
resting
on
the
boards
his
shoulders
writhing
with
suppressed
anguish
she
pulsin
to
beat
the
band
he
said
when
she
spoke
it
worsen
a
thousand
toothaches
but
it
ai
nothin
if
only
the
canvas
blow
down
think
what
our
folks
had
to
stand
he
gritted
out
between
groans
why
my
father
was
out
in
the
mountains
an
the
man
with
got
mauled
by
a
grizzly
clean
clawed
to
the
bones
all
over
an
they
was
outa
grub
an
had
to
travel
two
times
outa
three
when
my
father
put
on
the
horse
he
faint
away
had
to
be
tied
on
an
that
lasted
five
weeks
an
he
pulled
through
then
there
was
jack
quigley
he
blowed
off
his
whole
right
hand
with
the
burstin
of
his
shotgun
the
huntin
dog
pup
he
had
with
ate
up
three
of
the
fingers
an
he
was
all
alone
in
the
marsh
an
but
saxon
heard
no
more
of
the
adventures
of
jack
quigley
a
terrific
blast
of
wind
parted
several
of
the
guys
collapsed
the
framework
and
for
a
moment
buried
them
under
the
canvas
the
next
moment
canvas
framework
and
trailing
guys
were
whisked
away
into
the
darkness
and
saxon
and
billy
were
deluged
with
rain
only
one
thing
to
do
he
yelled
in
her
ear
gather
up
the
things
an
get
into
that
old
they
accomplished
this
in
the
drenching
darkness
making
two
trips
across
the
stepping
stones
of
the
shallow
creek
and
soaking
themselves
to
the
knees
the
old
barn
leaked
like
a
sieve
but
they
managed
to
find
a
dry
space
on
which
to
spread
their
anything
but
dry
bedding
pain
was
to
saxon
an
hour
was
required
to
subdue
him
to
a
doze
and
only
by
continuously
stroking
his
forehead
could
she
keep
him
asleep
shivering
and
miserable
she
accepted
a
night
of
wakefulness
gladly
with
the
knowledge
that
she
kept
him
from
knowing
the
worst
of
his
pain
at
the
time
when
she
had
decided
it
must
be
past
midnight
there
was
an
interruption
from
the
open
doorway
came
a
flash
of
electric
light
like
a
tiny
searchlight
which
quested
about
the
barn
and
came
to
rest
on
her
and
billy
from
the
source
of
light
a
harsh
voice
said
ah
ha
i
got
you
come
out
of
that
billy
sat
up
his
eyes
dazzled
by
the
light
the
voice
behind
the
light
was
approaching
and
reiterating
its
demand
that
they
come
out
of
that
what
up
billy
asked
me
was
the
answer
an
wide
awake
you
the
voice
was
now
beside
them
scarcely
a
yard
away
yet
they
could
see
nothing
on
account
of
the
light
which
was
intermittent
frequently
going
out
for
an
instant
as
the
operator
thumb
tired
on
the
switch
come
on
get
a
move
on
the
voice
went
on
roll

your
blankets

on

constable

billy
warned
now

your
kind
before
the
constable
retorted
an
i
got
my
little
persuader
with
me
take
a
the
shaft
of
light
shifted
and
out
of
the
darkness
illuminated
with
ghastly
brilliance
they
saw
thrust
a
hand
holding
a
revolver
this
hand
seemed
a
thing
apart
with
no
corporeal
attachment
and
it
appeared
and
disappeared
like
an
apparition
as
the
wavered
on
the
switch
one
moment
they
were
staring
at
the
hand
and
revolver
the
next
moment
at
impenetrable
darkness
and
the
next
moment
again
at
the
hand
and
revolver
now
i
guess
you
come
the
constable
gloated
you
got
another
guess
comin
billy
began
but
at
that
moment
the
light
went
out
they
heard
a
quick
movement
on
the
officer
part
and
the
thud
of
the
on
the
ground
both
billy
and
the
constable
fumbled
for
it
but
billy
found
it
and
flashed
it
on
the
other
they
saw
a
man
clad
in
streaming
oilskins
he
was
an
old
man
and
reminded
saxon
of
the
sort
she
had
been
used
to
see
in
grand
army
processions
on
decoration
day
give
me
that
stick
he
bullied
billy
sneered
a
refusal
then
i
put
a
hole
through
you
by
he
leveled
the
revolver
directly
at
billy
whose
thumb
on
the
switch
did
not
waver
and
they
could
see
the
gleaming
in
the
chambers
of
the
cylinder
why
you
whiskery
old
skunk
you
ai
got
the
grit
to
shoot
sour
apples
was
billy
answer
i
know
your
kind
brave
as
lions
when
it
comes
to
pullin
miserable
bindle
stiffs
but
as
leery
as
a
yellow
dog
when
you
face
a
man
pull
that
trigger
why
you
pusillanimous
piece
of
dirt
you
run
with
your
tail
between
your
legs
if
i
said
boo
suiting
action
to
the
word
billy
let
out
an
explosive
boo
and
saxon
giggled
involuntarily
at
the
startle
it
caused
in
the
constable
i
give
you
a
last
chance
the
latter
grated
through
his
teeth
turn
over
that
an
come
along
peaceable
or
i
lay
you
saxon
was
frightened
for
billy
sake
and
yet
only
half
frightened
she
had
a
faith
that
the
man
dared
not
fire
and
she
felt
the
old
familiar
thrills
of
admiration
for
billy
courage
she
could
not
see
his
face
but
she
knew
in
all
certitude
that
it
was
bleak
and
passionless
in
the
terrifying
way
she
had
seen
it
when
he
fought
the
three
irishmen
you
ai
the
first
man
i
killed
the
constable
threatened
i
an
old
soldier
an
i
ai
squeamish
over

to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
saxon
broke
in
trying
to
shame
and
disgrace

outside

the
billy
shifted
the
light
until
it
illuminated
the
doorway
and
then
threw
the
stick
as
he
would
pitch
a
baseball
they
were
now
in
total
darkness
and
they
could
hear
the
intruder
gritting
his
teeth
in
rage
now

your
shootin
an
see

billy
advised
menacingly
saxon
felt
for
billy
hand
and
squeezed
it
proudly
the
constable
grumbled
some
threat
what
that
billy
demanded
sharply

was
the
roar
of
the
storm
that
they
could
hear
nothing
billy
rolled
a
cigarette
when
he
lighted
it
they
saw
the
barn
was
empty
billy
chuckled
say
i
was
so
mad
i
clean

my
it
only

hot
breakfast

benson
billy
demurred
i
telephone
him
from
town
it
will
only
cost
five
cents
i
saw
he
had
a
wire
and
you
could
plow

account
of
the
rain
even
if
your
finger
was
well
besides
we

mending
together

later
saxon
and
billy
took
an
electric
car
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
started
a
second
time
for
san
juan
puddles
were
standing
in
the
road
but
the
sun
shone
from
a
blue
sky
and
everywhere
on
the
ground
was
a
faint
hint
of
budding
green
at
benson
saxon
waited
while
billy
went
in
to
get
his
six
dollars
for
the
three
days
plowing
kicked
like
a
steer
because
i
was

he
told

he
came
back

he

of

an
hour
afterward
with
a
good
three
miles
to
their
credit
they
edged
to
the
side
of
the
road
at
the
sound
of
an
automobile
behind
them
but
the
machine
did
not
pass
benson
was
alone
in
it
and
he
came
to
a
stop
alongside
where
are
you
bound
he
inquired
of
billy
with
a
quick
measuring
glance
at
saxon
monterey
if
you
goin
that
far
billy
answered
with
a
chuckle
i
can
give
you
a
lift
as
far
as
watsonville
it
would
take
you
several
days
on
shank

with
those
loads

he
addressed
saxon
directly
do

glanced
to
billy
go
on
he
approved
it

in
this

my
wife
benson
oh

one
that

your
husband
away
from

benson
accused
good
humoredly
as
he
tucked
the
robe
around
her
saxon
shouldered
the
responsibility
and
became
absorbed
in
watching
him
start
the
car
i
be
a
mighty
poor
farmer
if
i
owned
no
more
land
than
you
plowed
before
you
came
to
me
benson
with
a
twinkling
eye
jerked
over
his
shoulder
to
billy
i
never
had
my
hands
on
a
plow
but
once
before
billy
confessed
but
a
fellow
has
to
learn
some
at
two
dollars
a
day
if
he
can
get
some
alfalfa
artist
to
put
up
for
it
billy
met
him
complacently
benson
laughed
heartily
you
a
quick
learner
he
complimented
i
could
see
that
you
and
plows
were
on
speaking
acquaintance
but
you
took
hold
right
there
is
one
man
in
ten
i
could
hire
off
the
county
road
that
could
do
as
well
as
you
were
doing
on
the
third
day
but
your
big
asset
is
that
you
know
horses
it
was
half
a
joke
when
i
told
you
to
take
the
lines
that
morning
you
a
trained
horseman
and
a
born
horseman
as
he
very
gentle
with
horses
saxon
said
but
there
more
than
that
to
it
benson
took
her
up
your
got
the
way
with
him
it
hard
to
explain
but
that
what
it
is
the
way
it
an
instinct
almost
kindness
is
necessary
but
grip
is
more
so
your
husband
grips
his
horses
take
the
test
i
gave
him
with
the
load
it
was
too
complicated
and
severe
kindness
have
done
it
it
took
grip
i
could
see
it
the
moment
he
started
there
was
any
doubt
in
his
mind
there
was
any
doubt
in
the
horses
they
got
the
feel
of
him
they
just
knew
the
thing
was
going
to
be
done
and
that
it
was
up
to
them
to
do
it
they
did
have
any
fear
but
just
the
same
they
knew
the
boss
was
in
the
seat
when
he
took
hold
of
those
lines
he
took
hold
of
the
horses
he
gripped
them
do
you
see
he
picked
them
up
and
put
them
where
he
wanted
them
swung
them
up
and
down
and
right
and
left
made
them
pull
and
slack
and
back
and
they
knew
everything
was
going
to
come
out
right
oh
horses
may
be
stupid
but
they
not
altogether
fools
they
know
when
the
proper
horseman
has
hold
of
them
though
how
they
know
it
so
quickly
is
beyond
benson
paused
half
vexed
at
his
volubility
and
gazed
keenly
at
saxon
to
see
if
she
had
followed
him
what
he
saw
in
her
face
and
eyes
satisfied
him
and
he
added
with
a
short
laugh
horseflesh
is
a
hobby
of
mine
do
think
otherwise
because
i
am
running
a
stink
engine
i
rather
be
streaking
along
here
behind
a
pair
of
but
i
lose
time
on
them
and
worse
than
that
be
too
anxious
about
them
all
the
time
as
for
this
thing
why
it
has
no
nerves
no
delicate
joints
nor
tendons
it
a
case
of
let
her
the
miles
flew
past
and
saxon
was
soon
deep
in
talk
with
her
host
here
again
she
discerned
immediately
was
a
type
of
the
new
farmer
the
knowledge
she
had
picked
up
enabled
her
to
talk
to
advantage
and
when
benson
talked
she
was
amazed
that
she
could
understand
so
much
in
response
to
his
direct
querying
she
told
him
her
and
billy
plans
sketching
the
oakland
life
vaguely
and
dwelling
on
their
future
intentions
almost
as
in
a
dream
when
they
passed
the
nurseries
at
morgan
hill
she
learned
they
had
come
twenty
miles
and
realized
that
it
was
a
longer
stretch
than
they
had
planned
to
walk
that
day
and
still
the
machine
hummed
on
eating
up
the
distance
as
ever
it
flashed
into
view
i
wondered
what
so
good
a
man
as
your
husband
was
doing
on
the
road
benson
told
her
yes
she
smiled
he
said
you
said
he
must
be
a
good
man
gone
but
you
see
i
did
know
about
you
now
i
understand
though
i
must
say
it
extraordinary
in
these
days
for
a
young
couple
like
you
to
pack
your
blankets
in
search
of
land
and
before
i
forget
it
i
want
to
tell
you
one
he
turned
to
billy
i
am
just
telling
your
wife
that
there
an
job
waiting
for
you
on
my
ranch
and
a
tight
little
cottage
of
three
rooms
the
two
of
you
can
housekeep
in
do
among
other
things
saxon
discovered
that
benson
had
gone
through
the
college
of
agriculture
at
the
university
of
california
a
branch
of
learning
she
had
not
known
existed
he
gave
her
small
hope
in
her
search
for
government
land
the
only
government
land
left
he
informed
her
is
what
is
not
good
enough
to
take
up
for
one
reason
or
another
if
it
good
land
down
there
where
you
going
then
the
market
is
inaccessible
i
know
no
railroads
tap
in
wait
till
we
strike
pajaro
valley
he
said
when
they
had
passed
gilroy
and
were
booming
on
toward
sargent
i
show
you
what
can
be
done
with
the
soil
and
not
by
graduates
but
by
uneducated
foreigners
that
the
high
and
mighty
american
has
always
sneered
at
show
you
it
one
of
the
most
wonderful
demonstrations
in
the
at
sargent
he
left
them
in
the
machine
a
few
minutes
while
he
transacted
business
whew
it
beats
hikin
billy
said
the
day
young
yet
and
when
he
drops
us
we
be
fresh
for
a
few
miles
on
our
own
just
the
same
when
we
get
settled
an
well
off
i
guess
i
stick
by
horses
always
be
good
enough
for
a
machine
only
good
to
get
somewhere
in
a
hurry
saxon
agreed
of
course
if
we
got
very
very
rich
say
saxon
billy
broke
in
suddenly
struck
with
an
idea
learned
one
thing
i
ai
afraid
any
more
of
not
gettin
work
in
the
country
i
was
at
first
but
i
did
tell
you
just
the
same
i
was
dead
leery
when
we
pulled
out
on
the
san
leandro
pike
an
here
already
is
two
places
open
mortimer
an
benson
an
steady
jobs
too
yep
a
man
can
get
work
in
the
ah
saxon
amended
with
a
proud
little
smile
you
have
said
it
right
any
good
man
can
get
work
in
the
country
the
big
farmers
hire
men
out
of
sure
they
ai
in
it
for
their
health
he
grinned
and
they
jump
at
you
that
because
you
are
a
good
man
they
can
see
it
with
half
an
eye
why
billy
take
all
the
working
tramps
we
met
on
the
road
already
there
was
one
to
compare
with
you
i
looked
them
over
they
all
weak
weak
in
their
bodies
weak
in
their
heads
weak
both
yep
they
are
a
pretty
measly
bunch
billy
admitted
modestly
it
the
wrong
time
of
the
year
to
see
pajaro
valley
benson
said
when
he
again
sat
beside
saxon
and
sargent
was
a
thing
of
the
past
just
the
same
it
worth
seeing
any
time
think
of
it
twelve
thousand
acres
of
apples
do
you
know
what
they
call
pajaro
valley
now
new
dalmatia
we
being
squeezed
out
we
yankees
thought
we
were
smart
well
the
dalmatians
came
along
and
showed
they
were
smarter
they
were
miserable
immigrants
poorer
than
job
turkey
first
they
worked
at
day
labor
in
the
fruit
harvest
next
they
began
in
a
small
way
buying
the
apples
on
the
trees
the
more
money
they
made
the
bigger
became
their
deals
pretty
soon
they
were
renting
the
orchards
on
long
leases
and
now
they
are
beginning
to
buy
the
land
it
wo
be
long
before
they
own
the
whole
valley
and
the
last
american
will
be
gone
oh
our
smart
yankees
why
those
first
ragged
slavs
in
their
first
little
deals
with
us
only
made
something
like
two
and
three
thousand
per
cent
profits
and
now
they
satisfied
to
make
a
hundred
per
cent
it
a
calamity
if
their
profits
sink
to
or
fifty
per
it
like
san
leandro
saxon
said
the
original
owners
of
the
land
are
about
all
gone
already
it
intensive
she
liked
that
phrase
it
is
a
case
of
having
a
lot
of
acres
but
of
how
much
they
can
get
out
of
one
yes
and
more
than
that
benson
answered
nodding
his
head
emphatically
lots
of
them
like
luke
scurich
are
in
it
on
a
large
scale
several
of
them
are
worth
a
quarter
of
a
million
already
i
know
ten
of
them
who
will
average
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
each
they
have
a
way
with
apples
it
almost
a
gift
they
know
trees
in
much
the
same
way
your
husband
knows
horses
each
tree
is
just
as
much
an
individual
to
them
as
a
horse
is
to
me
they
know
each
tree
its
whole
history
everything
that
ever
happened
to
it
its
every
idiosyncrasy
they
have
their
fingers
on
its
pulse
they
can
tell
if
it
feeling
as
well
as
it
felt
yesterday
and
if
it
is
they
know
why
and
proceed
to
remedy
matters
for
it
they
can
look
at
a
tree
in
bloom
and
tell
how
many
boxes
of
apples
it
will
pack
and
not
only
that
know
what
the
quality
and
grades
of
those
apples
are
going
to
be
why
they
know
each
individual
apple
and
they
pick
it
tenderly
with
love
never
hurting
it
and
pack
it
and
ship
it
tenderly
and
with
love
and
when
it
arrives
at
market
it
is
bruised
nor
rotten
and
it
fetches
top
price
yes
it
more
than
intensive
these
adriatic
slavs
are
in
business
not
only
can
they
grow
apples
but
they
can
sell
apples
no
market
what
does
it
matter
make
a
market
that
their
way
while
our
kind
let
the
crops
rot
under
the
trees
look
at
peter
mengol
every
year
he
goes
to
england
and
he
takes
a
hundred
carloads
of
yellow
newton
pippins
with
him
why
those
dalmatians
are
showing
pajaro
apples
on
the
south
african
market
right
now
and
coining
money
out
of
it
hand
over
what
do
they
do
with
all
the
money
saxon
queried
buy
the
americans
of
pajaro
valley
out
of
course
as
they
are
already
and
then
she
questioned
benson
looked
at
her
quickly
then
they
start
buying
the
americans
out
of
some
other
valley
and
the
americans
will
spend
the
money
and
by
the
second
generation
start
rotting
in
the
cities
as
you
and
your
husband
would
have
rotted
if
you
had
got
saxon
could
not
repress
a
as
mary
had
rotted
she
thought
as
bert
and
all
the
rest
had
rotted
as
tom
and
all
the
rest
were
rotting
oh
it
a
great
country
benson
was
continuing
but
we
not
a
great
people
kipling
is
right
we
crowded
out
and
sitting
on
the
stoop
and
the
worst
of
it
is
there
no
reason
we
should
know
better
we
teaching
it
in
all
our
agricultural
colleges
experiment
stations
and
demonstration
trains
but
the
people
wo
take
hold
and
the
immigrant
who
has
learned
in
a
hard
school
beats
them
out
why
after
i
graduated
and
before
my
father
died
he
was
of
the
old
school
and
laughed
at
what
he
called
my
theories
i
traveled
for
a
couple
of
years
i
wanted
to
see
how
the
old
countries
farmed
oh
i
saw
we
soon
enter
the
valley
you
bet
i
saw
first
thing
in
japan
the
terraced
hillsides
take
a
hill
so
steep
you
could
drive
a
horse
up
it
no
bother
to
them
they
terraced
it
a
stone
wall
and
good
masonry
six
feet
high
a
level
terrace
six
feet
wide
up
and
up
walls
and
terraces
the
same
thing
all
the
way
straight
into
the
air
walls
upon
walls
terraces
upon
terraces
until
i
seen
walls
built
to
make
terraces
and
walls
for
four
or
five
feet
of
soil
they
could
grow
things
on
and
that
soil
packed
up
the
mountainsides
in
baskets
on
their
backs
same
thing
everywhere
i
went
in
greece
in
ireland
in
dalmatia
i
went
there
too
they
went
around
and
gathered
every
bit
of
soil
they
could
find
gleaned
it
and
even
stole
it
by
the
shovelful
or
handful
and
carried
it
up
the
mountains
on
their
backs
and
built
farms
built
them
made
them
on
the
naked
rock
why
in
france
i
seen
hill
peasants
mining
their
for
soil
as
our
fathers
mined
the
streams
of
california
for
gold
only
our
gold
gone
and
the
soil
remains
turning
over
and
over
doing
something
growing
something
all
the
time
now
i
guess
i
my
god
billy
muttered
in
tones
our
folks
never
done
that
no
wonder
they
lost
there
the
valley
now
benson
said
look
at
those
trees
look
at
those
hillsides
that
new
dalmatia
look
at
it
an
apple
paradise
look
at
that
soil
look
at
the
way
it
worked
it
was
not
a
large
valley
that
saxon
saw
but
everywhere
across
the
and
up
the
low
rolling
hills
the
industry
of
the
dalmatians
was
evident
as
she
looked
she
listened
to
benson
do
you
know
what
the
old
settlers
did
with
this
beautiful
soil
planted
the
flats
in
grain
and
pastured
cattle
on
the
hills
and
now
twelve
thousand
acres
of
it
are
in
apples
it
a
regular
show
place
for
the
eastern
guests
at
del
monte
who
run
out
here
in
their
machines
to
see
the
trees
in
bloom
or
fruit
take
matteo
lettunich
he
one
of
the
originals
entered
through
castle
garden
and
became
a
when
he
laid
eyes
on
this
valley
he
knew
it
was
his
klondike
he
leases
seven
hundred
acres
and
owns
a
hundred
and
thirty
of
his
own
the
finest
orchard
in
the
valley
and
he
packs
from
forty
to
fifty
thousand
boxes
of
export
apples
from
it
every
year
and
he
wo
let
a
soul
but
a
dalmatian
pick
a
single
apple
of
all
those
apples
one
day
in
a
banter
i
asked
him
what
he
sell
his
hundred
and
thirty
acres
for
he
answered
seriously
he
told
me
what
it
had
netted
him
year
by
year
and
struck
an
average
he
told
me
to
calculate
the
principal
from
that
at
six
per
cent
i
did
it
came
to
over
three
thousand
dollars
an
what
are
all
the
chinks
doin
in
the
valley
billy
asked
apples
too
benson
shook
his
head
but
that
another
point
where
we
americans
lose
out
there
anything
wasted
in
this
valley
not
a
core
nor
a
paring
and
it
the
americans
who
do
the
saving
there
are
furnaces
to
say
nothing
of
the
apple
canneries
and
cider
and
vinegar
factories
and
john
chinaman
owns
them
they
ship
fifteen
thousand
barrels
of
cider
and
vinegar
each
it
was
our
folks
that
made
this
country
billy
reflected
fought
for
it
opened
it
up
did
everything
but
develop
it
benson
caught
him
up
we
did
our
best
to
destroy
it
as
we
destroyed
the
soil
of
new
he
waved
his
hand
indicating
some
place
beyond
the
hills
salinas
lies
over
that
way
if
you
went
through
there
you
think
you
were
in
japan
and
more
than
one
fat
little
fruit
valley
in
california
has
been
taken
over
by
the
japanese
their
method
is
somewhat
different
from
the
dalmatians
first
they
drift
in
fruit
picking
at
day
wages
they
give
better
satisfaction
than
the
american
too
and
the
yankee
grower
is
glad
to
get
them
next
as
they
get
stronger
they
form
in
japanese
unions
and
proceed
to
run
the
american
labor
out
still
the
are
satisfied
the
next
step
is
when
the
japs
wo
pick
the
american
labor
is
gone
the
is
helpless
the
crop
perishes
then
in
step
the
jap
labor
bosses
they
the
masters
already
they
contract
for
the
crop
the
are
at
their
mercy
you
see
pretty
soon
the
japs
are
running
the
valley
the
have
become
absentee
landlords
and
are
busy
learning
higher
standards
of
living
in
the
cities
or
making
trips
to
europe
remains
only
one
more
step
the
japs
buy
them
out
they
got
to
sell
for
the
japs
control
the
labor
market
and
could
bankrupt
them
at
but
if
this
goes
on
what
is
left
for
us
asked
saxon
what
is
happening
those
of
us
who
have
anything
rot
in
the
cities
those
of
us
who
have
land
sell
it
and
go
to
the
cities
some
become
larger
capitalists
some
go
into
the
professions
the
rest
spend
the
money
and
start
rotting
when
it
gone
and
if
it
lasts
their
their
children
do
the
rotting
for
their
long
ride
was
soon
over
and
at
parting
benson
reminded
billy
of
the
steady
job
that
awaited
him
any
time
he
gave
the
word
i
guess
we
take
a
peep
at
that
government
land
first
billy
answered

packs
upon

i
tell

thing

he
protested

that
it
what
i
think

it
to
you

land
around

is
worth
three
thousand
an
acre
why
is
it
that
government
land
if
it
any
good
is
waiting
there
only
a
short
way
off
to
be
taken
for
the
billy
pondered
this
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
but
could
come
to
no
conclusion
at
last
he
cleared
his
throat
and
remarked
well
we
can
wait
till
we
see
it
first
ca
we
all
right
saxon
agreed
we
wait
till
we
see
chapter
vi
they
had
taken
the
direct
county
road
across
the
hills
from
monterey
instead
of
the
seventeen
mile
drive
around
by
the
coast
so
that
carmel
bay
came
upon
them
without
any
of
its
beauty
dropping
down
through
the
pungent
pines
they
passed
cottages
quaint
and
rustic
of
artists
and
writers
and
went
on
across
rolling
sandhills
held
to
place
by
sturdy
lupine
and
nodding
with
pale
california
poppies
saxon
screamed
in
sudden
wonder
of
delight
then
caught
her
breath
and
gazed
at
the
amazing
of
a
breaker
shot
through
with
golden
sunlight
overfalling
in
a
sweep
and
thundering
into
white
ruin
of
foam
on
a
crescent
beach
of
sand
scarcely
less
white
how
long
they
stood
and
watched
the
stately
procession
of
breakers
rising
from
out
the
deep
and
sea
to
froth
and
thunder
at
their
feet
saxon
did
not
know
she
was
recalled
to
herself
when
billy
laughing
tried
to
remove
the
telescope
basket
from
her
shoulders
you
kind
of
look
as
though
you
was
goin
to
stop
a
while
he
said
so
we
might
as
well
get
i
never
dreamed
it
i
never
dreamed
it
she
repeated
with
passionately
clasped
hands
i
i
thought
the
surf
at
the
cliff
house
was
wonderful
but
it
gave
no
idea
of
oh
look
look
did
you
ever
see
such
an
unspeakable
color
and
the
sunlight
flashing
right
through
it
oh
oh
oh
at
last
she
was
able
to
take
her
eyes
from
the
surf
and
gaze
at
the
of
deepest
and
piled
with
at
the
curve
of
the
beach
south
to
the
jagged
point
of
rocks
and
at
the
rugged
blue
mountains
seen
across
soft
low
hills
landward
up
carmel
valley
might
as
well
sit
down
an
take
it
easy
billy
indulged
her
this
is
too
good
to
want
to
run
away
from
all
at
saxon
assented
but
began
immediately
to
unlace
her
shoes
you
ai
to
billy
asked
in
surprised
delight
then
began
unlacing
his
own
but
before
they
were
ready
to
run
barefooted
on
the
perilous
fringe
of
sand
where
land
and
ocean
met
a
new
and
wonderful
thing
attracted
their
attention
down
from
the
dark
pines
and
across
the
sandhills
ran
a
man
naked
save
for
narrow
trunks
he
was
smooth
and
with
a
thatch
of
curly
yellow
hair
but
his
body
was
hugely
thewed
as
a
hercules
gee
must
be
sandow
billy
muttered
low
to
saxon
but
she
was
thinking
of
the
engraving
in
her
mother
scrapbook
and
of
the
vikings
on
the
wet
sands
of
england
the
runner
passed
them
a
dozen
feet
away
crossed
the
wet
sand
never
pausing
till
the
froth
wash
was
to
his
knees
while
above
him
ten
feet
at
least
upreared
a
wall
of
overtopping
water
huge
and
powerful
as
his
body
had
seemed
it
was
now
white
and
fragile
in
the
face
of
that
imminent
buffet
of
the
sea
saxon
gasped
with
anxiety
and
she
stole
a
look
at
billy
to
note
that
he
was
tense
with
watching
but
the
stranger
sprang
to
meet
the
blow
and
just
when
it
seemed
he
must
be
crushed
he
dived
into
the
face
of
the
breaker
and
disappeared
the
mighty
mass
of
water
fell
in
thunder
on
the
beach
but
beyond
appeared
a
yellow
head
one
arm
and
a
portion
of
a
shoulder
only
a
few
strokes
was
he
able
to
make
ere
he
was
compelled
to
dive
through
another
breaker
this
was
the
battle
to
win
seaward
against
the
sweep
of
the
shoreward
hastening
sea
each
time
he
dived
and
was
lost
to
view
saxon
caught
her
breath
and
clenched
her
hands
sometimes
after
the
passage
of
a
breaker
they
could
not
find
him
and
when
they
did
he
would
be
scores
of
feet
away
flung
there
like
a
chip
by
a
breaker
often
it
seemed
he
must
fail
and
be
thrown
upon
the
beach
but
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
was
beyond
the
outer
edge
of
the
surf
and
swimming
strong
no
longer
diving
but
topping
the
waves
soon
he
was
so
far
away
that
only
at
intervals
could
they
find
the
speck
of
him
that
too
vanished
and
saxon
and
billy
looked
at
each
other
she
with
amazement
at
the
swimmer
valor
billy
with
blue
eyes
flashing
some
swimmer
that
boy
some
swimmer
he
praised
nothing
about
say
i
only
know
but
now
i
goin
to
learn
if
i
could
do
that
i
be
so
proud
you
could
come
within
forty
feet
of
me
why
saxon
honest
to
god
i
sooner
do
what
he
done
than
own
a
farms
oh
i
can
swim
too
i
tellin
you
like
a
fish
i
swum
one
sunday
from
the
narrow
gauge
pier
to
sessions
basin
an
miles
but
i
never
seen
anything
like
that
guy
in
the
swimmin
line
an
i
not
goin
to
leave
this
beach
until
he
comes
all
by
his
lonely
out
there
in
a
mountain
sea
think
of
it
he
got
his
nerve
all
right
all
saxon
and
billy
ran
barefooted
up
and
down
the
beach
pursuing
each
other
with
brandished
snakes
of
seaweed
and
playing
like
children
for
an
hour
it
was
not
until
they
were
putting
on
their
shoes
that
they
sighted
the
yellow
head
bearing
shoreward
billy
was
at
the
edge
of
the
surf
to
meet
him
emerging
not
as
he
had
entered
but
red
from
the
pounding
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
the
sea
you
a
wonder
and
i
just
got
to
hand
it
to
you
billy
greeted
him
in
outspoken
admiration
it
was
a
big
surf
the
young
man
replied
with
a
nod
of
acknowledgment
it
do
happen
that
you
are
a
fighter
i
never
heard
of
billy
queried
striving
to
get
some
inkling
of
the
identity
of
the
physical
prodigy
the
other
laughed
and
shook
his
head
and
billy
could
not
guess
that
he
was
an
of
a
eleven
and
incidentally
the
father
of
a
family
and
the
author
of
many
books
he
looked
billy
over
with
an
eye
trained
in
measuring
freshmen
aspirants
for
the
gridiron
you
some
body
of
a
man
he
appreciated
you
strip
with
the
best
of
them
am
i
right
in
guessing
that
you
know
your
way
about
in
the
ring
billy
nodded
my
name
the
swimmer
scowled
with
a
futile
effort
at
recollection
bill
bill
roberts
billy
supplemented
oh
ho
not
big
bill
roberts
why
i
saw
you
fight
before
the
earthquake
in
the
mechanic
pavilion
it
was
a
preliminary
to
eddie
hanlon
and
some
other
fellow
you

fighter

an
awful
wallop
but

slow
that
night
but

out
a
wet
hand
my
hazard

football
coach
that
was
a
couple
of
years
ago
read
about
you
in
the
papers
am
i
right
they
shook
hands
heartily
and
saxon
was
introduced
she
felt
very
small
beside
the
two
young
giants
and
very
proud
withal
that
she
belonged
to
the
race
that
gave
them
birth
she
could
only
listen
to
them
talk
i
like
to
put
on
the
gloves
with
you
every
day
for
half
an
hour
hazard
said

teach

lot

to

on
down
the
coast

for

the
same
i

teach
you
a
few
and
there
one
thing

could
teach
me
surf
i
swap
lessons
with
you
any
time
hazard
offered
he
turned
to
saxon
why
do
you
stop
in
carmel
for
a
while
it
is
so
it
beautiful
she
acknowledged
with
a
grateful
smile
but
she
turned
and
pointed
to
their
packs
on
the
edge
of
the
lupine
we
on
the
tramp
and
lookin
for
government
if
you
looking
down
past
the
sur
for
it
it
will
keep
he
laughed
well
i
got
to
run
along
and
get
some
clothes
on
if
you
come
back
this
way
look
me
up
anybody
will
tell
you
where
i
live
so
and
as
he
had
first
arrived
he
departed
crossing
the
sandhills
on
the
run
billy
followed
him
with
admiring
eyes
some
boy
some
boy
he
murmured
why
saxon
he
famous
if
seen
his
face
in
the
papers
once
i
seen
it
a
thousand
times
an
he
ai
a
bit
stuck
on
himself
just
man
to
man
say
i
beginnin
to
have
faith
in
the
old
stock
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
beach
and
in
the
tiny
main
street
bought
meat
vegetables
and
half
a
dozen
eggs
billy
had
to
drag
saxon
away
from
the
window
of
a
fascinating
shop
where
were
iridescent
pearls
of
abalone
set
and
unset
abalones
grow
here
all
along
the
coast
billy
assured
her
an
get
you
all
you
want
low
tide
the
my
father
had
a
set
of
made
of
abalone
shell
she
said
they
were
set
in
pure
soft
gold
i
have
thought
about
them
for
years
and
i
wonder
who
has
them
they
turned
south
everywhere
from
among
the
pines
peeped
the
quaint
pretty
houses
of
the
artist
folk
and
they
were
not
prepared
where
the
road
dipped
to
carmel
river
for
the
building
that
met
their
eyes
i
know
what
it
is
saxon
almost
whispered
it
an
old
spanish
mission
it
the
carmel
mission
of
course
that
the
way
the
spaniards
came
up
from
mexico
building
missions
as
they
came
and
converting
the
until
we
chased
them
out
spaniards
an
indians
whole
kit
caboodle
billy
observed
with
calm
satisfaction
just
the
same
it
wonderful
saxon
mused
gazing
at
the
big
adobe
structure
there
is
the
mission
dolores
in
san
francisco
but
it
smaller
than
this
and
not
as
hidden
from
the
sea
by
low
hillocks
forsaken
by
human
being
and
human
habitation
the
church
of
clay
and
straw
and
stood
hushed
and
breathless
in
the
midst
of
the
adobe
ruins
which
once
had
housed
its
worshiping
thousands
the
spirit
of
the
place
descended
upon
saxon
and
billy
and
they
walked
softly
speaking
in
whispers
almost
afraid
to
go
in
through
the
open
ports
there
was
neither
priest
nor
worshiper
yet
they
found
all
the
evidences
of
use
by
a
congregation
which
billy
judged
must
be
small
from
the
number
of
the
benches
later
they
climbed
the
belfry
noting
the
timbers
and
in
the
gallery
discovering
the
pure
quality
of
their
voices
saxon
trembling
at
her
own
temerity
softly
sang
the
opening
bars
of
jesus
lover
of
my
delighted
with
the
result
she
leaned
over
the
railing
gradually
increasing
her
voice
to
its
full
strength
as
she
sang
jesus
lover
of
my
soul
let
me
to
thy
bosom
fly
while
the
nearer
waters
roll
while
the
tempest
still
is
nigh
hide
me
o
my
saviour
hide
till
the
storm
of
life
is
past
safe
into
the
haven
guide
and
receive
my
soul
at
billy
leaned
against
the
ancient
wall
and
loved
her
with
his
eyes
and
when
she
had
finished
he
murmured
almost
in
a
whisper
that
was
beautiful
just
beautiful
an
you
ought
to
your
face
when
you
sang
it
was
as
beautiful
as
your
voice
ai
it
funny
i
never
think
of
religion
except
when
i
think
of
they
camped
in
the
willow
bottom
cooked
dinner
and
spent
the
afternoon
on
the
point
of
low
rocks
north
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
they
had
not
intended
to
spend
the
afternoon
but
found
themselves
too
fascinated
to
turn
away
from
the
breakers
bursting
upon
the
rocks
and
from
the
many
kinds
of
colorful
sea
life
starfish
crabs
mussels
sea
anemones
and
once
in
a
a
small
devilfish
that
chilled
their
blood
when
it
cast
the
hooded
net
of
its
body
around
the
small
crabs
they
tossed
to
it
as
the
tide
grew
lower
they
gathered
a
mess
of
mussels
huge
fellows
five
and
six
inches
long
and
bearded
like
patriarchs
then
while
billy
wandered
in
a
vain
search
for
abalones
saxon
lay
and
dabbled
in
the
water
of
a
dipping
up
handfuls
of
glistening
jewels
ground
bits
of
shell
and
pebble
of
flashing
rose
and
blue
and
green
and
violet
billy
came
back
and
lay
beside
her
lazying
in
the
sunshine
and
together
they
watched
the
sun
sink
into
the
horizon
where
the
ocean
was
deepest
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
billy
and
sighed
with
sheer
repletion
of
content
it
seemed
she
had
never
lived
such
a
wonderful
day
it
was
as
if
all
old
dreams
were
coming
true
such
beauty
of
the
world
she
had
never
guessed
in
her
fondest
imagining
billy
pressed
her
hand
tenderly
what
was
you
thinkin
of
he
asked
as
they
arose
finally
to
go
oh
i
do
know
billy
perhaps
that
it
was
better
one
day
like
this
than
ten
thousand
years
in
chapter
vii
they
left
carmel
river
and
carmel
valley
behind
and
with
a
rising
sun
went
south
across
the
hills
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
the
road
was
badly
washed
and
gullied
and
showed
little
sign
of
travel
it
peters
out
altogether
farther
down
billy
said
from
there
on
only
horse
trails
but
i
do
see
much
signs
of
timber
an
this
none
so
good
it
only
used
for
pasture
no
farmin
to
speak
the
hills
were
bare
and
grassy
only
the
canyons
were
wooded
while
the
higher
and
more
distant
hills
were
furry
with
chaparral
once
they
saw
a
coyote
slide
into
the
brush
and
once
billy
wished
for
a
gun
when
a
large
wildcat
stared
at
them
malignantly
and
declined
to
run
until
routed
by
a
clod
of
earth
that
burst
about
its
ears
like
shrapnel
several
miles
along
saxon
complained
of
thirst
where
the
road
dipped
nearly
at
sea
level
to
cross
a
small
gulch
billy
looked
for
water
the
bed
of
the
gulch
was
damp
with
and
he
left
her
to
rest
while
he
sought
a
spring
say
he
hailed
a
few
minutes
afterward
come
on
down
you
just
got
ta
see
this
it
take
your
breath
saxon
followed
the
faint
path
that
led
steeply
down
through
the
thicket
midway
along
where
a
barbed
wire
fence
was
strung
high
across
the
mouth
of
the
gulch
and
weighted
down
with
big
rocks
she
caught
her
first
glimpse
of
the
tiny
beach
only
from
the
sea
could
one
guess
its
existence
so
completely
was
it
tucked
away
on
three
precipitous
sides
by
the
land
and
screened
by
the
thicket
furthermore
the
beach
was
the
head
of
a
narrow
rock
cove
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
up
which
pent
way
the
sea
roared
and
was
subdued
at
the
last
to
a
gentle
pulse
of
surf
beyond
the
mouth
many
detached
rocks
meeting
the
full
force
of
the
breakers
spouted
foam
and
spray
high
in
the
air
the
knees
of
these
rocks
seen
between
the
surges
were
black
with
mussels
on
their
tops
sprawled
huge
and
roaring
in
the
sun
while
overhead
uttering
shrill
cries
darted
and
wheeled
a
multitude
of
sea
birds
the
last
of
the
descent
from
the
barbed
wire
fence
was
a
sliding
fall
of
a
dozen
feet
and
saxon
arrived
on
the
soft
dry
sand
in
a
sitting
posture
oh
i
tell
you
it
just
great
billy
bubbled
look
at
it
for
a
camping
spot
in
among
the
trees
there
is
the
prettiest
spring
you
ever
saw
an
look
at
all
the
good
firewood
an
he
gazed
about
and
seaward
with
eyes
that
saw
what
no
rush
of
words
could
compass
an
an
everything
we
could
live
here
look
at
the
mussels
out
there
an
i
bet
you
we
could
catch
fish
what
d
say
we
stop
a
few
days
it
vacation
anyway
an
i
could
go
back
to
carmel
for
hooks
saxon
keenly
appraising
his
glowing
face
realized
that
he
was
indeed
being
won
from
the
city
an
there
ai
no
wind
here
he
was
recommending
not
a
breath
look
how
wild
it
is
just
as
if
we
was
a
thousand
miles
from
the
wind
which
had
been
fresh
and
raw
across
the
bare
hills
gained
no
entrance
to
the
cove
and
the
beach
was
warm
and
balmy
the
air
sweetly
pungent
with
the
thicket
odors
here
and
there
in
the
midst
of
the
thicket
severe
small
oak
trees
and
other
small
trees
of
which
saxon
did
not
know
the
names
her
enthusiasm
now
vied
with
billy
and
hand
in
hand
they
started
to
explore
here
where
we
can
play
real
robinson
crusoe
billy
cried
as
they
crossed
the
hard
sand
from
highwater
mark
to
the
edge
of
the
water
come
on
robinson
let
stop
over
of
course
i
your
man
friday
what
you
say
but
what
shall
we
do
with
man
saturday
she
pointed
in
mock
consternation
to
a
fresh
footprint
in
the
sand
he
may
be
a
savage
cannibal
you
no
chance
it
not
a
bare
foot
but
a
tennis
but
a
savage
could
get
a
tennis
shoe
from
a
drowned
or
eaten
sailor
could
he
she
contended
but
sailors
do
wear
tennis
shoes
was
billy
prompt
refutation
you
know
too
much
for
man
friday
she
chided
but
just
the
same
if
you
fetch
the
packs
we
make
camp
besides
it
might
have
been
a
sailor
that
was
eaten
it
might
have
been
a
by
the
end
of
an
hour
a
snug
camp
was
completed
the
blankets
were
spread
a
supply
of
firewood
was
chopped
from
the
seasoned
driftwood
and
over
a
fire
the
coffee
pot
had
begun
to
sing
saxon
called
to
billy
who
was
improvising
a
table
from
a
plank
she
pointed
seaward
on
the
far
point
of
rocks
naked
except
for
swimming
trunks
stood
a
man
he
was
gazing
toward
them
and
they
could
see
his
long
mop
of
dark
hair
blown
by
the
wind
as
he
started
to
climb
the
rocks
landward
billy
called
saxon
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
stranger
wore
tennis
shoes
in
a
few
minutes
he
dropped
down
from
the
rock
to
the
beach
and
walked
up
to
them
gosh
billy
whispered
to
saxon
he
lean
enough
but
look
at
his
muscles
everybody
down
here
seems
to
go
in
for
physical
as
the
newcomer
approached
saxon
glimpsed
sufficient
of
his
face
to
be
reminded
of
the
old
pioneers
and
of
a
certain
type
of
face
seen
frequently
among
the
old
soldiers
young
though
he
was
not
more
than
thirty
she
decided
this
man
had
the
same
long
and
narrow
face
with
the
high
cheekbones
high
and
slender
forehead
and
nose
high
lean
and
almost
beaked
the
lips
were
thin
and
sensitive
but
the
eyes
were
different
from
any
she
had
ever
seen
in
pioneer
or
veteran
or
any
man
they
were
so
dark
a
gray
that
they
seemed
brown
and
there
were
a
farness
and
alertness
of
vision
in
them
as
of
bright
questing
through
profounds
of
space
in
a
misty
way
saxon
felt
that
she
had
seen
him
before
hello
he
greeted
you
ought
to
be
comfortable
he
threw
down
a
partly
filled
sack
mussels
all
i
could
get
the
tide
not
low
enough
saxon
heard
billy
muffle
an
ejaculation
and
saw
painted
on
his
face
the
extremest
astonishment
well
honest
to
god
it
does
me
proud
to
meet
you
he
blurted
out
shake
hands
i
always
said
if
i
laid
eyes
on
you
i
say
but
billy
feelings
mastered
him
and
beginning
with
a
choking
giggle
he
roared
into
helpless
mirth
the
stranger
looked
at
him
curiously
across
their
clasped
hands
and
glanced
inquiringly
to
saxon
you
got
ta
excuse
me
billy
gurgled
pumping
the
other
hand
up
and
down
but
i
just
got
ta
laugh
why
honest
to
god
i
woke
up
nights
an
laughed
an
gone
to
sleep
again
do
you
recognize
saxon
the
same
identical
dude
say
friend
you
some
punkins
at
a
hundred
yards
dash
ai
you
and
then
in
a
sudden
rush
saxon
placed
him
he
it
was
who
had
stood
with
roy
blanchard
alongside
the
automobile
on
the
day
she
had
wandered
sick
and
unwitting
into
strange
neighborhoods
nor
had
that
day
been
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
remember
the
bricklayers
picnic
at
weasel
park
billy
was
asking
an
the
foot
race
why
i
know
that
nose
of
yours
anywhere
among
a
million
you
was
the
guy
that
stuck
your
cane
between
timothy
legs
an
started
the
grandest
roughhouse
weasel
park
or
any
other
park
ever
the
visitor
now
commenced
to
laugh
he
stood
on
one
leg
as
he
laughed
harder
then
stood
on
the
other
leg
finally
he
sat
down
on
a
log
of
driftwood
and
you
were
there
he
managed
to
gasp
to
billy
at
last
you
saw
it
you
saw
he
turned
to
saxon
and
you
she
nodded
say
billy
began
again
as
their
laughter
eased
down
what
i
wanta
know
is
what
you
wanta
do
it
for
say
what
you
wanta
do
it
for
i
been
askin
that
to
myself
ever
so
have
i
was
the
answer
you
did
know
timothy
mcmanus
did
you
no
i
never
seen
him
before
and
i
never
seen
him
but
what
you
wanta
do
it
for
billy
persisted
the
young
man
laughed
then
controlled
himself
to
save
my
life
i
do
know
i
have
one
friend
a
most
intelligent
chap
that
writes
sober
scientific
books
and
he
always
aching
to
throw
an
egg
into
an
electric
fan
to
see
what
will
happen
perhaps
that
the
way
it
was
with
me
except
that
there
was
no
aching
when
i
saw
those
legs
flying
past
i
merely
stuck
my
stick
in
between
i
know
i
was
going
to
do
it
i
just
did
it
timothy
mcmanus
was
no
more
surprised
than
i
did
they
catch
you
billy
asked
do
i
look
as
if
they
did
i
was
never
so
scared
in
my
life
timothy
mcmanus
himself
could
have
caught
me
that
day
but
what
happened
afterward
i
heard
they
had
a
fearful
roughhouse
but
i
could
stop
to
it
was
not
until
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
during
which
billy
described
the
fight
that
introductions
took
place
mark
hall
was
their
visitor
name
and
he
lived
in
a
bungalow
among
the
carmel
pines
but
how
did
you
ever
find
your
way
to
bierce
cove
he
was
curious
to
know
nobody
ever
dreams
of
it
from
the
so
that
its
name
saxon
said
it
the
name
we
gave
it
one
of
our
crowd
camped
here
one
summer
and
we
named
it
after
him
i
take
a
cup
of
that
coffee
if
you
this
to
saxon
and
then
i
show
your
husband
around
pretty
proud
of
this
cove
nobody
ever
comes
here
but
you
did
get
all
that
muscle
from
bein
chased
by
mcmanus
billy
observed
over
the
coffee
massage
under
tension
was
the
cryptic
reply
yes
billy
said
pondering
vacantly
do
you
eat
it
with
a
spoon
hall
laughed
i
show
you
take
any
muscle
you
want
tense
it
then
manipulate
it
with
your
fingers
so
and
an
that
done
all
that
billy
asked
skeptically
all
that
the
other
scorned
proudly
for
one
muscle
you
see
five
tucked
away
but
under
command
touch
your
finger
to
any
part
of
me
and
billy
complied
touching
the
right
breast
you
know
something
about
anatomy
picking
a
muscleless
spot
scolded
hall
billy
grinned
triumphantly
then
to
his
amazement
saw
a
muscle
grow
up
under
his
finger
he
prodded
it
and
found
it
hard
and
honest
massage
under
tension
hall
exulted
go
on
anywhere
you
and
anywhere
and
everywhere
billy
touched
muscles
large
and
small
rose
up
quivered
and
sank
down
till
the
whole
body
was
a
ripple
of
willed
quick
never
saw
anything
like
it
billy
marveled
at
the
end
an
i
seen
some
few
good
men
stripped
in
my
time
why
you
all
living
massage
under
tension
did
it
my
friend
the
doctors
gave
me
up
my
friends
called
me
the
sick
rat
and
the
mangy
poet
and
all
that
then
i
quit
the
city
came
down
to
carmel
and
went
in
for
the
open
air
and
massage
under
jim
hazard
did
get
his
muscles
that
way
billy
challenged
certainly
not
the
lucky
skunk
he
was
born
with
them
mine
made
that
the
difference
i
a
work
of
art
he
a
cave
bear
come
along
i
show
you
around
now
you
better
get
your
clothes
off
keep
on
only
your
shoes
and
pants
unless
you
got
a
pair
of
my
mother
was
a
poet
saxon
said
while
billy
was
getting
himself
ready
in
the
thicket
she
had
noted
hall
reference
to
himself
he
seemed
incurious
and
she
ventured
further
some
of
it
was
what
was
her
name
he
asked
idly
dayelle
wiley
brown
she
wrote
viking
quest
of
gold
caballero
at
little
meadow
and
a
lot
more
ten
of
them
are
in
story
of
the
files
i
the
book
at
home
he
remarked
for
the
first
time
showing
real
interest
she
was
a
pioneer
of
course
before
my
time
i
look
her
up
when
i
get
back
to
the
house
my
people
were
pioneers
they
came
by
panama
in
the
fifties
from
long
island
my
father
was
a
doctor
but
he
went
into
business
in
san
francisco
and
robbed
his
fellow
men
out
of
enough
to
keep
me
and
the
rest
of
a
large
family
going
ever
say
where
are
you
and
your
husband
bound
when
saxon
had
told
him
of
their
attempt
to
get
away
from
oakland
and
of
their
quest
for
land
he
sympathized
with
the
first
and
shook
his
head
over
the
second
it
beautiful
down
beyond
the
sur
he
told
her
i
been
all
over
those
redwood
canyons
and
the
place
is
alive
with
game
the
government
land
is
there
too
but
you
be
foolish
to
settle
it
too
remote
and
it
is
good
farming
land
except
in
patches
in
the
canyons
i
know
a
mexican
there
who
is
wild
to
sell
his
five
hundred
acres
for
fifteen
hundred
dollars
three
dollars
an
acre
and
what
does
that
mean
that
it
is
worth
more
that
it
is
worth
so
much
because
he
can
find
no
takers
land
you
know
is
worth
what
they
buy
and
sell
it
billy
emerging
from
the
thicket
only
in
shoes
and
in
pants
rolled
to
the
knees
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
and
saxon
watched
the
two
men
physically
so
dissimilar
climb
the
rocks
and
start
out
the
south
side
of
the
cove
at
first
her
eyes
followed
them
lazily
but
soon
she
grew
interested
and
worried
hall
was
leading
billy
up
what
seemed
a
perpendicular
wall
in
order
to
gain
the
backbone
of
the
rock
billy
went
slowly
displaying
extreme
caution
but
twice
she
saw
him
slip
the
stone
crumbling
away
in
his
hand
and
rattling
beneath
him
into
the
cove
when
hall
reached
the
top
a
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
she
saw
him
stand
upright
and
sway
easily
on
the
which
she
knew
fell
away
as
abruptly
on
the
other
side
billy
once
on
top
contented
himself
with
crouching
on
hands
and
knees
the
leader
went
on
upright
walking
as
easily
as
on
a
level
floor
billy
abandoned
the
hands
and
knees
position
but
crouched
closely
and
often
helped
himself
with
his
hands
the
backbone
was
deeply
serrated
and
into
one
of
the
notches
both
men
disappeared
saxon
could
not
keep
down
her
anxiety
and
climbed
out
on
the
north
side
of
the
cove
which
was
less
rugged
and
far
less
difficult
to
travel
even
so
the
unaccustomed
height
the
crumbling
surface
and
the
fierce
buffets
of
the
wind
tried
her
nerve
soon
she
was
opposite
the
men
they
had
leaped
a
narrow
chasm
and
were
scaling
another
tooth
already
billy
was
going
more
nimbly
but
his
leader
often
paused
and
waited
for
him
the
way
grew
severer
and
several
times
the
clefts
they
essayed
extended
down
to
the
ocean
level
and
spouted
spray
from
the
growling
breakers
that
burst
through
at
other
times
standing
erect
they
would
fall
forward
across
deep
and
narrow
clefts
until
their
palms
met
the
opposing
side
then
clinging
with
their
fingers
their
bodies
would
be
drawn
across
and
up
near
the
end
hall
and
billy
went
out
of
sight
over
the
south
side
of
the
backbone
and
when
saxon
saw
them
again
they
were
rounding
the
extreme
point
of
rock
and
coming
back
on
the
cove
side
here
the
way
seemed
barred
a
wide
fissure
with
hopelessly
vertical
sides
yawned
skywards
from
a
vortex
where
the
mad
waters
shot
their
level
a
dozen
feet
upward
and
dropped
it
as
abruptly
to
the
black
depths
of
battered
rock
and
writhing
weed
clinging
precariously
the
men
descended
their
side
till
the
spray
was
flying
about
them
here
they
paused
saxon
could
see
hall
pointing
down
across
the
fissure
and
imagined
he
was
showing
some
curious
thing
to
billy
she
was
not
prepared
for
what
followed
the
sucked
and
sank
away
and
across
and
down
hall
jumped
to
a
narrow
foothold
where
the
wash
had
roared
yards
deep
the
moment
before
without
pause
as
the
returning
sea
rushed
up
he
was
around
the
sharp
corner
and
clawing
upward
hand
and
foot
to
escape
being
caught
billy
was
now
left
alone
he
could
not
even
see
hall
much
less
be
further
advised
by
him
and
so
tensely
did
saxon
watch
that
the
pain
in
her
crushed
to
the
rock
by
which
she
held
warned
her
to
relax
billy
waited
his
chance
twice
made
tentative
preparations
to
leap
and
sank
back
then
leaped
across
and
down
to
the
momentarily
exposed
foothold
doubled
the
corner
and
as
he
clawed
up
to
join
hall
was
washed
to
the
waist
but
not
torn
away
saxon
did
not
breathe
easily
till
they
rejoined
her
at
the
fire
one
glance
at
billy
told
her
that
he
was
exceedingly
disgusted
with
himself
you
do
for
a
beginner
hall
cried
slapping
him
jovially
on
the
bare
shoulder
that
climb
is
a
stunt
of
mine
many
the
brave
lad
that
started
with
me
and
broken
down
before
we
were
half
way
out
had
a
dozen
balk
at
that
big
jump
only

athletes

and
then
get
up
and
walk
on
the
parapet
of
a
skyscraper
on
the
lee
side
mind
you
so
that
if
he
blows
off
there
nothing
to
fetch
him
up
but
the
street
he
sprang
that
on
me
did
you
do
it
billy
asked
eagerly
i
would
have
if
i
had
been
on
i
been
practicing
it
secretly
for
a
week
and
i
got
twenty
dollars
out
of
him
on
the
the
tide
was
now
low
enough
for
mussel
gathering
and
saxon
accompanied
the
men
out
the
north
wall
hall
had
several
sacks
to
fill
a
rig
was
coming
for
him
in
the
afternoon
he
explained
to
cart
the
mussels
back
to
carmel
when
the
sacks
were
full
they
ventured
further
among
the
rock
crevices
and
were
rewarded
with
three
abalones
among
the
shells
of
which
saxon
found
one
coveted
hall
initiated
them
into
the
mysteries
of
pounding
and
preparing
the
abalone
meat
for
cooking
by
this
time
it
seemed
to
saxon
that
they
had
known
him
a
long
time
it
reminded
her
of
the
old
times
when
bert
had
been
with
them
singing
his
songs
or
ranting
about
the
last
of
the
mohicans
now
listen
i
going
to
teach
you
something
hall
commanded
a
large
round
rock
poised
in
his
hand
above
the
abalone
meat
you
must
never
never
pound
abalone
without
singing
this
song
nor
must
you
sing
this
song
at
any
other
time
it
would
be
the
rankest
sacrilege
abalone
is
the
food
of
the
gods
its
preparation
is
a
religious
function
now
listen
and
follow
and
remember
that
it
is
a
very
solemn
the
stone
came
down
with
a
thump
on
the
white
meat
and
thereafter
arose
and
fell
in
a
sort
of
accompaniment
to
the
poet
song
oh
some
folks
boast
of
quail
on
toast
because
they
think
it
tony
but
i
content
to
owe
my
rent
and
live
on
abalone
oh
mission
point
a
friendly
joint
where
every
crab
a
crony
and
true
and
kind
you
ever
find
the
clinging
abalone
he
wanders
free
beside
the
sea
where
the
coast
is
stony
he
flaps
his
wings
and
madly
sings
the
plaintive
abalone
some
stick
to
biz
some
flirt
with
liz
down
on
the
sands
of
coney
but
we
by
hell
stay
in
carmel
and
whang
the
he
paused
with
his
mouth
open
and
stone
upraised
there
was
a
rattle
of
wheels
and
a
voice
calling
from
above
where
the
sacks
of
mussels
had
been
carried
he
brought
the
stone
down
with
a
final
thump
and
stood
up
there
a
thousand
more
verses
like
those
he
said
sorry
i
time
to
teach
you
he
held
out
his
hand
palm
downward
and
now
children
bless
you
you
are
now
members
of
the
clan
of
abalone
eaters
and
i
solemnly
enjoin
you
never
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
pound
abalone
meat
without
chanting
the
sacred
words
i
have
revealed
unto
but
we
ca
remember
the
words
from
only
one
hearing
saxon
expostulated
that
shall
be
attended
to
next
sunday
the
tribe
of
abalone
eaters
will
descend
upon
you
here
in
bierce
cove
and
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
rites
the
writers
and
writeresses
down
even
to
the
iron
man
with
the
basilisk
eyes
vulgarly
known
as
the
king
of
the
sacerdotal
will
jim
hazard
come
billy
called
as
hall
disappeared
into
the
thicket
he
will
certainly
come
is
he
not
the
and
gridironer
the
most
fearsome
and
next
to
me
the
most
exalted
of
all
the
abalone
eaters
saxon
and
billy
could
only
look
at
each
other
till
they
heard
the
wheels
rattle
away
well
i
be
doggoned
billy
let
out
he
some
boy
that
nothing
stuck
up
about
him
just
like
jim
hazard
comes
along
and
makes
himself
at
home
you
as
good
as
he
is
an
he
as
good
as
you
an
we
all
friends
together
just
like
that
right
off
the
he
old
stock
too
saxon
said
he
told
me
while
you
were
undressing
his
folks
came
by
panama
before
the
railroad
was
built
and
from
what
he
said
i
guess
he
got
plenty
of
he
sure
do
act
like
and
is
he
full
of
fun
saxon
cried
a
regular
josher
an
him
a
poet
oh
i
do
know
billy
i
heard
that
plenty
of
poets
are
that
right
come
to
think
of
it
there
joaquin
miller
lives
out
in
the
hills
back
of
fruitvale
he
certainly
odd
it
right
near
his
place
where
i
proposed
to
you
just
the
same
i
thought
poets
wore
whiskers
and
eyeglasses
an
never
tripped
up
at
sunday
picnics
nor
run
around
with
as
few
clothes
on
as
the
law
allows
gatherin
mussels
an
climbin
like
that
night
under
the
blankets
saxon
lay
awake
looking
at
the
stars
pleasuring
in
the
balmy
and
listening
to
the
dull
rumble
of
the
outer
surf
and
the
whispering
ripples
on
the
sheltered
beach
a
few
feet
away
billy
stirred
and
she
knew
he
was
not
yet
asleep
glad
you
left
oakland
billy
she
snuggled
huh
came
his
answer
is
a
clam
happy
chapter
viii
every
half
tide
billy
raced
out
the
south
wall
over
the
dangerous
course
he
and
hall
had
traveled
and
each
trial
found
him
doing
it
in
faster
time
wait
till
sunday
he
said
to
saxon
i
give
that
poet
a
run
for
his
money
why
they
ai
a
place
that
bothers
me
now
i
got
the
head
confidence
i
run
where
i
went
on
hands
an
knees
i
figured
it
out
this
way
suppose
you
had
a
foot
to
fall
on
each
side
an
it
was
soft
hay
they
be
nothing
to
stop
you
you
would
fall
you
go
like
a
streak
then
it
just
the
same
if
it
a
mile
down
on
each
side
that
ai
your
concern
your
concern
is
to
stay
on
top
and
go
like
a
streak
an
d
know
saxon
when
i
went
at
it
that
way
it
never
bothered
me
at
all
wait
till
he
comes
with
his
crowd
sunday
i
ready
for
i
wonder
what
the
crowd
will
be
like
saxon
speculated
like
him
of
course
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
they
wo
be
stuck
up
any
of
them
you
hall
had
sent
out
and
a
swimming
suit
by
a
mexican
cowboy
bound
south
to
his
ranch
and
from
the
latter
they
learned
much
of
the
government
land
and
how
to
get
it
the
week
flew
by
each
day
saxon
sighed
a
farewell
of
happiness
to
the
sun
each
morning
they
greeted
its
return
with
laughter
of
joy
in
that
another
happy
day
had
begun
they
made
no
plans
but
fished
gathered
mussels
and
abalones
and
climbed
among
the
rocks
as
the
moment
moved
them
the
abalone
meat
they
pounded
religiously
to
a
verse
of
doggerel
improvised
by
saxon
billy
prospered
saxon
had
never
seen
him
at
so
keen
a
pitch
of
health
as
for
herself
she
scarcely
needed
the
little
to
know
that
never
since
she
was
a
young
girl
had
there
been
such
color
in
her
cheeks
such
spontaneity
of
vivacity
it
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
ever
had
real
play
billy
said
you
an
me
never
played
at
all
all
the
time
we
was
married
this
beats
bein
any
kind
of
a
no
seven
whistle
saxon
exulted
i
lie
abed
in
the
mornings
on
purpose
only
everything
is
too
good
not
to
be
up
and
now
you
just
play
at
chopping
some
firewood
and
catching
a
nice
big
perch
man
friday
if
you
expect
to
get
any
billy
got
up
hatchet
in
hand
from
where
he
had
been
lying
prone
digging
holes
in
the
sand
with
his
bare
toes
but
it
ai
goin
to
last
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh
of
regret
the
rains
come
any
time
now
the
good
weather
hangin
on
something
on
saturday
morning
returning
from
his
run
out
the
south
wall
he
missed
saxon
after
helloing
for
her
without
result
he
climbed
to
the
road
half
a
mile
away
he
saw
her
astride
an
unsaddled
unbridled
horse
that
moved
unwillingly
at
a
slow
walk
across
the
pasture
lucky
for
you
it
was
an
old
mare
that
had
been
used
to
ridin
see
them
saddle
marks
he
grumbled
when
she
at
last
drew
to
a
halt
beside
him
and
allowed
him
to
help
her
down
oh
billy
she
sparkled
i
was
never
on
a
horse
before
it
was
glorious
i
felt
so
helpless
too
and
so
i
proud
of
you
just
the
same
he
said
in
more
grumbling
tones
than
before
every
married
woman
tackle
a
strange
horse
that
way
especially
if
she
never
ben
on
one
an
i
ai
forgot
that
goin
to
have
a
saddle
animal
all
to
yourself
some
day
a
regular
joe
the
abalone
eaters
in
two
rigs
and
on
a
number
of
horses
descended
in
force
on
bierce
cove
there
were
half
a
score
of
men
and
almost
as
many
women
all
were
young
between
the
ages
of
and
forty
and
all
seemed
good
friends
most
of
them
were
married
they
arrived
in
a
roar
of
good
spirits
tripping
one
another
down
the
slippery
trail
and
engulfing
saxon
and
billy
in
a
comradeship
as
artless
and
warm
as
the
sunshine
itself
saxon
was
appropriated
by
the
girls
she
could
not
realize
them
women
and
they
made
much
of
her
praising
her
camping
and
traveling
equipment
and
insisting
on
hearing
some
of
her
tale
they
were
experienced
campers
themselves
as
she
quickly
discovered
when
she
saw
the
pots
and
pans
and
for
the
mussels
which
they
had
brought
in
the
meantime
billy
and
the
men
had
undressed
and
scattered
out
after
mussels
and
abalones
the
girls
lighted
on
saxon
ukulele
and
nothing
would
do
but
she
must
play
and
sing
several
of
them
had
been
to
honolulu
and
knew
the
instrument
confirming
mercedes
definition
of
ukulele
as
jumping
also
they
knew
hawaiian
songs
she
had
learned
from
mercedes
and
soon
to
her
accompaniment
all
were
singing
aloha
oe
honolulu
tomboy
and
sweet
lei
saxon
was
genuinely
shocked
when
some
of
them
even
the
more
matronly
danced
hulas
on
the
sand
when
the
men
returned
burdened
with
sacks
of
shellfish
mark
hall
as
high
priest
commanded
the
due
and
solemn
rite
of
the
tribe
at
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
many
poised
stones
came
down
in
unison
on
the
white
meat
and
all
voices
were
uplifted
in
the
hymn
to
the
abalone
old
verses
all
sang
occasionally
some
one
sang
a
fresh
verse
alone
whereupon
it
was
repeated
in
chorus
billy
betrayed
saxon
by
begging
her
in
an
undertone
to
sing
the
verse
she
had
made
and
her
pretty
voice
was
timidly
raised
in
we
sit
around
and
gaily
pound
and
bear
no
acrimony
because
our
ob
ject
is
a
gob
of
sizzling
great
cried
the
poet
who
had
winced
at
ob
ject
she
speaks
the
language
of
the
tribe
come
on
children
now
and
all
chanted
saxon
lines
then
jim
hazard
had
a
new
verse
and
one
of
the
girls
and
the
iron
man
with
the
basilisk
eyes
of
whom
saxon
recognized
from
hall
description
to
her
it
seemed
he
had
the
face
of
a
priest
oh
some
like
ham
and
some
like
lamb
and
some
like
macaroni
but
bring
me
in
a
pail
of
gin
and
a
tub
of
abalone
oh
some
drink
rain
and
some
champagne
or
brandy
by
the
pony
but
i
will
try
a
little
rye
with
a
dash
of
abalone
some
live
on
hope
and
some
on
dope
and
some
on
alimony
but
our
he
lives
on
fat
and
tender
a
man
with
the
roguish
face
of
a
satyr
who
saxon
learned
was
an
artist
who
sold
his
paintings
at
five
hundred
apiece
brought
on
himself
universal
execration
and
acclamation
by
singing
the
more
we
take
the
more
they
make
in
deep
sea
matrimony
race
suicide
can
not
betide
the
fertile
and
so
it
went
verses
new
and
old
verses
without
end
all
in
glorification
of
the
succulent
shellfish
of
carmel
saxon
enjoyment
was
keen
almost
ecstatic
and
she
had
difficulty
in
convincing
herself
of
the
reality
of
it
all
it
seemed
like
some
fairy
tale
or
book
story
come
true
again
it
seemed
more
like
a
stage
and
these
the
actors
she
and
billy
having
blundered
into
the
scene
in
some
incomprehensible
way
much
of
wit
she
sensed
which
she
did
not
understand
much
she
did
understand
and
she
was
aware
that
brains
were
playing
as
she
had
never
seen
brains
play
before
the
puritan
streak
in
her
training
was
astonished
and
shocked
by
some
of
the
broadness
but
she
refused
to
sit
in
judgment
they
seemed
good
these
young
people
they
certainly
were
not
rough
or
gross
as
were
many
of
the
crowds
she
had
been
with
on
sunday
picnics
none
of
the
men
got
drunk
although
there
were
cocktails
in
vacuum
bottles
and
red
wine
in
a
huge
demijohn
what
impressed
saxon
most
was
their
excessive
jollity
their
childlike
joy
and
the
childlike
things
they
did
this
effect
was
heightened
by
the
fact
that
they
were
novelists
and
painters
poets
and
critics
sculptors
and
musicians
one
man
with
a
refined
and
delicate
face
a
dramatic
critic
on
a
great
san
francisco
daily
she
was
told
introduced
a
feat
which
all
the
men
tried
and
failed
at
most
ludicrously
on
the
beach
at
regular
intervals
planks
were
placed
as
obstacles
then
the
dramatic
critic
on
all
fours
galloped
along
the
sand
for
all
the
world
like
a
horse
and
for
all
the
world
like
a
horse
taking
hurdles
he
jumped
the
planks
to
the
end
of
the
course
quoits
had
been
brought
along
and
for
a
while
these
were
pitched
with
zest
then
jumping
was
started
and
game
slid
into
game
billy
took
part
in
everything
but
did
not
win
first
place
as
often
as
he
had
expected
an
english
writer
beat
him
a
dozen
feet
at
tossing
the
caber
jim
hazard
beat
him
in
putting
the
heavy
mark
hall
him
standing
and
running
but
at
the
standing
high
billy
did
come
first
despite
the
handicap
of
his
weight
this
victory
was
due
to
his
splendid
back
and
abdominal
lifting
muscles
immediately
after
this
however
he
was
brought
to
grief
by
mark
hall
sister
a
strapping
young
amazon
in
riding
costume
who
three
times
tumbled
him
ignominiously
heels
over
head
in
a
bout
of
indian
wrestling
you
easy
jeered
the
iron
man
whose
name
they
had
learned
was
pete
bideaux
i
can
put
you
down
myself
billy
accepted
the
challenge
and
found
in
all
truth
that
the
other
was
rightly
nicknamed
in
the
training
camps
billy
had
sparred
and
clinched
with
giant
champions
like
jim
jeffries
and
jack
johnson
and
met
the
weight
of
their
strength
but
never
had
he
encountered
strength
like
this
of
the
iron
man
do
what
he
could
billy
was
powerless
and
twice
his
shoulders
were
ground
into
the
sand
in
defeat
you
get
a
chance
back
at
him
hazard
whispered
to
billy
off
at
one
side
i
brought
the
gloves
along
of
course
you
had
no
chance
with
him
at
his
own
game
he
wrestled
in
the
music
halls
in
london
with
hackenschmidt
now
you
keep
quiet
and
we
lead
up
to
it
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
he
does
know
about
soon
the
englishman
who
had
tossed
the
caber
was
sparring
with
the
dramatic
critic
hazard
and
hall
boxed
in
fantastic
burlesque
then
gloves
in
hand
looked
for
the
next
appropriately
matched
couple
the
choice
of
bideaux
and
billy
was
obvious
he
liable
to
get
nasty
if
he
hurt
hazard
warned
billy
as
he
tied
on
the
gloves
for
him
he
old
american
french
and
he
got
a
devil
of
a
temper
but
just
keep
your
head
and
tap
him
whatever
you
do
keep
tapping
easy
sparring
now
no
roughhouse
bideaux
just
light
tapping
you
know
were
admonitions
variously
addressed
to
the
iron
man
hold
on
a
second
he
said
to
billy
dropping
his
hands
when
i
get
rapped
i
do
get
a
bit
hot
but
do
mind
me
i
ca
help
it
you
know
it
only
for
the
moment
and
i
do
mean
saxon
felt
very
nervous
visions
of
billy
bloody
fights
and
all
the
scabs
he
had
slugged
rising
in
her
brain
but
she
had
never
seen
her
husband
box
and
but
few
seconds
were
required
to
put
her
at
ease
the
iron
man
had
no
chance
billy
was
too
completely
the
master
guarding
every
blow
himself
continually
and
almost
at
will
tapping
the
face
and
body
there
was
no
weight
in
billy
blows
only
a
light
and
snappy
tingle
but
their
incessant
iteration
told
on
the
iron
temper
in
vain
the
onlookers
warned
him
to
go
easy
his
face
purpled
with
anger
and
his
blows
became
savage
but
billy
went
on
tap
tap
tap
calmly
gently
imperturbably
the
iron
man
lost
control
and
rushed
and
plunged
delivering
great
swings
and
of
quality
billy
ducked
blocked
stalled
and
escaped
all
damage
in
the
clinches
which
were
unavoidable
he
locked
the
iron
man
arms
and
in
the
clinches
the
iron
man
invariably
laughed
and
apologized
only
to
lose
his
head
with
the
first
tap
the
instant
they
separated
and
be
more
infuriated
than
ever
and
when
it
was
over
and
billy
identity
had
been
divulged
the
iron
man
accepted
the
joke
on
himself
with
the
best
of
humor
it
had
been
a
splendid
exhibition
on
billy
part
his
mastery
of
the
sport
coupled
with
his
had
most
favorably
impressed
the
crowd
and
saxon
very
proud
of
her
man
boy
could
not
but
see
the
admiration
all
had
for
him
nor
did
she
prove
in
any
way
a
social
failure
when
the
tired
and
sweating
players
lay
down
in
the
dry
sand
to
cool
off
she
was
persuaded
into
accompanying
their
nonsense
songs
with
the
ukulele
nor
was
it
long
catching
their
spirit
ere
she
was
singing
to
them
and
teaching
them
quaint
songs
of
early
days
which
she
had
herself
learned
as
a
little
girl
from
cady
cady
the
saloonkeeper
pioneer
and
who
had
been
a
on
the
salt
intake
trail
in
the
days
before
the
railroad
one
song
which
became
an
immediate
favorite
was
oh
times
on
bitter
creek
they
never
can
be
beat
root
hog
or
die
is
on
every
wagon
sheet
the
sand
within
your
throat
the
dust
within
your
eye
bend
your
back
and
stand
it
root

or
after
the
dozen
verses
of
root
hog
or
die
mark
hall
claimed
to
be
especially
infatuated
with
obadier
he
dreampt
a
dream
dreampt
he
was
drivin
a
team
but
when
he
woke
he
heaved
a
sigh
the
kicked
the
it
was
mark
hall
who
brought
up
the
matter
of
billy
challenge
to
race
out
the
south
wall
of
the
cove
though
he
referred
to
the
test
as
lying
somewhere
in
the
future
billy
surprised
him
by
saying
he
was
ready
at
any
time
forthwith
the
crowd
clamored
for
the
race
hall
offered
to
bet
on
himself
but
there
were
no
takers
he
offered
two
to
one
to
jim
hazard
who
shook
his
head
and
said
he
would
accept
three
to
one
as
a
sporting
proposition
billy
heard
and
gritted
his
teeth
i
take
you
for
five
dollars
he
said
to
hall
but
not
at
those
odds
i
back
myself
it
is
your
money
i
want
it
hazard
hall
demurred
though
give
either
of
you
three
to
even
or
nothing
billy
held
out
obstinately
hall
finally
closed
both
bets
even
with
billy
and
three
to
one
with
hazard
the
path
along
the
was
so
narrow
that
it
was
impossible
for
runners
to
pass
each
other
so
it
was
arranged
to
time
the
men
hall
to
go
first
and
billy
to
follow
after
an
interval
of
half
a
minute
hall
toed
the
mark
and
at
the
word
was
off
with
the
form
of
a
sprinter
saxon
heart
sank
she
knew
billy
had
never
crossed
the
stretch
of
sand
at
that
speed
billy
darted
forward
thirty
seconds
later
and
reached
the
foot
of
the
rock
when
hall
was
half
way
up
when
both
were
on
top
and
racing
from
notch
to
notch
the
iron
man
announced
that
they
had
scaled
the
wall
in
the
same
time
to
a
second
my
money
still
looks
good
hazard
remarked
though
i
hope
neither
of
them
breaks
a
neck
i
would
take
that
run
that
way
for
all
the
gold
that
would
fill
the
but
you
take
bigger
chances
swimming
in
a
storm
on
carmel
beach
his
wife
chided
oh
i
do
know
he
retorted
you
have
so
far
to
fall
when
billy
and
hall
had
disappeared
and
were
making
the
circle
around
the
end
those
on
the
beach
were
certain
that
the
poet
had
gained
in
the
dizzy
spurts
of
flight
along
the
even
hazard
admitted
it
what
price
for
my
money
now
he
cried
excitedly
dancing
up
and
down
hall
had
reappeared
the
great
jump
accomplished
and
was
running
shoreward
but
there
was
no
gap
billy
was
on
his
heels
and
on
his
heels
he
stayed
in
to
shore
down
the
wall
and
to
the
mark
on
the
beach
billy
had
won
by
half
a
minute
only
by
the
watch
he
panted
hall
was
over
half
a
minute
ahead
of
me
out
to
the
end
i
not
slower
than
i
thought
but
he
faster
a
wooz
of
a
sprinter
he
could
beat
me
ten
times
outa
ten
except
for
accident
he
was
hung
up
at
the
jump
by
a
big
sea
that
where
i
caught
i
jumped
right
after
on
the
same
sea
then
he
set
the
pace
home
and
all
i
had
to
do
was
take
that
all
right
said
hall
you
did
better
than
beat
me
that
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
bierce
cove
that
two
men
made
that
jump
on
the
same
sea
and
all
the
risk
was
yours
coming
it
was
a
fluke
billy
insisted
and
at
that
point
saxon
settled
the
dispute
of
modesty
and
raised
a
general
laugh
by
rippling
chords
on
the
ukulele
and
parodying
an
old
hymn
in
negro
minstrel
fashion
de
lawd
move
in
er
mischievous
way
his
blunders
to
in
the
afternoon
jim
hazard
and
hall
dived
into
the
breakers
and
swam
to
the
outlying
rocks
routing
the
protesting
and
taking
possession
of
their
stronghold
billy
followed
the
swimmers
with
his
eyes
yearning
after
them
so
undisguisedly
that
mrs
hazard
said
to
him
why
do
you
stop
in
carmel
this
winter
jim
will
teach
you
all
he
knows
about
the
surf
and
he
wild
to
box
with
you
he
works
long
hours
at
his
desk
and
he
really
needs
not
until
sunset
did
the
merry
crowd
carry
their
pots
and
pans
and
trove
of
mussels
up
to
the
road
and
depart
saxon
and
billy
watched
them
disappear
on
horses
and
behind
horses
over
the
top
of
the
first
hill
and
then
descended
hand
in
hand
through
the
thicket
to
the
camp
billy
threw
himself
on
the
sand
and
stretched
out
i
do
know
when
i
been
so
tired
he
yawned
an
there
one
thing
sure
i
never
had
such
a
day
it
worth
livin
twenty
years
for
an
then
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
saxon
who
lay
beside
him
and
oh
i
was
so
proud
of
you
billy
she
said
i
never
saw
you
box
before
i
did
know
it
was
like
that
the
iron
man
was
at
your
mercy
all
the
time
and
you
kept
it
from
being
violent
or
terrible
everybody
could
look
on
and
enjoy
and
they
did
huh
i
want
to
say
you
was
goin
some
yourself
they
just
took
to
you
why
honest
to
god
saxon
in
the
singin
you
was
the
whole
show
along
with
the
ukulele
all
the
women
liked
you
too
an
that
what
it
was
their
first
social
triumph
and
the
taste
of
it
was
sweet
mr
hall
said
he
looked
up
the
of
the
files
saxon
recounted
and
he
said
mother
was
a
true
poet
he
said
it
was
astonishing
the
fine
stock
that
had
crossed
the
plains
he
told
me
a
lot
about
those
times
and
the
people
i
did
know
and
he
read
all
about
the
fight
at
little
meadow
he
says
he
got
it
in
a
book
at
home
and
if
we
come
back
to
carmel
he
show
it
to
he
wants
us
to
come
back
all
right
d
know
what
he
said
to
me
saxon
he
gave
me
a
letter
to
some
guy
that
down
on
the
government
land
some
poet
that
holdin
down
a
quarter
of
a
section
so
we
be
able
to
stop
there
which
come
in
handy
if
the
big
rains
catch
us
an
oh
that
what
i
was
drivin
at
he
said
he
had
a
little
shack
he
lived
in
while
the
house
was
buildin
the
iron
man
livin
in
it
now
but
he
goin
away
to
some
catholic
college
to
study
to
be
a
priest
an
hall
said
the
shack
be
ours
as
long
as
we
wanted
to
use
it
an
he
said
i
could
do
what
the
iron
man
was
doin
to
make
a
livin
hall
was
kind
of
bashful
when
he
was
offerin
me
work
said
it
be
only
odd
jobs
but
that
we
make
out
i
could
help
plant
potatoes
he
said
an
he
got
half
savage
when
he
said
i
could
chop
wood
that
was
his
job
he
said
an
you
could
see
he
was
actually
jealous
over
and
hall
said
just
about
the
same
to
me
billy
carmel
would
be
so
bad
to
pass
the
rainy
season
in
and
then
too
you
could
go
swimming
with
seems
as
if
we
could
settle
down
wherever
we
a
mind
to
billy
assented
carmel
the
third
place
now
that
offered
well
after
this
no
man
need
be
afraid
of
makin
a
go
in
the
no
good
man
saxon
corrected
i
guess
you
billy
thought
for
a
moment
just
the
same
a
dub
too
has
a
better
chance
in
the
country
than
in
the
who
have
ever
thought
that
such
fine
people
existed
saxon
pondered
it
just
wonderful
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
only
what
you
expect
from
a
rich
poet
that
trip
up
a
at
an
irish
picnic
billy
exposited
the
only
crowd
such
a
guy
run
with
would
be
like
himself
or
make
a
crowd
that
was
i
would
wonder
that
he
make
this
crowd
say
he
got
some
sister
if
anybody
ride
up
on
a
an
ask
you
she
got
that
indian
wrestlin
down
pat
an
she
built
for
it
say
ai
his
wife
a
beaut
a
little
longer
they
lay
in
the
warm
sand
it
was
billy
who
broke
the
silence
and
what
he
said
seemed
to
proceed
out
of
profound
meditation
say
saxon
d
know
i
do
care
if
i
never
see
movie
pictures
chapter
ix
saxon
and
billy
were
gone
weeks
on
the
trip
south
but
in
the
end
they
came
back
to
carmel
they
had
stopped
with
hafler
the
poet
in
the
marble
house
which
he
had
built
with
his
own
hands
this
queer
dwelling
was
all
in
one
room
built
almost
entirely
of
white
marble
hafler
cooked
as
over
a
campfire
in
the
huge
marble
fireplace
which
he
used
in
all
ways
as
a
kitchen
there
were
divers
shelves
of
books
and
the
massive
furniture
he
had
made
from
redwood
as
he
had
made
the
shakes
for
the
roof
a
blanket
stretched
across
a
corner
gave
saxon
privacy
the
poet
was
on
the
verge
of
departing
for
san
francisco
and
new
york
but
remained
a
day
over
with
them
to
explain
the
country
and
run
over
the
government
land
with
billy
saxon
had
wanted
to
go
along
that
morning
but
hafler
scornfully
rejected
her
telling
her
that
her
legs
were
too
short
that
night
when
the
men
returned
billy
was
played
out
to
exhaustion
he
frankly
acknowledged
that
hafler
had
walked
him
into
the
ground
and
that
his
tongue
had
been
hanging
out
from
the
first
hour
hafler
estimated
that
they
had
covered
miles
but
such
miles
billy
enlarged
half
the
time
up
or
down
an
all
the
time
without
trails
an
such
a
pace
he
was
dead
right
about
your
short
legs
saxon
you
would
the
first
mile
an
such
country
we
ai
seen
anything
like
it
hafler
left
the
next
day
to
catch
the
train
at
monterey
he
gave
them
the
freedom
of
the
marble
house
and
told
them
to
stay
the
whole
winter
if
they
wanted
billy
elected
to
loaf
around
and
rest
up
that
day
he
was
stiff
and
sore
moreover
he
was
stunned
by
the
exhibition
of
walking
prowess
on
the
part
of
the
poet
everybody
can
do
something
down
in
this
country
he
marveled
now
take
that
hafler
he
a
bigger
man
than
me
an
a
heavier
an
weight
against
walkin
too
but
not
with
him
he
done
eighty
miles
inside
hours
he
told
me
an
once
a
hundred
an
seventy
in
three
days
why
he
made
a
show
outa
me
i
felt
ashamed
as
a
little
remember
billy
saxon
soothed
him
every
man
to
his
own
game
and
down
here
you
a
at
your
own
game
there
is
one
not
the
master
of
with
the
i
guess
that
right
he
conceded
but
just
the
same
it
goes
against
the
grain
to
be
walked
off
my
legs
by
a
poet
by
a
poet
mind
they
spent
days
in
going
over
the
government
land
and
in
the
end
reluctantly
decided
against
taking
it
up
the
redwood
canyons
and
great
cliffs
of
the
santa
lucia
mountains
fascinated
saxon
but
she
remembered
what
hafler
had
told
her
of
the
summer
fogs
which
hid
the
sun
sometimes
for
a
week
or
two
at
a
time
and
which
lingered
for
months
then
too
there
was
no
access
to
market
it
was
many
miles
to
where
the
nearest
wagon
road
began
at
post
and
from
there
on
past
point
sur
to
carmel
it
was
a
weary
and
perilous
way
billy
with
his
teamster
judgment
admitted
that
for
heavy
hauling
it
was
anything
but
a
picnic
there
was
the
quarry
of
perfect
marble
on
hafler
quarter
section
he
had
said
that
it
would
be
worth
a
fortune
if
near
a
railroad
but
as
it
was
he
make
them
a
present
of
it
if
they
wanted
it
billy
visioned
the
grassy
slopes
pastured
with
his
horses
and
cattle
and
found
it
hard
to
turn
his
back
but
he
listened
with
a
willing
ear
to
saxon
argument
in
favor
of
a
like
the
one
they
had
seen
in
the
moving
pictures
in
oakland
yes
he
agreed
what
they
wanted
was
an
farm
and
an
farm
they
would
have
if
they
hiked
forty
years
to
find
it
but
it
must
have
redwoods
on
it
saxon
hastened
to
stipulate
fallen
in
love
with
them
and
we
can
get
along
without
fog
and
there
must
be
good
and
a
railroad
not
more
than
a
thousand
miles
heavy
winter
rains
held
them
prisoners
for
two
weeks
in
the
marble
house
saxon
browsed
among
hafler
books
though
most
of
them
were
depressingly
beyond
her
while
billy
hunted
with
hafler
guns
but
he
was
a
poor
shot
and
a
worse
hunter
his
only
success
was
with
rabbits
which
he
managed
to
kill
on
occasions
when
they
stood
still
with
the
rifle
he
got
nothing
although
he
fired
at
half
a
dozen
different
deer
and
once
at
a
huge
with
a
long
tail
which
he
was
certain
was
a
mountain
lion
despite
the
way
he
grumbled
at
himself
saxon
could
see
the
keen
joy
he
was
taking
this
belated
arousal
of
the
hunting
instinct
seemed
to
make
almost
another
man
of
him
he
was
out
early
and
late
compassing
prodigious
climbs
and
tramps
once
reaching
as
far
as
the
gold
mines
tom
had
spoken
of
and
being
away
two
days
talk
about
pluggin
away
at
a
job
in
the
city
an
goin
to
pictures
and
sunday
picnics
for
amusement
he
would
burst
out
i
see
what
was
eatin
me
that
i
ever
put
up
with
such
truck
here
where
i
oughta
ben
all
the
time
or
some
place
like
he
was
filled
with
this
new
mode
of
life
and
was
continually
recalling
old
hunting
tales
of
his
father
and
telling
them
to
saxon
say
i
do
get
stiffened
any
more
after
an
tramp
he
exulted
i
broke
in
an
some
day
if
i
meet
up
with
that
hafler
i
challenge
to
a
tramp
that
break
his
foolish
boy
always
wanting
to
play
everybody
game
and
beat
them
at
it
saxon
laughed
delightedly
aw
i
guess
you
right
he
growled
hafler
can
always
me
he
made
that
way
but
some
day
just
the
same
if
i
ever
see
again
i
invite
to
put
on
the
though
i
wo
be
mean
enough
to
make
as
sore
as
he
made
after
they
left
post
on
the
way
back
to
carmel
the
condition
of
the
road
proved
the
wisdom
of
their
rejection
of
the
government
land
they
passed
a
rancher
wagon
overturned
a
second
wagon
with
a
broken
axle
and
the
stage
a
hundred
yards
down
the
mountainside
where
it
had
fallen
passengers
horses
road
and
all
i
guess
they
just
about
quit
tryin
to
use
this
road
in
the
winter
billy
said
it
an
an
i
can
just
see
freightin
that
marble
out
over
it
i
do
settling
down
at
carmel
was
an
easy
matter
the
iron
man
had
already
departed
to
his
catholic
college
and
the
shack
turned
out
to
be
a
house
comfortably
furnished
for
housekeeping
hall
put
billy
to
work
on
the
potato
patch
a
matter
of
three
acres
which
the
poet
farmed
erratically
to
the
huge
delight
of
his
crowd
he
planted
at
all
seasons
and
it
was
accepted
by
the
community
that
what
did
not
rot
in
the
ground
was
evenly
divided
between
the
gophers
and
trespassing
cows
a
plow
was
borrowed
a
team
of
horses
hired
and
billy
took
hold
also
he
built
a
fence
around
the
patch
and
after
that
was
set
to
staining
the
shingled
roof
of
the
bungalow
hall
climbed
to
the
to
repeat
his
warning
that
billy
must
keep
away
from
his
one
morning
hall
came
over
and
watched
billy
chopping
wood
for
saxon
the
poet
looked
on
covetously
as
long
as
he
could
restrain
himself
it
plain
you
do
know
how
to
use
an
axe
he
sneered
here
let
me
show
he
worked
away
for
an
hour
all
the
while
delivering
an
exposition
on
the
art
of
chopping
wood
here
billy
expostulated
at
last
taking
hold
of
the
axe
i
have
to
chop
a
cord
of
yours
now
in
order
to
make
this
up
to
hall
surrendered
the
axe
reluctantly
do
let
me
catch
you
around
my
that
all
he
threatened
my
is
my
castle
and
you
got
to
understand
from
a
financial
standpoint
saxon
and
billy
were
putting
aside
much
money
they
paid
no
rent
their
simple
living
was
cheap
and
billy
had
all
the
work
he
cared
to
accept
the
various
members
of
the
crowd
seemed
in
a
conspiracy
to
keep
him
busy
it
was
all
odd
jobs
but
he
preferred
it
so
for
it
enabled
him
to
suit
his
time
to
jim
hazard
each
day
they
boxed
and
took
a
long
swim
through
the
surf
when
hazard
finished
his
morning
writing
he
would
whoop
through
the
pines
to
billy
who
dropped
whatever
work
he
was
doing
after
the
swim
they
would
take
a
fresh
shower
at
hazard
house
rub
each
other
down
in
training
camp
style
and
be
ready
for
the
noon
meal
in
the
afternoon
hazard
returned
to
his
desk
and
billy
to
his
outdoor
work
although
still
later
they
often
met
for
a
few
miles
run
over
the
hills
training
was
a
matter
of
habit
to
both
men
hazard
when
he
had
finished
with
seven
years
of
football
knowing
the
dire
death
that
awaits
the
athlete
who
ceases
training
abruptly
had
been
compelled
to
keep
it
up
not
only
was
it
a
necessity
but
he
had
grown
to
like
it
billy
also
liked
it
for
he
took
great
delight
in
the
silk
of
his
body
often
in
the
early
morning
gun
in
hand
he
was
off
with
mark
hall
who
taught
him
to
shoot
and
hunt
hall
had
dragged
a
shotgun
around
from
the
days
when
he
wore
knee
pants
and
his
keen
observing
eyes
and
knowledge
of
the
habits
of
wild
life
were
a
revelation
to
billy
this
part
of
the
country
was
too
settled
for
large
game
but
billy
kept
saxon
supplied
with
squirrels
and
quail
cottontails
and
jackrabbits
snipe
and
wild
ducks
and
they
learned
to
eat
roasted
mallard
and
canvasback
in
the
california
style
of
sixteen
minutes
in
a
hot
oven
as
he
became
expert
with
shotgun
and
rifle
he
began
to
regret
the
deer
and
the
mountain
lion
he
had
missed
down
below
the
sur
and
to
the
requirements
of
the
farm
he
and
saxon
sought
he
added
plenty
of
game
but
it
was
not
all
play
in
carmel
that
portion
of
the
community
which
saxon
and
billy
came
to
know
the
crowd
was
some
worked
regularly
in
the
morning
or
late
at
night
others
worked
spasmodically
like
the
wild
irish
playwright
who
would
shut
himself
up
for
a
week
at
a
time
then
emerge
pale
and
drawn
to
play
like
a
madman
against
the
time
of
his
next
retirement
the
pale
and
youthful
father
of
a
family
with
the
face
of
shelley
who
wrote
vaudeville
turns
for
a
living
and
blank
verse
tragedies
and
sonnet
cycles
for
the
despair
of
managers
and
publishers
hid
himself
in
a
concrete
cell
with
walls
so
piped
that
by
turning
a
lever
the
whole
structure
spouted
water
upon
the
impending
intruder
but
in
the
main
they
respected
each
they
drifted
into
one
another
houses
as
the
spirit
prompted
but
if
they
found
a
man
at
work
they
went
their
way
this
obtained
to
all
except
mark
hall
who
did
not
have
to
work
for
a
living
and
he
climbed
trees
to
get
away
from
popularity
and
compose
in
peace
the
crowd
was
unique
in
its
democracy
and
solidarity
it
had
little
intercourse
with
the
sober
and
conventional
part
of
carmel
this
section
constituted
the
aristocracy
of
art
and
letters
and
was
sneered
at
as
bourgeois
in
return
it
looked
askance
at
the
crowd
with
its
rampant
bohemianism
the
taboo
extended
to
billy
and
saxon
billy
took
up
the
attitude
of
the
clan
and
sought
no
work
from
the
other
camp
nor
was
work
offered
him
hall
kept
open
house
the
big
living
room
with
its
huge
fireplace
divans
shelves
and
tables
of
books
and
magazines
was
the
center
of
things
here
billy
and
saxon
were
expected
to
be
and
in
truth
found
themselves
to
be
as
much
at
home
as
anybody
here
when
wordy
discussions
on
all
subjects
under
the
sun
were
not
being
waged
billy
played
at
pedro
horrible
fives
bridge
and
pinochle
saxon
a
favorite
of
the
young
women
sewed
with
them
teaching
them
pretties
and
being
taught
in
fair
measure
in
return
it
was
billy
before
they
had
been
in
carmel
a
week
who
said
shyly
to
saxon
say
you
ca
guess
how
i
missin
all
your
nice
things
the
matter
with
writin
tom
to
express
down
when
we
start
again
we
express
saxon
wrote
the
letter
and
all
that
day
her
heart
was
singing
her
man
was
still
her
lover
and
there
were
in
his
eyes
all
the
old
lights
which
had
been
blotted
out
during
the
nightmare
period
of
the
strike
some
pretty
nifty
skirts
around
here
but
you
got
all
beat
or
i
no
judge
he
told
her
and
again
oh
i
love
you
to
death
anyway
but
if
them
things
ai
shipped
down
there
be
a
hall
and
his
wife
owned
a
pair
of
saddle
horses
which
were
kept
at
the
livery
stable
and
here
billy
naturally
gravitated
the
stable
operated
the
stage
and
carried
the
mails
between
carmel
and
monterey
also
it
rented
out
carriages
and
mountain
wagons
that
seated
nine
persons
with
carriages
and
wagons
a
driver
was
furnished
the
stable
often
found
itself
short
a
driver
and
billy
was
quickly
called
upon
he
became
an
extra
man
at
the
stable
he
received
three
dollars
a
day
at
such
times
and
drove
many
parties
around
the
seventeen
mile
drive
up
carmel
valley
and
down
the
coast
to
the
various
points
and
beaches
but
they
a
pretty
uppish
sort
most
of
he
said
to
saxon
referring
to
the
persons
he
drove
always
mister
roberts
this
mister
roberts
that
all
kinds
of
ceremony
so
as
to
make
me
not
forget
they
consider
themselves
better
me
you
see
i
ai
exactly
a
servant
an
yet
i
ai
good
enough
for
them
i
the
driver
something
half
way
between
a
hired
man
and
a
chauffeur
huh
when
they
eat
they
give
me
my
lunch
off
to
one
side
or
afterward
no
family
party
like
with
hall
an
his
kind
an
that
crowd
why
they
just
naturally
did
have
no
lunch
for
me
at
all
after
this
always
you
make
me
up
my
own
lunch
i
wo
be
be
holdin
to
for
nothin
the
damned
geezers
an
you
to
seen
one
of
try
to
give
me
a
tip
i
did
say
nothin
i
just
looked
at
like
i
did
see
an
turned
away
after
a
moment
leavin
him
as
embarrassed
as
nevertheless
billy
enjoyed
the
driving
never
more
so
than
when
he
held
the
reins
not
of
four
plodding
workhorses
but
of
four
fast
driving
animals
his
foot
on
the
powerful
brake
and
swung
around
curves
and
along
dizzy
to
a
frightened
chorus
of
women
passengers
and
when
it
came
to
horse
judgment
and
treatment
of
sick
and
injured
horses
even
the
owner
of
the
stable
yielded
place
to
billy
i
could
get
a
regular
job
there
any
time
he
boasted
quietly
to
saxon
why
the
country
just
sproutin
with
jobs
for
any
sort
of
a
fellow
i
bet
anything
right
now
if
i
said
to
the
boss
that
take
sixty
dollars
an
work
regular
he
jump
for
me
he
hinted
as
and
say
are
you
onta
the
fact
that
yours
truly
has
learnt
a
new
trade
well
he
has
he
could
take
a
job
anywheres
they
drive
six
on
some
of
the
stages
up
in
lake
county
if
we
ever
get
there
i
get
thick
with
some
driver
just
to
get
the
reins
of
six
in
my
hands
an
i
have
you
on
the
box
beside
me
some
goin
that
some
goin
billy
took
little
interest
in
the
many
discussions
waged
in
hall
big
living
room
was
his
term
for
it
to
him
it
was
so
much
good
time
wasted
that
might
be
employed
at
a
game
of
pedro
or
going
swimming
or
wrestling
in
the
sand
saxon
on
the
contrary
delighted
in
the
logomachy
though
little
enough
she
understood
of
it
following
mainly
by
feeling
and
once
in
a
while
catching
a
high
light
but
what
she
could
never
comprehend
was
the
pessimism
that
so
often
cropped
up
the
wild
irish
playwright
had
terrible
spells
of
depression
shelley
who
wrote
vaudeville
turns
in
the
concrete
cell
was
a
chronic
pessimist
john
a
young
magazine
writer
was
an
anarchic
disciple
of
nietzsche
masson
a
painter
held
to
a
doctrine
of
eternal
recurrence
that
was
petrifying
and
hall
usually
so
merry
could
outfoot
them
all
when
he
once
got
started
on
the
cosmic
pathos
of
religion
and
the
gibbering
anthropomorphisms
of
those
who
loved
not
to
die
at
such
times
saxon
was
oppressed
by
these
sad
children
of
art
it
was
inconceivable
that
they
of
all
people
should
be
so
forlorn
one
night
hall
turned
suddenly
upon
billy
who
had
been
following
dimly
and
who
only
comprehended
that
to
them
everything
in
life
was
rotten
and
wrong
here
you
pagan
you
you
stolid
and
ox
you
monstrosity
of
and
perennial
health
and
joy
what
do
you
think
of
it
hall
demanded
oh
i
had
my
troubles
billy
answered
speaking
in
his
wonted
slow
way
i
had
my
hard
times
an
fought
a
losin
strike
an
soaked
my
watch
an
ben
unable
to
pay
my
rent
or
buy
grub
an
slugged
scabs
ben
slugged
and
ben
thrown
into
jail
for
makin
a
fool
of
myself
if
i
get
you
i
be
a
whole
lot
better
to
be
a
swell
hog
fattenin
for
market
an
nothin
worryin
than
to
be
a
guy
sick
to
his
stomach
from
not
savvyin
how
the
world
is
made
or
from
wonderin
what
the
good
of
that
good
that
prize
hog
the
poet
laughed
least
irritation
least
effort
a
compromise
of
nirvana
and
life
least
irritation
least
effort
the
ideal
existence
a
jellyfish
floating
in
a
tideless
tepid
twilight
but
you
missin
all
the
good
things
billy
objected
name
them
came
the
challenge
billy
was
silent
a
moment
to
him
life
seemed
a
large
and
generous
thing
he
felt
as
if
his
arms
ached
from
inability
to
compass
it
all
and
he
began
haltingly
at
first
to
put
his
feeling
into
speech
if
you
ever
stood
up
in
the
ring
an
an
a
man
as
good
as
yourself
for
twenty
rounds
you
get
what
i
drivin
at
jim
hazard
an
i
get
it
when
we
swim
out
through
the
surf
an
laugh
in
the
teeth
of
the
biggest
breakers
that
ever
pounded
the
beach
when
we
come
out
from
the
shower
rubbed
down
and
dressed
our
skin
muscles
like
silk
our
bodies
an
brains
all
like
he
paused
and
gave
up
from
sheer
inability
to
express
ideas
that
were
nebulous
at
best
and
that
in
reality
were
remembered
sensations
silk
of
the
body
can
you
beat
it
he
concluded
lamely
feeling
that
he
had
failed
to
make
his
point
embarrassed
by
the
circle
of
listeners
we
know
all
that
hall
retorted
the
lies
of
the
flesh
afterward
come
rheumatism
and
diabetes
the
wine
of
life
is
heady
but
all
too
quickly
it
turns
to
uric
acid
interpolated
the
wild
irish
playwright
they
plenty
more
of
the
good
things
billy
took
up
with
a
sudden
rush
of
words
good
things
all
the
way
up
from
juicy
porterhouse
and
the
kind
of
coffee
hall
makes
to
he
hesitated
at
what
he
was
about
to
say
then
took
it
at
a
plunge
to
a
woman
you
can
love
that
loves
you
just
take
a
look
at
saxon
there
with
the
ukulele
in
her
lap
there
where
i
got
the
jellyfish
in
the
dishwater
an
the
prize
hog
skinned
to
a
shout
of
applause
and
great
went
up
from
the
girls
and
billy
looked
painfully
uncomfortable
but
suppose
the
silk
goes
out
of
your
body
till
you
creak
like
a
rusty
wheelbarrow
hall
pursued
suppose
just
suppose
saxon
went
away
with
another
man
what
then
billy
considered
a
space
then
it
be
me
for
the
dishwater
an
the
jellyfish
i
he
straightened
up
in
his
chair
and
threw
back
his
shoulders
unconsciously
as
he
ran
a
hand
over
his
biceps
and
swelled
it
then
he
took
another
look
at
saxon
but
thank
the
lord
i
still
got
a
wallop
in
both
my
arms
an
a
wife
to
fill
with
again
the
girls
applauded
and
hall
cried
look
at
saxon
she
blushing
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
that
no
woman
could
be
happier
she
stammered
and
no
queen
as
proud
and
that
she
completed
the
thought
by
strumming
on
the
ukulele
and
singing
de
lawd
move
in
er
mischievous
way
his
blunders
to
i
give
you
best
hall
grinned
to
billy
oh
i
do
know
billy
disclaimed
modestly
you
read
so
much
i
guess
you
know
more
about
everything
than
i
oh
oh
traitor
taking
it
all
back
the
girls
cried
variously
billy
took
heart
of
courage
reassured
them
with
a
slow
smile
and
said
just
the
same
i
sooner
be
myself
than
have
book
indigestion
an
as
for
saxon
why
one
kiss
of
her
lips
is
worth
all
the
libraries
in
the
chapter
x
there
must
be
hills
and
valleys
and
rich
land
and
streams
of
clear
water
good
wagon
roads
and
a
railroad
not
too
far
away
plenty
of
sunshine
and
cold
enough
at
night
to
need
blankets
and
not
only
pines
but
plenty
of
other
kinds
of
trees
with
open
spaces
to
pasture
billy
horses
and
cattle
and
deer
and
rabbits
for
him
to
shoot
and
lots
and
lots
of
redwood
trees
and
and
well
and
no
fog
saxon
concluded
the
description
of
the
farm
she
and
billy
sought
mark
hall
laughed
delightedly
and
nightingales
roosting
in
all
the
trees
he
cried
flowers
that
neither
fail
nor
fade
bees
without
stings
honey
dew
every
morning
showers
of
manna
betweenwhiles
fountains
of
youth
and
quarries
of
philosopher
stones
why
i
know
the
very
place
let
me
show
she
waited
while
he
pored
over
of
the
state
failing
in
them
he
got
out
a
big
atlas
and
though
all
the
countries
of
the
world
were
in
it
he
could
not
find
what
he
was
after
never
mind
he
said
come
over
and
i
be
able
to
show
that
evening
he
led
her
out
on
the
veranda
to
the
telescope
and
she
found
herself
looking
through
it
at
the
full
moon
somewhere
up
there
in
some
valley
you
find
that
farm
he
teased
hall
looked
inquiringly
at
them
as
they
returned
inside
i
been
showing
her
a
valley
in
the
moon
where
she
expects
to
go
farming
he
laughed
we
started
out
prepared
to
go
any
distance
saxon
said
and
if
to
the
moon
i
expect
we
can
make
but
my
dear
child
you
ca
expect
to
find
such
a
paradise
on
the
earth
hall
continued
for
instance
you
ca
have
redwoods
without
fog
they
go
together
the
redwoods
grow
only
in
the
fog
saxon
debated
a
while
well
we
could
put
up
with
a
little
fog
she
conceded
almost
anything
to
have
redwoods
i
do
know
what
a
quarry
of
stones
is
like
but
if
it
anything
like
hafler
marble
quarry
and
there
a
railroad
handy
i
guess
we
could
manage
to
worry
along
and
you
do
have
to
go
to
the
moon
for
honey
dew
they
scrape
it
off
of
the
leaves
of
the
bushes
up
in
nevada
county
i
know
that
for
a
fact
because
my
father
told
my
mother
about
it
and
she
told
a
little
later
in
the
evening
the
subject
of
farming
having
remained
uppermost
hall
swept
off
into
a
diatribe
against
the
paradise
which
was
his
epithet
for
the
united
states
when
you
think
of
the
glorious
chance
he
said
a
new
country
bounded
by
the
oceans
situated
just
right
in
latitude
with
the
richest
land
and
vastest
natural
resources
of
any
country
in
the
world
settled
by
immigrants
who
had
thrown
off
all
the
leading
strings
of
the
old
world
and
were
in
the
humor
for
democracy
there
was
only
one
thing
to
stop
them
from
perfecting
the
democracy
they
started
and
that
thing
was
greediness
they
started
gobbling
everything
in
sight
like
a
lot
of
swine
and
while
they
gobbled
democracy
went
to
smash
gobbling
became
gambling
it
was
a
nation
of
tin
horns
whenever
a
man
lost
his
stake
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
chase
the
frontier
west
a
few
miles
and
get
another
stake
they
moved
over
the
face
of
the
land
like
so
many
locusts
they
destroyed
everything
the
indians
the
soil
the
forests
just
as
they
destroyed
the
buffalo
and
the
passenger
pigeon
their
morality
in
business
and
politics
was
gambler
morality
their
laws
were
gambling
laws
how
to
play
the
game
everybody
played
therefore
hurrah
for
the
game
nobody
objected
because
nobody
was
unable
to
play
as
i
said
the
losers
chased
the
frontier
for
fresh
stakes
the
winner
of
broke
on
the
day
following
might
be
riding
his
luck
to
royal
flushes
on
draws
so
they
gobbled
and
gambled
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
until
they
swined
a
whole
continent
when
they
finished
with
the
lands
and
forests
and
mines
they
turned
back
gambling
for
any
little
stakes
they
overlooked
gambling
for
franchises
and
monopolies
using
politics
to
protect
their
crooked
deals
and
brace
games
and
democracy
gone
clean
to
smash
and
then
was
the
funniest
time
of
all
the
losers
could
get
any
more
stakes
while
the
winners
went
on
gambling
among
themselves
the
losers
could
only
stand
around
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
look
on
when
they
got
hungry
they
went
hat
in
hand
and
begged
the
successful
gamblers
for
a
job
the
losers
went
to
work
for
the
winners
and
been
working
for
them
ever
since
and
democracy
up
salt
creek
you
billy
roberts
have
never
had
a
hand
in
the
game
in
your
life
that
because
your
people
were
among
the
how
about
yourself
billy
asked
i
ai
seen
you
holdin
any
i
do
have
to
i
do
count
i
am
a
what
that
a
flea
a
woodtick
anything
that
gets
something
for
nothing
i
batten
on
the
mangy
hides
of
the
workingmen
i
do
have
to
gamble
i
have
to
work
my
father
left
me
enough
of
his
oh
do
preen
yourself
my
boy
your
folks
were
just
as
bad
as
mine
but
yours
lost
and
mine
won
and
so
you
plow
in
my
potato
i
do
see
it
billy
contended
stoutly
a
man
with
gumption
can
win
out
on
government
land
hall
asked
quickly
billy
swallowed
and
acknowledged
the
stab
just
the
same
he
can
win
out
he
reiterated
surely
he
can
win
a
job
from
some
other
fellow
a
young
husky
with
a
good
head
like
yours
can
win
jobs
anywhere
but
think
of
the
handicaps
on
the
fellows
who
lose
how
many
tramps
have
you
met
along
the
road
who
could
get
a
job
driving
four
horses
for
the
carmel
livery
stable
and
some
of
them
were
as
husky
as
you
when
they
were
young
and
on
top
of
it
all
you
got
no
shout
coming
it
a
mighty
big
from
gambling
for
a
continent
to
gambling
for
a
just
the
same
billy
recommenced
oh
you
got
it
in
your
blood
hall
cut
him
off
cavalierly
and
why
not
everybody
in
this
country
has
been
gambling
for
generations
it
was
in
the
air
when
you
were
born
you
breathed
it
all
your
life
you
who
never
had
a
white
chip
in
the
game
still
go
on
shouting
for
it
and
capping
for
but
what
are
all
of
us
losers
to
do
saxon
inquired
call
in
the
police
and
stop
the
game
hall
recommended
saxon
frowned
do
what
your
forefathers
did
do
he
amplified
go
ahead
and
perfect
she
remembered
a
remark
of
mercedes
a
friend
of
mine
says
that
democracy
is
an
it
is
in
a
gambling
joint
there
are
a
million
boys
in
our
public
schools
right
now
swallowing
the
gump
of
canal
boy
to
president
and
millions
of
worthy
citizens
who
sleep
sound
every
night
in
the
belief
that
they
have
a
say
in
running
the
you
talk
like
my
brother
tom
saxon
said
failing
to
comprehend
if
we
all
get
into
politics
and
work
hard
for
something
better
maybe
get
it
after
a
thousand
years
or
so
but
i
want
it
she
clenched
her
hands
passionately
i
ca
wait
i
want
it
but
that
is
just
what
i
been
telling
you
my
dear
girl
what
the
trouble
with
all
the
losers
they
ca
wait
they
want
it
now
a
stack
of
chips
and
a
fling
at
the
game
well
they
wo
get
it
now
that
what
the
matter
with
you
chasing
a
valley
in
the
moon
that
what
the
matter
with
billy
aching
right
now
for
a
chance
to
win
ten
cents
from
me
at
pedro
cussing
under
his
gee
you
make
a
good
commented
billy
and
i
be
a
if
i
did
have
the
spending
of
my
gains
it
none
of
my
affair
let
them
rot
they
be
just
as
bad
if
they
were
on
top
it
all
a
mess
blind
bats
hungry
swine
and
filthy
buzzards
here
hall
interfered
now
mark
you
stop
that
or
you
be
getting
the
he
tossed
his
mop
of
hair
and
laughed
with
an
effort
no
i
wo
he
denied
i
going
to
get
ten
cents
from
billy
at
a
game
of
pedro
he
wo
have
a
look
saxon
and
billy
flourished
in
the
genial
human
atmosphere
of
carmel
they
appreciated
in
their
own
estimation
saxon
felt
that
she
was
something
more
than
a
laundry
girl
and
the
wife
of
a
union
teamster
she
was
no
longer
pent
in
the
narrow
working
class
environment
of
a
pine
street
neighborhood
life
had
grown
opulent
they
fared
better
physically
materially
and
spiritually
and
all
this
was
reflected
in
their
features
in
the
carriage
of
their
bodies
she
knew
billy
had
never
been
handsomer
nor
in
more
splendid
bodily
condition
he
swore
he
had
a
harem
and
that
she
was
his
second
wife
twice
as
beautiful
as
the
first
one
he
had
married
and
she
demurely
confessed
to
him
that
hall
and
several
others
of
the
matrons
had
enthusiastically
admired
her
form
one
day
when
in
for
a
cold
dip
in
carmel
river
they
had
got
around
her
and
called
her
venus
and
made
her
crouch
and
assume
different
poses
billy
understood
the
venus
reference
for
a
marble
one
with
broken
arms
stood
in
hall
living
room
and
the
poet
had
told
him
the
world
worshiped
it
as
the
perfection
of
female
form
i
always
said
you
had
annette
kellerman
beat
a
mile
billy
said
and
so
proud
was
his
air
of
possession
that
saxon
blushed
and
trembled
and
hid
her
hot
face
against
his
breast
the
men
in
the
crowd
were
open
in
their
admiration
of
saxon
in
an
manner
but
she
made
no
mistake
she
did
not
lose
her
head
there
was
no
chance
of
that
for
her
love
for
billy
beat
more
strongly
than
ever
nor
was
she
guilty
of
she
knew
him
for
what
he
was
and
loved
him
with
open
eyes
he
had
no
book
learning
no
art
like
the
other
men
his
grammar
was
bad
she
knew
that
just
as
she
knew
that
he
would
never
mend
it
yet
she
would
not
have
exchanged
him
for
any
of
the
others
not
even
for
mark
hall
with
the
princely
heart
whom
she
loved
much
in
the
same
way
that
she
loved
his
wife
for
that
matter
she
found
in
billy
a
certain
health
and
rightness
a
certain
essential
integrity
which
she
prized
more
highly
than
all
book
learning
and
bank
accounts
it
was
by
virtue
of
this
health
and
rightness
and
integrity
that
he
had
beaten
hall
in
argument
the
night
the
poet
was
on
the
pessimistic
rampage
billy
had
beaten
him
not
with
the
weapons
of
learning
but
just
by
being
himself
and
by
speaking
out
the
truth
that
was
in
him
best
of
all
he
had
not
even
known
that
he
had
beaten
and
had
taken
the
applause
as
banter
but
saxon
knew
though
she
could
scarcely
tell
why
and
she
would
always
remember
how
the
wife
of
shelley
had
whispered
to
her
afterward
with
shining
eyes
oh
saxon
you
must
be
so
were
saxon
driven
to
speech
to
attempt
to
express
what
billy
meant
to
her
she
would
have
done
it
with
the
simple
word
always
he
was
that
to
her
always
in
glowing
splendor
that
was
his
connotation
man
sometimes
by
herself
she
would
all
but
weep
with
joy
at
recollection
of
his
way
of
informing
some
truculent
male
that
he
was
standing
on
his
foot
get
off
your
foot
you
standin
on
it
was
billy
it
was
magnificently
billy
and
it
was
this
billy
who
loved
her
she
knew
it
she
knew
it
by
the
pulse
that
only
a
woman
knows
how
to
gauge
he
loved
her
less
wildly
it
was
true
but
more
fondly
more
maturely
it
was
the
love
that
lasted
if
only
they
did
not
go
back
to
the
city
where
the
beautiful
things
of
the
spirit
perished
and
the
beast
bared
its
fangs
in
the
early
spring
mark
hall
and
his
wife
went
to
new
york
the
two
japanese
servants
of
the
bungalow
were
dismissed
and
saxon
and
billy
were
installed
as
caretakers
jim
hazard
too
departed
on
his
yearly
visit
to
paris
and
though
billy
missed
him
he
continued
his
long
swims
out
through
the
breakers
hall
two
saddle
horses
had
been
left
in
his
charge
and
saxon
made
herself
a
pretty
riding
costume
of
corduroy
that
matched
the
glints
in
her
hair
billy
no
longer
worked
at
odd
jobs
as
extra
driver
at
the
stable
he
earned
more
than
they
spent
and
in
preference
to
cash
he
taught
saxon
to
ride
and
was
out
and
away
with
her
over
the
country
on
trips
a
favorite
ride
was
around
by
the
coast
to
monterey
where
he
taught
her
to
swim
in
the
big
del
monte
tank
they
would
come
home
in
the
evening
across
the
hills
also
she
took
to
following
him
on
his
early
morning
hunts
and
life
seemed
one
long
vacation
i
tell
you
one
thing
he
said
to
saxon
one
day
as
they
drew
their
horses
to
a
halt
and
gazed
down
into
carmel
valley
i
ai
never
going
to
work
steady
for
another
man
for
wages
as
long
as
i
work
is
everything
she
acknowledged
i
should
guess
not
why
look
here
saxon
what
it
mean
if
i
worked
teamin
in
oakland
for
a
million
dollars
a
day
for
a
million
years
and
just
had
to
go
on
stayin
there
an
livin
the
way
we
used
to
it
mean
work
all
day
three
squares
an
movin
pictures
for
recreation
pictures
huh
we
livin
movin
pictures
these
days
i
sooner
have
one
year
like
what
we
havin
here
in
carmel
and
then
die
than
a
thousan
million
years
like
on
pine
saxon
had
warned
the
halls
by
letter
that
she
and
billy
intended
starting
on
their
search
for
the
valley
in
the
moon
as
soon
as
the
first
of
summer
arrived
fortunately
the
poet
was
put
to
no
inconvenience
for
bideaux
the
iron
man
with
the
basilisk
eyes
had
abandoned
his
dreams
of
priesthood
and
decided
to
become
an
actor
he
arrived
at
carmel
from
the
catholic
college
in
time
to
take
charge
of
the
bungalow
much
to
saxon
gratification
the
crowd
was
loth
to
see
them
depart
the
owner
of
the
carmel
stable
offered
to
put
billy
in
charge
at
ninety
dollars
a
month
also
he
received
a
similar
offer
from
the
stable
in
pacific
grove
whither
away
the
wild
irish
playwright
hailed
them
on
the
station
platform
at
monterey
he
was
just
returning
from
new
york
to
a
valley
in
the
moon
saxon
answered
gaily
he
regarded
their
packs
by
george
he
cried
i
do
it
by
george
let
me
come
then
his
face
fell
and
i
signed
the
contract
he
groaned
three
acts
say
you
lucky
and
this
time
of
year
chapter
xi
we
hiked
into
monterey
last
winter
but
we
ridin
out
now
b
billy
said
as
the
train
pulled
out
and
they
leaned
back
in
their
seats
they
had
decided
against
retracing
their
steps
over
the
ground
already
traveled
and
took
the
train
to
san
francisco
they
had
been
warned
by
mark
hall
of
the
enervation
of
the
south
and
were
bound
north
for
their
blanket
climate
their
intention
was
to
cross
the
bay
to
sausalito
and
wander
up
through
the
coast
counties
here
hall
had
told
them
they
would
find
the
true
home
of
the
redwood
but
billy
in
the
smoking
car
for
a
cigarette
seated
himself
beside
a
man
who
was
destined
to
deflect
them
from
their
course
he
was
a
man
undoubtedly
a
jew
and
billy
remembering
saxon
admonition
always
to
ask
questions
watched
his
opportunity
and
started
a
conversation
it
took
but
a
little
while
to
learn
that
gunston
was
a
commission
merchant
and
to
realize
that
the
content
of
his
talk
was
too
valuable
for
saxon
to
lose
promptly
when
he
saw
that
the
other
cigar
was
finished
billy
invited
him
into
the
next
car
to
meet
saxon
billy
would
have
been
incapable
of
such
an
act
prior
to
his
sojourn
in
carmel
that
much
at

i
was
just
telling
your
husband
about
the
way
the
chinese
make
things
go
up
the
san
joaquin
river

would
be
worth
your
while
to
go
up
there
and
look
around
it
the
good
season
now
too
early
for
mosquitoes
you
can
get
off
the
train
at
black
diamond
or
antioch
and
travel
around
among
the
big
farming
islands
on
the
steamers
and
launches
the
fares
are
cheap
and
you
find
some
of
those
big
gasoline
boats
like
the
duchess
and
princess
more
like
big
tell
her
about
chow
lam
billy
urged
the
commission
merchant
leaned
back
and
laughed
chow
lam
several
years
ago
was
a
fan
tan
player
he
had
a
cent
and
his
health
was
going
back
on
him
he
had
worn
out
his
back
with
twenty
years
work
in
the
gold
mines
washing
over
the
tailings
of
the
early
miners
and
whatever
he
made
he
lost
at
gambling
also
he
was
in
debt
three
hundred
dollars
to
the
six
companies
you
know
they
chinese
affairs
and
remember
this
was
only
seven
years
ago
health
breaking
down
three
hundred
in
debt
and
no
trade
chow
lam
blew
into
stockton
and
got
a
job
on
the
peat
lands
at
day
wages
it
was
a
chinese
company
down
on
middle
river
that
farmed
celery
and
asparagus
this
was
when
he
got
onto
himself
and
took
stock
of
himself
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
the
united
states
back
not
so
strong
as
it
used
to
was
and
not
a
penny
laid
by
for
his
return
to
china
he
saw
how
the
chinese
in
the
company
had
done
it
saved
their
wages
and
bought
a
share
he
saved
his
wages
for
two
years
and
bought
one
share
in
a
company
that
was
only
five
years
ago
they
leased
three
hundred
acres
of
peat
land
from
a
white
man
who
preferred
traveling
in
europe
out
of
the
profits
of
that
one
share
in
the
first
year
he
bought
two
shares
in
another
company
and
in
a
year
more
out
of
the
three
shares
he
organized
a
company
of
his
own
one
year
of
this
with
bad
luck
and
he
just
broke
even
that
brings
it
up
to
three
years
ago
the
following
year
bumper
crops
he
netted
four
thousand
the
next
year
it
was
five
thousand
and
last
year
he
cleaned
up
nineteen
thousand
dollars
pretty
good
eh
for
old
chow
lam
my
was
all
saxon
could
say
her
eager
interest
however
incited
the
commission
merchant
to
go
on
look
at
sing
kee
the
potato
king
of
stockton
i
know
him
well
had
more
large
deals
with
him
and
made
less
money
than
with
any
man
i
know
he
was
only
a
coolie
and
he
smuggled
himself
into
the
united
states
twenty
years
ago
started
at
day
wages
then
peddled
vegetables
in
a
couple
of
baskets
slung
on
a
stick
and
after
that
opened
up
a
store
in
chinatown
in
san
francisco
but
he
had
a
head
on
him
and
he
was
soon
onto
the
curves
of
the
chinese
farmers
that
dealt
at
his
store
the
store
could
make
money
fast
enough
to
suit
him
he
headed
up
the
san
joaquin
did
do
much
for
a
couple
of
years
except
keep
his
eyes
peeled
then
he
jumped
in
and
leased
twelve
hundred
acres
at
seven
dollars
an
my
god
billy
said
in
an
voice
eight
thousan
four
hundred
dollars
just
for
rent
the
first
year
i
know
five
hundred
acres
i
can
buy
for
three
dollars
an
will
it
grow
potatoes
gunston
asked
billy
shook
his
head
nor
nothin
else
i
all
three
laughed
heartily
and
the
commission
merchant
resumed
that
seven
dollars
was
only
for
the
land
possibly
you
know
what
it
costs
to
plow
twelve
hundred
acres
billy
nodded
solemnly
and
he
got
a
hundred
and
sixty
sacks
to
the
acre
that
year
gunston
continued
potatoes
were
selling
at
fifty
cents
my
father
was
at
the
head
of
our
concern
at
the
time
so
i
know
for
a
fact
and
sing
kee
could
have
sold
at
fifty
cents
and
made
money
but
did
he
trust
a
chinaman
to
know
the
market
they
can
skin
the
commission
merchants
at
it
sing
kee
held
on
when
everybody
else
had
sold
potatoes
began
to
climb
he
laughed
at
our
buyers
when
we
offered
him
sixty
cents
seventy
cents
a
dollar
do
you
want
to
know
what
he
finally
did
sell
for
one
dollar
and
a
sack
suppose
they
actually
cost
him
forty
cents
a
hundred
and
sixty
times
twelve
hundred
let
me
see
twelve
times
nought
is
nought
and
twelve
times
sixteen
is
a
hundred
and
a
hundred
and
thousand
sacks
at
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
net
four
into
a
hundred
and
is
plus
is
two
hundred
and
forty
there
you
are
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
dollars
clear
profit
on
that
year
an
him
a
chink
billy
mourned
disconsolately
he
turned
to
saxon
they
ought
to
be
some
new
country
for
us
white
folks
to
go
to
gosh
we
settin
on
the
stoop
all
right
all
but
of
course
that
was
unusual
gunston
hastened
to
qualify
there
was
a
failure
of
potatoes
in
other
districts
and
a
corner
and
in
some
strange
way
sing
kee
was
dead
on
he
never
made
profits
like
that
again
but
he
goes
ahead
steadily
last
year
he
had
four
thousand
acres
in
potatoes
a
thousand
in
asparagus
five
hundred
in
celery
and
five
hundred
in
beans
and
he
running
six
hundred
acres
in
seeds
no
matter
what
happens
to
one
or
two
crops
he
ca
lose
on
all
of
i
seen
twelve
thousand
acres
of
apple
trees
saxon
said
and
like
to
see
four
thousand
acres
in
and
we
will
billy
rejoined
with
great
positiveness
it
us
for
the
san
joaquin
we
do
know
what
in
our
country
no
wonder
we
out
on
the
you
find
lots
of
kings
up
there
gunston
related
yep
hong
lee
they
call
him
jim
and
ah
pock
and
ah
whang
and
then
there
shima
the
japanese
potato
king
he
worth
several
millions
lives
like
a
why
do
americans
succeed
like
that
asked
saxon
because
they
wo
i
guess
there
nothing
to
stop
them
except
themselves
i
tell
you
one
thing
though
give
me
the
chinese
to
deal
with
he
honest
his
word
is
as
good
as
his
bond
if
he
says
do
a
thing
he
do
it
and
anyway
the
white
man
does
know
how
to
farm
even
the
white
farmer
is
content
with
one
crop
at
a
time
and
rotation
of
crops
john
chinaman
goes
him
one
better
and
grows
two
crops
at
one
time
on
the
same
soil
i
seen
it
radishes
and
carrots
two
crops
sown
at
one
which
do
stand
to
reason
billy
objected
they
be
only
a
half
crop
of
another
guess
coming
gunston
jeered
carrots
have
to
be
thinned
when
they
so
far
along
so
do
radishes
but
carrots
grow
slow
radishes
grow
fast
the
carrots
serve
the
purpose
of
thinning
the
radishes
and
when
the
radishes
are
pulled
ready
for
market
that
thins
the
carrots
which
come
along
later
you
ca
beat
the
do
see
why
a
white
man
ca
do
what
a
chink
can
protested
billy
that
sounds
all
right
gunston
replied
the
only
objection
is
that
the
white
man
does
the
chink
is
busy
all
the
time
and
he
keeps
the
ground
just
as
busy
he
has
organization
system
who
ever
heard
of
white
farmers
keeping
books
the
chink
does
no
guess
work
with
him
he
knows
just
where
he
stands
to
a
cent
on
any
crop
at
any
moment
and
he
knows
the
market
he
plays
both
ends
how
he
does
it
is
beyond
me
but
he
knows
the
market
better
than
we
commission
merchants
then
again
he
patient
but
not
stubborn
suppose
he
does
make
a
mistake
and
gets
in
a
crop
and
then
finds
the
market
is
wrong
in
such
a
situation
the
white
man
gets
stubborn
and
hangs
on
like
a
bulldog
but
not
the
chink
he
going
to
minimize
the
losses
of
that
mistake
that
land
has
got
to
work
and
make
money
without
a
quiver
or
a
regret
the
moment
he
learned
his
error
he
puts
his
plows
into
that
crop
turns
it
under
and
plants
something
else
he
has
the
savve
he
can
look
at
a
sprout
just
poked
up
out
of
the
ground
and
tell
how
it
going
to
turn
out
whether
it
will
head
up
or
wo
head
up
or
if
it
going
to
head
up
good
medium
or
bad
that
one
end
take
the
other
end
he
controls
his
crop
he
forces
it
or
holds
it
back
with
an
eye
on
the
market
and
when
the
market
is
just
right
there
his
crop
ready
to
deliver
timed
to
the
the
conversation
with
gunston
lasted
hours
and
the
more
he
talked
of
the
chinese
and
their
farming
ways
the
more
saxon
became
aware
of
a
growing
dissatisfaction
she
did
not
question
the
facts
the
trouble
was
that
they
were
not
alluring
somehow
she
could
not
find
place
for
them
in
her
valley
of
the
moon
it
was
not
until
the
genial
jew
left
the
train
that
billy
gave
definite
statement
to
what
was
vaguely
bothering
her
huh
we
ai
chinks
we
white
folks
does
a
chink
ever
want
to
ride
a
horse
for
election
an
havin
a
good
time
of
it
did
you
ever
see
a
chink
go
swimmin
out
through
the
breakers
at
carmel
or
boxin
wrestlin
runnin
an
jumpin
for
the
sport
of
it
did
you
ever
see
a
chink
take
a
shotgun
on
his
arm
tramp
six
miles
an
come
back
happy
with
one
measly
rabbit
what
does
a
chink
do
work

damned
head

oh
billy
saxon
cried
it
just
what
i
been
trying
to
get
straightened
out
in
my
head
it
been
worrying
me
for
ever
so
long
i
was
afraid
there
was
something
wrong
with
me
that
i
was
made
for
the
country
after
all
all
the
time
i
did
envy
the
san
leandro
portuguese
i
did
want
to
be
one
nor
a
pajaro
valley
dalmatian
nor
even
a
mortimer
and
you
did
either
what
we
want
is
a
valley
of
the
moon
with
not
too
much
work
and
all
the
fun
we
want
and
just
keep
on
looking
until
we
find
it
and
if
we
do
find
it
go
on
having
the
fun
just
as
we
have
ever
since
we
left
oakland
and
billy
we
never
never
going
to
work
our
damned
heads
off
are
we
not
on
your
life
billy
growled
in
fierce
affirmation
they
walked
into
black
diamond
with
their
packs
on
their
backs
it
was
a
scattered
village
of
shabby
little
cottages
with
a
main
street
that
was
a
wallow
of
black
mud
from
the
last
late
spring
rain
the
sidewalks
bumped
up
and
down
in
uneven
steps
and
landings
everything
seemed
the
names
on
the
strange
dingy
shops
were
unspeakably
foreign
the
one
dingy
hotel
was
run
by
a
greek
greeks
were
everywhere
swarthy
men
in
and
hatless
women
in
bright
colors
hordes
of
sturdy
children
and
all
speaking
in
outlandish
voices
crying
shrilly
and
vivaciously
with
the
volubility
of
the
mediterranean
huh
this
ai
the
united
states
billy
muttered
down
on
the
water
front
they
found
a
fish
cannery
and
an
asparagus
cannery
in
the
height
of
the
busy
season
where
they
looked
in
vain
among
the
toilers
for
familiar
american
faces
billy
picked
out
the
bookkeepers
and
foremen
for
americans
all
the
rest
were
greeks
italians
and
chinese
at
the
steamboat
wharf
they
watched
the
greek
boats
arriving
discharging
their
loads
of
glorious
salmon
and
departing
new
york
as
the
slough
was
called
curved
to
the
west
and
north
and
flowed
into
a
vast
body
of
water
which
was
the
united
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
rivers
beyond
the
steamboat
wharf
the
fishing
wharves
dwindled
to
stages
for
the
drying
of
nets
and
here
away
from
the
noise
and
clatter
of
the
alien
town
saxon
and
billy
took
off
their
packs
and
rested
the
tall
rustling
tules
grew
out
of
the
deep
water
close
to
the
dilapidated
where
they
sat
opposite
the
town
lay
a
long
flat
island
on
which
a
row
of
ragged
poplars
leaned
against
the
sky
just
like
in
that
dutch
windmill
picture
mark
hall
has
saxon
said
billy
pointed
out
the
mouth
of
the
slough
and
across
the
broad
reach
of
water
to
a
cluster
of
tiny
white
buildings
behind
which
like
a
glimmering
mirage
rolled
the
low
montezuma
hills
those
houses
is
collinsville
he
informed
her
the
sacramento
river
comes
in
there
and
you
go
up
it
to
rio
vista
an
isleton
and
walnut
grove
and
all
those
places
gunston
was
tellin
us
about
all
islands
and
sloughs
connectin
clear
across
an
back
to
the
san
is
the
sun
good
saxon
yawned
and
how
quiet
it
is
here
so
short
a
distance
away
from
those
strange
foreigners
and
to
think
in
the
cities
right
now
men
are
beating
and
killing
each
other
for
now
and
again
an
overland
passenger
train
rushed
by
in
the
distance
echoing
along
the
background
of
foothills
of
mt
diablo
which
bulked
greencrinkled
against
the
sky
then
the
slumbrous
quiet
would
fall
to
be
broken
by
the
far
call
of
a
foreign
tongue
or
by
a
gasoline
fishing
boat
chugging
in
through
the
mouth
of
the
slough
not
a
hundred
feet
away
anchored
close
in
the
tules
lay
a
beautiful
white
yacht
despite
its
tininess
it
looked
broad
and
comfortable
smoke
was
rising
from
its
stovepipe
on
its
stern
in
gold
letters
they
read
roamer
on
top
of
the
cabin
basking
in
the
sunshine
lay
a
man
and
woman
the
latter
with
a
pink
scarf
around
her
head
the
man
was
reading
aloud
from
a
book
while
she
sewed
beside
them
sprawled
a
fox
terrier
gosh
they
do
have
to
stick
around
cities
to
be
happy
billy
commented
a
japanese
came
on
deck
from
the
cabin
sat
down
and
began
picking
a
chicken
the
feathers
floated
away
in
a
long
line
toward
the
mouth
of
the
slough
oh
look
saxon
pointed
in
her
excitement
he
fishing
and
the
line
is
fast
to
his
toe
the
man
had
dropped
the
book
on
the
cabin
and
reached
for
the
line
while
the
woman
looked
up
from
her
sewing
and
the
terrier
began
to
bark
in
came
the
line
hand
under
hand
and
at
the
end
a
big
catfish
when
this
was
removed
and
the
line
rebaited
and
dropped
overboard
the
man
took
a
turn
around
his
toe
and
went
on
reading
a
japanese
came
down
on
the
beside
saxon
and
billy
and
hailed
the
yacht
he
carried
parcels
of
meat
and
vegetables
one
coat
pocket
bulged
with
letters
the
other
with
morning
papers
in
response
to
his
hail
the
japanese
on
the
yacht
stood
up
with
the
chicken
the
man
said
something
to
him
put
aside
the
book
got
into
the
white
skiff
lying
astern
and
rowed
to
the
landing
as
he
came
alongside
the
stage
he
pulled
in
his
oars
caught
hold
and
said
good
morning
genially
why
i
know
you
saxon
said
impulsively
to
billy
amazement
you
here
she
broke
off
in
confusion
go
on
the
man
said
smiling
reassurance
you
are
jack
hastings
i
sure
of
it
i
used
to
see
your
photograph
in
the
papers
all
the
time
you
were
war
correspondent
in
the
war
you
written
lots
of
books
though
i
never
read
right
you
are
he
ratified
and
what
your
name
saxon
introduced
herself
and
billy
and
when
she
noted
the
observant
eye
on
their
packs
she
sketched
the
pilgrimage
they
were
on
the
farm
in
the
valley
of
the
moon
evidently
caught
his
fancy
and
though
the
japanese
and
his
parcels
were
safely
in
the
skiff
hastings
still
lingered
when
saxon
spoke
of
carmel
he
seemed
to
know
everybody
in
hall
crowd
and
when
he
heard
they
were
intending
to
go
to
rio
vista
his
invitation
was
immediate
why
we
going
that
way
ourselves
inside
an
hour
as
soon
as
slack
water
comes
he
exclaimed
it
just
the
thing
come
on
on
board
we
be
there
by
four
this
afternoon
if
there
any
wind
at
all
come
on
my
wife
on
board
and
hall
is
one
of
her
best
chums
been
away
to
south
america
just
got
back
or
you
have
seen
us
in
carmel
hal
wrote
to
us
about
the
pair
of
it
was
the
second
time
in
her
life
that
saxon
had
been
in
a
small
boat
and
the
roamer
was
the
first
yacht
she
had
ever
been
on
board
the
writer
wife
whom
he
called
clara
welcomed
them
heartily
and
saxon
lost
no
time
in
falling
in
love
with
her
and
in
being
fallen
in
love
with
in
return
so
strikingly
did
they
resemble
each
other
that
hastings
was
not
many
minutes
in
calling
attention
to
it
he
made
them
stand
side
by
side
studied
their
eyes
and
mouths
and
ears
compared
their
hands
their
hair
their
ankles
and
swore
that
his
fondest
dream
was
shattered
namely
that
when
clara
had
been
made
the
mold
was
broken
on
clara
suggestion
that
it
might
have
been
pretty
much
the
same
mold
they
compared
histories
both
were
of
the
pioneer
stock
clara
mother
like
saxon
had
crossed
the
plains
with
and
like
saxon
had
wintered
in
salt
intake
city
in
fact
had
with
her
sisters
opened
the
first
gentile
school
in
that
mormon
stronghold
and
if
father
had
helped
raise
the
bear
flag
rebellion
at
sonoma
it
was
at
sonoma
that
clara
father
had
mustered
in
for
the
war
of
the
rebellion
and
ridden
as
far
east
with
his
troop
as
salt
lake
city
of
which
place
he
had
been
provost
marshal
when
the
mormon
trouble
flared
up
to
complete
it
all
clara
fetched
from
the
cabin
an
ukulele
of
boa
wood
that
was
the
twin
to
saxon
and
together
they
sang
honolulu
hastings
decided
to
eat
dinner
he
called
the
midday
meal
by
its
name
before
sailing
and
down
below
saxon
was
surprised
and
delighted
by
the
measure
of
comfort
in
so
tiny
a
cabin
there
was
just
room
for
billy
to
stand
upright
a
divided
the
room
in
half
longitudinally
and
to
this
was
attached
the
hinged
table
from
which
they
ate
low
bunks
that
ran
the
full
cabin
length
upholstered
in
cheerful
green
served
as
seats
a
curtain
easily
attached
by
hooks
between
the
and
the
roof
at
night
screened
hastings
sleeping
quarters
on
the
opposite
side
the
two
japanese
bunked
while
under
the
deck
was
the
galley
so
small
was
it
that
there
was
just
room
beside
it
for
the
cook
who
was
compelled
by
the
low
deck
to
squat
on
his
hands
the
other
japanese
who
had
brought
the
parcels
on
board
waited
on
the
table
they
are
looking
for
a
ranch
in
the
valley
of
the
moon
hastings
concluded
his
explanation
of
the
pilgrimage
to
clara
oh
do
you
know
she
cried
but
was
silenced
by
her
husband
hush
he
said
peremptorily
then
turned
to
their
guests
listen
there
something
in
that
valley
of
the
moon
idea
but
i
wo
tell
you
what
it
is
a
secret
now
we
a
ranch
in
sonoma
valley
about
eight
miles
from
the
very
town
of
sonoma
where
you
two
girls
fathers
took
up
soldiering
and
if
you
ever
come
to
our
ranch
you
learn
the
secret
oh
believe
me
it
connected
with
your
valley
of
the
is
it
mate
this
last
was
the
mutual
name
he
and
clara
had
for
each
other
she
smiled
and
laughed
and
nodded
her
head
you
might
find
our
valley
the
very
one
you
are
looking
for
she
said
but
hastings
shook
his
head
at
her
to
check
further
speech
she
turned
to
the
fox
terrier
and
made
it
speak
for
a
piece
of
meat
her
name
peggy
she
told
saxon
we
had
two
irish
terriers
down
in
the
south
seas
brother
and
sister
but
they
died
we
called
them
peggy
and
possum
so
she
named
after
the
original
billy
was
impressed
by
the
ease
with
which
the
roamer
was
operated
while
they
lingered
at
table
at
a
word
from
hastings
the
two
japanese
had
gone
on
deck
billy
could
hear
them
throwing
down
the
halyards
casting
off
gaskets
and
heaving
the
anchor
short
on
the
tiny
winch
in
several
minutes
one
called
down
that
everything
was
ready
and
all
went
on
deck
hoisting
mainsail
and
jigger
was
a
matter
of
minutes
then
the
cook
and
broke
out
anchor
and
while
one
hove
it
up
the
other
hoisted
the
jib
hastings
at
the
wheel
trimmed
the
sheet
the
roamer
paid
off
filled
her
sails
slightly
heeling
and
slid
across
the
smooth
water
and
out
the
mouth
of
new
york
slough
the
japanese
coiled
the
halyards
and
went
below
for
their
own
dinner
the
flood
is
just
beginning
to
make
said
hastings
pointing
to
a
striped
that
was
slightly
tipping
on
the
edge
of
the
channel
the
tiny
white
houses
of
collinsville
which
they
were
nearing
disappeared
behind
a
low
island
though
the
montezuma
hills
with
their
long
low
restful
lines
slumbered
on
the
horizon
apparently
as
far
away
as
ever
as
the
roamer
passed
the
mouth
of
montezuma
slough
and
entered
the
sacramento
they
came
upon
collinsville
close
at
hand
saxon
clapped
her
hands
it
like
a
lot
of
toy
houses
she
said
cut
out
of
cardboard
and
those
hilly
fields
are
just
painted
up
they
passed
many
arks
and
houseboats
of
fishermen
moored
among
the
tules
and
the
women
and
children
like
the
men
in
the
boats
were
foreign
as
they
proceeded
up
the
river
they
began
to
encounter
dredges
at
work
biting
out
mouthfuls
of
the
sandy
river
bottom
and
heaping
it
on
top
of
the
huge
levees
great
mats
of
willow
brush
hundreds
of
yards
in
length
were
laid
on
top
of
the
of
the
levees
and
held
in
place
by
steel
cables
and
thousands
of
cubes
of
cement
the
willows
soon
sprouted
hastings
told
them
and
by
the
time
the
mats
were
rotted
away
the
sand
was
held
in
place
by
the
roots
of
the
trees
it
must
cost
like
sam
hill
billy
observed
but
the
land
is
worth
it
hastings
explained
this
island
land
is
the
most
productive
in
the
world
this
section
of
california
is
like
holland
you
would
think
it
but
this
water
we
sailing
on
is
higher
than
the
surface
of
the
islands
they
like
leaky
boats
calking
patching
pumping
night
and
day
and
all
the
time
but
it
pays
it
except
for
the
dredgers
the
sand
the
dense
willow
thickets
and
always
mt
diablo
to
the
south
nothing
was
to
be
seen
occasionally
a
river
steamboat
passed
and
blue
herons
flew
into
the
trees
it
must
be
very
lonely
saxon
remarked
hastings
laughed
and
told
her
she
would
change
her
mind
later
much
he
related
to
them
of
the
river
lands
and
after
a
while
he
got
on
the
subject
of
tenant
farming
saxon
had
started
him
by
speaking
of
the
he
snapped
that
our
record
in
this
country
as
one
old
reuben
told
a
professor
of
an
agricultural
experiment
station
ai
no
sense
in
tryin
to
teach
me
farmin
i
know
all
about
it
i
worked
out
three
farms
it
was
his
kind
that
destroyed
new
england
back
there
great
sections
are
relapsing
to
wilderness
in
one
state
at
least
the
deer
have
increased
until
they
are
a
nuisance
there
are
abandoned
farms
by
the
tens
of
thousands
i
gone
over
the
lists
of
them
farms
in
new
york
new
jersey
massachusetts
connecticut
offered
for
sale
on
easy
payment
the
prices
asked
would
pay
for
the
improvements
while
the
land
of
course
is
thrown
in
for
nothing
and
the
same
thing
is
going
on
in
one
way
or
another
the
same
and
hogging
over
the
rest
of
the
country
down
in
texas
in
missouri
and
kansas
out
here
in
california
take
tenant
farming
i
know
a
ranch
in
my
county
where
the
land
was
worth
a
hundred
and
an
acre
and
it
gave
its
return
at
that
valuation
when
the
old
man
died
the
son
leased
it
to
a
portuguese
and
went
to
live
in
the
city
in
five
years
the
portuguese
skimmed
the
cream
and
dried
up
the
udder
the
second
lease
with
another
portuguese
for
three
years
gave
the
former
return
no
third
portuguese
appeared
to
offer
to
lease
it
there
was
anything
left
that
ranch
was
worth
fifty
thousand
when
the
old
man
died
in
the
end
the
son
got
eleven
thousand
for
it
why
i
seen
land
that
paid
twelve
per
that
after
the
skimming
of
a
lease
paid
only
one
and
a
quarter
per
it
the
same
in
our
valley
hastings
supplemented
all
the
old
farms
are
dropping
into
ruin
take
the
ebell
place
her
husband
nodded
emphatic
indorsement
when
we
used
to
know
it
it
was
a
perfect
paradise
of
a
farm
there
were
dams
and
lakes
beautiful
meadows
lush
hayfields
red
hills
of
hundreds
of
acres
of
good
pasture
heavenly
groves
of
pines
and
oaks
a
stone
winery
stone
barns
grounds
oh
i
could
describe
it
in
hours
when
bell
died
the
family
scattered
and
the
leasing
began
it
a
ruin
the
trees
have
been
cut
and
sold
for
firewood
there
only
a
little
bit
of
the
vineyard
that
is
abandoned
just
enough
to
make
wine
for
the
present
italian
lessees
who
are
running
a
milk
ranch
on
the
leavings
of
the
soil
i
rode
over
it
last
year
and
cried
the
beautiful
orchard
is
a
horror
the
grounds
have
gone
back
to
the
wild
just
because
they
did
keep
the
gutters
cleaned
out
the
rain
trickled
down
and
the
timbers
and
the
big
stone
barn
is
caved
in
the
same
with
part
of
the
winery
the
other
part
is
used
for
stabling
the
cows
and
the
house
words
ca
describe
it
become
a
profession
hastings
went
on
the
they
lease
clean
out
and
gut
a
place
in
several
years
and
then
move
on
not
like
the
foreigners
the
chinese
and
japanese
and
the
rest
in
the
main
they
a
lazy
vagabond
sort
who
do
nothing
else
but
skin
the
soil
and
move
skin
the
soil
and
move
now
take
the
portuguese
and
italians
in
our
country
they
are
different
they
arrive
in
the
country
without
a
penny
and
work
for
others
of
their
countrymen
until
they
learned
the
language
and
their
way
about
now
they
not
movers
what
they
are
after
is
land
of
their
own
which
they
will
love
and
care
for
and
conserve
but
in
the
meantime
how
to
get
it
saving
wages
is
slow
there
is
a
quicker
way
they
lease
in
three
years
they
can
gut
enough
out
of
somebody
else
land
to
set
themselves
up
for
life
it
is
sacrilege
a
veritable
rape
of
the
land
but
what
of
it
it
the
way
of
the
united
he
turned
suddenly
on
billy
look
here
roberts
you
and
your
wife
are
looking
for
your
bit
of
land
you
want
it
bad
now
take
my
advice
it
cold
hard
advice
become
a
tenant
farmer
lease
some
place
where
the
old
folks
have
died
and
the
country
is
good
enough
for
the
sons
and
daughters
then
gut
it
wring
the
last
dollar
out
of
the
soil
repair
nothing
and
in
three
years
you
have
your
own
place
paid
for
then
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
love
your
soil
nourish
it
every
dollar
you
feed
it
will
return
you
two
and
have
nothing
scrub
about
the
place
if
it
a
horse
a
cow
a
pig
a
chicken
or
a
blackberry
vine
see
that
it
but
it
wicked
saxon
wrung
out
it
wicked
we
live
in
a
wicked
age
hastings
countered
smiling
grimly
this
wholesale
is
the
national
crime
of
the
united
states
nor
would
i
give
your
husband
such
advice
if
i
absolutely
certain
that
the
land
he
skins
would
be
skinned
by
some
portuguese
or
italian
if
he
refused
as
fast
as
they
arrive
and
settle
down
they
send
for
their
sisters
and
their
cousins
and
their
aunts
if
you
were
thirsty
if
a
warehouse
were
burning
and
beautiful
rhine
wine
were
running
to
waste
would
you
stay
your
hand
from
scooping
a
drink
well
the
national
warehouse
is
afire
in
many
places
and
no
end
of
the
good
things
are
running
to
waste
help
yourself
if
you
do
the
immigrants
oh
you
do
know
him
hastings
hurried
to
explain
he
spends
all
his
time
on
the
ranch
in
conserving
the
soil
there
are
over
a
thousand
acres
of
woods
alone
and
though
he
thins
and
forests
like
a
surgeon
he
wo
let
a
tree
be
chopped
without
his
permission
even
planted
a
hundred
thousand
trees
he
always
draining
and
ditching
to
stop
erosion
and
experimenting
with
pasture
grasses
and
every
little
while
he
buys
some
exhausted
adjoining
ranch
and
starts
building
up
the
wherefore
i
know
what
i
talking
about
hastings
broke
in
and
my
advice
holds
i
love
the
soil
yet
things
being
as
they
are
and
if
i
were
poor
i
gut
five
hundred
acres
in
order
to
buy
for
myself
when
you
get
into
sonoma
valley
look
me
up
and
i
put
you
onto
the
whole
game
and
both
ends
of
it
i
show
you
construction
as
well
as
destruction
when
you
find
a
farm
doomed
to
be
gutted
anyway
why
jump
in
and
do
it
yes
and
he
mortgaged
himself
to
the
eyes
laughed
hastings
to
keep
five
hundred
acres
of
woods
out
of
the
hands
of
the
charcoal
ahead
on
the
left
bank
of
the
sacramento
just
at
the
fading
end
of
the
montezuma
hills
rio
vista
appeared
the
roamer
slipped
through
the
smooth
water
past
steamboat
wharves
landing
stages
and
warehouses
the
two
japanese
went
on
deck
at
command
of
hastings
the
jib
ran
down
and
he
shot
the
roomer
into
the
wind
losing
way
until
he
called
let
go
the
hook
the
anchor
went
down
and
the
yacht
swung
to
it
so
close
to
shore
that
the
skiff
lay
under
overhanging
willows
farther
up
the
river
we
tie
to
the
bank
hastings
said
so
that
when
you
wake
in
the
morning
you
find
the
branches
of
trees
sticking
down
into
the
ooh
saxon
murmured
pointing
to
a
lump
on
her
wrist
look
at
that
a
pretty
early
for
them
hastings
said
but
later
on
they
terrible
i
seen
them
so
thick
i
could
back
the
jib
against
saxon
was
not
nautical
enough
to
appreciate
his
hyperbole
though
billy
grinned
there
are
no
mosquitoes
in
the
valley
of
the
moon
she
said
no
never
said
hastings
whose
husband
began
immediately
to
regret
the
smallness
of
the
cabin
which
prevented
him
from
offering
sleeping
accommodations
an
automobile
bumped
along
on
top
of
the
levee
and
the
young
boys
and
girls
in
it
cried
oh
you
kid
to
saxon
and
billy
and
hastings
who
was
rowing
them
ashore
in
the
skiff
hastings
called
oh
you
kid
back
to
them
and
saxon
pleasuring
in
the
boyishness
of
his
sunburned
face
was
reminded
of
the
boyishness
of
mark
hall
and
his
carmel
crowd
chapter
xii
crossing
the
sacramento
on
an
ferry
a
short
distance
above
rio
vista
saxon
and
billy
entered
the
river
country
from
the
top
of
the
levee
she
got
her
revelation
beneath
lower
than
the
river
stretched
broad
flat
land
far
as
the
eye
could
see
roads
ran
in
every
direction
and
she
saw
countless
farmhouses
of
which
she
had
never
dreamed
when
sailing
on
the
lonely
river
a
few
feet
the
other
side
of
the
willowy
fringe
three
weeks
they
spent
among
the
rich
farm
islands
which
heaped
up
levees
and
pumped
day
and
night
to
keep
afloat
it
was
a
monotonous
land
with
an
unvarying
richness
of
soil
and
with
only
one
landmark
mt
diablo
ever
to
be
seen
sleeping
in
the
midday
azure
limping
its
crinkled
mass
against
the
sunset
sky
or
forming
like
a
dream
out
of
the
silver
dawn
sometimes
on
foot
often
by
launch
they
and
threaded
the
river
region
as
far
as
the
peat
lands
of
the
middle
river
down
the
san
joaquin
to
antioch
and
up
georgiana
slough
to
walnut
grove
on
the
sacramento
and
it
proved
a
foreign
land
the
workers
of
the
soil
teemed
by
thousands
yet
saxon
and
billy
knew
what
it
was
to
go
a
whole
day
without
finding
any
one
who
spoke
english
they
encountered
sometimes
in
whole
villages
chinese
japanese
italians
portuguese
swiss
hindus
koreans
norwegians
danes
french
armenians
slavs
almost
every
nationality
save
american
one
american
they
found
on
the
lower
reaches
of
georgiana
who
eked
an
illicit
existence
by
fishing
with
traps
another
american
who
spouted
blood
and
destruction
on
all
political
subjects
was
an
itinerant
at
walnut
grove
bustling
with
life
the
few
americans
consisted
of
the
storekeeper
the
saloonkeeper
the
butcher
the
keeper
of
the
drawbridge
and
the
ferryman
yet
two
thriving
towns
were
in
walnut
grove
one
chinese
one
japanese
most
of
the
land
was
owned
by
americans
who
lived
away
from
it
and
were
continually
selling
it
to
the
foreigners
a
riot
or
a
they
could
not
tell
which
was
taking
place
in
the
japanese
town
as
saxon
and
billy
steamed
out
on
the
apache
bound
for
sacramento
we
settin
on
the
stoop
billy
railed
pretty
soon
they
crowd
us
off
of
there
wo
be
any
stoop
in
the
valley
of
the
moon
saxon
cheered
him
but
he
was
inconsolable
remarking
bitterly
an
they
ai
one
of
them
damn
foreigners
that
can
handle
four
horses
like
me
but
they
can
everlastingly
farm
he
added
and
saxon
looking
at
his
moody
face
was
suddenly
reminded
of
a
lithograph
she
had
seen
in
her
childhood
it
was
of
a
plains
indian
in
paint
and
feathers
astride
his
horse
and
gazing
with
wondering
eye
at
a
railroad
train
rushing
along
a
track
the
indian
had
passed
she
remembered
before
the
tide
of
new
life
that
brought
the
railroad
and
were
billy
and
his
kind
doomed
to
pass
she
pondered
before
this
new
tide
of
life
amazingly
industrious
that
was
flooding
in
from
asia
and
europe
at
sacramento
they
stopped
two
weeks
where
billy
drove
team
and
earned
the
money
to
put
them
along
on
their
travels
also
life
in
oakland
and
carmel
close
to
the
salt
edge
of
the
coast
had
spoiled
them
for
the
interior
too
warm
was
their
verdict
of
sacramento
and
they
followed
the
railroad
west
through
a
region
of
to
davisville
here
they
were
lured
aside
and
to
the
north
to
pretty
woodland
where
billy
drove
team
for
a
fruit
farm
and
where
saxon
wrung
from
him
a
reluctant
consent
for
her
to
work
a
few
days
in
the
fruit
harvest
she
made
an
important
and
mystifying
secret
of
what
she
intended
doing
with
her
earnings
and
billy
teased
her
about
it
until
the
matter
passed
from
his
mind
nor
did
she
tell
him
of
a
money
order
inclosed
with
a
certain
blue
slip
of
paper
in
a
letter
to
bud
strothers
they
began
to
suffer
from
the
heat
billy
declared
they
had
strayed
out
of
the
blanket
climate
there
are
no
redwoods
here
saxon
said
we
must
go
west
toward
the
coast
it
is
there
we
find
the
valley
of
the
from
woodland
they
swung
west
and
south
along
the
county
roads
to
the
fruit
paradise
of
vacaville
here
billy
picked
fruit
then
drove
team
and
here
saxon
received
a
letter
and
a
tiny
express
package
from
bud
strothers
when
billy
came
into
camp
from
the
day
work
she
bade
him
stand
still
and
shut
his
eyes
for
a
few
seconds
she
fumbled
and
did
something
to
the
breast
of
his
cotton
once
he
felt
a
slight
prick
as
of
a
pin
point
and
grunted
while
she
laughed
and
bullied
him
to
continue
keeping
his
eyes
shut
close
your
eyes
and
give
me
a
kiss
she
sang
and
then
i
show
you
what
she
kissed
him
and
when
he
looked
down
he
saw
pinned
to
his
shirt
the
gold
medals
he
had
pawned
the
day
they
had
gone
to
the
moving
picture
show
and
received
their
inspiration
to
return
to
the
land
you
darned
kid
he
exclaimed
as
he
caught
her
to
him
so
what
you
blew
your
fruit
money
in
on
an
i
never
guessed
come
here
to
and
thereupon
she
suffered
the
pleasant
mastery
of
his
brawn
and
was
hugged
and
wrestled
with
until
the
coffee
pot
boiled
over
and
she
darted
from
him
to
the
rescue
i
kinda
always
been
a
mite
proud
of
he
confessed
as
he
rolled
his
cigarette
they
take
me
back
to
my
kid
days
when
i
amateured
it
to
beat
the
band
i
was
some
kid
in
them
days
believe
but
say
d
know
they
clean
slipped
my
recollection
oakland
a
thousan
years
away
from
you
an
me
an
ten
then
this
will
bring
you
back
to
it
saxon
said
opening
bud
letter
and
reading
it
aloud
bud
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
billy
knew
the
of
the
strike
so
he
devoted
himself
to
the
details
as
to
which
men
had
got
back
their
jobs
and
which
had
been
blacklisted
to
his
own
amazement
he
had
been
taken
back
and
was
now
driving
billy
horses
still
more
amazing
was
the
further
information
he
had
to
impart
the
old
foreman
of
the
west
oakland
stables
had
died
and
since
then
two
other
foremen
had
done
nothing
but
make
messes
of
everything
the
point
of
all
which
was
that
the
boss
had
spoken
that
day
to
bud
regretting
the
disappearance
of
billy
do
make
no
mistake
bud
wrote
the
boss
is
onto
all
your
curves
i
bet
he
knows
every
scab
you
slugged
just
the
same
he
says
to
me
strothers
if
you
ai
at
liberty
to
give
me
his
address
just
write
yourself
and
tell
him
for
me
to
come
a
running
i
give
him
a
hundred
and
a
month
to
take
hold
the
saxon
waited
with
anxiety
when
the
letter
was
finished
billy
stretched
out
leaning
on
one
elbow
blew
a
meditative
ring
of
smoke
his
cheap
workshirt
incongruously
brilliant
with
the
gold
of
the
medals
that
flashed
in
the
firelight
was
open
in
front
showing
the
smooth
skin
and
splendid
swell
of
chest
he
glanced
around
at
the
blankets
bowered
in
a
green
screen
and
waiting
at
the
campfire
and
the
blackened
battered
coffee
pot
at
the
hatchet
half
buried
in
a
tree
trunk
and
lastly
at
saxon
his
eyes
embraced
her
then
into
them
came
a
slow
expression
of
inquiry
but
she
offered
no
help
well
he
uttered
finally
all
you
got
ta
do
is
write
bud
strothers
an
tell
not
on
the
boss
ugly
an
while
you
about
it
i
send
the
money
to
get
my
watch
out
you
work
out
the
interest
the
overcoat
can
stay
there
an
but
they
did
not
prosper
in
the
interior
heat
they
lost
weight
the
resilience
went
out
of
their
minds
and
bodies
as
billy
expressed
it
their
silk
was
frazzled
so
they
shouldered
their
packs
and
headed
west
across
the
wild
mountains
in
the
berryessa
valley
the
shimmering
heat
waves
made
their
eyes
ache
and
their
heads
so
that
they
traveled
on
in
the
early
morning
and
late
afternoon
still
west
they
headed
over
more
mountains
to
beautiful
napa
valley
the
next
valley
beyond
was
sonoma
where
hastings
had
invited
them
to
his
ranch
and
here
they
would
have
gone
had
not
billy
chanced
upon
a
newspaper
item
which
told
of
the
writer
departure
to
cover
some
revolution
that
was
breaking
out
somewhere
in
mexico
we
see
later
on
billy
said
as
they
turned
northwest
through
the
vineyards
and
orchards
of
napa
valley
we
like
that
millionaire
bert
used
to
sing
about
except
it
time
that
we
got
to
burn
any
direction
is
as
good
as
any
other
only
west
is
three
times
in
the
napa
valley
billy
refused
work
past
helena
saxon
hailed
with
joy
the
unmistakable
redwoods
they
could
see
growing
up
the
small
canyons
that
penetrated
the
western
wall
of
the
valley
at
calistoga
at
the
end
of
the
railroad
they
saw
the
stages
leaving
for
middletown
and
lower
lake
they
debated
their
route
that
way
led
to
lake
county
and
not
toward
the
coast
so
saxon
and
billy
swung
west
through
the
mountains
to
the
valley
of
the
russian
river
coming
out
at
healdsburg
they
lingered
in
the
on
the
rich
bottoms
where
billy
scorned
to
pick
hops
alongside
of
indians
japanese
and
chinese
i
could
work
alongside
of
an
hour
before
i
be
knockin
their
blocks
off
he
explained
besides
this
russian
river
some
nifty
let
pitch
camp
and
go
so
they
idled
their
way
north
up
the
broad
fertile
valley
so
happy
that
they
forgot
that
work
was
ever
necessary
while
the
valley
of
the
moon
was
a
golden
dream
remote
but
sure
some
day
of
realization
at
cloverdale
billy
fell
into
luck
a
combination
of
sickness
and
mischance
found
the
stage
stables
short
a
driver
each
day
the
train
disgorged
passengers
for
the
geysers
and
billy
as
if
accustomed
to
it
all
his
life
took
the
reins
of
six
horses
and
drove
a
full
load
over
the
mountains
in
stage
time
the
second
trip
he
had
saxon
beside
him
on
the
high
boxseat
by
the
end
of
two
weeks
the
regular
driver
was
back
billy
declined
a
took
his
wages
and
continued
north
saxon
had
adopted
a
fox
terrier
puppy
and
named
him
possum
after
the
dog
hastings
had
told
them
about
so
young
was
he
that
he
quickly
became
footsore
and
she
carried
him
until
billy
perched
him
on
top
of
his
pack
and
grumbled
that
possum
was
chewing
his
back
hair
to
a
frazzle
they
passed
through
the
painted
vineyards
of
asti
at
the
end
of
the
and
entered
ukiah
drenched
to
the
skin
by
the
first
winter
rain
say
billy
said
you
remember
the
way
the
roamer
just
skated
along
well
this
summer
done
the
same
thing
gone
by
on
wheels
an
now
up
to
us
to
find
some
place
to
winter
this
ukiah
looks
like
a
pretty
good
burg
we
get
a
room
an
dry
out
an
hustle
around
to
the
stables
an
if
i
locate
anything
we
can
rent
a
shack
an
have
all
winter
to
think
about
where
we
go
next
chapter
xiii
the
winter
proved
much
less
exciting
than
the
one
spent
in
carmel
and
keenly
as
saxon
had
appreciated
the
carmel
folk
she
now
appreciated
them
more
keenly
than
ever
in
ukiah
she
formed
nothing
more
than
superficial
acquaintances
here
people
were
more
like
those
of
the
working
class
she
had
known
in
oakland
or
else
they
were
merely
wealthy
and
herded
together
in
automobiles
there
was
no
democratic
that
pursued
fellowship
disregardful
of
the
caste
of
wealth
yet
it
was
a
more
enjoyable
winter
than
any
she
had
spent
in
oakland
billy
had
failed
to
get
regular
employment
so
she
saw
much
of
him
and
they
lived
a
prosperous
and
happy
existence
in
the
tiny
cottage
they
rented
as
extra
man
at
the
biggest
livery
stable
spare
time
was
so
great
that
he
drifted
into
it
was
hazardous
and
more
than
once
he
was
broke
but
the
table
never
wanted
for
the
best
of
steak
and
coffee
nor
did
they
stint
themselves
for
clothes
them
blamed
farmers
i
got
ta
pass
it
to
billy
grinned
one
day
when
he
had
been
particularly
bested
in
a
horse
deal
they
wo
tear
under
the
wings
the
sons
of
guns
in
the
summer
they
take
in
boarders
an
in
the
winter
they
make
a
good
livin
doin
each
other
up
at
horses
an
i
just
want
to
tell
you
saxon
they
sure
shown
me
a
few
an
i
gettin
tough
under
the
wings
myself
i
never
tear
again
so
as
you
can
notice
it
which
means
one
more
trade
learned
for
yours
truly
i
can
make
a
livin
anywhere
now
tradin
often
billy
had
saxon
out
on
spare
saddle
horses
from
the
stable
and
his
horse
deals
took
them
on
many
trips
into
the
surrounding
country
likewise
she
was
with
him
when
he
was
driving
horses
to
sell
on
commission
and
in
both
their
minds
independently
arose
a
new
idea
concerning
their
pilgrimage
billy
was
the
first
to
broach
it
i
run
into
an
outfit
the
other
day
that
stored
in
town
he
said
an
it
kept
me
thinkin
ever
since
ai
no
use
tryin
to
get
you
to
guess
it
because
you
ca
i
tell
you
the
swellest
outfit
anybody
ever
heard
of
first
of
all
the
wagon
a
peacherino
strong
as
they
make
it
was
made
to
order
upon
puget
sound
an
it
was
tested
out
all
the
way
down
here
no
load
an
no
road
can
strain
it
the
guy
had
consumption
that
had
it
built
a
doctor
an
a
cook
traveled
with
till
he
passed
in
his
checks
here
in
ukiah
two
years
ago
but
say
if
you
could
see
it
every
kind
of
a
contrivance
a
place
for
everything
a
regular
home
on
wheels
now
if
we
could
get
that
an
a
couple
of
plugs
we
could
travel
like
kings
an
laugh
at
the
oh
billy
it
just
what
i
been
dreamin
all
winter
it
would
be
ideal
and
well
sometimes
on
the
road
i
sure
you
ca
help
forgetting
what
a
nice
little
wife
you
got
and
with
a
wagon
i
could
have
all
kinds
of
pretty
clothes
billy
blue
eyes
glowed
a
caress
cloudy
and
warm
as
he
said
quietly
i
ben
thinkin
about
and
you
can
carry
a
rifle
and
shotgun
and
fishing
poles
and
everything
she
rushed
along
and
a
good
big
axe
instead
of
that
hatchet
you
always
complaining
about
and
possum
can
lift
up
his
legs
and
rest
and
but
suppose
you
ca
buy
it
how
much
do
they
want
one
hundred
an
fifty
big
bucks
he
answered
but
dirt
cheap
at
that
it
givin
it
away
i
tell
you
that
rig
was
built
for
a
cent
less
than
four
hundred
an
i
know
in
the
dark
now
if
i
can
put
through
that
dicker
with
caswell
six
horses
say
i
just
got
onto
that
if
he
buys
who
d
think
he
ship
to
to
the
boss
right
to
the
west
oakland
stables
i
goin
to
get
you
to
write
to
him
travelin
as
we
goin
to
i
can
pick
up
bargains
if
the
boss
talk
i
can
make
the
regular
commissions
he
have
to
trust
me
with
a
lot
of
money
though
which
most
likely
he
wo
knowin
all
his
scabs
i
beat
if
he
could
trust
you
to
run
his
stable
i
guess
he
is
afraid
to
let
you
handle
his
money
saxon
said
billy
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
modest
dubiousness
well
anyway
as
i
was
sayin
if
i
can
sell
caswell
six
horses
why
we
can
stand
off
this
month
bills
an
buy

but
horses

queried
anxiously
they
come
later
if
i
have
to
take
a
regular
job
for
two
or
three
months
the
only
trouble
with
that
be
that

run
us
pretty
well
along
into
summer
before
we
could
pull
out
but
come
on
down
town

show
you
the
outfit
right
saxon
saw
the
wagon
and
was
so
infatuated
with
it
that
she
lost
a
night
sleep
from
sheer
insomnia
of
anticipation
then
caswell
six
horses
were
sold
the
month
bills
held
over
and
the
wagon
became
theirs
one
rainy
morning
two
weeks
later
billy
had
scarcely
left
the
house
to
be
gone
on
an
trip
into
the
country
after

was
back

the
street

want
to
show
you
he
drove
down
town
to
a
board
stable
and
took
her
through
to
a
large
roofed
inclosure
in
the
rear
there
he
led
to
her
a
span
of
sturdy
dappled
chestnuts
with
manes
and
tails
oh
the
beauties
the
beauties
saxon
cried
resting
her
cheek
against
the
velvet
muzzle
of
one
while
the
other
roguishly
nuzzled
for
a
share
ai
they

billy
reveled

them
up
and
down

admiring
gaze

head
slowly
in
a
reaction
of
regret

an

as

lamb
an
then
my
knuckles

to
itch
to
land
on
something
now
it
a
whole
lot
sensibler
to

to
that
valley
of
the
moon
an
they
heavy
enough
to
turn
right
into
the
plowin
the
evening
of
the
fight
at
quarter
past
eight
saxon
parted
from
billy
at
quarter
past
nine
with
hot
water
ice
and
everything
ready
in
anticipation
she
heard
the
gate
click
and
billy
step
come
up
the
porch
she
had
agreed
to
the
fight
much
against
her
better
judgment
and
had
regretted
her
consent
every
minute
of
the
hour
she
had
just
waited
so
that
as
she
opened
the
front
door
she
was
expectant
of
any
sort
of
a
terrible
but
the
billy
she
saw
was
precisely
the
billy
she
had
parted
from
there
was
no
fight
she
cried
in
so
evident
disappointment
that
he
laughed
they
was
all
yellin
fake
when
i
left
an
wantin
their
money
well
i
got
you
she
laughed
leading
him
in
though
secretly
she
sighed
farewell
to
hazel
and
hattie
i
stopped
by
the
way
to
get
something
for
you
that
you
been
some
time
billy
said
casually
shut
your
eyes
an
open
your
hand
when
you
open
your
eyes
you
find
it
grand
he
chanted
into
her
hand
something
was
laid
that
was
very
heavy
and
very
cold
and
when
her
eyes
opened
she
saw
it
was
a
stack
of
fifteen
gold
pieces
i
told
you
it
was
like
takin
money
from
a
corpse
he
exulted
as
he
emerged
grinning
from
the
whirlwind
of
punches
whacks
and
hugs
in
which
she
had
enveloped
him
they
was
no
fight
at
all
d
want
to
know
how
long
it
lasted
just
seconds
less
half
a
minute
an
how
many
blows

an
it
was
me
that
done
it
here
i
show
you
it
was
just
like

a
regular

had
taken
his
place
in
the
middle
of
the
room
slightly
crouching

tucked
against

seconds
one
punch
n
a
spankin
pair
of
horses
for
the
best
wife
billy
roberts
ever
had
in
his
long
all
of
saxon
old
physical
worship
of
her
husband
revived
and
doubled
on
itself
many
times
he
was
in
all
truth
a
hero
worthy
to
be
of
that
company
leaping
from
the
beaked
boats
upon
the
bloody
english
sands
the
next
morning
he
was
awakened
by
her
lips
pressed
on
his
left
hand
hey
what
are
you
doin
he
demanded
kissing
hazel
and
hattie
good
morning
she
answered
demurely
and
now
i
going
to
kiss
you
good
and
just
where
did
your
punch
land
show
billy
complied
touching
the
point
of
her
chin
with
his
knuckles
with
both
her
hands
on
his
arm
she
shoved
it
back
and
tried
to
draw
it
forward
sharply
in
similitude
of
a
punch
but
billy
withstrained
her
wait
he
said
you
do
want
to
knock
your
jaw
off
i
show
you
a
quarter
of
an
inch
will
and
at
a
distance
of
a
quarter
of
an
inch
from
her
chin
he
administered
the
slightest
flick
of
a
tap
on
the
instant
saxon
brain
snapped
with
a
white
flash
of
light
while
her
whole
body
relaxed
numb
and
weak
volitionless
sad
her
vision
reeled
and
blurred
the
next
instant
she
was
herself
again
in
her
eyes
terror
and
understanding
and
it
was
at
a
foot
that
you
struck
him
she
murmured
in
a
voice
of
awe
yes
and
with
the
weight
of
my
shoulders
behind
it
billy
laughed
oh
that
here
let
me
show
you
something
he
searched
out
her
solar
plexus
and
did
no
more
than
snap
his
middle
finger
against
it
this
time
she
experienced
a
simple
paralysis
accompanied
by
a
stoppage
of
breath
but
with
a
brain
and
vision
that
remained
perfectly
clear
in
a
moment
however
all
the
unwonted
sensations
were
gone
solar
plexus
billy
elucidated
imagine
what
it
like
when
the
other
fellow
lifts
a
wallop
to
it
all
the
way
from
his
knees
that
the
punch
that
won
the
championship
of
the
world
for
bob
saxon
shuddered
then
resigned
herself
to
billy
playful
demonstration
of
the
weak
points
in
the
human
anatomy
he
pressed
the
tip
of
a
finger
into
the
middle
of
her
forearm
and
she
knew
excruciating
agony
on
either
side
of
her
neck
at
the
base
he
dented
gently
with
his
thumbs
and
she
felt
herself
quickly
growing
unconscious
that
one
of
the
death
touches
of
the
japs
he
told
her
and
went
on
accompanying
grips
and
holds
with
a
running
exposition
the
that
notch
defeated
hackenschmidt
with
i
learned
it
from
farmer
an
here
a
an
here
you
roughhouse
at
a
dance
an
i
the
floor
manager
an
i
got
ta
put
you
one
hand
grasped
her
wrist
the
other
hand
passed
around
and
under
her
forearm
and
grasped
his
own
wrist
and
at
the
first
hint
of
pressure
she
felt
that
her
arm
was
a
about
to
break
that
called
the
along
an
here
the
strong
arm
a
boy
can
down
a
man
with
it
an
if
you
ever
get
into
a
scrap
an
the
other
fellow
gets
your
nose
between
his
teeth
you
do
want
to
lose
your
nose
do
you
well
this
is
what
you
do
quick
as
a
involuntarily
she
closed
her
eyes
as
billy
pressed
into
them
she
could
feel
the
ache
of
a
dull
and
terrible
hurt
if
he
do
let
go
you
just
press
real
hard
an
out
pop
his
eyes
he
blind
as
a
bat
for
the
rest
of
his
life
oh
he
let
go
all
right
all
he
released
her
and
lay
back
laughing
how
d
feel
he
asked
those
ai
boxin
tricks
but
they
all
in
the
game
of
a
i
feel
like
revenge
she
said
trying
to
apply
the
come
along
to
his
arm
when
she
exerted
the
pressure
she
cried
out
with
pain
for
she
had
succeeded
only
in
hurting
herself
billy
grinned
at
her
futility
she
dug
her
thumbs
into
his
neck
in
imitation
of
the
japanese
death
touch
then
gazed
ruefully
at
the
bent
ends
of
her
nails
she
punched
him
smartly
on
the
point
of
the
chin
and
again
cried
out
this
time
to
the
bruise
of
her
knuckles
well
this
ca
hurt
me
she
gritted
through
her
teeth
as
she
assailed
his
solar
plexus
with
her
doubled
fists
by
this
time
he
was
in
a
roar
of
laughter
under
the
sheaths
of
muscles
that
were
as
armor
the
fatal
nerve
center
remained
impervious
go
on
do
it
some
more
he
urged
when
she
had
given
up
breathing
heavily
it
feels
fine
like
you
was
ticklin
me
with
a
all
right
mister
man
she
threatened
balefully
you
can
talk
about
your
grips
and
death
touches
and
all
the
rest
but
that
all
game
i
know
something
that
will
beat
them
all
that
will
make
a
strong
man
as
helpless
as
a
baby
wait
a
minute
till
i
get
it
there
shut
your
eyes
ready
i
wo
be
a
he
waited
with
closed
eyes
and
then
softly
as
rose
petals
fluttering
down
he
felt
her
lips
on
his
mouth
you
win
he
said
in
solemn
ecstasy
and
passed
his
arms
around
her
chapter

in
the
morning
billy
went
down
town
to
pay
for
hazel
and
hattie
it
was
due
to
saxon
impatient
desire
to
see
them
that
he
seemed
to
take
a
remarkably
long
time
about
so
simple
a
transaction
but
she
forgave
him
when
he
arrived
with
the
two
horses
hitched
to
the
camping
wagon
had
to
borrow
the
harness
he
said
pass
possum
up
and
climb
in
i
show
you
the
double
h
outfit
which
is
some
outfit
i
saxon
delight
was
unbounded
and
almost
speechless
as
they
drove
out
into
the
country
behind
the
dappled
chestnuts
with
the
tails
and
manes
the
seat
was
upholstered
and
comfortable
and
billy
raved
about
the
wonders
of
the
efficient
brake
he
trotted
the
team
along
the
hard
county
road
to
show
the
in
them
and
put
them
up
a
steep
earthroad
almost
with
mud
to
prove
that
the
light
belgian
sire
was
not
wanting
in
their
when
saxon
at
last
lapsed
into
complete
silence
he
studied
her
anxiously
with
quick
sidelong
glances
she
sighed
and
asked
when
do
you
think
we
be
able
to
start
maybe
in
two
weeks
or
maybe
in
two
or
three
he
sighed
with
solemn
deliberation

irishman

the
trunk

to
put

it

wagon

horses

stopped
abruptly
and
confusedly
now
billy

sleeve

can

it
in
your
eyes
saxon
demanded
and
indicted
in
mixed
metaphors

it
like
this
sandow
ai
satisfied
madder

hatter

blattin
around
town
that
he
can
lick
me
with
one
hand
tied
behind
an
all
that
kind
of
hot
air
which
ai
the
point
the
point
is
the
is
wild
to
see
a
they
did
get
a
run
for
their
money
last
time
they
fill
the
house
the
managers
has
seen
me
already
that
was
why
i
was
so
long
they
three
hundred
more
waitin
on
the
tree
for
me
to
pick
two
weeks
from
last
night

say
the
word

just
the
same
as
i
told
you
before
he
my
meat
he
still
thinks
i
a
rube
an
that
it
was
a
fluke
but
billy
you
told
me
long
ago
that
fighting

the
silk
out
of
you
that
was
why
you
quit
it
and
stayed
by
not
this
kind
of
fightin
he
answered
i
got
this
one
all
doped
out
i
let
last
till
about
the
seventh
not
that
it
be
necessary
but
just
to
give
the
audience
a
run
for
its
money
of
course
i
get
a
lump
or
two
an
lose
some
skin
then
i
time
to
that
glass
jaw
of
his
an
drop
for
the
count
an
we
be
all
packed
up
an
next
mornin
we
pull
out
what
d
say
aw
come
saturday
night
two
weeks
later
saxon
ran
to
the
door
when
the
gate
clicked
billy
looked
tired
his
hair
was
wet
his
nose
swollen
one
cheek
was
puffed
there
was
skin
missing
from
his
ears
and
both
eyes
were
slightly
bloodshot
i
darned
if
that
boy
did
fool
me
he
said
as
he
placed
the
roll
of
gold
pieces
in
her
hand
and
sat
down
with
her
on
his
knees
some
boy
when
he
gets
extended
instead
of
stoppin
at
the
seventh
he
kept
me
hustlin
till
the
fourteenth
then
i
got
the
way
i
said
it
too
bad
he
got
a
glass
jaw
he
i
thought
an
got
a
wallop
that
made
me
mighty
respectful
from
the
second
round
the
prettiest
little
chop
an
i
ever
saw
but
that
glass
jaw
he
kept
it
in
cotton
wool
till
the
fourteenth
an
then
i
connected
an
say
i
mighty
glad
it
did
last
fourteen
rounds
i
still
got
all
my
silk
i
could
see
that
easy
i
was
breathin
much
an
every
round
was
fast
an
my
legs
was
like
iron
i
could
forty
rounds
you
see
i
never
said
nothin
but
i
been
suspicious
all
the
time
after
that
beatin
the
chicago
terror
gave
nonsense
you
would
have
known
it
long
before
now
saxon
cried
look
at
all
your
boxing
and
wrestling
and
running
at
billy
shook
his
head
with
the
conviction
of
utter
knowledge
that
different
it
do
take
it
outa
you
you
got
ta
be
up
against
the
real
thing
fightin
for
life
round
after
round
with
a
husky

lost
a
thread
of
his
silk
yet
then
if

up
if

legs
is
steady
an
your
heart
ai
burstin
an
you
ai
wobbly
at
all

money
hardest
in
the
end
from
now
on
it
horsebuyin
on
commish
you
an
me
on
the
road
till
we
find
that
valley
of
the
next
morning
early
they
drove
out
of
ukiah
possum
sat
on
the
seat
between
them
his
rosy
mouth
agape
with
excitement
they
had
originally
planned
to
cross
over
to
the
coast
from
ukiah
but
it
was
too
early
in
the
season
for
the
soft
to
be
in
shape
after
the
winter
rains
so
they
turned
east
for
lake
county
their
route
to
extend
north
through
the
upper
sacramento
valley
and
across
the
mountains
into
oregon
then
they
would
circle
west
to
the
coast
where
the
roads
by
that
time
would
be
in
condition
and
come
down
its
length
to
the
golden
gate
all
the
land
was
green
and
and
each
tiny
valley
as
they
entered
the
hills
was
a
garden
huh
billy
remarked
scornfully
to
the
general
landscape
they
say
a
rollin
stone
gathers
no
moss
just
the
same
this
looks
like
some
outfit
we
gathered
never
had
so
much
actual
property
in
my
life
at
one
time
an
them
was
the
days
when
i
was
rollin
hell
even
the
furniture
was
ourn
only
the
clothes
we
stood
up
in
an
some
old
socks
an
saxon
reached
out
and
touched
his
hand
and
he
knew
that
it
was
a
hand
that
loved
his
hand
i
only
one
regret
she
said
you
earned
it
all
yourself
had
nothing
to
do
with
huh
you
had
everything
to
do
with
it
you
like
my
second
in
a
fight
you
keep
me
happy
an
in
condition
a
man
ca
fight
without
a
good
second
to
take
care
of
him
hell
i
would
here
if
it
was
for
you
you
made
me
pull
up
stakes
an
head
out
why
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
myself
dead
an
rotten
by
this
time
or
had
my
neck
stretched
at
san
quentin
over
hittin
some
scab
too
hard
or
something
or
other
an
look
at
me
now
look
at
that
roll
of
greenbacks
he
tapped
his
breast
to
buy
the
boss
some
horses
why
we
takin
an
unendin
vacation
an
makin
a
good
livin
at
the
same
time
an
one
more
trade
i
got
for
oakland
if
i
show
got
the
savve
an
i
have
all
the
frisco
firms
be
after
me
to
buy
for
them
an
it
all
your
fault
you
my
tonic
kid
all
right
all
right
an
if
possum
was
lookin
i
well
who
cares
if
he
does
look
and
billy
leaned
toward
her
sidewise
and
kissed
her
the
way
grew
hard
and
rocky
as
they
began
to
climb
but
the
divide
was
an
easy
one
and
they
soon
dropped
down
the
canyon
of
the
blue
lakes
among
lush
fields
of
golden
poppies
in
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
lay
a
wandering
sheet
of
water
of
intensest
blue
ahead
the
folds
of
hills
interlaced
the
distance
with
a
remote
blue
mountain
rising
in
the
center
of
the
picture
they
asked
questions
of
a
handsome
man
with
curly
gray
hair
who
talked
to
them
in
a
german
accent
while
a
woman
smiled
down
at
them
out
of
a
trellised
high
window
of
the
swiss
cottage
perched
on
the
bank
billy
watered
the
horses
at
a
pretty
hotel
farther
on
where
the
proprietor
came
out
and
talked
and
told
him
he
had
built
it
himself
according
to
the
plans
of
the
man
with
the
curly
gray
hair
who
was
a
san
francisco
architect
goin
up
goin
up
billy
chortled
as
they
drove
on
through
the
winding
hills
past
another
lake
of
intensest
blue
d
notice
the
difference
in
our
treatment
already
between
ridin
an
walkin
with
packs
on
our
backs
with
hazel
an
hattie
an
saxon
an
possum
yours
truly
an
this
wagon
folks
most
likely
take
us
for
millionaires
out
on
a
the
way
widened
broad
pastures
with
grazing
livestock
lay
on
either
hand
then
clear
lake
opened
before
them
like
an
inland
sea
flecked
with
little
squalls
and
flaws
of
wind
from
the
high
mountains
on
the
northern
slopes
of
which
still
glistened
white
snow
patches
i
heard
mrs
hazard
rave
about
lake
geneva
saxon
recalled
but
i
wonder
if
it
is
more
beautiful
than
that
architect
fellow
called
this
the
california
alps
you
remember
billy
confirmed
an
if
i
do
mistake
that
lakeport
showin
up
ahead
an
all
wild
country
an
no
and
no
moon
valleys
here
saxon
criticized
but
it
is
beautiful
oh
so
hell
in
the
dead
of
summer
i
bet
was
billy
opinion
nope
the
country
we
lookin
for
lies
nearer
the
coast
just
the
same
it
is
beautiful
like
a
picture
on
the
wall
what
d
say
we
stop
off
an
go
for
a
swim
this
afternoon
ten
days
later
they
drove
into
williams
in
colusa
county
and
for
the
first
time
again
encountered
a
railroad
billy
was
looking
for
it
for
the
reason
that
at
the
rear
of
the
wagon
walked
two
magnificent
which
he
had
picked
up
for
shipment
to
oakland
too
hot
was
saxon
verdict
as
she
gazed
across
the
shimmering
level
of
the
vast
sacramento
valley
no
redwoods
no
hills
no
forests
no
manzanita
no
madronos
lonely
and
sad
an
like
the
river
islands
billy
interpolated
richer
hell
but
looks
too
much
like
hard
work
it
do
for
those
that
stuck
on
hard
work
god
knows
they
nothin
here
to
induce
a
fellow
to
knock
off
ever
for
a
bit
of
play
no
fishin
no
huntin
nothin
but
work
work
myself
if
i
had
to
live
north
they
drove
through
days
of
heat
and
dust
across
the
california
plains
and
everywhere
was
manifest
the
new
farming
great
irrigation
ditches
dug
and
being
dug
the
land
threaded
by
from
the
mountains
and
many
new
farmhouses
on
small
holdings
newly
fenced
the
bonanza
farms
were
being
broken
up
however
many
of
the
great
estates
remained
five
to
ten
thousand
acres
in
extent
running
from
the
sacramento
bank
to
the
horizon
dancing
in
the
heat
waves
and
studded
with
great
valley
oaks
it
takes
rich
soil
to
make
trees
like
those
a
farmer
told
them
they
had
driven
off
the
road
a
hundred
feet
to
his
tiny
barn
in
order
to
water
hazel
and
hattie
a
sturdy
young
orchard
covered
most
of
his
ten
acres
though
a
goodly
portion
was
devoted
to
whitewashed
henhouses
and
wired
runways
wherein
hundreds
of
chickens
were
to
be
seen
he
had
just
begun
work
on
a
small
frame
dwelling
i
took
a
vacation
when
i
bought
he
explained
and
planted
the
trees
then
i
went
back
to
work
an
stayed
with
it
till
the
place
was
cleared
now
i
here
for
keeps
an
soon
as
the
house
is
finished
i
send
for
the
wife
she
not
very
well
and
it
will
do
her
good
we
been
planning
and
working
for
years
to
get
away
from
the
he
stopped
in
order
to
give
a
happy
sigh
and
now
we
the
water
in
the
trough
was
warm
from
the
sun
hold
on
the
man
said
do
let
them
drink
that
i
give
it
to
them
stepping
into
a
small
shed
he
turned
an
electric
switch
and
a
motor
the
size
of
a
fruit
box
hummed
into
action
a
stream
of
sparkling
water
splashed
into
the
shallow
main
ditch
of
his
irrigation
system
and
flowed
away
across
the
orchard
through
many
laterals
is
it
beautiful
eh
beautiful
beautiful
the
man
chanted
in
an
ecstasy
it
bud
and
fruit
it
blood
and
life
look
at
it
it
makes
a
gold
mine
laughable
and
a
saloon
a
nightmare
i
know
i
i
used
to
be
a
barkeeper
in
fact
i
been
a
barkeeper
most
of
my
life
how
i
paid
for
this
place
and
i
hated
the
business
all
the
time
i
was
a
farm
boy
and
all
my
life
i
been
wanting
to
get
back
to
it
and
here
i
am
at
he
wiped
his
glasses
the
better
to
behold
his
beloved
water
then
seized
a
hoe
and
strode
down
the
main
ditch
to
open
more
laterals
he
the
funniest
barkeeper
i
ever
seen
billy
commented
i
took
him
for
a
business
man
of
some
sort
must
in
some
kind
of
a
quiet
do
drive
on
right
away
saxon
requested
i
want
to
talk
with
he
came
back
polishing
his
glasses
his
face
beaming
watching
the
water
as
if
fascinated
by
it
it
required
no
more
exertion
on
part
to
start
him
than
had
been
required
on
his
part
to
start
the
motor
the
pioneers
settled
all
this
in
the
early
fifties
he
said
the
mexicans
never
got
this
far
so
it
was
government
land
everybody
got
a
hundred
and
sixty
acres
and
such
acres
the
stories
they
tell
about
how
much
wheat
they
got
to
the
acre
are
almost
unbelievable
then
several
things
happened
the
sharpest
and
steadiest
of
the
pioneers
held
what
they
had
and
added
to
it
from
the
other
fellows
it
takes
a
great
many
quarter
sections
to
make
a
bonanza
farm
it
was
long
before
it
was
all
bonanza
they
were
the
successful
gamblers
saxon
put
in
remembering
mark
hall
words
the
man
nodded
appreciatively
and
continued
the
old
folks
schemed
and
gathered
and
added
the
land
into
the
big
holdings
and
built
the
great
barns
and
mansions
and
planted
the
house
orchards
and
flower
gardens
the
young
folks
were
spoiled
by
so
much
wealth
and
went
away
to
the
cities
to
spend
it
and
old
folks
and
young
united
in
one
thing
in
impoverishing
the
soil
year
after
year
they
scratched
it
and
took
out
bonanza
crops
they
put
nothing
back
all
they
left
was
and
exhausted
land
why
there
big
sections
they
exhausted
and
left
almost
desert
the
bonanza
farmers
are
all
gone
now
thank
the
lord
and
here
where
we
small
farmers
come
into
our
own
it
wo
be
many
years
before
the
whole
valley
will
be
farmed
in
patches
like
mine
look
at
what
doing
land
that
had
ceased
to
grow
wheat
and
we
turn
the
water
on
treat
the
soil
decently
and
see
our
orchards
we
got
the
water
from
the
mountains
and
from
under
the
ground
i
was
reading
an
account
the
other
day
all
life
depends
on
food
all
food
depends
on
water
it
takes
a
thousand
pounds
of
water
to
produce
one
pound
of
food
ten
thousand
pounds
to
produce
one
pound
of
meat
how
much
water
do
you
drink
in
a
year
about
a
ton
but
you
eat
about
two
hundred
pounds
of
vegetables
and
two
hundred
pounds
of
meat
a
year
which
means
you
consume
one
hundred
tons
of
water
in
the
vegetables
and
one
thousand
tons
in
the
meat
which
means
that
it
takes
eleven
hundred
and
one
tons
of
water
each
year
to
keep
a
small
woman
like
you
gee
was
all
billy
could
say
you
see
how
population
depends
upon
water
the
went
on
well
we
got
the
water
immense
subterranean
supplies
and
in
not
many
years
this
valley
will
be
populated
as
thick
as
fascinated
by
the
stream
sluiced
out
of
the
earth
and
back
to
the
earth
by
the
droning
motor
he
forgot
his
discourse
and
stood
and
gazed
rapt
and
unheeding
while
his
visitors
drove
on
an
him
a
billy
marveled
he
can
sure
sling
the
temperance
dope
if
anybody
should
ask
it
lovely
to
think
about
all
that
water
and
all
the
happy
people
that
will
come
here
to
live
but
it
ai
the
valley
of
the
moon
billy
laughed
no
she
responded
they
do
have
to
irrigate
in
the
valley
of
the
moon
unless
for
alfalfa
and
such
crops
what
we
want
is
the
water
bubbling
naturally
from
the
ground
and
crossing
the
farm
in
little
brooks
and
on
the
boundary
a
fine
big
creek
with
trout
in
it
billy
took
her
up
an
willows
and
trees
of
all
kinds
growing
along
the
edges
and
here
a
riffle
where
you
can
flip
out
trout
and
there
a
deep
pool
where
you
can
swim
and
kingfishers
an
rabbits
comin
down
to
drink
an
maybe
a
and
meadowlarks
in
the
pasture
saxon
added
and
mourning
doves
in
the
trees
we
must
have
mourning
doves
and
the
big
gray
gee
that
valley
of
the
moon
goin
to
be
some
valley
billy
meditated
flicking
a
fly
away
with
his
whip
from
hattie
side
think
we
ever
find
it
saxon
nodded
her
head
with
great
certitude
just
as
the
jews
found
the
promised
land
and
the
mormons
utah
and
the
pioneers
california
you
remember
the
last
advice
we
got
when
we
left
oakland
is
them
that
looks
that
finds
chapter
xv
ever
north
through
a
fat
and
flourishing
rejuvenated
land
stopping
at
the
towns
of
willows
red
bluff
and
redding
crossing
the
counties
of
colusa
glenn
tehama
and
shasta
went
the
spruce
wagon
drawn
by
the
dappled
chestnuts
with
manes
and
tails
billy
picked
up
only
three
horses
for
shipment
although
he
visited
many
farms
and
saxon
talked
with
the
women
while
he
looked
over
the
stock
with
the
men
and
saxon
grew
the
more
convinced
that
the
valley
she
sought
lay
not
there
at
redding
they
crossed
the
sacramento
on
a
cable
ferry
and
made
a
day
scorching
traverse
through
rolling
and
flat
tablelands
the
heat
grew
more
insupportable
and
the
trees
and
shrubs
were
blasted
and
dead
then
they
came
again
to
the
sacramento
where
the
great
smelters
of
kennett
explained
the
destruction
of
the
vegetation
they
climbed
out
of
the
smelting
town
where
eyrie
houses
perched
insecurely
on
a
precipitous
landscape
it
was
a
broad
road
that
took
them
up
a
grade
miles
long
and
plunged
down
into
the
canyon
of
the
sacramento
the
road
and
hewn
out
of
the
canyon
wall
grew
so
narrow
that
billy
worried
for
fear
of
meeting
teams
far
below
the
river
frothed
and
flowed
over
pebbly
shallows
or
broke
tumultuously
over
boulders
and
cascades
in
its
race
for
the
great
valley
they
had
left
behind
sometimes
on
the
wider
stretches
of
road
saxon
drove
and
billy
walked
to
lighten
the
load
she
insisted
on
taking
her
turns
at
walking
and
when
he
breathed
the
panting
mares
on
the
steep
and
saxon
stood
by
their
heads
caressing
them
and
cheering
them
billy
joy
was
too
deep
for
any
turn
of
speech
as
he
gazed
at
his
beautiful
horses
and
his
glowing
girl
trim
and
colorful
in
her
golden
brown
corduroy
the
brown
corduroy
calves
swelling
sweetly
under
the
abbreviated
slim
skirt
and
when
her
answering
look
of
happiness
came
to
him
a
sudden
dimness
in
her
straight
gray
eyes
he
was
overmastered
by
the
knowledge
that
he
must
say
something
or
burst
o
you
kid
he
cried
and
with
radiant
face
she
answered
o
you
kid
they
camped
one
night
in
a
deep
dent
in
the
canyon
where
was
snuggled
a
village
and
where
a
toothless
ancient
gazing
with
faded
eyes
at
their
traveling
outfit
asked
be
you
showin
they
passed
castle
crags
and
glowing
red
against
the
palpitating
blue
sky
they
caught
their
first
glimpse
of
mt
shasta
a
rising
a
sunset
dream
between
and
beyond
green
interlacing
walls
of
canyon
a
landmark
destined
to
be
with
them
for
many
days
at
unexpected
turns
after
mounting
some
steep
grade
shasta
would
appear
again
still
distant
now
showing
two
peaks
and
glacial
fields
of
shimmering
white
miles
and
miles
and
days
and
days
they
climbed
with
shasta
ever
developing
new
forms
and
phases
in
her
summer
snows
a
moving
picture
in
the
sky
said
billy
at
last
oh
it
is
all
so
beautiful
sighed
saxon
but
there
are
no
they
encountered
a
plague
of
butterflies
and
for
days
drove
through
untold
millions
of
the
fluttering
beauties
that
covered
the
road
with
uniform
and
ever
the
road
seemed
to
rise
under
the
noses
of
the
snorting
mares
filling
the
air
with
noiseless
flight
drifting
down
the
breeze
in
clouds
of
brown
and
yellow
as
snow
and
piling
in
mounds
against
the
fences
ever
driven
to
float
helplessly
on
the
irrigation
ditches
along
the
roadside
hazel
and
hattie
soon
grew
used
to
them
though
possum
never
ceased
being
made
frantic
huh
who
ever
heard
of
horses
billy
chaffed
worth
fifty
bucks
more
on
their
wait
till
you
get
across
the
oregon
line
into
the
rogue
river
valley
they
were
told
there
god
paradise
climate
scenery
and
fruit
ranches
that
yield
two
hundred
per
cent
on
a
valuation
of
five
hundred
dollars
an
gee
billy
said
when
he
had
driven
on
out
of
hearing
that
too
rich
for
our
and
saxon
said
i
do
know
about
apples
in
the
valley
of
the
moon
but
i
do
know
that
the
yield
is
ten
thousand
per
cent
of
happiness
on
a
valuation
of
one
billy
one
saxon
a
hazel
a
hattie
and
a
through
siskiyou
county
and
across
high
mountains
they
came
to
ashland
and
medford
and
camped
beside
the
wild
rogue
river
this
is
wonderful
and
glorious
pronounced
saxon
but
it
is
not
the
valley
of
the
nope
it
ai
the
valley
of
the
moon
agreed
billy
and
he
said
it
on
the
evening
of
the
day
he
hooked
a
monster
steelhead
standing
to
his
neck
in
the
water
of
the
rogue
and
fighting
for
forty
minutes
with
screaming
reel
ere
he
drew
his
finny
prize
to
the
bank
and
with
the
of
a
comanche
jumped
and
clutched
it
by
the
gills
that
looks
finds
predicted
saxon
as
they
drew
north
out
of
grant
pass
and
held
north
across
the
mountains
and
fruitful
oregon
valleys
one
day
in
camp
by
the
umpqua
river
billy
bent
over
to
begin
skinning
the
first
deer
he
had
ever
shot
he
raised
his
eyes
to
saxon
and
remarked
if
i
did
know
california
i
guess
oregon
suit
me
from
the
ground
in
the
evening
replete
with
deer
meat
resting
on
his
elbow
and
smoking
his
cigarette
he
said
maybe
they
ai
no
valley
of
the
moon
an
if
they
ai
what
of
it
we
could
keep
on
this
way
forever
i
do
ask
nothing
there
is
a
valley
of
the
moon
saxon
answered
soberly
and
we
are
going
to
find
it
we
got
to
why
billy
it
would
never
do
never
to
settle
down
there
would
be
no
little
hazels
and
little
hatties
nor
little
billies
nor
little
saxons
billy
interjected
nor
little
possums
she
hurried
on
nodding
her
head
and
reaching
out
a
caressing
hand
to
where
the
fox
terrier
was
ecstatically
gnawing
a
a
vicious
snarl
and
a
wicked
snap
that
barely
missed
her
fingers
were
her
reward
possum
she
cried
in
sharp
reproof
again
extending
her
hand
do
billy
warned
he
ca
help
it
and
he
likely
to
get
you
next
even
more
compelling
was
the
menacing
threat
that
possum
growled
his
jaws
the
bone
eyes
blazing
insanely
the
hair
rising
stiffly
on
his
neck
it
a
good
dog
that
sticks
up
for
its
bone
billy
championed
i
would
care
to
own
one
that
but
it
my
possum
saxon
protested
and
he
loves
me
besides
he
must
love
me
more
than
an
old
bone
and
he
must
mind
here
you
possum
give
me
that
bone
give
me
that
bone
sir
her
hand
went
out
gingerly
and
the
growl
rose
in
volume
and
key
till
it
culminated
in
a
snap
i
tell
you
it
instinct
billy
repeated
he
does
love
you
but
he
just
ca
help
doin
he
got
a
right
to
defend
his
bones
from
strangers
but
not
from
his
mother
saxon
argued
i
shall
make
him
give
up
that
bone
to
fox
terriers
is
awful
highstrung
saxon
you
likely
get
him
but
she
was
obstinately
set
in
her
purpose
she
picked
up
a
short
stick
of
firewood
now
sir
give
me
that
she
threatened
with
the
stick
and
the
dog
growling
became
ferocious
again
he
snapped
then
crouched
back
over
his
bone
saxon
raised
the
stick
as
if
to
strike
him
and
he
suddenly
abandoned
the
bone
rolled
over
on
his
back
at
her
feet
four
legs
in
the
air
his
ears
lying
meekly
back
his
eyes
swimming
and
eloquent
with
submission
and
appeal
my
god
billy
breathed
in
solemn
awe
look
at
it
presenting
his
solar
plexus
to
you
his
vitals
an
his
life
all
defense
down
as
much
as
sayin
i
am
stamp
on
me
kick
the
life
outa
me
i
love
you
i
am
your
slave
but
i
just
ca
help
defendin
my
bone
my
me
kill
me
but
i
ca
help
saxon
was
melted
tears
were
in
her
eyes
as
she
stooped
and
gathered
the
mite
of
an
animal
in
her
arms
possum
was
in
a
frenzy
of
agitation
whining
trembling
writhing
twisting
licking
her
face
all
for
forgiveness
heart
of
gold
with
a
rose
in
his
mouth
saxon
crooned
burying
her
face
in
the
soft
and
quivering
bundle
of
sensibilities
mother
is
sorry
she
never
bother
you
again
that
way
there
there
little
love
see
there
your
bone
take
she
put
him
down
but
he
hesitated
between
her
and
the
bone
patently
looking
to
her
for
surety
of
permission
yet
continuing
to
tremble
in
the
terrible
struggle
between
duty
and
desire
that
seemed
tearing
him
asunder
not
until
she
repeated
that
it
was
all
right
and
nodded
her
head
consentingly
did
he
go
to
the
bone
and
once
a
minute
later
he
raised
his
head
with
a
sudden
startle
and
gazed
inquiringly
at
her
she
nodded
and
smiled
and
possum
with
a
happy
sigh
of
satisfaction
dropped
his
head
down
to
the
precious
that
mercedes
was
right
when
she
said
men
fought
over
jobs
like
dogs
over
bones
billy
enunciated
slowly
it
instinct
why
i
no
more
help
reaching
my
fist
to
the
point
of
a
scab
jaw
than
could
possum
from
snappin
at
you
they
no
explainin
it
what
a
man
has
to
he
has
to
the
fact
that
he
does
a
thing
shows
he
had
to
do
it
whether
he
can
explain
it
or
not
you
remember
hall
could
explain
why
he
stuck
that
stick
between
timothy
mcmanus
legs
in
the
foot
race
what
a
man
has
to
he
has
to
that
all
i
know
about
it
i
never
had
no
earthly
reason
to
beat
up
that
lodger
we
had
jimmy
harmon
he
was
a
good
guy
square
an
all
right
but
i
just
had
to
with
the
strike
to
smash
an
everything
so
bitter
inside
me
that
i
could
taste
it
i
never
told
you
but
i
saw
once
after
i
got
out
when
my
arms
was
mendin
i
went
down
to
the
roundhouse
an
waited
for
to
come
in
off
a
run
an
apologized
to
now
why
did
i
apologize
i
do
know
except
for
the
same
reason
i
punched
i
just
had
and
so
billy
expounded
the
why
of
like
in
terms
of
realism
in
the
camp
by
the
umpqua
river
while
possum
expounded
it
in
similar
terms
of
fang
and
appetite
on
the
rib
of
deer
chapter
xvi
with
possum
on
the
seat
beside
her
saxon
drove
into
the
town
of
roseburg
she
drove
at
a
walk
at
the
back
of
the
wagon
were
tied
two
heavy
young
behind
half
a
dozen
more
marched
free
and
the
rear
was
brought
up
by
billy
astride
a
ninth
horse
all
these
he
shipped
from
roseburg
to
the
west
oakland
stables
it
was
in
the
umpqua
valley
that
they
heard
the
parable
of
the
white
sparrow
the
farmer
who
told
it
was
elderly
and
flourishing
his
farm
was
a
model
of
orderliness
and
system
afterwards
billy
heard
neighbors
estimate
his
wealth
at
a
quarter
of
a
million
you
heard
the
story
of
the
farmer
and
the
white
sparrow
he
asked
billy
at
dinner
never
heard
of
a
white
sparrow
even
billy
answered
i
must
say
they
pretty
rare
the
farmer
owned
but
here
the
story
once
there
was
a
farmer
who
was
making
much
of
a
success
things
just
did
seem
to
go
right
till
at
last
one
day
he
heard
about
the
wonderful
white
sparrow
it
seems
that
the
white
sparrow
comes
out
only
just
at
daybreak
with
the
first
light
of
dawn
and
that
it
brings
all
kinds
of
good
luck
to
the
farmer
that
is
fortunate
enough
to
catch
it
next
morning
our
farmer
was
up
at
daybreak
and
before
looking
for
it
and
do
you
know
he
sought
for
it
continually
for
months
and
months
and
never
caught
even
a
glimpse
of
their
host
shook
his
head
no
he
never
found
it
but
he
found
so
many
things
about
the
farm
needing
attention
and
which
he
attended
to
before
breakfast
that
before
he
knew
it
the
farm
was
prospering
and
it
was
long
before
the
mortgage
was
paid
off
and
he
was
starting
a
bank
that
afternoon
as
they
drove
along
billy
was
plunged
in
a
deep
reverie
oh
i
got
the
point
all
right
he
said
finally
an
yet
i
satisfied
of
course
they
was
a
white
sparrow
but
by
getting
up
early
an
attendin
to
things
he
been
slack
about
before
oh
i
got
it
all
right
an
yet
saxon
if
that
what
a
farmer
life
means
i
want
to
find
no
moon
valley
life
ai
hard
work
daylight
to
dark
hard
at
it
might
just
as
well
be
in
the
city
what
the
difference
al
the
time
you
got
to
yourself
is
for
sleepin
an
when
sleepin
you
not
enjoyin
yourself
an
what
it
matter
where
you
sleep
you
deado
might
as
well
be
dead
an
done
with
it
as
work
your
head
off
that
way
i
sooner
stick
to
the
road
an
shoot
a
deer
catch
a
trout
once
in
a
while
an
lie
on
my
back
in
the
shade
laugh
with
you
an
have
fun
with
you
an
an
go
swimmin
an
i
a
willin
worker
too
but
they
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
a
decent
amount
of
work
an
workin
your
head
saxon
was
in
full
accord
she
looked
back
on
her
years
of
toil
and
contrasted
them
with
the
joyous
life
she
had
lived
on
the
road
we
do
want
to
be
rich
she
said
let
them
hunt
their
white
sparrows
in
the
sacramento
islands
and
the
irrigation
valleys
when
we
get
up
early
in
the
valley
of
the
moon
it
will
be
to
hear
the
birds
sing
and
sing
with
them
and
if
we
work
hard
at
times
it
will
be
only
so
that
we
have
more
time
to
play
and
when
you
go
swimming
i
going
with
you
and
we
play
so
hard
that
we
be
glad
to
work
for
i
gettin
plumb
dried
out
billy
announced
mopping
the
sweat
from
his
sunburned
forehead
what
d
say
we
head
for
the
coast
west
they
turned
dropping
down
wild
mountain
gorges
from
the
height
of
land
of
the
interior
valleys
so
fearful
was
the
road
that
on
one
stretch
of
seven
miles
they
passed
ten
automobiles
billy
would
not
force
the
mares
and
promptly
camped
beside
a
brawling
stream
from
which
he
whipped
two
trout
at
a
time
here
saxon
caught
her
first
big
trout
she
had
been
accustomed
to
landing
them
up
to
nine
and
ten
inches
and
the
screech
of
the
reel
when
the
big
one
was
hooked
caused
her
to
cry
out
in
startled
surprise
billy
came
up
the
riffle
to
her
and
gave
counsel
several
minutes
later
cheeks
flushed
and
eyes
dancing
with
excitement
saxon
dragged
the
big
fellow
carefully
from
the
water
edge
into
the
dry
sand
here
it
threw
the
hook
out
and
flopped
tremendously
until
she
fell
upon
it
and
captured
it
in
her
hands
sixteen
inches
billy
said
as
she
held
it
up
proudly
for
inspection
hey
what
are
you
goin
to
do
wash
off
the
sand
of
course
was
her
answer
better
put
it
in
the
basket
he
advised
then
closed
his
mouth
and
grimly
watched
she
stooped
by
the
side
of
the
stream
and
dipped
in
the
splendid
fish
it
flopped
there
was
a
convulsive
movement
on
her
part
and
it
was
gone
oh
saxon
cried
in
chagrin
them
that
finds
should
hold
quoth
billy
i
do
care
she
replied
it
was
a
bigger
one
than
you
ever
caught
oh
i
not
denyin
you
a
peach
at
fishin
he
drawled
you
caught
me
did
you
i
do
know
about
that
she
retorted
maybe
it
was
like
the
man
who
was
arrested
for
catching
trout
out
of
season
his
defense
was
self
billy
pondered
but
did
not
see
the
trout
attacked
him
she
explained
billy
grinned
fifteen
minutes
later
he
said
you
sure
handed
me
a
hot
the
sky
was
overcast
and
as
they
drove
along
the
bank
of
the
coquille
river
the
fog
suddenly
enveloped
them
whoof
billy
exhaled
joyfully
ai
it
great
i
can
feel
myself
moppin
it
up
like
a
dry
sponge
i
never
appreciated
fog
saxon
held
out
her
arms
to
receive
it
making
motions
as
if
she
were
bathing
in
the
gray
mist
i
never
thought
i
grow
tired
of
the
sun
she
said
but
we
had
more
than
our
share
the
last
few
ever
since
we
hit
the
sacramento
valley
billy
affirmed
too
much
sun
ai
good
i
worked
that
out
sunshine
is
like
liquor
did
you
ever
notice
how
good
you
felt
when
the
sun
come
out
after
a
week
of
cloudy
weather
well
that
sunshine
was
just
like
a
jolt
of
whiskey
had
the
same
effect
made
you
feel
good
all
over
now
when
you
swimmin
come
out
an
lay
in
the
sun
how
good
you
feel
that
because
lappin
up
a
but
suppose
you
lay
there
in
the
sand
a
couple
of
hours
you
do
feel
so
good
you
so
it
takes
you
a
long
time
to
dress
you
go
home
draggin
your
legs
an
rotten
with
all
the
life
sapped
outa
you
what
that
it
the
katzenjammer
you
been
soused
to
the
ears
in
sunshine
like
so
much
whiskey
an
now
you
payin
for
it
that
straight
that
why
fog
in
the
climate
is
then
we
been
drunk
for
months
saxon
said
and
now
we
going
to
sober
you
bet
why
saxon
i
can
do
two
days
work
in
one
in
this
look
at
the
mares
blame
me
if
they
ai
perkin
up
vainly
saxon
eye
roved
the
pine
forest
in
search
of
her
beloved
redwoods
they
would
find
them
down
in
california
they
were
told
in
the
town
of
bandon
then
we
too
far
north
said
saxon
we
must
go
south
to
find
our
valley
of
the
and
south
they
went
along
roads
that
steadily
grew
worse
through
the
dairy
country
of
langlois
and
through
thick
pine
forests
to
port
orford
where
saxon
picked
jeweled
agates
on
the
beach
while
billy
caught
enormous
rockcod
no
railroads
had
yet
penetrated
this
wild
region
and
the
way
south
grew
wilder
and
wilder
at
gold
beach
they
encountered
their
old
friend
the
rogue
river
which
they
ferried
across
where
it
entered
the
pacific
still
wilder
became
the
country
still
more
terrible
the
road
still
farther
apart
the
isolated
farms
and
clearings
and
here
were
neither
asiatics
nor
europeans
the
scant
population
consisted
of
the
original
settlers
and
their
descendants
more
than
one
old
man
or
woman
saxon
talked
with
who
could
remember
the
trip
across
the
plains
with
the
plodding
oxen
west
they
had
fared
until
the
pacific
itself
had
stopped
them
and
here
they
had
made
their
clearings
built
their
rude
houses
and
settled
in
them
farthest
west
had
been
reached
old
customs
had
changed
little
there
were
no
railways
no
automobile
as
yet
had
ventured
their
perilous
roads
eastward
between
them
and
the
populous
interior
valleys
lay
the
wilderness
of
the
coast
range
a
game
paradise
billy
heard
though
he
declared
that
the
very
road
he
traveled
was
game
paradise
enough
for
him
had
he
not
halted
the
horses
turned
the
reins
over
to
saxon
and
shot
an
buck
from
the
south
of
gold
beach
climbing
a
narrow
road
through
the
virgin
forest
they
heard
from
far
above
the
jingle
of
bells
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
billy
found
a
place
wide
enough
to
turn
out
here
he
waited
while
the
merry
bells
descending
the
mountain
rapidly
came
near
they
heard
the
grind
of
brakes
the
soft
thud
of
horses
hoofs
once
a
sharp
cry
of
the
driver
and
once
a
woman
laughter
some
driver
some
driver
billy
muttered
i
take
my
hat
off
to
whoever
he
is
hittin
a
pace
like
that
on
a
road
like
listen
to
that
he
got
powerful
zocie
that
was
a
some
springs
saxon
some
springs
where
the
road
zigzagged
above
they
glimpsed
through
the
trees
four
sorrel
horses
trotting
swiftly
and
the
flying
wheels
of
a
small
trap
at
the
bend
of
the
road
the
leaders
appeared
again
swinging
wide
on
the
curve
the
wheelers
flashed
into
view
and
the
light
rig
then
the
whole
affair
straightened
out
and
thundered
down
upon
them
across
a
narrow
in
the
front
seat
were
a
man
and
woman
in
the
rear
seat
a
japanese
was
squeezed
in
among
suit
cases
rods
guns
saddles
and
a
typewriter
case
while
above
him
and
all
about
him
fastened
most
intricately
sprouted
a
prodigious
crop
of
and
it
and
hastings
saxon
cried
whoa
hastings
yelled
putting
on
the
brake
and
gathering
his
horses
in
to
a
stop
alongside
greetings
flew
back
and
forth
in
which
the
japanese
whom
they
had
last
seen
on
the
roamer
at
rio
vista
gave
and
received
his
share
different
from
the
sacramento
islands
eh
hastings
said
to
saxon
nothing
but
old
american
stock
in
these
mountains
and
they
changed
any
as
john
fox
said
they
our
contemporary
ancestors
our
old
folks
were
just
like
and
hastings
between
them
told
of
their
long
drive
they
were
out
two
months
then
and
intended
to
continue
north
through
oregon
and
washington
to
the
canadian
boundary
then
we
ship
our
horses
and
come
home
by
train
concluded
hastings
but
the
way
you
drive
you
oughta
be
a
whole
lot
further
along
than
this
billy
criticized
but
we
keep
stopping
off
everywhere
hastings
explained
we
went
in
to
the
hoopa
reservation
said
hastings
and
canoed
down
the
trinity
and
klamath
rivers
to
the
ocean
and
just
now
come
out
from
two
weeks
in
the
real
wilds
of
curry
you
must
go
in
hastings
advised
you
get
to
mountain
ranch
and
you
can
turn
in
from
there
no
roads
though
you
have
to
pack
your
horses
but
it
full
of
game
i
shot
five
mountain
lions
and
two
bear
to
say
nothing
of
deer
and
there
are
small
herds
of
elk
no
i
did
shoot
any
they
protected
these
horns
i
got
from
the
old
hunters
i
tell
you
all
about
and
while
the
men
talked
saxon
and
hastings
were
not
idle
found
your
valley
of
the
moon
yet
the
writer
wife
asked
as
they
were
saying
saxon
shook
her
head
you
will
find
it
if
you
go
far
enough
and
be
sure
you
go
as
far
as
sonoma
valley
and
our
ranch
then
if
you
have
found
it
yet
see
what
we
can
three
weeks
later
with
a
bigger
record
of
mountain
lions
and
bear
than
hastings
to
his
credit
billy
emerged
from
curry
county
and
drove
across
the
line
into
california
at
once
saxon
found
herself
among
the
redwoods
but
they
were
redwoods
unbelievable
billy
stopped
the
wagon
got
out
and
paced
around
one
feet
he
announced
that
fifteen
in
diameter
and
they
all
like
it
only
bigger
no
there
a
runt
it
only
about
nine
feet
through
an
they
hundreds
of
feet
when
i
die
billy
you
must
bury
me
in
a
redwood
grove
saxon
adjured
i
ai
goin
to
let
you
die
before
i
do
he
assured
her
an
then
we
leave
it
in
our
wills
for
us
both
to
be
buried
that
chapter
xvii
south
they
held
along
the
coast
hunting
fishing
swimming
and
billy
shipped
his
purchases
on
the
coasting
steamers
through
del
norte
and
humboldt
counties
they
went
and
through
mendocino
into
sonoma
counties
larger
than
eastern
states
threading
the
giant
woods
whipping
innumerable
and
crossing
countless
rich
valleys
ever
saxon
sought
the
valley
of
the
moon
sometimes
when
all
seemed
fair
the
lack
was
a
railroad
sometimes
madrono
and
manzanita
trees
and
usually
there
was
too
much
fog
we
do
want
a
once
in
a
while
she
told
billy
yep
was
his
answer
too
much
fog
might
make
us
soggy
what
after
is
betwixt
an
between
an
we
have
to
get
back
from
the
coast
a
ways
to
find
this
was
in
the
fall
of
the
year
and
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
pacific
at
old
fort
ross
and
entered
the
russian
river
valley
far
below
ukiah
by
way
of
cazadero
and
guerneville
at
santa
rosa
billy
was
delayed
with
the
shipping
of
several
horses
so
that
it
was
not
until
afternoon
that
he
drove
south
and
east
for
sonoma
valley
i
guess
we
no
more
than
make
sonoma
valley
when
it
be
time
to
camp
he
said
measuring
the
sun
with
his
eye
this
is
called
bennett
valley
you
cross
a
divide
from
it
and
come
out
at
glen
ellen
now
this
is
a
mighty
pretty
valley
if
anybody
should
ask
you
an
that
some
nifty
mountain
over
the
mountain
is
all
right
saxon
adjudged
but
all
the
rest
of
the
hills
are
too
bare
and
i
do
see
any
big
trees
it
takes
rich
soil
to
make
big
oh
i
ai
sayin
it
the
valley
of
the
moon
by
a
long
ways
all
the
same
saxon
that
some
mountain
look
at
the
timber
on
it
i
bet
they
deer
i
wonder
where
we
spend
this
winter
saxon
remarked
d
know
i
just
been
thinkin
the
same
thing
let
winter
at
carmel
mark
hall
back
an
so
is
jim
hazard
what
d
say
saxon
nodded
only
you
wo
be
the
man
this
nope
we
can
make
trips
in
good
weather
billy
confirmed
his
face
beaming
with
an
if
that
walkin
poet
of
the
marble
house
is
around
i
sure
get
the
gloves
on
with
just
in
memory
of
the
time
he
walked
me
off
my
legs
oh
oh
saxon
cried
look
billy
look
around
a
bend
in
the
road
came
a
man
in
a
sulky
driving
a
heavy
stallion
the
animal
was
a
bright
with
mane
and
tail
the
tail
almost
swept
the
ground
while
the
mane
was
so
thick
that
it
crested
out
of
the
neck
and
flowed
down
long
and
wavy
he
scented
the
mares
and
stopped
short
head
flung
up
and
armfuls
of
creamy
mane
tossing
in
the
breeze
he
bent
his
head
until
flaring
nostrils
brushed
impatient
knees
and
between
the
ears
could
be
seen
a
mighty
and
incredible
curve
of
neck
again
he
tossed
his
head
fretting
against
the
bit
as
the
driver
turned
widely
aside
for
safety
in
passing
they
could
see
the
blue
glaze
like
a
sheen
on
the
surface
of
the
horse
bright
wild
eyes
and
billy
closed
a
wary
thumb
on
his
reins
and
himself
turned
widely
he
held
up
his
hand
in
signal
and
the
driver
of
the
stallion
stopped
when
well
past
and
over
his
shoulder
talked
with
billy
among
other
things
billy
learned
that
the
stallion
name
was
barbarossa
that
the
driver
was
the
owner
and
that
santa
rosa
was
his
headquarters
there
are
two
ways
to
sonoma
valley
from
here
the
man
directed
when
you
come
to
the
crossroads
the
turn
to
the
left
will
take
you
to
glen
ellen
by
bennett
peak
that
it
rising
from
rolling
stubble
fields
bennett
peak
towered
hot
in
the
sun
a
row
of
bastion
hills
leaning
against
its
base
but
hills
and
mountains
on
that
side
showed
bare
and
heated
though
beautiful
with
the
sunburnt
tawniness
of
california
the
turn
to
the
right
will
take
you
to
glen
ellen
too
only
longer
and
steeper
grades
but
your
mares
do
look
as
though
bother
which
is
the
prettiest
way
saxon
asked
oh
the
right
hand
road
by
all
means
said
the
man
that
sonoma
mountain
there
and
the
road
skirts
it
pretty
well
up
and
goes
through
cooper
billy
did
not
start
immediately
after
they
had
said
and
he
and
saxon
heads
over
shoulders
watched
the
roused
barbarossa
plunging
mutinously
on
toward
santa
rosa
gee
billy
said
i
like
to
be
up
here
next
at
the
crossroads
billy
hesitated
and
looked
at
saxon
what
if
it
is
longer
she
said
look
how
beautiful
it
is
all
covered
with
green
woods
and
i
just
know
those
are
redwoods
in
the
canyons
you
never
can
tell
the
valley
of
the
moon
might
be
right
up
there
somewhere
and
it
would
never
do
to
miss
it
just
in
order
to
save
half
an
they
took
the
turn
to
the
right
and
began
crossing
a
series
of
steep
foothills
as
they
approached
the
mountain
there
were
signs
of
a
greater
abundance
of
water
they
drove
beside
a
running
stream
and
though
the
vineyards
on
the
hills
were
the
farmhouses
in
the
hollows
and
on
the
levels
were
grouped
about
with
splendid
trees
maybe
it
sounds
funny
saxon
observed
but
i
beginning
to
love
that
mountain
already
it
almost
seems
as
if
i
seen
it
before
somehow
it
so
satisfying
oh
crossing
a
bridge
and
rounding
a
sharp
turn
they
were
suddenly
enveloped
in
a
mysterious
coolness
and
gloom
all
about
them
arose
stately
trunks
of
redwood
the
forest
floor
was
a
rosy
carpet
of
autumn
fronds
occasional
shafts
of
sunlight
penetrating
the
deep
shade
warmed
the
somberness
of
the
grove
alluring
paths
led
off
among
the
trees
and
into
cozy
nooks
made
by
circles
of
red
columns
growing
around
the
dust
of
vanished
ancestors
witnessing
the
titanic
dimensions
of
those
ancestors
by
the
girth
of
the
circles
in
which
they
stood
out
of
the
grove
they
pulled
to
the
steep
divide
which
was
no
more
than
a
buttress
of
sonoma
mountain
the
way
led
on
through
rolling
uplands
and
across
small
dips
and
canyons
all
well
wooded
and
with
water
in
places
the
road
was
muddy
from
wayside
springs
the
mountain
a
sponge
said
billy
here
it
is
the
of
dry
summer
an
the
ground
just
leakin
i
know
i
never
been
here
before
saxon
communed
aloud
but
all
so
familiar
so
i
must
have
dreamed
it
and
there
madronos
a
whole
grove
and
manzanita
why
i
feel
just
as
if
i
was
coming
home
oh
billy
if
it
should
turn
out
to
be
our
plastered
against
the
side
of
a
mountain
he
queried
with
a
skeptical
laugh
no
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
on
the
way
to
our
valley
because
the
way
all
ways
to
our
valley
must
be
beautiful
and
this
i
seen
it
all
before
dreamed
it
great
he
said
sympathetically
i
would
trade
a
square
mile
of
this
kind
of
country
for
the
whole
sacramento
valley
with
the
river
islands
thrown
in
and
middle
river
for
good
measure
if
they
ai
deer
up
there
i
miss
my
guess
an
where
they
springs
they
streams
streams
means
they
passed
a
large
and
comfortable
farmhouse
surrounded
by
wandering
barns
and
went
on
under
forest
arches
and
emerged
beside
a
field
with
which
saxon
was
instantly
enchanted
it
flowed
in
a
gentle
concave
from
the
road
up
the
mountain
its
farther
boundary
an
unbroken
line
of
timber
the
field
glowed
like
rough
gold
in
the
approaching
sunset
and
near
the
middle
of
it
stood
a
solitary
great
redwood
with
blasted
top
suggesting
a
nesting
eyrie
for
eagles
the
timber
beyond
clothed
the
mountain
in
solid
green
to
what
they
took
to
be
the
top
but
as
they
drove
on
saxon
looking
back
upon
what
she
called
her
field
saw
the
real
summit
of
sonoma
towering
beyond
the
mountain
behind
her
field
a
mere
spur
upon
the
side
of
the
larger
mass
ahead
and
toward
the
right
across
sheer
ridges
of
the
mountains
separated
by
deep
green
canyons
and
broadening
lower
down
into
rolling
orchards
and
vineyards
they
caught
their
first
sight
of
sonoma
valley
and
the
wild
mountains
that
rimmed
its
eastern
side
to
the
left
they
gazed
across
a
golden
land
of
small
hills
and
valleys
beyond
to
the
north
they
glimpsed
another
portion
of
the
valley
and
still
beyond
the
opposing
wall
of
the
valley
a
range
of
mountains
the
highest
of
which
reared
its
red
and
battered
ancient
crater
against
a
rosy
and
mellowing
sky
from
north
to
southeast
the
mountain
rim
curved
in
the
brightness
of
the
sun
while
saxon
and
billy
were
already
in
the
shadow
of
evening
he
looked
at
saxon
noted
the
ravished
ecstasy
of
her
face
and
stopped
the
horses
all
the
eastern
sky
was
blushing
to
rose
which
descended
upon
the
mountains
touching
them
with
wine
and
ruby
sonoma
valley
began
to
fill
with
a
purple
flood
laving
the
mountain
bases
rising
inundating
drowning
them
in
its
purple
saxon
pointed
in
silence
indicating
that
the
purple
flood
was
the
sunset
shadow
of
sonoma
mountain
billy
nodded
then
chirruped
to
the
mares
and
the
descent
began
through
a
warm
and
colorful
twilight
on
the
elevated
sections
of
the
road
they
felt
the
cool
delicious
breeze
from
the
pacific
forty
miles
away
while
from
each
little
dip
and
hollow
came
warm
breaths
of
autumn
earth
spicy
with
sunburnt
grass
and
fallen
leaves
and
passing
flowers
they
came
to
the
rim
of
a
deep
canyon
that
seemed
to
penetrate
to
the
heart
of
sonoma
mountain
again
with
no
word
spoken
merely
from
watching
saxon
billy
stopped
the
wagon
the
canyon
was
wildly
beautiful
tall
redwoods
lined
its
entire
length
on
its
farther
rim
stood
three
rugged
knolls
covered
with
dense
woods
of
spruce
and
oak
from
between
the
knolls
a
feeder
to
the
main
canyon
and
likewise
fringed
with
redwoods
emerged
a
smaller
canyon
billy
pointed
to
a
stubble
field
that
lay
at
the
feet
of
the
knolls
it
in
fields
like
that
i
seen
my
mares
he
said
they
dropped
down
into
the
canyon
the
road
following
a
stream
that
sang
under
maples
and
alders
the
sunset
fires
refracted
from
the
of
the
autumn
sky
bathed
the
canyon
with
crimson
in
which
madronos
and
manzanitas
burned
and
smoldered
the
air
was
aromatic
with
laurel
wild
grape
vines
bridged
the
stream
from
tree
to
tree
oaks
of
many
sorts
were
veiled
in
lacy
spanish
moss
ferns
and
brakes
grew
lush
beside
the
stream
from
somewhere
came
the
plaint
of
a
mourning
dove
fifty
feet
above
the
ground
almost
over
their
heads
a
douglas
squirrel
crossed
the
road
a
flash
of
gray
between
two
trees
and
they
marked
the
continuance
of
its
aerial
passage
by
the
bending
of
the
boughs
i
got
a
hunch
said
billy
let
me
say
it
first
saxon
begged
he
waited
his
eyes
on
her
face
as
she
gazed
about
her
in
rapture
we
found
our
valley
she
whispered
was
that
it
he
nodded
but
checked
speech
at
sight
of
a
small
boy
driving
a
cow
up
the
road
a
preposterously
big
shotgun
in
one
hand
in
the
other
as
preposterously
big
a
jackrabbit
how
far
to
glen
ellen
billy
asked
mile
an
a
half
was
the
answer
what
creek
is
this
inquired
saxon
wild
water
it
empties
into
sonoma
creek
half
a
mile
trout
this
from
billy
if
you
know
how
to
catch
grinned
the
boy
deer
up
the
mountain
it
ai
open
season
the
boy
evaded
i
guess
you
never
shot
a
deer
billy
slyly
baited
and
was
rewarded
with
i
got
the
horns
to
deer
shed
their
horns
billy
teased
on
anybody
can
find
i
got
the
meat
on
mine
it
ai
dry
yet
the
boy
broke
off
gazing
with
shocked
eyes
into
the
pit
billy
had
dug
for
him
it
all
right
sonny
billy
laughed
as
he
drove
on
i
ai
the
game
warden
i
buyin
more
leaping
tree
squirrels
more
ruddy
madronos
and
majestic
oaks
more
fairy
circles
of
redwoods
and
still
beside
the
singing
stream
they
passed
a
gate
by
the
roadside
before
it
stood
a
rural
mail
box
on
which
was
lettered
edmund
standing
under
the
rustic
arch
leaning
upon
the
gate
a
man
and
woman
composed
a
pieture
so
arresting
and
beautiful
that
saxon
caught
her
breath
they
were
side
by
side
the
delicate
hand
of
the
woman
curled
in
the
hand
of
the
man
which
looked
as
if
made
to
confer
benedictions
his
face
bore
out
this
impression
a
countenance
with
large
benevolent
gray
eyes
under
a
wealth
of
white
hair
that
shone
like
spun
glass
he
was
fair
and
large
the
little
woman
beside
him
was
daintily
wrought
she
was
as
a
woman
of
the
white
race
can
well
be
with
smiling
eyes
of
bluest
blue
in
quaint
draperies
she
seemed
a
flower
with
her
small
vivid
face
irresistibly
reminding
saxon
of
a
springtime
perhaps
the
picture
made
by
saxon
and
billy
was
equally
arresting
and
beautiful
as
they
drove
down
through
the
golden
end
of
day
the
two
couples
had
eyes
only
for
each
other
the
little
woman
beamed
joyously
the
man
face
glowed
into
the
benediction
that
had
trembled
there
to
saxon
like
the
field
up
the
mountain
like
the
mountain
itself
it
seemed
that
she
had
always
known
this
adorable
pair
she
knew
that
she
loved
them
how
d
do
said
billy
you
blessed
children
said
the
man
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
dear
you
look
sitting
that
was
all
the
wagon
had
passed
by
rustling
down
the
road
which
was
carpeted
with
fallen
leaves
of
maple
oak
and
alder
then
they
came
to
the
meeting
of
the
two
creeks
oh
what
a
place
for
a
home
saxon
cried
pointing
across
wild
water
see
billy
on
that
bench
there
above
the
it
a
rich
bottom
saxon
and
so
is
the
bench
rich
look
at
the
big
trees
on
it
an
they
sure
to
be
drive
over
she
said
forsaking
the
main
road
they
crossed
wild
water
on
a
narrow
bridge
and
continued
along
an
ancient
rutted
road
that
ran
beside
an
equally
ancient
of
split
redwood
rails
they
came
to
a
gate
open
and
off
its
hinges
through
which
the
road
led
out
on
the
bench
this
is
it
i
know
it
saxon
said
with
conviction
drive
in
a
small
whitewashed
farmhouse
with
broken
windows
showed
through
the
trees
talk
about
your
madronos
billy
pointed
to
the
father
of
all
madronos
six
feet
in
diameter
at
its
base
sturdy
and
sound
which
stood
before
the
house
they
spoke
in
low
tones
as
they
passed
around
the
house
under
great
oak
trees
and
came
to
a
stop
before
a
small
barn
they
did
not
wait
to
unharness
tying
the
horses
they
started
to
explore
the
pitch
from
the
bench
to
the
meadow
was
steep
yet
thickly
wooded
with
oaks
and
manzanita
as
they
crashed
through
the
underbrush
they
startled
a
score
of
quail
into
flight
how
about
game
saxon
queried
billy
grinned
and
fell
to
examining
a
spring
which
bubbled
a
clear
stream
into
the
meadow
here
the
ground
was
sunbaked
and
wide
open
in
a
multitude
of
cracks
disappointment
leaped
into
saxon
face
but
billy
crumbling
a
clod
between
his
fingers
had
not
made
up
his
mind
it
rich
he
pronounced
the
cream
of
the
soil
that
been
down
from
the
hills
for
ten
thousan
years
but
he
broke
off
stared
all
about
studying
the
configuration
of
the
meadow
crossed
it
to
the
redwood
trees
beyond
then
came
back
it
no
good
as
it
is
he
said
but
it
the
best
ever
if
handled
right
all
it
needs
is
a
little
common
sense
an
a
lot
of
drainage
this
meadow
a
natural
basin
not
yet
filled
level
they
a
sharp
slope
through
the
redwoods
to
the
creek
come
on
i
show
they
went
through
the
redwoods
and
came
out
on
sonoma
creek
at
this
spot
was
no
singing
the
stream
poured
into
a
quiet
pool
the
willows
on
their
side
brushed
the
water
the
opposite
side
was
a
steep
bank
billy
measured
the
height
of
the
bank
with
his
eye
the
depth
of
the
water
with
a
driftwood
pole
fifteen
feet
he
announced
that
allows
all
kinds
of
from
the
bank
an
it
a
hundred
yards
of
a
swim
up
an
they
followed
down
the
pool
it
emptied
in
a
riffle
across
exposed
bedrock
into
another
pool
as
they
looked
a
trout
flashed
into
the
air
and
back
leaving
a
widening
ripple
on
the
quiet
surface
i
guess
we
wo
winter
in
carmel
billy
said
this
place
was
specially
manufactured
for
us
in
the
morning
i
find
out
who
owns
half
an
hour
later
feeding
the
horses
he
called
saxon
attention
to
a
locomotive
whistle
you
got
your
railroad
he
said
that
a
train
pulling
into
glen
ellen
an
it
only
a
mile
from
saxon
was
dozing
off
to
sleep
under
the
blankets
when
billy
aroused
her
suppose
the
guy
that
owns
it
wo
sell
there
is
the
slightest
doubt
saxon
answered
with
unruffled
certainty
this
is
our
place
i
know
chapter
xviii
they
were
awakened
by
possum
who
was
indignantly
reproaching
a
tree
squirrel
for
not
coming
down
to
be
killed
the
squirrel
chattered
garrulous
remarks
that
drove
possum
into
a
mad
attempt
to
climb
the
tree
billy
and
saxon
giggled
and
hugged
each
other
at
the
frenzy
if
this
is
goin
to
be
our
place
they
be
no
shootin
of
tree
squirrels
billy
said
saxon
pressed
his
hand
and
sat
up
from
beneath
the
bench
came
the
cry
of
a
meadow
lark
there
is
anything
left
to
be
desired
she
sighed
happily
except
the
deed
billy
corrected
after
a
hasty
breakfast
they
started
to
explore
running
the
irregular
boundaries
of
the
place
and
repeatedly
crossing
it
from
rail
fence
to
creek
and
back
again
seven
springs
they
found
along
the
foot
of
the
bench
on
the
edge
of
the
meadow
there
your
water
supply
billy
said
drain
the
meadow
work
the
soil
up
and
with
fertilizer
and
all
that
water
you
can
grow
crops
the
year
round
there
must
be
five
acres
of
it
an
i
would
trade
it
for
they
were
standing
in
the
old
orchard
on
the
bench
where
they
had
counted
trees
neglected
but
of
generous
girth
and
on
top
the
bench
back
of
the
house
we
can
grow
saxon
paused
considering
a
new
thought
if
only
mortimer
would
come
up
and
advise
us
do
you
think
she
would
billy
sure
she
would
it
ai
more
four
hours
run
from
san
jose
but
first
we
get
our
hooks
into
the
place
then
you
can
write
to
sonoma
creek
gave
the
long
boundary
to
the
little
farm
two
sides
were
worm
fenced
and
the
fourth
side
was
wild
water
why
we
have
that
beautiful
man
and
woman
for
neighbors
saxon
recollected
wild
water
will
be
the
dividing
line
between
their
place
and
it
ai
ours
yet
billy
commented
let
go
and
call
on
be
able
to
tell
us
all
about
it
just
as
good
as
she
replied
the
big
thing
has
been
the
finding
and
whoever
owns
it
does
care
much
for
it
it
has
been
lived
in
for
a
long
time
and
oh
billy
are
you
satisfied
with
every
bit
of
it
he
answered
frankly
as
far
as
it
goes
but
the
trouble
is
it
do
go
far
the
disappointment
in
her
face
spurred
him
to
renunciation
of
his
particular
dream
we
buy
it
that
settled
he
said
but
outside
the
meadow
so
much
woods
that
they
little
pasture
not
more
enough
for
a
couple
of
horses
an
a
cow
but
i
do
care
we
ca
have
everything
an
what
they
is
is
almighty
let
us
call
it
a
starter
she
consoled
later
on
we
can
add
to
it
maybe
the
land
alongside
that
runs
up
the
wild
water
to
the
three
knolls
we
saw
where
i
seen
my
horses
pasturin
he
remembered
with
a
flash
of
eye
why
not
so
much
has
come
true
since
we
hit
the
road
maybe
come
true
too
we
work
for
it
we
work
like
hell
for
it
he
said
grimly
they
passed
through
the
rustic
gate
and
along
a
path
that
wound
through
wild
woods
there
was
no
sign
of
the
house
until
they
came
abruptly
upon
it
bowered
among
the
trees
it
was
and
so
justly
proportioned
that
its
two
stories
made
no
show
of
height
the
house
belonged
there
it
might
have
sprung
from
the
soil
just
as
the
trees
had
there
were
no
formal
grounds
the
wild
grew
to
the
doors
the
low
porch
of
the
main
entrance
was
raised
only
a
step
from
the
ground
trillium
covert
they
read
in
quaint
carved
letters
under
the
eave
of
the
porch
come
right
upstairs
you
dears
a
voice
called
from
above
in
response
to
saxon
knock
stepping
back
and
looking
up
she
beheld
the
little
lady
smiling
down
from
a
clad
in
a
and
flowing
house
gown
she
again
reminded
saxon
of
a
flower
just
push
the
front
door
open
and
find
your
way
was
the
direction
saxon
led
with
billy
at
her
heels
they
came
into
a
room
bright
with
windows
where
a
big
log
smoldered
in
a
fireplace
on
the
stone
slab
above
stood
a
huge
mexican
jar
filled
with
autumn
branches
and
trailing
fluffy
the
walls
were
finished
in
warm
natural
woods
stained
but
without
polish
the
air
was
aromatic
with
clean
wood
odors
a
walnut
organ
loomed
in
a
shallow
corner
of
the
room
all
corners
were
shallow
in
this
octagonal
dwelling
in
another
corner
were
many
rows
of
books
through
the
windows
across
a
low
couch
indubitably
made
for
use
could
be
seen
a
restful
picture
of
autumn
trees
and
yellow
grasses
threaded
by
wellworn
paths
that
ran
here
and
there
over
the
tiny
estate
a
delightful
little
stairway
wound
past
more
windows
to
the
upper
story
here
the
little
lady
greeted
them
and
led
them
into
what
saxon
knew
at
once
was
her
room
the
two
octagonal
sides
of
the
house
which
showed
in
this
wide
room
were
given
wholly
to
windows
under
the
long
sill
to
the
floor
were
shelves
of
books
books
lay
here
and
there
in
the
disorder
of
use
on
work
table
couch
and
desk
on
a
sill
by
an
open
window
a
jar
of
autumn
leaves
breathed
the
charm
of
the
sweet
brown
wife
who
seated
herself
in
a
tiny
rattan
chair
enameled
a
cheery
red
such
as
children
delight
to
rock
in
a
queer
house
hale
laughed
girlishly
and
contentedly
but
we
love
it
edmund
made
it
with
his
own
hands
even
to
the
plumbing
though
he
did
have
a
terrible
time
with
that
before
he
how
about
that
hardwood
floor
downstairs
an
the
fireplace
billy
inquired
all
all
she
replied
proudly
and
half
the
furniture
that
cedar
desk
there
the
table
with
his
own
they
are
such
gentle
hands
saxon
was
moved
to
say
hale
looked
at
her
quickly
her
vivid
face
alive
with
a
grateful
light
they
are
gentle
the
gentlest
hands
i
have
ever
known
she
said
softly
and
you
are
a
dear
to
have
noticed
it
for
you
only
saw
them
yesterday
in
i
could
help
it
saxon
said
simply
her
gaze
slipped
past
hale
attracted
by
the
wall
beyond
which
was
done
in
a
bewitching
honeycomb
pattern
dotted
with
golden
bees
the
walls
were
hung
with
a
few
a
very
few
framed
pictures
they
are
all
of
people
saxon
said
remembering
the
beautiful
paintings
in
mark
hall
bungalow
my
windows
frame
my
landscape
paintings
hale
answered
pointing
out
of
doors
inside
i
want
only
the
faces
of
my
dear
ones
whom
i
can
not
have
with
me
always
some
of
them
are
dreadful
oh
saxon
was
on
her
feet
and
looking
at
a
photograph
you
know
clara
hastings
i
ought
to
i
did
everything
but
nurse
her
at
my
breast
she
came
to
me
when
she
was
a
little
baby
her
mother
was
my
sister
do
you
know
how
greatly
you
resemble
her
i
remarked
it
to
edmund
yesterday
he
had
already
seen
it
it
was
a
bit
strange
that
his
heart
leaped
out
to
you
two
as
you
came
drilling
down
behind
those
beautiful
so
hale
was
clara
aunt
old
stock
that
had
crossed
the
plains
saxon
knew
now
why
she
had
reminded
her
so
strongly
of
her
own
mother
the
talk
whipped
quite
away
from
billy
who
could
only
admire
the
detailed
work
of
the
cedar
desk
while
he
listened
saxon
told
of
meeting
clara
and
jack
hastings
on
their
yacht
and
on
their
driving
trip
in
oregon
they
were
off
again
hale
said
having
shipped
their
horses
home
from
vancouver
and
taken
the
canadian
pacific
on
their
way
to
england
hale
knew
saxon
mother
or
rather
her
poems
and
produced
not
only
the
story
of
the
files
but
a
ponderous
scrapbook
which
contained
many
of
her
mother
poems
which
saxon
had
never
seen
a
sweet
singer
hale
said
but
so
many
had
sung
in
the
days
of
gold
and
been
forgotten
there
had
been
no
army
of
magazines
then
and
the
poems
had
perished
in
local
newspapers
jack
hastings
had
fallen
in
love
with
clara
the
talk
ran
on
then
visiting
at
trillium
covert
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
sonoma
valley
and
bought
a
magnificent
home
ranch
though
little
enough
he
saw
of
it
being
away
over
the
world
so
much
of
the
time
hale
talked
of
her
own
journey
across
the
plains
a
little
girl
in
the
late
fifties
and
like
mortimer
knew
all
about
the
fight
at
little
meadow
and
the
tale
of
the
massacre
of
the
emigrant
train
of
which
billy
father
had
been
the
sole
survivor
and
so
saxon
concluded
an
hour
later
we
been
three
years
searching
for
our
valley
of
the
moon
and
now
we
found
valley
of
the
moon
hale
queried
then
you
knew
about
it
all
the
time
what
kept
you
so
long
no
we
did
know
we
just
started
on
a
blind
search
for
it
mark
hall
called
it
a
pilgrimage
and
was
always
teasing
us
to
carry
long
staffs
he
said
when
we
found
the
spot
we
know
because
then
the
staffs
would
burst
into
blossom
he
laughed
at
all
the
good
things
we
wanted
in
our
valley
and
one
night
he
took
me
out
and
showed
me
the
moon
through
a
telescope
he
said
that
was
the
only
place
we
could
find
such
a
wonderful
valley
he
meant
it
was
moonshine
but
we
adopted
the
name
and
went
on
looking
for
what
a
coincidence
hale
exclaimed
for
this
is
the
valley
of
the
i
know
it
saxon
said
with
quiet
confidence
it
has
everything
we
but
you
do
understand
my
dear
this
is
the
valley
of
the
moon
this
is
sonoma
valley
sonoma
is
an
indian
word
and
means
the
valley
of
the
moon
that
was
what
the
indians
called
it
for
untold
ages
before
the
first
white
men
came
we
who
love
it
still
so
call
and
then
saxon
recalled
the
mysterious
references
jack
hastings
and
his
wife
had
made
to
it
and
the
talk
tripped
along
until
billy
grew
restless
he
cleared
his
throat
significantly
and
interrupted
we
want
to
find
out
about
that
ranch
acrost
the
creek
who
owns
it
if
they
sell
where
we
find
an
such
hale
stood
up
we
go
and
see
edmund
she
said
catching
saxon
by
the
hand
and
leading
the
way
my
billy
ejaculated
towering
above
her
i
used
to
think
saxon
was
small
but
she
make
two
of
and
you
pretty
big
the
little
woman
smiled
but
edmund
is
taller
than
you
and
they
crossed
a
bright
hall
and
found
the
big
beautiful
husband
lying
back
reading
in
a
huge
mission
rocker
beside
it
was
another
tiny
child
chair
of
rattan
along
the
length
of
his
thigh
the
head
on
his
knee
and
directed
toward
a
smoldering
log
in
a
fireplace
clung
an
incredibly
large
striped
cat
like
its
master
it
turned
its
head
to
greet
the
newcomers
again
saxon
felt
the
loving
benediction
that
abided
in
his
face
his
eyes
his
hands
toward
which
she
involuntarily
dropped
her
eyes
again
she
was
impressed
by
the
gentleness
of
them
they
were
hands
of
love
they
were
the
hands
of
a
type
of
man
she
had
never
dreamed
existed
no
one
in
that
merry
crowd
of
carmel
had
prefigured
him
they
were
artists
this
was
the
scholar
the
philosopher
in
place
of
the
passion
of
youth
and
all
youth
mad
revolt
was
the
benignance
of
wisdom
those
gentle
hands
had
passed
all
the
bitter
by
and
plucked
only
the
sweet
of
life
dearly
as
she
loved
them
she
shuddered
to
think
what
some
of
those
carmelites
would
be
like
when
they
were
as
old
as
he
especially
the
dramatic
critic
and
the
iron
man
here
are
the
dear
children
edmund
hale
said
what
do
you
think
they
want
to
buy
the
madrono
ranch
they
been
three
years
searching
for
it
i
forgot
to
tell
them
we
had
searched
ten
years
for
trillium
covert
tell
them
all
about
it
surely
naismith
is
still
of
a
mind
to
sell
they
seated
themselves
in
simple
massive
chairs
and
hale
took
the
tiny
rattan
beside
the
big
mission
rocker
her
slender
hand
curled
like
a
tendril
in
edmund
and
while
saxon
listened
to
the
talk
her
eyes
took
in
the
grave
rooms
lined
with
books
she
began
to
realize
how
a
mere
structure
of
wood
and
stone
may
express
the
spirit
of
him
who
conceives
and
makes
it
those
gentle
hands
had
made
all
this
the
very
furniture
she
guessed
as
her
eyes
roved
from
desk
to
chair
from
work
table
to
reading
stand
beside
the
bed
in
the
other
room
where
stood
a
lamp
and
orderly
piles
of
magazines
and
books
as
for
the
matter
of
madrono
ranch
it
was
easy
enough
he
was
saying
naismith
would
sell
had
desired
to
sell
for
the
past
five
years
ever
since
he
had
engaged
in
the
enterprise
of
bottling
mineral
water
at
the
springs
lower
down
the
valley
it
was
fortunate
that
he
was
the
owner
for
about
all
the
rest
of
the
surrounding
land
was
owned
by
a
frenchman
an
early
settler
he
would
not
part
with
a
foot
of
it
he
was
a
peasant
with
all
the
peasant
love
of
the
soil
which
in
him
had
become
an
obsession
a
disease
he
was
a
with
no
business
capacity
old
and
opinionated
he
was
land
poor
and
it
was
an
open
question
which
would
arrive
first
his
death
or
bankruptcy
as
for
madrono
ranch
naismith
owned
it
and
had
set
the
price
at
fifty
dollars
an
acre
that
would
be
one
thousand
dollars
for
there
were
twenty
acres
as
a
farming
investment
using
methods
it
was
not
worth
it
as
a
business
investment
yes
for
the
virtues
of
the
valley
were
on
the
eve
of
being
discovered
by
the
outside
world
and
no
better
location
for
a
summer
home
could
be
found
as
a
happiness
investment
in
joy
of
beauty
and
climate
it
was
worth
a
thousand
times
the
price
asked
and
he
knew
naismith
would
allow
time
on
most
of
the
amount
edmund
suggestion
was
that
they
take
a
two
years
lease
with
option
to
buy
the
rent
to
apply
to
the
purchase
if
they
took
it
up
naismith
had
done
that
once
with
a
swiss
who
had
paid
a
monthly
rental
of
ten
dollars
but
the
man
wife
had
died
and
he
had
gone
away
edmund
soon
divined
billy
renunciation
though
not
the
nature
of
it
and
several
questions
brought
it
forth
the
old
pioneer
dream
of
land
spaciousness
of
cattle
on
a
hundred
hills
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
of
land
the
smallest
thinkable
division
but
you
do
need
all
that
land
dear
lad
edmund
said
softly
i
see
you
understand
intensive
farming
have
you
thought
about
intensive
billy
jaw
dropped
at
the
smashing
newness
of
the
idea
he
considered
it
but
could
see
no
similarity
in
the
two
processes
unbelief
leaped
into
his
eyes
you
got
ta
show
me
he
cried
the
elder
man
smiled
gently
let
us
see
in
the
first
place
you
do
need
those
twenty
acres
except
for
beauty
there
are
five
acres
in
the
meadow
you
do
need
more
than
two
of
them
to
make
your
living
at
selling
vegetables
in
fact
you
and
your
wife
working
from
daylight
to
dark
can
not
properly
farm
those
two
acres
remains
three
acres
you
have
plenty
of
water
for
it
from
the
springs
do
be
satisfied
with
one
crop
a
year
like
the
rest
of
the
farmers
in
this
valley
farm
it
like
your
vegetable
plot
intensively
all
the
year
in
crops
that
make
irrigating
fertilizing
rotating
your
crops
those
three
acres
will
feed
as
many
horses
as
heaven
knows
how
huge
an
area
of
unseeded
uncared
for
wasted
pasture
would
feed
think
it
over
lend
you
books
on
the
subject
i
do
know
how
large
your
crops
will
be
nor
do
i
know
how
much
a
horse
eats
that
your
business
but
i
am
certain
with
a
hired
man
to
take
your
place
helping
your
wife
on
her
two
acres
of
vegetables
that
by
the
time
you
own
the
horses
your
three
acres
will
feed
you
will
have
all
you
can
attend
to
then
it
will
be
time
to
get
more
land
for
more
horses
for
more
riches
if
that
way
happiness
billy
understood
in
his
enthusiasm
he
dashed
out
you
some
edmund
smiled
and
glanced
toward
his
wife
give
him
your
opinion
of
that
her
blue
eyes
twinkled
as
she
complied
why
the
dear
he
never
farms
he
has
never
farmed
but
he
she
waved
her
hand
about
the
booklined
walls
he
is
a
student
of
good
he
studies
all
good
things
done
by
good
men
under
the
sun
his
pleasure
is
in
books
and
do
forget
dulcie
edmund
gently
protested
yes
and
annette
laughed
dulcie
is
our
cow
it
is
a
great
question
with
jack
hastings
whether
edmund
dotes
more
on
dulcie
or
dulcie
dotes
more
on
edmund
when
he
goes
to
san
francisco
dulcie
is
miserable
so
is
edmund
until
he
hastens
back
oh
dulcie
has
given
me
no
few
jealous
pangs
but
i
have
to
confess
he
understands
her
as
no
one
else
that
is
the
one
practical
subject
i
know
by
experience
edmund
confirmed
i
am
an
authority
on
jersey
cows
call
upon
me
any
time
for
he
stood
up
and
went
toward
his
and
they
saw
how
magnificently
large
a
man
he
was
he
paused
a
book
in
his
hand
to
answer
a
question
from
saxon
no
there
were
no
mosquitoes
although
one
summer
when
the
south
wind
blew
for
ten
days
an
unprecedented
thing
a
few
mosquitoes
had
been
carried
up
from
san
pablo
bay
as
for
fog
it
was
the
making
of
the
valley
and
where
they
were
situated
sheltered
behind
sonoma
mountain
the
fogs
were
almost
invariably
high
fogs
sweeping
in
from
the
ocean
forty
miles
away
they
were
deflected
by
sonoma
mountain
and
shunted
high
into
the
air
another
thing
trillium
covert
and
madrono
ranch
were
happily
situated
in
a
narrow
thermal
belt
so
that
in
the
frosty
mornings
of
winter
the
temperature
was
always
several
degrees
higher
than
in
the
rest
of
the
valley
in
fact
frost
was
very
rare
in
the
thermal
belt
as
was
proved
by
the
successful
cultivation
of
certain
orange
and
lemon
trees
edmund
continued
reading
titles
and
selecting
books
until
he
had
drawn
out
quite
a
number
he
opened
the
top
one
bolton
hall
three
acres
and
liberty
and
read
to
them
of
a
man
who
walked
six
hundred
and
fifty
miles
a
year
in
cultivating
by
methods
twenty
acres
from
which
he
harvested
three
thousand
bushels
of
poor
potatoes
and
of
another
man
a
new
farmer
who
cultivated
only
five
acres
walked
two
hundred
miles
and
produced
three
thousand
bushels
of
potatoes
early
and
choice
which
he
sold
at
many
times
the
price
received
by
the
first
man
saxon
received
the
books
from
edmund
and
as
she
heaped
them
in
arms
read
the
titles
they
were
wickson
california
fruits
wickson
california
vegetables
brooks
fertilizers

irrigation
and
drainage
kropotkin
fields
factories

of
volumes
on
farming
and
all
the
agricultural
bulletins
and
you
must
come
and
get
acquainted
with
dulcie
your
first
spare
time
he
called
after
them
out
the
door
chapter
xix
mortimer
arrived
with
seed
catalogs
and
farm
books
to
find
saxon
immersed
in
the
farm
books
borrowed
from
edmund
saxon
showed
her
around
and
she
was
delighted
with
everything
including
the
terms
of
the
lease
and
its
option
to
buy
and
now
she
said
what
is
to
be
done
sit
down
both
of
you
this
is
a
council
of
war
and
i
am
the
one

great
city

be
able
to
start
you
young
people
on
in
short
order
now

paused
for
breath
of
consideration
first

your
own
market
do
you

miles
from

to
take
saxon
and
me

which
you
have
the
address

look
for
the
address
this
afternoon
then
we
know
where
we
are
the
last
syllable
a
smiling
concession
to
billy
but
saxon
did
not
accompany
them
there
was
too
much
to
be
done
in
cleaning
the
house
and
in
preparing
an
arrangement
for
mortimer
to
sleep
and
it
was
long
after
supper
time
when
mortimer
and
billy
returned
you
lucky
lucky
children
she
began
immediately
this
valley
is
just
waking
up
here
your
market

a
competitor
in
the
valley
i
thought
those
resorts
looked
new
caliente
boyes
hot

all
along
the
line

there

three
little
hotels

i
talked
with
all
the
owners
and
she
a
wooz
billy
admired
she
brace
up
to
god
on
a
business
proposition
you
oughta
seen
mortimer
acknowledged
the
compliment
and
dashed
on
and
where
do
all
the
vegetables
come
from
wagons
drive
down
twelve
to
fifteen
miles
from
santa
rosa
and
up
from
sonoma
those
are
the
nearest
truck
farms
and
when
they
fail
as
they
often
do
i
am
told
to
supply
the
increasing
needs
the
managers
have
to
express
vegetables
all
the
way
from
san
francisco
i
introduced
billy
they
agreed
to
patronize
home
industry
besides
it
is
better
for
them
you
deliver
just
as
good
vegetables
just
as
cheap
you
will
make
it
a
point
to
deliver
better
fresher
vegetables
and
do
forget
that
delivery
for
you
will
be
cheaper
by
virtue
of
the
shorter
haul
no
egg
stunt
here
no
jams
nor
jellies
but
you
got
lots
of
space
up
on
the
bench
here
on
which
you
ca
grow
vegetables
morning
i
help
you
lay
out
the
chicken
runs
and
houses
besides
there
is
the
matter
of
capons
for
the
san
francisco
market
you
start
small
it
will
be
a
side
line
at
first
i
tell
you
all
about
that
too
and
send
you
the
literature
you
must
use
your
head
let
others
do
the
work
you
must
understand
that
thoroughly
the
wages
of
superintendence
are
always
larger
than
the
wages
of
the
laborers
you
must
keep
books
you
must
know
where
you
stand
you
must
know
what
pays
and
what
does
and
what
pays
best
your
books
will
tell
that
show
you
all
in
good
an
think
of
it
all
that
on
two
acres
billy
murmured
mortimer
looked
at
him
sharply
two
acres
your
granny
she
said
with
asperity
five
acres
and
then
you
wo
be
able
to
supply
your
market
and
you
my
boy
as
soon
as
the
first
rains
come
will
have
your
hands
full
and
your
horses
weary
draining
that
meadow
we
work
those
plans
out
also
there
is
the
matter
of
berries
on
the
bench
here
and
trellised
table
grapes
the
choicest
they
bring
the
fancy
prices
there
will
be
blackberries
burbank
he
lives
at
santa
rosa
loganberries
mammoth
berries
but
do
fool
with
strawberries
that
a
whole
occupation
in
itself
they
not
vines
you
know
i
examined
the
orchard
it
a
good
foundation
we
settle
the
pruning
and
grafts
but
billy
wanted
three
acres
of
the
meadow
saxon
explained
at
the
first
chance
what
for
to
grow
hay
and
other
kinds
of
food
for
the
horses
he
going
to
buy
it
out
of
a
portion
of
the
profits
from
those
three
acres
mortimer
decided
on
the
instant
billy
swallowed
and
again
achieved
renunciation
all
right
he
said
with
a
brave
show
of
cheerfulness
let
her
go
us
for
the
during
the
several
days
of
mortimer
visit
billy
let
the
two
women
settle
things
for
themselves
oakland
had
entered
upon
a
boom
and
from
the
west
oakland
stables
had
come
an
urgent
letter
for
more
horses
so
billy
was
out
early
and
late
scouring
the
surrounding
country
for
young
work
animals
in
this
way
at
the
start
he
learned
his
valley
thoroughly
there
was
also
a
clearing
out
at
the
west
oakland
stables
of
mares
whose
feet
had
been
knocked
out
on
the
hard
city
pavements
and
he
was
offered
first
choice
at
bargain
prices
they
were
good
animals
he
knew
what
they
were
because
he
knew
them
of
old
time
the
soft
earth
of
the
country
with
a
preliminary
rest
in
pasture
with
their
shoes
pulled
off
would
put
them
in
shape
they
would
never
do
again
on
streets
but
there
were
years
of
farm
work
in
them
and
then
there
was
the
breeding
but
he
could
not
undertake
to
buy
them
he
fought
out
the
battle
in
secret
and
said
nothing
to
saxon
at
night
he
would
sit
in
the
kitchen
and
smoke
listening
to
all
that
the
two
women
had
done
and
planned
in
the
day
the
right
kind
of
horses
was
hard
to
buy
and
as
he
put
it
it
was
like
pulling
a
tooth
to
get
a
farmer
to
part
with
one
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
been
authorized
to
increase
the
buying
sum
by
as
much
as
fifty
dollars
despite
the
coming
of
the
automobile
the
price
of
heavy
draught
animals
continued
to
rise
from
as
early
as
billy
could
remember
the
price
of
the
big
work
horses
had
increased
steadily
after
the
great
earthquake
the
price
had
jumped
yet
it
had
never
gone
back
billy
you
make
more
money
as
a
than
a
common
laborer
do
you
mortimer
asked
very
well
then
you
wo
have
to
drain
the
meadow
or
plow
it
or
anything
you
keep
right
on
buying
horses
work
with
your
head
but
out
of
what
you
make
you
will
please
pay
the
wages
of
one
laborer
for
saxon
vegetables
it
will
be
a
good
investment
with
quick
sure
he
agreed
that
all
anybody
hires
any
body
for
to
make
money
outa
but
how
saxon
an
one
man
are
goin
to
work
them
five
acres
when
hale
says
two
of
us
could
do
what
needed
on
two
acres
is
beyond
saxon
is
going
to
work
mortimer
retorted
did
you
see
me
working
at
san
jose
saxon
is
going
to
use
her
head
it
about
time
you
woke
up
to
that
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
is
what
is
earned
by
persons
who
do
use
their
heads
and
she
is
going
to
be
satisfied
with
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
now
listen
i
had
a
long
talk
with
hale
this
afternoon
he
says
there
are
practically
no
efficient
laborers
to
be
hired
in
the
i
know
that
billy
interjected
all
the
good
men
go
to
the
cities
it
only
the
leavin
that
left
the
good
ones
that
stay
behind
workin
for
which
is
perfectly
true
every
word
now
listen
children
i
knew
about
it
and
i
spoke
to
hale
he
is
prepared
to
make
the
arrangements
for
you
he
knows
all
about
it
himself
and
is
in
touch
with
the
warden
in
short
you
will
parole
two
prisoners
from
san
quentin
and
they
will
be
gardeners
there
are
plenty
of
chinese
and
italians
there
and
they
are
the
best
you
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
you
serve
the
poor
convicts
and
you
serve
saxon
hesitated
shocked
while
billy
gravely
considered
the
question
you
know
john
mortimer
went
on
mr
hale
man
about
the
place
how
do
you
like
him
oh
i
was
wishing
only
that
we
could
find
somebody
like
him
saxon
said
eagerly
he
such
a
dear
faithful
soul
hale
told
me
a
lot
of
fine
things
about
there
one
thing
she
did
tell
you
smiled
mortimer
john
is
a
paroled
convict
years
ago
in
hot
blood
he
killed
a
man
in
a
quarrel
over
cents
he
been
out
of
prison
with
the
hales
three
years
now
you
remember
louis
the
old
frenchman
on
my
place
he
another
so
that
settled
when
your
two
come
of
course
you
will
pay
them
fair
wages
and
we
make
sure
they
the
same
nationality
either
chinese
or
italians
well
when
they
come
john
with
their
help
and
under
hale
guidance
will
knock
together
a
small
cabin
for
them
to
live
in
we
select
the
spot
even
so
when
your
farm
is
in
full
swing
you
have
to
have
more
outside
help
so
keep
your
eyes
open
billy
while
you
gallivanting
over
the
the
next

billy

at
nine

eat
soon
as
i
come
the
two
women
were
regarding
each
other
with
shining
eyes
each
on
the
verge
of
speech
when
billy
returned
to
the
door
and
stuck
his
head
in
they
one
thing
maybe
you

he

i
pull

but
the
six
mares
is
mine
too
i
own
mine
are
you
on
chapter
xx
i
not
done
with
you
children
had
been
mortimer
parting
words
and
several
times
that
winter
she
ran
up
to
advise
and
to
teach
saxon
how
to
calculate
her
crops
for
the
small
immediate
market
for
the
increasing
spring
market
and
for
the
height
of
summer
at
which
time
she
would
be
able
to
sell
all
she
could
possibly
grow
and
then
not
supply
the
demand
in
the
meantime
hazel
and
hattie
were
used
every
odd
moment
in
hauling
manure
from
glen
ellen
whose
barnyards
had
never
known
such
a
thorough
cleaning
also
there
were
loads
of
commercial
fertilizer
from
the
railroad
station
bought
under
instructions
the
convicts
paroled
were
chinese
both
had
served
long
in
prison
and
were
old
men
but
the
day
work
they
were
habitually
capable
of
won
mortimer
approval
gow
yum
twenty
years
before
had
had
charge
of
the
vegetable
garden
of
one
of
the
great
menlo
park
estates
his
disaster
had
come
in
the
form
of
a
fight
over
a
game
of
fan
tan
in
the
chinese
quarter
at
redwood
city
his
companion
chan
chi
had
been
a
of
note
in
the
old
fighting
days
of
the
san
francisco
tongs
but
a
quarter
of
century
of
discipline
in
the
prison
vegetable
gardens
had
cooled
his
blood
and
turned
his
hand
from
hatchet
to
hoe
these
two
assistants
had
arrived
in
glen
ellen
like
precious
goods
in
bond
and
been
receipted
for
by
the
local
deputy
sheriff
who
in
addition
reported
on
them
to
the
prison
authorities
each
month
saxon
too
made
out
a
monthly
report
and
sent
it
in
as
for
the
danger
of
their
cutting
her
throat
she
quickly
got
over
the
idea
of
it
the
mailed
hand
of
the
state
hovered
over
them
the
taking
of
a
single
drink
of
liquor
would
provoke
that
hand
to
close
down
and
jerk
them
back
to
nor
had
they
freedom
of
movement
when
old
gow
yum
needed
to
go
to
san
francisco
to
sign
certain
papers
before
the
chinese
consul
permission
had
first
to
be
obtained
from
san
quentin
then
too
neither
man
was
nasty
tempered
saxon
had
been
apprehensive
of
the
task
of
bossing
two
desperate
convicts
but
when
they
came
she
found
it
a
pleasure
to
work
with
them
she
could
tell
them
what
to
do
but
it
was
they
who
knew
how
to
do
from
them
she
learned
all
the
ten
thousand
tricks
and
quirks
of
artful
gardening
and
she
was
not
long
in
realizing
how
helpless
she
would
have
been
had
she
depended
on
local
labor
still
further
she
had
no
fear
because
she
was
not
alone
she
had
been
using
her
head
it
was
quickly
apparent
to
her
that
she
could
not
adequately
oversee
the
outside
work
and
at
the
same
time
do
the
house
work
she
wrote
to
ukiah
to
the
energetic
widow
who
had
lived
in
the
adjoining
house
and
taken
in
washing
she
had
promptly
closed
with
saxon
offer
paul
was
forty
short
in
stature
and
weighed
two
hundred
pounds
but
never
wearied
on
her
feet
also
she
was
devoid
of
fear
and
according
to
billy
could
settle
the
hash
of
both
chinese
with
one
of
her
mighty
arms
paul
arrived
with
her
son
a
country
lad
of
sixteen
who
knew
horses
and
could
milk
hilda
the
pretty
jersey
which
had
successfully
passed
edmund
expert
eye
though
paul
ably
handled
the
house
there
was
one
thing
saxon
insisted
on
doing
namely
washing
her
own
pretty
flimsies
when
i
no
longer
able
to
do
that
she
told
billy
you
can
take
a
spade
to
that
clump
of
redwoods
beside
wild
water
and
dig
a
hole
it
will
be
time
to
bury
it
was
early
in
the
days
of
madrono
ranch
at
the
time
of
mortimer
second
visit
that
billy
drove
in
with
a
load
of
pipe
and
house
chicken
yards
and
barn
were
piped
from
the
tank
he
installed
below
the
huh
i
guess
i
can
use
my
head
he
said
i
watched
a
woman
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
packin
water
two
hundred
feet
from
the
spring
to
the
house
an
i
did
some
figurin
i
put
it
at
three
trips
a
day
and
on
wash
days
a
whole
lot
more
an
you
ca
guess
what
i
made
out
she
traveled
a
year
packin
water
one
hundred
an
miles
d
get
that
one
hundred
and
miles
i
asked
her
how
long
she
been
there
years
multiply
it
for
yourself
three
thousan
seven
hundred
an
miles
all
for
the
sake
of
two
hundred
feet
of
pipe
would
that
jar
you
oh
i
ai
done
yet
they
a
an
stationary
tubs
soon
as
i
can
see
my
way
an
say
saxon

that
little
clear
flat
just
where
wild
water
runs
into
sonoma
they

of
an
acre

chance
an
i
never
see
as
soon
as
you
start
deliverin
vegetables
i
guess
that
help
some
to
keep
another
horse
but
billy
was
destined
for
a
time
to
forget
his
alfalfa
in
the
excitement
of
bigger
ventures
first
came
trouble
the
several
hundred
dollars
he
had
arrived
with
in
sonoma
valley
and
all
his
own
commissions
since
earned
had
gone
into
improvements
and
living
the
eighteen
dollars
a
week
rental
for
his
six
horses
at
lawndale
went
to
pay
wages
and
he
was
unable
to
buy
the
needed
for
his
expeditions
this
however
he
had
got
around
by
again
using
his
head
and
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
he
began
breaking
colts
to
drive
and
in
the
driving
drove
them
wherever
he
sought
horses
so
far
all
was
well
but
a
new
administration
in
san
francisco
pledged
to
economy
had
stopped
all
street
work
this
meant
the
shutting
down
of
the
lawndale
quarry
which
was
one
of
the
sources
of
supply
for
paving
blocks
the
six
horses
would
not
only
be
back
on
his
hands
but
he
would
have
to
feed
them
how
paul
gow
yum
and
chan
chi
were
to
be
paid
was
beyond
him
i
guess
we
bit
off
we
could
chew
he
admitted
to
saxon
that
night
he
was
late
in
coming
home
but
brought
with
him
a
radiant
face
saxon
was
no
less
radiant
it
all
right
she
greeted
him
coming
out
to
the
barn
where
he
was
unhitching
a
tired
but
fractious
colt
i
talked
with
all
three
they
see
the
situation
and
are
perfectly
willing
to
let
their
wages
stand
a
while
by
another
week

start
hazel
and
hattie
delivering
vegetables
then
the
money
will
pour

lopsided
and
oh
billy
you
never
guess
old
gow
yum
has
a
bank
account

me

the
time
for
maybe
the

but
i
knew

when
they
asked
for

of
other

i
we
are
on
the
ground
an
i
might
as
well
show
you
an
i
did
i
showed
where
i
lose

stuck
to
their
plan
on

about
seventy
or
eighty
feet
of
elevated

say
saxon
that
kind
of
talk
got
it
was
straight
only
been
thinkin
about
bricks
while
i
was
only
thinkin
of
teamin
i
guess
they
was
all
of
half
an
hour
considerin
an
i
was
almost
as
miserable
waitin
as
when
i
waited
for
you

i
asked
you
i
went
over
the

to
you
see
i
given
it
to
stiff
regular
city
prices
an
i

raise
enough
hay

feed
for
its
own
animals
it

san
joaquin
valley
why

francisco
laid
down
than
i
can
here
an
haul
it
myself
an
that
struck
hard
it

true
an
they
knew
it
but
say
if
they
asked
about
wages
for
drivers
an
about

i
to

country
an
no
horseshoers
union
an
rent
is
low
an
them

office
an
he
takes
my
whole
bunch
an
throws
off
cents
on
each
shoein
though
it
on
the
but
they

think
to
ask
bein
too
full
of
billy
felt
in
his
breast
pocket
drew
out
a
document
and
handed
it
to
saxon
there
it
is
he
said

contract
full
of
all
the
agreements
prices
an
penalties
i
saw
hale
down

lawndale
and
while
i
waited
i
went
over
my
figures
again
you
could
guess
it
in
a
million
years
i
made
a
mistake
in
addition
somewhere
an
soaked
ten
per
cent
i
expected
talk
about
findin
money
any
time
you
want
them
couple
of
extra
men
to
help
out
with
the
vegetables
say
the

eight
per
cent
interest
an
that
we
wo
want

more
three
or
four
when
billy
got
away
from
saxon
arms
he
started
leading
the
colt
up
and
down
to
cool
it
off
he
stopped
so
abruptly
that
his
back
collided
with
the
colt
nose
and
there
was
a
lively
minute
of
rearing
and
plunging
saxon
waited
for
she
knew
a
fresh
idea
had
struck
billy
say
he
said
do
you
know
anything
about
bank
accounts
and
checks
chapter
xxi
it
was
on
a
bright
june
morning
that
billy
told
saxon
to
put
on
her
riding
clothes
to
try
out
a
not
until
after
ten
she
said
by
that
time
i
have
the
wagon
off
on
a
second
despite
the
extent
of
the
business
she
had
developed
her
executive
ability
and
system
gave
her
much
spare
time
she
could
call
on
the
hales
which
was
ever
a
delight
especially
now
that
the
hastings
were
back
and
that
clara
was
often
at
her
aunt
in
this
congenial
atmosphere
saxon
burgeoned
she
had
begun
to
read
to
read
with
understanding
and
she
had
time
for
her
books
for
work
on
her
pretties
and
for
billy
whom
she
accompanied
on
many
expeditions
billy
was
even
busier
than
she
his
work
being
more
scattered
and
diverse
and
as
well
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
home
barn
and
horses
which
saxon
used
in
truth
he
had
become
a
man
of
affairs
though
mortimer
had
gone
over
his
accounts
with
an
eagle
eye
on
the
expense
column
discovering
several
minor
leaks
and
finally
aided
by
saxon
bullied
him
into
keeping
books
each
night
after
supper
he
and
saxon
posted
their
books
afterward
in
the
big
morris
chair
he
had
insisted
on
buying
early
in
the
days
of
his
brickyard
contract
saxon
would
creep
into
his
arms
and
strum
on
the
ukulele
or
they
would
talk
long
about
what
they
were
doing
and
planning
to
do
now
it
would
be
i
mixin
up
in
politics
saxon
it
pays
you
bet
it
pays
if
by
next
spring
i
ai
got
a
half
a
dozen
teams
workin
on
the
roads
an
down
the
county
money
it
me
back
to
oakland
an
askin
the
boss
for
a
or
saxon
they
really
starting
that
new
hotel
between
caliente
and
eldridge
and
there
some
talk
of
a
big
sanitarium
back
in
the
or
it
would
be
billy
now
that
you
piped
that
acre
you
just
got
to
let
me
have
it
for
my
vegetables
i
rent
it
from
you
take
your
own
estimate
for
all
the
alfalfa
you
can
raise
on
it
and
pay
you
full
market
price
less
the
cost
of
growing
it
all
right
take
billy
suppressed
a
sigh
besides
i
too
busy
to
fool
with
it
which
prevarication
was
by
virtue
of
his
having
just
installed
the
ram
and
piped
the
land
it
will
be
the
wisest
billy
she
soothed
for
she
knew
his
dream
of
was
stronger
than
ever
you
do
want
to
fool
with
an
acre
there
that
hundred
and
forty
we
buy
it
yet
if
old
chavon
ever
dies
besides
it
really
belongs
to
madrono
ranch
the
two
together
were
the
original
quarter
i
do
wish
no
man
death
billy
grumbled
but
he
ai
no
good
out
of
it
it
with
a
lot
of
scrub
animals
sized
it
up
every
inch
of
it
they
at
least
forty
acres
in
the
three
cleared
fields
with
water
in
the
hills
behind
to
beat
the
band
the
horse
feed
i
could
raise
on
it
take
your
breath
away
then
they
at
least
fifty
acres
i
could
run
my
brood
mares
on
pasture
mixed
up
with
trees
and
steep
places
and
such
the
other
fifty
just
thick
woods

wild
game
an
that
old
adobe
barn
all
right
with

of
animals
in
bad
weather
look
at
me
now
rentin
that
measly
pasture

just
to

father
of

madronos
watching
hazel
and

go
out

the
full
vegetable
wagon
behind
them
when
she
saw
billy
ride
in
leading
a
sorrel
mare
from
whose
silken
coat
the
sun
flashed
golden
lights
a
handful
but
no
vicious
tricks
billy
chanted
as
he
stopped
beside

like

the
toughest
broncho

gasped
standing
with
hands
clasped
in
inarticulate
delight
that
what
i
brought
her
to
show
you
but
how
much
must
they
want
for
her
was
saxon
next
question
so
impossible
did
it
seem
that
such
an
amazement
of
could
ever
be
hers
that
ai
your
business
billy
answered
brusquely
the
payin
for
her
not

vegetable
ranch

the
word
what

billy
said
she
ai
that
the
saxon
tightly
gripped
reins
and
mane
stepped
with
spurred
foot
on
billy
hand
and
was
lifted
lightly
into
the
saddle
she
used
to
spurs
billy
called
after
spanish
broke
so
check
her
quick
come
in
gentle
an
talk
to
her
she
you
saxon
nodded
dashed
out
the
gate
and
down
the
road
waved
a
hand
to
clara
hastings
as
she
passed
the
gate
of
trillium
covert
and
continued
up
wild
water
canyon
when
she
came
back
ramona
in
a
pleasant
lather
saxon
rode
to
the
rear
of
the
house
past
the
chicken
houses
and
the
flourishing
to
join
billy
on
the
rim
of
the
bench
where
he
sat
on
his
horse
in
the
shade
smoking
a
cigarette
together
they
looked
down
through
an
opening
among
the
trees
to
the
meadow
which
was
a
meadow
no
longer
with
mathematical
accuracy
it
was
divided
into
squares
oblongs
and
narrow
strips
which
displayed
sharply
the
thousand
hues
of
green
of
a
truck
garden
gow
yum
and
chan
chi
under
enormous
chinese
grass
hats
were
planting
green
onions
old
hughie
hoe
in
hand
plodded
along
the
main
artery
of
running
water
opening
certain
laterals
closing
others
from
the
beyond
the
barn
the
strokes
of
a
hammer
told
saxon
that
carlsen
was
vegetable
boxes
paul
cheery
soprano
lifted
in
a
hymn
floated
through
the
trees
accompanied
by
the
whirr
of
an
a
sharp
barking
told
where
possum
still
waged
hysterical
and
baffled
war
on
the
douglass
squirrels
billy
took
a
long
draw
from
his
cigarette
exhaled
the
smoke
and
continued
to
look
down
at
the
meadow
saxon
divined
trouble
in
his
manner
his
was
on
the
pommel
and
her
free
hand
went
out
and
softly
rested
on
his
billy
turned
his
slow
gaze
upon
her
mare
lather
seeming
not
to
note
it
and
continued
on
to
saxon
face
huh
he
equivocated
as
if
waking
up
them
san
leandro
porchugeeze
ai
got
nothin
on
us
when
it
comes
to
intensive
farmin
look
at
that
water
runnin

it
seems
so
good
to
me
that
sometimes
i
just
wanta
get
down
on
hands
an
knees
an
lap
it
all
up
oh

this
saxon
exclaimed
an

if
the
rains

you
there
sonoma
creek
alongside
all

gasolene
but

billy
i

talking
with
thompson
he

he
said
abruptly
you

the
all
right
if
you
tell
me
what
bothering
he
looked
at
her
quickly
nothin
he
grunted
yes
there
is
too
what
the
difference

it
sooner
or
later
you
ought
to
see
old
chavon
his
face
is
that
long
he
ca

without
bumpin
his
knee
on
his
chin
his
peterin
gold
mine
his
clay
pit
it
the
same
thing
he
gettin
twenty
cents
a
yard
for
it
from

and
that
means
the
end
of
your
teaming
saxon
saw
the
disaster
in
all
its
hugeness
what
about
the
brickyard
people
worried
to
death
though
they
kept
secret
about
it
they
had
men
out
punchin
holes
all
over
the
hills
for
a
week
an
that
jap
chemist
settin
up
nights
analyzin
the
rubbish
they
brought
in
peculiar
stuff
that
clay
for
what
they
want
it
for
an
you
do
find
it
everywhere
them
experts
that
reported
on
chavon
pit
made
one
hell
of
a
mistake
maybe
they
was
lazy
with
their
borin
anyway
they
slipped
up
on
the
amount
of
clay
they
was
in
it
now
do
get
to
botherin
it
come
out
somehow
you
ca
do
but

saxon
insisted
we
wo

a
thing
to
do
with
that
he
answered
i
buyin

her
price
do
cut
any
figure
alongside
the
big
game
i
playin
of
course
i
can
always
sell
my
horses
but
that
puts
a
stop
to
their
makin
money
an
that
brickyard
contract
was
but
if
you
get
some
of
them
in
on
the
road

county
she
suggested
oh

that
in
mind
an
i
keepin
my
eyes
open
they
a
chance
the
quarry
will
start
again
an
the
fellow

most
of
the
horses
here

vegetable
business
that
solid
we
just
do
go
ahead
so
fast
for
a
time
that
all
i
ai
scared
of
the
country
any
more
i
sized
things
up
as
we
went
along
they
ai
a
jerk
burg
we
hit
all
the
time
on
the
road
that
i
could
jump
into
an
make
a
go
now
where
want
to
ride
chapter
xxii
they
cantered
out
the
gate
thundered
across
the
bridge
and
passed
trillium
covert
before
they
pulled
in
on
the
grade
of
wild
water
canyon
saxon
had
chosen
her
field
on
the
big
spur
of
sonoma
mountains
as
the
objective
of
their
ride
say
i
bumped
into
something
big
this
mornin
when
i
was
goin
to
fetch
ramona
billy
said
the
clay
pit
trouble
banished
for
the
time
you
know
the
hundred
an
forty
i
passed
young
chavon
along
the
road
an
i
do
know
why
just
for
ducks
i
guess
i
up
an
asked
if
he
thought
the
old
man
would
lease
the
hundred
an
forty
to
me
an
what
d
think
he
said
the
old
man
did
own
it
was
just
leasin
it
himself
that
how
we
was
always
seein
his
cattle
on
it
it
a
gouge
into
his
land
for
he
owns
everything
on
three
sides
of
it
next
i
met
ping
he
said
hilyard
owned
it
an
was
willin
to
sell
only
chavon
did
have
the
price
then
comin
back
i
looked
in
on
payne
he
quit
blacksmithin
his
back
hurtin
from
a
kick
an
just
startin
in
for
real
estate
sure
he
said
hilyard
would
sell
an
had
already
listed
the
land
with
chavon
it
an
hilyard
wo
give
another
when
they
had
climbed
out
of
wild
water
canyon
they
turned
their
horses
about
and
halted
on
the
rim
where
they
could
look
across
at
the
three
densely
wooded
knolls
in
the
midst
of
the
desired
hundred
and
forty
we
get
it
yet
saxon
said
sure
we
will
billy
agreed
with
careless
certitude
i
ben
over
the
big
adobe
barn
again
just
the
thing
for
a
raft
of
horses
a
new
roof
be
cheaper
i
thought
though
neither
chavon
or
me
be
in
the
market
to
buy
it
right
away
with
the
clay
pinchin
when
they
reached
saxon
field
which
they
had
learned
was
the
property
of
redwood
thompson
they
tied
the
horses
and
entered
it
on
foot
the
hay
just
cut
was
being
raked
by
thompson
who
hallo
a
greeting
to
them
it
was
a
cloudless
windless
day
and
they
sought
refuge
from
the
sun
in
the
woods
beyond
they
encountered
a
dim
trail
it
a
cow
trail
billy
declared
i
bet
they
a
teeny
pasture
tucked
away
somewhere
in
them
trees
let
follow
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
several
hundred
feet
up
the
side
of
the
spur
they
emerged
on
an
open
grassy
space
of
bare
hillside
most
of
the
hundred
and
forty
two
miles
away
lay
beneath
them
while
they
were
level
with
the
tops
of
the
three
knolls
billy
paused
to
gaze
upon
the
land
and
saxon
joined
him
what
is
that
she
asked
pointing
toward
the
knolls
up
the
little
canyon
to
the
left
of
it
there
on
the
farthest
knoll
right
under
that
spruce
that
leaning
what
billy
saw
was
a
white
scar
on
the
canyon
wall
it
one
on
me
he
said
studying
the
scar
i
thought
i
knew
every
inch
of
that
land
but
i
never
seen
that
before
why
i
was
right
in
there
at
the
head
of
the
canyon
the
first
part
of
the
winter
it
awful
wild
walls
of
the
canyon
like
the
sides
of
a
steeple
an
covered
with
thick
what
is
it
she
asked
a
slide
must
be
brought
down
by
the
heavy
rains
if
i
do
miss
my
guess
billy
broke
off
forgetting
in
the
intensity
with
which
he
continued
to
look
hilyard
sell
for
thirty
an
acre
he
began
again
disconnectedly
good
land
bad
land
an
all
just
as
it
runs
thirty
an
acre
hundred
payne
new
at
real
estate
an
i

his
commission

easiest

gow
yum
an

money

my
horses

are
you
going
to
buy
it
saxon
teased
she
scarcely
touched
the
edge
of
his
thought
he
looked
at
her
as
if
he
had
heard
then
forgot
her
the
next
moment
head
work
he
mumbled
head
work
if
i
do
put
over
a
hot
one
he
started
back
down
the
cow
trail
recollected
saxon
and
called
over
his
shoulder
come
on
let
hustle
i
wanta
ride
over
an
look
at
so
rapidly
did
he
go
down
the
trail
and
across
the
field
that
saxon
had
no
time
for
questions
she
was
almost
breathless
from
her
effort
to
keep
up
with
him
what
is
it
she
begged
as
he
lifted
her
to
the
saddle
maybe
it
all
a
joke
i
tell
you
about
it
afterward
he
put
her
off
they
galloped
on
the
levels
trotted
down
the
gentler
slopes
of
road
and
not
until
on
the
steep
descent
of
wild
water
canyon
did
they
rein
to
a
walk
billy
preoccupation
was
gone
and
saxon
took
advantage
to
broach
a
subject
which
had
been
on
her
mind
for
some
time
clara
hastings
told
me
the
other
day
that
they
going
to
have
a
house
party
the
hazards
are
to
be
there
and
the
halls
and
roy
blanchard
she
looked
at
billy
anxiously
at
the
mention
of
blanchard
his
head
had
tossed
up
as
to
a
bugle
call
slowly
a
whimsical
twinkle
began
to
glint
up
through
the
cloudy
blue
of
his
eyes
it
a
long
time
since
you
told
any
man
he
was
standing
on
his
foot
she
ventured
slyly
billy
began
to
grin
sheepishly
aw
that
all
right
he
said
in
fashion
roy
blanchard
can
come
i
let
all
that
was
a
long
time
ago
besides
i
too
busy
to
fool
with
such
he
urged
his
horse
on
at
a
faster
walk
and
as
soon
as
the
slope
lessened
broke
into
a
trot
at
trillium
covert
they
were
galloping
you
have
to
stop
for
dinner
first
saxon
said
as
they
neared
the
gate
of
madrono
ranch
you
stop
he
answered
i
do
want
no
but
i
want
to
go
with
you
she
pleaded
what
is
it
i
do
dast
tell
you
you
go
on
in
an
get
your
not
after
that
she
said
nothing
can
keep
me
from
coming
along
half
a
mile
farther
on
they
left
the
highway
passed
through
a
patent
gate
which
billy
had
installed
and
crossed
the
fields
on
a
road
which
was
coated
thick
with
chalky
dust
this
was
the
road
that
led
to
chavon
clay
pit
the
hundred
and
forty
lay
to
the
west
two
wagons
in
a
cloud
of
dust
came
into
sight
your
teams
billy
cried
saxon
think
of
it
just
by
the
use
of
the
head
earning
your
money
while
you
riding
around
with
makes
me
ashamed
to
think
how
much
cash
money
each
one
of
them
teams
is
bringin
me
in
every
day
he
acknowledged
they
were
turning
off
from
the
road
toward
the
bars
which
gave
entrance
to
the
one
hundred
and
forty
when
the
driver
of
the
foremost
wagon
hallo
and
waved
his
hand
they
drew
in
their
horses
and
waited
the
big
roan
broke
loose
the
driver
said
as
he
stopped
beside
them
clean
crazy

bitin
squealin
strikin

acknowledged

hit

be
in
the
cities
like
all
the
rest
of
the
better
men

horse
through
then

the
bars
when

that
count

big
when

sighed
contentedly
i
never
used
to
think
about
such
things
but
when
we
shook
oakland
i
began
to
wise
up
it
was
them
san
leandro
porchugeeze
that
gave
me
my
first
i
been
asleep
before
they
skirted
the
lower
of
the
three
fields
where
the
ripe
hay
stood
uncut
billy
pointed
with
eloquent
disgust
to
a
break
in
the
fence
slovenly
repaired
and
on
to
the
standing
grain
by
cattle
them
the
things
he
criticized
old
style
an
look
how
thin
that
crop
is
an
the
shallow
plowin
scrub
cattle

farmin
chavon

years
now
an
never
rested
it
once
never
put
anything
in
for
what
he
took
out
except
the
cattle
into
the
stubble
the
minute
the
hay
was
in
a
pasture
glade
farther
on
they
came
upon
a
bunch
of
cattle
look
at
that
bull
saxon
scrub
no
name
for
it
they
oughta
be
a
state
law
against
lettin
such
animals

no
wonder
chavon
that
land
poor
he
had
to
sink
all
his
earnin
into
taxes
interest
he
ca
make
his
land
pay

this
hundred
an
forty
anybody

the
savve
can
just
rake
silver
dollars
offen
it
i
show
they
passed
the
big
adobe
barn
in
the
distance
a
few
dollars
at
the
right
time
would
hundreds
on
that
roof
billy
commented
well
anyway
i
wo
be
payin
for
any
improvements
when
i
buy
an
i
tell
you
another
thing
this
ranch
is
full
of
water
and
if
glen
ellen
ever
grows
they
have
to
come
to
see
me
for
their
water
billy
knew
the
ranch
thoroughly
and
took
through
the
woods
by
way
of
cattle
paths
once
he
reined
in
abruptly
and
both
stopped
confronting
them
a
dozen
paces
away
was
a
red
fox
for
half
a
minute
with
beady
eyes
the
wild
thing
studied
them
with
twitching
sensitive
nose
reading
the
messages
of
the
air
then
it
leapt
aside
and
was
gone
among
the
trees
the
billy
ejaculated
as
they
approached
wild
water
they
rode
out
into
a
long
narrow
meadow
in
the
middle
was
a
pond
natural
reservoir
when
glen
ellen
begins
to
buy
water
billy
said
see
down
at
the
lower
end
there
would
cost
anything
hardly
to
throw
a
dam
across
an
i
can
pipe
in
all
kinds
of
water
goin
to
be
money
in
this
valley
not
a
thousan
years
from
an
all
the
ginks
an
boobs
an
dubs
an
gazabos
poundin
their
ear
deado
an
not
seein
it
an
surveyors
workin
up
the
valley
for
an
electric
road
from
sausalito
with
a
branch
up
napa
they
came
to
the
rim
of
wild
water
canyon
leaning
far
back
in
their
saddles
they
slid
the
horses
down
a
steep
declivity
through
big
spruce
woods
to
an
ancient
and
all
but
obliterated
trail
they
cut
this
trail
back
in
the
fifties
billy
explained
i
only
found
it
by
accident
then
i
asked
poppe
yesterday
he
was
born
in
the
valley
he
said
it
was
a
fake
minin
rush
across
from
petaluma
the
gamblers
got
it
up
an
they
must
a
thousan
suckers
you
see
that
flat
there
an
the
old
stumps
that
where
the
camp
was
they
set
the
tables
up
under
the
trees
the
flat
used
to
be
bigger
but
the
creek
eaten
into
it
poppe
said
they
was
a
couple
of
killin
an
one
lying
low
against
their
horses
necks
they
scrambled
up
a
steep
cattle
trail
out
of
the
canyon
and
began
to
work
across
rough
country
toward
the
knolls
say
saxon
you
always
lookin
for
something
pretty
i
show
you
what
make
your
hair
stand
up
soon
as
we
get
through
this
never
in
all
their
travels
had
saxon
seen
so
lovely
a
vista
as
the
one
that
greeted
them
when
they
emerged
the
dim
trail
lay
like
a
rambling
red
shadow
cast
on
the
soft
forest
floor
by
the
great
redwoods
and
oaks
it
seemed
as
if
all
local
varieties
of
trees
and
vines
had
conspired
to
weave
the
leafy
roof
maples
big
madronos
and
laurels
and
lofty
oaks
scaled
and
wrapped
and
interwound
with
wild
grape
and
flaming
poison
oak
saxon
drew
billy
eyes
to
a
mossy
bank
of
ferns
all
slopes
seemed
to
meet
to
form
this
basin
and
colossal
forest
bower
underfoot
the
floor
was
spongy
with
water
an
invisible
streamlet
whispered
under
brakes
on
every
hand
opened
tiny
vistas
of
enchantment
where
young
redwoods
grouped
still
and
stately
about
fallen
giants
to
the
horses
and
dissolving
into
mold
at
last
after
another
quarter
of
an
hour
they
tied
their
horses
on
the
rim
of
the
narrow
canyon
that
penetrated
the
wilderness
of
the
knolls
through
a
rift
in
the
trees
billy
pointed
to
the
top
of
the
leaning
spruce
it
right
under
that
he
said
we
have
to
follow
up
the
bed
of
the
creek
they
ai
no
trail
though
you
see
plenty
of
deer
paths
crossin
the
creek
you
get
your
feet
saxon
laughed
her
joy
and
held
on
close
to
his
heels
splashing
through
pools
crawling
hand
and
foot
up
the
slippery
faces
of
rocks
and
worming
under
trunks
of
old
fallen
trees
they
ai
no
real
in
the
whole
mountain
billy
elucidated
so
the
stream
cuts
deeper
an
that
keeps
the
sides
cavin
in
they
as
steep
as
they
can
be
without
fallin
down
a
little
farther
up
the
canyon
ai
much
a
crack
in
the
ground
but
a
mighty
deep
one
if
anybody
should
ask
you
you
can
spit
across
it
an
break
your
neck
in
the
climbing
grew
more
difficult
and
they
were
finally
halted
in
a
narrow
cleft
by
a
you
wait
here
billy
directed
and
lying
flat
squirmed
on
through
crashing
brush
saxon
waited
till
all
sound
had
died
away
she
waited
ten
minutes
longer
then
followed
by
the
way
billy
had
broken
where
the
bed
of
the
canyon
became
impossible
she
came
upon
what
she
was
sure
was
a
deer
path
that
skirted
the
steep
side
and
was
a
tunnel
through
the
close
greenery
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
overhanging
spruce
almost
above
her
head
on
the
opposite
side
and
emerged
on
a
pool
of
clear
water
in
a
basin
this
basin
was
of
recent
origin
having
been
formed
by
a
slide
of
earth
and
trees
across
the
pool
arose
an
almost
sheer
wall
of
white
she
recognized
it
for
what
it
was
and
looked
about
for
billy
she
heard
him
whistle
and
looked
up
two
hundred
feet
above
at
the
perilous
top
of
the
white
wall
he
was
holding
on
to
a
tree
trunk
the
overhanging
spruce
was
nearby
i
can
see
the
little
pasture
back
of
your
field
he
called
down
no
wonder
nobody
ever
piped
this
off
the
only
place
they
could
see
it
from
is
that
speck
of
pasture
an
you
saw
it
first
wait
till
i
come
down
and
tell
you
all
about
it
i
did
dast
it
required
no
shrewdness
to
guess
the
truth
saxon
knew
this
was
the
precious
clay
required
by
the
brickyard
billy
circled
wide
of
the
slide
and
came
down
the
from
tree
to
tree
as
descending
a
ladder
ai
it
a
peach
he
exulted
as
he
dropped
beside
her
just
look
at
it
hidden
away
under
four
feet
of
soil
where
nobody
could
see
it
just
waitin
for
us
to
hit
the
valley
of
the
moon
then
it
up
an
slides
a
piece
of
the
skin
off
so
as
we
can
see
is
it
the
real
clay
saxon
asked
anxiously
you
bet
your
sweet
life
i
handled
too
much
of
it
not
to
know
it
in
the
dark
just
rub
a
piece
between
your
like
that
why
i
could
tell
by
the
taste
of
it
i
eaten
enough
of
the
dust
of
the
teams
here
where
our
fun
begins
why
you
know
we
been
workin
our
heads
off
since
we
hit
this
valley
now
we
on
easy
but
you
do
own
it
saxon
objected
well

wo
be
a
hundred
years
old
before
i
do
straight
from
here

baby
i

the
brickyard
for

yard

they
be
crazy
with
joy
when
they
see
it
do
need
any
borin
they
nearly
two
hundred
feet
of
it
exposed
up
an
down
the
whole
knoll
clay
with
a
skin
of
soil
over
but
you

all
the
beautiful
canyon
hauling

the
clay

cried
with
alarm
nope

the
other
side

only
half
a
mile

twenty
cents
a
yard
pourin
in
all
profit
from
the
jump
i
sure
have
to
buy
more
horses
to
do
the
they
sat
hand
in
hand
beside
the
pool
and
talked
over
the
details
say
saxon
billy
said
after
a
pause
had
fallen
sing
days
wo
you
and
when
she
had
complied
the
first
time
you
sung
that
song
for
me
was
comin
home
from
the
picnic
on
the
train
the
very
first
day
we
met
each
other
she
broke
in
what
did
you
think
about
me
that
day
why
what
i
thought
ever
since
that
you
was
made
for
i
thought
that
right
at
the
jump
in
the
first
waltz
an
what
you
think
of
me
oh
i
wondered
and
before
the
first
waltz
too
when
we
were
introduced
and
shook
hands
i
wondered
if
you
were
the
man
those
were
the
very
words
that
flashed
into
my
is
he
the
man
an
i
kinda
looked
a
little
some
good
to
you
he
queried
thought
so
and
my
eyesight
has
always
been
say
billy
went
off
at
a
tangent
by
next
winter
with
everything
hummin
an
shipshape
what
the
matter
with
us
makin
a
visit
to
carmel
it
be
slack
time
for
you
with
the
vegetables
an
i
be
able
to
afford
a
saxon
lack
of
enthusiasm
surprised
him
what
wrong
he
demanded
quickly
with
downcast
demurest
eyes
and
hesitating
speech
saxon
said
i
did
something
yesterday
without
asking
your
advice
he
waited
i
wrote
to
tom
she
added
with
an
air
of
timid
confession
still
he
waited
for
he
knew
not
what
i
asked
him
to
ship
up
the
old
chest
of
drawers
my
mother
you
remember
that
we
stored
with
huh
i
do
see
anything
outa
the
way
about
that
billy
said
with
relief
we
need
the
chest
do
we
an
we
can
afford
to
pay
the
freight
on
it
ca
we
you
are
a
dear
stupid
man
that
what
you
are
do
you
know
what
is
in
the
chest
he
shook
his
head
and
what
she
added
was
so
soft
that
it
was
almost
a
whisper
the
baby
no
he
exclaimed
sure
she
nodded
her
head
her
cheeks
flooding
with
quick
color
it
what
i
wanted
saxon
anything
else
in
the
world
i
been
thinkin
a
whole
lot
about
it
lately
ever
since
we
hit
the
valley
he
went
on
brokenly
and
for
the
first
time
she
saw
tears
unmistakable
in
his
eyes
but
after
all
i
done
an
the
hell
i
raised
everything
i
i
never
urged
you
or
said
a
word
about
it
but
i
wanted
it
oh
i
wanted
it
like
like
i
want
you
his
open
arms
received
her
and
the
pool
in
the
heart
of
the
canyon
knew
a
tender
silence
saxon
felt
billy
finger
laid
warningly
on
her
lips
guided
by
his
hand
she
turned
her
head
back
and
together
they
gazed
far
up
the
side
of
the
knoll
where
a
doe
and
a
spotted
fawn
looked
down
upon
them
from
a
tiny
open
space
between
the
trees
