the
following
memoir
was
written
from
the
dictation
of
josiah
henson
a
portion
of
the
story
was
told
which
when
written
was
read
to
him
that
any
errors
of
statement
might
be
corrected
the
substance
of
it
therefore
the
facts
the
reflections
and
very
often
the
words
are
his
and
little
more
than
the
structure
of
the
sentences
belongs
to
another
the
narrative
in
this
form
necessarily
loses
the
attraction
derived
from
the
earnest
manner
the
natural
eloquence
of
a
man
who
tells
a
story
in
which
he
is
deeply
interested
but
it
is
hoped
that
enough
remains
to
repay
perusal
and
that
the
character
of
the
man
and
the
striking
nature
of
the
events
of
his
life
will
be
thought
to
justify
the
endeavor
to
make
them
more
extensively
known
the
story
has
this
advantage
that
it
is
not
fiction
but
fact
and
it
will
be
found
fruitful
in
instruction
by
those
who
attentively
consider
its
lessons
life
of
josiah
henson
i
was
born
june
in
charles
county
maryland
on
a
farm
belonging
to
francis
about
a
mile
from
port
tobacco
my
mother
was
the
property
of
josiah
but
was
hired
by
to
whom
my
father
belonged
the
only
incident
i
can
remember
which
occurred
while
my
mother
continued
on
s
farm
was
the
appearance
of
my
father
one
day
with
his
head
bloody
and
his
back
lacerated
he
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
and
though
it
was
all
a
mystery
to
me
at
the
age
of
three
or
four
years
it
was
explained
at
a
later
period
and
i
understood
that
he
had
been
suffering
the
cruel
penalty
of
the
maryland
law
for
beating
a
white
man
his
right
ear
had
been
cut
off
close
to
his
head
and
he
had
received
a
hundred
lashes
on
his
back
he
had
beaten
the
overseer
for
a
brutal
assault
on
my
mother
and
this
was
his
punishment
furious
at
such
treatment
my
father
became
a
different
man
and
was
so
morose
disobedient
and
intractable
that
determined
to
sell
him
he
accordingly
parted
with
him
not
long
after
to
his
son
who
lived
in
alabama
and
neither
my
mother
nor
i
ever
heard
of
him
again
he
was
naturally
as
i
understood
afterwards
from
my
mother
and
other
persons
a
man
of
amiable
temper
and
of
considerable
energy
of
character
but
it
is
not
strange
that
he
should
be
essentially
changed
by
such
cruelty
and
injustice
under
the
sanction
of
law
after
the
sale
of
my
father
by
and
his
leaving
maryland
for
alabama
mcp
would
no
longer
hire
out
my
mother
to
she
returned
therefore
to
the
estate
of
the
doctor
who
was
very
much
kinder
to
his
slaves
than
the
generality
of
planters
never
suffering
them
to
be
struck
by
any
one
he
was
indeed
a
man
of
good
natural
impulses
liberal
and
jovial
the
latter
quality
was
so
much
developed
as
to
be
his
great
failing
and
though
his
convivial
excesses
were
not
thought
of
as
a
fault
by
the
community
in
which
he
lived
and
did
not
even
prevent
his
having
a
high
reputation
for
goodness
of
heart
and
an
almost
benevolence
yet
they
were
nevertheless
his
ruin
my
mother
and
her
young
family
of
three
girls
and
three
boys
of
which
i
was
the
youngest
resided
on
this
estate
for
two
or
three
years
during
which
my
only
recollections
are
of
being
rather
a
pet
of
the
doctor
s
who
thought
i
was
a
bright
child
and
of
being
much
impressed
with
what
i
afterwards
recognized
as
the
deep
piety
and
devotional
feeling
and
habits
of
my
mother
i
do
not
know
how
or
where
she
acquired
her
knowledge
of
god
or
her
acquaintance
with
the
lord
s
prayer
which
she
so
frequently
repeated
and
taught
me
to
repeat
i
remember
seeing
her
often
on
her
knees
endeavoring
to
arrange
her
thoughts
in
prayers
appropriate
to
her
situation
but
which
amounted
to
little
more
than
constant
ejaculation
and
the
repetition
of
short
phrases
which
were
within
my
infant
comprehension
and
have
remained
in
my
memory
to
this
hour
after
this
brief
period
of
comparative
comfort
however
the
death
of
mcp
brought
about
a
revolution
in
our
condition
which
common
as
such
things
are
in
slave
countries
can
never
be
imagined
by
those
not
subject
to
them
nor
recollected
by
those
who
have
been
without
emotions
of
grief
and
indignation
deep
and
ineffaceable
the
doctor
was
riding
from
one
of
his
scenes
of
riotous
excess
when
falling
from
his
horse
in
crossing
a
little
run
not
a
foot
deep
he
was
unable
to
save
himself
from
drowning
in
consequence
of
his
decease
it
became
necessary
to
sell
the
estate
and
the
slaves
in
order
to
divide
the
property
among
the
heirs
and
we
were
all
put
up
at
auction
and
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
and
scattered
over
various
parts
of
the
country
my
brothers
and
sisters
were
bid
off
one
by
one
while
my
mother
holding
my
hand
looked
on
in
an
agony
of
grief
the
cause
of
which
i
but
ill
understood
at
first
but
which
dawned
on
my
mind
with
dreadful
clearness
as
the
sale
proceeded
my
mother
was
then
separated
from
me
and
put
up
in
her
turn
she
was
bought
by
a
man
named
isaac
residing
in
montgomery
county
and
then
i
was
offered
to
the
assembled
purchasers
my
mother
half
distracted
with
the
parting
forever
from
all
her
children
pushed
through
the
crowd
while
the
bidding
for
me
was
going
on
to
the
spot
where
was
standing
she
fell
at
his
feet
and
clung
to
his
knees
entreating
him
in
tones
that
a
mother
only
could
command
to
buy
her
as
well
as
herself
and
spare
to
her
one
of
her
little
ones
at
least
will
it
can
it
be
believed
that
this
man
thus
appealed
to
was
capable
not
merely
of
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
her
supplication
but
of
disengaging
himself
from
her
with
such
violent
blows
and
kicks
as
to
reduce
her
to
the
necessity
of
creeping
out
of
his
reach
and
mingling
the
groan
of
bodily
suffering
with
the
sob
of
a
breaking
heart
yet
this
was
one
of
my
earliest
observations
of
men
an
experience
which
has
been
common
to
me
with
thousands
of
my
race
the
bitterness
of
which
its
frequency
can
not
diminish
to
any
individual
who
suffers
it
while
it
is
dark
enough
to
overshadow
the
whole
with
something
blacker
than
a
funeral
i
was
bought
by
a
almost
immediately
however
whether
my
childish
strength
at
five
or
six
years
of
age
was
overmastered
by
such
scenes
and
experiences
or
from
some
accidental
cause
i
fell
sick
and
seemed
to
my
new
master
so
little
likely
to
recover
that
he
proposed
to
the
purchaser
of
my
mother
to
take
me
too
at
such
a
trifling
rate
that
it
could
not
be
refused
i
was
thus
providentially
restored
to
my
mother
and
under
her
care
destitute
as
she
was
of
the
proper
means
of
nursing
me
i
recovered
my
health
and
grew
up
to
be
an
uncommonly
vigorous
and
healthy
boy
and
man
the
character
of
the
master
whom
i
faithfully
served
for
many
years
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
one
in
any
part
of
the
world
but
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
a
domestic
institution
should
anywhere
put
it
in
the
power
of
such
a
one
to
tyrannize
over
his
fellow
beings
and
inflict
so
much
needless
misery
as
is
sure
to
be
produced
by
such
a
man
in
such
a
position
coarse
and
vulgar
in
his
habits
unprincipled
and
cruel
in
his
general
deportment
and
especially
addicted
to
the
vice
of
licentiousness
his
slaves
had
little
opportunity
for
relaxation
from
wearying
labor
were
supplied
with
the
scantiest
means
of
sustaining
their
toil
by
necessary
food
and
had
no
security
for
personal
rights
the
natural
tendency
of
slavery
is
to
convert
the
master
into
a
tyrant
and
the
slave
into
the
cringing
treacherous
false
and
thieving
victim
of
tyranny
and
his
slaves
were
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
but
might
be
cited
as
apt
illustrations
of
the
nature
of
the
case
my
earliest
employments
were
to
carry
buckets
of
water
to
the
men
at
work
to
hold
a
used
for
weeding
between
the
rows
of
corn
and
as
i
grew
older
and
taller
to
take
care
of
master
s
then
a
hoe
was
put
into
my
hands
and
i
was
soon
required
to
do
the
day
s
work
of
a
man
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
could
do
it
at
least
as
well
as
my
associates
in
misery
the
life
of
a
slave
on
one
of
our
southern
plantations
however
frequently
it
may
have
been
described
is
generally
little
known
at
the
north
and
must
be
mentioned
as
a
necessary
illustration
of
the
character
and
habits
of
the
slave
and
the
created
and
perpetuated
by
their
relative
position
the
principal
food
of
those
upon
my
master
s
plantation
consisted
of
corn
meal
and
salt
herrings
to
which
was
added
in
summer
a
little
buttermilk
and
the
few
vegetables
which
each
might
raise
for
himself
and
his
family
on
the
little
piece
of
ground
which
was
assigned
to
him
for
the
purpose
called
a
truck
patch
the
meals
were
two
daily
the
first
or
breakfast
was
taken
at
o
clock
after
laboring
from
daylight
and
the
other
when
the
work
of
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
over
the
only
dress
was
of
tow
cloth
which
for
the
young
and
often
even
for
those
who
had
passed
the
period
of
childhood
consisted
of
a
single
garment
something
like
a
shirt
but
longer
reaching
to
the
ancles
and
for
the
older
a
pair
of
pantaloons
or
a
gown
according
to
the
sex
while
some
kind
of
round
jacket
or
overcoat
might
be
added
in
winter
a
wool
hat
once
in
two
or
three
years
for
the
males
and
a
pair
of
coarse
shoes
once
a
year
our
lodging
was
in
log
huts
of
a
single
small
room
with
no
other
floor
than
the
trodden
earth
in
which
ten
or
a
dozen
persons
men
women
and
children
might
sleep
but
which
could
not
protect
them
from
dampness
and
cold
nor
permit
the
existence
of
the
common
decencies
of
life
there
were
neither
beds
nor
furniture
of
any
description
a
blanket
being
the
only
addition
to
the
dress
of
the
day
for
protection
from
the
chillness
of
the
air
or
the
earth
in
these
hovels
were
we
penned
at
night
and
fed
by
day
here
were
the
children
born
and
the
sick
neglected
such
were
the
provisions
for
the
daily
toil
of
the
slave
notwithstanding
this
system
of
management
however
i
grew
to
be
a
robust
and
vigorous
lad
and
at
fifteen
years
of
age
there
were
few
who
could
compete
with
me
in
work
or
in
sport
for
not
even
the
condition
of
a
slave
can
altogether
repress
the
animal
spirits
of
the
young
negro
i
was
competent
to
all
the
work
that
was
done
upon
the
farm
and
could
run
faster
and
farther
wrestle
longer
and
jump
higher
than
anybody
about
me
my
master
and
my
fellow
slaves
used
to
look
upon
me
and
speak
of
me
as
a
wonderfully
smart
fellow
and
prophecy
the
great
things
i
should
do
when
i
became
a
man
a
casual
word
of
this
sort
sometimes
overheard
would
fill
me
with
a
pride
and
ambition
which
some
would
think
impossible
in
a
negro
slave
degraded
starved
and
abused
as
i
was
and
had
been
from
my
earliest
recollection
but
the
love
of
superiority
is
not
confined
to
kings
and
emperors
and
it
is
a
positive
fact
that
pride
and
ambition
were
as
active
in
my
soul
as
probably
they
ever
were
in
that
of
the
greatest
soldier
or
statesman
the
objects
i
pursued
i
must
admit
were
not
just
the
same
as
theirs
mine
were
to
be
first
in
the
field
whether
we
were
hoeing
mowing
or
reaping
to
surpass
those
of
my
own
age
or
indeed
any
age
in
athletic
exercises
and
to
obtain
if
possible
the
favorable
regard
of
the
petty
despot
who
ruled
over
us
this
last
was
an
exercise
of
the
understanding
rather
than
of
the
affections
and
i
was
guided
in
it
more
by
what
i
supposed
would
be
effectual
than
by
a
nice
judgment
of
the
propriety
of
the
means
i
used
i
obtained
great
influence
with
my
companions
as
well
by
the
superiority
i
showed
in
labor
and
in
sport
as
by
the
assistance
i
yielded
them
and
the
favors
i
conferred
upon
them
from
impulses
which
i
can
not
consider
as
wrong
though
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
conceal
sometimes
the
act
as
well
as
its
motive
i
have
toiled
and
induced
others
to
toil
many
an
extra
hour
in
order
to
show
my
master
what
an
excellent
day
s
work
had
been
accomplished
and
to
win
a
kind
word
or
a
benevolent
deed
from
his
callous
heart
in
general
indifference
or
a
cool
calculation
of
my
value
to
him
were
my
reward
chilling
those
hopes
of
an
improvement
in
my
condition
which
was
the
ultimate
object
of
my
efforts
i
was
much
more
easily
moved
to
compassion
and
sympathy
than
he
was
and
one
of
the
means
i
took
to
gain
the
of
my
fellow
sufferers
was
by
taking
from
him
some
things
that
he
did
not
give
in
part
payment
of
my
extra
labor
the
condition
of
the
male
slave
is
bad
enough
heaven
knows
but
that
of
the
female
compelled
to
perform
unfit
labor
sick
suffering
and
bearing
the
burdens
of
her
own
sex
unpitied
and
unaided
as
well
as
the
toils
which
belong
to
the
other
has
often
oppressed
me
with
a
load
of
sympathy
and
sometimes
when
i
have
seen
them
starved
and
miserable
and
unable
to
help
themselves
i
have
helped
them
to
some
of
the
comforts
which
they
were
denied
by
him
who
owned
them
and
which
my
companions
had
not
the
wit
or
the
daring
to
procure
meat
was
not
a
part
of
our
regular
food
but
my
master
had
plenty
of
sheep
and
pigs
and
sometimes
i
have
picked
out
the
best
one
i
could
find
in
the
flock
or
the
drove
carried
it
a
mile
or
two
into
the
woods
slaughtered
it
cut
it
up
and
distributed
it
among
the
poor
creatures
to
whom
it
was
at
once
food
luxury
and
medicine
was
this
wrong
i
can
only
say
that
at
this
distance
of
time
my
conscience
does
not
reproach
me
for
it
and
that
then
i
esteemed
it
among
the
best
of
my
deeds
by
means
of
the
influence
thus
acquired
the
increased
amount
of
work
done
upon
the
farm
and
by
the
detection
of
the
knavery
of
the
overseer
who
plundered
his
employer
for
more
selfish
ends
and
through
my
watchfulness
was
caught
in
the
act
and
dismissed
i
was
promoted
to
be
superintendent
of
the
farm
work
and
managed
to
raise
more
than
double
the
crops
with
more
cheerful
and
willing
labor
than
was
ever
seen
on
the
estate
before
previous
to
my
attaining
this
important
station
however
an
incident
occurred
of
so
powerful
an
influence
on
my
intellectual
development
my
prospect
of
improvement
in
character
as
well
as
condition
my
chance
of
religious
culture
and
in
short
on
my
whole
nature
body
and
soul
that
it
deserves
especial
notice
and
commemoration
there
was
a
person
living
at
georgetown
a
few
miles
only
from
s
plantation
whose
business
was
that
of
a
baker
and
whose
character
was
that
of
an
upright
benevolent
christian
man
he
was
noted
especially
for
his
detestation
of
slavery
and
his
resolute
avoidance
of
the
employment
of
slave
labor
in
his
business
he
would
not
even
hire
a
slave
the
price
of
whose
toil
must
be
paid
to
his
master
but
contented
himself
with
the
work
of
his
own
hands
and
with
such
free
labor
as
he
could
procure
his
reputation
was
high
not
only
for
this
almost
singular
abstinence
from
what
no
one
about
him
thought
wrong
but
for
his
general
probity
and
excellence
this
man
occasionally
served
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
and
preached
in
a
neighborhood
where
preachers
were
somewhat
rare
at
that
period
one
sunday
when
he
was
to
officiate
in
this
way
at
a
place
three
or
four
miles
distant
my
mother
persuaded
me
to
ask
master
s
leave
to
go
and
hear
him
and
although
such
permission
was
not
given
freely
or
often
yet
his
favor
to
me
was
shown
for
this
once
by
allowing
me
to
go
without
much
scolding
but
not
without
a
pretty
distinct
intimation
of
what
would
befall
me
if
i
did
not
return
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
service
i
hurried
off
pleased
with
the
opportunity
but
without
any
definite
expectations
of
benefit
or
amusement
for
up
to
this
period
of
my
life
and
i
was
then
eighteen
years
old
i
had
never
heard
a
sermon
nor
any
discourse
or
conversation
whatever
upon
religious
topics
except
what
had
been
impressed
upon
me
by
my
mother
of
the
responsibility
of
all
to
a
supreme
being
when
i
arrived
at
the
place
of
meeting
the
services
were
so
far
advanced
that
the
speaker
was
just
beginning
his
discourse
from
the
text
hebrews
ii
that
he
by
the
grace
of
god
should
taste
of
death
for
every
this
was
the
first
text
of
the
bible
to
which
i
had
ever
listened
knowing
it
to
be
such
i
have
never
forgotten
it
and
scarce
a
day
has
passed
since
in
which
i
have
not
recalled
it
and
the
sermon
that
was
preached
from
it
the
divine
character
of
jesus
christ
his
life
and
teachings
his
sacrifice
of
himself
for
others
his
death
and
resurrection
were
all
alluded
to
and
some
of
the
points
were
dwelt
upon
with
great
power
great
at
least
to
me
who
heard
of
these
things
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
wonderfully
impressed
too
with
the
use
which
the
preacher
made
of
the
last
words
of
the
text
every
he
said
the
death
of
christ
was
not
designed
for
the
benefit
of
a
select
few
only
but
for
the
salvation
of
the
world
for
the
bond
as
well
as
the
free
and
he
dwelt
on
the
glad
tidings
of
the
gospel
to
the
poor
the
persecuted
and
the
distressed
its
deliverance
to
the
captive
and
the
liberty
wherewith
christ
has
made
us
free
till
my
heart
burned
within
me
and
i
was
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
excitement
at
the
thought
that
such
a
being
as
jesus
christ
had
been
described
should
have
died
for
me
for
among
the
rest
a
poor
despised
abused
slave
who
was
thought
by
his
fellow
creatures
fit
for
nothing
but
unrequited
toil
and
ignorance
for
mental
and
bodily
degradation
i
immediately
determined
to
find
out
something
more
about
christ
and
him
crucified
and
revolving
the
things
which
i
had
heard
in
my
mind
as
i
went
home
i
became
so
excited
that
i
turned
aside
from
the
road
into
the
woods
and
prayed
to
god
for
light
and
for
aid
with
an
earnestness
which
however
unenlightened
was
at
least
sincere
and
heartfelt
and
which
the
subsequent
course
of
my
life
has
led
me
to
imagine
might
not
have
been
unacceptable
to
him
who
heareth
prayer
at
all
events
i
date
my
conversion
and
my
awakening
to
a
new
life
a
consciousness
of
superior
powers
and
destiny
to
any
thing
i
had
before
conceived
of
from
this
day
so
memorable
to
me
i
used
every
means
and
opportunity
of
inquiry
into
religious
matters
and
so
deep
was
my
conviction
of
their
superior
importance
to
every
thing
else
so
clear
my
perception
of
my
own
faults
and
so
undoubting
my
observation
of
the
darkness
and
sin
that
surrounded
me
that
i
could
not
help
talking
much
on
these
subjects
with
those
about
me
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
began
to
pray
with
them
and
exhort
them
and
to
impart
to
the
poor
slaves
those
little
glimmerings
of
light
from
another
world
which
had
reached
my
own
eye
in
a
few
years
i
became
quite
an
esteemed
preacher
among
them
and
i
will
not
believe
it
is
vanity
which
leads
me
to
think
i
was
useful
to
some
i
must
return
however
for
the
present
to
the
course
of
my
life
in
secular
affairs
the
facts
of
which
it
is
my
principal
object
to
relate
the
difference
between
the
manner
in
which
it
was
designed
that
all
men
should
regard
one
another
as
children
of
the
same
father
and
the
manner
in
which
men
actually
do
treat
each
other
as
if
they
were
placed
here
for
mutual
annoyance
and
destruction
is
well
exemplified
by
an
incident
that
happened
to
me
within
a
year
or
two
from
this
period
that
is
when
i
was
nineteen
or
twenty
years
old
my
master
s
habits
were
such
as
were
common
enough
among
the
dissipated
planters
of
the
neighborhood
and
one
of
their
frequent
practices
was
to
assemble
on
saturday
or
sunday
which
were
their
holidays
and
gamble
run
horses
or
fight
discuss
politics
and
drink
whiskey
and
brandy
and
water
all
day
long
perfectly
aware
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
find
their
own
way
home
at
night
each
one
ordered
a
slave
his
particular
attendant
to
come
after
him
and
help
him
home
i
was
chosen
for
this
confidential
duty
by
my
master
and
many
is
the
time
i
have
held
him
on
his
horse
when
he
could
not
hold
himself
in
the
saddle
and
walked
by
his
side
in
darkness
and
mud
from
the
tavern
to
his
house
of
course
quarrels
and
brawls
of
the
most
violent
description
were
frequent
consequences
of
these
meetings
and
whenever
they
became
especially
dangerous
and
glasses
were
thrown
dirks
drawn
and
pistols
fired
it
was
the
duty
of
the
slaves
to
rush
in
and
each
one
was
to
drag
his
master
from
the
fight
and
carry
him
home
to
tell
the
truth
this
was
a
part
of
my
business
for
which
i
felt
no
reluctance
i
was
young
remarkably
athletic
and
and
in
such
affrays
i
carried
it
with
a
high
hand
and
would
elbow
my
way
among
the
whites
whom
it
would
have
been
almost
death
for
me
to
strike
seize
my
master
and
drag
him
out
mount
him
on
his
horse
or
crowd
him
into
his
buggy
with
the
ease
with
which
i
would
handle
a
bag
of
corn
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
pride
of
conscious
superiority
and
the
kindness
inspired
by
performing
an
act
of
benevolence
i
knew
i
was
doing
for
him
what
he
could
not
do
for
himself
and
showing
my
superiority
to
others
and
acquiring
their
respect
in
some
degree
at
the
same
time
on
one
of
these
occasions
my
master
got
into
a
quarrel
with
his
brother
s
overseer
who
was
one
of
the
party
and
in
rescuing
the
former
i
suppose
i
was
a
little
more
rough
with
the
latter
than
usual
i
remember
his
falling
upon
the
floor
and
very
likely
it
was
from
the
effects
of
a
push
from
me
or
a
movement
of
my
elbow
he
attributed
his
fall
to
me
rather
than
to
the
whiskey
he
had
drunk
and
treasured
up
his
vengeance
for
the
first
favorable
opportunity
about
a
week
afterwards
i
was
sent
by
my
master
to
a
place
a
few
miles
distant
on
horseback
with
some
letters
i
took
a
short
cut
through
a
lane
separated
by
gates
from
the
high
road
and
bounded
by
a
fence
on
each
side
this
lane
passed
through
some
of
the
farm
owned
by
my
master
s
brother
and
his
overseer
was
in
the
adjoining
field
with
three
negroes
when
i
went
by
on
my
return
a
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
overseer
was
sitting
on
the
fence
but
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
black
fellows
i
rode
on
utterly
unsuspicious
of
any
trouble
but
as
i
approached
he
jumped
off
the
fence
and
at
the
same
moment
two
of
the
negroes
sprung
up
from
under
the
bushes
where
they
had
been
concealed
and
stood
with
him
immediately
in
front
of
me
while
the
third
sprang
over
the
fence
just
behind
me
i
was
thus
enclosed
between
what
i
could
no
longer
doubt
were
hostile
forces
the
overseer
seized
my
horse
s
bridle
and
ordered
me
to
alight
in
the
usual
elegant
phraseology
used
by
such
men
to
slaves
i
asked
what
i
was
to
alight
for
to
take
the
cursedest
flogging
you
ever
had
in
your
life
you
d
black
but
what
am
i
to
be
flogged
for
i
asked
not
a
word
said
he
but
light
at
once
and
take
off
your
i
saw
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
and
slipped
off
the
horse
on
the
opposite
side
from
him
now
take
off
your
shirt
cried
he
and
as
i
demurred
at
this
he
lifted
a
stick
he
had
in
his
hand
to
strike
me
but
so
suddenly
and
violently
that
he
frightened
the
horse
which
broke
away
from
him
and
ran
home
i
was
thus
left
without
means
of
escape
to
sustain
the
attacks
of
four
men
as
well
as
i
might
in
avoiding
s
blow
i
had
accidentally
got
into
a
corner
of
the
fence
where
i
could
not
be
approached
except
in
front
the
overseer
called
upon
the
negroes
to
seize
me
but
they
knowing
something
of
my
physical
power
were
rather
slow
to
obey
at
length
they
did
their
best
and
as
they
brought
themselves
within
my
reach
i
knocked
them
down
successively
and
one
of
them
trying
to
trip
up
my
feet
when
he
was
down
i
gave
him
a
kick
with
my
heavy
shoe
which
knocked
out
several
of
his
front
teeth
and
sent
him
groaning
away
meanwhile
the
cowardly
overseer
was
availing
himself
of
every
opportunity
to
hit
me
over
the
head
with
his
stick
which
was
not
heavy
enough
to
knock
me
down
though
it
drew
blood
freely
at
length
tired
of
the
length
of
the
affray
he
seized
a
stake
six
or
seven
feet
long
from
the
fence
and
struck
at
me
with
his
whole
strength
in
attempting
to
ward
off
the
blow
my
right
arm
was
broken
and
i
was
brought
to
the
ground
where
repeated
blows
broke
both
my
shoulder
blades
and
made
the
blood
gush
from
my
mouth
copiously
the
two
blacks
begged
him
not
to
murder
me
and
he
just
left
me
as
i
was
telling
me
to
learn
what
it
was
to
strike
a
white
man
the
alarm
had
been
raised
at
the
house
by
seeing
the
horse
come
back
without
his
rider
and
it
was
not
long
before
assistance
arrived
to
convey
me
home
it
may
be
supposed
it
was
not
done
without
some
suffering
on
my
part
as
besides
my
broken
arm
and
the
wounds
on
my
head
i
could
feel
and
hear
the
pieces
of
my
grate
against
each
other
with
every
breath
no
physician
or
surgeon
was
called
to
dress
my
wounds
and
i
never
knew
one
to
be
called
to
a
slave
upon
s
estate
on
any
occasion
whatever
and
have
no
knowledge
of
such
a
thing
being
done
on
any
estate
in
the
neighborhood
i
was
attended
if
it
may
be
called
attendance
by
my
master
s
sister
who
had
some
reputation
in
such
affairs
and
she
splintered
my
arm
and
bound
up
my
back
as
well
as
she
knew
how
and
nature
did
the
rest
it
was
five
months
before
i
could
work
at
all
and
the
first
time
i
tried
to
plough
a
hard
knock
of
the
colter
against
a
stone
shattered
my
again
and
gave
me
even
greater
agony
than
at
first
i
have
been
unable
to
raise
my
hands
to
my
head
from
that
day
to
this
my
master
prosecuted
for
abusing
and
maiming
his
slave
and
when
the
case
was
tried
before
the
magistrate
he
made
a
statement
of
the
facts
as
i
have
here
related
them
when
was
called
upon
to
say
why
he
should
not
be
fined
for
the
offence
he
simply
stated
without
being
put
on
oath
that
he
had
acted
in
that
i
had
assaulted
him
and
that
nothing
had
saved
him
from
being
killed
on
the
spot
by
so
stout
a
fellow
but
the
fortunate
circumstance
that
his
three
negroes
were
within
call
the
result
was
that
my
master
paid
all
the
costs
of
court
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
calling
a
liar
and
scoundrel
and
afterwards
of
beating
him
in
a
very
thorough
manner
for
which
he
had
also
to
pay
a
fine
and
costs
my
situation
as
overseer
i
retained
together
with
the
especial
favor
of
my
master
who
was
not
displeased
either
with
saving
the
expense
of
a
large
salary
for
a
white
superintendent
or
with
the
superior
crops
i
was
able
to
raise
for
him
i
will
not
deny
that
i
used
his
property
more
freely
than
he
would
have
done
himself
in
supplying
his
people
with
better
food
but
if
i
cheated
him
in
this
way
in
small
matters
it
was
unequivocally
for
his
own
benefit
in
more
important
ones
and
i
accounted
with
the
strictest
honesty
for
every
dollar
i
received
in
the
sale
of
the
property
entrusted
to
me
gradually
the
disposal
of
every
thing
raised
on
the
farm
the
wheat
oats
hay
fruit
butter
and
whatever
else
there
might
be
was
confided
to
me
as
it
was
quite
evident
that
i
could
and
did
sell
for
better
prices
than
any
one
else
he
could
employ
and
he
was
quite
incompetent
to
attend
to
the
business
himself
for
many
years
i
was
his
factotum
and
supplied
him
with
all
his
means
for
all
his
purposes
whether
they
were
good
or
bad
i
had
no
reason
to
think
highly
of
his
moral
character
but
it
was
my
duty
to
be
faithful
to
him
in
the
position
in
which
he
placed
me
and
i
can
boldly
declare
before
god
and
man
that
i
was
so
i
forgave
him
the
causeless
blows
and
injuries
he
had
inflicted
on
me
in
childhood
and
youth
and
was
proud
of
the
favor
he
now
showed
me
and
of
the
character
and
reputation
i
had
earned
by
strenuous
and
persevering
efforts
when
i
was
about
years
of
age
i
married
a
very
efficient
and
for
a
slave
a
very
girl
belonging
to
a
neighboring
family
reputed
to
be
pious
and
kind
whom
i
first
met
at
the
chapel
i
attended
and
during
nearly
forty
years
that
have
since
elapsed
i
have
had
no
reason
to
regret
the
connection
but
many
to
rejoice
in
it
and
be
grateful
for
it
she
has
borne
me
twelve
children
eight
of
whom
survive
and
promise
to
be
the
comfort
of
my
declining
years
things
remained
in
this
condition
for
a
considerable
period
my
occupations
being
to
superintend
the
farming
operations
and
to
sell
the
produce
in
the
neighboring
markets
of
washington
and
georgetown
many
respectable
people
yet
living
there
may
possibly
have
some
recollection
of
siah
or
si
as
they
used
to
call
me
as
their
but
if
they
have
forgotten
me
i
remember
them
with
an
honest
satisfaction
after
passing
his
youth
in
the
manner
i
have
mentioned
in
a
general
way
and
which
i
do
not
wish
more
particularly
to
describe
my
master
at
the
age
of
or
upwards
married
a
young
woman
of
eighteen
who
had
some
little
property
and
more
thrift
her
economy
was
remarkable
and
was
certainly
no
addition
to
the
comfort
of
the
establishment
she
had
a
younger
brother
francis
to
whom
was
appointed
guardian
and
who
used
to
complain
not
without
reason
i
am
confident
of
the
meanness
of
the
provision
made
for
the
household
and
he
would
often
come
to
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
tell
me
he
could
not
get
enough
to
eat
i
made
him
my
friend
for
life
by
sympathizing
in
his
emotions
and
satisfying
his
appetite
sharing
with
him
the
food
i
took
care
to
provide
for
my
own
family
after
a
time
however
continual
dissipation
was
more
than
a
match
for
domestic
saving
my
master
fell
into
difficulty
and
from
difficulty
into
a
lawsuit
with
a
who
charged
him
with
dishonest
mismanagement
of
property
confided
to
him
in
trust
the
lawsuit
was
protracted
enough
to
cause
his
ruin
of
itself
he
used
every
resource
to
stave
off
the
inevitable
result
but
at
length
saw
no
means
of
relief
but
removal
to
another
state
he
often
came
to
my
cabin
to
pass
the
evening
in
lamentations
over
his
misfortune
in
cursing
his
and
in
asking
my
advice
and
assistance
the
first
time
he
ever
intimated
to
me
his
ultimate
project
he
said
he
was
ruined
that
every
thing
was
gone
that
there
was
but
one
resource
and
that
depended
upon
me
how
can
that
be
master
said
i
in
astonishment
before
he
would
explain
himself
however
he
begged
me
to
promise
to
do
what
he
should
propose
well
knowing
from
his
past
experience
of
my
character
that
i
should
hold
myself
bound
by
such
promise
to
do
all
that
it
implied
if
it
were
within
the
limits
of
possibility
solicited
in
this
way
with
urgency
and
tears
by
the
man
whom
i
had
so
zealously
served
for
twenty
years
and
who
now
seemed
absolutely
dependent
upon
his
slave
impelled
too
by
the
fear
which
he
skilfully
awakened
that
the
sheriff
would
seize
every
one
who
belonged
to
him
and
that
all
would
be
separated
or
perhaps
sold
to
go
to
georgia
or
louisiana
an
object
of
perpetual
dread
to
the
slave
of
the
more
northern
states
i
consented
and
promised
faithfully
to
do
all
i
could
to
save
him
from
the
fate
impending
over
him
he
then
told
me
i
must
take
his
slaves
to
his
brother
in
kentucky
in
vain
i
represented
to
him
that
i
had
never
travelled
a
day
s
journey
from
his
plantation
and
knew
nothing
of
the
way
or
the
means
of
getting
to
kentucky
he
insisted
that
such
a
smart
fellow
as
i
could
travel
anywhere
he
promised
to
give
me
all
necessary
instructions
and
urged
that
this
was
the
only
course
by
which
he
could
be
saved
the
result
was
that
i
agreed
to
undertake
the
enterprise
certainly
no
light
one
for
me
as
it
could
scarcely
be
considered
for
even
an
experienced
manager
there
were
eighteen
negroes
besides
my
wife
two
children
and
myself
to
transport
nearly
a
thousand
miles
through
a
country
i
knew
nothing
about
and
in
winter
time
for
we
started
in
the
month
of
february
my
master
proposed
to
follow
me
in
a
few
months
and
establish
himself
in
kentucky
he
furnished
me
with
a
small
sum
of
money
and
some
provisions
and
i
bought
a
wagon
to
carry
them
and
to
give
the
women
and
children
a
lift
now
and
then
and
the
rest
of
us
were
to
trudge
on
foot
fortunately
for
the
success
of
the
undertaking
these
people
had
been
long
under
my
direction
and
were
devotedly
attached
to
me
for
the
many
alleviations
i
had
afforded
to
their
miserable
condition
the
comforts
i
had
procured
them
and
the
consideration
which
i
had
always
manifested
for
them
under
these
circumstances
no
difficulty
arose
from
want
of
submission
to
my
authority
and
none
of
any
sort
except
that
which
i
necessarily
encountered
from
my
ignorance
of
the
country
and
my
inexperience
in
such
business
on
arriving
at
wheeling
i
sold
the
horse
and
wagon
and
purchased
a
boat
of
sufficient
size
and
floated
down
the
river
without
further
trouble
or
fatigue
stopping
every
night
to
encamp
i
said
i
had
no
further
trouble
but
there
was
one
source
of
anxiety
which
i
was
compelled
to
encounter
and
a
temptation
i
had
to
resist
the
strength
of
which
others
can
appreciate
as
well
as
myself
in
passing
along
the
state
of
ohio
we
were
frequently
told
that
we
were
free
if
we
chose
to
be
so
at
cincinnati
especially
the
colored
people
gathered
round
us
and
urged
us
with
much
importunity
to
remain
with
them
told
us
it
was
folly
to
go
on
and
in
short
used
all
the
arguments
now
so
familiar
to
induce
slaves
to
quit
their
masters
my
companions
probably
had
little
perception
of
the
nature
of
the
boon
that
was
offered
to
them
and
were
willing
to
do
just
as
i
told
them
without
a
wish
to
judge
for
themselves
not
so
with
me
from
my
earliest
recollection
freedom
had
been
the
object
of
my
ambition
a
constant
motive
to
exertion
an
stimulus
to
gain
and
to
save
no
other
means
of
obtaining
it
however
had
occurred
to
me
but
purchasing
myself
of
my
master
the
idea
of
running
away
was
not
one
that
i
had
ever
indulged
i
had
a
sentiment
of
honor
on
the
subject
or
what
i
thought
such
which
i
would
not
have
violated
even
for
freedom
and
every
cent
which
i
had
ever
felt
entitled
to
call
my
own
had
been
treasured
up
for
this
great
purpose
till
i
had
accumulated
between
thirty
and
forty
dollars
now
was
offered
to
me
an
opportunity
i
had
not
anticipated
i
might
liberate
my
family
my
companions
and
myself
without
the
smallest
risk
and
without
injustice
to
any
individual
except
one
whom
we
had
none
of
us
any
reason
to
love
who
had
been
guilty
of
cruelty
and
oppression
to
us
all
for
many
years
and
who
had
never
shown
the
smallest
symptom
of
sympathy
with
us
or
with
any
one
in
our
condition
but
i
need
not
make
the
exception
there
would
have
been
no
injustice
to
himself
it
would
have
been
a
retribution
which
might
be
called
righteous
if
i
had
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
thus
thrust
suddenly
upon
me
but
it
was
a
punishment
which
it
was
not
for
me
to
inflict
i
had
promised
that
man
to
take
his
property
to
kentucky
and
deposit
it
with
his
brother
and
this
and
this
only
i
resolved
to
do
i
left
cincinnati
before
night
though
i
had
intended
to
remain
there
and
encamped
with
my
entire
party
a
few
miles
below
the
city
what
advantages
i
may
have
lost
by
thus
throwing
away
an
opportunity
of
obtaining
freedom
i
know
not
but
the
perception
of
my
own
strength
of
character
the
feeling
of
integrity
the
sentiment
of
high
honor
i
have
these
advantages
i
do
know
and
prize
and
would
not
lose
them
nor
the
recollection
of
having
attained
them
for
all
that
i
can
imagine
to
have
resulted
from
an
earlier
release
from
bondage
i
have
often
had
painful
doubts
as
to
the
propriety
of
my
carrying
so
many
other
individuals
into
slavery
again
and
my
consoling
reflection
has
been
that
i
acted
as
i
thought
at
the
time
was
best
i
arrived
at
daviess
county
kentucky
about
the
middle
of
april
and
delivered
myself
and
my
companions
to
amos
the
brother
of
my
owner
who
had
a
large
plantation
with
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
negroes
his
house
was
situated
about
five
miles
south
of
the
ohio
river
and
fifteen
miles
above
the
yellow
banks
on
big
blackford
s
creek
there
i
remained
three
years
expecting
my
master
to
follow
and
employed
meantime
on
the
farm
of
which
i
had
the
general
management
in
consequence
of
the
recommendation
for
ability
and
honesty
which
i
brought
with
me
from
maryland
the
situation
was
in
many
respects
more
comfortable
than
that
i
had
left
the
farm
was
larger
and
more
fertile
and
there
was
a
greater
abundance
of
food
which
is
of
course
one
of
the
principal
sources
of
the
comfort
of
a
slave
debarred
as
he
is
from
so
many
enjoyments
which
other
men
can
obtain
sufficiency
of
food
is
a
pretty
important
item
in
any
man
s
account
of
life
but
is
tenfold
more
so
in
that
of
the
slave
whose
appetite
is
always
stimulated
by
as
much
labor
as
he
can
perform
and
whose
mind
is
little
occupied
by
thought
on
subjects
of
deeper
interest
my
post
of
superintendent
gave
me
some
advantages
too
of
which
i
did
not
fail
to
avail
myself
particularly
with
regard
to
those
religious
privileges
which
since
i
first
heard
of
christ
and
christianity
had
greatly
occupied
my
mind
in
kentucky
the
opportunities
of
attending
on
the
preaching
of
whites
as
well
as
of
blacks
were
more
numerous
and
partly
by
attending
them
and
the
which
occurred
from
time
to
time
and
partly
from
studying
carefully
my
own
heart
and
observing
the
developments
of
character
around
me
in
all
the
stations
of
life
which
i
could
watch
i
became
better
acquainted
with
those
religious
feelings
which
are
deeply
implanted
in
the
breast
of
every
human
being
and
learnt
by
practice
how
best
to
arouse
them
and
keep
them
excited
how
to
stir
up
the
callous
and
indifferent
and
in
general
to
produce
some
good
religious
impressions
on
the
ignorant
and
thoughtless
community
by
which
i
was
surrounded
no
great
amount
of
theological
knowledge
is
requisite
for
the
purpose
if
it
had
been
it
is
manifest
enough
that
preaching
never
could
have
been
my
vocation
but
i
am
persuaded
that
speaking
from
the
fulness
of
a
heart
deeply
impressed
with
its
own
sinfulness
and
imperfection
and
with
the
mercy
of
god
in
christ
jesus
my
humble
ministrations
have
not
been
entirely
useless
to
those
who
have
had
less
opportunity
than
myself
to
reflect
upon
these
subjects
it
is
certain
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
the
endeavor
to
do
what
i
saw
others
doing
in
this
field
and
i
labored
at
once
to
improve
myself
and
those
about
me
in
the
cultivation
of
the
harvests
which
ripen
only
in
eternity
i
can
not
but
derive
some
satisfaction
too
from
the
proofs
i
have
had
that
my
services
have
been
acceptable
to
those
to
whom
they
have
been
rendered
in
the
course
of
the
three
years
from
to
i
availed
myself
of
all
the
opportunities
of
improvement
which
occurred
and
was
admitted
as
a
preacher
by
a
conference
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
in
the
spring
of
the
year
news
arrived
from
my
master
that
he
was
unable
to
induce
his
wife
to
accompany
him
to
kentucky
and
he
must
therefore
remain
where
he
was
he
sent
out
an
agent
to
sell
all
his
slaves
but
me
and
my
family
and
to
carry
back
the
proceeds
to
him
and
now
another
of
those
scenes
was
to
be
witnessed
which
had
impressed
itself
so
deeply
on
my
childish
soul
husbands
and
wives
parents
and
children
were
to
be
separated
forever
affections
which
are
as
strong
in
the
african
as
in
the
european
were
to
be
cruelly
disregarded
and
the
iron
selfishness
generated
by
the
hateful
institution
was
to
be
exhibited
in
its
most
odious
and
naked
deformity
i
was
exempted
from
a
personal
share
in
the
dreadful
calamity
but
i
could
not
see
without
the
deepest
grief
the
agony
which
i
recollected
in
my
own
mother
and
which
was
again
brought
before
my
eyes
in
the
persons
with
whom
i
had
been
long
associated
nor
could
i
refrain
from
the
bitterest
feeling
of
hatred
of
the
system
and
those
who
sustain
it
what
else
indeed
can
be
the
feeling
of
the
slave
liable
at
every
moment
of
his
life
to
these
frightful
and
unnecessary
calamities
which
may
be
caused
by
the
caprice
of
the
abandoned
or
the
supposed
necessities
of
the
better
part
of
the
slaveholders
and
inflicted
upon
him
without
sympathy
or
redress
under
the
sanction
of
the
laws
which
uphold
the
institution
i
lamented
my
agency
in
bringing
the
poor
creatures
hither
if
such
was
to
be
the
end
of
the
expedition
but
i
could
not
reproach
myself
with
having
made
their
condition
really
worse
nor
with
any
thing
but
complying
with
the
commands
of
a
heartless
master
in
the
course
of
the
summer
of
a
methodist
preacher
a
white
man
of
some
reputation
visited
our
neighborhood
and
i
became
acquainted
with
him
he
was
soon
interested
in
me
and
visited
me
frequently
and
one
day
talked
to
me
in
a
confidential
manner
about
my
position
he
said
i
ought
to
be
free
that
i
had
too
much
capacity
to
be
confined
to
the
limited
and
comparatively
useless
sphere
of
a
slave
and
though
said
he
i
must
not
be
known
to
have
spoken
to
you
on
this
subject
yet
if
you
will
obtain
amos
s
consent
to
go
to
see
your
old
master
in
maryland
i
will
try
and
put
you
in
a
way
by
which
i
think
you
may
succeed
in
buying
he
said
this
to
me
more
than
once
and
as
it
was
in
harmony
with
all
my
aspirations
and
wishes
was
flattering
to
my
and
could
be
attended
with
no
harm
that
i
could
foresee
i
soon
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
to
get
the
necessary
leave
somewhat
to
my
surprise
master
amos
made
no
objection
but
gave
me
a
pass
to
go
to
maryland
and
back
with
some
remarks
which
showed
his
sense
of
the
value
of
my
services
to
him
and
his
opinion
that
i
had
earned
such
a
privilege
if
i
desired
it
furnished
with
this
and
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
from
my
methodist
friend
to
a
brother
preacher
in
cincinnati
i
started
about
the
middle
of
september
for
the
east
by
the
aid
of
the
good
man
to
whom
i
had
a
letter
i
had
an
opportunity
of
preaching
in
two
or
three
of
the
pulpits
of
cincinnati
when
i
took
the
opportunity
of
stating
my
purpose
and
was
liberally
aided
in
it
by
contributions
made
on
the
spot
my
friend
also
procured
some
subscriptions
in
the
city
so
that
in
three
or
four
days
i
left
it
with
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
in
my
pocket
the
annual
methodist
conference
was
about
to
be
held
at
chillicothe
to
which
my
kind
friend
accompanied
me
and
by
his
influence
and
exertions
i
succeeded
well
there
also
by
his
advice
i
then
purchased
a
suit
of
respectable
clothes
and
an
excellent
horse
and
travelled
leisurely
from
town
to
town
preaching
as
i
went
and
wherever
circumstances
were
favorable
soliciting
aid
in
my
great
object
i
succeeded
so
well
that
when
i
arrived
at
montgomery
county
i
was
master
of
two
hundred
and
dollars
besides
my
horse
and
my
clothes
my
master
was
surprised
to
see
me
dressed
and
mounted
in
so
respectable
a
style
and
i
must
say
my
horse
was
a
good
one
and
my
clothes
better
than
s
and
he
was
a
little
puzzled
to
understand
why
i
was
so
long
in
reaching
home
for
it
was
now
christmas
and
he
had
been
informed
that
i
had
left
kentucky
in
september
i
gave
him
such
an
account
of
my
preaching
and
getting
the
assistance
of
friends
as
while
it
was
consistent
with
the
truth
and
explained
my
appearance
did
not
betray
to
him
my
principal
purpose
amid
expressions
of
an
apparently
cordial
welcome
i
could
discern
plainly
enough
the
look
of
displeasure
that
a
slave
should
have
got
possession
of
such
luxuries
and
he
bantered
me
not
a
little
in
his
coarse
way
upon
my
preaching
and
my
being
so
speedily
converted
into
a
black
he
asked
for
my
pass
and
saw
that
it
was
expressed
so
as
to
authorize
my
return
to
kentucky
he
then
handed
it
to
his
wife
and
desired
her
to
put
it
into
the
desk
the
manœuvre
was
cool
but
i
resolved
to
manœuvre
too
at
night
i
was
sent
to
such
quarters
as
i
had
been
accustomed
to
long
enough
the
cabin
used
for
a
kitchen
with
its
earth
floor
its
filth
and
its
numerous
occupants
but
it
was
so
different
from
my
accommodations
in
the
free
states
for
the
last
three
months
and
so
incompatible
with
my
nice
wardrobe
that
i
looked
round
me
with
a
sensation
of
disgust
that
was
new
to
me
and
instead
of
going
to
sleep
i
sat
down
and
deliberated
upon
the
best
plan
to
adopt
for
my
next
proceedings
i
found
my
mother
had
died
during
my
absence
and
every
tie
which
had
ever
connected
me
with
this
place
was
broken
strangers
were
around
me
here
the
slaves
being
those
had
brought
to
her
husband
and
i
had
not
a
friend
to
consult
but
master
frank
the
brother
of
s
wife
before
mentioned
who
was
now
of
age
and
had
established
himself
in
business
in
washington
to
him
i
resolved
to
go
and
as
soon
as
i
thought
it
time
to
start
i
saddled
my
horse
and
rode
up
to
the
house
it
was
early
in
the
morning
and
my
master
had
already
gone
to
the
tavern
on
his
usual
business
but
came
out
to
look
at
my
horse
and
equipments
where
are
you
going
siah
was
the
natural
question
i
replied
i
am
going
to
washington
mistress
to
see
frank
and
i
must
take
my
pass
with
me
if
you
o
everybody
knows
you
here
you
won
t
need
your
but
i
can
t
go
to
washington
without
it
i
may
be
met
by
some
surly
stranger
who
will
stop
me
and
plague
me
if
he
can
t
do
any
thing
well
i
ll
get
it
for
you
she
answered
and
glad
was
i
to
see
her
return
with
it
in
her
hand
and
to
have
her
give
it
to
me
while
she
little
imagined
its
importance
to
my
plan
my
reception
by
master
frank
was
all
i
expected
as
kind
and
hearty
as
possible
he
was
delighted
at
my
appearance
and
i
immediately
told
him
all
my
plans
and
hopes
he
entered
cordially
into
them
with
that
sympathy
which
penetrates
the
heart
of
a
slave
as
little
accustomed
as
i
had
been
to
the
exhibition
of
any
such
feeling
on
the
part
of
a
white
man
i
found
he
had
a
thorough
detestation
of
whom
he
charged
with
having
defrauded
him
of
a
large
proportion
of
his
property
which
he
had
held
as
guardian
though
as
he
was
still
on
terms
with
him
he
readily
agreed
to
negotiate
for
my
freedom
and
bring
him
to
the
most
favorable
bargain
accordingly
in
a
few
days
he
rode
over
to
the
house
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
on
the
subject
of
my
emancipation
he
disclosed
to
him
the
facts
that
i
had
got
some
money
and
and
urged
that
i
was
a
smart
fellow
who
was
bent
upon
getting
his
freedom
and
had
served
the
family
faithfully
for
many
years
that
i
had
really
paid
for
myself
a
hundred
times
over
in
the
increased
amount
of
produce
i
had
raised
by
my
skill
and
influence
and
that
if
he
did
not
take
care
and
accept
a
fair
offer
when
i
made
it
to
him
he
would
find
some
day
that
i
had
the
means
to
do
without
his
help
and
that
he
would
see
neither
me
nor
my
money
that
with
my
horse
and
my
pass
i
was
pretty
independent
of
him
already
and
he
had
better
make
up
his
mind
to
what
was
really
inevitable
and
do
it
with
a
good
grace
by
such
arguments
as
these
frank
not
only
induced
him
to
think
of
the
thing
but
before
long
brought
him
to
an
actual
bargain
by
which
he
agreed
to
give
me
my
manumission
papers
for
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
of
which
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
were
to
be
in
cash
and
the
remainder
in
my
note
my
money
and
my
horse
enabled
me
to
pay
the
cash
at
once
and
thus
my
great
hopes
seemed
in
a
fair
way
of
being
realized
some
time
was
spent
in
the
negotiations
for
this
affair
and
it
was
not
till
the
of
march
that
i
received
my
manumission
papers
in
due
form
of
law
i
was
prepared
to
start
immediately
on
my
return
to
kentucky
and
on
the
as
i
was
getting
ready
in
the
morning
for
my
journey
my
master
accosted
me
in
a
very
pleasant
and
friendly
manner
and
entered
into
conversation
with
me
about
my
plans
he
asked
me
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
my
freedom
certificate
whether
i
was
going
to
show
it
if
i
were
questioned
on
the
road
i
told
him
yes
that
i
supposed
it
was
given
to
me
for
that
very
purpose
ah
said
he
you
do
not
understand
the
dangers
to
which
you
are
exposed
you
may
meet
with
some
ruffian
who
will
rob
you
of
that
piece
of
paper
and
destroy
it
you
will
then
be
thrown
into
prison
and
sold
for
your
jail
fees
before
any
of
your
friends
can
know
it
why
should
you
show
it
at
all
you
can
go
to
kentucky
in
perfect
safety
with
your
pass
let
me
enclose
that
valuable
document
for
you
under
cover
to
my
brother
and
nobody
will
dare
to
break
a
seal
for
that
is
a
state
prison
matter
and
when
you
arrive
in
kentucky
you
will
have
it
all
safe
and
this
seemed
most
friendly
advice
and
i
felt
very
grateful
for
his
kindness
i
accordingly
saw
him
enclose
my
precious
piece
of
paper
in
two
or
three
envelopes
seal
it
with
three
seals
and
direct
it
to
his
brother
in
daviess
county
kentucky
in
my
care
leaving
immediately
for
wheeling
to
which
place
i
was
obliged
to
travel
on
foot
i
there
took
boat
and
in
due
time
reached
my
destination
i
was
arrested
repeatedly
on
the
way
but
by
insisting
always
upon
being
carried
before
a
magistrate
i
succeeded
in
escaping
all
serious
impediments
by
means
of
my
pass
which
was
quite
regular
and
could
not
be
set
aside
by
any
responsible
authority
it
so
happened
that
the
boat
which
took
me
down
from
louisville
landed
me
about
dark
and
my
walk
of
five
miles
brought
me
to
the
plantation
at
i
went
directly
to
my
own
cabin
where
i
found
my
wife
and
little
ones
well
and
of
course
we
had
a
good
deal
to
communicate
to
each
other
letters
had
reached
the
great
house
as
the
master
s
was
always
called
long
before
i
had
arrived
telling
them
what
i
had
been
doing
and
the
children
of
the
family
had
been
eager
to
communicate
the
great
news
to
my
wife
how
i
had
been
preaching
and
raising
money
and
making
a
bargain
for
my
freedom
it
was
not
long
before
charlotte
began
to
tell
me
with
much
excitement
what
she
had
heard
and
to
question
me
about
how
i
had
raised
the
money
i
had
paid
and
how
i
expected
to
get
the
remainder
of
the
i
was
to
give
for
my
freedom
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
ears
but
before
telling
her
how
the
case
exactly
was
i
questioned
her
again
and
again
as
to
what
she
had
heard
she
persisted
in
repeating
the
same
story
as
she
had
heard
it
from
my
master
s
letters
and
i
began
to
perceive
the
trick
that
had
been
played
upon
me
and
to
see
the
management
by
which
isaac
had
contrived
that
the
only
evidence
of
my
freedom
should
be
kept
from
every
eye
but
that
of
his
brother
amos
who
was
instructed
to
retain
it
till
i
had
made
up
six
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
the
balance
i
was
reported
to
have
agreed
to
pay
indignation
is
a
faint
word
to
express
my
deep
sense
of
such
villainy
i
was
without
the
means
of
setting
myself
right
the
only
witness
to
the
truth
was
my
friend
frank
who
was
a
thousand
miles
off
and
i
could
neither
write
to
him
nor
get
any
one
else
to
do
it
every
man
about
me
who
could
write
was
a
slaveholder
and
what
chance
had
i
to
be
believed
or
to
get
evidence
to
the
truth
in
this
dilemma
i
resolved
not
to
deliver
the
paper
to
amos
and
told
my
wife
i
had
not
seen
it
since
i
was
in
louisville
it
might
be
in
my
bag
and
perhaps
it
was
lost
but
at
all
events
i
did
not
wish
to
see
it
again
at
present
and
if
she
should
find
it
and
put
it
in
some
place
which
i
did
not
know
it
would
be
the
best
disposition
of
it
in
a
few
minutes
she
went
out
and
i
remained
in
ignorance
where
it
was
till
circumstances
presently
to
be
mentioned
rendered
it
necessary
for
me
to
have
it
again
the
next
morning
i
went
up
to
the
house
and
showed
myself
to
amos
who
welcomed
me
with
apparent
cordiality
and
who
i
have
no
doubt
was
really
glad
to
see
me
as
my
time
and
labor
were
important
to
him
we
had
a
long
conversation
and
after
rallying
me
as
his
brother
had
done
about
my
being
turned
fine
gentleman
he
entered
upon
the
subject
of
my
freedom
and
told
me
what
isaac
had
written
to
him
about
the
price
i
was
to
pay
how
much
i
had
already
made
up
i
found
my
wife
was
right
he
then
asked
me
if
i
had
not
a
paper
for
him
i
told
him
i
certainly
had
received
something
for
him
of
which
i
had
taken
the
greatest
care
but
that
the
last
time
i
had
seen
it
was
at
louisville
and
that
now
it
was
not
in
my
bag
and
i
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
it
i
could
not
conceive
how
it
could
be
lost
and
yet
i
could
not
find
it
he
expressed
great
concern
and
sent
me
back
to
the
landing
to
see
if
it
had
been
dropped
on
the
way
when
the
search
proved
in
vain
he
told
me
that
after
all
it
was
of
no
consequence
for
whenever
i
made
up
the
money
his
brother
would
renew
the
paper
but
said
he
you
have
given
too
much
for
yourself
isaac
has
been
too
hard
upon
you
and
i
don
t
see
how
you
are
going
to
get
so
much
in
all
this
was
very
smooth
and
pleasant
to
a
man
who
was
in
a
frenzy
of
grief
at
the
base
and
apparently
irremediable
trick
that
had
been
played
upon
him
i
consoled
myself
as
well
as
i
could
and
set
about
my
work
again
with
as
quiet
a
mind
as
i
could
command
resolved
to
trust
in
god
and
never
despair
things
went
on
as
usual
for
about
a
year
when
one
day
amos
told
me
that
his
brother
kept
writing
to
him
about
his
want
of
money
and
intimated
that
perhaps
i
might
be
ready
to
pay
another
instalment
of
my
price
i
told
him
i
had
nothing
as
he
knew
very
well
and
that
he
never
had
said
what
he
would
allow
me
or
whether
he
would
allow
me
anything
for
my
labor
in
his
service
that
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
at
the
time
for
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
paying
for
the
labor
i
had
bestowed
on
his
farm
the
care
of
his
stock
and
of
his
people
it
was
not
long
however
before
the
subject
was
brought
up
again
and
he
said
isaac
was
perpetually
telling
him
he
must
have
money
and
added
that
i
must
get
ready
to
go
to
new
orleans
with
his
son
amos
a
young
man
about
years
of
age
who
was
going
down
the
river
with
a
flat
boat
and
was
nearly
ready
to
start
in
fact
he
was
to
leave
the
next
day
and
i
must
go
and
take
care
of
him
and
help
him
dispose
of
the
cargo
the
intimation
was
enough
though
it
was
not
distinctly
stated
yet
i
well
knew
what
was
intended
and
my
heart
sunk
within
me
at
the
near
prospect
of
this
fatal
blight
to
all
my
hopes
there
was
no
alternative
but
death
itself
and
i
thought
that
there
was
hope
as
long
as
there
was
life
and
i
would
not
despair
even
yet
the
expectation
of
my
fate
however
produced
the
degree
of
misery
nearest
to
that
of
despair
and
it
is
in
vain
for
me
to
attempt
to
describe
the
wretchedness
i
experienced
as
i
made
ready
to
go
on
board
the
flat
boat
i
had
little
preparation
to
make
to
be
sure
and
there
was
but
one
thing
that
seemed
to
me
important
i
asked
my
wife
to
sew
up
my
manumission
paper
securely
in
a
piece
of
cloth
and
to
sew
that
again
round
my
person
i
thought
that
having
possession
of
it
might
be
the
means
of
saving
me
yet
and
i
would
not
neglect
any
thing
that
offered
the
smallest
chance
of
escape
from
the
frightful
servitude
that
threatened
me
my
wife
and
children
accompanied
me
to
the
landing
where
i
bade
them
an
adieu
which
might
be
for
life
and
then
stepped
into
the
boat
which
i
found
manned
by
three
white
men
who
had
been
hired
for
the
trip
amos
and
myself
were
the
only
other
persons
on
board
the
load
consisted
of
pigs
poultry
corn
whiskey
and
other
articles
from
the
farm
and
from
some
of
the
neighboring
estates
which
were
to
be
sold
as
we
dropped
down
the
river
wherever
they
could
be
disposed
of
to
the
greatest
advantage
it
was
a
common
trading
voyage
to
new
orleans
in
which
i
was
embarked
the
interest
of
which
consisted
not
in
the
incidents
that
occurred
not
in
storms
or
shipwreck
or
external
disaster
of
any
sort
but
in
the
storm
of
passions
contending
within
me
and
the
imminent
risk
of
the
shipwreck
of
my
soul
which
was
impending
over
me
nearly
the
whole
period
of
the
voyage
one
circumstance
only
i
will
mention
illustrating
as
other
events
of
my
life
have
often
done
the
counsel
of
the
saviour
he
that
will
be
chief
among
you
let
him
be
your
we
were
of
course
all
bound
to
take
our
trick
at
the
helm
in
turn
sometimes
under
direction
of
the
captain
and
sometimes
on
our
own
responsibility
as
he
could
not
be
always
awake
in
the
daytime
there
was
less
difficulty
than
at
night
when
it
required
some
one
who
knew
the
river
to
avoid
and
snags
and
the
captain
was
the
only
person
on
board
who
had
this
knowledge
but
whether
by
day
or
by
night
as
i
was
the
only
negro
on
the
boat
i
was
made
to
stand
at
least
three
tricks
to
any
other
person
s
one
so
that
from
being
much
with
the
captain
and
frequently
thrown
upon
my
own
exertions
i
learnt
the
art
of
steering
and
managing
the
boat
far
better
than
the
rest
i
watched
the
manœuvres
necessary
to
shoot
by
a
sawyer
to
land
on
a
bank
or
avoid
a
snag
or
a
steamboat
in
the
rapid
current
of
the
mississippi
till
i
could
do
it
as
well
as
the
captain
after
a
while
the
captain
had
a
disease
of
the
eyes
by
which
they
became
very
much
inflamed
and
swollen
he
was
soon
rendered
totally
blind
and
unable
to
perform
his
share
of
duty
this
disorder
is
not
an
infrequent
consequence
of
exposure
to
the
intense
light
of
the
sun
doubled
as
it
is
by
the
reflection
from
the
river
i
was
the
person
who
could
best
take
his
place
and
i
was
in
fact
master
of
the
boat
from
that
time
till
our
arrival
at
new
orleans
after
the
captain
became
blind
we
were
obliged
to
lie
by
at
night
as
none
of
the
rest
of
us
had
been
down
the
river
before
and
it
was
necessary
to
keep
watch
all
night
to
prevent
depredations
by
the
negroes
on
shore
who
used
frequently
to
attack
such
boats
as
ours
for
the
sake
of
the
provisions
on
board
as
i
paced
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
deck
during
my
watch
it
may
well
be
believed
i
revolved
many
a
painful
and
passionate
thought
after
all
that
i
had
done
for
isaac
and
amos
after
all
the
regard
they
professed
for
me
and
the
value
they
could
not
but
put
upon
me
such
a
return
as
this
for
my
services
such
an
evidence
of
their
utter
inattention
to
my
claims
upon
them
and
the
intense
selfishness
with
which
they
were
ready
to
sacrifice
me
at
any
moment
to
their
supposed
interest
turned
my
blood
to
gall
and
wormwood
and
changed
me
from
a
lively
and
i
will
say
a
fellow
into
a
savage
morose
dangerous
slave
i
was
going
not
at
all
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
but
i
felt
myself
becoming
more
ferocious
every
day
and
as
we
approached
the
place
where
this
iniquity
was
to
be
consummated
i
became
more
and
more
agitated
with
an
almost
uncontrollable
fury
i
had
met
on
the
passage
with
some
of
my
maryland
acquaintance
who
had
been
sold
off
to
this
region
and
their
haggard
and
wasted
appearance
told
a
piteous
story
of
excessive
labor
and
insufficient
food
i
said
to
myself
if
this
is
to
be
my
lot
i
can
not
survive
it
long
i
am
not
so
young
as
these
men
and
if
it
has
brought
them
to
such
a
condition
it
will
soon
kill
me
i
am
to
be
taken
by
my
masters
and
owners
who
ought
to
be
my
grateful
friends
to
a
place
and
a
condition
where
my
life
is
to
be
shortened
as
well
as
made
more
wretched
why
should
i
not
prevent
this
wrong
if
i
can
by
shortening
their
lives
or
those
of
their
agents
in
accomplishing
such
detestable
injustice
i
can
do
the
last
easily
enough
they
have
no
suspicion
of
me
and
they
are
at
this
moment
under
my
control
and
in
my
power
there
are
many
ways
in
which
i
can
despatch
them
and
escape
and
i
feel
that
i
should
be
justified
in
availing
myself
of
the
first
good
these
were
not
thoughts
which
just
flitted
across
my
mind
s
eye
and
then
disappeared
they
fashioned
themselves
into
shapes
which
grew
larger
and
seemed
firmer
every
time
they
presented
themselves
and
at
length
my
mind
was
made
up
to
convert
the
phantom
shadow
into
a
positive
reality
i
resolved
to
kill
my
four
companions
take
what
money
there
was
in
the
boat
then
to
scuttle
the
craft
and
escape
to
the
north
it
was
a
poor
plan
and
would
very
likely
have
failed
but
it
was
as
well
contrived
under
the
circumstances
as
the
plans
of
murderers
usually
are
and
blinded
by
passion
and
stung
to
madness
as
i
was
i
could
not
see
any
difficulty
about
it
one
dark
rainy
night
within
a
few
days
of
new
orleans
my
hour
seemed
to
have
come
i
was
alone
on
the
deck
amos
and
the
hands
were
all
asleep
below
and
i
crept
down
noiselessly
got
hold
of
an
axe
entered
the
cabin
and
looking
by
the
aid
of
the
dim
light
there
for
my
victims
my
eye
fell
upon
master
amos
who
was
nearest
to
me
my
hand
slid
along
the
i
raised
it
to
strike
the
fatal
blow
when
suddenly
the
thought
came
to
me
what
commit
and
you
a
christian
i
had
not
called
it
murder
before
it
was
it
was
preventing
others
from
murdering
me
it
was
justifiable
it
was
even
praiseworthy
but
now
all
at
once
the
truth
burst
upon
me
that
it
was
a
crime
i
was
going
to
kill
a
young
man
who
had
done
nothing
to
injure
me
but
obey
commands
which
he
could
not
resist
i
was
about
to
lose
the
fruit
of
all
my
efforts
at
the
character
i
had
acquired
and
the
peace
of
mind
which
had
never
deserted
me
ah
this
came
upon
me
instantly
and
with
a
distinctness
which
made
me
almost
think
i
heard
it
whispered
in
my
ear
and
i
believe
i
even
turned
my
head
to
listen
i
shrunk
back
laid
down
the
axe
crept
up
on
deck
again
and
thanked
god
as
i
have
done
every
day
since
that
i
had
not
committed
murder
my
feelings
were
still
agitated
but
they
were
changed
i
was
filled
with
shame
and
remorse
for
the
design
i
had
entertained
and
with
the
fear
that
my
companions
would
detect
it
in
my
face
or
that
a
careless
word
would
betray
my
guilty
thoughts
i
remained
on
deck
all
night
instead
of
rousing
one
of
the
men
to
relieve
me
and
nothing
brought
composure
to
my
mind
but
the
solemn
resolution
i
then
made
to
resign
myself
to
the
will
of
god
and
take
with
thankfulness
if
i
could
but
with
submission
at
all
events
whatever
he
might
decide
should
be
my
lot
i
reflected
that
if
my
life
were
reduced
to
a
brief
term
i
should
have
less
to
suffer
and
that
it
was
better
to
die
with
a
christian
s
hope
and
a
quiet
conscience
than
to
live
with
the
incessant
recollection
of
a
crime
that
would
destroy
the
value
of
life
and
under
the
weight
of
a
secret
that
would
crush
out
the
satisfaction
that
might
be
expected
from
freedom
and
every
other
blessing
it
was
long
before
i
recovered
my
and
serenity
but
i
believe
no
one
but
those
to
whom
i
have
told
the
story
myself
ever
suspected
me
of
having
entertained
such
thoughts
for
a
moment
in
a
few
days
after
this
tremendous
crisis
we
arrived
in
new
orleans
and
the
little
that
remained
of
our
cargo
was
soon
sold
the
men
were
discharged
and
nothing
was
left
but
to
dispose
of
me
and
break
up
the
boat
and
then
amos
would
take
passage
on
a
steamboat
and
go
home
there
was
no
longer
any
disguise
about
the
purpose
of
selling
me
amos
acknowledged
that
such
were
his
instructions
and
he
set
about
fulfilling
them
several
planters
came
to
the
boat
to
look
at
me
and
i
was
sent
of
some
hasty
errand
that
they
might
see
how
i
could
run
my
points
were
canvassed
as
those
of
a
horse
would
have
been
and
doubtless
some
account
of
my
human
faculties
was
thrown
into
the
discussion
of
the
bargain
that
my
value
as
a
domestic
animal
might
be
enhanced
amos
had
talked
with
apparent
kindness
about
getting
me
a
good
master
who
would
employ
me
as
a
coachman
or
as
a
but
as
time
passed
on
i
could
discern
no
particular
effort
of
the
kind
at
length
every
thing
was
wound
up
but
this
single
affair
the
boat
was
to
be
sold
and
i
was
to
be
sold
the
next
day
and
amos
was
to
set
off
on
his
return
at
six
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
i
could
not
sleep
that
night
which
seemed
long
enough
to
me
though
it
was
one
of
the
shortest
in
the
year
the
slow
way
in
which
we
had
come
down
had
brought
us
to
the
long
days
and
the
heat
of
june
and
everybody
knows
what
the
climate
of
new
orleans
is
at
that
time
of
the
year
a
little
before
daylight
master
amos
awoke
indisposed
his
stomach
was
disordered
but
he
lay
down
again
thinking
it
would
pass
off
in
a
little
while
he
was
up
again
and
felt
more
sick
than
before
and
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
river
fever
was
upon
him
he
became
rapidly
worse
and
by
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
was
utterly
prostrate
his
head
was
on
my
lap
and
he
was
begging
me
to
help
him
to
do
something
for
him
to
save
him
the
tables
were
turned
he
was
now
rather
more
dependent
upon
me
than
i
had
been
upon
him
the
day
before
he
entreated
me
to
despatch
matters
to
sell
the
flat
boat
in
which
we
two
had
been
living
by
ourselves
for
some
days
and
to
get
him
and
his
trunk
containing
the
proceeds
of
the
trip
on
board
the
steamer
as
quick
as
possible
and
especially
not
to
desert
him
so
long
as
he
lived
nor
to
suffer
his
body
if
he
died
to
be
thrown
into
the
river
i
attended
to
all
his
requests
and
by
twelve
o
clock
that
day
he
was
in
one
of
the
cabins
of
the
steamer
appropriated
to
sick
passengers
all
was
done
which
could
be
done
for
the
comfort
and
relief
of
any
one
in
such
a
desperate
condition
but
he
was
reduced
to
extremity
he
ceased
to
grow
worse
after
a
day
or
two
and
he
must
speedily
have
died
if
he
had
not
but
his
strength
was
so
entirely
gone
that
he
could
neither
speak
nor
move
a
limb
and
could
only
indicate
his
wish
for
a
teaspoonful
of
gruel
or
something
to
moisten
his
throat
by
a
feeble
motion
of
his
lips
i
nursed
him
carefully
and
constantly
nothing
else
could
have
saved
his
life
it
hung
by
a
thread
for
a
long
time
we
were
as
much
as
twelve
days
in
reaching
home
for
the
water
was
low
at
that
season
particularly
in
the
ohio
river
and
when
we
arrived
at
our
landing
he
was
still
unable
to
speak
and
could
only
be
moved
on
a
sheet
or
a
litter
something
of
this
sort
was
soon
fixed
up
at
the
landing
on
which
he
could
be
carried
to
the
house
which
was
five
miles
off
and
i
got
a
party
of
the
slaves
belonging
to
the
estate
to
form
relays
for
the
purpose
as
we
approached
the
house
the
surprise
at
seeing
me
back
again
and
the
perplexity
to
imagine
what
i
was
bringing
along
with
such
a
party
were
extreme
but
the
discovery
was
soon
made
which
explained
the
strange
appearance
and
the
grief
of
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
made
itself
seen
and
heard
loud
and
long
were
the
lamentations
over
poor
amos
and
when
the
family
came
a
little
to
themselves
great
were
the
commendations
bestowed
upon
me
for
my
care
of
him
and
of
the
property
we
arrived
home
about
the
tenth
of
july
but
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
august
that
amos
was
well
enough
to
move
out
of
his
chamber
though
he
had
been
convalescent
all
the
while
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
he
told
all
i
had
done
for
him
and
said
if
i
had
sold
him
i
should
have
died
but
it
never
seemed
to
occur
to
him
or
the
rest
of
the
family
that
they
were
under
any
the
slightest
obligation
to
me
on
that
account
i
had
done
well
as
a
slave
and
to
have
it
acknowledged
and
to
be
praised
for
it
was
compensation
enough
for
me
my
merits
whatever
they
were
instead
of
exciting
sympathy
or
any
feeling
of
attachment
to
me
seemed
only
to
enhance
my
money
value
to
them
this
was
not
the
view
which
i
took
of
the
case
myself
and
as
soon
as
amos
began
to
recover
i
began
to
meditate
upon
a
plan
of
escape
from
the
danger
in
which
i
constantly
stood
of
a
repetition
of
the
attempt
to
sell
me
in
the
highest
market
providence
seemed
to
have
interfered
once
to
defeat
the
scheme
but
i
could
not
expect
such
extraordinary
circumstances
to
be
repeated
and
i
was
bound
to
do
every
thing
in
my
power
to
secure
myself
and
my
family
from
the
wicked
conspiracy
of
isaac
and
amos
against
my
life
as
well
as
against
my
natural
rights
in
my
own
person
and
those
which
i
had
acquired
under
even
the
barbarous
laws
of
slavery
by
the
money
i
had
paid
for
myself
if
isaac
would
only
have
been
honest
enough
to
adhere
to
his
own
bargain
i
would
have
adhered
to
mine
and
paid
him
all
i
had
promised
but
his
attempt
to
kidnap
me
again
after
having
pocketed
of
my
market
value
absolved
me
from
all
obligation
in
my
opinion
to
pay
him
any
more
or
to
continue
in
a
position
which
exposed
me
to
his
machinations
i
determined
to
make
my
escape
to
canada
about
which
i
had
heard
something
as
beyond
the
limits
of
the
united
states
for
notwithstanding
there
were
free
states
in
the
union
i
felt
that
i
should
be
safer
under
an
entirely
foreign
jurisdiction
the
slave
states
had
their
emissaries
in
the
others
and
i
feared
that
i
might
fall
into
their
hands
and
need
a
stronger
protection
than
might
be
afforded
me
by
public
opinion
in
the
northern
states
at
that
time
it
was
not
without
long
thought
on
the
subject
that
i
devised
a
plan
of
escape
but
when
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
i
communicated
my
intention
to
my
wife
who
was
too
much
terrified
by
the
dangers
of
the
attempt
to
do
any
thing
at
first
but
endeavor
to
dissuade
me
from
it
and
try
to
make
me
contented
with
my
condition
as
it
was
in
vain
i
explained
to
her
the
liability
we
were
in
of
being
separated
from
our
children
as
well
as
from
each
other
and
presented
every
argument
which
had
weighed
with
my
own
mind
and
had
at
last
decided
me
she
had
not
gone
through
my
trials
and
female
timidity
overcame
her
sense
of
the
evils
she
had
experienced
i
argued
the
matter
with
her
at
various
times
till
i
was
satisfied
that
argument
alone
would
not
prevail
and
then
i
said
to
her
very
deliberately
that
though
it
was
a
cruel
thing
for
me
to
part
with
her
yet
i
would
do
it
and
take
all
the
children
with
me
but
the
youngest
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
forcible
separation
from
them
all
and
of
a
much
worse
captivity
besides
which
we
were
constantly
exposed
to
here
she
wept
and
entreated
but
found
i
was
resolute
and
after
a
whole
night
spent
in
talking
over
the
matter
i
left
her
to
go
to
my
work
for
the
day
i
had
not
gone
far
when
i
heard
her
voice
calling
me
i
waited
till
she
came
up
to
me
and
then
finding
me
as
determined
as
ever
she
said
at
last
she
would
go
with
me
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
my
nerves
and
my
tears
flowed
as
fast
as
hers
had
done
before
i
rode
off
with
a
heart
a
good
deal
lighter
she
was
living
at
the
time
near
the
landing
i
have
mentioned
for
the
plantation
extended
the
whole
five
miles
from
the
house
to
the
river
and
there
were
several
different
farms
all
of
which
i
was
overseeing
and
therefore
riding
about
from
one
to
another
every
day
the
oldest
boy
was
at
the
house
with
master
amos
the
rest
were
all
with
her
her
consent
was
given
on
thursday
morning
and
on
the
night
of
the
following
saturday
i
had
decided
to
set
out
as
it
would
then
be
several
days
before
i
should
be
missed
and
i
should
get
a
good
start
some
time
previously
i
had
got
my
wife
to
make
me
a
large
knapsack
big
enough
to
hold
the
two
smallest
children
and
i
had
arranged
it
that
she
should
lead
the
second
boy
while
the
oldest
was
stout
enough
to
go
by
himself
and
to
help
me
carry
the
necessary
food
i
used
to
pack
the
little
ones
on
my
back
of
an
evening
after
i
had
got
through
my
day
s
work
and
trot
round
the
cabin
with
them
and
go
some
little
distance
from
it
in
order
to
accustom
both
them
and
myself
to
the
task
before
us
at
length
the
eventful
night
came
i
went
up
to
the
house
to
ask
leave
to
take
tom
home
with
me
that
he
might
have
his
clothes
mended
no
objection
was
made
and
i
bade
master
amos
goodnight
for
the
last
time
it
was
about
the
middle
of
september
and
by
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
all
was
ready
it
was
a
dark
moonless
night
and
we
got
into
the
little
skiff
in
which
i
had
induced
a
to
take
us
across
the
river
it
was
an
agitating
and
solemn
moment
the
good
fellow
who
was
rowing
us
over
said
this
affair
might
end
in
his
death
but
said
he
you
will
not
be
brought
back
alive
will
you
not
if
i
can
help
it
i
answered
and
if
you
are
overpowered
and
return
he
asked
will
you
conceal
my
part
of
the
business
that
i
will
so
help
me
god
i
replied
then
i
am
easy
he
answered
and
wish
you
we
landed
on
the
indiana
shore
and
i
began
to
feel
that
i
was
my
own
master
but
in
what
circumstances
of
fear
and
misery
still
we
were
to
travel
by
night
and
rest
by
day
in
the
woods
and
bushes
we
were
thrown
absolutely
upon
our
own
poor
and
small
resources
and
were
to
rely
on
our
own
strength
alone
the
population
was
not
so
numerous
as
now
nor
so
well
disposed
to
the
slave
we
dared
look
to
no
one
for
help
but
my
courage
was
equal
to
the
occasion
and
we
trudged
on
cautiously
and
steadily
and
as
fast
as
the
darkness
and
the
feebleness
of
my
wife
and
boys
would
allow
it
was
nearly
a
fortnight
before
we
reached
cincinnati
and
a
day
or
two
previous
to
getting
there
our
provisions
were
used
up
and
i
had
the
misery
to
hear
the
cry
of
hunger
and
exhaustion
from
those
i
loved
so
dearly
it
was
necessary
to
run
the
risk
of
exposure
by
upon
the
road
so
i
sprung
upon
it
boldly
from
our
hiding
place
one
morning
and
turned
towards
the
south
to
prevent
the
suspicion
of
my
going
the
other
way
i
approached
the
first
house
i
saw
and
asked
if
they
would
sell
me
a
little
bread
and
meat
no
they
had
nothing
for
black
fellows
at
the
next
i
succeeded
better
but
had
to
make
as
good
a
bargain
as
i
could
and
that
was
not
very
successful
with
a
man
who
wanted
to
see
how
little
he
could
give
me
for
my
quarter
of
a
dollar
as
soon
as
i
had
succeeded
in
making
a
purchase
i
followed
the
road
still
towards
the
south
till
i
got
out
of
sight
of
the
house
and
then
darted
into
the
woods
again
and
returned
northward
just
out
of
sight
of
the
road
the
food
which
i
bought
such
as
it
was
put
new
life
and
strength
into
my
wife
and
children
when
i
got
back
to
them
again
and
we
at
length
arrived
safe
at
cincinnati
there
we
were
kindly
received
and
entertained
for
several
days
my
wife
and
little
ones
were
refreshed
and
then
we
were
carried
on
our
way
thirty
miles
in
a
wagon
we
followed
the
same
course
as
before
of
travelling
by
night
and
resting
by
day
till
we
arrived
at
the
scioto
where
we
had
been
told
we
should
strike
the
military
road
of
general
hull
in
the
last
war
with
great
britain
and
might
then
safely
travel
by
day
we
found
the
road
accordingly
by
the
large
sycamore
and
elm
which
marked
its
beginning
and
entered
upon
it
with
fresh
spirits
early
in
the
day
nobody
had
told
us
that
it
was
cut
through
the
wilderness
and
i
had
neglected
to
provide
any
food
thinking
we
should
soon
come
to
some
habitation
where
we
could
be
supplied
but
we
travelled
on
all
day
without
seeing
one
and
laid
down
at
night
hungry
and
weary
enough
i
thought
i
heard
the
howling
of
wolves
and
the
terror
inspired
by
this
and
the
exertions
i
used
to
keep
them
off
by
making
as
much
noise
as
i
could
took
away
all
power
of
sleeping
till
daylight
and
rendered
a
little
delay
inevitable
in
the
morning
we
were
as
hungry
as
ever
but
had
nothing
to
relieve
our
appetites
but
a
little
piece
of
dried
beef
i
divided
some
of
this
all
round
and
then
started
for
a
second
day
s
trip
in
the
wilderness
it
was
a
hard
trial
and
this
day
is
a
memorable
one
in
my
life
the
road
was
rough
of
course
being
neglected
and
the
logs
lying
across
it
constantly
the
underbrush
was
somewhat
cleared
away
and
that
was
about
all
to
mark
the
track
as
we
went
wearily
on
i
was
a
little
ahead
of
my
wife
and
the
boys
when
i
heard
them
call
to
me
and
turning
round
saw
that
my
wife
had
fallen
over
a
log
and
was
prostrate
on
the
ground
mother
s
dying
cried
tom
and
when
i
reached
her
it
seemed
really
so
she
had
fainted
i
did
not
know
but
it
might
be
fatal
and
was
half
distracted
with
the
fear
and
the
uncertainty
in
a
few
minutes
however
she
recovered
sufficiently
to
take
a
few
mouthfuls
of
the
beef
and
this
with
a
little
rest
revived
her
so
much
that
she
bravely
set
out
once
more
we
had
not
gone
far
and
i
suppose
it
was
about
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
when
we
discerned
some
persons
approaching
us
at
no
great
distance
we
were
instantly
on
the
alert
as
we
could
hardly
expect
them
to
be
friends
the
advance
of
a
few
paces
showed
me
they
were
indians
with
packs
on
their
shoulders
and
they
were
so
near
that
if
they
were
hostile
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
escape
so
i
walked
along
boldly
till
we
came
close
upon
them
they
were
bent
down
with
their
burdens
and
had
not
raised
their
eyes
till
now
and
when
they
did
so
and
saw
me
coming
towards
them
they
looked
at
me
in
a
frightened
sort
of
way
for
a
moment
and
then
setting
up
a
peculiar
howl
turned
round
and
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
there
were
three
or
four
of
them
and
what
they
were
afraid
of
i
could
not
imagine
unless
they
supposed
i
was
the
devil
whom
they
had
perhaps
heard
of
as
black
but
even
then
one
would
have
thought
my
wife
and
children
might
have
reassured
them
however
there
was
no
doubt
they
were
well
frightened
and
we
heard
their
wild
and
prolonged
howl
as
they
ran
for
a
mile
or
more
my
wife
was
alarmed
too
and
thought
they
were
merely
running
back
to
collect
more
of
a
party
and
then
to
come
and
murder
us
and
she
wanted
to
turn
back
i
told
her
they
were
numerous
enough
to
do
that
if
they
wanted
to
without
help
and
that
as
for
turning
back
i
had
had
quite
too
much
of
the
road
behind
us
and
that
it
would
be
a
ridiculous
thing
that
both
parties
should
run
away
if
they
were
disposed
to
run
i
would
follow
we
did
follow
on
and
soon
the
noise
was
stopped
and
as
we
advanced
we
could
discover
indians
peeping
at
us
from
behind
the
trees
and
dodging
out
of
our
sight
if
they
thought
we
were
looking
at
them
presently
we
came
upon
their
wigwams
and
saw
a
fine
looking
stately
indian
with
his
arms
folded
waiting
for
us
to
approach
he
was
apparently
the
chief
and
saluting
us
civilly
he
soon
discovered
that
we
were
human
beings
and
spoke
to
his
young
men
who
were
scattered
about
and
made
them
come
in
and
give
up
their
foolish
fears
and
now
curiosity
seemed
to
prevail
each
one
wanted
to
touch
the
children
who
were
shy
as
partridges
with
their
long
life
in
the
woods
and
as
they
shrunk
away
and
uttered
a
little
cry
of
alarm
the
indian
would
jump
back
too
as
if
he
thought
they
would
bite
him
however
a
little
while
sufficed
to
make
them
understand
what
we
were
and
whither
we
were
going
and
what
we
needed
and
as
little
to
set
them
about
supplying
our
wants
feeding
us
bountifully
and
giving
us
a
comfortable
wigwam
for
our
night
s
rest
the
next
day
we
resumed
our
march
and
found
from
the
indians
that
we
were
only
about
miles
from
the
lake
they
sent
some
of
their
young
men
to
point
out
the
place
where
we
were
to
turn
off
and
parted
from
us
with
as
much
kindness
as
possible
in
passing
over
the
part
of
ohio
near
the
lake
where
such
an
extensive
plain
is
found
we
came
to
a
spot
overflowed
by
a
stream
across
which
the
road
passed
i
forded
it
first
with
the
help
of
a
and
then
taking
the
children
on
my
back
first
the
two
little
ones
and
then
the
others
one
at
a
time
and
lastly
my
wife
i
succeeded
in
getting
them
all
safely
across
where
the
ford
was
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
wide
and
the
deepest
part
perhaps
four
feet
deep
at
this
time
the
skin
was
worn
from
my
back
to
an
extent
almost
equal
to
the
size
of
my
knapsack
one
night
more
was
passed
in
the
woods
and
in
the
course
of
the
next
forenoon
we
came
out
upon
the
wide
plain
without
trees
which
lies
south
and
west
of
sandusky
city
we
saw
the
houses
of
the
village
and
kept
away
from
them
for
the
present
till
i
should
have
an
opportunity
to
reconnoitre
a
little
when
about
a
mile
from
the
lake
i
hid
my
companions
in
the
bushes
and
pushed
forward
before
i
had
gone
far
i
observed
on
the
left
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
town
something
which
looked
like
a
house
between
which
and
a
vessel
a
number
of
men
were
passing
and
repassing
with
activity
i
promptly
decided
to
approach
them
and
as
i
drew
near
i
was
hailed
by
one
of
the
number
who
asked
me
if
i
wanted
to
work
i
told
him
yes
and
it
was
scarcely
a
minute
before
i
had
hold
of
a
bag
of
corn
which
like
the
rest
i
emptied
into
the
hold
of
the
vessel
lying
at
anchor
a
few
rods
off
i
got
into
the
line
of
laborers
hurrying
along
the
plank
next
to
the
only
colored
man
i
saw
engaged
and
soon
entered
into
conversation
with
him
in
the
course
of
which
i
inquired
of
him
where
they
were
going
the
best
route
to
canada
who
was
the
captain
and
other
particulars
interesting
to
me
and
communicated
to
him
where
i
came
from
and
whither
i
wished
to
go
he
told
the
captain
who
called
me
one
side
and
by
his
frank
look
and
manner
soon
induced
me
to
acknowledge
my
condition
and
purpose
i
found
i
had
not
mistaken
him
he
sympathized
with
me
at
once
most
heartily
and
offered
to
take
me
and
my
family
to
buffalo
whither
they
were
bound
and
where
they
might
arrive
the
next
evening
if
the
favorable
wind
continued
of
which
they
were
hurrying
to
take
advantage
never
did
men
work
with
a
better
will
and
soon
two
or
three
hundred
bushels
were
thrown
on
board
the
hatches
were
fastened
down
the
anchor
raised
and
the
sails
hoisted
the
captain
had
agreed
to
send
a
boat
for
me
after
sundown
rather
than
take
me
on
board
at
the
landing
as
there
were
kentucky
spies
he
said
on
the
watch
for
slaves
at
sandusky
who
might
get
a
glimpse
of
me
if
i
brought
my
party
out
of
the
bush
by
daylight
i
watched
the
vessel
as
she
left
her
moorings
with
intense
interest
and
began
to
fear
that
she
would
go
without
me
after
all
she
stretched
off
to
so
great
a
distance
as
it
seemed
to
me
before
she
rounded
to
at
length
however
i
saw
her
come
up
to
the
wind
and
lower
a
boat
for
the
shore
and
in
a
few
minutes
my
black
friend
and
two
sailors
jumped
out
upon
the
beach
they
went
with
me
immediately
to
bring
my
wife
and
children
but
what
was
my
alarm
when
i
came
back
to
the
place
where
i
had
left
them
to
find
they
had
gone
for
a
moment
my
fears
were
overpowering
but
i
soon
discerned
them
in
the
fading
twilight
at
no
great
distance
my
wife
had
been
alarmed
by
my
long
absence
and
thought
i
must
have
been
discovered
by
some
of
our
watchful
enemies
and
had
given
up
all
for
lost
her
fears
were
not
removed
by
seeing
me
returning
with
three
other
men
and
she
tried
to
hide
herself
it
was
not
without
difficulty
that
i
satisfied
her
all
was
right
for
her
agitation
was
so
great
that
she
could
not
at
once
understand
what
i
said
however
this
was
soon
over
and
the
kindness
of
my
companions
facilitated
the
matter
very
much
before
long
we
were
all
on
the
way
to
the
boat
and
it
did
not
require
much
time
or
labor
to
embark
our
luggage
a
short
row
brought
us
to
the
vessel
and
to
my
astonishment
we
were
welcomed
on
board
with
three
hearty
cheers
for
the
crew
were
as
much
pleased
as
the
captain
with
the
help
they
were
giving
us
to
escape
a
fine
run
brought
us
to
buffalo
the
next
evening
but
it
was
too
late
to
cross
the
river
that
night
the
next
morning
we
dropped
down
to
black
rock
and
the
friendly
captain
whose
name
i
have
gratefully
remembered
as
captain
burnham
put
us
on
board
the
to
waterloo
paid
the
passage
money
and
gave
me
a
dollar
at
parting
he
was
a
scotchman
and
had
done
enough
to
win
my
enduring
gratitude
to
prove
himself
a
kind
and
generous
man
and
to
give
me
a
pleasant
association
with
his
dialect
and
his
country
when
i
got
on
the
canada
side
on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
my
first
impulse
was
to
throw
myself
on
the
ground
and
giving
way
to
the
riotous
exultation
of
my
feelings
to
execute
sundry
antics
which
excited
the
astonishment
of
those
who
were
looking
on
a
gentleman
of
the
neighborhood
colonel
warren
who
happened
to
be
present
thought
i
was
in
a
fit
and
as
he
inquired
what
was
the
matter
with
the
poor
fellow
i
jumped
up
and
told
him
was
o
said
he
with
a
hearty
laugh
is
that
it
i
never
knew
freedom
make
a
man
roll
in
the
sand
it
is
not
much
to
be
wondered
at
that
my
certainty
of
being
free
was
not
quite
a
sober
one
at
the
first
moment
and
i
hugged
and
kissed
my
wife
and
children
all
round
with
a
vivacity
which
made
them
laugh
as
well
as
myself
there
was
not
much
time
to
be
lost
though
in
frolic
even
at
this
extraordinary
moment
i
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
and
had
to
look
about
me
at
once
for
refuge
and
resource
i
found
a
lodging
for
the
night
and
the
next
morning
set
about
exploring
the
interior
for
the
means
of
support
i
knew
nothing
about
the
country
or
the
people
but
kept
my
eyes
and
ears
open
and
made
such
inquiries
as
opportunity
afforded
i
heard
in
the
course
of
the
day
of
a
hibbard
who
lived
some
six
or
seven
miles
off
and
who
was
a
rich
man
as
riches
were
counted
there
with
a
large
farm
and
several
small
tenements
on
it
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
letting
to
his
laborers
to
him
i
went
immediately
though
the
character
given
him
by
his
neighbors
was
not
by
any
means
unexceptionably
good
but
i
thought
he
was
not
probably
any
worse
than
those
i
had
been
accustomed
to
serve
and
that
i
could
get
along
with
him
if
honest
and
faithful
work
would
satisfy
him
in
the
afternoon
i
found
him
and
soon
struck
a
bargain
with
him
for
employment
i
asked
him
if
there
was
any
house
where
he
would
let
me
live
he
said
yes
and
led
the
way
to
an
old
two
story
sort
of
shanty
into
the
lower
story
of
which
the
pigs
had
broken
and
had
apparently
made
it
their
for
some
time
still
it
was
a
house
and
i
forthwith
expelled
the
pigs
and
set
about
cleaning
it
for
the
occupancy
of
a
better
sort
of
tenants
with
the
aid
of
hoe
and
shovel
and
a
mop
i
got
the
floor
into
a
tolerable
condition
by
midnight
and
only
then
did
i
rest
from
my
labor
the
next
day
i
brought
the
rest
of
the
hensons
to
and
though
there
was
nothing
there
but
bare
walls
and
floors
we
were
all
in
a
state
of
great
delight
and
my
old
woman
laughed
and
acknowledged
that
it
was
worth
while
and
that
it
was
better
than
a
with
an
i
begged
some
straw
of
hibbard
and
confining
it
by
logs
in
the
corners
of
the
room
i
made
beds
of
it
three
feet
thick
upon
which
we
reposed
luxuriously
after
our
long
fatigues
another
trial
awaited
me
which
i
had
not
anticipated
in
consequence
of
the
great
exposures
we
had
gone
through
my
wife
and
all
the
children
fell
sick
and
it
was
not
without
extreme
peril
that
they
escaped
with
their
lives
my
employer
soon
found
that
my
labor
was
of
more
value
to
him
than
that
of
those
he
was
accustomed
to
hire
and
as
i
consequently
gained
his
favor
and
his
wife
took
quite
a
fancy
to
mine
we
soon
procured
some
of
the
comforts
of
life
while
the
necessaries
of
food
and
fuel
were
abundant
i
remained
with
hibbard
three
years
sometimes
working
on
shares
and
sometimes
for
wages
and
i
managed
in
that
time
to
procure
some
pigs
a
cow
and
a
horse
thus
my
condition
gradually
improved
and
i
felt
that
my
toils
and
sacrifices
for
freedom
had
not
been
in
vain
nor
were
my
labors
for
the
improvement
of
myself
and
others
in
more
important
things
than
food
and
clothing
without
effect
it
so
happened
that
one
of
my
maryland
friends
arrived
in
this
neighborhood
and
hearing
of
my
being
here
inquired
if
i
ever
preached
now
and
spread
the
reputation
i
had
acquired
elsewhere
for
my
gifts
in
the
pulpit
i
had
said
nothing
myself
and
had
not
intended
to
say
any
thing
of
my
having
ever
officiated
in
that
way
i
went
to
meeting
with
others
when
i
had
an
opportunity
and
enjoyed
the
quiet
of
the
sabbath
when
there
was
no
assembly
i
would
not
refuse
to
labor
in
this
field
however
when
desired
to
do
so
and
i
hope
it
is
no
violation
of
modesty
to
state
the
fact
that
i
was
frequently
called
upon
not
by
blacks
alone
but
by
all
classes
in
my
vicinity
the
comparatively
educated
as
well
as
the
lamentably
ignorant
to
speak
to
them
on
their
duty
responsibility
and
immortality
on
their
obligations
to
their
maker
their
saviour
and
themselves
it
may
nay
i
am
aware
it
must
seem
strange
to
many
that
a
man
so
ignorant
as
myself
unable
to
read
and
having
heard
so
little
as
i
had
of
religion
natural
or
revealed
should
be
able
to
preach
acceptably
to
persons
who
had
enjoyed
greater
advantages
than
myself
i
can
explain
it
only
by
reference
to
our
saviour
s
comparison
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
a
plant
which
may
spring
from
a
seed
no
bigger
than
a
and
may
yet
reach
such
a
size
that
the
birds
of
the
air
may
take
shelter
therein
religion
is
not
so
much
knowledge
as
wisdom
and
observation
upon
what
passes
without
and
reflection
upon
what
passes
within
a
man
s
heart
will
give
him
a
larger
growth
in
grace
than
is
imagined
by
the
devoted
adherents
of
creeds
or
the
confident
followers
of
christ
who
call
him
lord
lord
but
do
not
the
things
which
he
says
hibbard
was
good
enough
to
give
my
eldest
boy
tom
two
quarters
schooling
to
which
the
schoolmaster
added
more
of
his
own
kindness
so
that
my
boy
learned
to
read
fluently
and
well
it
was
a
great
advantage
not
only
to
him
but
to
me
for
i
used
to
get
him
to
read
much
to
me
in
the
bible
especially
on
sunday
mornings
when
i
was
going
to
preach
and
i
could
easily
commit
to
memory
a
few
verses
or
a
chapter
from
hearing
him
read
it
over
one
beautiful
i
rose
early
and
called
him
to
come
and
read
to
me
where
shall
i
read
father
anywhere
my
son
i
answered
for
i
knew
not
how
to
direct
him
he
opened
upon
psalm
ciii
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
all
that
is
within
me
bless
his
holy
name
and
as
he
read
this
beautiful
outpouring
of
gratitude
which
i
now
first
heard
my
heart
melted
within
me
i
recalled
with
all
the
rapidity
of
which
thought
is
capable
the
whole
current
of
my
life
and
as
i
remembered
the
dangers
and
afflictions
from
which
the
lord
had
delivered
me
and
compared
my
present
condition
with
what
it
had
been
not
only
my
heart
but
my
eyes
overflowed
and
i
could
neither
check
nor
conceal
the
emotion
which
overpowered
me
the
words
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
with
which
the
psalm
begins
and
ends
were
all
i
needed
or
could
use
to
express
the
fulness
of
my
thankful
heart
when
he
had
finished
tom
turned
to
me
and
asked
father
who
was
david
he
had
observed
my
excitement
and
added
he
writes
pretty
don
t
he
and
then
repeated
his
question
it
was
a
question
i
was
utterly
unable
to
answer
i
had
never
heard
of
david
but
could
not
bear
to
acknowledge
my
ignorance
to
my
own
child
so
i
answered
evasively
he
was
a
man
of
god
my
i
suppose
so
said
he
but
i
want
to
know
something
more
about
him
where
did
he
live
what
did
he
do
as
he
went
on
questioning
me
i
saw
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
to
escape
and
so
i
told
him
frankly
i
did
not
know
why
father
said
he
can
t
you
read
this
was
a
worse
question
than
the
other
and
if
i
had
any
pride
in
me
at
the
moment
it
took
it
all
out
of
me
pretty
quick
it
was
a
direct
question
and
must
have
a
direct
answer
so
i
told
him
at
once
i
could
not
why
not
said
he
because
i
never
had
an
opportunity
to
learn
nor
anybody
to
teach
well
you
can
learn
now
no
my
son
i
am
too
old
and
have
not
time
enough
i
must
work
all
day
or
you
would
not
have
enough
to
then
you
might
do
it
at
but
still
there
is
nobody
to
teach
me
i
can
t
afford
to
pay
anybody
for
it
and
of
course
no
one
can
do
it
for
why
father
ll
teach
i
can
do
it
i
know
and
then
you
ll
know
so
much
more
that
you
can
talk
better
and
preach
the
little
fellow
was
so
earnest
there
was
no
resisting
him
but
it
is
hard
to
describe
the
conflicting
feelings
within
me
at
such
a
proposition
from
such
a
quarter
i
was
delighted
with
the
conviction
that
my
children
would
have
advantages
i
had
never
enjoyed
but
it
was
no
slight
mortification
to
think
of
being
instructed
by
a
child
of
twelve
years
old
yet
ambition
and
a
true
desire
to
learn
for
the
good
it
would
do
my
own
mind
conquered
the
shame
and
i
agreed
to
try
but
i
did
not
reach
this
state
of
mind
instantly
i
was
greatly
moved
by
the
conversation
i
had
had
with
tom
so
much
so
that
i
could
not
undertake
to
preach
that
day
the
congregation
were
disappointed
and
i
passed
the
sunday
in
solitary
reflection
in
the
woods
i
was
too
much
engrossed
with
the
multitude
of
my
thoughts
within
me
to
return
home
to
dinner
and
spent
the
whole
day
in
secret
meditation
and
prayer
trying
to
compose
myself
and
ascertain
my
true
position
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
my
predicament
was
one
of
profound
ignorance
and
that
i
ought
to
use
every
opportunity
of
enlightening
it
i
began
to
take
lessons
of
tom
therefore
immediately
and
followed
it
up
every
evening
by
the
light
of
a
pine
knot
or
some
hickory
bark
which
was
the
only
light
i
could
afford
weeks
passed
and
my
progress
was
so
slow
that
poor
tom
was
almost
discouraged
and
used
to
drop
asleep
sometimes
and
whine
a
little
over
my
dulness
and
talk
to
me
very
much
as
a
schoolmaster
talks
to
a
stupid
boy
till
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
my
age
my
want
of
practice
in
looking
at
such
little
scratches
the
daily
fatigue
and
the
dim
light
would
be
effectual
preventives
of
my
ever
acquiring
the
art
of
reading
but
tom
s
perseverance
and
mine
conquered
at
last
and
in
the
course
of
the
winter
i
did
really
learn
to
read
a
little
it
was
and
has
been
ever
since
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
have
made
this
acquisition
though
it
has
made
me
comprehend
better
the
terrible
abyss
of
ignorance
in
which
i
had
been
plunged
all
my
previous
life
it
made
me
also
feel
more
deeply
and
bitterly
the
oppression
under
which
i
had
toiled
and
groaned
but
the
crushing
and
cruel
nature
of
which
i
had
not
appreciated
till
i
found
out
in
some
slight
degree
from
what
i
had
been
debarred
at
the
same
time
it
made
me
more
anxious
than
before
to
do
something
for
the
rescue
and
the
elevation
of
those
who
were
suffering
the
same
evils
i
had
endured
and
who
did
not
know
how
degraded
and
ignorant
they
really
were
after
about
three
years
had
passed
i
improved
my
condition
again
by
taking
service
with
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
riseley
whose
residence
was
only
a
few
miles
distant
and
who
was
a
man
of
more
elevation
of
mind
than
hibbard
and
of
superior
abilities
at
his
place
i
began
to
reflect
more
and
more
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
blacks
who
were
already
somewhat
numerous
in
this
region
i
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
escaped
from
the
states
and
had
settled
on
the
first
spot
in
canada
which
they
had
reached
several
hundreds
of
colored
persons
were
in
the
neighborhood
and
in
the
first
joy
of
their
deliverance
were
going
on
in
a
way
which
i
could
see
led
to
little
or
no
progress
in
improvement
they
were
content
to
have
the
proceeds
of
their
labor
at
their
own
command
and
had
not
the
ambition
for
or
the
perception
of
what
was
within
their
easy
reach
if
they
did
but
know
it
they
were
generally
working
for
hire
upon
the
lands
of
others
and
had
not
yet
dreamed
of
becoming
independent
proprietors
themselves
it
soon
became
my
great
object
to
awaken
them
to
a
sense
of
the
advantages
which
offered
themselves
to
their
grasp
and
riseley
seeing
clearly
the
justness
of
my
views
and
willing
to
coöperate
with
me
in
the
attempt
to
make
them
generally
known
among
the
blacks
permitted
me
to
call
meetings
at
his
house
of
those
who
were
known
to
be
among
the
most
intelligent
and
successful
of
our
class
at
these
meetings
we
considered
and
discussed
the
subject
till
we
were
all
of
one
mind
and
it
was
agreed
among
the
ten
or
twelve
of
us
who
assembled
at
them
that
we
would
invest
our
earnings
in
land
and
undertake
the
task
which
though
no
light
one
certainly
would
yet
soon
reward
us
for
our
effort
of
settling
upon
wild
lands
which
we
could
call
our
own
and
where
every
tree
which
we
felled
and
every
bushel
of
corn
we
raised
would
be
for
ourselves
in
other
words
where
we
could
secure
all
the
profits
of
our
own
labor
the
advantages
of
this
course
need
not
be
dwelt
upon
in
a
country
which
is
every
day
exemplifying
it
and
has
done
so
for
two
hundred
years
and
more
and
has
by
this
very
means
acquired
an
indestructible
character
for
energy
enterprise
and
it
was
precisely
the
yankee
spirit
which
i
wished
to
instil
into
my
if
possible
and
i
was
not
deterred
from
the
task
by
the
perception
of
the
immense
contrast
in
all
the
habits
and
character
generated
by
long
ages
of
freedom
and
servitude
activity
and
sloth
independence
and
subjection
my
associates
agreed
with
me
and
we
resolved
to
select
some
spot
among
the
many
offered
to
our
choice
where
we
would
colonize
and
raise
our
own
crops
eat
our
own
bread
and
be
in
short
our
own
masters
i
was
deputed
to
explore
the
country
and
find
a
place
to
which
i
would
be
willing
to
migrate
myself
and
they
all
said
they
would
go
with
me
whenever
such
a
one
should
be
found
i
set
out
accordingly
in
the
autumn
of
and
travelled
on
foot
all
over
the
extensive
region
between
lakes
ontario
erie
and
huron
when
i
came
to
the
territory
east
of
lake
clair
and
detroit
river
i
was
strongly
impressed
with
its
fertility
its
convenience
and
indeed
its
superiority
for
our
purposes
to
any
other
spot
i
had
seen
i
determined
this
should
be
the
place
and
so
reported
on
my
return
to
my
future
companions
they
were
wisely
cautious
however
and
sent
me
off
again
in
the
summer
that
i
might
see
it
at
the
opposite
seasons
of
the
year
and
be
better
able
to
judge
of
its
advantages
i
found
no
reason
to
change
my
opinion
but
upon
going
further
towards
the
head
of
lake
erie
i
discovered
an
extensive
tract
of
government
land
which
for
some
years
had
been
granted
to
a
mccormick
upon
certain
conditions
and
which
he
had
rented
out
to
settlers
upon
such
terms
as
he
could
obtain
this
land
being
already
cleared
offered
some
advantages
for
the
immediate
raising
of
crops
which
were
not
to
be
overlooked
by
persons
whose
resources
were
so
limited
as
ours
and
we
determined
to
go
there
first
for
a
time
and
with
the
proceeds
of
what
we
could
earn
there
to
make
our
purchases
in
dawn
afterwards
this
plan
was
followed
and
some
dozen
or
more
of
us
settled
upon
these
lands
the
following
spring
and
accumulated
something
by
the
crops
of
wheat
and
tobacco
we
were
able
to
raise
i
discovered
before
long
that
mccormick
had
not
complied
with
the
conditions
of
his
grant
and
was
not
therefore
entitled
to
the
rent
he
exacted
from
settlers
i
was
advised
by
sir
john
cockburn
to
whom
i
applied
on
the
subject
to
appeal
to
the
legislature
for
relief
we
did
so
and
though
mccormick
was
able
by
the
aid
of
his
friends
to
defeat
us
for
one
year
yet
we
succeeded
the
next
upon
a
second
appeal
and
were
freed
from
all
rent
thereafter
so
long
as
we
remained
still
this
was
not
our
own
land
the
government
though
it
demanded
no
rent
might
set
up
the
land
for
sale
at
any
time
and
then
we
should
probably
be
driven
off
by
wealthier
purchasers
with
the
entire
loss
of
all
our
improvements
and
with
no
retreat
provided
it
was
manifest
that
it
was
altogether
better
for
us
to
purchase
before
competition
was
invited
and
we
kept
this
fully
in
mind
during
the
time
we
staid
here
we
remained
in
this
position
six
or
seven
years
and
all
this
while
the
colored
population
was
increasing
rapidly
around
us
and
spreading
very
fast
into
the
interior
settlements
and
the
large
towns
the
immigration
from
the
united
states
was
incessant
and
some
i
am
not
unwilling
to
admit
were
brought
hither
with
my
knowledge
and
connivance
i
was
glad
to
help
such
of
my
old
friends
as
had
the
spirit
to
make
the
attempt
to
free
themselves
and
i
made
more
than
one
trip
about
this
time
to
maryland
and
kentucky
with
the
expectation
in
which
i
was
not
disappointed
that
some
might
be
enabled
to
follow
in
my
footsteps
i
knew
the
route
pretty
well
and
had
much
greater
facilities
for
travelling
than
when
i
came
out
of
that
egypt
for
the
first
time
i
did
not
find
that
our
prosperity
increased
with
our
numbers
the
mere
delight
the
slave
took
in
his
freedom
rendered
him
at
first
contented
with
a
lot
far
inferior
to
that
which
he
might
have
attained
then
his
ignorance
led
him
to
make
unprofitable
bargains
and
he
would
often
hire
wild
land
on
short
terms
and
bind
himself
to
clear
a
certain
number
of
acres
and
by
the
time
they
were
cleared
and
fitted
for
cultivation
his
lease
was
out
and
his
landlord
would
come
in
and
raise
a
splendid
crop
on
the
new
land
and
the
tenant
would
very
likely
start
again
on
just
such
another
bargain
and
be
no
better
off
at
the
end
of
ten
years
than
he
was
at
the
beginning
another
way
in
which
they
lost
the
profits
of
their
labor
was
by
raising
nothing
but
tobacco
the
high
price
of
which
was
very
tempting
and
the
cultivation
of
which
was
a
monopoly
in
their
hands
as
no
white
man
understood
it
or
could
compete
with
them
at
all
the
consequence
was
however
that
they
had
nothing
but
tobacco
to
sell
there
was
rather
too
much
of
it
in
the
market
and
the
price
of
wheat
rose
while
their
commodity
was
depressed
and
they
lost
all
they
should
have
saved
in
the
profit
they
gave
the
trader
for
his
corn
and
stores
i
saw
the
effect
of
these
things
so
clearly
that
i
could
not
help
trying
to
make
my
friends
and
neighbors
see
it
too
and
i
set
seriously
about
the
business
of
lecturing
upon
the
subject
of
crops
wages
and
profits
as
if
i
had
been
brought
up
to
it
i
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
their
raising
their
own
crops
saving
their
own
wages
and
securing
the
profits
of
their
own
labor
with
such
plain
arguments
as
occurred
to
me
and
were
as
clear
to
their
comprehension
as
to
mine
i
did
this
very
openly
and
frequently
my
audience
consisted
in
part
of
the
very
traders
whose
inordinate
profits
upon
individuals
i
was
trying
to
diminish
but
whose
balance
of
profit
would
not
be
ultimately
lessened
because
they
would
have
so
many
more
persons
to
trade
with
who
would
be
able
to
pay
them
a
reasonable
advance
in
cash
or
its
equivalent
on
all
their
purchases
the
purse
is
a
tender
part
of
the
system
but
i
handled
it
so
gently
that
the
sensible
portion
of
my
natural
opponents
were
not
i
believe
offended
while
those
whom
i
wished
to
benefit
saw
for
the
most
part
the
propriety
of
my
advice
and
took
it
at
least
there
are
now
great
numbers
of
settlers
in
this
region
of
canada
who
own
their
farms
and
are
training
up
their
children
in
true
independence
and
giving
them
a
good
elementary
education
who
had
not
taken
a
single
step
towards
such
a
result
before
i
began
to
talk
to
them
i
said
none
of
the
respectable
traders
were
offended
with
me
but
one
man
had
the
folly
to
arrest
me
for
a
small
debt
under
the
pretence
that
i
was
about
to
leave
the
country
when
i
was
only
going
to
detroit
for
a
few
days
in
the
spring
leaving
my
crops
on
the
ground
and
all
my
family
at
home
but
one
little
girl
who
was
to
go
to
school
for
a
few
weeks
it
was
so
absurd
however
that
i
was
soon
released
by
some
of
my
friends
of
whom
i
had
many
among
the
whites
as
well
as
the
blacks
while
i
remained
at
colchester
i
became
acquainted
with
a
congregational
missionary
from
massachusetts
by
the
name
of
hiram
wilson
who
took
an
interest
in
our
people
and
was
disposed
to
do
what
he
could
to
promote
the
cause
of
improvement
which
i
had
so
much
at
heart
he
coöperated
with
me
in
many
efforts
and
i
have
been
associated
with
him
from
to
the
present
time
he
has
been
a
faithful
friend
and
still
continues
his
important
labors
of
love
in
our
behalf
among
other
things
which
he
did
for
us
then
he
wrote
to
a
quaker
friend
of
his
an
englishman
by
the
name
of
james
fuller
residing
at
skeneateles
new
york
and
endeavored
to
interest
him
in
the
welfare
of
our
struggling
population
he
succeeded
so
far
that
fuller
who
was
going
on
a
visit
to
england
promised
to
do
what
he
could
among
his
friends
there
to
induce
them
to
aid
us
he
came
back
with
fifteen
hundred
dollars
which
had
been
subscribed
for
our
benefit
it
was
a
great
question
how
this
sum
which
sounded
vast
to
many
of
my
brethren
should
be
appropriated
i
had
my
own
opinion
pretty
decidedly
made
up
as
to
what
it
was
best
for
us
all
to
do
with
it
but
in
order
to
come
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
call
a
convention
of
delegates
from
every
settlement
of
blacks
that
was
within
reach
that
all
might
see
that
whatever
was
decided
on
was
sanctioned
by
the
disinterested
votes
of
those
who
were
thought
by
their
companions
best
able
to
judge
what
was
expedient
wilson
and
myself
called
such
a
convention
therefore
to
meet
in
london
upper
canada
and
it
was
held
in
june
i
urged
the
appropriation
of
the
money
to
the
establishment
of
a
school
where
our
children
could
be
taught
those
elements
of
knowledge
which
are
usually
the
occupations
of
a
and
where
the
boys
could
be
taught
in
addition
the
practice
of
some
mechanic
art
and
the
girls
could
be
instructed
in
those
domestic
arts
which
are
the
proper
occupation
and
ornament
of
their
sex
such
an
establishment
would
train
up
those
who
would
afterwards
instruct
others
and
we
should
thus
gradually
become
independent
of
the
white
man
for
our
intellectual
progress
as
we
might
be
also
for
our
physical
prosperity
it
was
the
more
necessary
as
in
many
districts
owing
to
the
insurmountable
prejudices
of
the
inhabitants
the
children
of
the
blacks
were
not
allowed
to
share
the
advantages
of
the
common
school
there
was
some
opposition
to
this
plan
in
the
convention
but
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
which
continued
for
three
days
it
appeared
so
obviously
for
the
advantage
of
all
to
husband
this
donation
so
as
to
preserve
it
for
a
purpose
of
permanent
utility
that
the
proposal
was
at
last
unanimously
adopted
and
a
committee
of
three
was
appointed
to
select
and
purchase
a
site
for
the
establishment
wilson
and
myself
were
the
active
members
of
this
committee
and
after
traversing
the
country
for
several
months
we
could
find
no
place
more
suitable
than
that
upon
which
i
had
had
my
eye
for
three
or
four
years
for
a
permanent
settlement
in
the
town
of
dawn
we
therefore
bought
two
hundred
acres
of
fine
rich
land
on
the
river
sydenham
covered
with
a
heavy
growth
of
black
walnut
and
white
wood
at
four
dollars
the
acre
i
had
made
a
bargain
for
two
hundred
acres
adjoining
this
lot
on
my
own
account
and
circumstances
favored
me
so
that
the
man
of
whom
i
purchased
was
glad
to
let
me
have
them
at
a
large
discount
from
the
price
i
had
agreed
to
pay
if
i
would
give
him
cash
for
the
balance
i
owed
him
i
transferred
a
portion
of
the
advantage
of
this
bargain
to
the
institution
by
selling
to
it
one
hundred
acres
more
at
the
low
price
at
which
i
obtained
them
and
thus
the
school
has
three
hundred
acres
of
as
fine
land
and
as
well
situated
land
as
canada
can
show
at
a
very
moderate
cost
in
i
removed
with
my
family
to
dawn
and
as
a
considerable
number
of
my
friends
are
there
about
me
and
the
school
is
permanently
fixed
there
the
future
importance
of
this
settlement
seems
to
be
decided
there
are
many
other
settlements
which
are
considerable
and
indeed
the
colored
population
is
scattered
over
a
territory
which
does
not
fall
far
short
of
three
hundred
miles
in
extent
in
each
direction
and
probably
numbers
not
less
than
twenty
thousand
persons
in
all
we
look
to
the
school
and
the
possession
of
landed
property
by
individuals
as
two
great
means
of
the
elevation
of
our
oppressed
and
degraded
race
to
a
participation
in
the
blessings
as
they
have
hitherto
been
permitted
to
share
only
the
miseries
and
vices
of
civilization
my
efforts
to
aid
them
in
every
way
in
my
power
and
to
procure
the
aid
of
others
for
them
have
been
constant
i
have
made
many
journeys
into
new
york
connecticut
massachusetts
and
maine
in
all
of
which
states
i
have
found
or
made
some
friends
to
the
cause
and
i
hope
some
personal
friends
i
have
received
many
liberal
gifts
and
experienced
much
kindness
of
treatment
but
i
must
be
allowed
to
allude
particularly
to
the
donations
received
from
boston
by
which
we
have
been
enabled
to
erect
a
and
thus
to
begin
in
good
earnest
the
clearing
of
our
lands
and
to
secure
a
profitable
return
for
the
support
of
our
school
as
among
those
which
have
been
most
welcome
and
valuable
to
us
i
could
give
here
a
great
many
particulars
which
would
amuse
and
interest
the
reader
if
they
did
not
instruct
him
but
it
is
better
not
to
indulge
the
inclination
and
i
will
conclude
my
narrative
by
simply
recording
my
gratitude
heartfelt
and
inexpressible
to
god
and
to
many
of
my
for
the
vast
improvement
in
my
condition
both
physical
and
mental
for
the
great
degree
of
comfort
with
which
i
am
surrounded
for
the
good
i
have
been
enabled
to
effect
for
the
light
which
has
risen
upon
me
for
the
religious
privileges
i
enjoy
and
the
religious
hopes
i
am
permitted
to
cherish
for
the
prospects
opening
to
my
children
so
different
from
what
they
might
have
been
and
finally
for
the
cheering
expectation
of
benefiting
not
only
the
present
but
many
future
generations
of
my
race
