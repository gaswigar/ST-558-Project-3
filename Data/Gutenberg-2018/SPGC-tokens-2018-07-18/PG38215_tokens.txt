dear
girls
this
book
tells
the
story
of
mary
frances
a
little
girl
whose
great
ambition
was
to
help
her
mother
so
anxious
was
she
to
do
this
that
even
the
humble
kitchen
people
became
her
teachers
and
instructors
they
talked
to
her
a
thing
never
heard
of
before
helped
her
over
the
hard
places
and
explained
mysterious
secrets
she
could
never
otherwise
have
understood
they
wove
around
a
simple
little
book
of
recipes
her
mother
had
made
for
her
the
spell
of
fairyland
they
led
her
through
a
series
of
delightful
adventures
such
as
never
happened
to
any
girl
before
in
which
she
lived
for
three
whole
happy
weeks
and
out
of
which
she
emerged
no
longer
a
little
girl
but
a
real
little
woman
some
very
wise
people
would
call
this
a
story
book
some
a
manual
training
book
and
others
a
cookery
book
but
mary
frances
knows
better
she
knows
that
it
is
a
book
within
a
book
that
introduced
her
to
aunty
rolling
pin
and
a
lot
of
other
dear
dear
friends
such
as
no
little
girl
ever
had
before
and
whom
she
now
wishes
to
introduce
for
the
first
time
to
all
other
little
girls
i
know
that
she
gained
their
consent
to
do
this
because
she
told
me
so
in
the
hope
that
mary
frances
wish
may
be
realized
this
record
of
her
adventures
is
sent
out

tied
it
just
under
her
arms
crossing
the
strings
in
front
the
kitchen
people
held
their
breath
to
see
what
would
happen
next
suddenly
she
clapped
her
hands
the
very
thing

me
wo

have
a
lovely
time
look
at
the
fire
look
at
the
fire
what
a
tiny
voice
thought
the
little
girl
but
she
quickly
took
the
lids
off
the
stove
some
very
bright
coals
stared
up
at
her
the
fire
is
fine
she
said
aloud
and
she
looked
all
about
to
find
where
the
voice
came
from
but
she
saw
no
one
look
down
please
said
the
same
tiny
voice
this
time
very
distinctly
there
stood
the
funniest
little
wire
man
no
higher
than
the
little
girl
elbow
illustration
and
i
illustration
and
i
you
did
see

the
little
man

bread
into
my
head
and
hold
me
over
the
fire
mary
frances
leaned
over
and
gravely
put
a
slice
of
bread
in
toaster
he
looked
so
funny
standing
there
that
she
wanted
to
smile
but
thought
it
would
be
exactly
polite
to
so
helpful
a
friend
but
when
he
said
slide
up
my
collar
in
a
thick
smothery
sort
of
voice
she
laughed
aloud
before
she
could
stop
but
turned
the
sound
into
a
cough
so
quickly
that
toaster
man
looked
up
at
her
queerly
only
a
moment
and
she
pulled
the
ring
up
until
it
held
the
bread
tightly
in
place
now
lift
me
up
over
the
fire

demanded
mary

hesitated

hold
of
him

me

up
my
collar
never

my
legs
he
said
as
though
he
read
her
thoughts
see
to
them
and
he
folded
them
up
so
close
that
when
mary
frances
lifted
him
up
she
could
find
no
sign
of
them
oh

burnt
she
cried
as

of

of
the

milk
toast
would
taste
awful
good
wo

try
it

mister
said
iron
pot
that
you
got
a
dirty
face
yes
a
black
face
tea
kettle
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
was
boiling
mad
steam
blew
out
of
his
nose
in
every
direction
now
everybody
who
knows
anything
about
a
tea
kettle
can
imagine
how
very
angry
tea
kettle
was
as
soon
as
he
could
get
his
breath
he
blew
steam
all
over
iron
pot
my
face
is
black
is
it
well
yours
is
black
and
it
will
soon
be
black
and
blue
you
swallow
them
words
and
iron
pot
raised
his
queer
little
fists
sput
mocked
tea
kettle
getting
ready
to
spout
again
take
that
wang
came
down
the
little
fist
but
not
on
the
lid
of

kettle
oh
no
for
just
as
that
was
going
to
happen
mary

lifted
him
high
in
the
air
let
go
of
me
let
me
at
iron
pot
he
was
at
white
heat
be
quiet
said
mary
frances
shaking
him
quite
hard
what
all
this
about
iron
pot
commenced
it
sullenly
simmered
tea
kettle
iron
pot
called
me
names
why
said
mary
frances
this
is
disgraceful
now
you
sit
there
she
put
tea
kettle
on
the
front
of
the
stove
and
you
there
she
pulled
big
iron
pot
as
far
back
as
she
could
now
behave
yourselves
then
she
sat
down
to
rest
what
makes
them
quarrel
so
i
wonder
mary
frances
said
half
to
herself
all
the
kitchen
people
seem
so
kind
and
helpful
why
do
you
know
child
asked
aunty
rolling
pin
i
thought
everybody
knew
that
story
illustration
do
you
know

let
me
at
him
a
story
mary
frances
was
always
ready
to
listen
to
a
story
wo
you
tell
me
please
aunty
rolling
pin
cleared
her
voice
and
rolled
back
an
inch
or
two
to
a
more
comfortable
place
on
the
table
you
see
it
this
way
child
she
began
in
the
days
of
your
there
were
no
stoves
only
open
fireplaces
were
used
for
cooking
and
kettles
were
just
as
black
then
as
that
old
black
pot
there
illustration
in
the
days
of
your
great
grandmother
so
when
the
pot
called
the
kettle
black
the
kettle
said
yourself
and
no
harm
was
done
but
when
your
mother
got
that
fine
new
cook
stove
she
bought
that
bright
shiny
kettle
too
but
that
silly
old
pot
does
know
that
the
new
kettle
is
bright
and
shiny
so
it
keeps
on
calling
names
that
pot
does
know
it
fooling
itself
for
all
it
sees
is
its
own
homely
old
black
self
in
the
shiny
kettle
making
faces
and
that
what
comes
of
calling
names
child
chuckled
aunty
rolling
pin
as
she
ended
her
story
then
mr
tea
kettle
puffed
steam
importantly
and
clapped
his
little
lid
nothing
more
was
said
in
the
kitchen
for
several
seconds
illustration
kettles
were
just
as
black
thank
you
at
length
said
mary
frances
gratefully
to
aunty
rolling

then
she
added
very
firmly
and
gently
to
iron
pot
and
tea
kettle
i
want
you
to
promise
me
never
to
call
names
again
either
one
of
you

no

i

i
can
with
your
help
if
you
be
so
kind
i
will
child
aunty

gave
a
delighted
chuckle
been
waiting
patiently
for
the
chance

i
will
child
i
going

aunty
ah
i
glad
you
told
me
child
that
makes
everything
more
important
than
ever
so
as
you
gather
together
the
things
you
need
you
can
listen
ahem
to
aunty
rolling

wisdom
you
know
about
everything
said
mary

i
be
much
obliged
to
you
for
any
other
hints
during

i
be
glad

mother
expected
to
explain
everything
to
me
you
see
yes
yes
child
smiled
aunty
rolling
pin
seeing
mary
frances
looked
sad
but
i
see
you
have
sifted
the
flour
and
baking
powder
and
salt
into
a
bowl
and
poured
it
back
instead
of
using
a
bowl
it
a
good
idea
to
use
a
piece
of
heavy
paper
when
this
is
folded
the
flour
can
readily
be
poured
into
the
sifter
again
and
again
that
certainly
is
easier
said
mary
frances
putting
the
hint
to
practice
illustration
poured
into
the
sifter
again
and
again
in
order
to
get
the
baking
powder
into
every
bit
of
the
flour
they
should
be
sifted
together
three
times
now
i
see
you
are
working
the
butter
into
the
flour
rub
lightly
with
your
finger
tips
it
pour
the
milk
gradually
mix
well
the
dough
should
be
almost
sticky
but
not
too
soft
to
handle
now
it
my
turn
she
chuckled
as
mary
frances
turned
the
dough
on
a
board
but
if
you
are
going
to
make
thimble
biscuits
one
half
of
the
dough
is
enough
to
pat
out
for
them
and
i
can
make
the
rest
into
real
biscuits
what
a
splendid
idea
said
mary
frances
illustration
turned
the
dough
on
a
board
wonder
if
the
handles
are
her
ears
she
thought
softly
patting
the
dough
with
aunty
rolling
pin
as
she
bent
over
she
caught
the
sound
of
singing
and
this
is
the
song
aunty
rolling
pin
sang
to
and
fro
roly
poly
the
dough
round
as
an
apple
straight
as
a
rule
guess
who
i
am
or
i
send
you

what
she
said
and
mary
frances
did
like
to
explain
she
hastily
turned
to
her
work
it
did
take
long
to
cut
the
biscuits
as
she
had
often
helped
her
mother
in
baking
she
knew
how
to
dip
the
cutter
each
time
into
flour
that
the
dough
might
not
stick
she
used
the
large
thimble
she
had
brought
down
from
the
sewing
room
in
the
same
way
as
she
had
used
the
biscuit
cutter

it
did
take
long
to
cut
the
biscuits
are
they
too
sweet
she
cried
delightedly
as
she
laid
the
tiny
biscuits
side
by
side
but
not
touching
in
the
little
baking
pan
with
the
rest
of
the
dough
she
had
made
three
larger
ones
one
for

of

said

at

the
time

over
for
her
cooking
lesson

pare
and

i
do
wonder
whether
the
kitchen

will
talk
and
help
us
or
whether
they
can
help
but
one
person
it
would
be
pretty
hard
without
their
help

let
me
read
the

again
no

joyously
i
was
afraid
there

not
be
or
lard
enough
in
the
recipe
the
whole
art
of
making
good
pastry
is
in
having
as
much
lard
as
flour
and
using
as
little
water
as
possible
i
was
afraid
too
that
your
mother
would
not
put
in
the
book
for
when
flour
or
starch
grains
are
coated
in
fat
they
are
too
dry
to
well
in
cooking
and
can
not
burst
open
they
are
not
i
