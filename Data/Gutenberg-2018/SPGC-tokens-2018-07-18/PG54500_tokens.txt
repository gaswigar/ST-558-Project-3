the

left
the

on

she
did
not
reach
this
place
till

o

tells
me
that
we
may
expect
to
sail
certainly
in

wednesday
i
left
london
and
reached
gravesend
at
nine
in
the
morning
having
been
taught
to
exso
dirty
to
be
sure
the
place
has
all
the
advantages
of
an
english
november
to
assist
it
in
those
particulars
just
now
too
a
carriage
passed
my
windows
conveying
on
board
a
cargo
of
passengers
who
seemed
sincerely
afflicted
at
the
thoughts
of
leaving
their
dear
native
land
the
pigs
squeaked
the
ducks
quacked
and
the
fowls
screamed
and
all
so
dolefully
as
clearly
to
prove
that
was
no
dissembled
sorrow
and
after
them
more
affecting
than
all
came
a
wheelbarrow
with
a
solitary
porker
tied
in
a
basket
with
his
head
hanging
over
on
one
side
and
his
legs
sticking
out
on
the
other
who
neither
grunted
nor
moved
nor
gave
any
signs
of
life
but
seemed
to
be
of
quite
the
same
opinion
with
hannah
more
s
heroine
grief
is
for
wrongs
despair
for
mine
as
miss
o
neil
is
to
play
elwina
for
the
first
time
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
she
had
not
the
previous
advantage
of
seeing
the
speechless
despondency
of
this
poor
pig
it
might
have
furnished
her
with
some
valuable
hints
and
enabled
her
to
convey
more
perfectly
to
the
audience
the
expressive
silence
of
irremediable
distress
november
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
i
embarked
on
board
the
sir
godfrey
webster
captain
boyes
on
approaching
the
vessel
we
heard
the
loudest
of
all
possible
shrieks
proceeding
from
a
boat
lying
near
her
and
who
should
prove
to
be
the
complainant
but
my
former
acquaintance
the
despairing
pig
he
had
recovered
his
voice
to
protest
against
entering
the
ship
i
had
already
declared
against
climbing
up
the
accommodation
ladder
the
pig
had
precisely
the
very
same
objection
so
a
chair
being
a
broken
bucket
was
let
down
for
us
and
the
pig
and
myself
entered
the
vessel
by
the
same
conveyance
only
pig
had
the
precedence
and
was
hoisted
up
first
the
ship
proceeded
three
miles
and
then
the
darkness
obliged
us
to
come
to
an
anchor
there
are
only
two
other
cabin
passengers
a
j
and
a
s
the
latter
is
a
planter
in
the
mountains
jamaica
he
wonders
considering
how
much
benefit
great
britain
derives
from
the
west
indies
that
government
is
not
careful
to
build
more
churches
in
them
and
is
of
opinion
that
hedicating
the
negroes
is
the
only
way
to
make
them
appy

november
we
sailed
at
six
o
clock
passed
through
nob
s
hole
the
girdler
s
hole
and
the
pan
all
very
dangerous
sands
and
particularly
the
last
where
at
times
we
had
only
one
foot
water
below
us
by
half
past
four
and
at
five
came
to
an
anchor
in
the
queen
s
channel
never
having
seen
any
thing
of
the
kind
before
i
was
wonderfully
pleased
with
the
manoeuvring
of
several
large
ships
which
passed
through
the
sands
at
the
same
time
with
us
their
motions
seemed
to
be
effected
with
as
much
ease
and
dexterity
as
if
they
had
been
carriages
and
the
effect
as
they
pursued
each
other
s
track
and
windings
was
perfectly
beautiful
november
sunday
the
wind
was
contrary
and
we
had
to
beat
up
the
whole
way
we
did
not
reach
the
downs
till
past
four
o
clock
and
as
there
were
above
sixty
vessels
arrived
before
us
we
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
a
safe
berth
at
length
we
anchored
in
the
lower
roads
about
four
miles
off
deal
we
can
see
very
clearly
the
double
lights
in
the
vessel
moored
off
the
goodwin
sands
it
is
constantly
inhabited
by
two
families
who
reside
there
alternately
every
fortnight
except
when
the
weather
delays
the
exchange
the
sir
godfrey
webster
is
a
vessel
of
tons
and
was
formerly
in
the
east
india
service
i
have
a
very
clean
cabin
a
place
for
my
books
and
every
thing
is
much
more
comfortable
than
i
expected
the
wind
however
is
completely
west
the
worst
that
we
could
have
and
we
must
not
even
expect
a
change
till
the
full
moon
the
captain
pointed
out
a
man
to
me
who
had
been
with
him
in
a
violent
storm
off
the
bermudas
for
six
hours
together
the
flashes
of
lightning
were
so
unintermitting
that
the
eye
could
not
sustain
them
at
one
time
the
ship
seemed
to
be
completely
in
a
blaze
and
the
man
in
question
who
was
then
standing
at
the
wheel
near
the
captain
suddenly
cried
out
i
don
t
know
what
has
happened
to
me
but
i
can
neither
see
nor
stand
and
he
fell
down
upon
the
deck
he
was
taken
up
and
carried
below
and
it
appeared
that
the
lightning
had
affected
his
eyes
and
legs
in
a
degree
to
make
him
both
blind
and
lame
though
the
captain
who
was
standing
by
his
side
had
received
no
injury
in
three
or
four
days
the
man
was
quite
well
again
in
this
storm
no
less
than
thirteen
vessels
were
dismasted
or
otherwise
shattered
by
the
lightning
sea
whence
the
wind
blows
which
it
blows
the
of
the
stern
the
when
you
go
to
the
left
but
when
to
the
right
instead
of
larboard
helm
you
go
nearer
to
the
wind
thus
you
are
near
enough
no
you
are
too
near
the
wind

handle
of
the
rudder

the
weigher

the
anchor

the
ropes
which

the
sail

those
which
spread
out
the
sails
and
make
them
swell
november
at
six
this
morning
came
on
a
tremendous
gale
of
wind
the
captain
says
that
he
never
experienced
a
heavier
however
we
rode
it
out
with
great
success
although
at
one
time
it
was
bawled
out
that
we
were
driving
and
at
another
a
brig
which
lay
near
us
broke
from
her
moorings
and
came
bearing
down
close
upon
us
the
danger
indeed
from
the
difference
of
size
was
all
upon
the
side
of
the
brig
but
luckily
the
vessels
cleared
each
other
this
evening
she
has
thought
it
as
well
to
remove
further
from
so
dangerous
a
neighbourhood
there
is
a
little
cabin
boy
on
board
and
j
has
brought
with
him
a
black
terrier
and
these
two
at
first
sight
swore
to
each
other
an
eternal
friendship
in
the
true
german
style
it
is
the
boy
s
first
voyage
and
he
is
excessively
so
he
has
been
obliged
to
creep
into
his
hammock
and
his
friend
the
little
black
terrier
has
crept
into
the
hammock
with
him
a
boat
came
from
the
shore
this
evening
and
reported
that
several
vessels
have
been
dismasted
lost
their
anchors
and
injured
in
various
ways
a
brig
which
was
obliged
to
make
for
ramsgate
missed
the
pier
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
completely
the
crew
however
were
saved
all
except
the
pilot
who
although
he
was
brought
on
shore
alive
what
between
bruises
drowning
and
fright
had
suffered
so
much
that
he
died
two
hours
afterwards
the
weather
has
now
again
become
calm
but
it
is
still
full
west

when
in

reposing
sat
four

lovely

were

the
wind
altered
sufficiently
to
allow
us
to
escape
from
the
downs
and
at
dusk
we
were
off
beachy
head
this
morning
the
steward
left
the
of
the
open
of
course
i
immediately
contrived
to
step
into
it
and
was
on
the
point
of
being
precipitated
to
the
bottom
among
innumerable
boxes
of
grocery
bags
of
biscuit
and
porter
barrels
where
a
broken
limb
was
the
that
i
could
expect
luckily
i
fell
across
the
corner
of
the
trap
and
managed
to
support
myself
till
i
could
effect
my
escape
with
a
bruised
knee
and
the
loss
of
a
few
inches
of
skin
from
my
left
arm

november
off

the
last
point
of
england
november
sunday
at
one
this
morning
a
violent
gust
of
wind
came
on
and
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
carried
us
through
the
chops
of
the
channel
formed
by
the
scilly
rocks
and
the
isle
of
ushant
but
i
thought
that
the
advance
was
dearly
purchased
by
the
terrible
night
which
the
storm
made
us
pass
the
wind
roaring
the
waves
dashing
against
the
stern
till
at
last
they
beat
in
the
quarter
gallery
the
ship
too
rolling
from
side
to
side
as
if
every
moment
she
were
going
to
roll
over
and
over
j
was
heaved
off
one
of
the
sofas
and
rolled
along
till
he
was
stopped
by
the
table
he
then
took
his
seat
upon
the
floor
as
the
more
secure
position
and
half
an
hour
afterwards
another
heave
chucked
him
back
again
upon
the
sofa
the
captain
snuffed
out
one
of
the
candles
and
both
being
tied
to
the
table
could
not
relight
it
with
the
other
so
the
steward
came
to
do
it
when
a
sudden
heel
of
the
ship
made
him
extinguish
the
second
candle
tumbled
him
upon
the
sofa
on
which
i
was
lying
and
made
the
candle
which
he
had
brought
with
him
fly
out
of
the
candlestick
through
a
cabin
window
at
his
elbow
and
thus
we
were
all
left
in
the
dark
then
the
intolerable
noise
the
cracking
of
bulkheads
the
sawing
of
ropes
the
screeching
of
the
tiller
the
trampling
of
the
sailors
the
clattering
of
the
crockery
every
thing
above
deck
and
below
deck
all
in
motion
at
once
chairs
books
boxes
bundles
and
fenders
flying
to
one
end
of
the
room
and
the
next
moment
as
if
they
had
made
a
mistake
flying
back
again
to
the
other
with
the
same
hurry
and
confusion
confusion
worse
confounded
of
all
the
inconveniences
attached
to
a
vessel
the
incessant
noise
appears
to
me
the
most
insupportable
as
to
our
live
stock
they
seem
to
have
made
up
their
minds
on
the
subject
and
say
with
one
of
ariosto
s
knights
when
he
was
cloven
from
the
head
to
the
chine
corvien
our
fowls
and
ducks
are
screaming
and
quacking
their
last
by
dozens
and
by
tuesday
morning
it
is
supposed
that
we
shall
not
have
an
animal
alive
in
the
ship
except
the
black
terrier
and
my
friend
the
squeaking
pig
whose
vocal
powers
are
still
audible
maugre
the
storm
and
the
sailors
and
who
i
verily
believe
only
continues
to
survive
out
of
spite
because
he
can
join
in
the
general
chorus
and
help
to
increase
the
number
of
abominable
sounds
we
are
now
tossing
about
in
the
bay
of
biscay
i
shall
remember
it
as
long
as
i
live
the

front
could
never
have
beamed
more
terrible
upon
don
ferolo
whiskerandos
in
biscay
s
bay
when
he
took
him
prisoner
than
biscay
s
bay
itself
will
appear
to
the
next
time
that
i
approach
it
november
our
live
stock
has
received
an
increase
our
fowls
and
ducks
are
dead
to
be
sure
but
a
lark
flew
on
board
this
morning
blown
as
is
supposed
from
the
coast
of
france
in
five
minutes
it
appeared
to
be
quite
at
home
eat
very
readily
whatever
was
given
it
and
hopped
about
the
deck
without
fear
of
the
sailors
or
the
more
formidable
black
terrier
with
all
the
ease
and
assurance
imaginable
i
dare
say
it
blown
from
the
coast
of
france
november
the
weather
continues
intolerable
boisterous
waves
running
mountains
high
with
no
wind
or
a
foul
one
dead

day
which
prevent
our
making
any

keep

my
lodgings
the
carpenter
had
been
made
aware
that
there
was
a
leak
in
my
cabin
and
ordered
to
caulk
the
seams
but
i
suppose
he
thought
that
during
only
a
two
months
voyage
the
rain
might
very
possibly
never
find
out
the
hole
and
that
it
would
be
quite
time
enough
to
apply
the
remedy
when
i
should
have
felt
the
inconvenience
the
best
is
that
the
carpenter
happening
to
be
at
work
in
the
next
cabin
when
the
water
came
down
upon
me
i
desired
him
to
call
my
servant
in
order
that
i
might
get
up
on
account
of
the
leak
on
which
he
told
me
that
the
leak
could
not
be
helped
grumbled
a
good
deal
at
calling
up
the
servant
and
seemed
to
think
me
not
a
little
unreasonable
for
not
lying
quietly
and
suffering
myself
to
be
pumped
upon
by
this
of
his
own
providing
but
if
the
water
gets
the
ship
on
the
other
hand
last
night
the
poor
old
steward
was
very
near
getting
out
of
it
in
the
thick
of
the
storm
he
was
carrying
some
grog
to
the
mate
when
a
gun
which
drove
against
him
threw
him
off
his
balance
and
he
was
just
passing
through
one
of
the
when
luckily
he
caught
hold
of
a
rope
and
saved
himself
a
flew
on
board
this
morning
i
am
sure
we
have
no
need
of
birds
of
ill
omen
i
could
supply
the
place
of
a
whole
aviary
of
them
myself
november
reading
don
quixote
this
morning
i
was
greatly
pleased
with
an
instance
of
the
hero
s
politeness
which
had
never
struck
me
before
the
princess
micomicona
having
fallen
into
a
most
egregious
blunder
he
never
so
much
as
hints
a
suspicion
of
her
not
having
acted
precisely
as
she
has
stated
but
only
begs
to
know
her
reasons
for
taking
a
step
so
extraordinary
but
pray
madam
says
he
why
your
ladyship
land
at
ossuna
seeing
that
it
is
not
a
seaport
town
i
was
also
much
charmed
with
an
instance
of
conjugal
affection
in
the
same
work
sancho
being
just
returned
home
after
a
long
absence
the
first
thing
which
his
wife
teresa
asks
about
is
the
welfare
of
the
ass
i
have
brought
him
back
answers
sancho
and
in
much
better
health
and
condition
than
i
am
in
the
lord
be
praised
said
teresa
for
this
his
great
mercy
to
me
november
the
wind
continues
contrary
and
the
weather
is
as
disagreeable
and
perverse
as
it
can
well
be
indeed
i
understand
that
in
these
latitudes
nothing
can
be
expected
but
heavy
gales
or
dead
calms
which
makes
them
particularly
pleasant
for
sailing
especially
as
the
calms
are
by
far
the
most
disagreeable
of
the
two
the
wind
steadies
the
ship
but
when
she
creeps
as
slowly
as
she
does
at
present
scarcely
going
a
mile
in
four
hours
she
feels
the
whole
effect
of
the
sea
breaking
against
her
and
rolls
backwards
and
forwards
with
every
billow
as
it
rises
and
falls
in
the
mean
while
every
thing
seems
to
be
in
a
state
of
the
most
active
motion
except
the
ship
while
we
are
carrying
a
spoonful
of
soup
to
our
mouths
the
remainder
takes
the
glorious
golden
opportunity
to
empty
itself
into
our
laps
and
the
glasses
and
carry
on
a
perpetual
domestic
warfare
during
the
whole
time
of
dinner
like
the
guelphs
and
the
ghibellines
nothing
is
so
common
as
to
see
a
roast
goose
suddenly
jump
out
of
its
dish
in
the
middle
of
dinner
and
make
a
frisk
from
one
end
of
the
table
to
the
other
and
we
are
quite
in
the
habit
of
laying
wagers
which
of
the
two
boiled
fowls
will
arrive
at
the
bottom
first
the
fowl
without
the
liver
wing
was
the
favourite
but
the
knowing
ones
were
taken
in
the
uncarved
one
carried
it
hollow

on

how
oft
that
painful
doubt
will
start
to
blight
the
roseate
smile
of

and
cloud
the

and
sink

december
friday
the
captain
pointed
oat
to
me
a
who
about
three
years
ago
was
shaken
from
the
and
fell
through
the
scuttle
into
the
hold
the
distance
was
above
eighty
feet
yet
the
boy
was
taken
up
with
only
a
few
bruises
december
sunday
the
wind
during
the
last
two
days
has
been
more
favourable
and
at
nine
this
morning
we
were
in
the
latitude
of
madeira
december
sea
the
rope
ladders
by
which
the
sailors
climb
the
shrouds
the
the
the
divisions
by
which
the
sails
are
contracted
additional
sails
spread
for
the
purpose
of
catching
all
the
wind
possible
the
the
head
the
stern
the
very
sound
of
which
tells
one
that
it
must
be
something
very
terrible
having
the
stern
beat
in
by
the
sea
belay
a
to
fasten
it
december
i
had
no
idea
of
the
expense
of
building
and
preserving
a
ship
that
in
which
i
am
at
present
cost
at
its
outset
last
year
the
repairs
amounted
to
and
in
a
voyage
to
the
east
indies
they
were
more
than
in
its
return
last
year
from
jamaica
it
was
on
the
very
brink
of
shipwreck
a
storm
had
driven
it
into
bantry
bay
and
there
was
no
other
refuge
from
the
winds
than
bear
haven
whose
entrance
was
narrow
and
difficult
however
a
gentleman
from
castletown
came
on
board
and
very
obligingly
offered
to
pilot
the
ship
he
was
one
of
the
first
people
in
the
place
had
been
the
owner
of
a
vessel
himself
was
most
thoroughly
acquainted
with
every
inch
of
the
haven
and
so
on
they
went
there
was
but
one
sunken
rock
and
that
about
ten
feet
in
diameter
the
captain
knew
it
and
warned
his
to
keep
a
little
more
to
the
eastward
my
dear
friend
answered
the
irishman
now
do
just
make
yourself
i
know
well
enough
what
we
are
about
we
are
as
clear
of
the
rock
as
if
we
were
in
the
red
sea
by
jasus
upon
which
the
vessel
struck
upon
the
rock
and
there
she
stuck
the
captain
fell
to
swearing
and
tearing
his
hair
god
damn
you
sir
didn
t
i
tell
you
to
keep
to
eastward
dam
me
she
s
on
the
rock
oh
well
my
dear
she
s
now
the
rock
and
in
a
few
minutes
you
know
why
she
ll
be
the
rock
to
be
sure
i
d
have
taken
my
oath
that
the
rock
was
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
on
the
other
side
of
her
but
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
why
the
channel
is
not
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
itself
and
as
to
getting
her
off
bumping
against
this
rock
it
can
only
be
with
a
great
hole
in
her
poh
now
bother
my
dear
why
sure
leave
the
ship
sir
dam
me
sir
get
out
of
my
ship
this
moment
instead
of
which
with
the
most
smiling
and
obliging
air
in
the
world
the
irishman
turned
to
console
the
female
passengers
make
yourselves
ladies
pray
make
yourselves
perfectly
but
upon
my
soul
i
believe
your
captain
s
mad
no
danger
in
life
only
make
yourselves
i
say
for
the
ship
lies
on
the
rock
as
safe
and
as
quiet
by
jasus
as
if
she
were
lying
on
a
mud
bank
luckily
the
weather
was
so
perfectly
calm
that
the
ship
having
once
touched
the
rock
with
her
keel
bumped
no
more
it
was
low
water
she
wanted
but
five
inches
to
float
her
and
when
the
tide
rose
she
drifted
off
and
with
but
little
harm
done
the
then
thought
proper
to
return
on
shore
took
a
very
polite
leave
of
the
and
departed
with
all
the
urbanity
possible
only
the
captain
the
strangest
person
that
he
had
ever
met
with
and
wondering
that
any
man
of
common
sense
could
be
put
out
of
temper
by
such
a
trifle
december
yesterday
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
falling
in
with
the
trade
wind
and
now
we
are
proceeding
both
rapidly
and
steadily
the
change
of
climate
is
very
perceptible
and
the
deep
and
beautiful
blue
which
colours
the
sea
is
a
certain
intimation
of
our
approach
to
the
tropic
a
few
flying
fish
have
made
their
appearance
and
the
spears
are
getting
in
order
for
the
reception
of
their
constant
attendant
the
dolphin
these
spears
have
ropes
affixed
to
them
and
at
one
end
of
the
pole
are
five
barbs
at
the
other
a
heavy
ball
of
lead
then
when
the
fish
is
speared
the
striker
lets
the
staff
fall
on
which
down
goes
the
lead
into
the
sea
and
up
goes
the
dolphin
into
the
air
who
is
in
the
utmost
astonishment
to
find
itself
all
of
a
sudden
turned
into
a
flying
fish
so
determines
to
cultivate
the
art
of
flying
for
the
future
and
promises
itself
a
great
many
pleasant
airings
the
dolphin
and
the
flying
fish
are
beautifully
coloured
and
both
are
very
good
food
particularly
the
latter
which
move
in
shoals
like
the
herring
and
are
about
the
size
of
that
fish
they
are
supposed
to
feed
on
spawn
and
sea
animalculæ
and
will
not
take
the
bait
but
on
the
shores
of
barbadoes
which
they
frequent
in
great
multitudes
they
are
caught
in
wide
nets
spread
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
then
upon
beating
the
waters
around
the
fish
rise
in
clouds
and
fly
till
their
fins
getting
dry
they
fall
down
into
the
nets
which
have
been
spread
to
receive
them
the
dolphin
is
seldom
above
three
feet
long
the
immense
strength
which
he
exerts
in
his
struggles
for
liberty
occasions
the
necessity
of
catching
him
in
the
way
before
described
december
at
three
o
clock
this
afternoon
we
entered
the
tropic
of
cancer
and
if
our
wind
continues
tolerably
favourable
we
may
expect
to
see
antigua
on
sunday
on
crossing
the
line
it
was
formerly
usual
for
ships
to
receive
a
visit
from
an
old
gentleman
and
his
wife
and
cancer
the
husband
was
by
profession
a
barber
and
probably
the
scullion
who
insisted
so
peremptorily
on
shaving
sancho
at
the
duke
s
castle
had
served
an
apprenticeship
to
cancer
for
their
mode
of
proceeding
was
much
alike
and
indeed
very
peculiar
the
old
gentleman
always
made
a
point
of
using
a
rusty
iron
hoop
instead
of
a
razor
tar
for
soap
and
an
empty
was
in
his
opinion
the
very
best
possible
substitute
for
a
basin
in
consequence
of
which
instead
of
paying
him
for
shaving
them
people
of
taste
were
disposed
to
pay
for
not
being
shaved
and
as
cancer
happened
to
be
particularly
partial
to
gin
when
good
the
gift
of
a
few
bottles
was
generally
successful
in
rescuing
the
donor
s
chin
from
the
hands
of
her
husband
however
this
venerable
pair
peradventure
were
sleeping
or
on
a
journey
for
we
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
thing
about
them
december
when
after
his
victory
of
the
of
june
lord
howe
again
put
to
sea
from
portsmouth
the
number
of
women
who
were
turned
on
shore
out
of
the
ships
wives
sisters
amounted
to
above
thirty
thousand

december
a
dead
centipes
was
found
on
the
deck
supposed
to
have
made
its
way
on
board
during
the
last
voyage
among
the
logwood
this
is
not
the
only
species
of
disagreeable
passengers
who
are
in
the
habit
of
introducing
themselves
into
homeward
bound
vessels
without
leave
while
sleeping
on
deck
last
year
the
captain
felt
something
run
across
his
face
and
supposing
it
to
be
a
he
brushed
off
a
scorpion
but
not
without
its
first
biting
him
upon
the
cheek
the
pain
for
about
four
hours
was
excessive
but
although
he
did
no
more
than
wash
the
wound
with
spirits
he
was
perfectly
well
again
in
a
couple
of
days
december
since
we
entered
the
tropic
the
rains
have
been
incessant
and
most
violent
but
the
wind
was
brisk
and
favourable
and
we
proceeded
rapidly
now
we
have
lost
the
and
move
so
slowly
that
it
might
almost
be
called
standing
still
on
the
other
hand
the
weather
is
now
perfectly
delicious
the
ship
makes
but
little
way
but
she
moves
steadily
the
sun
is
brilliant
the
sky
cloudless
the
sea
calm
and
so
smooth
that
it
looks
like
one
extended
sheet
of
blue
glass
an
awning
is
stretched
over
the
deck
although
there
is
not
wind
enough
to
fill
the
canvass
there
is
sufficient
to
keep
the
air
cool
and
thus
even
during
the
day
the
weather
is
very
pleasant
but
the
nights
are
quite
heavenly
and
so
bright
that
at
ten
o
clock
yesterday
evening
little
jem
parsons
the
cabin
boy
and
his
friend
the
black
terrier
came
on
deck
and
sat
themselves
down
on
a
to
read
by
the
light
of
the
moon
i
looked
at
the
boy
s
book
the
terrier
i
suppose
read
over
the
other
s
shoulder
and
found
that
it
was
the
sorrows
of
i
asked
who
had
lent
him
such
a
book
and
whether
it
amused
him
he
said
that
it
had
been
made
a
present
to
him
and
so
he
had
read
it
almost
through
for
he
had
got
to
werter
s
dying
though
to
be
sure
he
did
not
understand
it
all
nor
like
very
much
what
he
understood
for
he
thought
the
man
a
great
fool
for
killing
himself
i
told
him
i
thought
every
man
a
great
fool
who
killed
himself
for
love
or
for
any
thing
else
but
had
he
no
books
but
the
sorrows
of
werter
oh
dear
yes
he
said
he
had
a
great
many
more
he
had
got
the
adventures
of
a
louse
which
was
a
very
curious
book
indeed
and
he
had
got
besides
the
recess
and
valentine
and
orson
and
castle
and
a
book
of
prayers
just
like
the
bible
but
he
could
not
but
say
that
he
liked
the
adventures
of
a
louse
the
best
of
any
of
them
december
we
caught
a
dolphin
but
not
with
the
spear
he
gorged
a
line
which
was
fastened
to
the
stern
and
baited
with
salt
pork
but
being
a
very
large
and
strong
fish
his
efforts
to
escape
were
so
powerful
that
it
was
feared
that
he
would
break
the
line
and
a
as
the
is
technically
termed
was
thrown
at
him
he
was
struck
and
three
of
the
prongs
were
buried
in
his
side
yet
with
a
violent
effort
he
forced
them
out
again
and
threw
the
lance
up
into
the
air
i
am
not
much
used
to
take
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
animal
suffering
but
if
pythagoras
himself
had
been
present
and
of
opinion
that
the
soul
of
his
grandam
might
haply
inhabit
this
dolphin
i
think
he
must
still
have
admired
the
force
and
agility
displayed
in
his
endeavours
to
escape
imagination
can
picture
nothing
more
beautiful
than
the
colours
of
this
fish
while
covered
by
the
waves
he
was
entirely
green
and
as
the
water
gave
him
a
case
of
transparent
crystal
he
really
looked
like
one
solid
piece
of
living
emerald
when
he
sprang
into
the
air
or
swam
fatigued
upon
the
surface
his
fins
alone
preserved
their
green
and
the
rest
of
his
body
appeared
to
be
of
the
brightest
yellow
his
scales
shining
like
gold
wherever
they
caught
the
sun
while
the
blood
which
as
long
as
he
remained
in
the
sea
continued
to
spout
in
great
quantities
forced
its
way
upwards
through
the
water
like
a
wreath
of
crimson
smoke
and
then
dispersed
itself
in
separate
globules
among
the
spray
from
the
great
loss
of
blood
his
colours
soon
became
paler
but
when
he
was
at
length
safely
landed
on
deck
and
beating
himself
to
death
against
the
flooring
agony
renewed
all
the
lustre
of
his
tints
his
fins
were
still
green
and
his
body
golden
except
his
back
which
was
olive
shot
with
bright
deep
blue
his
head
and
belly
became
silvery
and
the
spots
with
which
the
latter
was
mottled
changed
with
incessant
rapidity
from
deep
olive
to
the
most
beautiful
azure
gradually
his
brilliant
tints
disappeared
they
were
succeeded
by
one
uniform
shade
of
and
when
he
was
quite
dead
he
exhibited
nothing
but
dirty
brown
and
dull
dead
white
as
soon
as
all
was
over
with
him
the
first
thing
done
was
to
convert
one
of
his
fins
into
the
resemblance
of
a
flying
fish
for
the
purpose
of
decoying
other
dolphins
and
the
second
to
order
some
of
the
present
gentleman
to
be
got
ready
for
dinner
he
measured
above
four
feet
and
a
half
december
at
noon
we
found
ourselves
in
the
latitude
of
jamaica
we
were
promised
the
sight
of
antigua
on
sunday
next
but
that
is
now
quite
out
of
the
question
we
made
but
eight
miles
in
the
whole
of
yesterday
and
as
jamaica
is
still
at
the
distance
of
eighteen
hundred
miles
at
this
rate
of
proceeding
we
may
expect
to
reach
it
about
eight
months
hence
the
sky
this
evening
presented
us
with
quite
a
new
phenomenon
a
moon
she
is
to
be
at
her
full
and
this
afternoon
about
four
she
rose
like
a
disk
of
silver
perfectly
white
and
colourless
but
as
she
was
exactly
opposite
to
the
sun
at
the
time
of
his
setting
the
reflection
of
his
rays
spread
a
kind
of
pale
blush
over
her
orb
which
produced
an
effect
as
beautiful
as
singular
indeed
the
size
and
inconceivable
brilliance
of
the
sun
the
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
which
had
assumed
a
faint
greenish
hue
and
was
entirely
without
a
cloud
the
smoothness
of
the
ocean
and
the
aforesaid
moon
altogether
rendered
this
sunset
the
most
magical
in
effect
that
i
ever
beheld
and
it
was
with
great
reluctance
that
i
was
called
away
from
admiring
it
to
ascertain
whether
the
merits
of
our
new
acquaintance
the
dolphin
extended
any
further
than
his
skin
part
of
him
which
was
boiled
for
yesterday
s
dinner
was
rather
coarse
and
dry
and
might
have
been
mistaken
for
indifferent
haddock
but
his
having
been
steeped
in
brine
and
then
broiled
with
a
good
deal
of
pepper
and
salt
had
improved
him
wonderfully
and
i
thought
him
as
good
as
any
other
fish
our
wind
is
like
lady
townley
s
separate
allowance
that
little
has
been
made
less
or
rather
it
has
dwindled
away
to
nothing
we
are
now
so
absolutely
becalmed
that
i
begin
seriously
to
suspect
all
the
crew
of
being
phæacians
and
that
at
this
identical
moment
neptune
is
amusing
himself
by
making
the
ship
take
root
in
the
ocean
a
trick
which
he
played
once
before
to
a
vessel
they
say
in
the
days
of
ulysses
i
have
got
some
locust
plants
on
board
in
pots
if
we
continue
to
sail
as
slowly
as
we
have
done
for
the
last
week
before
we
reach
jamaica
my
plants
will
be
forest
trees
little
jem
the
will
have
been
obliged
to
shave
and
the
black
terrier
will
have
died
of
old
age
long
ago
great
numbers
of
porpoises
were
playing
about
and
tumbling
under
the
ship
s
very
nose
when
in
their
gambols
they
allow
themselves
to
be
seen
above
the
surface
they
are
of
a
dirty
blackish
brown
and
as
ugly
as
heart
can
wish
but
in
the
waves
they
acquire
a
fine
cast
and
their
spouting
up
water
in
the
sunbeams
is
extremely
ornamental
the
helmsman
hark
the
bell
it
sounds
midnight
all

soft

the
stars
on
their

while
o
er
the
full
moon
as
they
gently
are
driven
slowly
floating
the
clouds
bathe
their
fleeces
in
light
the
warm
feeble
breeze
scarcely
ripples
the
ocean
and
all
seems
so
hush
d
all
so
happy
to
feel
so
smooth
glides
the
bark
i
perceive
not
her
motion
while
low
sings
the
sailor
who
watches
the
wheel
that
sailor
i
ve
noted
his
cheek
fresh
and
blooming
with
health
scarcely
yet
twenty
springs
can
have
seen
his
looks
they
are
lofty
but
never
presuming
his
limbs
strong
but
light
and
undaunted
his
mien
frank
and
clear
is
his
brow
yet
a
thoughtful
expression
half
tender
half
mournful
oft
shadows
his
eye
and
murmurs
escape
him
which
make
the
confession

to
a
sigh
his
song
is
not

d
to
beguile
the
lone
hour
when
on
deck
tis
his
duty
to
keep
nor
of
painful
reflection
to
weaken
the
power
nor
chase
from
his
eyelids
the
pinions
of
sleep
tis
so
sad
tis
so
sweet
and
some
tones
come
so
swelling
so
right
from
the
heart
and
so
pure
to
the
ear
that
sure
at
this
moment
his
thoughts
must
be
dwelling
on
one
who
is
absent
most
kind
and
most
dear
perhaps
on

song

so
plaintive
sheds
balm
on
the
heart
and
the
pain
which
you

lovely
moon

a
gleam
of
mild
splendour
pure
tranquil
and
bright
the
seas
december
what
little
wind
there
is
blows
so
perversely
that
we
have
been
obliged
to
alter
our
course
and
instead
of
antigua
we
are
now
told
that
the
summer
islands
shakspeare
s
still
vexed
bermoothes
are
the
first
land
that
we
must
expect
to
see
i
am
greatly
disappointed
at
finding
such
a
scarcity
of
monsters
i
had
flattered
myself
that
as
soon
as
we
should
enter
the
atlantic
ocean
or
at
least
the
tropic
we
should
have
seen
whole
shoals
of
sharks
whales
and
dolphins
wandering
about
as
plenty
as
sheep
upon
the
south
downs
instead
of
which
a
brace
of
dolphins
and
a
few
flying
fish
and
porpoises
are
the
only
inhabitants
of
the
ocean
who
have
as
yet
taken
the
trouble
of
paying
us
the
common
civility
of
a
visit
however
i
am
promised
that
as
soon
as
we
approach
the
islands
i
shall
have
as
many
sharks
as
heart
can
wish
as
i
am
particularly
fond
of
proofs
of
conjugal
attachment
between
animals
in
the
human
species
they
are
so
universal
that
i
set
no
store
by
them
an
instance
of
that
kind
which
the
captain
related
to
me
this
morning
gave
me
great
pleasure
while
lying
in
black
river
harbour
jamaica
two
sharks
were
frequently
seen
playing
about
the
ship
at
length
the
female
was
killed
and
the
desolation
of
the
male
was
excessive
che

eurydice
what
he
did
her
remains
a
secret
but
what
he
did
her
was
clear
enough
for
scarce
was
the
breath
out
of
his
eurydice
s
body
when
he
stuck
his
teeth
in
her
and
began
to
eat
her
up
with
all
possible
expedition
even
the
sailors
felt
their
sensibility
excited
by
so
peculiar
a
mark
of
posthumous
attachment
and
to
enable
him
to
perform
this
melancholy
duty
the
more
easily
they
offered
to
be
his
carvers
lowered
their
boat
and
proceeded
to
chop
his
better
half
in
pieces
with
their
hatchets
while
the
widower
opened
his
jaws
as
wide
as
possible
and
gulped
down
pounds
upon
pounds
of
the
dear
departed
as
fast
as
they
were
thrown
to
him
with
the
greatest
delight
and
all
the
avidity
imaginable
i
make
no
doubt
that
all
the
while
he
was
eating
he
was
thoroughly
persuaded
that
every
morsel
which
went
into
his
stomach
would
make
its
way
to
his
heart
directly
she
was
perfectly
consistent
he
said
to
himself
she
was
excellent
through
life
and
really
she
s
extremely
good
now
she
s
dead
and
then
unable
to
conceal

pain

nothing
that
is
worthy
to
be
compared
to

nor
do
i
recollect
in
history
any
fact
at
all
resembling
it
except
perhaps
a
circumstance
which
is
recorded
respecting
cambletes
king
of
lydia
a
monarch
equally
remarkable
for
his
voracity
and
uxoriousness
and
who
being
one
night
completely
overpowered
by
sleep
and
at
the
same
time
violently
tormented
by
hunger
eat
up
his
queen
without
being
conscious
of
it
and
was
mightily
astonished
the
next
morning
to
wake
with
her
hand
in
his
mouth
the
only
bit
that
was
left
of
her
but
then
cambletes
was
quite
unconscious
what
he
was
doing
whereas
the
shark
s
mark
of
attachment
was
evidently
intentional
it
may
however
be
doubted
from
the
voracity
with
which
he
eat
whether
his
conduct
on
this
occasion
was
not
as
much
influenced
by
the
sentiment
of
hunger
as
of
love
and
if
he
were
absolutely
on
the
point
of
starving
tasso
might
have
applied
to
this
couple
with
equal
truth
although
with
somewhat
a
different
meaning
what
he
says
of

had

monsieur

for

no

as
well
as
from
having
nothing

to

all
the
crew
in
the
morning
betook
themselves
to
their
studies
the

was
very
seriously
spelling
a
comedy
edward
was
engaged
with
the
six
princesses
of
babylon
a

was
amusing
himself
with
a
tract
on
the
management
of
bees
another
had
borrowed
the

was
reading

aloud
to
a
large
circle
some
whistling
and

yawning
and
werter

abrupt
transitions
and

and
raptures
and
refinements
read
in

was
surprised
to
find
that
except

none

likely
to
amuse
them
smollett

for
instance
or
any
which
might
interest
them
as
relating
to
their
profession
such
as
voyages
and
travels
much
less
any
which
had
the
slightest
reference
to
the
particular
day
however
as
most
of
them
were
reading
what
they
could
not
possibly
understand
they
might
mistake
them
for
books
of
devotion
for
any
thing
they
knew
to
the
contrary
or
perhaps
they
might
have
so
much
reverence
for
all
books
in
print
as
to
think
that
provided
they
did
but
read
something
it
was
doing
a
good
work
and
it
did
not
much
matter
what
so
one
of
congreve
s
fine
ladies
swears
mincing
the
waiting
maid
to
secrecy
upon
an
odd
volume
of
messalina
s
sir
dudley
north
too
informs
us
or
is
it
his
brother
roger
but
i
mean
the
turkey
merchant
that
at
constantinople
the
respect
for
printed
books
is
so
great
that
when
people
are
sick
they
fancy
that
they
can
be
into
health
again
and
if
the
koran
should
not
be
in
the
way
they
will
make
a
shift
with
a
few
verses
of
the
bible
or
a
chapter
or
two
of
the
talmud
or
of
any
other
book
that
comes
first
to
hand
rather
than
not
read
something
i
think
sir
dudley
says
that
he
himself
cured
an
old
turk
of
the
toothache
by
administering
a
few
pages
of
ovid
s
metamorphoses
and
in
an
old
we
are
directed
for
the
cure
of
a
double
tertian
fever
to
drink
plentifully
of
and
sleep
with
the
second
book
of
the
iliad
under
the
if
instead
of
sleeping
with
it
under
the
pillow
the
doctor
had
desired
us
to
read
the
second
book
of
the
iliad
in
order
that
we
sleep
i
should
have
had
some
faith
in
his
prescription
myself
december
during
these
last
two
days
nothing
very
extraordinary
or
of
sufficient
importance
to
deserve
its
being
handed
down
to
the
latest
posterity
has
occurred
except
that
this
morning
a
swinging
rope
knocked
my
hat
into
the
sea
and
away
it
sailed
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
like
poor
la
perouse
to
return
no
more
i
suppose
unless
indeed
like
polycrates
the
fortunate
tyrant
of
samos
who
threw
his
favourite
ring
into
the
ocean
and
found
it
again
in
the
stomach
of
the
first
fish
that
was
served
up
at
his
table
i
should
have
the
good
luck
but
i
by
no
means
reckon
upon
it
to
catch
a
dolphin
with
my
hat
upon
his
head
as
to
a
porpoise
he
never
could
squeeze
his
great
numskull
into
it
but
our
dolphin
of
last
week
was
much
about
my
own
size
and
i
dare
say
such
another
would
find
my
hat
fit
him
to
a
miracle
and
look
very
well
in
it
december
the
weather
is
so
excessively
close
and
sultry
that
it
would
be
allowed
to
be
too
hot
to
be
pleasant
even
by
that
perfect
model
for
all
future
lords
of
the
bedchamber
who
was
never
known
to
speak
a
word
except
in
praise
of
any
thing
living
or
dead
through
the
whole
course
of
his
life
but
at
last
one
day
he
met
with
an
accident
he
happened
to
die
and
the
next
day
he
met
with
another
accident
he
happened
to
be
damned
and
immediately
upon
his
arrival
in
the
infernal
regions
the
devil
who
was
determined
to
be
as
well
bred
as
the
other
could
be
for
his
ears
came
to
pay
his
compliments
to
the
and
very
obligingly
expressed
his
concern
that
his
lordship
was
not
likely
to
feel
satisfied
with
his
new
abode
for
that
he
must
certainly
find
hell
very
hot
and
disagreeable
oh
dear
no
exclaimed
the
lord
of
the
bedchamber
not
at
all
disagreeable
by
any
manner
of
means
devil
upon
my
word
and
honour
rather
to
be
in
point
of
heat
there
is
no
difference
between
the
days
and
the
nights
or
if
there
is
any
it
is
that
the
nights
are
rather
the
hottest
of
the
two
the
lightning
is
incessant
and
it
does
not
show
itself
forked
or
in
flashes
but
in
wide
sheets
of
mild
blue
light
which
spread
themselves
at
once
over
the
sky
and
sea
and
for
the
moment
which
they
last
make
all
the
objects
around
as
distinct
as
in
daylight
the
moon
now
does
not
rise
till
near
ten
o
clock
and
during
her
absence
the
size
and
brilliancy
of
the
stars
are
admirable
in
england
they
always
seemed
to
me
to
borrow
a
phrase
of
shakspeare
s
which
in
truth
is
not
worth
borrowing
to
peep
through
the
blanket
of
the
dark
but
here
the
heavens
appear
to
be
studded
with
them
on
the
outside
as
if
they
were
chased
with
so
many
jewels
it
is
really
milton
s
firmament
of
living
sapphires
and
what
with
the
lightning
the
stars
and
the
quantity
of
floating
lights
which
just
gleamed
round
the
ship
every
moment
and
then
were
gone
again
the
sky
had
an
effect
so
beautiful
that
when
at
length
the
moon
thought
proper
to
show
her
great
red
drunken
face
i
thought
that
we
did
much
better
without
her
the
floating
lights
are
a
kind
of
which
as
i
am
told
are
produced
by
the
concussion
of
the
waves
while
eddying
in
whirlpools
round
the
rudder
but
still
i
saw
them
rise
sometimes
at
so
great
a
distance
from
the
ship
and
there
appeared
to
be
something
so
like
in
the
direction
of
their
course
sometimes
hurrying
on
sometimes
gliding
along
quite
slowly
now
stopping
and
remaining
motionless
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
hurrying
on
again
that
i
could
not
be
convinced
of
their
not
being
medusæ
or
some
species
or
other
of
phosphoric
animal
but
whatever
be
the
cause
of
this
appearance
the
effect
is
singularly
beautiful
as
to
air
we
have
not
enough
to
bless
ourselves
with
i
had
been
led
to
believe
that
when
once
we
should
have
fallen
in
with
the
trade
winds
from
that
moment
we
should
sail
into
our
destined
port
as
rapidly
and
as
directly
as
truffaldino
travels
in
gozzi
s
farce
when
having
occasion
to
go
from
asia
to
europe
and
being
very
much
pressed
for
time
he
persuades
a
conjuror
of
his
acquaintance
to
lend
him
a
devil
with
a
great
pair
of
bellows
the
nozzle
of
which
being
directed
right
against
his
stern
away
goes
the
traveller
before
the
stream
of
wind
with
the
devil
after
him
and
the
infernal
bellows
never
cease
from
working
till
they
have
blown
him
out
of
one
quarter
of
the
globe
into
another
but
our
trade
winds
must
hide
their
diminished
heads
before
truffaldino
s
bellows
it
seems
that
like
the
moors
in
africa
the
torrid
they
are
of
temper
somewhat
mulish
for
although
to
be
sure
when
they
blow
they
will
only
blow
in
one
certain
direction
yet
very
often
they
will
not
blow
at
all
which
has
been
our
case
for
the
last
week
indeed
they
seem
to
be
but
a
queerish
kind
of
a
concern
at
best
about
three
years
ago
a
fleet
of
merchantmen
was
becalmed
near
vincent
s
in
a
few
days
after
their
arrival
there
happened
a
violent
eruption
of
a
volcano
in
that
island
nor
was
it
long
before
a
favourable
breeze
sprang
up
unluckily
one
of
the
ships
had
anchored
rather
nearer
to
the
shore
than
the
others
and
was
at
the
distance
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
the
stream
of
the
trade
wind
nor
could
any
possible
efforts
of
the
crew
by
tacking
by
towing
or
otherwise
ever
enable
the
vessel
to
conquer
that
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
there
she
remained
as
completely
becalmed
as
if
there
were
not
such
a
thing
as
a
breath
of
wind
in
the
universe
and
on
the
one
hand
she
had
the
mortification
to
see
the
rest
of
the
merchantmen
with
their
convoy
for
it
was
in
the
very
heat
of
the
war
sail
away
with
all
their
canvass
spread
and
swelling
while
on
the
other
hand
the
sailors
had
the
comfortable
possibility
of
being
suffocated
every
moment
by
the
clouds
of
ashes
which
continued
to
fall
on
their
deck
every
moment
from
the
burning
volcano
although
they
were
not
nearer
to
vincent
s
than
eight
or
nine
miles
indeed
that
distance
went
for
nothing
as
ashes
fell
upon
vessels
that
were
out
at
sea
at
least
five
hundred
miles
and
barbadoes
being
to
windward
of
the
volcano
such
immense
quantities
of
its
contents
were
carried
to
that
island
as
almost
covered
the
fields
and
destroying
vegetation
completely
wherever
they
fell
did
inconceivable
damage
while
that
which
vincent
s
itself
experienced
was
but
trifling
in
proportion
our
captain
is
quite
out
of
patience
with
the
tortoise
pace
of
our
progress
for
my
part
i
care
very
little
about
it
whether
we
have
sailed
slowly
or
rapidly
when
a
day
is
once
over
i
am
just
as
much
nearer
advanced
towards
april
the
time
fixed
for
my
return
to
england
and
what
is
of
much
more
consequence
whether
we
have
sailed
slowly
or
rapidly
when
a
day
is
once
over
i
am
just
as
much
nearer
advanced
towards
that
bourne
to
reach
which
peaceably
and
harmlessly
is
the
only
business
of
life
and
towards
which
the
whole
of
our
existence
forms
but
one
continued
journey
december
we
succeeded
in
catching
another
dolphin
today
but
he
had
not
a
hat
on
however
i
just
asked
him
whether
he
happened
to
have
seen
mine
but
to
little
purpose
for
i
found
that
he
could
tell
me
nothing
at
all
about
it
so
instead
of
bothering
the
poor
animal
with
any
more
questions
we
eat
him
december
about
three
years
ago
the
captain
had
the
ill
luck
to
be
captured
by
a
french
frigate
as
she
had
already
made
prizes
of
two
other
merchantmen
it
was
determined
to
sink
his
ship
which
after
removing
the
crew
and
every
thing
in
her
that
was
valuable
was
effected
by
firing
her
own
guns
down
the
hatchways
it
was
near
three
hours
before
she
filled
then
down
she
went
with
a
single
plunge
head
foremost
with
all
her
sails
set
and
colours
flying
this
display
of
the
ship
s
magnificence
in
her
last
moments
reminded
me
of
mary
queen
of
scots
arraying
herself
in
her
richest
robes
that
she
might
go
to
the
scaffold
if
yorick
had
fallen
in
with
this
anecdote
in
the
course
of
his
journey
the
situation
of
the
captain
standing
on
the
enemy
s
deck
and
seeing
his
brave
vessel
in
full
and
gallant
trim
possessing
all
the
abilities
for
a
long
existence
yet
abandoned
by
every
one
and
sinking
from
the
effect
of
her
own
shot
might
have
furnished
him
with
a
companion
for
his
old
commercial
marquis
lamenting
over
the
rust
of
his
newly
recovered
sword
december
the
dolphin
does
then
the
insatiate
sea
relent
and
hath
he
back
those
treasures
sent
his
stormy
rage
devoured
all
starred
with
gems
the
billows
bound
and
emeralds
jacinths
sapphires
round
the
bark
in
spray
are
showered
no
no
t
is
there
the
dolphin
plays
his
scales
enriched
with
sunny
rays
celestial
tints
unfold
and
as
he
darts
the
waters
blue
are
streaked
with
gleams
of
many
a
hue
green

purple

and
brighter
still
will
shine
your
skin
poor
fish
more
dazzling

when
dying

like
good
men
who
expiring
bless
the
power
that

all

your
brightest
hour
your
last
and
now
the
spearman
watchful
stands
the
grainse
which

doomed
to

the

and
soon
on

the

perforce
you

the

s
such
and
such
we
all
must
be
there
is
a
technical
fault
in
the
above
lines
the
grainse
or
has
five
barbs
but
the
never
uses
a
lance
with
more
than
a
single
point
however
the
word
was
so
agreeable
to
my
ear
that
i
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
leave
it
out
december
sunday
at
length
we
have
crawled
into
the
caribbean
sea
i
was
told
that
we
were
not
to
expect
to
see
land
but
on
shipboard
our
not
seeing
a
thing
by
no
means
implies
that
we
shall
not
see
it
before
for
the
nautical
day
is
supposed
to
conclude
at
noon
when
the
solar
observation
is
taken
and
therefore
the
making
land
or
not
very
often
depends
upon
our
making
it
before
twelve
o
clock
or
after
it
this
was
the
case
in
the
present
instance
for
noon
was
scarcely
passed
when
we
saw
descada
a
small
island
totally
unprovided
with
water
and
whose
only
produce
consists
in
a
little
cotton
guadaloupe
and
marie
galante
though
the
latter
was
at
so
great
a
distance
as
to
be
scarcely
visible
at
sunset
antigua
was
in
sight
december
the
sun
rose
upon
montserrat
and
nevis
with
the
rock
between
them
apricis
natio
gratissima
mergis
for
it
is
perpetually
covered
with
innumerable
flocks
of
gulls
boobies
pelicans
and
other
sea
birds
then
came
christopher
s
and
eustatia
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
we
passed
over
the
bank
a
collection
of
sand
rock
and
mud
extending
about
two
hundred
miles
and
terminated
at
each
end
by
a
small
island
one
of
them
inhabited
by
a
few
fishermen
the
other
only
by
sea
birds
of
all
the
atlantic
isles
the
soil
of
christopher
s
is
by
some
supposed
to
be
the
richest
the
land
frequently
producing
three
hogsheads
an
acre
i
rather
think
that
this
was
the
first
island
discovered
by
columbus
and
that
it
took
its
name
from
his
montserrat
is
so
rocky
and
the
roads
so
steep
and
difficult
that
the
sugar
is
obliged
to
be
brought
down
in
bags
upon
the
backs
of
mules
and
not
put
into
casks
till
its
arrival
on
the
sea
shore
the
weather
is
now
quite
delicious
there
is
just
wind
enough
to
send
us
forward
and
keep
the
air
cool
the
sun
is
brilliant
without
being
overpowering
the
swell
of
the
waves
is
scarcely
perceptible
and
the
ship
moves
along
so
steadily
that
the
deck
affords
almost
as
firm
footing
as
if
we
were
walking
on
land
one
would
think
that
belinda
had
been
smiling
on
the
caribbean
sea
as
she
once
before
did
on
the
thames
and
had
made
all
the
world
look
during
the
night
we
passed
santa
cruz
an
island
which
from
the
perfection
to
which
its
cultivation
has
been
carried
is
called
the
garden
of
the
west
december
having
left
porto
rico
behind
us
at
noon
today
we
passed
the
insulated
rock
of
alcavella
lying
about
six
miles
from
domingo
which
is
now
in
sight
as
this
part
of
the
caribbean
sea
is
much
infested
by
pirates
from
the
caraccas
all
our
muskets
have
been
put
in
repair
and
the
guns
were
loaded
of
which
we
mount
eight
but
as
one
of
them
during
the
last
voyage
went
overboard
in
a
gale
of
wind
its
place
has
been
supplied
by
a
a
sham
gun
of
wood
so
called
i
suppose
because
it
would
not
fight
if
it
were
called
upon
these
are
small
schooners
armed
with
a
single
pounder
which
moves
upon
a
swivel
and
their
crew
is
composed
of
negroes
and
outlaws
of
all
nations
their
numbers
generally
running
from
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
for
the
first
time
i
saw
some
flying
fish
we
have
also
been
visited
by
several
birds
and
tropic
birds
the
latter
is
a
species
of
gull
perfectly
white
and
distinguished
by
a
single
very
long
feather
in
its
tail
its
nautical
name
is
the
as
we
sail
along
the
air
is
absolutely
loaded
with
sabean
odours
from
the
spicy
shores
of
domingo
which
we
were
still
coasting
at
sunset
december
at
jamaica
was
in
sight
or
rather
it
would
have
been
in
sight
only
that
we
could
not
see
it
the
weather
was
so
gloomy
and
the
wind
and
rain
were
so
violent
that
we
might
have
said
to
the
captain
as
one
of
the
two
punches
who
went
into
the
ark
is
reported
to
have
said
to
the
patriarch
during
the
deluge
hazy
weather
master
i
remember
my
good
friend
walter
scott
asserts
that
at
the
death
of
a
poet
the
groans
and
tears
of
his
heroes
and
heroines
swell
the
blast
and
increase
the
river
perhaps
something
of
the
same
kind
takes
place
at
the
arrival
of
a
west
india
proprietor
from
europe
and
all
this
rain
and
wind
proceed
from
the
eyes
and
lungs
of
my
agents
and
overseers
who
for
the
last
twenty
years
have
been
reigning
in
my
dominions
with
despotic
authority
but
now
whose
groans
in
roaring
winds
complain
whose
tears
of
rage
impel
the
rain
because
on
the
approach
of
the
sovereign
himself
they
must
evacuate
the
palace
and
resign
the
deputed
sceptre
hinc
illæ
lachrymæ
this
is
the
cause
of
our
being
soaked
to
the
skin
this
morning
however
about
noon
the
weather
cleared
up
and
allowed
us
to
verify
with
our
own
eyes
that
we
had
reached
the
land
of
springs
without
having
been
invited
by
any
piccaroon
vessel
to
walk
the
plank
instead
of
the
deck
which
is
a
compliment
very
generally
paid
by
those
gentry
after
they
have
taken
the
trouble
of
laying
a
plank
over
the
side
of
a
captured
ship
in
order
that
the
passengers
and
the
crew
may
walk
overboard
without
any
inconvenience
we
arrived
at
the
east
end
of
the
island
passed
pedro
point
and
starvegut
bay
and
arrived
before
black
river
bay
our
destined
harbour
soon
after
two
o
clock
but
here
we
were
obliged
to
come
to
a
stand
still
the
channel
is
very
dangerous
extremely
narrow
and
full
of
sunken
rocks
so
that
it
can
only
be
entered
by
a
vessel
drawing
so
much
water
as
ours
with
a
particular
wind
and
when
there
is
not
any
apprehension
of
a
sudden
squall
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
drop
anchor
and
are
now
riding
within
a
couple
of
miles
of
the
shore
but
with
as
utter
an
incapability
of
reaching
it
as
if
we
were
still
at
gravesend
the
north
side
of
the
island
is
said
to
be
extremely
beautiful
and
romantic
but
the
south
which
we
coasted
is
low
barren
and
without
any
recommendation
whatever
as
yet
i
can
only
look
at
jamaica
as
one
does
on
a
man
who
comes
to
pay
money
and
whom
we
are
extremely
well
pleased
to
see
however
little
the
fellow
s
appearance
may
be
in
his
favour
we
passed
the
whole
of
the
day
in
vain
endeavours
to
work
ourselves
into
the
bay
at
one
time
indeed
we
got
very
near
the
shore
but
the
consequence
was
that
we
were
within
an
ace
of
striking
upon
a
rock
and
very
much
obliged
to
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
which
blowing
right
off
shore
blew
us
out
of
the
channel
and
left
us
at
night
in
a
much
more
perilous
situation
than
we
had
occupied
the
evening
before
though
even
that
had
been
by
no
means
secure
at
three
o
clock
the
other
passengers
went
on
shore
in
the
and
proceeded
to
their
destination
but
as
i
was
still
more
than
thirty
miles
distant
from
my
estate
i
preferred
waiting
on
board
till
the
captain
should
have
moored
his
vessel
in
safety
and
be
at
liberty
to
take
me
in
his
pinnace
to
savannah
la
mar
when
i
should
find
myself
within
a
few
miles
of
my
own
house
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
one
of
the
sailors
took
up
a
fish
of
a
very
singular
shape
and
most
brilliant
colours
as
it
floated
along
upon
the
water
it
seemed
to
be
gasping
and
lay
with
its
belly
upwards
it
was
supposed
to
have
eaten
something
poisonous
as
whenever
it
was
touched
it
appeared
to
be
full
of
life
and
squirted
the
water
in
our
faces
with
great
spirit
and
dexterity
but
no
sooner
was
he
suffered
to
remain
quiet
in
the
tub
than
he
turned
upon
his
back
and
again
was
gasping
he
had
a
large
round
transparent
globule
intersected
with
red
veins
under
the
belly
which
some
imagined
to
proceed
from
a
rupture
and
to
be
the
occasion
of
his
disease
but
i
could
not
discover
any
vestige
of
a
wound
and
the
globule
was
quite
solid
to
the
touch
neither
did
the
fish
appear
to
be
sensible
when
it
was
pressed
upon
no
one
on
board
had
ever
seen
this
kind
of
fish
till
then
its
name
is
the
doctor
a
black
pilot
came
on
board
yesterday
in
a
canoe
hollowed
out
of
the
and
when
it
returned
for
him
this
morning
it
brought
us
a
i
never
met
with
a
worse
article
in
my
life
the
pulp
is
of
a
faint
greenish
yellow
stained
here
and
there
with
spots
of
moist
red
so
that
it
looks
exactly
as
if
the
servant
in
slicing
it
had
cut
his
finger
and
suffered
it
to
bleed
over
the
fruit
then
the
seeds
being
of
a
dark
purple
present
the
happiest
imitation
of
drops
of
clotted
gore
and
altogether
prejudiced
as
i
was
by
its
appearance
when
i
had
put
a
single
bit
into
my
mouth
it
had
such
a
kind
of
shylocky
taste
of
raw
flesh
about
it
not
that
i
recollect
having
ever
eaten
a
bit
of
raw
flesh
itself
that
i
sent
away
my
plate
and
was
perfectly
satisfied
as
to
the
merits
of
the
fruit
january
at
length
the
ship
has
squeezed
herself
into
this
champagne
bottle
of
a
bay
perhaps
the
satisfaction
attendant
upon
our
having
overcome
the
difficulty
added
something
to
the
illusion
of
its
effect
but
the
beauty
of
the
atmosphere
the
dark
purple
mountains
the
shores
covered
with
mangroves
of
the
liveliest
green
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
water
and
the
houses
with
their
lattices
and
piazzas
completely
embowered
in
trees
altogether
made
the
scenery
of
the
bay
wear
a
very
picturesque
appearance
and
to
complete
the
charm
the
sudden
sounds
of
the
drum
and
banjee
called
our
attention
to
a
procession
of
the
which
was
proceeding
to
celebrate
the
opening
of
the
new
year
at
the
town
of
black
river
the
is
a
dressed
in
a
striped
doublet
and
bearing
upon
his
head
a
kind
of
pasteboard
filled
with
puppets
representing
some
sailors
others
soldiers
others
again
slaves
at
work
on
a
plantation
the
negroes
are
allowed
three
days
for
holidays
at
christmas
and
also
s
day
which
being
the
last
is
always
reckoned
by
them
as
the
festival
of
the
greatest
importance
it
is
for
this
day
that
they
reserve
their
finest
dresses
and
lay
their
schemes
for
displaying
their
show
and
expense
to
the
greatest
advantage
and
it
is
then
that
the
is
considered
not
merely
as
a
person
of
material
consequence
but
one
whose
presence
is
absolutely
indispensable
nothing
could
look
more
gay
than
the
procession
which
we
now
saw
with
its
train
of
attendants
all
dressed
in
white
and
marching
two
by
two
except
when
the
file
was
broken
here
and
there
by
a
single
horseman
and
its
band
of
negro
music
and
its
scarlet
flags
fluttering
about
in
the
breeze
now
disappearing
behind
a
projecting
clump
of
mangrove
trees
and
then
again
emerging
into
an
open
part
of
the
road
as
it
wound
along
the
shore
towards
the
town
of
black
river
magno
telluris
amore
egressi
optatâ
troes
potiuntur
i
had
determined
not
to
go
on
shore
till
i
should
land
for
good
and
all
at
savannah
la
mar
but
although
i
could
resist
the
telluris
amor
there
was
no
resisting
so
in
defiance
of
a
broiling
afternoon
s
sun
about
four
o
clock
we
left
the
vessel
for
the
town
it
was
as
i
understand
formerly
one
of
some
magnitude
but
it
now
consists
only
of
a
few
houses
owing
to
a
spark
from
a
or
a
candle
having
lodged
upon
a
during
dry
weather
and
although
the
conflagration
took
place
at
the
whole
town
was
reduced
to
ashes
the
few
streets
i
believe
there
were
not
above
two
but
those
were
wide
and
regular
and
the
houses
looked
very
neat
were
now
crowded
with
people
and
it
seemed
to
be
allowed
upon
all
hands
that
s
day
had
never
been
celebrated
there
with
more
expense
and
festivity
it
seems
that
many
years
ago
an
admiral
of
the
red
was
superseded
on
the
jamaica
station
by
an
admiral
of
the
blue
and
both
of
them
gave
balls
at
kingston
to
the
girls
for
the
fair
sex
elsewhere
are
called
the
brown
girls
in
jamaica
in
consequence
of
these
balls
all
kingston
was
divided
into
parties
from
thence
the
division
spread
into
other
districts
and
ever
since
the
whole
island
at
christmas
is
separated
into
the
rival
factions
of
the
blues
and
the
reds
the
red
representing
also
the
english
the
blue
the
scotch
who
contend
for
setting
forth
their
processions
with
the
greatest
taste
and
magnificence
this
year
several
gentlemen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
black
river
had
subscribed
very
largely
towards
the
expenses
of
the
show
and
certainly
it
produced
the
gayest
and
most
amusing
scene
that
i
ever
witnessed
to
which
the
mutual
jealousy
and
pique
of
the
two
parties
against
each
other
contributed
in
no
slight
degree
the
champions
of
the
rival
roses
the
guelphs
and
the
ghibellines
none
of
them
could
exceed
the
scornful
animosity
and
spirit
of
depreciation
with
which
the
blues
and
the
reds
of
black
river
examined
the
efforts
at
display
of
each
other
the
blues
had
the
advantage
beyond
a
doubt
this
a
red
girl
told
us
that
she
could
not
deny
but
still
though
the
reds
were
beaten
she
would
not
be
a
blue
girl
for
the
whole
universe
on
the
other
hand
miss
edwards
the
mistress
of
the
hotel
from
whose
window
we
saw
the
show
was
rank
blue
to
the
very
tips
of
her
fingers
and
had
indeed
contributed
one
of
her
female
slaves
to
sustain
a
very
important
character
in
the
show
for
when
the
blue
procession
was
ready
to
set
forward
there
was
evidently
a
hitch
something
was
wanting
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
possibility
of
getting
on
without
it
when
suddenly
we
saw
a
tall
woman
dressed
in
mourning
being
miss
edwards
herself
rush
out
of
our
hotel
dragging
along
by
the
hand
a
strange
uncouth
kind
of
a
glittering
tawdry
figure
all
feathers
and
pitchfork
and
painted
pasteboard
who
moved
most
reluctantly
and
turned
out
to
be
no
less
a
personage
than
britannia
herself
with
a
pasteboard
shield
covered
with
the
arms
of
great
britain
a
trident
in
her
hand
and
a
helmet
made
of
pale
blue
silk
and
silver
the
poor
girl
it
seems
was
bashful
at
appearing
in
this
conspicuous
manner
before
so
many
spectators
and
hung
back
when
it
came
to
the
point
but
her
mistress
had
seized
hold
of
her
and
placed
her
by
main
force
in
her
destined
position
the
music
struck
up
miss
edwards
gave
the
goddess
a
great
push
forwards
the
drumsticks
and
the
elbows
of
the
fiddlers
attacked
her
in
the
rear
and
on
went
britannia
the
blue
girls
called
themselves
the
blue
girls
of
their
motto
was
the
more
patriotic
that
of
the
red
was
the
more
gallant
britannia
rules
the
day
streamed
upon
the
blue
flag
red
girls
for
ever
floated
upon
the
red
but
in
point
of
taste
and
invention
the
former
carried
it
hollow
first
marched
britannia
then
came
a
band
of
music
then
the
flag
then
the
blue
king
and
queen
the
queen
splendidly
dressed
in
white
and
silver
in
scorn
of
the
opposite
party
her
train
was
borne
by
a
little
girl
in
red
his
majesty
wore
a
full
british
admiral
s
uniform
with
a
white
satin
sash
and
a
huge
cocked
hat
with
a
gilt
paper
crown
upon
the
top
of
it
these
were
immediately
followed
by
nelson
s
car
being
a
kind
of
canoe
decorated
with
blue
and
silver
drapery
and
with
trafalgar
written
on
the
front
of
it
and
the
procession
was
closed
by
a
long
train
of
blue
grandees
the
women
dressed
in
uniforms
of
white
with
robes
of
blue
muslin
all
princes
and
princesses
dukes
and
duchesses
every
mother
s
child
of
them
the
red
girls
were
also
dressed
very
gaily
and
prettily
but
they
had
nothing
in
point
of
invention
that
could
vie
with
nelson
s
car
and
britannia
and
when
the
red
throne
made
its
appearance
language
can
not
express
the
contempt
with
which
our
landlady
eyed
it
it
was
neither
one
thing
nor
t
other
miss
edwards
was
of
opinion
merely
a
few
yards
of
calico
stretched
over
some
planks
and
look
look
only
look
at
it
behind
you
may
see
the
bare
boards
by
way
of
a
throne
indeed
well
to
be
sure
miss
edwards
never
saw
a
poorer
thing
in
her
life
that
she
must
say
and
then
she
told
me
that
somebody
had
just
snatched
at
a
medal
which
britannia
wore
round
her
neck
and
had
endeavoured
to
force
it
away
i
asked
her
who
had
done
so
oh
one
of
the
red
party
course
the
red
party
was
evidently
miss
edwards
s
grundy
made
no
part
of
the
procession
but
he
and
his
rival
a
personage
of
whom
i
heard
but
could
not
obtain
a
sight
seemed
to
act
upon
quite
an
independent
interest
and
go
about
from
house
to
house
tumbling
and
playing
antics
to
pick
up
money
for
themselves
a
play
was
now
proposed
to
us
and
of
course
accepted
three
men
and
a
girl
accordingly
made
their
appearance
the
men
dressed
like
the
tumblers
at
astley
s
the
lady
very
tastefully
in
white
and
silver
and
all
with
their
faces
concealed
by
masks
of
thin
blue
silk
and
they
proceeded
to
perform
the
quarrel
between
douglas
and
glenalvon
and
the
fourth
act
of
the
fair
they
were
all
quite
perfect
and
had
no
need
of
a
prompter
as
to
lothario
he
was
by
far
the
most
comical
dog
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
his
dying
scene
exceeded
all
description
coates
himself
might
have
taken
hints
from
him
as
soon
as
lothario
was
fairly
dead
and
calista
had
made
her
exit
in
distraction
they
all
began
dancing
reels
like
so
many
mad
people
till
they
were
obliged
to
make
way
for
the
waterloo
procession
who
came
to
collect
money
for
the
next
year
s
festival
one
of
them
singing
another
dancing
to
the
tune
while
she
presented
her
to
the
spectators
and
the
rest
of
the
blue
girls
filling
up
the
chorus
i
can
not
say
much
in
praise
of
the
black
catalani
but
nothing
could
be
more
light
and
playful
and
graceful
than
the
extempore
movements
of
the
dancing
girl
indeed
through
the
whole
day
i
had
been
struck
with
the
precision
of
their
march
the
ease
and
grace
of
their
action
the
elasticity
of
their
step
and
the
lofty
air
with
which
they
carried
their
heads
all
indeed
except
poor
britannia
who
hung
down
hers
in
the
most
manner
imaginable
the
first
song
was
the
old
scotch
air
of
logie
of
buchan
of
which
the
girl
sang
one
single
stanza
forty
times
over
but
the
second
was
in
praise
of
the
hero
of
heroes
so
i
gave
the
songstress
a
dollar
to
teach
it
to
me
and
drink
the
duke
s
health
it
was
not
easy
to
make
out
what
she
said
but
as
well
as
i
could
understand
them
the
words
ran
as
follows
come
rise
up
our
gentry
and
hear
about
waterloo
ladies
take
your
and
attend
to
what
we
do
for
one
and
one
makes
two
but
one
alone
must
be
then
singee
singee
waterloo
none
so
brave
as
he
and
then
there
came
something
about
green
and
white
flowers
and
a
duchess
and
a
pig
and
going
on
board
of
a
dashing
man
of
war
but
what
they
all
had
to
do
with
the
duke
or
with
each
other
i
could
not
make
even
a
guess
i
was
going
to
ask
for
an
explanation
but
suddenly
half
of
them
gave
a
shout
loud
enough
to
fright
the
realms
of
chaos
and
old
night
and
away
they
flew
singers
dancers
and
all
the
cause
of
this
was
the
sudden
illumination
of
the
town
with
quantities
of
large
chandeliers
and
bushes
the
branches
of
which
were
stuck
all
over
with
great
blazing
torches
the
effect
was
really
beautiful
and
the
excessive
rapture
of
the
black
multitude
at
the
spectacle
was
as
well
worth
the
witnessing
as
the
sight
itself
i
never
saw
so
many
people
who
appeared
to
be
so
unaffectedly
happy
in
england
at
fairs
and
races
half
the
visiters
at
least
seem
to
have
been
only
brought
there
for
the
sake
of
traffic
and
to
be
too
busy
to
be
amused
but
here
nothing
was
thought
of
but
real
pleasure
and
that
pleasure
seemed
to
consist
in
singing
dancing
and
laughing
in
seeing
and
being
seen
in
showing
their
own
fine
clothes
or
in
admiring
those
of
others
there
were
no
people
selling
or
buying
no
servants
and
landladies
bustling
and
passing
about
and
at
eight
o
clock
as
we
passed
through
the
where
was
the
greatest
illumination
and
which
of
course
was
most
thronged
i
did
not
see
a
single
person
drunk
nor
had
i
observed
a
single
quarrel
through
the
course
of
the
day
except
indeed
when
some
thoughtless
fellow
crossed
the
line
of
the
procession
and
received
by
the
way
a
good
box
of
the
ear
from
the
queen
or
one
of
her
attendant
duchesses
every
body
made
the
same
remark
to
me
well
sir
what
do
you
think
wilberforce
would
think
of
the
state
of
the
negroes
if
he
could
see
this
scene
and
certainly
to
judge
by
this
one
specimen
of
all
beings
that
i
have
yet
seen
these
were
the
happiest
as
we
were
passing
to
our
boat
through
the
suddenly
we
saw
miss
edwards
dart
out
of
the
crowd
and
seize
the
captain
s
arm
captain
captain
cried
she
for
the
love
of
heaven
only
look
at
the
lights
old
iron
hoops
nothing
but
old
iron
hoops
i
declare
well
for
my
part
and
then
with
a
contemptuous
toss
of
her
head
away
frisked
miss
edwards
triumphantly
january
the
elizabeth
which
sailed
from
england
at
the
same
time
with
our
vessel
was
attacked
by
a
pirate
from
carthagena
near
the
rocks
of
alcavella
who
attempted
three
times
to
board
her
though
he
was
at
length
beaten
off
so
that
our
piccaroon
preparations
were
by
no
means
taken
without
foundation
at
four
o
clock
this
morning
i
embarked
in
the
cutter
for
savannah
la
mar
lighted
by
the
most
beautiful
of
all
possible
morning
stars
certainly
if
this
star
be
really
lucifer
that
son
of
the
morning
the
devil
must
be
an
extremely
pretty
but
in
spite
of
the
fineness
of
the
morning
our
passage
was
a
most
disagreeable
concern
there
was
a
violent
swell
in
the
sea
and
a
strong
north
wind
though
it
carried
us
forward
with
great
rapidity
overwhelmed
us
with
whole
sheets
of
foam
so
incessantly
that
i
expected
as
soon
as
the
sun
should
have
evaporated
the
moisture
to
see
the
boat
s
crew
covered
with
salt
and
looking
like
so
many
lot
s
wives
after
her
metamorphosis
the
distance
was
about
thirty
miles
and
soon
after
nine
o
clock
we
reached
savannah
la
mar
where
i
found
my
trustee
and
a
whole
cavalcade
waiting
to
conduct
me
to
my
own
estate
for
he
had
brought
with
him
a
curricle
and
pair
for
myself
a
gig
for
my
servant
two
black
boys
upon
mules
and
a
cart
with
eight
oxen
to
convey
my
baggage
the
road
was
excellent
and
we
had
not
above
five
miles
to
travel
and
as
soon
as
the
carriage
entered
my
gates
the
uproar
and
confusion
which
ensued
sets
all
description
at
defiance
the
works
were
instantly
all
abandoned
every
thing
that
had
life
came
flocking
to
the
house
from
all
quarters
and
not
only
the
men
and
the
women
and
the
children
but
by
a
bland
assimilation
the
hogs
and
the
dogs
and
the
geese
and
the
fowls
and
the
turkeys
all
came
hurrying
along
by
instinct
to
see
what
could
possibly
be
the
matter
and
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
arriving
too
late
whether
the
pleasure
of
the
negroes
was
sincere
may
be
doubted
but
certainly
it
was
the
loudest
that
i
ever
witnessed
they
all
talked
together
sang
danced
shouted
and
in
the
violence
of
their
gesticulations
tumbled
over
each
other
and
rolled
about
upon
the
ground
twenty
voices
at
once
enquired
after
uncles
and
aunts
and
grandfathers
and
of
mine
who
had
been
buried
long
before
i
was
in
existence
and
whom
i
verily
believe
most
of
them
only
knew
by
tradition
one
woman
held
up
her
little
naked
black
child
to
me
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
look
massa
look
here
him
nice
lilly
neger
for
massa
another
complained
so
long
since
none
come
see
we
massa
good
massa
come
at
as
for
the
old
people
they
were
all
in
one
and
the
same
story
now
they
had
lived
once
to
see
massa
they
were
ready
for
dying
them
no
the
shouts
the
gaiety
the
wild
laughter
their
strange
and
sudden
bursts
of
singing
and
dancing
and
several
old
women
wrapped
up
in
large
cloaks
their
heads
bound
round
with
handkerchiefs
leaning
on
a
staff
and
standing
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
hubbub
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
portico
which
i
occupied
formed
an
exact
counterpart
of
the
festivity
of
the
witches
in
macbeth
nothing
could
be
more
odd
or
more
novel
than
the
whole
scene
and
yet
there
was
something
in
it
by
which
i
could
not
help
being
affected
perhaps
it
was
the
consciousness
that
all
these
human
beings
were
my
to
be
sure
i
never
saw
people
look
more
happy
in
my
life
and
i
believe
their
condition
to
be
much
more
comfortable
than
that
of
the
labourers
of
great
britain
and
after
all
slavery
in
case
is
but
another
name
for
servitude
now
that
no
more
negroes
can
be
forcibly
carried
away
from
africa
and
subjected
to
the
horrors
of
the
voyage
and
of
the
seasoning
after
their
arrival
but
still
i
had
already
experienced
in
the
morning
that
juliet
was
wrong
in
saying
what
s
in
a
name
for
soon
after
my
reaching
the
at
savannah
la
mar
a
remarkably
cleanlooking
negro
lad
presented
himself
with
some
water
and
a
towel
i
concluded
him
to
belong
to
the
inn
and
on
my
returning
the
towel
as
he
found
that
i
took
no
notice
of
him
he
at
length
ventured
to
introduce
himself
by
saying
massa
not
know
me
your
slave
and
really
the
sound
made
me
feel
a
pang
at
the
heart
the
lad
appeared
all
gaiety
and
good
humour
and
his
whole
countenance
expressed
anxiety
to
recommend
himself
to
my
notice
but
the
word
slave
seemed
to
imply
that
although
he
did
feel
pleasure
then
in
serving
me
if
he
had
detested
me
he
must
have
served
me
still
i
really
felt
quite
humiliated
at
the
moment
and
was
tempted
to
tell
him
do
not
say
that
again
say
that
you
are
my
negro
but
do
not
call
yourself
my
altogether
they
shouted
and
sang
me
into
a
violent
headach
it
is
now
one
in
the
morning
and
i
hear
them
still
shouting
and
singing
i
gave
them
a
holiday
for
saturday
next
and
told
them
that
i
had
brought
them
all
presents
from
england
and
so
i
believe
we
parted
very
good
friends
january
i
have
reached
jamaica
in
the
best
season
for
seeing
my
property
in
a
favourable
point
of
view
it
is
crop
time
when
all
the
laborious
work
is
over
and
the
negroes
are
the
most
healthy
and
merry
this
morning
i
went
to
visit
the
hospital
and
found
there
only
eight
patients
out
of
three
hundred
negroes
and
not
one
of
them
a
serious
case
yesterday
i
had
observed
a
remarkably
handsome
creole
girl
called
psyche
and
she
really
deserved
the
name
this
morning
a
little
brown
girl
made
her
appearance
at
breakfast
with
an
orange
bough
to
flap
away
the
flies
and
on
enquiry
she
proved
to
be
an
emanation
of
the
aforesaid
psyche
it
is
evident
therefore
that
psyche
has
already
visited
the
palace
of
cupid
i
heartily
hope
that
she
is
not
now
upon
her
road
to
the
infernal
regions
but
as
the
ancients
had
two
cupids
one
divine
and
the
other
sensual
so
am
i
in
possession
of
two
psyches
and
on
visiting
the
hospital
was
poor
psyche
the
second
probably
this
was
the
psyche
of
the
sensual
cupid
i
passed
the
morning
in
driving
about
the
estate
my
house
is
frightful
to
look
at
but
very
clean
and
comfortable
on
the
inside
some
of
the
scenery
is
very
picturesque
from
the
lively
green
of
the
trees
and
shrubs
and
the
appearance
of
the
negro
buildings
all
situated
in
little
gardens
and
embosomed
in
shrubberies
indeed
every
thing
appears
much
better
than
i
expected
the
negroes
seem
healthy
and
contented
and
so
perfectly
at
their
ease
that
our
english
squires
would
be
mightily
astonished
at
being
accosted
so
familiarly
by
their
farmers
this
delightful
north
wind
keeps
the
air
temperate
and
agreeable
i
live
upon
shaddocks
and
the
dreaded
mosquitoes
are
not
worse
than
gnats
nor
as
bad
as
the
sussex
and
as
yet
i
never
felt
myself
in
more
perfect
health
there
was
a
man
once
who
fell
from
the
top
of
a
steeple
and
perceiving
no
inconvenience
in
his
passage
through
the
air
come
said
he
to
himself
while
in
the
act
of
falling
really
this
is
well
enough
yet
if
it
would
but
cubina
my
young
savannah
la
mar
acquaintance
is
appointed
my
black
attendant
and
as
i
had
desired
him
to
bring
me
any
native
flowers
of
jamaica
this
evening
he
brought
me
a
very
pretty
one
the
negroes
he
said
called
it
but
in
white
language
it
was
it
proved
to
be
the
wild
ipecacuanha
january
there
were
three
things
against
which
i
was
particularly
cautioned
and
which
three
things
i
was
determined
to
do
to
take
exercise
after
ten
in
the
day
to
be
exposed
to
the
dews
after
and
to
sleep
at
a
jamaica
so
yesterday
i
set
off
for
montego
bay
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
travelled
till
three
walked
home
from
a
ball
after
midnight
and
that
home
was
a
at
montego
bay
but
the
was
such
a
cool
clean
and
the
landlady
was
such
an
obliging
smiling
landlady
with
the
whitest
of
all
possible
teeth
and
the
blackest
of
all
possible
eyes
that
no
harm
could
happen
to
me
from
occupying
an
apartment
which
had
been
prepared
by
she
was
called
out
of
her
bed
to
make
my
room
ready
for
me
yet
she
did
every
thing
with
so
much
and
cordiality
no
quick
answers
no
mutterings
inns
would
be
bowers
of
paradise
if
they
were
all
rented
by
mulatto
landladies
like
judy
james
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
scenery
of
montego
bay
and
with
the
neatness
and
cleanliness
of
the
town
indeed
what
with
the
sea
washing
it
and
the
picturesque
aspect
of
the
piazzas
and
verandas
it
is
impossible
for
a
west
indian
town
so
situated
and
in
such
a
climate
not
to
present
an
agreeable
appearance
but
the
first
part
of
the
road
exceeds
in
beauty
all
that
i
have
ever
seen
it
wound
through
mountain
lands
of
my
own
their
summits
of
the
boldest
and
at
the
same
time
of
the
most
beautiful
shapes
their
sides
ornamented
with
bright
green
woods
of
bamboo
logwood
and
trumpet
trees
and
so
completely
covered
with
the
most
lively
verdure
that
once
when
we
found
a
piece
of
barren
rock
cubina
pointed
it
out
to
me
as
a
curiosity
look
massa
rock
quite
naked
the
presented
itself
on
all
sides
but
as
this
is
the
season
for
its
shedding
its
leaves
its
bare
white
arms
contributed
nothing
to
the
beauty
of
the
scene
except
where
the
wild
fig
and
various
creeping
plants
had
completely
mantled
the
stems
and
branches
and
then
its
gigantic
height
and
the
fantastic
wreathings
of
its
limbs
from
which
numberless
green
withes
and
strings
of
wild
flowers
were
streaming
rendered
it
exactly
the
very
tree
for
which
a
would
have
wished
the
air
too
was
delicious
the
fragrance
of
the
and
of
several
other
scented
trees
but
above
all
of
the
delicious
logwood
of
which
most
of
the
fences
in
westmoreland
are
made
composed
an
atmosphere
such
that
if
satan
after
promising
them
a
buxom
air
embalmed
with
odours
had
transported
sin
and
death
thither
the
charming
couple
must
have
acknowledged
their
papa
s
promises
fulfilled
we
travelled
these
first
ten
miles
montego
bay
being
about
thirty
from
my
estate
of
cornwall
without
seeing
a
human
creature
nor
indeed
any
thing
that
had
life
in
it
except
a
black
snake
basking
in
the
sunshine
and
a
few
john
crows
a
species
of
vulture
whose
utility
is
so
great
that
its
destruction
is
prohibited
by
law
under
a
heavy
penalty
in
a
country
where
putrefaction
is
so
rapid
it
is
of
infinite
consequence
to
preserve
an
animal
which
if
a
bullock
or
horse
falls
dead
in
the
field
immediately
flies
to
the
carcass
before
it
has
time
to
corrupt
and
gobbles
it
up
before
you
can
say
john
crow
much
less
jack
robinson
the
bite
of
the
black
snake
is
slightly
venomous
but
that
is
all
as
to
the
great
yellow
one
it
is
perfectly
innoxious
and
so
timid
that
it
always
runs
away
from
you
the
only
dangerous
species
of
serpent
is
the
so
called
from
its
exactly
resembling
the
lash
of
a
whip
in
length
thinness
pliability
and
whiteness
but
even
the
bite
of
this
is
not
mortal
except
from
very
great
neglect
the
most
beautiful
tree
or
rather
group
of
trees
all
to
nothing
is
the
bamboo
both
from
its
verdure
and
from
its
elegance
of
form
as
to
the
cotton
tree
it
answers
no
purpose
either
of
ornament
or
utility
or
rather
it
is
not
suffered
to
answer
any
since
it
is
forbidden
by
law
to
export
its
down
lest
it
should
hurt
the
fur
trade
in
the
manufacture
of
hats
its
only
present
use
is
to
furnish
the
negroes
with
canoes
which
are
hollowed
out
of
its
immense
trunks
i
am
as
yet
so
much
enchanted
with
the
country
that
it
would
require
no
very
strong
additional
inducements
to
make
me
establish
myself
here
altogether
and
in
that
case
my
first
care
would
be
to
build
for
myself
a
cottage
among
these
mountains
in
which
i
might
pass
the
sultry
months
e
ma
il
bruno
il
bel
non
january
as
i
was
returning
this
morning
from
montego
bay
about
a
mile
from
my
own
estate
a
figure
presented
itself
before
me
i
really
think
the
most
picturesque
that
i
ever
beheld
it
was
a
mulatto
girl
born
upon
cornwall
but
whom
the
overseer
of
a
neighbouring
estate
had
obtained
my
permission
to
exchange
for
another
slave
as
well
as
two
little
children
whom
she
had
borne
to
him
but
as
yet
he
has
been
unable
to
procure
a
substitute
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
purchasing
single
negroes
and
mary
wiggins
is
still
my
slave
however
as
she
is
considered
as
being
manumitted
she
had
not
dared
to
present
herself
at
cornwall
on
my
arrival
lest
she
should
have
been
considered
as
an
intruder
but
she
now
threw
herself
in
my
way
to
tell
me
how
glad
she
was
to
see
me
for
that
she
had
always
thought
till
now
which
is
the
general
complaint
that
had
no
and
also
to
obtain
a
regular
invitation
to
my
negro
festival
tomorrow
by
this
universal
complaint
it
appears
that
while
wilberforce
is
lamenting
their
hard
fate
in
being
subject
to
a
master
greatest
fear
is
the
not
having
a
master
whom
they
know
and
that
to
be
told
by
the
negroes
of
another
estate
that
they
belong
to
no
massa
is
one
of
the
most
contemptuous
reproaches
that
can
be
cast
upon
them
poor
creatures
when
they
happened
to
hear
on
wednesday
evening
that
my
carriage
was
ordered
for
montego
bay
the
next
morning
they
fancied
that
i
was
going
away
for
good
and
all
and
came
up
to
the
house
in
such
a
hubbub
that
my
agent
was
obliged
to
speak
to
them
and
pacify
them
with
the
assurance
that
i
should
come
back
on
friday
without
fail
but
to
return
to
mary
wiggins
she
was
much
too
pretty
not
to
obtain
her
invitation
to
cornwall
on
the
contrary
i
upon
her
coming
and
bade
her
tell
her
that
i
admired
his
taste
very
much
for
having
chosen
her
i
really
think
that
her
form
and
features
were
the
most
that
i
ever
met
with
her
complexion
had
no
yellow
in
it
and
yet
was
not
brown
enough
to
be
dark
it
was
more
of
an
colour
than
any
thing
else
her
teeth
were
admirable
both
for
colour
and
shape
her
eyes
equally
mild
and
bright
and
her
face
merely
broad
enough
to
give
it
all
possible
softness
and
grandness
of
contour
her
air
and
countenance
would
have
suited
yarico
but
she
reminded
me
most
of
grassini
in
la
vergine
del
sole
only
that
mary
wiggins
was
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
and
that
instead
of
a
white
robe
she
wore
a
mixed
dress
of
brown
white
and
dead
yellow
which
harmonised
excellently
well
with
her
complexion
while
one
of
her
beautiful
arms
was
thrown
across
her
brow
to
shade
her
eyes
and
a
profusion
of
rings
on
her
fingers
glittered
in
the
sunbeams
mary
wiggins
and
an
old
are
the
most
picturesque
objects
that
i
have
seen
for
these
twenty
years
on
my
arrival
at
home
my
agent
made
me
a
very
elegant
little
present
of
a
scorpion
and
a
couple
of
centipedes
the
first
was
given
to
him
but
the
large
centipede
he
had
shaken
out
of
a
book
last
night
and
having
immediately
covered
her
up
in
a
phial
of
rum
he
found
this
morning
that
she
had
produced
a
young
one
which
was
lying
drowned
by
her
side
i
find
that
my
negroes
were
called
away
from
their
attention
to
the
works
yesterday
evening
for
the
crop
is
now
making
with
the
greatest
activity
and
kept
up
all
night
by
a
fire
at
a
neighbouring
estate
on
these
occasions
a
is
blown
and
all
the
negroes
of
the
adjoining
plantations
hasten
to
give
their
assistance
on
this
occasion
the
fire
was
extinguished
with
the
loss
of
only
five
negro
houses
but
this
is
a
heavy
concern
to
the
poor
negro
proprietors
who
have
lost
in
it
their
whole
stock
of
clothes
and
furniture
and
finery
which
they
had
been
accumulating
for
years
and
to
which
their
attachment
is
excessive
landing
when
first
i
gain
d
the
atlantic
shore
and
bade
farewell
to
ocean
s
roar
what
gracious
power
my
bosom
eased
my
senses
soothed

fancy
pleased
and
bade
me
feel

no

made

rejoice
a

sweet
words
in
that
sweet
voice
january
this
was
the
day
given
to
my
negroes
as
a
festival
on
my
arrival
a
couple
of
heifers
were
slaughtered
for
them
they
were
allowed
as
much
rum
and
sugar
and
noise
and
dancing
as
they
chose
and
as
to
the
two
latter
certainly
they
profited
by
the
permission
about
two
o
clock
they
began
to
assemble
round
the
house
all
drest
in
their
holiday
clothes
which
both
for
men
and
women
were
chiefly
white
only
that
the
women
were
decked
out
with
a
profusion
of
beads
and
corals
and
gold
ornaments
of
all
descriptions
and
that
while
the
blacks
wore
jackets
the
mulattoes
generally
wore
cloth
coats
and
inasmuch
as
they
were
all
plainly
clean
instead
of
being
shabbily
fashionable
and
affected
to
be
nothing
except
that
which
they
really
were
they
looked
twenty
times
more
like
gentlemen
than
nine
tenths
of
the
bankers
clerks
who
swagger
up
and
down
bond
street
it
is
a
custom
as
to
the
mulatto
children
that
the
males
born
on
an
estate
should
never
be
employed
as
field
negroes
but
as
tradesmen
the
females
are
brought
up
as
domestics
about
the
house
i
had
particularly
invited
mr
which
i
found
to
be
the
polite
manner
in
which
the
negroes
spoke
of
him
and
there
arrived
a
couple
of
very
gay
and
gaudy
ones
i
enquired
whether
one
of
them
was
but
i
was
told
that
was
s
rival
and
enemy
and
might
belong
to
the
factions
of
the
blues
and
the
reds
but
on
cornwall
they
were
all
friends
and
therefore
there
were
only
the
father
and
the
son
senior
and
junior
the
person
who
gave
me
this
information
was
a
young
mulatto
carpenter
called
nicholas
whom
i
had
noticed
in
the
crowd
on
my
first
arrival
for
his
clean
appearance
and
intelligent
countenance
and
he
now
begged
me
to
notice
the
smaller
of
the
two
machines
to
be
sure
he
said
it
was
not
so
large
nor
so
showy
as
the
other
but
then
it
was
much
better
his
own
word
and
altogether
much
prettier
and
he
said
so
much
in
praise
of
it
that
i
asked
him
whether
he
knew
the
maker
and
then
out
came
the
motive
oh
yes
it
was
made
by
john
fuller
who
lived
in
the
next
house
to
him
and
worked
in
the
same
shop
and
indeed
they
were
just
like
so
i
desired
to
see
his
and
he
brought
me
as
smart
and
intelligent
a
little
fellow
as
eye
ever
beheld
who
came
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
to
tell
me
that
he
had
made
every
bit
of
the
canoe
with
his
own
hands
and
had
set
to
work
upon
it
the
moment
that
he
knew
of
massa
s
coming
to
jamaica
and
indeed
it
was
as
fine
as
paint
pasteboard
gilt
paper
and
could
make
it
unluckily
the
breeze
being
very
strong
blew
off
a
fine
glittering
umbrella
surmounted
with
a
plume
of
john
crow
feathers
which
crowned
the
top
and
a
little
wag
of
a
negro
boy
whipped
it
up
clapped
it
upon
his
head
and
performed
the
part
of
an
impromptu
with
so
much
fun
and
grotesqueness
that
he
fairly
beat
the
original
performers
out
of
the
pit
and
carried
off
all
the
applause
of
the
spectators
and
a
couple
of
my
dollars
the
are
fitted
out
at
the
expense
of
the
rich
negroes
who
afterwards
share
the
money
collected
from
the
spectators
during
their
performance
allotting
one
share
to
the
representator
himself
and
it
is
usual
for
the
master
of
the
estate
to
give
them
a
couple
of
guineas
apiece
this
nicholas
whom
i
mentioned
is
a
very
interesting
person
both
from
his
good
looks
and
gentle
manners
and
from
his
story
he
is
the
son
of
a
white
man
who
on
his
charged
his
nephew
and
heir
to
purchase
the
freedom
of
this
natural
child
the
nephew
had
promised
to
do
so
i
had
consented
nothing
was
necessary
but
to
find
the
substitute
which
now
is
no
easy
matter
when
about
six
months
ago
the
nephew
broke
his
neck
and
the
property
went
to
a
distant
relation
application
in
behalf
of
poor
nicholas
has
been
made
to
the
heir
and
i
heartily
hope
that
he
will
enable
me
to
release
him
i
felt
strongly
tempted
to
set
him
at
liberty
at
once
but
if
i
were
to
begin
in
that
way
there
would
be
no
stopping
and
it
would
be
doing
a
kindness
to
an
individual
at
the
expense
of
all
my
other
negroes
others
would
expect
the
same
and
then
i
must
either
contrive
to
cultivate
my
estate
with
fewer
hands
or
must
cease
to
cultivate
it
altogether
and
from
inability
to
maintain
them
send
my
negroes
to
seek
bread
for
themselves
which
as
two
thirds
of
them
have
been
born
upon
the
estate
and
many
of
them
are
lame
dropsical
and
of
a
great
age
would
of
all
misfortunes
that
could
happen
to
them
be
the
most
cruel
even
when
nicholas
was
speaking
to
me
about
his
liberty
he
said
it
is
not
that
i
wish
to
go
away
sir
it
is
only
for
the
name
and
honour
of
being
free
but
i
would
always
stay
here
and
be
your
servant
and
i
had
rather
be
an
on
cornwall
than
a
head
carpenter
any
where
possibly
this
was
all
palaver
in
which
the
negroes
are
great
dealers
but
at
least
he
to
be
sincere
and
i
was
heartily
grieved
that
i
could
not
allow
myself
to
say
more
to
him
than
that
i
sincerely
wished
him
to
get
his
liberty
and
would
receive
the
very
lowest
exchange
for
him
that
common
prudence
would
authorize
and
even
for
those
few
kind
words
the
poor
fellow
seemed
to
think
it
impossible
to
find
means
strong
enough
to
express
his
gratitude
nor
is
this
the
only
instance
in
which
nicholas
has
been
unlucky
it
seems
that
he
was
the
first
lover
of
the
beautiful
psyche
whom
i
had
noticed
on
my
arrival
this
evening
after
the
performance
of
the
i
desired
to
see
some
of
the
girls
dance
and
by
general
acclamation
psyche
was
brought
forward
to
exhibit
she
being
avowedly
the
best
dancer
on
the
estate
and
certainly
nothing
could
be
more
light
graceful
easy
and
spirited
than
her
performance
she
perfectly
answered
the
description
of
sallust
s
sempronia
who
was
said
sal
tare
elegantius
quam
necesse
est
probæ
et
cui
cariora
semper
omnia
quam
decus
et
pudicitia
when
her
dance
was
over
i
called
her
to
me
and
gave
her
a
handful
of
silver
ah
psyche
said
nicholas
who
was
standing
at
my
elbow
massa
no
give
you
all
that
if
massa
know
you
so
bad
girl
she
run
away
from
me
massa
psyche
gave
him
a
kind
of
pouting
look
half
kind
and
half
reproachful
and
turned
away
and
then
he
told
me
that
psyche
had
been
his
wife
of
his
wives
he
should
have
said
that
he
had
had
a
child
by
her
and
then
she
had
left
him
for
one
of
my
white
people
as
they
call
the
because
he
had
a
good
salary
and
could
afford
to
give
her
more
presents
than
a
slave
could
was
there
not
another
reason
for
your
quarrelling
said
my
agent
was
there
not
a
shade
of
colour
too
much
oh
massa
answered
nicholas
the
child
is
not
my
own
that
is
certain
it
is
a
black
man
s
child
but
still
i
will
always
take
care
of
the
child
because
it
have
no
friends
and
me
wish
make
it
good
neger
for
massa
and
take
good
care
of
it
too
he
added
throwing
his
arm
round
the
waist
of
a
woman
rather
in
years
she
my
wife
too
massa
long
ago
old
now
and
sick
but
always
good
to
me
so
i
still
live
with
her
and
will
never
leave
her
never
massa
she
polly
s
mother
polly
is
a
pretty
girl
nursing
a
young
child
she
belongs
to
the
and
seems
to
think
it
as
necessary
a
part
of
her
duty
to
nurse
as
the
child
to
be
sure
she
has
not
as
yet
insisted
upon
suckling
me
but
if
i
open
a
in
the
evening
polly
walks
in
and
shuts
it
without
saying
a
word
oh
don
t
shut
the
window
not
good
for
massa
and
she
shuts
the
casement
without
mercy
i
am
drinking
orangeade
or
some
such
liquid
polly
walks
up
to
the
table
and
seizes
it
leave
that
jug
polly
i
am
dying
with
more
hurt
massa
and
away
go
polly
and
the
orangeade
so
that
i
begin
to
fancy
myself
sancho
in
barataria
and
that
polly
is
the
señor
doctor
pedro
in
petticoats
the
difference
of
colour
which
had
offended
nicholas
so
much
in
psyche
s
child
is
a
fault
which
no
mulatto
will
pardon
nor
can
the
separation
of
castes
in
india
be
more
rigidly
observed
than
that
of
complexional
shades
among
the
creoles
my
black
page
cubina
is
married
i
told
him
that
i
hoped
he
had
married
a
pretty
woman
why
had
he
not
married
mary
wiggins
he
seemed
quite
shocked
at
the
very
idea
oh
massa
me
black
mary
wiggins
sambo
that
not
the
dances
performed
seldom
admitted
more
than
three
persons
at
a
time
to
me
they
appeared
to
be
movements
entirely
dictated
by
the
caprice
of
the
moment
but
i
am
told
that
there
is
a
regular
figure
and
that
the
least
mistake
or
a
single
false
step
is
immediately
noticed
by
the
rest
i
could
indeed
sometimes
fancy
that
one
story
represented
an
old
duenna
guarding
a
girl
from
a
lover
and
another
the
pursuit
of
a
young
woman
by
two
suitors
the
one
young
and
the
other
old
but
this
might
be
only
fancy
however
i
am
told
that
they
have
dances
which
not
only
represent
courtship
and
marriage
but
being
brought
to
bed
their
music
consisted
of
nothing
but
gambys
eboe
drums
and
the
latter
is
nothing
but
any
flat
piece
of
board
beat
upon
with
two
sticks
and
the
former
is
a
bladder
with
a
parcel
of
pebbles
in
it
but
the
principal
part
of
the
music
to
which
they
dance
is
vocal
one
girl
generally
singing
two
lines
by
herself
and
being
answered
by
a
chorus
to
make
out
either
the
rhyme
of
the
air
or
meaning
of
the
words
was
out
of
the
question
but
one
very
long
song
was
about
the
duke
of
wellington
every
stanza
being
chorussed
with
ay
waterloo
waterloo
ho
ho
ho
too
had
a
great
deal
to
do
in
the
business
for
every
third
word
was
massa
though
how
i
came
there
i
have
no
more
idea
than
the
duke
the
singing
began
about
six
o
clock
and
lasted
without
a
moment
s
pause
till
two
in
the
morning
and
such
a
noise
never
did
i
hear
till
then
the
whole
of
the
floor
which
was
not
taken
up
by
the
dancers
was
through
every
part
of
the
house
except
the
occupied
by
men
women
and
children
fast
asleep
but
although
they
were
allowed
rum
and
sugar
by
whole
pailfuls
and
were
most
of
them
in
consequence
there
was
not
one
of
them
drunk
except
indeed
one
person
and
that
was
an
old
woman
who
sang
and
shouted
and
tossed
herself
about
in
an
elbow
chair
till
she
tumbled
it
over
and
rolled
about
the
room
in
a
manner
which
shocked
the
delicacy
of
even
the
least
prudish
part
of
the
company
at
twelve
my
agent
wanted
to
dismiss
them
but
i
would
not
suffer
them
to
be
interrupted
on
the
first
holiday
that
i
had
given
them
so
they
continued
to
dance
and
shout
till
two
when
human
nature
could
bear
no
more
and
they
left
me
to
my
bed
and
a
violent
headache
january
sunday
in
spite
of
their
exertions
of
last
night
the
negroes
were
again
with
me
by
two
o
clock
in
the
day
with
their
drums
and
their
chorusses
however
they
found
themselves
unable
to
keep
it
up
as
they
had
done
on
the
former
night
and
were
content
to
withdraw
to
their
own
houses
by
ten
in
the
evening
but
first
they
requested
to
have
tomorrow
to
themselves
in
order
that
they
might
go
to
the
mountains
for
provisions
for
although
their
cottages
are
always
surrounded
with
trees
and
shrubs
their
provision
grounds
are
kept
quite
distinct
and
are
at
a
distance
among
the
mountains
of
course
i
made
no
difficulty
of
acceding
to
their
request
but
upon
condition
that
they
should
ask
for
no
more
holidays
till
the
crop
should
be
completed
for
the
purpose
of
cultivating
their
they
are
allowed
every
saturday
but
on
the
occasion
of
my
arrival
they
obtained
permission
to
have
the
saturday
to
themselves
and
to
fetch
their
week
s
provisions
from
the
mountains
on
the
following
monday
all
the
slaves
maintain
themselves
in
this
manner
by
their
own
labour
even
the
domestic
attendants
are
not
exempted
but
are
expected
to
feed
themselves
except
stated
allowances
of
salt
fish
salt
pork
january
i
really
believe
that
the
negresses
can
produce
children
at
pleasure
and
where
they
are
barren
it
is
just
as
hens
will
frequently
not
lay
eggs
on
shipboard
because
they
do
not
like
their
situation
cubina
s
wife
is
in
a
family
way
and
i
told
him
that
if
the
child
should
live
i
would
christen
it
for
him
if
he
wished
it
tank
you
kind
massa
me
like
it
very
much
much
oblige
if
massa
do
that
for
so
i
promised
to
baptize
the
father
and
the
baby
on
the
same
day
and
said
that
i
would
be
godfather
to
any
children
that
might
be
born
on
the
estate
during
my
residence
in
jamaica
this
was
soon
spread
about
and
although
i
have
not
yet
been
here
a
week
two
women
are
in
the
straw
already
jug
betty
and
minerva
the
first
is
wife
to
my
head
driver
the
duke
of
sully
but
my
sense
of
propriety
was
much
gratified
at
finding
that
minerva
s
husband
was
called
captain
i
think
nobody
will
be
able
to
accuse
me
of
neglecting
the
religious
education
of
my
negroes
for
i
have
not
only
promised
to
baptize
all
the
infants
but
meeting
a
little
black
boy
this
morning
who
said
that
his
name
was
moses
i
gave
him
a
piece
of
silver
and
told
him
that
it
was
for
the
sake
of
aaron
which
i
flatter
myself
was
planting
in
his
young
mind
the
rudiments
of
christianity
in
my
evening
s
drive
i
met
the
negroes
returning
from
the
mountains
with
baskets
of
provisions
sufficient
to
last
them
for
the
week
by
law
they
are
only
allowed
every
other
saturday
for
the
purpose
of
cultivating
their
own
grounds
which
indeed
is
sufficient
but
by
giving
them
every
alternate
saturday
into
the
bargain
it
enables
them
to
perform
their
task
with
so
much
ease
as
almost
converts
it
into
an
amusement
and
the
frequent
visiting
their
grounds
makes
them
grow
habitually
as
much
attached
to
them
as
they
are
to
their
houses
and
gardens
it
is
also
adviseable
for
them
to
bring
home
only
a
week
s
provisions
at
a
time
rather
than
a
fortnight
s
for
they
are
so
thoughtless
and
improvident
that
when
they
find
themselves
in
possession
of
a
larger
supply
than
is
requisite
for
their
immediate
occasions
they
will
sell
half
to
the
wandering
higglers
or
at
savanna
la
mar
in
exchange
for
spirits
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
week
they
find
themselves
entirely
unprovided
with
food
and
come
to
beg
a
supply
from
the
master
s
storehouse
january
the
sensitive
plant
is
a
great
nuisance
in
jamaica
it
the
pastures
and
being
armed
with
very
strong
sharp
prickles
it
wounds
the
mouths
of
the
cattle
and
in
some
places
makes
it
quite
impossible
for
them
to
feed
various
endeavours
have
been
made
to
eradicate
this
inconvenient
weed
but
none
as
yet
have
proved
effectual
january
the
houses
here
are
generally
built
and
arranged
according
to
one
and
the
same
model
my
own
is
of
wood
partly
raised
upon
pillars
it
consists
of
a
single
floor
a
long
gallery
called
a
piazza
terminated
at
each
end
by
a
square
room
runs
the
whole
length
of
the
house
on
each
side
of
the
piazza
is
a
range
of
and
the
porticoes
of
the
two
fronts
form
two
more
rooms
with
balustrades
and
flights
of
steps
descending
to
the
lawn
the
whole
house
is
virandoed
with
shifting
venetian
blinds
to
admit
air
except
that
one
of
the
end
rooms
has
on
account
of
the
rains
which
when
they
arrive
are
so
heavy
and
shift
with
the
wind
so
suddenly
from
the
one
side
to
the
other
that
all
the
blinds
are
obliged
to
be
kept
closed
consequently
the
whole
house
is
in
total
darkness
during
their
continuance
except
the
single
room
there
is
nothing
underneath
except
a
few
and
a
kind
of
but
none
of
the
domestic
negroes
sleep
in
the
house
all
going
home
at
night
to
their
respective
cottages
and
families
cornwall
house
itself
stands
on
a
dead
flat
and
the
works
are
built
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
for
the
convenience
of
their
being
the
more
under
the
agent
s
personal
inspection
a
point
of
material
consequence
with
them
all
but
more
particularly
for
the
hospital
this
dead
flat
is
only
ornamented
with
a
few
scattered
and
cotton
trees
a
grove
of
mangoes
and
the
branch
of
a
small
river
which
turns
the
mill
several
of
these
buildings
are
ugly
enough
but
the
shops
of
the
cooper
carpenter
and
blacksmith
some
of
the
trees
in
their
vicinity
and
the
embowered
in
shrubberies
and
groves
of
oranges
plantains
cocoas
and
would
be
reckoned
picturesque
in
the
most
ornamented
grounds
a
large
spreading
tamarind

me
at
this
moment
and
overshadows
the
stables
which
are
formed
of
open
wickerwork
and
an
loaded
with
fruit
grows
against
the
window
at
which
i
am
writing
on
three
sides
of
the
landscape
the
prospect
is
bounded
by
lofty
purple
mountains
and
the
variety
of
occupations
going
on
all
around
me
and
at
the
same
time
give
an
inconceivable
air
of
life
and
animation
to
the
whole
scene
especially
as
all
those
occupations
look
clean
even
those
which
in
england
look
dirty
all
the
tradespeople
are
dressed
either
in
white
jackets
and
trousers
or
with
stripes
of
red
and
one
band
of
negroes
are
carrying
the
ripe
canes
on
their
heads
to
the
mill
another
set
are
conveying
away
the
after
the
juice
has
been
extracted
flocks
of
turkeys
are
sheltering
from
the
heat
under
the
trees
the
river
is
filled
with
ducks
and
geese
the
coopers
and
carpenters
are
employed
about
the
puncheons
carts
drawn
some
by
six
others
by
eight
oxen
are
bringing
loads
of
indian
corn
from
the
fields
the
black
children
are
employed
in
gathering
it
into
the
granary
and
in
quarrelling
with
pigs
as
black
as
themselves
who
are
equally
busy
in
stealing
the
corn
whenever
the
children
are
looking
another
way
in
short
a
plantation
possesses
all
the
movement
and
interest
of
a
farm
without
its
dung
and
its
stench
and
its
dirty
accompaniments
january
i
saw
the
whole
process
of
this
morning
the
ripe
canes
are
brought
in
bundles
to
the
mill
where
the
cleanest
of
the
women
are
appointed
one
to
put
them
into
the
machine
for
grinding
them
and
another
to
draw
them
out
after
the
juice
has
been
extracted
when
she
throws
them
into
an
opening
in
the
floor
close
to
her
another
band
of
negroes
collects
them
below
when
under
the
name
of
they
are
carried
away
to
serve
for
fuel
the
juice
which
is
itself
at
first
of
a
pale
gushes
out
in
great
streams
quite
white
with
foam
and
passes
through
a
wooden
gutter
into
the
where
it
is
received
into
the
siphon
or
cock
where
fire
is
applied
to
it
and
it
is
slaked
with
lime
in
order
to
make
it
granulate
the
feculent
parts
of
it
rise
to
the
top
while
the
purer
and
more
fluid
flow
through
another
gutter
into
the
second
copper
when
little
but
the
impure
scum
on
the
surface
remains
to
be
drawn
off
the
first
gutter
communicating
with
the
copper
is
stopped
and
the
grosser
parts
are
obliged
to
find
a
new
course
through
another
gutter
which
conveys
them
to
the
distillery
where
being
mixed
with
the
molasses
or
treacle
they
are
manufactured
into
rum
from
the
second
copper
they
are
transmitted
into
the
first
and
thence
into
two
others
and
in
these
four
latter
basins
the
scum
is
removed
with
skimmers
pierced
with
holes
till
it
becomes
sufficiently
free
from
impurities
to
be
that
is
to
be
again
ladled
out
of
the
coppers
and
spread
into
the
coolers
where
it
is
left
to
granulate
the
sugar
is
then
formed
and
is
removed
into
the
where
it
is
put
into
hogsheads
and
left
to
settle
for
a
certain
time
during
which
those
parts
which
are
too
poor
and
too
liquid
to
granulate
drip
from
the
casks
into
vessels
placed
beneath
them
these
drippings
are
the
molasses
which
being
carried
into
the
distillery
and
mixed
with
the
coarser
scum
formerly
mentioned
form
that
mixture
from
which
the
spirituous
liquor
of
sugar
is
afterwards
produced
by
fermentation
when
but
once
distilled
it
is
called
low
wine
and
it
is
not
till
after
it
has
gone
through
a
second
distillation
that
it
acquires
the
name
of
rum
the
trash
used
for
fuel
consists
of
the
empty
canes
that
which
is
employed
for
fodder
and
for
thatching
is
furnished
by
the
superabundant
after
so
many
have
been
set
apart
as
are
required
for
planting
after
these
original
plants
have
been
cut
their
roots
throw
up
suckers
which
in
time
become
canes
and
are
called
they
are
far
inferior
in
juice
to
the
planted
canes
but
then
on
the
other
hand
they
require
much
less
weeding
and
spare
the
negroes
the
only
laborious
part
of
the
business
of
the
digging
holes
for
the
plants
therefore
although
an
acre
of
ratoons
will
produce
but
one
hogshead
of
sugar
while
an
acre
of
plants
will
produce
two
the
superiority
of
the
ratooned
piece
is
very
great
inasmuch
as
the
saving
of
time
and
labour
will
enable
the
proprietor
to
cultivate
five
acres
of
ratoons
in
the
same
time
with
one
of
plants
unluckily
after
three
crops
or
five
at
the
utmost
in
general
the
ratoons
are
totally
exhausted
and
you
are
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
fresh
plants
last
night
a
poor
man
named
charles
who
had
been
coachman
to
my
uncle
ages
ago
was
brought
into
the
hospital
having
missed
a
step
in
the
and
plunged
his
foot
into
the
siphon
fortunately
the
fire
had
not
long
been
kindled
and
though
the
liquor
was
hot
enough
to
scald
him
it
was
not
sufficiently
so
to
do
him
any
material
injury
the
old
man
had
presented
himself
to
me
on
saturday
s
holiday
or
in
the
negro
dialect
and
had
shown
me
with
great
exultation
the
coat
and
waistcoat
which
had
been
the
last
present
of
his
old
massa
charles
is
now
my
chief
mason
and
as
one
of
the
principal
persons
on
the
estate
was
entitled
by
old
custom
to
the
compliment
of
a
dollar
on
my
arrival
but
at
the
same
time
that
i
gave
him
the
dollar
to
which
his
situation
entitled
him
i
gave
him
another
for
himself
as
a
keepsake
he
put
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
old
massa
s
waistcoat
and
assured
me
that
they
should
never
again
be
separated
on
hearing
of
his
accident
i
went
over
to
the
hospital
to
see
that
he
was
well
taken
care
of
and
immediately
the
poor
fellow
began
talking
to
me
about
my
grandfather
and
his
young
massa
and
the
young
missies
his
sisters
and
while
i
suffered
him
to
chatter
away
for
an
hour
he
totally
forgot
the
pain
of
his
burnt
leg
it
was
particularly
agreeable
to
me
to
observe
on
saturday
as
a
proof
of
the
good
treatment
which
they
had
experienced
so
many
old
servants
of
the
family
many
of
whom
had
been
born
on
the
estate
and
who
though
turned
of
sixty
and
seventy
were
still
strong
healthy
and
cheerful
many
manumitted
negroes
also
came
from
other
parts
of
the
country
to
this
festival
on
hearing
of
my
arrival
because
as
they
said
if
they
did
not
come
to
see
massa
they
were
afraid
that
it
would
look
ungrateful
and
as
if
they
cared
no
longer
about
him
and
cornwall
now
that
they
were
so
they
stayed
two
or
three
days
on
the
estate
coming
up
to
the
house
for
their
dinners
and
going
to
sleep
at
night
among
their
friends
in
their
own
former
habitations
the
negro
huts
and
when
they
went
away
they
assured
me
that
nothing
should
prevent
their
coming
back
to
bid
me
farewell
before
i
left
the
island
all
this
may
be
palaver
but
certainly
they
at
least
play
their
parts
with
such
an
air
of
truth
and
warmth
and
enthusiasm
that
after
the
cold
hearts
and
repulsive
manners
of
england
the
contrast
is
infinitely
agreeable
je
ne
vois
que
des
yeux
toujours
prêts
à
i
find
it
quite
impossible
to
resist
the
fascination
of
the
conscious
pleasure
of
pleasing
and
my
own
heart
which
i
have
so
long
been
obliged
to
keep
closed
seems
to
expand
itself
again
in
the
sunshine
of
the
kind
looks
and
words
which
meet
me
at
every
turn
and
seem
to
wait
for
mine
as
anxiously
as
if
they
were
so
many
diamonds
january
in
the
year
this
parish
of
westmoreland
was
kept
in
a
perpetual
state
of
alarm
by
a
runaway
negro
called
who
had
established
himself
among
the
moreland
mountains
and
collected
a
troop
of
banditti
of
which
he
was
himself
the
chief
he
robbed
very
often
and
murdered
occasionally
but
gallantry
was
his
every
day
occupation
indeed
being
a
remarkably
tall
athletic
young
fellow
among
the
beauties
of
his
own
complexion
he
found
but
few
lucretias
and
his
retreat
in
the
mountains
was
as
well
furnished
as
the
haram
of
constantinople
every
handsome
negress
who
had
the
slightest
cause
of
complaint
against
her
master
took
the
first
opportunity
of
eloping
to
join
where
she
found
freedom
protection
and
unbounded
generosity
for
he
spared
no
pains
to
secure
their
affections
by
gratifying
their
vanity
indeed
no
creole
lady
could
venture
out
on
a
visit
without
running
the
risk
of
having
her
bandbox
run
away
with
by
plato
for
the
decoration
of
his
sultanas
and
if
the
maid
who
carried
the
bandbox
happened
to
be
he
ran
away
with
the
maid
as
well
as
the
bandbox
every
endeavour
to
seize
this
desperado
was
long
in
vain
a
large
reward
was
put
upon
his
head
but
no
negro
dared
to
approach
him
for
besides
his
acknowledged
courage
he
was
a
professor
of
obi
and
had
threatened
that
whoever
dared
to
lay
a
finger
upon
him
should
suffer
spiritual
torments
as
well
as
be
physically
shot
through
the
head
unluckily
for
plato
rum
was
an
article
with
him
of
the
first
necessity
the
which
was
kept
for
him
was
too
vigilant
to
admit
of
his
purchasing
spirituous
liquors
for
himself
and
once
when
for
that
purpose
he
had
ventured
into
the
neighbourhood
of
montego
bay
he
was
recognised
by
a
slave
who
immediately
gave
the
alarm
unfortunately
for
this
poor
fellow
whose
name
was
taffy
at
that
moment
all
his
companions
happened
to
be
out
of
hearing
and
after
the
first
moment
s
alarm
finding
that
no
one
approached
the
exasperated
robber
rushed
upon
him
and
lifted
the
with
which
he
was
armed
for
the
purpose
of
cleaving
his
skull
taffy
fled
for
it
but
plato
was
the
younger
the
stronger
and
the
swifter
of
the
two
and
gained
upon
him
every
moment
taffy
however
on
the
other
hand
possessed
that
one
quality
by
which
according
to
the
fable
the
cat
was
enabled
to
save
herself
from
the
hounds
when
the
fox
with
his
thousand
tricks
was
caught
by
them
he
was
an
admirable
climber
an
art
in
which
plato
possessed
no
skill
and
a
tree
which
is
remarkably
difficult
of
ascent
presenting
itself
before
him
in
a
few
moments
taffy
was
bawling
for
help
from
the
very
top
of
it
to
reach
him
was
impossible
for
his
enemy
but
still
his
destruction
was
hard
at
hand
for
plato
began
to
hack
the
tree
with
his
bill
and
it
was
evident
that
a
very
short
space
of
time
would
be
sufficient
to
level
it
with
the
ground
in
this
dilemma
taffy
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
break
off
the
branches
near
him
and
he
contrived
to
pelt
these
so
dexterously
at
the
head
of
his
assailant
that
he
fairly
kept
him
at
bay
till
his
cries
at
length
reached
the
ears
of
his
companions
and
their
approach
compelled
the
once
more
to
seek
safety
among
the
mountains
after
this
plato
no
longer
dared
to
approach
montego
town
but
still
spirits
must
be
had
how
was
he
to
obtain
them
there
was
an
old
watchman
on
the
outskirts
of
the
estate
of
canaan
with
whom
he
had
contracted
an
acquaintance
and
frequently
had
passed
the
night
in
his
hut
the
old
man
having
been
equally
induced
by
his
presents
and
by
dread
of
his
corporeal
strength
and
supposed
supernatural
power
to
profess
the
warmest
attachment
to
the
interests
of
his
terrible
friend
to
this
man
plato
at
length
resolved
to
entrust
himself
he
gave
him
money
to
purchase
spirits
and
appointed
a
particular
day
when
he
would
come
to
receive
them
the
reward
placed
upon
the
robber
s
head
was
more
than
either
gratitude
or
terror
could
counterbalance
and
on
the
same
day
when
the
watchman
set
out
to
purchase
the
rum
he
apprised
two
of
his
friends
at
canaan
for
whose
use
it
was
intended
and
advised
to
take
the
opportunity
of
obtaining
the
reward
the
two
negroes
posted
themselves
in
proper
time
near
the
watchman
s
hut
most
unwisely
instead
of
sending
down
some
of
his
gang
they
saw
plato
in
his
full
confidence
in
the
friendship
of
his
confidant
arrive
himself
and
enter
the
cabin
but
so
great
was
their
alarm
at
seeing
this
dreadful
personage
that
they
remained
in
their
concealment
nor
dared
to
make
an
attempt
at
seizing
him
the
spirits
were
delivered
to
the
robber
he
might
have
retired
with
them
unmolested
but
in
his
rashness
and
his
eagerness
to
taste
the
liquor
of
which
he
had
so
long
been
deprived
he
opened
the
flagon
and
swallowed
draught
after
draught
till
he
sunk
upon
the
ground
in
a
state
of
complete
insensibility
the
watchman
then
summoned
the
two
negroes
from
their
concealment
who
bound
his
arms
and
conveyed
him
to
montego
bay
where
he
was
immediately
sentenced
to
execution
he
died
most
heroically
kept
up
the
terrors
of
his
imposture
to
his
last
moment
told
the
magistrates
who
condemned
him
that
his
death
should
be
revenged
by
a
storm
which
would
lay
waste
the
whole
island
that
year
and
when
his
negro
gaoler
was
binding
him
to
the
stake
at
which
he
was
destined
to
suffer
he
assured
him
that
he
should
not
live
long
to
triumph
in
his
death
for
that
he
had
taken
good
care
to
obeah
him
before
his
quitting
the
prison
it
certainly
did
happen
strangely
enough
that
before
the
year
was
over
the
most
violent
storm
took
place
ever
known
in
jamaica
and
as
to
the
gaoler
his
imagination
was
so
forcibly
struck
by
the
threats
of
the
dying
man
that
although
every
care
was
taken
of
him
the
power
of
medicine
exhausted
and
even
a
voyage
to
america
undertaken
in
hopes
that
a
change
of
scene
might
change
the
course
of
his
ideas
still
from
the
moment
of
plato
s
death
he
gradually
pined
and
withered
away
and
finally
expired
before
the
completion
of
the
twelvemonth
the
belief
in
obeah
is
now
greatly
weakened
but
still
exists
in
some
degree
not
above
ten
months
ago
my
agent
was
informed
that
a
negro
of
very
suspicious
manners
and
appearance
was
harboured
by
some
of
my
people
on
the
mountain
lands
he
found
means
to
have
him
surprised
and
on
examination
there
was
found
upon
him
a
bag
containing
a
great
variety
of
strange
materials
for
incantations
such
as
cat
s
ears
the
feet
of
various
animals
human
hair
fish
bones
the
teeth
of
alligators
he
was
conveyed
to
montego
bay
and
no
sooner
was
it
understood
that
this
old
african
was
in
prison
than
depositions
were
poured
in
from
all
quarters
from
negroes
who
deposed
to
having
seen
him
exercise
his
magical
arts
and
in
particular
to
his
having
sold
such
and
such
slaves
medicines
and
charms
to
deliver
them
from
their
enemies
being
in
plain
english
nothing
else
than
rank
poisons
he
was
convicted
of
obeah
upon
the
most
indubitable
evidence
the
good
old
practice
of
burning
has
fallen
into
disrepute
so
he
was
sentenced
to
be
transported
and
was
shipped
off
the
island
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
persons
of
all
colours
white
black
and
yellow
january
throughout
the
island
many
estates
formerly
very
flourishing
and
productive
have
been
thrown
up
for
want
of
hands
to
cultivate
them
and
are
now
suffered
to
lie
waste
four
are
in
this
situation
in
my
own
immediate
neighbourhood
finding
their
complement
of
negroes
decrease
and
having
no
means
of
recruiting
them
proprietors
of
two
estates
have
in
numerous
instances
found
themselves
obliged
to
give
up
one
of
them
and
draw
off
the
negroes
for
the
purpose
of
properly
cultivating
the
other
i
have
just
had
an
instance
strikingly
convincing
of
the
extreme
nicety
required
in
rearing
negro
children
two
have
been
born
since
my
arrival
my
housekeeper
was
hardly
ever
out
of
the
apartment
i
always
visited
it
myself
once
a
day
and
sometimes
twice
in
order
that
i
might
be
certain
of
the
women
being
well
taken
care
of
not
a
day
passed
without
the
inspection
of
a
physician
nothing
of
indulgence
that
was
proper
for
them
was
denied
and
besides
their
ordinary
food
the
mothers
received
every
day
the
most
nourishing
and
palatable
dish
that
was
brought
to
my
own
table
add
to
this
that
the
women
themselves
were
creatures
and
particularly
anxious
to
rear
these
children
because
i
had
promised
to
be
their
godfather
myself
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
attention
and
indulgence
one
of
the
mothers
during
the
nurse
s
absence
for
ten
minutes
grew
alarmed
at
her
infant
s
apparent
sleepiness
to
rouse
it
she
began
dancing
and
shaking
it
till
it
was
in
a
strong
perspiration
and
then
she
stood
with
it
for
some
minutes
at
an
open
window
while
a
strong
north
wind
was
blowing
in
consequence
it
caught
cold
and
the
next
morning
symptoms
of
a
locked
jaw
showed
itself
the
poor
woman
was
the
image
of
grief
itself
she
sat
on
her
bed
looking
at
the
child
which
lay
by
her
side
with
its
little
hands
clasped
its
teeth
clenched
and
its
eyes
fixed
writhing
in
the
agony
of
the
spasm
while
she
was
herself
quite
motionless
and
speechless
although
the
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
incessantly
all
assistance
was
fruitless
her
thoughtlessness
for
five
minutes
had
killed
the
infant
and
at
noon
it
expired
this
woman
was
a
tender
mother
had
borne
ten
children
and
yet
has
now
but
one
alive
another
at
present
in
the
hospital
has
borne
seven
and
but
one
has
lived
to
puberty
and
the
instances
of
those
who
have
had
four
five
six
children
without
succeeding
in
bringing
up
one
in
spite
of
the
utmost
attention
and
indulgence
are
very
numerous
so
heedless
and
inattentive
are
the
mothers
and
so
subject
in
this
climate
are
infants
to
dangerous
complaints
the
locked
jaw
is
the
common
and
most
fatal
one
so
fatal
indeed
that
the
midwife
the
is
her
negro
appellation
told
me
the
other
day
oh
massa
till
nine
days
over
we
of
certainly
care
and
kindness
are
not
adequate
to
save
the
children
for
the
son
of
a
sovereign
could
not
have
been
more
anxiously
well
treated
than
was
the
poor
little
negro
who
died
this
morning
the
negroes
are
always
buried
in
their
own
gardens
and
many
strange
and
fantastical
ceremonies
are
observed
on
the
occasion
if
the
corpse
be
that
of
a
grown
person
they
consult
it
as
to
which
way
it
pleases
to
be
carried
and
they
make
attempts
upon
various
roads
without
success
before
they
can
hit
upon
the
right
one
till
that
is
accomplished
they
stagger
under
the
weight
of
the
coffin
struggle
against
its
force
which
draws
them
in
a
different
direction
from
that
in
which
they
had
settled
to
go
and
sometimes
in
the
contest
the
corpse
and
the
coffin
jump
off
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
but
if
as
is
frequently
the
case
any
person
is
suspected
of
having
hastened
the
catastrophe
the
corpse
will
then
refuse
to
go
any
road
but
the
one
which
passes
by
the
habitation
of
the
suspected
person
and
as
soon
as
it
approaches
his
house
no
human
power
is
equal
to
persuading
it
to
pass
as
the
negroes
are
extremely
superstitious
and
very
much
afraid
of
ghosts
whom
they
call
the
i
rather
wonder
at
their
choosing
to
have
their
dead
buried
in
their
gardens
but
i
understand
their
argument
to
be
that
they
need
only
fear
the
duppies
of
their
enemies
but
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
those
after
death
who
loved
them
in
their
lifetime
but
the
duppies
of
their
adversaries
are
very
alarming
beings
equally
powerful
by
day
as
by
night
and
who
not
only
are
spiritually
terrific
but
who
can
give
very
hard
substantial
knocks
on
the
pate
whenever
they
see
fit
occasion
and
can
find
a
good
opportunity
last
saturday
a
negro
was
brought
into
the
hospital
having
fallen
into
epileptic
fits
with
which
till
then
he
had
never
been
troubled
as
the
faintings
had
seized
him
at
the
and
the
fellow
was
an
african
it
was
at
first
supposed
by
his
companions
that
the
sight
and
smell
of
the
meat
had
affected
him
for
many
of
the
africans
can
not
endure
animal
food
of
any
kind
and
most
of
the
ebres
in
particular
are
made
ill
by
eating
turtle
even
although
they
can
use
any
other
food
without
injury
however
upon
enquiry
among
his
shipmates
it
appeared
that
he
had
frequently
eaten
beef
without
the
slightest
inconvenience
for
my
own
part
the
symptoms
of
his
complaint
were
such
as
to
make
me
suspect
him
of
having
tasted
something
poisonous
specially
as
just
before
his
first
fit
he
had
been
observed
in
the
small
grove
of
mangoes
near
the
house
but
i
was
assured
by
the
negroes
one
and
all
that
nothing
could
possibly
have
induced
him
to
eat
an
herb
or
fruit
from
that
grove
as
it
had
been
used
as
a
for
the
white
but
although
my
idea
of
the
poison
was
scouted
still
the
mention
of
the
suggested
another
cause
for
his
illness
to
the
negroes
and
they
had
no
sort
of
doubt
that
in
passing
through
the
he
had
been
struck
down
by
the
duppy
of
a
white
person
not
long
deceased
whom
he
had
formerly
offended
and
that
these
repeated
fainting
fits
were
the
consequence
of
that
ghostly
blow
the
negroes
have
in
various
publications
been
accused
of
a
total
want
of
religion
but
this
appears
to
me
quite
incompatible
with
the
ideas
of
spirits
existing
after
dissolution
of
the
body
which
necessarily
implies
a
belief
in
a
future
state
and
although
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
they
have
no
outward
forms
of
religion
the
most
devout
christian
can
not
have
god
bless
you
oftener
on
his
lips
than
the
negro
nor
on
the
other
hand
appear
to
feel
the
wish
for
their
enemy
s
damnation
more
sincerely
when
he
utters
it
the
africans
as
is
well
known
generally
believe
that
there
is
a
life
beyond
this
world
and
that
they
shall
enjoy
it
by
returning
to
their
own
country
and
this
idea
used
frequently
to
induce
them
soon
after
their
landing
in
the
colonies
to
commit
suicide
but
this
was
never
known
to
take
place
except
among
fresh
negroes
and
since
the
execrable
has
been
abolished
such
an
illusion
is
unheard
of
as
to
those
who
had
once
got
over
the
dreadful
period
of
seasoning
they
were
generally
soon
sensible
enough
of
the
amelioration
of
their
condition
to
make
the
idea
of
returning
to
africa
the
most
painful
that
could
be
presented
to
them
but
to
be
sure
poor
creatures
what
with
the
terrors
and
sufferings
of
the
voyage
and
the
unavoidable
hardships
of
the
seasoning
those
advantages
were
purchased
more
dearly
than
any
in
this
life
can
possibly
be
worth
god
be
thanked
all
that
is
now
at
an
end
and
certainly
as
far
as
i
can
as
yet
judge
if
i
were
now
standing
on
the
banks
of
virgil
s
lethe
with
a
goblet
of
the
waters
of
oblivion
in
my
hand
and
asked
whether
i
chose
to
enter
life
anew
as
an
english
labourer
or
a
jamaica
negro
i
should
have
no
hesitation
in
preferring
the
latter
for
myself
it
appears
to
me
almost
worth
surrendering
the
luxuries
and
pleasures
of
great
britain
for
the
single
pleasure
of
being
surrounded
with
beings
who
are
always
laughing
and
singing
and
who
seem
to
perform
their
work
with
so
much
taking
up
their
baskets
as
if
it
were
perfectly
optional
whether
they
took
them
up
or
left
them
there
sauntering
along
with
their
hands
dangling
stopping
to
chat
with
every
one
they
meet
or
if
they
meet
no
one
standing
still
to
look
round
and
examine
whether
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
that
can
amuse
them
so
that
i
can
hardly
persuade
myself
that
it
is
really
that
they
are
about
the
negro
might
well
say
on
his
arrival
in
england
massa
in
england
every
thing
work
for
here
nobody
appears
to
work
at
all
i
am
told
that
there
is
one
part
of
their
business
very
laborious
the
digging
holes
for
receiving
the
and
which
i
have
not
as
yet
seen
but
this
does
not
occupy
above
a
month
i
believe
at
the
utmost
at
two
periods
of
the
year
and
on
my
estate
this
service
is
chiefly
performed
by
extra
negroes
hired
for
the
purpose
which
although
equally
hard
on
the
hired
negroes
called
a
jobbing
gang
at
least
relieves
my
own
and
after
all
puts
even
the
former
on
much
the
same
footing
with
english
but
if
i
could
be
contented
to
in
jamaica
i
am
still
more
certain
that
it
is
the
only
agreeable
place
for
me
to
die
in
for
i
have
got
a
family
mausoleum
which
looks
for
all
the
world
like
the
theatrical
representation
of
the
tomb
of
all
the
its
outside
is
most
plentifully
decorated
with
sculptured
stones
arms
angels
epitaphs
and
within
is
a
tomb
of
the
purest
white
marble
raised
on
a
platform
of
ebony
the
building
which
is
surmounted
by
a
statue
of
time
with
his
scythe
and
stands
in
the
very
heart
of
an
orange
grove
now
in
full
bearing
and
the
whole
scene
this
morning
looked
so
cool
so
tranquil
and
so
gay
and
is
so
perfectly
divested
of
all
vestiges
of
dissolution
that
the
sight
of
it
quite
gave
me
an
appetite
for
being
buried
it
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
what
becomes
of
this
little
ugly
husk
of
mine
when
once
i
shall
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
or
else
i
should
certainly
follow
my
grandfather
s
example
and
die
where
i
might
order
my
body
to
be
sent
over
for
burial
to
cornwall
for
i
never
yet
saw
a
place
where
one
could
lie
down
more
comfortably
to
listen
for
the
last
trumpet
january
sunday
i
gave
a
dinner
to
my
white
people
as
the
are
called
here
and
who
have
a
separate
house
and
establishment
for
themselves
and
certainly
a
man
must
be
destitute
of
every
spark
of
hospitality
and
have
had
caucasus
horrens
for
his
if
he
can
resist
giving
dinners
in
a
country
where
nature
seems
to
have
set
up
a
superior
kind
of
london
tavern
of
her
own
they
who
are
possessed
by
the
ambitiosa
fames
et
lautæ
gloria
mensæ
ought
to
ship
themselves
off
for
jamaica
out
of
hand
and
even
the
lord
mayor
himself
need
not
blush
to
give
his
aldermen
such
a
dinner
as
is
placed
on
my
table
even
when
i
dine
alone
land
and
sea
turtle
quails
snipes
plovers
and
pigeons
and
doves
of
all
descriptions
of
which
the
has
been
allowed
to
rank
with
the
most
exquisite
of
the
winged
species
by
epicures
of
such
distinction
that
their
opinion
in
matters
of
this
nature
almost
carries
with
it
the
weight
of
a
law
excellent
pork
barbicued
pigs
pepperpots
with
numberless
other
excellent
dishes
form
the
ordinary
fare
while
the
poultry
is
so
large
and
fine
that
if
the
dragon
of
wantley
found
houses
and
churches
to
be
geese
and
turkies
in
england
he
would
mistake
the
geese
and
turkies
for
houses
and
churches
here
then
our
tarts
are
made
of
pineapples
and
make
the
best
tarts
that
i
ever
tasted
there
is
no
end
of
the
variety
of
fruits
of
which
the
shaddock
is
in
itself
an
host
but
the
most
singular
and
exquisite
flavour
perhaps
is
to
be
found
in
the
granadillo
a
fruit
which
grows
upon
a
species
of
vine
and
in
fact
appears
to
be
a
kind
of
cucumber
it
must
be
suffered
to
hang
till
it
is
dead
ripe
when
it
is
scarcely
any
thing
except
juice
and
seeds
which
can
only
be
eaten
with
a
spoon
it
requires
sugar
but
the
acid
is
truly
delicious
and
like
no
other
separate
flavour
that
i
ever
met
with
what
it
most
resembles
is
a
as
it
unites
the
different
tastes
of
almost
all
other
fruits
and
has
at
the
same
time
a
very
strong
flavour
of
wine
as
to
fish
savannah
la
mar
is
reckoned
the
best
place
in
the
island
both
for
variety
and
for
in
many
parts
the
fish
feed
upon
copperas
banks
and
can
not
be
used
without
much
precaution
here
none
is
necessary
and
it
is
only
to
be
wished
that
their
names
equalled
their
flesh
in
taste
for
it
must
be
owned
that
nothing
can
be
less
tempting
than
the
sounds
of
snappers
groupas
and
grunts
of
the
sea
fish
which
i
have
hitherto
met
with
the
silk
appears
to
me
the
best
and
of
rivers
the
but
indeed
the
fish
is
generally
so
excellent
and
in
such
profusion
that
i
never
sit
down
to
table
without
wishing
for
the
company
of
queen
atygatis
of
scythia
who
was
so
particularly
fond
of
fish
that
she
prohibited
all
her
subjects
from
eating
it
on
pain
of
death
through
fear
that
there
might
not
be
enough
left
for
her
majesty
this
fondness
for
fish
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
royal
passion
more
than
one
of
our
english
sovereigns
died
of
eating
too
many
lampreys
though
to
own
the
truth
it
was
suspected
that
the
monks
in
an
instance
or
two
improved
the
same
by
the
addition
of
a
little
ratsbane
and
mirabeau
assures
us
that
frederick
the
second
of
prussia
might
have
prolonged
his
existence
if
he
could
but
have
resisted
the
fascination
of
an
but
the
charm
was
too
strong
for
him
and
like
his
of
all
he
ate
and
died
all
for
or
this
world
well
lost
and
now
which
had
to
resist
the
most
difficult
temptation
frederic
or
eve
longed
to
experience
pleasures
yet
untasted
and
which
she
fancied
to
be
exquisite
like
sigismunda
pined
after
known
pleasures
and
which
he
knew
to
be
good
was
the
dupe
of
imagination
fell
a
victim
to
established
habit
which
was
the
most
deserving
pardon
there
is
a
question
for
the
bishops
those
clergymen
who
reside
constantly
on
their
livings
as
all
clergymen
ought
to
do
or
they
ought
not
to
be
clergymen
i
shall
in
charity
believe
to
have
something
better
to
do
with
their
time
than
to
solve
it
the
of
the
negroes
furnish
them
with
plantains
bananas
and
yams
of
the
latter
there
is
a
regular
harvest
once
a
year
and
they
remain
in
great
perfection
for
many
months
provided
they
are
dug
up
carefully
but
the
slightest
wound
with
the
spade
is
sufficient
to
rot
them
catalue
a
species
of
spinach
is
a
principal
article
in
their
but
in
this
parish
their
most
valuable
and
regular
supply
of
food
arises
from
the
or
coccos
a
species
of
the
yam
but
which
lasts
all
the
year
round
these
vegetables
form
the
basis
of
negro
sustenance
but
the
slaves
also
receive
from
their
owners
a
regular
weekly
allowance
of
red
herrings
and
salt
meat
which
serves
to
relish
their
vegetable
diet
and
indeed
they
are
so
passionately
fond
of
salted
provisions
that
instead
of
giving
them
fresh
beef
as
at
their
festival
of
saturday
last
i
have
been
advised
to
provide
some
hogsheads
of
salt
fish
as
likely
to
afford
them
more
gratification
at
such
future
additional
holidays
as
i
may
find
it
possible
to
allow
them
in
this
busy
season
of
crop
january
the
offspring
of
a
white
man
and
black
woman
is
a
the
mulatto
and
black
produce
a
from
the
mulatto
and
white
comes
the
from
the
quadroon
and
white
the
the
child
of
a
mustee
by
a
white
man
is
called
a
while
the
children
of
a
musteefino
are
free
by
law
and
rank
as
white
persons
to
all
intents
and
purposes
i
think
it
is
long
who
asserts
that
two
mulattoes
will
never
have
children
but
as
far
as
the
most
positive
assurances
can
go
since
my
arrival
in
jamaica
i
have
reason
to
believe
the
contrary
and
that
mulattoes
breed
together
just
as
well
as
blacks
and
whites
but
they
are
almost
universally
weak
and
effeminate
persons
and
thus
their
children
are
very
difficult
to
rear
on
a
sugar
estate
one
black
is
considered
as
more
than
equal
to
two
mulattoes
beautiful
as
are
their
forms
in
general
and
easy
and
graceful
as
are
their
movements
which
indeed
appear
to
me
so
striking
that
they
can
not
fail
to
excite
the
admiration
of
any
one
who
has
ever
looked
with
delight
on
statues
still
the
women
of
colour
are
deficient
in
one
of
the
most
requisite
points
of
female
beauty
when
oromases
was
employed
in
the
formation
of
woman
and
said
let
her
enchanting
bosom
resemble
the
celestial
spheres
he
must
certainly
have
suffered
the
negress
to
slip
out
of
his
mind
young
or
old
i
have
not
yet
seen
such
a
thing
as
a
january
i
never
witnessed
on
the
stage
a
scene
so
picturesque
as
a
negro
village
i
walked
through
my
own
and
visited
the
houses
of
the
drivers
and
other
principal
persons
and
if
i
were
to
decide
according
to
my
own
taste
i
should
infinitely
have
preferred
their
habitations
to
my
own
each
house
is
surrounded
by
a
separate
garden
and
the
whole
village
is
intersected
by
lanes
bordered
with
all
kinds
of
and
flowering
plants
but
not
such
gardens
as
those
belonging
to
our
english
cottages
where
a
few
cabbages
and
carrots
just
peep
up
and
grovel
upon
the
earth
between
hedges
in
square
narrow
beds
and
where
the
tallest
tree
is
a
gooseberry
bush
the
vegetables
of
the
negroes
are
all
cultivated
in
their
these
form
their
and
these
are
all
for
ornament
or
luxury
and
are
filled
with
a
profusion
of
oranges
shaddocks
and
peppers
of
all
descriptions
in
particular
i
was
shown
the
abba
or
resembling
the
but
much
more
beautiful
as
its
leaves
are
larger
and
more
numerous
and
feathering
to
the
ground
as
they
grow
old
they
form
a
kind
of
natural
arbour
it
bears
a
large
fruit
or
rather
vegetable
towards
the
top
of
the
tree
in
shape
like
the
cone
of
the
pine
but
formed
of
seeds
some
scarlet
and
bright
as
coral
others
of
a
or
purple
the
abba
requires
a
length
of
years
to
arrive
at
maturity
a
very
fine
one
which
was
shown
me
this
morning
was
supposed
to
be
upwards
of
an
hundred
years
old
and
one
of
a
very
moderate
size
had
been
planted
at
the
least
twenty
years
and
had
only
borne
fruit
once
it
appears
to
me
a
strong
proof
of
the
good
treatment
which
the
negroes
on
cornwall
have
been
accustomed
to
receive
that
there
are
many
very
old
people
upon
it
i
saw
a
woman
near
a
hundred
years
of
age
and
i
am
told
that
there
are
several
of
sixty
seventy
and
eighty
i
was
glad
also
to
find
that
several
negroes
who
have
obtained
their
freedom
and
possess
little
properties
of
their
own
in
the
mountains
and
at
savannah
la
mar
look
upon
my
estate
so
little
as
the
scene
of
their
former
sufferings
while
slaves
that
they
frequently
come
down
to
pass
a
few
days
in
their
ancient
habitations
with
their
former
companions
by
way
of
relaxation
one
woman
in
particular
expressed
her
hopes
that
i
should
not
be
offended
at
her
still
coming
to
cornwall
now
and
then
although
she
belonged
to
it
no
longer
and
begged
me
to
give
directions
before
my
return
to
england
that
her
visits
should
not
be
hindered
on
the
grounds
of
her
having
no
business
there
my
visit
to
jamaica
has
at
least
produced
one
advantage
to
myself
several
runaways
who
had
disappeared
for
some
time
some
even
for
several
months
have
again
made
their
appearance
in
the
field
and
i
have
desired
that
no
questions
should
be
asked
on
the
other
hand
after
enjoying
herself
during
the
saturday
and
sunday
which
were
allowed
for
holidays
on
my
arrival
one
of
my
ladies
chose
to
and
did
not
return
from
her
in
the
mountains
till
this
morning
her
name
is
marcia
but
so
unlike
is
she
to
addison
s
marcia
that
she
is
not
only
as
black
as
juba
instead
of
being
fair
oh
how
divinely
fair
but
whereas
sempronius
complains
that
marcia
the
lovely
marcia
is
left
behind
the
complaint
against
my
heroine
is
that
marcia
the
lovely
marcia
is
always
running
away
in
excuse
for
her
disappearance
she
alleged
that
so
far
was
her
husband
from
thinking
that
she
towered
above
her
sex
that
he
had
called
her
a
very
bad
woman
which
had
provoked
her
so
much
that
she
could
not
bear
to
stay
with
him
and
she
assured
me
that
he
was
himself
a
very
bad
man
which
if
true
was
certainly
enough
to
justify
any
lady
black
or
white
in
making
a
little
incognito
excursion
for
a
week
or
so
therefore
as
it
appeared
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
conjugal
quarrel
and
as
marcia
engaged
never
to
run
away
any
more
at
the
same
time
allowing
that
she
had
suffered
her
resentment
to
carry
her
too
far
when
it
had
carried
her
all
the
way
to
the
mountains
i
desired
that
an
act
of
oblivion
might
be
passed
in
favour
of
cato
s
daughter
and
away
she
went
quite
happy
to
pick
hog
s
meat
the
negro
houses
are
composed
of
wattles
on
the
outside
with
rafters
of
and
are
well
plastered
within
and
whitewashed
they
consist
of
two
chambers
one
for
cooking
and
the
other
for
sleeping
and
are
in
general
well
furnished
with
chairs
tables
and
i
saw
none
without
a
bedstead
and
plenty
of
for
in
spite
of
the
warmth
of
the
climate
when
the
sun
is
not
above
the
horizon
the
negro
always
feels
very
chilly
i
am
assured
that
many
of
my
slaves
are
very
rich
and
their
property
is
inviolable
and
that
they
are
i
ll
never
without
salt
provisions
porter
and
even
wine
to
entertain
their
friends
and
their
visiters
from
the
bay
or
the
mountains
as
i
passed
through
their
grounds
many
little
requests
were
preferred
to
me
one
wanted
an
additional
supply
of
lime
for
the
whitewashing
his
house
another
was
building
a
new
house
for
a
superannuated
wife
for
they
have
all
so
much
decency
as
to
call
their
sexual
attachments
by
a
conjugal
name
and
wanted
a
little
assistance
towards
the
finishing
it
a
third
requested
a
new
axe
to
work
with
and
several
entreated
me
to
negotiate
the
purchase
of
some
relation
or
friend
belonging
to
another
estate
and
with
whom
they
were
anxious
to
be
reunited
but
all
their
requests
were
for
additional
indulgences
not
one
complained
of
hunger
or
poor
nicholas
gave
me
a
fresh
instance
of
his
being
one
of
those
whom
fortune
pitches
upon
to
show
her
spite
he
has
had
four
children
none
of
whom
are
alive
and
the
eldest
of
them
a
fine
little
girl
of
four
years
old
fell
into
the
and
was
drowned
before
any
one
was
aware
of
her
danger
his
wife
told
me
that
she
had
had
fifteen
children
had
taken
the
utmost
care
of
them
and
yet
had
now
but
two
alive
she
said
indeed
fifteen
at
the
first
but
she
afterwards
corrected
herself
and
explained
that
she
had
had
twelve
whole
children
and
three
half
ones
by
which
she
meant
miscarriages
besides
the
profits
arising
from
their
superabundance
of
provisions
which
the
better
sort
of
negroes
are
enabled
to
sell
regularly
once
a
week
at
savannah
la
mar
to
a
considerable
amount
they
keep
a
large
stock
of
poultry
and
pigs
without
number
which
latter
cost
their
owners
but
little
though
they
cost
me
a
great
deal
for
they
generally
make
their
way
into
the
and
sometimes
eat
me
up
an
hogshead
of
sugar
in
the
course
of
the
morning
but
the
most
expensive
of
the
planter
s
enemies
are
the
rats
whose
numbers
are
incredible
and
are
so
destructive
that
a
reward
is
given
for
killing
them
during
the
last
six
months
my
agent
has
paid
for
three
thousand
rats
killed
upon
cornwall
nor
is
the
sugar
which
they
consume
the
worst
damage
which
they
commit
the
worst
mischief
is
that
if
through
the
carelessness
of
those
whose
business
it
is
to
supply
the
mill
one
cane
which
has
been
gnawed
by
the
rats
is
allowed
admittance
that
single
damaged
piece
is
sufficient
to
produce
acidity
enough
to
spoil
the
whole
sugar
january
in
this
country
there
is
scarcely
any
twilight
and
all
nature
seems
to
wake
at
the
same
moment
about
six
o
clock
the
darkness
disperses
the
sun
rises
and
instantly
every
thing
is
in
motion
the
negroes
are
going
to
the
field
the
cattle
are
driving
to
pasture
the
pigs
and
the
poultry
are
pouring
out
from
their
hutches
the
old
women
are
preparing
food
on
the
lawn
for
the
the
very
small
children
whom
they
keep
feeding
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
all
seem
to
be
going
to
their
employments
none
to
their
work
the
men
and
the
women
just
as
quietly
and
leisurely
as
the
pigs
and
the
poultry
the
sight
is
really
quite
gay
and
amusing
and
i
am
generally
out
of
bed
in
time
to
enjoy
it
especially
as
the
continuance
of
the
cool
north
breezes
renders
the
weather
still
delicious
though
the
pleasure
is
rather
an
expensive
one
not
a
drop
of
rain
has
fallen
since
the
of
november
the
young
canes
are
burning
and
the
drying
quality
of
these
norths
is
still
more
detrimental
than
the
want
of
rain
so
that
these
winds
may
be
said
to
blow
my
pockets
inside
out
and
as
every
draught
of
air
which
i
inhale
with
so
much
pleasure
is
estimated
to
cost
me
a
guinea
i
feel
while
breathing
it
like
miss
burney
s
citizen
at
vauxhall
who
kept
muttering
to
himself
with
every
bit
of
ham
that
he
put
into
his
mouth
there
goes
sixpence
and
there
goes
a
shilling
january
a
which
was
killed
in
the
neighbouring
morass
has
just
been
brought
to
me
this
is
the
alligator
in
miniature
and
is
even
more
dreaded
by
the
negroes
than
its
great
relation
it
is
only
to
be
found
in
swamps
and
morasses
that
which
was
brought
to
me
was
about
eighteen
inches
in
length
and
i
understand
that
it
is
seldom
longer
although
as
it
grows
in
years
its
thickness
and
the
size
of
its
jaws
and
head
become
greatly
increased
it
runs
away
on
being
encountered
and
conceals
itself
and
it
is
only
dangerous
if
trampled
upon
by
accident
or
if
attacked
but
then
its
bite
is
a
dreadful
one
not
only
from
its
tongue
being
armed
with
a
sting
the
venom
of
which
is
very
powerful
although
not
mortal
but
from
its
teeth
being
so
brittle
that
they
generally
break
in
the
wound
and
as
it
is
hardly
possible
to
extract
the
pieces
entirely
the
wound
corrupts
and
becomes
an
incurable
sore
of
the
most
offensive
nature
luckily
these
reptiles
are
very
scarce
but
nothing
can
exceed
the
terror
and
aversion
in
which
they
are
held
by
the
negroes
this
dead
one
had
been
lying
in
the
room
for
several
hours
yet
on
my
servant
s
accidentally
stirring
the
board
on
which
the
was
stretched
for
my
inspection
my
little
negro
servant
george
darted
out
of
the
room
in
terror
and
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
in
a
moment
the
skin
of
this
animal
appeared
to
be
like
shagreen
in
looks
and
strength
and
was
almost
entirely
composed
of
layers
of
very
small
scales
the
colours
were
and
the
teeth
numerous
and
piercing
and
the
claws
of
the
feet
very
long
and
sharp
altogether
it
is
a
hideous
and
disgusting
creature
as
to
the
alligator
of
jamaica
it
is
a
timid
animal
which
never
was
known
to
attack
the
human
species
though
it
frequently
takes
the
liberty
of
running
away
with
a
dog
or
two
which
appears
to
be
their
venison
and
turtle
there
is
no
river
on
my
estate
large
enough
for
their
inhabiting
but
in
paradise
river
which
is
not
above
four
miles
off
i
understand
that
they
are
common
january
a
young
mulatto
carpenter
belonging
to
horace
beckford
s
estate
of
shrewsbury
came
to
beg
my
intercession
with
his
overseer
he
had
been
absent
two
days
without
leave
and
on
these
occasions
it
is
customary
for
the
slaves
to
apply
to
some
neighbouring
gentleman
for
a
note
in
their
behalf
which
as
i
am
told
never
fails
to
obtain
the
pardon
required
as
the
managers
of
estates
are
in
general
but
too
happy
to
find
an
excuse
for
passing
over
without
punishment
any
offences
which
are
not
very
heinous
indeed
what
with
the
excellent
laws
already
enacted
for
the
protection
of
the
slaves
and
which
every
year
are
still
further
ameliorated
and
what
with
the
difficulty
of
procuring
more
negroes
which
can
now
only
be
done
by
purchasing
them
from
other
estates
which
makes
it
absolutely
necessary
for
the
managers
to
preserve
the
slaves
if
they
mean
to
preserve
their
own
situations
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
instances
of
tyranny
to
negroes
are
now
very
rare
at
least
in
this
island
but
i
must
still
acknowledge
from
my
own
sad
experience
since
my
arrival
that
unless
a
proprietor
occasionally
visit
his
estates
himself
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
him
to
be
that
his
deputed
authority
is
not
abused
however
good
may
be
his
intentions
and
however
vigilant
his
anxiety
my
father
was
one
of
the
most
humane
and
generous
persons
that
ever
existed
there
was
no
indulgence
which
he
ever
denied
his
negroes
and
his
letters
were
filled
with
the
most
absolute
injunctions
for
their
good
treatment
when
his
estates
became
mine
the
one
upon
which
i
am
now
residing
was
managed
by
an
attorney
considerably
advanced
in
years
who
had
been
long
in
our
employment
and
who
bore
the
highest
character
for
probity
and
humanity
he
was
both
attorney
and
overseer
and
it
was
a
particular
recommendation
to
me
that
he
lived
in
my
own
house
and
therefore
had
my
slaves
so
immediately
under
his
eye
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
subaltern
to
misuse
them
without
his
knowledge
his
letters
to
me
expressed
the
greatest
anxiety
and
attention
respecting
the
welfare
and
comfort
of
the
slaves
so
much
so
indeed
that
when
i
detailed
his
mode
of
management
to
lord
holland
he
observed
that
if
he
did
all
that
was
mentioned
in
his
letters
he
did
as
much
as
could
possibly
be
expected
or
wished
from
an
attorney
and
on
parting
with
his
own
lord
holland
was
induced
to
take
mine
to
manage
his
estates
which
are
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
cornwall
this
man
died
about
two
years
ago
and
since
my
arrival
i
happened
to
hear
that
during
his
management
a
remarkably
fine
young
named
richard
the
brother
of
my
intelligent
carpenter
john
fuller
had
run
away
several
times
to
the
mountains
i
had
taken
occasion
to
let
the
brothers
know
between
jest
and
earnest
that
i
was
aware
of
richard
s
misconduct
and
at
length
one
morning
john
while
he
blamed
his
brother
s
running
away
let
fall
that
he
had
some
excuse
in
the
extreme
which
he
had
received
from
one
of
the
bookkeepers
who
had
had
a
spite
against
the
hint
alarmed
me
i
followed
it
and
nothing
could
equal
my
anger
and
surprise
at
learning
the
whole
truth
it
seems
that
while
i
fancied
my
attorney
to
be
resident
on
cornwall
he
was
in
fact
generally
attending
to
a
property
of
his
own
or
looking
after
estates
of
which
also
he
had
the
management
in
distant
parts
of
the
island
during
his
absence
an
overseer
of
his
own
appointing
without
my
knowledge
was
left
in
absolute
possession
of
his
power
which
he
abused
to
such
a
degree
that
almost
every
slave
of
respectability
on
the
estate
was
compelled
to
become
a
runaway
the
property
was
nearly
ruined
and
absolutely
in
a
state
of
rebellion
and
at
length
he
committed
an
act
of
such
severity
that
the
negroes
one
and
all
fled
to
savannah
la
mar
and
threw
themselves
upon
the
protection
of
the
magistrates
who
immediately
came
over
to
cornwall
investigated
the
complaint
and
at
length
the
attorney
who
had
known
frequent
instances
of
the
overseer
s
tyranny
had
frequently
rebuked
him
for
them
and
had
redressed
the
sufferers
but
who
still
had
dared
to
abuse
my
confidence
so
grossly
as
to
continue
him
in
his
situation
upon
this
public
exposure
thought
proper
to
dismiss
him
yet
while
all
this
was
going
on
while
my
negroes
were
groaning
under
the
iron
rod
of
this
petty
tyrant
and
while
the
public
magistrature
was
obliged
to
interfere
to
protect
them
from
his
cruelty
my
attorney
had
the
insolence
and
falsehood
to
write
me
letters
filled
with
assurances
of
his
perpetual
vigilance
for
their
welfare
of
their
perfect
good
treatment
and
satisfaction
nor
if
i
had
not
come
myself
to
jamaica
in
all
probability
should
i
ever
have
had
the
most
distant
idea
how
abominably
the
poor
creatures
had
been
misused
i
have
made
it
my
business
to
mix
as
much
as
possible
among
the
negroes
and
have
given
them
every
encouragement
to
repose
confidence
in
me
and
i
have
uniformly
found
all
those
upon
whom
any
reliance
can
be
placed
unite
in
praising
the
humanity
of
their
present
superintendant
instantly
on
his
arrival
he
took
the
whole
power
of
punishment
into
his
own
hands
he
forbade
the
slightest
interference
in
this
respect
of
any
person
whatever
on
the
estate
white
or
black
nor
have
i
been
able
to
find
as
yet
any
one
negro
who
has
any
charge
of
harsh
treatment
to
bring
against
him
however
having
been
already
so
grossly
deceived
i
will
never
again
place
implicit
confidence
in
any
person
whatever
in
a
matter
of
such
importance
before
my
departure
i
shall
take
every
possible
measure
that
may
prevent
any
misconduct
taking
place
without
my
being
apprised
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
have
already
exhorted
my
negroes
to
apply
to
the
magistrates
on
the
very
first
instance
of
should
any
occur
during
my
absence
i
am
indeed
assured
by
every
one
about
me
that
to
manage
a
estate
without
the
occasional
use
of
the
however
rarely
is
impossible
and
they
insist
upon
it
that
it
is
absurd
in
me
to
call
my
slaves
because
when
they
act
grossly
wrong
they
are
treated
like
english
soldiers
and
sailors
all
this
may
be
very
true
but
there
is
something
to
me
so
shocking
in
the
idea
of
this
execrable
that
i
have
positively
forbidden
the
use
of
it
on
cornwall
and
if
the
estate
must
go
to
rack
and
ruin
without
its
use
to
rack
and
ruin
the
estate
must
go
probably
i
should
care
less
about
this
punishment
if
i
had
not
been
living
among
those
on
whom
it
may
be
inflicted
but
now
when
i
am
accustomed
to
see
every
face
that
looks
upon
me
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
with
pleasure
at
my
notice
and
hear
every
voice
cry
god
bless
you
massa
as
i
pass
one
must
be
an
absolute
brute
not
to
feel
unwilling
to
leave
them
subject
to
the
lash
besides
they
are
excellent
cajolers
and
lay
it
on
with
a
trowel
nicholas
and
john
fuller
came
to
me
this
morning
to
beg
a
favour
and
beg
massa
hard
quite
hard
it
was
that
when
massa
went
away
he
would
leave
his
picture
for
the
negroes
that
they
might
talk
to
it
all
just
as
they
did
to
shakspeare
says
a
little
flattery
does
well
sometimes
but
although
the
mode
of
expressing
it
may
be
artifice
the
sentiment
of
may
be
shown
a
dog
grows
attached
to
the
person
who
feeds
and
makes
much
of
him
and
as
they
have
never
experienced
as
yet
any
but
kind
treatment
from
me
personally
it
would
be
against
common
sense
and
nature
to
suppose
that
my
negroes
do
not
feel
kindly
towards
me

january
sunday
the
hospital
has
been
crowded
since
my
arrival
with
patients
who
have
nothing
the
matter
with
them
on
wednesday
there
were
about
thirty
invalids
of
whom
only
four
were
cases
at
all
serious
the
rest
had
a
lilly
pain
here
massa
or
a
bad
pain
me
know
nowhere
massa
and
evidently
only
came
to
the
hospital
in
order
to
sit
idle
and
chat
away
the
time
with
their
friends
four
of
them
the
doctor
ordered
into
the
field
peremptorily
the
next
day
there
came
into
the
six
others
upon
this
i
resolved
to
try
my
own
hand
at
curing
them
and
i
directed
the
to
announce
that
the
presents
which
i
had
brought
from
england
should
be
distributed
that
the
children
should
be
christened
and
that
the
negroes
might
take
possession
of
my
house
and
amuse
themselves
till
twelve
at
night
the
effect
of
my
prescription
was
magical
two
thirds
of
the
sick
were
hale
and
hearty
at
work
in
the
field
on
saturday
morning
and
not
a
soul
remained
in
the
hospital
except
the
four
serious
cases
the
christening
took
place
about
four
o
clock
sully
s
infant
which
had
been
destined
to
perform
a
part
on
this
occasion
had
died
in
the
hospital
but
this
morning
the
father
came
to
complain
of
his
disappointment
and
to
beg
leave
to
substitute
a
child
wife
which
had
been
born
about
two
months
before
my
arrival
and
as
the
father
is
a
very
serviceable
fellow
and
the
mother
besides
having
brought
up
three
children
of
her
own
had
the
additional
merit
of
having
reared
an
infant
whose
own
mother
had
died
in
i
broke
through
the
rule
of
only
christening
those
myself
who
should
be
born
since
my
coming
to
jamaica
and
granted
his
request
by
good
luck
the
first
child
to
be
named
was
the
offspring
of
minerva
and
captain
so
i
told
the
parents
that
as
it
would
be
highly
proper
to
call
the
boy
after
the
greatest
captain
that
the
world
could
produce
he
should
be
named
wellington
and
that
i
hoped
that
he
would
grow
up
to
serve
in
jamaica
as
well
as
the
duke
of
wellington
had
served
his
massa
the
king
of
england
in
europe
the
duke
of
sully
s
child
i
wanted
to
call
navarre
but
the
father
had
brought
over
a
free
negro
from
savannah
la
mar
to
stand
godfather
who
was
his
by
the
name
of
john
davies
and
i
found
that
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
calling
the
boy
john
lewis
after
his
friend
and
myself
so
john
lewis
he
was
there
ought
to
have
been
a
third
child
born
at
seven
months
whom
the
had
reared
with
great
difficulty
and
dismissed
quite
strong
from
the
hospital
the
mother
had
taken
great
care
of
it
till
the
tenth
day
when
she
was
entitled
to
an
allowance
of
clothes
provisions
but
no
sooner
had
she
received
her
reward
than
on
that
very
night
she
suffered
the
child
to
remain
so
long
without
food
while
she
went
herself
to
dance
on
a
neighbouring
estate
that
it
was
brought
in
an
exhausted
state
back
to
the
hospital
and
in
spite
of
every
care
it
expired
within
four
and
twenty
hours
after
its
return
the
ceremony
was
performed
with
perfect
gravity
and
propriety
by
all
parties
i
thought
it
as
well
to
cut
the
reading
part
of
it
very
short
but
i
read
a
couple
of
prayers
marked
the
foreheads
of
the
children
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
instead
of
the
concluding
prayer
i
substituted
a
wish
that
god
would
bless
the
children
and
make
them
live
to
be
as
good
servants
to
me
as
i
prayed
him
to
make
me
a
kind
massa
to
them
upon
which
all
present
very
gravely
made
me
their
lowest
bows
and
courtesies
and
then
gave
me
a
loud
huzza
so
unusual
a
mode
of
approbation
at
a
christening
that
it
had
nearly
overturned
my
seriousness
and
i
made
haste
to
serve
out
madeira
to
the
parents
and
assistants
that
they
might
drink
the
healths
of
the
new
christians
and
of
each
other
the
mothers
and
the
were
then
called
up
to
the
table
and
the
ladies
in
a
family
way
were
arranged
behind
them
title
in
jamaica
is
rather
coarse
but
very
expressive
i
asked
cubina
one
day
who
was
that
woman
with
a
basket
on
her
head
massa
he
answered
that
one
going
to
sell
provisions
at
the
as
she
was
going
to
sell
i
supposed
that
was
the
name
of
her
trade
but
it
afterwards
appeared
that
she
was
one
of
those
females
who
had
given
in
their
names
as
being
then
labouring
under
the
pleasing
punishment
which
women
bear
and
who
in
consequence
were
discharged
from
all
severe
labour
i
then
gave
the
and
the
mothers
a
dollar
each
and
told
them
that
for
the
future
they
might
claim
the
same
sum
in
addition
to
their
usual
allowance
of
clothes
and
provisions
for
every
infant
which
should
be
brought
to
the
overseer
alive
and
well
on
the
fourteenth
day
and
i
also
gave
each
mother
a
present
of
a
scarlet
girdle
with
a
silver
medal
in
the
centre
telling
her
always
to
wear
it
on
feasts
and
holidays
when
it
should
entitle
her
to
marks
of
peculiar
respect
and
attention
such
as
being
one
of
the
first
served
and
receiving
a
larger
portion
than
the
rest
that
the
fault
which
she
might
commit
should
be
forgiven
on
the
production
of
this
girdle
and
that
when
she
should
have
any
favour
to
ask
she
should
always
put
it
round
her
waist
and
be
assured
that
on
seeing
it
the
overseer
would
allow
the
wearer
to
be
entitled
to
particular
indulgence
on
every
additional
child
an
additional
medal
is
to
be
affixed
to
the
belt
and
precedence
is
to
follow
the
greater
number
of
medals
i
expected
that
this
notion
of
an
order
of
honour
would
have
been
treated
as
completely
fanciful
and
romantic
but
to
my
great
surprise
my
manager
told
me
that
he
never
knew
a
dollar
better
bestowed
than
the
one
which
formed
the
medal
of
the
girdle
and
that
he
thought
the
institution
likely
to
have
a
very
good
immediately
after
the
christening
the
eboe
drums
were
produced
and
in
defiance
of
sunday
the
negroes
had
the
irreverence
to
be
gay
and
happy
while
the
presents
were
getting
in
order
for
distribution
all
the
men
got
jackets
the
women
seven
yards
of
stuff
each
for
petticoats
and
the
children
as
much
printed
cotton
as
would
make
a
couple
of
frocks
the
creoles
were
delighted
beyond
measure
when
some
of
the
african
male
negroes
exclaimed
tank
massa
and
made
a
low
courtesy
in
the
confusion
of
their
gratitude
as
they
were
all
called
to
receive
their
presents
alphabetically
in
pairs
some
of
the
combinations
were
very
amusing
we
had
punch
and
plato
priam
and
pam
hemp
and
hercules
and
minerva
and
moll
come
together
by
twelve
they
dispersed
and
i
went
to
bed
as
usual
on
these
occasions
with
a
violent
headach
january
while
i
was
at
dinner
a
violent
uproar
was
heard
below
stairs
on
enquiry
it
proved
to
be
cubina
quarrelling
with
his
niece
phillis
a
goodlooking
black
girl
employed
about
the
house
about
a
broken
pitcher
and
as
her
explanation
did
not
appear
satisfactory
to
him
he
had
thought
proper
to
give
her
a
few
boxes
on
the
ear
upon
hearing
this
i
read
him
such
a
lecture
upon
the
baseness
of
a
man
s
striking
a
woman
and
told
him
with
so
much
severity
that
his
heart
must
be
a
bad
one
to
commit
such
an
offence
that
poor
cubina
having
never
heard
a
harsh
word
from
me
before
scarcely
knew
whether
he
stood
upon
his
head
or
his
heels
when
he
afterwards
brought
my
coffee
he
expressed
his
sorrow
for
having
offended
me
and
begged
my
pardon
in
the
most
humble
manner
i
told
him
that
to
obtain
mine
he
must
first
obtain
that
of
phillis
and
he
immediately
declared
himself
ready
to
make
her
any
apology
that
i
might
dictate
so
the
girl
was
called
in
and
her
uncle
going
up
to
her
i
am
very
sorry
phillis
said
he
that
i
gave
way
to
high
passion
and
called
you
hard
names
and
struck
you
which
i
ought
not
to
have
done
while
massa
was
in
the
house
here
i
was
going
to
interrupt
him
but
he
was
too
clever
not
to
perceive
his
blunder
and
made
haste
to
add
nor
if
he
had
been
here
nor
at
all
so
i
hope
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
forgive
me
this
once
and
i
never
will
strike
you
again
and
so
i
beg
your
and
he
then
put
out
his
hand
to
her
in
the
most
frank
and
hearty
manner
imaginable
and
on
her
accepting
it
made
her
three
or
four
of
his
very
lowest
and
most
graceful
bows
i
furnished
him
with
a
piece
of
money
to
give
her
as
a
they
left
the
room
thoroughly
reconciled
and
in
five
minutes
after
they
and
the
rest
of
the
servants
were
all
chattering
laughing
and
singing
together
in
the
most
perfect
harmony
and
i
suppose
if
i
had
desired
an
upper
servant
in
england
to
make
the
same
submission
he
would
have
preferred
quitting
my
service
to
doing
what
he
would
have
called
humbling
himself
to
an
inferior
or
if
he
had
found
himself
compelled
to
give
way
he
would
have
been
sulky
with
the
girl
and
found
fault
with
every
thing
that
she
did
in
the
house
for
a
twelvemonth
after
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
choice
ungrateful
scoundrels
among
the
negroes
on
the
night
of
their
first
dance
a
couple
of
sheep
disappeared
from
the
pen
although
they
could
not
have
been
taken
from
want
of
food
as
on
that
very
morning
there
had
been
an
ample
distribution
of
fresh
beef
and
last
night
another
sheep
and
a
quantity
of
poultry
followed
them
yesterday
too
a
young
rascal
of
a
boy
called
massa
jackey
who
is
in
the
frequent
habit
of
running
away
for
months
at
a
time
and
whom
i
had
distinguished
from
the
cleverness
of
his
countenance
and
buffoonery
of
his
manners
came
to
beg
my
permission
to
go
and
purchase
food
with
some
money
which
i
had
just
given
him
because
he
was
almost
starving
his
parents
were
dead
he
had
no
no
allowance
and
nobody
ever
gave
him
upon
this
i
sent
cubina
with
the
boy
to
the
storekeeper
when
it
appeared
that
he
had
always
received
a
regular
allowance
of
provisions
twice
a
week
which
he
generally
sold
as
well
as
his
clothes
at
the
bay
for
spirits
had
received
an
additional
portion
only
last
friday
and
into
the
bargain
during
the
whole
of
that
week
had
been
fed
from
the
house
what
he
could
propose
to
himself
by
telling
a
lie
which
must
be
so
soon
detected
i
can
not
conceive
but
i
am
assured
that
unless
a
negro
has
an
interest
in
telling
the
truth
he
always
lies
in
order
to
keep
his
tongue
in
practice
one
species
of
flattery
or
of
as
we
call
it
here
amused
me
much
this
morning
an
old
woman
who
is
in
the
hospital
wanted
to
express
her
gratitude
for
some
stewed
fish
which
i
had
sent
her
for
supper
and
instead
of
calling
me
massa
she
always
said
tank
him
january
this
was
a
day
of
perpetual
occupation
i
rose
at
six
o
clock
and
went
down
to
the
bay
to
settle
some
business
on
my
return
i
visited
the
hospital
while
breakfast
was
getting
ready
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
i
went
down
to
the
to
hear
the
whole
body
of
eboes
lodge
a
complaint
against
one
of
the
and
appoint
a
day
for
their
being
heard
in
his
presence
on
my
return
to
the
house
i
found
two
women
belonging
to
a
neighbouring
estate
who
came
to
complain
of
cruel
treatment
from
their
overseer
and
to
request
me
to
inform
their
trustee
how
ill
they
had
been
used
and
see
their
injuries
redressed
they
said
that
having
been
ill
in
the
hospital
and
ordered
to
the
field
while
they
were
still
too
weak
to
work
they
had
been
flogged
with
much
severity
though
not
beyond
the
limits
of
the
law
and
my
head
driver
who
was
less
scrupulously
delicate
than
myself
as
to
ocular
inspection
of
juliet
s
person
which
juliet
to
do
her
justice
was
perfectly
ready
to
submit
to
in
proof
of
her
assertions
told
me
that
the
woman
had
certainly
suffered
greatly
the
other
whose
name
was
delia
was
but
just
recovering
from
a
miscarriage
and
declared
openly
that
the
overseer
s
conduct
had
been
such
that
nothing
should
have
prevented
her
running
away
long
ago
if
she
could
but
have
had
the
heart
to
abandon
a
child
which
she
had
on
the
estate
both
were
poor
creatures
and
seemed
very
unfit
subjects
for
any
severe
correction
i
promised
to
write
to
their
trustee
and
as
they
were
afraid
of
being
punished
on
their
return
home
for
having
thrown
themselves
on
my
protection
i
wrote
a
note
to
the
overseer
requesting
that
the
women
might
remain
quite
unmolested
till
the
trustee
s
arrival
which
was
daily
expected
and
with
this
note
and
a
present
of
and
salt
fish
delia
and
juliet
departed
apparently
much
comforted
they
were
succeeded
by
no
less
a
personage
than
herself
a
poor
little
sickly
timid
soul
who
had
purchased
her
freedom
from
my
father
by
substituting
in
her
place
a
fine
stout
black
wench
who
being
venus
s
was
by
courtesy
called
venus
too
though
her
right
name
was
big
joan
but
by
some
neglect
of
the
then
attorney
venus
had
never
received
any
title
and
she
now
came
to
beg
massa
so
good
as
give
paper
otherwise
she
was
still
to
all
intents
and
purposes
my
slave
and
i
might
still
have
compelled
her
to
work
although
at
the
same
time
her
substitute
was
on
the
estate
of
course
i
promised
the
paper
required
and
engaged
to
act
the
part
of
a
second
vulcan
by
releasing
venus
from
my
chains
but
the
paper
was
not
the
only
thing
that
venus
wanted
she
also
wanted
a
petticoat
she
told
me
that
when
the
presents
were
distributed
on
sunday
the
petticoat
which
she
would
otherwise
have
had
was
of
course
given
to
the
venus
and
though
to
be
sure
she
was
free
now
yet
when
she
belonged
to
massa
she
had
always
worked
for
him
well
and
she
was
quite
as
glad
to
see
massa
as
the
other
venus
and
therefore
ought
to
have
quite
as
much
i
tried
to
convince
her
that
for
venus
to
wear
a
petticoat
of
blue
durant
or
indeed
any
petticoat
at
all
would
be
quite
unclassical
the
goddess
of
beauty
stuck
to
her
point
and
finally
carried
off
the
petticoat
venus
had
scarcely
evacuated
the
premises
when
her
place
was
occupied
by
the
minister
of
savannah
la
mar
with
proposals
for
instructing
the
negroes
in
religion
and
the
minister
in
his
turn
was
replaced
by
one
of
the
thieves
who
had
been
caught
while
in
the
actual
possession
of
one
of
my
sheep
and
a
great
and
to
make
the
matter
worse
the
depredator
s
name
was
hercules
hercules
whom
virgil
states
to
have
exercised
so
much
severity
on
cacus
when
his
own
oxen
were
stolen
was
taken
up
himself
for
stealing
my
sheep
in
jamaica
the
had
nothing
to
say
in
his
excuse
he
had
just
received
a
large
allowance
of
beef
therefore
hunger
had
no
share
in
his
transgression
and
the
committing
the
offence
during
the
very
time
that
i
was
giving
the
negroes
a
festival
rendered
his
ingratitude
the
more
flagrant
i
perfectly
well
understood
that
the
man
was
sent
to
me
by
my
agent
in
order
to
show
the
absolute
necessity
of
sometimes
employing
the
and
to
see
whether
i
would
suffer
the
fellow
to
escape
unpunished
but
as
this
was
the
first
offender
who
had
been
brought
before
me
i
took
that
for
a
pretext
to
absolve
him
so
i
lectured
him
for
half
an
hour
with
great
severity
swore
that
on
the
very
next
offence
i
would
order
him
to
be
sold
and
that
if
he
would
not
do
his
fair
proportion
of
work
without
being
lashed
he
should
be
sent
to
work
somewhere
else
for
i
would
suffer
no
such
worthless
fellows
on
my
estate
and
would
not
be
at
the
expense
of
a
to
correct
him
he
promised
most
earnestly
to
behave
better
in
future
and
hercules
was
suffered
to
depart
but
i
am
told
that
no
good
can
be
expected
of
him
that
he
is
perpetually
running
away
and
that
he
had
been
absent
for
five
weeks
together
before
my
arrival
and
only
returned
home
upon
hearing
that
there
was
a
distribution
of
beef
rum
and
jackets
going
forward
in
return
for
all
which
he
stole
my
sheep
and
my
poor
great
but
now
came
the
most
puzzling
business
of
the
day
about
four
years
ago
two
eboes
called
pickle
and
edward
were
rivals
after
being
intimate
friends
pickle
who
is
an
excellent
faithful
negro
but
not
very
wise
was
the
successful
candidate
and
of
course
the
friendship
was
interrupted
till
edward
married
the
sister
of
the
disputed
fair
one
from
this
time
the
lived
in
perfect
harmony
together
but
during
the
first
festival
given
on
my
arrival
pickle
s
house
was
broken
open
and
robbed
of
all
his
clothes
the
thief
was
sought
for
but
in
vain
on
monday
last
i
found
pickle
in
the
hospital
complaining
of
a
pain
in
his
side
and
the
blood
which
had
been
taken
from
him
gave
reason
to
apprehend
a
pleurisy
arising
from
cold
but
as
the
disorder
had
been
taken
in
its
earliest
stage
nothing
dangerous
was
expected
the
fever
abated
the
medicines
performed
their
offices
properly
still
the
man
s
spirits
and
strength
appeared
to
decline
and
he
persisted
in
saying
that
he
was
not
better
and
should
never
do
well
at
length
he
got
out
of
his
sick
bed
came
to
the
house
attended
by
the
whole
body
of
drivers
and
accused
his
of
having
been
the
stealer
of
his
goods
i
asked
had
edward
been
seen
near
his
house
had
any
of
his
effects
been
seen
in
edward
s
possession
did
edward
refuse
to
suffer
his
hut
to
be
searched
no
edward
who
was
present
pressed
for
the
most
strict
scrutiny
and
asserted
his
perfect
ignorance
nor
could
the
accuser
advance
any
grounds
for
the
charge
except
his
belief
of
edward
s
guilt
why
did
he
think
so
after
much
beating
about
the
bush
at
length
out
came
the
real
edward
had
him
he
had
accused
edward
of
breaking
open
his
house
and
had
begged
him
to
help
him
to
his
goods
again
and
edward
had
gone
at
midnight
into
the
bush
the
wood
and
had
gathered
the
plant
whangra
which
he
had
boiled
in
an
iron
pot
by
a
fire
of
leaves
over
which
he
went
pufij
puffie
and
said
the
and
then
had
cut
the
whangra
root
into
four
pieces
three
to
bury
at
the
plantation
gates
and
one
to
burn
and
to
each
of
these
three
pieces
he
gave
the
name
of
a
christian
one
of
which
was
daniel
and
edward
had
said
that
this
would
help
him
to
find
his
goods
but
instead
of
that
he
had
immediately
felt
this
pain
in
his
side
and
therefore
he
was
sure
that
instead
of
using
obeah
to
find
his
goods
edward
had
used
it
to
kill
himself
and
were
these
all
his
reasons
i
enquired
no
when
he
married
edward
was
very
angry
at
the
loss
of
his
mistress
and
had
said
that
they
never
would
live
well
and
happily
together
and
they
never
lived
happily
and
well
this
last
argument
quite
got
the
better
of
my
gravity
by
parity
of
reasoning
i
thought
that
almost
every
married
couple
in
great
britain
must
be
under
the
influence
of
obeah
i
endeavoured
to
convince
the
fellow
of
his
folly
and
injustice
especially
as
the
person
accused
was
the
identical
man
who
had
detected
the
obeah
priest
harboured
in
one
of
my
negro
huts
last
year
had
seized
him
with
his
own
hands
and
delivered
him
up
to
my
agent
who
had
prosecuted
and
transported
him
it
was
therefore
improbable
in
the
highest
degree
that
he
should
be
an
obeah
man
himself
and
all
the
bystanders
black
and
white
joined
me
in
ridiculing
pickle
for
complaints
so
improbable
and
childish
but
anger
argument
and
irony
were
all
ineffectual
i
offered
to
christen
him
and
expel
black
obeah
by
white
but
in
vain
the
fellow
persisted
in
saying
that
he
had
a
pain
in
his
side
and
edward
must
have
given
it
to
him
and
he
went
back
to
his
hospital
shaking
his
head
all
the
way
sullen
and
unconvinced
he
is
a
young
strong
negro
perfectly
well
disposed
and
doing
his
due
portion
of
work
willingly
and
it
will
be
truly
provoking
to
lose
him
by
the
influence
of
this
foolish
prejudice
january
i
sent
for
edward
had
him
alone
with
me
for
above
two
hours
and
pressed
him
most
earnestly
to
confide
in
me
i
gave
him
a
dollar
to
convince
him
of
my
towards
him
assured
him
that
whatever
he
might
tell
me
should
remain
a
secret
between
us
said
that
i
was
certain
of
his
not
having
used
any
poison
or
done
any
thing
really
mischievous
but
as
i
suspected
him
of
having
played
some
or
other
which
however
harmless
in
themselves
had
evidently
operated
dangerously
upon
pickle
s
imagination
i
begged
him
to
tell
me
precisely
what
had
passed
in
order
that
i
might
counteract
its
baleful
effects
in
reply
edward
swore
to
me
most
solemnly
by
the
great
god
almighty
who
lives
above
the
clouds
that
he
never
had
used
any
such
practices
that
he
had
never
gone
into
the
wood
to
gather
whangra
and
that
he
had
considered
pickle
from
the
moment
of
his
own
marriage
as
his
brother
and
had
always
till
then
loved
him
as
such
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
while
he
protested
that
he
should
be
as
sorry
for
pickle
s
death
as
if
it
were
himself
and
he
complained
bitterly
of
having
the
ill
name
of
an
obeah
man
given
to
him
which
made
him
feared
and
shunned
by
his
companions
and
entirely
without
cause
but
he
said
that
he
was
certain
that
pickle
would
never
have
suspected
him
of
such
a
crime
if
a
third
person
had
not
put
it
into
his
head
there
is
a
negro
on
my
estate
called
adam
who
has
been
long
and
strongly
suspected
of
having
connections
with
obeah
men
when
edward
was
quite
young
he
was
under
this
fellow
s
superintendence
and
he
now
assured
me
that
adam
had
not
only
endeavoured
to
draw
him
into
similar
practices
but
had
even
pressed
him
very
earnestly
to
lay
a
magical
egg
under
the
door
of
a
whose
conduct
had
been
obnoxious
edward
had
positively
refused
from
that
moment
his
superintendent
from
being
his
protector
had
become
his
enemy
had
shown
him
spite
upon
every
occasion
and
he
it
was
he
had
no
doubt
who
for
the
purpose
of
injuring
him
had
put
this
foolish
notion
into
pickle
s
head
upon
enquiry
it
appeared
that
on
the
very
morning
succeeding
pickle
s
entering
the
hospital
this
suspected
man
had
gone
there
also
on
pretence
of
sickness
and
had
remained
there
to
watch
the
invalid
although
it
was
so
evident
that
nothing
was
the
matter
with
him
that
the
doctor
had
frequently
ordered
him
to
the
field
but
the
man
had
always
found
means
for
evading
the
order
the
first
thing
that
we
now
did
was
to
turn
him
out
of
the
neck
and
heels
i
then
took
edward
with
me
to
pickle
s
bedside
where
the
former
told
his
that
if
he
had
ever
done
any
thing
to
offend
him
he
heartily
begged
his
pardon
that
he
swore
by
the
almighty
god
that
he
had
never
been
in
the
bush
to
hurt
him
nor
any
where
else
on
the
contrary
that
he
had
always
loved
him
and
wished
him
well
and
that
he
now
begged
him
to
be
friends
with
him
again
to
forget
and
forgive
all
former
quarrels
and
to
accept
the
hand
which
he
offered
him
in
all
sincerity
the
sick
man
also
confessed
that
he
had
always
loved
edward
as
his
brother
had
eaten
and
drunk
with
him
for
many
years
with
perfect
and
that
it
was
his
ingratitude
for
such
affection
which
vexed
him
more
than
any
thing
on
this
i
told
him
that
i
insisted
upon
their
being
good
friends
for
the
future
and
that
i
should
never
hear
the
word
obeah
or
any
such
nonsense
mentioned
on
my
estate
on
pain
of
my
extreme
displeasure
i
promised
that
as
soon
as
pickle
should
be
quite
recovered
i
would
buy
for
him
exactly
a
set
of
such
things
as
had
been
stolen
from
him
that
edward
should
bring
them
to
his
house
to
show
that
he
had
rather
give
him
things
than
take
them
away
and
i
then
desired
to
see
them
shake
hands
they
did
so
with
much
apparent
cordiality
edward
then
went
back
to
his
work
and
this
evening
when
i
sent
him
a
dish
from
my
table
pickle
desired
the
servant
to
tell
me
that
he
had
hardly
any
fever
and
felt
so
which
in
the
negro
dialect
means
a
great
deal
i
begin
therefore
to
hope
that
we
shall
save
the
foolish
fellow
s
life
at
last
which
at
one
time
appeared
to
be
in
great
jeopardy
there
was
a
great
dinner
and
ball
for
the
whole
county
given
at
montego
bay
to
which
i
was
invited
but
i
begged
leave
to
decline
this
and
all
other
invitations
being
determined
to
give
up
my
whole
time
to
my
negroes
during
my
stay
in
jamaica
january
every
morning
my
agent
regales
me
with
some
fresh
instance
of
insubordination
he
says
nothing
plainly
but
shakes
his
head
and
evidently
gives
me
to
understand
that
the
estate
can
not
be
governed
properly
without
the
it
seems
that
this
morning
the
women
one
and
all
refused
to
carry
away
the
which
is
one
of
the
easiest
tasks
that
can
be
set
and
that
without
the
slightest
pretence
in
consequence
the
mill
was
obliged
to
be
stopped
and
when
the
driver
on
that
station
insisted
on
their
doing
their
duty
a
little
fierce
young
devil
of
a
miss
whaunica
flew
at
his
throat
and
endeavoured
to
strangle
him
the
agent
was
obliged
to
be
called
in
and
at
length
this
petticoat
rebellion
was
subdued
and
every
thing
went
on
as
usual
i
have
in
consequence
assured
the
women
that
since
they
will
not
be
managed
by
fair
treatment
i
must
have
recourse
to
other
measures
and
that
if
any
similar
instance
of
misconduct
should
take
place
i
was
determined
on
my
return
from
kingston
to
sell
the
most
refractory
ship
myself
immediately
for
england
and
never
return
to
them
and
jamaica
more
this
threat
at
the
time
seemed
to
produce
a
great
effect
all
hands
were
clasped
and
all
voices
were
raised
imploring
me
not
to
leave
them
and
assuring
me
that
in
future
they
would
do
their
work
quietly
and
willingly
but
whether
the
impression
will
last
beyond
the
immediate
moment
is
a
point
greatly
to
be
doubted
january
another
morning
with
the
mill
stopped
no
liquor
in
the
and
no
work
done
the
driver
brought
the
most
obstinate
and
insolent
of
the
women
to
be
lectured
by
me
and
i
bounced
and
stormed
for
half
an
hour
with
all
my
might
and
main
especially
at
whaunica
whose
ingratitude
was
peculiar
as
she
is
the
wife
of
edward
the
eboe
whom
i
had
been
protecting
against
the
charge
of
theft
and
obeahism
and
had
shown
him
more
than
usual
kindness
they
at
last
appeared
to
be
very
penitent
and
ashamed
of
themselves
and
engaged
never
to
behave
ill
again
if
i
would
but
forgive
them
this
present
fault
whaunica
in
particular
assuring
me
very
earnestly
that
i
never
should
have
cause
to
accuse
her
of
bad
manners
again
for
in
negro
dialect
ingratitude
is
always
called
bad
my
agent
declares
that
they
never
conducted
themselves
so
ill
before
that
they
worked
cheerfully
and
properly
till
my
arrival
but
now
they
think
that
i
shall
protect
them
against
all
punishment
and
have
made
regularly
ten
hogsheads
of
sugar
a
week
less
than
they
did
before
my
coming
upon
the
estate
this
is
the
more
provoking
as
by
delaying
the
conclusion
of
the
crop
the
latter
part
of
it
may
be
driven
into
the
rainy
season
and
then
the
labour
is
infinitely
more
severe
both
for
the
slaves
and
the
cattle
and
more
detrimental
to
their
health
the
minister
of
savannah
la
mar
has
shown
me
a
plan
for
the
religious
instruction
of
the
negroes
which
was
sent
to
him
by
the
ecclesiastical
commissaries
at
kingston
it
consisted
but
of
two
points
against
the
first
which
recommended
the
slaves
being
to
go
to
church
on
a
sunday
i
positively
declared
myself
sunday
is
now
the
absolute
property
of
the
negroes
for
their
relaxation
as
saturday
is
for
the
cultivation
of
their
grounds
and
i
will
not
suffer
a
single
hour
of
it
to
be
taken
from
them
for
any
purpose
whatever
if
my
slaves
choose
to
go
to
church
on
sundays
so
much
the
better
but
not
one
of
them
shall
be
to
do
one
earthly
thing
on
sundays
but
that
which
he
chooses
himself
the
second
article
recommended
occasional
pastoral
visits
of
the
minister
to
the
different
estates
and
in
this
respect
i
promised
to
give
him
every
facility
although
i
greatly
doubt
any
good
effect
being
produced
by
a
few
short
visits
at
considerable
intervals
on
the
minds
of
ignorant
creatures
to
whom
no
palpable
and
immediate
benefit
is
offered
it
appears
indeed
to
me
that
the
only
means
of
giving
the
negroes
morality
and
religion
must
be
through
the
medium
of
education
and
their
being
induced
to
read
such
books
in
the
minister
s
absence
as
may
recall
to
their
thoughts
what
they
have
heard
from
him
otherwise
he
may
talk
for
an
hour
and
they
will
have
understood
but
little
and
remember
nothing
there
is
not
a
single
negro
among
my
whole
three
hundred
who
can
read
a
line
and
what
i
suppose
to
be
wanted
on
estates
is
not
an
importation
of
missionaries
but
of
schoolmasters
on
bell
s
plan
if
it
could
by
any
means
be
introduced
here
with
effect
however
in
the
mean
while
i
told
the
minister
that
i
was
perfectly
well
inclined
to
have
every
measure
tried
that
might
enlighten
the
minds
of
the
negroes
provided
it
did
not
interfere
with
their
own
hours
of
leisure
and
were
not
compulsory
i
mentioned
to
him
a
plan
for
commencing
his
instructions
under
the
most
favourable
auspices
of
which
he
seemed
to
approve
and
he
has
promised
to
make
occasional
visits
on
my
estate
during
my
absence
which
may
do
good
and
can
do
no
harm
and
even
should
it
fail
to
make
the
negroes
religious
will
at
least
add
another
humane
inspector
to
my
list
soon
after
the
minister
s
departure
john
fuller
came
to
repair
one
of
the
windows
now
john
is
in
great
disgrace
with
me
in
one
respect
instead
of
having
a
wife
on
the
estate
he
keeps
one
at
the
bay
so
that
his
children
will
not
belong
to
me
phillis
too
who
formerly
lived
with
john
says
that
she
parted
with
him
because
he
threw
away
all
his
money
upon
the
bay
girls
though
john
asserts
that
the
cause
of
separation
was
his
catching
the
false
phillis
coming
out
of
one
of
the
bedrooms
however
it
is
certain
that
now
his
connections
are
all
at
the
bay
and
i
have
assured
him
that
if
he
does
not
provide
himself
with
a
wife
at
cornwall
before
my
return
from
kingston
i
will
put
him
up
to
auction
and
call
the
girls
together
to
bid
for
him
one
offering
half
a
dozen
yams
and
another
a
bit
of
salt
fish
and
the
highest
bidder
shall
carry
him
off
as
her
property
but
as
he
came
into
the
room
just
as
the
minister
left
it
i
told
him
that
pope
was
coming
to
give
the
negroes
some
instruction
and
that
he
had
left
part
of
a
catechism
for
him
which
he
was
to
get
by
heart
against
his
next
visit
john
promised
to
study
it
diligently
and
went
off
to
get
it
read
to
him
by
one
of
the
several
of
his
companions
came
to
hear
it
from
curiosity
and
the
read
aloud
john
fuller
is
gone
to
the
bay
boys
on
the
girls
to
spend
his
cash
and
when
john
fuller
comes
home
boys
john
fuller
deserves
the
so
john
went
away
shaking
his
head
and
saying
massa
had
told
him
that
the
minister
had
left
that
paper
to
make
him
a
better
christian
but
he
was
certain
that
the
minister
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
and
that
massa
had
made
it
all
himself
about
the
bay
january
sunday
i
shall
have
enough
to
do
in
jamaica
if
i
accept
all
the
offices
that
are
pressed
upon
me
a
large
body
of
negroes
from
a
neighbouring
estate
came
over
to
cornwall
this
morning
to
complain
of
hard
treatment
in
various
ways
from
their
overseer
and
drivers
and
requesting
me
to
represent
their
injuries
to
their
trustee
here
and
their
proprietor
in
england
the
charges
were
so
strong
that
i
am
certain
that
they
must
be
fictitious
however
i
listened
to
their
story
with
patience
promised
that
the
trustee
whom
i
was
to
see
in
a
few
days
should
know
their
complaint
and
they
went
away
apparently
satisfied
then
came
a
runaway
negro
who
wanted
to
return
home
and
requested
me
to
write
a
few
lines
to
his
master
to
save
him
from
the
lash
he
was
succeeded
by
a
poor
creature
named
bessie
who
although
still
a
young
woman
is
dispensed
with
from
labour
on
account
of
her
being
afflicted
with
the
one
of
the
most
horrible
of
negro
diseases
it
shows
itself
in
large
blotches
and
swellings
and
which
generally
by
degrees
moulder
away
the
joints
of
the
toes
and
fingers
till
they
rot
and
drop
off
sometimes
as
much
as
half
a
foot
will
go
at
once
as
the
disease
is
communicable
by
contact
the
person
so
afflicted
is
necessarily
shunned
by
society
and
this
poor
woman
who
is
married
to
john
fuller
one
of
the
best
young
men
on
the
estate
and
by
whom
she
has
had
four
children
although
they
are
all
dead
has
for
some
time
been
obliged
to
live
separated
from
him
lest
he
should
be
destroyed
by
contracting
the
same
complaint
she
now
came
to
tell
me
that
she
wanted
a
blanket
for
that
the
cold
killed
her
of
nights
cold
being
that
which
negroes
dislike
most
and
from
which
most
of
their
illnesses
arise
of
course
she
got
her
blanket
then
she
said
that
she
wanted
medicine
for
her
complaint
had
not
the
doctor
seen
her
oh
yes
goodwin
but
the
white
doctor
could
do
her
no
good
she
wanted
to
go
to
a
black
doctor
named
ormond
who
belonged
to
a
neighbouring
i
told
her
that
if
this
black
doctor
understood
her
particular
disease
better
than
others
certainly
she
should
go
to
him
but
that
if
he
pretended
to
cure
her
by
charms
or
spells
or
any
thing
but
medicine
i
should
desire
his
master
to
cure
the
black
doctor
by
giving
him
the
punishment
proper
for
such
an
impostor
upon
this
bessie
burst
into
tears
and
said
that
ormond
was
not
an
obeah
man
and
that
she
had
suffered
too
much
by
obeah
men
to
wish
to
have
any
more
to
do
with
them
she
had
made
adam
her
enemy
by
betraying
him
when
he
had
attempted
to
poison
the
former
attorney
he
had
then
cursed
her
and
wished
that
she
might
never
be
hearty
again
and
from
that
very
time
her
complaint
had
declared
itself
and
her
poor
pickaninies
had
all
died
away
one
after
another
and
she
was
sure
that
it
was
adam
who
had
done
all
this
mischief
by
upon
this
i
put
myself
in
a
great
rage
and
asked
her
how
she
could
believe
that
god
would
suffer
a
low
wicked
fellow
like
adam
to
make
good
people
die
merely
because
he
wished
them
dead
she
did
not
know
she
knew
nothing
about
god
had
never
heard
of
any
such
being
nor
of
any
other
i
told
her
that
god
was
a
great
personage
who
lived
up
yonder
above
the
blue
in
a
place
full
of
pleasures
and
free
from
pains
where
adam
and
wicked
people
could
not
come
that
her
pickaninies
were
not
dead
for
ever
but
were
only
gone
up
to
live
with
god
who
was
good
and
would
take
care
of
them
for
her
and
that
if
she
were
good
when
she
died
she
too
would
go
up
to
god
above
the
blue
and
see
all
her
four
pickaninies
the
idea
seemed
so
new
and
so
agreeable
to
the
poor
creature
that
she
clapped
her
hands
together
and
began
laughing
for
joy
so
i
said
to
her
every
thing
that
i
could
imagine
likely
to
remove
her
prejudice
told
her
that
i
should
make
it
a
crime
even
so
much
as
to
mention
the
word
obeah
on
the
estate
and
that
if
any
negro
from
that
time
forward
should
be
proved
to
have
accused
another
of
obeahing
him
or
of
telling
another
that
he
had
been
obeahed
he
should
forfeit
his
share
of
the
next
present
of
which
i
meant
soon
to
distribute
among
the
slaves
and
should
never
receive
any
favour
from
me
in
future
so
i
gave
bessie
a
piece
of
money
and
she
seemed
to
go
away
in
better
spirits
than
she
came
this
adam
of
whom
she
complained
is
a
most
dangerous
fellow
and
the
terror
of
all
his
companions
with
whom
he
lives
in
a
constant
state
of
warfare
he
is
a
creole
born
on
my
own
property
and
has
several
sisters
who
have
obtained
their
freedom
and
are
in
every
respect
creditable
and
praiseworthy
and
to
one
of
whom
i
consider
myself
as
particularly
indebted
as
she
was
the
means
of
saving
poor
richard
s
life
when
the
tyranny
of
the
overseer
had
brought
him
almost
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
but
this
brother
is
in
every
thing
the
very
reverse
of
his
sisters
there
is
no
doubt
of
his
having
as
bessie
stated
infused
poison
into
the
through
spite
against
the
late
superintendent
it
was
this
same
fellow
whom
edward
suspected
of
having
put
into
his
s
head
the
idea
of
his
having
been
bewitched
and
it
was
also
in
his
hut
that
the
old
obeah
man
was
found
concealed
whom
my
attorney
seized
and
transported
last
year
he
is
unfortunately
clever
and
plausible
and
i
am
told
that
the
mischief
which
he
has
already
done
by
working
upon
the
folly
and
superstition
of
his
fellows
is
incalculable
yet
i
can
not
get
rid
of
him
the
law
will
not
suffer
any
negro
to
be
shipped
off
the
island
until
he
shall
have
been
convicted
of
felony
at
the
sessions
i
can
not
sell
him
for
nobody
would
buy
him
nor
even
accept
him
if
i
would
offer
them
so
dangerous
a
present
if
he
were
to
go
away
the
law
would
seize
him
and
bring
him
back
to
me
and
i
should
be
obliged
to
pay
heavily
for
his
and
his
maintenance
in
the
workhouse
in
short
i
know
not
what
i
can
do
with
him
except
indeed
make
a
christian
of
him
this
might
induce
the
negroes
to
believe
that
he
had
lost
his
infernal
power
by
the
superior
virtue
of
the
holy
water
but
perhaps
he
may
refuse
to
be
christened
however
i
will
at
least
ask
him
the
question
and
if
he
consents
i
will
send
him
and
a
couple
of
dollars
to
the
clergyman
for
he
shall
not
have
so
great
a
distinction
as
baptism
from
massa
s
own
hand
and
see
what
effect
white
obeah
will
have
in
removing
the
terrors
of
this
professor
of
the
black
as
to
my
sick
obeah
patient
pickle
from
the
moment
of
his
reconciliation
with
his
he
began
to
mend
and
has
recovered
with
wonderful
rapidity
the
fellow
seems
grateful
for
the
pains
which
i
have
taken
about
him
and
our
difficulty
now
is
to
prevent
his
fancying
himself
too
soon
able
to
quit
the
hospital
so
eager
is
he
to
return
to
work
for
there
are
certainly
many
excellent
qualities
in
the
negro
character
their
worst
faults
appear
to
be
this
prejudice
respecting
obeah
and
the
facility
with
which
they
are
frequently
induced
to
poison
to
the
right
hand
and
to
the
left
a
neighbouring
gentleman
as
i
hear
has
now
three
negroes
in
prison
all
domestics
and
one
of
them
grown
grey
in
his
service
for
poisoning
him
with
corrosive
sublimate
his
brother
was
actually
killed
by
similar
means
yet
i
am
assured
that
both
of
them
were
reckoned
men
of
great
humanity
another
agent
who
appears
to
be
in
high
favour
with
the
negroes
whom
he
now
governs
was
obliged
to
quit
an
estate
from
the
frequent
attempts
to
poison
him
and
a
person
against
whom
there
is
no
sort
of
charge
alleged
for
tyranny
after
being
brought
to
the
doors
of
death
by
a
cup
of
coffee
only
escaped
a
second
time
by
his
civility
in
giving
the
beverage
prepared
for
himself
to
two
young
to
both
of
whom
it
proved
fatal
it
indeed
came
out
afterwards
that
this
crime
was
also
effected
by
the
abominable
belief
in
obeah
the
woman
who
mixed
the
draught
had
no
idea
of
its
being
poison
but
she
had
received
the
deleterious
ingredients
from
an
obeah
man
as
a
charm
to
make
her
massa
good
to
her
by
which
the
negroes
mean
the
compelling
a
person
to
give
another
every
thing
for
which
that
other
may
ask
him
next
to
this
vile
trick
of
poisoning
people
arising
doubtless
in
a
great
measure
from
their
total
want
of
religion
and
their
ignorance
of
a
future
state
which
makes
them
dread
no
punishment
hereafter
for
themselves
and
look
with
but
little
respect
on
human
life
in
others
the
greatest
drawback
upon
one
s
comfort
in
a
jamaica
existence
seems
to
me
to
be
the
being
obliged
to
live
perpetually
in
public
certainly
if
a
man
was
desirous
of
leading
a
life
of
vice
he
must
have
set
himself
totally
above
shame
for
he
may
depend
upon
every
thing
done
by
him
being
seen
and
known
the
houses
are
absolutely
transparent
the
walls
are
nothing
but
windows
and
all
the
doors
stand
wide
open
no
servants
are
in
waiting
to
announce
arrivals
visiters
negroes
dogs
cats
poultry
all
walk
in
and
out
and
up
and
down
your
without
the
slightest
ceremony
even
the
temple
of
cloacina
which
by
the
bye
is
here
very
elegantly
spoken
of
generally
as
temple
is
as
much
latticed
and
as
pervious
to
the
eye
as
any
other
part
of
my
premises
and
many
a
time
has
my
delicacy
been
put
to
the
blush
by
the
civility
of
some
old
woman
or
other
who
wandering
that
way
and
happening
to
cast
her
eye
to
the
left
has
stopped
her
course
to
curtsy
very
gravely
and
pay
me
the
passing
compliment
of
an
ah
massa
bless
you
massa
how
day
january
i
find
that
bessie
s
black
doctor
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
professor
of
medicine
as
to
this
particular
disease
and
i
have
ordered
her
to
be
sent
to
him
in
the
mountains
immediately
several
gentlemen
of
the
county
dined
with
me
and
when
they
left
me
one
of
the
carriages
contrived
to
get
overturned
and
the
right
shoulder
of
one
of
the
gentlemen
was
dislocated
luckily
it
happened
close
to
the
house
and
as
the
physician
who
attends
my
estate
had
dined
with
me
also
a
boy
on
a
mule
was
despatched
after
him
with
all
haste
he
was
soon
with
us
the
bone
was
replaced
with
perfect
ease
and
this
morning
the
patient
left
me
with
every
prospect
of
finding
no
bad
effects
whatever
from
his
accident
we
had
at
dinner
a
land
tortoise
and
a
barbecued
pig
two
of
the
best
and
richest
dishes
that
i
ever
tasted
the
latter
in
particular
which
was
dressed
in
the
true
maroon
fashion
being
placed
on
a
barbecue
a
frame
of
through
whose
interstices
the
steam
can
ascend
filled
with
peppers
and
spices
of
the
highest
flavour
wrapt
in
plantain
leaves
and
then
buried
in
a
hole
filled
with
hot
stones
by
whose
vapour
it
is
baked
no
particle
of
the
juice
being
thus
suffered
to
evaporate
i
have
eaten
several
other
good
jamaica
dishes
but
none
so
excellent
as
this
a
large
portion
of
which
was
transferred
to
the
most
infirm
patients
in
the
hospital
perhaps
an
english
physician
would
have
felt
every
hair
of
his
wig
bristle
upon
his
head
with
astonishment
at
hearing
me
ask
this
morning
a
woman
in
a
fever
how
her
bark
and
her
barbe
cued
pig
had
agreed
with
her
but
with
negroes
i
find
that
feeding
the
sick
upon
stewed
fish
and
pork
highly
seasoned
produces
the
very
best
effects
possible
some
of
the
fruits
here
are
excellent
such
as
shaddocks
oranges
granadelloes
forbidden
fruit
and
one
between
an
orange
and
a
lemon
called
the
grape
or
cluster
fruit
appears
to
me
quite
delicious
for
the
vegetables
i
can
not
say
so
much
yams
plantains
cocoa
poyers
bananas
look
and
taste
all
so
much
alike
that
i
scarcely
know
one
from
the
other
they
are
all
something
between
bread
and
potatoes
not
so
good
as
either
and
i
am
quite
tired
of
them
all
the
lima
bean
is
said
to
be
more
like
a
pea
than
a
bean
but
whatever
it
be
like
it
appeared
to
me
very
indifferent
as
to
peas
themselves
nothing
can
be
worse
the
achie
fruit
is
a
kind
of
vegetable
which
generally
is
fried
in
butter
many
people
i
am
told
are
fond
of
it
but
i
could
find
no
merit
in
it
the
or
abba
as
it
is
called
here
produces
a
long
scarlet
or
reddish
brown
cone
which
separates
into
beads
each
of
which
contains
a
roasting
nut
surrounded
by
a
kind
of
stringy
husk
which
being
boiled
in
salt
and
water
upon
being
chewn
has
a
taste
of
artichoke
but
the
consistence
is
very
disagreeable
the
only
native
vegetable
which
i
like
much
is
the
ochra
which
tastes
like
asparagus
though
not
with
quite
so
delicate
a
flavour
as
to
fish
the
variety
is
endless
but
i
think
it
rather
consists
in
variety
of
names
than
of
flavour
from
this
however
i
must
except
the
and
and
above
all
the
which
is
almost
the
best
fish
that
i
ever
tasted
all
the
that
i
have
met
with
as
yet
have
been
excellent
the
oysters
have
not
come
in
my
way
but
i
am
told
that
they
are
not
only
poor
and
insipid
but
frequently
are
so
poisonous
that
i
had
better
not
venture
upon
them
and
so
ends
this
chapter
of
the
almanach
des
gourmands
for
jamaica
january
there
were
above
twenty
ladies
literally
at
my
feet
this
morning
i
went
down
to
the
to
speak
to
bessie
about
going
to
her
black
doctor
and
all
the
refractory
females
of
last
week
heard
of
my
being
there
and
came
in
a
body
to
promise
better
conduct
for
the
future
and
implore
me
not
to
go
away
the
sight
of
my
carriage
getting
ready
to
take
me
to
kingston
and
the
arrival
of
had
alarmed
them
with
the
idea
that
i
was
really
going
to
put
my
threats
into
execution
of
leaving
them
for
ever
they
had
artfully
enough
prevailed
on
the
wife
of
clifford
the
driver
whom
whannica
had
collared
to
be
their
and
they
begged
and
lifted
up
their
folded
hands
and
cried
and
fell
on
the
ground
and
kissed
my
feet
and
in
short
acted
their
part
so
well
that
they
almost
made
me
act
mine
to
perfection
and
fall
to
blubbering
i
told
them
that
i
certainly
should
go
to
kingston
on
thursday
but
if
i
had
good
accounts
of
them
during
my
absence
i
should
return
in
a
few
days
if
on
the
contrary
the
idle
negroes
continued
to
refuse
to
work
without
compulsion
then
in
justice
to
the
good
ones
who
last
week
were
obliged
to
do
more
than
their
share
those
punishments
which
i
had
stopped
must
be
resumed
but
that
as
cornwall
would
be
unsupportable
to
me
if
i
could
not
live
there
without
hearing
the
crack
of
the
abominable
all
day
long
i
would
not
return
to
it
but
ship
myself
off
for
england
and
never
visit
them
or
jamaica
any
more
and
then
i
talked
very
sternly
and
positively
about
punishments
and
making
bad
negroes
do
their
work
properly
and
every
third
word
was
the
till
i
almost
fancied
myself
the
princess
in
the
fairy
tale
who
never
opened
her
mouth
but
out
came
two
toads
and
three
couple
of
serpents
however
to
sweeten
my
oration
a
little
at
the
end
i
told
them
that
having
enquired
closely
into
the
characters
of
the
present
i
had
found
no
charge
against
any
of
them
except
one
who
was
accused
of
having
occasionally
struck
a
negro
of
using
bad
language
to
them
and
of
being
a
hasty
passionate
man
though
in
other
respects
very
serviceable
to
the
estate
but
although
these
faults
were
but
trifling
and
some
of
them
not
proved
so
determined
was
i
to
show
that
i
would
suffer
no
white
person
on
the
estate
who
maltreated
the
negroes
either
by
word
or
deed
that
i
had
determined
to
make
an
example
of
him
for
the
warning
of
the
rest
and
accordingly
had
dismissed
him
this
the
man
in
question
by
his
own
account
had
made
himself
obnoxious
to
them
and
on
hearing
of
his
discharge
they
one
and
all
sprawled
upon
the
ground
in
such
a
rapture
of
joy
and
gratitude
that
now
i
may
safely
say
with
sir
andrew
aguecheek
i
was
adored
once
the
had
denied
positively
the
charge
of
striking
the
negroes
and
ascribed
it
to
the
revenge
of
the
eboe
edward
whom
he
had
detected
in
cutting
out
part
of
a
window
in
order
that
he
might
pass
out
stolen
sugar
unperceived
for
to
do
the
negroes
justice
it
is
a
doubt
whether
they
are
the
greatest
thieves
or
liars
and
the
quantity
of
sugar
which
they
purloin
during
the
crop
and
dispose
of
at
the
bay
for
a
mere
trifle
is
enormous
however
whether
the
charge
of
striking
were
true
or
not
it
was
sufficiently
proved
that
this
was
a
passionate
man
and
he
said
himself
that
the
negroes
had
conceived
a
spite
against
him
which
alone
were
reasons
enough
for
removing
him
indeed
i
had
the
less
scruple
from
the
slight
nature
of
his
offence
making
it
easy
for
him
to
find
another
situation
and
i
have
besides
desired
him
to
stay
out
his
quarter
on
the
estate
and
then
receive
a
double
salary
on
going
away
which
will
free
him
from
any
charge
of
having
been
dismissed
disgracefully
january
i
went
to
enquire
after
my
petitioners
juliet
and
delia
and
had
the
satisfaction
to
find
that
the
trustee
had
enquired
into
their
complaint
and
as
it
appeared
not
to
be
entirely
unfounded
he
had
done
every
thing
that
was
right
and
necessary
aberdeen
too
the
runaway
cooper
who
had
applied
to
me
to
obtain
his
pardon
had
been
suffered
to
return
to
his
work
unpunished
and
as
it
had
been
found
that
his
flight
had
in
a
great
measure
been
occasioned
by
his
being
in
a
bad
state
of
health
which
rendered
him
apprehensive
of
being
put
to
labour
beyond
his
strength
he
had
been
permitted
to
select
his
own
occupation
which
of
course
was
the
easiest
one
in
his
trade
but
i
found
it
a
more
difficult
matter
to
ascertain
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
charges
brought
to
me
on
sunday
last
the
books
positively
contradicted
them
but
the
register
might
have
been
falsely
kept
and
as
the
negroes
persisted
most
positively
in
their
complaint
against
the
overseer
particularly
as
to
his
having
curtailed
them
of
the
legal
allowance
of
time
for
their
meals
and
the
cultivation
of
their
own
grounds
with
the
concurrence
of
the
trustee
i
wrote
to
the
magistrates
of
the
county
desiring
that
they
would
summon
the
negroes
in
question
before
a
council
of
protection
and
examine
into
the
injuries
of
which
they
had
complained
to
me
february
thursday
i
left
cornwall
for
spanish
town
at
six
in
the
morning
accompanied
by
a
young
naval
officer
the
son
of
my
next
neighbour
hill
of
amity
who
not
only
was
good
enough
to
lend
me
a
kittereen
with
a
canopy
to
perform
my
journey
but
his
son
to
be
my
on
my
tour
the
road
wound
through
mountain
passes
or
else
on
a
shelf
of
rock
so
narrow
though
without
the
slightest
danger
that
one
of
the
wheels
was
frequently
in
the
sea
while
my
other
side
was
fenced
by
a
line
of
bold
broken
cliffs
clothed
with
trees
completely
from
their
brows
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
water
between
eight
and
nine
we
reached
a
solitary
tavern
called
where
the
horses
rested
for
a
couple
of
hours
it
had
a
very
pretty
garden
on
the
which
contained
a
picturesque
cottage
exactly
resembling
an
ornamental
hermitage
and
leaning
against
one
of
the
pillars
of
its
porch
we
found
a
young
girl
who
exactly
answered
george
colman
s
description
of
yarico
quite
brown
but
extremely
genteel
like
a
wedgewood
she
told
us
that
she
was
a
spanish
creole
who
had
fled
with
her
mother
from
the
disputes
between
the
royalists
and
independents
in
the
island
of
old
providence
and
the
owner
of
the
tavern
being
a
relation
of
her
mother
he
had
permitted
the
fugitives
to
establish
themselves
in
his
till
the
troubles
of
their
own
country
should
be
over
she
talked
perfectly
good
english
for
she
said
that
there
were
many
of
that
nation
established
in
providence
her
name
was
antonietta
her
figure
was
light
and
elegant
her
black
eyes
mild
and
bright
her
countenance
intelligent
and
and
her
teeth
beautiful
to
perfection
altogether
antonietta
was
by
far
the
handsomest
creole
that
i
have
ever
seen
from
we
proceeded
at
once
to
lakovia
a
small
village
a
stage
of
thirty
miles
here
we
found
a
relay
of
horses
which
conveyed
us
by
seven
o
clock
to
the
gutturs
a
house
belonging
to
the
proprietor
of
the
and
which
is
situated
at
the
very
foot
of
the
tremendous
mountains
the
house
is
an
excellent
one
and
we
found
good
beds
eatables
and
in
short
every
thing
that
travellers
could
wish
the
distance
from
lakovia
to
the
gutturs
is
sixteen
miles
february
yesterday
the
only
very
striking
point
of
view
although
the
whole
of
the
road
was
picturesque
was
the
cove
situated
between
and
lakovia
and
which
resembled
the
most
beautiful
of
the
views
of
coves
to
be
found
in
cook
s
voyages
but
our
journey
was
a
succession
of
beautiful
scenes
from
beginning
to
end
instantly
on
leaving
the
gutturs
we
began
to
ascend
the
mountains
and
it
was
not
till
after
travelling
for
five
and
twenty
miles
that
we
found
ourselves
at
the
foot
of
them
on
the
other
side
at
a
place
called
williamsfield
about
twelve
miles
from
the
where
we
rested
for
the
night
to
be
sure
the
road
was
so
rough
that
it
was
enough
to
make
one
envy
the
mahometan
women
who
having
no
souls
at
all
could
not
possibly
have
them
jolted
out
of
their
bodies
but
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
amply
rewarded
us
for
our
bruised
sides
and
battered
backs
the
road
was
for
the
most
part
bounded
by
lofty
rocks
on
one
side
and
a
deep
precipice
on
the
other
and
bordered
with
a
profusion
of
noble
trees
and
flowering
shrubs
in
great
variety
in
particular
i
was
struck
with
the
picturesque
appearance
of
some
wild
of
singular
size
and
beauty
although
there
were
only
two
of
us
besides
servants
we
found
it
necessary
to
employ
seven
horses
and
a
couple
of
mules
and
as
our
cavalcade
wound
along
through
the
mountains
the
spanish
look
of
our
and
of
our
kittereens
which
are
precisely
the
vehicle
in
which
gil
bias
is
always
represented
when
travelling
with
scipio
towards
lirias
gave
us
quite
the
appearance
of
a
caravan
nor
should
i
have
been
greatly
surprised
to
see
a
open
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
captain
rolando
s
whiskers
make
their
appearance
every
one
spoke
to
me
with
contempt
of
this
south
road
in
respect
of
beauty
when
compared
with
the
north
however
it
certainly
seemed
to
me
more
beautiful
than
any
road
which
i
have
ever
travelled
as
yet
february
a
stage
of
twenty
miles
brought
us
to
old
harbour
and
passing
through
the
dry
river
twelve
more
landed
us
at
spanish
town
otherwise
called
jago
de
la
vega
and
the
seat
of
government
in
jamaica
although
kingston
is
much
larger
and
more
populous
and
must
be
considered
as
the
principal
town
we
found
very
clean
and
comfortable
lodgings
at
miss
cole
s
spanish
town
has
no
recommendations
whatever
the
houses
are
mostly
built
of
wood
the
streets
are
very
irregular
and
narrow
every
alternate
building
is
in
a
ruinous
state
and
the
whole
place
wears
an
air
of
gloom
and
melancholy
the
government
house
is
a
large
brick
building
with
a
portico
the
stucco
of
which
has
suffered
by
the
weather
and
it
can
advance
no
pretensions
to
architectural
beauty
on
one
side
of
the
square
in
which
it
stands
there
is
a
small
temple
protecting
a
statue
of
lord
rodney
executed
by
bacon
some
of
the
on
the
pedestal
appeared
to
me
very
good
but
the
old
admiral
is
most
absurdly
dressed
in
the
habit
of
a
roman
general
and
furnished
out
with
buskins
and
a
truncheon
the
temple
itself
is
quite
in
opposition
to
good
taste
with
very
low
arches
surmounted
by
heavy
bas
reliefs
out
of
all
proportion
february
sunday
we
breakfasted
with
the
chief
justice
who
is
my
relation
and
of
my
own
name
and
then
went
to
the
church
which
is
a
very
handsome
one
the
walls
lined
with
fine
mahogany
and
ornamented
with
many
monuments
of
white
marble
in
memory
of
the
former
governors
and
other
principal
inhabitants
it
seems
that
my
ancestors
on
both
sides
have
always
had
a
taste
for
being
well
lodged
after
their
decease
for
on
admiring
one
of
these
tombs
it
proved
to
be
that
of
my
maternal
grandfather
but
still
this
was
not
to
be
compared
for
a
moment
with
my
mausoleum
at
cornwall
after
church
i
went
home
with
the
rector
who
is
one
of
the
ecclesiastical
commissaries
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
him
respecting
a
plan
which
is
in
agitation
for
giving
the
negroes
something
of
a
religious
education
we
afterwards
dined
with
the
member
for
westmoreland
and
as
every
body
in
jamaica
is
on
foot
by
six
in
the
morning
at
ten
in
the
evening
we
were
quite
ready
to
go
to
bed
february
the
chief
justice
went
with
me
to
kingston
where
i
had
appointed
the
agent
for
my
other
estate
in
to
meet
me
the
short
time
allotted
for
my
stay
in
the
island
makes
it
impossible
to
attend
properly
both
to
this
estate
and
to
cornwall
at
this
first
visit
and
therefore
i
determined
to
confine
my
attention
to
the
negroes
on
the
latter
estate
till
my
return
to
jamaica
i
now
contented
myself
by
impressing
on
the
mind
of
my
agent
whom
i
am
certain
of
being
a
most
humane
and
intelligent
man
my
extreme
anxiety
for
the
abolition
of
the
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
from
him
that
for
a
long
time
it
had
never
been
used
more
than
perhaps
twice
in
the
year
and
then
only
very
slightly
and
for
some
offence
so
flagrant
that
it
was
impossible
to
pass
it
over
and
he
assured
me
that
whenever
i
visit
hordley
i
may
depend
upon
its
not
being
employed
at
all
on
the
other
hand
i
am
told
that
a
gentleman
of
the
parish
of
vere
who
came
over
to
jamaica
for
the
sole
purpose
of
ameliorating
the
condition
of
his
negroes
after
abolishing
the
has
at
length
been
constrained
to
resume
the
occasional
use
of
it
because
he
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
keep
them
in
any
sort
of
subordination
without
it
there
is
not
that
air
of
melancholy
about
kingston
which
pervades
spanish
town
but
it
has
no
pretensions
to
beauty
and
if
any
person
will
imagine
a
large
town
entirely
composed
of
booths
at
a
and
the
streets
merely
roads
without
any
sort
of
paving
he
will
have
a
perfect
idea
of
kingston
february
the
jamaica
canoes
are
hollowed
we
embarked
in
one
of
them
at
six
in
the
morning
and
visited
the
ruins
of
port
royal
which
last
year
was
destroyed
by
fire
some
of
the
houses
were
rebuilding
but
it
was
a
melancholy
sight
not
only
from
the
look
of
the
buildings
but
the
dejected
countenances
of
the
ruined
inhabitants
i
returned
to
breakfast
at
the
rectory
with
two
other
ecclesiastical
commissaries
had
more
conversation
about
their
proposed
plan
and
became
still
more
convinced
of
the
difficulty
of
doing
any
thing
effectual
without
danger
to
the
island
and
to
the
negroes
themselves
and
of
the
extreme
delicacy
requisite
in
whatever
may
be
attempted
we
afterwards
visited
the
school
of
the
children
of
the
poor
who
are
educating
upon
bell
s
system
and
then
saw
the
church
a
very
large
and
handsome
one
on
the
inside
but
mean
enough
as
to
its
exterior
i
was
shown
the
tombstone
of
admiral
benbow
who
was
killed
in
a
naval
engagement
and
whose
ship
afterwards
bore
down
to
port
royal
where
the
people
flocked
very
much
to
see
brave
admiral
benbow
laid
in
kingston
town
church
as
the
admiral
s
homer
informs
us
the
church
is
a
large
one
but
it
is
going
to
be
still
further
extended
the
negroes
in
kingston
and
its
neighbourhood
being
as
the
rector
assured
me
so
anxious
to
obtain
religious
instruction
that
on
sundays
not
only
the
church
but
the
churchyard
is
so
completely
thronged
with
them
as
to
make
it
difficult
to
traverse
the
crowd
and
those
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
seats
for
the
morning
service
through
fear
of
being
excluded
from
that
of
the
evening
never
stir
out
of
the
church
during
the
whole
day
they
also
flock
to
be
baptized
in
great
numbers
and
many
have
lately
come
to
be
married
and
their
burials
and
christenings
are
performed
with
great
pomp
and
solemnity
one
of
the
most
intelligent
of
the
negroes
with
whom
i
have
yet
conversed
was
the
coxswain
of
my
port
royal
canoe
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
been
christened
he
answered
no
he
did
not
yet
think
himself
good
enough
but
he
hoped
to
be
so
in
time
nor
was
he
married
for
he
was
still
young
and
afraid
that
he
could
not
break
off
his
bad
habits
and
be
contented
to
live
with
no
other
woman
than
his
wife
and
so
he
thought
it
better
not
to
become
a
christian
till
he
could
feel
certain
of
performing
the
duties
of
it
however
he
said
he
had
at
least
cured
himself
of
one
bad
custom
and
never
worked
upon
sundays
except
on
some
very
urgent
necessity
i
asked
what
he
did
on
sundays
instead
did
he
go
to
church
no
or
employ
himself
in
learning
to
read
oh
no
though
he
thought
being
able
to
read
a
great
which
was
his
constant
expression
for
any
thing
right
pleasant
or
profitable
but
he
had
no
leisure
to
learn
no
week
days
and
as
he
had
heard
the
parson
say
that
sunday
ought
to
be
a
day
of
rest
he
made
a
point
of
doing
nothing
at
all
on
that
day
he
praised
his
former
master
of
whose
son
he
was
now
the
property
and
said
that
neither
of
them
had
ever
occasion
to
lay
a
finger
on
him
he
worked
as
a
waterman
and
paid
his
master
ten
shillings
a
week
the
rest
of
his
earnings
being
his
own
profit
and
when
he
owed
wages
for
three
months
if
he
brought
two
his
master
would
always
give
him
time
for
the
remainder
and
that
in
so
kind
a
manner
that
he
always
fretted
himself
to
think
that
so
kind
a
master
should
wait
for
his
rights
and
worked
twice
as
hard
till
the
debt
was
discharged
he
said
that
kindness
was
the
only
way
to
make
good
negroes
and
that
if
failed
flogging
would
never
succeed
and
he
advised
me
when
i
found
my
negro
worthless
to
sell
him
at
once
and
not
stay
to
flog
him
and
so
by
spoiling
his
appearance
make
him
sell
for
less
for
blacks
must
not
be
treated
now
massa
as
they
used
to
be
they
can
think
and
hear
and
see
as
well
as
white
people
blacks
are
wiser
massa
than
they
were
and
will
soon
be
still
i
thought
the
fellow
himself
was
a
good
proof
of
his
assertion
i
left
kingston
at
two
o
clock
in
defiance
of
a
broiling
sun
reached
spanish
town
in
time
to
dine
with
the
and
went
afterwards
to
the
play
where
i
found
my
acquaintance
hill
of
covent
garden
theatre
performing
lord
william
in
the
haunted
tower
and
don
juan
in
the
pantomime
which
followed
the
theatre
is
neat
enough
but
i
am
told
very
inferior
in
splendour
to
that
in
kingston
as
to
the
performance
it
was
about
equal
to
any
provincial
theatricals
that
i
ever
saw
in
england
although
the
pieces
represented
were
by
no
means
well
selected
being
entirely
musical
and
the
orchestra
consisting
of
nothing
more
than
a
couple
of
fiddles
my
stay
in
spanish
town
has
been
too
short
to
admit
of
my
inspecting
the
antiquities
of
it
which
must
be
reserved
for
a
future
visit
although
i
never
intend
to
make
a
longer
than
the
present
the
difference
of
climate
was
very
sensible
both
at
spanish
town
and
kingston
and
the
suffocating
closeness
made
me
long
to
breathe
again
in
the
country
the
governor
happened
to
be
absent
on
a
tour
in
the
north
but
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
many
of
the
principal
persons
of
the
island
during
my
residence
here
and
the
civilities
which
i
received
from
all
of
them
were
not
only
more
than
i
expected
but
such
as
i
should
be
unreasonable
if
i
had
desired
more
and
very
ungrateful
if
i
could
ever
forget
them
february
we
were
to
return
by
the
north
road
and
set
out
at
six
in
the
morning
the
first
stage
was
to
the
west
tavern
nineteen
miles
and
nothing
can
be
imagined
at
once
more
sublime
and
more
beautiful
than
the
scenery
our
road
lay
along
the
banks
of
the
rio
cobre
which
runs
up
to
spanish
town
where
its
floods
frequently
commit
dreadful
ravages
large
masses
of
rock
intercept
its
current
at
small
intervals
which
as
well
as
its
shallowness
render
it
unnavigable
the
cliffs
and
trees
are
of
the
most
gigantic
size
and
the
road
goes
so
near
the
brink
of
a
tremendous
precipice
that
we
were
obliged
always
to
send
a
servant
forwards
to
warn
any
other
carriage
of
our
approach
in
order
that
it
might
stay
in
some
broader
part
while
we
passed
it
a
bridge
had
been
attempted
to
be
built
over
the
river
but
a
storm
had
demolished
it
before
its
completion
and
nothing
was
now
left
standing
but
a
single
enormous
arch
in
like
manner
the
dry
river
sets
all
bridges
at
defiance
when
we
crossed
it
between
old
harbour
and
spanish
town
it
was
nothing
but
a
waste
of
sand
but
its
floods
frequently
pour
down
with
irresistible
strength
and
rapidity
and
sometimes
render
it
impassable
for
weeks
together
i
was
extremely
delighted
with
the
first
ten
miles
of
this
stage
unluckily
a
mist
then
arose
so
thick
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
even
to
guess
at
the
surrounding
scenery
and
the
morning
was
so
cold
that
i
was
very
glad
to
wrap
myself
up
in
my
cloak
as
closely
as
if
i
had
been
travelling
in
an
english
december
by
the
time
of
our
leaving
the
west
tavern
the
mist
had
dispersed
and
i
was
able
to
ad
mire
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
mount
diavolo
which
we
were
then
crossing
though
we
had
left
the
river
the
road
was
still
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
running
along
the
edge
of
ravines
of
great
depth
and
filled
with
broken
masses
of
stone
and
trees
of
wonderful
magnitude
only
that
at
intervals
we
emerged
for
a
time
into
places
resembling
ornamental
parks
in
england
the
lawns
being
of
the
liveliest
verdure
the
ground
rising
and
falling
with
an
endless
variety
of
surface
and
enriched
with
a
profusion
of
trees
majestic
in
stature
and
picturesque
in
their
shapes
many
of
them
entirely
covered
with
the
beautiful
flowers
of
hogsmeat
and
other
creeping
plants
the
logwood
too
is
now
perfectly
golden
with
its
full
bloom
and
perfumes
all
the
air
and
nothing
can
be
more
gay
than
the
quantity
of
wild
flowers
which
catch
the
eye
on
all
sides
particularly
the
wild
pine
and
the
wild
ipecacuanha
we
travelled
for
sixteen
miles
which
brought
us
to
our
harbour
for
the
night
solitary
tavern
called
blackheath
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
of
anne
february
the
road
soon
brought
us
down
to
the
very
brink
of
the
sea
which
we
continued
to
skirt
during
the
whole
of
the
stage
it
then
brought
us
to
anne
s
bay
where
we
found
an
excellent
breakfast
at
an
inn
quite
in
the
english
fashion
for
the
landlady
had
been
long
resident
in
great
britain
every
thing
was
clean
and
comfortable
and
the
windows
looked
full
upon
the
sea
this
stage
was
sixteen
miles
the
next
was
said
to
be
but
from
the
time
which
we
took
to
travel
it
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
to
be
so
much
our
road
still
lay
by
the
till
we
began
to
ascend
the
mountain
of
rio
bueno
from
which
we
at
length
perceived
the
river
itself
running
into
the
sea
it
was
at
porto
bueno
that
columbus
is
said
to
have
made
his
first
landing
on
the
island
rio
bueno
is
a
small
town
with
a
fort
situated
close
to
the
sea
here
also
we
found
a
very
good
inn
kept
by
a
scotchman
the
present
landlady
her
father
being
from
home
was
a
very
pretty
brown
girl
by
name
eliza
thompson
she
told
me
that
she
was
only
residing
with
her
parents
during
her
absence
for
she
was
it
seems
the
wife
of
an
english
merchant
in
kingston
and
had
a
house
on
tachy
s
bridge
this
kind
of
establishment
is
the
highest
object
of
the
females
of
jamaica
they
seldom
marry
men
of
their
own
colour
but
lay
themselves
out
to
captivate
some
white
person
who
takes
them
for
mistresses
under
the
appellation
of
housekeepers
soon
after
my
arrival
at
cornwall
i
asked
my
attorney
whether
a
brown
woman
who
seemed
to
have
great
authority
in
the
house
belonged
to
me
no
she
was
a
free
was
she
in
my
service
then
no
she
was
not
in
my
service
i
began
to
grow
but
what
she
do
at
cornwall
of
what
use
is
she
in
the
house
why
sir
as
to
use
of
no
great
use
sir
and
then
after
a
pause
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
it
is
the
custom
sir
in
this
country
for
unmarried
men
to
have
housekeepers
and
nancy
is
but
he
was
unjust
in
saying
that
nancy
is
of
no
use
on
the
estate
for
she
is
perpetually
in
the
hospital
nurses
the
children
can
bleed
and
mix
up
medicines
and
as
i
am
assured
she
is
of
more
service
to
the
sick
than
all
the
doctors
these
brown
housekeepers
generally
attach
themselves
so
sincerely
to
the
interests
of
their
protectors
and
make
themselves
so
useful
that
they
in
common
retain
their
situation
and
their
children
if
slaves
are
always
honoured
by
their
fellows
with
the
title
of
miss
my
mulatto
housemaid
is
always
called
miss
polly
by
her
phillis
this
kind
of
connection
is
considered
by
a
brown
girl
in
the
same
light
as
marriage
they
will
tell
you
with
an
air
of
vanity
i
am
s
and
always
speak
of
him
as
being
her
and
i
am
told
that
except
on
these
terms
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
the
favours
of
a
woman
of
colour
to
gain
the
situation
of
housekeeper
to
a
white
man
the
mulatto
girl
directs
her
aim
this
makes
her
happiness
and
this
her
february
the
from
a
bridge
near
falmouth
was
remarkably
pleasing
a
stage
of
eighteen
miles
brought
us
to
the
town
itself
which
i
understand
to
be
in
size
the
second
in
the
island
however
various
are
the
characters
which
actors
sustain
i
find
their
own
to
be
the
same
every
where
although
the
jamaica
company
did
not
consist
of
more
than
twenty
persons
their
squabbles
had
divided
it
and
we
found
one
half
performing
at
falmouth
we
did
not
wait
for
the
play
but
proceeded
for
miles
to
montego
bay
where
i
once
more
found
myself
under
the
protecting
roof
of
miss
judy
james
on
our
return
from
dinner
at
dewer
s
we
discovered
a
ball
of
brown
ladies
and
gentlemen
opposite
to
the
inn
no
whites
nor
blacks
were
permitted
to
attend
this
assembly
but
as
our
landlady
had
two
nieces
there
under
her
auspices
we
were
allowed
to
be
spectators
the
females
chiefly
consisted
of
the
natural
daughters
of
attorneys
and
overseers
and
the
young
men
were
mostly
clerks
and
i
saw
nothing
at
all
to
be
compared
either
for
form
or
feature
to
many
of
the
humbler
people
of
colour
much
less
to
the
beautiful
spaniard
at
long
or
bryan
edwards
asserts
that
mulattos
never
breed
except
with
a
separate
black
or
white
but
at
this
ball
two
girls
were
pointed
out
to
me
the
daughters
of
mulatto
parents
and
i
have
been
assured
that
the
assertion
was
a
mistake
arising
from
such
a
connection
being
very
rarely
formed
the
females
generally
preferring
to
live
with
white
men
and
the
brown
men
having
thus
no
other
resource
than
black
women
as
to
the
above
girls
the
fact
is
certain
and
the
different
shades
of
colour
are
distinguished
by
too
plain
a
line
to
allow
any
suspicion
of
infidelity
on
the
part
of
their
parents
february
we
passed
the
day
at
plummer
s
estate
anchovy
bottom
when
lord
bolingbroke
was
resident
in
america
large
flocks
of
turkeys
used
to
ravage
his
but
from
their
extreme
wildness
he
never
could
make
any
of
them
prisoners
he
had
a
barn
lighted
by
a
large
sash
window
and
into
this
he
laid
a
train
of
corn
hiding
some
servants
with
guns
behind
the
large
doors
which
were
folded
back
the
turkeys
picked
up
the
corn
and
gradually
were
enticed
to
enter
the
barn
but
as
soon
as
a
dozen
had
passed
in
the
servants
clapped
the
doors
to
with
all
possible
expedition
now
they
reckoned
themselves
secure
of
their
game
but
to
their
utter
consternation
the
turkeys
in
a
body
darted
towards
the
light
dashed
against
the
glass
forced
out
the
and
away
went
turkeys
glass
and
all
february
sunday
i
reached
cornwall
about
three
o
clock
after
an
excursion
the
most
amusing
and
agreeable
that
i
ever
made
in
my
life
almost
every
step
of
the
road
presented
some
new
and
striking
scene
and
although
we
travelled
at
all
hours
and
with
as
little
circumspection
as
if
we
had
been
in
england
i
never
felt
a
headach
except
for
one
half
hour
on
my
arrival
i
found
the
satisfactory
intelligence
usually
communicated
to
west
indian
proprietors
my
estate
in
the
west
is
burnt
up
for
want
of
moisture
and
my
estate
in
the
east
has
been
so
completely
flooded
that
i
have
lost
a
whole
third
of
my
crop
at
cornwall
not
a
drop
of
rain
has
fallen
since
the
of
november
not
a
vestige
of
verdure
is
to
be
seen
and
we
begin
to
apprehend
a
famine
among
the
negroes
in
consequence
of
the
drought
destroying
their
provision
grounds
this
alone
is
wanting
to
complete
the
dangerous
state
of
the
island
where
the
higher
classes
are
all
in
the
utmost
alarm
at
rumours
of
wilberforce
s
intentions
to
set
the
negroes
entirely
at
freedom
the
next
step
to
which
would
be
in
all
probability
a
general
massacre
of
the
whites
and
a
second
part
of
the
horrors
of
domingo
while
on
the
other
hand
the
negroes
are
impatient
at
the
delay
and
such
disturbances
arose
in
thomas
s
in
the
east
last
christmas
as
required
the
interposition
of
the
magistrates
they
say
that
the
negroes
of
that
parish
had
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
regent
and
had
actually
determined
upon
setting
them
all
at
liberty
at
once
on
the
first
day
of
the
present
year
but
that
the
interference
of
the
island
had
defeated
the
plan
their
discontent
was
most
carefully
and
artfully
fomented
by
some
brown
methodists
who
held
secret
and
nightly
meetings
on
the
different
estates
and
did
their
best
to
mislead
and
bewilder
these
poor
creatures
with
their
fantastic
and
absurd
preaching
these
fellows
harp
upon
sin
and
the
devil
and
incessantly
and
describe
the
almighty
and
the
saviour
as
beings
so
terrible
that
many
of
their
proselytes
can
not
hear
the
name
of
christ
without
shuddering
one
poor
negro
on
one
of
my
own
estates
told
the
overseer
that
he
knew
himself
to
be
so
great
a
sinner
that
nothing
could
save
him
from
the
devil
s
clutches
even
for
a
few
hours
except
singing
hymns
and
he
kept
singing
so
incessantly
day
and
night
that
at
length
terror
and
want
of
sleep
turned
his
brain
and
the
wretch
died
raving
mad
february
a
sir
charles
price
who
had
an
estate
in
this
island
infested
by
rats
imported
with
much
trouble
a
very
large
and
strong
species
for
the
purpose
of
extirpating
the
others
the
answered
his
purpose
to
a
miracle
they
attacked
the
native
rats
with
such
spirit
that
in
a
short
time
they
had
the
whole
property
to
themselves
but
no
sooner
had
they
done
their
duty
upon
the
rats
than
they
extended
their
exertions
to
the
cats
of
whom
their
strength
and
size
at
length
enabled
them
completely
to
get
the
better
and
since
that
last
victory
sir
charles
price
s
rats
as
they
are
called
have
increased
so
prodigiously
that
like
the
man
in
scripture
who
got
rid
of
one
devil
and
was
taken
possession
of
by
seven
others
this
single
species
is
now
a
greater
nuisance
to
the
island
than
all
the
others
before
them
were
together
the
best
mode
of
destroying
rats
here
is
with
terriers
but
those
imported
from
england
soon
grow
useless
being
blinded
by
the
sun
while
their
puppies
born
in
jamaica
are
provided
by
nature
with
a
protecting
film
over
their
eyes
which
effectually
secures
them
against
incurring
that
calamity
february
poor
philippa
the
woman
who
used
always
to
call
me
her
husband
and
whom
i
left
sick
in
the
hospital
during
my
absence
has
gone
out
of
her
senses
and
there
can
not
well
happen
any
thing
more
distressing
as
there
is
no
separate
place
for
her
confinement
and
her
ravings
disturb
the
other
invalids
there
is
indeed
no
kind
of
bedlam
in
the
whole
island
of
jamaica
whether
this
proceeds
from
people
being
so
very
sedate
and
sensible
that
they
never
go
mad
or
from
their
all
being
so
mad
that
no
one
person
has
a
right
to
shut
up
another
for
being
out
of
his
senses
is
a
point
which
i
will
not
pretend
to
decide
one
of
my
domestic
negroes
a
boy
of
sixteen
named
prince
was
abandoned
by
his
worthless
mother
in
infancy
and
reared
by
this
philippa
and
since
her
illness
he
passes
every
moment
of
his
leisure
in
her
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
woman
named
christian
attending
two
fevered
children
in
the
hospital
one
her
own
and
the
other
an
adopted
infant
whom
she
reared
upon
the
death
of
its
mother
in
and
there
she
sits
throwing
her
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
with
such
unceasing
solicitude
that
no
one
could
discover
which
was
her
own
child
and
which
the
orphan
february
two
jamaica
nightingales
have
established
themselves
on
the
orange
tree
which
grows
against
my
window
and
their
song
is
most
beautiful
this
bird
is
also
called
the
from
its
facility
of
imitating
not
only
the
notes
of
every
other
animal
but
i
am
told
of
catching
every
tune
that
may
be
played
or
sung
two
or
three
times
in
the
house
near
which
it
resides
after
which
it
will
go
through
the
air
with
the
greatest
taste
and
precision
throwing
in
cadences
and
ornaments
that
catalani
herself
might
envy
but
by
far
the
most
curious
animal
that
i
have
yet
seen
in
jamaica
is
the
soldier
a
species
of
crab
which
inhabits
a
shell
like
a
snail
s
so
small
in
proportion
to
its
limbs
that
nothing
can
be
more
curious
or
admirable
than
the
machinery
by
which
it
is
enabled
to
fold
them
up
instantly
on
the
slightest
alarm
they
inhabit
the
mountains
but
regularly
once
a
year
travel
in
large
troops
down
to
the
seaside
to
spawn
and
change
their
shells
if
i
recollect
right
goldsmith
gives
a
very
full
and
entertaining
account
of
this
animal
by
the
name
of
the
soldier
they
are
seldom
used
in
jamaica
except
for
soups
which
are
reckoned
delicious
that
which
was
brought
to
me
was
a
very
small
one
the
shell
being
no
bigger
than
a
large
snail
s
although
the
animal
itself
when
marching
with
his
house
on
his
back
appears
to
be
above
thrice
the
size
but
i
am
told
that
they
are
frequently
as
large
as
a
man
s
fist
mine
was
found
alone
in
the
public
road
how
it
came
to
be
in
so
solitary
a
state
i
know
not
for
in
general
they
move
in
armies
and
march
towards
the
sea
in
a
straight
line
i
am
afraid
by
his
being
found
alone
that
my
soldier
must
have
been
a
deserter
february
there
was
a
shower
of
rain
for
the
first
time
since
my
arrival
indeed
not
a
drop
has
fallen
since
the
of
november
and
in
consequence
my
present
crop
has
suffered
terribly
and
our
expectations
for
next
season
are
still
worse
february
sunday
the
rain
has
brought
forth
the
and
in
the
evening
the
hedges
are
all
brilliant
with
their
numbers
in
the
day
they
seem
to
be
torpid
beetles
of
a
dull
reddish
colour
but
at
night
they
become
of
a
shining
purple
the
fire
proceeds
from
two
small
spots
in
the
back
part
of
the
head
it
is
yellow
in
the
light
and
requires
motion
to
throw
out
its
radiance
in
perfection
but
as
soon
as
it
is
touched
the
fly
struggles
violently
and
bends
itself
together
with
a
clicking
noise
like
the
snap
of
a
spring
and
i
understand
that
this
effort
is
necessary
to
set
it
in
motion
it
is
sufficiently
strong
to
turn
itself
upwards
with
a
single
movement
if
lying
on
its
back
some
people
say
that
it
is
always
obliged
to
throw
itself
upon
its
back
in
order
to
take
wing
but
this
i
have
again
heard
others
contradict
when
confined
in
a
glass
the
light
seems
almost
extinguished
nothing
can
be
discerned
but
two
pale
yellow
spots
but
on
being
pressed
by
the
hand
it
becomes
more
brilliant
than
any
emerald
and
when
on
the
wing
it
seems
entirely
composed
of
the
most
beautifully
coloured
fire
february
i
attended
the
slave
court
where
a
negro
was
tried
for
and
a
black
servant
girl
for
attempting
to
poison
her
master
the
former
was
sentenced
to
be
transported
the
latter
was
a
girl
of
fifteen
called
minetta
she
acknowledged
the
having
infused
corrosive
sublimate
in
some
brandy
and
water
but
asserted
that
she
had
taken
it
from
the
medicine
chest
without
knowing
it
to
be
poison
and
had
given
it
to
her
master
at
her
grandmother
s
desire
this
account
was
evidently
a
fabrication
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
grandmother
s
innocence
although
some
suspicion
attached
to
the
mother
s
influence
but
as
to
the
girl
herself
nothing
could
be
more
hardened
than
her
conduct
through
the
whole
transaction
she
stood
by
the
bed
to
see
her
master
drink
the
poison
witnessed
his
agonies
without
one
expression
of
surprise
or
pity
and
when
she
was
ordered
to
leave
the
room
she
pretended
to
be
fast
asleep
and
not
to
hear
what
was
said
to
her
even
since
her
imprisonment
she
could
never
be
prevailed
upon
to
say
that
she
was
sorry
for
her
master
s
having
been
poisoned
and
she
told
the
people
in
the
gaol
that
they
could
do
nothing
to
her
for
she
had
turned
king
s
evidence
against
her
she
was
condemned
to
die
on
thursday
next
the
day
after
she
heard
the
sentence
pronounced
without
the
least
emotion
and
i
am
told
that
when
she
went
down
the
steps
of
the
courthouse
she
was
seen
to
laugh
the
trial
appeared
to
be
conducted
with
all
possible
justice
and
propriety
the
jury
consisted
of
nine
respectable
persons
the
bench
of
three
magistrates
and
a
senior
one
to
preside
there
were
no
lawyers
employed
on
either
side
consequently
no
appeals
to
the
passions
no
false
lights
thrown
out
no
traps
no
flaws
no
quibbles
no
artful
and
no
of
witnesses
and
i
can
not
say
that
the
trial
appeared
to
me
to
go
on
at
all
the
worse
nobody
appeared
to
be
either
for
or
against
the
prisoner
the
only
object
of
all
present
was
evidently
to
come
at
the
truth
and
i
sincerely
believe
that
they
obtained
their
object
the
only
part
of
the
trial
of
which
i
disapproved
was
the
ordering
the
culprit
to
such
immediate
execution
that
sufficient
time
was
not
allowed
for
the
exercise
of
the
royal
prerogative
should
the
governor
have
been
disposed
to
commute
the
punishment
for
that
of
transportation
february
during
my
excursion
to
spanish
town
the
complaining
negroes
of
friendship
who
had
applied
to
me
for
relief
were
summoned
to
savannah
la
mar
before
the
council
of
protection
and
the
business
thoroughly
investigated
their
examination
has
been
sent
to
me
and
they
appear
to
have
had
a
very
fair
hearing
the
journals
of
the
estate
were
produced
the
examined
upon
oath
and
in
order
to
make
out
a
case
at
all
the
chief
complainant
contradicted
himself
so
grossly
as
left
no
doubt
that
the
whole
was
a
fabrication
they
were
therefore
dismissed
without
relief
but
also
without
punishment
in
spite
of
their
gross
falsehoods
and
calumnies
and
although
they
did
not
gain
their
object
i
make
no
doubt
that
they
will
go
on
more
contentedly
for
having
had
attention
paid
to
their
complaints
it
was
indeed
evident
that
nelly
the
chief
complainant
was
actuated
more
by
wounded
pride
than
any
real
feeling
of
hardship
for
what
she
laid
the
most
stress
upon
was
the
overseer
s
turning
his
back
upon
her
when
she
stated
herself
to
be
injured
and
walking
away
without
giving
her
any
answer
there
are
so
many
pleasing
and
amusing
parts
of
the
character
of
negroes
that
it
seems
to
me
scarcely
possible
not
to
like
them
but
when
they
are
once
disposed
to
evil
they
seem
to
set
no
bounds
to
the
indulgence
of
their
bad
passions
a
poor
girl
came
into
the
hospital
who
had
had
some
trifling
dispute
with
two
of
her
companions
on
which
the
two
friends
seized
her
together
and
each
fixing
her
teeth
on
one
of
the
girl
s
hands
bit
her
so
severely
that
we
greatly
fear
her
losing
the
use
of
both
of
them
i
happened
also
to
ask
this
morning
to
whom
a
skull
had
belonged
which
i
had
observed
fixed
on
a
pole
by
the
roadside
when
returning
last
from
montego
bay
i
was
told
that
about
five
years
ago
a
dunbar
had
given
some
discontent
to
his
negroes
in
the
article
of
clothing
them
although
in
other
respects
he
was
by
no
means
a
severe
master
however
this
was
sufficient
to
induce
his
head
driver
who
had
been
brought
up
in
his
own
house
from
infancy
to
form
a
plot
among
his
slaves
to
assassinate
him
and
he
was
assisted
in
this
laudable
design
by
two
young
men
from
a
neighbouring
property
who
barely
knew
dunbar
by
sight
had
no
enmity
against
him
whatever
and
only
joined
in
the
conspiracy
in
compliment
to
their
worthy
friend
the
driver
during
several
months
a
variety
of
attempts
were
made
for
effecting
their
purpose
but
accident
defeated
them
till
at
length
they
were
made
certain
of
his
intention
to
dine
out
at
some
distance
and
of
his
being
absolutely
obliged
to
return
in
the
evening
an
ambuscade
was
therefore
laid
to
intercept
him
and
on
his
passing
a
clump
of
trees
the
assassins
sprang
upon
him
the
driver
knocked
him
from
his
horse
and
in
a
few
moments
their
clubs
despatched
him
no
one
suspected
the
driver
but
in
the
course
of
enquiry
his
house
as
well
as
the
other
was
searched
and
not
only
dunbar
s
watch
was
found
concealed
there
but
with
it
one
of
his
ears
which
the
villain
had
carried
away
from
a
negro
belief
that
as
long
as
the
murderer
possesses
one
of
the
ears
of
his
victim
he
will
never
be
haunted
by
his
spectre
the
two
of
dunbar
s
negroes
and
the
driver
were
tried
confessed
the
crime
and
were
all
executed
the
head
of
the
latter
being
fixed
upon
a
pole
but
while
the
offenders
were
still
in
prison
the
overseer
upon
a
neighbouring
property
had
occasion
to
find
fault
in
the
field
with
a
woman
belonging
to
a
gang
hired
to
perform
some
particular
work
upon
which
she
flew
upon
him
with
the
greatest
fury
grasped
him
by
the
throat
cried
to
her
fellows
come
here
come
here
let
us
dunbar
him
and
through
her
strength
and
the
suddenness
of
her
attack
had
nearly
accomplished
her
purpose
before
his
own
slaves
could
come
to
his
assistance
this
woman
was
also
executed
this
happened
about
five
years
ago
when
the
mountains
were
in
a
very
rebellious
state
every
thing
there
is
at
present
quiet
but
only
last
year
a
belonging
to
the
next
estate
to
me
was
found
with
his
skull
fractured
in
one
of
my
own
nor
have
any
enquiries
been
able
to
discover
the
murderer
february
during
many
years
the
moravians
have
been
established
upon
the
neighbouring
estate
of
mesopotamia
as
the
ecclesiastical
commissaries
had
said
so
much
to
me
respecting
the
great
appetite
of
the
negroes
for
religious
instruction
i
was
desirous
of
learning
what
progress
had
been
made
in
this
quarter
and
this
morning
i
went
over
to
see
one
of
the
teachers
he
told
me
that
he
and
his
wife
had
jointly
used
their
best
efforts
to
produce
a
sense
of
religion
in
the
minds
of
the
slaves
that
they
were
all
permitted
to
attend
his
morning
and
evening
lectures
if
they
chose
it
but
that
he
could
not
say
that
they
showed
any
great
avidity
on
the
subject
it
seems
that
there
are
at
least
three
hundred
negroes
on
the
estate
the
number
of
believers
has
rather
increased
than
diminished
to
be
sure
but
still
in
a
very
small
proportion
when
this
gentleman
arrived
there
were
not
more
than
forty
baptised
persons
he
has
been
here
upwards
of
five
years
and
still
the
number
of
persons
belonging
to
his
church
as
he
expressed
it
does
not
exceed
fifty
of
these
seldom
more
than
ten
or
a
dozen
attend
his
lectures
at
a
time
as
to
the
remaining
two
hundred
and
fifty
they
take
no
more
notice
of
his
lectures
or
his
exhortations
than
if
there
were
no
such
person
on
the
property
are
only
very
civil
to
him
when
they
see
him
and
go
on
in
their
own
old
way
without
suffering
him
to
interfere
in
any
shape
by
the
overseer
of
greenwich
s
express
desire
the
moravian
has
however
agreed
to
give
up
an
hour
every
day
for
the
religious
instruction
of
the
negro
children
on
that
property
and
i
should
certainly
request
him
to
extend
his
labours
to
cornwall
if
i
did
not
think
it
right
to
give
the
church
of
england
clergymen
full
room
for
a
trial
of
their
intended
periodical
visitations
which
would
not
be
the
case
if
the
negroes
were
to
be
interfered
with
by
the
professors
of
any
other
communion
otherwise
i
am
myself
ready
to
give
free
ingress
and
egress
upon
my
several
estates
to
the
teachers
of
any
christian
sect
whatever
the
methodists
always
excepted
and
miss
peg
who
faints
at
the
sound
of
an
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
hope
of
any
material
benefit
arising
from
these
religious
visitations
made
at
quarterly
intervals
it
seems
to
me
as
nugatory
as
if
a
man
were
to
sow
a
field
with
and
expect
a
crop
of
colts
february
this
morning
my
picture
was
drawn
by
a
genius
a
negro
apelles
belonging
to
pope
the
minister
and
the
picture
was
exactly
such
as
a
genius
might
be
expected
to
produce
it
was
a
straight
hard
outline
without
shade
or
perspective
the
hair
was
a
large
black
patch
and
the
face
covered
with
an
uniform
layer
of
with
a
red
spot
in
the
centre
of
each
cheek
as
to
likeness
there
was
not
even
an
attempt
to
take
any
but
still
such
as
they
were
there
were
eyes
nose
and
mouth
to
be
sure
a
long
red
nose
supplied
the
place
of
my
own
snub
an
enormous
pair
of
whiskers
stretched
themselves
to
the
very
corner
of
my
mouth
and
in
place
of
three
hairs
and
a
half
the
painter
in
the
superabundance
of
his
generosity
bestowed
upon
me
a
pair
of
more
bushy
than
johnson
s
and
which
being
formed
in
an
exact
semicircle
made
the
eyes
beneath
them
stare
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
astonishment
the
negroes
however
are
in
the
highest
admiration
of
the
painter
s
skill
and
consider
the
portrait
as
a
striking
resemblance
for
there
is
a
very
blue
coat
with
very
yellow
buttons
and
white
gaiters
and
and
an
so
big
and
so
blue
that
it
looks
as
if
i
had
hung
a
pewter
plate
about
my
neck
and
a
bunch
of
larger
than
those
with
which
pope
has
decorated
belinda
s
great
great
grandsire
john
fuller
to
whom
jointly
with
nicholas
the
charge
of
this
inestimable
treasure
is
to
be
entrusted
could
not
find
words
to
express
his
satisfaction
at
the
performance
dere
massa
coat
and
dere
him
chair
him
sit
in
and
dere
massa
seals
all
just
de
very
same
ting
just
all
as
one
and
oh
ki
dere
massa
in
the
midst
of
his
raptures
he
dropped
the
picture
and
fractured
the
his
despair
now
equalled
his
former
joy
oh
now
what
for
him
do
such
a
pity
just
to
break
it
after
it
was
all
done
so
well
all
so
pretty
however
we
stuck
the
broken
glass
together
with
wafers
and
he
carried
it
off
assuring
me
that
when
massa
gone
he
should
talk
to
it
every
morning
all
one
as
if
massa
still
indeed
this
talking
to
massa
is
a
favourite
amusement
among
the
negroes
and
extremely
inconvenient
they
come
to
me
perpetually
with
complaints
so
frivolous
and
requests
so
unreasonable
that
i
am
persuaded
they
invent
them
only
to
have
an
excuse
for
talk
to
massa
and
when
i
have
given
them
a
plump
refusal
they
go
away
perfectly
satisfied
and
tank
massa
for
dis
here
great
indulgence
of
there
is
an
eboe
carpenter
named
strap
who
was
lately
sick
and
in
great
danger
and
whom
i
nursed
with
particular
care
the
poor
fellow
thinks
that
he
never
can
express
his
gratitude
sufficiently
and
whenever
he
meets
me
in
the
public
road
or
in
the
streets
of
savannah
la
mar
he
rushes
towards
the
carriage
roars
out
to
the
postilion
to
stop
and
if
the
boy
does
not
obey
instantly
he
abuses
him
with
all
his
power
for
why
him
no
stop
when
him
want
talk
to
massa
but
look
strap
your
beast
is
getting
away
oh
damn
beast
but
you
should
go
to
your
mountain
or
you
will
get
no
oh
damn
vittle
and
damn
mountain
me
no
want
vittle
me
want
talk
wid
massa
and
then
all
that
he
has
got
to
say
is
oh
massa
massa
god
bless
you
massa
me
quite
glad
to
see
you
come
back
my
own
massa
and
then
he
bursts
into
a
roar
of
laughter
so
wild
and
so
loud
that
the
can
not
help
stopping
to
stare
and
laugh
too
february
on
the
sunday
after
my
first
arrival
the
whole
body
of
eboe
negroes
came
to
me
to
complain
of
the
attorney
and
more
particularly
of
one
of
the
i
listened
to
them
if
not
with
unwearied
patience
at
least
with
unsubdued
fortitude
for
above
an
hour
and
a
half
and
finding
some
grounds
for
their
complaint
against
the
latter
in
a
few
days
i
went
down
to
their
quarter
of
the
village
told
them
that
to
please
them
i
had
discharged
the
named
a
day
for
examining
their
other
grievances
and
listened
to
them
for
an
hour
more
when
the
day
of
trial
came
they
sent
me
word
that
they
were
perfectly
satisfied
and
had
no
complaint
to
make
i
was
therefore
much
surprised
to
receive
a
visit
from
edward
the
eboe
yesterday
evening
who
informed
me
that
during
my
absence
his
fellows
had
formed
a
plan
of
making
a
complaint
to
a
neighbouring
magistrate
and
that
not
only
against
the
attorney
but
against
myself
for
not
listening
to
them
when
they
were
injured
and
edward
claimed
great
merit
with
me
for
having
prevented
their
taking
this
step
and
convinced
them
that
while
i
was
on
the
estate
myself
there
could
be
no
occasion
for
applying
to
a
third
person
now
having
made
me
aware
of
my
great
obligations
to
him
here
edward
meant
the
matter
to
rest
but
being
a
good
deal
incensed
at
their
ingratitude
i
instantly
sent
for
the
eboes
and
enquired
into
the
matter
when
it
appeared
that
edward
who
is
a
clever
fellow
and
has
great
influence
over
the
rest
had
first
goaded
them
into
a
resolution
of
complaining
to
a
magistrate
had
then
stopped
them
from
putting
their
plan
into
execution
and
that
the
whole
was
a
plot
of
edward
s
in
order
to
make
a
merit
with
me
for
himself
at
the
expense
of
his
countrymen
however
as
they
confessed
their
having
had
the
intention
of
applying
to
hill
as
a
magistrate
i
insisted
upon
their
executing
their
intention
i
told
them
that
as
hill
was
the
person
whom
they
had
selected
for
their
protector
to
hill
they
should
go
that
they
should
either
make
their
complaint
to
him
against
me
or
confess
that
they
had
been
telling
lies
and
had
no
complaint
to
make
and
that
as
the
next
day
was
to
be
a
given
them
by
me
instead
of
passing
it
at
home
in
singing
and
dancing
they
should
pass
it
at
the
bay
in
stating
their
grievances
this
threw
them
into
terrible
confusion
they
cried
out
that
they
wanted
to
make
no
complaint
whatever
and
that
it
was
all
edward
s
fault
who
had
misled
them
three
of
them
one
after
the
other
gave
him
the
lie
to
his
face
and
each
and
all
edward
as
well
as
the
rest
declared
that
go
to
the
bay
they
absolutely
would
the
next
morning
they
were
all
at
the
door
waiting
for
my
coming
out
they
positively
refused
to
go
to
hill
and
begged
and
prayed
and
humbled
themselves
now
scraping
and
bowing
to
me
and
then
blackguarding
edward
with
all
their
might
and
main
and
when
i
ordered
the
driver
to
take
charge
of
them
and
carry
them
to
hill
some
of
them
fairly
took
to
their
heels
and
ran
away
however
the
rest
soon
brought
them
back
again
for
they
swore
that
if
one
went
all
should
go
and
away
they
were
marched
in
a
string
of
about
twenty
with
the
driver
at
their
head
when
they
got
to
the
bay
they
told
hill
that
as
to
their
massa
they
had
no
complaint
to
make
against
him
except
that
he
had
compelled
them
to
make
one
and
what
they
said
against
the
attorney
was
so
trifling
that
the
magistrate
bade
the
driver
take
them
all
back
again
upon
which
they
slunk
away
to
their
houses
while
the
creoles
cried
out
shame
shame
as
they
passed
along
indeed
the
creoles
could
not
have
received
a
greater
pleasure
than
the
mortification
of
the
eboes
for
the
two
bodies
hate
each
other
as
cordially
as
the
guelphs
and
ghibellines
and
after
their
departure
for
the
bay
i
heard
the
head
cook
haranguing
a
large
audience
and
declaring
it
to
be
her
fixed
opinion
that
massa
ought
to
sell
all
the
eboes
and
buy
creoles
probably
cook
was
not
the
less
loud
in
her
exclamations
against
the
ingratitude
of
the
eboes
from
her
own
loyalty
having
lately
been
questioned
she
had
found
fault
one
day
in
the
hospital
with
some
women
who
feigned
sickness
in
order
to
remain
idle
you
no
work
willing
for
massa
said
cook
and
him
so
vex
him
say
him
go
to
kingston
and
him
wish
him
neber
come
back
again
what
cried
philippa
the
mad
woman
you
wish
massa
neber
come
back
from
kingston
so
she
gave
cook
a
box
on
the
ear
with
all
her
might
upon
which
cook
snatched
up
a
stick
and
broke
the
mad
woman
s
pate
with
it
but
though
she
could
beat
a
hole
in
her
head
she
never
could
beat
out
of
it
her
having
said
that
she
wished
massa
might
never
come
back
and
although
philippa
has
recovered
her
senses
in
her
belief
of
cook
s
disloyalty
she
continues
firm
and
they
never
meet
without
renewing
the
dispute
being
a
the
gaiety
of
the
negroes
was
promoted
by
a
distribution
of
an
additional
quantity
of
which
forms
a
most
acceptable
ingredient
in
their
and
as
much
rum
and
sugar
as
they
chose
to
drink
but
there
was
also
a
dinner
prepared
at
the
house
where
the
white
people
reside
expressly
for
none
but
the
that
is
for
the
women
who
had
children
living
i
had
taken
care
when
this
was
announced
by
the
head
driver
to
make
him
inform
the
negroes
that
they
were
indebted
for
it
entirely
to
these
mothers
and
to
show
them
the
more
respect
i
went
to
them
after
dinner
myself
and
drank
their
healths
the
most
respectable
blacks
on
the
estate
were
also
assembled
in
the
room
and
i
then
told
them
that
clothes
would
wear
out
and
money
would
be
spent
and
that
i
wished
to
give
them
something
more
lasting
than
clothes
or
money
the
law
only
allows
them
as
a
matter
of
right
every
alternate
saturday
for
themselves
and
holidays
for
three
days
at
christmas
which
with
all
sundays
forms
their
whole
legal
time
of
relaxation
i
therefore
granted
them
as
a
matter
of
right
and
of
which
no
person
should
deprive
them
on
any
account
whatever
saturday
to
cultivate
their
grounds
and
in
addition
to
their
holidays
at
christmas
i
gave
them
for
the
second
friday
in
october
and
the
second
friday
in
july
by
which
means
they
will
in
future
have
the
same
number
of
holidays
four
times
a
year
which
hitherto
they
have
been
allowed
only
once
at
christmas
the
first
is
to
be
called
the
royal
in
honour
of
that
excellent
princess
the
duchess
of
york
and
the
negroes
are
directed
to
give
three
cheers
upon
the
head
driver
s
announcing
the
health
of
our
good
lady
the
duchess
of
and
i
told
them
that
before
my
leaving
the
island
i
should
hear
them
drink
this
health
and
should
not
fail
to
let
her
royal
highness
know
that
the
negroes
of
cornwall
drank
her
health
every
year
this
evidently
touched
the
right
chord
of
their
vanity
and
they
all
bowed
and
courtesied
down
to
the
very
ground
and
said
that
would
do
them
much
high
honour
the
ninth
being
my
own
birthday
the
july
is
to
be
called
the
massa
s
and
that
in
october
is
to
be
in
honour
of
the
from
whom
it
is
to
take
its
name
the
poor
creatures
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
the
prospective
indulgences
which
had
just
been
announced
gave
them
such
an
increase
of
spirits
that
on
returning
to
my
own
residence
they
fell
to
singing
and
dancing
again
with
as
much
violence
as
if
they
had
been
a
pack
of
french
furies
at
the
opera
the
favourite
song
of
the
night
was
since
massa
come
we
very
well
off
which
words
they
repeated
in
chorus
without
intermission
dancing
all
the
time
for
hours
together
till
at
three
neither
my
eyes
nor
my
brain
could
endure
it
any
longer
and
i
was
obliged
to
send
them
word
that
i
wanted
to
go
to
bed
and
could
not
sleep
till
the
noise
should
cease
the
idea
of
my
going
to
bed
seemed
never
to
have
occurred
to
them
till
that
moment
fortunately
like
johnson
s
definition
of
wit
the
idea
although
novel
was
immediately
acknowledged
to
be
so
instantly
the
drums
and
gumbies
left
off
beating
the
children
left
off
singing
the
women
and
men
left
off
dancing
and
they
all
with
one
accord
fell
to
kicking
and
pulling
and
thumping
about
two
dozen
of
their
companions
who
were
lying
fast
asleep
upon
the
floor
some
were
roused
some
resisted
some
began
fighting
some
got
up
and
lay
down
again
but
at
length
by
dint
of
their
leading
some
carrying
others
and
rolling
the
remainder
down
the
steps
i
got
my
house
clear
of
my
black
guests
about
four
in
the
morning
another
of
their
popular
songs
this
evening
was
all
the
stories
them
telling
you
are
lies
oh
which
was
meant
as
a
satire
upon
the
eboes
my
friend
strap
being
an
eboe
and
one
who
had
hitherto
generally
taken
a
leading
part
in
all
the
discontents
and
squabbles
of
his
countrymen
i
was
not
without
apprehensions
of
his
having
been
concerned
in
the
late
complaint
i
was
therefore
much
pleased
to
find
that
he
had
positively
refused
to
take
any
share
in
the
business
and
had
been
to
the
full
as
violent
as
any
of
the
creoles
in
reprobating
the
ingratitude
of
the
eboes
today
he
came
up
to
the
house
dressed
in
his
best
clothes
to
show
me
his
seven
children
and
he
marched
at
their
head
in
all
the
dignity
of
paternal
pride
he
begged
me
particularly
to
notice
two
fine
little
girls
who
were
twins
i
told
him
that
i
had
seen
them
already
iss
iss
he
said
massa
see
um
but
massa
no
um
enough
upon
which
i
fell
to
admiring
them
tooth
and
nail
and
the
father
went
away
quite
proud
and
satisfied
february
yesterday
it
was
observed
at
george
s
plain
an
estate
about
four
miles
off
that
the
did
not
work
properly
and
it
was
concluded
that
the
grating
was
clogged
up
with
rubbish
to
clear
it
away
a
negro
immediately
jumped
down
into
the
trench
upon
a
log
of
wood
when
he
felt
the
log
move
under
him
and
of
course
jumped
out
again
with
all
possible
expedition
it
was
then
discovered
that
the
impediment
in
question
proceeded
from
a
large
alligator
which
had
wandered
from
the
morass
and
in
the
hope
of
finding
his
way
to
the
river
had
swam
up
the
till
he
found
himself
stopped
by
the
grating
and
the
banks
being
too
high
for
him
to
gain
them
by
leaping
upwards
and
the
place
of
his
confinement
too
narrow
to
admit
of
his
turning
round
to
go
back
again
his
escape
was
impossible
and
a
ball
lodged
near
his
eye
soon
put
an
end
to
him
i
went
over
to
see
him
this
morning
but
i
was
not
contented
with
merely
seeing
him
so
i
begged
to
have
a
steak
cut
off
for
me
brought
it
home
and
ordered
it
to
be
broiled
for
dinner
one
of
the
negroes
happened
to
see
it
in
the
kitchen
the
news
spread
through
the
estate
like
wildfire
and
i
had
immediately
half
a
dozen
different
deputations
all
hoping
that
massa
would
not
think
of
eating
the
alligator
for
it
was
poisonous
however
i
was
obstinate
and
found
the
taste
of
the
flesh
when
broiled
with
pepper
and
salt
and
assisted
by
an
onion
sauce
by
no
means
to
be
despised
but
the
consistence
of
the
meat
was
disagreeable
being
as
tough
as
a
piece
of
perhaps
any
body
who
wishes
to
eat
alligator
steaks
in
perfection
ought
to
keep
them
for
two
or
three
days
before
dressing
them
or
the
animal
s
age
might
be
in
fault
for
the
fellow
was
so
old
that
he
had
scarcely
a
tooth
in
his
head
i
therefore
contented
myself
with
two
or
three
morsels
but
a
person
who
was
dining
with
me
ate
a
whole
steak
and
pronounced
the
dish
to
be
a
very
good
one
the
eggs
are
said
to
be
very
palatable
nor
have
the
negroes
who
live
near
morasses
the
same
objection
with
those
of
cornwall
to
eating
the
flesh
it
is
however
true
that
the
gall
of
the
alligator
if
not
extracted
carefully
will
render
the
whole
animal
unfit
for
food
and
when
this
gall
is
reduced
to
powder
it
forms
a
poison
of
the
most
dangerous
nature
as
the
negroes
know
but
too
well
february
i
had
given
the
most
positive
orders
that
no
person
whatever
should
presume
to
strike
a
negro
or
give
him
abusive
language
or
however
great
the
offence
might
be
should
inflict
any
punishment
except
by
the
sole
direction
of
the
trustee
himself
yet
although
i
had
already
discharged
one
bookkeeper
on
this
account
this
evening
another
of
them
had
a
dispute
in
the
with
an
african
named
frank
because
a
pool
of
water
was
not
removed
fast
enough
upon
which
he
called
him
a
rascal
sluiced
him
with
the
dirty
water
and
finally
knocked
him
down
with
the
broom
the
african
came
to
me
instantly
four
who
were
examined
separately
proved
the
truth
of
his
and
i
immediately
discharged
the
who
had
contented
himself
with
simply
denying
the
blow
having
been
given
by
him
but
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
possibly
allow
his
single
unsupported
denial
to
outweigh
five
concordant
witnesses
to
the
assertion
and
that
if
he
grounded
his
claim
to
being
believed
merely
upon
his
having
a
white
skin
he
would
find
that
on
cornwall
estate
at
least
that
claim
would
not
be
admitted
the
fact
was
established
as
evident
as
the
sun
and
nothing
should
induce
me
to
retain
him
on
my
property
except
his
finding
some
means
of
appeasing
the
injured
negro
and
prevailing
on
him
to
intercede
in
his
behalf
this
was
an
humiliation
to
which
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
stoop
and
accordingly
the
man
has
left
the
estate
probably
indeed
the
attempt
at
reconciliation
would
have
been
unsuccessful
for
when
one
of
his
companions
asked
frank
whether
if
barker
would
make
him
a
present
he
had
not
better
take
it
and
beg
massa
to
let
him
stay
he
exclaimed
in
the
true
spirit
of
a
zanga
no
no
no
me
no
want
present
me
no
want
noting
me
no
beg
for
barker
him
go
away
i
was
kept
awake
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
by
the
songs
and
rejoicings
of
the
negroes
at
their
triumph
over
the
offending
february
the
only
horned
cattle
said
to
be
fit
for
jamaica
work
are
those
which
have
a
great
deal
of
black
in
them
the
white
are
terribly
tormented
by
the
insects
and
they
are
weak
and
sluggish
in
proportion
to
their
quantity
of
white
on
the
contrary
i
am
told
that
such
a
thing
as
a
black
horse
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
island
those
which
may
be
imported
black
soon
change
their
colour
into
a
bay
and
colts
are
said
to
have
been
dropped
perfectly
black
which
afterwards
grew
lighter
and
lighter
till
they
arrived
at
being
perfectly
white
february
hearing
that
a
manati
the
had
been
taken
at
the
mouth
of
the
cabrita
river
and
was
kept
alive
at
the
hope
wharf
i
got
a
and
went
about
eight
miles
to
see
the
animal
it
was
suffered
to
live
in
the
sea
a
rope
being
fastened
round
it
by
which
it
could
be
landed
at
pleasure
it
was
a
male
and
a
very
young
one
not
exceeding
nine
feet
in
length
whereas
they
have
frequently
been
found
on
the
outside
of
eighteen
the
females
yield
a
quart
of
milk
at
a
time
a
gentleman
told
me
that
he
had
tasted
it
and
could
not
have
distinguished
it
from
the
sweetest
cow
s
milk
unlike
the
seal
it
never
comes
on
shore
although
it
ventures
up
rivers
in
the
night
to
feed
on
the
grass
of
their
banks
but
during
the
day
it
constantly
inhabits
the
ocean
where
its
chief
enemy
is
the
shark
whose
attacks
it
beats
off
with
its
tail
the
strength
of
which
is
prodigious
it
was
killed
this
morning
and
the
gentleman
to
whom
it
belonged
was
obliging
enough
to
send
me
part
of
it
we
roasted
it
for
dinner
and
except
that
its
consistence
was
rather
firmer
i
should
not
have
known
it
from
veal
february
the
wife
of
an
old
negro
on
the
neighbouring
estate
of
anchovy
had
lately
forsaken
him
for
a
younger
lover
one
night
when
she
happened
to
be
alone
the
incensed
husband
entered
her
hut
unexpectedly
abused
her
with
all
the
rage
of
jealousy
and
demanded
the
clothes
to
be
restored
which
he
had
formerly
given
her
on
her
refusal
he
drew
a
knife
and
threatened
to
cut
them
off
her
back
nor
could
she
persuade
him
to
depart
till
she
had
received
a
severe
beating
he
had
but
just
left
the
hut
when
he
encountered
his
successful
rival
who
was
returning
home
a
quarrel
instantly
ensued
and
the
husband
having
the
knife
still
unsheathed
in
his
hand
plunged
it
into
the
neck
of
his
antagonist
it
pierced
the
jugular
vein
of
course
the
man
fell
dead
on
the
spot
and
the
murderer
has
been
sent
to
montego
bay
to
take
his
trial
march
friday
one
of
my
named
prince
is
son
to
the
duke
of
sully
and
his
grace
came
to
beg
that
when
i
should
leave
jamaica
i
would
direct
the
boy
to
be
made
a
tradesman
instead
of
being
sent
back
to
be
a
common
but
my
own
shops
are
not
only
full
at
present
but
loaded
with
future
engagements
sully
then
requested
that
i
would
send
his
son
to
learn
some
other
trade
a
tailor
s
for
instance
at
savannah
la
mar
as
had
been
frequently
done
in
former
times
but
this
also
i
was
obliged
to
refuse
i
told
him
that
formerly
a
master
could
pay
for
the
apprenticeship
of
a
clever
negro
boy
and
instead
of
employing
him
afterwards
on
the
estate
could
content
himself
with
being
repaid
by
a
share
of
the
profits
but
that
since
the
abolition
had
made
it
impossible
for
the
proprietor
of
an
estate
to
supply
the
place
of
one
negro
by
the
purchase
of
another
it
would
be
unjust
to
his
companions
to
suffer
any
one
in
particular
to
be
withdrawn
from
service
as
in
that
case
two
hundred
and
would
have
to
do
the
work
which
was
now
performed
by
three
hundred
and
therefore
i
could
allow
my
negroes
to
apply
themselves
to
no
trades
but
such
as
related
to
the
business
of
the
property
such
as
carpenters
coopers
smiths
all
true
massa
said
sully
all
fair
and
just
and
to
be
sure
a
tailor
or
a
saddler
would
be
of
no
great
use
towards
your
planting
and
getting
in
your
crop
nor
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
added
with
a
look
of
doubt
and
in
a
lower
voice
nor
nor
a
fiddler
either
i
suppose
massa
i
began
to
laugh
no
indeed
sully
nor
a
fiddler
either
it
seems
the
lad
who
is
about
sixteen
very
thoughtless
and
stupid
has
a
passion
for
playing
the
fiddle
and
among
other
trades
had
suggested
this
to
his
father
as
one
which
would
be
extremely
to
his
taste
we
finally
settled
that
when
the
plough
should
be
introduced
on
my
estate
which
i
am
very
anxious
to
accomplish
and
substitute
the
labour
of
oxen
for
that
of
negroes
wherever
it
can
possibly
be
done
prince
should
be
instructed
in
farming
business
and
in
the
mean
while
should
officiate
as
a
to
look
after
the
cattle
just
now
prince
came
to
me
with
a
request
of
his
own
massa
please
me
want
one
little
a
little
coat
for
what
massa
please
for
wear
when
me
go
down
to
the
and
why
should
you
wear
a
little
coat
when
you
go
to
the
bay
massa
please
make
me
look
eerie
buckish
when
me
go
so
i
assured
him
that
he
looked
quite
eerie
enough
already
and
that
as
i
was
going
away
too
soon
to
admit
of
my
seeing
him
in
his
little
coat
there
could
not
be
the
slightest
occasion
for
his
being
a
bit
than
he
was
a
master
in
england
would
probably
have
been
not
a
little
astonished
at
receiving
such
a
request
from
one
of
his
but
here
one
gets
quite
accustomed
to
them
and
when
they
are
refused
the
petitioners
frequently
laugh
themselves
at
their
own
unreasonableness
march
most
of
those
negroes
who
are
tolerably
industrious
breed
cattle
on
my
estate
which
are
their
own
peculiar
property
and
by
the
sale
of
which
they
obtain
considerable
sums
the
pasturage
of
a
steer
would
amount
in
this
country
to
a
year
but
the
negro
cattle
get
their
grass
from
me
without
its
costing
them
a
farthing
and
as
they
were
very
desirous
that
i
should
be
their
general
purchaser
i
ordered
them
to
agree
among
themselves
as
to
what
the
price
should
be
it
was
therefore
settled
that
i
should
take
their
whole
stock
good
and
bad
indifferently
at
the
rate
of
a
head
for
every
beast
and
they
expressed
themselves
not
only
satisfied
but
very
grateful
for
my
acceptance
of
their
proposal
john
fuller
and
the
beautiful
psyche
had
each
a
steer
to
sell
how
psyche
came
to
be
so
rich
i
had
too
much
discretion
to
enquire
and
they
were
paid
down
their
a
piece
instantly
which
they
carried
off
with
much
glee
march
sunday
in
this
country
it
may
be
truly
said
that
it
never
rains
but
it
after
a
drought
of
three
months
it
began
to
rain
on
thursday
morning
and
has
never
stopped
raining
since
with
thunder
all
the
day
and
lightning
all
the
night
one
consequence
of
which
incessant
showers
is
that
it
has
brought
out
all
sorts
of
insects
and
reptiles
in
crowds
the
ground
is
covered
with
lizards
the
air
is
filled
with
mosquitoes
and
their
bite
is
infinitely
more
envenomed
than
on
my
first
arrival
a
centipede
was
found
squeezed
to
death
under
the
door
of
my
this
morning
as
to
the
they
are
absolutely
in
legions
every
evening
my
negro
boys
are
set
to
hunt
them
and
they
kill
them
by
dozens
on
the
chairs
and
sofas
in
the
covers
of
my
books
and
among
the
leaves
in
my
yesterday
i
wanted
to
send
away
a
note
in
a
great
hurry
snatched
up
a
wafer
and
was
on
the
point
of
putting
it
into
my
mouth
when
i
felt
it
move
and
found
it
to
be
a
cockroach
which
had
worked
its
way
into
the
march
monday
since
my
arrival
in
jamaica
i
am
not
conscious
of
having
omitted
any
means
of
satisfying
my
negroes
and
rendering
them
happy
and
secure
from
oppression
i
have
suffered
no
person
to
be
punished
except
the
two
female
demons
who
almost
bit
a
girl
s
hands
off
for
which
they
received
a
slight
switching
and
the
most
worthless
rascal
on
the
estate
whom
for
manifold
offences
i
was
compelled
for
the
sake
of
discipline
to
allow
to
pass
two
days
in
the
bilboes
i
have
never
refused
a
favour
that
i
could
possibly
grant
i
have
listened
patiently
to
all
complaints
i
have
increased
the
number
of
negro
holidays
and
have
given
away
money
and
presents
of
all
kinds
incessantly
now
for
my
reward
on
saturday
morning
there
were
no
fewer
than
persons
not
including
children
in
the
hospital
which
makes
nearly
a
fifth
of
my
whole
gang
of
these
the
medical
people
assured
me
that
not
above
seven
had
any
thing
whatever
the
matter
with
them
the
rest
were
only
feigning
sickness
out
of
mere
idleness
and
in
order
to
sit
doing
nothing
while
their
companions
were
forced
to
perform
their
part
of
the
and
sure
enough
on
sunday
morning
they
all
walked
away
from
the
hospital
to
amuse
themselves
except
about
seven
or
eight
they
will
perhaps
go
to
the
field
for
a
couple
of
days
and
on
wednesday
we
may
expect
to
have
them
all
back
again
complaining
of
pains
which
not
existing
it
is
not
possible
to
remove
jenny
the
girl
whose
hands
were
bitten
was
told
by
the
doctoress
that
having
been
in
the
hospital
all
the
week
she
ought
not
for
very
shame
to
go
out
on
sunday
she
answered
she
wanted
to
go
to
the
mountains
and
go
she
then
said
the
doctoress
you
must
not
come
back
again
on
monday
at
yes
jenny
said
she
come
back
and
back
this
morning
jenny
came
but
as
her
wounds
were
almost
completely
well
she
had
tied
packthread
round
them
so
as
to
cut
deep
into
the
flesh
had
rubbed
dirt
into
them
and
in
short
had
played
such
tricks
as
nearly
to
produce
a
mortification
in
one
of
her
fingers
the
most
worthless
fellow
on
the
whole
property
is
one
nato
a
thief
a
liar
a
runaway
and
one
who
has
never
been
two
days
together
out
of
the
hospital
since
my
arrival
although
he
has
nothing
the
matter
with
him
indeed
when
the
other
negroes
abused
him
for
his
laziness
and
leaving
them
to
do
his
work
for
him
he
told
them
plainly
that
he
did
not
mean
to
work
and
that
nobody
should
make
him
the
only
real
illness
which
brought
him
to
the
hospital
within
my
knowledge
was
the
consequence
of
a
beating
received
from
his
own
father
who
had
caught
him
in
the
act
of
robbing
his
house
by
the
help
of
a
false
key
in
the
hospital
he
found
his
wife
philippa
the
mad
woman
with
whom
he
instantly
quarrelled
and
she
cut
his
head
open
with
a
plate
and
as
she
might
have
served
one
of
the
children
in
the
same
way
we
were
obliged
to
confine
her
her
husband
was
thought
to
be
the
fittest
person
to
guard
her
and
accordingly
they
were
locked
up
together
in
a
separate
room
from
the
other
invalids
till
a
straight
waistcoat
could
be
made
the
husband
was
then
restored
to
freedom
and
desired
to
go
to
work
which
he
declared
to
be
impossible
from
illness
yet
he
disappeared
the
whole
of
the
next
day
and
on
his
return
on
the
following
morning
he
had
the
impudence
to
assert
that
he
had
never
been
out
of
the
hospital
for
an
hour
for
this
runaway
offence
and
for
endeavouring
to
exasperate
his
wife
s
phrensy
he
was
put
into
the
bilboes
for
two
days
on
the
third
he
was
released
when
he
came
to
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
implored
me
most
earnestly
to
forgive
what
had
past
and
promised
to
behave
better
for
the
future
to
so
good
a
it
appeared
afterwards
that
he
had
employed
his
absence
in
complaining
to
williams
a
neighbouring
magistrate
that
having
a
spite
against
them
although
neither
he
nor
his
wife
had
committed
any
fault
i
had
punished
them
both
by
locking
them
up
for
several
days
in
a
solitary
prison
under
pretence
of
his
wife
s
insanity
when
in
fact
she
was
perfectly
in
her
unluckily
one
of
my
physicians
had
told
williams
that
very
morning
how
much
he
had
been
alarmed
at
cornwall
when
upon
going
into
a
mad
woman
s
room
her
husband
had
fastened
the
door
and
he
had
found
himself
shut
up
between
them
the
woman
really
mad
and
the
man
pretending
to
be
so
too
the
moment
that
nato
mentioned
the
mad
woman
as
his
wife
what
then
said
williams
you
are
the
fellow
who
alarmed
the
doctor
so
much
two
days
ago
upon
which
nato
had
the
impudence
to
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
oh
ki
massa
doctor
no
need
be
fright
we
no
want
to
hurt
him
only
make
lilly
bit
fun
wid
him
massa
that
on
which
he
was
ordered
to
get
out
of
williams
s
house
slunk
back
into
the
cornwall
hospital
and
in
a
few
days
came
to
me
with
such
a
long
story
of
penitence
and
so
good
massa
that
he
induced
me
to
forgive
him
to
sum
up
the
whole
about
three
this
morning
an
alarm
was
given
that
the
had
suffered
the
cattle
to
get
among
the
canes
where
they
might
do
infinite
mischief
the
trustee
was
roused
out
of
his
bed
the
drivers
blew
their
shells
to
summon
the
negroes
to
their
assistance
when
it
appeared
that
there
was
not
a
single
watchman
at
his
post
the
had
all
been
suffered
to
expire
not
a
single
domestic
was
to
be
found
nor
a
horse
to
be
procured
even
the
little
servant
boys
whom
the
trustee
had
locked
up
in
his
own
house
and
had
left
fast
asleep
when
he
went
to
bed
had
got
up
again
and
made
their
escape
to
pass
the
night
in
play
and
rioting
and
although
they
were
perfectly
aware
of
the
detriment
which
the
cattle
were
doing
to
my
interests
not
a
negro
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
rouse
himself
and
help
to
drive
them
out
till
at
length
cubina
who
had
run
down
from
his
own
house
to
mine
on
the
first
alarm
with
difficulty
collected
about
half
a
dozen
to
assist
him
but
long
before
this
one
of
my
best
was
trampled
to
pieces
and
the
produce
of
this
year
s
crop
considerably
and
so
much
for
negro
gratitude
however
they
still
continue
their
eternal
song
of
now
massa
come
we
very
well
off
but
their
satisfaction
evidently
begins
and
ends
with
themselves
they
rejoice
sincerely
at
being
very
well
off
but
think
it
unnecessary
to
make
the
slightest
return
to
massa
for
making
them
so
march
the
worst
of
negro
diseases
is
the
it
is
both
hereditary
and
contagious
and
will
lurk
in
the
blood
of
persons
apparently
the
most
healthy
and
of
regular
habits
till
a
certain
age
when
it
declares
itself
in
the
form
of
offensive
sores
attended
with
extreme
debility
no
cure
for
it
has
yet
been
discovered
there
are
negro
doctors
who
understand
how
to
prepare
diet
drinks
from
simples
of
the
island
which
moderate
its
virulence
for
a
time
but
the
disease
itself
is
never
entirely
subdued
on
the
contrary
the
yaws
although
it
defies
the
power
of
medicine
ultimately
cures
itself
this
also
is
communicated
by
contact
and
that
of
so
slight
a
nature
that
a
fly
which
had
touched
an
ulcer
produced
by
the
yaws
has
been
known
to
convey
the
infection
by
merely
alighting
on
the
wound
of
a
cut
finger
it
generally
shows
itself
by
a
slight
pimple
which
is
soon
converted
into
a
sore
and
this
spreads
itself
gradually
over
the
invalid
s
whole
body
till
having
made
its
progress
through
the
system
completely
its
virulence
gradually
abates
and
at
length
the
disease
disappears
all
together
as
the
yaws
can
only
be
taken
once
inoculation
has
been
tried
upon
the
most
hopeful
subjects
but
the
disease
showed
itself
with
as
much
violence
as
when
contracted
in
the
natural
way
march
nato
has
kept
his
promise
as
yet
and
has
actually
past
a
whole
week
in
the
field
a
thing
which
he
was
never
known
to
do
before
within
the
memory
of
man
so
i
sent
him
a
piece
of
money
to
encourage
him
and
told
him
that
i
sent
him
a
for
behaving
well
and
wished
to
know
whether
any
one
had
ever
given
him
a
maccarony
for
behaving
ill
i
hear
that
he
was
highly
delighted
at
my
thinking
him
worthy
to
receive
a
present
from
me
and
sent
me
in
return
the
most
positive
assurances
of
perseverance
in
good
conduct
on
the
other
hand
mackaroo
has
not
only
run
away
himself
but
has
carried
his
wife
away
with
him
this
is
improving
upon
the
profligacy

british
manners

a
vengeance

england

runs
away

own

ungrateful
demigod

brought
down
upon
himself

misdeeds

heavy
rains

negroes
found
him
in
the
mountains
unable
to
raise
himself
from
the
ground
and
brought
him
in
a
cart
to
the
hospital
where
he
now
lies
having
quite
lost
the
use
of
one
side
and
without
any
hopes
of
recovery

is
still
a
young

in
every

the
shaddock
contains
generally
seeds
two
of
which
only
will
reproduce
shaddocks
and
these
two
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
the
rest
will
yield
some
sweet
oranges
others
bitter
ones
others
again
forbidden
fruit
and
in
short
all
the
varieties
of
the
orange
but
until
the
trees
actually
are
in
bearing
no
one
can
guess
what
the
fruit
is
likely
to
prove
and
even
then
the
seeds
which
produce
shaddocks
although
taken
from
a
tree
remarkable
for
the
excellence
of
its
fruit
will
frequently
yield
only
such
as
are
scarcely
eatable
so
also
the
varieties
of
the
mango
are
infinite
the
fruit
of
no
two
trees
resembling
each
other
and
the
seeds
of
the
very
finest
mango
although
sown
and
cultivated
with
the
utmost
care
seldom
affording
any
thing
at
all
like
the
parent
stock
the
two
first
mangoes
which
i
tasted
were
nothing
but
turpentine
and
sugar
the
third
was
very
delicious
and
yet
i
was
told
that
it
was
by
no
means
of
a
superior
quality
the
cassava
requires
no
preparation
the
cassava
unless
the
juice
is
carefully
pressed
out
of
it
is
a
deadly
poison
there
is
a
third
kind
called
the
cassava
which
is
perfectly
wholesome
till
a
certain
age
when
it
acquires
its
deleterious
qualities
many
persons
have
been
poisoned
by
mistaking
these
various
kinds
of
cassava
for
each
other
as
soon
as
the
plantain
has
done
bearing
it
is
cut
down
when
four
or
five
suckers
spring
from
each
root
which
become
plants
themselves
in
their
turn
ratoons
are
suckers
of
the
they
are
far
preferable
to
the
original
plants
where
the
soil
is
rich
enough
to
support
them
but
they
are
much
better
adapted
to
some
estates
than
to
others
thus
on
my
estate
in
thomas
s
in
the
east
they
can
allow
of
ten
ratoons
from
the
same
plant
and
only
dig
every
eleventh
year
while
at
cornwall
the
strength
of
the
cane
is
exhausted
in
the
fourth
ratoon
or
the
fifth
at
furthest
the
fresh
plants
are
but
those
canes
which
bear
or
feathers
at
their
extremities
will
not
answer
the
purpose
as
dry
weather
easily
burns
up
the
slight
arrows
to
which
the
flags
adhere
and
destroys
them
before
they
can
acquire
sufficient
vigour
to
resist
the
climate
march
sunday
i
find
that
i
have
not
done
justice
to
the
cotton
tree
and
on
the
other
hand
have
given
too
much
praise
to
the
jamaica
kitchen
the
first
cotton
trees
which
i
saw
were
either
withered
by
age
or
struck
by
lightning
or
happened
to
be
of
their
kind
but
i
have
since
met
with
others
than
which
nothing
could
be
more
noble
or
picturesque
from
their
gigantic
height
the
immense
spread
of
their
arms
the
colour
of
their
stems
and
leaves
and
the
wild
fantastic
wreathings
of
their
roots
and
branches
as
to
the
kitchen
nothing
can
be
larger
and
finer
in
appearance
than
the
poultry
of
all
kinds
but
nothing
can
be
uniformly
more
tough
and
tasteless
and
the
same
is
the
case
with
all
butcher
s
meat
pork
excepted
which
is
much
better
here
than
in
europe
the
fault
is
in
the
climate
which
prevents
any
animal
food
from
being
kept
sufficiently
long
to
become
tender
so
that
when
a
man
sits
down
to
a
jamaica
dinner
he
might
almost
fancy
himself
a
guest
at
macbeth
s
banquet
where
the
fowls
hams
and
legs
of
mutton
are
all
made
of
deal
boards
i
ordered
a
duck
to
be
kept
for
two
days
but
it
was
so
completely
spoiled
that
there
was
no
bearing
it
upon
the
table
then
i
tried
the
expedient
of
boiling
a
fowl
till
it
absolutely
fell
to
pieces
but
even
this
violent
process
had
not
the
power
of
rendering
it
tender
the
only
effect
produced
by
it
was
that
instead
of
being
helped
to
a
wing
of
solid
wood
i
got
a
plateful
of
splinters
perhaps
my
having
totally
lost
my
appetite
probably
from
my
not
being
able
to
take
in
this
climate
sufficient
of
my
usual
exercise
makes
the
meat
appear
to
me
less
palatable
than
it
may
to
others
but
i
have
observed
that
most
people
here
prefer
living
upon
soups
stews
and
salted
provisions
for
my
own
part
i
have
for
the
last
few
weeks
eaten
nothing
except
black
crabs
than
which
i
never
met
with
a
more
delicious
article
for
the
table
i
have
also
tried
the
soup
which
is
in
great
estimation
in
this
island
but
although
it
greatly
resembled
the
very
richest
soup
it
seemed
to
be
composed
of
which
had
been
kept
too
long
the
themselves
were
perfectly
fresh
for
they
were
brought
to
the
kitchen
quite
alive
and
merry
but
i
was
told
that
this
taste
of
staleness
is
their
peculiar
flavour
as
well
as
their
peculiar
scent
even
when
alive
and
is
precisely
the
quality
which
forms
their
recommendation
it
was
quite
enough
to
fix
my
opinion
of
the
soup
i
ate
two
spoonfuls
and
never
mean
to
venture
on
a
third
march
the
most
general
of
negro
infirmities
appears
to
be
that
of
lameness
it
is
chiefly
occasioned
by
the
a
diminutive
fly
which
works
itself
into
the
feet
to
lay
its
eggs
and
if
it
be
not
carefully
extracted
in
time
the
flesh
around
it
corrupts
and
a
sore
ensues
not
easily
to
be
cured
no
vigilance
can
prevent
the
attacks
of
the
chiga
and
not
only
soldiers
but
the
very
cleanest
persons
of
the
highest
rank
in
society
are
obliged
to
have
their
feet
examined
regularly
the
negroes
are
all
provided
with
small
knives
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
them
but
as
no
pain
is
felt
till
the
sore
is
produced
their
extreme
laziness
frequently
makes
them
neglect
that
precaution
till
all
kinds
of
dirt
getting
into
the
wound
increases
the
difficulty
of
a
cure
and
sometimes
the
consequence
is
lameness
for
life
there
is
another
disease
which
commits
great
ravages
among
them
for
although
in
this
climate
its
quality
is
far
from
virulent
and
it
is
easy
to
be
cured
in
its
beginning
the
negro
will
most
carefully
conceal
his
having
such
a
complaint
till
it
has
made
so
great
a
progress
that
its
effects
are
perceived
by
others
even
then
they
will
never
acknowledge
the
way
in
which
they
have
contracted
it
but
men
and
women
whose
noses
almost
shake
while
speaking
to
you
will
still
insist
upon
it
that
their
illness
arises
from
catching
cold
or
from
a
strain
in
lifting
a
weight
or
in
short
from
any
cause
except
the
true
one
yet
why
they
act
thus
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
for
certainly
it
does
not
arise
from
shame
indeed
it
is
one
of
their
singular
obstinacies
that
however
ill
they
may
be
they
scarcely
ever
will
confess
to
the
physician
what
is
really
the
matter
with
them
on
their
first
coming
into
the
hospital
but
will
rather
assign
some
other
cause
for
their
being
unwell
than
the
true
one
and
it
is
only
by
that
their
superintendents
are
able
to
understand
the
true
nature
of
their
case
perhaps
this
duplicity
is
occasioned
by
fear
for
in
any
bodily
pain
it
is
not
possible
to
be
more
cowardly
than
the
negro
and
i
have
heard
strong
young
men
while
the
tears
were
running
down
their
cheeks
scream
and
roar
as
if
a
limb
was
amputating
although
the
doctoress
was
only
applying
a
poultice
to
a
whitlow
on
the
finger
i
suppose
therefore
that
dread
of
the
pain
of
some
unknown
mode
of
treatment
makes
them
conceal
their
real
disease
and
name
some
other
of
which
they
know
the
cure
to
be
unattended
with
bodily
suffering
or
long
restraint
in
the
disease
i
allude
to
such
a
motive
would
operate
with
peculiar
force
as
one
of
their
chief
aversions
is
the
necessarily
being
long
confined
to
one
certainly
not
fragrant
room
march
the
reporter
of
the
african
institution
asserts
in
a
late
pamphlet
that
in
the
west
indies
the
breeding
system
is
to
this
day
discouraged
and
that
the
planters
are
still
indifferent
to
the
preservation
of
their
present
stock
of
negroes
from
their
confidence
of
getting
fresh
supplies
from
africa
certainly
the
negroes
in
jamaica
are
by
no
means
of
this
reporter
s
opinion
but
are
thoroughly
sensible
of
their
intrinsic
value
in
the
eyes
of
the
proprietor
on
my
arrival
every
woman
who
had
a
child
held
it
up
to
show
to
me
exclaiming
see
massa
see
here
nice
new
neger
me
bring
for
work
for
massa
and
those
who
had
more
than
one
did
not
fail
to
boast
of
the
number
and
make
it
a
claim
to
the
greater
merit
with
me
last
week
an
old
watchman
was
brought
home
from
the
mountains
almost
dead
with
fever
he
would
neither
move
nor
speak
nor
notice
any
one
for
several
days
for
two
nights
i
sent
him
soup
from
my
own
table
but
he
could
not
even
taste
it
and
always
gave
it
to
his
daughter
on
the
third
evening
there
happened
to
be
no
soup
at
dinner
and
i
sent
other
food
instead
but
old
cudjoe
had
been
accustomed
to
see
the
soup
arrive
and
the
disappointment
made
him
fancy
himself
hungry
and
that
he
could
have
eaten
the
soup
if
it
had
been
brought
as
usual
accordingly
when
i
visited
him
the
next
morning
he
bade
the
doctoress
tell
me
that
massa
had
send
him
no
soup
the
night
before
this
was
the
first
notice
that
he
had
ever
taken
of
me
i
promised
that
some
soup
should
be
ordered
for
him
on
purpose
that
evening
could
he
fancy
any
thing
to
eat
milk
milk
so
milk
was
sent
to
him
and
he
drank
two
full
calabashes
of
it
i
then
tried
him
with
an
egg
which
he
also
got
down
and
at
night
by
spoonfuls
at
a
time
he
finished
the
whole
bason
of
soup
but
when
i
next
came
to
see
him
and
he
wished
to
thank
me
the
words
in
which
he
thought
he
could
comprise
most
gratitude
were
bidding
the
doctoress
tell
me
he
would
do
his
best
not
to
die
yet
he
promised
to
for
it
he
is
now
quite
out
of
danger
and
seems
really
to
be
grateful
when
he
was
sometimes
too
weak
to
speak
on
my
leaving
the
room
he
would
drag
his
hand
to
his
mouth
with
difficulty
and
kiss
it
three
or
four
times
to
bid
me
farewell
and
once
when
the
doctoress
mentioned
his
having
charged
her
to
tell
me
that
he
owed
his
recovery
to
the
good
food
that
i
had
sent
him
he
added
and
him
kind
words
too
massa
kind
words
do
neger
much
good
much
as
good
in
my
visits
to
the
old
man
i
observed
a
young
woman
nursing
him
with
an
infant
in
her
arms
which
as
they
told
me
was
her
own
by
cudjoe
i
therefore
supposed
her
to
be
his
wife
but
i
found
that
she
belonged
to
a
man
in
the
mountains
and
that
cudjoe
hired
her
from
her
master
at
the
rate
of
thirty
pounds
a
year
i
hope
this
fact
will
convince
the
african
that
it
is
possible
for
some
of
this
oppressed
race
of
human
beings
of
these
our
most
unfortunate
to
enjoy
at
least
of
the
luxuries
of
civilised
society
and
i
doubt
whether
even
wilberforce
himself
with
all
his
benevolence
would
not
allow
a
negro
to
be
quite
rich
enough
who
can
afford
to
pay
thirty
pounds
a
year
for
the
hire
of
a
kept
mistress
march
poor
nato
s
stock
of
goodness
is
quite
exhausted
and
the
day
before
yesterday
he
returned
to
the
hospital
with
most
piteous
complaints
of
pains
and
aches
whose
existence
he
could
persuade
no
person
to
credit
his
pulse
was
regular
his
skin
cool
his
tongue
red
and
moist
and
the
doctor
declared
nothing
whatever
to
be
the
matter
with
him
however
on
my
arrival
he
began
to
moan
and
groan
and
grunt
and
all
so
lamentably
that
every
soul
in
the
hospital
sick
or
well
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
for
my
part
i
told
him
that
i
really
believed
him
to
be
very
bad
and
that
as
he
met
with
no
sympathy
in
the
hospital
i
should
remove
him
from
such
unfeeling
companions
accordingly
i
had
a
comfortable
bed
made
for
him
in
a
separate
house
here
he
was
plentifully
supplied
with
provisions
but
in
order
that
he
might
enjoy
perfect
repose
daring
his
illness
the
doors
were
kept
locked
and
no
person
allowed
to
disturb
him
with
their
conversation
while
by
the
doctor
s
orders
he
was
obliged
to
take
frequent
doses
of
and
assafotida
shame
would
not
suffer
him
to
get
well
all
at
once
so
yesterday
he
still
complained
of
a
pain
in
his
chest
and
begged
to
be
blooded
his
request
was
granted
and
the
blood
proved
to
be
so
pure
and
that
every
one
exclaimed
that
for
a
man
who
had
such
good
blood
to
part
with
it
so
wantonly
was
a
shame
and
a
folly
the
fellow
was
at
length
convinced
that
his
tricks
would
serve
no
object
and
this
morning
he
begged
me
to
suffer
him
to
return
to
his
duty
and
promised
that
i
should
have
no
more
cause
to
complain
of
him
so
i
consented
to
consider
his
cure
as
completed
and
he
set
off
for
the
field
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
release
march
on
opening
the
for
the
county
of
cornwall
on
march
stewart
the
custos
of
trelawny
and
presiding
judge
said
in
his
charge
to
the
jury
he
wished
to
direct
their
attention
in
a
peculiar
manner
to
the
infringement
of
in
the
island
in
consequence
of
charges
having
been
brought
forward
in
england
of
slave
laws
not
being
enforced
in
this
country
and
being
in
fact
perfect
dead
letters
the
charge
was
unfounded
but
it
became
proper
in
consequence
for
the
bench
to
call
in
a
strong
manner
on
the
grand
jury
to
be
particularly
vigilant
and
attentive
to
the
discharge
of
this
part
of
their
duty
the
bench
at
the
same
time
adverted
to
another
subject
connected
with
the
above
many
out
of
the
country
and
in
had
thought
proper
to
interfere
with
our
system
and
by
their
insidious
practices
and
dangerous
doctrines
to
call
the
peace
of
the
island
into
question
and
to
promote
disorder
and
confusion
the
jury
were
therefore
enjoined
in
every
such
case
to
investigate
it
thoroughly
and
to
bring
the
parties
concerned
before
the
country
and
not
to
suffer
the
systems
of
the
island
as
established
by
the
laws
of
the
land
to
be
overset
or
endangered
it
was
their
bounden
duty
to
watch
over
and
support
the
established
laws
and
to
act
against
those
who
dared
to
infringe
them
and
that
otherwise
it
was
imperiously
called
for
on
the
principle
of
every
country
had
its
peculiar
laws
on
the
due
maintenance
of
which
depended
the
public
safety
and
welfare
i
read
all
this
with
the
most
perfect
unconsciousness
when
lo
and
behold
i
have
been
assured
from
a
variety
of
quarters
that
all
this
was
levelled
at
myself
it
is
i
it
seems
who
am
calling
the
peace
of
the
island
in
question
who
am
promoting
disorder
and
confusion
and
who
am
infringing
the
established
laws
i
should
never
have
guessed
it
by
insidious
practices
is
meant
as
i
am
told
my
overindulgence
to
my
negroes
and
my
endeavouring
to
obtain
either
redress
or
pardon
for
those
belonging
to
other
estates
who
occasionally
appeal
to
me
for
protection
while
dangerous
doctrines
alludes
to
my
being
of
opinion
that
the
evidence
of
negroes
ought
at
least
to
be
against
white
persons
the
jury
always
making
proportionable
abatements
of
belief
from
bearing
in
mind
the
bad
habits
of
most
negroes
their
general
want
of
probity
and
good
faith
in
every
respect
and
their
total
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
religious
obligations
at
the
same
time
these
defects
may
be
counterbalanced
by
the
respectable
character
of
the
particular
negro
by
the
strength
of
corroborating
circumstances
and
finally
by
the
irresistible
conviction
which
his
evidence
may
leave
upon
the
minds
of
the
jury
they
are
not
obliged
to
a
negro
witness
but
i
maintain
that
he
ought
to
be
and
then
let
the
jury
give
their
verdict
according
to
their
conscience
but
this
in
the
opinion
of
the
bench
at
montego
bay
it
seems
is
dangerous
doctrine
at
least
the
venom
of
my
doctrines
is
circumscribed
within
very
narrow
limits
for
as
i
have
made
a
point
of
never
stirring
off
my
own
estate
nobody
could
possibly
be
corrupted
by
them
except
those
who
were
at
the
trouble
of
walking
into
my
house
for
the
express
purpose
of
being
corrupted
at
all
events
if
i
am
the
person
to
whom
stewart
alluded
i
must
consider
his
speech
as
the
most
flattering
compliment
that
i
ever
received
if
my
presence
in
the
island
has
made
the
bench
of
a
whole
country
think
it
necessary
to
exact
from
the
jury
a
more
severe
vigilance
than
usual
in
all
causes
relating
to
the
protection
of
negroes
i
can
not
but
own
myself
most
richly
rewarded
for
all
my
pains
and
expense
in
coming
hither
for
every
risk
of
the
voyage
and
for
every
possible
sacrifice
of
my
pleasures
there
is
nothing
earthly
that
is
too
much
to
give
for
the
power
of
producing
an
effect
so
beneficial
and
i
would
set
off
for
constantinople
could
i
only
be
convinced
that
my
arrival
would
make
the
mufti
redress
the
complaints
of
the
lower
orders
of
turks
with
more
scrupulous
justice
and
the
bashaws
relax
the
fetters
of
their
slaves
as
much
as
their
safety
would
permit
but
i
can
not
flatter
myself
with
having
done
either
the
one
or
the
other
in
jamaica
and
if
stewart
alluded
to
me
in
his
charge
i
am
certainly
greatly
obliged
to
him
but
he
has
paid
me
much
too
high
a
compliment
god
grant
that
i
may
live
to
deserve
it
march
hercules
the
poor
paralytic
runaway
has
neither
moved
nor
spoken
since
his
being
brought
into
the
hospital
for
the
two
last
days
he
refused
all
sustenance
blisters
rubbing
with
mustard
were
tried
without
producing
the
least
sensation
and
in
the
course
of
last
night
he
expired
without
a
groan
another
offender
by
name
charles
fox
is
also
under
the
doctor
s
hands
suffering
under
the
effects
of
his
own
transgressions
having
been
pickle
s
shipmate
he
professed
the
strongest
attachment
to
him
and
was
perpetually
at
his
house
till
pickle
s
wife
made
her
husband
aware
that
love
for
herself
was
the
real
object
of
his
shipmate
s
visits
finding
her
story
disbelieved
she
hid
pickle
behind
the
bed
when
he
had
an
opportunity
of
hearing
the
solicitations
of
his
perfidious
pylades
and
rushing
from
his
concealment
he
gave
fox
so
complete
a
thrashing
that
he
was
obliged
to
come
to
the
hospital
here
is
another
proof
that
negroes
our
unfortunate
are
not
without
some
of
the
luxuries
of
civilised
life
old
men
of
sixty
keeping
mistresses
and
young
ones
seducing
their
friends
wives
why
what
would
the
reporter
of
the
african
institution
have
it
is
only
to
be
wished
that
the
negroes
would
content
themselves
with
these
fashionable
peccadilloes
but
unluckily
there
are
some
palates
among
them
which
require
higher
seasoned
vices
and
besides
their
occasional
amusements
of
poisoning
stabbing
thieving
a
plan
has
just
been
discovered
in
the
adjoining
parish
of
elizabeth
s
for
giving
themselves
a
grand
fête
by
murdering
all
the
whites
in
the
island
the
focus
of
this
meditated
insurrection
was
on
martin
s
penn
the
property
of
lord
balcarras
where
the
overseer
is
an
old
man
of
the
mildest
character
and
the
negroes
had
always
been
treated
with
peculiar
indulgence
above
a
thousand
persons
were
engaged
in
the
plot
three
hundred
of
whom
had
been
regularly
sworn
to
assist
in
it
with
all
the
usual
accompanying
ceremonies
of
drinking
human
blood
eating
earth
from
graves
luckily
the
plot
was
discovered
time
enough
to
prevent
any
mischief
and
yesterday
the
ringleaders
were
to
be
tried
at
black
river
march
sunday
the
cornwall
chronicle
informs
us
that
at
the
montego
bay
assizes
a
man
was
tried
on
the
monday
for
assaulting
while
drunk
an
officer
who
had
served
with
great
distinction
and
calling
him
a
coward
for
which
offence
he
was
sentenced
to
a
month
s
imprisonment
and
fine
of
and
on
the
tuesday
the
same
man
brought
an
action
against
another
person
for
calling
him
a
drunken
liar
for
which
he
was
awarded
for
damages
a
plain
man
would
have
supposed
two
such
verdicts
to
be
rather
incompatible
but
one
lives
to
learn
i
remember
to
have
read
the
case
of
a
french
nobleman
who
was
accused
of
impotence
by
his
wife
before
the
parliament
of
paris
and
by
a
farmer
s
daughter
for
seduction
and
getting
her
with
child
before
the
parliament
of
rouen
he
thought
himself
perfectly
sure
of
gaining
either
the
one
cause
or
the
other
but
however
he
was
condemned
in
both
certainly
the
poor
frenchman
had
no
luck
in
matters
of
justice
to
make
the
matter
better
in
the
present
instance
the
man
was
a
clergyman
and
his
cause
of
quarrel
against
the
officer
was
the
latter
s
refusal
to
give
him
a
puncheon
of
rum
to
christen
all
his
negroes
in
a
lump
march
plummer
came
over
from
james
s
and
told
me
that
the
insidious
practices
and
dangerous
doctrines
in
stewart
s
speech
were
intended
for
the
methodists
and
that
only
the
charge
to
the
grand
jury
respecting
additional
vigilance
was
in
allusion
to
myself
but
he
added
that
it
was
the
report
at
montego
bay
that
in
consequence
of
my
to
my
negroes
a
song
had
been
made
at
cornwall
declaring
that
i
was
come
over
to
set
them
all
free
and
that
this
was
now
circulating
through
the
neighbouring
parishes
if
there
be
any
such
song
which
i
do
not
believe
i
certainly
never
heard
it
however
my
agent
here
says
that
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
my
negroes
really
have
spread
the
report
that
i
intend
to
set
free
in
a
few
years
and
this
merely
out
of
vanity
in
order
to
give
themselves
and
their
master
the
greater
credit
upon
other
estates
as
to
the
truth
of
an
assertion
that
is
a
point
which
never
enters
into
negro
consideration
the
two
ringleaders
of
the
proposed
rebellion
have
been
condemned
at
black
river
the
one
to
be
hanged
the
other
to
transportation
the
plot
was
discovered
by
the
overseer
of
lyndhurst
penn
a
frenchman
from
domingo
observing
an
uncommon
concourse
of
stranger
negroes
to
a
child
s
funeral
on
which
occasion
a
hog
was
roasted
by
the
father
he
stole
softly
down
to
the
feasting
hut
and
listened
behind
a
hedge
to
the
conversation
of
the
supposed
mourners
when
he
heard
the
whole
conspiracy
detailed
it
appears
that
above
two
hundred
and
fifty
had
been
sworn
in
regularly
all
of
them
africans
not
a
creole
was
among
them
but
there
was
a
ascertained
to
have
stolen
over
into
the
island
from
domingo
and
a
anabaptist
missionary
both
of
whom
had
been
very
active
in
promoting
the
plot
they
had
elected
a
king
of
the
eboes
who
had
two
captains
under
him
and
their
intention
was
to
effect
a
complete
massacre
of
all
the
whites
on
the
island
for
which
laudable
design
his
majesty
thought
christmas
the
very
fittest
season
in
the
year
but
his
captains
were
more
impatient
and
were
for
striking
the
blow
immediately
the
next
morning
information
was
given
against
them
one
of
the
captains
escaped
to
the
woods
but
the
other
and
the
king
of
the
eboes
were
seized
and
brought
to
justice
on
their
trial
they
were
perfectly
cool
and
unconcerned
and
did
not
even
profess
to
deny
the
facts
with
which
they
were
charged
indeed
proofs
were
too
strong
to
admit
of
denial
among
others
a
copy
of
the
following
song
was
found
upon
the
king
which
the
overseer
had
heard
him
sing
at
the
funeral
feast
while
the
other
negroes
joined
in
the
chorus
song
of
the
king
of
the
eboes
oh
me
good
friend
wilberforce
make
we
free
god
almighty
thank
ye
god
almighty
thank
ye
god
almighty
make
we
free
buckra
in
this
country
no
make
we
free
what
negro
for
to
do
what
negro
for
to
do
take
force
by
force
take
force
by
force
chorus
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
the
eboe
king
said
that
he
certainly
had
made
use
of
this
song
and
what
harm
was
there
in
his
doing
so
he
had
sung
no
songs
but
such
as
his
brown
priest
had
assured
him
were
approved
of
by
john
the
baptist
and
who
then
was
john
the
baptist
he
did
not
very
well
know
only
he
had
been
told
by
his
brown
priest
that
john
the
baptist
was
a
friend
to
the
negroes
and
had
got
his
head
in
a
pan
as
to
the
captain
he
only
said
in
his
defence
that
if
the
court
would
forgive
him
this
once
he
would
not
do
so
again
as
he
found
the
whites
did
not
like
their
plans
which
it
seems
till
that
moment
they
had
never
suspected
they
had
all
along
imagined
no
doubt
that
the
whites
would
find
as
much
amusement
in
having
their
throats
cut
as
the
blacks
would
find
in
cutting
them
i
remember
hearing
a
sportsman
who
was
defending
the
humanity
of
hunting
maintain
that
it
being
as
much
the
nature
of
a
hare
to
run
away
as
of
a
dog
to
run
after
her
consequently
the
hare
must
receive
as
much
pleasure
from
being
coursed
as
the
dog
from
coursing
march
two
negroes
upon
amity
estate
quarrelled
the
other
day
about
some
trifle
when
the
one
bit
the
other
s
nose
off
completely
soon
after
his
accident
the
overseer
meeting
the
sufferer
why
sambo
he
exclaimed
where
s
your
nose
i
can
t
tell
massa
answered
sambo
i
looked
every
where
about
but
i
could
not
find
march
sunday
every
sunday
since
my
return
from
kingston
i
have
read
prayers
to
such
of
the
negroes
as
chose
to
attend
preparatory
to
the
intended
visitations
of
the
minister
pope
about
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
most
respectable
among
them
generally
attended
and
behaved
with
great
attention
and
propriety
i
read
the
litany
and
made
them
repeat
the
responses
i
explained
the
commandments
and
the
lord
s
prayer
to
them
teaching
them
to
say
each
sentence
of
the
latter
after
me
as
i
read
it
slowly
in
hopes
of
impressing
it
upon
their
memory
then
came
the
good
samaritan
or
some
such
apologue
and
lastly
i
related
to
them
a
portion
of
the
life
of
christ
and
explained
to
them
the
object
of
his
death
and
sufferings
the
latter
part
of
my
service
always
seemed
to
interest
them
greatly
but
indeed
they
behaved
throughout
with
much
attention
unluckily
the
head
driver
who
was
one
of
the
most
zealous
of
my
disciples
never
could
repeat
the
responses
of
the
litany
without
an
appeal
to
myself
and
always
made
a
point
of
saying
good
lord
deliver
us
yes
sir
and
made
me
a
low
bow
and
one
day
when
i
was
describing
the
wonderful
precocity
of
christ
s
understanding
as
evidenced
by
his
interview
with
the
doctors
in
the
temple
while
but
a
child
the
head
driver
thought
fit
to
interrupt
me
with
beg
massa
pardon
but
want
know
one
ting
as
puzzle
me
massa
say
the
child
and
me
want
know
massa
one
ting
much
was
jesus
christ
a
boy
or
a
girl
like
my
friend
the
moravian
at
mesopotamia
i
can
not
boast
of
any
increased
audience
and
if
the
negroes
will
not
come
to
hear
massa
i
have
little
hope
of
their
giving
up
their
time
to
hear
pope
who
inspires
them
with
no
interest
and
can
exert
no
authority
indeed
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
indebted
for
the
chief
part
of
my
present
auditory
to
my
quality
of
massa
rather
than
that
of
priest
and
when
i
ask
any
of
them
why
they
did
not
come
to
prayers
on
the
preceding
sunday
their
excuse
is
always
coupled
with
an
assurance
that
they
wished
very
much
to
come
because
they
wish
to
do
to
oblige
march
the
negroes
certainly
are
perverse
beings
they
had
been
praying
for
a
sight
of
their
master
year
after
year
they
were
in
raptures
at
my
arrival
i
have
suffered
no
one
to
be
punished
and
shown
them
every
possible
indulgence
during
my
residence
amongst
them
and
one
and
all
they
declare
themselves
perfectly
happy
and
well
treated
yet
previous
to
my
arrival
they
made
hogsheads
a
week
in
a
fortnight
after
my
landing
their
product
dwindled
to
daring
this
last
week
they
have
managed
to
make
but
thirteen
still
they
are
not
ungrateful
they
are
only
selfish
they
love
me
very
well
but
they
love
themselves
a
great
deal
better
and
to
do
them
justice
i
verily
believe
that
every
negro
on
the
estate
is
extremely
anxious
that
all
should
do
their
full
duty
except
himself
my
censure
although
accompanied
with
the
certainty
of
their
not
being
punished
is
by
no
means
a
matter
of
indifference
if
i
express
myself
to
be
displeased
the
whole
property
is
in
an
uproar
every
body
is
finding
fault
with
every
body
nobody
that
does
not
represent
the
shame
of
neglecting
my
work
and
the
ingratitude
of
vexing
me
by
their
and
then
each
individual
having
said
so
much
and
said
it
so
strongly
that
he
is
convinced
of
its
having
its
full
effect
in
making
the
others
do
their
duty
thinks
himself
quite
safe
and
snug
in
skulking
away
from
his
own
march
young
hill
was
told
at
the
bay
this
morning
that
i
make
a
part
of
the
eboe
king
s
song
according
to
this
report
good
king
george
and
good
wilberforce
are
stated
to
have
given
me
a
paper
to
set
the
negroes
free
an
order
but
that
the
white
people
of
jamaica
will
not
suffer
me
to
show
the
paper
and
i
am
now
going
home
to
say
so
and
to
resume
my
chair
which
i
have
left
during
my
absence
to
be
filled
by
the
since
i
heard
the
report
of
a
rebellious
song
issuing
from
cornwall
i
have
listened
more
attentively
to
the
negro
chaunts
but
they
seem
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
to
relate
entirely
to
their
own
private
situation
and
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
negro
state
in
general
their
favourite
we
varry
well
off
is
still
screamed
about
the
estate
by
the
children
but
among
the
grown
people
its
nose
has
been
put
out
of
joint
by
the
following
stanzas
which
were
explained
to
me
this
morning
for
several
days
past
they
had
been
dinned
into
my
ears
so
incessantly
that
at
length
i
became
quite
curious
to
know
their
import
which
i
learned
from
phillis
who
is
the
family
minstrel
it
will
be
evident
from
this
specimen
that
the
cornwall
bards
are
greatly
inferior
to
those
of
black
river
who
have
actually
advanced
so
far
as
to
make
an
attempt
at
rhyme
and
metre
negro
song
at
cornwall
me
no
care
a
dammee
a
damn
me
acquire
a
house
i
have
a
solid
foundation
to
build
on
since
massa
come
see
we
oh
neger
now
quite
eerie
hearty
for
once
me
see
massa
when
massa
go
me
no
care
a
dammee
for
how
them
usy
we
an
alligator
crossing
the
morass
at
bellisle
an
estate
but
a
few
miles
distant
from
cornwall
fell
into
a
from
which
he
struggled
in
vain
to
extricate
himself
and
was
taken
alive
so
that
according
to
the
vulgar
expression
he
may
literally
be
said
to
have
put
his
foot
in
fontenelle
says
that
when
copernicus
published
his
system
he
foresaw
the
contradictions
which
he
should
have
to
undergo
et
il
se
tira
d
affaire
le
jour
qu
on
lui
présentoit
le
premier
exemplaire
ce
qu
il
fit
il
mourut
which
was
precisely
the
resource
resorted
to
by
the
alligator
he
died
on
the
second
morning
of
his
captivity
and
his
proprietor
storer
was
obliging
enough
to
order
the
skin
to
be
stuffed
and
to
make
me
a
present
of
him
neptune
was
despatched
to
bring
him
or
rather
her
for
nineteen
eggs
were
found
within
her
over
to
cornwall
and
at
dinner
we
were
alarmed
with
a
general
hubbub
it
proved
to
be
occasioned
by
neptune
s
arrival
if
thames
or
achelous
had
been
despatched
on
this
errand
it
would
have
been
more
appropriate
with
the
alligator
on
his
head
in
a
few
minutes
every
thing
on
the
estate
that
was
alive
without
feathers
and
with
only
two
legs
flocked
into
the
room
and
requested
to
take
a
bird
view
of
the
monster
for
as
to
coming
near
her
they
were
much
too
cowardly
to
venture
it
was
in
vain
that
i
represented
to
them
that
being
dead
it
was
utterly
impossible
that
the
animal
could
hurt
them
they
allowed
the
impossibility
but
still
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
and
when
at
length
i
succeeded
in
persuading
them
to
approach
it
upon
some
one
accidentally
moving
the
alligator
s
tail
they
all
with
one
accord
set
up
a
loud
scream
and
men
women
and
children
tumbled
out
of
the
room
over
one
another
to
the
irreparable
ruin
of
some
of
my
glasses
and
decanters
and
the
extreme
trepidation
of
the
whole
the
who
stabbed
his
rival
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
has
been
tried
at
montego
bay
and
acquitted
on
the
other
hand
the
king
of
the
eboes
has
been
hung
at
black
hiver
and
died
declaring
that
he
left
enough
of
his
countrymen
to
prosecute
the
design
in
hand
and
revenge
his
death
upon
the
whites
such
threats
of
a
rescue
were
held
out
that
it
was
judged
advisable
to
put
the
militia
under
arms
till
the
execution
should
have
taken
place
and
also
to
remove
the
king
s
captain
to
the
gaol
at
savannah
la
mar
till
means
can
be
found
for
transporting
him
from
the
island
march
the
eboe
captain
has
effected
his
escape
by
burning
down
the
prison
door
it
is
supposed
that
he
has
fled
towards
the
fastnesses
in
the
interior
of
the
mountains
where
i
am
assured
that
many
settlements
of
slaves
have
been
formed
and
with
which
the
inhabited
part
of
the
island
has
no
communication
however
the
chief
of
the
accompong
maroons
captain
roe
is
gone
in
pursuit
of
him
and
has
promised
to
bring
him
in
alive
or
dead
the
latter
is
the
only
reasonable
expectation
as
the
fugitive
is
represented
as
a
complete
desperado
the
negroes
have
at
least
given
me
one
proof
of
their
not
being
entirely
selfish
when
they
heard
that
the
boat
was
come
to
convey
my
baggage
to
the
ship
at
black
river
they
collected
all
their
poultry
and
brought
it
to
my
agent
desiring
him
to
add
it
to
my
of
course
i
refused
to
let
them
be
received
and
they
were
evidently
much
disappointed
till
i
consented
to
accept
the
fowls
and
ducks
and
then
gave
them
back
to
them
again
telling
them
to
consider
them
as
a
present
from
my
own
and
to
distinguish
them
by
the
name
of
massa
s
march
i
have
been
positively
assured
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
persuade
the
grand
jury
at
montego
bay
to
present
me
for
to
my
own
negroes
it
is
a
great
pity
that
so
reasonable
an
attempt
should
not
have
the
rebel
captain
who
broke
out
of
prison
has
been
found
concealed
in
the
hut
of
a
notorious
and
has
been
lodged
a
second
time
in
the
gaol
of
savannah
la
mar
march
about
two
months
ago
a
runaway
cooper
belonging
to
shrewsbury
estate
by
name
edward
applied
to
me
to
intercede
for
his
not
being
punished
on
his
return
home
as
soon
as
he
got
the
paper
requested
he
gave
up
all
idea
of
returning
to
the
estate
and
instead
of
it
went
about
the
country
stealing
every
thing
upon
which
he
could
lay
his
hands
and
whenever
his
proceedings
were
enquired
into
by
the
magistrates
he
stated
himself
to
be
on
the
road
to
his
trustee
and
produced
my
letter
as
a
proof
of
it
at
length
some
one
had
the
curiosity
to
open
the
letter
and
found
that
it
had
been
written
two
months
before
march
this
was
the
day
appointed
for
the
first
royal
when
i
bade
farewell
to
my
negroes
i
expected
to
be
besieged
with
petitions
and
complaints
as
they
must
either
make
them
on
this
occasion
or
not
at
all
i
was
therefore
most
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
although
they
had
opportunities
of
addressing
me
from
nine
in
the
morning
till
twelve
at
night
the
only
favours
asked
me
were
by
a
poor
old
man
who
wanted
an
iron
cooking
pot
and
by
adam
who
begged
me
to
order
a
little
daughter
of
his
to
be
instructed
in
and
as
to
complaints
not
a
murmur
of
such
a
thing
was
heard
they
all
expressed
themselves
to
be
quite
satisfied
and
seemed
to
think
that
they
could
never
say
enough
to
mark
their
gratitude
for
my
kindness
and
their
anxiety
for
my
getting
safe
to
england
we
began
our
festival
by
the
head
driver
s
drinking
the
health
of
the
duchess
of
york
whom
the
negroes
cheered
with
such
a
shout
as
might
have
rent
hell
s
then
we
had
a
christening
of
such
persons
as
had
been
absent
on
the
former
occasion
one
of
whom
was
adam
the
reputed
in
the
number
was
a
child
whom
we
called
shakspeare
and
whom
afra
the
eboe
mother
had
very
earnestly
begged
me
to
make
a
christian
as
well
as
a
daughter
of
hers
about
four
or
five
years
old
at
the
same
time
that
she
declined
being
christened
herself
in
the
same
manner
cubina
s
wife
although
her
father
and
husband
were
both
baptised
on
the
former
occasion
objected
to
going
through
the
ceremony
herself
and
the
reason
which
she
gave
was
that
she
did
not
like
being
christened
while
she
was
with
child
as
she
did
not
know
what
change
it
might
not
produce
upon
herself
and
the
after
the
christening
there
was
a
general
distribution
of
by
the
trustee
and
i
also
gave
every
man
and
woman
half
a
dollar
each
and
every
child
a
maccarony
fifteen
pence
as
a
parting
present
to
show
them
that
i
parted
with
them
in
while
the
money
was
distributing
young
hill
arrived
and
finding
the
house
completely
crowded
he
enquired
what
was
the
matter
oh
massa
said
an
old
woman
it
is
only
who
is
giving
the
negroes
all
i
also
read
to
them
a
new
code
of
laws
which
i
had
ordered
to
be
put
in
force
at
cornwall
for
the
better
security
of
the
negroes
the
principal
were
that
a
new
hospital
for
the
women
and
for
those
who
might
be
seriously
ill
should
be
built
and
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
while
the
present
one
should
be
reserved
for
those
whom
the
physicians
might
declare
to
be
very
slightly
indisposed
or
not
ill
at
all
the
doors
being
kept
constantly
locked
and
the
sexes
placed
in
separate
chambers
to
prevent
its
being
made
a
place
of
amusement
by
the
lazy
and
lying
as
is
the
case
at
a
book
register
of
punishments
to
be
kept
in
which
the
name
offence
and
nature
and
quantity
of
punishment
inflicted
must
be
carefully
put
down
and
also
a
note
of
the
same
given
to
the
negro
in
order
that
if
he
should
think
himself
unjustly
or
too
severely
punished
he
may
show
his
note
to
my
other
attorney
on
his
next
visit
or
to
myself
on
my
return
to
jamaica
and
thus
get
redress
if
he
has
been
no
negro
is
to
be
struck
or
punished
in
any
way
without
the
trustee
s
express
orders
the
black
driver
so
offending
to
be
immediately
degraded
and
sent
to
work
in
the
field
and
the
white
person
for
such
a
breach
of
my
orders
to
be
discharged
upon
the
no
negro
is
to
be
punished
till
hours
shall
have
elapsed
between
his
committing
the
fault
and
suffering
for
it
in
order
that
nothing
should
be
done
in
the
heat
of
passion
but
that
the
trustee
should
have
time
to
consider
the
matter
coolly
but
to
prevent
a
guilty
person
from
avoiding
punishment
by
running
away
he
is
to
pass
those
hours
in
such
confinement
as
the
trustee
may
think
most
any
white
person
who
can
be
proved
to
have
had
an
improper
connection
with
a
woman
known
publicly
to
be
living
as
the
wife
of
one
of
my
negroes
is
to
be
discharged
immediately
upon
complaint
being
i
also
gave
the
head
driver
a
complete
list
of
the
allowances
of
clothing
food
to
which
the
negroes
were
entitled
in
order
that
they
might
apply
to
it
if
they
should
have
any
doubts
as
to
their
having
received
their
full
proportion
and
my
new
rules
seemed
to
add
greatly
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
negroes
who
were
profuse
in
their
expressions
of
gratitude
the
festival
concluded
with
a
grander
ball
than
usual
as
i
sent
for
music
from
savanna
la
mar
to
play
country
dances
to
them
and
at
twelve
o
clock
at
night
they
left
me
apparently
much
pleased
only
i
heard
some
of
them
saying
to
each
other
when
shall
we
have
such
a
day
of
pleasure
again
since
massa
goes
march
sunday
with
their
usual
levity
the
negroes
were
laughing
and
talking
as
gaily
as
ever
till
the
very
moment
of
my
departure
but
when
they
saw
my
curricle
actually
at
the
door
to
convey
me
away
then
their
faces
grew
very
long
indeed
in
particular
the
women
called
me
by
every
endearing
name
they
could
think
of
my
son
my
love
my
husband
my
father
you
no
my
massa
you
my
tata
said
one
old
woman
upon
which
another
wishing
to
go
a
step
beyond
her
added
iss
massa
iss
it
was
you
and
when
i
came
down
the
steps
to
depart
they
crowded
about
me
kissing
my
feet
and
clasping
my
knees
so
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
get
into
the
carriage
and
this
was
done
with
such
marks
of
truth
and
feeling
that
i
can
not
believe
the
whole
to
be
mere
acting
and
mummery
i
dined
with
allwood
at
shaftstone
his
pen
near
and
at
half
past
seven
found
myself
once
more
on
board
the
sir
godfrey
webster
to
fill
up
my
list
of
jamaica
delicacies
i
must
not
forget
to
mention
that
i
did
my
best
to
procure
a
cat
roasted
in
the
true
african
fashion
the
creole
negroes
however
greatly
disapproved
of
my
venturing
upon
this
dish
which
they
positively
denied
having
tasted
themselves
and
when
at
length
the
cat
was
procured
last
saturday
instead
of
plainly
boiling
it
with
and
salt
they
made
into
a
high
seasoned
stew
which
rendered
it
impossible
to
judge
of
its
real
flavour
however
i
tasted
it
as
did
also
several
other
people
and
we
were
unanimous
in
opinion
that
it
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
very
good
and
that
when
properly
dressed
a
cat
must
be
excellent
food
one
of
the
best
vegetable
productions
of
the
island
is
esteemed
to
be
the
avogada
pear
sometimes
called
the
vegetable
it
was
not
the
proper
season
for
them
and
with
great
difficulty
i
procured
a
couple
which
were
said
to
be
by
no
means
in
a
state
of
perfection
such
as
they
were
i
could
find
no
great
merit
in
them
they
were
to
be
eaten
cold
with
pepper
and
salt
and
seemed
to
be
an
insipid
kind
of
melon
with
no
other
resemblance
to
marrow
than
their
softness
april
monday
at
eight
this
morning
we
weighed
anchor
on
our
return
to
england
yarra
poor
yarra
comes
to
bid
farewell
but
yarra
s
lips
can
never
say
it
her
swimming
eyes
her
bosom
s
swell
the
debt
she
owes
you
these
must
pay
it
she
ne
er
can
speak
though
tears
can
start
her
grief
that
fate
so
soon
removes
you
but
one
there
is
who
reads
the
heart
and
well
he
knows
how
yarra
loves
you
see
massa
see
this
sable
boy
when
chill
disease
had
nipp
d
his
flower
you
came
and
spoke
the
word
of
joy
and
poured
the
juice
of
healing
power
to
visit
far
jamaica
s
shore
had
no
kind
angel
deign
d
to
move
you
these
laughing
eyes
had
laugh
d
no
more
nor
yarra
lived
to
thank
and
love
you
then
grieve
not
massa
that
to
view
our
isle
you
left
your
british
pleasures
one
tear
which
falls
in
grateful
dew
is
worth
the
best
of
britain
s
treasures
and
sure
the
thought
will
bring
relief
what
e
er
your
fate
wherever
rove
you
your
wealth
s
not
given
by
pain
and
grief
but
hands
that
know
and
hearts
that
love
you
may
he
who
bade
you
cross
the
wave
through
care
for
afric
s
sons
and
daughters
when
round
your
bark
the
billows
rave
in
safety

you
through
the
waters

smiles

met
through
life
each
good

to

the
which
facilitate
the
passage
to
jamaica
effectually
prevent
the
return
of
vessels
by
the
same
road
the
common
passage
is
through
the
gulf
of
florida
but
there
is
another
between
cuba
and
domingo
which
is
at
least
miles
nearer
the
first
however
affords
almost
a
certainty
of
reaching
europe
in
a
given
time
while
you
may
keep
tacking
in
the
attempt
to
make
the
windward
passage
as
it
is
called
for
months
together
last
night
the
wind
was
so
favourable
for
this
attempt
that
the
captain
determined
upon
risking
it
accordingly
he
altered
his
course
and
had
not
done
so
for
more
than
a
few
hours
when
the
wind
changed
and
became
as
direct
for
the
gulf
as
till
then
it
had
been
contrary
the
consequence
was
that
the
gulf
passage
was
fixed
once
for
all
and
we
are
now
steering
towards
it
with
all
our
might
and
main
besides
the
distance
saved
there
was
another
reason
for
preferring
the
windward
passage
if
it
could
have
been
effected
the
gulf
of
florida
has
for
some
time
past
been
infested
by
a
pirate
called
captain
mitchell
who
by
all
accounts
seems
to
be
of
the
very
worst
description
it
is
not
long
ago
since
in
company
with
another
vessel
of
his
own
stamp
he
landed
on
the
small
settlement
of
andrews
plundered
it
completely
and
on
his
departure
carried
off
the
governor
whom
he
kept
on
board
for
more
than
fourteen
days
and
then
hung
him
at
the
out
of
mere
wanton
devilry
and
indeed
he
is
said
to
show
no
more
mercy
to
any
of
his
prisoners
than
he
did
to
the
poor
governor
his
companion
has
been
captured
and
brought
into
kingston
and
the
conquering
vessel
is
gone
in
search
of
captain
mitchell
if
it
does
not
fall
in
with
him
and
do
i
fear
that
we
shall
stand
but
a
bad
chance
for
he
has
one
hundred
men
on
board
according
to
report
while
we
have
not
above
thirty
however
the
captain
has
harangued
them
represented
the
necessity
of
their
fighting
if
attacked
as
captain
mitchell
is
known
to
spare
no
one
high
or
low
and
has
engaged
to
give
every
man
five
guineas
apiece
if
a
gun
should
be
fired
the
sailors
promise
bravery
whether
their
promises
will
prove
to
be
we
must
leave
to
be
decided
by
time
and
captain
mitchell
in
the
mean
while
every
sail
that
appears
on
the
horizon
is
concluded
to
be
this
terrible
pirate
and
every
thing
is
immediately
put
in
readiness
for
action
this
day
we
passed
the
caymana
islands
but
owing
to
our
having
always
either
a
contrary
wind
or
no
wind
at
all
it
was
not
till
the
that
cuba
was
visible
nor
till
the
that
we
reached
cape
florida
april
at
noon
this
day
we
found
ourselves
once
more
sailing
on
the
atlantic
and
bade
farewell
to
the
gulf
of
florida
without
having
heard
any
news
of
the
dreaded
commodore
mitchell
the
narrow
and
dangerous
part
of
this
gulf
is
about
two
hundred
miles
in
length
and
fifty
in
breadth
bordered
on
one
side
by
the
coast
of
florida
and
on
the
other
first
by
cuba
and
then
by
the
bahama
islands
of
which
the
manilla
reef
forms
the
extremity
and
which
reef
also
terminates
the
gulf
but
on
both
sides
of
these
two
hundred
miles
at
the
distance
of
about
four
or
five
miles
from
the
main
land
there
extends
a
reef
which
renders
the
navigation
extremely
dangerous
the
reef
is
broken
at
intervals
by
large
inlets
and
the
sudden
and
violent
squalls
of
wind
to
which
the
gulf
is
subject
so
frequently
drive
vessels
into
these
perilous
openings
that
it
is
worth
the
while
of
many
of
the
poorer
inhabitants
of
florida
to
establish
their
habitations
within
the
reef
and
devote
themselves
and
their
small
vessels
entirely
to
the
occupation
of
assisting
vessels
in
distress
they
are
known
by
the
general
name
of
wreckers
and
are
allowed
a
certain
salvage
upon
such
ships
as
they
may
rescue
as
a
proof
of
the
violence
of
the
gales
which
are
occasionally
experienced
in
this
gulf
our
captain
about
nine
years
ago
saw
the
wind
suddenly
take
a
vessel
which
had
unwisely
suffered
her
canvass
to
stand
while
the
rest
of
the
ships
under
convoy
had
taken
theirs
down
and
turn
her
completely
over
the
sails
in
the
water
and
the
keel
uppermost
it
happened
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
captain
and
the
passengers
were
at
dinner
in
the
cabin
but
as
she
went
over
very
leisurely
they
and
the
crew
had
time
allowed
them
to
escape
out
of
the
windows
and
and
sustain
themselves
upon
the
rigging
till
boats
from
the
ships
near
them
could
arrive
to
take
them
off
as
she
filled
she
gradually
sunk
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
had
disappeared
totally
april
the
flying
fish
bright
alike
who
sharing
both
elements
could
sport

in

our
captain
while
his
vessel
was
lying
in
black
river
bay
for
the
purpose
of
loading
was
informed
by
his
sailors
that
their
beef
and
other
provisions
frequently
disappeared
in
a
very
unaccountable
manner
however
by
setting
a
strict
watch
during
the
night
he
soon
managed
to
clear
up
the
mystery
and
a
negro
who
had
made
his
escape
from
the
workhouse
and
concealed
himself
on
board
among
the
bags
of
cotton
was
found
to
be
the
thief
he
was
sent
back
to
the
workhouse
of
which
the
chain
was
still
about
his
neck
but
another
negro
had
better
luck
in
a
similar
attempt
on
board
of
a
different
vessel
he
contrived
to
secrete
himself
in
the
lower
part
of
it
where
the
sugar
hogsheads
are
stored
unknown
to
any
one
as
soon
as
the
cargo
was
completed
the
planks
above
it
were
caulked
down
and
raised
no
more
till
their
ship
reached
liverpool
when
to
the
universal
astonishment
upon
opening
the
hold
out
walked
mungo
in
a
wretched
condition
to
be
sure
but
still
at
least
alive
and
a
freeman
in
great
britain
during
his
painful
voyage
he
had
subsisted
entirely
upon
sugar
of
which
he
had
consumed
nearly
an
hogshead
how
he
managed
for
water
i
could
not
learn
nor
can
imagine
april
the
old
steward
this
morning
told
one
of
the
sailors
who
complained
of
being
ill
that
he
would
get
well
as
soon
as
he
should
reach
england
and
could
have
plenty
of
vegetables
for
he
said
the
man
had
only
got
a
complaint
nothing
but
just
scurvy

many
years
ago
a
new
species
of
grass
was
imported
into
jamaica
by
vassal
to
whom
an
estate
near
my
own
then
belonged
as
he
said
for
the
purpose
of
feeding
his
pigs
and
his
its
seeds
being
soon
scattered
about
by
the
birds
it
has
taken
possession
of
the
whence
to
eradicate
it
is
an
utter
impossibility
the
roots
being
as
strong
as
those
of
ginger
and
insinuating
themselves
under
ground
to
a
great
extent
so
that
the
only
means
of
preventing
it
from
entirely
choking
up
the
canes
is
plucking
it
out
with
the
hand
which
is
obliged
to
be
done
frequently
and
has
increased
the
labour
of
the
plantation

nuisance

is
called

its
original
introducer

which
was
imported
for
the
purpose
of
eating
up
the
ants
of
the
country
and
so
to
be
sure
they
did
but
into
the
bargain
they
eat
up
every
thing
else
which
came
in
their
way
a
practice
in
which
they
persist
to
this
hour
so
that
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
jamaica
most
execrations
are
bestowed
in
the
course
of
the
day
upon
vassal
s
grass
the
sir
charles
price
s
rats
or
the
reporter
of

that
the
maledictions
uttered

april
tuesday
a
whole
calendar
month
has
elapsed
since
our
quitting
jamaica
during
which
the
wind
has
been
favourable
for
something
less
than
hours
either
it
has
blown
precisely
from
the
point
on
which
we
wanted
to
sail
or
has
been
so
faint
that
we
scarcely
made
one
knot
an
hour
however
on
tuesday
last
finding
ourselves
in
the
latitude
of
the
bermoothes
by
way
of
variety
a
sudden
squall
carried
away
both
our
lower
stunsails
in
the
morning
and
at
nine
in
the
evening
there
came
on
a
gale
of
wind
truly
tremendous
the
ship
pitched
and
rolled
every
minute
as
if
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
overturning
the
hencoops
floated
about
the
deck
and
many
of
the
poultry
were
found
drowned
in
them
the
next
morning
just
as
the
last
was
putting
up
the
sea
embraced
the
opportunity
of
the
window
being
open
to
whip
itself
through
and
half
filled
the
with
water
and
in
half
an
hour
more
a
mountain
of
waves
broke
over
the
vessel
and
pouring
itself
through
the
paid
the
same
compliment
to
the
with
which
it
had
already
honoured
the
after
one
about
four
in
the
morning
the
storm
abated
and
then
we
relapsed
into
our
good
old
pace
of
a
knot
an
hour
our
passengers
consist
of
a
walker
with
her
two
children
and
a
sick
surgeon
of
the
name
of
ashman
may
sunday
we
continue
to
proceed
at
such
a
that
it
has
been
thought
advisable
to
put
the
crew
upon
an
allowance
of
water
may
a
negro
me
take
my
cutacoo
a
basket
made
of
matting
and
follow
him
to
lucea
and
all
for
love
of
my

this
is
the
song
of
a
wife
whose
husband
had
been
obeahed
by
another
woman
in
consequence
of
his
rejecting
her
advances
a
negro
riddle
pretty
miss
nancy
was
going
to
market
and
she
tore
her
fine
yellow
gown
and
there
was
not
a
taylor
in
all
the
town
who
could
mend
it
this
is
a
ripe
plantain
with
a
broken
skin
the
negroes
are
also
very
fond
of
what
they
call
nancy
stories
part
of
which
is
related
and
part
sung
the
heroine
of
one
of
them
is
an
old
woman
named
mamma
luna
who
having
left
a
pot
boiling
in
her
hut
found
it
robbed
on
her
return
her
suspicions
were
divided
between
two
children
whom
she
found
at
play
near
her
door
and
some
negroes
who
had
passed
that
way
to
market
the
children
denied
the
theft
positively
it
was
necessary
for
the
negroes
in
order
to
reach
their
own
estate
to
wade
through
a
river
at
that
time
almost
dry
and
on
their
return
mammy
luna
who
it
should
seem
was
not
without
some
skill
in
witchcraft
warned
them
to
take
care
in
venturing
across
the
stream
for
that
the
water
would
infallibly
rise
and
carry
away
the
person
who
had
stolen
the
contents
of
her
pot
but
if
the
thief
would
but
confess
the
offence
she
engaged
that
no
harm
should
happen
as
she
only
wanted
to
exculpate
the
innocent
and
not
to
punish
the
guilty
one
and
all
denied
the
charge
and
several
crossed
the
river
without
fear
or
danger
but
upon
the
approach
of
a
to
the
bank
she
was
observed
to
hesitate
my
neger
my
neger
said
mammy
luna
why
you
stop
me
tink
you
savee
well
who
thief
me
this
accusation
spirited
up
the
woman
who
instantly
marched
into
the
river
singing
as
she
went
and
the
woman
s
part
is
always
chanted
frequently
in
chorus
which
the
negroes
call
taking
up
the
sing
if
da
me
eat
mammy
luna
s
drowny
me
water
drowny
drowny
my
neger
my
neger
cried
the
old
woman
me
sure
now
you
the
thief
me
see
the
water
wet
you
feet
come
back
my
neger
come
still
on
went
the
woman
and
still
continued
her
song
of
if
da
me
eat
mammy
luna
s
pease
my
neger
my
neger
repeated
mammy
luna
me
no
want
punish
you
my
pot
smell
good
and
you
come
back
my
neger
come
back
me
see
now
water
above
your
knee
but
the
woman
was
obstinate
she
continued
to
sing
and
to
advance
till
she
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
s
bed
when
down
came
a
tremendous
flood
swept
her
away
and
she
never
was
heard
of
more
while
mammy
luna
warned
the
other
negroes
never
to
take
the
property
of
another
always
to
tell
the
truth
and
at
least
if
they
should
be
betrayed
into
telling
a
lie
not
to
persist
in
it
otherwise
they
must
expect
to
perish
like
their
companion
observe
that
a
moral
is
always
an
indispensable
part
of
a
nancy
story
another
is
as
follows
two
sisters
had
always
lived
together
on
the
best
terms
but
on
the
death
of
one
of
them
the
other
treated
very
harshly
a
little
niece
who
had
been
left
to
her
care
and
made
her
a
common
drudge
to
herself
and
her
daughter
one
day
the
child
having
broken
a
was
turned
out
of
the
house
and
ordered
not
to
return
till
she
could
bring
back
as
good
a
one
as
she
was
going
along
weeping
she
came
to
a
large
under
which
was
sitting
an
old
woman
without
a
head
i
suppose
this
unexpected
sight
made
her
gaze
rather
too
earnestly
for
the
old
woman
immediately
enquired
well
my
piccaniny
what
you
see
oh
mammy
answered
the
girl
me
no
see
good
child
said
again
the
old
woman
and
good
will
come
to
not
far
distant
was
a
and
here
was
another
old
woman
without
any
more
head
than
the
former
one
the
same
question
was
asked
her
and
she
failed
not
to
give
the
same
answer
which
had
already
met
with
so
good
a
reception
still
she
travelled
forwards
and
began
to
feel
faint
through
want
of
food
when
under
a
mahogany
tree
she
not
only
saw
a
third
old
woman
but
one
who
to
her
great
satisfaction
had
got
a
head
between
her
shoulders
she
stopped
and
made
her
best
courtesy
how
day
grannie
how
day
my
piccaniny
what
matter
you
no
look
well
grannie
me
lilly
my
piccaniny
you
see
that
hut
there
s
rice
in
the
pot
take
it
and
me
but
if
you
see
one
black
puss
mind
you
give
him
him
the
child
hastened
to
profit
by
the
permission
the
one
black
puss
failed
not
to
make
its
appearance
and
was
served
first
to
its
portion
of
rice
after
which
it
departed
and
the
child
had
but
just
finished
her
meal
when
the
mistress
of
the
hut
entered
and
told
her
that
she
might
help
herself
to
three
eggs
out
of
the
but
that
she
must
not
take
any
of
the
ones
perhaps
too
she
might
find
the
black
puss
there
also
but
if
she
did
she
was
to
take
no
notice
of
her
unluckily
all
the
eggs
seemed
to
be
as
fond
of
talking
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
old
maids
and
the
moment
that
the
child
entered
the
there
was
a
cry
of
take
take
from
all
quarters
however
she
was
punctual
in
her
obedience
and
although
the
conversable
eggs
were
remarkably
fine
and
large
she
searched
about
till
at
length
she
had
collected
three
little
eggs
that
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
themselves
the
old
woman
now
dismissed
her
guest
bidding
her
to
return
home
without
fear
but
not
to
forget
to
break
one
of
the
eggs
under
each
of
the
three
trees
near
which
she
had
seen
an
old
woman
that
morning
the
first
egg
produced
a
exactly
similar
to
that
which
she
had
broken
out
of
the
second
came
a
whole
large
sugar
estate
and
out
of
the
third
a
splendid
equipage
in
which
she
returned
to
her
aunt
delivered
up
the
jug
related
that
an
old
woman
in
a
red
docker
petticoat
had
made
her
a
great
lady
and
then
departed
in
triumph
to
her
sugar
estate
stung
by
envy
the
aunt
lost
no
time
in
sending
her
own
daughter
to
search
for
the
same
good
fortune
which
had
befallen
her
cousin
she
found
the
and
the
headless
old
woman
and
had
the
same
question
addressed
to
her
but
instead
of
returning
the
same
answer
what
me
see
said
she
me
see
one
old
woman
without
him
head
now
this
reply
was
doubly
offensive
it
was
rude
because
it
reminded
the
old
lady
of
what
might
certainly
be
considered
as
a
personal
defect
and
it
was
dangerous
as
if
such
a
circumstance
were
to
come
to
the
ears
of
the
buckras
it
might
bring
her
into
trouble
women
being
seldom
known
to
walk
and
talk
without
their
heads
indeed
if
ever
except
by
the
assistance
of
obeah
bad
child
cried
the
old
woman
bad
child
and
bad
will
come
to
you
matters
were
no
better
managed
near
the
and
even
when
she
reached
the
mahogany
although
she
saw
that
the
old
woman
had
not
only
got
her
head
on
but
had
a
red
docker
besides
she
could
not
prevail
on
herself
to
say
more
than
a
short
how
day
without
calling
her
among
negroes
it
is
almost
tantamount
to
an
affront
to
address
by
the
name
without
affixing
some
term
of
relationship
such
as
grannie
or
uncle
or
my
cornwall
boy
george
told
me
one
day
that
uncle
sully
wanted
to
speak
to
why
is
sully
your
uncle
george
no
massa
me
only
call
him
so
for
however
she
received
the
permission
to
eat
rice
at
the
cottage
coupled
with
the
injunction
of
giving
a
share
to
the
black
puss
an
injunction
however
which
she
totally
disregarded
although
she
scrupled
not
to
assure
her
hostess
that
she
had
suffered
puss
to
eat
till
she
could
eat
no
more
the
old
lady
in
the
red
petticoat
seemed
to
swallow
the
lie
very
glibly
and
despatched
the
girl
to
the
for
three
eggs
as
she
had
before
done
her
cousin
but
having
been
cautioned
against
taking
the
talking
eggs
she
conceived
that
these
must
needs
be
the
most
valuable
and
therefore
made
a
point
of
selecting
those
three
which
seemed
to
be
the
greatest
gossips
of
the
whole
poultry
yard
then
lest
their
chattering
should
betray
her
disobedience
she
thought
it
best
not
to
return
into
the
hut
and
accordingly
set
forward
on
her
return
home
but
she
had
not
yet
reached
the
mahogany
tree
when
curiosity
induced
her
to
break
one
of
the
eggs
to
her
infinite
disappointment
it
proved
to
be
empty
and
she
soon
found
cause
to
wish
that
the
second
had
been
empty
too
for
on
her
dashing
it
against
the
ground
out
came
an
enormous
yellow
snake
which
flew
at
her
with
dreadful
hissings
away
ran
the
girl
a
fallen
bamboo
lay
in
her
path
she
stumbled
over
it
and
fell
in
her
fall
the
third
egg
was
broken
and
the
old
woman
without
the
head
immediately
popping
out
of
it
told
her
that
if
she
had
treated
her
as
civilly
and
had
adhered
as
closely
to
the
truth
as
her
cousin
had
done
she
would
have
obtained
the
same
good
fortune
but
that
as
she
had
shown
her
nothing
but
rudeness
and
told
her
nothing
but
lies
she
must
be
contented
to
carry
nothing
home
but
the
empty
the
old
woman
then
jumped
upon
the
yellow
snake
galloped
away
with
incredible
speed
and
never
showed
her
red
docker
in
that
part
of
the
island
any
april
at
breakfast
the
captain
was
explaining
to
me
the
dangerous
consequences
of
breaking
the
two
hours
afterwards
the
broke
and
round
swung
the
vessel
however
as
the
accident
fortunately
took
place
in
the
day
time
and
when
the
sea
was
perfectly
calm
it
was
speedily
remedied
but
this
was
talking
of
the
devil
and
his
imps
with
a
vengeance
april
during
the
early
part
of
my
voyage
i
was
extremely
afflicted
with
and
between
eight
o
clock
on
a
monday
morning
and
twelve
on
the
following
thursday
i
actually
brought
up
almost
a
thousand
lines
with
rhymes
at
the
end
of
them
having
nothing
better
to
do
at
present
i
may
as
well
copy
them
into
this
book
composed
with
such
speed
and
under
such
circumstances
i
take
it
for
granted
that
the
verses
can
not
be
very
good
but
let
them
be
ever
so
bad
i
defy
any
one
to
be
more
sick
while
reading
them
than
the
author
himself
was
while
writing
them
this
strange
story
was
found
by
me
in
an
old
italian
book
called
ii
palagio
degli
incanti
in
which
it
was
related
as
a
fact
and
stated
to
be
taken
from
the
annals
of
portugal
an
historical
work
i
will
not
vouch
for
the
truth
of
it
myself
and
at
all
events
i
earnestly
request
that
no
person
who
may
read
these
verses
will
ask
me
who
the
hero
really
was
if
he
does
i
shall
only
return
the
same
answer
which
the
lady
gave
her
husband
when
being
on
the
point
of
shipwreck
he
requested
her
to
tell
him
whether
she
had
really
ever
wronged
his
bed
my
dear
said
she
sink
or
swim
that
secret
shall
go
to
the
grave
with
the
isle
of
devils
a
metrical
tale
should
i
report
this
now
would
they
believe
me
if
i
should
say
i
saw
such
islanders
who
though
they
were
of
monstrous
shape
yet
note
their
manners
were
more
than
of
our
human
generation
you

yon

rising
crowns
the

bold
those
mossy
cliffs

guard
the

spires

domes

how
green
the
plains
how
the

bend
with
golden
fruit
the
loaded
trees

fluttering
midst
their
boughs
in
joyful
notes
myriads
of
birds
attune
their
warbling
throats

all
the

with
flowers

mark
that
giant
palm
whose
foliage
broad
and
dark
plays
on
the
rock
beneath
a
cave
spreads
wide
its
sparry
mouth
while
loosely
wave
a
thousand
creepers
dyed
with
thousand
stains
whose
wreaths
enrich
the
trees
and
cloathe
the
plains
dear
friend
how
blest
if
passed

fair
isle
with

thee
far
from

no
guilt
to
harm
us

no

the

oh

he
cried
how
bright
and
beauteous
seems
the
world
untried
i
too
like
you
in
youth
s
romantic
bowers
dreamt
not
of

nor
thorns
in

and
when
on
banks
of

the
sunbeams
shone
i
deemed
each
sparkling
flint
a
precious
stone
ah
noble
lady
learn
that
isle
so
fair
the
fields
all

and
all
balm

where
no

nor

in

haunted
caves
there
flock
the

there
satan
reigns
and

and
thence
yon
isle
is
called
the
isle
of
devils
nor
think
on

this
tale
is
given
once
hot
in
youthful
blood
when
hell
nor

much
claimed
my
thoughts
the
truth
with
shame
i
tell
holy
francis
guard
thy
votary
well
in
quest
of
water
near
that
isle
i
drew
when
lo
such
monstrous
forms
appalled
my
view
such
shrieks
i
heard
sounds
all
so
strange
and
dread
that
from
the
strand
with
shuddering
haste
i
fled
plyed
as
for
life
my
oars
nor
backward
bent
my
head
and
though
since
then
hath
flown
full
many
a
year
still
sinks
my
heart
still
shake
my
limbs
with
fear
soon
as
yon
awful
island
meets
mine
eye
cross
we
our
breasts
say
ave
and
pass
by
iv
the
isle
is
past
and
still
in
tranquil
pride
bears
the
rich
bark
its
treasures
o
er
the
tide
and
now
the
sun
ere
yet
his
lamp
he
shrouds
stains
the
pure
western
sky
with
crimson
clouds
now
from
the
sea
s
last
verge
he
sheds
his
rays
and
sinks
triumphant
in
a
golden
blaze
still
o
er
the
heavens
reflected
splendours
flow
which
make
the
world
of
waters
gleam
and
glow
wide
and
more
wide
each
billow
shines
more
bright
till
all
the
empurpled
ocean
floats
in
light
soon
as
fair
irza
marked
the
evening
s
close
grave
from

seat
the
young
enthusiast
rose
told
o
er
her
beads
and
when
the
string
was
said
ave
maria
sang
the
enraptured
maid
her
look
so
humble
so
devout
her
air
each
worldly
wish
appeared
so
lost
in
prayer
all
felt
no
thought
could
to
her
mind
be
near
that
man
her
form
could
see
her
voice
could
hear
hushed
all
the
ship
each
sailor
checked
his
glee
clasped
his
hard
hands
and
bent
his
trembling
knee
and
each
as
rose
that
soft
mysterious
strain
best
help
in
trouble
and
sweet
balm
in
pain
gazed
on
the
maid
with
mingled
awe
and
fear
damp
on
his
cheek
perceived
the
unwonted
tear
then
raised
to
heaven
his
eyes
in
earnest
prayer
and
half
believed
himself
already
there
low
too
rosalvo
knelt
nor
knew
if
now
for
mary
s
grace
or
irza
s
rose
his
vow
scarce
e
en
the
monk
forbore
to
kneel
his
child
fondly
he
viewed
and
sweetly
gravely
smiled
and
blessed
that
god
as
swelled

melting
note
who
gave
such
heavenly
powers
to

melodious
strains
oh
speed
your
flight

oh
spread

queen
for

from

thy

and
e
en
the

s

are
sealed
by
sleep
yet
mark
yon
gathering
clouds
the
moon
is
fled
mark
too
that
deathlike
stillness
deep
and
dread
and
hark
from
yon
black
cloud
an
awful
voice
pours
the
wild
chaunt
and
bids
the
winds
rejoice
song
of
the
i
marked
her
the
pennants
how
gaily
they
streamed
how
well
was
she
armed
for
resistance
the
waves
that
sustained
her
how
brightly
they
beamed
in
the
sun
s
setting
rays
and
the
sailors
all
seemed
to
forget
the

existence
but
i
marked
her
and
now
from
the
clouds
i
descend
my
spells
to
the
billows
i

i
clap
my
black
pinions
my
wand
i
extend

to

which
i
utter
now
more
and

in

i
whirl
in
my

while

and
now

mountainous

i

o

of

and

as

hurrah
i

how

shrieks
rose
in

now
all

at

no

my

to

fresh
ruin
hushed
is

storm
the
heavens
no
longer
frown
and
o
er
that
spot
where
late
the
bark
went
down
all
bright
and
smiling
flows
the
treacherous
wave
like
sunshine
playing
on
a
grave
full
rose
the
watery
moon
it
showed
a
plank
to
which
all
deadly
pale
with
tresses
dank
and
robes
of
white
on
which
the
sea
had
flung
loose
wreaths
of
unconscious
clung
a
fair
frail
form
twas
irza
to
the
shore
each
following
wave
the
virgin
nearer
bore
and
now
the
mountain
surge
overwhelmed
the
land
then
flying
left
her
on
the
strand
soon
hope
and
love
of
life
her
powers
renew
swift
towards
a
cliff
she
speeds
which
towers
in
view
nor
waits
the
wave
s
return
and
now
again
safe
on
the
shore
and
rescued
from
the
main
prostrate
she
falls
and
thanks
the
sire
of
life
whose
arm
hath
snatched
her
from
the
billowy
strife
that
duty
done
she
rose
and
gazed
around
mossed
are
the
rocks
and
flowers
bestrew
the
ground
not
distant
far
a
group
of
fragrant
trees
bend
with
their
golden
fruit
the
shakes
a
gigantic
palm
which
o
er
a
cave
its
dark
green
foliage
spreads
and
wildly
wave
their
blooming
wreaths
all
starred
with
midnight
dews
a
thousand
creeping
plants
of
thousand
hues
then
flashed
the
dreadful
truth
on
irza
s
view
that
cave
those
trees
that
giant
palm
she
knew
then
from
her
lips
for
ever
fled
the
smile
mother
of
god
she
shrieked
the
long
on
a
broken
crag
she
knelt
and
prayed
and
wearied
every
saint
for
strength
and
aid
then
speechless
heedless
senseless
lay
when
lo
strange
mutterings
near
her
roused
from
torpid
woe
her
soul
to
fresh
alarms
her
head
she
reared
and
near
her
face
an
hideous
face
appeared
but
straight
twas
gone
in
trembling
haste
she
rose
and
saw
a
ring
of
monstrous
dwarfs
inclose
her
rugged
couch
not
teniers
hand
could
paint
forms
more
grotesque
to
scare
the
tempted
saint
than
here
as
on
they
pressed
in
circling
throng
with
gnashing
teeth
seemed
for
her
blood
to
long
and
grinned
and
glared
and
gloated
quicker
grew
her
breath
death
hemmed
her
round
as
yet
tis
true
far
off
they
kept
but
soon
more
daring
grown
more
near
they
crept
oft
sharpening
on
some
stone
their
long
crookt
claws
and
still
as
on
they
came
they
screeched
and
chattered
and
their
eyes
of
flame
twinkling
and
goggling
told
what
pleasure
grim
twould
give
to
rack
and
rend
her
limb
from
limb
heaven
take
my
soul
she
cried
when
hark
a
moan
so
full
so
sad
so
strange
not
shriek
not
groan
something
scarce
earthly
breathed
above
her
head
twas
heard
and
instant
every
imp
was
fled
what
was
that
sound
what
pitying
saint
from
high
had
stooped
to
save
her
now
to
heaven
her
eye
grateful
she
raised
almighty
powers
a
form
gigantic
as
the
palm
black
as
the
storm
all
shagged
with
hair
wild
strange
in
shape
and
show
towered
on
the
loftiest
cliff
and
gazed
below
on
her
he
gazed
and
gazed
so
fixed
so
hard
like
knights
of
bronze
some
hero
s
tomb
who
guard
bright
wreaths
of
scarlet
plumes
his
temples
crowned
and
round
his
ankles
arms
and
wrists
were
wound
unnumbered
glassy
strings
of
crystals
bright
corals
and
shells
and
berries
red
and
white
on
her
he
gazed
and
floods
of
sable
fires
rolled
his
huge
eyes
and
spoke
his
fierce
desires
as
on
his
club
a
lime
he
help
heaven
thought
irza
tis
the
not
long
he
paused
he
now
with
one
quick
bound
sprang
from
the
cliff
and
lighted
on
the
ground
back
fled
the
maid
in
terror
but
her
fear
was
needless
humbly
slowly
crept
he
near
then
kissed
the
earth
his
club
before
her
laid
and
of
his
neck
her
footstool
would
have
made
but
from
his
touch
she
shrank
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
her
limbs
convulsed
her
face
all
dread
and
felt
the
cause
his
presence
sad
and
slow
he
rose
resumed
his
club
and
turn
d
to
go
reproachful
was
his
look
but
still
twas
kind
he
climb
d
the
rock
but
oft
he
gazed
behind
he
reach
d
the
cave
one
look
below
he
threw
plaintive
again
he
moan
d
and
with
slow
steps
withdrew
she
is
alone
she
breathes
again
fly
fly
ah
wretched
girl
too
late
with
frenzied
eye
scarce
gone
the
his
imps
she
sees
pour
from
the
rocks
and
drop
from
all
the
trees
with
yell
and
squeak
and
many
a
horrid
sound
and
form
a
living
fence
to
hedge
her
round
now
then
she
cried
c
all
s
over
oh
farewell
farewell
rosalvo
on
her
knee
she
fell
and
told
her
beads
with
trembling
hands
yet
still
on
came
the
throng
and
soon
with
wanton
skill
lured
by
its
coral
glow
and
cross
of
gold
one
snatch
d
her
chaplet
nor
forsook
his
hold
though
hard
she
struggled
while
more
bold
more
fierce
another
seized
her
arm
and
dared
to
pierce
with
his
sharp
teeth
its
snow
the
pure
blood
stream
d
fast
from
the
wound
and
loud
the
virgin
scream
d
and
strait
again
was
heard
that
sad
strange
moan
and
instant
all
the
dwarfs
again
were
flown
scarce
conscious
that
she
lived
scarce
knowing
why
half
grieved
half
grateful
irza
raised
her
eye
still
on
the
rock
not
dared
he
down
to
spring
dark
and
majestic
stood
the
then
lowly
knelt
and
raised
his
arm
to
wave
an
orange
bough
and
court
her
to
his
cave
lost
are
her
friends
no
help
no
hope
is
nigh
what
can
she
do
and
whither
can
she
fly
to
him
already
twice
her
life
she
owes
and
but
his
presence
now
restrains
her
foes
on
wings
of
flame
the
sun
had
left
the
main
and
peeping
from
the
trees
the
imps
too
plain
shot
darts
of
rage
from
their
green
orbs
of
sight
she
heard
their
gibberings
and
she
mark
d
their
spite
and
while
they
eyed
her
form
their
care
she
saw
to
grind
their
teeth
and
whet
each
cruel
claw
demons
alike
the
s
breast
appear
d
least
fierce
of
ills
she
chose
the
best
sought
where
profaned
her
coral
rosary
lay
then
slowly
mounted
where
he
show
d
the
way
cautious
he
led
her
tow
rds
his
lone
abode
and
clear
d
each
stone
that
might
impede
her
road
with
pain
she
trod
she
reach
d
the
cave
but
there
no
more
their
weight
her
wearied
limbs
could
bear
exhausted
fainting
anguish
terror
thirst
fatigue
o
erpower
d
her
frame
her
heart
must
burst
her
eyes
grow
dim
sunk
on
the
rock
she
lies
and
sinking
prays
she
never
more
may
rise
long
in
this
deathlike
swoon
she
lay
at
length
exhausted
nature
show
d
forth
all
its
strength
and
call
d
her
back
to
life
her
opening
eyes
beheld
a
grotto
vast
in
depth
and
size
whose
high
straight
sides
forbade
all
hopes
of
flight
the
fractured
roof
gave
ample
space
for
light
through
which
in
gorgeous
guise
the
shone
on
many
a
lucid
shell
and
brilliant
stone
through
pendent
spars
and
crystals
as
it
falls
each
beam
with
rainbow
hues
adorns
the
walls
gilds
all
the
roof
emblazes
all
the
ground
and
scatters
light
and
warmth
and
splendour
round
gently
on
pillowing
furs
reposed
her
head
with
many
a
verdant
rush
her
couch
was
spread
a
gourd
with
blushing
fruits
was
near
her
placed
whose
scent
and
colour
woo
d
alike
her
taste
and
round
her
strewn
there
bloom
d
unnumber
d
flowers
charming
her
sense
with
aromatic
powers
one
only
object
chill
d
her
blood
with
ear
far
off
removed
but
still
alas
too
near
scarce
breathing
lest
a
breath
her
sleep
might
break
there
stood
the
fiend
and
watch
d
to
see
her
wake
in
sooth
if
credit
outward
show
might
crave
than
irza
ne
er
had
nymph
an
humbler
slave
he
watched
her
every
glance
her
frown
he
fear
d
and
if
his
pains
to
meet
her
wish
appear
d
all
pains
seem
d
far
o
all
cares
appeased
and
so
she
found
but
pleasure
he
was
pleased
one
power
he
claim
d
but
claim
d
that
power
alone
still
when
he
left
her
side
a
mass
of
stone
barr
d
up
the
grotto
nor
allow
d
her
feet
to
pass
the
limits
of
her
bright
retreat
but
when
in
quest
of
food
not
forced
to
stray
in
irza
s
sight
he
wore
the
livelong
day
and
show
d
her
living
springs
and
noontide
shades
groves
and
d
glades
for
her
he
still
selects
the
sweetest
roots
the
coolest
waters
and
the
loveliest
fruits
to
deck
her
charms
the
softest
furs
he
brings
and
plucks
their
plumage
from
flamingo
wings
bids
blooming
shrubs
to
shade
her
bend
in
bowers
and
strews
her
couch
with
fragrant
herbs
and
flowers
while
many
an
grate
restrains
the
splendid
tenants
of
the
etherial
plains
then
when
she
sought
her
lonesome
grot
at
eve
and
waved
her
hand
and
warn
d
him
take
his
leave
her
will
was
his
he
breathed
his
plaintive
moan
gazed
one
last
look
then
gently
roll
d
the
stone
perhaps
such

all

as

fire
betray
d
the

and
claim
d
its
hellish

lost
lost
my

lost
the
affrighted
maid
ah
now
a
maid
no
more
distracted
said
and
wrung
her

those
words
she
scarce

would
have

but
fear
d
t
was
sin
to
pray
that

ne

admits

the
veil
of
ignorance
was
rent
in

in

of
virtue

she
knows
and
feels
and
shudders
at
the
truth
that
night
accursed
in
swoon
she
slept
then
near
her
couch
if
that
dark
demon
crept
oh
where

oh
at

what

how
then
she
beats
her
breast
how
rends
her

and
bids
with
golden
ringlets

all

on

in

opes

what
makes
her

run
back

scarce

oh
for

now
the

now
at

the

which
irza
taught

she
hears

fills
with

rends

shrieks

revived

all
is
rage
revenge
and
helpless
hopeless
pain
days
weeks
months

came
with
slow
relief
but
still
at

it
came
no

her
grief
disturbs
her

she
knows
that
groan
was
his
and
fully
feels
herself
the
wretch

is
she
rises
towards
the
grotto

mouth
she
goes
nor
dares
the
fiend
her
wandering
steps
oppose
she
seeks
the
spot
on
which
rosalvo
fell
on
which
he
died
she
knows
that
spot
too
well
but
lo
no

was
there
all

and
green
a

from

i
regret
the
loss
of
our
dead
calm
and
our
crawling
pace
of
a
knot
and
a
half
an
hour
for
during
the
last
four
days
we
have
had
nothing
but
gales
and
squalls
mountainous
waves
the
vessel
rolling
and
pitching
incessantly
and
the
sea
perpetually
pouring
in
at
the
windows
and
down
through
the
hatchway
into
the
bargain
we
are
now
sufficiently
towards
the
north
to
find
the
weather
perishingly
cold
and
we
have
neither
wood
nor
coals
enough
on
board
to
allow
a
fire
for
the
cabin
but
among
all
our
inconveniences
that
which
is
the
most
intolerable
undoubtedly
arises
from
the
sick
apothecary
it
seems
that
his
complaint
is
the
consequence
of
which
has
affected
his
liver
since
his
coming
on
board
he
has
continued
to
indulge
his
taste
and
growing
worse
as
might
be
expected
he
has
now
thought
proper
to
put
himself
in
a
state
of
salivation
the
consequence
is
that
what
with
the
mercury
and
what
with
the
man
aided
by
the
concomitant
effluvia
of
our
cargo
of
sugar

a
combination
of
villanous

much
do
all

appear
to

of

so
completely
do

seem

myself
to
be

all
over

to
the
poor
apothecary
his
mercury
annoys
us
without
any

yet
of
its
benefiting
himself

grows
worse

i
greatly

i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
exactly
the
negro
notions
concerning
the
indeed
i
believe
that
his
character
and
qualities
vary
in
different
parts
of
the
country
at
first
i
thought
that
the
term
duppy
meant
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
ghost
but
sometimes
he
is
spoken
of
as
the
duppy
as
if
there
were
but
one
and
then
he
seems
to
answer
to
the
devil
sometimes
he
is
a
kind
of
malicious
spirit
who
haunts
like
the
arabian
gouls
and
delights
in
playing
tricks
to
those
who
may
pass
that
way
on
other
occasions
he
seems
to
be
a
supernatural
attendant
on
the
practitioners
of
obeah
in
the
shape
of
some
animal
as
familiar
imps
are
supposed
to
belong
to
our
english
witches
and
this
latter
is
the
part
assigned
to
him
in
the
following
sarah
winyan
was
scarcely
ten
years
old
when
her
mother
died
and
bequeathed
to
her
considerable
property
her
father
was
already
dead
and
the
guardianship
of
the
child
devolved
upon
his
sister
who
had
always
resided
in
the
same
house
and
who
was
her
only
surviving
relation
her
mother
indeed
had
left
two
sons
by
a
former
husband
but
they
lived
at
some
distance
in
the
wood
and
seldom
came
to
see
their
mother
chiefly
from
a
rooted
aversion
to
this
aunt
who
although
from
interested
motives
she
stooped
to
flatter
her
was
haughty
and
even
suspected
of
obeahism
from
the
occasional
visits
of
an
enormous
black
dog
whom
she
called
tiger
and
whom
she
never
failed
to
feed
and
caress
with
marked
distinction
in
case
of
sarah
s
death
the
aunt
in
right
of
her
brother
was
the
heiress
of
his
property
she
was
determined
to
remove
this
obstacle
to
her
wishes
and
after
treating
her
for
some
time
with
harshness
and
even
cruelty
she
one
night
took
occasion
to
quarrel
with
her
for
some
trifling
fault
and
fairly
turned
her
out
of
doors
the
poor
girl
seated
herself
on
a
stone
near
the
house
and
endeavoured
to
beguile
the
time
by
singing
poor
me
o
poor
me
sarah
winyan
o
they
call
me
neger
neger
they
call
me
sarah
winyan
o
but
her
song
was
soon
interrupted
by
a
loud
rushing
among
the
bushes
and
the
growling
which
accompanied
it
announced
the
approach
of
the
dreaded
tiger
she
endeavoured
to
secure
herself
against
his
attacks
by
climbing
a
tree
but
it
seems
that
tiger
had
not
been
suspected
of
obeahism
without
reason
for
he
immediately
growled
out
an
assurance
to
the
girl
that
come
down
she
must
and
should
her
aunt
he
said
had
made
her
over
to
him
by
contract
and
had
turned
her
out
of
doors
that
night
for
the
express
purpose
of
giving
him
an
opportunity
of
carrying
her
away
if
she
would
descend
from
the
tree
and
follow
him
willingly
to
his
own
den
to
wait
upon
him
he
engaged
to
do
her
no
harm
but
if
she
refused
to
do
this
he
threatened
to
gnaw
down
the
tree
without
loss
of
time
and
tear
her
into
a
thousand
pieces
his
long
sharp
teeth
which
he
gnashed
occasionally
during
the
above
speech
appeared
perfectly
adequate
to
the
execution
of
his
menaces
and
sarah
judged
it
most
prudent
to
obey
his
commands
but
as
she
followed
tiger
into
the
wood
she
took
care
to
resume
her
song
of
poor
me
o
in
hopes
that
some
one
passing
near
them
might
hear
her
name
and
come
to
her
rescue
tiger
however
was
aware
of
this
and
positively
forbad
her
singing
however
she
contrived
every
now
and
then
to
loiter
behind
and
when
she
thought
him
out
of
hearing
her
poor
me
o
began
again
although
she
was
compelled
to
sing
in
so
low
a
voice
through
fear
of
her
master
that
she
had
but
faint
hopes
of
its
reaching
any
ear
but
her
own
such
was
indeed
the
event
and
tiger
conveyed
her
to
his
den
without
molestation
in
the
meanwhile
her
two
had
heard
of
their
mother
s
death
and
soon
arrived
at
the
house
to
enquire
what
was
become
of
sarah
the
aunt
received
them
with
every
appearance
of
welcome
told
them
that
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
only
surviving
parent
had
already
carried
her
niece
to
the
grave
which
she
showed
them
in
her
garden
and
acted
her
part
so
well
that
the
youths
departed
perfectly
satisfied
of
the
decease
of
their
sister
but
while
passing
through
the
wood
on
their
return
they
heard
some
one
singing
but
in
so
low
a
tone
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
the
words
as
this
part
of
the
wood
was
the
most
unfrequented
they
were
surprised
to
find
any
one
concealed
there
curiosity
induced
them
to
draw
nearer
and
they
soon
could
make
out
the
poor
me
o
poor
me
sarah
winyan
o
there
needed
no
more
to
induce
them
to
hasten
onwards
and
upon
advancing
deeper
into
the
thicket
they
found
themselves
at
the
mouth
of
a
large
cavern
in
a
rock
a
fire
was
burning
within
it
and
by
its
light
they
perceived
their
sister
seated
on
a
heap
of
stones
and
weeping
while
she
chanted
her
melancholy
ditty
in
a
low
voice
and
supported
on
her
lap
the
head
of
the
formidable
tiger
this
was
a
precaution
which
he
always
took
when
inclined
to
sleep
lest
she
should
escape
and
she
had
taken
advantage
of
his
slumbers
to
resume
her
song
in
as
low
a
tone
as
her
fears
of
waking
him
would
allow
she
saw
her
brothers
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
the
youngest
fortunately
had
a
gun
with
him
and
he
made
signs
that
sarah
should
disengage
herself
from
tiger
if
possible
it
was
long
before
she
could
summon
up
courage
enough
to
make
the
attempt
but
at
length
with
fear
and
trembling
and
moving
with
the
utmost
caution
she
managed
to
slip
a
log
of
wood
between
her
knees
and
the
frightful
head
and
at
length
drew
herself
away
without
waking
him
she
then
crept
softly
out
of
the
cavern
while
the
youngest
brother
crept
as
softly
into
it
the
monster
s
head
still
reposed
upon
the
block
of
wood
in
a
moment
it
was
blown
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
the
brothers
afterwards
cutting
the
body
into
four
parts
laid
one
in
each
quarter
of
the
from
that
time
only
were
dogs
brought
into
subjection
to
men
and
the
inhabitants
of
jamaica
would
never
have
been
able
to
subdue
those
ferocious
animals
if
tiger
had
not
been
killed
and
quartered
by
sarah
winyan
s
brothers
as
to
the
aunt
she
received
the
punishment
which
she
merited
but
i
can
not
remember
what
it
was
exactly
probably
the
brothers
killed
and
quartered
as
well
as
her
ally
or
perhaps
she
was
turned
into
a
wild
beast
and
supplied
the
vacancy
left
by
tiger
as
was
the
case
with
the
celebrated
zingha
queen
of
angola
who
although
she
embraced
christianity
on
her
and
died
according
to
the
most
orthodox
forms
of
the
romish
religion
still
had
conducted
herself
in
such
a
manner
while
alive
that
shortly
after
her
decease
the
kingdom
being
ravaged
by
a
hyena
her
subjects
could
not
be
persuaded
but
that
the
soul
of
this
most
christian
queen
had
transmigrated
into
the
body
of
the
hyena
yet
this
was
surely
doing
the
hyena
great
injustice
for
she
at
least
had
never
been
in
the
habit
of
composing
ointments
by
pounding
little
children
in
a
mortar
with
her
own
hands
an
amusement
which
zingha
had
introduced
at
the
court
of
angola
it
took
surprisingly
shortly
no
woman
thought
her
toilette
completed
unless
she
had
used
some
of
this
ointment
pounding
children
became
all
the
rage
and
ladies
who
aspired
to
be
the
leaders
of
fashion
pounded
their
own
april
from
the
french
whose
can
that
little
monster
be
its
parents
really
claim
one
s
pity
madam
that
child
belongs
to
well
i
protest
she
s
vastly
pretty
april
the
weather
gets
no
better
the
apothecary
gets
no
worse
and
both
are
as
foul
and
as
disagreeable
as
they
can
well
be
as
to
the
man
it
is
wonderful
that
he
is
still
alive
for
he
has
swallowed
nothing
for
the
last
three
weeks
except
drams
and
laudanum
he
drinks
and
he
stinks
and
he
does
nothing
else
earthly
or
celestial
the
quantity
of
spirits
which
he
pours
down
his
throat
incessantly
should
of
itself
be
sufficient
to
finish
him
but
he
seems
to
have
accustomed
himself
to
drams
as
mithridates
used
himself
to
poisons
till
his
stomach
is
completely
proof
against
them
or
like
the
scythian
princess
who
was
fed
upon
ratsbane
pap
from
her
infancy
for
the
express
purpose
of
one
day
or
other
poisoning
alexander
in
her
embraces
and
who
arrived
at
such
perfection
that
although
the
venom
did
no
harm
to
her
own
constitution
she
killed
a
condemned
criminal
with
a
single
kiss
the
consequence
was
that
hemp
fell
fifty
per
cent
and
jack
ketch
s
nose
was
put
out
of
joint
completely
for
the
devil
a
culprit
of
any
pretensions
to
taste
could
be
found
in
all
scythia
who
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
be
executed
except
by
her
royal
highness
s
own
lips
i
am
afraid
this
story
is
not
strictly
historical
and
that
we
should
look
for
it
in
vain
in
quintus
curtius
april
a
gale
of
wind
began
to
show
itself
on
monday
night
it
has
continued
to
blow
ever
since
with
increasing
violence
and
is
now
become
very
serious
the
captain
says
that
he
never
experienced
weather
so
severe
at
this
season
this
is
only
my
usual
luck
certainly
nothing
can
be
more
disagreeable
than
a
ship
on
these
occasions
the
sea
breaks
over
the
vessel
every
minute
and
it
is
really
something
awful
to
see
the
waves
raised
into
the
air
by
the
force
of
the
gale
hovering
for
a
while
over
the
ship
and
then
coming
down
upon
us
swop
to
inundate
every
thing
below
deck
as
well
as
upon
it
the
wind
is
piercingly
cold
the
floors
and
walls
are
perpetually
streaming
but
a
fire
is
quite
out
of
the
question
and
indeed
at
one
time
our
eating
appeared
to
be
out
of
the
question
too
for
at
four
o
clock
the
cook
sent
us
word
that
the
sea
put
the
out
as
fast
as
he
could
light
it
that
he
was
almost
frozen
having
been
for
the
last
eight
hours
up
to
his
waist
in
water
and
that
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
get
no
dinner
however
the
steward
coaxed
him
and
encouraged
him
and
poured
spirits
down
his
throat
and
at
last
a
dinner
of
some
kind
was
put
upon
the
table
but
it
had
not
been
there
ten
minutes
before
a
tremendous
sea
poured
itself
down
the
companion
stairs
and
through
the
hatchway
set
every
thing
on
the
table
afloat
deluged
the
cabin
ducked
most
of
the
company
and
drove
us
all
into
the
other
room
i
was
lucky
enough
to
escape
with
only
a
sprinkling
but
walker
was
soaked
through
from
head
to
foot
we
can
only
cross
the
cabin
by
creeping
along
by
the
sides
as
if
we
were
so
many
cats
walking
the
deck
even
for
the
sailors
is
absolutely
out
of
the
question
and
the
little
has
so
fairly
given
up
the
attempt
that
he
goes
crawling
about
upon
all
fours
even
our
spanish
mastiff
flora
finds
it
impossible
to
keep
her
four
legs
upon
deck
every
five
minutes
up
they
all
go
away
rolls
the
dog
over
and
over
and
when
she
gets
up
again
shakes
her
ears
and
howls
in
a
tone
of
the
most
piteous
astonishment
april
though
the
gale
was
itself
sufficiently
serious
its
effects
at
first
were
ludicrous
enough
but
yesterday
it
produced
a
consequence
truly
shocking
and
alarming
edward
sadler
the
second
mate
was
at
breakfast
in
the
steerage
the
boatswain
had
been
cutting
some
beef
with
a
large
which
he
had
afterwards
put
down
upon
the
chest
on
which
they
were
sitting
a
sudden
heel
of
the
ship
threw
them
all
to
the
other
side
of
the
cabin
the
knife
fell
with
its
haft
against
the
ladder
and
poor
edward
falling
against
it
at
least
three
inches
of
the
blade
were
forced
into
his
right
side
the
wound
was
dressed
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
but
from
its
depth
the
jaggedness
of
the
weapon
with
which
it
was
made
and
from
a
pain
which
immediately
afterwards
seized
the
poor
fellow
in
his
chest
the
apothecary
thinks
that
his
recovery
is
very
improbable
he
says
that
the
liver
is
certainly
perforated
and
so
probably
are
the
lungs
if
the
latter
have
escaped
it
must
have
been
only
by
the
breadth
of
a
hair
every
one
in
the
ship
is
distressed
beyond
measure
at
this
accident
for
the
young
man
is
a
universal
favourite
he
is
but
just
one
and
twenty
with
manners
much
superior
to
his
station
and
so
unusually
steady
as
well
as
active
that
if
providence
grants
him
life
he
can
not
fail
to
raise
himself
in
his
profession
april
edward
complains
no
longer
of
the
pain
in
his
chest
he
sleeps
well
eats
enough
has
no
fever
and
every
symptom
is
so
favourable
that
ashman
encourages
us
to
hope
that
he
has
received
no
material
injury
our
has
always
appeared
to
be
the
sulkiest
and
surliest
of
yet
on
the
day
of
edward
s
accident
he
passed
every
minute
that
he
could
command
by
the
side
of
his
sofa
kneeling
and
praying
and
watching
him
as
if
he
had
been
his
son
and
every
now
and
then
wiping
away
his
own
tears
with
the
dirtiest
of
all
possible
so
that
what
goldsmith
said
of
johnson
may
be
applied
to
this
old
man
he
has
nothing
of
a
bear
but
his
after
tearing
every
sail
in
the
ship
into
shivers
and
being
as
disagreeable
as
ever
it
could
be
the
gale
has
at
length
abated
yesterday
it
was
a
storm
and
we
were
going
to
ireland
lisbon
brest
in
short
every
where
except
to
england
it
is
a
dead
calm
and
we
are
going
nowhere
at
all
april
sunday
the
gale
has
returned
with
increased
violence
and
we
are
once
more
at
our
old
trade
of
dead
lights
however
for
this
time
the
wind
at
least
is
in
our
favour
april
the
wounded
mate
is
so
much
recovered
as
to
come
upon
deck
for
a
few
hours
and
may
now
be
considered
as
completely
out
of
danger
although
ashman
is
positive
from
his
difficulty
of
breathing
at
first
and
the
subsequent
pain
in
his
chest
that
his
lungs
must
actually
have
been
wounded
however
slightly
we
are
now
nearly
abreast
of
scilly
we
fell
in
with
several
scilly
boats
from
whom
we
obtained
a
very
acceptable
supply
of
fish
vegetables
and
newspapers
april
african
the
headman
the
king
of
a
large
district
in
africa
in
one
of
his
tours
visited
a
young
nobleman
to
whom
he
lost
a
considerable
sum
at
play
on
his
departure
he
loaded
his
host
with
caresses
and
insisted
on
his
coming
in
person
to
receive
payment
at
court
but
his
pretended
kindness
had
not
deceived
the
nurse
of
the
young
man
she
told
him
that
the
headman
was
certainly
incensed
against
him
for
having
conquered
him
at
play
and
meant
to
do
him
some
injury
that
having
been
so
positively
ordered
to
come
to
court
he
could
not
avoid
obeying
but
she
advised
him
to
take
the
where
at
a
particular
hour
he
would
find
the
king
s
youngest
and
favourite
daughter
bathing
and
she
instructed
him
how
to
behave
the
youth
reached
the
river
and
concealed
himself
till
he
saw
the
princess
enter
the
stream
alone
but
when
she
thought
fit
to
regain
the
bank
she
found
herself
extremely
what
is
become
of
my
clothes
who
has
stolen
my
clothes
if
any
one
will
bring
me
back
my
clothes
i
promise
that
no
harm
shall
happen
to
him
this
day
o
this
was
the
cue
for
which
the
youth
had
been
instructed
to
wait
here
are
your
clothes
missy
said
he
stepping
from
his
concealment
a
rogue
had
stolen
them
while
you
were
bathing
but
i
took
them
from
him
and
have
brought
them
well
young
man
i
will
keep
my
promise
to
you
you
are
going
to
court
i
know
and
i
know
also
that
the
headman
will
chop
off
your
head
unless
at
first
sight
you
can
tell
him
which
of
his
three
daughters
is
the
youngest
now
i
am
she
and
in
order
that
you
may
not
mistake
i
will
take
care
to
make
a
sign
and
then
do
not
you
fail
to
pitch
upon
the
young
man
assured
her
that
having
once
seen
her
he
never
could
possibly
mistake
her
for
any
other
and
then
set
forwards
with
a
lightened
heart
the
headman
received
him
very
graciously
feasted
him
with
magnificence
and
told
him
that
he
would
present
him
to
his
three
daughters
only
that
there
was
a
slight
rule
respecting
them
to
which
he
must
conform
whoever
could
not
point
out
which
was
the
youngest
must
immediately
lose
his
head
the
young
man
kissed
the
ground
in
obedience
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
three
little
black
dogs
now
then
the
necessity
of
the
precaution
taken
by
the
princess
was
evident
the
youth
looked
at
the
dogs
earnestly
something
induced
the
headman
to
turn
away
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
in
that
moment
one
of
the
dogs
lifted
up
its
fore
paw
this
cried
the
youth
this
is
your
youngest
daughter
and
instantly
the
dogs
vanished
and
three
young
women
appeared
in
their
stead
the
headman
was
equally
surprised
and
incensed
but
concealing
his
rage
he
professed
the
more
pleasure
at
that
discovery
because
in
consequence
the
law
of
that
country
obliged
him
to
give
his
youngest
daughter
in
marriage
to
the
person
who
should
recognise
her
and
he
charged
his
future
to
return
in
a
week
when
he
should
receive
his
bride
but
his
feigned
caresses
could
no
longer
deceive
the
young
man
as
it
was
evident
that
the
headman
practised
obeah
he
did
not
dare
to
disobey
him
and
knew
that
to
escape
by
flight
would
be
unavailing
it
was
therefore
with
melancholy
forebodings
that
he
set
out
for
court
on
the
appointed
day
and
according
to
the
advice
of
his
old
nurse
he
failed
not
to
take
the
road
which
led
by
the
river
the
princess
came
again
to
bathe
her
clothes
again
vanished
she
had
again
recourse
to
her
what
is
become
of
my
clothes
and
on
hearing
the
same
promise
of
protection
the
youth
again
made
his
appearance
here
are
your
clothes
missy
said
he
the
wind
had
blown
them
away
to
a
great
distance
i
found
them
hanging
upon
the
bushes
and
have
brought
them
back
to
probably
the
princess
thought
it
rather
singular
that
whenever
her
petticoats
were
missing
the
same
person
should
always
happen
to
be
in
the
way
to
find
them
however
as
she
was
remarkably
handsome
she
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
swallowed
the
story
like
so
much
butter
and
assured
him
of
her
protection
my
father
said
she
will
again
ask
you
which
is
the
youngest
daughter
and
as
he
suspects
me
of
having
assisted
you
before
he
threatens
to
chop
off
head
instead
of
yours
should
i
disobey
him
a
second
time
he
will
therefore
watch
me
too
closely
to
allow
of
my
making
any
sign
to
you
but
still
i
will
contrive
something
to
distinguish
me
from
my
sisters
and
do
you
examine
us
narrowly
till
you
find
as
she
had
foretold
the
headman
no
sooner
saw
his
destined
enter
than
he
told
him
that
he
should
immediately
receive
his
bride
but
that
if
he
did
not
immediately
point
her
out
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
sentenced
him
to
lose
his
head
upon
which
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
three
large
black
cats
so
exactly
similar
in
every
respect
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
the
youth
was
at
length
on
the
point
of
giving
up
the
attempt
in
despair
when
it
struck
him
that
each
of
the
cats
had
a
slight
thread
passed
round
its
neck
and
that
while
the
threads
of
two
were
scarlet
that
of
the
third
was
blue
is
your
youngest
daughter
cried
he
snatching
up
the
cat
with
the
blue
thread
the
headman
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
conceive
by
what
means
he
had
made
the
discovery
but
could
not
deny
the
fact
for
there
stood
the
princesses
in
their
own
shape
he
therefore
affected
to
be
greatly
pleased
gave
him
his
bride
and
made
a
great
feast
which
was
followed
by
a
ball
but
in
the
midst
of
it
the
princess
whispered
her
lover
to
follow
her
silently
into
the
garden
here
she
told
him
that
an
old
obeah
woman
who
had
been
her
father
s
nurse
had
warned
him
that
if
his
youngest
daughter
should
live
to
see
the
day
after
her
wedding
he
would
lose
his
power
and
his
life
together
that
she
therefore
was
sure
of
his
intending
to
destroy
both
herself
and
her
bridegroom
that
night
in
their
sleep
but
that
being
aware
of
all
these
circumstances
she
had
watched
him
so
narrowly
as
to
get
possession
of
some
of
his
magical
secrets
which
might
possibly
enable
her
to
counteract
his
cruel
designs
she
then
gathered
a
rose
picked
up
a
pebble
filled
a
small
phial
with
water
from
a
rivulet
and
thus
provided
she
and
her
lover
betook
themselves
to
flight
upon
a
couple
of
the
swiftest
steeds
in
her
father
s
stables
it
was
midnight
before
the
headman
missed
them
his
rage
was
excessive
and
immediately
mounting
his
great
horse
dandy
he
set
forwards
in
pursuit
of
the
lovers
now
dandy
galloped
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
a
minute
the
princess
was
soon
aware
of
her
pursuer
without
loss
of
time
she
pulled
the
rose
to
pieces
scattered
the
leaves
behind
her
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
instantly
grow
up
into
a
wood
of
briars
so
strong
and
so
thickly
planted
that
dandy
vainly
attempted
to
force
his
way
through
them
but
alas
this
fence
was
but
of
a
very
perishable
nature
in
the
time
that
it
would
have
taken
to
wither
its
parent
the
briars
withered
away
and
dandy
was
soon
able
to
trample
them
down
while
he
continued
his
pursuit
now
then
the
pebble
was
thrown
in
his
passage
it
burst
into
forty
pieces
and
every
piece
in
a
minute
became
a
rock
as
lofty
as
the
andes
but
the
andes
themselves
would
have
offered
no
insurmountable
obstacles
to
dandy
who
bounded
from
precipice
to
precipice
and
the
lovers
and
the
headman
could
once
more
clearly
distinguish
each
other
by
the
first
beams
of
the
rising
sun
the
headman
roared
and
threatened
and
brandished
a
monstrous
sabre
dandy
tore
up
the
ground
as
he
ran
neighed
louder
than
thunder
and
gained
upon
the
fugitives
every
moment
despair
left
the
princess
no
choice
and
she
violently
dashed
her
phial
upon
the
ground
instantly
the
water
which
it
contained
swelled
itself
into
a
tremendous
torrent
which
carried
away
every
thing
before
it
rocks
trees
and
houses
and
the
horse
and
his
rider
were
carried
away
among
the
hic
finis
priami
fatorum
there
was
an
end
of
the
headman
and
dandy
the
princess
then
returned
to
court
where
she
raised
a
strong
party
for
herself
seized
her
two
sisters
who
were
no
better
than
their
father
and
had
assisted
him
in
his
witchcraft
and
having
put
them
and
all
their
partisans
to
death
by
a
summary
mode
of
proceeding
she
established
herself
and
her
husband
on
the
throne
as
headman
and
it
was
from
this
time
that
the
kings
of
africa
have
been
uniformly
mild
and
benevolent
sovereigns
till
then
they
were
all
tyrants
and
tyrants
they
would
all
still
have
continued
if
this
virtuous
princess
had
not
changed
the
face
of
things
by
drowning
her
father
strangling
her
two
sisters
and
chopping
off
the
heads
of
two
or
three
dozen
of
her
nearest
and
dearest
relations
it
seems
to
be
an
indispensable
requisite
for
a
that
it
should
contain
a
witch
or
a
duppy
or
in
short
some
marvellous
personage
or
other
it
is
a
kind
of
pièce
à
machines
but
the
creole
slaves
are
very
fond
of
another
species
of
tale
which
they
call
and
which
bear
the
same
relation
to
a
which
a
farce
does
to
a
tragedy
the
following
is
a
specimen
a
man
who
had
two
wives
divided
his
into
two
parts
and
proposed
that
each
of
the
women
should
cultivate
one
half
they
were
ready
to
do
their
proper
share
but
insisted
that
the
husband
should
at
least
take
his
third
of
the
work
however
when
they
were
to
set
out
the
man
was
taken
so
ill
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
move
he
quite
roared
with
pain
and
complained
bitterly
of
a
large
lump
which
had
formed
itself
on
his
cheek
during
the
night
the
wives
did
what
they
could
to
relieve
him
but
in
vain
they
boiled
a
for
him
but
he
was
too
ill
to
swallow
a
morsel
and
at
length
they
were
obliged
to
leave
him
and
go
to
take
care
of
the
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
the
husband
became
perfectly
well
emptied
the
contents
of
the
pot
with
great
appetite
and
enjoyed
himself
in
ease
and
indolence
till
evening
when
he
saw
his
wives
returning
and
immediately
he
became
worse
than
ever
one
of
the
women
was
quite
shocked
to
see
the
size
to
which
the
lump
had
increased
during
her
absence
she
begged
to
examine
it
but
although
she
barely
touched
it
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
as
gingerly
as
possible
it
was
so
tender
that
the
fellow
screamed
with
agony
unluckily
the
other
woman
s
manners
were
by
no
means
so
delicate
and
seizing
him
forcibly
by
the
head
to
examine
it
she
undesignedly
happened
to
hit
him
a
great
knock
on
the
jaw
and
lo
and
behold
out
flew
a
large
lime
which
he
had
crammed
into
it
upon
which
both
his
wives
fell
upon
him
like
two
furies
beat
him
out
of
the
house
and
whenever
afterwards
he
begged
them
to
go
to
the
they
told
him
that
he
had
got
no
lime
in
his
mouth
and
obliged
him
from
that
time
forwards
to
do
the
whole
work
a
negro
was
brought
to
england
and
the
first
point
shown
him
being
the
chalky
cliffs
of
dover
o
ki
he
said
me
know
now
what
makes
the
buckras
all
so
white
may
we
once
more
saw
the
lizard
the
first
point
of
england
and
indeed
it
was
full
time
that
we
should
besides
that
our
provisions
were
nearly
exhausted
by
the
length
of
the
voyage
our
crew
was
in
a
great
measure
composed
of
fellows
of
the
most
worthless
description
and
the
captain
lately
discovered
that
some
of
them
had
contrived
to
break
a
secret
passage
into
the
hold
where
they
had
broached
the
and
had
already
passed
several
nights
in
drinking
with
lighted
candles
a
single
spark
would
have
been
sufficient
to
blow
us
all
up
to
the
moon
june
saturday
we
took
our
river
pilot
on
board
and
on
wednesday
the
we
reached
gravesend
i
went
on
shore
at
nine
in
the
morning
and
here
i
conclude
my
november
wednesday
i
left
london
and
embarked
for
jamaica
on
board
the
same
vessel
commanded
by
the
same
captain
which
conveyed
me
thither
in
we
did
not
reach
the
downs
till
sunday
the
after
experiencing
in
our
passage
a
severe
gale
of
wind
which
broke
the
bowsprit
of
a
vessel
in
our
sight
but
did
no
mischief
to
ourselves
on
arriving
in
the
downs
we
found
all
the
flags
lowered
half
way
down
the
masts
which
is
a
signal
of
mourning
and
we
now
learnt
that
in
a
few
hours
after
giving
birth
to
a
son
the
princess
charlotte
of
wales
had
expired
at
two
on
thursday
morning
november
sunday
peaceful
slumbering
on
the
here
we
are
still
in
the
downs
and
no
symptoms
of
a
probable
removal
indeed
when
we
weighed
our
anchor
at
gravesend
it
gave
us
a
broad
hint
that
there
was
no
occasion
as
yet
for
giving
ourselves
the
trouble
for
before
it
could
be
got
on
board
the
cable
was
suffered
to
slip
and
down
again
went
the
anchor
carrying
along
with
it
one
of
the
men
who
happened
to
be
standing
upon
it
at
the
moment
and
who
in
consequence
went
plump
to
the
bottom
luckily
the
fellow
could
swim
so
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
on
board
again
and
no
harm
done
november
we
resumed
our
voyage
with
fine
weather
but
wind
so
perverse
that
we
did
not
arrive
in
sight
of
portsmouth
till
the
evening
of
the
a
pilot
came
on
board
and
conveyed
us
into
spithead
november
this
morning
we
quitted
portsmouth
and
this
evening
we
returned
to
it
the
needle
rocks
were
already
in
sight
when
the
wind
failed
completely
there
was
no
getting
through
the
passage
and
the
dread
of
a
gale
would
not
admit
of
our
remaining
in
so
dangerous
a
roadstead
so
we
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
mad
bess
s
example
and
return
to
the
place
whence
we
we
are
now
anchored
upon
the
motherbank
about
two
miles
from
ryde
in
the
isle
of
wight
november
sunday
edward
the
young
man
who
was
so
dangerously
wounded
on
our
return
from
my
former
voyage
to
jamaica
is
now
chief
mate
of
the
vessel
and
feels
no
other
inconvenience
from
his
accident
except
a
slight
difficulty
in
raising
his
left
arm
above
his
head
december
monday
here
we
are
still
riding
at
anchor
with
no
better
consolation
than
that
of
klopstock
s
halfdevil
abadonna
the
consciousness
that
others
are
deeper
damned
than
ourselves
another
ship
belonging
to
the
same
proprietor
left
the
west
india
docks
three
weeks
before
us
and
here
she
is
still
rocking
cheek
by
jowl
alongside
of
us
one
writ
with
us
in
sour
misfortune
s
december
a
tolerably
fair
breeze
at
length
enabled
us
to
set
sail
once
more
december
wednesday
i
had
often
heard
talk
of
a
hell
upon
earth
and
now
i
have
a
perfect
idea
of
a
hell
upon
it
must
be
precisely
our
vessel
during
the
last
three
weeks
at
twelve
at
noon
upon
the
we
passed
plymouth
and
were
actually
in
sight
of
the
lizard
point
when
the
wind
suddenly
became
completely
foul
and
drove
us
back
into
the
channel
it
continued
to
strengthen
gradually
but
rapidly
and
by
the
time
that
night
arrived
we
had
a
violent
gale
which
blew
incessantly
till
the
middle
of
sunday
the
when
we
were
glad
to
find
ourselves
once
more
in
sight
of
plymouth
and
took
advantage
of
a
temporary
abatement
of
the
wind
to
seek
refuge
in
the
sound
here
however
we
soon
found
that
we
had
but
little
reason
to
rejoice
at
the
change
of
our
situation
the
sound
was
already
crowded
with
vessels
of
all
descriptions
and
as
we
arrived
so
late
the
only
mooring
still
unoccupied
placed
us
so
near
the
rocks
on
one
side
and
another
vessel
astern
that
the
captain
confessed
that
he
should
feel
considerable
anxiety
if
the
gale
should
return
with
its
former
violence
so
of
course
about
eleven
at
night
the
gale
return
not
indeed
with
its
former
violence
but
with
its
violence
increased
tenfold
and
once
we
were
in
very
imminent
danger
from
our
ship
s
swinging
round
by
a
sudden
squall
and
narrowly
escaping
coming
in
contact
with
the
ship
astern
which
had
not
it
seems
allowed
itself
sufficient
cable
luckily
we
just
missed
her
and
our
cables
for
both
our
anchors
were
down
being
new
and
good
we
rode
out
the
storm
without
driving
or
meeting
with
any
accident
whatever
the
next
day
was
squally
and
in
spite
of
the
breakwater
the
rocking
of
the
ship
from
the
violent
agitation
of
the
waves
by
the
late
stormy
weather
was
almost
insupportable
however
on
the
the
wind
took
a
more
favourable
turn
though
in
so
slight
a
degree
that
the
pilot
expressed
great
doubts
whether
it
would
last
long
to
do
us
any
service
but
the
captain
felt
his
situation
in
plymouth
sound
so
uneasy
that
he
resolved
at
least
to
make
the
attempt
and
so
we
crept
once
more
into
the
channel
in
a
few
hours
the
breeze
strengthened
about
midnight
we
passed
the
lights
upon
the
lizard
and
the
next
morning
england
was
at
length
out
of
sight
this
cessation
of
ill
luck
soon
proved
to
be
only
pour
mieux
the
gale
it
seems
had
only
stopped
to
take
breath
about
four
in
the
afternoon
of
wednesday
the
wind
began
to
rise
again
and
from
that
time
till
the
middle
of
the
it
blew
a
complete
storm
day
and
night
with
only
an
occasional
intermission
of
two
or
three
hours
at
a
time
every
one
in
the
ship
declared
that
they
had
never
before
experienced
so
obstinate
a
persecution
of
severe
weather
every
rag
of
sail
was
obliged
to
be
taken
down
the
sea
was
blown
up
into
mountains
and
poured
itself
over
the
deck
repeatedly
the
noise
was
dreadful
and
as
it
lasted
incessantly
to
sleep
was
impossible
and
i
passed
ten
nights
one
after
another
without
closing
my
eyes
so
that
the
pain
in
the
nerves
of
them
at
length
became
almost
intolerable
and
i
began
to
be
seriously
afraid
of
going
blind
in
truth
the
captain
could
not
well
have
pitched
upon
a
set
of
passengers
worse
calculated
to
undergo
the
trial
of
a
passage
so
rough
as
for
myself
my
brain
is
so
weak
that
the
continuation
of
any
violent
noise
makes
me
absolutely
and
a
going
off
suddenly
is
quite
sufficient
at
any
time
to
set
every
nerve
shaking
from
the
crown
of
my
head
to
the
sole
of
my
foot
then
we
had
a
young
lady
who
was
ready
to
die
of
seasickness
and
an
old
one
who
was
little
better
through
fright
and
i
had
an
italian
servant
into
the
bargain
who
was
as
sick
as
the
young
lady
and
as
frightened
as
the
old
one
the
poor
fellow
had
never
been
on
board
a
ship
before
and
with
every
crack
which
the
vessel
gave
he
thought
that
to
be
sure
she
was
splitting
right
in
half
the
sailors
too
appeared
to
be
quite
knocked
up
from
the
unremitting
fatigue
to
which
they
were
subjected
by
the
perseverance
of
this
dreadful
weather
several
of
them
were
ill
and
one
poor
fellow
actually
died
and
was
committed
to
the
ocean
to
make
matters
still
worse
during
the
first
week
the
wind
was
as
foul
as
it
could
blow
and
we
passed
it
in
running
backwards
and
forwards
without
advancing
a
step
towards
our
object
till
at
length
every
drop
of
my
very
small
stock
of
patience
was
exhausted
and
i
could
no
longer
resist
suggesting
our
returning
to
port
rather
than
continue
buffeting
about
in
the
chops
of
the
channel
so
much
to
the
damage
of
the
ship
and
all
contained
in
her
a
change
of
wind
however
gave
a
complete
answer
to
this
proposal
on
thursday
it
became
favourable
as
to
the
prosecution
of
our
voyage
but
its
fury
continued
unabated
till
the
evening
of
the
it
then
gradually
died
away
and
left
us
becalmed
before
the
island
of
madeira
where
we
are
now
rolling
backwards
and
forwards
in
sight
of
its
capital
funchal
on
the
of
december
being
seven
immortal
weeks
since
my
departure
from
gravesend
the
evening
sun
is
now
very
brilliant
and
shines
full
upon
the
island
the
rocks
of
which
are
finely
broken
the
height
of
the
mountains
cause
their
tops
to
be
lost
in
the
clouds
the
sides
are
covered
with
plantations
of
vines
and
forests
of
cedars
and
the
white
edifices
of
funchal
built
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
shore
have
a
truly
picturesque
appearance
we
are
now
riding
between
the
island
and
an
isolated
group
of
inaccessible
rocks
called
the
deserters
and
the
effect
of
the
scene
altogether
is
beautiful
in
the
extreme
the
dezertas
december
a
light
breeze
sprang
up
in
the
night
and
this
morning
madeira
was
no
longer
visible
december
wednesday
we
are
now
in
the
latitudes
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
the
horse
during
the
union
of
america
and
great
britain
great
numbers
of
horses
used
to
be
exported
from
the
latter
and
the
winds
in
these
latitudes
are
so
capricious
squally
and
troublesome
in
every
respect
now
a
gale
and
then
a
dead
calm
now
a
fair
wind
and
the
next
moment
a
foul
one
that
more
horses
used
to
die
in
this
portion
of
the
passage
than
during
all
the
remainder
of
it
these
latitudes
from
thence
obtained
their
present
appellation

from
to

january
thursday
on
this
day
on
my
former
voyage
i
landed
at
black
river
now
we
are
still
at
some
distance
from
the
line
and
are
told
that
we
can
not
expect
to
reach
jamaica
in
less
than
three
weeks
even
with
favourable
breezes
and
our
breezes
at
present
are
favourable
nothing
but
light
winds
or
else
dead
calms
two
knots
an
hour
and
obliged
to
be
thankful
even
for
that
this
is
weary
work
january
saturday
on
saturday
the
we
managed
to
crawl
over
the
line
and
had
no
sooner
got
to
the
other
side
of
it
than
we
were
completely
becalmed
and
even
when
we
resumed
our
progress
it
was
at
such
a
pace
that
a
careless
observer
might
have
been
pardoned
for
mistaking
our
manner
of
moving
for
a
downright
standing
still
day
after
day
produced
nothing
better
for
us
than
baffling
winds
so
light
that
we
scarcely
made
two
miles
an
hour
and
so
variable
that
the
sails
could
be
scarcely
set
in
one
direction
before
it
became
necessary
to
shift
them
to
another
while
the
monotony
of
our
voyage
was
only
broken
by
an
occasional
thunderstorm
the
catching

brown
from
carthagena
white
from
north
america
and
from
the
cape
de
verd
islands
on
the
afternoon
of
the
one
of
them
was
at
no
very
great
distance
from
us
she
hoisted
english
colours
on
seeing
ours
but
there
was
little
doubt
from
her
peculiar
construction
and
general
appearance
that
she
was
a
privateer
from
carthagena
she
set
her
head
towards
us
and
seemed
to
be
doing
her
best
to
come
to
a
nearer
acquaintance
but
the
same
calm
which
hindered
us
from
bravely
running
away
from
her
hindered
her
also
from
reaching
us
although
at
nightfall
she
seemed
to
have
gained
upon
us
in
the
night
we
had
a
violent
and
the
next
morning
she
was
not
to
be
seen
still
we
continued
to
creep
and
to
crawl
grumbling
and
growling
till
on
sunday
the
the
wind
came
at
last
the
trade
wind
began
to
blow
with
all
its
might
and
main
right
in
the
vessel
s
poop
and
sent
us
forward
at
the
rate
of
miles
a
day
we
passed
between
deseada
and
antigua
in
the
night
of
the
and
on
the
the
rising
sun
showed
us
the
island
mountain
of
montserrat
the
sight
of
which
was
scarcely
less
agreeable
to
our
eyes
from
its
romantic
beauty
than
welcome
from
its
giving
us
the
assurance
that
our
voyage
is
at
length
drawing
towards
its
termination
january
yesterday
morning
a
miniature
shark
chose
to
swallow
the
bait
laid
for
dolphins
and
in
consequence
soon
made
his
appearance
upon
deck
it
was
a
very
young
one
not
above
three
feet
long
i
ordered
a
slice
of
him
to
be
broiled
at
dinner
but
he
was
by
no
means
so
good
as
a
dolphin
but
still
there
was
nothing
in
the
taste
so
unpalatable
as
to
prevent
the
flesh
from
being
very
acceptable
in
the
absence
of
more
delicate
food
in
the
evening
a
bird
about
the
size
of
a
large
pigeon
flew
on
board
and
was
knocked
down
by
the
mate
with
his
hat
it
was
sulky
and
would
not
be
persuaded
to
eat
any
thing
that
was
offered
so
he
was
suffered
to
escape
this
morning
it
was
beautifully
shaped
with
a
wings
of
an
extraordinary
spread
in
comparison
with
the
smallness
of
the
body
a
long
sharp
bill
black
and
polished
like
a
piece
of
jet
and
eyes
remarkably
large
and
brilliant
the
head
back
and
outside
of
the
wings
were
of
a
brownish
slate
colour
and
the
rest
of
his
feathers
of
the
most
dazzling
whiteness
it
is
called
a
january
saturday
our
favourable
breeze
lasted
till
tuesday
the
when
having
brought
us
half
way
between
domingo
and
jamaica
it
died
away
and
we
dragged
on
at
the
rate
of
two
or
three
miles
an
hour
till
thursday
afternoon
which
placed
us
at
the
mouth
of
black
river
if
we
had
arrived
one
hour
earlier
we
could
have
immediately
entered
the
harbour
but
with
our
usual
good
fortune
we
were
just
too
late
for
the
daylight
we
therefore
did
not
drop
anchor
till
two
o
clock
on
friday
before
the
town
of
black
river
and
on
saturday
morning
at
four
o
clock
i
embarked
in
the
ship
s
cutter
for
savannah
la
mar
every
one
assured
us
that
we
could
not
fail
to
have
a
favourable
seabreeze
the
whole
way
and
that
we
should
be
on
land
by
eight
instead
of
which
what
little
wind
there
was
veered
round
from
one
point
of
the
compass
to
the
other
with
the
most
indefatigable
caprice
and
we
were
not
on
shore
till
eleven
here
i
found
hill
who
luckily
had
his
phaëton
ready
in
which
he
immediately
conveyed
me
once
more
to
my
own
estate
the
accounts
of
the
general
behaviour
of
my
negroes
is
reasonably
good
and
they
all
express
themselves
satisfied
with
their
situation
and
their
superintendents
yet
among
upwards
of
three
hundred
and
thirty
negroes
and
with
a
greater
number
of
females
than
men
in
spite
of
all
indulgences
and
inducements
not
more
than
twelve
or
thirteen
children
have
been
added
annually
to
the
list
of
the
births
on
the
other
hand
this
last
season
has
been
generally
unhealthy
all
over
the
island
and
more
particularly
so
in
my
parish
so
that
i
have
lost
several
negroes
some
of
them
young
strong
and
valuable
labourers
in
every
respect
and
in
consequence
my
sum
total
is
rather
diminished
than
increased
since
my
last
visit
i
had
been
so
positively
assured
that
the
custom
of
plunging
negro
infants
immediately
upon
their
being
born
into
a
tub
of
cold
water
infallibly
preserved
them
from
the
danger
of
tetanus
that
on
leaving
jamaica
i
had
ordered
this
practice
to
be
adopted
uniformly
the
negro
mothers
however
took
a
prejudice
against
it
into
their
heads
and
have
been
so
obstinate
in
their
opposition
that
it
was
thought
unadvisable
to
attempt
the
enforcing
this
regulation
from
this
and
other
causes
i
have
lost
several
infants
but
i
am
told
that
on
other
estates
in
the
neighbourhood
they
have
been
still
more
unfortunate
in
regard
to
their
children
and
one
was
named
to
me
on
which
sixteen
were
carried
off
in
the
course
of
three
days
january
monday
the
joy
of
the
negroes
on
my
return
was
quite
sufficiently
vociferous
and
they
were
allowed
today
for
a
holiday
they
set
themselves
to
singing
and
dancing
yesterday
in
order
to
lose
no
time
and
to
show
their
gratitude
for
the
indulgence
not
one
of
the
five
chose
to
go
to
their
watch
last
night
the
consequence
was
that
the
cattle
made
their
escape
and
got
into
one
of
my
very
best
the
alarm
was
given
my
own
servants
and
some
of
the
head
people
had
grace
enough
to
run
down
to
the
scene
of
action
but
the
greatest
part
remained
quietly
in
the
beating
the
and
singing
their
joy
for
my
arrival
with
the
whole
strength
of
their
lungs
but
without
thinking
it
in
the
least
necessary
to
move
so
much
as
a
in
my
service
the
cattle
were
at
length
replaced
in
their
pen
but
not
till
the
had
been
ruined
irretrievably
such
is
negro
gratitude
and
such
my
reward
for
all
that
i
have
suffered
on
to
be
sure
as
yet
there
could
not
be
a
more
expedition
than
my
present
one
i
only
learned
yesterday
that
before
making
the
island
of
madeira
an
algerine
corsair
was
actually
in
sight
and
near
enough
to
discern
the
turbans
of
the
crew
but
we
lost
each
other
through
the
violence
of
the
gale
january
there
is
a
popular
negro
song
the
burden
of
which
is
take
him
to
the
gulley
take
him
to
the
gulley
but
bringee
back
the
frock
and
oh
massa
massa
me
no
deadee
yet
take
him
to
the
gulley
take
him
to
the
gulley
carry
him
along
this
alludes
to
a
transaction
which
took
place
some
thirty
years
ago
on
an
estate
in
this
neighbourhood
called
the
owner
of
which
i
think
the
name
was
bedward
is
quoted
as
the
cruellest
proprietor
that
ever
disgraced
jamaica
it
was
his
constant
practice
whenever
a
sick
negro
was
pronounced
incurable
to
order
the
poor
wretch
to
be
carried
to
a
solitary
vale
upon
his
estate
called
the
gulley
where
he
was
thrown
down
and
abandoned
to
his
fate
which
fate
was
generally
to
be
half
devoured
by
the
before
death
had
put
an
end
to
his
sufferings
by
this
proceeding
the
avaricious
owner
avoided
the
expence
of
maintaining
the
slave
during
his
last
illness
and
in
order
that
he
might
be
as
little
a
loser
as
possible
he
always
enjoined
the
negro
bearers
of
the
dying
man
to
strip
him
naked
before
leaving
the
gulley
and
not
to
forget
to
bring
back
his
frock
and
the
board
on
which
he
had
been
carried
down
one
poor
creature
while
in
the
act
of
being
removed
screamed
out
most
piteously
that
he
was
not
dead
yet
and
implored
not
to
be
left
to
perish
in
the
gulley
in
a
manner
so
horrible
his
cries
had
no
effect
upon
his
master
but
operated
so
forcibly
on
the
less
marble
hearts
of
his
that
in
the
night
some
of
them
removed
him
back
to
the
negro
village
privately
and
nursed
him
there
with
so
much
care
that
he
recovered
and
left
the
estate
unquestioned
and
undiscovered
unluckily
one
day
the
master
was
passing
through
kingston
when
on
turning
the
corner
of
a
street
suddenly
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
negro
whom
he
had
supposed
long
ago
to
have
been
picked
to
the
bones
in
the
gulley
of
he
immediately
seized
him
claimed
him
as
his
slave
and
ordered
his
attendants
to
convey
him
to
his
house
but
the
fellow
s
cries
attracted
a
crowd
round
them
before
he
could
be
dragged
away
he
related
his
melancholy
story
and
the
singular
manner
in
which
he
had
recovered
his
life
and
liberty
and
the
public
indignation
was
so
forcibly
excited
by
the
shocking
tale
that
bedward
was
glad
to
save
himself
from
being
torn
to
pieces
by
a
precipitate
retreat
from
kingston
and
never
ventured
to
advance
his
claim
to
the
negro
a
second
time
january
a
man
has
been
tried
at
kingston
for
cruel
treatment
of
a
sambo
female
slave
called
amey
she
had
no
friends
to
support
her
cause
nor
any
other
evidence
to
prove
her
assertions
than
the
apparent
truth
of
her
statement
and
the
marks
of
having
been
branded
in
five
different
places
the
result
was
that
the
master
received
a
most
severe
reprimand
for
his
inhuman
conduct
and
was
sentenced
to
close
confinement
for
six
months
while
the
slave
in
consequence
of
her
sufferings
was
restored
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
her
freedom
it
appears
to
me
that
nothing
could
afford
so
much
relief
to
the
negroes
under
the
existing
system
of
jamaica
as
the
substituting
the
labour
of
animals
for
that
of
slaves
in
agriculture
whereever
such
a
measure
is
practicable
on
leaving
the
island
i
impressed
this
wish
of
mine
upon
the
minds
of
my
agents
with
all
my
power
but
the
only
result
has
been
the
creating
a
very
considerable
additional
expense
in
the
purchase
of
ploughs
oxen
and
farming
implements
the
awkwardness
and
still
more
the
obstinacy
of
the
few
negroes
whose
services
were
indispensable
was
not
to
be
overcome
they
broke
plough
after
plough
and
ruined
beast
after
beast
till
the
attempt
was
abandoned
in
despair
however
it
was
made
without
the
most
essential
ingredient
for
success
the
superintendence
of
an
english
ploughman
and
such
of
the
ploughs
as
were
of
could
not
be
repaired
when
once
broken
and
therefore
ought
not
to
have
been
adopted
but
i
am
told
that
in
several
other
parts
of
the
island
the
plough
has
been
introduced
and
completely
successful
another
of
my
farming
speculations
answered
no
better
this
was
to
improve
the
breed
of
cattle
in
the
county
for
which
purpose
lord
holland
and
myself
sent
over
four
of
the
finest
bulls
that
could
be
procured
in
england
one
of
them
got
a
trifling
hurt
in
its
passage
from
the
vessel
to
land
but
the
remaining
three
were
deposited
in
their
respective
pens
without
the
least
apparent
damage
they
were
taken
all
possible
care
of
houses
appropriated
to
shelter
them
from
the
sun
and
rain
and
in
short
no
means
of
preserving
their
health
was
neglected
yet
shortly
after
their
arrival
in
jamaica
they
evidently
began
to
decline
their
blood
was
converted
into
urine
they
paid
no
sort
of
attention
to
the
cows
who
were
confined
in
the
same
paddock
and
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
not
one
was
in
existence
two
having
died
upon
the
same
day
the
injured
one
having
been
bled
the
most
copiously
in
consequence
of
its
hurt
was
that
which
survived
the
longest
january
some
days
ago
a
negro
woman
who
has
lost
four
children
and
has
always
been
a
most
affectionate
mother
brought
the
fifth
a
remarkably
fine
infant
into
the
hospital
she
complained
of
its
having
caught
cold
a
fever
and
so
on
but
nothing
administered
was
of
use
and
its
manner
of
breathing
made
the
doctor
enquire
whether
the
child
had
not
had
a
fall
the
mother
denied
this
most
positively
and
her
fondness
for
the
infant
admitted
no
doubt
of
her
veracity
still
the
child
grew
worse
and
worse
still
the
question
about
the
fall
was
repeated
and
as
constantly
denied
until
luckily
being
made
in
the
presence
of
a
the
latter
immediately
exclaimed
that
to
her
certain
knowledge
the
infant
had
really
had
a
fall
for
that
the
mother
having
fastened
it
behind
her
back
the
knot
of
the
handkerchief
had
slipped
and
the
baby
had
fallen
upon
the
it
is
false
answered
the
mother
the
child
did
not
fall
for
when
the
knot
slipped
i
had
time
to
catch
it
by
the
foot
and
so
i
saved
it
from
falling
just
as
its
head
struck
against
the
fear
of
being
blamed
as
having
occasioned
the
baby
s
illness
through
her
own
carelessness
had
induced
her
to
adopt
this
equivocation
and
its
life
had
nearly
been
the
sacrifice
of
her
duplicity
a
proper
mode
of
treatment
was
now
adopted
without
loss
of
time
their
beneficial
effect
was
immediately
visible
and
the
poor
little
negro
is
now
recovering
rapidly
but
certainly
there
is
no
folly
and
imprudence
like
unto
negro
folly
and
imprudence
one
of
my
best
disposed
and
most
sensible
eboes
has
had
a
violent
fever
lately
but
was
so
nearly
well
as
to
be
put
upon
a
course
of
bark
on
wednesday
morning
a
son
of
his
died
of
a
practice
which
neither
severity
nor
indulgence
could
induce
him
to
discontinue
the
boy
was
buried
that
night
according
to
african
customs
accompanied
with
dancing
singing
drinking
eating
and
riot
of
all
kinds
and
the
father
although
the
negro
on
my
estate
and
remarkably
fond
of
his
children
danced
and
drank
to
such
an
excess
that
i
found
him
on
the
following
morning
in
a
raging
fever
and
worse
than
he
was
when
he
first
entered
the
hospital
i
had
warned
him
against
the
consequences
of
the
funeral
reminded
him
of
the
dangerous
malady
from
which
he
was
but
just
recovering
and
he
had
promised
solemnly
to
be
upon
his
guard
and
such
was
the
manner
in
which
he
performed
his
promise
february
sunday
during
my
former
visit
to
jamaica
i
had
interceded
in
behalf
of
a
negro
belonging
to
greenwich
estate
named
aberdeen
who
had
run
away
repeatedly
but
who
attributed
his
misconduct
to
the
decay
of
his
health
which
rendered
him
unable
to
work
as
well
as
formerly
and
to
the
fear
of
consequent
punishment
for
not
having
performed
the
tasks
assigned
to
him
the
fellow
while
he
spoke
to
me
had
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
looked
feeble
and
ill
and
indeed
seemed
to
be
quite
on
my
speaking
to
the
attorney
he
readily
promised
to
enquire
into
the
truth
of
the
man
s
statement
and
to
take
care
that
he
should
be
only
allotted
such
labour
as
his
strength
might
be
fully
equal
to
this
morning
he
came
over
to
see
me
and
so
altered
that
i
could
scarcely
believe
him
to
be
the
same
man
he
was
cleanly
dressed
walked
with
his
head
erect
and
his
eyes
sparkled
and
his
mouth
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
while
he
told
me
that
during
my
absence
every
thing
had
gone
well
with
him
nobody
had
put
upon
him
he
had
been
tasked
no
more
than
suited
his
strength
as
much
as
he
was
able
to
do
he
had
done
willingly
and
had
never
run
away
even
his
asthma
was
better
in
consequence
of
the
depression
being
removed
from
his
spirits
so
he
said
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
my
return
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
come
over
and
show
himself
to
me
and
tell
me
that
he
was
well
and
contented
and
behaving
properly
for
that
to
be
sure
if
massa
no
speak
that
good
word
for
me
to
trustee
me
no
livee
now
me
good
massa
gratitude
made
him
absolutely
eloquent
his
whole
manner
and
the
strong
expression
of
his
countenance
put
his
sincerity
out
of
all
doubt
and
i
never
saw
a
man
seem
to
feel
more
truly
thankful
all
negroes
therefore
are
not
absolutely
without
some
remembrance
of
kindness
shown
them
and
indeed
i
ought
not
in
justice
to
my
own
people
to
allow
myself
to
forget
that
when
i
sent
a
reward
to
those
who
had
roused
themselves
to
drive
the
cattle
out
of
my
canes
the
other
night
there
was
considerable
difficulty
in
persuading
them
to
accept
the
money
they
sent
me
word
that
as
they
were
all
well
treated
on
the
estate
it
was
their
business
to
take
care
that
no
mischief
was
done
to
it
and
that
they
did
not
deserve
to
be
rewarded
for
having
merely
done
their
duty
by
nor
was
it
till
after
they
had
received
repeated
orders
from
me
that
their
delicacy
could
be
overcome
and
themselves
persuaded
to
pocket
the
affront
and
the
february
one
of
the
deadliest
poisons
used
by
the
negroes
and
a
great
variety
is
perfectly
well
known
to
most
of
them
is
prepared
from
the
root
of
the
cassava
its
juice
being
expressed
and
allowed
to
ferment
a
small
worm
is
generated
the
substance
of
which
being
received
into
the
stomach
is
of
a
nature
the
most
pernicious
a
small
portion
of
this
worm
is
concealed
under
one
of
the
which
are
suffered
to
grow
long
for
this
purpose
then
when
the
negro
has
contrived
to
persuade
his
intended
victim
to
eat
or
drink
with
him
he
takes
an
opportunity
while
handing
to
him
a
dish
or
cup
to
let
the
worm
fall
which
never
fails
to
destroy
the
person
who
swallows
it
another
means
of
destruction
is
to
be
found
as
i
am
assured
in
almost
every
negro
garden
throughout
the
island
it
is
the
arsenic
bean
neither
useful
for
food
nor
ornamental
in
its
appearance
nor
can
the
negroes
when
questioned
give
any
reason
for
affording
it
a
place
in
their
gardens
yet
there
it
is
always
to
be
seen
the
alligator
s
liver
also
possesses
deleterious
properties
and
the
gall
is
said
to
be
still
more
dangerous
february
on
friday
i
was
made
to
observe
in
the
hospital
a
remarkably
fine
young
negro
about
years
of
age
stout
and
strong
and
whom
every
one
praised
for
his
numerous
good
qualities
and
particularly
for
his
affection
for
his
mother
and
the
services
which
he
rendered
her
he
complained
of
a
little
fever
and
a
slight
pain
in
his
side
on
saturday
he
left
the
hospital
and
intended
to
go
to
his
provision
grounds
among
the
mountains
on
sunday
morning
but
as
he
complained
of
a
pain
in
his
head
his
mother
prevented
his
going
and
obliged
him
to
return
to
the
hospital
in
the
evening
on
monday
he
was
seized
with
fainting
fits
lost
his
speech
and
power
of
motion
and
this
morning
i
was
awaked
by
the
shrieks
and
lamentations
of
the
poor
mother
who
on
coming
to
the
hospital
to
enquire
for
her
son
found
that
in
spite
of
all
possible
care
and
exertions
on
the
part
of
his
medical
attendants
he
had
just
expired
whether
it
be
the
climate
not
agreeing
with
their
african
blood
genuine
or
inherited
or
whether
it
be
from
some
defect
in
their
general
formation
certainly
negroes
seem
to
hold
their
lives
upon
a
very
precarious
tenure
nicholas
john
fuller
and
others
of
my
best
and
most
favoured
workmen
the
very
servants
too
in
my
own
house
are
perpetually
falling
ill
with
little
fevers
or
colds
or
pains
in
the
head
or
limbs
however
the
season
is
universally
allowed
to
have
been
peculiarly
unhealthy
for
negroes
and
indeed
even
for
white
people
the
deaths
on
board
the
shipping
having
been
unusually
numerous
this
year
as
to
the
barracks
which
are
scarcely
a
couple
of
miles
distant
from
my
estate
there
the
yellow
fever
has
established
itself
and
as
i
hear
is
committing
terrible
ravages
particularly
among
the
wives
of
the
this
morning
several
belonging
to
friendship
and
greenwich
came
to
complain
to
their
attorney
who
happened
to
be
at
my
house
that
the
overseer
obliged
them
to
wean
their
children
too
soon
some
of
these
children
were
above
months
old
and
none
under
eighteen
but
in
order
to
retain
the
leisure
and
other
indulgences
annexed
to
the
condition
of
the
female
negroes
by
their
own
would
never
wean
their
offspring
at
all
of
course
their
demands
were
rejected
and
they
went
home
in
high
discontent
one
of
them
indeed
not
scrupling
to
declare
aloud
and
with
a
peculiar
emphasis
and
manner
that
if
the
child
should
be
put
into
the
against
her
will
the
attorney
would
see
it
dead
in
less
than
a
week
february
the
violent
gale
of
wind
which
persecuted
us
with
so
much
pertinacity
on
our
leaving
the
english
channel
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
tail
of
a
tremendous
hurricane
which
has
utterly
laid
waste
barbados
and
several
other
islands
no
less
than
sixteen
of
the
ships
which
sailed
at
the
same
time
with
us
are
reported
to
have
perished
upon
the
passage
so
that
i
ought
to
consider
it
at
least
as
a
negative
piece
of
good
luck
to
have
reached
jamaica
myself
no
bones
broke
though
sore
peppered
but
i
am
still
trembling
in
uncertainty
for
the
fate
of
the
vessel
which
is
bringing
out
all
my
irish
supplies
and
the
of
which
would
be
a
misfortune
to
me
of
serious
magnitude
the
negroes
are
so
obstinate
and
so
wilful
in
their
general
character
that
if
they
do
not
receive
the
precise
articles
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
and
which
they
expect
as
their
right
no
compensation
however
ample
can
satisfy
them
thus
at
every
christmas
it
would
go
near
to
create
a
rebellion
if
they
did
not
receive
a
certain
proportion
of
salt
fish
but
if
in
the
intervening
months
accident
should
prevent
their
receiving
their
usual
allowance
of
herrings
the
giving
them
salt
fish
to
the
amount
of
double
the
value
would
be
considered
by
them
as
an
act
of
the
grossest
injustice
february
on
saturday
about
eight
in
the
evening
a
large
centipede
dropped
from
the
ceiling
upon
my
and
was
immediately
cut
in
two
exact
halves
by
one
of
the
guests
as
it
is
reported
in
jamaica
that
these
reptiles
when
thus
divided
will
again
or
if
separated
will
reproduce
their
missing
members
and
continue
to
live
as
stoutly
as
ever
i
put
both
parts
into
a
plate
under
a
glass
cover
on
sunday
they
continued
to
move
about
their
prison
with
considerable
agility
although
the
tail
was
evidently
much
more
lively
and
full
of
motion
than
the
head
perhaps
the
centipede
was
a
female
on
monday
the
head
was
dead
but
the
tail
continued
to
run
about
and
evidently
endeavoured
to
to
make
its
escape
although
it
appeared
not
to
know
very
well
how
to
set
about
it
nor
to
be
perfectly
determined
as
to
which
way
it
wanted
to
go
it
only
seemed
to
have
cymon
s
reason
for
wishing
to
take
a
walk
and
would
rather
go
any
where
than
stay
with
any
on
wednesday
at
twelve
o
clock
its
vivacity
was
a
little
abated
but
only
a
little
the
wound
was
skinned
over
and
i
was
waiting
anxiously
to
know
whether
it
would
subsist
without
its
numskull
till
a
good
old
age
or
would
put
forth
an
entirely
spick
and
span
new
head
and
shoulders
when
on
going
to
look
at
the
plate
on
thursday
morning
lo
and
behold
the
dead
head
and
the
living
tail
had
disappeared
together
i
suppose
some
of
the
negro
servants
had
thrown
them
away
through
ignorance
but
they
deny
one
and
all
having
so
much
as
touched
the
plate
most
stoutly
and
as
a
paper
case
pierced
in
several
places
had
been
substituted
for
the
glass
cover
some
persons
are
of
opinion
that
the
tail
made
its
escape
through
one
of
these
and
carried
its
head
away
with
it
in
its
forceps
be
this
as
it
may
gone
they
both
are
and
i
am
disappointed
beyond
measure
at
being
deprived
of
this
opportunity
of
reading
the
last
volume
of
the
life
and
adventures
of
a
centipede
s
i
have
proclaimed
a
reward
for
the
bringing
me
another
but
i
am
told
that
these
reptiles
are
only
found
by
accident
and
that
very
possibly
one
may
not
be
procured
previous
to
my
leaving
the
island
february
lutford
the
proprietor
of
a
considerable
estate
in
the
parish
of
clarendon
had
frequently
accused
a
particular
negro
of
purloining
coffee
about
six
months
ago
the
slave
was
sent
for
and
charged
with
a
fresh
offence
of
the
same
nature
when
he
confessed
the
having
taken
a
small
quantity
upon
which
his
master
ordered
him
to
fix
his
eyes
on
a
particular
cotton
tree
and
then
without
any
further
ceremony
shot
him
through
the
head
his
mistress
was
the
coroner
s
natural
daughter
and
the
coroner
himself
was
similarly
connected
with
the
custos
of
clarendon
in
consequence
of
this
family
compact
no
inquest
was
held
no
enquiry
was
made
the
whole
business
was
allowed
to
be
slurred
over
and
the
murder
would
have
remained
unpunished
if
accident
had
not
brought
some
rumours
respecting
it
to
the
governor
s
ear
an
investigation
was
ordered
to
take
place
without
delay
but
lutford
received
sufficient
warning
to
get
on
shipboard
and
escape
to
america
and
the
displacing
of
the
custos
of
clarendon
for
neglecting
his
official
duty
was
the
only
means
by
which
the
governor
could
express
his
abhorrence
of
the
act
february
sunday
my
estate
is
greatly
plagued
by
a
negress
named
catalina
she
is
either
mad
or
has
long
pretended
to
be
so
never
works
and
always
steals
about
a
week
before
my
arrival
she
was
found
in
the
which
she
had
pitched
upon
as
the
very
fittest
place
possible
for
her
kitchen
and
there
she
was
sitting
very
quietly
and
comfortably
boiling
her
pot
over
an
immense
fire
and
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
dry
canes
inflammable
as
tinder
this
vagary
was
of
too
dangerous
a
nature
to
allow
of
her
being
longer
left
at
liberty
and
she
was
put
into
the
hospital
but
her
husband
was
by
no
means
pleased
with
her
detention
as
he
never
failed
to
appropriate
to
himself
a
share
of
her
plunder
and
when
discovered
the
blame
of
the
robbery
was
laid
upon
his
wife
in
a
fit
of
insanity
so
while
the
general
joy
at
my
first
arrival
drew
the
hospital
attendants
from
their
post
he
took
the
opportunity
to
carry
off
his
wife
and
conceal
her
the
consequence
was
that
this
morning
complaints
poured
upon
me
of
gardens
robbed
by
catalina
who
had
carried
off
as
much
as
she
could
dug
up
and
destroyed
the
rest
and
had
shown
as
little
conscience
in
providing
herself
with
poultry
as
in
helping
herself
to
vegetables
i
immediately
despatched
one
of
the
with
a
party
in
pursuit
of
her
who
succeeded
in
lodging
her
once
more
in
the
hospital
where
she
must
remain
till
i
can
get
her
sent
to
the
asylum
at
kingston
the
only
hospital
for
lunatics
in
the
whole
island
february
thursday
on
my
former
visit
to
jamaica
i
found
on
my
estate
a
poor
woman
nearly
one
hundred
years
old
and
stone
blind
she
was
too
infirm
to
walk
but
two
young
negroes
brought
her
on
their
backs
to
the
steps
of
my
house
in
order
as
she
said
that
she
might
at
least
touch
massa
although
she
could
not
see
him
when
she
had
kissed
my
hand
that
was
enough
she
said
now
me
hab
once
kiss
a
massa
s
hand
me
willing
to
die
me
no
she
had
a
woman
appropriated
to
her
service
and
was
shown
the
greatest
care
and
attention
however
she
did
not
live
many
months
after
my
departure
there
was
also
a
mulatto
about
thirty
years
of
age
named
bob
who
had
been
almost
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
by
the
horrible
and
had
never
done
the
least
work
since
he
was
fifteen
he
was
so
gentle
and
humble
and
so
fearful
from
the
consciousness
of
his
total
inability
of
soliciting
my
notice
that
i
could
not
help
pitying
the
poor
fellow
and
whenever
he
came
in
my
way
i
always
sought
to
encourage
him
by
little
presents
and
other
trifling
marks
of
favour
his
thus
unexpectedly
meeting
with
distinguishing
kindness
where
he
expected
to
be
treated
as
a
worthless
incumbrance
made
a
strong
impression
on
his
mind
soon
after
my
departure
his
malady
assumed
a
more
active
appearance
but
during
the
last
stages
of
its
progress
the
only
fear
which
he
expressed
was
that
he
should
not
live
till
last
christmas
when
my
return
was
expected
to
a
certainty
in
the
mean
while
he
endeavoured
to
find
out
a
means
of
being
of
some
little
use
to
me
although
his
weak
constitution
would
not
allow
of
his
being
of
much
some
of
his
relations
being
in
opulent
circumstances
they
furnished
him
with
a
horse
for
he
was
too
weak
to
walk
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
mounted
upon
this
he
passed
all
his
time
in
traversing
the
estate
watching
the
corn
that
it
might
not
be
stolen
warning
the
if
any
of
the
cattle
had
found
their
way
into
the
and
doing
many
other
such
little
pieces
of
service
to
the
property
so
that
as
the
negroes
said
if
he
had
been
a
white
man
he
might
have
been
taken
for
an
at
length
christmas
arrived
it
was
known
that
i
was
on
the
sea
bob
too
was
still
alive
but
still
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
of
me
his
perpetual
question
to
all
who
came
to
visit
him
was
how
was
the
wind
and
he
was
constantly
praying
to
the
wind
and
the
ocean
to
bring
massa
s
vessel
soon
to
savanna
la
mar
that
he
might
but
see
him
once
more
and
thank
him
before
he
died
at
length
i
landed
and
when
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
on
my
estate
i
expressed
my
surprise
at
the
nonappearance
of
several
of
the
negroes
who
had
appeared
to
be
most
attached
to
me
and
i
had
expected
to
find
most
forward
in
greeting
me
i
was
told
that
a
messenger
had
been
sent
to
call
them
and
that
their
absence
was
occasioned
by
their
attendance
at
poor
bob
s
funeral
several
of
his
relations
who
nursed
him
on
his
have
assured
me
that
the
last
audible
words
which
he
uttered
were
are
there
still
no
news
of
massa
february
talk
of
lucretia
commend
me
to
a
the
hawk
of
jamaica
is
an
absolute
don
giovanni
and
he
never
loses
an
opportunity
of
being
extremely
rude
indeed
to
these
feathered
fair
ones
not
even
scrupling
to
use
the
last
violence
and
that
without
the
least
ceremony
not
so
much
as
saying
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
or
using
any
of
the
forms
which
common
civility
expects
upon
such
occasions
the
poor
timid
things
are
too
much
frightened
by
the
sudden
attack
of
this
tarquin
with
a
beak
and
claws
to
make
any
resistance
but
they
no
sooner
recover
from
their
flutter
sufficiently
to
be
aware
of
what
has
happened
than
they
feel
so
extremely
shocked
that
they
always
make
a
point
of
dying
nor
was
a
female
turkey
ever
known
to
survive
the
loss
of
her
honour
above
three
days
february
i
think
that
i
really
may
now
venture
to
hope
that
my
plans
for
the
management
of
my
estate
have
succeeded
beyond
even
my
most
sanguine
expectations
i
have
now
passed
three
weeks
with
my
negroes
the
doors
of
my
house
open
all
day
long
and
full
liberty
allowed
to
every
person
to
come
and
speak
to
me
without
witnesses
or
restraint
yet
not
one
man
or
woman
has
come
to
me
with
a
single
complaint
on
the
contrary
all
my
enquiries
have
been
answered
by
an
assurance
that
during
the
two
years
of
my
absence
my
regulations
were
adhered
to
most
implicitly
and
that
except
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
massa
there
was
no
more
difference
in
treatment
than
if
i
had
remained
upon
the
estate
many
of
them
have
come
to
tell
me
instances
of
kindness
which
they
have
received
from
one
or
other
of
their
superintendents
others
to
describe
some
severe
fit
of
illness
in
which
they
must
have
died
but
for
the
care
taken
of
them
in
the
hospital
some
who
were
weakly
and
on
my
former
visit
to
show
me
how
much
they
are
improved
in
health
and
tell
me
how
they
keep
up
heart
now
because
since
massa
come
upon
the
property
nobody
put
upon
them
and
all
go
well
and
some
who
had
formerly
complained
of
one
trifle
or
other
to
take
back
their
complaints
and
say
that
they
wanted
no
change
and
were
willing
to
be
employed
in
any
way
that
might
be
thought
most
for
the
good
of
the
estate
but
although
i
have
now
at
least
every
one
of
them
and
have
conversed
with
numbers
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
find
one
person
who
had
so
much
as
even
an
imaginary
grievance
to
lay
before
me
yet
i
find
that
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
punish
with
the
lash
although
only
in
a
very
few
instances
but
then
this
only
took
place
on
the
commission
of
absolute
and
in
cases
where
its
necessity
and
justice
were
so
universally
felt
not
only
by
others
but
by
the
sufferers
themselves
that
instead
of
complaining
they
seem
only
to
be
afraid
of
their
offence
coming
to
my
knowledge
to
prevent
which
they
affect
to
be
more
satisfied
and
happy
than
all
the
rest
and
now
when
i
see
a
mouth
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
with
a
more
than
ordinary
expansion
of
jaw
i
never
fail
to
find
on
enquiry
that
its
proprietor
is
one
of
those
who
have
been
punished
during
my
absence
i
then
take
care
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
making
a
complaint
if
they
should
have
any
to
make
but
no
not
a
word
comes
every
thing
has
gone
on
perfectly
well
and
just
as
it
ought
to
have
upon
this
i
drop
a
slight
hint
of
the
offence
in
question
and
instantly
away
goes
the
grin
and
down
falls
the
negro
to
kiss
my
feet
confess
his
fault
and
beg
massa
forgib
and
them
never
do
so
bad
thing
more
to
fret
massa
and
them
beg
massa
pardon
hard
quite
hard
but
not
one
of
them
has
denied
the
justice
of
his
punishment
or
complained
of
undue
severity
on
the
part
of
his
superintendents
on
the
other
hand
although
the
lash
has
thus
been
in
a
manner
utterly
abolished
except
in
cases
where
a
much
severer
punishment
would
have
been
inflicted
by
the
police
and
although
they
are
aware
of
this
unwillingness
to
chastise
my
trustee
acknowledges
that
during
my
absence
the
negroes
have
been
quiet
and
tractable
and
have
not
only
laboured
as
well
as
they
used
to
do
but
have
done
much
more
work
than
the
negroes
on
an
adjoining
property
where
there
are
forty
more
negroes
and
where
moreover
a
considerable
sum
is
paid
for
hired
assistance
having
now
waited
three
weeks
to
see
how
they
would
conduct
themselves
and
found
no
cause
of
dissatisfaction
since
the
neglect
of
the
watchman
to
guard
the
cattle
and
which
they
one
and
all
attributed
to
their
joy
at
seeing
me
again
i
thought
it
time
to
distribute
the
presents
which
i
had
brought
with
me
for
them
from
england
during
my
absence
i
had
ordered
a
new
and
additional
hospital
to
be
built
intended
entirely
for
the
use
of
women
nursing
mothers
and
cases
of
a
serious
nature
for
which
purpose
it
is
to
be
provided
with
every
possible
comfort
while
the
old
hospital
is
to
be
reserved
for
those
who
have
little
or
nothing
the
matter
with
them
but
who
obstinately
insist
upon
their
being
too
ill
to
work
in
defiance
of
the
opinion
of
all
their
medical
attendants
the
new
hospital
is
not
quite
finished
but
wishing
to
connect
it
as
much
as
possible
with
pleasurable
associations
i
took
occasion
of
the
distribution
of
presents
to
open
it
for
the
first
time
accordingly
the
negroes
were
summoned
to
the
new
hospital
this
morning
the
rooms
were
sprinkled
with
madeira
for
good
luck
and
the
toast
of
health
to
the
new
hospital
and
shame
to
the
old
lazy
house
was
drunk
by
the
trustee
the
doctoresses
the
governors
and
received
by
the
whole
congregation
of
negroes
with
loud
cheering
after
which
every
man
received
a
blue
jacket
lined
with
flannel
every
woman
a
flaming
red
stuff
petticoat
and
every
child
a
frock
of
white
cotton
they
then
fell
to
dancing
and
singing
and
drinking
rum
and
sugar
which
they
kept
up
till
a
much
later
hour
than
would
be
at
all
approved
of
by
the
bench
of
bishops
for
it
is
now
sunday
morning
and
they
are
still
dancing
and
singing
louder
than
ever
february
sunday
divine
service
was
performed
at
savanna
la
mar
for
the
first
time
these
five
weeks
the
rector
has
been
indisposed
lately
with
the
lumbago
he
has
no
curate
and
thus
during
five
whole
weeks
there
was
a
total
cessation
of
public
worship
i
had
told
several
of
my
female
acquaintance
that
it
was
long
since
they
had
been
to
church
that
i
was
afraid
of
their
forgetting
all
about
and
about
it
and
that
if
there
should
be
no
service
for
a
week
longer
i
should
think
it
my
duty
to
come
and
hear
them
say
their
catechism
myself
luckily
the
rector
recovered
and
saved
me
the
trouble
of
hearing
them
but
the
long
privation
of
public
prayer
did
not
seem
to
have
created
any
very
great
demand
for
the
article
as
i
have
seldom
witnessed
a
more
meagre
congregation
it
was
literally
two
or
three
gathered
together
and
it
seemed
as
if
five
or
six
would
be
too
many
and
forfeit
the
promise
i
can
not
discover
that
the
negroes
have
any
external
forms
of
worship
nor
any
priests
in
jamaica
unless
their
obeah
men
should
be
considered
as
such
but
still
i
can
not
think
that
they
ought
to
be
considered
as
totally
devoid
of
all
natural
religion
there
is
no
phrase
so
common
on
their
lips
as
god
bless
you
and
god
preserve
you
and
god
will
bless
you
wherever
you
go
phrases
which
they
pronounce
with
of
sincerity
and
as
if
they
came
from
the
very
bottom
of
their
hearts
mity
mity
is
their
constant
exclamation
in
pain
and
in
sorrow
and
with
this
perpetual
recurrence
to
the
supreme
being
it
must
be
difficult
to
insist
upon
their
being
atheists
but
they
have
even
got
a
step
further
than
the
belief
in
a
god
they
also
allow
the
existence
of
an
evil
principle
one
of
them
complained
to
me
the
other
day
that
when
he
went
to
the
field
his
companions
had
told
him
that
he
might
go
to
hell
for
he
was
not
worthy
to
work
with
them
and
one
of
his
adversaries
in
return
accused
him
of
being
so
lazy
that
instead
of
being
a
slave
upon
cornwall
estate
he
was
only
fit
to
be
the
slave
of
the
then
surely
they
could
not
be
afraid
of
duppies
or
ghosts
without
some
idea
of
a
future
state
and
indeed
nothing
is
more
firmly
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
the
africans
than
that
after
death
they
shall
go
back
to
africa
and
pass
an
eternity
in
revelling
and
feasting
with
their
ancestors
the
proprietor
of
a
neighbouring
estate
lately
used
all
his
influence
to
persuade
his
to
be
christened
but
it
was
all
in
vain
she
had
imbibed
strong
african
prejudices
from
her
mother
and
frankly
declared
that
she
found
nothing
in
the
christian
system
so
alluring
to
her
taste
as
the
balls
and
banquets
promised
by
the
religion
of
africa
i
confess
that
this
prejudice
appears
to
me
to
be
so
strongly
rooted
that
in
spite
of
the
curates
expected
from
the
hands
of
the
bishop
of
london
i
am
sadly
afraid
that
the
pulpit
drum
ecclesiastic
will
find
it
a
hard
matter
to
overpower
the
gumby
and
that
the
joys
of
the
christian
paradise
will
be
seen
to
kick
the
beam
when
they
are
weighed
against
the
pleasures
of
eating
fat
hog
drinking
raw
rum
and
dancing
for
centuries
to
the
and
in
the
negro
festivals
in
this
life
the
chief
point
lies
in
making
as
much
noise
as
possible
and
the
africans
and
creoles
dispute
it
with
the
greatest
pertinacity
i
am
just
informed
that
at
the
dance
last
night
the
eboes
obtained
a
decided
triumph
for
they
roared
and
screamed
and
shouted
and
thumped
their
drums
with
so
much
effect
that
the
creoles
were
fairly
rendered
deaf
with
the
noise
of
their
rivals
and
dumb
with
their
own
and
obliged
to
leave
off
singing
altogether
february
on
my
arrival
i
found
that
idle
rogue
nato
as
usual
an
inmate
of
the
hospital
where
he
regularly
passes
at
least
nine
months
out
of
the
twelve
he
was
with
infinite
difficulty
persuaded
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
to
employ
himself
about
the
for
a
couple
of
days
but
on
the
third
he
returned
to
the
hospital
although
the
medical
attendants
one
and
all
declared
nothing
to
be
the
matter
with
him
and
the
doctors
even
refused
to
insert
his
name
in
the
sick
list
still
he
persisted
in
declaring
himself
to
be
too
ill
to
do
a
single
stroke
of
work
so
on
thursday
i
put
him
into
one
of
the
sick
rooms
by
himself
and
desired
him
to
get
well
with
the
doors
locked
which
he
would
find
to
the
full
as
easy
as
with
the
doors
open
at
the
same
time
assuring
him
that
he
should
never
come
out
till
he
should
be
sufficiently
recovered
to
cut
canes
in
the
field
he
held
good
all
friday
but
saturday
being
a
he
declared
himself
to
be
in
a
perfect
state
of
health
and
desired
to
be
released
however
i
was
determined
to
make
him
suffer
a
little
for
his
lying
and
obstinacy
and
would
not
suffer
the
doors
to
be
opened
for
him
till
this
morning
when
he
quitted
the
hospital
saluted
on
all
sides
by
loud
huzzas
in
congratulation
of
his
amended
health
and
which
followed
him
during
his
whole
progress
to
the
i
was
informed
that
a
lad
named
epsom
who
used
to
be
perpetually
running
away
had
been
stationary
for
the
last
two
years
so
on
wednesday
last
as
he
happened
to
come
in
my
way
i
gave
him
all
proper
commendation
for
having
got
rid
of
his
bad
habits
and
to
make
the
praise
better
worth
his
having
i
added
a
maccarony
he
was
gratified
in
the
extreme
thanked
me
a
thousand
times
promised
most
solemnly
never
to
behave
ill
again
and
ran
away
that
very
night
however
he
returned
on
saturday
morning
and
was
brought
to
me
all
rags
tears
and
penitence
wondering
how
he
could
have
had
such
as
to
make
massa
february
some
of
the
free
people
of
colour
possess
slaves
cattle
and
other
property
left
them
by
their
fathers
and
are
in
good
circumstances
but
few
of
them
are
industrious
enough
to
increase
their
possessions
by
any
honest
exertions
of
their
own
as
to
the
free
blacks
they
are
almost
uniformly
lazy
and
improvident
most
of
them
and
only
anxious
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
some
lounge
about
the
highways
with
stocked
with
various
worthless
baubles
others
keep
miserable
stalls
provided
with
rancid
butter
damaged
and
other
such
articles
and
these
they
are
always
willing
to
exchange
for
stolen
rum
and
sugar
which
they
secretly
tempt
the
negroes
to
pilfer
from
their
proprietors
but
few
of
them
ever
make
the
exertion
of
earning
their
livelihood
creditably
even
those
who
profess
to
be
tailors
carpenters
or
coopers
are
for
the
most
part
careless
drunken
and
dissipated
and
never
take
pains
sufficient
to
attain
any
dexterity
in
their
trade
as
to
a
free
negro
hiring
himself
out
for
plantation
labour
no
instance
of
such
a
thing
was
ever
known
in
jamaica
and
probably
no
price
however
great
would
be
considered
by
them
as
a
sufficient
temptation
february
the
africans
and
creoles
certainly
do
hate
each
other
with
a
cordiality
which
would
have
appeared
highly
gratifying
to
johnson
in
his
love
of
good
yesterday
in
the
field
a
girl
who
had
taken
some
slight
offence
at
something
said
to
her
by
a
young
boy
immediately
struck
him
with
the
bill
with
which
she
was
cutting
canes
luckily
his
loose
wrapper
saved
him
from
the
blow
and
on
his
running
away
she
threw
the
bill
after
him
in
his
flight
with
all
the
fury
and
malice
of
a
fiend
this
same
vixen
during
my
former
visit
had
been
punished
for
fixing
her
teeth
in
the
hand
of
one
of
the
other
girls
and
nearly
biting
her
thumb
off
and
on
hearing
of
this
fresh
instance
of
devilism
i
asked
her
mother
how
she
came
to
have
so
bad
a
daughter
when
all
her
sons
were
so
mild
and
good
oh
massa
answered
she
the
girl
s
father
was
a
february
neptune
came
this
morning
to
request
that
the
name
of
his
son
oscar
might
be
changed
for
that
of
julius
which
it
seems
had
been
that
of
his
own
father
the
child
he
said
had
always
been
weakly
and
he
was
persuaded
that
its
proceeded
from
his
deceased
grandfather
s
being
displeased
because
it
had
not
been
called
after
him
the
other
day
too
a
woman
who
had
a
child
sick
in
the
hospital
begged
me
to
change
its
name
for
any
other
which
might
please
me
best
she
cared
not
what
but
she
was
sure
that
it
would
never
do
well
so
long
as
it
should
be
called
lucia
perhaps
this
prejudice
respecting
the
power
of
names
produces
in
some
measure
their
unwillingness
to
be
christened
they
find
no
change
produced
in
them
except
the
alteration
of
their
name
and
hence
they
conclude
that
this
name
contains
in
it
some
secret
power
while
on
the
other
hand
they
conceive
that
the
ghosts
of
their
ancestors
can
not
fail
to
be
offended
at
their
abandoning
an
appellation
either
hereditary
in
the
family
or
given
by
themselves
it
is
another
that
the
eructation
of
the
breath
of
a
sucking
child
has
something
in
it
venomous
and
frequently
nursing
mothers
on
showing
the
doctor
a
swelled
breast
will
very
gravely
and
positively
attribute
it
to
the
infant
s
having
broken
wind
while
hanging
at
the
nipple
february
i
asked
one
of
my
negro
servants
this
morning
whether
old
luke
was
a
relation
of
his
yes
he
is
he
your
uncle
or
your
cousin
no
what
then
he
and
my
father
were
shipmates
february
the
in
jamaica
have
lately
been
regulated
by
the
house
of
assembly
and
by
all
accounts
except
that
of
the
lawyers
it
was
full
time
that
something
should
be
done
on
the
subject
a
case
was
mentioned
to
me
this
morning
of
an
estate
litigated
between
several
parties
at
length
a
decision
was
given
the
estate
was
sold
for
but
the
lawyer
s
claim
must
always
be
the
first
discharged
and
as
this
amounted
to
more
than
the
lawyer
found
himself
in
possession
of
the
estate
this
was
the
fable
of
æsop
s
oyster
put
in
action
with
a
vengeance
february
a
negro
named
adam
has
long
been
the
terror
of
my
whole
estate
he
was
accused
of
being
an
and
persons
notorious
for
the
practice
of
obeah
had
been
found
concealed
from
justice
in
his
house
who
were
afterwards
convicted
and
transported
he
was
strongly
suspected
of
having
poisoned
more
than
twelve
negroes
men
and
women
and
having
been
displaced
by
my
former
trustee
from
being
principal
governor
in
revenge
he
put
poison
into
his
water
jar
luckily
he
was
observed
by
one
of
the
house
servants
who
impeached
him
and
prevented
the
intended
mischief
for
this
offence
he
ought
to
have
been
given
up
to
justice
but
being
brother
of
the
trustee
s
mistress
she
found
means
to
get
him
off
after
undergoing
a
long
confinement
in
the
stocks
i
found
him
on
my
arrival
living
in
a
state
of
utter
excommunication
i
tried
what
reasoning
with
him
could
effect
reconciled
him
to
his
companions
treated
him
with
marked
kindness
and
he
promised
solemnly
to
behave
well
during
my
absence
however
instead
of
attributing
my
lenity
to
a
wish
to
reform
him
his
pride
and
confidence
in
his
own
talents
and
powers
of
deception
made
him
attribute
the
indulgence
shown
him
to
his
having
obtained
an
influence
over
my
mind
this
he
determined
to
employ
to
his
own
purposes
upon
my
return
so
he
set
about
forming
a
conspiracy
against
sully
the
present
chief
governor
and
boasted
on
various
estates
in
the
neighbourhood
that
on
my
arrival
he
would
take
care
to
get
sully
broke
and
himself
substituted
in
his
place
in
the
meanwhile
he
quarrelled
and
fought
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
on
my
arrival
i
found
the
whole
estate
in
an
uproar
about
adam
no
less
than
three
charges
of
assault
with
intent
to
kill
were
preferred
against
him
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
he
had
endeavoured
to
strangle
marlborough
with
the
thong
of
a
whip
and
had
nearly
effected
his
purpose
before
he
could
be
dragged
away
he
had
knocked
nato
down
in
some
trifling
dispute
and
while
the
man
was
senseless
had
thrown
him
into
the
river
to
drown
him
and
having
taken
offence
at
a
poor
weak
creature
called
old
rachael
on
meeting
her
by
accident
he
struck
her
to
the
ground
beat
her
with
a
supplejack
stamped
upon
her
belly
and
begged
her
to
be
assured
of
his
intention
as
he
eloquently
worded
it
to
kick
her
guts
the
breeding
mothers
also
accused
him
of
having
been
the
cause
of
the
poisoning
a
particular
spring
from
which
they
were
in
the
habit
of
fetching
water
for
their
children
as
adam
on
that
morning
had
been
seen
near
the
spring
without
having
any
business
there
and
he
had
been
heard
to
caution
his
little
daughter
against
drinking
water
from
it
that
day
although
he
stoutly
denied
both
circumstances
into
the
bargain
my
head
blacksmith
being
perfectly
well
at
five
o
clock
was
found
by
his
son
dead
in
his
bed
at
eight
and
it
was
known
that
he
had
lately
had
a
dispute
with
adam
who
on
that
day
had
made
it
up
with
him
and
had
invited
him
to
drink
although
it
was
not
certain
that
his
offer
had
been
accepted
he
had
moreover
threatened
the
lives
of
many
of
the
best
negroes
two
of
the
cooks
declared
that
he
had
severally
directed
them
to
dress
sully
s
food
apart
and
had
given
them
powders
to
mix
with
it
the
first
to
whom
he
applied
refused
positively
the
second
he
treated
with
liquor
and
when
she
had
drunk
he
gave
her
the
poison
with
instructions
how
to
use
it
being
a
timid
creature
she
did
not
dare
to
object
so
threw
away
the
powder
privately
and
pretended
that
it
had
been
administered
but
finding
no
effect
produced
by
it
adam
gave
her
a
second
powder
at
the
same
time
bidding
her
remember
the
liquor
which
she
had
swallowed
and
which
he
assured
her
would
effect
her
own
destruction
through
the
force
of
obeah
unless
she
prevented
it
by
sacrificing
his
enemy
in
her
stead
the
poor
creature
still
threw
away
the
powder
but
the
strength
of
imagination
brought
upon
her
a
serious
malady
and
it
was
not
till
after
several
weeks
that
she
recovered
from
the
effects
of
her
fears
the
terror
thus
produced
was
universal
throughout
the
estate
and
sully
and
several
other
principal
negroes
requested
me
to
remove
them
to
my
property
in
thomas
s
as
their
lives
were
not
safe
while
breathing
the
same
air
with
adam
however
it
appeared
a
more
salutary
measure
to
remove
adam
himself
but
all
the
poisoning
charges
either
went
no
further
than
strong
suspicion
or
any
more
than
the
assaults
were
not
liable
by
the
laws
of
jamaica
to
be
punished
except
by
flogging
or
temporary
imprisonment
which
would
only
have
returned
him
to
the
estate
with
increased
resentment
against
those
to
whom
he
should
ascribe
his
sufferings
however
deserved
however
on
searching
his
house
a
musket
with
a
plentiful
accompaniment
of
powder
and
ball
was
found
concealed
as
also
a
considerable
quantity
of
materials
for
the
practice
of
obeah
the
possession
of
either
of
the
above
articles
if
the
musket
is
without
the
consent
of
the
proprietor
authorises
the
magistrates
to
pronounce
a
sentence
of
transportation
in
consequence
of
this
discovery
adam
was
immediately
committed
to
gaol
a
slave
court
was
summoned
and
a
sentence
of
transportation
from
the
island
was
pronounced
after
a
trial
of
three
hours
as
to
the
man
s
guilt
of
that
the
jury
entertained
no
doubt
after
the
first
half
hour
s
evidence
and
the
only
difficulty
was
to
restrain
the
verdict
to
transportation
we
produced
nothing
which
could
possibly
affect
the
man
s
life
for
although
perhaps
no
offender
ever
better
de
served
hanging
yet
i
confess
my
being
enough
to
entertain
doubts
whether
hanging
or
other
capital
punishment
ought
to
be
inflicted
for
any
offence
whatever
i
am
at
least
certain
that
if
offenders
waited
till
they
were
hanged
by
me
they
would
remain
unhanged
till
they
were
all
so
many
old
parrs
however
although
i
did
my
best
to
prevent
adam
from
being
hanged
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
prevent
his
hanging
himself
the
obeah
ceremonies
always
commence
with
what
is
called
by
the
negroes
the
myal
this
is
intended
to
remove
any
doubt
of
the
chief
s
supernatural
powers
and
in
the
course
of
it
he
undertakes
to
show
his
art
by
killing
one
of
the
persons
present
whom
he
pitches
upon
for
that
purpose
he
sprinkles
various
powders
over
the
devoted
victim
blows
upon
him
and
dances
round
him
obliges
him
to
drink
a
liquor
prepared
for
the
occasion
and
finally
the
sorcerer
and
his
assistants
seize
him
and
whirl
him
rapidly
round
and
round
till
the
man
loses
his
senses
and
falls
on
the
ground
to
all
appearance
and
the
belief
of
the
spectators
a
perfect
corpse
the
chief
then
utters
loud
shrieks
rushes
out
of
the
house
with
wild
and
frantic
gestures
and
conceals
himself
in
some
neighbouring
wood
at
the
end
of
two
or
three
hours
he
returns
with
a
large
bundle
of
herbs
from
some
of
which
he
squeezes
the
juice
into
the
mouth
of
the
dead
person
with
others
he
anoints
his
eyes
and
stains
the
tips
of
his
fingers
accompanying
the
ceremony
with
a
great
variety
of
grotesque
actions
and
chanting
all
the
while
something
between
a
song
and
a
howl
while
the
assistants
hand
in
hand
dance
slowly
round
them
in
a
circle
stamping
the
ground
loudly
with
their
feet
to
keep
time
with
his
chant
a
considerable
time
elapses
before
the
desired
effect
is
produced
but
at
length
the
corpse
gradually
recovers
animation
rises
from
the
ground
perfectly
recovered
and
the
myal
dance
concludes
after
this
proof
of
his
power
those
who
wish
to
be
revenged
upon
their
enemies
apply
to
the
sorcerer
for
some
of
the
same
powder
which
produced
apparent
death
upon
their
companion
and
as
they
never
employ
the
means
used
for
his
recovery
of
course
the
powder
once
administered
never
fails
to
be
lastingly
fatal
it
must
be
superfluous
to
mention
that
the
on
this
second
occasion
substitutes
a
poison
for
a
narcotic
now
among
other
suspicious
articles
found
in
adam
s
hut
there
was
a
string
of
beads
of
various
sizes
shapes
and
colours
arranged
in
a
form
peculiar
to
the
performance
of
the
in
the
myal
dance
their
use
was
so
well
known
that
adam
on
his
trial
did
not
even
attempt
to
deny
that
they
could
serve
for
no
purpose
but
the
practice
of
obeah
but
he
endeavoured
to
refute
their
being
his
own
property
and
with
this
view
he
began
to
narrate
the
means
by
which
he
had
become
possessed
of
them
he
said
that
they
belonged
to
fox
a
negro
who
was
lately
transported
from
whom
he
had
taken
them
at
a
myal
dance
held
on
the
estate
of
dean
s
valley
but
as
the
assistants
at
one
of
these
dances
are
by
law
condemned
to
death
equally
with
the
principal
performer
the
court
had
the
humanity
to
interrupt
his
confession
of
having
been
present
on
such
an
occasion
and
thus
saved
him
from
criminating
himself
so
deeply
as
to
render
a
capital
punishment
inevitable
i
understand
that
he
was
quite
unabashed
and
at
his
ease
the
whole
time
upon
hearing
his
sentence
he
only
said
very
coolly
well
i
ca
n
t
help
it
turned
himself
round
and
walked
out
of
court
that
nothing
might
be
wanting
this
fellow
had
even
a
decided
talent
for
hypocrisy
when
on
my
arrival
he
gave
me
a
letter
filled
with
the
grossest
lies
respecting
the
trustee
and
every
creditable
negro
on
the
estate
he
took
care
to
sign
it
by
the
name
which
he
had
lately
received
in
baptism
and
in
his
defence
at
the
bar
to
prove
his
probity
of
character
and
purity
of
manners
he
informed
the
court
that
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
learning
to
read
for
the
sole
purpose
of
learning
the
lord
s
prayer
the
by
which
he
was
generally
known
among
the
negroes
in
this
part
of
the
country
was
buonaparte
and
he
always
appeared
to
exult
in
the
appellation
once
condemned
the
marshal
is
bound
under
a
heavy
penalty
to
see
him
shipped
from
off
the
island
before
the
expiration
of
six
weeks
and
probably
he
will
be
sent
to
cuba
he
is
a
man
between
thirty
and
forty
square
built
and
of
great
bodily
strength
and
his
countenance
equally
expresses
intelligence
and
malignity
the
sum
allowed
me
for
him
is
one
hundred
pounds
currency
which
is
scarcely
a
third
of
his
worth
as
a
labourer
but
which
is
the
highest
value
which
a
jury
is
permitted
to
mention
march
sunday
last
night
the
negroes
of
friendship
took
it
into
their
ingenious
heads
to
pay
me
a
compliment
of
an
extremely
inconvenient
nature
they
thought
that
it
would
be
highly
proper
to
treat
me
with
a
nightly
serenade
just
by
way
of
showing
their
on
my
return
and
accordingly
a
large
body
of
them
arrived
at
my
doors
about
midnight
dressed
out
in
their
best
clothes
and
accompanied
with
drums
rattles
and
their
whole
orchestra
of
abominable
instruments
determined
to
pass
the
whole
night
in
singing
and
dancing
under
my
windows
luckily
my
heard
what
was
going
forwards
and
knowing
my
taste
a
little
better
than
my
visiters
they
hastened
to
assure
them
of
my
being
in
bed
and
asleep
and
with
much
difficulty
persuaded
them
to
remove
into
my
village
here
they
contented
themselves
with
making
a
noise
for
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
and
the
next
morning
after
coming
up
to
see
me
at
breakfast
they
went
away
quietly
one
of
them
only
remained
to
enquire
particularly
after
lady
h
as
her
mother
had
been
her
nurse
and
she
was
very
particular
in
her
enquiries
as
to
her
health
her
children
their
ages
and
names
when
she
went
away
i
gave
her
a
plentiful
provision
of
bread
butter
plantains
and
cold
ham
from
the
breakfast
table
part
of
which
she
sat
down
to
eat
intending
as
she
said
to
carry
the
rest
to
her
piccaninny
at
home
but
in
half
an
hour
after
she
made
her
appearance
again
saying
she
was
come
to
take
leave
of
me
and
hoped
i
would
give
her
a
to
buy
tobacco
i
gave
her
a
maccaroni
which
occasioned
a
great
squall
of
delight
oh
since
i
had
given
her
so
much
she
would
not
buy
tobacco
but
a
fowl
and
then
when
i
returned
she
would
bring
me
a
chicken
from
it
for
my
dinner
that
is
if
she
could
keep
the
other
negroes
from
stealing
it
from
her
a
piece
of
extraordinary
good
luck
of
which
she
seemed
to
entertain
but
slender
hopes
at
length
off
she
set
but
she
had
scarcely
gone
above
ten
yards
from
the
house
when
she
turned
back
and
was
soon
at
my
once
more
with
a
well
here
me
come
to
massa
again
so
then
she
said
that
she
had
meant
to
eat
part
of
the
provisions
which
i
had
given
her
and
carry
home
the
rest
to
her
boy
but
that
really
it
was
so
good
she
could
not
help
going
on
eating
and
eating
till
she
had
eaten
the
whole
and
now
she
wanted
another
bit
of
cold
ham
to
carry
home
to
her
child
and
then
she
should
go
away
perfectly
contented
i
ordered
cubina
to
give
her
a
great
hunch
of
it
and
phillis
at
length
took
her
departure
for
good
and
all
march
wednesday
i
set
out
to
visit
my
estate
in
thomas
s
in
the
east
called
hordley
it
is
at
the
very
furthest
extremity
of
the
island
and
never
was
there
a
journey
like
unto
my
journey
something
disagreeable
happened
at
every
step
my
accidents
commenced
before
i
had
accomplished
ten
miles
from
my
own
house
for
in
passing
along
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
which
overhangs
the
sea
near
bluefields
a
pair
of
young
in
my
carriage
took
fright
at
the
roaring
of
the
waves
which
dashed
violently
against
them
and
twice
nearly
overturned
me
on
the
second
occasion
one
of
them
actually
fell
down
into
the
water
while
the
of
the
curricle
flew
up
into
the
air
and
thus
it
remained
suspended
balancing
backwards
and
forwards
like
mahomet
s
coffin
luckily
time
was
allowed
the
horse
to
recover
his
legs
down
came
the
wheel
once
more
on
terra
firma
and
on
we
went
again
we
slept
at
cashew
an
estate
near
lacovia
and
the
next
morning
at
daylight
proceeded
to
climb
the
bogr
a
mountain
so
difficult
that
every
one
had
pronounced
the
attempt
to
be
hopeless
with
horses
so
young
as
mine
but
those
horses
were
my
only
ones
and
therefore
i
was
obliged
to
make
the
trial
the
road
is
bordered
by
tremendous
precipices
for
about
twelve
miles
the
path
is
so
narrow
that
a
servant
must
always
be
sent
on
before
to
make
any
carts
which
may
be
descending
stop
in
recesses
hollowed
out
for
this
express
purpose
and
the
cartmen
are
obliged
to
sound
their
shells
repeatedly
in
order
to
give
each
other
timely
warning
the
chief
danger
however
proceeds
from
the
steepness
of
the
road
which
in
some
places
will
not
permit
the
waggons
to
stop
however
well
their
conductors
may
be
inclined
then
down
they
come
drawn
by
twelve
or
fourteen
or
sometimes
sixteen
oxen
sweeping
every
thing
before
them
and
any
carriage
unlucky
enough
to
find
itself
in
their
course
must
infallibly
be
dashed
over
the
precipice
it
really
appeared
as
if
all
the
estates
in
the
island
had
agreed
to
send
their
produce
by
this
particular
road
the
shells
formed
a
complete
chorus
and
sounded
incessantly
during
our
whole
passage
of
the
mountain
and
at
one
time
there
was
a
very
numerous
accumulation
of
carts
and
oxen
in
consequence
of
my
carriage
coming
to
a
complete
stop
as
we
were
ascending
it
is
very
well
said
a
gentleman
who
was
travelling
with
me
hill
that
we
did
not
come
by
this
road
three
months
sooner
i
remember
about
that
time
travelling
it
on
horseback
and
an
enormous
tree
had
fallen
over
the
path
which
made
me
say
to
myself
as
i
passed
under
it
now
how
would
a
chaise
with
a
canopy
get
along
here
the
tree
hangs
so
low
that
the
carriage
never
could
pass
and
it
would
certainly
have
to
go
all
the
way
home
of
course
the
obstacle
must
now
be
removed
but
if
i
remember
right
this
must
have
been
the
very
spot
and
as
i
hope
to
live
yonder
is
the
very
tree
still
and
so
it
proved
although
three
months
had
elapsed
the
impediment
had
been
suffered
to
remain
in
unmolested
possession
of
the
road
and
to
pass
my
carriage
under
it
proved
an
absolute
impossibility
after
much
discussion
and
many
fruitless
attempts
we
at
length
succeeded
in
unscrewing
the
wheels
lifting
off
the
body
which
we
carried
along
and
then
built
the
curricle
up
again
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
tree
however
by
one
means
or
other
after
leaving
a
at
a
coffee
plantation
to
the
owner
of
which
i
was
a
perfect
stranger
but
who
very
obligingly
offered
to
take
charge
of
the
animal
we
found
ourselves
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
but
the
fatal
tree
and
the
delay
occasioned
by
taking
unavoidable
shelter
from
tremendous
storms
of
rain
had
lost
us
so
much
time
that
night
surprised
us
when
we
were
still
eight
miles
distant
from
our
destined
inn
the
night
was
dark
as
night
could
be
no
moon
no
stars
nor
any
light
except
the
flashing
of
myriads
of
which
flapping
in
the
faces
of
the
young
horses
frightened
them
and
made
them
rear
the
road
too
was
full
of
precipices
and
deep
and
dangerous
holes
as
to
the
ground
it
was
quite
invisible
and
we
had
no
means
of
proceeding
with
any
chance
of
safety
except
by
making
some
of
the
servants
lead
the
horses
while
others
went
before
us
to
explore
the
way
while
they
cried
out
at
every
moment
take
care
a
little
to
the
left
or
you
will
slip
into
that
a
little
to
the
right
or
you
will
tumble
over
that
into
the
bargain
there
was
neither
inn
nor
gentleman
s
house
within
reach
and
thus
we
proceeded
crawling
along
at
a
foot
s
pace
for
five
eternal
miles
when
we
at
length
stopped
to
beg
a
shelter
for
the
night
at
a
small
estate
called
porous
by
this
time
it
was
midnight
all
the
family
was
gone
to
bed
the
gates
were
all
locked
and
before
we
could
obtain
admittance
a
full
hour
elapsed
during
which
i
sat
in
an
open
carriage
perspiration
streaming
down
from
my
head
to
my
feet
through
vexation
impatience
and
fatigue
while
the
fell
heavy
and
the
blew
keen
which
as
i
had
frequently
been
assured
was
the
very
best
recipe
possible
for
getting
a
jamaica
fever
on
such
i
counted
both
for
myself
and
my
white
servant
when
i
at
length
laid
myself
down
in
a
bed
at
porous
but
to
my
equal
surprise
and
satisfaction
we
both
rose
the
next
morning
without
feeling
the
slightest
inconvenience
from
our
risks
of
the
preceding
day
and
in
the
evening
of
friday
the
i
reached
miss
cole
s
hotel
at
the
spanish
town
one
of
my
young
horses
however
was
so
completely
knocked
up
by
the
fatigue
of
crossing
the
mountain
that
i
could
get
no
further
than
kingston
only
fourteen
miles
this
next
day
in
consequence
of
the
delay
i
was
enabled
to
visit
the
kingston
theatre
the
exterior
is
rather
picturesque
within
it
has
no
particular
recommendations
the
scenery
and
dresses
were
shabby
the
actors
wretched
and
the
stage
ill
lighted
the
performance
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
chief
actress
who
had
but
little
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
number
of
her
audience
and
i
may
reckon
it
among
my
other
misfortunes
on
this
expedition
that
it
was
my
destiny
to
sit
out
the
tragedy
of
adelgitha
whom
the
author
meant
only
to
be
killed
in
the
last
act
but
whom
the
actors
murdered
in
all
five
the
heroine
was
the
only
one
who
spoke
tolerably
but
she
was
old
enough
and
fat
enough
for
the
widow
cheshire
guiscard
did
not
know
ten
words
of
his
part
the
tyrant
was
really
comical
enough
and
lothair
was
played
by
a
young
jamaica
jew
about
fifteen
years
of
age
and
who
is
dignified
here
with
the
name
of
the
creole
his
voice
was
just
breaking
which
made
him
pipe
and
whistle
in
the
sound
his
action
was
awkward
and
altogether
he
was
but
a
sorry
specimen
of
theatrical
talent
however
his
is
said
to
lie
in
broad
farce
which
perhaps
may
account
for
his
being
no
better
in
tragedy
on
sunday
the
i
resumed
my
journey
but
my
horses
were
so
completely
knocked
up
that
i
was
obliged
to
hire
an
additional
pair
to
convey
me
to
miss
hetley
s
inn
on
the
other
side
of
the
yallacks
river
which
is
nineteen
miles
from
kingston
this
river
as
well
as
that
of
morant
which
i
passed
about
ten
miles
further
both
in
breadth
and
strength
sets
all
bridges
at
defiance
and
in
the
rainy
season
it
is
sometimes
impassable
for
several
weeks
on
this
occasion
there
was
but
little
water
in
either
and
i
arrived
without
difficulty
at
port
morant
where
i
found
horses
sent
by
my
trustee
to
convey
me
to
hordley
the
road
led
up
to
the
mountains
and
was
one
of
the
steepest
roughest
and
most
fatiguing
that
i
ever
travelled
in
spite
of
its
picturesque
beauties
at
length
i
reached
my
estate
jaded
and
wearied
to
death
here
i
expected
to
find
a
perfect
paradise
and
i
found
a
perfect
hell
report
had
assured
me
that
hordley
was
the
best
managed
estate
in
the
island
and
as
far
as
the
soil
was
concerned
report
appeared
to
have
said
true
but
my
trustee
had
also
assured
me
that
my
negroes
were
the
most
contented
and
best
disposed
and
here
there
was
a
lamentable
incorrectness
in
the
account
i
found
them
in
a
perfect
uproar
complaints
of
all
kinds
stunned
me
from
all
quarters
all
the
blacks
accused
all
the
whites
and
all
the
whites
accused
all
the
blacks
and
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
both
parties
were
extremely
in
the
right
there
was
no
attachment
to
the
soil
to
be
found
the
negroes
declared
one
and
all
that
if
i
went
away
and
left
them
to
groan
under
the
same
system
of
oppression
without
appeal
or
hope
of
redress
they
would
follow
my
carriage
and
establish
themselves
at
cornwall
i
had
soon
discovered
enough
to
be
certain
that
although
they
told
me
plenty
of
falsehoods
many
of
their
complaints
were
but
too
well
founded
and
yet
how
to
protect
them
for
the
future
or
satisfy
them
for
the
present
was
no
easy
matter
to
decide
trusting
to
these
fallacious
reports
of
the
arcadian
state
of
happiness
upon
hordley
i
supposed
that
i
should
have
nothing
to
do
there
but
grant
a
few
indulgences
and
establish
the
regulations
already
adopted
with
success
on
cornwall
distribute
a
little
money
and
allow
a
couple
of
for
dancing
and
under
this
persuasion
i
had
made
it
quite
impossible
for
me
to
remain
above
a
week
at
hordley
which
i
conceived
to
be
fully
sufficient
for
the
above
purpose
as
to
grievances
to
be
redressed
i
was
totally
unprepared
for
any
such
necessity
yet
now
they
poured
in
upon
me
incessantly
each
more
serious
than
the
former
and
before
hours
were
elapsed
i
had
been
assured
that
in
order
to
produce
any
sort
of
tranquillity
upon
the
estate
i
must
begin
by
displacing
the
trustee
the
physician
the
four
white
and
the
four
black
governors
all
of
whom
i
was
modestly
required
to
remove
and
provide
better
substitutes
in
the
space
of
five
days
and
a
morning
what
with
the
general
clamour
the
assertions
and
denials
the
tears
and
the
passion
the
odious
falsehoods
and
the
still
more
odious
truths
and
worst
of
all
to
me
my
own
vexation
and
disappointment
at
finding
things
so
different
from
my
expectations
at
first
nearly
turned
my
brain
and
i
felt
strongly
tempted
to
set
off
as
fast
as
i
could
and
leave
all
these
black
devils
and
white
ones
to
tear
one
another
to
pieces
an
amusement
in
which
they
appeared
to
be
perfectly
ready
to
indulge
themselves
it
was
however
considerable
relief
to
me
to
find
upon
examination
that
no
act
of
personal
was
alleged
against
the
trustee
himself
who
was
allowed
to
be
sufficiently
humane
in
his
own
nature
and
was
only
complained
of
for
allowing
the
negroes
to
be
maltreated
by
the
and
other
inferior
agents
with
absolute
impunity
being
an
excellent
planter
he
confined
his
attention
entirely
to
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
and
when
the
negroes
came
to
complain
of
some
act
of
cruelty
or
oppression
committed
by
the
or
the
black
governors
he
refused
to
listen
to
them
and
left
their
complaints
unenquired
into
and
consequently
unredressed
the
result
was
that
the
negroes
were
worse
off
than
if
he
had
been
a
cruel
man
himself
for
his
cruelty
would
have
given
them
only
one
tyrant
whereas
his
indolence
left
them
at
the
mercy
of
eight
still
they
said
that
they
would
be
well
contented
to
have
him
continue
their
trustee
provided
that
i
would
appoint
some
protector
to
whom
they
might
appeal
in
cases
of
injustice
and
the
trustee
declaring
himself
well
satisfied
that
some
such
appointment
should
take
place
a
neighbouring
gentleman
whose
humanity
to
his
own
negroes
had
established
him
in
high
favour
with
mine
was
selected
for
this
purpose
i
next
ordered
one
of
the
of
the
atrocious
brutality
of
whose
conduct
the
trustee
himself
upon
examination
allowed
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
to
quit
the
estate
in
two
hours
under
pain
of
prosecution
away
went
the
man
and
when
i
arose
the
next
morning
another
had
taken
himself
off
of
his
own
accord
and
that
in
so
much
haste
that
he
left
all
his
clothes
behind
him
my
next
step
was
to
displace
the
chief
black
governor
a
man
deservedly
odious
to
the
negroes
and
whom
a
gross
and
insolent
lie
told
to
myself
enabled
me
to
punish
without
seeming
to
displace
him
in
compliance
with
their
complaints
against
him
and
these
sources
of
discontent
being
removed
i
read
to
them
my
regulations
for
allowing
them
new
holidays
additional
allowances
of
rum
and
sugar
with
a
variety
of
other
indulgences
and
measures
taken
for
protection
all
which
assisted
by
a
couple
of
dances
and
distribution
of
money
on
the
day
of
my
departure
had
so
good
an
effect
upon
their
tempers
that
i
left
them
in
as
good
humour
apparently
as
i
found
them
in
bad
but
to
leave
them
was
no
such
easy
matter
the
weather
had
been
bad
from
the
moment
of
my
commencing
my
journey
but
from
the
moment
of
my
reaching
hordley
it
became
abominable
the
rain
poured
down
in
cataracts
incessantly
the
old
crazy
house
stands
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
the
north
wind
howled
round
it
night
and
day
shaking
it
from
top
to
bottom
and
threatening
to
become
a
hurricane
the
storm
was
provided
with
a
very
suitable
accompaniment
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
to
complete
the
business
down
came
the
mountain
torrents
and
swelled
plantain
garden
river
to
such
a
degree
that
it
broke
down
the
stopped
the
mill
and
all
work
was
at
a
for
two
days
and
nights
but
the
worst
of
all
was
that
this
same
river
lay
between
me
and
kingston
bridge
there
was
none
and
it
soon
became
utterly
impassable
thus
it
continued
for
four
days
on
the
fifth
the
day
which
i
had
appointed
for
my
departure
and
on
which
i
gave
the
negroes
a
parting
holiday
the
water
appeared
to
be
somewhat
abated
at
a
ford
about
four
miles
distant
for
as
to
crossing
at
my
own
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question
for
a
week
at
least
a
negro
was
despatched
on
horseback
to
ascertain
the
height
of
the
water
his
report
was
very
unfavourable
however
as
at
worst
i
could
but
return
and
had
no
better
means
of
employing
my
time
i
resolved
to
make
the
experiment
about
forty
of
the
youngest
and
strongest
negroes
left
their
dancing
and
drinking
and
ran
on
foot
to
see
me
safe
over
the
water
the
few
hours
which
had
elapsed
since
my
messenger
s
examination
had
operated
very
favourably
towards
the
reduction
of
the
water
although
it
was
still
very
high
but
a
servant
going
before
to
ascertain
the
least
dangerous
passage
and
the
negroes
rushing
all
into
the
river
to
break
the
force
of
the
stream
and
support
the
carriage
on
both
sides
we
were
enabled
to
struggle
to
the
opposite
bank
and
were
landed
in
safety
with
loud
cheering
from
my
sable
attendants
who
then
left
me
many
with
tears
running
down
their
cheeks
and
all
with
thanks
for
the
protection
which
i
had
shown
them
and
earnest
entreaties
that
i
would
come
to
visit
them
another
time
whether
my
visit
will
have
been
productive
of
essential
service
to
them
must
remain
a
doubt
the
trustee
at
least
promised
me
most
solemnly
that
my
regulations
for
their
happiness
and
security
should
be
obeyed
and
that
the
of
which
i
had
detected
beyond
a
doubt
some
very
flagrant
violations
should
be
carried
into
effect
for
the
future
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactness
if
he
breaks
his
promise
and
i
discover
it
i
have
pledged
myself
most
solemnly
to
remove
him
however
great
may
be
his
merits
as
a
planter
if
he
contrives
to
keep
me
in
ignorance
of
his
proceedings
which
however
from
the
precautions
which
i
have
now
taken
i
trust
will
be
no
easy
matter
and
the
state
of
the
negroes
should
continue
after
my
departure
to
be
what
it
was
before
my
arrival
then
i
can
only
console
myself
with
thinking
that
the
guilt
is
his
not
mine
and
that
it
is
on
head
that
the
curse
of
the
sufferers
and
the
vengeance
of
heaven
will
fall
not
on
my
own
i
have
been
told
that
this
estate
of
mine
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
in
the
island
it
may
be
so
for
anything
that
i
can
tell
of
the
matter
the
badness
of
the
weather
and
the
disquietude
of
my
mind
during
the
whole
of
my
short
stay
made
every
thing
look
gloomy
and
hideous
and
when
i
once
found
myself
again
beyond
my
own
limits
i
felt
my
spirits
lighter
by
a
hundred
weight
of
all
the
points
which
had
displeased
me
at
hordley
none
had
made
me
more
angry
for
the
time
than
the
lie
told
me
by
the
chief
governor
which
occasioned
my
displacing
him
this
fellow
who
for
the
credit
of
our
family
no
doubt
had
got
himself
christened
by
the
name
of
john
lewis
had
the
impudence
to
walk
into
my
parlour
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
go
to
bed
and
inform
me
that
he
could
not
get
the
business
of
the
estate
done
why
not
he
could
get
nobody
to
come
to
the
at
the
mill
which
he
supposed
was
the
consequence
of
my
indulging
the
negroes
so
much
indeed
and
where
were
the
people
who
ought
to
come
to
their
in
the
negro
village
no
they
were
in
the
hospital
and
refused
to
come
out
to
work
upon
which
i
blazed
up
like
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
and
volleying
out
in
a
breath
all
the
curses
that
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
i
asked
him
whether
any
person
really
had
been
insolent
enough
to
select
a
whole
night
party
from
the
sick
people
in
the
hospital
not
one
of
whom
ought
to
stir
out
of
it
till
well
there
stood
the
fellow
trembling
and
stammering
and
unable
to
get
out
an
answer
while
i
stamped
up
and
down
the
piazza
storming
and
swearing
banging
all
the
doors
till
the
house
seemed
ready
to
tumble
about
our
ears
and
doing
my
best
to
herod
till
at
last
i
ordered
the
man
to
begone
that
instant
and
get
the
work
done
properly
he
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
and
was
off
in
a
twinkling
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
sent
for
him
again
and
enquired
whether
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
proper
people
to
work
at
the
mill
upon
which
he
had
the
assurance
to
answer
that
all
the
people
were
there
and
that
it
was
not
of
their
not
being
at
the
mill
that
he
had
meant
to
complain
of
what
was
it
then
of
their
not
being
in
the
when
yesterday
he
could
not
get
the
negroes
to
come
to
work
and
so
there
had
been
none
done
all
and
who
refused
to
come
all
the
but
who
but
who
who
who
their
names
their
names
their
names
he
could
not
remember
them
name
one
well
speak
then
speak
there
was
and
who
else
there
was
sally
who
used
to
be
called
and
who
else
there
was
there
was
but
who
else
beck
and
sally
but
who
else
who
else
little
edward
had
gone
out
of
the
hospital
and
had
not
come
to
well
beck
and
sally
and
little
edward
who
else
beck
and
little
edward
and
but
who
else
i
say
who
else
he
could
not
remember
any
body
then
to
be
sure
i
was
in
such
an
imperial
passion
as
would
have
done
honour
to
her
majesty
the
queen
why
you
most
impudent
of
all
impudent
fellows
that
ever
told
a
lie
have
you
really
presumed
to
disturb
me
at
this
time
of
night
prevent
my
going
to
bed
tell
me
that
you
can
t
get
the
business
done
and
that
none
of
the
people
would
come
to
work
and
make
such
a
disturbance
and
all
because
two
old
women
and
a
little
boy
missed
coming
into
the
field
yesterday
down
dropped
the
fellow
in
a
moment
upon
his
marrow
bones
oh
me
good
massa
cried
he
and
out
came
the
truth
which
i
knew
well
enough
before
he
told
me
me
no
come
of
my
own
head
me
to
come
but
me
never
tell
massa
lie
more
so
me
pray
him
forgib
me
but
his
obeying
any
person
on
my
own
estate
in
preference
to
me
and
suffering
himself
to
be
converted
into
an
instrument
of
my
annoyance
was
not
to
be
easily
overlooked
so
i
turned
him
out
of
the
house
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
as
big
as
a
camel
and
the
next
morning
degraded
him
to
the
rank
of
a
common
field
negro
the
trustee
pleaded
hard
for
his
being
permitted
to
return
to
the
waggons
from
whence
he
had
been
taken
and
where
he
would
be
useful
but
i
was
obdurate
then
came
his
wife
to
beg
for
him
and
then
his
mother
and
then
his
cousin
and
then
his
cousin
s
cousin
still
i
was
firm
till
on
the
day
of
my
departure
the
new
chief
governor
came
to
me
in
the
name
of
the
whole
estate
and
bested
me
to
allow
john
lewis
to
return
to
the
command
of
the
waggons
for
that
all
the
negroes
said
that
it
would
be
sad
a
for
them
to
see
a
man
who
had
held
the
highest
place
among
them
degraded
quite
to
be
a
common
field
there
was
something
in
this
appeal
which
argued
so
good
a
feeling
that
i
did
not
think
it
right
to
resist
any
longer
so
i
hinted
that
if
the
trustee
should
ask
it
again
as
a
favour
to
himself
i
might
perhaps
relent
and
the
proper
application
being
thus
made
john
lewis
was
allowed
to
quit
the
field
but
with
a
positive
injunction
against
his
ever
being
employed
again
in
any
office
of
authority
over
the
negroes
i
found
baptism
in
high
vogue
upon
hordley
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
could
not
discover
much
effect
produced
upon
their
minds
by
having
been
made
christians
except
in
one
particular
whenever
one
of
them
told
me
a
monstrous
lie
and
they
told
me
whole
dozens
he
never
failed
to
conclude
his
story
by
saying
and
now
massa
you
know
i
ve
been
christened
and
if
you
do
not
believe
what
i
say
i
m
ready
to
buss
the
booh
to
the
truth
of
the
whole
advantages
to
be
derived
by
negroes
from
becoming
christians
seemed
to
consist
with
them
in
two
points
being
a
superior
species
of
magic
itself
it
preserved
them
from
black
obeah
and
by
enabling
them
to
take
an
oath
upon
the
bible
to
the
truth
of
any
lie
which
it
might
suit
them
to
tell
they
believed
that
it
would
give
them
the
power
of
humbugging
the
white
people
with
perfect
ease
and
convenience
they
had
observed
the
importance
attached
by
the
whites
to
such
an
attestation
and
the
conviction
which
it
always
appeared
to
carry
with
it
as
to
the
crime
or
penalty
of
perjury
of
that
they
were
totally
ignorant
or
at
least
indifferent
therefore
they
were
perfectly
ready
to
buss
the
book
which
they
considered
as
a
piece
of
buckra
superstition
mighty
useful
to
the
negroes
and
valued
taking
their
oath
upon
the
bible
to
a
lie
no
more
than
mincing
did
the
oath
which
she
took
in
the
blue
garret
upon
an
odd
volume
of
messalina
s
although
i
set
out
from
hordley
at
two
o
clock
it
was
past
seven
before
i
reached
an
estate
called
the
retreat
which
was
only
twelve
miles
off
so
abominable
was
the
road
here
i
stopped
for
the
night
which
i
passed
at
supper
with
the
musquitoes
not
where
i
ate
but
where
i
was
morant
river
had
been
swelled
by
the
late
heavy
rains
to
a
tremendous
height
and
its
numerous
quicksands
render
the
passage
in
such
a
state
extremely
dangerous
however
a
negro
having
been
sent
early
to
explore
it
and
having
returned
with
a
favourable
report
we
proceeded
to
encounter
it
a
hordley
negro
well
acquainted
with
these
perilous
rivers
had
accompanied
me
for
the
express
purpose
of
pointing
out
the
most
practicable
fords
but
for
some
time
his
efforts
to
find
a
safe
one
were
unavailing
his
horse
at
the
end
of
a
minute
or
two
plunging
into
a
quicksand
or
some
deep
hole
among
the
waters
thrown
up
from
which
he
totally
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
then
was
seen
to
struggle
out
again
with
such
an
effort
and
leap
as
were
quite
beyond
the
capability
of
any
carriage
s
attempting
however
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
was
fortunate
to
find
a
place
where
he
could
cross
up
to
his
horse
s
belly
in
the
water
to
be
sure
but
at
least
without
tumbling
into
holes
and
quicksands
and
here
we
set
out
conscious
that
our
whole
chance
of
reaching
the
opposite
shore
consisted
in
keeping
precisely
the
path
which
he
had
gone
already
and
determined
to
stick
as
close
as
possible
to
his
horse
s
tail
but
no
sooner
were
we
fairly
in
the
water
than
my
young
horses
found
themselves
unable
to
resist
the
strength
and
rapidity
of
the
torrent
which
was
rolling
down
huge
stones
as
big
as
rocks
from
the
mountain
and
to
my
utter
consternation
i
perceived
the
curricle
carried
down
the
stream
and
the
distance
from
my
guide
who
by
swimming
his
horse
had
reached
the
destined
in
safety
growing
wider
and
wider
with
every
moment
we
were
now
driving
at
all
hazards
every
moment
i
expected
to
see
a
horse
or
a
wheel
sink
down
into
some
deep
hole
the
chaise
overturned
and
ourselves
either
swallowed
up
in
a
quicksand
or
dashed
to
pieces
against
the
stones
which
were
rolling
around
us
i
never
remember
to
have
felt
myself
so
completely
convinced
of
approaching
destruction
and
i
roared
out
with
all
my
might
and
main
we
are
carried
away
all
is
over
although
to
be
sure
i
might
as
well
have
held
my
tongue
seeing
that
all
my
roaring
could
not
do
the
least
possible
good
however
my
horses
although
too
weak
to
resist
the
current
were
fortunately
strong
enough
to
keep
their
legs
while
they
drifted
down
the
stream
they
struggled
along
in
an
oblique
direction
which
gradually
though
but
slowly
brought
us
nearer
to
the
opposite
shore
and
after
several
minutes
passed
in
most
painful
anxiety
a
desperate
plunge
out
of
the
water
enabled
them
to
the
carriage
upon
terra
firma
on
the
same
side
with
my
guide
although
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
spot
where
he
had
landed
the
yallack
s
river
was
less
dangerous
but
even
this
too
had
been
sufficiently
swelled
to
make
the
crossing
it
no
easy
matter
so
that
what
with
one
obstacle
and
another
when
i
reached
kingston
at
six
o
clock
with
my
bones
and
my
vehicle
unbroken
i
was
almost
as
much
surprised
as
satisfied
i
dined
with
the
curate
of
kingston
rev
hill
where
i
met
the
admiral
upon
this
station
sir
home
popham
and
a
large
party
at
kingston
i
was
obliged
to
send
back
a
horse
which
had
been
lent
me
in
aid
of
my
own
another
had
been
dropped
at
the
retreat
a
third
could
get
no
farther
than
the
mountains
and
my
companion
s
three
horses
had
found
themselves
unable
even
to
reach
spanish
town
and
i
had
thus
been
obliged
to
leave
them
and
theirs
behind
upon
the
road
on
the
morning
of
our
departure
from
cornwall
when
my
italian
servant
saw
the
quantity
of
horses
mules
servants
and
carriages
collected
for
the
journey
he
clapped
his
hands
together
in
exultation
and
exclaimed
they
will
certainly
take
us
for
the
king
of
england
but
now
when
after
leaving
one
horse
in
one
place
and
another
horse
in
another
on
the
morning
of
monday
the
he
beheld
my
whole
caravan
reduced
to
one
pair
of
chaise
horses
and
a
couple
of
miserable
mules
he
cast
a
rueful
look
upon
my
diminished
cavalry
and
sighed
to
himself
i
verily
believe
we
shall
return
home
on
foot
after
all
i
reached
spanish
town
in
time
to
dine
with
the
chief
justice
jackson
and
intended
to
remain
two
or
three
days
longer
but
the
fatality
which
had
persecuted
me
from
the
very
commencement
of
this
abominable
journey
was
not
exhausted
yet
on
tuesday
morning
my
landlady
just
hinted
that
she
thought
it
right
to
let
me
know
that
to
be
sure
there
a
gentleman
unwell
in
the
house
but
she
supposed
that
i
should
not
care
about
it
however
if
i
particularly
disliked
the
neighbourhood
of
a
sick
person
she
would
procure
me
i
asked
what
was
the
complaint
oh
he
was
a
little
sick
that
was
to
which
i
only
could
answer
that
in
that
case
i
hoped
he
would
get
better
and
thought
no
more
about
it
however
when
i
went
to
visit
the
governor
i
found
that
this
little
sickness
of
my
landlady
s
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
yellow
fever
of
which
the
gentleman
in
question
was
now
dying
of
which
a
lady
had
died
only
two
days
before
and
of
which
another
european
newly
arrived
had
fallen
ill
in
this
very
same
hotel
only
a
fortnight
before
and
had
died
after
throwing
himself
out
of
an
upper
window
in
a
fit
of
delirium
under
all
these
circumstances
i
thought
it
to
the
full
as
prudent
not
to
prolong
my
residence
in
spanish
town
and
accordingly
on
wednesday
the
i
resumed
my
journey
homewards
i
travelled
the
north
side
of
the
island
which
was
the
road
used
by
me
on
my
return
two
years
ago
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
my
former
account
of
it
except
that
there
need
not
be
better
inns
anywhere
than
the
wellington
hotel
at
rio
bueno
and
judy
james
s
at
montego
bay
which
latter
is
now
in
my
opinion
by
far
the
prettiest
town
in
jamaica
indeed
all
the
inns
upon
this
road
are
excellent
with
the
solitary
exception
of
the
tavern
which
i
stopped
at
by
a
mistake
instead
of
that
of
montague
at
this
most
miserable
of
all
inns
that
ever
entrapped
an
unwary
traveller
there
was
literally
nothing
to
be
procured
for
love
or
money
no
corn
for
the
horses
no
wine
without
sending
six
miles
for
a
bottle
no
food
but
a
miserable
starved
fowl
so
tough
that
the
very
negroes
could
not
eat
it
and
a
couple
of
eggs
one
of
which
was
addled
there
was
but
one
pair
of
sheets
in
the
whole
house
and
neither
candles
nor
oranges
nor
pepper
nor
vinegar
nor
bread
nor
even
so
much
as
sugar
white
or
brown
yams
there
were
which
prevented
my
servants
from
going
to
bed
quite
empty
and
i
contented
myself
with
the
bottle
of
wine
and
the
solitary
egg
which
i
eat
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
filled
with
stinking
oil
the
one
pair
of
sheets
i
seized
upon
to
my
own
share
and
my
servants
made
themselves
as
good
beds
as
they
could
upon
the
floor
with
great
coats
and
travelling
mantles
it
was
on
wednesday
night
that
after
the
fatigue
of
crossing
mount
diablo
myself
i
unfatigued
in
this
delectable
retreat
which
seemed
to
have
been
established
upon
principles
diametrically
opposite
to
those
of
shenstone
s
on
thursday
i
slept
at
rio
bueno
on
friday
at
montego
bay
passed
saturday
at
anchovy
estate
plummer
s
and
was
very
glad
on
sunday
the
to
find
myself
once
more
quietly
established
at
cornwall
fully
determined
to
leave
it
no
more
till
i
leave
it
on
my
return
to
england
the
lady
who
had
died
so
lately
at
kingston
had
arrived
not
long
before
in
a
vessel
both
the
crew
and
passengers
of
which
landed
to
all
appearance
in
perfect
health
after
a
favourable
passage
from
england
of
course
they
soon
dispersed
in
different
directions
yet
almost
all
of
them
were
attacked
nearly
at
the
same
period
by
the
fever
which
seemed
to
have
a
particular
commission
to
search
out
such
persons
as
had
arrived
by
that
particular
ship
at
however
remote
a
distance
they
might
be
from
each
other
march
sunday
this
morning
without
either
fault
or
accident
a
young
strong
healthy
woman
miscarried
of
an
eight
months
child
and
this
is
the
third
time
that
she
has
met
with
a
similar
misfortune
no
other
symptom
of
has
been
given
in
the
course
of
this
year
nor
are
there
above
eight
women
upon
the
breeding
list
out
of
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
females
yet
they
are
all
well
clothed
and
well
fed
contented
in
mind
even
by
their
own
account
at
no
time
and
when
upon
the
breeding
list
are
exempted
from
labour
of
every
kind
in
spite
of
all
this
and
their
being
treated
with
all
possible
care
and
indulgence
rewarded
for
bringing
children
and
therefore
anxious
themselves
to
have
them
how
they
manage
it
so
ill
i
know
not
but
somehow
or
other
certainly
the
children
do
not
come
march
during
the
whole
three
weeks
of
my
absence
only
two
negroes
have
been
complained
of
for
committing
fault
the
first
was
a
domestic
quarrel
between
two
africans
hazard
stole
frank
s
calabash
of
sugar
which
frank
had
previously
stolen
out
of
my
so
frank
broke
hazard
s
head
which
in
my
opinion
settled
the
matter
so
properly
that
i
declined
spoiling
it
by
any
interference
of
my
own
the
other
complaint
was
more
serious
toby
being
ordered
to
load
the
cart
with
canes
answered
i
wo
nt
and
toby
was
as
good
as
his
word
in
consequence
of
which
the
mill
stopped
for
want
of
canes
and
the
boilinghouse
stopped
for
want
of
liquor
i
found
on
my
return
that
for
this
offence
toby
had
received
six
lashes
which
toby
did
not
mind
three
straws
but
as
his
fault
amounted
to
an
act
of
downright
rebellion
i
thought
that
it
ought
not
by
any
means
to
be
passed
over
so
lightly
and
that
toby
ought
to
be
to
mind
i
took
no
notice
for
some
days
but
the
easter
holidays
had
been
deferred
till
my
return
and
only
began
here
on
friday
last
on
that
day
as
soon
as
the
head
governor
had
blown
the
shell
and
dismissed
the
negroes
till
monday
morning
he
requested
the
pleasure
of
toby
s
company
to
the
hospital
where
he
locked
him
up
in
a
room
by
himself
all
saturday
and
sunday
the
estate
rang
with
laughing
dancing
singing
and
huzzaing
was
given
away
in
the
morning
the
children
played
at
ninepins
for
jackets
and
petticoats
in
the
evening
rum
and
sugar
was
denied
to
no
one
the
gumbys
thundered
the
clattered
all
was
noise
and
festivity
and
all
this
while
morens
sat
solitary
toby
gazing
at
his
four
white
walls
toby
had
not
minded
the
lashes
but
the
loss
of
his
amusement
and
the
disgrace
of
his
exclusion
from
the
fête
operated
on
his
mind
so
forcibly
that
when
on
the
monday
morning
his
door
was
unlocked
and
the
chief
governor
called
him
to
his
work
not
a
word
would
he
deign
to
utter
let
who
would
speak
there
he
sat
motionless
silent
and
sulky
however
upon
my
going
down
to
him
myself
his
voice
thought
proper
to
return
and
he
began
at
once
to
complain
of
his
seclusion
and
justify
his
conduct
but
he
no
sooner
opened
his
lips
than
the
whole
hospital
opened
theirs
to
censure
his
folly
asking
him
how
he
could
presume
to
justify
himself
when
he
knew
that
he
had
done
wrong
and
advising
him
to
humble
himself
and
beg
my
pardon
and
their
clamours
were
so
loud
and
so
general
sappho
his
wife
being
one
of
the
loudest
who
not
only
gave
it
him
on
both
sides
of
his
ears
but
enforced
her
arguments
by
a
knock
on
the
pate
now
and
then
that
they
fairly
drove
the
evil
spirit
out
of
him
he
confessed
his
fault
with
great
penitence
engaged
solemnly
never
to
commit
such
another
and
set
off
to
his
work
full
of
gratitude
for
my
granting
him
forgiveness
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
every
day
that
the
best
and
easiest
mode
of
governing
negroes
and
governed
by
some
mode
or
other
they
must
be
is
not
by
the
detestable
lash
but
by
confinement
solitary
or
otherwise
they
can
not
bear
it
and
the
memory
of
it
seems
to
make
a
lasting
impression
upon
their
minds
while
the
lash
makes
none
but
upon
their
skins
and
lasts
no
longer
than
the
mark
the
order
at
my
hospital
is
that
no
negro
should
be
denied
admittance
even
if
no
symptoms
of
illness
appear
he
is
allowed
one
day
to
rest
and
take
physic
if
he
choose
it
on
the
second
morning
if
the
physician
declares
the
man
to
be
shamming
and
the
plea
of
illness
is
still
alleged
against
going
to
work
then
the
negro
is
locked
up
in
a
room
with
others
similarly
circumstanced
where
care
is
taken
to
supply
him
with
food
water
physic
and
no
restraint
is
imposed
except
that
of
not
going
out
here
he
is
suffered
to
remain
unmolested
as
long
as
he
pleases
and
he
is
only
allowed
to
leave
the
hospital
upon
his
own
declaration
that
he
is
well
enough
to
go
to
work
when
the
door
is
opened
and
he
walks
away
unreproached
and
unpunished
however
evident
his
deception
may
have
been
before
i
adopted
this
regulation
the
number
of
patients
used
to
vary
from
thirty
to
not
more
than
a
dozen
of
whom
perhaps
had
anything
the
matter
with
them
the
number
at
this
moment
is
but
fourteen
and
all
are
sores
burns
or
complaints
the
reality
of
which
speaks
for
itself
some
few
persevering
tricksters
will
still
submit
to
be
locked
up
for
a
day
or
two
but
their
patience
never
fails
to
be
wearied
out
by
the
fourth
morning
and
i
have
not
yet
met
with
an
instance
of
a
patient
who
had
once
been
locked
up
with
a
fictitious
illness
returning
to
the
hospital
except
with
a
real
one
in
general
they
offer
to
take
a
day
s
rest
and
physic
promising
to
go
out
to
work
the
next
day
and
on
these
occasions
they
have
uniformly
kept
their
word
indeed
my
hospital
is
now
in
such
good
order
that
the
physician
told
the
trustee
the
other
day
that
mine
gave
him
less
trouble
than
any
hospital
in
the
my
boilers
too
who
used
to
make
sugar
the
colour
of
mahogany
are
now
making
excellent
and
certainly
if
appearances
may
be
trusted
and
things
will
but
last
i
may
flatter
myself
with
the
complete
success
of
my
system
of
management
as
far
as
the
time
elapsed
is
sufficient
to
warrant
an
opinion
i
only
wish
from
my
soul
that
i
were
but
half
as
certain
of
the
good
treatment
and
good
behaviour
of
the
negroes
at
hordley
april
wednesday
having
had
two
leathern
purses
full
of
silver
coin
stolen
out
of
her
trunk
her
cousin
punch
told
her
to
have
patience
till
sunday
and
he
thought
that
by
that
time
he
should
be
able
to
find
it
for
her
upon
which
she
very
naturally
suspected
her
cousin
punch
of
having
stolen
the
money
himself
and
brought
him
to
day
to
make
her
charge
against
him
however
he
stuck
firmly
to
a
denial
and
as
several
days
had
been
suffered
to
elapse
since
the
theft
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
having
concealed
the
money
and
therefore
no
utility
in
searching
his
person
or
his
house
i
found
great
fault
with
the
persons
in
authority
for
not
having
taken
such
a
measure
without
a
moment
s
delay
but
the
trustee
informed
me
that
it
frequently
produced
very
serious
consequences
many
instances
having
occurred
of
the
disgrace
of
their
house
being
searched
having
offended
negroes
so
much
to
the
heart
as
to
occasion
their
committing
suicide
so
that
it
was
a
proceeding
which
was
seldom
ventured
upon
without
urgent
necessity
it
was
now
too
late
to
take
it
at
all
events
the
man
confessed
indeed
that
he
had
quitted
his
work
and
gone
down
to
the
on
the
day
of
the
robbery
which
rendered
his
guilt
highly
probable
but
he
could
be
brought
to
confess
no
more
and
as
to
his
saying
that
he
thought
he
could
find
the
money
by
sunday
he
explained
into
an
intention
of
going
to
consult
a
brown
woman
at
the
bay
who
was
a
and
who
when
any
thing
was
stolen
could
always
point
out
the
thief
by
the
this
was
all
that
we
could
extract
from
him
and
we
were
obliged
to
dismiss
him
however
the
fright
of
his
examination
was
not
without
good
consequences
one
of
the
stolen
purses
had
belonged
to
a
sister
of
s
not
long
deceased
and
on
her
return
home
purse
with
its
contents
untouched
was
found
lying
on
the
sister
s
grave
in
her
garden
perhaps
the
thief
had
taken
it
without
knowing
the
owner
and
on
finding
that
it
had
belonged
to
a
dead
person
he
had
surrendered
it
through
apprehension
of
being
haunted
by
her
april
sunday
clearing
their
grounds
by
fire
is
a
very
expeditious
proceeding
consequently
in
much
practice
among
the
negroes
but
in
this
tindery
country
it
is
extremely
dangerous
and
forbidden
by
the
law
as
i
returned
home
from
church
i
observed
a
large
smoke
at
no
great
distance
and
cubina
told
me
he
supposed
that
the
negroes
of
the
neighbouring
estate
of
amity
were
clearing
their
grounds
then
they
are
doing
a
very
wrong
thing
said
i
i
hope
they
will
fire
nothing
else
but
their
grounds
for
with
so
strong
a
breeze
a
great
deal
of
mischief
might
be
however
in
half
an
hour
it
proved
that
the
smoke
in
question
arose
from
my
own
that
the
fire
had
spread
itself
and
i
could
see
from
my
window
the
flames
and
smoke
pouring
themselves
upwards
in
large
volumes
while
the
crackling
of
the
dry
bushes
and
was
something
perfectly
terrific
the
alarm
was
instantly
given
and
whites
and
blacks
all
hurried
to
the
scene
of
action
luckily
the
breeze
set
the
contrary
way
from
the
plantations
a
morass
interposed
itself
between
the
blazing
ground
and
one
of
my
best
the
flames
were
suffered
to
burn
till
they
reached
the
brink
of
the
water
and
then
the
negroes
managed
to
extinguish
them
without
much
difficulty
thus
we
escaped
without
injury
but
i
own
i
was
heartily
frightened
april
this
morning
i
was
awaked
by
a
violent
coughing
in
the
hospital
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
any
of
the
servants
moving
i
despatched
a
negro
to
ask
whether
any
body
was
bad
in
the
hospital
he
returned
and
told
me
no
massa
nobody
bad
there
for
alick
is
better
and
nelson
is
nelson
was
one
of
my
best
labourers
and
had
come
into
the
hospital
for
a
glandular
swelling
early
this
morning
he
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
burst
a
large
artery
and
was
immediately
suffocated
in
his
blood
this
is
the
sixth
death
in
the
course
of
the
first
three
months
of
the
year
and
we
have
not
as
yet
a
single
birth
for
a
say
what
one
will
to
the
negroes
and
treat
them
as
well
as
one
can
obstinate
devils
they
will
die
april
i
had
mentioned
to
shand
my
having
found
a
woman
at
hordley
who
had
been
crippled
for
life
in
consequence
of
her
having
been
kicked
in
the
womb
by
one
of
the
he
writes
to
me
on
this
subject
i
trust
that
conduct
so
savage
occurs
rarely
in
country
i
can
only
say
that
in
my
long
experience
nothing
of
the
kind
has
ever
fallen
under
my
then
ought
to
consider
as
having
been
in
high
luck
i
have
not
passed
six
months
in
jamaica
and
i
have
already
found
on
one
of
my
estates
a
woman
who
had
been
kicked
in
the
womb
by
a
white
by
which
she
was
crippled
herself
and
on
another
of
my
estates
another
woman
who
had
been
kicked
in
the
womb
by
another
white
by
which
he
had
crippled
the
child
the
name
of
the
first
man
and
woman
were
lory
and
jeannette
those
of
the
second
were
and
martia
and
thus
as
my
two
estates
are
at
the
two
extremities
of
the
island
i
am
entitled
to
say
from
my
own
knowledge
speaking
observe
that
white
kick
black
women
in
the
belly
one
end
of
jamaica
to
the
april
wednesday
about
noon
a
healthy
lad
of
seventeen
years
of
age
was
employed
in
unhaltering
the
first
pair
of
oxen
of
one
of
the
waggons
in
doing
which
he
entangled
his
right
leg
in
the
rope
at
that
moment
the
oxen
set
off
full
gallop
and
dragged
the
boy
along
with
them
round
the
whole
inclosure
before
the
other
negroes
could
succeed
in
stopping
them
however
when
the
prisoner
was
extricated
although
his
flesh
appeared
to
have
been
terribly
lacerated
no
bones
were
broken
and
he
was
even
able
to
walk
to
the
hospital
without
support
he
was
blooded
instantly
and
two
physicians
were
sent
for
by
express
at
two
o
clock
he
was
still
in
perfect
possession
of
his
senses
and
only
complained
of
the
soreness
of
his
wounds
but
in
half
an
hour
after
he
became
apoplectic
sank
into
a
state
of
utter
insensibility
during
which
a
dreadful
rattling
in
his
throat
was
the
only
sign
of
still
existing
life
and
before
six
in
the
evening
all
was
over
with
him
april
pickle
had
accused
his
edward
the
eboe
of
having
given
him
a
pleurisy
by
the
practice
of
obeah
during
my
last
visit
i
had
convinced
him
that
the
charge
was
unjust
or
at
least
he
had
declared
himself
to
be
convinced
and
about
six
weeks
ago
they
came
together
to
assure
me
that
ever
since
they
had
lived
upon
the
best
terms
possible
unluckily
pickle
s
wife
miscarried
lately
and
for
the
third
time
previously
to
which
edward
had
said
that
his
wife
would
remain
sole
heiress
of
the
father
s
property
this
was
enough
to
set
the
suspicious
brains
of
these
foolish
people
at
work
and
pickle
and
his
old
damon
came
to
assure
me
that
in
order
to
prevent
a
child
coming
to
claim
its
share
of
the
grandfather
s
property
edward
had
practised
obeah
to
make
his
miscarry
the
only
proof
of
which
adduced
was
the
above
expression
and
the
woman
s
having
miscarried
just
according
to
edward
s
very
words
to
reason
with
such
very
absurd
persons
was
out
of
the
case
i
found
too
that
the
two
sisters
were
quarrelling
perpetually
and
always
on
the
point
of
tearing
each
other
s
eyes
out
therefore
as
domestic
peace
in
a
house
so
disunited
was
out
of
the
question
i
ordered
the
two
families
to
separate
instantly
and
to
live
at
the
two
extremities
of
the
negro
village
at
the
same
time
forbidding
all
intercourse
between
them
whatsoever
a
plan
which
was
received
with
approbation
by
all
parties
and
edward
moved
his
property
out
of
the
old
man
s
house
into
another
without
loss
of
time
among
other
charges
of
obeah
pickle
declared
that
his
house
having
been
robbed
edward
had
told
him
that
nato
was
the
offender
and
in
order
to
prove
it
beyond
the
power
of
doubt
he
had
made
him
look
at
something
round
just
like
massa
s
watch
out
of
which
he
had
taken
a
sentee
a
something
which
looked
like
an
egg
this
he
gave
to
pickle
at
the
same
time
instructing
him
to
throw
it
at
night
against
the
door
of
nato
s
house
which
he
had
no
sooner
done
and
broken
the
egg
than
the
very
next
day
nato
s
wife
philippa
began
to
bawl
and
halloo
and
went
now
that
philippa
had
bawled
and
hallooed
enough
was
certainly
true
but
it
was
also
true
that
she
had
confessed
her
madness
to
have
been
a
trick
for
the
purpose
of
exciting
my
compassion
and
inducing
me
to
feed
her
from
my
own
table
yet
was
this
simple
fellow
persuaded
that
he
had
made
her
go
mad
by
the
help
of
his
broken
egg
and
his
old
fool
of
a
was
goose
enough
to
encourage
him
in
the
persuasion
april
sunday
and
massa
said
bridget
the
doctoress
this
morning
my
old
mother
a
lilly
and
him
tank
massa
much
for
the
good
supper
massa
send
last
night
and
him
like
it
so
laud
massa
the
old
lady
was
just
thinking
what
him
could
yam
eat
and
him
no
fancy
nothing
and
him
could
no
yam
salt
and
him
just
wishing
for
something
fresh
when
at
that
very
moment
come
to
him
from
massa
with
a
stewed
pig
s
head
so
fresh
it
seemed
just
as
if
massa
had
got
it
from
the
almighty
s
hands
april
naturalists
and
physicians
philosophers
and
philanthropists
may
argue
and
decide
as
they
please
but
certainly
as
far
as
mere
observation
admits
of
my
judging
there
does
seem
to
be
a
very
great
difference
between
the
brain
of
a
black
person
and
a
white
one
i
should
think
that
voltaire
would
call
a
negro
s
reason
raison
très
somehow
or
other
they
never
can
manage
to
do
anything
as
it
should
be
done
if
they
correct
themselves
in
one
respect
they
are
sure
of
making
a
blunder
in
some
other
manner
cubina
is
now
and
has
all
his
life
been
employed
about
the
stable
he
goes
out
with
my
carriage
twice
every
day
yet
he
has
never
yet
been
able
to
succeed
in
putting
on
the
harness
properly
before
we
get
to
one
of
the
plantation
gates
we
are
certain
of
being
obliged
to
stop
and
put
something
or
other
to
rights
and
i
once
remember
having
laboured
for
more
than
half
an
hour
to
make
him
understand
that
the
christmas
holidays
came
at
christmas
when
asked
the
question
he
always
hesitated
and
answered
at
july
or
yet
cubina
is
far
superior
in
intellect
to
most
of
the
negroes
who
have
fallen
under
my
observation
the
girl
too
whose
business
it
is
to
open
the
house
each
morning
has
in
vain
been
desired
to
unclose
all
the
jalousies
she
never
fails
to
leave
three
or
four
closed
and
when
she
is
scolded
for
doing
so
she
takes
care
to
open
those
three
the
next
morning
and
leaves
three
shut
on
the
opposite
side
indeed
the
attempt
to
make
them
correct
a
fault
is
quite
fruitless
they
never
can
do
the
same
thing
a
second
time
in
the
same
manner
and
if
the
cook
having
succeeded
in
dressing
a
dish
well
is
desired
to
dress
just
such
another
she
is
certain
of
doing
something
which
makes
it
quite
different
one
day
i
desired
that
there
might
be
always
a
piece
of
salt
meat
at
dinner
in
order
that
i
might
be
certain
of
always
having
enough
to
send
to
the
sick
in
the
hospital
in
consequence
there
was
nothing
at
dinner
but
salt
meat
i
complained
that
there
was
not
a
single
fresh
dish
and
the
next
day
there
was
nothing
but
fresh
sometimes
there
is
scarcely
anything
served
up
and
the
cook
seems
to
have
forgotten
the
dinner
altogether
she
is
told
of
it
and
the
next
day
she
slaughters
without
mercy
pigs
sheep
fowls
ducks
turkeys
and
everything
that
she
can
lay
her
murderous
hands
upon
till
the
table
absolutely
groans
under
the
load
of
her
labours
for
above
a
month
cubina
and
i
had
perpetual
quarrels
about
the
cats
being
shut
into
the
gallery
at
nights
where
they
threw
down
plates
glasses
and
crockery
of
all
kinds
and
made
such
a
clatter
that
to
get
a
wink
of
sleep
was
quite
out
of
the
question
cubina
before
he
went
to
rest
hunted
under
all
the
beds
and
sofas
and
laid
about
him
with
a
long
whip
for
half
an
hour
together
but
in
half
an
hour
after
his
departure
the
cats
were
at
work
again
he
was
then
told
that
although
he
had
turned
them
out
he
must
certainly
have
left
some
window
open
he
promised
to
pay
particular
attention
to
this
point
but
that
night
the
uproar
was
worse
than
ever
yet
he
protested
that
he
had
carefully
turned
out
all
the
cats
locked
all
the
doors
and
shut
all
the
windows
he
was
told
that
if
he
had
really
turned
out
all
the
cats
the
cats
must
have
got
in
again
and
therefore
that
he
must
have
left
some
one
window
open
at
least
no
he
said
he
had
not
left
one
but
a
pane
in
one
of
the
windows
had
been
broken
two
months
before
and
it
was
there
that
the
cats
got
in
whenever
they
yet
he
had
continued
to
turn
the
cats
out
of
the
door
with
the
greatest
care
although
he
was
perfectly
conscious
that
they
could
always
walk
in
again
at
the
window
in
five
minutes
after
but
the
most
curious
of
cubina
s
modes
of
proceeding
is
when
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
attack
the
he
steals
up
the
ladder
as
slily
and
as
softly
as
foot
can
fall
he
opens
the
door
and
steals
in
his
head
with
the
utmost
caution
on
which
to
his
surprise
and
disappointment
all
the
pigeons
make
their
escape
through
the
open
holes
he
has
now
no
resource
but
entering
the
and
remaining
there
with
unwearied
patience
for
the
accidental
return
of
the
birds
which
nine
times
out
of
ten
does
not
take
place
till
too
late
for
dinner
and
cubina
returns
having
observed
this
proceeding
constantly
repeated
during
a
fortnight
i
took
pity
upon
his
embarrassment
and
ordered
two
wooden
sliders
to
be
fitted
to
the
holes
cubina
was
delighted
with
this
exquisite
invention
and
failed
not
the
next
morning
to
close
all
the
holes
on
the
right
with
one
of
the
sliders
he
then
stepped
boldly
into
the
when
to
his
utter
confusion
the
pigeons
flew
away
through
the
holes
on
the
left
here
then
he
discovered
where
the
fault
lay
so
he
lost
no
time
in
closing
the
remaining
aperture
with
the
second
slider
and
the
pigeons
were
thus
prevented
from
returning
at
all
cubina
waited
long
with
exemplary
patience
but
without
success
so
he
abandoned
the
new
invention
in
despair
made
no
farther
use
of
the
sliders
and
continues
to
steal
up
the
ladder
as
he
did
before
a
few
days
ago
nicholas
a
mulatto
carpenter
was
ordered
to
make
a
box
for
the
conveyance
of
four
jars
of
sweetmeats
of
which
he
took
previous
measure
yet
first
he
made
a
box
so
small
that
it
would
scarcely
hold
a
single
jar
and
then
another
so
large
that
it
would
have
held
twenty
and
when
at
length
he
produced
one
of
a
proper
size
he
brought
it
nailed
up
for
travelling
although
it
was
completely
empty
and
nailed
up
so
effectually
too
that
on
being
directed
to
open
it
that
the
jars
might
be
packed
he
split
the
cover
to
pieces
in
the
attempt
to
take
it
off
yet
among
all
my
negroes
nicholas
and
cubina
are
not
equalled
for
adroitness
and
intelligence
by
more
than
twenty
judge
then
what
must
be
the
remaining
three
hundred
april
in
my
medical
capacity
like
a
true
quack
i
sometimes
perform
cures
so
unexpected
that
i
stand
like
katterfelto
with
my
hair
standing
on
end
at
my
own
last
night
alexander
the
second
governor
who
has
been
seriously
ill
for
some
days
sent
me
word
that
he
was
suffering
cruelly
from
a
pain
in
his
head
and
could
get
no
sleep
i
knew
not
how
to
relieve
him
but
having
frequently
observed
a
violent
passion
for
perfumes
in
the
house
negroes
for
want
of
something
else
i
gave
the
doctoress
some
oil
of
lavender
and
told
her
to
rub
two
or
three
drops
upon
his
nostrils
this
morning
he
told
me
that
to
be
sure
what
i
had
sent
him
was
a
grand
medicine
indeed
for
it
had
no
sooner
touched
his
nose
than
he
felt
cold
run
up
to
his
forehead
over
his
head
and
all
the
way
down
his
neck
to
the
instantly
the
headach
left
him
he
fell
fast
asleep
nor
had
the
pain
returned
in
the
morning
but
i
am
afraid
that
even
this
wonderful
oil
would
fail
of
curing
a
complaint
which
was
made
to
me
a
few
days
ago
a
poor
old
creature
named
quasheba
made
her
appearance
at
my
breakfast
table
and
told
me
that
she
was
almost
eighty
had
been
rather
weakly
for
some
time
past
and
somehow
she
did
not
feel
as
she
was
by
any
means
had
she
seen
the
doctor
did
she
want
physic
no
she
had
taken
too
much
physic
already
and
the
doctor
would
do
her
no
good
she
did
not
want
to
see
the
but
what
then
was
her
complaint
oh
she
had
no
particular
complaint
only
she
was
old
and
weakly
and
did
not
find
herself
by
any
means
so
well
as
she
used
to
be
and
so
she
came
just
to
tell
massa
and
see
what
he
could
do
to
make
her
quite
right
again
that
was
in
short
she
wanted
me
to
make
her
young
again
april
forbes
is
dead
when
i
was
last
in
jamaica
he
had
just
been
poisoned
with
corrosive
sublimate
by
a
female
slave
who
was
executed
in
consequence
he
never
was
well
afterwards
but
as
he
lived
intemperately
the
whole
blame
of
his
death
must
not
be
laid
upon
the
poison
april
a
free
mulatto
of
the
name
of
rolph
had
frequently
been
mentioned
to
me
by
different
magistrates
as
remarkable
for
the
numerous
complaints
brought
against
him
for
cruel
treatment
of
his
negroes
he
was
described
to
me
as
the
son
of
a
white
ploughman
who
at
his
death
left
his
son
six
or
seven
slaves
with
whom
he
resides
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
where
the
remoteness
of
the
situation
secures
him
from
observation
or
control
his
slaves
indeed
every
now
and
then
contrive
to
escape
and
come
down
to
savannah
la
mar
to
lodge
their
complaints
but
the
magistrates
hitherto
had
never
been
able
to
get
a
legal
hold
upon
him
however
a
few
days
ago
he
entered
the
house
of
a
edgins
when
she
was
from
home
and
behaving
in
an
outrageous
manner
to
her
slaves
he
was
desired
by
the
to
go
away
highly
incensed
he
answered
that
if
the
fellow
dared
to
speak
another
word
it
should
be
the
last
that
he
should
ever
the
negro
dared
to
make
a
rejoinder
upon
which
rolph
aimed
a
blow
at
him
with
a
stick
which
missed
his
intended
victim
but
struck
another
slave
who
was
interposing
to
prevent
a
scuffle
and
killed
him
upon
the
spot
the
murder
was
committed
in
the
presence
of
several
negroes
but
negroes
are
not
allowed
to
give
evidence
and
as
no
free
person
was
present
there
are
not
only
doubts
whether
the
murderer
will
be
punished
but
whether
he
can
even
be
put
upon
his
trial
may
friday
this
morning
i
signed
the
manumission
of
nicholas
cameron
the
best
of
my
mulatto
carpenters
he
had
been
so
often
on
the
very
point
of
getting
his
liberty
and
still
the
cup
was
dashed
from
his
lips
that
i
had
promised
to
set
him
free
whenever
he
could
procure
an
able
negro
as
his
substitute
although
being
a
good
workman
a
single
negro
was
by
no
means
an
adequate
price
in
exchange
on
my
arrival
this
year
i
found
that
he
had
agreed
to
pay
for
a
female
negro
and
the
woman
was
approved
of
by
my
trustee
but
on
enquiry
it
appeared
that
she
had
a
child
from
which
she
was
unwilling
to
separate
and
that
her
owner
refused
to
sell
the
child
except
at
a
most
unreasonable
price
here
then
was
an
insurmountable
objection
to
my
accepting
her
and
nicholas
was
told
to
his
great
mortification
that
he
must
look
out
for
another
substitute
the
woman
on
her
part
was
determined
to
belong
to
cornwall
estate
and
no
other
so
she
told
her
owner
that
if
he
attempted
to
sell
her
elsewhere
she
would
make
away
with
herself
and
on
his
ordering
her
to
prepare
for
a
removal
to
a
neighbouring
proprietor
s
she
disappeared
and
concealed
herself
so
well
that
for
some
time
she
was
believed
to
have
put
her
threats
of
suicide
into
execution
the
idea
of
losing
his
frightened
her
master
so
completely
that
he
declared
himself
ready
to
let
me
have
the
child
at
a
fair
price
as
well
as
the
mother
if
she
ever
should
be
found
and
her
friends
having
conveyed
this
assurance
to
her
she
thought
proper
to
emerge
from
her
and
the
bargain
was
arranged
finally
the
titles
however
were
not
yet
made
out
and
as
the
time
of
my
departure
for
hordley
was
arrived
these
were
ordered
to
be
got
ready
against
my
return
when
the
negroes
were
to
be
delivered
over
to
me
and
nicholas
was
to
be
set
free
in
the
meanwhile
the
child
was
sent
by
her
mistress
a
free
mulatto
to
hide
some
stolen
ducks
upon
a
distant
property
and
on
her
return
blabbed
out
the
errand
in
consequence
the
mistress
was
committed
to
prison
for
theft
and
no
sooner
was
she
released
than
she
revenged
herself
upon
the
poor
girl
by
giving
her
thirty
lashes
with
the
inflicted
with
all
the
severity
of
vindictive
malice
this
treatment
of
a
child
of
such
tender
years
reduced
her
to
such
a
state
as
made
the
magistrates
think
it
right
to
send
her
for
protection
to
the
workhouse
until
the
conduct
of
the
mistress
should
have
been
enquired
into
in
the
meanwhile
as
the
result
of
the
enquiry
might
be
the
setting
the
girl
at
liberty
the
joint
title
for
her
and
her
mother
could
not
be
made
out
and
thus
poor
nicholas
s
manumission
was
at
a
again
the
magistrates
at
length
decided
that
although
the
chastisement
had
been
severe
yet
according
to
the
medical
report
it
was
not
such
as
to
authorise
the
sending
the
mistress
to
be
tried
at
the
assizes
she
was
accordingly
dismissed
from
farther
investigation
and
the
girl
was
once
more
considered
as
belonging
to
me
as
soon
as
the
title
could
be
made
out
but
the
fatality
which
had
so
often
prevented
nicholas
from
obtaining
his
freedom
was
not
weary
yet
on
the
very
morning
when
he
was
to
sign
the
title
a
person
whose
signature
was
indispensable
was
thrown
out
of
his
chaise
the
wheel
of
which
passed
over
his
head
and
he
was
rendered
incapable
of
transacting
business
for
several
weeks
yesterday
the
titles
were
at
length
brought
to
me
complete
and
this
morning
put
nicholas
in
possession
of
the
object
in
the
pursuit
of
which
he
has
experienced
such
repeated
disappointments
the
conduct
of
the
poor
child
s
mulatto
mistress
in
this
case
was
most
unpardonable
and
is
only
one
of
numerous
instances
of
a
similar
description
which
have
been
mentioned
to
me
indeed
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
nothing
can
be
uniformly
more
wretched
than
the
life
of
the
slaves
of
free
people
of
colour
in
jamaica
nor
would
any
thing
contribute
more
to
the
relief
of
the
black
population
than
the
prohibiting
by
law
any
mulatto
to
become
the
owner
of
a
slave
for
the
future
why
should
not
rich
people
of
colour
be
served
by
poor
people
of
colour
hiring
them
as
domestics
it
seldom
happens
that
mulattoes
are
in
possession
of
plantations
but
when
a
white
man
dies
who
happens
to
possess
twenty
negroes
he
will
divide
them
among
his
brown
family
leaving
we
may
say
five
to
each
of
his
four
children
these
are
too
few
to
be
employed
in
plantation
work
they
are
therefore
ordered
to
maintain
their
owner
by
some
means
or
other
and
which
means
are
frequently
not
the
most
honest
the
most
frequent
being
the
travelling
about
as
higglers
and
exchanging
the
trumpery
contents
of
their
packs
and
boxes
with
plantation
negroes
for
stolen
rum
and
sugar
i
confess
i
can
not
see
why
on
such
bequest
being
made
the
law
should
not
order
the
negroes
to
be
sold
and
the
produce
of
the
sale
paid
to
the
mulatto
heirs
but
absolutely
prohibiting
the
mulattoes
from
becoming
proprietors
of
the
negroes
themselves
every
man
of
humanity
must
wish
that
slavery
even
in
its
best
and
most
mitigated
form
had
never
found
a
legal
sanction
and
must
regret
that
its
system
is
now
so
incorporated
with
the
welfare
of
great
britain
as
well
as
of
jamaica
as
to
make
its
extirpation
an
absolute
impossibility
without
the
certainty
of
producing
worse
mischiefs
than
the
one
which
we
annihilate
but
certainly
there
can
be
no
sort
of
occasion
for
continuing
in
the
colonies
the
existence
of
which
neither
contributes
to
the
security
of
the
colonies
themselves
nor
to
the
opulence
of
the
the
revenue
of
which
derived
from
colonial
duties
would
suffer
no
defalcation
whatever
even
if
neither
whites
nor
blacks
in
the
west
indies
were
suffered
to
employ
slaves
except
in
plantation
labour
may
i
gave
my
negroes
a
farewell
holiday
on
which
occasion
each
grown
person
received
a
present
of
and
every
child
a
maccaroni
in
return
they
endeavoured
to
express
their
sorrow
for
my
departure
by
eating
and
drinking
dancing
and
singing
with
more
vehemence
and
perseverance
than
on
any
former
occasion
as
in
all
probability
many
years
will
elapse
without
my
making
them
another
visit
if
indeed
i
should
ever
return
at
all
i
have
at
least
exerted
myself
while
here
to
do
everything
which
appeared
likely
to
contribute
to
their
welfare
and
security
during
my
absence
in
particular
my
attorney
has
made
out
a
list
of
all
such
offences
as
are
most
usually
committed
on
plantations
to
which
proportionate
punishments
have
been
affixed
by
myself
from
this
code
of
internal
regulations
the
overseer
is
not
to
be
allowed
to
deviate
and
the
attorney
has
pledged
himself
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
adhere
strictly
to
the
system
laid
down
for
him
by
this
scheme
the
negroes
will
no
longer
be
punished
according
to
the
momentary
caprice
of
their
superintendent
but
by
known
and
fixed
laws
the
one
no
more
than
the
other
and
without
respect
to
partiality
or
prejudice
hitherto
in
everything
which
had
not
been
previously
deter
mined
by
the
public
law
with
a
penalty
attached
to
the
breach
of
it
the
negro
has
been
left
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
the
overseer
who
if
he
was
a
humane
man
punished
him
slightly
and
if
a
tyrant
heavily
nay
very
often
the
quantity
of
punishment
depended
upon
the
time
of
day
when
the
offence
was
made
known
if
accused
in
the
morning
when
the
overseer
was
in
cold
blood
and
in
good
humour
a
night
s
confinement
in
the
stocks
might
be
deemed
sufficient
whereas
if
the
charge
was
brought
when
the
superior
had
taken
his
full
proportion
of
grog
or
sangaree
the
very
same
offence
would
be
visited
with
lashes
i
have
moreover
taken
care
to
settle
all
disputes
respecting
property
having
caused
all
negroes
having
claims
upon
others
to
bring
them
before
my
tribunal
previous
to
my
departure
and
determined
that
from
that
time
forth
no
such
claims
should
be
enquired
into
but
considered
as
definitively
settled
by
my
authority
it
would
have
done
the
lord
chancellor
s
heart
good
to
see
how
many
suits
i
determined
in
the
course
of
a
week
and
with
what
expedition
i
made
a
clear
court
of
chancery
but
perhaps
the
most
astonishing
part
of
the
whole
business
was
that
after
judgment
was
pronounced
the
losers
as
well
as
the
gainers
declared
themselves
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
justice
of
the
sentence
i
must
acknowledge
however
that
the
negro
principle
that
massa
can
do
no
wrong
was
of
some
little
assistance
to
me
on
this
occasion
oh
quite
just
me
good
massa
what
massa
say
quite
just
me
no
say
nothing
more
me
good
massa
then
they
thanked
me
for
massa
s
goodness
in
giving
them
so
long
talk
and
went
away
to
tell
all
the
others
how
just
massa
had
been
in
taking
away
what
they
wanted
to
keep
or
not
giving
them
what
they
asked
it
must
be
owned
that
this
is
not
the
usual
mode
of
proceeding
after
the
loss
of
a
chancery
suit
in
england
but
to
do
the
negroes
mere
justice
i
must
say
that
i
could
not
have
wished
to
find
a
more
tractable
set
of
people
on
almost
every
occasion
some
lazy
and
obstinate
persons
of
course
there
must
inevitably
be
in
so
great
a
number
but
in
general
i
found
them
excellently
disposed
and
being
once
thoroughly
convinced
of
my
real
towards
them
they
were
willing
to
take
it
for
granted
that
my
regulations
must
be
right
and
beneficial
even
in
cases
where
they
were
in
opposition
to
individual
interests
and
popular
prejudices
my
attorney
had
mentioned
to
me
several
points
which
he
thought
it
advisable
to
have
altered
but
which
he
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
accomplish
thus
the
negroes
were
in
the
practice
of
bequeathing
their
houses
and
grounds
by
which
means
some
of
them
were
become
owners
of
several
houses
and
numerous
gardens
in
the
village
while
others
with
large
families
were
either
inadequately
provided
for
or
not
provided
for
at
all
i
made
it
public
that
from
henceforth
no
negro
should
possess
more
than
one
house
with
a
sufficient
portion
of
ground
for
his
family
and
on
the
following
sunday
the
overseer
by
my
order
looked
over
the
village
took
from
those
who
had
too
much
to
give
to
those
who
had
too
little
and
made
an
entire
new
distribution
according
to
the
most
strict
agrarian
law
those
who
lost
by
this
measure
came
the
next
day
to
complain
to
me
when
i
avowed
its
having
been
done
by
my
order
and
explained
the
propriety
of
the
proceeding
after
which
they
declared
themselves
contented
and
i
never
heard
another
murmur
on
the
subject
again
mothers
being
allowed
certain
indulgences
while
suckling
persist
in
it
for
two
years
and
upwards
to
the
great
detriment
both
of
themselves
and
their
children
complaint
of
this
being
made
to
me
i
sent
for
the
mothers
and
told
them
that
every
child
must
be
sent
to
the
on
the
first
day
of
the
fifteenth
month
but
that
their
indulgences
should
be
continued
to
the
mothers
for
two
months
longer
although
the
children
would
be
no
longer
with
them
all
who
had
children
of
that
age
immediately
gave
them
up
the
rest
promised
to
do
so
when
they
should
be
old
enough
and
they
all
thanked
me
for
the
continuance
of
their
indulgences
which
they
considered
as
a
boon
newly
granted
them
on
my
return
from
hordley
i
was
told
that
the
negroes
suffered
their
pigs
to
infest
the
works
and
grounds
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
house
in
such
numbers
that
they
were
become
a
perfect
nuisance
nor
could
any
remonstrance
prevail
on
them
to
confine
the
animals
within
the
village
an
order
was
in
consequence
issued
on
a
saturday
that
the
first
four
pigs
found
rambling
at
large
after
two
days
should
be
put
to
death
without
mercy
and
accordingly
on
monday
morning
at
the
negro
breakfast
hour
the
head
governor
made
his
appearance
before
the
house
armed
with
a
lance
in
his
hand
and
an
enormous
cutlass
by
his
side
the
news
of
this
tremendous
apparition
spread
through
the
estate
like
wildfire
instantly
all
was
in
an
uproar
the
negroes
came
pouring
down
from
all
quarters
in
an
instant
the
whole
air
was
rent
with
noises
of
all
kinds
and
creatures
men
women
and
children
shouting
and
bellowing
geese
cackling
dogs
barking
turkeys
gobbling
and
look
where
you
would
there
was
a
negro
running
along
as
fast
as
he
could
and
dragging
a
pig
along
with
him
by
one
of
the
hind
legs
while
the
pigs
were
all
astonishment
at
this
sudden
attack
and
called
upon
heaven
and
earth
for
commiseration
and
protection
with
many
a
doleful
grunt
and
piteous
squeak
poor
pigs
as
if
their
pretty
hearts
would
break
from
thenceforth
not
a
pig
except
my
own
was
to
be
seen
about
the
place
yet
instead
of
complaining
of
this
restraint
several
of
the
negroes
came
to
assure
me
that
i
might
depend
on
the
animals
not
being
suffered
to
stray
beyond
the
village
for
the
future
and
to
thank
me
for
having
given
them
the
warning
two
days
before
what
other
negroes
may
be
i
will
not
pretend
to
guess
but
i
am
certain
that
there
can
not
be
more
tractable
or
better
disposed
persons
take
them
for
all
in
all
than
my
negroes
of
cornwall
i
only
wish
that
in
my
future
dealings
with
white
persons
whether
jamaica
or
out
of
it
i
could
but
meet
with
half
so
much
gratitude
affection
and
the
end
