chapter
i
of
golden
walter
and
his
father
awhile
ago
there
was
a
young
man
dwelling
in
a
great
and
goodly
city
by
the
sea
which
had
to
name
langton
on
holm
he
was
but
of
five
and
twenty
winters
a
man
tall
and
strong
rather
wiser
than
foolisher
than
young
men
are
mostly
wont
a
valiant
youth
and
a
kind
not
of
many
words
but
courteous
of
speech
no
roisterer
nought
masterful
but
peaceable
and
knowing
how
to
forbear
in
a
fray
a
perilous
foe
and
a
trusty
his
father
with
whom
he
was
dwelling
when
this
tale
begins
was
a
great
merchant
richer
than
a
baron
of
the
land
a
of
the
greatest
of
the
lineages
of
langton
and
a
captain
of
the
porte
he
was
of
the
lineage
of
the
goldings
therefore
was
he
called
bartholomew
golden
and
his
son
golden
walter
now
ye
may
well
deem
that
such
a
youngling
as
this
was
looked
upon
by
all
as
a
lucky
man
without
a
lack
but
there
was
this
flaw
in
his
lot
whereas
he
had
fallen
into
the
toils
of
love
of
a
woman
exceeding
fair
and
had
taken
her
to
wife
she
nought
unwilling
as
it
seemed
but
when
they
had
been
wedded
some
six
months
he
found
by
manifest
tokens
that
his
fairness
was
not
so
much
to
her
but
that
she
must
seek
to
the
foulness
of
one
worser
than
he
in
all
ways
wherefore
his
rest
departed
from
him
whereas
he
hated
her
for
her
untruth
and
her
hatred
of
him
yet
would
the
sound
of
her
voice
as
she
came
and
went
in
the
house
make
his
heart
beat
and
the
sight
of
her
stirred
desire
within
him
so
that
he
longed
for
her
to
be
sweet
and
kind
with
him
and
deemed
that
might
it
be
so
he
should
forget
all
the
evil
gone
by
but
it
was
not
so
for
ever
when
she
saw
him
her
face
changed
and
her
hatred
of
him
became
manifest
and
howsoever
she
were
sweet
with
others
with
him
she
was
hard
and
sour
so
this
went
on
a
while
till
the
chambers
of
his
father
house
yea
the
very
streets
of
the
city
became
loathsome
to
him
and
yet
he
called
to
mind
that
the
world
was
wide
and
he
but
a
young
man
so
on
a
day
as
he
sat
with
his
father
alone
he
spake
to
him
and
said
father
i
was
on
the
quays
even
now
and
i
looked
on
the
ships
that
were
nigh
boun
and
thy
sign
i
saw
on
a
tall
ship
that
seemed
to
me
nighest
boun
will
it
be
long
ere
she
sail
nay
said
his
father
that
ship
which
hight
the
katherine
will
they
warp
out
of
the
haven
in
two
days
time
but
why
askest
thou
of
her
the
shortest
word
is
best
father
said
walter
and
this
it
is
that
i
would
depart
in
the
said
ship
and
see
other
lands
yea
and
whither
son
said
the
merchant
whither
she
goeth
said
walter
for
i
am
ill
at
ease
at
home
as
thou
wottest
father
the
merchant
held
his
peace
awhile
and
looked
hard
on
his
son
for
there
was
strong
love
between
them
but
at
last
he
said
well
son
maybe
it
were
best
for
thee
but
maybe
also
we
shall
not
meet
again
yet
if
we
do
meet
father
then
shalt
thou
see
a
new
man
in
me
well
said
bartholomew
at
least
i
know
on
whom
to
lay
the
loss
of
thee
and
when
thou
art
gone
for
thou
shalt
have
thine
own
way
herein
she
shall
no
longer
abide
in
my
house
nay
but
it
were
for
the
strife
that
should
arise
thenceforth
betwixt
her
kindred
and
ours
it
should
go
somewhat
worse
with
her
than
that
said
walter
i
pray
thee
shame
her
not
more
than
needs
must
be
lest
so
doing
thou
shame
both
me
and
thyself
also
bartholomew
held
his
peace
again
for
a
while
then
he
said
goeth
she
with
child
my
son
walter
reddened
and
said
i
wot
not
nor
of
whom
the
child
may
be
then
they
both
sat
silent
till
bartholomew
spake
saying
the
end
of
it
is
son
that
this
is
monday
and
that
thou
shalt
go
aboard
in
the
small
hours
of
wednesday
and
meanwhile
i
shall
look
to
it
that
thou
go
not
away
the
skipper
of
the
katherine
is
a
good
man
and
true
and
knows
the
seas
well
and
my
servant
robert
the
low
who
is
clerk
of
the
lading
is
trustworthy
and
wise
and
as
myself
in
all
matters
that
look
towards
chaffer
the
katherine
is
new
and
and
should
be
lucky
whereas
she
is
under
the
ward
of
her
who
is
the
saint
called
upon
in
the
church
where
thou
wert
christened
and
myself
before
thee
and
thy
mother
and
my
father
and
mother
all
lie
under
the
chancel
thereof
as
thou
wottest
therewith
the
elder
rose
up
and
went
his
ways
about
his
business
and
there
was
no
more
said
betwixt
him
and
his
son
on
this
matter
chapter
ii
golden
walter
takes
ship
to
sail
the
seas
when
walter
went
down
to
the
katherine
next
morning
there
was
the
skipper
geoffrey
who
did
him
reverence
and
made
him
all
cheer
and
showed
him
his
room
aboard
ship
and
the
plenteous
goods
which
his
father
had
sent
down
to
the
quays
already
such
haste
as
he
had
made
walter
thanked
his
father
love
in
his
heart
but
otherwise
took
little
heed
to
his
affairs
but
wore
away
the
time
about
the
haven
gazing
listlessly
on
the
ships
that
were
making
them
ready
outward
or
unlading
and
the
mariners
and
aliens
coming
and
going
and
all
these
were
to
him
as
the
curious
images
woven
on
a
tapestry
at
last
when
he
had
wellnigh
come
back
again
to
the
katherine
he
saw
there
a
tall
ship
which
he
had
scarce
noted
before
a
ship
which
had
her
boats
out
and
men
sitting
to
the
oars
thereof
ready
to
tow
her
outwards
when
the
hawser
should
be
cast
off
and
by
seeming
her
mariners
were
but
abiding
for
some
one
or
other
to
come
aboard
so
walter
stood
idly
watching
the
said
ship
and
as
he
looked
lo
folk
passing
him
toward
the
gangway
these
were
three
first
came
a
dwarf
of
hue
and
hideous
with
long
arms
and
ears
exceeding
great
and
that
stuck
out
like
the
fangs
of
a
wild
beast
he
was
clad
in
a
rich
coat
of
yellow
silk
and
bare
in
his
hand
a
crooked
bow
and
was
girt
with
a
broad
sax
after
him
came
a
maiden
young
by
seeming
of
scarce
twenty
summers
fair
of
face
as
a
flower
with
lips
full
and
red
slim
and
gentle
of
body
simple
was
her
array
of
a
short
and
strait
green
gown
so
that
on
her
right
ankle
was
clear
to
see
an
iron
ring
last
of
the
three
was
a
lady
tall
and
stately
so
radiant
of
visage
and
glorious
of
raiment
that
it
were
hard
to
say
what
like
she
was
for
scarce
might
the
eye
gaze
steady
upon
her
exceeding
beauty
yet
must
every
son
of
adam
who
found
himself
anigh
her
lift
up
his
eyes
again
after
he
had
dropped
them
and
look
again
on
her
and
yet
again
and
yet
again
even
so
did
walter
and
as
the
three
passed
by
him
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
all
the
other
folk
there
about
had
vanished
and
were
nought
nor
had
he
any
vision
before
his
eyes
of
any
looking
on
them
save
himself
alone
they
went
over
the
gangway
into
the
ship
and
he
saw
them
go
along
the
deck
till
they
came
to
the
house
on
the
poop
and
entered
it
and
were
gone
from
his
sight
there
he
stood
staring
till
little
by
little
the
thronging
people
of
the
quays
came
into
his
again
then
he
saw
how
the
hawser
was
cast
off
and
the
boats
fell
to
tugging
the
big
ship
toward
the
with
hale
and
how
of
men
then
the
sail
fell
down
from
the
yard
and
was
sheeted
home
and
filled
with
the
fair
wind
as
the
ship
bows
ran
up
on
the
first
green
wave
outside
the
haven
even
therewith
the
shipmen
cast
abroad
a
banner
whereon
was
done
in
a
green
field
a
grim
wolf
ramping
up
against
a
maiden
and
so
went
the
ship
upon
her
way
walter
stood
awhile
staring
at
her
empty
place
where
the
waves
ran
into
the
and
then
turned
aside
and
toward
the
katherine
and
at
first
he
was
minded
to
go
ask
shipmaster
geoffrey
of
what
he
knew
concerning
the
said
ship
and
her
alien
wayfarers
but
then
it
came
into
his
mind
that
all
this
was
but
an
imagination
or
dream
of
the
day
and
that
he
were
best
to
leave
it
untold
to
any
so
therewith
he
went
his
way
from
the
and
through
the
streets
unto
his
father
house
but
when
he
was
but
a
little
way
thence
and
the
door
was
before
him
seemed
for
a
moment
of
time
that
he
beheld
those
three
coming
out
down
the
steps
of
stone
and
into
the
street
to
wit
the
dwarf
the
maiden
and
the
stately
lady
but
when
he
stood
still
to
abide
their
coming
and
looked
toward
them
lo
there
was
nothing
before
him
save
the
goodly
house
of
bartholomew
golden
and
three
children
and
a
cur
dog
playing
about
the
steps
thereof
and
about
him
were
four
or
five
going
about
their
business
then
was
he
all
confused
in
his
mind
and
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
whether
those
whom
he
had
seemed
to
see
pass
aboard
ship
were
but
images
of
a
dream
or
children
of
adam
in
very
flesh
howsoever
he
entered
the
house
and
found
his
father
in
the
chamber
and
fell
to
speech
with
him
about
their
matters
but
for
all
that
he
loved
his
father
and
worshipped
him
as
a
wise
and
valiant
man
yet
at
that
hour
he
might
not
hearken
the
words
of
his
mouth
so
much
was
his
mind
entangled
in
the
thought
of
those
three
and
they
were
ever
before
his
eyes
as
if
they
had
been
painted
on
a
table
by
the
best
of
limners
and
of
the
two
women
he
thought
exceeding
much
and
cast
no
wyte
upon
himself
for
running
after
the
desire
of
strange
women
for
he
said
to
himself
that
he
desired
not
either
of
the
twain
nay
he
might
not
tell
which
of
the
twain
the
maiden
or
the
stately
queen
were
clearest
to
his
eyes
but
sore
he
desired
to
see
both
of
them
again
and
to
know
what
they
were
so
wore
the
hours
till
the
wednesday
morning
and
it
was
time
that
he
should
bid
farewell
to
his
father
and
get
aboard
ship
but
his
father
led
him
down
to
the
quays
and
on
to
the
katherine
and
there
walter
embraced
him
not
without
tears
and
forebodings
for
his
heart
was
full
then
presently
the
old
man
went
aland
the
gangway
was
unshipped
the
hawsers
cast
off
the
oars
of
the
splashed
in
the
dark
water
the
sail
fell
down
from
the
yard
and
was
sheeted
home
and
out
plunged
the
katherine
into
the
misty
sea
and
rolled
up
the
grey
slopes
casting
abroad
her
ancient
withal
whereon
was
beaten
the
token
of
bartholomew
golden
to
wit
a
b
and
a
g
to
the
right
and
the
left
and
thereabove
a
cross
and
a
triangle
rising
from
the
midst
walter
stood
on
the
stern
and
beheld
yet
more
with
the
mind
of
him
than
with
his
eyes
for
it
all
seemed
but
the
double
of
what
the
other
ship
had
done
and
the
thought
of
it
as
if
the
twain
were
as
beads
strung
on
one
string
and
led
away
by
it
into
the
same
place
and
thence
to
go
in
the
like
order
and
so
on
again
and
again
and
never
to
draw
nigher
to
each
other
chapter
iii
walter
heareth
tidings
of
the
death
of
his
father
fast
sailed
the
katherine
over
the
seas
and
nought
befell
to
tell
of
either
to
herself
or
her
crew
she
came
to
one
and
then
to
another
and
so
on
to
a
third
and
a
fourth
and
at
each
was
buying
and
selling
after
the
manner
of
chapmen
and
walter
not
only
looked
on
the
doings
of
his
father
folk
but
lent
a
hand
what
he
might
to
help
them
in
all
matters
whether
it
were
in
seaman
craft
or
in
chaffer
and
the
further
he
went
and
the
longer
the
time
wore
the
more
he
was
eased
of
his
old
trouble
wherein
his
wife
and
her
treason
had
to
do
but
as
for
the
other
trouble
to
wit
his
desire
and
longing
to
come
up
with
those
three
it
yet
flickered
before
him
and
though
he
had
not
seen
them
again
as
one
sees
people
in
the
streets
and
as
if
he
might
touch
them
if
he
would
yet
were
their
images
often
before
his
mind
eye
and
yet
as
time
wore
not
so
often
nor
so
troublously
and
forsooth
both
to
those
about
him
and
to
himself
he
seemed
as
a
man
well
healed
of
his
melancholy
mood
now
they
left
that
fourth
stead
and
sailed
over
the
seas
and
came
to
a
fifth
a
very
great
and
fair
city
which
they
had
made
more
than
seven
months
from
langton
on
holm
and
by
this
time
was
walter
taking
heed
and
joyance
in
such
things
as
were
toward
in
that
fair
city
so
far
from
his
kindred
and
especially
he
looked
on
the
fair
women
there
and
desired
them
and
loved
them
but
lightly
as
befalleth
young
men
now
this
was
the
last
country
whereto
the
katherine
was
boun
so
there
they
abode
some
ten
months
in
daily
chaffer
and
in
pleasuring
them
in
beholding
all
that
there
was
of
rare
and
goodly
and
making
merry
with
the
merchants
and
the
and
the
beyond
the
gates
and
walter
was
grown
as
busy
and
gay
as
a
strong
young
man
is
like
to
be
and
was
as
one
who
would
fain
be
of
some
account
amongst
his
own
folk
but
at
the
end
of
this
while
it
befell
on
a
day
as
he
was
leaving
his
hostel
for
his
booth
in
the
market
and
had
the
door
in
his
hand
there
stood
before
him
three
mariners
in
the
guise
of
his
own
country
and
with
them
was
one
of
clerkly
aspect
whom
he
knew
at
once
for
his
scrivener
arnold
penstrong
by
name
and
when
walter
saw
him
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
cried
out
arnold
what
tidings
is
all
well
with
the
folk
at
langton
said
arnold
evil
tidings
are
come
with
me
matters
are
ill
with
thy
folk
for
i
may
not
hide
that
thy
father
bartholomew
golden
is
dead
god
rest
his
soul
at
that
word
it
was
to
walter
as
if
all
that
trouble
which
but
now
had
sat
so
light
upon
him
was
once
again
fresh
and
heavy
and
that
his
past
life
of
the
last
few
months
had
never
been
and
it
was
to
him
as
if
he
saw
his
father
lying
dead
on
his
bed
and
heard
the
folk
lamenting
about
the
house
he
held
his
peace
awhile
and
then
he
said
in
a
voice
as
of
an
angry
man
what
arnold
and
did
he
die
in
his
bed
or
how
for
he
was
neither
old
nor
ailing
when
we
parted
said
arnold
yea
in
his
bed
he
died
but
first
he
was
somewhat
bitten
yea
and
how
quoth
walter
said
arnold
when
thou
wert
gone
in
a
few
days
wearing
thy
father
sent
thy
wife
out
of
his
house
back
to
her
kindred
of
the
reddings
with
no
honour
and
yet
with
no
such
shame
as
might
have
been
without
blame
to
us
of
those
who
knew
the
tale
of
thee
and
her
which
will
be
pretty
much
the
whole
of
the
city
nevertheless
the
reddings
took
it
amiss
and
would
have
a
mote
with
us
goldings
to
talk
of
booting
by
we
that
for
the
saving
of
the
city
peace
but
what
betid
we
met
in
our
and
there
befell
the
talk
between
us
and
in
that
talk
certain
words
could
not
be
hidden
though
they
were
none
too
seemly
nor
too
meek
and
the
said
words
once
spoken
drew
forth
the
whetted
steel
and
there
then
was
the
hewing
and
thrusting
two
of
ours
were
slain
outright
on
the
floor
and
four
of
theirs
and
many
were
hurt
on
either
side
of
these
was
thy
father
for
as
thou
mayst
well
deem
he
was
nought
backward
in
the
fray
but
despite
his
hurts
two
in
the
side
and
one
on
the
arm
he
went
home
on
his
own
feet
and
we
deemed
that
we
had
come
to
our
above
but
way
it
was
an
evil
victory
whereas
in
ten
days
he
died
of
his
hurts
god
have
his
soul
but
now
my
master
thou
mayst
well
wot
that
i
am
not
come
to
tell
thee
this
only
but
moreover
to
bear
the
word
of
the
kindred
to
wit
that
thou
come
back
with
me
straightway
in
the
swift
cutter
which
hath
borne
me
and
the
tidings
and
thou
mayst
look
to
it
that
though
she
be
swift
and
light
she
is
a
keel
full
weatherly
then
said
walter
this
is
a
bidding
of
war
come
back
will
i
and
the
reddings
shall
wot
of
my
coming
are
ye
yea
said
arnold
we
may
up
anchor
this
very
day
or
morn
at
latest
but
what
aileth
thee
master
that
thou
starest
so
wild
over
my
shoulder
i
pray
thee
take
it
not
so
much
to
heart
ever
it
is
the
wont
of
fathers
to
depart
this
world
before
their
sons
but
walter
visage
from
wrathful
red
had
become
pale
and
he
pointed
up
street
and
cried
out
look
dost
thou
see
see
what
master
quoth
arnold
what
here
cometh
an
ape
in
gay
raiment
belike
the
beast
of
some
jongleur
nay
by
god
wounds
is
a
man
though
he
be
exceeding
like
a
very
devil
yea
and
now
there
cometh
a
pretty
maid
going
as
if
she
were
of
his
meney
and
lo
here
a
most
goodly
and
noble
lady
yea
i
see
and
doubtless
she
owneth
both
the
two
and
is
of
the
greatest
of
the
folk
of
this
fair
city
for
on
the
maiden
ankle
i
saw
an
iron
ring
which
betokeneth
thralldom
amongst
these
aliens
but
this
is
strange
for
notest
thou
not
how
the
folk
in
the
street
heed
not
this
quaint
show
nay
not
even
the
stately
lady
though
she
be
as
lovely
as
a
goddess
of
the
gentiles
and
beareth
on
her
gems
that
would
buy
langton
twice
over
surely
they
must
be
wont
to
strange
and
gallant
sights
but
now
master
but
now
yea
what
is
it
said
walter
why
master
they
should
not
yet
be
gone
out
of
yet
gone
they
are
what
is
become
of
them
are
they
sunk
into
the
earth
tush
man
said
walter
looking
not
on
arnold
but
still
staring
down
the
street
they
have
gone
into
some
house
while
thine
eyes
were
turned
from
them
a
moment
nay
master
nay
said
arnold
mine
eyes
were
not
off
them
one
instant
of
time
well
said
walter
somewhat
snappishly
they
are
gone
now
and
what
have
we
to
do
to
heed
such
toys
we
with
all
this
grief
and
strife
on
our
hands
now
would
i
be
alone
to
turn
the
matter
of
thine
errand
over
in
my
mind
meantime
do
thou
tell
the
shipmaster
geoffrey
and
our
other
folk
of
these
tidings
and
thereafter
get
thee
all
ready
and
come
hither
to
me
before
sunrise
and
i
shall
be
ready
for
my
part
and
so
sail
we
back
to
langton
therewith
he
turned
him
back
into
the
house
and
the
others
went
their
ways
but
walter
sat
alone
in
his
chamber
a
long
while
and
pondered
these
things
in
his
mind
and
whiles
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
think
no
more
of
the
vision
of
those
three
but
would
fare
back
to
langton
and
enter
into
the
strife
with
the
reddings
and
quell
them
or
die
else
but
lo
when
he
was
quite
steady
in
this
doom
and
his
heart
was
lightened
thereby
he
found
that
he
thought
no
more
of
the
reddings
and
their
strife
but
as
matters
that
were
passed
and
done
with
and
that
now
he
was
thinking
and
devising
if
by
any
means
he
might
find
out
in
what
land
dwelt
those
three
and
then
again
he
strove
to
put
that
from
him
saying
that
what
he
had
seen
was
but
meet
for
one
brainsick
and
a
dreamer
of
dreams
but
furthermore
he
thought
yea
and
was
arnold
who
this
last
time
had
seen
the
images
of
those
three
a
dreamer
of
waking
dreams
for
he
was
nought
wonted
in
such
wise
then
thought
he
at
least
i
am
well
content
that
he
spake
to
me
of
their
likeness
not
i
to
him
for
so
i
may
tell
that
there
was
at
least
something
before
my
eyes
which
grew
not
out
of
mine
own
brain
and
yet
again
why
should
i
follow
them
and
what
should
i
get
by
it
and
indeed
how
shall
i
set
about
it
thus
he
turned
the
matter
over
and
over
and
at
last
seeing
that
if
he
grew
no
foolisher
over
it
he
grew
no
wiser
he
became
weary
thereof
and
bestirred
him
and
saw
to
the
trussing
up
of
his
goods
and
made
all
ready
for
his
departure
and
so
wore
the
day
and
slept
at
nightfall
and
at
daybreak
comes
arnold
to
lead
him
to
their
keel
which
hight
the
bartholomew
he
tarried
nought
and
with
few
farewells
went
aboard
ship
and
an
hour
after
they
were
in
the
open
sea
with
the
ship
head
turned
toward
langton
on
holm
chapter
iv
storm
befalls
the
bartholomew
and
she
is
driven
off
her
course
now
swift
sailed
the
bartholomew
for
four
weeks
toward
the
with
a
fair
wind
and
all
was
well
with
ship
and
crew
then
the
wind
died
out
on
even
of
a
day
so
that
the
ship
scarce
made
way
at
all
though
she
rolled
in
a
great
swell
of
the
sea
so
great
that
it
seemed
to
ridge
all
the
main
athwart
moreover
down
in
the
west
was
a
great
bank
of
cloud
huddled
up
in
haze
whereas
for
twenty
days
past
the
sky
had
been
clear
save
for
a
few
bright
white
clouds
flying
before
the
wind
now
the
shipmaster
a
man
right
cunning
in
his
craft
looked
long
on
sea
and
sky
and
then
turned
and
bade
the
mariners
take
in
sail
and
be
right
heedful
and
when
walter
asked
him
what
he
looked
for
and
wherefore
he
spake
not
to
him
thereof
he
said
surlily
why
should
i
tell
thee
what
any
fool
can
see
without
telling
to
wit
that
there
is
weather
to
hand
so
they
abode
what
should
befall
and
walter
went
to
his
room
to
sleep
away
the
uneasy
while
for
the
night
was
now
fallen
and
he
knew
no
more
till
he
was
waked
up
by
great
hubbub
and
clamour
of
the
shipmen
and
the
whipping
of
ropes
and
thunder
of
flapping
sails
and
the
tossing
and
weltering
of
the
ship
withal
but
being
a
very
young
man
he
lay
still
in
his
room
partly
because
he
was
a
landsman
and
had
no
mind
to
tumble
about
amongst
the
shipmen
and
hinder
them
and
withal
he
said
to
himself
what
matter
whether
i
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
or
come
back
to
langton
since
either
way
my
life
or
my
death
will
take
away
from
me
the
fulfilment
of
desire
yet
soothly
if
there
hath
been
a
shift
of
wind
that
is
not
so
ill
for
then
shall
we
be
driven
to
other
lands
and
so
at
the
least
our
shall
be
delayed
and
other
tidings
may
hap
amidst
of
our
tarrying
so
let
all
be
as
it
will
so
in
a
little
while
in
spite
of
the
ship
wallowing
and
the
tumult
of
the
wind
and
waves
he
fell
asleep
again
and
woke
no
more
till
it
was
full
daylight
and
there
was
the
shipmaster
standing
in
the
door
of
his
room
the
all
streaming
from
his
raiment
he
said
to
walter
young
master
the
sele
of
the
day
to
thee
for
by
good
hap
we
have
gotten
into
another
day
now
i
shall
tell
thee
that
we
have
striven
to
beat
so
as
not
to
be
driven
off
our
course
but
all
would
not
avail
wherefore
for
these
three
hours
we
have
been
running
before
the
wind
but
fair
sir
so
big
hath
been
the
sea
that
but
for
our
ship
being
of
the
stoutest
and
our
men
all
yare
we
had
all
grown
exceeding
wise
concerning
the
ground
of
the
praise
be
to
nicholas
and
all
hallows
for
though
ye
shall
presently
look
upon
a
new
sea
and
maybe
a
new
land
to
boot
yet
is
that
better
than
looking
on
the
ugly
things
down
below
is
all
well
with
ship
and
crew
then
said
walter
yea
forsooth
said
the
shipmaster
verily
the
bartholomew
is
the
darling
of
oak
woods
come
up
and
look
at
it
how
she
is
dealing
with
wind
and
waves
all
free
from
fear
so
walter
did
on
his
raiment
and
went
up
on
to
the
deck
and
there
indeed
was
a
change
of
days
for
the
sea
was
dark
and
tumbling
and
the
were
running
down
the
valleys
thereof
and
the
clouds
drave
low
over
all
and
bore
a
scud
of
rain
along
with
them
and
though
there
was
but
a
rag
of
sail
on
her
the
ship
flew
before
the
wind
rolling
a
great
wash
of
water
from
bulwark
to
bulwark
walter
stood
looking
on
it
all
awhile
holding
on
by
a
and
saying
to
himself
that
it
was
well
that
they
were
driving
so
fast
toward
new
things
then
the
shipmaster
came
up
to
him
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said
well
shipmate
cheer
up
and
now
come
below
again
and
eat
some
meat
and
drink
a
cup
with
me
so
walter
went
down
and
ate
and
drank
and
his
heart
was
lighter
than
it
had
been
since
he
had
heard
of
his
father
death
and
the
feud
awaiting
him
at
home
which
forsooth
he
had
deemed
would
stay
his
wanderings
a
weary
while
and
therewithal
his
hopes
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
he
needs
must
wander
would
he
would
he
not
and
so
it
was
that
even
this
fed
his
hope
so
sore
his
heart
clung
to
that
desire
of
his
to
seek
home
to
those
three
that
seemed
to
call
him
unto
them
chapter
v
now
they
come
to
a
new
land
three
days
they
drave
before
the
wind
and
on
the
fourth
the
clouds
lifted
the
sun
shone
out
and
the
offing
was
clear
the
wind
had
much
abated
though
it
still
blew
a
breeze
and
was
a
head
wind
for
sailing
toward
the
country
of
langton
so
then
the
master
said
that
since
they
were
bewildered
and
the
wind
so
ill
to
deal
with
it
were
best
to
go
still
before
the
wind
that
they
might
make
some
land
and
get
knowledge
of
their
whereabouts
from
the
folk
thereof
withal
he
said
that
he
deemed
the
land
not
to
be
very
far
distant
so
did
they
and
sailed
on
pleasantly
enough
for
the
weather
kept
on
mending
and
the
wind
fell
till
it
was
but
a
light
breeze
yet
still
foul
for
langton
so
wore
three
days
and
on
the
eve
of
the
third
the
man
from
the
topmast
cried
out
that
he
saw
land
ahead
and
so
did
they
all
before
the
sun
was
quite
set
though
it
were
but
a
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
when
night
fell
they
struck
not
sail
but
went
forth
toward
the
land
fair
and
softly
for
it
was
early
summer
so
that
the
nights
were
neither
long
nor
dark
but
when
it
was
broad
daylight
they
opened
a
land
a
long
shore
of
rocks
and
mountains
and
nought
else
that
they
could
see
at
first
nevertheless
as
day
wore
and
they
drew
nigher
first
they
saw
how
the
mountains
fell
away
from
the
sea
and
were
behind
a
long
wall
of
sheer
cliff
and
coming
nigher
yet
they
beheld
a
green
plain
going
up
after
a
little
in
green
bents
and
slopes
to
the
feet
of
the
said
no
city
nor
haven
did
they
see
there
not
even
when
they
were
far
nigher
to
the
land
nevertheless
whereas
they
hankered
for
the
peace
of
the
green
earth
after
all
the
tossing
and
unrest
of
the
sea
and
whereas
also
they
doubted
not
to
find
at
the
least
good
and
fresh
water
and
belike
other
bait
in
the
plain
under
the
mountains
they
still
sailed
on
not
unmerrily
so
that
by
nightfall
they
cast
anchor
in
water
hard
by
the
shore
next
morning
they
found
that
they
were
lying
a
little
way
off
the
mouth
of
a
river
not
right
great
so
they
put
out
their
boats
and
towed
the
ship
up
into
the
said
river
and
when
they
had
gone
up
it
for
a
mile
or
thereabouts
they
found
the
sea
water
failed
for
little
was
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
on
that
coast
then
was
the
river
deep
and
clear
running
between
smooth
grassy
land
like
to
meadows
also
on
their
left
board
they
saw
presently
three
head
of
neat
cattle
going
as
if
in
a
meadow
of
a
homestead
in
their
own
land
and
a
few
sheep
and
thereafter
about
a
from
the
river
they
saw
a
little
house
of
wood
and
under
a
wooded
mound
and
with
orchard
trees
about
it
they
wondered
little
thereat
for
they
knew
no
cause
why
that
land
should
not
be
builded
though
it
were
in
the
far
outlands
however
they
drew
their
ship
up
to
the
bank
thinking
that
they
would
at
least
abide
awhile
and
ask
tidings
and
have
some
refreshing
of
the
green
plain
which
was
so
lovely
and
pleasant
but
while
they
were
busied
herein
they
saw
a
man
come
out
of
the
house
and
down
to
the
river
to
meet
them
and
they
soon
saw
that
he
was
tall
and
old
of
hair
and
beard
and
clad
mostly
in
the
skins
of
beasts
he
drew
nigh
without
any
fear
or
mistrust
and
coming
close
to
them
gave
them
the
sele
of
the
day
in
a
kindly
and
pleasant
voice
the
shipmaster
greeted
him
in
his
turn
and
said
withal
old
man
art
thou
the
king
of
this
country
the
elder
laughed
it
hath
had
none
other
a
long
while
said
he
and
at
least
there
is
no
other
son
of
adam
here
to
gainsay
thou
art
alone
here
then
said
the
master
yea
said
the
old
man
save
for
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
wood
and
the
creeping
things
and
fowl
wherefore
it
is
sweet
to
me
to
hear
your
voices
said
the
master
where
be
the
other
houses
of
the
town
the
old
man
laughed
said
he
when
i
said
that
i
was
alone
i
meant
that
i
was
alone
in
the
land
and
not
only
alone
in
this
stead
there
is
no
house
save
this
betwixt
the
sea
and
the
dwellings
of
the
bears
over
the
yonder
yea
and
a
long
way
over
it
yea
quoth
the
shipmaster
grinning
and
be
the
bears
of
thy
country
so
manlike
that
they
dwell
in
builded
houses
the
old
man
shook
his
head
sir
said
he
as
to
their
bodily
fashion
it
is
altogether
manlike
save
that
they
be
one
and
all
higher
and
bigger
than
most
for
they
be
bears
only
in
name
they
be
a
nation
of
half
wild
men
for
i
have
been
told
by
them
that
there
be
many
more
than
that
tribe
whose
folk
i
have
seen
and
that
they
spread
wide
about
behind
these
mountains
from
east
to
west
now
sir
as
to
their
souls
and
understandings
i
warrant
them
not
for
miscreants
they
be
trowing
neither
in
god
nor
his
hallows
said
the
master
trow
they
in
mahound
then
nay
said
the
elder
i
wot
not
for
sure
that
they
have
so
much
as
a
false
god
though
i
have
it
from
them
that
they
worship
a
certain
woman
with
mickle
worship
then
spake
walter
yea
good
sir
and
how
knowest
thou
that
dost
thou
deal
with
them
at
all
said
the
old
man
whiles
some
of
that
folk
come
hither
and
have
of
me
what
i
can
spare
a
calf
or
two
or
a
of
lambs
or
hoggets
or
a
skin
of
wine
or
cyder
of
mine
own
making
and
they
give
me
in
return
such
things
as
i
can
use
as
skins
of
hart
and
bear
and
other
peltries
for
now
i
am
old
i
can
but
little
of
the
hunting
hereabout
whiles
also
they
bring
little
lumps
of
pure
copper
and
would
give
me
gold
also
but
it
is
of
little
use
in
this
lonely
land
sooth
to
say
to
me
they
are
not
masterful
or
but
glad
am
i
that
they
have
been
here
but
of
late
and
are
not
like
to
come
again
this
while
for
terrible
they
are
of
aspect
and
whereas
ye
be
aliens
belike
they
would
not
hold
their
hands
from
off
you
and
moreover
ye
have
weapons
and
other
matters
which
they
would
covet
sorely
quoth
the
master
since
thou
dealest
with
these
wild
men
will
ye
not
deal
with
us
in
chaffer
for
whereas
we
are
come
from
long
travel
we
hanker
after
fresh
victual
and
here
aboard
are
many
things
which
were
for
thine
avail
said
the
old
man
all
that
i
have
is
yours
so
that
ye
do
but
leave
me
enough
till
my
next
ingathering
of
wine
and
cyder
such
as
it
is
i
have
plenty
for
your
service
ye
may
drink
it
till
it
is
all
gone
if
ye
will
a
little
corn
and
meal
i
have
but
not
much
yet
are
ye
welcome
thereto
since
the
standing
corn
in
my
garth
is
done
blossoming
and
i
have
other
meat
cheeses
have
i
and
dried
fish
take
what
ye
will
thereof
but
as
to
my
neat
and
sheep
if
ye
have
sore
need
of
any
and
will
have
them
i
may
not
say
you
nay
but
i
pray
you
if
ye
may
do
without
them
not
to
take
my
or
their
engenderers
for
as
ye
have
heard
me
say
the
have
been
here
but
of
late
and
they
have
had
of
me
all
i
might
spare
but
now
let
me
tell
you
if
ye
long
after
that
there
is
venison
of
hart
and
hind
yea
and
of
buck
and
doe
to
be
had
on
this
plain
and
about
the
little
woods
at
the
feet
of
the
yonder
neither
are
they
exceeding
wild
for
since
i
may
not
take
them
i
scare
them
not
and
no
other
man
do
they
see
to
hurt
them
for
the
folk
come
straight
to
my
house
and
fare
straight
home
thence
but
i
will
lead
you
the
nighest
way
to
where
the
venison
is
easiest
to
be
gotten
as
to
the
wares
in
your
ship
if
ye
will
give
me
aught
i
will
take
it
with
a
good
will
and
chiefly
if
ye
have
a
fair
knife
or
two
and
a
roll
of
linen
cloth
that
were
a
good
refreshment
to
me
but
in
any
case
what
i
have
to
give
is
free
to
you
and
welcome
the
shipmaster
laughed
friend
said
he
we
can
thee
mickle
thanks
for
all
that
thou
biddest
us
and
wot
well
that
we
be
no
lifters
or
to
take
thy
livelihood
from
thee
so
if
thou
wilt
we
will
go
with
thee
and
upraise
the
hunt
and
meanwhile
we
will
come
aland
and
walk
on
the
green
grass
and
water
our
ship
with
thy
good
fresh
water
so
the
old
carle
went
back
to
his
house
to
make
them
ready
what
cheer
he
might
and
the
shipmen
who
were
twenty
and
one
all
told
what
with
the
mariners
and
arnold
and
walter
servants
went
ashore
all
but
two
who
watched
the
ship
and
abode
their
turn
they
went
for
both
the
master
and
walter
deemed
wariness
wisdom
lest
all
might
not
be
so
good
as
it
seemed
they
took
of
their
ashore
and
tilted
them
in
on
the
meadow
betwixt
the
house
and
the
ship
and
the
carle
brought
them
what
he
had
for
their
avail
of
fresh
fruits
and
cheeses
and
milk
and
wine
and
cyder
and
honey
and
there
they
feasted
nowise
ill
and
were
right
fain
chapter
vi
the
old
man
tells
walter
of
himself
walter
sees
a
shard
in
the
but
when
they
had
done
their
meat
and
drink
the
master
and
the
shipmen
went
about
the
watering
of
the
ship
and
the
others
strayed
off
along
the
meadow
so
that
presently
walter
was
left
alone
with
the
carle
and
fell
to
speech
with
him
and
said
father
meseemeth
thou
shouldest
have
some
strange
tale
to
tell
and
as
yet
we
have
asked
thee
of
nought
save
meat
for
our
bellies
now
if
i
ask
thee
concerning
thy
life
and
how
thou
camest
hither
and
abided
here
wilt
thou
tell
me
aught
the
old
man
smiled
on
him
and
said
son
my
tale
were
long
to
tell
and
mayhappen
concerning
much
thereof
my
memory
should
fail
me
and
withal
there
is
grief
therein
which
i
were
loth
to
awaken
nevertheless
if
thou
ask
i
will
answer
as
i
may
and
in
any
case
will
tell
thee
nought
save
the
truth
said
walter
well
then
hast
thou
been
long
here
yea
said
the
carle
since
i
was
a
young
man
and
a
stalwarth
knight
said
walter
this
house
didst
thou
build
it
and
raise
these
garths
and
plant
orchard
and
vineyard
and
gather
together
the
neat
and
the
sheep
or
did
some
other
do
all
this
for
thee
said
the
carle
i
did
none
of
all
this
there
was
one
here
before
me
and
i
entered
into
his
inheritance
as
though
this
were
a
lordly
manor
with
a
fair
castle
thereon
and
all
well
stocked
and
plenished
said
walter
didst
thou
find
thy
foregoer
alive
here
yea
said
the
elder
yet
he
lived
but
for
a
little
while
after
i
came
to
him
he
was
silent
a
while
and
then
he
said
i
slew
him
even
so
would
he
have
it
though
i
bade
him
a
better
lot
said
walter
didst
thou
come
hither
of
thine
own
will
mayhappen
said
the
carle
who
knoweth
now
have
i
no
will
to
do
either
this
or
that
it
is
wont
that
maketh
me
do
or
refrain
said
walter
tell
me
this
why
didst
thou
slay
the
man
did
he
any
scathe
to
thee
said
the
elder
when
i
slew
him
i
deemed
that
he
was
doing
me
all
scathe
but
now
i
know
that
it
was
not
so
thus
it
was
i
would
needs
go
where
he
had
been
before
and
he
stood
in
the
path
against
me
and
i
overthrew
him
and
went
on
the
way
i
would
what
came
thereof
said
walter
evil
came
of
it
said
the
carle
then
was
walter
silent
a
while
and
the
old
man
spake
nothing
but
there
came
a
smile
in
his
face
that
was
both
sly
and
somewhat
sad
walter
looked
on
him
and
said
was
it
from
hence
that
thou
wouldst
go
that
road
yea
said
the
carle
said
walter
and
now
wilt
thou
tell
me
what
that
road
was
whither
it
went
and
whereto
it
led
that
thou
must
needs
wend
it
though
thy
first
stride
were
over
a
dead
man
i
will
not
tell
thee
said
the
carle
then
they
held
their
peace
both
of
them
and
thereafter
got
on
to
other
talk
of
no
import
so
wore
the
day
till
night
came
and
they
slept
safely
and
on
the
morrow
after
they
had
broken
their
fast
the
more
part
of
them
set
off
with
the
carle
to
the
hunting
and
they
went
all
of
them
a
three
hours
faring
towards
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
which
was
all
grown
over
with
coppice
hazel
and
thorn
with
here
and
there
a
big
oak
or
there
it
was
said
the
old
man
where
the
venison
was
most
and
best
of
their
hunting
need
nought
be
said
saving
that
when
the
carle
had
put
them
on
the
track
of
the
deer
and
shown
them
what
to
do
he
came
back
again
with
walter
who
had
no
great
lust
for
the
hunting
and
sorely
longed
to
have
some
more
talk
with
the
said
carle
he
for
his
part
seemed
nought
loth
thereto
and
so
led
walter
to
a
mound
or
hillock
amidst
the
clear
of
the
plain
whence
all
was
to
be
seen
save
where
the
wood
covered
it
but
just
before
where
they
now
lay
down
there
was
no
wood
save
low
bushes
betwixt
them
and
the
and
walter
noted
that
whereas
otherwhere
save
in
one
place
whereto
their
eyes
were
turned
the
cliffs
seemed
wellnigh
or
quite
sheer
or
indeed
in
some
places
beetling
over
in
that
said
place
they
fell
away
from
each
other
on
either
side
and
before
this
sinking
was
a
slope
or
scree
that
went
gently
up
toward
the
sinking
of
the
wall
walter
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
this
place
and
spake
nought
till
the
carle
said
what
thou
hast
found
something
before
thee
to
look
on
what
is
it
then
quoth
walter
some
would
say
that
where
yonder
slopes
run
together
up
towards
that
sinking
in
the
there
will
be
a
pass
into
the
country
beyond
the
carle
smiled
and
said
yea
son
nor
so
saying
would
they
err
for
that
is
the
pass
into
the
whereby
those
huge
men
come
down
to
chaffer
with
me
yea
said
walter
and
therewith
he
turned
him
a
little
and
scanned
the
and
saw
how
a
few
miles
from
that
pass
it
turned
somewhat
sharply
toward
the
sea
narrowing
the
plain
much
there
till
it
made
a
bight
the
face
whereof
looked
wellnigh
north
instead
of
west
as
did
the
more
part
of
the
wall
and
in
the
midst
of
that
bight
was
a
dark
place
which
seemed
to
walter
like
a
downright
shard
in
the
cliff
for
the
face
of
the
wall
was
of
a
bleak
grey
and
it
was
but
little
furrowed
so
then
walter
spake
lo
old
friend
there
yonder
is
again
a
place
that
meseemeth
is
a
pass
whereunto
doth
that
one
lead
and
he
pointed
to
it
but
the
old
man
did
not
follow
the
pointing
of
his
finger
but
looking
down
on
the
ground
answered
confusedly
and
said
maybe
i
wot
not
i
deem
that
it
also
leadeth
into
the
by
a
roundabout
road
it
leadeth
into
the
far
land
walter
answered
nought
for
a
strange
thought
had
come
uppermost
in
his
mind
that
the
carle
knew
far
more
than
he
would
say
of
that
pass
and
that
he
himself
might
be
led
thereby
to
find
the
wondrous
three
he
caught
his
breath
hardly
and
his
heart
knocked
against
his
ribs
but
he
refrained
from
speaking
for
a
long
while
but
at
last
he
spake
in
a
sharp
hard
voice
which
he
scarce
knew
for
his
own
father
tell
me
i
adjure
thee
by
god
and
was
it
through
yonder
shard
that
the
road
lay
when
thou
must
needs
make
thy
first
stride
over
a
dead
man
the
old
man
spake
not
a
while
then
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
walter
full
in
the
eyes
and
said
in
a
steady
voice
no
it
was
not
thereafter
they
sat
looking
at
each
other
a
while
but
at
last
walter
turned
his
eyes
away
but
knew
not
what
they
beheld
nor
where
he
was
but
he
was
as
one
in
a
swoon
for
he
knew
full
well
that
the
carle
had
lied
to
him
and
that
he
might
as
well
have
said
aye
as
no
and
told
him
that
it
verily
was
by
that
same
shard
that
he
had
stridden
over
a
dead
man
nevertheless
he
made
as
little
semblance
thereof
as
he
might
and
presently
came
to
himself
and
fell
to
talking
of
other
matters
that
had
nought
to
do
with
the
adventures
of
the
land
but
after
a
while
he
spake
suddenly
and
said
my
master
i
was
thinking
of
a
thing
yea
of
what
said
the
carle
of
this
said
walter
that
here
in
this
land
be
strange
adventures
toward
and
that
if
we
and
i
in
especial
were
to
turn
our
backs
on
them
and
go
home
with
nothing
done
it
were
pity
of
our
lives
for
all
will
be
dull
and
deedless
there
i
was
deeming
it
were
good
if
we
tried
the
adventure
what
adventure
said
the
old
man
rising
up
on
his
elbow
and
staring
sternly
on
him
said
walter
the
wending
yonder
pass
to
the
eastward
whereby
the
huge
men
come
to
thee
from
out
of
the
that
we
might
see
what
should
come
thereof
the
carle
leaned
back
again
and
smiled
and
shook
his
head
and
spake
that
adventure
were
speedily
proven
death
would
come
of
it
my
son
yea
and
how
said
walter
the
carle
said
the
big
men
would
take
thee
and
offer
thee
up
as
a
to
that
woman
who
is
their
mawmet
and
if
ye
go
all
then
shall
they
do
the
like
with
all
of
you
said
walter
is
that
sure
dead
sure
said
the
carle
how
knowest
thou
this
said
walter
i
have
been
there
myself
said
the
carle
yea
said
walter
but
thou
camest
away
whole
art
thou
sure
thereof
said
the
carle
thou
art
alive
yet
old
man
said
walter
for
i
have
seen
thee
eat
thy
meat
which
ghosts
use
not
to
do
and
he
laughed
but
the
old
man
answered
soberly
if
i
escaped
it
was
by
this
that
another
woman
saved
me
and
not
often
shall
that
befall
nor
wholly
was
i
saved
my
body
escaped
forsooth
but
where
is
my
soul
where
is
my
heart
and
my
life
young
man
i
rede
thee
try
no
such
adventure
but
go
home
to
thy
kindred
if
thou
canst
moreover
wouldst
thou
fare
alone
the
others
shall
hinder
thee
said
walter
i
am
the
master
they
shall
do
as
i
bid
them
besides
they
will
be
well
pleased
to
share
my
goods
amongst
them
if
i
give
them
a
writing
to
clear
them
of
all
charges
which
might
be
brought
against
them
my
son
my
son
said
the
carle
i
pray
thee
go
not
to
thy
death
walter
heard
him
silently
but
as
if
he
were
persuaded
to
refrain
and
then
the
old
man
fell
to
and
told
him
much
concerning
this
and
their
customs
speaking
very
freely
of
them
but
walter
ears
were
scarce
open
to
this
talk
whereas
he
deemed
that
he
should
have
nought
to
do
with
those
wild
men
and
he
durst
not
ask
again
concerning
the
country
whereto
led
the
pass
on
the
northward
chapter
vii
walter
comes
to
the
shard
in
the
as
they
were
in
converse
thus
they
heard
the
hunters
blowing
on
their
horns
all
together
whereon
the
old
man
arose
and
said
i
deem
by
the
blowing
that
the
hunt
will
be
over
and
done
and
that
they
be
blowing
on
their
fellows
who
have
gone
about
the
wood
it
is
now
some
five
hours
after
noon
and
thy
men
will
be
getting
back
with
their
venison
and
will
be
fainest
of
the
victuals
they
have
caught
therefore
will
i
hasten
on
before
and
get
ready
fire
and
water
and
other
matters
for
the
cooking
wilt
thou
come
with
me
young
master
or
abide
thy
men
here
walter
said
lightly
i
will
rest
and
abide
them
here
since
i
can
not
fail
to
see
them
hence
as
they
go
on
their
ways
to
thine
house
and
it
may
be
well
that
i
be
at
hand
to
command
them
and
forbid
and
put
some
order
amongst
them
for
rough
playmates
they
be
some
of
them
and
now
all
heated
with
the
hunting
and
the
joy
of
the
green
earth
thus
he
spoke
as
if
nought
were
toward
save
supper
and
bed
but
inwardly
hope
and
fear
were
contending
in
him
and
again
his
heart
beat
so
hard
that
he
deemed
that
the
carle
must
surely
hear
it
but
the
old
man
took
him
but
according
to
his
outward
seeming
and
nodded
his
head
and
went
away
quietly
toward
his
house
when
he
had
been
gone
a
little
walter
rose
up
heedfully
he
had
with
him
a
scrip
wherein
was
some
cheese
and
and
a
little
flasket
of
wine
a
short
bow
he
had
with
him
and
a
quiver
of
arrows
and
he
was
girt
with
a
strong
and
good
sword
and
a
withal
he
looked
to
all
this
gear
that
it
was
nought
amiss
and
then
speedily
went
down
off
the
mound
and
when
he
was
come
down
he
found
that
it
covered
him
from
men
coming
out
of
the
wood
if
he
went
straight
thence
to
that
shard
of
the
where
was
the
pass
that
led
southward
now
it
is
no
nay
that
thitherward
he
turned
and
went
wisely
lest
the
carle
should
make
a
backward
cast
and
see
him
or
lest
any
straggler
of
his
own
folk
might
happen
upon
him
for
to
say
sooth
he
deemed
that
did
they
wind
him
they
would
be
like
to
let
him
of
his
journey
he
had
noted
the
bearings
of
the
cliffs
nigh
the
shard
and
whereas
he
could
see
their
heads
everywhere
except
from
the
depths
of
the
thicket
he
was
not
like
to
go
astray
he
had
made
no
great
way
ere
he
heard
the
horns
blowing
all
together
again
in
one
place
and
looking
thitherward
through
the
leafy
boughs
for
he
was
now
amidst
of
a
thicket
he
saw
his
men
thronging
the
mound
and
had
no
doubt
therefore
that
they
were
blowing
on
him
but
being
well
under
cover
he
heeded
it
nought
and
lying
still
a
little
saw
them
go
down
off
the
mound
and
go
all
of
them
toward
the
carle
house
still
blowing
as
they
went
but
not
faring
wherefore
it
was
clear
that
they
were
nought
troubled
about
him
so
he
went
on
his
way
to
the
shard
and
there
is
nothing
to
say
of
his
journey
till
he
got
before
it
with
the
last
of
the
clear
day
and
entered
it
straightway
it
was
in
sooth
a
downright
breach
or
cleft
in
the
wall
and
there
was
no
hill
or
bent
leading
up
to
it
nothing
but
a
tumble
of
stones
before
it
which
was
somewhat
uneasy
going
yet
needed
nought
but
labour
to
overcome
it
and
when
he
had
got
over
this
and
was
in
the
very
pass
itself
he
found
it
no
ill
going
forsooth
at
first
it
was
little
worse
than
a
rough
road
betwixt
two
great
stony
slopes
though
a
little
trickle
of
water
ran
down
amidst
of
it
so
though
it
was
so
nigh
nightfall
yet
walter
pressed
on
yea
and
long
after
the
very
night
was
come
for
the
moon
rose
wide
and
bright
a
little
after
nightfall
but
at
last
he
had
gone
so
long
and
was
so
wearied
that
he
deemed
it
nought
but
wisdom
to
rest
him
and
so
lay
down
on
a
piece
of
greensward
betwixt
the
stones
when
he
had
eaten
a
morsel
out
of
his
satchel
and
drunk
of
the
water
out
of
the
stream
there
as
he
lay
if
he
had
any
doubt
of
peril
his
weariness
soon
made
it
all
one
to
him
for
presently
he
was
sleeping
as
soundly
as
any
man
in
langton
on
holm
chapter
viii
walter
wends
the
waste
day
was
yet
young
when
he
awoke
he
leapt
to
his
feet
and
went
down
to
the
stream
and
drank
of
its
waters
and
washed
the
night
off
him
in
a
pool
thereof
and
then
set
forth
on
his
way
again
when
he
had
gone
some
three
hours
the
road
which
had
been
going
up
all
the
way
but
somewhat
gently
grew
steeper
and
the
bent
on
either
side
lowered
and
lowered
till
it
sank
at
last
altogether
and
then
was
he
on
a
rough
with
little
grass
and
no
water
save
that
now
and
again
was
a
soft
place
with
a
flow
amidst
of
it
and
such
places
he
must
needs
fetch
a
compass
about
lest
he
be
mired
he
gave
himself
but
little
rest
eating
what
he
needs
must
as
he
went
the
day
was
bright
and
calm
so
that
the
sun
was
never
hidden
and
he
steered
by
it
due
south
all
that
day
he
went
and
found
no
more
change
in
that
huge
neck
save
that
whiles
it
was
more
and
whiles
less
steep
a
little
before
nightfall
he
happened
on
a
shallow
pool
some
twenty
yards
over
and
he
deemed
it
good
to
rest
there
since
there
was
water
for
his
avail
though
he
might
have
made
somewhat
more
out
of
the
tail
end
of
the
day
when
dawn
came
again
he
awoke
and
arose
nor
spent
much
time
over
his
breakfast
but
pressed
on
all
he
might
and
now
he
said
to
himself
that
whatsoever
other
peril
were
athwart
his
way
he
was
out
of
the
danger
of
the
chase
of
his
own
folk
all
this
while
he
had
seen
no
beast
save
now
and
again
a
and
once
some
outlandish
kind
of
hare
and
of
fowl
but
very
few
a
crow
or
two
a
hawk
and
twice
an
eagle
high
up
aloft
again
the
third
night
he
slept
in
the
stony
wilderness
which
still
led
him
up
and
up
only
toward
the
end
of
the
day
himseemed
that
it
had
been
less
steep
for
a
long
while
otherwise
nought
was
changed
on
all
sides
it
was
nought
but
the
endless
neck
wherefrom
nought
could
be
seen
but
some
other
part
of
itself
this
fourth
night
withal
he
found
no
water
whereby
he
might
rest
so
that
he
awoke
parched
and
longing
to
drink
just
when
the
dawn
was
at
its
coldest
but
on
the
fifth
morrow
the
ground
rose
but
little
and
at
last
when
he
had
been
going
wearily
a
long
while
and
now
hard
on
noontide
his
thirst
grieved
him
sorely
he
came
on
a
spring
welling
out
from
under
a
high
rock
the
water
wherefrom
trickled
feebly
away
so
eager
was
he
to
drink
that
at
first
he
heeded
nought
else
but
when
his
thirst
was
fully
quenched
his
eyes
caught
sight
of
the
stream
which
flowed
from
the
well
and
he
gave
a
shout
for
lo
it
was
running
south
wherefore
it
was
with
a
merry
heart
that
he
went
on
and
as
he
went
came
on
more
streams
all
running
south
or
thereabouts
he
hastened
on
all
he
might
but
in
despite
of
all
the
speed
he
made
and
that
he
felt
the
land
now
going
down
southward
night
overtook
him
in
that
same
wilderness
yet
when
he
stayed
at
last
for
sheer
weariness
he
lay
down
in
what
he
deemed
by
the
moonlight
to
be
a
shallow
valley
with
a
ridge
at
the
southern
end
thereof
he
slept
long
and
when
he
awoke
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
never
was
brighter
or
clearer
morning
on
the
earth
than
was
that
he
arose
and
ate
of
what
little
was
yet
left
him
and
drank
of
the
water
of
a
stream
which
he
had
followed
the
evening
before
and
beside
which
he
had
laid
him
down
and
then
set
forth
again
with
no
great
hope
to
come
on
new
tidings
that
day
but
yet
when
he
was
fairly
afoot
himseemed
that
there
was
something
new
in
the
air
which
he
breathed
that
was
soft
and
bore
sweet
scents
home
to
him
whereas
heretofore
and
that
especially
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
it
had
been
harsh
and
void
like
the
face
of
the
desert
itself
so
on
he
went
and
presently
was
mounting
the
ridge
aforesaid
and
as
oft
happens
when
one
climbs
a
steep
place
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
till
he
felt
he
was
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
then
he
stopped
to
take
breath
and
raised
his
head
and
looked
and
lo
he
was
verily
on
the
brow
of
the
great
and
down
below
him
was
the
hanging
of
the
great
which
fell
down
not
slowly
as
those
he
had
been
those
days
but
speedily
enough
though
with
little
of
broken
places
or
sheer
cliffs
but
beyond
this
last
of
the
desert
there
was
before
him
a
lovely
land
of
wooded
hills
green
plains
and
little
valleys
stretching
out
far
and
wide
till
it
ended
at
last
in
great
blue
mountains
and
white
snowy
peaks
beyond
them
then
for
very
surprise
of
joy
his
spirit
wavered
and
he
felt
faint
and
dizzy
so
that
he
was
fain
to
sit
down
a
while
and
cover
his
face
with
his
hands
presently
he
came
to
his
sober
mind
again
and
stood
up
and
looked
forth
keenly
and
saw
no
sign
of
any
dwelling
of
man
but
he
said
to
himself
that
that
might
well
be
because
the
good
and
land
was
still
so
far
off
and
that
he
might
yet
look
to
find
men
and
their
dwellings
when
he
had
left
the
mountain
wilderness
quite
behind
him
so
therewith
he
fell
to
going
his
ways
down
the
mountain
and
lost
little
time
therein
whereas
he
now
had
his
livelihood
to
look
to
chapter
ix
walter
happeneth
on
the
first
of
those
three
creatures
what
with
one
thing
what
with
another
as
his
having
to
turn
out
of
his
way
for
sheer
rocks
or
for
slopes
so
steep
that
he
might
not
try
the
peril
of
them
and
again
for
bogs
impassable
he
was
fully
three
days
more
before
he
had
quite
come
out
of
the
stony
waste
and
by
that
time
though
he
had
never
lacked
water
his
scanty
victual
was
quite
done
for
all
his
careful
husbandry
thereof
but
this
troubled
him
little
whereas
he
looked
to
find
wild
fruits
here
and
there
and
to
shoot
some
small
deer
as
hare
or
coney
and
make
a
shift
to
cook
the
same
since
he
had
with
him
flint
and
moreover
the
further
he
went
the
surer
he
was
that
he
should
soon
come
across
a
dwelling
so
smooth
and
fair
as
everything
looked
before
him
and
he
had
scant
fear
save
that
he
might
happen
on
men
who
should
enthrall
him
but
when
he
was
come
down
past
the
first
green
slopes
he
was
so
worn
that
he
said
to
himself
that
rest
was
better
than
meat
so
little
as
he
had
slept
for
the
last
three
days
so
he
laid
him
down
under
an
by
a
nor
asked
what
was
but
had
his
fill
of
sleep
and
even
when
he
awoke
in
the
fresh
morning
was
little
fain
of
rising
but
lay
betwixt
sleeping
and
waking
for
some
three
hours
more
then
he
arose
and
went
further
down
the
next
green
bent
yet
somewhat
slowly
because
of
his
and
the
scent
of
that
fair
land
came
up
to
him
like
the
odour
of
one
great
nosegay
so
he
came
to
where
the
land
was
level
and
there
were
many
trees
as
oak
and
ash
and
and
and
hornbeam
and
not
growing
in
a
close
wood
or
tangled
thicket
but
set
as
though
in
order
on
the
flowery
greensward
even
as
it
might
be
in
a
great
park
so
came
he
to
a
big
whereof
many
boughs
hung
low
down
laden
with
fruit
his
belly
rejoiced
at
the
sight
and
he
caught
hold
of
a
bough
and
fell
to
plucking
and
eating
but
whiles
he
was
amidst
of
this
he
heard
suddenly
close
anigh
him
a
strange
noise
of
roaring
and
braying
not
very
great
but
exceeding
fierce
and
terrible
and
not
like
to
the
voice
of
any
beast
that
he
knew
as
has
been
aforesaid
walter
was
no
but
what
with
the
weakness
of
his
travail
and
hunger
what
with
the
strangeness
of
his
adventure
and
his
loneliness
his
spirit
failed
him
he
turned
round
towards
the
noise
his
knees
shook
and
he
trembled
this
way
and
that
he
looked
and
then
gave
a
great
cry
and
tumbled
down
in
a
swoon
for
close
before
him
at
his
very
feet
was
the
dwarf
whose
image
he
had
seen
before
clad
in
his
yellow
coat
and
grinning
up
at
him
from
his
hideous
hairy
countenance
how
long
he
lay
there
as
one
dead
he
knew
not
but
when
he
woke
again
there
was
the
dwarf
sitting
on
his
hams
close
by
him
and
when
he
lifted
up
his
head
the
dwarf
sent
out
that
fearful
harsh
voice
again
but
this
time
walter
could
make
out
words
therein
and
knew
that
the
creature
spoke
and
said
how
now
what
art
thou
whence
comest
what
wantest
walter
sat
up
and
said
i
am
a
man
i
hight
golden
walter
i
come
from
langton
i
want
victual
said
the
dwarf
writhing
his
face
grievously
and
laughing
forsooth
i
know
it
all
i
asked
thee
to
see
what
wise
thou
wouldst
lie
i
was
sent
forth
to
look
for
thee
and
i
have
brought
thee
loathsome
bread
with
me
such
as
ye
aliens
must
needs
eat
take
it
therewith
he
drew
a
loaf
from
a
satchel
which
he
bore
and
thrust
it
towards
walter
who
took
it
somewhat
doubtfully
for
all
his
hunger
the
dwarf
yelled
at
him
art
thou
dainty
alien
wouldst
thou
have
flesh
well
give
me
thy
bow
and
an
arrow
or
two
since
thou
art
sick
and
i
will
get
thee
a
coney
or
a
hare
or
a
quail
maybe
ah
i
forgot
thou
art
dainty
and
wilt
not
eat
flesh
as
i
do
blood
and
all
together
but
must
needs
half
burn
it
in
the
fire
or
mar
it
with
hot
water
as
they
say
my
lady
does
or
as
the
wretch
the
thing
does
i
know
that
for
i
have
seen
it
eating
nay
said
walter
this
sufficeth
and
he
fell
to
eating
the
bread
which
was
sweet
between
his
teeth
then
when
he
had
eaten
a
while
for
hunger
compelled
him
he
said
to
the
dwarf
but
what
meanest
thou
by
the
wretch
and
the
thing
and
what
lady
is
thy
lady
the
creature
let
out
another
wordless
roar
as
of
furious
anger
and
then
the
words
came
it
hath
a
face
white
and
red
like
to
thine
and
hands
white
as
thine
yea
but
whiter
and
the
like
it
is
underneath
its
raiment
only
whiter
still
for
i
have
seen
it
yes
i
have
seen
it
ah
yes
and
yes
and
yes
and
therewith
his
words
ran
into
gibber
and
yelling
and
he
rolled
about
and
smote
at
the
grass
but
in
a
while
he
grew
quiet
again
and
sat
still
and
then
fell
to
laughing
horribly
again
and
then
said
but
thou
fool
wilt
think
it
fair
if
thou
fallest
into
its
hands
and
wilt
repent
it
thereafter
as
i
did
oh
the
mocking
and
gibes
of
it
and
the
tears
and
shrieks
of
it
and
the
knife
what
sayest
thou
of
my
lady
what
lady
o
alien
what
other
lady
is
there
and
what
shall
i
tell
thee
of
her
it
is
like
that
she
made
me
as
she
made
the
bear
men
but
she
made
not
the
wretch
the
thing
and
she
hateth
it
sorely
as
i
do
and
some
day
to
come
thereat
he
brake
off
and
fell
to
wordless
yelling
a
long
while
and
thereafter
spake
all
panting
now
i
have
told
thee
overmuch
and
o
if
my
lady
come
to
hear
thereof
now
i
will
go
and
therewith
he
took
out
two
more
loaves
from
his
wallet
and
tossed
them
to
walter
and
so
turned
and
went
his
ways
whiles
walking
upright
as
walter
had
seen
his
image
on
the
quay
of
langton
whiles
bounding
and
rolling
like
a
ball
thrown
by
a
lad
whiles
scuttling
along
on
like
an
evil
beast
and
ever
and
anon
giving
forth
that
harsh
and
evil
cry
walter
sat
a
while
after
he
was
out
of
sight
so
stricken
with
horror
and
loathing
and
a
fear
of
he
knew
not
what
that
he
might
not
move
then
he
plucked
up
a
heart
and
looked
to
his
weapons
and
put
the
other
loaves
into
his
scrip
then
he
arose
and
went
his
ways
wondering
yea
and
dreading
what
kind
of
creature
he
should
next
fall
in
with
for
soothly
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
be
worse
than
death
if
they
were
all
such
as
this
one
and
that
if
it
were
so
he
must
needs
slay
and
be
slain
chapter
x
walter
happeneth
on
another
creature
in
the
strange
land
but
as
he
went
on
through
the
fair
and
sweet
land
so
bright
and
and
he
now
rested
and
fed
the
horror
and
fear
ran
off
from
him
and
he
wandered
on
merrily
neither
did
aught
befall
him
save
the
coming
of
night
when
he
laid
him
down
under
a
great
spreading
oak
with
his
drawn
sword
ready
to
hand
and
fell
asleep
at
once
and
woke
not
till
the
sun
was
high
then
he
arose
and
went
on
his
way
again
and
the
land
was
no
worser
than
yesterday
but
even
better
it
might
be
the
greensward
more
flowery
the
oaks
and
chestnuts
greater
deer
of
diverse
kinds
he
saw
and
might
easily
have
got
his
meat
thereof
but
he
meddled
not
with
them
since
he
had
his
bread
and
was
timorous
of
lighting
a
fire
withal
he
doubted
little
of
having
some
entertainment
and
that
might
be
nought
evil
since
even
that
fearful
dwarf
had
been
courteous
to
him
after
his
kind
and
had
done
him
good
and
not
harm
but
of
the
happening
on
the
wretch
and
the
thing
whereof
the
dwarf
spake
he
was
yet
somewhat
afeard
after
he
had
gone
a
while
and
whenas
the
summer
morn
was
at
its
brightest
he
saw
a
little
way
ahead
a
grey
rock
rising
up
from
amidst
of
a
ring
of
so
he
turned
thither
straightway
for
in
this
land
he
had
seen
no
rocks
heretofore
and
as
he
went
he
saw
that
there
was
a
fountain
gushing
out
from
under
the
rock
which
ran
thence
in
a
fair
little
stream
and
when
he
had
the
rock
and
the
fountain
and
the
stream
clear
before
him
lo
a
child
of
adam
sitting
beside
the
fountain
under
the
shadow
of
the
rock
he
drew
a
little
nigher
and
then
he
saw
that
it
was
a
woman
clad
in
green
like
the
sward
whereon
she
lay
she
was
playing
with
the
welling
out
of
the
water
and
she
had
trussed
up
her
sleeves
to
the
shoulder
that
she
might
thrust
her
bare
arms
therein
her
shoes
of
black
leather
lay
on
the
grass
beside
her
and
her
feet
and
legs
yet
shone
with
the
brook
belike
amidst
the
splashing
and
clatter
of
the
water
she
did
not
hear
him
drawing
nigh
so
that
he
was
close
to
her
before
she
lifted
up
her
face
and
saw
him
and
he
beheld
her
that
it
was
the
maiden
of
the
pageant
she
reddened
when
she
saw
him
and
hastily
covered
up
her
legs
with
her
and
drew
down
the
sleeves
over
her
arms
but
otherwise
stirred
not
as
for
him
he
stood
still
striving
to
speak
to
her
but
no
word
might
he
bring
out
and
his
heart
beat
sorely
but
the
maiden
spake
to
him
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
wherein
was
now
no
trouble
thou
art
an
alien
art
thou
not
for
i
have
not
seen
thee
before
yea
he
said
i
am
an
alien
wilt
thou
be
good
to
me
she
said
and
why
not
i
was
afraid
at
first
for
i
thought
it
had
been
the
king
son
i
looked
to
see
none
other
for
of
goodly
men
he
has
been
the
only
one
here
in
the
land
this
long
while
till
thy
coming
he
said
didst
thou
look
for
my
coming
at
about
this
time
o
nay
she
said
how
might
i
said
walter
i
wot
not
but
the
other
man
seemed
to
be
looking
for
me
and
knew
of
me
and
he
brought
me
bread
to
eat
she
looked
on
him
anxiously
and
grew
somewhat
pale
as
she
said
what
other
one
now
walter
did
not
know
what
the
dwarf
might
be
to
her
or
what
not
so
he
would
not
show
his
loathing
of
him
but
answered
wisely
the
little
man
in
the
yellow
raiment
but
when
she
heard
that
word
she
went
suddenly
very
pale
and
leaned
her
head
aback
and
beat
the
air
with
her
hands
but
said
presently
in
a
faint
voice
i
pray
thee
talk
not
of
that
one
while
i
am
by
nor
even
think
of
him
if
thou
mayest
forbear
he
spake
not
and
she
was
a
little
while
before
she
came
to
herself
again
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
upon
walter
and
smiled
kindly
on
him
as
though
to
ask
his
pardon
for
having
scared
him
then
she
rose
up
in
her
place
and
stood
before
him
and
they
were
nigh
together
for
the
stream
betwixt
them
was
little
but
he
still
looked
anxiously
upon
her
and
said
have
i
hurt
thee
i
pray
thy
pardon
she
looked
on
him
more
sweetly
still
and
said
o
nay
thou
wouldst
not
hurt
me
thou
then
she
blushed
very
red
and
he
in
like
wise
but
afterwards
she
turned
pale
and
laid
a
hand
on
her
breast
and
walter
cried
out
hastily
o
me
i
have
hurt
thee
again
wherein
have
i
done
amiss
in
nought
in
nought
she
said
but
i
am
troubled
i
wot
not
wherefore
some
thought
hath
taken
hold
of
me
and
i
know
it
not
mayhappen
in
a
little
while
i
shall
know
what
troubles
me
now
i
bid
thee
depart
from
me
a
little
and
i
will
abide
here
and
when
thou
comest
back
it
will
either
be
that
i
have
found
it
out
or
not
and
in
either
case
i
will
tell
thee
she
spoke
earnestly
to
him
but
he
said
how
long
shall
i
abide
away
her
face
was
troubled
as
she
answered
him
for
no
long
while
he
smiled
on
her
and
turned
away
and
went
a
space
to
the
other
side
of
the
whence
she
was
still
within
eyeshot
there
he
abode
until
the
time
seemed
long
to
him
but
he
schooled
himself
and
forbore
for
he
said
lest
she
send
me
away
again
so
he
abided
until
again
the
time
seemed
long
to
him
and
she
called
not
to
him
but
once
again
he
forbore
to
go
then
at
last
he
arose
and
his
heart
beat
and
he
trembled
and
he
walked
back
again
speedily
and
came
to
the
maiden
who
was
still
standing
by
the
rock
of
the
spring
her
arms
hanging
down
her
eyes
downcast
she
looked
up
at
him
as
he
drew
nigh
and
her
face
changed
with
eagerness
as
she
said
i
am
glad
thou
art
come
back
though
it
be
no
long
while
since
thy
departure
sooth
to
say
it
was
scarce
half
an
hour
in
all
nevertheless
i
have
been
thinking
many
things
and
thereof
will
i
now
tell
thee
he
said
maiden
there
is
a
river
betwixt
us
though
it
be
no
big
one
shall
i
not
stride
over
and
come
to
thee
that
we
may
sit
down
together
side
by
side
on
the
green
grass
nay
she
said
not
yet
tarry
a
while
till
i
have
told
thee
of
matters
i
must
now
tell
thee
of
my
thoughts
in
order
her
colour
went
and
came
now
and
she
plaited
the
folds
of
her
gown
with
restless
fingers
at
last
she
said
now
the
first
thing
is
this
that
though
thou
hast
seen
me
first
only
within
this
hour
thou
hast
set
thine
heart
upon
me
to
have
me
for
thy
and
thy
darling
and
if
this
be
not
so
then
is
all
my
speech
yea
and
all
my
hope
come
to
an
end
at
once
o
yea
said
walter
even
so
it
is
but
how
thou
hast
found
this
out
i
wot
not
since
now
for
the
first
time
i
say
it
that
thou
art
indeed
my
love
and
my
dear
and
my
darling
hush
she
said
hush
lest
the
wood
have
ears
and
thy
speech
is
loud
abide
and
i
shall
tell
thee
how
i
know
it
whether
this
thy
love
shall
outlast
the
first
time
that
thou
holdest
my
body
in
thine
arms
i
wot
not
nor
dost
thou
but
sore
is
my
hope
that
it
may
be
so
for
i
also
though
it
be
but
scarce
an
hour
since
i
set
eyes
on
thee
have
cast
mine
eyes
on
thee
to
have
thee
for
my
love
and
my
darling
and
my
and
this
is
how
i
wot
that
thou
lovest
me
my
friend
now
is
all
this
dear
and
joyful
and
overflows
my
heart
with
sweetness
but
now
must
i
tell
thee
of
the
fear
and
the
evil
which
lieth
behind
it
then
walter
stretched
out
his
hands
to
her
and
cried
out
yea
yea
but
whatever
evil
entangle
us
now
we
both
know
these
two
things
to
wit
that
thou
lovest
me
and
i
thee
wilt
thou
not
come
hither
that
i
may
cast
mine
arms
about
thee
and
kiss
thee
if
not
thy
kind
lips
or
thy
friendly
face
at
all
yet
at
least
thy
dear
hand
yea
that
i
may
touch
thy
body
in
some
wise
she
looked
on
him
steadily
and
said
softly
nay
this
above
all
things
must
not
be
and
that
it
may
not
be
is
a
part
of
the
evil
which
entangles
us
but
hearken
friend
once
again
i
tell
thee
that
thy
voice
is
over
loud
in
this
wilderness
fruitful
of
evil
now
i
have
told
thee
indeed
of
two
things
whereof
we
both
wot
but
next
i
must
needs
tell
thee
of
things
whereof
i
wot
and
thou
wottest
not
yet
this
were
better
that
thou
pledge
thy
word
not
to
touch
so
much
as
one
of
my
hands
and
that
we
go
together
a
little
way
hence
away
from
these
tumbled
stones
and
sit
down
upon
the
open
greensward
whereas
here
is
cover
if
there
be
spying
abroad
again
as
she
spoke
she
turned
very
pale
but
walter
said
since
it
must
be
so
i
pledge
thee
my
word
to
thee
as
i
love
thee
and
therewith
she
knelt
down
and
did
on
her
and
then
sprang
lightly
over
the
rivulet
and
then
the
twain
of
them
went
side
by
side
some
half
a
furlong
thence
and
sat
down
shadowed
by
the
boughs
of
a
slim
growing
up
out
of
the
greensward
whereon
for
a
good
space
around
was
neither
bush
nor
brake
there
began
the
maiden
to
talk
soberly
and
said
this
is
what
i
must
needs
say
to
thee
now
that
thou
art
come
into
a
land
perilous
for
any
one
that
loveth
aught
of
good
from
which
forsooth
i
were
fain
that
thou
wert
gotten
away
safely
even
though
i
should
die
of
longing
for
thee
as
for
myself
my
peril
is
in
a
measure
less
than
thine
i
mean
the
peril
of
death
but
lo
thou
this
iron
on
my
foot
is
token
that
i
am
a
thrall
and
thou
knowest
in
what
wise
thralls
must
pay
for
transgressions
furthermore
of
what
i
am
and
how
i
came
hither
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
but
somewhile
maybe
i
shall
tell
thee
i
serve
an
evil
mistress
of
whom
i
may
say
that
scarce
i
wot
if
she
be
a
woman
or
not
but
by
some
creatures
is
she
accounted
for
a
god
and
as
a
god
is
heried
and
surely
never
god
was
crueller
nor
colder
than
she
me
she
hateth
sorely
yet
if
she
hated
me
little
or
nought
small
were
the
gain
to
me
if
it
were
her
pleasure
to
deal
hardly
by
me
but
as
things
now
are
and
are
like
to
be
it
would
not
be
for
her
pleasure
but
for
her
pain
and
loss
to
make
an
end
of
me
therefore
as
i
said
now
my
mere
life
is
not
in
peril
with
her
unless
perchance
some
sudden
passion
get
the
better
of
her
and
she
slay
me
and
repent
of
it
thereafter
for
so
it
is
that
if
it
be
the
least
evil
of
her
conditions
that
she
is
wanton
at
least
wanton
she
is
to
the
letter
many
a
time
hath
she
cast
the
net
for
the
catching
of
some
goodly
young
man
and
her
latest
prey
save
it
be
thou
is
the
young
man
whom
i
named
when
first
i
saw
thee
by
the
name
of
the
king
son
he
is
with
us
yet
and
i
fear
him
for
of
late
hath
he
wearied
of
her
though
it
is
but
plain
truth
to
say
of
her
that
she
is
the
wonder
of
all
beauties
of
the
world
he
hath
wearied
of
her
i
say
and
hath
cast
his
eyes
upon
me
and
if
i
were
heedless
he
would
betray
me
to
the
uttermost
of
the
wrath
of
my
mistress
for
needs
must
i
say
of
him
though
he
be
a
goodly
man
and
now
fallen
into
thralldom
that
he
hath
no
bowels
of
compassion
but
is
a
dastard
who
for
an
hour
pleasure
would
undo
me
and
thereafter
would
stand
by
smiling
and
taking
my
mistress
pardon
with
good
cheer
while
for
me
would
be
no
pardon
seest
thou
therefore
how
it
is
with
me
between
these
two
cruel
fools
and
moreover
there
are
others
of
whom
i
will
not
even
speak
to
thee
and
therewith
she
put
her
hands
before
her
face
and
wept
and
murmured
who
shall
deliver
me
from
this
death
in
life
but
walter
cried
out
for
what
else
am
i
come
hither
i
i
and
it
was
a
near
thing
that
he
did
not
take
her
in
his
arms
but
he
remembered
his
pledged
word
and
drew
aback
from
her
in
terror
whereas
he
had
an
inkling
of
why
she
would
not
suffer
it
and
he
wept
with
her
but
suddenly
the
maid
left
weeping
and
said
in
a
changed
voice
friend
whereas
thou
speakest
of
delivering
me
it
is
more
like
that
i
shall
deliver
thee
and
now
i
pray
thy
pardon
for
thus
grieving
thee
with
my
grief
and
that
more
especially
because
thou
mayst
not
solace
thy
grief
with
kisses
and
caresses
but
so
it
was
that
for
once
i
was
smitten
by
the
thought
of
the
anguish
of
this
land
and
the
joy
of
all
the
world
besides
therewith
she
caught
her
breath
in
a
but
refrained
her
and
went
on
now
dear
friend
and
darling
take
good
heed
to
all
that
i
shall
say
to
thee
whereas
thou
must
do
after
the
teaching
of
my
words
and
first
i
deem
by
the
monster
having
met
thee
at
the
gates
of
the
land
and
refreshed
thee
that
the
mistress
hath
looked
for
thy
coming
nay
by
thy
coming
hither
at
all
that
she
hath
cast
her
net
and
caught
thee
hast
thou
noted
aught
that
might
seem
to
make
this
more
like
said
walter
three
times
in
full
daylight
have
i
seen
go
past
me
the
images
of
the
monster
and
thee
and
a
glorious
lady
even
as
if
ye
were
alive
and
therewith
he
told
her
in
few
words
how
it
had
gone
with
him
since
that
day
on
the
quay
at
langton
she
said
then
it
is
no
longer
perhaps
but
certain
that
thou
art
her
latest
catch
and
even
so
i
deemed
from
the
first
and
dear
friend
this
is
why
i
have
not
suffered
thee
to
kiss
or
caress
me
so
sore
as
i
longed
for
thee
for
the
mistress
will
have
thee
for
her
only
and
hath
lured
thee
hither
for
nought
else
and
she
is
wise
in
wizardry
even
as
some
deal
am
i
and
wert
thou
to
touch
me
with
hand
or
mouth
on
my
naked
flesh
yea
or
were
it
even
my
raiment
then
would
she
scent
the
savour
of
thy
love
upon
me
and
then
though
it
may
be
she
would
spare
thee
she
would
not
spare
me
then
was
she
silent
a
little
and
seemed
very
downcast
and
walter
held
his
peace
from
grief
and
confusion
and
helplessness
for
of
wizardry
he
knew
nought
at
last
the
maid
spake
again
and
said
nevertheless
we
will
not
die
redeless
now
thou
must
look
to
this
that
from
henceforward
it
is
thee
and
not
the
king
son
whom
she
desireth
and
that
so
much
the
more
that
she
hath
not
set
eyes
on
thee
remember
this
whatsoever
her
seeming
may
be
to
thee
now
therefore
shall
the
king
son
be
free
though
he
know
it
not
to
cast
his
love
on
whomso
he
will
and
in
a
way
i
also
shall
be
free
to
yeasay
him
though
forsooth
so
fulfilled
is
she
with
malice
and
spite
that
even
then
she
may
turn
round
on
me
to
punish
me
for
doing
that
which
she
would
have
me
do
now
let
me
think
of
it
then
was
she
silent
a
good
while
and
spoke
at
last
yea
all
things
are
perilous
and
a
perilous
rede
i
have
thought
of
whereof
i
will
not
tell
thee
as
yet
so
waste
not
the
short
while
by
asking
me
at
least
the
worst
will
be
no
worse
than
what
shall
come
if
we
strive
not
against
it
and
now
my
friend
amongst
perils
it
is
growing
more
and
more
perilous
that
we
twain
should
be
longer
together
but
i
would
say
one
thing
yet
and
maybe
another
thereafter
thou
hast
cast
thy
love
upon
one
who
will
be
true
to
thee
whatsoever
may
befall
yet
is
she
a
guileful
creature
and
might
not
help
it
her
life
long
and
now
for
thy
very
sake
must
needs
be
more
guileful
now
than
ever
before
and
as
for
me
the
guileful
my
love
have
i
cast
upon
a
lovely
man
and
one
true
and
simple
and
a
heart
but
at
such
a
pinch
is
he
that
if
he
withstand
all
temptation
his
withstanding
may
belike
undo
both
him
and
me
therefore
swear
we
both
of
us
that
by
both
of
us
shall
all
guile
and
all
falling
away
be
forgiven
on
the
day
when
we
shall
be
free
to
love
each
the
other
as
our
hearts
will
walter
cried
out
o
love
i
swear
it
indeed
thou
art
my
hallow
and
i
will
swear
it
as
on
the
relics
of
a
hallow
on
thy
hands
and
thy
feet
i
swear
it
the
words
seemed
to
her
a
dear
caress
and
she
laughed
and
blushed
and
looked
full
kindly
on
him
and
then
her
face
grew
solemn
and
she
said
on
thy
life
i
swear
it
then
she
said
now
is
there
nought
for
thee
to
do
but
to
go
hence
straight
to
the
golden
house
which
is
my
mistress
house
and
the
only
house
in
this
land
save
one
which
i
may
not
see
and
lieth
southward
no
long
way
how
she
will
deal
with
thee
i
wot
not
but
all
i
have
said
of
her
and
thee
and
the
king
son
is
true
therefore
i
say
to
thee
be
wary
and
cold
at
heart
whatsoever
outward
semblance
thou
mayst
make
if
thou
have
to
yield
thee
to
her
then
yield
rather
late
than
early
so
as
to
gain
time
yet
not
so
late
as
to
seem
shamed
in
yielding
for
sake
hold
fast
to
thy
life
my
friend
for
in
warding
that
thou
wardest
me
from
grief
without
remedy
thou
wilt
see
me
ere
long
it
may
be
it
may
be
some
days
hence
but
forget
not
that
what
i
may
do
that
i
am
doing
take
heed
also
that
thou
pay
no
more
heed
to
me
or
rather
less
than
if
thou
wert
meeting
a
maiden
of
no
account
in
the
streets
of
thine
own
town
o
my
love
barren
is
this
first
farewell
as
was
our
first
meeting
but
surely
shall
there
be
another
meeting
better
than
the
first
and
the
last
farewell
may
be
long
and
long
yet
therewith
she
stood
up
and
he
knelt
before
her
a
little
while
without
any
word
and
then
arose
and
went
his
ways
but
when
he
had
gone
a
space
he
turned
about
and
saw
her
still
standing
in
the
same
place
she
stayed
a
moment
when
she
saw
him
turn
and
then
herself
turned
about
so
he
departed
through
the
fair
land
and
his
heart
was
full
with
hope
and
fear
as
he
went
chapter
xi
walter
happeneth
on
the
mistress
it
was
but
a
little
after
noon
when
walter
left
the
maid
behind
he
steered
south
by
the
sun
as
the
maid
had
bidden
him
and
went
swiftly
for
as
a
good
knight
wending
to
battle
the
time
seemed
long
to
him
till
he
should
meet
the
foe
so
an
hour
before
sunset
he
saw
something
white
and
gay
gleaming
through
the
boles
of
the
and
presently
there
was
clear
before
him
a
most
goodly
house
builded
of
white
marble
carved
all
about
with
knots
and
imagery
and
the
carven
folk
were
all
painted
of
their
lively
colours
whether
it
were
their
raiment
or
their
flesh
and
the
housings
wherein
they
stood
all
done
with
gold
and
fair
hues
gay
were
the
windows
of
the
house
and
there
was
a
pillared
porch
before
the
great
door
with
images
betwixt
the
pillars
both
of
men
and
beasts
and
when
walter
looked
up
to
the
roof
of
the
house
he
saw
that
it
gleamed
and
shone
for
all
the
tiles
were
of
yellow
metal
which
he
deemed
to
be
of
very
gold
all
this
he
saw
as
he
went
and
tarried
not
to
gaze
upon
it
for
he
said
belike
there
will
be
time
for
me
to
look
on
all
this
before
i
die
but
he
said
also
that
though
the
house
was
not
of
the
greatest
it
was
beyond
compare
of
all
houses
of
the
world
now
he
entered
it
by
the
porch
and
came
into
a
hall
and
vaulted
over
the
walls
painted
with
gold
and
ultramarine
the
floor
dark
and
spangled
with
many
colours
and
the
windows
glazed
with
knots
and
pictures
midmost
thereof
was
a
fountain
of
gold
whence
the
water
ran
two
ways
in
runnels
spanned
twice
with
little
bridges
of
silver
long
was
that
hall
and
now
not
very
light
so
that
walter
was
come
past
the
fountain
before
he
saw
any
folk
therein
then
he
looked
up
toward
the
and
himseemed
that
a
great
light
shone
thence
and
dazzled
his
eyes
and
he
went
on
a
little
way
and
then
fell
on
his
knees
for
there
before
him
on
the
sat
that
wondrous
lady
whose
lively
image
had
been
shown
to
him
thrice
before
and
she
was
clad
in
gold
and
jewels
as
he
had
erst
seen
her
but
now
she
was
not
alone
for
by
her
side
sat
a
young
man
goodly
enough
so
far
as
walter
might
see
him
and
most
richly
clad
with
a
jewelled
sword
by
his
side
and
a
chaplet
of
gems
on
his
head
they
held
each
other
by
the
hand
and
seemed
to
be
in
dear
converse
together
but
they
spake
softly
so
that
walter
might
not
hear
what
they
said
till
at
last
the
man
spake
aloud
to
the
lady
seest
thou
not
that
there
is
a
man
in
the
hall
yea
she
said
i
see
him
yonder
kneeling
on
his
knees
let
him
come
nigher
and
give
some
account
of
himself
so
walter
stood
up
and
drew
nigh
and
stood
there
all
shamefaced
and
confused
looking
on
those
twain
and
wondering
at
the
beauty
of
the
lady
as
for
the
man
who
was
slim
and
and
for
all
his
goodliness
walter
accounted
him
little
and
nowise
deemed
him
to
look
now
the
lady
spake
not
to
walter
any
more
than
erst
but
at
last
the
man
said
why
doest
thou
not
kneel
as
thou
didst
erewhile
walter
was
on
the
point
of
giving
him
back
a
fierce
answer
but
the
lady
spake
and
said
nay
friend
it
matters
not
whether
he
kneel
or
stand
but
he
may
say
if
he
will
what
he
would
have
of
me
and
wherefore
he
is
come
hither
then
spake
walter
for
as
wroth
and
ashamed
as
he
was
lady
i
have
strayed
into
this
land
and
have
come
to
thine
house
as
i
suppose
and
if
i
be
not
welcome
i
may
well
depart
straightway
and
seek
a
way
out
of
thy
land
if
thou
wouldst
drive
me
thence
as
well
as
out
of
thine
house
thereat
the
lady
turned
and
looked
on
him
and
when
her
eyes
met
his
he
felt
a
pang
of
fear
and
desire
mingled
shoot
through
his
heart
this
time
she
spoke
to
him
but
coldly
without
either
wrath
or
any
thought
of
him
newcomer
she
said
i
have
not
bidden
thee
hither
but
here
mayst
thou
abide
a
while
if
thou
wilt
nevertheless
take
heed
that
here
is
no
king
court
there
is
forsooth
a
folk
that
serveth
me
or
it
may
be
more
than
one
of
whom
thou
wert
best
to
know
nought
of
others
i
have
but
two
servants
whom
thou
wilt
see
and
the
one
is
a
strange
creature
who
should
scare
thee
or
scathe
thee
with
a
good
will
but
of
a
good
will
shall
serve
nought
save
me
the
other
is
a
woman
a
thrall
of
little
avail
save
that
being
compelled
she
will
work
woman
service
for
me
but
whom
none
else
shall
compel
yea
but
what
is
all
this
to
thee
or
to
me
that
i
should
tell
it
to
thee
i
will
not
drive
thee
away
but
if
thine
entertainment
please
thee
not
make
no
plaint
thereof
to
me
but
depart
at
thy
will
now
is
this
talk
betwixt
us
overlong
since
as
thou
seest
i
and
this
king
son
are
in
converse
together
art
thou
a
son
nay
lady
said
walter
i
am
but
of
the
sons
of
the
merchants
it
matters
not
she
said
go
thy
ways
into
one
of
the
chambers
and
straightway
she
fell
to
the
man
who
sat
beside
her
concerning
the
singing
of
the
birds
beneath
her
window
in
the
morning
and
of
how
she
had
bathed
her
that
day
in
a
pool
of
the
woodlands
when
she
had
been
heated
with
hunting
and
so
forth
and
all
as
if
there
had
been
none
there
save
her
and
the
king
son
but
walter
departed
all
ashamed
as
though
he
had
been
a
poor
man
thrust
away
from
a
rich
kinsman
door
and
he
said
to
himself
that
this
woman
was
hateful
and
nought
and
that
she
was
little
like
to
tempt
him
despite
all
the
fairness
of
her
body
no
one
else
he
saw
in
the
house
that
even
he
found
meat
and
drink
duly
served
on
a
fair
table
and
thereafter
he
came
on
a
goodly
bed
and
all
things
needful
but
no
child
of
adam
to
do
him
service
or
bid
him
welcome
or
warning
nevertheless
he
ate
and
drank
and
slept
and
put
off
thought
of
all
these
things
till
the
morrow
all
the
more
as
he
hoped
to
see
the
kind
maiden
some
time
betwixt
sunrise
and
sunset
on
that
new
day
chapter
xii
the
wearing
of
four
days
in
the
wood
beyond
the
world
he
arose
betimes
but
found
no
one
to
greet
him
neither
was
there
any
sound
of
folk
moving
within
the
fair
house
so
he
but
broke
his
fast
and
then
went
forth
and
wandered
amongst
the
trees
till
he
found
him
a
stream
to
bathe
in
and
after
he
had
washed
the
night
off
him
he
lay
down
under
a
tree
thereby
for
a
while
but
soon
turned
back
toward
the
house
lest
perchance
the
maid
should
come
thither
and
he
should
miss
her
it
should
be
said
that
half
a
from
the
house
on
that
side
due
north
thereof
was
a
little
and
round
about
it
the
trees
were
smaller
of
kind
than
the
oaks
and
chestnuts
he
had
passed
through
before
being
mostly
of
birch
and
and
young
ash
with
small
wood
betwixt
them
so
now
he
passed
through
the
thicket
and
coming
to
the
edge
thereof
beheld
the
lady
and
the
king
son
walking
together
hand
in
hand
full
lovingly
by
seeming
he
deemed
it
unmeet
to
draw
back
and
hide
him
so
he
went
forth
past
them
toward
the
house
the
king
son
scowled
on
him
as
he
passed
but
the
lady
over
whose
beauteous
face
flickered
the
joyous
morning
smiles
took
no
more
heed
of
him
than
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
trees
of
the
wood
but
she
had
been
so
high
and
disdainful
with
him
the
evening
before
that
he
thought
little
of
that
the
twain
went
on
skirting
the
and
he
could
not
choose
but
turn
his
eyes
on
them
so
sorely
did
the
beauty
draw
them
then
befell
another
thing
for
behind
them
the
boughs
of
the
hazels
parted
and
there
stood
that
little
evil
thing
he
or
another
of
his
kind
for
he
was
quite
unclad
save
by
his
fell
of
brown
hair
and
that
he
was
girt
with
a
leathern
girdle
wherein
was
stuck
an
ugly
knife
he
stood
upright
a
moment
and
cast
his
eyes
at
walter
and
grinned
but
not
as
if
he
knew
him
and
scarce
could
walter
say
whether
it
were
the
one
he
had
seen
or
another
then
he
cast
himself
down
on
his
belly
and
fell
to
creeping
through
the
long
grass
like
a
serpent
following
the
footsteps
of
the
lady
and
her
lover
and
now
as
he
crept
walter
deemed
in
his
loathing
that
the
creature
was
liker
to
a
ferret
than
aught
else
he
crept
on
marvellous
swiftly
and
was
soon
clean
out
of
sight
but
walter
stood
staring
after
him
for
a
while
and
then
lay
down
by
the
that
he
might
watch
the
house
and
the
entry
thereof
for
he
thought
now
perchance
presently
will
the
kind
maiden
come
hither
to
comfort
me
with
a
word
or
two
but
hour
passed
by
hour
and
still
she
came
not
and
still
he
lay
there
and
thought
of
the
maid
and
longed
for
her
kindness
and
wisdom
till
he
could
not
refrain
his
tears
and
wept
for
the
lack
of
her
then
he
arose
and
went
and
sat
in
the
porch
and
was
very
downcast
of
mood
but
as
he
sat
there
back
comes
the
lady
again
the
king
son
leading
her
by
the
hand
they
entered
the
porch
and
she
passed
by
him
so
close
that
the
odour
of
her
raiment
filled
all
the
air
about
him
and
the
sleekness
of
her
side
nigh
touched
him
so
that
he
could
not
fail
to
note
that
her
garments
were
somewhat
disarrayed
and
that
she
kept
her
right
hand
for
her
left
the
king
son
held
to
her
bosom
to
hold
the
cloth
together
there
whereas
the
rich
raiment
had
been
torn
off
from
her
right
shoulder
as
they
passed
by
him
the
king
son
once
more
scowled
on
him
wordless
but
even
more
fiercely
than
before
and
again
the
lady
heeded
him
nought
after
they
had
gone
on
a
while
he
entered
the
hall
and
found
it
empty
from
end
to
end
and
no
sound
in
it
save
the
tinkling
of
the
fountain
but
there
was
victual
set
on
the
board
he
ate
and
drank
thereof
to
keep
life
lusty
within
him
and
then
went
out
again
to
the
to
watch
and
to
long
and
the
time
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
because
of
the
lack
of
the
fair
maiden
he
was
of
mind
not
to
go
into
the
house
to
his
rest
that
night
but
to
sleep
under
the
boughs
of
the
forest
but
a
little
after
sunset
he
saw
a
image
moving
amidst
the
carven
images
of
the
porch
and
the
king
son
came
forth
and
went
straight
to
him
and
said
thou
art
to
enter
the
house
and
go
into
thy
chamber
forthwith
and
by
no
means
to
go
forth
of
it
betwixt
sunset
and
sunrise
my
lady
will
not
away
with
thy
prowling
round
the
house
in
the
therewith
he
turned
away
and
went
into
the
house
again
and
walter
followed
him
soberly
remembering
how
the
maid
had
bidden
him
forbear
so
he
went
to
his
chamber
and
slept
but
amidst
of
the
night
he
awoke
and
deemed
that
he
heard
a
voice
not
far
off
so
he
crept
out
of
his
bed
and
peered
around
lest
perchance
the
maid
had
come
to
speak
with
him
but
his
chamber
was
dusk
and
empty
then
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
and
saw
the
moon
shining
bright
and
white
upon
the
greensward
and
lo
the
lady
walking
with
the
king
son
and
he
clad
in
thin
and
wanton
raiment
but
she
in
nought
else
save
what
god
had
given
her
of
long
crispy
yellow
hair
then
was
walter
ashamed
to
look
on
her
seeing
that
there
was
a
man
with
her
and
gat
him
back
to
his
bed
but
yet
a
long
while
ere
he
slept
again
he
had
the
image
before
his
eyes
of
the
fair
woman
on
the
dewy
moonlit
grass
the
next
day
matters
went
much
the
same
way
and
the
next
also
save
that
his
sorrow
was
increased
and
he
sickened
sorely
of
hope
deferred
on
the
fourth
day
also
the
forenoon
wore
as
erst
but
in
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
walter
sought
to
the
and
laid
him
down
there
hard
by
a
little
clearing
thereof
and
slept
from
very
weariness
of
grief
there
after
a
while
he
woke
with
words
still
hanging
in
his
ears
and
he
knew
at
once
that
it
was
they
twain
talking
together
the
king
son
had
just
done
his
say
and
now
it
was
the
lady
beginning
in
her
voice
low
but
strong
wherein
even
was
a
little
of
huskiness
she
said
otto
belike
it
were
well
to
have
a
little
patience
till
we
find
out
what
the
man
is
and
whence
he
cometh
it
will
always
be
easy
to
rid
us
of
him
it
is
but
a
word
to
our
and
it
will
be
done
in
a
few
minutes
patience
said
the
king
son
angrily
i
wot
not
how
to
have
patience
with
him
for
i
can
see
of
him
that
he
is
rude
and
violent
and
headstrong
and
a
wily
one
forsooth
he
had
patience
enough
with
me
the
other
even
when
i
rated
him
in
like
the
dog
that
he
is
and
he
had
no
manhood
to
say
one
word
to
me
soothly
as
he
followed
after
me
i
had
a
mind
to
turn
about
and
deal
him
a
buffet
on
the
face
to
see
if
i
could
but
draw
one
angry
word
from
him
the
lady
laughed
and
said
well
otto
i
know
not
that
which
thou
deemest
dastardy
in
him
may
be
but
prudence
and
wisdom
and
he
an
alien
far
from
his
friends
and
nigh
to
his
foes
perchance
we
shall
yet
try
him
what
he
is
meanwhile
i
rede
thee
try
him
not
with
buffets
save
he
be
weaponless
and
with
bounden
hands
or
else
i
deem
that
but
a
little
while
shalt
thou
be
fain
of
thy
blow
now
when
walter
heard
her
words
and
the
voice
wherein
they
were
said
he
might
not
forbear
being
stirred
by
them
and
to
him
all
lonely
there
they
seemed
friendly
but
he
lay
still
and
the
king
son
answered
the
lady
and
said
i
know
not
what
is
in
thine
heart
concerning
this
runagate
that
thou
shouldst
bemock
me
with
his
valiancy
whereof
thou
knowest
nought
if
thou
deem
me
unworthy
of
thee
send
me
back
safe
to
my
father
country
i
may
look
to
have
worship
there
yea
and
the
love
of
fair
women
belike
therewith
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
put
forth
his
hand
to
the
lady
to
caress
her
for
she
said
nay
lay
not
thine
hand
on
my
shoulder
for
and
now
it
is
not
the
hand
of
love
but
of
pride
and
folly
and
mastery
nay
neither
shalt
thou
rise
up
and
leave
me
until
thy
mood
is
softer
and
kinder
to
me
then
was
there
silence
betwixt
them
a
while
and
thereafter
the
son
spake
in
a
wheedling
voice
my
goddess
i
pray
thee
pardon
me
but
canst
thou
wonder
that
i
fear
thy
wearying
of
me
and
am
therefore
peevish
and
jealous
thou
so
far
above
the
queens
of
the
world
and
i
a
poor
youth
that
without
thee
were
nothing
she
answered
nought
and
he
went
on
again
was
it
not
so
o
goddess
that
this
man
of
the
sons
of
the
merchants
was
little
heedful
of
thee
and
thy
loveliness
and
thy
majesty
she
laughed
and
said
maybe
he
deemed
not
that
he
had
much
to
gain
of
us
seeing
thee
sitting
by
our
side
and
whereas
we
spake
to
him
coldly
and
sternly
and
disdainfully
withal
the
poor
youth
was
dazzled
and
shamefaced
before
us
that
we
could
see
in
the
eyes
and
the
mien
of
him
now
this
she
spoke
so
kindly
and
sweetly
that
again
was
walter
all
stirred
thereat
and
it
came
into
his
mind
that
it
might
be
she
knew
he
was
anigh
and
hearing
her
and
that
she
spake
as
much
for
him
as
for
the
king
son
but
that
one
answered
lady
didst
thou
not
see
somewhat
else
in
his
eyes
to
wit
that
they
had
but
of
late
looked
on
some
fair
woman
other
than
thee
as
for
me
i
deem
it
not
so
unlike
that
on
the
way
to
thine
hall
he
may
have
fallen
in
with
thy
maid
he
spoke
in
a
faltering
voice
as
if
shrinking
from
some
storm
that
might
come
and
forsooth
the
lady
voice
was
changed
as
she
answered
though
there
was
no
outward
heat
in
it
rather
it
was
sharp
and
eager
and
cold
at
once
she
said
yea
that
is
not
ill
thought
of
but
we
may
not
always
keep
our
thrall
in
mind
if
it
be
so
as
thou
deemest
we
shall
come
to
know
it
most
like
when
we
next
fall
in
with
her
or
if
she
hath
been
shy
this
time
then
shall
she
pay
the
heavier
for
it
for
we
will
question
her
by
the
fountain
in
the
hall
as
to
what
betid
by
the
fountain
of
the
rock
spake
the
king
son
faltering
yet
more
lady
were
it
not
better
to
question
the
man
himself
the
maid
is
and
will
not
be
speedily
quelled
into
a
true
tale
whereas
the
man
i
deem
of
no
account
no
no
said
the
lady
sharply
it
shall
not
be
then
was
she
silent
a
while
and
then
she
said
how
if
the
man
should
prove
to
be
our
master
nay
our
lady
said
the
king
son
thou
art
jesting
with
me
thou
and
thy
might
and
thy
wisdom
and
all
that
thy
wisdom
may
command
to
be
mastered
by
a
gangrel
churl
but
how
if
i
will
not
have
it
command
king
son
said
the
lady
i
tell
thee
i
know
thine
heart
but
thou
knowest
not
mine
but
be
at
peace
for
since
thou
hast
prayed
for
this
woman
nay
not
with
thy
words
i
wot
but
with
thy
trembling
hands
and
thine
anxious
eyes
and
knitted
brow
i
say
since
thou
hast
prayed
for
her
so
earnestly
she
shall
escape
this
time
but
whether
it
will
be
to
her
gain
in
the
long
run
i
misdoubt
me
see
thou
to
that
otto
thou
who
hast
held
me
in
thine
arms
so
oft
and
now
thou
mayest
depart
if
thou
wilt
it
seemed
to
walter
as
if
the
king
son
were
dumbfoundered
at
her
words
he
answered
nought
and
presently
he
rose
from
the
ground
and
went
his
ways
slowly
toward
the
house
the
lady
lay
there
a
little
while
and
then
went
her
ways
also
but
turned
away
from
the
house
toward
the
wood
at
the
other
end
thereof
whereby
walter
had
first
come
thither
as
for
walter
he
was
confused
in
mind
and
shaken
in
spirit
and
withal
he
seemed
to
see
guile
and
cruel
deeds
under
the
talk
of
those
two
and
waxed
wrathful
thereat
yet
he
said
to
himself
that
nought
might
he
do
but
was
as
one
bound
hand
and
foot
till
he
had
seen
the
maid
again
chapter
xiii
now
is
the
hunt
up
next
morning
was
he
up
betimes
but
he
was
cast
down
and
heavy
of
heart
not
looking
for
aught
else
to
betide
than
had
betid
those
last
four
days
but
otherwise
it
fell
out
for
when
he
came
down
into
the
hall
there
was
the
lady
sitting
on
the
all
alone
clad
but
in
a
coat
of
white
linen
and
she
turned
her
head
when
she
heard
his
footsteps
and
looked
on
him
and
greeted
him
and
said
come
hither
guest
so
he
went
and
stood
before
her
and
she
said
though
as
yet
thou
hast
had
no
welcome
here
and
no
honour
it
hath
not
entered
into
thine
heart
to
flee
from
us
and
to
say
sooth
that
is
well
for
thee
for
flee
away
from
our
hand
thou
mightest
not
nor
mightest
thou
depart
without
our
furtherance
but
for
this
we
can
thee
thank
that
thou
hast
abided
here
our
bidding
and
eaten
thine
heart
through
the
heavy
wearing
of
four
days
and
made
no
plaint
yet
i
can
not
deem
thee
a
dastard
thou
so
well
knit
and
shapely
of
body
so
and
bold
of
visage
wherefore
now
i
ask
thee
art
thou
willing
to
do
me
service
thereby
to
earn
thy
guesting
walter
answered
her
somewhat
faltering
at
first
for
he
was
astonished
at
the
change
which
had
come
over
her
for
now
she
spoke
to
him
in
friendly
wise
though
indeed
as
a
great
lady
would
speak
to
a
young
man
ready
to
serve
her
in
all
honour
said
he
lady
i
can
thank
thee
humbly
and
heartily
in
that
thou
biddest
me
do
thee
service
for
these
days
past
i
have
loathed
the
emptiness
of
the
hours
and
nought
better
could
i
ask
for
than
to
serve
so
glorious
a
mistress
in
all
honour
she
frowned
somewhat
and
said
thou
shalt
not
call
me
mistress
there
is
but
one
who
so
calleth
me
that
is
my
thrall
and
thou
art
none
such
thou
shalt
call
me
lady
and
i
shall
be
well
pleased
that
thou
be
my
squire
and
for
this
present
thou
shalt
serve
me
in
the
hunting
so
get
thy
gear
take
thy
bow
and
arrows
and
gird
thee
to
thy
sword
for
in
this
fair
land
may
one
find
beasts
more
perilous
than
be
buck
or
hart
i
go
now
to
array
me
we
will
depart
while
the
day
is
yet
young
for
so
make
we
the
summer
day
the
fairest
he
made
obeisance
to
her
and
she
arose
and
went
to
her
chamber
and
walter
dight
himself
and
then
abode
her
in
the
porch
and
in
less
than
an
hour
she
came
out
of
the
hall
and
walter
heart
beat
when
he
saw
that
the
maid
followed
her
hard
at
heel
and
scarce
might
he
school
his
eyes
not
to
gaze
at
his
dear
friend
she
was
clad
even
as
she
was
before
and
was
changed
in
no
wise
save
that
love
troubled
her
face
when
she
first
beheld
him
and
she
had
much
ado
to
master
it
howbeit
the
mistress
heeded
not
the
trouble
of
her
or
made
no
semblance
of
heeding
it
till
the
maiden
face
was
all
according
to
its
wont
but
this
walter
found
strange
that
after
all
that
disdain
of
the
thralldom
which
he
had
heard
of
the
mistress
and
after
all
the
threats
against
her
now
was
the
mistress
become
mild
and
debonaire
to
her
as
a
good
lady
to
her
good
maiden
when
walter
bowed
the
knee
to
her
she
turned
unto
the
maid
and
said
look
thou
my
maid
at
this
fair
new
squire
that
i
have
gotten
will
not
he
be
valiant
in
the
greenwood
and
see
whether
he
be
well
shapen
or
not
doth
he
not
touch
thine
heart
when
thou
thinkest
of
all
the
woe
and
fear
and
trouble
of
the
world
beyond
the
wood
which
he
hath
escaped
to
dwell
in
this
little
land
peaceably
and
both
by
the
mistress
and
the
maid
and
thou
my
squire
look
a
little
at
this
fair
slim
maiden
and
say
if
she
pleaseth
thee
not
didst
thou
deem
that
we
had
any
thing
so
fair
in
this
lonely
place
frank
and
kind
was
the
smile
on
her
radiant
visage
nor
did
she
seem
to
note
any
whit
the
trouble
on
walter
face
nor
how
he
strove
to
keep
his
eyes
from
the
maid
as
for
her
she
had
so
wholly
mastered
her
countenance
that
belike
she
used
her
face
guilefully
for
she
stood
as
one
humble
but
happy
with
a
smile
on
her
face
blushing
and
with
her
head
hung
down
as
if
shamefaced
before
a
goodly
young
man
a
stranger
but
the
lady
looked
upon
her
kindly
and
said
come
hither
child
and
fear
not
this
frank
and
free
young
man
who
belike
feareth
thee
a
little
and
full
certainly
feareth
me
and
yet
only
after
the
manner
of
men
and
therewith
she
took
the
maid
by
the
hand
and
drew
her
to
her
and
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
and
kissed
her
cheeks
and
her
lips
and
undid
the
lacing
of
her
gown
and
bared
a
shoulder
of
her
and
swept
away
her
skirt
from
her
feet
and
then
turned
to
walter
and
said
lo
thou
squire
is
not
this
a
lovely
thing
to
have
grown
up
amongst
our
rough
boles
what
art
thou
looking
at
the
iron
ring
there
it
is
nought
save
a
token
that
she
is
mine
and
that
i
may
not
be
without
her
then
she
took
the
maid
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
her
about
as
in
sport
and
said
go
thou
now
and
bring
hither
the
good
grey
ones
for
needs
must
we
bring
home
some
venison
whereas
this
stout
warrior
may
not
feed
on
nought
save
manchets
and
honey
so
the
maid
went
her
way
taking
care
as
walter
deemed
to
give
no
side
glance
to
him
but
he
stood
there
shamefaced
so
confused
with
all
this
openhearted
kindness
of
the
great
lady
and
with
the
fresh
sight
of
the
darling
beauty
of
the
maid
that
he
went
nigh
to
thinking
that
all
he
had
heard
since
he
had
come
to
the
porch
of
the
house
that
first
time
was
but
a
dream
of
evil
but
while
he
stood
pondering
these
matters
and
staring
before
him
as
one
mazed
the
lady
laughed
out
in
his
face
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
said
ah
our
squire
is
it
so
that
now
thou
hast
seen
my
maid
thou
wouldst
with
a
good
will
abide
behind
to
talk
with
her
but
call
to
mind
thy
word
pledged
to
me
now
and
moreover
i
tell
thee
this
for
thy
behoof
now
she
is
out
of
that
i
will
above
all
things
take
thee
away
for
there
be
other
eyes
and
they
nought
uncomely
that
look
at
whiles
on
my
thrall
and
who
knows
but
the
swords
might
be
out
if
i
take
not
the
better
heed
and
give
thee
not
every
whit
of
thy
will
as
she
spoke
and
moved
forward
he
turned
a
little
so
that
now
the
edge
of
that
was
within
his
and
he
deemed
that
once
more
he
saw
the
evil
thing
crawling
forth
from
the
thicket
then
turning
suddenly
on
the
lady
he
met
her
eyes
and
seemed
in
one
moment
of
time
to
find
a
far
other
look
in
them
than
that
of
frankness
and
kindness
though
in
a
flash
they
changed
back
again
and
she
said
merrily
and
sweetly
so
so
sir
squire
now
art
thou
awake
again
and
mayest
for
a
little
while
look
on
me
now
it
came
into
his
head
with
that
look
of
hers
all
that
might
befall
him
and
the
maid
if
he
mastered
not
his
passion
nor
did
what
he
might
to
dissemble
so
he
bent
the
knee
to
her
and
spoke
boldly
to
her
in
her
own
vein
and
said
nay
most
gracious
of
ladies
never
would
i
abide
behind
since
thou
farest
afield
but
if
my
speech
be
hampered
or
mine
eyes
stray
is
it
not
because
my
mind
is
confused
by
thy
beauty
and
the
honey
of
kind
words
which
floweth
from
thy
mouth
she
laughed
outright
at
his
word
but
not
disdainfully
and
said
this
is
well
spoken
squire
and
even
what
a
squire
should
say
to
his
liege
lady
when
the
sun
is
up
on
a
fair
morning
and
she
and
he
and
all
the
world
are
glad
she
stood
quite
near
him
as
she
spoke
her
hand
was
on
his
shoulder
and
her
eyes
shone
and
sparkled
sooth
to
say
that
excusing
of
his
confusion
was
like
enough
in
seeming
to
the
truth
for
sure
never
creature
was
fashioned
fairer
than
she
clad
she
was
for
the
greenwood
as
the
of
the
gentiles
with
her
green
gown
gathered
unto
her
girdle
and
sandals
on
her
feet
a
bow
in
her
hand
and
a
quiver
at
her
back
she
was
taller
and
bigger
of
fashion
than
the
dear
maiden
whiter
of
flesh
and
more
glorious
and
brighter
of
hair
as
a
flower
of
flowers
for
fairness
and
fragrance
she
said
thou
art
verily
a
fair
squire
before
the
hunt
is
up
and
if
thou
be
as
good
in
the
hunting
all
will
be
better
than
well
and
the
guest
will
be
welcome
but
lo
here
cometh
our
maid
with
the
good
grey
ones
go
meet
her
and
we
will
tarry
no
longer
than
for
thy
taking
the
leash
in
hand
so
walter
looked
and
saw
the
maid
coming
with
two
couple
of
great
hounds
in
the
leash
straining
against
her
as
she
came
along
he
ran
lightly
to
meet
her
wondering
if
he
should
have
a
look
or
a
from
her
but
she
let
him
take
the
white
thongs
from
her
hand
with
the
same
smile
of
shamefacedness
still
set
on
her
face
and
going
past
him
came
softly
up
to
the
lady
swaying
like
a
in
the
wind
and
stood
before
her
with
her
arms
hanging
down
by
her
sides
then
the
lady
turned
to
her
and
said
look
to
thyself
our
maid
while
we
are
away
this
fair
young
man
thou
needest
not
to
fear
indeed
for
he
is
good
and
leal
but
what
thou
shalt
do
with
the
king
son
i
wot
not
he
is
a
hot
lover
forsooth
but
a
hard
man
and
whiles
evil
is
his
mood
and
perilous
both
to
thee
and
me
and
if
thou
do
his
will
it
shall
be
ill
for
thee
and
if
thou
do
it
not
take
heed
of
him
and
let
me
and
me
only
come
between
his
wrath
and
thee
i
may
do
somewhat
for
thee
even
yesterday
he
was
instant
with
me
to
have
thee
chastised
after
the
manner
of
thralls
but
i
bade
him
keep
silence
of
such
words
and
jeered
him
and
mocked
him
till
he
went
away
from
me
peevish
and
in
anger
so
look
to
it
that
thou
fall
not
into
any
trap
of
his
contrivance
then
the
maid
cast
herself
at
the
mistress
feet
and
kissed
and
embraced
them
and
as
she
rose
up
the
lady
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
her
head
and
then
turning
to
walter
cried
out
now
squire
let
us
leave
all
these
troubles
and
wiles
and
desires
behind
us
and
flit
through
the
merry
greenwood
like
the
gentiles
of
old
days
and
therewith
she
drew
up
the
laps
of
her
gown
till
the
whiteness
of
her
knees
was
seen
and
set
off
swiftly
toward
the
wood
that
lay
south
of
the
house
and
walter
followed
marvelling
at
her
goodliness
nor
durst
he
cast
a
look
backward
to
the
maiden
for
he
knew
that
she
desired
him
and
it
was
her
only
that
he
looked
to
for
his
deliverance
from
this
house
of
guile
and
lies
chapter
xiv
the
hunting
of
the
hart
as
they
went
they
found
a
change
in
the
land
which
grew
emptier
of
big
and
trees
and
more
beset
with
thickets
from
one
of
these
they
roused
a
hart
and
walter
let
slip
his
hounds
thereafter
and
he
and
the
lady
followed
running
exceeding
swift
was
she
and
withal
so
that
walter
wondered
at
her
and
eager
she
was
in
the
chase
as
the
very
hounds
heeding
nothing
the
scratching
of
briars
or
the
whipping
of
stiff
twigs
as
she
sped
on
but
for
all
their
eager
hunting
the
quarry
outran
both
dogs
and
folk
and
gat
him
into
a
great
thicket
amidmost
whereof
was
a
wide
plash
of
water
into
the
thicket
they
followed
him
but
he
took
to
the
water
under
their
eyes
and
made
land
on
the
other
side
and
because
of
the
tangle
of
underwood
he
swam
across
much
faster
than
they
might
have
any
hope
to
come
round
on
him
and
so
were
the
hunters
left
undone
for
that
time
so
the
lady
cast
herself
down
on
the
green
grass
anigh
the
water
while
walter
blew
the
hounds
in
and
coupled
them
up
then
he
turned
round
to
her
and
lo
she
was
weeping
for
despite
that
they
had
lost
the
quarry
and
again
did
walter
wonder
that
so
little
a
matter
should
raise
a
passion
of
tears
in
her
he
durst
not
ask
what
ailed
her
or
proffer
her
solace
but
was
not
ill
apaid
by
beholding
her
loveliness
as
she
lay
presently
she
raised
up
her
head
and
turned
to
walter
and
spake
to
him
angrily
and
said
squire
why
dost
thou
stand
staring
at
me
like
a
fool
yea
lady
he
said
but
the
sight
of
thee
maketh
me
foolish
to
do
aught
else
but
to
look
on
thee
she
said
in
a
peevish
voice
tush
squire
the
day
is
too
far
spent
for
soft
and
courtly
speeches
what
was
good
there
is
nought
so
good
here
withal
i
know
more
of
thine
heart
than
thou
deemest
walter
hung
down
his
head
and
reddened
and
she
looked
on
him
and
her
face
changed
and
she
smiled
and
said
kindly
this
time
look
ye
squire
i
am
hot
and
weary
and
but
presently
it
will
be
better
with
me
for
my
knees
have
been
telling
my
shoulders
that
the
cold
water
of
this
little
lake
will
be
sweet
and
pleasant
this
summer
noonday
and
that
i
shall
forget
my
foil
when
i
have
taken
my
pleasure
therein
wherefore
go
thou
with
thine
hounds
without
the
thicket
and
there
abide
my
coming
and
i
bid
thee
look
not
aback
as
thou
goest
for
therein
were
peril
to
thee
i
shall
not
keep
thee
tarrying
long
alone
he
bowed
his
head
to
her
and
turned
and
went
his
ways
and
now
when
he
was
a
little
space
away
from
her
he
deemed
her
indeed
a
marvel
of
women
and
wellnigh
forgat
all
his
doubts
and
fears
concerning
her
whether
she
were
a
fair
image
fashioned
out
of
lies
and
guile
or
it
might
be
but
an
evil
thing
in
the
shape
of
a
goodly
woman
forsooth
when
he
saw
her
caressing
the
dear
and
friendly
maid
his
heart
all
turned
against
her
despite
what
his
eyes
and
his
ears
told
his
mind
and
she
seemed
like
as
it
were
a
serpent
enfolding
the
simplicity
of
the
body
which
he
loved
but
now
it
was
all
changed
and
he
lay
on
the
grass
and
longed
for
her
coming
which
was
delayed
for
somewhat
more
than
an
hour
then
she
came
back
to
him
smiling
and
fresh
and
cheerful
her
green
gown
let
down
to
her
heels
he
sprang
up
to
meet
her
and
she
came
close
to
him
and
spake
from
a
laughing
face
squire
hast
thou
no
meat
in
thy
wallet
for
meseemeth
i
fed
thee
when
thou
wert
hungry
the
other
day
do
thou
now
the
same
by
me
he
smiled
and
louted
to
her
and
took
his
wallet
and
brought
out
thence
bread
and
flesh
and
wine
and
spread
them
all
out
before
her
on
the
green
grass
and
then
stood
by
humbly
before
her
but
she
said
nay
my
squire
sit
down
by
me
and
eat
with
me
for
are
we
both
hunters
together
so
he
sat
down
by
her
trembling
but
neither
for
awe
of
her
greatness
nor
for
fear
and
horror
of
her
guile
and
sorcery
a
while
they
sat
there
together
after
they
had
done
their
meat
and
the
lady
fell
with
walter
concerning
the
parts
of
the
earth
and
the
manners
of
men
and
of
his
journeyings
to
and
fro
at
last
she
said
thou
hast
told
me
much
and
answered
all
my
questions
wisely
and
as
my
good
squire
should
and
that
pleaseth
me
but
now
tell
me
of
the
city
wherein
thou
wert
born
and
bred
a
city
whereof
thou
hast
hitherto
told
me
nought
lady
he
said
it
is
a
fair
and
a
great
city
and
to
many
it
seemeth
lovely
but
i
have
left
it
and
now
it
is
nothing
to
me
hast
thou
not
kindred
there
said
she
yea
said
he
and
foemen
withal
and
a
false
woman
waylayeth
my
life
there
and
what
was
she
said
the
lady
said
walter
she
was
but
my
wife
was
she
fair
said
the
lady
walter
looked
on
her
a
while
and
then
said
i
was
going
to
say
that
she
was
wellnigh
as
fair
as
thou
but
that
may
scarce
be
yet
was
she
very
fair
but
now
kind
and
gracious
lady
i
will
say
this
word
to
thee
i
marvel
that
thou
askest
so
many
things
concerning
the
city
of
langton
on
holm
where
i
was
born
and
where
are
my
kindred
yet
for
meseemeth
that
thou
knowest
it
thyself
i
know
it
i
said
the
lady
what
then
thou
knowest
it
not
said
walter
spake
the
lady
and
some
of
her
old
disdain
was
in
her
words
dost
thou
deem
that
i
wander
about
the
world
and
its
like
one
of
the
nay
i
dwell
in
the
wood
beyond
the
world
and
nowhere
else
what
hath
put
this
word
into
thy
mouth
he
said
pardon
me
lady
if
i
have
misdone
but
thus
it
was
mine
own
eyes
beheld
thee
going
down
the
quays
of
our
city
and
thence
a
and
the
ship
sailed
out
of
the
haven
and
first
of
all
went
a
strange
dwarf
whom
i
have
seen
here
and
then
thy
maid
and
then
went
thy
gracious
and
lovely
body
the
lady
face
changed
as
he
spoke
and
she
turned
red
and
then
pale
and
set
her
teeth
but
she
refrained
her
and
said
squire
i
see
of
thee
that
thou
art
no
liar
nor
light
of
wit
therefore
i
suppose
that
thou
hast
verily
seen
some
appearance
of
me
but
never
have
i
been
in
langton
nor
thought
thereof
nor
known
that
such
a
stead
there
was
until
thou
namedst
it
now
wherefore
i
deem
that
an
enemy
hath
cast
the
shadow
of
me
on
the
air
of
that
land
yea
my
lady
said
walter
and
what
enemy
mightest
thou
have
to
have
done
this
she
was
slow
of
answer
but
spake
at
last
from
a
quivering
mouth
of
anger
knowest
thou
not
the
saw
that
a
man
foes
are
they
of
his
own
house
if
i
find
out
for
a
truth
who
hath
done
this
the
said
enemy
shall
have
an
evil
hour
with
me
again
she
was
silent
and
she
clenched
her
hands
and
strained
her
limbs
in
the
heat
of
her
anger
so
that
walter
was
afraid
of
her
and
all
his
misgivings
came
back
to
his
heart
again
and
he
repented
that
he
had
told
her
so
much
but
in
a
little
while
all
that
trouble
and
wrath
seemed
to
flow
off
her
and
again
was
she
of
good
cheer
and
kind
and
sweet
to
him
and
she
said
but
in
sooth
however
it
may
be
i
thank
thee
my
squire
and
friend
for
telling
me
hereof
and
surely
no
wyte
do
i
lay
on
thee
and
moreover
is
it
not
this
vision
which
hath
brought
thee
hither
so
it
is
lady
said
he
then
have
we
to
thank
it
said
the
lady
and
thou
art
welcome
to
our
land
and
therewith
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
he
took
it
on
his
knees
and
kissed
it
and
then
it
was
as
if
a
iron
had
run
through
his
heart
and
he
felt
faint
and
bowed
down
his
head
but
he
held
her
hand
yet
and
kissed
it
many
times
and
the
wrist
and
the
arm
and
knew
not
where
he
was
but
she
drew
a
little
away
from
him
and
arose
and
said
now
is
the
day
wearing
and
if
we
are
to
bear
back
any
venison
we
must
buckle
to
the
work
so
arise
squire
and
take
the
hounds
and
come
with
me
for
not
far
off
is
a
little
thicket
which
mostly
harbours
foison
of
deer
great
and
small
let
us
come
our
ways
chapter
xv
the
slaying
of
the
quarry
so
they
walked
on
quietly
thence
some
half
a
mile
and
ever
the
lady
would
have
walter
to
walk
by
her
side
and
not
follow
a
little
behind
her
as
was
meet
for
a
servant
to
do
and
she
touched
his
hand
at
whiles
as
she
showed
him
beast
and
fowl
and
tree
and
the
sweetness
of
her
body
overcame
him
so
that
for
a
while
he
thought
of
nothing
save
her
now
when
they
were
come
to
the
she
turned
to
him
and
said
squire
i
am
no
ill
woodman
so
that
thou
mayst
trust
me
that
we
shall
not
be
brought
to
shame
the
second
time
and
i
shall
do
sagely
so
nock
an
arrow
to
thy
bow
and
abide
me
here
and
stir
not
hence
for
i
shall
enter
this
thicket
without
the
hounds
and
arouse
the
quarry
for
thee
and
see
that
thou
be
brisk
and
and
then
shalt
thou
have
a
reward
of
me
therewith
she
drew
up
her
skirts
through
her
girdle
again
took
her
bent
bow
in
her
hand
and
drew
an
arrow
out
of
the
quiver
and
stepped
lightly
into
the
thicket
leaving
him
longing
for
the
sight
of
her
as
he
hearkened
to
the
tread
of
her
feet
on
the
dry
leaves
and
the
rustling
of
the
brake
as
she
thrust
through
it
thus
he
stood
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
he
heard
a
kind
of
gibbering
cry
without
words
yet
as
of
a
woman
coming
from
the
thicket
and
while
his
heart
was
yet
gathering
the
thought
that
something
had
gone
amiss
he
glided
swiftly
but
with
little
stir
into
the
brake
he
had
gone
but
a
little
way
ere
he
saw
the
lady
standing
there
in
a
narrow
clearing
her
face
pale
as
death
her
knees
cleaving
together
her
body
swaying
and
tottering
her
hands
hanging
down
and
the
bow
and
arrow
fallen
to
the
ground
and
ten
yards
before
her
a
yellow
creature
crouching
flat
to
the
earth
and
slowly
drawing
nigher
he
stopped
short
one
arrow
was
already
notched
to
the
string
and
another
hung
loose
to
the
lesser
fingers
of
his
he
raised
his
right
hand
and
drew
and
loosed
in
a
twinkling
the
shaft
flew
close
to
the
lady
side
and
straightway
all
the
wood
rung
with
a
huge
roar
as
the
yellow
lion
turned
about
to
bite
at
the
shaft
which
had
sunk
deep
into
him
behind
the
shoulder
as
if
a
bolt
out
of
the
heavens
had
smitten
him
but
straightway
had
walter
loosed
again
and
then
throwing
down
his
bow
he
ran
forward
with
his
drawn
sword
gleaming
in
his
hand
while
the
lion
weltered
and
rolled
but
had
no
might
to
move
forward
then
walter
went
up
to
him
warily
and
thrust
him
through
to
the
heart
and
leapt
aback
lest
the
beast
might
yet
have
life
in
him
to
smite
but
he
left
his
struggling
his
huge
voice
died
out
and
he
lay
there
moveless
before
the
hunter
walter
abode
a
little
facing
him
and
then
turned
about
to
the
lady
and
she
had
fallen
down
in
a
heap
whereas
she
stood
and
lay
there
all
huddled
up
and
voiceless
so
he
knelt
down
by
her
and
lifted
up
her
head
and
bade
her
arise
for
the
foe
was
slain
and
after
a
little
she
stretched
out
her
limbs
and
turned
about
on
the
grass
and
seemed
to
sleep
and
the
colour
came
into
her
face
again
and
it
grew
soft
and
a
little
smiling
thus
she
lay
awhile
and
walter
sat
by
her
watching
her
till
at
last
she
opened
her
eyes
and
sat
up
and
knew
him
and
smiling
on
him
said
what
hath
befallen
squire
that
i
have
slept
and
dreamed
he
answered
nothing
till
her
memory
came
back
to
her
and
then
she
arose
trembling
and
pale
and
said
let
us
leave
this
wood
for
the
enemy
is
therein
and
she
hastened
away
before
him
till
they
came
out
at
the
whereas
the
hounds
had
been
left
and
they
were
standing
there
uneasy
and
whining
so
walter
coupled
them
while
the
lady
stayed
not
but
went
away
swiftly
homeward
and
walter
followed
at
last
she
stayed
her
swift
feet
and
turned
round
on
walter
and
said
squire
come
hither
so
did
he
and
she
said
i
am
weary
again
let
us
sit
under
this
tree
and
rest
us
so
they
sat
down
and
she
sat
looking
between
her
knees
a
while
and
at
last
she
said
why
didst
thou
not
bring
the
lion
hide
he
said
lady
i
will
go
back
and
flay
the
beast
and
bring
on
the
hide
and
he
arose
therewith
but
she
caught
him
by
the
skirts
and
drew
him
down
and
said
nay
thou
shalt
not
go
abide
with
me
sit
down
again
he
did
so
and
she
said
thou
shalt
not
go
from
me
for
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
used
to
looking
on
the
face
of
death
she
grew
pale
as
she
spoke
and
set
a
hand
to
her
breast
and
sat
so
a
while
without
speaking
at
last
she
turned
to
him
smiling
and
said
how
was
it
with
the
aspect
of
me
when
i
stood
before
the
peril
of
the
enemy
and
she
laid
a
hand
upon
his
o
gracious
one
quoth
he
thou
wert
as
ever
full
lovely
but
i
feared
for
thee
she
moved
not
her
hand
from
his
and
she
said
good
and
true
squire
i
said
ere
i
entered
the
thicket
now
that
i
would
reward
thee
if
thou
slewest
the
quarry
he
is
dead
though
thou
hast
left
the
skin
behind
upon
the
carcase
ask
now
thy
reward
but
take
time
to
think
what
it
shall
be
he
felt
her
hand
warm
upon
his
and
drew
in
the
sweet
odour
of
her
mingled
with
the
woodland
scents
under
the
hot
sun
of
the
afternoon
and
his
heart
was
clouded
with
manlike
desire
of
her
and
it
was
a
near
thing
but
he
had
spoken
and
craved
of
her
the
reward
of
the
freedom
of
her
maid
and
that
he
might
depart
with
her
into
other
lands
but
as
his
mind
wavered
betwixt
this
and
that
the
lady
who
had
been
eyeing
him
keenly
drew
her
hand
away
from
him
and
therewith
doubt
and
fear
flowed
into
his
mind
and
he
refrained
him
of
speech
then
she
laughed
merrily
and
said
the
good
squire
is
shamefaced
he
feareth
a
lady
more
than
a
lion
will
it
be
a
reward
to
thee
if
i
bid
thee
to
kiss
my
cheek
therewith
she
leaned
her
face
toward
him
and
he
kissed
her
and
then
sat
gazing
on
her
wondering
what
should
betide
to
him
on
the
morrow
then
she
arose
and
said
come
squire
and
let
us
home
be
not
abashed
there
shall
be
other
rewards
hereafter
so
they
went
their
ways
quietly
and
it
was
nigh
sunset
against
they
entered
the
house
again
walter
looked
round
for
the
maid
but
beheld
her
not
and
the
lady
said
to
him
i
go
to
my
chamber
and
now
is
thy
service
over
for
this
day
then
she
nodded
to
him
friendly
and
went
her
ways
chapter
xvi
of
the
king
son
and
the
maid
but
as
for
walter
he
went
out
of
the
house
again
and
fared
slowly
over
the
woodlawns
till
he
came
to
another
close
thicket
or
brake
he
entered
from
mere
wantonness
or
that
he
might
be
the
more
apart
and
hidden
so
as
to
think
over
his
case
there
he
lay
down
under
the
thick
boughs
but
could
not
so
herd
his
thoughts
that
they
would
dwell
steady
in
looking
into
what
might
come
to
him
within
the
next
days
rather
visions
of
those
two
women
and
the
monster
did
but
float
before
him
and
fear
and
desire
and
the
hope
of
life
ran
to
and
fro
in
his
mind
as
he
lay
thus
he
heard
footsteps
drawing
near
and
he
looked
between
the
boughs
and
though
the
sun
had
just
set
he
could
see
close
by
him
a
man
and
a
woman
going
slowly
and
they
hand
in
hand
at
first
he
deemed
it
would
be
the
king
son
and
the
lady
but
presently
he
saw
that
it
was
the
king
son
indeed
but
that
it
was
the
maid
whom
he
was
holding
by
the
hand
and
now
he
saw
of
him
that
his
eyes
were
bright
with
desire
and
of
her
that
she
was
very
pale
yet
when
he
heard
her
begin
to
speak
it
was
in
a
steady
voice
that
she
said
king
son
thou
hast
threatened
me
oft
and
unkindly
and
now
thou
threatenest
me
again
and
no
less
unkindly
but
whatever
were
thy
need
herein
before
now
is
there
no
more
need
for
my
mistress
of
whom
thou
wert
weary
is
now
grown
weary
of
thee
and
belike
will
not
now
reward
me
for
drawing
thy
love
to
me
as
once
she
would
have
done
to
wit
before
the
coming
of
this
stranger
therefore
i
say
since
i
am
but
a
thrall
poor
and
helpless
betwixt
you
two
mighty
ones
i
have
no
choice
but
to
do
thy
will
as
she
spoke
she
looked
all
round
about
her
as
one
distraught
by
the
anguish
of
fear
walter
amidst
of
his
wrath
and
grief
had
wellnigh
drawn
his
sword
and
rushed
out
of
his
lair
upon
the
king
son
but
he
deemed
it
sure
that
so
doing
he
should
undo
the
maid
altogether
and
himself
also
belike
so
he
refrained
him
though
it
were
a
hard
matter
the
maid
had
stayed
her
feet
now
close
to
where
walter
lay
some
five
yards
from
him
only
and
he
doubted
whether
she
saw
him
not
from
where
she
stood
as
to
the
king
son
he
was
so
intent
upon
the
maid
and
so
greedy
of
her
beauty
that
it
was
not
like
that
he
saw
anything
now
moreover
walter
looked
and
deemed
that
he
beheld
something
through
the
grass
and
bracken
on
the
other
side
of
those
two
an
ugly
brown
and
yellow
body
which
if
it
were
not
some
beast
of
the
foumart
kind
must
needs
be
the
monstrous
dwarf
or
one
of
his
kin
and
the
flesh
crept
upon
walter
bones
with
the
horror
of
him
but
the
king
son
spoke
unto
the
maid
sweetling
i
shall
take
the
gift
thou
givest
me
neither
shall
i
threaten
thee
any
more
howbeit
thou
givest
it
not
very
gladly
or
graciously
she
smiled
on
him
with
her
lips
alone
for
her
eyes
were
wandering
and
haggard
my
lord
she
said
is
not
this
the
manner
of
women
well
he
said
i
say
that
i
will
take
thy
love
even
so
given
yet
let
me
hear
again
that
thou
lovest
not
that
vile
newcomer
and
that
thou
hast
not
seen
him
save
this
morning
along
with
my
lady
nay
now
thou
shalt
swear
it
what
shall
i
swear
by
she
said
quoth
he
thou
shalt
swear
by
my
body
and
therewith
he
thrust
himself
close
up
against
her
but
she
drew
her
hand
from
his
and
laid
it
on
his
breast
and
said
i
swear
it
by
thy
body
he
smiled
on
her
licorously
and
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
kissed
her
face
many
times
and
then
stood
aloof
from
her
and
said
now
have
i
had
hansel
but
tell
me
when
shall
i
come
to
thee
she
spoke
out
clearly
within
three
days
at
furthest
i
will
do
thee
to
wit
of
the
day
and
the
hour
or
the
day
after
he
kissed
her
once
more
and
said
forget
it
not
or
the
threat
holds
good
and
therewith
he
turned
about
and
went
his
ways
toward
the
house
and
walter
saw
the
thing
creeping
after
him
in
the
gathering
dusk
as
for
the
maid
she
stood
for
a
while
without
moving
and
looking
after
the
king
son
and
the
creature
that
followed
him
then
she
turned
about
to
where
walter
lay
and
lightly
put
aside
the
boughs
and
walter
leapt
up
and
they
stood
face
to
face
she
said
softly
but
eagerly
friend
touch
me
not
yet
he
spake
not
but
looked
on
her
sternly
she
said
thou
art
angry
with
me
still
he
spake
not
but
she
said
friend
this
at
least
i
will
pray
thee
not
to
play
with
life
and
death
with
happiness
and
misery
dost
thou
not
remember
the
oath
which
we
swore
each
to
each
but
a
little
while
ago
and
dost
thou
deem
that
i
have
changed
in
these
few
days
is
thy
mind
concerning
thee
and
me
the
same
as
it
was
if
it
be
not
so
now
tell
me
for
now
have
i
the
mind
to
do
as
if
neither
thou
nor
i
are
changed
to
each
other
whoever
may
have
kissed
mine
unwilling
lips
or
whomsoever
thy
lips
may
have
kissed
but
if
thou
hast
changed
and
wilt
no
longer
give
me
thy
love
nor
crave
mine
then
shall
this
steel
and
she
drew
a
sharp
knife
from
her
girdle
be
for
the
fool
and
the
dastard
who
hath
made
thee
wroth
with
me
my
friend
and
my
friend
that
i
deemed
i
had
won
and
then
let
come
what
will
come
but
if
thou
be
nought
changed
and
the
oath
yet
holds
then
when
a
little
while
hath
passed
may
we
thrust
all
evil
and
guile
and
grief
behind
us
and
long
joy
shall
lie
before
us
and
long
life
and
all
honour
in
death
if
only
thou
wilt
do
as
i
bid
thee
o
my
dear
and
my
friend
and
my
first
friend
he
looked
on
her
and
his
breast
heaved
up
as
all
the
sweetness
of
her
kind
love
took
hold
on
him
and
his
face
changed
and
the
tears
filled
his
eyes
and
ran
over
and
rained
down
before
her
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
her
then
she
said
exceeding
sweetly
now
indeed
i
see
that
it
is
well
with
me
yea
and
with
thee
also
a
sore
pain
it
is
to
me
that
not
even
now
may
i
take
thine
hand
and
cast
mine
arms
about
thee
and
kiss
the
lips
that
love
me
but
so
it
has
to
be
my
dear
even
so
i
were
fain
to
stand
here
long
before
thee
even
if
we
spake
no
more
word
to
each
other
but
abiding
here
is
perilous
for
there
is
ever
an
evil
spy
upon
my
doings
who
has
now
as
i
deem
followed
the
king
son
to
the
house
but
who
will
return
when
he
has
tracked
him
home
thither
so
we
must
sunder
but
belike
there
is
yet
time
for
a
word
or
two
first
the
rede
which
i
had
thought
on
for
our
deliverance
is
now
afoot
though
i
durst
not
tell
thee
thereof
nor
have
time
thereto
but
this
much
shall
i
tell
thee
that
whereas
great
is
the
craft
of
my
mistress
in
wizardry
yet
i
also
have
some
little
craft
therein
and
this
which
she
hath
not
to
change
the
aspect
of
folk
so
utterly
that
they
seem
other
than
they
verily
are
yea
so
that
one
may
have
the
aspect
of
another
now
the
next
thing
is
this
whatsoever
my
mistress
may
bid
thee
do
her
will
therein
with
no
more
than
thou
deemest
may
please
her
and
the
next
thing
wheresoever
thou
mayst
meet
me
speak
not
to
me
make
no
sign
to
me
even
when
i
seem
to
be
all
alone
till
i
stoop
down
and
touch
the
ring
on
my
ankle
with
my
right
hand
but
if
i
do
so
then
stay
thee
without
fail
till
i
speak
the
last
thing
i
will
say
to
thee
dear
friend
ere
we
both
go
our
ways
this
it
is
when
we
are
free
and
thou
knowest
all
that
i
have
done
i
pray
thee
deem
me
not
evil
and
wicked
and
be
not
wroth
with
me
for
my
deed
whereas
thou
wottest
well
that
i
am
not
in
like
plight
with
other
women
i
have
heard
tell
that
when
the
knight
goeth
to
the
war
and
hath
overcome
his
foes
by
the
shearing
of
swords
and
guileful
tricks
and
hath
come
back
home
to
his
own
folk
they
praise
him
and
bless
him
and
crown
him
with
flowers
and
boast
of
him
before
god
in
the
minster
for
his
deliverance
of
friend
and
folk
and
city
why
shouldst
thou
be
worse
to
me
than
this
now
is
all
said
my
dear
and
my
friend
farewell
farewell
therewith
she
turned
and
went
her
ways
toward
the
house
in
all
speed
but
making
somewhat
of
a
compass
and
when
she
was
gone
walter
knelt
down
and
kissed
the
place
where
her
feet
had
been
and
arose
thereafter
and
made
his
way
toward
the
house
he
also
but
slowly
and
staying
oft
on
his
way
chapter
xvii
of
the
house
and
the
pleasance
in
the
wood
on
the
morrow
morning
walter
loitered
a
while
about
the
house
till
the
morn
was
grown
old
and
then
about
noon
he
took
his
bow
and
arrows
and
went
into
the
woods
to
the
northward
to
get
him
some
venison
he
went
somewhat
far
ere
he
shot
him
a
fawn
and
then
he
sat
him
down
to
rest
under
the
shade
of
a
great
for
it
was
not
far
past
the
hottest
of
the
day
he
looked
around
thence
and
saw
below
him
a
little
dale
with
a
pleasant
stream
running
through
it
and
he
bethought
him
of
bathing
therein
so
he
went
down
and
had
his
pleasure
of
the
water
and
the
willowy
banks
for
he
lay
naked
a
while
on
the
grass
by
the
lip
of
the
water
for
joy
of
the
flickering
shade
and
the
little
breeze
that
ran
over
the
ripples
of
the
stream
then
he
did
on
his
raiment
and
began
to
come
his
ways
up
the
bent
but
had
scarce
gone
three
steps
ere
he
saw
a
woman
coming
towards
him
from
downstream
his
heart
came
into
his
mouth
when
he
saw
her
for
she
stooped
and
reached
down
her
arm
as
if
she
would
lay
her
hand
on
her
ankle
so
that
at
first
he
deemed
it
had
been
the
maid
but
at
the
second
he
saw
that
it
was
the
mistress
she
stood
still
and
looked
on
him
so
that
he
deemed
she
would
have
him
come
to
her
so
he
went
to
meet
her
and
grew
somewhat
shamefaced
as
he
drew
nigher
and
wondered
at
her
for
now
was
she
clad
but
in
one
garment
of
some
dark
grey
silky
stuff
embroidered
with
as
it
were
a
garland
of
flowers
about
the
middle
but
which
was
so
thin
that
as
the
wind
drifted
it
from
side
and
limb
it
hid
her
no
more
but
for
the
said
garland
than
if
water
were
running
over
her
her
face
was
full
of
smiling
joy
and
content
as
she
spake
to
him
in
a
kind
caressing
voice
and
said
i
give
thee
good
day
good
squire
and
well
art
thou
met
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
knelt
down
before
her
and
kissed
it
and
abode
still
upon
his
knees
and
hanging
down
his
head
but
she
laughed
outright
and
stooped
down
to
him
and
put
her
hand
to
his
arms
and
raised
him
up
and
said
to
him
what
is
this
my
squire
that
thou
kneelest
to
me
as
to
an
idol
he
said
faltering
i
wot
not
but
perchance
thou
art
an
idol
and
i
fear
thee
what
she
said
more
than
yesterday
whenas
thou
sawest
me
afraid
said
he
yea
for
that
now
i
see
thee
unhidden
and
meseemeth
there
hath
been
none
such
since
the
old
days
of
the
gentiles
she
said
hast
thou
not
yet
bethought
thee
of
a
gift
to
crave
of
me
a
reward
for
the
slaying
of
mine
enemy
and
the
saving
of
me
from
death
o
my
lady
he
said
even
so
much
would
i
have
done
for
any
other
lady
or
forsooth
for
any
poor
man
for
so
my
manhood
would
have
bidden
me
speak
not
of
gifts
to
me
then
moreover
and
he
reddened
therewith
and
his
voice
faltered
didst
thou
not
give
me
my
sweet
reward
yesterday
what
more
durst
i
ask
she
held
her
peace
awhile
and
looked
on
him
keenly
and
he
reddened
under
her
gaze
then
wrath
came
into
her
face
and
she
reddened
and
knit
her
brows
and
spake
to
him
in
a
voice
of
anger
and
said
nay
what
is
this
it
is
growing
in
my
mind
that
thou
deemest
the
gift
of
me
unworthy
thou
an
alien
an
outcast
one
endowed
with
the
little
wisdom
of
the
world
without
the
wood
and
here
i
stand
before
thee
all
glorious
in
my
nakedness
and
so
fulfilled
of
wisdom
that
i
can
make
this
wilderness
to
any
whom
i
love
more
full
of
joy
than
the
kingdoms
and
cities
of
the
world
and
thou
ah
but
it
is
the
enemy
that
hath
done
this
and
made
the
guileless
guileful
yet
will
i
have
the
upper
hand
at
least
though
thou
suffer
for
it
and
i
suffer
for
thee
walter
stood
before
her
with
hanging
head
and
he
put
forth
his
hands
as
if
praying
off
her
anger
and
pondered
what
answer
he
should
make
for
now
he
feared
for
himself
and
the
maid
so
at
last
he
looked
up
to
her
and
said
boldly
nay
lady
i
know
what
thy
words
mean
whereas
i
remember
thy
first
welcome
of
me
i
wot
forsooth
that
thou
wouldst
call
me
and
of
no
account
and
unworthy
to
touch
the
hem
of
thy
raiment
and
that
i
have
been
and
guilty
towards
thee
and
doubtless
this
is
sooth
and
i
have
deserved
thine
anger
but
i
will
not
ask
thee
to
pardon
me
for
i
have
done
but
what
i
must
needs
she
looked
on
him
calmly
now
and
without
any
wrath
but
rather
as
if
she
would
read
what
was
written
in
his
inmost
heart
then
her
face
changed
into
joyousness
again
and
she
smote
her
palms
together
and
cried
out
this
is
but
foolish
talk
for
yesterday
did
i
see
thy
valiancy
and
day
i
have
seen
thy
goodliness
and
i
say
that
though
thou
mightest
not
be
good
enough
for
a
fool
woman
of
the
earthly
baronage
yet
art
thou
good
enough
for
me
the
wise
and
the
mighty
and
the
lovely
and
whereas
thou
sayest
that
i
gave
thee
but
disdain
when
first
thou
camest
to
us
grudge
not
against
me
therefor
because
it
was
done
but
to
prove
thee
and
now
thou
art
proven
then
again
he
knelt
down
before
her
and
embraced
her
knees
and
again
she
raised
him
up
and
let
her
arm
hang
down
over
his
shoulder
and
her
cheek
brush
his
cheek
and
she
kissed
his
mouth
and
said
hereby
is
all
forgiven
both
thine
offence
and
mine
and
now
cometh
joy
and
merry
days
therewith
her
smiling
face
grew
grave
and
she
stood
before
him
looking
stately
and
gracious
and
kind
at
once
and
she
took
his
hand
and
said
thou
mightest
deem
my
chamber
in
the
golden
house
of
the
wood
since
thou
art
no
masterful
man
so
now
hast
thou
chosen
well
the
place
wherein
to
meet
me
for
hard
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
is
a
bower
of
pleasance
which
forsooth
not
every
one
who
cometh
to
this
land
may
find
there
shall
i
be
to
thee
as
one
of
the
country
damsels
of
thine
own
land
and
thou
shalt
not
be
abashed
she
sidled
up
to
him
as
she
spoke
and
would
he
would
he
not
her
sweet
voice
tickled
his
very
soul
with
pleasure
and
she
looked
aside
on
him
happy
and
so
they
crossed
the
stream
by
the
shallow
below
the
pool
wherein
walter
had
bathed
and
within
a
little
they
came
upon
a
tall
fence
of
and
a
simple
gate
therein
the
lady
opened
the
same
and
they
entered
thereby
into
a
close
all
planted
as
a
most
fair
garden
with
hedges
of
rose
and
woodbine
and
with
and
long
ways
of
green
grass
betwixt
borders
of
lilies
and
and
other
sweet
and
a
branch
of
the
stream
which
they
had
crossed
erewhile
wandered
through
that
garden
and
in
the
midst
was
a
little
house
built
of
post
and
pan
and
thatched
with
yellow
straw
as
if
it
were
new
done
then
walter
looked
this
way
and
that
and
wondered
at
first
and
tried
to
think
in
his
mind
what
should
come
next
and
how
matters
would
go
with
him
but
his
thought
would
not
dwell
steady
on
any
other
matter
than
the
beauty
of
the
lady
amidst
the
beauty
of
the
garden
and
withal
she
was
now
grown
so
sweet
and
kind
and
even
somewhat
timid
and
shy
with
him
that
scarce
did
he
know
whose
hand
he
held
or
whose
fragrant
bosom
and
sleek
side
went
so
close
to
him
so
they
wandered
here
and
there
through
the
waning
of
the
day
and
when
they
entered
at
last
into
the
cool
dusk
house
then
they
loved
and
played
together
as
if
they
were
a
pair
of
lovers
guileless
with
no
fear
for
the
morrow
and
no
seeds
of
enmity
and
death
sown
betwixt
them
chapter
xviii
the
maid
gives
walter
tryst
now
on
the
morrow
when
walter
was
awake
he
found
there
was
no
one
lying
beside
him
and
the
day
was
no
longer
very
young
so
he
arose
and
went
through
the
garden
from
end
to
end
and
all
about
and
there
was
none
there
and
albeit
that
he
dreaded
to
meet
the
lady
there
yet
was
he
sad
at
heart
and
fearful
of
what
might
betide
howsoever
he
found
the
gate
whereby
they
had
entered
yesterday
and
he
went
out
into
the
little
dale
but
when
he
had
gone
a
step
or
two
he
turned
about
and
could
see
neither
garden
nor
fence
nor
any
sign
of
what
he
had
seen
thereof
but
lately
he
knit
his
brow
and
stood
still
to
think
of
it
and
his
heart
grew
the
heavier
thereby
but
presently
he
went
his
ways
and
crossed
the
stream
but
had
scarce
come
up
on
to
the
grass
on
the
further
side
ere
he
saw
a
woman
coming
to
meet
him
and
at
first
full
as
he
was
of
the
tide
of
yesterday
and
the
wondrous
garden
deemed
that
it
would
be
the
lady
but
the
woman
stayed
her
feet
and
stooping
laid
a
hand
on
her
right
ankle
and
he
saw
that
it
was
the
maid
he
drew
anigh
to
her
and
saw
that
she
was
nought
so
sad
of
countenance
as
the
last
time
she
had
met
him
but
flushed
of
cheek
and
as
he
came
up
to
her
she
made
a
step
or
two
to
meet
him
holding
out
her
two
hands
and
then
refrained
her
and
said
smiling
ah
friend
belike
this
shall
be
the
last
time
that
i
shall
say
to
thee
touch
me
not
nay
not
so
much
as
my
hand
or
if
it
were
but
the
hem
of
my
raiment
the
joy
grew
up
in
his
heart
and
he
gazed
on
her
fondly
and
said
why
what
hath
befallen
of
late
o
friend
she
began
this
hath
befallen
but
as
he
looked
on
her
the
smile
died
from
her
face
and
she
became
deadly
pale
to
the
very
lips
she
looked
askance
to
her
left
side
whereas
ran
the
stream
and
walter
followed
her
eyes
and
deemed
for
one
instant
that
he
saw
the
misshapen
yellow
visage
of
the
dwarf
peering
round
from
a
grey
rock
but
the
next
there
was
nothing
then
the
maid
though
she
were
as
pale
as
death
went
on
in
a
clear
steady
hard
voice
wherein
was
no
joy
or
kindness
keeping
her
face
to
walter
and
her
back
to
the
stream
this
hath
befallen
friend
that
there
is
no
longer
any
need
to
refrain
thy
love
nor
mine
therefore
i
say
to
thee
come
to
my
chamber
and
it
is
the
red
chamber
over
against
thine
though
thou
knewest
it
not
an
hour
before
this
next
midnight
and
then
thy
sorrow
and
mine
shall
be
at
an
end
and
now
i
must
needs
depart
follow
me
not
but
remember
and
therewith
she
turned
about
and
fled
like
the
wind
down
the
stream
but
walter
stood
wondering
and
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
whether
it
were
for
good
or
ill
for
he
knew
now
that
she
had
paled
and
been
seized
with
terror
because
of
the
upheaving
of
the
ugly
head
and
yet
she
had
seemed
to
speak
out
the
very
thing
she
had
to
say
howsoever
it
were
he
spake
aloud
to
himself
whatever
comes
i
will
keep
tryst
with
her
then
he
drew
his
sword
and
turned
this
way
and
that
looking
all
about
if
he
might
see
any
sign
of
the
evil
thing
but
nought
might
his
eyes
behold
save
the
grass
and
the
stream
and
the
bushes
of
the
dale
so
then
still
holding
his
naked
sword
in
his
hand
he
clomb
the
bent
out
of
the
dale
for
that
was
the
only
way
he
knew
to
the
golden
house
and
when
he
came
to
the
top
and
the
summer
breeze
blew
in
his
face
and
he
looked
down
a
fair
green
slope
beset
with
goodly
oaks
and
chestnuts
he
was
refreshed
with
the
life
of
the
earth
and
he
felt
the
good
sword
in
his
fist
and
knew
that
there
was
might
and
longing
in
him
and
the
world
seemed
open
unto
him
so
he
smiled
if
it
were
somewhat
grimly
and
sheathed
his
sword
and
went
on
toward
the
house
chapter
xix
walter
goes
to
fetch
home
the
lion
hide
he
entered
the
cool
dusk
through
the
porch
and
looking
down
the
pillared
hall
saw
beyond
the
fountain
a
gleam
of
gold
and
when
he
came
past
the
said
fountain
he
looked
up
to
the
and
lo
the
lady
sitting
there
clad
in
her
queenly
raiment
she
called
to
him
and
he
came
and
she
hailed
him
and
spake
graciously
and
calmly
yet
as
if
she
knew
nought
of
him
save
as
the
leal
servant
of
her
a
high
lady
squire
she
said
we
have
deemed
it
meet
to
have
the
hide
of
the
servant
of
the
enemy
the
lion
to
wit
whom
thou
slewest
yesterday
for
a
carpet
to
our
feet
wherefore
go
now
take
thy
and
flay
the
beast
and
bring
me
home
his
skin
this
shall
be
all
thy
service
for
this
day
so
mayst
thou
do
it
at
thine
own
leisure
and
not
weary
thyself
may
good
go
with
thee
he
bent
the
knee
before
her
and
she
smiled
on
him
graciously
but
reached
out
no
hand
for
him
to
kiss
and
heeded
him
but
little
wherefore
in
spite
of
himself
and
though
he
knew
somewhat
of
her
guile
he
could
not
help
marvelling
that
this
should
be
she
who
had
lain
in
his
arms
but
of
late
howso
that
might
be
he
took
his
way
toward
the
thicket
where
he
had
slain
the
lion
and
came
thither
by
then
it
was
afternoon
at
the
hottest
of
the
day
so
he
entered
therein
and
came
to
the
very
place
whereas
the
lady
had
lain
when
she
fell
down
before
the
terror
of
the
lion
and
there
was
the
mark
of
her
body
on
the
grass
where
she
had
lain
that
while
like
as
it
were
the
form
of
a
hare
but
when
walter
went
on
to
where
he
had
slain
that
great
beast
lo
he
was
gone
and
there
was
no
sign
of
him
but
there
were
walter
own
footprints
and
the
two
shafts
which
he
had
shot
one
feathered
red
and
one
blue
he
said
at
first
belike
someone
hath
been
here
and
hath
had
the
carcase
away
then
he
laughed
in
very
despite
and
said
how
may
that
be
since
there
are
no
signs
of
dragging
away
of
so
huge
a
body
and
no
blood
or
fur
on
the
grass
if
they
had
cut
him
up
and
moreover
no
trampling
of
feet
as
if
there
had
been
many
men
at
the
deed
then
was
he
all
abashed
and
again
laughed
in
scorn
of
himself
and
said
forsooth
i
deemed
i
had
done
manly
but
now
forsooth
i
shot
nought
and
nought
there
was
before
the
sword
of
my
father
son
and
what
may
i
deem
now
but
that
this
is
a
land
of
mere
lies
and
that
there
is
nought
real
and
alive
therein
save
me
yea
belike
even
these
trees
and
the
green
grass
will
presently
depart
from
me
and
leave
me
falling
down
through
the
clouds
therewith
he
turned
away
and
gat
him
to
the
road
that
led
to
the
golden
house
wondering
what
next
should
befall
him
and
going
slowly
as
he
pondered
his
case
so
came
he
to
that
first
thicket
where
they
had
lost
their
quarry
by
water
so
he
entered
the
same
musing
and
bathed
him
in
the
pool
that
was
therein
after
he
had
wandered
about
it
awhile
and
found
nothing
new
so
again
he
set
him
to
the
homeward
road
when
the
day
was
now
waning
and
it
was
near
sunset
that
he
was
come
nigh
unto
the
house
though
it
was
hidden
from
him
as
then
by
a
low
bent
that
rose
before
him
and
there
he
abode
and
looked
about
him
now
as
he
looked
over
the
said
bent
came
the
figure
of
a
woman
who
stayed
on
the
brow
thereof
and
looked
all
about
her
and
then
ran
swiftly
down
to
meet
walter
who
saw
at
once
that
it
was
the
maid
she
made
no
stay
then
till
she
was
but
three
paces
from
him
and
then
she
stooped
down
and
made
the
sign
to
him
and
then
spake
to
him
breathlessly
and
said
hearken
but
speak
not
till
i
have
done
i
bade
thee
meeting
because
i
saw
that
there
was
one
anigh
whom
i
must
needs
beguile
but
by
thine
oath
and
thy
love
and
all
that
thou
art
i
adjure
thee
come
not
unto
me
this
night
as
i
bade
thee
but
be
hidden
in
the
outside
the
house
as
it
draws
toward
midnight
and
abide
me
there
dost
thou
hearken
and
wilt
thou
say
yes
or
no
in
haste
for
i
may
not
tarry
a
moment
of
time
who
knoweth
what
is
behind
me
yes
said
walter
hastily
but
friend
and
love
no
more
she
said
hope
the
best
and
turning
from
him
she
ran
away
swiftly
not
by
the
way
she
had
come
but
sideways
as
though
to
reach
the
house
by
fetching
a
compass
but
walter
went
slowly
on
his
way
thinking
within
himself
that
now
at
that
present
moment
there
was
nought
for
it
but
to
refrain
him
from
doing
and
to
let
others
do
yet
deemed
he
that
it
was
little
manly
to
be
as
the
pawn
upon
the
board
pushed
about
by
the
will
of
others
then
as
he
went
he
bethought
him
of
the
maiden
face
and
aspect
as
she
came
running
to
him
and
stood
before
him
for
that
minute
and
all
eagerness
he
saw
in
her
and
sore
love
of
him
and
distress
of
soul
all
blent
together
so
came
he
to
the
brow
of
the
bent
whence
he
could
see
lying
before
him
scarce
more
than
a
away
the
golden
house
now
gilded
again
and
reddened
by
the
setting
sun
and
even
therewith
came
a
gay
image
toward
him
flashing
back
the
level
rays
from
gold
and
steel
and
silver
and
lo
there
was
come
the
king
son
they
met
presently
and
the
king
son
turned
to
go
beside
him
and
said
merrily
i
give
thee
good
even
my
lady
squire
i
owe
thee
something
of
courtesy
whereas
it
is
by
thy
means
that
i
shall
be
made
happy
both
and
and
many
and
sooth
it
is
that
but
little
courtesy
have
i
done
thee
hitherto
his
face
was
full
of
joy
and
the
eyes
of
him
shone
with
gladness
he
was
a
goodly
man
but
to
walter
he
seemed
an
ill
one
and
he
hated
him
so
much
that
he
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
answer
him
but
he
refrained
himself
and
said
i
can
thee
thank
king
son
and
good
it
is
that
someone
is
happy
in
this
strange
land
art
thou
not
happy
then
squire
of
my
lady
said
the
other
walter
had
no
mind
to
show
this
man
his
heart
nay
nor
even
a
corner
thereof
for
he
deemed
him
an
enemy
so
he
smiled
sweetly
and
somewhat
foolishly
as
a
man
luckily
in
love
and
said
o
yea
yea
why
should
i
not
be
so
how
might
i
be
otherwise
yea
then
said
the
king
son
why
didst
thou
say
that
thou
wert
glad
someone
is
happy
who
is
unhappy
deemest
thou
and
he
looked
on
him
keenly
walter
answered
slowly
said
i
so
i
suppose
then
that
i
was
thinking
of
thee
for
when
first
i
saw
thee
yea
and
afterwards
thou
didst
seem
and
the
face
of
the
king
son
cleared
at
this
word
and
he
said
yea
so
it
was
for
look
you
both
ways
it
was
i
was
unfree
and
i
had
sown
the
true
desire
of
my
heart
whereas
it
waxed
not
but
now
i
am
on
the
brink
and
verge
of
freedom
and
presently
shall
my
desire
be
blossomed
nay
now
squire
i
deem
thee
a
good
fellow
though
it
may
be
somewhat
of
a
fool
so
i
will
no
more
speak
riddles
to
thee
thus
it
is
the
maid
hath
promised
me
all
mine
asking
and
is
mine
and
in
two
or
three
days
by
her
helping
also
i
shall
see
the
world
again
quoth
walter
smiling
askance
on
him
and
the
lady
what
shall
she
say
to
this
matter
the
king
son
reddened
but
smiled
falsely
enough
and
said
sir
squire
thou
knowest
enough
not
to
need
to
ask
this
why
should
i
tell
thee
that
she
accounteth
more
of
thy
little
finger
than
of
my
whole
body
now
i
tell
thee
hereof
freely
first
because
this
my
fruition
of
love
and
my
freeing
from
thralldom
is
in
a
way
of
thy
doing
for
thou
art
become
my
supplanter
and
hast
taken
thy
place
with
yonder
lovely
tyrant
fear
not
for
me
she
will
let
me
go
as
for
thyself
see
thou
to
it
but
again
i
tell
thee
hereof
because
my
heart
is
light
and
full
of
joy
and
telling
thee
will
pleasure
me
and
can
not
do
me
any
harm
for
if
thou
say
how
if
i
carry
the
tale
to
my
lady
i
answer
thou
wilt
not
for
i
know
that
thine
heart
hath
been
somewhat
set
on
the
jewel
that
my
hand
holdeth
and
thou
knowest
well
on
whose
head
the
lady
wrath
would
fall
and
that
would
be
neither
thine
nor
mine
thou
sayest
sooth
said
walter
neither
is
treason
my
wont
so
they
walked
on
silently
a
while
and
then
walter
said
but
how
if
the
maiden
had
thee
what
hadst
thou
done
then
by
the
heavens
said
the
king
son
fiercely
she
should
have
paid
for
her
then
would
i
but
he
broke
off
and
said
quietly
yet
somewhat
doggedly
why
talk
of
what
might
have
been
she
gave
me
her
pleasantly
and
sweetly
now
walter
knew
that
the
man
lied
so
he
held
his
peace
thereon
but
presently
he
said
when
thou
art
free
wilt
thou
go
to
thine
own
land
again
yea
said
the
king
son
she
will
lead
me
thither
and
wilt
thou
make
her
thy
lady
and
queen
when
thou
comest
to
thy
father
land
said
walter
the
king
son
knit
his
brow
and
said
when
i
am
in
mine
own
land
i
may
do
with
her
what
i
will
but
i
look
for
it
that
i
shall
do
no
otherwise
with
her
than
that
she
shall
be
then
the
talk
between
them
dropped
and
the
king
son
turned
off
toward
the
wood
singing
and
joyous
but
walter
went
soberly
toward
the
house
forsooth
he
was
not
greatly
cast
down
for
besides
that
he
knew
that
the
king
son
was
false
he
deemed
that
under
this
double
tryst
lay
something
which
was
in
his
own
behalf
yet
was
he
eager
and
troubled
if
not
and
his
soul
was
cast
about
betwixt
hope
and
fear
chapter
xx
walter
is
bidden
to
another
tryst
so
came
he
into
the
pillared
hall
and
there
he
found
the
lady
walking
to
and
fro
by
the
and
when
he
drew
nigh
she
turned
on
him
and
said
in
a
voice
rather
eager
than
angry
what
hast
thou
done
squire
why
art
thou
come
before
me
he
was
abashed
and
bowed
before
her
and
said
o
gracious
lady
thou
badest
me
service
and
i
have
been
about
it
she
said
tell
me
then
tell
me
what
hath
betided
lady
said
he
when
i
entered
the
thicket
of
thy
swooning
i
found
there
no
carcase
of
the
lion
nor
any
sign
of
the
dragging
away
of
him
she
looked
full
in
his
face
for
a
little
and
then
went
to
her
chair
and
sat
down
therein
and
in
a
little
while
spake
to
him
in
a
softer
voice
and
said
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
some
enemy
had
done
that
unto
me
and
lo
now
thou
seest
that
so
it
is
then
was
she
silent
again
and
knit
her
brows
and
set
her
teeth
and
thereafter
she
spake
harshly
and
fiercely
but
i
will
overcome
her
and
make
her
days
evil
but
keep
death
away
from
her
that
she
may
die
many
times
over
and
know
all
the
sickness
of
the
heart
when
foes
be
nigh
and
friends
afar
and
there
is
none
to
deliver
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
face
was
dark
with
anger
but
she
turned
and
caught
walter
eyes
and
the
sternness
of
his
face
and
she
softened
at
once
and
said
but
thou
this
hath
little
to
do
with
thee
and
now
to
thee
i
speak
now
cometh
even
and
night
go
thou
to
thy
chamber
and
there
shalt
thou
find
raiment
worthy
of
thee
what
thou
now
art
and
what
thou
shalt
be
do
on
the
same
and
make
thyself
most
goodly
and
then
come
thou
hither
and
eat
and
drink
with
me
and
afterwards
depart
whither
thou
wilt
till
the
night
has
worn
to
its
midmost
and
then
come
thou
to
my
chamber
to
wit
through
the
ivory
door
in
the
gallery
above
and
then
and
there
shall
i
tell
thee
a
thing
and
it
shall
be
for
the
weal
both
of
thee
and
of
me
but
for
the
grief
and
woe
of
the
enemy
therewith
she
reached
her
hand
to
him
and
he
kissed
it
and
departed
and
came
to
his
chamber
and
found
raiment
therebefore
rich
beyond
measure
and
he
wondered
if
any
new
snare
lay
therein
yet
if
there
were
he
saw
no
way
whereby
he
might
escape
it
so
he
did
it
on
and
became
as
the
most
glorious
of
kings
and
yet
lovelier
than
any
king
of
the
world
sithence
he
went
his
way
into
the
pillared
hall
when
it
was
now
night
and
without
the
moon
was
up
and
the
trees
of
the
wood
as
still
as
images
but
within
the
hall
shone
bright
with
many
candles
and
the
fountain
glittered
in
the
light
of
them
as
it
ran
tinkling
sweetly
into
the
little
stream
and
the
silvern
bridges
gleamed
and
the
pillars
shone
all
round
about
and
there
on
the
dais
was
a
table
dight
most
royally
and
the
lady
sitting
thereat
clad
in
her
most
glorious
array
and
behind
her
the
maid
standing
humbly
yet
clad
in
precious
web
of
shimmering
gold
but
with
feet
unshod
and
the
iron
ring
upon
her
ankle
so
walter
came
his
ways
to
the
and
the
lady
rose
and
greeted
him
and
took
him
by
the
hands
and
kissed
him
on
either
cheek
and
sat
him
down
beside
her
so
they
fell
to
their
meat
and
the
maid
served
them
but
the
lady
took
no
more
heed
of
her
than
if
she
were
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
hall
but
walter
she
caressed
oft
with
sweet
words
and
the
touch
of
her
hand
making
him
drink
out
of
her
cup
and
eat
out
of
her
dish
as
to
him
he
was
bashful
by
seeming
but
verily
fearful
he
took
the
lady
caresses
with
what
grace
he
might
and
durst
not
so
much
as
glance
at
her
maid
long
indeed
seemed
that
banquet
to
him
and
longer
yet
endured
the
weariness
of
his
abiding
there
kind
to
his
foe
and
unkind
to
his
friend
for
after
the
banquet
they
still
sat
a
while
and
the
lady
talked
much
to
walter
about
many
things
of
the
ways
of
the
world
and
he
answered
what
he
might
distraught
as
he
was
with
the
thought
of
those
two
trysts
which
he
had
to
deal
with
at
last
spake
the
lady
and
said
now
must
i
leave
thee
for
a
little
and
thou
wottest
where
and
how
we
shall
meet
next
and
meanwhile
disport
thee
as
thou
wilt
so
that
thou
weary
not
thyself
for
i
love
to
see
thee
joyous
then
she
arose
stately
and
grand
but
she
kissed
walter
on
the
mouth
ere
she
turned
to
go
out
of
the
hall
the
maid
followed
her
but
or
ever
she
was
quite
gone
she
stooped
and
made
that
sign
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
walter
as
if
in
entreaty
to
him
and
there
was
fear
and
anguish
in
her
face
but
he
nodded
his
head
to
her
in
of
the
tryst
in
the
and
in
a
trice
she
was
gone
walter
went
down
the
hall
and
forth
into
the
early
night
but
in
the
jaws
of
the
porch
he
came
up
against
the
king
son
who
gazing
at
his
attire
glittering
with
all
its
gems
in
the
moonlight
laughed
out
and
said
now
may
it
be
seen
how
thou
art
risen
in
degree
above
me
whereas
i
am
but
a
king
son
and
that
a
king
of
a
far
country
whereas
thou
art
a
king
of
kings
or
shalt
be
this
night
yea
and
of
this
very
country
wherein
we
both
are
now
walter
saw
the
mock
which
lay
under
his
words
but
he
kept
back
his
wrath
and
answered
fair
sir
art
thou
as
well
contented
with
thy
lot
as
when
the
sun
went
down
hast
thou
no
doubt
or
fear
will
the
maid
verily
keep
tryst
with
thee
or
hath
she
given
thee
but
to
escape
thee
this
time
or
again
may
she
not
turn
to
the
lady
and
appeal
to
her
against
thee
now
when
he
had
spoken
these
words
he
repented
thereof
and
feared
for
himself
and
the
maid
lest
he
had
stirred
some
misgiving
in
that
young
man
foolish
heart
but
the
king
son
did
but
laugh
and
answered
nought
but
to
walter
last
words
and
said
yea
yea
this
word
of
thine
showeth
how
little
thou
wottest
of
that
which
lieth
betwixt
my
darling
and
thine
doth
the
lamb
appeal
from
the
shepherd
to
the
wolf
even
so
shall
the
maid
appeal
from
me
to
thy
lady
what
ask
thy
lady
at
thy
leisure
what
her
wont
hath
been
with
her
thrall
she
shall
think
it
a
fair
tale
to
tell
thee
thereof
but
thereof
is
my
maid
all
whole
now
by
reason
of
her
wisdom
in
leechcraft
or
somewhat
more
and
now
i
tell
thee
again
that
the
beforesaid
maid
must
needs
do
my
will
for
if
i
be
the
deep
sea
and
i
deem
not
so
ill
of
myself
that
other
one
is
the
devil
as
belike
thou
shalt
find
out
for
thyself
later
on
yea
all
is
well
with
me
and
more
than
well
and
therewith
he
swung
merrily
into
the
litten
hall
but
walter
went
out
into
the
moonlit
night
and
wandered
about
for
an
hour
or
more
and
stole
warily
into
the
hall
and
thence
into
his
own
chamber
there
he
did
off
that
royal
array
and
did
his
own
raiment
upon
him
he
girt
him
with
sword
and
knife
took
his
bow
and
quiver
and
stole
down
and
out
again
even
as
he
had
come
in
then
he
fetched
a
compass
and
came
down
into
the
from
the
north
and
lay
hidden
there
while
the
night
wore
till
he
deemed
it
would
lack
but
little
of
midnight
chapter
xxi
walter
and
the
maid
flee
from
the
golden
house
there
he
abode
amidst
the
hazels
hearkening
every
littlest
sound
and
the
sounds
were
nought
but
the
night
voices
of
the
wood
till
suddenly
there
burst
forth
from
the
house
a
great
wailing
cry
walter
heart
came
up
into
his
mouth
but
he
had
no
time
to
do
aught
for
following
hard
on
the
cry
came
the
sound
of
light
feet
close
to
him
the
boughs
were
thrust
aside
and
there
was
come
the
maid
and
she
but
in
her
white
coat
and
barefoot
and
then
first
he
felt
the
sweetness
of
her
flesh
on
his
for
she
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
said
breathlessly
now
now
there
may
yet
be
time
or
even
too
much
it
may
be
for
the
saving
of
breath
ask
me
no
questions
but
come
he
dallied
not
but
went
as
she
led
and
they
were
lightfoot
both
of
them
they
went
the
same
way
due
south
to
wit
whereby
he
had
gone
with
the
lady
and
whiles
they
ran
and
whiles
they
walked
but
so
fast
they
went
that
by
grey
of
the
dawn
they
were
come
as
far
as
that
coppice
or
thicket
of
the
lion
and
still
they
hastened
onward
and
but
little
had
the
maid
spoken
save
here
and
there
a
word
to
hearten
up
walter
and
here
and
there
a
shy
word
of
endearment
at
last
the
dawn
grew
into
early
day
and
as
they
came
over
the
brow
of
a
bent
they
looked
down
over
a
plain
land
whereas
the
trees
grew
and
beyond
the
plain
rose
up
the
land
into
long
green
hills
and
over
those
again
were
blue
mountains
great
and
far
away
then
spake
the
maid
over
yonder
lie
the
outlying
mountains
of
the
bears
and
through
them
we
needs
must
pass
to
our
great
peril
nay
friend
she
said
as
he
handled
his
it
must
be
patience
and
wisdom
to
bring
us
through
and
not
the
fallow
blade
of
one
man
though
he
be
a
good
one
but
look
below
there
runs
a
stream
through
the
first
of
the
plain
and
i
see
nought
for
it
but
we
must
now
rest
our
bodies
moreover
i
have
a
tale
to
tell
thee
which
is
burning
my
heart
for
maybe
there
will
be
a
pardon
to
ask
of
thee
moreover
wherefore
i
fear
thee
quoth
walter
how
may
that
be
she
answered
him
not
but
took
his
hand
and
led
him
down
the
bent
but
he
said
thou
sayest
rest
but
are
we
now
out
of
all
peril
of
the
chase
she
said
i
can
not
tell
till
i
know
what
hath
befallen
her
if
she
be
not
to
hand
to
set
on
her
trackers
they
will
scarce
happen
on
us
now
if
it
be
not
for
that
one
and
she
shuddered
and
he
felt
her
hand
change
as
he
held
it
then
she
said
but
peril
or
no
peril
needs
must
we
rest
for
i
tell
thee
again
what
i
have
to
say
to
thee
burneth
my
bosom
for
fear
of
thee
so
that
i
can
go
no
further
until
i
have
told
thee
then
he
said
i
wot
not
of
this
queen
and
her
mightiness
and
her
servants
i
will
ask
thereof
later
but
besides
the
others
is
there
not
the
king
son
he
who
loves
thee
so
unworthily
she
paled
somewhat
and
said
as
for
him
there
had
been
nought
for
thee
to
fear
in
him
save
his
treason
but
now
shall
he
neither
love
nor
hate
any
more
he
died
last
midnight
yea
and
how
said
walter
nay
she
said
let
me
tell
my
tale
all
together
once
for
all
lest
thou
blame
me
overmuch
but
first
we
will
wash
us
and
comfort
us
as
best
we
may
and
then
amidst
our
resting
shall
the
word
be
said
by
then
were
they
come
down
to
the
which
ran
fair
in
pools
and
stickles
amidst
rocks
and
sandy
banks
she
said
there
behind
the
great
grey
rock
is
my
bath
friend
and
here
is
thine
and
lo
the
uprising
of
the
sun
so
she
went
her
ways
to
the
said
rock
and
he
bathed
him
and
washed
the
night
off
him
and
by
then
he
was
clad
again
she
came
back
fresh
and
sweet
from
the
water
and
with
her
lap
full
of
cherries
from
a
wilding
which
overhung
her
bath
so
they
sat
down
together
on
the
green
grass
above
the
sand
and
ate
the
breakfast
of
the
wilderness
and
walter
was
full
of
content
as
he
watched
her
and
beheld
her
sweetness
and
her
loveliness
yet
were
they
either
of
them
somewhat
shy
and
shamefaced
each
with
the
other
so
that
he
did
but
kiss
her
hands
once
and
again
and
though
she
shrank
not
from
him
yet
had
she
no
boldness
to
cast
herself
into
his
arms
chapter
xxii
of
the
dwarf
and
the
pardon
now
she
began
to
say
my
friend
now
shall
i
tell
thee
what
i
have
done
for
thee
and
me
and
if
thou
have
a
mind
to
blame
me
and
punish
me
yet
remember
first
that
what
i
have
done
has
been
for
thee
and
our
hope
of
happy
life
well
i
shall
tell
thee
but
therewithal
her
speech
failed
her
and
springing
up
she
faced
the
bent
and
pointed
with
her
finger
and
she
all
deadly
pale
and
shaking
so
that
she
might
scarce
stand
and
might
speak
no
word
though
a
feeble
gibbering
came
from
her
mouth
walter
leapt
up
and
put
his
arm
about
her
and
looked
whitherward
she
pointed
and
at
first
saw
nought
and
then
nought
but
a
brown
and
yellow
rock
rolling
down
the
bent
and
then
at
last
he
saw
that
it
was
the
evil
thing
which
had
met
him
when
first
he
came
into
that
land
and
now
it
stood
upright
and
he
could
see
that
it
was
clad
in
a
coat
of
yellow
samite
then
walter
stooped
down
and
gat
his
bow
into
his
hand
and
stood
before
the
maid
while
he
nocked
an
arrow
but
the
monster
made
ready
his
tackle
while
walter
was
stooping
down
and
or
ever
he
could
loose
his
twanged
and
an
arrow
flew
forth
and
grazed
the
maid
arm
above
the
elbow
so
that
the
blood
ran
and
the
dwarf
gave
forth
a
harsh
and
horrible
cry
then
flew
walter
shaft
and
true
was
it
aimed
so
that
it
smote
the
monster
full
on
the
breast
but
fell
down
from
him
as
if
he
were
made
of
stone
then
the
creature
set
up
his
horrible
cry
again
and
loosed
withal
and
walter
deemed
that
he
had
smitten
the
maid
for
she
fell
down
in
a
heap
behind
him
then
waxed
walter
and
cast
down
his
bow
and
drew
his
sword
and
strode
forward
towards
the
bent
against
the
dwarf
but
he
roared
out
again
and
there
were
words
in
his
roar
and
he
said
fool
thou
shalt
go
free
if
thou
wilt
give
up
the
enemy
and
who
said
walter
is
the
enemy
yelled
the
dwarf
she
the
pink
and
white
thing
lying
there
she
is
not
dead
yet
she
is
but
dying
for
fear
of
me
yea
she
hath
reason
i
could
have
set
the
shaft
in
her
heart
as
easily
as
scratching
her
arm
but
i
need
her
body
alive
that
i
may
wreak
me
on
her
what
wilt
thou
do
with
her
said
walter
for
now
he
had
heard
that
the
maid
was
not
slain
he
had
waxed
wary
again
and
stood
watching
his
chance
the
dwarf
yelled
so
at
his
last
word
that
no
word
came
from
the
noise
a
while
and
then
he
said
what
will
i
with
her
let
me
at
her
and
stand
by
and
look
on
and
then
shalt
thou
have
a
strange
tale
to
carry
off
with
thee
for
i
will
let
thee
go
this
while
said
walter
but
what
need
to
wreak
thee
what
hath
she
done
to
thee
what
need
what
need
roared
the
dwarf
have
i
not
told
thee
that
she
is
the
enemy
and
thou
askest
of
what
she
hath
done
of
what
fool
she
is
the
murderer
she
hath
slain
the
lady
that
was
our
lady
and
that
made
us
she
whom
all
we
worshipped
and
adored
o
impudent
fool
therewith
he
nocked
and
loosed
another
arrow
which
would
have
smitten
walter
in
the
face
but
that
he
lowered
his
head
in
the
very
nick
of
time
then
with
a
great
shout
he
rushed
up
the
bent
and
was
on
the
dwarf
before
he
could
get
his
sword
out
and
leaping
aloft
dealt
the
creature
a
stroke
amidmost
of
the
crown
and
so
mightily
be
smote
that
he
drave
the
heavy
sword
right
through
to
the
teeth
so
that
he
fell
dead
straightway
walter
stood
over
him
a
minute
and
when
be
saw
that
he
moved
not
he
went
slowly
down
to
the
stream
whereby
the
maid
yet
lay
cowering
down
and
quivering
all
over
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
then
he
took
her
by
the
wrist
and
said
up
maiden
up
and
tell
me
this
tale
of
the
slaying
but
she
shrunk
away
from
him
and
looked
at
him
with
wild
eyes
and
said
what
hast
thou
done
with
him
is
he
gone
he
is
dead
said
walter
i
have
slain
him
there
lies
he
with
cloven
skull
on
the
unless
forsooth
he
vanish
away
like
the
lion
i
slew
or
else
perchance
he
will
come
to
life
again
and
art
thou
a
lie
like
to
the
rest
of
them
let
me
hear
of
this
slaying
she
rose
up
and
stood
before
him
trembling
and
said
o
thou
art
angry
with
me
and
thine
anger
i
can
not
bear
ah
what
have
i
done
thou
hast
slain
one
and
i
maybe
the
other
and
never
had
we
escaped
till
both
these
twain
were
dead
ah
thou
dost
not
know
thou
dost
not
know
o
me
what
shall
i
do
to
appease
thy
wrath
he
looked
on
her
and
his
heart
rose
to
his
mouth
at
the
thought
of
sundering
from
her
still
he
looked
on
her
and
her
piteous
friendly
face
melted
all
his
heart
he
threw
down
his
sword
and
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
kissed
her
face
over
and
over
and
strained
her
to
him
so
that
he
felt
the
sweetness
of
her
bosom
then
he
lifted
her
up
like
a
child
and
set
her
down
on
the
green
grass
and
went
down
to
the
water
and
filled
his
hat
therefrom
and
came
back
to
her
then
he
gave
her
to
drink
and
bathed
her
face
and
her
hands
so
that
the
colour
came
aback
to
the
cheeks
and
lips
of
her
and
she
smiled
on
him
and
kissed
his
hands
and
said
o
now
thou
art
kind
to
me
yea
said
he
and
true
it
is
that
if
thou
hast
slain
i
have
done
no
less
and
if
thou
hast
lied
even
so
have
i
and
if
thou
hast
played
the
wanton
as
i
deem
not
that
thou
hast
i
full
surely
have
so
done
so
now
thou
shalt
pardon
me
and
when
thy
spirit
has
come
back
to
thee
thou
shalt
tell
me
thy
tale
in
all
friendship
and
in
all
will
i
hearken
the
same
therewith
he
knelt
before
her
and
kissed
her
feet
but
she
said
yea
yea
what
thou
willest
that
will
i
do
but
first
tell
me
one
thing
hast
thou
buried
this
horror
and
hidden
him
in
the
earth
he
deemed
that
fear
had
bewildered
her
and
that
she
scarcely
yet
knew
how
things
had
gone
but
he
said
fair
sweet
friend
i
have
not
done
it
as
yet
but
now
will
i
go
and
do
it
if
it
seem
good
to
thee
yea
she
said
but
first
must
thou
smite
off
his
head
and
lie
it
by
his
buttocks
when
he
is
in
the
earth
or
evil
things
will
happen
else
this
of
the
burying
is
no
idle
matter
i
bid
thee
believe
i
doubt
it
not
said
he
surely
such
malice
as
was
in
this
one
will
be
hard
to
slay
and
he
picked
up
his
sword
and
turned
to
go
to
the
field
of
deed
she
said
i
must
needs
go
with
thee
terror
hath
so
filled
my
soul
that
i
durst
not
abide
here
without
thee
so
they
went
both
together
to
where
the
creature
lay
the
maid
durst
not
look
on
the
dead
monster
but
walter
noted
that
he
was
girt
with
a
big
ungainly
sax
so
he
drew
it
from
the
sheath
and
there
smote
off
the
hideous
head
of
the
fiend
with
his
own
weapon
then
they
twain
together
laboured
the
earth
she
with
walter
sword
he
with
the
ugly
sax
till
they
had
made
a
grave
deep
and
wide
enough
and
therein
they
thrust
the
creature
and
covered
him
up
weapons
and
all
together
chapter
xxiii
of
the
peaceful
ending
of
that
wild
day
thereafter
walter
led
the
maid
down
again
and
said
to
her
now
sweetling
shall
the
story
be
told
nay
friend
she
said
not
here
this
place
hath
been
polluted
by
my
craven
fear
and
the
horror
of
the
vile
wretch
of
whom
no
words
may
tell
his
vileness
let
us
hence
and
onward
thou
seest
i
have
once
more
come
to
life
again
but
said
he
thou
hast
been
hurt
by
the
dwarf
arrow
she
laughed
and
said
had
i
never
had
greater
hurt
from
them
than
that
little
had
been
the
tale
thereof
yet
whereas
thou
lookest
dolorous
about
it
we
will
speedily
heal
it
therewith
she
sought
about
and
found
nigh
the
certain
herbs
and
she
spake
words
over
them
and
bade
walter
lay
them
on
the
wound
which
forsooth
was
of
the
least
and
he
did
so
and
bound
a
strip
of
his
shirt
about
her
arm
and
then
would
she
set
forth
but
he
said
thou
art
all
unshod
and
but
if
that
be
seen
to
our
journey
shall
be
stayed
by
thy
i
may
make
a
shift
to
fashion
thee
brogues
she
said
i
may
well
go
barefoot
and
in
any
case
i
entreat
thee
that
we
tarry
here
no
longer
but
go
away
hence
if
it
be
but
for
a
mile
and
she
looked
piteously
on
him
so
that
he
might
not
gainsay
her
so
then
they
crossed
the
stream
and
set
forward
when
amidst
all
these
haps
the
day
was
worn
to
midmorning
but
after
they
had
gone
a
mile
they
sat
them
down
on
a
knoll
under
the
shadow
of
a
big
within
sight
of
the
mountains
then
said
walter
now
will
i
cut
thee
the
brogues
from
the
skirt
of
my
which
shall
be
well
meet
for
such
work
and
meanwhile
shalt
thou
tell
me
thy
tale
thou
art
kind
she
said
but
be
kinder
yet
and
abide
my
tale
till
we
have
done
our
day
work
for
we
were
best
to
make
no
long
delay
here
because
though
thou
hast
slain
the
yet
there
be
others
of
his
kindred
who
swarm
in
some
parts
of
the
wood
as
the
rabbits
in
a
warren
now
true
it
is
that
they
have
but
little
understanding
less
it
may
be
than
the
very
brute
beasts
and
that
as
i
said
afore
unless
they
be
set
on
our
slot
like
to
hounds
they
shall
have
no
inkling
of
where
to
seek
us
yet
might
they
happen
upon
us
by
mere
misadventure
and
moreover
friend
quoth
she
blushing
i
would
beg
of
thee
some
little
respite
for
though
i
scarce
fear
thy
wrath
any
more
since
thou
hast
been
so
kind
to
me
yet
is
there
shame
in
that
which
i
have
to
tell
thee
wherefore
since
the
fairest
of
the
day
is
before
us
let
us
use
it
all
we
may
and
when
thou
hast
done
me
my
new
get
us
gone
forward
again
he
kissed
her
kindly
and
her
asking
he
had
already
fallen
to
work
on
the
leather
and
in
a
while
had
fashioned
her
the
brogues
so
she
tied
them
to
her
feet
and
arose
with
a
smile
and
said
now
am
i
hale
and
strong
again
what
with
the
rest
and
what
with
thy
and
thou
shalt
see
how
nimble
i
shall
be
to
leave
this
land
for
as
fair
as
it
is
since
forsooth
a
land
of
lies
it
is
and
of
grief
to
the
children
of
adam
so
they
went
their
ways
thence
and
fared
nimbly
indeed
and
made
no
stay
till
some
three
hours
after
noon
when
they
rested
by
a
where
the
strawberries
grew
plenty
they
ate
thereof
what
they
would
and
from
a
great
oak
hard
by
walter
shot
him
first
one
culver
and
then
another
and
hung
them
to
his
girdle
to
be
for
their
evening
meal
sithence
they
went
forward
again
and
nought
befell
them
to
tell
of
till
they
were
come
whenas
it
lacked
scarce
an
hour
of
sunset
to
the
banks
of
another
river
not
right
great
but
bigger
than
the
last
one
there
the
maid
cast
herself
down
and
said
friend
no
further
will
thy
friend
go
this
even
nay
to
say
sooth
she
can
not
so
now
we
will
eat
of
thy
venison
and
then
shall
my
tale
be
since
i
may
no
longer
delay
it
and
thereafter
shall
our
slumber
be
sweet
and
safe
as
i
deem
she
spake
merrily
now
and
as
one
who
feared
nothing
and
walter
was
much
heartened
by
her
words
and
her
voice
and
he
fell
to
and
made
a
fire
and
a
woodland
oven
in
the
earth
and
sithence
dighted
his
fowl
and
baked
them
after
the
manner
of
and
they
ate
both
of
them
in
all
love
and
in
of
life
and
were
much
strengthened
by
their
supper
and
when
they
were
done
walter
eked
his
fire
both
against
the
chill
of
the
midnight
and
dawning
and
for
a
guard
against
wild
beasts
and
by
that
time
night
was
come
and
the
moon
arisen
then
the
maiden
drew
up
to
the
fire
and
turned
to
walter
and
spake
chapter
xxiv
the
maid
tells
of
what
had
befallen
her
now
friend
by
the
clear
of
the
moon
and
this
firelight
will
i
tell
what
i
may
and
can
of
my
tale
thus
it
is
if
i
be
wholly
of
the
race
of
adam
i
wot
not
nor
can
i
tell
thee
how
many
years
old
i
may
be
for
there
are
as
it
were
shards
or
gaps
in
my
life
wherein
are
but
a
few
things
dimly
remembered
and
doubtless
many
things
forgotten
i
remember
well
when
i
was
a
little
child
and
right
happy
and
there
were
people
about
me
whom
i
loved
and
who
loved
me
it
was
not
in
this
land
but
all
things
were
lovely
there
the
year
beginning
the
happy
the
year
waning
the
year
ending
and
then
again
its
beginning
that
passed
away
and
then
for
a
while
is
more
than
dimness
for
nought
i
remember
save
that
i
was
thereafter
i
remember
again
and
am
a
young
maiden
and
i
know
some
things
and
long
to
know
more
i
am
nowise
happy
i
am
amongst
people
who
bid
me
go
and
i
go
and
do
this
and
i
do
it
none
loveth
me
none
tormenteth
me
but
i
wear
my
heart
in
longing
for
i
scarce
know
what
neither
then
am
i
in
this
land
but
in
a
land
that
i
love
not
and
a
house
that
is
big
and
stately
but
nought
lovely
then
is
a
dim
time
again
and
sithence
a
time
not
right
clear
an
evil
time
wherein
i
am
older
wellnigh
grown
to
womanhood
there
are
a
many
folk
about
me
and
they
foul
and
greedy
and
hard
and
my
spirit
is
fierce
and
my
body
feeble
and
i
am
set
to
tasks
that
i
would
not
do
by
them
that
are
unwiser
than
i
and
smitten
i
am
by
them
that
are
less
valiant
than
i
and
i
know
lack
and
stripes
and
divers
misery
but
all
that
is
now
become
but
a
dim
picture
to
me
save
that
amongst
all
these
unfriends
is
a
friend
to
me
an
old
woman
who
telleth
me
sweet
tales
of
other
life
wherein
all
is
high
and
goodly
or
at
the
least
valiant
and
doughty
and
she
setteth
hope
in
my
heart
and
learneth
me
and
maketh
me
to
know
much
o
much
so
that
at
last
i
am
grown
wise
and
wise
to
be
mighty
if
i
durst
yet
am
i
nought
in
this
land
all
this
while
but
as
meseemeth
in
a
great
and
a
foul
city
and
then
as
it
were
i
fall
asleep
and
in
my
sleep
is
nought
save
here
and
there
a
wild
dream
somedeal
lovely
somedeal
hideous
but
of
this
dream
is
my
mistress
a
part
and
the
monster
withal
whose
head
thou
didst
cleave
but
when
i
am
awaken
from
it
then
am
i
verily
in
this
land
and
myself
as
thou
seest
me
and
the
first
part
of
my
life
here
is
this
that
i
am
in
the
pillared
ball
yonder
and
with
bound
hands
and
the
dwarf
leadeth
me
to
the
lady
and
i
hear
his
horrible
croak
as
he
sayeth
will
this
one
do
and
then
the
sweet
voice
of
the
lady
saying
one
will
do
thou
shalt
have
thy
reward
now
set
thou
the
token
upon
her
then
i
remember
the
dwarf
dragging
me
away
and
my
heart
sinking
for
fear
of
him
but
for
that
time
he
did
me
no
more
harm
than
the
rivetting
upon
my
leg
this
iron
ring
which
here
thou
seest
so
from
that
time
forward
i
have
lived
in
this
land
and
been
the
thrall
of
the
lady
and
i
remember
my
life
here
day
by
day
and
no
part
of
it
has
fallen
into
the
dimness
of
dreams
thereof
will
i
tell
thee
but
little
but
this
i
will
tell
thee
that
in
spite
of
my
past
dreams
or
it
may
be
because
of
them
i
had
not
lost
the
wisdom
which
the
old
woman
had
erst
learned
me
and
for
more
wisdom
i
longed
maybe
this
longing
shall
now
make
both
thee
and
me
happy
but
for
the
passing
time
it
brought
me
grief
for
at
first
my
mistress
was
indeed
wayward
with
me
but
as
any
great
lady
might
be
with
her
bought
thrall
whiles
caressing
me
and
whiles
chastising
me
as
her
mood
went
but
she
seemed
not
to
be
cruel
of
malice
or
with
any
set
purpose
but
so
it
was
rather
little
by
little
than
by
any
great
sudden
uncovering
of
my
intent
that
she
came
to
know
that
i
also
had
some
of
the
wisdom
whereby
she
lived
her
queenly
life
that
was
about
two
years
after
i
was
first
her
thrall
and
three
weary
years
have
gone
by
since
she
began
to
see
in
me
the
enemy
of
her
days
now
why
or
wherefore
i
know
not
but
it
seemeth
that
it
would
not
avail
her
to
slay
me
outright
or
suffer
me
to
die
but
nought
withheld
her
from
piling
up
griefs
and
miseries
on
my
head
at
last
she
set
her
servant
the
dwarf
upon
me
even
he
whose
head
thou
clavest
many
things
i
bore
from
him
whereof
it
were
unseemly
for
my
tongue
to
tell
before
thee
but
the
time
came
when
he
exceeded
and
i
could
bear
no
more
and
then
i
showed
him
this
sharp
knife
wherewith
i
would
have
thrust
me
through
to
the
heart
if
thou
hadst
not
pardoned
me
now
and
i
told
him
that
if
he
forbore
me
not
i
would
slay
not
him
but
myself
and
this
he
might
not
away
with
because
of
the
commandment
of
the
lady
who
had
given
him
the
word
that
in
any
case
i
must
be
kept
living
and
her
hand
withal
fear
held
somewhat
hereafter
yet
was
there
need
to
me
of
all
my
wisdom
for
with
all
this
her
hatred
grew
and
whiles
raged
within
her
so
furiously
that
it
overmastered
her
fear
and
at
such
times
she
would
have
put
me
to
death
if
i
had
not
escaped
her
by
some
turn
of
my
lore
now
further
i
shall
tell
thee
that
somewhat
more
than
a
year
ago
hither
to
this
land
came
the
king
son
the
second
goodly
man
as
thou
art
the
third
whom
her
sorceries
have
drawn
hither
since
i
have
dwelt
here
forsooth
when
he
first
came
he
seemed
to
us
to
me
and
yet
more
to
my
lady
to
be
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
and
sorely
she
loved
him
and
he
her
after
his
fashion
but
he
was
and
and
in
a
while
he
must
needs
turn
his
eyes
upon
me
and
offer
me
his
love
which
was
but
foul
and
unkind
as
it
turned
out
for
when
i
him
as
maybe
i
had
not
done
save
for
fear
of
my
mistress
he
had
no
pity
upon
me
but
spared
not
to
lead
me
into
the
trap
of
her
wrath
and
leave
me
without
help
or
a
good
word
but
o
friend
in
spite
of
all
grief
and
anguish
i
learned
still
and
waxed
wise
and
wiser
abiding
the
day
of
my
deliverance
which
has
come
and
thou
art
come
therewith
she
took
walter
hands
and
kissed
them
but
he
kissed
her
face
and
her
tears
wet
her
lips
then
she
went
on
but
sithence
months
ago
the
lady
began
to
weary
of
this
dastard
despite
of
his
beauty
and
then
it
was
thy
turn
to
be
swept
into
her
net
i
partly
guess
how
for
on
a
day
in
broad
daylight
as
i
was
serving
my
mistress
in
the
hall
and
the
evil
thing
whose
head
is
now
cloven
was
lying
across
the
threshold
of
the
door
as
it
were
a
dream
fell
upon
me
though
i
strove
to
cast
it
off
for
fear
of
chastisement
for
the
pillared
hall
wavered
and
vanished
from
my
sight
and
my
feet
were
treading
a
rough
stone
pavement
instead
of
the
marble
wonder
of
the
hall
and
there
was
the
scent
of
the
salt
sea
and
of
the
tackle
of
ships
and
behind
me
were
tall
houses
and
before
me
the
ships
indeed
with
their
ropes
beating
and
their
sails
flapping
and
their
masts
wavering
and
in
mine
ears
was
the
hale
and
how
of
mariners
things
that
i
had
seen
and
heard
in
the
dimness
of
my
life
gone
by
and
there
was
i
and
the
dwarf
before
me
and
the
lady
after
me
going
over
the
gangway
aboard
of
a
tall
ship
and
she
gathered
way
and
was
gotten
out
of
the
haven
and
straightway
i
saw
the
mariners
cast
abroad
their
ancient
quoth
walter
what
then
sawest
thou
the
blazon
thereon
of
a
beast
ramping
up
against
a
maiden
and
that
might
well
have
been
thou
she
said
yea
so
it
was
but
refrain
thee
that
i
may
tell
on
my
tale
the
ship
and
the
sea
vanished
away
but
i
was
not
back
in
the
hall
of
the
golden
house
and
again
were
we
three
in
the
street
of
the
town
which
we
had
but
just
left
but
somewhat
dim
was
my
vision
thereof
and
i
saw
little
save
the
door
of
a
goodly
house
before
me
and
speedily
it
died
out
and
we
were
again
in
the
pillared
hall
wherein
my
thralldom
was
made
manifest
maiden
said
walter
one
question
i
would
ask
thee
to
wit
didst
thou
see
me
on
the
quay
by
the
ships
nay
she
said
there
were
many
folk
about
but
they
were
all
as
images
of
the
aliens
to
me
now
hearken
further
three
months
thereafter
came
the
dream
upon
me
again
when
we
were
all
three
together
in
the
pillared
hall
and
again
was
the
vision
somewhat
dim
once
more
we
were
in
the
street
of
a
busy
town
but
all
unlike
to
that
other
one
and
there
were
men
standing
together
on
our
right
hands
by
the
door
of
a
house
yea
yea
quoth
walter
and
forsooth
one
of
them
was
who
but
i
refrain
thee
beloved
she
said
for
my
tale
draweth
to
its
ending
and
i
would
have
thee
hearken
heedfully
for
maybe
thou
shalt
once
again
deem
my
deed
past
pardon
some
twenty
days
after
this
last
dream
i
had
some
leisure
from
my
mistress
service
so
i
went
to
disport
me
by
the
well
of
the
or
forsooth
she
might
have
set
in
my
mind
the
thought
of
going
there
that
i
might
meet
thee
and
give
her
some
occasion
against
me
and
i
sat
thereby
nowise
loving
the
earth
but
sick
at
heart
because
of
late
the
king
son
had
been
more
than
ever
instant
with
me
to
yield
him
my
body
threatening
me
else
with
casting
me
into
all
that
the
worst
could
do
to
me
of
torments
and
shames
day
by
day
i
say
my
heart
failed
me
and
i
was
wellnigh
brought
to
the
point
of
saying
his
desires
that
i
might
take
the
chance
of
something
befalling
me
that
were
less
bad
than
the
worst
but
here
must
i
tell
thee
a
thing
and
pray
thee
to
take
it
to
heart
this
more
than
aught
else
had
given
me
strength
to
that
dastard
that
my
wisdom
both
hath
been
and
now
is
the
wisdom
of
a
wise
maid
and
not
of
a
woman
and
all
the
might
thereof
shall
i
lose
with
my
maidenhead
evil
wilt
thou
think
of
me
then
for
all
i
was
tried
so
sore
that
i
was
at
point
to
cast
it
all
away
so
wretchedly
as
i
shrank
from
the
horror
of
the
lady
wrath
but
there
as
i
sat
pondering
these
things
i
saw
a
man
coming
and
thought
no
otherwise
thereof
but
that
it
was
the
king
son
till
i
saw
the
stranger
drawing
near
and
his
golden
hair
and
his
grey
eyes
and
then
i
heard
his
voice
and
his
kindness
pierced
my
heart
and
i
knew
that
my
friend
had
come
to
see
me
and
o
friend
these
tears
are
for
the
sweetness
of
that
past
hour
said
walter
i
came
to
see
my
friend
i
also
now
have
i
noted
what
thou
badest
me
and
i
will
forbear
all
as
thou
commandest
me
till
we
be
safe
out
of
the
desert
and
far
away
from
all
evil
things
but
wilt
thou
ban
me
from
all
caresses
she
laughed
amidst
of
her
tears
and
said
o
nay
poor
lad
if
thou
wilt
be
but
wise
then
she
leaned
toward
him
and
took
his
face
betwixt
her
hands
and
kissed
him
oft
and
the
tears
started
in
his
eyes
for
love
and
pity
of
her
then
she
said
alas
friend
even
yet
mayst
thou
doom
me
guilty
and
all
thy
love
may
turn
away
from
me
when
i
have
told
thee
all
that
i
have
done
for
the
sake
of
thee
and
me
o
if
then
there
might
be
some
chastisement
for
the
guilty
woman
and
not
mere
sundering
fear
nothing
sweetling
said
he
for
indeed
i
deem
that
already
i
know
partly
what
thou
hast
done
she
sighed
and
said
i
will
tell
thee
next
that
i
banned
thy
kissing
and
caressing
of
me
till
because
i
knew
that
my
mistress
would
surely
know
if
a
man
if
thou
hadst
so
much
as
touched
a
finger
of
mine
in
love
it
was
to
try
me
herein
that
on
the
morning
of
the
hunting
she
kissed
and
embraced
me
till
i
almost
died
thereof
and
showed
thee
my
shoulder
and
my
limbs
and
to
try
thee
withal
if
thine
eye
should
glister
or
thy
cheek
flush
thereat
for
indeed
she
was
raging
in
jealousy
of
thee
next
my
friend
even
whiles
we
were
talking
together
at
the
well
of
the
rock
i
was
pondering
on
what
we
should
do
to
escape
from
this
land
of
lies
maybe
thou
wilt
say
why
didst
thou
not
take
my
hand
and
flee
with
me
as
we
fled
friend
it
is
most
true
that
were
she
not
dead
we
had
not
escaped
thus
far
for
her
trackers
would
have
followed
us
set
on
by
her
and
brought
us
back
to
an
evil
fate
therefore
i
tell
thee
that
from
the
first
i
did
plot
the
death
of
those
two
the
dwarf
and
the
mistress
for
no
otherwise
mightest
thou
live
or
i
escape
from
death
in
life
but
as
to
the
dastard
who
threatened
me
with
a
thrall
pains
i
heeded
him
nought
to
live
or
die
for
well
i
knew
that
thy
valiant
sword
yea
or
thy
bare
hands
would
speedily
tame
him
now
first
i
knew
that
i
must
make
a
show
of
yielding
to
the
son
and
somewhat
how
i
did
therein
thou
knowest
but
no
night
and
no
time
did
i
give
him
to
bed
me
till
after
i
had
met
thee
as
thou
wentest
to
the
golden
house
before
the
adventure
of
fetching
the
lion
skin
and
up
to
that
time
i
had
scarce
known
what
to
do
save
ever
to
bid
thee
with
sore
grief
and
pain
to
yield
thee
to
the
wicked
woman
desire
but
as
we
spake
together
there
by
the
stream
and
i
saw
that
the
evil
thing
whose
head
thou
clavest
now
was
spying
on
us
then
amidst
the
sickness
of
terror
which
ever
came
over
me
whensoever
i
thought
of
him
and
much
more
when
i
saw
him
ah
he
is
dead
now
it
came
flashing
into
my
mind
how
i
might
destroy
my
enemy
therefore
i
made
the
dwarf
my
messenger
to
her
by
bidding
thee
to
my
bed
in
such
wise
that
he
might
hear
it
and
wot
thou
well
that
he
speedily
carried
her
the
tidings
meanwhile
i
hastened
to
lie
to
the
king
son
and
all
privily
bade
him
come
to
me
and
not
thee
and
thereafter
by
dint
of
waiting
and
watching
and
taking
the
only
chance
that
there
was
i
met
thee
as
thou
camest
back
from
fetching
the
skin
of
the
lion
that
never
was
and
gave
thee
that
warning
or
else
had
we
been
undone
indeed
said
walter
was
the
lion
of
her
making
or
of
thine
then
she
said
of
hers
why
should
i
deal
with
such
a
matter
yea
said
walter
but
she
verily
swooned
and
she
was
verily
wroth
with
the
enemy
the
maid
smiled
and
said
if
her
lie
was
not
like
very
sooth
then
had
she
not
been
the
that
i
knew
her
one
may
lie
otherwise
than
with
the
tongue
alone
yet
indeed
her
wrath
against
the
enemy
was
nought
feigned
for
the
enemy
was
even
i
and
in
these
latter
days
never
did
her
wrath
leave
me
but
to
go
on
with
my
tale
now
doubt
thou
not
that
when
thou
camest
into
the
hall
yester
eve
the
mistress
knew
of
thy
counterfeit
tryst
with
me
and
meant
nought
but
death
for
thee
yet
first
would
she
have
thee
in
her
arms
again
therefore
did
she
make
much
of
thee
at
table
and
that
was
partly
for
my
torment
also
and
therefore
did
she
make
that
tryst
with
thee
and
deemed
doubtless
that
thou
wouldst
not
dare
to
forgo
it
even
if
thou
shouldst
go
to
me
thereafter
now
i
had
trained
that
dastard
to
me
as
i
have
told
thee
but
i
gave
him
a
sleepy
draught
so
that
when
i
came
to
the
bed
he
might
not
move
toward
me
nor
open
his
eyes
but
i
lay
down
beside
him
so
that
the
lady
might
know
that
my
body
had
been
there
for
well
had
she
wotted
if
it
had
not
then
as
there
i
lay
i
cast
over
him
thy
shape
so
that
none
might
have
known
but
that
thou
wert
lying
by
my
side
and
there
trembling
i
abode
what
should
befall
thus
i
passed
through
the
hour
whenas
thou
shouldest
have
been
at
her
chamber
and
the
time
of
my
tryst
with
thee
was
come
as
the
mistress
would
be
deeming
so
that
i
looked
for
her
speedily
and
my
heart
wellnigh
failed
me
for
fear
of
her
cruelty
presently
then
i
heard
a
stirring
in
her
chamber
and
i
slipped
from
out
the
bed
and
hid
me
behind
the
hangings
and
was
like
to
die
for
fear
of
her
and
lo
presently
she
came
stealing
in
softly
holding
a
lamp
in
one
hand
and
a
knife
in
the
other
and
i
tell
thee
of
a
sooth
that
i
also
had
a
sharp
knife
in
my
hand
to
defend
my
life
if
need
were
she
held
the
lamp
up
above
her
head
before
she
drew
near
to
the
and
i
heard
her
mutter
is
not
there
then
but
she
shall
be
taken
then
she
went
up
to
the
bed
and
stooped
over
it
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
place
where
i
had
lain
and
therewith
her
eyes
turned
to
that
false
image
of
thee
lying
there
and
she
fell
and
shaking
and
the
lamp
fell
to
the
ground
and
was
quenched
but
there
was
bright
moonlight
in
the
room
and
still
i
could
see
what
betid
but
she
uttered
a
noise
like
the
low
roar
of
a
wild
beast
and
i
saw
her
arm
and
hand
rise
up
and
the
flashing
of
the
steel
beneath
the
hand
and
then
down
came
the
hand
and
the
steel
and
i
went
nigh
to
swooning
lest
perchance
i
had
wrought
over
well
and
thine
image
were
thy
very
self
the
dastard
died
without
a
groan
why
should
i
lament
him
i
can
not
but
the
lady
drew
him
toward
her
and
snatched
the
clothes
from
off
his
shoulders
and
breast
and
fell
sounds
mostly
without
meaning
but
broken
here
and
there
with
words
then
i
heard
her
say
shall
forget
i
shall
forget
and
the
new
days
shall
come
then
was
there
silence
of
her
a
little
and
thereafter
she
cried
out
in
a
terrible
voice
no
no
no
i
can
not
forget
i
can
not
forget
and
she
raised
a
great
wailing
cry
that
filled
all
the
night
with
horror
didst
thou
not
hear
it
and
caught
up
the
knife
from
the
bed
and
thrust
it
into
her
breast
and
fell
down
a
dead
heap
over
the
bed
and
on
to
the
man
whom
she
had
slain
and
then
i
thought
of
thee
and
joy
smote
across
my
terror
how
shall
i
gainsay
it
and
i
fled
away
to
thee
and
i
took
thine
hands
in
mine
thy
dear
hands
and
we
fled
away
together
shall
we
be
still
together
he
spoke
slowly
and
touched
her
not
and
she
forbearing
all
sobbing
and
weeping
sat
looking
wistfully
on
him
he
said
i
think
thou
hast
told
me
all
and
whether
thy
guile
slew
her
or
her
own
evil
heart
she
was
slain
last
night
who
lay
in
mine
arms
the
night
before
it
was
ill
and
ill
done
of
me
for
i
loved
not
her
but
thee
and
i
wished
for
her
death
that
i
might
be
with
thee
thou
wottest
this
and
still
thou
lovest
me
it
may
be
overweeningly
what
have
i
to
say
then
if
there
be
any
guilt
of
guile
i
also
was
in
the
guile
and
if
there
be
any
guilt
of
murder
i
also
was
in
the
murder
thus
we
say
to
each
other
and
to
god
and
his
hallows
we
say
two
have
conspired
to
slay
the
woman
who
tormented
one
of
us
and
would
have
slain
the
other
and
if
we
have
done
amiss
therein
then
shall
we
two
together
pay
the
penalty
for
in
this
have
we
done
as
one
body
and
one
soul
therewith
he
put
his
arms
about
her
and
kissed
her
but
soberly
and
friendly
as
if
he
would
comfort
her
and
thereafter
he
said
to
her
maybe
in
the
sunlight
i
will
ask
thee
of
this
woman
what
she
verily
was
but
now
let
her
be
and
thou
thou
art
and
i
bid
thee
sleep
so
he
went
about
and
gathered
of
bracken
a
great
heap
for
her
bed
and
did
his
coat
thereover
and
led
her
thereto
and
she
lay
down
meekly
and
smiled
and
crossed
her
arms
over
her
bosom
and
presently
fell
asleep
but
as
for
him
he
watched
by
the
till
dawn
began
to
glimmer
and
then
he
also
laid
him
down
and
slept
chapter
xxv
of
the
triumphant
summer
array
of
the
maid
when
the
day
was
bright
walter
arose
and
met
the
maid
coming
from
the
fresh
and
rosy
from
the
water
she
paled
a
little
when
they
met
face
to
face
and
she
shrank
from
him
shyly
but
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
her
frankly
and
the
two
were
glad
and
had
no
need
to
tell
each
other
of
their
joy
though
much
else
they
deemed
they
had
to
say
could
they
have
found
words
thereto
so
they
came
to
their
fire
and
sat
down
and
fell
to
breakfast
and
ere
they
were
done
the
maid
said
my
master
thou
seest
we
be
come
nigh
unto
the
and
about
sunset
belike
we
shall
come
into
the
land
of
the
and
both
it
is
that
there
is
peril
if
we
fall
into
their
hands
and
that
we
may
scarce
escape
them
yet
i
deem
that
we
may
deal
with
the
peril
by
wisdom
what
is
the
peril
said
walter
i
mean
what
is
the
worst
of
it
said
the
maid
to
be
offered
up
in
sacrifice
to
their
god
but
if
we
escape
death
at
their
hands
what
then
said
walter
one
of
two
things
said
she
the
first
that
they
shall
take
us
into
their
tribe
and
will
they
sunder
us
in
that
case
said
walter
nay
said
she
walter
laughed
and
said
therein
is
little
harm
then
but
what
is
the
other
chance
said
she
that
we
leave
them
with
their
goodwill
and
come
back
to
one
of
the
lands
of
christendom
said
walter
i
am
not
all
so
sure
that
this
is
the
better
of
the
two
choices
though
forsooth
thou
seemest
to
think
so
but
tell
me
now
what
like
is
their
god
that
they
should
offer
up
to
him
their
god
is
a
woman
she
said
and
the
mother
of
their
nation
and
tribes
or
so
they
deem
before
the
days
when
they
had
chieftains
and
lords
of
battle
that
will
be
long
ago
said
he
how
then
may
she
be
living
now
said
the
maid
doubtless
that
woman
of
yore
agone
is
dead
this
many
and
many
a
year
but
they
take
to
them
still
a
new
woman
one
after
other
as
they
may
happen
on
them
to
be
in
the
stead
of
the
ancient
mother
and
to
tell
thee
the
very
truth
right
out
she
that
lieth
dead
in
the
pillared
hall
was
even
the
last
of
these
and
now
if
they
knew
it
they
lack
a
god
this
shall
we
tell
them
yea
yea
said
walter
a
goodly
welcome
shall
we
have
of
them
then
if
we
come
amongst
them
with
our
hands
red
with
the
blood
of
their
god
she
smiled
on
him
and
said
if
i
come
amongst
them
with
the
tidings
that
i
have
slain
her
and
they
trow
therein
without
doubt
they
shall
make
me
lady
and
goddess
in
her
stead
this
is
a
strange
word
said
walter
but
if
so
they
do
how
shall
that
further
us
in
reaching
the
kindreds
of
the
world
and
the
folk
of
holy
church
she
laughed
outright
so
joyous
was
she
grown
now
that
she
knew
that
his
life
was
yet
to
be
a
part
of
hers
sweetheart
she
said
now
i
see
that
thou
desirest
wholly
what
i
desire
yet
in
any
case
abiding
with
them
would
be
living
and
not
dying
even
as
thou
hadst
it
now
but
forsooth
they
will
not
hinder
our
departure
if
they
deem
me
their
god
they
do
not
look
for
it
nor
desire
it
that
their
god
should
dwell
with
them
daily
have
no
fear
then
she
laughed
again
and
said
what
thou
lookest
on
me
and
deemest
me
to
be
but
a
sorry
image
of
a
goddess
and
me
with
my
scanty
coat
and
bare
arms
and
naked
feet
but
wait
i
know
well
how
to
array
me
when
the
time
cometh
thou
shalt
see
it
and
now
my
master
were
it
not
meet
that
we
took
to
the
road
so
they
arose
and
found
a
ford
of
the
river
that
took
the
maid
but
to
the
knee
and
so
set
forth
up
the
greensward
of
the
slopes
whereas
there
were
but
few
trees
so
went
they
faring
toward
the
at
the
last
they
were
come
to
the
feet
of
the
very
hills
and
in
the
hollows
betwixt
the
buttresses
of
them
grew
nut
and
berry
trees
and
the
greensward
round
about
them
was
both
thick
and
much
flowery
there
they
stayed
them
and
dined
whereas
walter
had
shot
a
hare
by
the
way
and
they
had
found
a
bubbling
spring
under
a
grey
stone
in
a
bight
of
the
coppice
wherein
now
the
birds
were
singing
their
best
when
they
had
eaten
and
had
rested
somewhat
the
maid
arose
and
said
now
shall
the
queen
array
herself
and
seem
like
a
very
goddess
then
she
fell
to
work
while
walter
looked
on
and
she
made
a
garland
for
her
head
of
eglantine
where
the
roses
were
the
fairest
and
with
mingled
flowers
of
the
summer
she
wreathed
her
middle
about
and
let
the
garland
of
them
hang
down
to
below
her
knees
and
knots
of
the
flowers
she
made
fast
to
the
skirts
of
her
coat
and
did
them
for
about
her
arms
and
for
anklets
and
sandals
for
her
feet
then
she
set
a
garland
about
walter
head
and
then
stood
a
little
off
from
him
and
set
her
feet
together
and
lifted
up
her
arms
and
said
lo
now
am
i
not
as
like
to
the
mother
of
summer
as
if
i
were
clad
in
silk
and
gold
and
even
so
shall
i
be
deemed
by
the
folk
of
the
bear
come
now
thou
shalt
see
how
all
shall
be
well
she
laughed
joyously
but
he
might
scarce
laugh
for
pity
of
his
love
then
they
set
forth
again
and
began
to
climb
the
hills
and
the
hours
wore
as
they
went
in
sweet
converse
till
at
last
walter
looked
on
the
maid
and
smiled
on
her
and
said
one
thing
i
would
say
to
thee
lovely
friend
to
wit
wert
thou
clad
in
silk
and
gold
thy
stately
raiment
might
well
suffer
a
few
stains
or
here
and
there
a
rent
maybe
but
stately
would
it
be
still
when
the
folk
of
the
bear
should
come
up
against
thee
but
as
to
this
flowery
array
of
thine
in
a
few
hours
it
shall
be
all
faded
and
nought
nay
even
now
as
i
look
on
thee
the
that
hangeth
from
thy
has
waxen
dull
and
welted
and
the
blossoming
eyebright
that
is
for
a
hem
to
the
little
white
coat
of
thee
is
already
forgetting
how
to
be
bright
and
blue
what
sayest
thou
then
she
laughed
at
his
word
and
stood
still
and
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
while
with
her
fingers
she
dealt
with
the
flowers
about
her
side
like
to
a
bird
preening
his
feathers
then
she
said
is
it
verily
so
as
thou
sayest
look
again
so
he
looked
and
wondered
for
lo
beneath
his
eyes
the
spires
of
the
grew
crisp
and
clear
again
the
eyebright
blossoms
shone
once
more
over
the
whiteness
of
her
legs
the
eglantine
roses
opened
and
all
was
as
fresh
and
bright
as
if
it
were
still
growing
on
its
own
roots
he
wondered
and
was
even
somedeal
aghast
but
she
said
dear
friend
be
not
troubled
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
i
am
wise
in
hidden
lore
but
in
my
wisdom
shall
be
no
longer
any
scathe
to
any
man
and
again
this
my
wisdom
as
i
told
thee
erst
shall
end
on
the
day
whereon
i
am
made
all
happy
and
it
is
thou
that
shall
wield
it
all
my
master
yet
must
my
wisdom
needs
endure
for
a
little
season
yet
let
us
on
then
boldly
and
happily
chapter
xxvi
they
come
to
the
folk
of
the
bears
on
they
went
and
before
long
they
were
come
up
on
to
the
where
was
scarce
a
tree
save
gnarled
and
knotty
here
and
there
but
nought
else
higher
than
the
whin
and
here
on
these
upper
lands
they
saw
that
the
pastures
were
much
burned
with
the
drought
albeit
summer
was
not
worn
old
now
they
went
making
due
south
toward
the
mountains
whose
heads
they
saw
from
time
to
time
rising
deep
blue
over
the
bleak
greyness
of
the
ridges
and
so
they
went
till
at
last
hard
on
sunset
after
they
had
climbed
long
over
a
high
bent
they
came
to
the
brow
thereof
and
looking
down
beheld
new
tidings
there
was
a
wide
valley
below
them
greener
than
the
downs
which
they
had
come
over
and
greener
yet
amidmost
from
the
watering
of
a
stream
which
all
beset
with
willows
wound
about
the
bottom
sheep
and
neat
were
pasturing
about
the
dale
and
moreover
a
long
line
of
smoke
was
going
up
straight
into
the
windless
heavens
from
the
midst
of
a
ring
of
little
round
houses
built
of
turfs
and
thatched
with
reed
and
beyond
that
toward
an
bight
of
the
dale
they
could
see
what
looked
like
to
a
of
big
stones
though
there
were
no
rocky
places
in
that
land
about
the
amidst
of
the
houses
and
here
and
there
otherwhere
they
saw
standing
or
going
to
and
fro
huge
figures
of
men
and
women
with
children
playing
about
betwixt
them
they
stood
and
gazed
down
at
it
for
a
minute
or
two
and
though
all
were
at
peace
there
yet
to
walter
at
least
it
seemed
strange
and
awful
he
spake
softly
as
though
he
would
not
have
his
voice
reach
those
men
though
they
were
forsooth
out
of
earshot
of
anything
save
a
shout
are
these
then
the
children
of
the
bear
what
shall
we
do
now
she
said
yea
of
the
bear
they
be
though
there
be
other
folks
of
them
far
and
far
away
to
the
northward
and
eastward
near
to
the
borders
of
the
sea
and
as
to
what
we
shall
do
let
us
go
down
at
once
and
peacefully
indeed
by
now
there
will
be
no
escape
from
them
for
lo
you
they
have
seen
us
forsooth
some
three
or
four
of
the
big
men
had
turned
them
toward
the
bent
whereon
stood
the
twain
and
were
hailing
them
in
huge
rough
voices
wherein
howsoever
seemed
to
be
no
anger
or
threat
so
the
maid
took
walter
by
the
hand
and
thus
they
went
down
quietly
and
the
folk
seeing
them
stood
all
together
facing
them
to
abide
their
coming
walter
saw
of
them
that
though
they
were
very
tall
and
bigly
made
they
were
not
so
far
above
the
stature
of
men
as
to
be
marvels
the
carles
were
and
shaggy
of
beard
and
their
hair
all
red
or
tawny
their
skins
where
their
naked
flesh
showed
were
burned
brown
with
sun
and
weather
but
to
a
fair
and
pleasant
brown
nought
like
to
blackamoors
the
queans
were
comely
and
nor
was
there
anything
of
fierce
or
about
either
the
carles
or
the
queans
but
somewhat
grave
and
solemn
of
aspect
were
they
clad
were
they
all
saving
the
young
but
somewhat
scantily
and
in
nought
save
or
for
weapons
they
saw
amongst
them
clubs
and
spears
headed
with
bone
or
flint
and
ugly
axes
of
big
flints
set
in
wooden
handles
nor
was
there
as
far
as
they
could
see
either
now
or
afterward
any
bow
amongst
them
but
some
of
the
young
men
seemed
to
have
slings
done
about
their
shoulders
now
when
they
were
come
but
three
fathom
from
them
the
maid
lifted
up
her
voice
and
spake
clearly
and
sweetly
hail
ye
folk
of
the
bears
we
have
come
amongst
you
and
that
for
your
good
and
not
for
your
hurt
wherefore
we
would
know
if
we
be
welcome
there
was
an
old
man
who
stood
foremost
in
the
midst
clad
in
a
mantle
of
worked
very
goodly
and
with
a
gold
ring
on
his
arm
and
a
chaplet
of
blue
stones
on
his
head
and
he
spake
little
are
ye
but
so
goodly
that
if
ye
were
but
bigger
we
should
deem
that
ye
were
come
from
the
gods
house
yet
have
i
heard
that
how
mighty
soever
may
the
gods
be
and
chiefly
our
god
they
be
at
whiles
nought
so
bigly
made
as
we
of
the
bears
how
this
may
be
i
wot
not
but
if
ye
be
not
of
the
gods
or
their
kindred
then
are
ye
mere
aliens
and
we
know
not
what
to
do
with
aliens
save
we
meet
them
in
battle
or
give
them
to
the
god
or
save
we
make
them
children
of
the
bear
but
yet
again
ye
may
be
messengers
of
some
folk
who
would
bind
friendship
and
alliance
with
us
in
which
case
ye
shall
at
the
least
depart
in
peace
and
whiles
ye
are
with
us
shall
be
our
guests
in
all
good
cheer
now
therefore
we
bid
you
declare
the
matter
unto
us
then
spake
the
maid
father
it
were
easy
for
us
to
declare
what
we
be
unto
you
here
present
but
meseemeth
ye
who
be
gathered
round
the
fire
here
this
evening
are
less
than
the
whole
tale
of
the
children
of
the
bear
so
it
is
maiden
said
the
elder
that
many
more
children
hath
the
bear
this
then
we
bid
you
said
the
maid
that
ye
send
the
tokens
round
and
gather
your
people
to
you
and
when
they
be
assembled
in
the
then
shall
we
put
our
errand
before
you
and
according
to
that
shall
ye
deal
with
us
thou
hast
spoken
well
said
the
elder
and
even
so
had
we
bidden
you
ourselves
before
noon
shall
ye
stand
in
the
in
this
dale
and
speak
with
the
children
of
the
bear
therewith
he
turned
to
his
own
folk
and
called
out
something
whereof
those
twain
knew
not
the
meaning
and
there
came
to
him
one
after
another
six
young
men
unto
each
of
whom
he
gave
a
thing
from
out
his
pouch
but
what
it
was
walter
might
not
see
save
that
it
was
little
and
of
small
account
to
each
also
he
spake
a
word
or
two
and
straight
they
set
off
running
one
after
the
other
turning
toward
the
bent
which
was
over
against
that
whereby
the
twain
had
come
into
the
dale
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
in
the
gathering
dusk
then
the
elder
turned
him
again
to
walter
and
the
maid
and
spake
man
and
woman
whatsoever
ye
may
be
or
whatsoever
may
abide
you
ye
are
welcome
guests
to
us
so
we
bid
you
come
eat
and
drink
at
our
fire
so
they
sat
all
together
upon
the
grass
round
about
the
embers
of
the
fire
and
ate
curds
and
cheese
and
drank
milk
in
abundance
and
as
the
night
grew
on
them
they
quickened
the
fire
that
they
might
have
light
this
wild
folk
talked
merrily
amongst
themselves
with
laughter
enough
and
friendly
jests
but
to
the
they
were
though
as
the
twain
deemed
for
no
enmity
that
they
bore
them
but
this
found
walter
that
the
younger
ones
both
men
and
women
seemed
to
find
it
a
hard
matter
to
keep
their
eyes
off
them
and
seemed
withal
to
gaze
on
them
with
somewhat
of
doubt
or
it
might
be
of
fear
so
when
the
night
was
wearing
a
little
the
elder
arose
and
bade
the
twain
to
come
with
him
and
led
them
to
a
small
house
or
booth
which
was
amidmost
of
all
and
somewhat
bigger
than
the
others
and
he
did
them
to
wit
that
they
should
rest
there
that
night
and
bade
them
sleep
in
peace
and
without
fear
till
the
morrow
so
they
entered
and
found
beds
thereon
of
heather
and
ling
and
they
laid
them
down
sweetly
like
brother
and
sister
when
they
had
kissed
each
other
but
they
noted
that
four
brisk
men
lay
without
the
booth
and
across
the
door
with
their
weapons
beside
them
so
that
they
must
needs
look
upon
themselves
as
captives
then
walter
might
not
refrain
him
but
spake
sweet
and
dear
friend
i
have
come
a
long
way
from
the
quay
at
langton
and
the
vision
of
the
dwarf
the
maid
and
the
lady
and
for
this
kiss
wherewith
i
have
kissed
thee
now
and
the
kindness
of
thine
eyes
it
was
worth
the
time
and
the
travail
but
meseemeth
i
shall
go
no
further
in
this
world
though
my
journey
be
far
longer
than
from
langton
hither
and
now
may
god
and
all
hallows
keep
thee
amongst
this
wild
folk
whenas
i
shall
be
gone
from
thee
she
laughed
low
and
sweetly
and
said
dear
friend
dost
thou
speak
to
me
thus
mournfully
to
move
me
to
love
thee
better
then
is
thy
labour
lost
for
no
better
may
i
love
thee
than
now
i
do
and
that
is
with
mine
whole
heart
but
keep
a
good
courage
i
bid
thee
for
we
be
not
sundered
yet
nor
shall
we
be
nor
do
i
deem
that
we
shall
die
here
or
but
many
years
hence
after
we
have
known
all
the
sweetness
of
life
meanwhile
i
bid
thee
fair
friend
chapter
xxvii
morning
amongst
the
bears
so
walter
laid
him
down
and
fell
asleep
and
knew
no
more
till
he
awoke
in
bright
daylight
with
the
maid
standing
over
him
she
was
fresh
from
the
water
for
she
had
been
to
the
river
to
bathe
her
and
the
sun
through
the
open
door
fell
streaming
on
her
feet
close
to
pillow
he
turned
about
and
cast
his
arm
about
them
and
caressed
them
while
she
stood
smiling
upon
him
then
he
arose
and
looked
on
her
and
said
how
thou
art
fair
and
bright
this
morning
and
yet
and
yet
were
it
not
well
that
thou
do
off
thee
all
this
faded
and
drooping
bravery
of
leaves
and
blossoms
that
maketh
thee
look
like
to
a
jongleur
damsel
on
a
morrow
of
and
he
gazed
ruefully
on
her
she
laughed
on
him
merrily
and
said
yea
and
belike
these
others
think
no
better
of
my
attire
or
not
much
better
for
yonder
they
are
gathering
small
wood
for
the
which
forsooth
shall
be
thou
and
i
unless
i
better
it
all
by
means
of
the
wisdom
i
learned
of
the
old
woman
and
perfected
betwixt
the
stripes
of
my
mistress
whom
a
little
while
ago
thou
lovedst
somewhat
and
as
she
spake
her
eyes
sparkled
her
cheek
flushed
and
her
limbs
and
her
feet
seemed
as
if
they
could
scarce
refrain
from
dancing
for
joy
then
walter
knit
his
brow
and
for
a
moment
a
thought
was
in
his
mind
is
it
so
that
she
will
bewray
me
and
live
without
me
and
he
cast
his
eyes
on
to
the
ground
but
she
said
look
up
and
into
mine
eyes
friend
and
see
if
there
be
in
them
any
falseness
toward
thee
for
i
know
thy
thought
i
know
thy
thought
dost
thou
not
see
that
my
joy
and
gladness
is
for
the
love
of
thee
and
the
thought
of
the
rest
from
trouble
that
is
at
hand
he
looked
up
and
his
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
her
love
and
he
would
have
cast
his
arms
about
her
but
she
drew
aback
and
said
nay
thou
must
refrain
thee
awhile
dear
friend
lest
these
folk
cast
eyes
on
us
and
deem
us
over
for
what
i
am
to
bid
them
deem
me
abide
a
while
and
then
shall
all
be
in
me
according
to
thy
will
but
now
i
must
tell
thee
that
it
is
not
very
far
from
noon
and
that
the
bears
are
streaming
into
the
dale
and
already
there
is
an
host
of
men
at
the
ring
and
as
i
said
the
bale
for
the
is
wellnigh
dight
whether
it
be
for
us
or
for
some
other
creature
and
now
i
have
to
bid
thee
this
and
it
will
be
a
thing
easy
for
thee
to
do
to
wit
that
thou
look
as
if
thou
wert
of
the
race
of
the
gods
and
not
to
blench
or
show
sign
of
blenching
whatever
betide
to
both
my
and
my
say
and
lastly
this
which
is
the
only
hard
thing
for
thee
but
thou
hast
already
done
it
before
somewhat
to
look
upon
me
with
no
masterful
eyes
of
love
nor
as
if
thou
wert
at
once
praying
me
and
commanding
me
rather
thou
shalt
so
demean
thee
as
if
thou
wert
my
man
all
simply
and
nowise
my
master
o
friend
beloved
said
walter
here
at
least
art
thou
the
master
and
i
will
do
all
thy
bidding
in
certain
hope
of
this
that
either
we
shall
live
together
or
die
together
but
as
they
spoke
in
came
the
elder
and
with
him
a
young
maiden
bearing
with
them
their
breakfast
of
curds
arid
cream
and
strawberries
and
he
bade
them
eat
so
they
ate
and
were
not
unmerry
and
the
while
of
their
eating
the
elder
talked
with
them
soberly
but
not
hardly
or
with
any
seeming
enmity
and
ever
his
talk
gat
on
to
the
drought
which
was
now
burning
up
the
and
how
the
grass
in
the
watered
dales
which
was
no
wide
spread
of
land
would
not
hold
out
much
longer
unless
the
god
sent
them
rain
and
walter
noted
that
those
two
the
elder
and
the
maid
eyed
each
other
curiously
amidst
of
this
talk
the
elder
intent
on
what
she
might
say
and
if
she
gave
heed
to
his
words
while
on
her
side
the
maid
answered
his
speech
graciously
and
pleasantly
but
said
little
that
was
of
any
import
nor
would
she
have
him
fix
her
eyes
which
wandered
lightly
from
this
thing
to
that
nor
would
her
lips
grow
stern
and
stable
but
ever
smiled
in
answer
to
the
light
of
her
eyes
as
she
sat
there
with
her
face
as
the
very
face
of
the
gladness
of
the
summer
day
chapter
xxviii
of
the
new
god
of
the
bears
at
last
the
old
man
said
my
children
ye
shall
now
come
with
me
unto
the
of
our
folk
the
bears
of
the
southern
dales
and
deliver
to
them
your
errand
and
i
beseech
you
to
have
pity
upon
your
own
bodies
as
i
have
pity
on
them
on
thine
especially
maiden
so
fair
and
bright
a
creature
as
thou
art
for
so
it
is
that
if
ye
deal
us
out
light
and
lying
words
after
the
manner
of
dastards
ye
shall
miss
the
worship
and
glory
of
wending
away
amidst
of
the
flames
a
gift
to
the
god
and
a
hope
to
the
people
and
shall
be
passed
by
the
rods
of
the
folk
until
ye
faint
and
fail
amongst
them
and
then
shall
ye
be
thrust
down
into
the
flow
at
the
dale
end
and
a
hurdle
cast
upon
you
that
we
may
thenceforth
forget
your
folly
the
maid
now
looked
full
into
his
eyes
and
walter
deemed
that
the
old
man
shrank
before
her
but
she
said
thou
art
old
and
wise
o
great
man
of
the
bears
yet
nought
i
need
to
learn
of
thee
now
lead
us
on
our
way
to
the
stead
of
the
errands
so
the
elder
brought
them
along
to
the
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
dale
and
it
was
now
all
peopled
with
those
huge
men
weaponed
after
their
fashion
and
standing
up
so
that
the
grey
stones
thereof
but
showed
a
little
over
their
heads
but
amidmost
of
the
said
ring
was
a
big
stone
fashioned
as
a
chair
whereon
sat
a
very
old
man
and
and
on
either
side
of
him
stood
a
woman
clad
in
holding
each
of
them
a
long
spear
and
with
a
bladed
knife
in
the
girdle
and
there
were
no
other
women
in
all
the
mote
then
the
elder
led
those
twain
into
the
midst
of
the
mote
and
there
bade
them
go
up
on
to
a
wide
stone
six
feet
above
the
ground
just
over
against
the
ancient
chieftain
and
they
mounted
it
by
a
rough
stair
and
stood
there
before
that
folk
walter
in
his
array
of
the
outward
world
which
had
been
fair
enough
of
crimson
cloth
and
silk
and
white
linen
but
was
now
and
worn
and
the
maid
with
nought
upon
her
save
the
smock
wherein
she
had
fled
from
the
golden
house
of
the
wood
beyond
the
world
decked
with
the
faded
flowers
which
she
had
wreathed
about
her
yesterday
nevertheless
so
it
was
that
those
big
men
eyed
her
intently
and
with
somewhat
of
worship
now
did
walter
according
to
her
bidding
sink
down
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
drawing
his
sword
hold
it
before
him
as
if
to
keep
all
interlopers
aloof
from
the
maid
and
there
was
silence
in
the
mote
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
those
twain
at
last
the
old
chief
arose
and
spake
ye
men
here
are
come
a
man
and
a
woman
we
know
not
whence
whereas
they
have
given
word
to
our
folk
who
first
met
them
that
they
would
tell
their
errand
to
none
save
the
mote
of
the
people
which
it
was
their
due
to
do
if
they
were
minded
to
risk
it
for
either
they
be
aliens
without
an
errand
hither
save
it
may
be
to
beguile
us
in
which
case
they
shall
presently
die
an
evil
death
or
they
have
come
amongst
us
that
we
may
give
them
to
the
god
with
edge
and
fire
or
they
have
a
message
to
us
from
some
folk
or
other
on
the
issue
of
which
lieth
life
or
death
now
shall
ye
hear
what
they
have
to
say
concerning
themselves
and
their
faring
hither
but
meseemeth
it
shall
be
the
woman
who
is
the
chief
and
hath
the
word
in
her
mouth
for
lo
you
the
man
kneeleth
at
her
feet
as
one
who
would
serve
and
worship
her
speak
out
then
woman
and
let
our
warriors
hear
thee
then
the
maid
lifted
up
her
voice
and
spake
out
clear
and
shrilling
like
to
a
flute
of
the
best
of
the
minstrels
ye
men
of
the
children
of
the
bear
i
would
ask
you
a
question
and
let
the
chieftain
who
sitteth
before
me
answer
it
the
old
man
nodded
his
head
and
she
went
on
tell
me
children
of
the
bear
how
long
a
time
is
worn
since
ye
saw
the
god
of
your
worship
made
manifest
in
the
body
of
a
woman
said
the
elder
many
winters
have
worn
since
my
father
father
was
a
child
and
saw
the
very
god
in
the
bodily
form
of
a
woman
then
she
said
again
did
ye
rejoice
at
her
coming
and
would
ye
rejoice
if
once
more
she
came
amongst
you
yea
said
the
old
chieftain
for
she
gave
us
gifts
and
learned
us
lore
and
came
to
us
in
no
terrible
shape
but
as
a
young
woman
as
goodly
as
thou
then
said
the
maid
now
then
is
the
day
of
your
gladness
come
for
the
old
body
is
dead
and
i
am
the
new
body
of
your
god
come
amongst
you
for
your
welfare
then
fell
a
great
silence
on
the
mote
till
the
old
man
spake
and
said
what
shall
i
say
and
live
for
if
thou
be
verily
the
god
and
i
threaten
thee
wilt
thou
not
destroy
me
but
thou
hast
spoken
a
great
word
with
a
sweet
mouth
and
hast
taken
the
burden
of
blood
on
thy
lily
hands
and
if
the
children
of
the
bear
be
befooled
of
light
liars
how
shall
they
put
the
shame
off
them
therefore
i
say
show
to
us
a
token
and
if
thou
be
the
god
this
shall
be
easy
to
thee
and
if
thou
show
it
not
then
is
thy
falsehood
manifest
and
thou
shalt
dree
the
weird
for
we
shall
deliver
thee
into
the
hands
of
these
women
here
who
shall
thrust
thee
down
into
the
flow
which
is
hereby
after
they
have
wearied
themselves
with
whipping
thee
but
thy
man
that
kneeleth
at
thy
feet
shall
we
give
to
the
true
god
and
he
shall
go
to
her
by
the
road
of
the
flint
and
the
fire
hast
thou
heard
then
give
to
us
the
sign
and
the
token
she
changed
countenance
no
whit
at
his
word
but
her
eyes
were
the
brighter
and
her
cheek
the
fresher
and
her
feet
moved
a
little
as
if
they
were
growing
glad
before
the
dance
and
she
looked
out
over
the
mote
and
spake
in
her
clear
voice
old
man
thou
needest
not
to
fear
for
thy
words
forsooth
it
is
not
me
whom
thou
threatenest
with
stripes
and
a
foul
death
but
some
light
fool
and
liar
who
is
not
here
now
hearken
i
wot
well
that
ye
would
have
somewhat
of
me
to
wit
that
i
should
send
you
rain
to
end
this
drought
which
otherwise
seemeth
like
to
lie
long
upon
you
but
this
rain
i
must
go
into
the
mountains
of
the
south
to
fetch
it
you
therefore
shall
certain
of
your
warriors
bring
me
on
my
way
with
this
my
man
up
to
the
great
pass
of
the
said
mountains
and
we
shall
set
out
thitherward
this
very
day
she
was
silent
a
while
and
all
looked
on
her
but
none
spake
or
moved
so
that
they
seemed
as
images
of
stone
amongst
the
stones
then
she
spake
again
and
said
some
would
say
men
of
the
bear
that
this
were
a
sign
and
a
token
great
enough
but
i
know
you
and
how
stubborn
and
perverse
of
heart
ye
be
and
how
that
the
gift
not
yet
within
your
hand
is
no
gift
to
you
and
the
wonder
ye
see
not
your
hearts
trow
not
therefore
look
ye
upon
me
as
here
i
stand
i
who
have
come
from
the
fairer
country
and
the
greenwood
of
the
lands
and
see
if
i
bear
not
the
summer
with
me
and
the
heart
that
maketh
increase
and
the
hand
that
giveth
lo
then
as
she
spake
the
faded
flowers
that
hung
about
her
gathered
life
and
grew
fresh
again
the
woodbine
round
her
neck
and
her
sleek
shoulders
knit
itself
together
and
embraced
her
freshly
and
cast
its
scent
about
her
face
the
lilies
that
girded
her
loins
lifted
up
their
heads
and
the
gold
of
their
tassels
fell
upon
her
the
eyebright
grew
clean
blue
again
upon
her
smock
the
eglantine
found
its
blooms
again
and
then
began
to
shed
the
leaves
thereof
upon
her
feet
the
wreathed
amongst
it
made
clear
the
sweetness
of
her
legs
and
the
ear
studded
her
raiment
as
with
gems
there
she
stood
amidst
of
the
blossoms
like
a
great
orient
pearl
against
the
fretwork
of
the
goldsmiths
and
the
breeze
that
came
up
the
valley
from
behind
bore
the
sweetness
of
her
fragrance
all
over
the
then
indeed
the
bears
stood
up
and
shouted
and
cried
and
smote
on
their
shields
and
tossed
their
spears
aloft
then
the
elder
rose
from
his
seat
and
came
up
humbly
to
where
she
stood
and
prayed
her
to
say
what
she
would
have
done
while
the
others
drew
about
in
knots
but
durst
not
come
very
nigh
to
her
she
answered
the
ancient
chief
and
said
that
she
would
depart
presently
toward
the
mountains
whereby
she
might
send
them
the
rain
which
they
lacked
and
that
thence
she
would
away
to
the
southward
for
a
while
but
that
they
should
hear
of
her
or
it
might
be
see
her
before
they
who
were
now
of
middle
age
should
be
gone
to
their
fathers
then
the
old
man
besought
her
that
they
might
make
her
a
litter
of
fragrant
green
boughs
and
so
bear
her
away
toward
the
mountain
pass
amidst
a
triumph
of
the
whole
folk
but
she
leapt
lightly
down
from
the
stone
and
walked
to
and
fro
on
the
greensward
while
it
seemed
of
her
that
her
feet
scarce
touched
the
grass
and
she
spake
to
the
ancient
chief
where
he
still
kneeled
in
worship
of
her
and
said
nay
deemest
thou
of
me
that
i
need
bearing
by
men
hands
or
that
i
shall
tire
at
all
when
i
am
doing
my
will
and
i
the
very
heart
of
the
increase
so
it
is
that
the
going
of
my
feet
over
your
pastures
shall
make
them
to
thrive
both
this
year
and
the
coming
years
surely
will
i
go
afoot
so
they
worshipped
her
the
more
and
blessed
her
and
then
first
of
all
they
brought
meat
the
daintiest
they
might
both
for
her
and
for
walter
but
they
would
not
look
on
the
maid
whiles
she
ate
or
suffer
walter
to
behold
her
the
while
afterwards
when
they
had
eaten
some
twenty
men
weaponed
after
their
fashion
made
them
ready
to
wend
with
the
maiden
up
into
the
mountains
and
anon
they
set
out
thitherward
all
together
howbeit
the
huge
men
held
them
ever
somewhat
aloof
from
the
maid
and
when
they
came
to
the
for
that
night
where
was
no
house
for
it
was
up
amongst
the
before
the
mountains
then
it
was
a
wonder
to
see
how
carefully
they
built
up
a
for
her
and
tilted
it
over
with
their
and
how
they
watched
nightlong
about
her
but
walter
they
let
sleep
peacefully
on
the
grass
a
little
way
aloof
from
the
watchers
round
the
maid
chapter
xxix
walter
strays
in
the
pass
and
is
sundered
from
the
maid
morning
came
and
they
arose
and
went
on
their
ways
and
went
all
day
till
the
sun
was
nigh
set
and
they
were
come
up
into
the
very
pass
and
in
the
jaws
thereof
was
an
earthen
howe
there
the
maid
bade
them
stay
and
she
went
up
on
to
the
howe
and
stood
there
and
spake
to
them
and
said
o
men
of
the
bear
i
give
you
thanks
for
your
following
and
i
bless
you
and
promise
you
the
increase
of
the
earth
but
now
ye
shall
turn
aback
and
leave
me
to
go
my
ways
and
my
man
with
the
iron
sword
shall
follow
me
now
maybe
i
shall
come
amongst
the
again
before
long
and
yet
again
and
learn
them
wisdom
but
for
this
time
it
is
enough
and
i
shall
tell
you
that
ye
were
best
to
hasten
home
straightway
to
your
houses
in
the
downland
dales
for
the
weather
which
i
have
bidden
for
you
is
even
now
coming
forth
from
the
forge
of
storms
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
now
this
last
word
i
give
you
that
times
are
changed
since
i
wore
the
last
shape
of
god
that
ye
have
seen
wherefore
a
change
i
command
you
if
so
be
aliens
come
amongst
you
i
will
not
that
ye
send
them
to
me
by
the
flint
and
the
fire
rather
unless
they
be
baleful
unto
you
and
worthy
of
an
evil
death
ye
shall
suffer
them
to
abide
with
you
ye
shall
make
them
become
children
of
the
bears
if
they
be
goodly
enough
and
worthy
and
they
shall
be
my
children
as
ye
be
otherwise
if
they
be
and
weakling
let
them
live
and
be
thralls
to
you
but
not
join
with
you
man
to
woman
now
depart
ye
with
my
blessing
therewith
she
came
down
from
the
mound
and
went
her
ways
up
the
pass
so
lightly
that
it
was
to
walter
standing
amongst
the
bears
as
if
she
had
vanished
away
but
the
men
of
that
folk
abode
standing
and
worshipping
their
god
for
a
little
while
and
that
while
he
durst
not
sunder
him
from
their
company
but
when
they
had
blessed
him
and
gone
on
their
way
backward
he
betook
him
in
haste
to
following
the
maid
thinking
to
find
her
abiding
him
in
some
nook
of
the
pass
howsoever
it
was
now
twilight
or
more
and
for
all
his
haste
dark
night
overtook
him
so
that
perforce
he
was
stayed
amidst
the
tangle
of
the
mountain
ways
and
moreover
ere
the
night
was
grown
old
the
weather
came
upon
him
on
the
back
of
a
great
south
wind
so
that
the
mountain
nooks
rattled
and
roared
and
there
was
the
rain
and
the
hail
with
thunder
and
lightning
monstrous
and
terrible
and
all
the
huge
array
of
a
summer
storm
so
he
was
driven
at
last
to
crouch
under
a
big
rock
and
abide
the
day
but
not
so
were
his
troubles
at
an
end
for
under
the
said
rock
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
awoke
it
was
day
indeed
but
as
to
the
pass
the
way
thereby
was
blind
with
the
driving
rain
and
the
lowering
lift
so
that
though
he
struggled
as
well
as
he
might
against
the
storm
and
the
tangle
he
made
but
little
way
and
now
once
more
the
thought
came
on
him
that
the
maid
was
of
the
fays
or
of
some
race
even
mightier
and
it
came
on
him
now
not
as
erst
with
half
fear
and
whole
desire
but
with
a
bitter
oppression
of
dread
of
loss
and
misery
so
that
he
began
to
fear
that
she
had
but
won
his
love
to
leave
him
and
forget
him
for
a
after
the
wont
of
as
old
tales
tell
two
days
he
battled
thus
with
storm
and
blindness
and
wanhope
of
his
life
for
he
was
growing
weak
and
fordone
but
the
third
morning
the
storm
abated
though
the
rain
yet
fell
heavily
and
he
could
see
his
way
somewhat
as
well
as
feel
it
withal
he
found
that
now
his
path
was
leading
him
downwards
as
it
grew
dusk
he
came
down
into
a
grassy
valley
with
a
stream
running
through
it
to
the
southward
and
the
rain
was
now
but
little
coming
down
but
in
dashes
from
time
to
time
so
he
crept
down
to
the
and
lay
amongst
the
bushes
there
and
said
to
himself
that
on
the
morrow
he
would
get
him
victual
so
that
he
might
live
to
seek
his
maiden
through
the
wide
world
he
was
of
somewhat
better
heart
but
now
that
he
was
laid
quiet
and
had
no
more
for
that
present
to
trouble
him
about
the
way
the
anguish
of
his
loss
fell
upon
him
the
keener
and
he
might
not
refrain
him
from
lamenting
his
dear
maiden
aloud
as
one
who
deemed
himself
in
the
empty
wilderness
and
thus
he
lamented
for
her
sweetness
and
her
loveliness
and
the
kindness
of
her
voice
and
her
speech
and
her
mirth
then
he
fell
to
crying
out
concerning
the
beauty
of
her
shaping
praising
the
parts
of
her
body
as
her
face
and
her
hands
and
her
shoulders
and
her
feet
and
cursing
the
evil
fate
which
had
sundered
him
from
the
friendliness
of
her
and
the
peerless
fashion
of
her
chapter
xxx
now
they
meet
again
complaining
he
fell
asleep
from
sheer
weariness
and
when
he
awoke
it
was
broad
day
calm
and
bright
and
cloudless
with
the
scent
of
the
earth
refreshed
going
up
into
the
heavens
and
the
birds
singing
sweetly
in
the
bushes
about
him
for
the
dale
whereunto
he
was
now
come
was
a
fair
and
lovely
place
amidst
the
shelving
slopes
of
the
mountains
a
paradise
of
the
wilderness
and
nought
but
pleasant
and
sweet
things
were
to
be
seen
there
now
that
the
morn
was
so
clear
and
sunny
he
arose
and
looked
about
him
and
saw
where
a
hundred
yards
aloof
was
a
thicket
of
small
wood
as
thorn
and
elder
and
whitebeam
all
wreathed
about
with
the
bines
of
wayfaring
tree
it
hid
a
bight
of
the
stream
which
turned
round
about
it
and
betwixt
it
and
walter
was
the
grass
short
and
thick
and
sweet
and
all
beset
with
flowers
and
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
even
such
a
place
as
wherein
the
angels
were
leading
the
blessed
in
the
great
painted
paradise
in
the
choir
of
the
big
church
at
langton
on
holm
but
lo
as
he
looked
he
cried
aloud
for
joy
for
forth
from
the
thicket
on
to
the
flowery
grass
came
one
like
to
an
angel
from
out
of
the
said
picture
and
sweet
of
flesh
with
bright
eyes
and
ruddy
cheeks
for
it
was
the
maid
herself
so
he
ran
to
her
and
she
abode
him
holding
forth
kind
hands
to
him
and
smiling
while
she
wept
for
joy
of
the
meeting
he
threw
himself
upon
her
and
spared
not
to
kiss
her
her
cheeks
and
her
mouth
and
her
arms
and
her
shoulders
and
wheresoever
she
would
suffer
it
till
at
last
she
drew
aback
a
little
laughing
on
him
for
love
and
said
forbear
now
friend
for
it
is
enough
for
this
time
and
tell
me
how
thou
hast
sped
ill
ill
said
he
what
ails
thee
she
said
hunger
he
said
and
longing
for
thee
well
she
said
me
thou
hast
there
is
one
ill
quenched
take
my
hand
and
we
will
see
to
the
other
one
so
he
took
her
hand
and
to
hold
it
seemed
to
him
sweet
beyond
measure
but
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
little
blue
smoke
going
up
into
the
air
from
beyond
the
thicket
and
he
laughed
for
he
was
weak
with
hunger
and
he
said
who
is
at
the
cooking
yonder
thou
shalt
see
she
said
and
led
him
therewith
into
the
said
thicket
and
through
it
and
lo
a
fair
little
grassy
place
full
of
flowers
betwixt
the
bushes
and
the
bight
of
the
stream
and
on
the
little
sandy
ere
just
off
the
greensward
was
a
fire
of
sticks
and
beside
it
two
trouts
lying
fat
and
here
is
the
breakfast
said
she
when
it
was
time
to
wash
the
night
off
me
now
i
went
down
the
strand
here
into
the
rippling
shallow
and
saw
the
bank
below
it
where
the
water
draws
together
yonder
and
deepens
that
it
seemed
like
to
hold
fish
and
whereas
i
looked
to
meet
thee
presently
i
groped
the
bank
for
them
going
softly
and
lo
thou
help
me
now
that
we
cook
them
so
they
roasted
them
on
the
red
embers
and
fell
to
and
ate
well
both
of
them
and
drank
of
the
water
of
the
stream
out
of
each
other
hollow
hands
and
that
feast
seemed
glorious
to
them
such
gladness
went
with
it
but
when
they
were
done
with
their
meat
walter
said
to
the
maid
and
how
didst
thou
know
that
thou
shouldst
see
me
presently
she
said
looking
on
him
wistfully
this
needed
no
wizardry
i
lay
not
so
far
from
thee
last
night
but
that
i
heard
thy
voice
and
knew
it
said
he
why
didst
thou
not
come
to
me
then
since
thou
heardest
me
bemoaning
thee
she
cast
her
eyes
down
and
plucked
at
the
flowers
and
grass
and
said
it
was
dear
to
hear
thee
praising
me
i
knew
not
before
that
i
was
so
sore
desired
or
that
thou
hadst
taken
such
note
of
my
body
and
found
it
so
dear
then
she
reddened
sorely
and
said
i
knew
not
that
aught
of
me
had
such
beauty
as
thou
didst
bewail
and
she
wept
for
joy
then
she
looked
on
him
and
smiled
and
said
wilt
thou
have
the
very
truth
of
it
i
went
close
up
to
thee
and
stood
there
hidden
by
the
bushes
and
the
night
and
amidst
thy
bewailing
i
knew
that
thou
wouldst
soon
fall
asleep
and
in
sooth
i
thee
then
was
she
silent
again
and
he
spake
not
but
looked
on
her
shyly
and
she
said
reddening
yet
more
furthermore
i
must
needs
tell
thee
that
i
feared
to
go
to
thee
in
the
dark
night
and
my
heart
so
yearning
towards
thee
and
she
hung
her
head
adown
but
he
said
is
it
so
indeed
that
thou
fearest
me
then
doth
that
make
me
afraid
afraid
of
thy
for
i
was
going
to
entreat
thee
and
say
to
thee
beloved
we
have
now
gone
through
many
troubles
let
us
now
take
a
good
reward
at
once
and
wed
together
here
amidst
this
sweet
and
pleasant
house
of
the
mountains
ere
we
go
further
on
our
way
if
indeed
we
go
further
at
all
for
where
shall
we
find
any
place
sweeter
or
happier
than
this
but
she
sprang
up
to
her
feet
and
stood
there
trembling
before
him
because
of
her
love
and
she
said
beloved
i
have
deemed
that
it
were
good
for
us
to
go
seek
mankind
as
they
live
in
the
world
and
to
live
amongst
them
and
as
for
me
i
will
tell
thee
the
sooth
to
wit
that
i
long
for
this
sorely
for
i
feel
afraid
in
the
wilderness
and
as
if
i
needed
help
and
protection
against
my
mistress
though
she
be
dead
and
i
need
the
comfort
of
many
people
and
the
throngs
of
the
cities
i
can
not
forget
her
it
was
but
last
night
that
i
dreamed
i
suppose
as
the
dawn
grew
that
i
was
yet
under
her
hand
and
she
was
stripping
me
for
the
torment
so
that
i
woke
up
panting
and
crying
out
i
pray
thee
be
not
angry
with
me
for
telling
thee
of
my
desires
for
if
thou
wouldst
not
have
it
so
then
here
will
i
abide
with
thee
as
thy
mate
and
strive
to
gather
courage
he
rose
up
and
kissed
her
face
and
said
nay
i
had
in
sooth
no
mind
to
abide
here
for
ever
i
meant
but
that
we
should
feast
a
while
here
and
then
depart
sooth
it
is
that
if
thou
dreadest
the
wilderness
somewhat
i
dread
the
city
she
turned
pale
and
said
thou
shalt
have
thy
will
my
friend
if
it
must
be
so
but
bethink
thee
we
be
not
yet
at
our
journey
end
and
may
have
many
things
and
much
strife
to
endure
before
we
be
at
peace
and
in
welfare
now
shall
i
tell
thee
did
i
not
before
that
while
i
am
a
maid
untouched
my
wisdom
and
somedeal
of
might
abideth
with
me
and
only
so
long
therefore
i
entreat
thee
let
us
go
now
side
by
side
out
of
this
fair
valley
even
as
we
are
so
that
my
wisdom
and
might
may
help
thee
at
need
for
my
friend
i
would
not
that
our
lives
be
short
so
much
of
joy
as
hath
now
come
into
them
yea
beloved
he
said
let
us
on
straightway
then
and
shorten
the
while
that
sundereth
us
love
she
said
thou
shalt
pardon
me
one
time
for
all
but
this
is
to
be
said
that
i
know
somewhat
of
the
haps
that
lie
a
little
way
ahead
of
us
partly
by
my
lore
and
partly
by
what
i
learned
of
this
land
of
the
wild
folk
whiles
thou
wert
lying
asleep
that
morning
so
they
left
that
pleasant
place
by
the
water
and
came
into
the
open
valley
and
went
their
ways
through
the
pass
and
it
soon
became
stony
again
as
they
mounted
the
bent
which
went
up
from
out
the
dale
and
when
they
came
to
the
brow
of
the
said
bent
they
had
a
sight
of
the
open
country
lying
fair
and
joyous
in
the
sunshine
and
amidst
of
it
against
the
blue
hills
the
walls
and
towers
of
a
great
city
then
said
the
maid
o
dear
friend
lo
you
is
not
that
our
abode
that
lieth
yonder
and
is
so
beauteous
dwell
not
our
friends
there
and
our
protection
against
uncouth
wights
and
mere
evil
things
in
guileful
shapes
o
city
i
bid
thee
hail
but
walter
looked
on
her
and
smiled
somewhat
and
said
i
rejoice
in
thy
joy
but
there
be
evil
things
in
yonder
city
also
though
they
be
not
fays
nor
devils
or
it
is
like
to
no
city
that
i
wot
of
and
in
every
city
shall
foes
grow
up
to
us
without
rhyme
or
reason
and
life
therein
shall
be
tangled
unto
us
yea
she
said
but
in
the
wilderness
amongst
the
devils
what
was
to
be
done
by
manly
might
or
valiancy
there
hadst
thou
to
fall
back
upon
the
guile
and
wizardry
which
i
had
filched
from
my
very
foes
but
when
we
come
down
yonder
then
shall
thy
valiancy
prevail
to
cleave
the
tangle
for
us
or
at
the
least
it
shall
leave
a
tale
of
thee
behind
and
i
shall
worship
thee
he
laughed
and
his
face
grew
brighter
mastery
mows
the
meadow
quoth
he
and
one
man
is
of
little
might
against
many
but
i
promise
thee
i
shall
not
be
slothful
before
thee
chapter
xxxi
they
come
upon
new
folk
with
that
they
went
down
from
the
bent
again
and
came
to
where
the
pass
narrowed
so
much
that
they
went
betwixt
a
steep
wall
of
rock
on
either
side
but
after
an
hour
going
the
said
wall
gave
back
suddenly
and
or
they
were
ware
almost
they
came
on
another
dale
like
to
that
which
they
had
left
but
not
so
fair
though
it
was
grassy
and
well
watered
and
not
so
big
either
but
here
indeed
befell
a
change
to
them
for
lo
tents
and
pavilions
pitched
in
the
said
valley
and
amidst
of
it
a
throng
of
men
mostly
weaponed
and
with
horses
ready
saddled
at
hand
so
they
stayed
their
feet
and
walter
heart
failed
him
for
he
said
to
himself
who
wotteth
what
these
men
may
be
save
that
they
be
aliens
it
is
most
like
that
we
shall
be
taken
as
thralls
and
then
at
the
best
we
shall
be
sundered
and
that
is
all
one
with
the
worst
but
the
maid
when
she
saw
the
horses
and
the
gay
tents
and
the
pennons
fluttering
and
the
glitter
of
spears
and
gleaming
of
white
armour
smote
her
palms
together
for
joy
and
cried
out
here
now
are
come
the
folk
of
the
city
for
our
welcoming
and
fair
and
lovely
are
they
and
of
many
things
shall
they
be
thinking
and
a
many
things
shall
they
do
and
we
shall
be
partakers
thereof
come
then
and
let
us
meet
them
fair
friend
but
walter
said
alas
thou
knowest
not
would
that
we
might
flee
but
now
is
it
over
late
so
put
we
a
good
face
on
it
and
go
to
them
quietly
as
erewhile
we
did
in
the
so
did
they
and
there
sundered
six
from
the
and
came
to
those
twain
and
made
humble
obeisance
to
walter
but
spake
no
word
then
they
made
as
they
would
lead
them
to
the
others
and
the
twain
went
with
them
wondering
and
came
into
the
ring
of
and
stood
before
an
old
hoar
knight
armed
all
save
his
head
with
most
goodly
armour
and
he
also
bowed
before
walter
but
spake
no
word
then
they
took
them
to
the
master
pavilion
and
made
signs
to
them
to
sit
and
they
brought
them
dainty
meat
and
good
wine
and
the
while
of
their
eating
arose
up
a
stir
about
them
and
when
they
were
done
with
their
meat
the
ancient
knight
came
to
them
still
bowing
in
courteous
wise
and
did
them
to
wit
by
signs
that
they
should
depart
and
when
they
were
without
they
saw
all
the
other
tents
struck
and
men
beginning
to
busy
them
with
striking
the
pavilion
and
the
others
mounted
and
ranked
in
good
order
for
the
road
and
there
were
two
before
them
wherein
they
were
bidden
to
mount
walter
in
one
and
the
maid
in
the
other
and
no
otherwise
might
they
do
then
presently
was
a
horn
blown
and
all
took
to
the
road
together
and
walter
saw
betwixt
the
curtains
of
the
litter
that
rode
on
either
side
of
him
albeit
they
had
left
him
his
sword
by
his
side
so
they
went
down
the
and
before
sunset
were
gotten
into
the
plain
but
they
made
no
stay
for
nightfall
save
to
eat
a
morsel
and
drink
a
draught
going
through
the
night
as
men
who
knew
their
way
well
as
they
went
walter
wondered
what
would
betide
and
if
peradventure
they
also
would
be
for
offering
them
up
to
their
gods
whereas
they
were
aliens
for
certain
and
belike
also
saracens
moreover
there
was
a
cold
fear
at
his
heart
that
he
should
be
sundered
from
the
maid
whereas
their
masters
now
were
mighty
men
of
war
holding
in
their
hands
that
which
all
men
desire
to
wit
the
manifest
beauty
of
a
woman
yet
he
strove
to
think
the
best
of
it
that
he
might
and
so
at
last
when
the
night
was
far
spent
and
dawn
was
at
hand
they
stayed
at
a
great
and
mighty
gate
in
a
huge
wall
there
they
blew
loudly
on
the
horn
thrice
and
thereafter
the
gates
were
opened
and
they
all
passed
through
into
a
street
which
seemed
to
walter
in
the
glimmer
to
be
both
great
and
goodly
amongst
the
abodes
of
men
then
it
was
but
a
little
ere
they
came
into
a
square
one
side
whereof
walter
took
to
be
the
front
of
a
most
goodly
house
there
the
doors
of
the
court
opened
to
them
or
ever
the
horn
might
blow
though
forsooth
blow
it
did
loudly
three
times
all
they
entered
therein
and
men
came
to
walter
and
signed
to
him
to
alight
so
did
he
and
would
have
tarried
to
look
about
for
the
maid
but
they
suffered
it
not
but
led
him
up
a
huge
stair
into
a
chamber
very
great
and
but
dimly
lighted
because
of
its
greatness
then
they
brought
him
to
a
bed
dight
as
fair
as
might
be
and
made
signs
to
him
to
strip
and
lie
therein
perforce
he
did
so
and
then
they
bore
away
his
raiment
and
left
him
lying
there
so
he
lay
there
quietly
deeming
it
no
avail
for
him
a
man
to
seek
escape
thence
but
it
was
long
ere
he
might
sleep
because
of
his
trouble
of
mind
at
last
pure
weariness
got
the
better
of
his
hopes
and
fears
and
he
fell
into
slumber
just
as
the
dawn
was
passing
into
day
chapter
xxxii
of
the
new
king
of
the
city
and
land
of
when
he
awoke
again
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
into
that
chamber
and
he
looked
and
beheld
that
it
was
peerless
of
beauty
and
riches
amongst
all
that
he
had
ever
seen
the
ceiling
done
with
gold
and
blue
the
walls
hung
with
arras
of
the
fairest
though
he
might
not
tell
what
was
the
history
done
therein
the
chairs
and
stools
were
of
carven
work
well
and
amidmost
was
a
great
ivory
chair
under
a
cloth
of
estate
of
bawdekin
of
gold
and
green
much
and
all
the
floor
was
of
fine
work
alexandrine
he
looked
on
all
this
wondering
what
had
befallen
him
when
lo
there
came
folk
into
the
chamber
to
wit
two
and
three
old
men
clad
in
rich
gowns
of
silk
these
came
to
him
and
still
by
signs
without
speech
bade
him
arise
and
come
with
them
and
when
he
bade
them
look
to
it
that
he
was
naked
and
laughed
doubtfully
they
neither
laughed
in
answer
nor
offered
him
any
raiment
but
still
would
have
him
arise
and
he
did
so
perforce
they
brought
him
with
them
out
of
the
chamber
and
through
certain
passages
pillared
and
goodly
till
they
came
to
a
bath
as
fair
as
any
might
be
and
there
the
washed
him
carefully
and
tenderly
the
old
men
looking
on
the
while
when
it
was
done
still
they
offered
not
to
clothe
him
but
led
him
out
and
through
the
passages
again
back
to
the
chamber
only
this
time
he
must
pass
between
a
double
hedge
of
men
some
weaponed
some
in
peaceful
array
but
all
clad
gloriously
and
full
of
aspect
either
for
valiancy
or
wisdom
in
the
chamber
itself
was
now
a
concourse
of
men
of
great
estate
by
deeming
of
their
array
but
all
these
were
standing
orderly
in
a
ring
about
the
ivory
chair
aforesaid
now
said
walter
to
himself
surely
all
this
looks
toward
the
knife
and
the
altar
for
me
but
he
kept
a
stout
countenance
despite
of
all
so
they
led
him
up
to
the
ivory
chair
and
he
beheld
on
either
side
thereof
a
bench
and
on
each
was
laid
a
set
of
raiment
from
the
shirt
upwards
but
there
was
much
diversity
betwixt
these
arrays
for
one
was
all
of
robes
of
peace
glorious
and
unmeet
for
any
save
a
great
king
while
the
other
was
seemly
but
little
adorned
nay
rather
worn
and
bestained
with
weather
and
the
pelting
of
the
now
those
old
men
signed
to
walter
to
take
which
of
those
raiments
he
would
and
do
it
on
he
looked
to
the
right
and
the
left
and
when
he
had
looked
on
the
the
heart
arose
in
him
and
he
called
to
mind
the
array
of
the
goldings
in
the
forefront
of
battle
and
he
made
one
step
toward
the
weapons
and
laid
his
hand
thereon
then
ran
a
glad
murmur
through
that
concourse
and
the
old
men
drew
up
to
him
smiling
and
joyous
and
helped
him
to
do
them
on
and
as
he
took
up
the
helm
he
noted
that
over
its
broad
brown
iron
sat
a
golden
crown
so
when
he
was
clad
and
weaponed
girt
with
a
sword
and
a
steel
axe
in
his
hand
the
elders
showed
him
to
the
ivory
throne
and
he
laid
the
axe
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
drew
forth
the
sword
from
the
scabbard
and
sat
him
down
and
laid
the
ancient
blade
across
his
knees
then
he
looked
about
on
those
great
men
and
spake
how
long
shall
we
speak
no
word
to
each
other
or
is
it
so
that
god
hath
stricken
you
dumb
then
all
they
cried
out
with
one
voice
all
hail
to
the
king
the
king
of
battle
spake
walter
if
i
be
king
will
ye
do
my
will
as
i
bid
you
answered
the
elder
nought
have
we
will
to
do
lord
save
as
thou
biddest
said
walter
thou
then
wilt
thou
answer
a
question
in
all
truth
yea
lord
said
the
elder
if
i
may
live
afterward
then
said
walter
the
woman
that
came
with
me
into
your
camp
of
the
mountain
what
hath
befallen
her
the
elder
answered
nought
hath
befallen
her
either
of
good
or
evil
save
that
she
hath
slept
and
eaten
and
bathed
her
what
then
is
the
king
pleasure
concerning
her
that
ye
bring
her
hither
to
me
straightway
said
walter
yea
said
the
elder
and
in
what
guise
shall
we
bring
her
hither
shall
she
be
arrayed
as
a
servant
or
a
great
lady
then
walter
pondered
a
while
and
spake
at
last
ask
her
what
is
her
will
herein
and
as
she
will
have
it
so
let
it
be
but
set
ye
another
chair
beside
mine
and
lead
her
thereto
thou
wise
old
man
send
one
or
two
to
bring
her
in
hither
but
abide
thou
for
i
have
a
question
or
two
to
ask
of
thee
yet
and
ye
lords
abide
here
the
coming
of
my
if
it
weary
you
not
so
the
elder
spake
to
three
of
the
most
honourable
of
the
lords
and
they
went
their
ways
to
bring
in
the
maid
chapter
xxxiii
concerning
the
fashion
of
in
meanwhile
the
king
spake
to
the
elder
and
said
now
tell
me
whereof
i
am
become
king
and
what
is
the
fashion
and
cause
of
the
for
wondrous
it
is
to
me
whereas
i
am
but
an
alien
amidst
of
mighty
men
lord
said
the
old
man
thou
art
become
king
of
a
mighty
city
which
hath
under
it
many
other
cities
and
wide
lands
and
havens
by
the
side
and
which
lacketh
no
wealth
which
men
desire
many
wise
men
dwell
therein
and
of
fools
not
more
than
in
other
lands
a
valiant
host
shall
follow
thee
to
battle
when
needs
must
thou
wend
afield
an
host
not
to
be
withstood
save
by
the
ancient
if
any
of
them
were
left
upon
the
earth
as
belike
none
are
and
as
to
the
name
of
our
said
city
it
hight
the
city
of
the
or
more
shortly
now
as
to
the
fashion
of
our
if
our
king
dieth
and
leaveth
an
heir
male
begotten
of
his
body
then
is
he
king
after
him
but
if
he
die
and
leave
no
heir
then
send
we
out
a
great
lord
with
knights
and
sergeants
to
that
pass
of
the
mountain
whereto
ye
came
yesterday
and
the
first
man
that
cometh
unto
them
they
take
and
lead
to
the
city
as
they
did
with
thee
lord
for
we
believe
and
trow
that
of
old
time
our
forefathers
came
down
from
the
mountains
by
that
same
pass
poor
and
rude
but
full
of
valiancy
before
they
conquered
these
lands
and
builded
the
wall
but
now
furthermore
when
we
have
gotten
the
said
wanderer
and
brought
him
home
to
our
city
we
behold
him
all
the
great
men
of
us
both
sages
and
warriors
then
if
we
find
him
and
counterfeit
of
his
body
we
roll
him
in
a
great
carpet
till
he
dies
or
whiles
if
he
be
but
a
simple
man
and
without
guile
we
deliver
him
for
thrall
to
some
artificer
amongst
us
as
a
shoemaker
a
wright
or
what
not
and
so
forget
him
but
in
either
case
we
make
as
if
no
such
man
had
come
to
us
and
we
send
again
the
lord
and
his
knights
to
watch
the
pass
for
we
say
that
such
an
one
the
fathers
of
old
time
have
not
sent
us
but
again
when
we
have
seen
to
the
that
he
is
of
his
body
all
is
not
done
for
we
deem
that
never
would
the
fathers
send
us
a
dolt
or
a
craven
to
be
our
king
therefore
we
bid
the
naked
one
take
to
him
which
he
will
of
these
raiments
either
the
ancient
armour
which
now
thou
bearest
lord
or
this
golden
raiment
here
and
if
he
take
the
as
thou
takedst
it
king
it
is
well
but
if
he
take
the
raiment
of
peace
then
hath
he
the
choice
either
to
be
thrall
of
some
goodman
of
the
city
or
to
be
proven
how
wise
he
may
be
and
so
fare
the
narrow
edge
betwixt
death
and
kingship
for
if
he
fall
short
of
his
wisdom
then
shall
he
die
the
death
thus
is
thy
question
answered
king
and
praise
be
to
the
fathers
that
they
have
sent
us
one
whom
none
may
doubt
either
for
wisdom
or
valiancy
chapter
xxxiv
now
cometh
the
maid
to
the
king
then
all
they
bowed
before
the
king
and
he
spake
again
what
is
that
noise
that
i
hear
without
as
if
it
were
the
rising
of
the
sea
on
a
sandy
shore
when
the
wind
is
blowing
then
the
elder
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
but
before
he
might
get
out
the
word
there
was
a
stir
without
the
chamber
door
and
the
throng
parted
and
lo
amidst
of
them
came
the
maid
and
she
yet
clad
in
nought
save
the
white
coat
wherewith
she
had
won
through
the
wilderness
save
that
on
her
head
was
a
garland
of
red
roses
and
her
middle
was
wreathed
with
the
same
fresh
and
fair
she
was
as
the
dawn
of
june
her
face
bright
and
and
her
cheeks
flushed
with
hope
and
love
she
went
straight
to
walter
where
he
sat
and
lightly
put
away
with
her
hand
the
elder
who
would
lead
her
to
the
ivory
throne
beside
the
king
but
she
knelt
down
before
him
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
knee
and
said
o
my
lord
now
i
see
that
thou
hast
beguiled
me
and
that
thou
wert
all
along
a
man
coming
home
to
thy
realm
but
so
dear
thou
hast
been
to
me
and
so
fair
and
clear
and
so
kind
withal
do
thine
eyes
shine
on
me
from
under
the
grey
that
i
will
beseech
thee
not
to
cast
me
out
utterly
but
suffer
me
to
be
thy
servant
and
handmaid
for
a
while
wilt
thou
not
but
the
king
stooped
down
to
her
and
raised
her
up
and
stood
on
his
feet
and
took
her
hands
and
kissed
them
and
set
her
down
beside
him
and
said
to
her
sweetheart
this
is
now
thy
place
till
the
night
cometh
even
by
my
side
so
she
sat
down
there
meek
and
valiant
her
hands
laid
in
her
lap
and
her
feet
one
over
the
other
while
the
king
said
lords
this
is
my
beloved
and
my
spouse
now
therefore
if
ye
will
have
me
for
king
ye
must
worship
this
one
for
queen
and
lady
or
else
suffer
us
both
to
go
our
ways
in
peace
then
all
they
that
were
in
the
chamber
cried
out
aloud
the
queen
the
lady
the
beloved
of
our
lord
and
this
cry
came
from
their
hearts
and
not
their
lips
only
for
as
they
looked
on
her
and
the
brightness
of
her
beauty
they
saw
also
the
meekness
of
her
demeanour
and
the
high
heart
of
her
and
they
all
fell
to
loving
her
but
the
young
men
of
them
their
cheeks
flushed
as
they
beheld
her
and
their
hearts
went
out
to
her
and
they
drew
their
swords
and
brandished
them
aloft
and
cried
out
for
her
as
men
made
suddenly
drunk
with
love
the
queen
the
lady
the
lovely
one
chapter
xxxv
of
the
king
of
and
his
queen
but
while
this
betid
that
murmur
without
which
is
aforesaid
grew
louder
and
it
smote
on
the
king
ear
and
he
said
again
to
the
elder
tell
us
now
of
that
noise
withoutward
what
is
it
said
the
elder
if
thou
king
and
the
queen
wilt
but
arise
and
stand
in
the
window
and
go
forth
into
the
hanging
gallery
thereof
then
shall
ye
know
at
once
what
is
this
rumour
and
therewithal
shall
ye
see
a
sight
meet
to
rejoice
the
heart
of
a
king
new
come
into
kingship
so
the
king
arose
and
took
the
maid
by
the
hand
and
went
to
the
window
and
looked
forth
and
lo
the
great
square
of
the
place
all
thronged
with
folk
as
thick
as
they
could
stand
and
the
more
part
of
the
carles
with
a
weapon
in
hand
and
many
armed
right
gallantly
then
he
went
out
into
the
gallery
with
his
queen
still
holding
her
hand
and
his
lords
and
wise
men
stood
behind
him
straightway
then
arose
a
cry
and
a
shout
of
joy
and
welcome
that
rent
the
very
heavens
and
the
great
place
was
all
glittering
and
strange
with
the
tossing
up
of
spears
and
the
brandishing
of
swords
and
the
stretching
forth
of
hands
but
the
maid
spake
softly
to
king
walter
and
said
here
then
is
the
wilderness
left
behind
a
long
way
and
here
is
warding
and
protection
against
the
foes
of
our
life
and
soul
o
blessed
be
thou
and
thy
valiant
heart
but
walter
spake
nothing
but
stood
as
one
in
a
dream
and
yet
if
that
might
be
his
longing
toward
her
increased
manifold
but
down
below
amidst
of
the
throng
stood
two
neighbours
somewhat
anigh
to
the
window
and
quoth
one
to
the
other
see
thou
the
new
man
in
the
ancient
armour
of
the
battle
of
the
waters
bearing
the
sword
that
slew
the
foeman
king
on
the
day
of
the
doubtful
onset
surely
this
is
a
sign
of
to
us
all
yea
said
the
second
he
beareth
his
armour
well
and
the
eyes
are
bright
in
the
head
of
him
but
hast
thou
beheld
well
his
and
what
the
like
of
her
is
i
see
her
said
the
other
that
she
is
a
fair
woman
yet
somewhat
worse
clad
than
simply
she
is
in
her
smock
man
and
were
it
not
for
the
balusters
i
deem
ye
should
see
her
barefoot
what
is
amiss
with
her
dost
thou
not
see
her
said
the
second
neighbour
that
she
is
not
only
a
fair
woman
but
yet
more
one
of
those
lovely
ones
that
draw
the
heart
out
of
a
man
body
one
may
scarce
say
for
why
surely
hath
cast
a
lucky
net
this
time
and
as
to
her
raiment
i
see
of
her
that
she
is
clad
in
white
and
wreathed
with
roses
but
that
the
flesh
of
her
is
so
wholly
pure
and
sweet
that
it
maketh
all
her
attire
but
a
part
of
her
body
and
halloweth
it
so
that
it
hath
the
semblance
of
gems
alas
my
friend
let
us
hope
that
this
queen
will
fare
abroad
unseldom
amongst
the
people
thus
then
they
spake
but
after
a
while
the
king
and
his
mate
went
back
into
the
chamber
and
he
gave
command
that
the
women
of
the
queen
should
come
and
fetch
her
away
to
attire
her
in
royal
array
and
thither
came
the
fairest
of
the
honourable
damsels
and
were
fain
of
being
her
women
therewithal
the
king
was
unarmed
and
dight
most
gloriously
but
still
he
bore
the
sword
of
the
king
slaying
and
sithence
were
the
king
and
the
queen
brought
into
the
great
hall
of
the
palace
and
they
met
on
the
dais
and
kissed
before
the
lords
and
other
folk
that
thronged
the
hall
there
they
ate
a
morsel
and
drank
a
cup
together
while
all
beheld
them
and
then
they
were
brought
forth
and
a
white
horse
of
the
goodliest
well
bedight
brought
for
each
of
them
and
thereon
they
mounted
and
went
their
ways
together
by
the
lane
which
the
huge
throng
made
for
them
to
the
great
church
for
the
hallowing
and
the
crowning
and
they
were
led
by
one
squire
alone
and
he
unarmed
for
such
was
the
custom
of
when
a
new
king
should
be
hallowed
so
came
they
to
the
great
church
for
that
folk
was
not
miscreant
so
to
say
and
they
entered
it
they
two
alone
and
went
into
the
choir
and
when
they
had
stood
there
a
little
while
wondering
at
their
lot
they
heard
how
the
bells
fell
tunefully
over
their
heads
and
then
drew
near
the
sound
of
many
trumpets
blowing
together
and
thereafter
the
voices
of
many
folk
singing
and
then
were
the
great
doors
thrown
open
and
the
bishop
and
his
priests
came
into
the
church
with
singing
and
minstrelsy
and
thereafter
came
the
whole
throng
of
the
folk
and
presently
the
nave
of
the
church
was
filled
by
it
as
when
the
water
follows
the
cutting
of
the
dam
and
fills
up
the
dyke
thereafter
came
the
bishop
and
his
mates
into
the
choir
and
came
up
to
the
king
and
gave
him
and
the
queen
the
kiss
of
peace
this
was
mass
sung
gloriously
and
thereafter
was
the
king
anointed
and
crowned
and
great
joy
was
made
throughout
the
church
afterwards
they
went
back
afoot
to
the
palace
they
two
alone
together
with
none
but
the
esquire
going
before
to
show
them
the
way
and
as
they
went
they
passed
close
beside
those
two
neighbours
whose
talk
has
been
told
of
afore
and
the
first
one
he
who
had
praised
the
spake
and
said
truly
neighbour
thou
art
in
the
right
of
it
and
now
the
queen
has
been
dight
duly
and
hath
a
crown
on
her
head
and
is
clad
in
white
samite
done
all
over
with
pearls
i
see
her
to
be
of
exceeding
goodliness
as
goodly
maybe
as
the
lord
king
quoth
the
other
unto
me
she
seemeth
as
she
did
now
she
is
clad
in
white
as
then
she
was
and
it
is
by
reason
of
the
pure
and
sweet
flesh
of
her
that
the
pearls
shine
out
and
glow
and
by
the
holiness
of
her
body
is
her
rich
attire
hallowed
but
forsooth
it
seemed
to
me
as
she
went
past
as
though
paradise
had
come
anigh
to
our
city
and
that
all
the
air
breathed
of
it
so
i
say
praise
be
to
god
and
his
hallows
who
hath
suffered
her
to
dwell
amongst
us
said
the
first
man
forsooth
it
is
well
but
knowest
thou
at
all
whence
she
cometh
and
of
what
lineage
she
may
be
nay
said
the
other
i
wot
not
whence
she
is
but
this
i
wot
full
surely
that
when
she
goeth
away
they
whom
she
leadeth
with
her
shall
be
well
bestead
again
of
her
lineage
nought
know
i
but
this
i
know
that
they
that
come
of
her
to
the
twentieth
generation
shall
bless
and
praise
the
memory
of
her
and
hallow
her
name
little
less
than
they
hallow
the
name
of
the
mother
of
god
so
spake
those
two
but
the
king
and
queen
came
back
to
the
palace
and
sat
among
the
lords
and
at
the
banquet
which
was
held
thereafter
and
long
was
the
time
of
their
glory
till
the
night
was
far
spent
and
all
men
must
seek
to
their
beds
chapter
xxxvi
of
walter
and
the
maid
in
the
days
of
the
kingship
long
it
was
indeed
till
the
women
by
the
king
command
had
brought
the
maid
to
the
king
chamber
and
he
met
her
and
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
kissed
her
and
said
art
thou
not
weary
sweetheart
doth
not
the
city
and
the
thronging
folk
and
the
watching
eyes
of
the
great
ones
doth
it
not
all
lie
heavy
on
thee
as
it
doth
upon
me
she
said
and
where
is
the
city
now
is
not
this
the
wilderness
again
and
thou
and
i
alone
together
therein
he
gazed
at
her
eagerly
and
she
reddened
so
that
her
eyes
shone
light
amidst
the
darkness
of
the
flush
of
her
cheeks
he
spake
trembling
and
softly
and
said
is
it
not
in
one
matter
better
than
the
wilderness
is
not
the
fear
gone
yea
every
whit
thereof
the
dark
flush
had
left
her
face
and
she
looked
on
him
exceeding
sweetly
and
spoke
steadily
and
clearly
even
so
it
is
beloved
therewith
she
set
her
hand
to
the
girdle
that
girt
her
loins
and
did
it
off
and
held
it
out
toward
him
and
said
here
is
the
token
this
is
a
maid
girdle
and
the
woman
is
ungirt
so
he
took
the
girdle
and
her
hand
withal
and
cast
his
arms
about
her
and
amidst
the
sweetness
of
their
love
and
their
safety
and
assured
hope
of
many
days
of
joy
they
spake
together
of
the
hours
when
they
fared
the
betwixt
guile
and
misery
and
death
and
the
sweeter
yet
it
grew
to
them
because
of
it
and
many
things
she
told
him
ere
the
dawn
of
the
evil
days
bygone
and
the
dealings
of
the
mistress
with
her
till
the
grey
day
stole
into
the
chamber
to
make
manifest
her
loveliness
which
forsooth
was
better
even
than
the
deeming
of
that
man
amidst
the
throng
whose
heart
had
been
so
drawn
towards
her
so
they
rejoiced
together
in
the
new
day
but
when
the
full
day
was
and
walter
arose
he
called
his
thanes
and
wise
men
to
the
council
and
first
he
bade
open
the
and
feed
the
needy
and
clothe
them
and
make
good
cheer
to
all
men
high
and
low
rich
and
unrich
and
thereafter
he
took
counsel
with
them
on
many
matters
and
they
marvelled
at
his
wisdom
and
the
keenness
of
his
wit
and
so
it
was
that
some
were
but
half
pleased
thereat
whereas
they
saw
that
their
will
was
like
to
give
way
before
his
in
all
matters
but
the
wiser
of
them
rejoiced
in
him
and
looked
for
good
days
while
his
life
lasted
now
of
the
deeds
that
he
did
and
his
joys
and
his
griefs
the
tale
shall
tell
no
more
nor
of
how
he
saw
langton
again
and
his
dealings
there
in
he
dwelt
and
reigned
a
king
well
beloved
of
his
folk
sorely
feared
of
their
foemen
strife
he
had
to
deal
with
at
home
and
abroad
but
therein
he
was
not
quelled
till
he
fell
asleep
fair
and
softly
when
this
world
had
no
more
of
deeds
for
him
to
do
nor
may
it
be
said
that
the
needy
lamented
him
for
no
needy
had
he
left
in
his
own
land
and
few
foes
he
left
behind
to
hate
him
as
to
the
maid
she
so
waxed
in
loveliness
and
kindness
that
it
was
a
year
joy
for
any
to
have
cast
eyes
upon
her
in
street
or
on
field
all
wizardry
left
her
since
the
day
of
her
wedding
yet
of
wit
and
wisdom
she
had
enough
left
and
to
spare
for
she
needed
no
going
about
and
no
guile
any
more
than
hard
commands
to
have
her
will
done
so
loved
she
was
by
all
folk
forsooth
that
it
was
a
mere
joy
for
any
to
go
about
her
errands
to
be
short
she
was
the
land
increase
and
the
safeguard
and
the
bliss
of
the
folk
somewhat
as
the
days
passed
it
misgave
her
that
she
had
beguiled
the
to
deem
her
their
god
and
she
considered
and
thought
how
she
might
atone
it
so
the
second
year
after
they
had
come
to
she
went
with
certain
folk
to
the
head
of
the
pass
that
led
down
to
the
bears
and
there
she
stayed
the
and
went
on
further
with
a
two
score
of
husbandmen
whom
she
had
redeemed
from
thralldom
in
and
when
they
were
hard
on
the
dales
of
the
bears
she
left
them
there
in
a
certain
little
dale
with
their
wains
and
horses
and
and
iron
tools
and
went
down
all
to
the
dwelling
of
those
huge
men
unguarded
now
by
sorcery
and
trusting
in
nought
but
her
loveliness
and
kindness
clad
she
was
now
as
when
she
fled
from
the
wood
beyond
the
world
in
a
short
white
coat
alone
with
bare
feet
and
naked
arms
but
the
said
coat
was
now
embroidered
with
the
imagery
of
blossoms
in
silk
and
gold
and
gems
whereas
now
her
wizardry
had
departed
from
her
so
she
came
to
the
bears
and
they
knew
her
at
once
and
worshipped
and
blessed
her
and
feared
her
but
she
told
them
that
she
had
a
gift
for
them
and
was
come
to
give
it
and
therewith
she
told
them
of
the
art
of
tillage
and
bade
them
learn
it
and
when
they
asked
her
how
they
should
do
so
she
told
them
of
the
men
who
were
abiding
them
in
the
mountain
dale
and
bade
the
bears
take
them
for
their
brothers
and
sons
of
the
ancient
fathers
and
then
they
should
be
taught
of
them
this
they
behight
her
to
do
and
so
she
led
them
to
where
her
freedmen
lay
whom
the
bears
received
with
all
joy
and
and
took
them
into
their
folk
so
they
went
back
to
their
dales
together
but
the
maid
went
her
ways
back
to
her
and
the
city
of
thereafter
she
sent
more
gifts
and
messages
to
the
bears
but
never
again
went
herself
to
see
them
for
as
good
a
face
as
she
put
on
it
that
last
time
yet
her
heart
waxed
cold
with
fear
and
it
almost
seemed
to
her
that
her
mistress
was
alive
again
and
that
she
was
escaping
from
her
and
plotting
against
her
once
more
as
for
the
bears
they
throve
and
multiplied
till
at
last
strife
arose
great
and
grim
betwixt
them
and
other
peoples
for
they
had
become
mighty
in
battle
yea
once
and
again
they
met
the
host
of
in
fight
and
overthrew
and
were
overthrown
but
that
was
a
long
while
after
the
maid
had
passed
away
now
of
walter
and
the
maid
is
no
more
to
be
told
saving
that
they
begat
between
them
goodly
sons
and
fair
daughters
whereof
came
a
great
lineage
in
which
lineage
was
so
strong
and
endured
so
long
a
while
that
by
then
it
had
died
out
folk
had
clean
forgotten
their
ancient
custom
of
so
that
after
walter
of
langton
there
was
never
another
king
that
came
down
to
them
poor
and
lonely
from
out
of
the
mountains
of
the
bears
