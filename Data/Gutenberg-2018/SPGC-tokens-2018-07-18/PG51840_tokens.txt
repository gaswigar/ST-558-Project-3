i
the
encounter
glenister
gazed
out
over
the
harbor
agleam
with
the
lights
of
anchored
ships
then
up
at
the
crenelated
mountains
black
against
the
sky
he
drank
the
cool
air
burdened
with
its
taints
of
the
sea
while
the
blood
of
his
boyhood
leaped
within
him
oh
it
s
fine
fine
he
murmured
and
this
is
my
country
my
country
after
all
dex
it
s
in
my
veins
this
hunger
for
the
north

seen

plumb
drunk

t

too
strong
in
one
he
went
back
abruptly
to
his
pipe
its
villanous
fumes
promptly
averting
any
danger
of
the
air
s
too
tonic
quality

sniffed
the

you

like

you
desecrate
the
hour
of
meditation
with
rhapsodies
on
nature
when
your
æsthetics
ain
t
honed
up
to
the
beauties
of
good
the
other
laughed
inflating
his
deep
chest
in
the
gloom
he
stretched
his
muscles
restlessly
as
though
an
excess
of
vigor
filled
him
they
were
lounging
upon
the
dock
while
before
them
lay
the
ready
for
her
midnight
sailing
behind
slept
unalaska
quaint
antique
and
russian
rusting
amid
the
fogs
of
bering
sea
where
a
week
before
natives
had
dried
their
cod
among
the
old
bronze
cannon
now
a
frenzied
horde
of
paused
in
their
rush
to
the
new
el
dorado
they
had
come
like
a
locust
cloud
thousands
strong
settling
on
the
edge
of
the
smoky
sea
waiting
the
going
of
the
ice
that
barred
them
from
their
golden
fleece
from
nome
the
new
where
men
found
fortune
in
a
night
the
mossy
hills
back
of
the
village
were
ridged
with
graves
of
those
who
had
died
on
the
the
fall
before
when
a
plague
had
gripped
the
land
but
what
of
that
gold
glittered
in
the
sands
so
said
the
survivors
therefore
men
came
in
armies
glenister
and
dextry
had
left
nome
the
autumn
previous

young
man
raving
with
fever

warning
throbbing
up
the
mountain
we
ll
have
to

said
dextry
what
s
that
the
other
whispered
at
first
the
only
sound
they
heard
was
a
stir
from
the
deck
of
the
steamer
then
from
the
water
below
them
came
the
rattle
of
rowlocks
and
a
voice
cautiously
muffled
stop
stop
there
a
skiff
burst
from
the
darkness
grounding
on
the
beach
beneath
a
figure
scrambled
out
and
up
the
ladder
leading
to
the
wharf
immediately
a
second
boat
plainly
in
pursuit
of
the
first
one
struck
on
the
beach
behind
it
as
the
escaping
figure
mounted
to
their
level
the
watchers
perceived
with
amazement
that
it
was
a
young
woman
breath
sobbed
from
her
lungs
and
stumbling
she
would
have
fallen
but
for
glenister
who
ran
forward
and
helped
her
to
her
feet
don
t
let
them
get
me
she
panted
he
turned
to
his
partner
in
puzzled
inquiry
but
found
that
the
old
man
had
crossed
to
the
head
of
the
landing
ladder
up
which
the
pursuers
were
climbing
just
a
minute
you
there
back
up
or
i
ll
kick
your
face
dextry
s
voice
was
sharp
and
unexpected
and
in
the
darkness
he
loomed
tall
and
menacing
to
those
below
get
out
of
the
way
that
woman
s
a
runaway
came
from
the
one
highest
on
the
ladder
so
i
she
broke
qu
shut
up
broke
in
another
do
you
want
to
advertise
it
get
out
of
the
way
there
ye
damn
fool
climb
up
he
spoke
like
a
bucko
mate
and
his
words
stirred
the
bile
of
dextry
thorsen
grasped
the
dock
floor
trying
to
climb
up
but
the
old
miner
stamped
on
his
fingers
and
the
sailor
loosened
his
hold
with
a
yell
carrying
the
under
men
with
him
to
the
beach
in
his
fall
this
way
follow
me
shouted
the
mate
making
up
the
bank
for
the
shore
end
of
the
wharf
you
d
better
pull
your
freight
miss
dextry
remarked
they
ll
be
here
in
a
yes
yes
let
us
go
i
must
get
aboard
the
she
s
leaving
now
come
come
glenister
laughed
as
though
there
were
a
humorous
touch
in
her
remark
but
did
not
stir
i
m
gettin
awful
old
an
stiff
to
run
said
dextry
removing
his
mackinaw
but
i
allow
i
ain
t
too
old
for
a
little
diversion
in
the
way
of
a
when
it
comes
nosin
he
moved
lightly
though
the
girl
could
see
in
the
that
his
hair
was
silvery
what
do
you
mean
she
questioned
sharply
you
hurry
along
miss
we
ll
toy
with
em
till
you
re
they
stepped
across
to
the
backing
against
it
the
girl
followed
again
came
the
warning
blast
from
the
steamer
and
the
voice
of
an
officer
clear
away
that
stern
line
oh
we
ll
be
left
she
breathed
and
somehow
it
struck
glenister
that
she
feared
this
more
than
the
men
whose
approaching
feet
he
heard
can
make
it
all
right
he
urged
her
roughly
you
ll
get
hurt
if
you
stay
here
run
along
and
don
t
mind
us
we
ve
been
thirty
days
on
shipboard
and
were
praying
for
something
to
his
voice
was
boyishly
glad
as
if
he
exulted
in
the
fray
that
was
to
come
and
no
sooner
had
he
spoken
than
the
sailors
came
out
of
the
darkness
upon
them
during
the
space
of
a
few
there
was
only
a
tangle
of
whirling
forms
with
the
sound
of
fist
on
flesh
then
the
blot
split
up
and
forms
plunged
outward
falling
heavily
again
the
sailors
rushed
attempting
to
clinch
they
massed
upon
dextry
only
to
grasp
empty
air
for
he
shifted
with
remarkable
agility
striking
bitterly
as
an
old
wolf
snaps
it
was
baffling
work
however
for
in
the
darkness
his
blows
fell
short
or
overreached
glenister
on
the
other
hand
stood
carelessly
beating
the
men
off
as
they
came
to
him
he
laughed
gloatingly
deep
in
his
throat
as
though
the
encounter
were
merely
some
rough
sport
the
girl
shuddered
for
the
desperate
silence
of
the
attacking
men
terrified
illustration
what
i
want
i
take
and
then
turning
he
kissed
her
softly
fiercely
full
upon
the
lips
see
her
more
than
a
din
and
yet
she
stayed
crouched
against
the
wall
dextry
swung
at
a
dim
target
and
missing
it
was
whirled
off
his
balance
instantly
his
antagonist
grappled
with
him
and
they
fell
to
the
floor
while
a
third
man
shuffled
about
them
the
girl
throttled
a
scream
i
m
goin
to
kick
im
bill
the
man
panted
hoarsely
le
me
fix
he
swung
his
heavy
shoe
and
bill
cursed
with
stirring
eloquence
ow
you
re
kickin
me
i
ve
got
im
safe
enough
tackle
the
big
bill
s
ally
then
started
towards
the
others
his
body
bent
his
arms
flexed
yet
hanging
loosely
he
crouched
beside
the
girl
ignoring
her
while
she
heard
the
breath
wheezing
from
his
lungs
then
silently
he
leaped
glenister
had
hurled
a
man
from
him
then
stepped
back
to
avoid
the
others
when
he
was
seized
from
behind
and
felt
the
man
s
arms
wrapped
about
his
neck
the
sailor
s
legs
locked
about
his
thighs
now
came
the
girl
s
first
knowledge
of
real
fighting
the
two
spun
back
and
forth
so
closely
entwined
as
to
be
indistinguishable
the
others
holding
off
for
what
seemed
many
minutes
they
struggled
the
young
man
striving
to
reach
his
adversary
till
they
crashed
against
the
wall
near
her
and
she
heard
her
champion
s
breath
coughing
in
his
throat
at
the
tightening
grip
of
the
sailor
fright
held
her
paralyzed
for
she
had
never
seen
men
thus
a
moment
and
glenister
would
be
down
beneath
their
stamping
feet
they
would
kick
his
life
out
with
their
heavy
shoes
at
thought
of
it
the
necessity
of
action
smote
her
like
a
blow
in
the
face
her
terror
fell
away
her
shaking
muscles
stiffened
and
before
realizing
what
she
did
she
had
acted
the
seaman
s
back
was
to
her
she
reached
out
and
gripped
him
by
the
hair
while
her
fingers
tense
as
talons
sought
his
eyes
then
the
first
loud
sound
of
the
battle
arose
the
man
yelled
in
sudden
terror
and
the
others
as
suddenly
fell
back
the
next
instant
she
felt
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
heard
dextry
s
voice
are
ye
hurt
no
come
on
then
or
we
ll
get
he
spoke
quietly
though
his
breath
was
loud
and
glancing
down
she
saw
the
huddled
form
of
the
sailor
whom
he
had
fought
that
s
all
right
he
ain
t
hurt
it
s
a
jap
trick
i
learned
hurry
up
they
ran
swiftly
down
the
wharf
followed
by
glenister
and
by
the
groans
of
the
sailors
in
whom
the
lust
for
combat
had
been
quenched
as
they
scrambled
up
the
maria
a
strip
of
water
widened
between
the
boat
and
the
pier
close
shave
that
panted
glenister
feeling
his
throat
gingerly
but
i
wouldn
t
have
missed
it
for
a
spotted
i
ve
been
through
b
iler
explosions
and
not
to
mention
a
triflin
but
fer
real
sprightly
diversions
i
don
t
recall
nothin
more
pleasin
than
dextry
s
enthusiasm
was
boylike
what
kind
of
men
are
you
the
girl
laughed
nervously
but
got
no
answer
they
led
her
to
their
deck
cabin
where
they
switched
on
the
electric
light
blinking
at
each
other
and
at
their
unknown
guest
they
saw
a
graceful
and
altogether
attractive
figure
in
a
trim
short
skirt
and
long
tan
boots
but
what
glenister
first
saw
was
her
eyes
large
and
gray
almost
brown
under
the
electric
light
they
were
active
eyes
he
thought
and
they
flashed
swift
comprehensive
glances
at
the
two
men
her
hair
had
fallen
loose
and
crinkled
to
her
waist
all
agleam
otherwise
she
showed
no
sign
of
her
recent
ordeal
glenister
had
been
prepared
for
the
type
of
beauty
that
follows
the
frontier
beauty
that
may
stun
but
that
has
the
polish
and
chill
of
a
bowie
instead
this
girl
with
the
calm
reposeful
face
struck
a
note
almost
painfully
different
from
her
surroundings
suggesting
countless
pleasant
things
that
had
been
strange
to
him
for
the
past
few
years
pure
admiration
alone
was
patent
in
the
older
man
s
gaze
i
make
oration
said
he
that
you
re
the
gamest
little
chap
i
ever
fought
over
mexikin
injun
or
white
what
s
the
trouble
i
suppose
you
think
i
ve
done
something
dreadful
don
t
you
she
said
but
i
haven
t
i
had
to
get
away
from
the
for
certain
reasons
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
i
haven
t
stolen
anything
nor
poisoned
the
crew
really
i
haven
she
smiled
at
them
and
glenister
found
it
impossible
not
to
smile
with
her
though
dismayed
by
her
feeble
explanation
well
i
ll
wake
up
the
steward
and
find
a
place
for
you
to
go
he
said
at
length
you
ll
have
to
double
up
with
some
of
the
women
though
it
s
awfully
crowded
she
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
his
arm
he
thought
he
felt
her
tremble
no
no
i
don
t
want
you
to
do
that
they
mustn
t
see
me
i
know
i
m
acting
strangely
and
all
that
but
it
s
happened
so
quickly
i
haven
t
found
myself
yet
i
ll
tell
you
though
really
don
t
let
any
one
see
me
or
it
will
spoil
everything
wait
till
she
was
very
white
and
spoke
with
eager
intensity
help
you
why
sure
mike
assured
the
impulsive
dextry
an
see
here
miss
you
take
your
time
on
explanations
we
don
t
care
a
cuss
what
you
done
morals
ain
t
our
long
suit
cause
there
s
never
a
law
of
god
or
man
runs
north
of
as
the
poetry
man
remarked
an
he
couldn
t
have
spoke
truer
if
he
d
knowed
what
he
was
sayin
everybody
is
privileged
to
look
out
his
own
game
up
here
a
square
deal
an
no
questions
she
looked
somewhat
doubtful
at
this
till
she
caught
the
heat
of
glenister
s
gaze
some
boldness
of
his
look
brought
home
to
her
the
actual
situation
and
a
stain
rose
in
her
cheek
she
noted
him
more
carefully
noted
his
heavy
shoulders
and
ease
of
bearing
an
ease
and
looseness
begotten
of
perfect
muscular
control
strength
was
equally
suggested
in
his
face
she
thought
for
he
carried
a
marked
young
countenance
with
thrusting
chin
aggressive
thatching
brows
and
mobile
mouth
that
whispered
all
the
changes
from
strength
to
abandon
prominent
was
a
look
of
reckless
energy
she
considered
him
handsome
in
a
heavy
virile
perhaps
too
purely
physical
fashion
you
want
to
stowaway
he
asked
i
ve
had
a
right
smart
experience
in
that
line
said
dextry
but
i
never
done
it
by
proxy
what
s
your
plan
she
will
stay
here
said
glenister
quickly
you
and
i
will
go
below
nobody
will
see
i
can
t
let
you
do
that
she
objected
isn
t
there
some
place
where
i
can
hide
but
they
reassured
her
and
left
when
they
had
gone
she
crouched
trembling
upon
her
seat
for
a
long
time
gazing
fixedly
before
her
i
m
afraid
she
whispered
i
m
afraid
what
am
i
getting
into
why
do
men
look
so
at
me
i
m
frightened
oh
i
m
sorry
i
undertook
at
last
she
rose
wearily
the
close
cabin
oppressed
her
she
felt
the
need
of
fresh
air
so
turning
out
the
lights
she
stepped
forth
into
the
night
figures
loomed
near
the
rail
and
she
slipped
astern
screening
herself
behind
a
where
the
cool
breeze
fanned
her
face
the
forms
she
had
seen
approached
speaking
earnestly
instead
of
passing
they
stopped
abreast
of
her
then
as
they
began
to
talk
she
saw
that
her
retreat
was
cut
off
and
that
she
must
not
stir
what
brings
her
here
glenister
was
echoing
a
question
of
dextry
s
bah
what
brings
them
all
what
brought
the
duchess
and
cherry
malotte
and
all
the
rest
no
no
said
the
old
man
she
ain
t
that
kind
she
s
too
fine
too
delicate
too
that
s
just
it
too
pretty
too
pretty
to
be
alone
or
anything
except
what
she
dextry
growled
sourly
this
country
has
plumb
ruined
you
boy
you
think
they
re
all
alike
an
i
don
t
know
but
they
are
all
but
this
girl
seems
like
she
s
different
somehow
but
i
can
t
glenister
spoke
musingly
i
had
an
ancestor
who
buccaneered
among
the
indies
a
long
time
ago
so
i
m
told
sometimes
i
think
i
have
his
disposition
he
comes
and
whispers
things
to
me
in
the
night
oh
he
was
a
devil
and
i
ve
got
his
blood
in
me
untamed
and
hot
i
can
hear
him
saying
something
now
something
about
the
spoils
of
war
ha
ha
maybe
he
s
right
i
fought
for
her
dex
the
way
he
used
to
fight
for
his
sweethearts
along
the
mexicos
she
s
too
beautiful
to
be
good
and
there
s
never
a
law
of
god
or
man
runs
north
of
they
moved
on
his
vibrant
cynical
laughter
stabbing
the
girl
till
she
leaned
against
the
yawl
for
support
she
held
herself
together
while
the
blood
beat
thickly
in
her
ears
then
fled
to
the
cabin
hurling
herself
into
her
berth
where
she
writhed
silently
beating
the
pillow
with
hands
into
which
her
nails
had
bitten
staring
the
while
into
the
darkness
with
dry
and
aching
eyes
chapter
ii
the
stowaway
she
awoke
to
the
throb
of
the
engines
and
gazing
cautiously
through
her
stateroom
window
saw
a
glassy
level
sea
with
the
sun
brightly
agleam
on
it
so
this
was
bering
she
had
clothed
it
always
with
the
mystery
of
her
thinking
of
it
as
a
weeping
stretch
of
gray
waters
instead
she
saw
a
flat
sunlit
main
with
occasional
flapping
their
fat
bodies
out
of
the
ship
s
course
a
glistening
head
popped
up
from
the
waters
abreast
and
she
heard
the
cry
of
seal
dressing
the
girl
noted
minutely
the
personal
articles
scattered
about
the
cabin
striving
to
derive
therefrom
some
fresh
hint
of
the
characteristics
of
the
owners
first
there
was
an
elaborate
all
richly
ornamented
and
the
metal
was
magnificently
and
bore
glenister
s
initial
it
spoke
of
elegant
extravagance
and
seemed
oddly
out
of
place
in
an
arctic
miner
s
equipment
as
did
also
a
small
set
of
de
maupassant
next
she
picked
up
kipling
s
marked
liberally
and
felt
that
she
had
struck
a
scent
the
roughness
and
brutality
of
the
poems
had
always
chilled
her
though
she
had
felt
vaguely
their
splendid
pulse
and
swing
this
was
the
girl
s
first
venture
from
a
sheltered
life
she
had
not
rubbed
elbows
with
the
world
enough
to
find
that
truth
may
be
rough
unshaven
and
garbed
in
homespun
the
book
confirmed
her
analysis
of
the
junior
partner
pendent
from
a
hook
was
a
worn
and
blackened
holster
from
which
peeped
the
butt
of
a
large
colt
s
revolver
showing
evidence
of
many
years
service
it
spoke
mutely
of
the
dextry
who
before
her
inspection
was
over
knocked
at
the
door
and
when
she
admitted
him
addressed
her
cautiously
the
boy
s
down
forrad
teasin
grub
out
of
a
flunky
he
ll
be
up
in
a
minute
how
d
ye
sleep
very
well
thank
you
she
lied
but
i
ve
been
thinking
that
i
ought
to
explain
myself
to
now
see
here
the
old
man
interjected
there
ain
t
no
explanations
needed
till
you
feel
like
givin
them
up
you
was
in
trouble
that
s
unfortunate
we
help
you
that
s
natural
no
questions
asked
that
s
yes
but
i
know
you
must
think
what
bothers
me
the
other
continued
irrelevantly
is
how
in
blazes
we
re
goin
to
keep
you
hid
the
steward
s
got
to
make
up
this
room
and
somebody
s
bound
to
see
us
packin
grub
i
don
t
care
who
knows
if
they
won
t
send
me
back
they
wouldn
t
do
that
would
they
she
hung
anxiously
on
his
words
send
you
back
why
don
t
you
savvy
that
this
boat
is
bound
for
nome
there
ain
t
no
turnin
back
on
gold
stampedes
and
this
is
the
wildest
rush
the
world
ever
saw
the
captain
wouldn
t
turn
back
he
couldn
t
his
cargo
s
too
precious
and
the
company
pays
five
thousand
a
day
for
this
ship
no
we
ain
t
puttin
back
to
unload
no
stowaways
at
five
thousand
per
besides
we
passengers
wouldn
t
let
him
time
s
too
they
were
interrupted
by
the
rattle
of
dishes
outside
and
dextry
was
about
to
open
the
door
when
his
hand
wavered
uncertainly
above
the
knob
for
he
heard
the
hearty
greeting
of
the
ship
s
captain
well
well
glenister
where
s
all
the
breakfast
going
oo
whispered
the
old
man
that
s
cap
dextry
isn
t
feeling
quite
up
to
form
this
morning
replied
glenister
easily
don
t
wonder
why
weren
t
you
aboard
sooner
last
night
i
saw
you
most
got
left
eh
served
you
right
if
you
then
his
voice
dropped
to
the
confidential
i
d
advise
you
to
cut
out
those
women
don
t
misunderstand
me
boy
but
they
re
a
bad
lot
on
this
boat
i
saw
you
come
aboard
take
my
word
for
it
they
re
a
bad
lot
cut
em
out
guess
i
ll
step
inside
and
see
what
s
up
with
the
girl
shrank
into
her
corner
gazing
apprehensively
at
the
other
listener
well
er
he
isn
t
up
yet
they
heard
glenister
stammer
better
come
around
nonsense
it
s
time
he
was
the
master
s
voice
was
gruffly
hello
dextry
hey
open
up
for
he
rattled
the
door
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
old
miner
darted
an
inquiring
glance
at
his
companion
then
at
her
nod
slipped
the
bolt
and
the
captain
s
blue
bulk
filled
the
room
his
grizzled
face
was
genially
wrinkled
till
he
spied
the
erect
gray
figure
in
the
corner
when
his
cap
came
off
involuntarily
there
his
courtesy
ended
however
and
the
smile
died
coldly
from
his
face
his
eyes
narrowed
and
the
fell
away
leaving
him
the
stiff
and
formal
officer
ah
he
said
not
feeling
well
eh
i
thought
i
had
met
all
of
our
lady
passengers
introduce
me
dextry
squirmed
under
his
cynicism
well
i
ah
didn
t
catch
the
name
what
oh
there
ain
t
much
to
say
this
is
the
lady
we
brought
aboard
last
night
that
s
who
gave
you
permission
nobody
there
wasn
t
there
wasn
t
eh
which
one
of
you
conceived
the
novel
scheme
of
stowing
away
ladies
in
your
cabin
whose
is
she
quick
answer
indignation
was
vibrant
in
his
voice
oh
the
girl
cried
her
eyes
widening
darkly
she
stood
slim
and
pale
and
slightly
trembling
his
words
had
cut
her
bitterly
though
through
it
all
he
had
scrupulously
avoided
addressing
her
the
captain
turned
to
glenister
who
had
entered
and
closed
the
door
is
this
your
work
is
she
yours
no
he
answered
quietly
while
dextry
chimed
in
better
hear
details
captain
before
you
make
breaks
like
that
we
helped
the
lady
some
sailors
last
night
and
we
most
got
left
doing
it
it
was
up
to
her
to
make
a
quick
so
we
helped
her
a
poor
story
what
was
she
running
away
from
he
still
addressed
the
men
ignoring
her
completely
till
with
hoarse
voice
she
broke
in
you
mustn
t
talk
about
me
that
way
i
can
answer
your
questions
it
s
true
i
ran
away
i
had
to
the
sailors
came
after
me
and
fought
with
these
men
i
had
to
get
away
quickly
and
your
friends
helped
me
on
here
from
gentlemanly
kindness
because
they
saw
me
unprotected
they
are
still
protecting
me
i
can
t
explain
how
important
it
is
for
me
to
reach
nome
on
the
first
boat
because
it
isn
t
my
secret
it
was
important
enough
to
make
me
leave
my
uncle
at
seattle
at
an
hour
s
notice
when
we
found
there
was
no
one
else
who
could
go
that
s
all
i
can
say
i
took
my
maid
with
me
but
the
sailors
caught
her
just
as
she
was
following
me
down
the
ship
s
ladder
she
had
my
bag
of
clothes
when
they
seized
her
i
cast
off
the
rope
and
rowed
ashore
as
fast
as
i
could
but
they
lowered
another
boat
and
followed
the
captain
eyed
her
sharply
and
his
grim
lines
softened
a
bit
for
she
was
and
womanly
and
utterly
out
of
place
he
took
her
in
shrewdly
detail
by
detail
then
spoke
directly
to
her
my
dear
young
lady
the
other
ships
will
get
there
just
as
quickly
as
ours
maybe
more
quickly
we
strike
the
and
then
it
is
all
a
matter
of
yes
but
the
ship
i
left
won
t
get
at
this
the
commander
started
and
darting
a
great
hand
at
her
spoke
savagely
what
s
that
what
ship
which
one
did
you
come
from
answer
the
she
replied
with
the
effect
of
a
the
master
glared
at
her
the
good
god
you
to
stand
there
and
tell
me
that
he
turned
and
poured
his
rage
upon
the
others
she
says
the
d
ye
hear
you
ve
ruined
me
i
ll
put
you
in
irons
all
of
you
the
what
d
ye
mean
what
s
up
what
s
up
there
s
aboard
the
this
girl
has
broken
quarantine
the
health
inspectors
bottled
up
the
boat
at
six
o
clock
last
night
that
s
why
i
pulled
out
of
unalaska
ahead
of
time
to
avoid
any
possible
delay
now
we
ll
all
be
held
up
when
we
get
to
nome
great
heavens
do
you
realize
what
this
means
bringing
this
hussy
aboard
his
eyes
burned
and
his
voice
shook
while
the
two
partners
stared
at
each
other
in
dismay
too
well
they
knew
the
result
of
a
panic
aboard
this
crowded
not
only
was
every
available
cabin
bulging
with
passengers
but
the
lower
decks
were
jammed
with
both
humanity
and
live
stock
all
in
the
most
unsanitary
conditions
the
craft
built
for
three
hundred
passengers
was
carrying
triple
her
capacity
men
and
women
were
stowed
away
like
cattle
order
and
a
condition
were
maintained
only
by
the
efforts
of
the
passengers
themselves
who
held
to
the
thought
that
imprisonment
and
inconvenience
would
last
but
a
few
days
longer
they
had
been
aboard
three
weeks
and
every
heart
was
aflame
with
the
desire
to
reach
nome
to
reach
it
ahead
of
the
pressing
horde
behind
what
would
be
the
temper
of
this
army
if
thrown
into
quarantine
within
sight
of
their
goal
the
impatient
hundreds
would
have
to
lie
packed
in
their
floating
prison
submitting
to
the
foul
disease
long
they
must
lie
thus
till
a
month
should
illustration
she
stepped
back
against
the
wall
her
wondrous
deep
gray
eyes
wide
and
troubled
have
passed
after
the
disappearance
of
the
last
symptom
if
the
disease
recurred
sporadically
that
might
mean
endless
weeks
of
maddening
idleness
it
might
even
be
impossible
to
impose
the
necessary
restraint
there
would
be
violence
perhaps
mutiny
the
fear
of
the
sickness
was
nothing
to
dextry
and
glenister
but
of
their
mine
they
thought
with
terror
what
would
happen
in
their
absence
where
conditions
were
as
unsettled
as
in
this
new
land
where
titles
were
held
only
by
physical
possession
of
the
premises
during
the
long
winter
of
their
absence
ice
had
held
their
treasure
inviolate
but
with
the
warming
summer
the
jewel
they
had
fought
for
so
wearily
would
lie
naked
and
exposed
to
the
first
comer
the
midas
lay
in
the
valley
of
the
richest
creek
where
men
had
schemed
and
fought
and
slain
for
the
right
to
inches
it
was
the
fruit
of
cheerless
barren
years
of
toil
and
if
they
could
not
guard
it
they
knew
the
result
the
girl
interrupted
their
distressing
reflections
don
t
blame
these
men
sir
she
begged
the
captain
i
am
the
only
one
at
fault
oh
i
to
get
away
i
have
papers
here
that
must
be
delivered
she
laid
a
hand
upon
her
bosom
they
couldn
t
be
trusted
to
the
unsettled
mail
service
it
s
almost
life
and
death
and
i
assure
you
there
is
no
need
of
putting
me
in
quarantine
i
haven
t
the
i
wasn
t
even
exposed
to
there
s
nothing
else
to
do
said
stephens
i
ll
isolate
you
in
the
deck
god
knows
what
these
madmen
on
board
will
do
when
they
hear
about
it
though
they
re
apt
to
tear
you
to
shreds
they
re
crazy
glenister
had
been
thinking
rapidly
if
you
do
that
you
ll
have
mutiny
in
an
hour
this
isn
t
the
crowd
to
stand
that
sort
of
bah
let
em
try
it
i
ll
put
em
the
officer
s
square
jaws
clicked
maybe
so
but
what
then
we
reach
nome
and
the
health
inspector
hears
of
suspects
then
we
re
all
quarantined
for
thirty
days
eight
hundred
of
us
we
ll
lie
at
egg
island
all
summer
while
your
company
pays
five
thousand
a
day
for
this
ship
that
s
not
all
the
firm
is
liable
in
damages
for
your
carelessness
in
letting

the
old
man
ground
his
teeth
yes
that
s
what
it
amounts
to
you
ll
ruin
your
owners
all
right
you
ll
tie
up
your
ship
and
lose
your
job
that
s
a
cinch
captain
stephens
wiped
the
moisture
from
his
brow
angrily
my
carelessness
curse
you
you
say
it
well
don
t
you
realize
that
i
am
criminally
liable
if
i
don
t
take
every
precaution
he
paused
for
a
moment
considering
i
ll
hand
her
over
to
the
ship
s
see
here
now
glenister
urged
we
ll
be
in
nome
in
a
week
before
the
young
lady
would
have
time
to
show
symptoms
of
the
disease
even
if
she
were
going
to
have
it
and
a
thousand
to
one
she
hasn
t
been
exposed
and
will
never
show
a
trace
of
it
nobody
knows
she
s
aboard
but
we
three
nobody
will
see
her
get
off
she
ll
stay
in
this
cabin
which
will
be
just
as
effectual
as
though
you
isolated
her
in
any
other

leaning
over
the
chatting
idly
in
the
darkness
it
was
the
second
night
out
and
the
ship
lay
dead
in
the
all
about
them
was
a
flat
sea
leprous
and
mottled
in
the
deep
twilight
that
midnight
brought
in
this
latitude
they
had
threaded
into
the
as
long
as
the
light
lasted
following
the
lanes
of
blue
water
till
they
closed
then
drifting
idly
till
others
appeared
worming
out
into
leagues
of
open
sea
again
creeping
into
the
shifting
labyrinth
till
darkness
rendered
progress
perilous
occasionally
they
had
passed
herds
of
walrus
huddled
sociably
upon
their
wet
hides
glistening
in
the
sunlight
the
air
had
been
clear
and
pleasant
while
away
on
all
quarters
they
had
seen
the
smoke
of
other
ships
toiling
through
the
barrier
the
spring
fleet
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
golden
north
chafing
at
her
imprisonment
the
girl
had
asked
the
old
man
to
take
her
out
on
deck
under
the
shelter
of
darkness
then
she
had
led
him
to
speak
of
his
own
past
experiences
and
of
glenister
s
which
he
had
done
freely
she
was
frankly
curious
about
them
and
she
wondered
at
their
apparent
lack
of
interest
in
her
own
identity
and
her
secret
mission
she
even
construed
their
silence
as
indifference
not
realizing
that
these
northmen
were
offering
her
the
truest
evidence
of
the
frontier
is
capable
of
no
finer
compliment
than
this
utter
disregard
of
one
s
folded
pages
it
betokens
that
highest
faith
in
one
s
the
belief
that
he
should
be
measured
by
his
present
deeds
not
by
his
past

says
translated
this
is
god

free
country
where
a
man
is
a
man
nothing
more
our
land
is
new
and
pure
our
faces
are
to
the
front
if
you
have
been
square
so
much
the
better
if
not
leave
behind
the
taints
of
artificial
things
and
start
again
on
the
level
that
s
it
had
happened
therefore
that
since
the
men
had
asked
her
no
questions
she
had
allowed
the
hours
to
pass
and
still
hesitated
to
explain
further
than
she
had
explained
to
captain
stephens
it
was
much
easier
to
let
things
continue
as
they
were
and
there
was
after
all
so
little
that
she
was
at
liberty
to
tell
them
in
the
short
time
since
meeting
them
the
girl
had
grown
to
like
dextry
with
his
blunt
chivalry
and
boyish
whimsical
philosophy
but
she
avoided
glenister
feeling
a
shrinking
hidden
terror
of
him
ever
since
her
eavesdropping
of
the
previous
night
at
the
memory
of
that
scene
she
grew
hot
then
cold
hot
with
anger
icy
at
the
sinister
power
and
sureness
which
had
vibrated
in
his
voice
what
kind
of
life
was
she
entering
where
men
spoke
of
strange
women
with
this
assurance
and
hinted
thus
of
ownership
that
he
was
handsome
and
unconscious
of
it
she
acknowledged
and
had
she
met
him
in
her
accustomed
circle
of
friends
garbed
in
the
conventionalities
she
would
perhaps
have
thought
of
him
as
a
striking
man
vigorous
and
intelligent
but
here
he
seemed
naturally
to
take
on
the
attributes
of
his
surroundings
acquiring
a
picturesque
negligée
of
dress
and
morals
and
suggesting
rugged
elemental
chilling
potentialities
while
with
him
and
he
had
sought
her
repeatedly
that
day
she
was
uneasily
aware
of
his
strong
personality
tugging
at
her
aware
of
the
unbridled
passionate
flood
of
a
nature
unbrooking
of
delay
and
heedless
of
denial
this
it
was
that
antagonized
her
and
set
her
every
mental
sinew
in
rigid
resistance
during
dextry
s
garrulous
ramblings
glenister
emerged
from
the
darkness
and
silently
took
his
place
beside
her
against
the
rail
what
portent
do
you
see
that
makes
you
stare
into
the
night
so
anxiously
he
inquired
i
am
wishing
for
a
sight
of
the
midnight
sun
or
the
aurora
borealis
she
replied
too
late
for
one
an
too
fur
south
for
the
other
dextry
interposed
we
ll
see
the
sun
further
north
have
you
ever
heard
the
real
origin
of
the
northern
lights
the
young
man
inquired
naturally
i
never
have
she
answered
well
here
it
is
i
have
it
from
the
lips
of
a
great
hunter
of
the
tananas
he
told
it
to
me
when
i
was
sick
once
in
his
cabin
and
inasmuch
as
he
is
a
wise
indian
and
has
a
reputation
for
truth
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
scrupulously
correct
in
the
very
old
days
before
the
white
man
or
corned
beef
had
invaded
this
land
the
greatest
tribe
in
all
the
north
was
the
tananas
the
bravest
hunter
of
these
was
itika
the
second
chief
he
could
follow
a
moose
till
it
fell
exhausted
in
the
snow
and
he
had
many
belts
made
from
the
claws
of
the
brown
bear
which
is
deadly
wicked
and
as
every
one
knows
inhabited
by
the
spirits
of
or
devils
one
winter
a
terrible
famine
settled
over
the
tanana
valley
the
moose
departed
from
the
gulches
and
the
caribou
melted
from
the
hills
like
mist
the
dogs
grew
gaunt
and
howled
all
night
the
babies
cried
the
women
became
and
peevish
then
it
was
that
itika
decided
to
go
hunting
over
the
range
which
formed
the
edge
of
the
world
they
tried
to
dissuade
him
saying
it
was
certain
death
because
a
pack
of
monstrous
white
wolves
taller
than
the
moose
and
swifter
than
the
eagle
was
known
to
range
these
mountains
running
madly
in
chase
always
on
clear
cold
nights
could
be
seen
the
flashing
of
the
moonbeams
from
their
gleaming
hungry
sides
and
although
many
hunters
had
crossed
the
passes
in
other
years
they
never
returned
for
the
pack
slew
them
nothing
could
deter
itika
however
so
he
threaded
his
way
up
through
the
range
and
night
coming
burrowed
into
a
drift
to
sleep
in
his
peering
out
into
the
darkness
he
saw
the
flashing
lights
a
thousand
times
brighter
than
ever
before
the
whole
heavens
were
ablaze
with
shifting
streamers
that
raced
and
writhed
back
and
forth
in
wild
revel
listening
he
heard
the
hiss
and
whine
of
dry
snow
under
the
feet
of
the
pack
and
a
distant
noise
as
of
rushing
winds
although
the
air
was
deathly
still
with
daylight
he
proceeded
through
the
range
till
he
came
out
above
a
magnificent
valley
descending
the
slope
he
entered
a
forest
of
towering
spruce
while
on
all
sides
the
snow
was
trampled
with
tracks
as
wide
as
a
there
came
to
him
a
noise
which
as
he
proceeded
increased
till
it
filled
the
woods
it
was
a
frightful
din
as
though
a
thousand
wolves
were
howling
with
the
madness
of
the
kill
cautiously
creeping
nearer
he
found
a
monstrous
white
animal
struggling
beneath
a
spruce
which
had
fallen
upon
it
in
such
fashion
as
to
pinion
it
securely
all
brave
men
are
so
itika
set
to
work
with
his
axe
and
cleared
away
the
burden
regardless
of
the
peril
to
himself
when
he
had
released
it
the
beast
arose
and
instead
of
running
away
addressed
him
in
the
most
polite
and
polished
indian
without
a
trace
of
accent
you
have
saved
my
life
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
want
to
hunt
in
this
valley
my
people
are
starving
said
itika
at
which
the
wolf
was
greatly
pleased
and
rounded
up
the
rest
of
the
pack
to
help
in
the
kill
always
thereafter
when
itika
came
to
the
valley
of
the
yukon
the
giant
drove
hunted
with
him
to
this
day
they
run
through
the
mountains
on
cold
clear
nights
in
a
multitude
while
the
light
of
the
moon
flickers
from
their
white
sides
flashing
up
into
the
sky
in
weird
fantastic
figures
some
people
call
it
northern
lights
but
old
isaac
assured
me
earnestly
toothlessly
and
with
the
light
of
ancient
truth
as
i
lay
in
his
lodge
that
it
is
nothing
more
remarkable
than
the
spirit
of
itika
and
the
great
white
what
a
queer
legend
she
said
there
must
be
many
of
them
in
this
country
i
feel
that
i
am
going
to
like
the
perhaps
you
will
glenister
replied
although
it
is
not
a
woman
s
tell
me
what
led
you
out
here
in
the
first
place
you
are
an
eastern
man
you
have
had
advantages
education
and
yet
you
choose
this
you
must
love
the
indeed
i
do
it
calls
to
a
fellow
in
some
strange
way
that
a
gentler
country
never
could
when
once
you
ve
lived
the
long
lazy
june
days
that
never
end
and
heard
geese
honking
under
a
warm
sunlit
midnight
or
when
once
you
ve
hit
the
trail
on
a
winter
morning
so
sharp
and
clear
that
the
air
stings
your
lungs
and
the
whole
white
silent
world
glistens
like
a
jewel
yes
and
when
you
ve
seen
the
dogs
romping
in
harness
till
the
sled
runners
ring
and
the
distant
come
out
like
beautiful
carvings
so
close
you
can
reach
them
well
there
s
something
in
it
that
brings
you
back
that
s
all
no
matter
where
you
ve
lost
yourself
it
means
health
and
equality
and
unrestraint
that
s
what
i
like
best
i
dare
say
the
utter
unrestraint
when
i
was
a
i
used
to
gaze
at
the
map
of
alaska
for
hours
i
d
lose
myself
in
it
it
wasn
t
anything
but
a
big
blank
corner
in
the
north
then
with
a
name
and
mountains
and
mystery
the
word
yukon
suggested
to
me
everything
unknown
and
weird
hairy
mastodons
golden
river
bars
savage
indians
with
bone
and
trousers
when
i
left
college
i
came
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
the
adventure
i
suppose
the
law
was
considered
my
destiny
how
the
shades
of
old
choate
and
webster
and
patrick
henry
must
have
wailed
when
i
forswore
it
i
ll
bet
blackstone
tore
his
i
think
you
would
have
made
a
success
said
the
girl
but
he
laughed
well
anyhow
i
stepped
out
leaving
the
way
to
the
united
states
supreme
bench
unobstructed
and
came
north
i
found
it
was
where
i
belonged
i
fitted
in
i
m
not
contented
don
t
think
that
i
m
ambitious
but
i
prefer
these
surroundings
to
the
others
that
s
all
i
m
realizing
my
desires
i
ve
made
a
fortune
now
i
ll
see
what
else

world
he
suddenly
turned
to
her
see
here
he
abruptly
questioned
what
s
your
name
she
started
and
glanced
towards
where
dextry
had
stood
only
to
find
that
the
old
frontiersman
had
slipped
away
during
the
tale
helen
chester
she
replied
helen
chester
he
repeated
musingly
what
a
pretty
name
it
seems
almost
a
pity
to
change
it
to
marry
as
you
i
am
not
going
to
nome
to
get
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
then
you
won
t
like
this
country
you
are
two
years
too
early
you
ought
to
wait
till
there
are
railroads
and
telephones
and
d
and
chaperons
it
s
a
man

country
i
don
t
see
why
it
isn

a
woman

country
too
surely
we
can
take
a
part
in
taming
it
yonder
on
the
oregon
is
a
complete
railroad
which
will
be
running
from
the
coast
to
the
mines
in
a
few
weeks
another
ship
back
there
has
the
wire
and
poles
and
fixings
for

will
go

in

night

in

the
sailors
caught
her
you
see
i
am
not
far
ahead
of
what
part
are
you
going
to
take
in
this
taming
process
he
asked
she
paused
long
before
replying
and
when
she
did
her
answer
sounded
like
a
jest
i
herald
the
coming
of
the
law
she
said
the
law
bah
red
tape
a
dead
language
and
a
horde
of
shysters
i
m
afraid
of
law
in
this
land
we
re
too
new
and
too
far
away
from
things
it
puts
too
much
power
in
too
few
hands
heretofore
we
men
up
here
have
had
recourse
to
our
courage
and

but
we
ll
have
to
unbuckle
them
both
when
the
law
comes
i
like

court
that

any
he
laid
hand
upon
his
hip
the
colt
s
may
go
but
the
courage
never
will
she
broke
in
perhaps
but
i
ve
heard
rumors
already
of
a
plot
to
prostitute
the
law
in
unalaska
a
man
warned
dextry
with
terror
in
his
eye
to
beware
of
it
that
beneath
the
cloak
of
justice
was
a
drawn
dagger
whetted
for
us
fellows
who
own
the
rich
diggings
i
don
t
think
there
s
any
truth
in
it
but
you
can
t
the
law
is
the
foundation
there
can
t
be
any
progress
without
it
there
is
nothing
here
now
but
there
isn
t
half
the
disorder
you
think
there
is
there
weren
t
any
crimes
in
this
country
till
the
arrived
we
didn
t
know
what
a
thief
was
if
you
came
to
a
cabin
you
walked
in
without
knocking
the
owner
filled
up
the
and
sliced
into
the
bacon
then
when
he
d
started
your
meal
he
shook
hands
and
asked
your
name
it
was
just
the
same
whether
his
cache
was
full
or
whether
he
d
packed
his
few
pounds
of
food
two
hundred
miles
on
his
back
that
was
hospitality
to
make
your
southern
article
look
pretty
small
if
there
was
no
one
at
home
you
ate
what
you
needed
there
was
but
one
unpardonable
breach
of
etiquette
to
fail
to
leave
dry
kindlings
i
m
afraid
of
the
transitory
stage
we
re
coming
to
that
epoch
of
chaos
between
the
death
of
the
old
and
the
birth
of
the
new
frankly
i
like
the
old
way
best
i
love
the
license
of
it
i
love
to
wrestle
with
nature
to
snatch
and
guard
and
fight
for
what
i
have
i
ve
been
beyond
the
law
for
years
and
i
want
to
stay
there
where
life
is
just
what
it
was
intended
to
be
a
survival
of
the
his
large
hands
as
he
gripped
the
bulwark
were
tense
and
corded
while
his
rich
voice
issued
softly
from
his
chest
with
the
hint
of
power
unlimited
behind
it
he
stood
over
her
tall
virile
and
magnetic
she
saw
now
why
he
had
so
joyously
hailed
the
fight
of
the
previous
night
to
one
of
his
kind
it
was
as
salt
air
to
the
nostrils
unconsciously
she
approached
him
drawn
by
the
spell
of
his
strength
my
pleasures
are
violent
and
my
hate
is
mighty
bitter
in
my
mouth
what
i
want
i
take
that
s
been
my
way
in
the
old
life
and
i
m
too
selfish
to
give
it
he
was
gazing
out
upon
the
dimly
lucent
miles
of
ice
but
now
he
turned
towards
her
and
doing
so
touched
her
warm
hand
next
his
on
the
rail
she
was
staring
up
at
him
unaffectedly
so
close
that
the
faint
odor
from
her
hair
reached
him
her
expression
was
simply
one
of
wonder
and
curiosity
at
this
type
so
different
from
any
she
had
known
but
the
man
s
eyes
were
hot
and
blinded
with
the
sight
of
her
and
he
felt
only
her
beauty
heightened
in
the
dim
light
the
brush
of
her
garments
and
the
small
soft
hand
beneath
his
the
thrill
from
the
touch
of
it
surged
over
him
mastered
him
what
i
want
i
take
he
repeated
and
then
suddenly
he
reached
forth
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
crushed
her
to
him
kissing
her
softly
fiercely
full
upon
the
lips
for
an
instant
she
lay
gasping
and
stunned
against
his
breast
then
she
tore
her
fist
free
and
with
all
her
force
struck
him
full
in
the
face
it
was
as
though
she
beat
upon
a
stone
with
one
movement
he
forced
her
arm
to
her
side
smiling
into
her
terrified
eyes
then
holding
her
like
iron
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
upon
the
mouth
the
eyes
the
hair
and
released
her
i
am
going
to
love
you
helen
said
he
and
may
god
strike
me
dead
if
i
ever
stop
you
she
cried
her
voice
coming
thick
and
hoarse
with
passion
turning
she
walked
proudly
forward
towards
her
cabin
a
trim
straight
haughty
figure
and
he
did
not
know
that
her
knees
were
shaking
and
weak
chapter
iv
the
killing
for
four
days
the
felt
blindly
through
the
white
fields
drifting
north
with
the
spring
tide
that
sets
through
behring
strait
till
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
open
water
showed
to
the
east
creeping
through
she
broke
out
into
the
last
stage
of
the
long
race
amid
the
cheers
of
her
weary
passengers
and
the
dull
jar
of
her
engines
made
welcome
music
to
the
girl
in
the
deck
soon
they
picked
up
a
mountainous
coast
which
rose
steadily
into
majestic
barren
ranges
still
white
with
the
melting
snows
and
at
ten
in
the
evening
under
a
golden
sunset
amid
screaming
whistles
they
anchored
in
the
roadstead
of
nome
before
the
rumble
of
her
chains
had
ceased
or
the
echo
from
the
fleet
s
salute
had
died
from
the
shoreward
hills
the
ship
was
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
tiny
craft
clamoring
about
her
iron
sides
while
an
officer
in
cap
and
gilt
climbed
the
bridge
and
greeted
captain
stephens
tugs
with
trailing
lighters
circled
discreetly
about
awaiting
the
completion
of
certain
formalities
these
over
the
uniformed
gentleman
dropped
back
into
his
skiff
and
rowed
away
a
clean
bill
of
health
captain
he
shouted
saluting
the
commander
thank
ye
sir
roared
the
sailor
and
with
that
the
swarmed
inward
boarding
the
steamer
from
all
quarters
as
the
master
turned
he
looked
down
from
his
bridge
to
the
deck
below
full
into
the
face
of
dextry
who
had
been
an
intent
witness
of
the
meeting
with
unbending
dignity
captain
stephens
let
his
left
eyelid
droop
slowly
while
a
boyish
grin
spread
widely
over
his
face
simultaneously
orders
rang
sharp
and
fast
from
the
bridge
the
crew
broke
into
feverish
life
the
creak
of
booms
and
the
clank
of
arose
we
re
here
miss
stowaway
said
glenister
entering
the
girl
s
cabin
the
inspector
passed
us
and
it
s
time
for
you
to
see
the
magic
city
come
it
s
a
wonderful
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
been
alone
since
the
scene
on
the
for
besides
ignoring
glenister
she
had
managed
that
he
should
not
even
see
her
except
in
dextry
s
presence
although
he
had
ever
since
been
courteous
and
considerate
she
felt
the
leaping
emotions
that
were
hidden
within
him
and
longed
to
leave
the
ship
to
fly
from
the
spell
of
his
personality
thoughts
of
him
made
her
writhe
and
yet
when
he
was
near
she
could
not
hate
him
as
she
willed
he
overpowered
her
he
would
not
be
hated
he
paid
no
heed
to
her
slights
this
very
quality
reminded
her
how
willingly
and
unquestioningly
he
had
fought
off
the
sailors
from
the
at
a
word
from
her
she
knew
he
would
do
so
again
and
more
and
it
is
hard
to
be
bitter
to
one
who
would
lay
down
his
life
for
you
even
though
he
has
offended
particularly
when
he
has
the
magnetism
that
sweeps
you
away
from
your
moorings
there
s
no
danger
of
being
seen
he
continued
the
crowd
s
crazy
and
besides
we
ll
go
ashore
right
away
you
must
be
mad
with
the
confinement
it
s
on
my
nerves
as
they
stepped
outside
the
door
of
an
adjacent
cabin
opened
framing
an
angular
woman
who
catching
sight
of
the
girl
emerging
from
glenister
s
paused
with
shrewdly
narrowed
eyes
flashing
quick
malicious
glances
from
one
to
the
other
they
came
later
to
remember
with
regret
this
chance
encounter
for
it
was
fraught
with
grave
results
for
them
both
glenister
the
lady
said
with
acid
cordiality
howdy
champian
he
moved
away
she
followed
a
step
staring
at
helen
are
you
going
ashore
or
wait
for
morning
don
t
know
yet
i
m
then
aside
to
the
girl
he
muttered
shake

s

on
who

asked
miss
chester
a
moment
later
her
husband

one
of
the

companies
she
s
an
old
gaining
her
first
view
of
the
land
the
girl
cried
out
sharply
they
rode
on
an
oily
sea
tinted
like
burnished
copper
while
on
all
sides
amid
the
faint
rattle
and
rumble
of
machinery
scores
of
ships
were
belching
cargoes
out
upon
living
swarms
of
scows
tugs
and
dories
here
and
there
eskimo
oomiaks
fat
boats
slid
about
like
huge
an
endless
stream
of
tenders
piled
high
with
freight
plied
to
and
from
the
shore
a
mile
distant
lay
the
city
stretched
like
a
white
ribbon
between
the
gold
of
the
ocean
sand
and
the
dun
of
the
tundra
it
was
like
no
other
in
the
world
at
first
glance
it
seemed
all
made
of
new
white
canvas
in
a
week
its
population
had
swelled
from
three
to
thirty
thousand
it
now
wandered
in
a
slender
sinuous
line
along
the
coast
for
miles
because
only
the
beach
afforded
dry
camping
ground
mounting
to
the
bank
behind
one
sank
in
moss
and
water
and
treading
twice
in
the
same
tracks
found
a
bog
of
oozing
icy
mud
therefore
as
the
town
doubled
daily
in
size
it
grew
endwise
like
a
string
of
dominoes
till
the
shore
from
cape
nome
to
penny
river
was
a
long
reach
of
white
glinting
in
the
low
rays
of
the
arctic
sunset
like
foamy
breakers
on
a
tropic
island
that

anvil
creek
up
yonder
said
glenister
there

where
the
midas
lies

indicated
a
gap
in
the
buttress
of
mountains
rolling
back
from
the
coast

the
greatest
creek

the

see

oh

securing
a
small
boat
they
were
rowed
ashore
the
partners
plying
their
ferryman
with
eager
questions
having
arrived
five
days
before
he
was
exploding
with
information
and
volunteered
the
fruits
of
his
ripe
experience
till
dextry
stated
that
they
were
sourdoughs
themselves
and
owned
the
midas
whereupon
miss
chester
marvelled
at
the
awe
which
sat
upon
the
man
and
the
wondering
stare
with
which
he
devoured
the
partners
to
her
own
utter
exclusion
sufferin
cats
look
at
the
freight
ejaculated
dextry
if
a
storm
come
up
it
would
bust
the
community
the
beach
they
neared
was
walled
and
crowded
to
the
mark
with
ramparts
of
merchandise
while
every
incoming
craft
deposited
its
quota
upon
whatever
vacant
foot
was
close
at
hand
till
bales
boxes
boilers
and
baggage
of
all
kinds
were
confusedly
intermixed
in
the
narrow
space
singing
longshoremen
trundled
burdens
from
the
lighters
and
piled
them
on
the
heap
while
yelling
cursing
crowds
fought
over
it
all
selecting
sorting
loading
there
was
no
room
for
more
yet
hourly
they
added
to
the
mass
teams
splashed
through
the
lapping
surf
or
stuck
in
the
deep
sand
between
hillocks
of
goods
all
was
noise
profanity
congestion
and
feverish
hurry
this
burning
haste
rang
in
the
voice
of
the
multitude
showed
in
its
violence
of
gesture
and
redness
of
face
permeated
the
atmosphere
with
a
magnetic
electrifying
energy

colloquially

dextry
i

he
s
a

all
three
men
nodded
sagely
and
the
girl
wished
for
further
light
but
they
volunteered
no
explanation
leaving
the
skiff
they
plunged
into
turmoil
dodging
through
the
tangle
they
came
out
into
fenced
lots
where
tents
stood
wall
to
wall
and
every
inch
was
occupied
here
and
there
was
a
vacant
spot
guarded
jealously
by
its
owner
who
gazed
sourly
upon
all
men
with
the
forbidding
eye
of
suspicion
finding
an
eddy
in
the
confusion
the
men
stopped
where
do
you
want
to
go
they
asked
miss
chester
there
was
no
longer
in
glenister
s
glance
that
freedom
with
which
he
had
come
to
regard
the
women
of
the
north
he
had
come
to
realize
dully
that
here
was
a
girl
driven
by
some
strong
purpose
into
a
position
repellent
to
her
in
a
man
of
his
type
her
independence
awoke
only
admiration
and
her
coldness
served
but
to
inflame
him
the
more
delicacy
in
glenister
was
lost
in
a
remarkable
singleness
of
purpose
he
could
laugh
at
her
loathing
smile
under
her
abuse
and
remain
utterly
ignorant
that
anything
more
than
his
action
in
seizing
her
that
night
lay
at
the
bottom
of
her
dislike
he
did
not
dream
that
he
possessed
characteristics
abhorrent
to
her
and
he
felt
a
keen
reluctance
at
parting
she
extended
both
hands
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
for
what
you
have
done
you
two
but
i
shall
try
dextry
gazed
doubtfully
at
his
own
hand
rough
and
gnarly
then
taking
hers
as
he
would
have
handled
a
robin
s
egg
waggled
it
limply

assured
him

and
we

out
to
the
they
pushed
through
the
tangle
of
tents
past
piles
of
lumber
and
emerged
upon
the
main
thoroughfare
which
ran
parallel
to
the
shore
nome
consisted
of
one
narrow
street
twisted
between
solid
rows
of
canvas
and
frame
buildings
its
every
other
door
that
of
a
saloon
there
were
blocks
which
aspired
to
the
dizzy
height
of
three
stories
some
sheathed
in
corrugated
iron
others
gleaming
and
galvanized
lawyers
signs
doctors
surveyors
were
in
the
upper
windows
the
street
was
thronged
with
men
from
every
land
helen
chester
heard
more
dialects
than
she
could
count
laplanders
in
quaint
padded
caps
idled
past
men
with
the
tan
of
the
tropics
rubbed
elbows
with
norsemen
and
near
her
a
carefully
groomed
frenchman
with
and
monocle
was
in
pantomime
with
a
eskimo
to
her
left
was
the
sparkling
sea
alive
with
ships
of
every
class
to
her
right
towered
timberless
mountains
unpeopled
unexplored
forbidding
and
desolate
their
hollows
inlaid
with
snow
on
one
hand
were
the
life
and
the
world
she
knew
on
the
other
silence
mystery
possible
adventure
the
roadway
where
she
stood
was
a
crush
of
sundry
vehicles
from
bicycles
to
and
on
all
sides
men
were
laboring
busily
the
echo
of
hammers
mingling
with
the
cries
of
teamsters
and
the
tinkle
of
music
within
the
saloons
and
this
is
midnight
exclaimed
helen
breathlessly
do
they
ever
rest
there
isn

time
this
is
a
gold
stampede
you
haven
t
caught
the
spirit
of
it
they
climbed
the
stairs
in
a
huge
building
to
the
office
of
dunham
struve
and
in
answer
to
their
knock
a
tousled
man
in
and
opened
the
door
what
d
ye
wan
he
bawled
his
legs
wavering
uncertainly
his
eyes
were
heavy
and
bloodshot
his
lips
loose
and
his
whole
person
exhaled
alcoholic
fumes
like
a
gust
from
a
hanging
to
the
knob
he
strove
vainly
to
solve
the
mystery
of
his
suspenders

glenister

the
lawyer
replied
there
was
neither
curiosity
recognition
nor
resentment
in
his
voice
in
fact
his
head
drooped
so
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
girl
who
had
shrunk
back
at
sight
of
him
he
was
a
young
man
with
marks
of
brilliancy
showing
through
the
dissipation
betrayed
by
his
silvery
hair
and
coarsened
features
oh
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
lamented
the
girl

brave
what

i
do
for
you
he
made
to
cross
the
threshold
hospitably
but
tripped
plunged
forward
and
would
have
rolled
down
the
stairs
had
not
glenister
gathered
him
up
and
borne
him
back
into
the
office
where
he
tossed
him
upon
a
bed
in
a
rear
room
now
what
miss
chester
asked
the
young
man
returning
isn
t
that
dreadful
she
shuddered
oh
and
i
must
see
him
she
stamped
impatiently
i
must
see
him
no
you
mustn
t
said
glenister
with
equal
decision
in
the
first
place
he
wouldn
t
know
what
you
were
talking
about
and
in
the
second
place
i
know
struve
he
s
too
drunk
to
talk
business
and
too
sober
to
well
to
see
you
but
i
see
him
she
insisted
it
s
what
brought
me
here
you
don
t
i
understand
more
than
he
could
he
s
in
no
condition
to
act
on
any
important
matter
you
come
around
when
he
s
it
means
so
much
breathed
the
girl
the
beast
glenister
noted
that
she
had
not
wrung
her
hands
nor
even
hinted
at
tears
though
plainly
her
disappointment
and
anxiety
were
consuming
her
well
i
suppose
i
ll
have
to
wait
but
i
don
t
know
where
to
go
some
hotel
i
there
aren
t
any
they
re
building
two
but
you
couldn
t
hire
a
room
in
nome
for
money
i
was
about
to
say
love
or
have
you
no
other
friends
here
no
women
then
you
must
let
me
find
a
place
for
you
i
have
a
friend
whose
wife
will
take
you
she
rebelled
at
this
was
she
never
to
have
done
with
this
man
s
favors
she
thought
of
returning
to
the
ship
but
dismissed
that
she
undertook
to
decline
his
aid
but
he
was
down
the
stairs
and
paid
no
attention
to
her
beginning
so
she
followed
him
it
was
then
that
helen
chester
witnessed
her
first
tragedy
of
the
frontier
and
through
it
came
to
know
better
the
man
whom
she
disliked
and
with
whom
she
had
been
thrown
so
fatefully
already
she
had
thrilled
at
the
spell
of
this
country
but
she
had
not
learned
that
strength
and
license
carry
blood
and
violence
as
corollaries
emerging
from
the
doorway
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
they
drifted
slowly
along
the
walk
watching
the
crowd
besides
the
universal
tension
there
were
laughter
and
hope
and
exhilaration
in
the
faces
the
enthusiasm
of
this
boyish
multitude
warmed
one
the
girl
wished
to
get
into
this
spirit
to
be
one
of
them
then
suddenly
from
the
babble
at
their
elbows
came
a
discordant
note
not
long
nor
loud
only
a
few
words
penetrating
and
harsh
with
the
metallic
quality
lent
by
passion
helen
glanced
over
her
shoulder
to
find
that
the
smiles
of
the
throng
were
gone
and
that
its
eyes
were
bent
on
some
scene
in
the
street
with
an
eager
interest
she
had
never
seen
mirrored
before
simultaneously
glenister
spoke
come
away
from
with
the
quickened
eye
of
experience
he
foresaw
trouble
and
tried
to
drag
her
on
but
she
shook
off
his
grasp
impatiently
and
turning
gazed
absorbed
at
the
spectacle
which
unfolded
itself
before
her
although
not
comprehending
the
play
of
events
she
felt
vaguely
the
quick
approach
of
some
crisis
yet
was
unprepared
for
the
swiftness
with
which
it
came
her
eyes
had
leaped
to
the
figures
of
two
men
in
the
street
from
whom
the
rest
had
separated
like
oil
from
water
one
was
slim
and
well
dressed
the
other
bulky
mackinawed
and
lowering
of
feature
it
was
the
smaller
who
spoke
and
for
a
moment
she
misjudged
his
bloodshot
eyes
and
swaying
carriage
to
be
the
result
of
alcohol
until
she
saw
that
he
was
racked
with
fury
make
good
i
tell
you
quick
give
me
that
bill
of
sale
you
the
unkempt
man
swung
on
his
heel
with
a
growl
and
walked
away
his
course
leading
him
towards
glenister
and
the
girl
with
two
strides
he
was
abreast
of
them
then
detecting
the
flashing
movement
of
the
other
he
whirled
like
a
wild
animal
his
voice
had
the
snarl
of
a
beast
in
it
ye
had
to
have
it
didn
t
ye
well
there
the
actions
of
both
men
were
quick
as
light
yet
to
the
girl
s
taut
senses
they
seemed
theatrical
and
deliberate
into
her
mind
was
seared
forever
the
memory
of
that
second
as
though
the
shutter
of
a
camera
had
snapped
impressing
upon
her
brain
the
scene
sharp
and
vivid
the
shaggy
back
of
the
large
man
almost
brushing
her
the
man
in
the
derby
hat
the
crowd
sweeping
backward
like
rushes
before
a
blast
men
with
arms
flexed
and
feet
raised
in
flight
the
glaring
yellow
sign
of
the
gold
belt
dance
hall
across
the
way
these
were
stamped
upon
her
retina
and
then
she
was
jerked
violently
backward
two
strong
arms
crushed
her
down
upon
her
knees
against
the
wall
and
she
was
smothered
in
the
arms
of
roy
glenister
my
god
don
t
move
we
re
in
line
he
crouched
over
her
his
cheek
against
her
hair
his
weight
forcing
her
down
into
the
smallest
compass
his
arms
about
her
his
body
forming
a
living
shield
against
the
flying
bullets
over
them
the
big
man
stood
and
the
sustained
roar
of
his
gun
was
deafening
in
an
instant
they
heard
the
thud
and
felt
the
jar
of
lead
in
the
thin
boards
against
which
they
huddled
again
the
report
echoed
above
their
heads
and
they
saw
the
slender
man
in
the
street
drop
his
weapon
and
spin
half
round
as
though
hit
with
some
heavy
hand
he
uttered
a
cry
and
stooping
for
his
gun
plunged
forward
burying
his
face
in
the
sand
the
man
by
glenister
s
side
shouted
curses
thickly
and
walked
towards
his
prostrate
enemy
firing
at
every
step
the
wounded
man
rolled
to
his
side
and
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
shot
twice
so
rapidly
that
the
reports
blended
but
without
checking
his
antagonist
s
approach
four
more
times
the
relentless
assailant
fired
deliberately
his
last
missile
sent
as
he
stood
over
the
body
which
twitched
and
shuddered
at
his
feet
its
garments
muddy
and
smeared
then
he
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
back
within
arm
of
the
two
who
pressed
against
the
building
he
came
and
as
he
went
by
they
saw
his
coarse
and
sullen
features
drawn
and
working
pallidly
while
the
breath
whistled
through
his
teeth
he
held
his
course
to
the
door
they
had
just
quitted
then
as
he
turned
he
coughed
bestially
spitting
out
a
mouthful
of
blood
his
knees
wavered
he
vanished
within
the
portals
and
in
the
sickly
silence
that
fell
they
heard
his
boots
clumping
slowly
up
the
stairs
noise
awoke
and
rioted
down
the
thoroughfare
men
rushed
forth
from
every
quarter
and
the
ghastly
object
in
the
dirt
was
hidden
by
a
seething
mass
of
miners
glenister
raised
the
girl
but
her
head
rolled
limply
and
she
would
have
slipped
to
her
knees
again
had
he
not
placed
his
arm
about
her
waist
her
eyes
were
staring
and
don
t
be
frightened
said
he
smiling
at
her
reassuringly
but
his
own
lips
shook
and
the
sweat
stood
out
like
dew
on
him
for
they
had
both
been
close
to
death
there
came
a
surge
and
swirl
through
the
crowd
and
dextry
swooped
upon
them
like
a
hawk
be
ye
hurt
holy
mackinaw
when
i
see
em
blaze
away
i
yells
at
ye
fit
to
bust
my
throat
i
shore
thought
you
was
gone
although
i
can
t
say
but
this
killin
was
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
so
neat
an
genteel
still
as
a
rule
in
these
street
brawls
it
s
the
innocuous
bystander
that
has
flowers
sent
around
to
his
house
look
at
this
said
glenister
in
the
wall
against
which
they
had
crouched
not
three
feet
apart
were
bullet
holes
them
s
the
first
two
he
unhitched
dextry
remarked
jerking
his
head
towards
the
object
in
the
street
must
have
been
a
new
gun
an
pulled
hard
throwed
him
to
the
right
see
even
to
the
girl
it
was
patent
that
had
she
not
been
snatched
as
she
was
the
bullet
would
have
found
her
come
away
quick
she
panted
and
they
led
her
into
a
store
where
she
sank
upon
a
seat
and
trembled
until
dextry
brought
her
a
glass
of
whiskey
here
miss
he
said
pretty
tough
go
for
a
i
m
afraid
you
ain
t
gettin
enamoured
of
this
here
country
a
whole
for
half
an
hour
he
talked
to
her
in
his
whimsical
way
of
foreign
things
till
she
was
quieted
then
the
partners
arose
to
go
although
glenister
had
arranged
for
her
to
stop
with
the
wife
of
the
merchant
for
the
rest
of
the
night
she
would
not
i
can
t
go
to
bed
please
don
t
leave
me
i
m
too
nervous
i
ll
go
if
you
do
the
strain
of
the
last
week
has
been
too
much
for
me
if
i
sleep
i
ll
see
the
faces
of
those
men
dextry
talked
with
his
companion
then
made
a
purchase
which
he
laid
at
the
lady
s
feet
here
s
a
pair
of
gum
boots
you
put
em
on
an
come
with
us
we
ll
take
your
mind
off
of
things
complete
an
as
fer
sweet
dreams
when
you
get
back
you
ll
make
the
slumbers
of
the
just
seem
as
restless
as
a
riot
or
the
antics
of
a
which
nimbly
leaps
from
crag
to
crag
and
well
that
s
restless
enough
come
on
as
the
sun
slanted
up
out
of
behring
sea
they
marched
back
towards
the
hills
their
feet
in
the
soft
fresh
moss
while
the
air
tasted
like
a
cool
draught
and
a
myriad
of
earthy
odors
rose
up
and
encircled
them
snipe
and
reed
birds
were
noisy
in
the
hollows
and
from
the
misty
tundra
lakes
came
the
honking
of
brant
after
their
weary
weeks
on
shipboard
the
dewy
freshness
livened
them
magically
cleansing
from
their
memories
the
recent
tragedy
so
that
the
girl
became
herself
again
where
are
we
going
she
asked
at
the
end
of
an
hour
pausing
for
breath
why
to
the
midas
of
course
they
said
and
one
of
them
vowed
recklessly
as
he
drank
in
the
beauty
of
her
clear
eyes
and
the
grace
of
her
slender
panting
form
that
he
would
gladly
give
his
share
of
all
its
riches
to
undo
what
he
had
done
one
night
on
the
chapter
v
wherein
a
man
appears
in
the
lives
of
countries
there
are
crises
where
for
a
breath
destinies
lie
in
the
laps
of
the
gods
and
are
jumbled
heads
or
tails
thus
are
marked
distinctive
cycles
like
the
seven
ages
of
a
man
and
though
perhaps
they
are
too
subtle
to
be
perceived
at
the
time
yet
having
swung
past
the
shadowy
milestones
the
epochs
disclose
themselves
such
a
period
in
the
progress
of
the
far
northwest
was
the
nineteenth
day
of
july
although
to
those
concerned
in
the
building
of
this
new
empire
the
day
appealed
only
as
the
date
of
the
coming
of
the
law
all
nome
gathered
on
the
sands
as
lighters
brought
ashore
judge
stillman
and
his
following
it
was
held
fitting
that
the
should
be
the
ship
to
safeguard
the
dignity
of
the
first
court
and
to
introduce
justice
into
this
land
of
the
wild
the
interest
awakened
by
his
honor
was
augmented
by
the
fact
that
he
was
met
on
the
beach
by
a
charming
girl
who
flung
herself
upon
him
with
evident
delight
that
s
his
niece
said
some
one
she
came
up
on
the
first
boat
name
s
chester
swell
looker
eh
another
attracted
even
more
notice
than
the
limb
of
the
law
a
gigantic
man
with
keen
eyes
and
that
indefinable
easy
movement
and
polished
bearing
that
come
from
confidence
health
and
travel
unlike
the
others
he
did
not
dally
on
the
beach
nor
display
much
interest
in
his
surroundings
but
with
purposeful
frown
strode
through
the
press
up
into
the
heart
of
the
city
his
companion
was
struve
s
partner
dunham
a
pompous
man
they
went
directly
to
the
offices
of
dunham
struve
where
they
found
the
junior
partner
mighty
glad
to
meet
you
mcnamara
said
struve
your
name
is
a
household
word
in
my
part
of
the
country
my
people
were
mixed
up
in
dakota
politics
somewhat
so
i
ve
always
had
a
great
admiration
for
you
and
i
m
glad
you
ve
come
to
alaska
this
is
a
big
country
and
we
need
big
did
you
have
any
trouble
dunham
inquired
when
the
three
had
adjourned
to
a
private
room
trouble
said
struve
ruefully
well
i
wonder
if
i
did
miss
chester
brought
me
your
instructions
and
i
got
busy
right
off
but
tell
me
this
how
did
you
get
the
girl
to
act
as
messenger
there
was
no
one
else
to
send
answered
mcnamara
dunham
intended
sailing
on
the
first
boat
but
he
was
detained
in
washington
with
me
and
the
judge
had
to
wait
for
us
at
seattle
we
were
afraid
to
trust
a
stranger
for
fear
he
might
get
curious
and
examine
the
papers
that
would
have
meant
he
moved
his
hand
eloquently
struve
nodded
i
see
does
she
know
what
was
in
the
documents
decidedly
not
women
and
business
don
t
mix
i
hope
you
didn
t
tell
her
no
i
haven
t
had
a
chance
she
seemed
to
take
a
dislike
to
me
for
some
reason
i
haven
t
seen
her
since
the
day
after
she
got
the
judge
told
her
it
had
something
to
do
with
preparing
the
way
for
his
court
said
dunham
and
that
if
the
papers
were
not
delivered
before
he
arrived
it
might
cause
a
lot
of
trouble
litigation
riots
bloodshed
and
all
that
he
filled
her
up
on
generalities
till
the
girl
was
frightened
to
death
and
thought
the
safety
of
her
uncle
and
the
whole
country
depended
on
well
continued
struve
it
s
dead
easy
to
hire
men
to
jump
claims
and
it
s
dead
easy
to
buy
their
rights
afterwards
particularly
when
they
know
they
haven
t
got
any
but
what
course
do
you
follow
when
owners
go
gunning
for
you
mcnamara
laughed
who
did
that
a
benevolent
old
texan
pirate
by
the
name
of
dextry
he
s
one
half
owner
in
the
midas
and
the
other
half
as
peaceable
you
d
imagine
as
a
benediction
but
with
the
temperament
of
a
geronimo
i
sent
galloway
out
to
relocate
the
claim
and
he
got
his
notices
up
in
the
night
when
they
were
asleep
but
at
he
came
flying
back
to
my
room
and
nearly
hammered
the
door
down
i
ve
seen
fright
in
varied
forms
and
phases
but
he
had
them
all
with
some
added
starters
hide
me
out
quick
he
panted
what
s
up
i
asked
i
ve
stirred
up
a
breakfast
of
grizzly
bear
and
sudden
death
and
it
don
t
set
well
on
my
stummick
let
me
i
had
to
keep
him
hidden
three
days
for
this
old
cannibal
roamed
the
streets
with
a
cannon
in
his
hand
breathing
fire
and
anybody
else
act
up
queried
dunham
no
all
the
rest
are
swedes
and
they
haven
t
got
the
nerve
to
fight
they
couldn
t
lick
a
spoon
if
they
tried
these
other
men
are
different
though
there
are
two
of
them
the
old
one
and
a
young
fellow
i
m
a
little
afraid
to
mix
it
up
with
them
and
if
their
claim
wasn
t
the
best
in
the
district
i
d
say
let
it
i
ll
attend
to
that
said
mcnamara
struve
resumed
yes
gentlemen
i
ve
been
working
pretty
hard
and
also
pretty
much
in
the
dark
so
far
i
m
groping
for
light
when
miss
chester
brought
in
the
papers
i
got
busy
instanter
i
clouded
the
title
to
the
richest
placers
in
the
region
but
i
m
blamed
if
i
quite
see
the
use
of
it
we
d
be
thrown
out
of
any
court
in
the
land
if
we
took
them
to
law
what
s
the
game
blackmail
humph
ejaculated
mcnamara
what
do
you
take
me
for
well
it
does
seem
small
for
alec
mcnamara
but
i
can
t
see
what
else
you
re
up
within
a
week
i
ll
be
running
every
good
mine
in
the
nome
mcnamara
s
voice
was
calm
but
decisive
his
glance
keen
and
alert
while
about
him
clung
such
a
breath
of
power
and
confidence
that
it
compelled
belief
even
in
the
face
of
this
astounding
speech
in
spite
of
himself
wilton
struve
lawyer
rake
and
gentlemanly
adventurer
felt
his
heart
leap
at
what
the
other
s
daring
implied
the
proposition
was
utterly
past
belief
and
yet
looking
into
the
man
s
purposeful
eyes
he
believed
that
s
big
awful
big
big
the
younger
man
murmured
why
man
it
means
you
ll
handle
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
day
dunham
shifted
his
feet
in
the
silence
and
licked
his
dry
lips
of
course
it
s
big
but
mcnamara
s
the
biggest
man
that
ever
came
to
alaska
he
said
and
i
ve
got
the
biggest
scheme
that
ever
came
north
backed
by
the
biggest
men
in
washington
continued
the
politician
look
here
he
displayed
a
sheet
bearing
parallel
lists
of
names
and
figures
struve
gasped
incredulously
those
are
my
stockholders
and
that
is
their
share
in
the
venture
oh
yes
we
re
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
arizona
secret
of
course
it
would
never
do
for
the
names
to
get
out
i
m
showing
you
this
only
because
i
want
you
to
be
satisfied
who
s
behind
lord
i
m
satisfied
said
struve
laughing
nervously
dunham
was
with
you
when
you
figured
the
scheme
out
and
he
met
some
of
your
friends
in
washington
and
new
york
if
he
says
it
s
all
right
that
settles
it
but
say
suppose
anything
went
wrong
with
the
company
and
it
leaked
out
who
those
stockholders
are
there
s
no
danger
i
have
the
books
where
they
will
be
burned
at
the
first
sign
we
d
have
had
our
own
land
laws
passed
but
for
sturtevant
of
nevada
damn
him
he
blocked
us
in
the
senate
however
my
plan
is
he
rapidly
outlined
his
proposition
to
the
listeners
while
a
light
of
admiration
grew
and
shone
in
the
reckless
face
of
struve
by
heavens
you
re
a
wonder
he
cried
at
the
close
and
i
m
with
you
body
and
soul
it
s
dangerous
that
s
why
i
like
dangerous
mcnamara
shrugged
his
shoulders
bah
where
is
the
danger
we
ve
got
the
law
or
rather
we
the
law
now
let
s
get
to
it
seemed
that
the
boss
of
north
dakota
was
no
sluggard
he
discarded
coat
and
waistcoat
and
tackled
the
documents
which
struve
laid
before
him
going
through
them
like
a
whirlwind
gradually
he
infected
the
others
with
his
energy
and
soon
behind
the
locked
doors
of
dunham
struve
there
were
only
haste
and
fever
and
plot
and
intrigue
as
helen
chester
led
the
judge
towards
the
flamboyant
hotel
she
prattled
to
him
the
fascination
of
a
new
land
already
held
her
fast
and
now
she
felt
in
addition
security
and
relief
glenister
saw
them
from
a
distance
and
strode
forward
to
greet
them
he
beheld
a
man
of
perhaps
threescore
years
benign
of
aspect
save
for
the
eyes
which
were
neither
clear
nor
steady
but
had
the
trick
of
looking
past
one
glenister
thought
the
mouth
too
rather
weak
and
vacillating
but
the
face
was
dignified
by
learning
and
acumen
and
was
wrinkled
in
pleasant
fashion
my
niece
has
just
told
me
of
your
service
to
her
the
old
gentleman
began
i
am
happy
to
know
you
besides
being
a
brave
knight
and
assisting
ladies
in
distress
glenister
is
a
very
great
and
wonderful
man
helen
explained
lightly
he
owns
the
indeed
said
the
old
man
his
shifting
eyes
now
resting
full
on
the
other
with
a
flash
of
unmistakable
interest
i
hear
that
is
a
wonderful
mine
have
you
begun
work
yet
no
we
ll
commence
sluicing
day
after
it
has
been
a
late
spring
the
snow
in
the
gulch
was
deep
and
the
ground
thaws
slowly
we
ve
been
building
houses
and
doing
dead
work
but
we
ve
got
our
men
on
the
ground
i
am
greatly
interested
won
t
you
walk
with
us
to
the
hotel
i
want
to
hear
more
about
these
wonderful
well
they
great
placers
said
the
miner
as
the
three
walked
on
together
nobody
knows
great
because
we
ve
only
scratched
at
them
yet
in
the
first
place
the
ground
is
so
shallow
and
the
gold
is
so
easy
to
get
that
if
nature
didn
t
safeguard
us
in
the
winter
we
d
never
dare
leave
our
claims
for
fear
of
they
d
run
in
and
rob
how
much
will
the
anvil
creek
mines
produce
this
summer
asked
the
judge
it
s
hard
to
tell
sir
but
we
expect
to
average
five
thousand
a
day
from
the
midas
alone
and
there
are
other
claims
just
as
your
title
is
all
clear
i
dare
say
eh
absolutely
except
for
one
jumper
and
we
don
t
take
him
seriously
a
fellow
named
galloway
relocated
us
one
night
last
month
but
he
didn
t
allege
any
grounds
for
doing
so
and
we
could
never
find
trace
of
him
if
we
had
our
title
would
be
as
clean
as
snow
he
said
the
last
with
a
peculiar
inflection
you
wouldn
t
use
violence
i
trust
sure
why
not
it
has
worked
all
right
but
my
dear
sir
those
days
are
gone
the
law
is
here
and
it
is
the
duty
of
every
one
to
abide
by
well
perhaps
it
is
but
in
this
country
we
consider
a
man
s
mine
as
sacred
as
his
family
we
didn
t
know
what
a
lock
and
key
were
in
the
early
times
and
we
didn
t
have
any
troubles
except
famine
and
hardship
it
s
different
now
though
why
there
have
been
more
claims
jumped
around
here
this
spring
than
in
the
whole
length
and
history
of
the
they
had
reached
the
hotel
and
glenister
paused
turning
to
the
girl
as
the
judge
entered
when
she
started
to
follow
he
detained
her
i
came
down
from
the
hills
on
purpose
to
see
you
it
has
been
a
long
week
don
t
talk
that
way
she
interrupted
coldly
i
don
t
care
to
hear
see
here
what
makes
you
shut
me
out
and
wrap
yourself
up
in
your
haughtiness
i
m
sorry
for
what
i
did
that
night
i
ve
told
you
so
repeatedly
i
ve
wrung
my
soul
for
that
act
till
there
s
nothing
left
but
it
is
not
that
she
said
slowly
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
during
the
past
month
and
now
that
i
have
gained
an
insight
into
this
life
i
see
that
it
wasn
t
an
unnatural
thing
for
you
to
do
it
s
terrible
to
think
of
but
it
s
true
i
don
t
mean
that
it
was
pardonable
she
continued
quickly
for
it
wasn
t
and
i
hate
you
when
i
think
about
it
but
i
suppose
i
put
myself
into
a
position
to
invite
such
actions
no
i
m
sufficiently
not
to
blame
you
unreasonably
and
i
think
i
could
like
you
in
spite
of
it
just
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
but
that
isn
t
all
there
is
something
deeper
you
saved
my
life
and
i
m
grateful
but
you
frighten
me
always
it
is
the
cruelty
in
your
strength
it
is
something
away
back
in
you
lustful
and
ferocious
and
wild
and
he
smiled
wryly
it
is
my
local
color
maybe
absorbed
from
this
country
i
ll
try
to
change
though
if
you
want
me
to
i
ll
let
them
rope
and
throw
and
brand
me
i
ll
take
on
the
graces
of
civilization
and
put
away
revenge
and
ambition
and
all
the
rest
of
it
if
it
will
make
you
like
me
any
better
why
i
ll
even
promise
not
to
violate
the
person
of
our
if
i
catch
him
and
heaven
knows
means
that
samson
has
parted
with
his
i
think
i
could
like
you
if
you
did
she
said
but
you
can
t
do
it
you
are
a
there
are
no
clubs
nor
marts
where
men
foregather
for
business
in
the
north
nothing
but
the
saloon
and
this
is
all
and
more
than
a
club
here
men
congregate
to
drink
to
gamble
and
to
traffic
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
glenister
entered
the
northern
and
passed
idly
down
the
row
of
games
pausing
at
the
where
he
rolled
the
dice
when
his
turn
came
moving
to
the
he
lost
a
stack
of
whites
but
at
the
faro
his
luck
was
better
and
he
won
a
gold
coin
on
the
whereupon
he
promptly
ordered
a
round
of
drinks
for
the
men
grouped
about
him
a
formality
always
precedent
to
overtures
of
general
friendship
as
he
paused
glass
in
hand
his
eyes
were
drawn
to
a
man
who
stood
close
by
talking
earnestly
the
aspect
of
the
stranger
challenged
notice
for
he
stood
high
above
his
companions
with
a
peculiar
grace
of
attitude
in
place
of
the
awkwardness
common
in
men
of
great
stature
among
those
who
were
listening
intently
to
the
man
s
carefully
modulated
tones
glenister
recognized
mexico
mullins
the
who
had
given
dextry
the
warning
at
unalaska
as
he
further
studied
the
listening
group
a
drunken
man
staggered
uncertainly
through
the
wide
doors
of
the
saloon
and
gaining
sight
of
the
tall
stranger
blinked
then
approached
him
speaking
with
a
loud
voice
well
if
tain
t
ole
alec
mcnamara
how
do
ye
ole
pirate
mcnamara
nodded
and
turned
his
back
coolly
upon
the
don
t
turn
your
dorsal
fin
to
me
i
wan
to
talk
to
mcnamara
continued
his
calm
discourse
till
he
received
a
vicious
whack
on
the
shoulder
then
he
turned
for
a
moment
to
interrupt
his
assailant
s
garrulous
profanity
don
t
bother
me
i
am
ye
won
talk
to
me
eh
well
i
m
goin
to
talk
to
see
i
guess
you
d
listen
if
i
told
these
people
all
i
know
about
you
turn
around
his
voice
was
menacing
and
attracted
general
notice
observing
this
mcnamara
addressed
him
his
words
dropping
clear
concise
and
cold
don
t
talk
to
me
you
are
a
drunken
nuisance
go
away
before
something
happens
to
again
he
turned
away
but
the
drunken
man
seized
and
whirled
him
about
repeating
his
abuse
encouraged
by
this
apparent
patience
your
pardon
for
an
instant
mcnamara
laid
a
large
white
and
manicured
hand
upon
the
flannel
sleeve
of
the
miner
and
gently
escorted
him
through
the
entrance
to
the
sidewalk
while
the
crowd
smiled
as
they
cleared
the
threshold
however
he
clenched
his
fist
without
a
word
and
raising
it
struck
the
sot
fully
and
cruelly
upon
the
jaw
his
victim
fell
silently
the
back
of
his
head
striking
the
boards
with
a
hollow
thump
then
without
even
observing
how
he
lay
mcnamara
the
saloon
and
took
up
his
conversation
where
he
had
been
interrupted
his
voice
was
as
evenly
regulated
as
his
movements
betraying
not
a
sign
of
anger
excitement
or
bravado
he
lit
a
cigarette
extracted
a
and
jotted
down
certain
memoranda
supplied
him
by
mexico
mullins
all
this
time
the
body
lay
across
the
threshold
without
a
sign
of
life
the
buzz
of
the
was
resumed
and
the
began
his
monotonous
routine
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
nonchalant
man
at
the
bar
but
the
unconscious
creature
outside
the
threshold
lay
unheeded
for
in
these
men
s
code
it
behooves
the
most
humane
to
practise
a
certain
aloofness
in
the
matter
of
private
brawls
having
completed
his
notes
mcnamara
shook
hands
gravely
with
his
companions
and
strode
out
through
the
door
past
the
bulk
that
sprawled
across
his
path
and
without
pause
or
glance
disappeared
a
dozen
willing
though
unsympathetic
hands
laid
the
drunkard
on
the
where
the
bartender
poured
pitcher
upon
pitcher
of
water
over
him
he
ain
t
hurt
none
to
speak
of
said
a
bystander
then
added
with
enthusiasm
but
say
there
s
a
in
this
here
camp
chapter
vi
and
a
mine
is
jumped
who
s
your
new
shift
boss
glenister
inquired
of
his
partner
a
few
days
later
indicating
a
man
in
the
cut
below
busied
in
setting
a
line
of
sluices
that
s
old
slapjack
simms
friend
of
mine
from
up
dawson
glenister
laughed
immoderately
for
the
object
was
unusually
tall
and
and
wore
a
soiled
suit
of
yellow
mackinaw
he
had
laid
off
his
coat
and
now
the
baggy
bilious
trousers
hung
precariously
from
his
angular
shoulders
by
suspenders
of
alarming
frailty
his
legs
were
lost
in
gum
boots
also
loose
and
cavernous
and
his
entire
costume
looked
relaxed
and
flapping
so
that
he
gave
the
impression
of
being
able
to
shake
himself
out
of
his
raiment
and
to
rise
like
a
burlesque
aphrodite
his
face
was
overgrown
with
a
grizzled
tangle
that
looked
as
though
it
had
been
trimmed
with
scissors
while
above
the
brush
heap
grandly
soared
a
shiny
head
has
he
always
been
bald
naw
he
ain
t
bald
at
all
he
shaves
his
nob
in
the
early
days
he
wore
a
long
flowin
mane
which
was
inhabited
by
crickets
and
such
fauna
it
got
to
be
a
hobby
with
him
finally
so
that
he
growed
superstitious
about
goin
uncurried
and
would
back
into
a
corner
with
both
guns
drawed
if
a
barber
came
near
him
but
once
hank
that
s
his
real
name
undertook
to
fry
some
slapjacks
and
in
givin
the
skillet
a
heave
the
dough
lit
among
his
forest
primeval
jest
back
of
his
ears
soft
side
down
hank
polluted
the
gulch
with
langwidge
which
no
man
had
ought
to
keep
in
himself
without
it
was
fumigated
disreppitableness
oozed
out
through
him
like
sweat
through
an
an
since
then
he
s
been
known
as
slapjack
simms
an
has
kept
his
head
shingled
smooth
as
a
gun
bar
l
he
s
a
good
miner
though
ain
t
none
better
an
square
as
a
sluicing
had
begun
on
the
midas
long
sinuous
lengths
of
canvas
hose
wound
down
the
creek
bottom
from
the
dam
like
gigantic
serpents
while
the
roll
of
gravel
through
the
flumes
mingled
musically
with
the
rush
of
waters
the
tinkle
of
tools
and
the
song
of
steel
on
rock
there
were
four
strings
of
boxes
abreast
and
the
heaving
line
of
shovellers
ate
rapidly
into
the
creek
bed
while
teams
with
scrapers
splashed
through
the
tail
races
in
an
atmosphere
of
softened
profanity
in
the
big
white
tents
which
sat
back
from
the
bluffs
fifty
men
of
the
night
shift
were
asleep
for
there
is
no
respite
here
no
night
no
sunday
no
halt
during
the
hundred
days
in
which
the
northland
lends
herself
to
pillage
the
mine
lay
cradled
between
wonderful
mossy
mountains
while
above
and
below
the
gulch
was
dotted
with
tents
and
huts
and
everywhere
from

great
contentment
filled
the
two

as
they
looked
on

to
wrest
from

her
richest
treasures
to

to

washed

watched

poked

while

two
miners
struggled
with
a
bowlder
they
had
unearthed
and
having
scraped
and
washed
it
carefully
staggered
back
to
place
it
on
the
cleaned
behind

of

and
it
crashed
against
a
brace
which
held
the
sluices
in

these
boxes
stand
more
than

above

resting
on

which

the

late
the
partners
saw
the
string
of
boxes
sway
and
bend
at
the
joint
then
before
they
could
reach
the
threatened
spot
to
support
it
slapjack
simms
with
a
shriek
plunged
flapping
down
into
the
cut
and
seized
the
flume
his
great
height
stood
him
in
good
stead
now
for
where
the
joint
had
opened
water
poured
forth
in
a
cataract
he
dived
under
the
breach
unhesitatingly
and
stooping
lifted
the
line
as
near
to
its
former
level
as
possible
holding
the
entire
burden
upon
his
naked
pate
he
gesticulated
wildly
for
help
while
over
him
poured
the
deluge
of
icy
muddy
water
it
entered
his
gaping
waistband
bulging
out
his
yellow
trousers
till
they
were
fat
and
full
and
the
seams
were
bursting
while
his
yawning
became
as
boiling
springs
meanwhile
he
chattered
forth
profanity
in
such
volume
that
the
ear
ached
under
it
as
must
have
ached
the
heroic
slapjack
under
the
chill
of
the
melting
snow
he
was
relieved
quickly
however
and
emerged
triumphant
though
blue
and
puckered
his
wilderness
of
whiskers
streaming
like
limber
stalactites
his
boots
loosely
squishing
while
oaths
still
poured
from
him
in
such
profusion
that
dextry
whispered

wonder
it
s
plumb
solemn
an
reverent
the
way
he
makes

a
privilege
to
be
present
that
s
a
that
you

some
dry
clothes
they
suggested
and

proceeded
a
few
paces
towards
the
tents
hobbling
as
though
treading
on
pounded
glass
ow
w
he
yelled
these
blasted
boots
is
full
of
he
seated
himself
and
tugged
at
his
foot
till
the
boot
came
away
with
a
sucking
sound
then
instead
of
emptying
the
accumulation
at
random
he
poured
the
contents
into
dextry
s
empty
rinsing
it
out
carefully
the
other
boot
he
emptied
likewise
they
held
a
surprising
amount
of
sediment
because
the
stream
that
had
emerged
from
the
crack
in
the
sluices
had
carried
with
it
pebbles
sand
and
all
the
concentration
of
the
riffles
at
this
point
standing
directly
beneath
the
cataract
most
of
it
had
dived
fairly
into

inviting
waistband

settled
it
in

and
washed
away
the
gravel
leaving
a
yellow
glittering
pile
which
raised
a
yell
from
the

had
lingered

he
loped
down
the
gulch
while
his
partner
returned
to
the
pit
the
flashing
shovel
blades
and
the
rumbling
undertone
of
the
big
workings
that
so
fascinated
him
it
was
perhaps
four
o
clock
when
he
was
aroused
from
his
labors
by
a
shout
from
the
where
a
group
of
horsemen
had
clustered
as
glenister
drew
near
he
saw
among
them
wilton
struve
the
lawyer
and
the
big
tenderfoot
of
the
northern
mcnamara
the
man
of
the
heavy
hand
struve
straightway
engaged
him
say
glenister
we
ve
come
out
to
see
about
the
title
to
this
what
about
it
well
it
was
relocated
about
a
month
he
paused
yes
what
of
that
galloway
has
commenced
the
ground
belongs
to
dextry
and
me
we
discovered
it
we
opened
it
up
we
ve
complied
with
the
law
and
we
re
going
to
hold
glenister
spoke
with
such
conviction
and
heat
as
to
nonplus
struve
but
mcnamara
who
had
sat
his
horse
silently
until
now
answered
certainly
sir
if
your
title
is
good
you
will
be
protected
but
the
law
has
arrived
in
alaska
and
we
ve
got
to
let
it
take
its
course
there
s
no
need
of
violence
none
whatever
but
briefly
the
situation
is
this
galloway
has
commenced
action
against
you
the
court
has
enjoined
you
from
working
and
has
appointed
me
as
receiver
to
operate
the
mine
until
the
suit
is
settled
it
s
an
extraordinary
procedure
of
course
but
the
conditions
are
extraordinary
in
this
country
the
season
is
so
short
that
it
would
be
unjust
to
the
rightful
owner
if
the
claim
lay
idle
all
summer
so
to
avoid
that
i
ve
been
put
in
charge
with
instructions
to
operate
it
and
preserve
the
proceeds
subject
to
the
court
s
order
voorhees
here
is
the
united
states
marshal
he
will
serve
the
glenister
threw
up
his
hand
in
a
gesture
of
restraint
hold
on
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
any
court
would
recognize
such
a
claim
as
galloway
s
the
law
recognizes
everything
if
his
grounds
are
no
good
so
much
the
better
for
you
can
t
put
in
a
receiver
without
notice
to
us
why
good
lord
we
never
heard
of
a
suit
being
commenced
we
ve
never
even
been
served
with
a
summons
and
we
haven
t
had
a
chance
to
argue
in
our
own
i
have
just
said
that
this
is
a
remarkable
state
of
affairs
and
unusual
action
had
to
be
taken
mcnamara
replied
but
the
young
miner
grew
excited
look
here
this
gold
won
t
get
away
it
s
safe
in
the
ground
we
ll
knock
off
work
and
let
the
claim
lie
idle
till
the
thing
is
settled
you
can
t
really
expect
us
to
surrender
possession
of
our
mine
on
the
mere
allegation
of
some
unknown
man
that
s
ridiculous
we
won
t
do
it
why
you
ll
have
to
let
us
argue
our
case
at
least
before
you
try
to
put
us
voorhees
shook
his
head
we
ll
have
to
follow
instructions
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
appear
before
the
court
and
have
the
receiver
dismissed
if
your
title
is
as
good
as
you
say
it
is
you
won
t
have
any
you
re
not
the
only
ones
to
suffer
added
mcnamara
we
ve
taken
possession
of
all
the
mines
below
he
nodded
down
the
gulch
i
m
an
officer
of
the
court
and
under
bond
how
much
five
thousand
dollars
for
each
what
why
heavens
man
the
poorest
of
these
mines
is
producing
that
much
every
day
while
he
spoke
glenister
was
rapidly
debating
what
course
to
follow
the
place
to
argue
this
thing
is
before
judge
stillman
said
struve
but
with
little
notion
of
the
conflict
going
on
within
glenister
the
youth
yearned
to
fight
not
with
words
nor
quibbles
nor
legal
phrases
but
with
steel
and
blows
and
he
felt
that
the
impulse
was
as
righteous
as
it
was
natural
for
he
knew
this
process
was
unjust
an
outrage
mexico
mullins
s
warning
recurred
to
him
and
yet
he
shifted
slowly
as
he
talked
till
his
back
was
to
the
door
of
the
big
tent
they
were
watching
him
carefully
for
all
their
apparent
languor
and
looseness
in
saddle
then
as
he
started
to
leap
within
and
rally
his
henchmen
his
mind
went
back
to
the
words
of
judge
stillman
and
his
niece
surely
that
old
man
was
on
the
square
he
couldn
t
be
otherwise
with
her
beside
him
believing
in
him
and
a
suspicion
of
deeper
plots
behind
these
actions
was
groundless
so
far
all
was
legal
he
supposed
with
his
scant
knowledge
of
law
though
the
methods
seemed
unreasonable
the
men
might
be
doing
what
they
thought
to
be
right
why
be
the
first
to
resist
the
men
on
the
mines
below
had
not
done
so
the
title
to
this
ground
was
capable
of
such
easy
proof
that
he
and
dex
need
have
no
uneasiness
courts
do
not
rob
honest
people
nowadays
he
argued
and
moreover
perhaps
the
girl
s
words
were
true
perhaps
she
think
more
of
him
if
he
gave
up
the
old
fighting
ways
for
her
sake
certainly
armed
resistance
to
her
uncle
s
first
edict
would
not
please
her
she
had
said
he
was
too
violent
so
he
would
show
her
he
could
lay
his
savagery
aside
she
might
smile
on
him
approvingly
and
that
was
worth
taking
a
chance
for
anyway
it
would
mean
but
a
few
days
delay
in
the
mine

run
as
he
reasoned
he
heard
a
low
voice
speaking
within

open
door

the

at

just
in

at

moved

into

at

his

the

flung

up

wrenched
the

from

cried
sharply
i

when
to
he
turned
to
look
into

in
the

of

unmoved

and

it
was
at
him

said

inhaled
deeply

with

and
looked
over

of

the

he
snorted

marched
past

and
his

down
to

put
on

and
vanished
down

it
grows
dark

approaches
so
that
the
many
lights
from

and

seem
less
garish
and
strange
than
they
do
a
month
earlier
in
the
northern
there
was
good
business
doing
the

which
had
cost
a

or

the

of

shone
rich
dark
and
enticing
while
the

glass
sparkled
with
iridescent
hues
reflecting
in
a
measure
the
prismatic
moods
the
dancing
spirits
of
the
crowd
that
crushed

halting
at
the

or
patronizing

building

inside

the
where
patrons
of
the

might
with
a
modicum
of
delay
and
inconvenience
quaff
as
deeply
of
the
beaker
as
of
the
ballet
now
however
the
show
had
closed
the
hall
had
been
cleared
of
chairs
and
canvas
exposing
a
glassy
tempting
surface
and
the
orchestra
had
moved
to
the
stage
they
played
a
rollicking
while
the
floor
swam
with
dancers
at
certain
intervals
the
musicians
worked
feverishly
up
to
a
crashing
crescendo
supported
by
the
voices
of
the
dancers
until
all
joined
at
the
top
note
in
a
yell
while
the
drummer
fired
a
colt
into
a
box
of
wet
sawdust
beside
his
chair
all
in
time
all
in
the
swinging
spirit
of
the
tune
the
men
who
were
mostly
young
danced
like
college
boys
while
the
women
who
were
all
young
and
good
dancers
floated
through
the
measures
with
the
ease
of
on
a
summer
stream
faces
were
flushed
eyes
were
bright
and
but
rarely
a
voice
sounded
that
was
not
glad
most
of
the
noise
came
from
the
men
and
although
one
caught
here
and
there
a
hint
of
haggard
lines
about
the
girlish
faces
and
glimpsed
occasional
eyes
that
did
not
smile
yet
as
a
whole
the
scene
was
one
of
genuine
enjoyment
suddenly
the
music
ceased
and
the
couples
crowded
to
the
bar
the
women
took
harmless
drinks
the
men
mostly
whiskey
rarely
was
the
choice
of
potations
criticised
though
occasionally
some
ruddy
eschewer
of
sobriety
insisted
that
his
lady
take
the
same
avowing
that
hootch
having
been
demonstrated
beneficial
in
his
case
was
good
for
her
also
invariably
the
lady
accepted
without
dispute
and
invariably
the
man
failed
to
note
her
glance
at
the
bartender
or
the
silent
substitution
by
that
capable
person
of
for
whiskey
or
of
plain
water
for
gin
in

the
mixers
collected
one
dollar
from

which
she
added
to

overhead

with

about

and
then
subterfuge
on
the

part
was

on

she
was
able
to
pocket
for
each
bottle
a
check
redeemable
at
five
dollars
a
stranger
straight
from
the
east
would
have
remarked
first
upon
the
good
music
next
upon
the
good
looks
of
the
women
and
then
upon
the
shabby
clothes
of
the

of

in

in

with
huge
initials
and

known
as
a
living
flame
among
women
he
had
dealt
the
biggest
games
of
the
early
days
and
had
no
enemies
yet
though
many
called
him
friend
they
wondered
inwardly
it
was
a
strong
play
the
kid
had
for
swede
sam
of
dawson
ventured
many
stacks
of
yellow
chips
and
he
was
a
quick
aggressive
gambler
a
jew
sat
at
the
king
end
with
ten
neatly
creased
bills
before
him
together
with
piles
of
smaller
currency
he
adventured
viciously
and
without
system
while
outsiders
to
the
number
of
four
or
five
cut
in
sporadically
with
small
bets
the
game
was
difficult
to
follow
consequently
the
lookout
from
his
raised
dais
was
leaning
forward
chin
in
hand
while
the
group
was
hedged
about
by
eager
faro
is
a
closed
book
to
most
people
for
its
intricacies
are
confusing
lucky
is
he
who
has
never
persevered
in
solving
its
mysteries
nor
speculated
upon
the
systems
of
beating
it
from
those
who
have
learned
it
the
game
demands
practice
dexterity
and
coolness
the
dealer
must
run
the
cards
watch
the
many
shifting
bets
handle
the
neatly
piled
checks
figure
the
profits
and
losses
it
was
his
unerring
clock
like
regularity
in
this
that
had
won
the
kid
his
reputation
this
night
his
powers
were
taxed
he
dealt
silently
scowlingly
his
long
white
fingers
nervously
caressing
the
cards
this
preoccupation
prevented
his
noticing
the
rustle
and
stir
of
a
who
had
crowded
up
behind
him
until
he
caught
the
wondering
glances
of
those
in
front
and
saw
that
the
israelite
was
staring
past
him
his
money
forgotten
his
eyes
beady
and
sharp
his
ratlike
teeth
showing
in
a
grin
of
admiration
swede
sam
glared
from
under
his
unkempt
shock
and
felt
uncertainly
towards
the
open
collar
of
his
flannel
shirt
where
a
kerchief
should
have
been
the
men
who
were
standing
gazed
at
the
some
with
surprise
others
with
a
half
smile
of
recognition
bronco
glanced
quickly
over
his
shoulder
and
as
he
did
so
the
breath
caught
in
his
throat
but
for
only
an
instant
a
girl
stood
so
close
beside
him
that
the
lace
of
her
gown
brushed
his
sleeve
he
was
shuffling
at
the
moment
and
dropped
a
card
then
nodded
to
her
speaking
quietly
as
he
stooped
to
regain
the
pasteboard
howdy
cherry
she
did
not
answer
only
continued
to
look
at
the
what
a
woman
he
thought
she
was
not
too
tall
with
smoothly
rounded
bust
and
hips
and
long
waist
all
well
displayed
by
her
perfectly
fitting
garments
her
face
was
oval
the
mouth
rather
large
the
eyes
of
dark
prominently
outlined
under
thin
silken
lids
her
hair
was
combed
low
over
the
ears
and
her
smile
showed
rows
of
sparkling
teeth
before
it
dived
into
twin
dimples
strangest
of
all
it
was
an
innocent
face
the
face
and
smile
of
a
the
kid
finished
his
shuffling
awkwardly
and
slid
the
cards
into
the
box
then
the
woman
spoke
let
me
have
your
place
the
men
gasped
the
jew
snickered
the
lookout
straightened
in
his
chair
better
not
it
s
a
hard
game
said
the
kid
but
her
voice
was
imperious
as
she
commanded
him
hurry
up
give
me
your
bronco
arose
whereupon
she
settled
in
his
chair
tucked
in
her
skirts
removed
her
gloves
and
twisted
into
place
the
diamonds
on
her
hands
what
the
devil
s
this
said
the
lookout
roughly
are
you
drunk
bronco
get
out
of
that
chair
she
turned
to
him
slowly
the
innocence
had
fled
from
her
features
and
the
big
eyes
flashed
warningly
a
change
had
coarsened
her
like
a
puff
of
air
on
a
still
pool
then
while
she
stared
at
him
her
lids
drooped
dangerously
and
her
lip
curled
throw
him
out
bronco
she
said
and
her
tones
held
the
hardness
of
a
mistress
to
her
slave
that
s
all
right
the
kid
reassured
the
lookout
she
s
a
better
dealer
than
i
am
this
is
cherry
without
noticing
the
stares
this
evoked
the
girl
commenced
her
hands
beautifully
soft
and
white
flashed
over
the
board
she
dealt
rapidly
unfalteringly
with
the
finish
of
one
bred
to
the
cards
handling
chips
and
coppers
with
the
peculiar
mannerisms
that
spring
from
long
practice
it
was
seen
that
she
never
looked
at
her
but
when
a
bet
required
paying
picked
up
a
stack
without
turning
her
head
and
they
saw
further
that
she
never
reached
twice
nor
took
a
large
pile
and
sized
it
up
against
its
mate
removing
the
extra
disks
as
is
the
custom
when
she
stretched
forth
her
hand
she
grasped
the
right
number
unerringly
this
is
considered
the
acme
of
professional
finish
and
the
bronco
kid
smiled
delightedly
as
he
saw
the
wonder
spread
from
the
lookout
to
the
spectators
and
heard
the
speech
of
the
men
who
stood
on
chairs
and
tables
for
sight
of
the
woman
dealer
for
twenty
minutes
she
continued
until
the
place
became
congested
and
never
once
did
the
lookout
detect
an
error
while
she
was
busy
glenister
entered
the
and
pushed
his
way
back
towards
the
theatre
he
was
worried
and
distrait
his
manner
perturbed
and
unnatural
silently
and
without
apparent
notice
he
passed
friends
who
greeted
him
what
ails
glenister
asked
a
he
acts
ain
t
you
heard
why
the
midas
has
been
jumped
he
s
in
a
bad
way
all
broke
the
girl
suddenly
ceased
without
finishing
the
deck
and
arose
don
t
stop
said
the
kid
while
a
murmur
of
dismay
came
from
the
spectators
she
only
shook
her
head
and
drew
on
her
gloves
with
a
show
of
ennui
gliding
through
the
crowd
she
threaded
about
aimlessly
the
recipient
of
many
stares
though
but
few
greetings
speaking
with
no
one
a
certain
dignity
serving
her
as
a
barrier
even
here
she
stopped
a
waiter
and
questioned
him
he
s
in
a
gallery
alone
yes
m
anyhow
he
was
a
minute
ago
unless
some
of
the
rustlers
has
broke
in
on
a
moment
later
glenister
watching
the
scene
below
was
aroused
from
his
gloomy
absorption
by
the
click
of
the
box
door
and
the
rustle
of
silken
skirts
go
out
please
he
said
without
turning
i
don
t
want
hearing
no
answer
he
began
again
i
came
here
to
be
alone
but
there
he
ceased
for
the
girl
had
come
forward
and
laid
her
two
hot
hands
upon
his
cheeks
boy
she
breathed
and
he
arose
swiftly
cherry
when
did
you
come
oh
ago
she
said
impatiently
from
dawson
they
told
me
you
had
struck
it
i
stood
it
as
long
as
i
could
then
i
came
to
you
now
tell
me
about
yourself
let
me
see
you
first
quick
she
pulled
him
towards
the
light
and
gazed
upward
devouring
him
hungrily
with
her
great
languorous
eyes
illustration
well
she
said
kiss
me
she
held
to
his
coat
lapels
standing
close
beside
him
her
warm
breath
beating
up
into
his
face
well
she
said
kiss
me
he
took
her
wrists
in
his
and
loosed
her
hold
then
looked
down
on
her
gravely
and
said
no
that
s
all
over
i
told
you
so
when
i
left
all
over
oh
no
it
isn
t
boy
you
think
so
but
it
isn
t
it
can
t
be
i
love
you
too
much
to
let
you
hush
said
he
there
are
people
in
the
next
i
don
t
care
let
them
hear
she
cried
with
feminine
recklessness
i
m
proud
of
my
love
for
you
i
ll
tell
it
to
them
to
the
whole
now
see
here
little
girl
he
said
quietly
we
had
a
long
talk
in
dawson
and
agreed
that
it
was
best
to
divide
our
ways
i
was
mad
over
you
once
as
a
good
many
other
men
have
been
but
i
came
to
my
senses
nothing
could
ever
result
from
it
and
i
told
you
yes
yes
i
know
i
thought
i
could
give
you
up
but
i
didn
t
realize
till
you
had
gone
how
i
wanted
you
oh
it
s
been
a
to
me
every
day
for
the
past
two
there
was
no
semblance
now
to
the
cold
creature
she
had
appeared
upon
entering
the
she
spoke
rapidly
her
whole
body
tense
with
emotion
her
voice
shaken
with
passion
i
ve
seen
men
and
men
and
men
and
they
ve
loved
me
but
i
never
cared
for
anybody
in
the
world
till
i
saw
you
they
ran
after
me
but
you
were
cold
you
made
me
come
to
you
perhaps
that
was
it
anyhow
i
can
t
stand
it
i
ll
give
up
everything
i
ll
do
anything
just
to
be
where
you
are
what
do
you
think
of
a
woman
who
will
beg
oh
i
ve
lost
my
pride
i
m
a
fool
a
fool
but
i
can
t
help
i
m
sorry
you
feel
this
way
said
glenister
it
isn
t
my
fault
and
it
isn
t
of
any
for
an
instant
she
stood
quivering
while
the
light
died
out
of
her
face
then
with
a
characteristic
change
she
smiled
till
the
dimples
laughed
in
her
cheeks
she
sank
upon
a
seat
beside
him
and
pulled
together
the
curtains
shutting
out
the
sight
below
very
well
then
she
put
his
hand
to
her
cheek
and
cuddled
it
i
m
glad
to
see
you
just
the
same
and
you
can
t
keep
me
from
loving
with
his
other
hand
he
smoothed
her
hair
while
unknown
to
him
and
beneath
her
lightness
she
shrank
and
quivered
at
his
touch
like
a
barbary
steed
under
the
whip
things
are
very
bad
with
me
he
said
we
ve
had
our
mine
bah
you
know
what
to
do
you
aren
t
a
cripple
you
ve
got
five
fingers
on
your
gun
that
s
it
they
all
tell
me
that
all
the
but
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
i
thought
i
did
but
i
don
t
the
law
has
come
into
this
country
and
i
ve
tried
to
meet
it
they
jumped
us
and
put
in
a
receiver
a
big
man
by
the
name
of
mcnamara
dex
wasn
t
there
and
i
let
them
do
it
when
the
old
man
learned
of
it
he
nearly
went
crazy
we
had
our
first
quarrel
he
thought
i
was
afraid
not
he
said
the
girl
i
know
him
and
he
knows
that
was
a
week
ago
we
ve
hired
the
best
lawyer
in
nome
bill
wheaton
and
we
ve
tried
to
have
the
injunction
removed
we
ve
offered
bond
in
any
sum
but
the
judge
refuses
to
accept
it
we
ve
argued
for
leave
to
appeal
but
he
won
t
give
us
the
right
the
more
i
look
into
it
the
worse
it
seems
for
the
court
wasn
t
convened
in
accordance
with
law
we
weren
t
notified
to
appear
in
our
own
behalf
we
weren
t
allowed
a
chance
to
argue
our
own
case
nothing
they
simply
slapped
on
a
receiver
and
now
they
refuse
to
allow
us
redress
from
a
legal
it
s
appalling
i
m
told
but
what
s
to
be
done
what
s
the
game
that
s
the
thing
what
are
they
up
to
i
m
nearly
out
of
my
mind
for
it
s
all
my
fault
i
didn
t
think
it
meant
anything
like
this
or
i
d
have
made
a
fight
for
possession
and
stood
them
off
at
least
as
it
is
my
partner
s
sore
and
he
s
gone
to
drinking
first
time
in
twelve
years
he
says
i
gave
the
claim
away
and
now
it
s
up
to
me
and
the
almighty
to
get
it
back
if
he
gets
full
he
ll
drive
a
wagon
into
some
church
or
go
up
and
pick
the
judge
to
pieces
with
his
fingers
to
see
what
makes
him
go
what
ve
they
got
against
you
and
dextry
some
grudge
she
questioned
no
no
we
re
not
the
only
ones
in
trouble
they
ve
jumped
the
rest
of
the
good
mines
and
put
this
mcnamara
in
as
receiver
on
all
of
them
but
that
s
small
comfort
the
swedes
are
crazy
they
ve
hired
all
the
lawyers
in
town
and
are
murdering
more
good
american
language
than
would
fill
bering
strait
dex
is
in
favor
of
getting
our
friends
together
and
throwing
the
receiver
off
he
wants
to
kill
somebody
but
we
can
t
do
that
they
ve
got
the
soldiers
to
fall
back
on
we
ve
been
warned
that
the
troops
are
instructed
to
enforce
the
court
s
action
i
don
t
know
what
the
plot
is
for
i
can
t
believe
the
old
judge
is
crooked
the

leaned
forward
where
the
light
shone
on
the
young
man
s
worried
face
the
girl
what
girl
who
is
she
her
voice
had
lost
its
lazy
caress
her
lips
had
thinned
never
was
a
woman
s
face
more
eloquent
mused
glenister
as
he
noted
her
every
thought
fled
to
this
window
to
peer
forth
fearful
lustful
hateful
as
the
case
might
be
he
had
loved
to
play
with
her
in
the
former
days
to
work
upon
her
passions
and
watch
the
changes
to
note
her
features
mirror
every
varying
emotion
from
tenderness
to
flippancy
from
anger
to
delight
and
at
his
bidding
to
see
the
pale
cheeks
glow
with
love
s
fire
the
eyes
grow
heavy
the
dainty
lips
invite
kisses
cherry
was
a
perfect
little
spoiled
animal
he
reflected
and
a
very
dangerous
one
what
girl
she
questioned
again
and
he
knew
beforehand
the
look
that
went
with
it
the
girl
i
intend
to
marry
he
said
slowly
looking
her
between
the
eyes
he
knew
he
was
cruel
he
wanted
to
be
it
satisfied
the
clamor
and
turmoil
within
him
while
he
also
felt
that
the
sooner
she
knew
and
the
colder
it
left
her
the
better
he
could
not
note
the
effect
of
the
remark
on
her
however
for
as
he
spoke
the
door
of
the
box
opened
and
the
head
of
the
bronco
kid
appeared
then
retired
instantly
with
apologies
wrong
stall
he
said
in
his
slow
voice
looking
for
another
nevertheless
his
eyes
had
covered
every
inch
of
them
noted
the
drawn
curtains
and
the
breathless
poise
of
the
woman
while
his
ears
had
caught
part
of
glenister
s
speech
you
won
t
marry
her
said
cherry
quietly
i
don
t
know
who
she
is
but
i
won
t
let
you
marry
she
rose
and
smoothed
her
skirts
it
s
time
nice
people
were
going
she
said
it
with
a
sneer
at
herself
take
me
out
through
this
crowd
i
m
living
quietly
and
i
don
t
want
these
beasts
to
follow
as
they
emerged
from
the
theatre
the
morning
air
was
cool
and
quiet
while
the
sun
was
just
rising
the
bronco
kid
lighted
a
cigar
as
they
passed
nodding
silently
at
their
greeting
his
eyes
followed
them
while
his
hands
were
so
still
that
the
match
burned
through
to
his
when
they
had
gone
his
teeth
met
and
ground
savagely
through
the
tobacco
so
that
the
cigar
fell
while
he
muttered
so
that
s
the
girl
you
intend
to
marry
we
ll
see
by
god
chapter
viii
dextry
makes
a
call
the
water
front
had
a
strong
attraction
for
helen
chester
and
rarely
did
a
fair
day
pass
without
finding
her
in
some
quiet
spot
from
which
she
could
watch
the
shifting
life
along
its
edge
the
ships
at
anchor
and
the
varied
incidents
of
the
surf
this
morning
she
sat
in
a
dory
pulled
high
up
on
the
beach
bathed
in
the
bright
sunshine
and
staring
at
the
rollers
while
lines
of
concentration
wrinkled
her
brow
the
wind
had
blown
for
some
days
till
the
ocean
beat
heavily
across
the
shallow
bar
and
now
as
it
became
quieter
longshoremen
were
launching
their
craft
preparing
to
resume
their
traffic
not
until
the
previous
day
had
the
news
of
her
friends
misfortune
come
to
her
and
although
she
had
heard
no
hint
of
fraud
she
began
to
realize
that
they
were
involved
in
a
serious
tangle
to
the
questions
which
she
anxiously
put
to
her
uncle
he
had
replied
that
their
difficulty
arose
from
a
technicality
in
the
mining
laws
which
another
man
had
been
shrewd
enough
to
profit
by
it
was
a
complicated
question
he
said
and
one
requiring
time
to
thrash
out
to
an
equitable
settlement
she
had
undertaken
to
remind
him
of
the
service
these
men
had
done
her
but
with
a
smile
he
interrupted
he
could
not
allow
such
things
to
influence
his
judicial
attitude
and
she
must
not
endeavor
to
prejudice
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
recognizing
the
justice
of
this
she
had
desisted
for
many
days
the
girl
had
caught
scattered
talk
between
the
judge
and
mcnamara
and
between
struve
and
his
associates
but
it
all
seemed
foreign
and
dry
and
beyond
the
fact
that
it
bore
on
the
litigation
over
the
anvil
creek
mines
she
understood
nothing
and
cared
less
particularly
as
a
new
interest
had
but
recently
come
into
her
life
an
interest
in
the
form
of
a
man
mcnamara
he
had
begun
with
quiet
admiration
of
her
which
had
rapidly
increased
until
his
attentions
had
become
of
a
singularly
positive
and
resistless
character
judge
stillman
was
openly
delighted
while
the
court
of
one
like
alec
mcnamara
could
but
flatter
any
girl
in
his
presence
helen
felt
herself
rebelling
at
his
suit
yet
as
distance
separated
them
she
thought
ever
more
kindly
of
it
this
state
of
mind
contrasted
oddly
with
her
feelings
towards
the
other
man
she
had
met
for
in
this
country
there
were
but
two
when
glenister
was
with
her
she
saw
his
love
lying
nakedly
in
his
eyes
and
it
exercised
some
spell
which
drew
her
to
him
in
spite
of
herself
but
when
he
had
gone
back
came
the
distrust
the
terror
of
the
brute
she
felt
was
there
behind
it
all
the
one
appealed
to
her
while
present
the
other
pled
strongest
while
away
now
she
was
attempting
to
analyze
her
feelings
and
face
the
future
squarely
for
she
realized
that
her
affairs
neared
a
crisis
and
this
too
not
a
month
after
meeting
the
men
she
wondered
if
she
would
come
to
love
her
uncle
s
friend
she
did
not
know
of
the
other
she
was
sure
she
never
could
busied
with
these
reflections
she
noticed
the
familiar
figure
of
dextry
wandering
aimlessly
he
was
not
unkempt
and
yet
his
air
gave
her
the
impression
of
prolonged
sleeplessness
spying
her
he
approached
and
seated
himself
in
the
sand
against
the
boat
while
at
her
greeting
he
broke
into
talk
as
if
he
was
needful
only
of
her
friendly
presence
to
stir
his
confidential
chords
into
active
vibration
we
re
in
turrible
shape
miss
he
said
our
claim
s
jumped
somebody
run
in
and
talked
the
boy
out
of
it
while
i
was
gone
and
now
we
can
t
get
em
off
he
s
been
tryin
this
here
new
law
game
that
brought
in
this
summer
i
ve
been
drunk
that
s
what
makes
me
look
so
he
said
the
last
not
in
the
spirit
of
apology
for
rarely
does
your
frontiersman
consider
that
his
require
palliation
but
rather
after
the
manner
of
one
purveying
news
of
mild
interest
as
he
would
inform
you
that
his
surcingle
had
broken
or
that
he
had
witnessed
a
lynching
what
made
them
jump
your
claim
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
nothin
about
it
because
as
i
remarked
previous
i
ain
t
follered
the
totterin
footsteps
of
the
law
none
too
close
nor
do
i
intend
to
i
simply
draws
out
of
the
game
fer
a
spell
and
lets
the
youngster
have
his
fling
then
if
he
can
t
make
good
i
ll
take
the
cards
and
finish
it
for
him
it
s
like
the
time
i
was
ranchin
with
an
englishman
up
in
montana
this
here
party
claimed
the
misfortune
of

he

it
i

and
it

to

me
that
he
s
a
feller
in
spite
of
his
ridin
an
pinochle
he

but
he

seton
book
that
tells
him
all
about
everything
from

and
finally
this
party

home
for
some
rooshian

or
thereabouts
four
of
em
great
big
blue
ones
they
was
as
handsome
and
imposin
as
a
set
of
teeth
but
somehow
they
didn
t
seem
to
savvy
our
play
none
one
day
the
cook
rolled
a
rain
bar
l
from
the
kitchen
and
when
them
blooded
critters
saw
it
comin
they
throwed
down
their
tails
and
tore
out
like
rabbits
after
that
i
couldn
t
see
no
good
in
em
with
a
they

to
pieces
like

anything
oh
rully
perfectly
dreadful
well
it
wasn
t
a
week
later
that
he
went
over
to
the
east
line
with
me
to
mend
a
barb
wire
i
had
my
pliers
and
a
hatchet
and
some
staples
about
a
mile
from
the
house
we
jumped
up
a
little
brown
bear
that
scampered
off
when
he
seen
us
but
bein
agin
a
bluff
where
he
couldn
t
get

he
climbed
a
h

with
excitement

he
with
dignity

it
but
it

be
good
renders
says
i
but
don
t
forgit
the
well
i
throwed
sticks
at
the
critter
when
he
tried
to
unclimb
the
tree
till
finally
the
boss
got
back
with
his
dogs
they
set
up
an
awful
holler
when
they
see
the
bear
first
one
they
d
ever
smelled
i
reckon
and
the
little
feller
crawled
up
in
some
forks
and
watched
things
cautious
while
they
leaped
about
bayin
most
fierce
and
how
you
goin
to
get
him
down
says
i
i
ll
shoot
him
in
the
lower

says
the
britisher
so
he
cawn
t
bite
the
dogs
it
ll
give
em
he
takes
aim
at
bear
s
chin
and
misses
it
three
times
runnin
he
s
that
excited
settle
down
h
anglish
says
i
he
ain
t
got
no
double
chins
how
many
shells
left
in
your
gun
when
he

more
for
he
hadn
t
stopped
to
fill
the
magazine
so
i
cautions
him
you
re
shootin
too
low
raise
he
raised
her
all
right
and
caught
bruin
in
the
snout
what
followed
thereafter
was
most
too
quick
to
notice
for
the
poor
bear
let
out
a
bawl
dropped
off
his
limb
into
the
midst
of
them
ragin
tur
ble
hounds
an
hugged
em
to
death
one
after
another
like
he
was
doin
a
system
of
health
exercises
he
took
em
to
his
boosum
as
if
he
d
just
got
back
off

long
trip
then
droppin
the
last
one

at
that
younger
son

holler
hisself
an
i
had
to

in
with
the
hatchet
and
kill
the
brute
though
i
was
most
dead
from
laughin
that
s
how
it
is
with
me
an
glenister
the
old
man
concluded
when
he
gets
tired
experimentin
with
this
new
law
game
of
hisn
i
ll
step
in
an
do
business
on
a
you
talk
as
if
you
wouldn
t
get
fair
play
said
helen
we
won
t
said
he
with
conviction
i
look
on
all
lawyers
with
suspicion
even
to
old
your
uncle
askin
your
pardon
an
gettin
it
bein
as
i
m
a
friend
an
he
ain
t
no
real
relation
of
yours
anyhow
no
sir
they
re
all
dextry
held
the
western
distrust
of
the
legal
profession
comprehensive
unreasoning
deep
is
the
old
man
all
the
kin
you
ve
got
he
questioned
when
she
refused
to
discuss
the
matter
he
is
in
a
way
i
have
a
brother
or
i
hope
i
have
somewhere
he
ran
away
when
we
were
both
little
tads
and
i
haven
t
seen
him
since
i
heard
about
him
indirectly
at
skagway
three
years
ago
during
the
big
rush
to
the
klondike
but
he
has
never
been
home
when
father
died
i
went
to
live
with
uncle
arthur
some
day
perhaps
i
ll
find
my
brother
he
s
cruel
to
hide
from
me
this
way
for
there
are
only
we
two
left
and
i
ve
loved
him
she
spoke
sadly
and
her
mood
blended
well
with
the
gloom
of
her
companion
so
they
stared
silently
out
over
the
heaving
green
waters
it
s
a
good
thing
me
an
the
kid
had
a
little
piece
of
money
ahead
dextry
resumed
later
reverting
to
the
thought
that
lay
uppermost
in
his
mind
cause
we
d
be
up
against
it
right
if
we
hadn
t
the
boy
couldn
t
have
amused
himself
none
with
these
court
proceedings
because
they
come
high
i
call
em
luxuries
like
brandied
peaches
an
silk
i
don
t
trust
these
jim
crow
banks
no
more
than
i
do
lawyers
neither
no
sirree
i
bought
a
iron
safe
an
hauled
it
out
to
the
mine
she
weighs
eighteen
hundred
and
we
keep
our
money
locked
up
there
we
ve
got
a
feller
named
johnson
watchin
it
now
steal
it
well
hardly
they
can
t
bust
her
open
without
a
stick
of
giant
which
would
rouse
everybody
in
five
miles
an
they
can
t
lug
her
off
bodily
she
s
too
heavy
no
it
s
safer
there
than
any
place
i
know
of
there
ain
t
no
abscondin
cashiers
an
all
that
i
m
goin
back
to
live
on
the
claim
an
watch
this
receiver
man
till
the
thing
s
when
the
girl
arose
to
go
he
accompanied
her
up
through
the
deep
sand
of
the
street
to
the
main
muddy
thoroughfare
of
the
camp
as
yet
the
planked
and
gravelled
pavements
which
later
threaded
the
town
were
unknown
and
the
incessant
traffic
had
worn
the
road
into
a
quagmire
of
slush
almost
with
which
the
store
fronts
and
awnings
were
plentifully
shot
and
spattered
from
passing
teams
whenever
a
wagon
approached
pedestrians
fled
to
the
shelter
of
neighboring
doorways
watching
a
chance
to
dodge
out
again
when
vehicles
passed
from
the
comparative
solidity
of
the
main
street
out
into
the
morasses
that
constituted
the
rest
of
the
town
they
adventured
perilously
their
horses
plunging
snorting
terrified
amid
an
atmosphere
of
profanity
discouraged
animals
were
down
constantly
and
no
even
with
rubber
boots
ventured
off
the
planks
that
led
from
house
to
house
to
avoid
a
splashing
team
dextry
pulled
his
companion
close
in
against
the
entrance
to
the
northern
saloon
standing
before
her
protectingly
although
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
the
bronco
kid
had
just
arisen
and
was
now
loafing
preparatory
to
the
active
duties
of
his
profession
he
was
speaking
with
the
proprietor
when
dextry
and
the
girl
sought
shelter
just
without
the
open
door
so
he
caught
a
fair
though
fleeting
glimpse
of
her
as
she
flashed
a
curious
look
inside
she
had
never
been
so
close
to
a
before
and
would
have
liked
to
peer
in
more
carefully
had
she
dared
but
her
companion
moved
forward
at
the
first
look
the
bronco
kid
had
broken
off
in
his
speech
and
stared
at
her
as
though
at
an
apparition
when
she
had
vanished
he
spoke
to
reilly
who
s
that
reilly
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
without
further
question
the
kid
turned
back
towards
the
empty
theatre
and
out
of
the
back
door
he
moved
nonchalantly
till
he
was
outside
then
with
the
speed
of
a
colt
ran
down
the
narrow
planking
between
the
buildings
turned
parallel
to
the
front
street
leaped
from
board
to
board
splashed
through
puddles
of
water
till
he
reached
the
next
alley
stamping
the
mud
from
his
shoes
and
pulling
down
his
sombrero
he
sauntered
out
into
the
main
thoroughfare
dextry
and
his
companion
had
crossed
to
the
other
side
and
were
approaching
so
the
gambler
gained
a
fair
view
of
them
he
searched
every
inch
of
the
girl
s
face
and
figure
then
as
she
made
to
turn
her
eyes
in
his
direction
he
slouched
away
he
followed
however
at
a
distance
till
he
saw
the
man
leave
her
then
on
up
to
the
big
hotel
he
shadowed
her
a
later
he
was
drinking
in
the
golden
gate
with
an
acquaintance
who
ministered
to
the
mechanical
details
behind
the
hotel
counter
who
s
the
girl
i
saw
come
in
just
now
he
inquired
i
guess
you
mean
the
judge
s
both
men
spoke
in
the
dead
restrained
tones
that
go
with
their
callings
what
s
her
name
chester
i
think
why
look
good
to
you
kid
although
the
other
neither
spoke
nor
made
sign
the
bartender
construed
his
silence
as
acquiescence
and
continued
with
a
conscious
glance
at
his
own
reflection
while
he
adjusted
his
diamond
well
she
can
have
i
ve
got
it
fixed
to
meet
i
guess
not
said
the
kid
suddenly
with
an
inflection
that
startled
the
other
from
his
preening
then
as
he
went
out
the
man
mused
gee
bronco
s
got
the
worst
eye
in
the
camp
makes
me
creep
when
he
throws
it
on
me
with
that
muddy
look
he
acted
like
he
was
at
noon
the
next
day
as
he
prepared
to
go
to
the
claim
dextry
s
partner
burst
in
upon
him
glenister
was
dishevelled
and
his
eyes
shone
with
intense
excitement
what
d
you
think
they
ve
done
now
he
cried
as
greeting
i
dunno
what
is
it
they
ve
broken
open
the
safe
and
taken
our
what
the
old
man
in
turn
was
on
his
feet
the
grudge
which
he
had
felt
against
glenister
in
the
past
few
days
forgotten
in
this
common
misfortune
yes
by
heaven
they
ve
swiped
our
money
our
tents
tools
teams
books
hose
and
all
of
our
personal
property
everything
they
threw
johnson
off
and
took
the
whole
works
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
went
out
to
the
claim
and
they
wouldn
t
let
me
go
near
the
workings
they
ve
got
every
mine
on
anvil
creek
guarded
the
same
way
and
they
aren
t
going
to
let
us
come
around
even
when
they
clean
up
they
told
me
so
this
but
look
here
demanded
dextry
sharply
the
money
in
that
safe
belongs
to
us
that
s
money
we
brought
in
from
the
states
the
court
ain
t
got
no
right
to
it
what
kind
of
a
damn
law
is
that
oh
as
to
law
they
don
t
pay
any
attention
to
it
any
more
said
glenister
bitterly
i
made
a
mistake
in
not
killing
the
first
man
that
set
foot
on
the
claim
i
was
a
sucker
and
now
we
re
up
against
a
stiff
game
the
swedes
are
in
the
same
fix
too
this
last
order
has
left
them
i
don
t
understand
it
yet
said
dextry
why
it
s
this
way
the
judge
has
issued
what
he
calls
an
order
enlarging
the
powers
of
the
receiver
and
it
authorizes
mcnamara
to
take
possession
of
everything
on
the
claims
tents
tools
stores
and
personal
property
of
all
kinds
it
was
issued
last
night
without
notice
to
our
side
so
wheaton
says
and
they
served
it
this
morning
early
i
went
out
to
see
mcnamara
and
when
i
got
there
i
found
him
in
our
private
tent
with
the
safe
broken
what
does
this
mean
i
said
and
then
he
showed
me
the
new
order
i
m
responsible
to
the
court
for
every
penny
of
this
money
said
he
and
for
every
tool
on
the
claim
in
view
of
that
i
can
t
allow
you
to
go
near
the
not
go
near
the
workings
said
i
do
you
mean

won
t
let
us
see

a
square
deal
if
we
don
t
see
the
gold
weighed
i
m
an
officer
of
the
court
and
under
bond
said
he
and
the
smiling
triumph
in
his
eyes
made
me
crazy
you
re
a
lying
thief
i
said
looking
at
him
square
and
you
re
going
too
far
you
played
me
for
a
fool
once
and
made
it
stick
but
it
won
t
work
he
looked
injured
and
aggrieved
and
called
in
voorhees
the
marshal
i
can
t
grasp
the
thing
at
all
everybody
seems
to
be
against
us
the
judge
the

the
prosecuting
attorney
everybody
yet
they
ve
done
it
all
according
to
law

and

to
the

and
inquired
for

stillman
s
room
a
boy
attempted
to
take
his
name
but
he
seized
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
sat
him
in
his
seat
proceeding
unannounced
to
the
suite
to
which
he
had
been
directed
hearing
voices
he
knocked
and
then
without
awaiting
a
summons
walked
in
the
room
was
fitted
like
an
office
with
desk
table
and
other
rooms
opened
from
it
on
both
sides
two
men
were
talking
earnestly
one
and
clerical
the
other
tall
picturesque
and
masterful
with
his
first
glance
the
miner
knew
that
before
him
were
the
two
he
had
come
to
see
and
that
in
reality
he
had
to
deal
with
but
one
the
big
man
who
shot
at
him
the
level
glances
we
are
engaged
said
the
judge
very
busily
engaged
sir
will
you
call
again
in
half
an
hour
dextry
looked
him
over
carefully
from
head
to
foot
then
turned
his
back
on
him
and
regarded
the
other
neither
he
nor
mcnamara
spoke
but
their
eyes
were
busy
and
each
instinctively
knew
that
here
was
a
foe
what
do
you
want

inquired
finally

dropped
in

mcnamara
while

gasped
and
backed
against
the
desk
but
mcnamara
idly
swung
his
leg
as
he
sat
sidewise
on
the
table
his
only
sign
of
interest
was
a
quickening
of
the
eyes
a
fact
of
which
dextry
made
mental
note
yes
said
the
miner
disregarding
the
alarm
of
the
lawyer
you
can
wear

said
glenister
a
few
days
later
when
mcnamara
jumped
our
safe
he
put
us
down
and
out
there
s
no
use
fighting
in
this
court
any
longer
for
the
judge
won
t
let
us
work
the
ground
ourselves
even
if
we
give
bond
and
he
won
t
grant
an
appeal
he
says
his
orders
aren
t
appealable
we
ought
to
send
wheaton
out
to
frisco
and
have
him
take
the
case
to
the
higher
courts
maybe
he
can
get
a

if
it
s
as
bad
as
it
sounds
it
s
sure
horrible
ain
t
there
no
cure
for
it
it
simply
means
that
the

there

that
it

too
late
this

is
looting
our

under
color
of

figures
on

mines
before

i

out
accordin

i
m
goin
to
proceed
accordin
to
during
the
past
two
days
the
partners
had
haunted
the
where
their
lawyer
together
with
the
counsel
for
the
scandinavians
had
argued
and
pleaded
trying
every
possible
professional
and
unprofessional
artifice
in
search
of
relief
from
the
arbitrary
rulings
of
the
court
while
hourly
they
had
become
more
strongly
suspicious
of
some
sinister
plot
some
hidden
powerful
understanding
back
of
the
judge
and
the
entire
mechanism
of
justice
they
had
fought
with
the
fury
of
men
who
battle
for
life
and
had
grown
to
hate
the
lines
of
stillman
s
vacillating
face
the
bluster
of
the
and
the
smirking
confidence
of
the
clerks
for
it
seemed
that
they
all
worked
mechanically
like
toys
at
the
dictates
of
alec
mcnamara
at
last
when
they
had
ceased
beaten
and
exhausted
they
were
too
confused
with
technical
phrases
to
grasp
anything
except
the
fact
that
relief
was
denied
them
that
their
claims
were
to
be
worked
by
the
receiver
and
as
a
crowning
defeat
they
learned
that
the
judge
would
move
his
court
to
michael
s
and
hear
no
cases
until
he
returned
a
month
later
meanwhile
mcnamara
hired
every
idle
man
he
could
lay
hand
upon
and
ripped
the
placers
open
with
double
shifts
every
day
a
stream
of
yellow
dust
poured
into
the
bank
and
was
locked
in
his
vaults
while
those
who
attempted
to
witness
the
were
ejected
from
their
claims
the
politician
had
worked
with
incredible
swiftness
and
system
and
a
fortnight
after
landing
he
had
made
good
his
boast
to
struve
and
was
in
charge
of
every
good
claim
in
the
district
the
owners
were
ousted
their
appeals
argued
and
denied
and
the
court
gone
for
thirty
days
leaving
him
a
clear
field
for
his
operations
he
felt
a
contempt
for
most
of
his
victims
who
were
swedes
grasping
neither
the
purport
nor
the
magnitude
of
his
operation
and
as
to
those
litigants
who
were
discerning
enough
to
see
its
enormity
he
trusted
to
his
organization
to
thwart
them
the
two
partners
had
come
to
feel
that
they
were
beating
against
a
wall
and
had
also
come
squarely
to
face
the
proposition
that
they
were
without
funds
wherewith
to
continue
their
battle
it
was
maddening
for
them
to
think
of
the
daily
robbery
that
they
suffered
for
the
midas
turned
out
many
ounces
of
gold
at
every
shift
and
more
maddening
to
realize
the
receiver
s
shrewdness
in
crippling
them
by
his
theft
of
the
gold
in
their
safe
that
had
been
his
crowning
stroke
we
must
get
money
quick
said
glenister
do
you
think
we
can
borrow
borrow
sniffed
dextry
folks
don

in
they
relapsed
into
a
moody
silence
i
met
a
feller
this
mornin
that
s
workin
on
the
midas
the
old
man
resumed
he
came
in

fer
a

of
gum

he
says
they

into
awful
rich
ground
so
rich
that

clean
up
every
morning
when
the
night
shift

glenister
growled
if
we
had
even
a
part
of
one
of
those
we
could
send
wheaton
in
the
midst
of
his
bitterness
a
thought
struck
him
he
made
as
though
to
speak
then
closed
his
mouth
but
his
partner
s
eyes
were
on
him
filled
with
a
suppressed
but
growing
fire
dextry
lowered
his
voice
cautiously
there

stared
back
while
his
pulse
pounded
at
something
that
lay
in
the

whispered
the
younger
following
out
his
thought
they

he
couldn

excuse
to

said
dextry
who
can
we
get
at
that
moment
as
though
in
answer
the
door
opened
with
the
scant
ceremony
that
friends
of
the
frontier
are
wont
to
observe
admitting
the
attenuated
flapping
figure
of
slapjack
simms
and
dextry
fell
upon
him
with
the
hunger
of
a
wolf
it
was
midnight
and
over
the
dark
walls
of
the
valley
peered
a
multitude
of
stars
while
away
on
the
southern
horizon
there
glowed
a
subdued
effulgence
as
though
from
hidden
fires
beneath
the
gold
god
s
caldron
or
as
though
the
phosphorescence
of
bering
had
spread
upward
into
the
skies
although
each
night
grew
longer
it
was
not
yet
necessary
to
light
the
men
at
work
in
the
cuts
there
were
perhaps
two
hours
in
which
it
was
difficult
to
see
at
a
distance
but
the
dawn
came
early
hence
no
provision
had
been
made
for
torches
five
minutes
before
the
hour
the
boss
lowered
the
gates
in
the
dam
and
as
the
rush
from
the
sluices
subsided
his
men
quit
work
and
climbed
the
bluff
to
the
mess
tent
the
dwellings
of
the
midas
as
has
already
been
explained
sat
back
from
the
creek
at
a
distance
of
a
city
block
the
workings
being
thus
partially
hidden
under
the
brow
of
the
steep
bank
it
is
customary
to
leave
a
watchman
in
the
pit
during
the
noon
and
midnight
hours
not
only
to
see
that
strangers
preserve
a
neutral
attitude
but
also
to
watch
the
and
water
supply
the
night
man
of
the
midas
had
been
warned
of
his
responsibility
and
knowing
that
much
gold
lay
in
his
keeping
was
disposed
to
gaze
on
the
with
the
sourness
of
suspicion
therefore
as
a
man
leading
a
packhorse
approached
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
his
eyes
were
on
him
from
the
moment
he
appeared
the
road
wound
along
the
gravel
of
the
bars
and
passed
in
proximity
to
the
flumes
however
the
wayfarer
paid
no
attention
to
them
and
the
watchman
detected
an
explanatory
weariness
in
his
slow
gait
some
prospector
getting
in
from
a
trip
he
thought
the
stranger
stopped
scratched
a
match
and
as
he
undertook
to
light
his
pipe
the
observer
caught
the
mahogany
shine
of
a
negro
s
face
the
match
sputtered
out
and
then
came
impatient
blasphemy
as
he
searched
for
another
evenin
sah
oblige
me
with
a
match
he
addressed
the
watcher
on
the
bank
above
and
without
waiting
a
reply
began
to
climb
upward
no
smoker
on
the
trail
will
deny
the
luxury
of
a
light
to
the
most
humble
so
as
the
negro
gained
his
level
the
man
reached
forth
to
accommodate
him
without
warning
the
black
man
leaped
forward
with
the
ferocity
of
an
animal
and
struck
the
other
a
fearful
blow
the
watchman
sank
with
a
faint
startled
cry
and
the
african
dragged
him
out
of
sight
over
the
brow
of
the
bank
where
he
rapidly
tied
him
hand
and
foot
stuffing
a
gag
into
his
mouth
at
the
same
moment
two
other
figures
rounded
the
bend
below
and
approached
they
were
mounted
and
leading
a
third
as
well
as
other
reaching
the
workings
they
dismounted
then
began
a
strange
procedure
for
one
man
clambered
upon
the
sluices
and
with
a
pick
ripped
out
the
riffles
this
was
a
matter
of
only
a
few
seconds
then
seizing
a
shovel
he
transferred
the
concentrates
which
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boxes
into
canvas
sacks
which
his
companion
held
as
each
bag
was
filled
it
was
tied
and
dumped
into
the
cut
they
treated
but
four
boxes
in
this
way
leaving
the
lower
of
the
flume
untouched
for
anvil
creek
gold
is
coarse
and
the
heart
of
the
lies
where
it
is
thrown
in
gathering
the
sacks
together
they
lashed
them
upon
the
then
mounted
the
second
string
of
sluices
and
began
as
before
throughout
it
all
they
worked
with
feverish
haste
and
in
unbroken
silence
every
moment
flashing
quick
glances
at
the
figure
of
the
lookout
who
stood
on
the
crest
above
half
dimmed
in
the
shadow
of
a
willow
clump
judging
by
their
rapidity
and
sureness
they
were
expert
miners
from
the
tent
came
the
voices
of
the
night
shift
at
table
and
the
faint
rattle
of
dishes
while
the
canvas
walls
glowed
from
the
lights
within
like
great
hidden
in
the
grass
the
foreman
finishing
his
meal
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
mess
tent
and
pausing
to
accustom
his
eyes
to
the
gloom
peered
perfunctorily
towards
the
creek
the
watchman
detached
himself
from
the
shadow
moving
out
into
plain
sight
and
the
boss
turned
back
the
two
men
below
were
now
working
on
the
sluices
which
lay
close
under
the
bank
and
were
thus
hidden
from
the
tent
mcnamara

riches

fired

chester
with
the
desire
to
witness
a
so
they
had
ridden
out
from
town
in
time
for
supper
at
the
claim
she
had
not
known
whither
he
led
her
only
understanding
that
provision
for
her
entertainment
would
be
made
with
the
superintendent
s
wife
upon
recognizing
the
midas
she
had
endeavored
to
question
him
as
to
why
her
friends
had
been
dispossessed
and
he
had
answered
as
it
seemed
straight
and
true
the
ground
was
in
dispute
he
said
another
man
claimed
it
and
while
the
litigation
pended
he
was
in
charge
for
the
court
to
see
that
neither
party
received
injury
he
spoke
adroitly
and
it
satisfied
her
to
have
the
proposition
resolved
into
such
simplicity
she
had
come
prepared
to
spend
the
night
and
witness
the
early
morning
operation
so
the
receiver
made
the
most
of
his
opportunity
he
showed
her
over
the
workings
explaining
the
many
things
that
were
strange
to
her
not
only
was
he
in
himself
a
fascinating
figure
to
any
woman
but
wherever
he
went
men
regarded
him
deferentially
and
nothing
affects
a
woman
s
judgment
more
promptly
than
this
obvious
sign
of
power
he
spent
the
evening
with
her
talking
of
his
early
days
and
the
things
he
had
done
in
the
west
his
story
matching
the
picturesqueness
of
her
quarters
with
their
rough
furnishings
of
skins
and
blankets
being
a
keen
observer
as
well
as
a
finished
raconteur
he
had
woven
a
spell
of
words
about
the
girl
leaving
her
in
a
state
of
tumult
and
indecision
when
at
last
towards
midnight
he
retired
to
his
own
tent
she
knew
to
what
end
all
this
was
working
and
yet
knew
not
what
her
answer
would
be
when
the
question
came
which
lay
behind
it
all
at
moments
she
felt
the
wonderful
attraction
of
the
man
and
still
there
was
some
distrust
of
him
which
she
could
not
fathom
again
her
thoughts
reverted
to
glenister
the
impetuous
and
she
compared
the
two
so
similar
in
some
ways
so
utterly
opposed
in
others
it
was
when
she
heard
the
night
shift
at
their
meal
that
she
threw
a
silken
shawl
about
her
head
stepped
into
the
cool
night
and
picked
her
way
down
towards
the
roar
of
the
creek
a
breath
of
air
and
then
to
bed
she
thought
she
saw
the
tall
figure
of
the
watchman
and
made
for
him
he
seemed
oddly
interested
in
her
approach
watching
her
very
closely
almost
as
though
alarmed
it
was
doubtless
because
there
were
so
few
women
out
here
or
possibly
on
account
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
away
with
conventions
this
was
the
land
of
instinct
and
impulse
she
would
talk
to
him
the
man
drew
his
hat
more
closely
about
his
face
and
moved
off
as
she
came
up
glenister
had
been
in
her
thoughts
a
moment
since
and
she
now
noted
that
here
was
another
with
the
same
great
square
shoulders
and
erect
head
then
she
saw
with
a
start
that
this
one
was
a
negro
he
carried
a
winchester
and
seemed
to
watch
her
carefully
yet
with
indecision
to
express
her
interest
and
to
break
the
silence
she
questioned
him
but
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
he
stepped
towards
her
and
spoke
roughly
what
then
he
paused
and
stammered
in
a
strangely
altered
and
unnatural
voice
yass
m
i
m
the
she
noted
two
other
darkies
at
work
below
and
was
vaguely
surprised
not
so
much
at
their
presence
as
at
the
manner
in
which
they
moved
for
they
seemed
under
stress
of
some
great
haste
running
hither
and
yon
she
saw
horses
standing
in
the
trail
and
sensed
something
indefinably
odd
and
alarming
in
the
air
turning
to
the
man
she
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
when
from
the
rank
grass
under
her
feet
came
a
noise
which
set
her
and
at
which
her
suspicions
leaped
full
to
the
solution
it
was
the
groan
of
a
man
again
he
gave
voice
to
his
pain
and
she
knew
that
she
stood
face
to
face
with
something
sinister
tales
of
sluice
robbers
had
come
to
her
and
rumors
of
the
daring
raids
into
which
men
were
lured
by
the
yellow
sheen
and
yet
this
was
incredible
a
hundred
men
lay
within
sound
of
her
voice
she
could
hear
their
laughter
one
was
whistling
a
popular
refrain
a
away
on
every
hand
were
other
camps
a
scream
from
her
would
bring
them
all
nonsense
this
was
no
sluice
robbery
and
then
the
man
in
the
bushes
below
moaned
for
the
third
time
what
is
that
she
said
without
reply
the
negro
lowered
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
till
it
covered
her
breast
and
at
the
same
time
she
heard
the
double
click
of
the
hammer
keep
still
and
don
t
move
he
warned
we
re
desperate
and
we
can
t
take
any
chances
oh
you
are
stealing
the
gold
she
was
wildly
frightened
yet
stood
still
while
the
lookout
anxiously
divided
his
attention
between
her
and
the
tents
above
until
his
companions
signalled
him
that
they
were
through
and
the
horses
were
loaded
then
he
spoke
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
you
but
i
guess
i
ll
tie
you
what
she
said
i
m
going
to
tie
and
gag
you
so
you
can
t
oh
don
t
you
she
cried
fiercely
i
ll
stand
right
here
till
you
ve
gone
and
i
won
t
scream
i
she
looked
up
at
him
appealingly
at
which
he
dipped
his
head
so
that
she
caught
only
a
glimpse
of
his
face
and
then
backed
away
all
right
don
t
try
it
because
i
ll
be
hidden
in
those
bushes
yonder
at
the
bend
and
i
ll
keep
you
covered
till
the
others
are
he
leaped
down
the
bank
ran
to
the
cavalcade
mounted
quickly
and
the
three
lashed
their
horses
into
a
run
disappearing
up
the
trail
around
the
sharp
curve
she
heard
the
blows
of
their
quirts
as
they
whipped
the
packhorses
they
were
long
out
of
sight
before
the
girl
moved
or
made
sound
although
she
knew
that
none
of
the
three
had
paused
at
the
bend
she
only
stood
and
gazed
for
as
they
galloped
off
she
had
heard
the
scrap
of
a
broken
sentence
it
was
but
one
excited
word
sounding
through
the
rattle
of
hoofs
her
own
name
helen
and
yet
because
of
it
she
did
not
voice
the
alarm
but
rather
began
to
piece
together
bit
by
bit
the
strange
points
of
this
adventure
she
recalled
the
outlines
of
her
captor
with
a
wrinkle
of
perplexity
her
fright
disappeared
entirely
giving
place
to
intense
excitement
no
no
it
can
t
be
and
yet
i
wonder
if
it
she
cried
oh
i
wonder
if
it
could
be
she
opened
her
lips
to
cry
aloud
then
hesitated
she
started
towards
the
tents
then
paused
and
for
many
moments
after
the
had
died
out
she
stayed
undecided
surely
she
wished
to
give
the
signal
to
force
the
fierce
pursuit
what
meant
this
robbery
this
defiance
of
the
law
of
her
uncle
s
edicts
and
of
mcnamara
they
were
common
thieves
criminals
outlaws
these
men
deserving
punishment
and
yet
she
recalled
a
darker
night
when
she
herself
had
sobbed
and
quivered
with
the
terrors
of
pursuit
and
two
men
had
shielded
her
with
their
bodies
she
turned
and
sped
towards
the
tents
bursting
in
through
the
canvas
door
instantly
every
man
rose
to
his
feet
at
sight
of
her
pallid
face
her
flashing
eyes
and
rumpled
hair
sluice
robbers
she
cried
breathlessly
quick
a
the
watchman
is
hurt
a
roar
shook
the
night
air
and
the
men
poured
out
past
her
while
the
day
shift
came
tumbling
forth
from
every
quarter
in
various
stages
of
undress
where
who
did
it
where
did
they
go
mcnamara
appeared
among
them
fierce
and
commanding
seeming
to
grasp
the
situation
intuitively
without
explanation
from
her
come

he
was
mounted

as
he
spoke
and

joined
him

waved
his
long
arm

mountains

into

of

to

and
a
as
they
made
ready
to
ride
away
the
girl
cried

way
they
went

gulch

she
pointed
out
of
the
valley
towards
the
dim
glow
on
the
southern
horizon
and
the

rode
away

the
gloom

x
the

of

up
creek
the
three
negroes
fled
past
other
camps
to
where
the
stream
branched
here
they
took
to
the
right
and
urged
their
horses
along
a
forsaken
trail
to
the
of
the
little
tributary
and
over
the
low
saddle
they
had
endeavored
to
reach
unfrequented
paths
as
soon
as
possible
in
order
that
they
might
pass
unnoticed
before
quitting
the
valley
they
halted
their
heaving
horses
and
selecting
a
stagnant
pool
scoured
the
grease
paint
from
their
features
as
best
they
could
their
ears
were
strained
for
sounds
of
pursuit
but
as
the
moments
passed
and
none
came
the
tension
eased
somewhat
and
they
conversed
guardedly
as
the
morning
light
spread
they
crossed
the
summit
of
the
range
but
paused
again
and
removing
two
saddles
hid
them
among
the
rocks

left
the
others
here
and
rode
southward
down
the
dry
creek

towards
town
while
the
partners
shifted
part
of
the
weight
from
the
overloaded
packmules
to
the
remaining
and
continued
eastward
along
the
barren
comb
of
hills

wonder
what
helen
was
doing
there
glenister
answered
irrelevantly
for
he
had
been
more
shaken
by
his
encounter
with
her
than
at
his
part
in
the
rest
of
the
enterprise
and
his
mind
which
should
have
been
busied
with
the
flight
held
nothing
but
pictures
of
her
as
she
stood
in
the
half
darkness
under

of
his

glenister
while
his
thick
brows
came
forward
and
ugly
lines
hardened
in
his
face
in
the
gray
of
the
early
morning
they
descended
the
into
the
wide
valley
of
the
nome
river
and
filed
out
across
the
rolling
country
to
the
river
bluffs
where
cleverly
concealed
among
the
willows
was
a
rocker
this
they
set
up
then
proceeded
to
wash
the
dirt
from
the
sacks
carefully
yet
with
the
utmost
speed
for
there
was
serious
danger
of
discovery
it
was
wonderful
this
treasure
of
the
richest
ground
since
the
days
of
and
the
men
worked
with
shining
eyes
and
hands
the
gold
was
coarse
and
many
ragged
yellow
lumps
too
large
to
pass
through
the
screen
rolled
in
the
hopper
while
the
aprons
bellied
with
its
weight
in
the
pans
which
they
had
provided
there
grew
a
gleaming
heap
of
wet
raw
gold
shortly
by
divergent
routes
the
partners
rode
unnoticed
into
town
and
into
the
excitement
of
the
news
while
the
tardy
still
lingered
over
their
breakfasts
far
out
in
the
roadstead
lay
the
black
smoke
pouring
from
her
stack
a

was
returning
from
its

glenister
forced
his
lathered
horse
down
to

hung
about

they
informed
him
if
you
want
to
go
to

outside
you
ll
have
to
wait
for
the
fleet
that
only
means
another
week
and
there
she
blows
a

of

mingled
with
the
velvet
from

there
came
a

and
squared

to

when
wrenched
from

by

shook
him
into

and
into
a
portion
of
his
clothes
with
a
storm
of
excited

the

had
neither

out
into
the
surf
on
the
crest
of
a
roller
a
few
lifting
heaves
and
they
were
over
the
bar
with
the
men
at
the
oars
bending
the
white
ash
at
every
swing
i
guess
i
didn
t
forget
anything
gasped
wheaton
as
he
put
on
his
coat
i
got
ready
yesterday
but
i
couldn
t
find
you
last
night
so
i
thought
the
deal
was
glenister
stripped
off
his
coat
and
facing
the
bow
pushed
upon
the
oars
at
every
stroke
thus
adding
his
strength
to
that
of
the
oarsmen
they
crept
rapidly
out
from
the
beach
eating
up
the
two
miles
that
lay
towards
the
ship
he
urged
the
men
with
all
his
power
till
the
sweat
soaked
through
their
clothes
and
under
their
clinging
shirts
the
muscles
stood
out
like
iron
they
had
covered
half
the
distance
when
wheaton
uttered
a
cry
and
glenister
desisted
from
his
work
with
a
curse
the
was
moving
slowly
the
rowers
rested
but
the
young
man
shouted
at
them
to
begin
again
and
seizing
a
stuck
it
into
the
arms
of
his
coat
he
waved
this
on
high
while
the
men
redoubled
their
efforts
for
many
moments
they
hung
in
suspense
watching
the
black
hull
as
it
gathered
speed
and
then
as
they
were
about
to
cease
their
effort
a
puff
of
steam
burst
from
its
whistle
and
the
next
moment
a
short
toot
of
recognition
reached
them
glenister
wiped
the
moisture
from
his
brow
and
grinned
at
wheaton
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
as
they
lay
heaving
below
the
ship
s
steel
sides
he
thrust
a
heavy
buckskin
sack
into
the
lawyer
s
hand
there
s
money
to
win
the
fight
bill
i
don
t
know
how
much
but
it
s
enough
god
bless
you
hurry
back
a
sailor
cast
them
a
whirling
rope
up
which
wheaton
clambered
then
tying
the
gripsack
to
its
end
they
sent
it
after
important
the
young
man
yelled
at
the
officer
on
the
bridge
government
he
heard
a
muffled
clang
in
the
the
thrash
of
the
propellers
followed
and
the
big
ship
glided
past
as
glenister
dragged
himself
up
the
beach
upon
landing
helen
chester
called
to
him
and
made
room
for
him
beside
her
it
had
never
been
necessary
to
call
him
to
her
side
before
and
equally
unfamiliar
was
the
abashment
or
perhaps
physical
weariness
that
led
the
young
man
to
sink
back
in
the
warm
sand
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
noted
that
for
the
first
time
the
audacity
was
gone
from
his
eyes
i
watched
your
race
she
began
it
was
very
exciting
and
i
cheered
for
he
smiled
quietly
what
made
you
keep
on
after
the
ship
started
i
should
have
given
up
and
i
never
give
up
anything
that
i
want
he
said
have
you
never
been
forced
to
then
it
is
because
you
are
a
man
women
have
to
sacrifice
a
great
helen
expected
him
to
continue
to
the
effect
that
he
would
never
give
her
up
it
was
in
accordance
with
his
earlier
presumption
but
he
was
silent
and
she
was
not
sure
that
she
liked
him
as
well
thus
as
when
he
overwhelmed
her
with
the
boldness
of
his
suit
for
glenister
it
was
delightful
after
the
perils
of
the
night
to
rest
in
the
calm
of
her
presence
and
to
feel
dumbly
that
she
was
near
she
saw
him
secretly
caress
a
fold
of
her
dress
if
only
she
had
not
the
memory
of
that
one
night
on
the
ship
still
he
is
trying
to
make
amends
in
the
best
way
he
can
she
thought
though
of
course
no
woman
could
care
for
a
man
who
would
do
such
a
yet
she
thrilled
at
the
thought
of
how
he
had
thrust
his
body
between
her
and
danger
how
but
for
his
quick
insistent
action
she
would
have
failed
in
escaping
from
the
pest
ship
failed
in
her
mission
and
met
death
on
the
night
of
her
landing
she
owed
him
much
did
you
hear
what
happened
to
the
good
ship
she
asked
no
i
ve
been
too
busy
to
inquire
i
was
told
the
health
officers
quarantined
her
when
she
arrived
that
s
she
was
sent
to
egg
island
with
every
one
aboard
she
has
been
there
more
than
a
month
now
and
may
not
get
away
this
what
a
disappointment
for
the
poor
devils
on
her
yes
and
only
for
what
you
did
i
should
be
one
of
them
helen
remarked
i
didn
t
do
much
he
said
the
fighting
part
is
easy
it
s
not
half
so
hard
as
to
give
up
your
property
and
lie
still
while
did
you
do
that
because
i
asked
you
to
because
i
asked
you
to
put
aside
the
old
ways
a
wave
of
compassion
swept
over
her
certainly
he
answered
it
didn
t
come
easy
but
oh
i
thank
you
said
she
i
know
it
is
all
for
the
best
uncle
arthur
wouldn
t
do
anything
wrong
and
mcnamara
is
an
honorable
he
turned
towards
her
to
speak
but
refrained
he
could
not
tell
her
what
he
felt
certain
of
she
believed
in
her
own
blood
and
in
her
uncle
s
friends
and
it
was
not
for
him
to
speak
of
mcnamara
the
rules
of
the
game
sealed
his
lips
she
was
thinking
again
if
only
you
had
not
acted
as
you
she
longed
to
help
him
now
in
his
trouble
as
he
had
helped
her
but
what
could
she
do
the
law
was
such
a
confusing
intricate
perplexing
thing
i
spent
last
night
at
the
midas
she
told
him
and
rode
back
early
this
morning
that
was
a
daring
wasn
t
it
what
why
haven
t
you
heard
the
news
no
he
answered
steadily
i
just
got
your
claim
was
robbed
three
men
overcame
the
watchman
at
midnight
and
cleaned
the
his
simulation
of
excited
astonishment
was
perfect
and
he
rained
a
shower
of
questions
upon
her
she
noted
with
approval
that
he
did
not
look
her
in
the
eye
however
he
was
not
an
accomplished
liar
now
mcnamara
had
a
countenance
of
iron
unconsciously
she
made
comparison
and
the
young
man
at
her
side
did
not
lose
thereby
yes
i
saw
it
all
she
concluded
after
recounting
the
details
the
negro
wanted
to
bind
me
so
that
i
couldn
t
give
the
alarm
but
his
chivalry
prevented
he
was
a
most
gallant
what
did
you
do
when
they
left
why
i
kept
my
word
and
waited
until
they
were
out
of
sight
then
i
roused
the
camp
and
set
mcnamara
and
his
men
right
after
them
down
the
the
gulch
spoke
glenister
off
his
guard
yes
of
course
did
you
think
they
went
she
was
looking
squarely
at
him
now
and
he
dropped
his
eyes
no
the
posse
started
in
that
direction
but
i
put
them
there
was
an
odd
light
in
her
glance
and
he
felt
the
blood
drumming
in
his
ears
she
sent
them
so
that
was
why
there
had
been
no
pursuit
then
she
must
suspect
she
must
know
everything
glenister
was
stunned
again
his
love
for
the
girl
surged
tumultuously
within
him
and
demanded
expression
but
miss
chester
no
longer
feeling
sure
that
she
had
the
situation
in
hand
had
already
started
to
return
to
the
hotel
i
saw
the
men
distinctly
she
told
him
before
they
separated
and
i
could
identify
them
at
his
own
house
glenister
found
dextry
removing
the
stains
of
the
night
s
adventure
miss
chester
recognized
us
last
night
he
announced
how
do
you
know
she
told
me
so
just
now
and
what
s
more
she
sent
mcnamara
and
his
crowd
down
the
creek
instead
of
up
that
s
why
we
got
away
so
well
well
ain
t
she
a
brick
she
s
even
with
us
now
i
wonder
how
much
we
cleaned
up
anyhow
let
s
weigh
going
to
the
bed
dextry
turned
back
the
blankets
exposing
four
sacks
wet
and
heavy
where
he
had
thrown
them
there
must
have
been
twenty
thousand
dollars
with
what
i
gave
wheaton
said
glenister
at
that
moment
without
warning
the
door
was
flung
open
and
as
the
young
man
jerked
the
blankets
into
place
he
whirled
snatched
the
that
dextry
had
discarded
and
covered
the
entrance
don
t
shoot
boy
cried
the
breathlessly
my
but
you
re
nervous
glenister
dropped
his
gun
it
was
cherry
malotte
and
from
her
heaving
breast
and
the
flying
colors
in
her
cheeks
the
men
saw
she
had
been
running
she
did
not
give
them
time
to
question
but
closed
and
locked
the
door
while
the
words
came
tumbling
from
her
they
re
on
to
you
boys
you
d
better
duck
out
quick
they
re
on
their
way
up
here
what
who
quick
i
heard
mcnamara
and
voorhees
the
marshal
talking
somebody
has
spotted
you
for
the
they
re
on
their
way
now
i
tell
you
i
sneaked
out
by
the
back
way
and
came
here
through
the
mud
say
but
i
m
a
sight
she
stamped
her
trimly
booted
feet
and
flirted
her
skirt
i
don
t
savvy
what
you
mean
said
dextry
glancing
at
his
partner
warningly
we
ain
t
done
nothin
well
it
s
all
right
then
i
took
a
long
chance
so
you
could
make
a
if
you
wanted
to
because
they
ve
got
warrants
for
you
for
that
sluice
robbery
last
night
here
they
are
she
darted
to
the
window
the
men
peering
over
her
shoulder
coming
up
the
narrow
walk
they
saw
voorhees
mcnamara
and
three
others
the
house
stood
somewhat
isolated
and
well
back
on
the
tundra
so
that
any
one
approaching
it
by
the
planking
had
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
premises
escape
was
impossible
for
the
back
door
led
out
into
the
puddles
of
the
open
prairie
and
it
was
now
apparent
that
a
sixth
man
had
made
a
circuit
and
was
approaching
from
the
rear
my
god
they
ll
search
the
place
said
dextry
and
the
men
looked
grimly
in
each
other
s
faces
then
in
a
flash
glenister
stripped
back
the
blankets
and
seized
the
pokes
leaping
into
the
back
room
in
another
instant
he
returned
with
them
and
faced
desperately
the
candid
bareness
of
the
little
room
that
they
lived
and
slept
in
nothing
could
be
hidden
it
was
folly
to
think
of
it
there
was
a
loft
overhead
he
remembered
hopefully
then
realized
that
the
pursuers
would
search
there
first
of
all
i
told
you
he
was
a
hard
fighter
said
dextry
as
the
quick
footsteps
grew
louder
he
ain
t
no
fool
illustration
in
an
instant
the
four
sacks
were
dropped
softly
into
the
feathery
bottom
neither
stead
of
our
bein
caught
in
the
mountains
i
reckon
we
ll
shoot
it
out
here
we
should
have
cached
that
gold
he
spun
the
cylinder
of
his
blackened
colt
while
his
face
grew
hard
and
meanwhile
cherry
malotte
watched
the
hunted
look
in
glenister
s
face
grow
wilder
and
then
stiffen
into
the
stubbornness
of
a
man
at
bay
the
posse
was
at
the
door
now
knocking
the
three
inside
stood
rigid
and
strained
then
glenister
tossed
his
burden
on
the
bed
go
into
the
back
room
cherry
there
s
going
to
be
who
s
there
inquired
dextry
through
the
door
to
gain
time
suddenly
without
a
word
the
girl
glided
to
the
heater
now
cold
and
empty
which
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
these
stoves
used
widely
in
the
north
are
vertical
iron
cylinders
into
which
coal
is
poured
from
above
she
lifted
the
lid
and
peered
in
to
find
it
a
quarter
full
of
dead
ashes
then
turned
with
shining
eyes
and
parted
lips
to
glenister
he
caught
the
hint
and
in
an
instant
the
four
sacks
were
dropped
softly
into
the
feathery
bottom
and
the
ashes
raked
over
the
daring
manœuvre
was
almost
as
quick
as
the
flash
of
woman
s
wit
that
prompted
it
and
was
carried
through
while
the
answer
to
dextry
s
question
was
still
unspoken
then
glenister
opened
the
door
carelessly
and
admitted
the
group
of
men
we
ve
got
a
to
look
through
your
house
said
voorhees
what
are
you
looking
for
from
anvil
all
right
search
they
rapidly
scoured
the
premises
covering
every
inch
paying
no
heed
to
the
girl
who
watched
them
with
indifferent
eyes
nor
to
the
old
man
who
glared
at
their
every
movement
glenister
was
carelessly
sarcastic
although
he
kept
his
right
arm
free
while
beneath
his
was
a
thoroughly
trained
alertness
mcnamara
directed
the
search
with
a
manner
wholly
lacking
in
his
former
mock
courtesy
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
soured
by
the
gall
of
defeat
the
mask
had
fallen
off
now
and
his
character
showed
insistent
overbearing
cruel
towards
the
partners
he
preserved
a
contemptuous
silence
the
invaders
ransacked
thoroughly
while
a
dozen
times
the
hearts
of
cherry
malotte
and
her
two
companions
stopped
then
lunged
onward
as
mcnamara
or
voorhees
approached
then
passed
the
stove
at
last
voorhees
lifted
the
lid
and
peered
into
its
dark
interior
at
the
same
instant
the
girl
cried
out
sharply
flinging
herself
from
her
position
while
the
marshal
jerked
his
head
back
in
time
to
see
her
dash
upon
dextry
don
t
don
t
she
cried
her
appeal
to
the
old
man
keep
cool
you
ll
be
sorry
dex
they
re
almost
the
officer
had
not
seen
any
movement
on
dextry
s
part
but
doubtless
her
quick
eye
had
detected
signs
of
violence
mcnamara
emerged
glowering
from
the
back
room
at
that
moment
let
them
hunt
the
girl
was
saying
while
dextry
stared
dazedly
over
her
head
they
won
t
find
anything
keep
cool
and
don
t
act
voorhees
s
duties
sat
uncomfortably
upon
him
at
the
best
and
looking
at
the
smouldering
eyes
of
the
two
men
he
became
averse
to
further
search
in
a
powdery
household
whose
members
itched
to
shoot
him
in
the
back
it
isn
t
here
he
reported
but
the
politician
only
scowled
then
spoke
for
the
first
time
directly
to
the
partners
i
ve
got
warrants
for
both
of
you
and
i
m
tempted
to
take
you
in
but
i
won
t
i
m
not
through
yet
not
by
any
means
i
ll
get
you
get
you
he
turned
out
of
the
door
followed
by
the
marshal
who
called
off
his
guards
and
the
group
filed
back
along
the
walk
say
you
re
a
jewel
cherry
you
ve
saved
us
twice
you
caught
voorhees
just
in
time
my
heart
hit
my
palate
when
he
looked
into
that
stove
but
the
next
instant
i
wanted
to
laugh
at
dextry
s
impulsively
glenister
laid
his
hands
upon
her
shoulders
at
his
look
and
touch
her
throat
swelled
her
bosom
heaved
and
the
silken
lids
fluttered
until
she
seemed
choked
by
a
very
flood
of
sweet
womanliness
she
blushed
like
a
little
maid
and
laughed
a
timid
broken
laugh
then
pulling
herself
together
the
merry
careless
tone
came
into
her
voice
and
her
cheeks
grew
cool
and
clear
you
wouldn
t
trust
me
at
first
eh
some
day
you
ll
find
that
your
old
friends
are
the
best
after
and
as
she
left
them
she
added
mockingly
say
you
re
a
pair
of
shine
desperadoes
you
need
a
chapter
xi
wherein
a
writ
and
a
riot
fail
a
raw
gray
day
with
a
driving
drizzle
from
seaward
and
a
leaden
rack
of
clouds
drifting
low
matched
the
sullen
fitful
mood
of
glenister
during
the
last
month
he
had
chafed
and
fretted
like
an
animal
in
leash
for
word
of
wheaton
this
uncertainty
this
impotent
waiting
with
folded
hands
was
maddening
to
one
of
his
spirit
he
could
apply
himself
to
no
fixed
duty
for
the
sense
of
his
wrong
preyed
on
him
fiercely
and
he
found
himself
haunting
the
vicinity
of
the
midas
gazing
at
it
from
afar
grasping
hungrily
for
such
scraps
of
news
as
chanced
to
reach
him
mcnamara
allowed
access
to
none
but
his
minions
so
the
partners
knew
but
vaguely
of
what
happened
on
their
property
even
though
under
fiction
of
law
it
was
being
worked
for
their
protection
no
steps
regarding
a
speedy
hearing
of
the
case
were
allowed
and
the
collusion
between
judge
stillman
and
the
receiver
had
become
so
generally
recognized
that
there
were
uneasy
mutterings
and
threats
in
many
quarters
yet
although
the
politician
had
by
now
virtually
absorbed
all
the
richest
properties
in
the
district
and
worked
them
through
his
hirelings
the
people
of
nome
as
a
whole
did
not
grasp
the
full
turpitude
of
the
scheme
nor
the
system
s
perfect
working
strange
to
say
dextry
the
had
assumed
an
oriental
patience
quite
foreign
to
his
peppery
disposition
and
spent
much
of
his
time
in
the
hills
prospecting
on
this
day
as
the
clouds
broke
about
noon
close
down
on
the
angry
horizon
a
drift
of
smoke
appeared
shortly
resolving
itself
into
a
steamer
she
lay
to
in
the
offing
and
through
his
glasses
glenister
saw
that
it
was
the
as
the
hours
passed
and
no
boat
put
off
he
tried
to
hire
a
crew
but
the
longshoremen
spat
wisely
and
shook
their
heads
as
they
watched
the
surf
there
s
the
devil
of
an
undertow
settin
along
this
beach
they
told
him
and
the
water
s
too
cold
to
drownd
in
so
he
laid
firm
hands
upon
his
impatience
every
day
meant
many
dollars
to
the
watcher
and
yet
it
seemed
that
nature
was
resolute
in
thwarting
him
for
that
night
the
wind
freshened
and
daylight
saw
the
ship
hugging
the
lee
of
sledge
island
miles
to
the
westward
while
the
surf
white
as
boiling
milk
boomed
and
thundered
against
the
shore
word
had
gone
through
the
street
that
bill
wheaton
was
aboard
with
a
writ
or
a
subpœna
or
an
alibi
or
whatever
was
necessary
to
put
the
kibosh
on
mcnamara
so
public
excitement
grew
mcnamara
hoarded
his
gold
in
the
alaska
bank
and
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
there
would
lie
the
scene
of
the
struggle
no
one
supposed
for
an
instant
that
the
usurper
would
part
with
the
treasure
peaceably
on
the
third
morning
the
ship
lay
abreast
of
the
town
again
and
a
was
seen
to
make
off
from
her
whereupon
the
idle
population
streamed
towards
the
beach
she
ll
make
it
to
the
surf
all
right
but
then
watch
we
d
better
make
ready
to
haul
em
out
said
another
it
s
mighty
and
sure
enough
as
the
skiff
came
rushing
in
through
the
breakers
she
was
caught
she
had
made
it
past
the
first
line
soaring
over
the
bar
on
a
foamy
like
a
gull
winging
in
towards
the
land
the
wiry
figure
of
bill
wheaton
crouched
in
the
stern
while
two
sailors
fought
with
their
oars
as
they
gathered
for
their
rush
through
the
last
zone
of
froth
a
great
comber
rose
out
of
the
sea
behind
them
rearing
high
above
their
heads
the
crowd
at
the
surf
s
edge
shouted
the
boat
wavered
sucked
back
into
the
ocean
s
angry
maw
and
with
a
crash
the
deluge
engulfed
them
there
remained
nothing
but
a
swirling
flood
through
which
the
emerged
bottom
up
amid
a
tangle
of
oars
gratings
and
gear
men
rushed
into
the
water
and
the
next
roller
pounded
them
back
upon
the
sand
there
came
the
sound
of
splitting
wood
and
then
a
group
swarmed
in
and
bore
out
a
dripping
figure
it
was
a
seaman
who
shook
the
water
from
his
mane
and
grinned
when
his
breath
had
come
a
step
farther
down
the
beach
the
seized
a
limp
form
which
the
tide
rolled
to
them
it
was
the
second
sailor
his
scalp
split
from
a
blow
of
the
gunwale
nowhere
was
wheaton
glenister
had
plunged
to
the
rescue
first
a
about
his
middle
and
although
buffeted
about
he
had
reached
the
wreck
only
to
miss
sight
of
the
lawyer
utterly
he
had
time
for
but
a
glance
when
he
was
drawn
outward
by
the
undertow
till
the
line
at
his
waist
grew
taut
then
the
water
surged
over
him
and
he
was
hurled
high
up
on
the
beach
again
he
staggered
dizzily
back
to
the
struggle
when
suddenly
a
wave
lifted
the
capsized
cutter
and
righted
it
and
out
from
beneath
shot
the
form
of
wheaton
grimly
clutching
the
they
brought
him
in
choking
and
breathless
i
got
it
he
said
slapping
his
streaming
breast
it
s
all
right
glenister
i
knew
what
delay
meant
so
i
took
a
long
chance
with
the
the
terrific
ordeal
he
had
undergone
had
blanched
him
to
the
lips
his
legs
wabbled
uncertainly
and
he
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
young
man
who
thrust
an
arm
about
his
waist
and
led
him
up
into
the
town
i
went
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
frisco
he
explained
later
and
they
issued
orders
allowing
an
appeal
from
this
court
and
gave
me
a
writ
of
supersedeas
directed
against
old
judge
stillman
that
takes
the
litigation
out
of
his
hands
altogether
and
directs
mcnamara
to
turn
over
the
midas
and
all
the
gold
he
s
got
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
did
better
than
i
glenister
wrung
his
hand
silently
while
a
great
satisfaction
came
upon
him
at
last
this
waiting
was
over
and
his
peaceful
yielding
to
injustice
had
borne
fruit
had
proven
the
better
course
after
all
as
the
girl
had
prophesied
he
could
go
to
her
now
with
clean
hands
the
mine
was
his
again
he
would
lay
it
at
her
feet
telling
her
once
more
of
his
love
and
the
change
it
was
working
in
him
he
would
make
her
see
it
make
her
see
that
beneath
the
harshness
his
years
in
the
wild
had
given
him
his
love
for
her
was
gentle
and
true
and
he
would
bid
her
be
patient
till
she
saw
he
had
mastered
himself
till
he
could
come
with
his
soul
in
harness
i
am
glad
i
didn
t
fight
when
they
jumped
us
he
said
now
we
ll
get
our
property
back
and
all
the
money
they
took
out
that
is
if
mcnamara
hasn
t
salted
yes
all
that
s
necessary
is
to
file
the
documents
then
serve
the
judge
and
mcnamara
you
ll
be
back
on
anvil
creek
having
placed
their
documents
on
record
at
the
the
two
men
continued
to
mcnamara
s
office
he
met
them
with
courtesy
i
heard
you
had
a
narrow
escape
this
morning
wheaton
too
bad
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
lawyer
rapidly
outlined
his
position
and
stated
in
conclusion
i
filed
certified
copies
of
these
orders
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
ten
minutes
ago
and
now
i
make
formal
demand
upon
you
to
turn
over
the
midas
to
glenister
and
dextry
and
also
to
return
all
the
in
your
boxes
in
accordance
with
this
he
handed
his
documents
to
mcnamara
who
tossed
them
on
his
desk
without
examination
well
said
the
politician
quietly
i
won
t
do
had
he
been
slapped
in
the
face
the
attorney
would
not
have
been
more
astonished
why
you
i
won
t
do
it
i
said
mcnamara
repeated
sharply
don
t
think
for
a
minute
that
i
haven
t
gone
into
this
fight
armed
for
everything
writs
of
supersedeas
bah
he
snapped
his
fingers
we
ll
see
whether
you
ll
obey
or
not
said
wheaton
and
when
he
and
glenister
were
outside
he
continued
let
s
get
to
the
judge
as
they
neared
the
golden
gate
hotel
they
spied
mcnamara
entering
it
was
evident
that
he
had
slipped
from
the
rear
door
of
his
office
and
beaten
them
to
the
judicial
ear
i
don
t
like
that
said
glenister
he
s
up
to
so
it
appeared
for
they
were
fifteen
minutes
in
gaining
access
to
the
magistrate
and
then
found
mcnamara
with
him
both
men
were
astounded
at
the
change
in
stillman
s
appearance
during
the
last
month
his
weak
face
had
shrunk
and
altered
until
vacillation
was
betrayed
in
every
line
and
he
had
acquired
the
habit
of
furtively
watching
mcnamara
s
slightest
movement
it
seemed
that
the
part
he
played
sat
heavily
upon
him
the
judge
examined
the
papers
perfunctorily
and
although
his
air
was
deliberate
his
fingers
made
clumsy
work
of
it
at
last
he
said
i
regret
that
i
am
forced
to
doubt
the
authenticity
of
these
my
heavens
man
wheaton
cried
they
re
certified
copies
of
orders
from
your
superior
court
they
grant
the
appeal
that
you
have
denied
us
and
take
the
case
out
of
your
hands
altogether
yes
and
they
order
this
man
to
surrender
the
mine
and
everything
connected
with
it
now
sir
we
want
you
to
enforce
these
stillman
glanced
at
the
silent
man
in
the
window
and
replied
you
will
of
course
proceed
regularly
and
make
application
in
court
in
the
proper
way
but
i
tell
you
now
that
i
won
t
do
anything
in
the
wheaton
stared
at
him
fixedly
until
the
old
man
snapped
out
you
say
they
are
certified
copies
how
do
i
know
they
are
the
signatures
may
all
be
false
maybe
you
signed
them
the
lawyer
grew
very
white
at
this
and
stammered
until
glenister
drew
him
out
of
the
room
come
come
he
said
we
ll
carry
this
thing
through
in
open
court
maybe
his
nerve
will
go
back
on
him
then
mcnamara
has
him
hypnotized
but
he
won
t
dare
refuse
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
circuit
court
of
he
won
t
eh
well
what
do
you
think
he
s
doing
right
now
said
wheaton
i
must
think
this
is
the
boldest
game
i
ever
played
in
they
told
me
things
while
i
was
in
frisco
which
i
couldn
t
believe
but
i
guess
they
re
true
judges
don
t
disobey
the
orders
of
their
courts
of
appeal
unless
there
is
power
back
of
they
proceeded
to
the
attorney
s
office
but
had
not
been
there
long
before
slapjack
simms
burst
in
upon
them
hell
to
pay
he
panted
mcnamara
s
taking
your
dust
out
of
the
what
s
that
they
cried
i
goes
into
the
bank
just
now
for
an
assay
on
some
quartz
samples
the
assayer
is
busy
and
i
walk
back
into
his
room
and
while
i
m
there
in
trots
mcnamara
in
a
hurry
he
don
t
see
me
as
i
m
inside
the
private
office
and
i
overhear
him
tell
them
to
get
his
dust
out
of
the
vault
we
ve
got
to
stop
that
said
glenister
if
he
takes
ours
he
ll
take
the
swedes
too
simms
you
run
up
to
the
pioneer
company
and
tell
them
about
it
if
he
gets
that
gold
out
of
there
nobody
knows
what
ll
become
of
it
come
on
he
snatched
his
hat
and
ran
out
of
the
room
followed
by
the
others
that
the
slapjack
did
his
work
with
expedition
was
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
swedes
were
close
upon
their
heels
as
the
two
entered
the
bank
others
had
followed
sensing
something
unusual
and
the
space
within
the
doors
filled
rapidly
at
the
disturbance
the
clerks
suspended
their
work
the
barred
doors
of
the
vault
clanged
to
and
the
cashier
laid
hand
upon
the
navy
colt
s
at
his
elbow
what
s
the
matter
he
cried
we
want
alec
mcnamara
said
glenister
the
manager
of
the
bank
appeared
and
glenister
spoke
to
him
through
the
heavy
wire
netting
is
mcnamara
in
there
no
one
had
ever
known
morehouse
to
lie
yes
he
spoke
hesitatingly
in
a
voice
full
of
the
slow
music
of
virginia
he
is
in
here
what
of
it
we
hear
he
s
trying
to
move
that
dust
of
ours
and
we
won
t
stand
for
it
tell
him
to
come
out
and
not
hide
in
there
like
a
at
these
words
the
politician
appeared
beside
the
southerner
and
the
two
conversed
softly
an
instant
while
the
impatience
of
the
crowd
grew
to
anger
some
one
cried
let
s
go
in
and
drag
him
out
and
the
rumble
at
this
was
not
pleasant
morehouse
raised
his
hand
gentlemen
mcnamara
says
he
doesn
t
intend
to
take
any
of
the
gold
then
he
s
taken
it
no
he
hasn
the
receiver
s
course
had
been
quickly
chosen
at
the
interruption
it
was
not
wise
to
anger
these
men
too
much
although
he
had
planned
to
get
the
money
into
his
own
possession
he
now
thought
it
best
to
leave
it
here
for
the
present
he
could
come
back
at
any
time
when
they
were
off
guard
and
get
it
beyond
the
door
against
which
he
stood
lay
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
weighed
sacked
sealed
and
ready
to
move
out
of
the
custody
of
this
virginian
whose
confidence
he
had
tried
so
fruitlessly
to
gain
as
mcnamara
looked
into
the
angry
eyes
of
the
men
beyond
the
grating
he
felt
that
the
game
was
growing
close
and
his
blood
tingled
at
the
thought
he
had
not
planned
on
a
resistance
so
strong
and
swift
but
he
would
meet
it
he
knew
that
they
hungered
for
his
destruction
and
that
glenister
was
their
leader
he
saw
further
that
the
man
s
hatred
now
stared
at
him
openly
for
the
first
time
he
knew
that
back
of
it
was
something
more
than
love
for
the
dull
metal
over
which
they
wrangled
and
then
a
thought
came
to
him
some
of
your
work
eh
glenister
he
mocked
were
you
afraid
to
come
alone
or
did
you
wait
till
you
saw
me
with
a
lady
at
the
same
instant
he
opened
a
door
behind
him
revealing
helen
chester
you
d
better
not
walk
out
with
me
miss
chester
this
man
might
well
you
re
safer
here
you
know
you
ll
pardon
me
for
leaving
he
hoped
he
could
incite
the
young
man
to
some
rash
act
or
word
in
the
presence
of
the
girl
and
counted
on
the
conspicuous
heroism
of
his
own
position
facing
the
mob
one
against
fifty
come
out
said
his
enemy
hoarsely
upon
whom
the
insult
and
the
sight
of
the
girl
in
the
receiver
s
company
had
acted
powerfully
of
course
i
ll
come
out
but
i
don
t
want
this
young
lady
to
suffer
any
violence
from
your
friends
said
mcnamara
i
am
not
armed
but
i
have
the
right
to
leave
here
unmolested
the
right
of
an
american
with
that
he
raised
his
arms
above
his
head
out
of
my
way
he
cried
morehouse
opened
the
gate
and
mcnamara
strode
through
the
mob
it
is
a
peculiar
thing
that
although
under
fury
of
passion
a
man
may
fire
even
upon
the
back
of
a
defenceless
foe
yet
no
one
can
offer
violence
to
a
man
whose
arms
are
raised
on
high
and
in
whose
glance
is
the
level
light
of
fearlessness
moreover
it
is
safer
to
face
a
crowd
thus
than
a
single
adversary
mcnamara
had
seen
this
psychological
trick
tried
before
and
now
took
advantage
of
it
to
walk
through
the
press
slowly
eye
to
eye
he
did
it
theatrically
for
the
benefit
of
the
girl
and
as
he
foresaw
the
men
fell
away
before
him
all
but
glenister
who
blocked
him
gun
in
hand
it
was
plain
that
the
persecuted
miner
was
beside
himself
with
passion
mcnamara
came
within
an
arm
before
pausing
then
he
stopped
and
the
two
stared
malignantly
at
each
other
while
the
girl
behind
the
railing
heard
her
heart
pounding
in
the
stillness
glenister
raised
his
hand
uncertainly
then
let
it
fall
he
shook
his
head
and
stepped
aside
so
that
the
other
brushed
past
and
out
into
the
street
wheaton
addressed
the
banker
mr
morehouse
we
ve
got
orders
and
writs
of
one
kind
or
another
from

circuit

of
appeals

directing
that
this
money
be
turned
over

shoved
the

a
mood
to

at

come

on

the

his

those
grim

outside
there
stood
brawny
men
with
set

and
frowning
faces
and
scandinavians
in
whose
blue
eyes
danced
the
flame
of
battle
these
had
been
baffled
at

turn
goaded
by
repeated
failure

now
stood
shoulder

in
their
resistance
to
a
cruel

the

glenister
had
said
that
the
judge
would
not
dare
to
disobey
the
mandates
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
he
was
wrong
application
was
made
for
orders
directing
the
enforcement
of
the

which
would
have
restored
possession
of
the

to
its
owners
as
well
as

but
stillman
refused
to

wheaton
called
a
meeting
of
the
swedes
and
their
attorneys
advising
a
junction
of
forces
dextry
who
had
returned
from
the
mountains
was
present
when
they
had
finished
their
discussion
he
said
it
seems
like
i
can
always
fight
better
when
i
know
what
the
other
feller
s
game
is
i
m
going
to
spy
on
that
we
ve
had
detectives
at
work
for
weeks
said
the
lawyer
for
the
scandinavians
but
they
can
t
find
out
anything
we
don
t
know
dextry
said
no
more
but
that
night
found
him
busied
in
the
building
adjoining
the
one
wherein
mcnamara
had
his
office
he
had
rented
a
back
room
on
the
top
floor
and
with
the
help
of
his
partner
sawed
through
the
ceiling
into
the
loft
and
found
his
way
thence
to
the
roof
through
a
hatchway
fortunately
there
was
but
little
space
between
the
two
buildings
and
furthermore
each
boasted
the
square
fronts
common
in
which
projected
high
enough
to
prevent
observation
from
across
the
way
thus
he
was
enabled
without
discovery
to
gain
the
roof
adjoining
and
to
cut
through
into
the
loft
he
crept
cautiously
in
through
the
opening
and
out
upon
a
floor
of
joists
sealed
on
the
lower
side
then
lit
a
candle
and
locating
mcnamara
s
office
cut
a
so
that
by
lying
flat
on
the
timbers
he
could
command
a
considerable
portion
of
the
room
beneath
here
early
the
following
morning
he
camped
with
the
patience
of
an
indian
emerging
in
the
still
of
that
night
stiff
hungry
and
atrociously
cross
meanwhile
there
had
been
another
meeting
of
the
and
it
had
been
decided
to
send
wheaton
properly
armed
with
affidavits
and
transcripts
of
certain
court
records
back
to
san
francisco
on
the
return
trip
of
the
which
had
arrived
in
port
he
was
to
institute
proceedings
for
contempt
of
court
and
it
was
hoped
that
by
extraordinary
effort
he
could
gain
quick
action
at
daybreak
dextry
returned
to
his
post
and
it
was
midnight
before
he
crawled
from
his
to
see
the
lawyer
and
glenister
they
have
had
a
spy
on
you
all
day
wheaton
he
began
and
they
know
you
re
going
out
to

you

be
arrested

before

what

don

what
the

bigamy
or

or
attainder
of

or
something
anyway
they
ll
get
you
in
jail
and
that
s
all
they
want
they
think
you
re
the
only
lawyer
that

wise
enough
to
cause
trouble
and
the
only
one
they
can
t
lord
what

i
do
they

that

the

a

how

together
and

ready

i
tell

protested
the
lawyer
but
dextry
had
gone
better
do
as
he
says
his
schemes
are
good
ones
recommended
glenister
and
accordingly
the
lawyer
made
preparation
in
the
mean
time
the
old
prospector
had
begun
at
the
end
of
front
street
to
make
a
systematic
search
of
the
although
it
was
very
late
they
were
running
noisily
and
at
last
he
found
the
man
he
wanted
playing
black
jack
the
smell
of
tar
in
his
clothes
the
lilt
of
the
sea
in
his
boisterous
laughter
dextry
drew
him
aside
mac
there
s
only
two
things
about
you
that

any
good
your
silence
and
your
seamanship
otherwise

if
it

or

or
the
side

old

next
turned
his
steps
to
the
northern
theatre
the
performance
was
still
in
progress
and
he
located
the
man
he
was
hunting
without
difficulty
ascending
the
stairs
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
one
of
the
boxes
and

back
into
his
stall
dextry
returned
to
wheaton
s
office
as
he
neared
it
he
passed
a
lounging
figure
in
an
adjacent
doorway

he
announced
as
he
entered
have
you
got
a
back

leave
your
light
burning
and
we
ll
go
out

they
slipped
quietly
into
an
inky
tortuous
passage
which
led
back
towards
second
street
floundering
through
alleys
and
over
garbage
heaps
by
circuitous
routes
they
reached
the
bridge
where
in
the
swift
stream
beneath
they
saw
the
lights
from
mac
s
tug
steam
was
up
and
when
the
captain
had
let
them
aboard
dextry
gave
him
instructions
to
which
he
nodded
acquiescence
they
bade
the
lawyer
adieu
and
the
little
craft
slipped
its
moorings
danced
down
the
current
across
the
bar
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
darkness
to
seaward

put

they

he

gone

room
extinguished
his
light
went
to
their
own
cabin
and
to
bed
at
dawn
glenister
arose
and
sought
his
place
above
mcnamara
s
office
to
lie
stretched
at
length
on
a
single
plank
with
eye
glued
to
a
crack
is
not
a
comfortable
position
and
the
watcher
thought
the
hours
of
the
next
day
would
never
end
as
they
dragged
wearily
past
his
bones
began
to
ache
beyond
endurance
yet
owing
to
the
flimsy
structure
of
the
building
he
dared
not
move
while
the
room
below
was
tenanted
in
fact
he
would
not
have
stirred
had
he
dared
so
intense
was
his
interest
in
the
scenes
being
enacted
beneath
him
first
had
come
the
marshal
who
reported
his
failure
to
find
wheaton
he
left
his
room
some
time
last
night
my
men
followed
him
in
and
saw
a
light
in
his
window
until
two
o
clock
this
morning
at
seven
o
clock
we
broke
in
and
he
was
he
must
have
got
wind
of
our
plan
send
deputies
aboard
the
search
her
from
keel
to
and
have
them
watch
the
beach
close
or
he
ll
put
off
in
a
small
boat
you
look
over
the
passengers
that
go
aboard
yourself
don
t
trust
any
of
your
men
for
that
because
he
may
try
to
slip
through
disguised
he
s
liable
to
make
up
like
a
woman
you
understand
there
s
only
one
ship
in
port
and
he
mustn
t
get

won

conviction

the
listener
overhead
smiled
grimly
to
himself
for
at
that
moment
twenty
miles
offshore
lay
mac

little
tug
hove
to
in
the
track
of
the
outgoing
steamship
and
in
her
tiny
cabin
sat
bill
wheaton
eating
breakfast
as
the
morning
wore
by
with
no
news
of
the
lawyer
mcnamara
s
uneasiness
grew
at
noon
the
marshal
returned
with
a
report
that
the
passengers
were
all
aboard
and
the
ship
about
to
clear
by
heavens
he
s
slipped
through
you
stormed
the
politician
no
he
hasn
t
he
may
be
hidden
aboard
somewhere
among
the
but
i
think
he
s
still
ashore
and
aiming
to
make
a
quick
run
just
before
she
sails
he
hasn
t
left
the
beach
since
daylight
that
s
sure
i
m
going
out
to
the
ship
now
with
four
men
and
search
her
again
if
we
don
t
bring
him
off
you
can
bet
he
s
lying
out
somewhere
in
town
and
we
ll
get
him
later
i
ve
stationed
men
along
the
shore
for
two

have
him

grinned
into
a
sandwich
then
turned
upon
his
back
and
lay
thus
on
the
plank
identifying
the
speakers
below
by
their
voices
he
kept
his
post
all
day
later
in
the
evening
he
heard
struve
enter
the
man
had
been
drinking
so
he
got
away
eh
he
began

was
afraid
he
would

he
didn

said
mcnamara
he

me
land
him
in

on
some
excuse
i
ll
hold
him
till

into

a
dangerous
thing

glenister
felt
a
sudden
tightening
of
every
muscle
what
right
had
that
man
s
lips
to
speak
so
of
her
she
s
a
brave
little
woman
all
right
just
look
how
she
worked
glenister
and
his
fool
partner
it
took
nerve
to
bring
in
those
instructions
of
yours
alone
and
if
it
hadn

been
for
her
we
d
never
have
won
like
this
it
makes
me
laugh
to
think
of
those
two
men
stowing
her
away
in
their
while
they
slept
between
decks
with
the
sheep
and
her
with
the
papers
in
her
bosom
all
the
time
then
when
we
got
ready
to
do
business
why
she
up
and
talks
them
into
giving
us
possession
of
their
mine
without
a
fight
that
s
what
i
call
reciprocating
a
man
s
glenister
s
nails
cut
into
his
flesh
while
his
face
went
livid
at
the
words
he
could
not
grasp
it
at
once
it
made
him
sick
physically
sick
and
for
many
moments
he
strove
blindly
to
beat
back
the
hideous
suspicion
the
horror
that
the
lawyer
had
aroused
his
was
not
a
doubting
disposition
and
to
him
the
girl
had
seemed
as
one
pure
mysterious
apart
angelically
incapable
of
deceit
he
had
loved
her
feeling
that
some
day
she
would
return
his
affection
without
fail
in
her
great
unclouded
eyes
he
had
found
no
for
now
god
it
couldn
t
be
that
all
the
time
she
had
he
had
lost
a
part
of
the
lawyer
s
speech
but
peered
through
his
again
mcnamara
was
at
the
window
gazing
out
into
the
dark
street
his
back
towards
the
lawyer
who
lolled
in
the
chair
babbling
garrulously
of
the
girl
glenister
ground
his
teeth
a
frenzy
possessed
him
to
loose
his
anger
to
rip
through
the
frail
ceiling
with
naked
hands
and
fall
vindictively
upon
the
two
men
she
looked
good
to
me
the
first
time
i
saw
her
continued
struve
he
paused
and
when
he
spoke
again
a
change
had
coarsened
his
features
say
i
m
crazy
about
her
mac
i
tell
you
i
m
crazy
and
she
likes
me
i
know
she
does
or
anyway
she
would
do
you
mean
that
you
re
in
love
with
her
asked
the
man
at
the
window
without
shifting
his
position
it
seemed
that
utter
indifference
was
in
his
question
although
where
the
light
shone
on
his
hands
behind
his
back
they
were
bloodless
love
her
well
that
depends
ha
you
know
how
it
is
he
chuckled
coarsely
his
face
was
gross
and
bestial
i
ve
got
the
judge
where
i
want
him
and
i
ll
have
her
his
miserable
words
died
with
a
gurgle
for
mcnamara
had
silently
leaped
and
throttled
him
where
he
sat
pinning
him
to
the
wall
glenister
saw
the
big
politician
shift
his
fingers
slightly
on
struve
s
throat
and
then
drop
his
left
hand
to
his
side
holding
his
victim
writhing
and
helpless
with
his
right
despite
the
man
s
frantic
struggles
mcnamara
s
head
was
thrust
forward
from
his
shoulders
peering
into
the
lawyer
s
face
struve
tore
ineffectually
at
the
iron
arm
which
was
squeezing
his
life
out
while
for
endless
minutes
the
other
leaned
his
weight
against
him
his
idle
hand
behind
his
back
his
legs
braced
like
stone
columns
as
he
watched
his
victim
s
struggles
abate
struve
fought
and
wrenched
while
his
breath
caught
in
his
throat
with
horrid
sickening
sounds
but
gradually
his
eyes
rolled
farther
and
farther
back
till
they
stared
out
of
his
blackened
visage
straight
up
towards
the
ceiling
towards
the
hole
through
which
glenister
peered
his
struggles
lessened
his
chin
sagged
and
his
tongue
protruded
then
he
sat
loose
and
still
the
politician
flung
him
out
into
the
room
so
that
he
fell
limply
upon
his
face
then
stood
watching
him
finally
mcnamara
passed
out
of
the
watcher
s
vision
returning
with
a
with
his
foot
he
rolled
the
unconscious
wretch
upon
his
back
then
drenched
him
replacing
the
pail
he
seated
himself
lit
a
cigar
and
watched
the
return
of
life
into
his
victim
he
made
no
move
even
to
drag
him
from
the
pool
in
which
he
lay
struve
groaned
and
shuddered
twisted
to
his
side
and
at
last
sat
up
weakly
in
his
eyes
there
was
now
a
great
terror
while
in
place
of
his
drunkenness
was
only
fear
and
faintness
abject
fear
of
the
great
bulk
that
sat
and
smoked
and
stared
at
him
so
fishily
he
felt
uncertainly
of
his
throat
and
groaned
again
why
did
you
do
that
he
whispered
but
the
other
made
no
sign
he
tried
to
rise
but
his
knees
relaxed
he
staggered
and
fell
at
last
he
gained
his
feet
and
made
for
the
door
then
when
his
hand
was
on
the
knob
mcnamara
spoke
through
his
teeth
without
removing
his
cigar
don
t
ever
talk
about
her
again
she
is
going
to
marry
when
he
was
alone
he
looked
curiously
up
at
the
ceiling
over
his
head
the
rats
are
thick
in
this
shack
he
mused
seems
to
me
i
heard
a
whole
swarm
of
a
few
moments
later
a
figure
crept
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
of
the
house
next
door
and
thence
down
into
the
street
a
block
ahead
was
the
form
of
attorney
struve
had
a
stranger
met
them
both
he
would
not
have
known
which
of
the
two
had
felt
at
his
throat
the
clutch
of
a
strangler
for
each
was
drawn
and
haggard
and
swayed
as
he
went
glenister
unconsciously
turned
towards
his
cabin
but
at
leaving
the
lighted
streets
the
thought
of
its
darkness
and
silence
made
him
shudder
not
now
he
could
not
bear
that
stillness
and
the
company
of
his
thoughts
he
dared
not
be
alone
dextry
would
be
undoubtedly
and
he
too
must
get
into
the
light
and
turmoil
he
licked
his
lips
and
found
that
they
were
cracked
and
dry
at
rare
intervals
during
the
past
years
he
had
staggered
in
from
a
long
march
where
for
hours
he
had
waged
a
bitter
war
with
cold
and
hunger
his
limbs
clumsy
with
fatigue
his
garments
wet
and
stiff
his
mind
slack
and
sullen
at
such
extreme
seasons
he
had
felt
a
consuming
thirst
a
thirst
which
burned
and
scorched
until
his
very
bones
cried
out
feverishly
not
a
thirst
for
water
nor
a
thirst
which
eaten
snow
could
quench
but
a
savage
yearning
of
his
whole
exhausted
system
for
some
stimulant
for
some
coursing
fiery
fluid
that
would
burn
and
strangle
a
thirst
for
whiskey
for
brandy
remembering
these
occasional
ferocious
desires
he
had
become
charitable
to
such
unfortunates
as
were
too
weak
to
withstand
similar
temptations
now
with
a
shock
he
caught
himself
in
the
grip
of
a
thirst
as
insistent
as
though
the
cold
bore
down
and
the
weariness
of
endless
heavy
miles
wrapped
him
about
it
was
no
foolish
wish
to
drown
his
thoughts
nor
to
banish
the
grief
that
preyed
upon
him
but
only
thirst
thirst
a
crying
trembling
physical
lust
to
quench
the
fires
that
burned
inside
he
remembered
that
it
had
been
more
than
a
year
since
he
had
tasted
whiskey
now
the
fever
of
the
past
few
hours
had
parched
his
every
tissue
as
he
elbowed
in
through
the
crowd
at
the
northern
those
next
him
made
room
at
the
bar
for
they
recognized
the
hunger
that
peers
thus
from
men
s
faces
their
manner
recalled
glenister
to
his
senses
and
he
wrenched
himself
away
this
was
not
some
solitary
he
would
not
stand
and
soak
himself
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
stevedores
and
longshoremen
this
was
something
to
be
done
in
secret
he
had
no
pride
in
it
the
man
on
his
right
raised
a
glass
and
the
young
man
strangled
a
madness
to
tear
it
from
his
hands
instead
he
hurried
back
to
the
theatre
and
up
to
a
box
where
he
drew
the
curtains
whiskey
he
said
thickly
to
the
waiter
bring
it
to
me
fast
don
t
you
hear
whiskey
across
the
theatre
cherry
malotte
had
seen
him
enter
and
jerk
the
curtains
together
she
arose
and
went
to
him
entering
without
ceremony
what
s
the
matter
boy
she
questioned
ah
i
am
glad
you
came
talk
to
thank
you
for
your
few
remarks
she
laughed
why
don
t
you
ask
me
to
spring
some
good
original
jokes
you
look
like
the
finish
to
a
what
s
up
she
talked
to
him
for
a
moment
until
the
waiter
entered
then
when
she
saw
what
he
bore
she
snatched
the
glass
from
the
tray
and
poured
the
whiskey
on
the
floor
glenister
was
on
his
feet
and
had
her
by
the
wrist
what
do
you
mean
he
said
roughly
it
s
whiskey
boy
she
cried
and
you
don
t
of
course
it
s
whiskey

me
another
he
shouted
at
the
attendant
what
s
the
matter
cherry
insisted
i
never
saw
you
act
so
you
know
you
don
t
drink
i
won
t
let
you
it
s
booze
booze

tell
you

for
fools
and
brawlers

t
drink

roy
are

i
say
i

and
i
will
have
it
how
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
smoulder
inside
and
feel
your
veins
burn
dry
it
s
something
about
that
girl
the
woman
said
with
quiet
conviction
she
s
well
so
she
has
but
what
of
it
i
m
thirsty
she
s
going
to
marry
mcnamara
i
ve
been
a
he
ground
his
teeth
and
reached
for
the
drink
with
which
the
boy
had
returned
mcnamara
is
a
crook
but
he
s
a
man
and
he
never
drank
a
drop
in
his
the
girl
said
it
casually
evenly
but
the
other
stopped
the
glass
to
his
lips
well
what
of
it
go
on
you
re
good
at
talk
virtue
becomes
she
flushed
but
continued
it
simply
occurred
to
me
that
if
you
aren
t
strong
enough
to
handle
your
own
throat
you
re
not
strong
enough
to
beat
a
man
who
has
mastered
glenister
looked
at
the
whiskey
a
moment
then
set
it
back
on
the
tray
bring
two
lemonades
he
said
and
with
a
laugh
which
was
half
a
sob
cherry
malotte
leaned
forward
and
kissed
him
you
re
too
good
a
man
to
drink
now
tell
me
all
about
oh
it
s
too
long
i
ve
just
learned
that
the
girl
is
in
hand
and
glove
with
the
judge
and
mcnamara
that
s
all
she
s
an
advance
agent
their
lookout
she
brought
in
their
instructions
to
struve
and
persuaded
dex
and
me
to
let
them
jump
our
claim
she
got
us
to
trust
in
the
law
and
in
her
uncle
yes
she
hypnotized
my
property
out
of
me
and
gave
it
to
her
lover
this
ward
politician
oh
she
s
smooth
with
all
her
innocence
why
when
she
smiles
she
makes
you
glad
and
good
and
warm
and
her
eyes
are
as
honest
and
clear
as
a
mountain
pool
but
she
s
wrong
she
s
wrong
and
great
god
how
i
love
her
he
dropped
his
face
into
his
hands
when
she
had
pled
with
him
for
himself
a
moment
before
cherry
malotte
was
genuine
and
girlish
but
now
as
he
spoke
thus
of
the
other
woman
a
change
came
over
her
which
he
was
too
disturbed
to
note
she
took
on
the
subtleness
that
masked
her
as
a
rule
and
her
eyes
were
not
pleasant
i
could
have
told
you
all
that
and
more
what
more
he
questioned
do
you
remember
when
i
warned
you
and
dextry
that
they
were
coming
to
search
your
cabin
for
the
gold
well
that
girl
put
them
on
to
you
i
found
it
out
afterwards
she
keeps
the
keys
to
mcnamara
s
safety
vault
where
your
dust
lies
and
she
s
the
one
who
handles
the
judge
it
isn
t
mcnamara
at
the
woman
lied
easily
fluently
and
the
man
believed
her
do
you
remember
when
they
broke
into
your
safe
and
took
that
money
well
what
made
them
think
you
had
ten
thousand
in
there
i
don
t
i
do
dextry
told
glenister
arose
that
s
all
i
want
to
hear
now
i
m
going
crazy
my
mind
aches
for
i
ve
never
had
a
fight
like
this
before
and
it
hurts
you
see
i
ve
been
an
animal
all
these
years
when
i
wanted
to
drink
i
drank
and
what
i
wanted
i
got
because
i
ve
been
strong
enough
to
take
it
this
is
new
to
me
i
m
going
now
and
try
to
think
of
something
else
then
i
m
going
when
he
had
gone
she
pulled
back
the
curtains
and
leaning
her
chin
in
her
hands
with
elbows
on
the
ledge
gazed
down
upon
the
crowd
the
show
was
over
and
the
dance
had
begun
but
she
did
not
see
it
for
she
was
thinking
rapidly
with
the
eagerness
of
one
who
sees
the
end
of
a
long
and
weary
search
she
did
not
notice
the
bronco
kid
beckoning
to
her
nor
the
man
with
him
so
the
gambler
brought
his
friend
along
and
invaded
her
box
he
introduced
the
man
as
champian
do
you
feel
like
dancing
the
inquired
no
i
d
rather
look
on
i
feel
sociable
you
re
a
society
man
champian
don
t
you
know
anything
of
interest
scandal
or
the
like
can
t
say
that
i
do
my
wife
attends
to
all
that
for
the
family
but
i
know
there
s
lots
of
it
it
s
funny
to
me
the
airs
some
of
these
people
assume
up
here
just
as
though
we
weren
t
all
equal
north
of
i
never
heard
the
anything
new
and
exciting
inquired
bronco
mildly
interested
the
last
i
heard
was
about
the
judge
s
niece
miss
cherry
malotte
turned
abruptly
while
the
kid
slowly
lowered
the
front
legs
of
his
chair
to
the
floor
what
was
it
she
inquired
why
it
seems
she
compromised
herself
pretty
badly
with
this
fellow
glenister
coming
up
on
the
steamer
last
spring
mighty
brazen
according
to
my
wife
champian
was
on
the
same
ship
and
says
she
was
horribly
ah
glenister
had
told
her
only
half
the
tale
thought
the
girl
the
truth
was
baring
itself
at
that
moment
champian
thought
she
looked
the
typical
creature
of
the
the
crafty
jealous
malevolent
adventuress
and
the
hussy
masquerades
as
a
lady
she
sneered
she
a
lady
said
the
kid
he
sat
bolt
upright
and
rigid
and
the
knuckles
of
his
clinched
hands
were
very
white
in
the
shadow
they
did
not
note
that
his
dark
face
was
ghastly
nor
did
he
say
more
except
to
bid
champian
when
he
left
later
on
after
the
door
had
closed
however
the
kid
arose
and
stretched
his
muscles
not
languidly
but
as
though
to
take
out
the
cramp
of
long
tension
he
wet
his
lips
and
his
mouth
was
so
dry
that
the
sound
caused
the
girl
to
look
up
what
are
you
grinning
at
then
as
the
light
struck
his
face
she
started
my
how
you
look
what
ails
you
are
you
sick
no
one
from
dawson
down
had
seen
the
bronco
kid
as
he
looked
no
i
m
not
sick
he
answered
in
a
cracked
voice
then
the
girl
laughed
harshly
do
love
that
girl
too
why
she
s
got
every
man
in
town
she
wrung
her
hands
which
is
a
bad
sign
in
a
capable
person
and
as
glenister
crossed
the
floor
below
in
her
sight
she
said
i
could
kill
him
for
that
so
could
i
said
the
kid
and
left
her
without
adieu
chapter
xiii
in
which
a
man
is
possessed
of
a
devil
for
a
long
time
cherry
malotte
sat
quietly
thinking
removed
by
her
mental
stress
to
such
an
infinite
distance
from
the
music
and
turmoil
beneath
that
she
was
conscious
of
it
only
as
a
formless
clamor
she
had
tipped
a
chair
back
against
the
door
wedging
it
beneath
the
knob
so
that
she
might
be
saved
from
interruption
then
flung
herself
into
another
seat
and
stared
unseeingly
as
she
sat
thus
and
thought
and
schemed
harsh
and
hateful
lines
seemed
to
eat
into
her
face
now
and
then
she
moaned
impatiently
as
though
fearing
lest
the
strategy
she
was
plotting
might
prove
futile
then
she
would
rise
and
pace
her
narrow
quarters
she
was
unconscious
of
time
and
had
spent
perhaps
two
hours
thus
when
amid
the
buzz
of
talk
in
the
next
compartment
she
heard
a
name
which
caused
her
to
start
listen
then
drop
her
preoccupation
like
a
mantle
a
man
was
speaking
of
glenister
excitement
thrilled
his
voice
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
since
mcmaster
s
night
in
virginia
city
thirteen
years
ago
he
s
well
perhaps
so
the
other
replied
doubtfully
but
i
don
t
care
to
back
you
i
never
staked
a
man
in
my
then
me
the
money
i
ll
pay
it
back
in
an
hour
but
for
heaven
s
sake
be
quick
i
tell
you
he
s
as
right
as
a
golden
guinea
it
s
the
lucky
night
of
his
life
why
he
turned
over
the
black
jack
game
in
four
bets
in
fifteen
minutes
more
we
can
t
get
close
enough
to
a
table
to
send
in
our
money
with
a
every
sport
in
camp
will
be
i
ll
stake
you
to
fifty
the
second
man
replied
in
a
tone
that
showed
a
trace
of
his
companion
s
excitement
so
glenister
was
gambling
the
girl
learned
and
with
such
luck
as
to
break
the
black
jack
game
and
excite
the
greed
of
every
gambler
in
camp
news
of
his
winnings
had
gone
out
into
the
street
and
the
sporting
men
were
coming
to
share
his
fortune
to
fatten
like
vultures
on
the
adversity
of
their
fellows
those
who
had
no
money
to
stake
were
borrowing
like
the
man
next
door
she
left
her
retreat
and
descending
the
stairs
was
greeted
by
a
strange
sight
the
was
empty
of
all
but
the
musicians
who
blew
and
fiddled
lustily
in
vain
endeavor
to
draw
from
the
rapidly
swelling
crowd
that
thronged
the
and
stretched
to
the
door
the
press
was
thickest
about
a
table
midway
down
the
hall
cherry
could
see
nothing
of
what
went
on
there
for
men
and
women
stood
ten
deep
about
it
and
others
perched
on
chairs
and
tables
along
the
walls
a
roar
arose
suddenly
followed
by
utter
silence
then
came
the
clink
and
rattle
of
silver
a
moment
and
the
crowd
resumed
its
laughter
and
talk
all
down
boys
sounded
the
level
voice
of
the
dealer
the
field
or
the
favorite
he
s
made
eighteen
straight
passes
get
your
money
on
the
there
ensued
another
breathless
instant
wherein
she
heard
the
thud
of
dice
then
followed
the
shout
of
triumph
that
told
what
the
spots
revealed
the
dealer
payed
off
glenister
reared
himself
head
and
shoulders
above
the
others
and
pushed
out
through
the
ring
to
the
the
rest
followed
behind
the
circular
table
they
had
quitted
the
dealer
was
putting
away
his
dice
and
there
was
not
a
coin
in
his
rack
mexico
mullins
approached
cherry
and
she
questioned
him
he
just
broke
the
crap
game
mullins
told
her
nineteen
passes
without
losing
the
how
much
did
he
win
oh
he
didn
t
win
much
himself
but
it
s
the
people
betting
with
him
that
does
the
damage
they
re
gamblers
most
of
them
and
they
play
the
limit
he
took
out
the
black
jack
first
then
cleaned
the
by
that
time
the
tin
horns
began
to
come
in
it
s
the
greatest
run
i
ever
did
you
get
in
now
don
t
you
know
that
i
never
play
anything
but
bank
if
he
lasts
long
enough
to
reach
the
faro
i
ll
get
the
excitement
of
the
crowd
began
to
infect
the
girl
even
though
she
looked
on
from
the
outside
the
exultant
voices
the
sudden
hush
the
tensity
of
nerve
it
all
betokened
set
her
a
stranger
left
the
throng
and
rushed
to
the
spot
where
cherry
and
mexico
stood
talking
he
was
small
and
sandy
with
shifting
glance
and
chinless
jaw
his
eyes
glittered
his
teeth
shone
ratlike
through
his
dry
lips
and
his
voice
was
shrill
he
darted
towards
them
like
some
furtive
frightened
little
animal
unnaturally
excited
i
guess
that
isn
t
so
bad
for
three
bets
he
shook
a
sheaf
of
at
them
why
don
t
you
stick
inquired
mullins
i
am
too
wise
ha
i
know
when
to
quit
he
can
t
win
steady
he
don
t
play
any
then
he
has
a
good
chance
said
the
girl
there
he
goes
now
the
little
man
cried
as
the
uproar
arose
i
told
you
he
d
at
the
voice
of
the
multitude
he
wavered
as
though
affected
by
some
powerful
magnet
but
he
won
again
said
mexico
no
did
he
lord
i
quit
too
soon
he
scampered
back
into
the
other
room
only
to
return
hesitating
his
money
tightly
clutched
do
you
s
pose
it
s
safe
i
never
saw
a
man
bet
so
reckless
i
guess
i
d
better
quit
eh
he
noted
the
sneer
on
the
woman
s
face
and
without
waiting
a
reply
dashed
off
again
they
saw
him
clamorously
fight
his
way
in
towards
a
post
at
the
let
me
through
i
ve
got
money
and
i
want
to
play
it
pah
said
mullins
disgustedly
he
s
one
of
them
vermont
desperadoes
that
never
laid
a
bet
till
he
was
thirty
if
glenister
loses
he
ll
hate
him
for
there
are
plenty
of
his
sort
here
the
girl
remarked
his
soul
would
fit
in
a
she
spied
the
bronco
kid
sauntering
back
towards
her
and
joined
him
he
leaned
against
the
wall
watching
the
gossamer
thread
of
smoke
twist
upward
from
his
cigarette
seemingly
oblivious
to
the
surroundings
and
showing
no
hint
of
the
emotion
he
had
displayed
two
hours
before
this
is
a
big
killing
isn
t
it
said
the
girl
the
gambler
nodded
murmuring
indifferently
why
aren
t
you
dealing
bank
isn
t
this
your
shift
i
quit
last
just
in
time
to
miss
this
affair
lucky
for
yes
i
own
the
place
now
bought
it
good
heavens
then
it
s
money
he
s
sure
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
a
she
glanced
at
the
long
trail
of
devastated
tables
behind
glenister
and
his
followers
at
that
instant
the
sound
told
that
the
miner
had
won
again
and
it
dawned
upon
cherry
that
the
gambler
beside
her
stood
too
quietly
that
his
hand
and
voice
were
too
steady
his
glance
too
cold
to
be
natural
the
next
moment
approved
her
instinct
the
musicians
grown
tired
of
their
endeavors
to
lure
back
the
dancers
determined
to
join
the
excitement
and
ceased
playing
the
leader
laid
down
his
violin
the
pianist
trailed
up
the
with
a
departing
twitter
and
quit
his
stool
they
all
crossed
the
hall
headed
for
the
crowd
some
of
them
making
ready
to
bet
as
they
approached
the
bronco
kid
his
lips
thinned
and
slid
apart
slightly
while
out
of
his
eyes
there
flared
unreasoning
rage
stepping
forward
he
seized
the
foremost
man
and
spun
him
about
violently
where
are
you
going
why
nobody
wants
to
dance
so
we
thought
we
d
go
out
front
for
a
get
back
damn
you
it
was
his
first
chance
to
vent
the
passion
within
him
a
glance
at
his
maddened
features
was
sufficient
for
the
musicians
and
they
did
not
delay
by
the
time
they
had
resumed
their
duties
however
the
curtains
of
composure
had
closed
upon
the
kid
masking
his
emotion
again
but
from
her
brief
glimpse
cherry
malotte
knew
that
this
man
was
not
of
ice
as
some
supposed
he
turned
to
her
and
said
do
you
mean
what
you
said
i
don
t
you
said
you
could
kill
i
don
t
you
love
i
him
she
interrupted
hoarsely
he
gave
her
a
mirthless
smile
and
spying
the
leaving
his
bankrupt
table
called
him
over
and
said
toby
i
want
you
to
drive
the
hearse
when
glenister
begins
to
play
faro
i
ll
deal
understand
sure
going
to
give
him
a
little
work
eh
i
never
dealt
a
crooked
card
in
this
camp
exclaimed
the
kid
but
i
ll
lay
that
man
or
i
ll
kill
him
i
ll
use
a
see
and
i
want
to
explain
my
signals
to
you
if
you
miss
the
signs
you
ll
queer
us
both
and
put
the
house
on
the
he
rapidly
rehearsed
his
signals
in
a
jargon
which
to
a
layman
would
have
been
unintelligible
illustrating
them
by
certain
almost
imperceptible
shiftings
of
the
fingers
or
changes
in
the
position
of
his
hand
so
slight
as
to
thwart
discovery
through
it
all
the
girl
stood
by
and
followed
his
every
word
and
motion
with
eager
attention
she
needed
no
explanation
of
the
terms
they
used
she
knew
them
all
knew
that
the
was
the
man
who
kept
the
cases
knew
all
the
code
of
the
inside
to
her
it
was
all
as
an
open
page
and
she
memorized
more
quickly
than
did
toby
the
signs
by
which
the
bronco
kid
proposed
to
signal
what
card
he
had
smuggled
from
the
box
or
held
back
in
faro
it
is
customary
for
the
to
sit
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
from
the
dealer
with
a
device
before
him
resembling
an
abacus
or
chinese
when
a
card
is
removed
from
the
by
the
dealer
the
moves
a
button
opposite
a
corresponding
card
on
his
little
machine
in
order
that
the
players
at
a
glance
may
tell
what
spots
have
been
played
or
are
still
in
the
box
his
duties
though
simple
are
important
for
should
he
make
an
error
and
should
the
position
of
his
counters
not
tally
with
the
cards
in
the
box
on
the
last
turn
all
bets
on
the
table
are
declared
void
when
honestly
dealt
faro
is
the
fairest
of
all
gambling
games
but
it
is
intricate
and
may
hide
much
knavery
when
the
game
is
crooked
it
is
fatal
for
out
of
the
ingenuity
of
generations
of
card
sharks
there
have
been
evolved
a
multitude
of
devices
with
which
to
fleece
the
unsuspecting
these
are
so
carefully
masked
that
none
but
the
initiated
may
know
them
while
the
freemasonry
of
the
craft
is
strong
and
discovery
unusual
instead
of
using
a
familiar
arrangement
like
the
wherein
an
invisible
needle
pricks
the
dealer
s
thumb
thus
signalling
the
presence
of
certain
cards
the
bronco
kid
had
determined
to
use
the
in
other
words
he
would
employ
a
straight
box
but
a
deck
of
cards
certain
ones
of
which
had
been
roughened
or
slightly
so
that
by
pressing
more
heavily
on
the
top
or
exposed
card
the
one
beneath
would
stick
to
its
neighbor
above
and
thus
enable
him
to
deal
two
with
one
motion
if
the
occasion
demanded
this
roughness
would
likewise
enable
him
to
detect
the
hidden
presence
of
a
marked
card
by
the
faintest
scratching
sound
when
he
dealt
in
this
manipulation
it
would
be
necessary
also
to
shave
the
edges
of
some
of
the
pasteboards
a
trifle
so
that
when
the
deck
was
forced
firmly
against
one
side
of
the
box
there
would
be
exposed
a
fraction
of
the
small
figure
in
the
corner
of
the
concealed
cards
long
practice
in
the
art
of
jugglery
lends
such
proficiency
as
to
baffle
discovery
and
rob
the
game
of
its
uncertainty
as
surely
as
the
player
is
robbed
of
his
money
it
is
of
course
vital
that
the
confederate
be
able
to
interpret
the
dealer
s
signs
perfectly
in
order
to
move
the
sliding
ebony
disks
to
correspond
else
trouble
will
accrue
at
the
completion
of
the
hand
when
the
cases
come
out
wrong
having
completed
his
instructions
the
proprietor
went
forward
and
cherry
wormed
her
way
towards
the
she
wished
to
watch
glenister
but
could
not
get
near
him
because
of
the
crowd
the
men
would
not
make
room
for
her
every
eye
was
glued
upon
the
table
as
though
salvation
lurked
in
its
rows
of
red
and
black
they
were
packed
behind
it
until
the
croupier
had
barely
room
to
spin
the
ball
and
although
he
forced
them
back
they
pressed
forward
again
inch
by
inch
drawn
by
the
song
of
the
ivory
drunk
with
its
worship
maddened
by
the
breath
of
chance
cherry
gathered
that
glenister
was
still
winning
for
a
glimpse
of
the
between
the
shoulders
of
those
ahead
showed
that
the
checks
were
nearly
out
of
it
plainly
it
was
but
a
question
of
minutes
so
she
backed
out
and
took
her
station
beside
the
where
the
bronco
kid
was
dealing
his
face
wore
its
colorless
mask
of
indifference
his
long
white
hands
moved
slowly
with
the
certainty
that
betokened
absolute
mastery
of
his
art
he
was
waiting
the
dealer
was
keeping
cases
the
group
left
the
in
a
few
moments
and
surrounded
her
glenister
among
the
others
he
was
not
the
man
she
knew
in
place
of
the
dreary
hopelessness
with
which
he
had
left
her
his
face
was
flushed
and
reckless
his
collar
was
open
showing
the
base
of
his
great
corded
neck
while
the
lust
of
the
game
had
coarsened
him
till
he
was
again
the
violent
untamed
primitive
man
of
the
frontier
his
and
dignity
were
gone
he
had
tried
the
new
ways
and
they
were
not
for
him
he
slipped
back
and
the
past
swallowed
him
after
leaving
cherry
he
had
sought
some
mental
relief
by
idly
risking
the
silver
in
his
pocket
he
had
let
the
coins
lie
and
double
then
double
again
and
again
he
had
been
indifferent
whether
he
won
or
lost
so
assumed
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
laws
of
probability
thinking
that
he
would
shortly
lose
the
money
he
had
won
and
then
go
home
he
did
not
want
it
when
his
luck
remained
the
same
he
raised
the
stakes
but
it
did
not
change
he
could
not
lose
before
he
realized
it
other
men
were
betting
with
him
animated
purely
by
greed
and
craze
of
the
sport
first
one
then
another
joined
till
game
after
game
was
closed
and
each
moment
the
crowd
had
grown
in
size
and
enthusiasm
so
that
its
fever
crept
into
him
imperceptibly
at
first
but
ever
increasing
till
the
mania
mastered
him
he
paid
no
attention
to
cherry
as
he
took
his
seat
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
the
she
clenched
her
hands
and
prayed
for
his
ruin
what
s
your
limit
kid
he
inquired
one
hundred
and
two
the
kid
answered
which
in
the
vernacular
means
that
any
sum
up
to
may
be
laid
on
one
card
save
only
on
the
last
turn
when
the
amount
is
lessened
by
half
without
more
ado
they
commenced
the
kid
handled
his
cards
smoothly
surely
paying
and
taking
bets
with
calm
the
ceased
talking
and
prepared
to
watch
for
now
came
the
crucial
test
of
the
evening
faro
is
to
other
games
as
war
is
to
jackstraws
for
a
time
glenister
won
steadily
till
there
came
a
moment
when
many
stacks
of
chips
lay
on
the
deuce
cherry
saw
the
kid
flash
to
the
and
the
next
moment
he
had
pulled
the
deuce
lost
it
was
his
first
substantial
gain
and
the
players
paid
no
attention
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
winnings
were
slightly
in
favor
of
the
then
glenister
said
this
is
too
slow
i
want
all
right
smiled
the
proprietor
we
ll
double
the
thus
it
became
possible
to
wager
on
a
card
and
the
kid
began
really
to
play
glenister
now
lost
steadily
not
in
large
amounts
but
with
tantalizing
regularity
cherry
had
never
seen
cards
played
like
this
the
gambler
was
a
revelation
to
her
his
work
was
wonderful
ill
luck
seemed
to
fan
the
crowd
s
eagerness
while
to
add
to
its
impatience
the
cases
came
wrong
twice
in
succession
so
that
those
who
would
have
bet
heavily
upon
the
last
turn
had
their
money
given
back
cherry
saw
the
confusion
of
the
even
quicker
than
did
bronco
toby
was
growing
rattled
the
dealer
s
work
was
too
fast
for
him
and
yet
he
could
offer
no
signal
of
distress
for
fear
of
annihilation
at
the
hands
of
those
crowded
close
to
his
shoulder
in
the
same
way
the
owner
of
the
game
could
make
no
objection
to
his
helper
s
incompetence
for
fear
that
some
would
volunteer
to
fill
the
man
s
part
there
were
many
present
capable
of
the
trick
he
could
only
glare
balefully
across
the
table
at
his
unfortunate
confederate
they
had
not
gone
far
on
the
next
game
before
cherry
s
quick
eye
detected
a
sign
which
the
man
misinterpreted
she
addressed
him
quietly
you
d
better
brush
up
your
in
spite
of
his
anger
the
bronco
kid
smiled
humor
in
him
was
strangely
withered
and
distorted
yet
here
was
a
thrust
he
would
always
remember
and
recount
with
glee
in
years
to
come
he
feared
there
were
other
present
who
might
understand
the
hint
but
there
was
none
save
mexico
mullins
whose
face
was
a
study
mirth
seemed
to
be
strangling
him
a
moment
later
the
girl
spoke
to
the
again
let
me
take
your
place
your
reins
are
toby
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
kid
who
caught
cherry
s
reassuring
look
and
nodded
so
he
arose
and
the
girl
slid
into
the
vacant
chair
this
woman
would
make
no
errors
the
dealer
knew
that
her
keen
wits
were
sharpened
by
hate
it
showed
in
her
face
if
glenister
escaped
destruction
it
would
be
because
human
means
could
not
accomplish
his
downfall
in
the
mind
of
the
new
there
was
but
one
thought
roy
must
be
broken
humiliation
disgrace
ruin
ridicule
were
to
be
his
if
he
should
be
downed
discredited
and
discouraged
then
perhaps
he
would
turn
to
her
as
he
had
in
the
days
he
was
slipping
away
from
her
this
was
her
last
chance
she
began
her
duties
easily
and
her
alertness
stimulated
bronco
till
his
senses
too
grew
sharper
his
observation
more
acute
and
glenister
swore
beneath
his
breath
that
the
cards
were
bewitched
he
was
like
a
drunken
man
now
as
truly
intoxicated
as
though
the
fumes
of
wine
had
befogged
his
brain
he
swayed
in
his
seat
the
veins
of
his
neck
thickened
and
throbbed
his
features
were
congested
after
a
while
he
spoke
i
want
a
bigger
limit
is
this
some
boy
s
game
throw
her
the
gambler
shot
a
triumphant
glance
at
the
girl
and
acquiesced
all
right
the
limit
is
the
blue
sky
pile
your
checks
to
the
he
began
to
shuffle
within
the
crowded
circle
the
air
was
hot
and
fetid
with
the
breath
of
men
the
sweat
trickled
down
glenister
s
brown
skin
dripping
from
his
jaw
unnoticed
he
arose
and
ripped
off
his
coat
while
those
standing
behind
shifted
and
scuffed
their
feet
impatiently
besides
roy
there
were
but
three
men
playing
they
were
the
ones
who
had
won
heaviest
at
first
now
that
luck
was
against
them
they
were
loath
to
quit
cherry
was
annoyed
by
stertorous
breathing
at
her
shoulder
and
glanced
back
to
find
the
little
man
who
had
been
so
excited
earlier
in
the
evening
his
mouth
was
agape
his
eyes
wide
the
muscles
about
his
lips
twitching
he
had
lost
back
long
since
the
hundreds
he
had
won
and
more
besides
she
searched
the
figures
walling
her
about
and
saw
no
women
they
had
been
crowded
out
long
since
it
seemed
as
though
the
table
formed
the
bottom
of
a
sloping
pit
of
human
faces
eager
tense
staring
it
was
well
she
was
here
she
thought
else
this
task
might
fail
she
would
help
to
blast
glenister
desolate
him
humiliate
him
ah
but
wouldn
t
she
roy
bet
on
the
popular
card
on
the
third
turn
he
lost
he
bet
next
and
lost
he
set
out
a
stack
of
and
lost
for
the
third
time
fortune
had
turned
her
face
he
ground
his
teeth
and
doubled
until
the
stakes
grew
enormous
while
the
dealer
dealt
monotonously
the
spots
flashed
and
disappeared
taking
with
them
wager
after
wager
glenister
became
conscious
of
a
raging
red
fury
which
he
had
hard
shift
to
master
it
was
not
his
money
what
if
he
did
lose
he
would
stay
until
he
won
he
win
this
luck
would
not
could
not
last
and
yet
with
diabolic
persistence
he
continued
to
choose
the
losing
cards
the
other
men
fared
better
till
he
yielded
to
their
judgment
when
the
dealer
took
their
money
also
strange
to
say
the
fickle
goddess
had
really
shifted
her
banner
at
last
and
the
bronco
kid
was
dealing
straight
faro
now
he
was
too
good
a
player
to
force
a
winning
hand
and
glenister
s
became
as
phenomenal
as
his
winning
had
been
the
girl
who
figured
in
this
drama
was
keyed
to
the
highest
tension
her
eyes
now
on
her
counters
now
searching
the
profile
of
her
victim
glenister
continued
to
lose
and
lose
and
lose
while
the
girl
gloated
over
his
ruin
when
at
long
intervals
he
won
a
bet
she
shrank
and
shivered
for
fear
he
might
escape
if
only
he
would
risk
it
all
everything
he
had
he
would
have
to
come
to
her
then
the
end
was
closer
than
she
realized
the
throng
hung
breathless
upon
each
move
of
the
players
while
there
was
no
sound
but
the
noise
of
shifting
chips
and
the
distant
jangle
of
the
orchestra
the
lookout
sat
far
forward
upon
his
perch
his
hands
upon
his
knees
his
eyes
frozen
to
the
board
a
dead
cigar
clenched
between
his
teeth
crowded
upon
his
platform
were
miners
tense
and
motionless
as
statues
when
a
man
spoke
or
coughed
a
score
of
eyes
stared
at
him
accusingly
then
dropped
to
the
table
again
glenister
took
from
his
clothes
a
bundle
of
so
thick
that
it
required
his
two
hands
to
compass
it
saw
that
the
bills
were
mainly
yellow
no
one
spoke
while
he
counted
them
rapidly
glanced
at
the
dealer
who
nodded
then
slid
them
forward
till
they
rested
on
the
king
he
placed
a
copper
on
the
pile
a
great
sigh
of
indrawn
breaths
swept
through
the
crowd
the
north
had
never
known
a
bet
like
this
it
meant
a
fortune
here
was
a
tale
for
one
s
grandchildren
that
a
man
should
win
opulence
in
an
evening
then
lose
it
in
one
deal
this
final
bet
represented
more
than
many
of
them
had
ever
seen
at
one
time
before
its
fate
lay
on
a
single
card
cherry
malotte
s
fingers
were
like
ice
and
shook
till
the
buttons
of
her
rattled
her
heart
raced
till
she
could
not
breathe
while
something
rose
up
and
choked
her
if
glenister
won
this
bet
he
would
quit
she
felt
it
if
he
lost
ah
what
could
the
kid
there
feel
the
man
who
was
playing
for
a
paltry
vengeance
compared
to
her
whose
hope
of
happiness
of
love
of
life
hinged
on
this
wager
evidently
the
bronco
kid
knew
what
card
lay
next
below
for
he
offered
her
no
sign
and
as
glenister
leaned
back
he
slowly
and
firmly
pushed
the
top
card
out
of
the
box
although
this
was
the
biggest
turn
of
his
life
he
betrayed
no
tremor
his
gesture
displayed
the
nine
of
diamonds
and
the
crowd
breathed
heavily
the
king
had
not
won
would
it
lose
every
gaze
was
welded
to
the
tiny
nickelled
box
if
the
lay
next
beneath
the
the
heaviest
wager
in
alaska
would
have
been
lost
if
it
still
remained
hidden
on
the
next
turn
the
money
would
be
safe
for
a
moment
slowly
the
white
hand
of
the
dealer
moved
back
his
middle
finger
touched
the
nine
of
diamonds
it
slid
smoothly
out
of
the
box
and
there
in
its
place
frowned
the
king
of
clubs
at
last
the
silence
was
broken
men
spoke
some
laughed
but
in
their
laughter
was
no
mirth
it
was
more
like
the
sound
of
choking
they
stamped
their
feet
to
relieve
the
grip
of
strained
muscles
the
dealer
reached
forth
and
slid
the
stack
of
bills
into
the
drawer
at
his
waist
without
counting
the
passed
a
shaking
hand
over
her
face
and
when
it
came
away
she
saw
blood
on
her
fingers
where
she
had
sunk
her
teeth
into
her
lower
lip
glenister
did
not
rise
he
sat
and
sullen
his
jaw
thrust
forward
his
hair
low
upon
his
forehead
his
eyes
bloodshot
and
dead
i
ll
sit
the
hand
out
if
you
ll
let
me
bet
the
finger
said
he
certainly
replied
the
dealer
when
a
man
requests
this
privilege
it
means
that
he
will
call
the
amount
of
his
wager
without
producing
the
visible
stakes
and
the
dealer
may
accept
or
refuse
according
to
his
judgment
of
the
bettor
s
responsibility
it
is
safe
for
no
man
shirks
a
gambling
debt
in
the
north
and
thousands
may
go
with
a
nod
of
the
head
though
never
a
cent
be
on
the
board
there
were
still
a
few
cards
in
the
box
and
the
dealer
turned
them
paying
the
three
men
who
played
glenister
took
no
part
but
sat
bulked
over
his
end
of
the
table
glowering
from
beneath
his
shock
of
hair
cherry
was
deathly
tired
the
strain
of
the
last
hour
had
been
so
intense
that
she
could
barely
sit
in
her
seat
yet
she
was
determined
to
finish
the
hand
as
bronco
paused
before
the
last
turn
many
of
the
made
bets
they
were
the
who
risked
money
only
on
the
final
pair
thus
avoiding
the
chance
of
two
cards
of
like
denomination
coming
together
in
which
event
splits
it
is
called
the
dealer
takes
half
the
money
the
stakes
were
laid
at
last
and
the
deal
about
to
start
when
glenister
spoke
wait
what
s
this
place
worth
bronco
what
do
you
mean
you
own
this
outfit
he
waved
his
hand
about
the
room
well
what
does
it
stand
you
the
gambler
hesitated
an
instant
while
the
crowd
pricked
up
its
ears
and
the
girl
turned
wondering
troubled
eyes
upon
the
miner
what
would
he
do
now
counting
bank
rolls
fixtures
and
all
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
why
i
ll
pick
the
ace
to
lose
my
interest
in
the
midas
against
your
whole
damned
there
was
an
absolute
hush
while
the
realization
of
this
offer
smote
the
it
took
time
to
realize
it
this
man
was
insane
there
were
three
cards
to
choose
from
one
would
win
one
would
lose
and
one
would
have
no
action
of
all
those
present
only
cherry
malotte
divined
even
vaguely
the
real
reason
which
prompted
the
man
to
do
this
it
was
not
gameness
nor
altogether
a
brutish
stubbornness
which
would
not
let
him
quit
it
was
something
deeper
he
was
desolate
and
his
heart
was
gone
helen
was
lost
to
him
worse
yet
was
unworthy
and
she
was
all
he
cared
for
what
did
he
want
of
the
midas
with
its
lawsuits
its
intrigues
and
its
trickery
he
was
sick
of
it
all
of
the
whole
game
and
wanted
to
get
away
if
he
won
very
well
if
he
lost
the
land
of
the
aurora
would
know
him
no
more
when
he
put
his
proposition
the
bronco
kid
dropped
his
eyes
as
though
debating
the
girl
saw
that
he
studied
the
cards
in
his
box
intently
and
that
his
fingers
caressed
the
top
one
ever
so
softly
during
the
instant
the
eyes
of
the
rest
were
on
glenister
the
dealer
looked
up
at
last
and
cherry
saw
the
gleam
of
triumph
in
his
eye
he
could
not
mask
it
from
her
though
his
answering
words
were
hesitating
she
knew
by
the
look
that
glenister
was
a
pauper
come
on
insisted
roy
hoarsely
turn
the
you
re
on
the
girl
felt
that
she
was
fainting
she
wanted
to
scream
the
triumph
of
this
moment
stifled
her
or
was
it
triumph
after
all
she
heard
the
breath
of
the
little
man
behind
her
rattle
as
though
he
were
being
throttled
and
saw
the
lookout
pass
a
shaking
hand
to
his
chin
then
wet
his
parched
lips
she
saw
the
man
she
had
helped
to
ruin
bend
forward
his
lean
face
strained
and
hard
an
odd
look
of
pain
and
weariness
in
his
eyes
she
never
forgot
that
look
the
crowd
was
frozen
in
various
attitudes
of
eagerness
although
it
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
suspense
of
the
last
great
wager
it
knew
the
midas
and
what
it
meant
here
lay
half
of
it
hidden
beneath
a
tawdry
square
of
pasteboard
with
maddening
deliberation
the
kid
dealt
the
top
card
beneath
it
was
the
trey
of
spades
glenister
said
no
word
nor
made
a
move
some
one
coughed
and
it
sounded
like
a
gunshot
slowly
the
dealer
s
fingers
retraced
their
way
he
hesitated
purposely
and
leered
at
the
girl
then
the
disappeared
and
beneath
it
lay
the
ace
as
the
king
had
lain
on
that
other
wager
it
spelled
utter
ruin
to
glenister
he
raised
his
eyes
blindly
and
then
the
deathlike
silence
of
the
room
was
shattered
by
a
sudden
crash
cherry
malotte
had
closed
her
violently
at
the
same
instant
crying
shrill
and
clear
that
bet
is
off
the
cases
are
wrong
glenister
half
rose
overturning
his
chair
the
kid
lunged
forward
across
the
table
and
his
wonderful
hands
tense
and
thrust
themselves
forward
as
though
reaching
for
the
riches
she
had
snatched
away
they
worked
and
writhed
and
trembled
as
though
in
dumb
fury
the
nails
sinking
into
the
his
face
grew
livid
and
cruel
while
his
eyes
blazed
at
her
till
she
shrank
from
him
affrightedly
bracing
herself
away
from
the
table
with
rigid
arms
reason
came
slowly
back
to
glenister
and
understanding
with
it
he
seemed
to
awake
from
a
nightmare
he
could
read
all
too
plainly
the
gambler
s
look
of
baffled
hate
as
the
man
sprawled
on
the
table
his
arms
spread
wide
his
eyes
glaring
at
the
cowering
woman
who
shrank
before
him
like
a
rabbit
before
a
snake
she
tried
to
speak
but
choked
then
the
dealer
came
to
himself
and
cried
harshly
through
his
teeth
one
word
christ
he
raised
his
fist
and
struck
the
table
so
violently
that
chips
and
coppers
leaped
and
rolled
and
cherry
closed
her
eyes
to
lose
sight
of
his
awful
grimace
glenister
looked
down
on
him
and
said
i
think
i
understand
but
the
money
was
yours
anyhow
so
i
don
t
his
meaning
was
plain
the
kid
suddenly
jerked
open
the
drawer
before
him
but
glenister
clenched
his
right
hand
and
leaned
forward
the
miner
could
have
killed
him
with
a
blow
for
the
gambler
was
seated
and
at
his
mercy
the
kid
checked
himself
while
his
face
began
to
twitch
as
though
the
nerves
underlying
it
had
broken
bondage
and
were
dancing
in
a
wild
ungovernable
orgy
you
have
taught
me
a
lesson
was
all
that
glenister
said
and
with
that
he
pushed
through
the
crowd
and
out
into
the
cool
night
air
overhead
the
arctic
stars
winked
at
him
and
the
sea
smells
struck
him
clean
and
fresh
as
he
went
homeward
he
heard
the
distant
plaint
of
a
it
held
the
mystery
and
sadness
of
the
north
he
paused
and
baring
his
thick
matted
head
stood
for
a
long
time
gathering
himself
together
standing
so
he
made
certain
covenants
with
himself
and
vowed
solemnly
never
to
touch
another
card
at
the
same
moment
cherry
malotte
came
hurrying
to
her
cottage
door
fleeing
as
though
from
pursuit
or
from
some
hateful
haunted
spot
she
paused
before
entering
and
flung
her
arms
outward
into
the
dark
in
a
wide
gesture
of
despair
why
did
i
do
it
oh
did
i
do
it
i
can
t
understand

from

and

to
him

his
silvered
head
with
affection
he
took
her
cool
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
cheek
while
the
worry
that
haunted
him
habitually
of
late
gave
way
to
a
smile
it
s
work
little
girl
hard
and
thankless
work
that
s
all
this
country
is
intended
for
young
men
and
i
m
too
far
his
eyes
grew
grave
again
and
he
squeezed
her
fingers
nervously
as
though
at
the
thought
it
s
a
terrible
country
this
i
i
wish
we
had
never
seen
don
t
say
that
helen
cried
spiritedly
why
it
s
glorious
think
of
the
honor
you
re
a
united
states
judge
and
the
first
one
to
come
here
you
re
making
history
you
re
building
a
state
people
will
read
about
she
stooped
and
kissed
him
but
he
seemed
to
flinch
beneath
her
caress
of
course
i
ll
go
if
you
think
i
d
better
she
said
though
i
m
not
fond
of
alaskan
society
some
of
the
women
are
nice
but
the
others
she
shrugged
her
dainty
shoulders
they
talk
scandal
all
the
time
one
would
think
that
a
great
clean
fresh
vigorous
country
like
this
would
broaden
the
women
as
it
broadens
the
men
but
it
doesn
i
ll
tell
mcnamara
to
call
for
you
at
nine
o
clock
said
the
judge
as
he
arose
so
later
in
the
day
she
prepared
her
long
unused
finery
to
such
good
purpose
that
when
her
escort
called
for
her
that
evening
he
believed
her
the
loveliest
of
women
upon
their
arrival
at
the
hotel
he
regarded
her
with
a
fresh
access
of
pride
for
the
function
proved
to
bear
little
resemblance
to
a
party
the
women
wore
handsome
gowns
and
every
man
was
in
evening
dress
the
wide
hall
ran
the
length
of
the
hotel
and
was
flanked
with
boxes
while
its
floor
was
like
polished
glass
and
its
walls
effectively
decorated
oh
how
lovely
exclaimed
helen
as
she
first
caught
sight
of
it
it
s
just
like
i
ve
seen
cities
before
he
said
but
nothing
like
this
still
if
these
northerners
can
build
a
railroad
in
a
month
and
a
city
in
a
summer
why
shouldn
t
they
have
symphony
orchestras
and
louis
quinze
ballrooms
i
know
you
re
a
splendid
dancer
she
said
you
shall
be
my
judge
and
jury
i
ll
sign
this
card
as
often
as
i
dare
without
the
certainty
of
violence
at
the
hands
of
these
young
men
and
the
rest
of
the
time
i
ll
smoke
in
the
lobby
i
don
t
care
to
dance
with
any
one
but
after
the
first
waltz
he
left
her
surrounded
by
partners
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
ballroom
this
was
his
first
relaxation
since
landing
in
the
north
it
was
well
not
to
become
a
dull
boy
he
mused
and
as
he
chewed
his
cigar
he
pictured
with
an
odd
thrill
quite
unusual
with
him
that
slender
girl
with
her
coiled
mass
of
hair
her
ivory
shoulders
and
merry
smile
he
saw
her
float
past
to
the
measure
of
a
and
caught
himself
resenting
the
thought
of
another
man
s
enjoyment
of
the
girl
s
charms
even
for
an
instant
hold
on
alec
he
muttered
you
re
too
old
a
bird
to
lose
your
however
he
was
waiting
for
her
before
the
time
for
their
next
dance
she
seemed
to
have
lost
a
part
of
her
gayety
what
s
the
matter
aren
t
you
enjoying
yourself
oh
yes
she
returned
brightly
i
m
having
a
delightful
when
he
came
for
his
third
dance
she
was
more
than
ever
as
he
led
her
to
a
seat
they
passed
a
group
of
women
among
whom
were
champian
and
others
whom
he
knew
to
be
wives
of
men
prominent
in
the
town
he
had
seen
some
of
them
at
tea
in
judge
stillman
s
house
and
therefore
was
astonished
when
they
returned
his
greeting
but
ignored
helen
she
shrank
slightly
and
he
realized
that
there
was
something
wrong
he
could
not
guess
what
affairs
of
men
he
could
cope
with
but
the
subtleties
of
women
were
out
of
his
realm
what
ails
those
people
have
they
offended
you
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
i
have
spoken
to
them
but
they
cut
cut
he
exclaimed
her
voice
trembled
but
she
held
her
head
high
it
seems
as
though
all
the
women
in
nome
were
here
and
in
league
to
ignore
me
it
dazes
me
i
do
not
has
anybody
said
anything
to
you
he
inquired
fiercely
any
man
i
mean
no
no
the
men
are
kind
it
s
the
come
we
ll
go
indeed
we
will
not
she
said
proudly
i
shall
stay
and
face
it
out
i
have
done
nothing
to
run
away
from
and
i
intend
to
find
out
what
is
the
when
he
had
surrendered
her
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
dance
mcnamara
sought
for
some
acquaintance
whom
he
might
question
most
of
the
men
in
nome
either
hated
or
feared
him
but
he
espied
one
that
he
thought
suited
his
purpose
and
led
him
into
a
corner
i
want
you
to
answer
a
question
no
beating
about
the
bush
understand
i
m
blunt
and
i
want
you
to
all
your
wife
has
been
entertained
at
miss
chester
s
house
i
ve
seen
her
there
she
refuses
to
speak
to
the
girl
she
cut
her
dead
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
s
how
should
i
know
if
you
don
t
know
i
ll
ask
you
to
find
the
other
shook
his
head
amusedly
at
which
mcnamara
flared
up
i
say
you
will
and
you
ll
make
your
wife
apologize
before
she
leaves
this
hall
too
or
you
ll
answer
to
me
man
to
man
i
won
t
stand
to
have
a
girl
like
miss
chester
by
a
bunch
of
swells
and
that
goes
as
it
in
his
excitement
mcnamara
reverted
to
his
western
idiom
the
other
did
not
reply
at
once
for
it
is
embarrassing
to
deal
with
a
person
who
disregards
the
conventions
utterly
and
at
the
same
time
has
the
inclination
and
force
to
compel
obedience
the
boss
s
reputation
had
gone
abroad
well
er
i
know
about
it
in
a
general
way
but
of
course
i
don
t
go
much
on
such
things
you
d
better
let
it
go
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
among
the
ladies
about
well
er
the
fact
is
it
s
that
young
glenister
champian
had
the
next
to
them
er
him
i
should
say
on
the
way
up
from
the
states
and
she
saw
things
now
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
a
girl
can
do
what
she
pleases
but
champian
has
her
own
ideas
of
propriety
from
what
my
wife
could
learn
there
s
some
truth
in
the
story
too
so
you
can
t
blame
with
a
word
mcnamara
could
have
explained
the
gossip
and
made
this
man
put
his
wife
right
forcing
through
her
an
elucidation
of
the
silly
affair
in
such
a
way
as
to
spare
helen
s
feelings
and
cover
the
magpies
with
confusion
yet
he
hesitated
it
is
a
wise
skipper
who
trims
his
sails
to
every
breeze
he
thanked
his
informant
and
left
him
entering
the
lobby
he
saw
the
girl
hurrying
towards
him
take
me
away
quick
i
want
to
go
you
ve
changed
your
mind
yes
let
us
go
she
panted
and
when
they
were
outside
she
walked
so
rapidly
that
he
had
difficulty
in
keeping
pace
with
her
she
was
silent
and
he
knew
better
than
to
question
but
when
they
arrived
at
her
house
he
entered
took
off
his
overcoat
and
turned
up
the
light
in
the
tiny
parlor
she
flung
her
wraps
over
a
chair
storming
back
and
forth
like
a
little
fury
her
eyes
were
starry
with
tears
of
anger
her
face
was
flushed
her
hands
worked
nervously
he
leaned
against
the
mantel
watching
her
through
his
cigar
smoke
you
needn
t
tell
me
he
said
at
length
i
know
all
about
i
am
glad
you
do
i
never
could
repeat
what
they
said
oh
it
was
brutal
her
voice
caught
and
she
bit
her
lip
what
made
me
ask
them
why
didn
t
i
keep
still
after
you
left
i
went
to
those
women
and
faced
them
oh
but
they
were
brutal
yet
why
should
i
care
she
stamped
her
slippered
foot
i
shall
have
to
kill
that
man
some
day
he
said
flecking
his
cigar
ashes
into
the
grate
what
man
she
stood
still
and
looked
at
him
glenister
of
course
if
i
had
thought
the
story
would
ever
reach
you
i
d
have
shut
him
up
long
it
didn
t
come
from
him
she
cried
hot
with
indignation
he
s
a
gentleman
it
s
that
cat
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
slightest
bit
but
it
was
eloquent
and
she
noted
it
oh
i
don
t
mean
that
he
did
it
intentionally
he
s
too
decent
a
chap
for
that
but
anybody
s
tongue
will
wag
to
a
beautiful
girl
my
lady
malotte
is
a
jealous
malotte
who
is
she
helen
questioned
curiously
he
seemed
surprised
i
thought
every
one
knew
who
she
is
it
s
just
as
well
that
you
don
i
am
sure
glenister
would
not
talk
of
there
was
a
pause
who
is
miss
malotte
he
studied
for
a
moment
while
she
watched
him
what
a
splendid
figure
he
made
in
his
evening
clothes
the
cosey
room
with
its
shaded
lights
enhanced
his
size
and
strength
and
rugged
outlines
in
his
eyes
was
that
admiration
which
women
live
for
he
lifted
his
bold
handsome
face
and
met
her
gaze
i
had
rather
leave
that
for
you
to
find
out
for
i
m
not
much
at
scandal
i
have
something
more
important
to
tell
you
it
s
the
most
important
thing
i
have
ever
said
to
you
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
used
that
name
and
she
began
to
tremble
while
her
eyes
sought
the
door
in
a
panic
she
had
expected
this
moment
and
yet
was
not
ready
not
don
t
say
it
now
she
managed
to
articulate
yes
this
is
a
good
time
if
you
can
t
answer
i
ll
come
back
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
i
want
to
give
you
everything
the
world
offers
and
i
want
to
make
you
happy
girl
there
ll
be
no
gossip
hereafter
i
ll
shield
you
from
everything
unpleasant
and
if
there
is
anything
you
want
in
life
i
ll
lay
it
at
your
feet
i
can
do
he
lifted
his
massive
arms
and
in
the
set
of
his
strong
square
face
was
the
promise
that
she
should
have
whatever
she
craved
if
mortal
man
could
give
it
to
her
love
protection
position
adoration
she
stammered
uncertainly
till
the
humiliation
and
chagrin
she
had
suffered
this
night
swept
over
her
again
this
town
this
crude
had
turned
against
her
misjudged
her
cruelly
the
women
were
envious
clacking
all
of
them
who
would
ostracize
her
and
make
her
life
in
the
northland
a
misery
make
her
an
outcast
with
nothing
to
sustain
her
but
her
own
solitary
pride
she
could
picture
her
future
clearly
pitilessly
and
see
herself
standing
alone
vilified
harassed
in
a
thousand
cutting
ways
yet
unable
to
run
away
or
to
explain
she
would
have
to
stay
and
face
it
for
her
life
was
bound
up
here
during
the
next
few
years
or
so
or
as
long
as
her
uncle
remained
a
judge
this
man
would
free
her
he
loved
her
he
offered
her
everything
he
was
bigger
than
all
the
rest
combined
they
were
his
playthings
and
they
knew
it
she
was
not
sure
that
she
loved
him
but
his
magnetism
was
overpowering
and
her
admiration
intense
no
other
man
she
had
ever
known
compared
with
him
except
glenister
bah
the
beast
he
had
insulted
her
at
first
he
wronged
her
now
will
you
be
my
wife
helen
the
man
repeated
softly
she
dropped
her
head
and
he
strode
forward
to
take
her
in
his
arms
then
stopped
listening
some
one
ran
up
on
the
porch
and
hammered
loudly
at
the
door
mcnamara
scowled
walked
into
the
hall
and
flung
the
portal
open
disclosing
struve
hello
mcnamara
been
looking
all
over
for
you
there
s
the
deuce
to
pay
helen
sighed
with
relief
and
gathered
up
her
cloak
while
the
hum
of
their
voices
reached
her
indistinctly
she
was
given
plenty
of
time
to
regain
her
composure
before
they
appeared
when
they
did
the
politician
spoke
sourly
i
ve
been
called
to
the
mines
and
i
must
go
at
you
bet
it
may
be
too
late
now
the
news
came
an
hour
ago
but
i
couldn
t
find
you
said
struve
your
horse
is
saddled
at
the
office
better
not
wait
to
change
your
you
say
voorhees
has
gone
with
twenty
deputies
eh
that
s
good
you
stay
here
and
find
out
all
you
i
telephoned
out
to
the
creek
for
the
boys
to
arm
themselves
and
throw
out
pickets
if
you
hurry
you
can
get
there
in
time
it
s
only
midnight
what
is
the
trouble
miss
chester
inquired
anxiously
there
s
a
plot
on
to
attack
the
mines
answered
the
lawyer
the
other
side
are
trying
to
seize
them
and
there
s
apt
to
be
a
you
mustn
t
go
out
there
she
cried
aghast
there
will
be
that
s
just
why
i
go
said
mcnamara
i
ll
come
back
in
the
morning
though
and
i
d
like
to
see
you
alone
there
was
a
strange
new
light
in
his
eyes
as
he
left
her
for
one
unversed
in
woman
s
ways
he
played
the
game
surprisingly
well
and
as
he
hurried
towards
his
office
he
smiled
grimly
into
the
darkness
she
ll
answer
me
thank
you
glenister
he
said
to
himself
helen
questioned
struve
at
length
but
gained
nothing
more
than
that
men
had
been
at
work
for
weeks
and
had
unearthed
the
fact
that
vigilantes
had
been
formed
they
had
heard
enough
to
make
them
think
the
mines
would
be
jumped
again
and
so
had
given
the
alarm
have
you
hired
spies
she
asked
incredulously
sure
we
had
to
the
other
people
shadowed
us
and
it
s
come
to
a
point
where
it
s
life
or
death
to
one
side
or
the
other
i
told
mcnamara
we
d
have
bloodshed
before
we
were
through
when
he
first
outlined
the
scheme
i
mean
when
the
trouble
she
wrung
her
hands
that
s
what
uncle
feared
before
we
left
seattle
that
s
why
i
took
the
risks
i
did
in
bringing
you
those
papers
i
thought
you
got
them
in
time
to
avoid
all
struve
laughed
a
bit
eying
her
curiously
does
uncle
arthur
know
about
this
she
continued
no
we
don
t
let
him
know
anything
more
than
necessary
he
s
not
a
strong
yes
yes
he
s
not
again
the
lawyer
smiled
who
is
behind
this
vigilante
movement
we
think
it
is
glenister
and
his
new
mexican
bandit
partner
at
least
they
got
the
crowd
she
was
silent
for
a
time
i
suppose
they
really
think
they
own
those
but
they
don
t
do
they
somehow
this
question
had
recurred
to
her
insistently
of
late
for
things
were
constantly
happening
which
showed
there
was
more
back
of
this
great
fierce
struggle
than
she
knew
it
was
impossible
that
injustice
had
been
done
the
and
yet
scattered
talk
reached
her
which
was
puzzling
when
she
strove
to
follow
it
up
her
acquaintances
adroitly
changed
the
subject
she
was
baffled
on
every
side
the
three
local
newspapers
upheld
the
court
she
read
them
carefully
and
was
more
at
sea
than
ever
there
was
a
disturbing
undercurrent
of
alarm
and
unrest
that
caused
her
to
feel
insecure
as
though
standing
on
hollow
ground
yes
this
whole
disturbance
is
caused
by
those
two
only
for
them
we
d
be
all
who
is
miss
malotte
he
answered
promptly
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
north
and
the
most
in
what
way
who
is
she
it
s
hard
to
say
who
or
what
she
is
she
s
different
from
other
women
she
came
to
dawson
in
the
early
days
just
came
we
didn
t
know
how
whence
or
why
and
we
never
found
out
we
woke
up
one
morning
and
there
she
was
by
night
we
were
all
jealous
and
in
a
week
we
were
most
of
us
drivelling
idiots
it
might
have
been
the
mystery
or
perhaps
the
competition
that
was
the
day
when
a
girl
could
make
a
homestake
in
a
winter
or
marry
a
millionaire
in
a
month
but
she
never
bothered
she
toiled
not
neither
did
she
spin
on
the
waxed
floors
yet
solomon
in
all
his
glory
would
have
looked
like
a
tramp
beside
you
say
she
is
dangerous
well
there
was
the
young
nobleman
in
the
winter
of
dane
i
think
fine
family
and
all
that
big
boy
he
wanted
to
marry
her
but
a
shot
him
then
there
was
rock
of
the
mounted
police
the
finest
officer
in
the
service
he
was
cashiered
she
knew
he
was
going
to
pot
for
her
but
she
didn
t
seem
to
care
and
there
were
others
yet
with
it
all
she
is
the
most
generous
person
and
the
most
why
she
has
fed
every
stew
bum
on
the
yukon
and
there
isn
t
a
busted
prospector
in
the
country
who
wouldn
t
swear
by
her
for
she
has
grubstaked
dozens
of
them
i
was
horribly
in
love
with
her
myself
yes
she
s
dangerous
all
right
to
everybody
but
what
do
you
mean
she
had
been
across
the
yukon
to
nurse
a
man
with
scurvy
and
coming
back
she
was
caught
in
the
spring
i
wasn
t
there
but
it
seems
this
glenister
got
her
ashore
somehow
when
nobody
else
would
tackle
the
job
they
were
carried
five
miles
in
the
before
he
what
happened
then
she
fell
in
love
with
him
of
and
he
worshipped
her
as
madly
as
all
the
rest
of
you
i
suppose
she
said
scornfully
that
s
the
peculiar
part
she
hypnotized
him
at
first
but
he
ran
away
and
i
didn
t
hear
of
him
again
till
i
came
to
nome
she
followed
him
finally
and
last
week
evened
up
her
score
she
paid
him
back
for
saving
i
haven
t
heard
about
he
detailed
the
story
of
the
gambling
episode
at
the
northern
saloon
and
concluded
i
d
like
to
have
seen
that
turn
for
they
say
the
excitement
was
terrific
she
was
keeping
cases
and
at
the
finish
slammed
her
shut
and
declared
the
bet
off
because
she
had
made
a
mistake
of
course
they
couldn
t
dispute
her
and
she
stuck
to
it
one
of
the
told
me
she
lied
so
in
addition
to
his
other
vices
glenister
is
a
reckless
gambler
is
he
said
helen
with
heat
i
am
proud
to
be
indebted
to
such
a
character
truly
this
country
breeds
wonderful
there
s
where
you
re
wrong
struve
chuckled
he
s
never
been
known
to
bet
oh
i
m
tired
of
these
contradictions
she
cried
angrily
saloons
scandals
adventuresses
ugh
i
hate
it
i
it
why
did
i
ever
come
here
those
things
are
a
part
of
every
new
country
they
were
about
all
we
had
till
this
year
but
it
is
women
like
you
that
we
fellows
need
miss
helen
you
can
help
us
a
she
did
not
like
the
way
he
was
looking
at
her
and
remembered
that
her
uncle
was
and
asleep
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
now
for
it
s
late
and
i
am
very
the
clock
showed
twelve
so
after
letting
him
out
she
extinguished
the
light
and
dragged
herself
wearily
up
to
her
room
she
removed
her
outer
garments
and
threw
over
her
bare
shoulders
a
negligée
of
many
flounces
and
bewildering
clinging
looseness
as
she
took
down
her
heavy
braids
the
story
of
cherry
malotte
returned
to
her
tormentingly
so
glenister
had
saved
life
also
at
risk
of
his
own
what
a
very
gallant
cavalier
he
was
to
be
sure
he
should
bear
a
coat
of
arms
a
dragon
an
armed
knight
and
a
fainting
maiden
i
succor
ladies
in
distress
handsome
ones
should
be
the
motto
on
his
shield
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
north
struve
had
said
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
glass
and
made
a
mouth
at
the
petulant
tired
reflection
there
she
pictured
glenister
leaping
from
floe
to
floe
with
the
hungry
river
surging
and
snapping
at
his
feet
while
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
on
shore
gave
heart
to
the
girl
crouching
out
there
she
could
see
him
snatch
her
up
and
fight
his
way
back
to
safety
over
the
plunging
with
death
dragging
at
his
heels
what
a
strong
embrace
he
had
at
this
she
blushed
and
realized
with
a
shock
that
while
she
was
mooning
that
very
man
might
be
fighting
hand
to
hand
in
the
darkness
of
a
with
the
man
she
was
going
to
marry
a
moment
later
some
one
mounted
the
front
steps
below
and
knocked
sharply
truly
this
was
a
night
of
alarms
would
people
never
cease
coming
she
was
worn
out
but
at
the
thought
of
the
tragedy
abroad
and
the
sick
old
man
sleeping
near
by
she
lit
a
candle
and
slipped
to
avoid
disturbing
him
doubtless
it
was
some
message
from
mcnamara
she
thought
as
she
unchained
the
door
as
she
opened
it
she
fell
back
amazed
while
it
swung
wide
and
the
candle
flame
flickered
and
sputtered
in
the
night
air
roy
glenister
stood
there
grim
and
determined
his
soft
white
stetson
pulled
low
his
trousers
tucked
into
tan
in
his
hand
a
winchester
rifle
beneath
his
corduroy
coat
she
saw
a
loose
yellow
with
shells
and
the
nickelled
flash
of
a
revolver
without
invitation
he
strode
across
the
threshold
closing
the
door
behind
him
miss
chester
you
and
the
judge
must
dress
quickly
and
come
with
i
don
t
the
vigilantes
are
on
their
way
here
to
hang
him
come
with
me
to
my
house
where
i
can
protect
she
laid
a
trembling
hand
on
her
bosom
and
the
color
died
out
of
her
face
then
at
a
slight
noise
above
they
both
looked
up
to
see
judge
stillman
leaning
far
over
the
banister
he
had
wrapped
himself
in
a
and
now
gripped
the
rail
convulsively
while
his
features
were
blanched
to
the
color
of
putty
and
his
eyes
were
wide
with
terror
though
puffed
and
swollen
from
sleep
his
lips
moved
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
speak
chapter
xv
vigilantes
on
the
morning
after
the
episode
in
the
northern
glenister
awoke
under
a
weight
of
discouragement
and
desolation
the
past
hours
with
their
manifold
experiences
seemed
distant
and
unreal
at
breakfast
he
was
ashamed
to
tell
dextry
of
the
gambling
debauch
for
he
had
dealt
treacherously
with
the
old
man
in
risking
half
of
the
mine
even
though
they
had
agreed
that
either
might
do
as
he
chose
with
his
interest
regardless
of
the
other
it
all
seemed
like
a
nightmare
those
tense
moments
when
he
lay
above
the
receiver
s
office
and
felt
his
belief
in
the
one
woman
slipping
away
the
frenzied
thirst
which
cherry
malotte
had
checked
the
senseless
unreasoning
lust
for
play
that
possessed
him
later
this
lapse
was
the
last
stand
of
his
old
untamed
instincts
the
embers
of
revolt
in
him
were
dead
he
felt
that
he
would
never
again
lose
mastery
of
himself
that
his
passions
would
never
best
him
hereafter
dextry
spoke
we
had
a
meeting
of
the
strangles
last
he
always
spoke
of
the
vigilantes
in
that
way
because
of
his
early
western
training
what
was
done
they
decided
to
act
quick
and
do
any
odd
jobs
of
lynchin
or
such
as
needs
doin
there
s
a
lot
of
law
sharps
and
storekeepers
in
the
bunch
who
figure
mcnamara
s
gang
will
wipe
them
off
the
map
it
was
bound
to
come
to
they
talked
of
ejectin
the
receiver
s
men
and
puttin
all
us
fellers
back
on
our
good
how
many
can
we
count
on
to
help
us
about
sixty
we
ve
kept
the
number
down
and
only
taken
men
with
so
much
property
that
they
ll
have
to
keep
their
mouths
i
wish
we
might
engineer
some
kind
of
an
encounter
with
the
court
crowd
and
create
such
an
uproar
that
it
would
reach
washington
everything
else
has
failed
and
our
last
chance
seems
to
be
for
the
government
to
step
in
that
is
unless
bill
wheaton
can
do
something
with
the
california
i
don
t
count
on
him
mcnamara
don
t
care
for
california
courts
no
more
n
he
would
for
a
boy
with
a
he
s
got
too
much
pull
at
headquarters
if
the
stranglers
don
t
do
no
good
we
d
better
go
in
an
clean
out
the
bunch
like
we
was
killin
snakes
if
that
fails
i
m
goin
out
to
the
states
an
be
a
a
doctor
what
for
i
read
somewhere
that
in
the
united
states
every
year
there
is
forty
million
gallons
of
whiskey
used
for
medical
glenister
laughed
speaking
of
whiskey
dex
i
notice
that
you
ve
been
drinking
pretty
hard
of
late
that
is
hard
for
the
old
man
shook
his
head
you
re
mistaken
it
ain
t
hard
for
well
hard
or
easy
you
d
better
cut
it
it
was
some
time
later
that
one
of
the
detectives
employed
by
the
swedes
met
glenister
on
front
street
and
by
an
almost
imperceptible
sign
signified
his
desire
to
speak
with
him
when
they
were
alone
he
said
you
re
being
i
ve
known
that
for
a
long
the
has
put
on
some
new
men
i
ve
fixed
the
woman
who
rooms
next
to
him
and
through
her
i
ve
got
a
line
on
some
of
them
but
i
haven
t
spotted
them
all
they
re
bad
ones
men
mostly
remnants
of
soapy
smith
s
skagway
gang
they
won
t
stop
at
thank
you
i
ll
keep
my
eyes
a
few
nights
after
glenister
had
reason
to
recall
the
words
of
the
sleuth
and
to
realize
that
the
game
was
growing
close
and
desperate
to
reach
his
cabin
which
sat
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
he
ordinarily
followed
one
of
the
plank
walks
which
wound
through
the
confusion
of
tents
warehouses
and
cottages
lying
back
of
the
two
principal
streets
along
the
water
front
this
part
of
the
city
was
not
laid
out
in
rectangular
blocks
for
in
the
early
rush
the
had
seized
whatever
pieces
of
ground
they
found
vacant
and
erected
thereon
some
kind
of
buildings
to
make
good
their
titles
there
resulted
a
formless
jumble
of
huts
cabins
and
sheds
penetrated
by
no
cross
streets
and
quite
unlighted
at
night
one
leaving
the
illuminated
portion
of
the
town
found
this
darkness
intensified
glenister
knew
his
course
so
well
that
he
could
have
walked
it
blindfolded
nearing
a
corner
of
the
warehouse
this
evening
he
remembered
that
the
planking
at
this
point
was
torn
up
so
to
avoid
the
mud
he
leaped
lightly
across
simultaneously
with
his
jump
he
detected
a
movement
in
the
shadows
that
banked
the
wall
at
his
elbow
and
saw
the
flaming
spurt
of
a
the
man
had
crouched
behind
the
building
and
was
so
close
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
miss
glenister
fell
heavily
upon
his
side
and
the
thought
flashed
over
him
mcnamara
s
thugs
have
shot
his
assailant
leaped
out
from
his
and
ran
down
the
walk
the
sound
of
his
quick
soft
footfalls
thudding
faintly
out
into
the
silence
the
young
man
felt
no
pain
however
so
scrambled
to
his
feet
felt
himself
over
with
care
and
then
swore
roundly
he
was
untouched
the
other
had
missed
him
cleanly
the
report
coming
while
he
was
in
the
act
of
leaping
had
startled
him
so
that
he
had
lost
his
balance
slipped
upon
the
wet
boards
and
fallen
his
assailant
was
lost
in
the
darkness
before
he
could
rise
pursuit
was
out
of
the
question
so
he
continued
homeward
considerably
shaken
and
related
the
incident
to
dextry
you
think
it
was
some
of
mcnamara
s
work
eh
dextry
inquired
when
he
had
finished
of
course
didn
t
the
detective
warn
me
dextry
shook
his
head
it
don
t
seem
like
the
game
is
that
far
along
yet
the
time
is
coming
when
we
ll
go
to
the
mat
with
them
people
but
they
ve
got
the
aige
on
us
now
so
what
could
they
gain
by
putting
you
away
i
don
t
believe
it
s
them
but
whoever
it
is
you
d
better
be
careful
or
you
ll
be
suppose
we
come
home
together
after
this
roy
suggested
and
they
arranged
to
do
so
realizing
that
danger
lurked
in
the
dark
corners
and
that
it
was
in
some
such
lonely
spot
that
the
deed
would
be
tried
again
they
experienced
no
trouble
for
a
time
though
on
nearing
their
cabin
one
night
the
younger
man
fancied
that
he
saw
a
shadow
glide
away
from
its
vicinity
and
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
tundra
as
though
some
one
had
stood
at
his
very
door
waiting
for
him
then
became
frightened
at
the
two
figures
approaching
dextry
had
not
observed
it
however
and
glenister
was
not
positive
himself
but
it
served
to
give
him
the
uncanny
feeling
that
some
determined
unscrupulous
force
was
bent
on
his
destruction
he
determined
to
go
nowhere
unarmed
a
few
evenings
later
he
went
home
early
and
was
busied
in
writing
when
dextry
came
in
about
ten
o
clock
the
old
miner
hung
up
his
coat
before
speaking
lit
a
cigarette
inhaled
deeply
then
amid
mouthfuls
of
smoke
began
i
had
my
own
toes
over
the
edge
i
was
mistook
for
you
which
compliment
i
don
t
aim
to
have
glenister
questioned
him
eagerly
we
re
about
the
same
height
an
these
hats
of
ours
are
alike
just
as
i
come
by
that
down
yonder
a
man
hopped
out
an
throwed
a
gat
under
my
nose
he
was
quicker
than
light
and
near
blowed
my
skelp
into
the
next
block
before
he
saw
who
i
was
then
he
dropped
his
weepon
and
said
my
mistake
go
i
accepted
his
could
you
see
who
he
was
sure
i
can
it
was
the
bronco
lord
ejaculated
glenister
do
you
think
he
s
after
me
he
ain
t
after
nobody
else
an
take
my
word
for
it
it
s
got
nothin
to
do
with
mcnamara
nor
that
gamblin
row
he
s
too
game
for
that
there
s
some
other
this
was
the
first
mention
dextry
had
made
of
the
night
at
the
northern
i
don
t
know
why
he
should
have
it
in
for
me
i
never
did
him
any
favors
glenister
remarked
cynically
well
you
watch
out
anyhow
i
d
sooner
face
mcnamara
an
all
the
crooks
he
can
hire
than
that
during
the
next
few
days
roy
undertook
to
meet
the
proprietor
of
the
northern
face
to
face
but
the
kid
had
vanished
completely
from
his
haunts
he
was
not
in
his
at
night
nor
on
the
street
by
day
the
young
man
was
still
looking
for
him
on
the
evening
of
the
dance
at
the
hotel
when
he
chanced
to
meet
one
of
the
vigilantes
who
inquired
of
him
aren
t
you
late
for
the
meeting
what
meeting
after
seeing
that
they
were
alone
the
other
stated
there
s
an
assembly
at
eleven
o
clock
something
important
i
think
i
supposed
of
course
you
knew
about
it
s
strange
i
wasn
t
notified
said
roy
it
s
probably
an
oversight
i
ll
go
along
with
together
they
crossed
the
river
to
the
less
frequented
part
of
town
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
large
unlighted
warehouse
flanked
by
a
high
board
fence
the
building
faced
the
street
but
was
enclosed
on
the
other
three
sides
by
this
wall
inside
of
which
were
stored
large
quantities
of
coal
and
lumber
after
some
delay
they
were
admitted
and
passing
down
through
the
lanes
of
merchandise
came
to
the
rear
room
where
they
were
admitted
again
this
compartment
had
been
fitted
up
for
the
warm
storage
of
perishable
goods
during
the
cold
weather
and
being
without
windows
made
an
ideal
place
for
clandestine
gatherings
glenister
was
astonished
to
find
every
man
of
the
organization
present
including
dextry
whom
he
supposed
to
have
gone
home
an
hour
since
evidently
a
discussion
had
been
in
progress
for
a
chairman
was
presiding
and
the
boxes
kegs
and
bales
of
goods
had
been
shoved
back
against
the
walls
for
seats
on
these
were
ranged
the
threescore
men
of
the
stranglers
their
serious
faces
lighted
imperfectly
by
scattered
lanterns
a
certain
constraint
seized
them
upon
glenister
s
entrance
the
chairman
was
embarrassed
it
was
but
momentary
however
glenister
himself
felt
that
tragedy
was
in
the
air
for
it
showed
in
the
men
s
attitudes
and
spoke
eloquently
from
their
strained
faces
he
was
about
to
question
the
man
next
to
him
when
the
presiding
officer
continued
we
will
assemble
here
quietly
with
our
arms
at
one
o
clock
and
let
me
caution
you
again
not
to
talk
or
do
anything
to
scare
the
birds
glenister
arose
i
came
late
chairman
so
i
missed
hearing
your
plan
i
gather
that
you
re
out
for
business
however
and
i
want
to
be
in
it
may
i
ask
what
is
on
foot
certainly
things
have
reached
such
a
pass
that
moderate
means
are
useless
we
have
decided
to
act
and
act
quickly
we
have
exhausted
every
legal
resource
and
now
we
re
going
to
stamp
out
this
gang
of
robbers
in
our
own
way
we
will
get
together
in
an
hour
divide
into
three
groups
of
twenty
men
each
with
a
leader
then
go
to
the
houses
of
mcnamara
stillman
and
voorhees
take
them
prisoners
and
he
waved
his
hand
in
a
large
gesture
glenister
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
while
the
crowd
watched
him
intently
you
have
discussed
this
fully
he
asked
we
have
it
has
been
voted
on
and
we
re
my
friends
when
i
stepped
into
this
room
just
now
i
felt
that
i
wasn
t
wanted
why
i
don
t
know
because
i
have
had
more
to
do
with
organizing
this
movement
than
any
of
you
and
because
i
have
suffered
just
as
much
as
the
rest
i
want
to
know
if
i
was
omitted
from
this
meeting
this
is
an
embarrassing
position
to
put
me
in
said
the
chairman
gravely
but
i
shall
answer
as
spokesman
for
these
men
if
they
yes
go
ahead
said
those
around
the
room
we
don
t
question
your
loyalty
glenister
but
we
didn
t
ask
you
to
this
meeting
because
we
know
your
attitude
perhaps
i
d
better
say
sentiment
regarding
judge
stillman
s
niece
er
family
it
has
come
to
us
from
various
sources
that
you
have
been
affected
to
the
prejudice
of
your
own
and
your
partner
s
interest
now
there
isn
t
going
to
be
any
sentiment
in
the
affairs
of
the
vigilantes
we
are
going
to
do
justice
and
we
thought
the
simplest
way
was
to
ignore
you
in
this
matter
and
spare
all
discussion
and
hard
feeling
in
every
it
s
a
lie
shouted
the
young
man
hoarsely
a
damned
lie
you
wouldn
t
let
me
in
for
fear
i
d
kick
eh
well
you
were
right
i
will
kick
you
ve
hinted
about
my
feelings
for
miss
chester
let
me
tell
you
that
she
is
engaged
to
marry
mcnamara
and
that
she
s
nothing
to
me
now
then
let
me
tell
you
further
that
you
won
t
break
into
her
house
and
hang
her
uncle
even
if
he
is
a
reprobate
no
sir
this
isn
t
the
time
for
violence
of
that
sort
we
ll
win
without
it
if
we
can
t
let
s
fight
like
men
and
not
hunt
in
a
pack
like
wolves
if
you
want
to
do
something
put
us
back
on
our
mines
and
help
us
hold
them
but
for
god
s
sake
don
t
descend
to
assassination
and
the
tactics
of
the
mafia
we
knew
you
would
make
that
kind
of
a
talk
said
the
speaker
while
the
rest
murmured
grudgingly
one
of
them
spoke
up
we
ve
talked
this
over
in
cold
blood
glenister
and
it
s
a
question
of
their
lives
or
our
liberty
the
law
don
t
enter
into
that
s
right
echoed
another
at
his
elbow
we
can
t
seize
the
claims
because
mcnamara
s
got
soldiers
to
back
him
up
they
d
shoot
us
down
you
ought
to
be
the
last
one
to
he
saw
that
dispute
was
futile
determination
was
stamped
on
their
faces
too
plainly
for
mistake
and
his
argument
had
no
more
effect
on
them
than
had
the
pale
rays
of
the
lantern
beside
him
yet
he
continued
i
don
t
deny
that
mcnamara
deserves
lynching
but
stillman
doesn
t
he
s
a
weak
old
man
some
one
laughed
derisively
and
there
s
a
woman
in
the
house
he
s
all
she
has
in
the
world
to
depend
upon
and
you
would
have
to
kill
her
to
get
at
him
if
you
follow
this
course
take
the
others
but
leave
him
they
only
shook
their
heads
while
several
pushed
by
him
even
as
he
spoke
we
re
going
to
distribute
our
favors
equal
said
a
man
as
he
left
they
were
actuated
by
what
they
called
justice
and
he
could
not
sway
them
the
life
and
welfare
of
the
north
were
in
their
hands
as
they
thought
and
there
was
not
one
to
hesitate
glenister
implored
the
chairman
but
the
man
answered
him
it
s
too
late
for
further
discussion
and
let
me
remind
you
of
your
promise
you
re
bound
by
every
obligation
that
exists
for
an
honorable
man
oh
don
t
think
that
i
ll
give
the
snap
away
said
the
other
but
i
warn
you
again
not
to
enter
stillman
s
he
followed
out
into
the
night
to
find
that
dextry
had
disappeared
evidently
wishing
to
avoid
argument
roy
had
seen
signs
of
unrest
beneath
the
prospector
s
restraint
during
the
past
few
days
and
indications
of
a
fierce
hunger
to
vent
his
spleen
on
the
men
who
had
robbed
him
of
his
most
sacred
rights
he
was
of
an
intolerant
vindictive
nature
that
would
go
to
any
length
for
vengeance
retribution
was
part
of
his
creed
on
his
way
home
the
young
man
looked
at
his
watch
to
find
that
he
had
but
an
hour
to
determine
his
course
instinct
prompted
him
to
join
his
friends
and
to
even
the
score
with
the
men
who
had
injured
him
so
bitterly
for
measured
by
standards
of
the
frontier
they
were
pirates
with
their
lives
forfeit
yet
he
could
not
countenance
this
step
if
only
the
vigilantes
would
be
content
with
making
an
example
but
he
knew
they
would
not
the
blood
hunger
of
a
mob
is
easy
to
whet
and
hard
to
hold
mcnamara
would
resist
as
would
voorhees
and
the
then
there
would
be
bloodshed
riot
chaos
the
soldiers
would
be
called
out
and
martial
law
declared
the
streets
would
become
the
vigilantes
would
rout
them
without
question
for
every
citizen
of
the
north
would
rally
to
their
aid
and
such
men
could
not
be
stopped
the
judge
would
go
down
with
the
rest
of
the
ring
and
what
would
happen
to
her
he
took
down
his
winchester
oiled
and
cleaned
it
then
buckled
on
a
belt
of
cartridges
still
he
wrestled
with
himself
he
felt
that
he
was
being
ground
between
his
loyalty
to
the
vigilantes
and
his
own
conscience
the
girl
was
one
of
the
gang
he
reasoned
she
had
schemed
with
them
to
betray
him
through
his
love
and
she
was
pledged
to
the
one
man
in
the
world
whom
he
hated
with
fanatical
fury
why
should
he
think
of
her
in
this
hour
six
months
back
he
would
have
looked
with
jealous
eyes
upon
the
right
to
lead
the
vigilantes
but
this
change
that
had
mastered
him
what
was
it
not
cowardice
nor
caution
no
yet
being
intangible
it
was
none
the
less
marked
as
his
friends
had
shown
him
an
hour
since
he
slipped
out
into
the
night
the
mob
might
do
as
it
pleased
elsewhere
but
no
man
should
enter
her
house
he
found
a
light
shining
from
her
parlor
window
and
noting
the
shade
up
a
few
inches
stole
close
peering
through
he
discovered
struve
and
helen
talking
he
slunk
back
into
the
shadows
and
remained
hidden
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
lawyer
left
for
the
dancers
were
returning
from
the
hotel
and
passed
close
by
when
the
last
group
had
chattered
away
down
the
street
he
returned
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
mounting
the
steps
knocked
sharply
as
helen
appeared
at
the
door
he
stepped
inside
and
closed
it
after
him
the
girl
s
hair
lay
upon
her
neck
and
shoulders
in
tumbled
brown
masses
while
her
breast
heaved
tumultuously
at
the
sudden
grim
sight
of
him
she
stepped
back
against
the
wall
her
wondrous
deep
gray
eyes
wide
and
troubled
the
blush
of
modesty
struggling
with
the
pallor
of
dismay
the
picture
pained
him
like
a
this
girl
was
for
his
bitterest
enemy
no
hope
of
her
was
for
him
he
forgot
for
a
moment
that
she
was
false
and
plotting
then
recalling
it
spoke
as
roughly
as
he
might
and
stated
his
errand
then
the
old
man
had
appeared
on
the
stairs
above
speechless
with
fright
at
what
he
overheard
it
was
evident
that
his
nerves
so
sorely
strained
by
the
events
of
the
past
week
were
now
snapped
utterly
a
human
soul
naked
and
is
no
pleasant
sight
so
glenister
dropped
his
eyes
and
addressed
the
girl
again
don
t
take
anything
with
you
just
dress
and
come
with
the
creature
on
the
stairs
above
stammered
and
stuttered
inquiringly
what
outrage
is
this
glenister
the
people
of
nome
are
up
in
arms
and
i
ve
come
to
save
you
don
t
stop
to
he
spoke
impatiently
is
this
some
to
get
me
into
your
power
uncle
arthur
exclaimed
the
girl
sharply
her
eyes
met
glenister
s
and
begged
him
to
take
no
offence
i
don
t
understand
this
atrocity
they
must
be
mad
wailed
the
judge
you
run
over
to
the
jail
glenister
and
tell
voorhees
to
hurry
guards
here
to
protect
me
helen
phone
to
the
military
post
and
give
the
alarm
tell
them
the
soldiers
must
come
at
hold
on
said
glenister
there
s
no
use
of
doing
that
the
wires
are
cut
and
i
won
t
notify
voorhees
he
can
take
care
of
himself
i
came
to
help
you
and
if
you
want
to
escape
you
ll
stop
talking
and
hurry
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
said
stillman
torn
by
terror
and
indecision
you
wouldn
t
hurt
an
old
man
would
you
wait
i
ll
be
down
in
a
he
scrambled
up
the
stairs
tripping
on
his
robe
seemingly
forgetting
his
niece
till
she
called
up
to
him
sharply
stop
uncle
arthur
you
mustn
t
she
stood
erect
and
determined
you
wouldn
t
do
would
you
this
is
our
house
you
represent
the
law
and
the
dignity
of
the
government
you
mustn
t
fear
a
mob
of
ruffians
we
will
stay
here
and
meet
them
of
good
lord
said
glenister
that
s
madness
these
men
aren
t
ruffians
they
are
the
best
citizens
of
nome
you
don
t
realize
that
this
is
alaska
and
that
they
have
sworn
to
wipe
out
mcnamara
s
gang
come
thank
you
for
your
good
intentions
she
said
but
we
have
done
nothing
to
run
away
from
we
will
get
ready
to
meet
these
cowards
you
had
better
go
or
they
will
find
you
she
moved
up
the
stairs
and
taking
the
judge
by
the
arm
led
him
with
her
of
a
sudden
she
had
assumed
control
of
the
situation
unfalteringly
and
both
men
felt
the
impossibility
of
thwarting
her
pausing
at
the
top
she
turned
and
looked
down
we
are
grateful
for
your
efforts
just
the
same
oh
i
m
not
going
said
the
young
man
if
you
stick
i
ll
do
the
he
made
the
rounds
of
the
rooms
locking
doors
and
windows
as
a
place
of
defence
it
was
hopeless
and
he
saw
that
he
would
have
to
make
his
stand
when
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
he
called
up
to
helen
may
i
come
yes
she
replied
so
he
ascended
to
find
stillman
in
the
hall
half
clothed
and
cowering
while
by
the
light
from
the
front
chamber
he
saw
her
finishing
her
toilet
won
t
you
come
with
me
it
s
our
last
chance
she
only
shook
her
head
well
then
put
out
the
light
i
ll
stand
at
that
front
window
and
when
my
eyes
get
used
to
the
darkness
i
ll
be
able
to
see
them
before
they
reach
the
she
did
as
directed
taking
her
place
beside
him
at
the
opening
while
the
judge
crept
in
and
sat
upon
the
bed
his
heavy
breathing
the
only
sound
in
the
room
the
two
young
people
stood
so
close
beside
each
other
that
the
sweet
scent
of
her
person
awoke
in
him
an
almost
irresistible
longing
he
forgot
her
treachery
again
forgot
that
she
was
another
s
forgot
all
save
that
he
loved
her
truly
and
purely
with
a
love
which
was
like
an
agony
to
him
her
shoulder
brushed
his
arm
he
heard
the
soft
rustling
of
her
garment
at
her
breast
as
she
breathed
some
one
passed
in
the
street
and
she
laid
a
hand
upon
him
fearfully
it
was
very
cold
very
tiny
and
very
soft
but
he
made
no
move
to
take
it
the
moments
dragged
along
still
tense
interminable
occasionally
she
leaned
towards
him
and
he
stooped
to
catch
her
whispered
words
at
such
times
her
breath
beat
warm
against
his
cheek
and
he
closed
his
teeth
stubbornly
out
in
the
night
a
saddened
the
air
then
came
the
sound
of
others
wrangling
and
snarling
in
a
corral
this
is
a
chickless
land
and
no
breaks
the
midnight
peace
the
suspense
enhanced
the
judge
s
perturbation
till
his
chattering
teeth
sounded
like
castanets
now
and
then
he
groaned
the
watchers
had
lost
track
of
time
when
their
strained
eyes
detected
dark
blots
materializing
out
of
the
shadows
there
they
come
whispered
glenister
forcing
her
back
from
the
aperture
but
she
would
not
be
denied
and
returned
to
his
side
as
the
foremost
figures
reached
the
gate
roy
leaned
forth
and
spoke
not
loudly
but
in
tones
that
sliced
through
the
silence
sharp
clean
and
without
warning
halt
don
t
come
inside
the
there
was
an
instant
s
confusion
then
before
the
men
beneath
had
time
to
answer
or
take
action
he
continued
this
is
roy
glenister
talking
i
told
you
not
to
molest
these
people
and
i
warn
you
again
we
re
ready
for
the
leader
spoke
you
re
a
traitor
he
winced
perhaps
i
am
you
betrayed
me
first
though
and
traitor
or
not
you
can
t
come
into
this
there
was
a
murmur
at
this
and
some
one
said
miss
chester
is
safe
all
we
want
is
the
judge
we
won
t
hang
him
not
if
he
ll
wear
this
suit
we
brought
along
he
needn
t
be
afraid
tar
is
good
for
the
oh
my
god
groaned
the
limb
of
the
law
suddenly
a
man
came
running
down
the
planked
pavement
and
into
the
group
mcnamara
s
gone
and
so
s
the
marshal
and
the
rest
he
panted
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
and
then
the
leader
growled
to
his
men
scatter
out
and
rush
the
house
he
raised
his
voice
to
the
man
in
the
window
this
is
your
work
you
damned
his
followers
melted
away
to
right
and
left
vaulted
the
fence
and
dodged
into
the
shelter
of
the
walls
the
click
click
of
glenister
s
winchester
sounded
through
the
room
while
the
sweat
stood
out
on
him
he
wondered
if
he
could
do
this
deed
if
he
could
really
fire
on
these
people
he
wondered
if
his
muscles
would
not
wither
and
paralyze
before
they
obeyed
his
command
helen
crowded
past
him
and
leaning
half
out
of
the
opening
called
loudly
her
voice
ringing
clear
and
true
wait
wait
a
moment
i
have
something
to
say
glenister
didn
t
warn
them
they
thought
you
were
going
to
attack
the
mines
and
so
they
rode
out
there
before
midnight
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
really
they
left
hours
it
was
the
first
sign
she
had
made
and
they
recognized
her
to
a
man
there
were
uncertain
mutterings
below
till
a
new
man
raised
his
voice
both
roy
and
helen
recognized
dextry
boys
we
ve
overplayed
we
don
t
want
people
mcnamara
s
our
meat
old
up
yonder
has
to
do
what
he
s
told
and
i
m
ag
in
this
midnight
work
i
m
goin
there
were
some
whisperings
then
the
original
spokesman
called
for
judge
stillman
the
old
man
tottered
to
the
window
a
palsied
object
the
girl
was
glad
he
could
not
be
seen
from
below
we
won
t
hurt
you
this
time
judge
but
you
ve
gone
far
enough
we
ll
give
you
another
chance
then
if
you
don
t
make
good
we
ll
stretch
you
to
a
lamppost
take
this
as
a
i
do
my
said
the
judge
the
men
disappeared
into
the
darkness
and
when
they
had
gone
glenister
closed
the
window
pulled
down
the
shades
and
lighted
a
lamp
he
knew
by
how
narrow
a
margin
a
tragedy
had
been
averted
if
he
had
fired
on
these
men
his
shot
would
have
kindled
a
feud
which
would
have
consumed
every
vestige
of
the
court
crowd
and
himself
among
them
he
would
have
fallen
under
a
false
banner
and
his
life
would
not
have
reached
to
the
next
sunset
perhaps
it
was
forfeit
now
he
could
not
tell
the
vigilantes
would
probably
look
upon
his
part
as
traitorous
and
at
the
very
least
he
had
cut
himself
off
from
their
support
the
only
support
the
northland
offered
him
henceforth
he
was
a
renegade
a
pariah
hated
alike
by
both
factions
he
purposely
avoided
sight
of
stillman
and
turned
his
back
when
the
judge
extended
his
hand
with
expressions
of
gratitude
his
work
was
done
and
he
wished
to
leave
this
house
helen
followed
him
down
to
the
door
and
as
he
opened
it
laid
her
hand
upon
his
sleeve
words
are
feeble
things
and
i
can
never
make
amends
for
all
you
ve
done
for
for
cried
roy
with
a
break
in
his
voice
do
you
think
i
sacrificed
my
honor
betrayed
my
friends
killed
my
last
hope
ostracized
myself
for
this
is
the
last
time
i
ll
trouble
you
perhaps
the
last
time
i
ll
see
you
no
matter
what
else
you
ve
done
however
you
ve
taught
me
a
lesson
and
i
thank
you
for
it
i
have
found
myself
at
last
i
m
not
an
eskimo
any
longer
i
m
a
man
you
ve
always
been
that
she
said
i
don
t
understand
as
much
about
this
affair
as
i
want
to
and
it
seems
to
me
that
no
one
will
explain
it
i
m
very
stupid
i
guess
but
won
t
you
come
back
and
tell
it
to
me
no
he
said
roughly
you
re
not
of
my
people
mcnamara
and
his
are
no
friends
of
mine
and
i
m
no
friend
of
he
was
half
down
the
steps
before
she
said
softly
and
god
bless
you
she
returned
to
the
judge
who
was
in
a
pitiable
state
and
for
a
long
time
she
labored
to
soothe
him
as
though
he
were
a
child
she
undertook
to
question
him
about
the
things
which
lay
uppermost
in
her
mind
and
which
this
night
had
half
revealed
but
he
became
fretful
and
irritated
at
the
mention
of
mines
and
mining
she
sat
beside
his
bed
till
he
dozed
off
puzzling
to
discover
what
lay
behind
the
hints
she
had
heard
till
her
brain
and
body
matched
in
absolute
weariness
the
reflex
of
the
day
s
excitement
sapped
her
strength
till
she
could
barely
creep
to
her
own
couch
where
she
rolled
and
sighed
too
tired
to
sleep
at
once
she
awoke
finally
with
one
last
nervous
flicker
before
complete
oblivion
took
her
a
sentence
was
on
her
mind
it
almost
seemed
as
though
she
had
spoken
it
aloud
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
north
but
glenister
ran
chapter
xvi
in
which
the
truth
begins
to
bare
itself
it
was
nearly
noon
of
the
next
day
when
helen
awoke
to
find
that
mcnamara
had
ridden
in
from
the
creek
and
stopped
for
breakfast
with
the
judge
he
had
asked
for
her
but
on
hearing
the
tale
of
the
night
s
adventure
would
not
allow
her
to
be
disturbed
later
he
and
the
judge
had
gone
away
together
although
her
judgment
approved
the
step
she
had
contemplated
the
night
before
still
the
girl
now
felt
a
strange
reluctance
to
meet
mcnamara
it
is
true
that
she
knew
no
ill
of
him
except
that
implied
in
the
accusations
of
certain
embittered
men
and
she
was
aware
that
every
strong
and
aggressive
character
makes
enemies
in
direct
proportion
to
the
qualities
which
lend
him
greatness
nevertheless
she
was
aware
of
an
inner
conflict
that
she
had
not
foreseen
this
man
who
so
confidently
believed
that
she
would
marry
him
did
not
dominate
her
consciousness
she
had
ridden
much
of
late
taking
long
solitary
gallops
beside
the
shimmering
sea
that
she
loved
so
well
or
up
the
winding
valleys
into
the
where
echoed
the
roar
of
swift
waters
or
glinted
the
flash
of
shovel
blades
this
morning
her
horse
was
lame
so
she
determined
to
walk
in
her
early
rambles
she
had
looked
timidly
askance
at
the
rough
men
she
met
till
she
discovered
their
genuine
respect
and
courtesy
the
most
unkempt
among
them
were
often
although
for
that
matter
the
roughest
of
the
miners
showed
abundant
consideration
for
a
woman
so
she
was
glad
to
allow
the
men
to
talk
to
her
with
the
fine
freedom
inspired
by
the
new
country
and
its
wide
spaces
the
wilderness
breeds
a
chivalry
all
its
own
thus
there
seemed
to
be
no
danger
abroad
though
they
had
told
the
girl
of
mad
dogs
which
roamed
the
city
explaining
that
the
hot
weather
affects
powerfully
the
shaggy
this
is
the
land
of
the
dog
and
whereas
in
winter
his
lot
is
to
labor
and
shiver
and
starve
in
summer
he
loafs
fights
grows
fat
and
runs
mad
with
the
heat
helen
walked
far
and
returning
chose
an
unfamiliar
course
through
the
outskirts
of
the
town
to
avoid
meeting
any
of
the
women
she
knew
because
of
that
vivid
memory
of
the
night
before
as
she
walked
swiftly
along
she
thought
that
she
heard
faint
cries
far
behind
her
looking
up
she
noted
that
it
was
a
lonely
barren
quarter
and
that
the
only
figure
in
sight
was
a
woman
some
distance
away
a
few
paces
farther
on
the
shouts
recurred
more
plainly
this
time
and
a
gunshot
sounded
glancing
back
she
saw
several
men
running
one
bearing
a
smoking
revolver
and
heard
nearer
still
the
snarling
hubbub
of
fighting
dogs
in
a
flash
the
girl
s
curiosity
became
horror
for
as
she
watched
one
of
the
dogs
made
a
sudden
dash
through
the
now
subdued
group
of
animals
and
ran
swiftly
along
the
planking
on
which
she
stood
it
was
a
handsome
specimen
of
the
eskimo
malamoot
tall
gray
and
coated
like
a
wolf
with
the
speed
strength
and
cunning
of
its
cousin
its
head
hung
low
and
swung
from
side
to
side
as
it
trotted
the
motion
flecking
foam
and
slaver
the
creature
had
scattered
the
pack
and
now
swift
menacing
relentless
was
coming
towards
helen
there
was
no
shelter
near
no
fence
no
house
save
the
distant
one
towards
which
the
other
woman
was
making
her
way
the
men
too
far
away
to
protect
her
shouted
hoarse
warnings
helen
did
not
scream
nor
hesitate
she
turned
and
ran
towards
the
distant
cottage
she
was
blind
with
fright
and
felt
an
utter
certainty
that
the
dog
would
attack
her
before
she
could
reach
safety
yes
there
was
the
quick
patter
of
his
pads
close
up
behind
her
her
knees
weakened
the
sheltering
door
was
yet
some
yards
away
but
a
horse
tethered
near
the
walk
reared
and
snorted
as
the
flying
pair
drew
near
the
mad
creature
swerved
leaped
at
the
horse
s
legs
and
snapped
in
fury
badly
frightened
at
this
attack
the
horse
lunged
at
his
halter
broke
it
and
galloped
away
but
the
delay
had
served
for
helen
weak
and
faint
to
reach
the
door
she
wrenched
at
the
knob
it
was
locked
as
she
turned
hopelessly
away
she
saw
that
the
other
woman
was
directly
behind
her
and
was
in
her
turn
awaiting
the
mad
animal
s
onslaught
but
calmly
a
tiny
revolver
in
her
hand
shoot
screamed
helen
why
don
t
you
shoot
the
little
gun
spoke
and
the
dog
spun
around
snarling
and
yelping
the
woman
fired
several
times
more
before
it
lay
still
and
then
remarked
calmly
as
she
broke
the
weapon
and
ejected
the
shells
the
calibre
is
too
small
to
be
good
for
helen
sank
down
upon
the
steps
how
well
you
shoot
she
gasped
her
eyes
were
on
the
gray
bundle
whose
death
agonies
had
thrust
it
almost
to
her
feet
the
men
had
run
up
and
were
talking
excitedly
but
after
a
word
with
them
the
woman
turned
to
helen
you
must
come
in
for
a
moment
and
recover
yourself
she
said
and
led
her
inside
it
was
a
cosey
room
in
which
the
girl
found
herself
more
than
that
luxurious
there
was
a
piano
with
scattered
music
and
many
of
the
pretty
feminine
things
that
helen
had
not
seen
since
leaving
home
the
hostess
had
stepped
behind
some
curtains
for
an
instant
and
was
talking
to
her
from
the
next
room
that
is
the
third
mad
dog
i
have
seen
this
month
hydrophobia
is
becoming
a
habit
in
this
she
returned
bearing
a
tiny
silver
tray
with
decanter
and
glasses
you
re
all
unstrung
but
this
brandy
will
help
you
if
you
don
t
object
to
a
swallow
of
it
then
come
right
in
here
and
lie
down
for
a
moment
and
you
ll
be
all
she
spoke
with
such
genuine
kindness
and
sympathy
that
helen
flashed
a
grateful
glance
at
her
she
was
tall
slender
and
with
a
peculiar
undulating
suggestion
in
her
movements
as
though
she
had
been
bred
to
the
clinging
folds
of
silken
garments
helen
watched
the
charm
of
her
smile
the
friendly
solicitude
of
her
expression
and
felt
her
heart
warm
towards
this
one
kind
woman
in
nome
you
re
very
good
she
answered
but
i
m
all
right
now
i
was
badly
frightened
it
was
wonderful
your
saving
she
followed
the
other
s
graceful
motion
as
she
placed
her
burden
on
the
table
and
in
doing
so
gazed
squarely
at
a
photograph
of
roy
glenister
oh
helen
exclaimed
then
paused
as
it
flashed
over
her
who
this
girl
was
she
looked
at
her
quickly
yes
probably
men
would
consider
the
woman
beautiful
with
that
smile
the
revelation
came
with
a
shock
and
she
arose
trying
to
mask
her
confusion
thank
you
so
much
for
your
kindness
i
m
quite
myself
now
and
i
must
her
change
of
face
could
not
escape
the
quick
perceptions
of
one
schooled
by
experience
in
the
slights
of
her
sex
times
without
number
cherry
malotte
had
marked
that
subtle
scornful
change
in
other
women
and
reviled
herself
for
heeding
it
but
in
some
way
this
girl
s
manner
hurt
her
worst
of
all
she
betrayed
no
sign
however
save
a
widening
of
the
eyes
and
a
certain
fixity
of
smile
as
she
answered
i
wish
you
would
stay
until
you
are
rested
miss
she
paused
with
hand
chester
my
name
is
helen
chester
i
m
judge
stillman
s
niece
hurried
the
other
in
embarrassment
cherry
malotte
withdrew
her
proffered
hand
and
her
face
grew
hard
and
hateful
oh
so
you
are
miss
chester
and
i
saved
you
she
laughed
harshly
helen
strove
for
calmness
i
m
sorry
you
feel
that
way
she
said
coolly
i
appreciate
your
service
to
she
moved
towards
the
door
wait
a
moment
i
want
to
talk
to
then
as
helen
paid
no
heed
the
woman
burst
out
bitterly
oh
don
t
be
afraid
i
know
you
are
committing
an
unpardonable
sin
by
talking
to
me
but
no
one
will
see
you
and
in
your
code
the
crime
lies
in
being
discovered
therefore
you
re
quite
safe
that
s
what
makes
me
an
outcast
i
was
found
out
i
want
you
to
know
however
that
bad
as
i
am
i
m
better
than
you
for
i
m
loyal
to
those
that
like
me
and
i
don
t
betray
my
i
don
t
pretend
to
understand
you
said
helen
coldly
oh
yes
you
do
don
t
assume
such
innocence
of
course
it
s
your
rôle
but
you
can
t
play
it
with
she
stepped
in
front
of
her
visitor
placing
her
back
against
the
door
while
her
face
was
bitter
and
mocking
the
little
service
i
did
you
just
now
entitles
me
to
a
privilege
i
suppose
and
i
m
going
to
take
advantage
of
it
to
tell
you
how
badly
your
mask
fits
dreadfully
rude
of
me
isn
t
it
you
re
in
with
a
fine
lot
of
crooks
and
i
admire
the
way
you
ve
done
your
share
of
the
dirty
work
but
when
you
assume
these
scandalized
supervirtuous
airs
it
offends
let
me
out
i
ve
done
bad
things
cherry
continued
unheedingly
but
i
was
forced
into
them
usually
and
i
never
deliberately
tried
to
wreck
a
man
s
life
just
for
his
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
i
have
betrayed
my
friends
and
wrecked
anybody
s
life
helen
demanded
hotly
bah
i
had
you
sized
up
at
the
start
but
roy
couldn
t
see
it
then
struve
told
me
what
i
hadn
t
guessed
a
bottle
of
wine
a
woman
and
that
fool
will
tell
all
he
knows
it
s
a
great
game
mcnamara
s
playing
and
he
did
well
to
get
you
in
on
it
for
you
re
clever
your
nerve
is
good
and
your
is
great
for
the
part
i
ought
to
know
for
i
ve
turned
a
few
tricks
myself
you
ll
pardon
this
little
burst
of
feeling
professional
pique
i
m
jealous
of
your
ability
that
s
all
however
now
that
you
realize
we
re
in
the
same
class
don
t
look
down
on
me
she
opened
the
door
and
bowed
her
guest
out
with
elaborate
mockery
helen
was
too
bewildered
and
humiliated
to
make
much
out
of
this
vicious
and
incoherent
attack
except
the
fact
that
cherry
malotte
accused
her
of
a
part
in
this
conspiracy
which
every
one
seemed
to
believe
existed
here
again
was
that
hint
of
corruption
which
she
encountered
on
all
sides
this
might
be
merely
a
woman
s
jealousy
and
yet
she
said
struve
had
told
her
all
about
it
that
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
pretty
face
would
make
the
lawyer
disclose
everything
she
could
believe
it
from
what
she
knew
and
had
heard
of
him
the
feeling
that
she
was
groping
in
the
dark
that
she
was
wrapped
in
a
mysterious
woof
of
secrecy
came
over
her
again
as
it
had
so
often
of
late
if
struve
talked
to
that
other
woman
why
wouldn
t
he
talk
to
her
she
paused
changing
her
direction
towards
front
street
revolving
rapidly
in
her
mind
as
she
went
her
course
of
action
cherry
malotte
believed
her
to
be
an
actress
very
well
she
would
prove
her
judgment
right
she
found
struve
busy
in
his
private
office
but
he
leaped
to
his
feet
on
her
entrance
and
came
forward
offering
her
a
chair
miss
helen
you
have
a
fine
color
considering
the
night
you
passed
the
judge
told
me
all
about
the
affair
and
let
me
state
that
you
re
the
pluckiest
girl
i
she
smiled
grimly
at
the
thought
of
what
made
her
cheeks
glow
and
languidly
loosened
the
buttons
of
her
jacket
i
suppose
you
re
very
busy
you
lawyer
man
she
inquired
yes
but
not
too
busy
to
attend
to
anything
you
oh
i
didn
t
come
on
business
she
said
lightly
i
was
out
walking
and
merely
sauntered
well
i
appreciate
that
all
the
more
he
said
in
an
altered
tone
twisting
his
chair
about
i
m
more
than
she
judged
she
was
getting
on
well
from
the
way
his
professionalism
had
dropped
off
yes
i
get
tired
of
talking
to
uncle
and
mcnamara
they
treat
me
as
though
i
were
a
little
when
do
you
take
the
fatal
step
what
step
do
you
mean
your
marriage
when
does
it
occur
you
needn
t
hesitate
he
added
mcnamara
told
me
about
it
a
month
he
felt
his
throat
gingerly
at
the
thought
but
his
eyes
brightened
when
she
answered
lightly
i
think
you
are
mistaken
he
must
have
been
for
some
time
she
led
him
on
adroitly
talking
of
many
things
in
a
way
to
make
him
wonder
at
her
new
and
flippant
humor
he
had
never
dreamed
she
could
be
like
this
so
tantalizingly
close
to
familiarity
and
yet
so
maddeningly
aloof
and
distant
he
grew
bolder
in
his
speech
how
are
things
going
with
us
she
questioned
as
his
warmth
grew
pronounced
uncle
won
t
talk
and
mcnamara
is
as
as
can
be
he
looked
at
her
quickly
in
what
respect
she
summoned
up
her
courage
and
walked
past
the
ragged
edge
of
uncertainty
now
don
t
you
try
to
keep
me
in
short
dresses
too
it
s
getting
wearisome
i
ve
done
my
part
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
rest
of
you
are
she
was
prepared
for
any
answer
what
do
you
want
to
know
he
asked
cautiously
everything
don
t
you
think
i
can
hear
what
people
are
saying
oh
that
s
it
well
don
t
you
pay
any
attention
to
what
people
she
recognized
her
mistake
and
continued
hurriedly
why
shouldn
t
i
aren
t
we
all
in
this
together
i
object
to
being
used
and
then
discarded
i
think
i
m
entitled
to
know
how
the
scheme
is
working
don
t
you
think
i
can
keep
my
mouth
shut
of
course
he
laughed
trying
to
change
the
subject
of
their
talk
but
she
arose
and
leaned
against
the
desk
near
him
vowing
that
she
would
not
leave
the
office
without
piercing
some
part
of
this
mystery
his
manner
strengthened
her
suspicion
that
there
something
behind
it
all
this
dissipated
brilliant
creature
knew
the
situation
thoroughly
and
yet
though
swayed
by
her
efforts
he
remained
chained
by
caution
she
leaned
forward
and
smiled
at
him
you
re
just
like
the
others
aren
t
you
you
won
t
give
me
any
satisfaction
at
give
give
give
said
struve
cynically
that
s
always
the
woman
s
cry
give
me
this
give
me
that
selfish
sex
why
don
t
you
offer
something
in
return
men
are
traders
women
usurers
you
are
curious
hence
miserable
i
can
help
you
therefore
i
should
do
it
for
a
smile
you
ask
me
to
break
my
promises
and
risk
my
honor
on
your
caprice
well
that
s
and
i
ll
do
it
i
ll
put
myself
in
your
power
but
i
won
t
do
it
gratis
no
we
ll
it
isn
t
curiosity
she
denied
indignantly
it
is
my
no
you
ve
heard
the
common
talk
and
grown
suspicious
that
s
all
you
think
i
know
something
that
will
throw
a
new
light
or
a
new
shadow
on
everything
you
have
in
the
world
and
you
re
worked
up
to
such
a
condition
that
you
can
t
take
your
own
people
s
word
and
on
the
other
hand
you
can
t
go
to
strangers
so
you
come
to
me
suppose
i
told
you
i
had
the
papers
you
brought
to
me
last
spring
in
that
safe
and
that
they
told
the
whole
story
whether
your
uncle
is
unimpeachable
or
whether
he
deserved
hanging
by
that
mob
what
would
you
do
eh
what
would
you
give
to
see
them
well
they
re
there
and
ready
to
speak
for
themselves
if
you
re
a
woman
you
won
t
rest
till
you
ve
seen
them
will
you
trade
yes
yes
give
them
to
me
she
cried
eagerly
at
which
a
wave
of
crimson
rushed
up
to
his
eyes
and
he
rose
abruptly
from
his
chair
he
made
towards
her
but
she
retreated
to
the
wall
pale
and
can
t
you
see
she
flung
at
him
that
i
know
he
paused
of
course
i
can
but
i
want
a
kiss
to
bind
the
bargain
to
apply
on
he
reached
for
her
hand
with
his
own
hot
one
but
she
pushed
him
away
and
slipped
past
him
towards
the
door
suit
yourself
said
he
but
if
i
m
not
mistaken
you
ll
never
rest
till
you
ve
seen
those
papers
i
ve
studied
you
and
i
ll
place
a
bet
that
you
can
t
marry
mcnamara
nor
look
your
uncle
in
the
eye
till
you
know
the
truth
you
might
do
either
if
you
them
to
be
crooks
but
you
couldn
t
if
you
only
suspected
it
that
s
the
woman
when
you
get
ready
come
back
i
ll
show
you
proof
because
i
don
t
claim
to
be
anything
but
what
i
am
wilton
struve
bargainer
of
some
mean
ability
when
they
come
to
inscribe
my
headstone
i
hope
they
can
carve
thereon
with
truth
he
got
value
you
re
a
panther
she
said
loathingly
graceful
and
elegant
brute
that
he
laughed
affectionate
and
full
of
play
but
with
sharp
teeth
and
sharper
claws
to
follow
out
the
idea
which
pleases
me
i
believe
the
creature
owes
no
loyalty
to
its
fellows
and
hunts
alone
now
when
you
ve
followed
this
conspiracy
out
and
placed
the
blame
where
it
belongs
won
t
you
come
and
tell
me
about
it
that
door
leads
into
an
outer
hall
which
opens
into
the
street
no
one
will
see
you
come
or
as
she
hurried
away
she
wondered
dazedly
why
she
had
stayed
to
listen
so
long
what
a
monster
he
was
his
meaning
was
plain
had
always
been
so
from
the
first
day
he
laid
eyes
upon
her
and
he
was
utterly
conscienceless
she
had
known
all
this
and
yet
in
her
proud
youthful
confidence
and
in
her
need
every
hour
more
desperate
and
urgent
to
know
the
truth
she
had
dared
risk
herself
with
him
withal
the
man
was
shrewd
and
observant
and
had
divined
her
mental
condition
with
remarkable
sagacity
she
had
failed
with
him
but
the
girl
now
knew
that
she
could
never
rest
till
she
found
an
answer
to
her
questions
she
kill
this
suspicion
that
ate
into
her
so
she
thought
tenderly
of
her
uncle
s
goodness
to
her
clung
with
despairing
faith
to
the
last
of
her
kin
the
blood
ties
of
the
chesters
were
close
and
she
felt
in
dire
need
of
that
lost
brother
who
was
somewhere
in
this
mysterious
land
need
of
some
one
in
whom
ran
the
strain
that
bound
her
to
the
weak
old
man
up
yonder
there
was
mcnamara
but
how
could
he
help
her
how
much
did
she
know
of
him
this
man
who
was
now
within
the
darkest
shadow
of
her
new
suspicions
feeling
almost
intolerably
friendless
and
alone
weakened
both
by
her
recent
fright
and
by
her
encounter
with
struve
helen
considered
as
calmly
as
her
emotions
would
allow
and
decided
that
this
was
no
day
in
which
pride
should
figure
there
were
facts
which
it
was
imperative
she
should
know
and
immediately
therefore
a
few
minutes
later
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
cherry
malotte
when
the
girl
appeared
helen
was
astonished
to
see
that
she
had
been
crying
tears
burn
hottest
and
leave
plainest
trace
in
eyes
where
they
come
most
seldom
the
younger
girl
could
not
guess
the
tumult
of
emotion
the
other
had
undergone
during
her
absence
the
utter
depths
of
she
had
fathomed
for
the
sight
of
helen
and
her
fresh
young
beauty
had
roused
in
the
adventuress
a
very
tempest
of
bitterness
and
jealousy
whether
helen
chester
were
guilty
or
innocent
how
could
glenister
hesitate
between
them
cherry
had
asked
herself
now
she
stared
at
her
visitor
inhospitably
and
without
sign
will
you
let
me
come
in
helen
asked
her
i
have
something
to
say
to
when
they
were
inside
cherry
malotte
stood
and
gazed
at
her
visitor
with
inscrutable
eyes
and
stony
face
it
isn
t
easy
for
me
to
come
back
helen
began
but
i
felt
that
i
had
to
if
you
can
help
me
i
hope
you
will
you
said
that
you
knew
a
great
wrong
was
being
done
i
have
suspected
it
but
i
didn
t
know
and
i
ve
been
afraid
to
doubt
my
own
people
you
said
i
had
a
part
in
it
that
i
d
betrayed
my
friends
wait
a
moment
she
hurried
on
at
the
other
s
cynical
smile
won
t
you
tell
me
what
you
know
and
what
you
think
my
part
has
been
i
ve
heard
and
seen
things
that
make
me
think
oh
they
make
me
afraid
to
think
and
yet
i
can
t
find
the
you
see
in
a
struggle
like
this
people
will
make
all
sorts
of
allegations
but
do
they
have
they
any
proof
that
my
uncle
has
done
wrong
is
that
all
no
you
said
struve
told
you
the
whole
scheme
i
went
to
him
and
tried
to
cajole
the
story
out
of
him
but
she
shivered
at
the
memory
what
success
did
you
have
inquired
the
listener
oddly
curious
for
all
her
cold
dislike
don
t
ask
me
i
hate
to
think
of
cherry
laughed
cruelly
so
failing
there
you
came
back
to
me
back
for
another
favor
from
the
waif
well
miss
helen
chester
i
don
t
believe
a
word
you
ve
said
and
i
ll

you
nothing

the
uncle
and
the
rawboned
lover
who
sent
you
and
inform
them
that
i
ll
speak
when
the
time
comes
they
think
i
know
too
much
do
they
so
they
ve
sent
you
to
spy
well
i
ll
make
a
compact

play
your
game
and
i

a
bargain
no

truth
of
this
then

and

tell
you
i
won
t
drive
your
bargain
with
him
you
re
able
you
ve
fooled
better
men
now
see
what
you
can
do
with
helen
left
realizing
the
futility
of
further
effort
though
she
felt
that
this
woman
did
not
really
doubt
her
but
was
scourged
by
jealousy
till
she
deliberately
chose
this
attitude
reaching
her
own
house
she
wrote
two
brief
notes
and
called
in
her
jap
boy
from
the
kitchen
fred
i
want
you
to
hunt
up
glenister
and

note

dear
miss
chester
a
discussion
of
a
matter
so
familiar
to
us
both
as
the
anvil
creek
controversy
would
be
useless
if
your
inclination
is
due
to
the
incidents
of
last
night
pray
don
t
trouble
yourself
we
don
t
want
your
pity
i
am
right
your
servant
roy
as
she
read
the
note
judge
stillman
entered
and
it
seemed
to
the
girl
that
he
had
aged
a
year
for
every
hour
in
the
last
twelve
or
else
the
yellow
afternoon
light
limned
the
sagging
hollows
and
haggard
lines
of
his
face
most
pitilessly
he
showed
in
voice
and
manner
the
nervous
burden
under
which
he
labored
alec
has
told
me
about
your
engagement
and
it
lifts
a
terrible
load
from
me
i
m
mighty
glad
you
re
going
to
marry
him
he
s
a
wonderful
man
and
he
s
the
only
one
who
can
save
what
do
you
mean
by
that
what
are
we
in
danger
of
she
inquired
avoiding
discussion
of
mcnamara
s
announcement
why
that
mob
of
course
they
ll
come
back
they
said
so
but
alec
can
handle
the
commanding
officer
at
the
post
and
thanks
to
him
we
ll
have
soldiers
guarding
the
house
why
they
won
t
hurt
us
tut
tut
i
know
what
i
m
talking
about
we
re
in
worse
danger
now
than
ever
and
if
we
don
t
break
up
those
vigilantes
there
ll
be
bloodshed
that
s
what
they
re
a
menace
and
they
re
trying
to
force
me
off
the
bench
so
they
can
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
again
that
s
what
i
want
to
see
you
about
they
re
planning
to
kill
alec
and
me
so
he
says
and
we
ve
got
to
act
quick
to
prevent
murder
now
this
young
glenister
is
one
of
them
and
he
knows
who
the
rest
are
do
you
think
you
could
get
him
to
talk
i
don
t
think
i
quite
understand
you
said
the
girl
through
whitening
lips
oh
yes
you
do
i
want
the
names
of
the
so
that
i
can
jail
them
you
can
worm
it
out
of
that
fellow
if
you
helen
looked
at
the
old
man
in
a
horror
that
at
first
was
dumb
you
ask
this
of
me
she
demanded
hoarsely
at
last
nonsense
he
said
irritably
this
isn
t
any
time
for
silly
scruples
it
s
life
or
death
for
me
maybe
and
for
alec
he
said
the
last
craftily
but
she
stormed
at
him
it
s
infamous
you
re
asking
me
to
betray
the
very
man
who
saved
us
not
twelve
hours
ago
he
risked
his
life
for
it
isn
t
treachery
at
all
it
s
protection
if
we
don
t
get
them
they
ll
get
us
i
wouldn
t
punish
that
young
fellow
but
i
want
the
others
come
now
you
ve
got
to
do
but
she
said
no
firmly
and
quietly
went
to
her
own
room
where
behind
the
locked
door
she
sat
for
a
long
time
staring
with
unseeing
eyes
her
hands
tight
clenched
in
her
lap
at
last
she
whispered
i
m
afraid
it
s
true
i
m
afraid
it
s
she
remained
hidden
during
the
and
pleaded
a
headache
when
mcnamara
called
in
the
early
evening
although
she
had
not
seen
him
since
he
left
her
the
night
before
bearing
her
tacit
promise
to
wed
him
yet
how
could
she
meet
him
now
with
the
conviction
growing
on
her
hourly
that
he
was
a
she
wrestled
with
the
thought
that
he
and
her
uncle
her
own
uncle
who
stood
in
the
place
of
a
father
were
conspirators
and
yet
at
memory
of
the
judge
s
request
that
she
should
turn
traitress
her
whole
being
was
revolted
if
he
could
ask
a
thing
like
that
what
other
heartless
selfish
act
might
he
not
be
capable
of
all
the
long
solitary
evening
she
kept
her
room
but
at
last
feeling
faint
slipped
in
search
of
fred
for
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
her
late
breakfast
voices
reached
her
from
the
parlor
and
as
she
came
to
the
last
step
she
froze
there
in
an
attitude
of
listening
the
first
sentence
she
heard
through
the
curtains
banished
all
qualms
at
eavesdropping
she
stood
for
many
breathless
minutes
drinking
in
the
plot
that
came
to
her
plainly
from
within
then
turned
gathered
up
her
skirts
and
tiptoed
back
to
her
room
here
she
made
haste
madly
tearing
off
her
house
clothes
and
donning
others
she
pressed
her
face
to
the
window
and
noted
that
the
night
was
like
a
velvet
pall
without
a
star
in
sight
nevertheless
she
wound
a
heavy
veil
about
her
hat
and
face
before
she
extinguished
the
light
and
stepped
into
the
hall
hearing
mcnamara
s
at
the
she
retreated
again
while
her
uncle
slowly
mounted
the
stairs
and
paused
before
her
chamber
he
called
her
name
softly
but
when
she
did
not
answer
continued
on
to
his
own
room
when
he
was
safely
within
she
descended
quietly
went
out
and
locked
the
behind
her
placing
the
key
in
her
bosom
she
hurried
now
feeling
her
way
through
the
thick
gloom
in
a
panic
while
in
her
mind
was
but
one
frightened

i

chapter

the
drip
of
water
in
the
dark
even
after
helen
had
been
out
for
some
time
she
could
barely
see
sufficiently
to
avoid
collisions
the
air
weighted
by
a
roof
of
clouds
was
surcharged
with
the
electric
suspense
of
an
impending
storm
and
seemed
to
sigh
and
tremble
at
the
hint
of
power
in
leash
it
was
that
pause
before
the
conflict
wherein
the
night
laid
finger
upon
its
lips
as
the
girl
neared
glenister
s
cabin
she
was
disappointed
at
seeing
no
light
there
she
stumbled
towards
the
door
only
to
utter
a
cry
as
two
men
stepped
out
of
the
gloom
and
seized
her
roughly
something
cold
and
hard
was
thrust
violently
against
her
cheek
forcing
her
head
back
and
bruising
her
she
struggled
and
cried
out
hold
on
it
s
a
woman
ejaculated
the
man
who
had
pinioned
her
arms
loosing
his
hold
till
only
a
hand
remained
on
her
shoulder
the
other
lowered
the
weapon
he
had
jammed
to
her
face
and
peered
closely
why
miss
chester
he
said
what
are
you
doing
here
you
came
near
getting
i
am
bound
for
the
wilsons
but
i
must
have
lost
my
way
in
the
darkness
i
think
you
have
cut
my
she
controlled
her
fright
firmly
that
s
too
bad
one
said
we
mistook
you
for
and
the
other
broke
in
sharply
you
d
better
run
along
we
re
waiting
for
some
helen
hastened
back
by
the
route
she
had
come
knowing
that
there
was
still
time
and
that
as
yet
her
uncle
s
emissaries
had
not
laid
hands
upon
glenister
she
had
overheard
the
judge
and
mcnamara
plotting
to
drag
the
town
with
a
force
of
deputies
seizing
not
only
her
two
friends
but
every
man
suspected
of
being
a
vigilante
the
victims
were
to
be
jailed
without
bond
without
reason
without
justice
while
the
mechanism
of
the
court
was
to
be
juggled
in
order
to
hold
them
until
fall
if
necessary
they
had
said
that
the
officers
were
already
busy
so
haste
was
a
crying
thing
she
sped
down
the
dark
streets
towards
the
house
of
cherry
malotte
but
found
no
light
nor
answer
to
her
knock
she
was
distracted
now
and
knew
not
where
to
seek
next
among
the
thousand
spots
which
might
hide
the
man
she
wanted
what
chance
had
she
against
the
posse
sweeping
the
town
from
end
to
end
there
was
only
one
he
might
be
at
the
northern
theatre
even
so
she
could
not
reach
him
for
she
dared
not
go
there
herself
she
thought
of
fred
her
jap
boy
but
there
was
no
time
wasted
moments
meant
failure
roy
had
once
told
her
that
he
never
gave
up
what
he
undertook
very
well
she
would
show
that
even
a
girl
may
possess
determination
this
was
no
time
for
modesty
or
shrinking
indecision
so
she
pulled
the
veil
more
closely
about
her
face
and
took
her
good
name
into
her
hands
she
made
rapidly
towards
the
lighted
streets
which
cast
a
skyward
glare
and
from
which
through
the
breathless
calm
arose
the
sound
of
carousal
swiftly
she
threaded
the
narrow
alleys
in
search
of
the
theatre
s
rear
entrance
for
she
dared
not
approach
from
the
front
in
this
way
she
came
into
a
part
of
the
camp
which
had
lain
hidden
from
her
until
now
and
of
the
existence
of
which
she
had
never
dreamed
the
vices
of
a
city
however
horrible
are
at
least
draped
scantily
by
the
mantle
of
convention
but
in
a
great
they
stand
naked
and
without
concealment
here
there
were
rows
upon
rows
of
criblike
houses
clustered
over
tortuous
lanes
like
swarming
to
an
unclean
feast
from
within
came
the
noise
of
ribaldry
and
debauch
shrill
laughter
mingled
with
coarse
maudlin
songs
till
the
clinging
night
reeked
with
abominable
revelry
the
girl
saw
painted
creatures
of
every
nationality
leaning
from
windows
or
beckoning
from
doorways
while
drunken
men
collided
with
her
barred
her
course
challenged
her
and
again
and
again
she
was
forced
to
slip
from
their
embraces
at
last
the
high
bulk
of
the
theatre
building
loomed
a
short
distance
ahead
panting
and
frightened
she
tried
the
door
with
weak
hands
to
find
it
locked
from
behind
it
rose
the
blare
of
brass
and
the
sound
of
singing
she
accosted
a
man
who
approached
her
through
the
narrow
alley
but
he
had
cruised
from
the
charted
course
in
search
of
adventure
and
was
not
minded
to
go
in
quest
of
doormen
rather
he
chose
to
sing
a
chantey
to
the
bibulous
measures
of
which
he
invited
her
to
dance
with
him
so
she
slipped
away
till
he
had
teetered
past
he
was
some
in
that
particular
epoch
of
his
inebriety
where
life
had
no
burden
save
the
dissipation
of
wages
returning
she
pounded
on
the
door
possessed
of
the
sense
that
the
man
she
sought
was
here
till
at
last
it
was
flung
open
framing
the
silhouette
of
a
youth
who
shouted
what
n
ell
do
you
want
to
butt
in
for
while
the
show
s
on
go
round
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
disordered
scenery
and
before
he
could
slam
the
door
in
her
face
thrust
a
silver
dollar
into
his
hand
at
the
same
time
wedging
herself
into
the
opening
he
pocketed
the
coin
and
the
door
clicked
to
behind
her
well
speak
up
the
act
s
closin
evidently
he
was
the
directing
genius
of
the
performance
for
at
that
moment
the
chorus
broke
into
full
cry
and
he
said
hurriedly
wait
a
minute
there
goes
the
finally
and
dashed
away
to
tend
his
drops
and
switches
when
the
curtain
was
down
and
the
principals
had
sought
their
he
returned
do
you
know
glenister
she
asked
sure
i
seen
him
come
he
led
her
towards
the
footlights
and
pulling
back
the
edge
of
the
curtain
allowed
her
to
peep
past
him
out
into
the
she
had
never
pictured
a
place
like
this
and
in
spite
of
her
agitation
was
astonished
at
its
gaudy
elegance
the
gallery
was
formed
of
a
continuous
row
of
compartments
with
curtained
fronts
in
which
men
and
women
were
talking
drinking
singing
the
seats
on
the
lower
floor
were
disappearing
and
the
canvas
cover
was
rolling
back
showing
the
polished
hardwood
underneath
while
out
through
the
wide
that
led
to
the
main
she
heard
a
man
calling
the
commencement
of
the
dance
couples
glided
into
motion
while
she
watched
i
don
t
see
him
said
her
guide
you
better
walk
out
front
and
help
he
indicated
the
stairs
which
led
up
to
the
galleried
boxes
and
the
steps
leading
down
on
to
the
main
floor
but
she
handed
him
another
coin
begging
him
to
find
glenister
and
bring
him
to
her
hurry
hurry
she
implored
the
gazed
at
her
curiously
remarking
my

your
money
like
it
had
been
left
to
you
you
re
a
regular
for
me
come
around
any
she
withdrew
to
a
dark
corner
and
waited
interminably
till
her
messenger
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
gallery
stairs
and
beckoned
to
her
as
she
drew
near
he
said
i
told
him
there
was
a
filly
flaggin
him
from
the
stage
door
but
he
s
got
a
grouch
an
won
t
stir

s
in

she
hesitated
at
which
he
said

then
continued
reassuringly

naw
take
it
from
she
entered
the
door
her
counsellor
indicated
to
find
roy
lounging
back
watching
the
dancers
he
turned
inquiringly
then
as
she
raised
her
veil
leaped
to
his
feet
and
jerked
the
curtains
to
helen
what
are
you
doing
here
you
must
go
away
quickly
she
gasped
they
re
trying
to
arrest
they
who

what
voorhees
and
his
men

or
something
about

said

a
vigilante
and
they

after

other
and

indefinitely

he
asked
gravely
i
overheard
them
who
uncle
arthur
and
she
faced
him
squarely
as
she
said
it
and
therefore
saw
the
light
flame
up
in
his
eyes
as
he
cried
and
you
came
here
to
save
me
came
at
the
risk
of
your
good
name
of
course
i
would
have
done

gladness

leaving

listless

frisco
courts
about

cases

know
that
it
s
worth
while
to
fight

listen
she
said

is
a
terrible
wrong
being
done
and
you
and
i
must
stop
it
i

truth
at

and

time

well
if

sides

some
hope
left
thank
you
for
the
risk
you
ran
in
warning
she
had
moved
to
the
front
of
the
compartment
and
was
peering
forth
between
the
draperies
when
she
stifled
a
cry
too
late
too
late
there
they
are
don
t
part
the
curtains
they
ll
see
pushing
through
the
were
voorhees
and
four
others
seemingly
in
quest
of
some
one
run
down
the
back
stairs
she
breathed
and
pushed
him
through
the
door
he
caught
and
held
her
hand
with
a
last
word
of
gratitude
then
he
was
gone
she
drew
down
her
veil
and
was
about
to
follow
when
the
door
opened
and
he
reappeared
no
use
he
remarked
quietly
there
are
three
more
waiting
at
the
he
looked
out
to
find
that
the
officers
had
searched
the
crowd
and
were
turning
towards
the
front
stairs
thus
cutting
off
his
retreat
there
were
but
two
ways
down
from
the
gallery
and
no
outside
windows
from
which
to
leap
as
they
had
made
no
armed
display
the
presence
of
the
officers
had
not
interrupted
the
dance
glenister
drew
his
revolver
while
into
his
eyes
came
the
dancing
glitter
that
helen
had
seen
before
cold
as
the
glint
of
winter
sunlight
no
not
that
for
god
s
sake
she
shuddered
clasping
his
arm
i
must
for
your
sake
or
they
ll
find
you
here
and
that
s
worse
than
ruin
i
ll
fight
it
out
in
the
corridors
so
that
you
can
escape
in
the
confusion
wait
till
the
firing
stops
and
the
crowd
his
hand
was
on
the
knob
when
she
tore
it
loose
whispering
hoarsely
they
ll
kill
you
wait
there
s
a
better
way
she
dragged
him
to
the
front
of
the
box
and
pulled
aside
the
curtains
it
isn
t
high
and
they
won
t
see
you
till
it
s
too
late
then
you
can
run
through
the
he
grasped
her
idea
and
slipping
his
weapon
back
into
its
holster
laid
hold
of
the
ledge
before
him
and
lowered
himself
down
over
the
dancers
he
swung
out
unhesitatingly
and
almost
before
he
had
been
observed
had
dropped
into
their
midst
the
gallery
was
but
twice
the
height
of
a
man
s
head
from
the
floor
so
he
landed
on
his
feet
and
had
drawn
his
colt
s
even
while
the
men
at
the
stairs
were
shouting
at
him
to
halt
at
sight
of
the
naked
weapons
there
was
confusion
wherein
the
commands
of
the
deputies
mingled
with
the
shrieks
of
the
women
the
crash
of
overturned
chairs
and
the
sound
of
tramping
feet
as
the
crowd
divided
before
glenister
and
swept
back
against
the
wall
in
the
same
ominous
way
that
a
crowd
in
the
street
had
once
divided
on
the
morning
of
helen
s
arrival
the
trombone
player
who
had
sunk
low
in
his
chair
with
closed
eyes
looked
out
suddenly
at
the
disturbance
and
his
alarm
was
blown
through
the
horn
in
a
startled
squawk
a
large
woman
whimpered
don
t
shoot
and
thrust
her
palms
to
her
ears
closing
her
eyes
tightly
glenister
covered
the
deputies
from
whose
vicinity
the
surged
as
though
from
the
presence
of
lepers
hands
up
he
cried
sharply
and
they
froze
into
motionless
attitudes
one
poised
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
stairs
the
other
a
pace
forward
voorhees
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
flight
and
rushed
down
a
few
steps
only
to
come
abruptly
into
range
and
to
assume
a
like
rigidity
for
the
young
man
s
aim
shifted
to
him
i
have
a
warrant
for
you
the
officer
cried
his
voice
loud
in
the
hush
keep
it
said
glenister
showing
his
teeth
in
a
smile
in
which
there
was
no
mirth
he
backed
diagonally
across
the
hall
his
clicking
in
the
silence
his
eyes
shifting
rapidly
up
and
down
the
stairs
where
the
danger
lay
from
her
station
helen
could
see
the
whole
tableau
all
but
the
men
on
the
stairs
where
her
vision
was
cut
off
she
saw
the
dance
girls
crouched
behind
their
partners
or
leaning
far
out
from
the
wall
with
parted
lips
the
men
eager
yet
fearful
the
bartender
with
a
glass
poised
high
then
a
quick
movement
across
the
hall
suddenly
diverted
her
absorbed
attention
she
saw
a
man
rip
aside
the
drapery
of
the
box
opposite
and
lean
so
far
out
that
he
seemed
in
peril
of
falling
he
undertook
to
sight
a
weapon
at
glenister
who
was
just
passing
from
his
view
at
her
first
glance
helen
gasped
her
heart
gave
one
fierce
lunge
and
she
cried
out
the
distance
across
the
pit
was
so
short
that
she
saw
his
every
line
and
lineament
clearly
it
was
the
brother
she
had
sought
these
years
and
years
before
she
knew
or
could
check
it
the
blood
call
leaped
forth
drury
she
cried
aloud
at
which
he
whipped
his
head
about
while
amazement
and
some
other
emotion
she
could
not
gauge
spread
slowly
over
his
features
for
a
long
moment
he
stared
at
her
without
movement
or
sign
while
the
drama
beneath
went
on
then
he
drew
back
into
his
retreat
with
the
dazed
look
of
one
doubting
his
senses
yet
fearful
of
putting
them
to
the
test
for
her
part
she
saw
nothing
except
her
brother
vanishing
slowly
into
the
shadows
as
though
stricken
at
her
glance
the
curtains
closing
before
his
livid
face
and
then
pandemonium
broke
loose
at
her
feet
glenister
holding
his
enemies
at
bay
had
retreated
to
the
double
doors
leading
to
the
theatre
his
coup
had
been
executed
so
quickly
and
with
such
lack
of
turmoil
that
the
throng
outside
knew
nothing
of
it
till
they
saw
a
man
walk
backward
through
the
door
as
he
did
so
he
reached
forth
and
slammed
the
wide
wings
shut
before
his
face
then
turned
and
dashed
into
the
press
inside
the
loud
sounds
arose
as
the
officers
clattered
down
the
stairs
and
made
after
their
quarry
they
tore
the
barrier
apart
in
time
to
see
far
down
the
saloon
an
eddying
swirl
as
though
some
great
fish
were
lashing
through
the
of
a
pond
and
then
the
swinging
doors
closed
behind
glenister
helen
made
her
way
from
the
theatre
as
she
had
come
unobserved
and
unobserving
but
she
walked
in
a
dream
emotions
had
chased
each
other
too
closely
to
be
distinguishable
so
she
went
mechanically
through
the
narrow
alley
to
front
street
and
thence
to
her
home
glenister
meanwhile
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
darkness
the
night
enfolding
him
without
sign
or
trace
as
he
ran
he
considered
what
course
to
follow
whether
to
carry
the
call
to
his
comrades
in
town
or
to
make
for
the
creek
and
dextry
the
vigilantes
might
still
distrust
him
and
yet
he
owed
them
warning
mcnamara
s
men
were
moving
so
swiftly
that
action
must
be
speedy
to
forestall
them
another
hour
and
the
net
would
be
closed
while
it
seemed
that
whichever
course
he
chose
they
would
snare
one
or
the
other
either
the
friends
who
remained
in
town
or
dex
and
slapjack
out
in
the
hills
with
daylight
those
two
would
return
and
walk
unheeding
into
the
trap
while
if
he
bore
the
word
to
them
first
then
the
vigilantes
would
be
jailed
before
dawn
as
he
drew
near
cherry
malotte
s
house
he
saw
a
light
through
the
drawn
curtains
a
heavy
raindrop
plashed
upon
his
face
another
followed
and
then
he
heard
the
patter
of
falling
water
increasing
swiftly
before
he
could
gain
the
door
the
storm
had
broken
it
swept
up
the
street
with
tropical
violence
while
a
breath
sighed
out
of
the
night
lifting
the
litter
from
underfoot
and
pelting
him
with
flying
particles
over
the
roofs
the
wind
rushed
with
the
rising
moan
of
a
hurricane
while
the
night
grew
suddenly
noisy
ahead
of
the
tempest
he
entered
the
door
without
knocking
to
find
the
girl
removing
her
coat
her
face
gladdened
at
sight
of
him
but
he
checked
her
with
quick
and
cautious
words
his
speech
almost
drowned
by
the
roar
outside
are
you
alone
she
nodded
and
he
slipped
the
bolt
behind
him
saying
the
marshals
are
after
me
we
just
had
a
run
in
at
the
northern
and
i
m
on
the
go
no
nothing
serious
yet
but
they
want
the
vigilantes
and
i
must
get
them
word
will
you
help
me
he
rapidly
recounted
the
row
of
the
last
ten
minutes
while
she
nodded
her
quick
understanding
you
re
safe
here
for
a
little
while
she
told
him
for
the
storm
will
check
them
if
they
should
come
there
s
a
back
door
leading
out
from
the
kitchen
and
a
side
entrance
yonder
in
my
room
you
ll
find
a
french
window
they
can
t
corner
you
very
slapjack
and
dex
are
out
at
the
shaft
house
you
know
that
quartz
claim
on
the
mountain
above
the
he
hesitated
will
you
lend
me
your
it
s
a
black
night
and
i
may
kill
what
about
these
men
in
town
i
ll
warn
them
first
then
hit
for
the
she
shook
her
head
you
can
t
do
it
you
can
t
get
out
there
before
daylight
if
you
wait
to
rouse
these
people
and
mcnamara
has
probably
telephoned
the
mines
to
send
a
party
up
to
the
quartz
claim
after
dex
he
knows
where
the
old
man
is
as
well
as
you
do
and
they
ll
raid
him
before
i
m
afraid
so
but
it
s
all
i
can
offer
will
you
give
me
the
horse
no
he
s
only
a
pony
and
you
d
founder
him
in
the
tundra
the
mud
is
i
ll
go
good
heavens
girl
in
such
a
night
why
it
s
worth
your
life
listen
to
it
the
creeks
will
be
up
and
you
ll
have
to
swim
no
i
can
t
let
he
s
a
good
little
horse
and
he
ll
take
me
then
coming
close
she
continued
oh
boy
can
t
you
see
that
i
want
to
help
can
t
you
see
that
i
i
d
for
you
if
it
would
do
any
good
he
gazed
gravely
into
her
wide
blue
eyes
and
said
awkwardly
yes
i
know
i
m
sorry
things
are
as
they
are
but
you
wouldn
t
have
me
lie
to
you
little
woman
no
you
re
the
only
true
man
i
ever
knew
i
guess
that
s
why
i
love
you
and
i
do
love
you
oh
so
much
i
want
to
be
good
and
worthy
to
love
you
she
laid
her
face
against
his
arm
and
caressed
him
with
clinging
tenderness
while
the
wind
yelled
loudly
about
the
eaves
and
the
windows
drummed
beneath
the
rain
his
heavy
brows
knit
themselves
together
as
she
whispered
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
with
such
an
agony
of
longing
in
her
voice
that
her
soft
accents
were
sharply
distinguishable
above
the
turmoil
the
growing
wildness
seemed
a
part
of
the
woman
s
passion
which
whipped
and
harried
her
like
a
willow
in
a
blast
things
are
fearfully
jumbled
he
said
finally
and
this
is
a
bad
time
to
talk
about
them
i
wish
they
might
be
different
no
other
girl
would
do
what
you
have
offered
then
why
do
you
think
of
that
woman
she
broke
in
fiercely
she
s
bad
and
false
she
betrayed
you
once
she
s
in
the
play
now
you
ve
told
me
so
yourself
why
don
t
you
be
a
man
and
forget
her
i
can
t
he
said
simply
you
re
wrong
though
when
you
think
she
s
bad
i
found
that
she
s
good
and
brave
and
honest
the
part
she
played
was
played
innocently
i
m
sure
of
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
ll
marry
mcnamara
it
was
she
who
overheard
them
plotting
and
risked
her
reputation
to
warn
cherry
s
face
whitened
while
the
shadowy
eagerness
that
had
rested
there
died
utterly
she
came
into
that
dive
alone
she
did
that
he
nodded
at
which
she
stood
thinking
for
some
time
then
continued
you
re
honest
with
me
roy
and
i
ll
be
the
same
with
you
i
m
tired
of
deceit
tired
of
everything
i
tried
to
make
you
think
she
was
bad
but
in
my
own
heart
i
knew
differently
all
the
time
she
came
here
and
humbled
herself
to
get
the
truth
humbled
herself
to
and
i
sent
her
away
she
suspected
but
she
didn
t
know
and
when
she
asked
for
information
i
insulted
her
that
s
the
kind
of
a
creature
i
am
i
sent
her
back
to
struve
who
offered
to
tell
her
the
whole
what
does
that
renegade
want
can
t
you
guess
why
i
d
rather
the
young
man
ground
his
teeth
but
cherry
hastened
you
needn
t
worry
she
won
t
see
him
again
she
loathes
the
ground
he
walks
and
yet
he
s
no
worse
than
that
other
scoundrel
come
girl
we
have
work
to
do
we
must
act
and
act
he
gave
her
his
message
to
dextry
then
she
went
to
her
room
and
slipped
into
a
when
she
came
out
he
asked
where
is
your
you
ll
be
drenched
in
no
i
can
t
ride
with
it
i
ll
be
thrown
anyway
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
all
bound
up
water
won
t
hurt
she
thrust
her
tiny
revolver
into
her
dress
but
he
took
it
and
upon
examination
shook
his
head
if
you
need
a
gun
you
ll
need
a
good
he
removed
the
belt
from
his
own
waist
and
buckled
his
colt
s
about
her
but
you
she
objected
i
ll
get
another
in
ten
then
as
they
were
leaving
he
said
one
other
request
cherry
i
ll
be
in
hiding
for
a
time
and
i
must
get
word
to
miss
chester
to
keep
watch
of
her
uncle
for
the
big
fight
is
on
at
last
and
the
boys
will
hang
him
sure
if
they
catch
him
i
owe
her
this
last
warning
will
you
send
it
to
her
i
ll
do
it
for
your
sake
not
for
her
no
no
i
don
t
mean
that
i
ll
do
the
right
thing
all
round
leave
it
here
and
i
ll
see
that
she
gets
it
and
roy
be
careful
of
her
eyes
were
starry
and
in
their
depths
lurked
neither
selfishness
nor
jealousy
now
only
that
mysterious
glory
of
a
woman
who
makes
sacrifice
together
they
scurried
back
to
the
stable
and
yet
in
that
short
distance
she
would
have
been
swept
from
her
feet
had
he
not
seized
her
they
blew
in
through
the
barn
door
streaming
and
soaked
by
the
blinding
sheets
that
drove
scythelike
ahead
of
the
wind
he
struck
a
light
and
the
pony
whinnied
at
recognition
of
his
mistress
she
stroked
the
little
fellow
s
muzzle
while
glenister
cinched
on
her
saddle
then
when
she
was
at
last
mounted
she
leaned
forward
will
you
kiss
me
once
roy
for
the
last
time
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
and
kissed
her
upon
the
lips
as
he
would
have
saluted
a
little
maid
as
he
did
so
unseen
by
both
of
them
a
face
was
pressed
for
an
instant
against
the
pane
of
glass
in
the
stable
wall
you
re
a
brave
girl
and
may
god
bless
you
he
said
extinguishing
the
light
he
flung
the
door
wide
and
she
rode
out
into
the
storm
locking
the
portal
he
plunged
back
towards
the
house
to
write
his
hurried
note
for
there
was
much
to
do
and
scant
time
for
its
accomplishment
despite
the
helping
hand
of
the
hurricane
he
heard
the
voice
of
bering
as
it
thundered
on
the
golden
sands
and
knew
that
the
first
great
storm
of
the
fall
had
come
henceforth
he
saw
that
the
violence
of
men
would
rival
the
rising
elements
for
the
deeds
of
this
night
would
stir
their
passions
as
æolus
was
rousing
the
hate
of
the
sea
he
neglected
to
bolt
the
house
door
as
he
entered
but
flung
off
his
dripping
coat
and
seizing
pad
and
pencil
scrawled
his
message
the
wind
screamed
about
the
cabin
the
lamp
flared
smokily
and
glenister
felt
a
draught
suck
past
him
as
though
from
an
open
door
at
his
back
as
he
wrote
i
can
t
do
anything
more
the
end
has
come
and
it
has
brought
the
hatred
and
bloodshed
that
i
have
been
trying
to
prevent
i
played
the
game
according
to
your
rules
but
they
forced
me
back
to
first
principles
in
spite
of
myself
and
now
i
don
t
know
what
the
finish
will
be
will
tell
take
care
of
your
uncle
and
if
you
should
wish
to
communicate
with
me
go
to
cherry
malotte
she
is
a
friend
to
both
of
us
always
your
servant
roy
as
he
sealed
this
he
paused
while
he
felt
the
hair
on
his
neck
rise
and
bristle
and
a
chill
race
up
his
spine
his
heart
fluttered
then
pounded
onward
till
the
blood
thumped
audibly
at
his
and
he
found
himself
swaying
in
rhythm
to
its
beat
the
muscles
of
his
back
cringed
and
rippled
at
the
proximity
of
some
hovering
peril
and
yet
an
irresistible
feeling
forbade
him
to
turn
a
sound
came
from
close
behind
his
chair
the
drip
drip
drip
of
water
it
was
not
from
the
caves
nor
yet
from
a
faulty
shingle
his
back
was
to
the
kitchen
door
through
which
he
had
come
and
although
there
were
no
mirrors
before
him
he
felt
a
menacing
presence
as
surely
as
though
it
had
touched
him
his
ears
were
tuned
to
the
finest
of
sound
so
that
he
heard
the
faint
sighing
squish
of
a
sodden
shoe
upon
which
a
weight
had
shifted
still
something
chained
him
to
his
seat
it
was
as
though
his
soul
laid
a
restraining
hand
upon
his
body
waiting
for
the
instant
he
let
his
hand
seek
his
hip
carelessly
but
remembered
where
his
gun
was
mechanically
he
addressed
the
note
in
shaking
characters
while
behind
him
sounded
the
constant
drip
drip
drip
that
he
knew
came
from
saturated
garments
for
a
long
moment
he
sat
till
he
heard
the
stealthy
click
of
a
muffled
by
finger
pressure
then
he
set
his
face
and
slowly
turned
to
find
the
bronco
kid
standing
behind
him
as
though
risen
from
the
sea
his
light
clothes
wet
and
clinging
his
feet
centred
in
a
spreading
puddle
the
dim
light
showed
the
convulsive
fury
of
his
features
above
the
levelled
weapon
whose
hammer
was
curled
back
like
the
head
of
a
striking
adder
his
eyes
gleaming
with
frenzy
glenister
s
mouth
was
powder
dry
but
his
mind
was
leaping
riotously
like
dust
before
a
gale
for
he
divined
himself
to
be
in
the
deadliest
peril
of
his
life
when
he
spoke
the
calmness
of
his
voice
surprised
himself
what
s
the
matter
bronco
the
kid
made
no
reply
and
roy
repeated
what
do
you
want
that
s
a
hell
of
a
question
the
gambler
said
hoarsely
i
want
you
of
course
and
i
ve
got
hold
up
i
am
unarmed
this
is
your
third
try
and
i
want
to
know
what
s
back
of
the
talk
cried
the
moving
closer
till
the
light
shone
on
his
features
which
commenced
to
twitch
he
raised
the
revolver
he
had
half
lowered
there
s
reason
enough
and
you
know
glenister
looked
him
fairly
between
the
eyes
gripping
himself
with
firm
hands
to
stop
the
tremor
he
felt
in
his
bones
you
can
t
kill
me
he
said
i
am
too
good
a
man
to
murder
you
might
shoot
a
crook
but
you
can
t
kill
a
brave
man
when
he
s
unarmed
you
re
no
he
remained
rigid
in
his
chair
however
moving
nothing
but
his
lips
meeting
the
other
s
look
unflinchingly
the
kid
hesitated
an
instant
while
his
eyes
which
had
been
fixed
with
the
glare
of
hatred
wavered
a
moment
betraying
the
faintest
sign
of
indecision
glenister
cried
out
exultantly
ha
i
knew
it
your
neck

the
gambler
grimaced
i
can
t
do
it
if
i
could

turned
but
you

up
and
roy
refused
i
gave
cherry
my
yes
and
more
too
the
man
gritted
i
saw
it
even
yet
glenister
had
made
no
slightest
move
realizing
that
a
feather
s
weight
might
snap
the
gambler
s
nervous
tension
and
bring
the
involuntary
twitch
that
would
put
him
out
swifter
than
a
whip
is
cracked
i
have
tried
it
before
but
murder
isn
t

kid

eye
caught
the
glint
of

she
had
discarded

he
backed
out
of
the
room
into
the
of
the
kitchen
watching
with
lynxlike
closeness
the
man
who
sat
so
quietly
under
the
shaded
light
he
felt
behind
him
for
the
outer
and
turned
it
to
let
in
a
white
sheet
of
rain
then
vanished
like
a
storm
wraith
leaving
a
man
and
a
zigzag
trail
of
water
which
gleamed
in
the
lamplight
like
a
pool
of
blood
chapter
xviii
wherein
a
trap
is
baited
glenister
did
not
wait
long
after
his
visitor
s
departure
but
extinguished
the
light
locked
the
door
and
began
the
further
adventures
of
this
night
the
storm
welcomed
him
with
suffocating
violence
sucking
the
very
breath
from
his
lips
while
the
rain
beat
through
till
his
flesh
was
cold
and
aching
he
thought
with
a
pang
of
the
girl
facing
this
tempest
going
out
to
meet
the
thousand
perils
of
the
night
and
it
remained
for
him
to
bear
his
part
as
she
bore
hers
smilingly
the
last
hour
had
added
another
and
mysterious
danger
to
his
full
measure
could
the
kid
be
jealous
of
cherry
surely
not
then
what
else
the
tornado
had
driven
his
trailers
to
cover
evidently
for
the
streets
were
given
over
to
its
violence
and
roy
encountered
no
hostile
sign
as
he
was
buffeted
from
house
to
house
he
adventured
cautiously
and
yet
with
haste
finding
certain
homes
where
the
marshals
had
been
before
him
peopled
now
only
by
frightened
wives
and
children
a
scattered
few
of
the
vigilantes
had
been
taken
thus
while
the
warring
elements
had
prevented
their
families
from
spreading
the
alarm
or
venturing
out
for
succor
those
whom
he
was
able
to
warn
dressed
hurriedly
took
their
rifles
and
went
out
into
the
drifting
night
leaving
empty
cabins
and
weeping
women
the
great
fight
was
on
towards
daylight
the
remnants
of
the
vigilantes
straggled
into
the
big
blank
warehouse
on
the
and
there
beneath
the
smoking
glare
of
lanterns
cursed
the
name
of
mcnamara
as
dawn
grayed
the
ragged
eastern
dextry
and
slapjack
blew
in
through
the
spindrift
bringing
word
from
cherry
and
lifting
a
load
from
glenister
s
mind
there
s
a
game
girl
said
the
old
miner
as
he
wrung
out
his
clothes
she
was
half
gone
when
she
got
to
us
and
now
she
s
waiting
for
the
storm
to
break
so
that
she
can
come
it
s
clearing
up
to
the
east
slapjack
chattered
d
you
know
i
m
gettin
so
rheumatic
that
don
t
feel
comfortable
to
me
no
uriatic
acid
in
the
blood
said
dextry
what
s
our
next
move
he
asked
of
his
partner
when
do
we
hang
this
politician
seems
like
we
ve
got
enough
here
to
tie
a
can
onto
the
whole
outfit
push
the
town
site
of
nome
off
the
map
and
start
i
think
we
had
better
lie
low
and
watch
developments
the
other
cautioned
there
s
no
telling
what
may
turn
up
during
the
that
s
right
stranglers
is
like
spirits
they
work
best
in
the
as
the
day
grew
the
storm
died
leaving
ramparts
of
clouds
hanging
sullenly
above
the
ocean
s
rim
while
those
skilled
in
weather
prophecy
foretold
the
coming
of
the
equinoctial
in
mcnamara
s
office
there
was
great
stir
and
the
coming
of
many
men
the
boss
sat
in
his
chair
smoking
countless
cigars
his
big
face
set
in
grim
lines
his
hard
eyes
peering
through
the
pall
of
blue
at
those
he
questioned
he
worked
the
wires
of
his
machine
until
his
dolls
doubled
and
danced
and
twisted
at
his
touch
after
a
gusty
interview
he
had
dismissed
voorhees
with
a
merciless
raging
bitterly
at
the
man
s
failure
you
re
not
fit
to
herd
sheep
thirty
men
out
all
night
and
what
do
you
get
a
dozen
miners
you
bag
the
and
the
big
game
runs
to
cover
i
wanted
glenister
but
you
let
him
slip
through
your
fingers
now
it
s
war
what
a
mess
you
ve
made
if
i
had
even
helper
with
a
brain
the
size
of
a
flaxseed
this
game
would
be
a
gift
but
you
ve
bungled
every
move
from
the
start
bah
put
a
spy
in
the
with
those
prisoners
and
make
them
talk
offer
them
anything
for
information
now
get
out
he
called
for
a
certain
deputy
and
questioned
him
regarding
the
night
s
quest
remarking
finally
there
s
treachery
somewhere
those
men
were
nobody
came
near
glenister
s
house
except
miss
chester
the
man
replied
what
the
judge
s
niece
we
caught
her
by
mistake
in
the
later
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
with
voorhees
at
the
northern
asked
to
see
the
receiver
and
told
him
the
chief
won
t
believe
that
i
saw
miss
chester
in
the
last
night
but
she
was
there
with
glenister
she
must
have
put
him
wise
to
our
game
or
he
wouldn
t
have
known
we
were
after
his
hearer
made
no
comment
but
when
alone
rose
and
paced
the
floor
with
heavy
tread
while
his
face
grew
savage
and
brutal
so
that
s
the
game
eh
it
s
man
to
man
from
now
on
very
well
glenister
i
ll
have
your
life
for
that
and
then
you
ll
pay
miss
he
considered
carefully
a
plot
for
a
plot
if
he
could
not
swap
intrigue
with
these
miners
and
beat
them
badly
he
deserved
to
lose
now
that
the
girl
gave
herself
to
their
cause
he
would
use
her
again
and
see
how
well
she
answered
public
opinion
would
not
stand
too
great
a
strain
and
although
he
had
acted
within
his
rights
last
night
he
dared
not
go
much
further
diplomacy
therefore
must
serve
he
must
force
his
enemies
beyond
the
law
and
into
his
trap
she
had
passed
the
word
once
she
would
do
so
again
he
hurried
to
stillman
s
house
and
stormed
into
the
presence
of
the
judge
he
told
the
story
so
artfully
that
the
judge
s
astonished
unbelief
yielded
to
rage
and
cowardice
and
he
sent
for
his
niece
she
came
down
white
and
silent
having
heard
the
loud
voices
the
old
man
berated
her
with
shrewish
fury
while
mcnamara
stood
silent
the
girl
listened
with
entire
until
her
uncle
made
a
reference
to
glenister
that
she
found
intolerable
hush
i
will
not
listen
she
cried
passionately
i
warned
him
because
you
would
have
sacrificed
him
after
he
had
saved
our
lives
that
is
all
he
is
an
honest
man
and
i
am
grateful
to
him
that
is
the
only
foundation
for
your
mcnamara
with
apparent
candor
broke
in
you
thought
you
were
doing
right
of
course
but
your
action
will
have
terrible
consequences
now
we
ll
have
riot
bloodshed
and
heaven
knows
what
it
was
to
save
all
this
that
i
wanted
to
break
up
their
organization
a
week
s
imprisonment
would
have
done
it
but
now
they
re
armed
and
belligerent
and
we
ll
have
a
battle
no
no
she
cried
there
mustn
t
be
any
there
is
no
use
trying
to
check
them
they
are
rushing
to
their
own
destruction
i
have
learned
that
they
plan
to
attack
the
midas
and
i
ll
have
fifty
soldiers
waiting
for
them
there
it
is
a
shame
for
they
are
decent
fellows
blinded
by
ignorance
and
misled
by
that
young
miner
this
will
be
the
blackest
night
the
north
has
ever
with
this
mcnamara
left
the
house
and
went
in
search
of
voorhees
remarking
to
himself
now
miss
helen
send
your
warning
the
sooner
the
better
if
i
know
those
vigilantes
it
will
set
them
crazy
and
yet
not
crazy
enough
to
attack
the
midas
they
will
strike
for
me
and
when
they
hit
my
poor
unguarded
office
they
ll
think
hell
has
moved
mr
marshal
said
he
to
his
tool
i
want
you
to
gather
forty
men
quietly
and
to
arm
them
with
winchesters
they
must
be
fellows
who
won
t
faint
at
blood
you
know
the
kind
assemble
them
at
my
office
after
dark
one
at
a
time
by
the
back
way
it
must
be
done
with
absolute
secrecy
now
see
if
you
can
do
this
one
thing
and
not
get
balled
up
if
you
fail
i
ll
make
you
answer
to
why
don
t
you
get
the
troops
ventured
voorhees
if
there
s
one
thing
i
want
to
avoid
it
s
soldiers
either
here
or
at
the
mines
when
they
step
in
we
step
out
and
i
m
not
ready
for
that
just
the
receiver
smiled
sinisterly
helen
meanwhile
had
fled
to
her
room
and
there
received
glenister
s
note
through
cherry
malotte
s
messenger
it
rekindled
her
worst
fears
and
bore
out
mcnamara
s
prophecy
the
more
she
read
of
it
the
more
certain
she
grew
that
the
crisis
was
only
a
question
of
hours
and
that
with
darkness
tragedy
would
walk
the
streets
of
nome
the
thought
of
the
wrong
already
done
was
lost
in
the
lonely
girl
s
terror
of
the
crime
about
to
happen
for
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
been
the
instrument
to
set
these
forces
in
motion
that
she
had
loosed
this
avalanche
of
greed
hatred
and
brutality
and
when
the
crash
should
come
the
girl
shuddered
it
must
not
be
she
would
shriek
a
warning
from
the
even
at
cost
of
her
uncle
of
mcnamara
and
of
herself
and
yet
she
had
no
proof
that
a
crime
existed
although
it
all
lay
clear
in
her
own
mind
the
certainty
of
it
arose
only
from
her
intuition
if
only
she
were
able
to
take
a
hand
if
only
she
were
not
a
woman
then
cherry
malotte
s
words
anent
struve
recurred
to
her
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
woman
s
they
brought
back
the
lawyer
s
assurance
that
those
documents
she
had
safeguarded
all
through
the
long
journey
really
contained
the
proof
if
they
did
then
they
held
the
power
to
check
this
impending
conflict
her
uncle
and
the
boss
would
not
dare
continue
if
threatened
with
exposure
and
prosecution
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
urgent
seemed
the
necessity
to
prevent
the
battle
of
there
was
a
chance
here
at
least
and
the
only
one
adding
to
her
mental
torment
was
the
constant
vision
of
that
face
in
the
curtains
at
the
northern
it
was
her
brother
yet
what
mystery
shrouded
this
affair
also
what
kept
him
from
her
what
caused
him
to
slink
away
like
a
thief
discovered
she
grew
dizzy
and
hysterical
struve
turned
in
his
chair
as
the
door
to
his
private
office
opened
then
leaped
to
his
feet
at
sight
of
the
girl
standing
there
i
came
for
the
papers
she
said
i
knew
you
the
blood
went
out
of
his
cheeks
then
surged
back
up
to
his
eyes
it
s
a
bargain
then
she
nodded
give
them
to
me
he
laughed
unpleasantly
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
ll
keep
my
part
of
the
bargain
if
you
ll
keep
yours
but
this
is
no
place
nor
time
there
s
riot
in
the
air
and
i
m
busy
preparing
for
come
back
when
it
s
all
but
it
was
the
terror
of
s
doings
that
led
her
into
his
power
i
ll
never
come
back
she
said
it
is
my
whim
to
know
yes
at
he
meditated
for
a
time
then
it
shall
be
i
ll
shirk
the
fight
i
ll
sacrifice
what
shreds
of
duty
have
clung
to
me
because
the
fever
for
you
is
in
my
bones
and
it
seems
to
me
i
d
do
murder
for
it
that
s
the
kind
of
a
man
i
am
and
i
have
no
pride
in
myself
because
of
it
but
i
ve
always
been
that
way
we
ll
ride
to
the
sign
of
the
sled
it
s
a
romantic
little
ten
miles
from
here
perched
high
above
the
snake
river
trail
we
ll
take
dinner
there
but
the
papers
i
ll
have
them
with
me
we
ll
start
in
an
in
an
hour
she
echoed
lifelessly
and
left
him
he
chuckled
grimly
and
seized
the
telephone
central
call
the
sled
seven
rings
on
the
snake
river
branch
hello
that
you
shortz
this
is
struve
anybody
at
the
house
good
turn
them
away
if
they
come
and
say
that
you
re
closed
none
of
your
business
i
ll
be
out
about
dark
so
have
dinner
for
two
spread
yourself
and
keep
the
place
clear
strengthened
by
glenister
s
note
helen
went
straight
to
the
other
woman
and
this
time
was
not
kept
waiting
nor
greeted
with
sneers
but
found
cherry
cloaked
in
a
shy
dignity
which
she
clasped
tightly
about
herself
under
her
visitor
s
incoherence
she
lost
her
diffidence
however
and
when
helen
had
finished
remarked
with
decision
don
t
go
with
him
he
s
a
bad
but
i
the
blood
of
those
men
will
be
on
me
if
i
don
t
stop
this
tragedy
if
those
papers
tell
the
tale
i
think
they
do
i
can
call
off
my
uncle
and
make
mcnamara
give
back
the
mines
you
said
struve
told
you
the
whole
scheme
did
you
see
the
no
i
have
only
his
word
but
he
spoke
of
those
documents
repeatedly
saying
they
contained
his
instructions
to
tie
up
the
mines
in
order
to
give
a
for
the
lawsuits
he
bragged
that
the
rest
of
the
gang
were
in
his
power
and
that
he
could
land
them
in
the
penitentiary
for
conspiracy
that
s
it
s
the
only
chance
said
helen
they
are
sending
soldiers
to
the
midas
to
lie
in
ambush
and
you
must
warn
the
cherry
paled
at
this
and
ejaculated
good
lord
roy
said
he
d
lead
an
attack
the
two
stared
at
each
other
if
i
succeed
with
struve
i
can
stop
it
all
all
of
this
injustice
and
crime
do
you
realize
what
you
re
risking
cherry
demanded
that
man
is
an
animal
you
ll
have
to
kill
him
to
save
yourself
and
he
ll
never
give
up
those
yes
he
will
said
helen
fiercely
and
i
defy
him
to
harm
me
the
sign
of
the
sled
is
a
public
with
a
landlord
a
telephone
and
other
guests
will
you
warn
glenister
about
the
troops
i
will
and
bless
you
for
a
brave
girl
wait
a
cherry
took
from
the
dresser
her
tiny
revolver
don
t
hesitate
to
use
this
i
want
you
to
know
also
that
i
m
sorry
for
what
i
said
as
she
hurried
away
helen
realized
with
a
shock
the
change
that
the
past
few
months
had
wrought
in
her
in
truth
it
was
as
glenister
had
said
his
northland
worked
strangely
with
its
denizens
what
of
that
shrinking
girl
who
had
stepped
out
of
the
sheltered
life
strong
only
in
her
untried
honesty
to
become
a
hunted
harried
thing
juggling
with
honor
and
reputation
in
her
heart
a
fear
that
she
might
kill
a
man
this
night
to
gain
her
end
the
elements
were
moulding
her
with
irresistible
hands
roy
s
contact
with
the
primitive
had
not
roughened
him
more
quickly
than
had
hers
she
met
her
appointment
with
struve
and
they
rode
away
together
he
talkative
and
elated
she
silent
and
icy
late
in
the
afternoon
the
cloud
banks
to
the
eastward
assumed
alarming
proportions
they
brought
with
them
an
early
nightfall
and
when
they
broke
let
forth
a
tempest
which
rivalled
that
of
the
previous
night
during
the
first
of
it
armed
men
came
sifting
into
mcnamara
s
office
from
the
rear
and
were
hidden
throughout
the
building
whenever
he
descried
a
peculiarly
desperate
ruffian
the
boss
called
him
aside
for
private
instruction
and
gave
minute
description
of
a
erect
youth
in
white
hat
and
gradually
he
set
his
trap
with
the
men
voorhees
had
raked
from
the
slums
and
when
it
was
done
smiled
to
himself
as
he
thought
it
over
he
ceased
to
regret
the
miscarriage
of
last
night
s
plan
for
it
had
served
to
goad
his
enemies
to
the
point
he
desired
to
the
point
where
they
would
rush
to
their
own
undoing
he
thought
with
satisfaction
of
the
rôle
he
would
play
in
the
united
states
press
when
the
sensational
news
of
this
night
s
adventure
came
out
a
court
official
who
dared
to
do
his
duty
despite
a
lawless
mob
a
receiver
who
turned
a
midnight
attack
into
a
rout
and
shambles
that
is
what
they
would
say
what
if
he
did
exceed
his
authority
thereafter
what
if
there
were
a
scandal
who
would
question
as
to
soldiers
no
decidedly
no
he
wished
no
help
of
soldiers
at
this
time
the
sight
of
a
ship
in
the
offing
towards
dark
caused
him
some
uneasiness
for
notwithstanding
the
assurance
that
the
course
of
justice
in
the
san
francisco
courts
had
been
clogged
he
knew
bill
wheaton
to
be
a
resourceful
lawyer
and
a
determined
man
therefore
it
relieved
him
to
note
the
rising
gale
which
precluded
the
possibility
of
interference
from
that
source
let
them
come
if
they
would
by
that
time
some
of
the
mines
would
be
ownerless
and
his
position
strengthened
a
hundredfold
he
telephoned
the
mines
to
throw
out
guards
although
he
reasoned
that
none
but
madmen
would
think
of
striking
there
in
the
face
of
the
warning
which
he
knew
must
have
been
transmitted
through
helen
putting

sought

bring
your
niece
over
to
my
place
there

trouble
in

and
i

prepared
for
she
hasn

returned
from
her
ride
yet
i
m
afraid
she
s
caught
in
the
the
judge
gazed
anxiously
into
the
darkness
during
all
the
long
day
the
vigilantes
lay
in
hiding
impatient
at
their
idleness
and
wondering
at
the
lack
of
effort
made
towards
their
discovery
not
dreaming
that
mcnamara
had
more
cleverly
hidden
plans
behind
when
cherry
s
note
of
warning
came
they
gathered
in
the
back
room
and
gave
voice
to
their
opinions
there
s
only
one
way
to
clear
the
atmosphere
said
the
chairman
you
bet
chorussed
the
others
they
ve
garrisoned
the
mines
so
let
s
go
through
the
town
and
make
a
clean
job
of
it
let
s
hang
the
whole
outfit
to
one
this
met
with
general
approval
glenister
alone
demurring
said
he
i
have
reasoned
it
out
differently
and
i
want
you
to
hear
me
through
before
deciding
last
night
i
got
word
from
wheaton
that
the
california
courts
are
against
us
he
attributes
it
to
influence
but
whatever
the
reason
we
are
cut
off
from
all
legal
help
either
in
this
court
or
on
appeal
now
suppose
we
lynch
these
officials
what
do
we
gain
martial
law
in
two
hours
our
mines
tied
up
for
another
year
and
who
knows
what
else
maybe
a
corrupter
court
next
season
suppose
on
the
other
hand
we
fail
and
somehow
i
feel
that
we
will
for
that
boss
is
no
fool
what
then
those
of
us
who
don
t
find
the
morgue
will
end
in
jail
you
say
we
can
t
meet
the
soldiers
i
say
we
can
and
must
we
must
carry
this
row
to
them
we
must
jump
it
past
the
courts
of
alaska
past
the
courts
of
california
and
up
to
the
white
house
where
there
s
one
honest
man
at
least
we
must
do
something
to
wake
up
the
men
in
washington
we
must
get
out
of
politics
for
mcnamara
can
beat
us
there
although
he
s
a
strong
man
he
can
t
corrupt
the
president
we
have
one
shot
left
and
it
must
reach
the
potomac
when
uncle
sam
takes
a
hand
we
ll
get
a
square
deal
so
i
say
let
us
strike
at
the
midas
and
take
her
if
we
can
some
of
us
will
go
down
but
what
of
it
following
this
harangue
he
outlined
a
plan
which
in
its
unique
daring
took
away
their
breaths
and
as
he
filled
in
detail
after
detail
they
brightened
with
excitement
and
that
love
of
the
long
chance
which
makes
gamblers
of
those
who
thread
the
silent
valleys
or
tread
the
edge
of
things
his
boldness
stirred
them
and
enthusiasm
did
the
rest
all
i
want
for
myself
he
said
is
the
chance
to
run
the
big
risk
it

by
dextry
spoke
breathlessly
to
slapjack
in
the
pause
which
ensued
ain
t
he
a
heller
we
ll
go

the
miners
chimed
to
a
man
and
the
chairman
added
let
s
have
glenister
lead
this
forlorn
hope
i
am
willing
to
stand
or
fall
on
his
they
acquiesced
without
a
dissenting
voice
and
with
the
firm
hands
of
a
natural
leader
the
young
man
took
control
let
s
hurry
up
said

it
s
a
long
mush
and
the
mud

he
answered
at
which
dextry
grinned
delightedly
at
his
companion
and
slapjack
showed
his
toothless
gums
in
answer
saying
he
sure
a
few
more
words
and
glenister
accompanied
by
these
two
slipped
out
into
the
whirling
storm
and
a
later
the
rest
followed
one
by
one
the
vigilantes
left
the
blackness
blotting
them
up
an
arm
from
the
door
till
at
last
the
big
bleak
warehouse
echoed
hollowly
to
the
voice
of
the
wind
and
water
over
in
the
eastern
end
of
town
behind
dark
windows
upon
which
the
sheeted
rain
beat
furiously
other
armed
men
lay
patiently
waiting
waiting
some
word
from
the
bulky
shadow
which
stood
with
folded
arms
close
against
a
square
of
gray
while
over
their
heads
a
wretched
old
man
paced
back
and
forth
wringing
his
hands
pausing
at
every
turn
to
peer
out
into
the
night
and
to
mumble
the
name
of
his
sister
s
child
chapter
xix
dynamite
early
in
the
evening
cherry
malotte
opened
her
door
to
find
the
bronco
kid
on
her
step
he
entered
and
threw
off
his
rubber
coat
knowing
him
well
she
waited
for
his
disclosure
of
his
errand
his
sallow
skin
was
without
trace
of
color
his
eyes
were
strangely
tired
deep
lines
had
gathered
about
his
lips
while
his
hands
kept
up
constant
little
nervous
explorations
as
though
for
days
and
nights
he
had
not
slept
and
now
hovered
on
the
verge
of
some
hysteria
he
gave
her
the
impression
of
a
smouldering
mine
with
the
fire
eating
close
up
to
the
powder
she
judged
that
his
body
had
been
racked
by
every
passion
till
now
it
hung
jaded
and
weary
yielding
only
to
the
spur
of
his
restless
revengeful
spirit
after
a
few
objectless
remarks
he
began
abruptly
do
you
love
roy
glenister
his
voice
like
his
manner
was
jealously
eager
and
he
watched
her
carefully
as
she
replied
without
quibble
or
deceit
yes
kid
and
i
always
shall
he
is
the
only
true
man
i
have
ever
known
and
i
m
not
ashamed
of
my
for
a
long
time
he
studied
her
and
then
broke
into
rapid
speech
allowing
her
no
time
for
interruption
i
ve
held
back
and
held
back
because
i
m
no
talker
i
can
t
be
in
my
business
but
this
is
my
last
chance
and
i
want
to
put
myself
right
with
you
i
ve
loved
you
ever
since
the
dawson
days
not
in
the
way
you
d
expect
from
a
man
of
my
sort
perhaps
but
with
the
kind
of
love
that
a
woman
wants
i
never
showed
my
hand
for
what
was
the
use
that
man
outheld
me
i
d
have
quit
faro
years
back
only
i
wouldn
t
leave
this
country
as
long
as
you
were
a
part
of
it
and
up
here
i
m
only
a
gambler
fit
for
nothing
else
i
d
made
up
my
mind
to
let
you
have
him
till
something
happened
a
couple
of
months
ago
but
now
it
can
t
go
through
i
ll
have
to
down
him
it
isn
t
concerning
you
i
m
not
a
welcher
no
it
s
a
thing
i
can
t
talk
about
a
thing
that
s
made
me
into
a
wolf
made
me
skulk
and
walk
the
alleys
like
a
dago
it
s
put
murder
into
my
heart
i
ve
tried
to
assassinate
him
i
tried
it
here
last
night
but
i
was
a
gentleman
once
till
the
cards
came
he
knows
the
answer
now
though
and
he
s
ready
for
me
so
one
of
us
will
go
out
like
a
candle
when
we
meet
i
felt
that
i
had
to
tell
you
before
i
cut
him
down
or
before
he
got
you
re
talking
like
a
madman
kid
she
replied
and
you
mustn
t
turn
against
him
now
he
has
troubles
enough
i
never
knew
you
cared
for
me
what
a
tangle
it
is
to
be
sure
you
love
me
i
love
him
he
loves
that
girl
and
she
loves
a
crook
isn
t
that
tragedy
enough
without
your
adding
to
it
you
come
at
a
bad
time
too
for
i
m
half
insane
there
s
something
dreadful
in
the
air
i
ll
have
to
kill
him
the
man
muttered
doggedly
and
plead
or
reason
as
she
would
she
could
get
nothing
from
him
except
those
words
till
at
last
she
turned
upon
him
fiercely
you
say
you
love
me
very
well
let
s
see
if
you
do
i
know
the
kind
of
a
man
you
are
and
i
know
what
this
feud
will
mean
to
him
coming
just
at
this
time
put
it
aside
and
i
ll
marry
the
gambler
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
you
do
love
him
don
t
you
she
bowed
her
face
and
he
winced
but
continued
i
wouldn
t
make
you
my
wife
that
way
i
didn
t
mean
it
that
at
this
she
laughed
bitterly
oh
i
see
of
course
not
how
foolish
of
me
to
expect
it
of
a
man
like
you
i
understand
what
you
mean
now
and
the
bargain
will
stand
just
the
same
if
that
is
what
you
came
for
i
wanted
to
leave
this
life
and
be
good
to
go
away
and
start
over
and
play
the
game
square
but
i
see
it
s
no
use
i
ll
pay
i
know
how
relentless
you
are
and
the
price
is
low
enough
you
can
have
me
and
that
marriage
talk
i
ll
not
speak
of
again
i
ll
stay
what
i
am
for
his
stop
cried
the
kid
you
re
wrong
i
m
not
that
kind
of
a
his
voice
broke
suddenly
its
vehemence
shaking
his
slim
body
oh
cherry
i
love
you
the
way
a
man
ought
to
love
a
woman
it
s
one
of
the
two
good
things
left
in
me
and
i
want
to
take
you
away
from
here
where
we
can
both
hide
from
the
past
where
we
can
start
new
as
you
you
would
marry
me
she
asked
in
an
hour
and
give
my
heart
s
blood
for
the
privilege
but
i
can
t
stop
this
thing
not
even
if
your
own
dear
life
hung
upon
it
i
kill
that
she
approached
him
and
laid
her
arms
about
his
neck
every
line
of
her
body
pleading
but
he
refused
steadfastly
while
the
sweat
stood
out
upon
his
brow
she
begged
they
re
all
against
him
kid
he
s
fighting
a
hopeless
fight
he
laid
all
he
had
at
that
girl
s
feet
and
i
ll
do
the
same
for
the
man
growled
savagely
he
got
his
reward
he
took
all
she
had
don
t
be
a
fool
i
guess
i
know
you
re
a
but
you
haven
t
any
right
to
talk
like
that
about
a
good
woman
even
to
a
bad
one
like
into
his
dark
eyes
slowly
crept
a
hungry
look
and
she
felt
him
begin
to
tremble
the
least
bit
he
undertook
to
speak
paused
wet
his
lips
then
carefully
chose
these
words
do
you
mean
that
he
did
not
that
she
is
a
good
girl
he
sat
down
weakly
and
passed
a
shaking
hand
over
his
face
which
had
begun
to
twitch
and
jerk
again
as
it
had
on
that
night
when
his
vengeance
was
thwarted
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
know
she
s
more
than
that
she
s
honest
and
i
don
t
know
why
i
m
saying
this
but
it
was
on
my
mind
and
i
was
half
distracted
when
you
came
she
s
in
danger
though
at
this
minute
i
don
t
dare
to
think
of
what
may
have
happened
for
she
s
risked
everything
to
make
reparation
to
roy
and
his
what
she
s
gone
to
the
sign
of
the
sled
alone
with
struve
shouted
the
gambler
leaping
to
his
feet
alone
with
struve
on
a
night
like
this
he
shook
her
fiercely
crying
what
for
tell
me
quick
she
recounted
the
reasons
for
helen
s
adventure
while
the
man
s
face
became
terrible
oh
kid
i
am
to
blame
for
letting
her
go
why
did
i
do
it
i
m
afraid
the
sign
of
the
sled
belongs
to
struve
and
the
fellow
who
runs
it
is
a
the
bronco
looked
at
the
clock
his
eyes
bloodshot
and
dull
like
those
of
a
goaded
bull
it
s
eight
o
clock
now
ten
miles
two
hours
too
late
what
ails
you
she
questioned
baffled
by
his
strange
demeanor
you
called
the
one
woman
just
now
and
yet
he
swung
towards
her
heavily
she
s
my
your
sister
oh
i
i
m
glad
i
m
glad
but
don
t
stand
there
like
a
wooden
man
for
you
ve
work
to
do
wake
up
can
t
you
hear
she
s
in
peril
her
words
whipped
him
out
of
his
stupor
so
that
he
drew
himself
somewhat
under
control
get
into
your
coat
hurry
hurry
my
pony
will
take
you
she
snatched
his
garment
from
the
chair
and
held
it
for
him
while
the
life
ran
back
into
his
veins
together
they
dashed
out
into
the
storm
as
she
and
roy
had
done
and
as
he
flung
the
saddle
on
the
buckskin
she
said
i
understand
it
all
now
you
heard
the
talk
about
her
and
glenister
but
it
s
wrong
i
lied
and
schemed
and
intrigued
against
her
but
it
s
over
now
i
guess
there
s
a
little
streak
of
good
in
me
somewhere
after
he
spoke
to
her
from
the
saddle
it
s
more
than
a
streak
cherry
and
you
re
my
kind
of
she
smiled
wanly
back
at
him
under
the
that
s
kid
i
don
t
want
to
be
your
kind
i
want
to
be
his
kind
or
your
sister
s
upon
leaving
the
rendezvous
glenister
and
his
two
friends
slunk
through
the
night
avoiding
the
life
and
lights
of
the
town
while
the
wind
surged
out
of
the
voids
to
seaward
driving
its
wet
burden
through
their
flapping
slickers
pelting
their
faces
as
though
enraged
at
its
failure
to
wash
away
the
purposes
written
there
their
course
brought
them
to
a
cabin
at
the
western
outskirts
of
the
city
where
they
paused
long
enough
to
adjust
something
beneath
the
brims
of
their
hats
past
them
ran
the
iron
rails
of
the
road
which
led
out
across
the
quaking
tundra
to
the
mountains
and
the
mines
upon
this
slender
trail
of
steel
there
rolled
one
small
ungainly
teapot
of
an
engine
which
daily
creaked
and
clanked
back
and
forth
at
a
snail
s
pace
screaming
and
wailing
its
complaint
of
the
two
behind
the
ties
beneath
it
were
spiked
to
planks
laid
lengthwise
over
the
in
places
sagging
beneath
the
surface
till
the
humpbacked
locomotive
yawed
and
reeled
and
squealed
like
a
drunken
at
night
it
panted
wearily
into
the
board
station
and
there
sighed
and
coughed
and
hissed
away
its
fatigue
as
the
coals
died
and
the
breath
relaxed
in
its
lungs
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
was
perforce
the
motto
of
its
grimy
crew
who
lived
near
by
they
were
just
retiring
when
stayed
by
a
summons
at
their
door
the
engineer
opened
it
to
admit
what
appeared
to
his
astonished
eyes
to
be
a
krupp
cannon
propelled
by
a
man
in
clothes
and
white
cotton
mask
this
weapon
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
great
monster
which
stared
with
baleful
fixity
at
his
vitals
giving
him
a
cold
and
empty
feeling
away
back
beyond
this
cyclops
of
the
sightless
orb
were
two
other
strangers
likewise
equipped
the
fireman
arose
from
his
chair
dropping
an
empty
shoe
with
a
thump
but
being
of
the
west
without
cavil
or
waste
of
wind
he
stretched
his
hands
above
his
head
balancing
on
one
foot
to
keep
his
unshod
member
from
the
damp
floor
he
had
unbuckled
his
belt
and
now
loosened
by
the
movement
his
overalls
seemed
bent
on
sinking
floorward
in
an
ecstasy
of
abashment
at
the
intrusion
whereupon
with
convulsive
grip
he
hugged
them
to
their
duty
one
hand
and
foot
still
elevated
as
though
in
the
grand
of
some
secret
order
the
other
man
was
new
to
the
ways
of
the
north
so
backed
to
the
limit
of
his
quarters
laid
both
hands
protectingly
upon
his
middle
and
doubled
up
remarking
fervidly
don
t
point
that
damn
thing
at
my
ha
ha
laughed
the
fireman
with
unnatural
loudness
have
your

said
the
foremost
figure
its
breath
bellying
out
the
mask
at
its
mouth
sure
it
is
insisted
the
shoeless
one
must
be
we

into

and
come
along
we
won

the
two
obeyed
and
were
taken
to
the
sleeping
engine
and
there
instructed
to
produce
a
full
head
of
steam
in
thirty
minutes
or
suffer
a
premature
taking
off
and
a
prompt
elision
from
the
realms
of
applied
mechanics
as
stimulus
to
their
efforts
two
of
the
men
stood
over
them
till
the
engine
began
to
sob
and
sigh
reluctantly
through
the
gloom
that
curtained
the
cab
they
saw
other
dim
forms
materializing
and
climbing
silently
on
to
the
cars
behind
then
as
the
touched
the
mark
the
word
was
given
and
the
train
rumbled
out
from
its
shelter
its
shrill
plaint
at
curb
and
crossing
whipped
away
and
drowned
in
the
storm
slapjack
remained
in
the
cab
gun
in
lap
while
dextry
climbed
back
to
glenister
he
found
the
young
man
in
good
spirits
despite
the
discomfort
of
his
exposed
position
and
striving
to
light
his
pipe
behind
the
shelter
of
his
coat
is
the
dynamite
aboard
the
old
man
questioned
sure
enough
to
ballast
a
as
the
train
crept
out
of
the
camp
and
across
the
river
bridge
its
only
light
or
glimmer
the
sparks
that
were
snatched
and
harried
by
the
blast
the
partners
seated
themselves
on
the
powder
cases
and
conversed
guardedly
while
about
them
sounded
the
low
murmur
of
the
men
who
risked
their
all
upon
this
cry
to
duty
who
staked
their
lives
and
futures
upon
this
hazard
of
the
hills
because
they
thought
it
right
we
ve
made
a
good
fight
whether
we
win
or
lose
said
dextry
roy
replied
fight
is
made
and
what
does
that
mean
my
hardest
battle
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
midas
or
the
mines
of
anvil
i
fought
and
conquered
awful
wet
night
for
philosophy
the
first
remarked
it
s
apt
to
sour
on
you
like
milk
in
a
s
pose
you
put
overalls
an
gum
boots
on
some
of
them
boston
ideas
an
lead
em
out
where
i
can
look
em
over
an
find
out
what
they
re
up
i
mean
that
i
was
a
savage
till
i
met
helen
chester
and
she
made
a
man
of
me
it
took
sixty
days
but
i
think
she
did
a
good
job
i
love
the
wild
things
just
as
much
as
ever
but
i
ve
learned
that
there
are
duties
a
fellow
owes
to
himself
and
to
other
people
if
he
ll
only
stop
and
think
them
out
i
ve
found
out
too
that
the
right
thing
is
usually
the
hardest
to
do
oh
i
ve
improved
a
gee
but
you
re
popular
with
yourself
i
don
t
see
as
it
helps
your
looks
any
you
re
as
homely
as
ever
an
what
good
does
it
do
you
after
all
she
ll
marry
that
big
i
know
that
s
what
rankles
for
he
s
no
more
worthy
of
her
than
i
am
she
ll
do
what
s
right
however
you
may
depend
upon
that
and
perhaps
she
ll
change
him
the
way
she
did
me
why
she
worked
a
miracle
in
my
attitude
towards
life
my
manner
oh
your
manners
are
good
enough
as
they
lay
interrupted
the
other
you
never
did
eat
with
your
i
don
t
believe
in
glenister
laughed
no
when
it
comes
to
intimacies
with
decorum
you
re
right
on
the
job
along
with
any
of
them
easterners
i
watched
you
close
at
them
frisco
hotels
last
winter
and
say
you
know
as
much
as
a
horse
why
you
was
wise
to
them
tablewares
and
equal
to
a
and
it
give
me
confidence
just
to
be
with
you
i
remember
putting
milk
and
sugar
in
my
consommé
the
first
time
it
was
pale
and
in
a
cup
and
looked
like
tea
but
not
you
no
sir
you
savvied
plenty
and
squeezed
a
lemon
into
yours
to
clean
your
fingers
i
roy
slapped
his
partner
s
wet
back
for
he
was
buoyant
and
elated
the
sense
of
nearing
danger
pulsed
through
him
like
wine
that
wasn
t
just
what
i
meant
but
it
goes
say
if
we
win
back
our
mine
we
ll
hit
for
new
york
next
eh
no
i
don
t
aim
to
mingle
with
no
higher
civilization
than
i
got
in
frisco
i
use
that
word
higher
like
it
was
applied
to
meat
not
that
i
wouldn
t
seem
apropos
i
m
stylish
enough
for
fifth
avenue
or
anywheres
but
i
like
the
west
speakin
of
modes
an
styles
when
i
get
all
lit
up
in
that
gray
woosted
suit
of
mine
i
guess
i
make
the
jaded
set
up
an
take
notice
eh
somethin
doin
every
minute
in
the
cranin
of
necks
what
nothin
gaudy
but
the
acme
of
neatness
an
form
as
the
feller
said
who
sold
it
to
their
common
peril
brought
the
friends
together
again
into
that
close
bond
which
had
been
theirs
without
interruption
until
this
recent
change
in
the
younger
had
led
him
to
choose
paths
at
variance
with
the
old
man
s
ideas
and
now
they
spoke
heart
to
heart
in
the
ways
of
old
while
beneath
each
whimsical
irony
was
that
mutual
love
and
understanding
which
had
consecrated
their
partnership
arriving
at
the
end
of
the
road
the
vigilantes
debouched
and
went
into
the
darkness
of
the
cañon
behind
their
leader
to
whom
the
trails
were
familiar
he
bade
them
pause
finally
and
gave
his
last
instructions
they
are
on
the
alert
so
you
want
to
be
careful
divide
into
two
parties
and
close
in
from
both
sides
creeping
as
near
to
the
pickets
as
possible
without
discovery
remember
to
wait
for
the
last
blast
when
it
comes
cut
loose
and
charge
like
sioux
don
t
shoot
to
kill
at
first
for
they
re
only
soldiers
and
under
orders
but
if
they
stand
well
every
man
must
do
his
dextry
appealed
to
the
dim
figures
forming
the
circle
i
leave
it
to
you
gents
if
it
ain
t
better
for
me
to
go
inside
than
for
the
boy
i
ve
had
more
experience
with
giant
powder
an
i
m
so
blamed
used
up
an
near
gone
it
wouldn
t
hurt
if
they
did
get
me
while
he
s
right
in
his
prime
glenister
stopped
him
i
won
t
yield
the
privilege
come
now
to
your
places
they
melted
away
to
each
side
while
the
old
prospector
paused
to
wring
his
partner
s
hand
i
d
ruther
it
was
me
lad
but
if
they
get
you
god
help
em
he
stumbled
after
the
departing
shadows
leaving
roy
alone
with
his
naked
fingers
glenister
ripped
open
the
powder
cases
and
secreted
the
contents
upon
his
person
each
cartridge
held
dynamite
enough
to
devastate
a
village
and
he
loaded
them
inside
his
pockets
inside
his
shirt
and
everywhere
that
he
had
room
till
he
was
burdened
and
cased
in
an
armor
part
of
which
could
have
blown
him
from
the
face
of
the
earth
so
utterly
as
to
leave
no
trace
except
perhaps
a
pit
ripped
out
of
the
he
looked
to
his
fuses
and
saw
that
they
were
wrapped
in
oiled
paper
then
placed
them
in
his
hat
having
finished
he
set
out
walking
with
difficulty
under
the
weight
he
carried
that
his
choice
of
location
had
been
well
made
was
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
ground
beneath
his
feet
sloped
away
to
a
basin
out
of
which
bubbled
a
spring
it
furnished
the
drinking
supply
of
the
midas
and
he
knew
every
inch
of
the
crevice
it
had
worn
down
the
mountain
so
felt
his
way
cautiously
along
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
where
it
ran
out
upon
the
level
it
had
worn
a
considerable
ditch
through
the
soil
and
into
this
he
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
his
bulging
clothes
handicapped
him
so
that
his
gait
was
slow
and
awkward
while
the
rain
had
swelled
the
streamlet
till
it
trickled
over
his
calves
and
up
to
his
wrists
chilling
him
so
that
his
muscles
cramped
and
his
very
bones
cried
out
with
it
the
sharp
schist
cut
into
his
palms
till
they
were
shredded
and
bleeding
while
his
knees
found
every
jagged
bit
of
over
which
he
dragged
himself
he
could
not
see
an
arm
ahead
without
rising
and
having
removed
his
slicker
for
greater
freedom
of
movement
the
rain
beat
upon
his
back
till
he
was
soaked
and
sodden
and
felt
streamlets
cleaving
downward
between
his
ribs
now
and
again
he
squatted
upon
his
haunches
straining
his
eyes
to
either
side
the
banks
were
barely
high
enough
to
shield
him
at
last
he
came
to
a
bridge
of
planks
spanning
the
ditch
and
was
about
to
rear
himself
for
another
look
when
he
suddenly
flattened
into
the
stream
bed
half
damming
the
waters
with
his
body
it
was
for
this
he
had
so
carefully
wrapped
his
fuses
a
man
passed
over
him
so
close
above
that
he
might
have
touched
him
the
sentry
paused
a
few
paces
beyond
and
accosted
another
then
retraced
his
steps
over
the
bridge
evidently
this
was
the
so
roy
wormed
his
way
forward
till
he
saw
the
blacker
blackness
of
the
mine
buildings
then
drew
himself
dripping
out
from
the
bank
he
had
run
the
gauntlet
safely
since
evicting
the
owners
the
receiver
had
erected
substantial
houses
in
place
of
the
tents
he
had
found
on
the
mine
they
were
of
frame
and
sheathed
within
and
suited
to
withstand
a
moderate
exposure
the
partners
had
witnessed
the
operation
from
a
distance
but
knew
nothing
about
the
buildings
from
close
examination
a
thrill
of
affection
for
this
place
warmed
the
young
man
he
loved
this
old
mine
it
had
realized
the
dream
of
his
boyhood
and
had
answered
the
hope
he
had
clung
to
during
his
long
fight
against
the
northland
it
had
come
to
him
when
he
was
disheartened
bringing
cheer
and
happiness
and
had
yielded
itself
like
a
bride
now
it
seemed
a
crime
to
ravage
it
he
crept
towards
the
nearest
wall
and
listened
within
was
the
sound
of
voices
though
the
windows
were
dark
showing
that
the
inhabitants
were
on
the
alert
beneath
the
foundations
he
made
mysterious
preparations
then
sought
out
the
office
building
and
doing
likewise
he
found
that
back
of
the
seeming
repose
of
the
midas
there
was
a
strained
expectancy
although
suspense
had
lengthened
the
time
out
of
all
calculation
he
judged
he
had
been
gone
from
his
companions
at
least
an
hour
and
that
they
must
be
in
place
by
now
if
they
were
not
if
anything
failed
at
this
eleventh
hour
well
those
were
the
fortunes
of
war
in
every
enterprise
however
carefully
planned
there
comes
a
time
when
chance
must
take
its
turn
he
made
his
way
inside
the
and
fumbled
for
a
match
just
as
he
was
about
to
strike
it
he
heard
the
swish
of
oiled
clothes
passing
and
waited
for
some
time
then
igniting
his
punk
and
hiding
it
under
his
coat
he
opened
the
door
to
listen
the
wind
had
died
down
now
and
the
rain
sang
musically
upon
the
metal
roofs
he
ran
swiftly
from
house
to
house
and
when
he
had
done
at
the
apices
of
the
triangle
he
had
traced
three
glowing
coals
were
sputtering
the
final
bolt
was
launched
at
last
he
stepped
down
into
the
ditch
and
drew
his
while
to
his
tautened
senses
it
seemed
that
the
very
hills
leaned
forth
in
breathless
pause
that
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
whole
night
hushed
its
thousand
voices
he
found
his
lower
jaw
set
so
stiffly
that
the
muscles
ached
levelling
his
weapon
at
the
eaves
of
the
he
pulled
trigger
rapidly
the
bang
bang
bang
six
times
repeated
sounding
dull
and
dead
beneath
the
blanket
of
mist
that
overhung
a
shout
sounded
behind
him
and
then
the
shriek
of
a
winchester
ball
close
over
his
head
he
turned
in
time
to
see
another
shot
stream
out
of
the
darkness
where
a
sentry
was
firing
at
the
flash
of
his
gun
then
bent
himself
double
and
plunged
down
the
ditch
with
the
first
impact
overhead
the
men
poured
forth
from
their
quarters
armed
and
bristling
to
be
greeted
by
a
volley
of
gunshots
the
thud
of
bullets
and
the
dwindling
whine
of
spent
lead
they
leaped
from
shelter
to
find
themselves
girt
with
a
fitful
hoop
of
fire
for
the
stranglers
had
spread
in
the
arc
of
a
circle
and
now
emptied
their
rifles
towards
the
centre
the
defenders
however
maintained
surprising
order
considering
the
suddenness
of
their
attack
and
ran
to
join
the
sentries
whose
positions
could
be
determined
by
the
nearer
flashes
the
voice
of
a
man
in
authority
shouted
loud
commands
no
demonstration
came
from
the
outer
voids
nothing
but
the
wicked
streaks
that
stabbed
the
darkness
then
suddenly
behind
mcnamara
s
men
the
night
glared
luridly
as
though
a
great
had
opened
and
then
clanged
shut
while
with
it
came
a
hoarse
thudding
roar
that
silenced
the
rifle
play
they
saw
the
disrupt
itself
and
disintegrate
into
a
thousand
flying
timbers
and
twisted
sheets
of
tin
which
soared
upward
and
outward
over
their
heads
and
into
the
night
as
the
rocking
hills
ceased
echoing
the
sound
of
the
vigilantes
rifles
recurred
like
the
cracking
of
dry
sticks
then
everywhere
about
the
defenders
the
earth
was
lashed
by
falling
débris
while
the
iron
roofs
rang
at
the
fusillade
the
blast
had
come
at
their
very
elbows
and
they
were
too
dazed
and
shaken
by
it
to
grasp
its
significance
then
before
they
could
realize
what
it
boded
the
depths
lit
up
again
till
the
raindrops
were
outlined
distinct
and
glistening
like
a
gossamer
veil
of
silver
while
the
office
building
to
their
left
was
ripped
and
rended
and
the
adjoining
walls
leaped
out
into
sudden
relief
their
shattered
windows
looking
like
ghostly
sightless
eyes
the
curtain
of
darkness
closed
heavier
than
velvet
and
the
men
cowered
in
their
tracks
shielding
themselves
behind
the
nearest
objects
or
behind
one
another
s
bodies
waiting
for
the
sky
to
vomit
over
them
its
rain
of
missiles
their
backs
were
to
the
vigilantes
now
their
faces
to
the
centre
many
had
dropped
their
rifles
the
thunder
of
hoofs
and
the
scream
of
terrified
horses
came
from
the
stables
the
cry
of
a
maddened
beast
is
weird
and
calculated
to
curdle
the
blood
at
best
but
with
it
arose
a
human
voice
shrieking
from
pain
and
fear
of
death
a
wrenched
and
doubled
mass
of
zinc
had
hurtled
out
of
the
heavens
and
struck
some
one
down
the
choking
hoarseness
of
the
man
s
appeal
told
the
story
and
those
about
him
broke
into
flight
to
escape
what
might
follow
to
escape
this
danger
they
could
not
see
but
which
swooped
out
of
the
blackness
above
and
against
which
there
was
no
defence
they
fled
only
to
witness
another
and
greater
light
behind
them
by
which
they
saw
themselves
running
falling
grovelling
this
time
they
were
hurled
from
their
balance
by
a
concussion
which
dwarfed
the
two
preceding
ones
some
few
stood
still
staring
at
the
rolling
as
it
was
revealed
by
the
explosion
their
eyes
gleaming
white
while
others
buried
their
faces
in
their
hollowed
arms
as
if
to
shut
out
the
hellish
glare
or
to
shield
themselves
from
a
blow
out
in
the
heart
of
the
chaos
rang
a
voice
loud
and
clear
beware
the
next
blast
at
the
same
instant
the
girdle
of
rose
up
smiting
the
air
with
their
cries
and
charged
in
like
madmen
through
the
rain
of
detritus
they
fired
as
they
came
but
it
was
unnecessary
for
there
was
no
longer
a
fight
it
was
a
rout
the
defenders
feeling
they
had
escaped
destruction
only
by
a
happy
chance
in
leaving
the
the
instant
they
did
were
not
minded
to
tarry
here
where
the
heavens
fell
upon
their
heads
to
augment
their
consternation
the
horses
had
broken
from
their
stalls
and
were
plunging
through
the
confusion
fear
swept
over
the
men
blind
unreasoning
contagious
and
they
rushed
out
into
the
night
colliding
with
their
enemies
overrunning
them
in
the
panic
to
quit
this
spot
some
dashed
off
the
bluff
and
fell
among
the
pits
and
sluices
others
ran
up
the
and
cowered
in
the
brush
like
quail
as
the
stranglers
assembled
their
prisoners
near
the
ruins
they
heard
wounded
men
moaning
in
the
darkness
so
lit
torches
and
searched
out
the
stricken
ones
glenister
came
running
through
the
smoke
pall
revolver
in
hand
crying
has
any
one
seen
mcnamara
no
one
had
and
when
they
were
later
assembled
to
take
stock
of
their
injuries
he
was
greeted
by
dextry
s
gleeful
announcement
that
s
the
deuce
of
a
fight
we
ain
t
got
so
much
as
a
cold
sore
among
we
have
captured
fourteen
another
announced
and
there
may
be
more
out
yonder
in
the
glenister
noted
with
growing
surprise
that
not
one
of
the
prisoners
lined
up
beneath
the
glaring
torches
wore
the
army
blue
they
were
miners
all
or
thugs
and
ruffians
gathered
from
the
camp
where
he
wondered
were
the
soldiers
didn
t
you
have
troops
from
the
barracks
to
help
you
he
asked
not
a
troop
we
haven
t
seen
a
soldier
since
we
went
to
at
this
the
young
leader
became
alarmed
had
this
whole
attack
miscarried
had
this
been
no
clash
with
the
united
states
forces
after
all
if
so
the
news
would
never
reach
washington
and
instead
of
accomplishing
his
end
he
and
his
friends
had
thrust
themselves
into
the
realms
of
outlawry
where
the
soldiers
could
be
employed
against
them
with
impunity
where
prices
would
rest
upon
their
heads
innocent
blood
had
been
shed
court
property
destroyed
mcnamara
had
them
where
he
wanted
them
at
last
they
were
at
bay
the
unwounded
prisoners
were
taken
to
the
boundaries
of
the
midas
and
released
with
such
warnings
as
the
imagination
of
dextry
could
conjure
up
then
glenister
assembled
his
men
speaking
to
them
plainly
boys
this
is
no
victory
in
fact
we
re
worse
off
than
we
were
before
and
our
biggest
fight
is
coming
there
s
a
chance
to
get
away
now
before
daylight
and
before
we
re
recognized
but
if
we
re
seen
here
at
sunup
we
ll
have
to
stay
and
fight
soldiers
will
be
sent
against
us
but
if
we
hold
out
and
the
struggle
is
fierce
enough
it
may
reach
to
washington
this
will
be
a
different
kind
of
fighting
now
though
it
will
be
warfare
pure
and
simple
how
many
of
you
will
stick
all
of
us
said
they
in
unison
and
accordingly
preparations
for
a
siege
were
begun
barricades
were
built
ruins
removed
buildings
transformed
into
and
all
through
the
turbulent
night
the
tired
men
labored
till
ready
to
drop
led
always
by
the
young
giant
who
seemed
without
fatigue
it
was
perhaps
four
hours
after
midnight
when
a
man
sought
him
out
somebody
s
callin
you
on
the
assay
office
telephone
says
it
s
life
or
glenister
hurried
to
the
building
which
had
escaped
the
shock
of
the
explosions
and
taking
down
the
receiver
was
answered
by
cherry
malotte
thank
god
you
re
safe
she
began
the
men
have
just
come
in
and
the
whole
town
is
awake
over
the
riot
they
say
you
ve
killed
ten
people
in
the
fight
is
it
true
he
explained
to
her
briefly
that
all
was
well
but
she
broke
in
wait

mcnamara
has
called
for
troops
and
you
ll
all
be
shot
oh
what
a
terrible
night
it
has
been
i
haven
t
been
to
bed
i
m
going
mad
now
listen
carefully
yesterday
helen
went
with
struve
to
the
sign
of
the
sled
and
she
hasn
t
come
the
man
at
the
end
of
the
wire
cried
out
at
this
then
choked
back
his
words
to
hear
what
followed
his
free
hand
began
making
strange
futile
motions
as
though
he
traced
patterns
in
the
air
i
can
t
raise
the
on
the
wire
and
something
dreadful
has
happened
i
what
made
her
go
he
shouted
to
save
you
came
cherry
s
faint
reply
if
you
love
her
ride
fast
to
the
sign
of
the
sled
or
you
ll
be
too
late
the
bronco
kid
has
gone
there
at
that
name
roy
crashed
the
instrument
to
its
hook
and
burst
out
of
the
shanty
calling
loudly
to
his
men
what
s
up
where
are
you
going
to
the
sign
of
the
sled
he
panted
we
ve
stood
by
you
glenister
and
you
can
t
quit
us
like
this
said
one
angrily
the
trail
to
town
is
good
and
we
ll
take
it
if
you
roy
saw
they
feared
he
was
deserting
feared
that
he
had
heard
some
alarming
rumor
of
which
they
did
not
know
we
ll
let
the
mine
go
boys
for
i
can
t
ask
you
to
do
what
i
refuse
to
do
myself
and
yet
it
s
not
fear
that
s
sending
me
there
s
a
woman
in
danger
and
i
go
she
courted
ruin
to
save
us
all
risked
her
honor
to
try
and
right
a
wrong
and
i
m
afraid
of
what
has
happened
while
we
were
fighting
here
i
don
t
ask
you
to
stay
till
i
come
back
it
wouldn
t
be
square
and
you
d
better
go
while
you
have
a
chance
as
for
me
i
gave
up
the
old
claim
once
i
can
do
it
he
swung
himself
to
the
horse
s
back
settled
into
the
saddle
and
rode
out
through
the
lane
of
belted
men
chapter
xx
in
which
three
go
to
the
sign
of
the
sled
and
but
two
return
as
helen
and
her
companion
ascended
the
mountain
scarred
and
swept
by
the
tempest
of
the
previous
night
they
heard
far
below
the
swollen
torrent
brawling
in
its
bed
while
behind
them
the
angry
ocean
spread
southward
to
a
horizon
ahead
the
bleak
mountains
brooded
over
forbidding
valleys
to
the
west
a
suffused
sun
glared
sullenly
painting
the
clouds
with
the
gorgeous
hues
of
a
stormy
sunset
to
helen
the
wild
scene
seemed
dyed
with
the
colors
of
flame
and
blood
and
steel
that
rain
raised
the
deuce
with
the
trails
said
struve
as
they
picked
their
way
past
an
unsightly
slip
whence
a
part
of
the
overhanging
mountain
loosened
by
the
deluge
had
slid
into
the
gulch
another
storm
like
that
would
wash
out
these
roads
even
in
the
daylight
it
was
no
easy
task
to
avoid
these
danger
spots
for
the
horses
floundered
on
the
muddy
soil
vaguely
the
girl
wondered
how
she
would
find
her
way
back
in
the
darkness
as
she
had
planned
she
said
little
as
they
approached
the
for
the
thoughts
within
her
brain
had
begun
to
clamor
too
wildly
but
struve
more
arrogant
than
ever
before
more
terrifyingly
sure
of
himself
was
loudly
garrulous
as
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
dread
that
possessed
the
girl
became
of
paralyzing
intensity
if
she
should
fail
but
she
vowed
she
would
not
could
not
fail
they
rounded
a
bend
and
saw
the
sign
of
the
sled
cradled
below
them
where
the
trail
dipped
to
a
stream
which
tumbled
from
the
comb
above
into
the
river
twisting
like
a
silver
thread
through
the
distant
valley
a
peeled
topped
by
a
spruce
bough
stood
in
front
of
the
tavern
while
over
the
door
hung
a
sled
suspended
from
a
beam
the
house
itself
was
a
quaint
structure
rambling
and
amorphous
from
whose
sod
roof
sprang
blooming
flowers
and
whose
walls
were
pierced
here
and
there
with
sleepy
windows
it
had
been
built
by
a
homesick
foreigner
of
unknown
nationality
whom
the
army
of
mushers
who
paid
for
his
clean
and
orderly
hospitality
had
dubbed
duly
and
as
a
matter
of
course
a
when
travel
had
changed
to
the
river
trail
leaving
the
house
lonesome
and
high
as
though
left
by
a
receding
wave
struve
had
taken
it
over
on
a
debt
and
now
ran
it
for
the
convenience
of
a
slender
traffic
mainly
stampeders
who
chose
the
higher
route
towards
the
interior
his
hireling
spent
the
idle
hours
in
prospecting
a
hungry
quartz
lead
and
in
doing
assessment
work
on
claims
shortz
took
the
horses
and
answered
his
employer
s
questions
curtly
flashing
a
curious
look
at
helen
under
other
conditions
the
girl
would
have
been
delighted
with
the
place
for
this
was
the
quaintest
spot
she
had
found
in
the
north
country
the
main
room
held
bar
and
a
rude
table
and
a
huge
iron
heater
while
its
walls
and
ceiling
were
sheeted
with
white
cloth
so
cunningly
stitched
and
tacked
that
it
seemed
a
cavern
hollowed
from
chalk
it
was
filled
with
trophies
of
the
hills
stuffed
birds
and
animals
skins
and
antlers
from
which
depended
in
careless
confusion
dog
harness
guns
and
articles
of
clothing
a
door
to
the
left
led
into
the
where
travellers
had
been
wont
to
sleep
in
tiers
three
deep
to
the
rear
was
a
kitchen
and
cache
to
the
right
a
compartment
which
struve
called
the
art
gallery
here
free
reign
had
been
allowed
the
original
owner
s
artistic
fancies
and
he
had
covered
the
place
with
pictures
clipped
from
gazettes
of
questionable
repute
till
it
was
a
bewildering
arrangement
of
pink
ladies
in
tights
pugilists
in
scanty
trunks
prize
and
other
less
moral
characters
of
the
sporting
world
this
is
probably
the
worst
company
you
were
ever
in
struve
observed
to
helen
with
a
forced
attempt
at
lightness
are
there
no
guests
here
she
asked
him
her
anxiety
very
near
the
surface
travel
is
light
at
this
time
of
the
year
they
ll
come
in
later
a
fire
was
burning
in
this
pink
room
where
the
landlord
had
begun
spreading
the
table
for
two
and
its
warmth
was
grateful
to
the
girl
her
companion
thoroughly
at
his
ease
stretched
himself
on
a
couch
and
smoked
let
me
see
the
papers
now
struve
she
began
but
he
put
her
off
no
not
now
business
must
wait
on
our
dinner
don
t
spoil
our
little
party
for
there
s
time
enough
and
to
she
arose
and
went
to
the
window
unable
to
sit
still
looking
down
the
narrow
gulch
she
saw
that
the
mountains
beyond
were
indistinct
for
it
was
growing
dark
rapidly
dense
clouds
had
rolled
up
from
the
east
a
struck
the
glass
before
her
eyes
then
another
and
another
and
the
hills
grew
misty
behind
the
coming
shower
a
traveller
with
a
pack
on
his
back
hurried
around
the
corner
of
the
building
and
past
her
to
the
door
at
his
knock
struve
who
had
been
watching
helen
through
eyes
arose
and
went
into
the
other
room
thank
heaven
some
one
has
come
she
thought
the
voices
were
deadened
to
a
hum
by
the
sod
walls
till
that
of
the
stranger
raised
itself
in
such
indignant
protest
that
she
distinguished
his
words
oh
i
ve
got
money
to
pay
my
way
i
m
no
shortz
mumbled
something
back
i
don
t
care
if
you
are
closed
i
m
tired
and
there
s
a
storm
this
time
she
heard
the
landlord
s
refusal
and
the
miner
s
angry
profanity
a
moment
later
she
saw
the
traveller
plodding
up
the
trail
towards
town
what
does
that
mean
she
inquired
as
the
lawyer
oh
that
fellow
is
a
tough
and
shortz
wouldn
t
let
him
in
he
s
careful
whom
he
entertains
there
are
so
many
bad
men
roaming
the
the
german
came
in
shortly
to
light
the
lamp
and
although
she
asked
no
further
questions
helen
s
uneasiness
increased
she
half
listened
to
the
stories
with
which
struve
tried
to
entertain
her
and
ate
little
of
the
excellent
meal
that
was
shortly
served
to
them
struve
meanwhile
ate
and
drank
almost
greedily
and
the
shadowy
sinister
evening
crept
along
a
strange
cowardice
had
suddenly
overtaken
the
girl
and
if
at
this
late
hour
she
could
have
withdrawn
she
would
have
done
so
gladly
and
gone
forth
to
meet
the
violence
of
the
tempest
but
she
had
gone
too
far
for
retreat
and
realizing
that
for
the
present
apparent
compliance
was
her
wisest
resource
she
sat
quiet
answering
the
man
with
cool
words
while
his
eyes
grew
brighter
his
skin
more
flushed
his
speech
more
rapid
he
talked
incessantly
and
with
feverish
gayety
smoking
numberless
cigarettes
and
apparently
unconscious
of
the
flight
of
time
at
last
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
consulted
his
watch
while
helen
remembered
that
she
had
not
heard
shortz
in
the
kitchen
for
a
long
time
suddenly
struve
smiled
on
her
peculiarly
with
confident
cunning
as
he
leered
at
her
over
the
disorder
between
them
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
flat
bundle
which
he
tossed
to
her
now
for
the
bargain
eh
ask
the
man
to
remove
these
dishes
she
said
as
she
undid
the
parcel
with
clumsy
fingers
i
sent
him
away
two
hours
ago
said
struve
arising
as
if
to
come
to
her
she
shrank
back
but
he
only
leaned
across
gathered
up
the
four
corners
of
the
tablecloth
and
twisting
them
together
carried
the
whole
thing
out
the
dishes
crashing
and
jangling
as
he
threw
his
burden
recklessly
into
the
kitchen
then
he
returned
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
stove
staring
at
her
while
she
perused
the
contents
of
the
papers
which
were
more
voluminous
than
she
had
supposed
for
a
long
time
the
girl
pored
over
the
documents
the
purport
of
the
papers
was
only
too
obvious
and
as
she
read
the
proof
of
her
uncle
s
guilt
stood
out
clear
and
damning
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistake
the
whole
wretched
plot
stood
out
plain
its
darkest
infamies
revealed
in
spite
of
the
cruelty
of
her
disillusionment
helen
was
nevertheless
exalted
with
the
fierce
ecstasy
of
power
with
the
knowledge
that
justice
would
at
last
be
rendered
it
would
be
her
triumph
and
her
expiation
that
she
who
had
been
the
unwitting
tool
of
this
miserable
clique
would
be
the
one
through
whom
restitution
was
made
she
arose
with
her
eyes
gleaming
and
her
lips
set
it
is
of
course
it
is
enough
to
convict
us
all
it
means
the
penitentiary
for
your
precious
uncle
and
your
he
stretched
his
chin
upward
at
the
mention
as
though
to
free
his
throat
from
an
invisible
clutch
yes
your
lover
particularly
for
he
s
the
real
one
that
s
why
i
brought
you
here
he
ll
marry
you
but
i
ll
be
the
best
the
timbre
of
his
voice
was
unpleasant
come
let
us
go
she
said
go
he
chuckled
mirthlessly
that
s
a
fine
example
of
unconscious
what
do
you
mean
well
first
no
human
being
could
find
his
way
down
to
the
coast
in
this
tempest
second
but
let
me
explain
something
in
those
papers
while
i
think
of
he
spoke
casually
and
stepped
forward
reaching
for
the
package
which
she
was
about
to
give
up
when
something
prompted
her
to
snatch
it
behind
her
back
and
it
was
well
she
did
for
his
hand
was
but
a
few
inches
away
he
was
no
match
for
her
quickness
however
and
she
glided
around
the
table
thrusting
the
papers
into
the
front
of
her
dress
the
sudden
contact
with
cherry
s
revolver
gave
her
a
certain
comfort
she
spoke
now
with
determination
i
intend
to
leave
here
at
once
will
you
bring
my
horse
very
well
i
shall
do
it
she
turned
but
his
indolence
vanished
like
a
flash
and
springing
in
front
of
the
door
he
barred
her
way
hold
on
my
lady
you
ought
to
understand
without
my
saying
any
more
why
did
i
bring
you
here
why
did
i
plan
this
little
party
why
did
i
send
that
man
away
just
to
give
you
the
proof
of
my
complicity
in
a
crime
i
suppose
well
hardly
you
won
t
leave
here
and
when
you
do
you
won
t
carry
those
papers
my
own
safety
depends
on
that
and
i
am
selfish
so
don
t
get
me
started
listen
they
caught
the
wail
of
the
night
crying
as
though
hungry
for
sacrifice
no
you
ll
stay
here
and
he
broke
off
abruptly
for
helen
had
stepped
to
the
telephone
and
taken
down
the
receiver
he
leaped
snatched
it
from
her
and
then
tearing
the
instrument
loose
from
the
wall
raised
it
above
his
head
dashed
it
upon
the
floor
and
sprang
towards
her
but
she
wrenched
herself
free
and
fled
across
the
room
the
man
s
white
hair
was
wildly
tumbled
his
face
was
purple
and
his
neck
and
throat
showed
swollen
throbbing
veins
he
stood
still
however
and
his
lips
cracked
into
his
cautious
smile
now
don
t
let
s
fight
about
this
it
s
no
use
for
i
ve
played
to
win
you
have
your
proof
now
i
ll
have
my
price
or
else
i
ll
take
it
think
over
which
it
will
be
while
i
lock
far
down
the
a
man
was
urging
a
broken
pony
recklessly
along
the
trail
the
beast
was
blown
and
spent
its
knees
weak
and
bending
yet
the
rider
forced
it
as
though
behind
him
yelled
a
thousand
devils
spurring
headlong
through
gully
and
ford
up
steep
slopes
and
down
invisible
ravines
sometimes
the
animal
stumbled
and
fell
with
its
master
sometimes
they
arose
together
but
the
man
was
heedless
of
all
except
his
haste
insensible
to
the
rain
which
smote
him
blindingly
and
to
the
wind
which
seized
him
savagely
upon
the
ridges
or
gasped
at
him
in
the
gullies
with
exhausted
malice
at
last
he
gained
the
plateau
and
saw
the
light
beneath
so
drove
his
heels
into
the
flanks
of
the
creature
which
lunged
forward
gamely
he
felt
the
pony
rear
and
drop
away
beneath
him
pawing
and
scrambling
and
instinctively
kicked
his
feet
free
from
the
stirrups
striving
to
throw
himself
out
of
the
saddle
and
clear
of
the
thrashing
hoofs
it
seemed
that
he
turned
over
in
the
air
before
something
smote
him
and
he
lay
still
his
gaunt
dark
face
upturned
to
the
rain
while
about
him
the
storm
screamed
exultantly
the
moment
struve
disappeared
into
the
outer
room
helen
darted
to
the
window
it
was
merely
a
single
sash
nailed
fast
and
immovable
but
seizing
one
of
the
little
stools
beside
the
stove
she
thrust
it
through
the
glass
letting
in
a
smother
of
wind
and
water
before
she
could
escape
struve
bounded
into
the
room
his
face
livid
with
anger
his
voice
hoarse
and
furious
but
as
he
began
to
denounce
her
he
paused
in
amazement
for
the
girl
had
drawn
cherry
s
weapon
and
levelled
it
at
him
she
was
very
pale
and
her
breast
heaved
as
from
a
swift
run
while
her
wondrous
gray
eyes
were
lit
with
a
light
no
man
had
ever
seen
there
before
glowing
like
two
jewels
whose
hearts
contained
the
passion
of
centuries
she
had
altered
as
though
under
the
deft
hand
of
a
her
nostrils
growing
thin
and
arched
her
lips
tight
pressed
and
pitiless
her
head
poised
proudly
the
rain
drove
in
through
the
shattered
window
over
and
past
her
while
the
cheap
red
curtain
lashed
and
whipped
her
as
though
in
gleeful
applause
her
bitter
abhorrence
of
the
man
made
her
voice
sound
strangely
unnatural
as
she
commanded
don
t
dare
to
stop
she
moved
towards
the
door
motioning
him
to
retreat
before
her
and
he
obeyed
recognizing
the
danger
of
her
coolness
she
did
not
note
the
calculating
treachery
of
his
glance
however
nor
fathom
the
purposes
he
had
in
mind
out
on
the
mountain
the
prostrate
rider
had
regained
his
senses
and
now
was
crawling
painfully
towards
the
seen
through
the
dark
he
would
have
resembled
some
misshapen
creeping
monster
for
he
dragged
himself
close
to
the
ground
but
as
he
came
closer
the
man
heard
a
cry
which
the
wind
seemed
guarding
from
his
ear
and
hearing
it
he
rose
and
rushed
blindly
forward
staggering
like
a
wounded
beast
helen
watched
her
captive
closely
as
he
backed
through
the
door
before
her
for
she
dared
not
lose
sight
of
him
until
free
the
middle
room
was
lighted
by
a
glass
lamp
on
the
bar
and
its
rays
showed
that
the
was
secured
by
a
large
iron
bolt
she
thanked
heaven
there
was
no
lock
and
key
struve
had
retreated
until
his
back
was
to
the
counter
offering
no
word
making
no
move
but
the
darting
brightness
of
his
eyes
showed
that
he
was
alert
and
planning
but
when
the
door
behind
helen
urged
by
the
wind
through
the
broken
casement
banged
to
the
man
made
his
first
sign
he
dashed
the
lamp
to
the
floor
where
it
burst
like
an
and
darkness
leaped
into
the
room
as
an
animal
pounces
had
she
been
calmer
or
had
time
for
an
instant
s
thought
helen
would
have
hastened
back
to
the
light
but
she
was
midway
to
her
liberty
and
actuated
by
the
sole
desire
to
break
out
into
the
open
air
so
plunged
forward
without
warning
she
was
hurled
from
her
feet
by
a
body
which
came
out
of
the
darkness
upon
her
she
fired
the
little
gun
but
struve
s
arms
closed
about
her
the
weapon
was
wrenched
from
her
hand
and
she
found
herself
fighting
against
him
breast
to
breast
with
the
fury
of
desperation
his
breath
beat
into
her
face
and
she
felt
herself
bound
to
him
as
though
by
hoops
while
the
touch
of
his
cheek
against
hers
turned
her
into
a
terrified
insensate
animal
which
fought
with
every
ounce
of
its
strength
and
every
nerve
of
its
body
she
screamed
once
but
it
was
not
like
the
cry
of
a
woman
then
the
struggle
went
on
in
silence
and
utter
blackness
struve
holding
her
like
a
gorilla
till
she
grew
faint
and
her
head
began
to
whirl
while
darting
lights
drove
past
her
eyes
and
there
was
the
roar
of
a
cataract
in
her
ears
she
was
a
strong
girl
and
her
ripe
young
body
untried
until
this
moment
answered
in
every
fibre
so
that
she
wrestled
with
almost
a
man
s
strength
and
he
had
hard
shift
to
hold
her
but
so
violent
an
encounter
could
not
last
helen
felt
herself
drifting
free
from
the
earth
and
losing
grip
of
all
things
tangible
when
at
last
they
tripped
and
fell
against
the
inner
door
this
gave
way
and
at
the
same
moment
the
man
s
strength
departed
as
though
it
were
a
thing
of
darkness
and
dared
not
face
the
light
that
streamed
over
them
she
tore
herself
from
his
clutch
and
staggered
into
the
her
loosened
hair
falling
in
a
gleaming
torrent
about
her
shoulders
while
he
arose
from
his
knees
and
came
towards
her
again
gasping
i
ll
show
you
who
s
master
here
then
he
ceased
abruptly
cringingly
and
threw
up
an
arm
before
his
face
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow
framed
in
the
window
was
the
pallid
visage
of
a
man
the
air
rocked
the
lamp
flared
and
struve
whirled
completely
around
falling
back
against
the
wall
his
eyes
filled
with
horror
and
shifted
down
where
his
hand
had
clutched
at
his
breast
plucking
at
one
spot
as
if
tearing
a
barb
from
his
bosom
he
jerked
his
head
towards
the
door
at
his
elbow
in
quest
of
a
retreat
a
shudder
ran
over
him
his
knees
buckled
and
he
plunged
forward
upon
his
face
his
arm
still
doubled
under
him
it
had
happened
like
a
flash
of
light
and
although
helen
felt
rather
than
heard
the
shot
and
saw
her
assailant
fall
she
did
not
realize
the
meaning
of
it
till
a
drift
of
powder
smoke
assailed
her
nostrils
even
so
she
experienced
no
shock
nor
horror
of
the
sight
on
the
contrary
a
savage
joy
at
the
spectacle
seized
her
and
she
stood
still
leaning
slightly
forward
staring
at
it
almost
gloatingly
stood
so
till
she
heard
her
name
called
helen
little
sister
and
turning
saw
her
brother
in
the
window
that
which
he
witnessed
in
her
face
he
had
seen
before
in
the
faces
of
men
locked
close
with
a
hateful
death
and
from
whom
all
but
the
most
elemental
passions
had
departed
but
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
bear
the
marks
till
now
no
artifice
nor
falsity
was
there
nothing
but
the
crudest
intensest
feeling
which
many
people
live
and
die
without
knowing
there
are
few
who
come
to
know
the
great
primitive
passionate
longings
but
in
this
black
night
fighting
in
defence
of
her
most
sacred
self
this
girl
s
nature
had
been
stripped
to
its
purely
savage
elements
as
glenister
had
predicted
helen
at
last
had
felt
and
yielded
to
irresistibly
powerful
impulse
glancing
backward
at
the
creature
sprawled
by
the
door
helen
went
to
her
brother
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
he
s
dead
the
kid
asked
her
she
nodded
and
tried
to
speak
but
began
to
shiver
and
sob
instead
unlock
the
door
he
begged
her
i
m
hurt
and
i
must
get
when
the
kid
had
hobbled
into
the
room
she
pressed
him
to
her
and
stroked
his
matted
head
regardless
of
his
muddy
soaking
garments
i
must
look
at
him
he
may
not
be
badly
hurt
said
the
kid
don
t
touch
him
she
followed
nevertheless
and
stood
near
by
while
her
brother
examined
his
victim
struve
was
breathing
and
discovering
this
the
others
lifted
him
with
difficulty
to
the
couch
something
cracked
in
here
ribs
i
guess
the
kid
remarked
gasping
and
feeling
his
own
side
he
was
weak
and
pale
and
the
girl
led
him
into
the
where
he
could
lie
down
only
his
wonderful
determination
had
sustained
him
thus
far
and
now
the
knowledge
of
his
helplessness
served
to
prevent
helen
s
collapse
the
kid
would
not
hear
of
her
going
for
help
till
the
storm
abated
or
daylight
came
insisting
that
the
trails
were
too
treacherous
and
that
no
time
could
be
saved
by
doing
so
thus
they
waited
for
the
dawn
at
last
they
heard
the
wounded
man
faintly
calling
he
spoke
to
helen
hoarsely
there
was
no
malice
only
fear
in
his
tones
i
said
this
was
my
madness
and
i
got
what
i
deserved
but
i
m
going
to
die
o
god
i
m
going
to
die
and
i
m
he
moaned
till
the
bronco
kid
hobbled
in
glaring
with
unquenched
hatred
yes
you
re
going
to
die
and
i
did
it
be
game
can
t
you
i
sha
n
t
let
her
go
for
help
until
helen
forced
her
brother
back
to
his
couch
and
returned
to
help
the
wounded
man
who
grew
incoherent
and
began
to
babble
a
little
later
when
the
kid
seemed
stronger
and
his
head
clearer
helen
ventured
to
tell
him
of
their
uncle
s
villany
and
of
the
proof
she
held
with
her
hope
of
restoring
justice
she
told
him
of
the
attack
planned
that
very
night
and
of
the
danger
which
threatened
the
miners
he
questioned
her
closely
and
realising
the
bearing
of
her
story
crept
to
the
door
casting
the
wind
like
a
hound
we
ll
have
to
risk
it
said
he
the
wind
is
almost
gone
and
it
s
not
long
till
she
pleaded
to
go
alone
but
he
was
firm
i
ll
never
leave
you
again
and
moreover
i
know
the
lower
trail
quite
well
we
ll
go
down
the
gulch
to
the
valley
and
reach
town
that
way
it
s
farther
but
it
s
not
so
you
can
t
ride
she
insisted
i
can
if
you
ll
tie
me
into
the
saddle
come
get
the
it
was
still
pitchy
dark
and
the
rain
was
pouring
but
the
wind
only
sighed
weakly
as
though
tired
by
its
violence
when
she
helped
the
bronco
into
his
saddle
the
effort
wrenched
a
groan
from
him
but
he
insisted
upon
her
tying
his
feet
beneath
the
horse
s
belly
saying
that
the
trail
was
rough
and
he
could
take
no
chance
of
falling
again
so
having
performed
the
last
services
she
might
for
struve
she
mounted
her
own
animal
and
allowed
it
to
pick
its
way
down
the
steep
descent
behind
her
brother
who
swayed
and
lurched
drunkenly
in
his
seat
gripping
the
horn
before
him
with
both
hands
they
had
been
gone
perhaps
a
when
another
horse
plunged
furiously
out
of
the
darkness
and
halted
before
the
door
its
rider
and
dishevelled
flung
himself
in
mad
haste
to
the
ground
and
bolted
in
through
the
door
he
saw
the
signs
of
confusion
in
the
outer
room
chairs
upset
and
broken
the
table
wedged
against
the
stove
and
before
the
counter
a
shattered
lamp
in
a
pool
of
oil
he
called
loudly
but
receiving
no
answer
snatched
a
light
which
he
found
burning
and
ran
to
the
door
at
his
left
nothing
greeted
him
but
the
empty
tiers
of
bunks
turning
he
crossed
to
the
other
side
and
burst
through
another
lamp
was
lighted
beside
the
couch
where
struve
lay
breathing
heavily
his
lids
half
closed
over
his
staring
eyes
roy
noted
the
pool
of
blood
at
his
feet
and
the
broken
window
then
setting
down
his
lamp
he
leaned
over
the
man
and
spoke
to
him
when
he
received
no
answer
he
spoke
again
loudly
then
in
a
frenzy
glenister
shook
the
wounded
man
cruelly
so
that
he
cried
out
in
terror
i
m
dying
oh
i
m
roy
raised
the
sick
man
up
and
thrust
his
own
face
before
his
eyes
this
is
glenister
i
ve
come
for
helen
where
is
she
a
spark
of
recognition
flickered
into
the
dull
stare
you
re
too
late
i
m
dying
and
i
m
his
questioner
shook
struve
again
where
is
she
he
repeated
time
after
time
till
by
very
force
of
his
own
insistence
he
compelled
realization
in
the
sufferer
the
kid
took
her
away
the
kid
shot
me
and
then
his
voice
rose
till
it
flooded
the
room
with
terror
the
kid
shot
me
and
i
m
he
coughed
blood
to
his
lips
at
which
roy
laid
him
back
and
stood
up
so
there
was
no
mistake
after
all
and
he
had
arrived
too
late
this
was
the
kid
s
revenge
this
was
how
he
struck
lacking
courage
to
face
a
man
s
level
eyes
he
possessed
the
foulness
to
prey
upon
a
woman
roy
felt
a
weakening
physical
sickness
sweep
over
him
till
his
eye
fell
upon
a
sodden
garment
which
helen
had
removed
from
her
brother
s
shoulders
and
replaced
with
a
dry
one
he
snatched
it
from
the
floor
and
in
a
sudden
fury
felt
it
come
apart
in
his
hands
like
wet
he
found
himself
out
in
the
rain
scanning
the
trampled
soil
by
light
of
his
lamp
and
discerned
tracks
which
the
drizzle
had
not
yet
erased
he
reasoned
mechanically
that
the
two
riders
could
have
no
great
start
of
him
so
strode
out
beyond
the
house
to
see
if
they
had
gone
farther
into
the
hills
there
were
no
tracks
here
therefore
they
must
have
doubled
back
towards
town
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
they
might
have
left
the
beaten
path
and
followed
down
the
little
creek
to
the
river
but
replacing
the
light
where
he
had
found
it
he
remounted
and
lashed
his
horse
into
a
stiff
canter
up
towards
the
divide
that
lay
between
him
and
the
city
the
story
was
growing
plainer
to
him
though
as
yet
he
could
not
piece
it
all
together
its
possibilities
stabbed
him
with
such
horror
that
he
cried
out
aloud
and
beat
his
steed
into
faster
time
with
both
hands
and
feet
to
think
of
those
two
ruffians
fighting
over
this
girl
as
though
she
were
the
spoils
of
pillage
he
must
overtake
the
kid
he
the
possibility
that
he
might
not
threw
him
into
such
ungovernable
mental
chaos
that
he
was
forced
to
calm
himself
men
went
mad
that
way
he
could
not
think
of
it
that
gasping
creature
in
the
spoke
all
too
well
of
the
bronco
s
determination
and
yet
who
of
those
who
had
known
the
kid
in
the
past
would
dream
that
his
vileness
was
so
utter
as
this
away
to
the
right
hidden
among
the
shadowed
hills
his
friends
rested
themselves
for
the
coming
battle
waiting
impatiently
his
return
and
timing
it
to
the
rising
sun
down
in
the
valley
to
his
left
were
the
two
he
followed
while
he
obsessed
and
unreasoning
now
cursing
like
a
madman
now
grim
and
silent
spurred
southward
towards
town
and
into
the
ranks
of
his
enemies
chapter
xxi
the
day
was
breaking
as
glenister
came
down
the
mountain
with
the
first
light
he
halted
to
scan
the
trail
and
having
no
means
of
knowing
that
the
fresh
tracks
he
found
were
not
those
of
the
two
riders
he
followed
he
urged
his
lathered
horse
ahead
till
he
became
suddenly
conscious
that
he
was
very
tired
and
had
not
slept
for
two
days
and
nights
the
recollection
did
not
reassure
the
young
man
for
his
body
was
a
weapon
which
must
not
fail
in
the
slightest
measure
now
that
there
was
work
to
do
even
the
unwelcome
speculation
upon
his
physical
handicap
offered
relief
however
from
the
agony
which
fed
upon
him
whenever
he
thought
of
helen
in
the
gambler
s
hands
meanwhile
the
horse
groaning
at
his
master
s
violence
plunged
onward
towards
the
roofs
of
nome
now
growing
gray
in
the
first
dawn
it
seemed
years
since
roy
had
seen
the
sunlight
for
this
night
burdened
with
suspense
had
been
endlessly
long
his
body
was
faint
beneath
the
strain
and
yet
he
rode
on
and
on
tired
dogged
stony
his
eyes
set
towards
the
sea
his
mind
a
storm
of
formless
whirling
thoughts
beneath
which
was
an
undeviating
implacable
determination
he
knew
now
that
he
had
sacrificed
all
hope
of
the
midas
and
likewise
the
hope
of
helen
was
gone
in
fact
he
began
to
realize
dimly
that
from
the
beginning
he
had
never
had
the
possibility
of
winning
her
that
she
had
never
been
destined
for
him
and
that
his
love
for
her
had
been
sent
as
a
light
by
which
he
was
to
find
himself
he
had
failed
everywhere
he
had
become
an
outlaw
he
had
fought
and
gone
down
certain
only
of
his
rectitude
and
the
mastery
of
his
unruly
spirit
now
the
hour
had
come
when
he
would
perform
his
last
mission
deriving
therefrom
that
satisfaction
which
the
gods
could
not
deny
he
would
have
his
vengeance
the
scheme
took
form
without
conscious
effort
on
his
part
and
embraced
two
things
the
death
of
the
gambler
and
a
meeting
with
mcnamara
of
the
former
he
had
no
more
doubt
than
that
the
sun
rising
there
would
sink
in
the
west
so
well
confirmed
was
this
belief
that
the
details
did
not
engage
his
thought
but
on
the
result
of
the
other
encounter
he
speculated
with
some
interest
from
the
first
mcnamara
had
been
a
riddle
to
him
and
mystery
breeds
curiosity
his
blind
instinctive
hatred
of
the
man
had
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
mania
but
as
to
what
the
outcome
would
be
when
they
met
face
to
face
fate
alone
could
tell
anyway
mcnamara
should
never
have
helen
roy
believed
his
mission
covered
that
point
as
well
as
her
deliverance
from
the
bronco
kid
when
he
had
finished
he
would
pay
the
price
if
he
had
the
luck
to
escape
he
would
go
back
to
his
hills
and
his
solitude
if
he
did
not
his
future
would
be
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
he
entered
the
silent
streets
unobserved
for
the
mists
were
heavy
and
low
smoke
columns
arose
vertically
in
the
still
air
the
rain
had
ceased
having
beaten
down
the
waves
which
rumbled
against
the
beach
filling
the
streets
with
their
subdued
thunder
a
ship
anchored
in
the
offing
had
run
in
from
the
lee
of
sledge
island
with
the
first
lull
while
midway
to
the
shore
a
tender
was
rising
and
falling
its
oars
flashing
like
the
silvered
feelers
of
a
sea
insect
crawling
upon
the
surface
of
the
ocean
he
rode
down
front
street
heedless
of
danger
heedless
of
the
comment
his
appearance
might
create
and
unseen
entered
his
enemy
s
stronghold
he
passed
a
through
the
windows
of
which
came
a
sickly
yellow
gleam
a
man
came
out
unsteadily
and
stared
at
the
horseman
then
passed
on
glenister
s
plan
was
to
go
straight
to
the
northern
and
from
there
to
track
down
its
owner
relentlessly
but
in
order
to
reach
the
place
his
course
led
him
past
the
office
of
dunham
struve
this
brought
back
to
his
mind
the
man
dying
out
there
ten
miles
at
his
back
the
scantiest
humanity
demanded
that
assistance
be
sent
at
once
yet
he
dared
not
give
word
openly
thus
betraying
his
presence
for
it
was
necessary
that
he
maintain
his
liberty
during
the
next
hour
at
all
hazards
he
suddenly
thought
of
an
expedient
and
reined
in
his
horse
which
stopped
with
legs
and
dejected
head
while
he
dismounted
and
climbed
the
stairs
to
leave
a
note
upon
the
door
some
one
would
see
the
message
shortly
and
recognize
its
urgency
in
dressing
for
the
battle
at
the
midas
on
the
previous
night
he
had
replaced
his
leather
boots
with
mukluks
which
are
waterproof
light
and
pliable
footgear
made
from
the
skin
of
seal
and
walrus
he
was
thus
able
to
move
as
noiselessly
as
though
in
moccasins
finding
neither
pencil
nor
paper
in
his
pocket
he
tried
the
outer
door
of
the
office
to
find
it
unlocked
he
stepped
inside
and
listened
then
moved
towards
a
table
on
which
were
writing
materials
but
in
doing
so
heard
a
rustle
in
struve
s
private
office
evidently
his
soft
soles
had
not
disturbed
the
man
inside
roy
was
about
to
tiptoe
out
as
he
had
come
when
the
hidden
man
cleared
his
throat
it
is
in
these
involuntary
sounds
that
the
voice
retains
its
natural
quality
more
distinctly
even
than
in
speaking
a
strange
eagerness
grew
in
glenister
s
face
and
he
approached
the
partition
stealthily
it
was
of
wood
and
glass
the
panes
clouded
and
opaque
to
a
height
of
some
six
feet
but
stepping
upon
a
chair
he
peered
into
the
room
beyond
a
man
knelt
in
a
litter
of
papers
before
the
open
safe
its
drawers
and
compartments
removed
and
their
contents
scattered
the
watcher
lowered
himself
drew
his
gun
and
laid
soft
hand
upon
the
turning
the
latch
with
firm
fingers
his
vengeance
had
come
to
meet
him
after
lying
in
wait
during
the
long
night
certain
that
the
vigilantes
would
spring
his
trap
mcnamara
was
astounded
at
news
of
the
battle
at
the
midas
and
of
glenister
s
success
he
stormed
and
cursed
his
men
as
cowards
the
judge
became
greatly
exercised
over
this
new
development
which
coupled
with
his
night
of
long
anxiety
reduced
him
to
a
pitiful
hysteria
they
ll
blow
up
next
great
heavens
dynamite
oh
that
is
barbarous
for
heaven
s
sake
get
the
soldiers
out
ay
we
can
use
them
thereupon
mcnamara
roused
the
commanding
officer
at
the
post
and
requested
him
to
accoutre
a
troop
and
have
them
ready
to
march
at
daylight
then
bestirred
the
judge
to
start
the
wheels
of
his
court
and
invoke
this
military
aid
in
regular
fashion
make
it
all
a
matter
of
record
he
said
we
want
to
keep
our
skirts
clear
from
now
but
the
are
against
us
quavered
stillman
they
ll
tear
us
to
let
em
try
once
i
get
my
hand
on
the
ringleader
the
rest
may
riot
and
be
although
he
had
made
less
display
than
had
the
judge
the
receiver
was
no
less
deeply
worried
about
helen
of
whom
no
news
came
his
jealousy
fanned
to
red
heat
by
the
discovery
of
her
earlier
defection
was
enhanced
fourfold
by
the
thought
of
this
last
adventure
something
told
him
there
was
treachery
afoot
and
when
she
did
not
return
at
dawn
he
began
to
fear
that
she
had
cast
in
her
lot
with
the
rioters
this
aroused
a
perfect
delirium
of
doubt
and
anger
till
he
reasoned
further
that
struve
having
gone
with
her
must
also
be
a
traitor
he
recognized
the
menace
in
this
fact
knowing
the
man
s
venality
so
began
to
reckon
carefully
its
significance
what
could
struve
do
what
proof
had
he
mcnamara
started
and
seizing
his
hat
hurried
straight
to
the
lawyer
s
office
and
let
himself
in
with
the
key
he
carried
it
was
light
enough
for
him
to
decipher
the
characters
on
the
safe
lock
as
he
turned
the
combination
so
he
set
to
work
scanning
the
endless
bundles
within
hoping
that
after
all
the
man
had
taken
with
him
no
incriminating
evidence
once
the
searcher
paused
at
some
fancied
sound
but
when
nothing
came
of
it
drew
his
revolver
and
laid
it
before
him
just
inside
the
safe
door
and
close
beneath
his
hand
continuing
to
run
through
the
documents
while
his
uneasiness
increased
he
had
been
engaged
so
for
some
time
when
he
heard
the
faintest
creak
at
his
back
too
slight
to
alarm
and
just
sufficient
to
break
his
tension
and
cause
him
to
jerk
his
head
about
framed
in
the
open
door
stood
roy
glenister
watching
him
mcnamara
s
astonishment
was
so
genuine
that
he
leaped
to
his
feet
faced
about
and
prompted
by
a
secretive
instinct
swung
to
the
safe
door
as
though
to
guard
its
contents
he
had
acted
upon
the
impulse
before
realizing
that
his
weapon
was
inside
and
that
now
although
the
door
was
not
locked
it
would
require
that
one
dangerous
yes
fatal
second
to
open
it
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
for
a
time
silent
and
malignant
their
glances
meeting
like
blades
in
the
older
man
s
face
a
look
of
defiance
in
the
younger
s
a
dogged
and
enmity
mcnamara
s
first
perturbation
left
him
calm
alert
dangerous
whereas
the
continued
contemplation
of
his
enemy
worked
in
glenister
to
destroy
his
composure
and
his
purpose
blazed
forth
unhidden
he
stood
there
unkempt
and
soiled
the
clean
sweep
of
jaw
and
throat
overgrown
with
a
three
days
black
stubble
his
hair
wet
and
matted
his
whole
left
side
foul
with
clay
where
he
had
fallen
in
the
darkness
a
muddy
red
streak
spread
downward
from
a
cut
above
his
temple
beneath
his
eyes
were
sagging
folds
while
the
flicker
at
his
mouth
corners
betrayed
the
high
nervous
pitch
to
which
he
was
keyed
i
have
come
for
the
last
act
mcnamara
now
we
ll
have
it
out
man
to
the
politician
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
have
the
drop
on
me
i
am
at
which
the
miner
s
face
lighted
fiercely
and
he
chuckled
ah
that
s
almost
too
good
to
be
true
i
have
dreamed
about
such
a
thing
and
i
have
been
hungry
to
feel
your
throat
since
the
first
time
i
saw
you
it
s
grown
on
me
till
shooting
wouldn
t
satisfy
me
ever
had
the
feeling
well
i
m
going
to
choke
the
life
out
of
you
with
my
bare
mcnamara
squared
himself
i
wouldn
t
advise
you
to
try
it
i
have
lived
longer
than
you
and
i
was
never
beaten
but
i
know
the
feeling
you
speak
about
i
have
it
his
eyes
roved
rapidly
up
and
down
the
other
s
form
noting
the
lean
thighs
and
belt
which
lent
the
appearance
of
spareness
belied
only
by
the
neck
and
shoulders
he
had
beaten
better
men
and
he
reasoned
that
if
it
came
to
a
physical
test
in
these
cramped
quarters
his
own
great
weight
would
more
than
offset
any
superior
agility
the
miner
might
possess
the
longer
he
looked
the
more
he
yielded
to
his
hatred
of
the
man
before
him
and
the
more
cruelly
he
longed
to
satisfy
it
take
off
your
coat
said
glenister
now
turn
around
all
right
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
lying
about
your
i
ll
kill
you
cried
mcnamara
glenister
laid
his
upon
the
safe
and
slipped
off
his
own
wet
garment
the
difference
was
more
marked
now
and
the
advantage
more
strongly
with
the
receiver
though
they
had
avoided
allusion
to
it
each
knew
that
this
fight
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
midas
and
each
realized
whence
sprang
their
fierce
enmity
and
it
was
meet
that
they
should
come
together
thus
it
had
been
the
one
certain
and
logical
event
which
they
had
felt
inevitably
approaching
from
long
back
and
it
was
fitting
moreover
that
they
should
fight
alone
and
unwitnessed
armed
only
with
the
weapons
of
the
wilderness
for
they
were
both
of
the
far
free
lands
were
both
of
the
fighter
s
type
and
had
both
warred
for
the
first
great
prize
they
met
ferociously
mcnamara
aimed
a
fearful
blow
but
glenister
met
him
squarely
beating
him
off
cleverly
stepping
in
and
out
his
arms
swinging
loosely
from
his
shoulders
like
whalebone
withes
tipped
with
lead
he
moved
lightly
his
footing
made
doubly
secure
by
reason
of
his
mukluks
recognizing
his
opponent
s
greater
weight
he
undertook
merely
to
stop
the
headlong
rushes
and
remain
out
of
reach
as
long
as
possible
he
struck
the
politician
fairly
in
the
mouth
so
that
the
man
s
head
snapped
back
and
his
fists
went
wild
then
before
the
arms
could
grasp
him
the
miner
had
broken
ground
and
whipped
another
blow
across
but
mcnamara
was
a
boxer
himself
so
covered
and
blocked
it
the
politician
spat
through
his
mashed
lips
and
rushed
again
sweeping
his
opponent
from
his
feet
again
glenister
s
fist
shot
forward
like
a
lump
of
granite
but
the
other
came
on
head
down
and
the
blow
finished
too
high
landing
on
the
big
man
s
brow
a
sudden
darting
agony
paralyzed
roy
s
hand
and
he
realized
that
he
had
broken
the
metacarpal
bones
and
that
henceforth
it
would
be
useless
before
he
could
recover
mcnamara
had
passed
under
his
extended
arm
and
seized
him
by
the
middle
then
thrusting
his
left
leg
back
of
roy
s
he
whirled
him
from
his
balance
flinging
him
clear
and
with
resistless
force
it
seemed
that
a
fatal
fall
must
follow
but
the
youth
squirmed
catlike
in
the
air
landing
with
set
muscles
which
rebounded
like
rubber
even
so
the
receiver
was
upon
him
before
he
could
rise
reaching
for
the
young
man
s
throat
with
his
heavy
hands
roy
recognized
the
fatal
strangle
hold
and
seizing
his
enemy
s
wrists
endeavored
to
tear
them
apart
but
his
left
hand
was
useless
so
with
a
mighty
wrench
he
freed
himself
and
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
the
men
strained
and
swayed
about
the
office
till
their
neck
veins
were
bursting
their
muscles
paralyzed
men
may
fight
duels
calmly
may
shoot
or
parry
or
thrust
with
cold
deliberation
but
when
there
comes
the
jar
of
body
to
body
the
sweaty
contact
of
skin
to
skin
the
play
of
iron
muscles
the
painful
gasp
of
exhaustion
then
the
mind
goes
skittering
back
into
its
dark
recesses
while
every
venomous
passion
leaps
forth
from
its
and
joins
in
the
horrid
war
they
tripped
across
the
floor
crashing
into
the
partition
which
split
showering
them
with
glass
they
fell
and
rolled
in
it
then
by
consent
wrenched
themselves
apart
and
rose
eye
to
eye
their
jaws
hanging
their
lungs
wheezing
their
faces
trickling
blood
and
sweat
roy
s
left
hand
pained
him
excruciatingly
while
mcnamara
s
macerated
lips
had
turned
outward
in
a
hideous
pout
they
crouched
so
for
an
instant
cruel
bestial
then
clinched
again
the
were
wrecked
utterly
and
the
room
became
a
litter
of
ruins
the
men
s
garments
fell
away
till
their
breasts
were
bare
and
their
arms
swelled
white
and
knotted
through
the
rags
they
knew
no
pain
their
bodies
were
insensate
mechanisms
gradually
the
older
man
s
face
was
beaten
into
a
shapeless
mass
by
the
other
s
cunning
blows
while
glenister
s
every
bone
was
wrenched
and
twisted
under
his
enemy
s
terrible
onslaughts
the
miner
s
chief
effort
it
is
true
was
to
keep
his
feet
and
to
break
the
man
s
embraces
never
had
he
encountered
one
whom
he
could
not
beat
by
sheer
strength
till
he
met
this
great
snarling
creature
who
worried
him
hither
and
yon
as
though
he
were
a
child
time
and
again
roy
beat
upon
the
man
s
face
with
the
blows
of
a
sledge
no
rules
governed
this
solitary
combat
the
men
were
deaf
to
all
but
the
roaring
in
their
ears
blinded
to
all
but
hate
insensible
to
everything
but
the
blood
mania
their
trampling
feet
caused
the
building
to
rumble
and
shake
as
though
some
monster
were
running
amuck
meanwhile
a
bareheaded
man
rushed
out
of
the
store
beneath
bumping
into
a
pedestrian
who
had
paused
on
the
sidewalk
and
together
they
scurried
up
the
stairs
the
dory
which
roy
had
seen
at
sea
had
shot
the
breakers
and
now
its
three
passengers
were
tracking
through
the
wet
sand
towards
front
street
bill
wheaton
in
the
lead
he
was
followed
by
two
rawboned
men
who
travelled
without
baggage
the
city
was
awakening
with
the
sun
which
reared
a
copper
rim
out
of
the
sea
judge
stillman
and
voorhees
came
down
from
the
hotel
and
paused
to
gaze
through
the
mists
at
a
caravan
of
mule
teams
which
trotted
into
the
other
end
of
the
street
with
jingle
and
clank
the
wagons
were
blue
with
soldiers
the
early
golden
rays
slanting
from
their
krags
and
they
were
bound
for
the
midas
out
of
the
fogs
which
clung
so
thickly
to
the
tundra
there
came
two
other
horses
distorted
and
unreal
on
one
a
girl
on
the
other
a
figure
of
pain
and
tragedy
a
grotesque
creature
that
swayed
stiffly
to
the
motion
of
its
steed
its
face
writhed
into
lines
of
suffering
its
hands
clutching
cantle
and
horn
it
was
as
though
fate
with
invisible
touch
were
setting
her
stage
for
the
last
act
of
this
play
assembling
the
principals
close
to
the
golden
sands
where
first
they
had
made
entrance
the
man
and
the
girl
came
face
to
face
with
the
judge
and
marshal
who
cried
out
upon
seeing
them
but
as
they
reined
in
out
from
the
stairs
beside
them
a
man
shot
amid
clatter
and
uproar
give
me
a
hand
quick
he
shouted
to
them
what
s
up
inquired
the
marshal
it
s
murder
mcnamara
and
glenister
he
dashed
back
up
the
steps
behind
voorhees
the
judge
following
while
muffled
cries
came
from
above
the
gambler
turned
towards
the
three
men
who
were
hurrying
from
the
beach
and
recognizing
wheaton
called
to
him
untie
my
feet
cut
the
ropes
quick
what
s
the
trouble
the
lawyer
asked
but
on
hearing
glenister
s
name
bounded
after
the
judge
leaving
one
of
his
companions
to
free
the
rider
they
could
hear
the
fight
now
and
all
crowded
towards
the
door
helen
with
her
brother
in
spite
of
his
warning
to
stay
behind
she
never
remembered
how
she
climbed
those
stairs
for
she
was
borne
along
by
that
hypnotic
power
which
drags
one
to
behold
a
catastrophe
in
spite
of
his
will
reaching
the
room
she
stood
appalled
for
the
group
she
had
joined
watched
two
raging
things
that
rushed
at
each
other
with
inhuman
cries
ragged
bleeding
fighting
on
a
carpet
of
débris
every
loose
and
breakable
thing
had
been
ground
to
splinters
as
though
by
iron
slugs
in
a
whirling
cylinder
to
this
day
from
dawson
to
the
straits
from
unga
to
the
arctics
men
tell
of
the
combat
wherever
they
foregather
at
flaring
or
in
dingy
and
although
some
scout
the
tale
there
are
others
who
saw
it
and
can
swear
to
its
truth
these
say
that
the
encounter
was
like
the
battle
of
bull
moose
in
the
rutting
season
though
more
terrible
averring
that
two
men
like
these
had
never
been
known
in
the
land
since
the
days
of
vitus
bering
and
his
crew
for
their
rancor
had
swollen
till
at
feel
of
each
other
s
flesh
they
ran
mad
and
felt
superhuman
strength
it
is
true
at
any
rate
that
neither
was
conscious
of
the
filling
room
nor
the
cries
of
the
crowd
even
when
the
marshal
forced
himself
through
the
wedged
door
and
fell
upon
the
nearest
which
was
glenister
he
came
at
an
instant
when
the
two
had
paused
at
arm
glaring
with
eyes
gasping
the
labored
breath
back
into
their
lungs
with
a
fling
of
his
long
arms
the
young
man
hurled
the
intruder
aside
so
violently
that
his
head
struck
the
iron
safe
and
he
collapsed
insensible
then
without
apparent
notice
of
the
interruption
the
fight
went
on
it
was
seen
during
this
respite
that
mcnamara
s
mouth
was
running
water
as
though
he
were
deathly
sick
while
every
retch
brought
forth
a
groan
helen
heard
herself
crying
stop
them
stop
them
but
no
one
seemed
capable
of
interference
she
heard
her
brother
muttering
and
his
breath
coming
heavily
like
that
of
the
fighters
his
body
swaying
in
time
to
theirs
the
judge
was
ashy
imbecile
helpless
mcnamara
s
distress
was
patent
to
his
antagonist
who
advanced
upon
him
with
the
hunger
of
promised
victory
but
the
young
man
s
muscles
obeyed
his
commands
sluggishly
his
ribs
seemed
broken
his
back
was
weak
and
on
the
inner
side
of
his
legs
the
flesh
was
quivering
as
they
came
together
the
boss
reached
up
his
right
hand
and
caught
the
miner
by
the
face
burying
thumb
and
fingers
crablike
into
his
cheeks
forcing
his
slack
jaws
apart
thrusting
his
head
backward
while
he
centred
every
ounce
of
his
strength
in
the
effort
to
maim
roy
felt
the
flesh
giving
way
and
flung
himself
backward
to
break
the
hold
whereupon
the
other
summoned
his
wasting
energy
and
plunged
towards
the
safe
where
lay
the
revolver
instinct
warned
glenister
of
treachery
told
him
that
the
man
had
sought
this
last
resource
to
save
himself
and
as
he
saw
him
turn
his
back
and
reach
for
the
weapon
the
youth
leaped
like
a
panther
seizing
him
about
the
waist
grasping
mcnamara
s
wrist
with
his
right
hand
for
the
first
time
during
the
combat
they
were
not
face
to
face
and
on
the
instant
roy
realized
the
advantage
given
him
through
the
other
s
perfidy
realized
the
wrestler
s
hold
that
was
his
and
knew
that
the
moment
of
victory
was
come
the
telling
takes
much
time
but
so
quickly
had
these
things
happened
that
the
footsteps
of
the
soldiers
had
not
yet
reached
the
door
when
the
men
were
locked
beside
the
safe
of
what
happened
next
many
garbled
accounts
have
gone
forth
for
of
all
those
present
none
but
the
bronco
kid
knew
its
significance
and
ever
recounted
the
truth
concerning
it
some
claim
that
the
younger
man
was
seized
with
a
fear
of
death
which
multiplied
his
enormous
strength
others
that
the
power
died
in
his
adversary
as
reward
for
his
treason
but
it
was
not
so
no
sooner
had
roy
encompassed
mcnamara
s
waist
from
the
rear
than
he
slid
his
damaged
hand
up
past
the
other
s
chest
and
around
the
back
of
his
neck
thus
bringing
his
own
left
arm
close
under
his
enemy
s
left
armpit
wedging
the
receiver
s
head
forward
while
with
his
other
hand
he
grasped
the
politician
s
right
wrist
close
to
the
revolver
thus
holding
him
in
a
grasp
which
could
not
be
broken
now
came
the
test
the
two
bodies
set
themselves
rocklike
and
rigid
there
was
no
lunging
about
calling
up
the
final
atom
of
his
strength
glenister
bore
backward
with
his
right
arm
and
it
became
a
contest
for
the
weapon
which
clutched
in
the
two
hands
swayed
back
and
forth
or
darted
up
and
down
the
fury
of
resistance
causing
it
to
trace
formless
patterns
in
the
air
with
its
muzzle
mcnamara
shook
himself
but
he
was
close
against
the
safe
and
could
not
escape
his
head
bowed
forward
by
the
lock
of
the
miner
s
left
arm
and
so
he
strained
till
the
breath
clogged
in
his
throat
despite
the
grievous
toil
his
right
hand
moved
back
slightly
his
feet
shifted
a
bit
while
the
blood
seemed
bursting
from
his
eyes
but
he
found
that
the
long
fingers
encircling
his
wrist
were
like
gyves
weighted
with
the
strength
of
the
hills
and
the
irresistible
vigor
of
youth
which
knew
no
defeat
slowly
inch
by
inch
the
great
man
s
arm
was
dragged
back
down
past
his
side
while
the
strangling
labor
of
his
breath
showed
at
what
awful
cost
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
described
a
semicircle
and
the
knotted
hands
began
to
travel
towards
the
left
more
rapidly
now
across
his
broad
back
still
he
struggled
and
wrenched
but
uselessly
he
strove
to
fire
the
weapon
but
his
fingers
were
woven
about
it
so
that
the
hammer
would
not
work
then
the
miner
began
forcing
upward
the
white
skin
beneath
the
men
s
strips
of
clothing
was
stretched
over
great
knots
and
ridges
which
sunk
and
swelled
and
quivered
helen
watching
in
silent
terror
felt
her
brother
sinking
his
fingers
into
her
shoulder
and
heard
him
panting
his
face
ablaze
with
excitement
while
she
became
conscious
that
he
had
repeated
time
and
again
it
s
the
the
by
now
mcnamara
s
arm
was
bent
and
cramped
upon
his
back
and
then
they
saw
glenister
s
shoulder
dip
his
elbow
come
closer
to
his
side
and
his
body
heave
in
one
final
terrific
effort
as
though
pushing
a
heavy
weight
in
the
silence
something
snapped
like
a
stick
there
came
a
deafening
report
and
the
scream
of
a
strong
man
overcome
with
agony
mcnamara
went
to
his
knees
and
sagged
forward
on
to
his
face
as
though
every
bone
in
his
huge
bulk
had
turned
to
water
while
his
master
reeled
back
against
the
opposite
wall
his
heels
dragging
in
the
litter
bringing
up
with
outflung
arms
as
though
fearful
of
falling
swaying
blind
exhausted
his
face
blackened
by
the
explosion
of
the
revolver
yet
grim
with
the
light
of
victory
judge
stillman
shouted
hysterically
arrest
that
man
quick
don

let
him
go
it
was
the
miner
s
first
realization
that
others
were
there
raising
his
head
he
stared
at
the
faces
close
against
the
partition
then
groaned
the
words

beat
the
traitor
and
and
i
broke
him
with

hands
chapter

the
promise
of

soldiers
seized
the
young
man
who
made
no
offer
at
resistance
and
the
room
became
a
noisy
riot
crowds
surged
up
from
below
clamoring
questioning
till
some
one
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
shouted
down
they

a
murmur
arose
that
threatened
to
become

cheer

called

hang

mcnamara
reared
himself
groaning
from
the
floor
his
right
arm
swinging
from
the
shoulder
strangely
loose
and
distorted
with
palm
twisted
outward
while
his
battered
face
was
hideous
with
pain
and
defeat
he
growled
broken
maledictions
at
his
enemy
roy
meanwhile
said
nothing
for
as
the
savage
lust
died
in
him
he
realized
that
the
whirling
faces
before
him
were
the
faces
of
his
enemies
that
the
bronco
kid
was
still
at
large
and
that
his
vengeance
was
but
half
completed
his
knees
were
bending
his
limbs
were
like
leaden
bars
his
chest
a
furnace
of
coals
as
he
reeled
down
the
lane
of
human
forms
supported
by
his
guards
he
came
abreast
of
the
girl
and
her
companion
and
paused
clearing
his
vision
slowly
ah
there
you
are
he
said
thickly
to
the
gambler
and
began
to
wrestle
with
his
captors
baring
his
teeth
in
a
grimace
of
painful
effort
but
they
held
him
as
easily
as
though
he
were
a
child
and
drew
him
forward
his
body
sagging
limply
his
face
turned
back
over
his
shoulder
they
had
him
near
the
door
when
wheaton
barred
their
way
crying
hold
up
a
minute
it
s
all
right

we
did
our
best
but
we
were
done
by
a
damned
blackguard
now
he
ll
send
me
up
but
i
don
t
care
i
broke
him
with
my
naked
hands
didn
t
i
mcnamara
he
mocked
unsteadily
at
the
boss
who
cursed
aloud
in
return
glowering
like
an
evil
mask
while
stillman
ran
up
dishevelled
and
shrilly
irascible
take
him
away
i
tell
you
take
him
to
but
wheaton
held
his
place
while
the
room
centred
its
eyes
upon
him
scenting
some
unexpected
dénouement
he
saw
it
and
in
concession
to
a
natural
vanity
and
dramatic
instinct
he
threw
back
his
head
and
stuffed
his
hands
into
his
while
the
crowd
waited
he
grinned
insolently
at
the
judge
and
the
receiver
this
will
be
a
day
of
defeats
and
disappointments
to
you
my
friends
that
boy
won
t
go
to
jail
because
you
will
wear
the
shackles
yourselves
oh
you
played
a
shrewd
game
you
two
with
your
senators
your
politics
and
your
pulls
but
it
s
our
turn
now
and
we
ll
make
you
dance
for
the
mines
you
gutted
and
the
robberies
you
ve
done
and
the
men
you
ve
ruined
thank
heaven
there
s
honest
court
and
i
happened
to
find
he
turned
to
the
strangers
who
had
accompanied
him
from
the
ship
crying
serve
those
warrants
and
they
stepped
forward
the
uproar
of
the
past
few
minutes
had
brought
men
running
from
every
direction
till
finding
no
room
on
the
stairs
they
had
massed
in
the
street
below
while
the
word
flew
from
lip
to
lip
concerning
this
closing
scene
of
their
drama
the
battle
at
the
midas
the
great
fight
and
the
arrest
by
the
frisco
deputies
like
sindbad
s
genie
a
wondrous
tale
took
shape
from
the
rumors
men
shouldered
one
another
eagerly
for
a
glimpse
of
the
actors
and
when
the
press
streamed
out
greeted
it
with
volleys
of
questions
they
saw
the
unconscious
marshal
borne
forth
followed
by
the
old
judge
now
a
palsied
wretch
slinking
beside
his
captor
a
very
shell
of
a
man
at
whom
they
jeered
when
mcnamara
lurched
into
view
an
image
of
defeat
and
chagrin
their
voices
rose
menacingly
the
pack
was
turning
and
he
knew
it
but
though
racked
and
crippled
he
bent
upon
them
a
visage
so
full
of
defiance
and
contemptuous
malignity
that
they
hushed
themselves
and
their
final
picture
of
him
was
that
of
a
big
man
downed
but
unbeaten
to
the
last
they
began
to
cry
for
glenister
so
that
when
he
loomed
in
the
doorway
a
ragged
heroic
figure
his
heavy
shock
low
over
his
eyes
his
unshaven
face
aggressive
even
in
its
weariness
his
corded
arms
and
chest
bare
beneath
the
fluttering
streamers
the
street
broke
into
wild
cheering
here
was
a
man
of
their
own
a
son
of
the
northland
who
labored
and
loved
and
fought
in
a
way
they
understood
and
he
had
come
into
his
due
but
roy
dumb
and
listless
staggered
up
the
street
refusing
the
help
of
every
man
except
wheaton
he
heard
his
companion
talking
but
grasped
only
that
the
attorney
gloated
and
gloried
we
have
whipped
them
boy
we
have
whipped
them
at
their
own
game
arrested
in
their
very
cited
for
contempt
of
court
that
s
what
they
are
they
disobeyed
those
other
writs
and
so
i
got
i
broke
his
arm
muttered
the
miner
yes
i
saw
you
do
it
ugh
it
was
an
awful
thing
i
couldn
t
prove
conspiracy
but
they
ll
go
to
jail
for
a
little
while
just
the
same
and
we
have
broken
the
it
snapped
at
the
shoulder
the
other
continued
dully
just
like
a
shovel
handle
i
felt
it
but
he
tried
to
kill
me

he
sank
upon
the
bed
with
its
tangle
of
blankets
and
was
unconscious
before
the
lawyer
had
covered
him
over
there
he
lay
like
a
dead
man
till
late
in
the
afternoon
when
dextry
and
slapjack
came
in
from
the
hills
answering
wheaton
s
call
and
fell
upon
him
hungrily
they
shook
roy
into
consciousness
with
joyous
riot
pommelling
him
with
affectionate
roughness
till
he
rose
and
joined
with
them
stiffly
he
bathed
and
rubbed
the
soreness
from
his
muscles
emerging
physically
fit
they
made
him
recount
his
adventures
to
the
tiniest
detail
following
his
description
of
the
fight
with
absorbed
interest

dextry
broke
into
mournful
complaint

my
half
of
the

to

d
have
screeched
with

vindictively
i

continued
they
tell
me
that
when
he
was
arrested
he
swore
in
eighteen
different
languages
each
one
more

ly
repulsive
an
vig
rous
than
the
precedin
oh
i
have
sure
missed
partic

because
my
own
diction
is
gettin
run
down
an
of
late
showin
sad
lack
of
new
idees
which
i
might
have
assim
lated
somethin
robustly
original
an
expressive
if
i
d
been
here
no
sir
a
full
of
nuggets
wouldn
t
have
kept
me
how
did
it
sound
when
she
busted
insisted
the
morbid
simms
but
glenister
refused
to
discuss
his
combat
come
on
slap
said
the
old
prospector
let
s
go
i
m
so
het
up
i
can
t
set
still
an
besides
mebbe
we
can
get
the
story
the
way
it
really
happened
from
somebody
who
ain
t
bound
an
gagged
an
chloroformed
by
such
unbecomin
modesties
roy
don
t
never
go
into
vawdyville
with
them
personal
episodes
because
they
read
about
as
thrillin
as
a
why
say
i
ve
had
the
story
of
that
fight
from
four
different
fellers
already
none
of
which
was
within
four
blocks
of
the
scrimmage
an
they
re
all
diff
rent
an
all
better
n
your
now
that
glenister
s
mind
had
recovered
some
of
its
poise
he
realized
what
he
had
done
i
was
a
beast
an
animal
he
groaned
and
that
after
all
my
striving
i
wanted
to
leave
that
part
behind
i
wanted
to
be
worthy
of
her
love
and
trust
even
though
i
never
won
it
but
at
the
first
test
i
am
found
lacking
i
have
lost
her
confidence
yes
and
what
is
worse
infinitely
worse
i
have
lost
my
own
she
s
always
seen
me
at
my
worst
he
went
on
but
i
m
not
that
kind
at
bottom
not
that
kind
i
want
to
do
what
s
right
and
if
i
have
another
chance
i
will
i
i
will
i
ve
been
tried
too
hard
that
s
some
one
knocked
and
he
opened
the
door
to
admit
the
bronco
kid
and
helen
wait
a
minute
old
man
said
the
kid
i
m
here
as
a
the
gambler
handled
himself
with
difficulty
offering
in
explanation
i
m
all
sewed
up
in
bandages
of
one
kind
or
he
ought
to
be
in
bed
now
but
he
wouldn
t
let
me
come
alone
and
i
could
not
wait
the
girl
supplemented
while
her
eyes
avoided
glenister
s
in
strange
hesitation
he
wouldn
t
you
i
don
t
i
m
her
brother
announced
the
bronco
kid
i
ve
known
it
for
a
long
time
but
i
i
well
you
understand
i
couldn
t
let
her
know
all
i
can
say
is
i
ve
gambled
square
till
the
night
i
played
you
and
i
was
as
mad
as
a
dervish
then
blaming
you
for
the
talk
i
d
heard
last
night
i
learned
by
chance
about
struve
and
helen
and
got
to
the
in
time
to
save
her
i
m
sorry
i
didn
t
kill
his
long
white
fingers
writhed
about
the
arm
of
his
chair
at
the
memory
isn
t
he
dead
glenister
inquired
no
the
doctors
have
brought
him
in
and
he
ll
get
well
he
s
like
half
the
men
in
alaska
here
because
the
sheriffs
back
home
couldn
t
shoot
straight
there
s
something
else
i
m
not
a
good
talker
but
give
me
time
and
i
ll
manage
it
so
you
ll
understand
i
tried
to
keep
helen
from
coming
on
this
errand
but
she
said
it
was
the
square
thing
and
she
knows
better
than
it
s
about
those
papers
she
brought
in
last
spring
she
was
afraid
you
might
consider
her
a
party
to
the
deal
but
you
don
t
do
you
he
glared
belligerently
and
roy
replied
with
fervor
certainly
not
go
well
she
learned
the
other
day
that
those
documents
told
the
whole
story
and
contained
enough
proof
to
break
up
this
conspiracy
and
convict
the
judge
and
mcnamara
and
all
the
rest
but
struve
kept
the
bundle
in
his
safe
and
wouldn
t
give
it
up
without
a
price
that
s
why
she
went
away
with
him
she
thought
it
was
right
and
that
s
all
but
it
seems
wheaton
had
succeeded
in
another
way
now
i
m
coming
to
the
point
the
judge
and
mcnamara
are
arrested
for
contempt
of
court
and
they
re
as
good
as
convicted
you
have
recovered
your
mine
and
these
men
are
disgraced
they
will
go
to
jail
yes
for
six
months
perhaps
broke
in
the
other
hotly
but
what
does
that
amount
to
there
never
was
a
bolder
crime
consummated
nor
one
more
cruelly
unjust
they
robbed
a
realm
and
pillaged
its
people
they
defiled
a
court
and
made
justice
a
wanton
they
jailed
good
men
and
sent
others
to
ruin
and
for
this
they
are
to
suffer
how
by
a
paltry
fine
or
a
short
imprisonment
perhaps
by
an
ephemeral
disgrace
and
the
loss
of
their
stolen
goods
contempt
of
court
is
the
accusation
but
you
might
as
well
convict
a
murderer
for
breach
of
the
peace
we
ve
thrown
them
off
it
s
true
and
they
won
t
trouble
us
again
but
they
ll
never
have
to
answer
for
their
real
infamy
that
will
go
unpunished
while
their
lawyers
quibble
over
technicalities
and
rules
of
court
i
guess
it
s
true
that
there
isn
t
any
law
of
god
or
man
north
of
but
if
there
is
justice
south
of
that
mark
those
people
will
answer
for
conspiracy
and
go
to
the
you
make
it
hard
for
me
to
say
what
i
want
to
i
am
almost
sorry
we
came
for
i
am
not
cunning
with
words
and
i
don
t
know
that
you
ll
understand
said
the
bronco
kid
gravely
we
looked
at
it
this
way
you
have
had
your
victory
you
have
beaten
your
enemies
against
odds
you
have
recovered
your
mine
and
they
are
disgraced
to
men
like
them
that
last
will
outlive
and
outweigh
all
the
rest
but
the
judge
is
our
uncle
and
our
blood
runs
in
his
veins
he
took
helen
when
she
was
a
baby
and
was
a
father
to
her
in
his
selfish
way
loving
her
as
best
he
knew
how
and
she
loves
i
don
t
quite
understand
you
said
roy
and
then
helen
spoke
for
the
first
time
eagerly
taking
a
packet
from
her
bosom
as
she
began
this
will
tell
the
whole
wretched
story
glenister
and
show
the
plot
in
all
its
vileness
it
s
hard
for
me
to
betray
my
uncle
but
this
proof
is
yours
by
right
to
use
as
you
see
fit
and
i
can
t
keep
do
you
mean
that
this
evidence
will
show
all
that
and
you
re
going
to
give
it
to
me
because
you
think
it
is
your
duty
it
belongs
to
you
i
have
no
choice
but
what
i
came
for
was
to
plead
and
to
ask
a
little
mercy
for
my
uncle
who
is
an
old
old
man
and
very
weak
this
will
kill
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
swimming
while
the
little
chin
quivered
ever
so
slightly
and
her
pale
cheeks
were
flushed
there
rose
in
him
the
old
wild
desire
to
take
her
in
his
arms
a
yearning
to
pillow
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
kiss
away
the
tears
to
smooth
with
tender
caress
the
wavy
hair
and
bury
his
face
deep
in
it
till
he
grew
drunk
with
the
madness
of
her
but
he
knew
at
last
for
whom
she
really
pleaded
so
he
was
to
forswear
this
vengeance
which
was
no
vengeance
after
all
but
in
verity
a
just
punishment
they
asked
him
a
man
a
man
s
man
a
northman
to
do
this
and
for
what
for
no
reward
but
on
the
contrary
to
insure
himself
lasting
bitterness
he
strove
to
look
at
the
proposition
calmly
clearly
but
it
was
difficult
if
only
by
freeing
this
other
villain
as
well
as
her
uncle
he
would
do
a
good
to
her
then
he
would
not
hesitate
love
was
not
the
only
thing
he
marvelled
at
his
own
attitude
this
could
not
be
his
old
self
debating
thus
he
had
asked
for
another
chance
to
show
that
he
was
not
the
old
roy
glenister
well
it
had
come
and
he
was
ready
roy
dared
not
look
at
helen
any
more
for
this
was
the
hardest
moment
he
had
ever
lived
you
ask
this
for
your
uncle
but
what
of
of
the
other
fellow
you
must
know
that
if
one
goes
free
so
will
they
both
they
can
t
be
it
s
almost
too
much
to
ask
the
kid
took
up
uncertainly
but
don
t
you
think
the
work
is
done
i
can
t
help
but
admire
mcnamara
and
neither
can
you
he
s
been
too
good
an
enemy
to
you
for
that
and
and
he
loves
i
know
i
know
said
glenister
hastily
at
the
same
time
stopping
an
unintelligible
protest
from
the
girl
you
ve
said
he
straightened
his
slightly
stooping
shoulders
and
looked
at
the
unopened
package
wearily
then
slipped
the
rubber
band
from
it
and
separating
the
contents
tore
them
up
one
by
one
tore
them
into
fine
bits
without
hurry
or
ostentation
and
tossed
the
fragments
away
while
the
woman
began
to
sob
softly
the
sound
of
her
relief
alone
disturbing
the
silence
and
so
he
gave
her
his
enemy
making
his
offer
gamely
according
to
his
code
you
re
right
the
work
is
done
and
now
i
m
very
they
left
him
standing
there
the
glory
of
the
dying
day
illumining
his
lean
brown
features
the
vision
of
a
great
loneliness
in
his
weary
eyes
he
did
not
rouse
himself
till
the
sky
before
him
was
only
a
curtain
of
steel
pencilled
with
streaks
of
soot
that
lay
close
down
above
the
darker
sea
then
he
sighed
and
said
aloud
so
this
is
the
end
and
i
gave
him
to
her
with
these
hands
he
held
them
out
before
him
curiously
becoming
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
the
left
one
was
swollen
and
discolored
and
fearfully
painful
he
noted
it
with
impersonal
interest
realizing
its
need
of
medical
attention
so
left
the
cabin
and
walked
down
into
the
city
he
encountered
dextry
and
simms
on
the
way
and
they
went
with
him
both
flowing
with
the
gossip
of
the
camp
lord
but
you
re
the
talk
of
the
town
they
began
the
curio
hunters
have
commenced
to
pull
struve
s
office
apart
for
souvenirs
and
the
swedes
want
to
run
you
for
congress
as
soon
as
ever
we
get
admitted
as
a
state
they
say
that
at
holts
you
could
lick
any
of
them
eastern
senators
and
thereby
rastle
out
a
lot
of
good
legislation
for
us
cripples
up
speakin
of
laws
goes
to
show
me
that
this
here
country
is
gettin
too
blamed
civilized
for
a
white
man
said
simms
pessimistically
and
now
that
this
fight
is
ended
up
it
don
t
look
like
there
would
be
anything
doin
fit
to
claim
the
interest
of
a
person
for
a
long
while
i
m
goin
west
why
you
can
throw
a
stone
into
bering
strait
from
here
said
roy
smiling
oh
well
the
world
s
round
there
s
a
schooner
outfittin
for
sibeery
two
years
cruise
me
an
dex
is
figgerin
on
gettin
out
towards
the
frontier
fer
a
sure
said
dextry
i
m
beginnin
to
feel
all
cramped
up
hereabouts
owin
to
these
fillymonarch
orchestras
an
french
restarawnts
and
such
discrepancies
of
scenery
they
re
puttin
a
pavement
on
front
street
and
there
s
a
parlor
opened
up
why
i
d
like
to
get
where
i
could
stretch
an
holler
without
disturbin
the
pensiveness
of
some
dude
in
a
dress
suit
better
come
along
roy
we
can
sell
out
the
i
ll
think
it
over
said
the
young
man
the
night
was
bright
with
a
full
moon
when
they
left
the
doctor
s
office
roy
in
no
mood
for
the
exuberance
of
his
companions
parted
from
them
but
had
not
gone
far
before
he
met
cherry
malotte
his
head
was
low
and
he
did
not
see
her
till
she
spoke
well
boy
so
it
s
over
at
last
her
words
chimed
so
perfectly
with
his
thoughts
that
he
replied
yes
it
s
all
over
little
you
don
t
need
my
congratulations
you
know
me
too
well
for
that
how
does
it
feel
to
be
a
winner
i
don
t
know
i
ve
lost
what
everything
except
the
everything
except
i
see
you
mean
that
she
that
you
have
asked
her
and
she
won
t
he
never
knew
the
cost
at
which
she
held
her
voice
so
steady
more
than
that
it
s
so
new
that
it
hurts
yet
and
it
will
continue
to
hurt
for
a
long
time
i
suppose
but
i
am
going
back
to
my
hills
and
my
valleys
back
to
the
midas
and
my
work
and
try
to
begin
all
over
for
a
time
i
ve
wandered
in
strange
paths
seeking
new
gods
as
it
were
but
the
dazzle
has
died
out
of
my
eyes
and
i
can
see
true
again
she
isn
t
for
me
although
i
shall
always
love
her
i
m
sorry
i
can
t
forget
easily
as
some
do
it
s
hard
to
look
ahead
and
take
an
interest
in
things
but
what
about
you
where
shall
you
go
i
don
t
know
it
doesn
t
really
matter
the
dusk
hid
her
white
set
face
and
she
spoke
monotonously
i
am
going
to
see
the
bronco
kid
he
sent
for
me
he
s
he
s
not
a
bad
sort
said
roy
and
i
suppose
he
ll
make
a
new
start
perhaps
said
she
gazing
far
out
over
the
gloomy
ocean
it
all
after
a
moment
she
added
what
a
pity
that
we
can
t
all
sponge
off
the
slate
and
begin
afresh
and
it
s
part
of
the
game
said
he
i
don
t
know
why
it
s
so
but
it
is
i
ll
see
you
sometimes
won
t
i
no
boy
i
think
i
believe
i
understand
he
murmured
and
perhaps
it
s
better
he
took
her
two
soft
hands
in
his
one
good
right
and
kissed
them
god
bless
you
and
keep
you
dear
brave
little
she
stood
straight
and
still
as
he
melted
into
the
shadows
and
only
the
moonlight
heard
her
pitiful
sob
and
her
hopeless
whisper
my
boy
my
he
wandered
down
beside
the
sea
for
his
battle
was
not
yet
won
and
until
he
was
surer
of
himself
he
could
not
endure
the
ribaldry
and
rejoicing
of
his
fellows
a
welcome
lay
waiting
for
him
in
every
public
place
but
no
one
there
could
know
the
mockery
of
it
no
one
could
gauge
the
desolation
that
was
his
the
sand
wet
packed
and
hard
as
a
pavement
gave
no
sound
to
his
careless
steps
and
thus
it
was
that
he
came
silently
upon
the
one
woman
as
she
stood
beside
the
silver
surf
had
he
seen
her
first
he
would
have
slunk
past
in
the
landward
shadows
but
recognizing
his
tall
form
she
called
and
he
came
while
it
seemed
that
his
lungs
grew
suddenly
constricted
as
though
bound
about
with
steel
hoops
the
very
pleasure
of
her
sight
pained
him
he
advanced
eagerly
and
yet
with
hesitation
standing
stiffly
aloof
while
his
heart
fluttered
and
his
tongue
grew
dumb
at
last
she
saw
his
bandages
and
her
manner
changed
abruptly
coming
closer
she
touched
them
with
caressing
fingers
it
s
nothing
nothing
at
all
he
said
while
his
voice
jumped
out
of
all
control
when
are
you
going
away
i
do
not
know
not
for
some
he
had
supposed
she
would
go
with
her
uncle
and
the
other
to
be
with
them
through
their
travail
with
warm
impetuosity
she
began
it
was
a
noble
thing
you
did
oh
i
am
glad
and
i
prefer
you
to
think
of
me
in
that
way
rather
than
as
the
wild
beast
you
saw
this
morning
for
i
was
mad
perfectly
mad
with
hatred
and
revenge
and
every
wild
impulse
that
comes
to
a
defeated
man
you
see
i
had
played
and
lost
played
and
lost
again
and
again
till
there
was
nothing
left
what
mischance
brought
you
there
it
was
a
terribly
brutal
thing
but
you
can
t
but
i
understand
i
do
i
know
all
about
it
now
i
know
the
wild
rage
of
desperation
i
know
the
exultation
of
victory
i
know
what
hate
and
fear
are
now
you
told
me
once
that
the
wilderness
had
made
you
a
savage
and
i
laughed
at
it
just
as
i
did
when
you
said
that
my
contact
with
big
things
would
teach
me
the
truth
that
we
re
all
alike
and
that
those
motives
are
in
us
all
i
see
now
that
you
were
right
and
i
was
very
simple
i
learned
a
great
deal
last
i
have
learned
much
also
said
he
i
wish
you
might
teach
me
i
i
don
t
think
i
could
teach
you
any
more
she
hesitated
he
moved
as
though
to
speak
but
held
back
and
tore
his
eyes
away
from
her
well
she
inquired
gazing
at
him
covertly
once
a
long
time
ago
i
read
a
lover
s
petition
and
ever
since
knowing
you
i
have
made
the
constant
prayer
that
i
might
be
given
the
purity
to
be
worthy
the
good
in
you
and
that
you
might
be
granted
the
patience
to
reach
the
good
in
me
but
it
s
no
use
but
at
least
i
m
glad
we
have
met
on
common
ground
as
it
were
and
that
you
understand
in
a
measure
the
prayer
could
not
be
answered
but
through
it
i
have
found
myself
and
i
have
known
you
that
last
is
worth
more
than
a
king
s
ransom
to
me
it
is
a
holy
thing
which
i
shall
reverence
always
and
when
you
go
you
will
leave
me
lonely
except
for
its
but
i
am
not
going
she
said
that
is
unless
something
in
her
voice
swept
his
gaze
back
from
the
shimmering
causeway
that
rippled
seaward
to
the
rising
moon
it
brought
the
breath
into
his
throat
and
he
shook
as
though
seized
by
a
great
fear
unless
what
unless
you
want
me
oh
god
don
t
play
with
me
he
flung
out
his
hand
as
though
to
stop
her
while
his
voice
died
out
to
a
supplicating
hoarseness
i
can
t
stand
don
t
you
see
won
t
you
see
she
asked
i
was
waiting
here
for
the
courage
to
go
to
you
since
you
have
made
it
so
very
hard
for
me
my
with
which
she
came
close
to
him
looking
upward
into
his
face
smiling
a
little
shrinking
a
little
yielding
yet
withholding
while
the
moonlight
made
of
her
eyes
two
bottomless
boundless
pools
dark
with
love
and
brimming
with
the
promise
of
his
dreams
