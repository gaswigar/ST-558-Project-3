that

it
seems
a

the
facts
and
incidents
connected
with
the

conflict
of
the

of
the
eleven

who
took

herein
narrated

four
now
survive
before
the
hastening
years
shall
have
partially
obliterated
many
circumstances
from
my

and
while
there
is
still
an
opportunity
for
conference
and

criticism
i
desire
to
make
from
letters

and
documents
in
my
possession
a
statement
which
will
embody
my
own
recollections
of
the
turbulent
days
of
and
i
am
aware
that
later
and
more
absorbing
events
have
caused
the
earlier
struggles
of
the
war
to
recede
in
the
distance
but
those
who
were
in
active
life
at
that
time
will
not
soon
forget
the
thrill
of
emotion
and
sympathy
which
followed
the
movements
of
anderson

it
became
its

is
to

without

the

of

charleston
at
this
period
was
far
from
being
a
pleasant
place
for
a
loyal
man
almost
every
public
assemblage
was
tinctured
with
treasonable
sentiments
and
toasts
against
the
flag
were
always
warmly
applauded
as
early
as
july
there
was
much
talk
of
secession
accompanied
with
constant
drilling
and
threats
of
taking
the
forts
as
soon
as
a
separation
should
occur
to
the
south
carolinians
fort
moultrie
was
almost
a
sacred
spot
endeared
by
many
precious
historical
associations
for
the
ancestors
of
most
of
the
principal
families
had
fought
there
in
the
revolutionary
war
behind
their
hastily
improvised
ramparts
of
palmetto
logs
and
had
gained
a
glorious
victory
over
the
british
fleet
in
its
first
attempt
to
enter
the
harbor
and
capture
the
city
the
modern
fort
had
been
built
nearly
on
the
site
of
the
ancient
one
its
walls
were
but
twelve
feet
high
they
were
old
weak
and
so
full
of
cracks
that
it
was
quite
common
to
see
soldiers
climb
to
the
top
by
means
of
the
support
these
crevices
afforded
to
their
hands
and
feet
the
constant
action
of
the
had
drifted
one
immense
heap
of
sand
against
the
of
the
work
and
another
in
the
immediate
vicinity
these
dominated
the
parapet
and
made
the
fort
untenable
indeed
it
was
originally
built
by
the
engineers
as
a
mere
with
just
sufficient
strength
to
prevent
it
from
being
taken
by
a
de
as
an
overpowering
force
of
militia
could
always
be
summoned
for
its
defense
it
was
supposed
that
no
foreign
army
would
ever
attempt
to
besiege
it
the
contingency
that
the
people
of
charleston
themselves
might
attack
a
fort
intended
for
their
own
protection
had
never
been
anticipated
our
force
was
pitifully
small
even
for
a
time
of
peace
and
for
mere
police
purposes
it
consisted
of
enlisted
men
and
seven
officers
together
with
thirteen
musicians
of
the
regimental
band
whereas
the
work
called
for
a
war
garrison
of
three
hundred
men
the
first
indication
of
actual
danger
came
from
richmond
virginia
in
the
shape
of
urgent
inquiries
as
to
the
strength
of
our
defenses
and
the
number
of
available
troops
in
the
harbor
these
questions
were
put
by
a
resident
of
that
city
named
edmund
ruffin
an
old
man
whose
later
years
had
been
devoted
to
the
formation
of
disunion
lodges
and
who
became
subsequently
noted
for
firing
the
first
gun
at
fort
sumter
his
love
of
slavery
amounted
to
fanaticism
when
the
cause
of
the
rebellion
became
hopeless
he
refused
to
survive
it
and
committed
suicide
in
the
beginning
of
july
robert
barnwell
rhett
and
other
ultra
men
in
charleston
made
violent
speeches
to
the
mob
urging
them
to
drive
every
united
states
official
out
of
the
state
but
as
many
influential
secessionists
were
enjoying
the
sweets
of
federal
patronage
under
buchanan
we
did
not
anticipate
any
immediate
disturbance
to
influence
his
hearers
still
more
rhett
did
not
hesitate
to
state
that
hamlin
was
a
mulatto
and
he
asked
if
they
intended
to
submit
to
a
negro
it
is
an
interesting
question
to
know
how
far
at
this
period
the
secretary
of
war
himself
was
loyal
dawson
the
able
editor
of
the
is
of
opinion
after
a
careful
investigation
of
the
facts
that
floyd
at
this
time
was
true
to
the
union
and
that
he
remained
so
until
december
when
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
been
advancing
large
sums
of
money
from
the
treasury
to
contractors
to
pay
for
work
which
had
never
been
commenced
to
make
the
loss
good
nearly
a
million
of
dollars
was
taken
from
the
indian
trust
fund
finding
he
would
be
dismissed
from
the
cabinet
for
his
complicity
in
these
transactions
and
would
also
be
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
of
the
district
of
columbia
he
made
a
furious
secession
speech
sent
in
his
resignation
and
suddenly
left
for
the
south
dawson
founds
his
opinion
in
this
case
upon
the
statement
of
fitz
john
porter
who
was
a
major
on
duty
in
the
war
department
at
the
time
and
therefore
apparently
well
qualified
to
judge
floyd
actions
toward
us
however
were
not
those
of
a
true
man
and
i
am
of
opinion
that
his
loyalty
was
merely
assumed
for
the
occasion
he
sent
seventeen
thousand
muskets
to
south
carolina
when
he
knew
that
charleston
was
a
of
sedition
and
that
in
all
probability
the
arms
would
be
used
against
the
united
states
greeley
says
in
his
american
conflict
that
during
these
turbulent
times
floyd
disarmed
the
government
by
forwarding
one
hundred
and
fifteen
thousand
muskets
in
all
to
the
southern
confederacy
in
addition
to
this
he
sold
large
quantities
of
arms
to
lamar
of
savannah
and
other
secessionists
in
the
south
on
the
plea
that
the
muskets
thus
disposed
of
did
not
conform
to
the
latest
army
model
just
before
his
resignation
he
continued
the
same
policy
by
directing
that
one
hundred
and
heavy
guns
should
be
shipped
from
pittsburg
pennsylvania
to
ship
island
mississippi
where
there
was
no
garrison
and
to
galveston
texas
yet
this
was
the
official
upon
whom
we
were
to
rely
for
advice
and
protection
this
was
the
wolf
who
was
to
guard
the
fold
our
commander
colonel
gardner
had
done
good
service
in
the
war
of
and
in
mexico
but
now
owing
to
his
advanced
age
was
ill
fitted
to
weather
the
storm
that
was
about
to
burst
upon
us
in
politics
he
was
quite
southern
frequently
asserting
that
the
south
had
been
treated
outrageously
in
the
question
of
the
territories
and
defrauded
of
her
just
rights
in
other
respects
he
acquiesced
however
in
the
necessity
of
defending
the
fort
should
it
be
attacked
but
as
he
lived
with
his
family
outside
of
the
walls
he
could
not
take
a
very
active
part
himself
indeed
on
one
occasion
when
a
secession
meeting
was
held
in
our
immediate
vicinity
accompanied
with
many
threats
and
noisy
demonstrations
he
sent
word
to
me
to
assume
command
at
once
in
his
place
he
now
found
himself
in
a
peculiar
position
the
populace
were
becoming
excited
and
there
was
every
probability
that
a
collision
accidental
or
otherwise
might
occur
at
any
moment
between
the
troops
and
the
mob
outside
if
not
between
the
troops
and
the
state
militia
the
dilemma
which
confronted
him
was
either
to
make
a
disgraceful
surrender
of
his
command
or
take
the
other
alternative
and
fight
south
carolina
without
the
aid
or
of
the
general
government
he
thought
the
difficulty
might
perhaps
be
solved
by
removing
the
garrison
to
smithville
north
carolina
having
received
permission
to
do
so
in
case
the
yellow
fever
which
had
proved
so
disastrous
the
previous
year
should
break
out
again
strange
to
say
some
of
the
most
ultra
papers
in
the
southern
interest
in
new
york
and
charleston
ridiculed
the
proposed
movement
they
probably
feared
that
our
absence
might
deprive
the
conspirators
of
the
prestige
of
an
easy
victory
by
the
middle
of
august
the
country
people
began
to
be
quite
violent
in
their
language
and
made
many
threats
of
what
they
would
do
in
case
of
lincoln
election
while
the
rebellion
was
thus
drifting
onward
the
north
remained
quiescent
utterly
refusing
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
any
real
danger
yet
it
was
publicly
known
that
although
the
southern
states
had
refused
to
commit
themselves
to
secession
they
were
pledged
not
to
allow
south
carolina
to
be
coerced
and
this
practically
amounted
to
a
powerful
league
against
the
union
since
it
was
a
combination
to
prevent
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
which
bound
the
states
together
as
we
were
liable
to
be
attacked
at
any
moment
we
desired
to
get
rid
of
the
which
dominated
our
walls
to
this
end
we
applied
to
the
general
joseph
johnston
for
authority
to
hire
citizen
laborers
but
he
declined
to
accede
to
the
request
on
the
ground
that
the
work
did
not
properly
appertain
to
his
department
he
was
a
nephew
of
floyd
and
soon
went
over
to
the
enemy
with
the
exception
of
robert
lee
he
subsequently
became
the
most
noted
of
all
the
rebel
generals
we
were
gratified
about
the
of
september
at
seeing
some
signs
of
life
in
the
secretary
of
war
which
seemed
to
show
that
he
appreciated
our
dangers
and
difficulties
he
ordered
first
lieutenant
and
brevet
captain
john
foster
of
the
engineers
to
repair
to
fort
moultrie
and
put
that
and
the
other
defenses
of
charleston
harbor
in
perfect
order
the
reason
privately
assigned
for
this
was
that
we
were
drifting
into
complications
with
england
and
france
with
reference
to
mexico
for
one
i
gave
the
honorable
secretary
very
little
credit
for
this
proceeding
inasmuch
as
he
had
just
previous
to
this
forwarded
to
south
carolina
the
means
of
arming
and
equipping
seventeen
thousand
men
against
the
united
states
i
therefore
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
forts
were
to
be
made
ready
for
active
service
in
order
that
they
might
be
turned
over
in
that
condition
to
the
southern
league
two
young
lieutenants
of
engineers
snyder
and
meade
were
soon
after
sent
to
foster
as
assistants
and
here
it
may
be
well
to
speak
of
the
officers
of
our
command
as
they
were
at
that
period
the
record
of
their
services
afterward
during
the
rebellion
would
constitute
a
volume

itself

officers
were
good
and
there
was
no
dissipation
or
drunkenness
in
the
garrison
the
majority
of
the
men
too
were
old
soldiers
who
could
be
thoroughly
relied
upon
under
all
circumstances
there
was
also
one
civilian
with
us
edward
moale
who
was
clerk
and
to
captain
foster
his
services
were
subsequently
very
valuable
in
many
ways
fearing
that
in
the
course
of
events
our
correspondence
might
be
tampered
with
i
invented
a
cipher
which
afterward
proved
to
be
very
useful
it
enabled
me
to
communicate
through
my
brother
in
new
york
much
valuable
information
to
lincoln
at
springfield
preston
king
roscoe
conkling
and
other
leaders
of
public
opinion
in
relation
to
our
strength
and
resources
situated
as
we
were
we
naturally
desired
to
know
how
far
cabinet
was
willing
to
sustain
us
william
trescott
of
south
carolina
was
assistant
secretary
of
state
at
this
time
and
frequently
corresponded
with
his
brother
doctor
trescott
in
charleston
we
therefore
naturally
thought
the
views
of
the
latter
might
indirectly
reflect
those
of
the
administration
the
doctor
was
of
opinion
there
would
be
no
attempt
at
coercion
in
case
south
carolina
seceded
but
that
all
postal
and
telegraphic
communication
would
cease
and
a
be
placed
outside
to
collect
the
revenue
this
arrangement
would
leave
our
little
force
isolated
and
deserted
to
bear
the
brunt
of
whatever
might
occur
in
october
the
disunionists
became
more
bitter
but
they
were
not
disposed
to
be
aggressive
as
they
thought
buchanan
could
be
relied
upon
not
to
take
any
decisive
action
against
them
colonel
gardner
would
not
at
this
time
mount
the
guns
or
take
any
precautions
whatever
he
alleged
with
reason
that
the
work
was
all
torn
to
pieces
by
the
engineers
that
it
was
full
of
débris
and
that
under
the
circumstances
he
was
not
responsible
for
any
thing
that
might
happen
we
had
been
promised
a
considerable
number
of
recruits
but
they
were
kept
back
and
we
now
ascertained
that
none
would
be
sent
until
late
in
december
after
the
crisis
was
over
in
the
latter
part
of
the
month
i
became
quite
unpopular
in
charleston
partly
on
account
of
my
sentiments
but
more
especially
because
some
very
offensive
articles
written
from
that
city
had
appeared
in
the
northern
papers
and
were
attributed
to
me
it
seems
that
at
this
very
time
an
abolition
correspondent
of
the
york
was
employed
in
the
office
of
rhett
paper
the
this
man
professed
to
be
the
most
secessionist
of
them
all
in
conversation
with
me
afterward
he
claimed
to
be
the
author
of
the
articles
referred
to
in
truth
these
were
days
of
extraordinary
proscription
for
sake
i
heard
with
profound
indignation
of
the
case
of
a
poor
seamstress
from
new
york
who
had
been
sent
to
jail
in
charleston
simply
for
stating
that
she
did
not
believe
in
the
institution
of
slavery
on
appealing
to
the
then
mayor
of
new
york
fernando
wood
he
replied
that
he
was
rejoiced
she
was
in
prison
and
hoped
she
would
be
kept
there
toward
the
close
of
the
month
the
south
carolina
leaders
began
to
fear
that
the
other
southern
states
would
not
join
them
and
were
engaged
in
discussing
the
subject
of
a
french
protectorate
the
negroes
overheard
a
great
deal
that
was
said
by
their
masters
and
in
consequence
became
excited
and
troublesome
for
the
news
flew
like
among
them
that
massa
linkum
was
coming
to
set
them
all
free
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moneyed
men
in
charleston
began
to
cool
when
they
reflected
upon
the
enormous
expenses
involved
in
keeping
up
a
standing
army
in
an
agricultural
state
like
south
carolina
at
the
request
of
some
union
men
captain
seymour
made
a
startling
exhibit
showing
the
large
amount
required
to
maintain
even
a
moderate
force
it
had
a
good
effect
upon
the
merchants
and
indeed
if
the
other
southern
states
had
not
promptly
sustained
south
carolina
the
movement
must
have
soon
collapsed
from
its
inherent
weakness
although
the
secession
leaders
were
preparing
to
meet
coercion
if
it
should
come
i
will
do
them
the
justice
to
say
that
they
determined
to
commit
no
overt
act
against
the
union
so
long
as
the
state
formed
an
integral
part
of
it
they
soon
found
however
that
the
mob
did
not
recognize
these
fine
distinctions
it
was
easy
to
raise
the
storm
but
once
under
full
headway
it
was
difficult
to
govern
it
independent
companies
and
were
everywhere
forming
in
opposition
to
their
wishes
for
these
organizations
from
their
very
nature
were
quite
unmanageable
the
military
commanders
much
preferred
the
state
militia
because
they
could
control
it
by
law
a
gentleman
from
the
country
who
had
joined
the
came
in
one
day
to
the
charleston
hotel
with
a
huge
cockade
on
his
hat
expecting
to
be
received
with
great
applause
but
to
his
astonishment
he
was
greeted
with
laughter
and
ridicule
on
the
of
october
general
scott
wrote
his
celebrated
letter
to
the
president
recommending
that
strong
garrisons
be
placed
at
once
in
all
the
southern
forts
undoubtedly
this
was
good
advice
but
as
our
army
was
widely
scattered
all
over
the
west
to
protect
the
frontier
settlements
from
the
indians
only
five
small
companies
were
available
for
the
purpose
the
suggestion
therefore
had
but
little
practical
value
november
had
arrived
the
muttering
of
the
storm
was
heard
all
around
us
and
yet
not
one
word
of
counsel
or
encouragement
came
from
washington
colonel
gardner
began
to
feel
uneasy
at
this
studied
silence
and
determined
to
place
the
responsibility
of
any
disaster
that
might
occur
where
it
properly
belonged
on
the
of
the
month
he
made
a
full
report
to
his
next
superior
officer
general
wool
at
troy
new
york
to
be
forwarded
to
the
secretary
of
war
in
relation
to
the
dangers
that
threatened
us
and
our
imperfect
means
of
defense
he
notified
them
that
our
provisions
would
be
exhausted
by
the
of
the
month
and
that
we
were
very
deficient
in
ammunition
and
military
supplies
generally
the
secretary
in
his
answer
to
this
communication
simply
expressed
his
regret
that
he
had
not
been
informed
of
all
this
before
this
sympathy
was
no
doubt
very
gratifying
but
being
of
an
entirely
passive
nature
did
not
benefit
us
in
the
least
colonel
gardner
at
our
solicitation
directed
that
the
guns
which
had
been
dismounted
to
enable
the
engineers
to
make
their
repairs
be
remounted
at
once
and
seymour
company
and
mine
soon
placed
them
in
position
it
was
of
little
use
however
to
have
our
armament
in
readiness
unless
the
approaches
to
the
fort
could
be
carefully
watched
this
it
was
impossible
to
do
by
the
ordinary
system
of
guard
duty
but
i
suggested
a
plan
which
enabled
us
to
have
an
ample
number
of
sentinels
without
exhausting
the
men
it
was
done
by
placing
each
man
on
guard
for
a
single
hour
between
tattoo
and
reveille
allowing
him
to
sleep
for
the
remainder
of
the
night

in

is
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
ashley
river
it
looked
feasible
to
go
there
in
a
boat
without
attracting
attention
and
procure
a
full
supply
of
cartridges
and
other
articles
which
were
very
much
needed
captain
seymour
volunteered
for
the
service
and
was
sent
over
with
a
small
party
early
in
the
afternoon
notwithstanding
he
took
every
precaution
some
spy
belonging
to
a
vigilance
committee
followed
him
and
reported
the
facts
in
the
city
seymour
at
once
found
himself
beset
by
an
excited
mob
and
wholly
prevented
from
accomplishing
the
object
of
his
mission
colonel
gardner
wrote
to
mayor
macbeth
for
an
explanation
the
latter
apologized
politely
for
this
unexpected
occurrence
and
speaking
for
himself
and
other
city
officials
stated
that
so
long
as
they
staid
in
the
union
they
desired
to
remain
faithful
to
its
obligations
and
that
no
further
obstacles
would
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
another
expedition
colonel
gardner
however
did
not
send
out
again
thinking
perhaps
the
mob
might
be
beyond
the
control
of
the
mayor
since
his
arrival
captain
foster
had
been
hard
at
work
on
the
fort
he
had
hired
laborers
from
the
vicinity
of
charleston
and
had
sent
to
baltimore
for
a
large
number
of
masons
who
had
formerly
worked
for
him
in
spite
of
his
efforts
we
were
still
in
a
very
weak
condition
and
unable
to
defend
ourselves
it
is
true
the
sand
had
been
removed
from
the
of
the
work
but
as
that
front
had
no
flanking
defenses
the
angles
in
the
wall
were
torn
down
to
enable
the
engineers
to
construct
double
caponieres
there
this
left
great
gaps
through
which
an
assaulting
party
could
penetrate
at
any
moment
perhaps
in
one
sense
it
added
to
our
security
for
there
was
no
glory
to
be
acquired
in
capturing
a
fort
which
was
wide
open
and
defenseless
crowds
of
excited
countrymen
wearing
secession
cockades
constantly
came
to
visit
the
work
and
on
the
of
november
they
formed
in
procession
and
marched
around
it
but
did
not
offer
any
violence
it
may
not
be
improper
to
state
that
i
was
the
only
officer
of
the
command
who
favored
lincoln
election
as
regards
my
companions
however
there
was
no
difference
of
opinion
in
regard
to
sustaining
the
new
president
should
he
be
legally
elected
and
they
were
all
both
willing
and
anxious
to
defend
the
fort

their
honor

view
of
the
probable
success

the

governor
gist
called
the
south
carolina
legislature
together
to
meet
on
monday
the
of
november
in
his
message
he
recommended
the
immediate
formation
of
a
standing
army
of
ten
thousand
men
and
that
all
persons
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
be
armed
for
immediate
service
in
consequence
of
this
recommendation
by
the
of
november
the
whole
state
was
swarming
with
the
spark
came
at
last
which
was
to
set
fire
to
the
magazine
the
startling
news
of
lincoln
election
reached
charleston
on
the
of
november
as
this
event
was
sure
to
lead
to
secession
the
disunionists
were
wild
with
delight
in
their
exuberance
of
spirits
they
ran
through
the
streets
shouting
hurra
for
lincoln
the
united
states
district
court
which
was
in
session
at
once
broke
up
and
its
judge
magrath
sent
in
his
resignation
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
edmund
ruffin
who
has
already
been
referred
to
made
a
fiery
secession
speech
to
an
immense
audience
at
the
capitol
of
the
state
the
legislature
inflamed
by
public
sentiment
called
a
convention
to
meet
on
the
of
the
month
to
decide
the
question
of
secession
governor
joseph
brown
of
georgia
also
called
a
convention
there
for
the
same
purpose
and
the
excitement
in
each
state
constantly
reacted
on
the
other
in
the
early
part
of
november
one
hundred
and
fifty
masons
arrived
from
baltimore
to
work
on
the
forts
in
the
harbor
they
were
undoubtedly
good
workmen
but
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
they
were
not
also
good
unionists
captain
foster
at
this
time
did
not
believe
that
any
serious
complications
would
arise
from
the
attitude
south
carolina
had
assumed
and
did
not
therefore
think
it
necessary
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
politics
of
his
laborers
had
he
selected
zealous
union
men
their
arrival
would
have
been
a
most
opportune
for
the
garrison
unfortunately
most
of
them
sympathized
with
the
south
and
their
coming
was
rather
a
source
of
weakness
than
of
strength
so
far
as
actual
fighting
was
concerned
they
rendered
us
however
great
and
timely
assistance
by
their
labor
the
first
thing
that
attracted
the
eye
of
the
stranger
upon
approaching
charleston
from
the
sea
was
fort
sumter
it
was
built
on
an
artificial
island
made
of
large
blocks
of
stone
the
walls
were
of
dark
brick
and
designed
for
three
tiers
of
guns
the
whole
structure
as
it
rose
abruptly
out
of
the
water
had
a
gloomy
appearance
it
was
situated
on
the
edge
of
the
channel
in
the
narrowest
part
of
the
harbor
between
fort
moultrie
and
cummings
point
distant
about
a
mile
from
the
former
place
and
twelve
hundred
yards
from
the
latter
the
year
before
it
had
been
used
by
us
as
a
temporary
place
of
confinement
and
security
for
some
negroes
that
had
been
brought
over
from
africa
in
a
slaver
captured
by
one
of
our
naval
vessels
the
inevitable
conflict
was
very
near
breaking
out
at
that
time
for
there
was
an
eager
desire
on
the
part
of
all
the
people
around
us
to
seize
these
negroes
and
distribute
them
among
the
plantations
and
if
the
government
had
not
acted
promptly
in
sending
them
back
to
africa
i
think
an
attempt
would
have
been
made
to
take
them
from
us
by
force
on
the
ground
that
some
of
them
had
violated
a
state
law
by
landing
at
moultrieville
as
fort
sumter
has
considerable
historic
renown
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
to
relate
another
incident
connected
with
it
although
it
is
not
germane
to
my
narrative
in
after
the
negroes
were
taken
away
the
fort
remained
in
charge
of
an
who
lived
there
alone
with
his
wife
and
two
little
children
supplies
were
sent
to
him
regularly
but
in
case
of
emergency
he
could
only
communicate
with
the
shore
by
means
of
a
small
boat
one
wild
stormy
day
when
the
wind
was
blowing
a
gale
he
was
suddenly
struck
down
with
yellow
fever
his
wife
saw
that
if
he
did
not
have
immediate
medical
assistance
he
would
die
she
herself
could
not
go
as
he
required
constant
attention
and
the
children
were
too
young
to
be
of
any
service
a
day
passed
on
and
it
became
evident
that
he
was
growing
worse
in
a
frantic
state
of
mind
she
rushed
up
to
the
top
of
the
fort
waved
a
sheet
backward
and
forward
and
raised
and
lowered
the
garrison
flag
repeatedly
in
hopes
of
attracting
the
attention
of
some
passing
vessel
but
although
several
went
by
no
one
seemed
to
notice
the
signals
or
if
they
did
they
would
not
stop
on
account
of
the
tempest
which
still
continued
she
then
took
the
desperate
resolution
of
putting
her
two
little
children
in
the
small
boat
and
trusting
to
the
to
drift
them
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
charleston
she
placed
a
letter
in
the
hand
of
one
of
them
to
be
given
to
the
first
person
they
met
imploring
that
a
physician
might
be
sent
to
her
at
once
it
was
a
terrible
experiment
for
the
children
might
easily
have
been
swept
out
to
sea
by
the
before
they
could
make
a
landing
they
succeeded
however
in
reaching
the
shore
near
mount
pleasant
a
doctor
finally
arrived
but
too
late
to
be
of
any
service
foster
wanted
forty
muskets
to
arm
some
of
his
workmen
as
a
guard
for
the
powder
in
fort
sumter
and
for
valuable
public
property
in
castle
pinckney
this
was
approved
at
washington
but
the
moment
he
obtained
the
guns
from
the
arsenal
the
secretary
of
war
hastily
telegraphed
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
send
them
back
again
immediately
and
yet
at
this
same
period
two
thousand
additional
united
states
muskets
were
forwarded
by
floyd
order
to
south
carolina
and
the
stated
that
five
thousand
more
were
on
their
way
this
did
not
look
much
as
if
the
administration
intended
to
sustain
us
while
the
honorable
secretary
was
thus
supplying
our
enemies
with
arms
and
leaving
the
united
states
arsenal
in
charleston
full
of
military
stores
without
a
guard
he
was
very
solicitous
to
ascertain
whether
our
garrison
duties
were
accurately
performed
and
sent
an
assistant
major
fitz
john
porter
to
make
a
thorough
examination
as
the
secretary
intended
neither
to
nor
withdraw
us
and
as
he
made
no
effort
at
any
time
to
remedy
defects
in
our
armament
this
inspection
seemed
to
us
to
be
a
mere
pretense
it
resulted
however
in
relieving
colonel
gardner
from
his
command
on
porter
recommendation
major
robert
anderson
being
ordered
to
take
his
place
greeley
was
at
this
time
the
head
of
the
republican
party
and
one
of
the
great
leaders
of
northern
opinion
his
immense
services
in
rousing
the
public
mind
to
the
evils
of
slavery
can
not
be
overestimated
but
some
of
his
views
were
too
hastily
formed
and
promulgated
in
this
crisis
of
our
history
he
injured
the
cause
he
afterward
so
eloquently
advocated
by
publishing
an
opinion
on
the
of
november
that
the
south
had
a
perfect
right
to
secede
whenever
a
majority
thought
proper
to
do
so
and
in
another
communication
he
stated
that
the
union
could
not
be
pinned
together
with
bayonets
general
scott
was
also
at
one
time
in
favor
of
letting
the
wayward
sisters
depart
in
peace
and
i
have
heard
on
good
authority
that
at
least
one
member
of
the
cabinet
and
one
leading
general
appalled
by
the
magnitude
of
the
conflict
were
willing
to
consent
to
a
separation
provided
the
border
states
would
go
with
the
north
greeley
article
went
farther
than
this
for
it
seemed
to
favor
a
simple
severance
of
the
north
and
the
south
this
was
not
only
a
virtual
abandonment
of
the
rights
of
northern
men
who
had
invested
their
capital
in
the
southern
states
but
it
amounted
to
giving
up
all
the
and
magnificent
harbors
south
of
new
jersey
including
chesapeake
bay
it
was
expressing
a
willingness
to
surrender
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
the
commerce
of
the
great
and
the
capitol
at
washington
to
the
control
of
a
foreign
nation
hostile
to
us
from
the
very
nature
of
its
institutions
in
fact
it
was
a
proposition
to
commit
national
suicide
the
new
northern
republic
would
have
been
three
thousand
miles
long
and
only
one
hundred
miles
wide
in
the
vicinity
of
wheeling
a
country
of
such
a
peculiar
shape
could
not
as
every
military
man
knows
have
been
successfully
defended
and
must
inevitably
have
soon
broken
up
into
small
confederacies
we
objected
with
reason
to
the
formation
of
a
european
monarchy
in
mexico
but
the
proposed
separation
would
have
created
a
powerful
slave
empire
with
its
northern
border
within
eighteen
miles
of
philadelphia
once
firmly
established
there
and
along
the
ohio
the
southern
army
could
have
burned
cincinnati
from
the
opposite
shore
and
have
penetrated
to
lake
erie
by
a
single
successful
battle
and
march
permanently
severing
the
east
from
the
west
these
unexpected
views
of
greeley
strengthened
the
hands
of
the
disunionists
they
were
everywhere
quoted
as
evidence
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
to
interfere
with
or
coerce
the
south
the
fearful
and
wavering
were
thus
induced
to
join
the
clamorous
majority
i
think
too
that
the
publication
of
these
sentiments
did
much
to
influence
the
of
major
anderson
he
was
not
a
republican
himself
and
he
may
very
well
have
thought
if
the
republican
leaders
did
not
deny
the
right
of
secession
there
was
little
use
in
his
sacrificing
his
small
command
in
a
feeble
attempt
to
make
south
carolina
remain
in
the
union
the
sky
darkened
after
this
for
georgia
voted
a
million
of
dollars
to
raise
troops
and
it
became
evident
that
the
other
southern
states
would
follow
in
the
same
direction
by
the
of
november
we
considered
ourselves
reasonably
secure
against
a
our
guns
were
up
and
loaded
with
canister
and
we
had
a
fair
supply
of
ready
for
use
with
a
view
to
intimidate
those
who
were
planning
an
attack
i
occasionally
fired
toward
the
sea
an
howitzer
loaded
with
double
canister
the
spattering
of
so
many
balls
in
the
water
looked
very
destructive
and
startled
and
amazed
the
gaping
crowds
around
i
also
amused
myself
by
making
some
small
mines
which
would
throw
a
shell
a
few
feet
out
of
the
ground
whenever
any
person
accidentally
trod
upon
a
concealed
plank
of
course
the
shell
did
not
have
a
bursting
charge
in
it
these
experiments
had
a
cooling
effect
upon
the
ardor
of
the
militia
who
did
not
fancy
storming
the
fort
over
a
line
of
torpedoes

in

it
was
now
openly
proclaimed
in
charleston
that
declarations
in
favor
of
the
union
would
no
longer
be
tolerated
that
the
time
for
deliberation
had
passed
and
the
time
for
action
had
come
on
the
our
new
commander
arrived
and
assumed
command
he
felt
as
if
he
had
a
hereditary
right
to
be
there
for
his
father
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
revolutionary
war
in
defense
of
old
fort
moultrie
against
the
british
and
had
been
confined
a
long
time
as
a
prisoner
in
charleston
we
had
long
known
anderson
as
a
gentleman
courteous
honest
intelligent
and
thoroughly
versed
in
his
profession
he
had
been
twice
brevetted
for
gallantry
once
for
services
against
the
seminole
indians
in
florida
and
once
for
the
battle
of
molino
del
rey
in
mexico
where
he
was
badly
wounded
in
politics
he
was
a
strong
man
nevertheless
he
was
opposed
to
secession
and
southern
extremists
he
soon
found
himself
in
troubled
waters
for
the
approaching
battle
of
fort
moultrie
was
talked
of
everywhere
throughout
the
state
and
the
mob
in
charleston
could
hardly
be
restrained
from
making
an
immediate
assault
they
were
kept
back
once
through
the
exertions
of
colonel
benjamin
huger
of
the
ordnance
department
of
the
united
states
army
as
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
most
distinguished
families
in
charleston
he
had
great
influence
there
it
was
said
at
the
time
that
he
threatened
if
we
were
attacked
or
rather
mobbed
in
this
way
he
would
join
us
and
fight
by
the
side
of
his
friend
anderson
colonel
memminger
afterward
the
confederate
secretary
of
the
treasury
also
exerted
himself
to
prevent
any
irregular
and
unauthorized
violence
an
additional
force
of
workmen
having
arrived
from
baltimore
captain
foster
retained
one
hundred
and
twenty
to
continue
the
work
on
fort
moultrie
leaving
his
assistant
lieutenant
snyder
one
hundred
and
nine
men
to
finish
fort
sumter
on
the
of
december
major
anderson
made
a
full
report
to
secretary
floyd
in
relation
to
our
condition
and
resources
it
was
accompanied
with
requisitions
in
due
form
for
supplies
and
military
material
colonel
gardner
before
he
left
had
already
applied
for
rations
for
the
entire
command
for
six
months
previous
to
lincoln
election
governor
gist
had
stated
that
in
that
event
the
state
would
undoubtedly
secede
and
demand
the
forts
and
that
any
hesitation
or
delay
in
giving
them
up
would
lead
to
an
immediate
assault
active
preparations
were
now
in
progress
to
carry
out
this
threat
in
the
first
week
of
december
we
learned
that
cannon
had
been
secretly
sent
to
the
northern
extremity
of
the
island
to
guard
the
channel
and
oppose
the
passage
of
any
vessels
bringing
us
by
that
entrance
we
learned
too
that
lines
of
countervallation
had
been
quietly
marked
out
at
night
with
a
view
to
attack
the
fort
by
regular
approaches
in
case
the
first
assault
failed
also
that
two
thousand
of
the
best
riflemen
in
the
state
were
engaged
to
occupy
an
adjacent
and
the
roofs
of
the
adjoining
houses
all
of
which
overlooked
the
parapet
the
intention
being
to
shoot
us
down
the
moment
we
attempted
to
man
our
guns
yet
the
administration
made
no
arrangements
to
withdraw
us
and
no
effort
to
us
because
to
do
the
former
would
excite
great
indignation
in
the
north
and
the
latter
might
be
treated
as
coercion
by
the
south
so
we
were
left
to
our
own
scanty
resources
with
every
probability
that
the
affair
would
end
in
a
massacre
under
these
circumstances
the
appropriating
of
to
repair
fort
moultrie
and
to
finish
fort
sumter
by
the
mere
order
of
the
secretary
of
war
without
the
authority
of
congress
was
simply
an
expenditure
of
public
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
secessionists
and
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
so
intended
forts
constructed
in
an
enemy
country
and
left
unguarded
are
built
for
the
enemy
congress
met
on
the
of
december
but
took
no
action
in
relation
to
our
peculiar
position
as
usual
their
whole
idea
was
to
settle
the
matter
by
some
new
compromise
the
old
experiment
was
to
be
tried
over
again
michael
and
the
dragon
were
to
lie
down
in
peace
and
become
boon
companions
once
more
the
in
the
south
who
saw
in
lincoln
election
an
end
to
their
pay
and
emoluments
were
secessionists
to
a
man
and
did
their
best
to
keep
up
the
excitement
they
tried
to
make
the
poor
whites
believe
that
through
the
of
the
african
negroes
would
be
for
sale
in
a
short
time
at
thirty
dollars
a
head
and
that
every
laboring
man
would
soon
become
a
rich
and
to
the
timid
they
said
there
would
be
no
coercion
to
the
ambitious
they
spoke
of
military
glory
and
the
formation
of
a
vast
slave
empire
to
include
mexico
central
america
and
the
west
indies
the
merchants
were
assured
that
charleston
would
be
a
free
port
rivaling
new
york
in
its
trade
and
opulence
they
painted
the
future
in
glowing
colors
but
the
present
looked
dreary
enough
all
business
was
at
an
end
the
expenses
of
the
state
had
become
enormous
and
financial
ruin
was
rapidly
approaching
the
heavy
began
to
fear
they
might
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
all
these
military
preparations
in
the
way
of
forced
loans
for
a
time
a
strong
reaction
set
in
against
the
rhett
faction
but
intimidation
and
threats
prevented
any
open
retrograde
movement
among
those
who
were
reported
to
be
most
clamorous
to
have
an
immediate
attack
made
upon
us
was
a
certain
captain
of
the
united
states
dragoons
named
lucius
northrup
afterward
made
of
south
carolina
and
subsequently
through
the
personal
friendship
of
jeff
davis
promoted
to
be
of
the
rebel
army
he
had
resided
for
several
years
in
charleston
on
on
full
pay
before
urging
an
assault
he
should
have
had
the
grace
to
resign
his
commission
for
his
oath
of
office
bound
him
to
be
a
friend
to
his
comrades
in
the
army
and
not
an
enemy
i
am
tempted
in
this
connection
to
show
how
differently
the
rebel
general
magruder
acted
under
similar
circumstances
when
he
was
a
captain
and
brevet
colonel
in
our
service
he
said
to
his
officers
the
evening
before
he
rode
over
the
long
bridge
at
washington
to
join
the
confederates
if
the
rebels
come
we
give
them
hell
but
i
shall
send
in
my
resignation
and
become
a
rebel
myself
amidst
all
this
turmoil
our
little
band
of
regulars
kept
their
spirits
up
and
determined
to
fight
it
out
to
the
last
against
any
force
that
might
be
brought
against
them
the
however
at
work
in
fort
sumter
were
considerably
frightened
they
held
a
meeting
and
resolved
to
defend
themselves
if
attacked
by
the
charleston
roughs
but
not
to
resist
any
organized
force
on
the
of
december
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
get
our
provisions
from
town
without
exciting
observation
they
had
been
lying
there
several
days
it
was
afterward
stated
in
the
papers
that
the
captain
of
the
schooner
was
threatened
severely
for
having
brought
them
on
the
same
day
the
enemy
began
to
build
batteries
at
mount
pleasant
and
at
the
upper
end
of
sullivan
island
guns
having
already
been
sent
there
we
also
heard
that
ladders
had
been
provided
for
parties
to
escalade
our
walls
indeed
the
proposed
attack
was
no
longer
a
secret
gentlemen
from
the
city
said
to
us
we
appreciate
your
position
it
is
a
point
of
honor
with
you
to
hold
the
fort
but
a
political
necessity
obliges
us
to
take
it
my
wife
becoming
indignant
at
these
preparations
and
the
utter
apathy
of
the
government
in
regard
to
our
affairs
wrote
a
stirring
letter
to
my
brother
in
new
york
stating
some
of
the
facts
i
have
mentioned
by
some
means
it
found
its
way
into
the
columns
of
the
and
did
much
to
call
attention
to
the
subject
and
awaken
the
northern
people
to
a
true
sense
of
the
situation
she
was
quite
distressed
to
find
her
hasty
expressions
in
print
and
freely
commented
on
both
by
friends
and
enemies
i
may
say
in
passing
that
the
distinguished
editor
of
that
paper
william
cullen
bryant
proved
to
be
one
of
the
best
friends
we
had
at
the
north
george
curtis
who
aided
us
freely
with
his
pen
and
influence
was
another
they
exerted
themselves
to
benefit
us
in
every
way
and
were
among
the
first
to
invoke
the
patriotism
of
the
nation
to
extricate
us
from
our
difficulties
and
save
the
union
of
the
states
when
we
returned
to
new
york
they
and
their
friends
gave
us
a
cordial
and
heartfelt
welcome
to
resume
the
thread
of
my
narrative
the
fort
by
this
time
had
been
considerably
strengthened
the
crevices
were
filled
up
and
the
walls
were
made
sixteen
feet
high
by
digging
down
to
the
foundations
and
throwing
up
the
surplus
earth
as
a
glacis
each
of
the
officers
had
a
certain
portion
given
him
to
defend
i
caused
a
sloping
picket
fence
technically
called
to
be
projected
over
the
parapet
on
my
side
of
the
work
as
an
obstacle
against
an
escalading
party
i
understood
that
this
puzzled
the
military
men
and
newspapers
in
charleston
exceedingly
they
could
not
imagine
what
object
i
could
have
in
view
one
of
the
editors
said
in
reference
to
it
make
ready
your
sharpened
stakes
but
you
will
not
intimidate
freemen
there
was
one
good
reason
why
our
opponents
did
not
desire
to
commence
immediate
hostilities
the
delay
was
manifestly
to
their
advantage
for
the
engineers
were
putting
fort
sumter
in
good
condition
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states
they
the
rebels
intended
to
occupy
it
as
soon
as
the
work
approached
completion
in
the
mean
time
to
prevent
our
anticipating
them
they
kept
two
steamers
on
guard
to
patrol
the
harbor
and
keep
us
from
crossing
these
boats
contained
one
hundred
and
twenty
soldiers
and
were
under
the
command
of
james
hamilton
who
had
recently
resigned
from
the
united
states
navy
the
threatening
movements
against
fort
moultrie
required
incessant
vigilance
on
our
part
and
we
were
frequently
worn
out
with
watching
and
fatigue
on
one
of
these
occasions
seymour
and
doubleday
volunteered
to
take
the
places
of
captain
seymour
and
myself
and
they
took
turns
in
walking
the
parapet
two
hours
at
a
time
in
readiness
to
notify
the
guard
in
case
the
became
more
than
usually
demonstrative
in
december
the
secretary
sent
another
officer
of
the
department
major
don
carlos
buell
to
examine
and
report
upon
our
condition
buell
bore
written
orders
which
were
presented
on
the
directing
major
anderson
not
to
provoke
hostilities
but
in
case
of
immediate
danger
to
defend
himself
to
the
last
extremity
and
take
any
steps
that
he
might
think
necessary
for
that
purpose
there
would
appear
to
be
some
mystery
connected
with
this
subject
for
anderson
afterward
stated
to
seymour
as
a
reason
for
not
firing
when
the
rebels
attempted
to
sink
the
of
the
that
his
instructions
tied
his
hands
and
obliged
him
to
remain
quiescent
now
as
there
are
no
orders
of
this
character
on
record
in
the
war
department
they
must
have
been
of
a
verbal
and
confidential
nature
in
my
opinion
floyd
was
fully
capable
of
supplementing
written
orders
to
resist
by
verbal
orders
to
surrender
without
resistance
if
he
did
so
i
can
conceive
of
nothing
more
treacherous
for
his
object
must
have
been
to
make
anderson
the
of
whatever
might
occur
buell
however
is
not
the
man
to
be
the
bearer
of
any
treacherous
communication
still
he
did
not
appear
to
sympathize
much
with
us
for
he
expressed
his
disapproval
of
our
defensive
preparations
referring
particularly
to
some
near
the
which
he
said
would
have
a
tendency
to
irritate
the
people
i
thought
the
remark
a
strange
one
under
the
circumstances
as
the
people
were
preparing
to
attack
us
i
had
no
doubt
at
the
time
in
spite
of
the
warlike
message
he
had
brought
that
buell
expressions
reflected
the
wishes
of
his
superiors
i
have
ascertained
recently
that
floyd
did
have
one
or
more
confidential
agents
in
charleston
who
were
secretly
intermeddling
in
this
matter
without
the
sanction
of
the
president
or
the
open
authority
of
the
war
office
it
appears
from
the
records
that
another
assistant
captain
withers
who
joined
the
rebels
at
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
and
became
a
rebel
general
was
also
sent
by
floyd
to
confer
with
anderson
it
is
not
at
all
improbable
therefore
that
some
one
of
the
messengers
who
actually
joined
the
enemy
may
have
been
the
bearer
of
a
treasonable
communication
it
appears
from
anderson
own
statement
that
his
hands
were
tied
and
no
one
that
knew
him
would
ever
doubt
his
veracity
yet
if
he
really
desired
to
retain
possession
of
charleston
harbor
for
the
government
and
floyd
orders
stood
in
his
way
why
did
he
not
after
the
latter
fled
to
the
south
make
a
plain
statement
to
the
new
secretary
judge
holt
whose
patriotism
was
undoubted
and
ask
for
fresh
instructions
it
looks
to
me
very
much
as
if
he
accepted
the
orders
without
question
because
he
preferred
the
policy
of
i
shall
have
occasion
to
refer
to
this
subject
again
in
the
course
of
my
narrative
we
had
frequently
regretted
the
absence
of
a
garrison
in
castle
pinckney
as
that
post
being
within
a
mile
of
charleston
could
easily
control
the
city
by
means
of
its
mortars
and
heavy
guns
we
were
too
ourselves
to
spare
a
single
soldier
the
brave
skillen
who
was
in
charge
there
begged
hard
that
we
would
send
him
a
few
artillerists
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
surrendering
the
work
to
the
enemies
of
the
government
without
a
struggle
and
would
have
made
a
determined
resistance
if
he
could
have
found
any
one
to
stand
by
him
we
talked
the
matter
over
and
captain
foster
thought
he
could
skillen
by
selecting
a
few
reliable
men
from
his
masons
to
assist
in
defending
the
place
he
accordingly
sent
a
body
of
picked
workmen
there
under
his
assistant
lieutenant
meade
with
orders
to
make
certain
repairs
the
moment
however
meade
attempted
to
teach
these
men
the
drill
at
the
heavy
guns
they
drew
back
in
great
alarm
and
it
was
soon
seen
that
no
dependence
could
be
placed
upon
them
so
castle
pinckney
was
left
to
its
fate
as
the
general
government
seemed
quietly
to
have
deserted
us
we
watched
the
public
sentiment
at
the
north
with
much
interest
there
was
but
little
to
encourage
us
there
the
northern
cities
however
were
beginning
to
appreciate
the
gravity
of
the
crisis
at
the
call
of
the
mayor
of
philadelphia
a
great
public
meeting
was
held
in
independence
square
for
one
i
was
thoroughly
dispirited
and
disgusted
at
the
resolutions
that
were
passed
they
were
evidently
prompted
by
the
almighty
dollar
and
the
fear
of
losing
the
southern
trade
they
urged
that
the
north
should
be
more
than
ever
subservient
to
the
south
more
active
in
catching
fugitive
slaves
and
more
careful
not
to
speak
against
the
institution
of
slavery
as
a
pendant
to
these
resolutions
an
official
attempt
was
made
a
few
days
afterward
to
prevent
the
eloquent
republican
orator
george
curtis
from
advocating
the
northern
side
of
the
question
chapter
iv
the
removal
to

of

yancey
lectures
in
the
the
removal
to
fort
sumter
on
the
a
bill
was
passed
to
arm
the
militia
of
north
carolina
on
the
same
day
the
charleston
convention
met
and
chose
general
jamison
as
their
president
and
on
the
of
the
month
the
secession
ordinance
was
duly
passed
and
south
carolina
voted
out
of
the
union
amidst
screams
of
enthusiasm
immediately
afterward
there
was
great
competition
for
the
possession
of
the
immortal
pen
with
which
the
instrument
was
signed
at
the
close
of
the
war
i
heard
it
was
for
sale
at
a
very
low
figure
the
new
governor
francis
pickens
signed
the
ordinance
very
gladly
and
issued
his
proclamation
on
the
declaring
south
carolina
to
be
a
free
and
independent
nation
he
had
served
as
a
member
of
congress
from
to
and
as
minister
to
russia
in
but
he
was
not
considered
a
man
of
decided
ability
he
was
very
impetuous
in
his
disposition
and
according
to
a
statement
made
by
him
in
one
of
his
congressional
speeches
which
attracted
much
attention
at
the
time
he
was
born
insensible
to
fear
soon
after
the
state
seceded
that
stern
old
patriot
judge
petigru
of
south
carolina
came
over
with
one
of
his
friends
to
pay
us
a
final
visit
to
express
the
deep
sorrow
and
sympathy
he
felt
for
us
in
our
trying
position
as
he
knew
that
arrangements
were
being
made
to
drive
us
out
he
bade
us
farewell
with
much
feeling
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
as
he
deplored
the
folly
and
the
madness
of
the
times
he
had
been
previously
asked
in
the
city
if
he
did
not
intend
to
join
the
secession
movement
he
replied
should
think
not
south
carolina
is
too
small
for
a
republic
and
too
large
for
a
at
a
later
period
of
the
war
it
is
said
he
was
called
upon
to
give
up
the
property
of
his
northern
clients
for
confiscation
under
a
law
which
made
it
treason
to
refuse
he
positively
declined
to
comply
with
the
demand
and
said
with
much
spirit
the
time
comes
for
me
to
choose
between
death
and
dishonor
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
saying
which
of
the
two
i
shall
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
he
did
not
live
to
witness
the
final
triumph
of
the
cause
which
was
so
dear
to
him
four
of
buchanan
cabinet
floyd
cobb
toucey
and
thompson
were
now
open
and
avowed
disunionists
on
the
a
defalcation
of
eight
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
was
discovered
in
the
department
of
the
interior
while
the
secretary
jacob
thompson
was
absent
from
his
post
and
acting
as
a
disunion
agent
to
represent
the
state
of
mississippi
this
dallying
with
treason
in
the
cabinet
was
one
of
the
most
discouraging
signs
of
the
times
a
circumstance
now
occurred
which
to
my
mind
was
proof
positive
that
floyd
intended
to
betray
us
and
the
government
he
represented
i
have
no
doubt
it
hastened
our
departure
from
fort
moultrie
he
directed
captain
foster
to
have
the
guns
mounted
in
fort
sumter
immediately
it
was
plain
enough
from
demonstrations
already
made
that
the
moment
this
was
done
the
rebels
would
seize
the
fort
and
turn
its
powerful
armament
upon
us
there
was
no
one
there
to
resist
them
it
seems
to
me
that
speech
to
the
secessionists
of
richmond
made
shortly
after
his
flight
from
washington
was
a
pretty
plain
acknowledgment
that
he
had
violated
his
oath
of
office
as
secretary
of
war
in
order
that
he
might
advance
the
interests
of
the
confederacy
he
said
on
that
occasion
i
undertook
so
to
dispose
of
the
power
in
my
hands
that
when
the
terrific
hour
came
you
and
all
of
you
and
each
of
you
should
say
man
has
done
his
duty
anderson
had
been
urged
by
several
of
us
to
remove
his
command
to
fort
sumter
but
he
had
invariably
replied
that
he
was
specially
assigned
to
fort
moultrie
and
had
no
right
to
vacate
it
without
orders
our
affairs
however
were
becoming
critical
and
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
speak
to
him
again
on
the
subject
he
still
apparently
adhered
to
his
decision
nevertheless
he
had
fully
determined
to
make
the
change
and
was
now
merely
awaiting
a
favorable
opportunity
to
deceive
the
enemy
he
still
kept
at
work
with
unabated
zeal
on
the
defenses
of
fort
moultrie
this
exactly
suited
the
purposes
of
the
rebel
leaders
for
they
knew
we
could
make
no
effectual
defense
there
and
our
preparations
would
only
increase
the
prestige
of
their
victory
we
were
not
authorized
to
commence
hostilities
by
burning
the
adjacent
houses
and
yet
if
they
were
not
leveled
clouds
of
riflemen
could
occupy
them
and
prevent
our
men
from
serving
the
guns
under
any
circumstances
it
was
plain
that
we
must
soon
succumb
from
and
loss
of
sleep
incident
to
repelling
incessant
attacks
from
a
host
of
enemies
the
fact
that
through
the
provident
care
of
the
secretary
of
war
the
guns
of
fort
sumter
would
also
be
turned
upon
us
enfilading
two
sides
of
fort
moultrie
and
taking
another
side
in
reverse
was
quite
decisive
as
to
the
impossibility
of
our
making
a
lengthened
defense
up
to
this
time
we
had
hoped
almost
against
hope
that
even
if
the
government
were
base
enough
to
desert
us
the
loyal
spirit
of
the
patriotic
north
would
manifest
itself
in
our
favor
inasmuch
as
our
little
force
represented
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
but
all
seemed
doubt
apathy
and
confusion
there
yancey
was
delivering
lectures
in
the
northern
states
as
a
representative
of
the
disunionists
not
only
without
molestation
but
with
frequent
and
vociferous
applause
from
the
democratic
masses
who
could
not
be
made
to
believe
there
was
any
real
danger
in
making
his
arrangements
to
cross
over
anderson
acted
with
consummate
prudence
and
ability
he
only
communicated
his
design
to
the
whose
was
indispensable
and
he
waited
until
the
moment
of
execution
before
he
informed
the
others
of
his
intention
no
one
of
course
would
deliberately
betray
a
secret
of
this
kind
but
it
sometimes
happens
under
such
circumstances
that
officers
give
indications
of
what
is
about
to
take
place
by
sending
for
their
washing
packing
their
trunks
and
making
changes
in
their
messing
arrangements
without
knowing
positively
that
any
movement
had
been
projected
two
circumstances
excited
my
suspicions
once
while
i
was
walking
with
the
major
on
the
parapet
he
turned
to
me
abruptly
and
asked
me
what
would
be
the
best
course
to
take
to
render
the
unserviceable
i
told
him
there
were
several
methods
but
my
plan
would
be
to
heap
knots
around
them
and
burn
them
up
the
question
was
too
suggestive
to
escape
my
attention
on
the
day
previous
to
our
departure
i
requested
him
to
allow
me
to
purchase
a
large
quantity
of
wire
to
make
an
entanglement
in
front
of
the
part
of
the
work
i
was
assigned
to
defend
he
said
with
a
quizzical
look
certainly
you
shall
have
a
mile
of
wire
if
you
require
it
when
i
proposed
to
send
for
it
immediately
he
smiled
and
objected
in
such
a
peculiar
way
that
i
at
once
saw
that
he
was
no
longer
interested
in
our
efforts
to
strengthen
fort
moultrie
as
a
preliminary
to
the
proposed
movement
he
directed
the
post
quartermaster
lieutenant
hall
to
charter
three
schooners
and
some
barges
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
transporting
the
families
to
old
fort
johnson
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
harbor
where
there
were
some
dilapidated
public
buildings
belonging
to
the
united
states
the
danger
of
the
approaching
conflict
was
a
good
pretext
for
the
removal
of
the
all
this
seemed
natural
enough
to
the
enemy
and
no
one
offered
any
opposition
in
reality
these
vessels
were
loaded
with
supplies
for
all
the
troops
with
reference
to
a
prolonged
residence
in
fort
sumter
hall
was
directed
to
land
every
thing
there
as
soon
as
a
was
fired
in
the
mean
time
he
sailed
for
fort
johnson
and
lay
off
and
on
waiting
for
the
signal
anderson
had
broken
up
his
own
mess
and
on
the
last
evening
of
our
stay
december
i
left
my
room
to
ask
him
in
to
take
tea
with
us
the
sun
was
just
setting
as
i
ascended
the
steps
leading
to
the
parapet
and
approached
him
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
officers
each
of
whom
seemed
silent
and
distrait
as
i
passed
our
i
remarked
it
is
a
fine
evening
crawford
he
replied
in
a
hesitating
and
embarrassed
manner
showing
that
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
i
saw
plainly
that
something
unusual
had
occurred
anderson
approached
me
as
i
advanced
and
said
quietly
i
have
determined
to
evacuate
this
post
immediately
for
the
purpose
of
occupying
fort
sumter
i
can
only
allow
you
twenty
minutes
to
form
your
company
and
be
in
readiness
to
start
i
was
surprised
at
this
announcement
and
realized
the
gravity
of
the
situation
at
a
glance
we
were
watched
by
spies
and
who
would
undoubtedly
open
fire
upon
us
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
object
of
the
movement
i
was
naturally
concerned
too
for
the
safety
of
my
wife
who
was
the
only
lady
in
the
fort
at
that
time
and
who
would
necessarily
be
exposed
to
considerable
danger
fortunately
i
had
little
or
no
property
to
lose
as
in
anticipation
of
a
crisis
i
had
previously
sent
every
thing
of
value
to
new
york
some
of
the
other
officers
did
not
fare
so
well
the
doctor
not
expecting
so
sudden
a
had
necessarily
left
his
medical
stores
unpacked
foster
who
had
taken
a
house
outside
for
his
family
was
wholly
unprepared
and
lost
heavily
i
made
good
use
of
the
twenty
minutes
allowed
me
i
first
went
to
the
barracks
formed
my
company
inspected
it
and
saw
that
each
man
was
properly
armed
and
equipped
this
left
me
ten
minutes
to
spare
i
dashed
over
to
my
quarters
told
my
wife
to
get
ready
to
leave
immediately
and
as
the
fighting
would
probably
commence
in
a
few
minutes
i
advised
her
to
take
refuge
with
some
family
outside
and
get
behind
the
as
soon
as
possible
to
avoid
the
shot
she
hastily
threw
her
into
her
trunks
and
i
called
two
men
to
put
her
baggage
outside
the
main
gate
i
then
accompanied
her
there
and
we
took
a
sad
and
hasty
leave
of
each
other
for
neither
knew
when
or
where
we
would
meet
again
as
soon
as
this
was
accomplished
i
strapped
on
my
revolver
tied
a
blanket
across
my
shoulders
and
reported
to
major
anderson
that
my
men
were
in
readiness
to
move
in
the
mean
time
lieutenant
jefferson
davis
of
my
company
who
had
been
detailed
to
command
the
rear
guard
aimed
the
guns
which
were
already
loaded
to
bear
upon
the
passage
to
fort
sumter
and
captain
foster
and
crawford
with
two
sergeants
and
three
privates
remained
with
him
and
took
post
at
five
columbiads
in
readiness
to
carry
out
major
anderson
design
which
was
to
sink
the
should
they
attempt
to
fire
into
us
or
run
us
down
while
certainly
the
major
showed
no
lack
of
determination
or
energy
on
this
occasion
if
we
were
successful
in
crossing
davis
was
to
follow
with
the
remainder
of
the
men
foster
and
moale
agreed
to
remain
behind
until
morning
they
also
volunteered
to
place
themselves
at
the
guns
and
cover
the
retreat
of
the
rear
guard
under
davis
in
case
an
attempt
was
made
to
intercept
them
the
chaplain
the
rev
matthias
harris
being
a
and
having
his
family
in
the
village
was
not
notified
neither
was
surgeon
simons
of
the
army
who
was
living
in
a
house
adjoining
the
fort
and
directly
in
line
with
our
guns
when
he
saw
the
movement
in
progress
he
hastened
out
with
his
family
to
shelter
them
behind
the
as
soon
as
possible
every
thing
being
in
readiness
we
passed
out
of
the
main
gates
and
silently
made
our
way
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
a
spot
where
the
boats
were
hidden
behind
an
irregular
pile
of
rocks
which
originally
formed
part
of
the
there
was
not
a
single
human
being
in
sight
as
we
marched
to
the
rendezvous
and
we
had
the
extraordinary
good
luck
to
be
wholly
unobserved
we
found
several
boats
awaiting
us
under
charge
of
two
engineer
officers
lieutenants
snyder
and
meade
they
and
their
crews
were
crouched
down
behind
the
rocks
to
escape
observation
in
a
low
tone
they
pointed
out
to
me
the
boats
intended
for
my
company
and
then
pushed
out
rapidly
to
return
to
the
fort
noticing
that
one
of
the
was
approaching
they
made
a
wide
circuit
to
avoid
it
i
hoped
there
would
be
time
for
my
party
to
cross
before
the
steamer
could
overhaul
us
but
as
among
my
men
there
were
a
number
of
unskillful
oarsmen
we
made
but
slow
progress
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
we
would
be
overtaken
in
it
was
after
sunset
and
the
twilight
had
deepened
so
that
there
was
a
fair
chance
for
us
to
escape
while
the
steamer
was
yet
afar
off
i
took
off
my
cap
and
threw
open
my
coat
to
conceal
the
buttons
i
also
made
the
men
take
off
their
coats
and
use
them
to
cover
up
their
muskets
which
were
lying
alongside
the
rowlocks
i
hoped
in
this
way
that
we
might
pass
for
a
party
of
laborers
returning
to
the
fort
the
stopped
within
about
a
hundred
yards
of
us
but
to
our
great
relief
after
a
slight
scrutiny
the
steamer
kept
on
its
way
in
the
mean
time
our
men
redoubled
their
efforts
and
we
soon
arrived
at
our
destination
as
we
ascended
the
steps
of
the
wharf
crowds
of
workmen
rushed
out
to
meet
us
most
of
them
wearing
secession
emblems
one
or
two
union
men
among
them
cheered
lustily
but
the
majority
called
out
angrily
what
are
these
soldiers
doing
here
i
at
once
formed
my
men
charged
bayonets
drove
the
tumultuous
mass
inside
the
fort
and
seized
the
which
commanded
the
main
entrance
i
then
placed
sentinels
to
prevent
the
crowd
from
encroaching
on
us
as
soon
as
we
had
disembarked
the
boats
were
sent
back
for
seymour
company
the
major
landed
soon
after
in
one
of
the
engineer
boats
which
had
coasted
along
to
avoid
the
steamer
seymour
men
arrived
in
safety
followed
soon
after
by
the
remaining
detachments
which
had
been
left
behind
as
a
the
latter
however
ran
a
good
deal
of
risk
for
in
the
dark
it
passed
almost
under
the
bow
of
the
the
whole
movement
was
successful
beyond
our
most
sanguine
expectations
and
we
were
highly
elated
the
was
fired
and
hall
at
once
sailed
over
and
landed
the
soldiers
families
and
supplies
as
soon
as
the
schooners
were
unloaded
the
disloyal
workmen
were
placed
on
board
and
shipped
off
to
the
only
a
few
of
the
best
and
most
reliable
were
retained
upon
leaving
me
my
wife
took
refuge
temporarily
in
the
residence
of
dan
sinclair
the
sutler
of
the
post
a
most
excellent
man
and
one
to
whom
we
were
indebted
for
many
kindnesses
finding
that
the
people
of
moultrieville
were
not
yet
aware
of
the
change
that
had
taken
place
and
that
every
thing
was
tranquil
she
ventured
back
to
the
fort
and
finished
the
removal
of
all
our
effects
after
this
in
company
with
the
chaplain
family
she
walked
up
and
down
the
beach
the
greater
part
of
the
night
looking
anxiously
toward
fort
sumter
to
see
if
there
were
any
indications
of
trouble
or
disturbance
there
in
the
morning
she
took
up
her
residence
at
the
chaplain
house
as
for
the
other
ladies
both
simons
and
foster
fled
to
the
city
at
the
first
intimation
of

a
new
outrage
on
the
very
day
that
these
events
occurred
the
south
carolina
commissioners
barnwell
adams
and
james
orr
arrived
in
washington
to
treat
for
the
surrender
of
the
forts
and
other
public
property
it
proved
to
be
a
very
inauspicious
time
for
such
a
negotiation
our
garrison
were
up
betimes
on
the
morning
of
the
to
inspect
their
new
quarters
the
soldiers
thronged
the
parapet
in
such
numbers
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
troops
on
board
the
that
vessel
steamed
up
to
the
city
in
great
haste
and
communicated
the
startling
intelligence
that
fort
sumter
in
some
inexplicable
manner
had
been
fully
the
chagrin
of
the
authorities
was
intense
messengers
were
at
once
dispatched
to
all
parts
of
the
city
to
ring
the
and
arouse
the
people
while
this
was
going
on
in
town
anderson
who
was
very
punctilious
in
regard
to
settling
all
debts
due
by
the
united
states
to
citizens
determined
to
send
a
detachment
under
lieutenant
davis
back
to
fort
moultrie
as
a
guard
to
captain
foster
to
enable
him
to
pay
off
the
claims
of
the
workmen
he
had
left
behind
doctor
crawford
went
over
also
to
look
after
some
of
his
medical
property
as
the
had
been
withdrawn
they
reached
the
fort
without
difficulty
and
found
it
deserted
the
people
of
the
little
village
to
all
appearance
were
still
ignorant
of
our
change
of
station
soon
after
their
arrival
the
party
in
accordance
with
instructions
from
major
anderson
set
fire
to
the
bearing
on
fort
sumter
and
destroyed
all
the
ammunition
and
military
material
that
could
not
be
brought
away
the
guns
had
been
spiked
the
night
before
and
the
was
cut
down
either
at
that
time
or
in
the
morning
as
i
have
stated
the
major
took
great
pains
to
see
that
all
bills
even
those
of
a
private
nature
due
in
charleston
we
fully
paid
by
the
officers
and
men
of
his
command
but
many
leading
merchants
in
the
city
were
not
so
scrupulous
they
gladly
took
advantage
of
the
war
to
repudiate
the
claims
of
their
northern
creditors
i
was
also
informed
by
one
of
the
that
a
number
of
officers
of
the
army
who
resigned
to
join
the
rebellion
first
deliberately
drew
their
month
pay
in
advance
and
then
left
the
as
a
penalty
for
his
kindness
to
make
good
the
deficiency
from
his
private
funds
in
order
to
settle
his
accounts
foster
and
davis
finding
fort
moultrie
still
deserted
made
good
use
of
the
occasion
by
loading
up
with
supplies
and
ammunition
one
of
the
schooners
which
had
been
previously
chartered
to
carry
over
the
women
and
children
and
which
were
now
lying
empty
at
the
wharf
on
their
way
back
from
this
expedition
our
officers
saw
the
charleston
troops
going
over
to
take
possession
of
castle
pinckney
the
calm
and
dignified
south
carolina
legislature
had
not
authorized
this
outrageous
proceeding
even
if
we
assume
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
secede
it
does
not
follow
that
the
public
property
within
her
limits
properly
belonged
to
her
it
appertained
to
the
nation
at
large
inasmuch
as
all
the
other
states
had
contributed
toward
it
and
therefore
it
was
a
proper
subject
of
negotiation
to
seize
it
at
once
without
a
declaration
of
war
and
while
the
subject
was
still
pending
was
a
violation
of
all
right
and
precedent
the
governor
however
irritated
at
our
change
of
station
took
the
responsibility
of
commencing
hostilities
against
the
union
without
the
of
the
legislature
and
this
too
at
a
time
when
the
state
was
almost
destitute
of
war
material
and
funds
i
doubt
if
there
were
more
than
half
a
dozen
heavy
guns
on
hand
and
there
were
certainly
not
a
dozen
rounds
of
for
each
major
anderson
who
was
a
very
religious
man
thought
it
best
to
give
some
solemnity
to
our
occupation
of
fort
sumter
by
formally
raising
the
flag
at
noon
with
prayer
and
military
ceremonies
the
band
played
the
banner
the
troops
presented
arms
and
our
chaplain
the
rev
matthias
harris
offered
up
a
fervent
supplication
invoking
the
blessing
of
heaven
upon
our
small
command
and
the
cause
we
represented
three
cheers
were
then
given
for
the
flag
and
the
troops
were
dismissed
the
seizure
of
castle
pinckney
on
the
afternoon
of
the
was
the
first
overt
act
of
the
secessionists
against
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
as
already
stated
it
was
ordered
by
governor
pickens
on
his
own
responsibility
without
the
concurrence
of
the
legislature
the
latter
indeed
positively
declined
to
sanction
the
measure
at
the
washington
light
infantry
and
meagher
guards
both
companies
of
colonel
petigru
rifle
regiment
embarked
under
command
of
that
officer
on
board
the
and
steamed
down
to
the
little
island
upon
which
the
castle
is
situated
when
they
arrived
in
front
of
the
main
gates
they
found
them
closed
whereupon
they
applied
and
with
eager
flushed
faces
made
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
wall
the
excitement
was
needless
for
there
was
no
one
there
to
resist
them
the
only
present
being
lieutenant
meade
of
the
engineers
and
skillen
who
resided
there
with
his
family
and
who
was
in
charge
of
the
work
meade
himself
a
virginian
had
a
sharp
colloquy
with
petigru
and
expressed
himself
in
severe
terms
in
relation
to
this
treasonable
assault
after
taking
possession
one
of
the
rebel
officers
found
the
daughter
pretty
kate
skillen
aged
fifteen
weeping
bitterly
at
the
foot
of
the
ramparts
he
assured
her
no
harm
should
befall
her
she
replied
i
am
not
crying
because
i
am
afraid
what
is
the
matter
then
said
he
i
am
crying
because
you
have
put
that
miserable
rag
up
there
she
said
pointing
to
the
palmetto
flag
which
had
just
been
raised
to
the
top
of
the
staff
foster
few
reliable
workmen
proved
to
be
a
bad
investment
it
is
said
that
most
of
them
when
they
found
the
enemy
were
actually
coming
hid
in
closets
sheds
and
under
the
beds
and
some
cried
bitterly
while
this
was
going
on
major
anderson
and
myself
stood
side
by
side
on
the
parapet
watching
the
scene
through
our
from
his
expressions
of
indignation
i
was
in
hopes
he
would
take
prompt
measures
to
close
the
harbor
against
any
further
encroachments
of
the
state
troops
made
with
a
view
to
occupy
fort
moultrie
or
fort
johnson
it
would
have
required
but
a
short
time
to
mount
a
few
pieces
and
when
these
were
once
in
position
it
would
have
been
easy
to
cut
off
all
direct
communication
by
water
between
the
different
posts
in
short
he
could
take
entire
possession
of
the
harbor
he
did
threaten
to
put
out
the
lights
in
the
with
his
artillery
and
close
the
port
in
that
way
but
his
anger
soon
passed
away
and
he
took
no
aggressive
measures
of
any
kind
in
my
opinion
if
he
could
have
been
satisfied
that
no
other
states
would
join
south
carolina
in
her
mad
attempt
he
would
have
done
every
thing
that
lay
in
his
power
to
punish
her
for
he
looked
upon
her
as
a
spoiled
child
that
needed
correction
having
married
a
lady
from
georgia
he
had
almost
identified
himself
with
that
state
he
did
own
a
plantation
and
negroes
there
but
had
recently
sold
them
the
purchaser
afterward
refused
to
pay
for
them
on
the
ground
that
anderson
had
destroyed
their
value
by
virtually
warring
against
slavery
at
this
period
the
feeling
in
many
parts
of
the
south
was
strong
against
south
carolina
this
was
particularly
the
case
among
the
young
men
of
georgia
who
looked
upon
the
leaders
of
secession
in
the
palmetto
state
as
very
presuming
because
these
leaders
thought
and
acted
as
if
they
were
the
only
representatives
of
southern
sentiment
and
as
if
the
leadership
belonged
to
them
as
a
matter
of
right
they
seemed
to
consider
that
the
mere
fact
of
being
born
in
south
carolina
or
carolina
as
they
called
it
contemptuously
ignoring
north
carolina
constituted
in
itself
a
patent
of
nobility
and
their
implied
scorn
of
other
states
caused
the
antagonistic
feeling
which
i
have
mentioned
this
was
shared
by
anderson
until
he
found
that
georgia
also
would
certainly
secede
he
then
seemed
to
lose
all
interest
in
the
union
and
merely
desired
to
become
a
spectator
of
the
contest
and
not
an
actor
his
efforts
thenceforth
were
simply
confined
to
making
his
fort
secure
against
an
assault
hardly
any
amount
of
provocation
could
induce
him
to
become
the
assailant
on
the
day
we
left
fort
moultrie
captain
humphreys
of
the
engineers
arrived
there
from
washington
with
orders
for
captain
foster
from
the
secretary
of
war
i
have
never
learned
the
purport
of
these
dispatches
on
the
the
day
after
we
evacuated
the
place
wilmot
de
saussure
arrived
at
fort
moultrie
at
with
his
battalion
of
charleston
artillery
and
thirty
riflemen
in
all
one
hundred
and
seventy
men
the
companies
composing
the
battalion
were
the
marion
artillery
the
la
fayette
artillery
the
german
artillery
and
the
washington
artillery
i
was
informed
by
a
spectator
that
the
were
exceedingly
cautious
in
making
an
entrance
they
were
looking
out
for
mines
in
all
directions
and
had
brought
ladders
with
them
on
the
supposition
that
there
might
be
torpedoes
in
front
of
the
main
gates
it
was
a
clear
beautiful
evening
and
the
moon
was
at
the
full
they
were
greatly
enraged
to
find
the
cut
down
for
they
had
hoped
to
run
up
their
own
flag
on
the
very
spot
where
ours
had
formerly
waved
they
found
too
the
burned
and
the
guns
which
had
gradually
settled
down
as
the
carriages
gave
way
resting
with
their
breeches
on
the
platforms
and
the
muzzles
leaning
against
the
walls
out
of
the
mouth
of
each
hung
a
small
white
string
as
many
of
the
guns
had
been
kept
loaded
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
these
strings
had
been
tied
by
me
to
the
cartridges
in
order
that
the
latter
might
be
pulled
out
and
sunned
occasionally
as
a
precaution
against
dampness
de
saussure
men
imagined
that
these
strings
were
arranged
with
a
view
to
blow
up
the
guns
the
moment
any
one
attempted
to
interfere
with
them
and
each
soldier
as
he
passed
avoided
the
supposed
danger
the
south
carolina
officers
at
this
period
spent
much
of
their
time
in
discussing
military
problems
one
of
these
which
was
afterward
referred
to
us
for
solution
occasioned
us
much
amusement
all
used
in
the
army
and
exposed
to
the
weather
are
coated
with
a
varnish
of
to
protect
them
from
rust
many
of
those
we
left
behind
were
in
piles
near
the
guns
and
when
the
carriages
were
burned
the
tar
melted
ran
down
in
streams
and
coagulated
in
lumps
it
was
immediately
reported
that
before
leaving
we
had
taken
great
pains
to
tar
the
balls
to
render
them
useless
the
problem
which
puzzled
the
military
of
charleston
was
to
determine
in
what
way
were
ruined
by
tar
some
months
afterward
when
we
evacuated
fort
sumter
one
of
the
officers
who
had
been
much
interested
in
this
subject
took
seymour
aside
and
asked
him
confidentially
if
he
had
any
objection
to
tell
him
why
we
tarred
our
balls
assuring
him
most
earnestly
that
they
could
scrape
it
all
off
upon
occupying
fort
sumter
we
found
it
was
in
a
very
unfinished
condition
and
that
it
would
require
an
immense
amount
of
labor
to
render
it
safe
against
an
assault
it
had
no
flanking
defenses
whatever
three
or
four
hundred
men
with
short
ladders
could
easily
have
taken
it
for
no
guns
were
mounted
except
a
few
on
the
gorge
and
all
the
embrasures
were
open
there
being
no
efficient
means
of
closing
them
on
the
gorge
side
where
the
wharf
was
located
there
were
two
and
numerous
windows
to
be
guarded
in
the
second
story
the
embrasures
were
nothing
but
large
unfinished
openings
slightly
boarded
up
three
or
four
blows
of
an
axe
would
have
made
a
broad
entrance
for
an
escalading
party
the
form
of
the
fort
was
a
pentagon
retaining
a
small
force
as
a
reserve
in
the
centre
of
the
work
we
could
only
furnish
eight
men
to
defend
each
side
and
guard
all
the
numerous
openings
fortunately
no
assault
was
made
it
was
thought
the
fort
was
almost
impregnable
and
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
inducing
buchanan
to
order
us
back
to
fort
moultrie
this
occasioned
a
delay
and
gave
us
time
to
strengthen
our
position
we
were
hard
at
work
mounting
guns
preparing
shells
to
be
used
as
stopping
up
surplus
embrasures
and
removing
the
débris
which
encumbered
the
passages
from
one
part
of
the
work
to
another
quarters
were
selected
for
the
officers
soldiers
and
and
the
household
furniture
which
belonged
to
each
and
which
had
been
thrown
on
the
was
all
separated
and
deposited
in
the
different
rooms
i
chose
an
apartment
near
the
mess
hall
and
made
it
so
comfortable
that
anderson
and
seymour
came
there
temporarily
to
live
with
me
our
mess
was
also
organized
and
placed
in
charge
of
edward
moale
in
the
afternoon
governor
pickens
sent
colonel
petigru
and
major
elison
capers
both
of
the
rifle
regiment
in
full
uniform
to
interview
major
anderson
their
looks
were
full
of
wrath
and
they
bowed
stiffly
and
indignantly
in
answer
to
our
smiling
salutations
i
was
present
at
the
conversation
that
ensued
but
did
not
take
notes
they
told
the
major
that
perhaps
he
was
not
aware
that
an
agreement
had
been
entered
into
with
president
buchanan
not
to
the
forts
in
the
harbor
they
desired
to
call
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
his
recent
movement
was
in
direct
violation
of
the
contract
referred
to
they
were
therefore
directed
by
the
governor
to
request
him
peremptorily
but
courteously
to
immediately
return
to
fort
moultrie
anderson
replied
in
substance
that
he
knew
nothing
of
any
such
agreement
that
as
commander
of
the
defenses
of
charleston
he
had
an
inherent
right
to
occupy
any
fort
in
the
harbor
he
stated
that
he
too
was
a
southern
man
that
he
believed
the
whole
difficulty
was
brought
on
by
the
faithlessness
of
the
north
here
the
aids
made
a
stiff
bow
but
as
regards
returning
to
fort
moultrie
he
could
not
and
he
would
not
do
it
the
commissioners
were
then
courteously
dismissed
i
have
always
felt
that
this
was
a
most
insolent
demand
if
the
governor
considered
himself
aggrieved
by
our
change
of
station
his
redress
lay
in
an
appeal
to
washington
this
attempt
to
assume
command
of
us
and
order
us
out
of
a
united
states
fort
was
an
assumption
of
authority
that
merited
a
more
spirited
reply
before
his
messengers
left
i
took
occasion
in
conversation
with
a
person
who
came
over
in
the
boat
with
them
to
refer
to
the
great
strength
of
the
work
and
i
also
spoke
of
the
shells
which
we
had
prepared
to
throw
down
on
the
heads
of
an
attacking
party
i
knew
the
conversation
would
be
repeated
and
hoped
it
might
have
some
effect
in
deterring
an
immediate
assault
a
new
outrage
now
took
place
in
full
view
of
our
garrison
the
united
states
which
lay
anchored
in
the
stream
was
turned
over
by
its
commander
captain
coste
to
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
the
previous
seizures
made
without
a
declaration
of
war
had
been
justified
on
the
ground
that
the
forts
and
public
buildings
were
fixtures
within
the
limits
of
the
state
to
retain
this
vessel
was
simply
an
act
of
piracy
when
it
became
apparent
that
south
carolina
did
not
control
the
administration
in
washington
and
that
anderson
would
not
be
ordered
back
it
is
possible
a
boat
attack
might
have
been
organized
against
us
but
a
storm
came
up
about
this
time
and
the
wind
was
so
violent
that
no
small
boat
could
venture
out
with
safety
this
occasioned
still
further
delay
which
enabled
us
to
do
much
toward
placing
the
fort
in
a
better
condition
for
defense

property
on

leaving
the
commissioners
made
a
formal
call
upon
the
president
the
latter
expected
some
apology
or
explanation
in
relation
to
the
outrages
which
had
been
perpetrated
had
they
temporized
or
even
used
conciliatory
language
on
this
occasion
it
is
possible
the
south
might
still
have
preserved
the
ascendancy
it
had
always
held
in
the
councils
of
the
president
fortunately
they
assumed
an
air
of
injured
innocence
and
required
buchanan
to
humble
himself
before
them
for
the
past
and
give
guarantees
for
the
future
by
immediately
ordering
fort
sumter
to
be
vacated
that
is
by
surrendering
to
the
state
all
public
property
in
charleston
harbor
which
had
not
been
already
stolen
for
once
the
president
whose
personal
integrity
was
called
in
question
was
thoroughly
roused
and
made
the
only
answer
which
suited
the
circumstances
he
ordered
a
to
proceed
to
charleston
immediately
drive
the
state
garrisons
out
of
the
forts
and
take
possession
of
the
city
he
might
indeed
have
arrested
the
commissioners
for
high
treason
but
his
unionism
was
of
a
very
mild
type
and
far
from
being
aggressive
one
of
the
commissioners
adams
hastened
to
telegraph
to
the
authorities
of
charleston
on
the
to
prepare
for
war
immediately
as
there
were
no
longer
any
hopes
of
a
peaceful
settlement
this
dispatch
caused
a
great
uproar
and
excitement
in
charleston
the
banks
at
once
suspended
specie
payments
all
was
terror
and
confusion
for
it
was
expected
that
a
fleet
would
bombard
the
city
and
land
troops
and
there
were
no
adequate
means
of
opposing
its
entrance
castle
pinckney
indeed
might
offer
some
resistance
but
as
it
had
been
a
dependency
of
fort
sumter
and
unoccupied
little
if
any
ammunition
was
kept
there
the
governor
rushed
frantically
down
to
fort
moultrie
to
hasten
the
preparations
for
defense
were
urged
to
leave
moultrieville
at
once
the
laborers
formerly
employed
by
captain
foster
were
again
hired
by
the
state
engineers
and
were
kept
at
work
thereafter
night
and
day
in
piling
up
to
shield
the
troops
from
the
fire
of
fort
sumter
the
batteries
at
the
extremity
of
sullivan
island
which
were
made
up
of
a
few
old
brought
from
the
citadel
academy
in
the
city
were
hastily
put
in
order
to
protect
the
entrance
by
that
channel
as
for
fort
moultrie
before
we
left
we
had
rendered
its
armament
useless
at
this
time
the
guns
were
still
spiked
and
the
workshops
in
the
city
were
going
night
and
day
to
replace
the
that
had
been
burned
in
place
of
these
some
of
the
guns
and
carriages
were
sent
over
from
castle
pinckney
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
fortify
the
morris
island
channel
and
vessels
could
enter
there
without
the
slightest
difficulty
it
took
several
days
to
transfer
the
guns
and
make
the
preparations
i
have
mentioned
it
follows
therefore
that
if
the
administration
had
acted
promptly
charleston
could
have
been
taken
at
once
and
full
reparation
exacted
for
all
the
wrongs
perpetrated
against
the
united
states
why
this
was
not
done
will
be
explained
hereafter
foster
had
not
been
able
to
settle
with
all
his
workmen
and
the
rebels
frequently
sent
them
over
under
a
flag
of
truce
to
demand
their
back
pay
and
act
as
spies
i
was
enabled
through
this
channel
to
keep
up
a
correspondence
with
my
wife
who
was
still
in
moultrieville
i
learned
all
that
was
going
on
there
and
took
occasion
to
inform
her
that
we
had
no
means
of
lighting
up
our
quarters
a
serious
inconvenience
in
those
long
winter
nights
she
purchased
a
gross
of
matches
and
a
box
of
candles
and
had
them
put
on
board
one
of
the
boats
referred
to
in
full
view
of
a
rebel
sentinel
who
was
supervising
the
embarkation
she
then
requested
one
of
the
crew
an
old
soldier
named
who
formerly
belonged
to
my
company
to
deliver
them
to
me
which
he
agreed
to
do
the
sentinel
stared
but
the
manner
in
which
she
acted
made
him
think
it
must
be
all
right
and
he
did
not
interfere
the
box
arrived
safely
and
added
very
much
to
our
comfort
and
convenience
when
the
governor
found
that
the
spell
of
southern
supremacy
was
broken
and
that
there
was
no
probability
that
we
would
be
ordered
back
to
fort
moultrie
he
was
in
a
very
angry
mood
he
stopped
our
mail
for
a
time
and
cut
off
all
communication
with
us
we
were
of
course
prevented
from
purchasing
fresh
provisions
and
reduced
to
pork
beans
and
anderson
was
quite
indignant
at
this
proceeding
and
again
talked
of
shutting
up
the
port
by
putting
out
the
lights
in
the
while
the
leaders
in
the
city
complained
bitterly
to
the
public
of
anderson
for
his
perfidy
in
occupying
fort
sumter
they
did
not
hesitate
among
themselves
to
express
their
admiration
for
his
acuteness
in
evading
the
dangers
and
difficulties
which
surrounded
him
and
for
the
skillful
manner
in
which
he
had
accomplished
it
our
life
now
proved
to
be
one
of
great
hardship
captain
seymour
and
myself
were
the
only
officers
for
duty
as
officers
of
the
day
lieutenant
davis
and
lieutenant
hall
serving
under
us
as
officers
of
the
guard
the
situation
required
constant
vigilance
lieutenant
talbot
being
a
great
sufferer
from
was
unable
to
do
this
kind
of
duty
we
were
therefore
very
busy
during
the
day
superintending
measures
for
defense
and
were
obliged
to
be
on
the
alert
and
wide
awake
every
other
night
so
that
we
were
completely
exhausted
in
a
short
time
crawford
having
no
sick
in
hospital
generously
offered
to
do
duty
as
officer
of
the
day
and
his
offer
was
gladly
accepted
the
two
young
engineer
officers
snyder
and
meade
were
also
willing
to
serve
as
line
officers
but
captain
foster
thought
it
was
contrary
to
precedent
and
they
were
not
detailed
as
the
engineer
department
is
regarded
in
this
country
as
the
highest
branch
of
the
military
service
and
as
its
officers
are
really
very
able
men
i
can
not
conceive
what
induced
them
to
build
fort
sumter
without
any
flanking
defenses
whatever
and
without
quarters
for
the
officers
the
first
defect
i
endeavored
to
remedy
by
projecting
galleries
over
the
angles
of
the
parapet
i
left
small
in
the
bottom
of
these
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
down
shells
on
the
heads
of
any
party
below
attempting
to
force
an
entrance
through
the
embrasures
the
other
defect
the
presence
of
so
much
combustible
matter
in
the
quarters
it
was
impossible
to
remedy
and
it
ultimately
cost
the
loss
of
the
fort
the
excuse
that
it
never
could
have
been
anticipated
that
the
fort
would
be
attacked
from
the
land
side
is
hardly
a
valid
one
for
a
foreign
fleet
might
possibly
have
effected
a
landing
on
morris
island
or
they
might
have
set
fire
to
the
quarters
from
the
decks
of
the
vessels
by
means
of
incendiary
shells
as
may
well
be
supposed
there
was
a
great
deal
of
excitement
in
new
york
in
relation
to
us
and
in
view
of
the
small
number
of
men
available
for
service
in
the
regular
army
three
of
the
principal
citizens
james
hamilton
moses
grinnell
and
williams
offered
at
their
own
expense
about
the
last
of
december
to
send
us
four
hundred
picked
artillerists
from
the
citizen
soldiery
of
the
city
but
general
scott
refused
to
entertain
the
proposition
on
the
of
january
we
took
an
account
of
our
resources
and
found
we
had
but
one
month
supply
of
fuel
for
cooking
purposes
but
few
candles
and
no
soap
there
was
however
a
small
inside
the
fort
and
we
found
a
little
oil
stored
there
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
time
had
now
come
when
forbearance
ceased
to
be
a
virtue
even
our
opponents
were
willing
to
acknowledge
that
we
represented
a
legitimate
government
and
that
both
duty
and
propriety
called
upon
us
to
resist
the
numerous
war
measures
which
the
governor
of
south
carolina
had
inaugurated
he
had
taken
forcible
possession
of
two
united
states
forts
of
the
money
in
the
of
the
itself
and
of
other
national
property
in
charleston
he
had
closed
the
harbor
by
destroying
the
costly
prismatic
lenses
in
the
and
by
withdrawing
the
warning
from
rattlesnake
shoal
he
had
cut
off
all
communication
between
us
and
the
city
and
had
seized
the
united
states
mails
his
steamboats
laden
with
war
material
to
be
used
in
erecting
batteries
against
us
were
allowed
to
pass
and
repass
fort
sumter
not
only
without
opposition
but
without
even
a
protest
worse
than
all
he
had
commenced
imprisoning
the
crews
of
merchant
vessels
for
contumacy
in
refusing
to
acknowledge
his
authority
as
the
head
of
an
independent
nation
in
vain
did
these
vessels
reverse
their
flags
in
a
mute
appeal
to
us
to
use
our
guns
in
their
defense
anderson
would
do
nothing
not
even
send
a
communication
to
the
governor
on
the
subject
although
the
latter
without
authority
from
the
state
legislature
was
thus
wielding
all
the
powers
of
a
military
dictator
the
enemy
were
greatly
emboldened
at
our
weakness
or
timidity
and
with
good
reason
for
they
saw
us
stand
by
with
folded
arms
and
allow
steamboat
loads
of
ammunition
and
war
material
to
pass
us
on
their
way
to
morris
island
to
be
used
in
the
erection
and
arming
of
batteries
to
prevent
any
united
states
vessels
from
coming
to
our
assistance
major
anderson
was
neither
timid
nor
irresolute
and
he
was
fully
aware
of
his
duties
and
responsibilities
unfortunately
he
desired
not
only
to
save
the
union
but
to
save
slavery
with
it
without
this
he
considered
the
contest
as
hopeless
in
this
spirit
he
submitted
to
every
thing
and
delayed
all
action
in
the
expectation
that
congress
would
make
some
new
and
more
binding
compromise
which
would
restore
peace
to
the
country
he
could
not
read
the
signs
of
the
times
and
see
that
the
conscience
of
the
nation
and
the
progress
of
civilization
had
already
doomed
slavery
to
destruction
if
he
had
taken
this
view
of
the
situation
he
would
have
made
more
strenuous
efforts
to
hold
on
to
the
harbor
of
charleston
and
the
one
hundred
and
twenty
millions
of
dollars
more
or
less
spent
to
regain
it
might
still
have
formed
part
of
the
national
treasury
the
applause
which
both
in
the
north
and
south
greeted
his
masterly
movement
of
the
of
december
made
him
feel
more
like
an
arbiter
between
two
contending
nations
than
a
simple
soldier
engaged
in
carrying
out
the
instructions
of
his
superiors
to
show
the
spirit
in
which
he
acted
it
is
only
necessary
to
quote
from
his
letter
to
governor
pickens
while
the
rebellion
was
still
pending
he
wrote
my
dear
governor
my
heart
was
never
in
this
war
this
sentiment
was
repeated
by
him
in
letters
to
other
parties
and
strange
to
say
was
actually
sent
in
the
form
of
an
official
communication
to
the
of
the
army
the
difficulties
he
experienced
in
his
unavailing
attempts
to
defer
hostilities
seriously
impaired
his
health
and
spirits
and
ultimately
brought
on
the
disease
which
kept
him
almost
entirely
out
of
service
during
the
remainder
of
the
war
and
in
all
probability
hastened
his
death
however
much
i
differed
from
him
in
regard
to
his
sentiments
i
take
pleasure
in
stating
that
aside
from
his
political
career
the
graces
of
his
private
life
were
such
as
to
win
the
esteem
and
regard
of
all
who
knew
him

scott
the
assented
to
the
arrangement
at
the
time
but
unfortunately
he
was
afterward
seized
with
doubts
as
to
whether
the
withdrawing
of
so
many
men
from
fortress
monroe
might
not
endanger
its
safety
and
that
being
a
far
more
important
work
than
fort
sumter
he
did
not
like
to
run
any
risk
in
relation
to
it
he
therefore
induced
buchanan
to
change
the
order
and
substitute
for
the
a
merchant
vessel
loaded
with
supplies
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
recruits
this
was
a
fatal
error
for
the
steamer
chosen
the
of
the
was
from
its
nature
wholly
unfitted
to
contend
with
shore
batteries
the
general
who
at
this
time
was
quite
pacifically
inclined
may
have
thought
that
if
this
vessel
could
slip
in
and
land
its
cargo
unawares
he
would
have
secured
the
harbor
of
charleston
without
increasing
the
war
fever
in
the
south
be
this
as
it
may
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
policy
was
too
peaceful
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
when
a
company
of
the
most
distinguished
men
in
washington
was
formed
under
cassius
clay
to
prevent
the
capture
of
the
president
and
the
destruction
of
the
public
buildings
he
gave
positive
orders
to
senator
nye
who
was
on
duty
at
the
not
to
fire
upon
the
enemy
in
case
they
came
there
to
take
possession
the
original
plan
to
succor
us
was
excellent
the
substitute
was
an
utter
failure
a
change
of
this
kind
always
occasions
more
or
less
delay
and
in
the
present
instance
nearly
a
week
elapsed
before
the
vessel
left
new
york
the
enemy
took
immediate
advantage
of
the
time
thus
gained
to
put
up
a
work
to
control
the
main
channel
which
passes
by
morris
island
and
which
had
previously
been
wholly
unobstructed
they
received
the
telegraphic
notice
on
the
of
december
that
a
would
be
sent
and
the
very
next
day
the
cadets
of
the
citadel
academy
were
hard
at
work
at
the
new
battery
it
was
located
so
that
it
would
command
the
channel
and
at
the
same
time
be
beyond
the
reach
of
our
guns
the
day
was
cold
and
rainy
and
the
wind
blew
fiercely
we
wondered
how
long
those
boys
would
keep
up
their
enthusiasm
amidst
the
hardships
and
trials
of
the
real
war
which
was
now
fast
approaching
our
chaplain
who
had
been
present
at
the
raising
of
the
flag
and
had
then
returned
to
his
family
in
moultrieville
desired
to
make
us
another
visit
for
this
purpose
he
called
upon
the
rebel
commander
at
fort
moultrie
and
asked
if
there
would
be
any
obstacle
thrown
in
the
way
of
his
crossing
over
to
see
us
the
answer
was
oh
no
parson
i
think
i
will
give
you
a
pass
the
chaplain
replied
i
did
not
ask
you
for
a
pass
sir
i
am
a
united
states
officer
and
i
shall
visit
a
united
states
fort
whenever
i
think
proper
without
asking
your
permission
i
simply
desire
to
know
whether
you
intend
to
prevent
my
going
by
force
he
was
not
allowed
to
cross
and
as
he
soon
gave
new
proofs
of
contumacy
by
persisting
in
praying
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
when
asked
to
hold
services
in
the
chapel
before
the
rebel
soldiers
he
was
soon
banished
and
his
property
confiscated
the
ladies
we
had
left
behind
naturally
felt
a
to
be
with
us
once
more
my
wife
did
not
wish
to
ask
permission
of
the
rebel
authorities
and
i
saw
little
chance
of
her
coming
in
any
other
way
nevertheless
to
my
surprise
she
made
her
appearance
at
the
wharf
at
fort
sumter
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
january
it
seems
she
found
a
of
laborers
about
to
make
the
passage
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
their
back
pay
from
captain
foster
she
took
a
seat
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
told
them
to
take
her
with
them
the
sentinel
who
was
there
to
examine
the
passes
did
not
interfere
or
ask
her
any
questions
so
she
came
over
without
difficulty
foster
and
her
sister
smith
were
already
with
us
having
obtained
a
permit
from
the
governor
seymour
had
made
an
unsuccessful
application
to
the
commander
of
fort
moultrie
and
had
been
somewhat
rudely
refused
two
clever
little
boys
sons
of
our
sutler
dan
sinclair
volunteered
to
row
her
across
after
dark
they
pulled
a
boat
out
from
under
a
house
up
the
beach
and
as
there
was
no
guard
there
seymour
came
over
without
difficulty
the
ladies
were
desirous
of
remaining
an
indefinite
length
of
time
but
we
had
no
means
of
making
them
comfortable
and
major
anderson
thought
their
presence
would
merely
add
to
our
embarrassment
in
accordance
with
his
wishes
they
left
that
night
and
the
next
day
the
cold
was
intense
and
as
all
the
wood
was
retained
for
cooking
purposes
i
was
obliged
to
split
up
a
mahogany
table
for
fuel
to
keep
my
wife
from
suffering
during
her
brief
visit
she
and
seymour
went
back
with
the
sinclair
boys
at
midnight
they
succeeded
in
making
a
landing
and
in
reaching
the
chaplain
house
without
being
observed
in
the
mean
time
an
amusing
scene
had
occurred
there
a
very
chivalrous
gentleman
means
of
south
carolina
had
learned
in
some
way
that
seymour
had
been
rudely
refused
permission
to
visit
her
husband
in
fort
sumter
he
thought
this
action
of
the
commandant
of
fort
moultrie
harsh
and
unnecessary
and
was
kind
enough
to
take
the
trouble
to
call
at
the
chaplain
house
to
assure
seymour
that
he
would
procure
her
a
pass
from
higher
authority
the
chaplain
hardly
knew
how
to
act
he
did
not
like
to
tell
the
that
seymour
had
already
gone
for
fear
it
might
get
the
sinclair
boys
into
trouble
he
therefore
pretended
that
seymour
was
confined
to
her
room
with
a
the
sent
in
repeated
messages
to
beg
that
she
would
see
him
if
it
was
only
for
a
moment
but
the
answers
made
up
by
harris
were
invariably
in
the
negative
the
chaplain
afterward
laughed
heartily
at
the
equivocal
position
he
had
been
forced
to
assume
now
that
we
were
alone
once
more
we
went
to
work
with
a
will
the
baltimore
laborers
were
of
inestimable
value
they
did
an
immense
amount
of
labor
in
the
way
of
mounting
guns
and
moving
weighty
materials
from
one
part
of
the
work
to
another
but
they
showed
no
inclination
to
take
part
in
the
fighting
should
any
occur
on
the
the
south
carolina
commissioners
finally
shook
off
the
dust
from
their
feet
and
left
washington
having
utterly
failed
to
accomplish
the
object
of
their
mission
on
the
same
day
the
governor
through
gourdin
influence
permitted
us
to
receive
our
mails
once
more
by
this
date
we
had
mounted
all
the
guns
we
were
able
to
man
on
the
lower
tier
and
had
bricked
up
the
surplus
windows
and
embrasures
as
we
had
no
one
to
guard
them
the
enemy
in
the
mean
time
had
erected
a
battery
at
fort
johnson
and
marked
out
another
directly
opposite
to
us
in
moultrieville
on
the
the
mayor
of
new
york
fernando
wood
promulgated
a
message
to
the
effect
that
the
union
was
breaking
up
and
recommending
that
the
city
of
new
york
secede
from
the
state
at
this
time
the
seeming
indifference
of
the
politicians
to
our
fate
made
us
feel
like
orphan
children
of
the
republic
deserted
by
both
the
state
and
federal
administrations
on
the
same
day
governor
pickens
graciously
allowed
anderson
to
visit
her
husband
but
coupled
the
permission
with
the
ungenerous
stipulation
that
the
interview
must
take
place
in
presence
of
witnesses
he
disliked
very
much
to
disoblige
her
as
she
belonged
to
one
of
the
most
distinguished
families
of
georgia
and
had
many
influential
relatives
among
the
secessionists
gourdin
too
who
was
a
warm
personal
friend
of
her
husband
exerted
himself
in
her
behalf
while
she
herself
displayed
great
patriotism
several
of
her
brothers
in
the
final
attack
on
fort
sumter
were
on
the
opposite
side
fighting
against
her
husband
under
the
circumstances
her
visit
to
us
was
a
brief
one
she
brought
a
valuable
addition
to
the
fort
in
the
shape
of
peter
hart
a
gallant
and
trustworthy
man
who
had
been
anderson
orderly
sergeant
in
mexico
she
felt
much
easier
in
her
mind
now
that
the
major
had
hart
to
look
after
him
he
was
only
permitted
to
join
us
on
condition
that
his
duties
were
to
be
those
of
a
civilian
and
not
of
a
soldier
on
the
the
governor
who
like
louis
might
very
readily
have
said
moi
concluded
to
form
a
cabinet
to
assist
him
in
his
onerous
duties
he
accordingly
appointed
magrath
secretary
of
state
jamison
secretary
of
war
memminger
secretary
of
the
treasury
garlington
secretary
of
the
interior
and
harlee
on
the
same
day
our
ladies
who
had
assembled
at
the
mills
house
in
charleston
left
for
the
north
in
a
body
on
account
of
the
state
of
public
feeling
in
the
city
their
presence
with
us
threw
a
momentary
brightness
over
the
scene
but
after
their
departure
every
thing
looked
more
gloomy
and
disheartening
than
before
the
fort
itself
was
a
deep
dark
damp
place
inclosed
in
high
walls
where
the
sunlight
rarely
penetrated
if
we
ascended
to
the
parapet
we
saw
nothing
but
uncouth
state
flags
representing
palmettos
pelicans
and
other
strange
devices
no
echo
seemed
to
come
back
from
the
loyal
north
to
encourage
us
our
glasses
in
vain
swept
the
horizon
the
one
flag
we
longed
to
see
was
not
there
it
did
come
at
last
in
a
timid
apologetic
way
and
not
as
a
representative
of
the
war
power
of
the
government
we
had
seen
a
statement
in
a
northern
paper
that
a
steamer
named
the
of
the
which
belonged
to
marshall
roberts
was
to
be
sent
to
us
under
command
of
captain
john
with
a
of
several
hundred
men
and
supplies
of
food
and
ammunition
but
we
could
not
credit
the
rumor
to
publish
all
the
details
of
an
expedition
of
this
kind
which
ought
to
be
kept
a
profound
secret
was
virtually
telling
south
carolina
to
prepare
her
guns
to
sink
the
vessel
it
was
hard
to
believe
the
government
would
send
to
us
a
mercantile
steamer
a
mere
transport
utterly
unfitted
to
contend
with
shore
batteries
when
it
could
dispatch
a
furnished
with
all
the
means
and
appliances
to
repel
force
by
force
as
the
insurgents
at
this
period
had
but
few
and
a
very
scanty
supply
of
the
alone
in
my
opinion
could
have
gone
straight
to
the
wharf
in
charleston
and
have
put
an
end
to
the
insurrection
then
and
there
for
we
all
know
what
its
distinguished
captain
farragut
was
able
to
accomplish
when
left
to
his
own
resources
it
seems
however
the
news
was
literally
true
the
expedition
was
fitted
out
by
lieutenant
washington
bartlett
an
of
our
navy
although
i
had
little
faith
in
the
announcement
i
scanned
with
increased
interest
every
vessel
that
approached
the
harbor
soon
after
daylight
on
the
morning
of
the
i
was
on
the
parapet
with
my
for
i
fancied
from
a
signal
i
had
observed
the
previous
evening
on
a
that
something
must
be
coming
as
i
looked
seaward
i
saw
a
large
steamer
pass
the
bar
and
enter
the
morris
island
channel
it
had
the
ordinary
united
states
flag
up
and
as
it
evidently
did
not
belong
to
the
navy
i
came
to
the
conclusion
it
must
be
the
of
the
i
do
not
remember
that
any
other
officers
were
on
the
lookout
at
this
time
anderson
himself
was
still
in
bed
when
the
vessel
came
opposite
the
new
battery
which
had
just
been
built
by
the
cadets
i
saw
a
shot
fired
to
bring
her
to
soon
after
this
an
immense
united
states
was
run
up
at
the
fore
without
waiting
to
ascertain
the
result
of
the
firing
i
dashed
down
the
back
stairs
to
anderson
room
to
notify
him
of
the
occurrence
he
told
me
to
have
the
long
roll
beaten
and
to
post
the
men
at
the
guns
on
the
parapet
i
ran
out
called
the
drummers
and
had
the
alarm
sounded
it
took
but
a
few
minutes
for
men
and
officers
to
form
at
the
guns
in
readiness
for
action
the
battery
was
still
firing
but
the
transport
had
passed
by
and
was
rapidly
getting
out
of
range
at
the
same
time
it
was
approaching
within
of
fort
moultrie
the
latter
immediately
opened
fire
from
one
or
two
guns
anderson
would
not
allow
us
to
return
this
fire
and
the
captain
of
the
vessel
wholly
discouraged
by
our
failure
to
respond
turned
about
and
made
his
way
back
to
new
york
two
shots
had
struck
the
steamer
but
no
essential
injury
was
done
i
think
the
people
in
fort
moultrie
who
expected
to
be
driven
out
to
take
refuge
behind
the
were
especially
astonished
at
our
inaction
it
is
very
true
that
the
morris
island
battery
was
beyond
the
reach
of
our
guns
still
we
did
not
know
this
positively
at
the
time
and
our
firing
in
that
direction
even
if
ineffectual
would
have
encouraged
the
steamer
to
keep
on
its
course
we
had
one
or
two
guns
bearing
on
fort
moultrie
and
as
that
was
within
easy
range
we
could
have
kept
down
the
fire
there
long
enough
to
enable
the
steamer
to
come
in
it
was
plainly
our
duty
to
do
all
that
we
could
for
any
thing
we
knew
to
the
contrary
she
might
have
been
in
a
sinking
condition
had
she
gone
down
before
our
eyes
without
an
effort
on
our
part
to
aid
her
anderson
would
have
incurred
a
fearful
responsibility
by
his
inaction
dawson
in
his
account
of
these
incidents
in
the
has
it
that
a
council
of
war
was
held
by
us
to
determine
whether
we
would
fire
or
not
and
that
we
decided
not
to
fire
he
founds
this
upon
verbal
statements
made
by
foster
and
davis
i
know
foster
was
under
this
impression
but
upon
my
recalling
the
circumstances
to
his
recollection
a
short
time
before
his
death
he
admitted
his
mistake
my
memory
is
very
clear
and
distinct
on
this
point
and
i
am
sustained
in
regard
to
it
by
both
seymour
and
crawford
davis
i
have
not
seen
for
some
time
but
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
confirm
what
i
have
said
when
his
memory
is
refreshed
indeed
there
was
no
time
for
deliberation
while
the
troops
were
at
the
guns
for
the
vessel
was
moving
very
rapidly
and
the
whole
affair
was
over
in
a
few
minutes
the
council
was
held
after
the
steamer
had
gone
to
determine
what
action
ought
to
be
taken
in
consequence
of
the
attack
it
was
too
late
then
for
resistance
and
all
we
could
do
was
to
send
lieutenant
hall
to
the
governor
with
a
flag
of
truce
to
demand
an
explanation
in
this
communication
anderson
expressly
stated
that
if
he
did
not
receive
a
satisfactory
reply
he
would
not
hereafter
allow
any
vessel
from
charleston
to
pass
within
reach
of
his
guns
as
might
be
expected
the
governor
replied
that
he
took
the
responsibility
of
the
firing
and
would
do
it
again
under
like
circumstances
anderson
then
reconvened
the
council
to
lay
this
answer
before
them
through
his
influence
it
was
concluded
to
send
lieutenant
talbot
to
washington
with
a
full
statement
of
the
occurrence
and
await
his
return
with
specific
instructions
from
the
war
department
to
carry
out
even
this
programme
the
major
was
obliged
to
obtain
the
governor
permission
for
lieutenant
talbot
to
pass
through
charleston
it
was
urged
by
anderson
that
the
delay
would
enable
us
to
finish
our
preparations
for
defense
but
it
was
evident
that
time
was
far
more
valuable
to
the
enemy
than
it
was
to
us
for
it
enabled
them
to
complete
and
arm
their
batteries
and
close
the
harbor
against
our
thus
virtually
imprisoning
us
in
our
island
home
when
talbot
left
we
resumed
our
labors
as
usual
no
attempt
was
made
to
carry
out
the
threat
of
stopping
all
passing
vessels
by
the
of
january
our
heavy
guns
were
up
but
by
that
time
too
the
greater
part
of
fort
moultrie
and
castle
pinckney
were
shielded
from
our
direct
fire
by
huge
piles
of
we
now
began
to
get
out
of
fuel
but
we
still
had
a
resource
in
some
wooden
sheds
inside
the
fort
which
had
been
used
as
a
temporary
shelter
for
cement
and
building
materials
our
position
was
greatly
alleviated
in
one
respect
owing
it
is
said
to
the
influence
of
gourdin
already
referred
to
as
a
leading
secessionist
and
an
old
friend
of
major
anderson
we
were
allowed
to
receive
our
mails
once
more
after
the
of
the
affair
they
probably
thought
we
were
very
harmless
people
and
deserved
some
reward
for
our
forbearance
chapter
viii
a
resort
to
diplomacy
major
anderson
proposed
diplomatic
defensive
changes
in
the
anecdote
of
governor
battery
at
cummings
soldiers
families
a
threatening
confederate
visitors
to
the
organization
of
the
confederate
government
and
now
the
charleston
statesmen
concocted
a
plan
to
take
away
from
us
all
hope
of
succor
so
that
we
might
be
induced
to
surrender
to
this
end
they
determined
to
fill
up
the
entrance
of
the
harbor
by
depositing
stone
there
whether
they
really
intended
to
do
this
or
made
a
pretense
of
doing
it
i
never
knew
but
they
certainly
did
obtain
some
old
hulks
from
savannah
and
sunk
them
in
the
channel
either
these
hulks
were
deposited
in
the
wrong
places
or
else
the
tide
drifted
them
into
deep
water
for
it
is
certain
they
never
formed
any
impediment
to
navigation
afterward
perhaps
it
was
a
mere
de
to
intimidate
us
and
prevent
from
attempting
to
come
in
at
all
events
it
was
a
preliminary
to
a
grand
effort
to
negotiate
us
out
of
fort
sumter
for
this
purpose
two
representative
men
came
over
from
the
city
on
the
in
the
little
steamer
under
a
white
flag
the
party
consisted
of
the
late
united
states
district
judge
magrath
now
secretary
of
state
for
south
carolina
and
general
jamison
their
new
secretary
of
war
the
judge
who
was
the
champion
orator
of
the
state
made
a
long
and
eloquent
speech
the
purport
of
which
was
that
south
carolina
was
determined
to
have
fort
sumter
at
all
hazards
that
they
would
pull
it
down
with
their
if
they
could
not
get
it
in
any
other
way
that
the
other
southern
states
were
becoming
excited
on
the
subject
that
president
buchanan
was
in
his
dotage
that
the
government
in
washington
was
breaking
up
that
all
was
confusion
despair
and
disorder
there
and
that
it
was
full
time
for
us
to
look
out
for
our
own
safety
for
if
we
refused
to
give
up
the
fort
nothing
could
prevent
the
southern
troops
from
exterminating
us
he
ended
this
tragical
statement
by
saying
may
god
almighty
enable
you
to
come
to
a
just
decision
anderson
seemed
deeply
affected
at
the
prospect
of
hostilities
he
asked
them
why
they
did
not
first
attempt
diplomacy
instead
of
war
he
said
if
they
would
send
a
commissioner
to
lay
their
claims
before
the
authorities
at
washington
he
would
send
another
to
represent
the
condition
of
the
fort
and
the
government
could
then
form
its
own
judgment
and
come
to
some
decision
judge
magrath
replied
that
he
would
report
the
proposition
to
governor
pickens
for
his
action
he
and
his
companion
then
took
a
solemn
leave
of
us
and
returned
to
charleston
upon
reporting
the
facts
to
the
governor
it
was
at
once
decided
to
accept
anderson
proposition
they
gained
an
immense
advantage
in
so
doing
for
the
agreement
tied
the
hands
of
the
united
states
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
and
prevented
the
arrival
of
any
war
vessels
until
south
carolina
was
fully
prepared
to
receive
them
the
delay
gave
the
state
time
to
complete
and
man
its
batteries
and
to
obtain
an
unlimited
number
of
guns
and
quantities
of
shot
and
shell
from
the
cannon
foundry
at
richmond
virginia
known
as
the
tredegar
iron
works
thus
while
our
supplies
would
be
running
out
theirs
would
be
coming
in
every
day
delay
would
weaken
us
and
strengthen
them
i
was
strongly
opposed
to
this
fatal
measure
which
ultimately
cost
us
the
loss
of
fort
sumter
but
as
it
had
simply
emanated
from
anderson
himself
by
virtue
of
his
powers
as
commanding
officer
and
had
not
been
submitted
to
a
council
of
war
there
was
no
opportunity
for
protest
he
was
at
this
time
at
the
height
of
his
popularity
and
every
thing
he
did
was
sure
to
be
sustained
at
washington
in
this
embassy
colonel
isaac
hayne
an
eminent
lawyer
of
charleston
was
chosen
as
the
commissioner
from
south
carolina
and
lieutenant
norman
j
hall
was
sent
as
a
representative
of
fort
sumter
after
this
event
every
thing
went
on
for
a
while
as
usual
by
the
of
january
we
had
secured
the
main
gates
against
an
assault
by
building
a
wall
of
stone
and
mortar
behind
them
leaving
merely
what
is
called
a
for
the
entrance
of
one
person
at
a
time
even
this
was
covered
by
a
howitzer
loaded
with
canister
by
the
the
money
appropriated
by
the
south
carolina
legislature
for
war
purposes
amounted
to
and
was
soon
after
increased
to
there
was
not
a
dollar
in
the
treasury
and
nothing
but
the
bank
of
the
state
to
draw
upon
on
the
same
day
the
financial
condition
of
the
united
states
was
much
improved
by
the
appointment
of
john
dix
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
this
gave
great
confidence
to
the
moneyed
men
of
new
york
who
immediately
rallied
to
the
support
of
the
government
to
all
appearance
about
six
hundred
negroes
were
now
at
work
night
and
day
in
perfecting
the
defenses
of
fort
moultrie
the
enemy
continued
their
hostile
preparations
with
the
utmost
energy
and
zeal
in
spite
of
the
tacit
truce
which
was
supposed
to
exist
and
which
prevented
the
president
from
sending
to
aid
or
to
us
i
think
anderson
might
well
have
remonstrated
against
the
landing
of
additional
heavy
guns
and
mortars
on
sullivan
island
and
the
erection
or
new
batteries
to
be
used
against
us
he
should
at
once
have
reported
this
increased
activity
to
washington
in
order
that
the
agreement
might
be
terminated
or
at
least
limited
to
a
certain
number
of
days
on
the
judge
holt
was
nominated
as
secretary
of
war
and
was
soon
after
confirmed
by
the
senate
we
were
very
glad
to
have
an
energetic
and
patriotic
man
at
the
head
of
this
department
on
the
lieutenant
meade
left
us
for
his
home
in
richmond
virginia
in
consequence
of
a
dispatch
which
stated
that
his
mother
was
at
the
point
of
death
i
never
knew
whether
this
telegram
was
founded
on
fact
or
was
a
strategic
move
to
force
poor
meade
into
the
ranks
of
the
confederacy
by
detaching
him
temporarily
from
us
and
taking
him
where
tremendous
political
and
social
influences
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
he
had
previously
been
overwhelmed
with
letters
on
the
subject
he
was
already
much
troubled
in
mind
and
some
months
after
the
bombardment
of
fort
sumter
the
pressure
of
family
ties
induced
him
very
reluctantly
as
i
heard
to
join
the
disunionists
it
was
stated
that
he
never
was
a
happy
man
afterward
and
that
before
a
year
had
passed
death
put
an
end
to
his
sorrow
and
regret
he
was
the
son
of
meade
our
minister
to
brazil
the
troops
opposite
to
us
were
now
regularly
receiving
supplies
and
and
drilling
daily
while
all
the
necessaries
of
life
were
constantly
diminishing
with
us
we
were
already
out
of
sugar
soap
and
candles
on
the
lieutenant
talbot
returned
from
his
visit
to
washington
where
it
will
be
remembered
he
had
been
sent
to
explain
the
of
the
affair
and
ask
for
specific
instructions
which
would
relieve
anderson
from
the
responsibility
and
throw
it
upon
the
administration
the
orders
he
brought
back
were
to
the
effect
that
they
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
major
anderson
and
that
they
left
every
thing
to
his
judgment
this
was
throwing
the
responsibility
all
back
upon
him
it
was
very
complimentary
but
far
from
satisfactory
talbot
stated
that
he
had
great
difficulty
in
making
a
safe
transit
through
charleston
for
while
the
leaders
seemed
to
be
more
pacific
than
ever
the
populace
had
become
more
violent
it
was
even
thought
necessary
to
send
an
officer
with
him
to
secure
his
personal
safety
he
brought
me
the
pleasant
information
that
the
mob
were
howling
for
my
head
as
that
of
the
only
republican
or
as
they
called
it
black
republican
in
the
fort
many
unfavorable
comments
having
been
made
even
in
the
southern
states
more
particularly
in
kentucky
in
relation
to
governor
treatment
of
us
he
relaxed
his
severity
and
on
the
sent
us
over
some
fresh
beef
and
vegetables
as
if
we
would
consent
to
be
fed
by
the
charity
of
south
carolina
anderson
showed
a
good
deal
of
proper
spirit
on
this
occasion
he
declined
to
receive
the
provisions
but
notified
the
governor
that
if
we
were
not
interfered
with
we
would
purchase
our
own
supplies
in
charleston
market
the
governor
consented
to
this
but
nothing
came
of
it
there
seemed
to
be
a
combination
among
the
not
to
sell
us
any
food
indeed
this
action
of
the
governor
made
him
very
unpopular
with
the
rhett
faction
rhett
rushed
over
to
inform
him
that
the
people
demanded
that
fort
sumter
should
be
taken
without
any
further
procrastination
or
delay
the
governor
made
a
very
shrewd
reply
he
said
certainly
rhett
i
have
no
objection
i
will
furnish
you
with
some
men
and
you
can
storm
the
work
yourself
rhett
drew
back
and
replied
but
sir
i
am
not
a
military
man
nor
i
either
said
the
governor
and
therefore
i
take
the
advice
of
those
that
are
after
this
there
was
no
further
talk
of
an
immediate
assault
the
action
of
the
governor
in
this
case
almost
gained
him
the
reputation
of
a
wit
among
the
officers
of
his
command
lieutenant
hall
being
absent
on
diplomatic
duty
and
crawford
being
temporarily
and
lieutenant
talbot
permanently
on
the
the
rest
of
us
were
utterly
worn
out
with
the
labor
that
devolved
upon
us
guard
duty
was
especially
severe
as
increased
vigilance
became
necessary
in
consequence
of
certain
threatening
preparations
made
by
the
enemy
the
leaders
in
charleston
soon
saw
that
the
joint
mission
of
hall
and
hayne
could
not
possibly
result
in
any
thing
decisive
but
as
every
day
added
to
their
strength
and
resources
they
did
not
choose
to
recall
their
commissioner
they
left
him
to
continue
his
arguments
in
relation
to
the
right
of
eminent
domain
while
they
prepared
for
war
in
the
hope
that
some
day
they
might
take
us
by
surprise
they
had
the
which
still
patrolled
the
harbor
painted
black
and
all
the
lights
and
fires
carefully
screened
from
view
they
probably
intended
to
choose
a
dark
night
to
drop
down
noiselessly
with
the
tide
and
take
advantage
of
a
sleepy
sentinel
or
some
other
favorable
circumstance
to
land
a
party
on
the
rocks
at
the
base
of
the
wall
and
seize
the
main
entrance
or
make
their
way
in
through
one
of
the
embrasures
on
the
new
york
city
speaking
through
its
mayor
fernando
wood
seemed
to
offer
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
the
secessionists
certain
arms
which
had
been
purchased
by
georgia
to
be
used
against
the
general
government
were
detained
in
new
york
and
toombs
telegraphed
to
wood
for
an
explanation
the
latter
characterized
the
detention
as
an
outrage
for
which
he
was
not
responsible
and
for
which
he
would
inflict
summary
punishment
if
he
had
the
power
lieutenant
meade
returned
faithfully
on
the
but
brought
no
news
of
importance
on
the
anderson
applied
for
the
code
of
naval
signals
so
that
if
a
fleet
at
any
time
should
cross
the
bar
he
might
communicate
with
it
at
a
distance
up
to
the
we
had
not
been
able
to
procure
any
thing
to
eat
from
the
city
but
through
the
influence
of
gourdin
who
seemed
to
have
a
special
mission
to
smooth
over
all
difficulties
a
new
arrangement
was
made
by
which
our
provisions
were
ostensibly
purchased
for
fort
johnson
and
were
forwarded
to
us
from
there
the
nearest
land
to
us
was
called
cummings
point
it
was
nearly
opposite
the
gorge
which
was
the
weakest
side
of
fort
sumter
the
wall
there
being
thinner
than
in
any
other
part
the
enemy
now
began
to
build
the
most
formidable
of
all
their
batteries
on
the
point
referred
to
it
was
constructed
of
strong
timber
plated
with
railroad
iron
and
partially
covered
with
sand
when
finished
it
was
regarded
as
almost
impregnable
steamers
from
the
city
passed
within
a
of
us
daily
loaded
with
the
materials
used
in
its
construction
without
opposition
and
without
remonstrance
as
it
seemed
settled
that
we
were
to
wait
until
hayne
was
through
with
his
and
as
our
food
in
the
mean
time
was
rapidly
giving
out
anderson
on
the
directed
me
to
make
arrangements
with
the
authorities
of
charleston
to
enable
us
to
send
off
the
families
to
fort
hamilton
this
was
done
and
the
women
and
children
were
shipped
off
to
charleston
on
the
and
transferred
to
the
steamer
which
left
for
new
york
on
the
of
february
as
they
passed
the
fort
the
men
gave
them
repeated
cheers
as
a
farewell
and
displayed
much
feeling
for
they
thought
it
very
probable
they
might
not
meet
them
again
for
a
long
period
if
ever
on
the
arrival
of
these
families
at
fort
hamilton
new
york
they
found
themselves
in
straitened
circumstances
because
owing
to
our
isolation
the
men
had
not
been
paid
off
for
a
long
time
and
therefore
had
no
money
to
give
their
wives
plymouth
church
however
interested
itself
in
their
behalf
and
soon
made
them
comparatively
comfortable
had
our
government
been
really
disposed
at
this
period
to
act
with
ordinary
energy
it
might
have
opened
a
communication
with
us
and
cleared
the
morris
island
channel
without
much
difficulty
there
were
only
about
three
hundred
charleston
militia
guarding
the
batteries
on
that
island
and
it
would
have
been
easy
for
a
small
force
of
mariners
and
soldiers
to
land
there
in
the
night
take
the
batteries
in
reverse
and
drive
the
troops
out
or
capture
them
this
once
accomplished
and
supplies
could
have
been
sent
us
to
any
amount
buchanan
administration
however
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
his
only
desire
seemed
to
be
to
get
through
his
term
of
office
without
a
collision
leaving
the
difficulties
and
perplexities
of
his
position
as
a
legacy
to
his
successor
on
the
i
received
an
insulting
letter
from
charleston
informing
me
that
if
i
were
ever
caught
in
the
city
an
arrangement
had
been
made
to
tar
and
feather
me
as
an
abolitionist
february
had
now
arrived
the
of
the
month
was
made
memorable
by
the
meeting
of
the
peace
congress
at
washington
and
by
a
convention
to
represent
the
southern
states
at
montgomery
alabama
on
the
the
new
secretary
of
war
judge
holt
wrote
to
south
carolina
that
the
president
did
not
intend
to
inaugurate
any
aggressive
measures
and
if
the
state
government
attacked
fort
sumter
they
would
incur
a
fearful
responsibility
on
the
some
photographic
artists
were
allowed
to
come
over
and
take
our
portraits
in
a
group
i
think
it
proved
a
profitable
speculation
for
the
sale
was
quite
large
one
of
the
party
proved
afterward
to
be
a
lieutenant
of
a
charleston
company
it
seems
he
came
as
a
spy
and
no
doubt
thought
he
had
done
a
very
clever
thing
but
inasmuch
as
gourdin
and
other
secessionists
including
several
military
and
naval
officers
were
permitted
to
roam
through
the
fort
at
will
there
was
very
little
use
in
taking
precautions
against
spies
indeed
on
one
occasion
another
major
anderson
a
namesake
of
our
commander
came
down
to
charleston
with
a
loaded
with
shot
shell
heavy
guns
and
mortars
for
south
carolina
to
be
used
in
the

against
us
he
was
the
owner
of
the
celebrated
tredegar
iron
works
of
richmond
virginia
already
referred
to
and
had
been
enriched
by
the
patronage
of
the
united
states
i
thought
it
decidedly
cool
in
him
under
the
circumstances
to
come
over
to
call
on
our
major
anderson
he
made
no
attempt
at
concealment
but
stated
without
reserve
the
object
of
his
trip
to
the
south
to
my
surprise
instead
of
being
summarily
expelled
he
met
with
a
most
cordial
reception
was
invited
to
stay
to
dinner
and
when
he
left
he
was
dismissed
with
a
god
bless
you
you
have
such
a
thing
as
a
late
newspaper
about
you
have
you
on
the
of
february
the
enemy
batteries
were
completed
manned
and
ready
for
action
on
the
same
day
the
confederate
government
was
duly
organized
by
the
election
of
jefferson
davis
of
mississippi
as
president
and
alexander

as

of

and
charles

peter

beauregard
of
louisiana
was
made
to
command
the
provisional
army
by
this
time
we
had
finished
most
of
our
preparations
and
were
busily
engaged
in
constructing
a
mine
at
the
extremity
of
the
wharf
for
the
benefit
of
any
hostile
party
that
might
land

lieutenant
hall
returned
on
the
he
had
had
a
very
pleasant
time
in
washington
and
had
been
petted
a
good
deal
by
the
loyal
people
of
the
north
but
his
mission
proved
of
no
real
benefit
to
the
united
states
and
we
had
missed
him
a
great
deal
for
we
had
been
very
he
brought
nothing
definite
from
the
administration
all
the
latter
desired
was
to
have
a
peaceable
leaving
its
burdens
for
lincoln
shoulders
as
hall
passed
through
charleston
one
of
the
young
men
there
told
him
there
was
quite
a
revulsion
of
feeling
with
regard
to
attacking
fort
sumter
hall
inquired
the
reason
the
reply
was
that
a
schooner
which
had
just
come
in
had
been
in
great
danger
from
one
of
our
infernal
machines
which
had
exploded
and
whitened
the
water
for
three
hundred
yards
around
it
seems
that
seymour
who
is
very
ingenious
had
fastened
a
cannon
cartridge
in
the
centre
of
a
barrel
of
so
arranged
that
when
the
barrel
was
rolled
off
the
parapet
the
powder
would
explode
about
five
feet
from
the
base
of
the
wall
i
was
trying
the
experiment
one
day
as
the
schooner
passed
and
the
explosion
did
look
very
destructive
as
the
dashed
up
the
water
for
a
distance
of
fifty
feet
from
the
fort
on
the
we
had
two
more
mines
ready
for
any
storming
party
that
might
desire
to
land
about
this
time
captain
edward
of
charleston
who
had
formerly
been
very
intimate
with
the
officers
of
the
garrison
wrote
a
letter
urging
them
to
throw
off
their
allegiance
to
the
united
states
and
enter
into
the
confederate
service
no
one
took
the
trouble
to
answer

audacious
the
new

batteries
formal
notice
of
bombardment
we
saw
advertisements
now
in
the
northern
papers
showing
that
dramas
founded
on
our
occupation
of
fort
sumter
and
confinement
there
were
being
acted
both
in
boston
and
new
york
it
was
quite
amusing
to
see
our
names
in
the
and
to
find
that
persons
were
acting
our
parts
and
spouting
mock
heroics
on
the
stage
on
the
several
southern
senators
at
washington
wrote
to
governor
pickens
recommending
that
we
be
allowed
fresh
provisions
fuel
and
other
necessaries
at
the
same
time
expressing
their
sympathy
with
south
carolina
after
this
the
governor
became
more
polite
and
considerate
and
allowed
our
officers
to
send
to
purchase
oil
and
groceries
in
charleston
rhett
paper
of
course
bitterly
opposed
this
concession
we
now
learned
that
the
whole
question
of
fort
sumter
had
been
turned
over
to
the
new
southern
confederacy
for
solution
at
this
period
grievous
complaints
were
made
by
the
merchants
of
the
city
of
the
utter
stagnation
of
trade
all
the
business
had
fled
to
savannah
foreign
vessels
would
not
attempt
to
enter
a
harbor
where
civil
war
was
raging
especially
as
it
was
reported
that
obstructions
had
been
sunk
in
the
channel
the
charleston
people
said
they
now
fully
understood
and
appreciated
the
kindness
of
the
people
of
savannah
in
furnishing
them
with
old
hulks
to
destroy
the
harbor
of
charleston
when
the
organization
of
the
new
government
was
complete
the
original
secessionists
of
the
palmetto
state
were
exceedingly
angry
to
find
themselves
ignored
the
president
and
all
the
prominent
members
of
the
cabinet
with
the
single
exception
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
were
from
other
states
henceforward
instead
of
pretentious
leadership
the
position
of
south
carolina
was
to
be
that
of
humble
obedience
to
the
new
nor
was
this
their
only
grievance
free
trade
was
not
proclaimed
and
no
ordinance
was
passed
to
the
african
inasmuch
as
it
would
destroy
the
domestic
and
the
profits
of
in
virginia
it
was
soon
seen
that
the
associated
states
differed
widely
on
a
great
many
vital
points
one
of
these
related
to
indian
incursions
into
texas
the
border
states
owing
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
united
states
forces
desired
large
appropriations
in
money
for
the
purpose
of
organizing
troops
to
guard
the
settlements
from
indian
incursions
the
people
of
south
carolina
whose
burdens
were
already
very
great
and
who
were
advertising
in
vain
for
a
loan
were
very
unwilling
to
be
taxed
for
the
benefit
of
texas
and
arkansas
in
their
anger
at
these
untoward
events
the
proposition
was
freely
discussed
whether
it
would
not
be
the
best
course
to
secede
from
the
confederacy
altogether
and
place
themselves
under
a
british
protectorate
the
only
difficulty
in
the
way
seemed
to
be
the
unwillingness
of
great
britain
to
act
as
to
such
a
spoiled
child
as
south
carolina
virginia
had
not
yet
seceded
she
still
professed
neutrality
but
allowed
a
brisk
trade
in
cannon
and
ammunition
to
be
carried
on
with
the
south
knowing
they
were
to
be
used
against
the
general
government
anderson
now
expressed
himself
as
openly
opposed
to
coercion
he
was
in
favor
of
surrendering
all
the
forts
to
the
states
in
which
they
were
located
this
course
would
simply
be
an
acknowledgment
that
the
sovereignty
did
not
vest
in
the
united
states
and
would
have
led
to
nothing
but
disorder
and
disunion
he
said
if
his
native
state
kentucky
seceded
he
should
throw
up
his
commission
and
go
to
europe
the
fact
is
as
i
have
stated
he
was
a
strong
man
and
felt
bitterly
toward
the
north
for
not
carrying
out
the
fugitive
slave
law
he
contended
that
slavery
was
right
in
principle
and
expressly
sanctioned
by
the
bible
one
day
while
we
were
conversing
on
the
subject
i
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
slavery
in
ancient
times
was
not
founded
on
color
and
if
white
slavery
was
right
i
saw
no
reason
why
some
one
might
not
make
a
slave
of
him
and
read
texts
of
scripture
to
him
to
keep
him
quiet
he
was
unable
to
answer
this
argument
on
the
of
march
he
informed
the
general
government
that
he
had
no
doubt
we
would
soon
be
attacked
the
communication
however
led
to
no
comment
and
no
immediate
action
from
certain
circumstances
i
saw
that
south
carolina
not
only
intended
to
build
batteries
but
was
thinking
of
ships
to
sink
our
wooden
navy
and
at
some
future
time
capture
our
northern
harbors
i
was
so
much
impressed
with
the
importance
of
this
subject
that
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
call
attention
to
it
in
letters
to
curtis
of
missouri
and
other
members
of
congress
but
no
one
at
the
north
seemed
to
give
the
matter
a
second
thought
or
imagine
there
was
any
danger
to
be
apprehended
in
the
future
it
was
not
so
with
our
enemies
they
were
fully
alive
to
the
aggressive
power
it
would
give
them
and
they
commenced
to
experiment
by
building
an
floating
battery
which
was
to
be
plated
deep
enough
to
resist
our
heaviest
metal
when
finished
it
was
to
be
anchored
off
the
gorge
of
fort
sumter
so
that
it
could
beat
down
our
main
gates
and
make
wide
breaches
in
the
walls
for
an
assaulting
party
to
enter
this
battery
was
completed
on
the
of
march
but
the
state
militia
had
a
great
prejudice
against
it
and
could
not
be
induced
to
man
it
they
christened
it
the
slaughter
pen
and
felt
certain
it
would
go
to
the
bottom
the
moment
we
opened
fire
upon
it
out
of
deference
to
public
opinion
it
was
tied
up
to
the
wharf
in
moultrieville
and
took
part
from
that
position
in
the
final
bombardment
of
fort
sumter
the
eventful
of
march
had
now
arrived
and
with
it
a
new
president
representing
the
patriotism
and
vigor
of
the
great
we
looked
for
an
immediate
change
of
policy
but
it
was
some
weeks
before
any
definite
action
was
taken
with
regard
to
us
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
when
we
consider
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
employés
of
the
previous
administration
were
disloyal
and
treacherous
while
the
new
appointments
could
not
be
made
hastily
on
account
of
the
tremendous
pressure
for
office
and
the
difficulty
of
canvassing
the
claims
of
so
many
rival
and
influential
candidates
if
lincoln
wrote
a
private
dispatch
it
was
sure
to
be
betrayed
to
the
enemy
the
defection
in
the
civil
service
in
the
army
and
navy
was
so
great
that
if
he
gave
an
order
he
was
always
in
doubt
whether
it
would
be
faithfully
carried
out
general
cooper
who
was
of
the
army
and
the
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
of
the
was
himself
a
rebel
at
heart
and
soon
resigned
to
join
the
confederacy
enough
however
was
already
known
of
the
policy
of
the
administration
to
cause
great
uneasiness
in
charleston
the
feeling
there
was
very
gloomy
at
the
prospect
of
real
war
for
almost
every
one
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
new
president
would
not
attempt
coercion
but
would
simply
submit
to
the
dismemberment
of
the
country
and
make
the
best
terms
he
could
they
now
knew
they
would
be
obliged
to
face
the
storm
they
had
raised
and
they
already
foresaw
great
sufferings
and
sacrifices
in
the
future
on
the
anderson
wrote
to
washington
that
he
needed
no
the
fact
is
he
did
not
want
it
because
its
arrival
would
be
sure
to
bring
on
a
collision
and
that
was
the
one
thing
he
wished
to
avoid
lincoln
soon
after
appointed
simon
cameron
as
the
new
secretary
of
war
on
the
an
accidental
shot
fired
from
the
battery
opposite
struck
near
our
wharf
the
enemy
sent
a
boat
over
at
once
to
make
an
explanation
our
men
were
dissatisfied
that
the
affair
ended
in
nothing
they
were
becoming
thoroughly
angry
and
disgusted
at
their
long
confinement
and
at
the
supervision
south
carolina
exercised
over
them
one
and
all
desired
to
fight
it
out
as
soon
as
possible
after
consultation
with
major
anderson
it
was
deemed
impossible
at
washington
to
succor
us
without
sending
a
force
of
at
least
twenty
thousand
men
to
storm
the
batteries
on
morris
island
there
was
a
time
when
these
works
could
have
been
easily
captured
but
now
with
the
north
full
of
spies
any
attempt
to
take
them
by
force
would
have
called
out
all
the
available
strength
of
south
carolina
assisted
by
volunteers
from
other
states
on
the
it
was
everywhere
published
that
the
administration
intended
to
withdraw
us
but
no
admission
of
the
kind
could
be
obtained
from
mr
lincoln
learning
that
we
had
nothing
but
pork
and
hard
biscuit
to
eat
haight
a
wealthy
gentleman
of
new
york
sent
us
several
boxes
of
delicacies
the
governor
under
the
impression
we
were
soon
to
be
withdrawn
allowed
them
to
come
over
they
were
fully
appreciated
the
great
tobacconist
john
anderson
of
new
york
also
sent
a
large
supply
of
the
best
quality
of
tobacco
having
learned
that
the
men
felt
the
loss
of
their
smoking
more
than
any
thing
else
by
this
time
the
south
carolina
treasury
was
in
a
state
of
collapse
a
loan
for
six
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
was
freely
advertised
but
no
one
desired
to
invest
the
city
trade
however
began
to
be
quite
brisk
again
from
the
immense
influx
of
sympathizing
strangers
that
poured
into
the
city
to
see
the
preparations
for
war
goods
too
began
to
come
in
from
all
quarters
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
prosperity
on
the
lay
one
of
general
scott
aids
who
had
resigned
on
the
of
the
month
came
down
to
offer
his
services
to
governor
pickens
he
must
have
had
in
his
possession
much
valuable
military
and
diplomatic
information
to
which
his
late
confidential
position
had
given
him
access
on
the
another
messenger
captain
fox
united
states
navy
came
over
to
see
us
captain
hartstein
who
was
an
of
our
navy
and
an
old
friend
of
fox
was
sent
with
him
to
be
within
and
see
that
he
did
no
harm
to
the
confederacy
fox
had
an
excellent
plan
of
his
own
in
reference
to
us
and
came
to
reconnoitre
and
ascertain
whether
it
was
practicable
to
carry
it
out
for
the
president
had
now
fully
determined
not
to
withdraw
us
or
surrender
fort
sumter
without
an
effort
to
hold
and
it
indeed
there
came
up
an
indignant
roar
from
the
great
and
many
parts
of
the
north
that
could
not
be
disregarded
with
impunity
to
have
done
so
would
almost
have
created
a
revolution
i
was
struck
by
one
modest
question
which
hartstein
put
to
me
on
this
occasion
he
asked
if
i
thought
anderson
would
object
to
his
anchoring
the
within
a
hundred
yards
of
our
main
gates
upon
my
expressing
my
surprise
at
such
an
audacious
proposal
he
replied
anderson
has
allowed
these
batteries
to
be
built
around
him
and
has
permitted
so
many
things
to
be
done
that
i
do
see
why
he
should
not
go
a
step
farther
and
allow
this
on
the
we
learned
that
beauregard
had
assumed
command
of
the
forces
opposite
to
us
as
he
had
just
left
our
army
where
he
had
been
highly
trusted
and
honored
it
is
said
he
displayed
a
good
deal
of
feeling
at
finding
himself
opposed
to
the
flag
under
which
he
had
served
so
long
he
expressed
much
sympathy
for
his
old
friend
anderson
who
he
stated
was
merely
fulfilling
his
duty
as
a
soldier
in
fighting
for
his
own
government
and
asserted
that
he
would
not
attack
us
even
if
we
withdrew
all
our
sentinels
but
would
force
us
to
surrender
by
cutting
off
our
supplies
on
the
we
had
but
two
days
regular
fuel
left
but
we
had
contrived
to
secure
and
utilize
a
number
of
floating
logs
as
they
passed
the
fort
and
these
increased
the
amount
on
hand
to
some
extent
anderson
now
had
no
doubt
that
we
would
be
withdrawn
and
the
papers
all
gave
out
the
same
idea
under
these
circumstances
as
we
were
out
of
fuel
and
had
a
large
number
of
surplus
on
hand
which
we
could
not
possibly
use
and
which
would
inevitably
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
when
we
left
i
suggested
that
it
would
be
good
policy
to
use
them
for
especially
as
many
of
them
were
decayed
and
worthless
he
would
not
however
consent
to
this
perhaps
he
thought
fuel
at
six
hundred
dollars
a
cord
was
rather
dear
the
result
was
that
they
were
finally
all
turned
over
to
the
confederacy
with
the
other
public
property
on
hand
on
the
colonel
ward
lamon
the
former
of
lincoln
came
over
to
visit
us
under
charge
of
colonel
duryea
of
charleston
it
was
given
out
that
he
was
sent
as
an
agent
of
the
general
government
to
see
governor
pickens
in
relation
to
matters
but
in
reality
he
came
to
confer
with
anderson
and
ascertain
the
amount
of
provisions
on
hand
he
took
with
him
the
important
information
that
our
food
would
be
out
by
the
middle
of
april
on
the
beauregard
sent
a
message
of
some
kind
to
anderson
i
do
not
know
its
purport
the
latter
stated
to
us
that
he
expected
decisive
orders
from
washington
on
the
but
none
came
the
of
april
arrived
and
as
the
heavy
work
of
mounting
guns
was
completed
our
commander
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
send
off
the
hired
laborers
and
he
intrusted
captain
foster
to
ask
permission
of
the
rebel
authorities
to
allow
them
to
land
the
request
was
granted
and
all
left
with
the
exception
of
a
few
who
desired
to
remain
with
us
and
share
our
fortunes
among
them
was
william
lyman
the
principal
overseer
of
the
masons
a
brave
and
reliable
man
on
the
of
april
another
affair
occurred
similar
to
that
of
the
of
the
the
schooner
of
boston
under
captain
mounts
for
savannah
with
a
cargo
of
ice
sailed
into
the
harbor
of
charleston
on
account
of
a
fog
as
the
captain
did
not
read
the
papers
he
did
not
know
that
any
thing
unusual
was
going
on
a
battery
on
morris
island
fired
a
shot
across
the
bow
of
his
vessel
to
bring
her
to
very
much
astonished
at
this
proceeding
he
ran
up
the
stars
and
stripes
to
show
that
he
was
all
right
this
was
regarded
as
a
direct
defiance
and
a
heavy
cannonade
was
at
once
opened
on
the
vessel
very
much
puzzled
to
account
for
this
hostility
he
lowered
his
flag
and
the
firing
ceased
a
boat
crew
now
put
off
from
the
shore
to
ascertain
his
character
and
purpose
in
entering
the
harbor
while
this
was
going
on
we
were
formed
at
our
guns
in
readiness
to
fire
but
were
not
allowed
to
do
so
although
there
was
every
probability
that
the
vessel
would
be
sunk
before
our
eyes
it
is
true
we
could
not
have
reached
the
particular
battery
that
was
doing
the
mischief
but
the
other
works
of
the
enemy
were
all
under
our
guns
and
not
expecting
immediate
action
were
in
a
measure
unprepared
anderson
however
contented
himself
with
sending
seymour
and
snyder
over
in
a
boat
with
a
white
flag
to
ask
for
an
explanation
with
the
usual
result
lieutenant
talbot
and
lieutenant
snyder
were
then
sent
over
to
have
an
interview
with
the
governor
in
relation
to
this
matter
this
being
far
from
satisfactory
lieutenant
snyder
returned
to
fort
sumter
and
lieutenant
talbot
kept
on
his
way
to
washington
with
dispatches
although
this
affair
attracted
very
little
attention
or
comment
at
the
north
i
was
convinced
from
the
major
depression
of
spirits
that
it
acted
a
great
deal
upon
his
mind
he
evidently
feared
it
might
be
considered
as
a
betrayal
of
his
trust
and
he
was
very
sensitive
to
every
thing
that
affected
his
honor
i
have
already
stated
the
reasons
for
his
inaction
in
amplifying
his
instructions
not
to
provoke
a
collision
into
instructions
not
to
fight
at
all
i
have
no
doubt
he
thought
he
was
rendering
a
real
service
to
the
country
he
knew
the
first
shot
fired
by
us
would
light
the
flames
of
a
civil
war
that
would
convulse
the
world
and
tried
to
put
off
the
evil
day
as
long
as
possible
yet
a
better
analysis
of
the
situation
might
have
taught
him
that
the
contest
had
already
commenced
and
could
no
longer
be
avoided
the
leaders
of
the
south
at
this
period
would
hardly
have
been
satisfied
with
the
most
abject
submission
of
the
party
to
all
their
behests
in
fact
every
concession
made
to
their
wishes
seemed
to
them
to
be
dictated
by
the
weakness
of
the
government
and
its
fears
of
internal
dissensions
and
civil
war
in
all
the
great
cities
of
the
north
they
needed
blood
and
the
prestige
of
a
victory
to
rouse
the
enthusiasm
of
their
followers
and
cement
the
rising
confederacy
they
wanted
a
new
and
powerful
slave
empire
extending
to
the
isthmus
of
panama
and
for
this
a
direct
issue
must
be
made
with
the
free
states
in
vain
did
a
member
of
congress
who
afterward
became
a
distinguished
union
general
offer
in
richmond
to
raise
an
army
of
twenty
thousand
men
in
the
north
to
fight
the
abolitionists
if
the
south
would
consent
to
remain
in
the
union
even
this
was
not
deemed
sufficient
or
satisfactory
slavery
had
so
long
dominated
every
thing
with
a
rod
of
iron
that
its
votaries
deemed
it
was
born
to
universal
dominion
all
the
pathways
to
political
power
all
the
avenues
of
promotion
in
the
army
and
navy
lay
in
that
direction
general
scott
was
accustomed
to
say
that
with
virginia
officers
and
yankee
troops
he
could
conquer
the
world
and
this
implied
that
in
his
opinion
were
the
only
men
fitted
to
command
washington
was
too
full
of
spies
for
the
rebel
leaders
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
lincoln
intention
to
us
on
the
of
april
beauregard
restricted
our
marketing
to
two
days
in
the
week
on
the
it
was
wholly
cut
off
and
we
noticed
gangs
of
negroes
hard
at
work
strengthening
the
defenses
on
morris
island
every
thing
betokened
that
the
conflict
would
soon
take
place
anderson
was
greatly
troubled
at
the
failure
of
all
his
plans
to
keep
the
place
the
rebels
knew
and
perhaps
he
knew
that
on
the
and
of
april
a
number
of
naval
vessels
had
left
new
york
and
norfolk
under
sealed
orders
their
destination
could
hardly
be
doubted
lieutenant
talbot
reached
washington
on
the
but
was
immediately
sent
back
with
a
message
from
the
president
to
governor
pickens
notifying
the
latter
that
the
government
intended
to
provision
fort
sumter
at
all
hazards
this
formal
notice
was
given
by
the
president
probably
because
he
considered
himself
bound
to
do
so
before
putting
an
end
to
the
code
which
had
governed
intercourse
with
the
forces
around
him
ever
since
the
departure
of
hall
and
hayne
for
washington
talbot
delivered
his
message
on
the
beauregard
immediately
telegraphed
the
information
to
the
rebel
secretary
of
war
at
montgomery
alabama
and
received
orders
on
the
to
open
fire
at
once
upon
fort
sumter
i
think
it
was
on
the
that
the
official
letter
came
notifying
anderson
that
a
naval
expedition
had
been
sent
to
our
relief
and
that
he
must
with
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
communicated
this
information
to
us
on
the
but
desired
it
should
be
kept
secret
the
preparations
we
were
obliged
to
make
told
the
men
plainly
enough
however
that
the
fighting
was
about
to
commence
the
news
acted
like
magic
upon
them
they
had
previously
been
drooping
and
dejected
but
they
now
sprung
to
their
work
with
the
greatest
alacrity
laughing
singing
whistling
and
full
of
glee
they
were
overjoyed
to
learn
that
their
long
imprisonment
in
the
fort
would
soon
be
at
an
end
they
had
felt
themselves
humiliated
by
the
open
supervision
which
south
carolina
exercised
over
us
and
our
tame
submission
to
it
it
was
very
galling
to
them
to
see
the
which
had
been
stolen
from
the
united
states
anchored
within
a
stone
cast
of
our
walls
to
watch
our
movements
and
overhaul
every
thing
coming
to
or
going
from
the
fort
including
our
on
the
beauregard
announced
his
personal
staff
to
consist
of
colonels
wigfall
chestnut
means
manning
and
boyleston
on
the
same
day
a
house
directly
opposite
to
us
in
moultrieville
at
the
nearest
point
was
suddenly
removed
disclosing
a
formidable
masked
battery
which
effectually
enfiladed
two
rows
of
our
upper
tier
of
guns
in
barbette
and
took
a
third
tier
in
reverse
it
was
a
sad
surprise
to
us
for
we
had
our
heaviest
metal
there
i
set
to
work
immediately
to
construct
traverses
but
it
was
difficult
to
make
much
progress
as
we
had
no
bags
and
were
obliged
to
tear
up
sheets
for
the
purpose
and
have
the
pieces
sewed
together
this
labor
however
was
entirely
thrown
away
for
anderson
ordered
us
to
abandon
all
the
guns
on
the
parapet
this
of
course
was
much
less
dangerous
for
the
men
but
it
deprived
us
of
the
most
powerful
and
effective
part
of
our
armament
about
of
the
same
day
a
boat
came
over
with
colonel
james
chestnut
states
senator
and
captain
stephen
lee
both
aids
of
beauregard
they
bore
a
demand
for
the
surrender
of
the
fort
anderson
politely
declined
to
accede
to
this
request
but
stated
in
conversation
he
would
soon
be
starved
out
this
gratuitous
information
ought
never
to
have
been
given
to
the
enemy
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
naval
expedition
was
on
its
way
to
us
it
was
at
once
supposed
that
anderson
desired
to
surrender
without
fighting
and
about
another
boat
came
over
containing
colonel
chestnut
colonel
pryor
and
captain
lee
to
inquire
upon
what
day
he
would
be
willing
to
evacuate
the
work
in
case
he
was
not
attacked
the
answer
was
on
the
at
noon
provided
he
did
not
receive
fresh
instructions
or
was
not
relieved
before
that
time
as
we
had
pork
enough
on
hand
to
last
for
two
weeks
longer
there
was
no
necessity
for
fixing
so
early
a
day
it
left
too
little
margin
for
naval
operations
as
in
all
probability
the
vessels
in
case
of
any
accident
or
detention
would
arrive
too
late
to
be
of
service
this
proved
to
be
the
case
the
enemy
batteries
on
sullivan
island
were
so
placed
as
to
fire
directly
into
the
officers
quarters
at
fort
sumter
and
as
our
rooms
would
necessarily
become
untenable
we
vacated
them
and
chose
points
that
were
more
secure
i
moved
my
bed
into
a
magazine
which
was
directly
opposite
to
cummings
point
and
which
was
nearly
empty
as
i
was
sensible
that
the
next
three
days
would
call
for
great
physical
exertion
and
constant
wakefulness
i
endeavored
to
get
all
the
sleep
i
could
on
the
night
of
the
about
on
the
i
was
awakened
by
some
one
groping
about
my
room
in
the
dark
and
calling
out
my
name
it
proved
to
be
anderson
who
came
to
announce
to
me
that
he
had
just
received
a
dispatch
from
beauregard
dated
to
the
effect
that
he
should
open
fire
upon
us
in
an
hour
finding
it
was
determined
not
to
return
the
fire
until
after
breakfast
i
remained
in
bed
as
we
had
no
lights
we
could
in
fact
do
nothing
before
that
time
except
to
wander
around
in
the
darkness
and
fire
without
an
accurate
view
of
the
enemy
works

terrific
conflagration
as
soon
as
the
outline
of
our
fort
could
be
distinguished
the
enemy
carried
out
their
programme
it
had
been
arranged
as
a
special
compliment
to
the
venerable
edmund
ruffin
who
might
almost
be
called
the
father
of
secession
that
he
should
fire
the
first
shot
against
us
from
the
stevens
battery
on
cummings
point
and
i
think
in
all
the
histories
it
is
stated
that
he
did
so
but
it
is
attested
by
crawford
and
others
who
were
on
the
parapet
at
the
time
that
the
first
shot
really
came
from
the
mortar
battery
at
fort
johnson
almost
immediately
afterward
a
ball
from
cummings
point
lodged
in
the
magazine
wall
and
by
the
sound
seemed
to
bury
itself
in
the
masonry
about
a
foot
from
my
head
in
very
unpleasant
proximity
to
my
right
ear
this
is
the
one
that
probably
came
with
ruffin
compliments
in
a
moment
the
firing
burst
forth
in
one
continuous
roar
and
large
patches
of
both
the
exterior
and
interior
masonry
began
to
crumble
and
fall
in
all
directions
the
place
where
i
was
had
been
used
for
the
manufacture
of
cartridges
and
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
powder
there
some
packed
and
some
loose
a
shell
soon
struck
near
the
ventilator
and
a
puff
of
dense
smoke
entered
the
room
giving
me
a
strong
impression
that
there
would
be
an
immediate
explosion
fortunately
no
sparks
had
penetrated
inside
nineteen
batteries
were
now
hammering
at
us
and
the
balls
and
shells
from
the
columbiads
accompanied
by
shells
from
the
mortars
which
constantly
bombarded
us
made
us
feel
as
if
the
war
had
commenced
in
earnest
when
it
was
broad
daylight
i
went
down
to
breakfast
i
found
the
officers
already
assembled
at
one
of
the
long
tables
in
the
our
party
were
calm
and
even
somewhat
merry
we
had
retained
one
colored
man
to
wait
on
us
he
was
a
mulatto
from
charleston
very
active
and
efficient
on
ordinary
occasions
but
now
completely
demoralized
by
the
thunder
of
the
guns
and
crashing
of
the
shot
around
us
he
leaned
back
against
the
wall
almost
white
with
fear
his
eyes
closed
and
his
whole
expression
one
of
perfect
despair
our
meal
was
not
very
sumptuous
it
consisted
of
pork
and
water
but
crawford
triumphantly
brought
forth
a
little
farina
which
he
had
found
in
a
corner
of
the
hospital
when
this
frugal
repast
was
over
my
company
was
told
off
in
three
details
for
firing
purposes
to
be
relieved
afterward
by
company
as
i
was
the
ranking
officer
i
took
the
first
detachment
and
marched
them
to
the
casemates
which
looked
out
upon
the
powerful
battery
of
cummings
point
in
aiming
the
first
gun
fired
against
the
rebellion
i
had
no
feeling
of
for
i
fully
believed
that
the
contest
was
inevitable
and
was
not
of
our
seeking
the
united
states
was
called
upon
not
only
to
defend
its
sovereignty
but
its
right
to
exist
as
a
nation
the
only
alternative
was
to
submit
to
a
powerful
oligarchy
who
were
determined
to
make
freedom
forever
subordinate
to
slavery
to
me
it
was
simply
a
contest
politically
speaking
as
to
whether
virtue
or
vice
should
rule
my
first
shot
bounded
off
from
the
sloping
roof
of
the
battery
opposite
without
producing
any
apparent
effect
it
seemed
useless
to
attempt
to
silence
the
guns
there
for
our
metal
was
not
heavy
enough
to
batter
the
work
down
and
every
ball
glanced
harmlessly
off
except
one
which
appeared
to
enter
an
embrasure
and
twist
the
iron
shutter
so
as
to
stop
the
firing
of
that
particular
gun
i
observed
that
a
group
of
the
enemy
had
ventured
out
from
their
intrenchments
to
watch
the
effect
of
their
fire
but
i
sent
them
flying
back
to
their
shelter
by
the
aid
of
a
ball
which
appeared
to
strike
right
in
among
them
crawford
having
no
sick
in
hospital
volunteered
to
take
command
of
one
of
the
detachments
he
and
lieutenant
davis
were
detailed
at
the
same
time
with
me
and
i
soon
heard
their
guns
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fort
echoing
my
own
they
attacked
fort
moultrie
with
great
vigor
our
firing
now
became
regular
and
was
answered
from
the
rebel
guns
which
encircled
us
on
the
four
sides
of
the
pentagon
upon
which
the
fort
was
built
the
other
side
faced
the
open
sea
showers
of
balls
from
columbiads
and
and
shells
from
mortars
poured
into
the
fort
in
one
incessant
stream
causing
great
flakes
of
masonry
to
fall
in
all
directions
when
the
immense
mortar
shells
after
sailing
high
in
the
air
came
down
in
a
vertical
direction
and
buried
themselves
in
the
their
explosion
shook
the
fort
like
an
earthquake
our
own
guns
were
very
defective
as
they
had
no
in
place
of
these
seymour
and
myself
were
obliged
to
devise
notched
sticks
which
answered
the
purpose
but
were
necessarily
very
imperfect
our
fort
had
been
built
with
reference
to
the
penetration
of
shot
when
the
old
system
of
guns
prevailed
the
balls
from
a
new
blakely
gun
on
cummings
point
however
had
force
enough
to
go
entirely
through
the
wall
which
sheltered
us
and
some
of
the
fragments
of
brick
which
were
knocked
out
wounded
several
of
my
detachment
none
were
seriously
hurt
except
sergeant
thomas
kirnan
of
my
company
his
contusions
were
severe
but
did
not
keep
him
out
of
the
fight
after
three
hours
firing
my
men
became
exhausted
and
captain
seymour
came
with
a
fresh
detachment
to
relieve
us
he
has
a
great
deal
of
humor
in
his
composition
and
said
jocosely
doubleday
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
here
and
what
is
all
this
uproar
about
i
replied
there
is
a
trifling
difference
of
opinion
between
us
and
our
neighbors
opposite
and
we
are
trying
to
settle
it
very
well
he
said
do
you
wish
me
to
take
a
hand
i
said
yes
i
would
like
to
have
you
go
in
all
right
he
said
what
is
your
elevation
and
range
i
replied
five
degrees
and
twelve
hundred
yards
well
he
said
here
goes
and
he
went
to
work
with
a
will
part
of
the
fleet
was
visible
outside
the
bar
about
ten
it
exchanged
salutes
with
us
but
did
not
attempt
to
enter
the
harbor
or
take
part
in
the
battle
in
fact
it
would
have
had
considerable
difficulty
in
finding
the
channel
as
the
marks
and
buoys
had
all
been
taken
up
it
was
composed
originally
of
the
frigates
under
commodore
rowan
the
under
captain
gillis
the
under
captain
mercer
the
steam
transport
under
captain
fletcher
and
i
believe
the
and
another
which
was
not
permitted
to
leave
new
york
the
soldiers
on
board
consisted
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
recruits
from
island
under
command
of
first
lieutenants
hudson
of
the
fourth
and
robert
tyler
of
the
third
artillery
and
second
lieutenant
thomas
of
the
first
infantry
this
expedition
was
designed
by
captain
fox
in
consultation
with
blunt
william
aspinwall
russel
sturges
and
others
after
the
event
much
obloquy
was
thrown
upon
the
navy
because
it
did
not
come
in
and
engage
the
numerous
batteries
and
forts
and
open
for
itself
a
way
to
charleston
but
this
course
would
probably
have
resulted
in
the
sinking
of
every
vessel
as
far
back
as
december
i
had
written
to
new
york
that
it
was
very
difficult
for
a
gun
on
shore
to
hit
a
small
boat
dancing
on
the
waves
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
it
is
almost
impossible
i
suggested
therefore
that
we
might
be
and
provisioned
by
means
of
a
number
of
small
boats
supplied
from
several
naval
vessels
as
a
base
of
operations
the
same
idea
had
occurred
to
captain
fox
and
on
the
present
occasion
he
had
brought
thirty
launches
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
they
were
to
be
manned
by
three
hundred
sailors
and
in
case
they
were
assailed
the
fleet
was
to
protect
them
as
far
as
possible
by
its
guns
unfortunately
the
different
vessels
did
not
reach
the
rendezvous
together
the
and
arrived
on
the
but
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
in
waiting
for
the
which
contained
the
launches
and
other
arrangements
without
which
a
boat
expedition
could
not
be
organized
the
never
appeared
having
been
unexpectedly
detached
by
order
of
the
president
at
the
solicitation
of
secretary
seward
and
without
consultation
with
the
navy
department
i
think
the
was
detained
by
running
upon
rattlesnake
shoal
the
was
driven
into
wilmington
by
a
storm
and
the
did
not
make
its
appearance
until
the
the
expedition
was
thus
an
utter
failure
nevertheless
a
passing
schooner
was
purchased
and
loaded
up
with
provisions
and
soldiers
and
an
attempt
would
have
been
made
to
run
in
on
the
night
of
the
but
by
that
time
it
was
too
late
the
fort
had
surrendered
having
explained
this
matter
we
will
now
resume
the
narrative
of
our
operations
for
the
next
three
hours
a
vigorous
fire
was
kept
up
on
both
sides
a
great
many
shots
were
aimed
at
our
but
nearly
all
of
them
passed
above
the
fort
and
struck
in
the
water
beyond
i
think
we
succeeded
in
silencing
several
guns
in
fort
moultrie
and
one
or
more
in
the
stevens
battery
when
seymour
three
hours
were
up
i
relieved
him
and
continued
the
firing
as
our
balls
bounded
off
the
sloping
iron
rails
like
peas
upon
a
trencher
utterly
failing
to
make
any
impression
and
as
the
shot
from
the
blakely
gun
came
clear
through
our
walls
anderson
directed
that
the
men
should
cease
firing
at
that
particular
place
i
regretted
very
much
that
the
upper
tier
of
guns
had
been
abandoned
as
they
were
all
loaded
and
pointed
and
were
of
very
heavy
calibre
a
wild
irish
soldier
however
named
john
carmody
slipped
up
on
the
parapet
and
without
orders
fired
the
pieces
there
one
after
another
on
his
own
account
one
of
the
balls
so
aimed
made
quite
an
impression
on
the
cummings
point
battery
and
if
the
fire
could
have
been
kept
up
it
might
possibly
have
knocked
the
to
pieces
after
my
detachment
had
abandoned
the
casemate
opposite
the
blakely
gun
to
my
great
astonishment
the
battery
i
had
left
recommenced
firing
i
could
not
imagine
who
could
have
taken
our
places
it
seems
that
a
group
of
the
baltimore
workmen
had
been
watching
our
motions
and
had
thus
learned
the
duties
of
a
cannoneer
in
spite
of
their
previous
determination
not
to
take
part
in
the
fight
they
could
not
resist
the
fun
of
trying
their
hand
at
one
of
the
guns
it
was
already
accurately
pointed
and
the
ball
struck
the
mark
in
the
centre
the
men
attributed
it
to
their
own
skill
and
when
i
entered
they
were
fairly
in
convulsions
of
laughter
one
of
them
in
answer
to
my
question
gasped
out
i
hit
it
square
in
the
middle
after
this
first
attempt
each
of
them
was
desirous
of
trying
his
skill
at
aiming
the
result
was
that
we
soon
had
them
organized
into
a
finding
one
of
my
chests
had
been
left
in
the
officers
quarters
and
that
it
would
probably
be
knocked
to
pieces
by
the
shells
i
asked
the
mulatto
who
still
sat
back
against
the
wall
apparently
asleep
to
bear
a
hand
and
help
me
bring
it
out
he
opened
his
eyes
shook
his
head
dolefully
and
said
de
major
he
say
i
muss
not
expose
myself
if
i
mistake
not
roswell
ripley
formerly
a
brevet
major
in
our
army
fired
the
second
or
third
shot
to
bring
down
the
flag
under
which
he
had
served
for
so
many
years
ripley
was
born
in
ohio
appointed
from
new
york
and
educated
at
the
military
academy
he
had
therefore
even
on
the
southern
theory
of
state
rights
no
necessary
affiliation
with
the
south
in
fact
they
always
despised
a
man
who
joined
them
to
fight
against
his
own
state
in
one
instance
jeff
davis
himself
had
to
use
all
his
influence
to
induce
the
southern
troops
to
obey
one
of
these
northern
generals
ripley
had
previously
been
engaged
as
an
agent
for
sharpe
arms
company
in
europe
and
having
been
unsuccessful
there
came
to
charleston
with
the
hope
of
repairing
his
shattered
fortunes
by
selling
guns
to
south
carolina
through
the
influence
of
colonel
huger
of
our
ordnance
department
who
was
in
the
city
at
the
time
ripley
failed
in
this
and
being
entirely
out
of
employment
accepted
a
commission
from
the
confederacy
to
fight
against
his
old
comrades
being
a
man
of
talent
and
a
skillful
artillerist
he
did
us
a
great
deal
of
harm
like
all
northern
converts
he
thought
it
necessary
to
be
overzealous
in
his
new
position
to
do
away
with
the
suspicions
excited
by
his
birth
and
education
i
was
told
at
the
time
that
for
this
purpose
he
took
pains
to
denounce
me
as
an
abolitionist
and
to
recommend
that
i
be
hanged
by
the
populace
as
soon
as
caught
the
firing
continued
all
day
without
any
special
incident
of
importance
and
without
our
making
much
impression
on
the
enemy
works
they
had
a
great
advantage
over
us
as
their
fire
was
concentrated
on
the
fort
which
was
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
while
ours
was
diffused
over
the
circumference
their
missiles
were
exceedingly
destructive
to
the
upper
exposed
portion
of
the
work
but
no
essential
injury
was
done
to
the
lower
casemates
which
sheltered
us
some
of
these
shells
however
set
the
officers
quarters
on
fire
three
times
but
the
flames
were
promptly
extinguished
once
or
twice
through
the
exertions
of
peter
hart
whose
activity
and
gallantry
were
very
conspicuous
the
night
was
an
anxious
one
for
us
for
we
thought
it
probable
that
the
launches
filled
with
armed
men
from
the
fleet
might
take
advantage
of
the
darkness
to
come
in
with
provisions
and
supplies
then
too
it
was
possible
that
the
enemy
might
attempt
a
night
attack
we
were
on
the
alert
therefore
with
men
stationed
at
all
the
embrasures
but
nothing
unusual
occurred
the
batteries
fired
upon
us
at
stated
intervals
all
night
long
we
did
not
return
the
fire
having
no
ammunition
to
waste
on
the
morning
of
the
we
took
our
breakfast
or
rather
our
pork
and
water
at
the
usual
hour
and
marched
the
men
to
the
guns
when
the
meal
was
over
from
to
the
enemy
fire
was
very
spirited
from
to
a
came
on
and
there
was
a
lull
in
the
cannonading
about
the
officers
quarters
were
ignited
by
one
of
ripley
incendiary
shells
or
by
shot
heated
in
the
furnaces
at
fort
moultrie
the
fire
was
put
out
but
at
a
mortar
shell
passed
through
the
roof
and
lodged
in
the
flooring
of
the
second
story
where
it
burst
and
started
the
flames
afresh
this
too
was
extinguished
but
the
hot
shot
soon
followed
each
other
so
rapidly
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
contend
with
them
any
longer
it
became
evident
that
the
entire
block
being
built
with
wooden
partitions
floors
and
roofing
must
be
consumed
and
that
the
magazine
containing
three
hundred
barrels
of
powder
would
be
endangered
for
even
after
closing
the
metallic
door
sparks
might
penetrate
through
the
ventilator
the
floor
was
covered
with
loose
powder
where
a
detail
of
men
had
been
at
work
manufacturing
out
of
old
shirts
woolen
blankets
etc
while
the
officers
exerted
themselves
with
axes
to
tear
down
and
cut
away
all
the
in
the
vicinity
the
soldiers
were
rolling
barrels
of
powder
out
to
more
sheltered
spots
and
were
covering
them
with
wet
blankets
the
labor
was
accelerated
by
the
shells
which
were
bursting
around
us
for
ripley
had
redoubled
his
activity
at
the
first
signs
of
a
conflagration
we
only
succeeded
in
getting
out
some
barrels
of
powder
and
then
we
were
obliged
to
close
the
massive
copper
door
and
await
the
result
a
shot
soon
after
passed
through
the
intervening
shield
struck
the
door
and
bent
the
lock
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
not
be
opened
again
we
were
thus
cut
off
from
our
supply
of
ammunition
but
still
had
some
piled
up
in
the
vicinity
of
the
guns
anderson
officially
reported
only
four
barrels
and
three
cartridges
as
on
hand
when
we
left
by
the
conflagration
was
terrible
and
disastrous
of
the
fort
was
on
fire
and
the
wind
drove
the
smoke
in
dense
masses
into
the
angle
where
we
had
all
taken
refuge
it
seemed
impossible
to
escape
suffocation
some
lay
down
close
to
the
ground
with
handkerchiefs
over
their
mouths
and
others
posted
themselves
near
the
embrasures
where
the
smoke
was
somewhat
lessened
by
the
draught
of
air
every
one
suffered
severely
i
crawled
out
of
one
of
these
openings
and
sat
on
the
outer
edge
but
ripley
made
it
lively
for
me
there
with
his
which
spattered
all
around
had
not
a
slight
change
of
wind
taken
place
the
result
might
have
been
fatal
to
most
of
us
our
firing
having
ceased
and
the
enemy
being
very
jubilant
i
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
show
them
that
we
were
not
all
dead
yet
and
ordered
the
gunners
to
fire
a
few
rounds
more
i
heard
afterward
that
the
enemy
loudly
cheered
anderson
for
his
persistency
under
such
adverse
circumstances
the
scene
at
this
time
was
really
terrific
the
roaring
and
crackling
of
the
flames
the
dense
masses
of
whirling
smoke
the
bursting
of
the
enemy
shells
and
our
own
which
were
exploding
in
the
burning
rooms
the
crashing
of
the
shot
and
the
sound
of
masonry
falling
in
every
direction
made
the
fort
a
pandemonium
when
at
last
nothing
was
left
of
the
building
but
the
blackened
walls
and
smoldering
embers
it
became
painfully
evident
that
an
immense
amount
of
damage
had
been
done
there
was
a
tower
at
each
angle
of
the
fort
one
of
these
containing
great
quantities
of
shells
upon
which
we
had
relied
was
almost
completely
shattered
by
successive
explosions
the
massive
wooden
gates
studded
with
iron
nails
were
burned
and
the
wall
built
behind
them
was
now
a
mere
heap
of
débris
so
that
the
main
entrance
was
wide
open
for
an
assaulting
party
the
were
in
a
similar
condition
and
the
numerous
windows
on
the
gorge
side
which
had
been
planked
up
had
now
become
all
open
entrances
about
the
end
of
the
was
shot
down
and
the
flag
fell
it
had
been
previously
hanging
by
one
halliard
the
other
having
been
cut
by
a
piece
of
shell
the
exultation
of
the
enemy
however
was
peter
hart
found
a
spar
in
the
fort
which
answered
very
well
as
a
temporary
he
nailed
the
flag
to
this
and
raised
it
triumphantly
by
nailing
and
tying
the
pole
firmly
to
a
pile
of
on
the
parapet
this
was
gallantly
done
without
undue
haste
under
seymour
supervision
although
the
enemy
concentrated
all
their
fire
upon
the
spot
to
prevent
hart
from
carrying
out
his
intention
from
the
beginning
the
rebel
gunners
had
been
very
ambitious
to
shoot
the
flag
down
and
had
wasted
an
immense
number
of
shots
in
the
attempt
while
the
battle
was
going
on
a
correspondent
of
the
york
who
was
in
charleston
wrote
that
the
populace
were
calling
for
my
head
fortunately
i
was
not
there
to
gratify
them
my
relations
with
the
gentlemen
of
charleston
had
always
been
friendly
the
enmity
of
the
mob
was
simply
political
and
was
founded
on
the
belief
that
i
was
the
only
black
republican
as
they
termed
it
in
the
fort

xi

evacuation

the
question
of
casualties
on
the
other
salute
to
the
occupation
of
the
fort
by
southern
welcome
in
new
conclusion
there
was
a
large
wooden
hotel
near
the
shore
on
sullivan
island
called
the
moultrie
house
it
was
only
kept
open
during
the
summer
and
was
a
favorite
resort
for
planters
and
others
to
enjoy
the
fresh
and
the
beautiful
drive
up
the
beach
at
low
tide
since
the
rebel
occupation
of
fort
moultrie
this
hotel
had
been
used
as
a
dépôt
and
barracks
for
the
troops
in
the
vicinity
just
before
the
attack
was
made
upon
us
the
palmetto
flag
which
had
waved
over
the
building
was
taken
down
but
i
noticed
with
a
that
there
was
still
quite
a
number
of
people
apparently
troops
remaining
in
the
house
i
saw
no
reason
why
the
mere
lowering
of
the
flag
should
prevent
us
from
firing
at
them
i
therefore
aimed
two
pounder
balls
at
the
upper
story
the
crashing
of
the
shot
which
went
through
the
whole
length
of
the
building
among
the
clapboards
and
interior
partitions
must
have
been
something
fearful
to
those
who
were
within
they
came
rushing
out
in
furious
haste
and
tumbled
over
each
other
until
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
front
steps
in
one
writhing
tumultuous
mass
when
we
left
fort
sumter
a
south
carolina
officer
who
seemed
to
feel
aggrieved
in
relation
to
this
matter
asked
me
why
we
fired
at
that
building
not
caring
to
enter
into
a
discussion
at
that
time
i
evaded
it
by
telling
him
the
true
reason
was
that
the
landlord
had
given
me
a
wretched
room
there
one
night
and
this
being
the
only
opportunity
that
had
occurred
to
get
even
with
him
i
was
unable
to
resist
it
he
laughed
heartily
and
said
i
understand
it
all
now
you
were
perfectly
right
sir
and
i
justify
the
act
about
senator
wigfall
in
company
with
gourdin
young
of
charleston
unexpectedly
made
his
appearance
at
one
of
the
embrasures
having
crossed
over
from
morris
island
in
a
small
boat
rowed
by
negroes
he
had
seen
the
flag
come
down
and
supposed
that
we
had
surrendered
in
consequence
of
the
burning
of
the
quarters
this
visit
was
sanctioned
by
the
commander
of
morris
island
james
simons
an
serving
his
gun
was
very
much
astonished
to
see
a
man
face
at
the
entrance
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
there
wigfall
replied
that
he
wished
to
see
major
anderson
the
man
however
refused
to
allow
him
to
enter
until
he
had
surrendered
himself
as
a
prisoner
and
given
up
his
sword
this
done
another
was
sent
to
bring
an
officer
lieutenant
davis
came
almost
immediately
but
it
took
some
time
to
find
anderson
who
was
out
examining
the
condition
of
the
main
gates
i
was
not
present
during
this
scene
or
at
the
interview
that
ensued
as
i
was
engaged
in
trying
to
save
some
shells
in
the
upper
story
from
the
effects
of
the
fire
wigfall
in
beauregard
name
offered
anderson
his
own
terms
which
were
the
evacuation
of
the
fort
with
permission
to
salute
our
flag
and
to
march
out
with
the
honors
of
war
with
our
arms
and
private
baggage
leaving
all
other
war
material
behind
as
soon
as
this
matter
was
arranged
wigfall
returned
to
cummings
point
in
the
mean
time
beauregard
having
noticed
the
white
flag
sent
a
boat
containing
colonel
james
chestnut
and
captain
lee
colonel
roger
pryor
and
colonel
william
porcher
miles
to
ascertain
the
meaning
of
the
signal
a
second
boat
soon
followed
containing
major
jones
who
was
beauregard
manning
and
colonel
charles
alston
miles
and
pryor
were
exceedingly
astonished
when
they
heard
that
wigfall
had
been
carrying
on
negotiations
in
beauregard
name
and
stated
that
to
their
certain
knowledge
he
had
had
no
communication
with
beauregard
they
spoke
of
the
matter
with
great
delicacy
for
wigfall
was
a
parlous
man
and
quick
to
settle
disputed
points
with
the
pistol
anderson
replied
with
spirit
that
under
the
circumstances
he
would
run
up
his
flag
again
and
resume
the
firing
they
begged
him
however
not
to
take
action
until
they
had
had
an
opportunity
to
lay
the
whole
subject
before
general
beauregard
and
anderson
agreed
to
wait
a
reasonable
time
for
that
purpose
the
boat
then
returned
to
the
city
in
due
time
another
boat
arrived
containing
colonels
chestnut
and
chisholm
and
captain
stephen
lee
all
aids
of
beauregard
they
came
to
notify
major
anderson
that
the
latter
was
willing
to
treat
with
him
on
the
basis
proposed
colonel
charles
alston
soon
came
over
with
major
jones
who
was
to
beauregard
and
of
the
provisional
army
to
settle
the
details
of
the
evacuation
there
was
some
difficulty
about
permitting
us
to
salute
our
flag
but
that
too
was
finally
conceded
in
case
we
held
out
for
another
day
the
rebels
had
made
arrangements
to
storm
the
fort
that
night
during
all
these
operations
our
officers
and
men
behaved
with
great
gallantry
hall
snyder
and
meade
had
never
been
under
fire
before
but
they
proved
themselves
to
be
true
sons
of
their
alma
mater
at
west
point
the
first
contest
of
the
war
was
over
and
had
ended
as
a
substantial
victory
for
the
secessionists
they
had
commenced
the
campaign
naked
and
defenseless
but
the
general
government
had
allowed
them
time
to
levy
an
army
against
us
and
we
had
permitted
ourselves
to
be
surrounded
with
a
ring
of
fire
from
which
there
was
no
escape
nor
had
we
employed
to
the
fullest
extent
all
our
available
means
of
defense
no
attempt
had
ever
been
made
to
use
the
upper
tier
of
guns
which
contained
our
heaviest
metal
and
which
from
its
height
overlooked
the
enemy
works
and
was
therefore
the
most
efficient
part
of
our
armament
although
the
fire
of
our
columbiads
under
ordinary
circumstances
could
not
quite
reach
the
city
we
had
arranged
one
of
them
to
point
upward
at
the
maximum
angle
as
the
carriage
would
not
admit
of
this
the
gun
was
taken
off
and
made
to
rest
on
a
bed
of
masonry
seymour
and
myself
thought
by
loading
it
with
eccentric
shells
we
could
increase
the
range
of
the
guns
so
that
the
balls
would
reach
that
part
of
charleston
which
was
nearest
to
us
but
we
were
not
allowed
to
use
the
gun
at
all
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
a
manifest
desire
to
do
as
little
damage
as
possible
about
eighteen
hundred
shot
had
been
fired
into
fort
sumter
and
the
upper
story
was
pretty
well
knocked
to
pieces
to
walk
around
the
parapet
we
had
constantly
to
climb
over
heaps
of
débris
with
all
this
expenditure
of
ammunition
we
had
but
one
man
dangerously
wounded
this
was
john
schweirer
foreman
of
the
baltimore
he
was
struck
by
a
piece
of
shell
while
standing
near
the
open
so
long
as
our
men
fought
in
the
lower
casemates
which
were
the
vertical
fire
could
not
reach
them
and
by
drilling
them
to
step
one
side
of
the
embrasure
whenever
they
saw
the
flash
of
a
gun
opposite
they
escaped
the
danger
of
being
struck
by
any
ball
which
might
enter
the
opening
so
that
on
the
whole
they
ran
very
little
risk
had
they
used
the
guns
on
the
parapet
the
number
of
casualties
would
have
been
greatly
increased
but
our
missiles
would
have
been
much
more
effective
when
william
porcher
miles
was
about
to
enter
the
boat
to
return
to
charleston
he
told
our
commander
that
none
of
the
secession
soldiers
were
injured
by
our
fire
anderson
raised
his
hands
and
ejaculated
thank
god
for
that
as
the
object
of
our
fighting
was
to
do
as
much
damage
as
possible
i
could
see
no
propriety
in
thanking
heaven
for
the
small
amount
of
injury
we
had
inflicted
i
have
since
had
reason
to
suspect
from
several
circumstances
that
the
contest
was
not
as
bloodless
as
it
was
represented
to
be
at
the
time
the
coxswain
of
the
boat
that
brought
miles
over
heard
him
make
the
remark
that
no
one
was
hurt
on
the
rebel
side
the
man
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
in
undisguised
amazement
and
then
stepped
aside
behind
an
angle
of
the
work
where
he
could
indulge
in
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
his
whole
action
was
that
of
one
who
thought
his
chief
had
been
indulging
in
romance
of
course
miles
believed
the
assertion
or
he
would
not
have
made
it
the
fact
is
fort
moultrie
was
all
slivered
and
knocked
to
pieces
and
as
i
heard
so
much
in
reference
to
the
narrow
escapes
of
officers
and
soldiers
there
i
concluded
that
if
no
one
was
hurt
a
miracle
must
have
taken
place
the
rebel
who
carried
dispatches
between
fort
moultrie
and
mount
pleasant
in
a
small
boat
was
in
a
position
to
know
and
he
told
peter
hart
some
years
after
the
war
that
a
schooner
to
his
certain
knowledge
came
from
charleston
during
the
battle
and
took
off
a
number
of
killed
from
fort
moultrie
who
were
taken
to
potter
field
on
cooper
river
and
buried
there
on
saturday
at
i
had
previously
seen
the
same
story
published
as
coming
from
charleston
a
similar
statement
was
made
on
his
arrival
in
new
york
by
the
mate
of
the
schooner
and
it
purported
to
be
founded
on
his
own
observation
when
we
left
fort
sumter
for
new
york
a
man
of
my
company
named
fielding
was
seriously
injured
by
an
explosion
and
left
behind
in
the
hospital
at
charleston
he
was
frequently
visited
there
by
an
old
comrade
named
galloway
who
was
one
of
our
discharged
soldiers
galloway
laughed
at
the
idea
that
no
one
had
been
injured
and
told
fielding
that
he
himself
had
served
in
fort
moultrie
during
the
bombardment
and
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
a
number
of
killed
and
wounded
there
if
galloway
story
is
true
ripley
may
have
concealed
his
losses
as
he
did
not
wish
to
have
us
appear
more
successful
than
he
had
been
i
believe
there
were
a
great
many
irish
laborers
enlisted
in
fort
moultrie
and
their
loss
would
hardly
have
excited
a
remark
in
aristocratic
charleston
it
is
said
too
that
a
list
of
killed
and
wounded
was
posted
up
on
a
in
the
city
and
afterward
torn
down
for
fear
that
it
might
discourage
the
troops
on
the
other
hand
the
assertion
of
men
holding
high
official
position
on
the
other
side
that
no
one
was
killed
or
injured
would
seem
to
leave
little
room
for
doubt
when
beauregard
received
notice
that
anderson
was
willing
to
ratify
the
terms
agreed
upon
he
sent
over
another
boat
containing
colonel
miles
colonel
pryor
manning
major
jones
and
captain
hartstein
to
arrange
the
details
of
the
evacuation
almost
a
fatal
accident
occurred
to
roger
pryor
shortly
after
his
arrival
in
the
fort
he
was
sitting
in
the
hospital
at
a
table
with
a
black
bottle
and
a
tumbler
near
his
right
hand
the
place
was
quite
dark
having
been
built
up
all
around
with
boxes
of
sand
to
render
it
being
thirsty
and
not
noticing
what
he
did
he
mechanically
picked
up
the
bottle
poured
some
of
the
liquid
into
the
glass
and
drank
it
down
it
proved
to
be
iodide
of
potassium
which
is
quite
a
poisonous
compound
when
i
saw
him
he
was
very
pale
and
leaning
on
the
shoulder
of
crawford
who
was
taking
him
out
on
the
grass
to
apply
the
he
was
soon
out
of
danger
some
of
us
questioned
the
doctor
right
to
interpose
in
a
case
of
this
kind
it
was
argued
that
if
any
rebel
leader
chose
to
come
over
to
fort
sumter
and
poison
himself
the
medical
department
had
no
business
to
interfere
with
such
a
laudable
intention
the
doctor
however
claimed
with
some
show
of
reason
that
he
himself
was
held
responsible
to
the
united
states
for
the
medicine
in
the
hospital
and
therefore
he
could
not
permit
pryor
to
carry
any
of
it
away
all
of
the
preliminaries
having
been
duly
adjusted
it
was
decided
that
the
evacuation
should
take
place
the
next
morning
our
arrangements
were
few
and
simple
but
the
rebels
made
extensive
preparations
for
the
event
in
order
to
give
it
the
greatest
and
gain
from
it
as
much
prestige
as
possible
the
population
of
the
surrounding
country
poured
into
charleston
in
vast
multitudes
to
witness
the
humiliation
of
the
united
states
flag
we
slept
soundly
that
night
for
the
first
time
after
all
the
fatigue
and
excitement
of
the
two
preceding
days
the
next
morning
sunday
the
we
were
up
early
packing
our
baggage
in
readiness
to
go
on
board
the
transport
the
time
having
arrived
i
made
preparations
by
order
of
major
anderson
to
fire
a
national
salute
to
the
flag
it
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
attempt
as
sparks
of
fire
were
floating
around
everywhere
and
there
was
no
safe
place
to
deposit
the
ammunition
in
that
portion
of
the
line
commanded
by
lieutenant
hall
a
pile
of
cartridges
lay
under
the
muzzle
of
one
of
the
guns
some
fire
had
probably
lodged
inside
the
piece
which
the
sponging
did
not
extinguish
for
in
loading
it
it
went
off
prematurely
and
blew
off
the
right
arm
of
the
gunner
daniel
hough
who
was
an
excellent
soldier
his
death
was
almost
instantaneous
he
was
the
first
man
who
lost
his
life
on
our
side
in
the
war
for
the
union
the
damage
did
not
end
here
for
some
of
the
fire
from
the
muzzle
dropped
on
the
pile
of
cartridges
below
and
exploded
them
all
several
men
in
the
vicinity
were
blown
into
the
air
and
seriously
injured
their
names
were
george
fielding
john
irwin
george
pinchard
and
edwin
galway
and
i
think
james
hayes
the
being
very
badly
hurt
was
left
behind
to
be
cared
for
by
the
rebels
he
was
sent
over
to
charleston
where
he
was
well
treated
finally
cured
and
forwarded
to
us
without
being
exchanged
the
salute
being
over
the
confederate
troops
marched
in
to
occupy
the
fort
the
palmetto
guard
captain
cuthbert
company
detailed
by
colonel
de
saussure
and
captain
hollinquist
company
b
of
the
regulars
detailed
by
colonel
ripley
constituted
the
new
garrison
under
ripley
anderson
directed
me
to
form
the
men
on
the
assume
command
and
march
them
on
board
the
transport
i
told
him
i
should
prefer
to
leave
the
fort
with
the
flag
flying
and
the
drums
beating
yankee
doodle
and
he
authorized
me
to
do
so
as
soon
as
our
tattered
flag
came
down
and
the
silken
banner
made
by
the
ladies
of
charleston
was
run
up
tremendous
shouts
of
applause
were
heard
from
the
vast
multitude
of
spectators
and
all
the
vessels
and
steamers
with
one
accord
made
for
the
fort
corporal
bringhurst
came
running
to
tell
me
that
many
of
the
approaching
crowd
were
shouting
my
name
and
making
threatening
demonstrations
the
disorder
however
was
immediately
quelled
by
the
appearance
of
hartstein
an
of
our
navy
who
threw
out
sentinels
in
all
directions
and
prevented
the
mob
from
landing
the
bay
was
alive
with
floating
craft
of
every
description
filled
with
people
from
all
parts
of
the
south
in
their
holiday
attire
as
i
marched
out
at
the
head
of
our
little
band
of
regulars
it
must
have
presented
a
strange
contrast
to
the
numerous
forces
that
had
assailed
us
some
sixty
men
against
six
thousand
as
we
went
on
board
the
with
the
drums
beating
the
national
air
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
us
amidst
the
deepest
silence
it
was
an
hour
of
triumph
for
the
originators
of
secession
in
south
carolina
and
no
doubt
it
seemed
to
them
the
culmination
of
all
their
hopes
but
could
they
have
seen
into
the
future
with
the
eye
of
prophecy
their
joy
might
have
been
turned
into
mourning
who
among
them
could
have
conceived
that
the
charleston
they
deemed
so
invincible
which
they
boasted
would
never
be
polluted
by
the
footsteps
of
a
yankee
invader
until
every
son
of
the
soil
had
shed
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
in
her
defense
who
could
have
imagined
that
this
proud
metropolis
after
much
privation
and
from
fire
and
bombardment
would
finally
surrender
without
bloodshed
to
a
negro
regiment
under
a
massachusetts
flag
the
two
most
abhorred
elements
of
the
strife
to
the
proud
people
of
south
carolina
who
could
have
imagined
that
the
race
they
had
so
despised
was
destined
to
govern
them
in
the
future
in
the
dense
ignorance
which
the
south
itself
had
created
by
prohibiting
the
education
of
the
blacks
my
story
is
nearly
done
we
soon
reached
the
and
were
received
with
great
sympathy
and
feeling
by
the
army
and
navy
officers
present
among
the
latter
was
captain
fox
who
afterward
became
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
after
we
had
left
the
harbor
bishop
lynch
of
charleston
threw
the
catholic
influence
in
favor
of
the
secessionists
by
celebrating
the
southern
victory
by
a
grand
we
arrived
in
new
york
on
the
and
were
received
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
all
the
passing
steamers
saluted
us
with
their
and
bells
and
cheer
after
cheer
went
up
from
the
and
vessels
in
the
harbor
we
did
not
attempt
to
land
but
came
to
anchor
in
the
stream
between
governor
island
and
the
battery
several
distinguished
citizens
at
once
came
on
board
and
major
anderson
was
immediately
carried
off
to
dine
with
lloyd
aspinwall
as
somebody
had
to
remain
with
the
troops
and
attend
to
their
wants
i
accompanied
them
to
fort
hamilton
where
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
comfortable
quarters
nearly
all
of
the
officers
obtained
a
furlough
immediately
but
i
remained
in
command
of
the
fort
during
the
temporary
absence
of
major
anderson
who
was
soon
after
permanently
detached
from
us
our
captivity
had
deeply
touched

amounted

ovation

the
and

a
hearty
welcome

a
long
time
the

ridden

shoulders

torn

pieces

beecher
came
down
to
the
fort
to
meet
us
and
made
a
ringing
speech
full
of
fire
and
patriotism
it
seemed
as
if
every
one
of
note
called
to
express
his
devotion
to
the
cause
of
the
union
and
his
sympathy
with
us

hamlin
father
named
four
of
his
sons
europe
asia
africa
and
america
the
fact
that
one
of
them
was
called
africa
gave
rise
to
the
statement
that
he
was
an
african
he
afterward
returned
gave
bail
and
appeared
before
the
court
because
he
was
aware
that
a
rule
existed
that
parties
who
had
given
evidence
before
a
congressional
committee
in
reference
to
any
defalcation
could
not
be
tried
for
having
taken
part
in
it
it
is
true
there
is
a
law
authorizing
the
distribution
of
united
states
arms
to
the
states
but
there
were
no
surplus
muskets
on
hand
and
even
if
there
had
been
it
was
a
very
injudicious
time
to
distribute
them
among
the
insurgent
states
a
little
delay
would
have
been
both
patriotic
and
judicious
my
brother
and
myself
each
owned
copies
of
the
same
dictionary
instead
of
using
a
word
in
my
correspondence
i
simply
referred
to
its
place
in
the
book
by
giving
the
number
of
the
page
number
of
the
column
and
number
of
the
word
from
the
top
of
the
page
he
left
the
united
states
service
soon
after
the
attack
on
fort
sumter
and
joined
the
confederates
he
did
so
reluctantly
for
he
had
gained
great
renown
in
our
army
for
his
gallantry
in
mexico
and
he
knew
he
would
soon
have
been
promoted
to
the
position

of

ordnance
department

he
remained

my

applied
for

in

but
was
told
she
must
first
obtain
the
sanction
of
rhett
the
editor
of

she
was
afterward
informed
by
the
keeper
that
as
the
house
depended
on
the
patronage
of
the
southern
people
for
support
she
the

having

on

of

among

children
was
a
little
waif
called
dick
kowley
afterward
known
as
sumter
dick
he
had
been
abandoned
by
his
mother
and
thus
thrown
out
on
the
world
for
a
time
he
was
sent
after
his
arrival
in
new
york
to
the
house
of
stewart
who
was
a
family
connection
of
mine
after
supper
he
reminded
the
ladies
that
he
had
not
heard
tattoo
yet
and
wished
to
know
at
what
hour
they
beat
the
reveille
he
evidently
thought
every
family
kept
a
drummer
and
fifer
on
hand
to
sound
the
calls
he
was
very
unhappy
until
he
had
procured
a
small
stick
and
a
miniature
flag
every
morning
at
sunrise
he
hoisted
the
flag
and
carefully
lowered
it
and
put
it
away
at
sunset
he
is
now
a
at
marion
ohio
and
recently
gained
a
prize
for
his
excellent
workmanship
it
is
due
to
the
major
to
state
that
in
a
speech
made
before
the
board
of
brokers
in
new
york
on
the
of
may
he
asserted
that
if
the
question
lay
between
the
preservation
of
the
union
or
the
preservation
of
slavery
slavery
must
be
sacrificed
about
this
time
my
wife
who
was
in
washington
was
very
much
surprised
at
receiving
a
call
from
the
president
he
came
quietly
to
request
her
to
show
him
my
letters
from
fort
sumter
so
that
he
might
form
a
better
opinion
as
to
the
condition
of
affairs
there
more
particularly
in
regard
to
our
resources
i
have
since
learned
that
the
shell
from
fort
johnson
was
not
a
hostile
shot
but
was
simply
intended
as
a
signal
for
the
firing
to
commence
in
this
he
was
an
exception
to
most
negroes
those
i
have
seen
in
the
colored
regiments
in

have
shown
themselves
to
be
among
the
best
and
most
reliable
men
