the
perfect
tribute
on
the
morning
of
november
a
special
train
drew
out
from
washington
carrying
a
distinguished
company
the
presence
with
them
of
the
marine
band
from
the
navy
yard
spoke
a
public
occasion
to
come
and
among
the
travellers
there
were
those
who
might
be
gathered
only
for
an
occasion
of
importance
there
were
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
there
were
heads
of
departments
the
of
the
army
and
his
staff
members
of
the
cabinet
in
their
midst
as
they
stood
about
the
car
before
settling
for
the
journey
towered
a
man
sad
preoccupied
unassuming
a
man
awkward
and
a
man
as
he
leaned
slouchingly
against
the
wall
of
no
grace
of
look
or
manner
in
whose
haggard
face
seemed
to
be
the
suffering
of
the
sins
of
the
world
abraham
lincoln
president
of
the
united
states
journeyed
with
his
party
to
assist
at
the
consecration
the
next
day
of
the
national
cemetery
at
gettysburg
the
quiet
november
landscape
slipped
past
the
rattling
train
and
the
president
eyes
stared
out
at
it
gravely
a
bit
listlessly
from
time
to
time
he
talked
with
those
who
were
about
him
from
time
to
time
there
were
flashes
of
that
quaint
wit
which
is
linked
as
his
greatness
with
his
name
but
his
mind
was
dispirited
unhopeful
the
weight
on
his
shoulders
seemed
pressing
more
heavily
than
he
had
courage
to
press
back
against
it
the
responsibility
of
one
almost
a
dictator
in
a
wide
country
came
near
to
crushing
at
times
the
mere
human
soul
and
body
there
was
moreover
a
speech
to
be
made
to
thousands
who
would
expect
their
president
to
say
something
to
them
worth
the
listening
of
a
people
who
were
making
history
something
brilliant
eloquent
strong
the
melancholy
gaze
glittered
with
a
grim
smile
he
abraham
lincoln
the
lad
bred
in
a
cabin
tutored
in
rough
schools
here
and
there
fighting
for
snatching
at
crumbs
of
learning
that
fell
from
rich
tables
struggling
to
a
hard
knowledge
which
well
knew
its
own
limitations
it
was
he
of
whom
this
was
expected
he
glanced
across
the
car
edward
everett
sat
there
the
orator
of
the
following
day
the
finished
gentleman
the
careful
student
the
heir
of
traditions
of
learning
and
breeding
of
scholarly
instincts
and
resources
the
president
gazed
at
him
wistfully
from
him
the
people
might
expect
and
would
get
a
balanced
and
polished
oration
for
that
end
he
had
been
born
and
inheritance
and
opportunity
and
inclination
had
worked
together
for
that
end
perfection
while
lincoln
had
wrested
from
a
scanty
schooling
a
command
of
english
clear
and
forcible
always
but
he
feared
lacking
he
feared
in
finish
and
in
breadth
of
what
use
was
it
for
such
a
one
to
try
to
fashion
a
speech
fit
to
take
a
place
by
the
side
of
everett
silver
sentences
he
sighed
yet
the
people
had
a
right
to
the
best
he
could
give
and
he
would
give
them
his
best
at
least
he
could
see
to
it
that
the
words
were
real
and
were
short
at
least
he
would
not
so
exhaust
their
patience
and
the
work
might
as
well
be
done
now
in
the
leisure
of
the
journey
he
put
a
hand
big
powerful
into
first
one
sagging
pocket
and
then
another
in
search
of
a
pencil
and
drew
out
one
broken
across
the
end
he
glanced
about
inquiringly
there
was
nothing
to
write
upon
across
the
car
the
secretary
of
state
had
just
opened
a
package
of
books
and
their
wrapping
of
brown
paper
lay
on
the
floor
torn
carelessly
in
a
zigzag
the
president
stretched
a
long
arm
seward
may
i
have
this
to
do
a
little
writing
he
asked
and
the
secretary
protested
insisting
on
finding
better
material
but
lincoln
with
few
words
had
his
way
and
soon
the
untidy
stump
of
a
pencil
was
at
work
and
the
great
head
the
face
bent
over
seward
bit
of
brown
paper
the
whole
man
absorbed
in
his
task
earnestly
with
that
capacity
for
taking
infinite
pains
which
has
been
defined
as
genius
he
labored
as
the
hours
flew
building
together
word
on
word
sentence
on
sentence
as
the
sculptor
must
dream
the
statue
prisoned
in
the
marble
as
the
artist
must
dream
the
picture
to
come
from
the
brilliant
unmeaning
of
his
palette
as
the
musician
dreams
a
song
so
he
who
writes
must
have
a
vision
of
his
finished
work
before
he
touches
to
begin
it
a
medium
more
elastic
more
vivid
more
powerful
than
any
other
words
prismatic
bits
of
humanity
old
as
the
pharaohs
new
as
the
arabs
of
the
street
broken
sparkling
alive
from
the
life
of
the
race
abraham
lincoln
with
the
clear
thought
in
his
mind
of
what
he
would
say
found
the
sentences
that
came
to
him
colorless
wooden
a
wonder
flashed
over
him
once
or
twice
of
everett
skill
with
these
symbols
which
it
seemed
to
him
were
to
the
bostonian
a
facile
to
make
music
to
lincoln
tools
to
do
his
labor
he
put
the
idea
aside
for
it
hindered
him
as
he
found
the
sword
fitted
to
his
hand
he
must
fight
with
it
it
might
be
that
he
as
well
as
everett
could
say
that
which
should
go
straight
from
him
to
his
people
to
the
nation
who
struggled
at
his
back
towards
a
goal
at
least
each
syllable
he
said
should
be
chiselled
from
the
rock
of
his
sincerity
so
he
cut
here
and
there
an
adjective
here
and
there
a
phrase
baring
the
heart
of
his
thought
leaving
no
ribbon
or
flower
of
rhetoric
to
flutter
in
the
eyes
of
those
with
whom
he
would
be
utterly
honest
and
when
he
had
done
he
read
the
speech
and
dropped
it
from
his
hand
to
the
floor
and
stared
again
from
the
window
it
was
the
best
he
could
do
and
it
was
a
failure
so
with
the
pang
of
the
workman
who
believes
his
work
done
wrong
he
lifted
and
folded
the
torn
bit
of
paper
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
put
aside
the
thought
of
it
as
of
a
bad
thing
which
he
might
not
better
and
turned
and
talked
cheerfully
with
his
friends
at
eleven
on
the
morning
of
the
day
following
on
november
a
vast
silent
multitude
billowed
like
waves
of
the
sea
over
what
had
been
not
long
before
the
of
gettysburg
there
were
wounded
soldiers
there
who
had
beaten
their
way
four
months
before
through
a
singing
fire
across
these
quiet
fields
who
had
seen
the
men
die
who
were
buried
here
there
were
troops
grave
and
responsible
who
must
soon
go
again
into
battle
there
were
the
rank
and
file
of
an
everyday
american
gathering
in
surging
thousands
and
above
them
all
on
the
platform
there
were
the
leaders
of
the
land
the
pilots
who
lifted
a
hand
from
the
wheel
of
the
ship
of
state
to
salute
the
memory
of
those
gone
down
in
the
storm
most
of
the
men
in
that
group
of
honor
are
now
passed
over
to
the
majority
but
their
names
are
not
dead
in
american
history
great
ghosts
who
walk
still
in
the
annals
of
their
country
their
faces
were
turned
attentively
that
bright
still
november
afternoon
towards
the
orator
of
the
day
whose
voice
held
the
audience
for
two
hours
everett
spoke
and
the
throng
listened
untired
fascinated
by
the
dignity
of
his
look
and
manner
almost
as
much
perhaps
as
by
the
speech
which
has
taken
a
place
in
literature
as
he
had
been
expected
to
speak
he
spoke
of
the
great
battle
of
the
causes
of
the
war
of
the
results
to
come
after
it
was
an
oration
which
missed
no
shade
of
expression
no
reach
of
grasp
yet
there
were
those
in
the
multitude
sympathetic
to
a
unit
as
it
was
with
the
northern
cause
who
grew
restless
when
this
man
who
had
been
crowned
with
so
thick
a
laurel
wreath
by
americans
spoke
of
americans
as
rebels
of
a
cause
for
which
honest
americans
were
giving
their
lives
as
a
crime
the
days
were
war
days
and
men
passions
were
inflamed
yet
there
were
men
who
listened
to
edward
everett
who
believed
that
his
great
speech
would
have
been
greater
unenforced
with
bitterness
as
the
clear
cultivated
voice
fell
into
silence
the
mass
of
people
burst
into
a
long
storm
of
applause
for
they
knew
that
they
had
heard
an
oration
which
was
an
event
they
clapped
and
cheered
him
again
and
again
and
again
as
good
citizens
acclaim
a
man
worthy
of
honor
whom
they
have
delighted
to
honor
at
last
as
the
of
massachusetts
the
to
england
the
of
state
the
of
the
united
states
handsome
distinguished
graceful
sure
of
voice
and
of
movement
took
his
seat
a
tall
gaunt
figure
detached
itself
from
the
group
on
the
platform
and
slouched
slowly
across
the
open
space
and
stood
facing
the
audience
a
stir
and
a
whisper
brushed
over
the
field
of
humanity
as
if
a
breeze
had
rippled
a
monstrous
bed
of
poppies
this
was
the
president
a
quivering
silence
settled
down
and
every
eye
was
wide
to
watch
this
strange
disappointing
appearance
every
ear
alert
to
catch
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
suddenly
the
voice
came
in
a
queer
squeaking
falsetto
the
effect
on
the
audience
was
irrepressible
ghastly
after
everett
deep
tones
after
the
strain
of
expectancy
this
extraordinary
gaunt
apparition
this
high
thin
sound
from
the
huge
body
were
too
much
for
the
american
crowd
sense
of
humor
always
stronger
than
its
sense
of
reverence
a
suppressed
yet
unmistakable
titter
caught
the
throng
ran
through
it
and
was
gone
yet
no
one
who
knew
the
president
face
could
doubt
that
he
had
heard
it
and
had
understood
calmly
enough
after
a
pause
almost
too
slight
to
be
recognized
he
went
on
and
in
a
dozen
words
his
tones
had
gathered
volume
he
had
come
to
his
power
and
dignity
there
was
no
smile
now
on
any
face
of
those
who
listened
people
stopped
breathing
rather
as
if
they
feared
to
miss
an
inflection
a
figure
six
feet
four
inches
high
he
towered
above
them
conscious
of
and
quietly
ignoring
the
bad
first
impression
unconscious
of
a
charm
of
personality
which
reversed
that
impression
within
a
sentence
that
these
were
his
people
was
his
only
thought
he
had
something
to
say
to
them
what
did
it
matter
about
him
or
his
voice
fourscore
and
seven
years
ago
spoke
the
president
our
fathers
brought
forth
on
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
testing
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
it
as
a
final
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
that
nation
might
live
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
we
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hallow
this
ground
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
to
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
but
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
for
us
the
living
rather
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
so
nobly
advanced
it
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us
that
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
here
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
there
was
no
sound
from
the
silent
vast
assembly
the
large
figure
stood
before
them
at
first
inspired
glorified
with
the
thrill
and
swing
of
his
words
lapsing
slowly
in
the
stillness
into
lax
ungraceful
lines
he
stared
at
them
a
moment
with
sad
eyes
full
of
gentleness
of
resignation
and
in
the
deep
quiet
they
stared
at
him
not
a
hand
was
lifted
in
applause
slowly
the
big
awkward
man
slouched
back
across
the
platform
and
sank
into
his
seat
and
yet
there
was
no
sound
of
approval
of
recognition
from
the
audience
only
a
long
sigh
ran
like
a
ripple
on
an
ocean
through
rank
after
rank
in
lincoln
heart
a
throb
of
pain
answered
it
his
speech
had
been
as
he
feared
it
would
be
a
failure
as
he
gazed
steadily
at
these
his
countrymen
who
would
not
give
him
even
a
little
perfunctory
applause
for
his
best
effort
he
knew
that
the
disappointment
of
it
cut
into
his
soul
and
then
he
was
aware
that
there
was
music
the
choir
was
singing
a
dirge
his
part
was
done
and
his
part
had
failed
when
the
ceremonies
were
over
everett
at
once
found
the
president
president
he
began
your
speech
but
lincoln
had
interrupted
flashing
a
kindly
smile
down
at
him
laying
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
we
manage
not
to
talk
about
my
speech
everett
he
said
this
is
the
first
time
i
felt
that
my
dignity
ought
not
to
permit
me
to
be
a
public
speaker
he
went
on
in
a
few
cordial
sentences
to
pay
tribute
to
the
orator
of
the
occasion
everett
listened
thoughtfully
and
when
the
chief
had
done
president
he
said
simply
i
should
be
glad
if
i
could
flatter
myself
that
i
came
as
near
the
central
idea
of
the
occasion
in
two
hours
as
you
did
in
two
minutes
but
lincoln
shook
his
head
and
laughed
and
turned
to
speak
to
a
newcomer
with
no
change
of
opinion
he
was
apt
to
trust
his
own
judgments
the
special
train
which
left
gettysburg
immediately
after
the
solemnities
on
the
cemetery
brought
the
president
party
into
washington
during
the
night
there
was
no
rest
for
the
man
at
the
wheel
of
the
nation
next
day
but
rather
added
work
until
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
he
felt
sorely
the
need
of
air
and
went
out
from
the
white
house
alone
for
a
walk
his
mind
still
ran
on
the
events
of
the
day
before
the
impressive
quiet
multitude
the
serene
sky
of
november
arched
in
the
hushed
interregnum
of
the
year
between
the
joy
of
summer
and
the
war
of
winter
over
those
who
had
gone
from
earthly
war
to
heavenly
joy
the
picture
was
deeply
engraved
in
his
memory
it
haunted
him
and
with
it
came
a
soreness
a
discomfort
of
mind
which
had
haunted
him
as
well
in
the
hours
between
the
chagrin
of
the
failure
of
his
speech
during
the
day
he
had
gently
but
decisively
put
aside
all
reference
to
it
from
those
about
him
he
had
glanced
at
the
in
the
newspapers
with
a
sarcastic
smile
the
chief
executive
must
he
flattered
of
course
newspaper
notices
meant
nothing
he
knew
well
that
he
had
made
many
successful
speeches
no
man
of
his
shrewdness
could
be
ignorant
that
again
and
again
he
had
carried
an
audience
by
storm
yet
he
had
no
high
idea
of
his
own
and
yesterday
affair
had
shaken
his
confidence
more
he
remembered
sadly
that
even
for
the
president
no
hand
no
voice
had
been
lifted
in
applause
it
must
have
been
pretty
poor
stuff
he
said
half
aloud
yet
i
thought
it
was
a
fair
little
composition
i
meant
to
do
well
by
them
his
long
strides
had
carried
him
into
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
suddenly
at
a
corner
from
behind
a
hedge
a
young
boy
of
fifteen
years
or
so
came
rushing
toward
him
and
tripped
and
stumbled
against
him
and
lincoln
kept
him
from
falling
with
a
quick
vigorous
arm
the
lad
righted
himself
and
tossed
back
his
thick
light
hair
and
stared
haughtily
and
the
president
regarding
him
saw
that
his
blue
eyes
were
blind
with
tears
do
you
want
all
of
the
public
highway
ca
a
gentleman
from
the
south
even
walk
in
the
streets
without
without
and
the
broken
sentence
ended
in
a
sob
the
anger
and
the
insolence
of
the
lad
were
nothing
to
the
man
who
towered
above
him
to
that
broad
mind
this
was
but
a
child
in
trouble
my
boy
the
fellow
that
interfering
with
your
walking
is
down
inside
of
you
he
said
gently
and
with
that
the
astonished
youngster
opened
his
wet
eyes
wide
and
laughed
a
choking
childish
laugh
that
pulled
at
the
older
man
that
better
sonny
he
said
and
patted
the
slim
shoulder
now
tell
me
what
wrong
with
the
world
maybe
i
might
help
straighten
it
wrong
wrong
the
child
raved
everything
wrong
and
launched
into
a
mad
tirade
against
the
government
from
the
president
down
lincoln
listened
patiently
and
when
the
lad
paused
for
breath
go
ahead
he
said
every
little
helps
with
that
the
youngster
was
silent
and
drew
himself
up
with
stiff
dignity
offended
yet
fascinated
unable
to
tear
himself
away
from
this
strange
giant
who
was
so
insultingly
kind
under
his
abuse
who
yet
inspired
him
with
such
a
sense
of
trust
and
of
hope
i
want
a
lawyer
he
said
impulsively
looking
up
anxiously
into
the
face
inches
above
him
i
do
know
where
to
find
a
lawyer
in
this
horrible
city
and
i
must
have
one
i
ca
wait
it
may
be
too
late
i
want
a
lawyer
and
once
more
he
was
in
a
fever
of
excitement
what
do
you
want
with
a
lawyer
again
the
calm
friendly
tone
quieted
him
i
want
him
to
draw
a
will
my
brother
is
he
caught
his
breath
with
a
gasp
in
a
desperate
effort
for
they
say
he
dying
he
finished
the
sentence
with
a
quiver
in
his
voice
and
the
brave
front
and
the
trembling
childish
tone
went
to
the
man
heart
i
do
believe
it
he
ca
be
dying
the
boy
talked
on
gathering
courage
but
anyway
he
wants
to
make
a
will
and
and
i
reckon
it
may
be
that
he
he
must
i
see
the
other
answered
gravely
and
the
young
torn
soul
felt
an
unreasoning
confidence
that
he
had
found
a
friend
where
is
your
brother
he
in
the
prison
hospital
there
in
that
big
building
he
pointed
down
the
street
he
captain
in
our
army
in
the
confederate
army
he
was
wounded
at
gettysburg
oh
the
eyes
gazed
down
at
the
fresh
face
its
muscles
straining
under
grief
and
responsibility
with
the
gentlest
most
fatherly
pity
i
think
i
can
manage
your
job
my
boy
he
said
i
used
to
practise
law
in
a
small
way
myself
and
i
be
glad
to
draw
the
will
for
you
the
young
fellow
had
whirled
him
around
before
he
had
finished
the
sentence
come
he
said
do
waste
time
talking
why
you
tell
me
before
and
then
he
glanced
up
he
saw
the
clothes
the
head
the
awkward
carriage
of
the
man
he
was
too
young
to
know
that
what
he
felt
beyond
these
was
greatness
there
was
a
tone
of
patronage
in
his
voice
and
in
the
cock
of
his
aristocratic
young
head
as
he
spoke
we
can
pay
you
you
know
we
not
paupers
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
lincoln
face
to
watch
the
impression
as
he
added
my
brother
is
carter
hampton
blair
of
georgia
i
warrington
blair
the
hampton
court
blairs
you
know
oh
said
the
president
the
lad
went
on
it
would
have
been
all
right
if
nellie
had
left
washington
my
sister
miss
eleanor
hampton
blair
carter
was
better
this
morning
and
so
she
went
with
the
senator
she
secretary
to
senator
warrington
you
know
he
on
the
yankee
side
the
tone
was
full
of
contempt
but
yet
he
our
cousin
and
when
he
offered
nellie
the
position
she
would
take
it
in
spite
of
carter
and
me
we
were
so
poor
the
lad
pride
was
off
its
guard
for
the
moment
melted
in
the
soothing
trust
with
which
this
stranger
thrilled
his
soul
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
talk
and
the
large
hand
which
rested
on
his
shoulder
as
they
walked
seemed
an
assurance
that
his
words
were
accorded
respect
and
understanding
of
course
if
nellie
had
been
here
she
would
have
known
how
to
get
a
lawyer
but
carter
had
a
bad
turn
half
an
hour
ago
and
the
doctor
said
he
might
get
better
or
he
might
die
any
minute
and
carter
remembered
about
the
money
and
got
so
excited
that
they
said
it
was
hurting
him
so
i
said
i
get
a
lawyer
and
i
rushed
out
and
the
first
thing
i
ran
against
you
i
afraid
i
very
polite
the
smile
on
the
gaunt
face
above
him
was
all
the
answer
he
needed
i
sorry
i
apologize
it
certainly
was
good
of
you
to
come
right
back
with
me
the
child
manner
was
full
of
the
assured
graciousness
of
a
gentleman
there
was
a
lovable
quality
in
his
very
patronage
and
the
suffering
and
the
sweetness
and
the
pride
combined
held
lincoln
by
his
sense
of
humor
as
well
as
by
his
soft
heart
you
lose
anything
by
it
the
youngster
went
on
we
may
be
poor
but
we
have
more
than
plenty
to
pay
you
i
sure
nellie
has
some
jewels
you
see
oh
i
think
several
things
yet
is
it
very
expensive
to
draw
a
will
he
asked
wistfully
no
sonny
it
one
of
the
cheapest
things
a
man
can
do
was
the
hurried
answer
and
the
child
tone
showed
a
lighter
heart
i
glad
of
that
for
of
course
carter
wants
to
leave
to
leave
as
much
as
he
can
you
see
that
what
the
will
is
about
carter
is
engaged
to
marry
miss
sally
maxfield
and
they
would
have
been
married
now
if
he
had
been
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
so
of
course
like
any
gentleman
that
engaged
he
wants
to
give
her
everything
that
he
has
hampton
court
has
to
come
to
me
after
carter
but
there
some
money
quite
a
lot
only
we
ca
get
it
now
and
that
ought
to
go
to
carter
wife
which
is
what
she
is
just
about
and
if
he
make
a
will
it
wo
it
will
come
to
nellie
and
me
if
if
anything
should
happen
to
carter
so
you
worrying
for
fear
you
inherit
some
money
lincoln
asked
meditatively
of
course
the
boy
threw
back
impatiently
of
course
it
would
be
a
shame
if
it
came
to
nellie
and
me
for
we
could
ever
make
her
take
it
we
do
need
it
i
can
look
after
nellie
and
myself
he
said
proudly
with
a
quick
tossing
motion
of
his
fair
head
that
was
like
the
motion
of
a
spirited
thoroughbred
horse
they
had
arrived
at
the
prison
i
can
get
you
through
all
right
they
all
know
me
here
he
spoke
over
his
shoulder
reassuringly
to
the
president
with
a
friendly
glance
dashing
down
the
corridors
in
front
he
did
not
see
the
guards
salute
the
tall
figure
which
followed
him
too
preoccupied
to
wonder
at
the
ease
of
their
entrance
he
flew
along
through
the
big
building
and
behind
him
in
large
strides
came
his
friend
a
young
man
almost
a
boy
too
of
or
his
handsome
face
a
white
shadow
lay
propped
against
the
pillows
watching
the
door
eagerly
as
they
entered
good
boy
warry
he
greeted
the
little
fellow
you
got
me
a
lawyer
and
the
pale
features
lighted
with
a
smile
of
such
radiance
as
seemed
incongruous
in
this
gruesome
place
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
man
who
swung
toward
him
looming
mountainous
behind
his
slight
figure
thank
you
for
coming
he
said
cordially
and
in
his
tone
was
the
same
air
of
a
as
in
the
lad
suddenly
a
spasm
of
pain
caught
him
his
head
fell
into
the
pillows
his
muscles
twisted
his
arm
about
the
neck
of
the
kneeling
boy
tightened
convulsively
yet
while
the
agony
still
held
him
he
was
smiling
again
with
gay
courage
it
nearly
blew
me
away
he
whispered
his
voice
shaking
but
his
eyes
bright
with
amusement
we
better
get
to
work
before
one
of
those
little
breezes
carries
me
too
far
there
pen
and
ink
on
the
table
my
brother
did
not
tell
me
your
name
your
brother
and
i
met
informally
the
other
answered
setting
the
materials
in
order
for
writing
he
charged
into
me
like
a
young
steer
and
the
boy
out
of
his
deep
trouble
laughed
delightedly
my
name
is
lincoln
the
young
officer
regarded
him
that
a
good
name
from
your
standpoint
you
are
i
take
it
a
northerner
the
deep
eyes
smiled
whimsically
i
on
that
side
of
the
fence
you
may
call
me
a
yankee
if
you
like
there
something
about
you
lincoln
the
young
georgian
answered
gravely
with
a
kindly
and
unconscious
condescension
which
makes
me
wish
to
call
you
if
i
may
a
friend
he
had
that
happy
instinct
which
shapes
a
sentence
to
fall
on
its
smoothest
surface
and
the
president
in
whom
the
same
instinct
was
strong
felt
a
quick
comradeship
with
this
enemy
who
about
to
die
saluted
him
he
put
out
his
great
fist
swiftly
shake
hands
he
said
friends
it
is
death
us
do
part
said
the
officer
slowly
and
smiled
and
then
threw
back
his
head
with
a
gesture
like
the
boy
we
must
do
the
will
he
said
peremptorily
yes
now
we
fix
this
will
business
captain
blair
the
big
man
answered
cheerfully
when
your
mind
relieved
about
your
plunder
you
can
rest
easier
and
get
well
faster
the
sweet
brilliant
smile
of
the
southerner
shone
out
his
arm
drew
the
boy
shoulder
closer
and
the
president
with
a
pang
knew
that
his
friend
knew
that
he
must
die
with
direct
condensed
question
and
clear
answer
the
simple
will
was
shortly
drawn
and
the
impromptu
lawyer
rose
to
take
his
leave
but
the
wounded
man
put
out
his
hand
do
go
yet
he
pleaded
with
the
imperious
winning
accent
which
was
characteristic
of
both
brothers
the
sudden
radiant
smile
broke
again
over
the
face
young
drawn
with
suffering
prophetic
of
close
death
i
like
you
he
brought
out
frankly
i
never
liked
a
stranger
as
much
in
such
short
order
before
his
head
fair
as
the
boy
lay
back
on
the
pillows
locks
of
hair
damp
against
the
whiteness
the
blue
eyes
shone
like
jewels
from
the
colorless
face
a
weak
arm
stretched
protectingly
about
the
young
brother
who
pressed
against
him
there
was
so
much
courage
so
much
helplessness
so
much
pathos
in
the
picture
that
the
president
great
heart
throbbed
with
a
desire
to
comfort
them
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
that
man
lincoln
your
namesake
the
prisoner
deep
uncertain
voice
went
on
trying
pathetically
to
make
conversation
which
might
interest
might
hold
his
guest
the
man
who
stood
hesitating
controlled
a
startled
movement
i
southern
to
the
core
of
me
and
i
believe
with
my
soul
in
the
cause
i
fought
for
the
cause
i
he
stopped
and
his
hand
caressed
the
boy
shoulder
but
that
president
of
yours
is
a
remarkable
man
he
regarded
as
a
red
devil
by
most
of
us
down
home
you
know
and
he
laughed
but
i
admired
him
all
along
he
inspired
by
principle
not
by
animosity
in
this
fight
he
real
and
he
powerful
and
he
lifted
his
head
impetuously
and
his
eyes
flashed
and
by
jove
have
you
read
his
speech
of
yesterday
in
the
papers
lincoln
gave
him
an
odd
look
no
he
said
i
have
sit
down
blair
commanded
do
grudge
a
few
minutes
to
a
man
in
hard
luck
i
want
to
tell
you
about
that
speech
you
not
so
busy
but
that
you
ought
to
know
well
yes
said
lincoln
perhaps
i
ought
he
took
out
his
watch
and
made
a
quick
mental
calculation
it
only
a
question
of
going
without
my
dinner
and
the
boy
is
dying
he
thought
if
i
can
give
him
a
little
pleasure
the
dinner
is
a
small
matter
he
spoke
again
it
the
soldiers
who
are
the
busy
men
not
the
lawyers
nowadays
he
said
i
be
delighted
to
spend
a
half
hour
with
you
captain
blair
if
i
wo
tire
you
that
good
of
you
the
young
officer
said
and
a
king
on
his
throne
could
not
have
been
gracious
in
a
more
lordly
yet
unconscious
way
by
the
way
this
great
man
is
any
relation
of
yours
is
he
mr
lincoln
he
a
kind
of
connection
through
my
grandfather
lincoln
acknowledged
but
i
know
just
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
you
can
say
what
you
want
what
i
want
to
say
first
is
this
that
he
yesterday
made
one
of
the
great
speeches
of
history
what
demanded
lincoln
staring
i
know
what
i
talking
about
the
young
fellow
brought
his
thin
fist
down
on
the
bedclothes
my
father
was
a
speaker
all
my
uncles
and
my
grandfather
were
speakers
i
been
brought
up
on
oratory
i
studied
and
read
the
best
models
since
i
was
a
lad
in
and
i
know
a
great
speech
when
i
see
it
and
when
nellie
my
sister
brought
in
the
paper
this
morning
and
read
that
to
me
i
told
her
at
once
that
not
six
times
since
history
began
has
a
speech
been
made
which
was
its
equal
that
was
before
she
told
me
what
the
senator
said
what
did
the
senator
say
asked
the
quiet
man
who
listened
it
was
senator
warrington
to
whom
my
sister
is
is
acting
as
secretary
the
explanation
was
distasteful
but
he
went
on
carried
past
the
jog
by
the
interest
of
his
story
he
was
at
gettysburg
yesterday
with
the
president
party
he
told
my
sister
that
the
speech
so
went
home
to
the
hearts
of
all
those
thousands
of
people
that
when
it
was
ended
it
was
as
if
the
whole
audience
held
its
breath
there
was
not
a
hand
lifted
to
applaud
one
might
as
well
applaud
the
lord
prayer
it
would
have
been
sacrilege
and
they
all
felt
it
down
to
the
lowest
there
was
a
long
minute
of
reverent
silence
no
sound
from
all
that
great
throng
it
seems
to
me
an
enemy
that
it
was
the
most
perfect
tribute
that
has
ever
been
paid
by
any
people
to
any
orator
the
boy
lifting
his
hand
from
his
brother
shoulder
to
mark
the
effect
of
his
brother
words
saw
with
surprise
that
in
the
strange
lawyer
eyes
were
tears
but
the
wounded
man
did
not
notice
it
will
live
that
speech
fifty
years
from
now
american
schoolboys
will
be
learning
it
as
part
of
their
education
it
is
not
merely
my
opinion
he
went
on
warrington
says
the
whole
country
is
ringing
with
it
and
you
have
read
it
and
your
name
lincoln
warry
boy
where
the
paper
nellie
left
i
read
the
speech
to
lincoln
myself
the
boy
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
across
the
room
and
had
lifted
a
folded
newspaper
from
the
table
let
me
read
it
carter
it
might
tire
you
the
giant
figure
which
had
crouched
elbows
on
knees
in
the
shadows
by
the
narrow
hospital
cot
heaved
itself
slowly
upward
till
it
loomed
at
its
full
height
in
air
lincoln
turned
his
face
toward
the
boy
standing
under
the
flickering
and
reading
with
soft
sliding
inflections
the
words
which
had
for
hours
been
gall
and
wormwood
to
his
memory
and
as
the
sentences
slipped
from
the
mouth
behold
a
miracle
happened
for
the
man
who
had
written
them
knew
that
they
were
great
he
knew
then
as
many
a
lesser
one
has
known
that
out
of
a
little
had
come
great
joy
that
he
had
wrested
with
gentleness
a
blessing
from
his
enemy
and
seven
years
ago
the
fresh
voice
began
and
the
face
of
the
dying
man
stood
out
white
in
the
white
pillows
sharp
with
eagerness
and
the
face
of
the
president
shone
as
he
listened
as
if
to
new
words
the
field
of
yesterday
the
speech
the
deep
silence
which
followed
it
all
were
illuminated
as
his
mind
went
back
with
new
meaning
with
the
realization
that
the
stillness
had
meant
not
indifference
but
perhaps
as
this
generous
enemy
had
said
the
most
perfect
tribute
ever
paid
by
any
people
to
any
orator
there
came
to
him
a
rush
of
glad
strength
to
bear
the
burdens
of
the
nation
the
boy
tones
ended
clearly
deliberately
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
there
was
deep
stillness
in
the
hospital
ward
as
there
had
been
stillness
on
the
field
of
gettysburg
the
soldier
voice
broke
it
it
a
wonderful
speech
he
said
there
nothing
finer
other
men
have
spoken
stirring
words
for
the
north
and
for
the
south
but
never
before
i
think
with
the
love
of
both
breathing
through
them
it
is
only
the
greatest
who
can
be
a
partisan
without
bitterness
and
only
such
may
call
himself
not
northern
or
southern
but
american
to
feel
that
your
enemy
can
fight
you
to
death
without
malice
with
charity
it
lifts
country
it
lifts
humanity
to
something
worth
dying
for
they
are
beautiful
broad
words
and
the
sting
of
war
would
be
drawn
if
the
soul
of
lincoln
could
be
breathed
into
the
armies
do
you
agree
with
me
he
demanded
abruptly
and
lincoln
answered
slowly
from
a
happy
heart
i
believe
it
is
a
good
speech
he
said
the
impetuous
southerner
went
on
of
course
it
all
wrong
from
my
point
of
view
and
the
gentleness
of
his
look
made
the
words
charming
the
thought
which
underlies
it
is
warped
inverted
as
i
look
at
it
yet
that
does
alter
my
admiration
of
the
man
and
of
his
words
i
like
to
put
my
hand
in
his
before
i
die
he
said
and
the
sudden
brilliant
sweet
smile
lit
the
transparency
of
his
face
like
a
lamp
and
i
like
to
tell
him
that
i
know
that
what
we
all
fighting
for
the
best
of
us
is
the
right
of
our
country
as
it
is
given
us
to
see
it
he
was
laboring
a
bit
with
the
words
now
as
if
he
were
tired
but
he
hushed
the
boy
imperiously
when
a
man
gets
so
close
to
death
door
that
he
feels
the
wind
through
it
from
a
larger
atmosphere
then
the
small
things
are
blown
away
the
bitterness
of
the
fight
has
faded
for
me
i
only
feel
the
love
of
country
the
satisfaction
of
giving
my
life
for
it
the
speech
that
speech
has
made
it
look
higher
and
simpler
your
side
as
well
as
ours
i
would
like
to
put
my
hand
in
abraham
lincoln
the
clear
deep
voice
with
its
hesitations
its
catch
of
weakness
stopped
short
convulsively
the
hand
shot
out
and
caught
at
the
great
fingers
that
hung
near
him
pulling
the
president
with
the
strength
of
agony
to
his
knees
by
the
cot
the
prisoner
was
writhing
in
an
attack
of
mortal
pain
while
he
held
unknowing
that
he
held
it
the
hand
of
his
new
friend
in
a
torturing
grip
the
door
of
death
had
opened
wide
and
a
stormy
wind
was
carrying
the
bright
conquered
spirit
into
that
larger
atmosphere
of
which
he
had
spoken
suddenly
the
struggle
ceased
the
unconscious
head
rested
in
the
boy
arms
and
the
hand
of
the
southern
soldier
lay
quiet
where
he
had
wished
to
place
it
in
the
hand
of
abraham
lincoln
