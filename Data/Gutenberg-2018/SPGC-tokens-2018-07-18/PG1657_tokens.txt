crito
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
the
crito
seems
intended
to
exhibit
the
character
of
socrates
in
one
light
only
not
as
the
philosopher
fulfilling
a
divine
mission
and
trusting
in
the
will
of
heaven
but
simply
as
the
good
citizen
who
having
been
unjustly
condemned
is
willing
to
give
up
his
life
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
state
the
days
of
socrates
are
drawing
to
a
close
the
fatal
ship
has
been
seen
off
sunium
as
he
is
informed
by
his
aged
friend
and
contemporary
crito
who
visits
him
before
the
dawn
has
broken
he
himself
has
been
warned
in
a
dream
that
on
the
third
day
he
must
depart
time
is
precious
and
crito
has
come
early
in
order
to
gain
his
consent
to
a
plan
of
escape
this
can
be
easily
accomplished
by
his
friends
who
will
incur
no
danger
in
making
the
attempt
to
save
him
but
will
be
disgraced
for
ever
if
they
allow
him
to
perish
he
should
think
of
his
duty
to
his
children
and
not
play
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
money
is
already
provided
by
crito
as
well
as
by
simmias
and
others
and
he
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
friends
in
thessaly
and
other
places
socrates
is
afraid
that
crito
is
but
pressing
upon
him
the
opinions
of
the
many
whereas
all
his
life
long
he
has
followed
the
dictates
of
reason
only
and
the
opinion
of
the
one
wise
or
skilled
man
there
was
a
time
when
crito
himself
had
allowed
the
propriety
of
this
and
although
some
one
will
say
many
can
kill
us
that
makes
no
difference
but
a
good
life
in
other
words
a
just
and
honourable
life
is
alone
to
be
valued
all
considerations
of
loss
of
reputation
or
injury
to
his
children
should
be
dismissed
the
only
question
is
whether
he
would
be
right
in
attempting
to
escape
crito
who
is
a
disinterested
person
not
having
the
fear
of
death
before
his
eyes
shall
answer
this
for
him
before
he
was
condemned
they
had
often
held
discussions
in
which
they
agreed
that
no
man
should
either
do
evil
or
return
evil
for
evil
or
betray
the
right
are
these
principles
to
be
altered
because
the
circumstances
of
socrates
are
altered
crito
admits
that
they
remain
the
same
then
is
his
escape
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
them
to
this
crito
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
reply
socrates
proceeds
suppose
the
laws
of
athens
to
come
and
remonstrate
with
him
they
will
ask
does
he
seek
to
overturn
them
and
if
he
replies
have
injured
him
will
not
the
laws
answer
but
was
that
the
agreement
has
he
any
objection
to
make
to
them
which
would
justify
him
in
overturning
them
was
he
not
brought
into
the
world
and
educated
by
their
help
and
are
they
not
his
parents
he
might
have
left
athens
and
gone
where
he
pleased
but
he
has
lived
there
for
seventy
years
more
constantly
than
any
other
citizen
thus
he
has
clearly
shown
that
he
acknowledged
the
agreement
which
he
can
not
now
break
without
dishonour
to
himself
and
danger
to
his
friends
even
in
the
course
of
the
trial
he
might
have
proposed
exile
as
the
penalty
but
then
he
declared
that
he
preferred
death
to
exile
and
whither
will
he
direct
his
footsteps
in
any
state
the
laws
will
consider
him
as
an
enemy
possibly
in
a
land
of
misrule
like
thessaly
he
may
be
welcomed
at
first
and
the
unseemly
narrative
of
his
escape
will
be
regarded
by
the
inhabitants
as
an
amusing
tale
but
if
he
offends
them
he
will
have
to
learn
another
sort
of
lesson
will
he
continue
to
give
lectures
in
virtue
that
would
hardly
be
decent
and
how
will
his
children
be
the
gainers
if
he
takes
them
into
thessaly
and
deprives
them
of
athenian
citizenship
or
if
he
leaves
them
behind
does
he
expect
that
they
will
be
better
taken
care
of
by
his
friends
because
he
is
in
thessaly
will
not
true
friends
care
for
them
equally
whether
he
is
alive
or
dead
finally
they
exhort
him
to
think
of
justice
first
and
of
life
and
children
afterwards
he
may
now
depart
in
peace
and
innocence
a
sufferer
and
not
a
doer
of
evil
but
if
he
breaks
agreements
and
returns
evil
for
evil
they
will
be
angry
with
him
while
he
lives
and
their
brethren
the
laws
of
the
world
below
will
receive
him
as
an
enemy
such
is
the
mystic
voice
which
is
always
murmuring
in
his
ears
that
socrates
was
not
a
good
citizen
was
a
charge
made
against
him
during
his
lifetime
which
has
been
often
repeated
in
later
ages
the
crimes
of
alcibiades
critias
and
charmides
who
had
been
his
pupils
were
still
recent
in
the
memory
of
the
now
restored
democracy
the
fact
that
he
had
been
neutral
in
the
of
athens
was
not
likely
to
conciliate
popular
plato
writing
probably
in
the
next
generation
undertakes
the
defence
of
his
friend
and
master
in
this
particular
not
to
the
athenians
of
his
day
but
to
posterity
and
the
world
at
large
whether
such
an
incident
ever
really
occurred
as
the
visit
of
crito
and
the
proposal
of
escape
is
uncertain
plato
could
easily
have
invented
far
more
than
that
phaedr
and
in
the
selection
of
crito
the
aged
friend
as
the
fittest
person
to
make
the
proposal
to
socrates
we
seem
to
recognize
the
hand
of
the
artist
whether
any
one
who
has
been
subjected
by
the
laws
of
his
country
to
an
unjust
judgment
is
right
in
attempting
to
escape
is
a
thesis
about
which
casuists
might
disagree
shelley
prose
works
is
of
opinion
that
socrates
well
to
die
but
not
for
the
reasons
which
plato
has
put
into
his
mouth
and
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
arguing
that
socrates
should
have
lived
and
preferred
to
a
glorious
death
the
good
which
he
might
still
be
able
to
perform
rhetorician
would
have
had
much
to
say
upon
that
point
it
may
be
observed
however
that
plato
never
intended
to
answer
the
question
of
casuistry
but
only
to
exhibit
the
ideal
of
patient
virtue
which
refuses
to
do
the
least
evil
in
order
to
avoid
the
greatest
and
to
show
his
master
maintaining
in
death
the
opinions
which
he
had
professed
in
his
life
not
world
but
the
wise
man
is
still
the
paradox
of
socrates
in
his
last
hours
he
must
be
guided
by
reason
although
her
conclusions
may
be
fatal
to
him
the
remarkable
sentiment
that
the
wicked
can
do
neither
good
nor
evil
is
true
if
taken
in
the
sense
which
he
means
of
moral
evil
in
his
own
words
can
not
make
a
man
wise
or
foolish
this
little
dialogue
is
a
perfect
piece
of
dialectic
in
which
granting
the
principle
there
is
no
escaping
from
the
conclusion
it
is
anticipated
at
the
beginning
by
the
dream
of
socrates
and
the
parody
of
homer
the
personification
of
the
laws
and
of
their
brethren
the
laws
in
the
world
below
is
one
of
the
noblest
and
boldest
figures
of
speech
which
occur
in
plato
crito
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
persons
of
the
dialogue
socrates
crito
scene
the
prison
of
socrates
socrates
why
have
you
come
at
this
hour
crito
it
must
be
quite
early
crito
yes
certainly
socrates
what
is
the
exact
time
crito
the
dawn
is
breaking
socrates
i
wonder
that
the
keeper
of
the
prison
would
let
you
in
crito
he
knows
me
because
i
often
come
socrates
moreover
i
have
done
him
a
kindness
socrates
and
are
you
only
just
arrived
crito
no
i
came
some
time
ago
socrates
then
why
did
you
sit
and
say
nothing
instead
of
at
once
awakening
me
crito
i
should
not
have
liked
myself
socrates
to
be
in
such
great
trouble
and
unrest
as
you
are
indeed
i
should
not
i
have
been
watching
with
amazement
your
peaceful
slumbers
and
for
that
reason
i
did
not
awake
you
because
i
wished
to
minimize
the
pain
i
have
always
thought
you
to
be
of
a
happy
disposition
but
never
did
i
see
anything
like
the
easy
tranquil
manner
in
which
you
bear
this
calamity
socrates
why
crito
when
a
man
has
reached
my
age
he
ought
not
to
be
repining
at
the
approach
of
death
crito
and
yet
other
old
men
find
themselves
in
similar
misfortunes
and
age
does
not
prevent
them
from
repining
socrates
that
is
true
but
you
have
not
told
me
why
you
come
at
this
early
hour
crito
i
come
to
bring
you
a
message
which
is
sad
and
painful
not
as
i
believe
to
yourself
but
to
all
of
us
who
are
your
friends
and
saddest
of
all
to
me
socrates
what
has
the
ship
come
from
delos
on
the
arrival
of
which
i
am
to
die
crito
no
the
ship
has
not
actually
arrived
but
she
will
probably
be
here
as
persons
who
have
come
from
sunium
tell
me
that
they
have
left
her
there
and
therefore
socrates
will
be
the
last
day
of
your
life
socrates
very
well
crito
if
such
is
the
will
of
god
i
am
willing
but
my
belief
is
that
there
will
be
a
delay
of
a
day
crito
why
do
you
think
so
socrates
i
will
tell
you
i
am
to
die
on
the
day
after
the
arrival
of
the
ship
crito
yes
that
is
what
the
authorities
say
socrates
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
ship
will
be
here
until
this
i
infer
from
a
vision
which
i
had
last
night
or
rather
only
just
now
when
you
fortunately
allowed
me
to
sleep
crito
and
what
was
the
nature
of
the
vision
socrates
there
appeared
to
me
the
likeness
of
a
woman
fair
and
comely
clothed
in
bright
raiment
who
called
to
me
and
said
o
socrates
third
day
hence
to
fertile
phthia
shalt
thou
go
homer
il
crito
what
a
singular
dream
socrates
socrates
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
meaning
crito
i
think
crito
yes
the
meaning
is
only
too
clear
but
oh
my
beloved
socrates
let
me
entreat
you
once
more
to
take
my
advice
and
escape
for
if
you
die
i
shall
not
only
lose
a
friend
who
can
never
be
replaced
but
there
is
another
evil
people
who
do
not
know
you
and
me
will
believe
that
i
might
have
saved
you
if
i
had
been
willing
to
give
money
but
that
i
did
not
care
now
can
there
be
a
worse
disgrace
than
this
that
i
should
be
thought
to
value
money
more
than
the
life
of
a
friend
for
the
many
will
not
be
persuaded
that
i
wanted
you
to
escape
and
that
you
refused
socrates
but
why
my
dear
crito
should
we
care
about
the
opinion
of
the
many
good
men
and
they
are
the
only
persons
who
are
worth
considering
will
think
of
these
things
truly
as
they
occurred
crito
but
you
see
socrates
that
the
opinion
of
the
many
must
be
regarded
for
what
is
now
happening
shows
that
they
can
do
the
greatest
evil
to
any
one
who
has
lost
their
good
opinion
socrates
i
only
wish
it
were
so
crito
and
that
the
many
could
do
the
greatest
evil
for
then
they
would
also
be
able
to
do
the
greatest
good
and
what
a
fine
thing
this
would
be
but
in
reality
they
can
do
neither
for
they
can
not
make
a
man
either
wise
or
foolish
and
whatever
they
do
is
the
result
of
chance
crito
well
i
will
not
dispute
with
you
but
please
to
tell
me
socrates
whether
you
are
not
acting
out
of
regard
to
me
and
your
other
friends
are
you
not
afraid
that
if
you
escape
from
prison
we
may
get
into
trouble
with
the
informers
for
having
stolen
you
away
and
lose
either
the
whole
or
a
great
part
of
our
property
or
that
even
a
worse
evil
may
happen
to
us
now
if
you
fear
on
our
account
be
at
ease
for
in
order
to
save
you
we
ought
surely
to
run
this
or
even
a
greater
risk
be
persuaded
then
and
do
as
i
say
socrates
yes
crito
that
is
one
fear
which
you
mention
but
by
no
means
the
only
one
crito
fear
not
there
are
persons
who
are
willing
to
get
you
out
of
prison
at
no
great
cost
and
as
for
the
informers
they
are
far
from
being
exorbitant
in
their
demands
a
little
money
will
satisfy
them
my
means
which
are
certainly
ample
are
at
your
service
and
if
you
have
a
scruple
about
spending
all
mine
here
are
strangers
who
will
give
you
the
use
of
theirs
and
one
of
them
simmias
the
theban
has
brought
a
large
sum
of
money
for
this
very
purpose
and
cebes
and
many
others
are
prepared
to
spend
their
money
in
helping
you
to
escape
i
say
therefore
do
not
hesitate
on
our
account
and
do
not
say
as
you
did
in
the
court
compare
apol
that
you
will
have
a
difficulty
in
knowing
what
to
do
with
yourself
anywhere
else
for
men
will
love
you
in
other
places
to
which
you
may
go
and
not
in
athens
only
there
are
friends
of
mine
in
thessaly
if
you
like
to
go
to
them
who
will
value
and
protect
you
and
no
thessalian
will
give
you
any
trouble
nor
can
i
think
that
you
are
at
all
justified
socrates
in
betraying
your
own
life
when
you
might
be
saved
in
acting
thus
you
are
playing
into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
who
are
hurrying
on
your
destruction
and
further
i
should
say
that
you
are
deserting
your
own
children
for
you
might
bring
them
up
and
educate
them
instead
of
which
you
go
away
and
leave
them
and
they
will
have
to
take
their
chance
and
if
they
do
not
meet
with
the
usual
fate
of
orphans
there
will
be
small
thanks
to
you
no
man
should
bring
children
into
the
world
who
is
unwilling
to
persevere
to
the
end
in
their
nurture
and
education
but
you
appear
to
be
choosing
the
easier
part
not
the
better
and
manlier
which
would
have
been
more
becoming
in
one
who
professes
to
care
for
virtue
in
all
his
actions
like
yourself
and
indeed
i
am
ashamed
not
only
of
you
but
of
us
who
are
your
friends
when
i
reflect
that
the
whole
business
will
be
attributed
entirely
to
our
want
of
courage
the
trial
need
never
have
come
on
or
might
have
been
managed
differently
and
this
last
act
or
crowning
folly
will
seem
to
have
occurred
through
our
negligence
and
cowardice
who
might
have
saved
you
if
we
had
been
good
for
anything
and
you
might
have
saved
yourself
for
there
was
no
difficulty
at
all
see
now
socrates
how
sad
and
discreditable
are
the
consequences
both
to
us
and
you
make
up
your
mind
then
or
rather
have
your
mind
already
made
up
for
the
time
of
deliberation
is
over
and
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
which
must
be
done
this
very
night
and
if
we
delay
at
all
will
be
no
longer
practicable
or
possible
i
beseech
you
therefore
socrates
be
persuaded
by
me
and
do
as
i
say
socrates
dear
crito
your
zeal
is
invaluable
if
a
right
one
but
if
wrong
the
greater
the
zeal
the
greater
the
danger
and
therefore
we
ought
to
consider
whether
i
shall
or
shall
not
do
as
you
say
for
i
am
and
always
have
been
one
of
those
natures
who
must
be
guided
by
reason
whatever
the
reason
may
be
which
upon
reflection
appears
to
me
to
be
the
best
and
now
that
this
chance
has
befallen
me
i
can
not
repudiate
my
own
words
the
principles
which
i
have
hitherto
honoured
and
revered
i
still
honour
and
unless
we
can
at
once
find
other
and
better
principles
i
am
certain
not
to
agree
with
you
no
not
even
if
the
power
of
the
multitude
could
inflict
many
more
imprisonments
confiscations
deaths
frightening
us
like
children
with
hobgoblin
terrors
compare
what
will
be
the
fairest
way
of
considering
the
question
shall
i
return
to
your
old
argument
about
the
opinions
of
men
we
were
saying
that
some
of
them
are
to
be
regarded
and
others
not
now
were
we
right
in
maintaining
this
before
i
was
condemned
and
has
the
argument
which
was
once
good
now
proved
to
be
talk
for
the
sake
of
talking
mere
childish
nonsense
that
is
what
i
want
to
consider
with
your
help
crito
whether
under
my
present
circumstances
the
argument
appears
to
be
in
any
way
different
or
not
and
is
to
be
allowed
by
me
or
disallowed
that
argument
which
as
i
believe
is
maintained
by
many
persons
of
authority
was
to
the
effect
as
i
was
saying
that
the
opinions
of
some
men
are
to
be
regarded
and
of
other
men
not
to
be
regarded
now
you
crito
are
not
going
to
die
at
least
there
is
no
human
probability
of
this
and
therefore
you
are
disinterested
and
not
liable
to
be
deceived
by
the
circumstances
in
which
you
are
placed
tell
me
then
whether
i
am
right
in
saying
that
some
opinions
and
the
opinions
of
some
men
only
are
to
be
valued
and
that
other
opinions
and
the
opinions
of
other
men
are
not
to
be
valued
i
ask
you
whether
i
was
right
in
maintaining
this
crito
certainly
socrates
the
good
are
to
be
regarded
and
not
the
bad
crito
yes
socrates
and
the
opinions
of
the
wise
are
good
and
the
opinions
of
the
unwise
are
evil
crito
certainly
socrates
and
what
was
said
about
another
matter
is
the
pupil
who
devotes
himself
to
the
practice
of
gymnastics
supposed
to
attend
to
the
praise
and
blame
and
opinion
of
every
man
or
of
one
man
only
his
physician
or
trainer
whoever
he
may
be
crito
of
one
man
only
socrates
and
he
ought
to
fear
the
censure
and
welcome
the
praise
of
that
one
only
and
not
of
the
many
crito
clearly
so
socrates
and
he
ought
to
act
and
train
and
eat
and
drink
in
the
way
which
seems
good
to
his
single
master
who
has
understanding
rather
than
according
to
the
opinion
of
all
other
men
put
together
crito
true
socrates
and
if
he
disobeys
and
disregards
the
opinion
and
approval
of
the
one
and
regards
the
opinion
of
the
many
who
have
no
understanding
will
he
not
suffer
evil
crito
certainly
he
will
socrates
and
what
will
the
evil
be
whither
tending
and
what
affecting
in
the
disobedient
person
crito
clearly
affecting
the
body
that
is
what
is
destroyed
by
the
evil
socrates
very
good
and
is
not
this
true
crito
of
other
things
which
we
need
not
separately
enumerate
in
questions
of
just
and
unjust
fair
and
foul
good
and
evil
which
are
the
subjects
of
our
present
consultation
ought
we
to
follow
the
opinion
of
the
many
and
to
fear
them
or
the
opinion
of
the
one
man
who
has
understanding
ought
we
not
to
fear
and
reverence
him
more
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
and
if
we
desert
him
shall
we
not
destroy
and
injure
that
principle
in
us
which
may
be
assumed
to
be
improved
by
justice
and
deteriorated
by
injustice
there
is
such
a
principle
crito
certainly
there
is
socrates
socrates
take
a
parallel
instance
if
acting
under
the
advice
of
those
who
have
no
understanding
we
destroy
that
which
is
improved
by
health
and
is
deteriorated
by
disease
would
life
be
worth
having
and
that
which
has
been
destroyed
is
the
body
crito
yes
socrates
could
we
live
having
an
evil
and
corrupted
body
crito
certainly
not
socrates
and
will
life
be
worth
having
if
that
higher
part
of
man
be
destroyed
which
is
improved
by
justice
and
depraved
by
injustice
do
we
suppose
that
principle
whatever
it
may
be
in
man
which
has
to
do
with
justice
and
injustice
to
be
inferior
to
the
body
crito
certainly
not
socrates
more
honourable
than
the
body
crito
far
more
socrates
then
my
friend
we
must
not
regard
what
the
many
say
of
us
but
what
he
the
one
man
who
has
understanding
of
just
and
unjust
will
say
and
what
the
truth
will
say
and
therefore
you
begin
in
error
when
you
advise
that
we
should
regard
the
opinion
of
the
many
about
just
and
unjust
good
and
evil
honorable
and
some
one
will
say
the
many
can
kill
us
crito
yes
socrates
that
will
clearly
be
the
answer
socrates
and
it
is
true
but
still
i
find
with
surprise
that
the
old
argument
is
unshaken
as
ever
and
i
should
like
to
know
whether
i
may
say
the
same
of
another
proposition
that
not
life
but
a
good
life
is
to
be
chiefly
valued
crito
yes
that
also
remains
unshaken
socrates
and
a
good
life
is
equivalent
to
a
just
and
honorable
one
that
holds
also
crito
yes
it
does
socrates
from
these
premisses
i
proceed
to
argue
the
question
whether
i
ought
or
ought
not
to
try
and
escape
without
the
consent
of
the
athenians
and
if
i
am
clearly
right
in
escaping
then
i
will
make
the
attempt
but
if
not
i
will
abstain
the
other
considerations
which
you
mention
of
money
and
loss
of
character
and
the
duty
of
educating
one
children
are
i
fear
only
the
doctrines
of
the
multitude
who
would
be
as
ready
to
restore
people
to
life
if
they
were
able
as
they
are
to
put
them
to
death
and
with
as
little
reason
but
now
since
the
argument
has
thus
far
prevailed
the
only
question
which
remains
to
be
considered
is
whether
we
shall
do
rightly
either
in
escaping
or
in
suffering
others
to
aid
in
our
escape
and
paying
them
in
money
and
thanks
or
whether
in
reality
we
shall
not
do
rightly
and
if
the
latter
then
death
or
any
other
calamity
which
may
ensue
on
my
remaining
here
must
not
be
allowed
to
enter
into
the
calculation
crito
i
think
that
you
are
right
socrates
how
then
shall
we
proceed
socrates
let
us
consider
the
matter
together
and
do
you
either
refute
me
if
you
can
and
i
will
be
convinced
or
else
cease
my
dear
friend
from
repeating
to
me
that
i
ought
to
escape
against
the
wishes
of
the
athenians
for
i
highly
value
your
attempts
to
persuade
me
to
do
so
but
i
may
not
be
persuaded
against
my
own
better
judgment
and
now
please
to
consider
my
first
position
and
try
how
you
can
best
answer
me
crito
i
will
socrates
are
we
to
say
that
we
are
never
intentionally
to
do
wrong
or
that
in
one
way
we
ought
and
in
another
way
we
ought
not
to
do
wrong
or
is
doing
wrong
always
evil
and
dishonorable
as
i
was
just
now
saying
and
as
has
been
already
acknowledged
by
us
are
all
our
former
admissions
which
were
made
within
a
few
days
to
be
thrown
away
and
have
we
at
our
age
been
earnestly
discoursing
with
one
another
all
our
life
long
only
to
discover
that
we
are
no
better
than
children
or
in
spite
of
the
opinion
of
the
many
and
in
spite
of
consequences
whether
better
or
worse
shall
we
insist
on
the
truth
of
what
was
then
said
that
injustice
is
always
an
evil
and
dishonour
to
him
who
acts
unjustly
shall
we
say
so
or
not
crito
yes
socrates
then
we
must
do
no
wrong
crito
certainly
not
socrates
nor
when
injured
injure
in
return
as
the
many
imagine
for
we
must
injure
no
one
at
all
compare
crito
clearly
not
socrates
again
crito
may
we
do
evil
crito
surely
not
socrates
socrates
and
what
of
doing
evil
in
return
for
evil
which
is
the
morality
of
the
many
is
that
just
or
not
crito
not
just
socrates
for
doing
evil
to
another
is
the
same
as
injuring
him
crito
very
true
socrates
then
we
ought
not
to
retaliate
or
render
evil
for
evil
to
any
one
whatever
evil
we
may
have
suffered
from
him
but
i
would
have
you
consider
crito
whether
you
really
mean
what
you
are
saying
for
this
opinion
has
never
been
held
and
never
will
be
held
by
any
considerable
number
of
persons
and
those
who
are
agreed
and
those
who
are
not
agreed
upon
this
point
have
no
common
ground
and
can
only
despise
one
another
when
they
see
how
widely
they
differ
tell
me
then
whether
you
agree
with
and
assent
to
my
first
principle
that
neither
injury
nor
retaliation
nor
warding
off
evil
by
evil
is
ever
right
and
shall
that
be
the
premiss
of
our
argument
or
do
you
decline
and
dissent
from
this
for
so
i
have
ever
thought
and
continue
to
think
but
if
you
are
of
another
opinion
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
say
if
however
you
remain
of
the
same
mind
as
formerly
i
will
proceed
to
the
next
step
crito
you
may
proceed
for
i
have
not
changed
my
mind
socrates
then
i
will
go
on
to
the
next
point
which
may
be
put
in
the
form
of
a
question
ought
a
man
to
do
what
he
admits
to
be
right
or
ought
he
to
betray
the
right
crito
he
ought
to
do
what
he
thinks
right
socrates
but
if
this
is
true
what
is
the
application
in
leaving
the
prison
against
the
will
of
the
athenians
do
i
wrong
any
or
rather
do
i
not
wrong
those
whom
i
ought
least
to
wrong
do
i
not
desert
the
principles
which
were
acknowledged
by
us
to
be
just
what
do
you
say
crito
i
can
not
tell
socrates
for
i
do
not
know
socrates
then
consider
the
matter
in
this
way
imagine
that
i
am
about
to
play
truant
you
may
call
the
proceeding
by
any
name
which
you
like
and
the
laws
and
the
government
come
and
interrogate
me
us
socrates
they
say
are
you
about
are
you
not
going
by
an
act
of
yours
to
overturn
us
the
laws
and
the
whole
state
as
far
as
in
you
lies
do
you
imagine
that
a
state
can
subsist
and
not
be
overthrown
in
which
the
decisions
of
law
have
no
power
but
are
set
aside
and
trampled
upon
by
individuals
what
will
be
our
answer
crito
to
these
and
the
like
words
any
one
and
especially
a
rhetorician
will
have
a
good
deal
to
say
on
behalf
of
the
law
which
requires
a
sentence
to
be
carried
out
he
will
argue
that
this
law
should
not
be
set
aside
and
shall
we
reply
but
the
state
has
injured
us
and
given
an
unjust
sentence
suppose
i
say
that
crito
very
good
socrates
socrates
was
that
our
agreement
with
you
the
law
would
answer
were
you
to
abide
by
the
sentence
of
the
state
and
if
i
were
to
express
my
astonishment
at
their
words
the
law
would
probably
add
socrates
instead
of
opening
your
eyes
you
are
in
the
habit
of
asking
and
answering
questions
tell
us
what
complaint
have
you
to
make
against
us
which
justifies
you
in
attempting
to
destroy
us
and
the
state
in
the
first
place
did
we
not
bring
you
into
existence
your
father
married
your
mother
by
our
aid
and
begat
you
say
whether
you
have
any
objection
to
urge
against
those
of
us
who
regulate
marriage
none
i
should
reply
against
those
of
us
who
after
birth
regulate
the
nurture
and
education
of
children
in
which
you
also
were
trained
were
not
the
laws
which
have
the
charge
of
education
right
in
commanding
your
father
to
train
you
in
music
and
gymnastic
right
i
should
reply
then
since
you
were
brought
into
the
world
and
nurtured
and
educated
by
us
can
you
deny
in
the
first
place
that
you
are
our
child
and
slave
as
your
fathers
were
before
you
and
if
this
is
true
you
are
not
on
equal
terms
with
us
nor
can
you
think
that
you
have
a
right
to
do
to
us
what
we
are
doing
to
you
would
you
have
any
right
to
strike
or
revile
or
do
any
other
evil
to
your
father
or
your
master
if
you
had
one
because
you
have
been
struck
or
reviled
by
him
or
received
some
other
evil
at
his
hands
you
would
not
say
this
and
because
we
think
right
to
destroy
you
do
you
think
that
you
have
any
right
to
destroy
us
in
return
and
your
country
as
far
as
in
you
lies
will
you
o
professor
of
true
virtue
pretend
that
you
are
justified
in
this
has
a
philosopher
like
you
failed
to
discover
that
our
country
is
more
to
be
valued
and
higher
and
holier
far
than
mother
or
father
or
any
ancestor
and
more
to
be
regarded
in
the
eyes
of
the
gods
and
of
men
of
understanding
also
to
be
soothed
and
gently
and
reverently
entreated
when
angry
even
more
than
a
father
and
either
to
be
persuaded
or
if
not
persuaded
to
be
obeyed
and
when
we
are
punished
by
her
whether
with
imprisonment
or
stripes
the
punishment
is
to
be
endured
in
silence
and
if
she
lead
us
to
wounds
or
death
in
battle
thither
we
follow
as
is
right
neither
may
any
one
yield
or
retreat
or
leave
his
rank
but
whether
in
battle
or
in
a
court
of
law
or
in
any
other
place
he
must
do
what
his
city
and
his
country
order
him
or
he
must
change
their
view
of
what
is
just
and
if
he
may
do
no
violence
to
his
father
or
mother
much
less
may
he
do
violence
to
his
country
what
answer
shall
we
make
to
this
crito
do
the
laws
speak
truly
or
do
they
not
crito
i
think
that
they
do
socrates
then
the
laws
will
say
socrates
if
we
are
speaking
truly
that
in
your
present
attempt
you
are
going
to
do
us
an
injury
for
having
brought
you
into
the
world
and
nurtured
and
educated
you
and
given
you
and
every
other
citizen
a
share
in
every
good
which
we
had
to
give
we
further
proclaim
to
any
athenian
by
the
liberty
which
we
allow
him
that
if
he
does
not
like
us
when
he
has
become
of
age
and
has
seen
the
ways
of
the
city
and
made
our
acquaintance
he
may
go
where
he
pleases
and
take
his
goods
with
him
none
of
us
laws
will
forbid
him
or
interfere
with
him
any
one
who
does
not
like
us
and
the
city
and
who
wants
to
emigrate
to
a
colony
or
to
any
other
city
may
go
where
he
likes
retaining
his
property
but
he
who
has
experience
of
the
manner
in
which
we
order
justice
and
administer
the
state
and
still
remains
has
entered
into
an
implied
contract
that
he
will
do
as
we
command
him
and
he
who
disobeys
us
is
as
we
maintain
thrice
wrong
first
because
in
disobeying
us
he
is
disobeying
his
parents
secondly
because
we
are
the
authors
of
his
education
thirdly
because
he
has
made
an
agreement
with
us
that
he
will
duly
obey
our
commands
and
he
neither
obeys
them
nor
convinces
us
that
our
commands
are
unjust
and
we
do
not
rudely
impose
them
but
give
him
the
alternative
of
obeying
or
convincing
us
that
is
what
we
offer
and
he
does
neither
are
the
sort
of
accusations
to
which
as
we
were
saying
you
socrates
will
be
exposed
if
you
accomplish
your
intentions
you
above
all
other
athenians
suppose
now
i
ask
why
i
rather
than
anybody
else
they
will
justly
retort
upon
me
that
i
above
all
other
men
have
acknowledged
the
agreement
is
clear
proof
they
will
say
that
we
and
the
city
were
not
displeasing
to
you
of
all
athenians
you
have
been
the
most
constant
resident
in
the
city
which
as
you
never
leave
you
may
be
supposed
to
love
compare
for
you
never
went
out
of
the
city
either
to
see
the
games
except
once
when
you
went
to
the
isthmus
or
to
any
other
place
unless
when
you
were
on
military
service
nor
did
you
travel
as
other
men
do
nor
had
you
any
curiosity
to
know
other
states
or
their
laws
your
affections
did
not
go
beyond
us
and
our
state
we
were
your
especial
favourites
and
you
acquiesced
in
our
government
of
you
and
here
in
this
city
you
begat
your
children
which
is
a
proof
of
your
satisfaction
moreover
you
might
in
the
course
of
the
trial
if
you
had
liked
have
fixed
the
penalty
at
banishment
the
state
which
refuses
to
let
you
go
now
would
have
let
you
go
then
but
you
pretended
that
you
preferred
death
to
exile
compare
apol
and
that
you
were
not
unwilling
to
die
and
now
you
have
forgotten
these
fine
sentiments
and
pay
no
respect
to
us
the
laws
of
whom
you
are
the
destroyer
and
are
doing
what
only
a
miserable
slave
would
do
running
away
and
turning
your
back
upon
the
compacts
and
agreements
which
you
made
as
a
citizen
and
first
of
all
answer
this
very
question
are
we
right
in
saying
that
you
agreed
to
be
governed
according
to
us
in
deed
and
not
in
word
only
is
that
true
or
not
how
shall
we
answer
crito
must
we
not
assent
crito
we
can
not
help
it
socrates
socrates
then
will
they
not
say
socrates
are
breaking
the
covenants
and
agreements
which
you
made
with
us
at
your
leisure
not
in
any
haste
or
under
any
compulsion
or
deception
but
after
you
have
had
seventy
years
to
think
of
them
during
which
time
you
were
at
liberty
to
leave
the
city
if
we
were
not
to
your
mind
or
if
our
covenants
appeared
to
you
to
be
unfair
you
had
your
choice
and
might
have
gone
either
to
lacedaemon
or
crete
both
which
states
are
often
praised
by
you
for
their
good
government
or
to
some
other
hellenic
or
foreign
state
whereas
you
above
all
other
athenians
seemed
to
be
so
fond
of
the
state
or
in
other
words
of
us
her
laws
and
who
would
care
about
a
state
which
has
no
laws
that
you
never
stirred
out
of
her
the
halt
the
blind
the
maimed
were
not
more
stationary
in
her
than
you
were
and
now
you
run
away
and
forsake
your
agreements
not
so
socrates
if
you
will
take
our
advice
do
not
make
yourself
ridiculous
by
escaping
out
of
the
city
just
consider
if
you
transgress
and
err
in
this
sort
of
way
what
good
will
you
do
either
to
yourself
or
to
your
friends
that
your
friends
will
be
driven
into
exile
and
deprived
of
citizenship
or
will
lose
their
property
is
tolerably
certain
and
you
yourself
if
you
fly
to
one
of
the
neighbouring
cities
as
for
example
thebes
or
megara
both
of
which
are
well
governed
will
come
to
them
as
an
enemy
socrates
and
their
government
will
be
against
you
and
all
patriotic
citizens
will
cast
an
evil
eye
upon
you
as
a
subverter
of
the
laws
and
you
will
confirm
in
the
minds
of
the
judges
the
justice
of
their
own
condemnation
of
you
for
he
who
is
a
corrupter
of
the
laws
is
more
than
likely
to
be
a
corrupter
of
the
young
and
foolish
portion
of
mankind
will
you
then
flee
from
cities
and
virtuous
men
and
is
existence
worth
having
on
these
terms
or
will
you
go
to
them
without
shame
and
talk
to
them
socrates
and
what
will
you
say
to
them
what
you
say
here
about
virtue
and
justice
and
institutions
and
laws
being
the
best
things
among
men
would
that
be
decent
of
you
surely
not
but
if
you
go
away
from
states
to
crito
friends
in
thessaly
where
there
is
great
disorder
and
licence
they
will
be
charmed
to
hear
the
tale
of
your
escape
from
prison
set
off
with
ludicrous
particulars
of
the
manner
in
which
you
were
wrapped
in
a
goatskin
or
some
other
disguise
and
metamorphosed
as
the
manner
is
of
runaways
but
will
there
be
no
one
to
remind
you
that
in
your
old
age
you
were
not
ashamed
to
violate
the
most
sacred
laws
from
a
miserable
desire
of
a
little
more
life
perhaps
not
if
you
keep
them
in
a
good
temper
but
if
they
are
out
of
temper
you
will
hear
many
degrading
things
you
will
live
but
how
as
the
flatterer
of
all
men
and
the
servant
of
all
men
and
doing
what
eating
and
drinking
in
thessaly
having
gone
abroad
in
order
that
you
may
get
a
dinner
and
where
will
be
your
fine
sentiments
about
justice
and
virtue
say
that
you
wish
to
live
for
the
sake
of
your
children
you
want
to
bring
them
up
and
educate
them
will
you
take
them
into
thessaly
and
deprive
them
of
athenian
citizenship
is
this
the
benefit
which
you
will
confer
upon
them
or
are
you
under
the
impression
that
they
will
be
better
cared
for
and
educated
here
if
you
are
still
alive
although
absent
from
them
for
your
friends
will
take
care
of
them
do
you
fancy
that
if
you
are
an
inhabitant
of
thessaly
they
will
take
care
of
them
and
if
you
are
an
inhabitant
of
the
other
world
that
they
will
not
take
care
of
them
nay
but
if
they
who
call
themselves
friends
are
good
for
anything
they
will
to
be
sure
they
will
then
socrates
to
us
who
have
brought
you
up
think
not
of
life
and
children
first
and
of
justice
afterwards
but
of
justice
first
that
you
may
be
justified
before
the
princes
of
the
world
below
for
neither
will
you
nor
any
that
belong
to
you
be
happier
or
holier
or
juster
in
this
life
or
happier
in
another
if
you
do
as
crito
bids
now
you
depart
in
innocence
a
sufferer
and
not
a
doer
of
evil
a
victim
not
of
the
laws
but
of
men
but
if
you
go
forth
returning
evil
for
evil
and
injury
for
injury
breaking
the
covenants
and
agreements
which
you
have
made
with
us
and
wronging
those
whom
you
ought
least
of
all
to
wrong
that
is
to
say
yourself
your
friends
your
country
and
us
we
shall
be
angry
with
you
while
you
live
and
our
brethren
the
laws
in
the
world
below
will
receive
you
as
an
enemy
for
they
will
know
that
you
have
done
your
best
to
destroy
us
listen
then
to
us
and
not
to
crito
this
dear
crito
is
the
voice
which
i
seem
to
hear
murmuring
in
my
ears
like
the
sound
of
the
flute
in
the
ears
of
the
mystic
that
voice
i
say
is
humming
in
my
ears
and
prevents
me
from
hearing
any
other
and
i
know
that
anything
more
which
you
may
say
will
be
vain
yet
speak
if
you
have
anything
to
say
crito
i
have
nothing
to
say
socrates
socrates
leave
me
then
crito
to
fulfil
the
will
of
god
and
to
follow
whither
he
leads
