station
life
in
new
zealand
by
lady
barker
preface
these
letters
their
writer
is
aware
justly
incur
the
reproach
of
egotism
and
triviality
at
the
same
time
she
did
not
see
how
this
was
to
be
avoided
without
lessening
their
value
as
the
exact
account
of
a
lady
experience
of
the
brighter
and
less
practical
side
of
colonization
they
are
published
as
no
guide
or
handbook
for
the
intending
emigrant
that
person
has
already
a
literature
to
himself
and
will
scarcely
find
here
so
much
as
a
single
statistic
they
simply
record
the
expeditions
adventures
and
emergencies
diversifying
the
daily
life
of
the
wife
of
a
new
zealand
and
as
each
was
written
while
the
novelty
and
excitement
of
the
scenes
it
describes
were
fresh
upon
her
they
may
succeed
in
giving
here
in
england
an
adequate
impression
of
the
delight
and
freedom
of
an
existence
so
far
removed
from
our
own
civilization
not
failing
in
this
the
writer
will
gladly
bear
the
burden
of
any
critical
rebuke
the
letters
deserve
one
thing
she
hopes
will
plainly
appear
that
however
hard
it
was
to
part
by
the
width
of
the
whole
earth
from
dear
friends
and
spots
scarcely
less
dear
yet
she
soon
found
in
that
new
country
new
friends
and
a
new
home
costing
her
in
their
turn
almost
as
many
parting
regrets
as
the
old
b
letter
i
two
months
at
sea
melbourne
port
phillip
hotel
melbourne
september
now
i
must
give
you
an
account
of
our
voyage
it
has
been
a
very
quick
one
for
the
immense
distance
traversed
sometimes
under
canvas
but
generally
steaming
we
saw
no
land
between
the
lizard
and
cape
otway
light
that
is
for
days
and
oh
the
monotony
of
that
time
the
monotony
of
it
our
decks
were
so
crowded
that
we
divided
our
walking
hours
in
order
that
each
set
of
passengers
might
have
space
to
move
about
for
if
every
one
had
taken
it
into
their
heads
to
exercise
themselves
at
the
same
time
we
could
hardly
have
exceeded
the
fisherman
definition
of
a
walk
two
steps
and
overboard
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
was
more
or
less
ill
all
the
way
but
fortunately
f
was
not
and
i
rejoiced
at
this
from
the
most
selfish
motives
as
he
was
able
to
take
care
of
me
i
find
that
develops
the
worst
part
of
one
character
with
startling
rapidity
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
look
back
with
upon
my
callous
indifference
to
the
sufferings
of
others
and
apathetic
absorption
in
my
individual
misery
until
we
had
fairly
embarked
the
but
ignorant
among
our
friends
constantly
assured
us
with
an
air
of
conviction
as
to
the
truth
and
wisdom
of
their
words
that
we
were
going
at
the
very
best
season
of
the
year
but
as
soon
as
we
could
gather
the
opinions
of
those
in
authority
on
board
it
gradually
leaked
out
that
we
really
had
fallen
upon
quite
a
wrong
time
for
such
a
voyage
for
we
very
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
tropics
during
their
hottest
month
early
in
august
and
after
having
been
nearly
roasted
for
three
weeks
we
plunged
abruptly
into
or
at
all
events
very
early
spring
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
went
through
a
season
of
bitterly
cold
weather
with
three
heavy
gales
i
pitied
the
poor
sailors
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
at
their
work
all
night
on
decks
slippery
with
ice
and
pulling
at
ropes
so
frozen
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
bend
them
but
thank
god
there
were
no
casualties
among
the
men
the
last
gale
was
the
most
severe
they
said
it
was
the
tail
of
a
cyclone
one
is
apt
on
land
to
regard
such
phrases
as
the
shriek
of
the
storm
or
the
roar
of
the
waves
as
poetical
hyperboles
whereas
they
are
very
literal
and
expressive
renderings
of
the
sounds
of
horror
incessant
throughout
a
gale
at
sea
our
cabin
though
very
nice
and
comfortable
in
other
respects
possessed
an
extraordinary
attraction
for
any
stray
wave
which
might
be
wandering
about
the
saloon
once
or
twice
i
have
been
in
the
cuddy
when
a
sea
found
its
way
down
the
companion
and
i
have
watched
with
horrible
anxiety
a
ton
or
so
of
water
hesitating
which
cabin
it
should
enter
and
deluge
and
it
always
seemed
to
choose
ours
all
these
miseries
appear
now
after
even
a
few
days
of
the
blessed
land
to
belong
to
a
distant
past
but
i
feel
inclined
to
lay
my
pen
down
and
have
a
hearty
laugh
at
the
recollection
of
one
cold
night
when
a
heavy
thud
burst
open
our
cabin
door
and
washed
out
all
the
stray
parcels
boots
from
the
corners
in
which
the
rolling
of
the
ship
had
previously
bestowed
them
i
was
high
and
dry
in
the
top
berth
but
poor
f
in
the
lower
recess
was
awakened
by
the
douche
and
no
words
of
mine
can
convey
to
you
the
utter
absurdity
of
his
appearance
as
he
nimbly
mounted
on
the
top
of
a
chest
of
drawers
close
by
and
crouched
there
wet
and
shivering
handing
me
up
a
most
miscellaneous
assortment
of
goods
to
take
care
of
in
my
little
dry
nest
some
of
our
were
very
and
devoted
themselves
to
cheering
and
enlivening
us
by
getting
up
concerts
little
burlesques
and
other
amusements
and
very
grateful
we
were
for
their
efforts
they
say
that
anything
is
fun
in
the
country
but
on
board
ship
a
little
wit
goes
a
very
long
way
indeed
for
all
are
only
too
ready
and
anxious
to
be
amused
the
whole
dramatic
strength
of
the
company
was
called
into
force
for
the
performance
of
the
rivals
which
was
given
a
week
or
so
before
the
end
of
the
voyage
it
went
off
wonderfully
well
but
i
confess
i
enjoyed
the
preparations
more
than
the
play
itself
the
ingenuity
displayed
was
very
amusing
at
the
time
you
on
shore
can
not
imagine
how
difficult
it
was
to
find
a
for
sir
anthony
absolute
or
with
what
joy
and
admiration
we
welcomed
a
clever
substitute
for
it
in
the
shape
of
a
covered
with
the
lead
out
of
a
most
ingeniously
modelled
into
an
embossed
wreath
round
the
lid
with
a
bunch
of
leaves
and
buds
in
the
centre
the
whole
being
brightly
burnished
at
the
performance
the
effect
of
this
little
property
was
really
excellent
then
at
the
last
moment
poor
bob
acres
had
to
give
in
and
acknowledge
that
he
could
not
speak
for
coughing
he
had
been
suffering
from
bronchitis
for
some
days
past
but
had
gallantly
striven
to
make
himself
heard
at
rehearsals
so
on
the
day
of
the
play
f
had
the
part
forced
on
him
there
was
no
time
to
learn
his
words
so
he
wrote
out
all
of
them
in
large
letters
on
slips
of
paper
and
fastened
them
on
the
beams
this
device
was
invisible
to
the
audience
but
he
was
obliged
to
go
through
his
scenes
with
his
head
as
high
up
as
if
he
had
on
a
martingale
however
we
were
all
so
indulgent
that
at
any
little
such
as
one
of
the
actresses
forgetting
her
part
or
being
seized
by
the
applause
was
much
greater
than
when
things
went
smoothly
i
can
hardly
believe
that
it
is
only
two
days
since
we
steamed
into
hobson
bay
on
a
lovely
bright
spring
morning
at
dinner
the
evening
before
our
dear
old
captain
had
said
that
we
should
see
the
revolving
light
on
the
nearest
headland
about
eight
that
evening
and
so
we
did
you
will
not
think
me
childish
if
i
acknowledge
that
my
eyes
were
so
full
of
tears
i
could
hardly
see
it
after
the
first
glimpse
it
is
impossible
to
express
in
a
letter
all
the
joy
and
thankfulness
of
such
a
moment
feelings
like
these
are
forgotten
only
too
quickly
in
the
jar
and
bustle
of
daily
life
and
we
are
always
ready
to
take
as
a
matter
of
course
those
mercies
which
are
new
every
morning
but
when
i
realized
that
all
the
tosses
and
tumbles
of
so
many
weary
days
and
nights
were
over
and
that
at
last
we
had
reached
the
haven
where
we
would
be
my
first
thought
was
one
of
deep
gratitude
it
was
easy
to
see
that
it
was
a
good
moment
with
everyone
squabbles
were
made
up
with
surprising
quickness
shy
people
grew
suddenly
sociable
some
who
had
comfortable
homes
to
go
to
on
landing
gave
kind
and
welcome
invitations
to
others
who
felt
themselves
sadly
strange
in
a
new
country
and
it
was
with
really
a
lingering
feeling
of
regret
that
we
all
separated
at
last
though
a
very
short
time
before
we
should
have
thought
it
quite
impossible
to
be
anything
but
delighted
to
leave
the
ship
we
have
not
seen
much
of
melbourne
yet
as
there
has
been
a
great
deal
to
do
in
looking
after
the
luggage
and
at
first
one
is
capable
of
nothing
but
a
delightful
idleness
the
keenest
enjoyment
is
a
bath
and
next
to
that
is
the
new
and
agreeable
luxury
of
the
ample
space
for
dressing
and
then
it
is
so
pleasant
to
suffer
no
anxiety
as
to
the
brushes
and
combs
tumbling
about
i
should
think
that
even
the
vainest
woman
in
the
world
would
find
her
toilet
and
its
duties
a
daily
trouble
and
a
sorrow
at
sea
on
account
of
the
unsteadiness
of
all
things
the
next
delight
is
standing
at
the
window
and
seeing
horses
and
trees
and
dogs
in
fact
all
the
treasures
of
the
land
as
for
flowers
beautiful
as
they
are
at
all
times
you
can
not
learn
to
appreciate
them
enough
until
you
have
been
deprived
of
them
for
two
months
you
know
that
i
have
travelled
a
good
deal
in
various
parts
of
the
world
but
i
have
never
seen
anything
at
all
like
melbourne
in
other
countries
it
is
generally
the
antiquity
of
the
cities
and
their
historical
reminiscences
which
appeal
to
the
imagination
but
the
interest
is
as
great
from
exactly
the
opposite
cause
it
is
most
wonderful
to
walk
through
a
splendid
town
with
magnificent
public
buildings
churches
shops
clubs
theatres
with
the
streets
well
paved
and
lighted
and
to
think
that
less
than
forty
years
ago
it
was
a
desolate
swamp
without
even
a
hut
upon
it
how
little
an
english
country
town
progresses
in
forty
years
and
here
is
a
splendid
city
created
in
that
time
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
any
fashionable
novelty
which
comes
out
in
either
london
or
paris
finds
its
way
to
melbourne
by
the
next
steamer
for
instance
i
broke
my
parasol
on
board
ship
and
the
first
thing
i
did
on
landing
was
to
go
to
one
of
the
best
shops
in
collins
street
to
replace
it
on
learning
what
i
wanted
the
shopman
showed
me
some
of
those
new
parasols
which
had
just
come
out
in
london
before
i
sailed
and
which
i
had
vainly
tried
to
procure
in
s
only
four
hours
from
london
the
only
public
place
we
have
yet
visited
is
the
acclimatization
garden
which
is
very
beautifully
laid
out
and
full
of
aviaries
though
it
looks
strange
to
see
common
english
birds
treated
as
distinguished
visitors
and
sumptuously
lodged
and
cared
for
naturally
the
australian
ones
interest
me
most
and
they
are
certainly
prettier
than
yours
at
home
though
they
do
not
sing
i
have
been
already
to
a
shop
where
they
sell
skins
of
birds
and
have
half
ruined
myself
in
purchases
for
hats
you
are
to
have
a
diamond
sparrow
a
dear
little
fellow
with
reddish
brown
plumage
and
white
spots
over
its
body
in
this
respect
a
miniature
copy
of
the
argus
pheasant
i
brought
from
india
and
a
triangular
patch
of
bright
yellow
under
its
throat
i
saw
some
of
them
alive
in
a
cage
in
the
market
with
many
other
kinds
of
small
birds
and
several
pairs
of
those
pretty
grass
or
zebra
paroquets
which
are
called
here
by
the
very
inharmonious
name
of
budgerighars
i
admired
the
blue
wren
so
much
a
tiny
with
tail
and
body
of
feathers
and
head
and
throat
of
a
most
lovely
turquoise
blue
it
has
also
a
little
wattle
of
these
blue
feathers
standing
straight
out
on
each
side
of
its
head
which
gives
it
a
very
pert
appearance
then
there
is
the
all
but
quaint
with
the
sticking
up
on
end
and
exactly
like
those
of
an
emu
on
the
very
smallest
scale
even
to
the
peculiarity
of
two
feathers
growing
out
of
the
same
little
quill
i
was
much
amused
by
the
varieties
of
cockatoos
parrots
and
lories
of
every
kind
and
colour
shrieking
and
jabbering
in
the
part
of
the
market
devoted
to
them
but
i
am
told
that
i
have
seen
very
few
of
the
varieties
of
birds
as
it
is
early
in
the
spring
and
the
young
ones
have
not
yet
been
brought
in
they
appear
to
sell
as
fast
as
they
can
be
procured
but
before
i
end
my
letter
i
must
tell
you
about
the
cockatoo
belonging
to
this
hotel
it
is
a
famous
bird
in
its
way
having
had
its
portrait
taken
several
times
descriptions
written
for
newspapers
of
its
talents
and
its
owner
boasts
of
enormous
sums
offered
and
refused
for
it
knowing
my
fondness
for
pets
f
took
me
downstairs
to
see
it
very
soon
after
our
arrival
i
thought
it
hideous
it
belongs
to
a
kind
not
very
well
known
in
england
of
a
dirtyish
white
colour
a
very
head
and
bill
and
large
bluish
rings
round
the
eyes
the
beak
is
huge
and
curved
if
it
knew
of
this
last
objection
on
my
part
it
would
probably
answer
like
the
wolf
in
red
riding
story
the
better
to
talk
with
my
dear
for
it
is
a
weird
and
knowing
bird
at
first
it
flatly
refused
to
show
off
any
of
its
accomplishments
but
one
of
the
hotel
servants
came
forward
and
cocky
condescended
to
go
through
his
performances
i
can
not
you
of
all
its
antics
it
pretended
to
have
a
violent
toothache
and
nursed
its
beak
in
its
claw
rocking
itself
backwards
and
forwards
as
if
in
the
greatest
agony
and
in
answer
to
all
the
remedies
which
were
proposed
croaking
out
oh
it
ai
a
bit
of
good
and
finally
sidling
up
to
the
edge
of
its
perch
and
saying
in
hoarse
but
confidential
whisper
give
us
a
drop
of
whisky
its
voice
was
extraordinarily
distinct
and
when
it
sang
several
snatches
of
songs
the
words
were
capitally
given
with
the
most
absurdly
comic
intonation
all
the
being
executed
in
perfect
tune
i
liked
its
sewing
performance
so
much
to
see
it
hold
a
little
piece
of
stuff
underneath
the
claw
which
rested
on
the
perch
and
pretend
to
sew
with
the
other
getting
into
difficulties
with
its
thread
and
finally
setting
up
a
loud
song
in
praise
of
just
as
if
it
were
an
advertisement
by
the
next
time
i
write
i
shall
have
seen
more
of
melbourne
there
will
however
be
no
time
for
another
letter
by
this
mail
but
i
will
leave
one
to
be
posted
after
we
sail
for
new
zealand
letter
ii
in
melbourne
melbourne
october
i
have
left
my
letter
to
the
last
moment
before
starting
for
lyttleton
everything
is
and
ready
and
we
sail
morning
in
the
she
is
a
very
small
after
our
large
vessel
but
she
looks
clean
and
tidy
at
all
events
we
hope
to
be
only
on
board
her
for
ten
days
in
england
one
fancies
that
new
zealand
is
quite
close
to
australia
so
i
was
rather
disgusted
to
find
we
had
another
thousand
miles
of
steaming
to
do
before
we
could
reach
our
new
home
and
one
of
the
many
job
comforters
who
are
scattered
up
and
down
the
world
assures
me
that
the
navigation
is
the
most
dangerous
and
difficult
of
the
whole
voyage
we
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
melbourne
this
week
and
not
only
of
the
town
for
we
have
had
many
drives
in
the
exceedingly
pretty
suburbs
owing
to
the
kindness
of
the
d
s
who
have
been
most
hospitable
and
made
our
visit
here
delightful
we
drove
out
to
their
house
at
toorak
three
or
four
times
and
spent
a
long
afternoon
with
them
and
there
i
began
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
antipodean
trees
and
flowers
i
hope
you
will
not
think
it
a
very
sweeping
assertion
if
i
say
that
all
the
leaves
look
as
if
they
were
made
of
leather
but
it
really
is
so
the
hot
winds
appear
to
parch
up
everything
at
all
events
round
melbourne
till
the
greatest
charm
of
foliage
is
more
or
less
lost
the
flowers
also
look
withered
and
burnt
up
as
yours
do
at
the
end
of
a
long
dry
summer
only
they
assume
this
appearance
after
the
first
hot
wind
in
spring
the
suburb
called
heidelberg
is
the
prettiest
to
my
taste
an
undulating
country
with
vineyards
and
a
appearance
which
is
very
charming
all
round
melbourne
there
are
nice
comfortable
villas
at
one
of
these
we
called
to
return
a
visit
and
found
a
very
handsome
house
luxuriously
furnished
with
beautiful
garden
and
grounds
one
afternoon
we
went
by
rail
to
kilda
a
flourishing
on
the
about
six
miles
from
melbourne
everywhere
building
is
going
on
with
great
rapidity
and
you
do
not
see
any
poor
people
in
the
streets
if
i
wanted
to
be
critical
and
find
fault
i
might
object
to
the
deep
gutters
on
each
side
of
the
road
after
a
shower
of
rain
they
are
raging
torrents
for
a
short
time
through
which
you
are
obliged
to
splash
without
regard
to
the
muddy
consequences
and
even
when
they
are
dry
they
entail
sudden
and
prodigious
jolts
there
are
plenty
of
hansoms
and
all
sorts
of
other
conveyances
but
i
gave
f
no
peace
until
he
took
me
for
a
drive
in
a
vehicle
which
was
quite
new
to
me
a
sort
of
light
car
with
a
canopy
and
curtains
holding
four
two
on
each
seat
and
called
a
jingle
of
american
parentage
i
fancy
one
drive
in
this
carriage
was
quite
enough
however
and
i
contented
myself
with
hansoms
afterwards
but
walking
is
really
more
enjoyable
than
anything
else
after
having
been
so
long
cooped
up
on
board
ship
we
admired
the
fine
statue
at
the
top
of
collins
street
to
the
memory
of
the
two
most
famous
of
australian
explorers
burke
and
wills
and
made
many
visits
to
the
museum
and
the
glorious
free
library
we
also
went
all
over
the
houses
of
legislature
very
new
and
grand
but
you
must
not
despise
me
if
i
confess
to
having
enjoyed
the
shops
exceedingly
it
was
so
unlike
a
jeweller
shop
in
england
to
see
on
the
counter
gold
in
its
raw
state
in
nuggets
and
dust
and
flakes
in
this
stage
of
its
existence
it
certainly
deserves
its
name
of
filthy
lucre
for
it
is
often
only
half
washed
there
were
quantities
of
emus
eggs
in
the
silversmiths
shops
mounted
in
every
conceivable
way
as
cups
and
vases
and
even
as
some
designs
consisted
of
three
or
five
eggs
grouped
together
as
a
i
can
not
honestly
say
i
admired
any
of
them
they
were
generally
too
elaborate
comprising
often
a
native
spear
in
hand
a
kangaroo
palms
ferns
cockatoos
and
sometimes
an
emu
or
two
in
addition
as
a
pedestal
all
this
in
frosted
silver
or
gold
i
was
given
a
pair
of
these
eggs
before
leaving
england
they
were
mounted
in
london
as
little
in
a
setting
consisting
only
of
a
few
bulrushes
and
leaves
yet
far
better
than
any
of
these
florid
designs
but
he
are
very
popular
in
sydney
or
melbourne
and
i
am
told
sell
rapidly
to
people
going
home
who
take
them
as
a
memento
of
their
australian
life
and
probably
think
that
the
greater
the
number
of
reminiscences
suggested
by
the
ornament
the
more
satisfactory
it
is
as
a
purchase
i
must
finish
my
letter
by
a
description
of
a
which
about
a
dozen
of
our
joined
with
us
in
giving
our
dear
old
captain
before
we
all
separated
whilst
we
were
on
board
it
very
often
happened
that
the
food
was
not
very
choice
or
good
at
all
events
we
used
sometimes
to
grumble
at
it
and
we
generally
wound
up
our
lamentations
by
agreeing
that
when
we
reached
melbourne
we
would
have
a
good
dinner
together
looking
back
on
it
i
must
say
i
think
we
were
all
rather
greedy
but
we
tried
to
give
a
better
colouring
to
our
gourmandism
by
inviting
the
captain
who
was
universally
popular
and
by
making
it
as
elegant
and
pretty
a
repast
as
possible
three
or
four
of
the
gentlemen
formed
themselves
into
a
committee
and
they
must
really
have
worked
very
hard
at
all
events
they
collected
everything
rare
and
strange
in
the
way
of
fish
flesh
and
fowl
peculiar
to
australia
the
arrangement
of
the
table
was
charming
and
the
delicacies
were
all
cooked
and
served
to
perfection
the
ladies
tastes
were
considered
in
the
profusion
of
flowers
and
we
each
found
an
exquisite
bouquet
by
our
plate
i
can
not
possibly
give
you
a
minute
account
of
the
whole
menu
in
fact
as
it
is
i
feel
rather
like
froissart
who
after
chronicling
a
long
list
of
sumptuous
dishes
is
not
ashamed
to
confess
of
all
which
good
things
i
the
chronicler
of
this
narration
did
partake
the
soups
comprised
a
clear
soup
not
unlike
but
with
a
flavour
of
game
i
wish
i
could
recollect
the
names
of
the
fish
the
ones
came
a
long
distance
by
rail
from
the
river
murray
but
were
excellent
nevertheless
the
last
thing
which
i
can
remember
tasting
for
one
really
could
do
little
else
was
a
most
exquisite
morsel
of
pigeon
more
like
a
quail
than
anything
else
in
flavour
i
am
not
a
judge
of
wine
as
you
may
imagine
therefore
it
is
no
unkindness
to
the
owners
of
the
beautiful
vineyards
which
we
saw
the
other
day
to
say
that
i
do
not
like
the
australian
wines
some
of
the
gentlemen
pronounced
them
to
be
excellent
especially
the
equivalent
to
sauterne
which
has
a
wonderful
native
name
impossible
to
write
down
but
as
i
said
before
i
do
not
like
the
rather
rough
flavour
we
had
not
a
great
variety
of
fruit
at
dessert
indeed
sydney
oranges
constituted
its
main
feature
as
it
is
too
late
for
winter
fruits
and
too
early
for
summer
ones
but
we
were
not
inclined
to
be
and
thought
everything
delicious
letter
iii
on
to
new
zealand
christchurch
canterbury
october
as
you
so
particularly
desired
me
when
we
parted
to
tell
you
i
must
resume
my
story
where
in
my
last
letter
i
left
it
off
if
i
remember
rightly
i
ended
with
an
attempt
at
describing
our
great
feast
we
embarked
the
next
day
and
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
the
bay
the
little
plunged
into
heavy
seas
the
motion
was
much
worse
in
her
than
on
board
the
large
vessel
we
had
been
so
glad
to
leave
and
all
my
previous
sufferings
seemed
insignificant
compared
with
what
i
endured
in
my
small
and
wretchedly
hard
berth
i
have
a
dim
recollection
of
f
helping
me
to
dress
wrapping
me
up
in
various
shawls
and
half
carrying
me
up
the
companion
ladder
i
crawled
into
a
sunny
corner
among
the
boxes
of
oranges
with
which
the
deck
was
crowded
and
there
i
lay
helpless
and
utterly
miserable
one
and
asked
f
if
i
was
fond
of
birds
and
on
his
saying
yes
went
off
for
a
large
wicker
cage
of
hideous
laughing
jackasses
which
he
was
taking
as
a
great
treasure
to
canterbury
why
they
should
be
called
jackasses
i
never
could
discover
but
the
creatures
certainly
do
utter
by
fits
and
starts
a
sound
which
may
fairly
be
described
as
laughter
these
paroxysms
arise
from
no
cause
that
one
can
perceive
one
bird
begins
and
all
the
others
join
in
and
a
more
doleful
and
depressing
chorus
i
never
heard
early
in
the
morning
seemed
the
favourite
time
for
this
discordant
mirth
their
owner
also
possessed
a
cockatoo
with
a
great
musical
reputation
but
i
never
heard
it
get
beyond
the
first
bar
of
come
into
the
garden
maud
ill
as
i
was
i
remember
being
roused
to
something
like
a
flicker
of
animation
when
i
was
shown
an
exceedingly
seedy
and
blackbird
with
a
broken
leg
in
splints
which
its
master
the
same
gentleman
assured
me
he
had
bought
in
melbourne
as
a
great
bargain
for
only
pounds
shillings
after
five
days
steaming
we
arrived
in
the
open
roadstead
of
hokitika
on
the
west
coast
of
the
middle
island
of
new
zealand
and
five
minutes
after
the
anchor
was
down
a
little
tug
came
alongside
to
take
away
our
steerage
passengers
three
hundred
diggers
the
on
this
coast
were
only
discovered
eight
months
ago
and
already
several
canvas
towns
have
sprung
up
there
are
thirty
thousand
diggers
at
work
and
every
vessel
brings
a
fresh
cargo
of
stalwart
men
it
was
rather
late
and
getting
dark
but
still
i
could
distinctly
see
the
picturesque
tents
in
the
deep
mountain
gorge
their
white
shapes
dotted
here
and
there
as
far
back
from
the
shore
as
my
sight
could
follow
and
the
wreaths
of
smoke
curling
up
in
all
directions
from
the
evening
fires
it
is
still
bitterly
cold
at
night
being
very
early
spring
the
river
hokitika
washes
down
with
every
fresh
such
quantities
of
sand
that
a
bar
is
continually
forming
in
this
roadstead
and
though
only
vessels
of
the
least
possible
draught
are
engaged
in
the
still
wrecks
are
of
frequent
occurrence
we
ought
to
have
landed
our
thousands
of
oranges
here
but
this
work
was
necessarily
deferred
till
the
morning
for
it
was
as
much
as
they
could
do
to
get
all
the
diggers
and
their
belongings
safely
ashore
before
dark
in
the
middle
of
the
night
one
of
the
sudden
and
furious
gales
common
to
these
seas
sprang
up
and
would
soon
have
driven
us
on
the
rocks
if
we
had
not
got
our
steam
up
quickly
and
struggled
out
to
sea
oranges
and
all
and
away
to
nelson
on
the
north
coast
of
the
same
island
here
we
landed
the
seventh
day
after
leaving
melbourne
and
spent
a
few
hours
wandering
about
on
shore
it
is
a
lovely
little
town
as
i
saw
it
that
spring
morning
with
hills
running
down
almost
to
the
water
edge
and
small
wooden
houses
with
gables
and
verandahs
half
buried
in
creepers
built
up
the
sides
of
the
steep
slopes
it
was
a
true
new
zealand
day
still
and
bright
a
delicious
invigorating
freshness
in
the
air
without
the
least
chill
the
sky
of
a
more
than
italian
blue
the
ranges
of
mountains
in
the
distance
covered
with
snow
and
standing
out
sharp
and
clear
against
this
lovely
glowing
heaven
the
town
itself
i
must
say
seemed
very
dull
and
stagnant
with
little
sign
of
life
or
activity
about
it
but
nothing
can
be
prettier
or
more
picturesque
than
its
situation
not
unlike
that
of
a
swiss
village
our
day
came
to
an
end
all
too
soon
and
we
for
wellington
the
most
southern
town
of
the
north
island
the
seat
of
government
is
there
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
very
thriving
place
but
is
not
nearly
so
well
situated
as
nelson
nor
so
attractive
to
strangers
we
landed
and
walked
about
a
good
deal
and
saw
what
little
there
was
to
see
at
first
i
thought
the
shops
very
handsome
but
i
found
rather
to
my
disgust
that
generally
the
fine
imposing
frontage
was
all
a
sham
the
actual
building
was
only
a
little
but
at
the
back
looking
all
the
meaner
for
the
contrast
to
the
cornices
and
show
windows
in
front
you
can
not
think
how
odd
it
was
to
turn
a
corner
and
see
that
the
building
was
only
one
board
in
thickness
and
scarcely
more
substantial
than
the
scenes
at
a
theatre
we
lunched
at
the
principal
hotel
where
f
was
much
amused
at
my
astonishment
at
colonial
prices
we
had
two
dozen
very
nice
little
oysters
and
he
had
a
glass
of
porter
for
this
modest
repast
we
paid
eleven
shillings
we
slept
on
board
had
another
walk
on
shore
after
breakfast
the
following
morning
and
about
twelve
set
off
for
lyttleton
the
final
end
of
our
voyaging
which
we
reached
in
about
twenty
hours
the
scenery
is
very
beautiful
all
along
the
coast
but
the
navigation
is
both
dangerous
and
difficult
it
was
exceedingly
cold
and
lyttleton
did
not
look
very
inviting
we
could
not
get
in
at
all
near
the
and
had
to
pay
pounds
to
be
rowed
ashore
in
an
open
boat
with
our
luggage
i
assure
you
it
was
a
very
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
we
passed
in
that
boat
getting
into
it
was
difficult
enough
the
spray
dashed
over
us
every
minute
and
by
the
time
we
landed
we
were
quite
drenched
but
a
good
fire
at
the
hotel
and
a
capital
lunch
soon
made
us
all
right
again
besides
in
the
delight
of
being
actually
at
the
end
of
our
voyage
no
annoyance
or
discomfort
was
worth
a
thought
f
had
a
couple
of
hours
work
rushing
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
custom
house
clearing
our
luggage
and
arranging
for
some
sort
of
conveyance
to
take
us
over
the
hills
the
great
tunnel
through
these
port
hills
which
divide
lyttleton
from
christchurch
the
capital
of
canterbury
is
only
half
finished
but
it
seems
wonderful
that
so
expensive
and
difficult
an
engineering
work
could
be
undertaken
by
such
an
infant
colony
at
last
a
sort
of
shabby
waggonette
was
forthcoming
and
about
three
we
started
from
lyttleton
and
almost
immediately
began
to
ascend
the
it
was
a
tremendous
pull
for
the
poor
horses
who
however
never
flinched
at
the
steepest
pinch
the
gentlemen
were
requested
to
get
out
and
walk
which
they
did
and
at
length
we
reached
the
top
it
was
worth
all
the
bad
road
to
look
down
on
the
bay
with
the
little
patches
of
cultivation
a
few
houses
nestling
in
pretty
recesses
the
town
of
lyttleton
seemed
much
more
imposing
and
important
as
we
rose
above
it
fifteen
years
ago
a
few
sheds
received
the
pilgrims
as
the
first
comers
are
always
called
i
like
the
name
it
is
so
pretty
and
suggestive
by
the
way
i
am
told
that
these
four
ships
sent
out
with
the
pilgrims
by
the
canterbury
association
sailed
together
from
england
parted
company
almost
directly
and
arrived
in
lyttleton
then
called
port
cooper
four
months
afterwards
on
the
same
day
having
all
experienced
fine
weather
but
never
having
sighted
each
other
once
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
the
driver
looked
to
the
harness
of
his
horses
put
on
a
very
powerful
double
break
and
we
began
the
descent
which
i
must
say
i
thought
we
took
much
too
quickly
especially
as
at
every
turn
of
the
road
some
little
anecdote
was
forthcoming
of
an
upset
or
accident
however
i
would
not
show
the
least
alarm
and
we
were
soon
rattling
along
the
sumner
road
by
the
passing
every
now
and
then
under
tremendous
overhanging
crags
in
half
an
hour
we
reached
sumner
itself
where
we
stopped
for
a
few
moments
to
change
horses
there
is
an
inn
and
a
village
here
where
people
from
christchurch
come
in
the
warm
weather
for
and
bathing
it
began
to
rain
hard
and
the
rest
of
the
journey
some
seven
or
eight
miles
was
disagreeable
enough
but
it
was
the
and
that
one
thought
was
sufficient
to
keep
us
radiantly
in
spite
of
all
little
trials
when
we
reached
christchurch
we
drove
at
once
to
a
sort
of
where
we
had
engaged
apartments
and
thought
of
nothing
but
supper
and
bed
the
next
day
people
began
calling
and
certainly
i
can
not
complain
of
any
coldness
or
want
of
welcome
to
my
new
home
i
like
what
i
have
seen
of
my
future
acquaintances
very
much
of
course
there
is
a
very
practical
style
and
tone
over
everything
though
outwardly
the
place
is
as
civilized
as
if
it
were
a
hundred
years
old
streets
gas
lamps
and
even
drinking
fountains
and
pillar
i
often
find
myself
wondering
whether
the
ladies
here
are
at
all
like
what
our
great
grandmothers
were
i
suspect
they
are
for
they
appear
to
possess
an
amount
of
useful
practical
knowledge
which
is
quite
astonishing
and
yet
know
how
to
surround
themselves
according
to
their
means
and
opportunities
with
the
refinements
and
elegancies
of
life
i
feel
quite
ashamed
of
my
own
utter
ignorance
on
every
subject
and
am
determined
to
set
to
work
directly
and
learn
at
all
events
i
shall
have
plenty
of
instructresses
christchurch
is
a
very
pretty
little
town
still
primitive
enough
to
be
picturesque
and
yet
very
thriving
capital
shops
where
everything
may
be
bought
churches
public
buildings
a
very
handsome
etc
most
of
the
houses
are
of
wood
but
when
they
are
burned
down
which
is
often
the
case
they
are
now
rebuilt
of
brick
or
stone
so
that
the
new
ones
are
nearly
all
of
these
more
solid
materials
i
am
disappointed
to
find
that
the
cathedral
of
which
i
had
heard
so
much
has
not
progressed
beyond
the
foundations
which
cost
pounds
all
the
works
have
been
stopped
and
certainly
there
is
not
much
to
show
for
so
large
a
sum
but
labour
is
very
dear
christchurch
is
a
great
deal
more
lively
and
bustling
than
most
english
country
towns
and
i
am
much
struck
by
the
healthy
appearance
of
the
people
there
are
no
paupers
to
be
seen
every
one
seems
well
fed
and
well
clothed
the
children
are
really
splendid
of
course
as
might
be
expected
there
is
a
great
deal
of
independence
in
bearing
and
manner
especially
among
the
servants
and
i
hear
astounding
stories
concerning
them
on
all
sides
my
next
letter
will
be
from
the
country
as
we
have
accepted
an
invitation
to
pay
a
visit
of
six
weeks
or
so
to
a
station
in
the
north
of
the
province
letter
iv
first
introduction
to
station
life
heathstock
canterbury
november
i
have
just
had
the
happiness
of
receiving
my
first
budget
of
english
letters
and
no
one
can
imagine
how
a
satisfactory
home
letter
satisfies
the
hunger
of
the
heart
after
its
loved
and
left
ones
your
letter
was
particularly
pleasant
because
i
could
perceive
as
i
held
the
paper
in
my
hands
that
you
were
writing
as
you
really
felt
and
that
you
were
indeed
happy
may
you
long
continue
so
dearest
f
says
that
this
beautiful
place
will
give
me
a
very
erroneous
impression
of
station
life
and
that
i
shall
probably
expect
to
find
its
comforts
and
luxuries
the
rule
whereas
they
are
the
exception
in
the
mean
time
however
i
am
enjoying
them
thoroughly
the
house
is
only
miles
from
christchurch
nearly
due
north
which
you
must
not
forget
answers
to
your
south
in
point
of
warmth
our
kind
friends
and
hosts
the
l
s
called
for
us
in
their
comfortable
and
large
break
with
four
horses
l
drove
f
sat
on
the
box
and
inside
were
the
ladies
children
and
a
nurse
our
first
stage
was
to
kaiapoi
a
little
town
on
the
river
waimakiriri
where
we
had
a
good
luncheon
of
whitebait
and
rested
and
fed
the
horses
from
the
window
of
the
hotel
i
saw
a
few
groups
of
maories
they
looked
very
ugly
and
peaceable
with
a
rude
sort
of
basket
made
of
flax
fibres
or
buckets
filled
with
whitebait
which
they
wanted
us
to
buy
there
are
some
reserved
lands
near
kaiapoi
where
they
have
a
very
thriving
settlement
living
in
perfect
peace
and
with
their
white
neighbours
when
we
set
off
again
on
our
journey
we
passed
a
little
for
their
children
we
reached
leathfield
that
evening
only
miles
from
christchurch
found
a
nice
inn
or
as
roadside
inns
are
called
here
had
a
capital
supper
and
comfortable
beds
and
were
up
and
off
again
at
daylight
the
next
morning
as
far
as
the
weka
pass
where
we
stopped
for
dinner
the
roads
were
very
good
but
after
that
we
got
more
among
the
hills
and
off
the
usual
track
and
there
were
many
sharp
turns
and
steep
pinches
but
l
is
an
excellent
whip
and
took
great
care
of
us
we
all
got
very
weary
towards
the
end
of
this
second
day
journey
and
the
last
two
hours
of
it
were
in
heavy
rain
it
was
growing
very
dark
when
we
reached
the
gate
and
heard
the
welcome
sound
of
gravel
under
the
wheels
i
could
just
perceive
that
we
had
entered
a
plantation
the
first
trees
since
we
left
christchurch
nothing
seems
so
wonderful
to
me
as
the
utter
treelessness
of
the
vast
canterbury
plains
occasionally
you
pass
a
few
palms
ordinarily
called
or
a
large
prickly
bush
which
goes
by
the
name
of
wild
irishman
but
for
miles
and
miles
you
see
nothing
but
flat
ground
or
slightly
undulating
downs
of
yellow
tussocks
the
tall
native
grass
it
has
the
colour
and
appearance
of
hay
but
serves
as
shelter
for
a
delicious
undergrowth
of
short
sweet
herbage
upon
which
the
sheep
live
and
horses
also
do
very
well
on
it
keeping
in
good
working
condition
quite
unlike
their
puffy
fat
state
on
english
pasture
we
drove
through
the
plantation
and
another
gate
and
drew
up
at
the
door
of
a
very
large
handsome
brick
house
with
projecting
gables
and
a
verandah
the
older
i
grow
the
more
convinced
i
am
that
contrast
is
everything
in
this
world
and
nothing
i
can
write
can
give
you
any
idea
of
the
delightful
change
from
the
bleak
country
we
had
been
slowly
travelling
through
in
pouring
rain
to
the
warmth
and
brightness
of
this
charming
house
there
were
blazing
fires
ready
to
welcome
us
and
i
feel
sure
you
will
sufficiently
appreciate
this
fact
when
i
tell
you
that
by
the
time
the
coal
reaches
this
it
costs
nine
pounds
per
ton
it
is
possible
to
get
australian
coal
at
about
half
the
price
but
it
is
not
nearly
as
good
we
were
so
tired
that
we
were
only
fit
for
the
lowest
phase
of
human
enjoyment
warmth
food
and
sleep
but
the
next
morning
was
bright
and
lovely
and
i
was
up
and
out
in
the
verandah
as
early
as
possible
i
found
myself
saying
constantly
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
how
i
wish
they
could
see
this
in
england
and
not
only
see
but
feel
it
for
the
very
breath
one
draws
on
such
a
morning
is
a
happiness
the
air
is
so
light
and
yet
balmy
it
seems
to
heal
the
lungs
as
you
inhale
it
the
verandah
is
covered
with
honeysuckles
and
other
creepers
and
the
gable
end
of
the
house
where
the
of
the
projects
is
one
mass
of
yellow
banksia
roses
in
full
blossom
a
stream
runs
through
the
grounds
fringed
with
weeping
willows
which
are
in
their
greatest
beauty
at
this
time
of
year
with
their
soft
feathery
foliage
of
the
tenderest
green
the
flower
beds
are
dotted
about
the
lawn
which
surrounds
the
house
and
slopes
away
from
it
and
they
are
brilliant
patches
of
colour
gay
with
verbenas
geraniums
and
petunias
here
and
there
clumps
of
tall
trees
rise
above
the
shrubs
and
as
a
background
there
is
a
thick
plantation
of
red
and
blue
gums
to
shelter
the
garden
from
the
strong
winds
then
in
front
the
country
stretches
away
in
undulating
downs
to
a
chain
of
high
hills
in
the
distance
every
now
and
then
there
is
a
deep
gap
in
these
through
which
you
see
magnificent
mountains
the
inside
of
the
house
is
as
charming
as
the
outside
and
the
perfection
of
comfort
but
i
am
perpetually
wondering
how
all
the
furniture
especially
the
fragile
part
of
it
got
here
when
i
remember
the
jolts
and
ruts
and
roughnesses
of
the
road
i
find
myself
looking
at
the
and
glass
shades
with
a
sort
of
respect
due
to
them
for
having
survived
so
many
dangers
the
first
two
or
three
days
we
enjoyed
ourselves
in
a
thoroughly
lazy
manner
the
garden
was
a
source
of
delight
and
there
were
all
the
animals
to
make
friends
with
mobs
of
horses
to
look
at
rabbits
poultry
and
pets
of
all
sorts
about
a
week
after
our
arrival
some
more
gentlemen
came
and
then
we
had
a
series
of
picnics
as
these
are
quite
unlike
your
highly
civilized
entertainments
which
go
by
the
same
name
i
must
describe
one
to
you
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
was
to
collect
all
the
provisions
and
pack
them
in
a
sort
of
and
then
we
started
in
an
american
waggon
drawn
by
a
pair
of
stout
cobs
we
drove
for
some
miles
till
we
came
to
the
edge
of
one
of
the
high
terraces
common
to
new
zealand
scenery
here
we
all
got
out
the
gentlemen
unharnessed
and
tethered
the
horses
so
that
they
could
feed
about
comfortably
and
then
we
scrambled
down
the
deep
slope
at
the
bottom
of
which
ran
a
wide
shallow
creek
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
the
basket
down
here
i
assure
you
we
ladies
were
only
permitted
to
load
ourselves
one
with
a
little
kettle
and
the
other
with
a
but
this
was
quite
enough
as
crossing
the
creek
by
a
series
of
jumps
from
one
wet
stone
to
another
is
not
easy
for
a
beginner
l
brought
a
large
dog
with
him
a
not
unlike
a
lurcher
in
appearance
to
hunt
the
wekas
i
had
heard
at
night
the
peculiar
cry
or
call
of
these
birds
but
had
not
seen
one
until
fly
put
up
several
one
after
another
and
soon
ran
them
down
at
first
i
thought
it
very
cruel
to
destroy
such
a
tame
and
apparently
harmless
creature
but
i
am
assured
that
they
are
most
mischievous
and
that
it
would
be
useless
to
turn
out
the
pheasants
and
partridges
which
l
has
brought
from
england
until
the
numbers
of
the
wekas
are
considerably
reduced
they
are
very
like
a
hen
pheasant
without
the
long
tail
feathers
and
until
you
examine
them
you
can
not
tell
they
have
no
wings
though
there
is
a
sort
of
small
pinion
among
the
feathers
with
a
claw
at
the
end
of
it
they
run
very
swiftly
availing
themselves
cleverly
of
the
least
bit
of
cover
but
when
you
hear
a
short
sharp
cry
it
is
a
sign
that
the
poor
weka
is
nearly
done
and
the
next
thing
you
see
is
fly
shaking
a
bundle
of
brown
feathers
vehemently
all
the
dogs
are
trained
to
hunt
these
birds
as
they
are
a
great
torment
sucking
eggs
and
killing
chickens
but
still
i
could
not
help
feeling
sorry
when
fly
having
disposed
of
the
mother
returned
to
the
out
of
which
he
had
started
her
and
killed
several
by
successive
taps
of
his
paw
i
have
wandered
away
from
my
account
of
the
picnic
in
the
most
unjustifiable
manner
the
gentlemen
were
toiling
up
the
hill
after
we
had
crossed
the
creek
carrying
the
big
basket
by
turns
between
them
it
was
really
hard
work
and
i
must
tell
you
in
confidence
that
i
believe
they
liked
it
at
least
i
can
answer
for
one
i
laughed
at
them
for
not
enjoying
their
task
and
assured
them
that
i
was
looking
forward
with
pleasure
to
washing
up
the
plates
and
dishes
after
our
luncheon
but
i
found
that
they
had
all
been
obliged
in
the
early
days
of
the
colony
to
work
at
domestic
drudgery
in
grim
and
grimy
earnest
so
it
had
lost
the
charm
of
novelty
which
it
still
possessed
for
me
as
soon
as
we
reached
a
pretty
sheltered
spot
up
the
hill
among
some
trees
and
ferns
and
by
the
side
of
the
creek
we
unpacked
the
basket
and
began
collecting
dry
wood
for
a
fire
we
soon
had
a
splendid
blaze
under
the
lee
of
a
fine
rock
and
there
we
boiled
our
kettle
and
our
potatoes
the
next
thing
was
to
find
a
deep
hole
in
the
creek
so
by
rocks
and
trees
that
the
water
would
be
icy
cold
in
this
we
put
the
champagne
to
cool
the
result
of
all
our
preparations
was
a
capital
luncheon
eaten
in
a
most
romantic
spot
with
a
lovely
view
before
us
and
the
creek
just
like
a
scotch
burn
hurrying
and
tumbling
down
the
to
join
the
broader
stream
in
the
valley
after
luncheon
the
gentlemen
considered
themselves
entitled
to
rest
lying
lazily
back
among
the
fern
and
smoking
whilst
we
ladies
sat
a
little
apart
and
chatted
i
was
busy
learning
to
knit
then
about
five
we
had
the
most
delicious
cup
of
tea
i
ever
tasted
and
we
repacked
the
basket
it
was
very
light
now
i
assure
you
and
made
our
way
back
to
the
top
of
the
terrace
put
the
horses
in
again
and
so
home
it
was
a
long
bright
summer
holiday
and
we
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
after
a
voyage
such
an
expedition
as
this
is
full
of
delight
every
tree
and
bird
is
a
source
of
pleasure
letter
v
a
pastoral
letter
heathstock
december
all
i
can
find
to
tell
you
this
month
is
that
i
have
seen
one
of
the
finest
and
best
in
the
country
in
full
work
anything
about
sheep
is
as
new
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
so
i
shall
begin
my
story
at
the
very
beginning
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
us
a
very
greedy
set
of
people
in
this
part
of
the
world
for
eating
seems
to
enter
so
largely
into
my
letters
but
the
fact
is
and
i
may
as
well
confess
it
at
once
i
am
in
a
chronic
state
of
hunger
it
is
the
fault
of
the
fine
air
and
the
outdoor
life
and
then
how
one
sleeps
at
night
i
do
believe
you
really
know
in
england
what
it
is
to
be
sleepy
as
we
feel
sleepy
here
and
it
is
delightful
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
with
the
sort
of
joyous
which
only
young
children
have
the
expedition
i
am
going
to
relate
may
fairly
be
said
to
have
begun
with
eating
for
although
we
started
for
our
twelve
miles
drive
over
the
downs
immediately
after
an
excellent
and
somewhat
late
breakfast
yet
by
the
time
we
reached
the
home
station
we
were
quite
ready
for
luncheon
all
the
work
connected
with
the
sheep
is
carried
on
here
the
manager
has
a
nice
house
and
the
men
huts
dip
are
near
each
other
it
is
the
busiest
season
of
the
year
and
no
time
could
be
spared
to
prepare
for
us
we
therefore
contented
ourselves
with
what
was
described
to
me
as
ordinary
station
fare
and
i
must
tell
you
what
they
gave
us
first
a
tureen
of
real
not
hot
water
and
chopped
parsley
but
thick
soup
with
plenty
of
barley
and
meat
in
it
this
had
much
the
same
effect
on
our
appetites
as
the
famous
treacle
and
brimstone
before
breakfast
in
nicholas
nickleby
so
that
we
were
only
able
to
manage
a
few
little
sheeps
tongues
slightly
pickled
and
very
nice
were
then
we
finished
with
a
devonshire
junket
with
clotted
cream
do
you
think
we
were
much
to
be
pitied
after
this
repast
we
were
obliged
to
rest
a
little
before
we
set
out
for
the
which
has
only
been
lately
finished
and
has
all
the
newest
improvements
at
first
i
am
free
to
confess
that
i
did
not
like
either
its
sounds
or
sights
the
other
two
ladies
turned
very
pale
but
i
was
determined
to
make
myself
bear
it
and
after
a
moment
or
two
i
found
it
quite
possible
to
proceed
with
l
round
the
floor
there
were
about
shearers
at
work
and
everything
seemed
to
be
very
systematically
and
well
arranged
each
shearer
has
a
close
to
him
out
of
which
he
pushes
his
sheep
as
soon
as
the
fleece
is
off
and
there
are
little
pens
outside
so
that
the
manager
can
notice
whether
the
poor
animal
has
been
too
much
cut
with
the
shears
or
badly
shorn
in
any
other
respect
and
can
tell
exactly
which
shearer
is
to
blame
before
this
plan
was
adopted
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
find
out
who
was
the
delinquent
for
no
one
would
acknowledge
to
the
least
snip
a
good
shearer
can
take
off
fleeces
in
a
day
but
the
average
is
about
to
each
man
they
get
one
pound
per
hundred
and
are
found
in
everything
having
as
much
tea
and
sugar
bread
and
mutton
as
they
can
consume
and
a
cook
entirely
to
themselves
they
work
at
least
fourteen
hours
out
of
the
and
with
such
a
large
flock
as
this
about
must
make
a
good
deal
we
next
inspected
the
wool
tables
to
which
two
boys
were
incessantly
bringing
armfuls
of
fleeces
these
were
laid
on
the
tables
before
the
who
opened
them
out
and
pronounced
in
a
moment
to
which
they
belonged
two
or
three
men
standing
behind
rolled
them
up
again
rapidly
and
put
them
on
a
sort
of
shelf
divided
into
compartments
which
were
each
labelled
so
that
the
quality
and
kind
of
wool
could
be
told
at
a
glance
there
was
a
constant
emptying
of
these
bins
into
trucks
to
be
carried
off
to
the
press
where
we
followed
to
see
the
bales
packed
the
fleeces
are
tumbled
in
and
a
heavy
forces
them
down
till
the
bale
which
is
kept
open
in
a
large
square
frame
is
as
full
as
it
can
hold
the
top
of
canvas
is
then
put
on
tightly
sewn
four
iron
pins
are
removed
and
the
sides
of
the
frame
fall
away
disclosing
a
most
symmetrical
bale
ready
to
be
hoisted
by
a
crane
into
the
loft
above
where
it
has
the
brand
of
the
sheep
painted
on
it
its
weight
and
to
what
class
the
wool
belongs
of
course
everything
has
to
be
done
with
great
speed
and
system
i
was
much
impressed
by
the
silence
in
the
shed
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
except
the
click
of
the
shears
and
the
decision
as
he
flings
the
fleece
behind
him
given
in
one
or
at
most
two
words
i
was
reminded
how
touchingly
true
is
that
phrase
like
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
all
the
noise
is
there
the
hubbub
and
dust
and
apparent
confusion
are
great
a
constant
succession
of
woolly
sheep
being
brought
up
to
fill
the
skillions
from
whence
the
shearers
take
them
as
they
want
them
and
the
ones
white
clean
and
being
turned
out
after
they
have
passed
through
a
narrow
passage
called
a
race
where
each
sheep
is
branded
and
has
its
mouth
examined
in
order
to
tell
its
age
which
is
marked
in
a
book
it
was
a
comfort
to
think
all
their
troubles
were
over
for
a
year
you
can
hear
nothing
but
barking
and
bleating
and
this
goes
on
from
early
morning
till
dark
we
peeped
in
at
the
men
huts
a
long
low
wooden
building
with
two
rows
of
bunks
berths
i
should
call
their
in
one
compartment
and
a
table
with
forms
round
it
in
the
other
and
piles
of
tin
plates
and
pannikins
all
about
the
kitchen
was
near
and
we
were
just
in
time
to
see
an
enormous
batch
of
bread
withdrawn
from
a
huge
brick
oven
the
other
commissariat
arrangements
were
on
the
same
scale
cold
tea
is
supplied
all
day
long
to
the
shearers
and
they
appear
to
consume
great
quantities
of
it
our
last
visit
was
to
the
dip
and
it
was
only
a
short
one
for
it
seemed
a
cruel
process
unfortunately
this
fine
station
is
in
technical
parlance
scabby
and
although
of
course
great
precautions
are
taken
still
some
sheep
had
an
ominous
large
s
on
them
these
poor
sufferers
are
dragged
down
a
plank
into
a
great
pit
filled
with
hot
water
tobacco
and
sulphur
and
soused
over
head
and
ears
two
or
three
times
this
torture
is
repeated
more
than
once
i
was
very
glad
to
get
away
from
the
dip
and
back
to
the
house
where
we
refreshed
ourselves
by
a
delicious
cup
of
tea
and
soon
after
started
for
a
nice
long
drive
home
in
the
cool
clear
evening
air
the
days
are
very
hot
but
never
oppressive
and
the
mornings
and
evenings
are
deliciously
fresh
and
invigorating
you
can
remain
out
late
without
the
least
danger
malaria
is
unknown
and
in
spite
of
the
heavy
rains
there
is
no
such
thing
as
damp
our
way
lay
through
very
pretty
country
a
series
of
terraces
with
a
range
of
mountains
before
us
with
beautiful
changing
and
softening
evening
tints
creeping
over
the
whole
i
am
sorry
to
say
we
leave
this
next
week
i
should
like
to
explore
a
great
deal
more
letter
vi
houses
and
servants
christchurch
january
i
am
beginning
to
get
tired
of
christchurch
already
but
the
truth
is
i
am
not
in
a
fair
position
to
judge
of
it
as
a
place
of
residence
for
living
temporarily
as
we
do
in
a
sort
of
i
miss
the
usual
duties
and
occupations
of
home
and
the
town
itself
has
no
place
of
public
amusement
except
a
little
theatre
to
which
it
is
much
too
hot
to
go
the
last
two
weeks
have
been
gay
ones
of
the
whole
year
the
races
have
been
going
on
for
three
days
and
there
have
been
a
few
balls
but
as
a
general
rule
the
society
may
be
said
to
be
extremely
stagnant
no
are
ever
given
i
imagine
on
account
of
the
smallness
of
the
houses
and
the
inefficiency
of
the
servants
but
every
now
and
then
there
is
an
assembly
ball
arranged
in
the
same
way
i
believe
as
at
in
england
only
of
course
on
a
much
smaller
scale
i
have
been
at
two
or
three
of
these
and
noticed
at
each
a
most
undue
preponderance
of
black
coats
nearly
all
the
ladies
were
married
there
were
very
few
young
girls
and
it
would
be
a
great
improvement
to
the
christchurch
parties
if
some
of
the
pretty
and
partnerless
groups
of
a
london
in
all
their
freshness
of
toilette
could
be
transferred
to
them
what
a
sensation
they
would
make
and
what
terrible
among
the
young
gentlemen
would
be
the
result
of
such
an
importation
there
were
the
same
knots
of
men
standing
together
as
at
a
london
party
but
i
must
say
that
except
so
far
as
their
tailor
is
concerned
i
think
we
have
the
advantage
of
you
for
the
gentlemen
lead
such
healthy
lives
that
they
all
look
more
or
less
bronzed
and
stalwart
in
splendid
condition
not
like
your
pale
dwellers
in
cities
and
then
they
come
to
a
ball
to
dance
arriving
early
so
as
to
secure
good
partners
and
their
great
ambition
appears
to
be
to
dance
every
dance
from
the
first
to
the
last
this
makes
it
hard
work
for
the
few
ladies
who
are
not
allowed
to
sit
down
for
a
moment
and
i
have
often
seen
a
young
and
pretty
partner
obliged
to
divide
her
dances
between
two
gentlemen
although
it
tells
only
against
myself
i
must
make
you
laugh
at
an
account
of
a
snub
i
received
at
one
of
these
balls
early
in
the
evening
i
had
danced
with
a
young
gentleman
whose
station
was
a
long
way
up
country
and
who
worked
so
hard
on
it
that
he
very
seldom
found
time
for
even
the
mild
dissipations
of
christchurch
he
was
and
gentlemanly
and
seemed
clever
and
sensible
a
little
perhaps
but
one
soon
gets
used
to
that
here
during
our
quadrille
he
confided
to
me
that
he
hardly
knew
any
ladies
in
the
room
and
that
his
prospects
of
getting
any
dancing
were
in
consequence
very
blank
i
did
all
i
could
to
find
partners
for
him
introducing
him
to
every
lady
whom
i
knew
but
it
was
in
vain
they
would
have
been
delighted
to
dance
with
him
but
their
cards
were
filled
at
the
end
of
the
evening
when
i
was
feeling
thoroughly
done
up
and
could
hardly
stand
up
for
fatigue
my
poor
friend
came
up
and
begged
for
another
dance
i
assured
him
i
could
scarcely
stand
but
when
he
said
in
a
voice
i
have
only
danced
once
this
evening
that
quadrille
with
you
my
heart
softened
and
i
thought
i
would
make
a
great
effort
and
try
to
get
through
one
more
set
of
lancers
my
partner
seemed
so
grateful
that
the
demon
of
vanity
or
coquetry
or
whatever
it
is
that
prompts
one
to
say
absurd
things
induced
me
to
fish
for
a
compliment
and
to
observe
it
was
not
worth
while
taking
all
the
trouble
of
riding
such
a
distance
to
dance
only
with
me
was
it
whereupon
my
poor
doleful
friend
answered
with
a
deep
sigh
and
an
accent
of
profound
conviction
no
indeed
it
was
i
leave
you
to
imagine
my
discomfiture
but
luckily
he
never
observed
it
and
i
felt
all
the
time
that
i
richly
deserved
what
i
got
for
asking
such
a
stupid
question
the
music
at
these
balls
is
very
bad
and
though
the
principal
room
in
which
they
are
given
at
the
town
hall
is
large
and
handsome
it
is
poorly
lighted
and
the
decorations
are
desolate
in
the
extreme
i
am
afraid
this
is
not
a
very
inviting
picture
of
what
is
almost
our
only
opportunity
of
meeting
together
but
it
is
tolerably
correct
visiting
appears
to
be
the
business
of
some
people
lives
but
the
acquaintance
does
not
seem
to
progress
beyond
incessant
afternoon
calls
we
are
never
asked
inside
a
house
nor
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
is
there
any
private
society
whatever
and
the
public
society
consists
as
i
have
said
of
a
ball
every
now
and
then
my
greatest
interest
and
occupation
consist
in
going
to
look
at
my
house
which
is
being
cut
out
in
christchurch
and
will
be
drayed
to
our
station
next
month
a
journey
of
fifty
miles
it
is
of
course
only
of
wood
and
seems
about
as
solid
as
a
but
i
am
assured
by
the
builder
that
it
will
be
a
most
superior
article
when
it
is
all
put
together
f
and
i
made
the
little
plan
of
it
ourselves
regulating
the
size
of
the
by
the
dimensions
of
the
carpet
we
brought
out
and
i
petitioned
for
a
little
which
is
to
be
added
so
on
my
last
visit
to
his
the
builder
said
with
an
air
of
great
dignity
would
you
wish
to
see
the
mum
the
doors
all
come
from
america
and
most
of
the
wood
used
in
building
is
the
kauri
pine
from
the
north
island
one
advantage
at
all
events
in
having
wooden
houses
is
the
extreme
rapidity
with
which
they
are
run
up
and
there
are
no
plastered
walls
to
need
drying
for
a
long
time
we
were
very
uncertain
where
and
what
we
should
build
on
our
station
but
only
six
weeks
after
we
made
up
our
minds
a
house
is
almost
ready
for
us
the
boards
are
sawn
into
the
requisite
lengths
by
machinery
and
all
the
carpentering
done
down
here
the
frame
will
only
require
to
be
fitted
together
when
it
reaches
its
destination
and
it
is
a
very
good
time
of
year
for
building
as
the
wool
drays
are
all
going
back
empty
and
we
can
get
them
to
take
the
loads
at
reduced
prices
but
even
with
this
help
it
is
enormously
expensive
to
move
a
small
house
fifty
miles
the
last
fifteen
over
bad
roads
it
is
for
the
poor
horses
all
the
way
christchurch
being
only
nine
feet
above
the
while
our
future
home
in
the
malvern
hills
is
twelve
hundred
you
know
we
brought
all
our
furniture
out
with
us
and
even
papers
for
the
rooms
just
because
we
happened
to
have
everything
but
i
should
not
recommend
any
one
to
do
so
for
the
expense
of
carriage
though
moderate
enough
by
sea
in
a
wool
ship
is
enormous
as
soon
as
it
reaches
lyttleton
and
goods
have
to
be
dragged
up
country
by
horses
or
bullocks
there
are
very
good
shops
where
you
can
buy
everything
and
besides
these
there
are
constant
sales
by
auction
where
i
am
told
furniture
fetches
a
price
sometimes
under
its
english
value
house
rent
about
christchurch
is
very
high
we
looked
at
some
small
houses
in
and
about
the
suburbs
of
the
town
when
we
were
undecided
about
our
plans
and
were
offered
the
most
inconvenient
little
dwellings
with
rooms
which
were
scarcely
bigger
than
cupboards
for
pounds
a
year
we
saw
nothing
at
a
lower
price
than
this
and
any
house
of
a
better
class
standing
in
a
nicely
arranged
shrubbery
is
at
least
pounds
per
annum
is
another
thing
which
seems
to
me
disproportionately
dear
as
horses
are
very
cheap
there
are
no
small
fares
being
the
lowest
legal
tender
to
a
cabman
and
i
soon
gave
up
returning
visits
when
i
found
that
to
make
a
call
in
a
hansom
three
or
four
miles
out
of
the
little
town
cost
one
pound
or
one
pound
ten
shillings
even
remaining
only
a
few
minutes
at
the
house
all
food
except
mutton
appears
to
be
as
nearly
as
possible
at
london
prices
but
yet
every
one
looks
perfectly
and
actual
want
is
unknown
wages
of
all
sorts
are
high
and
employment
a
certainty
the
look
and
bearing
of
the
immigrants
appear
to
alter
soon
after
they
reach
the
colony
some
people
object
to
the
independence
of
their
manner
but
i
do
not
on
the
contrary
i
like
to
see
the
upright
gait
the
healthy
look
the
decent
clothes
even
if
no
one
touches
his
hat
to
you
instead
of
the
depressed
appearance
and
too
often
cringing
servility
of
the
mass
of
our
english
population
scotchmen
do
particularly
well
out
here
frugal
and
thrifty
and
sober
it
is
easy
to
predict
the
future
of
a
man
of
this
type
in
a
new
country
naturally
the
whole
tone
of
thought
and
feeling
is
almost
exclusively
practical
even
in
a
morning
visit
there
is
no
i
find
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
useful
information
upon
domestic
subjects
which
i
so
much
need
for
it
is
sad
to
discover
after
all
my
experience
that
i
am
still
perfectly
ignorant
here
it
is
necessary
to
know
everything
should
be
done
it
is
not
sufficient
to
give
an
order
you
must
also
be
in
a
position
to
explain
how
it
is
to
be
carried
out
i
felt
quite
guilty
when
i
saw
the
picture
in
the
other
day
of
a
young
and
inexperienced
matron
requesting
her
cook
not
to
put
any
lumps
into
the
melted
butter
and
reflected
that
i
did
not
know
how
lumps
should
be
kept
out
so
as
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
number
among
my
new
friends
a
lady
who
is
as
clever
in
these
culinary
details
as
she
is
bright
and
charming
in
society
i
immediately
went
to
her
for
a
lesson
in
the
art
of
making
melted
butter
without
putting
lumps
into
it
the
great
complaint
the
subject
of
comparison
and
lamentation
among
ladies
is
the
utter
ignorance
and
inefficiency
of
their
female
servants
as
soon
as
a
ship
comes
in
it
is
besieged
with
people
who
want
servants
but
it
is
very
rare
to
get
one
who
knows
how
to
do
anything
as
it
ought
to
be
done
their
lack
of
all
knowledge
of
the
commonest
domestic
duties
is
most
surprising
and
makes
one
wonder
who
in
england
did
the
necessary
things
of
daily
cottage
life
for
them
for
they
appear
to
have
done
nothing
for
themselves
hitherto
as
for
a
woman
knowing
how
to
cook
that
seems
the
very
last
accomplishment
they
acquire
a
girl
will
come
to
you
as
a
housemaid
at
pounds
per
annum
and
you
will
find
that
she
literally
does
not
know
how
to
hold
her
broom
and
has
never
handled
a
duster
when
you
ask
a
nurse
her
qualifications
for
the
care
of
perhaps
two
or
three
young
children
you
may
find
on
close
that
she
can
recollect
having
once
or
twice
held
mother
baby
and
that
she
is
very
firm
in
her
determination
that
you
keep
baby
yourself
o
nights
mem
a
perfectly
inexperienced
girl
of
this
sort
will
ask
and
get
pounds
or
pounds
per
annum
a
cook
from
pounds
to
pounds
and
when
they
go
up
country
they
hint
plainly
they
shall
not
stay
long
with
you
and
ask
higher
wages
stipulating
with
great
exactness
how
they
are
to
be
conveyed
free
of
all
expense
to
and
from
their
place
then
on
the
other
hand
i
must
say
they
work
desperately
hard
and
very
cheerfully
i
am
amazed
how
few
servants
are
kept
even
in
the
large
and
better
class
of
houses
as
a
general
rule
they
appear
willing
enough
to
learn
and
i
hear
no
complaints
of
dishonesty
or
immorality
though
many
moans
are
made
of
the
rapidity
with
which
a
nice
tidy
young
woman
is
snapped
up
as
a
wife
but
that
is
a
complaint
no
one
can
sympathise
with
on
most
stations
a
married
couple
is
kept
the
man
either
to
act
as
shepherd
or
to
work
in
the
garden
and
look
after
the
cows
and
the
woman
is
supposed
to
attend
to
the
indoor
comforts
of
the
wretched
but
she
generally
requires
to
be
taught
how
to
bake
a
loaf
of
bread
and
boil
a
potato
as
well
as
how
to
cook
mutton
in
the
simplest
form
in
her
own
cottage
at
home
who
did
all
these
things
for
her
these
incapables
are
generally
perfectly
helpless
and
awkward
at
the
no
one
seems
to
expect
servants
to
know
their
business
and
it
is
very
fortunate
if
they
show
any
capability
of
learning
i
must
end
my
long
letter
by
telling
you
a
little
story
of
my
own
personal
experience
in
the
odd
ways
of
these
girls
the
housemaid
at
the
where
we
have
stayed
since
we
left
heathstock
is
a
fat
sonsy
girl
perfectly
ignorant
and
stupid
but
she
has
not
been
long
in
the
colony
and
seems
willing
to
learn
she
came
to
me
the
other
day
and
without
the
least
circumlocution
or
hesitation
asked
me
if
i
would
lend
her
my
as
a
pattern
to
give
the
tailor
adding
that
she
wanted
my
best
and
newest
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
for
amazement
i
naturally
asked
why
she
said
she
had
been
given
a
that
she
had
loaned
a
saddle
and
bought
a
hat
so
now
she
had
nothing
on
her
mind
except
the
habit
and
further
added
that
she
intended
to
leave
her
situation
the
day
before
the
races
and
that
it
was
her
fixed
intent
to
appear
on
horseback
each
day
and
all
day
long
at
these
said
races
i
inquired
if
she
knew
how
to
ride
no
she
had
never
mounted
any
animal
in
her
life
i
suggested
that
she
had
better
take
some
lessons
before
her
appearance
in
public
but
she
said
her
mistress
did
not
like
to
spare
her
to
practise
and
she
stuck
steadily
to
her
point
of
wanting
my
habit
as
a
pattern
i
could
not
lend
it
to
her
fortunately
for
it
had
been
sent
up
to
the
station
with
my
saddle
etc
so
had
she
been
killed
as
i
thought
not
at
all
unlikely
at
least
my
conscience
would
not
have
reproached
me
for
aiding
and
abetting
her
equestrian
freak
i
inquired
from
every
one
who
went
to
the
races
if
they
saw
or
heard
of
any
accident
to
a
woman
on
horseback
and
i
most
anxiously
watched
the
newspapers
to
see
if
they
contained
any
notice
of
the
sort
but
as
there
has
been
no
mention
of
any
catastrophe
i
suppose
she
has
escaped
safely
her
horse
must
have
been
quieter
and
better
broken
than
they
generally
are
f
says
that
probably
it
was
a
very
old
station
screw
i
trust
so
for
her
sake
letter
vii
a
young
the
town
and
its
neighbourhood
christchurch
march
i
must
begin
my
letter
this
mail
with
a
piece
of
domestic
news
and
tell
you
of
the
appearance
of
your
small
nephew
now
three
weeks
old
the
youth
seems
inclined
to
adapt
himself
to
circumstances
and
to
be
as
sturdy
and
independent
as
colonial
children
generally
are
all
my
new
friends
and
neighbours
proved
most
kind
and
friendly
and
were
full
of
good
offices
once
i
happened
to
say
that
i
did
not
like
the
food
as
it
was
cooked
at
the
and
the
next
day
and
for
many
days
after
all
sorts
of
dainties
were
sent
to
me
prepared
by
hands
which
were
as
skilful
on
the
piano
or
with
a
pencil
as
they
were
in
handling
a
saucepan
new
books
were
lent
to
me
and
i
was
never
allowed
to
be
without
a
beautiful
bouquet
one
young
lady
used
constantly
to
walk
in
to
town
some
two
or
three
miles
along
a
hot
and
dusty
road
laden
with
flowers
for
me
just
because
she
saw
how
thoroughly
i
enjoyed
her
roses
and
carnations
was
it
not
good
of
her
christchurch
has
relapsed
into
the
quietude
to
call
it
by
no
harsher
name
the
shearing
is
finished
all
over
the
country
and
the
squatters
as
owners
of
are
called
have
returned
to
their
stations
to
vegetate
or
work
as
their
tastes
and
circumstances
may
dictate
very
few
people
live
in
the
town
except
the
tradespeople
the
professional
men
prefer
little
villas
two
or
three
miles
off
these
houses
stand
in
grounds
of
their
own
and
form
a
very
pretty
approach
to
christchurch
extending
a
few
miles
on
all
sides
there
are
large
trees
bordering
most
of
the
streets
which
give
a
very
necessary
shade
in
summer
they
are
nearly
all
english
sorts
and
have
only
been
planted
within
a
few
years
poplars
willows
and
the
blue
gum
grow
quickest
are
least
affected
by
the
high
winds
and
are
therefore
the
most
popular
the
banks
of
the
pretty
little
river
avon
upon
which
christchurch
is
built
are
thickly
fringed
with
weeping
willows
interspersed
with
a
few
other
trees
and
with
clumps
of
tohi
which
is
exactly
like
the
pampas
grass
you
know
so
well
in
english
shrubberies
i
do
think
i
have
ever
told
you
that
it
has
been
found
necessary
here
to
legislate
against
it
was
introduced
a
few
years
since
and
has
spread
so
rapidly
as
to
become
a
perfect
nuisance
choking
every
ditch
in
the
neighbourhood
of
christchurch
blocking
up
causing
meadows
to
be
flooded
and
doing
all
kinds
of
mischief
towards
riccarton
about
four
miles
out
of
town
the
avon
shows
like
a
slender
stream
a
few
inches
wide
moving
sluggishly
between
thick
beds
of
which
at
this
time
of
year
are
a
mass
of
white
blossom
it
looks
so
perfectly
solid
that
whenever
i
am
at
ilam
an
insane
desire
to
step
on
it
comes
over
me
much
to
f
alarm
who
says
he
is
afraid
to
let
me
out
of
his
sight
lest
i
should
attempt
to
do
so
i
have
only
seen
one
native
bush
or
forest
yet
and
that
is
at
riccarton
this
patch
of
tall
gaunt
pines
serves
as
a
landmark
for
miles
riccarton
is
one
of
the
oldest
farms
in
the
colony
and
i
am
told
it
possesses
a
beautiful
garden
i
can
only
see
the
of
a
house
peeping
out
from
among
the
trees
as
i
pass
this
bush
is
most
carefully
preserved
but
i
believe
that
every
high
wind
injures
it
christchurch
is
very
prettily
situated
for
although
it
stands
on
a
perfectly
flat
plain
towards
the
sea
there
are
the
port
hills
and
the
town
itself
is
picturesque
owing
to
the
quantities
of
trees
and
the
irregular
form
of
the
wooden
houses
and
as
a
background
we
have
the
most
magnificent
chain
of
mountains
the
of
the
island
running
from
north
to
south
the
highest
peaks
nearly
always
covered
with
snow
even
after
such
a
hot
summer
as
this
has
been
the
climate
is
now
delicious
answering
in
time
of
year
to
your
september
but
we
have
far
more
enjoyable
weather
than
your
autumns
can
boast
of
if
the
atmosphere
were
no
older
than
the
date
of
the
settlement
of
the
colony
it
could
not
feel
more
it
is
so
light
and
bright
and
exhilarating
the
one
drawback
and
the
only
one
is
the
wind
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
blows
very
often
from
this
point
however
i
am
assured
that
i
have
not
yet
seen
either
a
howling
nor
its
exact
antithesis
a
sutherly
buster
we
have
lately
been
deprived
of
the
amusement
of
going
to
see
our
house
during
the
process
of
cutting
it
out
as
it
has
passed
that
stage
and
has
been
packed
on
drays
and
sent
to
the
station
with
two
or
three
men
to
put
it
up
it
was
preceded
by
two
of
small
stone
piles
which
are
first
let
into
the
ground
six
or
eight
feet
apart
the
foundation
joists
rest
on
these
so
as
just
to
keep
the
flooring
from
touching
the
earth
i
did
not
like
this
plan
which
is
the
usual
one
at
all
as
it
seemed
to
me
so
insecure
for
the
house
to
rest
only
on
these
stones
i
told
the
builder
that
i
feared
a
strong
and
i
hear
they
are
particularly
strong
in
the
malvern
hills
would
blow
the
whole
affair
away
he
did
not
scout
the
idea
as
much
as
i
could
have
wished
but
held
out
hopes
to
me
that
the
roof
would
kep
it
down
i
shall
never
dare
to
trust
the
baby
out
of
my
sight
lest
he
should
be
blown
away
and
i
have
a
plan
for
securing
his
cradle
by
putting
large
heavy
stones
in
it
somewhere
out
of
his
way
so
that
he
need
not
be
hurt
by
them
some
of
the
houses
are
built
of
cob
especially
those
erected
in
the
very
early
days
when
sawn
timber
was
rare
and
valuable
this
material
is
simply
wet
clay
with
chopped
tussocks
stamped
in
it
makes
very
thick
walls
and
they
possess
the
great
advantage
of
being
cool
in
summer
and
warm
in
winter
whilst
the
house
is
new
nothing
can
be
nicer
but
in
a
few
years
the
hot
winds
dry
up
the
clay
so
much
that
it
becomes
quite
pulverized
and
a
lady
who
lives
in
one
of
these
houses
told
me
that
during
a
high
wind
she
had
often
seen
the
dust
from
the
walls
blowing
in
clouds
about
the
rooms
despite
of
the
canvas
and
paper
and
with
all
the
windows
carefully
closed
next
week
f
is
going
up
to
the
station
to
unpack
and
arrange
a
little
and
baby
and
i
are
going
to
be
taken
care
of
at
ilam
the
most
charming
place
i
have
yet
seen
i
am
looking
forward
to
my
visit
there
with
great
pleasure
letter
viii
pleasant
days
at
ilam
ilam
april
we
leave
this
for
the
station
in
the
most
extraordinary
conveyance
you
ever
saw
imagine
a
flat
tray
with
two
low
seats
in
it
perched
on
four
very
high
wheels
quite
innocent
of
any
step
or
means
of
clambering
in
and
out
and
drawn
by
two
stout
mares
one
of
which
has
a
little
foal
by
her
side
the
advantage
of
this
vehicle
is
that
it
is
very
light
and
holds
a
good
deal
of
luggage
we
hope
to
accomplish
the
distance
fifty
miles
in
a
day
easily
although
this
is
not
my
first
visit
to
ilam
i
do
think
i
have
ever
described
it
to
you
the
house
is
of
wood
two
storeys
high
and
came
out
from
england
it
is
built
on
a
brick
foundation
which
is
quite
unusual
here
inside
it
is
exactly
like
a
most
charming
english
house
and
when
i
first
stood
in
the
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
i
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
all
the
newest
books
papers
and
periodicals
covered
the
tables
the
newest
music
lay
on
the
piano
whilst
a
profusion
of
english
greenhouse
flowers
in
minton
loveliest
vases
added
to
the
illusion
the
avon
winds
through
the
grounds
which
are
very
pretty
and
are
laid
out
in
the
english
fashion
but
in
spite
of
the
lawn
with
its
and
sticks
and
the
beds
of
flowers
in
all
their
late
summer
beauty
there
is
a
certain
absence
of
the
stiffness
and
trimness
of
english
which
shows
that
you
have
escaped
from
the
region
of
conventionalities
there
are
thick
clumps
of
plantations
which
have
grown
luxuriantly
and
look
as
if
they
had
always
been
there
a
curve
of
the
opposite
bank
is
a
dense
mass
of
native
flax
bushes
with
their
tall
spikes
of
red
blossom
filling
the
air
with
a
scent
of
honey
and
attracting
all
the
bees
in
the
neighbourhood
palms
are
dotted
here
and
there
and
give
a
foreign
and
tropical
appearance
to
the
whole
there
is
a
large
kitchen
garden
and
orchard
with
none
of
the
restrictions
of
high
walls
and
locked
gates
which
fence
your
english
peaches
and
apricots
the
following
is
our
receipt
for
killing
time
at
ilam
after
breakfast
take
the
last
or
put
on
a
shady
hat
and
sit
or
saunter
by
the
under
the
trees
gathering
any
very
tempting
peach
or
apricot
or
plum
or
pear
until
luncheon
same
thing
until
five
tea
then
cross
the
river
by
a
rustic
bridge
ascend
some
turf
steps
to
a
large
meadow
sheltered
from
the
winds
by
a
thick
belt
of
firs
blue
gums
and
poplars
and
play
croquet
on
turf
as
level
as
a
until
dinner
at
these
games
the
cockatoo
always
assists
making
himself
very
busy
waddling
after
his
mistress
all
over
the
field
and
climbing
up
her
mallet
whenever
he
has
an
opportunity
lindley
so
called
from
his
taste
for
pulling
flowers
to
pieces
apparently
for
botanical
purposes
is
the
tamest
and
most
affectionate
of
birds
and
i
do
not
believe
he
ever
bit
any
one
in
his
life
he
will
allow
himself
to
be
pulled
about
turned
upside
down
scratched
under
his
wings
all
with
the
greatest
indifference
or
rather
with
the
most
positive
enjoyment
one
evening
i
could
not
play
croquet
for
laughing
at
his
antics
he
took
a
sudden
dislike
to
a
little
rough
terrier
and
hunted
him
fairly
off
the
ground
at
last
chasing
him
all
about
barking
at
him
and
digging
his
beak
into
the
poor
dog
paw
but
the
doctor
best
performance
is
when
he
imitates
a
hawk
he
reserves
this
fine
piece
of
acting
until
his
mistress
is
feeding
her
poultry
then
when
all
the
hens
and
chickens
turkeys
and
pigeons
are
in
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
their
breakfast
or
supper
the
peculiar
shrill
cry
of
a
hawk
is
heard
overhead
and
the
doctor
is
seen
circling
in
the
air
uttering
a
scream
occasionally
the
fowls
never
find
out
that
it
is
a
hoax
but
run
to
shelter
cackling
in
the
greatest
alarm
hens
clucking
loudly
for
their
chicks
turkeys
crouching
under
the
bushes
the
pigeons
taking
refuge
in
their
house
as
soon
as
the
ground
is
quite
clear
cocky
changes
his
wild
note
for
peals
of
laughter
from
a
high
tree
and
finally
alighting
on
the
top
of
a
filled
with
trembling
chickens
remarks
in
a
suffocated
voice
you
be
the
death
of
me
i
must
reverse
the
proverb
about
the
ridiculous
and
the
sublime
and
finish
my
letter
by
telling
you
of
ilam
chief
outdoor
charm
from
all
parts
of
the
garden
and
grounds
i
can
feast
my
eyes
on
the
glorious
chain
of
mountains
which
i
have
before
told
you
of
and
my
bedroom
window
has
a
perfect
panoramic
view
of
them
i
watch
them
under
all
their
changes
of
tint
and
find
each
new
phase
the
most
beautiful
in
the
very
early
morning
i
have
often
stood
shivering
at
my
window
to
see
the
noble
outline
gradually
assuming
shape
and
finally
standing
out
sharp
and
clear
against
a
dazzling
sky
then
as
the
sun
rises
the
softest
and
golden
tints
touch
the
highest
peaks
the
shadows
deepening
by
the
contrast
before
a
the
colours
over
these
mountains

quite

no
one
but
turner
could
venture
upon
such
a
mixture
of
pale
with
deep
turquoise
blue
purple
with
crimson
and
orange
one
morning
an
appearance
in
the
clouds
over
the
furthest
ranges
was
pointed
out
to
me
as
the
sure
forerunner
of
a
violent
gale
from
the
and
the
prognostic
was
fulfilled
it
was
formed
of
clouds
of
the
deepest
and
richest
colours
within
its
curve
lay
a
bare
expanse
of
a
wonderful
green
tint
crossed
by
the
snowy
of
the
southern
alps
a
few
hours
afterwards
the
mountains
were
quite
hidden
by
mist
and
a
furious
gale
of
hot
wind
was
shaking
the
house
as
if
it
must
carry
it
off
into
the
sky
it
blew
so
continuously
that
the
trees
and
shrubs
never
seemed
to
rise
for
a
moment
against
it
these
hot
winds
affect
infants
and
children
a
good
deal
and
my
baby
is
not
at
all
well
however
his
doctor
thinks
the
change
to
the
station
will
set
him
all
right
again
so
we
are
hurrying
off
much
sooner
than
our
kind
friends
here
wish
and
long
before
the
little
house
in
the
hills
can
possibly
be
made
comfortable
though
f
is
working
very
hard
to
get
things
settled

may
i
do
not
like
to
allow
the
first
panama
steamer
to
go
without
a
line
from
me
this
is
the
only
letter
i
shall
attempt
and
it
will
be
but
a
short
and
sad
one
for
we
are
still
in
the
first
bitterness
of
grief
for
the
loss
of
our
dear
little
baby
after
i
last
wrote
to
you
he
became
very
ill
but
we
hoped
that
his
malady
was
only
caused
by
the
unhealthiness
of
christchurch
during
the
autumn
and
that
he
would
soon
revive
and
get
on
well
in
this
pure
beautiful
mountain
air
we
consequently
hurried
here
as
soon
as
ever
we
could
get
into
the
house
and
whilst
the
carpenters
were
still
in
it
indeed
there
was
only
one
bedroom
ready
for
us
when
i
arrived
the
poor
little
man
rallied
at
first
amazingly
the
weather
was
exquisitely
bright
and
sunny
and
yet
bracing
baby
was
to
be
kept
in
the
open
air
as
much
as
possible
so
f
and
i
spent
our
days
out
on
the
downs
near
the
house
carrying
our
little
treasure
by
turns
but
all
our
care
was
fruitless
he
got
another
and
more
violent
attack
about
a
fortnight
ago
and
after
a
few
hours
of
suffering
he
was
taken
to
the
land
where
pain
is
unknown
during
the
last
twelve
hours
of
his
life
as
i
sat
before
the
fire
with
him
on
my
lap
poor
f
kneeling
in
a
perfect
agony
of
grief
by
my
side
my
greatest
comfort
was
in
looking
at
that
exquisite
photograph
from
kehren
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
which
hangs
over
my
bedroom
mantelpiece
and
thinking
that
our
sweet
little
lamb
would
soon
be
folded
in
those
divine
arms
it
is
not
a
common
picture
and
the
expression
of
the
saviour
face
is
most
beautiful
full
of
such
immense
feminine
compassion
and
tenderness
that
it
makes
me
feel
more
vividly
in
all
our
sorrows
he
is
afflicted
in
such
a
grief
as
this
i
find
the
conviction
of
the
reality
and
depth
of
the
divine
sympathy
is
my
only
true
comfort
the
tenderest
human
love
falls
short
of
the
feeling
that
without
any
words
to
express
our
sorrow
god
knows
all
about
it
that
he
would
not
willingly
afflict
or
grieve
us
and
that
therefore
the
anguish
which
wrings
our
hearts
is
absolutely
necessary
in
some
mysterious
way
for
our
highest
good
i
fear
i
have
often
thought
lightly
of
others
trouble
in
the
loss
of
so
young
a
child
but
now
i
know
what
it
is
does
it
not
seem
strange
and
sad
that
this
little
house
in
a
distant
lonely
spot
no
sooner
becomes
a
home
than
it
is
baptized
as
it
were
with
tears
no
doubt
there
are
bright
and
happy
days
in
store
for
us
yet
but
these
first
ones
here
have
been
sadly
darkened
by
this
shadow
of
death
inanimate
things
have
such
a
terrible
power
to
wound
one
though
everything
which
would
remind
me
of
baby
has
been
carefully
removed
and
hidden
away
by
f
orders
still
now
and
then
i
come
across
some
trifle
belonging
to
him
and
as
miss
ingelow
says
my
old
sorrow
wakes
and
cries
our
loss
is
one
too
common
out
here
i
am
told
infants
born
in
christchurch
during
the
autumn
very
often
die
owing
to
the
flatness
of
the
site
of
the
town
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
a
proper
system
of
drainage
and
the
arrangements
seem
very
bad
if
you
are
to
judge
from
the
evil
smells
which
are
abroad
in
the
evening
children
who
are
born
on
a
station
or
taken
there
as
soon
as
possible
almost
invariably
thrive
but
babies
are
very
difficult
to
rear
in
the
towns
if
they
get
over
the
first
year
they
do
well
and
i
can
not
really
call
to
mind
a
single
sickly
or
even
child
among
the
swarms
which
one
sees
everywhere
i
can
not
say
that
i
think
colonial
children
prepossessing
in
either
manners
or
appearance
in
spite
of
their
ruddy
cheeks
and
sturdy
limbs
even
quite
little
things
are
pert
and
independent
and
give
me
the
idea
of
being
very
much
spoiled
when
you
reflect
on
the
utter
absence
of
any
one
who
can
really
be
called
a
nurse
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
the
mothers
are
thoroughly
domestic
and
devoted
to
their
home
duties
far
more
so
than
the
generality
of
the
same
class
at
home
an
english
lady
with
even
an
extremely
moderate
income
would
look
upon
her
colonial
sister
as
very
indeed
the
children
can
not
be
entrusted
entirely
to
the
care
of
an
ignorant
girl
and
the
poor
mother
has
them
with
her
all
day
long
if
she
goes
out
to
pay
visits
the
only
recognized
social
duty
here
she
has
to
take
the
elder
children
with
her
but
this
early
introduction
into
society
does
not
appear
to
polish
the
young
visitors
manners
in
the
least
there
is
not
much
rest
at
night
for
the
with
the
inevitable
baby
and
it
is
of
course
very
difficult
for
her
to
be
correcting
small
delinquents
all
day
long
so
they
grow
up
with
what
manners
nature
gives
them
there
seems
to
me
however
to
be
a
greater
amount
of
real
domestic
happiness
out
here
than
at
home
perhaps
the
want
of
places
of
public
amusement
may
have
something
to
do
with
this
desirable
state
of
affairs
but
the
homes
seem
to
be
thoroughly
happy
ones
a
married
man
is
an
object
of
envy
to
his
less
fortunate
brethren
and
he
appears
anxious
to
show
that
he
appreciates
his
good
fortune
as
for
scandal
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
it
is
unknown
gossip
there
is
in
plenty
but
it
generally
refers
to
each
other
pecuniary
arrangements
or
trifling
peculiarities
and
is
all
harmless
enough
i
really
believe
that
the
life
most
people
lead
here
is
as
simple
and
innocent
as
can
well
be
imagined
each
family
is
occupied
in
providing
for
its
own
little
daily
wants
and
cares
which
supplies
the
mind
and
body
with
healthy
and
legitimate
employment
and
yet
as
my
experience
tells
me
they
have
plenty
of
leisure
to
do
a
kind
turn
for
a
neighbour
this
is
the
bright
side
of
colonial
life
and
there
is
more
to
be
said
in
its
praise
but
the
counterbalancing
drawback
is
that
the
people
seem
gradually
to
lose
the
sense
of
larger
and
wider
interests
they
have
little
time
to
keep
pace
with
the
general
questions
of
the
day
and
anything
like
sympathy
or
intellectual
appreciation
is
very
rare
i
meet
accomplished
people
but
seldom
ones
there
is
also
too
much
talk
about
money
where
the
treasure
is
there
will
the
heart
be
also
and
the
incessant
financial
discussions
are
wearisome
at
least
to
me
letter
x
our
station
home
broomielaw
july
we
are
now
in
and
a
more
delicious
season
can
not
well
be
imagined
the
early
mornings
and
evenings
and
the
nights
are
very
cold
but
the
hours
from
till
are
exquisitely
bright
and
quite
warm
we
are
glad
of
a
fire
at
breakfast
which
is
tolerably
early
but
we
let
it
out
and
never
think
of
relighting
it
until
dark
above
all
it
is
calm
i
congratulate
myself
daily
on
the
stillness
of
the
atmosphere
but
f
laughs
and
says
wait
until
the
spring
i
bask
all
day
in
the
verandah
carrying
my
books
and
work
there
soon
after
breakfast
as
soon
as
the
sun
goes
down
however
it
becomes
very
cold
in
an
english
house
you
would
hardly
feel
it
but
with
only
one
plank
an
inch
thick
a
and
canvas
and
paper
between
you
and
a
hard
frost
a
good
fire
is
wanted
we
burn
coal
found
twelve
miles
from
this
it
is
not
very
good
being
only
what
is
called
lignite
i
do
know
if
that
conveys
to
you
a
distinct
impression
of
what
it
really
is
i
should
say
it
was
a
better
sort
of
turf
it
smoulders
just
in
the
same
way
and
if
not
disturbed
will
remain
many
hours
alight
it
requires
a
log
of
dry
wood
with
it
to
make
a
really
good
blaze
fuel
is
most
difficult
to
get
here
and
very
expensive
as
we
have
no
available
bush
on
the
run
so
we
have
first
to
take
out
a
licence
for
cutting
wood
in
the
government
bush
then
to
employ
men
to
cut
it
and
hire
a
drayman
who
possesses
a
team
of
bullocks
and
a
dray
of
his
own
to
fetch
it
to
us
he
can
only
take
two
journeys
a
day
as
he
has
four
miles
to
travel
each
way
so
that
by
the
time
the
wood
is
stacked
it
costs
us
at
least
thirty
shillings
a
cord
and
then
there
is
the
labour
of
sawing
and
cutting
it
up
the
coal
costs
us
one
pound
a
ton
at
the
mouth
of
the
pit
and
the
carriage
exactly
doubles
its
price
besides
which
it
is
impossible
to
get
more
than
a
small
quantity
at
a
time
on
account
of
the
effect
of
the
atmosphere
on
it
exposure
to
the
air
causes
it
to
crumble
into
dust
and
although
we
keep
our
supply
in
a
little
shed
for
the
purpose
it
is
wasted
to
the
extent
of
at
least
a
quarter
of
each
load
we
are
unusually
unfortunate
in
the
matter
of
firing
most
stations
have
a
bush
near
to
the
homestead
or
greater
facilities
for
draying
than
we
possess
you
tell
me
to
describe
my
little
house
to
you
so
i
must
try
to
make
you
see
it
only
prefacing
my
attempt
by
warning
you
not
to
be
disgusted
or
disappointed
at
any
shortcomings
the
house
has
not
been
built
in
a
pretty
situation
as
many
other
things
had
to
be
considered
before
a
picturesque
site
first
it
was
necessary
to
build
on
a
flat
as
the
valleys
here
are
called
not
too
far
off
the
main
track
on
account
of
having
to
make
the
road
to
it
ourselves
the
next
thing
to
be
thought
of
was
shelter
from
the
wind
then
the
soil
must
be
fit
for
a
garden
and
a
good
creek
or
brook
which
would
not
go
dry
in
the
summer
close
at
hand
at
present
everything
out
of
doors
is
so
unfinished
that
the
place
looks
rather
desolate
and
it
will
be
some
years
before
our
plantations
can
attain
a
respectable
size
even
allowing
for
the
rapid
growth
in
this
climate
the
first
step
is
to
obtain
shelter
from
our
enemy
the
and
for
this
purpose
we
have
planted
quantities
of
broom
in
all
directions
even
the
large
beds
for
vegetables
in
the
garden
have
a
hedge
of
cape
broom
on
the
exposed
side
fortunately
the
broom
grows
very
quickly
in
spite
of
the
wind
and
attains
to
a
luxuriant
beauty
rarely
seen
in
england
we
have
put
in
many
other
trees
such
as
oaks
maples
but
not
one
is
higher
than
this
table
except
a
few
poplars
the
ground
immediately
outside
the
house
has
been
dug
up
and
is
awaiting
the
spring
to
be
sown
with
english
grass
we
have
no
attempt
at
a
yet
but
have
devoted
our
energies
to
the
vegetable
one
putting
in
fruit
trees
preparing
strawberry
and
asparagus
beds
and
other
useful
things
out
of
doors
matters
would
not
even
be
as
far
advanced
towards
a
garden
and
plantation
as
they
are
if
we
had
commenced
operations
ourselves
but
the
ground
has
been
worked
since
last
year
i
am
glad
we
have
chosen
to
build
our
house
here
instead
of
at
the
homestead
two
miles
off
for
i
like
to
be
removed
from
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
all
the
work
of
the
station
especially
from
that
of
the
gallows
a
high
wooden
frame
from
which
the
carcases
of
the
butchered
sheep
dangle
under
the
present
arrangement
the
shepherd
brings
us
over
our
mutton
as
we
want
it
inside
the
house
everything
is
comfortable
and
pretty
and
above
all
things
looks
thoroughly
out
of
the
verandah
you
pass
through
a
little
hall
hung
with
whips
and
sticks
spurs
and
hats
and
with
a
bookcase
full
of
novels
at
one
end
of
it
into
a
large
enough
for
us
with
more
books
in
every
available
corner
the
prints
you
know
so
well
on
the
walls
and
a
trophy
of
indian
swords
and
over
the
fireplace
this
leads
into
the
a
bright
cheery
little
room
more
books
and
pictures
and
a
in
the
in
that
tall
white
vase
of
minton
which
you
helped
me
to
choose
is
the
most
beautiful
bouquet
made
entirely
of
ferns
it
is
a
constant
object
for
my
walks
up
the
gullies
exploring
little
patches
of
bush
to
search
for
the
ferns
which
grow
abundantly
under
their
shelter
by
the
creek
i
have
a
small
but
comfortable
bedroom
and
there
is
a
little
for
f
and
the
tiniest
spare
room
you
ever
saw
it
really
is
not
bigger
than
the
cabin
of
a
ship
i
think
the
kitchen
is
the
chief
glory
of
the
house
boasting
a
leamington
range
a
luxury
quite
unknown
in
these
parts
where
all
the
cooking
is
done
on
an
american
stove
a
very
good
thing
in
its
way
but
requiring
to
be
constantly
attended
to
there
is
a
storeroom
in
which
f
has
just
finished
putting
me
up
some
cupboards
and
a
servants
room
it
is
not
a
palace
is
it
but
it
is
quite
large
enough
to
hold
a
great
deal
of
happiness
outside
the
premises
are
still
more
diminutive
a
little
stands
near
the
kitchen
door
and
further
up
the
enclosure
is
a
stable
and
a
small
room
next
it
for
saddles
and
a
and
and
a
now
you
know
everything
about
my
surroundings
but
there
is
always
a
in
everything
i
have
one
great
grievance
and
i
hope
you
will
appreciate
its
magnitude
it
was
impossible
for
f
to
come
up
here
when
the
house
was
first
commenced
and
the
wretch
of
a
builder
deliberately
put
the
fireplaces
in
the
corner
right
up
against
the
partition
wall
of
course
utterly
destroying
the
comfort
as
well
as
the
symmetry
of
the
rooms
i
am
convinced
some
economy
of
bricks
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
arrangement
especially
as
the
house
was
built
by
contract
but
the
builder
pretends
to
be
surprised
that
i
do
admire
it
and
says
why
it
so
oncommon
mum
i
assure
you
when
i
first
saw
the
ridiculous
appearance
of
the
in
the
corner
i
should
liked
to
have
screamed
out
at
the
builder
like
the
queen
in
alice
in
wonderland
cut
off
his
head
when
we
were
packing
up
the
things
to
come
here
our
friends
expressed
their
astonishment
at
our
taking
so
many
of
the
little
elegancies
of
life
such
as
ornaments
pictures
etc
now
it
is
a
great
mistake
not
to
bring
such
things
at
all
events
a
few
of
them
for
they
are
not
to
be
bought
here
and
they
give
the
new
home
a
certain
likeness
to
the
old
one
which
is
always
delightful
i
do
not
advise
people
to
make
large
purchases
of
elegancies
for
a
colonial
life
but
a
few
pretty
little
trifles
will
greatly
improve
the
look
of
even
a
new
zealand
you
have
asked
me
also
about
our
wardrobes
gentlemen
wear
just
what
they
would
on
a
scotch
or
english
farm
in
summer
they
require
perhaps
a
lighter
hat
and
long
rides
are
always
taken
in
boots
and
breeches
a
lady
wears
exactly
what
would
be
suitable
in
the
country
in
england
except
that
i
should
advise
her
to
eschew
muslin
the
country
outside
the
home
paddock
is
too
rough
for
thin
material
she
also
wants
thick
boots
if
she
is
a
good
walker
and
i
find
nails
or
little
screws
in
the
soles
a
great
help
for
a
hat
is
my
only
difficulty
you
really
want
a
shady
hat
for
a
protection
against
the
sun
but
there
are
very
few
days
in
the
year
on
which
you
can
ride
in
anything
but
a
close
small
hat
with
hardly
any
brim
at
all
and
even
this
must
have
capabilities
of
being
firmly
fastened
on
the
head
my
nice
leghorn
hangs
idly
in
the
hall
there
is
hardly
a
morning
still
enough
to
induce
me
to
put
it
on
even
to
go
and
feed
my
chickens
or
potter
about
the
garden
this
being
winter
i
live
in
a
short
linsey
dress
which
is
just
right
as
to
warmth
and
not
heavy
it
is
a
mistake
to
bring
too
much
a
year
supply
will
be
quite
enough
fresh
material
can
easily
be
procured
in
christchurch
or
any
of
the
large
towns
or
sent
out
by
friends
i
find
my
the
greatest
possible
comfort
and
as
time
passes
on
and
my
clothes
need
remodelling
it
will
be
still
more
use
ful
hitherto
i
have
used
it
chiefly
for
my
friends
benefit
whilst
i
was
in
town
i
constantly
had
little
frocks
brought
to
me
to
tuck
and
here
i
employ
it
in
making
quilted
cloth
hats
for
my
gentlemen
neighbours

broomielaw
september
i
am
writing
to
you
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
of
very
hard
work
for
i
have
just
gone
through
my
first
experience
in
changing
servants
those
i
brought
up
with
me
four
months
ago
were
nice
tidy
girls
and
as
a
natural
consequence
of
these
attractive
qualities
they
have
both
left
me
to
be
married
i
sent
them
down
to
christchurch
in
the
dray
and
made
arrangements
for
two
more
servants
to
return
in
the
same
conveyance
at
the
end
of
a
week
in
the
meantime
we
had
to
do
everything
for
ourselves
and
on
the
whole
we
found
this
picnic
life
great
fun
the
household
consists
besides
f
and
me
of
a
cadet
as
they
are
called
he
is
a
clergyman
son
learning
under
our
auspices
and
a
boy
who
milks
the
cows
and
does
odd
jobs
out
of
doors
we
were
all
equally
ignorant
of
practical
cookery
so
the
chief
responsibility
rested
on
my
shoulders
and
cost
me
some
very
anxious
moments
i
assure
you
for
a
is
after
all
but
a
broken
reed
to
lean
on
in
a
real
emergency
it
starts
by
assuming
that
its
unhappy
student
possesses
a
knowledge
of
at
least
the
rudiments
of
the
art
whereas
it
ought
not
to
disdain
to
tell
you
whether
the
water
in
which
potatoes
are
to
be
boiled
should
be
hot
or
cold
i
must
confess
that
some
of
my
earliest
efforts
were
both
curious
and
nasty
but
e
ate
my
numerous
failures
with
the
greatest
the
only
thing
at
which
he
made
a
wry
face
was
some
soup
into
which
a
large
lump
of
had
mysteriously
conveyed
itself
and
i
also
had
to
undergo
a
good
deal
of
chaff
about
my
first
omelette
which
was
of
the
size
and
consistency
of
a
pudding
next
to
these
failures
i
think
the
bread
was
my
greatest
misfortune
it
went
wrong
from
the
first
one
night
i
had
prepared
the
tin
dish
full
of
flour
made
a
hole
in
the
midst
of
the
soft
white
heap
and
was
about
to
pour
in
a
cupful
of
yeast
to
be
mixed
with
warm
water
you
see
i
know
all
about
it
in
theory
when
a
sudden
panic
seized
me
and
i
was
afraid
to
draw
the
cork
of
the
large
champagne
bottle
full
of
yeast
which
appeared
to
be
very
much
up
in
this
dilemma
i
went
for
f
you
must
know
that
he
possesses
such
extraordinary
and
revolutionary
theories
on
the
subject
of
cooking
that
i
am
obliged
to
banish
him
from
the
kitchen
altogether
but
on
this
occasion
i
thought
i
should
be
glad
of
his
assistance
he
came
with
the
greatest
alacrity
assured
me
he
knew
all
about
it
seized
the
big
bottle
shook
it
violently
and
twitched
out
the
cork
there
was
a
report
like
a
and
all
my
beautiful
yeast
flew
up
to
the
ceiling
of
the
kitchen
descending
in
a
shower
on
my
head
and
f
turned
the
bottle
upside
down
over
the
flour
emptying
the
dregs
of
the
hops
and
potatoes
into
my
unfortunate
bread
however
i
did
not
despair
but
mixed
it
up
according
to
the
directions
given
and
placed
it
on
the
stove
but
as
it
turned
out
in
too
warm
a
situation
for
when
i
went
early
the
next
morning
to
look
at
it
i
found
a
very
dry
and
crusty
mass
still
nothing
daunted
i
persevered
in
the
attempt
added
more
flour
and
water
and
finally
made
it
up
into
loaves
which
i
deposited
in
the
oven
that
bread
baked
i
tried
it
with
a
knife
in
the
orthodox
manner
always
to
find
that
it
was
raw
inside
the
crust
gradually
became
several
inches
thick
but
the
inside
remained
damp
and
turned
quite
black
at
last
i
baked
it
until
midnight
and
then
i
gave
it
up
and
retired
to
bed
in
deep
disgust
i
had
no
more
yeast
and
could
not
try
again
so
we
lived
on
biscuits
and
potatoes
till
the
dray
returned
at
the
end
of
the
week
bringing
however
only
one
servant
owing
to
some
confusion
in
the
drayman
arrangements
the
cook
had
been
left
behind
and
meary
the
new
arrival
professed
her
willingness
to
supply
her
place
but
on
trial
being
made
of
her
abilities
she
proved
to
be
quite
as
inexperienced
as
i
was
and
to
each
dish
i
proposed
she
should
attempt
the
unvarying
answer
was
the
missis
did
all
that
where
i
come
from
during
the
first
few
days
after
her
arrival
her
chief
employment
was
examining
the
various
about
the
in
her
own
department
she
was
greatly
taken
with
the
little
cottage
mangle
she
mangled
her
own
apron
about
twenty
times
a
day
and
after
each
attempt
i
found
her
contemplating
it
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
saying
to
herself
thin
it
as
smooth
as
smooth
how
iver
does
it
do
it
a
few
days
later
the
cook
arrived
she
is
not
all
i
could
wish
being
also
irish
and
having
the
most
extraordinary
notions
of
the
use
or
rather
the
abuse
of
the
various
kitchen
implements
for
instance
she
will
poke
the
fire
with
the
toasting
fork
and
disregards
my
gentle
hints
about
the
poker
but
at
all
events
she
can
both
roast
mutton
and
bake
bread
meary
has
been
induced
to
wash
her
face
and
braid
up
her
beautiful
hair
and
now
shines
forth
as
a
very
pretty
girl
she
is
as
clever
and
quick
as
possible
and
will
in
time
be
a
capital
housemaid
she
has
taken
it
into
her
head
that
she
would
like
to
be
a
as
she
calls
it
and
works
desperately
hard
in
the
prosecution
of
her
new
fancy
i
have
never
told
you
of
the
sunday
services
we
established
here
from
the
first
week
of
our
arrival
there
is
no
church
nearer
than
those
in
christchurch
nor
i
may
mention
parenthetically
is
there
a
doctor
within
the
same
distance
as
soon
as
our
chairs
and
tables
were
in
their
proper
places
we
invited
our
shepherds
and
those
neighbours
immediately
around
us
to
attend
service
on
sunday
afternoon
at
three
f
officiates
as
clergyman
duties
resemble
those
of
a
beadle
as
i
have
to
arrange
the
congregation
in
their
places
see
that
they
have
etc
whenever
we
go
out
for
a
ride
we
turn
our
heads
up
some
beautiful
valley
or
deep
gorge
of
a
river
in
search
of
the
huts
of
our
neighbours
shepherds
that
we
may
tell
the
men
of
these
services
and
invite
them
to
attend
as
yet
we
have
met
with
no
refusals
but
it
will
give
you
an
idea
of
the
scantiness
of
our
population
when
i
tell
you
that
after
all
our
exertions
the
outsiders
only
amount
to
fourteen
and
of
these
at
least
half
are
gentlemen
from
neighbouring
stations
with
this
number
in
addition
to
our
own
small
group
we
consider
that
we
form
quite
a
respectable
gathering
the
congregation
all
arrive
on
horseback
each
attended
by
at
least
two
big
colley
dogs
the
horses
are
turned
into
the
paddock
the
saddles
deposited
in
the
back
verandah
and
the
dogs
lie
quietly
down
by
their
respective
masters
equipments
until
they
are
ready
to
start
homewards
there
is
something
very
wild
and
touching
in
these
sunday
services
if
the
weather
is
quite
clear
and
warm
they
are
held
in
the
verandah
but
unless
it
is
a
very
sunny
afternoon
it
is
too
early
in
the
year
yet
for
this
the
shepherds
are
a
very
fine
class
of
men
as
a
rule
and
i
find
them
most
intelligent
they
lead
solitary
lives
and
are
fond
of
reading
and
as
i
am
anxious
to
substitute
a
better
sort
of
literature
in
their
huts
than
the
tattered
yellow
volumes
which
generally
form
their
scanty
library
i
lend
them
books
from
my
own
small
collection
but
as
i
foresee
that
this
supply
will
soon
be
exhausted
we
have
started
a
book
club
and
sent
to
london
for
twenty
pounds
worth
of
books
as
a
first
instalment
we
shall
get
them
from
a
large
library
so
i
hope
to
receive
a
good
boxful
the
club
consists
of
members
now
and
will
probably
amount
to
which
is
wonderful
for
this
district
at
the
close
of
a
year
from
the
first
distribution
of
the
books
they
are
to
be
divided
into
lots
as
near
as
possible
in
value
to
a
pound
each
the
parcels
to
be
numbered
and
corresponding
figures
written
on
slips
of
paper
which
are
to
be
shaken
up
in
a
hat
and
drawn
at
random
each
member
claiming
the
parcel
of
which
the
number
answers
to
that
on
his
ticket
this
is
the
fairest
way
i
can
think
of
for
the
distribution
and
every
one
seems
satisfied
with
the
scheme
the
most
popular
books
are
those
of
travel
or
adventure
unless
a
novel
is
really
very
good
indeed
they
do
not
care
about
it
the
last
little
item
of
home
news
with
which
i
must
close
this
budget
is
that
f
has
been
away
for
a
few
days
on
a
skating
excursion
a
rather
distant
neighbour
of
ours
called
on
his
way
up
to
the
station
far
back
among
the
hills
and
gave
such
a
glowing
account
of
the
condition
of
the
ice
in
that
part
of
the
country
that
f
who
is
very
fond
of
the
amusement
was
persuaded
to
accompany
him
our
friend
is
the
son
of
the
bishop
and
owns
a
large
station
about
miles
from
this
at
the
back
of
his
run
the
hills
rise
to
a
great
height
and
nestled
among
them
lie
a
chain
of
lakes
after
the
largest
of
which
lake
coleridge
h
station
is
named
on
one
of
the
smaller
lakes
called
by
the
classical
name
of
ida
the
ice
attains
to
a
great
thickness
for
it
is
surrounded
by
such
lofty
hills
that
during
the
winter
months
the
sun
hardly
touches
it
and
it
is
commonly
reported
that
a
could
cross
it
in
perfect
safety
f
was
away
nearly
a
week
and
appears
to
have
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
though
it
will
seem
to
you
more
of
hard
work
than
amusement
for
he
and
h
and
some
other
gentlemen
who
were
staying
there
used
to
mount
directly
after
breakfast
with
their
skates
tied
to
their
and
ride
twelve
miles
to
lake
ida
skate
all
through
the
short
winter
day
lunching
at
the
solitary
hut
of
a
close
by
the
lake
and
when
it
grew
dusk
riding
home
again
the
gentlemen
in
this
country
are
in
such
good
training
through
constant
exercise
that
they
appear
able
to
stand
any
amount
of
fatigue
without
minding
it
letter
xii
my
first
expedition
broomielaw
october
this
ought
to
be
early
spring
but
the
weather
is
really
colder
and
more
disagreeable
than
any
which
winter
brought
us
and
proverbially
fickle
as
spring
sunshine
and
showers
are
in
england
ours
is
a
far
more
capricious
and
trying
season
twice
during
this
month
have
i
been
a
victim
to
these
sudden
changes
of
climate
on
the
first
occasion
it
was
most
fortunate
that
we
had
reached
the
shelter
of
a
friendly
and
hospitable
roof
for
it
was
three
days
before
we
could
the
which
lay
between
us
and
home
one
beautiful
spring
morning
f
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
ride
across
the
hills
and
pay
my
first
visit
to
some
kind
and
old
friends
of
his
who
were
among
the
earliest
arrivals
in
the
province
and
who
have
made
a
lovely
home
for
themselves
at
the
foot
of
a
great
bush
on
the
other
side
of
our
range
i
was
delighted
at
the
idea
for
i
have
had
very
little
opportunity
of
going
about
since
we
came
here
owing
to
the
short
winter
days
and
the
amount
of
occupation
at
home
consequent
on
a
new
establishment
directly
after
breakfast
the
horses
were
caught
and
saddled
and
we
started
in
high
spirits
as
we
rode
up
the
long
sunny
valley
stretching
away
for
miles
at
the
back
of
the
house
f
pointed
out
to
me
with
all
a
pride
the
hundreds
of
pretty
little
lambs
skipping
about
the
low
after
we
passed
our
own
boundary
fence
we
came
upon
a
very
bad
track
this
is
the
name
by
which
all
roads
are
called
and
they
do
not
deserve
a
better
but
it
was
the
only
path
to
our
destination
the
air
was
mild
and
balmy
and
the
sun
shone
brightly
as
we
slowly
picked
our
way
across
bogs
and
creeks
and
up
and
down
steep
slippery
but
just
as
we
reached
the
lowest
saddle
of
the
range
and
prepared
to
descend
a
cold
wind
met
us
in
an
instant
the
sunshine
was
overclouded
and
f
pointing
to
a
grey
bank
of
cloud
moving
quickly
towards
us
said
there
is
a
tremendous
coming
up
we
had
better
push
on
for
shelter
or
you
be
drowned
but
alas
at
each
step
the
road
grew
worse
and
worse
where
it
was
level
the
ground
was
literally
honeycombed
with
deep
holes
half
full
of
water
and
at
last
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
horse
had
to
descend
a
flight
of
stone
steps
each
step
being
extremely
slippery
and
some
way
below
the
other
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
horrible
staircase
there
was
a
wide
jump
to
be
taken
the
spring
being
off
the
lowest
step
and
the
jump
upwards
alighting
on
a
steep
bank
up
which
the
horses
scrambled
like
cats
getting
wet
through
appeared
to
me
a
very
minor
evil
compared
to
the
dangers
of
such
a
road
but
f
urged
me
forward
with
assurances
that
the
horse
knew
the
path
perfectly
well
and
could
carry
me
at
a
gallop
quite
safely
but
it
was
impossible
to
infuse
sufficient
courage
into
my
drooping
heart
to
induce
me
to
go
faster
than
a
walk
all
this
time
the
storm
drew
rapidly
nearer
the
wind
blew
in
icy
cold
gusts
the
hail
came
down
in
large
stones
pelting
our
faces
till
they
tingled
again
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
we
rode
up
to
the
hospitable
porch
door
of
rockwood
i
was
immediately
lifted
off
my
saddle
by
kind
and
strong
arms
and
carried
with
frozen
limbs
and
streaming
habit
into
the
kitchen
for
i
was
as
unfit
for
the
as
my
own
a
blazing
wood
fire
was
hastily
lighted
in
one
of
the
and
thither
the
good
hostess
conveyed
me
i
emerged
from
that
apartment
the
most
extraordinary
figure
you
ever
saw
imagine
me
arrayed
in
a
short
and
very
wide
crinoline
over
which
was
a
linsey
petticoat
an
old
for
a
jacket
huge
carpet
slippers
on
my
feet
and
my
dripping
hair
hanging
loose
over
my
shoulders
i
assure
you
i
looked
like
the
portraits
in
books
of
travel
of
the
tahitian
women
when
they
first
assumed
clothes
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
i
had
to
remain
in
this
costume
for
three
whole
days
to
return
was
impossible
the
storm
from
the
raged
all
that
evening
when
we
opened
our
eyes
next
morning
snow
was
lying
some
inches
deep
and
still
falling
fast
there
was
no
cessation
for
hours
and
then
we
had
to
give
it
time
to
thaw
a
little
so
that
it
was
sunday
morning
before
we
started
on
our
homeward
ride
in
the
meantime
nothing
could
afford
a
greater
contrast
to
the
wild
weather
out
of
doors
than
the
snug
brightness
within
blazing
logs
of
pine
and
black
birch
made
every
room
warm
and
cheery
all
day
we
chatted
and
amused
ourselves
in
different
ways
i
learned
to
make
a
capital
pudding
and
acquainted
myself
with
the
mysteries
of
junket
in
the
evenings
we
had
whist
for
an
hour
and
then
either
round
games
or
songs
the
young
men
of
the
house
have
nice
voices
and
a
great
feeling
for
music
and
some
of
the
trios
and
glees
went
very
well
indeed
the
only
thing
which
spoilt
my
enjoyment
was
the
constantly
recurring
remembrance
of
that
terrible
road
f
tried
to
comfort
me
by
assurances
that
the
snow
would
have
filled
up
the
worst
places
so
much
that
i
should
not
see
them
but
strange
to
say
i
failed
to
derive
any
consolation
from
that
idea
however
we
accomplished
the
journey
back
safely
but
with
many
slips
and
slides
as
soon
as
we
came
on
our
own
run
f
began
to
look
out
for
dead
lambs
but
fortunately
there
were
not
many
for
him
to
mourn
over
they
must
have
taken
shelter
under
the
low
hills
to
leeward
of
the
storm
the
second
ride
was
much
longer
and
if
possible
a
more
disagreeable
one
it
began
just
in
the
same
way
we
were
again
decoyed
out
by
sunshine
and
soft
air
for
a
ride
round
the
run
starting
about
ten
the
scenery
was
beautiful
and
we
enjoyed
ourselves
immensely
the
track
lay
along
our
own
boundary
fence
most
of
the
way
and
we
had
ridden
about
ten
miles
when
we
stopped
at
one
of
our
shepherds
huts
technically
called
an
out
station
and
accepted
his
offer
of
luncheon
he
gave
us
capital
tea
with
an
egg
beaten
up
in
it
as
a
substitute
for
milk
cold
mutton
bread
and
a
cake
the
reason
of
these
unwonted
luxuries
was
that
he
kept
fowls
and
i
was
very
jealous
at
seeing
two
broods
of
chickens
out
whilst
mine
are
still
in
the
shell
this
man
is
quite
an
artist
and
the
walls
of
his
but
were
covered
with
bold
sketches
chiefly
reminiscences
of
the
in
england
or
his
own
adventures
getting
out
wild
cattle
on
the
black
hills
in
the
north
of
the
province
he
leads
an
existence
his
dogs
being
his
only
companions
his
duties
consist
in
riding
daily
a
boundary
down
the
gorge
of
the
river
which
he
has
to
cross
and
many
times
and
he
has
to
supply
the
home
station
and
our
house
with
mutton
killing
four
or
five
sheep
a
week
he
is
employed
out
of
doors
all
day
but
has
plenty
of
time
in
the
evenings
for
reading
i
found
him
and
intelligent
and
he
expresses
himself
exceedingly
well

rested
here
an
hour

as
we
went
outside
and
prepared
to
mount

said
i
really
believe
there
is
coming
up
and
so
there
was
we
could
not
go
fast
for
we
were
riding
over
a
dry
composed
entirely
of
loose
large
stones
every
few
hundred
yards
we
had
to
cross
the
river
selwyn
which
was
rising
rapidly
as
the
storm
had
been
raging
in
the
mountains
long
before
it
reached
us
on
each
side
were
high
steep
hills
and
in
some
places
the
river
filled
up
the
gorge
entirely
and
we
had
to
ride
in
the
water
up
to
our
all
this
time
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
sheets
but
the
wind
grew
colder
and
colder
at
last
the
rain
turned
into
snow
which
speedily
changed
us
and
our
horses
into
white

eight

miles
of
this

we
only
able
to
trot
the
last

those
over
very
swampy

in

a
severe
cold
would
probably
have
been
the
least
evil
of
this
escapade
but
here
no
such

a
good

the
houses
are
so
little
real
protection
from
the
weather
that
you
are
forced
to
live
as
it
were
in
the
open

whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
this
hardens
the
constitution
so
much
that
it

are
apt

bachelor
a
gale
on
shore
broomielaw
november
we
have
lately
made
a
much
longer
excursion
than
those
i
told
you
of
last
month
and
this
time
have
been
fortunate
in
meeting
with
fine
weather
above
all
our
expedition
has
been
over
perfectly
level
ground
and
on
a
good
track
which
has
greatly
increased
its
charms
in
my
eyes
a
fortnight
ago
early
summer
set
fairly
in
and
some
bachelor
neighbours
took
advantage
of
the
change
to
ride
over
to
see
us
and
arrange
a
plan
for
the
following
week
it
all
fitted
in
nicely
for
f
was
obliged
to
go
to
christchurch
at
that
time
and
the
first
idea
of
the
expedition
originated
in
my
saying
how
dull
i
was
at
the
station
when
he
was
away
i
can
get
on
very
well
all
day
with
my
various
employments
feeding
the
chickens
taking
the
big
dogs
out
for
a
walk
and
so
on
but
after
the
house
is
quiet
and
silent
for
the
night
and
the
servants
have
gone
to
bed
a
horrible
lonely
eerie
feeling
comes
over
me
the
solitude
is
so
dreary
and
the
silence
so
intense
only
broken
occasionally
by
the
wild
melancholy
cry
of
the
weka
however
i
am
very
rarely
tried
in
this
way
and
when
i
am
it
ca
be
helped
if
that
is
any
consolation
i
forget
whether
i
told
you
that
we
left
all
evening
things
and
other
toilette
necessaries
which
would
not
be
wanted
up
country
behind
us
in
christchurch
so
as
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
sending
any
luggage
backwards
or
forwards
it
is
necessary
to
mention
this
to
account
for
the
very
light
marching
order
in
which
we
travelled
it
was
a
lovely
summer
morning
on
which
we
left
home
meaning
to
be
away
nearly
a
week
from
monday
till
saturday
we
were
well
mounted
and
all
our
luggage
consisted
of
my
little
fastened
to
the
pommel
of
my
saddle
containing
our
brushes
and
combs
and
what
is
termed
a
swag
in
front
of
f
saddle
that
is
a
long
narrow
bundle
in
this
instance
enclosed
in
a
neat
waterproof
case
and
fastened
with
two
straps
to
the
d
which
are
steel
loops
let
in
in
four
places
to
all
colonial
saddles
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
blankets
etc
they
derive
their
name
apparently
from
their
resemblance
to
the
letter
in
this
parcel
our
most
indispensable
garments
were
tightly
packed
we
cantered
gaily
along
on
the
way
to
christchurch
the
horses
appearing
to
enjoy
the
delicious
air
and
soft
springy
turf
as
much
as
we
did
there
was
a
river
and
creeks
to
be
crossed
but
they
are
all
quite
low
at
this
time
of
year
as
we
stood
in
one
of
them
to
let
the
horses
drink
and
cool
their
legs
i
saw
a
huge
eel
hidden
under
the
shadow
of
a
high
overhanging
bank
waiting
till
the
evening
to
come
out
and
feed
upon
the
myriads
of
flies
and
little
white
moths
that
skim
over
the
surface
of
the
water
it
is
considered
a
great
advantage
to
our
station
that
there
is
only
the
river
selwyn
of
which
the
maori
name
is
the
between
us
and
town
not
only
for
our
own
convenience
but
because
it
is
easy
to
take
sheep
across
it
and
it
offers
no
difficulties
to
the
wool
drays
this
river
has
a
very
good
reputation
and
is
very
rarely
dangerous
to
cross
whereas
the
rakaia
and
the
rangitata
towards
the
south
and
the
waimakiriri
towards
the
north
of
christchurch
are
most
difficult
and
always
liable
to
sudden
freshes
the
general
mode
of
crossing
the
larger
rivers
is
by
a
boat
with
the
horse
swimming
behind
but
accidents
constantly
occur
from
the
foolhardiness
of
people
attempting
to
ford
them
alone
on
horseback
they
are
lost
in
quicksands
or
carried
down
by
the
current
before
they
can
even
realize
that
they
are
in
danger
the
common
saying
in
new
zealand
is
that
people
only
die
from
drowning
and
drunkenness
i
am
afraid
the
former
is
generally
the
result
of
the
latter
from
the
first
our
road
lay
with
our
backs
to
the
hills
but
as
we
cantered
along
the
plains
i
was
often
obliged
to
turn
round
and
admire
their
grand
outlines
the
highest
ranges
were
still
and
made
a
magnificent
background
against
the
summer
sky
an
easy
twelve
ride
brought
us
to
a
charming
little
station
called
by
the
pretty
native
name
of
waireka
here
lived
our
three
bachelor
hosts
and
a
nicer
or
more
comfortable
home
in
a
distant
land
could
not
be
desired
the
house
has
been
built
for
some
years
consequently
the
plantations
about
it
and
the
garden
have
grown
up
well
and
the
willows
and
poplars
shelter
it
perfectly
besides
giving
it
such
a
snug
home
look
it
stands
on
a
vast
plain
without
even
an
undulation
of
the
ground
near
it
but
the
mountains
form
a
grand
panoramic
view
there
is
a
large
wide
verandah
round
two
sides
of
the
house
with
french
windows
opening
into
it
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
impatient
to
see
my
own
creepers
in
such
luxuriant
beauty
as
these
roses
and
honeysuckles
were
it
was
half
amusing
and
half
pathetic
to
notice
the
preparations
which
had
been
made
to
receive
a
lady
guest
and
the
great
anxiety
of
my
hosts
to
ensure
my
being
quite
as
comfortable
as
i
am
at
home
much
had
been
said
beforehand
about
the
necessity
of
making
up
my
mind
to
rough
it
in
bachelor
quarters
so
i
was
surprised
to
find
all
sorts
of
luxuries
in
my
room
especially
a
dainty
little
draped
with
white
cloths
a
big
wooden
was
its
foundation
its
ornaments
were
all
sorts
of
nondescript
treasures
placed
in
boxes
at
the
last
moment
of
leaving
the
english
hall
or
rectory
by
careful
loving
hands
of
mothers
and
sisters
and
lying
unused
for
years
until
now
there
was
a
little
china
tray
which
had
been
slipped
into
some
corner
by
a
anxious
to
send
some
possession
of
her
very
own
out
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
there
was
a
vase
with
flowers
a
of
very
gay
silks
probably
the
parting
gift
of
an
old
nurse
and
a
curious
essence
bottle
with
the
surrounding
country
had
been
ransacked
to
procure
a
piece
of
scented
soap
the
only
thing
to
remind
me
that
i
was
not
in
an
english
cottage
was
the
opossum
rug
with
which
the
neat
little
bed
was
covered
the
looked
the
picture
of
cosy
comfort
with
its
sofa
with
another
opossum
rug
thrown
over
it
and
the
open
fireplace
filled
with
ferns
and
tufts
of
the
white
feathery
tohi
grass
in
front
of
the
green
background
we
enjoyed
our
luncheon
or
rather
early
dinner
immensely
after
our
ride
and
in
the
afternoon
went
out
to
see
the
nice
large
garden
such
a
contrast
to
our
wretched
little
beginnings
and
finally
strolled
on
to
the
inevitable
where
the
gentlemen
had
an
animated
sheep
talk
i
rather
enjoy
these
discussions
though
they
are
prefaced
by
an
apology
for
talking
shop
but
it
amuses
me
and
i
like
to
see
the
samples
of
wool
which
are
generally
handed
about
in
the
heat
of
a
great
argument
the
long
white
locks
are
so
glistening
and
soft
and
crinkly
my
tea
was
duly
remembered
and
then
as
there
was
nothing
more
to
see
out
of
doors
within
a
short
distance
i
proposed
that
i
should
make
a
cake
the
necessary
ingredients
were
quickly
collected
i
had
relays
of
volunteers
to
beat
up
the
eggs
and
though
i
suffered
great
anxiety
until
it
was
cut
at
supper
it
turned
out
satisfactorily
the
worst
of
my
cookery
is
that
while
i
always
follow
the
same
directions
most
carefully
there
is
great
uncertainty
and
variety
about
the
result
in
the
evening
we
played
round
games
but
we
all
went
early
to
bed
as
we
had
to
be
up
betimes
and
in
the
saddle
by
seven
to
catch
the
train
at
rolleston
twenty
miles
off
we
had
a
beautiful
still
morning
for
our
ride
and
reached
the
station
a
shed
standing
out
on
the
plain
in
time
to
see
our
horses
safely
paddocked
before
the
train
started
for
christchurch
the
distance
by
rail
was
only
fifteen
miles
so
we
were
not
long
about
it
and
we
walked
to
the
hotel
from
the
in
the
town
a
bath
and
breakfast
were
both
very
enjoyable
and
then
f
went
out
to
transact
his
business
and
i
employed
myself
in
unpacking
and
a
for
a
party
to
which
we
were
engaged
that
evening
there
was
also
another
ball
the
following
night
the
second
was
a
very
late
one
and
we
had
scarcely
an
hour
sleep
before
we
were
obliged
to
get
up
and
start
by
the
train
back
to
rolleston
where
we
remounted
our
horses
and
rode
to
dear
little
waireka
in
time
for
breakfast
by
the
evening
i
was
sufficiently
rested
to
make
another
cake
which
also
happily
turned
out
well
we
intended
to
return
home
the
next
day
friday
but
a
terrific
came
on
in
the
night
and
it
was
impossible
to
stir
out
of
the
house
it
was
the
severest
gale
since
our
arrival
and
it
is
hardly
possible
to
give
you
a
correct
idea
of
the
force
and
fury
of
the
wind
not
a
glimpse
of
the
mountains
was
to
be
seen
a
haze
of
dust
as
thick
as
any
fog
shut
everything
out
the
sheep
had
all
taken
refuge
under
the
high
banks
of
the
creeks
it
is
curious
that
sheep
always
feed
head
to
wind
in
a
gale
whereas
they
will
drift
for
miles
before
a
the
trees
bent
almost
flat
before
the
hot
breath
of
this
hurricane
and
although
the
house
was
built
of
cob
and
its
walls
were
very
thick
and
solid
the
creaking
and
swaying
of
the
shingled
roof
kept
me
in
perpetual
alarm
the
verandah
was
a
great
protection
and
yet
the
small
of
which
the
was
made
were
dashed
against
the
windows
like
hailstones
by
each
gust
we
amused
ourselves
indoors
by
the
study
and
composition
of
acrostics
and
so
got
through
an
imprisonment
of
two
days
without
a
moment
cessation
of
the
wind
but
towards
sunset
on
saturday
there
were
signs
of
a
lull
and
about
midnight
the
gale
dropped
and
we
heard
the
grateful
refreshing
sound
of
soft
and
continuous
rain
and
when
we
came
out
to
breakfast
on
sunday
morning
everything
looked
revived
again
it
is
a
most
fortunate
meteorological
fact
that
these
very
high
winds
are
generally
succeeded
by
heavy
rain
everything
is
so
parched
and
shrivelled
up
by
them
that
i
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
the
vegetation
otherwise
we
held
a
council
to
determine
what
had
better
be
done
about
returning
home
and
finally
decided
to
risk
a
wet
ride
sooner
than
disappoint
the
little
congregation
for
should
it
prove
a
fine
afternoon
those
who
lived
near
would
certainly
come
so
we
mounted
after
breakfast
i
was
wrapped
in
one
of
the
gentlemen
macintoshes
and
found
the
ride
far
from
disagreeable
as
we
neared
our
own
station
we
began
to
look
out
for
signs
of
disaster
and
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
saw
some
of
the
vanes
from
the
chimneys
on
the
track
a
little
nearer
home
across
the
path
lay
a
large
zinc
then
another
and
when
we
came
close
enough
to
see
the
house
distinctly
it
looked
very
much
dwarfed
without
its
chimneys
there
had
been
a
large
pile
of
empty
boxes
at
the
back
of
the
stable
these
were
all
blown
away
in
the
gale
one
huge
was
sailing
tranquilly
about
on
the
pond
and
planks
and
fragments
of
zinc
were
strewn
over
the
paddock
the
moment
we
reached
the
house
u
the
of
whom
i
have
told
you
came
out
with
a
melancholy
face
to
tell
me
that
a
large
wooden
cage
full
of
the
canaries
which
i
had
brought
from
england
with
me
had
been
blown
out
of
the
verandah
though
it
was
on
the
most
sheltered
side
of
the
house
it
really
seemed
incredible
at
first
but
the
cage
was
lying
in
ruins
in
the
middle
of
the
paddock
and
all
my
birds
except
one
had
disappeared
it
happened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
u
described
very
amusingly
that
when
he
was
awakened
by
the
noise
which
the
cage
made
against
a
wire
fence
which
it
just
topped
in
passing
he
sprang
out
of
his
bed
in
the
attic
and
clambered
out
of
the
window
expecting
to
find
the
very
heavy
sort
of
in
its
place
but
it
was
over
the
hills
and
far
away
so
he
had
a
drop
of
about
twelve
feet
to
the
ground
which
thoroughly
aroused
him
he
went
into
the
verandah
to
see
if
the
cage
was
safe
and
was
nearly
knocked
down
by
a
big
tin
bath
ordinarily
kept
there
which
was
just
starting
across
country
as
soon
as
he
missed
the
cage
he
very
pluckily
went
after
it
being
able
to
keep
sight
of
it
by
the
fitful
gleams
of
and
he
was
just
in
time
to
rescue
the
poor
little
surviving
canary
we
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
recital
of
all
the
mischief
which
had
been
done
but
still
it
is
very
tiresome
and
the
garden
looks
if
possible
more
wretched
than
ever
there
is
no
shelter
for
it
yet
and
my
poor
are
blown
nearly
out
of
the
ground
it
rained
hard
all
the
evening
so
our
congregation
was
confined
to
the
home
party
letter
xiv
a
christmas
picnic
and
other
doings
broomielaw
december
it
is
too
late
to
wish
you
a
merry
christmas
and
a
happy
new
year
in
this
letter
in
order
to
allow
them
to
reach
you
in
time
i
should
have
sent
my
good
wishes
in
october
letter
i
must
remember
to
do
so
next
year
i
am
writing
on
the
last
days
of
the
month
so
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
of
our
own
christmas
doings
though
first
i
must
describe
the
festivities
attending
a
coming
of
age
in
the
bush
to
which
we
were
invited
about
the
middle
of
this
month
how
strange
christmas
picnics
and
balls
will
appear
in
your
eyes
before
which
still
dangle
probably
the
dear
old
traditional
holly
and
ivy
i
am
obliged
to
preface
all
my
descriptions
with
an
account
of
a
ride
if
i
am
to
begin
according
to
your
repeated
injunctions
at
the
very
beginning
for
a
ride
is
quite
certain
to
be
both
the
beginning
and
end
of
each
excursion
simply
because
we
have
no
other
means
of
going
about
except
on
our
feet
the
ride
upon
this
occasion
was
to
rockwood
where
the
birthday
party
was
to
assemble
but
the
road
had
not
now
so
many
terrors
for
me
in
consequence
of
the
fine
dry
weather
most
of
the
bad
places
were
safer
and
firmer
and
the
numerous
creeks
were
only
shallow
sparkling
streamlets
over
which
a
child
could
jump
instead
of
the
muddy
noisy
wide
brooks
of
three
months
ago
the
day
on
which
we
started
this
time
was
a
great
contrast
to
the
former
one
when
we
reached
the
saddle
i
have
before
told
you
of
instead
of
being
met
and
nearly
driven
back
by
a
violent
sutherly
buster
we
stopped
before
beginning
the
steep
descent
to
admire
the
exquisite
view
before
us
close
on
our
right
hand
rose
the
government
bush
out
of
which
we
get
our
firewood
standing
grand
and
gloomy
amid
huge
cliffs
and
crags
even
the
summer
sunshine
could
not
enliven
it
nor
the
twitter
and
chirrup
of
countless
birds
in
front
the
chain
of
hills
we
were
crossing
rolled
down
in
gradually
decreasing
hillocks
till
they
merged
in
the
vast
plains
before
us
stretching
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
towards
the
south
all
quivering
in
the
haze
and
glare
of
the
bright
sunlight
the
background
extending
along
the
horizon
was
formed
of
lofty
mountains
still
glistening
white
against
the
dazzling
blue
sky
just
at
our
feet
the
rockwood
paddocks
looked
like
carpets
of
emerald
velvet
spread
out
among
the
yellowish
tussocks
the
fences
which
enclose
them
were
either
golden
with
broom
and
gorse
or
gay
with
wild
roses
and
honeysuckle
beyond
these
we
saw
the
bright
patches
of
flowers
in
the
garden
and
nothing
could
be
more
effective
than
the
white
gable
of
the
house
standing
out
against
the
vast
black
birch
forest
which
clothed
the
steep
for
miles
the
contrast
was
so
picturesque
between
the
little
bit
of
civilization
and
culture
and
the
great
extent
of
wild
savage
scenery
around
it
after
the
utter
treelessness
of
our
own
immediate
neighbourhood
the
sight
of
such
a
mass
of
foliage
is
a
joy
to
my
eyes
the
day
following
our
arrival
was
birthday
and
we
prepared
to
enjoy
every
hour
of
it
the
party
assembled
was
a
very
large
one
consisting
however
chiefly
of
gentlemen
for
the
utmost
exertions
in
the
district
could
not
produce
more
than
five
ladies
altogether
and
two
of
those
had
come
an
immense
way
directly
after
breakfast
we
all
sallied
forth
the
ladies
equipped
in
light
cotton
dresses
muslin
is
too
thin
for
the
bush
and
little
sailor
hats
we
did
not
want
shady
ones
for
never
a
gleam
of
sun
can
penetrate
into
a
real
new
zealand
bush
unless
in
a
spot
which
has
been
very
much
cleared
strong
boots
with
nails
in
the
soles
to
help
us
to
keep
on
our
feet
up
the
steep
clay
and
a
stout
stick
completed
our
equipment
perhaps
we
were
not
very
smart
but
we
looked
like
going
at
all
events
i
can
answer
for
myself
that
i
enjoyed
every
moment
of
that
long
midsummer
holiday
most
intensely
though
i
fear
i
must
have
wearied
our
dear
charming
host
by
my
incessant
questions
about
the
names
of
the
trees
and
shrubs
and
of
the
habits
and
ways
of
the
thousands
of
birds
it
was
all
so
new
and
so
delightful
to
me
the
green
gloom
the
hoarse
croak
of
the
as
it
alighted
almost
at
our
feet
and
prepared
quite
careless
of
our
vicinity
to
tear
up
the
loose
soil
at
the
root
of
a
tall
tree
in
search
of
grubs
it
is
a
species
of
parrot
but
with
very
dingy
plumage
only
slightly
enlivened
by
a
few
scarlet
feathers
in
the
wing
the
air
was
gay
with
bright
green
parroquets
flitting
about
very
mischievous
they
are
i
am
told
taking
large
tithe
of
the
fruit
especially
of
the
cherries
every
now
and
then
we
stood
by
common
consent
silent
and
almost
breathless
to
listen
to
the
a
dingy
little
fellow
nearly
as
large
as
a
thrush
with
the
plumage
of
a
chaffinch
but
with
such
a
note
how
can
i
make
you
hear
its
wild
sweet
plaintive
tone
as
a
little
girl
of
the
party
said
just
as
if
it
had
a
bell
in
its
throat
but
indeed
it
would
require
a
whole
peal
of
silver
bells
to
ring
such
an
exquisite
chime
then
we
crept
softly
up
to
a
low
branch
to
have
a
good
look
at
the
tui
or
most
respectable
and
in
its
glossy
black
suit
with
a
singularly
trim
and
dapper
air
and
white
wattles
of
very
slender
feathers
indeed
they
are
as
fine
as
coquettishly
at
each
side
of
his
throat
exactly
like
bands
all
the
birds
were
quite
tame
and
instead
of
avoiding
us
seemed
inclined
to
examine
us
minutely
many
of
them
have
english
names
which
i
found
very
tantalising
especially
when
the
new
zealand
robin
was
announced
and
i
could
only
see
a
fat
little
ball
of
a
bird
with
a
breast
animals
there
are
none
no
quadruped
is
indigenous
to
new
zealand
except
a
rat
but
then
on
the
other
hand
we
are
as
free
from
snakes
and
all
vermin
as
if
patrick
himself
had
lived
here
our
host
has
turned
several
pheasants
into
this
forest
but
they
increase
very
slowly
on
account
of
the
wekas
however
the
happiness
of
this
morning
was
made
complete
by
our
putting
up
two
splendid
rocketers
we
could
only
make
our
way
by
the
paths
which
have
been
cut
through
the
bush
a
yard
off
the
track
it
is
impossible
to
stir
for
the
dense
undergrowth
in
the
ravines
and
steep
gullies
formed
by
the
creeks
grow
masses
of
ferns
of
all
sorts
spreading
like
large
shrubs
and
contrasting
by
their
light
bright
green
with
the
black
stems
of
the
around
them
there
are
a
few
pines
in
this
bush
but
not
many
i
can
give
you
no
idea
of
the
variety
among
the
shrubs
the
koromika
like
an
alpine
rose
a
compact
ball
of
foliage
the
a
tall
slender
stem
straight
as
a
line
with
a
few
long
leaves
at
the
top
turned
downwards
like
the
barb
of
a
spear
and
looking
exactly
like
a
lance
stuck
into
the
ground
the
varieties
of
matapo
a
beautiful
shrub
each
leaf
a
study
with
its
delicate
tracery
of
black
veins
on
a
ground
the
mappo
the
gohi
and
many
others
any
of
which
would
be
the
glory
of
an
english
shrubbery
but
they
seem
to
require
the
deep
shelter
of
their
native
bush
for
they
never
flourish
when
transplanted
i
noticed
the
slender
the
large
trees
have
of
the
ground
and
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
after
such
a
gale
as
we
had
three
weeks
ago
to
see
many
of
the
finest
blown
down
in
the
clearings
where
the
wind
could
reach
them
they
do
not
seem
to
have
any
at
all
merely
a
very
insufficient
network
of
fibres
seldom
of
any
size
which
spreads
a
short
way
along
the
surface
of
the
ground
as
long
as
a
bush
is
undisturbed
by
civilization
it
appears
to
be
impervious
to
wind
or
weather
but
as
soon
as
it
is
opened
and
cleared
a
little
it
begins
to
diminish
rapidly
there
are
traces
all
over
the
hills
of
vast
forests
having
once
existed
chiefly
of
totara
a
sort
of
red
pine
and
those
about
us
are
scattered
with
huge
logs
of
this
valuable
wood
all
bearing
traces
of
the
action
of
fire
but
shepherds
and
explorers
on
expeditions
looking
for
country
have
gradually
consumed
them
for
fuel
till
not
many
pieces
remain
except
on
the
highest
and
most
inaccessible
ranges
it
was
a
delightful
and
by
no
means
unacceptable
surprise
which
awaited
us
on
the
other
side
when
on
emerging
from
a
very
thick
part
of
the
bush
we
came
on
a
lovely
spot
a
true
meeting
of
the
waters
three
broad
bright
creeks
came
rushing
and
tumbling
down
from
the
densely
wooded
hills
about
to
join
and
flow
on
in
quite
a
river
amid
boulders
and
a
great
deal
of
hurry
and
fuss
a
contrast
to
the
profound
quiet
of
our
ramble
hitherto
the
silence
of
which
was
only
broken
by
the
twitter
and
whistle
of
the
birds
never
a
song
can
you
hear
only
a
sweet
chirrup
or
two
or
three
melodious
notes
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
there
was
the
welcome
sight
of
several
hampers
more
or
less
unpacked
and
the
gleam
of
a
white
tablecloth
on
the
moss
gentlemen
had
formed
themselves
into
a
commissariat
and
were
arranging
luncheon
we
could
see
the
champagne
cooling
in
a
sort
of
little
bay
protected
by
a
dam
of
big
stones
from
being
carried
down
the
stream
it
all
looked
very
charming
and
inviting
but
the
next
question
was
how
to
get
across
the
river
to
these
good
things
twelve
or
fourteen
feet
separated
us
hungry
and
tired
wanderers
as
we
were
from
food
and
rest
the
only
was
some
miles
lower
down
near
the
house
in
fact
so
even
the
most
timid
amongst
us
scouted
the
idea
of
retracing
our
steps
the
only
alternative
was
to
make
a
bridge
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
were
with
us
carried
an
axe
in
case
of
emergency
and
in
a
moment
we
heard
the
sharp
ringing
sounds
foretelling
the
fall
of
a
tree
in
the
others
of
the
party
were
dragging
out
fallen
logs
of
course
small
and
manageable
ones
and
laying
them
from
one
huge
boulder
to
another
working
up
to
their
knees
in
water
so
many
of
these
prostrate
trunks
were
convenient
that
a
cry
soon
arose
to
the
woodman
to
spare
the
trees
for
there
were
quite
enough
on
the
ground
however
two
substantial
poles
had
been
felled
and
these
were
laid
over
the
deepest
and
most
dangerous
part
of
the
current
the
bridge
was
soon
declared
passable
and
loud
shouts
from
the
opposite
side
proclaimed
that
luncheon
was
quite
ready
i
was
called
as
having
a
most
undeserved
reputation
for
pluck
to
make
trial
of
the
fabric
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
and
entreated
some
one
else
to
lead
the
forlorn
hope
so
a
very
quiet
young
lady
who
really
possessed
more
courage
in
her
little
finger
than
i
do
in
my
whole
body
volunteered
to
go
first
the
effect
from
the
bank
was
something
like
dancing
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
keep
one
balance
miss
kate
our
pioneer
walked
on
very
steadily
amid
great
applause
till
she
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
where
fortunately
the
water
was
shallow
but
strewed
with
masses
of
boulders
she
paused
an
instant
on
the
large
rock
on
which
the
ends
of
the
saplings
rested
and
then
started
afresh
for
the
last
half
of
her
journey
the
instant
she
put
her
foot
on
the
second
part
of
the
bridge
it
gave
way
with
a
loud
crash
and
the
poor
girl
with
great
presence
of
mind
caught
at
the
tree
she
had
just
crossed
and
so
saved
herself
from
a
ducking
of
course
she
had
plenty
of
help
in
an
instant
but
the
difficulty
was
to
regain
any
sort
of
footing
she
could
not
drop
into
the
water
and
there
was
apparently
no
way
of
dragging
herself
up
again
but
one
of
the
gentlemen
crept
on
hands
and
knees
along
the
unbroken
part
of
the
bridge
and
eventually
helped
her
up
the
sides
of
the
large
boulder
which
acted
as
a
pier
and
from
which
the
log
had
slipped
from
the
other
side
they
now
pushed
across
tall
slim
trees
freshly
cut
and
the
rest
of
the
passage
was
safe
enough
i
did
not
like
the
mode
of
transit
at
all
though
i
got
over
without
a
slip
but
it
requires
a
steady
head
to
cross
a
noisy
stream
on
two
slippery
round
poles
for
really
the
trees
were
little
thicker
laid
side
by
side
bending
with
every
step
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
all
to
know
that
we
were
not
to
return
by
the
same
path
through
the
bush
we
had
a
good
rest
after
lunch
i
lay
back
on
a
bed
of
fern
watching
the
numbers
of
little
birds
around
us
they
boldly
picked
up
our
crumbs
without
a
thought
of
possible
danger
presently
i
felt
a
tug
at
the
shawl
on
which
i
was
lying
i
was
too
lazy
and
dreamy
to
turn
my
head
so
the
next
thing
was
a
sharp
dig
on
my
arm
which
hurt
me
dreadfully
i
looked
round
and
there
was
a
weka
bent
on
thoroughly
investigating
the
intruder
into
its
domain
the
bird
looked
so
cool
and
unconcerned
that
i
had
not
the
heart
to
follow
my
first
impulse
and
throw
my
stick
at
it
but
my
forbearance
was
presently
rewarded
by
a
stab
on
the
ankle
which
fairly
made
me
jump
up
with
a
scream
when
my
persecutor
glided
gracefully
away
among
the
bushes
leaving
me
like
lord
ullin
lamenting
we
sauntered
home
slowly
gathering
armfuls
of
fern
and
a
large
variety
of
a
moss
so
common
on
the
west
coast
of
scotland
and
as
soon
as
we
had
had
some
tea
the
gentlemen
went
off
with
their
towels
to
bathe
in
the
creek
and
the
five
ladies
set
to
work
at
the
decorations
for
the
weaving
wreaths
and
arranging
enormous
bouquets
very
rapidly
we
had
such
a
wealth
of
flowers
to
work
with
that
our
task
was
not
difficult
the
most
amusing
part
of
the
story
is
however
that
the
ball
took
place
in
my
a
very
pompous
lady
of
my
acquaintance
always
prefaces
the
slenderest
anecdote
with
these
words
and
it
happened
in
this
wise
so
i
think
i
shall
avail
myself
of
the
de
it
happened
in
this
wise
then
large
room
had
been
added
to
the
house
lately
it
was
intended
for
a
but
for
some
reason
has
only
been
used
as
a
spare
but
as
it
may
possibly
return
to
its
original
destination
very
little
furniture
has
been
put
in
it
and
many
of
its
belongings
are
appropriate
to
a
we
called
in
the
servants
the
light
cane
bedstead
was
soon
deposited
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
in
the
garden
the
was
similarly
disposed
of
and
an
hour
work
with
hammer
and
nails
and
a
ball
of
string
turned
the
room
into
a
perfect
bower
of
ferns
and
flowers
great
ingenuity
was
displayed
in
the
arrangement
of
lights
and
the
result
was
a
very
pretty
we
are
always
eating
in
this
country
so
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
there
was
yet
another
meal
to
be
disposed
of
before
we
separated
to
dress
in
all
sorts
of
nooks
and
corners
white
muslin
was
the
universal
costume
as
it
can
be
packed
flat
and
smooth
my
gown
had
been
carried
over
by
f
in
front
of
his
saddle
in
a
very
small
parcel
i
covered
it
almost
entirely
with
sprays
of
the
moss
and
made
a
wreath
of
it
also
for
my
hair
i
think
that
with
the
other
ladies
roses
were
the
most
popular
decoration
and
they
looked
very
fresh
and
nice
i
was
the
universal
and
i
dressed
all
the
girls
heads
with
flowers
as
i
was
supposed
to
be
best
up
in
the
latest
fashions
in
the
meantime
the
piano
had
been
moved
to
the
of
the
and
at
ten
dancing
commenced
and
may
be
truly
said
to
have
been
kept
up
with
great
spirit
until
four
it
only
ceased
then
on
account
of
the
state
of
exhaustion
of
the
unfortunate
five
ladies
who
had
been
nearly
killed
with
incessant
dancing
i
threw
a
shawl
over
my
head
and
sauntered
alone
up
one
of
the
many
paths
close
to
the
house
which
led
into
the
bush
tired
as
i
was
i
shall
never
forget
the
beauty
and
romance
of
that
hour
the
delicious
crisp
feeling
of
the
morning
air
the
very
roses
growing
like
a
red
fringe
on
the
skirts
of
the
great
bush
seemed
awaking
to
fresh
life
and
perfume
the
numbers
of
gay
lizards
and
flies
coming
out
for
their
morning
meal
and
above
all
the
first
awakening
of
the
myriads
of
every
conceivable
twitter
and
chatter
and
chirrup
the
last
cry
of
a
very
pretty
little
owl
called
from
its
distinctly
uttered
words
the
as
it
flitted
away
before
the
dawn
to
the
highest
trees
all
made
up
a
jubilant
uproar
compared
to
which
one
of
the
crystal
palace
choruses
is
silence
i
sat
down
on
a
fallen
tree
and
listened
and
waited
every
moment
added
to
the
lovely
dawn
around
me
and
i
enjoyed
to
the
full
the
fragrant
smells
and
joyous
sounds
of
another
day
in
this
fresh
young
land
all
too
soon
came
a
loud
from
the
house
which
i
allowed
them
to
repeat
before
i
answered
this
was
to
tell
me
that
the
was
deserted
and
had
been
again
turned
into
a
when
i
opened
my
eyes
later
after
a
six
hours
nap
the
room
looked
like
a
fairy
bower
the
flowers
still
unfaded
we
had
another
picnic
the
next
day
up
the
gorge
of
a
river
amid
very
wild
and
beautiful
scenery
but
everything
had
been
arranged
so
as
to
make
the
expedition
an
easy
one
out
of
consideration
to
the
weary
five
the
day
after
this
we
rode
home
again
and
i
had
to
set
to
work
directly
to
prepare
for
my
own
christmas
party
to
the
shepherds
and
shearers
for
we
have
just
commenced
to
muster
the
sheep
and
the
shearing
will
be
in
full
force
by
christmas
day
one
great
object
i
have
in
view
in
giving
this
party
is
to
prevent
the
shearers
from
going
over
to
the
nearest
and
getting
tipsy
as
they
otherwise
would
so
i
have
taken
care
to
issue
my
invitations
early
i
found
great
difficulty
in
persuading
some
of
the
men
to
accept
as
they
had
not
brought
any
tidy
clothes
with
them
and
as
the
others
would
be
decently
indeed
well
dressed
they
did
not
like
putting
in
a
shabby
appearance
this
difficulty
was
obviated
by
f
hunting
up
some
of
the
things
he
had
worn
on
the
voyage
and
the
invited
guests
for
two
days
before
the
great
day
i
had
been
working
hard
studying
recipes
for
pies
and
puddings
and
scouring
the
country
in
search
of
delicacies
every
lady
was
most
kind
knowing
that
our
poor
exposed
garden
was
backward
i
had
sacks
of
green
peas
bushels
of
young
potatoes
and
baskets
of
strawberries
and
cherries
sent
to
me
from
all
round
the
country
i
made
poor
f
ride
twenty
miles
to
get
me
a
sirloin
of
beef
and
to
my
great
joy
two
beautiful
young
geese
arrived
as
a
present
only
the
day
before
it
is
a
point
of
honour
to
have
as
little
mutton
as
possible
on
these
occasions
as
the
great
treat
is
the
complete
change
of
fare
i
only
ventured
to
introduce
it
very
much
disguised
as
curry
or
in
pies
we
were
all
up
at
daylight
on
christmas
morning
and
off
to
the
nearest
little
copse
in
one
of
the
gullies
where
a
few
shrubs
and
small
trees
and
ferns
grow
to
gather
boughs
for
the
decoration
of
the
washhouse
marvels
were
done
in
the
carpentering
line
to
arrange
tables
around
its
walls
the
copper
which
at
first
presented
such
an
obstacle
to
the
symmetry
of
the
adornments
became
their
chief
glory
it
was
boarded
over
its
sides
completely
hidden
by
flags
and
ferns
and
the
dessert
placed
on
it
peeped
out
from
a
bower
of
greenery
i
do
know
how
we
got
our
own
breakfast
from
eleven
there
was
the
constant
announcement
a
horseman
coming
up
the
flat
and
by
twelve
when
i
as
beadle
announced
that
all
was
ready
a
large
congregation
of
came
trooping
into
my
little
as
soon
as
it
was
filled
the
others
clustered
round
the
door
but
all
could
hear
i
think
f
began
the
service
and
as
the
notes
of
the
christmas
anthem
swelled
up
i
found
the
tears
trembling
in
my
eyes
my
overwhelming
thought
was
that
it
actually
was
the
very
first
time
those
words
had
ever
been
sung
or
said
in
that
valley
you
in
england
can
hardly
realize
the
immensity
of
such
a
thought
the
first
time
since
the
world
was
made
i
think
the
next
sensation
was
one
of
extreme
happiness
it
seemed
such
a
privilege
to
be
allowed
to
hold
the
initial
christmas
service
i
had
to
grasp
this
idea
very
tight
to
keep
down
the
terrible
which
i
felt
all
day
for
almost
the
first
time
there
are
moments
when
no
advantages
or
privileges
can
repress
what
aytoun
calls
the
deep
unutterable
woe
which
none
save
exiles
feel
the
service
only
lasted
half
an
hour
beginning
and
ending
with
a
hymn
there
were
three
women
present
besides
me
my
two
servants
and
the
nice
young
wife
of
a
neighbouring
shepherd
it
was
a
sultry
day
not
a
breath
of
air
but
still
it
is
never
oppressive
at
this
elevation
we
wound
up
a
big
set
it
going
in
the
late
washhouse
and
marshalled
the
guests
in
they
were
extremely
shy
as
a
rule
and
so
we
soon
went
away
and
left
them
to
themselves
they
ate
incessantly
for
two
hours
and
i
hope
they
enjoyed
themselves
then
the
men
lounged
about
the
stables
and
smoked
and
the
three
women
cleared
away
a
little
f
and
our
gentlemen
guests
got
up
athletic
sports
in
the
shade
which
seemed
very
popular
though
it
appeared
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
take
on
such
a
hot
day
as
the
sun
sank
below
the
hills
it
grew
much
cooler
and
my
two
maids
came
with
a
shamefaced
request
to
be
allowed
to
dance
in
the
kitchen
i
inquired
about
the
music
that
was
provided
for
by
a
fiddle
and
some
pipes
so
i
consented
but
i
found
they
wanted
me
to
start
them
i
selected
as
my
partner
a
very
decent
young
farmer
who
lives
near
but
has
left
his
farm
and
is
at
work
branding
our
sheep
all
the
pride
and
delight
of
his
mate
was
much
greater
than
my
partner
he
stood
near
his
friend
prompting
him
through
the
mazes
of
the
most
extraordinary
quadrille
you
ever
saw
with
two
extra
figures
then
there
was
an
endless
polka
in
which
everybody
danced
like
queen
elizabeth
high
and
disposedly
but
the
ball
ended
at
nine
and
we
were
given
some
cold
dinner
for
which
we
were
all
very
ready
the
next
morning
saw
the
remains
of
the
festivity
cleared
away
and
every
one
hard
at
work
again
for
this
is
our
very
busiest
season
the
work
of
the
station
however
is
carried
on
at
the
homestead
two
miles
off
f
is
there
all
day
long
but
i
see
nothing
of
it
while
the
shearers
hearts
were
tender
i
asked
them
to
come
over
to
church
on
sunday
and
they
have
promised
to
do
so
i
lend
them
quantities
of
books
and
papers
also
so
as
to
keep
them
amused
and
away
from
the
letter
xv
everyday
station
life
broomielaw
january
you
tell
me
to
describe
our
daily
and
domestic
surroundings
i
dare
say
it
will
appear
to
be
a
monotonous
and
insignificant
existence
enough
when
put
on
paper
but
it
suits
me
exactly
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
have
enough
to
do
and
also
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
i
am
of
some
little
use
to
my
a
lady
influence
out
here
appears
to
be
very
great
and
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
she
represents
refinement
and
culture
in
arnold
sense
of
the
words
and
her
footsteps
on
a
new
soil
such
as
this
should
be
marked
by
a
trail
of
light
of
course
every
improvement
must
be
the
work
of
time
but
i
find
my
neighbours
very
willing
to
help
me
in
my
attempts
a
few
lines
will
be
sufficient
to
sketch
a
day
routine
the
first
of
my
duties
is
one
i
especially
delight
in
i
am
out
very
early
with
a
large
tin
dish
of
scraps
mixed
with
a
few
handfuls
of
wheat
and
my
appearance
is
the
signal
for
a
great
commotion
among
all
my
fowls
and
ducks
and
pigeons
such
waddling
and
flying
and
running
with
outstretched
wings
to
me
in
fact
i
receive
a
morning
greeting
from
all
the
about
the
place
i
am
nearly
knocked
down
by
the
big
the
calves
come
rushing
with
awkward
gambols
towards
me
for
a
bit
of
the
fowls
bread
whilst
the
dogs
look
out
for
a
bone
but
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
the
poultry
hold
their
own
indeed
an
anxious
hen
eager
to
secure
a
breakfast
for
her
chicks
will
fly
at
a
big
dog
and
beat
him
away
from
a
savoury
morsel
i
think
i
ought
not
to
omit
mentioning
the
devotion
of
a
small
pig
it
is
an
exact
illustration
of
the
french
proverb
which
speaks
of
the
inequality
of
love
for
i
am
quite
passive
and
do
not
respond
in
the
least
to
the
little
affection
which
is
the
most
absurd
thing
you
ever
saw
especially
as
it
proceeds
from
so
unromantic
an
animal
late
in
the
spring
that
is
to
say
about
november
last
we
were
all
returning
from
a
great
expedition
when
i
saw
one
of
the
party
coming
down
a
steep
hill
near
the
house
with
a
small
and
wild
pig
under
each
arm
he
was
very
proud
of
his
captives
placed
them
in
a
box
with
some
straw
and
fed
them
like
babies
out
of
a
bottle
we
laughed
at
him
very
much
but
when
he
went
away
he
begged
so
earnestly
that
the
pigs
should
be
reared
that
we
promised
to
keep
them
in
a
few
days
they
became
perfectly
tame
and
were
very
handsome
little
creatures
and
one
of
them
attached
itself
to
me
following
me
all
about
even
into
the
house
but
i
really
could
not
stand
accompanying
me
in
all
my
walks
and
as
far
as
it
could
in
my
rides
many
a
time
have
i
seen
poor
little
piggy
carried
down
a
creek
by
the
current
squealing
piteously
but
it
was
evidently
a
case
of
many
waters
can
not
quench
love
for
a
little
further
on
piggy
would
appear
very
much
baked
but
holding
out
gallantly
till
sheer
exhaustion
compelled
him
to
give
in
when
he
would
lie
down
under
a
tussock
apparently
dying
but
as
we
were
coming
home
in
the
dusk
helen
my
pretty
bay
mare
has
given
many
a
shy
at
piggy
starting
up
from
his
shelter
with
gambols
and
squeals
of
joy
it
is
always
a
great
temptation
to
loiter
about
in
the
lovely
fresh
morning
air
but
i
have
to
be
dressed
in
time
for
prayers
and
breakfast
at
nine
directly
after
breakfast
i
go
into
the
kitchen
sometimes
it
is
only
necessary
to
give
orders
or
instructions
but
generally
i
find
that
practice
is
much
better
than
precept
and
i
see
to
the
soup
myself
and
make
the
pudding
the
joint
can
take
care
of
itself
you
have
often
asked
me
what
we
have
to
eat
so
this
will
be
a
good
opportunity
of
introducing
our
daily
bill
of
fare
prefacing
it
with
my
recorded
opinion
that
here
is
no
place
in
the
world
where
you
can
live
so
cheaply
and
so
well
as
on
a
new
zealand
sheep
station
when
once
you
get
a
start
of
course
it
is
expensive
at
first
setting
everything
going
but
that
would
be
the
case
in
any
country
i
will
begin
at
the
very
beginning
porridge
for
breakfast
with
new
milk
and
cream
to
follow
mutton
chops
mutton
ham
or
mutton
curry
or
broiled
mutton
and
mushrooms
not
shabby
little
fragments
of
meat
broiled
but
beautiful
tender
steaks
off
a
leg
tea
or
coffee
and
bread
and
butter
with
as
many
eggs
as
we
choose
to
consume
then
for
dinner
at
one
we
have
soup
a
joint
vegetables
and
a
pudding
in
summer
we
have
fresh
fruit
stewed
instead
of
a
pudding
with
whipped
cream
i
was
a
proud
and
happy
woman
the
first
day
my
cream
remained
cream
and
did
not
turn
into
butter
for
generally
my
zeal
outran
my
discretion
and
i
did
not
know
when
to
leave
off
whipping
we
have
supper
about
seven
but
this
is
a
moveable
feast
consisting
of
tea
again
mutton
cooked
in
some
form
of
entree
eggs
bread
and
butter
and
a
cake
of
my
manufacture
i
must
however
acknowledge
that
at
almost
every
other
station
you
would
get
more
dainties
such
as
jam
and
preserves
of
all
sorts
than
we
can
boast
of
yet
for
as
littimer
says
to
david
copperfield
we
are
very
young
exceedingly
young
sir
our
have
not
come
into
full
bearing
and
our
other
resources
are
still
quite
undeveloped
however
i
have
wandered
away
terribly
from
my
first
intention
of
telling
you
of
the
daily
occupations
to
a
description
of
our
daily
food
after
i
have
finished
all
my
little
fussings
about
the
house
i
join
f
who
has
probably
been
for
some
time
quietly
settled
down
at
his
and
we
work
together
at
books
and
writing
till
dinner
after
that
meal
f
like
tootes
resumes
his
studies
but
i
go
and
feed
my
fowls
again
and
if
i
am
very
idly
disposed
i
sit
on
a
hencoop
in
the
shade
and
watch
the
various
tempers
of
my
chickens
and
ducklings
a
little
later
f
and
i
go
out
for
some
hours
if
it
is
not
too
hot
he
takes
his
rifle
and
we
go
over
the
hills
but
this
is
really
only
suitable
exercise
for
a
fine
winter
day
at
this
time
of
year
we
either
go
for
a
walk
or
a
ride
generally
the
latter
not
a
little
shabby
canter
but
a
long
stretching
gallop
for
miles
and
miles
perhaps
stopping
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
a
neighbour
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
off
and
then
coming
slowly
home
in
the
delicious
gloaming
with
the
peculiar
fresh
crisp
feeling
which
the
atmosphere
always
has
here
the
moment
the
sun
sets
no
matter
how
hot
the
day
has
been
i
can
hardly
hope
to
make
you
understand
how
enjoyable
our
twilight
hours
are
with
no
fear
of
damp
or
malaria
to
spoil
them
every
turn
of
the
track
as
we
slowly
wind
up
the
valley
showing
us
some
beautiful
glimpse
of
distant
mountain
peaks
and
above
all
such
sunset
splendours
gradually
fading
away
into
the
deep
pure
beauty
of
a
summer
night
in
one
of
our
rides
the
other
day
after
crossing
a
low
range
of
hills
we
suddenly
dropped
down
on
what
would
be
called
in
england
a
hamlet
but
here
it
is
designated
by
the
extraordinary
name
of
a
nest
of
cockatoos
this
expression
puzzled
me
so
much
when
i
first
heard
it
that
i
must
give
you
as
minute
an
explanation
as
i
myself
found
necessary
to
the
comprehension
of
the
subject
when
a
shepherd
has
saved
a
hundred
pounds
or
the
better
class
of
immigrant
arrives
with
a
little
capital
the
favourite
investment
is
in
freehold
land
which
they
can
purchase
in
sections
of
twenty
acres
and
upwards
at
pounds
the
acre
the
next
step
is
to
build
a
sod
but
with
two
rooms
on
their
property
thatching
it
with
tohi
or
swamp
grass
a
door
and
a
couple
of
all
ready
glazed
are
brought
from
christchurch
in
the
dray
with
the
family
and
the
household
goods
after
this
rough
and
ready
shelter
is
provided
the
father
and
sons
begin
fencing
their
land
and
gradually
it
all
assumes
a
cultivated
appearance
and
are
added
a
little
garden
gay
with
common
english
flowers
is
made
in
front
of
the
house
whose
ugly
walls
are
gradually
hidden
by
creepers
and
the
homestead
looks
both
picturesque
and
prosperous
these
small
farmers
are
called
cockatoos
in
australia
by
the
squatters
or
who
dislike
them
for
buying
up
the
best
bits
of
land
on
their
runs
and
say
that
like
a
cockatoo
the
small
freeholder
alights
on
good
ground
extracts
all
he
can
from
it
and
then
flies
away
to
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
but
the
real
fact
is
that
the
poor
farmer
perhaps
finds
his
section
is
too
far
from
a
market
so
he
is
forced
to
abandon
it
and
move
nearer
a
town
where
the
best
and
most
productive
land
has
been
bought
up
already
and
he
has
to
begin
again
at
a
disadvantage
however
whether
the
name
is
just
or
not
it
is
a
recognized
one
here
and
i
have
heard
a
man
say
in
answer
to
a
question
about
his
usual
occupation
i
a
cockatoo
this
particular
nest
appeared
to
me
very
well
off
comparatively
speaking
for
though
the
men
complained
sadly
of
the
low
price
of
their
wheat
and
oats
still
there
was
nothing
like
poverty
to
be
seen
ready
money
was
doubtless
scarce
and
an
extensive
system
of
barter
appeared
to
prevail
but
still
they
all
looked
well
fed
and
well
clothed
sickness
was
unknown
among
them
and
it
did
one
heart
good
to
see
the
children
such
sturdy
limbs
bright
fearless
eyes
and
glowing
faces
they
have
abundance
of
excellent
food
each
cottager
has
one
or
two
cows
and
the
little
ones
take
these
out
to
pasture
on
the
hills
so
they
are
in
the
open
air
nearly
all
day
but
their
ignorance
is
appalling
many
of
them
had
never
even
been
christened
there
was
no
school
or
church
within
thirty
miles
or
more
and
although
the
parents
seemed
all
tidy
decent
people
and
deplored
the
state
of
things
they
were
powerless
to
help
it
the
father
and
elder
sons
work
hard
all
day
the
mother
has
to
do
everything
even
to
making
the
candles
for
the
family
there
is
no
time
or
possibility
of
teaching
the
children
the
neighbouring
squatters
do
not
like
to
encourage
settlers
to
buy
up
their
land
therefore
they
carefully
avoid
making
things
pleasant
for
a
new
nest
and
the
cockatoos
are
nobody
business
so
as
far
as
educational
advantages
go
they
are
perfectly
destitute
when
i
mentioned
my
discovery
of
this
hamlet
and
my
dismay
at
the
state
of
neglect
in
which
so
many
fine
children
were
growing
up
every
one
warned
me
not
to
interfere
assuring
me
the
cockatoo
was
a
very
independent
bird
that
he
considered
he
had
left
all
the
ladies
bountiful
and
blanket
and
coal
charities
behind
him
in
the
old
country
that
in
short
as
it
is
generally
put
jack
is
as
good
as
his
master
out
here
and
any
attempt
at
patronage
would
be
deeply
resented
but
i
determined
to
try
the
effect
of
a
little
visiting
among
the
cottages
and
was
most
agreeably
surprised
at
the
kind
and
cordial
welcome
i
received
the
women
liked
to
have
some
one
to
chat
to
about
their
domestic
affairs
and
were
most
hospitable
in
offers
of
tea
and
everywhere
invitations
to
come
again
were
given
so
the
next
week
i
ventured
to
invite
the
men
over
to
our
sunday
services
those
who
were
fond
of
reading
eagerly
accepted
the
offer
to
join
the
and
at
last
we
started
the
educational
subject
many
plans
were
discussed
and
finally
we
arranged
for
one
woman
who
had
received
an
excellent
education
and
was
quite
fitted
for
the
post
to
commence
a
but
this
entailed
so
much
loss
of
her
valuable
time
that
the
terms
she
is
obliged
to
ask
seem
disproportionately
high
to
the
people
means
she
wants
shillings
and
pence
a
week
with
each
child
and
this
is
terrible
heavy
on
the
head
of
a
family
who
is
anxious
and
willing
to
give
them
some
schooling
however
the
plan
is
to
be
tried
and
i
have
promised
to
start
them
with
books
slates
copybooks
etc
it
was
quite
touching
to
hear
their
earnest
entreaties
that
f
would
come
over
on
sunday
sometimes
and
hold
a
service
there
but
i
tried
to
show
them
this
could
not
be
managed
the
tears
actually
came
into
their
eyes
when
i
talked
of
the
happiness
it
would
be
to
see
a
little
church
and
school
in
their
midst
and
the
almost
invariable
remark
was
ah
but
it
be
a
far
day
first
and
so
i
fear
it
will
a
very
far
day
but
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
if
you
propose
one
definite
object
to
yourself
as
the
serious
purpose
of
your
life
you
will
accomplish
it
some
day
well
the
purpose
of
my
life
henceforward
is
to
raise
money
somehow
or
somewhere
to
build
a
little
wooden
licensed
for
service
to
be
held
whenever
a
missionary
clergyman
comes
by
and
to
pay
the
salary
of
a
schoolmaster
and
mistress
so
that
the
poor
cockatoo
need
not
be
charged
more
than
threepence
a
week
for
each
child
the
board
of
education
will
give
a
third
of
the
sum
required
when
have
been
already
raised
but
it
is
difficult
to
collect
subscriptions
or
indeed
to
induce
the
squatters
to
listen
to
any
plan
for
improving
the
condition
of
the
small
farmers
and
every
year
which
slips
away
and
leaves
these
swarms
of
children
in
ignorance
adds
to
the
difficulty
of
training
them
note

there
never

winds
this
bad
weather
comes
after
a
long
spell
of
lovely
bright
summer
days
and
is
very
welcome
to
fill
up
the
failing
creeks
in
the
lower
ranges
of
hills
i
must
tell
you
how
much
we
have
been
enjoying
our
visit
here
f
knows
this
part
of
the
country
well
but
it
is
quite
new
to
me
and
a
great
contrast
to
the
other
scenery
i
have
described
to
you
we
had
long
talked
of
paying
h
a
visit
at
his
bachelor
cottage
on
his
station
far
back
among
the
high
ranges
of
hills
but
no
time
was
fixed
so
i
was
rather
taken
by
surprise
when
last
week
he
drove
up
to
broomielaw
in
a
light
american
waggon
with
a
pair
of
stout
horses
and
announced
that
he
had
come
to
take
us
to
his
place
next
day
there
was
no
reason
against
this
plan
and
we
agreed
at
once
the
next
morning
saw
us
on
the
road
after
an
early
breakfast
we
had
to
drive
about
miles
round
whereas
it
would
have
been
only
twenty
miles
riding
across
the
hills
but
our
kind
host
thought
that
it
would
be
much
more
comfortable
for
me
to
be
able
to
take
a
in
the
carriage
instead
of
the
usual
system
of
one
is
obliged
to
adopt
travelling
on
horseback
we
made
our
first
stage
at
the
station
of
the
c
on
the
horarata
but
we
could
not
remain
to
luncheon
as
they
wished
having
to
push
on
further
and
as
it
turned
out
it
was
most
fortunate
we
took
advantage
of
the
first
part
of
the
day
to
get
over
the
ground
between
us
and
our
destination
for
the
gentle
breeze
which
had
been
blowing
since
we
started
gradually
freshened
into
a
tremendous
right
in
our
teeth
all
the
rest
of
our
way
the
poor
horses
bent
their
heads
as
low
as
possible
and
pulled
bravely
at
their
collars
up
hill
the
whole
time
among
the
mountains
the
wind
rushed
with
redoubled
fury
down
the
narrow
gorges
and
became
icily
cold
as
we
neared
the
snowy
ranges
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
hills
for
the
thick
mist
though
i
knew
we
must
have
a
magnificent
view
before
us
we
took
refuge
for
an
hour
just
to
rest
the
horses
at
windwhistle
and
i
certainly
expected
the
house
to
come
down
whilst
we
were
there
i
can
hardly
tell
you
anything
of
the
rest
of
the
drive
for
i
was
really
frightened
at
my
first
experience
of
a
howling
out
of
doors
and
h
made
me
sit
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
and
heaped
over
me
all
the
cloaks
and
shawls
we
had
brought
it
was
delightful
to
find
ourselves
under
shelter
at
last
in
a
pretty
bright
snug
room
with
lots
of
books
and
and
a
blazing
fire
you
must
remember
in
midsummer
the
next
morning
was
perfectly
calm
and
the
lake
as
serene
as
if
no
storm
had
been
dashing
its
water
in
huge
breakers
against
the
beach
only
a
few
hours
before
the
view
from
the
was
lovely
just
beneath
the
window
there
was
a
little
lawn
as
green
as
possible
from
the
spray
with
which
the
lake
had
washed
it
yesterday
beyond
this
a
low
hedge
an
open
meadow
a
fringe
of
white
pebbly
beach
and
then
a
wide
expanse
of
water
within
one
little
wooded
island
and
shut
in
gradually
from
our
view
by
spurs
of
hills
running
down
to
the
shore
sometimes
in
bold
steep
cliffs
and
again
in
gentle
declivities
with
little
strips
of
bush
or
scrub
growing
in
the
steep
gullies
between
them
the
lake
extends
some
way
beyond
where
we
lose
sight
of
it
being
twelve
miles
long
and
four
miles
broad
a
few
yards
from
the
beach
it
is
over
six
hundred
feet
deep
nothing
but
a
painting
could
give
you
any
idea
of
the
blue
of
sky
and
water
that
morning
the
violent
wind
of
yesterday
seemed
to
have
blown
every
cloud
below
the
horizon
for
i
could
not
see
the
least
white
film
anywhere
behind
the
lower
hills
which
surround
the
lake
rises
a
splendid
snowy
range
altogether
you
can
not
imagine
a
more
enchanting
prospect
than
the
one
i
stood
and
looked
at
it
made
me
think
of
miss
procter
lines
my
eyes
grow
dim
as
still
i
gaze
and
gaze
upon
that
mountain
pass
that
leads
or
so
it
seems
to
some
far
happy
land
known
in
a
world
of
dreams
all
this
time
whilst
i
was
looking
out
of
the
window
in
most
unusual
idleness
h
and
f
were
making
constant
journeys
between
the
and
the
and
at
last
i
was
entreated
to
go
and
put
on
my
hat
while
doing
this
i
heard
cupboards
being
opened
and
a
great
bustle
so
when
i
reached
the
shore
i
was
not
so
much
surprised
as
they
expected
to
see
in
the
pretty
little
which
was
moored
to
a
primitive
sort
of
jetty
made
out
of
a
broken
old
punt
the
materials
for
at
least
two
substantial
meals
in
case
of
being
kept
out
by
a
sudden
i
was
especially
glad
to
notice
a
little
kettle
among
the
and
there
were
cloaks
and
wraps
of
all
kinds
to
provide
against
the
worst
four
gentlemen
and
i
made
up
the
crew
and
passengers
and
a
very
merry
set
we
were
behaving
extremely
like
children
out
for
a
holiday
the
wind
was
a
trifle
light
for
sailing
so
the
gentlemen
pulled
but
very
lazily
and
not
at
all
in
good
form
as
the
object
of
each
oarsman
seemed
to
be
to
do
as
little
work
as
possible
however
we
got
on
somehow
a
light
puff
helping
us
now
and
then
but
our
progress
was
hardly
perceptible
i
had
been
for
a
long
time
gazing
down
into
the
clear
blue
depth
of
water
every
now
and
then
seeing
a
flash
of
the
white
sand
shining
at
the
bottom
when
i
was
half
startled
by
our
host
standing
suddenly
up
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
then
i
found
that
we
were
a
couple
of
miles
away
from
our
and
that
we
had
turned
a
corner
formed
by
a
steep
spur
and
were
running
right
into
what
appeared
a
grove
of
growing
at
the
water
edge
the
rata
only
grows
in
the
hills
and
near
water
it
is
a
species
of
myrtle
with
a
flower
exactly
like
a
myrtle
in
character
but
of
a
brilliant
deep
scarlet
colour
and
twice
as
large
when
the
bowsprit
touched
the
which
drooped
like
a
curtain
into
the
water
h
made
a
signal
to
lower
the
mast
and
parting
the
thick
foliage
before
us
with
both
hands
the
way
the
boat
had
on
her
sent
us
gently
through
the
screen
of
scarlet
flowers
and
glossy
green
leaves
into
such
a
lovely
fairy
cove
before
us
was
a
little
white
beach
of
fine
sparkling
sand
against
which
the
water
broke
in
tiny
wavelets
and
all
around
a
perfect
bower
of
every
variety
of
fern
and
moss
kept
green
by
streams
no
thicker
than
a
silver
thread
trickling
down
here
and
there
with
a
subdued
tinkling
sound
we
all
sat
quite
silent
the
boat
kept
back
just
inside
the
entrance
by
the
steersman
holding
on
to
a
branch
it
was
a
sudden
contrast
from
the
sparkling
sunshine
and
brightness
outside
all
life
and
colour
and
warmth
to
the
tender
green
profound
shade
and
quiet
in
this
mossy
hum
as
the
people
about
here
call
it
do
not
fancy
anything
damp
or
chilly
no
it
was
like
a
natural
temple
perfect
repose
and
refreshment
to
the
eyes
dazzled
with
the
brilliant
outside
colouring
centuries
ago
there
must
have
been
a
great
landslip
here
for
the
side
of
the
mountain
is
quite
hollowed
out
and
nature
has
gradually
covered
the
ugly
brown
rent
with
the
thickest
tapestry
of
her
most
delicate
handiwork
i
noticed
two
varieties
of
the
its
slender
black
stem
making
the
most
exquisite
tracery
among
the
vivid
greens
there
was
no
tint
of
colour
except
green
when
once
we
passed
the
curtain
of
only
the
white
and
shining
fairy
beach
and
the
gleaming
threads
of
water
as
we
sat
there
perfectly
still
and
entranced
a
sort
of
delicious
mesmeric
feeling
stole
over
me
i
thought
of
the
chant
there
is
no
joy
but
calm
with
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
dim
perception
of
what
they
meant
perhaps
but
it
was
over
all
too
quickly
prosaic
words
of
direction
to
back
water
called
us
from
shade
to
light
and
in
a
moment
more
we
were
in
front
of
the
admiring
their
splendid
colouring
and
our
little
boat
was
dancing
away
over
the
bright
waves
with
her
white
wings
set
and
her
bows
pointed
towards
the
little
toy
island
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
it
was
no
question
now
of
rowing
a
nice
fresh
breeze
from
the
south
the
point
here
sent
us
swiftly
and
steadily
through
the
water
what
a
morning
it
was
the
air
was
positively
intoxicating
making
you
feel
that
the
mere
fact
of
being
a
living
creature
with
lungs
to
inhale
such
an
atmosphere
was
a
great
boon
we
have
a
good
deal
of
disagreeable
weather
and
a
small
proportion
of
bad
weather
but
in
no
other
part
of
the
world
i
believe
does
nature
so
thoroughly
understand
how
to
make
a
fine
day
as
in
new
zealand
a
little
after
we
ran
our
boat
to
the
lee
of
the
island
and
whilst
she
was
steadied
by
the
same
primitive
method
of
holding
on
to
branches
of
manuka
and
other
scrub
i
scrambled
out
and
up
a
little
cliff
where
a
goat
could
hardly
have
found
footing
till
i
reached
a
spot
big
enough
to
stand
on
from
whence
i
anxiously
watched
the
disembarkation
of
some
of
the
provisions
and
of
the
gridiron
and
kettle
in
a
few
moments
we
were
all
safely
ashore
and
busy
collecting
dry
fern
and
brushwood
for
a
fire
it
was
rather
a
trial
of
patience
to
wait
till
the
great
blaze
had
subsided
before
we
attempted
to
cook
our
chops
which
were
all
neatly
prepared
ready
for
us
some
large
potatoes
were
put
to
bake
in
the
ashes
the
tin
plates
were
warmed
it
is
a
great
art
not
to
overheat
them
when
you
have
to
keep
them
on
your
lap
whilst
you
eat
your
chop
we
were
all
so
terribly
hungry
that
we
were
obliged
to
have
a
course
of
bread
and
cheese
and
sardines
it
was
really
quite
impossible
to
wait
patiently
for
the
chops
the
officiating
cook
scolded
us
well
for
our
vandalism
and
the
next
moment
we
detected
him
in
the
act
of
devouring
a
potato
the
fragments
of
our
meal
must
have
been
a
great
boon
to
the
colony
of
wekas
who
inhabit
the
island
for
as
they
increase
and
multiply
prodigiously
their
provisions
must
often
fall
short
in
so
small
a
space
no
one
can
imagine
how
these
birds
originally
came
here
for
the
island
is
at
least
two
miles
from
the
nearest
point
of
land
they
can
neither
swim
nor
fly
and
as
every
man
hand
is
against
them
no
one
would
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
bring
them
over
but
here
they
are
in
spite
of
all
the
apparent
impossibilities
attending
their
arrival
more
tame
and
impudent
than
ever
it
was
dangerous
to
leave
your
bread
unwatched
for
an
instant
and
indeed
i
saw
one
gliding
off
with
an
empty
sardine
tin
in
its
beak
i
wonder
how
it
liked
oil
and
little
scales
they
considered
a
cork
a
great
prize
and
carried
several
off
triumphantly
after
luncheon
there
was
the
usual
interval
of
rest
and
pipes
on
the
part
of
the
gentlemen
i
explored
a
little
but
there
is
nothing
very
pretty
or
abundant
in
the
way
of
wild
flowers
in
the
parts
of
new
zealand
which
i
have
seen
white
violets
and
a
ground
clematis
are
the
only
ones
i
have
come
across
in
any
quantity
the
manuka
a
sort
of
scrub
has
a
pretty
blossom
like
a
diminutive
michaelmas
daisy
white
petals
and
a
brown
centre
with
a
very
aromatic
odour
and
this
little
flower
is
succeeded
by
a
berry
with
the
same
strong
smell
and
taste
of
spice
the
shepherds
sometimes
make
an
infusion
of
these
when
they
are
very
for
tea
but
it
must
be
like
drinking
a
decoction
of
cloves
about
three
we
and
sailed
a
little
higher
up
the
lake
beyond
the
point
where
we
lose
sight
of
it
from
h
house
every
moment
opening
out
fresh
and
more
beautiful
glimpses
quite
the
opposite
end
of
the
shore
is
fringed
with
a
thick
deep
forest
and
another
station
has
been
built
there
at
which
i
am
told
the
scenery
is
still
more
magnificent
at
first
i
was
inclined
to
wonder
where
the
sheep
live
amid
all
this
picturesque
but
mountainous
country
however
i
find
that
between
and
among
these
hills
stretch
immense
valleys
or
flats
as
they
are
called
here
which
are
warm
and
sheltered
in
winter
and
afford
plenty
of
food
for
them
then
in
summer
they
go
up
to
the
mountains
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
muster
these
ranges
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
confess
to
another
meal
before
we
returned
home
but
there
was
a
lovely
tempting
spot
in
a
little
harbour
and
so
we
landed
and
boiled
some
water
and
had
a
capital
cup
of
tea
you
require
to
be
out
as
we
were
from
morning
till
night
in
such
an
air
as
this
to
know
what
it
is
to
feel
either
hungry
or
sleepy
in
perfection
the
next
day
we
made
a
similar
excursion
exploring
the
opposite
shore
of
the
lake
but
before
we
started
our
host
distrusted
the
appearance
of
certain
clouds
and
sent
round
horses
to
meet
us
at
the
point
where
we
were
going
to
lunch
and
it
was
just
as
well
he
did
so
for
a
stiff
breeze
sprang
up
from
the
which
would
have
kept
us
out
all
night
so
we
mounted
the
horses
instead
of
having
first
secured
the
boat
and
cantered
home
we
passed
several
smaller
lakes
there
is
a
perfect
chain
of
them
among
these
hills
and
i
was
much
amused
at
the
names
bestowed
on
them
according
to
the
tastes
or
caprice
of
the
whose
runs
happen
to
include
them
for
instance
two
are
called
respectively
geraldine
and
ida
whilst
three
which
lie
close
together
rejoice
in
the
somewhat
extraordinary
names
of
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
letter
xvii
my
first
and
last
experience
of
camping
out
broomielaw
april
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
this
mail
except
of
a
rather
ridiculous
expedition
which
we
made
last
week
and
which
involved
our
spending
the
whole
night
on
the
top
of
the
highest
hill
on
our
run
you
will
probably
wonder
what
put
such
an
idea
into
our
heads
so
i
must
preface
my
account
by
a
little
explanation
whenever
i
meet
any
people
who
came
here
in
the
very
early
days
of
the
colony
only
sixteen
years
ago
after
all
i
delight
in
persuading
them
to
tell
me
about
their
adventures
and
hardships
during
those
primitive
times
and
these
narratives
have
the
greatest
fascination
for
me
as
they
always
end
happily
no
one
ever
seems
to
have
died
of
his
miseries
or
even
to
have
suffered
seriously
in
any
way
from
them
so
i
find
the
greatest
delight
in
listening
to
the
stories
of
the
pilgrims
i
envy
them
dreadfully
for
having
gone
through
so
much
with
such
spirit
and
cheerfulness
and
ever
since
i
came
here
i
have
regretted
that
the
rapid
advance
of
civilization
in
new
zealand
precludes
the
possibility
of
being
really
uncomfortable
this
makes
me
feel
like
an
impostor
for
i
am
convinced
that
my
english
friends
think
of
me
with
the
deepest
pity
as
of
one
cut
off
from
the
refinements
and
comforts
of
life
whereas
i
really
am
surrounded
by
every
necessary
and
many
of
its
luxuries
and
there
is
no
reason
but
that
of
expense
why
one
should
not
have
all
of
these
one
class
of
narratives
is
peculiarly
attractive
to
me
i
like
to
hear
of
benighted
or
belated
travellers
when
they
have
had
to
camp
out
as
it
is
technically
called
and
have
lived
in
constant
hope
of
meeting
with
an
adventure
which
would
give
me
a
similar
experience
but
i
am
gradually
becoming
convinced
that
this
is
almost
impossible
by
fair
means
so
i
have
been
trying
for
some
time
past
to
excite
in
the
breasts
of
our
home
party
and
of
our
nearest
neighbours
an
ardent
desire
to
see
the
sun
rise
from
the
top
of
flagpole
a
hill
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
only
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
house
as
soon
as
they
were
sufficiently
enthusiastic
on
the
subject
i
broached
my
favourite
project
of
our
all
going
up
there
and
camping
out
on
the
highest
peak
strange
to
say
the
plan
did
not
meet
with
any
opposition
even
from
f
who
has
had
to
camp
out
many
a
night
and
with
whom
therefore
the
novelty
may
be
said
to
have
worn
off
two
gentlemen
of
the
proposed
party
were
new
chums
like
myself
and
were
strongly
in
favour
of
a
little
roughing
always
are
i
observe
f
hesitated
a
little
about
giving
a
final
consent
on
the
score
of
its
being
rather
too
late
in
the
year
and
talked
of
a
postponement
till
next
summer
but
we
would
not
listen
to
such
an
idea
so
he
ended
by
entering
so
heartily
into
it
that
when
at
last
the
happy
day
and
hour
came
an
untoward
shower
had
not
the
least
effect
in
discouraging
him
there
was
a
great
bustle
about
the
little
homestead
on
that
eventful
tuesday
afternoon
two
very
steady
old
horses
were
saddled
one
for
me
and
the
other
for
one
of
the
new
chums
who
was
not
supposed
to
be
in
good
form
for
a
long
walk
owing
to
a
weak
knee
everything
which
we
thought
we
could
possibly
want
was
heaped
on
and
around
us
after
we
had
mounted
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
four
in
number
walked
and
we
reached
the
first
stage
of
our
expedition
in
about
an
hour
here
we
dismounted
as
the
horses
could
go
no
further
in
safety
the
first
thing
done
was
to
see
to
their
comfort
and
security
the
saddles
were
carefully
deposited
under
a
large
in
case
of
rain
and
the
long
tether
ropes
were
arranged
so
as
to
ensure
plenty
of
good
feed
and
water
for
both
horses
without
the
possibility
of
the
ropes
becoming
entangled
in
each
other
or
in
anything
else
then
came
a
time
of
great
excitement
and
laughing
and
talking
for
all
the
swags
had
to
be
packed
and
apportioned
for
the
very
long
and
steep
ascent
before
us
and
now
i
must
tell
you
exactly
what
we
took
up
a
pair
of
large
double
blankets
to
make
the
tent
of
that
was
one
swag
and
a
very
unwieldy
one
it
was
strapped
knapsack
fashion
with
straps
of
on
the
back
and
the
bearer
coat
and
waistcoat
fastened
on
the
top
of
the
whole
the
next
load
consisted
of
one
small
single
blanket
for
my
sole
use
inside
of
which
was
packed
a
cold
leg
of
lamb
i
carried
the
luncheon
basket
also
strapped
on
my
shoulders
filled
with
two
large
bottles
of
cream
some
tea
and
sugar
and
i
think
teaspoons
it
looked
a
very
insignificant
load
by
the
side
of
the
others
but
i
assure
you
i
found
it
frightfully
heavy
long
before
i
had
gone
up
the
hill
the
rest
distributed
among
them
a
couple
of
large
heavy
axes
a
small
coil
of
rope
some
bread
a
cake
tin
plates
and
pannikins
knives
and
forks
and
a
fine
concerning
this
pie
there
were
two
abominable
propositions
one
was
to
leave
it
behind
and
the
other
was
to
eat
it
then
and
there
both
of
these
suggestions
were
however
indignantly
rejected
i
must
not
forget
to
say
we
included
in
the
commissariat
department
two
bottles
of
whisky
and
a
tiny
bottle
of
essence
of
lemon
for
the
manufacture
of
toddy
we
never
see
a
real
lemon
except
two
or
three
times
a
year
when
a
ship
arrives
from
the
fiji
islands
and
then
they
are
sixpence
or
a
shilling
apiece
all
these
things
were
divided
into
two
large
heavy
swags
and
to
poor
f
was
assigned
the
heaviest
and
most
difficult
load
of
all
the
water
he
must
have
suffered
great
anxiety
all
the
way
for
if
any
accident
had
happened
to
his
load
he
would
have
had
to
go
back
again
to
refill
his
big
kettle
this
he
carried
in
his
hand
whilst
a
large
tin
vessel
with
a
screw
lid
over
its
mouth
was
strapped
on
his
back
also
full
of
water
but
he
was
particularly
charged
not
to
let
a
drop
escape
from
the
spout
of
the
kettle
and
i
may
mention
here
that
though
he
took
a
long
time
about
it
for
he
could
not
go
as
straight
up
the
hill
as
we
did
he
reached
the
top
with
the
kettle
full
to
the
brim
the
other
vessel
was
of
course
quite
safe
all
these
packings
and
repackings
and
the
comfortable
adjustment
of
the
swags
occupied
a
long
time
so
it
was
past
five
when
we
began
our
climb
and
six
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
getting
so
rapidly
dark
that
we
had
to
hurry
our
preparations
for
the
night
though
we
were
all
so
breathless
that
a
spell
do
you
know
that
means
would
have
been
most
acceptable
the
ascent
was
very
steep
and
there
were
no
to
guide
us
our
way
lay
through
thick
high
and
we
never
could
have
got
on
without
their
help
i
started
with
a
stick
but
soon
threw
it
aside
and
pulled
myself
up
by
the
flax
hand
over
hand
of
course
i
had
to
stop
every
now
and
then
to
rest
and
once
i
chose
the
same
where
three
young
wild
pigs
had
retired
for
the
night
having
first
made
themselves
the
most
beautiful
bed
of
tussock
grass
bitten
into
short
lengths
the
tussocks
are
very
much
scattered
here
so
it
must
have
been
an
afternoon
work
for
them
but
the
shepherds
say
these
wild
pigs
make
themselves
a
fresh
bed
every
night
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
pitch
the
tent
on
the
little
flat
at
the
very
top
of
the
hill
it
was
a
very
primitive
affair
two
of
the
thinnest
and
longest
pieces
of
totara
with
which
flagpole
is
strewed
we
used
for
poles
fastening
another
piece
lengthwise
to
these
upright
sticks
as
a
this
frame
was
then
covered
with
the
large
double
blanket
whose
ends
were
kept
down
on
the
ground
by
a
row
of
the
heaviest
stones
to
be
found
the
rope
we
had
brought
up
served
to
tie
the
poles
together
at
the
top
and
to
fasten
the
blanket
on
them
but
as
soon
as
the
tent
had
reached
this
stage
it
was
discovered
that
the
wind
blew
through
it
from
end
to
end
and
that
it
afforded
very
little
protection
we
also
found
it
much
colder
at
the
top
of
this
hill
than
in
our
valley
so
under
these
circumstances
it
became
necessary
to
appropriate
my
solitary
blanket
to
block
up
one
end
of
the
tent
and
make
it
more
comfortable
for
the
whole
party
it
was
very
little
shelter
before
this
was
done
the
next
step
was
to
collect
wood
for
a
fire
which
was
not
difficult
for
at
some
distant
time
the
whole
of
the
hill
must
have
been
covered
by
a
forest
of
totara
trees
it
has
apparently
been
destroyed
by
fire
for
the
huge
trunks
and
branches
which
still
strew
the
steep
sides
are
charred
and
half
burnt
it
is
a
beautiful
wood
with
a
strong
aromatic
odour
and
blazed
and
crackled
splendidly
in
the
clear
cool
evening
air
as
we
piled
up
a
huge
bonfire
and
put
the
kettle
on
to
boil
it
was
quite
dusk
by
this
time
so
the
gentlemen
worked
hard
at
collecting
a
great
supply
of
wood
as
the
night
promised
to
be
a
very
cold
one
whilst
i
remained
to
watch
the
kettle
full
of
that
precious
liquid
poor
f
had
carried
up
with
such
care
and
to
prevent
the
wekas
from
carrying
off
our
supper
which
i
had
arranged
just
inside
the
tent
in
this
latter
task
i
was
nobly
assisted
by
my
little
black
terrier
dick
of
whose
sad
fate
i
must
tell
you
later
by
eight
a
noble
pile
of
firewood
had
been
collected
and
we
were
very
tired
and
hungry
so
we
all
crept
inside
the
tent
which
did
not
afford
very
spacious
accommodation
and
began
our
supper
at
this
point
of
the
entertainment
everybody
voted
it
a
great
success
although
the
wind
was
slowly
rising
and
blowing
from
a
cold
point
and
our
did
not
afford
the
perfect
warmth
and
shelter
we
had
fondly
credited
it
with
the
gentlemen
began
to
button
up
their
coats
i
had
only
a
light
serge
jacket
on
so
i
coaxed
dick
to
sit
at
my
back
and
keep
it
warm
for
whilst
our
faces
were
roasted
by
the
huge
there
was
a
keen
and
icy
draught
behind
us
the
hot
tea
was
a
great
comfort
and
we
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
and
after
it
was
over
the
gentlemen
lit
their
pipes
and
i
told
them
a
story
presently
we
had
glees
but
by
ten
there
was
no
concealing
the
fact
that
we
were
all
very
sleepy
indeed
however
we
still
loudly
declared
that
camping
out
was
the
most
delightful
experiment
f
and
another
gentleman
that
kind
and
most
u
who
lives
with
us
went
outside
the
tent
armed
with
knives
and
cut
all
the
tussocks
they
could
feel
in
the
darkness
to
make
me
a
bed
after
the
fashion
of
the
pigs
they
brought
in
several
armfuls
and
the
warmest
corner
in
the
tent
was
heaped
with
them
i
had
my
for
a
pillow
and
announced
that
i
had
turned
in
and
was
very
comfortable
and
that
camping
out
was
charming
the
gentlemen
were
still
cheery
though
sleepy
and
the
last
thing
i
remember
was
seeing
preparations
being
made
for
what
a
frenchman
of
my
acquaintance
always
will
call
a
grogs
when
i
awoke
i
thought
i
must
have
slept
several
hours
though
the
fire
was
blazing
grandly
the
cold
was
intense
i
was
so
stiff
i
could
hardly
move
all
my
limbs
ached
dreadfully
and
my
sensations
altogether
were
new
and
very
disagreeable
i
sat
up
with
great
difficulty
and
many
groans
and
looked
round
two
figures
were
coiled
up
like
huge
dogs
near
me
two
more
moody
and
sulky
were
smoking
by
the
fire
with
their
knees
drawn
up
to
their
noses
and
their
hands
in
their
pockets
collars
well
up
round
their
throats
statues
of
cold
and
disgust
to
my
inquiries
about
the
hour
the
answer
given
in
tones
of
the
deepest
despondency
was
only
eleven
and
the
sun
does
rise
till
six
and
its
going
to
be
the
coldest
night
we
had
this
year
the
speaker
added
if
it
was
so
dark
that
we
break
our
necks
on
the
way
we
might
go
home
here
was
a
pretty
end
to
our
amusement
i
slowly
let
myself
down
again
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
but
that
relief
was
at
an
end
for
the
night
the
ground
seemed
to
grow
harder
every
moment
or
at
all
events
i
ached
more
and
the
wind
certainly
blew
higher
and
keener
dick
proved
himself
a
most
selfish
doggie
he
would
creep
round
to
leeward
of
whilst
i
wanted
him
to
let
me
get
leeward
of
him
but
he
would
not
consent
to
this
arrangement
whenever
i
heard
a
deeper
moan
or
sigh
than
usual
i
whispered
an
inquiry
as
to
the
hour
but
the
usual
reply
in
the
most
cynical
voice
was
oh
you
need
not
whisper
nobody
is
asleep
i
heard
one
plaintive
murmur
think
of
all
our
warm
beds
and
of
our
coming
up
here
from
choice
i
must
say
i
felt
dreadfully
ashamed
of
myself
for
my
plan
it
was
impossible
to
express
my
contrition
and
remorse
for
always
excepting
u
they
were
all
too
cross
to
be
spoken
to
it
certainly
was
a
weary
long
night
about
one
i
pretended
to
want
some
hot
tea
and
the
preparation
for
that
got
through
half
an
hour
and
it
warmed
us
a
little
but
everybody
still
was
deeply
dejected
not
to
say
morose
after
an
interval
of
only
two
hours
more
of
thorough
and
intense
wretchedness
we
had
a
grogs
but
there
was
no
attempt
at
conviviality
subdued
savageness
was
the
prevailing
state
of
mind
i
tried
to
infuse
a
little
hope
into
the
party
by
suggestions
of
a
speedy
termination
to
our
misery
but
my
own
private
opinion
was
that
we
should
all
be
laid
up
for
weeks
to
come
with
illness
i
allotted
to
myself
in
this
imaginary
distribution
of
ills
a
severe
rheumatic
fever
oh
how
i
ached
and
i
felt
as
if
i
never
could
be
warm
again
the
fire
was
no
use
except
to
afford
occupation
in
putting
on
wood
it
roasted
a
little
bit
of
you
at
a
time
and
that
bit
suffered
doubly
from
the
cold
when
it
was
obliged
to
take
its
share
of
exposure
to
the
wind
i
can
not
say
whether
the
proverb
is
true
of
other
nights
but
this
particular
night
certainly
was
both
darkest
and
coldest
just
before
dawn
at
last
to
our
deep
joy
and
after
many
false
alarms
we
really
all
agreed
that
there
was
a
faint
streak
of
grey
in
the
east
my
first
impulse
was
to
set
off
home
and
i
believe
i
tried
to
get
up
expressing
some
such
intention
but
f
recalled
me
to
myself
by
saying
in
great
surprise
are
you
not
going
to
stop
and
see
the
sun
rise
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
this
was
the
avowed
object
of
the
expedition
but
i
was
far
too
stiff
to
walk
a
yard
so
i
was
obliged
to
wait
to
see
what
effect
the
sunrise
would
have
on
my
frozen
limbs
for
i
could
not
think
of
any
higher
motive
presently
some
one
called
out
there
the
sea
and
so
it
was
as
distinct
as
though
it
were
not
fifty
miles
off
none
of
us
had
seen
it
since
we
landed
to
all
of
us
it
is
associated
with
the
idea
of
going
home
some
day
whilst
we
were
feasting
our
eyes
on
it
a
golden
line
seemed
drawn
on
its
horizon
it
spread
and
spread
and
as
all
the
water
became
flooded
with
a
light
and
glory
which
hardly
seemed
to
belong
to
this
world
the
blessed
sun
came
up
to
restore
us
all
to
life
and
warmth
again
in
a
moment
in
less
than
a
moment
all
our
little
privations
and
sufferings
vanished
as
if
they
had
never
existed
or
existed
only
to
be
laughed
at
who
could
think
of
their
ego
in
such
a
glorious
presence
and
with
such
a
panorama
before
them
i
did
not
know
which
side
to
turn
to
first
behind
me
rose
a
giant
forest
in
the
far
hills
to
the
west
a
deep
shadow
for
miles
till
the
dark
outline
of
the
pines
stood
out
against
the
dazzling
snow
of
the
mountains
behind
it
here
the
sky
was
still
sheltering
the
flying
night
and
the
white
outlines
looked
ghostly
against
the
dull
neutral
tints
though
every
peak
was
sharply
and
clearly
defined
then
i
turned
round
to
see
before
me
such
a
glow
of
light
and
beauty
for
an
immense
distance
i
could
see
the
vast
canterbury
plains
to
the
left
the
waimakiriri
river
flowing
in
many
streams
like
a
tangled
bunch
of
silver
ribbons
as
butler
calls
it
in
his
charming
book
on
new
zealand
down
to
the
sea
beyond
its
banks
the
sun
shone
on
the
windows
of
the
houses
at
oxford
thirty
miles
off
as
the
crow
would
fly
and
threw
its
dense
bush
into
strong
relief
against
the
yellow
plains
the
port
hills
took
the
most
lovely
lights
and
shadows
as
we
gazed
on
them
beyond
them
lay
the
hills
of
akaroa
beautiful
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
describe
christchurch
looked
quite
a
large
place
from
the
great
extent
of
ground
it
appeared
to
cover
we
looked
onto
the
south
there
was
a
slight
haze
over
the
great
ellesmere
lake
the
water
of
which
is
quite
fresh
though
only
separated
from
the
sea
by
a
slight
bar
of
sand
the
high
banks
of
the
rakaia
made
a
deep
dark
line
extending
right
back
into
the
mountains
and
beyond
it
we
could
see
the
rangitata
faintly
gleaming
in
the
distance
between
us
and
the
coast
were
green
patches
and
tiny
homesteads
but
still
few
and
far
between
close
under
our
feet
and
looking
like
a
thread
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
ran
the
selwyn
in
a
narrow
gorge
and
on
its
bank
stood
the
shepherd
hut
that
i
have
told
you
once
afforded
us
such
a
good
luncheon
it
looked
a
mere
toy
as
if
it
came
out
of
a
child
box
of
playthings
and
yet
so
snug
for
all
its
lonely
position
on
the
other
hand
lay
our
own
little
home
with
the
faint
wreath
of
smoke
stealing
up
through
the
calm
air
for
the
wind
had
dropped
at
sunrise
here
and
there
we
saw
strings
of
sheep
going
down
from
their
high
to
feed
on
the
sunny
slopes
and
in
the
warm
valleys
every
moment
added
to
our
delight
and
enjoyment
but
unfortunately
it
was
a
sort
of
happiness
which
one
can
neither
speak
of
at
the
time
nor
write
about
afterwards
silence
is
its
most
expressive
language
whilst
i
was
drinking
in
all
the
glory
and
beauty
before
me
some
of
the
others
had
been
busy
striking
the
tent
repacking
the
loads
very
much
lighter
without
the
provisions
and
we
had
one
more
excellent
cup
of
tea
before
abandoning
the
encampment
to
the
wekas
who
must
have
breakfasted
splendidly
that
morning
our
last
act
was
to
collect
all
the
stones
we
could
move
into
a
huge
cairn
which
was
built
round
a
tall
pole
of
totara
on
the
summit
of
this
we
tied
securely
with
flax
the
largest
and
strongest
and
then
after
one
look
round
to
the
west
now
as
glowing
and
bright
as
the
radiant
east
we
set
off
homewards
about
seven
but
it
was
long
before
we
reached
the
place
where
we
left
the
horses
for
the
gentlemen
began
rolling
huge
rocks
down
the
sides
of
the
hills
and
watching
them
crashing
and
thundering
into
the
valleys
sometimes
striking
another
rock
and
then
bounding
high
into
the
air
they
were
all
as
eager
and
excited
as
schoolboys
and
i
could
not
go
on
and
leave
them
lest
i
should
get
below
them
and
be
crushed
under
a
small
stone
of
twenty
tons
or
so
i
was
therefore
forced
to
keep
well
them
all
the
time
at
last
we
reached
the
spur
where
the
horses
were
tethered
and
loaded
them
and
arrived
quite
safely
at
home
just
in
time
for
baths
and
breakfast
i
was
amused
to
see
that
no
one
seemed
to
remember
or
allude
to
the
miseries
and
aches
of
that
long
cold
night
all
were
full
of
professions
of
enjoyment
but
i
noticed
that
the
day
was
unusually
quiet
the
gentlemen
preferred
a
bask
in
the
verandah
to
any
other
amusement
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
they
indulged
in
a
good
many
naps
letter
xviii
a
journey
down
south
waimate
may
in
one
of
my
early
letters
from
heathstock
i
told
you
that
the
hurunui
which
is
the
boundary
of
that
run
marks
the
extreme
north
of
the
province
of
canterbury
and
now
i
am
writing
to
you
from
the
extreme
south
i
hope
you
do
not
forget
to
reverse
in
your
own
mind
the
ordinary
ideas
of
heat
and
cold
as
connected
with
those
points
of
the
compass
the
distance
from
our
house
to
this
is
about
miles
and
we
actually
took
two
days
and
a
half
to
get
here
besides
into
these
miles
was
compressed
the
fatigue
of
a
dozen
english
railway
journeys
of
the
same
length
but
i
suppose
as
usual
you
will
not
be
satisfied
unless
i
begin
at
the
very
beginning
the
first
difficulty
was
to
reach
the
point
where
we
were
to
join
the
coach
on
the
great
south
road
it
was
less
than
thirty
miles
so
we
could
easily
have
ridden
the
distance
but
the
difficulty
was
to
get
our
clothes
all
that
way
they
could
not
be
carried
on
horseback
and
just
then
the
was
particularly
employed
besides
which
it
would
have
taken
three
days
to
come
and
go
rather
a
useless
expenditure
of
the
man
time
as
well
as
of
the
horses
legs
where
only
two
little
portmanteaus
were
concerned
fortunately
for
us
however
this
is
a
country
where
each
man
is
ready
and
willing
to
help
his
neighbour
without
any
inquiry
as
to
who
he
is
so
the
moment
our
dilemma
was
known
various
plans
were
suggested
for
our
assistance
of
which
this
was
the
one
selected
on
a
certain
bright
but
cold
wednesday
afternoon
f
and
i
and
our
modest
luggage
started
in
a
neighbour
trap
for
the
station
i
have
already
mentioned
on
the
horarata
where
h
and
i
stopped
on
our
way
to
lake
coleridge
it
is
on
the
plains
at
the
foot
of
a
low
range
of
downs
and
about
twelve
miles
from
us
you
can
not
imagine
a
more
charming
little
cottage
than
the
house
is
capable
of
holding
apparently
an
indefinite
number
of
people
and
with
owners
whose
hospitality
always
prompts
them
to
try
its
capabilities
to
the
utmost
a
creek
runs
near
the
house
and
on
its
banks
sloping
to
the
sun
lies
a
lovely
garden
as
trim
as
any
english
parterre
and
a
mass
of
fruit
and
flowers
nothing
can
be
more
picturesque
than
the
mixture
of
both
for
instance
on
the
wall
of
the
house
is
a
laden
every
autumn
with
rosy
fruit
and
jasmine
and
growing
luxuriantly
near
it
inside
all
is
bright
neatness
and
such
a
welcome
as
for
our
supper
on
this
particular
day
it
comprised
every
dainty
you
can
imagine
and
made
me
think
of
my
housekeeping
with
shame
and
confusion
of
face
we
had
a
very
merry
evening
with
round
games
but
there
was
a
strong
prejudice
in
favour
of
going
to
bed
early
as
we
all
had
to
be
up
by
three
and
so
we
were
to
find
a
delicious
breakfast
prepared
for
us
which
our
kind
hostess
was
quite
disappointed
to
see
we
could
not
eat
much
of
coffee
and
toast
was
all
i
could
manage
at
that
hour
we
started
in
the
dark
and
the
first
thing
we
had
to
cross
was
a
dry
in
which
one
of
the
horses
lay
deliberately
down
and
refused
to
move
this
eccentricity
delayed
us
very
much
but
we
got
him
into
a
better
frame
of
mind
and
accomplished
our
early
drive
of
sixteen
miles
in
safety
reaching
the
or
inn
where
the
coach
from
christchurch
to
timaru
changes
horses
for
its
first
stage
by
six
there
we
had
a
good
breakfast
and
were
in
great
form
by
the
time
the
coach
was
ready
to
start
these
conveyances
have
a
celebrity
as
coaches
both
in
america
and
australia
where
they
are
invariably
the
pioneers
of
all
wheeled
vehicles
being
better
adapted
to
travel
on
a
bad
road
or
no
road
at
all
than
any
other
trap
they
are
both
strong
and
light
with
leathern
springs
and
a
powerful
break
but
i
can
not
conscientiously
say
they
are
at
all
handsome
carriages
indeed
i
think
them
extremely
ugly
and
not
very
comfortable
except
on
the
next
the
driver
fortunately
this
is
made
to
hold
three
so
f
and
i
scrambled
up
and
off
we
started
with
four
good
strong
horses
bearing
less
harness
about
them
than
any
quadrupeds
i
ever
saw
a
small
collar
slender
traces
and
very
thin
reins
comprised
all
their
accoutrements
the
first
half
of
the
journey
was
slow
but
there
was
no
jolting
the
road
was
level
though
it
had
not
been
made
at
all
only
the
tussocks
removed
from
it
but
it
was
naturally
good
a
great
exception
to
new
zealand
roads
the
driver
was
a
steady
respectable
man
very
intelligent
and
when
f
could
make
him
talk
of
his
experiences
in
australia
in
the
early
coaching
days
i
was
much
interested
we
crossed
the
rakaia
and
the
rangitata
in
and
stopped
on
the
banks
of
the
ashburton
to
dine
about
one
having
changed
horses
twice
since
we
started
from
gigg
as
our
place
of
junction
was
elegantly
called
here
all
my
troubles
began
when
we
came
out
of
the
little
inn
much
comforted
and
refreshed
by
a
good
dinner
i
found
to
my
regret
that
we
were
to
change
drivers
as
well
as
horses
and
that
a
very
popular
and
well
known
individual
was
to
be
the
new
coachman
as
our
former
driver
very
politely
assisted
me
to
clamber
up
on
the
he
recommended
f
to
sit
on
the
outside
part
of
the
seat
and
to
put
me
next
the
driver
where
he
added
the
lady
wo
be
so
likely
to
tumble
out
as
i
had
shown
no
disposition
to
fall
off
the
coach
hitherto
i
was
much
astonished
by
this
precaution
but
said
nothing
so
he
was
emboldened
to
whisper
after
looking
round
furtively
and
you
jest
take
and
do
be
afraid
marm
handles
the
ribbings
jest
as
well
when
he
had
a
drop
too
much
as
when
he
sober
which
ai
often
however
this
last
caution
alarmed
me
extremely
the
horses
were
not
yet
put
in
nor
the
driver
put
so
i
begged
f
to
get
down
and
see
if
i
could
not
go
inside
but
after
a
hasty
survey
he
said
it
was
quite
impossible
men
smoking
children
crying
and
in
addition
a
policeman
with
a
lunatic
in
his
charge
made
the
inside
worse
than
the
outside
especially
in
point
of
atmosphere
so
he
repeated
the
substance
of
our
farewell
speech
and
when
i
saw
our
new
charioteer
emerge
at
last
from
the
bar
looking
only
very
jovial
and
tolerably
steady
as
to
gait
i
thought
perhaps
my
panic
was
premature
but
oh
what
a
time
i
had
of
it
for
nine
hours
afterwards
the
moment
the
grooms
let
go
the
horses
heads
he
stood
up
on
his
seat
shook
the
reins
flourished
his
long
whip
and
with
one
wild
yell
from
him
we
dashed
down
a
steep
cutting
into
the
ashburton
the
water
flew
in
spray
far
over
our
heads
and
the
plunge
wetted
me
as
effectually
as
if
i
had
fallen
into
the
river
i
expected
the
front
part
of
the
coach
to
part
from
the
back
on
account
of
the
enormous
strain
caused
by
dragging
it
over
the
boulders
we
lurched
like
a
boat
in
a
heavy
sea
the
insides
screamed
jim
that
was
the
driver
name
swore
and
yelled
the
horses
reared
and
plunged
all
this
time
i
was
holding
on
like
grim
death
to
a
light
iron
railing
above
my
head
and
one
glance
to
my
left
showed
me
f
thrown
off
the
very
small
portion
of
cushion
which
fell
to
his
share
and
clinging
desperately
to
a
rude
sort
of
i
speculated
for
an
instant
whether
this
would
break
and
if
so
what
would
become
of
him
but
it
took
all
my
ideas
to
keep
myself
from
being
jerked
off
among
the
horses
heels
we
dashed
through
the
river
jim
gathered
up
the
reins
and
with
a
different
set
of
oaths
swore
he
would
punish
the
horses
for
jibbing
in
the
water
and
he
did
punish
them
he
put
the
break
hard
down
for
some
way
flogged
them
with
all
his
strength
dancing
about
the
and
yelling
like
a
madman
every
now
and
then
in
the
course
of
his
bounds
from
place
to
place
he
would
come
plump
down
on
my
lap
but
i
was
too
much
frightened
to
remonstrate
indeed
we
were
going
at
such
a
pace
against
the
wind
i
had
very
little
breath
to
spare
we
got
over
the
first
stage
of
twenty
miles
at
this
rate
very
quickly
as
you
may
imagine
but
unfortunately
there
was
an
close
to
the
stables
and
jim
had
a
good
deal
more
refreshment
strange
to
say
this
did
not
make
him
any
wilder
in
manner
that
he
could
not
be
but
after
we
started
again
he
became
extremely
friendly
with
me
addressing
me
invariably
as
my
dear
and
offering
to
treat
me
at
every
inn
from
that
to
timaru
i
declined
as
briefly
as
i
could
whereupon
he
became
extremely
angry
at
my
doubting
his
pecuniary
resources
apparently
for
holding
the
reins
carelessly
with
one
hand
though
we
were
still
tearing
recklessly
along
he
searched
his
pockets
with
the
other
hand
and
produced
from
them
a
quantity
of
greasy
dirty
notes
all
of
which
he
laid
on
my
lap
saying
there
and
there
and
there
if
you
think
i
a
beggar
i
fully
expected
them
to
blow
away
for
i
could
not
spare
a
hand
to
hold
them
but
i
watched
my
opportunity
when
he
was
punishing
the
unfortunate
fresh
team
and
pounced
on
them
thrusting
the
dirty
heap
back
into
his
pocket
at
the
next
stage
a
very
tidy
woman
came
out
with
a
rather
large
bundle
containing
fresh
linen
she
said
for
her
son
who
was
ill
in
the
hospital
at
timaru
she
booked
this
and
paid
her
for
its
carriage
entreating
the
drunken
wretch
to
see
that
it
reached
her
son
that
night
he
wildly
promised
he
should
have
it
in
and
we
set
off
as
if
he
meant
to
keep
his
word
though
we
were
some
forty
miles
off
yet
but
he
soon
changed
his
mind
and
took
a
hatred
to
the
parcel
saying
it
would
sink
the
ship
and
finally
tried
to
kick
it
over
the
i
seized
it
at
the
risk
of
losing
my
balance
and
hugged
it
tight
all
the
way
to
timaru
carrying
it
off
to
the
hotel
where
i
induced
a
waiter
to
take
it
up
to
the
hospital
after
we
had
changed
horses
for
the
last
time
and
i
was
comforting
myself
by
the
reflection
that
the
journey
was
nearly
over
we
heard
shouts
and
screams
from
the
inside
passengers
f
persuaded
jim
with
much
trouble
to
pull
up
and
jumped
down
to
see
what
was
the
matter
a
strong
smell
of
burning
and
a
good
deal
of
smoke
arose
from
inside
the
coach
caused
by
the
lunatic
having
taken
off
both
his
boots
and
lighted
a
fire
in
them
it
was
getting
dark
and
chilly
the
other
passengers
including
the
policeman
had
dozed
off
and
the
madman
thought
that
as
his
feet
were
very
cold
he
would
try
and
warm
them
a
bit
so
he
collected
all
the
newspapers
with
which
his
had
been
solacing
the
tedium
of
their
journey
tore
them
up
into
shreds
with
the
addition
of
the
contents
of
a
poor
woman
bundle
and
made
quite
a
cheerful
blaze
out
of
these
materials
it
was
some
time
before
the
terrified
women
could
be
induced
to
get
into
the
coach
again
and
it
was
only
by
jims
asseverations
couched
in
the
strongest
language
that
if
they
were
not
all
aboard
in
half
a
minute
he
would
drive
on
and
leave
them
in
the
middle
of
the
plains
that
they
were
persuaded
to
clamber
in
to
their
places
once
more
how
thankful
i
was
when
we
saw
the
lights
of
timaru
i
was
stunned
and
bewildered
tired
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
describe
and
black
and
blue
all
over
from
being
jolted
about
the
road
had
been
an
excellent
one
all
the
way
level
and
wide
with
by
its
side
we
shaved
these
very
closely
often
enough
but
certainly
amid
all
his
tipsiness
jim
bore
out
his
predecessors
remark
whenever
we
came
to
a
little
dip
in
the
road
or
a
sharp
turn
as
we
were
nearing
timaru
he
would
get
the
horses
under
control
as
if
by
magic
and
take
us
over
as
safely
as
the
soberest
driver
could
have
done
the
moment
the
obstacle
was
passed
off
we
were
again
like
a
whirlwind
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
hear
that
upsets
and
accidents
were
common
on
the
road
and
that
the
horses
lasted
but
a
very
short
time
we
found
our
host
had
driven
in
from
his
station
miles
distant
from
timaru
to
meet
us
and
had
ordered
nice
rooms
and
a
good
dinner
so
the
next
morning
i
was
quite
rested
and
ready
to
laugh
over
my
miseries
of
the
day
before
nothing
could
be
a
greater
contrast
than
this
day
journeying
to
yesterday
a
low
comfortable
phaeton
and
one
of
the
most
agreeable
companions
in
the
world
to
drive
us
beautiful
scenery
and
a
nice
luncheon
at
which
meal
f
ate
something
like
half
a
hundred
the
last
part
of
the
road
for
a
dozen
miles
or
so
was
rather
rough
we
had
to
cross
a
little
river
the
waio
every
few
hundred
yards
and
a
new
zealand
river
has
so
much
shingle
about
it
the
water
can
never
quite
make
up
its
mind
where
it
would
like
to
go
and
has
channels
ready
to
choose
from
and
then
in
a
heavy
fresh
the
chances
are
it
will
select
and
make
quite
a
different
course
after
all
this
is
late
autumn
with
us
remember
so
the
evenings
close
in
early
and
are
very
cold
indeed
it
was
quite
dark
when
we
reached
the
house
and
the
blazing
fires
in
every
room
were
most
welcome
the
house
is
very
unlike
the
conventional
station
pattern
being
built
of
stone
large
very
well
arranged
and
the
perfection
of
comfort
inside
there
is
no
hostess
at
present
three
bachelor
brothers
do
the
honours
and
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
do
them
most
efficiently
our
visit
has
lasted
three
weeks
already
and
we
really
must
bring
it
to
a
termination
soon
the
weather
has
been
beautiful
and
we
have
made
many
delightful
excursions
all
on
horseback
to
neighbouring
stations
to
a
fine
bush
where
we
had
a
picnic
or
to
some
point
of
view
i
can
truly
say
i
have
enjoyed
every
moment
of
the
time
indoors
as
well
as
out
i
was
the
only
lady
and
was
petted
and
made
much
of
to
my
heart
content
there
were
several
other
guests
and
they
were
all
nice
and
amusing
one
wet
day
we
had
and
only
one
i
must
tell
you
an
incident
of
it
to
show
you
what
babies
men
can
be
at
the
antipodes
we
worked
hard
all
the
morning
at
acrostics
and
after
my
five
tea
i
went
upstairs
to
a
charming
little
boudoir
prepared
for
me
to
rest
and
read
in
a
short
time
i
heard
something
like
music
and
stamping
and
though
i
was
i
stole
softly
down
to
see
what
was
going
on
when
i
opened
the
door
of
the
general
a
most
unusual
sight
presented
itself
eight
bearded
men
none
of
them
very
young
were
dancing
a
set
of
quadrilles
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
decorum
to
the
tunes
played
by
a
large
which
was
going
at
the
most
prodigious
pace
consequently
the
dancers
were
flying
through
the
figures
in
silence
and
breathless
haste
they
could
not
stop
or
speak
when
i
came
in
and
seemed
quite
surprised
at
my
laughing
at
them
but
you
have
no
idea
how
ridiculous
they
looked
especially
as
their
gravity
and
earnestness
were
profound
this
is
one
of
the
very
few
stations
where
pheasants
have
been
introduced
but
then
every
arrangement
has
been
made
for
their
comfort
and
a
beautiful
house
and
yard
built
for
their
reception
on
a
flat
just
beneath
the
high
terrace
on
which
the
house
stands
more
than
a
hundred
young
birds
were
turned
out
last
spring
and
there
will
probably
be
three
times
that
number
at
the
end
of
this
year
we
actually
had
pheasant
twice
at
dinner
the
first
and
probably
the
last
time
we
shall
taste
game
in
new
zealand
there
is
a
good
deal
of
thick
scrub
in
the
clefts
of
the
and
this
affords
excellent
shelter
for
the
young
their
greatest
enemies
are
the
hawks
and
every
variety
of
trap
and
cunning
device
for
the
destruction
of
these
latter
are
in
use
but
as
yet
without
doing
much
execution
among
them
they
are
so
wonderfully
clever
and
discerning
letter
xix
a
christening
the
fate
of
dick
broomielaw
june
we
reached
home
quite
safely
the
first
week
of
this
month
and
i
immediately
set
to
work
to
prepare
for
the
visit
we
met
him
at
a
friend
house
one
day
just
as
we
were
starting
homewards
and
something
led
to
my
telling
him
about
the
destitute
spiritual
condition
of
my
favourite
nest
of
cockatoos
with
his
usual
energy
as
well
as
goodness
he
immediately
volunteered
to
come
up
to
our
little
place
hold
a
service
and
christen
all
the
children
we
were
only
too
thankful
to
accept
such
an
offer
as
we
well
knew
what
an
inducement
it
would
be
to
the
people
who
would
take
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
come
from
far
and
near
to
hear
our
dear
bishop
who
is
universally
beloved
and
respected
for
a
week
beforehand
the
house
smelt
all
day
long
like
a
baker
shop
about
noon
on
sunday
for
pies
tarts
cakes
were
perpetually
being
drawn
from
the
oven
i
borrowed
every
for
miles
round
and
as
on
another
occasion
i
have
mentioned
plenty
of
good
things
which
our
own
resources
could
not
furnish
forth
came
pouring
in
on
all
sides
with
offers
to
help
f
and
i
scoured
the
country
for
thirty
miles
round
to
invite
everybody
to
come
over
to
us
that
sunday
and
i
think
i
may
truly
say
everybody
came
when
i
rode
over
to
my
nest
and
made
the
announcement
of
the
bishop
visit
the
people
were
very
much
delighted
but
a
great
difficulty
arose
from
the
sudden
demand
for
white
frocks
for
all
the
babies
and
older
children
i
rashly
promised
each
child
should
find
a
clean
white
garment
awaiting
it
on
its
arrival
at
my
house
and
took
away
a
memorandum
of
all
the
different
ages
and
sizes
the
order
never
could
have
been
accomplished
without
the
aid
of
my
i
had
a
few
little
frocks
by
me
as
patterns
and
cut
up
some
very
smart
white
embroidered
petticoats
which
were
quite
useless
to
me
to
make
into
little
skirts
in
spite
of
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
kitchen
my
maids
found
time
to
get
these
up
most
beautifully
and
by
the
saturday
night
the
little
bed
in
the
spare
room
was
a
heap
of
snowy
small
garments
with
a
name
written
on
paper
and
pinned
to
each
the
bishop
also
arrived
quite
safely
late
that
evening
having
driven
himself
up
from
christchurch
in
a
little
gig
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
imagine
a
more
beautiful
winter
morning
than
dawned
on
us
that
sunday
a
sharp
frost
only
made
the
air
deliciously
crisp
for
the
sun
shone
so
brightly
that
by
nine
the
light
film
of
ice
over
the
ponds
had
disappeared
and
i
found
the
bishop
basking
in
the
verandah
when
i
came
out
to
breakfast
instead
of
sitting
over
the
blazing
in
the
we
got
our
meal
finished
as
quickly
as
possible
and
then
f
and
u
set
to
work
to
fill
the
verandah
with
forms
extemporised
out
of
empty
boxes
placed
at
each
end
and
planks
laid
across
them
every
red
blanket
in
the
house
was
pressed
into
service
to
cover
these
rough
devices
and
the
effect
at
last
was
quite
tidy
by
eleven
the
drays
began
to
arrive
in
almost
a
continual
stream
as
each
came
up
its
occupants
were
taken
into
the
kitchen
and
given
as
much
as
they
could
eat
of
cold
pies
made
of
either
pork
or
mutton
bread
and
hot
potatoes
and
tea
as
for
teapots
they
were
discarded
and
the
tea
was
made
in
huge
kettles
whilst
the
milk
stood
in
buckets
into
which
quart
jugs
were
dipped
every
five
minutes
i
took
care
of
all
the
women
and
children
whilst
f
and
u
looked
after
the
men
showed
them
where
to
put
the
horses
etc
all
this
time
several
gentlemen
and
two
or
three
ladies
had
arrived
but
there
was
no
one
to
attend
to
them
so
they
all
very
kindly
came
out
and
helped
we
insisted
on
the
bishop
keeping
quiet
in
the
or
he
would
have
worked
as
hard
as
any
one
i
never
could
have
got
the
children
into
their
white
frocks
by
two
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
help
of
the
other
ladies
but
at
last
they
were
all
dressed
and
the
congregation
not
much
under
a
hundred
people
fed
and
arranged
in
their
places
there
had
been
a
difficulty
about
finding
sufficient
godmothers
and
godfathers
so
f
and
i
were
sponsors
for
every
child
and
each
parent
wished
me
to
hand
the
child
to
the
bishop
but
i
could
not
lift
up
many
of
the
bigger
ones
and
they
roared
piteously
when
i
touched
their
hands
i
felt
it
quite
a
beautiful
and
thrilling
scene
the
sunburnt
faces
all
around
the
chubby
pretty
little
group
of
children
every
one
well
fed
and
comfortably
clothed
the
dogs
lying
at
their
masters
feet
the
bright
winter
sunshine
and
dazzling
sky
and
our
dear
bishops
commanding
figure
and
clear
penetrating
voice
he
gave
us
a
most
excellent
sermon
short
and
simple
but
so
perfectly
appropriate
and
after
the
service
was
over
he
went
about
talking
to
all
the
various
groups
such
nice
helpful
words
the
truest
kindness
was
now
to
speed
the
parting
guest
so
each
dray
load
beginning
with
those
whose
homes
were
the
most
distant
was
collected
they
were
first
taken
into
the
kitchen
and
given
a
good
meal
of
hot
tea
cake
and
bread
and
butter
for
many
had
four
hours
jolting
before
them
the
red
blankets
were
again
called
into
requisition
to
act
as
wraps
besides
every
cloak
and
shawl
i
possessed
for
the
moment
the
sun
sunk
which
would
be
about
four
the
cold
was
sure
to
become
intense
we
lived
that
day
in
the
most
scrambling
fashion
ourselves
there
was
plenty
of
cold
meat
on
the
table
and
piles
of
plates
and
whenever
any
of
the
party
were
hungry
they
went
and
helped
themselves
as
my
two
servants
were
entirely
occupied
with
looking
after
the
comfort
of
the
congregation
it
was
such
a
treat
to
them
to
have
even
for
a
few
hours
the
society
of
other
women
they
have
only
one
female
neighbour
and
she
is
generally
too
busy
to
see
much
of
them
besides
which
i
think
the
real
reason
of
the
want
of
intimacy
is
that
m
is
a
very
superior
person
and
when
she
comes
up
i
generally
like
to
have
a
chat
with
her
myself
it
does
me
good
to
see
her
bonny
scotch
face
and
hear
the
sweet
kindly
tongue
besides
which
she
is
my
great
instructress
in
the
mysteries
of
knitting
socks
and
stockings
spinning
making
really
good
butter
not
an
easy
thing
madam
and
in
all
sorts
of
useful
accomplishments
her
husband
is
the
head
shepherd
on
the
next
station
they
are
both
very
fond
of
reading
and
it
was
quite
pretty
to
see
the
delight
they
took
in
the
queen
book
about
the
highlands
to
return
however
to
that
sunday
we
were
all
dreadfully
tired
by
the
time
the
last
guest
had
departed
but
we
had
a
delightfully
quiet
evening
and
a
long
talk
with
the
bishop
about
our
favourite
scheme
of
the
church
and
school
among
the
cockatoos
and
we
may
feel
certain
of
his
hearty
cooperation
in
any
feasible
plan
for
carrying
it
out
the
next
morning
much
to
our
regret
the
bishop
left
us
for
christchurch
but
he
had
to
hold
a
confirmation
service
there
and
could
not
give
us
even
a
few
more
hours
we
were
so
very
fortunate
in
our
weather
the
following
sunday
was
a
pouring
wet
day
and
we
have
had
wind
and
rain
almost
ever
since
it
is
unusually
wet
so
i
have
nothing
more
to
tell
you
of
our
doings
which
must
seem
very
eccentric
to
you
by
the
way
but
i
assure
you
i
enjoy
the
gipsy
unconventional
life
immensely
you
must
not
be
critical
about
a
jumble
of
subjects
if
i
record
poor
dick
tragical
fate
here
it
will
serve
to
fill
up
my
letter
and
if
ever
you
have
mourned
for
a
pet
dog
you
will
sympathise
with
me
i
must
first
explain
to
you
that
on
a
sheep
station
strange
dogs
are
regarded
with
a
most
unfriendly
eye
by
both
master
and
shepherds
there
are
the
proper
colleys
generally
each
shepherd
has
two
but
no
other
dogs
are
allowed
and
i
had
great
trouble
to
coax
f
to
allow
me
to
accept
two
one
is
a
beautiful
jet
black
brisk
by
name
but
his
character
is
stainless
in
the
matter
of
sheep
and
though
very
handsome
he
is
only
an
amiable
idiot
his
one
amusement
being
to
chase
a
weka
which
he
never
catches
the
other
dog
was
alas
dick
a
small
terrier
very
well
bred
and
full
of
tricks
and
play
we
never
even
suspected
him
of
any
wickedness
but
as
it
turned
out
he
must
have
been
a
hardened
offender
a
few
weeks
after
he
came
to
us
when
the
lambing
season
was
at
its
height
and
the
low
sunny
hills
near
the
house
were
covered
with
hundreds
of
the
pretty
little
white
creatures
f
used
sometimes
to
come
and
ask
me
where
dick
was
and
strange
to
say
dick
constantly
did
not
answer
to
my
call
an
evening
or
two
later
just
as
we
were
starting
for
our
walk
dick
appeared
in
a
great
hurry
from
the
back
of
the
stable
f
went
up
immediately
to
him
and
stooped
down
to
examine
his
mouth
calling
me
to
see
oh
horror
it
was
all
covered
with
blood
and
wool
i
pleaded
all
sorts
of
extenuating
circumstances
but
f
said
with
judicial
sternness
this
can
not
be
allowed
dick
was
more
fascinating
than
usual
never
looking
at
a
sheep
whilst
we
were
out
walking
with
him
and
behaving
in
the
most
exemplary
manner
f
watched
him
all
the
next
day
and
at
last
caught
him
in
the
act
of
killing
a
lamb
a
little
way
from
the
house
the
culprit
was
brought
to
me
hanging
his
tail
with
the
most
guilty
air
and
f
said
i
ought
to
shoot
him
but
if
you
like
i
will
try
if
a
beating
can
cure
him
but
it
must
be
a
tremendous
one
i
was
obliged
to
accept
this
alternative
and
retreated
where
i
could
not
hear
howls
under
the
lash
over
the
body
of
his
victim
a
few
hours
after
i
went
to
the
spot
lifted
dick
up
and
carried
him
into
my
room
to
nurse
him
for
he
could
not
move
he
had
been
beaten
so
severely
for
two
whole
days
he
lay
on
the
soft
mat
i
gave
him
only
able
to
lap
a
little
warm
milk
on
the
third
morning
he
tried
to
get
up
and
crawled
into
the
verandah
i
followed
to
watch
him
imagine
my
dismay
at
seeing
him
limp
to
the
place
where
the
body
of
his
last
victim
lay
and
deliberately
begin
tearing
it
to
pieces
i
followed
him
with
my
little
horsewhip
and
gave
him
a
slight
beating
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
hit
him
very
hard
i
carefully
concealed
this
incident
from
f
and
for
some
days
i
never
let
dick
out
of
my
sight
for
a
moment
but
early
one
fine
morning
a
knock
came
to
our
door
and
a
voice
said
please
sir
come
and
see
what
the
matter
with
the
sheep
there
a
large
mob
of
them
at
the
back
of
the
house
being
driven
like
oh
my
prophetic
soul
i
felt
it
was
dick
whilst
f
was
huddling
on
some
clothes
i
implored
him
to
temper
justice
with
mercy
but
never
a
word
did
he
say
and
sternly
took
his
gun
in
his
hand
and
went
out
i
buried
my
head
in
the
pillows
but
for
all
my
precautions
i
heard
the
report
of
a
shot
in
the
clear
morning
air
and
the
echo
ringing
back
from
all
the
hills
five
minutes
afterwards
f
came
in
with
a
little
blue
collar
in
his
hand
and
said
briefly
he
has
worried
more
than
a
dozen
lambs
this
morning
alone
what
could
i
say
f
only
attempt
at
consolation
was
he
died
instantly
i
shot
him
through
the
head
but
for
many
days
afterwards
i
felt
quite
lonely
and
sad
without
my
poor
little
pet
yet
what
could
have
been
done
no
one
would
have
accepted
him
as
a
present
and
it
flashed
on
me
afterwards
that
perhaps
this
vice
of
his
was
the
reason
of
dick
former
owner
being
so
anxious
to
give
him
to
me
i
have
had
two
offers
of
successors
to
dick
since
but
i
shall
never
have
another
dog
on
a
sheep
station
unless
i
know
what
dickens
little
dressmaker
calls
its
tricks
and
its
manners
letter
xx
the
new
zealand
snowstorm
of
broomielaw
august
i
have
had
my
first
experience
of
real
hardships
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
yes
we
have
all
had
to
endure
positive
hunger
and
cold
and
what
i
found
much
harder
to
bear
great
anxiety
of
mind
i
think
i
mentioned
that
the
weather
towards
the
end
of
july
had
been
unusually
disagreeable
but
not
very
cold
this
wet
fortnight
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
our
sufferings
afterwards
for
it
came
exactly
at
the
time
we
were
accustomed
to
send
our
dray
down
to
christchurch
for
supplies
of
flour
and
groceries
and
to
lay
in
a
good
stock
of
coals
for
the
winter
these
latter
had
been
ordered
and
were
expected
every
day
just
the
last
few
days
of
july
the
weather
cleared
up
and
became
like
our
usual
most
beautiful
winter
climate
so
after
waiting
a
day
or
two
to
allow
the
roads
to
dry
a
little
the
dray
was
despatched
to
town
bearing
a
long
list
of
orders
and
with
many
injunctions
to
the
driver
to
return
as
quickly
as
possible
for
all
the
stores
were
at
the
lowest
ebb
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
these
domestic
details
in
order
that
you
may
understand
the
reason
of
our
privations
i
acknowledge
humbly
that
it
was
not
good
management
but
sometimes
accidents
occur
it
was
also
necessary
for
f
to
make
a
journey
to
christchurch
on
business
and
as
he
probably
would
be
detained
there
for
nearly
a
week
it
was
arranged
that
one
of
the
young
gentlemen
from
rockwood
should
ride
over
and
escort
me
back
there
to
remain
during
f
absence
i
am
going
to
give
you
all
the
exact
dates
for
this
will
be
a
matter
of
history
during
the
present
generation
at
all
events
there
is
no
tradition
among
the
maoris
of
such
a
severe
one
ever
having
occurred
and
what
made
it
more
fatal
in
its
financial
consequences
to
every
one
was
that
the
lambing
season
had
only
just
commenced
or
terminated
on
most
of
the
runs
only
a
few
days
before
he
left
f
had
taken
me
for
a
ride
in
the
sheltered
valleys
that
he
might
see
the
state
of
the
lambs
and
pronounced
it
most
satisfactory
thousands
of
the
pretty
little
creatures
were
skipping
about
by
their
mothers
side
i
find
by
my
diary
july
marked
as
the
beginning
of
a
f
had
arranged
to
start
that
morning
and
as
his
business
was
urgent
he
did
not
like
to
delay
his
departure
though
the
day
was
most
unpromising
a
steady
fine
drizzle
and
raw
atmosphere
however
we
hurried
breakfast
and
he
set
off
determining
to
push
on
to
town
as
quickly
as
possible
i
never
spent
such
a
dismal
day
in
my
life
my
mind
was
disturbed
by
secret
anxieties
about
the
possibility
of
the
dray
being
detained
by
wet
weather
and
there
was
such
an
extraordinary
weight
in
the
air
the
dense
mist
seemed
pressing
everything
down
to
the
ground
however
i
drew
the
sofa
to
the
fire
made
up
a
good
blaze
the
last
i
saw
for
some
time
and
prepared
to
pass
a
lazy
day
with
a
book
but
i
felt
so
restless
and
miserable
i
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
me
i
wandered
from
window
to
window
and
still
the
same
unusual
sight
met
my
eyes
a
long
procession
of
ewes
and
lambs
all
travelling
steadily
down
from
the
hills
towards
the
large
flat
in
front
of
the
house
the
bleating
was
incessant
and
added
to
the
intense
melancholy
of
the
whole
affair
when
u
came
in
to
dinner
at
one
he
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
most
unusual
weather
and
said
that
on
the
other
ranges
the
sheep
were
drifting
before
the
cold
mist
and
rain
just
in
the
same
way
our
only
anxiety
arose
from
the
certainty
that
the
dray
would
be
delayed
at
least
a
day
and
perhaps
two
this
was
a
dreadful
idea
for
some
time
past
we
had
been
economising
our
resources
to
make
them
last
and
we
knew
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
at
the
nor
at
our
nearest
neighbour
for
they
had
sent
to
borrow
tea
and
sugar
from
us
just
at
dusk
that
evening
two
gentlemen
rode
up
not
knowing
f
was
from
home
and
asked
if
they
might
remain
for
the
night
i
knew
them
both
very
well
in
fact
one
was
our
cousin
t
and
the
other
an
old
friend
so
they
put
up
their
horses
and
housed
their
dogs
for
each
had
a
valuable
with
him
in
a
barrel
full
of
clean
straw
and
we
all
tried
to
spend
a
cheerful
evening
but
everybody
confessed
to
the
same
extraordinary
depression
of
spirits
that
i
felt
when
i
awoke
the
next
morning
i
was
not
much
surprised
to
see
the
snow
falling
thick
and
fast
no
sheep
were
now
visible
there
was
a
great
silence
and
the
oppression
in
the
atmosphere
had
if
possible
increased
we
had
a
very
poor
breakfast
no
porridge
very
little
mutton
for
in
expectation
of
the
house
being
nearly
empty
the
shepherd
had
not
brought
any
over
the
preceding
day
and
weak
tea
coffee
and
cocoa
all
finished
and
about
an
ounce
of
tea
in
the
chest
i
do
know
how
the
gentlemen
amused
themselves
that
day
i
believe
they
smoked
a
good
deal
i
could
only
afford
a
small
fire
in
the
over
which
i
shivered
the
snow
continued
to
fall
in
dense
fine
clouds
quite
unlike
any
snow
i
ever
saw
before
and
towards
night
i
fancied
the
garden
fence
was
becoming
very
much
dwarfed
still
the
consolation
was
oh
it
wo
last
new
zealand
snow
never
does
however
on
wednesday
morning
things
began
to
look
very
serious
indeed
the
snow
covered
the
ground
to
a
depth
of
four
feet
in
the
shallowest
places
and
still
continued
to
fall
steadily
the
cows
we
knew
be
in
the
paddock
were
not
to
be
seen
anywhere
the
and
which
stood
towards
the
weather
quarter
had
entirely
disappeared
every
scrap
of
wood
and
several
logs
were
lying
about
at
the
back
was
quite
covered
up
both
the
verandahs
were
impassable
in
one
the
snow
was
six
feet
deep
and
the
only
door
which
could
be
opened
was
the
door
as
that
opened
inwards
but
here
the
snow
was
over
the
roof
so
it
took
a
good
deal
of
work
with
the
for
no
spades
could
be
found
to
dig
out
a
passage
indoors
we
were
approaching
our
last
mouthful
very
rapidly
the
tea
at
breakfast
was
merely
coloured
hot
water
and
we
had
some
picnic
biscuits
with
it
for
dinner
we
had
the
last
tin
of
sardines
the
last
pot
of
apricot
jam
and
a
tin
of
ratifia
biscuits
a
most
extraordinary
mixture
i
admit
but
there
was
nothing
else
there
were
six
people
to
be
fed
every
day
and
nothing
to
feed
them
with
thursday
breakfast
was
a
discovered
crust
of
dry
bread
very
stale
and
our
dinner
that
day
was
rice
and
salt
the
last
rice
in
the
the
snow
still
never
ceased
falling
and
only
one
window
in
the
house
afforded
us
any
light
every
box
was
broken
up
and
used
for
fuel
the
gentlemen
used
to
go
all
together
and
cut
or
rather
dig
a
passage
through
the
huge
drift
in
front
of
the
stable
and
with
much
difficulty
get
some
food
for
the
seven
starving
horses
outside
who
were
keeping
a
few
yards
clear
by
incessantly
moving
about
the
snow
making
high
walls
all
around
them
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
completely
the
whole
aspect
of
the
surrounding
scenery
was
changed
the
gullies
were
all
filled
up
and
nearly
level
with
the
downs
cliffs
were
now
round
bluffs
there
was
no
vestige
of
a
fence
or
gate
or
shrub
to
be
seen
and
still
the
snow
came
down
as
if
it
had
only
just
begun
to
fall
out
of
doors
the
silence
was
like
death
i
was
told
for
i
could
only
peep
down
the
tunnel
dug
every
few
hours
at
the
door
my
two
maids
now
gave
way
and
sat
clasped
in
each
other
arms
all
day
crying
piteously
and
bewailing
their
fate
asking
me
whenever
i
came
into
the
kitchen
which
was
about
every
for
there
was
no
fire
elsewhere
and
oh
when
do
you
think
we
be
found
mum
of
course
this
only
referred
to
the
ultimate
discovery
of
our
bodies
there
was
a
great
search
for
the
cows
but
it
was
useless
the
gentlemen
sank
up
to
their
shoulders
in
snow
friday
the
same
state
of
things
a
little
flour
had
been
discovered
in
a
discarded
and
we
had
a
sort
of
and
water
the
only
thing
remaining
in
the
was
some
blacklead
and
i
was
considering
seriously
how
that
could
be
cooked
or
whether
it
would
be
better
raw
we
were
all
more
than
half
starved
and
quite
frozen
very
little
fire
in
the
kitchen
and
none
in
any
other
room
of
course
the
constant
thought
was
where
are
the
sheep
not
a
sign
or
sound
could
be
heard
the
dogs
kennels
were
covered
several
feet
deep
so
we
could
not
get
at
them
at
all
saturday
morning
the
first
good
news
i
heard
was
that
the
cows
had
been
found
and
dragged
by
ropes
down
to
the
enclosure
the
horses
had
made
for
they
were
half
dead
poor
beasts
but
after
struggling
for
four
hours
to
and
from
a
haystack
two
hundred
yards
off
one
end
of
which
was
unburied
some
oaten
hay
was
procured
for
them
there
was
now
not
a
particle
of
food
in
the
house
the
servants
remained
in
their
beds
declining
to
get
up
and
alleging
that
they
might
as
well
die
warm
in
the
middle
of
the
day
a
sort
of
was
organized
by
the
gentlemen
to
try
to
find
the
but
they
could
not
get
through
the
drift
however
they
dug
a
passage
to
the
and
returned
in
triumph
with
about
a
pound
of
very
rusty
bacon
they
had
found
hanging
up
there
this
was
useless
without
fuel
so
they
dug
for
a
little
gate
leading
to
the
garden
fortunately
hit
its
whereabouts
and
soon
had
it
broken
up
and
in
the
kitchen
grate
by
dint
of
taking
all
the
lead
out
of
the
shaking
it
and
collecting
every
pinch
of
we
got
enough
to
make
a
teapot
of
the
weakest
tea
a
cup
of
which
i
took
to
my
poor
crying
maids
in
their
beds
having
first
put
a
spoonful
of
the
last
bottle
of
whisky
which
the
house
possessed
into
it
for
there
was
neither
sugar
nor
milk
to
be
had
at
midnight
the
snow
ceased
for
a
few
hours
and
a
hard
sharp
frost
set
in
this
made
our
position
worse
for
they
could
now
make
no
impression
on
the
snow
and
only
broke
the
shovels
in
trying
i
began
to
think
seriously
of
following
the
maids
example
in
order
to
die
warm
we
could
do
nothing
but
wait
patiently
i
went
up
to
a
sort
of
attic
where
odds
and
ends
were
stowed
away
in
search
of
something
to
eat
but
could
find
nothing
more
tempting
than
a
supply
of
wax
matches
we
knew
there
was
a
cat
under
the
house
for
we
heard
her
mewing
and
it
was
suggested
to
take
up
the
carpets
first
then
the
boards
and
have
a
hunt
for
the
poor
old
pussy
but
we
agreed
to
bear
our
hunger
a
little
longer
chiefly
i
am
afraid
because
she
was
known
to
be
both
thin
and
aged
towards
noon
on
sunday
the
weather
suddenly
changed
and
rain
began
to
come
down
heavily
and
steadily
this
cheered
us
all
immensely
as
it
would
wash
the
snow
away
probably
and
so
it
did
to
some
degree
the
highest
drifts
near
the
house
lessened
considerably
in
a
few
hours
and
the
gentlemen
who
by
this
time
were
desperately
hungry
made
a
final
attempt
in
the
direction
of
the
found
the
roof
tore
off
some
shingles
and
returned
with
a
few
aged
hens
which
were
mere
bundles
of
feathers
after
their
week
starvation
the
servants
consented
to
rise
and
pluck
them
whilst
the
gentlemen
sallied
forth
once
more
to
the
and
with
great
difficulty
got
off
two
of
the
cap
or
top
rails
so
we
had
a
splendid
though
transitory
blaze
and
some
hot
stewed
fowl
it
was
more
of
a
soup
than
anything
else
but
still
we
thought
it
delicious
and
then
everybody
went
to
bed
again
for
the
house
was
quite
dark
still
and
the
oil
and
candles
were
running
very
low
on
monday
morning
the
snow
was
washed
off
the
roof
a
good
deal
by
the
deluge
of
rain
which
had
never
ceased
to
come
steadily
down
and
the
windows
were
cleared
a
little
just
at
the
top
but
we
were
delighted
with
the
improvement
and
some
cold
weak
for
breakfast
which
we
thought
excellent
on
getting
out
of
doors
the
gentlemen
reported
the
creeks
to
be
much
swollen
and
rushing
in
yellow
streams
down
the
sides
of
the
hills
over
the
snow
which
was
apparently
as
thick
as
ever
but
it
was
now
easier
to
get
through
at
the
surface
though
quite
solid
for
many
feet
from
the
ground
a
window
was
scraped
clear
through
which
i
could
see
the
desolate
landscape
out
of
doors
and
some
hay
was
carried
with
much
trouble
to
the
starving
cows
and
horses
but
this
was
a
work
of
almost
incredible
difficulty
some
more
fowls
were
procured
nearly
the
last
for
a
large
hole
in
the
roof
showed
most
of
them
dead
of
cold
and
hunger
we
were
all
in
much
better
spirits
on
this
night
for
there
were
signs
of
the
wind
shifting
from
south
to
and
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
i
suppose
we
were
anxiously
watching
and
desiring
this
change
as
it
was
the
only
chance
of
saving
the
thousands
of
sheep
and
lambs
we
now
knew
lay
buried
under
the
smooth
white
of
snow
before
bedtime
we
heard
the
fitful
gusts
we
knew
so
well
and
had
never
before
hailed
with
such
deep
joy
and
thankfulness
every
time
i
woke
the
same
welcome
sound
of
the
roaring
warm
gale
met
my
ears
and
we
were
prepared
for
the
pleasant
sight
on
tuesday
morning
of
the
highest
rocks
on
the
standing
out
gaunt
and
bare
once
more
the
wind
was
blowing
the
snow
off
the
hills
in
clouds
like
spray
and
melting
it
everywhere
so
rapidly
that
we
began
to
have
a
new
anxiety
for
the
creeks
were
rising
fast
and
running
in
wide
rivers
over
the
frozen
snow
on
the
banks
all
immediate
apprehension
of
starvation
however
was
removed
for
the
gentlemen
dug
a
pig
out
of
his
stye
where
he
had
been
warm
and
comfortable
with
plenty
of
straw
and
slaughtered
him
and
in
the
loft
of
the
stable
was
found
a
bag
of
indian
meal
for
fattening
poultry
which
made
excellent
cakes
of
bread
it
was
very
nasty
having
only
water
to
drink
at
every
meal
i
especially
missed
my
tea
for
breakfast
but
felt
ashamed
to
grumble
for
my
disagreeables
were
very
light
compared
to
those
of
the
three
gentlemen
from
morning
to
night
they
were
wet
through
as
the
snow
of
course
melted
the
moment
they
came
indoors
all
the
first
part
of
the
last
week
they
used
to
work
out
of
doors
trying
to
get
food
and
fuel
or
feeding
the
horses
in
the
teeth
of
a
bitter
wind
with
the
snow
driving
like
powdered
glass
against
their
smarting
hands
and
faces
and
they
were
as
cheery
and
merry
as
possible
through
it
all
trying
hard
to
pretend
they
were
neither
hungry
nor
cold
when
they
must
have
been
both
going
out
of
doors
at
this
stage
of
affairs
simply
meant
plunging
up
to
their
middle
in
a
slush
of
snow
which
wet
them
thoroughly
in
a
moment
and
they
never
had
dry
clothes
on
again
till
they
changed
after
dark
when
there
was
no
more
possibility
of
outdoor
work
wednesday
morning
broke
bright
and
clear
for
the
first
time
since
sunday
week
we
actually
saw
the
sun
although
the
had
done
so
much
good
for
us
and
a
light
wind
still
blew
softly
from
that
quarter
the
snow
was
yet
very
deep
but
i
felt
in
such
high
spirits
that
i
determined
to
venture
out
and
equipped
myself
in
a
huge
pair
of
f
made
of
well
greased
with
to
keep
the
wet
out
these
i
put
on
over
my
own
thick
boots
but
my
precautions
did
nought
avail
for
the
first
step
i
took
sank
me
deep
in
the
snow
over
the
tops
of
my
enormous
boots
they
filled
immediately
and
then
merely
served
to
keep
the
snow
securely
packed
round
my
ankles
however
i
struggled
bravely
on
every
now
and
then
sinking
up
to
my
shoulders
and
having
to
be
hauled
out
by
main
force
the
first
thing
done
was
to
dig
out
the
dogs
who
assisted
the
process
by
vigorously
scratching
away
inside
and
tunnelling
towards
us
poor
things
how
thin
they
looked
but
they
were
quite
warm
and
after
indulging
in
a
long
drink
at
the
nearest
creek
they
bounded
about
like
mad
creatures
the
only
casualties
in
the
kennels
were
two
little
puppies
who
were
lying
cuddled
up
as
if
they
were
asleep
but
proved
to
be
stiff
and
cold
and
a
very
old
but
still
valuable
collie
called
gipsy
she
was
enduring
such
agonies
from
rheumatism
that
it
was
terrible
to
hear
her
howls
and
after
trying
to
relieve
her
by
rubbing
taking
her
into
the
in
fact
doing
all
we
could
for
her
it
seemed
better
and
kinder
to
shoot
her
two
days
afterwards
we
now
agreed
to
venture
into
the
paddock
and
see
what
had
happened
to
the
about
three
hundred
yards
from
the
house
i
think
i
have
told
you
that
the
creek
had
been
here
dammed
up
with
a
sod
wall
twelve
feet
high
and
a
fine
deep
and
broad
pond
made
which
was
cleared
of
weeds
and
grass
and
kept
entirely
for
the
gentlemen
to
have
a
plunge
and
swim
at
daylight
of
a
summer
morning
there
had
been
a
wide
trench
cut
about
two
feet
from
the
top
so
as
to
carry
off
the
water
and
hitherto
this
had
answered
perfectly
the
first
thing
we
had
to
do
was
to
walk
over
the
high
gate
leading
into
the
paddock
just
the
topmost
bar
was
sticking
up
but
there
was
not
a
trace
of
the
little
or
of
the
fence
which
was
quite
a
low
one
we
were
however
rejoiced
to
see
that
on
the
ridges
of
the
sunny
downs
there
were
patches
or
rather
streaks
of
tussocks
visible
and
they
spread
in
size
every
moment
for
the
sun
was
quite
warm
and
the
had
done
much
towards
softening
the
snow
it
took
us
a
long
time
to
get
down
to
where
the
for
the
sod
wall
was
quite
carried
away
and
there
was
now
only
a
heap
of
ruin
with
a
muddy
torrent
pouring
through
the
large
gap
and
washing
it
still
more
away
close
to
this
was
a
very
sunny
sheltered
down
or
rather
hill
and
as
the
snow
was
rapidly
melting
off
its
warm
sloping
sides
we
agreed
to
climb
it
and
see
if
any
sheep
could
be
discovered
for
up
to
this
time
there
had
been
none
seen
or
heard
though
we
knew
several
thousands
must
be
on
this
flat
and
the
adjoining
ones
as
soon
as
we
got
to
the
top
the
first
glance
showed
us
a
small
dusky
patch
close
to
the
edge
of
one
of
the
deepest
and
widest
creeks
at
the
bottom
of
the
experienced
eyes
saw
they
were
sheep
but
to
me
they
had
not
the
shape
of
animals
at
all
though
they
were
quite
near
enough
to
be
seen
distinctly
i
observed
the
gentlemen
exchange
looks
of
alarm
and
they
said
to
each
other
some
low
words
from
which
i
gathered
that
they
feared
the
worst
before
we
went
down
to
the
flat
we
took
a
long
careful
look
round
and
made
out
another
patch
dark
by
comparison
with
the
snow
some
two
hundred
yards
lower
down
the
creek
but
apparently
in
the
water
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
hill
the
snow
seemed
to
have
drifted
even
more
deeply
for
the
long
narrow
valley
which
lay
there
presented
as
far
as
we
could
see
one
smooth
level
on
the
dazzling
white
surface
the
least
fleck
shows
and
i
can
never
forget
how
beautiful
some
with
their
dark
blue
plumage
short
pert
white
tails
and
long
bright
legs
looked
as
they
searched
slowly
along
the
banks
of
the
swollen
creek
for
some
traces
of
their
former
haunts
but
every
tuft
of
lay
bent
and
buried
deep
beneath
its
heavy
covering
the
gentlemen
wanted
me
to
go
home
before
they
attempted
to
see
the
extent
of
the
disaster
which
we
all
felt
must
be
very
great
but
i
found
it
impossible
to
do
anything
but
accompany
them
i
am
half
glad
and
half
sorry
now
that
i
was
obstinate
glad
because
i
helped
a
little
at
a
time
when
the
least
help
was
precious
and
sorry
because
it
was
really
such
a
horrible
sight
even
the
first
glance
showed
us
that
as
soon
as
we
got
near
the
spot
we
had
observed
we
were
walking
on
frozen
sheep
embedded
in
the
snow
one
over
the
other
but
at
all
events
their
misery
had
been
over
some
time
it
was
more
horrible
to
see
the
drowning
or
just
drowned
mob
as
sheep
are
technically
called
which
had
made
the
dusky
patch
we
had
noticed
from
the
hill
no
one
can
ever
tell
how
many
hundred
ewes
and
lambs
had
taken
refuge
under
the
high
terrace
which
forms
the
bank
of
the
creek
the
snow
had
soon
covered
them
up
but
they
probably
were
quite
warm
and
dry
at
first
the
terrible
mischief
was
caused
by
the
creek
rising
so
rapidly
and
filtering
through
the
snow
which
it
gradually
dissolved
drowned
them
as
they
stood
huddled
together
those
nearest
the
edge
of
the
water
of
course
went
first
but
we
were
fortunately
in
time
to
save
a
good
many
though
the
living
seemed
as
nothing
compared
to
the
heaps
of
dead
we
did
not
waste
a
moment
in
regrets
or
idleness
the
most
experienced
of
the
gentlemen
said
briefly
what
was
to
be
done
and
took
his
coat
off
the
other
coats
and
my
little
astrachan
jacket
were
lying
by
its
side
in
an
instant
and
we
all
set
to
work
sometimes
up
to
our
knees
in
icy
water
digging
at
the
bank
of
snow
above
us
if
you
can
call
it
digging
when
we
had
nothing
but
our
hands
to
dig
or
rather
scratch
with
oh
how
hot
we
were
in
five
minutes
the
sun
beating
on
us
and
the
reflection
from
the
snow
making
its
rays
almost
blinding
it
was
of
no
use
my
attempting
to
rescue
the
sheep
for
i
could
not
move
them
even
when
i
had
the
snow
away
from
one
a
sheep
especially
with
its
fleece
full
of
snow
is
beyond
my
small
powers
even
the
lambs
i
found
a
tremendous
weight
and
it
must
have
been
very
absurd
if
an
idler
had
been
by
to
see
me
with
a
little
lamb
in
my
arms
tumbling
down
at
every
second
step
but
still
struggling
manfully
towards
the
dry
oasis
where
we
put
each
animal
as
it
was
dug
out
the
dear
doggies
helped
us
beautifully
working
so
eagerly
and
yet
so
wisely
under
their
master
eye
as
patient
and
gentle
with
the
poor
stiffened
creatures
as
if
they
could
feel
for
them
i
was
astonished
at
the
vitality
of
some
of
the
survivors
if
they
had
been
very
far
back
and
not
chilled
by
the
water
they
were
quite
lively
the
strongest
sheep
were
put
across
the
stream
by
the
dogs
who
were
obedient
to
their
master
finger
and
not
to
be
induced
on
any
terms
to
allow
the
sheep
to
land
a
yard
to
one
side
of
the
place
on
the
opposite
bank
but
just
where
they
were
to
go
a
good
many
were
swept
away
but
after
six
hours
work
we
counted
rescued
ones
slowly
trailing
up
the
low
sunny
hill
i
have
mentioned
and
nibbling
at
the
tussocks
as
they
went
the
proportion
of
lambs
was
of
course
very
small
but
the
only
wonder
to
me
is
that
there
were
any
alive
at
all
if
i
had
been
able
to
stop
my
scratching
but
for
a
moment
i
would
have
had
what
the
servants
call
a
good
cry
over
one
little
group
i
laid
bare
two
fine
young
ewes
were
standing
leaning
against
each
other
in
a
sloping
position
like
a
tent
frozen
and
immoveable
between
them
quite
dry
and
as
lively
as
a
kitten
was
a
dear
little
lamb
of
about
a
month
old
belonging
to
one
the
lamb
of
the
other
lay
curled
up
at
her
feet
dead
and
cold
i
really
believe
they
had
hit
upon
this
way
of
keeping
the
other
alive
a
more
pathetic
sight
i
never
beheld
it
is
needless
to
say
that
we
were
all
most
dreadfully
exhausted
by
the
time
the
sun
went
down
and
it
began
to
freeze
nothing
but
the
sheer
impossibility
of
doing
anything
more
in
the
hardening
snow
and
approaching
darkness
made
us
leave
off
even
then
though
we
had
not
tasted
food
all
day
the
gentlemen
took
an
old
ewe
who
could
not
stand
though
it
was
not
actually
dead
up
to
the
stable
and
killed
it
to
give
the
poor
dogs
a
good
meal
and
then
they
had
to
get
some
more
rails
off
the
to
cook
our
own
supper
of
pork
and
maize
the
next
morning
was
again
bright
with
a
warm
wind
so
the
effect
of
the
night
frost
soon
disappeared
and
we
were
hard
at
work
directly
after
breakfast
nothing
would
induce
me
to
stay
at
home
but
i
armed
myself
with
a
to
dig
and
we
made
our
way
to
the
other
mob
but
alas
there
was
nothing
to
do
in
the
way
of
saving
life
for
all
the
sheep
were
dead
there
was
a
large
island
formed
at
a
bend
in
the
creek
where
the
water
had
swept
with
such
fury
round
a
point
as
to
wash
the
snow
and
sheep
all
away
together
till
at
some
little
obstacle
they
began
to
accumulate
in
a
heap
i
counted
dead
ewes
in
one
spot
but
i
did
not
stay
to
count
the
lambs
we
returned
to
the
place
where
we
had
been
digging
the
day
before
and
set
the
dogs
to
hunt
in
the
drifts
wherever
they
began
to
scratch
we
shovelled
the
snow
away
and
were
sure
to
find
sheep
either
dead
or
nearly
so
however
we
liberated
a
good
many
more
this
sort
of
work
continued
till
the
following
saturday
when
f
returned
having
had
a
most
dangerous
journey
as
the
roads
are
still
blocked
up
in
places
with
but
he
was
anxious
to
get
back
knowing
i
must
have
been
going
through
hard
times
he
was
terribly
shocked
at
the
state
of
things
among
the
sheep
in
christchurch
no
definite
news
had
reached
them
from
any
quarter
all
the
coaches
were
stopped
and
the
telegraph
wires
broken
down
by
the
snow
he
arrived
about
and
directly
after
the
meal
we
still
called
dinner
started
off
over
the
hills
to
my
nest
of
cockatoos
and
brought
back
some
of
the
men
with
him
to
help
to
search
for
the
sheep
and
to
skin
those
that
were
dead
as
fast
as
possible
he
worked
himself
all
day
at
the
skinning
a
horrible
job
but
the
fleeces
were
worth
something
and
soon
all
the
fences
as
they
began
to
emerge
from
the
snow
were
tapestried
with
these
ghastly
skins
and
walking
became
most
disagreeable
on
account
of
the
evil
odours
arising
every
few
yards
we
forgot
all
our
personal
sufferings
in
anxiety
about
the
surviving
sheep
and
when
the
dray
arrived
it
seemed
a
small
boon
compared
to
the
discovery
of
a
nice
little
mob
feeding
tranquilly
on
a
sunny
spur
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
our
loss
until
the
grand
muster
at
shearing
but
we
may
set
it
down
at
half
our
flock
and
our
lambs
or
at
least
per
cent
of
them
our
neighbours
are
all
as
busy
as
we
are
so
no
accurate
accounts
of
their
sufferings
or
losses
have
reached
us
but
to
judge
by
appearances
the
distant
ranges
must
have
felt
the
storm
more
severely
even
than
we
have
and
although
the
snow
did
not
drift
to
such
a
depth
on
the
plains
as
with
us
or
lie
so
long
on
the
ground
they
suffered
just
as
much
for
the
sheep
took
shelter
under
the
high
and
the
tragedy
of
the
creeks
was
enacted
on
a
still
larger
scale
or
they
drifted
along
before
the
first
day
gale
till
they
came
to
a
wire
fence
and
there
they
were
soon
covered
up
and
trampled
each
other
to
death
not
only
were
sheep
but
cattle
found
dead
in
hundreds
along
the
fences
on
the
plains
the
newspapers
give
half
a
million
as
a
rough
estimate
of
the
loss
among
the
flocks
in
this
province
alone
we
have
no
reliable
news
from
other
parts
of
the
island
only
vague
rumours
of
the
storm
having
been
still
more
severe
in
the
province
of
otago
which
lies
to
the
south
and
would
be
right
in
its
track
the
only
thing
which
all
are
agreed
in
saying
is
that
there
never
has
been
such
a
storm
before
for
the
maories
are
strong
in
weather
traditions
and
though
they
prophesied
this
one
it
is
said
they
have
no
legend
of
anything
like
it
ever
having
happened
letter
xxi
wild

in
the

bush
mount
torlesse
october
we
are
staying
for
a
week
at
a
charming
little
white
cottage
covered
with
roses
and
honeysuckles
nestled
under
the
shadow
of
this
grand
mountain
to
make
some
expeditions
after
wild
cattle
in
the
great
kowai
bush
i
am
afraid
that
it
does
not
sound
a
very
orderly
and
feminine
occupation
but
i
enjoy
it
thoroughly
and
have
covered
myself
with
glory
and
honour
by
my
powers
of
walking
all
day
we
have
already
spent
three
long
happy
days
in
the
bush
and
although
they
have
not
resulted
in
much
slaughter
of
our
big
game
still
i
for
one
am
quite
as
well
pleased
as
if
we
had
returned
laden
with
as
many
beeves
as
used
to
come
in
from
a
border
foray
i
am
not
going
to
inflict
an
account
of
each
expedition
on
you
one
will
serve
to
give
an
idea
of
all
for
though
there
is
no
monotony
in
nature
it
may
chance
that
frequent
descriptions
of
her
become
so
and
this
i
will
not
risk
our
ride
over
here
was
a
sufficiently
ridiculous
affair
owing
to
the
misbehaviour
of
the
for
it
was
impossible
upon
this
occasion
to
manage
with
as
little
luggage
as
usual
so
we
arranged
to
take
a
a
most
luxury
and
on
each
side
of
it
was
to
be
slung
a
rifle
and
a
gun
and
smaller
bags
of
bullets
shot
and
disposed
to
the
best
advantage
on
the
this
was
all
very
well
in
theory
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
the
proper
steady
old
horse
who
was
to
bear
the
pack
was
not
forthcoming
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
go
on
a
visit
to
a
neighbouring
run
so
the
only
available
beast
was
a
young
chestnut
of
most
uncertain
temper
the
process
of
saddling
him
was
a
long
one
as
he
objected
to
each
item
of
his
load
as
soon
as
it
was
put
on
especially
to
the
guns
but
f
was
very
patient
and
took
good
care
to
tie
and
otherwise
fasten
everything
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
master
tucker
called
i
suppose
after
the
immortal
tommy
to
get
rid
of
his
load
by
either
kicking
or
plunging
at
last
we
mounted
and
rode
by
a
among
the
hills
for
some
twelve
miles
or
so
then
across
miles
of
plain
and
finally
we
forded
a
river
the
was
about
as
bad
as
a
path
could
be
with
several
wide
jumps
across
creeks
at
the
bottom
of
the
numerous
deep
ravines
or
gullies
as
we
call
them
f
rode
first
for
we
could
only
go
in
single
file
with
the
detestable
bridle
over
his
arm
then
came
the
chestnut
with
his
ears
well
back
and
his
eyes
all
whites
in
his
efforts
to
look
at
his
especial
aversion
the
guns
he
kicked
all
the
way
down
the
many
hills
and
pulled
back
in
the
most
aggravating
manner
at
each
ascent
and
when
we
came
to
a
creek
sat
down
on
his
tail
refusing
to
stir
my
position
was
a
most
trying
one
the
track
was
so
bad
that
i
would
fain
have
given
my
mind
entirely
to
my
own
safety
but
instead
of
this
all
my
attention
was
centred
on
tucker
the
odious
when
we
first
started
i
expressed
to
f
my
fear
that
tucker
would
fairly
drag
him
off
his
own
saddle
and
he
admitted
that
it
was
very
likely
adding
you
must
flog
him
this
made
me
feel
that
it
entirely
depended
on
my
efforts
whether
f
was
to
be
killed
or
not
so
i
provided
myself
with
a
small
in
addition
to
my
own
little
and
we
set
off
from
the
first
yard
tucker
objected
to
go
but
there
were
friendly
sticks
to
urge
him
on
however
we
soon
got
beyond
the
reasonable
limits
of
help
and
i
tried
desperately
to
impress
upon
tucker
that
i
was
going
to
be
very
severe
for
this
purpose
i
flourished
my
in
a
way
that
drove
my
own
skittish
mare
nearly
frantic
and
never
touched
tucker
whom
f
was
dragging
along
by
main
force
at
last
i
gave
up
the
with
its
unmanageable
three
yards
of
lash
and
dropped
it
on
the
track
to
be
picked
up
as
we
came
home
i
now
tried
to
hit
tucker
with
my
but
he
flung
his
heels
up
in
helen
face
the
moment
i
touched
him
i
was
in
perfect
despair
very
much
afraid
of
a
sudden
swerve
on
my
part
sending
us
both
down
the
precipice
and
in
equal
dread
of
seeing
f
pulled
off
his
saddle
by
tucker
suddenly
planting
his
firmly
together
f
himself
with
the
expression
of
a
martyr
looking
round
every
now
and
then
to
say
ca
you
make
him
come
on
and
i
hitting
wildly
and
vainly
feeling
all
the
time
that
i
was
worse
than
useless
at
last
the
bright
idea
occurred
to
me
to
ride
nearly
alongside
of
the
fiendish
tucker
but
a
little
above
him
on
the
hill
so
as
to
be
able
to
strike
him
fairly
without
fear
of
his
heels
as
far
as
tucker
was
concerned
this
plan
answered
perfectly
for
he
soon
found
out
he
had
to
go
but
helen
objected
most
decidedly
to
being
taken
off
the
comparative
safety
of
the
track
and
made
to
walk
on
a
slippery
sloping
hill
where
she
could
hardly
keep
her
feet
however
we
got
on
much
faster
this
way
oh
how
tired
i
was
of
striking
tucker
i
do
believe
i
hurt
him
much
but
i
felt
quite
cruel
when
we
came
to
the
plain
i
begged
f
to
let
me
lead
him
so
we
changed
and
there
was
no
holding
back
on
the
chestnut
part
then
it
must
have
been
like
the
grass
and
the
stones
in
the
fable
i
never
was
more
thankful
than
when
that
ride
was
over
though
its
disagreeables
were
soon
forgotten
in
the
warm
welcome
we
received
from
our
bachelor
hosts
and
the
incessant
discussions
about
the
next
day
excursion
we
had
finished
breakfast
by
seven
the
following
morning
and
were
ready
to
start
of
course
the
gentlemen
were
very
fussy
about
their
equipments
and
hung
themselves
all
over
with
cartridges
and
bags
of
bullets
and
then
they
had
to
take
care
that
their
and
were
filled
and
lastly
each
carried
a
little
flask
of
brandy
or
sherry
in
case
of
being
lost
and
having
to
camp
out
i
felt
quite
unconcerned
having
only
my
flask
with
cold
tea
in
it
to
see
about
and
a
good
was
easily
chosen
my
costume
may
be
described
as
uncompromising
for
it
had
been
explained
to
me
that
there
were
no
paths
but
real
rough
bush
walking
so
i
dispensed
with
all
little
feminine
adornments
even
to
the
chignon
tucked
my
hair
away
as
if
i
was
going
to
put
on
a
and
covered
it
with
a
scotch
bonnet
the
rest
of
my
toilette
must
have
been
equally
shocking
to
the
eyes
of
taste
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
the
general
effect
most
hideous
but
one
great
comfort
was
no
one
looked
at
me
they
were
all
too
much
absorbed
in
preparations
for
a
great
slaughter
and
i
only
came
at
all
upon
sufferance
the
unexpressed
but
prevailing
dread
i
could
plainly
see
was
that
i
should
knock
up
and
become
a
bore
necessitating
an
early
return
home
but
i
knew
better
an
american
waggon
and
some
ponies
were
waiting
to
take
the
whole
party
to
the
entrance
of
the
bush
about
four
miles
off
and
in
spite
of
having
to
cross
a
rough
which
is
always
a
slow
process
it
did
not
take
us
very
long
to
reach
our
first
point
here
we
dismounted
just
at
the
edge
of
the
great
dense
forest
and
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
in
fine
arrangements
struck
into
a
path
or
made
for
about
three
miles
into
the
bush
for
the
convenience
of
dragging
out
the
felled
trees
by
ropes
or
chains
attached
to
bullocks
they
are
not
placed
upon
a
waggon
so
you
may
easily
imagine
the
state
the
track
was
in
ploughed
up
by
huge
logs
of
timber
dragged
on
the
ground
and
by
the
bullocks
hoofs
besides
it
was
a
mere
slough
with
deep
holes
of
mud
in
it
and
we
scrambled
along
its
extreme
edge
chiefly
trusting
to
the
trees
on
each
side
which
still
lay
as
they
had
been
felled
the
men
not
considering
them
good
enough
to
remove
at
last
we
came
to
a
clearing
and
i
quite
despair
of
making
you
understand
how
romantic
and
lovely
this
open
space
in
the
midst
of
the
tall
trees
looked
that
beautiful
spring
morning
i
involuntarily
thought
of
the
descriptions
in
paul
and
virginia
for
the
luxuriance
of
the
growth
was
quite
tropical
for
about
two
acres
the
trees
had
been
nearly
all
felled
only
one
or
two
giants
remaining
their
stumps
were
already
hidden
by
clematis
and
wild
creepers
of
other
kinds
or
by
a
sort
of
fern
very
like
the
which
will
only
grow
on
the
bark
of
trees
and
its
glossy
leaves
made
an
exquisite
contrast
to
the
rough
old
root
the
bushmen
as
the
men
who
have
bought
sections
and
settled
in
the
bush
are
called
had
scattered
english
all
over
the
rich
leafy
mould
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
bright
green
grass
kept
short
and
thick
by
a
few
tame
goats
browsing
about
before
us
was
the
steep
bank
of
the
river
waimakiriri
and
a
few
yards
from
its
edge
stood
a
picturesque
little
cottage
surrounded
by
a
rustic
fence
which
enclosed
a
strip
of
garden
gay
with
common
english
spring
flowers
besides
more
useful
things
potatoes
etc
the
river
was
about
two
hundred
yards
broad
just
here
and
though
it
foamed
below
us
we
could
also
see
it
stretching
away
in
the
distance
almost
like
a
lake
till
a
great
bluff
hid
it
from
our
eyes
overhead
the
trees
were
alive
with
flocks
of
wild
pigeons
parroquets
and
other
birds
chattering
and
twittering
incessantly
and
as
we
stood
on
the
steep
bank
and
looked
down
i
do
think
a
minute
passed
without
a
brace
of
wild
ducks
flying
past
grey
blue
and
paradise
these
latter
are
the
most
beautiful
plumaged
birds
i
ever
saw
belonging
to
the
duck
tribe
and
when
young
are
very
good
eating
quite
as
delicate
as
the
famous
this
sight
so
excited
our
younger
sportsmen
that
they
scrambled
down
the
high
precipice
followed
by
a
and
in
five
minutes
had
bagged
as
many
brace
we
could
not
give
them
any
more
time
for
it
was
past
nine
and
we
were
all
eager
to
start
on
the
serious
business
of
the
day
but
before
we
left
the
mistress
of
this
charming
insisted
on
our
having
some
hot
coffee
and
scones
and
wild
honey
a
most
delicious
second
breakfast
there
was
a
pretty
little
girl
growing
up
and
a
younger
child
both
the
picture
of
health
the
only
drawback
seemed
to
be
the
mosquitoes
it
was
not
very
lonely
for
one
or
two
other
huts
stood
in
clearings
adjoining
and
furnished
us
with
three
bushmen
as
guides
and
assistants
i
must
say
they
were
the
most
picturesque
of
the
party
being
all
handsome
men
dressed
in
red
flannel
shirts
and
leathern
knickerbockers
and
gaiters
they
had
fine
beards
and
wore
diggers
hats
a
of
american
origin
a
sort
of
made
of
plush
capable
of
being
crushed
into
any
shape
and
very
becoming
all
were
armed
with
either
rifle
or
gun
and
one
carried
an
axe
and
a
coil
of
rope
another
had
a
gun
such
as
is
seldom
seen
out
of
an
arsenal
it
was
an
old
flint
lock
but
had
been
altered
to
a
percussion
its
owner
was
very
proud
of
it
not
so
much
for
its
intrinsic
beauty
though
it
once
had
been
a
costly
and
splendid
weapon
and
was
elaborately
inlaid
with
but
because
it
had
belonged
to
a
former
duke
of
devonshire
in
spite
of
its
claims
to
consideration
on
this
head
as
well
as
its
own
beauty
we
all
eyed
it
with
extreme
disfavour
on
account
of
a
peculiarity
it
possessed
of
not
going
off
when
it
was
intended
to
do
so
but
about
five
minutes
afterwards
it
was
suggested
to
me
very
politely
that
i
might
possibly
prefer
to
remain
behind
and
spend
the
day
in
this
picturesque
spot
but
this
offer
i
declined
steadily
i
think
the
bushmen
objected
to
my
presence
more
than
any
one
else
as
they
really
meant
work
and
dreaded
having
to
turn
back
for
a
tired
female
they
never
spoke
of
me
by
any
other
term
at
last
all
the
information
was
collected
about
the
probable
whereabouts
of
the
wild
cattle
it
was
so
contradictory
that
it
must
have
been
difficult
to
arrange
any
plan
by
it
and
we
started
a
few
hundred
yards
took
us
past
the
clearings
and
into
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
we
had
left
the
sun
shining
brightly
overhead
here
it
was
all
a
great
green
gloom
i
must
describe
to
you
the
order
in
which
we
marched
first
came
two
of
the
most
experienced
who
carried
a
tomahawk
or
light
axe
with
which
to
clear
the
most
cruel
of
the
brambles
away
and
to
notch
the
trees
as
a
guide
to
us
on
our
return
and
also
a
compass
for
we
had
to
steer
for
a
certain
point
the
bearings
of
which
we
knew
of
course
the
procession
was
in
indian
file
next
to
these
pioneers
walked
very
cautiously
almost
on
tiptoe
four
of
our
sportsmen
then
i
came
and
four
or
five
others
less
keen
or
less
well
armed
brought
up
the
rear
i
may
here
confess
that
i
endured
in
silence
agonies
of
apprehension
for
my
personal
safety
all
day
it
was
so
dreadful
to
see
a
bramble
or
wild
creeper
catch
in
the
lock
of
the
rifle
before
me
and
to
reflect
that
unless
its
owner
was
very
careful
it
might
go
off
of
its
own
accord
and
to
know
that
i
was
exposed
to
a
similar
danger
from
those
behind
we
soon
got
on
the
fresh
tracks
of
some
cows
and
proceeded
most
cautiously
and
silently
but
it
could
hardly
be
called
walking
it
was
alternately
pushing
through
dense
undergrowth
crawling
beneath
or
climbing
over
high
barricades
made
by
fallen
trees
these
latter
obstacles
i
found
the
most
difficult
for
the
bark
was
so
slippery
and
once
when
with
much
difficulty
i
had
scrambled
up
a
pile
of
at
least
ten
feet
high
i
incautiously
stepped
on
some
rotten
wood
at
the
top
and
went
through
it
into
a
sort
of
deep
pit
out
of
which
it
was
very
hard
to
climb
on
comparing
notes
afterwards
we
found
that
although
we
had
walked
without
a
moment
cessation
for
eleven
hours
during
the
day
a
pedometer
only
gave
miles
as
the
distance
accomplished
before
we
had
been
in
the
bush
half
an
hour
our
faces
were
terribly
scratched
and
bleeding
and
so
were
the
gentlemen
hands
my
wrists
also
suffered
as
my
gauntlets
would
not
do
their
duty
and
lie
flat
there
were
myriads
of
birds
around
us
all
perfectly
tame
many
flew
from
twig
to
twig
accompanying
us
with
their
little
pert
heads
on
one
side
full
of
curiosity
the
only
animals
we
saw
were
some
wild
sheep
looking
very
disreputable
with
their
long
tails
and
torn
trailing
fleeces
of
six
or
seven
years
growth
there
are
supposed
to
be
some
hundreds
of
these
in
the
bush
who
have
strayed
into
it
years
ago
when
they
were
lambs
from
neighbouring
runs
the
last
man
in
the
silent
procession
put
a
match
into
a
dead
tree
every
here
and
there
to
serve
as
a
torch
to
guide
us
back
in
the
dark
but
this
required
great
judgment
for
fear
of
setting
the
whole
forest
on
fire
the
tree
required
to
be
full
of
damp
decay
which
would
only
smoulder
and
not
blaze
we
intended
to
steer
for
a
station
on
the
other
side
of
a
narrow
neck
of
the
great
bush
ten
miles
off
as
nearly
as
we
could
guess
but
we
made
many
detours
after
fresh
tracks
once
these
led
us
to
the
brink
of
such
a
pretty
creek
exactly
like
a
scotch
burn
wide
and
noisy
tumbling
down
from
rock
to
rock
but
not
very
deep
after
a
whispered
consultation
it
was
determined
to
follow
up
this
creek
to
a
favourite
of
the
cattle
but
it
was
easier
walking
in
the
water
than
on
the
banks
so
all
the
gentlemen
stepped
in
one
after
another
i
hesitated
a
moment
with
one
usual
antipathy
to
wet
feet
when
a
stalwart
bushman
approached
with
rather
a
victimised
air
and
the
remark
ye
heavy
nae
doot
to
carry
i
was
partly
affronted
at
this
prejudgment
of
the
case
and
partly
determined
to
show
that
i
was
equal
to
the
emergency
for
i
immediately
jumped
into
the
water
frightening
myself
a
good
deal
by
the
tremendous
splash
i
made
and
meeting
reproving
glances
and
nine
heads
were
shaken
violently
at
me
nothing
could
be
more
beautiful
than
the
winding
banks
of
this
creek
fringed
with
large
ferns
in
endless
variety
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
sun
and
sky
once
more
overhead
but
i
can
not
say
that
it
was
the
easiest
possible
walking
and
i
soon
found
out
that
the
cleverest
thing
to
do
was
to
wade
a
little
way
behind
the
shortest
gentleman
of
the
party
for
when
he
disappeared
in
a
hole
i
knew
it
in
time
to
avoid
a
similar
fate
whereas
as
long
as
i
persisted
in
stalking
solemnly
after
my
own
tall
natural
protector
i
found
that
i
was
always
getting
into
difficulties
in
unexpectedly
deep
places
i
saw
the
bushmen
whispering
together
and
examining
the
rocks
in
some
places
but
i
found
on
inquiry
that
their
thoughts
were
occupied
at
the
moment
by
other
ideas
than
sport
one
of
them
had
been
a
digger
and
was
pronouncing
an
opinion
that
this
creek
was
very
likely
to
prove
a
home
of
the
gold
some
day
there
is
a
strong
feeling
prevalent
that
gold
will
be
found
in
great
quantities
all
over
the
island
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
water
is
very
shallow
but
the
stream
evidently
comes
down
with
tremendous
force
in
the
winter
and
they
talk
of
having
found
the
colour
of
gold
in
some
places
we
proceeded
in
this
way
for
about
three
miles
till
we
reached
a
beautiful
clear
deep
pool
into
which
the
water
fell
from
a
height
in
a
little
cascade
the
banks
here
were
well
trodden
and
the
quite
recent
great
excitement
was
caused
by
hearing
a
distant
lowing
but
after
much
listening
in
true
indian
fashion
with
the
ear
to
the
ground
everybody
was
of
a
different
opinion
as
to
the
side
from
whence
the
sound
proceeded
so
we
determined
to
keep
on
our
original
course
the
compass
was
once
more
produced
and
we
struck
into
a
dense
wood
of
black
birch
ever
since
we
left
the
clearing
from
which
the
start
was
made
we
had
turned
our
backs
on
the
river
but
about
three
in
the
afternoon
we
came
suddenly
on
it
again
and
stood
on
the
most
beautiful
spot
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
we
were
on
the
top
of
a
high
precipice
densely
wooded
to
the
water
edge
some
explorers
in
bygone
days
must
have
camped
here
for
trees
were
felled
and
the
thick
had
been
burnt
for
a
few
yards
just
enough
to
let
us
take
in
the
magnificent
view
before
and
around
us
below
roared
and
foamed
among
great
boulders
washed
down
from
the
cliff
the
waimakiriri
in
the
middle
of
it
lay
a
long
narrow
strip
of
white
shingle
covered
with
water
in
the
winter
floods
but
now
shining
like
snow
in
the
bright
sunlight
beyond
this
the
river
flowed
as
placidly
as
a
lake
in
cool
green
depths
reflecting
every
leaf
of
the
forest
on
the
high
bank
or
cliff
opposite
to
our
right
it
stretched
away
with
round
headlands
covered
with
timber
running
down
in
soft
curves
to
the
water
but
on
our
left
was
the
most
perfect
composition
for
a
picture
in
the
foreground
a
great
reach
of
smooth
water
except
just
under
the
bank
we
stood
on
where
the
current
was
strong
and
rapid
a
little
sparkling
beach
and
a
vast
forest
rising
up
from
its
narrow
border
extending
over
chain
after
chain
of
hills
till
they
rose
to
the
glacial
region
and
then
the
splendid
peaks
of
the
snowy
range
broke
the
deep
blue
sky
line
with
their
grand
outlines
all
this
beauty
would
have
been
almost
too
oppressive
it
was
on
such
a
large
scale
and
the
solitude
was
so
intense
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
pretty
little
touch
of
life
and
movement
afforded
by
the
hut
belonging
to
the
station
we
were
bound
for
it
was
only
a
rough
building
made
of
slabs
of
wood
with
cob
between
but
there
was
a
bit
of
fence
and
the
corner
of
a
garden
and
an
english
grass
paddock
which
looked
about
as
big
as
a
from
where
we
stood
a
horse
or
two
and
a
couple
of
cows
were
tethered
near
and
we
could
hear
the
bark
of
a
dog
a
more
complete
hermitage
could
not
have
been
desired
by
diogenes
himself
and
for
the
first
time
we
felt
ashamed
of
invading
the
recluse
in
such
a
formidable
body
but
ungrudging
hospitality
is
so
universal
in
new
zealand
that
we
took
courage
and
began
our
descent
it
really
was
like
walking
down
the
side
of
a
house
and
no
one
could
stir
a
step
without
at
least
one
arm
round
a
tree
i
had
no
gun
to
carry
so
i
clung
frantically
with
both
arms
to
each
stem
in
succession
the
steepness
of
the
cliff
was
the
reason
we
could
take
in
all
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
us
for
the
forest
was
as
thick
as
ever
but
we
could
see
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
as
the
ground
dropped
sheer
down
almost
in
a
straight
line
from
the
plateau
we
had
been
travelling
on
all
day
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
shingle
on
which
we
had
to
walk
for
a
few
hundred
yards
we
bethought
ourselves
of
our
toilettes
the
needle
and
thread
i
had
brought
did
good
service
in
making
us
more
presentable
we
discovered
however
that
our
faces
were
a
perfect
network
of
fine
scratches
some
of
which
go
on
bleeding
in
spite
of
applications
our
boots
were
nearly
dry
and
my
petticoat
short
as
it
was
proved
to
be
the
only
damp
garment
this
was
the
fault
of
my
first
jump
into
the
water
we
put
the
least
scratched
and
most
member
of
the
party
in
the
van
and
followed
him
amid
much
barking
of
dogs
to
the
low
porch
and
after
hearing
a
cheery
come
in
answering
our
modest
tap
at
the
door
we
trooped
in
one
after
the
other
till
the
little
room
was
quite
full
i
never
saw
such
astonishment
on
any
human
face
as
on
that
of
the
poor
master
of
the
house
who
could
not
stir
from
his
chair
by
the
fire
on
account
of
a
bad
wound
in
his
leg
from
an
axe
there
he
sat
quite
helpless
a
moment
ago
so
solitary
arid
now
finding
himself
the
centre
of
a
large
crowd
of
strangers
he
was
a
scotchman
probably
of
not
a
very
elevated
position
in
life
and
had
passed
many
years
in
this
lonely
spot
and
yet
he
showed
himself
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
after
that
first
uncontrollable
look
of
amazement
he
did
the
honours
of
his
poor
hut
with
the
utmost
courtesy
and
true
his
only
apology
was
for
being
unable
to
rise
from
his
made
out
of
half
a
barrel
and
an
old
by
the
way
he
made
us
perfectly
welcome
took
it
for
granted
we
were
hungry
hunger
is
a
very
mild
word
to
express
my
appetite
for
one
called
by
a
loud
to
his
man
sandy
to
whom
he
gave
orders
that
the
best
in
the
house
should
be
put
before
us
and
then
began
to
inquire
by
what
road
we
had
come
what
sport
we
had
all
in
the
nicest
way
possible
i
never
felt
more
awkward
in
my
life
than
when
i
stooped
to
enter
that
low
doorway
and
yet
in
a
minute
i
was
quite
at
my
ease
again
but
of
the
whole
party
i
was
naturally
the
one
who
puzzled
him
the
most
in
the
first
place
i
strongly
suspect
that
he
had
doubts
as
to
my
being
anything
but
a
boy
in
a
rather
long
kilt
and
when
this
point
was
explained
he
could
not
understand
what
a
female
as
he
also
called
me
was
doing
on
a
rough
hunting
expedition
he
particularly
inquired
more
than
once
if
i
had
come
of
my
own
free
will
and
could
not
understand
what
pleasure
i
found
in
walking
so
far
indeed
he
took
it
so
completely
for
granted
that
i
must
be
exhausted
that
he
immediately
began
to
make
plans
for
f
and
me
to
stop
there
all
night
offering
to
give
up
his
bunk
some
slabs
of
wood
made
into
a
shelf
with
a
tussock
mattress
and
a
blanket
and
to
sleep
himself
in
his
in
the
meantime
sandy
was
preparing
our
meal
there
was
an
open
hearth
with
a
fine
fire
and
a
big
black
kettle
hanging
over
it
by
a
hook
fastened
somewhere
up
the
chimney
as
soon
as
this
boiled
he
went
to
a
chest
or
rather
locker
and
brought
a
of
tea
which
he
threw
into
the
kettle
then
he
took
from
a
cupboard
the
biggest
loaf
of
bread
i
ever
saw
a
huge
thing
which
had
been
baked
in
a
and
flapped
it
down
on
the
table
with
a
bang
next
he
produced
a
tin
and
returned
to
the
cupboard
to
fetch
out
by
the
a
which
he
placed
in
the
a
bottle
of
capital
whisky
was
forthcoming
from
the
same
place
a
little
salt
on
one
newspaper
and
brown
or
rather
sugar
on
another
completed
the
arrangements
and
we
were
politely
told
by
sandy
to
wire
in
digger
phraseology
for
an
invitation
to
commence
which
we
did
immediately
as
soon
as
we
could
make
an
arrangement
about
the
four
tin
plates
and
three
pannikins
i
had
one
all
to
myself
but
the
others
managed
by
twos
and
threes
to
each
plate
i
never
had
a
better
luncheon
in
my
life
everything
was
excellent
in
its
way
and
we
all
possessed
what
we
are
told
is
the
best
sauce
large
as
the
supplies
were
we
left
hardly
anything
and
the
more
we
devoured
the
more
pleased
our
host
seemed
there
were
no
chairs
we
sat
on
logs
of
trees
rudely
chopped
into
something
like
but
to
tired
limbs
which
had
known
no
rest
from
six
hours
walking
they
seemed
delightful
after
we
had
finished
our
meal
the
gentlemen
went
outside
to
have
half
a
pipe
before
setting
off
again
they
dared
not
smoke
whilst
we
were
after
the
cattle
for
fear
of
their
perceiving
some
unusual
smell
and
i
remained
for
ten
minutes
with
mr
i
found
that
he
was
very
fond
of
reading
his
few
books
were
all
of
a
good
stamp
but
he
was
terribly
for
anything
which
he
had
not
read
a
hundred
times
over
i
hastily
ran
over
the
names
of
some
books
of
my
own
which
i
offered
to
lend
him
for
as
long
a
time
as
he
liked
and
we
made
elaborate
plans
for
sending
them
of
my
share
in
which
i
took
a
memorandum
he
seemed
very
grateful
at
the
prospect
of
having
anything
new
especially
now
that
he
was
likely
to
be
laid
up
for
some
weeks
and
i
intend
to
make
every
effort
to
give
him
this
great
pleasure
as
soon
as
possible
we
exchanged
the
most
hearty
farewells
when
the
time
of
parting
came
and
our
host
was
most
earnest
in
his
entreaties
to
us
to
remain
but
it
was
a
question
of
getting
out
of
the
bush
before
dusk
so
we
could
not
delay
he
sent
sandy
to
guide
us
by
a
rather
longer
but
easier
way
than
climbing
up
the
steep
cliff
to
the
place
where
the
little
clearing
at
its
edge
which
i
have
mentioned
had
been
made
and
we
dismissed
our
guide
quite
happy
with
contributions
from
all
the
for
no
one
had
any
money
with
him
we
found
our
way
back
again
by
the
notches
on
the
trees
as
long
as
the
light
lasted
and
when
it
got
too
dark
to
see
them
easily
the
smouldering
trunks
guided
us
and
we
reached
the
clearing
from
which
we
started
in
perfect
safety
good
d
had
a
bountiful
tea
ready
she
was
much
concerned
at
our
having
yet
some
three
miles
of
bad
walking
before
we
could
reach
the
hut
on
the
outskirts
of
the
bush
where
we
had
left
the
trap
and
the
ponies
when
we
got
to
this
point
there
was
actually
another
and
still
more
sumptuous
meal
set
out
for
us
to
which
alas
we
were
unable
to
do
any
justice
and
then
we
found
our
way
to
the
station
across
the
flat
down
a
steep
cutting
and
through
the
all
in
the
dark
and
cold
we
had
supper
as
soon
as
we
reached
home
tumbling
into
bed
as
early
as
might
be
afterwards
for
such
a
sleep
as
you
londoners
do
know
anything
about
i
have
only
described
one
expedition
to
you
and
that
the
most
unsuccessful
as
far
as
killing
anything
goes
but
my
hunting
instincts
only
lead
me
to
the
point
of
reaching
the
game
when
it
comes
to
that
i
always
try
to
save
its
life
and
if
this
ca
be
done
i
retire
to
a
distance
and
stop
my
ears
indeed
if
very
much
i
help
crying
consequently
i
enjoy
myself
much
more
when
we
do
kill
anything
and
on
the
other
occasions
i
never
could
stop
and
see
even
the
shot
fired
which
was
to
bring
a
fine
cow
or
a
dear
little
calf
down
but
crept
away
as
far
as
ever
i
could
and
muffled
my
head
in
my
jacket
the
bushmen
liked
this
part
of
the
performance
the
best
i
believe
and
acted
as
butchers
very
readily
taking
home
a
large
joint
each
to
their
huts
a
welcome
change
after
the
eternal
pigeons
and
wild
ducks
on
which
they
live
letter
xxii
the
exceeding
joy
of
burning
broomielaw
december
i
am
quite
sorry
that
the
season
for
setting
fire
to
the
long
grass
or
as
it
is
technically
called
burning
the
run
is
fairly
over
at
last
it
has
been
later
than
usual
this
year
on
account
of
the
snow
having
lain
such
an
unusual
time
on
the
ground
and
kept
the
grass
damp
generally
september
is
the
earliest
month
in
which
it
begins
and
november
the
latest
for
it
to
end
but
this
year
the
shady
side
of
flagpole
was
too
moist
to
take
fire
until
december
it
is
useless
to
think
of
setting
out
on
a
burning
expedition
unless
there
is
a
pretty
strong
blowing
but
it
must
not
be
violent
or
the
flames
will
fly
over
the
grass
just
scorching
it
instead
of
making
a
clean
burn
but
when
f
pronounces
the
wind
to
be
just
right
and
proposes
that
we
should
go
to
some
place
where
the
grass
is
of
two
or
still
better
three
years
growth
then
i
am
indeed
happy
i
am
obliged
to
be
careful
not
to
have
on
any
inflammable
petticoats
even
if
it
is
quite
a
warm
day
as
they
are
very
dangerous
the
wind
will
shift
suddenly
perhaps
as
i
am
in
the
very
act
of
setting
a
tussock
and
for
half
a
second
i
find
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
flames
f
generally
gets
his
beard
well
singed
and
i
have
nearly
lost
my
eyelashes
more
than
once
we
each
provide
ourselves
with
a
good
supply
of
matches
and
on
the
way
we
look
out
for
the
last
tall
blossom
of
those
horrid
prickly
bushes
called
spaniards
or
a
bundle
of
or
better
than
all
the
top
of
a
dead
and
dry
palm
as
soon
as
we
come
to
the
proper
spot
and
f
has
ascertained
that
no
sheep
are
in
danger
of
being
made
into
roast
mutton
before
their
time
we
begin
to
light
our
line
of
fire
setting
one
large
tussock
blazing
lighting
our
impromptu
torches
at
it
and
then
starting
from
this
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
dragging
the
blazing
sticks
along
the
grass
it
is
a
very
exciting
amusement
i
assure
you
and
the
effect
is
beautiful
especially
as
it
grows
dusk
and
the
fires
are
racing
up
the
hills
all
around
us
every
now
and
then
they
meet
with
a
puff
of
wind
which
will
perhaps
strike
a
great
wall
of
fire
rushing
as
straight
as
a
line
and
divide
it
into
two
fiery
horns
like
a
crescent
then
as
the
breeze
changes
again
the
tips
of
flame
will
gradually
approach
each
other
till
they
meet
and
go
on
again
in
a
solid
mass
of
fire
if
the
weather
has
been
very
dry
for
some
time
and
the
wind
is
high
we
attempt
to
burn
a
great
flax
swamp
perhaps
in
some
of
the
flats
this
makes
a
magnificent
bonfire
when
once
it
is
fairly
started
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
light
in
the
first
instance
as
you
have
to
collect
the
dead
and
make
a
little
fire
of
them
under
the
big
green
bush
in
order
to
coax
it
to
blaze
up
but
it
crackles
splendidly
indeed
it
sounds
as
if
small
explosions
were
going
on
sometimes
but
another
disadvantage
of
burning
a
swamp
is
that
there
are
deep
holes
every
yard
or
two
into
which
i
always
tumble
in
my
excitement
or
in
getting
out
of
the
way
of
a
which
has
flared
up
just
at
the
wrong
moment
and
is
threatening
to
set
me
on
fire
also
these
holes
are
quite
full
of
water
in
the
winter
but
now
they
contain
just
enough
thin
mud
to
come
in
over
the
tops
of
my
boots
so
i
do
not
like
stepping
into
one
every
moment
we
start
numerous
wild
ducks
and
and
perhaps
a
bittern
or
two
by
these
conflagrations
on
the
whole
i
like
burning
the
better
than
the
swamp
you
get
a
more
satisfactory
blaze
with
less
trouble
but
i
sigh
over
these
degenerate
days
when
the
grass
is
kept
short
and
a
third
part
of
a
run
is
burned
regularly
ever
spring
and
long
for
the
good
old
times
of
a
dozen
years
ago
when
the
tussocks
were
six
feet
high
what
a
blaze
they
must
have
made
the
immediate
results
of
our
expeditions
are
vast
tracts
of
perfectly
black
and
barren
country
looking
desolate
and
hideous
to
a
degree
hardly
to
be
imagined
but
after
the
first
spring
showers
a
beautiful
tender
green
tint
steals
over
the
bare
and
by
and
by
they
are
a
mass
of
delicious
young
grass
and
the
especial
favourite
of
the
ewes
and
lambs
the
day
after
a
good
burn
thousands
of
flock
to
the
black
ground
where
they
spring
from
i
can
not
tell
as
i
never
see
one
at
any
other
time
and
their
hoarse
incessant
cry
is
the
first
sign
you
have
of
their
arrival
they
hover
over
the
ground
every
moment
darting
down
for
some
insect
they
can
not
find
much
else
but
roasted
lizards
and
grasshoppers
for
i
have
never
seen
a
caterpillar
in
new
zealand
in
the
height
of
the
burning
season
last
month
i
had
alice
s
to
stay
with
me
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
to
my
great
delight
i
found
our
tastes
about
fires
agreed
exactly
and
we
both
had
the
same
grievance
that
we
never
were
allowed
to
have
half
enough
of
it
so
we
organized
the
most
delightful
expeditions
together
we
used
to
have
a
quiet
old
saddled
fasten
the
to
the
pommel
with
materials
for
a
five
tea
and
start
off
miles
away
to
the
back
of
the
run
about
three
in
the
afternoon
having
previously
bribed
the
shepherd
to
tell
us
where
the
longest
grass
was
to
be
found
and
this
he
did
very
readily
as
our
going
saved
him
the
trouble
of
a
journey
thither
and
he
was
not
at
all
anxious
for
more
work
than
he
could
help
we
used
to
ride
alternately
till
we
got
to
a
deserted
shepherd
hut
in
such
a
lovely
gully
quite
at
the
far
end
of
the
run
here
we
tied
up
dear
quiet
old
jack
to
the
remnants
of
the
fence
leaving
him
at
liberty
to
nibble
a
little
grass
we
never
took
off
the
saddle
after
the
first
time
for
upon
that
occasion
we
found
that
our
united
strength
was
insufficient
to
girth
it
on
again
properly
and
we
made
our
appearance
at
home
in
the
most
ignominious
fashion
alice
leading
jack
and
i
walking
by
his
side
holding
the
saddle
whenever
we
attempted
to
buckle
the
girths
this
artful
old
screw
swelled
himself
out
with
such
a
long
breath
that
it
was
impossible
to
pull
the
strap
to
the
proper
hole
we
could
not
even
get
it
tight
enough
to
stay
steady
without
slipping
under
him
at
every
step
however
this
is
a
digression
and
i
must
take
you
back
to
the
scene
of
the
fire
and
try
to
make
you
understand
how
delightful
it
was
alice
said
that
what
made
it
so
fascinating
to
her
was
a
certain
sense
of
its
being
mischief
and
a
dim
feeling
that
we
might
get
into
a
scrape
i
do
think
i
ever
stopped
to
analyse
my
sensations
fright
was
the
only
one
i
was
conscious
of
and
yet
i
liked
it
so
much
when
after
much
consultation
in
which
i
always
deferred
to
alice
superior
wisdom
and
experience
we
determined
on
our
line
of
fire
we
set
to
work
vigorously
and
the
great
thing
was
to
see
who
could
make
the
finest
blaze
i
used
to
feel
very
envious
if
my
fire
got
into
a
bare
patch
where
there
were
more
rocks
than
tussocks
and
languished
whilst
alice
was
roaring
and
rushing
up
a
hill
we
always
avoided
burning
where
a
grove
of
the
pretty
palms
grew
but
sometimes
there
would
be
one
or
two
on
a
growing
by
themselves
and
then
it
was
most
beautiful
to
see
them
burn
even
before
the
flames
reached
them
their
long
delicate
leaves
felt
the
wind
of
the
fire
and
shivered
piteously
then
the
dry
old
ones
at
the
base
of
the
stem
caught
the
first
spark
like
tinder
and
in
a
second
the
whole
palm
was
in
a
blaze
making
a
sort
of
heart
to
the
furnace
as
it
had
so
much
more
substance
than
the
grass
for
a
moment
or
two
the
poor
palm
would
bend
and
sway
tossing
its
leaves
like
fiery
plumes
in
the
air
and
then
it
was
reduced
to
a
black
stump
and
the
fire
swept
on
up
the
hill
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
we
never
knew
when
to
leave
off
and
come
home
we
would
pause
for
half
an
hour
and
boil
our
little
kettle
and
have
some
tea
and
cake
and
then
go
on
again
till
quite
late
getting
well
scolded
when
we
reached
home
at
last
and
as
black
as
little
one
evening
f
was
away
on
a
visit
of
two
nights
to
a
distant
friend
and
alice
and
i
determined
on
having
splendid
burns
in
his
absence
so
we
made
our
plans
and
everything
was
favourable
wind
and
all
we
enjoyed
ourselves
very
much
but
if
u
had
not
come
out
to
look
for
us
at
ten
at
night
and
traced
us
by
our
blazing
track
we
should
have
had
to
camp
out
for
we
had
no
idea
where
we
were
or
that
we
had
wandered
so
many
miles
from
home
nor
had
we
any
intention
of
returning
just
yet
we
were
very
much
ashamed
of
ourselves
upon
that
occasion
and
took
care
to
soften
the
story
considerably
before
it
reached
f
ears
the
next
day
however
much
i
may
rejoice
at
in
the
early
spring
as
aids
to
burning
the
run
i
find
them
a
great
hindrance
to
my
attempts
at
a
lawn
twice
have
we
had
the
ground
carefully
dug
up
and
prepared
twice
has
it
been
sown
with
the
best
english
seed
for
the
purpose
at
some
considerable
expense
then
has
come
much
toil
on
the
part
of
f
and
u
with
a
heavy
and
the
end
of
all
the
trouble
has
been
that
a
strong
has
blown
both
seed
and
soil
away
leaving
only
the
hard
i
wonder
whether
there
is
such
a
word
ground
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
it
really
was
all
clean
gone
as
children
say
until
a
month
or
two
after
the
first
venture
when
i
had
been
straining
my
eyes
and
exercising
my
imagination
all
in
vain
to
discover
a
blade
where
it
ought
to
have
been
but
had
remarked
in
one
of
my
walks
an
irregular
patch
of
nice
english
grass
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
down
the
flat
i
speculated
for
some
time
as
to
how
it
got
there
and
at
last
f
was
roused
from
his
reverie
and
said
coolly
oh
that
your
lawn
when
this
happens
twice
it
really
becomes
very
aggravating
there
are
the
croquet
things
lying
idle
in
the
verandah
year
after
year
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
they
are
likely
to
remain
unused
for
ever
before
i
close
my
letter
i
must
tell
you
of
an
adventure
i
have
had
with
a
wild
boar
which
was
really
dangerous
f
and
another
gentleman
were
riding
with
me
one
afternoon
in
a
very
lonely
gully
at
the
back
of
the
run
when
the
dogs
who
always
accompany
us
put
up
a
large
fierce
black
boar
out
of
some
thick
of
course
the
hunting
instinct
which
all
young
englishmen
possess
was
in
full
force
instantly
and
in
default
of
any
weapon
these
two
jumped
off
their
horses
and
picked
up
out
of
the
creek
close
by
the
largest
and
heaviest
stones
they
could
lift
i
disapproved
of
the
chase
under
the
circumstances
but
my
timid
remonstrances
were
not
even
heard
the
light
which
each
gentleman
carried
were
hastily
given
to
me
to
hold
and
in
addition
f
thrust
an
enormous
boulder
into
my
lap
saying
now
this
is
to
be
my
second
gun
so
keep
close
to
me
imagine
poor
me
therefore
with
all
three
whips
tucked
under
my
left
arm
whilst
with
my
right
i
tried
to
keep
the
big
stone
on
my
knee
miss
helen
all
the
time
capering
about
as
she
always
does
when
there
is
any
excitement
and
i
feeling
very
unequal
to
holding
her
back
from
joining
in
the
chase
too
ardently
for
she
always
likes
to
be
first
everywhere
which
is
not
at
all
my
sentiments
the
ground
was
as
rough
as
possible
the
creek
winding
about
necessitated
a
good
jump
every
few
yards
and
the
grass
was
so
long
and
thick
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
through
it
or
to
see
any
blind
creeks
or
other
pitfalls
to
burn
this
next
spring
the
pig
first
turned
to
bay
against
a
and
soon
disabled
the
dogs
you
can
not
think
what
a
formidable
weapon
a
wild
boar
tusk
is
the
least
touch
of
it
cuts
like
a
razor
and
they
are
so
swift
in
their
jerks
of
the
head
when
at
bay
that
in
a
second
they
will
rip
up
both
dogs
and
horses
nor
are
they
the
least
afraid
of
attacking
a
man
on
foot
in
but
they
seldom
or
ever
strike
the
first
blow
as
soon
as
he
had
disposed
of
both
the
dogs
who
lay
howling
piteously
and
bleeding
on
the
ground
the
boar
made
at
full
speed
for
the
spur
of
a
hill
close
by
the
pace
was
too
good
to
last
especially
so
the
gentlemen
soon
caught
him
up
and
flung
their
stones
at
him
but
they
dared
not
bring
their
valuable
horses
too
near
for
fear
of
a
wound
which
probably
would
have
lamed
them
for
life
and
a
heavy
rock
or
stone
is
a
very
unmanageable
weapon
i
was
not
therefore
at
all
surprised
to
see
that
both
shots
missed
or
only
very
slightly
grazed
the
pig
but
what
i
confess
to
being
perfectly
unprepared
for
was
the
boar
charging
violently
on
poor
unoffending
me
with
his
head
on
one
side
ready
for
the
fatal
backward
jerk
champing
and
foaming
as
he
came
with
what
weller
would
call
his
vicked
old
eye
twinkling
with
rage
helen
could
not
realize
the
situation
at
all
i
tried
to
turn
her
and
so
get
out
of
the
infuriated
brute
way
but
no
she
would
press
on
to
meet
him
and
join
the
other
horses
at
the
top
of
the
hill
i
had
very
little
control
over
her
for
i
was
so
laden
with
whips
and
stones
that
my
hands
were
useless
for
the
reins
i
knew
i
was
in
great
danger
but
at
the
moment
i
could
only
think
of
my
poor
pretty
mare
lamed
for
life
or
even
perhaps
killed
on
the
spot
i
heard
one
wild
shout
of
warning
from
above
and
i
knew
the
others
were
galloping
to
my
rescue
but
in
certainly
less
than
half
a
minute
from
the
time
the
boar
turned
he
had
reached
me
i
slipped
the
reins
over
my
left
elbow
so
as
to
leave
my
hands
free
took
my
whip
in
my
teeth
i
had
to
drop
the
others
and
lifting
the
heavy
stone
with
both
my
hands
waited
a
second
till
the
boar
was
near
enough
leaning
well
over
on
the
side
of
the
saddle
so
as
to
see
what
he
did
he
made
for
poor
helen
near
with
his
head
well
down
and
i
could
hear
his
teeth
gnashing
just
as
he
touched
her
with
a
prick
from
his
tusk
like
a
stiletto
and
before
he
could
jerk
his
head
back
so
as
to
rip
the
leg
up
i
flung
my
small
rock
with
all
the
strength
i
possessed
crash
on
his
head
but
i
could
not
take
a
good
aim
for
the
moment
helen
felt
the
stab
she
reared
straight
up
on
her
and
as
we
were
going
i
had
some
trouble
to
keep
myself
from
slipping
off
over
her
tail
however
my
rock
took
some
effect
for
the
pig
was
so
stunned
that
he
dropped
on
his
knees
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
helen
had
turned
round
still
on
her
as
on
a
pivot
and
was
plunging
and
jumping
madly
down
the
hill
i
could
not
get
back
properly
into
my
saddle
nor
could
i
arrange
the
reins
so
i
had
to
stick
on
anyhow
it
was
not
a
case
of
fine
riding
at
all
i
merely
clung
like
a
monkey
and
f
who
was
coming
as
fast
as
he
could
to
me
said
he
expected
to
see
me
on
the
ground
every
moment
but
however
i
did
not
come
off
upon
that
occasion
helen
was
nearly
beside
herself
with
terror
i
tried
to
pat
her
neck
and
soothe
her
but
the
moment
she
felt
my
hand
she
bounded
as
if
i
had
struck
her
and
shivered
so
much
that
i
thought
she
must
be
injured
so
the
moment
f
could
get
near
her
i
begged
him
to
look
at
her
fetlock
he
led
her
down
to
the
creek
and
washed
the
place
and
examined
it
carefully
pronouncing
to
my
great
joy
that
the
tusk
had
hardly
gone
in
at
all
in
fact
had
merely
pricked
her
and
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
hurt
i
could
hardly
get
the
gentlemen
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
poor
dogs
one
of
which
was
very
much
hurt
both
f
and
b
evidently
thought
i
must
have
been
kilt
intirely
for
my
situation
looked
so
critical
at
one
moment
that
they
could
scarcely
be
persuaded
that
neither
helen
nor
i
were
in
the
least
hurt
i
coaxed
f
that
evening
to
write
me
a
doggerel
version
of
the
story
for
the
little
boys
which
i
send
you
to
show
them
anne

the

would

days

but
or
else
she
had

now
and
then
went
out
it
chanced
with

knights
at
her
stirrup
she
swept
the
grass
of
the
valleys
heard
the
brooks
run
and
heard
the
birds
chirrup
when
a
boar
from
the
sallies
the
cavaliers
leaped
from
their
horses
as
for
weapons
that
day
neither
bore
them
so
they
chose
from
the
swift
watercourses
heavy
boulders
and
held
them
before
them
they
gave
one
as
well
to
the
lady
she
took
it
and
placed
it
undaunted
on
the
pommel
and
balanced
it
steady
while
they
searched
where
the
animal
haunted
a
bowshot
beyond
her
were
riding
the
knights
each
alert
with
his
missile
but
in
doubt
where
the
pig
went
for
they
had
not
kept
sight
of
his
bristle
when
the
tale
needs
but
little
enlarging
one
turned
round
by
chance
on
his
courser
to
his
horror
the
monster
was
charging
at
the
lady
as
if
to
unhorse
her
but
his
fears
for
her
safety
were
idle
no
heart
of
a
hero
beat
stouter
she
poised
the
stone
gathered
her
bridle
a
halo
is
said
shone
about
her
with
his
jaws
all
extended
and
horrid
fierce
and
foaming
the
brute
leapt
to
gore
her
when
she
dropped
the
rock
full
on
his
forehead
and
lo
he
fell
dying
before
her
there
he
lay
bristling
tusky
and
savage
such
a
mouth
as
was
long
ago
written
made
calydon
lonely
with
ravage
by
such
teeth
young

bitten
then
praise
to

be
brought

whose
skill
and
whose
strength
did
not
want

to
finish
the
slaughter
she
is

and
new

shall
take
her
thrice
blest
to
possess
such

concerning
a

broomielaw
february
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
we
have
been
nearly
washed
away
by
all
the
creeks
and
rivers
in
the
country
overflowing
their
banks
christchurch
particularly
was
in
great
danger
from
the
chance
of
the
waimakiriri
returning
to
its
old
channel
in
which
case
it
would
sweep
away
the
town
for
several
hours
half
the
streets
were
under
water
the
people
going
about
in
boats
and
the
avon
was
spread
out
like
a
lake
over
its
banks
for
miles
the
weather
had
been
unusually
sultry
for
some
weeks
and
during
the
last
five
days
the
heat
had
been
far
greater
even
in
the
hills
than
anyone
could
remember
it
is
often
very
hot
indeed
during
the
hours
in
summer
but
a
hot
night
is
almost
unknown
and
at
the
elevation
we
live
there
are
few
evenings
in
the
year
when
a
is
not
acceptable
after
sunset
as
for
a
blanket
at
night
that
is
seldom
left
off
even
in
the
plains
and
is
certainly
necessary
in
the
hills
every
one
was
anxiously
looking
for
rain
as
the
grass
was
getting
very
dry
and
the
creeks
low
and
people
were
beginning
to
talk
of
an
australian
summer
and
to
prophesy
dismal
things
of
a
drought
on
a
sunday
night
about
eleven
we
were
all
sauntering
about
out
of
doors
finding
it
too
hot
to
remain
in
the
verandah
it
was
useless
to
think
of
going
to
bed
and
f
and
u
agreed
that
some
great
change
in
the
weather
was
near
there
was
a
strange
stillness
and
oppression
in
the
air
the
very
animals
had
not
gone
to
sleep
but
all
seemed
as
restless
and
wakeful
as
we
were
i
remember
we
discussed
the
probability
of
a
severe
earthquake
for
the
recent
wave
at
thomas
was
in
everybody
mind
f
and
i
had
spent
a
few
days
in
christchurch
the
week
before
there
was
a
regular
epidemic
there
and
he
had
returned
to
the
station
feeling
very
unwell
but
in
this
country
illness
is
so
rare
that
one
almost
forgets
that
such
a
thing
exists
and
we
both
attributed
his
seediness
to
the
extraordinary
heat
when
we
were
out
of
doors
that
sunday
evening
we
noticed
immense
banks
and
masses
of
clouds
but
they
were
not
in
the
quarter
from
whence
our
usual
heavy
rain
comes
and
besides
in
new
zealand
clouds
are
more
frequently
a
sign
of
high
wind
than
of
rain
however
about
midnight
f
felt
so
ill
that
he
went
in
to
bed
and
we
had
scarcely
got
under
shelter
when
after
a
very
few
premonitory
drops
the
rain
came
down
literally
in
sheets
almost
from
the
first
f
spoke
of
the
peculiar
and
different
sound
on
the
roof
but
as
he
had
a
great
deal
of
fever
that
night
i
was
too
anxious
to
notice
anything
but
the
welcome
fact
that
the
rain
had
come
at
last
and
too
glad
to
hear
it
to
be
critical
about
the
sound
it
made
in
falling
i
came
out
to
breakfast
alone
leaving
f
still
ill
but
the
fever
going
off
the
atmosphere
was
much
lightened
but
the
rain
seemed
like
a
solid
wall
of
water
falling
fast
and
furiously
the
noise
on
the
wooden
roof
was
so
great
that
we
had
to
shout
to
each
other
to
make
ourselves
heard
and
when
i
looked
out
i
was
astonished
to
see
the
dimensions
to
which
the
ponds
had
swollen
down
all
the
new
creeks
and
waterfalls
had
sprung
into
existence
during
the
night
as
soon
as
i
had
taken
f
his
tea
and
settled
down
comfortably
to
breakfast
i
noticed
that
instead
of
u
looking
the
picture
of
bright
he
wore
a
troubled
and
anxious
countenance
i
immediately
inquired
if
he
had
been
out
of
doors
that
morning
yes
he
had
been
to
look
at
the
horses
in
the
stable
well
i
did
not
feel
much
interest
in
them
for
they
were
big
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves
so
i
proceeded
to
ask
if
he
had
chanced
to
see
anything
of
my
fifty
young
ducks
or
my
numerous
broods
of
chickens
upon
this
question
u
looked
still
more
unhappy
and
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
but
my
suspicions
were
aroused
and
i
persisted
so
at
last
he
broke
to
me
with
much
precaution
that
i
was
absolutely
without
a
duckling
or
a
chicken
in
the
world
they
had
been
drowned
in
the
night
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
countless
draggled
little
corpses
what
mantilini
called
moist
unpleasant
bodies
floating
on
the
pond
or
whirling
in
the
eddies
of
the
creek
that
was
not
even
the
worst
every
one
of
my
sitting
hens
was
drowned
also
their
nests
washed
away
so
were
the
beautiful
ducks
with
some
twelve
or
fourteen
eggs
under
each
i
felt
angry
with
the
ducks
and
thought
they
might
have
at
any
rate
saved
their
own
lives
but
nothing
could
alter
the
melancholy
returns
of
the
missing
and
dead
my
was
for
all
practical
purposes
annihilated
just
as
it
was
at
its
greatest
perfection
and
the
pride
and
joy
of
my
heart
all
that
day
the
rain
descended
steadily
in
torrents
there
was
not
the
slightest
break
or
variation
in
the
downpour
it
was
as
heavy
as
that
of
the
jamaica
of
may
and
october
f
fever
left
him
at
the
end
of
twelve
hours
and
he
got
up
and
came
into
the
his
first
glance
out
of
the
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
flat
for
two
or
three
miles
showed
him
how
much
the
waters
had
risen
since
midnight
and
he
said
that
in
all
the
years
he
had
known
those
particular
creeks
he
had
never
seen
them
so
high
still
i
thought
nothing
of
it
there
was
no
cessation
in
the
rain
for
exactly
hours
but
at
midnight
on
monday
just
as
poor
f
was
getting
another
attack
of
fever
it
changed
into
heavy
broken
showers
with
little
pauses
of
fine
drizzle
between
and
by
morning
it
showed
signs
of
clearing
but
continued
at
intervals
till
midday
the
effect
was
extraordinary
considering
the
comparatively
short
time
the
real
downpour
had
lasted
the
whole
flat
was
under
water
the
creeks
were
flooded
beyond
their
banks
for
half
a
mile
or
so
on
each
side
and
the
river
selwyn
which
ran
under
some
hills
bounding
our
view
was
spread
out
forming
an
enormous
lake
a
very
conspicuous
object
on
these
opposite
hills
which
are
between
three
and
four
miles
distant
was
a
bold
cliff
known
by
the
name
of
the
white
rocks
and
serving
as
a
landmark
to
all
the
countryside
we
could
hardly
believe
our
eyes
when
we
missed
the
most
prominent
of
these
and
could
see
only
a
great
bare
rent
in
the
mountain
the
house
was
quite
surrounded
by
water
and
stood
on
a
small
island
it
was
impossible
even
to
wade
for
more
than
a
few
yards
beyond
the
dry
ground
for
the
water
became
quite
deep
and
the
current
was
running
fast
f
fever
lasted
its
twelve
hours
but
i
began
to
be
fidgety
at
the
state
of
prostration
it
left
him
in
and
when
tuesday
night
brought
a
third
and
sharper
attack
i
determined
to
make
him
go
to
town
and
see
a
doctor
during
his
next
interval
of
freedom
from
it
wednesday
morning
was
bright
and
sunny
but
the
waters
had
not
much
diminished
however
we
knew
every
hour
must
lessen
them
and
i
only
waited
for
f
paroxysm
of
fever
to
subside
about
to
send
him
off
to
christchurch
i
had
exhausted
my
simple
remedies
consisting
of
a
spoonful
of
sweet
spirits
of
nitre
and
a
little
weak
brandy
and
water
and
did
not
think
it
right
to
let
things
go
on
in
this
way
without
advice
he
was
so
weak
he
could
hardly
mount
his
horse
indeed
he
had
to
be
fairly
lifted
on
the
old
quiet
station
hack
i
have
before
mentioned
with
such
deep
affection
dear
old
jack
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
alone
so
the
and
considerate
u
offered
to
accompany
him
this
was
the
greatest
comfort
to
me
though
i
and
my
two
maids
would
be
left
all
alone
during
their
absence
however
that
was
much
better
than
poor
f
going
by
himself
in
his
weak
state
six
hours
of
sunshine
had
greatly
abated
the
floods
and
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
water
was
quite
shallow
now
where
it
had
overflowed
i
saw
them
set
off
therefore
with
a
good
hope
of
their
accomplishing
the
journey
safely
judge
of
my
astonishment
and
horror
when
on
going
to
see
what
the
dogs
were
barking
at
about
two
hours
later
i
beheld
f
and
u
at
the
garden
gate
dripping
wet
up
to
their
shoulders
but
laughing
very
much
of
course
i
immediately
thought
of
f
fever
and
made
him
come
in
and
change
and
have
some
hot
tea
directly
but
he
would
not
go
to
bed
as
i
suggested
declaring
that
the
shock
of
his
unexpected
cold
bath
and
the
excitement
of
a
swim
for
his
life
had
done
him
all
the
good
in
the
world
and
i
may
tell
you
at
once
that
it
had
completely
cured
him
he
ate
well
that
evening
slept
well
and
had
no
return
of
his
fever
regaining
his
strength
completely
in
a
few
days
so
much
for
remedies
it
seems
that
as
soon
as
they
neared
the
first
creek
with
very
high
banks
about
a
mile
from
the
house
the
water
came
up
to
the
fetlocks
then
to
their
knees
but
still
it
was
impossible
to
tell
exactly
where
the
creek
began
or
rather
where
its
bank
ended
they
went
very
cautiously
steering
as
well
as
they
could
for
where
they
imagined
the
cutting
in
the
steep
bank
to
be
but
i
suppose
they
did
not
hit
it
off
exactly
for
suddenly
they
went
plump
into
deep
water
and
found
themselves
whirling
along
like
straws
down
a
tremendous
current
jack
was
however
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
he
never
allows
himself
to
be
flurried
or
put
out
by
anything
and
has
i
imagine
been
in
nearly
every
difficulty
incident
to
new
zealand
travelling
instead
therefore
of
losing
his
head
as
helen
did
u
was
riding
her
and
striking
out
wildly
with
her
forelegs
to
the
great
danger
of
the
other
horse
jack
took
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
and
set
himself
to
swim
steadily
down
the
stream
avoiding
the
eddies
as
much
as
possible
he
knew
every
yard
of
the
bank
and
did
not
therefore
waste
his
strength
by
trying
to
land
in
impossible
places
but
kept
a
watchful
eye
for
the
easiest
spot
f
knew
the
old
horse
so
well
that
he
let
him
have
his
head
and
guide
himself
only
trying
to
avoid
helen
forelegs
which
were
often
unpleasantly
near
his
only
fear
was
lest
they
should
have
to
go
so
far
before
a
landing
was
possible
that
poor
old
jack
strength
might
not
hold
out
for
there
is
nothing
so
fatiguing
to
a
horse
as
swimming
in
a
strong
current
with
a
rider
on
his
back
especially
a
heavy
man
they
were
swept
down
for
a
long
distance
though
it
was
impossible
to
guess
exactly
how
far
they
had
gone
and
f
was
getting
very
uneasy
about
a
certain
wire
fence
which
had
been
carried
across
the
creek
they
were
rapidly
approaching
it
and
the
danger
was
that
the
horses
might
suddenly
find
themselves
entangled
in
it
in
which
case
the
riders
would
very
likely
have
been
drowned
f
called
to
u
to
get
his
feet
free
from
the
stirrups
and
loosened
his
own
but
he
told
me
he
was
afraid
lest
u
should
not
hear
him
above
the
roaring
of
the
water
and
so
perhaps
be
dragged
under
water
when
the
fence
was
reached
however
jack
knew
all
about
it
and
was
not
going
to
be
drowned
ignominiously
in
a
creek
which
would
not
have
wet
his
hoofs
to
cross
three
days
before
a
few
yards
from
the
fence
he
made
one
rush
and
a
bound
towards
what
seemed
only
a
clump
of
tohi
bushes
but
they
broke
the
force
of
the
current
and
gave
him
the
chance
he
wanted
and
he
struggled
up
the
high
crumbling
bank
more
like
a
cat
than
a
steady
old
screw
helen
would
not
be
left
behind
and
with
a
good
spur
from
u
she
followed
jack
example
and
they
stood
dripping
and
shivering
in
shallow
water
both
the
horses
were
so
that
f
and
u
had
to
jump
off
instantly
and
loose
the
girths
turning
them
with
their
nostrils
to
the
wind
it
was
a
very
narrow
escape
and
the
disagreeable
part
of
it
was
that
they
had
scrambled
out
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
creek
and
had
to
recross
it
to
get
home
however
they
rode
on
to
the
next
stream
which
looked
so
much
more
swollen
and
angry
that
they
gave
up
the
idea
of
going
on
to
christchurch
that
night
especially
as
they
were
wet
through
to
their
chins
for
both
horses
swam
very
low
in
the
water
with
only
their
heads
to
be
seen
above
it
the
next
thing
to
be
considered
was
how
to
get
back
to
the
house
it
never
would
do
to
risk
taking
the
horses
into
danger
again
when
they
were
so
exhausted
so
they
rode
round
by
the
homestead
crossed
the
creek
higher
up
where
it
was
much
wider
but
comparatively
shallow
if
anything
could
be
called
shallow
just
now
and
came
home
over
the
hills
good
old
jack
had
an
extra
feed
of
oats
that
evening
a
reward
to
which
he
is
by
no
means
insensible
and
indeed
it
probably
is
the
only
one
he
cares
for
the
fates
had
determined
apparently
that
i
also
should
come
in
for
my
share
of
watery
adventures
for
we
had
an
engagement
of
rather
long
standing
to
ride
across
the
hills
and
visit
a
friend
station
about
twelve
miles
distant
and
the
day
we
had
promised
to
go
was
rather
more
than
a
week
after
f
attempted
journey
in
the
meantime
the
waters
had
of
course
gone
down
considerably
and
there
was
quite
an
excitement
in
riding
and
walking
about
our
own
run
and
seeing
the
changes
the
flood
had
made
and
the
mischief
it
had
done
to
the
fencing
this
was
in
process
of
being
repaired
we
lost
very
few
sheep
they
were
all
up
at
the
tops
of
the
high
hills
their
favourite
summer
pasture
i
think
i
have
told
you
that
between
us
and
christchurch
there
is
but
one
river
a
most
peaceable
and
orderly
stream
a
perfect
pattern
to
the
eccentric
new
zealand
rivers
which
are
so
changeable
and
restless
upon
this
occasion
however
the
selwyn
behaved
quite
as
badly
as
any
of
its
fellows
it
was
not
only
flooded
for
miles
carrying
away
quantities
of
fencing
near
its
banks
and
drowning
confiding
sheep
suddenly
but
at
one
spot
about
four
miles
from
us
just
under
the
white
rocks
it
came
down
suddenly
like
what
miss
ingelow
calls
a
mighty
eygre
and
deserted
its
old
timeworn
bed
for
two
new
ones
and
the
worst
of
the
story
is
that
it
has
taken
a
fancy
to
our
road
swept
away
a
good
deal
of
it
breaking
a
course
for
itself
in
quite
a
different
place
so
now
instead
of
one
nice
wide
generally
shallow
river
to
cross
about
which
there
never
has
been
an
evil
report
we
have
two
horrid
mountain
torrents
of
which
we
know
nothing
no
one
has
been
in
yet
to
try
their
depth
or
to
find
out
the
best
place
at
which
to
ford
them
and
it
unfortunately
happened
that
f
and
i
were
the
pioneers
when
we
came
to
the
first
new
channel
f
with
much
care
picked
out
what
seemed
the
best
place
and
though
it
was
a
most
disagreeable
bit
of
water
to
go
through
still
we
managed
it
all
right
but
when
we
came
to
the
next
curve
it
was
far
worse
here
the
river
took
a
sharp
turn
and
came
tearing
round
a
corner
the
colour
and
consistency
of
and
making
such
a
noise
we
could
hardly
hear
ourselves
speak
standing
close
together
on
the
bank
once
in
the
stream
of
course
it
would
be
hopeless
to
try
to
catch
a
word
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
my
fixed
idea
was
to
turn
back
and
this
i
proposed
without
hesitation
but
f
has
the
greatest
dislike
to
retracing
his
steps
and
is
disagreeably
like
excelsior
in
this
respect
so
he
merely
looked
astonished
at
my
want
of
spirit
and
proceeded
very
calmly
to
give
me
my
directions
and
the
more
he
impressed
the
necessity
of
coolness
and
caution
upon
me
the
more
i
quaked
he
was
to
go
over
first
alone
i
was
to
follow
having
first
tucked
my
habit
well
up
under
my
arm
and
taken
care
that
i
was
quite
free
so
as
not
to
be
entangled
in
any
way
helen
should
be
swept
away
or
if
a
boulder
should
come
down
with
the
stream
and
knock
her
feet
from
under
her
i
was
not
to
be
at
all
frightened
and
i
was
to
keep
my
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
guide
helen
head
exactly
by
the
motion
of
his
hand
he
plunged
into
the
water
as
soon
as
he
had
issued
these
encouraging
directions
i
saw
him
floundering
in
and
out
of
several
deep
holes
and
presently
he
got
safe
to
land
dripping
wet
then
he
dismounted
tied
leo
to
a
flax
bush
and
took
off
his
coat
and
big
i
thought
very
naturally
to
dry
them
but
i
should
have
been
still
more
alarmed
if
possible
had
i
known
that
this
was
to
prepare
to
be
ready
to
swim
to
my
help
in
case
of
danger
as
it
was
my
only
hope
was
that
helen
might
not
like
the
look
of
the
angry
flood
and
would
refuse
to
go
in
how
i
should
have
blessed
her
for
such
obstinacy
but
no
she
was
eager
to
rejoin
her
stable
companion
and
plunged
in
without
hesitation
i
found
it
much
worse
even
than
i
dreaded
the
water
felt
so
resistless
as
if
it
sweep
me
right
out
of
the
saddle
i
should
like
to
have
clutched
helen
mane
or
anything
to
have
kept
me
on
but
both
hands
were
wanted
to
hold
the
reins
quite
low
down
one
on
each
side
of
her
withers
so
as
to
guide
her
exactly
according
to
f
on
the
opposite
bank
steering
implicitly
by
this
i
escaped
the
holes
and
rocks
which
he
had
come
against
and
got
over
safely
but
trembling
and
with
chattering
teeth
f
said
quite
disdainfully
you
do
mean
to
say
really
frightened
so
then
i
scolded
him
rather
incoherently
and
demanded
to
be
praised
for
coming
at
all
i
wrung
my
habit
out
as
well
as
i
could
f
poured
the
water
out
of
his
boots
and
we
proceeded
first
over
a
plain
and
then
to
climb
a
high
steep
hill
i
wonder
if
you
have
any
idea
how
disagreeable
and
dangerous
it
is
to
go
zigzag
up
the
side
of
a
mountain
after
such
rain
as
we
have
had
the
soil
was
just
like
soap
nothing
for
the
horses
hoofs
to
take
hold
of
not
a
pebble
or
a
tuft
of
grass
all
had
been
washed
away
and
only
the
slippery
clay
remained
as
usual
f
went
first
and
i
followed
taking
care
not
to
keep
below
him
lest
he
and
leo
should
come
slithering
that
is
the
only
word
for
it
down
upon
me
but
alas
it
was
helen
and
i
who
slithered
poor
dear
all
her
legs
seemed
to
fly
from
under
her
at
once
and
she
came
down
on
her
side
and
on
my
legs
i
felt
the
snap
and
found
my
left
shoulder
against
the
ground
i
let
go
the
reins
and
thought
we
had
better
part
company
but
found
i
could
not
move
for
her
weight
struggled
to
get
up
and
we
both
slipped
down
down
down
there
was
no
reason
why
we
should
not
have
gone
on
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
when
a
friendly
tussock
afforded
her
an
for
her
hind
hoofs
and
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
like
a
cat
i
found
myself
still
on
her
back
so
i
picked
up
my
reins
and
tried
to
pretend
that
i
had
never
thought
of
getting
off
f
dared
not
stir
from
his
bad
eminence
so
helen
and
i
wended
our
slippery
way
up
to
him
and
in
answer
to
his
horrified
where
is
your
habit
i
found
i
was
torn
to
ribbons
in
fact
my
skirt
was
little
more
than
a
kilt
and
a
very
short
one
too
what
was
to
be
done
we
were
only
three
or
four
miles
from
our
destination
so
we
pushed
on
and
at
the
last
i
lingered
behind
and
made
f
go
first
and
borrow
a
cloak
or
shawl
you
would
have
laughed
if
you
had
heard
my
pathetic
adjurations
to
him
to
be
sure
to
bring
it
by
himself
i
was
so
afraid
that
some
one
else
would
politely
insist
on
accompanying
him
but
it
was
all
right
though
even
with
this
assistance
it
was
very
difficult
to
arrange
matters
so
as
to
be
tolerably
respectable
my
hostess
was
shocked
at
my
tattered
wet
plight
and
dried
me
and
dressed
me
up
till
i
was
quite
smart
and
then
we
had
a
very
pleasant
day
and
best
of
all
came
home
by
a
different
road
so
as
to
avoid
the
slippery
descent
and
the
rivers
in
the
dark
but
i
still
mourn
for
my
habit
was
my
last
three
have
disappeared
owing
to
unfortunate
accidents
this
year
and
now
i
am
reduced
to
what
can
be
contrived
out
of
a
linsey
dress
letter
xxiv
my
only
fall
from
horseback
broomielaw
june
the
autumn
has
passed
away
so
quickly
that
i
can
hardly
believe
the
winter
has
reached
us
so
soon
the
last
winter
we
shall
spend
in
new
zealand
i
should
like
to
have
been
able
to
boast
on
my
return
to
england
that
in
three
years
constant
riding
on
all
sorts
of
horses
good
bad
and
indifferent
and
over
abominable
roads
i
had
escaped
a
fall
but
not
only
have
i
had
a
very
severe
one
but
it
was
from
my
own
favourite
helen
which
is
very
trying
to
reflect
upon
however
it
was
not
in
the
least
her
fault
or
mine
either
so
she
and
i
are
still
perfectly
good
friends
we
had
been
spending
two
days
up
at
lake
coleridge
as
a
sort
of
farewell
visit
and
on
our
way
down
again
to
rockwood
a
distance
of
about
twenty
miles
we
stopped
to
lunch
by
invitation
at
a
station
midway
there
was
so
much
to
be
seen
at
this
place
that
we
loitered
much
longer
than
was
prudent
in
the
short
days
and
by
the
time
we
had
thoroughly
inspected
a
beautiful
new
with
all
the
latest
improvements
from
which
f
could
hardly
tear
himself
away
the
elaborately
arranged
for
the
reception
of
the
young
trout
expected
from
tasmania
and
the
charming
garden
well
sheltered
by
a
grove
of
large
it
was
growing
dusk
and
we
prepared
to
push
on
as
fast
as
possible
for
nothing
is
more
disagreeable
than
being
caught
in
the
dark
on
a
new
zealand
track
with
its
creeks
and
swamps
and
wire
fences
the
last
are
the
most
dangerous
obstacles
if
you
get
off
the
track
or
if
the
gate
through
the
fence
has
been
placed
for
convenience
a
few
yards
on
one
side
of
it
the
horses
can
not
see
the
slender
wires
in
the
dark
and
so
fall
over
them
injuring
themselves
and
their
riders
most
seriously
sometimes
having
still
about
eight
miles
to
go
we
were
galloping
gaily
over
a
wide
open
plain
our
only
anxiety
arising
from
the
fast
failing
daylight
but
the
horses
were
still
quite
fresh
and
as
the
french
idiom
would
have
it
devoured
the
ground
at
a
fine
pace
when
in
an
instant
the
ground
appeared
to
rise
up
to
meet
me
and
i
found
myself
dragged
along
on
the
extreme
point
of
my
right
shoulder
still
grasping
both
reins
and
whip
i
was
almost
under
the
feet
of
the
other
horse
and
i
saw
helen
heels
describing
frantic
circles
in
the
air
f
shouted
to
me
to
let
go
which
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
to
do
previously
i
did
so
and
jumped
up
instantly
feeling
quite
unhurt
and
rather
relieved
to
find
that
a
fall
was
not
so
dreadful
after
all
i
then
saw
the
cause
of
the
accident
the
handle
of
a
little
which
had
been
hung
over
the
pommel
of
my
saddle
had
slipped
over
the
slight
projection
and
as
it
was
still
further
secured
by
a
strap
through
the
girth
it
was
dangling
under
poor
helen
whose
frantic
bounds
and
leaps
only
increased
the
liveliness
of
her
tormentor
i
never
saw
such
bucks
and
jumps
high
into
the
air
as
she
performed
receiving
a
severe
blow
from
the
bag
at
each
it
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
though
i
did
not
see
how
it
was
all
to
end
she
would
not
allow
f
to
approach
her
and
was
perfectly
mad
with
terror
at
last
the
girths
gave
way
and
the
saddle
came
off
with
the
bag
still
fastened
to
it
the
moment
she
found
herself
free
she
trotted
up
to
me
in
the
most
engaging
manner
and
stood
rubbing
her
nose
against
my
arm
though
she
was
still
trembling
all
over
and
covered
with
foam
by
this
time
i
had
made
the
discovery
that
i
could
not
raise
my
right
arm
but
still
a
careful
investigation
did
not
tell
me
it
was
broken
for
it
gave
me
no
pain
to
touch
anywhere
except
a
very
little
just
on
the
point
of
the
shoulder
f
now
went
to
pick
up
the
saddle
and
the
reins
it
was
difficult
to
find
these
latter
in
the
fast
gathering
darkness
and
i
held
his
horse
for
him
to
my
horror
i
found
after
standing
for
a
moment
or
two
that
i
was
going
to
faint
i
could
not
utter
a
word
i
knew
that
if
my
fingers
let
go
their
hold
of
the
bridle
the
horse
would
set
off
towards
home
at
a
gallop
helen
would
assuredly
follow
him
and
we
should
be
left
eight
miles
from
the
nearest
shelter
to
find
our
way
to
it
with
a
deep
creek
to
cross
f
was
fifty
yards
off
with
his
back
to
me
searching
for
some
indispensable
buckle
so
there
was
no
help
to
be
got
from
him
at
the
moment
i
exerted
every
atom
of
my
remaining
strength
to
slip
the
bridle
over
my
left
arm
which
i
pressed
against
my
waist
then
i
sat
down
as
quietly
as
i
could
not
to
alarm
the
horse
bent
forward
so
as
to
keep
my
left
arm
under
me
lest
the
bridle
should
slip
off
and
fainted
away
in
great
peace
and
comfort
the
cold
was
becoming
so
intense
that
it
soon
revived
me
and
f
suspecting
something
was
wrong
came
to
relieve
me
of
the
care
of
the
horse
and
contrived
to
get
the
girths
repaired
with
the
flax
and
the
bag
secured
in
a
very
short
time
but
when
it
came
to
mounting
again
that
was
not
so
easy
every
time
i
tried
to
spring
something
jarred
horribly
in
the
socket
where
the
arm
fits
into
the
shoulder
and
the
pain
was
so
great
that
i
had
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
it
was
now
nearly
seven
quite
dark
and
freezing
hard
we
were
most
anxious
to
get
on
and
yet
what
was
to
be
done
i
could
not
mount
apparently
and
there
was
no
stone
or
bank
to
stand
on
and
get
up
by
for
an
immense
way
at
last
f
put
me
up
by
sheer
strength
i
found
myself
so
deadly
sick
and
faint
when
i
was
fairly
in
the
saddle
that
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
allow
helen
to
move
and
never
shall
i
forget
the
torture
of
her
first
step
for
my
shoulder
was
now
stiffening
in
a
most
unpleasant
way
f
said
it
would
be
easier
to
canter
so
we
set
off
at
full
speed
and
the
cold
air
against
my
face
kept
me
from
fainting
as
we
went
along
though
i
fully
expected
to
fall
off
every
moment
if
helen
had
shied
or
stumbled
or
even
capered
a
little
i
should
have
been
on
the
ground
again
in
my
torture
and
despair
i
proposed
to
be
left
behind
and
for
f
to
ride
on
and
get
help
but
he
would
not
hear
of
this
declaring
that
i
should
die
of
cold
before
he
could
get
back
with
a
cart
and
that
it
was
very
doubtful
if
he
should
find
me
again
on
the
vast
plain
with
nothing
to
guide
him
and
in
the
midnight
darkness
whenever
we
came
to
a
little
creek
which
we
were
obliged
to
jump
helen
safe
arrival
on
the
opposite
bank
was
announced
by
a
loud
yell
from
me
caused
by
agony
hardly
to
be
described
the
cold
appeared
to
get
the
broken
joint
and
make
it
so
much
worse
at
last
we
reached
rockwood
and
never
was
its
friendly
shelter
more
welcome
everything
that
could
be
thought
of
was
done
to
alleviate
my
sufferings
but
i
resembled
punch
with
his
head
on
one
side
for
i
had
a
and
gigantic
hump
on
my
back
and
my
shoulder
was
swollen
up
to
my
ear
the
was
unpicked
as
it
was
impossible
to
get
it
off
any
other
way
of
course
the
night
was
one
of
great
agony
but
i
thought
often
as
i
paced
the
room
how
much
better
it
was
to
have
a
blazing
fire
to
cheer
me
up
and
some
delicious
tea
to
put
my
lips
to
when
so
dispoged
like
the
immortal
gamp
than
to
be
lying
on
the
open
plain
in
a
hard
frost
wondering
when
f
and
his
cart
would
arrive
the
next
day
we
returned
home
much
against
our
host
wish
and
i
walked
all
the
way
some
six
miles
of
mountain
road
for
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
riding
f
led
the
horses
and
we
arrived
quite
safely
his
first
idea
was
to
take
me
down
to
a
doctor
but
the
motion
of
driving
was
greater
agony
than
riding
as
the
road
was
rough
so
after
the
first
mile
i
entreated
to
be
taken
back
and
we
turned
the
horses
heads
towards
home
again
and
when
we
reached
it
i
got
out
all
my
little
books
on
surgery
medicine
and
from
them
made
out
how
to
set
my
shoulder
in
some
sort
of
fashion
with
f
help
of
course
it
is
still
useless
to
me
but
i
think
it
is
mending
itself
and
after
a
week
i
could
do
everything
with
my
left
hand
even
to
writing
after
a
fashion
the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
to
arrange
my
hair
or
even
to
brush
it
and
though
f
was
willing
he
was
so
exceedingly
awkward
that
at
last
after
going
through
great
anguish
and
having
it
pulled
out
by
handfuls
i
got
him
to
cut
it
off
and
it
is
now
cropped
like
a
small
boy
he
cuts
up
my
dinner
etc
for
me
but
it
is
a
very
trying
process
and
i
do
wonder
at
children
often
leaving
the
nasty
cold
mess
half
eaten
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
be
able
to
use
my
own
knife
again
letter
xxv
how
we
lost
our
horses
and
had
to
walk
home
broomielaw
november
this
will
actually
be
my
last
letter
from
the
malvern
hills
and
in
spite
of
the
joy
i
feel
at
the
hope
of
seeing
all
my
beloved
ones
in
england
i
am
sorry
to
leave
my
dear
little
happy
valley
we
have
done
nothing
but
pay
farewell
visits
lately
and
i
turn
for
a
final
look
at
each
station
or
cottage
as
we
ride
away
with
a
great
tightness
at
my
heart
and
moisture
in
my
eyes
to
think
i
shall
never
see
them
again
you
must
not
be
jealous
at
the
lingering
regrets
i
feel
for
unless
you
had
been
with
me
here
you
can
never
understand
how
kind
and
friendly
all
our
neighbours
high
and
low
have
been
to
us
from
the
very
first
or
how
dearly
i
have
grown
to
love
them
i
do
at
all
know
how
i
am
to
say
to
my
dear
m
the
wife
i
told
you
of
i
believe
she
will
miss
me
more
than
any
one
and
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
her
left
to
pass
her
days
without
the
help
of
books
and
papers
which
i
was
always
so
glad
to
lend
her
i
often
walk
down
the
valley
to
take
tea
with
her
of
an
afternoon
and
to
say
but
i
have
not
said
it
yet
i
wish
you
could
see
her
parlour
as
i
saw
it
yesterday
afternoon
her
books
in
a
bookcase
of
her
husband
manufacture
very
nice
and
pretty
her
in
the
comer
the
large
of
flowers
in
the
window
and
such
a
tea
on
the
table
cream
like
clots
of
gold
scones
all
sorts
of
delicacies
she
herself
is
quite
charming
one
of
nature
ladies
i
have
given
her
as
a
parting
gift
a
couple
of
scotch
views
framed
and
they
hang
on
the
wall
as
a
memento
of
places
equally
dear
to
both
of
us
it
is
a
sorrow
to
me
to
leave
the
horses
and
dogs
and
my
pet
calves
and
poultry
even
the
trees
and
creepers
i
go
round
to
look
at
with
the
melancholy
feeling
of
other
owners
not
loving
them
so
much
as
i
have
done
however
i
must
not
make
my
last
letter
too
dismal
or
you
will
feel
that
i
am
not
glad
enough
to
return
to
you
all
my
only
apology
is
i
have
been
so
happy
here
now
for
our
latest
adventure
as
absurd
as
any
in
its
way
have
i
ever
told
you
that
our
is
ten
miles
off
with
an
atrocious
road
between
us
and
it
i
know
you
will
throw
down
this
letter
and
feel
rather
disgusted
with
me
for
being
sorry
to
leave
such
a
place
but
we
do
mind
trifles
here
lately
since
our
own
establishment
has
been
broken
up
we
have
been
living
in
great
discomfort
and
among
other
things
we
generally
if
not
always
have
to
go
for
our
own
letters
twice
a
week
upon
this
occasion
f
and
i
had
ridden
together
up
the
gorge
of
the
selwyn
rather
late
in
the
afternoon
to
avoid
the
extreme
heat
of
the
day
when
we
reached
the
shepherd
hut
i
have
before
mentioned
and
which
is
now
deserted
i
proposed
to
f
to
go
on
over
the
hills
alone
and
leave
me
there
as
i
was
very
hot
and
tired
and
he
could
travel
much
quicker
without
me
for
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
still
object
to
riding
fast
up
and
down
slippery
hills
i
can
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
i
shall
break
my
neck
if
i
attempt
it
whereas
f
goes
on
over
the
worst
road
just
as
if
it
was
perfectly
level
excuse
this
digression
for
it
is
a
relief
to
me
to
be
a
little
spiteful
about
his
pace
whenever
i
have
an
opportunity
and
it
will
probably
be
my
last
chance
of
expressing
my
entire
disapproval
of
it
helen
was
tied
up
to
a
post
and
f
after
helping
me
to
dismount
set
off
at
a
canter
over
the
adjoining
swamp
on
his
way
to
cross
the
chain
of
hills
between
the
river
and
the
flat
where
the
great
to
the
west
coast
runs
i
had
brought
the
ingredients
for
my
five
tea
without
which
i
am
always
a
lost
and
miserable
creature
and
i
amused
myself
during
my
solitude
by
picking
up
dry
bits
of
scrub
for
my
fire
but
i
had
to
go
down
the
for
some
driftwood
to
make
the
old
kettle
belonging
to
the
hut
boil
i
could
not
help
wondering
how
any
human
being
could
endure
such
solitude
for
years
as
the
occupant
of
a
hut
like
this
is
necessarily
condemned
to
in
itself
it
was
as
snug
and
comfortable
as
possible
with
a
little
paddock
for
the
shepherd
horse
an
acre
or
so
of
garden
now
overgrown
with
potatoes
peas
strawberry
raspberry
and
gooseberry
plants
the
little
thatched
near
and
the
all
giving
it
a
thoroughly
look
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
river
over
its
rocky
bed
was
the
only
sound
now
and
then
a
flock
of
wild
ducks
would
come
flying
down
to
their
or
nests
among
the
tohi
grass
and
as
the
evening
closed
in
the
melancholy
cry
of
the
bittern
and
the
weka
loud
call
broke
the
stillness
but
only
to
make
it
appear
more
profound
on
each
side
of
the
ravine
in
which
the
hut
stands
rise
lofty
hills
so
steeply
from
the
water
edge
that
in
places
we
can
find
no
footing
for
our
horses
and
have
to
ride
in
the
river
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
sheep
are
all
upon
the
hills
so
you
do
not
hear
even
a
bleat
but
in
winter
they
come
down
to
the
sunny
sheltered
flats
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
i
was
alone
there
for
hours
though
it
really
was
less
than
one
hour
when
f
returned
with
a
large
bundle
of
letters
and
papers
tied
to
his
tea
was
quite
ready
now
so
he
tied
up
his
horse
next
helen
and
we
had
tea
and
looked
at
our
letters
one
of
the
first
i
opened
told
me
that
some
friends
from
christchurch
whom
i
expected
to
pay
us
a
visit
soon
were
on
their
way
up
that
very
day
and
in
fact
might
be
expected
to
arrive
just
about
that
hour
i
was
filled
with
blank
dismay
for
not
only
did
the
party
consist
of
three
people
nay
four
but
three
little
children
i
had
made
elaborate
plans
in
my
head
as
to
how
and
where
they
should
all
be
stowed
away
for
a
fortnight
but
had
naturally
deferred
till
the
last
moment
to
carry
out
my
arrangements
for
they
entailed
giving
up
our
own
bedroom
and
camping
in
the
besides
wonderful
substitutes
of
big
for
cribs
etc
etc
but
alas
here
we
were
eight
miles
from
home
and
nothing
done
not
even
any
extra
food
ordered
or
prepared
the
obvious
thing
was
to
mount
our
horses
and
return
as
fast
as
ever
we
could
and
we
hastened
out
of
the
hut
to
the
spot
where
we
had
left
them
both
securely
tied
to
the
only
available
post
through
which
unfortunately
five
wires
ran
as
it
was
one
of
the
standards
of
a
fence
which
extended
for
miles
just
as
we
came
out
of
the
hut
in
a
great
bustle
our
evil
destiny
induced
f
horse
to
rub
its
nose
against
the
top
wire
of
the
fence
and
in
this
process
it
caught
the
bar
of
its
and
immediately
pulled
back
this
made
all
the
wires
jingle
helen
instantly
took
alarm
and
pulled
back
too
fresh
and
increased
vibration
extending
up
the
and
echoing
back
an
appalling
sound
was
the
result
of
this
movement
in
an
instant
there
were
both
the
horses
pulling
with
all
their
force
against
the
fence
terrified
to
death
and
no
wonder
for
the
more
they
pulled
the
more
the
wires
jingled
f
did
all
he
could
to
soothe
them
with
blandishments
i
tried
to
coax
helen
but
the
nearer
we
drew
the
more
frantically
they
backed
and
plunged
and
the
more
the
noise
increased
till
it
was
a
case
of
one
struggle
more
and
i
am
free
and
leaving
their
bridles
still
fastened
to
the
fatal
fence
by
the
reins
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
both
our
horses
careering
wildly
about
first
celebrating
their
escape
from
danger
by
joyous
and
frantic
bounds
and
kicks
and
then
setting
off
down
the
gorge
of
the
river
as
hard
as
they
could
go
i
fairly
sat
down
and
whimpered
a
little
not
only
at
the
thought
of
our
eight
miles
walk
over
shingle
with
a
deep
river
to
be
crossed
nine
times
but
at
the
idea
of
my
poor
little
guests
arriving
to
find
no
supper
no
beds
no
nothing
f
tried
to
cheer
me
up
and
said
the
only
thing
was
to
get
home
as
quick
as
possible
but
he
did
not
expect
to
find
that
our
friends
had
arrived
for
it
had
been
very
hazy
over
the
plains
all
day
and
probably
had
rained
hard
in
christchurch
so
he
thought
they
would
not
have
started
on
their
journey
at
all
but
i
refused
to
accept
any
comfort
from
this
idea
and
bemoaned
myself
entirely
on
their
account
incessantly
when
we
came
to
the
first
crossing
f
picked
me
up
and
carried
me
over
and
this
he
did
at
all
the
fords
but
in
one
we
very
nearly
came
to
grief
for
i
was
tilted
like
a
sack
over
his
shoulder
and
when
we
were
quite
in
the
middle
and
the
water
was
very
deep
up
to
his
waist
he
kept
hoisting
my
feet
higher
and
higher
quite
forgetting
that
there
was
plenty
more
of
me
on
the
other
side
of
his
shoulder
so
it
ended
in
my
arms
getting
very
wet
which
he
did
not
seem
to
think
mattered
at
all
so
long
as
my
feet
were
dry
whereas
i
rather
preferred
having
my
feet
than
my
head
plunged
into
a
surging
deafening
yellow
current
at
the
entrance
of
the
gorge
is
a
large
stockyard
and
near
to
it
at
least
a
mile
or
two
off
a
large
mob
of
horses
is
generally
to
be
found
feeding
we
heard
great
neighing
and
galloping
about
amongst
them
as
we
came
out
of
the
gorge
it
was
much
too
dark
to
distinguish
anything
but
we
guessed
that
our
horses
had
joined
these
and
the
sounds
we
heard
were
probably
those
of
welcome
but
the
whole
mob
set
off
the
moment
we
came
near
and
crossed
the
river
again
entailing
a
tenth
wetting
upon
poor
f
i
was
posted
at
the
entrance
of
the
gorge
with
instructions
to
shout
and
otherwise
keep
them
from
going
up
by
the
route
we
had
just
come
but
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
f
could
get
round
the
wary
brutes
so
as
to
turn
them
with
their
heads
towards
the
stockyard
of
course
he
had
to
bring
up
the
whole
mob
my
talents
in
the
shouting
line
were
not
called
out
upon
this
occasion
for
they
all
trotted
into
the
stockyard
of
their
own
accord
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
put
up
the
as
fast
as
i
could
with
only
one
available
arm
for
though
it
is
better
i
can
not
use
the
other
yet
when
f
came
up
we
both
went
into
the
yard
and
could
soon
make
out
the
two
horses
which
had
their
saddles
on
that
was
the
only
way
we
could
distinguish
them
in
the
dark
it
was
now
nearly
eleven
and
though
warm
enough
it
was
very
cloudy
not
a
star
to
be
seen
we
fastened
on
the
patched
up
bridles
as
well
as
we
could
by
feeling
and
mounted
and
rode
home
about
three
miles
more
as
fast
as
we
could
when
we
entered
the
flat
near
our
own
house
we
heard
loud
and
prolonged
from
all
sides
the
servants
had
made
up
their
minds
that
some
terrible
misfortune
had
happened
to
us
and
were
setting
out
to
look
for
us
as
they
came
along
f
pointed
out
to
me
with
a
sort
of
air
that
there
was
no
light
in
the
so
it
was
evident
our
friends
had
not
arrived
and
when
we
dismounted
i
found
to
my
great
joy
that
the
house
was
empty
all
our
fatigue
was
forgotten
in
thankfulness
that
the
poor
travellers
had
not
been
exposed
to
such
a
cold
comfortless
reception
as
would
have
awaited
them
if
they
had
made
their
journey
that
day
i
must
tell
you
they
arrived
quite
safely
the
next
evening
but
very
tired
especially
the
poor
children
however
everything
was
ready
and
the
little
boys
were
particularly
pleased
with
their
box
beds
greatly
preferring
the
difficulties
of
getting
in
and
out
of
them
to
their
own
pretty
little
cribs
at
home
such
are
boys
all
over
the
world
next
month
we
leave
this
for
ever
and
go
down
to
christchurch
to
make
our
final
arrangements
for
the
long
voyage
of
a
hundred
days
before
us
as
the
time
draws
near
i
realize
how
strong
is
the
tie
which
has
grown
even
in
these
few
short
years
around
my
heart
connecting
it
with
this
lovely
land
and
the
kind
friends
i
have
found
in
it
f
feels
the
parting
more
deeply
than
i
do
if
possible
though
for
different
reasons
he
has
lived
so
long
among
these
beautiful
hills
and
is
so
accustomed
to
have
before
his
eyes
their
grand
outlines
he
was
telling
me
this
the
other
day
and
has
put
the
same
feelings
into
the
following
verses
which
i
now
send
you
a
farewell
the
seamen
shout
once
and
together
the
anchor
breaks
up
from
the
ground
and
the
ship
head
swings
to
the
weather
to
the
wind
and
the
sea
swings
round
with
a
clamour
the
great
sail
steadies
in
extreme
of
a
storm
scarce
furled
already
a
short
wake
eddies
and
a
furrow
is
cleft
and
curled
to
the
right
and
left
float
out
from
the
harbour
and
highland
that
hides
all
the
region
i
know
let
me
look
a
last
time
on
the
island
well
seen
from
the
sea
to
the
snow
the
lines
of
the
ranges
i
follow
i
travel
the
hills
with
my
eyes
for
i
know
where
they
make
a
deep
hollow
a
valley
of
grass
and
the
rise
of
streams
clearer
than
glass
that
haunt
is
too
far
for
me
wingless
and
the
hills
of
it
sink
out
of
sight
yet
my
thought
were
but
broken
and
stringless
and
the
daylight
of
song
were
but
night
if
i
could
not
at
will
a
winged
dream
let
lift
me
and
take
me
and
set
me
again
by
the
trees
and
the
streamlet
these
leagues
make
a
wide
water
yet
the
whole
world
shall
not
hide
now
my
days
leave
the
soft
silent
byway
and
clothed
in
a
various
sort
in
iron
or
gold
on
life
highway
new
feet
shall
succeed
or
stop
short
shod
hard
these
maybe
or
made
splendid
fair
and
many
or
evil
and
few
but
the
going
of
bare
feet
has
ended
of
naked
feet
set
in
the
new
meadow
grass
sweet
and
wet
i
will
long
for
the
ways
of
soft
walking
grown
tired
of
the
dust
and
the
glare
and
mute
in
the
midst
of
much
talking
will
pine
for
the
silences
rare
streets
of
peril
and
speech
full
of
malice
will
recall
me
the
pastures
and
peace
which
gardened
and
guarded
those
valleys
with
grasses
as
high
as
the
knees
calm
as
high
as
the
sky
while
the
island
secure
in
my
spirit
at
ease
on
its
own
ocean
rides
and
memory
a
ship
sailing
near
it
shall
float
in
with
favouring
tides
shall
enter
the
harbours
and
land
me
to
visit
the
gorges
and
heights
whose
aspects
seemed
once
to
command
me
as
queens
by
their
charms
command
knights
to
achievements
of
arms
and
as
knights
have
caught
sight
of
queens
faces
through
the
dust
of
the
lists
and
the
din
so
remembering
these
holiest
places
in
the
days
when
i
lose
or
i
win
i
will
yearn
to
them
all
being
over
triumphant
or
trampled
beneath
to
this
beautiful
isle
like
a
lover
to
her
evergreen
brakes
for
a
wreath
for
a
tear
to
her
lakes
the
last
of
her
now
is
a
brightening
far
fire
in
the
forested
hills
the
breeze
as
the
night
nears
is
heightening
the
cordage
draws
tighter
and
thrills
like
a
horse
that
is
spurred
by
the
rider
the
great
vessel
quivers
and
quails
and
passes
the
billows
beside
her
the
fair
wind
is
strong
in
her
sails
she
is
lifted
along
the
end
