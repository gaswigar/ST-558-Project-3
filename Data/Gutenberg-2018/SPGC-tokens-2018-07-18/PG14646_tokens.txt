oh
yes
you
both
very
fond
of
me
said
mr
twist
pulling
his
mouth
into
a
crooked
and
unhappy
smile
we
love
you
said
simply
chapter
i
their
names
were
really
and
but
they
decided
as
they
sat
huddled
together
in
a
corner
of
the
deck
of
the
american
liner
and
watched
the
dirty
water
of
the
mersey
slipping
past
and
the
liverpool
disappearing
into
mist
and
felt
that
it
was
comfortless
and
cold
and
knew
they
had
got
a
father
or
a
mother
and
remembered
that
they
were
aliens
and
realized
that
in
front
of
them
lay
a
great
deal
of
gray
uneasy
dreadfully
wet
sea
endless
stretches
of
it
days
and
days
of
it
with
waves
on
top
of
it
to
make
them
sick
and
submarines
beneath
it
to
kill
them
if
they
could
and
knew
that
they
had
the
remotest
idea
not
the
very
remotest
what
was
before
them
when
and
if
they
did
get
across
to
the
other
side
and
knew
that
they
were
refugees
castaways
derelicts
two
wretched
little
germans
who
were
neither
really
germans
nor
really
english
because
they
so
unfortunately
so
complicatedly
were
both
they
decided
looking
very
calm
and
determined
and
sitting
very
close
together
beneath
the
rug
their
english
aunt
had
given
them
to
put
round
their
miserable
alien
legs
that
what
they
really
were
were
christopher
and
columbus
because
they
were
setting
out
to
discover
a
new
world
it
very
pleasant
said
it
very
pleasant
to
go
and
discover
america
all
for
ourselves
it
was
who
suggested
their
being
christopher
and
columbus
she
was
the
elder
by
twenty
minutes
both
had
had
their
seventeenth
birthday
and
what
a
birthday
no
cake
no
candles
no
kisses
and
wreaths
and
poems
but
then
as
pointed
out
to
comfort
who
was
taking
it
hard
you
ca
get
blood
out
of
an
aunt
only
a
month
before
both
were
very
german
outside
and
very
english
inside
both
had
fair
hair
and
the
sorts
of
chins
germans
have
and
eyes
the
colour
of
the
sky
in
august
along
the
shores
of
the
baltic
their
noses
were
brief
and
had
been
objected
to
in
germany
where
if
you
are
a
junker
daughter
you
are
expected
to
show
it
in
your
nose
had
a
tight
little
body
inclined
to
the
round
in
spite
of
being
a
twin
seemed
to
have
made
the
most
of
her
twenty
extra
minutes
to
grow
more
in
anyhow
she
was
tall
and
thin
and
she
drooped
and
having
perhaps
grown
quicker
made
her
eyes
more
dreamy
and
her
thoughts
more
slow
and
both
held
their
heads
up
with
a
great
air
of
calm
whenever
anybody
on
the
ship
looked
at
them
as
who
should
say
serenely
we
happy
and
having
the
time
of
our
lives
for
worlds
they
would
have
admitted
to
each
other
that
they
were
even
aware
of
such
a
thing
as
being
anxious
or
wanting
to
cry
like
other
persons
of
english
blood
they
never
were
so
cheerful
nor
pretended
to
be
so
much
amused
as
when
they
were
right
down
on
the
very
bottom
of
their
luck
like
other
persons
of
german
blood
they
had
the
squashiest
corners
deep
in
their
hearts
where
they
secretly
clung
to
cakes
and
christmas
trees
and
fought
a
tendency
to
celebrate
every
possible
anniversary
both
dead
and
alive
the
gulls
circling
white
against
the
gloomy
sky
over
the
rubbish
that
floated
on
the
mersey
made
them
feel
extraordinarily
forlorn
empty
boxes
bits
of
straw
a
variety
of
dismal
dirtiness
lay
about
on
the
sullen
water
england
was
slipping
away
england
their
mother
country
the
country
of
their
dreams
ever
since
they
could
remember
and
the
with
a
loud
screech
had
suddenly
stopped
neither
of
them
could
help
jumping
a
little
at
that
and
getting
an
inch
closer
together
beneath
the
rug
surely
it
was
a
submarine
already
we
christopher
and
columbus
said
quickly
changing
as
it
were
the
unspoken
conversation
as
the
eldest
she
had
a
great
sense
of
her
responsibility
toward
her
twin
and
considered
it
one
of
her
first
duties
to
cheer
and
encourage
her
their
mother
had
always
cheered
and
encouraged
them
and
seemed
to
mind
anything
however
awful
it
was
that
happened
to
her
such
as
for
instance
when
the
war
began
and
they
three
their
father
having
died
some
years
before
left
their
home
up
by
the
baltic
just
as
there
was
the
most
heavenly
weather
going
on
and
the
garden
was
a
dream
and
the
blue
chinchilla
cat
had
produced
four
perfect
kittens
that
very
day
all
of
whom
had
to
be
left
to
what
whose
thoughts
if
slow
were
picturesque
once
she
had
got
them
called
the
tender
mercies
of
a
savage
and
licentious
soldiery
and
came
by
slow
and
difficult
stages
to
england
or
such
as
when
their
mother
began
catching
cold
and
did
seem
at
last
ever
able
to
leave
off
catching
cold
and
though
she
tried
to
pretend
she
did
mind
colds
and
that
they
did
matter
it
was
plain
that
these
colds
did
at
last
matter
very
much
for
between
them
they
killed
her
their
mother
had
always
been
cheerful
and
full
of
hope
now
that
she
was
dead
it
was
clearly
duty
as
the
next
eldest
in
the
family
to
carry
on
the
tradition
and
discountenance
too
much
drooping
in
was
staring
much
too
thoughtfully
at
the
deepening
gloom
of
the
late
afternoon
sky
and
the
rubbish
brooding
on
the
face
of
the
waters
and
she
had
jumped
rather
excessively
when
the
stopped
so
suddenly
just
as
if
it
were
putting
on
the
brake
hard
and
emitted
that
agonized
whistle
we
christopher
and
columbus
said
quickly
and
going
to
discover
america
very
well
said
i
be
christopher
no
i
be
christopher
said
very
well
said
who
was
the
most
amiable
acquiescent
person
in
the
world
then
i
suppose
i
have
to
be
columbus
but
i
think
christopher
sounds
prettier
both
rolled
their
r
incurably
it
was
evidently
in
their
blood
for
nothing
no
amount
of
teaching
and
admonishment
could
get
them
out
of
it
before
they
were
able
to
talk
at
all
in
those
happy
days
when
parents
make
astounding
assertions
to
other
parents
about
the
intelligence
and
certain
future
brilliancy
of
their
offspring
and
the
other
parents
however
much
they
may
pity
such
contradict
because
after
all
it
just
possibly
may
be
so
the
most
foolish
people
occasionally
producing
geniuses
in
those
happy
days
of
undisturbed
bright
the
mother
who
was
english
of
the
two
derelicts
now
huddled
on
the
dank
deck
of
the
said
to
the
father
who
was
german
at
any
rate
these
two
blessed
little
bundles
of
deliciousness
she
had
one
on
each
arm
and
was
tickling
their
noses
alternately
with
her
eyelashes
and
they
were
screaming
for
joy
wo
have
to
learn
either
german
or
english
they
just
them
perhaps
said
the
father
who
was
a
cautious
man
they
born
said
the
mother
and
the
twins
wheezed
and
choked
with
laughter
for
she
was
tickling
them
beneath
their
chins
softly
fluttering
her
eyelashes
along
the
creases
of
fat
she
thought
so
adorable
perhaps
said
the
father
it
gives
them
a
tremendous
start
said
the
mother
and
the
twins
squirmed
in
a
dreadful
ecstasy
for
she
had
now
got
to
their
ears
perhaps
said
the
father
but
what
happened
was
that
they
did
speak
either
language
not
that
is
as
a
native
should
their
german
bristled
with
mistakes
they
spoke
it
with
a
foreign
accent
it
was
copious
but
incorrect
almost
the
last
thing
their
father
an
accurate
man
said
to
them
as
he
lay
dying
had
to
do
with
a
misplaced
dative
and
when
they
talked
english
it
rolled
about
uncontrollably
on
its
r
and
had
a
great
many
long
words
in
it
got
from
milton
and
johnson
and
people
like
that
whom
their
mother
had
particularly
loved
but
as
they
talked
far
more
to
their
mother
than
to
their
father
who
was
a
man
of
much
briefness
in
words
though
not
in
temper
they
were
better
on
the
whole
at
english
than
german
their
mother
who
loved
england
more
the
longer
she
lived
away
from
it
as
one
does
and
the
same
principle
explained
to
when
they
had
lived
some
time
with
their
aunt
and
uncle
applies
to
relations
aunts
husbands
and
the
clergy
never
tired
of
telling
her
children
about
it
and
its
poetry
and
its
spirit
and
the
greatness
and
glory
of
its
points
of
view
they
drank
it
all
in
and
believed
every
word
of
it
for
so
did
their
mother
and
as
they
grew
up
they
flung
themselves
on
all
the
english
books
they
could
lay
hands
upon
and
they
read
with
their
mother
and
learned
by
heart
most
of
the
obviously
beautiful
things
and
because
she
glowed
with
enthusiasm
they
glowed
too
in
a
flare
and
a
flash
slow
and
steadily
they
adored
their
mother
whatever
she
loved
they
loved
blindly
it
was
a
pity
she
died
she
died
soon
after
the
war
began
they
had
been
so
happy
so
happy
you
ca
be
christopher
said
giving
herself
a
shake
for
here
she
was
thinking
of
her
mother
and
it
did
do
to
think
of
mother
she
found
at
least
not
when
one
is
off
to
a
new
life
and
everything
is
all
promise
because
it
is
anything
else
and
not
if
one
mother
happened
to
have
been
so
well
so
fearfully
sweet
you
ca
be
christopher
because
you
see
i
the
eldest
did
see
what
being
the
eldest
had
to
do
with
it
but
she
only
said
very
well
in
her
soft
voice
and
expressed
a
hope
that
would
see
her
way
not
to
call
her
col
for
short
i
afraid
you
will
though
she
added
and
then
i
shall
feel
so
like
onkel
nicolas
this
was
their
german
uncle
known
during
his
which
had
abruptly
left
off
when
the
twins
were
ten
as
onkel
col
a
very
ancient
person
older
by
far
even
than
their
father
who
had
seemed
so
very
old
but
onkel
col
had
been
older
than
anybody
at
all
except
the
pictures
of
the
in
blake
illustrations
to
the
book
of
job
he
came
to
a
bad
end
neither
their
father
nor
their
mother
told
them
anything
except
that
onkel
col
was
dead
and
their
father
put
a
black
band
round
the
left
sleeve
of
his
tweed
country
suit
and
was
more
than
ever
and
their
mother
when
they
questioned
her
just
said
that
poor
onkel
col
had
gone
to
heaven
and
that
in
future
they
would
speak
of
him
as
onkel
nicolas
because
it
was
more
respectful
but
why
does
mummy
call
him
poor
when
he
gone
to
heaven
asked
privately
in
the
recesses
of
the
garden
first
of
all
said
who
being
the
eldest
as
she
so
often
explained
to
her
sister
naturally
knew
more
about
everything
because
the
angels
wo
like
him
nobody
like
onkel
col
even
if
they
angels
and
though
they
obliged
to
have
him
there
because
he
was
such
a
very
good
man
they
wo
talk
to
him
much
or
notice
him
much
when
god
is
looking
and
second
of
all
because
you
poor
when
you
get
to
heaven
everybody
is
poor
in
heaven
nobody
takes
their
things
with
them
and
all
onkel
col
money
is
still
on
earth
he
could
even
take
his
clothes
with
him
then
is
he
quite
did
onkel
col
go
there
quite
stopped
the
word
seemed
too
awful
in
connection
with
onkel
col
that
terrifying
old
gentleman
who
had
roared
at
them
from
the
folds
of
so
many
wonderful
wadded
garments
whenever
they
were
led
in
trembling
to
see
him
for
he
had
gout
and
was
very
terrible
and
it
seemed
particularly
awful
when
one
thought
of
onkel
col
going
to
heaven
which
was
surely
of
all
places
the
most
of
course
nodded
but
even
she
dropped
her
voice
a
little
she
peeped
about
among
the
bushes
a
moment
then
put
her
mouth
close
to
ear
and
whispered
stark
they
stared
at
one
another
for
a
space
with
awe
and
horror
in
their
eyes
you
see
then
went
on
rather
quickly
hurrying
away
from
the
awful
vision
one
knows
one
does
have
clothes
in
heaven
because
they
do
have
the
moth
there
it
says
so
in
the
bible
and
you
ca
have
the
moth
without
having
anything
for
it
to
go
into
then
they
do
have
to
have
naphthalin
either
said
and
do
all
have
to
smell
horrid
in
the
autumn
when
they
take
their
furs
out
no
and
thieves
do
break
in
and
steal
either
in
heaven
continued
and
the
reason
why
is
that
there
anything
to
steal
there
angels
suggested
after
a
pause
for
she
like
to
think
there
was
nothing
really
valuable
in
heaven
oh
nobody
ever
steals
said
slow
thoughts
revolved
round
this
new
uncomfortable
view
of
heaven
it
seemed
if
were
right
and
she
always
was
right
for
she
said
so
herself
that
heaven
could
be
such
a
safe
place
after
all
nor
such
a
kind
place
thieves
could
break
in
and
steal
if
they
wanted
to
she
had
a
proper
horror
of
thieves
she
was
sure
the
night
would
certainly
come
when
they
would
break
into
her
or
as
her
english
nurse
called
it
her
dear
papa
slosh
and
she
was
worried
that
poor
onkel
col
should
be
being
snubbed
up
there
and
without
anything
to
put
on
which
would
make
being
snubbed
so
much
worse
for
clothes
did
somehow
comfort
one
she
took
her
worries
to
the
nursemaid
and
choosing
a
moment
when
she
knew
wished
to
be
unnoticed
it
being
her
hour
for
inconspicuously
eating
unripe
apples
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
an
exercise
only
did
indulge
in
because
she
had
learned
through
affliction
that
her
inside
fond
and
proud
of
it
as
she
was
was
yet
not
of
that
superior
and
blessed
kind
that
suffers
green
apples
gladly
she
sought
out
the
nursemaid
whose
name
too
confusingly
was
anna
and
led
the
conversation
up
to
heaven
and
the
possible
conditions
prevailing
in
it
by
asking
her
to
tell
her
in
strict
confidence
and
as
woman
to
woman
what
she
thought
onkel
col
exactly
looked
like
at
that
moment
unrecognizable
said
the
nursemaid
promptly
unrecognizable
echoed
and
the
nursemaid
after
glancing
over
her
shoulder
to
see
if
the
governess
were
nowhere
in
sight
told
the
true
story
of
onkel
col
end
which
is
so
bad
that
it
is
fit
to
be
put
in
any
book
except
one
with
an
appendix
a
stewardess
passed
just
as
was
asking
not
to
remind
her
of
these
grim
portions
of
the
past
by
calling
her
col
a
stewardess
in
such
a
very
clean
white
cap
that
she
looked
both
reliable
and
benevolent
while
secretly
she
was
neither
can
you
please
tell
us
why
we
stopping
inquired
of
her
politely
leaning
forward
to
catch
her
attention
as
she
hurried
by
the
stewardess
allowed
her
roving
eye
to
alight
for
a
moment
on
the
two
objects
beneath
the
rug
their
chairs
were
close
together
and
the
rug
covered
them
both
up
to
their
chins
over
the
top
of
it
their
heads
appeared
exactly
alike
as
far
as
she
could
see
in
the
dusk
round
heads
each
with
a
blue
knitted
cap
pulled
well
over
its
ears
and
round
eyes
staring
at
her
with
what
anybody
except
the
stewardess
would
have
recognized
as
a
passionate
desire
for
some
sort
of
reassurance
they
might
have
been
seven
instead
of
seventeen
for
all
the
stewardess
could
tell
they
looked
younger
than
anything
she
had
yet
seen
sitting
alone
on
a
deck
and
asking
questions
but
she
was
an
exasperated
widow
who
had
never
had
children
and
was
to
be
touched
by
anything
except
a
tip
besides
despising
because
she
was
herself
a
stewardess
all
passengers
as
one
does
explained
later
on
to
and
the
same
principle
applies
to
jews
so
she
said
with
an
acidity
completely
at
variance
with
the
promise
of
her

ask
the
captain
and
disappeared
the
twins
looked
at
each
other
they
knew
very
well
that
captains
on
ships
were
mighty
beings
who
were
not
asked
questions
she
trifling
with
us
murmured
yes
was
obliged
to
admit
though
the
thought
was
repugnant
to
her
that
they
should
look
like
people
a
stewardess
would
dare
trifle
with
perhaps
she
thinks
we
younger
than
we
are
she
said
after
a
silence
yes
she
could
see
how
long
our
dresses
are
because
of
the
rug
no
and
it
only
that
end
of
us
that
really
shows
we
grown
up
yes
she
ought
to
have
seen
us
six
months
ago
indeed
she
ought
even
the
stewardess
would
have
been
surprised
at
the
activities
and
complete
appearance
of
the
two
pupæ
now
rolled
motionless
in
the
rug
for
six
months
ago
they
had
both
been
probationers
in
a
children
hospital
in
worcestershire
arrayed
even
as
the
stewardess
in
spotless
caps
hurrying
hither
and
thither
with
trays
of
food
sweeping
and
washing
up
learning
to
make
beds
in
a
given
time
and
be
deft
and
quick
and
never
tired
and
always
punctual
this
place
had
been
got
them
by
the
efforts
and
influence
of
their
aunt
alice
that
aunt
who
had
given
them
the
rug
on
their
departure
and
who
had
omitted
to
celebrate
their
birthday
she
was
an
amiable
aunt
but
she
did
understand
about
birthdays
it
was
the
first
one
they
had
had
since
they
were
complete
orphans
and
so
they
were
rather
sensitive
about
it
but
they
had
cried
because
since
their
mother
death
they
had
done
with
crying
what
could
there
ever
again
be
in
the
world
bad
enough
to
cry
about
after
that
and
besides
just
before
she
dropped
away
from
them
into
the
unconsciousness
out
of
which
she
never
came
back
but
instead
just
dropped
a
little
further
into
death
she
had
opened
her
eyes
unexpectedly
and
caught
them
sitting
together
in
a
row
by
her
bed
two
images
of
agony
with
tears
rolling
down
their
swollen
faces
and
their
noses
in
a
hopeless
state
and
after
looking
at
them
a
moment
as
if
she
had
slowly
come
up
from
some
vast
depth
and
distance
and
were
gradually
recognizing
them
she
had
whispered
with
a
flicker
of
the
old
encouraging
smile
that
had
comforted
every
hurt
and
bruise
they
had
ever
had
little
darlings
cry
but
on
that
first
birthday
after
her
death
they
had
got
more
and
more
solemn
as
time
passed
and
breakfast
was
cleared
away
and
there
were
no
sounds
prick
up
their
ears
as
they
might
of
subdued
preparations
in
the
next
room
no
stealthy
going
up
and
down
stairs
to
fetch
the
presents
and
at
last
no
hope
at
all
of
the
final
glorious
flinging
open
of
the
door
and
the
vision
inside
of
two
cakes
all
glittering
with
candles
each
on
a
table
covered
with
flowers
and
all
the
things
one
has
most
wanted
their
aunt
did
know
how
should
she
england
was
a
great
and
beloved
country
but
it
did
have
proper
birthdays
every
country
has
one
drawback
explained
to
when
the
morning
was
finally
over
in
case
she
should
by
any
chance
be
thinking
badly
of
the
dear
country
that
had
produced
their
mother
as
well
as
shakespeare
and
not
knowing
about
birthdays
is
england
there
uncle
arthur
said
whose
honest
mind
groped
continually
after
accuracy
yes
admitted
after
a
pause
yes

chapter
ii
uncle
arthur
was
the
husband
of
aunt
alice
he
did
like
foreigners
and
said
so
he
never
had
liked
them
and
had
always
said
so
it
the
war
at
all
it
was
the
foreigners
but
as
the
war
went
on
and
these
german
nieces
of
his
wife
became
more
and
more
as
he
told
her
a
blighted
nuisance
so
did
he
become
more
and
more
pointed
and
said
he
did
mind
french
foreigners
nor
russian
foreigners
and
a
few
weeks
later
that
it
was
italian
foreigners
either
that
he
minded
and
still
later
that
nor
was
it
foreigners
indigenous
to
the
soil
of
countries
called
neutral
these
things
he
said
aloud
at
meals
in
a
general
way
to
his
wife
when
alone
he
said
much
more
who
was
nothing
if
not
intrepid
at
first
tried
to
soften
his
heart
by
offering
to
read
aloud
to
him
in
the
evenings
when
he
came
home
weary
from
his
daily
avocations
which
were
golf
her
own
suggestion
instantly
projected
a
touching
picture
on
her
impressionable
imagination
of
youth
grateful
for
a
roof
over
its
head
in
return
alleviating
the
tedium
of
crabbed
age
by
introducing
its
uncle
who
from
his
remarks
was
evidently
unacquainted
with
them
to
the
best
productions
of
the
great
masters
of
english
literature
but
uncle
arthur
merely
stared
at
her
with
a
lacklustre
eye
when
she
proposed
it
from
his
position
on
the
hearthrug
where
he
was
moving
money
about
in
of
the
best
material
and
later
on
she
discovered
that
he
had
always
supposed
the
faery
queen
and
adonais
and
in
memoriam
names
he
had
heard
at
intervals
during
his
life
for
he
was
fifty
and
such
things
do
sometimes
get
mentioned
were
racehorses
uncle
arthur
like
onkel
col
was
a
very
good
man
and
though
he
said
things
about
foreigners
he
did
stick
to
these
unfortunate
alien
nieces
longer
than
one
would
have
supposed
possible
if
one
had
overheard
what
he
said
to
aunt
alice
in
the
seclusion
of
their
bed
his
ordered
existence
shaken
enough
by
the
war
heaven
knew
was
shaken
in
its
innermost
parts
in
its
very
marrow
by
the
arrival
of
the
two
germans
other
people
round
about
had
belgians
in
their
homes
and
groaned
but
who
but
he
the
most
immensely
british
of
anybody
had
germans
and
he
could
groan
because
they
were
besides
being
motherless
creatures
his
own
wife
flesh
and
blood
not
openly
at
least
could
he
groan
but
he
could
and
did
do
it
in
bed
why
on
earth
that
silly
mother
of
theirs
could
have
stayed
quietly
on
her
pomeranian
where
she
belonged
instead
of
coming
gallivanting
over
to
england
and
then
when
she
had
got
there
not
even
decently
staying
alive
and
seeing
to
her
children
herself
he
at
frequent
intervals
told
aunt
alice
in
bed
that
he
would
like
to
know
aunt
alice
who
after
twenty
years
of
life
with
uncle
arthur
was
both
silent
and
sleek
for
he
fed
her
well
sighed
and
said
nothing
she
herself
was
quietly
going
through
very
much
on
behalf
of
her
nieces
jessup
did
like
handing
dishes
to
germans
the
tradespeople
twitted
the
cook
with
having
to
cook
for
them
and
were
facetious
about
sausages
and
asked
how
one
made
sauerkraut
her
acquaintances
told
her
they
were
very
sorry
for
her
and
said
they
supposed
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
and
that
it
was
all
right
about
spies
but
really
one
heard
such
strange
things
one
never
could
possibly
tell
even
with
children
and
regularly
the
local
policeman
bicycled
over
to
see
if
the
aliens
who
were
registered
at
the
were
still
safe
and
then
they
looked
so
very
german
aunt
alice
felt
there
was
no
mistaking
them
and
every
time
they
opened
their
mouths
there
were
all
those
rolling
about
she
hardly
liked
callers
to
find
her
nieces
in
her
at
they
were
so
difficult
to
explain
yet
they
were
too
old
to
shut
up
in
a
nursery
after
three
months
of
them
uncle
arthur
suggested
sending
them
back
to
germany
but
their
consternation
had
been
so
great
and
their
entreaties
to
be
kept
where
they
were
so
desperate
that
he
said
no
more
about
that
besides
they
told
him
that
if
they
went
back
there
they
would
be
sure
to
be
shot
as
spies
for
over
there
nobody
would
believe
they
were
german
just
as
over
here
nobody
would
believe
they
were
english
and
besides
this
was
in
those
days
of
the
war
when
england
was
still
regarding
germany
as
more
mistaken
than
vicious
and
was
as
full
as
ever
of
the
tradition
of
great
and
elaborate
indulgence
and
generosity
toward
a
foe
and
uncle
arthur
whatever
he
might
say
was
not
going
to
be
behind
his
country
in
generosity
yet
as
time
passed
and
feeling
tightened
and
the
hideous
necklace
of
war
grew
more
and
more
frightful
with
each
fresh
bead
of
horror
strung
upon
it
uncle
arthur
though
still
in
principle
remaining
good
in
practice
found
himself
vindictive
he
was
saddled
that
what
he
was
saddled
with
this
monstrous
unmerited
burden
he
the
most
patriotic
of
britons
looked
at
askance
by
his
best
friends
being
given
notice
by
his
old
servants
having
particular
attention
paid
his
house
at
night
by
the
police
getting
anonymous
letters
about
lights
seen
in
his
upper
windows
the
nights
the
zeppelins
came
which
were
the
windows
of
the
floor
those
blighted
twins
slept
on
and
all
because
he
had
married
aunt
alice
at
this
period
aunt
alice
went
to
bed
with
reluctance
it
was
not
a
place
she
had
ever
gone
to
very
willingly
since
she
married
uncle
arthur
for
he
was
the
kind
of
husband
who
rebukes
in
bed
but
now
she
was
downright
reluctant
it
was
painful
to
her
to
be
told
that
she
had
brought
this
disturbance
into
uncle
arthur
life
by
having
let
him
marry
her
inquiring
backwards
into
her
recollections
it
appeared
to
her
that
she
had
had
no
say
at
all
about
being
married
but
that
uncle
arthur
had
told
her
she
was
going
to
be
and
then
that
she
had
been
which
was
what
had
indeed
happened
for
aunt
alice
was
a
round
little
woman
even
in
those
days
nicely
though
not
obtrusively
padded
with
agreeable
fat
at
the
corners
and
her
skin
just
as
now
had
the
moist
delicacy
that
comes
from
eating
a
great
many
chickens
also
she
suggested
just
as
now
most
of
the
things
most
men
want
to
come
home
to
slippers
and
drawn
curtains
and
a
blazing
fire
and
peace
within
one
borders
and
even
as
pointed
out
privately
to
after
they
had
come
across
them
for
the
first
time
she
suggested
muffins
and
so
being
in
these
varied
fashions
succulent
she
was
doomed
to
make
some
good
man
happy
but
she
did
find
it
real
hard
work
it
grew
plain
to
aunt
alice
after
another
month
of
them
that
uncle
arthur
would
not
much
longer
endure
his
nieces
and
that
even
if
he
did
she
would
not
be
able
to
endure
uncle
arthur
the
thought
was
very
dreadful
to
her
that
she
was
being
forced
to
choose
between
two
duties
and
that
she
could
not
fulfil
both
it
came
to
this
at
last
that
she
must
either
stand
by
her
nieces
her
dead
sister
fatherless
children
and
face
all
the
difficulties
and
discomforts
of
such
a
standing
by
go
away
with
them
take
care
of
them
till
the
war
was
over
or
she
must
stand
by
arthur
she
chose
arthur
how
could
she
for
nieces
she
had
hardly
seen
abandon
her
husband
besides
he
had
scolded
her
so
steadily
during
the
whole
of
their
married
life
that
she
was
now
unalterably
attached
to
him
sometimes
a
wild
thought
did
for
a
moment
illuminate
the
soothing
dusk
of
her
mind
the
thought
of
doing
the
heroic
thing
leaving
him
for
them
and
helping
and
protecting
the
two
poor
aliens
till
happier
days
should
return
if
there
were
any
good
stuff
in
arthur
would
he
not
recognize
however
angry
he
might
be
that
she
was
doing
at
least
a
christian
thing
but
this
illumination
would
soon
die
out
her
comforts
choked
it
she
was
too
after
twenty
years
of
it
she
no
longer
had
the
figure
for
lean
and
dangerous
enterprises
and
having
definitely
chosen
arthur
she
concentrated
what
she
had
of
determination
in
finding
an
employment
for
her
nieces
that
would
remove
them
beyond
the
range
of
his
growing
wrath
she
found
it
in
a
hospital
as
far
away
as
worcestershire
a
hospital
subscribed
to
very
largely
by
arthur
for
being
a
good
man
he
subscribed
to
hospitals
the
matron
objected
but
aunt
alice
overrode
the
matron
and
from
january
to
april
uncle
arthur
house
was
pure
from
germans
then
they
came
back
again
it
had
been
impossible
to
keep
them
the
nurses
would
work
with
them
the
sick
children
had
relapses
when
they
discovered
who
it
was
who
brought
them
their
food
and
cried
for
their
mothers
it
had
been
arranged
between
aunt
alice
and
the
matron
that
the
unfortunate
nationality
of
her
nieces
should
not
be
mentioned
they
were
just
to
be
aunt
alice
nieces
the
miss
twinklers
we
will
leave
out
the
von
said
aunt
alice
full
of
unnatural
cunning
they
have
a
von
you
know
poor
things
such
a
very
labelling
thing
to
have
but
twinkler
without
it
might
quite
well
be
english
who
can
possibly
tell
it
is
as
though
they
had
had
some
shocking
name
like
bismarck
nothing
however
availed
against
the
damning
evidence
of
the
rolled
r
combined
with
the
silvery
fair
hair
and
the
determined
little
mouths
and
chins
it
was
irresistible
clearly
they
were
foreigners
and
equally
clearly
they
were
not
italians
or
russians
or
french
within
a
week
the
nurses
spoke
of
them
in
private
as
fritz
and
franz
within
a
fortnight
a
deputation
of
staff
sisters
went
to
the
matron
and
asked
on
patriotic
grounds
for
the
removal
of
the
misses
twinkler
the
matron
with
the
fear
of
uncle
arthur
in
her
heart
for
he
was
altogether
the
biggest
subscriber
sharply
sent
the
deputation
about
its
business
and
being
a
matron
of
great
competence
and
courage
she
would
probably
have
continued
to
be
able
to
force
the
new
probationers
upon
the
nurses
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
inability
which
was
conspicuous
of
the
younger
miss
twinkler
to
acquire
efficiency
in
vain
did
try
to
make
up
for
shortcomings
by
a
double
zeal
a
double
willingness
and
cheerfulness
was
a
born
dreamer
a
born
bungler
with
her
hands
and
feet
she
not
only
never
from
first
to
last
succeeded
in
filling
the
thirty
bottles
which
were
her
care
in
thirty
minutes
which
was
her
duty
but
every
time
she
met
a
pail
standing
about
she
knocked
against
it
and
it
fell
over
patients
and
nurses
watched
her
approach
with
apprehension
her
ward
was
in
a
constant
condition
of
flood
it
because
she
thinking
of
something
else
tried
eagerly
to
explain
to
the
indignant
thinking
of
something
else
echoed
the
sister
she
reads
you
see
a
lot
whenever
she
gets
the
chance
she
reads
reads
echoed
the
sister
and
then
you
see
she
gets
thinking
thinking
reading
does
make
think
with
much
regret
wrote
the
matron
to
aunt
alice
i
am
obliged
to
dismiss
your
younger
niece
nurse
twinkler
ii
she
has
no
vocation
for
nursing
on
the
other
hand
your
elder
niece
is
shaping
well
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
keep
her
on
but
i
ca
stop
on
said
to
the
matron
when
she
announced
these
decisions
to
her
i
ca
be
separated
from
my
sister
i
like
very
much
to
know
what
would
become
of
that
poor
child
without
me
to
look
after
her
you
forget
i
the
eldest
the
matron
put
down
her
pen
she
was
a
woman
who
made
many
notes
and
stared
at
nurse
twinkler
not
in
this
fashion
did
her
nurses
speak
to
her
but
having
been
brought
up
in
a
spot
remote
from
everything
except
love
and
laughter
had
all
the
fearlessness
of
ignorance
and
in
her
extreme
youth
and
smallness
with
her
eyes
shining
and
her
face
heated
she
appeared
to
the
matron
rather
like
an
indignant
kitten
very
well
said
the
matron
gravely
suppressing
a
smile
one
should
always
do
what
one
considers
one
first
duty
so
the
twinklers
went
back
to
uncle
arthur
and
the
matron
was
greatly
relieved
for
she
certainly
did
want
them
and
uncle
arthur
said
damn
arthur
gently
reproved
his
wife
i
say
damn
and
i
mean
damn
said
uncle
arthur
what
the

arthur
said
his

what

would
swallow
them
last
winter
are
they
going
to
swallow
them
any
better
now
god
what
troubles
a
man
lets
himself
in
for
when
he
marries
i
do
beg
you
arthur
not
to
use
those
coarse
words
said
aunt
alice
tears
in
her
gentle
eyes
there
followed
a
period
of
desperate
exertion
on
the
part
of
aunt
alice
she
answered
advertisements
and
offered
the
twins
as
nursery
governesses
as
cheerful
companions
as
mothers
helps
even
as
orphans
willing
to
be
adopted
she
relinquished
every
claim
on
salaries
she
offered
them
for
nothing
and
at
last
she
offered
them
accompanied
by
a
bonus
their
mother
was
english
they
are
quite
english
wrote
aunt
alice
innumerable
times
in
innumerable
letters
i
feel
bound
however
to
tell
you
that
they
once
had
a
german
father
but
of
course
it
was
through
no
fault
of
their
own
etc
aunt
alice
hand
ached
with
writing
letters
and
any
solution
of
the
problem
that
might
possibly
have
been
arrived
at
came
to
nothing
because
would
not
be
separated
from
and
if
it
was
difficult
to
find
anybody
who
would
take
on
one
german
nobody
at
all
could
be
found
to
take
on
two
meanwhile
uncle
arthur
grew
nightly
more
dreadful
in
bed
aunt
alice
was
at
her
wits
end
and
took
to
crying
helplessly
the
twins
racked
their
brains
to
find
a
way
out
quite
as
anxious
to
relieve
uncle
arthur
of
their
presence
as
he
was
to
be
relieved
if
only
they
could
be
independent
do
something
work
go
as
housemaids
anything
they
concocted
an
and
secretly
sent
it
to
clubbing
their
together
to
pay
for
it
the
advertisement
was
energetic
sisters
of
belligerent
ancestry
but
unimpeachable
sympathies
wish
for
any
sort
of
work
consistent
with
respectability
no
objection
to
being
demeaned
inquired
what
that
last
word
meant
for
it
was
word
and
explained
that
it
meant
not
minding
things
like
being
housemaids
which
we
do
said
upper
and
under
i
be
upper
of
course
because
i
the
eldest
suggested
putting
in
what
it
meant
then
for
she
regarded
it
with
some
doubt
but
it
being
her
word
liked
it
and
explained
that
it
put
a
whole
sentence
into
a
and
change
it
no
one
answered
this
advertisement
except
a
society
in
london
for
helping
alien
enemies
in
distress
charity
said
turning
up
her
nose
and
fancy
thinking
enemies
said
us
while
mummy
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
kept
them
back
however
behind
convenient
long
then
they
saw
an
advertisement
in
the
front
page
of
that
they
instantly
answered
without
saying
a
word
to
aunt
alice
the
advertisement
was
slightly
wounded
officer
would
be
glad
to
find
intelligent
and
interesting
companion
who
can
drive
a
humber
emoluments
by
arrangement
we
him
we
intelligent
and
interesting
said
eagerly
yes
who
knows
if
we
would
be
really
if
we
were
given
a
chance
said
quite
flushed
with
excitement
and
if
he
engages
us
we
take
him
on
in
turns
so
that
the
emoluments
wo
have
to
be
doubled
yes
because
he
might
like
paying
twice
over
yes
and
while
the
preliminaries
are
being
settled
we
could
be
learning
to
drive
uncle
arthur
car
yes
except
that
it
a
daimler
and
are
they
different
yes
but
only
about
the
same
difference
as
there
is
between
a
man
and
a
woman
a
man
and
a
woman
are
both
human
beings
you
know
and
daimlers
and
humbers
are
both
cars
i
see
said
but
she
did
they
wrote
an
enthusiastic
answer
that
very
day
the
only
thing
they
were
in
doubt
about
they
explained
toward
the
end
of
the
fourth
sheet
when
they
had
got
to
politenesses
and
were
requesting
the
slightly
wounded
officer
to
allow
them
to
express
their
sympathy
with
his
wounds
was
that
they
had
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
driving
a
humber
car
but
that
this
opportunity
of
course
would
be
instantly
provided
by
his
engaging
them
also
would
he
kindly
tell
them
if
it
was
a
male
companion
he
desired
to
have
because
if
so
it
was
very
unfortunate
for
neither
of
them
were
males
but
quite
the
contrary
they
got
no
answer
to
this
for
three
weeks
and
had
given
up
all
hope
and
come
to
the
depressing
conclusion
that
they
must
have
betrayed
their
want
of
intelligence
and
interestingness
right
away
when
one
day
a
letter
came
from
general
headquarters
in
france
addressed
both
the
miss
and
it
was
a
long
letter
pages
long
from
the
slightly
wounded
officer
telling
them
he
had
been
patched
up
again
and
sent
back
to
the
front
and
their
answer
to
his
advertisement
had
been
forwarded
to
him
there
and
that
he
had
had
heaps
of
other
answers
to
it
and
that
the
one
he
had
liked
best
of
all
was
theirs
and
that
some
day
he
hoped
when
he
was
back
again
and
able
to
drive
himself
to
show
them
how
glorious
motoring
was
if
their
mother
would
bring
them
quick
motoring
in
his
racing
car
sixty
miles
an
hour
motoring
flashing
through
the
wonders
of
the
new
forest
where
he
lived
and
then
there
was
a
long
bit
about
what
the
new
forest
must
be
looking
like
just
then
all
quiet
in
the
spring
sunshine
with
lovely
dappled
bits
of
shade
underneath
the
big
beeches
and
the
heather
just
coming
alive
and
all
the
winding
solitary
roads
so
full
of
peace
so
empty
of
noise
write
to
me
you
two
children
said
the
letter
at
the
end
you
no
idea
what
it
like
getting
letters
from
home
out
here
write
and
tell
me
what
you
do
and
what
the
garden
is
like
these
fine
afternoons
the
lilacs
must
be
nearly
done
but
i
sure
there
the
smell
of
them
still
about
and
i
sure
you
have
a
beautiful
green
lawn
and
tea
is
brought
out
on
to
it
and
there
no
sound
no
sort
of
sound
except
birds
and
you
two
laughing
and
i
daresay
a
jolly
dog
barking
somewhere
just
for
fun
and
not
because
he
angry
the
letter
was
signed
captain
john
desmond
and
there
was
a
scrawl
in
the
corner
at
the
end
it
for
jolly
little
english
kids
like
you
that
we
fighting
god
bless
you
write
to
me
again
soon
english
kids
like
us
they
looked
at
each
other
they
had
not
mentioned
their
belligerent
ancestry
in
their
letter
they
felt
uncomfortable
and
as
if
captain
desmond
were
fighting
for
them
as
it
were
under
false
pretences
they
also
wondered
why
he
should
conclude
they
were
kids
they
wrote
to
him
again
explaining
that
they
were
not
exactly
what
could
be
described
as
english
but
on
the
other
hand
neither
were
they
exactly
what
could
be
described
as
german
we
would
be
very
glad
indeed
if
we
were
really
they
added
but
after
their
letter
had
been
gone
only
a
few
days
they
saw
in
the
list
of
casualties
in
that
captain
john
desmond
had
been
killed
and
then
one
day
the
real
solution
was
revealed
and
it
was
revealed
to
uncle
arthur
as
he
sat
in
his
library
on
a
wet
sunday
morning
considering
his
troubles
in
detail
like
most
great
ideas
it
sprang
into
being
obvious
unquestionable
splendidly
simple
out
of
a
trifle
for
chancing
to
raise
his
heavy
and
disgusted
eyes
to
the
bookshelves
in
front
of
him
they
rested
on
one
particular
book
and
on
the
back
of
this
book
stood
out
in
big
gilt
letters
the
word
america
there
were
other
words
on
its
back
but
this
one
alone
stood
out
and
it
had
all
the
effect
of
a
revelation
there
that
was
it
of
course
that
was
the
way
out
why
the
devil
had
alice
thought
of
he
knew
some
americans
he
did
like
them
but
he
knew
them
and
he
would
write
to
them
or
alice
would
write
to
them
and
tell
them
the
twins
were
coming
he
would
give
the
twins
damn
it
nobody
could
say
that
was
handsome
especially
in
and
for
a
couple
of
girls
who
had
no
earthly
sort
of
claim
on
him
whatever
alice
might
choose
to
think
they
had
on
her
yet
it
was
such
a
confounded
situation
that
he
was
at
all
sure
he
would
come
under
the
defence
of
the
realm
act
by
giving
them
money
as
aiding
the
enemy
well
he
would
risk
that
he
would
risk
anything
to
be
rid
of
them
ship
off
that
was
the
thing
to
do
they
would
fall
on
their
feet
right
enough
over
there
america
still
swallowed
germans
without
making
a
face
uncle
arthur
reflected
for
a
moment
with
extreme
disgust
on
the
insensibility
of
the
american
palate
lost
their
chance
that
what
done
he
said
to
himself
for
this
was
and
america
had
not
yet
made
her
magnificent
entry
into
the
war
as
he
had
already
said
to
himself
a
hundred
times
lost
their
chance
of
coming
in
on
the
side
of
civilization
and
helping
sweep
the
world
up
tidy
of
barbarism
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
us
that
where
ought
to
have
been
races
duty
to
the
world
he
then
damned
the
americans
but
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
perceiving
that
if
they
had
been
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
him
and
england
he
would
have
been
able
to
send
them
his
wife
german
nieces
to
take
care
of
there
was
he
conceded
that
advantage
resulting
from
their
attitude
he
could
not
however
concede
any
others
at
luncheon
he
was
very
nearly
gay
it
was
terrible
to
see
uncle
arthur
very
nearly
gay
and
both
his
wife
and
the
twins
were
most
uncomfortable
i
wonder
what
the
matter
now
sighed
aunt
alice
to
herself
as
she
nervously
crumbled
her
toast
it
could
mean
nothing
good
arthur
in
such
spirits
on
a
wet
sunday
when
he
had
been
able
to
get
his
golf
and
the
cook
had
overdone
the
joint
chapter
iii
and
so
on
a
late
september
afternoon
the
sliding
away
from
her
moorings
relieved
uncle
arthur
of
his
burden
it
was
final
this
time
for
the
two
alien
enemies
once
out
of
it
would
not
be
let
into
england
again
till
after
the
war
the
enemies
themselves
knew
it
was
final
and
the
same
knowledge
that
made
uncle
arthur
feel
so
pleasant
as
he
walked
home
across
his
park
from
golf
to
tea
that
for
a
moment
he
was
actually
of
a
mind
to
kiss
aunt
alice
when
he
got
in
and
perhaps
even
address
her
in
the
language
of
resuscitated
passion
which
in
uncle
arthur
mouth
was
old
girl
an
idea
he
abandoned
however
in
case
it
should
make
her
and
tiresome
the
same
knowledge
that
produced
these
amiable
effects
in
uncle
arthur
made
his
alien
nieces
cling
very
close
together
as
they
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
hungrily
watching
the
people
on
the
wharf
for
they
loved
england
they
loved
it
with
the
love
of
youth
whose
enthusiasms
have
been
led
by
an
adored
teacher
always
in
one
direction
and
they
were
leaving
that
adored
teacher
their
mother
in
england
it
seemed
like
losing
her
a
second
time
to
go
away
so
far
away
and
leave
her
there
it
was
nonsense
they
knew
to
feel
like
that
she
was
with
them
just
the
same
wherever
they
went
now
she
would
be
with
them
and
they
could
hear
her
saying
at
that
very
moment
little
darlings
cry
but
it
was
a
gloomy
drizzling
afternoon
the
sort
of
afternoon
anybody
might
be
expected
to
cry
on
and
not
one
of
the
people
waving
handkerchiefs
were
waving
handkerchiefs
to
them
we
ought
to
have
hired
somebody
thought
eyeing
the
handkerchiefs
with
miserable
little
eyes
i
believe
i
gone
and
caught
a
cold
remarked
in
her
gentle
staid
voice
for
she
was
having
a
good
deal
of
bother
with
her
eyes
and
her
nose
and
could
no
longer
conceal
the
fact
that
she
was
sniffing
discreetly
did
look
at
her
then
she
suddenly
whipped
out
her
handkerchief
and
waved
it
violently
forgot
her
eyes
and
nose
and
craned
her
head
forward
who
are
you
waving
to
she
asked
astonished
cried
waving
who
where
who
are
you
talking
to
asked
has
any
one
come
to
see
us
off
cried
the
figures
on
the
wharf
were
getting
smaller
but
not
until
they
had
faded
into
a
blur
did
leave
off
waving
then
she
turned
round
and
put
her
arm
through
and
held
on
to
her
very
tight
for
a
minute
there
was
anybody
she
said
of
course
there
was
but
do
you
suppose
i
was
going
to
have
us
like
people
who
are
seen
off
and
she
drew
away
to
the
chairs
and
when
they
were
safely
in
them
and
rolled
up
to
their
chins
in
the
rug
she
added
that
man
and
then
stopped
what
man
standing
just
behind
us
was
there
a
man
asked
who
never
saw
men
any
more
than
she
in
her
brief
career
at
the
hospital
had
seen
pails
yes
looking
as
if
in
another
moment
he
be
sorry
for
us
said
sorry
for
us
repeated
roused
to
indignation
yes
did
you
ever
said
with
a
great
deal
of
energy
while
she
put
her
handkerchief
finally
and
sternly
away
that
she
did
ever
and
after
a
pause
remembering
one
of
her
many
new
responsibilities
and
anxieties
she
had
so
many
that
sometimes
for
a
time
she
did
remember
some
of
them
turned
her
head
to
and
fixing
a
worried
eye
on
her
said
you
wo
go
forgetting
your
bible
will
you
anna
my
bible
repeated
looking
blank
your
german
bible
the
bit
about
die
bösen
buben
locken
so
folge
sie
continued
to
look
blank
but
with
a
troubled
brow
said
again
you
wo
go
and
forget
that
will
you
anna
for
was
very
pretty
in
most
people
eyes
she
was
very
pretty
but
in
she
was
the
most
exquisite
creature
god
had
yet
succeeded
in
turning
out
concealed
this
conviction
from
her
she
would
have
told
her
for
worlds
she
considered
it
have
been
at
all
good
for
her
and
she
had
up
to
this
and
ever
since
they
could
both
remember
jeered
in
a
thoroughly
sisterly
fashion
at
her
defects
concentrating
particularly
on
her
nose
on
her
leanness
and
on
the
way
unless
constantly
reminded
not
to
she
drooped
but
secretly
considered
that
the
same
nose
that
on
her
own
face
made
no
sort
of
a
show
at
all
directly
it
got
on
to
somehow
was
the
dearest
nose
and
that
her
leanness
was
lovely
the
same
sort
of
slender
grace
her
mother
had
had
in
the
days
before
the
emaciation
that
was
its
last
phase
and
that
her
head
was
set
so
charmingly
on
her
neck
that
when
she
drooped
and
forgot
her
father
constant
injunction
to
sit
up
for
had
said
her
father
at
monotonously
regular
intervals
a
maiden
should
be
as
straight
as
a
she
only
seemed
to
fall
into
even
more
attractive
lines
than
when
she
did
and
now
that
alone
had
the
charge
of
looking
after
this
abstracted
and
so
charming
younger
sister
she
felt
it
her
duty
somehow
to
convey
to
her
while
tactfully
avoiding
putting
ideas
into
the
poor
child
head
which
might
make
her
conceited
that
it
behoved
her
to
conduct
herself
with
discretion
but
she
found
tact
a
ticklish
thing
the
most
difficult
thing
of
all
to
handle
successfully
and
on
this
occasion
hers
was
so
elaborate
and
so
carefully
wrapped
up
in
scriptural
language
and
german
scripture
at
that
that
slow
mind
did
succeed
in
disentangling
her
meaning
and
after
a
space
of
staring
at
her
with
a
mild
inquiry
in
her
eyes
she
decided
that
perhaps
she
had
got
one
she
was
much
too
polite
though
to
say
so
and
they
sat
in
silence
under
the
rug
till
the
whistled
and
stopped
and
began
hastily
to
make
conversation
about
christopher
and
columbus
she
was
ashamed
of
having
shown
so
much
of
her
woe
at
leaving
england
she
hoped
had
noticed
she
certainly
was
going
on
like
that
when
the
whistled
she
was
ashamed
that
it
only
who
jumped
and
the
amount
of
brightness
she
put
into
her
voice
when
she
told
it
was
pleasant
to
go
and
discover
america
was
such
that
that
young
lady
who
if
slow
was
sure
said
to
herself
poor
little
she
really
taking
it
dreadfully
to
heart
the
was
only
dropping
anchor
for
the
night
in
the
mersey
and
would
go
on
at
daybreak
they
gathered
this
from
the
talk
of
passengers
walking
up
and
down
the
deck
in
twos
and
threes
and
passing
and
repassing
the
chairs
containing
the
silent
figures
with
the
round
heads
that
might
be
either
the
heads
of
boys
or
of
girls
and
they
were
greatly
relieved
to
think
they
would
have
to
begin
and
be
for
some
hours
yet
so
could
we
walk
about
a
little
suggested
who
was
already
stiff
from
sitting
on
the
hard
cane
chair
but
aunt
alice
had
told
them
that
the
thing
to
do
on
board
a
ship
if
they
wished
as
she
was
sure
they
did
not
only
to
avoid
being
sick
but
also
conspicuous
was
to
sit
down
in
chairs
the
moment
the
ship
got
under
way
and
not
move
out
of
them
till
it
stopped
again
or
at
least
as
rarely
as
possible
amended
aunt
alice
who
had
never
herself
been
further
on
a
ship
than
to
calais
but
recognized
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
avoid
moving
sooner
or
later
if
it
was
new
york
you
were
going
to
two
such
young
girls
travelling
alone
should
be
seen
as
seldom
as
ever
you
can
manage
your
uncle
is
sending
you
for
that
very
reason
because
it
is
so
much
less
conspicuous
it
was
also
very
much
less
expensive
and
uncle
arthur
generosities
were
of
the
kind
that
suddenly
grow
impatient
and
leave
off
just
as
in
eating
he
was
as
he
said
for
plain
roast
and
boiled
and
messes
be
damned
so
in
benefactions
he
was
for
lump
sums
and
done
with
it
and
the
extras
the
driblets
the
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
that
were
necessary
or
were
alleged
by
aunt
alice
to
be
necessary
before
he
finally
got
rid
of
those
blasted
twins
annoyed
him
so
profoundly
that
when
it
came
to
taking
their
passage
he
could
hardly
be
got
not
to
send
them
in
the
steerage
this
was
too
much
however
for
aunt
alice
whose
maid
was
going
with
them
as
far
as
euston
and
therefore
would
know
what
sort
of
tickets
they
had
and
she
insisted
with
such
quiet
obstinacy
that
they
should
be
sent
that
uncle
arthur
at
last
split
the
difference
and
consented
to
make
it
second
to
her
maid
aunt
alice
also
explained
that
was
less
conspicuous
mindful
of
aunt
alice
words
hesitated
as
to
the
wisdom
of
walking
about
and
beginning
to
be
conspicuous
already
but
she
too
was
stiff
and
anything
the
matter
with
one
body
has
a
wonderful
effect
as
she
had
already
in
her
brief
career
had
numerous
occasions
to
observe
in
doing
away
with
prudent
determinations
so
after
cautiously
looking
round
the
corners
to
see
if
the
man
who
was
on
the
verge
of
being
sorry
for
them
were
nowhere
in
sight
they
walked
up
and
down
the
damp
dark
deck
and
the
motionlessness
and
silence
and
mist
gave
them
a
sensation
of
being
hung
in
some
strange
empty
hades
between
two
worlds
far
down
below
there
was
a
faint
splash
every
now
and
then
against
the
side
of
the
when
some
other
steamer
invisible
in
the
mist
felt
her
way
slowly
by
out
ahead
lay
the
sea
the
immense
uneasy
sea
that
was
to
last
ten
days
and
nights
before
they
got
to
the
other
side
hour
after
hour
of
it
hour
after
hour
of
tossing
across
it
further
and
further
away
and
forlorn
and
ghostly
as
the
ship
felt
it
yet
because
on
either
side
of
it
were
still
the
shores
of
england
did
seem
as
forlorn
and
ghostly
as
the
unknown
land
they
were
bound
for
for
suppose
inquired
of
who
had
been
privately
asking
herself
the
same
thing
america
did
like
them
suppose
the
same
sort
of
difficulties
were
waiting
for
them
over
there
that
had
dogged
their
footsteps
in
england
first
of
all
said
promptly
for
she
prided
herself
on
the
readiness
and
clearness
of
her
explanations
america
will
like
us
because
i
do
see
why
it
should
we
going
over
to
it
in
exactly
the
same
pleasant
spirit
and
do
you
go
forgetting
it
and
showing
your
disagreeable
side
that
the
dove
was
in
when
it
flew
across
the
waters
to
the
ark
and
with
olive
branches
in
our
beaks
just
the
same
as
the
dove
only
they
those
two
letters
to
uncle
friends
but
do
you
think
uncle
arthur
friends
began
who
had
great
doubts
as
to
everything
connected
with
uncle
arthur
and
secondly
continued
a
little
louder
for
she
going
to
be
interrupted
and
having
been
asked
a
question
liked
to
give
all
the
information
in
her
power
secondly
america
is
the
greatest
of
the
neutrals
except
the
and
is
bound
particularly
to
prize
us
because
we
so
unusually
and
peculiarly
neutral
what
ever
was
more
neutral
than
you
and
me
we
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
and
yet
at
the
same
time
we
both
remarked
that
it
sounded
rather
as
if
they
were
the
athanasian
creed
and
thirdly
went
on
waving
this
aside
there
waiting
for
us
over
there
which
is
a
very
nice
warm
thing
to
think
of
we
never
had
waiting
for
us
anywhere
in
our
lives
before
did
we
so
you
remember
that
and
do
get
grumbling
mildly
said
that
she
was
grumbling
but
that
she
could
help
thinking
what
a
great
deal
depended
on
the
goodwill
of
uncle
arthur
friends
and
wished
it
had
been
aunt
alice
friends
they
had
letters
to
instead
because
aunt
alice
friends
were
more
likely
to
like
her
rebuked
her
and
said
that
the
proper
spirit
in
which
to
start
on
a
great
adventure
was
one
of
faith
and
enthusiasm
and
that
one
did
have
doubts
said
she
had
any
doubts
really
but
that
she
was
very
hungry
not
having
had
anything
that
could
be
called
a
meal
since
breakfast
and
that
she
felt
like
the
sheep
in
lycidas
the
hungry
ones
who
looked
up
and
were
not
fed
and
she
quoted
the
lines
in
case
did
recollect
them
which
deplored
for
she
knew
the
lines
by
heart
and
if
there
was
any
quoting
to
be
done
liked
to
do
it
herself
and
said
she
felt
just
like
that
empty
said
and
yet
swollen
when
do
you
suppose
people
have
food
on
board
ships
i
do
believe
we
mind
nearly
so
much
about
oh
well
about
leaving
england
if
it
was
after
dinner
i
not
minding
leaving
england
said
quickly
at
least
not
more
than
just
proper
oh
no
more
am
i
of
course
said
airily
except
what
proper
and
even
if
we
were
feeling
it
said
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
which
of
course
we
not
dinner
make
any
difference
dinner
does
alter
fundamentals
but
it
helps
one
to
bear
them
said
bear
repeated
her
chin
in
the
air
we
have
got
much
to
bear
do
let
me
hear
you
talk
of
bearing
things
i
wo
after
dinner
promised
they
thought
perhaps
they
had
better
ask
somebody
whether
there
soon
be
something
to
eat
but
the
other
passengers
had
all
disappeared
they
were
by
themselves
on
the
gloomy
deck
and
there
were
no
lights
the
row
of
cabin
windows
along
the
wall
were
closely
shuttered
and
the
door
they
had
come
through
when
first
they
came
on
deck
was
shut
too
and
they
could
find
it
in
the
dark
it
seemed
so
odd
to
be
feeling
along
a
wall
for
a
door
they
knew
was
there
and
not
be
able
to
find
it
that
they
began
to
laugh
and
the
undiscoverable
door
cheered
them
up
more
than
anything
that
had
happened
since
seeing
the
last
of
uncle
arthur
it
like
a
game
said
patting
her
hands
softly
and
vainly
along
the
wall
beneath
the
shuttered
windows
it
like
something
in
in
wonderland
said
following
in
her
tracks
a
figure
loomed
through
the
mist
and
came
toward
them
they
left
off
patting
and
stiffened
into
straight
and
motionless
dignity
against
the
wall
till
it
should
have
passed
but
it
did
pass
it
was
a
male
figure
in
a
peaked
cap
probably
a
steward
they
thought
and
it
stopped
in
front
of
them
and
said
in
an
american
voice
hello
cast
rapidly
about
in
her
mind
for
the
proper
form
of
reply
to
hello
instinctively
responsive
to
example
murmured
hello
back
again
feeling
sure
that
nobody
ought
to
say
just
hello
to
people
they
had
never
seen
before
and
that
aunt
alice
would
think
they
had
brought
it
on
themselves
by
being
conspicuous
decided
that
perhaps
would
regulate
the
situation
and
said
it
you
ought
to
be
at
dinner
said
the
man
taking
no
notice
of
this
that
what
think
agreed
earnestly
can
you
please
tell
us
how
to
get
there
asked
still
distant
but
polite
for
she
too
very
much
wanted
to
know
but
tell
us
to
ask
the
captain
said
even
more
earnestly
no
said
because
we
wo
the
man
laughed
come
right
along
with
me
he
said
striding
on
and
they
followed
him
as
obediently
as
though
such
persons
as
possible
did
exist
first
voyage
i
guess
said
the
man
over
his
shoulder
yes
said
the
twins
a
little
breathlessly
for
the
man
legs
were
long
and
they
could
hardly
keep
up
with
him
english
said
the
man
ye
es
said
that
to
say
practically
panted
the
conscientious
what
say
said
the
man
still
striding
on
i
said
endeavoured
to
explain
hurrying
breathlessly
after
him
so
as
to
keep
within
reach
of
his
ear
practically
ah
said
the
man
and
after
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
pantings
for
breath
of
the
twins
he
added
mother
with
you
they
did
say
anything
to
that
it
seemed
such
a
dreadful
question
to
have
to
answer
and
luckily
he
did
repeat
it
but
having
got
to
the
door
they
had
been
searching
for
opened
it
and
stepped
into
the
bright
light
inside
and
putting
out
his
arm
behind
him
pulled
them
in
one
after
the
other
over
the
high
wooden
inside
was
the
same
stewardess
they
had
seen
earlier
in
the
afternoon
engaged
in
heatedly
describing
what
sounded
like
grievances
to
an
official
in
buttons
who
seemed
indifferent
she
stopped
suddenly
when
the
man
appeared
and
the
official
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
and
became
alert
and
attentive
and
the
stewardess
hastily
picked
up
a
tray
she
had
set
down
and
began
to
move
away
along
a
passage
the
man
however
briefly
called
hi
and
she
turned
round
and
came
back
even
more
quickly
than
she
had
tried
to
go
you
see
explained
in
a
pleased
whisper
to
it
hi
she
answers
to
yes
agreed
it
waste
of
good
circumlocutions
to
throw
them
away
on
her
show
these
young
ladies
the
said
the
man
yes
sir
said
the
stewardess
as
polite
as
you
please
he
nodded
to
them
with
a
smile
that
developed
for
some
reason
into
a
laugh
and
turned
away
and
beckoned
to
the
official
to
follow
him
and
went
out
again
into
the
night
who
was
that
nice
man
inquired
following
the
stewardess
down
a
broad
flight
of
stairs
that
smelt
of
and
and
cooking
all
mixed
up
together
and
please
said
with
mild
severity
do
tell
us
to
ask
the
captain
because
we
really
do
know
better
than
that
i
thought
you
must
be
relations
said
the
stewardess
we
are
said
we
twins
the
stewardess
stared
twins
what
of
she
asked
what
of
echoed
why
of
each
other
of
course
i
meant
relations
of
the
captain
said
the
stewardess
shortly
eyeing
them
with
more
disfavour
than
ever
you
seem
to
have
the
captain
greatly
on
your
mind
said
he
is
no
relation
of
ours
you
not
even
friends
then
asked
the
stewardess
pausing
to
stare
round
at
them
at
a
turn
in
the
stairs
as
they
followed
her
down
of
course
we
friends
said
with
some
heat
do
you
suppose
we
quarrel
no
i
did
suppose
you
quarrelled
with
the
captain
said
the
stewardess
tartly
not
on
board
this
ship
anyway
she
did
know
which
of
the
two
she
disliked
most
the
short
girl
or
the
long
girl
you
seem
to
be
greatly
obsessed
by
the
captain
said
gently
obsessed
repeated
the
stewardess
tossing
her
head
she
was
unacquainted
with
the
word
but
instantly
suspected
it
of
containing
a
reflection
on
her
respectability
i
been
a
widow
off
and
on
for
ten
years
now
she
said
angrily
and
i
guess
it
would
take
more
than
even
the
captain
to
obsess
they
had
reached
the
glass
doors
leading
into
the
and
the
stewardess
having
carried
out
her
orders
paused
before
indignantly
leaving
them
and
going
upstairs
again
to
say
if
you
friends
what
do
you
want
to
know
his
name
for
then
whose
name
asked
the
captain
said
the
stewardess
we
do
want
to
know
the
captain
name
said
patiently
we
do
want
to
know
anything
about
the
captain
then
began
the
stewardess
she
restrained
herself
however
and
merely
bitterly
remarking
that
gentleman
the
captain
went
upstairs
and
left
them
was
the
first
to
recover
you
see
we
took
your
advice
she
called
up
after
her
trying
to
soften
her
heart
for
it
was
evident
that
for
some
reason
her
heart
was
hardened
by
flattery
you
us
to
ask
the
captain
chapter
iv
in
their
berths
that
night
before
they
went
to
sleep
it
occurred
to
them
that
perhaps
what
was
the
matter
with
the
stewardess
was
that
she
needed
a
tip
at
first
with
their
recent
experiences
fresh
in
their
minds
they
thought
that
she
was
probably
passionately
and
had
already
detected
all
those
junkers
in
their
past
and
accordingly
could
endure
them
then
they
remembered
how
aunt
alice
had
said
you
will
have
to
give
your
stewardess
a
little
something
this
had
greatly
perturbed
them
at
the
time
for
up
to
then
they
had
been
in
the
easy
position
of
the
tipped
rather
than
the
tippers
and
anyhow
they
had
no
idea
what
one
gave
stewardesses
neither
it
appeared
had
aunt
alice
for
on
being
questioned
she
said
vaguely
that
as
it
was
an
american
boat
they
were
going
on
she
supposed
it
would
have
to
be
american
money
which
was
dollars
and
she
did
know
much
about
dollars
except
that
you
divided
them
by
four
and
multiplied
them
by
five
or
else
it
was
the
other
way
about
and
when
feeling
still
uninformed
they
had
begged
her
to
tell
them
why
one
did
that
she
said
it
was
the
quickest
way
of
finding
out
what
a
dollar
really
was
and
would
they
mind
not
talking
any
more
for
a
little
while
because
her
head
ached
the
tips
they
had
seen
administered
during
their
short
lives
had
all
been
given
at
the
end
of
things
not
at
the
beginning
but
americans
aunt
alice
told
them
were
in
some
respects
in
spite
of
their
talking
english
different
and
perhaps
they
were
different
just
on
this
point
and
liked
to
be
tipped
at
both
ends
wanted
to
crane
out
her
head
and
call
up
to
and
ask
her
whether
she
did
think
that
might
be
so
but
was
afraid
of
disturbing
the
people
in
the
opposite
berths
was
in
the
top
berth
on
their
side
of
the
cabin
and
as
the
elder
and
accordingly
as
she
explained
to
needing
more
comfort
in
the
lower
one
on
the
opposite
side
were
two
similar
berths
each
containing
as
whispered
after
peeping
cautiously
through
their
closed
curtains
for
at
first
on
coming
in
after
dinner
to
go
to
bed
the
cabin
seemed
empty
except
for
inanimate
things
like
clothes
hanging
up
and
an
immense
smell
its
human
freight
they
were
awed
by
this
discovery
for
the
human
freight
was
motionless
and
speechless
and
yet
made
none
of
the
noises
suggesting
sleep
they
unpacked
and
undressed
as
silently
and
quickly
as
possible
but
it
was
very
difficult
for
there
seemed
to
be
no
room
for
anything
not
even
for
themselves
every
now
and
then
they
glanced
a
little
uneasily
at
the
closed
curtains
which
bulged
and
sniffed
cautiously
and
delicately
trying
to
decide
what
the
smell
exactly
was
it
appeared
to
be
a
mixture
of
the
sauce
one
had
with
plum
pudding
at
christmas
and
german
bedrooms
in
the
morning
it
was
a
smell
they
did
like
the
idea
of
sleeping
with
but
they
saw
no
way
of
getting
air
they
thought
of
ringing
for
the
stewardess
and
asking
her
to
open
a
window
though
they
could
see
no
window
but
came
to
the
conclusion
it
was
better
not
to
stir
her
up
not
yet
at
least
not
till
they
had
correctly
diagnosed
what
was
the
matter
with
her
they
said
nothing
out
loud
for
fear
of
disturbing
whatever
it
was
behind
the
curtains
but
they
knew
what
each
was
thinking
for
one
is
as
they
had
long
ago
found
out
a
twin
for
nothing
there
was
a
slight
scuffle
before
was
safely
hoisted
up
into
her
berth
her
legs
hanging
helplessly
down
for
some
time
after
the
rest
of
her
was
in
it
and
who
had
already
neatly
inserted
herself
into
her
own
berth
after
watching
these
legs
in
silence
and
fighting
a
desire
to
give
them
a
tug
and
see
what
would
happen
had
to
get
out
at
last
on
hearing
begin
to
make
sounds
up
there
as
though
she
were
choking
and
push
them
up
in
after
her
her
head
was
then
on
a
level
with
berth
and
she
could
see
how
having
got
her
legs
again
did
attempt
to
do
anything
with
them
in
the
way
of
orderly
arrangement
beneath
the
blankets
but
lay
huddled
in
an
irregular
heap
screwing
her
eyes
up
very
tight
and
stuffing
one
of
her
pigtails
into
her
mouth
and
evidently
struggling
with
what
appeared
to
be
an
attack
of
immoderate
and
mirth
observed
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
was
suddenly
seized
herself
with
a
dreadful
desire
to
laugh
and
with
a
hasty
glance
round
at
the
bulging
curtains
scrambled
back
into
her
own
berth
and
pulled
the
sheet
over
her
mouth
she
was
sobering
herself
by
going
over
her
different
responsibilities
checking
them
off
on
her
fingers
the
two
notes
under
her
pillow
for
extra
expenses
till
they
were
united
in
new
york
to
their
capital
the
tickets
the
passports
and
when
two
thick
fair
pigtails
appeared
dangling
over
the
edge
of
her
berth
followed
by
head
you
forgotten
to
turn
out
the
light
whispered
her
eyelashes
still
wet
from
her
late
attack
and
stretching
her
neck
still
further
down
till
her
face
was
scarlet
with
the
effort
and
the
blood
rushing
into
it
she
expressed
a
conviction
to
that
the
human
freight
behind
the
curtains
judging
from
the
suspicious
negativeness
of
its
behaviour
had
no
business
in
their
cabin
at
all
and
was
really
stowaways
german
stowaways
added
nodding
her
head
emphatically
which
was
very
skilful
of
her
thought
considering
that
it
was
upside
down
stowaways
whispered
sniffing
expressively
though
cautiously
raised
herself
on
her
elbows
and
stared
across
at
the
bulging
curtains
they
certainly
were
very
motionless
and
much
curved
in
spite
of
herself
her
flesh
began
to
creep
a
little
they
men
whispered
now
dangerously
congested
stowaways
are
there
had
been
no
one
in
the
cabin
when
first
they
came
on
board
and
took
their
things
down
and
they
had
been
in
it
since
till
they
came
to
bed
men
whispered
again
with
a
delicate
expressive
sniff
nonsense
whispered
stoutly
men
never
come
into
cabins
and
there
skirts
on
the
hooks
disguise
whispered
nodding
again
spies
disguise
she
seemed
quite
to
be
enjoying
her
own
horrible
suggestions
take
your
head
back
into
the
berth
ordered
quickly
for
seemed
to
be
on
the
very
brink
of
an
apoplectic
fit
who
was
herself
beginning
to
feel
a
little
inconvenienced
obeyed
and
was
thrilled
to
see
presently
very
cautiously
emerge
from
underneath
her
and
on
her
bare
feet
creep
across
to
the
opposite
side
she
knew
her
to
be
valiant
to
recklessness
she
sat
up
to
watch
her
eyes
round
with
interest
did
go
straight
across
but
proceeded
slowly
with
several
pauses
to
direct
her
steps
toward
the
of
the
berths
having
got
there
she
stood
still
a
moment
listening
and
then
putting
a
careful
finger
between
the
curtain
of
the
lower
berth
and
its
frame
drew
it
the
smallest
crack
aside
and
peeped
in
instantly
she
started
back
letting
go
the
curtain
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
out
loud
turning
very
red
i
i
thought
attentive
in
her
berth
felt
a
cold
thrill
rush
down
her
back
no
sound
came
from
the
berth
on
the
other
side
any
more
than
before
the
raid
on
it
and
returned
quicker
than
she
had
gone
she
just
stopped
on
the
way
to
switch
off
the
light
and
then
felt
along
the
edge
of
berth
till
she
got
to
her
head
and
pulling
it
near
her
by
its
left
pigtail
whispered
with
her
mouth
close
to
its
left
ear
wide
awake
watching
me
all
the
time
not
a
man
fat
and
she
crawled
into
her
berth
feeling
unnerved
chapter
v
the
lady
in
the
opposite
berth
was
german
and
so
was
the
lady
in
the
berth
above
her
their
husbands
were
american
but
that
did
make
them
less
german
nothing
ever
makes
a
german
less
german
explained
to
except
replied
a
judicious
dilution
of
their
blood
by
the
right
kind
of
mother
yes
said
only
to
be
found
in
england
this
conversation
did
take
place
till
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
by
which
time
already
knew
about
the
human
freight
being
germans
for
one
of
their
own
submarines
came
after
the
and
no
one
was
quite
so
loud
in
expression
of
terror
and
dislike
as
the
two
germans
they
demanded
to
be
saved
first
on
the
ground
that
they
were
germans
they
repudiated
their
husbands
and
said
marriage
was
nothing
compared
to
how
one
had
been
born
the
curtains
of
their
berths
till
then
so
carefully
closed
suddenly
yawned
open
and
the
berths
gave
up
their
contents
just
as
if
remarked
afterwards
to
it
was
the
resurrection
and
the
berths
were
riven
sepulchres
chucking
up
their
dead
this
happened
at
ten
the
next
morning
when
the
was
pitching
about
off
the
southwest
coast
of
ireland
the
twins
waking
about
seven
found
with
a
pained
surprise
that
they
were
not
where
they
had
been
dreaming
they
were
in
the
sunlit
garden
at
home
playing
tennis
happily
if
a
little
violently
but
in
a
chilly
yet
stuffy
place
that
kept
on
tilting
itself
upside
down
they
lay
listening
to
the
groans
coming
from
the
opposite
berths
and
uneasily
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
they
too
began
to
groan
raised
her
head
once
with
the
intention
of
asking
if
she
could
help
at
all
but
dropped
it
back
again
on
to
the
pillow
and
shut
her
eyes
tight
and
lay
as
quiet
as
the
ship
would
let
her
did
even
raise
her
head
she
felt
so
very
uncomfortable
at
eight
the
stewardess
looked
in
the
same
stewardess
they
languidly
noted
with
whom
already
they
had
had
two
encounters
for
it
happened
that
this
was
one
of
the
cabins
she
attended
to
and
said
that
if
anybody
wanted
breakfast
they
had
better
be
quick
or
it
would
be
over
breakfast
cried
the
top
berth
opposite
in
a
tone
and
instantly
was
sick
the
stewardess
withdrew
her
head
and
banged
the
door
to
and
the
twins
in
their
uneasy
berths
carefully
keeping
their
eyes
shut
so
as
not
to
witness
the
behaviour
of
the
sides
and
ceiling
of
the
cabin
feebly
marvelled
at
the
stewardess
for
suggesting
being
quick
to
persons
who
were
being
constantly
stood
on
their
heads
and
breakfast
they
shuddered
and
thought
of
other
things
of
fresh
sweet
air
and
of
the
scent
of
pinks
and
apricots
warm
with
the
sun
at
ten
the
stewardess
came
in
again
this
time
right
in
and
with
determination
in
every
gesture
come
come
she
said
addressing
the
twins
and
through
them
talking
at
the
heaving
and
groaning
occupants
of
the
other
side
you
give
way
like
this
what
you
want
is
to
be
out
of
bed
you
must
get
up
and
go
on
deck
and
how
the
cabin
to
get
done
if
you
stay
in
it
all
the
time
the
one
particularly
addressed
because
she
was
more
on
the
right
level
for
conversation
than
who
could
only
see
the
stewardess
apron
turned
her
head
away
and
murmured
that
she
care
come
come
said
the
stewardess
besides
there
drill
at
and
you
got
to
be
present
her
eyes
shut
again
murmured
that
she
did
care
come
come
said
the
stewardess
orders
are
orders
every
soul
on
the
ship
sick
or
not
has
got
to
be
present
at
drill
oh
i
not
a
soul
murmured
who
felt
at
that
moment
how
particularly
she
was
a
body
while
the
opposite
berths
redoubled
their
groans
come
come
said
the
stewardess
then
the
whistled
five
times
and
the
stewardess
turned
pale
for
a
brief
space
before
they
understood
what
had
happened
the
twins
supposed
she
was
going
to
be
sick
but
it
was
that
that
was
the
matter
with
her
for
after
a
moment
staring
at
nothing
with
horror
on
her
face
she
pounced
on
them
and
pulled
them
bodily
out
of
their
berths
regardless
by
which
end
and
threw
them
on
the
floor
anyhow
then
she
plunged
about
and
produced
then
she
rushed
down
the
passage
flinging
open
the
doors
of
the
other
cabins
then
she
whirled
back
again
and
tried
to
tie
the
twins
into
their
but
with
hands
that
shook
so
that
the
strings
immediately
came
undone
again
and
all
the
time
she
was
calling
out
quick
quick
quick
there
was
a
great
tramping
of
feet
on
deck
and
cries
and
shouting
the
curtains
of
the
opposite
berths
yawned
asunder
and
out
came
the
germans
astonishingly
cured
of
their
and
struggled
vigorously
into
their
and
then
into
fur
coats
and
had
the
fur
coats
instantly
pulled
off
again
by
a
very
energetic
steward
who
ran
in
and
said
fur
coats
in
the
water
were
a
steward
so
much
bent
on
saving
people
that
he
began
to
pull
off
the
other
things
the
german
ladies
had
on
as
well
saying
while
he
pulled
disregarding
their
protests
that
in
the
water
mother
nature
was
the
best
mother
nature
mother
nature
said
the
steward
pulling
and
he
was
only
stopped
just
in
the
nick
of
time
by
the
stewardess
rushing
in
again
and
seeing
what
was
happening
to
the
helpless
germans
even
at
that
moment
explanatory
pointed
out
to
who
had
already
grasped
the
fact
that
no
doubt
there
was
a
submarine
somewhere
about
the
german
ladies
seizing
their
valuables
from
beneath
their
pillows
in
spite
of
the
steward
assuring
them
they
would
want
them
in
the
water
demanded
to
be
taken
up
and
somehow
signalled
to
the
submarine
which
would
never
dare
do
anything
to
a
ship
containing
its
own
flesh
and
blood
and
an
american
ship
too
there
must
be
some
awful
mistake
but
anyhow
they
must
be
saved
there
would
be
terrible
trouble
that
they
could
assure
the
steward
and
the
twins
and
the
scurrying
down
the
passage
if
america
allowed
two
germans
to
be
destroyed
and
anyhow
they
would
insist
on
having
their
passage
money
refunded
the
german
ladies
departed
down
the
passage
very
incoherent
and
very
unhappy
but
no
longer
sick
and
clinging
to
the
edge
of
her
berth
feeling
too
miserable
to
mind
about
the
submarine
feebly
wondered
while
the
steward
tied
her
properly
into
her
at
the
cure
effected
in
them
seemed
cured
too
for
she
was
buttoning
a
coat
round
shoulders
and
generally
seemed
busy
and
brisk
ending
by
not
even
forgetting
their
precious
little
bag
of
money
and
tickets
and
passports
and
fastening
it
round
her
neck
in
spite
of
the
steward
assuring
her
that
it
would
drag
her
down
in
the
water
like
a
stone
tied
to
a
kitten
you
a
cheerful
man
are
you
said
as
he
pushed
them
out
of
the
cabin
and
along
the
corridor
holding
up
on
her
feet
who
seemed
quite
unable
to
run
alone
the
steward
did
answer
but
caught
hold
of
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
carried
her
up
them
and
then
having
got
her
on
deck
propped
her
in
a
corner
near
the
allotted
to
the
set
of
cabins
they
were
in
and
darted
away
and
in
a
minute
was
back
again
with
a
big
coat
which
he
wrapped
round
her
may
as
well
be
comfortable
till
you
do
begin
to
drown
he
said
briskly
but
mind
you
do
forget
to
throw
it
off
missie
the
minute
you
feel
the
water
slid
down
on
to
the
deck
her
head
leaning
against
the
wall
her
eyes
shut
a
picture
of
complete
indifference
to
whatever
might
be
going
to
happen
next
her
face
was
now
as
white
as
the
frill
of
the
that
straggled
out
from
beneath
her
coat
for
the
journey
from
the
cabin
to
the
deck
had
altogether
finished
her
was
thankful
that
she
felt
too
ill
to
be
afraid
her
own
heart
was
black
with
despair
despair
that
the
dear
and
beautiful
one
should
presently
at
any
moment
be
thrown
into
that
awful
heaving
water
and
certainly
be
hurt
and
frightened
before
she
was
choked
out
of
life
she
sat
down
beside
her
getting
as
close
as
possible
to
keep
her
warm
her
own
twin
her
own
beloved
twin
she
took
her
cold
hands
and
put
them
away
beneath
the
coat
the
steward
had
brought
she
slid
an
arm
round
her
and
laid
her
cheek
against
her
sleeve
so
that
she
should
know
somebody
was
there
somebody
who
loved
her
what
the
of
it
all
were
we
born
she
wondered
staring
at
the
hideous
gray
waves
as
they
swept
up
into
sight
over
the
side
of
the
ship
and
away
again
as
the
ship
rose
up
and
at
the
wet
deck
and
the
torn
sky
and
the
passengers
in
their
collected
together
round
the
nobody
said
anything
except
the
german
ladies
they
indeed
kept
up
a
constant
wail
the
others
were
silent
the
men
mostly
smoking
cigarettes
the
women
holding
their
fluttering
wraps
about
them
all
of
them
staring
out
to
sea
watching
for
the
track
of
the
torpedo
to
appear
one
shot
had
been
fired
already
and
had
missed
the
ship
was
under
every
ounce
of
steam
she
could
lay
on
an
official
stood
by
the
which
was
ready
with
water
in
it
and
provisions
that
the
submarine
must
be
mad
as
the
official
remarked
to
fire
on
an
american
ship
did
console
anybody
and
his
further
assurance
that
the
matter
would
not
be
allowed
to
rest
there
left
them
cold
they
felt
too
sure
that
in
all
probability
they
themselves
were
going
to
rest
there
down
underneath
that
repulsive
icy
water
after
a
struggle
that
was
going
to
be
unpleasant
the
man
who
had
roused
indignation
as
the
ship
left
the
by
looking
as
though
he
were
soon
going
to
be
sorry
for
her
came
across
from
the
first
class
where
his
was
to
watch
for
the
track
of
the
expected
torpedo
and
caught
sight
of
the
twins
huddled
in
their
corner
did
see
him
for
she
was
staring
with
wide
eyes
out
at
the
desolate
welter
of
water
and
cloud
and
thinking
of
home
the
home
that
was
that
used
to
be
till
such
a
little
while
ago
the
home
that
now
seemed
to
have
been
so
amazingly
so
unbelievably
beautiful
and
blest
with
its
daily
life
of
love
and
laughter
and
of
easy
confidence
that
was
going
to
be
just
as
good
happiness
had
been
the
ordinary
condition
there
a
simple
matter
of
course
its
place
was
taken
now
by
courage
felt
sick
at
all
this
courage
there
was
about
there
should
be
no
occasion
for
it
there
should
be
no
horrors
to
face
no
cruelties
to
endure
why
could
brotherly
love
continue
why
must
people
get
killing
each
other
she
for
her
part
would
be
behind
nobody
in
courage
and
in
the
defying
of
a
fate
that
could
behave
as
she
felt
so
very
unlike
her
idea
of
anything
even
remotely
decent
but
it
ought
to
be
necessary
this
constant
condition
of
it
was
waste
of
effort
waste
of
time
waste
of
life
oh
the
of
it
all
she
thought
rebellious
and
bewildered
have
some
brandy
said
the
man
pouring
out
a
little
into
a
small
cup
turned
her
eyes
on
him
without
moving
the
rest
of
her
she
recognized
him
he
was
going
to
be
sorry
for
them
again
he
had
much
better
be
sorry
for
himself
now
she
thought
because
he
just
as
much
as
they
were
was
bound
for
a
watery
bier
thank
you
she
said
distantly
for
not
only
did
she
hate
the
smell
of
brandy
but
aunt
alice
had
enjoined
her
with
peculiar
strictness
on
no
account
to
talk
to
strange
men
i
do
drink
then
i
give
the
other
one
some
said
the
man
she
too
said
not
changing
her
position
but
keeping
a
drearily
watchful
eye
on
him
is
a
total
abstainer
well
i
go
and
fetch
some
of
your
warm
things
for
you
tell
me
where
your
cabin
is
you
have
got
enough
on
thank
you
said
distantly
we
have
quite
enough
on
considering
the
occasion
we
dressed
for
drowning
the
man
laughed
and
said
there
would
be
no
drowning
and
that
they
had
a
splendid
captain
and
were
outdistancing
the
submarine
hand
over
fist
did
believe
him
and
suspected
him
of
supposing
her
to
be
in
need
of
cheering
but
a
gleam
of
comfort
did
in
spite
of
herself
steal
into
her
heart
he
went
away
and
presently
came
back
with
a
blanket
and
some
pillows
if
you
sit
on
the
floor
he
said
stuffing
the
pillows
behind
their
backs
during
which
did
open
her
eyes
and
her
head
hung
about
so
limply
that
it
looked
as
if
it
might
at
any
moment
roll
off
you
may
at
least
be
as
comfortable
as
you
can
pointed
out
while
she
helped
him
arrange
indifferent
head
on
the
pillow
that
she
saw
little
use
in
being
comfortable
just
a
minute
or
two
before
drowning
drowning
be
hanged
said
the
man
that
how
uncle
arthur
used
to
talk
said
feeling
suddenly
quite
at
home
except
that
would
have
said
be
damned
the
man
laughed
is
he
dead
he
asked
busy
with
head
which
defied
their
united
efforts
to
make
it
hold
itself
up
dead
echoed
to
whom
the
idea
of
uncle
arthur
ever
being
anything
so
quiet
as
dead
and
not
able
to
say
any
swear
words
for
such
a
long
time
as
eternity
seemed
very
odd
you
said
he
to
talk
like
that
oh
no
he
not
dead
at
all
quite
the
contrary
the
man
laughed
again
and
having
got
head
arranged
in
a
position
that
at
least
as
pointed
out
had
some
sort
of
in
it
he
asked
who
they
were
with
looked
at
him
with
as
much
defiant
independence
as
she
could
manage
to
somebody
who
was
putting
a
pillow
behind
her
back
he
was
going
to
be
sorry
for
them
she
saw
it
coming
he
was
going
to
say
you
poor
things
or
words
to
that
effect
that
what
the
people
round
uncle
arthur
had
said
to
them
that
what
everybody
had
said
to
them
since
the
war
began
and
aunt
alice
friends
had
said
it
to
her
too
because
she
had
to
have
her
nieces
live
with
her
and
no
doubt
uncle
arthur
friends
who
played
golf
with
him
had
said
it
to
him
as
well
except
that
probably
they
put
in
a
damn
so
as
to
make
it
clearer
for
him
and
said
you
poor
damned
thing
or
something
like
that
and
she
was
sick
of
the
very
words
poor
things
poor
things
indeed
we
with
each
other
she
said
briefly
lifting
her
chin
well
i
do
think
that
enough
said
the
man
not
half
enough
you
ought
to
have
a
mother
or
something
ca
have
mothers
said
very
defiantly
indeed
tears
rushing
into
her
eyes
the
man
tucked
the
blanket
round
their
resistless
legs
there
now
he
said
that
better
what
the
good
of
catching
your
deaths
glad
that
he
had
gone
on
about
mothers
said
that
with
so
much
death
imminent
catching
any
of
it
no
longer
seemed
to
her
particularly
to
matter
and
the
man
laughed
and
pulled
over
a
chair
and
sat
down
beside
her
she
did
know
what
he
saw
anywhere
in
that
dreadful
situation
to
laugh
at
but
just
the
sound
of
a
laugh
was
extraordinarily
comforting
it
made
one
feel
quite
different
wholesome
again
like
waking
up
to
sunshine
and
one
morning
bath
and
breakfast
after
a
nightmare
he
seemed
altogether
a
very
comforting
man
she
liked
him
to
sit
near
them
she
hoped
he
was
a
good
man
aunt
alice
had
said
there
were
very
few
good
men
hardly
any
in
fact
except
one
husband
but
this
one
did
seem
one
of
the
few
exceptions
and
she
thought
that
by
now
he
having
brought
them
all
those
pillows
he
could
no
longer
come
under
the
heading
of
strange
men
when
he
was
looking
she
put
out
her
hand
secretly
and
touched
his
coat
where
he
would
feel
it
it
comforted
her
to
touch
his
coat
she
hoped
aunt
alice
would
have
disapproved
of
seeing
her
sitting
side
by
side
with
him
and
liking
it
aunt
alice
had
been
as
her
custom
was
vague
when
having
given
her
the
desired
promise
not
to
talk
or
let
talk
to
strange
men
and
desiring
to
collect
any
available
information
for
her
guidance
in
her
new
responsible
position
had
asked
but
when
are
men
strange
when
you
married
them
said
aunt
alice
after
that
of
course
you
love
them
and
she
sighed
heavily
for
it
was
chapter
vi
nothing
more
was
seen
of
the
submarine
the
german
ladies
were
certain
the
captain
had
somehow
let
them
know
he
had
them
on
board
and
were
as
full
of
the
credit
of
having
saved
the
ship
as
if
it
had
been
sodom
and
gomorrah
instead
of
a
ship
and
they
the
one
just
man
whose
presence
would
have
saved
those
cities
if
he
had
been
in
them
and
the
american
passengers
were
equally
sure
that
the
submarine
on
thinking
it
over
had
decided
that
president
wilson
was
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
and
had
gone
in
search
of
some
prey
which
would
not
have
the
might
and
majesty
of
america
at
its
back
as
the
day
went
on
and
the
left
off
the
relief
of
those
on
board
was
the
relief
of
a
reprieve
from
death
almost
everybody
was
cured
of
and
quite
everybody
was
ready
to
overwhelm
his
neighbour
with
cordiality
and
benevolence
rich
people
did
mind
poor
people
and
came
along
from
the
first
class
and
talked
to
them
just
as
if
they
had
been
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
themselves
a
billionairess
native
to
chicago
who
had
crossed
the
atlantic
forty
times
without
speaking
to
a
soul
an
achievement
she
was
as
justly
proud
of
as
an
artist
is
of
his
best
creations
actually
asked
somebody
in
a
dingy
mackintosh
whose
little
boy
still
looked
pale
if
he
had
been
frightened
and
an
exclusive
young
man
from
boston
talked
quite
a
long
while
to
an
english
lady
without
first
having
made
sure
that
she
was
what
could
have
been
more
like
heaven
the
tone
on
the
that
day
was
very
like
what
the
tone
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
must
be
in
its
simple
politeness
and
so
you
see
said
who
was
fond
of
philosophizing
in
season
and
out
of
season
and
particularly
out
of
season
how
good
comes
out
of
evil
she
made
this
observation
about
four
in
the
afternoon
to
in
an
interval
of
absence
on
the
part
of
mr
twist
such
the
amiable
stranger
had
told
them
was
his
name
who
had
gone
to
see
about
tea
being
brought
up
to
them
and
able
by
now
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
the
hours
of
fresh
air
having
done
their
work
smiled
the
ready
watery
foolishly
happy
smile
of
the
convalescent
it
was
so
nice
not
to
feel
ill
it
was
so
nice
not
to
have
to
be
saved
if
she
had
been
able
to
talk
much
she
would
have
philosophized
too
about
the
number
and
size
of
one
negative
blessings
all
the
things
one
has
got
all
the
very
horrid
things
why
there
no
end
to
them
once
you
begin
to
count
up
she
thought
waterily
happy
and
yet
people
grumble
was
in
that
beatific
convalescent
mood
in
which
one
is
sure
one
will
never
grumble
again
she
smiled
at
anybody
who
happened
to
pass
by
and
catch
her
eye
she
would
have
smiled
just
like
that
with
just
that
friendly
boneless
familiarity
at
the
devil
if
he
had
appeared
or
even
at
uncle
arthur
himself
the
twins
as
a
result
of
the
submarine
activities
were
having
the
pleasantest
day
they
had
had
for
months
it
was
the
realization
of
this
that
caused
remark
about
good
coming
out
of
evil
the
background
she
could
not
but
perceive
was
a
very
odd
one
for
their
pleasantest
day
for
months
a
rolling
steamer
and
a
cold
wind
flicking
at
them
round
the
corner
but
backgrounds
she
pointed
out
to
who
smiled
her
agreement
broadly
and
instantly
are
negligible
things
it
is
what
goes
on
in
front
of
them
that
matters
of
what
earthly
use
for
instance
had
been
those
splendid
summer
afternoons
in
the
perfect
woods
and
gardens
that
so
beautifully
framed
in
uncle
arthur
no
use
agreed
smiling
fatuously
in
the
middle
of
them
was
uncle
arthur
you
always
got
to
him
in
the
end
nodded
and
shook
her
head
and
was
all
feeble
agreement
she
and
had
been
more
hopelessly
miserable
remarked
wandering
about
the
loveliness
that
belonged
to
him
than
they
could
ever
have
dreamed
was
possible
she
reminded
how
they
used
to
rub
their
eyes
to
try
and
see
more
clearly
for
surely
these
means
of
happiness
these
elaborate
arrangements
for
it
all
round
them
could
be
for
nothing
there
must
be
some
of
it
somewhere
if
only
they
could
discover
where
and
there
was
none
not
a
trace
of
it
not
even
the
faintest
little
swish
of
its
skirts
left
off
talking
and
became
lost
in
memories
for
a
long
time
she
remembered
she
had
told
herself
it
was
her
mother
death
blotting
the
light
out
of
life
but
one
day
said
aloud
that
it
was
uncle
arthur
and
knew
it
was
true
their
death
was
something
so
tender
so
beautiful
that
terrible
as
it
was
to
them
to
be
left
without
her
they
yet
felt
raised
up
by
it
somehow
raised
on
to
a
higher
level
than
where
they
had
been
before
closer
in
their
hearts
to
real
things
to
real
values
but
uncle
arthur
came
into
possession
of
their
lives
as
a
consequence
of
that
death
and
he
had
towered
up
between
them
and
every
glimpse
of
the
sun
suddenly
there
was
no
such
thing
as
freedom
and
laughter
suddenly
everything
one
said
and
did
was
wrong
and
you
need
think
had
said
wisely
that
he
like
that
because
we
germans
or
to
be
germans
she
amended
it
because
he
uncle
arthur
look
at
aunt
alice
not
a
german
and
yet
look
at
her
and
had
looked
at
aunt
alice
though
only
in
her
mind
eye
for
at
that
moment
the
twins
were
three
miles
away
in
a
wood
picnicking
and
aunt
alice
was
at
home
recovering
from
a
luncheon
with
uncle
arthur
who
had
said
a
word
from
start
to
finish
and
though
she
did
like
most
of
his
words
when
he
did
say
them
she
liked
them
still
less
when
he
did
say
them
for
then
she
imagined
them
and
what
she
imagined
was
simply
awful
had
i
say
looked
at
aunt
alice
in
her
mind
eye
and
knew
that
this
too
was
true
mr
twist
reappeared
followed
by
the
brisk
steward
with
a
tray
of
tea
and
cake
and
their
corner
became
very
like
a
cheerful
picnic
mr
twist
was
most
pleasant
and
polite
had
told
him
quite
soon
after
he
began
to
talk
to
her
in
order
as
she
said
to
clear
his
mind
of
misconceptions
that
she
and
though
their
clothes
at
that
moment
and
the
pigtails
in
which
their
flair
was
done
might
be
misleading
were
no
longer
children
but
quite
the
contrary
that
they
were
in
fact
persons
who
were
almost
ripe
for
going
to
dances
and
certainly
in
another
year
would
be
perfectly
ripe
for
dances
supposing
there
were
any
mr
twist
listened
attentively
and
begged
her
to
tell
him
any
other
little
thing
she
might
think
of
as
useful
to
him
in
his
capacity
of
friend
and
attendant
both
of
which
said
mr
twist
he
intended
to
be
till
he
had
seen
them
safely
landed
in
new
york
i
hope
you
do
think
we
anybody
said
we
shall
like
being
friends
with
you
very
much
but
only
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
sure
said
mr
twist
who
was
an
american
i
thought
she
hesitated
a
moment
you
thought
encouraged
mr
twist
politely
i
thought
at
liverpool
you
looked
as
if
you
were
being
sorry
for
us
sorry
said
mr
twist
in
the
tone
of
one
who
repudiates
yes
when
we
were
waving
to
to
our
friends
sorry
repeated
mr
twist
which
was
great
waste
of
your
time
i
should
think
so
said
mr
twist
with
heartiness
having
cleared
the
ground
of
misunderstandings
an
activity
in
which
at
all
times
she
took
pleasure
accepted
mr
twist
attentions
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
were
offered
which
was
as
he
said
one
of
mutual
friendliness
and
esteem
as
he
was
never
he
could
move
about
and
do
things
for
them
that
might
be
difficult
to
do
for
themselves
as
he
knew
a
great
deal
about
stewardesses
he
could
tell
them
what
sort
of
tip
theirs
expected
as
he
was
american
he
could
illuminate
them
about
that
country
he
had
been
doing
red
cross
work
with
an
american
ambulance
in
france
for
ten
months
and
was
going
home
for
a
short
visit
to
see
how
his
mother
who
gathered
was
ancient
and
widowed
was
getting
on
his
mother
he
said
lived
in
seclusion
in
a
new
england
village
with
his
sister
who
had
not
married
then
she
got
it
all
before
her
said
like
us
said
i
should
think
she
got
as
much
of
it
before
her
as
you
said
mr
twist
because
she
considerably
more
grown
up
i
mean
he
added
hastily
as
mouth
opened
she
less
well
less
completely
young
we
not
completely
young
said
with
dignity
people
are
completely
young
the
day
they
born
and
ever
after
that
they
spend
their
time
becoming
less
so
exactly
and
my
sister
has
been
becoming
less
so
longer
than
you
have
i
assure
you
that
all
i
meant
she
less
so
even
than
i
am
then
said
glancing
at
that
part
of
mr
twist
head
where
it
appeared
to
be
coming
through
his
hair
she
must
have
got
to
the
stage
when
one
is
called
a
maiden
lady
and
if
she
were
a
german
said
suddenly
who
till
then
said
anything
to
mr
twist
but
only
smiled
widely
at
him
whenever
he
happened
to
look
her
way
she
would
be
either
a
lady
or
a
maiden
but
just
an
it
it
very
rude
of
germans
i
think
went
on
abstractedly
smiling
at
the
cake
mr
twist
was
offering
her
never
to
let
us
be
anything
but
its
till
we
taken
on
some
men
mr
twist
expressed
surprise
at
this
way
of
describing
marriage
and
inquired
of
what
she
knew
about
germans
the
moment
you
leave
off
being
said
turning
to
her
severely
you
start
being
indiscreet
well
i
suppose
she
added
with
a
sigh
to
mr
twist
you
have
had
to
know
sooner
or
later
our
name
is
twinkler
she
watched
him
to
see
the
effect
of
this
and
mr
twist
perceiving
he
was
expected
to
say
something
said
that
he
did
mind
that
anyhow
and
that
he
could
bear
something
worse
in
the
way
of
revelations
does
it
convey
nothing
to
you
asked
astonished
for
in
germany
the
name
of
twinkler
was
a
mighty
name
and
even
in
england
it
was
well
known
mr
twist
shook
his
head
only
that
it
sounds
cheerful
he
said
watched
his
face
it
is
only
twinkler
she
said
speaking
very
distinctly
it
twinkler
that
german
said
mr
twist
but
his
face
remained
serene
yes
and
so
are
we
that
is
we
would
be
if
it
did
happen
that
we
were
i
do
think
i
quite
follow
said
mr
twist
it
very
difficult
agreed
you
see
we
used
to
have
a
german
father
but
only
because
our
mother
married
him
explained
else
we
would
have
and
though
she
only
did
it
once
said
ages
ago
it
has
dogged
our
footsteps
ever
since
it
very
surprising
mused
what
marrying
anybody
does
you
go
into
a
church
and
before
you
know
where
you
are
all
tangled
up
with
posterity
and
much
worse
than
that
said
staring
at
her
own
past
experiences
posterity
all
tangled
up
with
you
it
really
simply
awful
sometimes
for
posterity
look
at
us
if
there
had
been
a
war
we
have
been
all
right
said
but
directly
there
a
war
whoever
it
is
married
if
it
is
one
of
your
own
countrymen
rises
up
against
you
just
as
if
he
were
too
many
meringues
you
had
for
dinner
living
or
dead
said
nodding
he
rises
up
against
you
till
the
war
we
never
thought
at
all
about
it
said
either
one
way
or
the
other
said
we
never
used
to
bother
about
what
we
were
said
we
were
just
human
beings
and
so
was
everybody
else
just
human
beings
we
did
mind
a
bit
about
being
germans
or
about
other
people
not
being
germans
but
you
must
think
we
mind
now
either
said
because
you
see
we
not
mr
twist
looked
at
them
in
turn
his
ears
were
a
little
prominent
and
pointed
and
they
gave
him
rather
the
air
when
he
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
them
of
an
attentive
i
do
think
i
quite
follow
he
said
again
it
very
difficult
agreed
it
because
you
got
into
your
head
that
we
german
because
of
our
father
said
but
what
a
father
when
all
said
and
done
well
said
mr
twist
one
has
to
have
him
but
having
got
him
he
is
anything
like
as
important
as
a
mother
said
one
hardly
sees
one
father
said
he
always
busy
he
always
thinking
of
something
else
except
when
he
looks
at
one
and
tells
one
to
sit
up
straight
said
pointedly
to
whose
habit
of
drooping
still
persisted
in
spite
of
her
father
admonishments
of
course
he
very
kind
and
benevolent
when
he
happens
to
remember
that
one
is
there
said
sitting
up
beautifully
for
a
moment
but
that
about
everything
and
of
course
said
one
father
intentions
are
perfectly
sound
and
good
but
his
attention
seems
to
wander
whereas
one
mother
yes
said
one
mother
they
broke
off
and
looked
straight
in
front
of
them
it
did
bear
speaking
of
it
did
bear
thinking
of
suddenly
weak
from
excessive
began
to
cry
the
tears
just
slopped
over
as
though
no
resistance
of
any
sort
were
possible
stared
at
her
a
moment
look
here
she
exclaimed
wrath
in
her
voice
i
wo
you
be
sentimental
i
wo
you
be
sentimental
and
then
she
too
began
to
cry
well
once
having
hopelessly
disgraced
and
exposed
themselves
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
mr
twist
into
their
uttermost
confidence
it
was
dreadful
it
was
awful
before
that
strange
man
a
person
they
hardly
knew
other
strangers
passing
exposing
their
feelings
showing
their
innermost
miserable
places
they
writhed
and
struggled
in
their
efforts
to
stop
to
pretend
they
were
crying
that
it
was
really
nothing
but
just
tears
odd
ones
left
over
from
last
time
which
was
years
and
years
ago
but
years
and
years
ago
sobbed
anxiously
explaining
the
years
one
falls
down
on
garden
paths
in
and
cuts
one
knees
and
one
mother
one
mother
one
see
here
said
mr
twist
interrupting
these
incoherences
and
pulling
out
a
beautiful
clean
which
had
even
been
unfolded
yet
you
got
to
tell
me
all
about
it
right
away
and
he
shook
out
the
handkerchief
and
with
the
promptness
his
red
cross
experience
had
taught
him
started
competently
wiping
up
their
faces
chapter
vii
there
was
that
about
mr
twist
which
once
one
had
begun
them
encouraged
confidences
something
kind
about
his
eyes
something
not
too
determined
about
his
chin
he
bore
no
resemblance
to
those
pictures
of
efficient
americans
in
advertisements
with
which
europe
is
familiar
gentlemen
with
intimidatingly
firm
mouths
and
chins
wiry
creatures
physically
and
mentally
perfect
offering
in
capital
letters
to
make
you
just
like
them
mr
twist
was
the
reverse
of
he
was
also
the
reverse
of
that
is
he
would
have
been
very
handsome
indeed
as
remarked
several
days
later
to
when
the
friendship
had
become
a
settled
thing
which
indeed
it
did
as
soon
as
mr
twist
had
finished
wiping
their
eyes
and
noses
that
first
afternoon
it
being
impossible
they
discovered
to
have
one
eyes
and
noses
wiped
by
somebody
without
being
friends
afterwards
for
such
an
activity
said
belonged
to
the
same
order
of
events
as
rescue
from
fire
lions
or
drowning
after
which
in
books
you
married
him
but
this
having
only
been
wiping
said
the
case
was
adequately
met
by
friendship
he
would
have
been
very
handsome
indeed
if
he
had
had
a
face
but
you
have
to
a
face
said
who
did
think
it
much
mattered
what
sort
it
was
so
long
as
you
could
eat
with
it
and
see
out
of
it
and
as
long
as
one
is
as
kind
as
mr
twist
said
but
secretly
she
thought
that
having
been
begun
so
successfully
at
his
feet
and
carried
upwards
with
such
grace
of
long
limbs
and
happy
proportions
he
might
as
well
have
gone
on
equally
felicitously
for
the
last
little
bit
i
expect
god
got
tired
of
him
over
that
last
bit
she
mused
and
just
put
on
any
sort
of
head
yes
that
happened
to
be
lying
about
agreed
in
a
hurry
to
get
done
with
him
anyway
he
very
kind
said
a
slight
touch
of
defiance
in
her
voice
oh
kind
agreed
and
it
does
matter
about
faces
for
being
kind
said
not
in
the
least
agreed
and
if
it
had
been
for
the
submarine
we
should
have
got
to
know
him
so
you
see
said
and
again
produced
her
favourite
remark
about
good
coming
out
of
evil
those
were
the
days
in
when
england
was
lost
in
its
own
peculiar
mists
and
the
sunshine
of
america
was
stretching
out
towards
them
the
sea
was
getting
calmer
and
bluer
every
hour
and
submarines
more
and
more
unlikely
if
a
ship
could
be
pleasant
which
doubted
for
she
still
found
difficulty
in
dressing
and
undressing
without
being
and
was
unpopular
in
the
cabin
this
ship
was
pleasant
you
lay
in
a
all
day
long
staring
at
the
blue
sky
and
blue
sea
that
enclosed
you
as
if
you
were
living
in
the
middle
of
a
jewel
and
tried
not
to
remember
oh
there
were
heaps
of
things
it
was
best
not
to
remember
and
when
the
rail
of
the
ship
moved
up
across
the
horizon
too
far
into
the
sky
or
moved
down
across
it
and
showed
too
much
water
you
just
shut
your
eyes
and
then
it
matter
and
the
sun
shone
warm
and
steady
on
your
face
and
the
wind
tickled
the
tassel
on
the
top
of
your
cap
and
mr
twist
came
and
read
aloud
to
you
which
sent
you
to
sleep
quicker
than
anything
you
had
ever
known
the
book
he
read
out
of
and
carried
about
with
him
his
pocket
was
called
masterpieces
you
must
master
and
was
an
american
collection
of
english
poetry
professing
in
its
preface
to
be
a
short
cut
to
culture
and
he
would
read
with
what
at
that
time
it
being
new
to
them
seemed
to
the
twins
a
strange
exotic
pronunciation
wordsworth
ode
to
dooty
and
the
effect
was
as
if
someone
should
dig
a
majestic
gregorian
psalm
in
its
ribs
and
make
it
leap
and
giggle
who
had
no
reason
to
shut
her
eyes
for
she
did
mind
what
the
ship
rail
did
with
the
horizon
opened
them
very
round
when
first
mr
twist
started
on
his
masterpieces
she
was
used
to
hearing
them
read
by
her
mother
in
the
adorable
husky
voice
that
sent
such
thrills
through
one
but
she
listened
with
the
courtesy
and
final
gratitude
due
to
the
efforts
to
entertain
her
of
so
amiable
a
friend
and
only
the
roundness
of
her
eyes
showed
her
astonishment
at
this
waltzing
round
as
it
appeared
to
her
of
mr
twist
with
the
stern
daughter
of
the
voice
of
god
he
also
read
lycidas
to
her
that
same
lycidas
uncle
arthur
took
for
a
derby
winner
and
only
politeness
enabled
her
to
refrain
from
stopping
up
her
ears
as
it
was
she
fidgeted
to
the
point
of
having
to
explain
on
mr
twist
pausing
to
gaze
at
her
questioningly
through
the
spectacles
he
wore
on
deck
which
made
him
look
so
like
a
gigantic
that
it
was
because
her
was
so
very
much
harder
than
she
was
who
considered
that
if
these
things
were
to
anywhere
seeing
she
knew
them
all
by
heart
she
must
have
long
ago
got
there
snoozed
complacently
sometimes
for
a
few
moments
she
would
drop
off
really
to
sleep
and
then
her
mouth
would
fall
open
which
worried
who
could
bear
her
to
look
even
for
a
moment
less
beautiful
than
she
knew
she
was
so
that
she
fidgeted
more
than
ever
unable
pinned
down
by
politeness
and
the
culture
being
administered
to
make
her
shut
her
mouth
and
look
beautiful
again
by
taking
and
shaking
her
also
had
a
trick
of
waking
up
suddenly
and
forgetting
to
be
polite
as
one
does
when
first
one
wakes
up
and
had
time
to
remember
one
is
a
lady
to
fresh
woods
and
pastures
noo
mr
twist
would
finish
for
instance
with
a
sort
of
gulp
of
satisfaction
at
having
swallowed
yet
another
solid
slab
of
culture
and
returning
suddenly
to
consciousness
would
murmur
with
her
eyes
still
shut
and
her
head
lolling
limply
things
like
after
all
it
rhyme
with
blue
i
wonder
why
then
one
still
does
like
it
then
mr
twist
would
turn
his
spectacles
towards
her
in
mild
inquiry
and
as
always
would
rush
in
and
elaborately
explain
what
meant
which
was
so
remote
from
anything
resembling
what
she
had
said
that
mr
twist
looked
more
mildly
inquiring
than
ever
usually
did
contradict
being
too
sleepy
or
too
lazy
but
sometimes
she
did
and
then
got
angry
and
would
get
what
the
germans
call
a
red
head
and
look
at
very
severely
and
say
things
and
mr
twist
would
close
his
book
and
watch
with
that
alert
look
of
a
sympathetic
and
highly
interested
terrier
but
sooner
or
later
the
ship
would
always
give
a
roll
and
would
shut
her
eyes
and
fade
to
paleness
and
become
the
helpless
bundle
of
sickness
that
nobody
could
possibly
go
on
being
severe
with
the
passengers
in
the
second
class
were
more
generally
friendly
than
those
in
the
first
class
the
first
class
sorted
itself
out
into
little
groups
and
whispered
about
each
other
as
observed
watching
their
movements
across
the
rope
that
separated
her
from
them
the
second
class
remained
to
the
end
one
big
group
frayed
out
just
a
little
at
the
edge
in
one
or
two
places
the
chief
fraying
out
was
where
the
twinkler
kids
as
the
young
men
who
knew
no
better
dared
to
call
them
interrupted
the
circle
by
talking
apart
with
mr
twist
mr
twist
had
no
business
there
he
was
a
plutocrat
of
the
first
class
but
in
spite
of
the
regulations
which
cut
off
the
classes
from
communicating
with
a
view
apparently
to
the
continued
sanitariness
of
the
first
class
the
implication
being
that
the
second
class
was
easily
infectious
and
probably
overrun
there
he
was
every
day
and
several
times
in
every
day
he
must
have
heavily
squared
the
officials
the
young
men
thought
until
the
day
when
mr
twist
let
it
somehow
be
understood
that
he
had
known
the
twinkler
young
ladies
for
years
dandled
them
in
their
not
very
remote
infancy
on
his
already
knee
and
had
been
specially
appointed
to
look
after
them
on
this
journey
mr
twist
did
not
specify
who
had
appointed
him
except
to
the
twinkler
young
ladies
themselves
and
to
them
he
announced
that
it
was
no
less
a
thing
being
or
creature
than
providence
the
young
men
therefore
in
spite
of
their
rising
spirits
as
danger
lay
further
behind
and
their
increasing
tendency
peculiar
to
those
who
go
on
ships
to
become
affectionate
found
themselves
no
further
on
in
acquaintance
with
the
misses
twinkler
the
last
day
of
the
voyage
than
they
had
been
the
first
not
that
under
any
other
conditions
they
would
have
so
much
as
noticed
the
existence
of
the
twinkler
kids
in
their
blue
caps
pulled
down
tight
to
their
eyebrows
and
hiding
every
trace
of
hair
they
looked
like
bald
babies
they
never
came
to
meals
their
assiduous
guardian
or
whatever
he
was
feeding
them
on
deck
with
the
care
of
a
for
its
fledglings
so
that
nobody
except
the
two
german
ladies
in
their
cabin
had
seen
them
without
the
caps
the
young
men
put
them
down
as
only
somewhere
about
fourteen
they
thought
and
nothing
but
what
if
they
were
boys
instead
of
girls
would
have
been
called
louts
still
a
ship
is
a
ship
and
it
is
wonderful
what
can
be
managed
in
the
way
of
dalliance
if
one
is
shut
up
on
one
long
enough
and
the
misses
twinkler
in
spite
of
their
loutishness
their
apparent
baldness
and
their
constant
solemnity
would
no
doubt
have
been
the
objects
of
advances
before
new
york
was
reached
if
it
had
been
for
mr
twist
there
was
a
girl
under
forty
in
the
second
class
on
that
voyage
the
young
men
resentfully
pointed
out
to
each
other
except
these
two
kids
who
were
too
much
under
it
and
a
young
lady
of
thirty
who
sat
manicuring
her
nails
most
of
the
day
with
her
back
supported
by
a
and
polishing
them
with
red
stuff
till
they
flashed
rosily
in
the
sun
this
young
lady
was
avoided
for
the
first
two
days
while
the
young
men
still
remembered
their
mothers
because
of
what
she
looked
like
but
was
greatly
loved
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
precisely
for
that
reason
still
every
one
could
get
near
her
she
was
only
one
and
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
active
young
men
taking
lithe
imprisoned
exercise
in
long
swift
steps
up
and
down
the
deck
ready
for
any
sort
of
enterprise
bursting
with
energy
and
and
spirits
so
that
at
last
the
those
of
the
young
men
the
lady
of
the
rosy
nails
was
less
kind
to
actually
in
their
despair
attempted
ghastly
flirtations
with
the
two
german
ladies
they
approached
them
with
a
kind
of
angry
amorousness
they
tucked
them
up
roughly
in
rugs
they
brought
them
cushions
as
though
they
were
curses
and
it
was
through
this
in
the
icy
warmth
of
which
the
german
ladies
expanded
like
bulky
flowers
and
grew
at
least
ten
years
younger
the
ten
years
they
shed
being
their
most
respectable
ones
that
the
ship
became
aware
of
the
nationality
of
the
misses
twinkler
the
german
ladies
were
not
really
german
as
they
explained
directly
there
were
no
more
submarines
about
for
a
good
woman
they
said
becomes
automatically
merged
into
her
husband
and
they
therefore
were
merged
into
americans
both
of
them
and
as
loyal
as
you
could
find
but
the
twinklers
were
the
real
thing
they
said
real
unadulterated
arrogant
junkers
which
is
why
they
would
talk
to
anybody
for
no
junker
said
the
german
ladies
thinks
anybody
good
enough
to
be
talked
to
except
another
junker
the
german
ladies
themselves
had
by
sheer
luck
not
been
born
junkers
they
had
missed
it
very
narrowly
but
they
had
missed
it
for
which
they
were
very
thankful
seeing
what
believers
they
were
under
the
affectionate
manipulation
of
their
husbands
in
democracy
but
they
came
from
the
part
of
germany
where
junkers
most
abound
and
knew
the
sort
of
thing
well
it
seemed
to
mr
twist
who
caught
scraps
of
conversation
as
he
came
and
went
that
in
the
cabin
the
twinklers
must
have
alienated
sympathy
they
had
they
had
done
more
they
had
got
themselves
actively
disliked
from
the
first
moment
when
had
dared
to
peep
into
their
shrouded
bunks
the
ladies
had
been
prejudiced
and
this
prejudice
had
later
flared
up
into
a
great
and
justified
dislike
the
ladies
to
begin
with
had
known
that
they
were
von
twinklers
but
had
supposed
them
mere
twinklers
and
the
von
as
every
german
knows
makes
all
the
difference
especially
in
the
case
of
twinklers
who
without
it
were
a
race
the
ladies
knew
of
small
shopkeepers
laundresses
and
postmen
in
the
westphalian
district
but
with
it
were
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
prussia
known
to
all
germans
possessed
of
a
name
ensuring
subservience
wherever
it
went
in
this
stage
of
preliminary
ignorance
the
ladies
had
treated
the
two
apparently
ordinary
twinklers
with
the
severity
their
conduct
age
and
obvious
want
of
means
deserved
and
when
goaded
by
their
questionings
the
smaller
and
more
active
twinkler
had
let
out
her
von
at
them
much
as
one
lets
loose
a
dog
when
one
is
alone
and
weak
against
the
attacks
of
an
enemy
instead
of
falling
in
harmoniously
with
the
natural
change
of
attitude
of
the
ladies
which
became
immediately
perfectly
polite
and
conciliatory
as
well
as
motherly
in
its
interest
and
curiosity
the
two
young
junkers
went
dumb
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
most
motherly
questioning
and
just
in
proportion
as
the
german
ladies
found
themselves
full
of
eager
milk
of
kindness
only
asking
to
be
permitted
to
nourish
so
did
they
find
themselves
subsequently
after
a
day
or
two
of
such
uncloaked
repugnance
to
it
left
with
quantities
of
it
useless
on
their
hands
and
all
going
sour
from
first
to
last
the
twinklers
annoyed
them
as
plain
twinklers
they
had
been
tiresome
in
a
hundred
ways
in
the
cabin
and
as
von
twinklers
they
were
intolerable
in
their
indifference
it
had
naturally
been
expected
by
the
elder
ladies
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
that
two
obscure
twinklers
of
such
manifest
youth
should
rise
politely
and
considerately
each
morning
very
early
and
get
themselves
dressed
and
out
of
the
way
in
at
the
most
ten
minutes
leaving
the
cabin
clear
for
the
slow
and
careful
putting
together
bit
by
bit
of
that
which
ultimately
emerged
a
perfect
specimen
of
a
lady
of
riper
years
but
the
weedy
twinkler
insisted
on
lying
in
her
berth
so
late
that
if
the
ladies
wished
to
be
in
time
for
the
best
parts
of
breakfast
which
they
naturally
and
passionately
did
wish
they
were
forced
to
dress
in
her
presence
which
was
most
annoying
and
awkward
it
is
true
she
lay
with
closed
eyes
apparently
apathetic
but
you
never
know
with
persons
of
that
age
experience
teaches
not
to
trust
them
they
shut
their
eyes
and
yet
seem
later
on
to
have
seen
they
apparently
sleep
and
afterwards
are
heard
asking
their
spectacled
american
friend
what
people
do
on
a
ship
a
place
of
so
much
gustiness
if
their
hair
gets
blown
off
into
the
sea
also
the
weedy
one
had
a
most
tiresome
trick
of
being
sick
instantly
every
time
odol
was
used
or
a
little
brandy
was
drunk
odol
is
most
refreshing
it
has
a
lovely
smell
without
which
no
german
bedroom
is
complete
and
the
brandy
was
not
common
schnaps
but
an
old
expensive
brandy
that
regarded
as
a
smell
was
a
credit
to
anybody
cabin
the
german
ladies
would
have
persisted
and
indeed
did
persist
in
using
odol
and
drinking
a
little
brandy
indifferent
to
the
feeble
prayer
from
the
upper
berth
which
floated
down
entreating
them
not
to
but
in
their
own
interests
they
were
forced
to
give
it
up
the
objectionable
child
did
not
pray
a
second
time
she
passed
immediately
from
prayer
to
performance
of
two
disagreeables
wise
women
choose
the
lesser
but
they
remain
resentful
the
other
twinkler
the
small
active
one
did
get
up
early
and
take
herself
off
but
she
frequently
mixed
up
her
own
articles
of
toilet
with
those
belonging
to
the
ladies
and
would
pin
up
her
hair
preparatory
to
washing
her
face
with
their
hairpins
when
they
discovered
this
they
hid
them
and
she
not
finding
any
having
come
to
the
end
of
her
own
lost
no
time
in
irresolution
but
picked
up
their
and
pinned
up
her
pigtails
with
that
it
was
a
particularly
sacred
pair
of
that
almost
everything
blunted
to
use
them
for
anything
but
nails
was
an
outrage
but
the
grossest
outrage
was
to
touch
them
at
all
when
they
told
her
sharply
that
the
scissors
were
very
delicate
and
she
was
instantly
to
take
them
out
of
her
hair
she
tugged
them
out
in
a
silence
that
was
itself
impertinent
and
pinned
up
her
pigtails
with
their
buttonhook
instead
then
they
raised
themselves
on
their
elbows
in
their
berths
and
asked
her
what
sort
of
a
bringing
up
she
could
have
had
and
they
raised
their
voices
as
well
for
though
they
were
grateful
as
they
later
on
declared
for
not
having
been
born
junkers
they
had
nevertheless
acquired
by
practice
in
imitation
some
of
the
more
salient
junker
characteristics
you
are
said
the
upper
berth
lady
which
is
untranslatable
not
on
grounds
of
propriety
but
of
idiom
it
is
not
however
a
term
of
praise
yes
that
is
what
you
are
echoed
the
lower
berth
lady
and
your
sister
is
too
lying
in
bed
till
all
hours
it
is
shameful
for
girls
to
be
said
the
upper
berth
i
did
know
it
was
your
buttonhook
i
thought
it
was
ours
said
pulling
this
out
too
with
vehemence
that
is
because
you
are
said
the
lower
berth
and
i
did
know
it
was
our
scissors
either
said
the
lower
berth
beating
her
hand
on
the
wooden
edge
of
her
bunk
and
and
i
sorry
face
was
very
red
she
did
look
sorry
she
looked
angry
and
so
she
was
but
it
was
with
herself
for
having
failed
in
discernment
and
she
ought
to
have
noticed
that
the
scissors
and
buttonhook
were
not
hers
she
had
pounced
on
them
with
the
haste
of
twelve
years
old
she
had
been
a
lady
she
whose
business
it
was
to
be
an
example
and
mainstay
to
in
all
things
going
first
showing
her
the
way
she
picked
up
the
sponge
and
plunged
it
into
the
water
and
was
just
going
to
plunge
her
annoyed
and
heated
face
in
after
it
when
the
upper
berth
lady
said
your
mother
should
be
ashamed
of
herself
to
have
brought
you
up
so
badly
and
send
you
off
like
this
before
she
has
taught
you
even
the
abc
of
manners
said
the
lower
berth
evidently
said
the
upper
berth
she
can
have
none
herself
evidently
said
the
lower
berth
she
is
herself
the
sponge
dripping
with
water
came
quickly
out
of
the
basin
in
clenched
fist
for
one
awful
instant
she
stood
there
in
her
nightgown
like
some
bird
of
judgment
poised
for
dreadful
flight
her
eyes
flaming
her
knotted
pigtails
bristling
on
the
top
of
her
head
the
wet
sponge
twitched
in
her
hand
the
ladies
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
that
twitching
and
continued
to
offer
large
angry
faces
as
a
target
one
of
the
faces
would
certainly
have
received
the
sponge
and
have
been
disgraced
for
ever
if
it
had
been
for
the
prompt
and
skilful
intervention
of
for
roused
from
her
morning
languor
by
the
unusual
loudness
of
the
german
ladies
voices
and
smitten
into
attention
and
opening
of
her
eyes
heard
the
awful
things
they
were
saying
and
saw
the
sponge
instantly
she
knew
seeing
it
was
who
held
it
where
it
would
be
in
another
second
and
hastily
putting
out
a
shaking
little
hand
from
her
top
berth
caught
hold
feebly
but
obstinately
of
the
upright
ends
of
knotted
pigtails
i
going
to
be
sick
she
announced
with
great
presence
of
mind
and
entire
absence
of
candour
she
knew
however
that
she
only
had
to
sit
up
in
order
to
be
sick
and
the
excellent
child
gute
as
her
father
used
to
call
her
because
she
so
conveniently
from
the
parental
point
of
view
invariably
never
wanted
to
be
or
do
anything
particularly
without
hesitation
sacrificed
herself
in
order
to
save
her
sister
honour
and
sat
up
and
immediately
was
by
the
time
had
done
attending
to
her
all
fury
had
died
out
she
never
could
see
anna
felicitas
lying
back
pale
and
exhausted
after
one
of
these
attacks
without
forgiving
her
and
everybody
else
everything
she
climbed
up
on
the
wooden
steps
to
smoothe
her
pillow
and
tuck
her
blanket
round
her
and
when
her
eyes
shut
murmured
christopher
do
mind
and
she
suddenly
realized
for
they
never
called
each
other
by
those
names
except
in
great
moments
of
emotion
when
it
was
necessary
to
cheer
and
encourage
what
had
saved
her
from
and
that
it
had
been
done
deliberately
she
could
only
whisper
back
because
she
was
so
afraid
of
crying
no
no
columbus
dear
of
course
who
really
cares
about
and
came
down
off
the
steps
with
no
fight
left
in
her
also
the
wrath
of
the
ladies
was
considerably
assuaged
they
had
retreated
behind
their
curtains
until
the
so
terribly
unsettled
twinkler
should
be
quiet
again
and
when
once
more
they
drew
them
a
crack
apart
in
order
to
keep
an
eye
on
what
the
other
one
might
be
going
to
do
next
and
saw
her
doing
nothing
except
with
meekness
getting
dressed
they
merely
inquired
what
part
of
westphalia
she
came
from
and
only
in
the
tone
they
asked
it
did
they
convey
that
whatever
part
it
was
it
was
anyhow
a
contemptible
one
we
do
come
from
westphalia
said
bristling
a
little
in
spite
of
herself
at
their
persistent
baiting
listened
in
cold
anxiousness
she
did
want
to
have
to
be
sick
again
she
doubted
whether
she
could
bear
it
you
must
come
from
somewhere
said
the
lower
berth
and
being
a
twinkler
it
must
be
westphalia
we
do
really
said
mindful
of
words
and
making
a
great
effort
to
speak
politely
we
come
from
england
england
cried
the
lower
berth
annoyed
by
this
quibbling
you
were
born
in
westphalia
all
twinklers
are
born
in
westphalia
invariably
they
are
said
the
upper
berth
the
only
circumstance
that
stops
them
is
if
their
mothers
happen
to
be
temporarily
absent
but
we
were
really
said
continuing
her
efforts
to
remain
bland
are
you
pretending

beating
her

on
the

of
her

that
you
are

our
father
was

said
driven
into
a
corner
but
i
do
suppose
he
is
now
i
should
think
he
want
to
go
on
being

directly
he
got
to
a
really
neutral
place
has
he
fled
his
country
inquired
the
lower
berth
sternly
scenting
what
she
had
from
the
first
suspected
something
sinister
in
the
twinkler
background
i
suppose
one
might
call
it
that
said
after
a
pause
of
consideration
tying
her
do
you
mean
to
say
said
the
ladies
with
one
voice
feeling
themselves
now
on
the
very
edge
of
a
scandal
he
was
forced
to
fly
from
westphalia
i
suppose
one
might
put
it
that
way
said
again
considering
she
took
her
cap
off
its
hook
and
adjusted
it
over
her
hair
with
a
deliberation
intended
to
assure
that
she
was
remaining
calm
except
that
it
was
from
westphalia
he
flew
but
prussia
she
said
prussia
cried
the
ladies
as
one
woman
again
rising
themselves
on
their
elbows
that
where
our
father
lived
said
staring
at
them
in
her
surprise
at
their
surprise
so
of
course
as
he
lived
there
when
he
died
he
did
that
there
too
prussia
cried
the
ladies
again
he
died
you
said
your
father
fled
his
country
no
said
that
said
she
gave
her
cap
a
final
tug
down
over
her
ears
and
turned
to
the
door
she
felt
as
if
she
quite
soon
again
in
spite
of
might
not
be
able
to
be
a
lady
after
all
it
what
you
do
when
you
go
to
heaven
she
said
as
she
opened
the
door
unable
to
resist
according
to
her
custom
having
the
last
word
but
prussia
they
still
cried
still
her
as
it
were
from
afar
then
you

mr
twist
who
was
never
able
to
be
anything
but
kind
he
had
the
most
amiable
mouth
and
chin
in
the
world
and
his
name
was
edward
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
plans
and
probable
future
of
the
two
annas
he
also
took
a
lively
and
solicitous
interest
in
their
present
and
a
profoundly
sympathetic
one
in
their
past
in
fact
their
three
tenses
interested
him
to
the
exclusion
of
almost
everything
else
and
his
chief
desire
was
to
see
them
safely
through
any
shoals
there
might
be
waiting
them
in
the
shape
of
uncle
arthur
friends
he
distrusted
uncle
arthur
and
therefore
his
friends
into
the
safe
and
pleasant
waters
of
real
american
hospitality
and
kindliness
he
knew
that
such
waters
abounded
for
those
who
could
find
the
tap
he
reminded
himself
of
that
which
he
had
been
taught
since
childhood
of
the
mighty
heart
of
america
which
once
touched
would
take
persons
like
the
twins
right
in
and
never
let
them
out
again
but
it
had
to
be
touched
it
had
as
it

with

defenceless

they
had
been
belgians
now
or
serbians
or
any
persons
plainly
in
need
of
relief
as
it
was
america
would
be
likely
he
feared
to
consider
that
either
germany
or
england
ought
to
be
looking
after
them
and
might
conceivably
remain
chilly
and
uninterested
uncle
arthur
it
appeared
had
many
friends
in
america
and
those
he
had
did
like
him
at
least
that
was
what
mr
twist
gathered
from
the
conversation
of
she
did
positively
assert
but
she
very
candidly
conjectured
and
mr
twist
could
quite
believe
that
uncle
arthur
friends
would
be
warm
ones
their
hospitality
he
could
imagine
fleeting
and
perfunctory
they
would
pass
on
the
twinklers
as
soon
as
possible
as
indeed
why
should
they
not
and
presently
some
dreary
small
job
would
be
found
for
them
some
job
as
or
girls
companion
in
the
sterile
atmosphere
of
a
young
ladies
school
as
much
as
a
man
of
habitually
generous
impulses
could
dislike
mr

disliked
uncle
arthur
patriotism
was
nothing
at
any
time
to
mr
twist
compared
to
humanity
and
uncle
arthur
particular
kind
of
patriotism
was
very
odious
to
him
to
wreak
it
on
these
two
poor
aliens
mr
twist
had
no
words
for
it
they
had
been
cut
adrift
at
a
tender
age
an
age
mr
twist
as
a
disciplined
american
son
and
brother
was
unable
to
regard
unmoved
and
packed
off
over
the
sea
indifferent
to
what
might
happen
to
them
so
long
as
uncle
arthur
knew
nothing
about
it

these
kittens
into

so
long
as

of
which
there
was
a
great
deal
rose
up
within
him
at
the
thought
of
uncle
arthur
he
wanted
to
go
and
ask
him
what
he
meant
by
such
conduct
and
earnestly
inquire
of
him
whether
he
called
himself
a
man
but
as
he
knew
he
could
do
this
being
on
a
ship
heading
for
new
york
he
made
up
for
it
by
taking
as
much
care
of
the
ejected
nieces
as
if
he
were
an
uncle
himself
but
the
right
sort
of
uncle
the
sort
you
have
in
america
the
sort
that
regards
you
as
a
sacred
and
precious
charge
in
his
mind
eye
mr
twist
saw
uncle
arthur
as
a
typical
bullying
briton
with
short
he
pictured
him
and
trudging
home
from
golf
through
the
soppy
green
fields
of
england
to
his
trembling
household
he
was
quite
disconcerted
one
day
to
discover
from
something
said
that
he
was
a
tall
man
and
not
fat
at
all
except
in
one
place
indeed
said
mr
twist
hastily
rearranging
his
view
of
uncle
arthur
he
goes
fat
suddenly
said
waking
from
one
of
her
dozes
as
though
he
had
swallowed
a
bomb
and
it
had
stuck
when
it
got
to
his
waistcoat
if
you
can
imagine
it
added
politely
ready
to
explain
and
describe
further
if
required
but
mr
twist
could
imagine
it
he
readjusted
his
picture
of
uncle
arthur
and
this
time
got
him
right
the
tall
not
man
and
with
more
hair
a
great
deal
than
he
mr
twist
had
he
had
thought
of
him
as
an
old
ruffian
he
now
perceived
that
he
could
be
hardly
more
than
and
that
aunt
alice
a
lady
for
whom
he
felt
an
almost
painful
sympathy
had
a
lot
more
of
uncle
arthur
to
get
through
before
she
was
done
yes
said
accepting
the
word
as
correct
neither
of
his
ends
looks
much
older
than
yours
do
he
aged
in
the
middle
that
the
only
place
where
the
bomb
is
i
suppose
that
why
it
called
said
dreamily
one
first
and
from
there
it
just
spreads
it
must
be
queer
she
added
pensively
to
watch
oneself
gradually
rotting
these
were
the
sorts
of
observations
mr
twist
felt
that
might
prejudice
his
mother
against
the
twins
if
they
could
be
induced
not
to
say
most
of
the
things
they
did
say
when
in
her
presence
he
felt
that
his
house
of
all
houses
in
america
should
be
offered
them
as
a
refuge
whenever
they
were
in
need
of
one
but
his
mother
was
not
he
feared
very
adaptable
in
her
house
it
was
legally
his
but
it
never
felt
as
if
it
were
people
adapted
themselves
to
her
he
doubted
whether
the
twins
could
or
would
their
leading
characteristic
he
had
observed
was
candour
they
had
no
they
seemed
incapable
of
anything
but
naturalness
and
their
particular
type
of
naturalness
was
not
one
he
was
afraid
that
his
mother
would
understand
she
had
not
been
out
of
her
new
england
village
a
place
called
briefly
with
american
economy
of
time
clark
for
many
years
and
her
ideal
of
youthful
femininity
was
still
that
which
she
had
been
herself
she
had
if
unconsciously
tried
to
mould
mr
twist
also
on
these
lines
in
spite
of
his
being
a
boy
and
owing
to
his
extreme
considerateness
had
not
yet
discovered
her
want
of
success
for
years
indeed
she
had
been
completely
successful
and
mr
twist
arrived
at
and
embarked
on
adolescence
with
the
manners
and
ways
of
thinking
of
a
perfect
lady
till
he
was
nineteen
he
was
educated
at
home
as
it
were
at
his
knee
at
any
rate
within
reach
of
that
sacred
limb
and
she
had
taught
him
to
reverence
women
the
reason
given
or
rather
conveyed
being
that
he
had
had
and
still
was
having
a
mother
which
he
was
never
to
forget
in
hours
of
temptation
in
hours
of
danger
mr
twist
with
his
virginal
white
mind
used
to
wonder
when
the
hours
of
temptation
and
of
danger
would
begin
and
rather
wish
in
the
elegant
leisure
of
his
that
they
soon
would
so
that
he
might
show
how
determined
he
was
to
avoid
them
for
the
ten
years
from
his
father
death
till
he
went
to
harvard
he
lived
with
his
mother
and
sister
and
was
their
assiduous
attendant
his
mother
took
the
loss
of
his
father
badly
she
did
get
over
it
as
widows
sometimes
do
and
grow
suddenly
ten
years
younger
the
sight
of
her
so
black
and
broken
of
so
daily
recurring
a
patience
of
such
frequent
deliberate
brightening
for
the
sake
of
her
children
kept
mr
twist
as
he
grew
up
from
those
thoughts
which
sometimes
occur
to
young
men
and
have
to
do
with
curves
and
dimples
he
was
too
much
absorbed
by
his
mother
to
think
on
such
lines
he
was
flooded
with
reverence
and
pity
through
her
all
women
were
holy
to
him
they
were
all
mothers
either
actual
or
to
be
after
of
course
the
proper
ceremonies
they
were
all
people
for
whom
one
leapt
up
and
opened
doors
placed
chairs
out
of
draughts
and
fetched
black
shawls
on
warm
spring
days
when
he
was
about
eighteen
he
told
himself
earnestly
that
it
would
be
a
profanity
a
terrible
secret
sinning
to
think
amorously
yes
he
supposed
the
word
was
amorously
while
there
under
his
eyes
pervading
his
days
from
breakfast
to
bedtime
was
that
mourning
womanhood
that
lopped
life
that
example
of
brave
doing
without
any
hope
or
expectation
except
what
might
be
expected
or
hoped
from
heaven
his
mother
was
wonderful
the
way
she
bore
things
there
she
was
with
nothing
left
to
look
forward
to
in
the
way
of
pleasures
except
the
resurrection
yet
she
did
not
complain
but
after
he
had
been
at
harvard
a
year
a
change
came
over
mr
twist
not
that
he
did
not
remain
dutiful
and
affectionate
but
he
perceived
that
it
was
possible
to
peep
round
the
corners
of
his
mother
the
corners
that
had
so
long
jutted
out
between
him
and
the
view
and
on
the
other
side
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
lot
of
interesting
things
going
on
he
continued
however
only
to
eye
most
of
them
from
afar
and
the
nearest
he
got
to
temptation
while
at
harvard
was
to
read
madame
bovary
after
harvard
he
was
put
into
an
engineering
firm
for
the
twists
only
had
what
would
in
english
money
be
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
belonged
therefore
taking
dollars
as
the
measure
of
standing
instead
of
birth
to
the
middle
classes
aunt
alice
would
have
described
such
an
income
as
ample
means
mrs
twist
called
it
straitened
circumstances
and
lived
accordingly
in
a
condition
of
perpetual
and
doings
without
she
had
a
car
but
it
was
only
a
car
not
a
and
there
was
a
bathroom
to
every
bedroom
but
there
were
only
six
bedrooms
and
the
house
stood
on
a
hill
and
looked
over
the
most
beautiful
woods
but
they
were
somebody
else
woods
she
felt
as
she
beheld
the
lives
of
those
of
her
neighbours
she
let
her
eyes
rest
on
who
were
the
millionaires
dotted
round
about
the
charming
environs
of
clark
that
she
was
indeed
a
typical
widow
remote
unfriended
melancholy
poor
mrs
twist
might
feel
poor
but
she
was
certainly
comfortable
it
was
her
daughter
edith
aim
in
life
to
secure
for
her
the
comfort
and
leisure
necessary
for
any
grief
that
wishes
to
be
thorough
the
house
was
run
beautifully
by
edith
there
were
three
servants
of
whom
edith
was
one
she
was
the
lady
maid
the
head
cook
and
the
family
butler
and
mr
twist
till
he
went
to
harvard
might
be
described
as
the
and
afterwards
in
his
vacations
as
the
odd
man
about
the
house
everything
centred
round
their
mother
she
made
a
good
deal
of
work
because
of
being
so
anxious
not
to
give
trouble
she
would
get
out
of
the
way
of
evil
but
bleakly
accepted
it
she
would
get
out
of
a
draught
but
sat
in
it
till
one
or
other
of
her
children
remembered
they
had
shut
the
door
when
the
inevitable
cold
was
upon
her
and
she
was
lamentably
coughing
she
would
mention
the
door
for
the
first
time
and
quietly
say
she
had
liked
to
trouble
them
to
shut
it
they
had
seemed
so
busy
with
their
own
affairs
but
after
he
had
been
in
the
engineering
firm
a
little
while
a
further
change
came
over
mr
twist
he
was
there
to
make
money
more
money
for
his
mother
the
first
duty
of
an
american
male
had
descended
on
him
he
wished
earnestly
to
fulfil
it
creditably
in
spite
of
his
own
tastes
being
so
simple
that
his
income
of
it
was
his
not
his
mother
but
it
did
feel
as
if
it
were
would
have
been
more
than
sufficient
for
him
out
of
engineering
then
was
he
to
wrest
all
the
things
that
might
comfort
his
mother
he
embarked
on
his
career
with
as
determined
an
expression
on
his
mouth
as
so
soft
and
friendly
a
mouth
could
be
made
to
take
and
he
had
been
in
it
long
before
he
passed
out
altogether
beyond
the
line
of
thinking
his
mother
had
laid
down
for
him
and
definitely
grew
up
the
office
was
in
new
york
far
enough
away
from
clark
for
him
to
be
at
home
only
for
the
sundays
his
mother
put
him
to
board
with
her
brother
charles
a
clergyman
the
rector
of
the
church
of
angelic
refreshment
at
the
back
of
tenth
street
and
the
teapot
out
of
which
uncle
charles
poured
his
tea
at
his
hurried
and
uncomfortable
meals
for
he
practised
the
austerities
and
had
no
wife
dribbled
at
its
spout
hold
it
as
carefully
as
one
might
it
dribbled
at
its
spout
and
added
to
the
confused
appearance
of
the
table
by
staining
the
cloth
afresh
every
time
it
was
used
mr
twist
who
below
the
nose
was
nothing
but
kindliness
and
generosity
his
slightly
weak
chin
his
mouth
being
all
amiability
and
affection
above
the
nose
was
quite
different
in
the
middle
came
his
nose
a
nose
that
led
him
to
improve
himself
to
read
and
meditate
the
poets
to
be
tenacious
in
following
after
the
noble
and
above
were
eyes
in
which
simplicity
sat
side
by
side
with
appreciation
and
above
these
was
the
forehead
like
a
dome
and
behind
this
forehead
were
inventions
he
had
not
been
definitely
aware
that
he
was
inventive
till
he
came
into
daily
contact
with
uncle
charles
teapot
in
his
boyhood
he
had
often
fixed
up
little
things
for
edith
she
was
three
years
older
than
he
and
was
even
then
canning
and
preserving
and
ironing
little
simplifications
and
alleviations
of
her
labour
but
they
had
been
just
toys
things
that
had
amused
him
to
put
together
and
that
he
forgot
as
soon
as
they
were
done
but
the
teapot
revealed
to
him
clearly
what
his
forehead
was
there
for
he
would
not
and
could
not
continue
being
the
soul
of
considerateness
to
spill
tea
on
uncle
charles
at
every
meal
they
had
tea
at
breakfast
and
at
luncheon
and
at
supper
and
if
he
were
thirsty
he
spilled
it
several
times
at
every
meal
for
a
long
time
he
coaxed
the
teapot
he
was
thoughtful
with
it
he
handled
it
with
the
most
delicate
precision
he
gave
it
time
he
never
hurried
it
he
never
filled
it
more
than
half
full
and
yet
at
the
end
of
every
pouring
out
came
the
same
devastating
dribble
on
to
the
cloth
then
he
went
out
and
bought
another
teapot
one
of
a
different
pattern
with
a
curved
spout
instead
of
a
straight
one
the
same
thing
happened
then
he
went
to
wanamaker
and
spent
an
hour
in
the
teapot
section
trying
one
pattern
after
the
other
patiently
pouring
water
provided
by
a
tipped
but
languid
and
supercilious
assistant
out
of
each
different
make
of
teapot
into
cups
they
all
dribbled
then
mr
twist
went
home
and
sat
down
and
thought
he
thought
and
thought
with
his
forehead
resting
on
his
long
thin
hand
and
what
came
out
of
his
forehead
at
last
sprang
out
of
it
as
complete
in
every
detail
as
pallas
athene
when
she
very
similarly
sprang
was
that
now
object
on
every
breakfast
table
twist
teapot
in
five
years
mr
twist
made
a
fortune
out
of
the
teapot
his
mother
passed
from
her
straitened
circumstances
to
what
she
still
would
only
call
a
modest
competence
but
what
in
england
would
have
been
regarded
as
wallowing
in
money
she
left
off
being
and
was
received
into
the
lower
the
upper
part
of
this
being
reserved
for
great
names
like
astor
rockefeller
and
vanderbilt
with
these
mrs
twist
could
not
compete
she
would
no
doubt
some
day
for
edward
was
only
thirty
and
there
were
still
but
what
he
was
able
to
add
to
the
family
income
helped
her
for
a
time
to
bear
the
loss
of
the
elder
twist
with
less
of
bleakness
in
her
resignation
it
was
as
though
an
east
wind
veered
round
for
a
brief
space
a
little
to
the
south
being
naturally
however
inclined
to
deprecation
when
every
other
reason
for
it
was
finally
removed
by
her
assiduous
son
she
once
more
sought
out
and
firmly
laid
hold
of
the
departed
twist
and
hung
her
cherished
unhappiness
up
on
him
again
as
if
he
were
a
peg
when
the
novelty
of
having
a
great
many
bedrooms
instead
of
six
and
a
great
deal
of
food
not
to
eat
but
to
throw
away
and
ten
times
of
everything
else
instead
of
only
once
began
to
wear
off
mrs
twist
drooped
again
and
pulled
the
departed
twist
out
of
the
decent
forgetfulness
of
the
past
and
he
once
more
came
to
dinner
in
the
form
of
his
favourite
dishes
and
assisted
in
the
family
conversations
by
means
of
copious
quotations
from
his
alleged
utterances
mr
twist
income
was
anything
between
sixty
and
seventy
thousand
pounds
a
year
by
the
time
the
war
broke
out
having
invented
and
patented
the
simple
device
that
kept
the
of
america
and
indeed
of
europe
spotless
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
receive
his
percentages
sit
still
in
fact
and
grow
richer
but
so
much
had
he
changed
since
his
adolescence
that
he
preferred
to
stick
to
his
engineering
and
his
office
in
new
york
rather
than
go
home
and
be
happy
with
his
mother
she
could
not
understand
this
behaviour
in
edward
she
understood
his
behaviour
still
less
when
he
went
off
to
france
in
himself
equipping
and
giving
the
ambulance
he
drove
for
a
year
his
absence
and
the
dangers
he
was
running
divided
mrs
twist
sorrows
into
halves
her
position
as
a
widow
with
an
only
son
in
danger
touched
the
imagination
of
clark
and
she
was
never
so
much
called
upon
as
during
this
year
now
edward
was
coming
home
for
a
rest
and
there
was
a
subdued
flutter
about
her
rather
like
the
stirring
of
the
funeral
plumes
on
the
heads
of
while
he
was
crossing
the
atlantic
and
the
twinklers
this
was
one
of
epigrams
and
she
tried
patience
severely
by
asking
her
not
once
but
several
times
whether
she
think
it
funny
whereas
disliked
it
from
the
first
because
of
the
suggestion
it
contained
that
mr
twist
regarded
what
he
did
for
them
as
works
of
mercy
while
mr
twist
was
engaged
in
these
activities
at
his
home
in
clark
all
the
things
edith
could
think
of
that
he
used
most
to
like
to
eat
were
being
got
ready
there
was
an
immense
slaughtering
of
chickens
and
baking
and
churning
edith
who
being
now
the
head
servant
of
many
instead
of
three
was
more
than
double
as
as
she
used
to
be
was
on
her
feet
those
last
few
days
without
stopping
and
she
had
to
go
and
meet
edward
in
new
york
as
well
whether
mrs
twist
feared
that
he
might
not
come
straight
home
or
whether
it
was
what
she
said
it
was
that
dear
edward
must
not
be
the
only
person
on
the
boat
who
had
no
one
to
meet
him
is
not
certain
what
is
certain
is
that
when
it
came
to
the
point
and
edith
had
to
start
mrs
twist
had
difficulty
in
maintaining
her
usual
brightness
edith
would
be
a
whole
day
away
and
perhaps
a
night
if
the
got
in
late
for
clark
is
five
hours
train
journey
from
new
york
and
during
all
that
time
mrs
twist
would
be
uncared
for
she
thought
edith
surprisingly
thoughtless
to
be
so
much
pleased
to
go
she
examined
her
flat
and
sinewy
form
with
disapproval
when
she
came
in
hatted
and
booted
to
say
no
wonder
nobody
married
edith
and
the
money
help
her
either
now
she
was
too
old
she
had
missed
her
chances
poor
thing
mrs
twist
forgot
the
young
man
there
had
been
once
years
before
when
edward
was
still
in
the
school
room
who
had
almost
married
edith
he
was
a
lusty
and
enterprising
young
man
who
had
come
to
clark
to
stay
with
a
neighbour
and
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
through
a
long
vacation
and
had
taken
to
dropping
in
at
all
hours
and
interrupting
edith
in
her
housekeeping
and
edith
even
then
completely
flat
but
of
a
healthy
young
uprightness
and
bright
of
eyes
and
hair
had
gone
silly
and
forgotten
how
to
cook
and
had
given
her
mother
who
surely
had
enough
sorrows
already
an
attack
of
indigestion
mrs
twist
however
had
headed
the
young
man
off
edith
was
too
necessary
to
her
at
that
time
she
could
not
possibly
lose
edith
and
besides
the
only
way
to
avoid
being
a
widow
is
not
to
marry
she
told
herself
that
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
poor
edith
running
the
risk
of
an
affliction
similar
to
her
own
if
one
has
a
husband
one
can
not
lose
him
mrs
twist
clearly
saw
if
edith
married
she
would
certainly
lose
him
unless
he
lost
her
marriage
had
only
two
solutions
she
explained
to
her
silent
daughter
she
would
not
of
course
discuss
with
her
that
third
one
which
america
has
so
often
flown
to
for
solace
and
relief
only
two
said
mrs
twist
and
they
were
that
either
one
died
oneself
which
was
exactly
a
happy
thing
or
the
other
one
did
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
before
one
of
the
married
was
left
alone
to
mourn
marriage
began
rosily
no
doubt
but
it
always
ended
black
and
think
of
my
having
to
see
you
like
she
said
with
a
gesture
indicating
her
sad
dress
edith
was
intimidated
and
the
young
man
presently
went
away
whistling
he
was
the
only
one
mrs
twist
had
no
more
trouble
he
passed
entirely
from
her
mind
and
as
she
looked
at
edith
dressed
for
going
to
meet
edward
in
the
clothes
she
went
to
church
in
on
sundays
she
unconsciously
felt
a
faint
contempt
for
a
woman
who
had
had
so
much
time
to
get
married
in
and
yet
had
never
achieved
it
she
herself
had
been
married
at
twenty
and
her
hair
even
now
after
all
she
had
gone
through
was
hardly
more
gray
than
edith
your
hat
crooked
she
said
when
edith
straightened
herself
after
bending
down
to
kiss
her
and
then
after
all
unable
to
bear
the
idea
of
being
left
alone
while
edith
with
that
pleased
face
went
off
to
new
york
to
see
edward
before
she
did
she
asked
her
if
she
still
had
a
minute
to
spare
to
help
her
to
the
sofa
because
she
felt
faint
i
expect
the
excitement
has
been
too
much
for
me
she
murmured
lying
down
and
shutting
her
eyes
and
edith
disciplined
in
affection
and
attentiveness
immediately
took
off
her
hat
and
settled
down
to
getting
her
mother
well
again
in
time
for
edward
which
is
why
nobody
met
mr
twist
on
his
arrival
in
new
york
and
he
accordingly
did
things
as
will
be
seen
which
he
might
otherwise
have
done
chapter
ix
when
the
was
so
near
its
journey
end
that
people
were
packing
up
and
the
word
nantucket
was
frequent
in
the
scraps
of
talk
the
twins
heard
they
woke
up
from
the
unworried
condition
of
mind
mr
twist
kindness
and
the
dreamy
monotony
of
the
days
had
produced
in
them
and
began
to
consider
their
prospects
with
more
attention
this
attention
soon
resulted
in
anxiety
showed
hers
by
being
irritable
did
show
hers
at
all
it
was
all
very
well
so
long
as
they
were
far
away
from
america
and
never
quite
sure
that
a
submarine
might
settle
their
future
for
them
once
and
for
all
to
feel
big
vague
heroic
things
about
a
new
life
and
a
new
world
and
they
two
twinklers
going
to
conquer
it
but
when
the
new
world
was
really
upon
them
and
the
new
life
with
all
the
multitudinous
details
that
would
have
to
be
tackled
going
to
begin
in
a
few
hours
their
hearts
became
uneasy
and
sank
within
them
england
had
liked
them
suppose
america
did
like
them
either
uncle
arthur
had
liked
them
suppose
uncle
arthur
friends
did
like
them
either
their
hearts
sank
to
and
remained
in
their
boots
round
waist
safely
concealed
beneath
her
skirt
from
what
called
the
predatory
instincts
of
their
was
a
bag
containing
their
passports
a
letter
to
the
bank
where
their
was
a
letter
to
those
friends
of
uncle
who
were
to
be
tried
first
a
letter
to
those
other
friends
of
his
who
were
to
be
the
second
line
of
defence
supposing
the
first
one
failed
and
ten
pounds
in
two
notes
uncle
arthur
grievously
grumbling
and
having
previously
used
in
bed
most
of
those
vulgar
words
that
made
aunt
alice
so
miserable
had
given
one
of
the
notes
for
the
extra
expenses
of
the
journey
till
in
new
york
she
should
be
able
to
draw
on
the
though
what
expenses
there
could
be
for
a
couple
of
girls
whose
passage
was
paid
uncle
arthur
was
damned
he
alleged
if
he
knew
and
aunt
alice
had
secretly
added
the
other
this
was
all
ready
money
and
it
would
have
to
be
changed
into
dollars
before
reaching
new
york
so
as
to
be
ready
for
emergencies
on
arrival
she
judged
from
the
growing
restlessness
of
the
passengers
that
it
would
soon
be
time
to
go
and
change
it
how
many
dollars
ought
she
to
get
mr
twist
was
absent
packing
his
things
she
ought
to
have
asked
him
long
ago
but
they
seemed
so
suddenly
to
have
reached
the
end
of
their
journey
only
yesterday
there
was
the
same
old
limitless
sea
everywhere
the
same
old
feeling
that
they
were
never
going
to
arrive
now
the
waves
had
all
gone
and
one
could
actually
see
land
the
new
world
the
place
all
their
happiness
or
unhappiness
would
depend
on
she
laid
hold
of
who
was
walking
about
just
as
if
she
had
never
been
prostrate
on
a
in
her
life
and
was
going
to
say
something
appropriate
and
encouraging
on
the
christopher
and
columbus
lines
but
who
had
been
pondering
the
notes
problem
would
listen
a
dollar
said
worrying
it
out
is
like
a
shilling
or
a
mark
but
on
the
other
hand
neither
is
it
like
a
pound
no
said
brought
back
to
her
immediate
business
it
four
times
more
than
one
and
five
times
less
than
the
other
said
that
how
you
got
to
count
that
what
aunt
alice
said
yes
and
then
there
the
exchange
said
frowning
as
if
it
was
complicated
enough
already
there
the
exchange
uncle
arthur
said
we
were
to
forget
that
wanted
to
know
what
was
meant
by
the
exchange
and
unwilling
to
admit
ignorance
to
who
had
to
be
kept
in
her
proper
place
especially
when
one
was
just
getting
to
america
and
she
might
easily
become
above
herself
said
that
it
was
something
that
varied
the
exchange
you
know
varies
uncle
arthur
had
said
when
he
gave
her
the
note
you
must
keep
your
eye
on
the
variations
was
all
eagerness
to
keep
her
eye
on
them
if
only
she
had
known
what
and
where
they
were
but
one
never
asked
questions
of
uncle
arthur
his
answers
if
one
did
were
confined
to
expressions
of
anger
and
amazement
that
one
did
at
one
age
already
know
oh
said
for
a
moment
glancing
at
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
considerately
not
pressing
her
further
i
wish
mr
twist
would
come
said
uneasily
looking
in
the
direction
he
usually
appeared
from
we
wo
always
have
remarked
i
never
said
we
would
said
shortly
the
young
lady
of
the
nails
appeared
at
that
moment
in
a
hat
so
gorgeous
that
the
twins
stopped
dead
to
stare
she
had
a
veil
on
and
white
gloves
and
looked
as
if
she
were
going
for
a
walk
in
fifth
avenue
the
very
next
minute
perhaps
we
ought
to
be
getting
ready
too
said
yes
i
wish
mr
twist
would
come
perhaps
we
better
begin
and
practise
not
having
mr
twist
said
as
one
who
addresses
nobody
specially
and
means
nothing
in
particular
if
anybody
got
to
practise
that
it
be
you
said
there
be
no
one
to
roll
you
up
in
rugs
now
remember
i
wo
but
i
do
want
to
be
rolled
up
in
rugs
said
mildly
i
shall
be
walking
about
new
york
oh
see
said
irritably
she
was
worried
about
the
dollars
she
was
worried
about
the
tipping
and
the
luggage
and
the
arrival
and
uncle
arthur
friends
whose
names
were
and
clouston
sack
so
naturally
she
was
irritable
one
is
and
nobody
knew
and
understood
this
better
than
let
go
and
put
on
our
hats
and
get
ready
she
said
after
a
pause
during
which
she
wondered
whether
in
the
interests
of
restoration
to
calm
she
might
have
to
be
sick
again
she
did
hope
she
would
have
to
she
had
supposed
she
had
done
with
that
it
is
true
there
were
now
no
waves
but
she
knew
she
had
only
to
go
near
the
engines
and
smell
the
oil
let
go
and
put
on
our
hats
she
suggested
slipping
her
hand
through
arm
let
herself
be
led
away
and
they
went
to
their
cabin
and
when
they
came
out
of
it
half
an
hour
later
no
longer
with
that
bald
look
their
caps
had
given
them
the
sun
catching
the
little
rings
of
pale
gold
hair
that
showed
for
the
first
time
and
clad
instead
of
in
the
disreputable
jerseys
that
they
loved
in
neat
black
coats
and
skirts
for
they
still
wore
mourning
when
properly
dressed
with
everything
exactly
as
aunt
alice
had
directed
for
their
arrival
the
young
men
of
the
second
class
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
you
excuse
me
saying
so
said
one
of
them
to
as
she
passed
him
but
you
looking
very
well
i
expect
that
because
i
well
said
amiably
mr
twist
when
he
saw
them
threw
up
his
hands
and
ejaculated
my
yes
said
who
was
herself
puzzled
by
the
difference
the
clothes
had
made
in
after
ten
solid
days
of
cap
and
jersey
i
think
it
our
hats
they
do
somehow
seem
very
splendid
splendid
echoed
mr
twist
why
they
make
the
very
angels
jealous
and
get
pulling
off
their
haloes
and
kicking
them
over
the
edge
of
heaven
what
is
so
wonderful
is
that
aunt
alice
should
ever
have
squeezed
them
out
of
uncle
arthur
said
gazing
lost
in
admiration
at
he
did
disgorge
nice
hats
easily
at
all
and
one
of
the
german
ladies
muttered
to
the
other
as
her
eye
fell
on
ja
die
hat
and
it
was
only
because
it
was
the
other
german
lady
hair
that
spent
the
night
in
a
different
part
of
the
cabin
from
her
head
and
had
been
seen
doing
it
by
that
she
cavilled
and
was
grudging
she
muttered
back
auf
der
nase
die
nase
aber
entfremdet
mich
die
ist
keine
echte
so
that
the
twinklers
had
quite
a
success
and
their
hearts
came
a
little
way
out
of
their
boots
only
a
little
way
though
for
there
were
the
clouston
sacks
looming
bigger
into
their
lives
every
minute
now
really
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
as
aunt
alice
used
to
say
that
does
make
such
a
difference
a
clear
pale
loveliness
of
light
lay
over
new
york
and
there
was
a
funny
sprightliness
in
the
air
a
delicate
dry
crispness
the
trees
on
the
shore
when
they
got
close
were
delicate
too
delicate
pale
gold
and
green
and
brown
and
they
seemed
so
composed
and
calm
the
twins
thought
standing
there
quietly
after
the
upheavals
and
fidgetiness
of
the
atlantic
new
york
was
well
into
the
fall
the
time
of
year
when
it
gets
nearest
to
beauty
the
beauty
was
entirely
in
the
atmosphere
and
the
lights
and
shadows
it
made
it
was
like
an
exquisite
veil
flung
over
an
ugly
woman
hiding
softening
encouraging
hopes
everybody
on
the
ship
was
crowding
eagerly
to
the
sides
everybody
was
exhilarated
and
excited
and
ready
to
be
friendly
and
talkative
they
all
waved
whenever
another
boat
passed
those
who
knew
america
pointed
out
the
landmarks
to
those
who
did
mr
twist
pointed
them
out
to
the
twins
and
so
did
the
young
man
who
had
remarked
favourably
on
looks
and
as
they
did
it
simultaneously
and
there
was
so
much
to
look
at
and
so
many
boats
to
wave
to
it
was
till
they
had
actually
got
to
the
statue
of
liberty
that
remembered
her
and
the
dollars
the
young
man
was
saying
how
much
the
statue
of
liberty
had
cost
and
the
word
dollars
made
turn
with
a
jump
to
mr
twist
oh
she
exclaimed
clutching
at
her
chamois
leather
bag
where
it
very
visibly
bulged
out
beneath
her
waistband
i
forgot
i
must
get
change
and
how
much
do
you
think
we
ought
to
tip
the
stewardess
i
never
tipped
anybody
yet
ever
and
i
wish
i
wish
i
had
to
she
got
quite
red
it
seemed
to
her
dreadful
to
offer
money
to
someone
so
much
older
than
herself
and
who
till
almost
that
very
morning
had
treated
her
and
like
the
naughtiest
of
tiresome
children
surely
she
would
be
most
offended
at
being
tipped
by
people
such
years
younger
than
herself
mr
twist
thought
not
a
dollar
said
the
young
man
one
dollar
that
the
figure
not
a
cent
more
or
you
girls
get
inflating
prices
and
wall
street
bust
up
not
heeding
him
and
clutching
nervously
the
place
where
her
bag
was
told
mr
twist
that
the
stewardess
had
seemed
to
mind
them
quite
so
much
last
night
and
still
less
that
morning
and
perhaps
some
little
memento
something
that
was
money
give
her
those
caps
of
yours
said
the
young
man
bursting
into
hilarity
but
indeed
it
was
his
fault
that
he
was
a
low
young
man
mr
twist
shutting
him
out
of
the
conversation
by
interposing
a
shoulder
told
he
had
noticed
stewardesses
and
also
stewards
softened
when
journeys
drew
near
their
end
but
that
it
did
mean
they
wanted
mementos
they
wanted
money
and
he
would
do
the
tipping
for
her
if
she
liked
jumped
at
it
this
tipping
of
the
stewardess
had
haunted
her
at
intervals
throughout
the
journey
whenever
she
woke
up
at
night
she
felt
that
not
having
yet
in
her
life
tipped
anybody
it
was
very
hard
that
she
could
begin
with
somebody
more
her
own
size
then
if
you
do
mind
coming
behind
the
funnel
she
said
i
can
give
you
my
notes
and
perhaps
you
would
get
them
changed
for
me
and
deduct
what
you
think
the
stewardess
ought
to
have
mr
twist
and
also
who
was
allowed
to
stay
behind
with
the
exuberant
young
man
though
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
his
presence
went
with
behind
the
funnel
where
after
a
great
deal
of
private
fumbling
her
back
turned
to
them
she
produced
the
two
notes
the
steward
ought
to
have
something
too
said
mr
twist
oh
i
be
glad
if
you
do
him
as
well
said
eagerly
i
do
think
i
offer
him
a
tip
he
has
been
so
fatherly
to
us
and
imagine
offering
to
tip
one
father
mr
twist
laughed
and
said
she
would
get
over
this
feeling
in
time
he
promised
to
do
what
was
right
and
to
make
it
clear
that
the
tips
he
bestowed
were
twinkler
tips
and
presently
he
came
back
with
messages
of
thanks
from
the
tipped
such
polite
ones
from
the
stewardess
that
the
twins
were
astonished
and
gave
a
packet
of
very
slices
of
green
paper
which
were
dollar
bills
he
said
besides
a
variety
of
strange
coins
which
he
spread
out
on
a
ledge
and
explained
to
her
the
exchange
was
favourable
to
you
said
mr
twist
counting
out
the
money
how
nice
of
it
said
politely
did
you
keep
your
eye
on
its
variations
she
added
a
little
loudly
with
a
view
to
rousing
respect
in
who
was
lounging
against
a
seat
and
showing
a
total
absence
of
every
kind
of
appropriate
emotion
certainly
said
mr
twist
after
a
slight
pause
i
kept
both
my
eyes
on
all
of
them
mr
twist
had
it
appeared
presented
the
steward
and
stewardess
each
with
a
dollar
on
behalf
of
the
misses
twinkler
but
because
the
exchange
was
so
favourable
this
had
made
no
difference
to
the
notes
reducing
each
note
into
german
marks
which
was
the
way
the
twinklers
in
spite
of
a
year
in
england
still
dealt
in
their
heads
with
money
before
they
could
get
a
clear
idea
of
it
there
would
have
been
two
hundred
marks
and
as
it
took
roughly
four
marks
to
make
a
dollar
the
two
hundred
marks
would
have
to
be
divided
by
four
which
leaving
aside
that
extra
complication
of
variations
in
the
exchange
and
regarding
the
exchange
for
a
moment
and
for
purposes
of
simplification
as
keeping
quiet
for
a
bit
and
resting
should
produce
also
roughly
said
a
little
out
of
breath
as
she
got
to
the
end
of
her
calculation
fifty
dollars
correct
said
mr
twist
who
had
listened
with
respectful
attention
here
they
are
i
said
roughly
said
it
ca
be
fifty
dollars
the
tips
anyhow
would
alter
that
yes
but
you
forget
the
exchange
was
silent
she
did
want
to
go
into
that
before
of
the
two
she
was
supposed
to
be
the
least
bad
at
sums
their
mother
had
put
it
that
way
refusing
to
say
as
industriously
tried
to
trap
her
into
saying
that
she
was
the
better
of
the
two
but
even
so
the
difference
entitled
her
to
authority
on
the
subject
with
and
by
dint
of
doing
all
her
calculations
roughly
as
she
was
careful
to
describe
her
method
she
allowed
room
for
withdrawal
and
escape
where
otherwise
the
inflexibility
of
figures
might
have
caught
her
tight
and
held
her
down
while
looked
on
and
was
unable
to
respect
her
evidently
the
exchange
was
something
beneficent
she
decided
to
rejoice
in
it
in
silence
accept
whatever
it
did
and
refrain
from
asking
questions
so
i
did
of
course
the
exchange
she
said
after
a
little
she
gathered
up
the
dollar
bills
and
began
packing
them
into
her
bag
they
would
all
go
in
and
she
had
to
put
the
rest
into
her
pocket
for
which
also
there
were
too
many
but
she
refused
offer
to
put
some
of
them
in
hers
on
the
ground
that
sooner
or
later
she
would
be
sure
to
forget
they
were
her
handkerchief
and
would
blow
her
nose
with
them
thank
you
very
much
for
being
so
kind
she
said
to
mr
twist
as
she
stuffed
her
pocket
full
and
tried
by
vigorous
patting
to
get
it
to
look
inconspicuous
we
never
going
to
forget
you
and
me
write
to
you
often
and
we
come
and
see
you
as
often
as
you
like
yes
said
dreamily
as
she
watched
the
shore
of
long
island
sliding
past
of
course
you
got
your
relations
but
relations
soon
pall
and
you
may
be
quite
glad
after
a
while
of
a
little
fresh
blood
mr
twist
thought
this
very
likely
and
agreed
with
several
other
things
generalizing
from
uncle
arthur
said
about
relations
again
with
that
air
of
addressing
nobody
specially
and
meaning
nothing
in
particular
while
wrestled
with
the
obesity
of
her
pocket
whether
you
come
to
see
me
or
not
said
mr
twist
whose
misgivings
as
to
the
effect
of
the
twinklers
on
his
mother
grew
rather
than
subsided
i
shall
certainly
come
to
see
you
perhaps
sack
wo
allow
followers
said
her
eyes
far
away
uncle
arthur
did
he
would
let
the
maids
have
any
so
they
had
to
go
out
and
do
the
following
themselves
we
had
a
follower
once
did
we
she
continued
her
voice
pensive
and
reminiscent
he
was
a
friend
of
uncle
arthur
quite
old
at
least
thirty
or
forty
i
should
have
thought
he
follow
but
he
did
and
he
used
to
come
home
to
tea
with
uncle
arthur
and
produce
boxes
of
chocolate
for
us
out
of
his
pockets
when
uncle
arthur
was
looking
we
ate
them
and
felt
perfectly
well
disposed
toward
him
till
one
day
he
tried
to
kiss
one
of
us
i
forget
which
and
that
combined
with
the
chocolates
revealed
him
in
his
true
colours
as
a
follower
and
we
told
him
they
were
allowed
in
that
house
and
urged
him
to
go
to
some
place
where
they
were
or
he
would
certainly
be
overtaken
by
uncle
vengeance
and
we
said
how
surprised
we
were
because
he
was
so
old
and
we
did
know
followers
were
as
old
as
that
ever
it
seemed
a
very
shady
thing
said
having
subdued
the
swollenness
of
her
pocket
to
eat
his
chocolates
and
then
not
want
to
kiss
him
but
we
do
hold
with
kissing
and
me
still
we
were
full
of
his
chocolates
there
was
no
getting
away
from
that
so
we
talked
it
over
after
he
had
gone
and
decided
that
next
day
when
he
came
we
tell
him
he
might
kiss
one
of
us
if
he
still
wanted
to
and
we
drew
lots
which
it
was
to
be
and
it
was
me
and
i
filled
myself
to
the
brim
with
chocolates
so
as
to
feel
grateful
enough
to
bear
it
but
he
come
no
said
he
did
come
again
for
a
long
while
and
when
he
did
there
was
no
follow
left
in
him
quite
the
contrary
mr
twist
listened
with
the
more
interest
to
this
story
because
it
was
the
first
time
had
talked
since
he
knew
her
he
was
used
to
the
inspiriting
and
voluble
conversation
of
who
had
looked
upon
him
as
her
best
friend
since
the
day
he
had
wiped
up
her
tears
but
had
been
too
unwell
to
talk
she
had
uttered
languid
and
brief
observations
from
time
to
time
with
her
eyes
shut
and
her
head
lolling
loosely
on
her
neck
but
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
as
it
were
an
ordinary
human
being
standing
upright
on
her
feet
walking
about
looking
intelligently
if
pensively
at
the
scenery
and
in
a
condition
of
affable
readiness
it
appeared
to
converse
mr
twist
was
a
born
mother
the
more
trouble
he
was
given
the
more
attached
he
became
he
had
rolled
up
in
rugs
so
often
that
to
be
not
going
to
roll
her
up
any
more
was
depressing
to
him
he
was
beginning
to
perceive
this
motherliness
in
him
himself
and
he
gazed
through
his
spectacles
at
while
she
sketched
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
follower
and
wondered
with
an
almost
painful
solicitude
what
her
fate
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
clouston
sacks
equally
he
wondered
as
to
the
other
one
fate
for
he
could
not
think
of
one
twinkler
without
thinking
of
the
other
they
were
inextricably
mixed
together
in
the
impression
they
had
produced
on
him
and
they
dwelt
together
in
his
thoughts
as
one
person
called
generally
twinklers
he
stood
gazing
at
them
his
motherly
instincts
uppermost
his
hearty
yearning
over
them
now
that
the
hour
of
parting
was
so
near
and
his
carefully
tended
chickens
were
going
to
be
torn
from
beneath
his
wing
mr
twist
was
domestic
he
was
affectionate
he
would
have
loved
though
he
had
never
known
it
the
sensation
of
pattering
feet
about
his
house
and
small
hands
clinging
to
the
apron
he
would
never
wear
and
it
was
entirely
characteristic
of
him
that
his
invention
the
invention
that
brought
him
his
fortune
should
have
had
to
do
with
a
teapot
but
if
his
heart
was
uneasy
within
him
at
the
prospect
of
parting
from
his
charges
their
hearts
were
equally
uneasy
though
not
in
the
same
way
the
very
name
of
clouston
sack
was
repugnant
to
and
less
quick
at
disliking
turned
it
over
cautiously
in
her
mind
as
one
who
turns
over
an
unknown
and
distasteful
object
with
the
nose
of
his
umbrella
even
she
could
quite
believe
that
any
good
thing
could
come
out
of
a
name
like
that
especially
when
it
had
got
into
their
lives
through
uncle
arthur
mr
twist
had
never
heard
of
the
clouston
sacks
which
made
still
more
distrustful
she
in
the
least
encouraged
when
he
explained
the
bigness
of
america
and
that
nobody
in
it
ever
knew
everybody
she
just
said
that
everybody
had
heard
of
roosevelt
and
her
heart
was
too
doubtful
within
her
even
to
mind
being
told
as
he
did
immediately
tell
her
within
of
that
her
reply
was
unreasonable
just
at
the
end
as
they
were
all
three
straining
their
eyes
no
one
with
more
anxiety
than
mr
twist
to
try
and
guess
which
of
the
crowd
on
the
were
the
clouston
sacks
they
passed
on
their
other
side
the
the
great
interned
german
liner
at
its
moorings
and
the
young
man
who
had
previously
been
so
very
familiar
as
said
but
who
was
only
mr
twist
explained
being
american
came
hurrying
boldly
up
you
must
miss
this
he
said
to
actually
seizing
her
by
the
arm
here
something
that
make
you
feel
right
away
and
he
led
her
off
and
would
have
dragged
her
off
but
for
perfect
he
being
familiar
said
to
mr
twist
turning
very
red
and
following
quickly
after
him
that
not
just
being
american
everybody
decent
knows
that
if
there
any
laying
hold
of
people
arms
to
be
done
one
begins
with
the
eldest
sister
perhaps
he
does
realize
that
you
the
elder
said
mr
twist
strangers
judge
roughly
by
size
i
afraid
i
going
to
have
trouble
with
her
said
not
heeding
his
consolations
it
is
a
sinecure
i
assure
you
being
left
sole
guardian
and
protector
of
somebody
as
pretty
as
all
that
and
the
worst
of
it
is
she
going
on
getting
prettier
she
has
nearly
come
to
the
end
of
what
she
can
do
in
that
direction
i
see
it
growing
on
her
every
sunday
she
inches
prettier
than
she
was
the
sunday
before
and
wherever
i
take
her
to
live
and
however
out
of
the
way
it
is
sure
the
path
to
our
front
door
is
going
to
be
black
with
suitors
this
dreadful
picture
so
much
perturbed
her
and
she
looked
up
at
mr
twist
with
such
worried
eyes
that
he
could
refrain
from
patting
her
on
her
shoulder
there
there
said
mr
twist
and
he
begged
her
to
be
sure
to
let
him
know
directly
she
was
in
the
least
difficulty
or
even
perplexity
about
the
suitors
for
instance
or
anything
else
you
must
let
me
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
you
know
he
said
but
we
should
like
it
at
all
if
we
thought
you
were
practising
being
useful
on
us
said
it
wholly
foreign
to
our
natures
to
enjoy
being
the
objects
of
anybody
philanthropy
now
i
just
wonder
where
you
get
all
your
long
words
from
said
mr
twist
soothingly
and
laughed
and
there
was
only
one
dimple
in
the
twinkler
family
and
had
got
it
what
do
you
want
to
get
looking
at
for
she
asked
when
she
had
edged
through
the
crowd
staring
at
the
and
got
to
where
stood
listening
abstractedly
to
the
fireworks
of
american
slang
the
young
man
was
treating
her
to
that
terse
surprising
swift
form
of
speech
which
she
was
hearing
in
such
abundance
for
the
first
time
the
american
passengers
appeared
one
and
all
to
be
rejoicing
over
the
impotence
of
the
great
ship
every
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
violently
derisively
conjecturing
the
feelings
of
the
as
every
day
under
her
very
nose
british
ships
arrived
and
departed
and
presently
arrived
again
the
same
ships
she
had
seen
depart
coming
back
unharmed
unhindered
by
her
country
submarines
only
the
two
german
ladies
once
more
ignoring
their
american
allegiance
looked
angry
it
was
incredible
to
them
simply
as
they
said
in
their
thoughts
that
any
nation
should
dare
inconvenience
germans
should
dare
lay
a
finger
even
the
merest
friendliest
detaining
one
on
anything
belonging
to
the
mighty
the
inviolable
empire
well
these
americans
these
yankees
would
soon
get
taught
a
sharp
deserved
lesson
but
at
this
point
they
suddenly
remembered
they
were
americans
themselves
and
pulled
up
their
thoughts
violently
as
it
were
on
their
haunches
they
turned
however
bitterly
to
the
twinkler
girl
as
she
pushed
her
way
through
to
her
sister
those
renegade
junkers
those
contemptible
little
apostates
and
asked
her
after
hearing
her
question
to
with
an
extraordinary
breaking
out
of
emotion
where
she
then
supposed
she
would
have
been
at
that
moment
if
it
had
been
for
germany
not
here
i
think
said
instantly
and
fatally
ready
as
she
always
was
to
answer
back
and
attempt
what
she
called
reasoned
conversation
there
would
have
been
a
war
so
of
course
i
have
been
here
why
you
would
so
much
as
have
been
born
without
germany
said
the
lady
whose
hair
came
off
with
difficulty
controlling
a
desire
to
shake
this
insolent
and
perverted
junker
who
could
repeat
the
infamous
english
lie
as
to
who
began
the
war
you
owe
your
very
existence
to
germany
you
should
be
giving
thanks
to
her
on
your
knees
for
her
gift
to
you
of
life
instead
of
jeering
at
this
representative
she
flung
a
finger
out
toward
the
this
patient
and
representative
of
her
power
i
was
jeering
said
defending
herself
and
clutching
at
sleeve
to
pull
her
away
you
would
have
had
a
father
at
all
but
for
germany
said
the
other
lady
the
one
whose
hair
grew
and
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
said
the
first
one
where
you
would
have
been
i
do
believe
said
her
nose
in
the
air
i
believe
i
have
ever
been
at
a
loss
for
a
father
the
ladies
left
speechless
a
moment
by
the
arrogance
as
well
as
several
other
things
about
this
answer
gave
an
opportunity
for
further
reasoning
with
them
which
she
was
unable
to
resist
there
are
lots
of
fathers
she
said
in
england
who
would
i
sure
have
been
delighted
to
take
me
on
if
germany
had
failed
me
england
take
you
on
an
english
father
for
you
for
a
subject
of
the
king
of
prussia
i
i
afraid
i
i
going
to
be
sick
gasped
suddenly
you
never
going
to
be
sick
in
this
bit
of
bathwater
miss
twinkler
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
the
instant
ungrudging
admiration
of
one
who
is
confronted
by
real
talent
my
what
a
gift
darted
at
drooping
head
that
which
she
had
been
going
to
say
back
to
the
german
ladies
dissolving
on
her
tongue
oh
no
she
wailed
oh
not
in
your
best
hat
columbus
darling
you
ca
it
not
done
and
your
hat
shake
off
into
the
water
and
then
there
only
be
one
between
us
and
we
shall
never
be
able
to
go
out
paying
calls
and
things
at
the
same
time
come
away
and
sit
down
mr
twist
mr
twist
oh
please
come
allowed
herself
to
be
led
away
just
in
time
as
she
murmured
and
sat
down
on
the
nearest
seat
and
shut
her
eyes
she
was
thankful
attention
had
been
diverted
to
her
so
instantly
for
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
be
sick
with
the
ship
as
quiet
as
one
own
bedroom
nothing
short
of
the
could
have
made
her
sick
now
she
sat
keeping
her
eyes
shut
and
attention
riveted
wondering
what
she
would
do
when
there
was
no
ship
and
was
on
the
verge
of
hasty
and
unfortunate
argument
would
she
have
to
learn
to
faint
but
that
would
terrify
poor
christopher
so
dreadfully
pondered
her
eyes
shut
on
this
situation
up
to
now
in
her
life
she
had
always
found
that
situations
solved
themselves
given
time
and
sometimes
a
little
assistance
so
no
doubt
would
this
one
would
ripen
and
mellow
the
german
ladies
would
depart
hence
and
be
no
more
seen
and
it
was
unlikely
she
and
would
meet
at
such
close
quarters
as
a
ship
cabin
any
persons
so
peculiarly
and
unusually
afflicting
again
all
situations
solved
themselves
or
if
they
showed
signs
of
not
going
to
one
adopted
the
gentle
methods
that
helped
them
to
get
solved
early
in
life
she
had
discovered
that
objects
which
can
not
be
removed
or
climbed
over
can
be
walked
round
a
little
deviousness
and
the
thing
was
done
she
herself
had
in
the
most
masterly
manner
when
she
was
four
escaped
for
several
years
by
a
simple
method
that
seemed
to
her
looking
back
very
like
an
inspiration
of
getting
round
it
she
had
never
objected
to
going
had
never
put
into
words
the
powerful
if
vague
dislike
with
which
it
filled
her
when
sunday
after
sunday
she
had
to
go
and
dangle
her
legs
helplessly
for
two
hours
from
the
chair
she
was
put
on
in
the
enclosed
pew
reserved
for
the
gräfliche
from
the
slosh
her
father
a
strict
observer
of
the
correct
and
a
pious
believer
in
god
for
other
people
attended
divine
service
as
regularly
as
he
wound
the
clocks
and
paid
the
accounts
he
as
the
german
phrase
went
and
his
wife
and
children
were
expected
to
too
which
they
did
uncomplainingly
for
when
one
has
to
do
with
determined
husbands
and
fathers
it
is
quickest
not
to
complain
but
the
pins
and
needles
that
patient
child
endured
remembered
looking
back
through
the
years
at
the
figure
on
the
chair
as
at
a
stranger
were
something
awful
the
edge
of
the
chair
just
caught
her
legs
in
the
pins
and
needles
place
if
she
had
been
a
little
bigger
or
a
little
smaller
it
would
have
happened
as
it
was
paul
wrestling
with
beasts
at
ephesus
was
more
heroic
than
perceived
that
distant
child
to
have
been
silently
sunday
after
sunday
bearing
her
legs
then
one
sunday
something
snapped
inside
her
and
she
heard
her
own
voice
floating
out
into
the
void
above
the
heads
of
the
mumbling
worshippers
and
it
said
with
a
terrible
distinctness
in
a
sort
of
monotonous
wail
i
only
had
a
cold
potato
for
breakfast
and
a
second
time
in
the
breathless
suspension
of
mumbling
that
followed
upon
this
i
only
had
a
cold
potato
for
breakfast
and
a
third
time
she
opened
her
mouth
to
repeat
the
outrageous
statement
regardless
of
her
mother
startled
hand
laid
on
her
arm
and
of
petrified
stare
and
of
the
lifted
faces
of
the
congregation
and
of
the
bent
scandalized
brows
of
the
pastor
impelled
by
something
that
possessed
her
unable
to
do
anything
but
obey
it
but
her
father
a
man
of
deeds
rose
up
in
his
place
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
church
and
the
minute
she
found
herself
really
rescued
and
out
where
the
sun
and
wind
her
friends
were
larking
about
among
the
tombstones
she
laid
her
cheek
as
affectionately
against
her
father
head
as
if
she
were
a
daughter
to
be
proud
of
and
would
have
purred
if
she
had
had
had
a
purr
as
loudly
as
the
most
satisfied
and
virtuous
of
cats
said
her
father
standing
her
up
on
a
convenient
tomb
so
that
her
eyes
were
level
with
his
is
it
then
true
about
the
cold
potato
no
said
patting
his
face
pleased
at
what
her
legs
were
feeling
like
again
said
her
father
do
you
not
know
it
is
wrong
to
lie
no
said
placidly
the
heavenly
blue
of
her
eyes
gazing
straight
into
his
exactly
like
the
mild
sky
above
the
trees
no
echoed
her
father
staring
at
her
but
you
know
what
a
lie
is
no
said
gazing
at
him
tenderly
in
her
satisfaction
at
being
restored
to
a
decent
pair
of
legs
and
as
he
still
stood
staring
at
her
she
put
her
hands
one
on
each
of
his
cheeks
and
squeezed
his
face
together
and
murmured
oh
i
do
you
chapter
x
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
a
distant
past
sat
with
her
eyes
shut
long
after
she
need
have
she
had
forgotten
about
the
german
ladies
and
america
and
the
future
so
instantly
pressing
on
her
and
was
away
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
again
where
bits
of
amber
where
washed
up
after
a
storm
and
the
pale
rushes
grew
in
shallow
sunny
water
that
was
hardly
salt
and
the
air
seemed
for
ever
sweet
with
lilac
all
the
cottage
gardens
in
the
little
village
that
clustered
round
a
clearing
in
the
trees
had
lilac
bushes
in
them
for
there
was
something
in
the
soil
that
made
lilacs
be
more
wonderful
there
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
and
in
may
the
whole
forest
as
far
as
one
could
walk
was
soaked
with
the
smell
of
it
after
rain
on
a
may
evening
what
a
wonder
it
was
what
a
wonder
that
running
down
the
black
oozing
forest
paths
between
wet
pine
stems
out
on
to
the
shore
to
look
at
the
sun
setting
below
the
great
sullen
clouds
of
the
afternoon
over
on
one
left
where
denmark
was
and
that
lifting
of
one
face
to
the
exquisite
mingling
of
the
delicate
sea
smell
and
the
lilac
and
then
there
was
home
to
come
back
to
when
the
forest
began
to
look
too
dark
and
its
deep
silence
made
one
flesh
creep
home
and
a
light
in
the
window
where
ones
mother
was
incredible
the
security
of
those
days
the
safe
warmth
of
them
the
careless
roominess
you
know
if
you
manage
to
feel
a
little
better
said
voice
entreatingly
in
her
ear
it
time
we
began
to
get
off
this
ship
opened
her
eyes
and
got
up
all
confused
and
everybody
had
melted
away
from
that
part
of
the
deck
except
herself
and
the
ship
was
lying
quiet
at
last
alongside
the
wharf
she
had
being
ill
this
time
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
having
wandered
off
so
easily
and
comfortably
into
the
past
and
left
poor
christopher
alone
in
the
difficult
present
i
so
sorry
she
said
smiling
apologetically
and
giving
her
hat
a
tug
of
determination
symbolic
of
her
being
ready
for
anything
especially
america
i
think
i
must
have
gone
to
sleep
have
you
she
hesitated
and
dropped
her
voice
are
they
are
the
clouston
sacks
visible
yet
i
thought
i
saw
them
said
dropping
her
voice
too
and
looking
round
uneasily
over
her
shoulder
i
have
come
here
sooner
to
see
how
you
were
getting
on
but
i
thought
i
saw
them
and
they
looked
so
like
what
i
think
they
will
look
like
that
i
went
into
our
cabin
again
for
a
few
minutes
but
it
was
them
they
found
the
people
they
were
after
and
have
gone
there
a
great
crowd
waiting
said
mr
twist
coming
up
and
i
think
we
ought
to
go
and
look
for
your
friends
as
you
do
know
what
like
and
they
do
know
what
you
like
it
may
be
difficult
heaven
forbid
he
continued
that
i
should
hurry
you
but
i
have
to
catch
a
train
if
i
to
get
home
and
i
do
intend
to
catch
it
until
i
handed
you
over
safely
to
the
sacks
those
sacks
began
and
then
she
finished
irrelevantly
by
remarking
that
it
was
the
details
of
life
that
were
discouraging
from
which
anna
felicitas
knew
that
christopher
heart
was
once
more
in
her
boots
come
along
said
mr
twist
urging
them
to
wards
the
gangway
anything
you
got
to
say
about
life
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
but
at
some
time
when
we
more
at
leisure
it
had
never
occurred
to
either
of
the
twins
that
the
clouston
sacks
would
not
meet
them
they
had
taken
it
for
granted
from
the
beginning
that
some
form
of
sack
either
male
or
female
or
at
least
their
plenipotentiary
would
be
on
the
wharf
to
take
them
away
to
the
sack
lair
as
alluded
to
the
family
mansion
it
was
they
knew
in
boston
but
boston
conveyed
nothing
to
them
only
mr
twist
knew
how
far
away
it
was
he
had
always
supposed
the
sacks
would
meet
their
young
charges
stay
that
night
in
new
york
and
continue
on
to
boston
next
day
the
twins
were
so
certain
they
would
be
met
that
mr
twist
was
certain
too
he
had
concluded
with
a
growingly
empty
feeling
in
his
heart
as
the
time
of
separation
drew
near
that
all
that
now
remained
for
him
to
do
on
behalf
of
the
twinklers
was
to
hand
them
over
to
the
sacks
and
then
leave
them
and
then
go
home
to
that
mother
he
loved
but
had
for
some
time
known
he
did
like
go
home
a
bereft
and
lonely
man
but
out
of
the
crowd
on
the
pier
any
of
whom
might
have
been
sacks
for
all
the
twinklers
eagerly
scanning
faces
knew
nobody
in
fact
seemed
to
be
sacks
at
least
nobody
came
forward
and
said
are
you
the
twinklers
other
people
fell
into
each
other
arms
the
air
was
full
of
the
noise
of
kissing
the
loud
legitimate
kissing
of
relations
but
nobody
took
any
notice
of
the
twins
for
a
long
while
they
stood
waiting
their
luggage
was
examined
and
mr
twist
luggage
only
his
was
baggage
was
examined
and
the
kissing
and
exclaiming
crowd
swayed
hither
and
thither
and
broke
up
into
groups
and
was
shot
through
by
interviewers
and
got
packed
off
into
taxis
and
grew
thinner
and
thinner
and
at
last
was
so
thin
that
the
concealment
of
the
sacks
in
it
was
no
longer
possible
there
were
no
sacks
to
the
last
few
groups
of
people
left
in
the
great
hall
piled
with
bags
of
wool
and
sulphur
mr
twist
went
up
boldly
and
asked
if
they
were
intending
to
meet
some
young
ladies
called
twinkler
his
tone
owing
to
perturbation
was
rather
more
than
one
of
inquiry
it
almost
sounded
menacing
and
the
answers
he
got
were
cold
he
wandered
about
uncertainly
from
group
to
group
his
soft
felt
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
brow
getting
more
and
more
puckered
and
anxiously
looking
on
from
afar
became
impatient
at
last
of
these
refusals
of
everybody
to
be
sacks
and
thought
that
perhaps
mr
twist
was
making
himself
clear
impetuous
by
nature
and
little
given
to
calm
waiting
she
approached
a
group
on
her
own
account
and
asked
them
enunciating
her
words
very
clearly
whether
they
were
by
any
chance
and
clouston
sack
the
group
which
was
entirely
female
stared
round
and
down
at
her
in
astonished
silence
and
shook
its
heads
and
as
she
saw
mr
twist
being
turned
away
for
the
fifth
time
in
the
distance
a
wave
of
red
despair
came
over
her
and
she
said
reproach
in
her
voice
and
tears
in
her
eyes
but
got
to
be
the
sacks
upon
which
the
group
she
was
addressing
stared
at
her
in
a
more
astonished
silence
than
ever
mr
twist
came
up
mopping
his
brow
and
took
he
arm
and
led
her
back
to
who
was
taking
care
of
the
luggage
and
had
sat
down
philosophically
to
await
developments
on
a
bag
of
sulphur
she
yet
know
what
sulphur
looked
like
on
one
clothes
after
one
has
sat
on
it
and
smiled
cheerfully
and
encouragingly
at
as
she
came
towards
her
there
no
sacks
said
facing
the
truth
it
exactly
like
that
uncle
arthur
of
yours
said
mr
twist
mopping
his
forehead
and
speaking
almost
vindictively
exactly
like
him
a
man
like
that
have
the
sort
of
friends
that
do
meet
one
well
we
must
do
without
the
sacks
said
rising
from
the
sulphur
bag
with
the
look
of
serene
courage
that
can
only
dwell
on
the
face
of
one
who
is
free
from
care
as
to
what
has
happened
to
him
behind
and
it
is
she
added
sweetly
to
mr
twist
as
if
we
got
yes
said
suddenly
seeing
daylight
of
course
what
do
sacks
really
matter
i
mean
for
a
day
or
two
you
take
us
somewhere
where
we
can
wait
till
we
found
them
yes
said
some
nice
quiet
sort
of
place
like
the
one
the
brontes
went
to
in
paul
churchyard
the
first
time
they
were
launched
into
the
world
yes
some
inexpensive
place
suited
to
the
frugal
because
although
we
got
even
that
will
need
watching
or
it
will
go
during
this
conversation
mr
twist
stood
mopping
his
forehead
as
often
as
he
mopped
it
it
broke
out
afresh
and
had
to
be
mopped
again
they
were
the
only
passengers
left
now
and
had
become
very
conspicuous
he
could
but
perceive
that
a
group
of
officials
with
grim
mouths
were
eyeing
him
and
the
twinklers
attentively
always
zealous
in
the
cause
of
virtue
america
provided
her
wharves
and
with
officials
specially
appointed
to
guard
the
purity
of
family
life
family
life
obviously
can
not
be
pure
without
a
marriage
being
either
in
it
or
having
at
some
time
or
other
passed
through
it
the
officials
engaged
in
eyeing
mr
twist
and
the
twins
were
all
married
themselves
and
were
well
acquainted
with
that
awful
purity
but
eye
the
twist
and
twinkler
party
as
they
might
they
could
see
no
trace
of
marriage
anywhere
about
it
on
the
contrary
the
man
of
the
party
looked
so
uneasy
that
it
amounted
to
conscious
illegality
sisters
said
the
chief
official
stepping
forward
abruptly
eh
said
mr
twist
pausing
in
the
wiping
of
his
forehead
these
here
said
the
official
jerking
his
thumb
at
the
twins
they
your
sisters
no
said
mr
twist
stiffly
no
said
the
twins
with
one
voice
do
you
think
we
look
like
him
daughters
no
said
mr
twist
stiffly
no
said
the
twins
with
an
ever
greater
vigour
of
repudiation
you
really
think
we
look
as
much
like
him
as
all
that
wife
and
then
the
twinklers
laughed
they
laughed
aloud
even
forgetting
her
cares
for
a
moment
but
they
were
flattered
because
it
was
at
least
a
proof
that
they
looked
thoroughly
then
if
they
ai
your
sisters
and
they
ai
your
daughters
and
they
ai
your
wife
and
you
tell
me
these
young
ladies
are
not
anything
at
all
of
mine
sir
said
mr
twist
vehemently
do
you
get
me
now
said
the
official
sticking
out
his
jaw
this
is
a
free
country
and
i
have
no
darned
cheek
these
young
ladies
in
no
way
belong
to
me
said
mr
twist
more
patiently
they
my
friends
oh
friends
are
they
then
you
tell
me
what
you
going
to
do
with
them
next
do
with
them
repeated
mr
twist
as
he
stared
with
puckered
brow
at
the
twins
that
exactly
what
i
wish
i
knew
the
official
scanned
him
from
head
to
foot
with
triumphant
contempt
he
had
got
one
of
them
anyhow
he
felt
quite
refreshed
already
there
had
been
a
slump
in
sinners
the
past
week
and
he
was
as
full
of
suppressed
energy
and
as
much
tormented
by
it
as
an
unexercised
and
overfed
horse
step
this
way
he
ordered
curtly
waving
mr
twist
towards
a
wooden
erection
that
was
apparently
an
office
oh
do
you
worry
about
the
girls
he
added
as
his
prey
seemed
disinclined
to
leave
them
but
mr
twist
did
worry
he
saw
ellis
island
looming
up
behind
the
two
figures
that
were
looking
on
in
an
astonishment
that
had
not
yet
had
time
to
turn
into
dismay
as
he
was
marched
off
out
of
sight
i
be
back
in
a
minute
he
called
over
his
shoulder
that
as
may
be
remarked
the
official
grimly
but
he
was
back
if
not
in
a
minute
in
a
little
more
than
five
minutes
still
accompanied
by
the
official
but
an
official
magically
changed
into
tameness
and
amiability
desirous
to
help
instructing
his
inferiors
to
carry
mr
twist
and
the
young
ladies
baggage
to
a
taxi
it
was
the
teapot
that
had
saved
him
that
blessed
teapot
that
was
always
protruding
itself
benevolently
into
his
life
mr
twist
had
identified
himself
with
it
and
it
had
instantly
saved
him
in
the
shelter
of
his
teapot
mr
twist
could
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
in
america
everybody
had
it
everybody
knew
it
it
was
as
pervasive
of
america
as
ford
cars
but
cosily
quietly
pervasive
it
was
only
less
visible
because
it
stayed
at
home
it
was
more
like
a
wife
than
cars
were
from
a
sinner
caught
mr
twist
its
amiable
creator
leapt
to
the
position
of
one
who
can
do
no
wrong
for
he
had
not
only
placed
his
teapot
between
himself
and
judgment
but
had
accompanied
his
proofs
of
identity
by
a
suitable
number
of
dollar
bills
pressed
inconspicuously
into
the
official
conveniently
placed
hand
the
twins
found
themselves
being
treated
with
distinction
they
were
helped
into
the
taxi
by
the
official
himself
and
what
was
to
happen
to
them
next
was
left
entirely
to
the
decision
and
discretion
of
mr
twist
a
man
so
much
worried
that
at
that
moment
he
had
any
of
either
he
could
even
answer
when
asked
where
the
taxi
was
to
go
to
he
had
missed
his
train
and
he
tried
not
to
think
of
his
disappointment
the
thought
was
so
upsetting
but
he
would
have
caught
it
if
he
could
for
how
could
he
leave
these
two
poor
children
i
more
than
ever
convinced
he
said
pushing
his
hat
still
further
off
his
forehead
and
staring
at
the
back
of
the
twinkler
trunks
piled
up
in
front
of
him
next
to
the
driver
while
the
disregarded
official
at
the
door
still
went
on
asking
him
where
he
wished
the
cab
to
go
to
that
children
should
all
have
parents
chapter
xi
the
hotel
they
were
finally
sent
to
by
the
official
goaded
at
last
by
mr
twist
want
of
a
mind
into
independent
instructions
to
the
cabman
was
the
ritz
he
thought
this
very
suitable
for
the
evolver
of
twist
and
it
was
only
when
they
were
being
rushed
along
at
what
the
twins
used
to
the
behaviour
of
london
taxis
and
not
altogether
unacquainted
with
the
prudent
and
deliberation
of
the
taxis
of
berlin
regarded
as
a
speed
that
a
protest
from
conveyed
to
mr
twist
where
they
were
heading
for
an
hotel
called
ritz
sounds
very
expensive
she
said
i
heard
uncle
arthur
talk
of
one
there
is
in
london
and
one
there
is
in
paris
and
he
said
that
only
damned
american
millionaires
could
afford
to
stay
in
them
and
me
are
american
millionaires
or
damned
put
in
but
quite
the
contrary
said
had
you
better
take
us
somewhere
else
somewhere
like
where
the
brontes
stayed
in
london
said
harping
on
this
idea
where
cheapness
is
combined
with
historical
associations
oh
lord
it
do
matter
said
mr
twist
who
for
the
first
time
in
their
friendship
seemed
ruffled
indeed
it
does
said
anxiously
you
forget
we
got
to
husband
our
resources
said
you
must
run
away
with
the
idea
that
because
we
got
the
same
as
millionaires
said
uncle
arthur
said
frequently
told
us
that
is
a
very
vast
sum
but
he
equally
frequently
told
us
that
it
is
it
was
when
he
was
talking
about
having
given
to
us
that
he
said
it
was
such
a
lot
said
he
said
that
as
long
as
we
had
it
we
would
be
rich
said
but
directly
we
had
it
we
would
be
poor
so
we
rather
not
go
to
the
ritz
please
said
if
you
do
mind
the
taxi
was
stopped
and
mr
twist
got
out
and
consulted
the
driver
the
thought
of
his
uncle
charles
as
a
temporary
refuge
for
the
twins
floated
across
his
brain
but
was
rejected
because
uncle
charles
would
speak
to
no
woman
under
fifty
except
from
his
pulpit
and
approached
those
he
did
speak
to
with
caution
till
they
were
sixty
he
regarded
them
as
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
modern
unrest
he
liked
them
so
much
that
he
hated
them
he
could
practise
abstinence
but
not
temperance
uncle
charles
was
no
good
as
a
refuge
well
now
see
here
said
the
driver
at
last
after
mr
twist
had
rejected
such
varied
suggestions
of
something
small
and
quiet
as
the
the
plaza
and
the
biltmore
you
tell
me
where
you
want
to
go
to
and
i
take
you
there
i
want
to
go
to
the
place
your
mother
would
stay
in
if
she
came
up
for
a
day
or
two
from
the
country
said
mr
twist
helplessly
get
right
in
then
and
i
take
you
back
to
the
ritz
said
the
driver
but
finally
when
his
contempt
for
mr
twist
of
whose
identity
he
was
unaware
had
grown
too
great
even
for
him
to
bandy
pleasantries
with
him
he
did
land
his
party
at
an
obscure
hotel
in
a
street
off
the
less
desirable
end
of
fifth
avenue
and
got
rid
of
him
it
was
one
of
those
quiet
and
cheap
new
york
hotels
that
yet
are
both
noisy
and
expensive
it
was
full
of
foreigners
real
foreigners
the
twins
perceived
not
the
merely
technical
sort
like
themselves
but
people
with
yellow
faces
and
black
eyes
they
looked
very
seedy
and
shabby
and
smoked
very
much
and
talked
volubly
in
unknown
tongues
the
entrance
hall
a
place
of
mottled
marble
with
clerks
behind
a
counter
all
of
whose
faces
looked
as
if
they
were
masks
was
thick
with
them
and
it
was
when
they
turned
to
stare
and
whisper
as
passed
and
was
thinking
proudly
yes
you
do
see
anything
like
that
every
day
do
you
and
herself
looked
fondly
at
her
columbus
that
she
saw
that
it
was
columbus
beauty
at
all
but
the
sulphur
on
the
back
of
her
skirt
this
spoilt
arrival
in
new
york
all
the
way
up
in
the
lift
to
the
remote
floor
on
which
their
bedroom
was
she
was
trying
to
brush
it
off
for
the
dress
was
very
best
one
that
all
your
grips
ai
it
said
the
youth
in
buttons
who
had
come
up
with
them
dumping
their
bags
down
on
the
bedroom
floor
our
what
said
to
whom
the
expression
was
new
do
you
mean
our
bags
no
grips
these
here
said
the
youth
is
that
what
they
called
in
america
asked
with
the
intelligent
interest
of
a
traveller
determined
to
understand
and
appreciate
everything
while
still
greatly
upset
by
the
condition
of
the
best
skirt
but
unwilling
to
expatiate
upon
it
before
the
youth
continued
to
brush
her
down
as
best
she
could
with
her
handkerchief
i
do
call
them
it
what
they
are
said
the
youth
what
i
want
to
know
is
are
they
all
here
how
interesting
that
you
do
drop
your
h
said
gazing
at
him
the
rest
of
you
is
so
no
h
the
youth
said
nothing
to
that
the
line
of
thought
being
one
he
follow
those
all
our
grips
i
think
said
counting
them
round
the
corner
of
skirt
thank
you
very
much
she
added
after
a
pause
as
he
still
lingered
but
this
did
cause
him
to
disappear
as
it
would
have
in
england
instead
he
picked
up
a
metal
bottle
with
a
stopper
off
the
table
and
shook
it
and
announced
that
their
bottle
was
empty
want
some
ice
water
he
inquired
what
for
asked
what
for
echoed
the
youth
thank
you
said
who
did
care
about
the
youth
manner
which
seemed
to
her
familiar
we
do
want
ice
water
but
we
should
be
glad
of
a
little
hot
water
you
get
all
you
want
of
that
in
there
said
the
youth
jerking
his
head
towards
a
door
that
led
into
a
bathroom
it
ice
water
and
ink
that
you
get
out
of
me
really
said
gazing
at
him
with
even
more
intelligent
interest
almost
as
if
she
were
prepared
it
being
america
a
country
she
had
heard
of
considerable
mechanical
ingenuity
to
find
his
person
bristling
with
taps
which
only
needed
turning
we
do
want
either
thank
you
said
the
youth
lingered
brushing
began
to
grow
vehement
why
did
he
go
she
did
want
to
have
to
be
rude
to
him
and
hurt
his
feelings
by
asking
him
to
go
but
why
did
he
who
was
much
too
pleasantly
detached
thought
for
such
a
situation
the
door
being
wide
open
to
the
passage
and
the
ungetridable
youth
standing
there
staring
was
leisurely
taking
off
her
hat
and
smoothing
her
hair
suppose
you
new
to
this
country
said
the
youth
after
a
pause
brand
said
pleasantly
then
said
the
youth
you
do
know
that
the
feller
who
brings
up
your
grips
gets
a
tip
of
course
we
know
that
said
standing
up
straight
and
trying
to
look
stately
then
if
you
know
why
do
you
do
it
do
it
she
repeated
endeavouring
to
chill
him
into
respectfulness
by
haughtily
throwing
back
her
head
of
course
we
shall
do
it
at
the
proper
time
and
place
which
is
as
you
must
have
noticed
added
gently
departure
and
the
front
door
that
all
right
said
the
youth
but
that
only
one
of
the
times
and
places
that
the
last
one
where
we
got
to
now
is
the
first
one
do
i
understand
said
trying
to
be
very
dignified
while
her
heart
shrank
within
her
for
what
sort
of
sum
did
one
offer
people
like
this
that
to
america
one
tips
at
the
beginning
as
well
yep
said
the
youth
and
in
the
middle
too
right
along
through
never
miss
an
opportunity
is
as
good
a
slogan
as
you
get
when
it
comes
to
tipping
i
believe
you
have
liked
kipps
said
meditatively
shaking
some
dust
off
her
hat
and
remembering
the
orgy
of
tipping
that
immortal
young
man
went
in
for
at
the
seaside
hotel
what
i
like
now
said
the
youth
growing
more
easy
before
their
manifest
youth
and
ignorance
is
tips
guess
you
can
call
it
kipps
if
it
pleases
you
began
to
fumble
nervously
in
her
purse
it
horrid
i
think
to
ask
for
presents
she
said
to
the
youth
in
deep
humiliation
more
on
his
account
than
hers
presents
i
not
asking
for
presents
i
telling
you
what
done
said
the
youth
and
he
had
spots
on
his
face
and
he
was
repugnant
to
her
gave
him
what
looked
like
a
shilling
he
took
it
and
remarking
that
he
had
had
a
lot
of
trouble
over
it
went
away
and
was
still
flushed
by
this
encounter
when
mr
twist
knocked
and
asked
if
they
were
ready
to
be
taken
down
to
tea
he
might
have
said
thank
you
she
said
indignantly
to
giving
a
final
desperate
brushing
to
the
sulphur
i
expect
he
come
to
a
bad
end
said
soothingly
they
had
tea
in
the
restaurant
and
were
the
only
people
doing
such
a
thing
a
solitary
cluster
in
a
wilderness
of
empty
tables
laid
for
dinner
it
was
the
custom
much
in
america
explained
mr
twist
to
have
tea
and
no
preparations
were
made
for
it
in
hotels
of
that
sort
the
very
waiters
feeling
it
was
a
meal
to
be
discouraged
were
showing
their
detachment
from
it
by
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
room
playing
dominoes
it
was
a
big
room
all
and
windows
and
the
street
outside
was
badly
paved
and
a
great
noise
of
passing
came
in
and
drowned
most
of
what
mr
twist
was
saying
it
was
an
unlovely
place
a
place
in
which
one
might
easily
feel
homesick
and
that
the
world
was
empty
of
affection
if
one
let
oneself
go
that
way
the
twins
would
they
stoutly
refused
in
their
inward
recesses
to
be
daunted
by
these
externals
for
there
was
mr
twist
their
friend
and
still
with
them
and
had
they
got
each
other
but
they
felt
uneasy
all
the
same
for
mr
twist
though
he
plied
them
with
buttered
toast
and
macaroons
and
was
as
attentive
as
usual
had
a
somnambulatory
quality
in
his
attention
he
looked
like
a
man
who
is
doing
things
in
a
dream
he
looked
like
one
who
is
absorbed
in
something
else
his
forehead
still
was
puckered
and
what
could
it
be
puckered
about
seeing
that
he
had
got
home
and
was
going
back
to
his
mother
and
had
a
clear
and
uncomplicated
future
ahead
of
him
and
anyhow
was
a
man
have
you
got
something
on
your
mind
asked
at
last
when
he
had
even
heard
a
question
she
asked
he
the
polite
the
interested
the
sympathetic
friend
of
the
journey
across
mr
twist
sitting
tilted
back
in
his
chair
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
looked
up
from
the
macaroons
he
had
been
staring
at
and
said
yes
tell
us
what
it
is
suggested
you
said
mr
twist
me
both
of
you
you
both
of
you
go
together
you
in
one
lump
in
my
mind
and
on
it
too
finished
mr
twist
ruefully
that
only
because
explained
you
got
the
idea
we
want
such
a
lot
of
taking
care
of
get
rid
of
that
and
you
feel
quite
comfortable
again
why
not
regard
us
merely
as
pleasant
friends
mr
twist
looked
at
her
in
silence
not
as
objects
to
be
protected
continued
anna
felicitas
but
as
of
a
reasonable
soul
and
human
flesh
subsisting
mr
twist
continued
to
look
at
her
in
silence
we
did
come
to
america
to
be
on
anybody
mind
said
supporting
we
had
a
good
deal
of
that
in
england
said
for
instance
we
quite
familiar
with
uncle
arthur
mind
we
were
on
it
so
heavily
and
so
long
it
our
fixed
determination
said
now
that
we
starting
a
new
life
to
get
off
any
mind
we
find
ourselves
on
we
wish
to
carve
out
our
own
destinies
said
we
more
than
wish
to
corrected
we
intend
to
what
were
we
made
in
god
image
for
if
it
was
to
stand
upright
on
our
own
feet
and
i
had
given
this
a
good
deal
of
thought
said
first
and
last
and
we
prepared
to
be
friends
with
everybody
but
only
as
and
of
a
reasonable
soul
and
human
flesh
subsisting
i
do
know
exactly
said
mr
twist
what
that
means
but
it
seems
to
give
you
a
lot
of
satisfaction
it
does
it
out
of
the
athanasian
creed
and
suggests
such
perfect
equality
if
you
regard
us
as
instead
of
as
objects
to
be
looked
after
you
see
how
happy
we
shall
all
be
not
said
growing
tender
for
indeed
in
her
heart
she
loved
and
clung
to
mr
twist
that
we
have
very
much
liked
all
you
done
for
us
and
the
way
you
were
so
kind
to
us
on
the
boat
we
been
obliged
to
you
and
we
shall
miss
you
very
much
indeed
i
know
but
we
get
over
that
of
course
in
time
put
in
and
we
got
to
start
life
now
in
earnest
well
then
said
mr
twist
will
you
two
annas
kindly
tell
me
what
it
is
you
propose
to
do
next
next
after
tea
go
and
look
at
the
sights
i
mean
said
mr
twist
said
we
proceed
to
boston
to
track
the
clouston
sacks
to
their
lair
said
ah
you
made
up
your
minds
to
do
that
they
behaved
abominably
said
mr
twist
perhaps
they
missed
the
train
said
mildly
it
the
proper
course
to
pursue
said
to
proceed
to
boston
i
suppose
it
is
said
mr
twist
again
thinking
that
the
really
proper
and
natural
course
was
for
him
to
have
been
able
to
take
them
to
his
mother
pity
one
mother
was
he
pulled
himself
up
on
the
brink
of
an
unfiliality
he
was
on
the
verge
of
thinking
it
a
pity
one
mother
was
a
different
one
chapter
xii
then
said
mr
twist
if
this
is
all
you
going
to
see
of
new
york
this
one
evening
let
us
go
and
look
at
it
he
beckoned
to
the
waiter
who
came
up
with
the
bill
pulled
out
her
purse
mr
twist
put
up
his
hand
with
severe
determination
you
my
guest
he
said
as
long
as
i
am
with
you
useless
to
protest
young
lady
you
not
get
me
to
belie
my
american
manhood
i
only
listened
with
half
an
ear
to
all
the
things
you
both
said
in
the
taxi
because
i
had
recovered
from
the
surprise
of
finding
myself
still
with
you
instead
of
on
the
train
for
clark
and
because
you
both
of
you
do
say
so
very
many
things
but
understand
once
and
for
all
that
in
this
country
everything
female
has
to
be
paid
for
by
some
man
that
man
till
i
left
you
on
the
sack
doorstep
and
then
it
be
sack
confound
him
finished
mr
twist
suddenly
and
he
silenced
protests
which
persisted
and
were
indignant
by
turning
on
her
with
an
irascibility
she
had
yet
seen
in
him
and
inquiring
of
her
whether
then
she
really
wished
to
put
him
to
public
shame
you
would
wish
to
go
against
an
established
custom
surely
he
said
more
gently
so
the
twins
gave
themselves
up
for
that
one
evening
to
what
called
government
by
wealth
otherwise
plutocracy
while
reserving
complete
freedom
of
action
in
regard
to
sack
who
was
in
their
ignorance
of
his
circumstances
an
unknown
quantity
they
might
be
going
to
be
mothers
helps
in
the
sack
for
all
they
knew
they
might
they
said
be
going
to
be
anything
from
honoured
guests
to
typists
can
you
type
asked
mr
twist
no
said
the
twins
he
took
them
in
a
taxi
to
riverside
drive
and
then
they
walked
down
to
the
charming
footpath
that
runs
along
by
the
hudson
for
three
enchanting
miles
the
sun
had
set
some
time
before
they
got
there
and
had
left
a
clear
pale
yellow
sky
and
a
wonderful
light
on
the
river
lamps
were
being
lit
and
hung
like
silver
globes
in
the
thin
air
steep
grass
slopes
and
groups
of
big
trees
a
little
deeper
yellow
than
the
sky
hid
that
there
were
houses
and
a
street
above
them
on
their
right
up
and
down
the
river
steamers
passed
pierced
with
light
their
delicate
smoke
hanging
in
the
air
long
after
they
had
gone
their
way
it
was
so
great
a
joy
to
walk
in
all
this
after
ten
days
shut
up
on
the
and
to
see
such
blessed
things
as
grass
and
leaves
again
that
the
twins
felt
suddenly
extraordinarily
brisked
up
and
cheerful
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
cheerful
translated
from
the
into
such
a
place
trotting
along
in
the
peculiar
dry
air
that
made
one
all
tingly
the
world
seemed
suddenly
quite
good
the
simplest
easiest
of
objects
to
tackle
all
one
had
to
do
was
not
to
let
it
weigh
on
one
to
laugh
rather
than
cry
they
trotted
along
humming
bits
of
their
songs
feeling
very
warm
and
happy
inside
felicitously
full
of
tea
and
macaroons
and
with
their
feet
comfortably
on
something
that
kept
still
and
did
heave
or
lurch
beneath
them
mr
twist
too
was
gayer
than
he
had
been
for
some
hours
he
seemed
relieved
and
he
was
he
had
sent
a
telegram
to
his
mother
expressing
proper
sorrow
at
being
detained
in
new
york
but
giving
no
reason
for
it
and
promising
he
would
be
with
her
rather
late
the
next
evening
and
he
had
sent
a
telegram
to
the
clouston
sacks
saying
the
twinklers
who
had
so
unfortunately
missed
them
in
new
york
would
arrive
in
boston
early
next
afternoon
his
mind
was
clear
again
owing
to
the
determination
of
the
twins
to
go
to
the
sacks
he
was
going
to
take
them
there
hand
them
over
and
then
go
back
to
clark
which
fortunately
was
only
three
hours
journey
from
boston
if
the
twins
had
shown
a
disinclination
to
go
after
the
sacks
who
in
mr
twist
opinion
had
behaved
shamefully
already
he
would
have
had
the
heart
to
press
them
to
go
and
then
what
would
he
have
done
with
them
their
second
and
last
line
of
defence
supposing
they
had
considered
the
sacks
had
failed
and
were
to
be
ruled
out
was
in
california
a
place
they
spoke
of
as
if
it
were
next
door
to
boston
and
new
york
how
could
he
have
let
them
set
out
alone
on
that
four
journey
with
the
possibility
of
once
more
at
its
end
not
being
met
no
wonder
he
had
been
abstracted
at
tea
he
was
relieved
to
the
extent
of
his
forehead
going
quite
smooth
again
at
their
decision
to
proceed
to
the
sacks
for
he
could
have
taken
them
to
his
mother
without
preparation
and
explanation
and
he
could
have
left
them
in
new
york
while
he
went
and
prepared
and
explained
great
reflected
mr
twist
the
verb
dropping
into
his
mind
with
the
of
an
inspiration
are
the
difficulties
that
beset
a
man
directly
he
begins
to
twinkle
already
he
had
earnestly
wished
to
knock
the
reception
clerk
in
the
hotel
office
down
because
of
first
his
obvious
suspicion
of
the
party
before
he
had
heard
mr
twist
name
and
because
of
second
his
politeness
his
confidential
manner
as
of
an
understanding
sympathizer
with
a
rich
recreations
when
he
had
the
tea
which
he
had
poured
out
of
one
of
his
own
teapots
had
been
completely
spoilt
by
the
knowledge
that
it
was
only
this
teapot
that
had
saved
him
from
being
treated
as
a
white
slave
trafficker
he
would
have
got
into
that
hotel
at
all
with
the
twinklers
or
into
any
other
decent
one
except
for
his
teapot
what
a
country
mr
twist
had
thought
fresh
from
his
work
in
france
fresh
from
where
people
were
profoundly
occupied
with
the
great
business
of
surviving
at
all
here
he
came
back
from
a
place
where
civilization
toppled
where
deadly
misery
deadly
bravery
heroism
that
could
be
uttered
staggered
month
after
month
among
ruins
and
found
america
untouched
comfortable
fat
still
with
time
to
worry
over
the
suspected
amorousness
of
the
rich
still
putting
people
into
uniforms
in
order
to
buttonhole
a
man
on
landing
and
him
as
to
his
private
purities
he
had
been
much
annoyed
but
he
too
could
resist
the
extreme
pleasure
of
real
exercise
on
such
a
lovely
evening
nor
could
he
resist
the
infection
of
the
cheerfulness
of
the
twinklers
they
walked
along
talking
and
laughing
and
seeming
to
walk
much
faster
than
he
did
especially
who
had
to
break
into
a
run
every
few
steps
because
of
his
so
much
longer
legs
his
face
restored
to
all
its
usual
kindliness
as
he
listened
benevolently
to
their
remarks
and
just
when
they
were
beginning
to
feel
as
if
they
soon
might
be
tired
and
hungry
a
restaurant
with
gardens
appeared
as
punctually
as
if
they
had
been
in
germany
that
land
of
nicely
arranged
distances
between
meals
they
had
an
extremely
cheerful
little
supper
out
of
doors
with
things
to
eat
that
thrilled
the
twinklers
in
their
delicious
strangeness
heavenly
food
they
thought
it
after
the
rigours
of
the
cooking
on
the
and
the
biggest
ices
they
had
seen
in
their
lives
great
dollops
of
pink
and
yellow
divineness
then
mr
twist
took
them
in
a
taxi
to
look
at
the
illuminated
advertisements
in
broadway
and
they
forgot
everything
but
the
joy
of
the
moment
whatever
the
next
day
held
this
evening
was
sheer
happiness
their
eyes
shone
and
their
cheeks
flushed
and
mr
twist
was
quite
worried
that
they
were
so
pretty
people
at
the
other
tables
at
the
restaurant
had
stared
at
them
with
frank
admiration
and
so
did
the
people
in
the
streets
whenever
the
taxi
was
blocked
on
the
ship
he
had
only
sometimes
been
aware
of
it
there
would
come
a
glint
of
sunshine
and
settle
on
little
cheek
where
the
dimple
was
or
he
would
lift
his
eyes
from
the
culture
book
and
suddenly
see
the
dark
softness
of
eyelashes
as
she
slept
in
her
chair
but
now
dressed
properly
and
in
their
dryland
condition
of
cheerful
animation
he
perceived
that
they
were
very
pretty
indeed
and
that
was
more
than
very
pretty
he
could
help
thinking
they
were
a
most
unsuitable
couple
to
be
let
loose
in
america
with
only
two
hundred
pounds
to
support
them
two
hundred
pounds
was
just
enough
to
let
them
slip
about
if
it
should
enter
their
heads
to
slip
about
go
off
without
explanation
for
instance
if
they
wanted
to
leave
the
clouston
sacks
but
of
course
ridiculous
as
a
serious
background
to
life
a
girl
should
either
have
enough
money
or
be
completely
dependent
on
her
male
relations
as
a
girl
was
usually
young
reflected
mr
twist
his
spectacles
with
the
broadway
lights
in
them
blazing
on
the
two
specimens
opposite
him
it
was
safest
for
her
to
be
dependent
so
were
her
actions
controlled
and
kept
within
the
bounds
of
wisdom
and
next
morning
as
he
sat
waiting
for
the
twins
for
breakfast
at
ten
according
to
arrangement
the
night
before
their
in
little
beds
of
ice
on
their
plates
and
every
sort
of
american
dish
ordered
from
griddle
cakes
and
molasses
to
chicken
pie
a
page
came
in
with
loud
cries
for
mr
twist
which
made
him
instantly
conspicuous
a
thing
he
particularly
disliked
and
handed
him
a
letter
the
twins
had
gone
chapter
xiii
they
had
left
early
that
morning
for
boston
determined
as
they
wrote
no
longer
to
trespass
on
his
kindness
there
had
been
a
discussion
in
their
bedroom
the
night
before
when
they
got
back
in
which
supplied
the
heat
and
the
arguments
and
it
ended
in
succeeding
in
restoring
to
her
original
standpoint
of
proud
independence
from
which
lured
by
the
comfort
and
security
of
mr
twist
companionship
she
had
been
inclined
to
slip
it
took
some
time
because
of
being
the
eldest
had
had
to
be
as
wary
and
gentle
and
persistently
affectionate
as
a
wife
whom
necessity
compels
to
try
and
get
reason
into
her
husband
feathers
even
as
the
feathers
of
a
husband
bristled
at
the
mere
breath
of
criticism
of
her
superior
intelligence
and
wisdom
she
was
the
leader
of
the
party
the
head
and
guide
the
one
who
had
the
dollars
in
her
pocket
and
being
the
eldest
naturally
must
know
best
besides
she
was
secretly
nervous
about
taking
about
alone
she
too
had
observed
the
stares
of
the
public
and
had
never
supposed
that
any
of
them
might
be
for
her
how
was
she
to
get
to
boston
successfully
with
so
enchanting
a
creature
through
all
the
complications
of
travel
in
an
unknown
country
without
the
support
and
counsel
of
mr
twist
just
the
dollars
and
quarters
and
dimes
and
cents
cowed
her
the
strangeness
of
everything
while
it
delighted
her
so
long
as
she
could
peep
at
it
from
behind
mr
twist
appalled
her
the
minute
she
was
left
alone
with
it
america
seemed
altogether
a
foreign
country
a
strange
place
whose
inhabitants
by
accident
did
talk
in
a
strange
language
they
talked
english
or
rather
what
sounded
like
english
till
you
found
that
it
was
really
but
prevailed
she
had
all
inborn
horror
of
accepting
money
or
other
benefits
from
people
who
had
no
natural
right
to
exercise
their
benevolences
upon
her
to
appeal
to
christopher
after
long
wrestling
restored
at
last
to
pride
did
sit
down
and
write
the
letter
that
so
much
spoilt
mr
twist
breakfast
next
morning
while
columbus
slouched
about
the
room
suggesting
sentences
it
was
a
letter
profuse
in
thanks
for
all
mr
twist
had
done
for
them
and
couched
in
language
that
betrayed
the
particular
share
had
taken
in
the
plan
for
though
they
both
loved
long
words
were
always
a
little
the
longer
in
rolling
sentences
that
made
mr
twist
laugh
in
spite
of
his
concern
they
pointed
out
that
his
first
duty
was
to
his
mother
and
his
second
was
not
to
squander
his
possessions
in
paying
the
hotel
and
railway
bills
of
persons
who
had
no
sort
of
claim
on
him
except
those
general
claims
of
humanity
which
he
had
already
on
the
so
amply
discharged
they
would
refrain
from
paying
their
hotel
bill
remembering
his
words
as
to
the
custom
of
the
country
though
their
instincts
were
altogether
against
this
course
but
they
could
and
would
avoid
causing
him
the
further
expense
and
trouble
and
waste
of
his
no
doubt
valuable
time
of
taking
them
to
boston
by
the
simple
process
of
going
there
without
him
they
promised
to
write
from
the
sacks
and
let
him
know
of
their
arrival
to
the
address
at
clark
he
had
given
them
and
they
would
never
forget
him
as
long
as
they
lived
and
remained
his
very
sincerely
and
twinkler
mr
twist
hurried
out
to
the
office
the
clerk
who
had
been
so
confidential
in
his
manner
the
evening
before
looked
at
him
curiously
yes
the
young
ladies
had
left
on
the
for
boston
they
had
come
downstairs
baggage
and
all
at
seven
had
asked
for
a
taxi
had
said
they
wished
to
go
to
boston
inquired
about
the
station
and
had
specially
requested
that
mr
twist
should
not
be
disturbed
they
seemed
in
a
slight
hurry
to
be
off
said
the
clerk
and
like
there
being
no
train
before
the
i
thought
you
knew
all
about
it
mr
twist
he
added
inquisitively
so
i
did
so
i
did
said
mr
twist
turning
away
to
go
back
to
his
breakfast
for
three
so
he
did
so
he
did
muttered
the
clerk
with
a
wink
to
the
other
clerk
and
for
a
few
minutes
they
whispered
judging
from
the
expressions
on
their
faces
what
appeared
to
be
very
exciting
things
to
each
other
meanwhile
the
twins
after
a
brief
struggle
of
extraordinary
intensity
at
the
station
in
getting
their
tickets
trying
to
understand
the
black
man
who
seized
and
dealt
with
their
luggage
and
closely
following
him
wherever
he
went
in
case
he
should
disappear
were
sitting
in
a
state
of
relaxation
and
relief
in
the
boston
express
their
troubles
over
for
at
least
several
hours
the
black
porter
whose
heart
happened
not
to
be
black
and
who
had
children
of
his
own
perceived
the
helpless
ignorance
that
lay
behind
the
twins
assumption
a
of
severe
dignity
and
took
them
in
hand
and
got
seats
for
them
in
the
parlour
car
as
they
knew
nothing
about
cars
parlour
or
otherwise
but
had
merely
and
quite
uselessly
reiterated
to
the
till
their
porter
intervened
that
they
wanted
tickets
they
accepted
these
seats
thankful
in
the
press
and
noise
round
them
to
get
anything
so
roomy
and
calm
as
these
dignified
and
it
was
till
they
had
been
in
them
some
time
their
feet
on
green
footstools
with
attendants
offering
them
fruit
and
chocolates
and
magazines
at
intervals
just
as
if
they
had
been
in
heaven
as
remarked
admiringly
that
counting
their
money
they
discovered
what
a
hole
the
journey
had
made
in
it
but
they
were
too
much
relieved
at
having
accomplished
so
much
on
their
own
quite
uphelped
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
aunt
alice
to
take
it
particularly
to
heart
and
as
said
there
was
still
the
and
as
said
it
was
likely
they
go
in
a
train
again
for
ages
and
anyhow
as
said
whatever
it
had
cost
they
were
bound
to
get
away
from
being
constant
drains
on
mr
purse
the
train
journey
delighted
them
to
sit
so
comfortably
and
privately
in
chairs
that
twisted
round
so
that
if
a
passenger
should
start
staring
at
one
could
make
her
turn
her
back
altogether
on
him
to
have
one
feet
on
footstools
when
they
were
the
sort
of
feet
that
reach
the
ground
to
see
the
lovely
autumn
country
flying
past
hills
and
woods
and
fields
and
gardens
golden
in
the
october
sun
while
the
horrible
atlantic
was
nowhere
in
sight
to
pass
through
towns
so
queerly
reminiscent
of
english
and
german
towns
shaken
up
together
and
yet
not
a
bit
like
either
to
be
able
to
have
the
window
wide
open
without
getting
soot
in
one
eyes
because
one
of
the
ministering
angels
clad
this
one
appropriately
to
heaven
in
white
though
otherwise
black
pulled
up
the
same
sort
of
wire
screen
they
used
to
have
in
the
windows
at
home
to
keep
out
the
mosquitoes
to
imitate
about
twelve
when
they
grew
bold
because
they
were
so
hungry
the
other
passengers
and
cause
the
black
angel
to
spread
a
little
table
between
them
and
bring
clam
broth
which
they
ordered
in
a
spirit
of
adventure
and
curiosity
and
concealed
from
each
other
that
they
did
like
to
have
the
young
man
who
passed
up
and
down
with
the
candy
and
whose
mouth
was
full
of
it
grow
so
friendly
that
he
offered
them
toffee
from
his
own
private
supply
at
last
when
they
had
refused
regretfully
a
dozen
suggestions
to
buy
have
a
bit
he
said
thrusting
it
under
their
noses
as
a
gentleman
to
ladies
no
pecuniary
obligations
come
on
now
all
this
was
to
the
twins
too
interesting
and
delightful
for
words
they
accepted
the
toffee
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
offered
and
since
nobody
can
eat
somebody
toffee
without
being
pleasant
in
return
intermittent
amenities
passed
between
them
and
the
young
man
as
he
journeyed
up
and
down
through
the
cars
first
visit
to
the
states
he
inquired
when
with
some
reluctance
for
presently
it
appeared
to
the
twins
that
the
clam
broth
and
the
toffee
did
seem
to
be
liking
each
other
now
they
had
got
together
inside
them
and
also
for
fear
of
hurting
his
feelings
if
they
refused
they
took
some
more
they
nodded
and
smiled
stickily
english
i
guess
they
hesitated
covering
their
hesitation
with
the
earnest
working
of
their
jaws
then
her
cheek
distorted
gave
him
the
answer
she
had
given
the
captain
of
the
luke
and
said
practically
ah
said
the
young
man
turning
this
over
in
his
mind
the
r
in
practically
having
rolled
as
no
english
or
american
r
ever
did
but
the
conductor
appearing
in
the
doorway
he
continued
on
his
way
it
evident
said
speaking
with
difficulty
for
her
jaws
clave
together
because
of
the
toffee
that
we
going
to
be
asked
that
the
first
thing
every
time
a
fresh
person
speaks
to
us
we
better
decide
what
we
going
to
say
and
practise
saying
it
without
hesitation
made
a
sound
of
assent
that
answer
of
yours
about
practically
continued
swallowing
her
bit
of
toffee
by
accident
and
for
one
moment
afraid
it
would
stick
somewhere
and
make
her
die
causes
first
surprise
then
reflection
and
then
suspicion
but
said
after
a
pause
during
which
she
had
disentangled
her
jaws
it
going
to
be
difficult
to
say
one
is
german
when
america
seems
to
be
so
very
neutral
and
does
like
germans
besides
it
only
in
the
eye
of
the
law
that
we
are
in
god
eye
not
and
that
the
principal
eye
after
all
her
own
eyes
grew
thoughtful
i
do
believe
she
said
that
parents
when
they
marry
have
any
idea
of
all
the
difficulties
they
going
to
place
their
children
in
i
do
believe
they
think
about
it
at
all
said
i
mean
she
added
quickly
lest
she
should
be
supposed
to
be
questioning
the
perfect
love
and
forethought
of
their
mother
fathers
do
they
were
silent
a
little
after
this
each
thinking
things
tinged
to
sobriety
by
the
effect
of
the
inner
conflict
going
on
between
the
clam
broth
and
the
toffee
also
boston
was
rushing
towards
them
and
the
clouston
sacks
quite
soon
they
would
have
to
leave
the
peaceful
security
of
the
train
and
begin
to
be
active
again
and
quick
and
clever
who
was
slow
found
it
difficult
ever
to
be
clever
till
about
the
week
after
and
who
was
impetuous
was
so
impetuous
that
she
entirely
outstripped
her
scanty
store
of
cleverness
and
landed
panting
and
surprised
in
situations
she
had
an
idea
what
to
do
with
the
clouston
sacks
now
aunt
alice
had
said
you
must
take
care
to
be
very
tactful
with
and
clouston
sack
and
when
her
forehead
as
much
puckered
as
mr
twist
in
her
desire
to
get
exactly
at
what
tactful
was
in
order
to
be
able
diligently
to
be
it
asked
for
definitions
aunt
alice
only
said
it
was
what
gentlewomen
were
instinctively
then
observed
when
on
nearing
boston
repeated
aunt
alice
admonishment
and
at
the
same
time
provided
for
her
guidance
with
the
definition
seeing
that
supposed
to
be
gentlewomen
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
behave
according
to
our
instincts
but
was
sure
she
doubted
their
instincts
especially
she
thought
her
own
were
better
being
older
but
even
hers
were
extraordinarily
apt
to
develop
in
unexpected
directions
according
to
the
other
person
behaviour
her
instinct
for
instance
when
engaged
by
uncle
arthur
in
conversation
had
usually
been
to
hit
him
was
that
tact
yet
she
knew
she
was
a
gentlewoman
she
had
heard
that
since
first
she
had
heard
words
at
all
from
every
servant
teacher
visitor
and
relation
except
her
mother
in
her
prussian
home
indeed
over
there
she
had
been
told
she
was
more
than
a
gentlewoman
for
she
was
a
noblewoman
and
therefore
her
instincts
ought
positively
to
drip
tact
dodson
aunt
alice
had
said
one
afternoon
towards
the
end
when
the
twins
came
in
from
a
walk
and
found
the
rector
having
tea
says
that
you
ca
be
too
tactful
in
america
he
been
there
sensitive
sensitive
said
dodson
shaking
his
head
at
his
cup
splendidly
sensitive
just
as
they
are
splendidly
whatever
else
they
are
a
great
country
everything
on
a
vast
scale
including
sensitiveness
it
has
to
be
met
vastly
but
quite
easy
really
he
raised
a
pedagogic
finger
at
the
twins
you
merely
add
half
as
much
again
to
the
quantity
of
your
tact
as
the
quantity
you
encounter
of
their
sensitiveness
and
it
all
right
be
sure
you
remember
that
now
said
aunt
alice
pleased
as
boston
got
nearer
trying
to
learn
dodson
recipe
for
social
success
by
heart
became
more
silent
on
the
ship
when
the
meeting
with
the
sacks
was
imminent
she
had
fled
in
sudden
panic
to
her
cabin
to
hide
from
them
that
could
have
been
tact
but
it
was
instinct
and
she
was
a
gentlewoman
now
once
again
dread
took
possession
of
her
and
she
wanted
to
hide
not
to
get
there
to
stay
in
the
train
and
go
on
and
on
she
said
nothing
of
course
of
her
dread
to
in
order
not
to
undermine
that
young
person
but
she
did
very
much
wish
that
principles
were
such
important
things
and
one
need
have
cut
oneself
off
from
the
protecting
figure
of
mr
twist
now
remember
what
aunt
alice
said
she
whispered
severely
to
gripping
her
arm
as
they
stood
jammed
in
the
narrow
passage
to
the
door
waiting
to
be
let
out
at
boston
on
the
platform
they
both
thought
would
be
the
sacks
certainly
one
sack
and
they
had
feverishly
made
themselves
tidy
and
composed
their
faces
into
pleasant
smiles
preparatory
to
the
meeting
but
once
again
no
sacks
were
there
the
platform
emptied
itself
just
as
the
great
hall
of
the
had
emptied
itself
and
nobody
came
to
claim
the
twinklers
these
sacks
remarked
patiently
at
last
when
it
was
finally
plain
that
there
were
any
do
seem
to
have
acquired
the
meeting
habit
no
said
vexed
but
relieved
they
like
what
aunt
alice
used
to
complain
about
the
housemaids
neither
punctual
nor
methodical
but
it
does
matter
said
they
shall
not
escape
us
i
getting
quite
hungry
for
the
sacks
as
a
result
of
not
having
them
we
will
now
proceed
to
track
them
to
their
lair
for
one
instant
looked
longingly
at
the
train
it
was
still
there
it
was
going
on
further
and
further
away
from
the
sacks
happy
train
one
little
jump
and
they
be
in
it
again
but
she
resisted
and
engaged
a
porter
even
as
soon
as
this
the
twins
were
far
less
helpless
than
they
had
been
the
day
before
the
sack
address
was
in
hand
and
they
knew
what
an
american
porter
looked
like
the
porter
and
a
taxi
were
engaged
with
comparative
ease
and
assurance
and
on
giving
the
porter
who
had
staggered
beneath
the
number
of
their
grips
a
dime
and
seeing
a
cloud
on
his
face
they
doubled
it
instantly
sooner
than
have
trouble
and
trebled
it
equally
quickly
on
his
displaying
yet
further
dissatisfaction
and
they
departed
for
the
sacks
their
grips
piled
up
round
them
in
the
taxi
as
far
as
their
chins
congratulating
themselves
on
how
much
easier
it
was
to
get
away
from
a
train
than
to
get
into
one
but
the
minute
their
activities
were
over
and
they
had
time
to
think
silence
fell
upon
them
again
they
were
both
nervous
they
both
composed
their
faces
to
indifference
to
hide
that
they
were
nervous
examining
the
streets
they
passed
through
with
a
calm
and
stare
worthy
of
a
lorgnette
it
was
the
tact
part
of
the
coming
encounter
that
was
chiefly
unnerving
and
was
dejected
by
her
conviction
that
nobody
who
was
a
friend
of
uncle
arthur
could
possibly
be
agreeable
by
their
friends
ye
shall
know
them
thought
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
boston
buildings
also
the
persistence
of
the
sacks
in
not
being
on
piers
and
railway
stations
was
discouraging
there
was
no
eagerness
about
this
persistence
there
was
even
friendliness
perhaps
they
did
like
her
and
being
german
this
was
always
the
twins
first
thought
when
anybody
particularly
cordial
their
experiences
in
england
had
made
them
a
little
jumpy
they
were
conscious
of
this
weak
spot
and
like
a
hurt
finger
it
seemed
always
to
be
getting
in
the
way
and
being
knocked
once
more
pondered
on
the
inscrutable
behaviour
of
providence
which
had
led
their
mother
so
safely
and
admirably
english
to
leave
that
blessed
shelter
and
go
and
marry
somebody
who
was
of
course
there
was
this
to
be
said
for
it
that
she
was
their
mother
then
if
she
had
been
felt
sure
she
would
have
then
perceiving
that
her
thoughts
were
getting
difficult
to
follow
she
gave
them
up
and
slid
her
hand
through
arm
and
gave
it
a
squeeze
now
for
the
new
world
christopher
she
said
pretending
to
be
very
eager
and
brave
and
like
the
real
columbus
as
the
taxi
stopped
chapter
xiv
the
taxi
had
stopped
in
front
of
a
handsome
apartment
house
and
almost
before
it
was
quiet
a
boy
in
buttons
darted
out
across
the
intervening
wide
pavement
and
thrust
his
face
through
the
window
who
do
you
want
he
said
or
rather
jerked
out
he
then
saw
the
contents
of
the
taxi
and
his
mouth
fell
open
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
grips
and
passengers
were
piled
up
inside
it
in
a
seething
mass
we
want
and
clouston
sack
said
in
her
most
voice
they
expecting
us
they
ai
said
the
boy
promptly
they
ai
repeated
echoing
his
language
in
her
surprise
how
do
you
know
asked
that
they
ai
because
they
ai
said
the
boy
i
bet
you
my
sunday
shirt
they
ai
the
twins
stared
at
him
they
were
not
accustomed
in
their
conversations
with
the
lower
classes
to
be
talked
to
about
shirts
the
boy
seemed
extraordinarily
vital
his
speech
was
so
quick
that
it
flew
out
with
the
urgency
and
haste
of
squibs
going
off
please
open
the
door
said
recovering
herself
we
go
up
and
see
for
ourselves
you
wo
see
said
the
boy
kindly
open
the
door
repeated
you
wo
see
he
said
pulling
it
open
but
you
can
look
if
you
do
see
sacks
up
there
i
a
hun
the
minute
the
door
opened
grips
fell
out
there
were
two
umbrellas
two
coats
a
knapsack
of
a
disreputable
bulged
appearance
repugnant
to
american
ideas
of
baggage
which
run
on
big
simple
lines
of
huge
trunks
an
case
a
suit
case
a
a
basket
and
a
outside
beside
the
driver
were
two
such
small
and
modest
trunks
that
they
might
almost
as
well
have
been
grips
themselves
do
you
mind
taking
those
in
asked
getting
out
with
difficulty
over
the
umbrella
that
had
fallen
across
the
doorway
and
pointing
to
the
gutter
in
which
the
other
umbrella
and
the
knapsack
lay
and
into
which
the
basket
now
that
her
body
no
longer
kept
it
in
was
rolling
in
where
crackled
the
boy
in
said
severely
in
to
wherever
and
clouston
sack
are
it
no
good
your
saying
they
are
when
they
ai
said
the
boy
increasing
the
loudness
of
his
crackling
do
you
mean
they
do
live
here
asked
in
her
turn
disentangling
herself
from
that
which
was
still
inside
the
taxi
and
immediately
followed
on
to
the
pavement
by
the
and
the
case
they
did
live
here
till
yesterday
said
the
boy
but
now
they
do
one
does
but
that
not
the
same
as
two
which
is
what
i
meant
when
you
said
they
expecting
you
and
i
said
they
ai
do
you
mean
to
say
stopped
with
a
catch
of
her
breath
do
you
mean
she
went
on
in
an
voice
that
one
of
them
one
of
them
is
dead
dead
bless
you
no
anything
but
dead
the
exact
opposite
gone
left
got
said
the
boy
oh
said
greatly
relieved
passing
over
his
last
word
whose
meaning
escaped
her
oh
you
mean
just
gone
to
meet
us
and
missed
us
you
see
she
said
turning
to
they
did
try
to
after
all
said
nothing
but
reflected
that
whichever
sack
had
tried
to
must
have
a
quite
unusual
gift
for
missing
people
gone
to
meet
you
repeated
the
boy
as
one
surprised
by
a
new
point
of
view
well
i
do
know
about
that
we
go
up
and
explain
said
is
it
or
clouston
sack
who
is
here
said
the
boy
very
well
then
please
bring
in
our
things
and
proceeded
followed
by
to
walk
into
the
house
the
boy
instead
of
bringing
them
in
picked
up
the
articles
lying
on
the
pavement
and
put
them
back
again
into
the
taxi
no
hurry
about
them
i
guess
he
said
to
the
driver
time
enough
to
take
them
up
when
the
gurls
ask
again
and
he
darted
after
the
gurls
to
hand
them
over
to
his
colleague
who
worked
what
he
called
the
elevator
why
do
you
call
it
the
elevator
inquired
mildly
inquisitive
of
this
boy
who
on
hearing
that
they
wished
to
see
sack
stared
at
them
with
profound
and
unblinking
interest
all
the
way
up
when
it
is
really
a
lift
because
it
is
an
elevator
said
the
boy
briefly
but
we
you
see
said
are
equally
convinced
that
a
lift
the
boy
did
answer
this
he
was
as
silent
as
the
other
one
was
but
there
was
a
thrill
about
him
too
something
electric
and
tense
he
stared
at
then
turned
quickly
and
stared
at
then
quickly
back
to
and
so
on
all
the
way
up
he
was
obviously
extraordinarily
interested
he
seemed
to
have
got
hold
of
an
idea
that
had
not
struck
the
boy
downstairs
who
was
entertaining
the
with
descriptions
of
the
domestic
life
of
the
sacks
the
lift
stopped
at
what
the
twins
supposed
was
going
to
be
the
door
of
a
landing
or
public
corridor
but
it
was
they
discovered
the
actual
door
of
the
sack
flat
at
any
moment
the
sacks
if
they
wished
to
commit
suicide
could
do
so
simply
by
stepping
out
of
their
own
front
door
they
would
then
fall
infinitely
far
on
to
the
roof
of
the
lift
lurking
at
the
bottom
the
pressed
a
bell
the
door
opened
and
there
at
once
exposed
to
the
twins
was
the
square
hall
of
the
sack
flat
with
a
manservant
standing
in
it
staring
at
them
obsessed
by
his
idea
the
immediately
stepped
out
of
his
lift
approached
the
servant
introduced
his
passengers
to
him
by
saying
young
ladies
to
see
sack
took
a
step
closer
and
whispered
in
his
ear
but
perfectly
audibly
to
the
twins
who
however
regarded
it
as
some
expression
peculiarly
american
and
were
left
unmoved
by
it
the
the
servant
stared
uncertainly
at
them
his
mistress
had
only
been
gone
a
few
hours
and
the
flat
was
still
warm
with
her
presence
and
authority
she
would
he
well
knew
have
permitted
to
be
about
the
place
if
she
had
been
there
but
on
the
other
hand
she
was
there
sack
was
in
sole
possession
now
nobody
knew
where
sack
was
letters
and
telegrams
lay
on
the
table
for
her
unopened
among
them
mr
twist
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
twinklers
in
his
heart
the
servant
sided
with
sack
but
only
in
his
heart
for
the
servant
wife
was
the
cook
and
she
as
she
frequently
explained
was
all
for
strict
monogamy
he
stared
therefore
uncertainly
at
the
twins
his
brain
revolving
round
their
colossal
impudence
in
coming
there
before
sack
rooms
had
so
much
as
had
time
to
get
as
it
were
cold
we
want
to
see
clouston
sack
began
in
her
clear
little
voice
and
no
sooner
did
she
begin
to
speak
than
a
door
was
pulled
open
and
the
gentleman
himself
appeared
i
heard
a
noise
of
arrival
he
said
stopping
suddenly
when
he
saw
them
i
heard
a
noise
of
arrival
and
a
woman
voice
it
us
said
her
face
covering
itself
with
the
bright
conciliatory
smiles
of
the
arriving
guest
are
you
clouston
sack
she
went
up
to
him
and
held
out
her
hand
they
both
went
up
to
him
and
held
out
their
hands
we
the
twinklers
said
we
come
said
in
case
he
should
have
noticed
it
sack
let
his
hand
be
shaken
and
it
was
a
moist
hand
he
looked
like
a
gibson
young
man
who
has
grown
elderly
he
had
the
manly
profile
and
shoulders
but
they
sagged
and
stooped
there
was
a
dilapidation
about
him
a
look
of
blurred
edges
his
hair
lay
on
his
forehead
in
disorder
and
his
tie
had
been
put
on
carelessly
and
had
wriggled
up
to
the
rim
of
his
collar
the
twinklers
he
repeated
the
twinklers
do
i
remember
i
wonder
there
has
been
much
time
to
forget
said
less
than
two
months
since
there
were
all
those
letters
letters
echoed
sack
letters
so
now
we
got
here
said
the
more
brightly
that
she
was
unnerved
yes
we
come
said
also
with
feverish
brightness
bewildered
sack
who
felt
that
he
had
had
enough
to
bear
the
last
few
hours
stood
staring
at
them
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
lingering
and
he
further
saw
the
expression
on
his
servant
face
even
to
his
bewilderment
it
was
clear
what
he
was
thinking
sack
turned
round
quickly
and
led
the
way
into
the
come
in
come
in
he
said
distractedly
they
went
in
he
shut
the
door
the
and
the
servant
lingered
a
moment
making
faces
at
each
other
then
the
dropped
away
in
his
lift
and
the
servant
retired
to
the
kitchen
i
darned
was
all
he
could
articulate
i
darned
there
our
luggage
said
turning
to
sack
on
getting
inside
the
room
her
voice
gone
a
little
shrill
in
her
determined
cheerfulness
can
it
be
brought
up
luggage
repeated
sack
putting
his
hand
to
his
forehead
excuse
me
but
i
got
such
a
racking
headache
it
makes
me
stupid
oh
i
sorry
said
solicitously
and
so
am
i
said
equally
solicitous
have
you
tried
aspirin
sometimes
some
simple
remedy
like
that
oh
thank
you
it
good
of
you
it
good
of
you
the
effect
you
see
is
that
i
ca
think
very
clearly
but
do
tell
me
why
luggage
luggage
luggage
you
mean
i
suppose
baggage
why
luggage
asked
nervously
is
there
is
there
always
luggage
in
america
too
when
people
come
to
stay
with
one
you
come
to
stay
with
me
said
sack
putting
his
hand
to
his
forehead
again
you
see
said
we
the
twinklers
yes
yes
i
know
you
told
me
that
so
naturally
we
come
but
it
natural
asked
sack
looking
at
them
distractedly
we
sent
you
a
telegram
said
or
rather
one
to
sack
which
is
the
same
thing
it
is
it
is
said
the
distressed
sack
i
wish
it
were
it
ought
to
be
sack
is
here
yes
we
very
sorry
to
have
missed
her
did
she
go
to
meet
us
in
new
york
or
where
sack
did
go
to
meet
you
she
gone
gone
where
oh
cried
sack
somewhere
else
but
not
to
meet
you
oh
he
went
on
after
a
moment
in
which
while
the
twins
gazed
at
him
he
fought
with
and
overcame
emotion
when
i
heard
you
speaking
in
the
hall
i
thought
i
had
a
moment
hope
for
a
minute
i
believed
she
had
come
back
so
i
went
out
else
i
could
have
seen
you
i
not
fit
to
see
strangers
the
things
sack
said
and
his
fluttering
unhappy
voice
were
so
much
at
variance
with
the
stern
lines
of
his
gibson
profile
that
the
twins
viewed
him
with
the
utmost
surprise
they
came
to
no
conclusion
and
passed
no
judgment
because
they
did
know
but
what
if
one
was
an
american
one
naturally
behaved
like
that
i
do
think
said
gently
that
you
can
call
us
strangers
we
the
twinklers
yes
yes
i
know
you
keep
on
telling
me
that
said
sack
but
i
ca
call
to
mind
do
you
remember
all
uncle
arthur
letters
about
us
we
the
nieces
he
asked
you
to
be
kind
to
for
a
bit
as
i
sure
added
politely
you
admirably
adapted
for
being
sack
turned
his
bewildered
eyes
on
to
her
oh
are
you
a
pretty
girl
he
said
in
the
same
distressed
voice
you
must
make
her
vain
said
trying
not
to
smile
all
over
her
face
while
remained
as
manifestly
unvain
as
a
person
intent
on
something
else
would
be
we
know
you
got
uncle
arthur
letters
about
us
she
continued
because
he
showed
us
your
answers
back
you
invited
us
to
come
and
stay
with
you
and
as
you
perceive
we
done
it
then
it
must
have
been
months
ago
months
ago
said
sack
before
all
this
do
i
remember
something
about
it
i
had
such
trouble
since
i
been
so
distracted
one
way
and
another
it
may
have
slipped
away
out
of
my
memory
under
the
stress
sack
he
paused
and
looked
round
the
room
helplessly
sack
well
sack
is
here
now
we
sorry
you
had
trouble
said
sympathetically
it
what
everybody
has
though
man
that
is
born
of
woman
is
full
of
misery
that
what
the
burial
service
says
and
it
ought
to
know
sack
again
turned
bewildered
eyes
on
to
her
oh
are
you
a
pretty
he
again
began
when
do
you
think
sack
will
be
back
interrupted
i
wish
i
knew
i
wish
i
could
hope
but
she
gone
for
a
long
while
i
afraid
gone
not
to
come
back
at
all
do
you
mean
asked
sack
gulped
i
afraid
that
is
her
intention
he
said
miserably
there
was
a
silence
in
which
they
all
stood
looking
at
each
other
did
she
like
you
then
inquired
sure
that
this
was
tactful
gave
her
sleeve
a
little
pull
were
you
unkind
to
her
asked
disregarding
the
warning
sack
his
fingers
clasping
and
unclasping
themselves
behind
his
back
started
walking
up
and
down
the
room
forgetful
of
what
aunt
alice
would
have
said
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
began
to
be
interested
in
sack
the
wives
i
seen
she
remarked
watching
sack
with
friendly
and
interested
eyes
who
were
chiefly
aunt
alice
that
uncle
wife
the
one
we
the
nieces
of
seemed
to
put
up
with
the
utmost
contumely
from
their
husbands
and
yet
did
budge
you
must
have
been
something
awful
to
yours
i
worshipped
sack
burst
out
sack
i
worshipped
her
i
do
worship
her
she
was
the
handsomest
brightest
woman
in
boston
i
was
as
proud
of
her
as
any
man
has
ever
been
of
his
wife
then
why
did
she
go
asked
i
do
think
that
the
sort
of
thing
you
should
ask
rebuked
but
if
i
do
ask
i
wo
be
told
said
ann
felicitas
and
interested
sack
went
because
i
was
able
i
was
so
constructed
that
i
could
be
fond
of
other
people
as
well
as
of
her
said
sack
well
nothing
unusual
said
no
said
i
do
see
anything
in
that
i
think
it
shows
a
humane
and
friendly
spirit
said
besides
it
enjoined
in
the
bible
said
i
sure
when
we
meet
sack
said
very
politely
indeed
much
as
we
expect
to
like
her
we
shall
nevertheless
continue
to
like
other
people
as
well
you
for
instance
will
she
mind
that
it
was
so
much
that
i
liked
other
people
said
sack
walking
about
and
thinking
tumultuously
aloud
rather
than
addressing
anybody
but
that
i
liked
other
people
so
i
see
said
nodding
you
overdid
it
like
whipped
cream
only
it
was
you
but
sack
who
got
the
resulting
ache
and
are
i
aching
are
i
suffering
yes
but
you
did
the
said
the
world
said
the
unhappy
sack
quickening
his
pace
is
so
full
of
charming
and
delightful
people
is
one
to
shut
one
eyes
to
them
of
course
not
said
one
must
love
them
yes
yes
said
sack
exactly
that
what
i
did
and
though
i
would
wish
said
to
say
anything
against
somebody
who
so
very
nearly
was
my
hostess
yet
really
you
know
was
sack
attitude
rather
churlish
sack
gazed
at
her
oh
are
you
a
pretty
he
began
again
with
a
kind
of
agonized
enthusiasm
but
he
was
again
cut
short
by
on
whom
facts
of
a
disturbing
nature
were
beginning
to
press
aunt
alice
she
said
looking
and
feeling
extremely
perturbed
as
the
situation
slowly
grew
clear
to
her
told
us
we
were
never
to
stay
with
people
whose
wives
are
somewhere
else
unless
they
have
a
mother
or
other
female
relative
living
with
them
she
was
most
particular
about
it
and
said
whatever
else
we
did
we
were
ever
to
do
this
so
afraid
she
continued
in
her
politest
voice
determined
to
behave
beautifully
under
circumstances
that
were
trying
much
as
we
should
have
enjoyed
staying
with
you
and
sack
if
she
had
been
here
to
stay
with
seeing
that
she
is
we
manifestly
ca
you
ca
stay
with
me
murmured
sack
turning
his
bewildered
eyes
to
her
were
you
going
to
of
course
we
were
going
to
it
what
we
come
for
said
and
i
afraid
disappointed
as
we
are
unless
you
can
produce
a
mother
but
where
on
earth
are
we
to
go
to
inquired
who
being
lazy
having
got
to
a
place
preferred
if
possible
to
stay
in
it
and
who
besides
was
sure
that
in
their
forlorn
situation
a
sack
in
the
hand
was
worth
two
sacks
not
in
it
any
day
also
she
liked
the
look
of
sack
in
spite
of
his
being
so
obviously
out
of
repair
he
badly
wanted
doing
up
she
said
to
herself
but
on
the
other
hand
he
seemed
to
her
lovable
in
his
distress
with
much
of
the
pathetic
helplessness
her
own
dear
irish
terrier
left
behind
in
germany
had
had
the
day
he
caught
his
foot
in
a
rabbit
trap
he
had
looked
at
while
she
was
trying
to
get
him
out
of
it
with
just
the
same
expression
on
his
face
that
sack
had
on
his
as
he
walked
about
the
room
twisting
and
untwisting
his
fingers
behind
his
back
only
her
irish
terrier
had
had
a
gibson
profile
also
he
had
looked
much
more
efficient
ca
you
by
any
chance
produce
a
mother
she
asked
sack
stared
at
her
of
course
we
very
sorry
said
sack
stared
at
her
but
you
understand
i
sure
that
under
the
circumstances
do
you
say
said
sack
stopping
still
after
a
few
more
turns
in
front
of
and
making
a
great
effort
to
collect
his
thoughts
that
i
that
we
had
arranged
to
look
after
you
arranged
with
uncle
arthur
said
uncle
arthur
abinger
of
course
you
had
that
why
we
here
why
you
wrote
bidding
us
welcome
he
showed
us
the
letter
abinger
abinger
oh
man
said
sack
his
mind
clearing
we
thought
you
probably
feel
like
that
about
him
said
sympathetically
why
then
said
sack
his
mind
getting
suddenly
quite
clear
you
must
be
why
you
the
twinklers
we
been
drawing
your
attention
to
that
at
frequent
intervals
since
we
got
here
said
but
whether
you
now
remember
or
still
do
realize
said
with
great
firmness
i
afraid
we
got
to
say
that
all
very
well
again
protested
but
where
are
we
to
go
to
go
said
with
a
dignity
very
creditable
in
one
of
her
size
ultimately
to
california
of
course
to
uncle
arthur
other
friends
but
now
this
afternoon
we
get
back
into
a
train
and
go
to
clark
to
mr
twist
he
at
least
has
a
mother
chapter
xv
and
so
it
came
about
that
just
as
the
reunited
twists
mother
son
and
daughter
were
sitting
in
the
a
little
tired
after
a
long
afternoon
of
affection
waiting
for
seven
to
strike
and
with
the
striking
amanda
the
head
maid
to
appear
and
announce
supper
but
waiting
with
lassitude
for
they
had
not
yet
recovered
from
an
elaborate
welcoming
dinner
the
twinklers
in
the
lovely
twilight
of
a
golden
day
were
hastening
up
the
winding
road
from
the
station
towards
them
silent
and
a
little
exhausted
the
unconscious
twists
sat
in
their
a
place
of
marble
and
antimacassars
while
these
light
figures
their
shoes
white
with
the
dust
of
a
that
had
had
no
rain
for
weeks
sped
every
moment
nearer
the
road
wound
gently
upwards
through
fields
and
woods
through
quiet
delicious
evening
country
and
there
was
one
little
star
twinkling
encouragingly
at
the
twins
from
over
where
they
supposed
clark
would
be
at
the
station
there
had
been
neither
porter
nor
conveyance
nor
indeed
anybody
or
anything
at
all
except
themselves
their
luggage
and
a
thin
kind
man
who
represented
authority
clark
is
two
miles
away
from
its
station
and
all
the
way
to
it
is
uninhabited
just
at
the
station
are
a
cluster
of
those
hasty
buildings
america
flings
down
in
places
till
she
shall
have
leisure
to
make
a
splendid
city
but
the
road
immediately
curved
away
from
these
up
into
solitude
and
the
evening
sky
you
ca
miss
it
encouraged
the
keep
right
along
after
your
noses
till
they
knock
up
against
mrs
twist
front
gate
i
look
after
the
menagerie
thus
did
he
describe
the
twinkler
luggage
guess
mrs
twist
be
sending
for
it
as
soon
as
you
get
there
guess
she
forgot
you
guess
she
shaken
up
by
young
mr
arriving
this
very
day
would
have
forgotten
you
no
not
for
a
dozen
young
twists
he
added
gallantly
why
do
you
call
him
young
mr
twist
inquired
when
he
is
he
must
be
at
least
thirty
or
forty
or
fifty
you
see
we
know
him
quite
well
said
proudly
as
they
walked
off
he
a
friend
of
ours
you
do
say
said
the
who
was
chewing
gum
and
as
the
twins
had
not
yet
seen
this
being
done
they
concluded
he
had
been
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
a
meal
by
the
arrival
of
the
train
now
mind
he
called
after
them
you
do
whatever
the
road
does
give
yourselves
up
to
it
and
however
much
it
winds
about
stick
to
it
meet
other
roads
but
do
you
take
any
notice
of
them
freed
from
their
luggage
and
for
a
moment
from
all
care
the
twins
went
up
the
hill
it
was
the
nicest
thing
in
the
world
to
be
going
to
see
their
friend
again
in
quite
a
few
minutes
they
had
ever
since
the
collapse
of
the
sack
arrangements
been
missing
him
very
much
as
they
hurried
on
through
the
scented
woods
past
quiet
fields
between
hedges
the
evening
sky
growing
duskier
and
the
beckoning
star
lighter
they
remembered
mr
twist
extraordinary
kindness
his
devoted
and
unfailing
care
with
the
warmest
feelings
of
gratitude
and
affection
even
felt
warm
how
often
had
he
rearranged
her
head
when
it
was
hopelessly
rolling
about
how
often
had
he
fed
her
when
she
felt
better
enough
to
be
hungry
was
very
hungry
she
still
thought
highly
of
pride
and
independence
but
now
considered
their
proper
place
was
after
a
good
meal
and
with
all
the
shameless
cheerfulness
of
one
who
for
a
little
has
got
rid
of
her
pride
and
is
feeling
very
much
more
comfortable
in
consequence
remarked
that
one
must
overdo
independence
let
hurry
said
i
so
dreadfully
hungry
i
do
so
terribly
want
supper
and
i
sure
it
and
the
twists
will
have
finished
and
we
might
get
any
as
though
mr
twist
would
see
to
that
exclaimed
proud
and
confident
but
she
did
begin
to
run
for
she
too
was
very
hungry
and
they
raced
the
rest
of
the
way
which
is
why
they
arrived
on
the
twist
doorstep
panting
and
could
at
first
answer
amanda
the
head
maid
surprised
and
ungarnished
inquiry
as
to
what
they
wanted
when
she
opened
the
door
and
found
them
there
we
want
mr
twist
said
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
amanda
eyed
them
you
from
the
village
she
asked
thinking
perhaps
they
might
be
a
deputation
of
elder
school
children
sent
to
recite
welcoming
poems
to
mr
twist
on
his
safe
return
from
the
seat
of
war
yet
she
knew
all
the
school
children
and
everybody
else
in
clark
and
none
of
them
were
these
no
from
the
station
panted
we
did
see
any
village
panted
we
want
mr
twist
please
said
struggling
with
her
breath
amanda
eyed
them
having
supper
she
said
curtly
fortunate
creature
gasped
i
hope
he
is
eating
it
all
will
you
announce
us
please
said
putting
on
her
dignity
the
miss
twinklers
the
who
said
amanda
the
miss
twinklers
said
putting
on
still
more
dignity
for
there
was
that
in
amanda
manner
which
roused
the
junker
in
her
ca
disturb
him
at
supper
said
amanda
briefly
i
assure
you
said
with
the
earnestness
of
conviction
that
he
like
it
i
think
i
can
undertake
to
promise
he
show
no
resentment
whatever
amanda
half
shut
the
door
we
come
in
please
said
inserting
herself
into
what
was
left
of
the
opening
will
you
kindly
bear
in
mind
that
we
totally
unaccustomed
to
the
doorstep
amanda
doubtful
but
unpractised
in
such
a
situation
permitted
herself
in
spite
of
having
as
she
well
knew
the
whole
of
free
and
equal
america
behind
her
to
be
cowed
well
perhaps
not
cowed
but
taken
aback
it
was
the
long
words
and
the
awful
politeness
that
did
it
she
was
used
to
beautiful
long
words
like
that
except
on
sundays
when
the
clergyman
read
the
prayers
in
church
and
she
was
used
to
politeness
that
so
much
of
it
should
come
out
of
objects
so
young
rendered
amanda
temporarily
dumb
she
wavered
with
the
door
instantly
slipped
through
it
instantly
followed
her
kindly
tell
your
master
the
miss
twinklers
have
arrived
said
looking
every
inch
a
junker
there
were
many
inches
of
but
every
one
of
them
at
that
moment
faced
by
amanda
want
of
discipline
was
sheer
junker
amanda
who
had
never
met
a
junker
in
her
happy
democratic
life
was
stirred
into
bristling
emotion
by
the
word
master
she
was
about
to
fling
the
insult
of
it
from
her
by
an
impetuous
and
assertion
that
if
he
was
her
master
she
was
his
mistress
and
so
there
now
when
the
bell
which
had
rung
once
already
since
they
had
been
standing
parleying
rang
again
and
more
impatiently
and
the
door
opened
and
a
head
appeared
the
twins
did
know
that
it
was
edith
head
but
it
was
amanda
began
edith
in
the
appealing
voice
that
was
the
nearest
she
ever
dared
get
to
rebuke
without
amanda
giving
notice
but
she
stopped
on
seeing
what
in
the
dusk
of
the
hall
looked
like
a
crowd
oh
said
edith
taken
aback
oh
and
was
for
withdrawing
her
head
and
shutting
the
door
but
the
twins
advanced
towards
her
and
the
stream
of
light
shining
behind
her
and
the
agreeable
smell
streaming
past
her
with
outstretched
hands
how
do
you
do
they
both
said
cordially
go
away
again
edith
feeling
that
here
was
something
to
protect
her
quietly
feeding
mother
from
came
rather
hastily
through
the
door
and
held
it
to
behind
her
while
her
unresponsive
and
surprised
hand
was
taken
and
shaken
even
as
sack
had
been
we
come
to
see
mr
twist
said
he
our
friend
said
he
our
best
friend
said
is
he
in
there
asked
appreciatively
moving
her
nose
a
particularly
delicate
instrument
round
among
the
various
really
heavenly
smells
that
were
issuing
from
the
and
sorting
them
out
and
guessing
what
they
probably
represented
the
while
water
rushed
into
her
mouth
the
sound
of
a
chair
being
hastily
pushed
back
was
heard
and
mr
twist
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
what
is
it
edward
a
voice
inside
said
mr
twist
was
a
pale
man
whose
skin
under
no
circumstances
changed
colour
except
in
his
ears
these
turned
red
when
he
was
stirred
and
they
were
red
now
and
seemed
translucent
with
the
bright
light
behind
him
shining
through
them
the
twins
flew
to
him
it
was
wonderful
how
much
pleased
they
were
to
see
him
again
it
was
as
if
for
years
they
had
been
separated
from
their
dearest
friend
the
few
hours
since
the
night
before
had
been
enough
to
turn
their
friendship
and
esteem
for
him
into
a
warm
proprietary
affection
they
felt
that
mr
twist
belonged
to
them
even
felt
it
and
her
eyes
as
she
beheld
him
were
bright
with
pleasure
oh
there
you
are
cried
darting
forward
gladness
in
her
voice
and
catching
hold
of
his
arm
we
come
said
beaming
and
catching
hold
of
his
other
arm
we
got
into
difficulties
said
we
got
into
them
at
once
said
they
were
our
difficulties
they
were
the
sacks
but
they
reacted
on
us
and
so
here
we
are
who
is
it
edward
asked
the
voice
inside
sack
ran
away
yesterday
from
sack
went
on
eagerly
sack
was
still
quite
warm
and
moist
from
it
when
we
got
there
said
aunt
alice
said
we
were
ever
to
stay
in
a
house
where
they
did
that
said
where
there
was
a
lady
said
so
when
we
saw
that
she
was
there
because
she
gone
we
turned
straight
round
to
you
said
anna
rose
like
flowers
turning
to
the
sun
said
even
in
that
moment
of
excitement
not
without
complacency
at
her
own
aptness
and
left
our
things
at
the
station
rushed
on
and
ran
practically
the
whole
way
said
because
of
perhaps
being
late
for
supper
and
you
having
eaten
it
all
and
we
so
dreadfully
hungry
who
is
it
edward
again
called
the
voice
inside
louder
and
more
insistently
mr
twist
did
answer
he
was
quickly
turning
over
the
situation
in
his
mind
he
had
not
mentioned
the
twins
to
his
mother
which
would
have
been
natural
seeing
how
very
few
hours
he
had
of
reunion
with
her
if
she
had
happened
to
have
questioned
him
particularly
as
to
his
on
the
boat
her
questions
had
been
confined
to
the
passengers
and
he
had
said
truthfully
that
he
had
hardly
spoken
to
one
of
them
and
not
at
all
to
any
of
the
women
mrs
twist
had
been
relieved
for
she
lived
in
dread
of
becoming
as
she
put
it
to
herself
entangled
with
ladies
sin
would
be
bad
enough
for
mrs
twist
was
obliged
reluctantly
to
know
that
even
with
ladies
it
is
possible
to
sin
but
marriage
for
edward
would
be
even
worse
because
it
lasted
longer
sin
terrible
though
it
was
had
at
least
this
to
be
said
for
it
that
it
could
be
repented
of
and
done
with
and
repentance
after
all
was
a
creditable
activity
but
there
was
no
repenting
of
marriage
with
any
credit
it
was
a
holy
thing
and
you
do
repent
of
holy
things
at
least
you
ought
to
if
as
young
men
so
often
would
edward
wanted
as
years
went
on
to
marry
in
spite
of
his
already
having
an
affectionate
and
sympathetic
home
with
feminine
society
in
it
then
it
seemed
to
mrs
twist
most
important
most
vital
to
the
future
comfort
of
the
family
that
it
should
be
someone
she
had
chosen
herself
she
had
observed
him
from
infancy
and
knew
much
better
than
he
what
was
needed
for
his
happiness
and
she
also
knew
if
there
must
be
a
wife
what
was
needed
for
the
happiness
of
his
mother
and
sister
she
had
not
thought
to
inquire
about
the
passengers
for
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
a
son
of
hers
could
drift
out
of
his
natural
sphere
into
the
slums
of
a
ship
and
mr
twist
had
seen
no
reason
for
hurrying
the
twinklers
into
her
mental
range
not
during
those
first
hours
anyhow
there
would
be
plenty
of
hours
and
he
felt
that
sufficient
unto
the
day
would
be
the
twinklers
thereof
but
the
part
that
was
really
making
his
ears
red
was
that
he
had
said
nothing
about
the
evening
with
the
twins
in
new
york
when
his
mother
asked
with
the
fondness
of
the
occasion
what
had
detained
him
he
said
as
many
another
honest
man
pressed
by
the
searching
affection
of
relations
has
said
before
him
that
it
was
business
now
it
appeared
that
he
would
have
to
go
into
the
and
say
no
it
business
it
was
these
his
ears
glowed
just
to
think
of
it
he
hated
to
lie
specially
he
hated
to
have
lied
at
the
moment
one
plunged
in
spurred
by
sudden
necessity
and
then
was
left
sorrowfully
contemplating
degradation
his
own
desire
was
always
to
be
candid
but
his
mother
he
well
knew
could
not
bear
the
pains
candour
gave
her
she
had
been
so
terribly
hurt
so
grievously
wounded
when
fresh
from
praying
for
before
he
went
to
harvard
he
used
to
pray
he
had
on
one
or
two
occasions
for
a
few
minutes
endeavoured
not
to
lie
to
her
that
sheer
fright
at
the
effect
of
his
unfiliality
made
him
apologize
and
beg
her
to
forget
it
and
forgive
him
now
she
was
going
to
be
still
more
wounded
by
his
having
lied
the
meticulous
tortuousness
of
family
life
struck
mr
twist
with
a
sudden
great
impatience
after
that
large
life
over
there
in
france
to
come
back
to
this
dreary
petticoat
lying
this
feeling
one
way
about
among
tender
places
who
is
it
edward
called
the
voice
inside
for
the
third
time
there
someone
in
there
seems
quite
particularly
to
want
to
know
who
we
are
said
why
not
tell
her
i
expect
it
your
mother
said
feeling
the
full
satisfaction
of
having
got
to
a
house
from
which
the
lady
had
run
anywhere
it
is
said
mr
twist
briefly
edith
called
the
voice
much
more
peremptorily
edith
started
and
half
went
in
but
hesitated
and
quite
stayed
out
she
was
gazing
at
the
twinklers
with
the
same
kind
eyes
her
brother
had
but
without
the
disfiguring
spectacles
astonishment
and
perplexity
and
anxiety
were
mixed
with
the
kindness
amanda
also
gazed
and
if
the
twins
had
been
so
sure
of
their
welcome
even
they
might
gradually
have
begun
to
perceive
that
it
was
exactly
edith
edward
amanda
called
the
voice
this
time
with
unmistakable
anger
for
one
more
moment
mr
twist
stood
uncertain
looking
down
at
the
happy
confident
faces
turned
up
to
him
exactly
as
had
just
said
like
flowers
turning
to
the
sun
visions
of
france
flashed
before
him
visions
of
what
he
had
known
what
he
had
just
come
back
from
his
friends
over
there
the
gay
courage
the
helpfulness
the
ready
uninquiring
affection
the
breadth
of
outlook
the
quick
friendliness
the
careless
assumption
that
one
was
decent
that
one
intentions
were
good
why
should
he
pull
some
of
the
splendid
stuff
into
his
poor
lame
little
home
why
should
he
let
himself
drop
back
from
heights
like
those
to
the
old
ridiculous
timidities
the
miserable
habit
of
avoiding
the
truth
rebellion
hope
determination
seized
mr
twist
his
eyes
shone
behind
his
spectacles
his
ears
were
two
red
flags
of
revolution
he
gripped
hold
of
the
twins
one
under
each
arm
you
come
right
in
he
said
louder
than
he
had
ever
spoken
in
his
life
edith
see
these
girls
they
the
two
annas
their
other
name
is
twinkler
but
anna
see
you
through
they
want
supper
and
they
want
beds
and
they
want
affection
and
they
going
to
get
it
all
so
hustle
with
the
food
and
send
the
cadillac
for
their
baggage
and
fix
up
things
for
them
as
comfortably
as
you
know
how
and
as
for
sack
he
said
looking
first
at
one
twin
and
then
at
the
other
if
it
had
been
for
her
running
away
from
her
worthless
husband
convinced
that
fellow
sack
is
worthless
you
might
never
have
come
here
at
all
so
you
see
he
finished
laughing
at
how
good
comes
out
of
evil
and
with
the
sound
of
these
words
preceding
him
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
marched
them
in
chapter
xvi
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat
his
mother
long
straight
and
grave
she
was
in
the
seat
of
authority
the
one
with
its
back
to
the
windows
and
its
face
to
the
door
from
whence
she
could
see
what
everybody
did
especially
amanda
having
seen
what
amanda
did
she
then
complained
to
edith
she
did
complain
direct
to
amanda
because
amanda
could
and
did
give
notice
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
between
it
and
her
was
the
table
covered
with
admirable
things
to
eat
it
being
supper
and
therefore
according
to
a
twist
tradition
surviving
from
penurious
days
all
the
food
hot
and
cold
sweet
and
salt
being
brought
in
together
and
amanda
only
attending
when
rung
for
oyster
patties
lay
on
mrs
twist
plate
in
her
glass
neglected
champagne
had
bubbled
itself
flat
her
hand
still
held
her
fork
but
loosely
as
an
object
that
had
lost
its
interest
and
her
eyes
and
ears
for
the
last
five
minutes
had
not
departed
from
the
door
at
first
she
had
felt
mere
resigned
annoyance
that
amanda
should
have
answered
the
bell
but
she
did
wish
to
cast
a
shadow
over
homecoming
by
drawing
poor
edith
attention
before
him
to
how
very
badly
she
trained
the
helps
and
therefore
she
said
nothing
at
the
moment
then
when
edith
going
in
search
of
amanda
had
opened
the
door
and
let
in
sounds
of
argument
she
was
surprised
for
she
knew
no
one
so
intimately
that
they
would
be
likely
to
call
at
such
an
hour
but
when
edward
too
leapt
up
and
went
out
and
stayed
out
and
failed
to
answer
her
repeated
calls
she
was
first
astonished
then
indignant
and
then
suddenly
was
overcome
by
a
cold
foreboding
mrs
twist
often
had
forebodings
and
they
were
always
cold
they
seized
her
with
bleak
fingers
and
one
of
edith
chief
functions
was
to
comfort
and
reassure
her
for
as
long
a
while
each
time
as
was
required
to
reach
the
stage
of
being
able
to
shake
them
off
here
was
one
however
too
icily
convincing
to
be
shaken
off
it
fell
upon
her
with
the
swiftness
of
a
revelation
something
unpleasant
was
going
to
happen
to
her
something
perhaps
worse
than
unpleasant
disastrous
and
something
immediate
those
excited
voices
out
in
the
hall
they
were
young
surely
and
they
were
feminine
also
they
sounded
most
intimate
with
edward
what
had
he
been
concealing
from
her
what
disgracefulness
had
penetrated
through
him
through
the
son
the
neighbourhood
thought
so
much
of
into
her
very
home
she
was
a
widow
he
was
her
only
son
impossible
to
believe
he
would
betray
so
sacred
a
position
that
he
whom
she
had
so
lovingly
and
proudly
welcomed
a
few
hours
before
would
allow
his
well
she
really
did
know
what
to
call
them
but
anyhow
female
friends
of
whom
she
had
been
told
nothing
to
enter
that
place
which
to
every
decent
human
being
is
inviolable
his
mother
home
yet
mrs
twist
did
instantly
believe
it
then
edward
voice
raised
and
defiant
surely
defiant
came
through
the
crack
in
the
door
and
every
word
he
said
was
quite
distinct
anna
supper
affection
mrs
twist
sat
frozen
and
then
the
door
was
flung
open
and
edward
tumultuously
entered
his
ears
crimson
his
face
as
she
had
never
seen
it
and
in
each
hand
held
tightly
by
the
arm
a
girl
edward
had
been
deceiving
her
mother
he
began
how
do
you
do
said
the
girls
together
and
actually
with
smiles
edward
had
been
deceiving
her
that
whole
afternoon
how
quiet
he
had
been
how
listless
quite
gentle
quite
affectionate
but
listless
and
untalkative
she
had
thought
he
must
be
tired
worn
out
with
his
long
journey
across
from
europe
she
had
made
allowances
for
him
been
sympathetic
been
considerate
and
look
at
him
now
never
had
she
seen
him
with
a
face
like
that
he
was
mrs
twist
groped
for
the
word
and
reluctantly
found
it
rollicking
yes
that
was
the
word
that
exactly
described
him
rollicking
if
she
had
observed
his
languor
up
to
a
few
minutes
ago
at
supper
and
seen
him
with
her
own
eyes
refuse
champagne
and
turn
his
back
on
cocktails
she
would
have
been
forced
to
the
conclusion
dreadful
though
it
was
to
a
mother
that
he
had
been
drinking
and
the
girls
two
of
them
and
so
young
mrs
twist
had
known
edward
as
she
sometimes
informed
edith
all
his
life
and
had
not
yet
found
anything
in
his
morals
which
was
not
blameless
watch
him
with
what
loving
care
she
might
she
had
found
nothing
and
she
was
sure
her
mother
instinct
would
not
have
failed
her
nevertheless
even
with
that
white
past
before
her
he
had
told
her
about
madame
bovary
she
now
instantly
believed
the
worst
it
was
the
habit
of
clark
to
believe
the
worst
clark
was
very
small
and
therefore
also
very
virtuous
each
inhabitant
was
the
careful
guardian
of
his
neighhour
conduct
nobody
there
ever
did
anything
that
was
wrong
there
was
a
chance
but
as
nature
insists
on
a
balance
the
minds
of
clark
dwelt
curiously
on
evil
they
were
minds
active
in
suspicion
they
leapt
with
an
instantaneous
agility
at
the
worst
conclusions
nothing
was
ever
said
in
clark
but
everything
was
thought
the
older
inhabitants
made
fast
prisoners
in
their
mould
of
virtue
by
age
watched
with
jealous
care
the
behaviour
of
those
still
young
enough
to
attract
temptation
the
younger
ones
brought
up
in
inhibitions
settled
down
to
wakefulness
in
regard
to
each
other
everything
was
provided
and
encouraged
in
clark
a
place
of
pleasant
orchards
and
gentle
fields
except
the
things
that
had
to
do
with
love
husbands
were
there
and
there
was
a
public
library
and
social
afternoons
and
an
emerson
society
the
husbands
died
before
the
wives
being
less
able
to
cope
with
virtue
and
a
street
in
clark
of
smaller
houses
into
which
their
widows
gravitated
had
been
christened
by
the
stationmaster
a
more
worldly
man
because
of
his
three
miles
off
and
all
the
trains
lamentation
lane
in
this
village
mrs
twist
had
lived
since
her
marriage
full
of
dignity
and
honour
as
a
wife
she
had
been
full
of
it
for
the
elder
mr
twist
had
been
good
even
when
alive
and
as
a
widow
she
had
been
still
fuller
for
the
elder
mr
twist
positively
improved
by
being
dead
not
a
breath
had
ever
touched
her
and
her
children
not
the
most
daring
and
distrustful
clark
mind
had
ever
thought
of
her
except
respectfully
and
now
here
was
this
happening
to
her
at
her
age
when
she
was
least
able
to
bear
it
she
sat
in
silence
staring
with
sombre
eyes
at
the
three
figures
mother
began
edward
again
but
was
again
interrupted
by
the
twins
who
said
together
as
they
had
now
got
into
the
habit
of
saying
when
confronted
by
silent
and
surprised
americans
we
come
it
was
that
they
thought
it
a
particularly
good
conversational
opening
it
was
because
silence
and
surprise
on
the
part
of
the
other
person
seemed
to
call
for
explanation
on
theirs
and
they
were
constitutionally
desirous
of
giving
all
the
information
in
their
power
how
do
you
do
they
then
repeated
loosening
themselves
from
mr
twist
and
advancing
down
the
room
with
outstretched
hands
mr
twist
came
with
them
mother
he
said
these
are
the
twinkler
girls
their
name
twinkler
they
freed
as
he
felt
he
was
from
his
old
bonds
determined
as
he
felt
he
was
on
emulating
the
perfect
candour
and
simplicity
of
the
twins
and
the
perfect
candour
and
simplicity
of
his
comrades
in
france
his
dead
want
of
the
smallest
reaction
to
this
announcement
tripped
him
up
for
a
moment
and
prevented
his
going
on
but
nothing
ever
prevented
the
twins
going
on
if
they
were
pleased
and
excited
they
went
on
with
cheerful
gusto
and
if
they
were
unnerved
and
frightened
they
still
went
on
perhaps
even
more
volubly
anxiously
seeking
cover
behind
a
multitude
of
words
mrs
twist
had
not
yet
unnerved
and
frightened
them
because
they
were
too
much
delighted
that
they
had
got
to
her
at
all
the
relief
experienced
at
having
safely
piloted
that
difficult
craft
the
clumsy
if
adorable
columbus
into
a
respectable
port
was
so
immense
that
it
immediately
vented
itself
in
words
of
warmest
welcome
to
the
lady
in
the
chair
to
her
own
home
we
glad
to
see
you
here
she
said
smiling
till
her
dimple
seemed
to
be
everywhere
at
once
hardly
able
to
refrain
from
giving
the
lady
a
welcome
hug
instead
of
just
inhospitably
shaking
her
hand
she
could
even
shake
her
hand
however
because
it
still
held
immovably
the
fork
it
would
have
been
too
awful
therefore
finished
putting
the
heartiness
of
the
handshake
she
wanted
to
give
into
her
voice
instead
if
had
happened
to
have
run
away
too
as
sack
has
done
from
her
husband
explained
smiling
too
benevolently
at
the
black
lady
who
actually
having
got
oyster
patties
on
her
plate
had
bothered
to
eat
them
but
of
course
you
could
she
went
on
remembering
in
time
to
be
tactful
and
make
a
sympathetic
reference
to
the
lady
weeds
which
indeed
considering
mr
twist
had
told
her
and
that
his
father
had
died
when
he
was
ten
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
seemed
to
have
kept
their
heads
up
astonishingly
and
stayed
very
fresh
and
true
to
her
german
training
and
undaunted
by
the
fork
she
did
that
which
in
her
contentment
had
forgotten
and
catching
up
mrs
twist
right
hand
fork
and
all
to
her
lips
gave
it
the
brief
ceremonious
kiss
of
a
well
brought
up
junker
like
amanda
mrs
twist
life
had
been
up
to
this
empty
of
junkers
she
had
never
even
heard
of
them
till
the
war
and
pronounced
their
name
and
so
did
the
rest
of
clark
following
her
lead
as
if
it
had
been
junket
only
with
an
r
instead
of
a
t
at
the
end
she
did
therefore
recognize
the
action
but
even
she
outraged
as
she
was
could
not
but
see
its
grace
and
looking
up
in
sombre
hostility
at
the
little
head
bent
over
her
hand
and
at
the
dark
line
of
eyelashes
on
the
the
flushed
face
she
thought
swiftly
the
one
you
see
mother
said
mr
twist
pulling
a
chair
vigorously
and
sitting
on
it
with
determination
it
like
this
sit
down
you
two
and
get
eating
start
on
anything
you
see
in
this
show
that
hits
your
fancy
edith
be
fetching
you
something
hot
i
expect
soup
or
something
but
meanwhile
here
enough
stuff
to
go
on
with
you
see
mother
he
resumed
turning
squarely
to
her
while
the
twins
obeyed
him
with
immense
alacrity
and
sat
down
and
began
to
eat
whatever
happened
to
be
nearest
them
these
two
girls
well
to
start
with
they
twins
mr
twist
was
stopped
again
by
his
mother
face
she
could
conceive
why
he
should
lie
twins
the
world
over
matched
in
size
and
features
it
was
notorious
that
they
did
also
it
was
the
custom
for
them
to
match
in
age
and
the
tall
one
of
these
was
at
least
a
year
older
than
the
other
one
but
still
thought
mrs
twist
let
that
pass
she
would
suffer
whatever
it
was
she
had
to
suffer
in
silence
the
twins
too
were
silent
because
they
were
so
busy
eating
perfectly
at
home
under
the
wing
they
knew
so
well
they
behaved
with
an
easy
naturalness
that
appeared
to
mrs
twist
outrageous
but
still
let
that
too
pass
these
strangers
helped
themselves
and
helped
each
other
as
if
everything
belonged
to
them
and
the
tall
one
actually
asked
her
her
the
mistress
of
the
house
if
she
could
get
anything
well
let
that
pass
too
you
see
mother
began
mr
twist
again
he
was
finding
it
extraordinarily
difficult
what
a
tremendous
hold
one
early
training
had
on
one
he
reflected
casting
about
for
words
what
a
deeply
rooted
fear
there
was
in
one
subconscious
lurking
in
one
foundations
of
one
mother
of
her
authority
of
her
quickly
wounded
affection
those
jesuits
with
their
conviction
that
they
could
do
what
they
liked
with
a
man
if
they
had
had
the
bringing
up
of
him
till
he
was
seven
were
pretty
near
the
truth
it
took
a
lot
of
shaking
off
the
unquestioning
awe
the
habit
of
obedience
of
one
childhood
mr
twist
sat
endeavouring
to
shake
it
off
he
also
tried
to
bolster
himself
up
by
thinking
he
might
perhaps
be
able
to
assist
his
mother
to
come
out
from
her
narrowness
and
discover
too
how
warm
and
glorious
the
sun
shone
outside
where
people
loved
and
helped
each
other
then
he
rejected
that
as
priggish
you
see
mother
he
started
again
i
came
across
them
across
these
two
girls
they
both
called
anna
by
the
way
which
seems
confusing
but
is
really
i
came
across
them
on
the
boat
he
again
stopped
dead
mrs
twist
had
turned
her
dark
eyes
to
him
they
had
been
fixed
on
and
on
what
she
was
doing
with
the
dish
of
oyster
patties
in
front
of
her
what
she
was
doing
was
not
what
mrs
twist
was
accustomed
to
see
done
at
her
table
was
behaving
badly
with
the
patties
and
not
even
attempting
to
conceal
as
the
decent
do
how
terribly
they
interested
her
you
came
across
them
on
the
boat
repeated
mrs
twist
her
eyes
on
her
son
moved
in
spite
of
her
resolution
to
speech
and
he
had
told
her
that
very
afternoon
that
he
had
spoken
to
nobody
except
men
another
lie
well
let
that
pass
too
mr
twist
sat
staring
back
at
her
through
his
big
gleaming
spectacles
he
well
knew
the
weakness
of
his
position
from
his
mother
point
of
view
but
why
should
she
have
such
a
point
of
view
such
a
niggling
narrow
one
determined
to
stay
angry
and
offended
because
he
had
been
stupid
enough
to
continue
under
the
influence
of
her
presence
the
old
system
of
not
being
candid
with
her
of
being
slavishly
anxious
to
avoid
offending
let
her
try
for
once
to
understand
and
forgive
let
her
for
once
take
the
chance
offered
her
of
doing
a
big
kind
thing
but
as
he
stared
at
her
it
entered
his
mind
that
he
could
very
well
start
moving
her
heart
on
behalf
of
the
twins
in
their
presence
he
tell
her
they
were
orphans
alone
in
the
world
helpless
poor
and
so
unfortunately
german
with
them
sitting
there
if
he
did
there
would
be
trouble
the
twins
seemed
absorbed
for
the
moment
in
getting
fed
but
he
had
no
doubt
their
ears
were
attentive
and
at
the
first
suggestion
of
sympathy
being
invoked
for
them
they
would
begin
to
say
a
few
of
those
things
he
was
so
much
afraid
his
mother
might
be
able
to
understand
or
if
she
understood
appreciate
he
decided
that
he
would
be
quiet
until
edith
came
back
and
then
ask
his
mother
to
go
to
the
with
him
and
while
edith
was
looking
after
the
annas
he
would
well
out
of
earshot
explain
them
to
his
mother
describe
their
situation
commend
them
to
her
patience
and
her
love
he
sat
silent
therefore
wishing
extraordinarily
hard
that
edith
would
be
quick
but
eyes
were
upon
him
now
as
well
as
his
mother
is
it
possible
she
asked
with
her
own
peculiar
gentleness
balancing
a
piece
of
patty
on
her
fork
that
you
have
yet
mentioned
us
to
your
mother
and
struck
in
her
turn
at
such
an
omission
paused
too
with
food
on
the
way
to
her
mouth
and
said
and
we
such
friends
almost
as
it
were
still
from
being
with
you
said
both
the
twins
looked
at
mrs
twist
in
their
surprise
i
thought
the
first
thing
everybody
did
when
they
got
back
to
their
mother
said
addressing
her
was
to
tell
her
everything
from
the
beginning
mrs
twist
after
an
instant
astonishment
at
this
unexpected
support
bowed
her
head
it
could
hardly
be
called
a
nod
in
her
son
direction
you
see
the
movement
seemed
to
say
even
these
and
ever
since
the
first
day
at
sea
said
also
addressing
mrs
twist
up
to
as
recently
as
eleven
last
night
he
has
been
what
i
think
can
be
quite
accurately
described
as
our
faithful
companion
yes
said
as
much
as
that
we
been
friends
practically
inseparable
so
that
it
really
is
surprising
said
to
mr
twist
that
you
did
tell
your
mother
about
us
mr
twist
got
up
he
would
wait
for
edith
it
was
unhealthy
in
that
room
he
took
his
mother
arm
and
helped
her
to
get
up
you
very
wise
you
two
he
flung
at
the
twins
in
the
voice
of
the
goaded
but
you
may
take
it
from
me
you
do
know
everything
yet
mother
come
into
the
and
we
talk
edith
see
to
these
girls
i
expect
i
ought
to
have
talked
sooner
he
went
on
as
he
led
her
to
the
door
but
confound
it
all
i
only
been
home
about
a
couple
of
hours
five
said
mrs
twist
five
then
what
five
no
time
at
all
ample
said
mrs
twist
adding
icily
and
did
i
you
say
confound
edward
well
damn
then
said
edward
very
loud
in
a
rush
of
rank
rebellion
chapter
xvii
this
night
was
the
in
mr
twist
life
in
it
he
broke
loose
from
his
mother
he
spent
a
terrible
three
hours
with
her
in
the
and
the
rest
of
the
night
he
strode
up
and
down
his
bedroom
the
autumn
morning
creeping
round
the
house
in
long
white
wisps
found
him
staring
out
of
his
window
very
pale
his
mouth
pulled
together
as
tight
as
it
would
go
his
mother
had
failed
him
she
had
not
understood
and
not
only
simply
not
understood
but
she
had
said
things
when
at
last
she
did
speak
after
he
had
explained
and
pleaded
for
at
least
an
hour
of
an
incredible
bitterness
and
injustice
she
had
seemed
to
hate
him
if
she
had
been
his
mother
mr
twist
would
have
been
certain
she
hated
him
but
he
still
believed
that
mothers
could
hate
their
children
it
was
stark
against
nature
and
mr
twist
still
believed
in
the
fundamental
rightness
of
that
which
is
called
nature
she
had
accused
him
of
gross
things
she
his
mother
who
from
her
conversation
since
he
could
remember
was
unaware
he
had
judged
of
the
very
existence
of
such
things
those
helpless
children
mr
twist
stamped
as
he
strode
well
he
had
made
her
take
that
back
and
indeed
she
had
afterwards
admitted
that
she
said
it
in
her
passion
of
grief
and
disappointment
and
that
it
was
evident
these
girls
were
not
like
that
but
before
they
reached
that
stage
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
saying
straight
out
what
he
wanted
to
say
to
his
mother
just
as
if
she
had
been
an
ordinary
human
being
he
told
her
all
he
knew
of
the
twins
asked
her
to
take
them
in
for
the
present
and
be
good
to
them
and
explained
the
awkwardness
of
their
position
apart
from
its
tragedy
as
germans
by
birth
stranded
in
new
england
where
opinion
at
that
moment
was
so
hostile
to
germans
then
continuing
in
candour
he
had
told
his
mother
that
here
was
her
chance
of
doing
a
fine
and
beautiful
thing
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
mrs
twist
suddenly
began
on
her
side
to
talk
she
had
listened
practically
in
silence
to
the
rest
had
only
started
when
he
explained
the
girls
nationality
but
when
he
came
to
offering
her
these
girls
as
the
great
opportunity
of
her
life
to
do
something
really
good
at
last
she
who
felt
she
had
been
doing
nothing
else
but
noble
and
beautiful
things
and
doing
them
with
the
most
devotion
to
duty
and
the
most
consistent
disregard
of
inclination
could
keep
silence
no
longer
had
she
not
borne
her
great
loss
without
a
murmur
had
she
not
devoted
all
her
years
to
bringing
up
her
son
to
be
a
good
man
had
she
ever
considered
herself
had
she
ever
flagged
in
her
efforts
to
set
an
example
of
patience
in
grief
of
dignity
in
misfortune
she
began
to
speak
and
just
as
amazed
as
she
had
been
at
the
things
this
strange
unknown
son
had
been
saying
to
her
and
at
the
manner
of
their
delivery
so
was
he
amazed
at
the
things
this
strange
unknown
mother
was
saying
to
him
and
at
the
manner
of
their
delivery
yet
his
amazement
was
not
so
great
after
all
as
hers
because
for
years
away
down
hidden
somewhere
inside
him
he
had
doubted
his
mother
for
years
he
had
shocked
at
himself
covered
up
and
trampled
on
these
unworthy
doubts
indignantly
he
had
doubted
her
unselfishness
he
had
doubted
her
sympathy
and
kindliness
he
had
even
doubted
her
honesty
her
ordinary
honesty
with
money
and
accounts
and
lately
before
he
went
to
europe
he
had
caught
himself
thinking
she
was
cruel
nevertheless
this
unexpected
naked
justification
of
his
doubts
was
shattering
to
him
but
mrs
twist
had
never
doubted
edward
she
thought
she
knew
him
inside
out
she
had
watched
him
develop
watched
him
during
the
long
years
of
his
unconsciousness
she
had
been
quite
secure
and
rather
disposed
also
somewhere
down
inside
her
to
a
contempt
for
him
so
easy
had
he
been
to
manage
so
ready
to
do
everything
she
wished
now
it
appeared
that
she
no
more
knew
edward
than
if
he
had
been
a
stranger
in
the
street
the
bursting
of
the
dykes
of
convention
between
them
was
a
horrible
thing
to
them
both
mr
twist
had
none
of
the
cruelty
of
the
younger
generation
to
support
him
he
could
shrug
his
shoulder
and
take
comfort
in
the
thought
that
this
break
between
them
was
entirely
his
mother
fault
for
however
much
he
believed
it
to
be
her
fault
the
belief
merely
made
him
wretched
he
had
none
of
the
pitiless
black
pleasure
to
be
got
from
telling
himself
it
served
her
right
so
naturally
kind
was
he
weak
soft
stupid
his
mother
shook
out
at
him
that
through
all
his
own
shame
at
this
naked
vision
of
what
had
been
carefully
dressed
up
for
years
in
dignified
clothes
of
wisdom
and
affection
he
was
actually
glad
when
he
had
time
in
his
room
to
think
it
over
glad
she
should
be
so
passionately
positive
that
he
and
only
he
was
in
the
wrong
it
would
save
her
from
humiliation
and
of
the
painful
things
of
late
mr
twist
could
least
bear
to
see
a
human
being
humiliated
that
was
however
towards
morning
for
hours
raged
striding
about
his
room
sorting
out
the
fragments
into
which
his
life
as
a
son
had
fallen
trying
to
fit
them
into
some
sort
of
a
pattern
to
see
clear
about
the
future
clearer
not
clear
he
could
hope
for
that
yet
the
future
seemed
one
confused
lump
all
he
could
see
really
clear
of
it
was
that
he
was
going
next
day
and
taking
the
twins
he
would
take
them
to
the
other
people
they
had
a
letter
to
the
people
in
california
and
then
turn
his
face
back
to
europe
to
the
real
thing
to
the
greatness
of
life
where
death
is
not
an
hour
longer
than
he
could
help
would
he
or
they
stay
in
that
house
he
had
told
his
mother
he
would
go
away
and
she
had
said
i
hope
never
to
see
you
again
who
would
have
thought
she
had
so
much
of
passion
in
her
who
would
have
thought
he
had
so
much
of
it
in
him
fury
against
her
injustice
shook
and
shattered
mr
twist
not
so
could
fair
and
affectionate
living
together
be
conducted
on
that
basis
of
suspicion
distrust
jealousy
through
his
instinct
though
not
through
his
brain
shot
the
conviction
that
his
mother
was
jealous
of
the
twins
jealous
of
the
youth
of
the
twins
and
of
their
prettiness
and
goodness
and
of
the
power
unknown
to
them
that
these
things
gave
them
his
brain
was
impervious
to
such
a
conviction
because
it
was
an
innocent
brain
and
the
idea
would
never
have
entered
it
that
a
woman
of
his
mother
age
well
over
sixty
could
be
jealous
in
that
way
but
his
instinct
knew
it
the
last
thing
his
mother
said
as
he
left
the
was
you
have
killed
me
you
have
killed
your
own
mother
and
just
because
of
those
girls
and
mr
twist
shocked
at
this
parting
shot
of
unfairness
could
find
search
as
he
might
nothing
to
be
said
for
his
mother
point
of
view
it
simply
was
true
it
simply
was
delusion
nor
could
she
find
anything
to
be
said
for
his
but
then
she
did
try
to
it
was
so
manifestly
unforgivable
all
she
could
do
faced
by
this
bitter
sorrow
was
to
leave
edward
to
god
sternly
as
he
flung
out
of
the
room
at
last
unsoftened
untouchable
deaf
to
her
even
when
she
used
the
tone
he
had
always
obeyed
the
tone
of
authority
she
said
to
herself
she
must
leave
her
son
to
god
god
knew
god
would
judge
and
clark
too
would
know
and
clark
too
would
judge
left
alone
in
the
on
this
terrible
night
of
her
second
great
bereavement
mrs
twist
was
yet
able
she
was
thankful
to
feel
to
resolve
she
would
try
to
protect
her
son
as
long
as
she
could
from
clark
from
god
she
could
not
if
she
would
protect
him
but
she
would
try
to
protect
him
even
now
as
she
had
always
protected
him
from
earthly
harm
and
hurt
clark
would
however
surely
know
in
time
protect
as
she
might
and
judge
between
her
and
edward
god
knew
already
and
was
already
judging
god

chapter
xviii
the
twins
who
had
gone
to
bed
at
nine
shepherded
by
edith
in
the
happy
conviction
that
they
had
settled
down
comfortably
for
some
time
were
surprised
to
find
at
breakfast
that
they
had
they
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
edith
in
spite
of
a
want
of
restfulness
on
her
part
that
struck
them
while
they
were
finishing
their
supper
and
to
which
at
last
they
drew
her
attention
she
was
so
kind
and
so
like
mr
twist
but
though
she
looked
at
them
with
hospitable
eyes
and
wore
an
expression
of
real
benevolence
it
did
escape
their
notice
that
she
seemed
to
be
listening
to
something
that
was
anyhow
them
and
to
be
expecting
something
that
did
anyhow
happen
she
went
several
times
to
the
door
through
which
her
brother
and
mother
had
disappeared
and
out
into
whatever
part
of
the
house
lay
beyond
it
and
when
she
came
back
after
a
minute
or
two
was
as
wanting
in
composure
as
ever
at
last
finding
these
abrupt
and
repeated
interruptions
hindered
any
real
talk
they
pointed
out
to
her
that
reasoned
conversation
was
impossible
if
one
of
the
parties
persisted
in
not
being
in
the
room
and
inquired
of
her
whether
it
were
peculiar
to
her
or
typical
of
the
inhabitants
of
america
to
keep
on
being
somewhere
else
edith
smiled
abstractedly
at
them
said
nothing
and
went
out
again
she
was
longer
away
this
time
and
the
twins
having
eaten
among
other
things
a
great
many
meringues
grew
weary
of
sitting
with
those
they
had
eaten
lying
on
the
dish
in
front
of
them
reminding
them
of
those
they
had
they
wanted
having
done
with
meringues
to
get
away
from
them
and
forget
them
they
wanted
to
go
into
another
room
now
where
there
were
any
felt
and
told
who
was
staring
listlessly
at
the
meringues
that
it
was
like
having
committed
murder
and
being
obliged
to
go
on
looking
at
the
body
long
after
you
were
thoroughly
tired
of
it
agreed
and
said
that
she
wished
now
she
had
committed
meringues
anyhow
so
many
of
them
then
at
last
edith
came
back
and
told
them
she
was
sure
they
were
very
tired
after
their
long
day
and
suggested
their
going
upstairs
to
their
rooms
the
rooms
were
ready
said
edith
the
baggage
had
come
and
she
was
sure
they
would
like
to
have
nice
hot
baths
and
go
to
bed
the
twins
obeyed
her
readily
and
she
checked
a
desire
on
their
part
to
seek
out
her
mother
and
brother
first
and
bid
them
on
the
ground
that
her
mother
and
brother
were
busy
and
while
the
twins
were
expressing
polite
regret
and
requesting
her
to
convey
their
regret
for
them
to
the
proper
quarter
in
a
flow
of
words
that
astonished
edith
who
did
know
how
naturally
junkers
make
speeches
she
hurried
them
by
the
door
through
which
shut
though
it
was
came
sounds
of
people
being
as
remarked
very
busy
indeed
and
impressed
by
the
quality
and
volume
of
mr
twist
voice
as
it
reached
her
passing
ears
told
edith
that
intimately
as
she
knew
her
brother
she
had
never
known
him
as
busy
as
that
before
edith
said
nothing
but
continued
quickly
up
the
stairs
they
found
they
each
had
a
bedroom
with
a
door
between
and
that
each
bedroom
had
a
bathroom
of
its
own
which
filled
them
with
admiration
and
pleasure
there
had
only
been
one
bathroom
at
uncle
arthur
and
at
home
in
pomerania
there
had
been
any
at
all
the
baths
there
had
been
vessels
brought
into
one
bedroom
every
night
into
which
servants
next
morning
poured
water
out
of
buckets
having
previously
pumped
the
water
into
the
bucket
from
the
pump
in
the
backyard
they
put
edith
in
possession
of
these
facts
while
she
helped
them
unpack
and
brushed
and
plaited
their
hair
for
them
and
she
was
much
astonished
both
at
the
conditions
of
discomfort
and
slavery
they
revealed
as
prevalent
in
other
countries
and
at
the
fact
that
they
the
twinklers
should
hail
from
pomerania
pomerania
reflected
edith
as
she
tied
up
their
pigtails
with
the
ribbons
handed
to
her
for
that
purpose
used
to
be
in
germany
when
she
went
to
school
and
no
doubt
still
was
she
became
more
thoughtful
than
ever
though
she
still
smiled
at
them
for
how
could
she
help
it
everyone
edith
was
certain
must
needs
smile
at
the
twinklers
even
if
they
did
happen
to
be
one
own
dear
brother
and
when
they
came
out
very
clean
and
with
scrubbed
pink
ears
from
their
bath
she
not
only
smiled
at
them
as
she
tucked
them
up
in
bed
but
she
kissed
them
edith
like
her
brother
was
born
to
be
a
mother
one
of
the
satisfactory
sort
that
keeps
you
warm
and
does
argue
with
you
germans
or
no
germans
the
twinklers
were
the
cutest
little
things
thought
edith
and
she
kissed
them
with
the
same
hunger
with
which
being
now
she
was
beginning
to
kiss
puppies
you
remind
me
so
of
mr
twist
murmured
sleepily
as
edith
tucked
her
up
and
kissed
her
you
do
all
the
sorts
of
things
he
does
murmured
also
sleepily
when
it
was
her
turn
to
be
tucked
up
and
kissed
and
in
spite
of
a
habit
now
fixed
in
her
of
unquestioning
acceptance
and
uncritical
faith
edith
went
downstairs
to
her
restless
vigil
outside
the
door
a
little
surprised
at
breakfast
the
twins
learnt
to
their
astonishment
that
though
appearances
all
pointed
the
other
way
what
they
were
really
doing
was
not
being
stationary
at
all
but
merely
having
a
night
lodging
and
breakfast
between
as
it
were
two
trains
mr
twist
who
looked
pale
and
said
shortly
when
the
twins
remarked
solicitously
on
it
that
he
felt
pale
briefly
announced
the
fact
what
exclaimed
staring
at
mr
twist
and
then
at
edith
mrs
twist
they
were
told
was
breakfasting
in
bed
why
unpacked
you
will
said
mr
twist
they
found
difficulty
in
believing
their
ears
but
we
settled
in
remonstrated
after
an
astonished
pause
you
will
settle
out
said
mr
twist
he
frowned
he
did
look
at
them
he
frowned
at
his
own
teapot
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
very
short
with
the
annas
until
they
were
safely
out
of
the
house
and
not
permit
himself
to
be
entangled
by
them
in
controversy
also
he
did
want
to
look
at
them
if
he
could
help
it
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
did
he
might
be
unable
not
to
take
them
both
in
his
arms
and
beg
their
pardon
for
the
whole
horridness
of
the
world
but
if
he
did
look
at
them
they
looked
at
him
four
round
blankly
surprised
eyes
were
fixed
he
knew
unblinkingly
on
him
we
seeing
you
in
quite
a
new
light
said
at
last
troubled
and
upset
maybe
said
mr
twist
frowning
at
his
teapot
perhaps
you
will
be
so
good
said
stiffly
for
at
all
times
she
hated
being
stirred
up
and
uprooted
as
to
tell
us
where
you
think
we
going
to
because
said
her
voice
trembling
a
little
not
only
at
the
thought
of
fresh
responsibilities
but
also
with
a
sense
of
outraged
faith
our
choice
of
residence
as
you
may
have
observed
is
strictly
limited
mr
twist
who
had
spent
an
hour
before
breakfast
with
edith
whose
eyes
were
red
informed
them
that
they
were
for
california
to
those
other
people
said
i
see
she
held
her
head
up
straight
well
i
expect
they
be
very
glad
to
see
us
she
said
after
a
silence
and
proceeded
her
chin
in
the
air
to
look
down
her
nose
because
she
did
want
mr
twist
or
edith
or
to
notice
that
her
eyes
had
gone
and
got
tears
in
them
she
angrily
wished
she
had
got
such
damp
eyes
they
were
no
better
than
swamps
she
thought
undrained
swamps
and
directly
fate
foot
came
down
a
little
harder
than
usual
up
oozed
the
lamentable
liquid
not
thus
should
the
leader
of
an
expedition
behave
not
thus
she
was
sure
did
the
original
christopher
she
pulled
herself
together
and
after
a
minute
struggle
was
able
to
leave
off
looking
down
her
nose
but
meanwhile
had
informed
mr
twist
with
gentle
dignity
that
he
was
obviously
tired
of
them
not
at
all
said
mr
twist
persisted
in
view
of
the
facts
she
said
gently
afraid
your
denial
carries
no
weight
the
facts
said
mr
twist
taking
up
his
teapot
and
examining
it
with
care
are
that
i
coming
with
you
oh
are
you
said
much
more
briskly
and
it
was
here
that
eyes
dried
up
that
rather
dishes
your
theory
said
mr
twist
still
turning
his
teapot
about
in
his
hands
or
would
if
it
did
happen
that
i
well
i
happen
to
have
some
business
to
do
in
california
and
i
may
as
well
do
it
now
as
later
still
i
could
have
gone
by
a
different
route
or
train
so
you
see
your
theory
rather
dished
is
it
a
little
admitted
not
altogether
because
if
you
really
like
our
being
here
here
we
are
so
why
hurry
us
off
somewhere
else
so
soon
mr
twist
perceived
that
he
was
being
led
into
controversy
in
spite
of
his
determination
not
to
be
you
very
wise
he
said
shortly
but
you
do
know
everything
let
us
avoid
conjecture
and
stick
to
facts
i
going
to
take
you
to
california
and
hand
you
over
to
your
friends
that
all
you
know
and
all
you
need
to
know
as
keats
very
nearly
said
said
and
if
our
friends
have
run
away
suggested
oh
lord
exclaimed
mr
twist
impatiently
putting
the
teapot
down
with
a
bang
do
you
think
we
running
away
all
the
time
in
america
well
i
think
you
seem
a
little
restless
said
thus
it
was
that
two
hours
later
the
twins
found
themselves
at
the
clark
station
once
more
once
more
starting
into
the
unknown
just
as
if
they
had
never
done
it
before
and
gradually
as
they
adapted
themselves
to
the
sudden
change
such
is
the
quality
of
youth
almost
with
the
same
hopefulness
yet
they
could
but
meditate
left
alone
on
the
platform
while
mr
twist
checked
the
baggage
on
the
mutability
of
life
they
seemed
to
live
in
a
kaleidoscope
since
the
war
began
what
a
series
of
upheavals
and
readjustments
had
been
theirs
silent
and
a
little
apart
on
the
clark
platform
they
reflected
retrospectively
and
as
they
counted
up
their
various
starts
since
the
days
only
fourteen
months
ago
when
they
were
still
in
their
home
in
germany
apparently
as
safely
rooted
as
unshakably
settled
as
the
pine
trees
in
their
own
forests
they
could
but
wonder
at
the
elusiveness
of
the
unknown
how
it
would
let
itself
be
caught
up
with
and
at
the
trouble
it
was
giving
them
they
had
had
so
many
changes
in
the
last
year
that
they
did
want
now
to
have
time
to
become
familiar
with
some
one
place
and
people
already
however
being
seventeen
they
were
telling
themselves
and
each
other
that
after
all
since
the
sacks
had
failed
them
california
was
their
real
objective
not
clark
at
all
clark
had
never
been
part
of
their
plans
uncle
arthur
and
aunt
alice
did
even
know
it
existed
it
was
a
just
a
little
thing
of
their
own
an
extra
excursion
slipped
in
between
the
sacks
and
the
delloggs
true
they
had
hoped
to
stay
there
some
time
perhaps
even
for
months
anyhow
time
to
mend
their
stockings
in
which
were
giving
way
at
the
toes
unexpectedly
seeing
how
new
they
were
but
ultimately
california
was
the
place
they
had
to
go
to
it
was
only
that
it
was
a
little
upsetting
to
be
whisked
out
of
clark
at
a
moment
notice
i
expect
you
explain
everything
to
us
when
we
in
the
train
and
have
lots
of
time
had
said
to
mr
twist
as
the
car
moved
away
from
the
house
and
edith
waved
her
handkerchief
from
the
doorstep
mrs
twist
had
not
come
down
to
say
and
they
had
sent
her
many
messages
i
expect
i
will
mr
twist
had
answered
but
it
was
not
till
they
were
the
other
side
of
chicago
that
he
really
began
to
be
himself
again
up
to
then
all
that
first
day
and
the
next
morning
in
new
york
where
he
took
them
to
the
bank
their
was
in
and
saw
that
they
got
a
and
all
the
day
after
that
waiting
in
the
chicago
hotel
for
the
train
they
were
to
go
on
in
to
california
mr
twist
was
taciturn
they
left
chicago
in
the
evening
a
raw
wintery
october
evening
with
cold
rain
in
the
air
and
the
twins
going
early
to
bed
in
their
compartment
a
place
that
seemed
to
them
so
enchanting
that
their
spirits
could
fail
to
rise
saw
no
more
of
him
till
breakfast
next
morning
they
then
noticed
that
the
cloud
had
lifted
a
little
and
as
the
day
went
on
it
lifted
still
more
they
were
going
to
be
three
days
together
in
that
train
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
mr
twist
they
were
sure
to
go
on
being
taciturn
as
long
as
that
it
was
his
nature
his
nature
was
conversational
and
besides
shut
up
like
that
in
a
train
the
sheer
getting
tired
of
reading
all
day
would
make
him
want
to
talk
so
after
lunch
when
they
were
all
three
on
the
platform
of
the
observation
car
though
there
was
nothing
to
observe
except
limitless
flat
stretches
of
bleak
and
empty
country
the
twins
suggested
that
he
should
now
begin
to
talk
again
they
pointed
out
that
his
body
was
bound
to
get
stiff
on
that
long
journey
from
want
of
exercise
but
that
his
mind
need
and
he
had
better
stretch
it
by
conversing
agreeably
with
them
as
he
used
to
before
the
day
which
seemed
so
curiously
long
ago
when
they
landed
in
america
it
does
indeed
seem
long
ago
agreed
mr
twist
lighting
another
cigarette
i
have
difficulty
in
realizing
it
is
a
week
yet
and
he
reflected
that
the
annas
had
managed
to
produce
pretty
serious
havoc
in
america
considering
they
had
only
been
in
it
five
days
he
and
his
mother
permanently
estranged
edith
left
alone
at
clark
sitting
there
in
the
ruins
of
her
loving
preparations
for
his
return
with
nothing
at
all
that
he
could
see
to
look
forward
to
and
live
for
except
the
hourly
fulfilment
of
what
she
regarded
as
duty
every
plan
upset
the
lives
indeed
of
his
mother
and
of
his
sister
and
of
himself
completely
altered
it
was
a
pretty
big
bag
in
the
time
he
thought
flinging
the
match
back
towards
chicago
mr
twist
felt
sore
he
felt
like
somebody
who
had
had
a
bad
tumble
and
is
sore
and
a
little
dizzy
but
he
recognized
that
these
great
ruptures
can
not
take
place
without
aches
and
doubts
he
ached
and
he
doubted
and
he
also
knew
through
his
aches
and
doubts
that
he
was
free
at
last
from
what
of
late
years
he
had
so
grievously
writhed
under
the
shame
of
pretence
and
the
immediate
cause
of
his
being
set
free
was
precisely
the
annas
it
had
been
a
violent
a
painful
setting
free
but
it
had
happened
and
who
knew
if
without
their
sudden
appearance
at
clark
and
the
immediate
effect
they
produced
on
his
mother
he
would
have
lapsed
after
all
in
spite
of
the
feelings
and
determinations
he
had
brought
back
with
him
from
europe
into
the
old
ways
again
under
the
old
influence
and
gone
on
ignobly
pretending
to
agree
to
approve
to
enjoy
to
love
when
he
was
never
for
an
instant
doing
anything
of
the
sort
he
might
have
trailed
on
like
that
for
years
mr
twist
did
like
the
picture
of
his
own
weakness
but
he
was
determined
to
look
at
himself
as
he
was
trailed
along
languidly
when
he
was
at
home
living
another
life
when
he
was
away
getting
what
he
absolutely
must
have
the
irreducible
minimum
of
personal
freedom
necessary
to
sanity
by
means
of
small
and
shabby
deceits
my
goodness
how
he
hated
deceits
how
tired
he
was
of
the
littleness
of
them
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
the
profiles
of
the
annas
sitting
alongside
him
his
heart
suddenly
grew
warm
within
him
they
had
on
the
blue
caps
again
which
made
them
look
so
bald
and
cherubic
and
their
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
straight
narrowing
lines
of
rails
that
went
back
and
back
to
a
point
in
the
distance
the
dear
little
things
the
dear
dear
little
things
so
straightforward
so
blessedly
straight
and
simple
thought
mr
twist
fancy
his
mother
losing
a
chance
like
this
fancy
thought
the
affectionate
and
kind
man
missing
an
opportunity
of
helping
such
unfortunately
placed
children
the
twins
felt
he
was
looking
at
them
and
together
they
turned
and
looked
at
him
when
they
saw
his
expression
they
knew
the
cloud
had
lifted
still
more
and
their
faces
broke
into
broad
smiles
of
welcome
it
pleasant
to
see
you
back
again
said
heartily
who
was
next
to
him
we
missed
you
very
much
said
it
has
been
like
the
same
place
the
world
has
said
since
you
been
away
since
you
walked
out
of
the
that
night
at
clark
said
of
course
we
know
you
ca
always
be
with
us
said
which
we
deeply
regret
interjected
but
while
you
are
with
us
said
for
these
last
few
days
i
would
suggest
that
we
should
be
happy
as
happy
as
we
used
to
be
on
the
when
we
were
being
and
she
thought
she
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
enjoy
hearing
the
ode
to
dooty
now
yes
said
leaning
forward
in
three
days
we
shall
have
disappeared
into
the
maw
of
the
delloggs
do
let
us
be
happy
while
we
can
who
knows
what
their
maw
will
be
like
but
whatever
it
like
she
added
firmly
we
going
to
stick
in
it
and
perhaps
said
now
that
you
a
little
restored
to
your
normal
condition
you
tell
us
what
has
been
the
matter
for
it
quite
clear
said
that
something
been
the
matter
we
been
talking
it
over
said
and
putting
two
and
two
together
and
perhaps
you
tell
us
what
it
was
and
then
we
shall
know
if
we
right
perhaps
i
will
said
mr
twist
cogitating
as
he
continued
benevolently
to
gaze
at
them
let
see
he
hesitated
and
pushed
his
hat
off
his
forehead
i
wonder
if
you
understand
we
give
our
minds
to
it
assured
him
these
caps
make
us
look
more
stupid
than
we
are
assured
him
deducing
her
own
appearance
from
that
of
encouraged
but
doubtful
of
their
capabilities
of
comprehension
on
this
particular
point
mr
twist
embarked
rather
gingerly
on
his
explanations
he
was
going
to
be
candid
from
now
on
for
the
rest
of
his
days
but
the
preliminary
plunges
were
he
found
after
all
a
little
difficult
even
with
the
pellucidly
candid
annas
all
ready
with
ears
pricked
up
attentively
and
benevolently
and
minds
impartial
he
found
it
difficult
it
was
because
on
the
subject
of
mothers
he
feared
he
was
up
against
their
one
prejudice
he
felt
rather
than
knew
that
their
attitude
on
this
one
point
might
be
uncompromising
mothers
were
mothers
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
that
sort
of
attitude
coupled
with
extreme
reprobation
of
himself
for
supposing
anything
else
he
was
surprised
and
relieved
to
find
he
was
wrong
directly
they
got
wind
of
the
line
his
explanations
were
taking
which
was
very
soon
for
they
were
giving
their
minds
to
it
as
they
promised
and
mr
hesitations
were
illuminating
they
interrupted
so
we
were
right
they
said
to
each
other
but
you
do
know
yet
what
i
going
to
say
said
mr
twist
only
started
on
the
preliminaries
yes
we
do
you
fell
out
with
your
mother
said
quarrelled
said
nodding
we
did
think
so
at
the
time
said
we
just
felt
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
strain
about
clark
said
but
talking
it
over
privately
we
concluded
that
was
what
had
happened
mr
twist
was
so
much
surprised
that
for
a
moment
he
could
only
say
oh
then
he
said
and
you
terribly
shocked
i
suppose
oh
no
they
said
airily
and
together
no
you
see
began
you
see
began
you
see
as
a
general
principle
said
reprehensible
to
quarrel
with
one
mother
but
we
not
been
able
to
escape
observing
said
in
the
course
of
our
brief
and
inglorious
career
put
in
that
there
are
mothers
and
mothers
said
yes
said
mr
twist
and
as
they
did
go
on
he
presently
added
yes
oh
that
all
said
the
twins
once
more
airily
and
together
chapter
xix
after
this
brief
the
rest
of
the
journey
was
happy
indeed
it
is
doubtful
if
any
one
can
journey
to
california
and
not
be
happy
mr
twist
had
never
been
further
west
than
chicago
and
break
up
or
no
break
up
of
his
home
he
could
but
have
a
pleasant
feeling
of
adventure
every
now
and
then
the
realization
of
this
feeling
gave
his
conscience
a
twinge
and
wrung
out
of
it
a
rebuke
he
was
having
the
best
of
it
in
this
business
he
was
the
party
in
the
quarrel
who
went
away
who
left
the
dreariness
of
the
scene
of
battle
with
all
its
corpses
of
dead
illusions
and
got
off
to
fresh
places
and
people
who
had
never
heard
of
him
just
being
in
a
train
he
found
and
rushing
on
to
somewhere
else
was
extraordinarily
at
clark
there
would
be
gloom
and
stagnation
the
heavy
brooding
of
a
storm
that
has
burst
but
not
moved
on
a
continued
anger
on
his
mother
side
naturally
increasing
with
her
inactivity
with
her
impotence
he
was
gone
and
she
could
say
and
do
nothing
more
to
him
in
a
quarrel
thought
mr
twist
the
morning
he
pushed
up
his
blinds
and
saw
the
desert
at
sunrise
an
exquisite
soft
thing
just
being
touched
into
faint
colours
in
a
quarrel
the
one
who
goes
has
quite
unfairly
the
best
of
it
beautiful
new
places
come
and
laugh
at
him
people
who
do
know
him
and
have
yet
judged
and
condemned
him
are
ready
to
be
friendly
he
must
of
course
go
far
enough
not
stay
near
at
hand
in
some
familiar
place
and
be
so
lonely
that
he
ends
by
being
remorseful
well
he
was
going
far
enough
thanks
to
the
annas
he
was
going
about
as
far
as
he
could
go
certainly
he
was
having
the
best
of
it
in
being
the
one
in
the
quarrel
who
went
and
he
was
shocked
to
find
himself
cynically
thinking
on
top
of
that
that
one
should
always
then
take
care
to
be
the
one
who
did
go
but
the
desert
has
a
peculiarly
exhilarating
air
it
came
in
everywhere
and
seemed
to
tickle
him
out
of
the
uneasy
mood
proper
to
one
who
has
been
cutting
himself
off
for
good
and
all
from
his
early
home
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
help
feeling
extraordinarily
light
and
free
edith
yes
there
was
edith
but
some
day
he
would
make
up
to
edith
for
everything
there
was
no
helping
her
now
she
was
fast
bound
in
misery
and
iron
and
did
even
seem
to
know
it
so
would
he
have
been
he
supposed
if
he
had
never
left
home
at
all
as
it
was
it
was
bound
to
come
this
upheaval
just
the
mere
fact
of
inevitable
growth
would
have
burst
the
bands
sooner
or
later
there
ought
of
course
to
have
been
any
bands
or
there
being
bands
he
ought
long
ago
to
have
burst
them
he
pulled
his
kind
slack
mouth
firmly
together
and
looked
determined
long
ago
repeated
mr
twist
shaking
his
head
at
his
own
weak
past
well
it
was
done
at
last
and
never
again
never
never
again
he
said
to
himself
sniffing
in
through
his
open
window
the
cold
air
of
the
desert
at
sunrise
by
that
route
the
santa
fé
it
is
not
till
two
or
three
hours
before
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
journey
that
summer
meets
you
it
is
waiting
for
you
at
a
place
called
san
bernardino
there
is
no
trace
of
it
before
up
to
then
you
are
still
in
october
and
then
you
get
to
the
top
of
the
pass
and
with
a
burst
it
is
june
brilliant
windless
the
twins
and
mr
twist
were
in
the
lunching
when
the
miracle
happened
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
in
came
summer
with
a
great
warm
breath
of
roses
in
a
moment
the
car
was
invaded
by
the
scent
of
flowers
and
fruit
and
of
something
else
strange
and
new
and
very
aromatic
the
electric
fans
were
set
twirling
the
black
waiters
began
to
perspire
the
passengers
called
for
cold
things
to
eat
and
the
twins
pulled
off
their
knitted
caps
and
jerseys
from
that
point
on
to
the
end
of
the
line
in
los
angeles
the
twins
could
only
conclude
they
were
in
heaven
it
was
the
light
that
did
it
the
extraordinary
glow
of
radiance
of
course
there
were
orchards
after
orchards
of
orange
trees
covered
with
fruit
white
houses
smothered
in
flowers
gardens
overrun
with
roses
tall
groups
of
eucalyptus
trees
giving
an
impression
of
elegant
nakedness
long
lines
of
pepper
trees
with
frail
branches
and
these
things
continued
for
the
rest
of
the
way
but
they
would
have
been
as
nothing
without
that
beautiful
great
bland
light
the
twins
had
had
their
hot
summers
in
pomerania
and
their
july
days
in
england
but
had
not
yet
seen
anything
like
this
here
was
summer
without
sultriness
without
gnats
mosquitoes
threatening
thunderstorms
or
anything
to
spoil
it
it
was
summer
as
it
might
be
in
the
elysian
fields
perfectly
clear
and
calm
and
radiant
when
the
train
stopped
they
could
see
how
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
dust
on
the
quiet
white
roads
and
the
leaves
of
the
magnolia
trees
glistened
motionless
in
the
sun
the
train
went
slowly
and
stopped
often
for
there
seemed
to
be
one
long
succession
of
gardens
and
villages
after
the
empty
plains
they
had
come
through
those
vast
cold
expanses
without
a
house
or
living
creature
in
sight
what
a
laughing
plenty
what
a
gracious
fruitfulness
was
here
and
when
they
went
back
to
their
compartment
it
too
was
full
of
summer
smells
the
smell
of
fruit
and
roses
and
honey
for
the
first
time
since
the
war
began
and
with
it
their
wanderings
the
twins
felt
completely
happy
it
was
as
though
the
loveliness
wrapped
them
round
and
they
stretched
themselves
in
it
and
forgot
no
fear
of
the
future
no
doubt
of
it
at
all
they
thought
gazing
out
of
the
window
the
soft
air
patting
their
faces
could
possibly
bother
them
here
they
never
for
instance
could
be
cold
here
or
go
hungry
a
great
confidence
in
life
invaded
them
the
delloggs
and
for
years
in
this
place
could
but
be
gentle
too
and
kind
and
calm
impossible
not
to
get
a
sort
of
refulgence
oneself
they
thought
living
here
and
absorb
it
and
give
it
out
again
they
pictured
the
delloggs
as
bland
pillars
of
light
coming
forward
effulgently
to
greet
them
and
bathing
them
in
the
beams
of
their
hospitality
and
the
feeling
of
responsibility
and
anxiety
that
had
never
left
since
she
last
saw
aunt
alice
dropped
off
her
in
this
place
and
she
felt
that
sun
and
oranges
backed
by
in
the
bank
would
be
difficult
things
for
misfortune
to
get
at
as
for
mr
twist
he
was
even
more
entranced
than
the
twins
as
he
gazed
out
of
the
window
for
being
older
he
had
had
time
to
see
more
ugly
things
had
got
more
used
to
them
and
to
taking
them
as
principally
making
up
life
he
stared
at
what
he
saw
and
thought
with
wonder
of
his
mother
at
clark
of
its
gloomy
discomforts
of
the
cold
mist
creeping
round
the
house
and
of
that
last
scene
in
it
with
her
black
figure
in
the
middle
of
it
tall
and
thin
and
shaking
with
bitterness
he
had
certainly
been
in
that
and
heard
her
so
terribly
denouncing
him
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
believe
it
seemed
so
exactly
like
a
nightmare
and
this
the
happy
normal
waking
up
in
the
morning
they
all
three
were
in
the
highest
spirits
when
they
got
out
at
los
angeles
and
drove
across
to
the
southern
pacific
station
the
name
alone
made
their
hearts
leap
to
catch
the
afternoon
train
on
to
where
the
delloggs
lived
and
their
spirits
were
the
kind
one
can
imagine
in
released
souls
on
their
first
arriving
in
paradise
high
yet
subdued
happy
but
reverential
a
sort
of
rollicking
awe
they
were
subdued
in
fact
by
beauty
and
the
journey
along
the
edge
of
the
pacific
to
acapulco
where
the
delloggs
lived
encouraged
and
developed
this
kind
of
spirits
for
the
sun
began
to
set
and
as
the
train
ran
for
miles
close
to
the
water
with
nothing
but
a
strip
of
sand
between
it
and
the
surf
they
saw
their
first
pacific
sunset
it
happened
to
be
even
in
that
land
of
wonderful
sunsets
an
unusually
wonderful
one
and
none
of
the
three
had
ever
seen
anything
in
the
least
like
it
they
could
but
sit
silent
and
stare
the
great
sea
that
little
line
of
lovely
islands
flung
down
on
it
like
a
chain
of
amethysts
that
vast
flame
of
sky
that
heaving
water
passionately
reflecting
it
and
on
the
other
side
through
the
other
windows
a
sharp
wall
of
black
mountains
it
was
fantastically
beautiful
like
something
in
a
poem
or
a
dream
by
the
time
they
got
to
acapulco
it
was
dark
night
followed
upon
the
sunset
with
a
suddenness
that
astonished
the
twins
used
to
the
leisurely
methods
of
twilight
on
the
baltic
and
the
only
light
in
the
country
outside
the
town
as
they
got
near
it
was
the
light
from
myriads
of
great
stars
no
delloggs
were
at
the
station
but
the
twins
were
used
now
to
not
being
met
and
had
not
particularly
expected
them
besides
mr
twist
was
with
them
this
time
and
he
would
see
that
if
the
delloggs
did
come
to
them
they
would
get
safely
to
the
delloggs
the
usual
telegram
had
been
sent
announcing
their
arrival
and
the
who
seemed
to
know
the
dellogg
house
well
when
mr
twist
told
him
where
they
wanted
to
go
apparently
also
thought
it
natural
they
should
want
to
go
exactly
there
in
him
indeed
there
did
seem
to
be
a
trace
of
expecting
them
almost
as
if
he
had
been
told
to
look
out
for
them
for
hardly
had
mr
twist
begun
to
give
him
the
address
than
glancing
at
the
twins
he
said
i
guess
you
wanting
dellogg
and
got
down
and
actually
opened
the
door
for
them
an
attention
so
unusual
in
the
the
twins
had
up
to
then
met
in
america
that
they
were
more
than
ever
convinced
that
nothing
in
the
way
of
unfriendliness
or
unkindness
could
stand
up
against
sun
and
oranges
relations
he
asked
them
through
the
window
as
he
shut
the
door
gently
and
carefully
while
mr
twist
went
with
a
porter
to
see
about
the
luggage
i
beg
your
pardon
said
relations
of
delloggses
no
said
friends
at
least
amended
practically
ah
said
the
driver
leaning
with
both
his
arms
on
the
in
the
friendliest
possible
manner
and
chewing
gum
and
eyeing
them
with
thoughtful
interest
then
he
said
after
a
pause
during
which
his
jaw
rolled
regularly
from
side
to
side
and
the
twins
watched
the
rolling
with
an
interest
equal
to
his
interest
in
them
from
los
angeles
no
said
from
new
york
at
least
amended
practically
well
i
call
that
a
real
compliment
said
the
driver
slowly
and
deliberately
because
of
his
jaw
going
on
rolling
to
come
all
that
way
and
without
being
relations
i
call
that
a
real
compliment
and
a
friendship
that
worth
something
anybody
can
come
along
from
los
angeles
but
it
takes
a
real
friend
to
come
from
new
york
and
he
eyed
them
now
with
admiration
the
twins
for
their
part
eyed
him
not
only
did
his
rolling
jaws
fascinate
them
but
the
things
he
was
saying
seemed
to
them
quaint
but
we
wanted
to
come
said
after
a
pause
of
course
does
you
credit
said
the
driver
the
twins
thought
this
over
the
bright
station
lights
shone
on
their
faces
which
stood
out
very
white
in
the
black
setting
of
their
best
mourning
before
getting
to
los
angeles
they
had
dressed
themselves
carefully
in
what
called
their
garments
those
garments
aunt
alice
had
bought
for
them
on
their
mother
death
expressing
the
wave
of
sympathy
in
which
she
found
herself
momentarily
engulfed
by
going
to
a
very
good
and
expensive
dressmaker
and
in
the
black
perfection
of
these
clothes
the
twins
looked
like
two
and
very
attractive
young
crows
these
were
the
clothes
they
had
put
on
on
leaving
the
ship
and
had
been
so
obviously
admired
in
to
the
uneasiness
of
mr
twist
by
the
public
it
was
in
these
clothes
that
they
had
arrived
within
range
of
sack
distracted
but
still
appreciative
vision
and
in
them
that
they
later
roused
the
suspicions
and
dislike
of
mrs
twist
it
was
in
these
clothes
that
they
were
now
about
to
start
what
they
hoped
would
be
a
lasting
friendship
with
the
delloggs
and
remembering
they
had
them
on
they
decided
that
perhaps
it
was
only
sun
and
oranges
making
the
so
attentive
but
also
the
effect
on
him
of
their
and
hats
this
was
confirmed
by
what
he
said
next
i
guess
you
old
friends
then
he
remarked
after
a
period
of
reflective
must
be
to
come
all
that
way
well
not
exactly
said
divided
between
her
respect
for
truth
and
her
gratification
at
being
thought
old
enough
to
be
old
friend
you
see
explained
who
was
never
divided
in
her
respect
for
truth
we
not
particularly
old
anything
the
driver
in
his
turn
thought
this
over
and
finding
he
had
no
observations
he
wished
to
make
on
it
he
let
it
pass
and
said
miss
mr
dellogg
oh
said
pricking
up
her
ears
shall
we
we
do
mind
missing
dellogg
said
it
dellogg
we
would
like
to
miss
the
driver
looked
puzzled
yes
that
would
be
too
awful
said
who
did
want
a
repetition
of
the
sack
dilemma
you
did
say
she
asked
anxiously
did
you
that
we
were
going
to
miss
mr
dellogg
the
driver
looking
first
at
one
of
them
and
then
at
the
other
said
well
and
who
would
and
this
answer
seemed
so
odd
to
the
twins
that
they
could
only
as
they
stared
at
him
suppose
it
was
some
recondite
form
of
american
slang
provided
with
its
own
particular
repartee
which
being
unacquainted
with
the
language
they
were
not
in
a
position
to
supply
perhaps
they
thought
it
was
of
the
same
order
of
mysterious
idioms
as
in
england
such
sentences
as
i
do
think
and
not
half
forms
of
speech
whose
exact
meaning
and
proper
use
had
never
been
mastered
by
them
there
wo
be
another
like
dellogg
in
these
parts
for
many
a
year
said
the
driver
shaking
his
head
ah
no
and
that
so
is
he
coming
back
asked
the
driver
jaws
ceased
for
a
moment
to
roll
he
stared
at
with
unblinking
eyes
then
he
turned
his
head
away
and
spat
along
the
station
and
then
again
fixing
his
eyes
on
he
said
young
gurl
you
may
be
a
spiritualist
and
a
and
a
and
a
and
anything
else
you
please
and
get
what
comfort
you
can
out
of
your
coming
backs
and
the
rest
of
the
blessed
truck
but
i
know
better
and
what
i
know
being
a
christian
is
that
once
a
man
dead
he
either
in
heaven
or
he
in
hell
and
whichever
it
is
he
in
in
it
he
stops
was
the
first
to
speak
are
we
to
understand
she
inquired
that
dellogg
she
broke
off
that
dellogg
is
continued
for
her
but
broke
off
too
that
dellogg
is
resumed
with
determination
well
that
he
is
alive
alive
repeated
the
driver
he
let
his
hand
drop
heavily
on
the
if
that
do
beat
all
he
said
staring
at
her
what
do
you
come
his
funeral
for
then
his
funeral
yes
if
you
do
know
that
he
ai
ai
is
what
alive
of
course
no
i
mean
dead
you
getting
me
all
tangled
up
but
we
have
but
we
did
we
had
a
letter
from
him
only
last
month
at
least
an
uncle
we
got
had
and
he
did
say
a
word
in
it
about
being
dead
i
mean
there
was
no
sign
of
his
being
going
to
be
i
mean
he
was
a
bit
ill
or
anything
in
his
letter
now
see
here
interrupted
the
driver
sarcasm
in
his
voice
it
exactly
usual
is
it
i
put
it
to
you
squarely
and
say
it
usual
there
may
be
exceptions
but
it
ai
exactly
to
come
to
a
gentleman
funeral
and
especially
not
all
the
way
from
new
york
without
some
sort
of
an
idea
that
he
dead
some
sort
of
a
idea
anyhow
he
added
still
more
sarcastically
for
his
admiration
for
the
twins
had
given
way
to
doubt
and
discomfort
and
a
suspicion
was
growing
on
him
that
with
incredible
and
horrible
levity
seeing
what
the
moment
was
and
what
the
occasion
they
were
filling
up
the
time
waiting
for
their
baggage
among
which
were
no
doubt
funeral
wreaths
by
making
game
of
him
gurls
like
you
should
behave
that
way
he
went
on
his
voice
aggrieved
as
he
remembered
how
sympathetically
he
had
got
down
from
his
seat
when
he
saw
their
mourning
clothes
and
tired
white
faces
and
helped
them
into
his
taxi
only
for
genuine
mourners
real
sorry
ones
going
to
pay
their
last
respects
to
a
gentleman
like
dellogg
would
he
a
free
american
have
done
that
nicely
dressed
gurls
for
gurls
daughters
of
decent
people
here
you
come
all
this
way
i
guess
sent
by
your
parents
to
represent
them
properly
and
properly
fitted
out
in
nice
black
clothes
and
all
and
you
start
making
fun
pretending
playing
kind
of
with
me
about
the
funeral
messing
me
up
in
a
lot
of
words
i
do
like
it
i
a
father
myself
and
i
like
it
i
do
like
to
see
daughters
going
on
like
this
when
their
father
ai
looking
it
do
seem
decent
to
me
but
i
suppose
you
easterners
the
twins
however
were
not
listening
they
were
looking
at
each
other
in
dismay
how
extraordinary
how
terrible
the
way
uncle
friends
gave
out
they
seemed
to
melt
away
at
one
mere
approach
people
who
had
been
living
with
their
husbands
all
their
lives
ran
away
just
as
the
twins
came
on
the
scene
people
who
had
been
alive
all
their
lives
went
and
died
also
at
that
very
moment
it
almost
seemed
as
if
directly
anybody
knew
that
they
the
twinklers
were
coming
to
stay
with
them
they
became
bent
on
escape
they
could
only
look
at
each
other
in
stricken
astonishment
at
this
latest
blow
of
fate
they
heard
no
more
of
what
the
driver
said
they
could
only
sit
and
look
at
each
other
and
then
mr
twist
came
hurrying
across
from
the
baggage
office
wiping
his
forehead
for
the
night
was
hot
behind
him
came
the
porter
ruefully
balancing
the
grips
on
his
truck
i
sorry
to
have
been
so
began
mr
twist
smiling
cheerfully
but
he
stopped
short
in
his
sentence
and
left
off
smiling
when
he
saw
the
expression
in
the
four
eyes
fixed
on
him
what
has
happened
he
asked
quickly
only
what
we
might
have
expected
said
dellogg
dead
said
you
do
say
said
mr
twist
and
after
a
pause
he
said
again
you
do
say
then
he
recovered
himself
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
of
course
he
said
briskly
picking
himself
up
as
it
were
from
this
sudden
and
unexpected
tumble
but
i
do
see
that
it
matters
to
you
so
long
as
dellogg
is
dead
too
yes
but
began
dellogg
is
dead
you
see
said
mr
twist
looked
from
them
to
the
driver
but
finding
no
elucidation
there
and
only
disapproval
looked
back
again
he
is
dead
and
settled
said
not
sort
of
being
dead
said
he
dead
just
got
to
the
stage
when
he
has
a
funeral
said
his
funeral
it
seems
is
imminent
said
did
you
not
give
us
to
understand
she
asked
turning
to
the
driver
that
it
was
imminent
i
do
know
about
imminent
said
the
driver
who
was
going
to
waste
valuable
time
with
words
like
that
but
it
and
you
see
what
that
means
for
us
said
turning
to
mr
twist
mr
twist
did
he
again
wiped
his
forehead
but
not
this
time
because
the
night
was
hot
chapter
xx
manifestly
it
is
impossible
to
thrust
oneself
into
a
house
where
there
is
going
to
be
a
funeral
next
day
even
if
one
has
come
all
the
way
from
new
york
and
has
nowhere
else
to
go
equally
manifestly
it
is
impossible
to
thrust
oneself
into
it
after
the
funeral
till
a
decent
interval
has
elapsed
but
what
the
devil
mr
twist
asked
himself
in
language
become
regrettably
natural
to
him
since
his
sojourn
at
the
front
is
a
decent
interval
this
mr
twist
asked
himself
late
that
night
pacing
up
and
down
the
in
the
warm
and
tranquil
darkness
in
front
of
the
cosmopolitan
hotel
while
the
twins
utterly
tired
out
by
their
journey
and
the
emotions
at
the
end
of
it
crept
silently
into
bed
how
long
does
it
take
a
widow
to
recover
her
composure
recover
that
is
the
first
beginnings
of
it
at
what
stage
in
her
mourning
is
it
legitimate
to
intrude
on
her
with
reminders
of
obligations
incurred
before
she
was
a
widow
with
in
fact
the
twinklers
delicacy
itself
would
shrink
from
doing
it
under
a
week
thought
mr
twist
or
even
under
a
fortnight
or
even
if
you
came
to
that
under
a
month
and
meanwhile
what
was
he
to
do
with
the
twinklers
mr
twist
being
of
the
artistic
temperament
for
otherwise
he
have
been
so
sympathetic
nor
would
he
have
minded
as
he
so
passionately
did
mind
his
uncle
charles
teapot
dribbling
on
to
the
tablecloth
was
sometimes
swept
by
brief
but
tempestuous
revulsions
of
feeling
and
though
he
loved
the
twinklers
he
did
at
this
moment
describe
them
mentally
and
without
knowing
it
in
the
very
words
of
uncle
arthur
as
those
accursed
twins
it
was
quite
unjust
he
knew
they
could
help
the
death
of
the
man
dellogg
they
were
the
victims
from
first
to
last
of
a
cruel
and
pursuing
fate
but
it
is
natural
to
turn
on
victims
and
mr
twist
was
for
an
instant
out
of
the
very
depth
of
his
helpless
sympathy
impatient
with
the
twinklers
he
walked
up
and
down
the
sands
frowning
and
pulling
his
mouth
together
while
the
pacific
sighed
sympathetically
at
his
feet
across
the
road
the
huge
hotel
standing
in
its
gardens
was
pierced
by
a
thousand
lights
very
few
people
were
about
and
no
one
at
all
was
on
the
sands
there
was
an
immense
noise
of
what
sounded
like
grasshoppers
or
crickets
and
also
at
intervals
distant
choruses
of
frogs
but
these
sounds
seemed
altogether
beneficent
so
warm
and
southern
and
far
away
from
less
happy
places
where
in
october
cold
winds
perpetually
torment
the
world
even
in
the
dark
mr
twist
knew
he
had
got
to
somewhere
that
was
beautiful
he
could
imagine
nothing
more
agreeable
than
having
handed
over
the
twins
safely
to
the
delloggs
staying
on
a
week
or
two
in
this
place
and
seeing
them
every
day
perhaps
even
as
he
had
pictured
to
himself
on
the
journey
being
invited
to
stay
with
the
delloggs
now
all
that
was
knocked
on
the
head
he
supposed
the
man
dellogg
could
help
being
dead
but
he
mr
twist
equally
could
help
resenting
it
it
was
so
awkward
so
exceedingly
awkward
and
it
was
so
like
what
one
of
that
creature
uncle
arthur
friends
would
do
mr
twist
it
will
be
seen
was
frankly
unreasonable
but
then
he
was
very
much
taken
aback
and
annoyed
what
was
he
to
do
with
the
annas
he
was
obviously
not
a
relation
of
theirs
and
indeed
no
profiles
could
have
been
less
alike
and
he
did
suppose
acapulco
was
behind
other
parts
of
america
in
curiosity
and
gossip
if
he
stayed
on
at
the
cosmopolitan
with
the
twins
till
dellogg
was
approachable
again
whenever
that
might
be
every
sort
of
question
would
be
being
asked
in
whispers
about
who
they
were
and
what
was
their
relationship
and
presently
whenever
they
sat
down
anywhere
the
chairs
all
round
them
would
empty
mr
twist
had
seen
the
kind
of
thing
happening
in
hotels
before
to
other
people
never
to
himself
never
had
he
been
in
any
situation
till
now
that
was
not
luminously
regular
and
quite
soon
after
this
with
the
chairs
had
begun
to
happen
the
people
who
created
these
vacancies
were
told
by
the
manager
firmly
in
america
politely
in
england
and
sympathetically
in
france
that
their
rooms
had
been
engaged
a
long
time
ago
for
the
very
next
day
and
no
others
were
available
the
cosmopolitan
was
clearly
an
hotel
frequented
by
the
virtuous
rich
mr
twist
felt
that
he
and
the
annas
would
in
their
eyes
come
under
this
heading
not
that
is
when
the
other
guests
became
aware
of
the
entire
absence
of
any
relationship
between
him
and
the
twins
well
for
a
day
or
two
nothing
could
happen
for
a
day
or
two
before
his
party
had
had
time
to
sink
into
the
hotel
consciousness
and
the
manager
appeared
to
tell
him
the
rooms
were
engaged
he
could
think
things
out
and
talk
them
over
with
his
companions
perhaps
he
might
even
see
dellogg
the
funeral
he
had
heard
on
inquiring
of
the
hall
porter
was
next
day
it
was
to
be
a
brilliant
affair
said
the
porter
dellogg
had
been
a
prominent
inhabitant
free
with
his
money
a
supporter
of
anything
there
was
to
support
the
porter
talked
of
him
as
the
had
done
regretfully
and
respectfully
and
mr
twist
went
to
bed
angrier
than
ever
with
a
man
who
being
so
valuable
and
so
necessary
should
have
neglected
at
such
a
moment
to
go
on
living
mr
twist
did
sleep
very
well
that
night
he
lay
in
his
rosy
room
under
a
pink
silk
quilt
and
most
of
the
time
stared
out
through
the
open
french
windows
with
their
pink
brocade
curtains
at
the
great
starry
night
thinking
in
that
soft
bed
so
rosy
and
so
silken
as
to
have
been
worthy
of
the
relaxations
of
at
least
a
prima
donna
he
looked
like
some
lean
and
alien
bird
nesting
temporarily
where
he
had
no
business
to
he
thought
of
buying
silk
pyjamas
when
the
success
of
his
teapot
put
him
in
the
right
position
for
doing
so
because
his
soul
was
too
simple
for
him
to
desire
or
think
of
anything
less
candid
to
wear
in
bed
than
flannel
and
he
still
wore
the
blue
flannel
pyjamas
of
a
careful
bringing
up
in
that
beautiful
bed
his
pyjamas
did
seem
appropriate
also
his
head
so
frugal
of
hair
did
do
justice
to
the
lace
and
linen
of
a
pillow
prepared
for
the
hairier
head
of
again
at
least
a
prima
donna
and
finding
he
could
sleep
and
wishing
to
see
the
stars
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
then
looked
more
out
of
place
than
ever
but
as
nobody
was
there
to
see
him
which
mr
twist
sometimes
thought
when
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
his
pyjamas
at
is
one
of
the
comforts
of
being
virtuously
unmarried
nobody
minded
his
reflections
were
many
and
various
and
they
conflicted
with
and
contradicted
each
other
as
the
reflections
of
persons
in
a
difficult
position
who
have
mr
twist
sort
of
temperament
often
do
faced
by
a
dribbling
teapot
an
object
which
touched
none
of
the
softer
emotions
mr
twist
soared
undisturbed
in
the
calm
heights
of
a
detached
and
concentrated
intelligence
and
quickly
knew
what
to
do
with
it
faced
by
the
derelict
annas
his
heart
and
his
tenderness
got
in
the
ways
of
any
clear
vision
about
three
in
the
morning
when
his
mind
was
choked
and
strewn
with
much
and
finally
discarded
plans
he
suddenly
had
an
idea
a
real
one
as
far
as
he
could
see
a
real
good
one
he
would
place
the
annas
in
a
school
why
should
they
go
to
school
he
asked
himself
starting
off
answering
any
possible
objections
a
year
at
a
school
would
give
them
and
everybody
else
time
to
consider
they
ought
never
to
have
left
school
it
was
the
very
place
for
luxuriant
and
overflowing
natures
like
theirs
no
doubt
acapulco
had
such
a
thing
as
a
finishing
school
for
young
ladies
in
it
and
into
it
the
annas
should
go
and
once
in
it
there
they
should
stay
put
thought
mr
twist
in
vigorous
american
gathering
up
his
mouth
defiantly
down
these
lines
of
thought
his
relieved
mind
cantered
easily
he
would
seek
out
a
lawyer
the
next
morning
regularize
his
position
to
the
twins
by
turning
himself
into
their
guardian
and
then
get
them
at
once
into
the
best
school
there
was
as
their
guardian
he
could
then
pay
all
their
expenses
and
faced
by
this
legal
fact
they
would
he
hoped
be
soon
persuaded
of
the
propriety
of
his
paying
whatever
there
was
to
pay
mr
twist
was
so
much
pleased
by
his
idea
that
he
was
able
to
go
to
sleep
after
that
even
three
months
school
the
period
he
gave
dellogg
for
her
acutest
grief
would
do
tide
them
over
give
them
room
to
turn
round
in
it
was
a
great
solution
he
took
off
his
spectacles
snuggled
down
into
his
rosy
nest
and
fell
asleep
with
the
instantaneousness
of
one
whose
mind
is
suddenly
relieved
but
when
he
went
down
to
breakfast
he
did
feel
quite
so
sure
the
twins
did
look
somehow
as
though
they
would
want
to
go
to
school
they
had
been
busy
with
their
luggage
and
had
unpacked
one
of
the
trunks
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
aunt
alice
and
in
honour
of
the
heat
and
sunshine
and
the
heavenly
smell
of
heliotrope
that
was
in
the
warm
air
had
put
on
white
summer
frocks
impossible
to
imagine
anything
cooler
sweeter
prettier
and
more
angelically
good
than
those
two
annas
looked
as
they
came
out
on
to
the
great
verandah
of
the
hotel
to
join
mr
twist
at
breakfast
they
instantly
sank
into
the
hotel
consciousness
mr
twist
had
thought
this
would
happen
for
a
day
or
two
but
he
now
perceived
his
mistake
not
a
head
that
was
turned
to
look
at
them
not
a
newspaper
that
lowered
they
were
immediate
objects
of
interest
and
curiosity
entirely
benevolent
interest
and
curiosity
because
nobody
yet
knew
anything
about
them
and
the
wives
of
the
rich
husbands
those
halves
of
the
unions
which
provided
the
virtuousness
smiled
as
they
passed
and
murmured
nice
words
to
each
other
like
cute
and
cunning
mr
twist
being
a
good
american
stood
up
and
held
the
twins
chairs
for
them
when
they
appeared
they
loved
this
it
seemed
so
respectful
and
made
them
feel
so
old
and
to
he
had
done
it
that
night
in
new
york
at
supper
and
at
all
the
meals
in
the
train
in
spite
of
the
train
being
so
wobbly
and
each
time
they
had
loved
it
it
makes
one
have
such
they
agreed
commenting
on
this
agreeable
practice
in
private
they
sat
down
in
the
chairs
with
the
gracious
face
of
the
properly
treated
and
inquired
with
an
amiability
and
a
solicitous
politeness
on
a
par
with
their
treatment
how
mr
twist
had
slept
they
themselves
had
obviously
slept
well
for
their
faces
were
cherubic
in
their
bland
placidity
and
already
after
one
night
wore
what
mr
twist
later
came
to
recognize
as
the
californian
look
a
look
of
complete
unworriedness
yet
they
ought
to
have
been
worried
mr
twist
had
been
terribly
worried
up
to
the
moment
in
the
night
when
he
got
his
great
idea
and
he
was
worried
again
now
that
he
saw
the
twins
by
doubts
they
did
look
as
though
they
would
easily
be
put
to
school
his
idea
still
seemed
to
him
magnificent
a
great
solution
but
would
the
annas
be
able
to
see
it
they
might
turn
out
impervious
to
it
not
rejecting
it
but
simply
as
they
slowly
and
contentedly
ate
their
gazing
out
between
the
spoonfuls
at
the
sea
shining
across
the
road
through
palm
trees
and
looking
unruffled
itself
he
felt
it
was
going
to
be
rather
like
suggesting
to
two
cherubs
to
leave
their
serene
occupation
of
adoring
eternal
beauty
and
learn
lessons
instead
still
it
was
the
one
way
out
as
far
as
mr
twist
could
see
of
the
situation
produced
by
the
death
of
the
man
dellogg
when
you
done
breakfast
he
said
pulling
himself
together
on
their
reaching
the
waffle
stage
we
must
have
a
talk
when
we
done
breakfast
said
we
must
have
a
walk
down
there
said
pointing
with
her
spoon
on
the
sands
round
the
curve
to
where
the
pink
hills
begin
dellogg
death
said
mr
twist
deciding
it
was
necessary
at
once
to
wake
them
up
out
of
the
kind
of
happy
somnolescence
they
seemed
to
be
falling
into
has
of
course
completely
changed
how
unfortunate
interrupted
her
eyes
on
the
palms
and
the
sea
and
the
exquisite
distant
mountains
along
the
back
of
the
bay
to
have
to
be
dead
on
a
day
like
this
it
not
only
his
missing
the
fine
weather
that
makes
it
unfortunate
said
mr
twist
you
mean
said
it
our
missing
him
precisely
said
mr
twist
well
we
know
that
said
placidly
we
knew
it
last
night
and
it
worried
us
said
then
we
went
to
sleep
and
it
did
worry
us
and
this
morning
it
still
does
no
said
mr
twist
dryly
you
do
look
particularly
worried
i
must
say
no
said
we
not
people
who
find
they
got
to
heaven
are
usually
worried
are
they
and
having
got
to
heaven
said
we
thought
of
a
plan
to
enable
us
to
stay
in
it
oh
have
you
said
mr
twist
pricking
up
his
ears
the
plan
seemed
to
think
of
us
rather
than
we
of
it
explained
it
came
and
inserted
itself
as
it
were
into
our
minds
while
we
were
dressing
well
i
thought
of
a
plan
too
said
mr
twist
firmly
feeling
sure
that
the
twins
plan
would
be
the
sort
that
ought
to
be
instantly
nipped
in
the
bud
he
was
therefore
greatly
astonished
when
said
have
you
is
it
about
schools
he
stared
at
her
in
silence
yes
he
then
said
slowly
for
he
was
very
much
surprised
it
is
so
is
ours
said
indeed
said
mr
twist
yes
said
we
do
think
much
of
it
but
it
will
tide
us
over
exactly
said
mr
twist
still
more
astonished
at
this
perfect
harmony
of
ideas
tide
us
over
till
dellogg
is
began
in
her
clear
little
voice
that
carried
like
a
flute
to
all
the
tables
round
them
mr
twist
got
up
quickly
if
you
finished
let
us
go
out
of
doors
he
said
for
he
perceived
that
silence
had
fallen
on
the
other
tables
and
attentiveness
to
what
was
going
to
say
next
yes
on
the
sands
said
the
twins
getting
up
too
on
the
sands
however
mr
twist
soon
discovered
that
the
harmony
of
ideas
was
not
as
complete
as
he
had
supposed
indeed
something
very
like
heated
argument
began
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
on
some
rocks
round
the
corner
of
the
shore
to
the
west
of
the
hotel
and
they
became
aware
through
conversation
of
the
vital
difference
in
the
two
plans
the
twinkler
plan
which
they
expounded
at
much
length
and
with
a
profusion
of
optimistic
detail
was
to
search
for
and
find
a
school
in
the
neighbourhood
for
the
daughters
of
gentlemen
and
go
to
it
for
three
months
or
six
months
or
whatever
time
dellogg
wanted
to
recover
in
up
to
this
point
the
harmony
was
complete
and
mr
twist
could
only
nod
approval
beyond
it
all
was
confusion
for
it
appeared
that
the
twins
did
dream
of
entering
a
school
in
any
capacity
except
as
teachers
professors
they
said
professors
of
languages
and
literatures
they
could
speak
german
as
they
pointed
out
very
much
better
than
most
people
and
had
as
mr
twist
had
sometimes
himself
remarked
an
extensive
vocabulary
in
english
they
would
give
lessons
in
english
and
german
literature
they
would
be
able
to
teach
quite
a
lot
about
heine
for
instance
the
whole
of
whose
poetry
they
knew
by
heart
and
whose
sad
life
in
paris
it
no
good
running
on
like
that
interrupted
mr
twist
you
not
old
enough
not
old
enough
the
twinklers
from
their
separate
rocks
looked
at
each
other
in
surprised
indignation
not
old
enough
repeated
we
grown
up
and
i
do
see
how
one
can
be
more
than
grown
up
one
either
is
or
is
grown
up
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
which
we
are
and
this
the
very
man
who
so
respectfully
had
been
holding
their
chairs
for
them
only
a
few
minutes
before
as
if
people
did
things
like
that
for
children
you
not
old
enough
i
say
said
mr
twist
again
bringing
his
hand
down
with
a
slap
on
the
rock
to
emphasize
his
words
nobody
would
take
you
why
you
got
perambulator
faces
the
pair
of
you
perambulator
and
what
school
is
going
to
want
two
teachers
both
teaching
the
same
thing
anyway
and
he
then
quickly
got
out
his
plan
and
the
conversation
became
so
heated
that
for
a
time
it
was
molten
the
twinklers
were
shocked
by
his
plan
more
they
were
outraged
go
to
school
to
a
place
they
had
never
been
to
even
in
their
suitable
years
they
two
independent
with
in
the
bank
and
nobody
with
any
right
to
stop
their
doing
anything
they
wanted
to
go
to
school
now
like
a
couple
of
little
it
was
very
flushed
and
bright
of
eye
who
flung
this
expression
at
mr
twist
from
her
rock
he
might
think
they
had
perambulator
faces
if
he
liked
they
did
care
but
they
did
desire
him
to
bear
in
mind
that
if
it
had
been
for
the
war
they
would
be
now
taking
their
proper
place
in
society
that
they
had
already
done
a
course
of
nursing
in
a
hospital
an
activity
not
open
to
any
but
adults
and
that
uncle
arthur
had
certainly
not
given
them
all
that
money
to
fritter
away
on
paying
for
belated
schooling
we
would
be
anachronisms
said
winding
up
the
discussion
with
a
firmness
so
unusual
in
her
that
it
showed
how
completely
she
had
been
stirred
are
you
aware
that
we
are
marriageable
inquired
icily
and
do
you
think
it
bad
enough
for
us
to
be
aliens
and
undesirables
asked
without
getting
chronologically
confused
as
well
mr
twist
was
quiet
for
a
bit
he
could
compete
with
the
twinklers
when
it
came
to
sheer
language
he
sat
hunched
on
his
rock
his
face
supported
by
his
two
fists
staring
out
to
sea
while
the
twins
watched
him
indignantly
school
indeed
then
presently
he
pushed
his
hat
back
and
began
slowly
to
rub
his
ear
well
i
blest
if
i
know
what
to
do
with
you
then
he
said
continuing
to
rub
his
ear
and
stare
out
to
sea
the
twins
opened
their
mouths
simultaneously
at
this
to
protest
against
any
necessity
for
such
knowledge
on
his
part
but
he
interrupted
them
if
you
do
mind
he
said
i
like
to
resume
this
discussion
when
you
both
a
little
more
composed
we
perfectly
composed
said
less
ruffled
then
we
quite
unruffled
said
well
you
do
look
it
and
you
do
sound
like
it
but
as
this
is
important
i
be
glad
to
resume
the
discussion
say
i
suggest
we
spend
exploring
the
neighbourhood
and
steadying
our
minds
our
minds
are
perfectly
steady
thank
you
and
we
have
another
go
at
this
question
i
have
told
you
all
my
plan
yet
mr
twist
had
had
time
to
inform
them
of
his
wish
to
become
their
guardian
owing
to
the
swiftness
with
which
he
had
been
engulfed
in
their
indignation
but
whether
you
approve
of
it
or
not
what
is
quite
certain
is
that
we
ca
stay
on
at
the
hotel
much
longer
because
it
so
dear
oh
it
is
so
much
the
proprietor
is
a
friend
of
mine
or
anyhow
he
very
well
might
be
it
looks
very
dear
said
visions
of
their
splendid
bedroom
and
bathroom
rising
before
her
they
too
had
slept
in
silken
beds
and
the
taps
in
their
bathroom
they
had
judged
to
be
pure
gold
and
it
because
we
ca
afford
to
be
in
a
dear
place
spending
money
said
that
it
so
important
we
should
find
a
salaried
position
in
a
school
without
loss
of
time
and
it
because
we
ca
afford
reckless
squandering
that
we
ought
to
start
looking
for
such
a
situation
at
once
said
not
said
mr
twist
firmly
for
he
would
give
up
the
hope
of
getting
them
once
they
were
used
to
it
to
come
round
to
his
plan
this
one
day
we
give
ourselves
up
to
enjoyment
it
do
us
all
good
besides
we
do
often
get
to
a
place
like
this
do
we
and
it
has
taken
some
getting
to
has
it
he
rose
from
his
rock
and
offered
his
hand
to
help
them
off
theirs
enjoyment
he
said
business
i
crazy
he
added
artfully
to
see
what
the
country
is
like
away
up
in
those
hills
and
so
it
was
that
about
five
that
afternoon
having
spent
the
whole
day
exploring
the
charming
environs
of
acapulco
having
been
seen
at
different
periods
going
over
the
old
mission
in
tow
of
a
monk
who
would
look
at
them
but
kept
his
eyes
carefully
fixed
on
the
ground
sitting
on
high
stools
eating
strange
and
enchanting
ices
at
the
shop
in
the
town
that
has
the
best
ices
bathing
deliciously
in
the
warm
sea
at
the
foot
of
a
cliff
along
the
top
of
which
a
great
hedge
of
geraniums
flared
against
the
sky
lunching
under
a
grove
of
ilexes
on
the
contents
of
a
basket
produced
by
mr
twist
from
somewhere
in
the
car
he
had
hired
wandering
afterwards
up
through
eucalyptus
woods
across
the
fields
towards
the
foot
of
the
mountains
they
came
about
five
thirsty
and
thinking
of
tea
to
a
delightful
group
of
flowery
cottages
clustering
round
a
restaurant
and
forming
collectively
as
mr
twist
explained
one
of
the
many
american
forms
of
hotel
to
which
he
said
people
not
living
in
the
cottages
can
come
and
have
meals
at
the
restaurant
so
we
go
right
in
and
have
tea
and
it
was
just
because
they
could
get
tea
any
other
meal
the
proprietress
said
but
no
teas
were
served
owing
to
the
domestic
help
eight
hours
bill
which
obliged
her
to
do
without
domestics
during
the
afternoon
hours
that
came
by
her
great
idea
chapter
xxi
but
she
did
come
by
it
at
once
they
got
into
the
car
first
which
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
scented
road
at
the
bottom
of
the
field
they
had
walked
across
and
they
got
into
it
in
silence
and
were
driven
back
to
their
hotel
for
tea
and
her
brain
was
still
unvisited
by
inspiration
they
were
all
tired
and
thirsty
and
were
disappointed
at
being
thwarted
in
their
desire
to
sit
at
a
little
green
table
under
whispering
trees
and
rest
and
drink
tea
and
had
no
sort
of
wish
to
have
it
at
the
cosmopolitan
but
both
mr
twist
who
had
been
corrupted
by
europe
and
the
twins
who
had
the
habits
of
their
mother
could
imagine
doing
without
it
in
the
afternoon
and
they
would
have
it
in
the
hotel
sooner
than
not
have
it
at
all
it
was
brought
to
them
after
a
long
time
of
waiting
nobody
else
was
having
any
at
that
hour
and
the
waiter
when
at
last
one
was
found
had
difficulty
apparently
in
believing
that
they
were
serious
when
at
last
he
did
bring
it
it
was
toast
and
marmalade
and
for
all
the
world
as
though
it
had
been
breakfast
then
it
was
that
contemplating
this
with
discomfort
and
distaste
as
well
as
the
place
they
were
sitting
in
and
its
and
marble
and
rugs
was
suddenly
smitten
by
her
idea
it
fell
upon
her
like
a
blow
it
struck
her
fairly
as
it
were
between
the
eyes
she
was
used
to
ideas
and
she
stopped
dead
in
the
middle
of
a
piece
of
toast
and
looked
at
the
others
they
stopped
too
in
their
eating
and
looked
at
her
what
the
matter
asked
has
another
button
come
off
at
this
mr
twist
considered
it
wisest
to
turn
his
head
away
for
experience
had
taught
him
that
easily
came
undone
i
thought
of
something
said
mr
twist
turned
his
head
back
again
you
do
say
he
said
mildly
sarcastic
said
also
mildly
sarcastic
i
got
an
idea
said
but
it
so
luminous
she
said
looking
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
kind
of
surprise
of
course
that
what
we
do
ridiculous
to
waste
time
bothering
about
schools
there
was
a
new
expression
on
her
face
that
silenced
the
comments
rising
to
and
mr
twist
tongues
both
of
whom
had
tired
feet
and
were
therefore
disposed
to
sarcasm
looked
at
them
and
they
looked
at
her
and
her
face
continued
to
become
visibly
more
and
more
illuminated
just
as
if
a
curtain
were
being
pulled
up
animation
and
interest
shone
in
her
usually
dreamy
eyes
her
drooping
body
sat
up
quite
straight
she
reminded
who
had
a
biblically
mind
of
moses
when
he
came
down
from
receiving
the
law
on
the
mountain
well
tell
us
said
but
not
she
added
thinking
of
moses
if
it
only
more
commandments
dropped
the
piece
of
toast
she
was
still
holding
in
her
fingers
and
pushed
back
her
cup
come
out
on
to
the
rocks
she
said
getting
up
where
we
sat
this
morning
and
she
marched
out
followed
by
the
other
two
with
the
odd
submissiveness
people
show
towards
any
one
who
is
thoroughly
determined
it
was
dark
and
before
they
got
back
to
the
hotel
throughout
the
sunset
sat
on
her
rock
the
same
rock
she
had
sat
on
so
unsatisfactorily
eight
hours
earlier
and
expounded
her
idea
she
could
talk
fast
enough
she
so
slow
and
listless
for
once
was
shaken
into
burning
activity
she
threw
off
her
hat
directly
she
got
on
to
the
sands
climbed
up
the
rock
as
if
it
were
a
pulpit
and
with
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knees
poured
out
her
plan
the
long
shafts
of
the
setting
sun
bathing
her
in
bright
flames
and
making
her
more
like
moses
than
ever
if
that
is
one
could
imagine
moses
as
beautiful
as
thought
and
as
felicitously
without
his
nose
and
beard
it
was
wonderful
how
complete
inspiration
was
it
reminded
mr
twist
of
his
own
about
the
teapot
it
was
of
course
a
far
more
complicated
matter
than
that
little
device
of
his
and
would
have
to
be
thought
out
very
carefully
and
approached
very
judiciously
but
the
wealth
of
detail
she
was
already
ready
with
immensely
impressed
him
she
even
had
a
name
for
the
thing
and
it
was
when
he
heard
this
name
when
it
flashed
into
her
talk
with
the
unpremeditatedness
of
an
inspiration
that
mr
twist
became
definitely
enthusiastic
he
had
an
american
eye
for
advertisement
respect
for
it
was
in
his
blood
he
instantly
saw
the
possibilities
contained
in
the
name
he
saw
what
could
be
done
with
it
properly
worked
he
saw
it
on
signposts
in
a
thousand
contrivances
for
catching
the
public
attention
and
sticking
there
the
idea
of
course
was
fantastic
unconventional
definitely
outside
what
his
mother
and
that
man
uncle
arthur
would
consider
proper
but
it
was
outside
the
standards
of
such
people
that
life
and
fruitfulness
and
interest
and
joy
began
he
had
escaped
from
the
grip
of
his
mother
and
uncle
arthur
had
himself
forcibly
expulsed
the
annas
from
his
and
now
that
they
were
all
so
far
away
instead
of
still
timorously
trying
to
go
on
living
up
to
those
distant
sterile
ideas
why
they
boldly
go
out
into
the
light
and
colour
that
was
waiting
everywhere
for
the
free
of
spirit
mr
twist
had
often
observed
how
perplexingly
much
there
is
to
be
said
for
the
opposite
sides
of
a
question
he
was
now
but
with
no
perplexity
for
had
roused
his
enthusiasm
himself
taking
the
very
opposite
view
as
to
the
proper
thing
for
the
twins
to
do
from
the
one
he
had
taken
in
the
night
and
on
the
rocks
that
morning
school
nonsense
absurd
to
bury
these
bright
shoots
of
everlastingness
this
is
what
they
looked
like
to
him
afire
with
enthusiasm
and
the
setting
sun
in
such
a
place
of
ink
if
the
plan
owing
to
the
extreme
youth
of
the
annas
were
unconventional
conventionality
could
be
secured
by
giving
a
big
enough
salary
to
a
lady
to
come
and
preside
he
himself
would
hover
beneficently
in
the
background
over
the
undertaking
idea
was
to
use
uncle
arthur
in
renting
one
of
the
little
wooden
cottages
that
seemed
to
be
plentiful
preferably
one
about
five
miles
out
in
the
country
make
it
look
inside
like
an
english
cottage
all
pewter
and
chintz
and
valances
make
it
look
outside
like
the
more
innocent
type
of
german
wayside
inn
with
green
tables
and
spreading
trees
get
a
cook
who
would
concentrate
on
cakes
real
lovely
ones
various
poetic
wonderful
cakes
and
start
an
inn
for
tea
alone
that
should
become
the
fashion
it
ought
to
be
so
arranged
that
it
became
the
fashion
she
and
would
do
the
waiting
the
prices
would
be
very
high
indeed
exorbitant
this
mr
twist
regarded
as
another
inspiration
so
that
it
should
be
a
distinction
give
people
a
to
have
had
tea
at
their
cottage
and
in
a
prominent
position
in
the
road
in
front
of
it
where
every
would
be
bound
to
see
it
there
would
be
a
real
wayside
inn
signboard
such
as
inns
in
england
always
have
with
its
name
on
it
if
people
here
were
really
neutral
you
might
have
the
imperial
arms
of
germany
and
england
emblazoned
on
it
interrupted
mr
twist
just
to
show
your
own
extreme
and
peculiar
neutrality
we
might
call
it
the
christopher
and
columbus
interrupted
who
had
been
sitting
hanging
on
words
or
you
might
call
it
the
cup
and
saucer
said
mr
twist
and
have
a
big
cup
brimming
with
tea
and
cream
painted
on
it
no
said
it
is
the
open
arms
that
is
its
name
and
mr
twist
inclined
to
smile
and
criticise
up
to
this
bowed
his
head
in
instantaneous
recognition
and
acceptance
he
became
definitely
enthusiastic
of
course
he
would
see
to
it
that
not
a
shadow
of
ambiguousness
was
allowed
to
rest
on
such
a
name
the
whole
thing
as
he
saw
it
his
mind
working
rapidly
while
still
talked
would
be
a
happy
joke
a
joyous
gay
little
assault
on
the
purses
of
millionaires
in
whom
the
district
abounded
judging
from
the
beautiful
houses
and
gardens
he
had
passed
that
day
but
a
joke
and
a
gay
assault
that
would
at
the
same
time
employ
and
support
the
annas
solve
them
in
fact
saw
mr
twist
who
all
day
long
had
been
regarding
them
much
as
one
does
a
difficult
mathematical
problem
it
was
mr
twist
who
added
the
final
inspiration
to
many
when
at
last
she
paused
for
want
of
breath
the
inn
he
said
should
be
run
as
a
war
philanthropy
all
that
was
over
after
the
expenses
were
paid
and
a
proper
percentage
reserved
by
the
annas
as
interest
on
their
invested
capital
they
listened
with
eager
respect
to
these
expressions
would
be
handed
over
to
the
american
red
cross
that
explained
mr
twist
would
seal
the
inn
as
both
respectable
and
fashionable
which
is
exactly
what
we
would
want
to
make
it
and
he
then
announced
and
they
accepted
without
argument
or
questioning
in
the
general
excitement
that
he
would
have
himself
appointed
their
legal
guardian
they
did
go
back
to
the
cosmopolitan
till
dinnertime
there
was
so
much
to
say
and
after
dinner
a
meal
at
which
mr
twist
had
to
suppress
them
a
good
deal
because
the
open
arms
kept
on
bursting
through
into
their
talk
and
as
at
breakfast
the
people
at
the
tables
round
them
were
obviously
trying
to
hear
they
went
out
once
again
on
to
the
and
walked
up
and
down
till
late
continuing
the
discussion
mostly
simultaneously
as
regards
the
twins
while
mr
twist
chimed
in
with
practical
suggestions
whenever
they
stopped
to
take
breath
he
had
to
drive
them
indoors
to
bed
at
last
for
the
lights
were
going
out
one
by
one
in
the
cosmopolitan
bedroom
windows
where
the
virtuous
rich
exhausted
by
their
day
of
virtue
were
subsiding
prostrate
with
boredom
and
respectability
into
their
various
legitimate
lairs
and
he
stayed
alone
out
by
the
sea
rapidly
sketching
out
his
activities
for
the
next
day
there
was
the
guardianship
to
be
arranged
the
cottage
to
be
found
and
the
lady
to
be
advertised
for
she
indeed
must
be
secured
at
once
got
to
come
at
once
to
the
cosmopolitan
and
preside
over
the
twins
until
they
all
proceeded
in
due
season
to
the
open
arms
she
must
be
a
motherly
lady
decided
mr
twist
affectionate
skilled
in
managing
a
cook
intellectual
and
obedient
her
feminine
tact
would
enable
her
to
appear
to
preside
while
she
was
in
reality
obeying
she
must
understand
that
she
was
there
for
the
annas
and
that
the
annas
were
not
there
for
her
she
must
approach
the
situation
in
the
spirit
of
the
enlightened
king
of
a
democratic
country
who
receives
its
honours
accepts
its
respect
but
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
is
merely
the
chief
servant
of
the
people
mr
twist
did
want
a
female
uncle
arthur
let
loose
upon
those
blessed
little
girls
besides
they
would
have
the
dangerous
weapon
in
their
hands
of
being
able
to
give
her
notice
and
it
would
considerably
dim
the
reputation
of
the
open
arms
if
there
were
a
too
frequent
departure
from
it
of
ladies
mr
twist
felt
himself
very
responsible
and
full
of
anxieties
as
he
paced
up
and
down
alone
but
he
was
really
enjoying
himself
that
youthful
side
of
him
so
usual
in
the
artistic
temperament
which
leaped
about
at
the
least
pleasant
provocation
like
a
happy
lamb
when
the
sunshine
tickles
it
was
feeling
that
this
was
great
fun
and
the
business
side
of
him
was
feeling
that
it
was
not
only
great
fun
but
probably
an
extraordinarily
productive
piece
of
the
ignorant
annas
bless
their
little
hearts
he
thought
he
who
only
the
night
before
on
that
very
spot
had
been
calling
them
accursed
believed
that
their
was
easily
going
to
do
everything
this
was
lucky
for
otherwise
there
would
have
been
some
thorny
paths
of
argument
and
convincing
to
be
got
through
before
they
would
have
allowed
him
to
help
finance
the
undertaking
probably
they
never
would
have
in
their
scrupulous
independence
mr
twist
reflected
with
satisfaction
on
the
usefulness
of
his
teapot
at
last
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
do
something
thanks
to
it
that
gave
him
real
gladness
his
ambulance
to
france
that
was
duty
his
lavishness
to
his
mother
that
again
was
duty
but
here
was
delight
here
at
last
was
what
his
lonely
heart
had
always
longed
for
a
chance
to
help
and
make
happy
and
be
with
and
watch
being
made
happy
dear
dear
soft
sweet
kind
dear
dear
it
has
been
said
somewhere
before
that
mr
twist
was
meant
by
nature
to
be
a
mother
but
nature
when
she
was
through
him
forgot
and
turned
him
into
a
man
chapter
xxii
the
very
next
morning
they
set
out
and
two
days
later
they
had
found
what
they
wanted
not
exactly
what
they
wanted
of
course
for
the
reason
as
explained
that
nothing
ever
is
but
full
of
possibilities
to
the
eye
of
imagination
and
there
were
six
of
this
sort
of
eye
gazing
at
the
little
house
it
stood
at
right
angles
to
a
road
much
used
by
motorists
because
of
its
beauty
and
hidden
from
it
by
trees
on
the
top
of
a
slope
of
green
fields
scattered
over
with
live
oaks
that
gently
descended
down
towards
the
sea
its
back
windows
and
those
parts
of
it
that
a
house
is
ashamed
of
were
close
up
to
a
thick
grove
of
eucalyptus
which
continued
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
it
had
an
overrun
little
garden
in
front
separated
from
the
fields
by
a
riotous
hedge
of
sweetbriar
it
had
a
few
orange
and
lemon
and
peach
trees
on
its
west
side
the
survivors
of
what
had
once
been
intended
for
an
orchard
and
a
line
of
pepper
trees
on
the
other
between
it
and
the
road
neglected
roses
and
a
huge
wistaria
clambered
over
its
dilapidated
face
somebody
had
once
planted
syringas
and
snowballs
and
lilacs
along
the
inside
of
the
line
of
pepper
trees
and
they
had
grown
extravagantly
and
were
an
impenetrable
screen
even
without
the
sweeping
pepper
trees
from
the
road
it
had
been
lived
in
for
years
and
it
was
well
on
in
decay
being
made
of
wood
but
the
situation
was
perfect
for
the
open
arms
every
motorist
coming
up
that
road
would
see
the
signboard
outside
the
pepper
trees
and
would
certainly
want
to
stop
at
the
neat
little
gate
and
pass
through
the
flowery
tunnel
that
would
be
cut
through
the
syringas
and
see
what
was
inside
other
houses
were
offered
of
a
far
higher
class
for
this
one
had
never
been
lived
in
by
gentry
said
the
endeavouring
to
put
them
off
a
thing
so
broken
down
a
farmer
had
had
it
years
back
he
told
them
and
instead
of
confining
himself
to
drinking
the
milk
from
his
own
cows
which
was
the
only
appropriate
drink
for
a
farmer
the
agent
maintained
he
was
the
president
of
the
local
league
he
put
his
money
as
he
earned
it
into
gin
and
the
gin
into
himself
and
so
after
a
bit
was
done
for
the
other
houses
the
agent
pressed
on
them
were
superior
in
every
way
except
situation
but
situation
being
the
first
consideration
mr
twist
agreed
with
the
twins
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
neglected
little
house
whose
shabbiness
was
being
so
industriously
hidden
by
roses
that
this
was
the
place
and
a
week
later
it
and
its
garden
had
been
bought
mr
twist
did
tell
the
twins
he
had
bought
it
in
order
to
avoid
argument
but
it
was
manifestly
the
simple
thing
to
do
and
over
and
round
and
through
it
swarmed
workmen
all
day
long
like
so
many
diligent
and
determined
ants
also
before
the
week
was
out
the
lady
had
been
found
and
engaged
and
a
cook
of
gifts
in
the
matter
of
cakes
this
is
the
way
you
do
things
in
america
you
decide
what
it
is
that
you
really
want
and
you
start
right
away
and
get
it
and
everything
so
cheap
too
exclaimed
the
twins
gleefully
whose
was
behaving
it
appeared
very
like
the
widow
cruse
this
belief
however
received
a
blow
when
they
went
without
mr
twist
who
was
too
busy
now
for
any
extra
expeditions
to
choose
and
buy
chintzes
and
it
was
finally
shattered
when
the
various
ladies
who
responded
to
mr
twist
cry
for
help
in
the
advertising
columns
of
the
acapulco
and
los
angeles
press
one
and
all
demanded
as
salary
more
than
the
whole
twinkler
capital
the
twins
had
a
bad
moment
of
chill
fear
and
misgiving
and
then
once
more
were
saved
by
an
inspiration
this
time
i
know
she
exclaimed
her
face
clearing
we
make
it
mr
twist
whose
brow
too
had
been
puckered
in
the
effort
to
think
out
a
way
of
persuading
the
twins
to
let
him
help
them
openly
with
his
money
for
in
spite
of
his
going
to
be
their
guardian
they
remained
difficult
on
this
point
jumped
at
the
idea
he
could
of
course
tell
what
in
mind
the
word
stood
for
but
felt
confident
that
whatever
it
stood
for
he
could
manipulate
it
into
covering
his
difficulties
what
is
asked
with
a
new
respect
for
a
sister
who
could
suddenly
produce
a
business
word
like
that
and
seem
to
know
all
about
it
she
had
heard
the
word
herself
but
it
sat
very
loosely
in
her
head
at
no
point
touching
anything
else
have
you
heard
of
stores
inquired
yes
but
well
then
yes
but
what
would
a
inn
be
persisted
one
run
on
lines
of
course
said
grandly
everybody
pays
for
everything
so
that
nobody
particular
pays
for
anything
oh
said
i
mean
said
who
felt
herself
that
this
might
be
clearer
it
when
you
pay
the
servants
and
the
rent
and
the
cakes
and
things
out
of
what
you
get
oh
said
and
will
they
wait
quite
quietly
till
got
it
of
course
if
we
all
i
see
said
who
saw
as
little
as
before
but
knew
of
old
that
grew
irascible
when
pressed
see
here
now
said
mr
twist
weightily
if
that
is
an
idea
only
you
got
hold
of
the
wrong
word
the
word
you
want
is
and
as
this
undertaking
is
going
to
be
a
big
success
there
will
be
big
profits
and
any
amount
of
cakes
and
salaries
will
be
paid
for
as
glibly
and
easily
as
you
can
say
your
abc
and
he
explained
that
till
they
were
fairly
started
he
was
going
to
stay
in
california
and
that
he
intended
during
this
time
to
be
secretary
and
treasurer
to
the
open
arms
besides
which
was
he
said
the
most
important
post
of
all
and
if
they
would
be
so
good
as
to
leave
this
side
of
it
unquestioningly
to
him
who
had
had
a
business
training
he
would
undertake
that
the
red
cross
american
or
british
whichever
they
decided
to
support
should
profit
handsomely
thus
did
mr
twist
artfully
obtain
a
free
hand
as
financial
backer
of
the
open
arms
the
system
seemed
to
the
twins
admirable
it
cleared
away
every
scruple
and
every
difficulty
they
now
bought
chintzes
and
pewter
pots
in
the
faith
of
it
without
a
qualm
and
even
ceased
to
blench
at
the
salary
of
the
lady
engaged
to
be
their
background
indeed
her
very
expensiveness
pleased
them
for
it
gave
them
confidence
that
she
must
at
such
a
price
be
the
right
one
because
nobody
they
agreed
who
knew
herself
not
to
be
the
right
one
would
have
the
face
to
demand
so
much
this
lady
the
widow
of
bruce
bilton
of
chicago
of
whom
of
course
she
said
the
miss
twinklers
had
heard
the
miss
twinklers
blushed
and
felt
ashamed
of
themselves
because
they
had
and
indistinctly
murmured
something
about
having
heard
of
cornelius
vanderbilt
though
and
would
he
do
had
a
great
deal
of
very
beautiful
hair
while
at
the
same
time
she
was
only
she
firmly
announced
when
she
perceived
mr
twist
spectacles
dwelling
on
her
hair
that
she
was
yet
forty
and
her
one
fear
was
that
she
might
be
enough
the
advertisement
had
particularly
mentioned
and
though
she
was
aware
that
her
brains
and
fingers
and
feet
could
possibly
be
described
as
coming
under
that
heading
she
said
her
hair
on
the
other
hand
might
well
be
regarded
as
having
overshot
the
mark
but
its
turning
white
had
nothing
to
do
with
age
it
had
done
that
when
bilton
passed
over
no
hair
could
have
stood
such
grief
as
hers
when
bilton
took
that
final
step
she
had
been
considering
the
question
of
age
she
informed
mr
twist
from
every
aspect
before
coming
to
the
interview
for
she
did
want
to
make
a
mistake
herself
nor
allow
the
miss
twinklers
to
make
a
mistake
and
she
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
what
with
her
hair
being
too
old
and
the
rest
of
her
being
too
young
taken
altogether
she
struck
an
absolute
average
and
perfectly
fulfilled
the
condition
required
and
as
she
wished
to
live
in
the
country
town
life
disturbing
her
psychically
too
much
she
was
willing
to
give
up
her
home
and
her
circle
it
was
a
real
sacrifice
and
accept
the
position
offered
by
the
miss
twinklers
she
was
she
said
very
quiet
and
yet
at
the
same
time
she
was
very
active
she
liked
to
fly
round
among
duties
and
she
liked
to
retire
into
her
own
mentality
and
think
she
was
all
for
equilibrium
for
the
right
balancing
of
body
and
mind
in
a
proper
alternation
of
suitable
action
thus
she
attained
poise
she
was
one
of
the
most
poised
women
her
friends
knew
they
told
her
also
she
had
a
warm
heart
and
liked
both
philanthropy
and
orphans
especially
if
they
were
war
ones
bilton
talked
so
quickly
and
so
profusely
that
it
took
quite
a
long
time
to
engage
her
there
never
seemed
to
be
a
pause
in
which
one
could
do
it
it
was
in
los
angeles
in
an
hotel
to
which
mr
twist
had
motored
the
twins
starting
at
daybreak
that
morning
in
order
to
see
this
lady
that
the
personal
interview
took
place
and
by
they
had
been
personally
interviewing
her
for
three
hours
without
stopping
it
seemed
years
the
twins
longed
to
engage
her
if
only
to
keep
her
quiet
but
bilton
spirited
description
of
life
as
she
saw
it
and
of
the
way
it
affected
something
she
called
her
psyche
was
without
punctuation
and
without
even
the
tiny
gap
of
a
comma
in
it
through
which
one
might
have
dexterously
slipped
a
definite
offer
she
had
to
be
interrupted
at
last
in
spite
of
the
discomfort
this
gave
to
the
twinkler
and
twist
politeness
because
a
cook
was
coming
to
be
interviewed
directly
after
lunch
and
they
were
dying
for
some
food
the
moment
mr
twist
saw
bilton
beautiful
white
hair
he
knew
she
was
the
one
that
hair
was
what
the
open
arms
wanted
and
must
have
that
hair
with
a
black
dress
to
go
with
it
would
be
a
shield
through
which
no
breath
of
misunderstanding
as
to
the
singleness
of
purpose
with
which
the
inn
was
run
would
ever
penetrate
he
would
have
settled
it
with
her
in
five
minutes
if
she
could
have
been
got
to
listen
but
bilton
could
be
got
to
listen
and
when
it
became
clear
that
no
amount
of
patient
waiting
would
bring
him
any
nearer
the
end
of
what
she
had
to
say
mr
twist
was
forced
to
take
off
his
coat
as
it
were
and
plunge
abruptly
into
the
very
middle
of
her
flow
of
words
and
convey
to
her
as
quickly
as
possible
as
one
swimming
for
his
life
against
the
stream
that
she
was
engaged
engaged
bilton
he
called
out
raising
his
voice
above
the
sound
of
bilton
rushing
words
engaged
she
would
be
expected
at
the
cosmopolitan
swiftly
continued
mr
twist
who
was
as
particularly
anxious
to
have
her
at
the
cosmopolitan
as
the
twins
were
particularly
anxious
not
to
for
for
the
life
of
them
they
could
see
why
bilton
should
be
stirred
up
before
they
started
inhabiting
the
cottage
within
three
days
mr
twist
it
ca
be
done
broke
in
bilton
a
fresh
and
mountainous
wave
of
speech
gathering
above
mr
twist
head
it
absolutely
within
a
week
then
he
called
out
quickly
holding
up
the
breaking
of
the
wave
for
an
instant
while
he
hastened
to
and
opened
the
door
and
goodmorning
bilton
my
apologies
my
sincere
apologies
but
we
have
to
hurry
away
the
cook
was
engaged
that
afternoon
mr
twist
appeared
to
have
mixed
up
the
answers
to
his
advertisement
for
when
after
paying
the
he
went
to
join
the
twins
in
the
he
found
them
waiting
for
him
in
the
passage
outside
the
door
looking
excited
the
cook
come
whispered
jerking
her
head
towards
the
shut
door
she
a
man
she
a
chinaman
whispered
mr
twist
was
surprised
he
thought
he
had
an
appointment
with
a
woman
a
coloured
lady
from
south
carolina
who
was
a
specialist
in
pastries
and
had
immaculate
references
but
the
chinaman
assured
him
that
he
had
and
that
his
appointment
was
with
him
alone
with
him
li
koo
in
proof
of
it
he
said
spreading
out
his
hands
here
he
was
we
make
cakies
cakies
many
lovely
cakies
said
li
koo
observing
doubt
on
the
gentleman
face
and
from
somewhere
on
his
person
he
whipped
out
a
paper
bag
of
them
as
a
conjurer
whips
a
rabbit
out
of
a
hat
and
offered
them
to
the
twins
they
ate
he
was
engaged
it
took
five
minutes
after
he
had
gone
and
punctually
to
the
minute
of
her
appointment
an
negress
appeared
and
announced
that
she
was
the
coloured
lady
from
south
carolina
to
whom
the
gentleman
had
written
mr
twist
uncomfortably
felt
that
li
koo
had
somehow
been
clever
impossible
however
to
go
back
on
him
having
eaten
his
cakes
besides
they
were
perfect
cakes
blown
together
apparently
out
of
flowers
and
honey
and
cream
cakes
which
combined
with
bilton
hair
would
make
the
fortune
of
the
open
arms
the
coloured
lady
therefore
was
sent
away
disappointed
in
spite
of
the
and
fair
words
mr
twist
gave
her
and
she
was
so
much
disappointed
that
they
could
hear
her
being
it
out
loud
all
the
way
along
the
passage
and
down
the
stairs
and
the
nature
of
her
expression
of
her
disappointment
was
such
that
mr
twist
as
he
tried
by
animated
conversation
to
prevent
it
reaching
the
twins
ears
could
only
be
thankful
after
all
that
li
koo
had
been
so
clever
it
did
however
reach
the
twins
ears
but
they
did
turn
a
hair
because
of
uncle
arthur
they
merely
expressed
surprise
at
its
redness
seeing
that
it
came
out
of
somebody
so
black
directly
after
this
trip
to
los
angeles
advertisements
began
to
creep
over
the
countryside
they
crept
along
the
roads
where
motorists
were
frequent
and
peeped
at
passing
cars
round
corners
and
over
hedges
they
were
taciturn
advertisements
and
just
said
three
words
in
big
straight
plain
white
letters
on
a
ground
the
open
arms
people
passing
in
their
cars
saw
them
and
vaguely
thought
it
must
be
the
name
of
a
book
they
had
better
get
it
other
people
would
have
got
it
it
could
be
a
medicine
nor
anything
to
eat
and
was
probably
a
religious
novel
novels
about
feet
or
arms
were
usually
religious
a
few
considered
it
sounded
a
little
improper
and
as
though
the
book
far
from
being
religious
would
not
be
altogether
nice
but
only
very
proper
people
who
distrusted
everything
even
arms
took
this
view
after
a
week
the
same
advertisements
appeared
with
three
lines
added
the
open
arms
yes
but
why
where
what
and
then
ten
days
after
that
came
fresh
ones
the
open
arms
will
open
wide
on
november
at
four
watch
the
signposts
and
while
the
countryside
an
idle
countryside
engaged
almost
wholly
in
and
glad
of
any
new
distraction
began
to
be
interested
and
asked
questions
mr
twist
was
working
day
and
night
at
getting
the
thing
ready
all
day
long
he
was
in
acapulco
or
out
at
the
cottage
urging
hurrying
criticizing
encouraging
praising
and
admonishing
his
heart
and
soul
and
brain
was
in
this
his
business
instincts
and
his
soft
domestic
side
his
brain
after
working
at
top
speed
during
the
day
with
the
architect
the
painter
and
decorator
the
furnisher
the
garden
expert
the
plumbing
expert
the
expert
the
lawyer
the
estate
agent
and
numberless
other
persons
during
the
night
meditated
and
evolved
advertisements
there
was
to
be
a
continual
stream
week
by
week
after
the
inn
was
opened
of
ingenious
advertisements
altogether
mr
twist
had
his
hands
full
the
inn
was
to
look
artless
and
simple
and
small
while
actually
being
the
last
word
in
roomy
and
sophisticated
comfort
it
was
to
be
as
like
an
old
english
inn
to
look
at
as
it
could
possibly
be
got
to
be
going
on
his
own
and
the
twins
recollections
and
the
sensationally
coloured
elizabethan
pictures
in
the
architect
portfolio
it
did
disturb
mr
twist
unprejudiced
american
mind
that
an
english
inn
embowered
in
heliotrope
and
arum
lilies
and
eucalyptus
trees
would
be
odd
and
unnatural
and
it
would
disturb
anybody
else
there
either
were
not
swiss
mountain
chalets
to
be
found
in
the
fertile
plains
along
the
pacific
complete
with
fir
trees
specially
imported
and
uprooted
in
their
maturity
and
brought
down
with
tons
of
their
own
earth
attached
to
their
roots
and
replanted
among
carefully
disposed
apparently
swiss
rocks
so
that
what
one
day
had
been
a
place
smiling
with
was
the
next
a
bit
of
frowning
northern
landscape
and
were
there
not
italian
villas
dotted
about
also
but
these
looked
happier
and
more
at
home
than
the
chalets
and
there
were
buildings
too
like
small
gothic
cathedrals
looking
as
uncomfortable
and
depressed
as
a
woman
who
has
come
to
a
party
in
the
wrong
clothes
but
no
matter
nobody
minded
so
that
an
english
inn
added
to
this
company
with
a
little
german
only
there
was
to
be
any
beer
would
cause
the
least
surprise
or
discomfort
to
anybody
in
the
end
the
sole
resemblance
the
cottage
had
to
an
english
inn
was
the
signboard
out
in
the
road
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
and
the
liveliest
financial
encouragement
from
mr
twist
the
architect
in
three
weeks
turn
a
wooden
californian
cottage
into
an
ancient
elizabethan
pothouse
he
got
a
thatched
roof
on
to
it
by
a
miracle
of
hustle
but
the
wooden
walls
remained
he
also
found
a
real
antique
heavy
oak
front
door
studded
with
big
rusty
nailheads
in
a
san
francisco
curiosity
shop
that
would
serve
he
said
as
a
basis
for
any
later
on
when
there
was
more
time
to
the
old
epoch
thus
did
he
refer
to
great
eliza
and
her
spacious
days
and
meanwhile
it
gave
the
building
he
alleged
a
considerable
air
but
as
this
door
in
that
fine
climate
was
hooked
open
all
day
long
it
disturb
the
gay
the
almost
jocose
appearance
of
the
place
when
everything
was
finished
houses
have
their
expressions
their
distinctive
faces
very
much
as
people
have
meditated
mr
twist
the
morning
of
the
opening
as
he
sat
astride
a
green
chair
at
the
bottom
of
the
little
garden
where
a
hedge
of
sweetbriar
beautifully
separated
the
twinkler
domain
from
the
rolling
fields
that
lay
between
it
and
the
pacific
and
stared
at
his
handiwork
and
the
conclusion
was
forced
upon
him
reluctantly
for
it
was
the
last
thing
he
had
wanted
the
open
arms
to
do
that
the
thing
looked
as
if
it
were
winking
at
him
positively
thought
mr
twist
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
staring
that
was
what
it
seemed
to
be
doing
how
was
that
he
studied
it
profoundly
his
head
on
one
side
was
it
that
it
was
so
very
gay
he
had
meant
it
to
be
gay
like
that
he
had
intended
a
restrained
and
disciplined
simplicity
a
puritan
unpretentiousness
with
those
sweet
maidens
the
twinkler
twins
flitting
like
modest
doves
in
and
out
among
its
but
one
small
thing
had
been
added
to
another
small
thing
at
their
suggestion
each
small
thing
taken
separately
apparently
not
mattering
at
all
and
here
it
was
almost
he
hoped
it
was
only
his
imagination
winking
at
him
it
looked
a
familiar
little
house
jocular
very
open
indeed
about
the
arms
chapter
xxiii
various
things
had
happened
however
before
this
morning
of
the
great
day
was
reached
and
mr
twist
had
had
some
harassing
experiences
one
of
the
first
things
he
had
done
after
the
visit
to
los
angeles
was
to
take
steps
in
the
matter
of
the
guardianship
he
had
written
to
bilton
that
he
was
the
miss
twinklers
guardian
though
it
was
not
at
that
moment
true
it
was
clear
he
thought
that
it
should
be
made
true
as
quickly
as
possible
and
he
therefore
sought
out
a
lawyer
in
acapulco
the
morning
after
the
interview
this
was
not
the
same
lawyer
who
did
his
estate
business
for
him
mr
twist
thought
it
best
to
have
a
separate
one
for
more
personal
affairs
on
hearing
mr
twist
name
announced
the
lawyer
greeted
him
as
an
old
friend
he
knew
of
course
all
about
the
teapot
for
the
was
as
frequent
in
american
families
as
the
bible
and
much
more
regularly
used
but
he
also
knew
about
the
cottage
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
what
it
had
cost
which
was
little
and
what
it
would
cost
which
was
enormous
before
it
was
fit
to
live
in
the
only
thing
he
know
was
that
it
was
to
be
used
for
anything
except
an
ordinary
he
had
heard
too
of
the
presence
at
the
cosmopolitan
of
the
twins
and
on
this
point
like
the
rest
of
acapulco
was
a
little
curious
the
social
column
of
the
acapulco
daily
paper
had
been
able
to
give
any
accurate
description
of
the
relationship
of
the
twinklers
to
mr
twist
its
paragraph
announcing
his
arrival
had
been
obliged
merely
to
say
while
awaiting
more
detailed
information
that
edward
a
twist
the
breakfast
table
benefactor
and
gifted
inventor
of
the
famous
teapot
had
arrived
from
new
york
and
was
staying
at
the
cosmopolitan
hotel
with
and
the
day
after
this
the
lawyer
who
got
about
a
bit
as
everybody
else
did
in
that
encouraging
climate
happening
to
look
in
at
the
cosmopolitan
to
have
a
talk
with
a
friend
had
seen
the
it
was
in
the
act
of
passing
through
the
hall
on
its
way
upstairs
followed
by
a
boy
carrying
a
canary
in
a
cage
even
without
the
boy
and
the
canary
it
was
a
conspicuous
object
the
lawyer
asked
his
friend
who
the
cute
little
girls
were
and
was
interested
to
hear
he
was
beholding
edward
a
twist
his
friend
told
him
that
opinion
in
the
hotel
was
divided
about
the
precise
nature
of
this
and
its
relationship
to
mr
twist
but
it
finally
came
to
be
generally
supposed
that
the
miss
twinklers
had
been
placed
in
his
charge
by
parents
living
far
away
in
order
that
he
might
safely
see
them
put
to
one
of
the
young
ladies
finishing
schools
in
that
agreeable
district
the
house
mr
twist
was
taking
was
not
connected
in
the
cosmopolitan
mind
with
the
twinklers
houses
were
always
being
taken
in
that
paradise
by
wealthy
persons
from
unkinder
climates
he
would
live
in
it
three
months
in
the
year
thought
the
cosmopolitan
bring
his
mother
and
keep
in
this
way
an
occasional
eye
on
his
charges
the
hotel
guests
regarded
the
twinklers
at
this
stage
with
nothing
but
benevolence
and
goodwill
for
they
had
up
to
then
only
been
seen
and
not
heard
and
as
one
of
their
leading
characteristics
was
a
desire
to
explain
especially
if
anybody
looked
a
little
surprised
which
everybody
usually
did
quite
early
in
conversation
with
them
this
was
at
that
moment
the
delicate
moment
before
bilton
arrival
fortunate
the
lawyer
then
who
appreciated
the
young
and
pretty
as
much
as
other
honest
men
began
the
interview
with
mr
twist
by
warmly
congratulating
him
when
he
heard
what
he
had
come
for
on
his
taste
in
wards
mr
twist
received
this
a
little
coldly
and
said
it
was
not
a
matter
of
taste
but
of
necessity
the
miss
twinklers
were
orphans
and
he
had
been
asked
he
cleared
his
throat
asked
by
their
relatives
by
in
fact
their
uncle
in
england
to
take
over
their
guardianship
and
see
that
they
came
to
no
harm
the
lawyer
nodded
intelligently
and
said
that
if
a
man
had
wards
at
all
they
might
as
well
be
cute
wards
mr
twist
did
like
this
either
and
said
briefly
that
he
had
had
no
choice
the
lawyer
said
quite
so
quite
so
and
continued
to
look
at
him
intelligently
mr
twist
then
explained
that
he
had
come
to
him
rather
than
as
might
have
been
more
natural
to
the
solicitor
who
had
arranged
the
purchase
of
the
cottage
because
this
was
a
private
and
personal
matter
quite
so
quite
so
interrupted
the
lawyer
with
really
almost
too
much
intelligence
mr
twist
felt
the
excess
of
it
and
tried
to
look
dignified
but
the
lawyer
was
bent
on
being
friendly
and
frank
friendliness
was
natural
to
him
when
visited
for
the
first
time
by
a
new
client
and
that
there
should
be
frankness
between
lawyers
and
clients
he
considered
essential
if
he
held
the
client
would
be
frank
then
the
lawyer
must
be
and
he
must
go
on
being
so
till
the
client
came
out
of
his
reserve
mr
twist
however
was
so
obstinate
in
his
reserve
that
the
lawyer
cheerfully
and
unhesitatingly
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
must
have
some
very
weak
spots
about
it
somewhere
there
another
way
out
of
it
of
course
mr
twist
he
said
when
he
had
done
rapidly
describing
the
different
steps
to
be
taken
there
were
not
many
steps
the
process
of
turning
oneself
into
a
guardian
was
surprisingly
simple
and
swift
out
of
it
said
mr
twist
his
spectacles
looking
very
big
and
astonished
out
of
what
out
of
your
little
difficulty
i
wonder
it
has
occurred
to
you
upon
my
word
now
i
do
wonder
but
i
not
in
any
little
diff
began
mr
twist
the
elder
of
these
two
girls
now
there
is
an
elder
said
mr
twist
come
come
said
the
lawyer
patiently
waiting
for
him
to
be
sensible
there
is
an
elder
repeated
mr
twist
they
twins
twins
are
they
well
i
must
say
we
manage
to
match
up
our
twins
better
than
that
over
here
but
come
now
has
it
occurred
to
you
you
might
marry
one
of
them
and
so
become
quite
naturally
related
to
them
both
mr
twist
spectacles
seemed
to
grow
gigantic
marry
one
of
them
he
repeated
his
mouth
helplessly
opening
yep
said
the
lawyer
giving
him
a
lead
in
look
here
said
mr
twist
suddenly
gathering
his
mouth
together
cut
that
line
of
joke
out
i
here
on
serious
business
i
have
come
to
be
facetious
least
of
all
about
those
children
quite
so
quite
so
interrupted
the
lawyer
pleasantly
children
you
call
them
how
old
are
they
seventeen
my
wife
was
sixteen
when
we
married
oh
quite
so
quite
so
certainly
by
all
means
well
then
they
to
be
your
wards
and
you
do
want
it
known
how
recently
they
become
your
wards
i
did
say
that
said
mr
twist
quite
so
quite
so
but
it
your
wish
is
it
the
relationship
is
to
look
as
as
possible
well
i
shall
be
dumb
of
course
but
most
things
get
into
the
press
here
let
me
see
he
pulled
a
sheet
of
paper
towards
him
and
took
up
his
fountain
pen
just
oblige
me
with
particulars
date
of
birth
place
of
birth
parentage
he
looked
up
ready
to
write
waiting
for
the
answers
none
came
i
ca
tell
you
off
hand
said
mr
twist
presently
his
forehead
puckered
ah
said
the
lawyer
laying
down
his
pen
quite
so
not
known
your
young
friends
long
enough
yet
i
known
them
quite
long
enough
said
mr
twist
stiffly
but
we
happen
to
have
found
more
alive
topics
of
conversation
than
dates
and
parents
ah
parents
not
alive
unfortunately
they
are
not
if
they
were
these
poor
children
be
knocking
about
in
a
strange
country
where
would
they
be
asked
the
lawyer
balancing
his
pen
across
his
forefinger
mr
twist
looked
at
him
very
straight
vividly
he
remembered
his
mother
peculiar
horror
when
he
told
her
the
girls
he
was
throwing
away
his
home
life
for
and
breaking
her
heart
over
were
germans
it
had
acted
upon
her
like
the
last
straw
and
since
then
he
had
felt
everywhere
with
every
one
he
talked
to
in
every
newspaper
he
read
the
same
strong
hostility
to
germans
so
much
stronger
than
when
he
left
america
the
year
before
mr
twist
began
to
perceive
that
he
had
been
impetuous
in
this
matter
of
the
guardianship
he
had
considered
it
enough
he
suddenly
saw
innumerable
difficulties
for
the
twins
and
for
the
open
arms
if
it
was
known
it
was
run
by
germans
better
abandon
the
guardianship
idea
than
that
such
difficulties
should
arise
he
had
thought
he
had
had
time
properly
to
think
he
had
been
so
hustled
and
busy
the
last
few
days
they
come
from
england
he
said
looking
at
the
lawyer
very
straight
ah
said
the
lawyer
mr
twist
was
going
to
lie
about
the
twins
but
merely
by
evading
he
hoped
to
put
off
the
day
when
their
nationality
would
be
known
perhaps
it
never
would
be
known
or
if
known
known
later
on
when
everybody
as
everybody
must
who
knew
them
loved
them
for
themselves
and
accordingly
would
care
quite
so
said
the
lawyer
again
nodding
i
asked
because
i
overheard
them
talking
the
other
day
as
they
passed
through
the
hall
of
your
hotel
they
were
talking
about
a
canary
the
r
in
the
word
seemed
a
little
rough
not
quite
english
mr
twist
not
quite
american
not
quite
agreed
mr
twist
they
been
a
good
deal
abroad
quite
so
at
school
no
doubt
he
was
silent
a
moment
intelligently
balancing
his
pen
on
his
forefinger
then
these
particulars
he
went
on
looking
up
at
mr
twist
could
you
let
me
have
them
soon
i
tell
you
what
you
in
a
hurry
to
fix
this
i
call
round
at
the
hotel
and
get
them
direct
from
your
young
friends
save
time
and
make
me
acquainted
with
a
pair
of
charming
girls
no
said
mr
twist
he
got
on
to
his
feet
and
held
out
his
hand
not
we
engaged
will
be
soon
enough
send
round
i
let
you
know
i
believe
i
going
to
think
it
over
a
bit
there
is
any
such
terrible
hurry
anyhow
there
is
i
understood
i
mean
a
day
or
two
more
or
less
do
figure
out
at
much
in
the
long
run
quite
so
quite
so
said
the
lawyer
getting
up
too
well
i
always
at
your
service
at
any
time
and
he
shook
hands
heartily
with
mr
twist
and
politely
opened
the
door
for
him
then
he
went
back
to
his
more
convinced
than
ever
that
there
was
something
very
weak
somewhere
about
the
as
for
mr
twist
he
perceived
he
had
been
a
fool
why
had
he
gone
to
the
lawyer
at
all
why
not
simply
have
announced
to
the
world
that
he
was
the
twinkler
guardian
the
twins
themselves
would
have
believed
it
if
he
had
come
in
one
day
and
said
it
was
settled
and
nobody
outside
would
ever
have
dreamed
of
questioning
it
after
all
you
could
see
if
a
man
was
a
guardian
or
not
just
by
looking
at
him
well
he
would
do
no
more
about
it
it
was
much
too
difficult
bother
it
let
bilton
go
on
supposing
he
was
the
legal
guardian
of
her
charges
anyway
he
had
all
the
intentions
of
a
guardian
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
go
to
the
lawyer
curse
that
lawyer
now
he
knew
however
distinctly
and
frequently
he
mr
twist
might
say
he
was
the
twinkler
guardian
that
he
was
it
harassed
mr
twist
to
perceive
as
he
did
perceive
with
clearness
that
he
had
been
a
fool
but
the
twins
when
he
told
them
that
evening
that
owing
to
technical
difficulties
with
the
details
of
which
he
would
trouble
them
the
guardianship
was
off
were
pleased
we
want
to
be
bound
to
you
said
her
eyes
very
soft
and
her
voice
very
gentle
only
by
ties
of
affection
and
gratitude
and
turning
red
opened
her
mouth
as
though
she
were
going
to
say
something
handsome
like
that
too
but
seemed
unable
after
all
to
get
it
out
and
only
said
rather
inaudibly
yes
chapter
xxiv
yet
another
harassing
experience
awaited
mr
twist
before
the
end
of
that
week
it
had
been
from
the
first
his
anxious
concern
that
nothing
should
occur
at
the
cosmopolitan
to
get
his
party
under
a
cloud
yet
it
did
get
under
a
cloud
and
on
the
very
last
afternoon
too
before
arrival
only
hours
more
and
her
respectability
would
have
spread
over
the
twins
like
a
white
whig
they
would
have
been
safe
his
party
would
have
been
unassailable
but
no
those
twinklers
in
spite
of
his
exhortation
whenever
he
had
a
minute
left
to
exhort
in
could
it
seemed
refrain
from
twinkling
the
word
in
mr
mind
covered
the
whole
of
their
easy
friendliness
their
flow
of
language
their
affable
desire
to
explain
he
had
kept
them
with
him
as
much
as
he
could
and
luckily
the
excited
interest
they
took
in
the
progress
of
the
inn
made
them
happy
to
hang
about
it
most
of
the
time
of
the
delicate
and
dangerous
week
before
bilton
came
but
they
too
had
things
to
do
shopping
in
acapulco
choosing
the
linen
frocks
and
muslin
caps
and
aprons
in
which
they
were
to
wait
at
tea
and
buying
the
cushions
and
and
canary
that
came
under
the
general
heading
in
speech
of
feminine
touches
so
they
sometimes
left
him
and
he
never
saw
them
go
without
a
qualm
mind
and
not
say
anything
to
anybody
about
this
wo
you
he
would
say
hastily
making
a
comprehensive
gesture
towards
the
cottage
as
they
went
of
course
we
wo
i
meant
nobody
is
to
know
what
it
really
going
to
be
they
to
think
it
just
a
it
would
most
ruin
my
advertisement
scheme
if
they
but
of
we
wo
have
we
ever
the
twins
would
answer
looking
very
smug
and
sure
of
themselves
no
not
yet
but
and
the
hustled
man
would
plunge
again
into
technicalities
with
whichever
expert
was
at
that
moment
with
him
leaving
the
twins
as
he
needs
must
to
god
and
their
own
discretion
discretion
he
already
amply
knew
was
not
a
twinkler
characteristic
but
the
week
passed
bilton
arrival
grew
near
and
nothing
had
happened
it
was
plain
to
the
watchful
mr
twist
from
the
pleasant
looks
of
the
other
guests
when
the
twins
went
in
and
out
of
the
restaurant
to
meals
that
nothing
had
happened
his
heart
grew
lighter
on
the
last
afternoon
when
bilton
was
actually
due
next
day
his
heart
was
quite
light
and
he
saw
them
leave
him
to
go
back
and
rest
at
the
hotel
because
they
were
tired
by
the
accumulated
standing
about
of
the
week
altogether
unconcernedly
the
attitude
of
the
cosmopolitan
guests
towards
the
twins
was
indeed
one
of
complete
benevolence
they
did
even
mind
the
canary
who
would
not
be
indulgent
towards
two
such
sweet
little
girls
and
their
pet
bird
even
if
it
did
sing
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
without
stopping
the
twinkler
girls
were
like
two
little
bits
of
sunlight
or
bits
of
white
blossom
blowing
in
and
out
of
the
hotel
in
their
shining
youth
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
regard
them
indulgently
but
if
the
guests
were
indulgent
they
were
also
inquisitive
everybody
knew
who
mr
twist
was
who
however
were
the
twinklers
were
they
relations
of
his
charges
the
social
column
of
the
acapulco
daily
paper
from
which
information
as
to
new
arrivals
was
usually
got
had
as
we
know
in
its
embarrassment
at
being
ignorant
to
take
refuge
in
french
because
french
may
so
easily
be
supposed
to
mean
something
the
paper
had
little
knowledge
of
but
much
confidence
in
french
had
seemed
to
it
as
good
a
word
as
any
other
as
indeed
did
it
had
hesitated
between
the
two
but
finally
chose
because
there
happened
to
be
no
accent
in
its
stock
of
type
the
cosmopolitan
guests
were
amused
at
the
word
and
though
inquisitive
were
altogether
amiable
and
until
the
last
afternoon
only
the
manager
did
like
the
twinklers
he
like
them
because
of
the
canary
his
sympathies
had
been
alienated
from
the
miss
twinklers
the
moment
he
heard
through
the
chambermaid
that
they
had
tied
the
heavy
canary
cage
on
to
the
hanging
electric
light
in
their
bedroom
he
said
nothing
of
course
one
does
say
anything
if
one
is
an
hotel
manager
until
the
unique
and
final
moment
when
one
says
everything
on
the
last
afternoon
before
bilton
advent
the
twins
tired
of
standing
about
for
days
at
the
cottage
and
in
shops
appeared
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
and
sat
down
to
rest
they
did
go
to
their
room
to
rest
because
they
did
feel
inclined
for
the
canary
and
they
sat
down
very
happily
in
the
comfortable
with
which
the
big
hall
abounded
and
propping
their
dusty
feet
on
the
lower
bar
of
a
small
table
with
friendly
and
interested
eyes
they
observed
the
other
guests
the
other
guests
also
observed
them
it
was
the
first
time
the
had
appeared
without
its
companion
and
the
other
guests
were
dying
to
know
details
about
it
it
had
been
sitting
in
the
hall
five
minutes
before
a
genial
old
gentleman
caught
friendly
eye
and
instantly
drew
up
his
chair
uncle
gone
off
by
himself
he
asked
for
he
was
of
the
party
in
the
hotel
which
inclined
in
spite
of
the
marked
difference
in
profiles
to
the
relationship
theory
and
he
made
a
shot
at
the
relationship
being
that
of
uncle
we
have
got
an
uncle
nearer
than
england
said
affably
and
we
only
got
him
by
accident
said
equally
affably
it
was
an
unfortunate
accident
said
considering
her
memories
indeed
said
the
old
gentleman
indeed
how
was
that
by
the
usual
method
if
an
uncle
is
a
blood
uncle
said
we
happened
to
have
a
marriageable
aunt
and
he
married
her
so
we
have
to
have
him
it
was
sheer
bad
luck
said
again
brooding
on
that
distant
image
yes
said
just
bad
luck
he
might
so
easily
have
married
some
one
else
aunt
but
no
his
roving
glance
must
needs
go
and
fall
on
ours
indeed
said
the
old
gentleman
indeed
and
he
ruminated
on
this
with
an
affectionate
eye
he
was
affectionate
resting
in
turn
on
each
anna
then
mr
twist
he
went
on
presently
we
all
know
him
of
course
a
public
benefactor
yes
he
said
radiantly
a
boon
to
the
yes
he
said
again
all
asparkle
he
so
pleasant
at
breakfast
then
he
mr
twist
teapot
twist
we
call
him
where
i
live
teapot
twist
said
i
think
that
irreverent
not
at
all
it
a
pet
name
a
sign
of
our
affection
and
gratitude
then
he
is
your
uncle
we
have
got
a
real
uncle
nearer
than
heaven
said
her
cheek
on
her
hand
dreamily
reconstructing
the
image
of
onkel
indeed
said
the
old
gentleman
indeed
and
he
ruminated
on
this
too
his
thirsty
heart
he
had
a
thirsty
heart
and
found
difficulty
in
slaking
it
because
of
his
wife
very
indulgent
toward
the
twins
then
he
said
that
a
long
way
off
what
is
asked
the
place
your
uncle
in
not
too
far
really
said
softly
he
safe
there
he
was
very
old
and
was
difficult
to
look
after
why
he
got
there
at
last
through
his
own
carelessness
indeed
said
the
old
gentleman
sheer
carelessness
said
indeed
said
the
old
gentleman
how
was
that
well
you
see
where
we
lived
they
did
have
electric
light
began
and
one
night
the
the
night
he
went
to
heaven
he
put
the
petroleum
lamp
and
she
was
about
to
relate
that
dreadful
story
of
onkle
col
end
which
has
already
been
described
in
these
pages
as
unfit
for
anywhere
but
an
appendix
for
time
had
blunted
her
feelings
when
put
out
a
beseeching
hand
and
stopped
her
even
after
all
these
years
could
bear
to
remember
onkle
col
end
it
had
haunted
her
childhood
it
had
licked
about
her
dreams
in
leaping
tongues
of
flame
and
it
was
only
tongues
of
flame
there
were
circumstances
connected
with
it
only
quite
recently
since
the
war
had
damped
down
lesser
horrors
had
she
got
rid
of
it
she
could
at
least
now
talk
of
him
calmly
and
also
speculate
with
pleasure
on
the
probable
aspect
of
onkle
col
in
glory
but
she
still
could
bear
to
hear
the
details
of
his
end
at
this
point
an
elderly
lady
of
the
spare
and
active
type
very
upright
and
much
wrinkled
that
america
seems
so
freely
to
produce
came
down
the
stairs
and
seeing
the
twins
talking
to
the
old
gentleman
crossed
straight
over
and
sat
down
briskly
next
to
them
smiling
benevolently
well
if
ridding
can
talk
to
you
i
guess
so
can
i
she
said
pulling
her
knitting
out
of
a
brocaded
bag
and
nodding
and
smiling
at
the
group
she
was
knitting
socks
for
the
allied
armies
in
france
the
next
winter
but
it
being
warm
just
then
in
california
they
were
cotton
socks
because
wool
made
her
hands
too
hot
the
twins
were
all
polite
reciprocal
smiles
i
just
crazy
to
hear
about
you
said
the
brisk
lady
knitting
with
incredible
energy
while
her
smiles
flicked
over
everybody
fresh
from
europe
are
you
what
say
quite
fresh
my
are
you
cute
little
things
thinking
of
making
a
long
stay
in
the
states

for
the
rest
of
your
lives
why
now
i
call
that
just
splendid
parents
coming
out
west
soon
too

i
guess

wo
let
themselves
be
prevented
long
mr
twist
looking
after
you
meanwhile
what
say
there
is
any
meanwhile
well
i
do
quite
mr
twist
your
uncle
or
cousin
what
say

relation

h
no
relation
at
all

he
well
i
guess

an
old
friend
of
your
parents
then
what
say
they
did
know
him
h
h
they
know
him
did
they
well
i
do
quite
what
say
but
you
know
him
yes
yes
so
i
see
h
h
i
do
quite
her
needles
flew
in
and
out
and
her
ball
of
cotton
rolled
on
to
the
floor
in
her
surprise
got
up
and
fetched
it
for
her
before
the
old
gentleman
who
was
gazing
with
thirsty
appreciation
at
could
struggle
out
of
his
chair
you
see
explained
taking
advantage
of
the
silence
that
had
fallen
on
the
lady
mr
twist
regarded
as
a
man
is
old
but
regarded
as
a
friend
he
is
new
brand
new
said
h
h
said
the
lady
knitting
faster
than
ever
and
looking
first
at
one
twin
and
then
at
the
other
h
h
h
brand
new
is
he
well
i
do
quite
her
smiles
had
now
to
struggle
with
the
uncertainty
and
doubt
and
were
weakening
visibly
say
now
where
did
you
meet
teapot
twist
asked
the
old
gentleman
who
was
surprised
too
but
remained
quite
benevolent
owing
to
his
affectionate
heart
and
his
not
being
a
lady
we
met
mr
twist
said
who
objected
to
this
way
of
alluding
to
him
on
the
steamer
not
before
you
did
meet
mr
twist
before
the
steamer
exclaimed
the
lady
the
last
of
her
smiles
flickering
out
not
before
the
steamer
did
you
just
a
steamship
acquaintance
parents
never
seen
him
h
h
h
we
would
have
met
him
before
if
we
could
said
earnestly
i
should
think
so
said
it
has
been
the
great
retrospective
loss
of
our
lives
meeting
him
so
late
in
them
why
now
said
the
old
gentleman
smiling
i
should
call
it
so
particularly
late
in
them
but
the
knitting
lady
did
smile
at
all
and
sat
up
very
straight
and
said
h
h
h
to
her
flashing
needles
as
they
flew
in
and
out
for
not
only
was
she
in
doubt
now
about
the
cute
little
things
but
she
also
regretted
on
behalf
of
the
old
gentleman
wife
who
was
a
friend
of
hers
the
alert
interest
of
his
manner
he
sat
there
so
very
much
awake
with
his
wife
he
never
seemed
awake
at
all
up
to
now
she
had
not
seen
him
except
with
his
wife
you
must
run
away
with
the
idea
that
we
younger
than
we
really
are
said
to
the
old
gentleman
why
no
i
wo
he
answered
with
a
liveliness
that
deepened
the
knitting
lady
regret
on
behalf
of
his
wife
when
i
run
away
you
bet
it
wo
be
with
an
idea
and
he
chuckled
he
was
quite
rosy
in
the
face
and
chuckled
he
whom
she
knew
only
as
a
quiet
man
with
no
chuckle
in
him
and
was
what
he
had
just
said
very
like
what
the
french
call
a
entendre
she
had
a
husband
herself
but
if
she
had
she
would
wish
him
to
be
at
least
as
quiet
when
away
from
her
as
when
with
her
and
at
least
as
free
from
at
least
really
more
h
h
h
she
said
clicking
her
needles
and
looking
first
at
the
twins
and
then
at
the
old
gentleman
do
you
mean
to
say
you
crossed
the
atlantic
quite
alone
you
two
she
asked
in
order
to
prevent
his
continuing
on
these
remarkable
and
unusual
lines
of
quite
said
that
is
to
say
we
had
mr
twist
of
course
said
once
we
had
got
him
amended
yes
yes
said
the
knitting
lady
so
you
say
h
h
h
once
you
had
got
him
i
do
quite
well
i
call
you
a
pair
of
fine
girls
said
the
old
gentleman
heartily
interrupting
in
his
turn
and
all
i
can
say
is
i
wish
i
had
been
on
that
boat
here
ridding
said
the
knitting
lady
quickly
relief
in
her
voice
whereupon
he
suddenly
grew
quiet
my
ridding
she
added
when
the
lady
drew
within
speaking
distance
you
do
look
as
though
you
needed
a
rest
ridding
the
wife
of
the
old
gentleman
ridding
had
been
approaching
slowly
for
some
time
from
behind
she
had
been
out
on
the
verandah
since
lunch
trying
to
recover
from
it
that
was
the
one
drawback
to
meals
she
considered
that
they
required
so
much
recovering
from
and
the
nicer
they
were
the
longer
it
took
the
meals
at
the
cosmopolitan
were
particularly
nice
and
really
all
one
time
was
taken
up
getting
over
them
she
was
a
lady
whose
figure
seemed
to
be
all
meals
the
old
gentleman
had
married
her
in
her
youth
when
she
had
had
time
to
have
had
so
many
he
and
she
were
then
the
same
age
and
unfortunately
had
gone
on
being
the
same
age
since
it
had
wrecked
his
life
this
inability
of
his
wife
to
stay
as
young
and
new
as
himself
he
wanted
a
young
wife
and
the
older
he
got
in
years
his
heart
very
awkwardly
retained
its
early
freshness
the
younger
he
wanted
her
and
instead
the
older
he
got
the
older
his
wife
got
too
also
the
less
new
the
old
gentleman
felt
the
whole
thing
was
a
dreadful
mistake
why
should
he
have
to
be
married
to
this
old
lady
never
in
his
life
had
he
wanted
to
marry
old
ladies
and
he
thought
it
very
hard
that
at
an
age
when
he
most
appreciated
bright
youth
he
should
be
forced
to
spend
his
precious
years
his
crowning
years
when
his
mind
had
attained
wisdom
while
his
heart
retained
freshness
stranded
with
an
old
lady
of
costly
habits
and
inordinate
bulk
just
because
years
ago
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
chance
pretty
girl
he
struggled
politely
out
of
his
chair
on
seeing
her
the
twins
impressed
by
such
venerable
abundance
got
up
too
albert
if
you
try
to
move
too
quick
you
crick
your
back
again
said
ridding
in
a
monotonous
voice
letting
herself
down
carefully
and
a
little
breathlessly
on
to
the
edge
of
a
chair
that
did
rock
and
fanning
herself
with
a
small
fan
she
carried
on
the
end
of
a
massive
gold
chain
her
fatigued
eyes
explored
the
twins
while
she
spoke
i
ca
get
ridding
to
remember
that
we
neither
of
us
as
young
as
we
were
she
went
on
addressing
the
knitting
lady
but
with
her
eyes
continuing
to
explore
the
twins
they
naturally
thought
she
was
speaking
to
them
and
said
politely
really
and
feeling
she
too
ought
to
make
some
comment
said
is
that
very
unusual
aunt
alice
always
said
is
that
very
unusual
when
she
did
know
what
else
to
say
and
it
worked
beautifully
because
then
the
other
person
launched
into
affirmations
or
denials
with
the
reasons
for
them
and
was
quite
happy
but
ridding
only
stared
at
the
twins
heavily
and
in
silence
because
explained
who
thought
the
old
lady
did
quite
follow
nobody
ever
is
so
that
it
must
be
difficult
not
to
remember
it
ridding
too
was
silent
but
that
was
because
of
his
wife
it
was
quite
untrue
to
say
that
he
forgot
seeing
that
she
was
constantly
reminding
him
old
stranger
he
thought
resentfully
as
he
carefully
arranged
a
cushion
behind
her
back
he
did
like
her
back
why
should
he
have
to
pay
bills
for
putting
expensive
clothes
on
it
he
did
want
to
it
was
all
a
dreadful
mistake
you
the
twinkler
girls
said
the
old
lady
abruptly
they
made
polite
gestures
of
agreement
the
knitting
lady
knitted
vigorously
sitting
up
very
straight
and
saying
nothing
with
a
look
on
her
face
of
disclaiming
every
responsibility
where
does
your
family
come
from
was
the
next
question
this
was
unexpected
the
twins
had
no
desire
to
talk
of
pomerania
they
had
wanted
to
talk
about
pomerania
once
since
the
war
began
and
they
felt
very
distinctly
in
their
bones
that
america
though
she
was
a
neutral
did
like
germany
any
more
than
the
belligerents
did
it
had
been
their
intention
to
arrange
together
the
line
they
would
take
if
asked
questions
of
this
sort
but
life
had
been
so
full
and
so
exciting
since
their
arrival
that
they
had
forgotten
to
found
herself
unable
to
say
anything
at
all
therefore
observing
that
christopher
was
unnerved
plunged
in
our
family
she
said
gently
can
hardly
be
said
to
come
so
much
as
to
have
been
the
old
lady
thought
this
over
her
lustreless
eyes
on
face
the
knitting
lady
clicked
away
very
fast
content
to
leave
the
management
of
the
twinklers
in
more
competent
hands
how
that
asked
the
old
lady
finally
deciding
that
she
understood
it
extinct
said
except
us
that
is
in
the
direct
line
the
old
lady
was
a
little
impressed
by
this
direct
lines
not
being
so
numerous
or
so
clear
in
america
as
in
some
other
countries
you
mean
you
two
are
the
only
twinklers
left
she
asked
the
only
ones
left
that
matter
said
there
are
branches
of
twinklers
still
existing
i
believe
but
they
so
unimportant
that
we
do
know
them
mere
twigs
said
recovering
her
nerves
on
seeing
handle
the
situation
so
skilfully
and
her
nose
unconsciously
gave
a
slight
junker
lift
have
you
got
any
parents
asked
the
old
lady
we
used
to
have
said
flushing
afraid
that
her
darling
mother
was
going
to
be
asked
about
the
old
gentleman
gave
a
sudden
chuckle
why
yes
he
said
forgetting
his
wife
presence
for
an
instant
i
guess
you
had
them
once
or
i
do
see
how
albert
said
his
wife
we
are
the
sole
surviving
examples
of
the
direct
line
of
twinklers
said
now
quite
herself
and
ready
to
give
columbus
a
hand
there
just
us
and
we
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
plunged
we
come
from
england
do
you
said
the
old
lady
now
i
should
have
said
that
i
say
just
why
but
i
should
should
you
miss
heap
i
should
say
a
good
many
things
ridding
said
miss
heap
enigmatically
her
needles
flying
it
because
we
been
abroad
a
great
deal
with
our
parents
i
expect
said
rather
quickly
i
daresay
it
has
left
its
mark
on
us
everything
leaves
its
mark
on
one
observed
pleasantly
ah
said
the
old
lady
i
know
what
it
is
now
it
the
foreign
you
picked
it
up
have
they
miss
heap
i
should
like
to
say
what
they
have
picked
up
ridding
said
miss
heap
again
enigmatically
i
afraid
we
have
said
turning
red
we
been
told
that
before
it
seems
to
stick
once
one
has
picked
it
up
and
the
old
gentleman
muttered
that
everything
stuck
once
one
had
picked
it
up
and
looked
resentfully
at
his
wife
she
moved
her
slow
eyes
round
and
let
them
rest
on
him
a
moment
albert
if
you
talk
so
much
you
wo
be
able
to
sleep
she
said
i
ca
get
ridding
to
remember
we
got
to
be
careful
at
our
age
she
added
to
the
knitting
lady
you
seem
to
be
bothered
by
your
memory
said
politely
addressing
the
old
gentleman
have
you
ever
tried
making
notes
on
little
bits
of
paper
of
the
things
you
have
to
remember
i
think
you
would
probably
be
all
right
then
uncle
arthur
used
to
do
that
or
rather
he
made
aunt
alice
do
it
for
him
and
put
them
where
he
would
see
them
uncle
arthur
explained
to
the
old
lady
is
an
uncle
of
ours
the
one
she
said
turning
to
the
old
gentleman
we
were
just
telling
you
about
who
so
unfortunately
insisted
on
marrying
our
aunt
uncle
that
is
by
courtesy
she
added
turning
to
the
old
lady
not
by
blood
the
old
lady
eyes
moved
from
one
twin
to
the
other
as
each
one
spoke
but
she
said
nothing
but
aunt
alice
said
is
our
genuine
aunt
well
i
was
going
to
tell
you
she
continued
briskly
addressing
the
old
gentleman
there
used
to
be
things
uncle
arthur
had
to
do
every
day
and
every
week
but
still
he
had
to
be
reminded
of
them
each
time
and
aunt
alice
had
a
whole
set
of
the
regular
ones
written
out
on
bits
of
cardboard
and
brought
them
out
in
turn
the
monday
morning
one
was
wind
the
clock
and
the
sunday
morning
one
was
take
your
hot
bath
and
the
saturday
evening
one
was
remember
your
pill
and
there
was
one
brought
in
regularly
every
morning
with
his
shaving
water
and
stuck
in
his
put
on
your
abdominable
belt
the
knitting
needles
paused
an
instant
yes
joined
in
interested
by
these
recollections
her
long
limbs
sunk
in
her
chair
in
a
position
of
great
ease
and
comfort
and
it
seemed
to
us
so
funny
for
him
to
have
to
be
reminded
to
put
on
what
was
really
a
part
of
his
clothes
every
day
that
once
we
wrote
a
slip
of
our
own
for
him
and
left
it
on
his
do
forget
your
trousers
the
knitting
needles
paused
again
but
the
results
of
that
were
dreadful
added
her
face
sobering
at
the
thought
of
them
yes
said
you
see
he
supposed
aunt
alice
had
done
it
in
a
fit
of
high
spirits
though
she
never
had
high
spirits
and
would
have
been
allowed
to
if
she
had
explained
and
he
thought
she
was
laughing
at
him
said
though
we
have
never
seen
her
laugh
and
i
do
believe
he
has
either
said
so
there
was
trouble
because
he
could
bear
the
idea
of
her
laughing
at
him
and
we
had
to
confess
but
that
did
make
it
any
better
for
aunt
alice
no
because
then
he
said
it
was
her
fault
anyhow
for
not
keeping
us
stricter
so
said
after
the
house
had
been
steeped
in
a
sulphurous
gloom
for
over
a
week
and
we
all
felt
as
though
we
were
being
slowly
and
steadily
gassed
we
tried
to
make
it
up
by
writing
a
final
one
a
nice
one
and
leaving
it
on
his
plate
at
breakfast
kiss
your
wife
but
instead
of
kissing
her
he
she
broke
off
and
then
finished
a
little
vaguely
oh
well
he
did
still
remarked
it
must
be
pleasant
not
to
be
kissed
by
a
husband
aunt
alice
always
wanted
him
to
strange
to
say
which
is
why
we
reminded
him
of
it
he
used
to
forget
that
more
regularly
than
almost
anything
and
the
people
who
lived
in
the
house
nearest
us
were
just
the
opposite
the
husband
was
for
ever
trying
to
kiss
the
person
who
was
his
wife
and
she
was
for
ever
dodging
him
yes
said
like
the
people
on
keats
grecian
urn
yes
said
and
that
sort
of
husband
must
be
even
worse
oh
much
worse
agreed
she
looked
round
amiably
at
the
three
quiet
figures
in
the
chairs
i
shall
refrain
altogether
from
husbands
she
said
placidly
i
shall
take
something
that
does
kiss
and
she
fell
into
an
abstraction
wondering
with
her
cheek
resting
on
her
hand
what
he
or
it
would
look
like
there
was
a
pause
was
wondering
too
what
sort
of
a
creature
columbus
had
in
her
mind
and
how
many
if
any
legs
it
would
have
and
the
other
three
were
as
before
silent
then
the
old
lady
said
albert
and
put
out
her
hand
to
be
helped
on
to
her
feet
the
old
gentleman
struggled
out
of
his
chair
and
helped
her
up
his
face
had
a
congested
look
as
if
he
were
with
difficulty
keeping
back
things
he
wanted
to
say
miss
heap
got
up
too
stuffing
her
knitting
as
she
did
so
into
her
brocaded
bag
go
on
ahead
and
ring
the
elevator
bell
albert
said
the
old
lady
it
time
we
went
and
had
our
nap
i
ai
going
to
said
the
old
gentleman
suddenly
what
say
what
ai
you
going
to
albert
said
the
old
lady
turning
her
slow
eyes
round
to
him
nap
said
the
old
gentleman
his
face
very
red
it
was
intolerable
to
have
to
go
and
nap
he
wished
to
stay
where
he
was
and
talk
to
the
twins
why
should
he
have
to
nap
because
somebody
else
wanted
to
why
should
he
have
to
nap
with
an
old
lady
anyway
never
in
his
life
had
he
wanted
to
nap
with
old
ladies
it
was
all
a
dreadful
mistake
albert
said
his
wife
looking
at
him
he
went
on
ahead
and
rang
the
you
quite
right
to
see
that
he
rests
ridding
said
miss
heap
walking
away
with
her
and
slowing
her
steps
to
suit
hers
i
should
say
it
was
essential
that
he
should
be
kept
quiet
in
the
afternoons
you
should
see
that
ridding
rests
more
than
he
does
more
she
added
significantly
i
ca
get
ridding
to
remember
that
we
neither
of
us
this
was
the
last
the
twins
heard
they
too
had
politely
got
out
of
their
chairs
when
the
old
lady
began
to
heave
into
activity
and
they
stood
watching
the
three
departing
figures
they
were
a
little
surprised
surely
they
had
all
been
in
the
middle
of
an
interesting
conversation
perhaps
it
american
to
go
away
in
the
middle
remarked
following
the
group
with
her
eyes
as
it
moved
toward
the
lift
perhaps
it
is
said
also
gazing
after
it
the
old
gentleman
in
the
brief
moment
during
which
the
two
ladies
had
their
backs
to
him
while
preceding
him
into
the
lift
turned
quickly
round
on
his
heels
and
waved
his
hand
before
he
himself
went
in
the
twins
laughed
and
waved
back
and
they
waved
with
such
goodwill
that
the
old
gentleman
could
resist
giving
one
more
wave
he
was
seen
doing
it
by
the
two
ladies
as
they
faced
round
and
his
wife
as
she
let
herself
down
on
to
the
edge
of
the
seat
remarked
that
he
must
exert
himself
like
that
or
he
would
have
to
begin
taking
his
drops
again
that
was
all
she
said
in
the
lift
but
in
their
room
when
she
had
got
her
breath
again
she
said
albert
there
just
one
thing
in
the
world
i
hate
worse
than
a
fool
and
that
an
old
fool
chapter
xxv
that
evening
while
the
twins
were
undressing
a
message
came
up
from
the
office
that
the
manager
would
be
obliged
if
the
miss
canary
would
sing
but
it
ca
help
it
said
through
the
crack
of
door
she
held
open
she
was
already
in
her
nightgown
you
would
either
if
you
were
a
canary
she
added
reasoning
with
the
messenger
it
just
got
to
help
it
said
he
but
why
should
it
sing
complaints
but
it
always
has
sung
that
is
so
and
it
has
sung
once
too
often
it
unpopular
in
this
hotel
that
canary
of
yours
it
just
got
to
rest
a
while
take
it
easy
sit
quiet
on
its
perch
and
think
but
it
wo
sit
quiet
and
think
well
i
told
you
he
said
going
away
this
was
the
bird
that
had
been
seen
arriving
at
the
cosmopolitan
about
a
week
before
by
the
lawyer
and
it
had
piercingly
sung
ever
since
it
sang
that
is
as
long
as
there
was
any
light
real
or
artificial
to
sing
by
the
boy
who
carried
it
from
the
shop
for
the
twins
said
its
cage
was
to
be
hung
in
a
window
in
the
sun
or
it
could
do
itself
justice
but
electric
light
also
enabled
it
to
do
itself
justice
the
twins
discovered
and
if
they
sat
up
late
the
canary
sat
up
late
too
singing
as
loudly
and
as
mechanically
as
if
it
had
been
a
real
canary
at
all
but
something
clever
and
american
with
a
machine
inside
it
secretly
the
twins
did
like
it
shocked
at
its
loud
behaviour
they
had
very
soon
agreed
that
it
was
no
lady
but
was
determined
to
have
it
at
the
open
arms
because
of
her
conviction
that
no
house
showing
the
trail
of
a
woman
hand
was
without
a
canary
that
and
a
workbag
she
bought
them
both
the
same
day
the
workbag
did
matter
because
it
kept
quiet
but
the
canary
was
a
very
big
very
yellow
bird
much
bigger
and
yellower
than
the
frailer
canaries
of
a
more
exhausted
civilization
and
quite
incapable
unless
it
was
pitch
dark
of
keeping
quiet
for
a
minute
evidently
as
said
it
had
a
great
many
lungs
her
idea
of
lungs
in
spite
of
her
time
among
them
and
similar
objects
at
a
hospital
was
what
it
had
always
been
that
they
were
things
like
pink
macaroni
strung
across
a
frame
of
bones
on
the
principle
of
a
lyre
or
harp
and
producing
noises
she
thought
the
canary
had
unusual
numbers
of
these
pink
strings
and
all
of
them
of
the
biggest
and
dearest
kind
of
macaroni
the
other
guests
at
the
cosmopolitan
had
been
rather
restive
from
the
first
on
account
of
this
bird
but
felt
so
indulgent
toward
its
owners
those
cute
little
relations
or
charges
or
whatever
they
were
of
teapot
twist
that
they
bore
its
singing
without
complaint
but
on
the
evening
of
the
day
the
annas
had
the
interesting
conversation
with
and
ridding
and
miss
heap
two
definite
complaints
were
lodged
in
the
office
and
one
was
from
ridding
and
the
other
was
from
miss
heap
the
manager
as
has
been
said
was
already
sensitive
about
the
canary
its
cage
was
straining
his
electric
light
cord
and
its
food
assiduously
administered
in
quantities
exceeding
its
capacity
littered
the
expensive
pink
pile
carpet
he
therefore
lent
a
ready
ear
and
sent
up
a
peremptory
message
and
while
the
message
was
going
up
miss
heap
who
had
come
herself
with
her
complaint
stayed
on
discussing
the
twist
and
twinkler
party
she
said
nothing
really
she
merely
asked
questions
and
not
one
of
the
questions
now
they
were
put
to
him
did
the
manager
find
he
could
answer
no
doubt
everything
was
all
right
everybody
knew
about
mr
twist
and
it
was
likely
he
would
choose
an
hotel
of
so
high
a
class
to
stay
in
if
his
relations
to
the
miss
twinklers
were
anything
but
regular
and
a
lady
companion
he
understood
was
joining
the
party
shortly
and
besides
there
was
the
house
being
got
ready
a
permanent
place
of
residence
he
gathered
in
which
the
party
would
settle
down
and
experience
had
taught
him
that
genuine
illicitness
was
never
permanent
still
the
manager
himself
had
really
cared
about
the
twinklers
since
the
canary
came
he
could
fill
the
hotel
very
easily
and
there
was
no
need
to
accommodate
people
who
spoilt
carpets
also
the
moment
the
least
doubt
or
question
arose
among
his
guests
all
of
whom
he
knew
and
most
of
whom
came
back
regularly
every
year
as
to
the
social
or
moral
status
of
any
new
arrivals
then
those
arrivals
must
go
miss
heap
evidently
had
doubts
her
standard
it
is
true
was
the
almost
impossibly
high
one
of
the
unmarried
lady
of
riper
years
but
ridding
he
understood
had
doubts
too
and
once
doubts
started
in
an
hotel
he
knew
from
experience
that
they
ran
through
it
like
measles
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
act
next
morning
therefore
he
briskly
appeared
in
mr
twist
room
as
he
was
pulling
on
his
boots
and
cheerfully
hoped
he
was
bearing
in
mind
what
he
had
been
told
the
day
he
took
the
rooms
that
they
were
engaged
for
the
date
of
the
month
now
arrived
at
mr
twist
paused
with
a
boot
half
on
i
not
bearing
it
in
mind
he
said
because
you
did
tell
me
oh
yes
i
did
mr
twist
said
the
manager
briskly
it
is
likely
i
make
a
mistake
about
that
the
rooms
are
taken
every
year
for
this
date
by
the
same
people
hart
of
boston
has
this
one
and
and
mr
twist
heard
no
more
he
finished
lacing
his
boots
in
silence
what
he
had
been
so
much
afraid
of
had
happened
he
and
the
twins
had
got
under
a
cloud
the
twins
had
been
saying
things
last
night
they
told
him
they
had
made
some
friends
he
had
been
uneasy
at
that
and
questioned
them
but
it
appeared
they
had
talked
chiefly
of
their
uncle
arthur
well
damnable
as
uncle
arthur
was
as
a
man
he
was
safe
enough
as
a
topic
of
conversation
he
was
english
he
was
known
to
people
in
america
like
the
delloggs
and
the
sacks
but
it
was
now
clear
they
must
have
said
things
besides
that
probably
they
had
expatiated
on
uncle
arthur
from
some
point
of
view
undesirable
to
american
ears
the
american
ear
was
very
susceptible
he
had
been
born
in
new
england
without
becoming
aware
of
that
mr
twist
tied
his
bootlaces
with
such
annoyance
that
he
got
them
into
knots
he
ought
never
to
have
come
with
the
annas
to
a
big
hotel
yet
lodgings
would
have
been
worse
why
had
that
gasbag
bilton
mr
twist
thoughts
were
sometimes
unjust
joined
them
sooner
why
had
that
shirker
dellogg
died
he
got
his
bootlaces
hopelessly
into
knots
i
like
to
start
right
in
getting
the
rooms
fixed
up
mr
twist
said
the
manager
pleasantly
hart
of
boston
is
very
see
here
said
mr
twist
straightening
himself
and
turning
the
full
light
of
his
big
spectacles
on
to
him
i
do
care
a
curse
for
hart
of
boston
the
manager
expressed
regret
that
mr
twist
should
connect
a
curse
with
a
lady
it
was
american
to
do
that
hart
damn
hart
said
mr
twist
who
had
become
of
speech
while
in
france
and
when
he
was
goaded
let
it
all
out
the
manager
went
away
and
so
two
hours
later
did
mr
twist
and
the
twins
i
do
know
what
you
been
saying
he
said
in
an
extremely
exasperated
voice
as
he
sat
opposite
them
in
the
taxi
with
their
grips
considerably
added
to
and
crowned
by
the
canary
who
was
singing
piled
up
round
him
saying
echoed
the
twins
their
eyes
very
round
but
whatever
it
was
you
have
done
better
to
say
something
else
confound
that
bird
does
it
ever
stop
screeching
it
was
the
twins
however
who
were
confounded
so
much
confounded
by
what
they
considered
his
unjust
severity
that
they
did
attempt
to
defend
themselves
but
sat
looking
at
him
with
proud
hurt
eyes
by
this
time
they
both
had
become
very
fond
of
mr
twist
and
accordingly
he
was
able
to
hurt
them
indeed
was
so
fond
of
him
that
she
actually
thought
him
handsome
she
had
boldly
said
so
to
the
astonished
about
a
week
before
and
when
was
silent
being
unable
to
agree
had
heatedly
explained
that
there
was
handsomeness
and
there
was
the
higher
handsomeness
and
that
that
was
the
one
mr
twist
had
it
was
infinitely
better
than
mere
handsomeness
said
curly
hair
and
a
straight
nose
and
the
rest
of
the
silly
stuff
because
it
was
real
and
lasting
and
it
was
real
and
lasting
because
it
lay
in
the
play
of
the
features
and
not
in
their
exact
position
and
shape
could
see
that
mr
twist
features
played
she
looked
at
him
now
in
the
taxi
while
he
angrily
stared
out
of
the
window
and
even
though
he
was
evidently
greatly
stirred
his
features
playing
she
did
particularly
want
them
to
play
she
was
fond
of
and
trusted
mr
twist
and
would
never
even
have
thought
whether
he
had
features
or
not
ii
had
taken
lately
to
talking
so
much
about
them
and
she
could
help
remembering
how
this
very
christopher
so
voluble
now
on
the
higher
handsomeness
had
said
on
board
the
when
first
commenting
on
mr
twist
that
god
must
have
got
tired
of
making
him
by
the
time
his
head
was
reached
well
christopher
had
always
been
an
idealist
when
she
was
eleven
she
had
violently
loved
the
coachman
had
ever
violently
loved
anybody
yet
and
seeing
like
this
now
about
mr
twist
made
her
wonder
when
she
too
was
going
to
begin
surely
it
was
time
she
hoped
her
inability
to
begin
was
perhaps
because
she
had
no
heart
still
she
could
begin
if
she
did
see
anybody
to
begin
on
she
sat
silent
in
the
taxi
with
christopher
equally
silent
beside
her
both
of
them
observing
mr
twist
through
lowered
eyelashes
watched
him
with
hurt
and
anxious
eyes
like
a
devoted
dog
who
has
been
kicked
without
cause
watched
him
in
a
more
detached
spirit
she
had
a
real
affection
for
him
but
it
was
not
she
was
sure
and
rather
regretted
an
affection
that
would
ever
be
likely
to
get
the
better
of
her
reason
it
was
because
he
was
so
old
of
course
she
thought
for
one
could
love
the
oldest
people
beginning
with
that
standard
example
of
age
the
it
was
because
she
liked
him
so
much
how
could
one
get
sentimental
over
and
love
somebody
one
so
thoroughly
liked
the
two
things
on
reflection
did
seem
to
combine
well
she
was
sure
for
instance
that
aunt
alice
had
loved
uncle
arthur
amazing
as
it
seemed
but
she
was
equally
sure
she
had
liked
him
and
look
at
the
one
loves
the
but
it
would
be
going
too
far
she
thought
to
say
that
one
likes
him
these
were
the
reflections
of
in
the
taxi
as
she
observed
through
her
eyelashes
the
object
of
idealization
she
envied
for
here
she
had
been
steadily
expanding
every
day
more
and
more
like
a
flower
under
the
influence
of
her
own
power
of
idealization
she
used
to
sparkle
and
grow
rosy
like
that
for
the
coachman
perhaps
after
all
it
did
much
matter
what
you
loved
so
long
as
you
loved
immensely
it
was
perhaps
thought
approaching
this
subject
with
some
caution
and
diffidence
the
quantity
of
one
love
that
mattered
rather
than
the
quality
of
its
object
not
that
mr
twist
was
of
the
very
first
quality
except
to
look
at
but
what
after
all
were
faces
the
coachman
had
been
as
it
were
nothing
else
but
face
so
handsome
was
he
and
so
without
any
other
recommendation
he
could
even
drive
and
her
father
had
very
soon
kicked
him
out
with
the
vigour
and
absence
of
hesitation
peculiar
to
junkers
when
it
comes
to
kicking
and
had
wept
all
over
her
bread
and
butter
at
tea
that
day
and
was
understood
to
say
that
she
knew
at
last
what
it
must
be
like
to
be
a
widow
mr
twist
for
all
that
he
was
looking
out
of
the
taxi
window
with
an
angry
and
worried
face
his
attention
irritably
concentrated
so
it
seemed
on
the
objects
passing
in
the
road
very
well
knew
he
was
being
observed
he
would
however
allow
his
eye
to
be
caught
he
going
to
become
entangled
at
this
juncture
in
argument
with
the
annas
he
was
hastily
making
up
his
mind
and
there
was
much
time
to
do
it
in
he
had
had
no
explanation
with
the
twins
since
the
manager
visit
to
his
room
and
he
did
want
to
have
any
he
had
issued
brief
orders
to
them
told
them
to
pack
declined
to
answer
questions
and
had
got
them
safely
into
the
taxi
with
a
minimum
waste
of
time
and
words
they
were
now
on
their
way
to
the
station
to
meet
bilton
her
train
from
los
angeles
was
not
due
till
that
evening
at
six
never
mind
the
station
was
a
secure
place
to
deposit
the
twins
and
the
baggage
in
till
she
came
he
wished
he
could
deposit
the
twins
in
the
as
easily
as
he
could
their
grips
neatly
labelled
put
away
safely
on
a
shelf
till
called
for
rapidly
as
he
stared
out
of
the
window
he
arrived
at
decisions
he
would
leave
the
twins
in
the
waiting
room
at
the
station
till
bilton
was
due
and
meanwhile
go
out
and
find
lodgings
for
them
and
her
he
himself
would
get
a
room
in
another
and
less
critical
hotel
and
stay
in
it
till
the
cottage
was
habitable
so
would
unassailable
respectability
once
more
descend
like
a
white
garment
upon
the
party
and
cover
it
up
but
he
was
nettled
nettled
nettled
by
the
that
had
occurred
on
the
very
last
day
when
bilton
was
so
nearly
there
nettled
and
exasperated
so
immensely
did
he
want
the
twins
to
be
happy
to
float
serenely
in
the
unclouded
sunshine
and
sweetness
he
felt
was
their
due
that
he
was
furious
with
them
for
doing
anything
to
make
it
difficult
and
jerkily
his
angry
thoughts
pounced
as
they
so
often
did
on
uncle
arthur
fancy
kicking
two
little
things
like
that
out
into
the
world
two
little
breakable
things
like
that
made
to
be
cherished
and
watched
over
mr
twist
was
pure
american
in
his
instinct
to
regard
the
female
as
an
object
to
be
taken
care
of
to
be
placed
securely
in
a
charming
setting
and
kept
brightly
free
from
dust
if
uncle
arthur
had
had
a
shred
of
humanity
in
him
he
angrily
reflected
the
annas
would
have
stayed
under
his
roof
throughout
the
war
whatever
the
feeling
was
against
aliens
never
would
a
decent
man
have
chucked
them
out
he
turned
involuntarily
from
the
window
and
looked
at
the
twins
their
eyes
were
fixed
affectionate
and
anxious
on
his
face
with
the
quick
change
of
mood
of
those
whose
chins
are
weak
and
whose
hearts
are
warm
a
flood
of
love
for
them
gushed
up
within
him
and
put
out
his
anger
after
all
if
uncle
arthur
had
been
decent
he
edward
a
twist
never
would
have
met
these
blessed
children
he
would
now
have
been
at
clark
leading
lightless
days
hopelessly
involved
with
his
mother
his
loose
unsteady
mouth
broke
into
a
big
smile
instantly
the
two
faces
opposite
cleared
into
something
shining
oh
dear
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
it
refreshing
when
you
leave
off
being
cross
we
fearfully
sorry
if
we
said
anything
we
ought
to
have
said
and
if
you
tell
us
what
it
is
we
wo
say
it
again
i
ca
tell
you
because
i
do
know
what
it
was
said
mr
twist
in
his
usual
kind
voice
i
only
see
the
results
and
the
results
are
that
the
cosmopolitan
is
tired
of
us
and
we
got
to
find
lodgings
lodgings
till
we
can
move
into
the
cottage
i
going
to
put
you
and
bilton
in
an
apartment
in
acapulco
and
go
myself
to
some
hotel
the
twins
stared
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
then
said
with
sudden
passion
you
not
how
that
asked
mr
twist
but
she
was
prevented
answering
by
the
arrival
of
the
taxi
at
the
station
there
followed
ten
minutes
tangle
and
confusion
at
the
end
of
which
the
twins
found
themselves
free
of
their
grips
and
being
piloted
into
the
by
mr
twist
there
he
said
you
sit
here
quiet
and
good
i
come
back
about
one
with
sandwiches
and
candy
for
your
dinner
and
maybe
a
or
two
you
must
leave
this
do
you
hear
i
going
to
hunt
for
those
lodgings
and
he
was
in
the
act
of
taking
off
his
hat
valedictorily
when
again
said
with
the
same
passion
you
not
not
what
inquired
mr
twist
pausing
with
his
hat
in
going
to
hunt
for
lodgings
we
wo
go
to
them
of
course
we
wo
said
with
no
passion
but
with
an
infinitely
determination
and
pray
began
mr
twist
go
into
lodgings
alone
with
mrs
bilton
interrupted
her
face
scarlet
her
whole
small
body
giving
the
impression
of
indignant
feathers
standing
up
on
end
while
you
somewhere
else
away
from
us
we
wo
of
course
we
wo
said
again
an
almost
placid
quality
in
her
determination
it
was
so
final
and
so
unshakable
would
you
see
here
began
mr
twist
we
wo
see
anywhere
said
would
you
inquired
again
reasoning
with
him
like
being
alone
in
lodgings
with
mrs
bilton
this
is
no
time
for
conversation
said
mr
twist
making
for
the
door
you
got
to
do
what
i
think
best
on
this
occasion
and
that
all
about
it
we
wo
repeated
on
the
verge
of
those
tears
which
always
with
her
so
quickly
followed
any
sort
of
emotion
mr
twist
paused
on
his
way
to
the
door
well
now
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
lodgings
he
asked
angrily
it
is
the
devil
it
bilton
said
would
you
yourself
like
you
got
to
have
bilton
with
you
anyhow
from
on
but
not
unadulterated
bilton
you
were
to
have
been
with
us
too
we
ca
be
drowned
all
by
ourselves
in
bilton
would
like
it
of
course
i
would
but
it
only
for
a
few
days
anyhow
said
mr
twist
who
had
been
quite
unprepared
for
opposition
to
his
very
sensible
arrangement
i
should
wonder
if
it
only
a
few
days
now
before
we
can
all
squeeze
into
some
part
of
the
cottage
if
you
do
mind
dust
and
noise
and
workmen
about
all
day
long
a
light
pierced
the
gloom
that
had
gathered
round
soul
we
go
into
it
she
said
firmly
why
not
we
can
camp
out
we
can
live
in
those
little
rooms
at
the
back
over
the
kitchen
the
ones
you
got
ready
for
li
koo
we
be
on
the
spot
we
would
mind
anything
it
would
just
be
a
picnic
and
we
we
would
be
sep
separated
said
getting
it
out
with
a
gasp
mr
twist
stood
looking
at
them
well
of
all
the
he
began
pushing
his
hat
back
are
you
aware
he
went
on
more
calmly
that
there
are
only
two
rooms
over
that
kitchen
and
that
you
and
bilton
will
have
to
be
all
together
in
one
of
them
we
do
mind
that
as
long
as
you
in
the
other
one
said
of
course
suggested
if
you
were
to
happen
to
marry
bilton
it
would
make
a
fairer
division
mr
twist
spectacles
stared
enormously
at
her
no
no
said
quickly
marriage
is
a
sacred
thing
and
you
ca
just
marry
so
as
to
be
more
comfortable
i
guess
if
i
married
bilton
i
be
more
uncomfortable
remarked
mr
twist
with
considerable
dryness
he
seemed
however
to
be
quieted
by
the
bare
suggestion
for
he
fixed
his
hat
properly
on
his
head
and
said
sobriety
in
his
voice
and
manner
come
along
then
we
get
a
taxi
and
anyway
go
out
and
have
a
look
at
the
rooms
but
i
should
be
surprised
he
added
if
before
i
done
with
you
you
have
driven
me
sheer
out
of
my
wits
oh
say
that
said
the
twins
together
with
all
and
more
of
their
usual
urbanity
chapter
xxvi
by
superhuman
exertions
and
a
lavish
expenditure
of
money
the
rooms
li
koo
was
later
on
to
inhabit
were
ready
to
be
slept
in
by
the
time
bilton
arrived
they
were
in
an
outbuilding
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
consisted
of
a
with
a
in
it
a
bedroom
behind
it
and
up
a
narrow
and
curly
staircase
a
larger
room
running
the
whole
length
and
width
of
the
shanty
this
sounds
spacious
but
it
was
the
amount
of
length
and
width
was
small
and
it
was
only
just
possible
to
get
three
into
it
and
a
washstand
the
beds
nearly
touched
each
other
thought
she
and
were
going
to
be
regrettably
close
to
bilton
in
them
and
again
urged
on
mr
twist
consideration
the
question
of
removing
bilton
from
the
room
by
marriage
but
said
it
was
all
perfect
and
that
there
was
lots
of
room
and
she
was
sure
bilton
used
to
the
camp
life
so
extensively
practised
in
america
would
thoroughly
enjoy
herself
they
worked
without
stopping
all
the
rest
of
the
day
at
making
the
little
place
habitable
nailing
up
some
of
the
curtains
intended
for
the
other
house
unpacking
cushions
and
fetching
in
great
bunches
of
the
pale
pink
and
mauve
geraniums
that
scrambled
about
everywhere
in
the
garden
and
hiding
the
worst
places
in
the
rooms
with
them
mr
twist
was
in
acapulco
most
of
the
time
getting
together
the
necessary
temporary
furniture
and
cooking
utensils
but
the
twins
did
miss
him
for
they
were
helped
with
zeal
by
the
architect
the
electrical
expert
the
garden
expert
and
the
chief
plumber
these
young
men
they
were
all
young
and
very
abandoned
the
main
building
that
day
to
the
undirected
labours
of
the
workmen
they
were
supposed
to
control
and
turned
to
on
the
shanty
as
soon
as
they
realized
what
it
was
to
be
used
for
with
a
joyous
energy
that
delighted
the
twins
they
swept
and
they
garnished
they
cleaned
the
dust
off
the
windows
and
the
rust
off
the
stove
they
fetched
out
the
parcels
with
the
curtains
and
cushions
in
them
from
the
barn
where
all
parcels
and
packages
had
been
put
till
the
house
was
ready
and
extracted
various
other
comforts
from
the
piled
up
a
rug
or
two
an
easy
chair
for
bilton
a
they
screwed
in
hooks
behind
the
doors
for
clothes
to
be
hung
on
and
they
tied
the
canary
to
a
neighbouring
eucalyptus
tree
where
it
could
be
seen
and
hardly
heard
the
chief
plumber
found
buckets
and
filled
them
with
water
and
the
electrical
expert
rigged
up
a
series
of
lanterns
inside
the
shanty
even
illuminating
its
tortuous
staircase
there
was
much
but
as
it
was
all
in
american
a
language
of
which
the
twins
were
not
yet
able
to
apprehend
the
full
flavour
they
responded
only
with
pleasant
smiles
but
their
smiles
were
so
pleasant
and
the
family
dimple
so
engaging
that
the
hours
flew
and
the
young
men
were
sorry
indeed
when
mr
twist
came
back
he
came
back
laden
among
other
things
with
food
for
the
twins
whom
he
had
left
in
his
hurry
high
and
dry
at
the
cottage
with
nothing
at
all
to
eat
and
he
found
them
looking
particularly
comfortable
and
having
eaten
as
they
explained
when
they
refused
his
sandwiches
and
fruit
the
chief
plumber
dinner
they
were
sitting
on
the
stump
of
an
oak
tree
when
he
arrived
resting
from
their
labours
and
the
grass
at
their
feet
was
dotted
with
the
four
experts
it
was
the
twins
now
who
were
talking
and
the
experts
who
were
smiling
mr
twist
wondered
uneasily
what
they
were
saying
it
have
added
to
his
comfort
if
he
had
heard
for
they
were
giving
the
experts
an
account
of
their
attempt
to
go
and
live
with
the
sacks
and
interweaving
with
it
some
general
reflections
of
a
philosophical
nature
suggested
by
the
sack
the
experts
were
keenly
interested
and
everybody
looked
very
happy
and
mr
twist
was
annoyed
for
clearly
if
the
experts
were
sitting
there
on
the
grass
they
were
directing
the
workmen
placed
under
their
orders
mr
twist
perceived
a
drawback
to
the
twins
living
on
the
spot
while
the
place
was
being
finished
another
drawback
he
had
perceived
several
already
but
not
this
one
well
bilton
would
soon
be
there
he
now
counted
the
hours
to
bilton
he
positively
longed
for
her
when
they
saw
him
coming
the
experts
moved
away
here
the
boss
they
said
nodding
and
winking
at
the
twins
as
they
got
up
quickly
and
departed
winking
was
not
within
the
traditions
of
the
twinkler
family
but
no
doubt
they
thought
it
was
the
custom
of
the
country
to
wink
and
they
wondered
whether
they
ought
to
have
winked
back
the
young
men
were
certainly
deserving
of
every
friendliness
in
return
for
all
they
had
done
they
decided
they
would
ask
bilton
and
then
they
could
wink
at
them
if
necessary
the
first
thing
morning
mr
twist
took
them
with
him
when
he
went
down
to
the
station
to
meet
the
los
angeles
train
it
was
dark
at
six
and
the
workmen
had
gone
home
by
then
but
the
experts
still
seemed
to
be
busy
he
had
been
astonished
at
the
amount
the
twins
had
accomplished
in
his
absence
in
the
town
till
they
explained
to
him
how
very
active
the
experts
had
been
whereupon
he
said
now
is
that
nice
and
briefly
informed
them
they
would
go
with
him
to
the
station
that
waste
of
time
said
we
could
be
giving
finishing
touches
if
we
stayed
here
you
will
come
with
me
to
the
station
said
mr
twist
bilton
arrived
in
a
thick
cloud
of
conversation
she
supposed
she
was
going
to
the
cosmopolitan
hotel
as
indeed
she
originally
was
and
all
the
way
back
in
the
taxi
mr
twist
was
trying
to
tell
her
she
was
but
bilton
had
so
much
to
say
about
her
journey
and
her
last
days
among
her
friends
and
all
the
pleasant
new
acquaintances
she
had
made
on
the
train
and
her
speech
was
so
very
that
he
felt
he
was
like
a
rabbit
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
hedge
running
desperately
up
and
down
searching
for
a
gap
to
get
through
it
was
nothing
short
of
amazing
how
bilton
talked
positively
there
was
at
any
moment
the
smallest
pause
in
the
flow
it
a
disease
thought
who
had
several
things
she
wanted
to
say
herself
and
found
herself
hopelessly
muzzled
no
wonder
bilton
preferred
heaven
thought
also
a
little
restless
at
the
completeness
of
her
muzzling
anyhow
she
never
hear
the
annas
saying
anything
thought
mr
twist
consoling
himself
this
hotel
we
going
to
seems
to
be
located
at
some
distance
from
the
station
said
bilton
presently
in
the
middle
of
several
pages
of
rapid
unpunctuated
monologue
isolated
surely
and
off
she
went
again
to
other
matters
just
as
mr
twist
had
got
his
mouth
open
to
explain
at
last
she
arrived
therefore
at
the
cottage
unconscious
of
the
change
in
her
fate
now
bilton
was
as
fond
of
comfort
as
any
other
woman
who
has
been
deprived
for
some
years
of
that
substitute
for
comfort
a
husband
she
had
looked
forward
to
the
enveloping
joys
of
the
cosmopolitan
its
bath
its
soft
bed
and
good
food
with
frank
satisfaction
she
thought
it
admirable
that
before
embarking
on
active
duties
she
should
for
a
space
rest
luxuriously
in
an
excellent
hotel
with
no
care
in
regard
to
expense
and
exchange
ideas
while
she
rested
with
the
interesting
people
she
would
be
sure
to
meet
in
it
before
the
interview
in
los
angeles
mr
twist
had
explained
to
her
by
letter
and
under
the
seal
of
confidence
the
philanthropic
nature
of
the
project
he
and
the
miss
twinklers
were
engaged
upon
and
she
was
prepared
in
return
for
the
very
considerable
salary
she
had
accepted
to
do
her
duty
loyally
and
unremittingly
but
after
the
stress
and
hard
work
of
her
last
days
in
los
angeles
she
had
certainly
looked
forward
with
a
particular
pleasure
to
two
or
three
weeks
delicious
wallowing
in
for
which
she
had
not
to
pay
she
was
also
however
a
lady
of
grit
and
she
possessed
as
she
said
her
friends
often
told
her
a
redoubtable
psyche
a
genuine
american
free
and
fearless
psyche
so
that
when
talking
ceaselessly
her
thoughts
eagerly
jostling
each
other
as
they
streamed
through
her
brain
to
get
first
to
the
exit
of
her
tongue
she
caught
her
foot
in
some
builder
débris
carelessly
left
on
the
path
up
to
the
cottage
and
received
in
this
way
positively
her
first
intimation
that
this
could
be
the
cosmopolitan
she
did
not
as
a
more
timid
female
soul
well
might
have
become
alarmed
and
suppose
that
mr
twist
whom
after
all
she
did
know
had
brought
her
to
this
solitary
place
for
purposes
of
assassination
but
stopped
firmly
just
where
she
was
and
turning
her
head
in
the
darkness
toward
him
said
now
mr
twist
stand
right
here
till
you
able
to
apply
some
sort
of
illumination
to
what
at
my
feet
i
ca
say
what
it
is
i
walked
against
but
not
going
any
further
with
this
promenade
till
i
can
say
and
when
you
thrown
light
on
the
subject
perhaps
you
oblige
me
with
information
as
to
where
that
hotel
is
i
was
told
i
was
coming
to
information
cried
mr
twist
have
i
been
trying
to
give
it
you
ever
since
i
met
you
have
i
been
trying
to
stop
your
getting
out
of
the
taxi
till
i
fetched
a
lantern
have
i
been
trying
to
offer
you
my
arm
along
the
path
then
why
did
you
say
so
mr
twist
asked
bilton
say
so
cried
mr
twist
at
that
moment
the
flash
of
an
electric
torch
was
seen
jerking
up
and
down
as
the
person
carrying
it
ran
toward
them
it
was
the
electrical
expert
who
most
fortunately
happened
still
to
be
about
bilton
welcomed
him
warmly
and
taking
his
torch
from
him
first
examined
what
she
called
the
location
of
her
feet
then
gave
it
back
to
him
and
put
her
hand
through
his
arm
now
guide
me
to
whatever
it
is
has
been
substituted
without
my
knowledge
for
that
hotel
she
said
and
while
mr
twist
went
back
to
the
taxi
to
deal
with
her
grips
she
walked
carefully
toward
the
shanty
on
the
expert
arm
expressing
in
an
immense
number
of
words
the
astonishment
she
felt
at
mr
twist
not
having
told
her
of
the
disappearance
of
the
cosmopolitan
from
her
itinerary
the
electrical
expert
tried
to
speak
but
was
drowned
without
further
struggle
unable
to
listen
any
longer
without
answering
to
the
insistent
inquiries
as
to
why
mr
twist
had
kept
her
in
the
dark
raised
her
voice
at
last
and
called
out
but
he
wanted
to
he
wanted
to
all
the
time
you
would
listen
you
would
stop
bilton
did
stop
however
when
she
got
inside
the
shanty
her
tongue
and
her
feet
stopped
dead
together
the
electrical
expert
had
lit
all
the
lanterns
and
coming
upon
it
in
the
darkness
its
lighted
windows
gave
it
a
cheerful
welcoming
look
but
inside
no
amount
of
light
and
bunches
of
pink
geraniums
could
conceal
its
discomforts
its
dreadful
smallness
besides
pink
geraniums
which
the
twins
were
accustomed
to
regard
as
precious
as
things
brought
up
lovingly
in
pots
were
nothing
but
weeds
to
bilton
experienced
californian
eye
she
stared
round
her
in
silence
her
sudden
quiet
fell
on
the
twins
with
a
great
sense
of
refreshment
standing
in
the
doorway
for
bilton
and
the
electrical
expert
between
them
filled
up
most
of
the
kitchen
they
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
see
how
beautiful
the
stars
are
whispered
in
ear
she
had
been
able
to
see
them
before
somehow
bilton
voice
had
so
much
ruffled
the
night
do
you
think
she
talks
in
her
sleep
anxiously
whispered
back
but
mr
twist
arriving
with
his
hands
full
was
staggered
to
find
bilton
not
talking
an
icy
fear
seized
his
heart
she
was
going
to
refuse
to
stay
with
them
and
she
would
be
within
her
rights
if
she
did
for
certainly
what
she
called
her
itinerary
had
promised
her
a
hotel
in
which
she
was
to
continue
till
a
finished
and
comfortable
house
was
stepped
into
i
wish
you
say
something
he
said
plumping
down
the
bags
he
was
carrying
on
the
kitchen
floor
the
twins
from
the
doorway
looked
at
him
and
then
at
each
other
in
great
surprise
fancy
bilton
to
say
something
they
would
come
said
mr
twist
resentfully
jerking
his
head
toward
the
annas
in
the
doorway
it
worse
upstairs
he
went
on
desperately
as
bilton
still
was
dumb
worse
upstairs
cried
the
twins
as
one
woman
it
perfect
upstairs
said
it
like
camping
out
without
out
said
the
only
drawback
is
that
there
are
rather
a
lot
of
beds
in
our
room
said
but
that
of
course
she
turned
to
mr
twist
might
easily
be
arranged
i
wish
you
something
bilton
he
interrupted
quickly
and
loud
bilton
drew
a
deep
breath
and
looked
round
her
she
looked
round
the
room
and
she
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
which
the
upright
feather
in
her
hat
was
tickling
and
she
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
twins
lit
flickeringly
by
the
uncertain
light
of
the
lanterns
then
woman
of
grit
wife
who
had
never
failed
him
of
bruce
bilton
widow
who
had
remained
poised
and
indomitable
on
a
small
income
in
a
circle
of
friends
she
spoke
and
she
said
mr
twist
i
ca
say
what
this
means
and
you
furnish
me
no
doubt
with
information
but
whatever
it
is
i
not
the
woman
to
put
my
hand
to
a
plough
and
then
turn
back
again
that
type
of
behaviour
may
have
been
good
enough
for
pharisees
and
sadducees
who
if
i
remember
rightly
had
to
be
specially
warned
against
the
practice
but
it
is
good
enough
for
me
you
conducted
me
to
a
shack
instead
of
the
hotel
i
was
promised
and
i
await
your
explanation
meanwhile
is
there
any
supper
chapter
xxvii
it
was
only
a
fortnight
after
this
that
the
inn
was
ready
to
be
opened
and
it
was
only
during
the
first
days
of
this
fortnight
that
the
party
in
the
shanty
had
to
endure
any
serious
discomfort
the
twins
mind
the
physical
discomfort
at
all
what
they
minded
and
began
to
mind
almost
immediately
was
the
spiritual
discomfort
of
being
at
such
close
quarters
with
bilton
they
hardly
noticed
the
physical
side
of
that
close
association
in
such
a
lovely
climate
where
the
whole
of
can
be
used
as
one
and
their
morning
dressing
a
difficult
business
in
the
shanty
for
anybody
less
young
and
more
needing
to
be
careful
was
rather
like
the
getting
up
of
a
dog
after
its
night
sleep
they
seemed
just
to
shake
themselves
and
there
they
were
they
got
up
before
bilton
who
was
however
always
awake
and
talking
to
them
while
they
dressed
and
they
went
to
bed
before
she
did
though
she
came
up
with
them
after
the
first
night
and
read
aloud
to
them
while
they
undressed
so
that
as
regarded
the
mysteries
of
bilton
toilette
they
were
not
after
all
much
in
her
way
it
was
like
caravaning
or
camping
out
you
managed
your
movements
and
moments
skilfully
and
if
you
were
bilton
you
had
a
curtain
slung
across
your
part
of
the
room
in
case
your
younger
charges
should
always
be
asleep
when
they
looked
as
if
they
were
gradually
one
alleviation
was
added
to
another
and
bilton
forgot
the
rigours
of
the
beginning
li
koo
arrived
for
instance
fetched
by
a
telegram
and
under
a
tent
in
the
eucalyptus
grove
at
the
back
of
the
house
set
up
an
old
iron
stove
and
produced
with
no
apparent
exertion
extraordinarily
interesting
and
amusing
food
he
went
into
acapulco
at
daylight
every
morning
and
did
the
marketing
he
began
almost
immediately
to
do
everything
else
in
the
way
of
housekeeping
he
was
exquisitely
clean
and
saw
to
it
that
the
shanty
matched
him
in
cleanliness
to
the
surprise
and
gratification
of
the
twins
who
had
supposed
it
would
be
their
lot
to
go
on
doing
the
housework
of
the
shanty
he
took
it
over
as
a
matter
of
course
dusting
sweeping
and
tidying
like
a
practised
and
very
excellent
housemaid
the
only
thing
he
refused
to
do
was
to
touch
the
three
beds
in
the
upper
chamber
me
no
make
he
said
briefly
li
koo
salary
was
enormous
but
mr
twist
with
a
sound
instinct
cared
nothing
what
he
paid
so
long
as
he
got
the
right
man
he
was
indeed
much
satisfied
with
his
two
employees
and
congratulated
himself
on
his
luck
it
is
true
in
regard
to
bilton
his
satisfaction
was
rather
of
the
sorrowful
sort
that
a
fresh
ache
in
a
different
part
of
one
body
from
the
first
ache
gives
it
relieved
him
from
one
by
substituting
another
bilton
overwhelmed
him
but
so
had
the
annas
begun
to
her
overwhelming
however
was
different
and
freed
him
from
that
other
worse
one
he
felt
safe
now
about
the
annas
and
after
all
there
were
parts
of
the
building
in
which
bilton
was
there
was
his
bedroom
for
instance
thank
god
for
bedrooms
thought
mr
twist
he
grew
to
love
his
what
a
haven
that
poky
and
silent
place
was
what
a
blessing
the
conventions
were
and
the
proprieties
supposing
civilization
were
so
far
advanced
that
people
could
no
longer
see
the
harm
there
is
in
a
bedroom
what
would
have
become
of
him
mr
twist
could
perfectly
account
for
bruce
bilton
death
it
was
diabetes
as
bilton
said
it
was
just
bedroom
still
bilton
was
an
undoubted
find
and
did
immediately
in
those
rushed
days
take
the
annas
off
his
mind
he
could
leave
them
with
her
in
the
comfortable
certitude
that
whatever
else
they
did
to
bilton
they
could
talk
to
her
never
would
she
know
the
peculiar
ease
of
the
twinkler
attitude
toward
subjects
americans
approach
with
care
never
would
they
be
able
to
tell
her
things
about
uncle
arthur
the
kind
of
things
that
had
caused
the
cosmopolitan
to
grow
so
suddenly
cool
there
was
most
happily
for
this
particular
case
no
arguing
with
bilton
the
twins
could
draw
her
out
because
she
was
already
as
it
were
so
completely
out
this
was
a
great
thing
mr
twist
felt
and
made
up
for
any
personal
suffocation
he
had
to
bear
and
when
on
the
afternoon
of
bilton
first
day
the
twins
appeared
without
her
in
the
main
building
in
search
of
him
having
obviously
given
her
the
slip
and
said
they
were
sorry
to
disturb
him
but
they
wanted
his
advice
for
though
they
had
been
trying
hard
all
day
remembering
they
were
ladies
and
practically
hostesses
they
had
yet
succeeded
in
saying
anything
at
all
to
bilton
and
doubted
whether
they
ever
would
he
merely
smiled
happily
at
them
and
said
to
see
how
good
comes
out
of
evil
a
remark
that
they
did
like
when
they
had
had
time
to
think
over
it
but
they
went
on
struggling
it
seemed
so
unnatural
to
be
all
alone
all
day
long
with
someone
and
only
listen
bilton
never
left
their
side
regarding
it
as
proper
and
merely
fulfilling
her
part
of
the
bargain
in
these
first
confused
days
when
there
was
nothing
for
ladies
to
do
but
look
on
while
perspiring
workmen
laboured
at
apparently
producing
more
and
more
chaos
to
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
her
young
charges
this
she
did
by
imparting
to
them
intimate
and
meticulous
information
about
her
own
life
with
the
whole
of
the
various
uplifts
as
she
put
it
her
psyche
had
during
its
unfolding
experienced
there
was
so
much
to
tell
about
herself
that
she
never
got
to
inquiring
about
the
twins
she
knew
they
were
orphans
and
that
this
was
a
good
work
and
for
the
moment
had
no
time
for
more
the
twins
were
profoundly
bored
by
her
psyche
chiefly
because
they
did
know
what
part
of
her
it
was
and
it
was
no
use
asking
for
she
did
answer
but
they
listened
with
real
interest
to
her
concrete
experiences
and
especially
to
the
experiences
connected
with
bilton
they
particularly
wished
to
ask
questions
about
bilton
and
find
out
what
he
had
thought
of
things
bilton
was
lavish
in
her
details
of
what
she
had
thought
herself
but
bilton
thoughts
remained
impenetrable
it
seemed
to
the
twins
that
he
must
have
thought
a
lot
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
death
the
biltons
it
appeared
had
been
the
opposite
of
the
and
had
never
been
separated
for
a
single
day
during
the
whole
of
their
married
life
this
seemed
to
the
twins
very
strange
and
needing
a
great
deal
of
explanation
in
order
to
get
light
thrown
on
it
the
first
thing
they
wanted
to
find
out
was
how
long
the
marriage
had
lasted
but
bilton
was
deaf
to
their
inquiries
and
having
described
last
moments
and
obsequies
obsequies
scheduled
by
her
she
said
with
so
tender
a
regard
for
his
memory
that
she
insisted
on
a
hearse
instead
of
the
more
fashionable
automobile
conveyance
on
the
ground
that
a
motor
hearse
did
seem
sorry
enough
even
on
first
speed
she
washed
along
with
an
easy
flow
to
descriptions
of
the
dreadfulness
of
the
early
days
of
widowhood
when
one
crepe
veil
keeps
on
catching
in
everything
chairs
overhanging
branches
and
including
it
appeared
on
one
occasion
a
policeman
she
inquired
of
the
twins
whether
they
had
ever
seen
a
widow
in
a
wind
chicago
she
said
was
a
windy
place
and
bilton
passed
in
its
windiest
month
her
long
veil
as
she
proceeded
down
the
streets
on
the
daily
constitutional
she
considered
it
her
duty
toward
the
living
to
take
for
one
owes
it
to
one
friends
to
keep
oneself
fit
and
not
give
way
was
blown
hither
and
thither
in
the
buffeting
of
that
uneasy
climate
and
her
walk
in
the
busier
streets
was
a
series
of
entanglements
embarrassing
entanglements
said
bilton
fortunately
the
persons
she
got
caught
in
were
delicacy
and
sympathy
itself
often
indeed
seeming
quite
overcome
by
the
peculiar
poignancy
of
the
situation
covered
with
confusion
profuse
in
apologies
sometimes
the
wind
would
cause
her
veil
for
a
few
moments
to
rear
straight
up
above
her
head
in
a
monstrous
black
column
of
woe
sometimes
if
she
stopped
a
moment
waiting
to
cross
the
street
it
would
whip
round
the
body
of
any
one
who
happened
to
be
near
like
a
cord
it
did
this
once
about
the
body
of
the
policeman
directing
the
traffic
by
whose
side
she
had
paused
and
she
had
to
walk
round
him
backwards
before
it
could
be
unwound
the
chicago
evening
papers
prompt
on
the
track
of
a
sensation
had
caused
her
friends
much
painful
if
only
amazement
by
coming
out
with
huge
equivocal
headlines
society
widow
and
policeman
caught
together
and
beginning
their
description
of
the
occurrence
by
printing
her
name
in
full
so
that
for
the
first
sentence
or
two
her
friends
were
a
prey
to
horror
and
distress
which
turned
to
indignation
on
discovering
there
was
nothing
in
it
after
all
the
twins
their
eyes
on
bilton
face
their
hands
clasped
round
their
knees
their
bodies
sitting
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
occasionally
felt
as
they
followed
her
narrative
that
they
were
somehow
out
of
their
depth
and
did
quite
understand
it
was
extraordinarily
exasperating
to
them
to
be
so
completely
muzzled
they
were
accustomed
to
elucidate
points
they
did
understand
by
immediate
inquiry
they
had
a
habit
of
asking
for
information
and
then
delivering
comments
on
it
this
condition
of
repression
made
them
most
uncomfortable
the
ilex
tree
in
the
field
below
the
house
to
which
bilton
shepherded
them
each
morning
and
afternoon
for
the
first
three
days
became
to
them
in
spite
of
its
beauty
with
the
view
from
under
its
dark
shade
across
the
sunny
fields
to
the
sea
and
the
delicate
distant
islands
a
painful
spot
the
beauty
all
round
them
was
under
these
conditions
exasperating
only
once
did
bilton
leave
them
and
that
was
the
first
afternoon
when
they
instantly
fled
to
seek
out
mr
twist
and
she
only
left
them
then
for
it
was
just
her
sense
of
duty
that
was
strong
but
also
her
dislike
of
being
alone
because
something
unexpectedly
gave
way
in
the
upper
part
of
her
dress
she
being
of
a
tight
figure
depending
much
on
its
buttons
and
she
had
very
hastily
to
go
in
search
of
a
needle
after
that
they
did
see
mr
twist
alone
for
several
days
they
hardly
indeed
saw
him
at
all
the
only
meal
he
shared
with
them
was
supper
and
on
finding
the
first
evening
that
bilton
read
aloud
to
people
after
supper
he
made
the
excuse
of
accounts
to
go
through
and
went
into
his
bedroom
repeating
this
each
night
the
twins
watched
him
go
with
agonized
eyes
they
considered
themselves
deserted
shamefully
abandoned
to
a
miserable
fate
and
it
is
as
if
he
did
reading
aloud
whispered
bewildered
and
indignant
as
she
remembered
the
ode
to
dooty
perhaps
he
one
of
those
people
who
only
like
it
if
they
do
it
themselves
whispered
back
trying
to
explain
his
base
behaviour
and
while
they
whispered
bilton
with
great
enjoyment
declaimed
she
had
had
a
course
of
elocution
lessons
during
life
so
as
to
be
able
to
place
the
best
literature
advantageously
before
him
the
diary
of
a
young
girl
written
in
prison
the
young
girl
had
been
wrongfully
incarcerated
bilton
explained
and
her
pure
soul
only
found
release
by
the
demise
of
her
body
the
twins
hated
the
young
girl
from
the
first
paragraph
she
wrote
her
diary
every
day
till
her
demise
stopped
her
as
nothing
happens
in
prisons
that
has
happened
the
day
before
she
could
only
write
her
reflections
and
the
twins
hated
her
reflections
because
they
were
so
very
like
what
in
their
secret
moments
of
slush
they
were
apt
to
reflect
themselves
their
mother
had
had
a
horror
of
slush
there
had
been
none
anywhere
about
her
but
it
is
in
the
air
in
germany
in
people
blood
everywhere
and
though
the
twins
owing
to
the
english
part
of
them
had
a
horror
of
it
too
there
it
was
in
them
and
they
knew
it
genuine
german
slush
they
felt
uncomfortably
sure
that
if
they
were
in
prison
they
would
write
a
diary
very
much
on
these
lines
for
three
evenings
they
had
to
listen
to
it
their
eyes
on
mr
twist
door
why
did
he
come
out
and
save
them
what
happy
what
glorious
evenings
they
used
to
have
at
the
cosmopolitan
spent
in
intelligent
conversation
in
a
decent
give
and
take
not
this
business
this
being
got
into
a
corner
and
held
down
and
alas
how
little
they
had
appreciated
them
they
used
to
get
sleepy
and
break
them
off
and
go
to
bed
if
only
he
would
come
out
now
and
talk
to
them
they
would
sit
up
all
night
they
wriggled
with
impatience
in
their
seats
beneath
the
of
the
young
girl
the
strangely
and
distressingly
familiar
the
diary
was
published
in
a
magazine
and
after
the
second
evening
when
bilton
on
laying
it
down
announced
she
would
go
on
with
it
while
they
were
dressing
next
morning
they
got
up
very
early
before
bilton
was
awake
and
crept
out
and
hid
it
but
li
koo
found
it
and
restored
it
li
koo
found
everything
he
found
bilton
outdoor
shoes
the
third
morning
although
the
twins
had
hidden
them
most
carefully
their
idea
was
that
while
she
rendered
immobile
waited
indoors
they
would
zealously
look
for
them
in
all
the
places
where
they
well
knew
that
they
were
and
perhaps
get
some
conversation
with
mr
twist
but
li
koo
found
everything
he
found
the
twins
themselves
the
fourth
morning
when
unable
any
longer
to
bear
bilton
voice
they
ran
into
the
woods
instead
of
coming
in
to
breakfast
he
seemed
to
find
them
at
once
to
walk
unswervingly
to
their
remote
and
ditch
in
order
to
save
their
dignity
they
said
as
they
scrambled
out
that
they
were
picking
flowers
for
bilton
breakfast
though
the
ditch
had
nothing
in
it
but
stones
and
thorns
li
koo
made
no
comment
he
never
did
make
comments
and
his
silence
and
his
ubiquitous
efficiency
made
the
twins
as
fidgety
with
him
as
they
were
with
bilton
for
the
opposite
reason
they
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
was
rather
like
the
he
saw
everything
knew
everything
and
said
nothing
in
vain
they
tried
on
that
walk
back
as
at
other
times
to
pierce
his
impassivity
with
genialities
li
koo
again
they
silently
reflected
like
the
had
a
different
sense
of
geniality
from
theirs
he
could
apparently
smile
they
doubted
if
he
even
ever
wanted
to
their
genialities
faltered
and
froze
on
their
lips
besides
they
were
deeply
humiliated
by
having
been
found
hiding
and
were
ashamed
to
find
themselves
trying
anxiously
in
this
manner
to
conciliate
li
koo
their
dignity
on
the
walk
back
to
the
shanty
seemed
painfully
shrunk
they
ought
never
to
have
condescended
to
do
the
childish
things
they
had
been
doing
during
the
last
three
days
if
they
had
been
found
out
it
would
of
course
have
remained
a
private
matter
between
them
and
their
maker
and
then
one
does
mind
so
much
but
they
had
been
found
out
and
by
li
koo
their
own
servant
it
was
intolerable
all
the
blood
of
all
the
twinklers
junkers
from
time
immemorial
and
properly
sensitive
to
humiliation
surged
within
them
they
had
felt
so
naughty
and
so
young
for
years
they
were
sure
li
koo
did
believe
them
about
the
ditch
they
had
a
dreadful
sensation
of
being
led
back
to
bilton
by
the
ear
if
only
they
could
sack
bilton
this
thought
immense
and
startling
came
to
who
far
more
than
resented
being
cut
off
from
mr
twist
besides
being
more
naturally
impetuous
and
as
they
walked
in
silence
side
by
side
with
li
koo
a
little
ahead
of
them
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
let
give
her
notice
she
murmured
under
her
breath
was
so
much
taken
aback
that
she
stopped
in
her
walk
and
stared
at
flushed
face
she
too
hardly
breathed
it
the
suggestion
seemed
fantastic
in
its
monstrousness
how
could
they
give
anybody
so
old
so
sure
of
herself
so
determined
as
bilton
notice
give
her
notice
she
repeated
a
chill
ran
down
spine
give
bilton
notice
it
was
a
great
a
idea
magnificent
in
its
assertion
of
independence
of
rights
but
it
needed
she
felt
to
be
approached
with
caution
they
had
never
given
anybody
notice
in
their
lives
and
they
had
always
thought
it
must
be
a
most
painful
thing
to
do
far
far
worse
than
tipping
uncle
arthur
used
to
mind
it
a
bit
did
it
indeed
with
gusto
but
aunt
alice
had
liked
it
at
all
and
came
out
in
a
cold
perspiration
and
bewailed
her
lot
to
them
and
wished
that
people
would
behave
and
not
place
her
in
such
a
painful
position
bilton
could
be
said
not
to
have
behaved
quite
the
contrary
she
had
behaved
too
persistently
and
they
had
to
endure
it
the
whole
hours
for
bilton
had
no
turn
it
appeared
in
spite
of
what
she
had
said
at
los
angeles
for
solitary
contemplation
and
after
the
confusion
of
the
first
night
when
once
she
had
had
time
to
envisage
the
situation
thoroughly
as
she
said
she
had
found
that
to
sit
alone
downstairs
in
the
uncertain
light
of
the
lanterns
while
the
twins
went
to
bed
and
mr
twist
would
come
out
of
his
room
was
not
good
for
her
psyche
so
she
had
followed
the
twins
upstairs
and
continued
to
read
the
young
girl
diary
to
them
during
their
undressing
and
till
the
noises
coming
from
their
beds
convinced
her
that
it
was
useless
to
go
on
any
longer
and
that
morning
the
morning
they
hid
in
the
ditch
she
had
even
done
this
while
they
were
getting
up
it
is
to
be
borne
said
under
her
breath
one
eye
on
li
koo
ear
which
a
little
in
front
of
her
seemed
slightly
slanted
backward
and
sideways
in
the
direction
of
her
voice
and
why
should
it
be
we
not
in
her
power
no
said
also
under
her
breath
and
also
watching
li
koo
ear
but
it
feels
extraordinarily
as
if
we
were
yes
and
that
intolerable
and
it
forces
us
to
do
silly
baby
things
wholly
unsuited
either
to
our
age
or
our
position
who
would
have
thought
we
ever
hide
from
somebody
in
a
ditch
again
voice
was
almost
a
sob
at
the
humiliation
it
all
comes
from
sleeping
in
the
same
room
said
nobody
can
stand
a
thing
that
does
end
at
night
either
of
course
they
ca
said
it
is
fair
if
you
have
to
have
a
person
all
day
you
ought
to
have
to
have
the
same
person
all
night
some
one
else
should
step
in
and
relieve
you
then
just
as
they
do
in
hospitals
yes
said
mr
twist
ought
to
he
ought
to
remove
her
forcibly
from
our
room
by
marriage
no
he
ought
said
hastily
because
we
can
remove
her
ourselves
by
the
simple
process
of
giving
her
notice
i
do
believe
it
simple
said
again
feeling
a
chill
trickling
down
her
spine
of
course
it
is
we
just
go
to
her
very
politely
and
inform
her
that
the
engagement
is
terminated
on
a
basis
of
mutual
esteem
but
inflexible
determination
and
suppose
she
does
stop
talking
enough
to
hear
then
we
hand
it
to
her
in
writing
the
rest
of
the
way
they
walked
in
silence
with
her
chin
thrust
out
in
defiance
dragging
her
feet
along
with
a
certain
reluctance
and
doubt
bilton
had
finished
her
breakfast
when
they
got
back
having
seen
no
sense
in
letting
good
food
get
cold
and
was
ready
to
sit
and
chat
to
them
while
they
had
theirs
she
was
so
busy
telling
them
what
she
had
supposed
they
were
probably
doing
that
she
was
unable
to
listen
to
their
attempted
account
of
what
they
had
done
thus
they
were
saved
from
telling
humiliating
and
youthful
fibs
but
they
were
also
prevented
as
by
a
wall
of
rock
from
getting
the
speech
through
to
her
ear
that
trembling
in
spite
of
her
defiance
had
ready
to
launch
at
her
it
was
impossible
to
shout
at
bilton
in
the
way
mr
twist
when
in
extremity
of
necessity
had
done
ladies
did
shout
especially
not
when
they
were
giving
other
ladies
notice
who
was
quite
cold
and
clammy
at
the
prospect
of
her
speech
help
feeling
relieved
when
breakfast
was
over
and
no
opportunity
for
it
had
been
given
we
write
it
she
whispered
to
beneath
the
cover
of
a
lively
account
bilton
was
giving
them
of
their
being
late
for
breakfast
of
the
time
it
took
her
after
bilton
passing
to
get
used
to
his
unpunctuality
at
meals
that
bilton
who
had
breakfasted
and
dined
with
her
steadily
for
years
should
suddenly
leave
off
being
punctual
freshly
astonished
her
every
day
she
said
the
clock
struck
yet
bilton
continued
late
it
was
poignant
said
bilton
this
way
of
being
reminded
of
her
loss
each
day
she
would
instinctively
expect
each
day
would
come
the
stab
of
recollection
the
vacancy
these
had
made
in
her
life
was
beyond
any
words
of
hers
in
fact
she
did
possess
such
words
and
doubted
if
the
completest
dictionary
did
either
everything
went
just
vacant
she
said
no
need
any
more
to
hurry
down
in
the
morning
so
as
to
be
behind
the
coffee
pot
half
a
minute
before
the
gong
went
and
bilton
simultaneously
appeared
no
need
any
more
to
think
of
him
when
ordering
meals
no
need
any
more
to
eat
the
dish
he
had
been
so
fond
of
and
she
had
found
so
difficult
to
digest
boston
baked
beans
and
bacon
yet
she
found
herself
ordering
it
continually
after
his
departure
and
choking
memorially
over
the
mouthfuls
and
people
in
europe
cried
mrs
bilton
herself
struck
as
she
talked
by
this
extreme
devotion
say
that
american
women
are
incapable
of
passion
we
write
it
whispered
to
write
what
asked
abstractedly
who
as
usual
when
bilton
narrated
her
reminiscences
was
absorbed
in
listening
to
them
and
trying
to
get
some
clear
image
of
bilton
but
she
remembered
the
next
moment
and
it
was
like
waking
up
to
the
recollection
that
this
is
the
day
you
have
to
have
a
tooth
pulled
out
the
idea
of
not
having
the
tooth
any
more
of
being
free
from
it
charmed
and
thrilled
her
but
how
painful
how
alarming
was
the
prospect
of
pulling
it
out
there
was
one
good
thing
to
be
said
for
bilton
talk
and
that
was
that
under
its
voluminous
cover
they
could
themselves
whisper
occasionally
to
each
other
decided
that
if
bilton
notice
that
they
whispered
neither
probably
would
she
notice
if
she
wrote
she
therefore
under
bilton
very
nose
got
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
and
with
many
pauses
and
an
unsteady
hand
wrote
the
following
dear
bilton
for
some
time
past
my
sister
and
i
have
felt
that
we
are
suited
to
you
and
if
you
do
mind
would
you
mind
regarding
the
engagement
as
terminated
we
hope
you
wo
think
this
abrupt
because
it
is
really
for
we
seem
to
have
lived
ages
since
you
came
and
we
been
thinking
this
over
ripely
ever
since
and
we
hope
you
take
it
as
anything
personal
either
because
it
is
really
it
only
that
we
feel
we
unsuitable
and
we
sure
we
go
on
getting
more
and
more
unsuitable
nobody
can
help
being
unsuitable
and
fearfully
sorry
but
on
the
other
hand
we
yours
affectionately
and
twinkler
with
a
beating
heart
she
cautiously
pushed
the
letter
across
the
table
under
cover
of
the
breakfast
to
who
read
it
with
a
beating
heart
and
cautiously
pushed
it
back
felt
sure
christopher
was
being
terribly
impetuous
and
she
felt
sure
she
ought
to
stop
her
but
what
a
joy
to
be
without
bilton
the
thought
of
going
to
bed
in
the
placid
sluggishness
dear
to
her
heart
without
having
to
listen
to
be
attentive
to
remember
to
be
tidy
because
if
she
were
there
would
be
no
room
for
things
was
too
much
for
her
authority
pursuing
her
into
her
bedroom
was
what
she
had
found
most
difficult
to
bear
there
must
be
respite
there
must
be
intervals
in
every
activity
or
endurance
even
the
otherwise
so
indefatigable
had
felt
this
and
arranged
for
the
relaxation
of
sundays
she
pushed
the
letter
back
with
a
beating
heart
and
told
herself
that
she
could
and
never
had
been
able
to
stop
christopher
when
she
was
in
this
mood
of
her
chin
sticking
out
what
could
she
do
in
face
of
such
a
chin
and
besides
bilton
friends
must
be
missing
her
very
much
and
ought
to
have
her
back
one
should
always
live
only
with
one
own
sort
of
people
every
other
way
of
living
was
sure
even
at
this
early
stage
of
her
existence
was
bound
to
come
to
a
bad
end
one
could
be
fond
of
almost
anybody
she
held
if
they
were
somewhere
else
even
of
uncle
arthur
even
he
somehow
seemed
softened
by
distance
but
for
purposes
there
was
only
one
kind
of
people
possible
and
that
was
one
own
kind
unexpected
and
various
were
the
exteriors
of
one
own
kind
and
the
places
one
found
them
in
but
one
always
knew
them
one
felt
comfortable
with
them
at
once
comfortable
and
placid
whatever
else
bilton
might
be
feeling
she
feeling
placid
that
was
evident
and
it
was
because
she
too
was
with
her
own
kind
with
her
eyes
fixed
nervously
on
bilton
who
was
talking
on
happily
reasoned
with
herself
in
the
above
manner
as
she
pushed
back
the
letter
instead
of
as
at
the
back
of
her
mind
she
felt
she
ought
to
have
done
tearing
it
up
folded
it
and
addressed
it
to
bilton
then
she
got
up
and
held
it
out
to
her
got
up
too
her
inside
feeling
strangely
unsteady
and
stirred
round
and
round
would
you
mind
reading
this
said
faintly
to
bilton
who
took
the
letter
mechanically
and
held
it
in
her
hand
without
apparently
noticing
it
so
much
engaged
was
she
by
what
she
was
saying
we
going
out
a
moment
to
speak
to
mr
twist
then
said
making
for
the
door
and
beckoning
to
who
still
stood
hesitating
she
slipped
out
and
suddenly
lest
she
should
be
buttonholed
all
by
herself
fled
after
her
chapter
xxviii
mr
twist
his
mind
at
ease
was
in
the
charming
room
that
was
to
be
the
it
was
full
of
scattered
fittings
and
the
noise
of
hammering
but
even
so
anybody
could
see
what
a
delightful
place
it
would
presently
turn
into
the
open
arms
was
to
make
a
specialty
of
wet
days
those
were
the
days
those
consecutive
days
of
downpour
that
came
in
the
winter
and
lasted
without
interruption
for
a
fortnight
at
a
time
when
visitors
in
the
hotels
were
bored
beyond
expression
and
ready
to
welcome
anything
that
could
distract
them
for
an
hour
from
the
dripping
of
the
rain
on
the
windows
bridge
was
their
one
solace
and
they
played
it
from
after
breakfast
till
bedtime
but
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
day
of
doing
this
just
the
mere
steady
sitting
became
grievous
to
them
they
ached
with
weariness
they
wilted
with
boredom
all
their
natural
kindness
got
damped
out
of
them
and
they
were
cross
even
when
they
won
they
were
cross
and
when
they
lost
it
was
really
distressing
they
would
of
course
have
been
in
california
at
all
at
such
a
time
if
it
were
possible
to
know
beforehand
when
the
rains
would
begin
but
one
never
did
know
and
often
it
was
glorious
weather
right
up
to
and
beyond
christmas
and
then
how
glorious
what
a
golden
place
of
light
and
warmth
to
be
in
while
in
the
east
one
friends
were
being
battered
by
blizzards
mr
twist
intended
to
provide
a
break
in
the
day
each
afternoon
for
these
victims
of
the
rain
he
would
come
to
their
rescue
he
made
up
his
mind
clear
and
firm
on
such
matters
that
it
should
become
the
habit
of
these
unhappy
people
during
the
bad
weather
to
motor
out
to
the
open
arms
for
tea
and
full
of
forethought
he
had
had
a
covered
way
made
by
which
one
could
get
out
of
a
car
and
into
the
house
without
being
touched
by
a
drop
of
rain
and
he
had
had
a
huge
open
fireplace
made
across
the
end
of
the
which
would
crackle
and
blaze
a
welcome
that
would
cheer
the
most
dispirited
arrival
the
cakes
at
all
times
wonderful
were
on
wet
days
to
be
more
than
wonderful
li
koo
had
a
secret
receipt
given
him
he
said
by
his
mother
for
cakes
of
a
quite
peculiar
and
original
charm
and
these
were
to
be
reserved
for
the
rainy
season
only
and
be
made
its
specialty
they
were
to
become
known
and
endeared
to
the
public
under
the
brief
designation
of
wet
day
cakes
mr
twist
felt
there
was
something
thoroughly
american
about
this
name
plain
and
and
attractively
in
contrast
to
the
subtle
the
almost
immoral
exquisiteness
of
the
article
itself
this
cake
had
been
one
of
those
produced
by
li
koo
from
the
folds
of
his
garments
the
day
in
los
angeles
and
mr
twist
had
happened
to
be
the
one
of
his
party
who
ate
it
he
therefore
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
decided
to
call
it
and
its
like
simply
wet
day
cakes
the
twins
found
him
experimenting
with
a
fire
in
the
fireplace
so
as
to
be
sure
it
did
smoke
and
the
architect
and
he
were
in
their
shirt
sleeves
deftly
manipulating
wood
shavings
and
logs
there
was
such
a
hammering
being
made
by
the
workmen
fixing
in
the
latticed
windows
and
such
a
crackling
being
made
by
the
logs
mr
twist
and
the
architect
kept
on
throwing
on
the
fire
that
only
from
the
sudden
broad
smile
on
the
architect
face
as
he
turned
to
pick
up
another
log
did
mr
twist
realize
that
something
that
had
to
do
with
work
was
happening
behind
his
back
he
looked
round
and
saw
the
annas
picking
their
way
toward
him
they
seemed
in
a
hurry
hello
he
called
out
they
made
no
reply
to
this
but
continued
hurriedly
to
pick
their
way
among
the
obstacles
in
their
path
they
appeared
to
be
much
perturbed
what
he
wondered
had
they
done
with
bilton
he
soon
knew
we
given
bilton
notice
panted
as
soon
as
she
got
near
enough
to
his
ear
for
him
to
hear
her
in
the
prevailing
noise
her
face
as
usual
when
she
was
moved
and
excited
was
scarlet
her
eyes
looking
bluer
and
brighter
than
ever
by
contrast
we
simply
ca
stand
it
any
longer
she
went
on
as
mr
twist
only
stared
at
her
and
you
would
either
if
you
were
us
she
continued
the
more
passionately
as
he
still
did
say
anything
of
course
said
taking
a
high
line
though
her
heart
was
full
of
doubt
it
your
fault
really
we
could
have
borne
it
if
we
had
had
to
have
her
at
night
come
outside
said
mr
twist
walking
toward
the
door
that
led
on
to
the
verandah
they
followed
him
shaking
with
excitement
trying
to
persuade
herself
that
they
had
acted
in
the
only
way
consistent
with
real
wisdom
the
architect
stood
with
a
log
in
each
hand
looking
after
them
and
smiling
all
by
himself
there
was
something
about
the
twinklers
that
lightened
his
heart
whenever
he
caught
sight
of
them
he
and
his
fellow
experts
had
deplored
the
absence
of
opportunities
since
bilton
came
of
developing
the
friendship
begun
the
first
day
and
talked
of
them
on
their
way
home
in
the
afternoons
with
affectionate
and
respectful
familiarity
as
the
cutes
now
said
mr
twist
having
passed
through
the
verandah
and
led
the
twins
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
where
he
turned
and
faced
them
perhaps
you
tell
me
exactly
what
you
done
you
should
rather
inquire
what
bilton
has
done
said
pulling
herself
up
as
straight
and
tall
as
she
would
go
she
could
but
perceive
that
the
excess
of
christopher
emotion
was
putting
her
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
matter
of
dignity
i
can
guess
pretty
much
what
she
has
done
said
mr
twist
you
ca
you
ca
burst
out
nobody
could
nobody
ever
could
who
had
been
with
her
day
and
night
she
just
been
bilton
said
mr
twist
lighting
a
cigarette
to
give
himself
an
appearance
of
calm
exactly
said
so
you
wo
be
surprised
at
our
having
just
been
twinklers
oh
lord
groaned
mr
twist
in
spite
of
his
cigarette
oh
lord
we
given
bilton
notice
continued
making
a
gesture
of
great
dignity
with
her
hand
because
we
find
with
regret
that
she
and
we
are
incompatible
was
she
aware
that
you
were
giving
it
her
asked
mr
twist
endeavouring
to
keep
calm
we
wrote
it
has
she
read
it
we
put
it
into
her
hand
and
then
came
away
so
that
she
should
have
an
opportunity
of
quietly
considering
it
you
should
have
left
us
alone
with
her
like
this
burst
out
again
you
should
really
it
was
cruel
it
was
wrong
leaving
us
high
and
dry
never
seeing
you
leaving
us
to
be
talked
to
day
and
night
to
be
read
to
would
like
to
be
read
to
while
you
undressing
by
somebody
still
in
all
their
clothes
we
never
been
able
to
open
our
mouths
we
been
taken
into
the
field
for
our
airing
and
brought
in
again
as
if
we
were
newborns
or
people
in
prams
or
flocks
and
herds
or
prisoners
suspected
of
wanting
to
escape
we
have
had
a
minute
to
ourselves
day
or
night
there
has
been
a
single
exchange
of
ideas
not
a
shred
of
recognition
that
we
grown
up
we
been
followed
watched
talked
to
oh
oh
how
awful
it
has
been
oh
oh
how
awful
forced
to
be
dumb
for
days
losing
our
power
of
speech
twinkler
interrupted
mr
twist
sternly
you
have
lost
it
and
you
not
only
have
but
that
power
of
yours
has
increased
tenfold
during
its
days
of
rest
he
spoke
with
the
exasperation
in
his
voice
that
they
had
already
heard
several
times
since
they
landed
in
america
each
time
it
took
them
aback
for
mr
twist
was
firmly
fixed
in
their
minds
as
the
kindest
and
gentlest
of
creatures
and
these
sudden
kickings
of
his
each
time
astonished
them
on
this
occasion
however
only
was
astonished
all
along
had
had
an
uncomfortable
conviction
in
the
depth
of
her
heart
that
mr
twist
would
like
what
they
had
done
he
would
be
upset
she
felt
as
her
reluctant
feet
followed
in
search
of
him
he
would
be
she
was
afraid
very
much
upset
and
so
he
was
he
was
appalled
by
what
had
happened
lose
bilton
lose
the
very
foundation
of
the
party
respectability
and
how
could
he
find
somebody
else
at
the
eleventh
hour
and
where
and
how
could
the
twins
and
he
live
unchaperoned
as
they
would
be
till
he
had
what
a
peculiar
talent
these
annas
had
for
getting
themselves
and
him
into
impossible
situations
of
course
at
their
age
they
ought
to
be
safe
under
the
wing
of
a
wise
and
unusually
determined
mother
well
poor
little
wretches
they
help
not
being
under
it
but
that
aunt
of
theirs
ought
to
have
stuck
to
them
faced
up
to
her
husband
and
stuck
to
them
i
suppose
he
said
angrily
being
you
and
not
being
able
to
see
farther
than
the
ends
of
your
noses
you
have
got
any
sort
of
an
idea
of
what
you
done
we
she
and
i
do
suppose
it
much
use
my
trying
to
explain
either
it
ever
occurred
to
you
though
i
be
real
grateful
if
you
give
me
information
on
this
point
that
maybe
you
do
know
everything
she
we
and
that
till
you
do
know
everything
which
i
take
it
wo
be
for
some
time
yet
judging
from
the
samples
i
had
of
your
perspicacity
do
well
not
to
act
without
first
asking
some
one
advice
mine
for
instance
she
began
again
but
her
voice
was
trembling
for
she
could
bear
mr
twist
anger
she
was
too
fond
of
him
when
he
looked
at
her
like
that
her
own
anger
was
blown
out
as
if
by
an
icy
draught
and
she
could
only
look
back
at
him
piteously
but
being
free
from
the
weaknesses
inherent
in
adoration
besides
continuing
to
perceive
how
christopher
feelings
put
her
at
a
disadvantage
drew
mr
twist
attention
from
her
by
saying
with
gentleness
but
why
add
to
the
general
discomfort
by
being
bitter
bitter
cried
mr
twist
still
glaring
at
do
you
dispute
that
god
made
us
inquired
placing
herself
as
it
were
like
a
shield
between
mr
twist
wrathful
concentration
on
christopher
and
that
unfortunate
young
emotion
see
here
said
mr
twist
turning
on
her
i
not
going
to
argue
with
you
not
about
least
of
all
about
god
i
only
wanted
to
point
out
to
you
said
mildly
that
that
being
so
and
we
not
able
to
help
it
there
seems
little
use
in
being
bitter
with
us
because
we
not
different
in
regard
to
anything
fundamental
about
us
that
you
deplore
i
afraid
we
must
refer
you
to
providence
say
said
mr
twist
not
in
the
least
appeased
by
this
reasoning
but
as
could
but
notice
quite
the
contrary
used
you
to
talk
like
this
to
that
uncle
arthur
of
yours
because
if
you
did
upon
my
word
i
do
wonder
but
what
mr
twist
did
wonder
was
fortunately
concealed
from
the
twins
by
the
appearance
at
that
moment
of
bilton
who
emerging
from
the
shades
of
the
verandah
and
looking
about
her
caught
sight
of
them
and
came
rapidly
down
the
garden
there
was
no
escape
they
watched
her
bearing
down
on
them
without
a
word
it
was
a
most
unpleasant
moment
mr
twist
his
cigarette
to
give
himself
a
countenance
but
the
thought
of
all
that
bilton
would
probably
say
was
dreadful
to
him
and
his
hand
could
help
shaking
a
little
showed
a
guilty
tendency
to
slink
behind
him
stood
motionless
awaiting
the
deluge
all
mr
twist
sympathies
were
with
bilton
and
he
was
ashamed
that
she
should
have
been
treated
so
he
felt
that
nothing
she
could
say
would
be
severe
enough
and
he
was
extraordinarily
angry
with
the
annas
yet
when
he
saw
the
injured
lady
bearing
down
on
them
if
he
only
could
he
would
have
picked
up
an
anna
under
each
arm
guilty
as
they
were
and
run
and
run
so
much
did
he
prefer
them
to
bilton
and
so
terribly
did
he
want
at
this
moment
to
be
somewhere
where
that
lady
was
there
they
stood
then
anxiously
watching
the
approaching
figure
and
the
letter
in
bilton
hand
bobbed
up
and
down
as
she
walked
white
and
conspicuous
in
the
sun
against
her
black
dress
what
was
their
amazement
to
see
as
she
drew
nearer
that
she
was
looking
just
as
pleasant
as
ever
they
stared
at
her
with
mouths
falling
open
was
it
possible
thought
the
twins
that
she
was
longing
to
leave
but
liked
to
say
so
and
the
letter
had
come
as
a
release
was
it
possible
thought
mr
twist
with
a
leap
of
hope
in
his
heart
that
she
was
taking
the
letter
from
a
point
of
view
and
mr
twist
to
his
infinite
relief
was
right
for
bilton
woman
of
grit
and
tenacity
was
not
in
the
habit
of
allowing
herself
to
be
dislodged
or
even
discouraged
this
was
the
opening
sentence
of
her
remarks
when
she
had
arrived
smiling
in
their
midst
had
she
not
explained
the
first
night
that
she
was
one
who
having
put
her
hand
to
the
plough
held
on
to
it
however
lively
the
movements
of
the
plough
might
be
she
would
not
conceal
from
them
she
said
that
even
bilton
had
not
especially
at
first
been
entirely
without
such
movements
he
had
settled
down
however
on
finding
he
could
trust
her
to
know
better
than
he
did
what
he
wanted
do
wise
wives
always
she
inquired
and
the
result
had
been
that
no
man
ever
had
a
more
devoted
wife
while
he
was
alive
or
a
more
devoted
widow
after
he
was
she
had
told
him
one
day
when
he
was
drawing
near
the
latter
condition
and
she
was
conversing
with
him
as
was
only
right
on
the
subject
of
wills
and
he
said
that
his
affairs
had
gone
wrong
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
she
would
be
left
a
widow
and
that
was
about
all
she
would
be
left
she
had
told
him
that
if
it
was
any
comfort
to
him
to
know
it
he
might
rely
on
it
that
he
would
have
the
most
devoted
widow
any
man
had
ever
had
and
he
said
bilton
had
odd
fancies
especially
toward
the
end
that
a
widow
was
the
one
thing
a
man
never
could
have
because
he
was
there
by
the
time
he
had
got
her
yes
bilton
had
odd
fancies
and
if
she
had
managed
as
she
did
manage
to
steer
successfully
among
them
he
being
a
man
of
ripe
parts
and
character
was
it
likely
that
encountering
odd
fancies
in
two
very
young
and
unformed
girls
oh
it
was
their
fault
that
they
were
unformed
it
was
merely
because
they
had
had
time
enough
yet
she
would
be
unable
experienced
as
she
was
to
steer
among
them
too
besides
she
had
a
heart
for
orphans
orphans
and
dumb
animals
always
had
had
a
special
appeal
for
her
no
no
mr
twist
bilton
wound
up
putting
a
hand
affectionately
on
shoulder
as
a
more
convenient
one
than
my
young
charges
are
going
to
be
left
in
the
lurch
you
may
rely
on
that
i
do
undertake
a
duty
without
carrying
it
out
why
i
feel
a
lasting
affection
for
them
already
we
made
real
progress
these
few
days
in
intimacy
and
i
just
love
to
sit
and
listen
to
all
their
fresh
young
chatter
chapter
xxix
this
was
the
last
of
mr
twist
worries
before
the
opening
day
remorseful
that
he
should
have
shirked
helping
the
annas
to
bear
bilton
besides
having
had
a
severe
fright
on
perceiving
how
near
his
shirking
had
brought
the
party
to
disaster
he
now
had
his
meals
with
the
others
and
spent
the
evenings
with
them
as
well
he
was
immensely
grateful
to
bilton
her
grit
had
saved
them
he
esteemed
and
respected
her
indeed
he
shook
hands
with
her
then
and
there
at
the
end
of
her
speech
and
told
her
he
did
and
the
least
he
could
do
after
that
was
to
come
to
dinner
but
this
very
genuine
appreciation
did
prevent
his
finding
her
at
close
quarters
what
greatly
chastened
now
only
called
temperately
a
little
much
and
the
result
was
a
really
frantic
hurrying
on
of
the
work
he
had
rather
taken
those
first
four
days
of
being
relieved
of
responsibility
in
regard
to
the
twins
to
finnicking
with
details
to
dwelling
lovingly
on
them
with
a
sense
of
having
a
margin
to
his
time
and
things
accordingly
had
considerably
slowed
down
but
after
hours
of
bilton
they
hurried
up
again
and
after
of
her
the
speed
was
headlong
at
the
end
of
hours
it
seemed
to
mr
twist
more
urgent
than
anything
he
had
ever
known
that
he
should
get
out
of
the
shanty
get
into
somewhere
with
space
in
it
and
walls
lots
of
walls
and
long
passages
between
people
doors
and
before
the
rooms
in
the
inn
were
anything
like
finished
he
insisted
on
moving
in
you
must
turn
to
on
this
last
lap
and
help
fix
them
up
he
said
to
the
twins
it
be
a
bit
uncomfortable
at
first
but
you
must
just
take
off
your
coats
to
it
and
not
mind
mind
turn
to
it
was
what
they
were
languishing
for
it
was
what
in
the
arid
hours
under
the
ilex
tree
collected
so
ignominiously
round
bilton
knee
they
had
been
panting
for
like
thirsty
dogs
with
their
tongues
out
and
such
is
the
peculiar
blessedness
of
work
that
instantly
the
moment
there
was
any
to
be
done
everything
that
was
tangled
and
irritating
fell
quite
naturally
into
its
proper
place
magically
life
straightened
itself
out
smooth
and
left
off
being
difficult
und
as
their
mother
used
to
say
dropping
into
german
whenever
a
sentence
seemed
to
her
to
sound
better
that
way
und
these
were
the
two
great
things
of
life
the
two
great
angels
as
she
assured
them
under
whose
wings
lay
happiness
with
a
hungry
zeal
with
the
violent
energy
of
reaction
the
annas
fell
upon
work
they
started
unpacking
all
the
things
they
had
bought
in
acapulco
the
linen
the
china
the
teaspoons
the
feminine
touches
that
had
been
piled
up
waiting
in
the
barn
were
pulled
out
and
undone
and
carried
indoors
they
sorted
and
they
counted
and
they
arranged
on
shelves
flew
in
and
out
with
her
arms
full
slouched
zealously
after
her
her
arms
full
too
when
she
started
but
not
nearly
so
full
when
she
got
there
owing
to
the
way
things
had
of
slipping
through
them
and
dropping
on
to
the
floor
they
were
in
a
blissful
busy
confusion
their
faces
shone
with
heat
and
happiness
here
was
liberty
here
was
freedom
here
was
true
dignity
und
when
mr
twist
as
he
did
whenever
he
could
came
and
looked
on
for
a
moment
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
big
benevolent
spectacles
so
kind
cup
seemed
full
her
dimple
never
disappeared
for
a
moment
it
was
there
all
day
long
now
and
even
when
she
was
asleep
it
still
lurked
in
the
corner
of
her
mouth
und
immense
was
the
reaction
of
that
took
hold
of
the
twins
they
could
believe
they
were
the
people
who
had
been
so
crude
and
as
to
hide
bilton
belongings
and
actually
finally
to
hide
themselves
how
absurd
how
like
children
how
unpardonably
undignified
held
forth
volubly
to
this
effect
while
she
arranged
the
china
and
listened
assentingly
with
a
kind
of
grave
ashamed
sheepishness
the
result
of
this
reaction
was
that
bilton
whose
pressure
on
them
was
relieved
by
the
necessity
of
her
too
being
in
several
places
at
once
and
who
was
displaying
her
customary
grit
now
became
the
definite
object
of
their
courtesy
they
were
the
mistresses
of
a
house
they
began
to
realize
and
as
such
owed
her
every
consideration
this
bland
attitude
was
greatly
helped
by
their
not
having
to
sleep
with
her
any
more
and
they
found
that
the
mere
coming
fresh
to
her
each
morning
made
them
feel
polite
and
besides
they
were
thoroughly
and
finally
now
declared
never
never
to
lapse
again
they
had
had
their
lesson
she
said
gone
through
a
crisis
and
done
that
which
aunt
alice
used
to
say
people
did
after
severe
trials
aged
considerably
was
quite
so
sure
her
own
recent
behaviour
had
shaken
and
shocked
her
too
much
who
would
have
thought
she
would
have
gone
like
that
gone
all
to
pieces
back
to
sheer
naughtiness
on
the
first
provocation
it
was
quite
easy
she
reflected
while
she
worked
and
cups
kept
on
detaching
themselves
mysteriously
from
her
fingers
and
tables
tumbling
over
at
her
approach
to
be
polite
and
considerate
to
somebody
you
saw
very
little
of
and
even
as
she
found
herself
doing
to
get
fond
of
the
person
but
suppose
circumstances
threw
one
again
into
the
person
continual
society
made
one
again
have
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
doubted
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
stand
such
a
test
in
spite
of
her
earnest
desire
to
behave
she
doubted
indeed
whether
anybody
ever
did
stand
that
test
successfully
look
at
husbands
meanwhile
there
seemed
no
likelihood
of
its
being
applied
again
each
of
them
had
now
a
separate
bedroom
and
bilton
had
in
the
lavish
american
fashion
her
own
bathroom
so
that
even
at
that
point
there
was
no
collision
the
twins
rooms
were
connected
by
a
bathroom
all
to
themselves
with
no
other
door
into
it
except
the
doors
from
their
bedrooms
and
mr
twist
who
dwelt
discreetly
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
also
had
a
bathroom
of
his
own
it
seemed
as
natural
for
american
architects
to
drop
bathrooms
about
thought
as
for
the
little
clouds
in
the
psalms
to
drop
fatness
they
shed
them
just
as
easily
and
the
results
were
just
as
refreshing
to
persons
hailing
from
pomerania
a
place
arid
of
bathrooms
it
was
the
last
word
of
luxury
and
comfort
to
have
one
own
their
pride
in
theirs
amused
mr
twist
used
from
childhood
to
these
civilized
arrangements
but
then
as
they
pointed
out
to
him
he
had
lived
in
pomerania
where
nothing
stood
between
you
and
being
dirty
except
the
pump
but
it
was
only
the
bathrooms
that
made
the
inn
as
planned
by
mr
twist
and
the
architect
seem
to
the
twins
the
most
perfect
the
most
wonderful
magic
little
house
in
the
world
the
intelligent
american
spirit
was
in
every
corner
and
it
was
full
of
clever
simple
devices
for
saving
labour
so
full
that
it
almost
seemed
to
the
annas
as
if
it
would
get
up
quite
unaided
at
six
every
morning
and
do
itself
and
they
were
sure
that
if
the
smallest
encouragement
were
given
to
the
it
would
cook
and
dish
up
a
dinner
all
alone
everything
in
the
house
was
on
these
lines
the
arrangements
for
serving
innumerable
teas
with
ease
were
admirable
they
were
marvels
of
economy
and
clever
the
architect
was
surprised
at
the
attention
and
thought
mr
twist
concentrated
on
this
particular
part
of
the
future
housekeeping
you
seem
sheer
crazy
on
teas
he
remarked
to
which
mr
twist
merely
replied
that
he
was
the
last
few
days
before
the
opening
were
as
full
of
present
joy
and
promise
of
yet
greater
joys
to
come
as
the
last
few
days
of
a
happy
betrothal
they
reminded
of
those
days
in
april
those
enchanting
days
she
had
always
loved
the
best
when
the
bees
get
busy
for
the
first
time
and
suddenly
there
are
wallflowers
and
a
flowering
currant
bush
and
the
sound
of
the
lawn
being
mown
and
the
smell
of
cut
grass
how
one
heart
leaps
up
to
greet
them
she
thought
what
a
thrill
of
delight
rushes
through
one
body
of
new
hope
of
delicious
expectation
even
li
koo
the
the
brief
and
rare
of
speech
seemed
to
feel
the
prevailing
satisfaction
and
harmony
and
could
be
heard
in
the
evenings
singing
strange
songs
among
his
pots
and
what
he
was
singing
only
nobody
knew
it
were
soft
chinese
hymns
of
praise
of
the
two
girls
whose
hair
was
woven
sunlight
and
whose
eyes
were
deep
and
blue
even
as
the
waters
that
washed
about
the
shores
of
his
father
for
li
koo
the
impassive
and
inarticulate
in
secret
seethed
with
passion
which
was
why
his
cakes
were
so
wonderful
he
had
to
express
himself
somehow
but
while
up
on
their
slopes
mr
twist
and
his
party
he
always
thought
of
them
as
his
party
were
innocently
and
happily
busy
full
of
hopefulness
and
mutual
goodwill
down
in
the
town
and
in
the
houses
scattered
over
the
lovely
country
round
the
town
people
were
talking
everybody
knew
about
the
house
teapot
twist
was
doing
up
for
the
daily
paper
had
told
them
that
edward
a
twist
had
bought
the
long
uninhabited
farmhouse
in
pepper
lane
known
as
batt
and
was
converting
it
into
a
little
for
his
widowed
mother
launching
once
more
into
french
as
though
there
were
something
about
mr
twist
magnetic
to
that
language
everybody
knew
this
and
it
was
perfectly
natural
for
a
easterner
to
have
a
little
place
out
west
even
if
the
choice
of
the
little
place
was
whimsical
but
what
about
the
miss
twinklers
who
and
what
were
they
and
also
why
there
were
three
weeks
between
the
departure
of
the
twist
party
from
the
cosmopolitan
and
the
opening
of
the
inn
and
in
that
time
much
had
been
done
in
the
way
of
conjecture
the
first
waves
of
it
flowed
out
from
the
cosmopolitan
and
were
met
almost
at
once
by
waves
flowing
in
from
the
town
curiosity
gave
place
to
excited
curiosity
when
the
rumour
got
about
that
the
cosmopolitan
had
been
obliged
to
ask
mr
twist
to
take
his
somewhere
else
was
it
possible
the
cute
little
girls
so
well
known
by
sight
on
main
street
going
from
shop
to
shop
were
secretly
scandalous
it
seemed
almost
unbelievable
but
luckily
nothing
was
really
unbelievable
the
manager
of
the
hotel
dropped
in
upon
casually
by
one
guest
after
the
other
and
interviewed
as
well
by
determined
gentlemen
from
the
local
press
was
not
to
be
drawn
his
reserve
was
most
interesting
miss
heap
knitted
and
knitted
and
was
persistently
enigmatic
her
silence
was
most
exciting
on
the
other
hand
ridding
attitude
was
merely
one
of
contempt
dismissing
the
twinklers
with
a
heavy
gesture
why
think
or
trouble
about
a
pair
of
chits
like
that
they
had
gone
albert
was
quiet
again
and
was
that
the
gong
for
dinner
but
doubts
as
to
the
private
morals
of
the
twist
presently
were
superseded
by
much
graver
and
more
perturbing
doubts
nobody
knew
when
exactly
this
development
took
place
acapulco
had
been
enjoying
the
first
set
of
doubts
there
was
no
denying
that
doubts
about
somebody
else
morals
were
not
unpleasant
they
did
give
one
if
one
examined
one
sensations
carefully
a
distinct
agreeable
tickle
they
did
add
the
kick
to
lives
which
if
they
had
been
virtuous
for
a
very
long
time
like
the
lives
of
the
riddings
or
virgin
for
a
very
long
time
like
the
life
of
miss
heap
were
apt
to
be
flat
but
from
the
doubts
that
presently
appeared
and
overshadowed
the
earlier
ones
one
got
nothing
but
genuine
discomfort
and
uneasiness
nobody
knew
how
or
when
they
started
quite
suddenly
they
were
there
this
was
in
the
november
before
america
coming
into
the
war
the
feeling
in
acapulco
was
violently
the
great
majority
of
the
inhabitants
permanent
and
temporary
were
deeply
concerned
at
the
conduct
of
their
country
in
not
having
immediately
after
the
torpedoing
of
the
joined
the
allies
they
found
it
difficult
to
understand
and
were
puzzled
and
suspicious
as
well
as
humiliated
in
their
national
pride
germans
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
or
who
came
across
from
the
east
for
the
winter
were
politely
tolerated
but
the
attitude
toward
them
was
one
of
growing
watchfulness
and
distrust
and
week
by
week
the
whispered
stories
of
spies
and
and
secret
stores
of
arms
in
these
people
cellars
or
back
gardens
grew
more
insistent
and
detailed
there
certainly
had
been
at
least
one
spy
a
real
authentic
one
afterward
shot
in
england
who
had
stayed
and
the
nerves
of
the
inhabitants
had
that
jumpiness
on
this
subject
with
which
the
inhabitants
of
other
countries
have
long
been
familiar
all
the
customary
inexplicable
lights
were
seen
all
the
customary
mysterious
big
motor
cars
rushed
at
forbidden
and
yet
unhindered
speeds
along
unusual
roads
at
unaccountable
hours
all
the
customary
signalling
out
to
sea
was
observed
and
passionately
sworn
to
by
otherwise
calm
people
it
was
possible
the
inhabitants
found
to
believe
with
ease
things
about
germans
those
who
were
having
difficulty
with
religion
wished
it
were
equally
easy
to
believe
things
about
god
there
was
nothing
germans
would
think
of
in
the
way
of
plotting
and
nothing
they
would
having
thought
of
it
carry
out
with
deadly
thoroughness
and
patience
and
into
this
uneasy
hotbed
of
readiness
to
believe
the
worst
arrived
the
twinkler
twins
rolling
their
r
about
it
needed
but
a
few
inquiries
to
discover
that
none
of
the
young
ladies
schools
in
the
neighbourhood
had
been
approached
on
their
behalf
hardly
inquiries
mere
casual
talk
was
sufficient
ordinary
chatting
with
the
principals
of
these
establishments
when
one
met
them
at
the
lectures
and
instructive
evenings
the
more
serious
members
of
the
community
organized
and
supported
not
many
of
the
winter
visitors
went
to
these
meetings
but
miss
heap
did
miss
heap
had
a
restless
soul
it
was
restless
because
it
was
worried
by
perpetual
thirst
she
herself
tell
after
what
it
was
righteousness
for
she
knew
she
was
still
worldly
so
perhaps
it
was
culture
anyhow
she
would
give
culture
a
chance
and
accordingly
she
went
to
the
instructive
evenings
here
she
met
that
other
side
of
acapulco
which
does
play
bridge
and
is
proud
to
know
nothing
of
polo
which
believes
in
education
and
goes
in
for
mind
training
and
welfare
work
which
is
that
is
well
off
nobody
here
had
been
asked
to
educate
the
twinklers
no
classes
had
been
joined
by
them
miss
heap
was
so
enigmatic
she
who
was
naturally
of
an
unquiet
and
tongue
that
this
graver
more
occupied
section
of
the
inhabitants
was
instantly
as
much
pervaded
by
suspicions
as
the
idlest
of
the
visitors
in
the
hotels
and
country
houses
it
waved
aside
the
innocent
appearance
and
obvious
extreme
youth
of
the
suspects
useless
to
look
like
cherubs
if
it
were
german
cherubs
you
looked
like
useless
being
very
nearly
children
if
it
were
german
children
you
very
nearly
were
why
precisely
these
qualities
would
be
selected
by
those
terribly
clever
germans
for
the
furtherance
of
their
nefarious
schemes
it
would
be
quite
in
keeping
with
the
german
national
character
that
character
of
bottomless
artfulness
to
pick
out
two
such
young
girls
with
just
that
type
of
empty
baby
face
and
send
them
over
to
help
weave
the
gigantic
invisible
web
with
which
america
was
presently
to
be
choked
dead
the
serious
section
of
acapulco
the
section
that
thought
hit
on
this
explanation
of
the
twinklers
with
no
difficulty
whatever
once
its
suspicions
were
roused
because
it
was
used
to
being
able
to
explain
everything
instantly
it
was
proud
of
its
explanation
and
presented
it
to
the
town
with
much
the
same
air
of
deprecating
but
conscious
achievement
with
which
one
presents
then
there
was
the
lawyer
to
whom
mr
twist
had
gone
about
the
guardianship
he
said
nothing
but
he
was
clear
in
his
mind
that
the
girls
were
german
and
that
mr
twist
wanted
to
hide
it
he
had
thought
more
highly
of
mr
twist
intelligence
than
this
why
hide
it
america
was
a
neutral
country
technically
she
was
neutral
and
germans
could
come
and
go
as
they
pleased
why
unnecessarily
set
tongues
wagging
he
did
not
being
of
a
continuous
shrewd
alertness
himself
a
continuous
and
minute
consideration
of
consequences
realize
and
if
he
had
he
would
have
believed
the
affectionate
simplicity
and
unworldliness
of
mr
twist
if
it
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
he
would
have
dismissed
it
as
a
pose
for
a
man
who
makes
money
in
any
quantity
worth
handling
is
affectionately
simple
and
unworldly
he
is
calculating
and
steely
the
lawyer
was
puzzled
how
did
mr
twist
manage
to
have
a
forehead
and
a
fortune
like
that
and
yet
be
a
fool
true
he
had
a
funny
sort
of
face
on
him
once
you
got
down
to
the
nose
part
and
what
came
after
a
family
sort
of
face
thought
the
lawyer
a
sort
of
rice
pudding
face
the
lawyer
listened
intently
to
all
the
talk
and
rumours
while
himself
saying
nothing
in
spite
of
being
a
married
man
his
scruples
about
honour
had
been
blunted
by
the
urge
to
personal
freedom
and
the
necessity
for
daily
that
sometimes
afflicts
those
who
have
wives
he
remained
honourably
silent
as
he
had
said
he
would
but
he
listened
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
either
there
was
a
quite
incredible
amount
of
stupidity
about
the
twist
party
or
that
there
was
something
queer
what
he
did
know
and
what
nobody
knew
was
that
the
house
being
got
ready
with
such
haste
was
to
be
an
inn
he
like
the
rest
of
the
world
took
the
newspapers
theory
of
the
house
for
granted
and
it
was
only
the
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
that
respectable
lady
the
widowed
mrs
twist
which
kept
the
suspicions
a
little
damped
down
they
smouldered
hesitating
beneath
this
expectation
for
teapot
twist
family
life
had
been
voluminously
described
in
the
entire
american
press
when
first
his
invention
caught
on
and
it
was
known
to
be
pure
there
had
been
snapshots
of
the
home
at
clark
where
he
had
been
born
of
the
home
at
clark
west
aspect
where
he
would
die
mr
twist
read
with
mild
surprise
that
his
liveliest
wish
was
to
die
in
the
old
home
of
the
corner
in
the
clark
churchyard
where
he
would
probably
be
entombed
with
an
inset
showing
his
father
gravestone
on
which
would
clearly
be
read
the
announcement
that
he
was
the
resurrection
and
the
life
and
there
was
an
inset
of
his
mother
swathed
in
the
black
symbols
of
ungluttable
grief
a
most
creditable
mother
and
there
were
accounts
of
the
activities
of
another
near
relative
that
uncle
charles
who
presided
over
the
church
of
heavenly
refreshment
in
new
york
and
a
snapshot
of
his
macerated
and
unrefreshed
body
in
a
cassock
a
most
creditable
uncle
these
articles
had
appeared
so
very
long
ago
and
the
impression
survived
and
was
general
that
mr
twist
antecedents
were
unimpeachable
if
it
were
true
that
the
house
was
for
his
mother
and
she
was
shortly
arriving
then
although
still
very
odd
and
unintelligible
it
was
probable
that
his
being
there
now
with
the
two
germans
was
after
all
capable
of
explanation
not
much
of
an
explanation
though
even
the
moderates
who
took
this
view
felt
this
one
was
with
germans
these
days
if
one
could
help
it
there
was
no
getting
away
from
that
simple
fact
the
inevitable
deduction
was
that
mr
twist
could
help
it
why
could
he
help
it
was
he
enslaved
by
a
scandalous
passion
for
them
a
passion
planned
for
him
by
the
german
government
which
was
known
to
have
lists
of
the
notable
citizens
of
the
united
states
with
photographs
and
details
of
their
probable
weaknesses
and
was
exactly
informed
of
their
movements
he
had
met
the
twinklers
so
it
was
reported
on
a
steamer
coming
over
from
england
of
course
all
arranged
by
the
german
government
that
was
the
peculiar
evil
greatness
of
this
dangerous
people
announced
the
serious
section
of
acapulco
again
with
the
air
that
nothing
was
too
private
or
too
petty
to
escape
their
attention
to
be
turned
to
their
own
wicked
uses
they
were
as
economical
of
the
smallest
scraps
of
possible
usefulness
as
a
french
cook
of
the
smallest
scraps
and
leavings
of
food
everything
was
turned
to
account
nothing
was
wasted
even
the
mosquitoes
in
germany
were
not
wasted
they
contained
juices
germans
had
discovered
especially
after
having
been
in
contact
with
human
beings
and
with
these
juices
the
talented
but
unscrupulous
germans
made
explosives
could
one
sufficiently
distrust
a
nation
that
did
things
like
that

people
were
so
much
preoccupied
by
the
twinkler
problem
that
they
were
less
interested
than
they
otherwise
would
have
been
in
the
advertisements
and
when
the
one
appeared
announcing
that
the
open

would
open
wide
on
the
of

and
exhorting
the
public
to
watch
the
signposts
they
merely
remarked
that
it
was
then
the
title
of
a
book
after
all
mr
twist
would
have
been
surprised
and
nettled
if
he
had
known
how
little
curiosity
his
advertisements
were
exciting
he
would
have
been
horrified
if

reason
as
it
was
he
did
know
anything
he
was
too
busy
too
deeply
absorbed
to
be
vulnerable
to
rumour
he
and
the
twins
and
bilton
were
safe
from
it
inside
their
magic
circle
of
und
sometimes
he
was
seen
in
main
street
that
street
in
acapulco
through
which
everybody
passes
at
certain
hours
of
the
morning
looking
as
though
he
had
a
great
deal
to
do
and
very
little
time
to
do
it
in
and
once
or
twice
the
twinklers
were
seen
there
also
apparently
very
busy
but
they
did
now
come
alone
bilton
the
lady
from
los
angeles
acapulco
knew
all
about
her
and
admitted
she
was
a
lady
of
strictest
integrity
and
unimpeachable
character
but
this
only
made
the
twinkler
problem
more
obscure
came
too
and
seemed
judging
from
the
animation
of
her
talk
to
be
on
the
best
of
terms
with
her
charges
but
once
an
idea
has
got
into
people
heads
remarked
the
lawyer
who
was
nudged
by
the
friend
he
was
walking
with
as
the
attractive
trio
were
seen
approaching
bilton
with
her
black
dress
and
her
snowy
hair
setting
off
as
they
in
their
turn
set
her
off
the
twins
in
their
clean
white
frocks
and
shining
youth
once
an
idea
has
got
into
heads
it
sticks
it
is
slow
to
get
in
and
impossible
to
get
out
yet
on
the
face
of
it
was
it
likely
that
bilton
say
interrupted
his
friend
since
when
have
you
joined
up
with
the
and
only
his
personal
affection
for
the
lawyer
restrained
him
from
using
the
terrible
word
but
it
had
been
in
his
mind
the
day
before
the
opening
miss
heap
heard
from
an
acquaintance
in
the
east
to
whom
she
had
written
in
her
uneasiness
and
who
was
staying
with
some
people
living
in
clark
miss
heap
wrote
soon
after
the
departure
she
did
see
why
she
should
call
it
by
its
proper
name
and
say
right
out
expulsion
of
the
twist
party
from
the
cosmopolitan
but
letters
take
a
long
time
to
get
east
and
answers
take
the
same
long
time
to
come
back
in
and
messages
are
sometimes
slow
in
being
delivered
if
the
other
person
does
realize
as
one
does
oneself
the
tremendous
interests
that
are
at
stake
what
could
be
a
more
tremendous
interest
and
one
more
adapted
to
the
american
genius
than
public
morals
miss
heap
wrote
before
the
sinister
rumours
of
german
machinations
had
got
about
she
was
still
merely
at
the
stage
of
uneasiness
in
regard
to
the
morals
of
the
twist
party
she
sleep
at
night
for
thinking
of
them
of
course
if
it
were
true
that
his
mother
was
coming
out
but
was
she
miss
heap
somehow
felt
unable
to
believe
it
do
tell
your
friends
in
clark
she
wrote
how
we
all
are
to
hear
that
mrs
twist
is
going
to
be
one
of
us
in
our
sunny
refuge
here
this
winter
a
real
warm
welcome
awaits
her
her
son
is
working
day
and
night
getting
the
house
ready
for
her
helped
indefatigably
by
the
two
miss
twinklers
she
had
to
wait
over
a
fortnight
for
the
answer
and
by
the
time
she
got
it
those
other
more
terrible
doubts
had
arisen
the
doubts
as
to
the
exact
position
occupied
by
the
twinklers
and
mr
twist
in
the
german
secret
plans
for
first
the
pervasion
and
second
the
invasion
of
america
and
on
reading
the
opening
lines
of
the
letter
miss
heap
found
she
had
to
sit
down
for
her
legs
gave
way
beneath
her
it
appeared
that
mrs
twist
had
known
where
her
son
was
till
miss
heap
letter
came
he
had
left
clark
in
company
of
the
two
girls
mentioned
and
about
whom
his
mother
knew
nothing
the
very
morning
after
his
arrival
home
from
his
long
absence
in
europe
that
was
all
his
mother
knew
she
was
quite
broken
coming
on
the
top
of
all
her
other
sorrow
her
only
son
behaviour
had
been
a
fearful
perhaps
a
finishing
blow
but
she
was
such
a
good
woman
that
she
still
prayed
for
him
clark
was
horrified
his
mother
had
decided
at
first
she
would
try
to
shield
him
and
say
nothing
but
when
she
found
that
nobody
had
the
least
idea
of
what
he
had
done
she
felt
she
owed
it
to
her
friends
to
be
open
and
have
no
secrets
from
them
whatever
it
cost
her
in
suffering
and
humiliation
she
would
be
frank
anything
was
better
than
keeping
up
false
appearances
to
friends
who
believed
in
you
she
was
a
brave
woman
a
splendid
woman
the
girls
poor
mrs
twist
were
germans
on
reading
this
miss
heap
was
all
of
a
tingle
her
worst
suspicions
had
been
half
bad
enough
here
was
everything
just
about
as
black
as
it
could
be
and
mr
twist
a
and
universally
respected
american
citizen
had
been
turned
by
means
of
those
girls
playing
upon
weaknesses
she
shuddered
to
think
of
but
that
she
had
reason
to
believe
from
books
she
had
studied
and
conversations
she
had
reluctantly
taken
part
in
were
not
altogether
uncommon
into
a
of
the
german
government
what
should
she
do
what
should
she
say
to
whom
should
she
go
which
was
the
proper
line
of
warning
for
her
to
take
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
presence
of
these
people
on
the
pacific
coast
was
a
real
menace
to
its
safety
moral
and
physical
but
how
get
rid
of
them
and
if
they
were
got
rid
of
would
it
only
be
exposing
some
other
part
of
america
less
watchful
less
perhaps
able
to
take
care
of
itself
to
the
ripening
and
furtherance
of
their
schemes
whatever
their
schemes
might
be
even
at
that
moment
miss
heap
unconsciously
felt
that
to
let
the
twinklers
go
would
be
to
lose
thrills
and
she
was
really
thrilled
she
prickled
with
excitement
and
horror
her
circulation
had
been
so
good
for
years
she
was
one
to
dissect
her
feelings
so
she
had
no
idea
of
how
thoroughly
she
was
enjoying
herself
and
it
was
while
she
sat
alone
in
her
bedroom
her
fingers
clasping
and
unclasping
the
arms
of
her
chair
her
feet
nervously
nibbing
up
and
down
on
the
thick
soft
carpet
hesitating
as
to
the
best
course
for
her
to
take
holding
her
knowledge
meanwhile
tight
hugging
it
for
a
little
altogether
to
herself
her
very
own
shared
as
yet
by
no
one
it
was
while
she
sat
there
that
people
out
of
doors
in
acapulco
itself
along
the
main
roads
out
in
the
country
towards
zamora
on
the
north
and
san
blas
on
the
south
became
suddenly
aware
of
new
signposts
they
had
been
there
the
day
before
they
all
turned
towards
the
spot
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
where
pepper
lane
was
they
all
pointed
with
a
long
white
finger
in
that
direction
and
on
them
all
was
written
in
plain
letters
beneath
which
the
distance
in
miles
or
fractions
of
a
mile
was
clearly
marked
the
open
curiosity
was
roused
at
last
people
meeting
each
other
in
main
street
stopped
to
talk
about
these
arms
wondered
where
and
what
they
were
and
decided
to
follow
the
signposts
that
afternoon
in
their
cars
and
track
them
down
they
made
up
parties
to
go
and
track
together
it
would
be
a
relief
to
have
something
a
little
different
to
do
what
on
earth
could
the
open
arms
be
hopes
were
expressed
that
they
were
something
religious
awful
to
follow
signposts
out
into
the
country
only
to
find
they
landed
you
in
a
at
lunch
in
the
hotels
and
everywhere
where
people
were
together
the
signposts
were
discussed
miss
heap
heard
them
being
discussed
from
her
solitary
table
but
was
so
much
taken
up
with
her
own
exciting
thoughts
that
she
hardly
noticed
after
lunch
however
as
she
was
passing
out
of
the
restaurant
still
full
of
her
unshared
news
and
still
uncertain
as
to
whom
she
should
tell
it
first
ridding
called
out
from
his
table
and
said
he
supposed
she
was
going
too
they
had
been
a
little
chilly
to
each
other
since
the
afternoon
of
the
conversation
with
the
twinklers
but
he
would
have
called
out
to
any
one
at
that
moment
he
was
sitting
waiting
while
ridding
finished
her
lunch
his
own
lunch
finished
long
ago
and
was
in
the
condition
of
muffled
but
extreme
exasperation
which
the
unoccupied
watching
of
ridding
at
meals
produced
every
day
three
times
this
happened
that
ridding
got
through
his
meal
first
by
at
least
twenty
minutes
and
then
sat
trying
not
to
mind
ridding
she
was
aware
of
these
efforts
they
would
greatly
have
shocked
her
for
to
try
not
to
mind
one
wife
surely
is
what
decent
loving
husbands
ever
have
to
do
going
where
asked
miss
heap
stopping
by
the
table
whereupon
ridding
had
the
slight
relief
of
getting
up
ridding
continued
to
eat
impassively
following
these
new
signposts
that
are
all
over
the
place
said
ridding
sort
of
business
yes
i
like
to
were
you
thinking
of
going
mrs
ridding
after
our
nap
said
ridding
steadily
eating
i
take
you
car
at
four
albert
she
did
raise
her
eyes
from
her
plate
and
as
miss
heap
well
knew
that
ridding
was
not
open
to
conversation
during
meals
and
as
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
ridding
she
expressed
her
thanks
and
pleasure
and
temporarily
left
them
this
was
a
day
of
shocks
and
thrills
when
the
big
limousine
symbol
of
ridding
power
for
ridding
could
for
the
life
of
him
see
why
he
should
have
to
provide
a
strange
old
lady
with
cars
and
yet
did
so
on
an
increasing
scale
of
splendour
arrived
at
the
turn
on
the
main
road
to
san
blas
which
leads
into
pepper
lane
and
was
confronted
by
the
final
signpost
pointing
up
it
for
the
first
time
the
open
arms
and
the
twist
and
twinkler
party
entered
miss
heap
mind
in
company
so
too
did
they
enter
ridding
mind
and
they
only
remained
outside
ridding
because
of
her
profound
uninterest
her
thoughts
were
merged
in
aspic
that
was
the
worst
of
aspic
when
it
was
as
good
as
it
was
at
the
cosmopolitan
one
was
able
to
leave
off
eating
it
quite
in
time
and
then
unfortunately
had
to
go
on
thinking
of
it
afterwards
the
twist
house
remembered
her
companions
simultaneously
was
in
pepper
lane
odd
that
this
other
thing
whatever
it
was
should
happen
to
be
there
too
miss
heap
said
nothing
but
sat
very
straight
and
alert
her
eyes
everywhere
ridding
of
course
said
nothing
either
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
mentioned
the
word
twist
which
so
instantly
and
inevitably
suggested
that
other
and
highly
controversial
word
twinkler
but
he
too
sat
all
eyes
for
anyhow
he
might
in
passing
get
a
glimpse
of
the
place
containing
those
cunning
little
bits
of
youngness
the
twinkler
sisters
and
even
with
any
luck
a
glimpse
of
their
very
selves
up
the
lane
went
the
limousine
slowly
because
of
the
cars
in
front
of
it
it
was
one
of
a
string
of
cars
for
the
day
was
lovely
there
was
no
polo
and
nobody
happened
to
be
giving
a
party
all
the
way
out
from
acapulco
they
had
only
had
to
follow
other
cars
cars
were
going
and
cars
were
coming
back
the
cars
going
were
full
of
solemn
people
pathetically
anxious
to
be
interested
the
cars
coming
back
were
full
of
animated
people
who
evidently
had
achieved
interest
miss
heap
became
more
and
more
alert
as
they
approached
the
bend
in
the
lane
round
which
the
twist
house
was
situated
she
had
been
there
before
making
a
point
of
getting
a
friend
to
motor
her
past
it
in
order
to
see
what
she
could
for
herself
but
ridding
in
spite
of
his
desire
to
go
and
have
a
look
too
had
always
each
time
he
tried
to
found
ridding
barring
the
way
so
that
he
did
exactly
know
where
it
was
and
when
on
turning
the
corner
the
car
suddenly
stopped
and
putting
his
head
out
he
was
sitting
backwards
he
saw
a
great
signboard
such
as
he
was
accustomed
to
in
pictures
of
ancient
english
village
greens
with
the
open
arms
in
medieval
letters
painted
on
it
all
he
said
was
guess
we
run
it
to
earth
miss
heap
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
staring
ridding
her
mind
blocked
by
aspic
was
receiving
impressions
she
gazed
with
heavy
eyes
straight
in
front
of
her
there
she
saw
cars
many
cars
all
stopped
at
this
particular
spot
with
a
dull
sensation
of
fathomless
fatigue
she
dimly
wondered
at
them
looks
as
though
it
a
hostelry
said
ridding
who
remembered
his
dickens
and
he
blinked
up
craning
his
head
out
at
the
signboard
on
which
through
a
gap
in
the
branches
of
the
pepper
trees
a
shaft
of
brilliant
late
afternoon
sun
was
striking
do
see
one
though
he
jerked
his
thumb
up
back
of
the
trees
there
i
reckon
he
said
then
he
prepared
to
open
the
door
and
go
and
have
a
look
a
hand
shot
out
of
miss
heap
lap
at
him
do
she
said
quickly
do
mr
ridding
there
was
a
little
green
gate
in
the
thick
hedge
that
grew
behind
the
pepper
trees
and
some
people
he
knew
who
had
been
in
the
car
in
front
were
walking
up
to
it
some
other
people
he
knew
had
already
got
to
it
and
were
standing
talking
together
with
what
looked
like
leaflets
in
their
hands
these
leaflets
came
out
of
a
green
wooden
box
fastened
on
to
one
of
the
with
the
words
you
take
painted
on
it
ridding
naturally
wanted
to
go
and
take
one
and
here
was
miss
heap
laying
hold
of
him
and
saying
do
do
what
he
asked
looking
down
at
her
his
hand
on
the
door
hello
ridding
called
out
one
of
the
people
he
knew
no
good
getting
out
show
does
open
till
at
four
ca
get
in
gate
bolted
nothing
doing
and
then
the
man
detached
himself
from
the
group
at
the
gate
and
came
over
to
the
car
with
a
leaflet
in
his
hand
say
he
said
how
are

miss
heap

your
humble
servant

of
his
name
on
this
book
of
words
but
it
the
house
he
was
doing
up
all
right
and
it
is

ridding
and
study
it
i
get
another
and
taking
off
his
hat
a
second
time
to
the
ladies
he
went
back
to
his
friends
in
great
agitation
miss
heap
turned
to
ridding
whose
mind
galvanized
by
the
magic
words
twist
and
twinkler
was
slowly
heaving
itself
free
of
aspic
perhaps
we
had
best
go
back
to
the
hotel
mrs
ridding
said
miss
heap
her
voice
shaking
there
something
i
wish
particularly
to
tell
you
i
ought
to
have
done
so
this
morning
directly
i
knew
but
i
had
no
idea
of
course
that
this
she
waved
a
hand
at
the
signboard
and
collapsed
into
speechlessness
albert
hotel
directed
ridding
and
ridding
clutching
the
leaflet
his
face
congested
with
suppressed
emotions
obediently
handed
on
the
order
through
the
to
the
chauffeur
chapter
xxxi
it
said
the
twins
looking
round
the
this
was
next
day
at
a
quarter
to
four
they
had
been
looking
round
saying
it
was
perfect
at
intervals
since
the
morning
each
time
they
finished
getting
another
of
the
little
tables
ready
each
time
they
brought
in
and
set
down
another
bowl
of
flowers
they
stood
back
and
gazed
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
said
with
one
voice
mr
twist
though
the
house
was
not
as
we
have
seen
quite
as
sober
quite
as
restrained
in
its
effect
as
he
had
intended
was
obliged
to
admit
that
it
did
look
very
pretty
and
so
did
the
annas
especially
the
annas
they
looked
so
pretty
in
the
frocks
and
little
dutch
caps
and
big
muslin
aprons
that
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
cleaned
them
carefully
so
as
to
have
a
thoroughly
uninterrupted
view
and
as
they
stood
at
a
quarter
to
four
gazing
round
the
room
he
stood
gazing
at
them
and
when
they
said
it
he
said
indicating
them
with
his
thumb
same
here
and
then
they
all
laughed
for
they
were
all
very
happy
and
bilton
arrayed
exactly
as
mr
twist
had
pictured
her
when
he
engaged
her
in
handsome
black
her
white
hair
beautifully
brushed
and
neat
crossed
over
to
the
annas
and
gave
each
of
them
a
hearty
kiss
for
luck
she
said
which
mr
twist
watched
with
an
odd
feeling
of
jealousy
i
like
to
do
that
he
thought
filled
with
a
sudden
desire
to
hug
then
he
said
it
out
loud
i
like
to
do
that
he
said
boldly
and
added
as
it
the
opening
day
i
do
think
it
would
afford
you
any
permanent
satisfaction
said
placidly
there
nothing
really
to
be
gained
we
think
by
kissing
of
course
she
added
politely
to
bilton
we
like
it
very
much
as
an
expression
of
esteem
then
why
not
in
that
spirit
began
mr
twist
we
do
hold
with
kissing
said
quickly
turning
very
red
intolerable
to
be
kissed
if
it
had
to
be
done
at
all
kissing
should
be
done
quietly
she
thought
but
she
and
did
hold
with
it
anyhow
never
never
to
her
amazement
she
found
tears
in
her
eyes
well
of
all
the
liquid
idiots
it
must
be
that
she
was
so
happy
she
had
never
been
so
happy
where
on
earth
had
her
handkerchief
got
to
hello
said
mr
twist
staring
at
her
looked
at
her
quickly
it
merely
bliss
she
said
taking
the
corner
of
her
beautiful
new
muslin
apron
to
christopher
eyes
excess
of
it
we
are
you
know
she
said
smiling
over
her
shoulder
at
mr
twist
so
that
the
corner
of
her
apron
being
undirected
began
dabbing
at
christopher
perfectly
tearless
ears
quite
extraordinarily
happy
and
all
through
you
nevertheless
she
continued
addressing
her
with
firmness
while
she
finished
her
eyes
and
began
her
nose
you
may
like
to
be
reminded
that
there
only
ten
minutes
left
now
before
all
those
cars
that
were
here
yesterday
come
again
and
you
would
wish
to
embark
on
your
career
as
a
waitress
hampered
by
an
ugly
face
would
you
but
half
an
hour
later
no
cars
had
come
pepper
lane
was
still
empty
the
long
shadows
lay
across
it
in
a
beautiful
quiet
and
the
crickets
in
the
grass
chirruped
undisturbed
twice
sounds
were
heard
as
if
something
was
coming
up
it
and
everybody
flew
to
their
posts
li
koo
to
the
boiling
water
bilton
to
her
raised
desk
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
the
twins
to
the
door
but
the
sounds
passed
on
along
the
road
and
died
away
round
the
next
corner
at
four
the
of
the
open
arms
was
sitting
about
silently
in
a
state
of
increasing
uneasiness
when
ridding
walked
in
there
had
been
no
noise
of
a
car
to
announce
him
he
just
walked
in
mopping
his
forehead
for
he
had
come
in
the
jitney
omnibus
to
the
nearest
point
and
had
done
the
last
mile
on
his
own
feet
ridding
thought
he
was
writing
letters
in
the
she
herself
was
in
a
big
chair
on
the
verandah
and
with
miss
heap
and
most
of
the
other
guests
was
discussing
the
open
arms
in
all
its
probable
significance
he
had
been
able
to
get
away
sooner
because
of
the
nap
he
had
gone
through
with
the
nap
from
start
to
finish
so
as
not
to
rouse
suspicion
he
arrived
very
hot
but
with
a
feeling
of
running
of
risks
that
gave
him
great
satisfaction
he
knew
that
he
would
cool
down
again
presently
and
that
then
the
consequences
of
his
behaviour
would
be
unpleasant
to
reflect
upon
but
meanwhile
his
blood
was
up
he
walked
in
feeling
not
a
day
older
than
thirty
most
gratifying
sensation
the
after
a
moment
surprise
rushed
to
greet
him
never
was
a
man
more
welcome
never
had
ridding
been
so
warmly
welcomed
anywhere
in
his
life
now
is
this
real
homey
he
said
beaming
at
who
took
his
stick
wish
i
known
you
were
going
to
do
it
for
then
i
have
had
something
to
look
forward
to
will
you
have
tea
or
coffee
asked
trying
to
look
very
solemn
and
like
a
family
butler
but
her
voice
quivering
with
eagerness
or
perhaps
you
would
prefer
frothed
chocolate
each
of
these
beverages
can
be
provided
either
hot
or
iced
there
as
well
said
tumultuously
in
spite
of
also
trying
to
look
like
a
family
butler
have
if
i
were
you
there
more
body
in
it
cold
delicious
body
and
you
look
so
hot
hot
things
should
always
as
soon
as
possible
be
united
to
cold
things
so
as
to
restore
the
proper
balance
and
there
some
heavenly
stuff
called
hot
you
know
but
if
you
have
at
the
same
time
it
wo
matter
said
hanging
up
his
hat
for
him
i
do
know
whether
studied
the
leaflets
she
continued
but
in
case
you
have
i
feel
i
ought
to
conceal
from
you
that
the
price
is
five
dollars
whatever
you
have
so
that
said
you
need
bother
about
trying
to
save
for
you
ca
then
i
have
tea
to
start
with
and
see
how
i
get
on
said
ridding
sitting
down
in
the
chair
held
for
him
and
beaming
up
at
her
she
flicked
an
imaginary
grain
of
dust
off
the
cloth
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
to
convey
to
him
that
she
knew
her
business
and
hurried
away
to
give
the
order
indeed
they
both
hurried
away
to
give
the
order
say
called
out
ridding
for
he
thought
one
anna
would
have
been
enough
for
this
and
he
was
pining
to
talk
to
them
but
the
twins
to
be
stopped
from
both
giving
the
very
first
order
and
they
disappeared
together
into
the
pantry
bilton
sat
in
the
farthest
corner
at
her
desk
apparently
absorbed
in
an
enormous
ledger
in
this
ledger
she
was
to
keep
accounts
and
to
enter
the
number
of
teas
and
from
this
high
seat
she
was
to
preside
over
the
activities
of
the
she
had
retired
hastily
to
it
on
the
unexpected
entrance
of
ridding
and
pen
in
hand
was
endeavouring
to
look
as
if
she
were
totting
up
figures
as
the
pages
were
blank
this
was
a
little
difficult
and
it
was
difficult
to
sit
there
quiet
she
wanted
to
get
down
and
go
and
chat
with
the
guest
she
felt
she
had
quite
a
good
deal
she
could
say
to
him
she
had
a
great
itch
to
go
and
talk
but
mr
twist
had
been
particular
that
to
begin
with
till
the
room
was
fairly
full
he
and
she
should
leave
the
guests
entirely
to
the
annas
he
himself
was
going
to
keep
much
in
the
background
at
all
times
but
through
the
door
of
his
office
he
could
see
and
hear
and
he
could
help
thinking
as
he
sat
there
watching
and
observed
the
effulgence
of
the
beams
the
old
gentleman
just
arrived
turned
on
the
twins
that
the
first
guest
appeared
to
be
extraordinarily
and
undesirably
affectionate
he
thought
he
had
seen
him
at
the
cosmopolitan
but
was
sure
he
did
know
that
the
annas
after
their
conversation
with
him
there
felt
towards
him
as
old
friends
and
he
considered
their
manner
was
a
little
unduly
familiar
perhaps
after
all
he
thought
uneasily
bilton
had
better
do
the
waiting
and
the
annas
sit
with
him
in
the
office
the
ledger
could
be
written
up
at
the
end
of
the
day
or
he
could
hire
somebody
mr
twist
felt
worried
and
pulled
at
his
ear
and
why
was
there
only
one
guest
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
five
and
this
time
yesterday
the
road
had
been
choked
with
cars
he
felt
very
much
worried
with
every
minute
this
absence
of
guests
grew
more
and
more
remarkable
perhaps
he
had
better
this
beings
the
opening
day
go
in
and
welcome
the
solitary
one
there
was
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
to
elaborate
the
idea
of
the
inn
for
his
edification
so
that
he
could
hand
on
what
he
had
heard
to
those
others
who
so
unaccountably
had
come
he
got
up
and
went
into
the
other
room
and
just
as
was
reappearing
with
the
teapot
followed
by
with
a
tray
of
cakes
ridding
who
was
sitting
up
expectantly
and
giving
his
tie
a
little
pat
of
adjustment
perceived
bearing
down
upon
him
that
fellow
teapot
twist
this
was
a
blow
he
had
run
risks
and
walked
in
the
afternoon
heat
to
sit
and
talk
to
twist
ridding
was
a
friendly
and
amiable
old
man
and
at
any
other
time
would
have
talked
to
him
with
pleasure
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
for
the
twinklers
as
one
makes
up
one
mind
for
a
certain
dish
and
is
ravaged
by
strange
fury
if
it
is
produced
besides
hang
it
all
he
was
going
to
pay
five
dollars
for
his
tea
and
for
that
sum
he
ought
to
least
to
have
it
under
the
conditions
he
preferred
glad
to
meet
you
mr
twist
he
nevertheless
said
as
mr
twist
introduced
himself
his
eyes
however
roving
over
the
ministering
annas
a
roving
mr
twist
noticed
with
fresh
misgivings
it
made
him
sit
down
firmly
at
the
table
and
say
if
you
do
mind
ridding
is
my
name
if
you
do
mind
ridding
i
like
to
explain
our
objects
to
you
but
he
could
help
wondering
what
he
would
do
if
there
were
several
tables
with
guests
at
them
it
being
clear
that
there
would
be
enough
of
him
in
such
a
case
to
go
round
ridding
for
his
part
could
help
wondering
why
the
devil
teapot
twist
sat
down
unasked
at
his
table
five
dollars
come
now
for
that
a
man
had
a
right
to
a
table
to
himself
but
anyhow
the
annas
would
have
stayed
talking
for
at
that
moment
a
car
stopped
in
the
lane
and
quite
a
lot
of
footsteps
were
heard
coming
up
the
neatly
sanded
path
ridding
pricked
up
his
ears
for
from
the
things
he
had
heard
being
said
all
the
evening
before
and
all
that
morning
in
acapulco
besides
most
of
the
night
from
the
lips
of
that
strange
old
lady
with
whom
by
some
dreadful
mistake
he
was
obliged
to
sleep
he
had
supposed
there
would
be
exactly
a
rush
four
young
men
came
in
ridding
did
know
them
no
class
he
thought
looking
them
over
and
was
seized
with
a
feeling
of
sulky
vexation
suitable
to
twenty
when
he
saw
with
what
enthusiasm
the
twinklers
flew
to
meet
them
they
behaved
thought
ridding
crossly
as
if
they
were
the
oldest
and
dearest
friends
who
are
they
he
asked
curtly
of
mr
twist
cutting
into
the
long
things
he
was
saying
only
the
different
experts
who
helped
me
rebuild
the
place
said
mr
twist
a
little
impatiently
he
too
had
pricked
up
his
ears
in
expectation
at
the
sound
of
all
those
feet
and
was
disappointed
he
continued
what
ridding
watching
the
group
of
young
people
called
sulkily
to
himself
his
rigmarole
but
continued
more
abstractedly
he
also
was
watching
the
annas
and
the
experts
the
young
men
were
evidently
in
the
highest
spirits
and
were
walking
round
the
annas
admiring
their
and
expressing
their
admiration
in
laughter
and
exclamations
one
would
have
thought
they
had
known
each
other
all
their
lives
the
twins
were
wreathed
in
smiles
they
looked
as
pleased
mr
twist
thought
as
cats
that
are
being
stroked
almost
he
could
hear
them
purring
he
glanced
helplessly
across
to
where
bilton
sat
as
he
had
told
her
bent
pen
in
hand
over
the
ledger
she
did
move
it
was
true
he
had
told
her
to
sit
like
that
but
had
the
woman
any
imagination
what
she
ought
to
do
now
was
to
bustle
forward
and
take
that
laughing
group
in
charge
as
i
was
telling
you
resumed
mr
twist
returning
with
an
effort
to
ridding
only
to
find
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
young
people
and
catch
an
unmistakably
thwarted
look
in
his
face
in
a
flash
mr
twist
realized
what
he
had
come
for
it
was
solely
to
see
and
talk
to
the
twins
he
must
have
noticed
them
at
the
cosmopolitan
and
come
out
just
for
them
just
for
that
unprincipled
old
scoundrel
said
mr
twist
under
his
breath
his
ears
flaming
aloud
he
said
as
i
was
telling
you
and
went
on
distractedly
with
his
rigmarole
then
some
more
people
came
in
they
had
motored
but
the
noise
the
experts
were
making
had
drowned
the
sound
of
their
arrival
ridding
and
mr
twist
both
occupied
in
glowering
at
the
group
in
the
middle
of
the
room
were
made
aware
of
their
presence
by
suddenly
dropping
the
pencil
and
tablets
she
had
been
provided
with
for
writing
down
orders
and
taking
an
uncertain
and
obviously
timid
step
forward
they
both
looked
round
in
the
direction
of
her
reluctant
step
and
saw
a
man
and
two
women
standing
on
the
threshold
mr
twist
of
course
did
know
them
he
hardly
knew
anybody
even
by
sight
but
ridding
did
that
is
he
knew
them
well
by
sight
and
had
carefully
avoided
knowing
them
any
other
way
for
they
were
germans
ridding
was
one
of
those
who
did
like
germans
he
was
a
man
who
liked
or
disliked
what
his
daily
paper
told
him
to
and
his
daily
paper
was
for
reasons
natural
to
one
who
disliked
germans
and
yet
at
the
same
time
had
a
thirstily
affectionate
disposition
he
declined
to
believe
the
prevailing
theory
about
the
twinklers
besides
he
believe
it
anyhow
at
that
age
people
were
truthful
and
he
had
heard
them
explain
they
had
come
from
england
and
had
acquired
their
rolling
r
during
a
sojourn
abroad
why
should
he
doubt
but
he
refrained
from
declaring
his
belief
in
their
innocence
of
the
unpopular
nationality
owing
to
a
desire
to
avoid
trouble
in
that
bedroom
he
could
call
his
but
was
obliged
so
humiliatingly
to
speak
of
as
ours
except
however
for
the
twinklers
for
all
other
persons
of
whom
it
was
said
that
they
were
germans
naturalized
or
not
immediate
or
remote
he
had
instructed
by
his
newspaper
what
his
called
a
healthy
instinctive
abhorrence
and
she
got
it
too
he
thought
much
gratified
at
this
bond
between
them
as
he
noted
hesitating
and
reluctant
advance
to
meet
the
new
guests
there
proof
that
people
are
wrong
but
what
had
got
was
for
here
were
the
first
strangers
the
first
real
proper
visitors
such
as
any
shop
or
hotel
might
have
ridding
was
a
friend
so
were
the
experts
friends
this
was
trade
coming
in
real
business
being
done
had
supposed
she
would
be
shy
when
the
and
moment
arrived
but
she
was
and
it
was
because
the
guests
seemed
so
disconcertingly
pleased
to
see
her
even
on
the
threshold
the
whole
three
stood
smiling
broadly
at
her
she
had
been
prepared
for
that
and
it
unnerved
her
charming
charming
said
the
newcomers
advancing
towards
her
and
embracing
the
room
and
the
tables
and
the
annas
in
one
immense
inclusive
smile
of
appreciation
know
those
asked
ridding
again
cutting
into
mr
explanations
no
said
he
wangelbeckers
said
ridding
briefly
indeed
said
mr
twist
off
whose
ignorance
the
name
glanced
harmlessly
well
as
i
was
telling
yous
but
this
is
delicious
this
is
a
conception
of
genius
said
wangelbecker
after
he
had
picked
up
tablets
and
restored
them
to
her
with
a
low
bow
charming
charming
said
wangelbecker
looking
round
real
cunning
said
miss
wangelbecker
as
they
say
here
and
she
laughed
at
with
an
air
of
mutual
understanding
will
you
have
tea
or
coffee
asked
nervously
or
perhaps
you
would
prefer
frothed
chocolate
each
of
these
beverages
can
be
delicious
delicious
said
wangelbecker
enveloping
in
her
smile
the
frothed
chocolate
is
very
delicious
said
with
a
kind
of
grave
nervousness
ah
charming
charming
said
wangelbecker
obstinately
appreciative
and
there
as
well
said
her
eyes
on
her
tablets
so
as
to
avoid
seeing
the
wangelbecker
smile
and
and
a
great
many
kinds
of
cakes
well
had
we
better
sit
down
first
said
wangelbecker
genially
or
are
all
the
tables
engaged
oh
i
your
pardon
said
blushing
and
moving
hastily
towards
a
table
laid
for
three
ah
that
better
said
wangelbecker
following
closely
on
her
heels
now
we
can
go
into
the
serious
business
of
ordering
what
we
shall
eat
comfortably
but
before
i
sit
down
allow
me
to
present
myself
my
name
is
wangelbecker
an
honest
german
name
and
this
is
my
wife
she
too
had
an
honest
german
name
before
she
honoured
mine
by
accepting
it
she
was
a
niedermayer
and
this
is
my
daughter
with
whom
i
trust
you
will
soon
be
friends
and
they
all
put
out
their
hands
to
be
shaken
and
shook
them
look
at
that
now
said
ridding
watching
as
i
was
telling
you
said
mr
twist
irritably
for
really
why
should
anna
ii
shake
hands
right
off
with
strangers
her
business
was
to
wait
not
to
get
shaking
hands
he
must
point
out
to
her
very
plainly
pleased
to
meet
you
miss
von
twinkler
said
wangelbecker
and
at
this
was
so
much
startled
that
she
dropped
her
tablets
a
second
time
as
they
say
here
laughed
miss
wangelbecker
again
with
that
air
of
mutual
comprehension
but
they
do
said
anna
felicitas
hurriedly
taking
her
tablets
from
the
restoring
hand
of
wangelbecker
and
forgetting
to
thank
him
what
said
wangelbecker
when
you
are
both
so
charming
that
for
once
the
phrase
must
be
sincere
miss
von
twinkler
means
she
finds
it
wiser
not
to
use
her
title
said
wangelbecker
well
perhaps
perhaps
wiser
perhaps
from
the
point
of
view
of
convenience
is
that
where
you
will
sit
güstchen
still
we
germans
when
we
are
together
can
allow
ourselves
the
refreshment
of
being
ourselves
and
i
hope
to
be
frequently
the
means
of
giving
you
the
relief
you
and
your
charming
sister
of
hearing
yourselves
addressed
correctly
it
is
a
great
family
the
von
twinklers
a
great
family
in
these
sad
days
we
germans
must
hang
together
stood
tablets
in
hand
looking
helplessly
from
one
wangelbecker
to
the
other
the
situation
was
beyond
her
but
she
began
then
stopped
shall
i
bring
you
tea
or
coffee
she
ended
by
asking
again
well
now
this
is
amusing
said
wangelbecker
sitting
down
comfortably
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
table
is
it
güstchen
to
see
a
von
twinkler
playing
at
waiting
on
us
charming
charming
said
his
wife
it
real
sporting
said
his
daughter
laughing
up
at
again
with
comprehension
with
almost
a
wink
you
must
let
me
come
and
help
i
look
nice
in
that
costume
would
i
mother
there
is
also
frothed
choc
i
suppose
now
mr
twist
he
must
be
completely
sympathy
interrupted
wangelbecker
confidentially
leaning
forward
and
lowering
his
voice
a
little
gazed
at
him
blankly
some
more
people
were
coming
in
at
the
door
and
behind
them
she
could
see
on
the
path
yet
more
and
was
in
the
pantry
fetching
the
tea
for
the
experts
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
i
am
to
bring
you
she
asked
because
i
afraid
wangelbecker
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
she
was
looking
ah
he
said
getting
up
but
this
is
magnificent
güstchen
here

kleinbart
and
her
sister
why
and
there
come
the
diederichs
but
splendid
splendid
say
said
ridding
turning
to
mr
twist
with
a
congested
face
ever
been
to
berlin
no
said
mr
twist
annoyed
by
a
question
of
such
wanton
irrelevance
flung
into
the
middle
of
his
sentence
well
it
just
like
this
like
this
repeated
mr
twist
those
there
said
ridding
jerking
his
head
that
lot
there
see
any
day
in
berlin
or
frankfurt
or
any
other
of
their
confounded
towns
i
do
follow
said
mr
twist
very
shortly
indeed
germans
said
ridding
germans
all
germans
said
ridding
all
germans
wangelbeckers
are
germans
said
ridding
did
you
know
no
said
mr
twist
so
are
the
ones
who
just
come
in
germans
all
germans
so
are
those
behind
just
coming
in
germans
all
germans
there
was
a
pause
during
which
mr
twist
stared
round
the
room
it
was
presenting
quite
a
populous
appearance
then
he
said
slowly
well
damned
and
ridding
for
the
first
time
looked
pleased
with
mr
twist
he
considered
that
at
last
he
was
talking
sense
mr
twist
he
said
heartily
i
exceedingly
glad
you
damned
it
was
what
i
was
sure
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
you
would
be

sir
chapter
xxxii
that
evening
depression
reigned
in
the
open
arms
mr
twist
paced
up
and
down
the
deep
in
thought
that
was
obviously
unpleasant
and
perplexed
bilton
went
to
bed
abruptly
after
a
short
outpour
of
words
to
the
effect
that
she
had
never
seen
so
many
germans
at
once
before
that
her
psyche
was
disharmonious
to
germans
that
they
made
her
go
just
as
cats
in
a
room
made
bilton
go
in
the
days
when
he
had
flesh
to
go
it
with
that
she
had
been
aware
the
inn
was
to
be
a
popular
resort
and
rendezvous
for
germans
and
that
she
wished
to
speak
alone
with
mr
twist
in
the
morning
while
the
twins
feeling
the
ominousness
of
this
last
sentence
as
did
mr
twist
who
started
when
he
heard
it
and
overcome
by
the
lassitude
that
had
succeeded
the
shocks
of
the
afternoon
a
lassitude
much
increased
by
their
having
tried
to
finish
up
the
pailsful
of
ices
and
the
huge
piles
of
cakes
slowly
soddening
in
their
own
souring
cream
went
out
together
on
to
the
moonlit
verandah
and
stood
looking
up
in
silence
at
the
stars
there
they
stood
in
silence
and
thought
things
about
the
immense
distance
and
indifference
of
those
bright
cold
specks
and
how
infinitely
insignificant
after
all
they
the
twinklers
were
and
how
they
would
both
in
any
case
be
dead
in
a
hundred
years
and
this
last
reflection
afforded
them
somehow
a
kind
of
bleak
and
draughty
comfort
thus
the
first
evening
that
was
to
have
been
so
happy
was
spent
by
everybody
in
silence
and
apart
li
koo
felt
the
atmosphere
of
oppression
even
in
his
kitchen
and
refrained
from
song
he
put
away
after
dealing
with
it
cunningly
so
that
it
should
keep
until
a
more
propitious
hour
a
wonderful
drink
he
had
prepared
for
supper
in
celebration
of
the
opening
day
me
make
celebrity
he
had
said
squeezing
together
strange
essences
and
fruits
and
he
moved
softly
about
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
meditations
of
the
master
li
koo
was
perfectly
aware
of
what
had
gone
wrong
it
was
the
unexpected
arrival
to
tea
of
germans
being
a
member
of
the
least
of
the
nations
he
viewed
germans
with
peculiar
disfavour
and
understood
his
master
prolonged
walking
up
and
down
also
he
had
noted
through
a
crack
in
the
door
the
way
these
people
of
blood
and
death
crowded
round
the
girls
and
was
not
that
sufficient
in
itself
to
cause
his
master
numerous
and
rapid
steps
numerous
indeed
that
evening
were
mr
twist
steps
he
felt
he
must
think
and
he
could
think
better
walking
up
and
down
why
had
all
those
germans
come
why
except
old
ridding
and
the
experts
had
none
of
the
americans
come
it
was
very
strange
and
what
germans
so
cordial
so
exuberant
to
the
twins
so
openly
gathering
them
to
their
bosoms
as
though
they
belonged
there
and
so
cordial
too
to
him
approaching
him
in
spite
of
his
withdrawals
conveying
to
him
somehow
his
disagreeable
impression
had
been
that
he
and
they
perfectly
understood
each
other
then
bilton
was
she
going
to
give
trouble
it
looked
like
it
it
looked
amazingly
like
it
was
she
after
all
just
another
edition
of
his
mother
and
unable
to
discriminate
between
germans
and
germans
between
the
real
thing
and
mere
technicalities
like
the
twinklers
it
is
true
he
had
told
her
the
twins
were
german
but
then
neither
had
he
told
her
they
were
he
had
been
passive
in
bilton
presence
passivity
came
instinctively
anything
else
involved
such
extreme
and
unusual
exertion
he
had
never
had
the
least
objection
to
her
discovering
their
nationality
for
herself
and
indeed
had
been
surprised
she
had
done
so
long
ago
for
he
felt
sure
she
would
quickly
begin
to
love
the
annas
and
once
she
loved
them
she
would
mind
what
their
father
had
happened
to
be
he
had
supposed
she
did
love
them
how
affectionately
she
had
kissed
them
that
very
afternoon
and
wished
them
luck
was
all
that
nothing
was
lovableness
nothing
and
complete
innocence
after
all
in
the
matter
of
being
born
when
weighed
against
the
one
fact
of
the
von
what
he
would
do
if
bilton
left
him
he
could
imagine
what
would
happen
to
the
open
arms
and
the
twins
in
such
a
case
his
worried
brain
simply
could
conceive
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
every
time
he
passed
the
open
door
on
to
the
verandah
he
could
see
the
two
annas
standing
motionless
on
its
edge
their
faces
as
they
gazed
at
the
stars
white
in
the
moonlight
and
very
serious
pathetic
children
pathetic
solitary
alien
children
what
were
they
thinking
of
he
would
mind
betting
it
was
their
mother
mr
twist
heart
gave
a
kind
of
tug
at
him
his
sentimental
maternal
side
heaved
to
the
top
a
great
impulse
to
hurry
out
and
put
his
arms
round
them
seized
him
but
he
frowned
and
overcame
it
he
did
want
to
go
soft
now
nor
was
this
the
moment
his
nicely
brought
up
soul
told
him
his
soul
still
echoing
with
the
voice
of
clark
to
put
his
arms
round
them
this
the
very
first
occasion
on
which
bilton
had
left
them
alone
with
him
whether
it
would
become
proper
on
the
very
second
occasion
was
one
of
those
questions
that
would
instantly
have
suggested
itself
to
the
annas
themselves
but
did
occur
to
mr
twist
he
merely
went
on
to
think
of
another
reason
against
it
which
was
the
chance
of
bilton
looking
out
of
her
window
just
as
he
did
it
she
might
he
felt
easily
misjudge
the
situation
and
the
situation
he
felt
was
difficult
enough
already
so
he
restrained
himself
and
the
annas
continued
to
consider
infinite
space
and
to
perceive
again
with
that
feeling
of
dank
and
unsatisfactory
consolation
that
nothing
really
mattered
next
day
immediately
after
breakfast
bilton
followed
him
into
his
office
and
gave
notice
she
called
it
formally
tendering
her
resignation
she
said
that
all
her
life
she
had
been
an
upholder
of
straight
dealing
as
much
in
herself
towards
others
as
in
others
towards
herself
bilton
interrupted
mr
twist
only
it
did
interrupt
she
had
also
all
her
life
been
intensely
patriotic
and
mr
twist
she
feared
did
look
at
patriotism
with
quite
her
single
eye
bilton
as
her
eye
saw
it
patriotism
was
among
other
things
a
determination
to
resist
the
encroachments
of
foreigners
bilton
she
had
no
wish
to
judge
him
but
she
had
still
less
wish
to
be
mixed
up
with
foreigners
and
foreigners
for
her
at
that
moment
meant
germans
bilton
she
regretted
but
psychically
she
would
never
be
able
to
flourish
in
a
soil
so
largely
composed
as
the
soil
of
the
open
arms
appeared
to
be
of
that
nationality
bilton
and
though
it
was
none
of
her
business
still
she
must
say
it
did
seem
to
her
a
pity
that
mr
twist
with
his
and
respected
american
name
should
be
mixed
up
bilton
and
though
she
had
no
wish
to
be
inquisitive
still
she
must
say
it
did
seem
to
her
peculiar
that
mr
twist
should
be
the
guardian
of
two
girls
who
it
was
clear
from
what
she
had
overheard
that
afternoon
were
german
here
mr
twist
raised
his
voice
and
shouted
bilton
he
shouted
so
loud
that
she
could
but
stop
if
you
guarantee
to
keep
quiet
for
just
five
minutes
sit
down
right
here
at
this
table
and
not
say
one
single
thing
not
one
single
thing
for
just
five
minutes
he
said
banging
the
table
i
tell
you
all
about
it
oh
yes
i
accept
your
resignation
at
the
end
of
that
time
if
you
still
set
on
leaving
but
just
for
this
once
it
me
that
going
to
do
the
talking
and
this
must
be
imagined
as
said
so
loud
that
only
capital
letters
would
properly
represent
the
noise
mr
twist
made
bilton
did
sit
down
her
face
flushed
by
the
knowledge
of
how
good
her
intentions
had
been
when
she
took
the
post
and
how
deceitful
she
was
forced
to
think
it
mr
twist
were
when
he
offered
it
she
was
prepared
however
to
give
him
a
hearing
it
was
only
fair
but
mr
twist
had
to
burst
into
capitals
several
times
before
he
had
done
so
difficult
was
it
for
bilton
even
when
she
had
agreed
even
when
she
herself
wished
not
to
say
anything
it
was
five
minutes
but
twenty
before
bilton
came
out
of
the
office
again
she
went
straight
into
the
garden
where
the
annas
aware
of
the
interview
going
on
with
mr
twist
had
been
lingering
anxiously
unable
at
so
crucial
a
moment
to
settle
to
anything
and
with
solemnity
kissed
them
her
eyes
were
very
bright
her
face
ordinarily
colourless
as
parchment
was
red
positively
she
kissed
them
without
saying
a
single
word
and
they
kissed
her
back
with
such
enthusiasm
with
a
relief
that
made
them
hug
her
so
tight
and
cling
to
her
so
close
that
the
brightness
in
her
eyes
brimmed
over
and
she
had
to
get
out
her
handkerchief
and
wipe
it
away
gurls
said
bilton
i
had
a
shock
yesterday
but
i
through
with
it
you
motherless
i
daughterless
we
weld
and
with
this
unusual
brevity
did
bilton
sum
up
the
situation
she
was
much
moved
her
heart
was
touched
and
once
that
happened
nothing
could
exceed
her
capacity
for
sticking
through
what
she
called
thick
and
thin
to
her
guns
for
years
bilton
had
occupied
the
position
of
the
guns
now
it
would
be
these
poor
orphans
no
germans
could
frighten
her
away
once
she
knew
their
story
no
harsh
judgments
and
misconceptions
of
her
patriotic
friends
mr
twist
had
told
her
everything
from
the
beginning
on
the
harking
back
to
uncle
arthur
and
the
attitude
of
england
describing
what
he
knew
of
their
mother
and
her
death
not
even
concealing
the
part
his
own
mother
had
played
or
that
he
was
their
guardian
at
all
he
made
the
most
of
bilton
silence
and
as
she
listened
her
heart
melted
within
her
and
the
immense
store
of
grit
which
was
her
peculiar
pride
came
to
the
top
and
once
and
for
all
overwhelmed
her
prejudices
but
she
could
think
and
at
last
she
burst
out
and
told
mr
twist
she
could
think
why
he
had
imparted
all
this
to
her
long
ago
ah
murmured
mr
twist
bowing
his
head
as
a
reed
in
the
wind
before
the
outburst
of
her
released
volubility
hope
once
more
filled
the
open
arms
and
the
twist
party
looked
forward
to
the
afternoon
with
renewed
cheerfulness
it
had
just
happened
so
the
first
day
that
only
germans
came
it
was
just
accident
mr
twist
with
the
very
large
part
of
him
that
was
his
head
found
himself
feeling
like
this
too
and
declining
to
take
any
notice
of
his
intelligence
which
continued
to
try
to
worry
him
yet
the
hope
they
all
felt
was
not
realized
and
the
second
afternoon
was
almost
exactly
like
the
first
germans
came
and
clustered
round
the
annas
and
made
friendly
though
cautious
advances
to
mr
twist
the
ones
who
had
been
there
the
first
day
came
again
and
brought
others
with
them
worse
than
themselves
and
they
seemed
more
at
home
than
ever
and
the
air
was
full
of
rolling
r
among
them
mr
twist
was
unable
to
deny
being
the
r
of
his
blessed
annas
but
theirs
were
such
little
r
he
told
himself
they
rolled
it
is
true
but
with
how
sweet
a
rolling
while
as
for
these
other
people
confound
it
all
the
place
might
really
have
been
from
the
sounds
that
were
filling
it
a
unter
den
linden
all
his
doubts
and
anxieties
flocked
back
on
him
as
time
passed
and
no
americans
appeared
americans
how
precious
how
clean
and
straight
and
admirable
actually
he
had
sometimes
he
remembered
thought
they
were
what
an
aberration
actually
he
had
been
he
remembered
impatient
with
them
when
first
he
came
back
from
france
what
folly
americans
the
very
word
was
refreshing
was
like
clear
water
on
a
thirsty
day
one
american
even
one
coming
in
that
afternoon
would
have
seemed
to
mr
twist
a
godsend
a
purifier
an
emollient
like
some
blessed
unction
dropped
from
above
but
none
appeared
not
even
ridding
at
six
it
was
quite
dark
and
obviously
too
late
to
go
on
hoping
the
days
in
california
end
abruptly
the
sun
goes
down
and
close
on
its
heels
comes
night
in
the
the
charmingly
shaded
lights
had
been
turned
on
some
time
and
mr
twist
watching
from
the
partly
open
door
of
his
office
waited
impatiently
for
the
guests
to
begin
to
thin
out
but
they
did
they
took
no
notice
of
the
signals
of
lateness
the
lights
turned
on
the
stars
outside
growing
bright
in
the
surrounding
blackness
mr
twist
watched
angrily
he
had
been
driven
into
his
office
by
the
disconcerting
and
incomprehensible
overtures
of
wangelbecker
and
had
sat
there
watching
in
growing
exasperation
ever
since
when
six
struck
and
nobody
showed
the
least
sign
of
going
away
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
touched
the
little
muffled
electric
bell
that
connected
him
to
bilton
in
what
called
a
mystical
union
anna
ii
was
really
excessively
tactless
she
had
said
this
to
bilton
in
his
presence
and
then
enlarged
on
unions
mystical
and
otherwise
with
an
embarrassing
abundance
of
imagery
by
buzzing
gently
against
her
knee
from
the
leg
of
the
desk
she
laid
down
her
pen
as
though
she
had
just
finished
adding
up
a
column
and
went
to
him
now
do
talk
said
mr
twist
putting
up
an
irritable
hand
directly
she
came
in
bilton
looked
at
him
in
much
surprise
talk
mr
twist
she
repeated
why
now
as
though
do
i
say
bilton
but
listen
listen
now
i
ca
stand
seeing
those
children
in
there
it
sheer
makes
my
gorge
rise
i
want
you
to
fetch
them
in
here
now
do
talk
you
and
me
do
the
confounded
waiting
no
no
do
talk
they
to
stay
quiet
in
here
till
the
last
of
those
germans
have
gone
just
go
and
fetch
them
please
bilton
no
no
we
talk
afterwards
i
stay
here
till
they
come
and
he
urged
her
out
into
the
again
the
guests
had
finished
their
tea
long
ago
but
still
sat
on
for
they
were
very
comfortable
obviously
they
were
thoroughly
enjoying
themselves
and
all
were
growing
as
time
passed
more
manifestly
at
home
they
were
now
having
a
kind
of
supper
of
ices
and
five
dollars
thought
the
sensible
germans
was
after
all
a
great
deal
to
pay
for
afternoon
tea
however
good
the
cause
might
be
and
however
important
one
own
ulterior
motives
and
since
one
had
in
any
case
to
pay
one
should
eat
what
one
could
so
they
kept
the
annas
very
busy
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
thought
the
annas
as
they
ran
hither
and
thither
to
what
a
german
will
hold
bilton
waylaid
the
heated
and
harried
as
she
was
carrying
a
tray
of
ices
to
a
party
she
felt
she
had
been
carrying
ices
to
innumerable
times
already
the
little
curls
beneath
her
cap
clung
damply
to
her
forehead
her
face
was
flushed
and
distressed
what
with
having
to
carry
so
many
trays
and
remember
so
many
orders
and
try
at
the
same
time
to
escape
from
the
orderers
and
their
questions
and
admiration
she
was
in
a
condition
not
very
far
from
tears
bilton
took
the
tray
out
of
her
hands
and
told
her
mr
twist
wanted
to
speak
to
her
and
was
in
such
a
general
bewilderment
that
she
felt
quite
scared
and
thought
he
must
be
going
to
scold
her
she
went
towards
the
office
reluctantly
if
mr
twist
were
to
be
severe
she
was
sure
she
would
be
able
not
to
cry
she
made
her
way
very
slowly
to
the
office
and
bilton
looked
round
the
room
for
the
other
one
there
was
no
sign
of
her
perhaps
thought
bilton
she
was
fetching
something
in
the
kitchen
and
would
appear
in
a
minute
and
seeing
a
group
over
by
the
entrance
door
for
whom
the
tray
she
held
was
evidently
destined
gesticulating
to
her
she
felt
she
had
better
keep
them
quiet
first
and
then
go
and
look
for
bilton
set
her
teeth
and
plunged
into
her
strange
new
duties
never
would
she
have
dreamed
it
possible
that
she
should
have
to
carry
trays
to
germans
if
bilton
could
see
her
now
he
would
certainly
turn
in
his
grave
well
she
was
a
woman
of
grit
of
adhesiveness
to
her
guns
if
bilton
did
see
her
and
did
turn
in
his
grave
let
him
he
would
she
dared
say
be
more
comfortable
on
his
other
side
after
all
these
years
for
the
next
few
minutes
she
hurried
hither
and
thither
and
waited
she
seemed
to
be
swallowed
up
in
activity
no
wonder
that
child
had
looked
so
hot
and
bewildered
mr
twist
did
come
and
help
as
he
had
promised
and
nowhere
was
there
any
sign
of
and
the
guests
not
only
wanted
things
to
eat
they
wanted
to
talk
talk
and
ask
questions
well
she
would
wait
on
them
but
she
would
talk
she
turned
a
dry
face
to
their
conversational
blandishments
and
responded
only
by
adding
up
their
bills
wonderful
are
the
workings
of
patriotism
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
bilton
was
grumbled
at
for
not
talking
chapter
xxxiii
in
the
office
found
mr
twist
walking
up
and
down
see
here
he
said
turning
on
her
when
she
came
in
i
about
tired
of
looking
on
at
all
this
twittering
round
that
lot
in
there
through
with
that
for
and
maybe
for
and
the
day
after
as
well
he
waved
his
arm
at
the
deep
chair
that
had
been
provided
for
his
business
meditations
you
sit
down
in
that
chair
now
he
said
severely
and
stay
put
looked
at
him
with
a
quivering
lip
she
went
rather
unsteadily
to
the
chair
and
tumbled
into
it
i
do
know
if
you
angry
or
being
kind
she
said
tremulously
but
whichever
it
is
i
i
wish
you
would
i
i
wish
you
manage
to
be
something
that
is
either
and
as
she
had
feared
she
began
to
cry
said
mr
twist
staring
down
at
her
in
concern
mixed
with
irritation
out
there
all
those
germans
in
here
the
weeping
child
what
a
day
he
was
having
for
heaven
sake
do
do
that
i
know
sobbed
i
do
want
to
it
awful
being
so
natu
natu
naturally
liquid
but
what
the
matter
asked
mr
twist
helplessly
nothing
sobbed
he
stood
over
her
in
silence
for
a
minute
his
hands
in
his
pockets
if
he
took
them
out
he
was
afraid
he
might
start
stroking
her
and
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
exactly
between
the
ages
when
such
a
form
of
comfort
would
be
legitimate
if
she
were
younger
but
she
was
a
great
girl
now
if
she
were
older
ah
if
she
were
older
mr
twist
could
imagine
you
overtired
he
said
aloofly
that
what
you
are
no
sobbed
and
the
germans
have
been
too
much
for
you
they
have
sobbed
her
pride
up
at
the
suggestion
that
anybody
could
ever
be
that
but
they
not
going
to
get
the
chance
again
said
mr
twist
setting
his
teeth
as
much
as
they
would
set
which
was
owing
to
his
natural
kindliness
anything
particular
bilton
and
me
then
he
remembered
why
does
she
come
he
asked
who
choked
the
other
one
anna
ii
columbus
i
have
seen
her
for
ages
sobbed
who
had
been
much
upset
by
prolonged
disappearance
and
had
suspected
her
though
she
could
understand
it
after
last
night
finishings
up
of
secret
unworthy
conduct
in
a
corner
with
mr
twist
went
to
the
door
quickly
and
looked
through
i
ca
see
her
either
he
said
confound
them
what
have
they
done
to
her
worn
her
out
too
i
daresay
i
should
wonder
if
she
crawled
off
somewhere
and
were
crying
too
does
crawl
sobbed
and
she
does
cry
but
i
wish
you
find
her
well
will
you
stay
where
you
are
while
i
away
then
he
said
looking
at
her
from
the
door
uncertainly
and
she
seemed
so
extra
small
over
there
in
the
enormous
chair
and
somehow
so
extra
motherless
as
she
obediently
gurgled
and
choked
a
promise
not
to
move
that
he
found
himself
unable
to
resist
going
back
to
her
for
a
minute
in
order
to
pat
her
head
there
there
said
mr
twist
very
gently
patting
her
head
his
heart
yearning
over
her
and
it
yearned
the
more
that
the
minute
he
patted
her
sobs
got
worse
and
also
the
more
because
of
the
feel
of
her
dear
little
head
you
little
bit
of
blessedness
murmured
mr
twist
before
he
knew
what
he
was
saying
at
which
her
sobs
grew
louder
than
ever
grew
indeed
almost
into
small
howls
so
long
was
it
since
anybody
had
said
things
like
that
to
her
it
was
her
mother
who
used
to
say
things
like
that
things
almost
exactly
like
that
hush
said
mr
twist
in
much
distress
and
with
one
anxious
eye
on
the
door
for
sobs
were
threatening
to
outdo
the
noise
of
teacups
and
plates
hush
hush
here
a
clean
handkerchief
you
just
wipe
up
your
eyes
while
i
fetch
anna
ii
worry
you
know
if
she
sees
you
like
this
hush
now
hush
there
there
and
i
expect
she
being
miserable
enough
already
hiding
away
in
some
corner
you
would
like
to
make
her
more
miserable
would
you
and
he
pressed
the
handkerchief
into
hands
and
feeling
much
flurried
went
away
to
search
for
the
other
one
who
was
somewhere
he
was
sure
in
a
state
of
equal
distress
he
had
however
to
search
he
found
her
immediately
as
he
came
out
of
the
door
of
his
office
into
the
he
saw
her
come
into
the
from
the
door
of
the
verandah
and
proceed
across
it
towards
the
pantry
why
the
verandah
wondered
mr
twist
he
hurried
to
intercept
her
anyhow
she
was
either
about
to
cry
or
getting
over
having
done
it
he
saw
that
at
once
with
relief
nor
was
she
it
would
seem
in
any
sort
of
distress
on
the
contrary
looked
particularly
smug
he
saw
that
once
too
with
surprise
why
smug
wondered
mr
twist
she
had
a
pleased
look
of
complete
satisfaction
on
her
face
she
was
oblivious
he
noticed
as
she
passed
between
the
tables
of
the
guests
who
tried
in
vain
to
attract
her
attention
and
detain
her
with
orders
she
was
at
all
hot
as
had
been
nor
rattled
nor
in
any
way
discomposed
she
was
just
smug
and
also
she
was
unusually
extraordinarily
pretty
how
dared
they
all
stare
up
at
her
like
that
as
she
passed
and
try
to
stop
her
and
want
to
talk
to
her
and
wangelbecker
actually
laying
his
hand
no
his
paw
in
his
annoyance
mr
twist
would
admit
that
the
object
at
the
end
of
wangelbecker
arm
was
anything
but
a
paw
on
her
wrist
to
get
her
to
listen
to
some
confounded
order
or
other
she
took
no
notice
of
that
either
but
walked
on
towards
the
pantry
placidly
steadily
obvious
smug
you
to
come
into
the
office
said
mr
twist
when
he
reached
her
she
turned
her
head
and
considered
him
with
abstracted
eyes
then
she
appeared
to
remember
him
oh
it
you
she
said
amiably
yes
it
me
all
right
and
you
to
come
into
the
office
i
ca
i
busy
now
anna
said
mr
twist
walking
beside
her
towards
the
pantry
since
she
did
stop
but
continued
steadily
on
her
way
trifling
with
the
facts
you
been
in
the
garden
i
saw
you
come
in
perhaps
you
tell
me
the
exact
line
of
business
you
been
engaged
in
waiting
said
placidly
waiting
in
the
garden
where
it
pitch
dark
and
there
nobody
to
wait
on
they
had
reached
the
pantry
and
gave
an
order
to
li
koo
through
the
serving
window
before
answering
the
order
was
tea
and
hot
cinnamon
toast
for
one
he
having
his
tea
on
the
verandah
she
said
picking
out
the
most
delicious
of
the
little
cakes
from
the
trays
standing
ready
and
carefully
arranging
them
on
a
dish
it
is
pitch
dark
at
all
there
there
floods
of
light
coming
through
the
windows
he
wo
come
in
and
why
pray
wo
he
come
in
asked
mr
twist
because
he
does
like
germans
and
who
pray
is
he
i
do
know
well
i
do
burst
out
mr
twist
it
old
ridding
of
course
his
name
is
ridding
the
old
man
who
was
here
yesterday
now
listen
i
have
but
was
laughing
and
her
eyes
had
disappeared
into
two
funny
little
eyelashy
slits
mr
twist
stopped
abruptly
and
glared
at
her
these
twinklers
that
one
in
there
shaken
with
sobs
this
one
in
here
shaken
with
what
she
would
no
doubt
call
quite
the
contrary
his
conviction
became
suddenly
final
that
the
office
was
the
place
for
both
the
annas
he
and
bilton
would
do
the
waiting
i
take
this
he
said
laying
hold
of
the
dish
of
cakes
i
send
bilton
for
the
tea
go
into
the
office
your
sister
is
there
and
wants
you
badly
i
do
know
he
added
as
li
koo
pushed
the
through
the
serving
window
how
it
strikes
you
about
laughter
but
it
strikes
me
as
sheer
silly
to
laugh
except
at
something
well
i
was
said
unscrewing
her
eyes
and
with
gentle
firmness
taking
the
plate
of
cakes
from
him
and
putting
it
on
the
tray
i
was
laughing
at
your
swift
conviction
that
the
man
out
there
is
ridding
i
do
know
who
he
is
but
i
know
heaps
of
people
he
is
and
one
of
the
principal
ones
is
mr
ridding
i
going
to
wait
on
him
said
mr
twist
taking
the
tray
it
would
be
most
unsuitable
said
taking
it
too
let
go
said
mr
twist
pulling
is
this
to
be
an
unseemly
wrangle
inquired
mildly
and
her
eyes
began
to
screw
up
again
if
you
oblige
me
by
going
into
the
office
he
said
having
got
the
tray
for
was
never
one
to
struggle
bilton
and
me
will
do
the
rest
of
the
waiting
for
he
went
out
grasping
the
tray
and
made
for
the
verandah
his
appearance
in
this
new
rôle
was
greeted
by
the
germans
with
subdued
applause
subdued
because
they
felt
mr
twist
was
quite
as
cordial
to
them
as
they
had
supposed
he
would
be
and
they
were
accordingly
being
a
little
more
cautious
in
their
methods
with
him
than
they
had
been
at
the
beginning
of
the
afternoon
he
took
no
notice
of
them
except
that
his
ears
turned
red
when
he
knocked
against
a
chair
and
the
tray
nearly
fell
out
of
his
hands
and
they
all
cried
out
damn
them
thought
mr
twist
indeed
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
otherwise
empty
and
very
chilly
verandah
sitting
alone
and
staring
out
at
the
stars
was
a
man
he
was
a
young
man
he
was
also
an
attractive
young
man
with
a
thin
brown
face
and
very
bright
blue
twinkling
eyes
the
light
from
the
window
behind
him
shone
on
him
as
he
turned
his
head
when
he
heard
the
swing
doors
open
and
mr
twist
saw
these
things
distinctly
and
at
once
he
also
saw
how
the
young
man
face
fell
on
his
mr
twist
appearance
with
the
tray
and
he
also
saw
with
some
surprise
how
before
he
had
reached
him
it
suddenly
cleared
again
and
the
young
man
got
up
too
just
as
mr
twist
arrived
at
the
table
got
up
with
some
little
difficulty
for
he
had
to
lean
hard
on
a
thick
stick
but
yet
obviously
with
you
forgotten
the
sugar
said
gentle
voice
behind
mr
twist
as
he
was
putting
down
the
tray
and
there
she
was
sure
enough
looking
smugger
than
ever
this
is
mr
twist
said
with
an
amiable
gesture
that
i
was
telling
you
about
she
explained
to
the
young
man
when
asked
mr
twist
surprised
before
said
we
were
talking
for
some
time
before
i
went
in
to
order
the
tea
were
we
she
said
to
the
young
man
angelically
smiling
at
him
rather
he
said
and
since
he
did
on
this
introduction
remark
to
mr
twist
that
he
was
pleased
to
meet
him
it
was
plain
he
could
be
an
american
therefore
he
must
be
english
unless
suddenly
suspected
mr
twist
who
had
germans
badly
on
his
nerves
that
day
and
was
ready
to
suspect
anything
he
was
german
cleverly
got
up
for
evil
purposes
to
appear
english
but
the
young
man
dispersed
these
suspicions
by
saying
that
he
was
over
from
england
on
six
months
leave
and
that
his
name
was
elliott
like
us
said
the
young
man
looked
at
her
with
what
would
have
been
a
greater
interest
than
ever
if
a
greater
interest
had
been
possible
only
it
was
what
are
you
an
elliott
too
he
asked
eagerly
shook
her
head
on
the
contrary
she
said
i
a
twinkler
and
so
is
my
sister
what
i
meant
was
you
like
us
about
coming
from
england
we
done
that
only
our
leave
is
for
ever
and
ever
or
the
duration
of
the
war
mr
twist
waved
her
aside
he
said
your
sister
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
office
and
wants
you
badly
i
see
to
mr
elliott
why
not
bring
your
sister
here
said
the
young
man
who
being
in
the
navy
was
fertile
in
resourcefulness
and
he
smiled
at
who
smiled
back
indeed
they
did
nothing
but
smile
at
each
other
i
think
that
a
brilliant
idea
she
said
and
turned
to
mr
twist
you
go
she
said
gently
thereby
proving
herself
the
young
man
considered
at
least
his
equal
in
resourcefulness
it
much
more
likely
she
continued
as
mr
twist
gazed
at
her
without
moving
that
she
come
for
you
than
for
me
my
sister
she
explained
to
the
young
man
is
older
than
i
am
then
certainly
i
should
say
mr
twist
is
more
likely
but
only
about
twenty
minutes
older
what
a
twin
i
say
how
extraordinarily
jolly
two
of
you
interrupted
mr
twist
you
will
go
to
your
sister
immediately
she
needs
you
she
upset
i
do
wish
to
draw
elliott
behind
the
scenes
of
family
life
but
as
nothing
seems
to
get
you
into
the
office
you
force
me
to
tell
you
that
she
is
very
much
upset
indeed
and
is
crying
crying
echoed
christopher
and
she
turned
and
departed
in
such
haste
that
the
young
man
who
luckily
was
alert
as
well
as
resourceful
had
only
just
time
to
lean
over
and
grab
at
a
chair
in
her
way
and
pull
it
aside
and
so
avert
a
deplorable
catastrophe
i
hope
it
nothing
serious
he
inquired
of
mr
twist
oh
no
children
will
cry
children
mr
twist
sat
down
at
the
table
and
lit
a
cigarette
tell
me
about
england
he
said
you
been
wounded
i
see
leg
said
the
young
man
still
standing
leaning
on
his
stick
and
looking
after
but
that
did
get
you
six
months
leave
lungs
said
the
young
man
looking
down
impatiently
at
mr
twist
then
the
swing
doors
swung
to
and
he
sat
down
and
poured
out
his
tea
he
had
been
in
the
battle
of
jutland
and
was
rescued
after
hours
in
the
water
for
months
he
was
struggling
to
recover
but
finally
tuberculosis
had
developed
and
he
was
sent
to
california
to
his
sister
who
had
married
an
american
and
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
acapulco
this
mr
twist
extracted
out
of
him
by
diligent
questioning
he
had
to
question
very
diligently
what
the
young
man
wanted
to
talk
about
was
but
every
time
he
tried
to
mr
twist
headed
him
off
and
she
did
come
back
he
waited
and
waited
and
drank
and
drank
when
the
teapot
was
empty
he
started
on
the
hot
water
also
he
ate
all
the
cakes
more
and
more
deliberately
eking
them
out
at
last
with
slowly
smoked
cigarettes
he
heard
all
about
france
and
mr
activities
there
he
had
time
to
listen
to
the
whole
story
of
the
ambulance
from
start
to
finish
and
still
she
did
come
back
in
vain
he
tried
at
least
to
get
mr
twist
off
those
distant
fields
nearer
home
to
the
point
in
fact
where
the
twinklers
were
mr
twist
would
budge
he
stuck
firmly
and
the
swing
doors
remained
shut
and
the
cakes
were
all
eaten
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
at
last
but
to
go
so
after
of
solid
sitting
he
began
slowly
to
get
up
still
spreading
out
the
moments
with
one
eye
on
the
swing
doors
it
was
both
late
and
cold
the
germans
had
departed
and
li
koo
had
lit
the
usual
evening
wood
fire
in
the
big
fireplace
it
blazed
most
beautifully
and
the
young
man
looked
at
it
through
the
window
and
hesitated
how
jolly
he
said
firelight
is
very
pleasant
agreed
mr
twist
who
had
got
up
too
i
ought
to
have
stayed
so
long
out
here
said
the
young
man
with
a
little
shiver
i
was
thinking
it
was
unwise
said
mr
twist
perhaps
i
better
go
in
and
warm
myself
a
bit
before
leaving
i
should
say
your
best
plan
is
to
get
back
quickly
to
your
sister
and
have
a
hot
bath
before
dinner
said
mr
twist
yes
but
i
think
i
might
just
go
in
there
and
have
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
first
there
is
no
hot
coffee
at
this
hour
said
mr
twist
looking
at
his
watch
we
close
at
six
and
it
is
now
ten
minutes
after
then
there
seems
nothing
for
it
but
to
pay
my
bill
and
go
said
the
young
man
with
an
air
of
cheerful
adaptation
to
what
could
be
helped
i
just
nip
in
there
and
do
that
luckily
there
no
need
for
you
to
nip
anywhere
said
mr
twist
for
surely
that
a
type
of
movement
unsuited
to
your
sick
leg
you
can
pay
me
right
here
and
he
took
the
young
man
five
dollars
and
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
green
gate
and
would
have
helped
him
into
the
waiting
car
seeing
his
leg
was
as
other
legs
and
mr
twist
was
after
all
humane
but
the
chauffeur
was
there
to
do
that
so
he
just
watched
from
the
gate
till
the
car
had
actually
started
and
then
went
back
to
the
house
he
went
back
slowly
perturbed
and
anxious
his
eyes
on
the
ground
this
second
day
had
been
worse
than
the
first
and
besides
the
continued
and
remarkable
absence
of
americans
and
the
continued
and
remarkable
presence
of
germans
there
was
a
slipperiness
suddenly
developed
in
the
annas
he
felt
insecure
as
though
he
did
understand
and
had
got
hold
they
seemed
to
him
very
like
eels
and
this
elliott
what
did
he
think
was
after
anyway
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
mr
twist
set
his
teeth
he
defied
elliott
he
defied
the
germans
he
would
see
this
thing
successful
this
open
arms
business
or
his
name
was
twist
and
he
stuck
out
his
jaw
or
would
have
stuck
it
out
if
he
had
been
prevented
by
the
amiable
weakness
of
that
feature
but
spiritually
and
morally
when
he
got
back
into
the
house
he
was
all
jaw
chapter
xxxiv
that
night
he
determined
he
would
go
into
acapulco
next
morning
and
drop
in
at
his
bank
and
at
his
lawyer
and
other
places
and
see
if
he
could
pick
up
anything
that
would
explain
why
americans
would
come
and
have
tea
at
the
open
arms
he
even
thought
he
might
look
up
old
ridding
he
did
sleep
he
lay
all
night
thinking
the
evening
had
been
spent
with
was
in
bed
sleeping
off
her
tears
bilton
had
another
headache
and
disappeared
early
so
he
was
left
with
who
slouched
about
abstractedly
eating
up
the
remains
of
she
did
talk
except
once
to
remark
a
little
pensively
that
her
inside
was
dreadfully
full
of
cold
stuff
and
that
she
knew
now
what
it
must
feel
like
to
be
a
mausoleum
but
eyeing
her
sideways
as
he
sat
before
the
fire
mr
twist
could
see
that
she
was
still
smug
he
did
talk
either
he
felt
he
had
nothing
at
present
to
say
to
that
would
serve
a
useful
purpose
and
was
besides
reluctant
to
hear
any
she
might
make
watchfulness
was
what
was
required
silent
watchfulness
and
wariness
and
firmness
in
fact
all
the
things
that
were
most
foreign
to
his
nature
thought
mr
twist
resentful
and
fatigued
next
morning
he
had
a
cup
of
coffee
in
his
room
brought
by
li
koo
and
then
drove
himself
into
acapulco
in
his
ford
without
seeing
the
others
it
was
another
of
the
perfect
days
which
he
was
now
beginning
to
take
as
a
matter
of
course
so
many
had
there
been
since
his
arrival
people
talked
of
the
wet
days
and
of
their
desolate
abundance
once
they
started
but
there
had
been
as
yet
no
sign
of
them
the
mornings
succeeded
each
other
radiant
and
calm
november
was
merging
into
december
in
placid
loveliness
oh
yes
said
mr
twist
to
himself
sardonically
as
he
drove
down
the
lane
in
the
gracious
light
and
crickets
chirped
at
him
and
warm
scents
drifted
across
his
face
and
the
flowers
in
the
grass
standing
so
bright
and
unruffled
that
they
seemed
almost
as
profoundly
pleased
as
nodded
at
him
and
everything
was
obviously
perfectly
contented
and
happy
oh
yes
i
daresay
and
he
repeated
this
remark
several
times
as
he
looked
round
him
he
could
but
look
it
was
all
so
beautiful
these
things
had
to
deal
with
twinklers
no
wonder
they
could
be
calm
and
bright
so
could
he
if
he
turned
a
corner
in
the
lane
and
saw
some
way
down
it
two
figures
a
man
and
a
girl
sitting
in
the
grass
by
the
wayside
lovers
of
course
oh
yes
i
daresay
said
mr
twist
again
grimly
they
had
to
deal
with
twinklers
either
no
wonder
they
could
sit
happily
in
the
grass
so
could
he
if
at
the
noise
of
the
approaching
car
with
the
smile
of
the
last
thing
they
had
been
saying
still
on
their
faces
the
two
turned
their
heads
and
it
was
that
man
elliott
and
hello
called
out
mr
twist
putting
on
the
brakes
so
hard
that
the
ford
skidded
sideways
along
the
road
towards
them
hello
said
the
young
man
cheerfully
waving
his
stick
hello
said
mildly
watching
his
sidelong
approach
with
complacent
interest
she
had
no
hat
on
and
had
evidently
escaped
from
bilton
just
as
she
was
escaped
however
was
far
too
violent
a
word
mr
twist
felt
sauntered
from
bilton
better
described
her
effect
of
natural
and
comfortable
arrival
at
the
place
where
she
was
i
did
know
you
were
here
said
mr
twist
addressing
her
when
the
car
had
stopped
he
felt
it
was
a
lame
remark
he
had
torrents
of
things
he
wanted
to
say
and
this
was
all
that
came
out
considered
it
placidly
for
a
moment
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
worth
answering
so
she
did
going
into
the
town
inquired
elliott
pleasantly
yes
i
give
you
a
lift
no
thanks
i
just
come
from
there
i
see
then
better
come
with
me
said
mr
twist
to
i
afraid
i
ca
i
rather
busy
this
morning
really
said
mr
twist
in
a
voice
of
concentrated
sarcasm
but
it
had
no
effect
on
she
continued
to
contemplate
him
with
perfect
goodwill
he
hesitated
a
moment
what
could
he
do
nothing
that
he
could
see
before
the
young
man
nothing
that
would
make
him
ridiculous
he
felt
a
fool
already
he
ought
to
have
pulled
up
he
ought
to
have
just
waved
to
them
and
gone
on
his
way
and
afterwards
in
the
seclusion
of
his
office
issued
very
plain
directions
to
as
to
her
future
conduct
sitting
by
the
roadside
like
that
openly
before
everybody
with
a
young
man
she
had
never
seen
hours
ago
he
jammed
in
the
gear
and
let
the
clutch
out
with
such
a
jerk
that
the
car
leaped
forward
elliott
waved
his
stick
again
mr
twist
responded
by
the
briefest
touch
of
his
cap
and
whirred
down
the
road
out
of
sight
does
he
mind
your
sitting
here
asked
elliott
it
would
be
very
unreasonable
said
gently
one
has
to
sit
somewhere
and
he
laughed
with
delight
at
this
answer
as
he
laughed
with
delight
at
everything
she
said
and
he
told
her
for
the
twentieth
time
that
she
was
the
most
wonderful
person
he
had
ever
met
and
she
settled
down
to
listen
again
after
the
interruption
caused
by
mr
twist
with
a
ready
ear
and
the
utmost
complacency
to
these
agreeable
statements
and
began
to
wonder
whether
perhaps
after
all
she
might
at
last
be
about
to
fall
in
love
in
the
new
interest
of
this
possibility
she
turned
her
head
to
look
at
him
and
he
told
her
tumultuously
for
being
a
he
went
straight
ahead
on
great
waves
when
it
came
to
that
her
eyes
were
as
if
pansies
had
married
stars
she
turned
her
head
away
again
at
this
for
though
it
sounded
lovely
it
made
her
feel
a
little
shy
and
unprovided
with
an
answer
and
then
he
said
again
tumultuously
that
her
ear
was
the
most
perfect
thing
ever
stuck
on
a
girl
cheek
and
would
she
mind
turning
her
face
to
him
so
that
he
might
see
if
she
had
another
just
like
it
on
the
other
side
she
blushed
at
this
because
she
could
remember
whether
she
had
washed
it
lately
or
not
one
so
easily
forgot
one
ears
there
were
so
many
different
things
to
wash
and
he
told
her
that
when
she
blushed
it
was
like
the
first
wild
rose
of
the
first
summer
morning
of
the
world
at
this
was
quite
overcome
and
subsided
into
a
condition
of
blissful
quiescent
waiting
for
whatever
might
come
next
fancy
her
face
reminding
him
of
all
those
nice
things
she
had
seen
it
every
day
for
years
and
years
in
the
and
not
noticed
anything
particular
about
it
it
had
seemed
to
her
just
a
face
something
you
saw
out
of
and
ate
with
and
had
to
clean
whatever
else
you
did
when
you
were
late
for
breakfast
because
there
it
was
and
could
be
hidden
an
object
remote
indeed
from
pansies
and
stars
and
beautiful
things
like
that
she
would
have
liked
to
explain
this
to
the
young
man
and
point
out
that
she
feared
his
imagination
ran
ahead
of
the
facts
and
that
perhaps
when
his
leg
was
well
again
he
would
see
things
more
as
they
were
but
to
her
surprise
when
she
turned
to
him
to
tell
him
this
she
found
she
was
obliged
to
look
away
at
once
again
she
could
look
at
him
fancy
that
now
thought
attentively
gazing
at
her
toes
and
he
had
such
dear
eyes
and
such
a
dear
eager
sort
of
face
all
the
more
then
she
reasoned
should
her
own
eyes
have
dwelt
with
pleasure
on
him
but
they
could
dear
me
she
murmured
watching
her
toes
as
carefully
as
if
they
might
at
any
moment
go
away
and
leave
her
there
i
know
said
elliott
you
think
i
talking
fearful
flowery
stuff
i
have
said
dear
me
at
myself
three
years
ago
if
i
had
ever
caught
myself
thinking
in
terms
of
stars
and
roses
but
it
all
the
beastly
blood
and
muck
of
the
war
that
does
it
sends
one
back
with
a
rush
to
things
like
that
makes
one
shameless
why
i
talk
to
you
about
god
now
without
turning
a
hair
nothing
would
have
induced
me
so
much
as
to
mention
seriously
that
i
even
heard
of
him
three
years
ago
why
i
write
poetry
now
we
all
write
poetry
and
nobody
would
mind
now
being
seen
saying
their
prayers
why
if
i
were
back
at
school
and
my
mother
came
to
see
me
i
hug
her
before
everybody
in
the
middle
of
the
street
do
you
realize
what
a
tremendous
change
that
means
you
little
girl
who
never
had
brothers
you
extraordinary
adorable
little
lovely
thing
and
off
he
was
again
when
i
was
small
said
after
a
while
still
watching
her
feet
i
had
a
governess
who
urged
me
to
consider
before
i
said
anything
whether
it
were
the
sort
of
thing
i
would
like
to
say
in
the
hearing
of
my
parents
would
you
like
to
say
what
you
saying
to
me
in
the
hearing
of
your
parents
hate
to
said
elliott
promptly
well
then
said
gentle
but
disappointed
she
rather
wished
now
she
had
mentioned
it
i
take
you
out
of
earshot
said
elliott
she
was
much
relieved
she
had
done
what
she
felt
might
perhaps
be
regarded
by
aunt
alice
as
her
duty
as
a
lady
and
could
now
give
herself
up
with
a
calm
conscience
to
hearing
whatever
else
he
might
have
to
say
and
he
had
an
incredible
amount
to
say
and
all
of
it
of
the
most
highly
gratifying
nature
on
the
whole
looking
at
it
all
round
and
taking
one
thing
with
another
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
the
most
agreeable
and
profitable
morning
she
had
ever
spent
she
sat
there
for
hours
and
they
all
flew
people
passed
in
cars
and
saw
her
and
it
did
disturb
her
in
the
least
she
perfectly
remembered
she
ought
to
be
helping
pick
and
arrange
the
flowers
for
the
and
she
did
mind
she
knew
would
be
astonished
and
angry
at
her
absence
and
it
left
her
unmoved
by
midday
she
was
hopelessly
compromised
in
the
eyes
of
acapulco
for
the
people
who
had
motored
through
the
lane
told
the
people
who
had
what
they
had
seen
once
a
great
car
passed
with
a
small
widow
in
it
who
looked
astonished
when
she
saw
the
pair
but
had
gone
almost
before
elliott
could
call
out
and
wave
to
her
that
my
sister
he
said
you
and
she
will
love
each
other
shall
we
said
much
pleased
by
this
suggestion
of
continuity
in
their
relations
and
remarked
that
she
looked
as
if
she
had
got
a
husband
she
has
poor
little
thing
rotten
luck
rotten
i
hate
people
to
die
now
it
seems
so
infernally
unnatural
of
them
when
they
not
in
the
fighting
he
only
been
dead
a
month
and
poor
old
dellogg
was
such
a
decent
chap
she
is
going
anywhere
yet
or
i
bring
her
up
to
tea
this
afternoon
but
it
does
matter
i
take
you
to
her
shall
you
said
again
much
pleased
dellogg
the
name
swam
through
her
mind
and
swam
out
again
she
was
too
busy
enjoying
herself
to
remark
it
and
its
coincidences
now
of
course
it
the
first
thing
one
does
what
first
thing
to
take
the
divine
girl
to
see
one
relations
once
one
has
found
her
once
one
has
had
his
voice
fell
to
a
whisper
the
luck
to
find
her
and
he
laid
his
hand
very
gently
on
hers
which
were
clasped
together
in
her
lap
this
was
a
situation
to
which
was
accustomed
and
she
did
know
what
to
do
with
it
she
looked
down
at
the
hand
lying
on
hers
and
considered
it
without
moving
elliott
was
quite
silent
now
and
she
knew
he
was
watching
her
face
ought
she
perhaps
to
be
going
was
this
perhaps
one
of
the
moments
in
life
when
the
truly
judicious
went
but
what
a
pity
to
go
just
when
everything
was
so
pleasant
still
it
must
be
nearly
what
would
aunt
alice
do
in
a
similar
situation
go
home
to
lunch
she
was
sure
yet
what
was
lunch
when
one
was
rapidly
arriving
as
she
was
sure
now
that
she
was
at
the
condition
of
being
in
love
she
must
be
or
she
would
like
his
hand
on
hers
and
she
did
like
it
she
looked
down
at
it
and
found
that
she
wanted
to
stroke
it
but
would
aunt
alice
stroke
it
no
felt
fairly
clear
about
that
aunt
alice
would
stroke
it
she
would
take
it
up
and
shake
it
and
say
and
walk
off
home
to
lunch
like
a
lady
well
perhaps
she
ought
to
do
that
christopher
would
probably
think
so
too
but
what
a
pity
still
behaviour
was
behaviour
ladies
were
ladies
she
drew
out
her
right
hand
with
this
polite
intention
and
instead
never
knew
how
it
happened
she
did
nothing
of
the
sort
but
quite
the
contrary
she
put
it
softly
on
the
top
of
his
chapter
xxxv
meanwhile
mr
twist
had
driven
on
towards
acapulco
in
a
state
of
painful
indecision
should
he
or
should
he
take
a
turning
he
knew
of
a
couple
of
miles
farther
that
led
up
an
unused
and
practically
undrivable
track
back
by
the
west
side
to
the
open
arms
and
instruct
bilton
to
proceed
at
once
down
the
lane
and
salvage
should
he
or
should
he
for
the
first
mile
he
decided
he
would
then
as
his
anger
cooled
he
began
to
think
that
after
all
he
need
worry
much
the
annas
were
lucidly
too
young
for
serious
philandering
and
even
if
that
elliott
did
realize
this
owing
to
great
length
he
could
do
much
before
he
mr
twist
was
back
again
along
the
lane
in
this
he
the
enterprise
of
the
british
navy
but
it
served
to
calm
him
so
that
when
he
did
reach
the
turning
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
continue
on
his
way
to
acapulco
there
he
spent
some
perplexing
and
harassing
hours
at
the
bank
his
reception
was
distinctly
chilly
he
was
used
since
his
teapot
had
been
on
the
market
to
anything
but
warmth
when
he
went
into
a
bank
on
this
occasion
even
the
clerks
were
cold
and
when
after
difficulty
actual
difficulty
he
succeeded
in
seeing
the
manager
he
could
but
perceive
his
unusual
reserve
he
then
remembered
what
he
had
put
down
to
mere
accident
at
the
time
that
as
he
drove
up
main
street
half
an
hour
before
all
the
people
he
knew
had
been
looking
the
other
way
from
the
bank
where
he
picked
up
nothing
in
the
way
of
explanation
of
the
american
avoidance
of
the
open
arms
the
manager
going
dumb
at
its
mere
mention
he
went
to
the
solicitors
who
had
arranged
the
sale
of
the
inn
and
again
in
the
street
people
he
knew
looked
the
other
way
the
solicitor
it
appeared
would
be
back
till
the
afternoon
and
the
clerk
an
elderly
person
hitherto
subservient
was
curiously
short
about
it
by
this
time
mr
twist
was
thoroughly
uneasy
and
he
determined
to
ask
the
first
acquaintance
he
met
what
the
matter
was
but
he
could
find
anybody
every
one
his
architect
his
various
experts
those
genial
and
frolicsome
young
men
were
either
engaged
or
away
on
business
somewhere
else
he
set
his
teeth
and
drove
to
the
cosmopolitan
to
seek
out
old
ridding
it
was
a
place
he
drove
to
willingly
after
his
recent
undignified
departure
but
he
was
determined
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
thing
and
walking
into
the
parlour
was
instantly
aware
of
a
hush
falling
upon
it
a
holding
of
the
breath
in
the
distance
he
saw
old
ridding
distinctly
and
distinctly
he
saw
that
old
ridding
saw
him
he
was
sitting
at
the
far
end
of
the
great
parlour
facing
the
entrance
by
the
side
of
something
vast
and
black
heaped
up
in
the
adjacent
chair
he
had
the
look
on
his
pink
and
naturally
pleasant
face
of
one
who
has
abandoned
hope
on
seeing
mr
twist
a
ray
of
interest
lit
him
up
and
he
half
rose
the
formless
mass
in
the
next
chair
which
mr
twist
had
taken
for
inanimate
matter
probably
cushions
and
wraps
and
now
perceived
was
one
of
the
higher
mammals
put
out
a
hand
and
said
something
at
least
it
opened
that
part
of
its
face
which
is
called
a
mouth
but
which
to
mr
twist
in
the
heated
and
abnormal
condition
of
his
brain
seemed
like
the
of
some
great
bag
and
at
that
moment
a
group
of
people
crossed
the
hall
in
front
of
old
ridding
and
when
the
path
was
again
clear
the
chair
that
had
contained
him
was
empty
he
had
disappeared
completely
only
the
higher
mammal
was
left
watching
mr
twist
with
heavy
eyes
like
two
smouldering
coals
he
could
face
those
eyes
he
did
try
to
and
hesitated
while
he
tried
and
then
he
found
he
could
so
he
swerved
away
to
the
right
and
went
out
quickly
by
the
side
door
there
was
now
one
other
person
left
who
would
perhaps
clear
him
up
as
to
the
meaning
of
all
this
and
he
was
the
lawyer
he
had
gone
to
about
the
guardianship
true
he
had
been
angry
with
him
at
the
time
but
that
was
chiefly
because
he
had
been
angry
with
himself
at
bottom
he
had
carried
away
an
impression
of
friendliness
to
this
man
he
would
now
go
as
a
last
resource
before
turning
back
home
and
once
more
he
raced
up
main
street
in
his
ford
producing
by
these
repeated
appearances
an
effect
of
agitation
and
restlessness
that
was
lost
on
the
beholders
the
lawyer
was
in
his
office
and
disengaged
after
his
experience
mr
twist
was
quite
surprised
and
much
relieved
by
being
admitted
at
once
he
was
received
neither
coldly
nor
warmly
but
with
unmistakable
interest
i
come
to
consult
you
said
mr
twist
the
lawyer
nodded
he
had
supposed
he
had
come
not
to
consult
him
but
he
was
used
to
patience
with
clients
and
he
well
knew
their
preference
in
conversation
for
the
i
want
a
straight
answer
to
a
straight
question
said
mr
twist
his
great
spectacles
glaring
anxiously
at
the
lawyer
who
again
nodded
go
on
he
said
as
mr
twist
paused
what
i
want
to
know
is
burst
out
mr
twist
what
the
hell
the
lawyer
put
up
a
hand
one
moment
mr
twist
he
said
sorry
to
interrupt
and
he
got
up
quickly
and
went
to
a
door
in
the
partition
between
his
office
and
his
clerks
room
you
may
go
out
to
lunch
now
he
said
opening
it
a
crack
he
then
shut
it
and
came
back
to
his
seat
at
the
table
yes
mr
twist
he
said
settling
down
again
you
were
inquiring
what
the
hell
well
i
was
about
to
said
mr
twist
suddenly
soothed
but
you
so
calm
of
course
i
calm
i
a
quietly
married
man
i
do
see
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
everything
for
some
dispositions
everything
mine
is
one
yours
is
another
well
i
guess
i
not
come
here
to
talk
about
marriage
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
quite
so
said
the
lawyer
as
he
stopped
and
i
can
tell
you
because
your
inn
is
suspected
of
being
run
in
the
interests
of
the
german
government
a
deep
silence
fell
upon
the
room
the
lawyer
watched
mr
twist
with
a
detached
and
highly
intelligent
interest
mr
twist
stared
at
the
lawyer
his
kind
lavish
lips
fallen
apart
anger
had
left
him
this
blow
excluded
anger
there
was
only
room
in
him
for
blank
astonishment
you
know
about
my
teapot
he
said
at
last
try
me
again
mr
twist
it
on
every
american
breakfast
table
including
my
own
they
would
use
it
if
they
thought
my
dear
sir
they
not
going
to
said
the
lawyer
proposing
among
other
little
plans
for
conveying
the
general
sentiment
to
your
notice
to
boycott
the
teapot
it
is
to
be
put
on
an
unofficial
black
list
it
is
to
be
banished
from
the
hotels
mr
twist
stare
became
frozen
the
teapot
boycotted
the
teapot
his
mother
and
sister
depended
on
and
the
open
arms
depended
on
and
all
his
happiness
and
the
twins
he
saw
the
rumour
surging
over
america
in
great
swift
waves
that
the
proceeds
of
the
twist
were
used
for
germany
he
saw
but
what
did
he
see
in
that
moment
of
submerged
horror
then
he
seemed
to
come
to
the
surface
again
and
resume
reason
with
a
gasp
why
he
asked
why
they
wanting
to
boycott
the
teapot
no
why
do
they
think
the
inn
the
miss
twinklers
are
german
half
the
half
that
matters
begging
my
absent
wife
pardon
i
know
all
about
that
you
see
you
started
me
off
thinking
them
over
by
that
ward
notion
of
yours
it
did
take
me
long
it
was
pretty
transparent
so
transparent
that
my
opinion
of
the
intelligence
of
my
has
considerably
lowered
but
we
live
in
unbalanced
times
i
guess
women
at
the
bottom
of
this
women
got
on
to
it
first
and
the
others
caught
the
idea
as
they
catch
scarlet
fever
it
a
kind
of
scarlet
fever
this
spy
scare
that
about
mind
you
i
admit
the
germs
are
certainly
present
among
us
and
the
lawyer
smiled
he
thought
he
saw
he
had
made
a
little
joke
in
that
last
remark
mr
twist
was
not
in
the
condition
to
see
jokes
and
did
smile
do
you
mean
to
say
those
children
he
began
they
not
regarded
as
children
by
any
one
except
you
well
if
they
not
said
mr
twist
remembering
the
grass
by
the
wayside
in
the
lane
and
what
he
had
so
recently
met
in
it
i
guess
best
be
making
tracks
but
i
know
better
and
so
would
you
if
you
seen
them
on
the
boat
why
twelve
was
putting
their
age
too
high
on
that
boat
no
doubt
no
doubt
then
all
i
can
say
is
they
matured
pretty
considerably
since
now
do
you
really
want
me
to
tell
you
what
is
being
believed
of
course
it
what
i
come
for
you
may
find
it
precisely
exhilarating
mr
twist
go
ahead
what
acapulco
says
and
los
angeles
i
told
too
and
probably
by
this
time
the
whole
coast
is
that
you
threw
over
your
widowed
mother
of
whom
you
the
only
son
and
came
off
here
with
two
german
girls
who
got
hold
of
you
on
the
boat
now
mr
twist
do
interrupt
on
the
boat
crossing
from
england
that
england
had
turned
them
out
as
undesirable
aliens
quite
so
mr
twist
but
let
me
finish
that
in
the
pay
of
the
german
government
no
doubt
no
doubt
mr
twist
and
that
you
their
it
is
known
that
the
inn
each
afternoon
has
been
crowded
with
germans
among
them
germans
already
suspected
i
say
how
rightly
or
how
wrongly
of
spying
and
that
these
people
are
so
familiar
with
the
miss
von
twinklers
as
to
warrant
the
belief
in
a
complete
secret
understanding
for
a
moment
mr
twist
continued
both
his
silence
and
his
stare
then
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
wiped
them
his
hand
shook
the
lawyer
was
startled
was
there
going
to
be
emotion
one
never
knew
with
that
sort
of
lips
you
not
he
began
then
he
saw
that
mr
twist
was
trying
not
to
laugh
i
glad
you
take
it
that
way
he
said
relieved
but
surprised
it
so
darned
funny
said
mr
twist
endeavouring
to
compose
his
features
to
anybody
who
knows
those
twins
it
so
darned
funny
yes
rather
feel
that
myself
that
does
seem
a
bit
of
a
bull
eye
and
for
a
second
or
two
his
features
flatly
refused
to
compose
the
lawyer
watched
him
yes
he
said
yes
but
the
effect
of
these
beliefs
may
be
awkward
oh
damned
agreed
mr
twist
going
solemn
again
and
there
came
over
him
in
a
flood
the
clear
perception
of
what
it
would
mean
the
sheer
disaster
of
it
the
horrible
situation
those
helpless
annas
would
be
in
what
a
limitless
fool
he
must
have
been
in
his
conduct
of
the
whole
thing
his
absorption
in
the
material
side
of
it
had
done
the
trick
he
had
been
clever
enough
not
imaginative
enough
nor
failing
that
worldly
enough
to
work
the
other
side
properly
when
he
found
there
was
no
dellogg
he
ought
to
have
insisted
on
seeing
dellogg
intrusion
or
no
intrusion
and
handing
over
the
twins
and
then
gone
away
and
left
them
a
woman
was
what
was
wanted
fool
that
he
was
to
suppose
that
he
a
man
an
unmarried
man
could
get
them
into
anything
but
a
scrape
but
he
was
so
fond
of
them
he
just
could
leave
them
and
now
here
they
all
were
in
this
ridiculous
and
terrible
situation
there
are
two
things
you
can
do
said
the
lawyer
two
said
mr
twist
looking
at
him
with
anxious
eyes
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
see
even
one
except
running
amoke
in
slander
actions
tut
tut
said
the
lawyer
waving
that
aside
no
there
are
two
courses
to
pursue
and
they
not
alternative
but
simultaneous
you
shut
down
the
inn
at
once
that
saturday
close
on
saturday
and
give
notice
you
do
now
pray
let
me
finish
close
the
inn
as
an
inn
and
use
it
simply
as
a
private
residence
then
as
quick
as
may
be
marry
those
girls
marry
what
girls
the
miss
von
twinklers
mr
twist
stared
at
him
marry
them
he
said
helplessly
marry
them
who
to
you
for
one
mr
twist
stared
at
him
in
silence
then
he
said
you
said
that
to
me
before
yep
and
i
say
it
again
i
go
on
saying
it
till
you
done
it
if
that
all
you
got
to
offer
as
a
suggestion
for
a
way
out
but
mr
twist
was
angry
this
time
he
was
too
much
battered
by
events
he
had
the
spirits
to
be
angry
you
got
to
marry
one
of
those
girls
said
the
lawyer
at
each
word
smiting
the
table
with
his
open
palm
turn
her
into
an
american
get
her
out
of
this
being
a
german
business
and
be
able
at
the
same
time
to
protect
the
one
who
be
your
sister
why
even
if
you
did
want
to
which
is
sheer
nonsense
for
of
course
any
man
would
want
to
i
know
what
i
talking
about
because
i
seen
them
it
your
plain
duty
having
got
them
into
this
mess
but
marry
which
asked
mr
twist
with
increased
helplessness
and
yet
a
manifest
profound
anxiety
for
further
advice
for
the
first
time
the
lawyer
showed
impatience
oh
either
or
both
he
said
for
god
sake
do
be
such
a
he
pulled
up
short
i
did
quite
mean
that
he
resumed
again
calm
the
end
of
that
sentence
was
as
no
doubt
you
guess
fool
i
withdraw
it
and
will
substitute
something
milder
have
you
any
objection
to
ninny
no
mr
twist
did
mind
ninny
or
any
other
word
the
lawyer
might
choose
he
was
in
such
a
condition
of
mental
groping
about
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
away
the
beads
on
his
forehead
and
round
his
mouth
i
he
said
looking
terribly
worried
propose
to
an
anna
the
lawyer
may
have
seen
them
but
he
had
heard
them
and
the
probable
nature
of
their
comments
if
mr
twist
proposed
to
them
to
one
he
meant
of
course
but
both
would
comment
the
one
he
proposed
to
and
the
one
he
did
caused
his
imagination
to
reel
he
had
much
imagination
he
knew
that
now
after
his
conduct
of
this
whole
affair
but
all
there
was
of
it
reeled
i
he
said
helplessly
pooh
said
the
lawyer
indicating
the
negligibleness
of
this
by
a
movement
of
his
shoulder
they
seventeen
said
mr
twist
pooh
said
the
lawyer
again
again
indicating
negligibleness
my
wife
was
i
know
you
told
me
that
last
time
oh
i
know
all
said
mr
twist
with
sudden
passion
but
these
are
children
i
tell
you
pooh
said
the
lawyer
a
third
time
a
third
time
indicating
negligibleness
then
he
got
up
and
held
out
his
hand
well
i
told
you
he
said
you
wanted
to
know
and
i
told
you
and
i
tell
you
one
thing
more
mr
twist
whichever
of
those
girls
takes
you
you
have
the
sweetest
prettiest
wife
of
any
man
in
the
world
except
one
and
the
man
who
has
the
luck
to
get
the
other
one
why
sweetest
and
prettiest
are
poor
words
she
be
the
most
delectable
the
most
mr
twist
rose
from
his
chair
in
such
haste
that
he
pushed
the
table
crooked
his
ears
flamed
see
here
he
said
very
loud
i
wo
have
you
talk
familiarly
like
that
about
my
wife
chapter
xxxvi
wife
the
word
had
a
remarkable
effect
on
him
it
churned
him
all
up
his
thoughts
were
a
chaotic
jumble
and
his
driving
on
the
way
home
matched
them
he
had
at
least
three
narrow
shaves
at
cross
streets
before
he
got
out
of
the
town
and
for
an
entire
mile
afterwards
he
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
during
this
period
deep
as
he
was
in
confused
thought
he
could
but
vaguely
notice
the
anger
on
the
faces
of
the
other
drivers
and
the
variety
and
fury
of
their
gesticulations
and
it
roused
a
dim
wonder
in
him
wife
how
arid
existence
had
been
for
him
up
to
then
in
regard
to
the
affections
how
knobbly
the
sort
of
kisses
he
had
received
in
clark
they
were
kisses
they
were
disapproving
pecks
always
disapproving
always
as
if
he
had
done
enough
or
been
enough
or
was
suspected
of
not
going
to
do
or
be
enough
his
wife
mr
twist
dreadfully
longed
to
kiss
somebody
somebody
kind
and
soft
who
would
let
herself
be
adored
she
need
even
love
him
he
knew
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
set
passion
alight
she
need
only
be
kind
and
a
little
fond
of
him
and
let
him
love
her
and
be
his
very
own
his
own
little
wife
how
sweet
how
almost
painfully
sweet
yes
but
the
annas
when
he
thought
of
the
annas
mr
twist
went
damp
he
might
propose
indeed
everything
pointed
to
his
simply
having
got
to
but
would
they
very
quickly
dispose
and
then
what
that
lawyer
seemed
to
think
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
marry
them
right
away
not
them
of
course
one
but
they
were
so
very
plural
in
his
mind
funny
man
thought
mr
twist
funny
man
yet
otherwise
so
sagacious
it
is
true
he
need
only
propose
to
one
of
them
for
which
he
thanked
god
but
he
could
imagine
what
that
one
and
what
the
other
one
too
who
would
be
sure
to
be
somewhere
quite
near
would
no
he
could
imagine
he
preferred
not
to
imagine
mr
twist
dampness
increased
and
a
passing
car
got
his
it
was
a
big
car
which
crackled
with
language
as
it
whizzed
on
its
way
and
mr
twist
slewed
by
the
impact
half
across
the
road
then
perceived
on
which
side
he
had
been
driving
the
lane
up
to
the
inn
was
in
its
emptiness
and
somnolence
where
and
elliott
had
been
sitting
cool
and
shaded
when
he
passed
before
there
was
only
the
grass
and
crushed
flowers
in
a
glare
of
sun
she
had
gone
home
long
ago
of
course
she
said
she
was
going
to
be
very
busy
secretly
he
wished
she
had
gone
home
and
that
little
christopher
too
might
for
a
bit
be
somewhere
else
so
that
when
he
arrived
he
would
immediately
have
to
face
everybody
at
once
he
wanted
to
think
he
wanted
to
have
time
to
think
time
before
four
came
and
with
four
if
he
had
come
to
any
conclusion
about
shutting
up
the
inn
and
how
could
he
if
nobody
gave
him
time
to
think
those
accursed
swarming
germans
it
was
they
who
had
done
all
this
mr
twist
blazed
into
sudden
fury
they
and
their
blasted
war
at
the
gate
stood
her
face
looked
quite
pale
in
the
green
shade
of
the
syringa
bushes
she
as
peering
out
down
the
lane
watching
him
approach
this
was
awful
thought
mr
twist
at
the
very
gate
one
of
them
confronted
at
once
no
time
not
a
minute
time
given
him
to
think
oh
cried
out
the
instant
he
pulled
up
for
she
had
waved
to
him
to
stop
when
he
tried
to
drive
straight
on
round
to
the
stable
she
is
with
you
who
is
asked
mr
twist
became
paler
than
ever
she
has
been
kidnapped
she
said
how
that
said
mr
twist
staring
at
her
from
the
car
kidnapped
repeated
with
eyes
for
from
her
nursery
she
carried
with
her
at
the
bottom
of
her
mind
but
ready
to
fly
up
to
the
top
at
any
moment
of
panic
an
impression
that
the
chief
activities
and
recreations
of
all
those
americans
who
were
really
good
were
two
they
lynched
and
they
kidnapped
they
lynched
you
if
they
did
like
you
enough
and
if
they
liked
you
too
much
they
kidnapped
you
exquisite
and
unsuspecting
had
been
kidnapped
some
american
concupiscent
eye
had
alighted
on
her
observed
her
beauty
and
marked
her
down
no
other
explanation
was
possible
of
a
whole
morning
absence
from
duties
of
one
so
conscientious
and
painstaking
as
she
never
shirked
that
is
she
never
had
been
base
enough
to
shirk
alone
if
there
was
any
shirking
to
be
done
they
had
always
done
it
together
as
the
hours
passed
and
she
did
appear
had
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
she
must
have
motored
into
acapulco
with
mr
twist
strange
and
unnatural
and
reprehensible
and
ignoble
as
such
arch
shirking
would
have
been
and
now
that
the
car
had
come
back
empty
except
for
mr
twist
she
was
convinced
the
worst
had
happened
her
beautiful
her
precious
columbus
had
been
kidnapped
kidnapped
she
said
again
wringing
her
hands
mr
twist
was
too
for
he
thought
she
was
announcing
the
kidnapping
of
bilton
somehow
he
did
think
of
he
had
seen
her
too
recently
but
that
bilton
should
be
kidnapped
seemed
to
him
to
touch
the
lowest
depths
of
american
criminal
enterprise
and
depravity
at
the
same
time
though
he
recoiled
before
this
fresh
blow
a
thought
did
fan
through
his
mind
with
a
wonderful
effect
of
coolness
and
silence
then
they
gag
her
he
said
what
cried
as
though
a
whip
had
lashed
her
gag
her
and
pulling
open
the
gate
and
running
out
to
him
as
one
possessed
she
cried
again
gag
columbus
oh
that
it
is
it
said
mr
twist
with
relief
but
also
with
disappointment
well
if
it
that
way
i
can
tell
you
he
stopped
there
was
no
need
to
tell
her
for
round
the
bend
of
the
lane
walking
in
the
chequered
light
and
shade
as
leisurely
as
if
such
things
as
tours
of
absence
did
exist
or
a
distracted
household
or
an
anguished
christopher
with
indeed
a
complete
an
extraordinary
serenity
advanced
always
placid
her
placidity
at
this
moment
had
a
shining
quality
still
smug
she
was
now
of
a
glorified
smugness
if
one
could
imagine
a
lily
turned
into
a
god
or
a
young
god
turned
into
a
lily
and
walking
down
the
middle
of
a
californian
lane
it
would
be
far
out
thought
mr
twist
as
an
image
of
the
advancing
twinkler
the
god
would
be
so
young
that
he
was
still
a
boy
and
he
would
be
worrying
much
about
anything
in
the
past
or
in
the
future
and
he
just
be
coming
along
like
that
with
the
corners
of
his
mouth
a
little
turned
up
and
his
fair
hair
a
little
ruffled
and
his
charming
young
face
full
of
a
sober
and
abstracted
radiance
not
much
kidnapping
there
i
guess
said
mr
twist
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
and
you
take
it
from
me
anna
he
added
quickly
leaning
over
towards
her
determined
to
get
off
to
the
garage
before
he
found
himself
faced
by
both
twins
together
that
when
next
your
imagination
gets
the
jumps
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
hold
on
to
it
hard
till
it
settles
down
again
instead
of
wasting
your
time
and
ruining
your
constitution
going
pale
and
he
started
the
ford
with
a
bound
and
got
away
round
the
corner
into
the
yard
here
in
the
yard
was
peace
at
least
for
the
moment
the
only
living
thing
in
it
was
a
cat
the
twins
had
acquired
through
the
services
of
one
of
the
experts
as
an
indispensable
object
in
a
really
homey
home
the
first
thing
this
cat
had
done
had
been
to
eat
the
canary
which
gave
the
twins
much
unacknowledged
relief
it
was
they
thought
secretly
quite
a
good
plan
to
have
one
pets
inside
each
other
it
kept
them
so
quiet
she
now
sat
unmoved
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
carefully
cleaning
her
whiskers
while
mr
twist
did
some
difficult
fancy
driving
in
order
to
get
into
the
stable
without
inconveniencing
her
admirable
picture
of
peace
thought
mr
twist
with
a
sigh
of
envy
he
might
have
got
out
and
picked
her
up
but
he
was
glad
to
manoeuvre
about
reversing
and
making
intricate
figures
in
the
dust
because
it
kept
him
longer
away
from
the
the
cat
took
no
notice
of
him
but
continued
to
deal
with
her
whiskers
even
when
his
front
wheel
was
within
two
inches
of
her
tail
for
though
she
had
been
long
at
the
open
arms
she
had
already
sized
up
mr
twist
and
was
aware
that
he
would
hurt
a
fly
thanks
to
her
he
had
a
lot
of
trouble
getting
the
ford
into
the
stable
all
of
which
he
liked
because
of
that
and
having
got
it
in
he
still
lingered
fiddling
about
with
it
examining
its
engine
and
wiping
its
bonnet
and
then
when
he
could
do
that
any
longer
he
went
out
and
lingered
in
the
yard
looking
down
at
the
cat
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
must
think
he
kept
on
saying
to
himself
lunchee
said
li
koo
putting
his
head
out
of
the
kitchen
window
all
right
said
mr
twist
he
stooped
down
as
though
to
examine
the
cat
ear
the
cat
who
like
her
ears
touched
but
was
prepared
to
humour
him
got
out
of
it
by
lying
down
on
her
back
and
showing
him
her
beautiful
white
stomach
she
was
a
black
cat
with
a
particularly
beautiful
white
stomach
and
she
had
discovered
that
nobody
could
see
it
without
wanting
to
stroke
it
whenever
she
found
herself
in
a
situation
that
threatened
to
become
disagreeable
she
just
lay
down
and
showed
her
stomach
human
beings
in
similar
predicaments
can
only
show
their
tact
nice
pussy
nice
nice
pussy
said
mr
twist
aloud
stroking
this
irresistible
object
slowly
and
forgetting
her
ear
as
she
had
intended
he
should
lunchee
get
cold
said
li
koo
again
putting
his
head
out
of
the
kitchen
window
mis
bilton
say
come
in
all
right
said
mr
twist
he
straightened
himself
and
looked
round
the
yard
a
rake
that
should
have
been
propped
up
against
the
with
some
other
gardening
tools
had
fallen
down
he
crossed
over
and
picked
it
up
and
stood
it
up
carefully
again
li
koo
watched
him
impassively
from
the
window
mis
bilton
come
out
he
said
and
there
she
was
in
the
yard
door
mr
twist
she
called
shrilly
if
you
do
come
in
right
away
and
have
your
food
before
it
gets
all
mushed
up
with
cold
i
guess
you
be
sorry
all
right
coming
he
called
back
very
loud
and
cheerfully
striding
towards
her
as
one
strides
who
knows
there
is
nothing
for
it
now
but
courage
all
right
bilton
sorry
if
i
kept
you
waiting
you
should
have
bothered
about
me
and
saying
things
like
this
in
a
loud
voice
for
to
hear
himself
being
loud
made
him
feel
more
supported
he
strode
into
the
house
through
the
house
and
out
on
to
the
verandah
they
always
lunched
on
the
verandah
the
golden
coloured
awning
was
down
and
the
place
was
full
of
a
golden
shade
beyond
it
blazed
the
garden
beneath
it
was
the
table
set
as
usual
ready
for
four
and
he
went
out
to
it
strung
up
to
finding
the
annas
at
the
table
in
her
usual
seat
with
her
back
to
the
garden
her
little
fair
head
outlined
against
the
glowing
light
as
he
had
seen
it
every
day
since
they
had
lived
in
the
inn
opposite
probably
volubly
and
passionately
addressing
her
and
there
was
no
one
why
he
said
stopping
short
yes
it
real
silly
of
them
not
to
come
and
eat
before
everything
is
spoilt
said
bilton
bustling
up
who
had
stayed
behind
to
give
an
order
to
li
koo
and
she
went
to
the
edge
of
the
verandah
and
shaded
her
eyes
and
called
gurls
gurls
i
guess
you
can
do
all
that
talking
better
after
lunch
he
then
saw
that
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
in
the
most
private
place
as
regards
being
overheard
partly
concealed
by
some
arum
lilies
that
grew
immensely
there
like
splendid
weeds
stood
the
twins
facing
each
other
better
leave
them
alone
he
said
quickly
they
come
when
ready
there
nothing
like
getting
through
with
one
talking
right
away
bilton
besides
he
went
on
still
more
quickly
for
she
plainly
did
agree
with
him
and
was
preparing
to
sally
out
into
the
sun
and
fetch
them
in
you
and
i
do
often
get
a
chance
of
a
quiet
chat
together
and
this
combined
with
the
resolute
way
he
was
holding
her
chair
ready
for
her
brought
bilton
back
under
the
awning
again
she
was
flattered
mr
twist
had
not
yet
spoken
to
her
in
quite
that
tone
he
had
always
been
the
gentleman
but
never
yet
the
eager
gentleman
now
he
was
unmistakably
both
she
came
back
and
sat
down
and
so
with
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
immediately
did
he
for
here
was
an
unexpected
respite
while
bilton
talked
he
could
think
fortunately
she
never
noticed
if
one
was
listening
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
her
he
gave
himself
up
willingly
to
the
great
broad
stream
that
at
once
started
flowing
over
him
on
this
occasion
with
something
of
the
comfort
of
warm
water
and
he
was
very
glad
indeed
that
anyhow
that
day
she
gagged
while
he
ate
he
kept
on
furtively
looking
down
the
garden
at
the
two
figures
facing
each
other
by
the
arum
lilies
whenever
bilton
remembered
them
and
wanted
to
call
them
in
as
she
did
at
the
different
stages
of
the
meal
at
the
salad
at
the
pudding
he
stopped
her
she
became
more
and
more
pleased
by
his
evident
determination
to
lunch
alone
with
her
for
after
all
one
remains
female
to
the
end
and
her
conversation
took
on
a
gradual
tinge
of
bilton
views
about
second
marriages
they
had
been
liberal
views
for
bilton
she
said
had
had
no
pettiness
about
him
but
they
were
lost
on
mr
twist
whose
thoughts
were
so
painfully
preoccupied
by
first
marriage
the
conclusions
he
came
to
during
that
trying
meal
while
bilton
talked
were
that
he
would
propose
first
to
she
being
the
eldest
and
such
a
course
being
accordingly
natural
and
if
she
refused
proceed
at
once
to
propose
to
but
before
proceeding
to
a
course
he
regarded
with
peculiar
misgiving
he
would
very
earnestly
explain
to
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
and
the
necessity
the
urgency
the
sanity
of
her
marrying
him
these
proposals
would
be
kept
on
the
cool
level
of
strict
business
every
trace
of
the
affection
with
which
he
was
so
overflowing
would
be
sternly
excluded
for
instance
he
was
going
to
let
himself
remember
the
feel
of
christopher
little
head
the
afternoon
before
when
he
patted
it
to
comfort
her
such
remembrances
would
be
bound
to
bring
a
warmth
into
his
remarks
which
would
be
fair
the
situation
demanded
the
most
scrupulous
fairness
and
delicacy
in
its
treatment
the
most
careful
avoidance
of
taking
any
advantage
of
it
but
how
difficult
thought
mr
twist
his
hand
shaking
as
he
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
iced
water
how
difficult
when
he
loved
the
annas
so
inconveniently
much
bilton
observed
the
shaking
of
his
hand
and
felt
more
female
than
ever
still
there
it
was
this
situation
forced
upon
them
all
by
the
war
nobody
could
help
it
and
it
had
to
be
faced
with
calmness
steadfastness
and
tact
calmness
steadfastness
and
tact
repeated
mr
twist
raising
the
water
to
his
mouth
and
spilling
some
of
it
bilton
observed
this
too
and
felt
still
more
female
marriage
was
the
quickest
and
really
the
only
way
out
of
it
he
saw
that
now
the
lawyer
had
been
quite
right
and
marriage
he
would
explain
to
the
annas
would
be
a
mere
formal
ceremony
which
after
the
war
they
he
meant
of
course
she
could
easily
in
that
land
of
facile
and
honourable
divorce
get
rid
of
meanwhile
he
would
point
out
they
she
of
course
bother
these
twins
would
be
safely
american
and
he
would
undertake
never
to
intrude
love
on
them
her
unless
by
some
wonderful
chance
it
was
wanted
some
wonderful
chance
mr
spectacles
suddenly
went
dim
and
he
gulped
down
more
water
yes
that
was
the
line
to
take
the
austere
line
of
for
the
twinkler
good
one
twinkler
would
be
his
wife
again
at
the
dear
word
he
had
to
gulp
down
water
and
one
his
they
would
just
have
to
agree
to
this
plan
the
position
was
too
serious
for
yes
that
was
the
line
to
take
and
by
the
time
he
had
got
to
the
coffee
it
was
perfectly
clear
and
plain
to
him
but
he
felt
dreadfully
damp
he
longed
for
a
liqueur
for
anything
that
would
support
him
is
there
any
brandy
in
the
house
he
suddenly
flung
across
the
web
of
bilton
words
brandy
mr
twist
she
repeated
at
this
feeling
altogether
female
for
what
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
ask
for
you
not
sick
with
my
coffee
murmured
mr
twist
his
mouth
very
slack
his
head
drooping
it
nice
i
go
and
see
said
bilton
getting
up
briskly
and
going
away
rattling
a
bunch
of
keys
at
once
he
looked
down
the
garden
was
in
the
act
of
putting
her
arm
round
shoulder
and
was
passionately
disengaging
herself
yes
there
was
trouble
there
he
knew
there
would
be
he
gulped
down
more
water
could
expect
to
go
off
like
that
for
a
whole
morning
and
give
a
horrible
fright
without
hearing
about
it
besides
the
expression
on
her
face
wanted
explaining
a
lot
of
explaining
mr
twist
did
like
to
think
so
but
recent
conduct
seemed
to
him
almost
artful
it
seemed
to
him
older
than
her
years
it
seemed
to
justify
the
lawyer
scepticism
when
he
described
the
twins
to
him
as
children
that
young
man
elliott
but
here
mr
twist
started
and
lost
his
thread
of
thought
for
looking
once
more
down
the
garden
he
saw
that
was
coming
towards
the
verandah
and
that
she
was
alone
had
vanished
why
had
he
bothered
about
brandy
and
let
bilton
go
he
had
counted
somehow
on
beginning
with
he
seized
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
he
tried
vainly
to
keep
his
hand
steady
before
the
cigarette
was
fairly
plight
there
was
walking
in
beneath
the
awning
i
glad
you
alone
she
said
for
i
want
to
speak
to
you
and
mr
twist
felt
that
his
hour
had
come
chapter
xxxvii
had
you
better
have
lunch
first
he
asked
though
he
knew
from
the
look
on
her
face
that
she
would
it
was
a
very
remarkable
look
it
was
as
though
an
angel
dwelling
in
perfect
bliss
had
unaccountably
got
its
feet
wet
not
more
troubled
than
that
a
little
troubled
but
not
more
than
that
no
thank
you
she
said
politely
but
if
you
finished
yours
do
you
mind
coming
into
the
office
because
otherwise
bilton
she
fetching
me
some
brandy
said
mr
twist
i
did
know
you
drank
said
even
at
this
moment
interested
but
do
you
mind
having
it
afterwards
because
otherwise
bilton
i
guess
the
idea
was
to
have
it
first
said
mr
twist
she
was
however
already
making
for
the
proceeding
towards
it
without
hurry
and
with
a
that
would
certainly
get
her
there
he
could
only
follow
in
the
office
she
said
do
you
mind
shutting
the
door
not
at
all
said
mr
twist
but
he
did
mind
his
hour
had
come
and
he
was
liking
it
he
wanted
to
begin
with
he
wanted
to
get
things
clear
with
her
first
before
dealing
with
this
one
there
was
less
of
and
her
dear
little
head
yesterday
when
he
patted
it
and
she
needed
comforting
cried
and
let
herself
be
comforted
and
it
was
so
sweet
to
mr
twist
to
comfort
christopher
began
directly
he
had
shut
the
door
i
know
she
mad
with
you
what
can
you
expect
anna
he
interrupted
in
a
very
voice
leaning
against
a
bookcase
even
a
bookcase
was
better
than
nothing
to
lean
against
christopher
is
being
unreasonable
said
her
voice
softer
and
gentler
than
he
had
yet
heard
it
then
she
stopped
and
considered
him
a
moment
with
much
of
the
look
of
one
who
on
a
rather
cold
day
considers
the
sea
before
diving
in
with
that
is
a
slight
but
temporary
reluctance
to
proceed
wo
you
sit
down
said
mr
twist
perhaps
i
better
she
said
disposing
herself
in
the
big
chair
it
very
strange
but
my
legs
feel
funny
you
would
think
being
in
love
would
make
one
want
to
sit
down
i
beg
your
pardon
said
mr
twist
i
have
fallen
in
love
said
looking
up
at
him
with
a
kind
of
pensive
radiance
i
did
it
this
morning
mr
twist
stared
at
her
i
beg
your
what
did
you
say
he
asked
she
said
still
with
that
air
as
she
regarded
him
of
pensive
radiance
of
not
seeing
him
but
something
beyond
him
that
was
very
beautiful
to
her
and
satisfactory
i
fallen
in
love
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
because
i
always
been
afraid
i
was
going
to
find
it
a
difficult
thing
to
do
but
it
was
quite
the
contrary
then
as
he
only
staged
at
her
she
said
he
coming
round
this
afternoon
on
the
new
footing
and
i
wanted
to
prepare
your
and
christopher
minds
in
good
time
so
that
you
should
be
surprised
and
having
said
this
she
lapsed
into
what
was
apparently
judging
from
her
expression
a
silent
contemplation
of
her
bliss
but
you
too
young
burst
out
mr
twist
too
young
repeated
coming
out
of
her
contemplation
for
a
moment
to
smile
at
him
we
do
think
so
well
this
beat
everything
mr
twist
could
only
stare
down
at
her
conflicting
emotions
raged
in
him
he
could
tell
for
a
moment
what
they
were
they
were
so
violent
and
so
varied
how
dared
elliott
how
dared
a
person
they
had
none
of
them
heard
of
that
time
yesterday
come
making
love
to
a
girl
he
had
never
seen
before
and
in
such
a
hurry
so
suddenly
so
instantly
here
had
he
himself
been
with
the
twins
constantly
for
weeks
and
would
have
dreamed
of
making
love
to
them
they
had
been
sacred
to
him
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
wanted
to
hug
them
often
and
often
but
he
had
restrained
himself
as
a
gentleman
should
from
the
highest
motives
of
delicacy
and
consideration
and
respect
and
propriety
besides
a
great
doubt
as
to
whether
they
would
very
energetically
mind
and
then
comes
along
this
blundering
britisher
and
straight
away
tumbles
right
in
where
mr
twist
had
feared
to
tread
and
within
hours
had
persuaded
to
think
she
was
in
love
new
footing
indeed
there
had
been
an
old
footing
yet
and
who
was
this
elliott
and
how
was
mr
twist
going
to
be
able
to
find
out
if
he
were
a
proper
person
to
be
allowed
to
pay
his
addresses
to
one
so
precious
as
a
twinkler
twin
anger
jealousy
anxiety
sense
of
responsibility
and
mortification
all
tumbled
about
furiously
together
inside
mr
twist
as
he
leaned
against
the
bookcase
and
gazed
down
at
who
for
her
part
was
gazing
beatifically
into
space
but
through
the
anger
and
the
jealousy
and
the
anxiety
and
the
sense
of
responsibility
and
mortification
one
great
thought
was
struggling
and
it
finally
pushed
every
other
aside
and
got
out
to
the
top
of
the
welter
here
in
the
chair
before
him
he
beheld
his
so
much
at
least
was
cleared
up
he
crossed
to
the
bureau
and
dragged
his
over
next
to
her
and
sat
down
so
that
it
is
it
he
said
trying
to
speak
very
calmly
but
his
face
pulled
all
sorts
of
ways
as
it
had
so
often
been
since
the
arrival
in
his
life
of
the
twins
yes
she
said
coming
out
of
her
contemplation
it
love
at
last
i
do
know
about
at
last
whichever
way
you
look
at
it
anna
that
do
seem
to
hit
it
off
as
a
word
what
i
meant
was
elliott
yes
said
which
is
the
same
thing
i
believe
she
added
i
now
have
to
allude
to
him
as
john
mr
twist
made
another
effort
to
speak
calmly
you
do
he
said
think
it
at
all
unusual
or
undesirable
that
you
should
be
calling
a
man
john
of
whom
you
never
heard
yesterday
i
think
it
wonderful
said
beaming
it
does
strike
you
in
any
way
as
imprudent
to
be
so
hasty
it
does
strike
you
as
foolish
on
the
contrary
said
i
ca
help
thinking
been
very
clever
i
should
have
thought
it
of
myself
you
see
not
quick
and
she
beamed
with
what
she
evidently
regarded
as
a
pardonable
pride
it
does
strike
you
as
even
a
little
well
a
little
improper
on
the
contrary
said
aunt
alice
told
us
that
the
one
man
one
could
never
be
improper
about
even
if
one
tried
was
husband
husband
mr
twist
winced
he
loved
as
we
have
seen
the
word
wife
but
then
that
was
different
it
not
time
yet
to
talk
of
husbands
he
said
full
of
a
flaming
unreasonableness
and
jealousy
and
the
sore
feeling
that
he
who
had
been
toiling
so
long
and
so
devotedly
in
the
heat
of
the
twinkler
sun
had
had
a
most
unfair
march
stolen
on
him
by
this
stranger
he
flamed
with
unreasonableness
yet
he
knew
this
was
the
solution
of
half
his
problem
and
of
much
the
worst
half
for
it
was
after
all
who
had
produced
the
uncomfortable
feeling
of
slipperiness
of
eels
had
been
quite
good
sitting
in
a
chair
crying
and
just
so
sweetly
needing
comfort
but
now
that
the
solution
was
presented
to
him
he
was
full
of
fears
for
on
what
now
could
he
base
his
proposal
to
elliott
would
be
the
legitimate
protector
of
both
the
twinklers
mr
twist
who
had
been
so
much
perturbed
by
the
idea
of
having
to
propose
to
one
or
other
twin
was
miserably
upset
by
the
realization
that
now
he
need
propose
to
either
elliott
had
cut
the
ground
from
under
his
feet
he
had
indeed
what
was
the
expression
he
used
the
evening
before
yes
nipped
in
there
was
now
no
necessity
for
to
marry
him
and
mr
twist
had
an
icy
and
forlorn
feeling
that
on
no
other
basis
except
necessity
would
she
he
was
it
was
all
very
well
for
elliott
to
get
proposing
to
people
of
seventeen
he
could
be
more
than
and
it
was
only
age
mr
twist
had
shaved
before
for
nothing
and
he
was
very
distinctly
aware
that
elliott
was
extremely
attractive
it
not
time
yet
to
talk
of
husbands
he
therefore
hotly
and
jealously
said
on
the
contrary
said
gently
it
not
only
time
but
the
war
i
have
observed
is
making
people
be
quick
and
sudden
about
all
sorts
of
things
you
have
observed
it
that
elliott
said
that
he
may
have
said
he
said
so
many
things
and
again
she
lapsed
into
contemplation
into
thought
mr
twist
as
he
gazed
jealously
at
her
profile
an
ineffable
ruminating
reminiscent
smugness
see
here
anna
he
said
finding
it
impossibly
painful
to
wait
while
she
contemplated
suppose
you
do
at
this
particular
crisis
fall
into
quite
so
many
ecstatic
meditations
there
is
as
much
time
as
you
seem
to
think
no
and
there
christopher
said
giving
herself
a
shake
and
with
that
slightly
troubled
look
coming
into
her
face
again
as
of
having
in
spite
of
being
an
angel
in
glory
somehow
got
her
feet
wet
precisely
said
mr
twist
getting
up
and
walking
about
the
room
there
christopher
now
christopher
i
should
say
would
be
pretty
well
over
this
but
that
so
unreasonable
said
with
gentle
deprecation
you
all
she
has
got
and
she
be
under
the
impression
the
remarkably
vivid
impression
that
she
losing
you
but
so
unreasonable
she
is
losing
me
it
sheer
gain
without
the
least
effort
or
bother
on
her
part
she
acquiring
a
oh
i
know
what
christopher
feels
said
mr
twist
going
up
and
down
the
room
quickly
i
know
right
enough
because
i
feel
it
all
myself
but
so
unreasonable
said
earnestly
why
should
two
of
you
be
feeling
things
that
are
she
has
always
regarded
herself
as
responsible
for
you
and
i
be
surprised
if
she
were
terribly
shocked
at
your
conduct
but
there
has
to
conduct
said
still
very
gentle
but
looking
as
though
her
feet
were
getting
wetter
i
do
see
how
anybody
is
ever
to
fall
in
love
unless
there
been
some
conduct
first
oh
do
argue
do
argue
you
ca
expect
not
to
mind
your
wanting
to
marry
a
perfect
stranger
a
man
she
has
even
seen
but
everybody
you
marry
started
by
being
a
perfect
stranger
and
somebody
you
had
ever
seen
said
oh
lord
if
only
you
would
exclaimed
mr
twist
and
as
for
your
aunt
in
england
what
she
going
to
say
to
this
sort
of
engagement
she
be
terribly
upset
and
knows
that
and
is
i
expect
nigh
worried
crazy
but
what
asked
have
aunts
to
do
with
love
then
she
said
very
earnestly
her
face
a
little
flushed
her
eyes
troubled
christopher
said
all
that
you
saying
now
and
a
lot
more
down
in
the
garden
before
i
came
to
you
and
i
said
what
i
been
saying
to
you
and
a
lot
more
but
she
would
listen
and
when
i
found
she
would
listen
i
tried
to
comfort
her
but
she
would
be
comforted
and
then
i
came
to
you
for
besides
wanting
to
tell
you
what
i
done
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
comfort
christopher
mr
twist
paused
a
moment
in
his
walk
yes
he
said
staring
at
the
carpet
yes
i
can
very
well
imagine
she
needs
it
but
i
do
suppose
anything
i
would
say
christopher
is
very
fond
of
you
said
gently
oh
yes
you
both
very
fond
of
me
said
mr
twist
pulling
his
mouth
into
a
crooked
and
unhappy
smile
we
love
you
said
simply
mr
twist
looked
at
her
and
a
mist
came
over
his
spectacles
you
dear
children
he
said
you
dear
dear
children
i
do
know
about
children
began
but
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
it
only
the
brandy
said
mr
twist
seeing
her
face
assume
the
expression
he
had
learned
to
associate
with
the
approach
of
bilton
take
it
away
please
bilton
he
called
out
and
put
it
on
the
bilton
however
did
take
anything
away
but
opened
the
door
an
inch
instead
there
someone
wants
to
speak
to
you
mr
twist
she
said
in
a
loud
whisper
thrusting
in
a
card
he
says
he
just
must
i
found
him
on
the
verandah
when
i
took
your
brandy
out
and
as
i
not
the
woman
to
leave
a
stranger
alone
with
good
brandy
i
brought
him
in
with
me
and
he
right
here
back
of
me
in
the
it
john
remarked
placidly
come
early
i
say
said
a
voice
behind
bilton
yes
nodded
getting
up
out
of
the
deep
chair
john
i
say
may
i
come
in
i
got
something
important
mr
twist
looked
at
would
you
rather
he
began
i
do
mind
john
she
said
softly
her
face
flooded
with
a
most
beautiful
light
mr
twist
opened
the
door
and
went
out
come
in
he
said
bilton
may
i
present
elliott
to
you
commander
elliott
of
the
british
navy
pleased
to
meet
you
commander
elliott

verandah

bring
it
to
you

here
no
thank

bilton
i
go
out
there
presently
perhaps
you

mind
waiting
for
me
there
i
do
suppose
elliott
will
want
to
keep
me
long
come
in
mr
elliott
and
having
disposed
of
bilton
who
was
in
a
particularly
willing
and
obedient
and
female
mood
he
motioned
elliott
into
the
office
there
stood
elliott
stopped
dead
this
is
fair
he
said
his
eyes
twinkling
and
dancing
what
is
inquired
gently
beaming
at
him
your
being
here
i
got
to
talk
business
look
here
sir
he
said
turning
to
mr
twist
could
talk
business
with
her
there
not
if
she
argued
said
mr
twist
argued
i
would
mind
her
arguing
it
just
her
being
there
got
to
talk
business
he
said
turning
to
business
about
marrying
you
and
how
can
i
with
you
standing
there
looking
like
well
like
that
i
do
know
said
placidly
not
moving
but
you
interrupt
just
your
being
there
will
interrupt
i
shall
see
you
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
it
be
impossible
not
to
i
mean
i
know
i
want
to
i
mean
my
dear
it
is
done
got
to
explain
all
sorts
of
things
to
your
guardian
he
is
my
guardian
corrected
the
accurate
gently
he
only
very
nearly
once
was
well
anyhow
i
got
to
explain
a
lot
of
things
that
take
some
time
and
it
is
so
much
explain
as
persuade
for
i
expect
he
said
turning
to
mr
twist
this
strikes
you
as
a
bit
sudden
sir
it
would
strike
anybody
said
mr
twist
trying
to
be
stern
but
finding
it
difficult
for
elliott
was
so
disarmingly
engaging
and
so
disarmingly
in
love
the
radiance
on
face
might
have
been
almost
a
reflection
caught
from
his
mr
twist
had
never
seen
two
people
look
so
happy
he
had
never
of
course
before
been
present
at
the
first
wonderful
dawning
of
love
the
whole
room
seemed
to
glow
with
the
surprise
of
it
there
you
see
said
elliott
again
appealing
to
who
stood
smiling
beatifically
at
him
without
moving
i
got
to
explain
that
it
is
after
all
as
mad
as
it
seems
and
that
i
a
fearfully
decent
chap
and
can
give
you
lots
to
eat
and
that
i
got
a
jolly
little
sister
here
who
respectable
and
besides
and
going
to
produce
references
to
back
up
these
assertions
and
proofs
that
i
perfectly
sound
in
health
except
for
my
silly
foot
which
health
but
just
foot
and
which
you
do
seem
to
mind
anyhow
and
how
i
ask
you
my
dear
am
i
to
do
any
of
this
with
you
standing
there
looking
like
well
like
that
i
do
know
said
again
still
not
moving
my
dear
he
said
wo
you
go
no
john
said
gently
his
eyes
twinkled
and
danced
more
than
ever
he
took
a
step
towards
her
then
checked
himself
and
looked
round
beseechingly
at
mr
twist
got
to
go
he
said
yes
said
mr
twist
and
i
guess
it
me
chapter
xxxviii
he
went
straight
in
search
of
he
was
going
to
propose
to
her
he
could
bear
it
he
could
bear
the
idea
of
his
previous
twins
his
blessed
little
twinklers
both
going
out
of
his
life
at
the
same
time
and
he
could
bear
after
what
he
had
just
seen
in
the
office
the
loneliness
of
being
left
outside
love
all
his
life
he
had
stood
on
the
outside
the
shut
door
of
love
he
had
had
no
love
neither
at
home
where
they
talked
so
much
about
it
and
there
was
any
nor
because
of
his
home
and
its
inhibitions
got
so
thoroughly
into
his
blood
anywhere
else
he
had
never
tried
to
marry
again
because
of
his
home
and
his
mother
and
the
whole
business
he
would
try
now
he
would
risk
it
it
was
awful
to
risk
it
but
it
was
more
awful
not
to
he
adored
how
nearly
the
afternoon
before
when
she
sat
crying
in
his
chair
had
he
taken
her
in
his
arms
why
he
would
have
taken
her
into
them
then
and
there
while
she
was
in
that
state
while
she
was
in
the
need
of
comfort
and
never
let
her
go
out
of
them
again
if
it
had
been
that
he
had
got
the
idea
so
firmly
fixed
in
his
head
that
she
was
a
child
fool
that
he
was
elliott
had
dispelled
that
idea
for
him
it
children
who
looked
as
had
looked
just
now
in
the
office
it
is
true
seemed
younger
than
but
that
was
because
she
was
little
and
easily
cried
he
loved
her
for
being
little
he
loved
her
because
she
easily
cried
he
yearned
and
hungered
to
comfort
to
pet
to
take
care
of
he
was
as
has
been
pointed
out
a
born
mother
avoiding
the
verandah
and
bilton
mr
twist
filled
with
recklessness
hurried
upstairs
and
knocked
at
door
no
answer
he
listened
dead
silence
he
opened
it
a
slit
and
peeped
in
emptiness
down
he
went
again
and
made
for
the
kitchen
because
li
koo
who
always
knew
everything
might
know
where
she
was
li
koo
did
he
jerked
his
head
towards
the
window
and
mr
twist
hurried
to
it
and
looked
out
there
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
was
the
cat
exactly
where
he
had
left
her
an
hour
before
and
kneeling
beside
her
stroking
her
stomach
was
she
had
her
back
to
the
house
and
her
face
was
hidden
the
sun
streamed
down
on
her
bare
head
and
on
the
pale
gold
rings
of
hair
that
frisked
round
her
neck
she
did
hear
him
till
he
was
close
to
her
so
much
absorbed
was
she
apparently
in
the
cat
and
when
she
did
she
did
look
up
but
bent
her
head
lower
than
before
and
stroked
more
assiduously
said
mr
twist
yes
come
and
talk
to
me
i
thinking
do
think
come
and
talk
to
me
little
little
dear
one
she
bent
her
head
lower
still
i
thinking
she
said
again
come
and
tell
me
what
you
thinking
i
thinking
about
cats
about
cats
said
mr
twist
uncertainly
yes
said
stroking
the
cat
stomach
faster
and
carefully
keeping
her
face
hidden
from
him
about
how
wise
and
wonderful
they
are
well
then
if
that
all
you
can
go
on
with
that
presently
and
come
and
talk
to
me
now
you
see
said
not
heeding
this
they
invariably
twins
and
more
than
twins
for
they
often
fours
and
sometimes
sixes
but
still
they
sit
in
the
sun
quietly
all
their
lives
and
do
mind
a
bit
what
their
what
their
twins
do
ah
said
mr
twist
now
i
getting
there
they
do
mind
a
bit
about
anything
they
just
clean
their
whiskers
and
they
purr
perhaps
it
that
that
comforts
them
perhaps
if
i
if
i
had
whiskers
and
a
and
a
purr
the
cat
leaped
suddenly
to
her
feet
and
shook
herself
violently
something
hot
and
wet
had
fallen
on
her
beautiful
stomach
made
a
little
sound
strangers
might
have
taken
for
a
laugh
as
she
put
out
her
arms
and
caught
her
again
but
it
was
a
sound
so
wretched
so
piteous
in
the
attempt
to
hide
away
from
him
that
mr
twist
heart
stood
still
oh
do
go
she
said
catching
at
the
cat
and
hugging
her
tight
i
ca
let
go
and
she
buried
her
face
in
her
fur
so
that
mr
twist
still
could
see
it
now
that
enough
about
the
cat
he
said
speaking
very
firmly
you
coming
with
me
and
he
stooped
and
picked
her
up
cat
and
all
and
set
her
on
her
feet
then
he
saw
her
face
good
god
he
exclaimed
i
did
try
not
to
show
you
she
said
and
she
added
taking
shelter
behind
her
pride
and
looking
at
him
as
defiantly
as
she
could
out
of
eyes
almost
closed
up
but
you
must
suppose
just
because
i
happen
to
to
seem
as
if
i
been
crying
that
i
that
i
minding
anything
oh
no
said
mr
twist
who
at
sight
of
her
face
had
straightway
forgotten
about
himself
and
his
longings
and
his
proposals
and
only
knew
that
he
must
comfort
christopher
oh
no
he
said
looking
at
her
aghast
i
not
supposing
we
minding
anything
either
of
us
he
took
her
by
the
arm
comfort
christopher
that
what
he
had
got
to
do
get
rid
as
quickly
as
possible
of
that
look
of
agony
yes
it
was
downright
agony
on
her
face
he
thought
he
guessed
what
she
was
thinking
and
feeling
he
thought
he
was
pretty
sure
she
was
thinking
and
feeling
that
her
beloved
columbus
had
gone
from
her
and
gone
to
a
stranger
in
a
day
in
a
few
hours
to
a
stranger
she
had
never
even
seen
never
even
heard
of
that
her
columbus
had
had
secrets
from
her
had
been
doing
things
behind
her
back
that
she
had
had
perfect
faith
and
trust
in
her
twin
and
now
was
tasting
the
dreadful
desolation
of
betrayal
and
he
also
guessed
that
she
must
be
sick
with
fears
for
he
knew
how
responsible
she
felt
how
seriously
she
took
the
charge
of
her
beautiful
twin
sick
with
fear
about
this
unknown
man
sick
with
the
feeling
of
helplessness
of
looking
on
while
columbus
rushed
into
what
might
well
be
for
all
any
one
knew
a
deadly
of
her
happiness
well
he
could
reason
her
out
of
most
of
this
he
felt
certainly
he
could
reassure
her
about
elliott
who
did
inspire
one
with
confidence
who
did
seem
anyhow
outwardly
a
very
fitting
mate
for
but
he
was
aghast
at
the
agony
on
her
face
all
that
he
guessed
she
was
thinking
and
feeling
did
justify
it
it
was
unreasonable
to
suffer
so
violently
on
account
of
what
was
after
all
a
natural
happening
but
however
unreasonable
it
was
she
was
suffering
he
took
her
by
the
arm
you
come
right
along
with
me
he
said
and
led
her
out
of
the
yard
away
from
li
koo
and
the
kitchen
window
towards
the
eucalyptus
grove
behind
the
house
you
come
right
along
with
me
he
repeated
holding
her
firmly
for
she
was
very
wobbly
on
her
feet
and
we
tell
each
other
all
about
the
things
we
not
minding
do
you
remember
when
the
left
liverpool
you
thought
i
thought
you
were
minding
things
then
and
were
very
angry
with
me
we
made
friends
since
have
we
and
we
are
going
to
mind
anything
ever
again
except
each
other
but
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
so
great
was
his
concern
and
distress
went
blindly
she
stumbled
along
helped
by
him
clutching
the
cat
she
could
see
out
of
her
swollen
eyes
her
foot
caught
in
a
root
and
the
cat
who
had
for
some
minutes
past
been
thoroughly
uneasy
became
and
struggled
out
of
her
arms
and
fled
into
the
wood
she
tried
to
stop
it
but
it
would
go
for
some
reason
this
broke
down
her
the
warm
cat
clutched
to
her
breast
had
at
least
been
something
living
to
hold
on
to
now
the
very
cat
had
gone
her
pride
collapsed
and
she
tumbled
against
mr
twist
arm
and
just
sobbed
if

that
moment

promptly
sat
her
down
on
the
grass
there

out
his
handkerchief

anxiously

up

face

but
everybody

said
mr

quoting
own
argument
the
one
that
had
especially
irritated
him
before
and
he
real
good
sure
of
it
and
you
be
sure
too
the
minute

side
properly

an
enormous
tear
i
got
him
just
in
time
before
he
trickled
into
your
ear
lord
how
sore
your
poor
little
eyes
are
do
it
even
cheer
you
to
think
you
going
to
be

oh

she
sobbed
her
face
not
a
whit
less
agonized
for
all
his
reassurances
well
i
know
i
wish
i
were
going
to
be
a
said
mr
twist
worried
by
his
inability
to
reassure
as
he
tenderly
and
carefully
dabbed
about
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
her
soaked
eyelashes
my
should
i
think
well
of
myself
then
his
hand
shook
i
wish
i
were
going
to
be
he
said
suddenly
impelled
perhaps
by
this
failure
to
get
rid
of
the
misery
in
her
face
to
hurl
himself
on
his
fate
not
get
your
mind
quite
clear
about
that
but
and
his
hand
shook
so
much
that
he
had
to
leave
off
drying
for
this
was
a
proposal
if
only
would
see
it
this
was
a
proposal
however
saw
nothing
even
in
normal
times
she
was
good
at
relationships
and
had
never
yet
understood
the
one
now
she
simply
hear
she
was
sitting
with
her
hands
limply
in
her
lap
and
sobbing
in
a
curious
sort
of
anguish
he
could
help
being
struck
by
it
there
was
more
in
this
than
he
had
grasped
again
he
forgot
himself
and
his
proposal
again
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
sole
desire
to
help
and
comfort
he
put
his
hand
on
the
two
hands
lying
with
such
an
air
of
being
forgotten
on
her
lap
what
is
it
he
asked
gently
little
dear
one
tell
me
it
clear
i
not
dead
on
to
it
yet
oh
columbus
she
seemed
to
writhe
in
her
misery
well
yes
yes
columbus
we
know
all
about
that
turned
her
quivering
face
to
him
oh
you
have
seen
you
do
see
it
only
me
that
seen
seen
what
what
have
i
seen
ah
do
cry
do
cry
like
that
oh
i
lost
her
lost
her
lost
her
because
she
marrying
lost
her
lost
her
sobbed
come
now
remonstrated
mr
twist
come
now
that
just
flat
contrary
to
the
facts
you
lost
nothing
and
you
gained
a
brother
oh
lost
her
lost
her
sobbed
come
come
now
said
mr
twist
helplessly
oh
she
sobbed
looking
at
him
out
of
her
piteous
eyes
has
nobody
thought
of
it
but
me
columbus
has
i
i
know
she
has
from
what
from
what
she
said
she
too
too
happy
to
think
but
you
thought
have
you
seen
that
she
be
english
now
really
english
and
go
away
from
me
to
england
with
him
and
i
i
ca
go
to
england
because
i
still
i
still
an
alien
enemy
and
so
i
lost
her
lost
her
lost
my
own
twin
and
dropped
her
head
on
to
her
knees
and
sobbed
in
an
abandonment
of
agony
mr
twist
sat
without
saying
or
doing
anything
at
all
he
had
thought
of
this
nor
he
was
sure
had
and
it
was
true
now
he
understood
face
and
the
despair
of
it
he
sat
looking
at
her
overwhelmed
by
the
realization
of
her
misfortune
for
a
moment
he
was
blinded
by
it
and
did
see
what
it
would
mean
for
him
then
he
did
see
he
almost
leaped
so
sudden
was
the
vision
and
so
luminous
he
said
his
voice
trembling
i
want
to
put
my
arm
round
you
that
because
i
love
you
and
if
you
let
me
do
that
i
could
tell
you
of
a
way
there
is
out
of
this
for
you
but
i
ca
tell
you
so
well
unless
unless
you
let
me
put
my
arm
round
you
first
he
waited
trembling
she
only
sobbed
he
could
even
be
sure
she
was
listening
so
he
put
his
arm
round
her
to
try
at
least
she
resist
so
he
drew
her
closer
she
did
resist
that
either
he
could
even
be
sure
she
knew
about
it
so
he
put
his
other
arm
round
her
too
and
though
he
could
be
sure
he
thought
he
hardly
dared
think
but
it
did
seem
as
if
she
nestled
happiness
such
as
in
his
lonely
loveless
life
he
had
never
imagined
flooded
mr
twist
he
looked
down
at
her
face
which
was
now
so
close
to
his
and
saw
that
her
eyes
were
shut
great
sobs
went
on
shaking
her
little
body
and
her
tears
now
that
he
was
wiping
them
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
unchecked
he
held
her
closer
to
him
close
to
his
heart
where
she
belonged
and
again
he
had
that
sensation
that
wonderful
sensation
of
nestling
little
blessed
the
way
out
is
so
simple
he
whispered
little
blessed
do
you
see
but
whether
saw
seemed
very
doubtful
there
was
only
that
feeling
as
to
which
he
was
no
doubt
mistaken
of
nestling
to
go
on
her
eyes
anyhow
remained
shut
and
her
body
continued
to
heave
with
sobs
he
bent
his
head
lower
his
voice
shook
it
so
so
simple
he
whispered
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
marry
me
and
as
she
made
an
odd
little
movement
in
his
arms
he
held
her
tighter
and
began
to
talk
very
fast
no
no
he
said
do
answer
anything
yet
just
listen
just
let
me
tell
you
first
i
want
to
tell
you
to
start
with
how
terribly
i
love
you
but
that
does
mean
you
got
to
love
me
you
need
if
you
do
want
to
if
you
ca
if
you
rather
not
i
eighteen
years
older
than
you
and
i
know
what
i
like
to
look
at
no
do
say
anything
yet
just
listen
quiet
first
but
if
you
married
me
you
be
an
american
right
away
do
you
see
just
as
is
going
to
be
english
and
i
always
intended
going
back
to
england
as
soon
as
may
be
and
if
you
married
me
what
is
to
prevent
your
coming
too
coming
to
england
with
and
her
husband
little
blessed
think
of
it
all
of
us
together
there
wo
be
any
aliens
in
that
quartette
i
guess
and
the
day
you
marry
me
you
be
done
with
being
german
for
good
and
all
and
do
you
get
supposing
it
matters
about
your
not
loving
me
because
you
see
i
love
you
so
much
i
adore
you
so
terribly
that
anyhow
there
be
more
than
enough
love
to
go
round
and
you
need
ever
worry
about
contributing
any
if
you
feel
like
it
mr
twist
broke
off
abruptly
what
say
he
said
for
was
making
definite
efforts
to
speak
she
was
also
making
definite
and
unmistakable
movements
and
this
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
she
was
coming
closer
what
say
said
mr
twist
breathlessly
bending
his
head
but
i
do
whispered
do
what
said
mr
twist
again
breathlessly
she
turned
her
face
up
to
his
on
it
was
the
same
look
he
had
lately
seen
on
shining
through
in
spite
of
the
disfiguration
of
her
tears
but
i
do
whispered
an
extraordinary
smile
an
sort
of
smile
coming
into
her
face
at
the
greatness
of
her
happiness
at
the
wonder
of
it
what
do
what
said
mr
twist
still
more
breathlessly
i
always
did
whispered
did
you
always
did
gasped
mr
twist
hardly
able
to
believe
it
and
yet
and
yet
there
on
her
little
face
on
her
little
transfigured
face
shone
the
same
look
oh
you
sighed
nestling
as
close
as
she
could
get
it
was
mr
twist
himself
who
got
on
a
ladder
at
five
minutes
past
four
that
afternoon
and
pasted
a
strip
of
white
paper
obliquely
across
the
sign
of
the
open
arms
with
the
word
shut
on
it
in
big
letters
li
koo
held
the
foot
of
the
ladder
mr
twist
had
only
remembered
the
imminence
of
four
and
the
german
inrush
a
few
minutes
before
the
hour
because
of
his
being
so
happy
and
when
he
did
he
flew
to
charcoal
and
paper
he
got
the
strip
on
only
just
in
time
a
car
drove
up
as
he
came
down
the
ladder
what
exclaimed
the
principal
male
occupant
of
the
car
pointing
thwarted
and
astonished
to
the
sign
shut
said
mr
twist
shut
shut
