father
scolded
mad

brothers
three
the
winds
might
blow
and
sisters
two
the
waters
flow
cried
and
cried
over
the
hills
as
off
he
flew
away
he
go
sore

was
the
sobbing
do
you
come
home
the
father
said
wild
wild
wild
was
his
race
until
you
can
stay
in
your
little
bed
only
the
woods
to
echo
his
footsteps
one
more
race
and
you
keep
away
only
the

swallowed
alive
or
hung
on
a
rail
or
dancing
along
the
waters
pale
or
running
or
walking
or
leaping
a
star
he
was
gone
so
long
and
he
went
so
far
that
the
winds
forgot
his
very
name
and
lost
to
memory
love
and
fame
he
became
in
verity
the
lost
hare
illustration

of
the
lost
hare
adventures
little
bossy
whitefoot
grazing
in
a
field
eating
all
the
green
grass
such
a
tender
yield
dreaming
of
the
days
when
she
would
be
a
cow
how
she
wished
that
very
time
would
come
just
now
she
shook
her
frisky
feet
and
wrinkled
up
her
nose
and
tossed
her
pretty
head
then
trotted
on
her
toes
when
looking
down
she
saw
two
frightened
eyes
and
there
the
hare
and
bossy
stood
in
mutual
surprise
i
sorry
i
have
scared
you
said
this
hare
considerate
good
bye
i
must
be
going
for
it
is
very
late
he
turned
him
on
his
long
legs
he
scuttled
thro
the
glade
he
held
his
head
as
if
forsooth
he
never
were
afraid
illustration

the
next
he
knew
with
accent
bold
a
dread
voice
cried
intruder
hold
i
butt
you
cried
a
goat
if
you
do
get
off
my
rock
the
hare
could
scarcely
breathe
so
frightful
was
the
shock
he
gasped
he
tried
to
utter
a
word
with
meaning
fraught
but
to
save
his
neck
he
control
a
single
thought
the
goat
was
tired
of
waiting
he
started
for
the
hare
only
to
find
a
vacant
place
only
to
stand
and
stare
for
a
flash
of
flying
feet
a
glimpse
of
a
gleaming
eye
was
all
that
marked
this
hero
who
rather
run
than
die
illustration

lost
hare
meets
the
goat
and
now
a
neigh
and
a
snort
tremendous
aroused
an
echo
most
stupendous
a
mustang
gay
a
mustang
free
looked
at
the
little
hare
carelessly
looked
then
curvetted
inviting
to
play
but
the
hare
almost
trembled
its
life
away
no
no
no
he
cried
in
wild
protesting
i
have
come
for
play
nor
any
jesting
ha
ha
laughed
the
mustang
and
then
hey
hey
and
kicking
up
his
heels
he
began
to
neigh
the
hare
stole
off
in
fact
he
ran
as
he
had
run
before
from
beast
or
man
he
tucked
under
fences
he
skipped
around
trees
he
did
pause
to
take
a
look
or
even
stop
to
sneeze
illustration

lost
hare
meets
the
mustang
when
a
horrible
bellow
a
wheeze
and
a
snort
came
close
to
his
ears
with
loudest
report
and
a
bull
most
furious
with
rage
not
spurious
dashed
up
with
a
curious
bow
and
a
stare
little
hare
panting
angry
bull
ranting
ah
what
a
race
oh
and
he
catch
him
then
he
despatch
him
pitiful
chase
was
a
escape
i
tell
you
true
i
have
given
a
dime
to
have
been
there
in
time
to
see
them
sweep
by
those
two

three
little
lambs
playing
in
clover
called
to
the
frightened
hare
over
and
over
come
with
us
into
this
pretty
pretty
spot
gasped
he
flying
past
i
rather
not
rather
not
indeed
each
lamb
rubbed
his
eye
then
stared
in
calm
disdain
to
see
him
onward
fly
he
may
then
all
exclaimed
in
accents
terse
go
further
if
he
cares
and
fare
much
worse
illustration

three
little
lambs
whish
whirr
on
his
track
fast
at
his
heels
comes
a
flying
pack
baying
snapping
howling
yelling
can
he
get
away
there
is
no
telling
fly
little
swift
feet
over
dale
and
hill
take
him
dashing
flashing
by
the
mill
tips
of
his
toes
twinkle
twinkle
fast
do
let
the
dogs
eat
him
up
at
last
do
let
the
hungry
cruel
cruel
jaws
snap
off
his
pretty
little
velvet
paws
tear
off
his
ears
in
terrible
sport
do
let
the
naughty
little
thing
be
caught
illustration

lost
hare
meets
the
pack
of
dogs
ah
a
hole
a
hole
in
he
goes
the
dogs
tumble
up
to
stare
at
his
toes
they
gnash
their
jaws
and
bewail
their
fate
but
to
eat
little
hare
must
wait
must
wait
illustration

conclusion
had
ever
a
beast
such
mad
career
such
a
race
such
a
long
long
chase
as
this
silly
little
hare
recorded
here
this
hare
who
would
stop
to
fight
who
ran
away
both
day
and
night
who
put
himself
delightedly
among
the
best
of
company
who
acting
soon
a
reckless
part
then
posted
off
with
all
his
heart
forever
he
compelled
to
roam
he
never
can
enjoy
a
home
hark
do
you
think
that
rustling
wind
oh
no
its
nothing
of
the
kind
it
this
poor
homeless
restless
hare
rushing
here
there
and
everywhere
list
do
you
hear
the
fall
in
gentle
shower
from
tall
oh
me
oh
my
it
poor
hare
pattering
by
by
the
light
of
the
silver
moon
moon
moon
he
runs
to
the
rhythm
of
a
dismal
tune
in
the
gay
merry
shine
of
a
summer
day
he
still
is
running
away
away
in
cold
in
heat
in
rain
in
snow
this
poor
little
creature
must
go
must
go
perhaps
if
you
there
in
time
you
see
this
wandering
hare
this
miserable
hare
rush
over
the
bleak
and
bare
do
you
suppose
he
wishes
his
home
to
see
his
sisters
two
and
his
brothers
three
would
he
like
to
lie
down
in
his
own
little
bed
and
does
he
recall
what
his
father
said
and
long
for
his
mother
to
tuck
him
up
tight
just
as
she
used
to
every
night
who
can
say
as
alway
he
goes
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
