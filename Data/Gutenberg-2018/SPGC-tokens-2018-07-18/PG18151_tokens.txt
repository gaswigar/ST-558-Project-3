i
do
like
this
he
said
in
another
and
entirely
different
language
i
know
chattel
slavery
an
established
custom
on
this
sector
and
we
have
to
conform
to
local
usages
but
it
sickens
me
to
have
to
haggle
with
these
swine
over
the
price
of
human
beings
on
the
zarkantha
sector
we
used
nothing
but
free
migratory
workers
the
guard
captain
said
humanitarian
considerations
aside
i
can
think
of
a
lot
better
ways
of
meeting
the
labor
problem
on
a
fruit
plantation
than
by
buying
slaves
you
need
for
three
months
a
year
and
have
to
feed
and
quarter
and
clothe
and
doctor
the
whole
twelve
twenty
hundreds
of
the
clerk
who
had
been
counting
the
money
said
that
is
the
payment
is
it
not
that
is
the
payment
the
slave
dealer
replied
the
clerk
swept
up
the
remaining
coins
and
his
companion
took
them
over
and
put
them
in
an
chest
snapping
the
padlock
the
two
guards
who
had
been
loitering
at
one
side
slung
their
rifles
and
picked
up
the
chest
carrying
it
into
the
plantation
house
the
slave
dealer
and
his
companion
arose
putting
their
money
into
a
leather
bag
turned
and
bowed
to
the
two
men
in
white
cloaks
the
slaves
are
yours
noble
lords
he
said
across
the
plantation
yard
six
more
men
in
striped
robes
with
carbines
slung
across
their
backs
approached
with
them
came
another
man
in
a
hooded
white
cloak
and
two
guards
in
blue
jackets
and
red
caps
with
bayoneted
rifles
the
man
in
white
and
his
armed
attendants
came
toward
the
house
the
six
calera
slavers
continued
across
the
yard
to
where
their
horses
were
picketed
if
i
do
not
offend
the
noble
lords
then
said
i
beg
their
sufferance
to
depart
i
and
my
men
have
far
to
ride
if
we
would
reach
careba
by
nightfall
the
lord
the
great
lord
the
lord
god
safar
watch
between
us
until
we
meet
again
urado
alatana
the
labor
foreman
came
up
onto
the
porch
as
the
two
slavers
went
down
have
a
good
look
at
them
radd
the
guard
captain
asked
you
think
i
crazy
enough
to
let
those
bandits
out
of
here
with
two
thousand
forty
thousand
paratemporal
exchange
units
of
the
company
money
without
knowing
what
we
getting
the
other
parried
they
all
right
nice
clean
lot
i
did
everything
but
take
them
apart
and
inspect
the
pieces
while
they
were
being
unshackled
at
the
stockade
i
like
to
know
where
this
got
them
though
they
not
local
stuff
lot
darker
and
they
jabbering
among
themselves
in
some
lingo
i
never
heard
before
a
few
are
wearing
some
rags
of
clothing
and
they
have
sandals
i
noticed
that
most
of
them
showed
marks
of
recent
whipping
that
may
mean
they
troublesome
or
it
may
just
mean
that
these
caleras
are
a
lot
of
sadistic
brutes
poor
devils
the
man
called
dosu
golan
was
evidently
hoping
that
he
never
catch
himself
talking
about
fellow
humans
like
that
the
guard
captain
turned
to
him
coming
to
have
a
look
at
them
doth
he
asked
you
go
kirv
i
see
them
later
still
not
able
to
look
the
company
property
in
the
face
the
captain
asked
gently
you
not
get
used
to
it
any
sooner
than
now
i
suppose
you
right
for
a
moment
dosu
golan
watched
and
his
followers
canter
out
of
the
yard
and
break
into
a
gallop
on
the
road
beyond
then
he
tucked
his
whip
under
his
arm
all
right
then
let
go
see
them
the
labor
foreman
went
into
the
house
the
manager
and
the
guard
captain
went
down
the
steps
and
set
out
across
the
yard
a
big
wagon
drawn
by
four
horses
driven
by
an
old
slave
in
a
blue
smock
and
a
thing
like
a
sunbonnet
rumbled
past
loaded
with
oranges
blue
woodsmoke
was
beginning
to
rise
from
the
stoves
at
the
open
kitchen
and
a
couple
of
slaves
were
noisily
chopping
wood
then
they
came
to
the
stockade
of
pointed
poles
a
guard
sergeant
in
a
blue
jacket
armed
with
a
revolver
met
them
with
a
salute
which
kiro
soran
returned
he
unfastened
the
gate
and
motioned
four
or
five
riflemen
into
positions
from
which
they
could
fire
in
between
the
poles
in
case
the
slaves
turned
on
their
new
owners
there
seemed
little
danger
of
that
though
kiro
soran
kept
his
hand
close
to
the
butt
of
his
revolver
the
slaves
an
even
hundred
of
them
squatted
under
awnings
out
of
the
sun
or
stood
in
line
to
drink
at
the
they
furtively
watched
the
two
men
who
had
entered
among
them
as
though
expecting
blows
or
kicks
when
none
were
forthcoming
they
relaxed
slightly
as
the
labor
foreman
had
said
they
were
clean
and
looked
healthy
they
were
all
nearly
naked
there
were
about
as
many
women
as
men
but
no
children
or
old
people
radd
right
the
captain
told
the
new
manager
they
not
local
much
darker
skins
and
different
faces
instead
of
oval
and
differently
shaped
noses
and
brown
eyes
instead
of
black
i
seen
people
like
that
somewhere
but
he
fell
silent
a
suspicion
utterly
fantastic
had
begun
to
form
in
his
mind
and
he
stepped
closer
to
a
group
of
a
the
manager
following
him
one
or
two
had
been
unmercifully
lashed
not
long
ago
and
all
bore
a
few
odd
sort
of
marks
more
like
than
welts
he
have
to
have
the
company
doctor
look
at
them
then
he
caught
their
speech
and
the
suspicion
was
converted
to
certainty
these
are
not
like
the
others
they
wear
fine
garments
and
walk
proudly
they
look
stern
but
not
cruel
they
are
the
real
masters
here
the
others
are
but
servants
he
grasped
the
manager
arm
and
drew
him
aside
you
know
that
language
he
asked
when
the
man
called
dosu
golan
shook
his
head
he
continued
that
kharanda
it
a
dialect
spoken
by
a
people
in
the
ganges
valley
in
india
on
the
kholghoor
sector
of
the
fourth
level
dosu
golan
blinked
and
his
face
went
blank
for
a
moment
you
mean
they
from
outtime
he
demanded
are
you
sure
i
did
two
years
on
fourth
level
kholghoor
with
the
paratime
police
before
i
took
this
job
the
man
called
kiro
soran
replied
and
another
thing
those
were
made
with
some
kind
of
an
electric
whip
not
these
rawhide
quirts
the
caleras
use
it
took
the
plantation
manager
all
of
five
seconds
to
add
that
up
the
answer
frightened
him
kirv
this
is
going
to
make
a
simply
hideous
uproar
all
the
way
up
to
home
time
line
main
office
he
said
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
well
i
know
what
i
have
to
do
the
captain
raised
his
voice
using
the
local
language
sergeant
run
to
the
guardhouse
and
tell
sergeant
adarada
to
mount
up
twenty
of
his
men
and
take
off
after
those
caleras
who
sold
us
these
slaves
they
headed
down
the
road
toward
the
river
tell
him
to
bring
them
all
back
and
especially
their
chief
and
him
i
want
alive
and
able
to
answer
questions
and
then
get
the
lord
urado
alatena
and
come
back
here
yes
captain
the
guards
were
all
yarana
people
they
disliked
caleras
intensely
the
sergeant
threw
a
salute
turned
and
ran
next
we
have
to
isolate
these
slaves
kiro
soran
said
better
make
a
full
report
to
the
company
as
soon
as
possible
going
to
transpose
to
police
terminal
time
line
and
make
my
report
to
the
subchief
then
now
wait
a
moment
kirv
dosu
golan
protested
after
all
i
the
manager
even
if
i
am
new
here
it
up
to
me
to
make
the
decisions
kiro
soran
shook
his
head
sorry
doth
not
this
one
he
said
you
know
the
terms
under
which
i
was
hired
by
the
company
i
still
a
field
agent
of
the
paratime
police
and
i
reporting
back
on
duty
as
soon
as
i
can
transpose
to
police
terminal
look
here
are
a
hundred
men
and
women
who
have
been
shifted
from
one
on
one
paratemporal
sector
of
probability
to
another
why
the
world
from
which
these
people
came
does
even
exist
in
this
continuum
there
only
one
way
they
could
have
gotten
here
and
that
the
way
we
did
in
a
paratemporal
transposition
field
you
can
carry
it
on
from
there
as
far
as
you
like
but
the
only
thing
it
adds
up
to
is
a
case
for
the
paratime
police
you
had
better
include
in
your
report
mention
that
reverted
to
police
status
my
company
pay
ought
to
be
stopped
as
of
now
and
until
somebody
who
outranks
me
is
sent
here
i
in
complete
charge
paratime
transposition
code
section
xvii
article
the
plantation
manager
nodded
kiro
soran
knew
how
he
must
feel
he
laid
a
hand
gently
on
the
younger
man
shoulder
you
understand
how
it
is
doth
this
is
the
only
thing
i
can
do
i
understand
kirv
count
on
me
for
absolutely
anything
he
looked
at
the
slaves
and
lines
of
horror
and
loathing
appeared
around
his
mouth
to
think
that
some
of
our
own
people
would
do
a
thing
like
this
i
hope
you
can
catch
the
devils
are
you
transposing
out
now
in
a
few
minutes
while
i
gone
have
the
doctor
look
at
those
those
things
could
get
infected
fortunately
he
one
of
our
own
people
yes
of
course
and
i
have
these
slaves
isolated
and
if
adarada
brings
back
and
his
gang
before
you
get
back
have
them
locked
up
and
waiting
for
you
i
suppose
you
want
to
and
question
the
whole
lot
slaves
and
slavers
the
labor
foreman
known
locally
as
urado
alatena
entered
the
stockade
what
wrong
kirv
he
asked
the
paratime
police
agent
told
him
briefly
the
labor
foreman
whistled
threw
a
quick
glance
at
the
nearest
slaves
and
nodded
i
knew
there
was
something
funny
about
them
he
said
doth
what
a
simply
beastly
thing
to
happen
two
days
after
you
take
charge
here
not
his
fault
the
paratime
police
agent
said
i
the
one
the
company
be
sore
at
but
i
rather
have
them
down
on
me
rather
than
old
tortha
karf
well
sit
on
the
lid
till
i
get
back
he
told
both
of
them
we
need
some
kind
of
a
story
for
the
locals
see
explain
to
the
guards
in
the
hearing
of
some
of
the
more
talkative
slaves
that
these
slaves
are
from
the
asian
mainland
that
they
are
of
a
people
friendly
to
our
people
and
that
they
were
kidnaped
by
pirates
our
enemies
that
ought
to
explain
everything
satisfactorily
on
his
way
back
to
the
plantation
house
he
saw
a
clump
of
local
slaves
staring
curiously
at
the
stockade
and
noticed
that
the
guards
had
unslung
their
rifles
and
fixed
their
bayonets
none
of
them
had
any
idea
of
course
of
what
had
happened
but
they
all
seemed
to
know
by
some
sort
of
esp
that
something
was
seriously
wrong
it
was
going
to
get
worse
too
when
strangers
began
arriving
apparently
from
nowhere
at
the
plantation
verkan
vall
waited
until
the
small
woman
across
the
circular
table
had
helped
herself
from
one
of
the
bowls
on
the
revolving
disk
in
the
middle
then
rotated
it
to
bring
the
platter
of
cold
around
to
himself
want
some
of
this
dalla
he
asked
transferring
a
slice
of
ham
and
a
spoonful
of
wine
sauce
to
his
plate
no
i
have
some
of
the
venison
the
girl
beside
him
said
and
some
of
the
pickled
beans
we
be
getting
our
fill
of
pork
for
the
next
month
i
thought
the
dwarma
sector
people
were
vegetarians
jandar
jard
the
theatrical
designer
said
most
nonviolent
peoples
are
they
well
the
dwarma
people
have
any
specific
taboo
against
taking
life

the
woman
in
the
brightly
colored
gown
told
him
they
just
utterly
noncombative
nonaggressive
when
i
was
on
the
dwarma
sector
there
was
a
horrible
scandal
at
the
village
where
i
was
staying
it
seems
that
a
farmer
and
a
meat
butcher
fought
over
the
price
of
a
pig
they
actually
raised
their
voices
and
shouted
contradictions
at
each
other
that
happened
two
years
before
and
people
were
still
talking
about
it
i
did
think
they
had
any

the
most
incompetent

saying

a
fine

the

no

said
when
somebody
does
something
wrong
his
neighbors
all
come
and
talk
to
him

then
they
all
forgive
him
and
have
a

they
lovely
people
so
kind
and
gentle
but
get
awfully
tired
of
them
in
about
a
month
they
have
absolutely
no
respect
for
anybody
privacy
in
fact
it
seems
slightly
indecent
to
them
for
anybody
to
want
privacy

title
a
girl
across
the
table
wearing
an
almost
transparent
gown
and
nothing
else
laughed
that
something
the
mavrad
of
mnirna
and
thalvabar
never
forgets
jandar
jard
drawled
with
what
in
a
woman
would
have
been
cattishness
thalvan
dras
gave
him
a
hastily
repressed
look
of
venomous
anger
then
said
something
more
to
verkan
vall
than
to
jandar
jard
about
titles
of
nobility
being
the
marks
of
social
position
and
responsibility
which
their
bearers
should
never
forget
that
jab
vall
thought
following
the
servant
out
of
the
room
had
been
a
mistake
on
part
a
for
which
he
had
designed
the
settings
was
due
to
open
here
in
dhergabar
in
another
ten
days
thalvan
dras
would
cherish
spite
and
a
word
from
the
mavrad
of
mnirna
and
thalvabar
would
set
a
dozen
critics
to
disparaging
jandar
work
on
the
other
hand
maybe
it
had
been
smart
of
jandar
jard
to
antagonize
thalvan
dras
for
every
critic
who
bowed
slavishly
to
the
wealthy
nobleman
there
were
at
least
two
more
who
detested
him
unutterably
and
they
would
rush
to
jandar
jard
defense
and
in
the
ensuing
uproar
the
settings
would
get
more
publicity
than
the
drama
itself
in
the
visiphone
booth
vall
found
a
girl
in
a
green
blouse
with
the
paratime
police
insigne
on
her
shoulder
looking
out
of
the
screen
the
wall
behind
her
was
pale
green
striped
in
gold
and
black
hello
eldra
he
greeted
her
hello
chief
assistant
i
sorry
to
bother
you
but
the
chief
wants
to
talk
to
you
just
a
moment
please
the
screen
exploded
into
a
kaleidoscopic
flash
of
lights
and
colors
then
cleared
again
this
time
a
man
looked
out
of
it
he
was
well
into
middle
age
close
to
his
three
hundredth
year
his
hair
a
uniform
was
beginning
to
thin
in
front
and
he
was
acquiring
the
beginnings
of
a
double
chin
his
name
was
tortha
karf
and
he
was
chief
of
paratime
police
and
verkan
vall
superior
hello

i
was
able
to
locate
you

from
this
luncheon
here
oh

an
hour
we
taking
a
rocket
to
zarabar
and
transposing
from

to
passenger
terminal

and
from
there
to
the
dwarma
sector
well
vall
i
hate
to
bother
you

this
tortha
karf

but
i
wish

by

on
your
way
to
the
rocketport
something

may
be
a
very
nasty
business
and
i
like
to
talk

well

let
me
remind
you
that
this

years

working
very
hard
and
you

entitled
to
a
little
time
together
i
just
want
you
to
look
into
something
before
you
leave
it
have
to
take
some
fast
looking
our
rocket
blasts
off
in
two
hours
it
may
take
a
little
longer
if
it
does
you
and
dalla
can
transpose
to
police
terminal
and
take
a
rocket
for
zarabar
equivalent
and
transpose
from
there
to
passenger
sixteen
it
would
save
time
if
you
brought
dalla
with
you
to
headquarters
dalla
wo
like
this
vall
understated
no
i
afraid
not
tortha
karf
looked
around
apprehensively
as
though
estimating
the
damage
an
enraged
hadron
dalla
could
do
to
his
office
furnishings
well
try
to
get
here
as
soon
as
you
can
thalvan
dras
was
holding
forth
when
vall
returned
on
one
of
his
favorite
preoccupations
reason
i
taking
such
an
especially
active
interest
in
this
year
arts
exhibitions
i
become
disturbed
at
the
extent
to
which
so
many
of
our
artists
have
been
content
to
derive
their
motifs
even
their
techniques
from
outtime
art
he
was
using
his
vocowriter
rather
than
his
conversational
voice
i
yield
to
no
one
in
my
appreciation
of
outtime
art
you
all
know
how
devotedly
i
collect
objects
of
art
from
all
over
paratime
but
our
own
artists
should
endeavor
to
express
their
artistic
values
in
our
own
artistic
idioms
vall
bent
over
his
wife
shoulder
we
have
to
leave
right
away
he
whispered
but
our
rocket
does
blast
off
for
two
hours
thalvan
dras
had
stopped
talking
and
was
looking
at
them
in
annoyance
i
have
to
go
to
headquarters
before
we
leave
it
save
time
if
you
come
along
oh
no
vall
she
looked
at
him
in
consternation
was
that
tortha
karf
calling
she
replaced
her
plate
on
the
table
and
got
to
her
feet
i
dreadfully
sorry
dras
he
addressed
their
host
i
just
had
a
call
from
tortha

few
minor
details
that
must
be
cleared
up
before

leave

time
line
if
you
accept
our
thanks
for
a
wonderful
luncheon
why
certainly
vall
brogoth

he
gave
a
slight
chuckle
i
so
used
to
having
brogoth
zaln
at
my
elbow
that
forgotten
he
was
here
wait
i
call
one
of
the
servants

we

an
aircab
vall
told
him
but
you
simply
ca
take
a
public
cab
the
nobleman
was
shocked
at
such
an
obscene
idea
i
will
have
a
car
ready
for
you
in
a
few
minutes
sorry
dras
we
have
to
hurry
we
get
a
cab
on
the
roof
everybody
sorry
to
have
to
break
away
like
this
see
you
all
when
we
get
back
hadron
dalla
watched
dejectedly
as
the
green
crags
and
escarpments
of
the
paratime
building
loomed
above
the
city
in
front
of
them
and
began
slipping
under
the
aircab
she
felt
like
a
prisoner
recaptured
at
the
moment
when
attempted
escape
was
about
to
succeed
i
knew
it
she
said
i
knew
he
find
something
he
trying
to
break
things
up
between
us
the
way
he
did
twenty
years
ago
vall
crushed
out
his
cigarette
and
said
nothing
that
had
been
true
and
she
knew
it
as
well
as
he
did
there
had
been
many
other
factors
involved
in
the
disintegration
of
their
previous
marriage
most
of
them
of
her
own
contribution
but
that
had
been
twenty
years
ago
she
told
herself
this
time
it
would
be
different
if
only
really
vall
he
never
liked
me
she
went
on
he
jealous
of
me
i
think
you
to
be
his
successor
when
he
retires
and
he
thinks
i
not
a
good
influence
oh
rubbish
dalla
the
chief
has
always
liked
you
vall
replied
if
he
did
do
you
think
he
always
be
inviting
us
to
that
farm
of
his
on
fifth
level
sicily
it
just
that
this
job
of
ours
has
no
end
something
always
turning
up
outtime
the
music
that
the
cab
had
been
playing
died
away
paratime
building
just
below
it
said
in
a
light
feminine
voice
which
landing
stage
please
vall
leaned
forward
and
punched
at
the
buttons
in
front
of
him
something
in
the
cab
electronic
brain
gave
a
rapid
series
of
clicks
as
it
shifted
from
the
general
paratime
building
beam
to
the
beam
of
the
paratime
police
landing
stage
then
it
said
thank
you
the
building
below
seemed
to
rotate
upward
toward
them
as
it
settled
down
then
the
snapped
off
the
cab
door
popped
open
and
the
cab
said
now
ride
with
me
again
sometime
they
crossed
the
landing
stage
entered
the
antigrav
shaft
and
floated
downward
at
the
end
of
a
hallway
below
vall
opened
the
door
of
tortha
karf
office
and
ushered
her
through
ahead
of
him
tortha
karf
inside
the
semicircle
of
his
desk
was
speaking
into
a
recording
phone
as
they
approached
he
shut
off
the
machine
and
waved
a
cigarette
in
his
hand
come
on
back
and
sit
down
he
invited
be
with
you
in
a
moment
then
he
switched
on
the
phone
again
and
went
on
talking
something
about
prompter
evaluation
and
transmission
of
reports
and
less
reliance
on
robot
equipment
sign
that
up
my
personal
order
and
see
it
transmitted
to
everybody
down
to
and
including
sector
regional
subchief
level
he
finished
then
hung
up
the
phone
and
turned
to
them
sorry
about
this
he
said
sit
down
if
you
please
cigarettes
she
shook
her
head
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
behind
the
desk
she
started
to
relax
and
then
caught
herself
and
sat
erect
her
hands
on
her
lap
this
wo
interfere
with
your
vacation
vall
tortha
karf
was
saying
i
just
need
a
little
help
before
you
transpose
out
we
have
to
catch
the
rocket
for
zarabar
in
an
hour
and
a
half
dalla
reminded
him
do
worry
about
that
if
you
miss
the
commercial
rocket
our
police
rockets
can
give
it
an
hour
start
and
pass
it
before
it
gets
to
zarabar
tortha
karf
said
then
he
turned
to
vall
here
happened
he
said
one
of
our
field
agents
on
detached
duty
as
guard
captain
for
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
on
a
fruit
plantation
in
western
north
america
third
level
esaron
sector
was
looking
over
a
lot
of
slaves
who
had
been
sold
to
the
plantation
by
a
local
slave
dealer
he
heard
them
talking
among
themselves
in
kharanda
dalla
caught
the
significance
of
that
before
vall
did
at
first
she
was
puzzled
then
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
horrified
and
angry
tortha
karf
was
explaining
to
vall
just
where
and
on
what
paratemporal
sector
kharanda
was
spoken
no
possibility
that
this
agent
skordran
kirv
could
have
been
mistaken
he
worked
for
a
while
on
kholghoor
sector
himself
knew
the
language
by
and
by
two
years
use
tortha
karf
was
saying
so
he
ordered
himself
back
on
duty
had
the
slaves
isolated
and
the
slave
dealers
arrested
and
then
transposed
to
police
terminal
to
report
the
secreg
subchief
old
vulthor
tharn
confirmed
him
in
charge
at
this
esaron
sector
plantation
and
assigned
him
a
couple
of
detectives
and
a
psychist
when
was
this
vall
asked
yesterday
day
about
local
time
hundred
dhergabar
time
vall
commented
yes
and
i
just
found
out
about
it
came
in
in
the
late
morning
generalized
very
inconspicuous
item
no
special
urgency
symbol
or
anything
fortunately
one
of
the
report
editors
spotted
it
and
messaged
police
terminal
for
a
copy
of
the
original
report
it
been
a
long
time
since
we
had
anything
like
that
vall
said
studying
the
glowing
tip
of
his
cigarette
his
face
wearing
the
curiously
withdrawn
expression
of
a
conscious
memory
recall
fifty
years
ago
the
time
that
gang
kidnaped
some
girls
from
second
level
triplanetary
empire
sector
and
sold
them
into
the
harem
of
some
fourth
level
sultan
yes
that
was
your
first
independent
case
vall
that
was
when
i
began
to
think
you
really
make
a
cop
one
renegade
first
level
citizen
and
four
or
five
servsec
prole
hoodlums
with
a
stolen
conveyer
this
looks
like
a
rather
more
ambitious
operation
dalla
got
one
of
her
own
cigarettes
out
and
lit
it
vall
and
tortha
karf
were
talking
cop
talk
about
method
of
operation
and
possible
size
of
the
gang
involved
and
why
the
slaves
had
been
shipped
all
the
way
from
india
to
the
west
coast
of
north
america
always
ready
sale
for
slaves
on
the
esaron
sector
vall
was
saying
and
so
many
small
independent
states
and
different
languages
that
outtimers
would
be
particularly
conspicuous
and
with
this
barbarian
invasion
going
on
on
the
kholghoor
sector
slaves
could
be
picked
up
cheaply
tortha
karf
added
in
spite
of
her
determination
to
boycott
the
conversation
curiosity
began
to
get
the
better
of
her
she
had
spent
a
year
and
a
half
on
the
kholghoor
sector
investigating
alleged
psychic
powers
of
the
local
priests
there
been
nothing
to
it
the
prophecies
precognition
they
were
shrewd
inferences
and
the
miracles
psychokinesis
they
were
she
found
herself
asking
what
barbarian
invasion
this
oh
central
asian
nomadic
people
the
croutha
tortha
karf
told
her
they
came
down
through
khyber
pass
about
three
months
ago
turned
east
and
hit
the
headwaters
of
the
ganges
without
punching
a
lot
of
buttons
to
find
out
exactly
i
say
they
halfway
to
the
delta
country
by
now
leader
seems
to
be
a
chieftain
called
llamh
droogh
the
red
a
lot
of
paratime
trading
companies
are
yelling
for
permits
to
introduce
firearms
in
the
kholghoor
sector
to
protect
their
holdings
there
she
nodded
the
fourth
level
kholghoor
sector
belonged
to
what
was
known
as
basic
probability
of
civilization
having
developed
late
on
the
indian
subcontinent
with
the
rest
of
the
world
including
europe
in
stone
age
savagery
or
early
bronze
age
barbarism
the
kharandas
the
people
among
whom
she
had
once
done
work
had
developed
a
handcraft
culture
she
could
imagine
the
roads
jammed
with
fugitives
from
the
barbarian
invaders
the
conveyer
hidden
among
the
trees
the
lurking
slavers
watch
it
dalla
do
let
the
old
scoundrel
play
on
your
feelings
well
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
chief
vall
was
asking
well
i
have
to
know
just
what
this
situation
likely
to
develop
into
and
i
want
to
know
why
vulthor
tharn
been
sitting
on
this
ever
since
skordran
kirv
reported
it
to
him
i
can
answer
the
second
one
now
vall
replied
vulthor
tharn
is
due
to
retire
in
a
few
years
he
has
a
negatively
good
undistinguished
record
he
trying
to
play
it
safe
tortha
karf
nodded
that
what
i
thought
look
vall
suppose
you
and
dalla
transpose
from
here
to
police
terminal
and
go
to
novilan
equivalent
and
give
this
a
quick
and
report
to
me
and
then
rocket
to
zarabar
equivalent
and
go
on
with
your
trip
to
the
dwarma
sector
it
may
delay
you
eight
or
ten
hours
but
closer
vall
said
i
have
to
transpose
to
this
plantation
on
the
esaron
sector
how
about
it
dalla
would
you
want
to
do
that
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
angry
with
him
he
did
want
to
refuse
and
he
was
trying
to
make
her
do
it
for
him
i
know
it
a
confounded
imposition
dalla
tortha
karf
told
her
but
it
important
that
i
get
a
prompt
and
full
estimate
of
the
situation
this
may
be
something
very
serious
if
it
an
isolated
incident
it
can
be
handled
in
a
routine
manner
but
i
afraid
not
it
has
all
the
marks
of
a
operation
and
if
this
is
a
matter
of
mass
kidnapings
from
one
sector
and
transpositions
to
another
you
can
see
what
a
threat
this
is
to
the
paratime
secret
moral
considerations
entirely
aside
vall
said
we
do
need
to
discuss
them
they
too
obvious
she
nodded
for
over
twelve
millennia
the
people
of
her
race
and
vall
and
tortha
karf
had
been
existing
as
parasites
on
all
the
innumerable
other
worlds
of
alternate
probability
on
the
lateral
dimension
of
time
smart
parasites
never
injure
their
hosts
and
try
never
to
reveal
their
existence
we
could
do
that
could
we
vall
she
asked
angry
at
herself
now
for
giving
in
and
if
you
want
to
question
these
slaves
i
speak
kharanda
and
i
know
how
they
think
and
i
a
qualified
and
licensed
technician
well
that
splendid
dalla
tortha
karf
enthused
wait
a
moment
i
message
police
terminal
to
have
a
rocket
ready
for
you
i
need
a
for
kharanda
myself
vall
said
dalla
do
you
know
acalan
when
she
shook
her
head
he
turned
back
to
tortha
karf
look
it
about
a
rocket
hop
to
novilan
equivalent
say
we
have
the
machines
installed
in
the
rocket
dalla
and
i
can
take
our
language
lessons
on
the
way
and
be
ready
to
go
to
work
as
soon
as
we
land
good
idea
tortha
karf
approved
i
order
that
done
right
away
now
oddly
enough
she
was
feeling
so
angry
now
that
she
had
committed
herself
and
vall
come
to
think
of
it
she
had
never
been
on
police
terminal
time
line
very
few
people
outside
the
paratime
police
ever
had
and
she
had
always
wanted
to
learn

work
and
participate
in

with
him
and
if
she
made
him
refuse
it
would
have
been
something
ugly
between
them
all
the
time
they
would
be
on
the
dwarma
sector
but
this
way
the
big
circular
conveyer
room
was
crowded
as
it
had
been
every
minute
of
every
day
for
the
past
ten
thousand
years
at
the
great
circular
desk
in
the
center
departing
or
returning
police
officers
were
checking
in
or
out
with
the
cylindrical
robot
clerks
or
talking
to
human
attendants
some
were
in
the
regulation
green
uniform
others
like
himself
were
in
civilian
clothes
more
were
in
outtime
costumes
from
all
over

and

and

the

there
were
priestly
vestments
stiff
with
gold
and
military
uniforms
there
were
trousers
and
jackboots
and
bare
legs
blasters
and
swords
and
pistols
and
bows
and
quivers
and
spears
and
the
place
was
loud
with
a
babel
of
voices
and
the
clatter
of
teleprinters
illustration
dalla
was
looking
about
her
in
surprised
delight
for
her
the
vacation
had
already
begun
he
was
glad
for
a
while
he
had
been
afraid
that
she
would
be
unhappy
about
it
he
guided
her
through
the
crowd
to
the
desk
spoke
for
a
while
to
one
of
the
human
attendants
and
found
out
which
was
their
conveyer
it
was
a
shuttler
operative
only
between
home
time
line
and
police
terminal
from
which
most
of
the
paratime
police
operations
were
routed
he
put
dall
in
through
the
sliding
door
followed
and
closed
it
behind
him
locking
it
then
before
he
closed
the
starting
switch
he
drew
a
pistollike
weapon
and
checked
it
in
theory
the
paratemporal
transposition
field
was
uninfluenced
by
material
objects
outside
it
in
practice
however
such
objects
occasionally
intruded
and
sometimes
they
were
alive
and
hostile
the
last
time
he
had
been
in
this
conveyer
room
he
had
seen
a
quartet
of
returning
officers
emerge
from
a
conveyer
dome
dragging
a
dead
lion
by
the
tail
the
needler
which
he
carried
was
the
only
weapon
which
could
be
used
under
the
circumstances
it
had
no
effect
whatever
on
any
material
structure
and
could
be
used
inside
an
activated
conveyer
without
deranging
the
as
say
a
bullet
or
the
vibration
of
an
ultrasonic
paralyzer
would
do
and
it
was
instantly
fatal
to
anything
having
a
central
nervous
system
it
was
a
good
weapon
to
use
outtime
for
that
reason
also
even
on
the
most
civilized
the
most
elaborate
autopsy
would
reveal
no
specific
cause
of
death
what
the
esaron

years
ago
a

they
began
working
with
nuclear
energy
and
developed
spaceships

they
concentrated
so
on
the
inorganic

and
so
far
neglected

they
launched
their

knew
what
it
was
and
before
the
epidemic
ended
it
had
almost
depopulated
this
planet
since
the
survivors
knew
nothing
about
germs
they
blamed
it
on
the
anger
of
the

old

finally
the

entered
to

the

i
fix

already
asleep
when
the
pilot
was
adjusting
his
helmet
and
giving
him
his
injection
he
never
felt
the
rocket
tilt
into
firing
position
and
while
he
slept
the
kharands
language
with
all
its
vocabulary
and
grammar
became
part
of
his
subconscious
knowledge
needing
only
the
mental
pronunciation
of

bring
it
into

the
pilot
was
already
unfastening
and
raising
his

when
he
opened
his

dalla
beside
him
was
sipping
a
cup
of
spiced
wine
on
the
landing
stage
of
the

at
novilan

four
or
five
people
were
waiting
for

vall
recognized
the
subchief
vulthor
tharn
who
introduced
another
man
in
riding
boots
and
a
white
cloak
as
skordran
kirv
vall
clasped
hands
with
him
warmly
good
work
agent
skordran
you
got
onto
this
promptly
i
tried
to
sir
do
you
want
the
dope
now
we
have
half
an
flight
to
our
spatial
equivalent
and
another
half
hour
in
transposition
give
it
to
me
on
the
way
he
said
and
turned
to
vulthor
tharn
our
esaron
costumes
ready
yes
over
there
in
the
control
tower
we
have
a
temporary
conveyer
head
set
up
about
two
hundred
miles
south
of
here
which
will
take
you
straight
through
to
the
plantation
suppose
you
change
now
dalla
he
said
subchief
i
like
a
word
with
you
privately
he
and
vulthor
tharn
excused
themselves
and
walked
over
to
the
edge
of
the
landing
stage
the
secreg
subchief
was
outwardly
composed
but
vall
sensed
that
he
was
worried
and
embarrassed
now
what
been
done
since
you
got
agent
skordran
report
vall
asked
well
sir
it
seems
that
this
is
more
serious
than
we
had
anticipated
field
agent
skordran
who
will
give
you
the
particulars
says
that
there
is
every
indication
that
a
large
and
gang
of
paratemporal
criminals
our
own
people
are
at
work
he
says
that
he
found
evidence
of
activities
on
fourth
level
kholghoor
that
do
agree
with
any
information
we
have
about
conditions
on
that
sector
beside
transmitting
agent
skordran
report
to
dhergabar
through
the
robot
what
have
you
done
about
it
i
confirmed
agent
skordran
in
charge
of
the
local
investigation
and
gave
him
two
detectives
and
a
psychist
sir
as
soon
as
we
could
furnish
indoctrination
in
kharanda
to
other
psychists
i
sent
them
along
he
now
has
four
of
them
and
eight
detectives
by
that
time
we
had
a
conveyer
head
right
at
this
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
plantation
why
did
you
just
borrow
psychists
from
secreg
for
kholghoor
eastern
india
vall
asked
subchief
ranthar
would
have
loaned
you
a
few
oh
i
could
call
on
another
secreg
for
men
without
authorization
especially
not
from
another
sector
organization
even
another
level
authority
vulthor
tharn
said
beside
it
would
have
taken
longer
to
bring
them
here
than
our
own
personnel
he
was
right
about
the
second
point
vall
agreed
mentally
however
his
real
reason
was
procedural
did
you
alert
ranthar
jard
to
what
was
going
on
in
his
secreg
he
asked
gracious
no
vulthor
tharn
was
scandalized
i
have
no
authority
to
tell
people
of
equal
echelon
in
other
sector
and
level
organizations
what
to
do
i
put
my
report
through
regular
channels
it
was
my
place
to
go
outside
my
own
jurisdiction
and
his
report
had
crawled
through
channels
for
fourteen
hours
vall
thought
well
on
my
authority
and
in
the
name
of
chief
tortha
you
message
ranthar
jard
at
once
send
him
every
scrap
of
information
you
have
on
the
subject
and
forward
additional
information
as
it
comes
in
to
you
i
doubt
he
find
anything
on
any
that
being
exploited
by
any
legitimate
paratimers
this
gang
probably
work
exclusively
on
unpenetrated
this
business
skordran
kirv
came
across
was
a
bad
blunder
on
some
underling
part
he
saw
dalla
emerge
from
the
control
tower
in
breeches
and
boots
and
a
white
cloak
buckling
on
a
heavy
revolver
i
go
change
now
you
get
busy
calling
ranthar
jard
i
see
you
when
i
get
back
are
you
taking
over
chief
assistant
skordran
kirv
asked
as
the
aircar
lifted
from
the
landing
stage
not
at
all
my
wife
and
i
are
starting
on
our
vacation
as
soon
as
i
find
out
what
been
happening
here
and
report
to
chief
tortha
did
your
native
troopers
catch
those
slavers
yes
they
got
them
yesterday
afternoon
we
had
them
ever
since
do
you
want
the
whole
thing
just
as
it
happened
assistant
verkan
or
just
a
condensation
give
me
what
you
think
it
indicates
remembering
that
you
probably
trying
to
analyze
a
large
situation
from
a
very
small
sample
it
big
all
right
skordran
kirv
said
this
gang
ca
number
less
than
a
hundred
men
maybe
several
hundred
they
must
have
at
least
two
conveyers
and
several
small
ones
and
bases
on
what
sounds
like
some
fifth
level
time
line
and
at
least
one
air
freighter
of
around
five
thousand
tons
they
are
operating
on
a
number
of
kholghoor
and
esaron
time
lines
verkan
vall
nodded
i
did
think
it
was
any
petty
larceny
he
said
wait
till
you
hear
the
rest
of
it
on
the
kholghoor
sector
this
gang
is
known
as
the
wizard
traders
we
been
using
that
as
a
convenience
label
they
pose
as
sorcerers
black
robes
and
covered
with
luminous
symbols
auras
mechanical
magic
tricks
that
sort
of
thing
they
have
all
the
croutha
scared
witless
their
procedure
is
to
establish
camps
in
the
forest
near
recently
conquered
kharanda
cities
then
they
appear
to
the
croutha
impress
them
with
their
magical
powers
and
trade
manufactured
goods
for
kharanda
captives
they
mainly
trade
firearms
apparently
some
kind
of
flintlocks
and
powder
then
they
were
confining
their
operations
to
unpenetrated
time
lines
there
had
been
no
reports
of
firearms
in
the
hands
of
the
croutha
invaders
after
they
buy
a
batch
of
slaves
skordran
kirv
continued
they
transpose
them
to
this
presumably
fifth
level
base
where
they
have
concentration
camps
the
slaves
we
questioned
had
been
airlifted
to
north
america
where
there
another
concentration
camp
and
from
there
transposed
to
this
esaron
sector
time
line
where
i
found
them
they
say
that
there
were
at
least
two
to
three
thousand
slaves
in
this
north
american
concentration
camp
and
that
they
are
being
transposed
out
in
small
batches
and
replaced
by
others
airlifted
in
from
india
this
lot
was
sold
to
a
calera
named
the
chieftain
of
a
hill
town
careba
about
fifty
miles
of
the
plantation
there
were
two
hundred
and
fifty
in
this
batch
this
only
bought
the
batch
he
sold
at
the
plantation
the
aircar
lost
speed
and
altitude
below
the
countryside
was
dotted
with
conveyer
heads
each
spatially
coexistent
with
some
outtime
police
post
or
operation
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
the
western
coast
of
north
america
was
a
center
of
civilization
on
many
paratemporal
sectors
and
while
the
conveyer
heads
of
the
commercial
and
passenger
companies
were
scattered
over
hundreds
of
fifth
level
time
lines
those
of
the
paratime
police
were
concentrated
upon
one
the
circled
around
a
steel
tower
that
supported
a
conveyer
head
spatially
coexistent
with
one
on
a
top
floor
of
some
outtime
tall
building
and
let
down
in
front
of
a
low
prefabricated
steel
shed
a
man
in
police
uniform
came
out
to
meet
them
there
was
a
conveyer
dome
inside
and
a
circle
that
marked
the
transposition
point
of
an
outtime
conveyer
they
all
entered
the
dome
and
the
operator
put
on
the
transposition
field
you
have
heard
the
worst
of
it
yet
skordran
kirv
was
saying
on
this
time
line
we
have
reason
to
think
that
the
native
who
bought
the
slaves
actually
saw
the
conveyer
maybe
even
saw
it
activated
if
he
did
we
either
have
to
capture
him
and
give
him
a
or
kill
him
vall
said
what
do
you
know
about
him
well
this
careba
the
town
he
bosses
is
a
little
walled
town
up
in
the
hills
everybody
there
is
related
to
everybody
else
this
man
we
have
is
the
son
of
a
sister
of
wife
they
all
bandits
and
slavers
and
cattle
rustlers
and
what
have
you
for
the
last
ten
years
has
been
buying
slaves
from
some
secret
source
before
the
kholghoor
sector
people
began
coming
in
they
were
mostly
white
with
a
few
brown
people
who
might
have
been
polynesians
no
negroes
there
no
black
race
on
this
sector
and
i
suppose
the
paratime
slavers
did
want
too
many
questions
asked
under
said
that
they
were
all
outlanders
speaking
strange
languages
ten
years
and
this
is
the
first
hint
we
had
of
it
vall
said
that
not
a
bright
mark
for
any
of
us
i
bet
the
slave
population
on
some
of
these
esaron
time
lines
is
an
anthropologist
nightmare
why
if
this
has
been
going
on
for
ten
years
there
must
have
been
millions
upon
millions
of
people
dragged
from
their
own
time
lines
into
slavery
dalla
said
in
a
shocked
voice
ten
years
may
not
be
all
of
it
vall
said
this
looks
like
the
only
tangible
lead
we
have
at
present
how
does
he
operate
about
once
every
ten
days
he
take
ten
or
fifteen
men
and
go
a
day
ride
that
may
be
as
much
as
fifty
miles
these
caleras
have
good
horses
and
they
hard
riders
into
the
hills
he
take
a
big
bag
of
money
all
gold
after
dark
when
he
has
made
camp
a
couple
of
strangers
in
calera
dress
will
come
in
he
go
off
with
them
and
after
about
an
hour
he
come
back
with
eight
or
ten
of
these
strangers
and
a
couple
of
hundred
slaves
always
chained
in
batches
of
ten
pays
for
them
makes
arrangements
for
the
next
meeting
and
the
next
morning
he
and
his
party
start
marching
the
slaves
to
careba
i
might
add
that
until
now
these
slaves
have
been
sold
to
the
mines
east
of
careba
these
are
the
first
that
have
gotten
into
the
coastal
country
that
why
this
has
come
to
light
before
then
the
conveyer
comes
in
every
ten
days
at
about
the
same
place
yes
i
been
thinking
of
a
way
we
might
trap
them
skordran
kirv
said
i
need
more
men
and
equipment
order
them
from
regional
or
general
reserve
vall
told
him
this
thing
going
to
have
overtop
priority
till
it
cleared
up
he
was
mentally
cursing
vulthor
tharn
timidity
as
the
conveyer
flickered
and
solidified
around
them
and
the
overhead
red
light
turned
green
they
emerged
into
the
interior
of
a
long
shed
and
with
small
barred
windows
set
high
above
the
earth
floor
it
was
cool
and
shadowy
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
fragrance
of
citrus
fruits
there
were
bins
along
the
walls
some
partly
full
of
oranges
and
piles
of
wicker
baskets
another
conveyer
dome
stood
beside
the
one
in
which
they
had
arrived
two
men
in
white
cloaks
and
riding
boots
sat
on
the
edge
of
one
of
the
bins
smoking
and
talking
skordran
kirv
introduced
them
gathon
dard
and
krador
arv
special
detectives
and
asked
if
anything
new
had
come
up
krador
arv
shook
his
head
we
still
have
about
forty
to
go
he
said
nothing
new
in
their
stories
still
the
same
two
time
lines
illustration
these
people
skordran
kirv
explained
were
all
peons
on
the
estate
of
a
kharanda
noble
just
above
the
big
bend
of
the
ganges
the
croutha
hit
their
master
estate
about
a
ago
elapsed
time
in
telling
about
their
capture
most
of
them
say
that
their
master
wife
killed
herself
with
a
dagger
after
the
croutha
killed
her
husband
but
about
one
out
of
ten
say
that
she
was
kidnaped
by
the
croutha
two
different
time
lines
of
course
the
ones
who
tell
the
suicide
story
saw
no
firearms
among
the
croutha
the
ones
who
tell
the
kidnap
story
say
that
they
all
had
some
kind
of
muskets
and
pistols
we
making
synthetic
summaries
of
the
two
stories
we
having
trouble
with
the
locals
about
all
these
strangers
coming
in
gathon
dard
added
they
getting
curious
we
have
to
take
a
chance
on
that
vall
said
are
the
interrogations
still
going
on
then
let
have
a
at
them
the
big
double
doors
at
the
end
of
the
shed
were
barred
on
the
inside
krador
arv
unlocked
a
small
side
door
letting
vall
dalla
and
gathon
dard
out
in
the
yard
outside
a
gang
of
slaves
were
unloading
a
big
wagon
of
oranges
and
packing
them
into
hampers
they
were
guarded
by
a
couple
of
native
riflemen
who
seemed
mostly
concerned
with
keeping
them
away
from
the
shed
and
a
man
in
a
white
cloak
was
watching
the
guards
for
the
same
purpose
he
walked
over
and
introduced
himself
to
vall
golzan
doth
local
alias
dosu
golan
i
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
manager
here
nasty
business
for
you
people
vall
sympathized
if
it
any
consolation
it
a
bigger
headache
for
us
have
you
any
idea
what
going
to
be
done
about
these
slaves
golzan
doth
asked
i
have
to
remember
that
the
company
has
forty
thousand
paratemporal
exchange
units
invested
in
them
the
top
office
was
very
specific
in
requesting
information
about
that
vall
shook
his
head
that
over
my
echelon
he
said
have
to
be
decided
by
the
paratime
commission
i
doubt
if
your
company
suffer
you
bought
them
innocently
in
conformity
with
local
custom
ever
buy
slaves
from
this
before
i
new
here
the
man
i
replacing
broke
his
neck
when
his
horse
put
a
foot
in
a
gopher
hole
about
two
ago
beside
him
vall
could
see
dalla
nod
as
though
making
a
mental
note
when
she
got
back
to
home
time
line
she
put
a
crew
of
mediums
to
work
trying
to
contact
the
discarnate
former
plantation
manager
at
rhogom
institute
she
had
been
working
on
the
problem
of
return
of
a
discarnate
personality
from
outtime
a
few
times
skordran
kirv
said
nothing
suspicious
all
local
stuff
we
questioned
pretty
closely
on
that
point
and
he
says
that
this
is
the
first
time
he
ever
brought
a
batch
of
outlanders
this
far
west
the
interrogations
were
being
conducted
inside
the
plantation
house
in
the
secret
central
rooms
where
the
paratimers
lived
skordran
kirv
used
a
to
slide
open
a
hidden
door
i
suppose
i
do
have
to
warn
either
of
you
that
any
positive
statement
made
in
the
hearing
of
a
subject
he
began
has
the
effect
of
hypnotic
suggestion
vall
picked
up
after
him
and
should
be
avoided
unless
such
suggestion
is
intended
dalla
finished
skordran
kirv
laughed
opening
another
inner
door
and
stood
aside
in
what
had
been
the
paratimers
recreation
room
most
of
the
furniture
had
been
shoved
into
the
corners
four
small
tables
had
been
set
up
widely
spaced
and
with
screens
between
across
each
of
them
with
an
electric
recorder
between
an
almost
naked
kharanda
slave
faced
a
paratime
police
psychist
at
a
long
table
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
four
men
and
two
girls
were
working
over
stacks
of
cards
and
two
big
charts
phrakor
vuln
the
man
who
was
working
on
the
charts
introduced
himself
synthesist
he
introduced
the
others
vall
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
dalla
was
his
wife
in
case
any
of
the
cops
began
to
get
ideas
and
mentioned
that
she
spoke
kharanda
had
spent
some
time
on
the
fourth
level
kholghoor
and
was
a
qualified
psychist
what
have
you
got
so
far
he
asked
two
different
time
lines
and
two
different
gangs
of
wizard
traders
phrakor
vuln
said
we
established
the
latter
from
physical
descriptions
and
because
both
batches
were
sold
by
the
croutha
at
equivalent
periods
of
elapsed
time
vall
picked
up
one
of
the
cards
and
glanced
at
it
i
notice
there
a
fair
verbal
description
of
these
firearms
and
mention
of
electric
whips
he
said
i
curious
about
where
they
came
from
well
this
is
how
we
reconstructed
them
chief
assistant
one
of
the
girls
said
handing
him
a
couple
of
sheets
of
white
drawing
paper
the
sketches
had
been
done
with
soft
pencil
they
bore
repeated
erasures
and
corrections
that
of
the
whip
showed
a
cylindrical
handle
indicated
as
twelve
inches
in
length
and
one
in
diameter
fitted
with
a
that
definitely
second
level
khiftan
vall
said
handing
it
back
made
of
braided
copper
or
silver
wire
and
powered
with
a
little
battery
in
the
grip
they
heat
up
to
about
two
hundred
centigrade
produce
really
painful
burns
why
that
beastly
dalla
exclaimed
anything
on
the
khiftan
sector
is
skordran
kirv
looked
at
the
four
slaves
at
the
tables
we
do
have
a
really
bad
case
here
now
a
few
of
these
people
were
horribly
though
vall
was
looking
at
the
other
sketches
one
was
a
musket
with
a
wide
butt
and
a
stock
the
vaguely
flintlock
had
been
dotted
in
tentatively
the
other
was
a
long
pistol
similarly
definite
in
outline
and
vague
in
mechanical
detail
it
was
merely
a
miniature
of
the
musket
i
seen
firearms
like
these
have
a
lot
of
them
in
my
collection
he
said
handing
back
the
sketches
mechanical
or
cultures
fact
is
things
like
those
could
have
been
made
on
the
kholghoor
sector
if
the
kharandas
had
learned
to
combine
sulfur
carbon
and
nitrates
to
make
powder
the
interrogator
at
one
of
the
tables
had
evidently
heard
all
his
subject
could
tell
him
he
rose
motioning
the
slave
to
stand
now
go
with
that
man
he
said
in
kharanda
motioning
to
one
of
the
detectives
in
native
guard
uniform
you
will
trust
him
he
is
your
friend
and
will
not
harm
you
when
you
have
left
this
room
you
will
forget
everything
that
has
happened
here
except
that
you
were
kindly
treated
and
that
you
were
given
wine
to
drink
and
your
hurts
were
anointed
you
will
tell
the
others
that
we
are
their
friends
and
that
they
have
nothing
to
fear
from
us
and
you
will
not
try
to
remove
the
mark
from
the
back
of
your
left
hand
as
the
detective
led
the
slave
out
a
door
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
psychist
came
over
to
the
long
table
handing
over
a
card
and
lighting
a
cigarette
suicide
story
he
said
to
one
of
the
girls
who
took
the
card
anything
new
some
minor
details
about
the
sale
to
the
caleras
on
this
time
line
i
think
we
about
scraped
bottom
you
ca
say
that
phrakor
vuln
objected
the
very
last
one
may
give
us
something
nobody
else
had
noticed
another
subject
was
sent
out
the
interrogator
came
over
to
the
table
one
of
the
crowd
he
said
this
one
was
right
beside
that
croutha
who
took
the
shot
at
the
wild
pig
or
whatever
it
was
on
the
way
to
the
wizard
traders
camp
best
description
of
the
guns
we
gotten
so
far
no
question
that
they
flintlocks
he
saw
verkan
vall
oh
hello
assistant
verkan
what
do
you
make
of
them
you
an
authority
on
outtime
weapons
i
understand
i
have
to
see
them
these
people
simply
do
think
mechanically
enough
to
give
a
good
description
a
lot
of
peoples
make
flintlock
firearms
he
started
running
over
in
his
mind
the
paratemporal
areas
in
which
gunpowder
but
not
the
was
known
expanding
cultures
which
had
progressed
as
far
as
the
former
but
not
the
latter
static
cultures
in
which
an
accidental
discovery
of
gunpowder
had
never
been
followed
up
by
further
research
cultures
in
which
a
few
stray
bits
of
ancient
knowledge
had
survived
another
interrogator
came
over
and
then
the
fourth
for
a
while
they
sat
and
talked
and
drank
coffee
and
then
the
next
quartet
of
slaves
two
men
and
two
women
were
brought
in
one
of
the
women
had
been
badly
blistered
by
the
electric
whips
of
the
wizard
traders
in
spite
of
reassurances
all
were
visibly
apprehensive
we
will
not
harm
you
one
of
the
psychists
told
them
here
here
is
medicine
for
your
hurts
at
first
it
will
sting
as
good
medicines
will
but
soon
it
will
take
away
all
pain
and
here
is
wine
for
you
to
drink
a
couple
of
detectives
approached
making
a
great
show
of
pouring
wine
and
applying
ointment
under
cover
of
the
medication
they
jabbed
each
slave
with
a
hypodermic
needle
and
then
guided
them
to
seats
at
the
four
tables
vall
and
dalla
went
over
and
stood
behind
one
of
the
psychists
who
had
a
small
flashlight
in
his
hand
now
rest
for
a
while
the
psychist
was
saying
rest
and
let
the
good
medicine
do
its
work
you
are
tired
and
sleepy
look
at
this
magic
light
which
brings
comfort
to
the
troubled
look
at
the
light
look
at
the
light
they
moved
to
the
next
table
did
you
have
hand
in
the
fighting
no
lord
we
were
peasant
folk
not
fighting
people
we
had
no
weapons
nor
those
who
fought
were
all
killed
we
held
up
empty
hands
and
were
spared
to
be
captives
of
the
croutha
what
happened
to
your
master
the
lord
ghromdour
and
to
his
lady
one
of
the
croutha
threw
a
hatchet
and
killed
our
master
and
then
his
lady
drew
a
dagger
and
killed
herself
the
psychist
made
a
red
mark
on
the
card
in
front
of
him
and
circled
the
number
on
the
back
of
the
slave
hand
with
red
indelible
crayon
vall
and
dalla
went
to
the
third
table
they
had
the
common
weapons
of
the
croutha
lord
and
they
also
had
the
weapons
of
the
wizard
traders
of
these
they
carried
the
long
weapons
slung
across
their
backs
and
the
short
weapons
thrust
through
their
belts
a
blue
mark
on
the
card
a
blue
circle
on
the
back
of
the
hand
they
listened
to
both
versions
of
what
had
happened
at
the
sack
of
the
lord
ghromdour
estate
and
the
march
into
the
captured
city
of
jhirda
and
the
second
march
into
the
forest
to
the
camp
of
the
wizard
traders
the
servants
of
the
wizard
traders
did
not
appear
until
after
the
croutha
had
gone
away
they
wore
different
garb
they
wore
short
jackets
and
trousers
and
short
boots
and
they
carried
small
weapons
on
their
belts
they
had
whips
of
great
cruelty
that
burned
like
fire
we
were
all
lashed
with
these
whips
as
you
may
see
lord
the
croutha
had
bound
us
two
and
two
with
these
the
servants
of
the
wizard
traders
took
off
from
us
and
they
chained
us
together
by
tens
with
the
chains
we
still
wore
when
we
came
to
this
place
they
killed
my
child
my
little
zhouzha
the
woman
with
the
horribly
blistered
back
was
wailing
they
tore
her
out
of
my
arms
and
one
of
the
servants
of
the
wizard
traders
may
khokhaat
devour
his
soul
forever
dashed
out
her
brains
and
when
i
struggled
to
save
her
i
was
thrown
on
the
ground
and
beaten
with
the
until
i
fainted
then
i
was
dragged
into
the
forest
along
with
the
others
who
were
chained
with
me
she
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
sobbing
bitterly
dalla
stepped
forward
taking
the
flashlight
from
the
interrogator
with
one
hand
and
lifting
the
woman
head
with
the
other
she
flashed
the
light
quickly
in
the
woman
eyes
you
will
grieve
no
more
for
your
child
she
said
already
you
are
forgetting
what
happened
at
the
wizard
traders
camp
and
remembering
only
that
your
child
is
safe
from
harm
soon
you
will
remember
her
only
as
a
dream
of
the
child
you
hope
to
have
some
day
she
flashed
the
light
again
then
handed
it
back
to
the
psychist
now
tell
us
what
happened
when
you
were
taken
into
the
forest
what
did
you
see
there
the
psychist
nodded
approvingly
made
a
note
on
the
card
and
listened
while
the
woman
spoke
she
had
stopped
sobbing
now
and
her
voice
was
clear
and
cheerful
vall
went
over
to
the
long
table
those
slaves
were
still
chained
with
the
wizard
traders
chains
when
they
were
delivered
here
where
are
the
chains
he
asked
skordran
kirv
in
the
permanent
conveyer
room
skordran
kirv
said
you
can
look
at
them
there
we
did
want
to
bring
them
in
here
for
fear
these
poor
devils
would
think
we
were
going
to
chain
them
again
they
very
light
very
strong
some
kind
of
alloy
steel
files
and
power
saws
only
polish
them
it
takes
fifteen
seconds
to
cut
a
link
with
an
atomic
torch
one
long
chain
and
short
lengths
fifteen
inches
long
staggered
every
three
feet
with
a
single
for
the
ankle
the
shackles
were
riveted
with
soft
rivets
evidently
made
with
some
sort
of
a
power
we
cut
them
easily
with
a
cold
chisel
they
ought
to
be
sent
to
dhergabar
equivalent
police
terminal
for
study
of
material
and
workmanship
now
you
mentioned
some
scheme
you
had
for
capturing
this
conveyer
that
brings
in
the
slaves
for
what
have
you
in
mind
we
still
have
and
all
his
gang
under
hypno
thought
of
giving
them
hypnotic
conditioning
and
sending
them
back
to
careba
with
orders
to
put
out
some
kind
of
signal
the
next
time
starts
out
on
a
buying
trip
we
could
have
a
couple
of
men
posted
in
the
hills
overlooking
careba
and
they
could
send
a
through
to
police
terminal
then
a
party
could
be
sent
with
a
mobile
conveyer
to
ambush
on
the
way
and
wipe
out
his
party
our
people
could
take
their
horses
and
clothing
and
go
on
to
take
the
conveyer
by
surprise
i
suggest
one
change
instead
of
relying
on
visual
signals
by
the
send
a
couple
of
our
men
to
careba
with
midget
radios
skordran
kirv
nodded
sure
we
can
condition

help

it
be
a
lot

long
hadron
skordran
kirv
told
her
once
we
capture
one
of
their
conveyers
the
instrument
panel
tell
us
what
time
line
they
working
from
and
then
we
have
them
there
an
sector
parable
about
a
snake
charmer
who
thought
he
was
picking
up
his
snake
and
found
that
he
had
hold
of
an
elephant
tail
vall
said
that
might
be
a
good
thing
to
bear
in
mind
till
we
find
out
just
what
we
have
picked
up
illustration
coming
down
a
hallway
on
the
hundred
and
seventh
floor
of
the
management
wing
of
the
paratime
building
yandar
yadd
paused
to
admire
in
the
green
mirror
of
the
glassoid
wall
the
jaunty
angle
of
his
cap
the
fit
of
his
short
jacket
and
the
way
his
weapon
hung
at
his
side
this
last
was
not
instantly
recognizable
as
a
weapon
it
looked
more
like
a
portable
radio
which
indeed
it
was
it
was
none
the
less
a
potent
weapon
one
flick
of
his
finger
could
connect
that
radio
with
one
at
news
service
and
within
the
hour
anything
he
said
into
it
would
be
heard
by
all
terra
mars
and
venus
in
consequence
there
existed
around
the
paratime
building
a
marked
and
understandable
reluctance
to
antagonize
yandar
yadd
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
twenty
minutes
short
of
when
he
had
an
appointment
with
baltan
vrath
the
comptroller
general
glancing
about
he
saw
that
he
was
directly
in
front
of
the
doorway
of
the
outtime
claims
bureau
and
he
strolled
in
walking
through
the
waiting
room
and
into
the
office
at
once
he
stiffened
like
a
bird
dog
at
point
sphabron
larv
one
of
his
young
legmen
was
in
altercation
across
the
with
varkar
klav
the
deputy
claims
agent
on
duty
at
the
time
varkar
was
trying
to
be
icily
dignified
sphabron
larv
black
hair
was
in
disarray
and
his
face
was
suffused
with
anger
he
was
pounding
with
his
fist
on
the
plastic
you
have
to
he
was
yelling
in
the
older
man
face
that
a
public
document
and
i
have
a
right
to
see
it
you
want
me
to
go
into
tribunes
court
and
get
an
order
if
i
do
there
be
a
question
in
council
about
why
i
had
to
before
the
day
out
what
the
matter
larv
yandar
yadd
asked
lazily
he
trying
to
hold
something
out
on
you
sphabron
larv
turned
his
eyes
lit
happily
when
he
saw
his
boss
and
then
his
anger
returned
i
want
to
see
a
copy
of
an
indemnity
claim
that
was
filed
this
morning
he
said
varkar
here
wo
show
it
to
me
what
does
he
think
this
is
a
fourth
level
dictatorship
what
kind
of
a
claim
now
yandar
yadd
addressed
larv
ignoring
varkar
klav
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
one
of
the
thalvan
interests
companies
just
claimed
forty
thousand
for
a
hundred
slaves
bought
by
one
of
their
plantation
managers
on
third
level
esaron
from
a
local
slave
dealer
the
paratime
police
impounded
the
slaves
for
interrogation
and
then
transposed
the
lot
of
them
to
police
terminal
yandar
yadd
still
held
his
affectation
of
sleepy
indolence
now
why
would
the
paracops
do
that
i
wonder
slavery
an
established
local
practice
on
esaron
sector
our
people
have
to
buy
slaves
if
they
want
to
run
a
plantation
i
know
that
sphabron
larv
replied
that
what
i
want
to
find
out
there
must
be
something
wrong
either
with
the
slaves
or
the
treatment
our
people
were
giving
them
or
the
paratime
police
and
i
want
to
find
out
which
to
tell
the
truth
larv
so
do
i
yandar
yadd
said
he
turned
to
the
man
behind
the
counter
varkar
do
we
see
that
claim
or
do
i
make
a
story
out
of
your
refusal
to
show
it
he
asked
the
paratime
police
asked
me
to
keep
this
confidential
varkar
klav
said
publicity
would
seriously
hamper
an
important
police
investigation
yandar
yadd
made
an
impolite
noise
how
do
i
know
that
all
it
would
do
would
be
to
reveal
police
incompetence
he
retorted
look
varkar
you
and
the
paratime
police
and
the
paratime
commission
and
the
home
time
line
management
are
all
hired
employees
of
the
home
time
line
public
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
what
its
employees
are
doing
and
it
my
business
to
see
that
they
informed
now
for
the
last
time
will
you
show
us
a
copy
of
that
claim
well
let
me
explain
off
the
record
the
official
begged
i
had
that
gag
worked
on
me
when
i
was
about
larv
age
fifty
years
ago
anything
i
get
i
put
on
the
air
or
not
at
my
own
discretion
all
right
varkar
klav
surrendered
pointing
to
a
reading
screen
and
twiddling
a
knob
but
when
you
read
it
i
hope
you
have
enough
discretion
to
keep
quiet
about
it
the
screen
lit
and
yandar
yadd
automatically
pressed
a
button
for
a
the
two
newsmen
stared
for
a
moment
and
then
even
yandar
yadd
shell
of
drowsy
negligence
cracked
and
fell
from
him
his
hand
brushed
the
switch
as
he
snatched
the
from
his
belt
marva
he
barked
before
the
girl
at
the
news
office
could
more
than
acknowledge
get
this
recorded
for
immediate
telecast
ready
beginning
the
existence
of
a
huge
paratemporal
slave
trade
came
to
light
on
the
afternoon
of
day
on
a
time
line
of
the
third
level
esaron
sector
when
field
agent
skordran
kirv
paratime
police
discovered
at
an
orange
plantation
of
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
salgath
trod
sat
alone
in
his
private
office
his
lunch
growing
cold
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
as
he
watched
the
teleview
screen
across
the
room
tuned
to
a
pickup
behind
the
speaker
chair
in
the
executive
council
chamber
ten
stories
below
the
two
thousand
seats
had
been
almost
all
empty
at
when
council
had
convened
fifteen
minutes
later
the
news
had
broken
now
at
a
good
three
quarters
of
the
seats
were
occupied
he
could
see
in
the
aisles
the
robot
pages
gliding
back
and
forth
receiving
and
delivering
messages
one
had
just
slid
up
to
the
seat
of
councilman
hasthor
flan
and
hasthor
was
speaking
urgently
into
the
recorder
mouthpiece
another
message
for
him
he
supposed
he
gotten
at
least
a
score
such
calls
since
the
crisis
had
developed
people
were
going
to
start
wondering
he
thought
this
situation
should
have
been
perfect
for
his
purposes
as
leader
of
the
opposition
he
could
easily
make
himself
the
next
general
manager
if
he
exploited
this
scandal
properly
he
listened
for
a
while
to
the
member
who
was
speaking
he
could
rip
that
fellow
arguments
to
shreds
in
a
hundred
words
but
he
did
dare
the
management
was
taking
exactly
the
line
salgath
trod
wanted
the
whole
council
to
take
treat
this
affair
as
an
isolated
and
extraordinary
occurrence
find
a
couple
of
convenient
scapegoats
cobble
up
some
explanation
acceptable
to
the
public
and
forget
it
he
wondered
what
had
happened
to
the
imbecile
who
had
transposed
those
kholghoor
sector
slaves
onto
an
exploited
time
line
ought
to
be
shanghaied
to
the
khiftan
sector
and
sold
to
the
priests
of
fasif
a
buzzer
sounded
and
for
an
instant
he
thought
it
would
be
the
message
he
had
seen
hasthor
fan
recording
then
he
realized
that
it
was
the
buzzer
for
the
private
door
which
could
only
be
operated
by
someone
with
a
special
identity
sign
he
pressed
a
button
and
unlocked
the
door
the
young
man
in
the
loose
tunic
who
entered
was
a
stranger
at
least
his
face
and
his
voice
were
strange
but
voices
could
be
mechanically
altered
and
a
skilled
cosmetician
could
render
any
face
unrecognizable
he
looked
like
a
student
or
a
minor
commercial
executive
or
an
engineer
or
something
like
that
of
course
his
tunic
bulged
slightly
under
the
left
armpit
but
even
the
most
respectable
tunics
showed
occasional
good
afternoon
councilman
the
newcomer
said
sitting
down
across
the
desk
from
salgath
trod
i
was
just
talking
to
somebody
we
both
know
salgath
trod
offered
cigarettes
lighted
his
visitor
and
then
his
own
what
does
our
mutual
friend
think
about
all
this
he
asked
gesturing
toward
the
screen
our
mutual
friend
is
at
all
happy
about
it
you
think
perhaps
that
i
bursting
into
wild
huzzas
salgath
trod
asked
if
i
were
to
act
as
everybody
expects
me
to
i
be
down
there
on
the
floor
now
clawing
into
the
management
tooth
and
nail
all
my
adherents
are
wondering
why
i
not
so
are
all
my
opponents
and
before
long
one
of
them
is
going
to
guess
the
reason
well
why
not
go
down
the
stranger
asked
our
mutual
friend
thinks
it
would
be
an
excellent
idea
the
leak
could
be
stopped
and
gone
so
far
already
that
the
management
will
never
be
able
to
play
it
down
so
the
next
best
thing
is
to
try
to
exploit
it
salgath
trod
smiled
mirthlessly
so
i
am
to
get
in
front
of
it
and
lead
it
in
the
right
direction
fine
as
long
as
i
do
stumble
over
something
if
i
do
it
go
over
me
like
a
fifth
level
do
worry
about
that
the
stranger
laughed
reassuringly
there
are
others
on
the
floor
who
are
also
friends
of
our
mutual
friend
here
what
you
better
do
is
attack
the
paratime
police
especially
tortha
karf
and
verkan
vall
accuse
them
of
negligence
and
incompetence
and
by
implication
of
collusion
and
demand
a
special
committee
to
investigate
and
try
to
get
a
motion
for
a
confidence
vote
passed
a
motion
to
censure
the
management
say
salgath
trod
nodded
it
would
delay
things
at
least
and
if
our
mutual
friend
can
keep
properly
covered
i
might
be
able
to
overturn
the
management
he
looked
at
the
screen
again
that
old
fool
of
a
nanthav
is
just
getting
started
it
be
an
hour
before
i
could
get
recognized
plenty
of
time
to
get
a
speech
together
something
short
and
vicious
you
have
to
be
careful
it
wo
do
with
your
political
record
to
try
to
play
down
these
stories
of
a
gigantic
criminal
conspiracy
that
too
close
to
the
management
line
and
at
the
same
time
you
want
to
avoid
saying
anything
that
would
get
verkan
vall
and
tortha
karf
started
off
on
any
new
lines
of
investigation
salgath
trod
nodded
just
depend
on
me
i
handle
it
after
the
stranger
had
gone
he
shut
off
the
sound
reception
relying
on
visual
to
keep
him
informed
of
what
was
going
on
on
the
council
floor
he
did
like
the
situation
it
was
too
easy
to
say
the
wrong
thing
if
only
he
knew
more
about
the
shadowy
figures
whose
messengers
used
his
private
door
held
his
aching
head
in
both
hands
as
though
he
were
afraid
it
would
fall
apart
and
blinked
in
the
sunlight
from
the
window
lord
safar
how
much
of
that
sweet
brandy
had
he
drunk
last
night
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
for
a
moment
trying
to
think
then
suddenly
apprehensive
he
thrust
his
hand
under
his
pillow
the
heavy
pistols
were
there
all
right
but
money
he
rummaged
frantically
among
the
bedding
and
among
his
clothes
piled
on
the
floor
but
the
leather
bag
was
nowhere
to
be
found
two
thousand
gold
the
price
of
a
hundred
slaves
he
snatched
up
one
of
the
pistols
his
headache
forgotten
then
he
laughed
and
tossed
the
pistol
down
again
of
course
he
given
the
bag
to
the
plantation
manager
what
was
his
outlandish
name
dosu
golan
to
keep
for
him
before
the
drinking
bout
had
begun
it
was
safely
waiting
for
him
in
the
plantation
strong
box
well
nothing
like
a
good
scare
to
make
a
man
forget
a
brandy
head
anyhow
and
there
was
something
else
something
very
nice
oh
yes
there
it
was
beside
the
bed
he
picked
up
the
beautiful
gleaming
repeater
pulled
down
the
lever
far
enough
to
draw
the
cartridge
halfway
out
of
the
chamber
and
closed
it
again
lowering
the
hammer
those
two
jeseru
traders
from
the
north
what
were
their
names
ganadara
and
atarazola
that
was
a
stroke
of
luck
meeting
them
here
they
given
him
this
lovely
rifle
and
they
were
going
to
accompany
him
and
his
men
back
to
careba
they
had
a
hundred
such
rifles
and
two
hundred
revolvers
and
they
wanted
to
trade
for
slaves
the
lord
safar
bless
them
both
would
they
be
welcome
at
careba
he
looked
at
the
sunlight
falling
through
the
window
on
the
still
recumbent
form
of
his
companion
outside
he
could
hear
the
sounds
of
the
plantation
coming
to
life
an
ax
thudding
on
wood
the
clatter
of
pans
from
the
kitchens
crossing
to
bed
he
grasped
the
sleeper
by
the
ankle
tugging
waken
faru
he
shouted
get
up
and
clear
the
fumes
from
your

today
faru
swore
groggily
and
pushed
himself
into
a
sitting
position
fumbling
on
the
floor
for
his
trousers
what
day
this
he
asked
the
day
after
we
went
to
bed
ninny
then
wrinkled
his
brow
he
could
remember
clearly
enough
the
sale
of
the
slaves
but
after
that
oh
well
he
been
drinking
it
would
all
come
back
to
him
after
a
while
verkan
vall
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
face
wearily
started
to
light
another
cigarette
and
threw
it
across
the
room
in
disgust
what
he
needed
was
a
drink
a
long
drink
of
cool
tart
white
wine
laced
with
brandy
and
then
he
needed
to
sleep
we
absolutely
nowhere
ranthar
jard
said
of
course
operating
on
time
lines
we
never
penetrated
the
fact
that
supplying
the
croutha
with
guns
proves
that
there
is
a
firearm
on
any
of
the
time
lines
our
people
are
legitimately
exploiting
and
there
are
only
about
three
billion
time
lines
on
this
belt
of
the
croutha
invasion
if
we
could
think
of
a
way
to
reduce
it
to
some
specific
area
of
paratime
one
of
ranthar
jard
deputies
began
that
precisely
what
we
been
trying
to
do
klav
vall
said
we
have
done
it
dalla
who
had
withdrawn
from
the
discussion
and
was
on
a
couch
at
the
side
of
the
room
surrounded
by
reports
and
abstracts
and
summaries
looked
up
i
took
hours
and
hours
of
on
kholghoor
sector
religions
before
i
went
out
on
that
chase
for
psychokinesis
and
precognition
data
she
said
about
six
or
eight
hundred
years
ago
there
were
religious
wars
and
heresies
and
religious
schisms
all
over
the
kharanda
country
no
matter
how
uniform
the
kholghoor
sector
may
be
otherwise
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
small
belts
and
of
different
religions
or
sects
or
that
right
ranthar
jard
agreed
brightening
we
have
hagiologists
who
know
all
that
stuff
we
have
a
couple
of
them
interrogate
those
slaves
i
do
know
how
much
they
can
get
out
of
them
lot
of
peasants
wo
be
up
on
the
theological
niceties
but
a
synthesis
of
what
we
get
from
the
lot
of
them
that
an
idea
vall
agreed
about
the
first
idea
we
had
here
oh
how
about
politics
too
check
on
who
the
king
what
the
stories
about
the
royal
family
are
that
sort
of
thing
ranthar
jard
looked
at
the
map
on
the
wall
the
croutha
have
only
gotten
halfway
to
nharkan
here
say
we
transpose
detectives
in
at
night
on
some
of
these
time
lines
we
think
are
promising
and
check
up
at
the
offices
on
a
big
landowner
north
of
jhirda
named
ghromdour
that
might
get
us
something
well
i
do
want
you
to
think
we
trying
to
get
out
of
work
chief
assistant
one
of
the
deputies
said
but
is
there
any
real
necessity
for
our
trying
to
locate
the
wizard
trader
time
lines
if
you
can
get
them
from
the
esaron
sector
it
be
the
same
wo
it
marv
in
this
business
you
never
depend
on
just
one
lead
ranthar
jard
told
him
and
beside
when
skordran
kirv

hits
the
base
of

in

there
no
guarantee
that
they
may
not
have
time
to

off
a

warning
to
the

at
the
base
here
in
india
we
have
to
hit
both
places
at
once
well
that
too
vall
said
but
the
main
thing
is
to
get
these
wizard
trader
camps
on
the
kholghoor
sector
cleaned
out
how
are
you
fixed
for
men
and
equipment
for
a

swaying
to
the

they
wore
the
hooded
cloaks
of

in
sober
contrast
to
the

we

and

ganadara
nodded
it
was
the
guidance
of
our
gods
and
yours
that
we
met
such
slaves
as
you
sold
at
the
outlanders
plantation
would
bring
a
fine
price
in
the
north
the
men
are
strong
and
have
the
look
of
good
the
women
are
comely
and
though
i

that
my

would
little
relish
it
did
i
bring

such
handmaidens

for
your

i
will
give
you
one
of
our
riding
whips
he
leaned
to
the
side
slashing
at
a
cactus
with
his
quirt
we
in
careba
have
no
trouble
with
our
wives
about
handmaidens
or
anything
else
by
safar
if
you
doubt
your
welcome
at
careba
wait
till
you
show
your
wares
another
calera
said
rifles
and
revolvers
like
those
come
to
our

and
then
old
and
battered

or
stolen
many
times
before
we
see
them
rifles
that
fire
seven
times
without

from

he
invoked
the

of
the
great

safar
again
the
trail
widened
and
leveled
they
all
came
up
abreast
with
the
strung
out
behind
and
sat
looking
across
the
valley
to
the
adobe
walls
of
the
town
that
perched
on
the
opposite
ridge
after
a
while
riders
began
dismounting
and
checking
and
tightening
a
couple
of
caleras
helped
ganadara
and
atarazola
inspect
their
when
they
remounted
atarazola
bowed
his
head
lifting
his
left
sleeve
to
cover
his
mouth
and
muttered
into
it
at
some
length
the
caleras
looked
at
him
curiously
and
inquired
of
ganadara
what
he
did
he
prays
ganadara
said
he
thanks
our
gods
that
we
have
lived
to
see
your
town
and
asks
that
we
be
spared
to
bring
many
more
trains
of
rifles
and
ammunition
up
this
trail
the
slaver
nodded
understandingly
the
caleras
were
a
pious
people
too
who
believed
in
keeping
on
friendly
terms
with
the
gods
may
safar
hand
work
with
the
hands
of
your
gods
for
it
he
said
making
what
to
a
would
have
been
an
extremely
ribald
sign
the
gods
watch
over
us
atarazola
said
lifting
his
head
they
are
near
us
even
now
they
have
spoken
words
of
comfort
in
my
ear
ganadara
nodded
the
gods
to
whom
his
partner
prayed
were
a
couple
of
paratime
policemen
crouching
over
a
radio
a
mile
or
so
down
the
ridge
my
brother
he
told
is
much
favored
by
our
gods
many
people
come
to
him
to
pray
for
them
yes
so
you
told
me
now
that
i
think
on
it
that
detail
had
been
included
in
the
he
had
been
given
under
hypnosis
i
serve
safar
as
do
all
caleras
but
i
have
heard
that
the
gods
are
good
gods
dealing
honestly
with
their
servants
an
hour
later
under
the
walls
of
the
town
drew
one
of
his
pistols
and
fired
all
four
barrels
in
rapid
succession
into
the
air
shouting
open
open
for
and
for
the
jeseru
traders
ganadara
and
atarazola
who
are
with
him
a
head
and
appeared
between
the
brick
merlons
of
the
wall
above
the
gate
shouted
down
a
welcome
and
then
turned
away
to
bawl
orders
the
gate
slid
aside
and
after
the
caravan
had
passed
through
naked
slaves
pushed
the
massive
thing
shut
again
although
they
were
familiar
with
the
interior
of
the
town
from
photographs
taken
with
transposition
spheres
like
they
looked
around
curiously
the
central
square
was
thronged
caleras
in
striped
robes
people
from
the
south
and
east
in
baggy
trousers
and
embroidered
shirts
mountaineers
in
deerskins
a
slave
market
was
in
progress
and
some
items
of
human
merchandise
were
assembled
in
little
groups
guarded
by
their
owners
and
inspected
by
prospective
buyers
they
seemed
to
be
all
natives
of
that
geographic
and
paratemporal
area
do
even
look
at
those
advised
they
are
but
culls
the
market
is
almost
over
we
go
to
the
house
of
where
all
the
considerable
men
gather
and
you
will
find
those
who
will
be
able
to
trade
slaves
worthy
of
the
goods
you
have
with
you
meanwhile
let
my
people
take
your
horses
and
packs
to
my
house
you
shall
be
my
guests
while
you
stay
in
careba
it
was
perfectly
safe
to
trust
he
was
a
murderer
and
a
brigand
and
a
slaver
but
he
would
never
incur
the
scorn
of
men
and
the
curse
of
the
gods
by
dealing
foully
with
a
guest
the
horses
and
packs
were
led
away
by
his
retainers
ganadara
and
atarazola
pushed
their
horses
after
his
and
through
the
crowd
the
house
of
like
every
other
building
in
careba
was
and
except
for
narrow
the
wide
stood
open
and
five
or
six
heavily
armed
caleras
lounged
just
inside
they
greeted
coru
and
faru
by
name
and
the
strangers
by
their
assumed
nationality
the
four
rode
through
into
what
appeared
to
be
the
stables
turning
their
horses
over
to
slaves
who
took
them
away
there
were
between
fifty
and
sixty
other
horses
in
the
place
illustration
divesting
themselves
of
their
weapons
in
an
anteroom
at
the
head
of
a
flight
of
steps
they
passed
under
an
arch
and
into
a
wide
shady
patio
where
thirty
or
forty
men
stood
about
or
squatted
on
piles
of
cushions
smoking
cheroots
drinking
from
silver
cups
talking
in
a
continuous
babel
most
of
them
were
in
calera
dress
though
there
were
men
of
other
communities
and
nations
in
other
garb
as
they
moved
across
the
patio
gathon
dard
caught
snatches
of
conversations
about
deals
in
slaves
and
horse
trades
about
bandit
raids
and
blood
feuds
about
women
and
horses
and
weapons
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
and
an
unusually
clean
robe
came
over
to
intercept
them
ha
lord
of
my
daughter
you
back
at
last
we
had
begun
to
fear
for
you
he
said
nothing
to
fear
father
of
my
wife
replied
we
sold
the
slaves
for
a
good
price
and
tarried
the
night
feasting
in
good
company
such
good
company
that
we
brought
some
of
it
with
us
atarazola
and
ganadara
men
of
the
jeseru
whose
daughter
mothered
my
sons
he
took
his
by
the
sleeve
and
pulled
him
aside
motioning
gathon
dard
and
antrath
alv
to
follow
they
brought
weapons
they
want
outland
slaves
of
the
sort
i
took
to
sell
in
the
big
valley
country
he
whispered
the
weapons
are
repeating
rifles
from
across
the
ocean
and
revolvers
they
also
have
much
ammunition
oh
safar
bless
you

that

have
dealt
fairly
with

and
return
often
again
come
lord
of
my
daughter
let
us
make
them
known
to
but
not
a
word
about
the
kind
of
weapons
you
have
strangers
until
we
can
speak
privately
say
only
that
you
have
rifles
to
trade
gathon
dard
nodded
evidently
there
was
some
sort
of
going
on
in
careba
and
his
wife
father
were
of
the
party
of
and
wanted
the
repeaters
and
for
themselves
swarthy
with
a
graying
beard
lounged
in
a
low
chair
across
the
patio
near
him
four
or
five
other
caleras
sat
or
squatted
or
reclined
all
smoking
the
rank
black
tobacco
of
the
country
and
drinking
wine
or
brandy
their
conversation
ceased
as
and
the
others
approached
the
chief
of
careba
listened
to
the
introduction
then
heaved
himself
to
his
feet
and
clapped
the
newcomers
on
the
shoulders
good
good
he
said
we
know
you
jeseru
people
you
honest
traders
you
come
this
far
into
our
mountains
too
seldom
we
can
trade
with
you
we
need
weapons
as
for
the
sort
of
slaves
you
want
we
have
none
too
many
now
but
in
eight
days
we
will
have
plenty
if
you
stay
with
us
that
long
careba
is
a
pleasant
place
to
be
ganadara
said
we
can
wait
what
sort
of
weapons
have
you
the
chief
asked
pistols
and
rifles
lord
of
my
father
sister
answered
for
them
the
packs

been
taken
to
my
house
where
our
friends
will
stay
we
can
bring
a
few
to
show
you
the
hour
after
evening
prayers
shot
a
keen
glance
at
his
son
and
nodded
or
better
i
will
come
to
your
house
then
thus
i
can
see
the
whole
load
how
will
that
be
better
i
will
be
there
too
said
then
turned
to
gathon
dard
and
antrath
alv
you
have
been
long
on
the
road
come
let
us
drink
cool
wine
and
then
we
will
eat
he
said
until
this
evening
he
led
his
and
the
traders
to
one
side
where
several
kegs
stood
on
trestles
with
cups
and
flagons
beside
them
they
filled
a
flagon
took
a
cup
apiece
and
went
over
to
a
pile
of
cushions
at
one
side
as
they
did
three
men
came
pushing
through
the
crowd
toward
seat
they
wore
a
costume
unfamiliar
to
gathon
dard
little
round
caps
with
red
and
green
streamers
behind
and
long
white
gowns
and
one
of
them
had
gold
rings
in
his
ears
one
of
them
said
bowing
we
are
three
men
of
the
usasu
cities
we
have
gold
to
spend
we
seek
a
beautiful
girl
to
be
first
concubine
to
our
king
son
who
is
now
come
to
the
estate
of
manhood
picked
up
the
pipe
he
had
laid
aside
and
it
frowning
men
of
the
usasu
you
have
a
heavy
responsibility
he
said
you
have
the
responsibility
for
the
future
of
your
kingdom
for
a
character
is
more
shaped
by
his
first
concubine
than
by
his
teachers
how
old
is
the
boy
sixteen
the
age
of
manhood
among
us
then
you
want
a
girl
older
but
not
much
older
she
should
be
versed
in
the
arts
of
love
but
innocent
of
heart
she
should
be
wise
but
teachable
gentle
and
loving
but
with
a
will
of
her
own
the
three
men
in
white
gowns
were
fidgeting
then
suddenly
like
three
marionettes
on
a
single
string
they
put
their
right
hands
to
their
mouths
and
then
plunged
them
into
the
left
sleeves
of
their
gowns
whipping
out
knives
and
then
sprang
as
one
upon
slashing
and
stabbing
gathon
dard
was
on
his
feet
at
once
he
hurled
the
wine
flagon
at
the
three
murderers
and
leaped
across
the
room
antrath
alv
went
bounding
after
him
and
by
this
time
three
or
four
of
the
group
around
chair
had
recovered
their
wits
and
jumped
to
their
feet
one
of
the
three
assailants
turned
and
slashed
with
his
knife
almost
disemboweling
a
calera
who
had
tried
to
grapple
with
him
before
he
could
free
the
blade
another
calera
brought
a
brandy
bottle
down
on
his
head
gathon
dard
sprang
upon
the
back
of
a
second
assassin
hooking
his
left
elbow
under
the
fellow
chin
and
grabbing
the
wrist
of
his
with
his
right
the
man
struggled
for
an
instant
then
went
limp
and
fell
forward
the
third
of
the
trio
of
murderers
was
still
slashing
at
the
fallen
chieftain
when
antrath
alv
chopped
him
along
the
side
of
the
neck
with
the
edge
of
his
hand
he
simply
dropped
and
lay
still
was
dead
he
had
been
slashed
and
cut
and
stabbed
in
twenty
places
his
throat
had
been
cut
at
least
three
times
and
he
had
almost
been
decapitated
the
wounded
calera
was
dead
yet
however
even
if
he
had
been
at
the
moment
on
the
operating
table
of
a
first
level
home
time
line
hospital
it
was
doubtful
if
he
could
have
been
saved
and
under
the
circumstances
his
could
be
measured
in
seconds
some
cushions
were
placed
under
his
head
and
women
called
to
attend
him
but
he
died
before
they
arrived
the
three
assassins
were
also
dead
except
for
a
few
cuts
on
the
scalp
of
the
one
who
had
been
felled
with
the
bottle
there
was
not
a
mark
on
any
of
them
kicked
one
of
them
in
the
face
and
cursed
we
killed
the
skunks
too
quickly
he
cried
we
should
have
overcome
them
alive
and
then
taken
our
time
about
dealing
with
them
as
they
deserved
he
went
on
to
specify
the
nature
of
their
deserts
such
infamy
well
i
swear
i
did
think
a
little
tap
like
i
gave
that
one
would
kill
him
the
excused
himself
of
course
i
was
thinking
only
of
safar
receive
him
antrath
alv
bent
over
the
one
he
had
i
did
kill
this
one
he
said
the
way
i
hit
him
if
i
had
his
neck
would
be
broken
and
it
not
see
he
twisted
at
the
dead
neck
i
think
they
took
poison
before
they
drew
their
knives
i
saw
all
of
them
put
their
hands
to
their
mouths
a
calera
exclaimed
and
look
see
how
their
jaws
are
clenched
he
picked
up
one
of
the
knives
and
used
it
to
pry
the
dead
man
jaws
apart
sniffing
at
his
lips
and
looking
into
his
mouth
look
his
teeth
and
his
tongue
are
discolored
there
is
a
strange
smell
too
antrath
alv
sniffed
then
turned
to
his
partner
halatane
he
whispered
gathon
dard
nodded
that
was
a
first
level
poison
paratimers
often
carried
halatane
capsules
on
the
more
barbaric
as
a
last
insurance
against
torture
but
holy
name
of
safar
what
manner
of
men
were
these
demanded
there
are
those
i
would
risk
my
life
to
kill
but
i
would
not
throw
it
away
thus
they
came
knowing
that
we
would
kill
them
and
took
the
poison
that
they
might
die
quickly
and
without
pain
a
calera
said
or
that
your
tortures
would
not
wring
from
them
the
names
and
nation
of
those
who
sent
them
an
elderly
man
in
the
dress
of
a
rancher
from
the
southeast
added
if
i
were
you
i
would
try
to
find
out
who
these
enemies
are
and
the
sooner
the
better
gathon
dard
was
examining
one
of
the
knives
a
folding
knife
with
a
broad
blade
locked
open
with
a
spring
the
handle
was
of
tortoise
shell
bolstered
with
brass
in
all
my
travels
he
said
i
never
saw
a
knife
of
this
workmanship
before
tell
me
do
you
know
from
what
country
these
outland
slaves
of
come
you
think
that
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
the
calera
asked
it
could
i
think
that
these
people
might
not
have
been
born
slaves
but
people
taken
captive
suppose
at
some
time
there
had
been
sold
to
and
sold
elsewhere
by
him
one
who
was
a
person
of
consequence
the
son
of
a
king
or
the
priest
of
some
god
gathon
dard
suggested
by
safar
yes
and
now
that
nation
wherever
it
is
is
at
with
us
said
this
must
be
thought
about
it
is
an
ill
thing
to
have
unknown
enemies
look
a
calera
who
had
begun
to
strip
the
three
dead
men
cried
these
are
not
of
the
usasu
cities
or
any
other
people
of
this
land
see
they
are
uncircumcised
many
of
the
slaves
whom
brought
to
careba
from
the
hills
have
been
uncircumcised
said
jeseru
i
think
you
have
your
sights
on
the
heart
of
it
he
frowned
now
think
you
will
those
who
had
this
done
be
satisfied
or
will
they
carry
on
their
hatred
against
all
of
us
a
hard
question
antrath
alv
said
you
caleras
do
not
serve
our
gods
but
you
are
our
friends
suffer
me
to
go
apart
and
pray
i
would
take
counsel
with
the
gods
that
they
may
aid
us
all
in
this
illustration
illustration
part
it
was
full
daylight
but
the
sun
was
hidden
a
thin
rain
fell
on
the
landing
around
at
police
terminal
dhergabar
equivalent
when
vall
and
dalla
left
the
rocket
across
the
black
lavalike
pavement
they
could
see
the
bulky
form
of
tortha
karf
hunched
under
a
long
cloak
with
his
flat
cap
pulled
down
over
his
brow
he
shook
hands
with
vall
and
kissed
cheeks
with
dalla
when
they
joined
him
car
over
here
he
said
nodding
toward
the
waiting
vehicle
yesterday
was
one
of
our
better
days
was
it
no
it
was
vall
agreed
they
climbed
into
the
car
and
the
driver
lifted
straight
up
to
two
thousand
feet
and
turned
soaring
down
to
land
on
the
chief
headquarters
building
a
mile
away
not
completely
stopped
sir
ranthar
jard
is
working
on
a
few
ideas
that
may
lead
him
to
the
kholghoor
time
lines
where
the
wizard
traders
are
operating
if
we
ca
get
them
through
their
output
we
may
nail
them
at
the
intake
unless
they
gotten
the
wind
up
and
closed
down
all
their
operations
tortha
karf
said
i
doubt
if
they
done
that
chief
vall
replied
we
do
know
who
these
people
are
of
course
and
it
hard
to
judge
their
reactions
but
they
willing
to
take
chances
for
big
gains
i
believe
they
think
they
safe
now
that
they
closed
out
the
compromised
time
line
and
killed
the
only
witness
against
them
well
what
ranthar
jard
doing
trying
to
locate
the
and
probability
belt
from
what
the
slaves
can
tell
him
about
their
religious
beliefs
about
the
local
king
and
the
prince
of
jhirda
and
the
noble
families
of
the
neighborhood
vall
said
when
he
has
it
localized
as
closely
as
he
can
he
going
to
start
pelting
the
whole
paratemporal
area
with
photographic
balls
dropped
from
aircars
on
police
terminal
over
the
spatial
equivalents
of
a
couple
of
cities
as
soon
as
he
gets
a
photo
that
shows
croutha
with
firearms
have
a
wizard
trader
time
line
sounds
simple
the
chief
said
the
car
landed
and
he
helped
dalla
out
i
suppose
both
you
and
he
know
how
many
chances
against
one
he
has
of
finding
anything
they
went
over
to
an
and
floated
down
to
the
floor
on
which
tortha
karf
had
a
duplicate
of
the
office
in
the
paratime
building
on
home
time
line
it
the
only
chance
we
have
though
there
one
thing
that
bothers
me
dalla
said
as
they
entered
the
office
and
went
back
behind
the
desk
i
understand
that
the
news
about
this
did
break
on
home
time
line
till
the
late
morning
of
day
was
murdered
at
about
local
time
which
would
be
this
morning
dhergabar
time
that
would
give
this
gang
fourteen
hours
to
hear
the
news
transmit
it
to
their
base
and
get
these
three
men
disguised
transposed
to
this
esaron
sector
time
line
and
into
careba
she
shook
her
head
that
pretty
fast
work
tortha
karf
looked
sidewise
at
verkan
vall
your
girl
has
the
makings
of
a
cop
vall
he
commented
she
been
a
big
help
on
esaron
and
kholghoor
sectors
vall
said
she
wants
to
stay
with
it
and
help
me
i
be
very
glad
to
have
her
with
me
tortha
karf
nodded
he
knew
too
that
dalla
would
want
to
have
to
go
back
to
home
time
line
and
wait
the
long
investigation
out
of
course
we
can
use
all
the
help
we
can
get
i
think
we
can
get
a
lot
from
dalla
fix
her
up
with
some
kind
of
a
title
and
police
status
assistant
or
something
like
that
he
clasped
hands
with
her
glad
to
have
you
on
the
cops
with
us
dalla
he
said
then
he
turned
to
vall
there
was
almost
hours
between
the
time
i
heard
about
this
and
when
this
blasted
yandar
yadd
got
hold
of
the
story
of
all
the
infernal
irresponsible
he
almost
choked
with
indignation
and
it
was
another
fourteen
hours
between
the
time
skordran
sent
in
his
report
and
i
heard
about
it
golzan
doth
sent
in
a
report
to
his
company
about
the
same
time
skordran
kirv
made
his
first
report
to
his
subchief
vall
mentioned
that
might
be
it
tortha
karf
considered
i
wish
there
were
another
explanation
because
that
implies
a
very
extensive
intelligence
network
which
means
a
big
organization
but
i
afraid
that
it
i
wish
i
could
pull
in
everybody
in
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
who
handled
that
report
and
them
of
course
we
ca
do
things
like
that
on
home
time
line
and
with
the
political
situation
what
it
is
now
why
what
been
happening
chief
tortha
karf
swore
with
weary
bitterness
salgath
trod
what
been
happening
at
first
after
yandar
yadd
broke
the
story
on
the
air
there
was
just
a
lot
of
unorganized
opposition
sniping
in
council
salgath
waited
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
the
management
members
were
beginning
to
rally
and
took
the
floor
the
centrists
and
right
moderates
were
trying
the
approach
that
did
as
much
good
as
trying
to
put
out
a
fifth
level
forest
fire
with
a
finally
salgath
got
a
motion
of
censure
against
the
management
recognized
that
means
a
confidence
vote
in
ten
days
salgath
has
a
rabble
of
leftists
and
dissident
centrists
with
him
i
doubt
if
he
can
muster
enough
votes
to
overturn
the
management
but
it
going
to
make
things
rough
for
us
which
may
be
just
the
reason
salgath
started
this
uproar
vall
suggested
that
tortha
karf
said
is
being
considered
there
is
a
discreet
inquiry
being
made
into
salgath
trod
associates
his
sources
of
income
and
so
on
nothing
has
turned
up
as
yet
but
we
have
hopes
i
believe
vall
said
that
we
have
a
better
chance
right
on
home
time
line
than
outtime
tortha
karf
looked
up
sharply
so
he
asked
vall
was
stuffing
tobacco
into
a
pipe
yes
chief
we
have
a
big
criminal
organization
let
call
it
the
slave
trust
for
a
the
people
who
run
it
are
stupid
the
fact
that
they
been
shipping
slaves
to
the
esaron
sector
for
ten
years
before
we
found
out
about
it
proves
that
so
does
the
speed
with
which
they
got
rid
of
this
right
in
front
of
a
pair
of
our
detectives
for
that
matter
so
does
the
speed
with
which
they
moved
in
to
exploit
this
croutha
invasion
of
kholghoor
sector
india
well
i
studied
illegal
and
subversive
organizations
all
over
paratime
and
among
the
really
successful
ones
there
are
a
few
uniform
principles
one
is
cellular
organization
small
groups
acting
in
isolation
from
one
another
coöperating
with
other
cells
but
ignorant
of
their
composition
another
is
the
principle
of
no
upward
contact
leaders
contacting
their
subordinates
through
and
ignorant
intermediaries
and
another
is
a
willingness
to
kill
off
anybody
who
looks
like
a
potential
betrayer
or
forced
witness
the
late
for
instance
i
be
willing
to
bet
that
if
we
pick
up
some
of
these
wizard
traders
say
or
a
gang
that
selling
slaves
to
some
personality
on
some
other
time
line
and
them
all
they
be
able
to
do
will
be
name
a
few
immediate
associates
and
the
group
leader
will
know
that
he
contacted
from
time
to
time
by
some
stranger
with
orders
and
that
he
can
make
emergency
contacts
only
through
some
blind
the
men
who
are
running
this
are
right
on
home
time
line
many
of
them
in
positions
of
prominence
and
if
we
can
catch
one
of
them
and
him
we
can
start
a
of
disclosures
all
through
this
slave
trust
how
are
we
going
to
get
at
these
top
men
tortha
karf
wanted
to
know
advertise
for
them
on
telecast
they
leave
traces
they
wo
be
able
to
avoid
it
i
think
right
now
that
salgath
trod
is
one
of
them
i
think
there
are
other
prominent
politicians
and
business
people
look
for
irregularities
and
peculiarities
in
outtime
transactions
for
instance
to
sections
in
esaron
sector
or
big
gold
bullion
transactions
yes
and
if
they
have
any
really
elaborate
outtime
bases
need
equipment
that
can
only
be
gotten
on
home
time
line
tortha
karf
added
paratemporal
conveyer
parts
and
mesh
you
ca
just
walk
into
a
hardware
store
and
buy
that
sort
of
thing
dalla
leaned
forward
to
drop
her
cigarette
ash
into
a
tray
try
looking
into
the
bureau
of
psychological
hygiene
she
suggested
that
where
you
really
strike
it
rich
vall
and
tortha
karf
both
turned
abruptly
and
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
go
on
tortha
karf
encouraged
this
sounds
interesting
the
people
back
of
this
dalla
said
are
definitely
classifiable
as
criminals
they
may
never
perform
a
criminal
act
themselves
but
they
give
orders
for
and
profit
from
such
acts
and
they
must
possess
the
motivation
and
psychology
of
criminals
we
define
people
as
criminals
when
they
suffer
from
psychological
aberrations
of
an
antisocial
character
usually
paranoid
excessive
egoism
disregard
for
the
rights
of
others
inability
to
recognize
the
social
necessity
for
mutual
coöperation
and
confidence
on
home
time
line
we
have
universal
psychological
testing
for
the
purpose
of
detecting
and
eliminating
such
characteristics
it
seems
to
have
failed
in
this
case
tortha
karf
began
then
snapped
his
fingers
of
course
how
blasted
silly
can
i
get
when
not
trying
yes
of
course
verkan
vall
agreed
find
out
how
these
people
missed
being
spotted
by
psychotesting
that
lead
us
to
missed
being
tested
adequately
and
also
who
got
into
the
bureau
of
psychological
hygiene
who
did
belong
there
i
think
you
ought
to
give
an
investigation
of
the
whole
bupsychhyg
setup
very
high
priority
dalla
said
a
psychotest
is
only
as
good
as
the
people
who
give
it
and
if
we
have
criminals
administering
these
tests
we
have
our
friends
on
executive
council
tortha
karf
said
see
that
that
point
is
raised
when
council
he
looked
at
the
clock
that
be
in
three
hours
by
the
way
if
it
accomplish
another
thing
it
put
salgath
trod
in
the
middle
he
ca
demand
an
investigation
of
the
paratime
police
out
of
one
side
of
his
mouth
and
oppose
an
investigation
of
psychological
hygiene
out
of
the
other
now
what
else
have
we
to
talk
about
illustration
those
hundred
slaves
we
got
off
the
esaron
sector
vall
said
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
them
and
if
we
locate
the
time
line
the
slavers
have
their
bases
on
we
have
hundreds
probably
thousands
more
we
ca
sort
them
out
and
send
them
back
to
their
own
time
lines
even
if
that
would
be
desirable
tortha
karf
decided
why
settle
them
somewhere
on
the
service
sector
i
know
the
paratime
transposition
code
limits
the
service
sector
to
natives
of

the
paratime

been
so
badly
battered
by
this

there
wo
make

find
if

you
take

of
it
set
up
your

coming
up
in

on

i
not
asking

if
we
do
get
this

cleared
up

we
in

i
realize
that
sir
dalla
you
better
go
back
to
home
time
line
with
the
chief
he
said
there
nothing
you
can
do
to
help
me
here
at

get
some
rest
and
then
try
to
wangle
an
invitation
for
the
two
of

to
dinner
at

this
evening
he
turned
back
to
tortha

even
if
he
never
pays
any
attention
to

dras
still
owns
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
he
said
he
might
be
able
to
find
out
or
help
us
find
out
how
the
story
about
those
slaves
leaked
out
of
his
company
well
that
wo
take
much
doing
dalla
said
if
there
as
much
excitement
on

as
i
think
dras
would
turn
somersaults
and
jump
through
hoops
to
get
us
to
one
of
his
dinners
right
now
salgath

pushed
the
litter
of
papers
and
spools
to
one
side
impatiently
well
what
else
did
you
expect
he
demanded
this
was
the
logical
next
move
bupsychhyg
is
supposed
to
detect
anybody
who
believes
in
looking
out
for
his
own
interests
first
and
condition
him
into
a
pious
sucker
well
the
sacred
bureau
of
slipped
up
on
a
lot
of
us
it
a
natural
alibi
for
tortha
karf
it
also
a
lot
of
grief
for
all
of
us
the
young
man
in
the
tunic
added
i
do
want
my
psychotests
reviewed
by
some
bigot
who
ca
be
reasoned
with
and
neither
do
you
i
getting
something
organized
to
counter
that
salgath
trod
said
i
going
to
attack
the
whole
scientific
basis
of
psychotesting
there
frasthor
klav
he
always
contended
that
what
are
called
criminal
tendencies
are
the
result
of
the
individual
total
environment
and
that
psychotesting
and
are
valueless
because
the
total
environment
changes
from
day
to
day
even
from
hour
to
hour
that
wo
do
the
nameless
young
man
who
was
the
messenger
of
somebody
equally
nameless
retorted
frasthor
a
crackpot
no
reputable
psychologist
or
psychist
gives
his
opinions
a
consideration
and
besides
we
do
want
to
attack
psychological
hygiene
the
people
in
it
with
whom
we
can
do
business
are
our
safeguard
they
given
all
of
us
a
clean
bill
of
mental
health
and
we
have
papers
to
prove
it
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
make
it
appear
that
that
incident
on
the
esaron
sector
is
all
there
is
to
this
and
also
involve
the
paratime
police
themselves
the
slavers
are
all
paracops
it
is
the
fault
of
bupsychhyg
because
the
paratime
police
have
their
own
psychotesting
staff
that
where
the
trouble
is
the
paracops
have
been
adequately
testing
their
own
personnel
now
how
are
you
going
to
do
that
salgath
trod
asked
disdainfully
you
take
the
floor
the
first
thing
tomorrow
and
utilize
these
new
revelations
about
the
wizard
traders
you
accuse
the
paratime
police
of
being
the
wizard
traders
themselves
why
not
they
have
their
own
paratemporal
transposition
equipment
shops
on
police
terminal
they
have
facilities
for
manufacturing
duplicates
of
any
kind
of
outtime
items
like
the
firearms
for
instance
and
they
know
which
time
lines
on
which
sectors
are
being
exploited
by
legitimate
paratime
traders
and
which
are
what
to
prevent
a
gang
of
unscrupulous
paracops
from
moving
in
on
a
few
unexploited
kholghoor
time
lines
buying
captives
from
the
croutha
and
shipping
them
to
the
esaron
sector
then
why
would
they
let
a
thing
like
this
get
out
salgath
trod
inquired
somebody
slipped
up
and
moved
a
lot
of
slaves
onto
an
exploited
esaron
time
line
or
rather
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
established
a
plantation
on
a
time
line
they
were
shipping
slaves
to
parenthetically
that
what
really
did
happen
the
mistake
our
people
made
was
in
not
closing
out
that
time
line
as
soon
as
consolidated
foodstuffs
moved
in
the
young
man
said
so
this
skordran
kirv
who
is
a
dumb
boy
who
does
know
what
the
score
is
found
these
slaves
and
blatted
about
it
to
this
golzan
doth
and
golzan
reported
it
to
his
company
and
it
could
be
hushed
up
so
now
tortha
karf
is
trying
to
scare
the
public
with
ghost
stories
about
a
gigantic
paratemporal
conspiracy
to
get
more
appropriations
and
more
power
how
long
do
you
think
i
get
away
with
that
salgath
trod
demanded
i
can
only
stretch
parliamentary
immunity
so
far
sooner
or
later
i
have
to
make
formal
charges
to
a
special
judicial
committee
and
that
would
mean
and
then
it
would
all
come
out
you
have
proof
the
young
man
said
we
produce
a
couple
of
these
kharandas
whom
verkan
vall
did
get
hold
of
under
they
testify
that
they
saw
a
couple
of
wizard
traders
take
their
robes
off
under
the
robes
were
paratime
police
uniforms
do
you
follow
me
salgath
trod
made
a
noise
of
angry
disgust
that
ridiculous
i
suppose
these
kharandas
will
be
given
what
is
deludedly
known
as
memory
obliteration
and
a
set
of
how
long
do
you
think
that
would
last
about
three
there
is
no
such
thing
as
memory
obliteration
there
and
overlay
you
ca
get
behind
that
with
any
quickie
in
the
back
room
of
any
police
post
i
admit
that
he
said
but
a
skilled
psychist
can
discover
inside
of
five
minutes
when
a
subject
is
carrying
a
load
of
false
memories
and
in
time
and
not
too
much
time
all
that
top
layer
of
false
memories
and
blockages
can
be
peeled
off
and
then
where
would
we
be
now
wait
a
minute
councilman
this
is
just
something
i
dreamed
up
the
visitor
said
this
was
decided
upon
at
the
top
at
the
very
top
i
do
care
whose
idea
it
was
salgath
trod
snapped
the
whole
thing
is
idiotic
and
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
the
visitor
face
froze
all
the
respect
vanished
from
his
manner
and
tone
his
voice
was
like
ice
cakes
grating
together
in
a
winter
river
look
salgath
this
is
an
organization
order
he
said
you
refuse
to
obey
organization
orders
and
you
do
quit
the
organization
now
get
smart
big
boy
do
what
you
told
to
he
took
a
spool
of
record
tape
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
desk
outline
for
your
speech
put
it
in
your
own
words
but
follow
it
exactly
he
stood
watching
salgath
trod
for
a
moment
i
wo
bother
telling
you
what
happen
to
you
if
you
do
he
added
you
can
figure
that
out
for
yourself
with
that
he
turned
and
went
out
the
private
door
for
a
while
salgath
trod
sat
staring
after
him
once
he
put
his
hand
out
toward
the
spool
then
jerked
it
back
as
though
the
thing
were
radioactive
once
he
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
just
the
green
aircar
settled
onto
the
landing
stage
verkan
vall
on
the
front
seat
beside
the

opened
the

tomorrow
morning
all
the
commentators
will
be
yakking
about
my
carousing
around
when
i
ought
to
be
battling
the
slave
trust
no
use
advertising
myself
with
an
official
car
and
giving
them
a
chance
to
add
public
expense
well
have
some
fun
while
you

the

reaching
for
the
phone
want

to
check

here
sir
yes
if

drenth
kandagro
his
human
servant
admitted
him
to
the
apartment
six
floors
down
mistress
dalla
is
dressing
he
said
she
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
you
are
invited
to
dinner
this
evening
with
thalvan
dras
at
his
apartment
vall
nodded
ill
talk
to
her
about
it
now
he
said
lay
out
my
dress
uniform
short
jacket
boots
and
breeches
and
needler
yes
master
i
go
lay
out
your
things
and
get
your
bath
ready
the
servant
turned
and
went
into
the
alcove
which
gave
access
to
the
dressing
rooms
turning
right
into
vall
vall
followed
him
turning
left
into
his
wife
oh
dalla
he
called
in
here
her
voice
came
out
of
her
bathroom
he
passed
through
the
dressing
room
to
find
her
stretched
on
a
couch
while
her
maid
rendarra
was
rubbing
her
body
vigorously
with
some
stuff
about
the
consistency
of
her
face
was
masked
in
the
stuff
and
her
hair
was
covered
with
an
elastic
cap
he
had
always
suspected
that
beauty
was
the
real
feminine
religion
from
the
willingness
of
its
devotees
to
submit
to
martyrdom
for
it
she
wiggled
a
hand
at
him
in
greeting
how
did
it
go
she
asked
i
organized
myself
a
sort
of
miniature
police
force
within
a
police
force
and
i
have
liaison
officers
in
every
organization
down
to
sector
regional
so
that
i
can
be
informed
promptly
in
case
anything
new
turns
up
anywhere
what
been
happening
on
home
time
line
i
picked
up
a
at
paratime
police
headquarters
it
seems
that
a
lot
more
stuff
has
leaked
out
kholghoor
sector
wizard
traders
and
all
how
it
happen
dalla
rolled
over
to
allow
rendarra
to
rub
the
grease
on
her
back
consolidated
outtime
foodstuffs
let
a
gang
of
reporters
in
today
i
think
they
afraid
somebody
will
accuse
them
of
complicity
and
they
want
to
get
their
side
of
it
before
the
public
all
our
crowd
are
off
that
time
line
except
a
couple
of
detectives
at
the
plantation
i
know
he
smiled
dalla
was
thinking
of
the
paratime
police
as
our
crowd
now
how
about
this
dinner
at
dras
place
oh
that
was
easy
she
shifted
position
again
i
just
called
dras
up
and
told
him
that
our
vacation
was
off
and
he
invited
us
before
i
could
begin
hinting
what
are
you
going
to
wear
greens
i
can
carry
a
needler
with
that
uniform
even
wear
it
at
the
table
i
do
think
it
smart
for
me
to
run
around
unarmed
even
on
home
time
line
especially
on
home
time
line
he
amended
when
this
affair
going
to
start
and
how
long
will
rendarra
take
to
get
that
goo
off
you
salgath
trod
left
his
aircar
at
the
top
landing
stage
of
his
apartment
building
and
sent
it
away
to
the
hangars
under
robot
control
he
glanced
about
him
as
he
went
toward
the
antigrav
shaft
there
were
a
dozen
vehicles
in
the
air
above
any
of
them
might
have
followed
him
from
the
paratime
building
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
had
been
under
constant
surveillance
from
the
moment
the
nameless
messenger
had
delivered
the
organization
ultimatum
until
he
delivered
that
speech
the
next
morning
or
manifested
an
intention
of
refusing
to
do
so
however
he
would
be
safe
after
that
alone
in
his
office
he
had
reviewed
the
situation
point
by
point
and
then
gone
back
and
reviewed
it
again
the
conclusion
was
inescapable
the
organization
had
ordered
him
to
make
an
accusation
which
he
himself
knew
to
be
false
that
was
the
first
premise
the
conclusion
was
that
he
would
be
killed
as
soon
as
he
had
made
it
that
was
the
trouble
with
being
mixed
up
with
that
kind
of
people
you
were
expendable
and
sooner
or
later
they
would
decide
that
they
would
have
to
expend
you
and
what
could
you
do
to
begin
with
an
accusation
of
criminal
malfeasance
made
against
a
management
or
paratime
commission
agency
on
the
floor
of
executive
council
was
tantamount
to
an
accusation
made
in
court
automatically
the
accuser
became
a
criminal
prosecutor
and
would
have
to
repeat
his
accusation
under
then
the
whole
story
would
come
out
bit
by
bit
back
to
its
beginning
in
that
first
illegal
deal
in
opium
diverted
from
trade
with
the
khiftan
sector
and
sold
on
second
level
luvarian
empire
sector
and
the
deals
in
radioactive
poisons
and
the
slave
trade
he
would
be
able
to
name
few
names
the
organization
kept
its
activities
too
well
compartmented
for
that
but
he
could
talk
of
things
that
had
happened
and
when
and
where
and
on
what
paratemporal
areas
no
the
organization
would
let
that
happen
and
the
only
way
it
could
be
prevented
would
be
by
the
death
of
salgath
trod
as
soon
as
he
had
made
his
speech
all
the
talk
of
providing
him
with
corroborative
evidence
was
silly
it
had
been
intended
to
lead
him
more
trustingly
to
the
slaughter
they
kill
him
of
course
in
some
way
that
would
be
calculated
to
substantiate
the
story
he
would
no
longer
be
able
to
repudiate
the
killer
who
would
be
promptly
rayed
dead
by
somebody
else
would
wear
a
paratime
police
uniform
or
something
like
that
that
was
of
no
importance
however
by
then
be
beyond
caring
one
of
his
three
servsec
prole
servants
the
slim
brown
girl
who
was
his
housekeeper
and
hostess
and
also
his
mistress
admitted
him
to
the
apartment
he
kissed
her
perfunctorily
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
you
tired
she
said
let
me
call
nindrandigro
and
have
him
bring
you
chilled
wine
lie
down
and
rest
until
dinner
no
no
i
want
brandy
he
went
to
a
cellaret
and
got
out
a
decanter
and
goblet
pouring
himself
a
drink
how
soon
will
dinner
be
ready
the
brown
girl
squeezed
a
little
golden
globe
that
hung
on
a
chain
around
her
neck
a
tiny
voice
inside
it
repeated
eighteen
ten
eighteen
eleven
eighteen
twelve
in
half
an
hour
it
still
in
the
she
told
him
he
downed
half
the
set
it
down
and
went
to
a
painting
a
brutal
scarlet
and
abstraction
that
hung
on
the
wall
swinging
it
aside
and
revealing
the
safe
behind
it
he
used
his
took
out
a
wad
of
paratemporal
exchange
bank
notes
and
gave
them
to
the
girl
here
zinganna
take
these
and
take
nindrandigro
and
calilla
out
for
the
evening
go
where
you
can
all
have
a
good
time
and
do
come
back
till
after
midnight
there
will
be
some
business
transacted
here
and
i
want
them
out
of
this
get
them
out
of
here
as
soon
as
you
can
i
see
to
the
dinner
myself
spend
all
of
that
you
want
to
the
girl
riffled
through
the
wad
of
banknotes
why
you
trod
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
enthusiastically
i
go
tell
them
at
once
and
have
a
good
time
zinganna
have
the
best
time
you
possibly
can
he
told
her
embracing
and
kissing
her
now
get
out
of
here
i
have
to
keep
my
mind
on
business
when
she
had
gone
he
finished
his
drink
and
poured
another
he
drew
and
checked
his
needler
then
after
checking
the
and
activating
the
outside
viewscreens
he
lit
a
cheroot
and
sat
down
at
the
desk
his
goblet
and
his
needler
in
front
of
him
to
wait
until
the
servants
were
gone
there
was
only
one
way
out
alive
he
knew
that
and
yet
he
needed
brandy
and
a
great
deal
of
mental
effort
to
steel
himself
for
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
face
there
would
be
almost
a
year
of
unremitting
agony
physical
and
mental
worse
than
a
khiftan
torture
rack
there
would
be
the
shame
of
having
his
innermost
secrets
poured
out
of
him
by
the
psychotherapists
and
at
the
end
there
would
emerge
someone
who
would
not
be
salgath
trod
or
anybody
like
salgath
trod
and
he
would
have
to
learn
to
know
this
stranger
and
build
a
new
life
for
him
in
one
of
the
viewscreens
he
saw
the
door
to
the
service
hallway
open
zinganna
in
a
black
evening
gown
and
a
black
velvet
cloak
and
calilla
the
housemaid
in
what
she
believed
to
be
a
reasonable
facsimile
of
fashionable
first
level
dress

nindrandigro
in
one
of
his
master
evening
suits
emerged
salgath
trod
waited
until
they
had
gone
down
the
hall
to
the
antigrav
shaft
and
then
he
turned
on
the
visiphone
checked
the
security
set
it
for
sealed
beam
communication
and
punched
out
a
combination
a
girl
in
a
green
tunic
looked
out
of
the
screen
paratime

she
said
office
of
chief
tortha
i
am
executive
councilman
salgath
trod
he
told
her
i
am
and
for
the
past
fifteen
years
have
been
criminally
involved
with
the
organization
responsible
for
the
slave
trade
which
recently
came
to
light
on
third
level
esaron
i
give
myself
up
unconditionally
i
am
willing
to
make
full
confession
under
and
will
accept
whatever
disposition
of
my
case
is
lawfully
judged
fit
you
have
to
send
an
escort
for
me
i
might
start
from
my
apartment
alone
but
be
killed
before
i
got
to
your
headquarters
the
girl
who
had
begun
to
listen
in
the
bored
manner
of
public
servants
phone
girls
was
staring
just
a
moment
councilman
salgath
i
put
you
through
to
chief
tortha
the
dinner
lacked
a
half
hour
of
being
served
thalvan
dras
guests
loitered
about
the
drawing
room
sampling
appetizers
and
chilled
drinks
and
chatting
in
groups
it
was
the
artistic
crowd
usual
at
thalvan
dras
dinners
most
of
the
guests
seemed
to
be
business
or
political
people
thalvan
dras
had
gotten
vall
and
dalla
into
the
small
group
around
him
along
with
pudgy
brogoth
zaln
his
confidential
secretary
and
javrath
brend
his
financial
attorney
i
do
see
why
they
making
such
a
fuss
about
it
one
of
the
banking
cartel
people
was
saying
causing
a
lot
of
public
excitement
all
out
of
proportion
to
the
importance
of
the
affair
after
all
those
people
were
slaves
on
their
own
time
line
and
if
anything
they
much
better
off
on
the
esaron
sector
than
they
would
be
as
captives
of
the
croutha
as
far
as
that
goes
what
the
difference
between
that
and
the
way
we
drag
these
fourth
level
primitive
people
off
to
fifth
level
service
sector
to
work
for
us
oh
there
a
big
difference
farn
javrath
brend
said
we
recruit
those
fourth
level
primitives
out
of
probability
worlds
of
stone
age
savagery
and
transpose
them
to
our
own
fifth
level
time
lines
practically
outtime
extensions
of
the
home
time
line
absolutely
no
question
of
the
paratime
secret
being
compromised
illustration
beside
we
need
a
certain
amount
of
human
labor
for
tasks
requiring
original
thought
and
decision
that
are
beyond
the
ability
of
robots
and
most
of
it
is
work
our
citizens
simply
would
perform
thalvan
dras
added
well
from
a
moral
standpoint
would
these
esaron
sector
people
who
buy
the
slaves
justify
slavery
in
the
same
terms
a
woman
whom
vall
had
identified
as
a
left
moderate
council
member
asked
there
still
a
big
difference
dalla
told
her
the
servsec
proles
are
beaten
or
tortured
or
chained
we
do
break
up
families
or
separate
friends
when
we
recruit
fourth
level
primitives
we
take
whole
tribes
and
they
come
willingly
and
one
of
thalvan
dras
human
servants
of
the
class
under
discussion
approached
vall
a
visiphone
call
for
your
lordship
he
whispered
chief
tortha
karf
calling
if
your
lordship
will
come
this
way
in
a
outside
vall
found
tortha
karf
looking
out
of
the
screen
he
was
seated
at
his
desk
fiddling
with
a
gold
multicolor
pen
oh
vall
something
interesting
has
just
come
up
he
spoke
in
a
voice
of
forced
calmness
i
ca
go
into
it
now
but
you
want
to
hear
about
it
i
sending
a
car
for
you
better
bring
dalla
along
she
want
in
on
it
too
right
we
be
on
the
top
landing
stage
in
a
few
minutes
dalla
was
still
heatedly
repudiating
any
resemblance
between
the
normal
first
level
methods
of
and
the
activities
of
the
wizard
traders
she
had
just
finished
the
story
of
the
woman
whose
child
had
been
brained
when
vall
rejoined
the
group
dras
i
awfully
sorry
he
said
this
is
the
second
time
in
succession
that
dalla
and
i
have
had
to
bolt
away
from
here
but
policemen
are
like
doctors
always
on
call
and
consequently
unreliable
guests
while
you
feasting
think
commiseratingly
of
dalla
and
me
we
probably
be
having
a
sandwich
and
a
cup
of
coffee
somewhere
i
terribly
sorry
thalvan
dras
replied
we
had
all
been
looking
forward
well
brogoth
have
a
car
called
for
vall
and
dalla
police
car
coming
for
us
it
probably
on
the
landing
stage
now
vall
said
well
everybody
coming
dalla
they
had
a
few
minutes
to
wait
under
the
marquee
before
the
green
police
aircar
landed
and
came
rolling
across
the
surface
of
the
landing
stage
crossing
to
it
and
opening
the
rear
door
he
put
dalla
in
and
climbed
in
after
her
slamming
the
door
it
was
only
then
that
he
saw
tortha
karf
hunched
down
in
the
rear
seat
he
motioned
them
to
silence
and
did
not
speak
until
the
car
was
rising
above
the
building
i
wanted
to
fill
you
in
on
this
as
soon
as
possible
he
said
your
hunch
about
salgath
trod
was
good
just
a
few
minutes
before
i
called
you
he
called
me
he
says
this
slave
trade
is
the
work
of
something
he
calls
the
organization
says
he
been
taking
orders
from
them
for
years
his
attack
on
the
management
and
motion
for
a
were
dictated
from
organization
top
echelon
now
he
convinced
that
they
going
to
force
him
to
make
false
accusations
against
the
paratime
police
and
then
kill
him
before
he
compelled
to
repeat
his
charges
under
so
he
offered
to
surrender
and
trade
information
for
protection
how
much
does
he
know
vall
asked
tortha
karf
shook
his
head
not
as
much
as
he
claims
to
i
suppose
he
would
want
to
reduce
his
own
value
but
he
been
involved
in
this
thing
for
the
last
fifteen
years
and
with
his
political
prominence
he
know
quite
a
lot
we
can
protect
him
from
his
own
gang
can
we
protect
him
from
no
and
he
knows
it
he
willing
to
accept
that
he
seems
to
think
that
death
at
the
hands
of
his
own
associates
is
the
only
other
alternative
probably
right
too
the
floodlighted
green
towers
of
the
paratime
building
were
wheeling
under
them
as
they
circled
down
why
would
they
sacrifice
a
valuable
accomplice
like
salgath
trod
in
order
to
make
a
transparently
false
accusation
against
us
vall
wondered
ha
that
our
new
rookie
cop
idea
tortha
karf
chuckled
nodding
toward
dalla
we
got
zortan
harn
to
introduce
an
motion
to
appoint
a
committee
to
investigate
bupsychhyg
this
morning
the
motion
passed
and
this
is
the
reaction
to
it
the
scared
just
as
dalla
predicted
they
do
want
us
finding
out
how
people
with
potentially
criminal
characteristics
missed
being
spotted
by
psychotesting
salgath
trod
is
being
sacrificed
to
block
or
delay
that
vall
nodded
as
the
wheels
bumped
on
the
landing
stage
and
the
antigrav
field
went
off
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
happened
when
you
started
on
a
really
fruitful
line
of
investigation
they
got
out
and
hurried
over
under
the
marquee
the
car
lifting
and
moving
off
toward
the
hangars
this
was
the
real
break
no
matter
how
this
organization
might
be
compartmented
a
man
like
salgath
trod
would
know
a
great
deal
he
would
name
names
and
the
bearers
of
those
names
arrested
and
would
name
other
names
in
a
perfect
chain
reaction
of
confessions
and
betrayals
another
police
car
had
landed
just
ahead
of
them
and
three
men
were
climbing
out
two
were
in
paratime
police
green
and
the
third
was
in
service
sector
proletarian
garb
at
first
vall
though
that
salgath
trod
had
been
brought
in
disguised
as
a
prole
prisoner
and
then
he
saw
that
the
prisoner
was
short
and
stocky
not
at
all
like
the
slender
and
elegant
politician
the
two
officers
who
had
brought
him
in
were
talking
to
a
lieutenant
sothran
barth
outside
the
antigrav
shaft
kiosk
as
vall
and
tortha
karf
and
dalla
walked
over
the
car
which
had
brought
them
lifted
out
something
that
just
came
in
from
industrial
chief
lieutenant
sothran
said
in
answer
to
tortha
karf
question
may
be
for
assistant
verkan
desk
he
a
prole
named
yandragno
sir
one
of
the
policemen
said
industrial
sector
constabulary
grabbed
him
peddling
martian
hellweed
cigarettes
to
the
girls
in
a
textile
mill
at
kangabar
equivalent
captain
jamzar
thinks
he
may
have
gotten
them
from
somebody
in
the
organization
a
little
warning
bell
began
ringing
in
the
back
of
verkan
vall
mind
but
at
first
he
could
not
consciously
identify
the
cause
of
his
suspicions
he
looked
the
two
policemen
and
their
prisoner
over
carefully
but
could
see
nothing
visibly
wrong
with
them
then
another
car
came
in
for
a
landing
and
rolled
over
under
the
marquee
the
door
opened
and
a
police
officer
got
out
followed
by
an
elegantly
dressed
civilian
whom
he
recognized
at
once
as
salgath
trod
a
second
policeman
was
emerging
from
the
car
when
vall
suddenly
realized
what
it
was
that
had
disturbed
him
it
had
been
salgath
trod
himself
less
than
half
an
hour
ago
who
had
introduced
the
term
the
organization
to
the
paratime
police
at
that
time
if
these
people
were
what
they
claimed
to
be
they
would
have
been
in
transposition
from
industrial
on
the
fifth
level
immediately
he
reached
for
his
needler
he
was
clearing
it
of
the
holster
when
things
began
happening
the
handcuffs
fell
from
the
prisoner
wrists
he
jerked
a
blaster
from
under
his
jacket
vall
his
needler
already
drawn
rayed
the
fellow
dead
before
he
could
aim
it
then
saw
that
the
two
had
drawn
their
needlers
and
were
aiming
in
the
direction
of
salgath
trod
there
were
no
flashes
or
reports
only
the
spot
of
light
that
had
winked
on
and
off
under
vall
rear
sight
had
told
him
that
his
weapon
had
been
activated
he
saw
it
appear
again
as
the
sights
centered
on
one
of
the
policemen
then
he
saw
the
other
imposter
needler
aimed
at
himself
that
was
the
last
thing
he
expected
ever
to
see
in
that
life
he
tried
to
shift
his
own
weapon
and
time
seemed
frozen
with
his
arm
barely
moving
then
there
was
a
white
blur
as
dalla
cloak
moved
in
front
of
him
and
the
needler
dropped
from
the
fingers
of
the
disguised
murderer
time
went
back
to
normal
for
him
he
safetied
his
own
weapon
and
dropped
it
jumping
forward
he
grabbed
the
fellow
in
the
green
uniform
by
the
nose
with
his
left
hand
and
punched
him
hard
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
with
his
right
fist
the
man
mouth
flew
open
and
a
green
capsule
the
size
and
shape
of
a
small
bean
flew
out
pushing
dalla
aside
before
she
would
step
on
it
he
kicked
the
murderer
in
the
stomach
doubling
him
over
and
chopped
him
on
the
base
of
the
skull
with
the
edge
of
his
hand
the
dropped
senseless
with
a
handful
of
from
his
pocket
he
picked
up
the
disgorged
capsule
wrapping
it
carefully
after
making
sure
that
it
was
unbroken
then
he
looked
around
the
other
two
assassins
were
dead
tortha
karf
who
had
been
looking
at
the
man
in
proletarian
dress
whom
vall
had
killed
first
turned
looked
in
another
direction
and
then
cursed
vall
followed
his
eyes
and
cursed
also
one
of
the
two
policemen
who
had
gotten
out
of
the
aircar
was
dead
too
and
so
was
the
witness
salgath
trod
as
dead
as
a
hundred
thousand
parayears
away
the
whole
thing
had
ended
within
thirty
seconds
for
about
half
as
long
everybody
waited
poised
in
a
sort
of
for
something
else
to
happen
dalla
had
dropped
the
with
which
she
had
clubbed
the
prisoner
needler
out
of
his
hand
and
caught
up
the
fallen
weapon
when
she
saw
that
the
man
was
down
and
motionless
she
laid
it
aside
and
began
picking
up
the
glittering
or
silken
trifles
that
had
spilled
from
the
burst
bag
vall
retrieved
his
own
weapon
glanced
over
it
and
holstered
it
sothran
barth
the
lieutenant
in
charge
of
the
landing
stage
was
bawling
orders
and
men
were
coming
out
of

and
piling
into
vehicles
to
pursue
the
aircar

had
brought
the
assassins

important
he
glanced
around
the
fact
is
he
all
we
have
to
show
for
this
business
then
he
stooped
to
help
dalla
gather
her
things
picking
up
a
few
of
them
a
lighter
a
tiny
crystal
perfume
flask
miraculously
unbroken
a
box
which
had
sprung
open
and
spilled
half
its
contents
he
handed
them
to
her
while
sothran
barth
bent
over
the
prisoner
and
gave
him
an
injection
then
went
to
the
body
of
the
other
forcing
open
his
mouth
in
his
cheek

unbroken

general
procedure

have
a
look
at
the
other
one

man

proletarian
dress

have
had
his
capsule
between
his
molars

he
had
been
killed

was
broken
and
there

a
brownish
discoloration
and
chemical
odor
in
his
mouth

of
the
paratime
code
enforcement
division
and
verkan
vall

dalla
and
tortha

and
four
or
five
others
looked
across
the
desk
and
to
the
end
of
the
room
as
the
telecast
screen
broke
into
a
shifting
and
then
cleared
the
face
of
the
announcer
appeared
a
young
woman
and
now
we
bring
you
the
statement
which
chief
tortha
of
the
paratime
police
has
promised
for
this
time
this
portion
of
the
program
was
recorded
at
paratime
police
headquarters
earlier
this
evening
tortha
karf
face
appeared
on
the
screen
his
voice
began
an
announcement
of
how
executive
councilman
salgath
trod
had
called
him
by
visiphone
admitting
to
complicity
in
the
paratemporal
here
is
a
recording
of
councilman
salgath
call
to
me
from
his
apartment
to
my
office
at
this
evening
the
shattered
into
and
rebuilt
itself
salgath
trod
at
his
desk
in
the
library
of
his
apartment
the
and
the
needler
within
reach
appeared
he
began
to
speak
from
time
to
time
the
voice
of
tortha
karf
interrupted
questioning
or
prompting
him
you
understand
that
this
confession
renders
you
liable
to
tortha
karf
asked
yes
councilman
salgath
understood
that
and
you
agree
to
come
voluntarily
to
paratime
police
headquarters
and
you
will
voluntarily
undergo
interrogation
yes
salgath
trod
agreed
to
that
i
am
now
terminating
the
playback
of
councilman
salgath
call
to
me
tortha
karf
said
on
the
screen
at
this
point
councilman
salgath
began
making
a
statement
about
his
criminal
activities
which
we
have
on
record
because
he
named
a
number
of
his
criminal
associates
whom
we
have
no
intention
of
warning
this
portion
of
councilman
salgath
call
can
not
at
this
time
be
made
public
we
have
no
intention
of
having
any
of
these
suspects
escape
or
of
giving
their
associates
an
opportunity
to
murder
them
to
prevent
their
furnishing
us
with
additional
information
incidentally
there
was
an
attempt
made
on
the
landing
stage
of
paratime
police
headquarters
to
murder
councilman
salgath
when
he
was
brought
here
guarded
by
paratime
police
officers
he
went
on
to
give
a
colorful
and
as
far
as
possible
truthful
account
of
the
attack
by
the
two
and
their
as
he
told
it
however
all
three
had
been
killed
before
they
could
accomplish
their
purpose
one
of
them
by
salgath
trod
himself
the
image
of
tortha
karf
was
replaced
by
a
view
of
the
three
assassins
lying
on
the
landing
stage
they
all
looked
dead
even
the
one
who
was
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
was
merely
drugged
then
one
after
another
their
faces
were
shown
in
closeup
while
tortha
karf
asked
for
close
attention
and
memorization
we
believe
that
these
men
were
fifth
level
proles
we
think
that
they
were
under
hypnotic
influence
or
obeying
posthypnotic
commands
when
they
made
their
suicidal
attack
if
any
of
you
have
ever
seen
any
of
these
men
before
it
is
your
duty
to
inform
the
paratime
police
that
ended
it
tortha
karf
pressed
a
button
in
front
of
him
and
the
screen
went
dark
the
spectators
relaxed
well
nothing
like
being
sincere
with
the
public
is
there
della
commented
i
remember
this
the
next
time
i
tune
in
a
management
public
statement
in
about
five
minutes
one
of
the
said
all
hell
is
going
to
break
loose
i
think
the
whole
thing
is
crazy
i
hope
you
have
somebody
who
can
give
a
convincing
impersonation
lovranth
rolk
said
yes
a
field
agent
named
kostran
galth
tortha
karf
said
we
ran
the
personal
description
cards
for
the
whole
force
through
the
machine
kostran
checked
to
within
of
one
per
cent
on
police
terminal
now
coming
by
rocket
from
ravvanan
equivalent
we
ought
to
have
the
whole
thing
ready
for
telecast
by
tomorrow
he
ca
learn
to
imitate
salgath
voice
convincingly
in
that
time
with
all
the
work
the
cosmeticians
have
to
be
doing
on
him
dalla
said
make
up
a
tape
of
salgath
own
voice
out
of
that
pile
of
recordings
we
got
at
his
apartment
and
what
we
can
get
out
of
the
news
file
vall
said
we
have
phoneticists
who
can
split
syllables
and
splice
them
together
kostran
will
deliver
his
speech
in
and
dub
the
sound
in
and
telecast
them
as
one
i
messaged
polterm
to
get
to
work
on
that
they
can
start
as
soon
as
we
have
the
speech
written
illustration
the
more
it
succeeds
now
the
worse
the
will
be
when
we
finally
have
to
admit
that
salgath
was
killed
here
tonight
the
chief
coördinator
zostha
olv
said
we
better
have
something
to
show
the
public
to
justify
that
yes
we
had
tortha
karf
agreed
vall
how
about
the
kholghoor
sector
operation
how
far
ranthar
jard
gotten
toward
locating
one
of
those
wizard
trader
time
lines
not
very
far
vall
admitted
he
has
it
pinned
down
to
the
but
the
belt
seems
to
be
one
we
have
any
information
at
all
for
never
been
any
legitimate
penetration
by
paratimers
he
has
his
own
hagiologists
and
a
couple
borrowed
from
outtime
religious
institute
they
gotten
everything
the
slaves
can
give
them
on
that
about
the
only
thing
to
do
is
start
random
observation
with
over
about
a
hundred
thousand
time
lines
zostha
olv
scoffed
he
was
an
old
man
even
for
his
race
he
had
a
thin
nose
and
a
narrow
bitter
mouth
and
what
will
he
look
for
croutha
with
guns
tortha
karf
told
him
then
turned
to
vall
he
narrow
it
more
than
that
what
have
his
experts
been
getting
out
of
those
slaves
that
i
do
know
to
date
vall
looked
at
the
clock
i
find
out
though
i
transpose
to
police
terminal
and
call
him
up
and
skordran
kirv
no
vulthor
tharn
it
hurt
the
old
fellow
feelings
if
i
him
and
went
to
one
of
his
subordinates
half
an
hour
each
way
and
at
most
another
hour
talking
to
ranthar
and
vulthor
there
wo
be
anything
doing
here
for
two
hours
he
rose
see
you
when
i
get
back
dalla
had
turned
on
the
telescreen
again
after
tuning
out
a
dance
orchestra
and
a
comedy
show
she
got
the
image
of
an
man
in
evening
clothes
and
i
going
to
demand
a
full
investigation
as
soon
as
council
convenes
tomorrow
morning
he
was
shouting
this
whole
story
is
a
preposterous
insult
to
the
integrity
of
the
entire
executive
council
your
elected
representatives
and
it
shows
the
criminal
lengths
to
which
this
dictator
tortha
karf
and
his
jackal
verkan
vall
will
go
so
long
jackal
dalla
called
to
him
as
he
went
out
he
spent
the
transposition
to
police
terminal
sleeping
and
seemed
to
be
his
only
chance
to
get
any
sleep
he
was
still
sleepy
when
he
sat
down
in
front
of
the
radio
telescreen
behind
his
duplicate
of
tortha
karf
desk
and
put
through
a
call
to
nharkan
equivalent
it
was
in
india
the
sector
regional
deputy
subchief
who
was
holding
down
ranthar
desk
looked
equally
sleepy
he
had
a
mug
of
coffee
in
front
of
him
and
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
oh
hello
assistant
verkan
want
me
to
call
subchief
ranthar
is
he
sleeping
then
for
mercy
sake
do
what
the
present
status
of
the
investigation
well
we
were
dropping
boomerang
balls
yesterday
while
we
had
sun
to
mask
the
nothing
the
croutha
have
taken
the
city
of
sohram
just
below
the
big
bend
of
the
river
tomorrow
when
we
have
sunlight
we
going
to
start
the
central
square
we
may
get
something
the
wizard
traders
be
moving
in
near
there
about
now
vall
said
the
croutha
ought
to
have
plenty
of
merchandise
for
them
have
you
gotten
anything
more
done
on
narrowing
down
the
possible
area
the
deputy
bit
back
a
yawn
and
reached
for
his
coffee
mug
the
experts
have
just
about
pumped
these
slaves
empty
he
said
the
local
religion
is
a
mess
seems
to
have
started
out
as
a
great
mother
cult
then
it
picked
up
a
lot
of
gods
borrowed
from
other
peoples
then
it
turned
into
a
dualistic
monotheism
then
it
picked
up
a
lot
of
minor
gods
and
devils
new
devils
usually
gods
of
the
older
pantheon
and
we
got
a
lot
of
gossip
about
the
feudal
wars
and
among
the
nobility
and
so
on
all
garbled
because
these
people
are
peasants
who
only
knew
what
went
on
on
the
estate
of
their
own
lord
what
did
go
on
there
vall
asked
ask
them
about
recent
improvements
new
buildings
new
fields
cleared
new
paddies
flooded
that
sort
of
thing
and
pick
out
a
few
of
the
highest
iq
from
both
time
lines
and
have
them
locate
this
estate
on
a
map
and
draw
plans
showing
the
location
of
buildings
fields
and
other
visible
features
if
you
have
to
teach
them
mapping
and
sketching
by
and
then
drop
about
five
hundred
to
a
thousand
boomerang
balls
at
regular
intervals
over
the
whole
paratemporal
area
when
you
locate
a
time
line
that
gives
you
a
picture
to
correspond
to
their
description
boomerang
the
main
square
in
sohram
over
the
whole
belt
around
it
to
find
croutha
with
firearms
the
deputy
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
then
gulped
more
coffee
can
do
assistant
verkan
i
think
i
send
somebody
to
wake
up
subchief
ranthar
right
now
want
to
talk
to
him
wo
be
necessary
you
recording
this
call
of
course
then
play
it
back
to
him
and
get
cracking
with
the
slaves
you
want
enough
information
out
of
them
to
enable
you
to
start
boomerang
balling
as
soon
as
the
sun
high
enough
he
broke
off
the
connection
and
sent
out
for
coffee
for
himself
then
he
put
through
a
call
to
novilan
equivalent
in
western
north
america
it
was
there
when
he
got
vulthor
tharn
on
the
screen
good
afternoon
assistant
verkan
i
suppose
you
calling
about
the
slave
business
i
turned
the
entire
matter
over
to
field
agent
skordran
gave
him
a
temporary
rank
of
deputy
subchief
that
subject
to
your
approval
and
chief
tortha
of
course
make
the
appointment
permanent
vall
said
i
have
a
confirmation
along
from
chief
tortha
directly
and
let
me
talk
to
him
now
if
you
please
subchief
vulthor
yes
sir
switching
you
over
now
the
screen
went
into
a
beautiful
burst
of
abstract
art
and
cleared
after
a
while
with
skordran
kirv
looking
out
of
it
hello
deputy
skordran
and
congratulations
what
come
up
since
we
had
cut
out
from
under
us
we
went
in
on
that
time
line
that
same
night
with
an
airboat
and
made
a
recon
in
the
hills
back
of
careba
scared
the
fear
of
safar
into
a
party
of
caleras
while
we
were
working
at
low
altitude
by
the
way
we
found
the
site
circle
with
all
the
grass
and
loose
dirt
transposed
off
it
and
a
pole
pen
very
unsanitary
where
about
hundred
slaves
would
be
kept
at
a
time
no
indications
of
use
in
the
last
ten
days
we
did
some
pretty
thorough
boomeranging
on
that
spatial
equivalent
over
a
couple
of
thousand
time
lines
and
found
thirty
more
of
them
i
believe
the
slavers
have
closed
out
the
whole
esaron
sector
operation
at
least
temporarily
that
was
what
he
been
afraid
of
he
hoped
they
would
do
the
same
thing
on
the
kholghoor
sector
let
me
have
the
designations
of
the
time
lines
on
which
you
found
conveyer
heads
he
said
just
a
moment
chief
assistant
i
photoprint
them
to
you
set
for
reception
vall
opened
a
slide
under
the
screen
and
saw
that
the
photoprint
film
was
in
place
then
closed
it
again
nodding
skordran
kirv
fed
a
sheet
of
paper
into
his
screen
cabinet
and
his
arm
moved
forward
out
of
the
picture
on
sir
he
said
he
and
vall
counted
ten
seconds
together
and
then
skordran
kirv
said
through
to
you
vall
pressed
a
lever
under
his
screen
and
a
rectangle
of
microcopy
print
popped
out
that
about
all
i
have
sir
want
me
to
keep
my
troops
ready
here
or
shall
i
send
them
somewhere
else
keep
them
ready
kirv
vall
told
him
you
may
need
them
before
long
call
you
later
he
put
the
microcopy
in
an
enlarger
and
carried
the
enlarged
print
with
him
to
the
conveyer
room
there
was
something
odd
about
the
list
of
time
line
designations
they
were
expressed
numerically
in
first
level
notation
extremely
short
groups
of
symbols
capable
of
exact
expression
of
almost
inconceivably
enormous
numbers
vall
had
only
a
smattering
of
mathematics
enough
to
qualify
him
for
the
chair
of
higher
mathematics
at
any
university
on
say
the
fourth
level
sector
and
he
could
not
identify
the
peculiarity
but
he
could
recognize
that
there
existed
some
sort
of
pattern
shoving
in
the
starting
lever
he
relaxed
in
one
of
the
chairs
waiting
for
the
transposition
field
to
build
up
around
him
and
fell
asleep
before
the
mesh
dome
of
the
conveyer
had
vanished
he
woke
the
list
of
time
line
designations
in
his
hand
when
the
conveyor
rematerialized
on
home
time
line
putting
it
in
his
pocket
he
hurried
to
an
antigrav
shaft
and
floated
up
to
the
floor
on
which
tortha
karf
office
was
tortha
karf
was
asleep
in
his
chair
dalla
was
eating
a
dinner
that
had
been
brought
in
to
her
something
better
than
the
sandwich
and
mug
of
coffee
vall
had
mentioned
to

several
of
the
bureau
chiefs
who
had
been
there
when
he
had
gone
out
had
left
and
the
psychist
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
prisoner
was
there
i
think
he
coming
out
of
the
drug
now
he
reported
still
asleep
though
we
want
him
to
waken
naturally
before
we
start
on
him
they
call
me
as
soon
as
he
shows
signs
of
stirring
the
opposition
claiming
now
that
we
drugged
and
hypnotized
salgath
into
making
that
visiscreen
confession
dalla
said
can
you
think
of
any
way
you
could
do
that
without
making
the
subject
incapable
of
lying
the
psychist
said
it
would
take
about
three
times
as
long
as
the
time
between
salgath
trod
departure
from
his
apartment
and
the
time
of
the
telecast
though
you
know
much
higher
math
vall
asked
the
psychist
well
enough
to
handle
my
job
patterns
that
kind
of
thing
all
have
to
be
expressed
mathematically
vall
nodded
and
handed
him
the
designation
list
see
any
kind
of
a
pattern
there
he
asked
the
psychist
looked
at
the
paper
and
blanked
his
face
as
he
drew
on
information
yes
i
say
that
all
the
numbers
are
related
in
some
kind
of
a
series
to
some
other
number
simplified
down
to
kindergarten
level
say
the
difference
between
a
and
b
is
maybe
of
the
difference
between
x
and
a
and
the
difference
between
b
and
c
is
of
the
difference
between
x
and
b
and
so
on
a
voice
came
out
of
one
of
the
communication
boxes
nentrov
the
patient
out
of
the
drug
and
he
beginning
to
stir
about
that
it
the
psychist
said
i
have
to
run
he
handed
the
sheet
back
to
vall
took
a
last
drink
from
his
coffee
cup
and
bolted
out
of
the
room
dalla
picked
up
the
sheet
of
paper
and
looked
at
it
vall
told
her
what
it
was
if
those
time
lines
are
in
regular
series
they
relate
to
the
base
line
of
operations
she
said
maybe
you
can
have
that
worked
out
i
can
see
how
it
would
be
a
stated
interval
between
the
esaron
sector
lines
to
simplify
transposition
control
settings
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
it
not
quite
as
simple
as
nentrov
expressed
it
but
that
could
be
the
general
idea
we
might
be
able
to
work
out
the
location
of
the
base
line
from
that
there
seems
to
be
a
break
in
the
number
sequence
in
here
that
would
be
the
time
line
skordran
kirv
found
those
slaves
on
he
reached
for
the
pipe
he
had
left
on
the
desk
when
he
had
gone
to
police
terminal
and
began
filling
it
a
little
later
a
buzzer
sounded
and
a
light
came
on
on
one
of
the
communication
boxes
he
flipped
the
switch
and
said
verkan
vall
here
sothran
barth
voice
came
cut
of
the
box
they
just
brought
in
salgath
trod
servants
picked
them
up
as
they
came
out
of
the
house
conveyer
at
the
apartment
building
i
believe
they
know
what
happened
vall
flipped
a
switch
and
twiddled
a
dial
a
viewscreen
lit
up
showing
the
landing
stage
the
police
car
had
just
landed
one
detective
had
gotten
out
and
was
helping
the
girl
zinganna
who
had
been
salgath
trod
housekeeper
and
mistress
to
descend
she
was
really
beautiful
vall
thought
rather
tall
slender
with
dark
eyes
and
a
creamy
skin
she
wore
a
black
cloak
and
under
it
a
black
and
silver
evening
gown
a
single
jewel
twinkled
in
her
black
hair
she
could
have
very
easily
passed
for
a
woman
of
his
own
race
the
housemaid
and
the
butler
were
a
couple
of
entirely
different
articles
both
were
about
four
or
five
generations
from
fourth
level
primitive
savagery
the
maid
in
garishly
cheap
finery
was
and
with
hair
she
looked
like
a
member
of
one
of
the
northern
european
peoples
who
had
barely
managed
to
progress
as
far
as
the
bow
and
arrow
the
butler
was
probably
a
mixture
of
half
a
dozen
primitive
races
he
was
wearing
one
of
his
late
master
evening
suits
a
bright
which
was
distinctly
unflattering
to
his
complexion
the
was
too
far
away
to
give
him
what
they
were
saying
but
the
butler
and
maid
were
waving
their
arms
and
protesting
vehemently
one
of
the
detectives
took
the
woman
by
the
arm
she
jerked
it
loose
and
aimed
a
backhand
slap
at
him
he
blocked
it
on
his
forearm
immediately
the
girl
in
black
turned
and
said
something
to
her
and
she
subsided
vall
said
into
the
box
barth
have
the
girl
in
the
black
cloak
brought
down
to
number
four
interview
room
put
the
other
two
in
separate
detention
cubicles
we
talk
to
them
later
he
broke
the
connection
and
got
to
his
feet
come
on
dalla
i
want
you
to
help
me
with
the
girl
just
try
and
stop
me
dalla
told
him
any
interviews
you
have
with
that
little
item
i
want
to
sit
in
on
the
proletarian
girl
still
guarded
by
a
detective
had
already
been
placed
in
the
interview
room
the
detective
nodded
to
vall
tried
to
suppress
a
grin
when
he
saw
dalla
behind
him
and
went
out
vall
saw
his
wife
and
the
prisoner
seated
and
produced
his
cigarette
case
handing
it
around
you
zinganna
you
of
the
household
of
councilman
salgath
trod
are
you
he
asked
housekeeper
and
hostess
the
girl
replied
i
am
also
his
mistress
vall
nodded
smiling
which
confirms
my
respect
for
councilman
salgath
exquisite
taste
why
thank
you
she
said
but
i
doubt
if
i
was
brought
here
to
receive
compliments
or
was
i
no
i
afraid
not
have
you
heard
the
newscasts
of
the
past
few
hours
concerning
councilman
salgath
she
straightened
in
her
seat
looking
at
him
seriously
no
i
and
nindrandigro
and
calilla
spent
the
evening
on
servsec
councilman
salgath
told
me
that
he
had
some
business
and
wanted
them
out
of
the
apartment
and
wanted
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
we
did
hear
any
news
at
all
she
hesitated
has
anything
serious
happened
vall
studied
her
for
a
moment
then
glanced
at
dalla
there
existed
between
himself
and
his
wife
a
sort
of
vague
semitelepathic
rapport
they
had
never
been
able
to
transmit
definite
and
exact
thoughts
but
they
could
clearly
prehend
one
another
feelings
and
emotions
he
was
conscious
now
of
dalla
sympathy
for
the
proletarian
girl
zinganna
i
going
to
tell
you
something
that
is
being
kept
from
the
public
he
said
by
doing
so
i
will
make
it
necessary
for
us
to
detain
you
at
least
for
a
few
days
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
but
i
think
you
would
forgive
me
less
if
i
did
tell
you
something
happened
to
him
she
said
her
eyes
widening
and
her
body
tensing
yes
zinganna
at
about
this
evening
he
said
councilman
salgath
was
murdered
oh
she
leaned
back
in
the
chair
closing
her
eyes
he
dead
then
again
statement
instead
of
question
he
dead
for
a
long
moment
she
lay
back
in
the
chair
as
though
trying
to
reorient
her
mind
to
the
fact
of
salgath
trod
death
while
vall
and
dalla
sat
watching
her
then
she
stirred
opened
her
eyes
looked
at
the
cigarette
in
her
fingers
as
though
she
had
never
seen
it
before
and
leaned
forward
to
stuff
it
into
an
ash
receiver
who
did
it
she
asked
the
stone
age
savage
who
had
been
her
ancestor
not
ten
generations
ago
peeping
out
of
her
eyes
the
men
who
actually
used
the
needlers
are
dead
vall
told
her
i
killed
a
couple
of
them
myself
we
still
have
to
find
the
men
who
planned
it
i
hoped
you
want
to
help
us
do
that
zinganna
he
to
dalla
again
she
nodded
the
relationship
between
zinganna
and
salgath
trod
had
been
purely
business
with
her
there
had
been
some
real
affection
he
told
her
what
had
happened
and
when
he
reached
the
point
at
which
salgath
trod
had
called
tortha
karf
to
confess
complicity
in
the
slave
trade
her
lips
tightened
and
she
nodded
i
was
afraid
it
was
something
like
that
she
said
for
the
last
few
days
well
ever
since
the
news
about
the
slave
trade
got
out
been
worried
about
something
i
always
thought
somebody
had
some
kind
of
a
hold
over
him
different
times
in
the
past
he
done
things
so
far
against
his
own
political
best
interests
that
i
had
to
believe
he
was
being
forced
into
them
well
this
time
they
tried
to
force
him
too
far
what
then
vall
continued
the
story
so
we
keeping
this
hushed
up
for
a
while
the
way
we
letting
it
out
salgath
trod
is
still
alive
on
police
terminal
talking
under
she
smiled
savagely
and
they
get
frightened
and
frightened
men
do
foolish
things
she
finished
she
had
been
a
mistress
for
nothing
what
can
i
do
to
help
tell
us
everything
you
can
he
said
maybe
we
can
be
able
to
take
such
actions
as
we
would
have
taken
if
salgath
trod
had
lived
to
talk
to
us
yes
of
course
she
got
another
cigarette
from
the
case
vall
had
laid
on
the
table
i
think
though
that
you
better
give
me
a
you
want
to
be
able
to
depend
on
what
i
going
to
tell
you
and
i
want
to
be
able
to
remember
things
exactly
vall
nodded
approvingly
and
turned
to
dalla
can
you
handle
this
yourself
he
asked
there
an
recorder
on
now
here
everything
you
need
he
opened
the
drawers
in
the
table
to
show
her
the
equipment
and
the
phone
has
a
whisper
mouthpiece
you
can
call
out
without
worrying
about
your
message
getting
into
zinganna
subconscious
well
i
see
you
when
you
through
you
bring
zinganna
to
police
terminal
i
probably
be
there
he
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
went
down
the
hall
meeting
the
officer
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
butler
and
housemaid
we
having
trouble
with
them
sir
he
said
hostile
yelling
about
their
rights
and
demanding
to
see
a
representative
of
proletarian
protective
league
vall
mentioned
the
proletarian
protective
league
with
unflattering
vulgarity
if
they
do
coöperate
drag
them
out
and
inject
them
and
question
them
anyhow
he
said
the
looked
worried
we
been
taking
a
pretty
high
hand
with
them
as
it
is
he
protested
it
safer
to
kill
a
citizen
than
bloody
a
prole
nose
they
have
all
sorts
of
laws
to
protect
them
there
are
all
sorts
of
laws
to
protect
the
paratime
secret
vall
replied
and
i
think
there
are
one
or
two
laws
against
murdering
members
of
the
executive
council
in
case
makes
any
trouble
they
are
here
they
have
faithfully
joined
their
beloved
master
in
his
refuge
on
polterm
but
one
or
both
of
them
work
for
the
organization
you
sure
of
that
the
organization
is
too
thorough
not
to
have
had
a
spy
in
household
it
was
zinganna
because
she
volunteered
to
talk
to
us
under
so
who
does
that
leave
well
that
different
that
makes
them
suspects
the
lieutenant
seemed
relieved
we
pump
that
pair
out
right
away
when
he
got
back
to
tortha
karf
office
the
chief
was
awake
and
doodling
on
his
notepad
with
his
multicolor
pen
vall
looked
at
the
pad
and
winced
the
chief
was
doodling
bugs
again
red
ants
with
black
legs
and
beetles
then
he
saw
that
the
psychist
nentrov
dard
was
drinking
straight
well
tell
me
the
worst
he
said
our
boy
nentrov
dard
said
draining
his
glass
and
filling
it
again
and
he
plastered
with
a
foot
thick
it
be
five
or
six
before
we
can
get
all
that
stuff
peeled
off
and
get
him
unblocked
i
put
him
to
sleep
and
had
him
transposed
to
police
terminal
i
going
there
myself
tomorrow
morning
after
i
had
some
sleep
and
get
to
work
on
him
if
hoping
to
get
anything
useful
out
of
him
in
time
to
head
off
this
council
crisis
that
building
up
just
forget
it
and
that
leaves
us
right
back
with
our
old
friends
the
wizard
traders
tortha
karf
added
and
if
they
decided
to
suspend
activities
on
the
kholghoor
sector
too
he
began
drawing
a
big
blue
and
black
spider
in
the
middle
of
the
pad
nentrov
dard
crushed
out
his
cigar
drank
his
rum
and
got
to
his
feet
well
good
night
chief
vall
if
you
decide
to
wake
me
up
before
send
somebody
you
want
to
get
rid
of
in
a
hurry
he
walked
around
the
deck
and
out
the
side
door
i
hope
they
do
vall
said
to
tortha
karf
really
though
i
doubt
if
they
do
this
is
their
chance
to
pick
up
a
lot
of
slaves
cheaply
the
croutha
are
too
busy
to
bother
haggling
i
going
through
to
polterm
now
when
dalla
and
zinganna
get
through
tell
them
to
join
me
there
on
police
terminal
he
found
kostran
galth
the
agent
who
had
been
selected
to
impersonate
salgath
trod
after
calling
zulthran
torv
the
mathematician
in
charge
of
the
computer
office
and
giving
him
the
esaron
designations
and
nentrov
dard
ideas
about
them
he
spent
about
an
hour
briefing
kostran
galth
on
the
role
he
was
to
play
finally
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
on
a
couch
in
the
rest
room
behind
the
office
it
was
noon
when
he
woke
after
showering
shaving
and
dressing
hastily
he
went
out
to
the
desk
for
breakfast
which
arrived
while
he
was
putting
a
call
through
to
ranthar
jard
at
nharkan
equivalent
your
idea
paid
off
chief
assistant
the
kholghoor
secreg
subchief
told
him
the
slaves
gave
us
a
lot
of
physical
description
data
on
the
estate
and
told
us
about
new
fields
that
had
been
cleared
and
a
dam
this
lord
ghromdour
was
building
to
flood
some
new
we
located
a
belt
of
about
five
parayears
where
these
improvements
had
been
made
we
started
boomeranging
the
whole
belt
time
line
by
time
line
so
far
we
have
ten
or
fifteen
pictures
of
the
main
square
at
sohram
showing
croutha
with
firearms
and
pictures
of
wizard
trader
camps
and
conveyer
heads
on
the
same
time
lines
here
let
me
show
you
this
is
from
an
airboat
over
the
forest
outside
the
equivalent
of
sohram
there
was
no
jungle
visible
when
the
view
changed
nothing
but
clusters
of
steel
towers
and
platforms
and
buildings
that
marked
conveyer
heads
and
a
large
rectangle
of
moored
to
warn
air
traffic
out
of
the
area
being
boomeranged
the
pickup
seemed
to
be
pointed
downward
from
the
bow
of
an
airboat
circling
at
about
ten
thousand
feet
balls
ready
to
go
a
voice
called
and
then
repeated
a
string
of
designations
estimated
return
give
or
take
four
minutes
varth
ranthar

said
evidently
out
of
the
boat
radio
your
telecast
is
being
beamed
on
dhergabar
equivalent
chief
assistant
verkan
is
watching
when
do
you
estimate
your
next
return
any
moment
now
sir
we
holding
this
drop
till
they
rematerialize
vall
watched
unblinkingly
his
fork
poised
halfway
to
his
mouth
suddenly
about
a
thousand
feet
below
the
eye
of
the
pickup
there
was
a
series
of
blue
flashes
and
an
instant
later
a
blossoming
of
parachutes
ejected
from
the
balls
that
had
returned
from
the
kholghoor
sector
all
right
drop
away
the
boat
captain
called
there
was
a
gush
from
underneath
of
spheres
their
twinkling
in
the
sunlight
they
dropped
in
a
tight
cluster
for
a
thousand
or
so
feet
and
then
flashed
and
vanished
from
the
ground
six
or
eight
aircars
rose
to
meet
the
descending
parachutes
and
catch
them
the
screen
went
cubist
for
a
moment
and
then
ranthar
jard
swarthy
face
looked
out
of
it
again
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
we
probably
get
a
positive
out
of
the
batch
you
just
saw
coming
in
he
said
we
get
one
out
of
about
every
two

he
working
on
the
esaron
sector
dope
we
think
a
pattern
can
be
established
i
be
seeing
you
in
about
five
hours
i
rocketing
out

here
as
soon
as
i
get
a
few
more
things
cleared
up

zulthran
torv
normally
cautious
to
the
degree
of
pessimism
was
jubilant
when
vall
called
him
we
have
something
vall
he
said
it
is
roughly
what
nentrov
suggested
each
of
the
intervals
between
the
designations
is
a
very
minute
but
very
exact
fraction
of
the
difference
between
lesser
designation
and
the
designation
you
have
the
designation
vall
demanded
oh
yes
that
what
i
was
telling
you
we
worked
that
out
from
the
designations
you
gave
me
he
recited
it
all
the
designations
you
gave
me
are
vall
was
listening
to
him
he
frowned
in
puzzlement
that
not
a
fifth
level
designation
he
said
that
first
level
that
correct
first
level
abzar
sector
now
why
in
blazes
did
anybody
think
of
that
before
he
marveled
and
as
he
did
he
knew
the
answer
nobody
ever
thought
of
the
abzar
sector
illustration
twelve
millennia
ago
the
world
of
the
first
level
had
been
exhausted
having
used
up
the
resources
of
their
home
planet
mars
a
hundred
thousand
years
before
the
descendants
of
the
population
that
had
migrated
across
space
had
repeated
on
the
third
planet
the
devastation
of
the
fourth
the
ancestors
of
verkan
vall
people
had
discovered
the
principle
of
paratime
transposition
and
had
begun
to
exploit
an
infinity
of
worlds
on
other
lines
of
probability
the
people
of
the
first
level
dwarma
sector
reduced
by
sheer
starvation
to
a
tiny
handful
had
abandoned
their
cities
and
renounced
their
technologies
and
created
for
themselves
a
culture
without
progress
or
change
or
curiosity
or
struggle
or
ambition
and
a
way
of
life
in
which
every
day
was
like
every
other
day
that
had
been
or
that
would
come
the
abzar
people
had
done
neither
they
had
wasted
their
resources
to
the
last
fighting
bitterly
over
the
ultimate
crumbs
with
fission
bombs
and
with
muskets
and
with
swords
and
with
spears
and
clubs
and
finally
they
had
died
out
leaving
a
planet
of
almost
uniform
desert
dotted
with
vast
empty
cities
which
even
twelve
thousand
years
had
hardly
begun
to
obliterate
so
nobody
on
the
paratime
sector
went
to
the
abzar
sector
there
was
nothing
there
except
a
well
message
that
to
subchief
ranthar
jard
kholghoor
sector
at
nharkan
equivalent
and
to
subchief
vulthor
esaron
sector
novilan
equivalent
vall
said
and
be
sure
to
mark
what
you
send
vulthor
attention
deputy
subchief
skordran
that
reminded
him
of
something
as
soon
as
he
was
through
with
zulthran
he
got
out
an
order
in
the
name
of
tortha
karf
authorizing
skordran
kirv
promotion
on
a
permanent
basis
and
messaged
it
out
something
was
going
to
have
to
be
done
with
vulthor
tharn
too
a
promotion
of
course
say
deputy
bureau
chief
tape
library
at
dhergabar
home
time
line
there
vulthor
passion
for
procedure
and
his
caution
would
be
assets
instead
of
liabilities
he
called
vlasthor
arph
the
chief
deputy
assigned
to
him
as
adjutant
i
want
more
troops
from
servsec
and
indsec
he
said
go
over
the
to
and
see
what
can
be
spared
from
where
do
strip
any
time
line
but
get
a
force
of
the
order
of
about
three
divisions
and
locate
all
the
big
ship
transposition
docks
on
commercial
and
passenger
sectors
and
a
list
of
freighters
and
passenger
ships
that
can
be
commandeered
in
a
hurry
we
think
we
spotted
the
time
line
the
organization
using
as
a
base
as
soon
as
we
raid
a
couple
of
places
near
nharkan
and
novilan
equivalents
we
going
to
move
in
for
a
cleanup
i
get
it
chief
assistant
i
do
everything
i
can
to
get
ready
for
a
big
move
without
letting
anything
leak
out
after
you
strike
the
first
blow
there
wo
be
any
security
problem
and
the
lid
will
be
off
in
the
meantime
i
make
up
a
general
plan
and
alert
all
our
own
people
right
right
and
for
your
information
the
base
is
fifth
level
first
level
abzar
he
gave
the
designation
vlasthor
arph
chuckled
well
think
of
that
i
even
forgotten
there
was
an
abzar
sector
shall
i
tell
the
reporters
that
fangs
of
fasif
no
vall
fairly
howled
then
curiously
what
reporters
how
they
get
onto
polterm
about
fifty
or
sixty
people
chief
tortha
sent
down
here
this
morning
with
orders
to
prevent
them
from
filing
any
stories
from
here
but
to
let
them
cover
the
raids
when
they
come
off
we
were
instructed
to
furnish
them
weapons
and
equipment
and
vocowriters
and
anything
else
they
needed
and
vall
grinned
that
was
one
i
never
thought
of
he
admitted
the
old
fox
is
still
the
old
fox
no
tell
them
nothing
we
just
take
them
along
and
show
them
oh
and
where
are
hadron
dalla
and
that
girl
of
salgath
trod
they
sleeping
now
rest
room
eighteen
dalla
and
zinganna
were
asleep
on
a
big
mound
of
silk
cushions
in
one
corner
their
glossy
black
heads
close
together
and
zinganna
brown
arm
around
dalla
white
shoulder
their
faces
were
calmly
beautiful
in
repose
and
they
smiled
slightly
as
though
they
were
wandering
through
a
happy
dream
for
a
little
while
vall
stood
looking
at
them
then
he
began
whistling
softly
on
the
third
or
fourth
bar
dalla
woke
and
sat
up
waking
zinganna
and
blinked
at
him
perplexedly
what
time
is
it
she
asked
about
he
told
her
ohhh
we
just
got
to
sleep
she
said
we
both
bushed
you
had
a
hard
time
feel
all
right
after
your
zinganna
it
was
so
bad
and
i
had
a
nice
sleep
and
dalla
hadron
i

dalla
vall
wife
corrected
remember
what
i
told
you
dalla
then
zinganna
smiled
dalla
gave
me
some
too
i
do
feel
so
badly
about
trod
any
more
well
look
zinganna
we
going
to
have
a
man
impersonate
councilman
salgath
on
a
telecast
the
cosmeticians
are
making
him
over
now
would
you
find
it
too
painful
to
meet
him
and
talk
to
him
no
i
would
mind
i
can
criticize
the
impersonation
remember
i
knew
trod
very
well
you
know
i
was
his
hostess
too
i
met
many
of
the
people
with
whom
he
was
associated
and
they
know
me
would
things
look
more
convincing
if
i
appeared
on
the
telecast
with
your
man
it
certainly
would
it
would
be
a
great
help
he
told
her
enthusiastically
maybe
you
girls
ought
to
get
up
now
the
telecast
is
till
but
there
a
lot
to
be
done
getting
ready
dalla
yawned
what
i
get
trying
to
be
a
cop
she
said
then
caught
the
other
girl
hands
and
rose
pulling
her
up
come
on
zinna
we
have
to
get
to
work
vall
rose
from
behind
the
in
ranthar
jard
office
stretching
his
arms
over
his
head
for
almost
an
hour
he
had
sat
there
pushing
buttons
and
twiddling
selector
and
knobs
looking
at
the
pictures
the
cops
had
taken
with
balls
dropped
over
the
spatial
equivalent
of
sohram
one
set
of
pictures
taken
at
two
thousand
feet
showed
the
central
square
of
the
city
the
effects
of
the
croutha
sack
were
plainly
visible
so
were
the
captives
herded
together
under
guard
like
cattle
by
increasing
magnification
he
looked
at
groups
of
the
barbarian
conquerors
big
men
with
blond
or
hair
in
loose
shirts
and
baggy
trousers
and
rough
cowhide
buskins
many
of
them
wore
helmets
some
had
shirts
of
all
of
them
carried
long
straight
swords
with
and
about
half
of
them
had
pistols
thrust
through
their
belts
or
muskets
slung
from
their
shoulders
the
other
set
of
pictures
showed
the
wizard
trader
camps
and
conveyer
heads
in
each
case
a
wide
oval
had
been
burned
out
in
the
jungle
probably
with
heat
guns
the
camps
were
surrounded
with
stout
fence
in
each
there
were
a
number
of
metal
and
an
inner
fenced
a
trail
had
been
cut
from
each
to
a
similarly
cleared
circle
farther
back
in
the
forest
and
in
the
centers
of
one
or
two
of
these
circles
he
saw
the
actual
conveyer
domes
there
was
a
great
deal
of
activity
in
all
of
them
and
he
screwed
the
to
the
limit
to
scrutinize
each
human
figure
in
turn
a
few
of
the
men
he
was
sure
were
first
level
citizens
more
were
either
proles
or
outtimers
quite
a
few
of
them
were
of
a
dark
type
some
of
these
fellows
look
like
second
level
khiftans
he
said
rush
an
individual
picture
of
each
one
maximum
magnification
consistent
with
clarity
to
dhergabar
equivalent
to
be
transposed
to
home
time
line
you
get
all
the
dope
from
zulthran
torv
yes
abzar
sector
ranthar
jard
said
i
never
have
thought
of
that
wonder
why
they
used
that
series
system
though
i
have
tried
to
spot
my
operations
as
completely
at
random
as
possible
only
thing
they
could
have
done
vall
said
when
we
get
hold
of
one
of
their
conveyers
we
going
to
find
the
control
panel
just
a
mess
of
arbitrary
symbols
and
there
be
something
like
a
built
into
the
control
cabinet
to
select
the
right
time
line
whenever
a
dial
set
or
a
button
pushed
and
the
only
way
that
could
be
done
would
be
by
establishing
some
kind
of
a
numerical
series
and
we
were
trustingly
expecting
to
locate
their
base
from
one
of
their
conveyers
why
if
we
give
all
those
people
in
the
pictures
we
wo
learn
the
designation
none
of
them
will
know
it
they
just
go
where
the
conveyers
take
them
well
we
all
set
now
ranthar
jard
said
i
have
a
plan
of
attack
worked
out
subject
to
your
approval
i
ready
to
start
implementing
it
now
he
glanced
at
his
watch
the
salgath
telecast
is
over
on
home
time
line
and
in
a
little
while
a
transcript
will
be
on
this
time
line
want
to
watch
it
here
sir
the
telecast
screen
in
the
living
room
of
tortha
karf
town
apartment
was
still
on
in
it
a
girl
with
bright
red
hair
danced
slowly
to
soft
music
against
a
background
of
shifting
color
the
four
men
who
sat
in
a
semicircle
facing
it
sipped
their
drinks
and
watched
idly
ought
to
be
getting
some
sort
of
public
reaction
soon
tortha
karf
said
glancing
at
his
watch
well
i
have
to
admit
it
was
done
convincingly
zostha
olv
the
chief
interoffice
coördinator
admitted
grudgingly
i
have
believed
it
if
i
had
known
the
real
facts
shooting
it
against
the
background
of
those
wide
windows
was
smart
lovranth
rolk
said
every
schoolchild
would
recognize
that
view
of
the
rocketport
as
being
on
police
terminal
and
including
that
girl
zinganna
that
was
a
real
masterpiece
i
met
her
a
few
times
elbraz
vark
the
political
liaison
assistant
said
is
she
lovely
good
actress
too
tortha
karf
said
it
not
easy
to
impersonate
yourself
well
kostran
galth
did
a
fine
job
of
acting
too
lovranth
rolk
said
that
was
done
to
perfection
the
distinguished
politician
supported
by
his
loyal
mistress
bravely
facing
the
disgraceful
end
of
his
public
career
you
know
i
believe
i
could
get
that
girl
a
booking
with
one
of
the
big
theatrical
companies
now
that
salgath
dead
she
need
somebody
to
look
after
her
what
sharp
furry
ears
you
have
mr
elbraz
zostha
olv
grunted
the
music
stopped
as
though
cut
off
with
a
knife
and
the
slim
girl
with
the
red
hair
vanished
in
a
shatter
of
many
colors
when
the
screen
cleared
one
of
the
announcers
was
looking
out
of
it
we
interrupt
the
program
for
an
important
newscast
of
a
sensational
development
in
the
salgath
affair
he
said
your
next
speaker
will
be
yandar
yadd
i
thought
you
managed
to
get
that
blabbermouth
transposed
to
polterm
zostha
said
he
would
go
tortha
karf
replied
said
it
was
just
a
trick
to
get
him
off
home
time
line
during
the
council
crisis
yandar
yadd
had
appeared
on
the
screen
as
the
pickup
swung
about
recording
ostensibly
made
by
councilman
salgath
on
police
terminal
time
line
and
telecast
on
home
time
line
an
hour
ago
well
i
do
know
who
he
was
but
i
now
have
positive
proof
that
he
definitely
was
not
salgath
trod
we
sunk
zostha
olv
grunted
he
never
make
a
statement
like
that
unless
he
could
prove
it
something
suspicious
about
the
whole
thing
from
the
beginning
the
newsman
was
saying
so
i
checked
if
you
recall
the
actor
impersonating
salgath
gestured
rather
freely
with
his
hands
in
imitation
of
a
mannerism
of
the
real
salgath
trod
at
one
point
the
ball
of
his
right
thumb
was
presented
directly
to
the
pickup
here
a
still
of
that
scene
he
stepped
aside
revealing
a
viewscreen
behind
him
when
he
pressed
a
button
the
screen
lighted
on
it
was
a
stationary
picture
of
kostran
galth
as
salgath
trod
his
right
hand
raised
in
front
of
him
now
watch
this
i
going
to
step
up
the
magnification
slowly
so
that
you
can
be
sure
there
no
substitution
camera
a
little
closer
trath
the
screen
in
the
background
seemed
to
advance
until
it
filled
the
entire
screen
yandar
yadd
was
still
talking
out
of
the
picture
a
pointer
came
into
the
picture
touching
the
right
thumb
which
grew
larger
and
larger
until
it
was
the
only
thing
visible
now
here
yandar
yadd
voice
continued
any
of
you
who
are
familiar
with
the
ancient
science
of
dactyloscopy
will
recognize
this
thumb
as
having
the
known
as
a
loop
even
with
the
high
degree
of
magnification
possible
with
the
microgrid
screen
we
ca
bring
out
the
individual
ridges
but
the
pattern
is
unmistakable
i
ask
you
to
memorize
that
image
while
i
show
you
another
right
thumb
print
this
time
a
certified
of
the
thumb
print
of
the
real
salgath
trod
the
magnification
was
reduced
a
little
a
card
was
moved
into
the
picture
and
it
was
stepped
up
again
see
this
thumb
print
is
of
the
type
known
as
a
arch
observe
the
difference
that
does
it
zostha
olv
cried
karf
for
the
first
and
last
time
let
me
remind
you
that
i
opposed
this
lunacy
from
the
beginning
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
next
i
suggest
that
we
get
to
headquarters
as
soon
as
we
can
tortha
karf
said
if
we
wait
too
long
we
may
not
be
able
to
get
in
yandar
yadd
was
back
on
the
screen
denouncing
tortha
karf
passionately
tortha
went
over
and
snapped
it
off
i
suggest
we
transpose
to
polterm
lovranth
rolk
said
it
wo
be
so
easy
for
them
to
serve
a
summons
on
us
there
you
can
go
to

if
you
want
to
tortha
karf
retorted
going
to
stay
here
and
fight
back
and
if
they
try
to
serve
me
with
a
summons
they
better
send
a
robot
for
a
process
server
fight
back
zostha
olv
echoed
you

fight
the

the
whole

they
tear
you
into

bits
i
can
hold
them
off
till

to
raid
those
abzar

bases
tortha
karf
said
he
thought
for
a
moment
maybe
this
is
all
for
the
best
after
all
if
it
distracts
the
attention
i
wish
we
could
have
made
a
reconnaissance
ranthar
jard
was
saying
watching
one
of
the
viewscreens
in
which
a
film
taken
from
an
airboat
transposed
to
an
adjoining
abzar
sector
time
line
was
being
shown
the
boat
had
circled
over
the
ganges
a
mere
trickle
between
wide
deeply
cut
banks
and
was
crossing
a
gullied
plain
sparsely
grown
with
thornbush
the
base
ought
to
be
about
there
but
we
have
no
idea
what
sort
of
changes
this
gang
has
made
well
we
could
we
did
dare
take
the
chance
of
it
being
spotted
this
has
to

complete
surprise

be
about
like

other
place

a
few
months

for
four
or
five
months
till
the
croutha

their
surplus
captives

off
that
country
he
added
gesturing
at
the
screen

be
flooded
out
when
the
rains

how
it
suffered
from
there
wo
be
a
thing

your
own
people
better
than

do
beside
this
wo
be
the
last
operation
like
this
next
time
i

stay
on
police
terminal
and
command
from
a
desk
i
want
experience
with
the
outtime
end
of
the
job
and
this
is
the
only
way
i
can
get
it
he
watched
the
four
who
were
working
at
the
big
terrain
board
showing
the
area
of
the
police
terminal
time
line
around
them
they
had
covered
the
miniature
buildings
and
platforms
and
towers
with
a
fine
mesh
at
a
of
fifty
feet
each
intersection
marked
the
location
of
a
conveyer
ball
loaded
with
a
bomb
and
rigged
with
an
automatic
detonator
which
would
explode
it
and
release
the
gas
as
soon
as
it
rematerialized
on
the
abzar
sector
higher
on
stiff
wires
that
raised
them
to
what
represented
three
thousand
feet
were
the
disks
that
stood
for
ten
conveyers
they
would
carry
squads
of
paratime
police
in
aircars
and
air
boats
there
was
a
ring
of
big
conveyers
a
mile
out
they
would
carry
the
armor
and
the
airborne
infantry
and
the
little
scooters
of
the
from
the
service
and
industrial
sectors
directly
over
the
spatial
equivalent
of
the
kholghoor

wizard
conveyers
was
the
single
disk
of
verkan
vall
command
conveyer
at
a
represented
five
thousand
feet
and
in
a
circle
around
it
were
the
five
news
service
conveyers
where
the
he
asked
actually
it
on
antigrav
about
five
miles
north
of
here
one
of
the
girls
said
representationally
about
where
subchief
standing
another
girl
added
a
few
more
bits
to
the
network
that
represented
the
bombs
and
stepped
back
taking
off
her
earphones
everything
in
place
now
assistant
verkan
she
told
him
good
i
going
aboard
now
he
said
you
can
have
it
jard
he
shook
hands
with
ranthar
jard
who
moved
to
the
switch
which
would
activate
all
the
conveyers
simultaneously
and
accepted
the
good
wishes
of
the
girls
at
the
terrain
board
then
he
walked
to
the
dome
of
the
conveyer
with
the
five
news
service
conveyers
surrounding
it
in
as
regular
a
circle
as
the
buildings
and
towers
of
the
regular
conveyer
heads
would
permit
the
members
of
his
own
detail
smoking
and
chatting
outside
saw
him
and
started
moving
inside
so
did
the
news
people
a
speaker
began
yelping
in
a
hundred
voices
all
over
the
area
warning
those
who
were
going
with
the
conveyers
to
get
aboard
he
went
in
through
a
door
between
two
aircars
and
on
to
the
central
going
up
to
a
visiscreen
over
which
somebody
had
crayoned
novilan
eq
it
gave
him
a
view
over
the
shoulder
of
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
field
agent
third
class
of
the
interior
of
a
conveyer
like
his
own
hello
assistant
verkan
a
voice
came
out
of
the
speaker
under
the
screen
as
the
man
moved
his
lips
deputy
skordran
here
assistant
verkan
now
skordran
kirv
moved
in
front
of
the
screen
as
the
operator
got
up
from
his
stool
hello
vall
we
all
set
to
move
out
as
soon
as
you
give
the
word
he
said
we
all
in
position
on
antigrav
that
smart
work
we
just
finished
our
net
vall
said
going
on
antigrav
now
he
added
as
he
felt
the
dome
lift
i
hope
you
wo
be
too
disappointed
if
you
draw
a
blank
on
your
end
we
realize
that
they
closed
out
the
whole
esaron
sector
skordran
kirv
eight
thousand
odd
miles
away
replied
we
taking
in
a
couple
of
ships
we
going
to
make
a
survey
all
up
the
coast
there
are
a
lot
of
other
sectors
where
slaves
can
be
sold
in
this
area
in
the
outside
viewscreen
tuned
to
a
slowly
rotating
pickup
on
the
top
of
a
tower
spatially
equivalent
with
a
room
in
a
tall
building
on
second
level
triplanetary
empire
sector
he
could
see
his
own
conveyer
rising
vertically
with
the
news
conveyers
following
and
the
troop
conveyers
several
miles
away
coming
into
position
finally
they
were
all
placed
he
reported
the
fact
to
skordran
kirv
and
then
picked
up
a
everybody
ready
for
transposition
he
called
on
my
count
thirty
seconds
twenty
seconds
fifteen
seconds
five
seconds
four
seconds
three
seconds
two
seconds
one
second
all
the
screens
went
gray
the
inside
of
the
dome
passed
into
another
continuum
even
into
another
kind
of
the
transposition
would
take
half
an
hour
that
seemed
to
be
the
time
needed
to
build
up
and
collapse
the
transposition
field
regardless
of
the
paratemporal
distance
covered
the
dome
above
and
around
them
vanished
the
bare
world
of
police
terminal
vanished
too
into
the
uniform
green
of
the
uninhabited
fifth
level
a
planet
could
take
pretty
good
care
of
itself
he
thought
if
people
would
only
leave
it
alone
then
he
began
to
see
the
fields
and
villages
of
fourth
level
cities
appeared
and
vanished
growing
higher
and
vaster
as
they
went
across
the
more
civilized
third
level
one
was
under
air
attack
there
was
almost
never
a
paratemporal
transposition
which
did
not
run
through
some
scene
of
battle
he
unbuckled
his
belt
and
took
off
his
boots
and
tunic
all
around
him
the
others
were
doing
the
same
did
have
to
be
breathed
it
could
enter
the
nervous
system
by
any
orifice
or
lesion
even
a
pore
or
a
scratch
a
spacesuit
was
the
only
protection
one
of
the
detectives
helped
him
on
with
his
metal
and
plastic
armor
before
sealing
his
gauntlets
he
reciprocated
the
assistance
then
checked
the
needler
and
blaster
and
the
long
batonlike
ultrasonic
paralyzer
on
his
belt
and
made
sure
that
the
radio
and
in
his
helmet
were
working
he
hoped
that
the
frantic
efforts
to
gather
several
thousand
spacesuits
onto
police
terminal
from
the
industrial
and
commercial
and
interplanetary
sectors
had
started
rumors
which
had
gotten
to
the
ears
of
some
of
the
organization
ubiquitous
agents
the
country
below
was
already
turning
to
the
parched
browns
and
yellows
of
the
abzar
sector
there
was
not
another
of
the
conveyers
in
sight
but
electronic
and
mechanical
lag
in
the
individual
controls
and
even
the
between
them
and
the
central
radio
control
would
have
prevented
them
from
going
into
transposition
at
the
same
fractional
microsecond
the
began
piling
into
their
cars
then
the
red
light
overhead
winked
to
green
and
the
dome
flickered
and
solidified
into
cold
inert
metal
the
screens
lighted
up
again
and
vall
could
see
skordran
kirv
across
asia
and
the
pacific
getting
into
his
helmet
a
dot
of
light
in
the
center
of
the
underview
screen
widened
as
the

under
the
conveyer
irised

around
the

base
big
rectangles
of
fenced
slave
pens
with
metal
barracks
inside
the
huge
circle
of
the
kholghoor

building
and
a
smaller
structure
that
must
house
conveyers
to
other
abzar
sector
time
lines
the
and
living
quarters
and
hangars
and
warehouses
and
docks
was
wreathed
in
mist
the
ring
of
conveyers
at
three
thousand
feet
were
opening
and
spewing
out
aircars
and
airboats
farther
away
the
greater
ring
of
heavy
conveyers
were
unloading
armored
and
shielded
an
aircar
which
must
have
been
above
the
reach
of
the
gas
was
streaking
away
toward
the
west
with
three
police
cars
after
it
as
he
watched
the
air
around
it
fairly
sizzled
blue
with
the
rays
of
neutron
disruption
blasters
and
then
it
blew
apart
the
three
police
cars
turned
and
came
back
more
slowly
the
passenger
ship
which
had
been
hastily
fitted
with
armament
was
circling
about
the
great
dock
conveyer
which
had
brought
it
was
gone
transposed
back
to
police
terminal
to
pick
up
another
ship
he
recorded
a
message
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
pulled
out
the
tape
and
sealed
it
in
a
capsule
and
put
the
capsule
in
a
mesh
message
ball
attaching
it
to
a
couple
of
wires
and
flipping
a
switch
the
ball
flashed
and
vanished
leaving
the
wires
cleanly
sheared
off
when
it
got
back
to
police
terminal
half
an
hour
later
it
would
rematerialize
eject
a
parachute
and
turn
on
a
whistle
to
call
attention
to
itself
then
he
sealed
on
his
helmet
climbed
into
an
aircar
and
turned
on
his
to
speak
to
the
driver
the
car
lifted
a
few
inches
floated
out
an
open
port
and
dived
downward
illustration
he
landed
at
the
big
building
there
were
spaces
for
fifty
conveyers
around
it
and
all
but
eight
of
them
were
in
place
one
must
have
arrived
since
the
gas
bombs
burst
it
was
crammed
with
senseless
kharanda
slaves
a
couple
of
paratime
police
officers
were
towing
a
tank
of
around
on
an
maintaining
the
proper
concentration
in
case
any
more
came
in
at
the
smaller
conveyer
building
there
were
no
conveyers
only
a
number
of
circles
around
a
central
circle
the
organization
personnel
there
had
been
dragged
outside
and
a
group
of
paracops
were
sealing
it
up
installing
robot
watchmen
and
preparing
to
flood
it
with
gas
at
the
slave
pens
a
string
of
conveyers
having
unloaded
soldiers
and
were
coming
in
to
take
on
unconscious
slaves
for
transposition
to
police
terminal
aircars
and
airboats
were
bringing
in
gassed
slavers
they
were
being
shackled
and
dumped
into
the
slave
barracks
as
soon
as
the
gas
cleared
and
they
could
be
brought
back
to
consciousness
they
would
be
and
questioned
he
had
finished
a
tour
of
the
warehouses
looking
at
the
kegs
of
gunpowder
and
the
casks
of
brandy
the
piles
of
pig
lead
the
stacks
of
cases
containing
muskets
these
must
have
all
come
from
some
handcraft
time
line
then
there
were
swords
and
hatchets
and
knives
that
had
been
made
on
industrial
sector
the
organization
must
be
getting
them
through
some
legitimate
trading
company
and
mirrors
and
perfumes
and
synthetic
fiber
textiles
and
cheap
jewelry
of
similar
provenance
it
looked
as
though
this
stuff
had
been
brought
in
by
ship
from
somewhere
else
on
this
time
line
the
warehouses
were
too
far
from
the
conveyers
and
right
beside
the
ship
dock
there
was
a
tremendous
explosion
somewhere
vall
and
the
men
with
him
ran
outside
looking
about
the
of
their
helmets
giving
them
no
idea
of
the
source
of
the
sound
one
of
the
policemen
pointed
and
vall
eyes
followed
his
arm
the
ship
that
had
been
transposed
in
in
the
big
conveyer
was
falling
blown
in
half
as
he
looked
both
sections
hit
the
ground
several
miles
away
a
strange
ship
a
freighter
was
coming
in
fast
and
as
he
watched
a
blue
spark
winked
from
her
bow
as
a
blaster
was
activated
there
was
another
explosion
overhead
they
all
ran
for
shelter
as
disintegrated
into
falling
at
once
all
the
other
conveyers
which
were
on
antigrav
began
flashing
and
vanishing
that
was
the
right
the
only
thing
to
do
he
knew
but
it
was
leaving
him
and
his
men
isolated
and
under
attack
so
that
was
it
dalgroth
sorn
the
paratime
commissioner
for
security
said
relieved
when
tortha
karf
had
finished
yes
and
i
repeat
it
under
too
tortha
karf
added
oh
do
talk
that
way
karf
dalgroth
sorn
scolded
he
was
at
least
a
century
tortha
karf
senior
he
had
the
face
of
an
elderly
and
lion
you
wanted
to
keep
this
prisoner
under
wraps
till
you
could
him
and
you
wanted
the
organization
to
think
salgath
was
alive
and
talking
i
approve
both
but
he
gestured
to
the
viewscreen
across
the
room
tuned
to
a
pickup
back
of
the
speaker
chair
in
the
council
chamber
tortha
karf
turned
a
knob
to
bring
the
sound
volume
up
well
i
raising
this
point
a
member
from
the
management
seats
in
the
center
was
saying
because
these
earlier
charges
of
illegal
arrest
and
illegal
detention
are
part
and
parcel
with
the
charges
growing
out
of
the
telecast
last
evening
well
that
telecast
was
a
fake
that
been
established
somebody
on
the
left
heckled
councilman
salgath
confession
on
the
evening
of
day
was
a
fake
the
management
supporter
nanthav
skov
retorted
well
then
why
was
it
necessary
to
fake
the
second
one
a
light
began
winking
on
the
big
panel
in
front
of
the
speaker
asthar
varn
i
recognize
councilman
hasthor
flan
asthar
said
i
believe
i
can
construct
a
theory
that
will
explain
that
hasthor
flan
said
i
suggest
that
when
the
paratime
police
were
questioning
councilman
salgath
under
he
made
statements
incriminating
either
the
paratime
police
as
a
whole
or
some
member
of
the
paratime
police
whom
tortha
karf
had
to
protect
say
somebody
like
assistant
verkan
so
they
just
killed
him
and
made
up
this
impostor
tortha
karf
began
alphabetically
to
blaspheme
every
god
he
had
ever
heard
of
he
had
only
gotten
as
far
as
a
fourth
level
deity
named
allah
when
a
red
light
began
flashing
in
front
of
asthar
varn
and
the
voice
of
a
amplified
roared
point
of
special
urgency
point
of
special
urgency
it
has
been
requested
that
the

be

at
once
with

to
an
important

has
just
come

subcontinent
you
can
stop
swearing
now
karf
dalgroth

grinned
i

this
is

kostran

on
the
edge
of
the
couch
with
one

around
zinganna
waist
on
the

side
of

hadron
dalla
lay
at
full
length
her
elbows
propped
and
her
chin
in
her
hands
the
screen
in
front
of
them
showed
a
fading
sunset
although
it
was
only
a
little
past
noon
at
dhergabar
equivalent
a
dark
ship
was
coming
slowly
in
against
the
red
sky
in
the
center
of
a
compound
a
conveyer
hung
on
antigrav
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
and
beyond
a
long
metal
was
spilling
light
from
open
doors
and
windows
that
crowd
that
was
just
taken
in
wo
be
finished
for
a
couple
of
hours
a
voice
was
saying
i
do
know
how
much
they
be
able
to
tell
the
psychists
say
they
all
telling
about
the
same
stories
what
those
stories
are
of
course
i
not
able
to
repeat
after
the
trouble
caused
by
a
certain
news
commentator
who
shall
be
nameless
he
not
connected
with
this
news
service
i
happy
to
say
we
all
leaning
over
backward
to
keep
from
breaking
paratime
police
security
one
thing
shortly
after
the
arrival
of
the
second
ship
from
police
terminal
and
believe
me
that
ship
came
in
just
in
the
nick
of
time
the
dead
abzar
city
which
the
criminals
were
using
as
their
main
base
for
this
time
line
and
from
which
they
launched
the
air
attack
against
us
was
located
and
now
word
has
come
in
that
it
is
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
paratime
police
personally
i
doubt
if
a
great
deal
of
information
has
been
gotten
from
any
prisoners
taken
there
the
lengths
to
which
this
organization
went
to
keep
their
own
people
in
ignorance
is
simply
unbelievable
a
man
appeared
for
a
moment
in
the
lighted
doorway
of
the
shed
then
stepped
outside
look
dalla
cried
there
vall
there
assistant
verkan
now
the
commentator
agreed
assistant
would
you
mind
saying
a
few
words
here
i
know
you
a
busy
man
sir
but
you
are
also
the
public
hero
of
home
time
line

vall
said
this
was
the
first
secret
session
of
executive
council
in
over
two
thousand
years
and
i
thought
i
drop
dead
when
they
passed
that
motion
to
submit
themselves
to
a
few
councilmen
are
going
to
drop
dead
before
they
can
be
dalla
prophesied
over
the
rim
of
her
glass
a
few
have
already
i
have
a
list
of
about
a
dozen
of
them
who
have
had
fatal
accidents
or
committed
suicide
or
just
died
or
vanished
since
the
news
of
your
raid
broke
four
of
them
i
saw
in
the
screen
jump
up
and
run
out
as
soon
as
the
news
came
in
on
day
and
a
lot
of
other
people
our
friend
yandar
yadd
dropped
out
of
sight
for
one
you
heard
what
we
got
out
of
those
servants
of
salgath
trod
i
did
dalla
said
what
both
spies
for
the
organization
they
reported
to
a
woman
named
farilla
who
ran
a
parlor
in
the
prole
district
her
occult
powers
did
warn
her
before
we
sent
a
squad
of
men
for
her
that
was
an
entirely
illegal
arrest
by
the
way
but
it
netted
us
a
list
of
about
three
hundred
prominent
political
business
and
social
persons
whose
servants
have
been
reporting
to
her
she
thought
she
was
working
for
a
telecast
gossipist
that
why
we
have
a
new
butler
darling
vall
interrupted
kandagro
was
reporting
on
us
who
did
she
pass
the
reports
on
to
dalla
asked
tortha
karf
beamed
she
thinks
more
like
a
cop
every
time
i
talk
to
her
he
told
vall
you
better
appoint
her
your
special
assistant
why
about
every
day
some
prole
would
come
in
give
the
recognition
sign
and
get
the
day
accumulation
we
only
got
one
of
them
a
girl
we
having
some
trouble
getting
her
deconditioned
to
a
point
where
she
can
be
hypnotized
into
talking
by
the
time
we
do
they
have
everything
closed
out
i
suppose
the
latest
from
abzar
sector
i
missed
the
last
report
in
the
rush
to
get
to
this
council
session
all
stalled
we
still
boomeranging
the
sector
but
it
about
five
billion
deep
and
the
pattern
for
the
kholghoor
and
esaron
sectors
does
seem
to
apply
i
think
they
have
a
lot
of
these
abzar
time
lines
close
together
and
they
get
from
one
to
another
via
some
terminal
on
fifth
level
tortha
karf
nodded
it
was
impossible
to
make
a
transposition
of
less
than
ten
parayears
a
hundred
thousand
time
lines
it
was
impossible
that
the
field
could
build
and
collapse
that
soon
we
also
think
that
this
abzar
time
line
was
only
used
for
the
trader
operation
nothing
we
found
there
was
more
than
a
couple
of
months
old
nothing
since
the
last
rainy
season
in
india
for
instance
everything
was
cleaned
out
on
skordran
kirv
end
tell
him
to
try
the
mississippi
missouri
and
ohio
valleys
tortha
karf

lot
of
those
slaves

have
been
sold

second
level
khiftan
sector
well

time

resignedly
why

farm

level
sicily
tortha
karf
suggested

the
whole
island

that
time
line
and
you

always
be
reached

a
hurry
if

he
unhooked

and
held
a
lengthy
whispered
conversation
