chapter
i
enter
avelyn
it
the
limit
exploded
laura
an
atrocious
shame
agreed
janet
gives
me
nerve
shock
mourned
ethelberga
gloomily
you
see
continued
laura
popping
the
tray
of
her
box
on
to
the
floor
and
sitting
down
on
her
bed
so
as
the
better
to
address
her
audience
you
see
it
been
plumped
upon
us
without
any
warning
miss
thompson
must
have
arranged
it
long
ago
but
she
never
let
out
so
much
as
a
hint
if
i
known
before
i
came
back
i
have
asked
father
to
give
a
term
notice
and
let
me
leave
at
christmas
crystal
clear
i
would
rather
so
would
this
child
i
guess
we
all
should
i
call
it
so
mean
to
have
sprung
it
on
us
like
this
i
really
have
believed
it
of
miss
thompson
she
gone
down
miles
in
my
estimation
i
can
never
feel
the
same
towards
her
again
those
hawthorners
oh
to
think
of
it
what
the
matter
asked
a
fourth
voice
as
another
girl
still
in
hat
and
coat
and
carrying
her
entered
the
dormitory
irma
is
it
you
old
sport
mean
to
say
you
have
heard
the
news
yet
only
just
this
minute
arrived
and
i
flown
straight
upstairs
i
met
hopscotch
in
the
hall
and
asked
i
still
in
the
cowslip
room
and
she
nodded
so
i
did
wait
for
any
more
has
anything
grizzly
happened
you
all
looking
very
glum
we
may
well
look
glum
said
laura
tragically
something
particularly
grizzly
happened
you
remember
that
day
school
at
the
other
side
of
the
town
the
hawthorns
yes
well
it
been
given
up
irma
flung
her
hat
on
to
her
bed
and
her
coat
after
it
that
does
concern
us
she
remarked
contemptuously
does
it
oh
no
of
course
not
in
the
least
laura
voice
was
sarcastic
it
would
have
been
any
concern
of
ours
only
as
it
happens
they
all
come
on
here
irma
turned
round
the
very
picture
of
dismay
not
surely
great
minerva
you
do
mean
it
hold
me
up
i
feel
rocky
laura
looked
at
her
and
shook
her
head
in
commiseration
yes
that
how
it
took
us
all
when
we
heard
she
remarked
better
sit
down
on
your
bed
till
you
get
the
first
shock
over
enough
to
make
a
camel
weep
i
could
believe
it
myself
for
a
few
minutes
but
it
only
too
true
unfortunately
for
us
the
hawthorns
those
girls
whom
we
never
spoke
to
would
have
touched
with
a
pair
of
tongs
gasped
irma
you
may
well
marvel
sympathized
janet
but
what
miss
thompson
of
why
she
always
looked
down
so
on
the
hawthorns
would
let
us
arrange
matches
with
their
teams
and
kept
us
away
from
them
at
that
bazaar
as
if
they
been
infectious
been
the
tradition
of
the
school
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
traditions
have
flown
to
the
four
winds
there
be
nearly
fifty
hawthorners
turning
up
by
nine
morning
nearly
fifty
and
we
were
only
ourselves
last
term
why
the
school
will
be
swamped
exactly
and
with
day
girls
too
when
there
were
boarders
to
twelve
day
girls
we
could
have
things
pretty
well
as
we
liked
but
if
we
to
hold
our
own
against
sixty
or
so
well
it
mean
war
finished
ethelberga
setting
her
mouth
grimly
but
what
possessed
miss
thompson
to
do
such
an
atrocious
thing
cried
irma
in
exasperation
my
child
i
suppose
miss
perry
was
giving
up
the
school
and
tommiekins
bought
the
connection
she
completely
veered
round
in
her
opinions
she
told
adah
gartley
they
were
nice
girls
and
would
soon
improve
immensely
at
silverside
hope
you
all
make
them
welcome
she
said
to
adah
welcome
echoed
irma
janet
and
ethelberga
eloquently
it
would
have
been
so
bad
continued
laura
if
just
a
few
of
them
say
a
dozen
had
been
coming
we
could
have
kept
ourselves
to
ourselves
and
quite
ignored
them
but
we
being
absolutely
cuckooed
out
do
you
know
that
our
recreation
room
has
been
commandeered
for
an
extra
howls
of
dismay
issued
from
the
trio
now
seated
on
irma
bed
yes
you
hardly
believe
it
but
it
is
a
fact
ran
on
laura
with
dismal
volubility
when
i
went
to
take
my
painting
things
there
i
found
our
tables
and
easy
chairs
gone
and
the
whole
place
filled
up
with
new
desks
and
a
blackboard
where
are
we
going
to
sit
in
the
evenings
demanded
ethelberga
fiercely
goodness
only
knows
in
the
i
suppose
we
evidently
do
count
for
anything
with
tommiekins
now
said
janet
bitterly
the
daisy
dormitory
has
been
taken
for
a
and
an
extra
bed
has
been
put
in
each
of
the
other
dormitories
to
make
up
did
you
notice
irma
that
there
are
five
here
now
instead
of
only
four
why
so
there
are
what
a
hateful
cram
who
to
have
the
fifth
i
asked
hopscotch
and
she
said
new
girl
i
could
help
flying
out
at
that
and
she
simply
sat
flat
upon
me
and
withered
me
told
me
to
go
away
and
mind
my
own
business
and
she
was
coming
round
to
inspect
the
cowslip
room
in
half
an
hour
and
i
better
get
on
with
my
unpacking
oh
she
will
why
did
you
tell
us
that
before
exclaimed
the
others
bouncing
up
with
considerable
haste
and
setting
to
work
again
to
empty
their
boxes
i
forgot
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
those
wretched
hawthorners
made
me
feel
weak
you
feel
weaker
still
if
hopscotch
comes
in
and
finds
you
with
nothing
unpacked
observed
laura
sagely
stowing
underclothes
in
her
middle
drawer
with
the
utmost
rapidity
i
advise
you
to
make
some
sort
of
a
beginning
even
if
you
do
put
things
away
tidily
fling
them
in
anyhow
stick
a
blouse
for
a
top
layer
and
straighten
them
up
afterwards
do
let
her
see
them
still
inside
your
box
for
a
few
minutes
the
girls
suspended
talk
for
work
laura
flaxen
head
vibrated
between
box
and
wardrobe
janet
arranged
her
and
replaited
her
dark
pigtail
ethelberga
hung
up
a
selection
of
photographs
and
placed
her
nightdress
inside
its
case
irma
spread
her
bed
with
her
possessions
preparatory
to
filling
her
drawers
and
comforted
her
ruffled
feelings
with
the
last
in
the
paper
bag
she
had
brought
with
her
the
dormitory
was
of
fair
size
and
though
the
girls
might
grumble
contained
ample
space
for
the
fifth
bed
it
was
a
pretty
room
with
a
yellow
and
chintz
curtains
with
little
bunches
of
cowslips
on
them
there
were
pictures
of
cowslips
also
on
the
walls
and
all
the
and
had
yellow
ribbons
the
window
looked
over
the
garden
and
behind
the
belt
of
trees
that
bordered
the
lawn
gleamed
the
grey
waters
of
the
estuary
where
ships
were
stealing
out
from
port
into
the
dangers
of
the
great
waters
the
girls
prided
themselves
upon
this
view
though
at
the
present
moment
they
were
too
busy
to
think
of
it
three
years
previous
experience
had
taught
them
that
when
miss
hopkins
made
a
tour
of
inspection
on
the
first
afternoon
of
term
she
meant
business
and
woe
betide
the
luckless
slacker
who
had
gossiped
and
dawdled
instead
of
bestowing
her
property
in
her
own
lawful
drawers
if
she
had
announced
her
intention
of
visiting
them
shortly
she
might
certainly
be
trusted
to
keep
her
word
their
expectations
were
not
mistaken
for
before
the
had
expired
the
door
opened
revealing
the
short
stout
figure
and
rather
angular
features
of
the
second
mistress
the
girls
jumped
up
and
stood
obediently
at
attention
ready
to
go
through
the
usual
routine
of
dormitory
superintendence
miss
hopkins
however
was
not
alone
in
her
wake
followed
a
girl
of
fifteen
whom
she
bustled
in
in
a
hurry
this
is
your
dormitory
avelyn
the
cowslip
room
we
call
it
your
bed
and
these
are
your
dress
hooks
and
your
drawers
the
bringing
your
box
upstairs
oh
he
here
now
put
it
at
the
end
of
the
bed
tom
please
i
suppose
you
have
the
key
avelyn
then
you
better
unlock
it
at
once
these
are
your
laura
talbot
irma
ridley
janet
duncan
and
ethelberga
carnforth
girls
this
is
avelyn
watson
i
hope
you
will
make
her
welcome
begin
your
unpacking
now
avelyn
i
shall
be
back
directly
to
see
how
you
are
getting
on
miss
hopkins
whose
duties
on
the
first
day
of
term
were
multifarious
withdrew
as
hurriedly
as
she
had
entered
her
visits
generally
resembled
the
brief
career
of
a
whirlwind
sometimes
her
pupils
considered
that
they
carried
equal
desolation
the
new
girl
remained
standing
by
the
bed
and
for
the
moment
made
no
effort
to
obey
orders
and
unlock
her
box
she
was
pretty
her
four
critics
decided
that
point
at
their
first
glance
her
chin
was
softly
rounded
and
her
nose
was
small
and
straight
her
general
colouring
was
brunette
but
the
big
eyes
were
grey
as
the
estuary
outside
she
flushed
vivid
pink
under
the
scrutiny
of
her
for
a
brief
instant
they
thought
she
was
going
to
cry
then
she
winked
rapidly
and
began
to
whistle
instead
i
should
advise
you
to
whistle
too
loud
counselled
janet
by
way
of
breaking
the
ice
miss
hopkins
is
only
in
the
next
dormitory
and
she
got
a
crusade
on
against
whistling
at
least
she
had
last
term
and
i
do
suppose
changed
her
tactics
she
does
generally
do
the
eternal
snows
change
murmured
ethelberga
the
new
girl
stopped
with
her
mouth
puckered
into
a
button
a
look
of
consternation
spread
over
her
face
then
passed
into
a
smile
i
was
told
i
have
to
be
jolly
careful
and
mind
my
p
and
q
here
she
remarked
cheerily
i
been
just
five
minutes
in
the
school
and
my
first
impressions
are
that
miss
thompson
aims
at
unadulterated
dignity
and
that
miss
hopkins
is
concentrated
essence
of
fuss
am
i
near
not
so
far
off
laughed
laura
they
can
exchange
characters
sometimes
though
i
seen
miss
hopkins
ride
her
high
horse
and
be
dignity
personified
and
on
the
other
hand
i
seen
miss
thompson
more
ruffled
than
a
head
mistress
has
any
business
to
be
you
soon
get
to
know
them
i
suppose
i
shall
whether
i
shall
altogether
like
them
is
another
question
you
like
silverside
gushed
irma
it
a
perfectly
delightful
school
at
least
it
used
to
be
we
afraid
it
is
going
to
be
utterly
and
entirely
spoilt
now
why
because
it
being
invaded
it
used
to
be
quite
small
and
select
more
boarders
than
day
girls
you
know
and
now
we
just
had
a
horrible
shock
the
whole
of
another
day
school
is
being
plumped
upon
us
a
school
we
always
despised
we
too
indignant
for
words
avelyn
who
was
fumbling
with
the
lock
of
her
box
lifted
her
head
do
you
like
them
coming
like
them
sophonisba
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
we
always
looked
down
on
them
so
fearfully
why
if
we
met
any
of
them
in
the
street
we
used
just
to
stare
straight
through
them
as
if
they
exist
they
wore
coats
and
horrid
stiff
sailor
hats
with
coloured
bands
for
all
the
world
like
an
institution
i
tell
you
we
simply
would
have
touched
them
you
have
to
know
them
now
to
a
certain
extent
worse
luck
but
they
need
think
we
be
friendly
with
them
for
we
sha
we
shall
keep
a
strict
line
drawn
avelyn
had
lifted
the
tray
of
her
box
on
to
the
floor
and
was
busy
taking
books
from
the
bottom
portion
she
was
too
intent
on
her
occupation
to
reply
irma
whose
writing
pad
and
fountain
pen
had
just
come
to
hand
was
hastily
scribbling
a
letter
home
ethelberga
leaning
out
of
the
window
exchanged
greetings
with
a
schoolmate
in
the
garden
below
janet
vision
was
focused
on
her
drawers
and
laura
had
just
come
across
the
postcard
album
which
she
was
afraid
she
had
forgotten
to
pack
and
was
rejoicing
in
its
possession
for
five
minutes
or
so
the
girls
were
engrossed
with
their
own
affairs
then
the
attention
of
the
room
was
concentrated
again
on
avelyn
you
have
told
us
yet
where
you
live
said
laura
looking
up
suddenly
from
the
contemplation
of
post
cards
my
home
is
at
lyngates
just
now
where
lyngates
about
twenty
miles
from
here
you
say
now
have
you
lived
there
long
only
since
last
spring
you
brought
very
few
clothes
and
things
with
you
commented
irma
who
had
been
watching
the
unpacking
of
the
new
girl
box
with
critical
eyes
you
never
get
through
a
term
on
those
i
should
say
there
is
any
need
to
bring
so
many
things
when
i
going
home
for
the
for
the
heavens
you
do
mean
to
say
you
a
weekly
boarder
why
not
an
expression
of
deep
consternation
spread
over
the
faces
of
four
their
disapproval
was
evident
and
they
voiced
their
objections
we
never
had
such
a
thing
as
a
weekly
boarder
before
you
be
away
all
saturdays
and
sundays
you
be
out
of
all
the
fun
almost
as
bad
as
being
a
day
girl
miss
thompson
said
once
that
she
did
approve
of
weekly
boarders
i
ca
understand
tommiekins
she
changed
so
lately
have
you
ever
been
to
school
before
why
yes
replied
avelyn
smoothing
out
the
folds
of
her
evening
dress
and
hanging
it
on
the
hooks
behind
the
curtain
though
not
since
last
christmas
to
boarding
school
no
it
was
a
day
school
where
i
went
to
the
hawthorns
in
harlingden
if
a
bomb
had
fallen
in
the
dormitory
it
could
not
have
caused
a
greater
upheaval
for
a
moment
the
girls
stared
at
avelyn
as
if
scarcely
crediting
her
statement
do
you
mean
to
say
you
one
of
those
wretched
hawthorners
exploded
janet
at
last
i
used
to
be
but
i
suppose
i
a
silversider
now
and
we
got
you
in
our
dormitory
gasped
laura
so
it
seems
miss
thompson
ought
to
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
herself
fluttered
ethelberga
you
be
rid
of
me
on
saturday
and
sunday
remember
returned
avelyn
bitterly
at
this
crisis
the
clamour
of
the
gong
for
tea
fortunately
put
an
end
to
an
extremely
embarrassing
situation
the
four
fled
leaving
their
new
companion
to
follow
them
to
the
as
best
she
could
when
she
entered
they
were
already
seated
at
table
and
did
not
look
in
her
direction
she
took
a
seat
next
to
a
complete
stranger
who
indeed
handed
her
the
bread
and
butter
but
vouchsafed
no
single
word
of
conversation
when
the
meal
was
over
the
original
inmates
of
the
cowslip
room
retired
to
a
secluded
portion
of
the
garden
and
held
an
indignation
meeting
for
the
first
frenzied
five
minutes
they
allowed
their
wrath
full
swing
and
vibrated
between
a
dormitory
strike
and
writing
to
their
parents
to
beg
for
instant
removal
from
the
school
then
reason
reasserted
itself
and
decided
the
impracticability
of
both
methods
previous
experience
had
shown
them
that
their
head
mistress
was
a
tough
dragon
to
tackle
and
scarcely
likely
to
be
coerced
by
even
the
best
organized
dormitory
strike
while
in
her
heart
of
hearts
each
knew
that
after
paying
her
term
fees
in
advance
her
father
would
need
some
very
solid
cause
of
complaint
to
justify
so
extreme
a
measure
as
a
return
to
the
bosom
of
the
family
they
began
to
discuss
the
matter
more
sanely
the
fact
is
she
here
and
i
suppose
we
ca
get
rid
of
her
admitted
irma
after
all
she
a
boarder
ventured
ethelberga
only
a
weekly
one
qualified
janet
and
a
hawthorner
added
laura
she
said
she
had
been
to
school
since
last
christmas
commented
ethelberga
why
so
she
did
then
she
had
a
sort
of
a
break
from
the
hawthorns
and
in
a
way
she
making
a
fresh
start
here
i
suppose
so
if
she
be
loyal
to
silverside
though
we
could
never
like
her
we
might
bring
ourselves
to
tolerate
her
a
boarder
a
boarder
when
the
girls
returned
to
the
cowslip
room
they
found
their
new
companion
with
emptied
box
putting
the
last
of
her
possessions
into
her
drawers
look
here
avelyn
watson
said
laura
we
been
talking
you
over
although
you
go
home
for
the
week
end
you
still
a
boarder
and
at
silverside
boarders
are
a
very
different
thing
from
day
girls
as
soon
find
out
if
you
had
two
whole
terms
away
from
those
hawthorners
just
forget
them
and
consider
yourself
entirely
one
of
us
if
you
do
that
we
count
you
on
our
side
but
if
you
anything
to
do
with
day
girls
we
cut
you
dead
i
do
quite
understand
returned
avelyn
you
soon
will
said
janet
significantly
i
advise
you
to
think
it
over
added
laura
chapter
ii
an
invasion
the
changes
which
were
taking
place
this
term
at
silverside
certainly
marked
a
new
era
in
its
traditions
up
till
now
it
had
been
essentially
a
boarding
school
there
had
indeed
been
day
girls
who
had
shared
the
classes
and
some
of
the
games
but
they
were
in
the
minority
both
in
numbers
and
in
influence
they
had
had
no
part
in
the
various
guilds
and
societies
and
had
been
made
by
the
boarders
to
feel
that
they
were
inferior
beings
who
did
not
count
the
mistresses
themselves
resident
had
been
accustomed
to
view
the
boarders
as
the
more
important
factors
and
arranged
everything
to
suit
their
convenience
it
had
been
the
unwritten
code
of
the
school
that
to
be
a
boarder
meant
to
procure
preferential
treatment
miss
thompson
however
was
a
woman
who
marched
with
the
times
when
the
opportunity
arose
of
acquiring
the
connection
of
the
hawthorns
the
large
day
school
at
the
other
side
of
the
town
she
closed
with
the
bargain
and
decided
upon
an
entire
change
of
tactics
henceforward
silverside
was
to
be
run
as
girls
day
school
of
harlingden
the
house
was
large
its
accommodation
had
hitherto
exceeded
the
needs
of
the
pupils
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
added
numbers
and
even
in
it
would
be
possible
to
run
up
a
corrugated
iron
or
portable
wooden
building
to
serve
as
lecture
hall
and
gymnasium
the
big
garden
already
contained
several
tennis
courts
and
there
was
a
field
close
at
hand
which
might
be
rented
for
hockey
altogether
miss
thompson
congratulated
herself
that
she
had
performed
a
most
excellent
stroke
of
business
and
she
looked
forward
to
establishing
a
very
flourishing
educational
centre
and
to
laying
by
a
comfortable
provision
upon
which
she
might
retire
when
the
burden
of
teaching
grew
too
heavy
for
her
to
bear
certainly
silverside
was
most
excellently
situated
for
the
purpose
she
had
in
view
the
property
had
been
bought
some
years
before
the
town
of
harlingden
had
expanded
and
while
land
was
still
cheap
the
house
stood
in
its
own
beautiful
grounds
on
the
top
of
a
hill
commanding
a
fine
view
over
the
estuary
it
was
breezy
and
healthy
with
large
lofty
rooms
big
windows
and
ample
accommodation
in
the
way
of
side
doors
and
bathrooms
just
sufficiently
in
the
country
to
allow
of
walks
through
fields
and
woods
yet
near
enough
to
the
town
to
permit
most
girls
to
return
home
for
their
dinners
as
a
day
school
it
was
far
more
conveniently
situated
than
the
hawthorns
harlingden
formerly
a
and
not
particularly
important
town
had
since
the
outbreak
of
the
war
been
turned
into
a
great
munition
centre
the
government
attracted
by
the
advantages
of
the
estuary
had
established
large
permanent
works
there
together
with
a
shipbuilding
industry
in
a
few
short
years
the
population
had
doubled
fresh
suburbs
sprang
up
like
mushrooms
in
the
silverside
district
this
was
particularly
noticeable
for
where
formerly
there
had
been
quite
a
rural
walk
between
hedges
leading
to
the
town
there
now
stood
rows
of
neat
villas
with
stuccoed
fronts
and
balconies
and
conspicuously
new
gardens
the
boarders
at
silverside
who
preferred
country
to
town
greatly
deplored
this
suburban
growth
they
had
always
begged
to
take
their
walks
in
an
opposite
direction
and
had
ignored
harlingden
and
its
industries
as
persistently
as
possible
the
advent
of
about
fifty
day
girls
into
silverside
they
regarded
as
neither
more
nor
less
than
an
alien
invasion
they
sat
together
in
a
tight
clump
when
school
opened
at
nine
on
wednesday
morning
until
the
new
gymnasium
could
be
erected
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
room
large
enough
to
accommodate
everybody
the
old
had
been
emptied
of
furniture
and
fitted
with
forms
and
here
by
sitting
very
close
the
girls
managed
to
cram
themselves
in
for
the
opening
ceremony
miss
thompson
elated
at
heart
but
more
stately
and
dignified
than
ever
in
manner
addressed
her
pupils
in
a
short
speech
as
silverside
is
entering
on
a
new
chapter
of
its
career
she
began
i
should
like
to
put
before
you
all
as
briefly
as
possible
what
i
consider
to
be
the
ideals
of
the
school
those
who
have
been
here
some
years
already
know
our
traditions
but
it
will
do
them
no
harm
to
hear
them
again
and
those
of
you
who
are
new
will
i
hope
understand
and
be
prepared
to
accept
them
with
equal
readiness
first
of
all
we
stand
for
work
we
are
living
in
very
strenuous
times
and
it
is
the
duty
of
all
who
love
their
country
to
do
their
best
every
faithful
struggle
with
your
lessons
here
makes
you
more
fit
to
help
your
country
by
and
by
if
you
have
no
ambition
for
yourselves
remember
that
you
are
part
of
a
great
nation
and
as
such
you
must
not
slack
but
do
your
bit
to
raise
the
general
standard
of
education
you
find
a
joy
and
a
satisfaction
in
mastering
rules
of
arithmetic
or
irregular
verbs
when
you
feel
that
you
are
doing
it
not
only
for
yourselves
but
for
the
general
good
then
there
are
certain
other
things
for
which
silverside
has
always
stood
truth
and
straightforward
dealings
and
a
spirit
of
unity
and
of
loyalty
to
the
school
we
have
striven
to
establish
a
high
tone
here
and
at
all
costs
let
us
preserve
it
this
term
there
is
a
very
large
proportion
of
new
girls
and
hence
a
big
opportunity
for
everybody
there
will
be
inevitable
changes
and
much
pioneer
work
to
be
done
and
each
girl
may
find
a
chance
of
taking
a
share
in
consolidating
our
traditions
i
trust
that
old
and
new
will
join
hands
and
do
their
utmost
to
work
together
harmoniously
for
the
good
of
the
school
and
the
influence
which
through
you
it
may
exercise
on
the
community
later
on
at
the
end
of
miss
thompson
speech
the
girls
separated
and
went
to
their
at
the
eleven
break
they
poured
into
the
garden
they
stood
about
in
little
groups
eating
packets
of
lunch
and
talking
adah
gartley
isobel
norris
and
joyce
edwards
the
three
eldest
boarders
kept
together
to
them
presently
advanced
two
of
the
invaders
a
girl
of
perhaps
seventeen
and
a
stout
girl
a
trifle
younger
our
names
are
annie
broadside
and
gladys
wilks
began
if
we
stayed
on
at
the
hawthorns
one
or
other
of
us
would
have
been
head
this
term
you
look
about
the
oldest
of
the
old
lot
here
so
perhaps
you
tell
us
how
this
school
managed
do
you
have
monitresses
or
prefects
or
what
miss
thompson
mention
a
word
about
that
in
her
speech
we
like
to
know
adah
glanced
at
her
rather
superciliously
we
never
had
anything
of
the
sort
here
she
replied
annie
broadside
eyes
grew
round
with
amazement
what
no
prefects
or
monitresses
how
in
the
world
did
you
manage
then
we
did
find
them
necessary
maintained
adah
stiffly
gladys
wilks
whistled
and
looked
eloquently
at
her
friend
of
course
it
was
a
very
small
school
she
remarked
so
i
dare
say
you
somehow
muddled
on
but
surely
there
have
to
be
something
of
the
sort
instituted
those
juniors
will
give
trouble
if
there
no
one
to
tackle
them
added
annie
just
look
at
them
over
there
the
juveniles
in
question
were
certainly
behaving
with
a
lack
of
decorum
entirely
foreign
to
the
former
atmosphere
of
silverside
they
were
in
fact
engaged
in
jumping
over
miss
thompson
most
cherished
flower
beds
with
disastrous
consequences
to
the
pet
geraniums
and
calceolarias
the
little
hooligans
exclaimed
adah
rushing
to
the
rescue
of
the
unfortunate
flowers
here
get
away
you
kiddies
this
sort
of
performance
is
allowed
stop
this
minute
the
five
children
who
were
making
a
display
of
their
jumping
agility
called
a
temporary
halt
and
stared
aggressively
at
adah
who
says
it
not
allowed
enquired
a
pert
who
was
evidently
the
ringleader
do
are
you
a
teacher
no
a
prefect
or
a
monitress
no
then
what
are
you
i
a
boarder
announced
adah
with
dignity
the
junior
sniggered
rudely
boarders
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
us
that
i
can
see
we
do
as
we
like
come
along
girls
follow
the
leader
and
turning
she
made
a
long
leap
across
the
bed
landing
in
the
edging
of
blue
lobelias
adah
stood
by
raging
and
impotent
she
would
have
interfered
by
force
but
very
fortunately
at
that
moment
the
school
bell
rang
and
the
irrepressible
juniors
desisted
from
their
occupation
and
raced
one
another
to
the
side
door
adah
followed
thoughtfully
her
brain
was
a
whirlpool
of
new
impressions
most
of
them
not
at
all
favourable
and
she
had
not
yet
had
time
to
assort
them
and
put
them
into
mental
one
idea
loomed
large
silverside
was
going
to
be
an
utterly
different
place
from
what
it
had
been
before
that
brief
tussle
had
revealed
much
hitherto
the
little
girls
had
been
children
rather
in
awe
of
their
elders
and
easily
held
in
check
these
new
juniors
seemed
a
different
generation
and
a
very
perverse
and
untoward
one
everything
indeed
was
changed
her
form
room
overflowed
with
strangers
and
there
was
a
new
mistress
whose
methods
were
different
from
those
of
miss
hopkins
adah
mindful
of
her
position
as
oldest
pupil
did
the
honours
of
the
school
showing
teacher
and
girls
where
books
exercise
paper
and
other
necessaries
were
kept
but
she
performed
this
charity
more
in
the
spirit
of
than
with
any
goodwill
when
the
last
of
the
day
girls
had
taken
her
departure
after
four
adah
heaved
an
immense
sigh
of
relief
and
sent
a
scout
round
to
call
a
boarders
meeting
for
prompt
immediately
after
tea
therefore
all
the
resident
pupils
of
silverside
assembled
in
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
they
had
chosen
that
spot
because
it
was
secluded
and
they
were
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
their
consultations
were
to
be
of
a
private
nature
and
they
did
not
wish
any
mistress
to
overhear
them
the
was
not
very
large
much
too
small
in
fact
to
contain
girls
but
some
squatted
on
the
steps
and
some
on
the
and
some
overflowed
on
to
the
lawn
adah
seated
on
the
little
rustic
table
looked
round
to
see
that
her
full
audience
was
assembled
and
opened
the
proceedings
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
indignation
it
seems
to
me
and
i
expect
to
most
of
you
that
matters
here
have
just
about
come
to
a
crisis
the
school
turned
it
been
invaded
by
this
horde
of
day
girls
and
everything
is
altogether
different
now
silverside
has
always
existed
for
the
boarders
miss
thompson
has
recognized
that
and
we
had
a
great
many
special
privileges
it
who
have
set
the
tone
of
the
school
and
made
silverside
what
it
is
as
long
as
we
outnumbered
the
day
girls
that
was
pretty
easy
but
now
that
this
huge
flock
has
trooped
in
it
may
be
a
difficult
matter
to
cope
with
them
we
must
make
up
our
minds
what
we
intend
to
do
has
anybody
any
suggestion
to
offer
i
thought
of
writing
to
my
father
and
asking
him
to
take
me
away
at
christmas
propounded
irma
flushing
with
nervousness
at
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
adah
gazed
at
her
with
an
expression
of
mingled
amazement
and
sorrow
irma
ridley
i
should
have
expected
this
from
leave
the
school
indeed
where
your
loyalty
i
hope
you
have
been
spreading
such
an
abominable
notion
no
indeed
we
silversiders
must
desert
the
old
ship
we
got
to
stick
to
her
and
steer
her
course
for
her
through
very
troubled
waters
do
let
anyone
suggest
ratting
again
irma
covered
with
confusion
blushed
yet
more
furiously
the
sentiment
of
the
meeting
was
against
her
and
she
felt
that
she
had
blundered
badly
she
murmured
an
incoherent
apology
and
began
nervously
tying
knots
in
her
surely
someone
has
a
better
suggestion
to
offer
than
this
said
adah
her
clear
blue
eyes
searching
the
faces
of
her
companions
please
be
afraid
of
airing
your
opinions
silverside
must
stick
to
its
traditions
ventured
joyce
edwards
we
must
let
everything
be
swamped
by
the
invasion
let
make
a
boarders
league
proposed
isobel
norris
and
pledge
ourselves
to
hold
together
and
support
one
another
a
kind
of
blood
brotherhood
you
know
the
very
thing
agreed
everybody
the
idea
was
so
manifestly
satisfactory
that
each
girl
wondered
why
it
had
not
occurred
to
herself
to
suggest
it
to
bind
themselves
in
so
close
a
bond
of
union
seemed
picturesque
and
romantic
in
the
extreme
it
appealed
to
their
imaginations
tremendously
we
shall
be
fighting
for
the
school
colours
said
adah
with
a
light
of
enthusiasm
shining
in
her
blue
eyes
it
the
little
band
of
old
pupils
who
are
to
preserve
the
ideals
of
the
school
these
new
girls
must
be
made
to
realize
that
they
at
silverside
now
and
not
at
the
hawthorns
i
guess
we
rub
it
into
them
murmured
laura
talbot
to
the
irma
it
was
a
new
girl
after
all
however
who
made
the
really
practical
suggestion
of
the
meeting
avelyn
watson
had
sat
very
quietly
during
the
proceedings
feeling
herself
in
a
somewhat
awkward
position
she
had
been
a
pupil
at
the
hawthorns
for
two
years
but
her
mother
had
never
really
liked
the
school
and
had
removed
her
from
it
the
preceding
christmas
avelyn
had
come
to
silverside
quite
ready
to
embrace
its
traditions
and
to
erase
the
hawthorns
from
her
memory
to
be
confronted
with
more
than
fifty
of
her
old
schoolfellows
some
of
whom
had
claimed
affectionate
intimacy
with
her
had
been
somewhat
of
a
shock
she
did
not
quite
know
where
she
stood
she
was
not
sure
whether
the
boarders
were
disposed
to
receive
her
into
the
bosom
of
the
league
or
if
they
would
regard
her
as
among
the
aliens
one
fact
culled
from
former
experience
rose
to
her
lips
she
was
too
shy
to
state
it
publicly
but
she
bent
towards
laura
talbot
and
whispered
tell
them
if
they
want
to
do
anything
they
ought
to
have
prefects
you
see
i
laura
immediately
broached
the
suggestion
as
her
own
and
gained
the
whole
credit
for
it
the
idea
hinted
at
by
annie
broadside
and
gladys
wilks
in
the
morning
had
been
fermenting
in
adah
brain
all
day
and
she
grasped
at
it
eagerly
it
would
give
us
just
the
authority
we
want
she
agreed
we
better
make
a
deputation
and
speak
to
miss
thompson
about
it
who
go
with
me
the
principal
busy
and
burdened
with
a
hundred
new
cares
sat
in
her
study
that
evening
answering
letters
from
parents
she
pushed
away
her
papers
rather
wearily
as
the
deputation
consisting
of
adah
gartley
isobel
norris
consie
arkwright
and
joyce
edwards
entered
the
room
with
a
kind
of
bashful
assurance
she
was
tired
but
she
was
always
ready
to
listen
to
what
her
girls
had
to
say
it
had
been
her
invariable
rule
to
meet
them
she
heard
them
now
patiently
asking
many
questions
for
they
were
shy
in
stating
their
case
and
did
not
at
first
explain
their
objects
lucidly
when
at
length
she
had
got
at
the
gist
of
the
matter
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
thought
for
a
moment
or
two
before
she
replied
what
you
say
is
very
true
the
influx
of
another
school
into
silverside
may
certainly
endanger
our
old
traditions
i
look
to
you
boarders
who
have
been
with
me
for
years
to
uphold
every
principle
for
which
we
have
hitherto
stood
i
agree
that
you
might
find
your
task
very
difficult
unless
you
were
armed
with
some
authority
we
have
never
had
school
officers
before
but
that
was
because
we
did
not
feel
them
a
necessity
i
will
try
the
experiment
and
see
how
it
answers
you
four
are
among
my
oldest
pupils
you
know
what
silverside
has
stood
for
in
the
past
and
you
shall
help
to
mould
its
future
i
appoint
you
prefects
and
give
you
power
to
report
to
me
or
to
any
other
mistress
breaches
of
discipline
which
come
under
your
notice
and
in
certain
cases
to
take
off
order
marks
adah
who
is
the
eldest
and
was
first
in
last
term
examination
list
shall
be
head
girl
i
will
announce
this
at
nine
my
great
object
is
to
amalgamate
the
two
schools
into
one
as
quickly
as
possible
and
i
trust
that
you
will
not
show
any
favouritism
towards
old
girls
but
will
give
the
new
ones
equal
justice
we
do
our
best
miss
thompson
declared
adah
isobel
consie
and
joyce
in
an
obedient
chorus
and
doubtless
they
really
meant
to
do
their
best
but
schoolgirls
are
prejudiced
beings
and
apt
to
be
conservative
to
the
core
they
had
decided
beforehand
that
the
former
pupils
of
silverside
and
the
boarders
in
particular
had
the
sole
prerogative
of
high
ideals
culture
and
gentility
and
that
such
refinements
could
not
and
did
not
exist
among
those
who
had
come
from
the
hawthorns
in
their
minds
the
division
was
as
complete
as
that
between
the
sheep
and
the
goats
they
looked
upon
the
hawthorners
as
heathen
and
upon
themselves
in
the
light
of
missionaries
they
set
to
work
very
patronizingly
to
make
their
influence
felt
now
there
is
nothing
which
most
people
resent
so
much
as
patronage
the
hawthorners
had
been
happy
enough
in
their
old
school
and
they
were
keenly
insulted
at
being
given
to
understand
that
they
were
regarded
by
the
silversiders
as
inferiors
they
held
indignation
meetings
of
their
own
on
the
subject
why
should
those
things
lord
it
over
us
exploded
annie
broadside
they
not
as
clever
as
we
are
we
beat
them
easily
in
class
added
gladys
wilks
i
should
just
think
we
do
they
simply
not
in
the
running
at
declared
gertrude
howells
and
yet
they
prefects
if
you
please
at
the
hawthorns
prefects
were
always
chosen
from
those
who
got
the
highest
marks
in
the
examinations
you
were
top
last
term
annie
and
would
have
been
head
girl
if
the
school
had
gone
on
you
were
only
two
marks
behind
me
gladys
and
you
know
miss
perry
had
counted
the
botany
papers
it
was
really
a
between
us
well
we
both
out
of
it
now
very
much
so
i
do
call
it
fair
that
these
four
boarders
should
have
all
the
authority
it
is
if
they
think
we
going
to
knuckle
under
to
them
they
very
much
mistaken
giving
themselves
such
airs
about
being
old
silversiders
and
treating
us
like
inferiors
ca
we
do
anything
let
form
an
hawthorners
guild
and
vow
to
stick
to
one
another
there
are
more
of
us
than
of
them
and
we
beat
them
in
lessons
and
at
games
and
let
them
see
who
inferior
right
you
are
you
shall
be
captain
annie
then
you
shall
be
secretary
gladys
i
know
everybody
will
be
only
too
delighted
to
join
they
will
but
do
let
those
silversiders
know
one
single
word
about
it
they
sha
indeed
we
here
and
the
school
is
as
much
ours
as
theirs
our
old
set
will
follow
us
and
not
care
a
toss
about
the
prefects
adah
and
her
had
indeed
made
a
terrible
mistake
by
their
superior
and
patronizing
ways
instead
of
welding
the
school
into
one
as
miss
thompson
had
hoped
and
intended
they
had
entirely
alienated
the
new
element
and
had
set
up
a
most
unhappy
barrier
of
division
silverside
resolved
itself
into
two
parties
each
apparently
determined
to
misunderstand
the
other
and
obstinately
resolute
not
to
mix
miss
thompson
anxiously
watching
the
result
of
her
experiment
saw
only
the
surface
of
things
for
most
of
the
trouble
lay
below
deeper
than
the
ken
of
head
mistresses
the
teachers
were
aware
of
an
undercurrent
of
discontent
but
could
not
absolutely
discover
the
reason
only
the
girls
themselves
knew
that
the
school
was
split
into
rival
factions
between
whom
there
was
going
to
be
war
chapter
iii
walden
as
avelyn
watson
is
one
of
the
central
figures
of
this
story
it
will
be
well
to
go
back
some
months
and
follow
the
events
which
preceded
her
appearance
at
silverside
though
apparently
trivial
enough
they
are
important
because
if
they
had
not
happened
she
would
have
come
to
school
as
a
day
girl
instead
of
a
boarder
and
the
part
which
fate
put
into
her
hands
to
play
could
never
have
been
acted
it
all
began
with
daphne
forgetting
to
change
her
wet
stockings
daphne
had
done
many
imprudent
things
before
and
had
suffered
more
or
less
from
them
this
time
dame
nature
tired
of
having
her
laws
flouted
determined
to
teach
her
a
lesson
the
specialist
who
was
called
in
to
consult
with
the
family
doctor
made
an
exhaustive
examination
of
the
case
then
pronounced
his
verdict
she
must
live
in
the
town
if
you
want
her
to
grow
up
into
healthy
womanhood
a
year
or
two
in
the
country
is
an
imperative
necessity
up
to
the
time
when
sir
basil
hunter
delivered
this
ultimatum
the
watsons
had
always
lived
in
harlingden
daphne
and
avelyn
could
remember
the
old
days
when
daddy
had
been
alive
and
mother
hair
had
been
brown
and
not
grey
and
she
had
laughed
as
gaily
and
easily
as
they
did
now
that
was
many
years
ago
and
to
david
and
anthony
at
any
rate
their
father
was
little
more
than
an
enlarged
photograph
on
the
wall
they
had
all
been
born
in
the
comfortable
commonplace
house
in
gerrard
square
and
had
taken
it
and
its
uninteresting
view
and
its
smoky
little
garden
together
with
the
round
of
town
life
entirely
for
granted
then
the
change
came
watson
thoroughly
alarmed
at
the
doctor
diagnosis
and
nervous
over
the
health
of
her
whole
family
took
immediate
steps
to
carry
out
his
advice
she
let
the
house
in
gerrard
square
and
removed
into
the
country
the
place
she
selected
was
a
tiny
village
named
lyngates
two
miles
from
the
station
at
netherton
and
twenty
miles
away
from
harlingden
its
pure
air
gravel
soil
and
record
of
sunshine
were
exactly
what
daphne
required
the
boys
could
go
in
to
town
every
day
by
train
and
thus
continue
at
king
james
school
and
avelyn
who
was
sufficiently
like
daphne
to
make
the
fatigue
of
a
daily
train
journey
seem
a
risky
experiment
could
be
sent
as
a
weekly
boarder
to
silverside
by
a
most
fortunate
chance
watson
came
across
the
very
little
property
she
wanted
it
was
an
old
with
a
few
outbuildings
at
the
back
and
a
field
or
two
for
poultry
the
doctor
had
suggested
that
daphne
should
interest
herself
in
poultry
it
was
smaller
by
far
than
no
gerrard
square
but
big
enough
for
their
requirements
with
present
war
prices
and
what
it
is
and
four
children
to
educate
i
consider
i
very
wise
to
make
the
move
she
decided
though
i
should
never
have
had
the
courage
to
do
it
if
sir
basil
hunter
had
been
so
emphatic
so
the
house
gardens
outbuildings
and
fields
that
composed
the
small
holding
were
bought
and
paid
for
and
formally
transferred
by
deed
from
their
former
owner
george
hethersedge
yeoman
to
the
possession
of
helena
watson
widow
and
the
bargain
was
complete
that
it
was
a
bargain
the
children
had
no
doubt
so
many
extra
things
were
included
that
were
never
even
mentioned
in
the
the
thrushes
and
blackbirds
and
tits
in
the
garden
the
wagtails
that
flitted
up
and
down
the
little
stream
the
owls
that
sat
and
hooted
in
the
elm
tree
at
dusk
the
wild
bees
nest
in
the
bank
the
ferns
in
the
crannies
of
the
old
wall
the
morning
view
when
the
sun
shone
over
the
valley
and
the
calm
quiet
sunsets
when
the
sky
was
aflame
with
rose
and
violet
it
was
the
most
exciting
experience
to
explore
their
new
kingdom
they
were
always
making
fresh
discoveries
up
till
now
beyond
their
annual
summer
holiday
at
some
seaside
resort
they
had
had
no
practical
knowledge
of
the
country
to
live
side
by
side
with
nature
was
like
being
transferred
into
another
world
to
watson
no
less
than
to
her
children
the
change
was
welcome
she
had
often
pored
over
nature
books
from
the
library
and
they
had
been
wont
to
stir
in
her
a
vague
yearning
to
get
away
from
bricks
and
mortar
and
chimneys
and
spend
a
sylvan
year
somewhere
far
from
the
sound
of
trams
or
steam
hooters
she
chafed
sometimes
against
the
monotony
of
her
daily
shopping
and
household
cares
she
longed
for
lanes
and
woods
but
there
seldom
seemed
time
to
go
for
walks
at
harlingden
it
was
a
long
way
from
gerrard
square
into
the
fields
we
are
such
creatures
of
habit
that
it
had
never
struck
her
to
uproot
herself
and
reorder
the
lives
of
herself
and
her
children
and
if
daphne
had
not
forgotten
her
galoshes
and
thus
brought
about
the
visit
of
sir
basil
hunter
the
family
might
have
remained
town
birds
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
as
it
was
they
stepped
into
a
fresh
inheritance
they
named
the
house
walden
after
thoreau
famous
a
book
which
her
mother
loved
and
which
avelyn
was
just
beginning
to
read
and
appreciate
the
magic
of
its
radiant
love
of
nature
and
the
breadth
of
its
philosophy
appealed
to
her
strongly
though
the
watsons
walden
was
quite
unpretentious
it
was
certainly
more
comfortable
than
the
shanty
in
concord
massachusetts
where
henry
david
thoreau
spent
his
immortal
two
years
and
two
months
there
was
a
on
each
side
of
the
little
hall
a
big
kitchen
and
pantry
behind
and
four
bedrooms
upstairs
outside
across
the
yard
was
a
cottage
with
a
lower
room
which
could
be
used
as
a
den
for
fretwork
painting
carpentering
or
the
pursuit
of
any
other
cherished
hobbies
and
an
upper
storey
containing
two
extra
bedrooms
for
emergencies
the
stable
and
barn
were
interesting
and
held
dim
cobwebby
recesses
where
bats
hung
head
downwards
and
a
brown
owl
sometimes
perched
blinking
upon
the
in
front
was
a
small
raised
garden
bordered
by
a
very
wide
stone
wall
the
house
stood
on
the
slope
of
a
steep
hill
so
that
this
wall
overtopped
the
road
below
like
a
crag
when
you
leaned
your
arms
on
its
golden
ivy
blossom
or
sombre
berries
and
smooth
leaves
you
could
look
out
over
a
tract
of
country
that
spread
for
miles
green
meadows
hazel
copses
bursting
into
leaf
thick
woods
that
hid
the
stream
whose
rushing
waters
yet
made
themselves
heard
the
reedy
reaches
of
a
river
and
hills
that
melted
faint
and
blue
into
a
misty
horizon
there
was
a
patch
of
gravel
in
front
of
the
wall
and
a
rustic
garden
seat
dilapidated
but
firm
enough
for
occupation
the
site
made
a
natural
outdoor
parlour
a
yew
tree
grown
slantwise
with
the
prevailing
wind
formed
an
umbrella
overhead
at
the
side
of
the
cottage
between
the
yard
and
the
kitchen
garden
purled
a
shallow
little
brook
at
the
edge
of
which
grew
watercresses
and
marsh
marigolds
it
was
spanned
by
a
bridge
made
of
rough
slabs
of
stone
beyond
the
stables
lay
a
couple
of
small
meadows
containing
an
upper
reach
of
the
stream
and
a
little
marshy
tract
interspersed
with
gorse
and
alder
bushes
the
watson
family
had
reviewed
the
whole
premises
slowly
critically
and
with
unbounded
satisfaction
it
the
sort
of
place
you
read
about
in
a
novel
sighed
daphne
whose
tastes
were
romantic
somehow
you
feel
as
if
anything
could
happen
here
interesting
things
i
mean
mysteries
and
tragedies
and
and
even
love
affairs
finished
avelyn
promptly
perhaps
they
may
sometime
avelyn
was
at
the
stage
when
life
is
full
of
dreams
it
was
her
constant
amusement
to
imagine
all
kinds
of
delightful
but
wildly
improbable
future
happenings
for
daphne
for
herself
and
for
the
boys
the
number
of
castles
in
the
air
which
she
constructed
would
have
built
a
city
they
were
all
shadowy
and
unsubstantial
but
none
the
less
fascinating
for
that
walden
appeared
to
her
as
to
daphne
an
appropriate
setting
for
golden
visions
david
and
anthony
still
in
the
age
of
blunt
uncompromising
frankness
regarded
the
new
home
from
a
practical
standpoint
it
decided
david
i
have
a
thingumjig
what
call
it
lathe
i
mean
inside
that
cottage
and
a
joiner
bench
there
a
man
in
the
village
who
says
he
got
one
to
sell
cheap
and
a
vice
with
it
i
going
to
make
a
rabbit
hutch
and
all
sorts
of
things
there
are
trout
in
that
part
of
the
stream
up
the
field
beamed
anthony
not
very
big
ones
but
certainly
trout
i
saw
them
jump
the
boy
who
brought
the
telegram
yesterday
told
me
that
he
catches
them
with
his
hands
he
knows
of
sixteen
birds
nests
on
the
road
to
the
station
and
he
got
a
young
hedgehog
at
home
i
going
to
just
sit
and
sit
in
the
field
when
it
getting
dark
till
i
see
one
for
myself
i
shall
grow
ten
years
younger
when
i
had
a
summer
here
announced
watson
to
her
flock
you
wo
know
your
poor
old
mother
very
soon
the
country
air
making
her
so
frisky
and
juvenile
she
wants
to
run
about
like
a
girl
muvvie
darling
we
love
you
in
your
skittish
moods
implored
avelyn
when
you
wear
that
short
skirt
and
that
rush
hat
you
do
look
a
day
older
than
auntie
belle
truly
you
never
climbed
up
step
ladders
in
gerrard
square
i
begun
to
do
many
things
i
never
did
before
laughed
watson
partly
from
necessity
if
i
could
have
found
anybody
else
to
go
up
the
step
ladder
perhaps
i
should
have
tried
we
all
got
to
work
if
we
want
to
make
the
place
look
nice
it
be
worth
it
when
finished
walden
had
been
empty
for
two
years
before
its
owner
sold
it
and
though
it
was
in
a
fair
state
of
repair
as
regarded
masonry
and
woodwork
it
sadly
needed
decorating
the
question
of
its
repapering
and
painting
had
been
the
one
hitch
in
the
proceedings
for
when
watson
had
sought
to
obtain
estimates
for
its
renovation
she
found
that
in
the
present
shortage
of
workmen
no
firm
would
undertake
to
carry
out
a
job
so
far
in
the
country
for
three
horrible
days
matters
had
seemed
at
a
and
the
purchase
of
walden
not
quite
concluded
had
trembled
in
the
balance
but
daphne
white
cheeks
brought
all
watson
native
obstinacy
to
the
fore
she
was
determined
not
to
be
vanquished
she
enquired
in
the
village
and
secured
the
services
of
an
old
soldier
who
used
to
be
at
the
vicarage
and
with
his
experienced
aid
and
the
willing
though
unskilled
hands
of
her
young
flock
she
determined
to
do
up
walden
herself
she
secured
lodgings
for
a
few
weeks
at
a
farm
close
by
and
the
family
devoted
the
easter
holidays
to
the
purpose
it
was
a
new
experience
for
them
and
they
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
armed
with
pails
of
distemper
and
whitewash
brushes
they
splashed
away
at
the
walls
painted
woodwork
stained
floors
or
laid
linoleum
they
made
a
delightful
discovery
in
the
for
when
they
came
to
tear
down
the
old
wall
paper
they
found
an
overmantel
of
ancient
oak
beams
the
fireplace
was
large
and
with
ingle
nooks
on
either
side
the
woodwork
had
been
completely
covered
with
paper
and
plaster
but
when
this
was
cleared
away
and
it
was
cleaned
stained
and
varnished
it
presented
a
most
quaint
and
handsome
appearance
the
great
beam
that
spanned
the
hearth
had
a
flat
surface
and
on
this
watson
decided
to
carve
a
motto
the
family
put
their
heads
together
over
it
for
many
days
they
looked
up
mottoes
in
books
and
consulted
their
friends
but
could
not
find
exactly
the
right
one
daphne
and
avelyn
were
in
favour
of
english
but
watson
and
the
boys
plumped
for
latin
and
finally
evolved
the
following
post
laborem
haec
requies
haec
felicitas
after
work
here
is
rest
and
happiness
when
you
finished
your
lessons
in
the
evenings
we
can
make
a
circle
round
the
fire
and
talk
about
the
day
doings
and
it
will
seem
a
centre
for
the
whole
house
and
for
our
lives
said
watson
i
believe
this
little
home
is
going
to
be
far
more
precious
to
us
than
gerrard
square
to
the
children
the
doing
up
of
the
establishment
was
the
utmost
fun
thoreau
himself
could
not
have
obtained
more
enjoyment
from
his
walden
than
they
did
from
theirs
there
were
many
humorous
incidents
as
when
anthony
sat
down
in
the
colour
wash
pail
or
when
daphne
dropped
a
pot
of
pink
paint
on
the
top
of
david
head
or
when
avelyn
poured
in
paraffin
by
mistake
instead
of
methylated
spirit
to
thin
the
varnish
it
was
a
proud
day
when
at
last
colour
wash
and
paint
were
dry
and
the
floor
was
swept
and
cleaned
and
the
vans
arrived
and
the
furniture
was
carried
in
watson
had
sold
most
of
the
heavy
possessions
which
they
owned
in
gerrard
square
and
had
bought
in
their
place
tasteful
antiques
which
suited
the
house
far
better
and
gave
it
an
air
of
quaint
culture
and
comfort
when
all
was
arranged
it
looked
a
charming
little
abode
and
thoroughly
in
harmony
from
the
black
beams
of
its
ingle
nook
to
the
carved
settle
and
oak
table
or
the
framed
samplers
on
its
walls
many
surprising
incidents
happened
in
the
first
days
of
occupation
very
early
one
morning
as
daphne
and
avelyn
lay
in
bed
they
were
awakened
by
a
tweeting
and
whirr
of
wings
and
found
that
a
pair
of
swallows
had
flown
in
through
the
open
window
and
were
whirling
overhead
evidently
with
designs
on
the
big
cross
beam
for
nesting
purposes
the
sight
of
the
girls
who
sat
up
in
bed
seemed
to
annoy
them
for
they
twittered
with
anger
scintillated
rapidly
round
the
room
then
flashed
out
through
the
window
into
the
spring
sunshine
well
exclaimed
daphne
this
certainly
is
living
in
the
country
actually
swallows
in
our
bedroom
the
poor
darlings
declared
avelyn
they
had
a
horrible
disappointment
they
made
up
their
minds
to
have
their
nest
on
that
beam
i
remember
martin
jones
pulled
down
a
swallow
nest
before
he
whitewashed
and
said
they
had
built
there
last
year
and
had
got
in
because
the
window
was
broken
they
must
think
we
dreadful
intruders
they
were
scolding
us
as
hard
as
they
could
in
bird
language
shall
we
hang
out
a
notice
let
eligible
quarters
for
swallows
laughed
daphne
we
might
even
put
nesting
boxes
round
the
walls
and
extend
the
invitation
to
other
birds
to
anyone
who
wished
to
study
natural
history
walden
certainly
offered
advantages
there
was
a
friendly
robin
that
domesticated
itself
and
would
fly
into
the
at
meal
times
hop
on
to
the
table
and
even
perch
upon
the
loaf
he
would
haunt
the
kitchen
in
quest
of
crumbs
and
grew
so
cheeky
that
when
ethel
the
maid
who
resented
his
occasional
flounders
into
her
pudding
dishes
drove
him
out
through
the
window
he
would
merely
fly
round
the
corner
and
pop
in
again
through
the
open
door
as
at
first
the
watsons
possessed
neither
dog
nor
cat
their
garden
became
for
that
spring
at
any
rate
a
veritable
bird
sanctuary
a
pied
built
in
the
thatch
of
the
a
pair
of
wrens
swung
their
dainty
cradle
under
a
pine
bough
a
nettle
creeper
nested
in
the
long
grass
of
the
orchard
cole
tits
and
blue
tits
haunted
the
yew
tree
a
family
of
young
water
wagtails
issued
from
a
hole
under
the
stone
bridge
and
a
wood
pigeon
took
possession
of
the
top
storey
of
a
fir
tree
to
say
nothing
of
the
blackbirds
thrushes
robins
and
other
everyday
birds
that
availed
themselves
of
the
hospitality
of
the
bushes
i
thought
i
owned
walden
but
i
beginning
to
doubt
it
said
watson
it
seems
to
me
that
the
wild
creatures
put
in
a
prior
claim
and
come
unasked
to
share
it
they
welcome
bless
murmured
avelyn
fondling
a
and
quite
undismayed
young
which
she
had
temporarily
taken
from
its
nest
just
outside
the
window
some
of
the
incidents
which
happened
were
decidedly
funny
the
watsons
were
not
used
to
the
country
and
had
to
learn
by
experience
one
morning
they
had
left
some
washing
in
the
field
and
found
that
a
neighbour
calves
had
strayed
through
a
hole
in
the
hedge
and
were
contentedly
sucking
stockings
and
pyjamas
and
reducing
them
to
a
pulp
it
took
several
sharp
lessons
before
the
family
grasped
that
cardinal
rule
of
country
life
keep
your
gate
shut
on
the
first
sunday
of
their
occupation
they
had
gone
to
church
and
on
returning
had
strolled
into
the
to
find
three
pigs
comfortably
in
possession
a
wild
scene
ensued
for
the
intruders
instead
of
allowing
themselves
to
be
chased
through
the
door
careered
madly
round
and
round
the
table
squeaking
and
grunting
in
protest
and
finally
jumped
on
to
the
sofa
and
made
their
exit
through
the
open
window
knocking
over
books
and
pots
of
geraniums
in
their
hurried
flight
and
completely
flattening
a
bed
of
young
pansies
that
had
just
been
planted
one
night
the
family
who
had
sat
up
later
than
usual
heard
stealthy
steps
in
the
garden
and
fearful
of
burglars
issued
forth
in
a
body
armed
with
the
poker
and
other
implements
of
aggression
only
to
find
a
melancholy
donkey
cropping
the
grass
beyond
the
laurel
bushes
with
apparent
appreciation
of
its
superior
juiciness
these
little
adventures
however
added
a
spice
of
excitement
to
their
existence
they
agreed
that
life
at
walden
was
supremely
interesting
daphne
who
was
nearly
eighteen
had
finished
with
lessons
and
for
the
summer
term
watson
allowed
avelyn
also
to
stay
at
home
and
run
wild
she
had
been
growing
fast
and
a
rest
was
considered
good
for
her
david
and
anthony
left
the
house
every
morning
at
seven
walked
to
netherton
station
caught
the
train
to
harlingden
and
proceeded
to
king
james
school
where
they
spent
the
day
and
dined
returning
home
by
about
six
in
the
evening
they
were
sturdy
boys
of
fourteen
and
twelve
and
enjoyed
the
daily
expedition
time
had
often
hung
heavy
on
their
hands
out
of
school
hours
in
gerrard
square
it
was
now
agreeably
filled
in
with
a
railway
journey
and
a
walk
across
fields
where
birds
nests
might
be
found
and
where
they
sometimes
saw
stoats
and
squirrels
to
the
whole
family
the
first
sylvan
spring
and
summer
had
been
one
long
round
of
delight
by
the
end
of
august
they
felt
that
town
had
faded
away
from
their
mental
vision
and
that
they
had
become
sons
of
the
soil
in
september
avelyn
began
school
again
as
a
weekly
boarder
at
silverside
she
had
left
the
hawthorns
the
preceding
christmas
and
the
nine
months
absence
with
the
intervening
removal
to
lyngates
had
very
much
blurred
its
memory
she
had
liked
some
of
the
girls
though
she
had
never
made
any
really
intimate
friends
there
she
had
been
mildly
sorry
to
leave
but
the
regret
had
soon
worn
off
she
had
come
to
silverside
quite
ready
to
hallmark
herself
with
the
stamp
of
her
new
school
and
centre
her
interests
there
to
find
that
the
greater
part
of
the
hawthorns
was
now
incorporated
with
silverside
and
that
the
boarders
identified
her
with
her
old
set
had
struck
her
somewhat
as
a
shock
what
attitude
she
should
adopt
she
could
not
quite
determine
she
wanted
to
think
over
the
situation
carefully
before
she
committed
herself
to
either
side
chapter
iv
an
encounter
the
little
freehold
of
walden
was
a
triangle
consisting
of
about
two
acres
of
land
its
base
abutted
on
the
high
road
and
its
apex
was
wedged
into
another
and
much
larger
estate
the
owner
of
this
property
resided
at
lyngates
hall
the
watsons
had
as
yet
only
seen
him
in
the
distance
but
they
knew
from
report
that
he
was
a
naturalized
german
and
that
his
name
was
hockheimer
they
had
heard
rumours
that
he
was
not
popular
in
the
district
so
long
as
he
kept
his
live
stock
on
his
own
side
of
the
hedge
watson
did
not
concern
herself
about
her
neighbour
when
his
cows
strayed
into
her
field
she
drove
them
back
and
had
the
gap
securely
mended
to
prevent
further
trespassing
she
considered
that
to
be
the
end
of
the
matter
and
did
not
give
hockheimer
another
thought
as
for
the
young
people
they
had
not
yet
realized
his
existence
they
discovered
it
one
day
quite
suddenly
and
unpleasantly
the
second
monday
morning
after
her
start
at
school
avelyn
was
walking
to
the
station
with
her
brothers
to
catch
the
train
the
weather
was
still
fine
and
and
the
late
september
sunshine
gilded
the
yellowing
nut
trees
and
turned
the
in
the
long
webs
of
gossamer
into
diamonds
there
was
an
exhilaration
in
being
up
and
out
so
early
the
three
marched
along
very
cheerily
chatting
as
they
went
as
they
rounded
the
corner
beyond
the
smithy
they
could
see
about
two
hundred
yards
in
front
of
them
a
little
figure
in
blue
sports
coat
and
also
making
its
way
in
the
direction
of
netherton
who
that
girl
asked
anthony
we
see
her
every
day
she
goes
in
to
harlingden
by
the
same
train
that
we
do
she
must
be
going
to
school
because
she
always
has
a
satchel
of
books
with
her
it
looks
like
pamela
reynolds
returned
avelyn
she
new
at
silverside
this
term
and
now
you
speak
of
it
i
remember
somebody
told
me
she
came
from
lyngates
but
i
quite
forgotten
all
about
it
till
this
moment
i
do
even
know
where
she
lives
shall
we
sprint
and
catch
her
up
the
watsons
hurried
their
footsteps
and
by
dint
of
what
might
be
termed
a
forced
march
overtook
pamela
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
avelyn
greeted
her
by
name
from
behind
she
turned
surprised
she
was
a
girl
of
nearly
fourteen
with
honest
brown
eyes
a
clear
pale
skin
and
hair
which
curled
at
the
ends
and
had
a
tendency
to
make
little
rings
round
her
forehead
she
was
really
pretty
when
she
smiled
hallo
she
exclaimed
i
never
expected
to
see
you
here
are
you
avelyn
watson
i
thought
you
were
a
boarder
so
i
am
but
only
a
weekly
one
i
come
home
from
friday
to
monday
do
you
like
being
a
day
girl
is
it
a
long
way
to
go
every
morning
i
do
mind
i
used
to
have
much
farther
to
go
to
school
when
we
lived
in
canada
used
you
to
live
in
canada
yes
i
was
born
there
i
only
come
to
england
lately
i
have
met
you
about
lyngates
before
we
only
been
here
a
month
who
just
my
mother
and
i
do
you
like
england
pretty
well
it
too
cultivated
after
canada
all
these
little
walls
and
hedges
to
divide
the
tiny
fields
make
me
laugh
it
like
a
country
and
i
hate
the
high
roads
look
here
there
a
short
cut
through
that
wood
to
the
station
i
go
that
way
nearly
every
day
will
you
come
the
watsons
were
perfectly
ready
to
explore
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
new
path
or
they
helped
pamela
to
open
the
gate
and
followed
her
into
the
wood
the
long
vista
of
trees
was
delightful
the
short
grass
under
foot
was
a
vivid
emerald
green
there
were
patches
of
yellowing
bracken
clumps
of
crimson
and
orange
spindle
bushes
covered
with
scarlet
berries
and
trails
of
pale
late
honeysuckle
twining
over
the
brambles
from
the
direction
they
were
taking
they
must
be
cutting
off
a
long
corner
on
their
way
to
the
station
they
had
walked
for
perhaps
a
few
minutes
and
were
strolling
on
chatting
as
they
went
when
they
suddenly
heard
a
shout
in
front
of
them
and
someone
came
crashing
through
the
undergrowth
and
stood
barring
their
path
the
somebody
in
question
was
undoubtedly
very
angry
he
was
a
fair
short
stout
roundabout
little
man
with
a
big
blond
moustache
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
large
teeth
gleamed
unpleasantly
as
he
spoke
but
he
not
only
spoke
he
shouted
what
are
you
doing
here
do
you
know
this
wood
private
property
you
no
business
to
be
in
it
get
out
as
fast
as
you
can
the
same
way
you
came
be
quick
about
it
or
i
know
the
reason
why
i
could
have
you
all
taken
up
for
trespassing
if
i
liked
why
pamela
was
standing
staring
at
the
surly
objector
with
a
look
of
mingled
amazement
disgust
and
defiance
in
her
clear
eyes
it
my
fault
uncle
she
replied
calmly
it
a
short
cut
to
the
station
through
this
wood
and
i
brought
these
friends
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
over
the
word
with
me
i
come
this
way
nearly
every
morning
then
you
wo
do
it
again
thundered
the
short
man
do
let
me
ever
catch
you
here
any
more
or
any
of
your
friends
you
may
understand
that
once
and
for
all
and
i
be
obeyed
go
back
i
tell
you
he
waved
them
savagely
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
through
which
they
had
come
may
we
go
on
just
this
once
pleaded
pamela
i
afraid
we
miss
our
train
then
miss
it
what
do
i
care
it
your
own
faults
for
trespassing
and
i
hope
you
all
get
into
trouble
at
school
you
richly
deserve
it
back
i
tell
you
you
young
rascals
with
an
angry
man
raving
like
a
lunatic
in
their
path
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
beat
a
retreat
as
speedily
as
they
could
when
they
had
passed
through
the
gate
david
looked
at
his
watch
five
past
eight
thunder
we
shall
have
to
sprint
if
we
want
to
catch
that
train
there
was
no
time
for
comment
all
four
immediately
set
off
running
each
perhaps
was
buoyed
up
with
an
obstinate
determination
to
reach
the
station
by
in
spite
of
the
unamiable
hopes
of
the
owner
of
the
wood
they
only
wished
he
could
be
there
to
see
them
defeat
his
prophecy
in
spite
of
such
hindrances
as
bumping
satchels
streaming
hair
and
in
anthony
case
a
trailing
bootlace
they
panted
along
and
covered
the
ground
somehow
they
could
hear
the
train
rumbling
in
the
distance
and
could
see
the
smoke
of
the
engine
as
they
raced
down
the
last
hill
by
the
greatest
of
good
luck
a
special
cargo
of
and
butter
baskets
had
to
be
placed
that
morning
in
the
luggage
van
and
the
extra
two
minutes
spent
in
stowing
them
away
saved
the
situation
the
guard
was
just
waving
his
green
flag
as
the
watsons
and
pamela
scarlet
with
their
exertions
popped
into
the
last
carriage
for
a
few
minutes
they
were
too
breathless
to
speak
it
was
anthony
who
first
found
words
well
of
all
raggy
old
lunatics
commend
me
to
that
one
strafe
the
baity
old
blighter
gasped
david
i
never
heard
of
such
meanness
put
in
avelyn
actually
to
us
to
miss
our
train
i
have
knocked
him
over
for
two
pins
declared
david
savagely
wish
we
tried
growled
anthony
i
do
know
who
he
is
but
he
no
gentleman
exploded
avelyn
divided
between
her
ruffled
clothes
and
her
ruffled
feelings
sorry
pamela
if
he
your
uncle
but
i
ca
help
saying
what
i
think
pamela
was
leaning
back
in
a
corner
she
had
taken
off
her
blue
and
was
trying
to
her
hair
she
looked
up
quickly
you
need
mind
me
you
can
say
anything
you
like
about
him
i
only
wish
he
was
my
uncle
we
do
choose
our
relations
do
we
nobody
choose
him
if
they
could
help
it
i
should
think
replied
avelyn
frankly
what
his
name
mr
hockheimer
the
hockheimer
who
lives
at
the
hall
yes
why
he
a
german
is
he
yes
but
i

as
english

be
then
how
are
you
related
to
him
he
married
my
aunt
oh
illustration
do
you
know
this
wood
private
property
he
shouted
there
was
a
long
pause
and
then
anthony
volunteered
if
auntie
belle
was
to
marry
a
german
i
never
call
her
again
never
it
was
before
the
war
and
she
dead
now
groaned
pamela
uncle
fritz
has
lived
twenty
years
in
england
how
is
it
he
not
interned
asked
david
he
naturalized

call
him
i
rather

but
i
got
to
i
never
seen
him
till
i
came
here
a
month
ago
and
you
do
like
him
for
answer
pamela
suddenly
burst
into
a
storm
of
passionate
tears
like
him
i
hate
him
oh
why
did
we
ever
leave
canada
and
come
to
england
it
wretched
here
and
i
miserable
i
like
to
run
away
then
dabbing
her
eyes
with
her
there
do
take
any
notice
of
me
please
i
get
these
fits
sometimes
i
feel
better
soon
please
do
talk
any
more
to
me
about
uncle
the
watsons
glanced
at
her
compassionately
and
began
to
converse
among
themselves
upon
other
topics
pamela
stared
hard
out
of
the
window
blinked
and
presently
regained
her
composure
when
the
train
arrived
at
harlingden
she
and
avelyn
walked
to
silverside
together
but
they
talked
of
school
concerns
and
did
not
reopen
the
subject
of
hockheimer
before
this
happening
avelyn
though
she
had
been
vaguely
aware
of
pamela
existence
had
not
mentally
singled
her
out
among
the
general
crowd
of
her
schoolfellows
from
that
monday
morning
she
began
to
take
an
interest
in
her
she
smiled
at
her
when
they
passed
on
the
stairs
and
spoke
to
her
occasionally
in
the
playground
as
they
were
in
different
forms
they
had
few
opportunities
of
meeting
and
even
at
dinner
the
boarders
sat
at
a
different
table
from
the
day
girls
avelyn
looked
out
for
pamela
on
friday
afternoon
but
she
was
not
at
the
station
she
had
either
left
school
early
or
was
travelling
by
a
later
train
she
seemed
such
an
attractive
pathetic
little
figure
that
avelyn
curiosity
was
aroused
she
wanted
to
know
where
pamela
lived
and
more
about
her
she
cast
round
in
her
mind
for
any
likely
source
of
information
and
decided
upon
garside
a
fat
kindly
old
soul
who
owned
a
farm
close
to
walden
and
was
disposed
to
be
neighbourly
and
talkative
on
the
excuse
of
going
for
the
weekly
butter
she
tapped
at
the
house
door
and
was
ushered
in
garside
was
busy
washing
pots
but
she
placed
a
chair
for
her
visitor
fetched
the
butter
from
the
dairy
and
as
she
packed
it
in
the
basket
glided
off
into
conversation
once
started
it
was
difficult
to
stop
her
or
to
lead
her
away
from
the
various
topics
upon
which
her
tongue
ran
so
glibly
it
was
only
after
much
manoeuvring
and
a
considerable
amount
of
patience
that
avelyn
could
get
her
to
concentrate
on
the
subject
of
pamela
reynolds
even
then
her
mind
a
young
lady
with
dark
hair
that
wears
a
blue
yes
i
seen
her
not
that
i
like
and
i
would
get
one
for
hilda
though
she
begged
hard
i
bought
her
a
felt
instead
hockheimer
niece
yes
he
lives
at
the
hall
though
many
think
he
no
right
to
be
there
and
if
i
my
way
i
say
an
internment
camp
was
the
right
place
for
him
with
two
sons
in
the
trenches
it
does
give
one
any
patience
for
these
naturalized
germans
coming
and
turning
out
decent
english
folk
too
that
ought
to
be
there
instead
of
him
it
was
a
queer
business
and
people
ought
to
make
their
wills
properly
before
they
come
to
die
instead
of
leaving
them
i
made
mine
and
divided
what
i
got
equal
share
and
share
alike
among
my
six
children
so
that
there
wo
be
any
quarrelling
after
my
funeral
for
i
told
them
beforehand
what
to
expect
and
people
say
the
old
squire
ghost
haunts
the
hall
and
small
wonder
though
it
not
much
use
for
a
ghost
ca
sign
a
will
and
he
should
have
had
the
sense
to
do
it
while
he
was
alive
garside
statements
were
so
rambling
and
involved
that
it
took
avelyn
a
very
long
time
indeed
to
sift
the
information
she
wanted
from
among
the
large
number
of
superfluous
details
supplied
by
her
loquacious
neighbour
by
dint
of
pertinacity
and
tact
however
she
pieced
together
the
following
pamela
ancestors
had
for
many
generations
been
squires
of
lyngates
and
had
resided
at
the
hall
her
grandfather
george
reynolds
had
lived
there
until
his
death
two
years
ago
garside
could
remember
him
since
her
girlhood
a
tall
handsome
man
with
a
brown
beard
who
rode
about
the
country
on
a
favourite
white
horse
named
champion
he
had
been
a
good
landlord
and
was
well
liked
in
the
neighbourhood
his
wife
had
died
early
and
left
two
children
a
son
and
daughter
the
son
leonard
had
been
a
lad
and
it
was
said
in
the
village
that
he
and
his
father
did
not
get
on
well
together
there
was
some
upset
and
a
quarrel
the
rights
of
which
nobody
ever
knew
for
the
squire
was
too
proud
to
air
his
troubles
and
kept
family
skeletons
securely
locked
in
their
cupboards
at
any
rate
leonard
had
gone
away
to
canada
and
started
farming
and
had
never
returned
to
his
old
home
though
he
had
written
that
he
was
married
and
later
on
that
he
had
a
daughter
this
was
all
the
news
that
lyngates
people
had
heard
of
him
in
fourteen
years
whether
he
had
prospered
or
otherwise
on
his
canadian
ranch
they
did
not
know
squire
reynolds
other
child
miss
dora
had
been
a
pretty
girl
and
her
father
favourite
many
years
went
by
however
before
she
married
she
had
been
fond
of
hunting
and
used
to
look
very
smart
riding
to
hounds
in
her
neat
habit
it
was
at
a
meet
that
she
had
first
met
hockheimer
he
rented
a
in
the
neighbourhood
and
came
down
frequently
from
london
for
week
ends
nobody
could
understand
how
this
naturalized
german
had
obtained
such
a
hold
over
miss
dora
and
her
father
though
it
was
rumoured
that
he
had
reinvested
the
squire
money
for
him
to
great
advantage
being
a
city
man
he
was
well
acquainted
with
finance
miss
dora
was
long
past
her
first
youth
but
she
was
still
handsome
and
everyone
in
lyngates
had
said
that
she
was
far
too
good
for
hockheimer
the
village
worthies
however
were
not
consulted
and
the
wedding
took
place
a
year
afterwards
the
european
war
broke
out
there
was
great
comment
in
lyngates
on
the
position
of
hockheimer
but
he
had
proved
himself
to
be
a
naturalized
british
subject
and
declared
he
was
heart
and
soul
on
the
side
of
the
allies
he
had
been
very
energetic
on
local
committees
and
had
given
large
sums
to
the
belgian
fund
when
red
war
flamed
in
flanders
and
britain
summoned
all
her
sons
to
her
standard
leonard
reynolds
on
his
ranch
in
the
rockies
had
heard
the
call
and
answered
it
he
had
joined
one
of
the
first
canadian
contingents
and
had
come
over
the
sea
to
do
his
bit
for
the
motherland
leaving
his
wife
and
child
at
the
ranch
to
carry
on
the
brave
but
wellnigh
impossible
task
of
keeping
the
home
fires
burning
in
his
passage
through
england
he
had
had
hours
leave
and
had
visited
his
father
at
lyngates
the
villagers
had
seen
him
again
after
fourteen
years
absence
and
had
admired
him
in
his
khaki
uniform
he
had
spoken
to
several
of
them
words
of
fire
and
patriotism
and
enthusiasm
for
the
coming
conflict
everybody
lived
for
the
newspapers
in
those
first
months
of
war
and
lyngates
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
in
and
cottage
they
read
of
the
retreat
from
mons
duke
son
and
oxford
graduate
and
city
clerk
scientist
shopman
and
alike
had
paid
the
great
sacrifice
and
the
name
of
leonard
reynolds
stood
among
them
the
squire
was
in
bed
at
the
time
recovering
from
a
severe
operation
the
news
was
broken
to
him
by
an
injudicious
nurse
at
a
crisis
in
his
illness
and
it
proved
his
in
his
few
last
gasping
words
he
had
tried
to
say
something
about
a
will
but
those
who
were
with
him
could
not
understand
what
he
meant
to
convey
with
the
incoherent
message
still
trembling
on
his
stricken
lips
he
had
passed
away
into
the
silence
he
was
buried
with
his
ancestors
in
lyngates
churchyard
but
there
was
no
cross
to
mark
the
grave
of
his
son
leonard
the
survivors
of
the
canadian
contingent
could
give
no
details
beyond
the
fact
that
a
certain
portion
of
them
had
been
utterly
wiped
out
by
a
terrific
explosion
it
was
impossible
to
identify
the
dead
war
was
reaping
a
red
harvest
of
human
lives
after
squire
reynolds
funeral
and
hockheimer
had
taken
possession
of
the
hall
though
search
was
made
everywhere
the
only
will
which
could
be
discovered
was
one
in
the
custody
of
the
family
solicitor
which
was
dated
fifteen
years
back
in
the
briefest
terms
it
left
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
his
daughter
and
the
estate
of
lyngates
to
his
son
but
in
the
event
of
the
death
of
either
the
survivor
was
to
inherit
the
whole
property
as
it
had
been
drawn
up
before
his
marriage
no
mention
was
made
in
it
of
leonard
wife
and
child
it
was
a
perfectly
valid
will
and
it
was
duly
proved
hockheimer
succeeding
to
the
entire
estate
of
her
late
father
she
lived
only
six
months
to
enjoy
it
and
was
laid
to
rest
with
her
dead
baby
in
her
arms
she
had
executed
a
will
bequeathing
everything
to
her
husband
so
that
hockheimer
the
naturalized
german
assumed
absolute
command
of
the
reynolds
property
meanwhile
matters
had
gone
hardly
with
the
wife
and
child
of
leonard
reynolds
it
had
been
impossible
for
them
to
farm
the
ranch
and
they
had
no
private
means
by
the
advice
of
her
friends
reynolds
had
sold
up
her
few
possessions
and
had
come
to
england
with
her
daughter
to
find
out
at
first
hand
from
the
lawyers
whether
any
provision
had
been
made
for
her
out
of
the
estate
the
solicitors
were
polite
and
sympathetic
they
acknowledged
the
keen
injustice
of
the
matter
but
assured
her
that
there
was
no
redress
and
according
to
british
law
hockheimer
had
full
rights
of
possession
in
the
lyngates
property
while
she
and
her
child
could
not
claim
so
much
as
a
solitary
farthing
they
represented
the
case
however
to
hockheimer
and
he
at
once
offered
reynolds
the
use
of
a
cottage
on
his
land
together
with
a
small
annual
income
and
promised
to
pay
for
pamela
education
at
a
day
school
in
harlingden
as
she
had
no
other
means
of
livelihood
reynolds
had
accepted
this
help
and
had
settled
down
at
lyngates
shortly
before
this
story
begins
she
was
a
fragile
little
woman
gentle
and
clinging
in
disposition
and
so
battered
by
misfortune
that
she
was
glad
to
rest
anywhere
where
she
could
find
a
home
she
received
hockheimer
dole
quite
gratefully
with
the
loss
of
her
husband
life
had
for
her
practically
stopped
through
her
daughter
it
held
a
kind
of
interest
she
welcomed
the
idea
of
pamela
attending
a
good
school
and
her
crushed
soul
even
began
to
indulge
in
timid
little
concerning
her
child
future
these
hopes
pathetic
and
tender
were
like
wild
sweet
violets
springing
up
over
the
desolation
of
a
pamela
viewed
the
situation
from
an
utterly
different
standpoint
she
had
inherited
her
grandfather
strength
of
character
along
with
the
reynolds
features
and
also
a
considerable
share
of
his
pride
her
early
life
in
canada
had
made
her
more
independent
than
most
english
girls
of
her
age
she
considered
that
by
all
rights
of
justice
an
equal
half
of
the
lyngates
estate
should
have
been
hers
and
that
her
uncle
hockheimer
had
managed
to
steal
her
inheritance
she
hated
to
accept
from
him
as
charity
what
she
felt
ought
to
have
been
her
own
and
she
bitterly
resented
the
patronizing
attitude
which
he
adopted
towards
herself
and
her
mother
she
too
had
her
and
most
of
them
centred
round
a
time
when
she
would
be
old
enough
to
shake
off
this
thraldom
of
dependence
and
strike
out
a
line
of
her
own
in
the
world
chapter
v
ructions
by
the
end
of
a
few
weeks
avelyn
began
to
feel
more
settled
down
in
her
new
quarters
at
silverside
the
old
pupils
might
regret
the
former
régime
but
she
was
tolerably
satisfied
with
the
new
she
was
in
the
fifth
form
and
found
the
work
not
too
arduous
and
liked
miss
kennedy
her
teacher
she
had
been
accustomed
to
the
bustle
of
a
large
school
and
though
laura
talbot
might
rave
against
the
crowded
conditions
to
avelyn
it
was
amusing
to
be
in
a
room
crammed
full
of
girls
school
is
a
separate
world
of
its
own
and
often
a
curious
one
to
outsiders
and
to
its
principal
silverside
might
appear
as
an
enterprise
that
was
growing
and
prospering
exceedingly
its
numbers
had
suddenly
more
than
doubled
it
had
fresh
teachers
and
was
going
to
build
a
and
a
gymnasium
nothing
could
seemingly
have
more
hope
of
success
inwardly
however
it
was
a
seething
whirl
of
opposing
factions
the
old
and
the
new
did
not
readily
amalgamate
the
boarders
were
jealous
of
their
rights
and
would
not
yield
an
inch
of
the
privileged
position
they
had
always
been
wont
to
occupy
while
the
hawthorners
accustomed
to
the
absolute
democracy
of
a
day
school
could
not
and
would
not
understand
why
boarders
should
expect
to
have
any
privileges
at
all
trouble
began
on
the
very
second
day
of
term
adah
in
her
new
capacity
of
head
girl
had
pinned
a
paper
on
the
notice
board
announcing
a
general
meeting
of
the
dramatic
society
for
in
the
studio
the
old
members
turned
up
at
the
time
named
to
find
a
group
of
hawthorners
already
in
possession
of
the
room
adah
after
waiting
a
minute
glanced
at
the
clock
and
coughed
significantly
then
as
this
produced
no
result
she
remarked
wo
you
be
rather
late
if
you
not
getting
home
soon
we
do
much
mind
returned
annie
broadside
easily
well
the
fact
is
we
want
to
use
this
room
continued
adah
going
to
have
a
meeting
i
know
that
why
we
come
adah
eyebrows
elevated
themselves
to
an
astonishing
angle
you
come
to
our
meeting
she
exclaimed
incredulously
certainly
we
have
why
not
annie
asked
the
question
aggressively
because
you
not
members
of
the
dramatic
but
we
want
to
join
adah
turned
to
her
friends
who
stood
looking
scornfully
at
the
intruders
did
you
hear
that
she
remarked
they
actually
want
to
join
the
dramatic
cheek
murmured
consie
and
the
others
giggled
and
why
should
we
join
flamed
gladys
wilks
why
because
you
day
girls
and
the
dramatic
only
for
boarders
that
the
reason
it
no
reason
at
all
answered
maggie
stuart
sharply
the
boarders
have
no
right
to
monopolize
any
society
it
ought
to
be
free
and
open
to
the
whole
school
but
it
ca
snapped
adah
surely
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
it
would
work
we
have
all
our
rehearsals
in
the
evenings
when
day
girls
could
possibly
come
you
could
fix
them
from
four
to
five
instead
suggested
annie
we
not
going
to
alter
our
arrangements
for
anybody
returned
adah
tartly
the
boarders
have
always
run
the
dramatic
added
consie
we
like
to
begin
our
meeting
please
when
we
can
have
the
studio
to
ourselves
oh
very
well
keep
your
wretched
society
to
yourselves
if
you
want
yapped
annie
but
i
tell
you
this
at
any
rate
i
think
it
most
monstrously
unfair
you
need
expect
us
to
help
you
with
any
of
your
schemes
for
we
just
sha
do
excite
yourselves
we
have
asked
you
sneered
consie
freezingly
as
the
hawthorners
flounced
out
of
the
room
at
first
the
committee
was
too
agitated
to
discuss
business
it
was
ablaze
with
indignation
at
the
impudence
of
mere
day
girls
aspiring
to
join
the
select
circle
how
could
we
let
them
fluttered
joyce
edwards
to
begin
with
there
would
be
enough
parts
to
go
round
nor
enough
costumes
dear
me
we
should
have
the
juniors
expecting
to
appear
on
the
platform
what
next
i
wonder
we
seniors
have
always
done
the
acting
and
let
the
kids
and
day
girls
make
the
audience
and
we
go
on
doing
so
declared
adah
we
the
prefects
and
we
manage
the
school
affairs
as
we
like
without
interference
from
anybody
the
decision
about
the
dramatic
was
the
same
as
regarded
most
of
the
other
societies
the
boarders
kept
them
jealously
to
themselves
the
day
girls
grumbled
even
protested
indignantly
but
they
were
powerless
to
make
any
change
the
four
prefects
were
all
boarders
and
exercised
their
authority
for
their
own
advantage
miss
thompson
had
no
idea
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
appointing
as
school
officers
girls
who
had
been
with
her
for
some
years
she
thought
she
was
safeguarding
the
tone
of
silverside
and
preserving
its
traditions
intact
she
had
certainly
no
intention
of
establishing
an
oligarchy
yet
in
effect
that
was
what
had
resulted
the
members
of
the
boarders
league
felt
pledged
to
support
one
another
against
all
outsiders
and
every
activity
of
the
school
was
in
the
hands
of
a
clique
adah
as
head
girl
was
intensely
patronizing
she
was
puffed
up
with
pride
in
her
new
office
and
would
explain
silverside
customs
with
an
airy
superiority
which
aggravated
the
hawthorners
continually
their
injured
souls
rallied
round
annie
broadside
annie
was
a
born
leader
she
keenly
resented
the
state
of
affairs
and
meant
to
show
fight
she
only
waited
a
suitable
opportunity
and
at
length
it
came
for
the
first
few
weeks
of
term
the
boarders
had
been
busy
with
various
affairs
on
saturdays
and
had
contented
themselves
with
an
occasional
game
of
tennis
and
croquet
at
the
beginning
of
october
they
suddenly
realized
that
the
hockey
season
was
beginning
so
far
hockey
and
indeed
any
organized
games
had
been
only
very
languidly
pursued
at
silverside
the
smallness
of
the
school
had
not
given
a
wide
choice
of
champions
and
for
some
years
the
elder
girls
had
been
more
interested
in
botany
and
butterfly
collecting
than
in
sports
silverside
had
had
a
hockey
team
and
had
occasionally
played
a
match
though
it
could
not
pride
itself
on
its
record
of
goals
the
present
prefects
had
never
distinguished
themselves
remarkably
at
athletics
but
they
were
sufficiently
enthusiastic
to
wish
the
school
to
win
successes
they
called
a
boarders
meeting
to
discuss
matters
we
ought
to
have
a
splendid
games
club
this
term
smiled
adah
complacently
there
should
be
several
sets
of
hockey
going
on
in
the
same
afternoon
there
is
room
in
the
field
for
more
than
one
ventured
laura
talbot
then
we
must
take
a
larger
field
decreed
consie
with
so
many
new
subscriptions
we
can
easily
afford
it
girls
instead
of
only
in
a
school
make
a
difference
admitted
irma
ridley
the
treasurer
will
have
quite
a
nice
little
sum
in
hand
chuckled
isobel
norris
i
want
the
school
to
begin
and
make
a
name
for
itself
said
adah
i
do
want
to
say
anything
against
jessie
carew
and
maggie
stephens
last
year
but
really
we
all
know
they
were
slackers
silverside
must
buck
up
agreed
the
others
you
laura
and
janet
and
ethelberga
have
the
makings
of
good
players
in
you
murmured
adah
reflectively
and
of
course
consie
and
myself
and
perhaps
joyce
what
about
the
hawthorners
asked
isobel
we
shall
have
to
include
them
of
course
could
get
up
the
teams
without
them
i
afraid
sniggered
minnie
selburn
adah
stared
hard
at
minnie
who
straightened
her
face
and
sat
up
stiffly
in
the
matter
of
hockey
of
course
everybody
in
the
school
whether
day
girl
or
boarder
will
be
invited
to
join
continued
adah
some
of
those
hawthorners
are
jolly
good
ventured
mona
bardsley
they
won
ever
so
many
matches
last
year
i
believe
added
alice
webster
whom
did
they
play
asked
adah
quickly
i
do
know
i
do
said
avelyn
speaking
for
the
first
time
it
was
workington
ladies
college
mirton
high
school
redlands
county
school
and
harlingden
ladies
team
and
they
beat
them
all
except
harlingden
and
that
was
a
draw
adah
was
rapidly
scribbling
some
entries
in
her
notebook
we
challenge
workington
ladies
college
she
announced
i
wanted
us
to
do
it
last
year
but
we
decided
our
team
was
strong
enough
i
write
to
their
secretary
and
make
a
fixture
it
would
be
a
tremendous
triumph
for
silverside
to
beat
workington
they
rather
a
reputation
the
old
school
going
to
forge
ahead
smiled
consie
we
ask
miss
thompson
to
speak
about
hiring
that
larger
field
said
isobel
we
better
secure
it
at
once
in
case
the
farmer
should
let
it
to
anybody
else
next
day
adah
pinned
up
a
notice
announcing
that
hockey
would
begin
on
the
following
saturday
afternoon
and
asking
all
girls
to
sign
their
names
as
members
of
the
games
club
and
to
pay
their
subscriptions
to
the
treasurer
she
watched
the
day
girls
come
and
surge
round
the
notice
board
then
she
ran
upstairs
to
her
form
room
she
considered
that
she
was
performing
her
duties
admirably
as
head
of
the
school
meantime
downstairs
a
ferment
was
going
on
that
would
have
surprised
her
the
grumblings
and
dissatisfaction
increased
till
a
whisper
began
to
circulate
annie
broadside
says
do
sign
or
do
anything
yet
but
let
the
hawthorners
league
meet
on
the
common
this
afternoon
at
pass
this
on
and
all
turn
up
the
boarders
could
not
understand
why
that
afternoon
the
day
girls
scuttled
away
so
promptly
at
four
and
seemed
in
such
a
frantic
hurry
to
get
on
their
boots
and
be
gone
as
a
rule
they
loitered
about
in
an
annoying
fashion
and
were
seldom
clear
of
the
premises
till
four
the
prefects
ventured
the
opinion
that
silverside
rules
were
at
last
beginning
to
be
properly
kept
they
would
have
been
immensely
electrified
if
they
could
have
seen
what
was
really
happening
not
far
from
the
house
was
a
small
common
which
most
of
the
girls
were
bound
to
pass
on
their
way
to
and
from
school
instead
of
going
home
they
trooped
here
there
was
an
old
tree
stump
at
one
side
and
annie
scrambling
to
the
top
of
it
and
holding
on
by
a
branch
made
it
serve
as
an
orator
platform
from
which
to
address
her
audience
which
stood
below
she
first
of
all
looked
round
critically
are
we
all
here
she
began
several
voices
replied
all
who
could
come
some
girls
had
to
catch
trains
and
the
potters
had
music
lessons
and
trissie
marsh
had
to
go
to
the
dentist
but
they
sympathize
they
have
come
if
they
could
i
glad
to
hear
that
continued
annie
i
like
to
know
i
have
your
sympathy
are
we
all
old
hawthorners
yes
yes
and
no
spies
among
us
certainly
not
then
i
can
speak
freely
i
want
to
say
what
i
sure
we
all
think
that
we
perfectly
disgusted
with
the
way
those
boarders
have
been
behaving
they
speak
as
if
the
school
existed
for
them
and
them
alone
some
societies
we
are
allowed
to
join
at
all
and
those
that
we
may
belong
to
are
kept
well
in
their
own
hands
because
they
appoint
themselves
as
presidents
and
secretaries
and
treasurers
and
members
of
committee
we
simply
have
a
look
in
anywhere
now
i
ask
you
is
this
fair
not
at
all
howled
the
girls
we
exactly
in
the
position
of
serfs
and
it
monstrous
what
right
have
those
boarders
to
rule
over
us
none
it
quite
time
we
showed
our
spirit
i
been
wondering
for
a
long
time
how
we
could
checkmate
them
and
now
i
see
my
way
clear
going
to
start
the
hockey
season
yes
who
do
you
think
will
make
all
the
arrangements
and
be
captains
of
the
teams
boarders
or
day
girls
why
boarders
of
course
and
who
are
the
best
players
who
are
going
to
win
the
goals
are
of
course
we
are
everybody
knows
that
but
the
boarders
would
take
all
the
credit
and
talk
about
successes
the
very
idea
makes
me
ill
why
should
we
play
for
why
indeed
we
not
obliged
to
our
saturdays
are
our
own
and
nobody
can
make
us
come
and
play
hockey
if
we
do
want
i
vote
we
just
say
we
wo
join
their
old
games
club
let
start
a
rival
one
of
our
own
yes
yes
oh
do
let
us
we
call
it
old
hawthorners
hockey
club
and
we
hire
our
old
ground
and
wear
our
old
colours
and
play
matches
of
our
own
and
let
those
conceited
silversiders
go
to
jericho
annie
daring
suggestion
met
with
a
chorus
of
applause
the
hawthorners
made
to
feel
unwelcome
in
their
new
school
clung
desperately
to
their
old
traditions
they
had
had
an
excellent
hockey
record
in
past
years
and
felt
confident
that
they
could
raise
a
team
sufficiently
strong
to
challenge
their
former
rivals
to
matches
will
you
elect
gladys
as
secretary
asked
annie
that
all
right
and
maggie
as
treasurer
then
give
in
your
names
and
bring
your
subscriptions
and
i
go
this
very
night
and
see
about
getting
our
old
field
it
belongs
to
gardner
and
my
father
knows
him
quite
well
so
i
sure
we
shall
manage
it
if
not
we
hire
another
field
or
play
on
the
common
declared
the
girls
as
they
crowded
round
gladys
wilks
giving
in
their
names
adah
gartley
had
kept
her
word
and
written
immediately
to
the
secretary
of
workington
ladies
college
who
had
replied
by
return
of
post
arranging
a
match
for
a
date
in
november
she
showed
the
letter
with
much
satisfaction
to
the
boarders
after
breakfast
by
the
by
have
those
day
girls
paid
their
subscriptions
yet
to
the
games
club
she
asked
suddenly
not
one
of
them
answered
isobel
the
blighters
and
hockey
begins
is
it
just
like
day
girls
i
must
talk
to
them
about
it
at
eleven
the
day
girls
were
busy
consuming
packets
of
lunch
when
adah
glass
of
milk
and
piece
of
bread
and
butter
in
hand
strolled
amongst
them
bent
on
her
mission
look
here
you
slackers
know
you
never
paid
your
yet
ca
admit
anybody
to
the
hockey
field
who
has
given
in
her
subscription
that
one
of
the
traditions
of
silverside
is
it
said
annie
broadside
casually
i
ca
see
that
it
concerns
us
you
see
when
you
get
to
the
field
a
nice
little
disappointment
it
will
be
for
you
to
find
you
not
allowed
to
play
annie
took
a
big
bite
of
oatcake
and
gulped
it
suppose
we
do
want
to
play
not
want
to
play
adah
expression
was
one
of
sheer
incredulity
why
should
we
you
boarders
have
taken
up
all
the
other
societies
so
you
may
have
the
hockey
as
well
we
do
want
to
intrude
on
your
privileges
thanks
but
i
say
blustered
adah
you
play
we
got
to
win
matches
and
keep
up
the
credit
of
the
school
keep
it
up
yourselves
put
in
gladys
sarcastically
you
rubbed
it
into
us
hard
enough
that
it
only
you
who
understand
the
school
traditions
and
we
nothing
but
outsiders
but
you
keen
on
hockey
surely
you
want
to
play
adah
was
making
a
desperate
effort
to
curb
her
temper
and
be
conciliatory
certainly
we
do
but
we
going
to
have
a
club
to
ourselves
you
ca
here
we
do
mean
to
try
it
an
hawthorners
club
and
nothing
to
do
with
silverside
but
you
must
you
sha
go
ratting
like
this
exploded
adah
scarlet
with
indignation
do
get
excited
said
annie
politely
there
nothing
to
prevent
us
our
saturdays
are
our
own
and
nobody
can
compel
us
to
come
to
school
and
play
hockey
if
we
do
want
you
miserable
blighters
there
keep
a
civil
tongue
please
i
thought
the
traditions
of
silverside
did
run
to
slang
perhaps
you
like
to
arrange
a
match
with
us
old
hawthorners
versus
boarders
gladys
is
our
secretary
and
will
book
it
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
choked
adah
beating
as
dignified
a
retreat
as
she
could
it
was
certainly
a
terrible
blow
for
the
prefects
they
had
counted
entirely
on
the
strength
of
the
day
girls
in
arranging
teams
to
be
deserted
in
this
fashion
meant
the
ruin
of
the
hockey
season
they
were
aghast
at
the
bad
news
i
wonder
if
miss
thompson
can
refuse
the
larger
field
speculated
joyce
we
certainly
ca
afford
to
hire
it
with
the
subscriptions
we
got
mourned
isobel
and
it
not
the
slightest
use
our
trying
a
match
with
workington
for
we
should
only
get
a
jolly
good
licking
announced
consie
we
want
to
court
disaster
i
shall
write
to
the
secretary
said
adah
bitterly
and
tell
her
we
been
obliged
to
make
other
arrangements
those
day
girls
are
the
absolute
limit
do
you
think
ventured
isobel
that
perhaps
you
been
a
little
if
you
tried
to
conciliate
them
now
conciliate
echoed
adah
scornfully
really
isobel
what
next
if
you
think
i
going
to
truckle
to
day
girls
you
much
mistaken
i
afraid
we
making
a
good
many
mistakes
murmured
isobel
but
too
low
for
her
friend
to
overhear
her
the
three
other
prefects
certainly
laid
the
blame
of
this
occurrence
on
adah
and
considered
that
if
they
had
conducted
the
negotiations
in
her
place
they
would
have
been
able
to
manage
the
refractory
hawthorners
though
they
always
loyally
supported
their
head
girl
they
were
quite
aware
that
her
overbearing
manners
gave
offence
they
sometimes
suffered
from
her
themselves
she
had
so
thoroughly
established
herself
as
leader
however
that
it
was
not
possible
to
break
away
from
her
rule
she
had
been
longer
than
any
other
girl
at
silverside
and
thus
stood
for
the
old
traditions
whether
these
in
the
end
were
going
to
prove
the
best
for
the
school
was
a
matter
that
admitted
of
some
debate
chapter
vi
reprisals
after
learning
the
story
of
the
lyngates
estate
avelyn
interest
in
pamela
reynolds
was
doubled
and
she
cultivated
her
acquaintance
the
two
girls
travelled
together
from
harlingden
on
friday
afternoons
and
arranged
to
meet
on
monday
mornings
to
walk
in
company
to
the
station
though
pamela
was
not
yet
fourteen
she
was
old
for
her
age
her
adventurous
life
in
canada
had
given
her
a
mental
outlook
different
from
that
of
most
english
girls
she
proved
a
lively
and
very
pleasant
companion
watson
to
whom
avelyn
confided
her
friend
story
paid
a
call
upon
reynolds
and
found
her
a
timid
refined
lady
of
gentle
birth
and
breeding
greatly
saddened
with
her
troubles
and
evidently
without
much
initiative
the
cottage
which
had
been
lent
to
her
by
hockheimer
was
in
a
very
situation
it
was
small
inconvenient
and
possessed
many
drawbacks
but
she
had
made
the
pretty
with
books
and
flowers
and
the
little
home
had
a
cultured
air
about
it
reynolds
did
not
seem
to
wish
to
seek
any
society
and
gently
intimated
that
she
feared
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
walk
as
far
as
the
village
and
return
calls
the
poor
woman
has
simply
sat
down
under
her
troubles
said
watson
describing
her
experiences
at
the
family
easy
to
see
that
she
has
no
spirit
if
she
would
take
life
more
pluckily
it
would
be
better
for
herself
and
everybody
i
sorry
for
that
child
to
live
in
that
quiet
spot
with
such
a
depressed
companion
especially
when
by
all
rights
they
ought
to
have
owned
the
hall
it
makes
my
blood
boil
hockheimer
ought
to
have
done
more
for
them
than
this
catch
hockheimer
doing
much
for
anybody
commented
daphne
people
say
he
the
stingiest
landlord
they
grumble
dreadfully
i
think
he
ought
to
have
had
reynolds
and
pamela
to
live
with
him
at
the
hall
oh
pamela
would
have
just
hated
that
put
in
avelyn
she
simply
ca
bear
her
uncle
i
do
blame
her
sniffed
daphne
oh
muvvie
could
we
ask
pamela
to
tea
said
avelyn
it
must
be
so
lonely
for
her
up
there
without
any
brothers
and
sisters
i
believe
she
love
to
come
well
we
give
her
the
chance
at
any
rate
agreed
watson
i
hope
her
mother
wo
be
stupid
and
refuse
to
let
her
come
i
think
better
send
a
formal
invitation
the
note
was
duly
written
and
dispatched
reynolds
appeared
to
need
some
days
to
think
the
matter
over
but
finally
sent
a
formal
acceptance
hooray
triumphed
daphne
i
quite
expected
she
was
going
to
decline
with
thanks
muvvie
how
glad
i
am
that
you
a
nice
sensible
person
and
not
morbid
you
have
been
such
a
trial
to
us
if
you
always
gone
about
with
an
air
of
depressed
resignation
i
had
my
troubles
as
well
as
other
people
said
watson
it
certainly
does
make
them
any
better
to
mourn
over
them
we
got
to
sit
up
and
make
the
best
of
things
as
they
are
say
die
is
a
good
old
motto
i
try
to
be
chirpy
and
cheery
if
i
were
reduced
to
a
wooden
leg
and
a
glass
eye
so
you
would
muvvie
darling
i
believe
you
dance
a
jig
with
a
crutch
but
about
pamela
we
give
her
a
good
time
when
she
comes
poor
child
the
watsons
were
determined
to
make
pamela
thoroughly
welcome
and
they
succeeded
royally
she
was
painfully
shy
for
the
first
ten
minutes
and
answered
all
questions
in
embarrassed
monosyllables
but
after
a
walk
round
the
garden
she
began
to
thaw
by
the
end
of
tea
she
had
waxed
expansive
and
later
on
she
proved
downright
amusing
by
the
time
the
family
in
a
body
escorted
her
home
they
felt
that
they
had
sealed
a
friendship
they
talked
her
over
on
the
way
back
she
sporty
decided
david
decent
as
far
as
girls
go
qualified
anthony
who
at
twelve
did
not
yield
readily
to
feminine
attractions
i
call
her
charming
said
daphne
you
can
see
she
plenty
in
her
not
one
of
those
lackadaisical
people
like
ella
simpson
who
just
put
on
side
it
seems
to
me
a
most
monstrous
thing
that
her
uncle
should
have
been
able
to
take
all
the
property
collared
the
lot
grunted
david
the
old
hun
garside
told
me
that
everybody
said
squire
reynolds
must
have
made
a
later
will
the
butler
and
coachman
remembered
signing
something
but
it
could
be
found
likely
enough
old
hockheimer
suppressed
it
he
be
equal
to
any
dirty
german
trick
suggested
anthony
if
he
has
he
deserves
penal
servitude
i
prefer
shooting
for
him
said
anthony
grimly
the
watsons
liked
pamela
for
herself
but
it
certainly
gave
her
an
added
interest
to
consider
her
the
victim
of
her
uncle
greed
and
injustice
they
thoroughly
detested
hockheimer
since
the
morning
when
he
had
turned
them
out
of
the
wood
they
had
owed
him
a
grudge
and
other
matters
had
accumulated
to
swell
the
account
his
land
unfortunately
adjoined
theirs
i
have
mentioned
before
that
the
little
property
of
walden
was
shaped
like
a
triangle
the
apex
of
which
jutted
into
hockheimer
estate
this
apex
consisted
of
a
piece
of
rather
marshy
rushy
ground
the
brook
divided
at
its
head
and
flowing
round
it
in
two
separate
streams
reunited
making
the
patch
of
meadow
into
an
island
connected
with
the
main
land
by
a
rough
plank
bridge
it
was
of
little
service
from
a
farmer
point
of
view
but
it
was
a
most
picturesque
spot
and
watson
intended
to
turn
it
into
a
water
garden
she
and
daphne
spent
hours
poring
over
barr
catalogues
and
deciding
what
iris
ranunculi
and
other
plants
they
should
send
for
and
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
dam
a
piece
of
the
brook
to
make
a
pool
for
imagine
their
annoyance
when
one
day
they
found
their
cherished
island
in
the
occupation
of
hockheimer
cows
which
had
walked
down
the
stream
from
their
own
field
with
great
difficulty
the
watsons
drove
them
back
and
replaced
the
rather
broken
which
acted
as
barrier
across
the
brook
when
the
same
incident
happened
again
watson
complained
and
requested
hockheimer
to
see
that
his
cows
kept
to
their
own
field
he
replied
by
stating
that
they
had
always
been
accustomed
to
graze
on
the
island
which
was
really
a
territory
not
strictly
included
in
either
property
though
if
the
matter
were
to
be
investigated
it
would
probably
be
found
to
be
included
in
the
lyngates
estate
much
surprised
and
angry
at
such
an
assertion
watson
looked
up
the
plans
of
walden
which
went
with
her
and
found
the
island
most
certainly
represented
as
her
property
she
called
in
the
assistance
of
the
village
joiner
and
caused
a
strong
barrier
to
be
fixed
across
the
stream
at
the
head
of
the
island
sufficient
to
keep
out
cows
and
make
a
landmark
for
the
boundary
of
her
territory
from
that
of
her
acquisitive
neighbour
this
being
done
she
considered
the
matter
settled
and
proceeded
to
plant
her
iris
and
she
anticipated
a
beautiful
show
from
them
in
the
spring
towards
the
end
of
october
daphne
whose
health
had
picked
up
with
country
air
nevertheless
had
to
report
herself
to
the
specialist
who
had
previously
examined
her
and
she
and
her
mother
made
an
expedition
to
london
they
started
on
a
thursday
and
were
to
spend
sunday
with
friends
in
town
returning
home
on
the
following
monday
or
tuesday
avelyn
david
and
anthony
together
with
ethel
the
maid
had
the
establishment
to
themselves
for
the
with
her
permission
avelyn
asked
pamela
to
spend
the
saturday
afternoon
at
walden
the
young
folks
were
determined
to
have
a
thoroughly
happy
time
together
and
instead
of
taking
a
conventional
tea
in
the
they
carried
their
meal
into
the
barn
and
held
a
picnic
feast
sitting
on
blocks
of
wood
with
the
wheelbarrow
for
a
table
and
with
billy
the
dog
meg
the
cat
and
tiny
the
bantam
cock
as
guests
it
rather
a
stunt
being
all
on
our
own
for
once
opined
anthony
feeding
billy
with
crust
regardless
of
the
rationing
order
murmured
avelyn
pouring
out
milk
for
meg
into
her
saucer
i
wish
something
would
happen
said
david
rocking
himself
airily
to
and
fro
on
his
billet
of
wood
something
happen
if
you
not
careful
old
sport
you
topple
over
next
minute
warned
avelyn
what
do
you
want
to
happen
asked
pamela
something
exciting
an
air
raid
or
a
fire
or
a
burglary
something
really
to
give
one
spasms
pamela
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
she
rested
her
head
on
her
hand
and
thought
when
she
spoke
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
doubt
in
her
voice
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
hesitated
i
not
supposed
to
know
only
i
happened
to
overhear
i
do
care
i
tell
he
only
my
uncle
by
marriage
and
i
detest
him
do
you
mean
mr
hockheimer
asked
avelyn
in
a
sudden
flutter
yes
i
wish
i
did
what
about
him
pamela
hesitated
again
then
whispered
he
coming
here
just
at
dusk
with
an
axe
and
a
saw
what
for
the
watsons
had
clustered
round
with
faces
full
of
horrified
expectancy
to
take
down
that
barrier
across
the
stream
he
says
the
island
his
if
the
enemy
had
landed
the
watsons
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
and
indignant
their
opinion
of
hockheimer
had
been
bad
before
but
that
he
should
take
advantage
of
their
mother
absence
to
perform
such
an
abominable
and
utterly
illegal
act
made
their
blood
boil
there
are
two
opinions
about
the
island
declared
david
grimly
hockheimer
will
find
he
not
going
to
get
things
all
his
own
way
what
time
did
he
say
he
was
coming
just
at
dusk
all
right
we
be
ready
for
him
thanks
ever
so
much
for
letting
us
know
i
say
tony
come
into
the
yard
with
me
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
got
a
brain
wave
what
it
about
davie
asked
avelyn
excitedly
i
tell
you
afterwards
out
in
the
yard
the
two
boys
held
a
hasty
confabulation
they
felt
that
they
must
act
quickly
it
was
their
duty
to
protect
their
property
from
this
hun
robber
the
situation
appealed
to
their
boyish
instincts
david
eyes
gleamed
with
a
wrathful
twinkle
anthony
young
fists
were
tightly
clenched
they
laid
a
careful
plan
of
campaign
then
started
off
to
secure
recruits
in
ten
minutes
they
returned
from
the
village
with
three
boy
scouts
to
whom
they
unfolded
their
designs
they
hurried
off
at
once
to
the
island
to
survey
the
scene
of
action
the
barrier
which
watson
had
caused
to
be
erected
across
the
brook
was
constructed
of
two
stout
poles
with
withies
intertwined
the
ends
were
secured
in
the
banks
and
there
was
room
for
the
water
even
in
flood
to
flow
underneath
on
the
walden
side
of
the
stream
were
some
large
which
the
joiners
had
placed
for
their
convenience
when
fixing
the
posts
into
the
overhanging
bank
david
and
anthony
with
their
scout
friends
took
off
boots
and
stockings
and
after
a
considerable
amount
of
shoving
and
splashing
managed
to
move
away
the
small
stones
that
supported
these
boulders
leaving
them
apparently
safe
but
in
reality
only
lightly
balanced
in
the
brook
they
had
barely
finished
when
twilight
began
to
fall
we
clear
out
now
commanded
david
he
may
come
any
minute
and
i
want
him
to
be
hard
at
work
before
we
appear
on
the
scenes
we
catch
him
and
give
him
more
than
he
expects
chuckled
anthony
going
back
to
the
house
the
boys
took
avelyn
into
their
confidence
they
felt
that
it
would
be
mean
to
leave
her
out
of
such
a
thrilling
adventure
if
you
game
to
come
you
can
they
allowed
graciously
it
ought
to
be
a
sporty
job
blossomy
agreed
avelyn
i
would
miss
it
for
worlds
but
what
about
pamela
she
enjoy
it
of
course
but
her
uncle
would
know
given
the
show
away
she
must
hide
behind
the
bushes
and
not
let
him
see
her
it
be
for
pamela
the
alders
and
clumps
of
furze
were
thick
down
by
the
stream
quite
sufficient
to
give
shelter
to
the
little
party
of
seven
that
presently
took
cover
there
they
preserved
strict
military
discipline
not
a
word
was
spoken
all
crouched
silently
watching
and
waiting
the
sun
had
set
and
the
red
glow
faded
from
the
sky
but
there
was
a
young
moon
and
objects
were
clear
david
held
billy
by
the
collar
he
was
a
sporting
dog
and
trained
not
to
bark
though
he
panted
and
his
eyes
bulged
he
did
not
betray
the
whereabouts
of
his
owner
by
even
the
suspicion
of
a
yelp
early
experience
with
a
former
master
addicted
to
poaching
had
taught
him
his
lesson
just
when
the
owls
had
wakened
and
were
beginning
to
hoot
round
the
barns
hockheimer
came
striding
down
his
field
he
was
annoyed
with
watson
for
having
put
the
barrier
across
the
stream
there
had
indeed
been
one
in
the
days
of
the
former
tenant
but
it
had
conveniently
tumbled
into
the
water
leaving
a
pathway
for
his
cows
to
graze
on
the
island
he
believed
that
by
a
little
bluff
and
persistence
he
could
persuade
watson
that
the
island
was
part
of
his
own
property
he
had
small
opinion
of
women
and
considered
that
a
widow
substance
would
be
an
easy
prey
he
had
decided
to
see
to
the
matter
himself
instead
of
bringing
his
bailiff
or
his
keeper
with
him
since
the
war
began
his
men
had
been
apt
to
make
themselves
very
disagreeable
over
trifles
and
it
was
not
worth
having
a
fuss
about
so
small
a
business
he
stood
on
the
top
of
the
crag
and
surveyed
the
barrier
how
to
get
to
it
was
the
first
question
it
was
fixed
just
where
the
stream
ran
in
a
narrow
gully
between
two
high
banks
he
mentally
strafed
the
village
joiner
for
having
placed
it
in
such
an
inaccessible
spot
from
his
own
land
it
was
practically
impossible
to
reach
it
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
go
into
watson
field
he
had
no
scruples
about
trespassing
and
taking
his
axe
he
hacked
down
some
branches
and
cleared
himself
a
way
through
the
hedge
it
was
comparatively
easy
now
to
reach
the
barrier
there
were
obligingly
left
by
the
workmen
which
would
be
of
great
assistance
to
him
saw
and
axe
in
hand
he
advanced
upon
them
quite
unwitting
that
seven
pairs
of
eyes
eight
with
billy
were
watching
his
movements
from
the
shadow
of
the
bushes
the
first
two
stones
were
secure
enough
and
gave
him
confidence
the
third
tottered
a
little
and
he
stepped
hastily
from
it
on
to
the
fourth
only
to
find
that
it
capsized
altogether
and
landed
him
suddenly
on
his
back
in
the
water
the
stream
was
not
deep
enough
to
drown
but
was
quite
sufficient
to
immerse
him
he
splashed
and
floundered
about
and
rose
wrathful
and
spluttering
to
find
five
boy
figures
standing
in
the
field
and
grinning
at
his
discomfiture
dear
me
hockheimer
said
david
with
feigned
commiseration
afraid
you
wet
hockheimer
remarks
being
in
german
were
probably
better
not
translated
he
waded
ashore
and
began
to
wring
the
water
from
his
clothes
may
i
ask
what
you
were
doing
continued
david
blandly
a
job
that
i
mean
to
finish
you
young
rascal
girned
hockheimer
gruffly
excuse
me
but
that
fence
is
my
mother
property
and
if
anybody
interferes
with
it
we
out
here
to
protect
it
and
i
here
to
remove
it
roared
the
german
take
yourselves
off
you
young
chimpanzees
you
forget
it
our
own
field
continued
david
with
icy
politeness
it
we
who
must
ask
you
to
take
yourself
off
oh
very
well
as
the
german
made
a
threatening
movement
towards
him
billy
will
you
give
hockheimer
a
hint
to
go
billy
had
been
straining
at
his
collar
to
suffocation
point
now
released
and
encouraged
by
his
master
he
flew
barking
furiously
at
the
intruder
and
seized
him
by
the
leg
of
his
wet
trouser
hockheimer
yelled
freed
himself
by
a
kick
and
turning
to
see
the
angry
dog
ready
to
spring
at
him
again
saved
himself
by
suddenly
climbing
up
an
old
willow
stump
that
overhung
the
brook
he
swarmed
up
with
an
agility
surprising
in
a
man
of
his
stout
build
wet
and
draggled
from
his
dip
in
the
stream
he
cut
a
sorry
figure
clinging
among
the
branches
while
billy
mad
with
rage
jumped
and
yelped
down
below
call
off
that
brute
shouted
the
german
hoarsely
there
no
hurry
answered
david
i
want
to
talk
to
you
a
little
hockheimer
it
a
good
opportunity
while
you
resting
call
him
off
and
let
me
go
you
little
villain
if
you
trespass
in
our
field
you
must
expect
the
dog
to
get
excited
it
says
in
the
commination
service
is
he
that
removeth
his
neighbour
landmark
perhaps
you
do
go
to
church
on
ash
wednesdays
now
you
were
distinctly
trying
to
remove
my
landmark
and
if
i
let
you
go
i
may
be
compounding
a
felony
i
got
some
witnesses
here
at
any
rate
what
a
gap
you
made
in
the
fence
we
shall
have
to
make
that
up
tony
old
chap
keep
guard
for
a
while
right
you
are
answered
anthony
sturdily
percy
houghton
had
brought
his
father
and
a
billhook
so
leaving
anthony
as
sentry
by
the
tree
david
with
the
aid
of
the
boys
repaired
the
hedge
he
whistled
cheerily
the
while
hockheimer
was
feeling
far
from
cheerful
he
was
wet
cold
and
in
a
most
undignified
position
every
time
he
ventured
to
let
his
leg
down
so
much
as
an
inch
the
dog
showed
all
his
teeth
in
an
ugly
snarl
the
prospect
of
spending
a
much
longer
time
perched
in
the
tree
was
not
pleasing
he
judged
it
wiser
to
arrange
terms
come
come
you
had
your
little
joke
he
expostulated
in
a
milder
tone
call
your
dog
away
and
i
will
go
home
will
you
give
me
your
solemn
undertaking
not
to
trespass
on
our
property
again
or
attempt
to
remove
our
landmarks
demanded
david
grandly
his
victim
grunted
something
which
might
be
interpreted
as
assent
then
we
let
you
off
this
time
tony
hold
billy
shall
i
help
you
down
hockheimer
you
rather
stiff
i
expect
i
can
manage
myself
growled
the
german
sulkily
as
he
descended
with
a
thud
we
made
up
the
fence
so
we
shall
have
to
let
you
out
through
our
yard
observed
david
by
the
by
you
dropped
a
saw
and
an
axe
into
the
brook
i
fish
them
out
by
daylight
and
throw
them
over
into
your
field
i
call
that
christian
charity
i
might
have
commandeered
them
or
let
them
stop
in
the
stream
and
rust
away
dear
me
wet
i
hope
you
wo
catch
cold
hockheimer
made
no
reply
but
stumped
after
the
boys
up
the
field
and
through
the
david
held
the
gate
open
for
him
most
courteously
and
he
passed
through
into
the
road
then
he
turned
and
shook
his
fist
you
shall
pay
for
this
some
day
he
muttered
i
do
forget
neither
do
i
returned
david
mr
hockheimer
as
the
boys
came
back
round
the
side
of
the
barn
they
met
avelyn
and
pamela
who
had
run
up
from
the
field
the
two
girls
had
kept
hidden
among
the
bushes
but
had
seen
and
heard
most
of
what
was
going
on
you
do
think
he
saw
me
asked
pamela
i
believe
he
kill
me
if
he
knew
i
told
i
do
believe
he
could
possibly
see
you
not
even
from
up
in
the
tree
it
was
getting
so
dark
david
assured
her
he
has
an
awful
temper
shivered
pamela
oh
dave
you
did
bait
him
said
avelyn
with
a
chuckle
i
did
know
you
could
be
so
sarcastic
i
nearly
died
trying
not
to
laugh
out
loud
how
did
you
think
of
it
all
it
came
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
admitted
david
modestly
rather
an
idea
i
like
to
be
a
barrister
when
i
grow
up
if
the
over
i
like
to
be
a
detective
and
snap
the
handcuffs
on
criminals
declared
tony
giving
billy
his
last
as
a
reward
of
virtue
chapter
vii
miss
hopkins
though
avelyn
as
a
weekly
boarder
was
not
quite
in
the
innermost
heart
of
the
silverside
clique
she
was
nevertheless
considered
one
of
the
elect
her
rubbed
it
into
her
that
she
a
boarder
and
as
such
must
be
very
thankful
for
her
privileges
on
the
whole
they
treated
her
rather
well
they
included
her
as
much
as
they
could
in
what
fun
was
going
on
helped
her
to
plait
her
hair
showed
her
their
private
treasures
and
shared
their
occasional
boxes
of
chocolate
impartially
round
the
dormitory
avelyn
felt
that
she
was
living
two
lives
one
began
at
nine
on
monday
morning
and
lasted
till
four
on
friday
and
the
other
occupied
the
intervening
time
each
circled
independently
in
its
own
orbit
the
school
life
was
quite
fascinating
and
absorbing
especially
now
she
was
getting
used
to
it
it
was
jolly
to
sit
on
the
beds
in
the
dormitory
and
compare
experiences
with
the
other
girls
they
generally
had
something
interesting
to
talk
about
especially
irma
ridley
irma
had
an
inventive
mind
and
a
keen
appetite
for
romance
she
read
every
novel
she
could
get
hold
of
though
only
a
very
few
and
those
of
a
strictly
classical
character
were
allowed
in
the
silverside
library
she
had
a
good
memory
was
an
excellent
raconteuse
and
would
sit
in
the
gloaming
and
tell
thrilling
tales
to
anybody
who
was
prepared
to
listen
to
her
she
supplied
the
place
of
a
monthly
magazine
of
fiction
it
was
irma
who
first
started
the
rumour
about
miss
hopkins
the
girls
were
dressing
for
supper
when
she
made
her
amazing
statement
do
you
know
she
remarked
pausing
with
her
hairbrush
in
her
hand
i
verily
believe
that
hopscotch
either
already
is
or
is
just
about
to
be
engaged
if
cupid
himself
had
darted
in
through
the
window
bow
and
arrows
in
hand
the
occupants
of
the
cowslip
room
could
not
have
been
more
electrified
what
hopscotch
you
ragging
it
the
limit
miss
hopkins
the
mathematics
mistress
had
never
struck
the
school
as
a
likely
subject
for
romance
she
was
nippy
determined
brusque
and
a
disciplinarian
there
was
a
slight
burr
in
her
speech
acquired
north
of
the
tweed
and
she
had
a
habit
of
saying
come
come
girrls
she
had
never
yet
been
seen
without
her
and
it
was
a
tradition
that
she
slept
in
them
in
the
minds
of
her
pupils
she
was
indissolubly
intertwined
with
decimals
equations
and
problems
of
geometry
they
connected
her
with
triangles
not
hearts
though
of
course
there
was
no
telling
where
the
little
blind
god
might
suddenly
elect
to
shoot
i
not
ragging
declared
irma
earnestly
i
tell
you
i
really
mean
it
what
more
i
seen
him
when
where
irma
enjoyed
an
audience
she
sat
down
on
janet
bed
with
the
pleasant
consciousness
that
she
had
gripped
her
listeners
i
went
into
the
study
this
afternoon
to
fetch
miss
and
i
found
hopscotch
there
alone
with
a
gentleman
afraid
i
surprised
them
did
they
look
embarrassed
well
they
both
stopped
talking
and
stared
at
me
while
i
hunted
about
for
the
pen
felt
embarrassed
what
he
like
with
a
moustache
that
growing
grey
not
on
the
whole
it
would
be
very
suitable
decided
the
others
they
were
trying
to
readjust
their
mental
attitude
towards
miss
hopkins
and
transfer
her
from
the
mathematical
plane
to
the
sentimental
to
do
so
required
a
wrench
but
it
was
decidedly
thrilling
they
all
suddenly
began
to
remember
symptoms
of
incipient
romance
on
the
part
of
the
mistress
she
wears
a
locket
on
her
it
probably
got
his
photo
inside
decided
ethelberga
and
she
always
snatches
up
her
letters
in
a
frantic
hurry
added
janet
sagely
has
she
known
him
long
asked
avelyn
irma
nodded
doubtfully
i
should
think
it
probably
quite
an
old
affair
they
may
have
been
boy
and
girl
together
perhaps
they
been
separated
for
years
and
years
and
have
only
just
cleared
up
their
misunderstandings
suggested
laura
was
he
holding
her
hand
asked
janet
n
no
i
ca
say
he
was
holding
her
hand
but
then
you
see
knocked
at
the
door
first
and
she
said
in
that
would
give
them
time
agreed
janet
a
silence
followed
and
the
girls
looked
pensively
at
one
another
the
atmosphere
seemed
charged
with
romance
the
ringing
of
the
first
bell
for
supper
brought
them
back
with
a
disagreeable
thud
to
reality
they
had
not
yet
changed
their
dresses
and
a
wild
scramble
ensued
whether
a
mistress
in
the
bonds
of
cupid
would
overlook
such
details
as
unpunctuality
was
an
experiment
too
risky
to
be
tried
they
passed
on
their
information
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
by
next
morning
even
the
day
girls
had
digested
the
news
miss
hopkins
could
not
understand
the
changed
attitude
which
the
school
suddenly
adopted
towards
her
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
something
inexplicable
the
girls
gazed
at
her
in
form
with
a
kind
of
tender
interest
if
she
toyed
with
the
locket
on
her
they
visibly
thrilled
once
when
she
dropped
a
letter
from
her
pocket
irma
who
picked
it
up
actually
blushed
as
she
handed
it
back
when
the
twelve
gates
of
jerusalem
were
mentioned
in
the
scripture
lesson
laura
talbot
asked
whether
a
jasper
stone
was
ever
used
as
an
engagement
ring
in
hebrew
times
being
a
practical
sensible
sort
of
person
miss
hopkins
decided
that
the
war
that
national
bond
of
union
was
bringing
her
into
closer
touch
with
her
pupils
the
girls
meanwhile
were
discussing
a
possible
wedding
present
and
wondering
who
would
be
her
successor
as
mathematical
mistress
several
of
them
were
already
beginning
to
work
little
souvenirs
for
her
they
hustled
them
out
of
the
way
in
a
hurry
if
she
chanced
to
come
into
the
room
for
at
least
a
fortnight
nothing
happened
and
speculations
were
rife
why
does
she
wear
an
engagement
ring
asked
mona
bardsley
does
want
to
publish
it
yet
i
suppose
opined
minnie
selburn
do
you
think
she
be
leaving
at
christmas
one
can
never
tell
has
tommiekins
said
anything
not
a
word
one
thursday
afternoon
an
event
happened
irma
looking
out
at
the
window
watched
a
masculine
form
walk
up
the
drive
and
ring
the
bell
she
instantly
identified
him
with
the
stranger
whom
she
had
seen
in
the
study
with
miss
hopkins
i
knew
him
again
in
a
moment
she
assured
the
others
i
never
forget
faces
and
his
was
unmistakable
the
flutter
among
the
boarders
was
immense
it
was
known
that
miss
hopkins
was
in
the
study
interviewing
the
gentleman
little
daisy
garratt
had
been
in
the
room
reworking
a
returned
sum
when
the
maid
had
entered
and
announced
judson
is
in
the
study
please
m
and
miss
hopkins
had
risen
immediately
from
her
desk
and
told
daisy
she
might
go
an
opportunity
of
which
that
junior
had
instantly
availed
herself
so
his
name
was
judson
it
was
not
highly
romantic
indeed
it
suggested
gold
paint
but
after
all
what
in
a
name
everybody
decided
at
once
that
he
had
brought
the
engagement
ring
and
that
miss
hopkins
blushing
and
conscious
would
wear
it
upon
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
at
they
began
to
search
about
for
suitable
speeches
of
congratulation
several
daring
spirits
heedless
of
conduct
marks
hung
about
the
hall
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
judson
as
he
said
there
was
competition
for
front
places
at
the
windows
that
overlooked
the
steps
twenty
interested
pairs
of
eyes
watched
his
disappear
down
the
drive
there
was
much
speculation
as
to
why
he
had
not
stayed
longer
and
what
he
was
carrying
inside
his
little
black
bag
when
miss
hopkins
came
in
to
tea
an
electric
wave
of
excitement
surged
round
the
room
then
broke
in
disappointment
her
left
hand
was
ringless
she
seated
herself
in
the
most
manner
and
began
to
eat
bread
and
butter
and
talk
about
the
last
air
raid
in
london
before
preparation
it
had
all
leaked
out
judson
was
traveller
for
a
large
firm
of
scholastic
publishers
and
on
both
occasions
he
had
called
to
interview
miss
hopkins
about
some
new
arithmetic
books
she
had
decided
that
they
were
suitable
and
had
ordered
copies
for
the
fifth
and
sixth
forms
that
was
the
whole
of
the
business
in
the
minds
of
the
boarders
cupid
flew
out
of
the
window
with
a
bang
he
left
blank
desolation
behind
were
there
only
arithmetic
books
inside
that
little
black
bag
asked
mona
disgustedly
it
too
sickening
when
i
nearly
finished
my
cover
broke
out
minnie
selburn
mine
was
to
be
a
nightdress
case
lamented
alice
webster
the
inmates
of
the
cowslip
room
as
originators
of
the
whole
romance
felt
particularly
flat
in
disconsolate
spirits
they
went
to
bed
it
was
not
nice
to
be
told
by
adah
gartley
that
they
were
silly
geese
whose
heads
were
filled
with
a
pack
of
sentimental
rubbish
their
injured
feelings
seethed
rallied
and
finally
bubbled
up
there
something
disagreeable
about
adah
remarked
janet
tartly
it
is
only
adah
it
joyce
and
consie
corrected
laura
they
deserve
something
for
their
nastiness
ventured
ethelberga
something
strong
agreed
avelyn
irma
half
undressed
paused
in
the
act
of
pulling
off
her
stockings
and
made
the
important
suggestion
i
say
let
play
a
trick
on
the
prefects
what
a
blossomy
idea
they
richly
deserve
it
it
would
be
just
what
could
we
do
ah
that
just
the
question
my
good
child
said
laura
putting
a
thoughtful
finger
to
her
forehead
there
an
art
in
ragging
it
ought
to
be
done
delicately
we
do
want
clumsy
tricks
such
as
beds
as
for
booby
traps
they
vulgar
and
dangerous
i
would
soil
my
fingers
with
making
one
it
must
be
something
that
will
annoy
them
but
not
harm
them
or
anybody
else
i
have
got
a
brain
wave
yet
but
perhaps
ideas
may
come
suppose
we
go
and
reconnoitre
proposed
avelyn
a
very
jinky
notion
we
might
get
an
idea
on
the
spot
the
four
prefects
slept
in
the
violet
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
they
were
allowed
to
sit
up
later
than
the
rest
of
the
school
and
at
this
moment
were
downstairs
finishing
some
preparation
it
was
an
easy
matter
therefore
to
visit
their
quarters
laura
irma
janet
ethelberga
and
avelyn
made
a
dash
down
the
passage
turned
up
the
gas
and
began
an
inspection
the
violet
room
was
quite
the
prettiest
of
the
dormitories
it
was
also
the
largest
and
had
a
round
table
and
four
easy
chairs
with
comfortable
cushions
the
table
was
spread
with
a
white
cloth
on
which
were
set
forth
four
cups
and
saucers
a
tin
of
cocoa
a
small
basin
of
sugar
and
a
plate
of
biscuits
the
prefects
were
working
overtime
for
an
examination
and
were
allowed
this
special
indulgence
to
refresh
their
tired
brains
before
they
went
to
bed
they
boiled
a
tin
kettle
on
a
gas
ring
and
brought
it
upstairs
with
them
they
considered
their
nightly
cocoa
party
one
of
their
greatest
privileges
looks
jolly
comfortable
sniffed
avelyn
regarding
the
preparations
with
envy
it
well
to
be
a
prefect
agreed
janet
shall
we
eat
the
biscuits
suggested
irma
certainly
not
replied
ethelberga
laura
had
taken
up
the
cocoa
tin
and
was
plunged
in
thought
i
got
it
she
announced
suddenly
i
do
mean
the
tin
but
an
idea
wait
half
a
second
for
me
she
dashed
back
to
the
cowslip
room
and
was
away
several
minutes
when
she
returned
her
face
beamed
triumph
they
wo
enjoy
their
cocoa
she
chuckled
i
mixed
two
teaspoonfuls
of
gregory
powder
with
it
it
will
be
a
nice
little
surprise
for
them
wo
it
sophonisba
i
should
rather
think
so
i
say
let
turn
down
the
gas
and
scoot
we
shall
have
miss
kennedy
coming
along
in
a
minute
the
prefects
came
upstairs
at
ten
carrying
their
kettle
they
retired
into
their
dormitory
and
shut
the
door
two
scouts
from
the
cowslip
room
arrayed
in
and
bedroom
slippers
presently
tiptoed
down
the
passage
and
listened
outside
the
door
was
thick
and
denied
them
the
full
benefit
of
the
conversation
but
they
caught
such
words
as
cheek
disgusting
and
abominable
so
retreated
satisfied
they
expected
a
storm
next
morning
but
rather
to
their
surprise
the
prefects
took
no
notice
of
the
matter
adah
had
decided
that
it
would
be
undignified
to
make
a
fuss
it
will
fall
flat
if
we
say
nothing
she
urged
we
just
jolly
well
lock
up
our
cocoa
tin

future

chapter
viii
jack
if
david
watson
had
not
been
notoriously
careless
and
forgetful
the
events
which
will
be
narrated
in
this
chapter
might
never
have
happened
he
was
a
bright
boy
and
well
on
in
his
form
but
he
had
occasional
lapses
of
memory
in
one
of
these
he
left
his
latin
dictionary
in
the
train
now
if
you
are
on
the
classical
side
of
a
large
school
it
is
not
only
a
difficult
but
an
impossible
matter
to
get
along
without
a
latin
dictionary
of
your
own
to
attempt
to
prepare
your
work
by
borrowing
your
neighbour
book
is
like
essaying
to
live
on
charity
david
realized
this
point
immediately
and
instead
of
proceeding
home
as
usual
by
the
train
he
turned
into
the
town
instead
there
was
a
in
the
market
which
he
thought
might
be
worth
a
visit
it
had
been
recommended
to
him
by
one
of
the
other
boys
who
guaranteed
the
cheapness
of
its
goods
anthony
who
stuck
to
david
like
a
jonathan
went
to
help
him
to
look
i
just
eighteen
pence
in
my
pocket
admitted
david
but
i
may
get
one
at
that
it
need
be
a
particularly
spanky
one
miller
got
a
ripping
atlas
last
week
for
one
and
two
he
showed
it
to
me
it
only
had
norway
and
sweden
lost
out
and
a
few
of
the
maps
blotted
i
can
lend
you
threepence
said
tony
and
you
could
leave
your
watch
or
your
penknife
or
something
i
suppose
the
market
was
a
large
covered
hall
containing
rows
of
stalls
of
all
kinds
the
boys
heroically
resisted
the
attractions
of
oranges
chestnuts
and
sweets
and
made
for
the
books
a
pile
of
these
all
jumbled
together
were
marked
bargains
educational
each
david
and
anthony
began
to
turn
them
over
and
look
at
them
they
were
certainly
an
assorted
lot
there
were
ancient
geographies
and
grammars
dating
back
fifty
or
sixty
years
catechisms
of
scripture
or
history
guides
to
knowledge
botanical
questions
and
even
an
odd
volume
or
two
of
sermons
a
few
of
them
were
older
still
and
had
long
s
and
calf
bindings
regarded
as
educational
ammunition
they
were
as
antiquated
as
pistols
the
boys
rummaged
among
them
for
some
time
in
vain
but
at
last
almost
from
the
bottom
of
the
pile
they
disinterred
a
fairly
respectable
latin
dictionary
it
had
lost
its
back
cover
and
its
title
page
but
otherwise
it
seemed
intact
and
clean
david
took
it
to
the
old
man
who
presided
over
the
stall
and
tendered
him
a
shilling
he
accepted
it
with
reluctance
did
know
i
let
this
slip
in
among
the
bargains
he
grumbled
it
worth
two
and
six
if
it
worth
a
penny
it
came
with
a
lot
of
other
books
from
a
good
house
well
i
suppose
as
it
was
among
the
shillings
you
have
to
have
it
you
may
thank
your
luck
i
made
a
mistake
a
bargain
a
bargain
said
david
as
he
put
the
volume
into
his
satchel
trains
to
netherton
were
not
very
frequent
and
the
boys
had
to
wait
some
time
at
the
station
they
sat
down
on
one
of
the
seats
and
david
opened
his
satchel
and
took
out
the
latin
dictionary
he
agreed
with
the
old
man
that
he
had
got
it
cheap
and
felt
decidedly
satisfied
with
his
purchase
as
he
turned
over
the
leaves
a
letter
fell
out
on
to
the
platform
anthony
picked
it
up
it
was
a
square
envelope
sealed
with
red
wax
and
addressed
to
my
son
leonard
hallo
said
tony
we
got
hold
of
some
chap
letter
here
great
judkins
so
we
have
whom
did
the
book
belong
to
david
turned
to
the
cover
and
there
in
rather
faded
ink
he
found
written
george
reynolds
parkhurst
academy
january
he
gave
a
whistle
here
a
bit
of
stunt
he
said
should
mind
guessing
it
belonged
to
old
squire
reynolds
pamela
grandfather
you
bet
was
his
name
so
ave
said
and
pam
father
name
was
leonard
then
the
letter
was
for
him
i
suppose
it
was
only
he
dead
what
you
do
with
it
then
give
it
to
pamela
what
do
you
think
inside
it
do
i
wish
i
knew
suppose
it
a
will
exactly
my
brain
wave
would
it
be
priceless
if
it
left
everything
to
pamela
and
turned
old
hockheimer
out
of
the
hall
rather
one
never
knows
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
give
it
to
pam
morning
the
watson
boys
sometimes
overtook
pamela
on
the
road
to
the
station
and
every
day
they
travelled
by
the
same
train
to
harlingden
they
made
a
point
of
meeting
her
next
morning
and
david
handed
her
the
envelope
explaining
how
it
came
into
his
possession
i
suppose
you
could
open
it
and
see
what
inside
suggested
anthony
pamela
looked
doubtfully
at
the
seal
i
think
i
ought
to
give
it
to
mother
she
said
i
expect
she
show
it
to
me
do
let
that
precious
uncle
of
yours
get
hold
of
it
that
all
warned
david
no
indeed
i
be
careful
you
tell
us
what
it
about
wo
you
begged
tony
the
curious
if
mother
will
let
me
some
day
perhaps
you
be
mistress
of
lyngates
hall
no
such
luck
declared
pamela
bitterly
though
she
might
disclaim
any
expectation
of
good
fortune
the
remembrance
of
the
letter
nevertheless
haunted
pamela
all
day
long
she
kept
feeling
in
her
pocket
to
see
that
it
was
safe
in
spite
of
herself
bright
fairy
dreams
floated
through
her
mind
and
mixed
themselves
up
with
her
lessons
miss
peters
had
to
tell
her
twice
to
pay
attention
she
missed
the
explanation
of
a
problem
while
she
imagined
herself
living
at
the
hall
and
riding
a
white
pony
and
got
utterly
wrong
in
geology
through
planning
how
her
mother
should
go
up
to
london
and
buy
new
clothes
dream
castles
are
the
most
delightful
of
possessions
we
build
them
according
to
our
own
pattern
and
live
in
them
as
our
fancy
pleases
us
those
more
sober
dwellings
that
fate
sends
us
are
never
half
so
beautiful
though
we
generally
have
to
put
up
with
them
the
day
seemed
longer
than
usual
to
pamela
she
hurried
off
at
four
though
her
train
did
not
start
till
and
she
only
had
to
wait
at
the
station
she
did
not
happen
to
see
the
watson
boys
for
they
ran
up
so
late
that
they
had
to
jump
into
the
guard
van
and
at
netherton
they
went
into
the
booking
office
to
enquire
about
a
lost
parcel
pamela
walked
home
at
a
good
pace
though
the
road
was
all
uphill
moss
cottage
the
little
place
which
had
been
lent
by
hockheimer
to
reynolds
was
not
a
particularly
attractive
residence
it
was
rather
dark
and
damp
and
much
shaded
by
trees
it
had
no
beautiful
view
such
as
there
was
at
walden
its
front
windows
faced
the
road
and
the
light
was
obstructed
by
a
large
poor
reynolds
had
made
everything
look
as
nice
as
she
could
and
was
busying
herself
in
trying
to
get
the
neglected
garden
back
into
a
state
of
cultivation
she
was
burning
weeds
when
her
daughter
arrived
pamela
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
where
the
table
was
ready
spread
for
tea
she
took
the
precious
letter
from
her
pocket
and
smiling
with
pleasant
anticipation
put
it
upon
her
mother
plate
she
would
tell
her
all
about
it
at
over
the
bread
and
jam
smelling
the
burning
weeds
she
ran
into
the
garden
reynolds
paused
in
her
occupation
of
forking
fresh
fuel
on
to
the
bonfire
is
that
you
child
then
i
go
in
and
make
the
tea
how
the
evenings
are
closing
in
it
will
soon
be
dark
when
you
get
home
i
wish
you
could
be
a
weekly
boarder
at
school
like
avelyn
watson
i
do
i
far
rather
come
back
to
you
every
evening
mummie
i
ca
let
you
walk
back
from
the
station
alone
in
the
dark
i
shall
soon
have
to
begin
to
come
and
meet
you
in
the
afternoons
oh
mummie
it
too
far
for
you
i
do
in
the
least
mind
walking
alone
shall
i
go
and
shut
up
the
fowls
now
or
have
you
done
it
not
yet
so
you
may
run
and
shut
them
up
while
i
make
the
tea
you
find
a
big
surprise
on
the
table
mummie
darling
do
touch
it
till
i
come
will
you
i
tell
you
all
about
it
at
tea
very
well
smiled
reynolds
who
was
used
to
pamela
little
surprises
she
was
in
the
act
of
pouring
on
the
boiling
water
when
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
and
her
entered
hockheimer
generally
admitted
himself
in
this
fashion
without
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
answered
a
lack
of
courtesy
which
invariably
annoyed
reynolds
i
was
passing
so
i
came
for
that
parcel
i
left
the
other
day
he
explained
you
put
it
by
in
the
cupboard
did
you
yes
there
it
is
i
take
it
with
me
by
the
by
have
you
any
paraffin
to
spare
i
happen
to
want
a
little
i
have
some
in
the
shed
outside
can
you
give
me
some
in
a
bottle
yes
i
go
and
fetch
it
reynolds
placed
the
teapot
to
keep
hot
on
the
hob
and
left
the
room
hockheimer
came
over
to
the
fire
and
stood
warming
his
back
and
humming
snatches
from
an
opera
presently
his
eye
caught
the
letter
on
the
table
he
picked
it
up
looked
narrowly
at
the
handwriting
turned
it
over
and
examined
the
seal
then
he
thought
for
a
moment
with
narrowed
eyes
finally
he
slipped
the
envelope
into
his
breast
pocket
and
catching
up
his
parcel
made
his
way
outside
to
the
shed
is
that
bottle
of
paraffin
ready
he
shouted
i
in
a
hurry
and
ca
stay
it
here
i
was
just
looking
for
a
piece
of
paper
to
wrap
it
in
replied
reynolds
wo
you
stop
for
tea
have
the
time
never
mind
any
paper
i
do
want
to
wait
the
bottle
will
do
well
enough
in
my
pocket
i
must
be
off
now
returned
his
rather
relieved
at
the
shortness
of
his
visit
she
washed
her
hands
after
pouring
out
the
paraffin
and
came
into
the
pamela
who
had
been
tidying
herself
upstairs
entering
at
the
same
moment
i
glad
we
got
rid
of
uncle
smiled
the
latter
i
heard
his
voice
and
kept
out
of
the
way
naughty
child
well
mummie
i
ca
help
it
you
know
i
do
like
him
i
do
care
if
we
are
dependent
on
him
what
i
feel
is
that
we
ought
to
be
there
i
wo
upset
you
by
talking
of
him
i
something
else
i
want
to
tell
you
why
where
the
letter
what
letter
the
letter
that
i
put
on
your
plate
mummie
what
have
you
done
with
it
there
was
an
agony
of
apprehension
in
pamela
voice
i
have
seen
it
dear
replied
reynolds
why
yes
i
remember
now
i
did
notice
a
letter
lying
on
the
plate
when
i
was
making
the
tea
i
was
just
going
to
look
at
it
when
your
uncle
came
in
it
certainly
not
there
now
two
red
spots
mounted
to
pamela
cheeks
and
her
eyes
blazed
sparks
this
is
just
about
the
limit
she
exploded
there
not
the
least
shadow
of
a
doubt
uncle
fritz
has
stolen
that
letter
while
these
events
were
taking
place
at
moss
cottage
david
and
anthony
watson
were
walking
home
from
the
station
they
had
lingered
at
the
booking
office
and
had
loitered
on
the
platform
to
talk
to
some
friends
and
when
they
finally
made
a
start
they
determined
to
take
a
path
through
the
woods
instead
of
keeping
to
the
high
road
there
were
two
motives
for
this
decision
in
the
first
place
the
woods
belonged
to
the
lyngates
estate
and
though
the
public
had
an
right
of
way
hockheimer
objected
greatly
to
the
being
used
and
had
several
times
vainly
tried
to
close
it
the
boys
felt
that
they
would
cheerfully
go
out
of
their
way
to
annoy
hockheimer
they
almost
hoped
they
might
meet
him
and
in
imagination
stood
firmly
on
the
path
discussing
the
legal
aspect
of
the
matter
and
quoting
the
ancient
county
map
as
their
authority
there
was
however
another
reason
which
led
them
from
the
high
road
during
the
last
few
days
a
curious
and
persistent
rumour
had
circulated
in
the
neighbourhood
as
to
a
something
that
had
appeared
in
the
woods
whether
supernatural
or
physical
nobody
knew
but
several
people
vouched
for
having
seen
it
their
stories
allowing
a
natural
margin
for
exaggeration
tallied
wonderfully
the
apparition
wore
dark
clothes
and
a
black
mask
and
instead
of
walking
careered
along
in
a
series
of
mighty
leaps
and
bounds
owing
to
this
extraordinary
mode
of
progression
it
had
been
nicknamed
jack
and
its
appearance
had
excited
considerable
terror
it
was
reported
to
be
abroad
at
dusk
and
to
haunt
the
more
lonely
portions
of
the
woods
david
and
anthony
having
a
thorough
boyish
love
of
adventure
thirsted
to
get
a
sight
of
this
mysterious
personage
they
climbed
the
hill
over
the
quarry
therefore
and
struck
up
through
the
woods
keeping
at
first
to
the
but
they
encountered
nobody
not
even
hockheimer
when
you
are
out
for
excitement
it
is
disappointing
to
have
a
perfectly
tame
and
uneventful
walk
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
wood
they
paused
with
one
consent
it
all
bunkum
about
the
trespassing
let
go
and
explore
tempted
david
right
you
are
agreed
anthony
succumbing
as
readily
as
eve
yielded
to
the
serpent
it
was
a
most
interesting
wood
with
tall
trees
and
smooth
glades
it
undulated
and
held
crags
here
and
there
so
that
you
could
never
quite
see
where
you
were
going
the
ground
was
strewn
with
acorns
and
beech
mast
and
quite
worth
picking
up
the
boys
wandered
for
some
little
time
enjoying
themselves
immensely
they
had
no
idea
in
what
direction
they
were
going
till
they
found
themselves
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
behind
them
was
the
wood
but
in
front
was
a
range
of
open
country
looking
towards
the
sea
they
were
standing
on
a
platform
of
rock
which
shelved
sharply
down
to
a
patch
of
gorse
and
heather
jolly
view
here
began
anthony
but
stopped
with
his
sentence
unfinished
for
david
suddenly
gripped
his
arm
and
forced
him
on
his
knees
behind
a
bush
somebody
was
walking
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
and
one
brief
glimpse
had
been
sufficient
to
identify
the
plump
figure
and
blond
moustache
of
their
hockheimer
it
would
never
do
for
him
to
catch
them
so
far
from
the
he
might
wish
to
settle
up
scores
with
them
they
remembered
the
gleam
in
his
eye
when
he
had
shaken
his
fist
and
said
he
would
not
forget
if
they
waited
quietly
he
would
probably
go
and
then
they
would
hurry
back
to
the
path
but
instead
of
going
he
waited
humming
a
tune
he
was
musical
and
fond
of
operatic
airs
there
were
other
sounds
too
which
the
boys
could
not
understand
they
grew
curious
and
wanted
to
know
what
he
was
doing
they
dared
not
speak
but
agreeing
by
signs
they
both
crawled
very
cautiously
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
concealed
by
some
branches
peeped
over
hockheimer
was
exactly
below
them
he
was
kneeling
on
the
grass
and
had
evidently
just
untied
a
parcel
a
large
bicycle
lamp
lay
on
the
paper
in
his
hand
he
held
a
bottle
with
the
contents
of
which
he
proceeded
to
fill
the
lamp
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
matches
lighted
it
and
placed
it
on
a
ledge
of
the
rock
the
dusk
was
falling
fast
and
its
glow
shone
brightly
from
its
position
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
it
would
be
visible
over
miles
of
country
probably
right
out
to
sea
hockheimer
hummed
in
a
satisfied
voice
as
if
he
were
pleased
with
himself
he
presently
lighted
a
cigar
the
fragrant
smoke
rose
upwards
to
the
boys
nostrils
they
could
see
him
with
extreme
plainness
and
indeed
could
follow
his
every
movement
he
fumbled
again
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
an
envelope
holding
it
in
the
glow
of
the
lamp
so
as
to
inspect
it
david
and
anthony
gasped
for
they
recognized
in
a
moment
the
letter
which
they
had
given
to
pamela
only
that
morning
how
had
she
been
so
foolish
as
to
allow
her
uncle
to
get
hold
of
it
they
asked
themselves
they
were
full
of
wrath
at
her
stupidity
hockheimer
turned
over
the
envelope
several
times
he
looked
at
the
handwriting
and
surveyed
the
seal
then
he
deliberately
tore
it
open
he
drew
out
a
piece
of
and
began
to
read
it
the
boys
peering
through
the
brambles
above
watched
him
narrowly
though
they
could
not
see
the
document
well
enough
to
decipher
it
its
contents
seemed
to
disturb
hockheimer
he
said
several
untranslatable
things
in
the
german
tongue
then
he
brought
out
his
smart
little
silver
box
hesitated
and
struck
a
match
the
boys
were
in
an
agony
of
mind
he
simply
must
not
be
allowed
to
burn
the
paper
sooner
than
that
they
would
drop
from
the
crag
and
try
to
rescue
it
the
wind
had
risen
and
blew
out
the
match
for
a
moment
they
breathed
again
but
it
was
only
a
temporary
respite
for
he
immediately
struck
another
he
shaded
it
carefully
this
time
and
taking
the
paper
applied
the
corner
to
the
flame
at
that
same
moment
a
terrific
and
unearthly
yell
sounded
in
the
wood
above
hockheimer
started
and
turned
dropping
blazing
letter
and
match
to
the
ground
there
was
a
rustle
among
the
bushes
and
with
an
enormous
bound
a
dark
figure
sprang
sheer
from
the
rocks
on
to
the
platform
of
grass
made
a
grab
at
the
paper
seized
it
put
out
the
fire
and
leaped
away
with
it
into
the
gathering
dusk
of
the
undergrowth
below
it
happened
with
such
extraordinary
rapidity
and
suddenness
that
it
was
all
over
in
a
flash
and
the
boys
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
mask
and
two
long
legs
that
hopped
with
the
agility
of
a
considerably
scared
they
crept
back
from
their
position
of
vantage
and
rushing
through
the
darkening
wood
managed
to
regain
the
pathway
it
was
not
till
they
had
finally
crossed
the
stile
and
got
into
the
high
road
that
they
began
to
compare
notes
well
we
seen
it
ejaculated
david
meaningly
what
is
it
whispered
anthony
in
awestruck
tones
teddy
jones
says
it
old
nick
himself
it
was
terrible
when
it
yelled
those
legs
were
human
maintained
david
i
ca
guess
who
it
is
or
how
he
manages
to
jump
like
that
but
i
bet
he
not
a
spook
anthony
who
inclined
to
the
supernatural
theory
of
the
apparition
shook
his
head
doubtfully
spook
or
not
he
no
friend
to
old
hockheimer
added
david
he
taken
the
letter
what
was
left
of
it
only
a
bit
was
burnt
i
wonder
what
was
in
it
something
that
hun
wanted
safely
out
of
the
way
it
must
be
squire
reynolds
will
well
jack
got
it
at
any
rate
and
whether
he
ever
turn
it
up
again
is
the
question
if
we
could
find
out
who
he
is
we
might
get
on
the
track
of
it
we
try
for
pamela
sake
though
she
a
bally
idiot
to
let
her
uncle
take
that
letter
it
strikes
me
we
got
on
the
track
of
something
else
continued
david
did
you
notice
that
lamp
yes
i
did
and
where
he
stuck
it
rather
the
light
would
shine
right
out
to
sea
and
aeroplanes
could
see
it
too
from
there
i
always
suspected
old
hockheimer
he
ought
to
have
been
interned
long
ago
i
ca
think
why
they
let
him
be
at
large
the
very
lax
with
these
germans
if
i
were
in
parliament
i
clear
out
the
whole
set
of
them
anthony
drew
a
long
breath
we
must
watch
him
do
say
too
much
to
pamela
in
case
the
silly
goose
blabs
shall
we
tell
her
what
we
seen
on
the
whole
i
think
we
better
not
she
hates
him
and
yet
perhaps
she
might
not
altogether
want
to
get
him
into
trouble
we
go
cautiously
and
hunt
about
and
see
what
more
we
can
find
out
for
a
few
days
the
boys
purposely
avoided
pamela
and
she
on
her
part
did
not
seek
speech
with
them
she
was
intensely
chagrined
at
the
loss
of
the
letter
and
did
not
like
to
acknowledge
the
humiliating
fact
to
them
she
searched
everywhere
in
the
cottage
in
case
the
wind
might
have
blown
it
from
the
table
on
to
the
floor
but
it
was
not
forthcoming
her
mother
vetoed
the
suggestion
that
hockheimer
had
taken
it
surely
dear
he
would
never
be
so
dishonourable
you
must
have
put
it
somewhere
yourself
but
mummie
i
know
i
did
and
you
said
yourself
that
you
saw
it
on
the
table
it
very
mysterious
sighed
reynolds
we
might
ask
your
uncle
next
time
he
comes
if
he
took
it
by
mistake
he
only
deny
it
pamela
you
misjudge
him
i
hate
him
mummie
he
bullies
us
both
we
entirely
dependent
on
him
remember
he
gives
us
the
whole
of
our
little
income
and
pays
your
school
bills
we
must
quarrel
with
our
bread
and
butter
what
should
we
do
if
he
were
to
turn
us
out
i
do
know
i
sometimes
think
i
rather
be
a
than
take
his
money
oh
life
horrid
and
i
hate
it
all
i
wish
we
stayed
in
canada
and
never
come
to
england
wait
till
i
a
little
older
mummie
and
i
get
a
post
as
teacher
and
work
for
you
i
wish
i
were
that
many
years
off
child
and
in
the
meantime
you
to
get
your
education
you
must
be
civil
to
your
uncle
pamela
i
will
on
the
outside
but
i
ca
help
my
feelings
inside
boiling
demurred
pamela
rather
defiantly
scrubbing
the
corners
of
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
and
settling
down
to
her
lesson
books
chapter
ix
concerns
day
girls
the
silverside
boarders
had
what
might
perhaps
be
termed
rather
genteel
hockey
practices
on
saturday
afternoons
they
played
they
were
not
extremely
keen
and
they
gleefully
put
off
play
in
favour
of
a
walk
or
of
the
cinema
isobel
even
broached
the
suggestion
that
hockey
was
a
rough
game
but
that
was
when
she
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
an
ugly
whack
across
the
shins
and
her
opinion
was
naturally
biased
consie
tastes
were
all
for
quiet
and
she
would
have
spent
her
holidays
over
a
book
if
she
had
not
been
forcibly
dragged
out
joyce
would
have
preferred
a
dancing
class
on
saturday
afternoons
in
the
meanwhile
the
hockey
club
prospered
exceedingly
they
had
secured
their
old
field
and
had
made
fixtures
with
several
other
clubs
their
elation
over
their
successes
did
not
tend
to
promote
the
unity
of
silverside
the
school
seemed
more
divided
than
ever
in
november
came
the
sale
of
work
it
was
an
annual
affair
held
in
aid
of
a
children
home
and
the
silverside
girls
worked
the
whole
year
beforehand
for
it
they
considered
it
a
great
event
people
in
harlingden
were
kind
in
coming
to
buy
and
generally
quite
a
nice
little
sum
was
cleared
as
the
time
drew
near
adah
began
to
make
preparations
will
anyone
who
has
contributions
kindly
bring
them
to
me
by
the
end
of
the
week
she
announced
one
day
at
break
why
should
we
bring
them
to
asked
annie
broadside
with
a
glint
of
battle
in
her
blue
eyes
adah
manner
at
once
stiffened
into
the
peculiar
mixture
of
firmness
and
patronage
which
she
deemed
it
desirable
to
adopt
towards
day
girls
why
what
a
question
to
ask
so
that
they
can
be
put
on
the
stall
of
course
thanks
but
we
rather
arrange
them
for
ourselves
you
ca
do
that
the
boarders
always
arrange
the
bazaar
but
why
when
make
the
things
should
take
them
all
and
arrange
them
they
not
work
annie
certainly
had
a
most
aggravating
habit
of
asking
questions
adah
coloured
with
annoyance
i
a
prefect
you
see
she
shuffled
there
were
no
prefects
last
year
and
you
quote
what
you
always
done
as
your
authority
well
really
the
few
things
the
day
girls
have
brought
have
never
mattered
much
before
i
keep
a
space
for
you
if
you
so
particular
and
you
can
arrange
them
as
you
like
as
long
as
you
spoil
the
general
look
of
the
stall
conceded
adah
with
a
show
of
magnanimity
thanks
much
your
majesty
it
really
most
kind
of
you
to
keep
a
little
room
for
our
poor
contribution
curtsied
annie
with
mock
gratitude
when
the
prefect
back
was
turned
she
fizzed
over
to
a
sympathetic
and
outraged
circle
adah
disdainful
condescension
was
more
than
could
be
brooked
the
boarders
have
always
had
stall
and
the
day
girls
have
humbly
helped
said
gladys
witheringly
how
delightful
for
us
they
to
be
the
patricians
and
we
the
plebeians
they
expect
us
to
dust
their
very
boots
look
here
said
annie
things
are
really
getting
beyond
the
limit
i
vote
we
get
up
a
deputation
and
go
to
miss
thompson
about
this
what
a
brain
wave
miss
thompson
listened
attentive
and
rather
astonished
while
the
deputation
very
shy
and
blurted
out
their
request
she
tapped
her
desk
thoughtfully
with
her
as
if
some
new
and
disturbing
idea
had
suddenly
risen
on
her
horizon
certainly
there
will
be
ample
room
for
two
stalls
and
if
the
day
girls
want
to
have
one
to
themselves
i
can
see
no
objection
arrange
it
just
as
you
like
and
bring
your
own
decorations
yes
you
may
have
a
variety
entertainment
in
one
of
the
schoolrooms
and
charge
admission
if
you
wish
it
will
make
extra
money
you
excuse
our
coming
and
asking
apologized
gladys
i
always
ready
to
hear
you
and
to
make
any
concessions
that
are
for
the
good
of
the
school
replied
miss
thompson
gazing
at
the
delegates
as
if
they
provided
her
with
considerable
food
for
thought
the
deputation
departed
feeling
that
they
had
scored
their
first
real
triumph
look
here
preached
annie
to
the
hawthorners
we
just
got
to
brace
up
the
boarders
may
put
what
they
like
on
their
stall
but
our
stall
is
going
to
be
bigger
and
handsomer
and
have
far
prettier
things
and
take
ever
so
much
more
money
than
theirs
every
single
girl
of
you
has
got
to
do
her
bit
there
must
be
no
slackers
over
this
business
the
motive
if
not
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
best
morality
appealed
to
the
day
girls
they
responded
gallantly
and
set
all
their
working
for
the
bazaar
as
well
as
doing
what
they
could
in
their
own
spare
time
they
kept
their
activities
strictly
secret
from
the
ears
of
the
boarders
but
in
private
they
compared
notes
and
rejoiced
the
new
lady
mayoress
is
to
open
the
sale
announced
gladys
one
day
parker

surely

to
little

parker
she
of
course
she
is
i
going
to
get
hold
of

and
be
decent

nodded
annie
sagely
she
a
sweet
kid
i
see
possibilities
through
violet
by
the
by
can
you
find
me
a
copy
of
the
harlingden
city
arms
it
a
lion
holding
a
broken
chain
i
saw
it
on
a
letter
of
the
other
day
i
can
easily
get
it
for
you
thanks
i
got
a
blossomy
idea
the
day
of
the
bazaar
was
to
be
a
whole
holiday
the
large
schoolroom
was
reserved
for
the
sale
and
the
stalls
were
put
up
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
day
girls
had
elected
a
committee
of
management
and
six
of
their
number
came
to
arrange
their
part
of
the
fancy
fair
they
brought
flags
draperies
flowers
and
pots
of
plants
and
set
to
work
to
decorate
their
stall
in
the
course
of
about
half
an
hour
it
began
to
look
a
most
artistic
production
the
boarders
busy
setting
out
their
wares
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
cast
surreptitious
glances
at
it
it
was
a
humiliating
fact
for
them
but
they
were
forced
to
acknowledge
that
it
far
surpassed
their
own
efforts
they
had
never
thought
of
a
canopy
of
white
and
gold
with
a
border
of
autumn
leaves
or
of
borrowing
maidenhair
ferns
and
forced
roman
hyacinths
but
the
decorations
were
only
the
beginning
of
the
day
girls
triumph
their
committee
soon
began
to
unpack
boxes
and
spread
out
goods
most
beautiful
work
of
every
description
which
left
their
rivals
gasping
the
day
girls
living
at
home
had
really
had
a
much
better
opportunity
of
asking
their
friends
to
help
and
had
made
a
very
special
effort
gertrude
howells
cousin
had
contributed
various
dainty
articles
in
poker
work
lucy
smith
elder
sister
who
was
learning
jewellery
work
at
the
school
of
art
sent
some
most
artistic
little
silver
brooches
and
chains
made
by
her
own
hands
iris
harden
aunt
gave
venetian
beads
and
foreign
curiosities
monica
golding
family
had
plaited
raffia
baskets
in
barbaric
but
most
effective
combinations
of
colour
maggie
stuart
caused
a
sensation
by
producing
little
boxes
of
delicious
toffee
yes
real
toothsome
toffee
in
spite
of
the
sugar
rationing
the
boarders
went
on
with
their
own
preparations
and
pretended
not
to
take
much
notice
but
really
the
spirit
was
knocked
out
of
them
they
had
never
expected
the
day
girls
to
rise
to
such
heights
they
dressed
rather
quietly
for
the
festivities
that
afternoon
the
sale
was
to
open
early
and
at
two
miss
thompson
in
her
best
voile
dress
and
with
her
most
affable
company
manner
was
welcoming
the
lady
mayoress
a
smiling
florid
rather
flurried
personage
in
velvet
and
rich
furs
who
had
another
function
at
three
and
wanted
to
get
away
as
soon
as
was
politely
possible
so
kind
of
you
to
ask
me
she
fluttered
i
really
interested
in
schools
and
education
you
know
i
afraid
i
not
much
of
a
speaker
but
oh
yes
i
just
say
a
few
words
to
open
the
sale
kind
not
at
all
it
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
come
i
assure
you
the
poor
lady
mayoress
was
new
to
her
work
and
palpably
shy
perhaps
she
thought
a
crowd
of
schoolgirls
an
embarrassing
audience
she
hummed
and
hawed
and
stammered
a
little
in
her
speech
and
glanced
several
times
at
a
piece
of
paper
concealed
behind
her
muff
but
she
nevertheless
managed
to
say
something
appropriate
about
the
object
of
the
bazaar
and
to
wish
it
success
i
am
very
pleased
to
declare
the
sale
of
work
open
she
concluded
with
a
sort
of
gasp
as
if
thankful
that
her
duty
was
done
and
smiled
nervously
at
miss
thompson
whose
convex
eyeglasses
had
been
fixed
upon
her
with
appreciation
during
the
speech
perhaps
you
would
like
to
look
at
the
work
now
murmured
the
principal
oh
certainly
i
to
see
it
what
pretty
things
and
the
lady
mayoress
though
she
was
standing
within
two
feet
of
adah
gartley
and
consie
arkwright
actually
turned
her
back
on
the
boarders
and
made
for
the
day
girls
stall
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
central
object
displayed
there
a
satin
cushion
with
the
city
arms
embroidered
upon
it
she
examined
it
with
admiration
so
beautifully
done
and
the
colours
are
so
effective
it
will
just
match
my
i
shall
be
delighted
to
have
it
how
clever
your
girls
are
miss
thompson
i
suppose
these
are
the
prefects
smiling
graciously
at
annie
broadside
and
gladys
wilks
my
little
niece
tells
me
about
the
school
she
so
happy
here
these
are
not
our
prefects
demurred
miss
thompson
they
are
at
the
boarders
stall
perhaps
you
would
like
to
look
at
some
of
their
work
too
oh
with
pleasure
though
i
ca
stay
more
than
a
minute
it
so
tiresome
i
have
another
engagement
and
must
be
late
but
i
time
for
just
a
look
at
any
rate
yes
the
things
are
charming
they
do
the
girls
credit
i
sure
may
i
have
this
tray
cloth
and
this
tea
cosy
i
so
sorry
to
rush
away
but
i
really
must
say
the
lady
mayoress
departed
feeling
no
doubt
that
she
had
successfully
accomplished
a
civic
and
social
duty
and
quite
unaware
of
the
storm
she
had
left
behind
the
boarders
were
staring
at
their
prefects
in
shocked
sympathy
the
whole
business
seemed
almost
incredible
that
they
the
original
silversiders
who
had
always
in
former
years
run
the
sale
of
work
should
be
overlooked
and
passed
over
in
favour
of
mere
upstart
day
girls
was
little
short
of
an
insult
to
the
school
she
never
even
said
do
to
adah
and
she
shook
hands
with
annie
gasped
ethelberga
to
janet
and
she
spent
three
times
as
much
at
their
stall
as
at
ours
it
a
shame
the
boarders
felt
that
the
afternoon
had
opened
badly
and
subsequent
events
did
not
tend
to
soothe
their
outraged
feelings
nearly
all
the
day
girls
had
invited
relations
or
friends
who
naturally
went
first
to
their
stall
to
buy
with
the
result
that
the
pretty
things
soon
began
to
be
cleared
and
the
to
grow
heavy
miss
thompson
anxious
to
preserve
a
due
balance
in
affairs
did
her
best
by
taking
her
own
special
visitors
to
buy
from
the
disconsolate
prefects
and
the
mistresses
also
nobly
purchased
many
totally
undesirable
articles
for
which
they
would
find
no
possible
use
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
help
the
boarders
stall
would
have
had
a
poor
innings
as
it
was
they
barely
scored
of
the
whole
proceeds
of
the
sale
the
principal
in
a
pretty
little
speech
next
morning
at
nine
spoke
of
the
very
gratifying
results
of
the
happy
spirit
of
unity
in
a
school
where
all
worked
together
for
a
good
object
and
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
send
such
a
large
cheque
to
the
children
home
adah
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
bows
of
her
shoes
listened
grimly
it
was
all
nice
enough
she
thought
for
head
mistresses
to
make
soothing
speeches
but
boarders
and
day
girls
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
welding
of
rival
factions
at
silverside
would
not
be
accomplished
yet
a
while
quite
apart
from
the
warring
of
opposite
parties
there
seemed
to
be
an
element
of
unrest
in
the
school
formerly
the
boarders
had
been
quite
content
to
spend
the
leisure
of
their
evenings
at
sewing
games
or
over
some
of
their
numerous
guilds
now
incited
by
the
accounts
of
the
day
girls
they
were
always
asking
to
be
taken
in
to
harlingden
to
concerts
or
picture
palaces
miss
thompson
considered
that
such
expeditions
upset
their
preparation
and
only
allowed
a
very
occasional
outing
it
was
irritating
to
the
boarders
to
hear
the
day
girls
discussing
various
entertainments
and
to
be
openly
pitied
because
they
could
not
attend
them
the
cowslip
room
in
particular
grumbled
privately
we
never
go
to
anything
life
just
a
round
of
lessons
there
the
most
gorgeous
thing
on
at
the
cinema
this
week
i
give
my
ears
to
see
it
it
not
our
turn
this
week
strafe
the
wretched
old
turns
miss
thompson
in
her
efforts
to
avoid
too
much
dissipation
had
established
a
new
rule
by
which
the
dormitories
in
regular
sequence
were
allowed
leave
every
wednesday
afternoon
certain
little
parties
of
boarders
trotted
off
to
the
town
under
escort
of
a
governess
doing
shopping
and
often
visiting
a
no
girl
might
go
without
showing
an
exeat
signed
by
the
principal
the
was
expected
to
examine
and
file
these
permits
before
marshalling
her
flock
on
this
particular
wednesday
laura
janet
irma
and
ethelberga
had
set
their
hearts
on
seeing
the
temple
bells
at
the
cinema
the
fact
that
they
had
duly
had
their
turn
a
fortnight
before
and
had
witnessed
a
wildly
exciting
performance
of
love
and
war
in
the
east
only
made
them
keener
for
more
thrills
when
avelyn
a
little
tired
of
the
general
atmosphere
of
lamentation
suggested
palliating
circumstances
their
wrath
blazed
out
in
her
direction
it
all
very
well
for
to
talk
you
can
go
on
friday
evening
or
saturday
if
you
like
you
half
a
day
girl
after
all
you
do
really
sympathize
with
all
right
do
get
baity
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
never
come
in
to
harlingden
on
saturdays
so
you
no
need
to
envy
me
envy
you
envy
a
boarder
sneered
laura
with
a
whole
world
of
condescension
in
her
voice
my
dear
child
i
think
you
really
understand
what
you
talking
about
after
all
you
only
been
at
silverside
two
months
it
is
not
a
particularly
pleasant
matter
to
find
the
public
opinion
of
your
dormitory
dead
against
you
you
are
apt
to
get
awkward
knocks
in
consequence
avelyn
put
up
with
some
very
withering
remarks
that
tuesday
evening
and
consequently
felt
sore
they
absolute
blighters
she
thought
i
wish
i
could
play
a
rag
on
them
it
would
just
serve
them
jolly
well
right
chapter
x
mischief
avelyn
i
regret
to
say
was
no
ideal
heroine
of
fiction
but
a
particularly
human
girl
with
a
strong
spice
of
mischief
in
her
composition
she
considered
that
she
owed
her
a
grudge
and
she
cast
about
for
a
suitable
opportunity
of
paying
the
debt
as
it
happened
fortune
favoured
her
miss
kennedy
sent
her
to
the
study
to
fetch
a
book
that
was
required
she
knocked
at
the
door
and
as
nobody
answered
she
turned
the
handle
and
went
in
the
room
was
empty
she
found
volume
iii
of
the
and
as
she
turned
from
the
bookcase
she
cast
an
eye
on
miss
thompson
desk
it
was
spread
with
papers
and
in
front
just
beside
the
inkpot
was
a
whole
pile
of
exeat
forms
they
were
little
printed
sheets
bearing
the
words
silverside
hereby
certify
that
is
allowed
leave
of
absence
for
the
when
a
girl
visited
the
town
she
was
given
one
of
these
forms
duly
filled
in
by
the
principal
without
whose
signature
it
was
not
valid
the
system
perhaps
savoured
of
red
tape
but
it
saved
the
mistresses
the
trouble
of
enquiring
from
who
were
to
compose
their
parties
avelyn
looked
critically
and
covetously
at
the
exeats
each
represented
so
much
fun
to
one
girl
a
sudden
idea
struck
her
she
laughed
aloud
at
the
thought
of
it
and
yielding
to
the
impulse
counted
out
four
of
the
forms
and
popped
them
into
her
pocket
then
she
fled
back
to
the
waiting
miss
kennedy
with
volume
iii
of
the
wednesday
afternoons
at
silverside
were
chiefly
devoted
to
optional
subjects
the
violin
master
came
to
give
lessons
and
several
girls
whose
spines
were
suspected
of
symptoms
of
crookedness
did
special
physical
exercises
under
the
eye
of
a
gymnastic
teacher
the
elocution
pupils
met
in
the
sixth
form
room
and
learned
to
recite
shakespeare
while
those
who
were
taking
wended
their
way
to
the
studio
those
unfortunates
whose
parents
did
not
rise
to
extras
were
herded
together
in
the
regardless
of
forms
and
did
plain
sewing
or
printing
a
band
of
privileged
boarders
under
guardianship
of
a
mistress
started
at
for
the
dissipations
of
the
city
now
at
avelyn
was
due
for
her
music
lesson
she
put
her
pieces
and
studies
into
her
case
washed
her
hands
carefully
retied
her
hair
ribbon
scented
her
and
sauntered
down
the
corridor
she
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
door
of
the
fifth
form
room
then
entered
laura
talbot
was
sitting
disconsolately
on
one
of
the
desks
girding
at
life
to
a
sympathetic
audience
avelyn
thrust
the
four
exeat
forms
into
her
hand
and
remarked
for
the
cowslip
room
and
i
got
to
go
to
my
music
lesson
is
it
hard
luck
i
late
as
it
is
and
harrison
gets
baity
if
kept
waiting
laura
stared
at
the
forms
for
a
moment
utterly
staggered
then
incomprehension
changed
to
joy
and
she
jumped
from
the
desk
irma
janet
ethelberga
we
got
exeats
oh
jubilate
scurry
quick
and
get
ready
we
only
just
time
to
change
our
things
oh
i
say
to
think
of
seeing
temple
bells
after
all
an
agitated
ten
minutes
followed
in
which
the
four
girls
almost
tumbled
over
one
another
in
the
hurry
of
making
their
toilets
laura
put
on
her
best
hat
and
birthday
furs
ethelberga
sported
a
bracelet
irma
after
foraging
at
the
back
of
her
top
drawer
was
distinctly
seen
to
abstract
a
powder
puff
and
apply
it
to
the
tip
of
her
nose
janet
tried
to
coax
her
fingers
into
new
gloves
a
quarter
of
a
size
too
small
there
was
an
unlocking
of
cashboxes
and
a
taking
out
of
money
at
the
eleventh
hour
they
sped
down
the
stairs
into
the
hall
the
little
party
of
elect
were
drawn
up
ready
to
go
and
only
waiting
for
miss
peters
that
lady
had
been
impeded
in
her
dressing
and
consequently
came
hurrying
up
very
much
flustered
she
was
a
gentle
depressed
little
person
who
had
been
pitchforked
into
teaching
against
her
will
her
weak
point
was
discipline
and
the
girls
knew
it
and
took
base
advantage
now
instead
of
forming
an
orderly
crocodile
they
clustered
round
her
clamouring
all
sorts
of
requests
for
things
they
wanted
to
do
in
town
if
there
time
dear
me
i
do
know
i
ca
promise
anything
it
will
all
depend
replied
the
harassed
mistress
she
collected
the
exeats
and
counted
them
automatically
in
her
flurry
she
never
noticed
that
four
of
them
were
not
filled
in
with
names
or
signed
laura
had
handed
them
to
her
without
herself
noticing
the
omission
there
was
nobody
to
rectify
the
mistake
so
the
four
in
most
exuberant
spirits
started
in
the
crocodile
for
harlingden
they
accomplished
a
few
purchases
in
the
town
but
poor
miss
peters
found
it
so
difficult
to
keep
her
flock
together
that
she
was
forced
to
abandon
the
shops
and
suggested
the
cinema
she
considered
her
rôle
of
duenna
anything
but
an
enviable
position
and
would
willingly
that
afternoon
have
exchanged
jobs
with
a
charwoman
she
breathed
more
freely
when
she
had
piloted
her
lively
young
charges
up
the
stairs
at
the
picture
palace
and
ensconced
them
in
a
giggling
double
row
in
the
balcony
for
a
blissful
hour
and
a
half
they
would
be
out
of
mischief
with
eyes
fixed
only
on
the
marvellous
scenes
from
india
meantime
while
laura
irma
janet
and
ethelberga
were
staring
fascinated
at
the
bewildering
east
following
the
heroine
through
a
series
of
dazzling
adventures
things
at
silverside
were
taking
a
prosaic
and
totally
different
turn
it
happened
that
irma
and
janet
whose
french
recitations
that
morning
had
been
a
dismal
failure
were
due
in
the
fourth
form
room
that
afternoon
to
say
their
returned
poetry
lesson
to
mademoiselle
she
waited
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
them
then
as
they
did
not
turn
up
she
instituted
enquiries
several
reliable
witnesses
informed
her
that
they
had
been
seen
and
envied
departing
with
the
crocodile
for
harlingden
mademoiselle
temper
was
naturally
peppery
and
under
such
provocation
as
this
she
burst
forth
in
great
indignation
what
go
out
to
pleasure
when
i
tell
them
to
come
and
say
lessons
to
me
it
is
what
you
call
the
limit
of
what
use
to
try
to
teach
if
they
are
to
do
only
what
they
like
i
go
straight
to
tell
miss
thompson
mademoiselle
was
brimming
over
with
wrath
and
poured
out
her
complaints
vehemently
in
the
study
the
principal
lips
tightened
as
she
listened
i
did
not
give
exeats
to
janet
and
irma
this
shall
be
enquired
into
mademoiselle
she
replied
miss
thompson
meant
what
she
said
when
the
crocodile
returned
from
harlingden
she
was
waiting
in
the
hall
and
ordered
laura
irma
janet
and
ethelberga
to
report
themselves
in
her
study
the
scene
which
followed
was
short
and
stormy
the
girls
whose
minds
had
scarcely
yet
become
detached
from
indian
jungles
and
hindoo
palaces
were
suddenly
accused
of
having
played
truant
they
denied
pleading
that
they
had
exeats
where
did
you
get
these
exeats
demanded
miss
thompson
sternly
they
were
handed
to
us
in
the
schoolroom
by
whom
with
one
consent
the
girls
hesitated
they
did
not
wish
to
throw
the
blame
upon
avelyn
you
refuse
to
tell
me
said
the
principal
very
well
you
may
go
to
the
first
form
room
where
your
tea
will
be
sent
to
you
i
shall
sift
the
matter
thoroughly
after
preparation
it
is
disgraceful
that
such
a
thing
should
happen
at
silverside
when
preparation
was
over
that
evening
the
boarders
were
ordered
to
assemble
in
the
big
schoolroom
they
went
in
much
astonishment
wondering
for
what
reason
they
were
thus
summoned
a
whisper
got
about
that
four
girls
were
in
trouble
but
on
what
exact
count
nobody
seemed
to
know
they
had
scarcely
taken
their
places
when
miss
thompson
entered
she
looked
worried
and
serious
a
decorous
silence
pervaded
the
room
everyone
was
alert
with
expectation
and
intense
interest
there
was
a
sensation
as
when
thunder
is
in
the
air
after
an
impressive
pause
the
principal
standing
so
that
her
eyes
scanned
all
the
faces
fronting
her
stated
the
case
briefly
a
thing
has
occurred
which
has
never
happened
here
before
four
girls
went
into
harlingden
without
leave
they
tell
me
that
they
were
handed
exeats
by
a
schoolfellow
and
believed
that
they
had
my
permission
for
the
holiday
i
have
examined
the
exeats
that
were
given
in
to
miss
peters
and
find
that
four
of
them
are
unsigned
i
can
only
conclude
that
somebody
must
have
taken
these
exeats
from
my
study
i
intend
to
find
out
who
that
person
is
can
anybody
give
any
information
on
the
subject
there
was
absolute
stillness
in
the
room
every
girl
looked
at
her
neighbour
avelyn
sat
as
if
petrified
until
that
moment
it
had
never
struck
her
that
her
practical
joke
might
have
any
serious
issue
she
had
not
expected
her
to
believe
that
the
exeats
were
genuine
she
thought
that
when
they
looked
at
them
they
would
notice
at
once
that
they
were
unsigned
and
therefore
not
valid
it
was
incredible
that
miss
peters
should
also
have
accepted
them
what
was
intended
for
a
piece
of
silly
fun
had
assumed
the
aspect
of
a
very
grave
fault
i
will
ask
miss
peters
to
tell
us
what
she
knows
said
miss
thompson
turning
to
the
mistress
miss
peters
much
worried
and
embarrassed
could
only
state
that
she
had
counted
the
exeats
which
tallied
with
the
number
of
girls
she
had
taken
in
to
town
in
her
hurry
she
had
not
examined
every
paper
and
could
not
say
whether
they
were
signed
or
not
it
was
an
unpleasant
situation
for
the
poor
governess
she
was
conscious
that
she
had
been
slack
in
the
performance
of
her
duties
and
that
it
was
owing
to
her
negligence
that
the
affair
had
been
possible
though
the
principal
did
not
openly
blame
her
she
felt
that
she
stood
reproved
before
the
school
laura
janet
irma
and
ethelberga
sat
overwhelmed
and
injured
but
stubbornly
determined
not
to
betray
their
they
felt
that
they
would
rather
take
the
blame
themselves
than
sneak
i
give
you
all
one
last
chance
said
miss
thompson
can
any
girl
throw
a
light
on
this
unfortunate
affair
the
head
mistress
spoke
clearly
and
slowly
her
glance
passed
along
row
after
row
of
young
faces
as
if
she
would
read
their
very
souls
a
minute
of
ghastly
quiet
followed
a
horrible
minute
that
seemed
as
long
as
a
year
then
avelyn
rose
she
was
very
pale
and
stood
erect
with
her
head
thrown
a
little
back
i
think
i
can
clear
it
up
miss
thompson
she
answered
in
a
voice
that
was
steady
but
full
of
suppressed
emotion
it
was
i
who
gave
out
those
exeats
avelyn
watson
and
on
what
authority
from
where
did
you
get
them
from
your
study
table
my
study
table
repeated
miss
thompson
her
manner
growing
still
more
grave
what
were
you
doing
in
my
study
avelyn
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
herself
but
she
did
not
hesitate
i
was
sent
to
fetch
a
book
i
saw
the
exeats
lying
on
the
table
and
i
took
four
of
them
to
give
to
the
girls
i
meant
it
as
a
joke
i
did
not
think
they
would
believe
they
were
real
ones
a
murmur
of
amazement
almost
a
laugh
circulated
through
the
room
miss
thompson
checked
it
sternly
do
you
understand
avelyn
watson
what
a
liberty
you
have
taken
you
were
sent
into
my
study
for
a
certain
purpose
and
you
took
advantage
of
the
privilege
of
entering
my
room
to
peruse
the
papers
on
my
desk
and
to
steal
yes
i
use
the
word
deliberately
to
some
of
them
i
do
know
how
you
view
such
conduct
but
at
silverside
we
consider
it
utterly
unworthy
of
a
lady
you
owe
me
an
instant
apology
avelyn
writhed
under
her
mistress
scathing
words
i
very
sorry
miss
thompson
i
never
thought
of
it
as
anything
but
a
joke
i
apologize
most
sincerely
i
did
mean
to
get
anybody
into
trouble
the
principal
looked
searchingly
at
avelyn
you
have
been
guilty
of
a
very
grave
breach
of
discipline
she
replied
i
accept
your
apology
because
you
have
spoken
up
and
confessed
but
i
can
not
let
such
an
episode
go
unpunished
until
you
return
home
on
friday
afternoon
you
are
not
to
speak
to
a
single
girl
in
the
school
you
will
attend
classes
as
usual
but
you
will
take
your
meals
in
the
studio
and
will
sit
alone
there
during
recreation
hours
you
are
also
prohibited
from
writing
any
letters
or
taking
any
books
from
the
library
you
may
spend
your
time
upon
your
lessons
go
to
the
studio
now
and
your
supper
will
be
brought
to
you
i
put
every
girl
on
her
honour
not
to
speak
or
write
to
avelyn
watson
until
next
monday
avelyn
walked
out
of
the
room
quite
steadily
but
with
downcast
eyes
she
had
the
feeling
of
one
who
has
fallen
suddenly
into
a
pit
it
was
a
horrible
experience
to
be
there
arraigned
tried
and
found
guilty
before
all
her
companions
miss
thompson
sarcastic
comments
hurt
her
more
than
the
punishment
she
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
alone
in
the
studio
and
was
left
there
half
an
hour
beyond
her
usual
bedtime
when
she
went
at
last
to
her
own
dormitory
the
other
girls
were
in
bed
and
feigned
to
be
asleep
miss
kennedy
came
in
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
told
her
that
she
must
dress
in
the
all
day
long
her
coventry
was
preserved
the
girls
indeed
cast
surreptitious
glances
of
sympathy
at
her
but
they
were
on
their
honour
not
to
speak
or
write
and
they
did
not
break
their
word
it
was
a
hard
penance
to
sit
by
herself
without
even
a
to
amuse
her
she
felt
specially
lonely
after
four
when
she
knew
her
friends
would
be
laughing
and
chatting
together
round
the
fire
and
perhaps
roasting
chestnuts
the
studio
was
not
a
particularly
cheerful
room
for
solitary
confinement
as
the
dusk
closed
in
the
casts
loomed
like
white
ghosts
from
the
corners
and
she
could
almost
fancy
that
the
eyes
of
the
plaster
venus
deliberately
winked
at
her
she
had
no
matches
and
nobody
came
in
to
light
the
gas
she
had
not
even
the
satisfaction
of
a
fire
to
poke
for
the
studio
was
heated
with
pipes
she
did
not
expect
her
tea
to
be
brought
to
her
before
if
i
were
going
home
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
she
thought
thank
goodness
i
only
a
weekly
boarder
i
do
think
they
might
have
come
and
lit
the
gas
the
room
was
getting
more
and
more
dim
and
avelyn
spirits
fell
in
exact
ratio
she
was
beginning
to
feel
an
almost
superstitious
horror
of
the
plaster
venus
suppose
it
were
to
come
to
life
like
statue
of
galatea
the
bare
fancy
gave
her
shivers
and
a
sudden
sound
made
her
turn
with
a
start
it
was
nothing
less
than
an
unmistakable
tap
on
the
outside
of
the
window
avelyn
nerves
were
strung
at
highest
pitch
she
almost
screamed
aloud
peering
in
through
the
darkness
was
a
face
she
forced
herself
to
approach
and
look
and
with
a
revulsion
of
feeling
recognized
the
enquiring
countenance
of
her
brother
david
with
his
freckled
nose
pressed
flat
against
the
glass
he
tapped
again
and
she
opened
the
window
dave
you
mascot
how
did
you
get
here
climbed
up
the
spout
chuckled
david
it
was
quite
easy
move
out
of
the
way
i
coming
in
he
dropped
inside
the
room
then
turning
to
the
window
again
gave
a
soft
whistle
tony
down
below
he
explained
and
he
swarm
up
too
now
given
him
the
signal
i
just
lend
him
a
hand
over
that
last
piece
of
coping
here
he
is
come
on
old
chap
we
struck
the
right
shanty
after
all
told
you
you
might
trust
your
grandfather
anthony
made
his
appearance
with
equal
caution
his
round
face
was
wreathed
in
delighted
smiles
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
fix
exactly
window
he
volunteered
but
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
asked
avelyn
ecstatically
we
met
pamela
at
the
station
and
she
told
us
all
about
it
so
instead
of
going
home
by
the
we
thought
we
come
up
and
see
how
you
were
getting
on
we
made
pam
describe
which
room
you
were
in
added
david
i
say
a
bit
of
beastly
bad
luck
for
you
pretty
stiff
i
call
it
to
be
shut
up
here
it
too
ghastly
for
words
cheer
oh
we
brought
you
something
look
david
felt
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
paper
bag
full
of
toffee
and
a
copy
of
do
to
read
we
have
got
you
more
only
we
did
happen
to
have
much
money
with
us
it
was
lucky
we
met
pam
before
we
got
into
the
train
commented
anthony
we
were
earlier
than
usual
at
the
station
as
a
rule
we
tear
up
at
the
last
moment
it
was
ripping
of
you
to
come
well
we
could
desert
you
old
sport
at
such
a
pinch
i
do
believe
anyone
could
have
such
decent
brothers
avelyn
gazed
at
him
through
the
gathering
darkness
with
admiration
at
that
moment
a
tread
of
footsteps
and
a
rattle
of
crockery
sounded
in
the
passage
goody
it
my
tea
coming
she
gasped
there
was
not
time
for
the
boys
to
make
their
exit
through
the
window
while
the
door
handle
was
turning
they
fled
to
what
cover
they
could
find
david
took
shelter
behind
the
pedestal
of
apollo
and
anthony
crouched
in
a
corner
among
some
drawing
boards
fortunately
it
was
miss
dickens
who
entered
and
miss
dickens
was
take
this
tray
from
me
avelyn
she
commanded
dear
me
you
all
in
the
dark
here
has
nobody
been
to
light
the
gas
yet
no
miss
dickens
i
must
fetch
some
matches
then
be
careful
not
to
upset
that
tray
as
you
put
it
down
the
second
her
back
was
turned
the
boys
flew
to
the
window
and
dropping
out
one
after
the
other
made
their
way
safely
down
the
spout
into
the
garden
below
whence
they
waved
parting
salutations
and
retreated
with
all
speed
avelyn
had
just
time
to
hide
the
toffee
and
the
before
miss
dickens
returned
with
the
matches
and
lit
the
gas
she
assumed
an
air
of
appropriate
subjection
and
melancholy
before
her
mistress
which
at
the
moment
she
certainly
did
not
experience
until
four
on
friday
her
punishment
continued
not
a
single
word
was
exchanged
between
herself
and
her
schoolfellows
she
had
never
felt
so
glad
to
go
home
the
made
a
break
and
when
she
returned
to
school
on
monday
she
found
herself
apparently
forgiven
at
and
no
more
a
black
sheep
but
an
ordinary
member
of
society
her
attitude
was
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
gratitude
you
the
limit
ave
said
irma
i
never
have
thought
of
it
myself
admitted
janet
it
was
such
a
topping
idea
chuckled
laura
and
we
all
got
just
the
very
time
of
our
lives
at
temple
bells
thanks
to
you
added
ethelberga
but
i
never
intended
it
for
anything
but
a
joke
protested
avelyn
chapter
xi
moss
cottage
though
avelyn
was
happy
enough
as
a
boarder
at
silverside
the
real
focus
and
centre
of
her
life
lay
at
walden
the
little
house
with
its
romantic
surroundings
had
touched
a
very
deep
chord
in
her
nature
home
had
been
dear
in
harlingden
because
it
was
home
but
now
it
was
a
magic
spot
a
palace
of
fairy
dreams
a
place
where
new
and
hitherto
interests
and
ideals
had
suddenly
leaped
into
being
the
glamour
of
it
seemed
to
begin
when
she
stepped
out
of
the
train
at
netherton
on
friday
afternoons
and
started
on
her
walk
to
lyngates
different
neighbourhoods
seem
to
have
different
scents
this
one
smelled
of
lichens
and
green
ferns
and
moist
warm
earth
a
odour
that
she
got
used
to
directly
but
which
struck
her
afresh
each
time
as
she
returned
to
it
every
inch
of
the
road
had
grown
dear
to
her
and
she
would
welcome
each
clump
of
ferns
or
gurgling
reach
of
stream
as
if
she
were
greeting
old
friends
after
five
days
in
the
prosaic
workaday
little
world
of
school
her
seemed
to
belong
to
a
different
planet
avelyn
was
a
girl
who
loved
sometimes
to
be
quite
alone
she
had
a
favourite
seat
on
the
orchard
wall
among
the
ivy
where
she
would
curl
herself
up
with
her
back
against
an
apple
tree
and
watch
the
landscape
below
so
changeful
and
wonderful
were
the
effects
of
storm
and
sunshine
over
this
valley
that
it
never
looked
for
one
the
same
sometimes
there
would
be
sunrise
tints
of
rose
and
violet
sometimes
a
soft
yellow
haze
sometimes
would
roll
from
end
to
end
or
perhaps
a
magnificent
rainbow
would
span
the
gorge
like
an
ethereal
bridge
or
grander
still
the
lightning
would
flash
its
wicked
forks
over
the
hills
from
summit
to
base
gleaming
against
a
background
of
inky
darkness
the
very
air
at
walden
seemed
softer
than
at
harlingden
it
was
a
mild
autumn
leaves
lingered
long
on
the
trees
and
made
the
woods
gorgeous
and
hung
in
exuberant
masses
over
the
hedgerows
like
a
soft
silver
cloud
trying
to
veil
the
growing
bareness
beneath
one
saturday
early
in
december
avelyn
started
off
to
see
pamela
it
was
some
distance
to
moss
cottage
and
instead
of
walking
by
the
high
road
she
meant
to
take
a
path
that
led
up
the
gorge
and
across
the
hill
it
was
a
glorious
morning
a
grey
sky
showed
here
and
there
bright
patches
of
blue
between
the
masses
of
heavy
clouds
that
were
rolling
down
from
the
like
smoke
from
a
cauldron
and
fitful
gleams
of
sunshine
bursting
out
in
wonderful
brilliance
made
marvellous
effects
of
light
and
shadow
the
river
winding
slowly
through
the
marsh
lands
was
now
vivid
blue
now
inky
purple
as
it
reflected
the
clouds
or
the
sunshine
a
mass
of
showed
dark
in
contrast
to
the
red
of
the
ploughed
field
on
its
summit
which
was
catching
the
light
descending
in
rays
from
one
bright
patch
above
in
a
few
moments
all
had
changed
the
larches
were
tipped
with
gold
the
marsh
lands
were
purest
emerald
and
the
hills
veiled
in
filmy
mists
floating
like
threads
of
gossamer
down
the
slopes
avelyn
turned
from
this
wide
prospect
and
plunged
up
the
glen
with
her
face
towards
the
hill
whence
the
mist
was
rolling
ages
ago
a
glacier
must
have
slidden
down
there
and
left
its
mark
on
the
huge
boulders
which
lay
scattered
everywhere
around
over
this
rough
bed
a
stream
swollen
by
days
of
incessant
rain
thundered
along
its
brown
waters
churned
to
the
whitest
spray
as
it
forced
its
way
in
leaping
cataracts
over
the
rocks
which
could
be
easily
crossed
in
july
were
deep
under
feet
of
foam
and
the
lower
boughs
of
the
trees
were
washed
and
swayed
by
the
flood
it
was
so
sheltered
that
the
gale
which
had
stripped
the
leaves
on
the
above
had
spared
enough
here
to
tint
the
gorge
with
gold
and
brown
some
of
the
oaks
were
still
green
a
birch
displayed
the
purest
naples
yellow
mountain
ashes
and
alders
had
kept
their
summer
clothing
intact
and
the
thick
undergrowth
of
briar
and
bramble
was
verdant
as
ever
even
more
beautiful
perhaps
were
the
bare
boughs
of
the
hazel
copse
the
exquisite
tender
shades
of
which
were
such
a
subtle
blending
of
purples
and
greys
as
to
defy
the
most
cunning
brush
that
artist
ever
wielded
and
contrasted
with
an
occasional
pine
or
holly
or
ivy
tree
made
a
dream
of
delicate
colour
the
boulders
were
almost
completely
covered
with
vivid
green
mosses
in
sheets
so
thick
and
deep
and
compact
that
a
slight
pull
would
raise
a
yard
at
a
time
here
and
there
among
them
were
tiny
bright
red
toadstools
or
some
of
the
larger
purple
or
orange
varieties
that
had
lingered
on
since
october
on
a
hazel
twig
avelyn
found
the
curious
fungus
with
its
tiny
eggs
packed
neatly
inside
the
day
was
so
mild
that
a
squirrel
was
taking
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
waving
his
feathery
tail
from
a
fir
tree
overhead
but
at
the
sight
of
a
human
being
he
disappeared
suddenly
into
a
hollow
in
a
big
tree
where
no
doubt
he
had
established
cosy
winter
quarters
there
were
few
birds
perhaps
they
did
not
like
the
dampness
or
the
roar
of
the
water
but
avelyn
caught
sight
of
a
dipper
darting
down
the
stream
a
flight
of
tits
twittering
noisily
for
a
moment
or
two
on
a
and
a
heron
sailing
majestically
towards
the
mountains
on
the
brambles
the
unpicked
blackberries
still
hung
ripe
though
so
absolutely
sodden
and
tasteless
that
they
were
not
worth
the
eating
there
was
even
a
spray
of
blossom
left
here
and
there
a
branch
of
scarlet
hips
shone
brightly
in
the
sunlight
the
birds
sated
with
yew
berries
had
spared
it
thus
far
and
it
rivalled
the
holly
on
the
bush
close
by
while
trails
of
bryony
berries
repeated
the
colour
with
varieties
of
lemon
and
orange
there
were
a
few
wild
flowers
even
in
december
a
belated
foxglove
a
clump
of
ragwort
a
blue
harebell
or
a
stray
specimen
of
buttercup
campion
herb
robert
yarrow
thistle
and
actually
a
strawberry
blossom
the
tall
equisetum
lingered
on
the
boggy
bank
and
ferns
were
everywhere
green
great
clumps
of
the
common
polypody
clung
to
the
and
flourished
on
boughs
high
overhead
and
under
the
rocks
grew
the
delicate
fronds
of
the
english
maidenhair
or
the
rarer
beech
fern
avelyn
had
at
last
reached
the
waterfall
the
great
white
cascade
leaped
over
a
ledge
of
rock
and
dashed
with
such
thundering
force
into
the
pool
below
that
all
the
air
around
was
filled
with
floating
mist
on
which
the
sun
formed
a
dancing
rainbow
as
each
neighbourhood
has
its
own
distinctive
scent
so
each
stream
has
its
own
peculiar
sound
as
if
it
would
give
us
some
message
that
it
has
no
words
to
convey
the
little
gurgling
brook
tries
to
tell
us
cheery
things
the
river
has
a
sadder
story
the
trout
stream
babbles
kindly
hopes
to
avelyn
the
leaping
rushing
cascade
with
its
whirl
of
living
dashing
foam
seemed
to
be
calling
out
in
a
voice
that
rose
and
fell
with
the
roar
of
the
waters
therefore
with
angels
and
archangels
and
with
all
the
company
of
heaven
we
laud
and
magnify
thy
glorious
name
she
stood
a
long
time
gazing
at
the
foam
and
the
mist
and
the
rainbow
then
she
turned
and
plunged
up
among
the
trees
to
the
head
of
the
glen
looking
back
she
felt
as
if
she
had
held
nature
or
something
bigger
than
nature
tight
by
the
hand
from
the
top
of
the
gorge
was
an
easy
walk
across
fields
to
moss
cottage
in
spite
of
the
bright
morning
the
little
house
looked
gloomy
among
the
trees
it
always
struck
avelyn
with
an
air
of
extreme
melancholy
she
was
almost
morbidly
sensitive
to
impressions
she
decided
that
she
would
not
go
to
the
front
door
because
she
would
then
be
certain
to
see
pamela
mother
and
somehow
she
felt
rather
frightened
of
poor
quiet
retiring
reynolds
she
knew
that
her
friend
would
probably
be
at
work
in
the
garden
so
she
tacked
into
the
wood
and
climbed
the
palings
at
the
back
only
half
of
the
ground
behind
the
cottage
had
as
yet
been
brought
into
cultivation
and
the
part
where
avelyn
descended
was
still
a
wilderness
there
were
large
rocks
and
tangled
masses
of
brambles
and
faded
clumps
of
ragwort
and
teasel
and
yellow
bracken
stumps
not
far
away
however
was
a
border
with
a
spade
lying
on
the
ground
and
pamela
hat
pamela
herself
was
not
to
be
seen
but
surely
she
must
be
somewhere
near
avelyn
prowled
about
in
search
of
her
she
did
not
want
to
go
up
to
the
cottage
and
decided
that
if
her
friend
were
indoors
she
would
wait
until
she
came
out
again
possibly
she
might
be
in
the
that
was
certainly
an
alternative
she
had
heard
pamela
mention
hens
in
the
distance
some
roofs
were
visible
which
looked
like
outbuildings
she
went
to
investigate
right
in
the
far
corner
of
the
garden
almost
indeed
in
the
wood
itself
and
thickly
embedded
in
trees
she
came
upon
a
ramshackle
kind
of
stable
a
giant
oak
shrouded
with
ivy
stretched
out
long
protecting
arms
and
almost
hid
it
from
view
the
roof
was
built
against
the
very
bole
of
the
tree
whose
branches
sheltered
the
windows
was
pamela
here
avelyn
gave
a
long
and
called
her
name
the
next
moment
a
startled
face
looked
out
from
the
upper
window
hallo
pam
shouted
avelyn
gleefully
i
unearthed
you
at
last
old
sport
wait
a
sec
i
come
down
returned
her
friend
in
a
cautious
voice
pamela
appeared
from
out
the
stable
door
with
a
rainbow
face
in
which
storm
and
sunshine
seemed
to
be
struggling
i
never
expected
to
see
you
ave
have
you
dropped
from
the
skies
no
climbed
over
the
palings
i
thought
i
be
sure
to
find
you
somewhere
about
in
the
garden
i
saw
your
hat
and
went
to
look
for
you
yes
i
was
gardening
is
this
your
no
it
not
the
it
just
a
kind
of
stable
it
reminds
me
of
the
swiss
family
robinson
or
robin
hood
shanty
in
the
depths
of
sherwood
forest
you
could
climb
up
that
tree
if
you
got
on
to
the
roof
as
avelyn
eyes
glanced
up
the
bole
of
the
huge
oak
pamela
followed
with
a
look
of
strained
anxiety
she
laid
her
hand
on
her
friend
arm
and
drew
her
inside
the
stable
she
seemed
ill
at
ease
what
the
matter
pam
oh
nothing
you
not
yourself
at
all
yes
indeed
i
am
i
do
believe
you
pleased
to
see
me
ave
i
been
dreaming
of
you
all
the
morning
then
what
is
it
pamela
was
silent
something
worrying
you
i
can
see
that
plainly
enough
yes
i
own
i
worried
wo
you
tell
me
i
ca
is
it
a
secret
it
is
just
at
present
i
want
to
think
it
over
while
she
spoke
pamela
kept
glancing
anxiously
out
at
the
door
she
suddenly
turned
with
frightened
eyes
ave
uncle
fritz
is
coming
you
must
hide
quick
he
must
catch
you
here
for
all
the
world
run
behind
this
stall
do
move
till
gone
illustration
avelyn
crouched
under
the
manger
could
hear
the
bullying
tone
in
his
voice
she
hustled
avelyn
into
the
darkest
corner
of
the
stable
then
herself
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
the
ladder
that
led
to
the
floor
above
a
sound
of
footsteps
brushing
the
grass
was
heard
from
outside
and
in
another
moment
hockheimer
entered
what
are
you
doing
down
here
he
asked
sharply
i
told
you
to
stop
upstairs
i
only
just
come
down
any
message
no
none
at
all
one
might
come
just
when
you
are
fooling
about
here
he
frowned
why
do
you
do
as
i
tell
you
avelyn
crouched
under
the
manger
could
not
see
his
face
but
she
could
hear
the
bullying
tone
in
his
voice
do
you
think
i
feed
you
and
educate
you
for
you
to
do
just
as
you
like
continued
hockheimer
angrily
what
would
become
of
you
if
it
were
for
me
i
should
like
to
know
another
time
when
i
set
you
to
do
anything
you
do
it
or
i
know
the
reason
why
here
get
up
and
let
me
pass
he
pulled
her
roughly
off
the
ladder
and
walked
up
himself
his
footsteps
creaked
on
the
boarded
floor
above
then
all
was
silence
pamela
crept
softly
up
the
ladder
peeped
into
the
room
above
and
descended
as
quietly
as
she
came
then
crossing
to
the
stall
where
avelyn
was
hidden
put
her
finger
on
her
lips
for
silence
and
beckoned
her
friend
towards
the
door
she
led
her
hurriedly
along
the
garden
neither
spoke
a
word
till
they
reached
the
palings
i
awfully
sorry
i
came
pam
apologized
avelyn
never
mind
you
could
help
it
how
should
you
know
uncle
fritz
would
be
here
i
certainly
should
have
come
if
i
had
known
who
would
ave
have
you
ever
seen
a
little
wild
linnet
get
into
a
net
no
i
have
it
runs
and
struggles
and
beats
its
wings
and
the
more
it
tries
to
escape
the
worse
it
gets
caught
in
the
meshes
ave
at
present
i
feel
like
that
linnet
ca
i
help
you
pam
not
yet
i
want
to
think
when
i
really
feel
you
can
help
me
i
shall
come
and
ask
you
you
would
fail
me
i
help
you
for
all
i
worth
if
it
against
your
uncle
pamela
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
so
utterly
alone
she
faltered
mother
does
understand
since
father
died
she
has
never
cared
for
anything
she
content
to
live
here
on
uncle
bounty
she
so
absolutely
trusting
and
unsuspicious
just
like
a
child
i
never
can
get
her
to
see
things
as
i
do
although
hardly
fourteen
i
often
feel
that
i
know
more
of
the
world
than
she
does
just
at
present
mother
is
going
about
with
her
eyes
closed
and
you
i
keeping
my
eyes
particularly
wide
open
and
my
mouth
tight
shut
replied
pamela
as
she
kissed
her
friend
and
helped
her
to
climb
the
palings
avelyn
went
home
very
thoughtfully
she
found
the
boys
digging
in
the
kitchen
garden
and
confided
to
them
her
morning
experience
they
decided
that
something
mysterious
must
be
going
on
at
moss
cottage
it
looks
fishy
said
david
slowly
scraping
the
earth
off
his
boots
with
the
edge
of
his
spade
what
has
that
old
hun
got
up
his
sleeve
enquired
anthony
shaking
his
head
i
do
know
after
what
we
saw
in
the
wood
i
believe
anything
of
him
shall
we
tell
the
vicar
or
somebody
suggested
avelyn
no
no
protested
david
emphatically
whatever
you
do
ave
for
goodness
sake
do
blab
we
no
proper
evidence
yet
and
if
stories
begin
to
get
about
the
village
he
know
he
suspected
and
he
be
careful
just
you
leave
this
to
me
it
my
first
and
i
want
to
worry
it
out
remember
i
going
to
be
a
barrister
some
day
when
the
war
is
over
if
i
do
go
out
to
france
first
and
get
killed
old
hockheimer
deep
but
he
does
know
we
watching
him
two
british
boys
ought
to
be
a
match
for
a
german
i
shoot
him
first
and
watch
him
afterwards
if
i
had
my
way
declared
tony
bloodthirstily
it
was
on
that
very
same
afternoon
that
a
fresh
planet
swam
into
the
watson
horizon
or
in
other
words
that
they
made
a
new
acquaintance
the
vicar
was
distinctly
responsible
for
it
he
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
churchyard
steps
talking
to
a
somebody
the
toe
of
whose
boot
alone
was
visible
round
the
corner
and
when
he
saw
anthony
passing
in
the
road
below
he
beckoned
to
him
tony
mounted
the
steps
and
found
that
the
boot
belonged
to
a
young
officer
in
khaki
who
stood
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
contemplating
the
tombstones
hallo
sonnie
said
the
vicar
affably
doing
anything
special
this
afternoon
this
is
captain
harper
who
in
charge
of
the
camp
near
the
river
he
wants
to
go
and
see
the
roman
fort
on
the
top
of
weldon
hill
and
he
does
know
the
way
have
you
time
to
take
him
anthony
grey
eyes
scanned
the
captain
dark
ones
for
one
searching
moment
but
in
that
moment
he
loved
him
and
would
have
offered
to
act
guide
to
the
top
of
mount
everest
if
required
i
like
to
go
he
volunteered
you
do
mind
david
coming
too
do
you
i
do
know
who
david
is
but
let
him
come
by
all
means
smiled
the
officer
thanks
very
much
holt
for
finding
someone
to
conduct
me
so
it
happened
that
david
and
anthony
started
off
with
captain
harper
and
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
roman
camp
they
had
decided
that
they
liked
him
awfully
and
when
they
returned
to
lyngates
they
felt
as
if
they
had
known
him
for
years
they
talked
about
school
and
football
and
fishing
and
treacling
for
moths
and
a
great
many
other
interesting
topics
and
he
told
them
a
little
about
his
experiences
at
the
front
and
how
he
had
been
wounded
how
long
have
you
been
at
netherton
asked
anthony
as
they
paused
by
the
gate
of
walden
about
six
weeks
i
wonder
we
not
seen
you
before
i
been
very
busy
with
my
work
is
this
where
you
live
yes
come
in
and
see
mother
wo
you
captain
harper
glance
swept
the
front
of
the
picturesque
little
house
and
finally
rested
on
the
patch
of
wall
where
daphne
a
bewitching
hatless
vision
with
the
sunset
gleaming
on
her
bronze
hair
stood
with
unconscious
profile
turned
towards
them
planting
snowdrop
bulbs
in
the
crannies
if
she
wo
think
i
intruding
he
replied
diffidently
but
the
boys
had
him
each
by
an
arm
and
were
hauling
him
in
by
sheer
force
mother
not
one
of
those
horrid
people
who
offer
you
two
fingers
to
shake
and
wither
you
up
just
come
and
speak
to
her
and
judge
for
yourself
holt
calls
her
the
very
soul
of
hospitality
declared
anthony
impressively
chapter
xii
lady
tracy
at
home
during
almost
the
whole
of
the
term
the
dramatic
society
had
flourished
among
the
boarders
that
is
to
say
the
prefects
had
chosen
a
play
had
taken
the
best
parts
for
themselves
and
had
allotted
the
minor
parts
to
those
girls
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
their
favourites
the
particular
piece
they
had
selected
was
named
lady
tracy
at
home
and
included
a
large
number
of
characters
many
of
these
were
only
in
the
nature
of
supers
and
had
no
words
to
say
others
had
a
few
short
speeches
all
the
main
action
of
the
play
centred
on
six
principals
who
were
represented
by
the
four
prefects
with
muriel
knighton
and
mabel
dennis
also
members
of
the
sixth
form
there
had
been
endless
rehearsals
adah
as
stage
manager
was
extremely
particular
and
drilled
her
company
remorselessly
we
got
to
make
it
a
good
show
this
time
she
assured
them
remember
we
a
big
school
now
and
we
shall
be
acting
to
a
large
audience
i
expect
those
day
girls
will
be
fairly
critical
so
we
must
give
them
any
opportunity
to
find
fault
let
show
them
we
know
how
to
act
they
used
to
have
plays
at
their
old
school
volunteered
consie
i
suppose
they
did
but
i
dare
say
they
were
up
to
much
you
see
as
they
were
boarders
they
could
have
had
proper
time
for
rehearsals
and
perhaps
did
think
out
their
costumes
as
we
doing
very
likely
they
only
took
shakespeare
or
scenes
from
dickens
or
something
tame
of
that
kind
nodded
isobel
miss
thompson
had
allowed
the
dramatic
society
a
certain
wideness
of
choice
so
they
had
abandoned
the
classics
which
seemed
to
savour
too
much
of
the
schoolroom
and
had
selected
an
entirely
modern
and
comedy
in
their
eyes
it
was
going
to
rival
a
piece
from
the
real
theatre
they
had
all
seen
acting
and
had
their
ideals
of
what
a
comedy
ought
to
be
you
must
try
to
live
in
your
parts
beforehand
so
that
you
catch
the
spirit
of
them
counselled
adah
i
heard
that
ellen
terry
and
sarah
bernhardt
always
did
that
it
was
the
secret
of
their
success
throw
yourself
into
your
character
till
you
entirely
realize
it
i
suppose
that
the
artistic
temperament
agreed
consie
it
would
be
gorgeous
to
take
up
the
stage
as
a
career
would
it
the
stage
of
the
future
is
going
to
be
a
school
of
education
for
the
people
moralized
adah
conscientious
and
cultured
actresses
will
be
a
want
miss
hopkins
says
nature
never
creates
a
vacuum
ventured
joyce
trust
mother
nature
if
there
a
want
she
send
someone
to
fill
the
gap
only
of
course
they
got
to
train
themselves
there
nothing
like
beginning
when
one
young
and
having
the
wish
is
half
the
battle
as
a
result
of
this
serious
interest
in
dramatic
culture
the
character
of
the
six
principals
underwent
sudden
and
astonishing
changes
isobel
erstwhile
a
rather
shy
and
retiring
maiden
put
on
a
perkiness
and
a
coy
assurance
very
puzzling
indeed
to
anybody
who
did
not
know
that
she
was
miss
diana
davenport
the
beautiful
dashing
fascinating
society
debutante
who
was
breaking
the
hearts
of
young
and
old
in
fashionable
mayfair
she
practised
casting
a
glamour
over
people
and
glancing
from
under
veiled
lashes
and
succeeded
fairly
well
with
those
who
understood
and
played
up
but
indifferently
with
miss
hopkins
who
asked
her
if
she
were
suffering
from
an
attack
of
indigestion
and
whether
a
dose
of
sal
volatile
would
relieve
the
pain
muriel
whose
rôle
was
that
of
diana
rejected
lover
lord
darcy
howard
went
about
endeavouring
to
remember
that
she
had
a
broken
heart
she
sighed
frequently
kept
an
expression
of
yearning
in
her
eyes
and
smiled
a
sad
wan
smile
fraught
with
memories
she
maintained
a
calm
yet
melancholy
dignity
befitting
one
who
is
singled
out
by
fate
for
disappointment
heroism
and
an
early
grave
it
was
really
a
very
difficult
part
for
muriel
whose
natural
tastes
inclined
to
a
more
sporting
character
and
she
would
have
preferred
to
act
a
comic
irish
servant
but
adah
assured
her
that
it
was
useless
to
think
of
the
stage
unless
she
was
prepared
for
all
emergencies
and
could
take
any
rôle
that
might
be
offered
her
adah
herself
as
lady
tracy
had
blossomed
into
a
loquacious
clever
manoeuvring
brilliant
hostess
much
set
on
worldly
advantages
and
immediately
concerned
with
the
due
disposal
in
life
of
her
daughter
marigold
adah
manner
had
always
been
rather
consequential
now
it
surpassed
itself
and
she
swam
about
the
school
as
queen
of
society
mabel
as
marigold
schooled
herself
to
extreme
innocence
she
would
practise
making
round
eyes
and
an
engaging
pout
as
she
lisped
out
but
mother
dearest
what
is
the
great
big
world
really
really
like
after
many
rehearsals
she
succeeded
in
sidling
bashfully
into
a
room
and
extending
a
timid
hand
without
relapsing
into
laughter
consie
the
dashing
hero
of
the
piece
had
an
easier
task
it
was
comparatively
simple
to
stride
about
paying
flowery
compliments
and
carrying
all
before
her
she
soon
acquired
an
irresistible
manner
and
a
habit
of
flinging
herself
lazily
into
and
toying
with
an
imaginary
she
succeeded
so
admirably
that
when
she
wore
her
costume
at
dress
rehearsal
some
of
the
girls
almost
fell
in
love
with
her
to
joyce
as
the
villain
fell
a
harder
lot
it
is
difficult
to
live
the
part
of
a
villain
consistently
for
weeks
at
rehearsals
much
coached
and
chivied
by
adah
she
would
slink
and
frown
and
bite
her
and
look
daggers
and
throw
sarcasm
into
her
voice
but
off
the
stage
she
would
relapse
at
once
into
the
comfortable
easygoing
ways
which
usually
characterized
her
personality
she
was
a
sore
trial
to
adah
if
you
ever
seen
or
you
have
a
better
idea
urged
the
head
girl
you
not
nearly
bold
and
bad
enough
somehow
we
give
you
a
dark
wig
and
a
curled
moustache
and
that
paper
cigar
and
you
must
grind
your
teeth
when
lord
archibald
taxes
you
with
the
conspiracy
will
the
audience
hear
me
grinding
them
asked
joyce
helplessly
of
course
not
stupid
but
they
see
your
mouth
move
if
the
moustache
does
cover
it
we
take
care
it
sha
ca
you
manage
to
look
like
jim
on
the
cinema
when
the
detective
caught
him
with
his
hand
inside
the
safe
i
try
but
how
long
must
i
go
on
looking
like
that
in
the
cinema
they
whisk
on
to
the
next
picture
in
half
a
second
but
on
the
stage
i
have
to
stand
there
and
i
do
feel
inclined
to
grind
my
teeth
for
five
minutes
i
hope
that
tweed
suit
will
fit
all
the
performers
felt
their
costumes
to
be
their
last
resource
supplying
any
deficiencies
in
the
acting
they
were
determined
to
be
and
sent
home
for
suitable
garments
adah
secured
a
perfect
dream
of
a
dress
in
grey
voile
trimmed
with
sequins
and
a
silk
petticoat
that
rustled
as
she
walked
they
lent
an
added
graciousness
and
seal
of
society
to
her
impressive
manner
isobel
borrowed
a
toque
and
a
veil
with
spots
and
a
feather
boa
and
a
pair
of
tan
boots
with
high
french
heels
and
a
large
cameo
brooch
and
a
vanity
bag
and
looked
dashing
enough
to
break
the
heart
of
the
most
hardened
and
deliberate
who
ever
trod
the
boards
her
companions
gazing
at
her
bewildered
assured
her
that
she
looked
at
least
if
not
more
the
way
she
stretched
out
a
dainty
gloved
hand
and
murmured
how
d
do
was
considered
a
triumph
of
acting
if
we
do
it
really
well
of
course
we
might
be
asked
to
give
it
over
again
adah
confided
modestly
to
her
fellows
here
asked
isobel
well
not
necessarily
sometimes
managers
lend
theatres
for
charities
an
amateur
play
generally
makes
a
heap
of
money
opined
joyce
it
would
be
lovely
to
act
it
in
a
real
theatre
gasped
mabel
the
harlingden
operatic
society
cleared
thirty
pounds
for
the
hospital
by
the
volunteered
consie
in
imagination
the
silverside
dramatic
was
already
emulating
this
gratifying
example
they
could
picture
their
appearance
on
the
boards
of
the
prince
of
wales
theatre
before
a
distinguished
audience
including
possibly
the
mayor
and
mayoress
meantime
they
expected
quite
a
crowded
audience
in
the
big
and
made
grand
preparations
the
performance
was
to
be
on
the
last
wednesday
afternoon
of
term
at
four
it
was
a
custom
as
old
as
the
school
the
day
girls
had
always
been
invited
to
attend
and
this
year
adah
pinned
up
the
usual
announcement
on
the
notice
board
she
saw
annie
and
gladys
sniggering
over
it
but
set
that
down
to
their
general
lack
of
manners
she
hoped
what
they
were
going
to
see
would
duly
impress
them
they
would
surely
be
proud
to
belong
to
a
school
that
could
get
up
such
a
dramatic
entertainment
the
performers
were
allowed
to
stop
lessons
at
in
order
to
change
their
costumes
and
after
a
tremendous
amount
of
breathless
work
in
the
way
of
dressing
accomplished
their
toilets
to
their
own
and
everybody
else
satisfaction
you
look
said
adah
to
muriel
if
you
do
absolutely
take
the
house
i
shall
be
really
astonished
lord
darcy
laughed
nervously
his
clothes
were
immaculate
but
not
very
comfortable
he
showed
decided
symptoms
of
stage
fright
joyce
as
the
wicked
earl
was
anxious
about
the
set
of
her
wig
it
was
rather
too
large
and
exhibited
a
tendency
to
tilt
over
on
one
side
unless
she
held
her
head
very
stiffly
erect
an
attitude
that
did
not
correspond
with
the
sinuous
poses
which
she
had
practised
as
appropriate
for
the
villain
of
the
piece
my
moustache
makes
my
upper
lip
quite
stiff
i
sure
i
speak
funnily
she
fluttered
no
no
you
all
right
i
tip
you
a
wink
if
your
wig
gets
crooked
and
you
can
push
it
straight
consie
you
look
an
absolute
bounder
in
that
blue
tie
if
i
were
marigold
i
should
prefer
the
villain
instead
of
falling
into
your
arms
many
thanks
said
lord
archibald
regarding
himself
in
the
mirror
with
satisfaction
as
you
to
be
my
prospective
you
ought
to
appreciate
me
better
it
high
time
we
began
urged
mabel
i
take
a
look
and
see
that
everything
ready
said
adah
she
ran
to
the
platform
and
held
a
hasty
review
of
the
stage
properties
yes
all
was
arranged
exactly
as
she
wished
minnie
and
alice
had
done
their
duty
from
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
came
the
sound
of
talking
she
could
not
resist
a
peep
at
the
audience
and
applied
her
eye
to
a
small
chink
what
she
saw
made
her
gasp
instead
of
a
whole
schoolroomful
of
people
only
the
three
front
rows
of
seats
were
occupied
much
disturbed
she
rushed
back
to
the
and
calling
mona
bardsley
who
was
acting
prompter
sent
her
off
as
scout
go
and
find
out
why
they
not
ready
and
tell
them
to
hurry
up
and
take
their
places
or
we
shall
begin
without
them
she
commanded
mona
was
away
some
little
time
she
returned
looking
decidedly
blank
they
say
they
ready
and
waiting
all
those
who
are
coming
but
the
room
only
a
quarter
full
where
are
the
others
the
day
girls
have
nearly
all
gone
home
gone
home
did
they
understand
we
invited
them
oh
yes
but
they
said
they
rather
not
stay
adah
face
was
a
study
do
you
mean
to
say
they
do
care
about
seeing
our
play
so
it
seems
the
slackers
they
just
done
it
on
purpose
out
of
spite
well
if
this
is
the
meanest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
how
perfectly
sickening
the
injured
performers
received
the
bad
news
with
much
disgust
but
their
grousing
was
cut
short
by
the
arrival
of
a
girl
with
a
message
miss
thompson
says
will
you
please
begin
at
once
because
it
getting
very
late
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
through
the
piece
with
the
best
grace
they
could
before
an
audience
of
mistresses
boarders
and
about
ten
of
the
old
silverside
day
girls
it
is
poor
work
playing
to
an
empty
house
and
they
felt
that
half
the
spirit
had
gone
out
of
the
performance
adah
manner
was
not
nearly
so
gracious
and
impressive
as
at
rehearsals
lord
darcy
got
confused
and
mixed
up
his
speeches
and
marigold
giggled
palpably
when
she
ought
to
have
been
looking
as
for
the
wicked
earl
his
black
moustache
dropped
off
just
when
he
was
in
the
very
midst
of
his
villainy
and
spoiled
his
best
point
the
principal
and
the
mistresses
clapped
their
hardest
and
so
did
the
rest
of
the
scanty
audience
but
everybody
felt
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
a
fiasco
it
was
very
nice
my
dears
said
miss
thompson
congratulating
the
disconsolate
actresses
as
they
came
in
to
tea
afterwards
quite
one
of
the
best
plays
we
ever
had
here
she
means
kindly
but
she
knows
it
was
a
failure
whispered
adah
gloomily
to
consie
i
never
forgive
those
day
girls
chapter
xiii
reports
avelyn
was
looking
forward
with
wildest
joy
to
the
christmas
holidays
there
were
so
many
things
she
intended
to
do
at
home
she
and
daphne
and
the
boys
were
all
going
to
set
to
work
to
construct
chicken
coops
in
preparation
for
the
hatching
of
clutches
of
eggs
that
would
be
put
down
in
january
then
if
the
weather
kept
open
there
were
wonderful
improvements
to
be
made
in
the
garden
stones
to
be
brought
for
a
rockery
and
ferns
to
be
fetched
from
the
stream
to
plant
upon
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
vegetable
culture
which
in
these
days
of
food
shortage
was
the
main
feature
of
their
outdoor
activities
avelyn
whole
heart
was
at
walden
she
had
grown
to
love
every
corner
of
it
with
an
intense
clinging
attachment
no
place
in
the
world
was
so
precious
as
those
few
acres
of
land
she
called
home
the
prospect
of
an
entire
glorious
month
there
filled
her
with
bliss
propose
et
dieu
dispose
however
and
our
plans
have
a
knack
of
ganging
agley
on
the
thursday
before
the
holidays
anthony
broke
out
in
spots
and
the
doctor
who
came
six
miles
in
his
car
from
the
little
town
of
roby
looked
at
them
critically
shook
his
head
and
remarked
there
a
good
deal
of
it
about
just
now
watson
was
a
woman
who
acted
promptly
when
she
had
ushered
the
doctor
out
she
tucked
up
the
invalid
warmly
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
and
went
to
the
village
where
there
was
a
public
telephone
call
office
here
she
rang
up
harlingden
and
held
a
brief
but
satisfactory
conversation
with
her
second
cousin
lascelles
then
she
went
home
wrote
a
letter
to
avelyn
and
posted
it
after
which
she
focused
her
attention
on
the
invalid
who
was
feverish
and
fractious
the
news
which
avelyn
received
in
the
letter
came
as
a
bolt
from
the
blue
i
so
sorry
darling
wrote
her
mother
but
the
doctor
says
tony
has
and
you
must
come
home
i
have
telephoned
to
cousin
lilia
and
she
offers
to
take
you
in
for
the
holidays
so
will
you
tell
miss
thompson
that
you
are
to
go
there
no
time
for
more
as
i
want
to
catch
the
early
post
darling
much
love
from
mother
avelyn
had
taken
the
letter
to
the
cowslip
room
to
read
she
put
it
in
her
pocket
sat
down
on
her
bed
and
tried
to
face
the
situation
not
to
go
home
for
the
holidays
the
idea
was
unbearable
great
tears
welled
into
her
eyes
and
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
an
absolute
baby
rebellion
raged
within
her
she
was
tempted
to
go
home
in
spite
of
her
mother
prohibition
and
beg
to
sleep
in
the
cottage
or
at
garside
farm
and
risk
the
chance
of
infection
she
would
cheerfully
catch
if
only
she
might
have
it
at
walden
a
wild
idea
struck
her
of
asking
pamela
to
take
her
in
but
the
remembrance
of
hockheimer
intervened
she
was
sure
pamela
would
not
dare
to
invite
a
visitor
to
moss
cottage
and
we
were
going
to
have
such
fun
together
she
moaned
i
hate
to
spend
the
holidays
in
town
and
at
the
lascelles
oh
it
be
grizzly
i
wish
i
could
stay
at
school
instead
i
go
home
better
reflections
however
prevailed
watson
had
brought
up
her
children
to
respect
her
authority
and
avelyn
knew
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
meet
her
mother
eyes
if
she
turned
up
at
walden
in
distinct
defiance
of
instructions
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
though
it
was
a
miserable
business
she
took
her
letter
to
miss
thompson
and
told
her
of
the
altered
arrangement
the
principal
looked
worried
i
hope
you
have
taken
the
infection
yourself
she
remarked
you
might
spread
it
over
the
school
are
you
sure
you
have
no
spots
not
a
single
one
avelyn
assured
her
well
do
mention
anything
about
it
to
the
other
girls
it
would
only
make
their
mothers
nervous
your
box
shall
be
left
in
harlingden
this
afternoon
when
the
second
batch
of
luggage
goes
i
suppose
you
can
walk
to
your
cousin
house
they
be
expecting
you
oh
yes
mother
would
tell
them
what
time
i
am
coming
avelyn
went
back
to
the
cowslip
room
and
began
to
put
her
various
possessions
into
her
box
the
packing
was
a
stale
business
without
any
heart
in
it
it
is
horrible
to
be
obliged
to
pay
a
visit
when
you
want
to
go
in
spite
of
miss
thompson
injunctions
she
could
not
help
confiding
her
ill
news
to
her
it
was
impossible
to
keep
her
woes
bottled
up
in
her
own
breast
she
wanted
sympathy
badly
hard
luck
said
laura
beastly

to
be
going

cousin
suggested
irma
this
was
a
new
view
of
the
case
that
had
not
before
occurred
to
avelyn
i
them
she
declared
i
get
cousin
lilia
to
put
me
in
an
ambulance
and
pack
me
off
home
suppose
they
would
they
might
say

too
far
and
send

fever
hospital

and
manage
to
get

by

blab
all
five
girls
were
busy
packing
their
beds
were
strewn
with
blouses
stockings
and
other
impedimenta
in
the
midst
of
the
proceedings
entered
miss
hopkins
rather
flustered
and
overdone
with
the
responsibility
of
seeing
that
boarders
took
their
essential
possessions
home
with
them
dear
me

very
slow
in
this
dormitory

observed

boxes
strapped
when
i
come
up
again
miss
hopkins
departed
to
do
her
duty
in
other
dormitories
leaving
a
sensation
as
of
east
wind
behind
her
avelyn
stood
staring
at
the
envelope
she
was
anxious
to
see
her
report
for
this
term
the
watson
family
were
lax
as
regarded
letters
at
home
they
usually
passed
round
their
correspondence
as
common
property
she
tore
open
the
envelope
therefore
and
read
the
report
it
was
quite
a
good
one
and
ended
has
done
conscientious
work
and
shows
marked
improvement
avelyn
purred
with
satisfaction
tommiekins
is
a
dear
mother
will
be
ever
so
pleased
even
hopscotch
has
given
me
which
is
more
than
i
expected
from
her
and
harrison
has
put
for
music
though
i
know
he
thinks
i
rather
a
duffer
at
it
i
wonder
what
they
said
about
me
speculated
laura
fumbling
in
her
box
for
the
envelope
which
she
had
just
packed
and
me
echoed
janet
there
is
force
in
example
in
another
moment
laura
janet
irma
and
ethelberga
were
all
perusing
their
reports
for
botany
oh
how
precious
wonders
will
never
cease
i
actually
got
for
general
knowledge
oh
hold
me
up
i
passed
muster
in
maths
what
does
miss
kennedy
mean
by
this
lacking
in
order
and
wants
more
application
i
sure
i
no
worse
than
the
rest
of
you
exclaimed
janet
indignantly
has
she
put
that
yes
i
call
it
spiteful
of
her
poor
old
sport
it
is
as
if
i
been
so
very
behindhand
all
the
term
miss
kennedy
knows
i
have
i
declare
i
shall
go
and
ask
her
what
she
means
by
it
the
offended
janet
in
a
furious
temper
flounced
out
of
the
room
in
search
of
her
form
mistress
she
found
her
in
the
study
addressing
luggage
labels
miss
kennedy
i
do
think
it
too
bad
to
give
me
such
a
horrid
report
burst
out
janet
why
am
i
specially
in
application
i
sure
i
worked
just
as
hard
as
most
of
the
other
girls
and
if
it
a
question
of
order
irma
far
more
untidy
than
i
am
and
so
is
ethelberga
i
do
call
it
fair
you
no
right
to
say
such
things
about
me
miss
kennedy
looked
up
in
extreme
astonishment
how
do
you
know
what
i
said
about
you
she
queried
why
it
here
in
black
and
white
what
paper
have
you
there
my
report
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
opened
your
report
janet
face
fell
she
shuffled
her
feet
uneasily
and
did
not
reply
it
was
addressed
to
your
father
who
authorized
you
to
open
it
i
should
like
to
know
well
avelyn
watson
read
hers
so
we
all
thought
we
could
read
ours
urged
janet
in
exculpation
indeed
miss
kennedy
tone
was
as
iced
vinegar
what
an
extremely
honourable
proceeding
miss
thompson
will
have
to
hear
of
this
something
new
in
the
school
for
girls
to
open
their
parents
letters
miss
kennedy
abandoned
the
labels
she
was
directing
and
went
at
once
in
search
of
the
head
mistress
to
whom
she
told
her
astounding
tale
miss
thompson
took
off
her
convex
glasses
wiped
them
solemnly
and
put
them
on
again
i
could
have
believed
they
would
have
she
said
with
a
note
of
battle
in
her
voice
send
avelyn
watson
to
me
i
must
deal
with
the
matter
at
once
miss
thompson
might
not
be
very
tall
but
she
was
thoroughly
capable
of
managing
her
school
every
inch
of
her
bristled
with
dignity
avelyn
entered
the
room
a
trifle
jauntily
but
one
steady
glance
from
those
convex
glasses
caused
her
feathers
to
fall
avelyn
watson
i
understand
that
half
an
hour
ago
miss
hopkins
gave
you
a
letter
addressed
to
your
mother
to
take
home
with
you
yes
miss
thompson
but
i
not
going
home
for
the
holidays
so
i
aware
in
the
circumstances
the
letter
should
have
been
posted
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
what
i
want
to
know
is
on
what
authority
you
have
presumed
to
open
it
miss
thompson
grey
eyes
were
almost
hypnotic
in
their
power
fell
before
their
keen
scrutiny
mother
always
used
to
let
me
see
my
reports
she
faltered
that
quite
a
different
matter
to
allow
you
to
look
at
what
she
had
already
seen
herself
to
open
a
letter
addressed
to
anyone
else
without
permission
is
one
of
the
most
dishonourable
things
that
anybody
can
do
no
lady
would
disgrace
herself
by
such
an
action
i
am
amazed
beyond
measure
to
find
that
any
girl
in
this
school
could
be
capable
of
it
i
thought
you
knew
our
standards
better
have
you
been
a
whole
term
here
avelyn
and
not
yet
learnt
the
very
elements
of
honour
silverside
has
always
prided
itself
upon
its
traditions
avelyn
stood
aghast
it
had
never
struck
her
that
anyone
would
construe
her
thoughtless
and
impulsive
action
in
such
a
light
she
had
no
further
excuse
to
urge
have
you
the
report
here
then
go
and
fetch
it
commanded
the
principal
avelyn
went
without
a
word
when
she
returned
and
handed
miss
thompson
the
paper
the
latter
took
out
her
stylo
and
appended
another
line
conduct
unfortunately
not
strictly
honourable
she
showed
the
addition
to
avelyn
i
am
going
to
this
to
your
mother
she
remarked
pointedly
you
may
tell
your
that
they
are
each
to
bring
me
her
report
i
shall
post
theirs
also
i
am
very
much
disappointed
in
you
all
avelyn
left
the
room
in
the
depths
of
dejection
she
had
been
very
near
tears
all
the
morning
and
now
she
could
restrain
herself
no
longer
it
seemed
an
absolutely
pixie
day
with
disgrace
on
the
top
of
bad
news
she
gave
a
husky
message
to
laura
telling
her
to
pass
it
on
to
the
others
and
then
flew
into
the
and
had
a
good
weep
in
private
crying
is
a
horrid
business
it
makes
one
head
ache
and
one
eyes
feel
bunged
up
and
one
throat
sore
and
one
heart
like
a
lump
of
lead
if
it
is
true
that
our
emotions
cause
waves
of
colour
to
emanate
from
us
poor
avelyn
aura
must
at
that
moment
have
been
a
particularly
dingy
drab
illustration
an
interview
with
miss
thompson
what
will
mother
think
of
my
getting
in
my
report
she
sobbed
and
i
ca
go
home
and
tell
her
all
about
it
i
write
to
her
and
try
to
explain
but
i
always
a
silly
at
writing
she
kept
all
our
reports
ever
since
we
first
went
to
school
and
we
none
of
us
ever
had
anything
nasty
like
this
in
them
it
just
spoil
the
record
oh
dear
what
an
idiot
i
been
i
wish
i
had
to
go
to
cousin
lilia
this
afternoon
i
know
i
hate
christmas
there
life
a
perfectly
sickening
business
chapter
xiv
war
work
after
all
avelyn
enjoyed
her
holidays
far
more
than
she
had
ever
expected
the
lascelles
gave
her
a
kind
welcome
and
tried
to
make
her
feel
at
home
they
were
quite
a
jolly
family
all
considerably
older
than
avelyn
two
sons
were
in
the
flying
corps
and
the
third
was
at
a
government
office
in
the
town
the
daughters
mary
and
gwen
were
busy
with
various
kinds
of
war
work
and
had
little
time
to
spare
they
made
a
great
effort
however
to
amuse
their
visitor
and
took
her
out
in
turns
avelyn
was
treated
to
pantomime
concerts
and
cinemas
and
was
invited
with
the
lascelles
to
many
little
parties
and
social
evenings
she
would
infinitely
rather
have
been
constructing
a
rockery
in
the
dear
walden
garden
than
sitting
in
a
picture
palace
looking
at
the
eccentricities
of
charlie
chaplin
but
she
appreciated
the
kindness
of
the
lascelles
and
felt
what
the
french
call
which
has
a
far
more
subtle
meaning
than
grateful
could
you
take
avelyn
to
the
munition
hostel
mary
said
lascelles
one
day
when
plans
for
entertaining
the
young
guest
were
running
rather
low
i
sure
bertha
gordon
would
show
you
over
the
canteen
if
you
asked
her
if
it
would
amuse
ave
began
mary
doubtfully
i
just
love
it
agreed
avelyn
brightening
perceptibly
then
i
ring
up
bertha
if
it
her
afternoon
off
i
certain
have
us
she
told
me
to
come
the
first
opportunity
i
had
and
always
seemed
too
busy
up
till
i
been
wanting
to
go
for
ever
so
long
a
brisk
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
followed
and
mary
came
back
presently
with
the
welcome
information
that
her
friend
bertha
would
be
free
from
three
till
six
and
would
be
delighted
to
see
two
visitors
and
show
them
all
in
her
power
we
get
up
there
as
early
as
we
can
said
mary
so
that
we
have
time
for
before
tea
miss
gordon
was
doing
government
war
work
in
harlingden
she
had
taken
her
certificate
for
domestic
economy
at
a
training
college
in
london
and
now
held
a
post
in
the
canteen
department
of
a
huge
munition
factory
the
place
lay
a
few
miles
out
of
the
town
mary
and
avelyn
first
caught
a
which
whisked
them
along
an
uninteresting
stretch
of
shabby
road
and
put
them
down
at
a
corner
where
three
ways
met
it
was
a
tolerably
long
walk
from
there
to
the
munition
works
the
neighbourhood
was
dingy
with
rows
of
small
cottages
and
shops
and
tall
chimneys
or
furnaces
in
the
background
the
chayton
government
factory
was
a
colony
in
itself
with
a
special
railway
line
out
from
harlingden
the
station
platform
marked
its
boundary
after
that
came
rows
and
rows
of
munition
cottages
little
wooden
houses
each
containing
three
rooms
and
a
all
exactly
similar
except
for
the
numbers
on
the
doors
the
girls
passed
these
and
went
in
the
direction
of
the
hostels
at
the
great
gate
of
the
works
stood
a
sentry
on
duty
who
asked
them
their
names
residence
and
whom
they
were
going
to
visit
and
entered
these
particulars
in
a
book
before
he
would
admit
them
it
all
right
miss
gordon
told
me
that
she
was
expecting
you
he
volunteered
as
he
opened
the
gate
for
them
feeling
rather
as
if
they
were
going
into
prison
mary
and
avelyn
stepped
forward
and
found
themselves
in
a
big
enclosure
fenced
with
barbed
wire
each
hostel
was
a
large
separate
bungalow
building
and
there
were
also
several
recreation
halls
patches
of
ground
planted
with
cabbages
lay
between
it
all
looked
very
new
and
unfinished
something
like
the
pictures
of
mushroom
cities
in
america
in
front
of
them
loomed
the
canteen
an
enormous
structure
with
a
roof
mary
enquired
at
the
office
for
miss
gordon
and
her
friend
soon
made
her
appearance
i
so
glad
you
found
your
way
here
come
in
and
i
show
you
everything
it
a
queer
place
is
it
i
should
get
lost
in
it
declared
mary
oh
it
wonderful
how
soon
you
learn
to
find
your
way
about
what
would
you
like
to
see
first
the
canteen
we
shall
just
have
time
to
go
round
before
tea
then
we
do
the
hostel
afterwards
avelyn
trotted
off
with
great
interest
in
the
wake
of
mary
lascelles
and
miss
gordon
she
was
going
to
see
a
new
side
of
life
and
learn
what
some
women
were
doing
to
help
the
war
out
at
the
front
our
boys
were
fighting
for
britain
honour
but
their
heroism
would
be
of
no
avail
if
the
hands
slacked
that
forged
the
weapons
at
home
the
workers
who
made
the
munitions
and
those
who
toiled
to
feed
the
workers
and
keep
them
fit
were
taking
their
share
of
the
burden
and
in
however
small
and
obscure
a
way
were
pushing
the
world
on
towards
the
victory
of
right
over
might
miss
gordon
first
led
the
way
into
the
canteen
an
enormous
hall
with
seats
for
three
thousand
people
there
were
long
tables
with
benches
placed
in
rows
and
over
these
hung
hostel
i
hostel
ii
hostel
iii
each
hostel
has
its
own
tables
explained
miss
gordon
and
the
girls
are
bound
to
go
there
it
saves
scrambling
they
all
have
food
coupons
and
they
take
them
to
the
counter
and
exchange
them
for
any
dishes
they
want
and
then
carry
their
plates
to
their
own
places
there
a
menu
hung
up
and
they
generally
have
the
choice
of
several
things
it
a
tremendous
sight
to
see
them
all
filing
in
for
their
meals
are
they
easily
satisfied
asked
mary
as
a
rule
but
sometimes
we
get
grumblers
and
they
inflame
the
others
you
see
there
are
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
girls
here
and
some
of
them
are
a
rough
lot
individually
they
are
quite
nice
but
when
they
get
together
in
crowds
some
spirit
of
lawlessness
seems
to
permeate
them
and
they
get
utterly
out
of
hand
sometimes
once
there
was
a
terrific
row
they
were
discontented
with
their
rations
and
they
put
the
blame
on
jennings
the
canteen
manager
some
agitators
stirred
up
trouble
and
one
evening
things
came
to
a
head
there
was
rice
pudding
for
supper
and
the
girls
did
like
rice
pudding
so
they
flung
it
all
about
the
room
and
smashed
the
plates
then
they
stood
on
the
seats
and
shouted
and
yelled
they
said
that
if
they
could
catch
the
manager
they
would
teach
him
a
lesson
he
dared
not
show
himself
indeed
he
was
obliged
to
go
away
altogether
it
was
about
two
hours
before
the
row
subsided
all
that
time
the
girls
were
shouting
in
the
canteen
they
had
utterly
lost
control
of
themselves
and
listen
to
anyone
who
tried
to
speak
to
them
we
a
new
manager
now
and
things
are
going
better
how
fearfully
exciting
commented
mary
rather
too
exciting
at
the
time
i
can
tell
you
and
the
hall
was
in
such
an
awful
mess
with
rice
pudding
flung
about
everywhere
come
into
the
kitchen
now
and
i
show
you
my
department
avelyn
had
never
seen
cooking
on
so
vast
a
scale
before
there
were
great
polished
copper
cauldrons
for
stews
so
large
that
they
looked
as
if
giant
blunderbore
meals
might
be
prepared
in
them
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
ovens
and
steamers
and
an
electric
meat
cutter
that
sliced
up
the
joints
puddings
were
being
mixed
in
big
washing
basins
and
vegetables
were
cut
up
by
a
machine
there
were
enormous
cans
of
milk
and
all
kinds
of
receptacles
for
other
stores
we
have
to
calculate
exactly
what
we
require
so
that
there
no
waste
said
miss
gordon
we
send
up
lists
every
day
and
the
lists
are
inspected
the
tea
canteen
kitchen
was
a
department
in
itself
there
were
huge
boilers
for
hot
water
rows
of
bright
copper
tea
urns
and
an
electric
cutter
for
bread
two
girls
stood
at
a
table
buttering
enormous
piles
of
slices
what
monotonous
work
remarked
avelyn
yes
it
is
rather
answered
miss
gordon
they
give
that
to
the
novices
and
pass
them
on
to
something
else
afterwards
but
one
gets
accustomed
to
all
the
work
and
does
mind
now
we
have
some
tea
ourselves
come
to
the
staff
room
i
allowed
to
bring
in
my
visitors
the
reserved
for
the
members
of
the
staff
was
divided
by
glass
doors
from
the
canteen
it
had
little
tables
and
chairs
and
its
wooden
walls
had
been
decorated
with
pictures
from
magazines
fastened
up
with
drawing
pins
some
of
the
staff
were
already
seated
there
having
tea
brisk
capable
ladies
most
of
whom
had
left
comfortable
homes
in
order
to
take
up
war
work
miss
gordon
greeted
several
friends
and
introduced
mary
and
avelyn
the
scones
and
the
oat
cake
were
delicious
and
were
certainly
a
good
advertisement
of
the
cookery
done
in
the
canteen
it
was
quite
a
merry
little
for
the
lady
workers
appeared
to
have
a
stock
of
jokes
among
themselves
now
you
must
see
my
hostel
said
miss
gordon
pushing
aside
her
cup
and
rising
when
her
guests
had
finished
if
you
seen
mine
seen
them
all
for
they
exactly
alike
the
colony
consisted
of
hostels
each
holding
a
hundred
girls
the
buildings
were
separate
bungalows
and
each
had
its
own
matron
who
was
responsible
for
the
comfort
of
its
inmates
miss
gordon
showed
mary
and
avelyn
into
her
bedroom
a
little
room
nine
feet
square
heated
by
pipes
and
containing
a
bed
chest
of
drawers
table
chair
and
cupboard
for
dresses
they
give
us
the
necessary
furniture
explained
miss
gordon
but
we
must
find
our
own
pretty
things
i
brought
the
curtains
and
the
and
cushion
and
mats
and
of
course
my
own
pictures
and
photos
there
a
good
deal
of
competition
in
making
our
rooms
nice
this
one
perfectly
sweet
exclaimed
avelyn
it
not
so
bad
and
there
quite
a
comfy
chair
to
sit
in
to
rest
and
write
letters
we
can
lock
up
our
rooms
if
we
like
the
matron
has
duplicate
keys
for
cleaning
purposes
there
was
more
to
be
seen
at
the
hostel
the
laundry
where
any
girls
who
liked
might
wash
their
own
clothes
and
where
several
were
busily
at
work
with
an
ample
supply
of
water
and
hot
irons
the
matron
little
office
with
its
piles
of
papers
neatly
filed
and
the
with
its
sacks
of
flour
sugar
rice
and
other
commodities
that
were
weighed
out
daily
and
sent
to
the
canteen
we
lack
a
cosy
said
miss
gordon
we
have
to
use
our
bedrooms
instead
there
a
recreation
hall
where
we
can
dance
in
the
evenings
if
we
wish
and
i
hope
sometime
there
going
to
be
a
library
at
present
everything
so
new
and
they
have
to
think
of
the
stern
business
part
first
before
they
give
us
luxuries
it
a
utilitarian
sort
of
life
do
you
like
it
asked
avelyn
yes
on
the
whole
very
much
it
interesting
and
i
always
enjoy
being
among
a
crowd
masses
of
people
attract
me
and
i
got
the
community
spirit
at
present
and
want
to
work
with
the
hive
avelyn
looked
thoughtful
it
was
not
the
kind
of
life
that
appealed
to
her
at
all
she
loved
nature
solitudes
and
the
companionship
of
woods
and
streams
more
than
crowds
of
people
to
live
in
a
hostel
and
canteen
would
be
absolute
purgatory
she
hoped
she
was
not
unpatriotic
then
her
face
suddenly
cleared
i
could
go
on
the
land
when
i
leave
school
she
exclaimed
with
relief
mary
lascelles
and
miss
gordon
laughed
avelyn
train
of
thought
had
been
so
evident
palpably
she
was
not
attracted
by
what
she
saw
yes
you
be
doing
your
bit
on
the
land
just
as
much
as
in
a
factory
said
miss
gordon
kindly
it
is
everybody
who
cares
to
take
up
canteen
work
let
hope
the
war
will
be
over
before
you
leave
school
you
have
several
years
more
at
your
lessons
yet
i
suppose
the
little
country
mouse
was
certainly
turned
into
a
town
mouse
for
these
christmas
holidays
avelyn
felt
that
she
had
never
before
seen
so
much
of
harlingden
even
when
she
had
lived
there
the
lascelles
were
very
people
who
were
interested
in
everything
that
was
going
on
in
the
city
and
anxious
to
lend
a
hand
in
all
schemes
for
the
general
good
they
sewed
national
costumes
for
the
serbians
rolled
bandages
at
the
war
supply
depot
distributed
dinners
at
the
municipal
kitchens
taught
gymnastic
classes
at
girls
clubs
visited
crippled
children
got
up
concerts
for
wounded
soldiers
and
organized
christmas
parties
for
slum
babies
they
seemed
to
be
occupied
nearly
every
minute
of
the
day
and
they
soon
swept
avelyn
into
the
whirl
of
the
war
activities
if
it
was
not
exactly
her
ideal
life
she
nevertheless
liked
it
and
felt
that
she
was
being
of
use
she
went
with
cousin
lilia
to
the
town
hall
and
rather
enjoyed
standing
behind
a
counter
handing
out
pies
or
ladling
soup
into
jugs
for
the
rows
of
busy
people
who
kept
pushing
in
from
the
long
queue
standing
in
the
courtyard
outside
she
admired
the
smart
quick
drill
in
mary
gymnasium
class
and
marvelled
that
the
girls
had
so
much
spirit
left
after
their
long
day
work
she
made
the
whole
of
a
serbian
child
dress
herself
with
beautiful
barbaric
trimming
on
it
she
helped
to
hand
cigarettes
round
to
the
soldiers
at
their
concert
and
she
played
blind
buff
and
drop
the
handkerchief
with
the
slum
children
at
the
new
year
party
in
the
ragged
school
she
had
an
altogether
fresh
experience
at
the
crèche
this
day
nursery
was
a
new
institution
in
harlingden
and
had
been
opened
in
order
that
women
who
wished
to
help
at
munitions
might
leave
their
babies
to
be
taken
care
of
while
they
were
at
work
gwen
lascelles
gave
two
mornings
a
week
to
it
as
a
voluntary
nurse
thereby
releasing
some
of
the
staff
to
go
off
duty
one
day
she
offered
to
take
avelyn
with
her
and
the
latter
jumped
at
the
invitation
matron
does
mind
and
you
be
a
help
said
gwen
nurse
barnes
is
away
ill
so
we
just
now
and
sometimes
it
all
i
can
do
to
manage
one
or
two
of
those
toddlers
are
the
limit
elton
lodge
had
been
lent
by
a
patriotic
citizen
for
use
as
a
day
nursery
and
was
well
adapted
for
the
purpose
it
had
plenty
of
accommodation
and
a
garden
where
the
babies
could
be
out
of
doors
in
summer
gwen
and
avelyn
arrived
here
by
ten
took
off
coats
and
hats
donned
aprons
and
entered
the
ward
this
was
a
large
light
airy
room
or
rather
two
rooms
thrown
together
at
one
end
stood
twelve
cribs
in
which
lay
twelve
babies
most
of
them
fast
asleep
at
the
other
end
grouped
round
the
high
were
sixteen
little
toddlers
of
all
ages
from
eighteen
months
to
four
years
the
nurse
in
charge
rose
with
an
air
of
relief
and
handed
over
her
duties
to
gwen
they
all
right
she
remarked
all
but
curly
who
in
a
temper
do
let
george
bully
the
others
and
smack
eddie
if
he
tries
to
unfasten
the
he
knows
what
to
expect
nurse
peters
will
be
in
the
laundry
if
you
want
her
the
nurse
made
her
escape
and
the
toddlers
came
crowding
round
gwen
clamouring
for
her
to
open
the
avelyn
strolled
across
the
room
to
inspect
the
babies
they
had
just
had
their
bottles
and
indeed
some
had
not
yet
quite
finished
and
were
sucking
away
contentedly
they
were
dear
babies
some
quite
wee
who
counted
their
ages
by
weeks
and
older
ones
with
little
tight
silky
curls
one
tearful
barefooted
person
stood
up
in
her
crib
and
held
out
a
beseeching
pair
of
arms
avelyn
could
not
resist
the
appeal
she
took
up
the
small
creature
and
cuddled
it
it
clasped
her
tightly
round
the
neck
put
a
confiding
head
on
her
shoulder
and
sobbed
gently
gwen
disengaged
herself
from
the
toddlers
and
came
across
we
really
not
supposed
to
take
them
up
and
nurse
them
she
said
but
i
own
i
break
the
rules
sometimes
poor
little
queenie
a
she
been
petted
at
home
and
has
got
used
to
crèche
ways
yet
she
soon
settle
down
look
at
arthur
is
he
splendid
when
he
first
came
he
was
simply
skin
and
bone
through
improper
feeding
his
mother
used
to
give
him
tastes
of
tea
and
red
herrings
this
is
frankie
our
special
crèche
baby
he
lives
here
altogether
his
mother
is
in
prison
for
him
poor
wee
darling
she
not
to
have
him
again
when
she
comes
out
the
judge
said
so
i
know
you
love
patty
if
she
were
awake
she
got
the
cutest
little
ways
gwen
went
round
from
cot
to
cot
performing
services
for
the
babies
restoring
a
teat
to
a
small
mouth
that
had
not
yet
finished
its
bottle
covering
cold
hands
turning
the
position
of
some
and
patting
others
who
were
inclined
to
be
fretful
and
wail
i
just
long
to
nurse
them
she
assured
avelyn
but
you
see
it
really
would
do
to
let
them
get
into
the
habit
of
thinking
that
they
must
be
taken
up
and
played
with
every
time
they
cry
do
they
howl
when
they
first
come
simply
yell
for
a
day
or
two
sometimes
we
have
to
put
them
in
the
isolation
ward
because
they
disturb
the
others
so
dreadfully
they
soon
get
accustomed
to
crèche
life
though
their
mothers
bring
them
at
about
six
in
the
morning
and
take
them
home
after
work
in
the
evening
when
they
arrive
here
they
washed
and
dressed
in
the
crèche
clothes
and
their
own
clothes
are
put
on
again
at
night
they
do
seem
shy
remarked
avelyn
who
was
still
hugging
queenie
no
that
the
best
of
them
with
seeing
so
many
nurses
and
helpers
they
go
to
anybody
they
very
sweet
when
you
may
have
them
up
and
attend
to
them
queenie
getting
sleepy
i
think
you
better
put
her
back
to
bed
avelyn
disengaged
the
clinging
little
arms
with
reluctance
she
would
cheerfully
have
acted
nurse
all
the
morning
if
allowed
she
lowered
her
sleepy
burden
into
the
crib
and
turned
her
attention
to
the
toddlers
who
certainly
needed
it
several
of
them
had
followed
gwen
and
were
popping
mischievous
fingers
through
the
bars
of
the
cribs
and
poking
the
babies
some
were
indulging
in
a
free
fight
over
a
toy
eddie
the
black
sheep
was
attempting
to
climb
the
george
was
punching
the
head
of
a
smaller
boy
and
curly
for
no
particular
reason
was
standing
with
arms
outstretched
yelling
at
the
pitch
of
his
lung
power
it
took
the
best
energies
of
the
two
young
helpers
to
restore
order
my
clothes
are
comfy
pleaded
one
small
sinner
in
a
tight
jersey
i
be
good
if
you
let
me
have
my
own
clothes
on
george
took
my
horse
i
want
a
doll
give
me
a
i
want
one
too
you
wo
get
anything
at
all
unless
you
ask
prettily
declared
gwen
sternly
where
are
your
manners
i
should
like
to
know
by
the
end
of
the
morning
avelyn
decided
that
she
could
thoroughly
sympathize
with
the
trying
experiences
of
the
old
woman
who
lived
in
a
shoe
she
felt
in
a
perfect
whirl
of
babies
they
were
sweet
little
souls
but
she
would
have
enjoyed
them
more
individually
to
wrestle
with
so
many
at
once
was
decidedly
wearing
at
twelve
came
dinner
tiny
chairs
were
placed
round
low
tables
feeders
were
tied
on
and
the
children
were
put
in
their
seats
and
taught
to
say
grace
the
nurses
brought
in
an
enormous
rice
pudding
and
gave
platefuls
to
those
who
were
old
enough
to
use
spoons
avelyn
sitting
in
a
fed
alternately
one
small
person
on
her
knee
and
another
by
her
side
gwen
was
performing
a
like
service
when
the
meal
was
at
length
over
the
toddlers
trotted
off
to
low
for
their
midday
sleep
leaving
a
blissful
calm
in
the
ward
where
the
babies
were
now
receiving
their
share
of
attention
do
you
do
this
two
mornings
a
week
asked
avelyn
as
the
girls
walked
home
yes
but
the
children
are
always
as
troublesome
as
they
were
and
if
they
get
very
bad
i
can
call
matron
or
a
nurse
i
like
just
the
babies
alone
if
there
were
the
toddlers
as
well
to
look
after
but
to
have
sixteen
of
them
to
keep
in
order
is
the
limit
i
feel
you
rather
go
on
the
land
queried
gwen
with
an
amused
smile
yes
if
i
can
choose
my
war
work
i
certainly
should
chapter
xv
the
school
birthday
when
miss
thompson
had
bought
the
connection
of
the
hawthorns
and
amalgamated
that
school
with
her
own
she
had
undertaken
a
more
difficult
task
than
she
had
altogether
anticipated
she
had
spoken
much
of
silverside
traditions
but
it
had
never
struck
her
that
the
hawthorners
might
have
some
of
their
own
to
which
they
might
cling
tenaciously
it
was
not
easy
for
the
principal
to
get
to
know
the
exact
mind
of
the
school
she
saw
the
girls
in
class
respectful
and
very
much
in
awe
of
her
but
it
was
another
matter
to
judge
the
mental
barometer
of
the
she
suspected
that
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
trouble
the
smallness
of
the
silverside
hockey
club
the
rival
stalls
at
the
bazaar
and
the
scanty
audience
at
the
dramatic
performance
had
shown
her
clearly
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
she
thought
the
matter
over
seriously
from
her
knowledge
of
girls
she
decided
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
interfere
directly
you
can
not
cause
rival
factions
to
love
each
other
by
act
of
parliament
she
trusted
that
time
and
tact
would
cement
a
union
and
meanwhile
she
meant
to
hold
her
judgment
in
the
balance
and
favour
neither
party
on
the
first
day
of
the
next
term
she
made
the
important
announcement
that
she
had
appointed
two
new
prefects
annie
broadside
and
gladys
wilks
who
would
be
given
equal
powers
with
their
it
was
a
great
step
for
the
day
girls
to
have
their
former
leaders
raised
to
a
recognized
position
in
the
school
though
they
were
only
two
as
opposed
to
four
prefects
who
were
boarders
they
could
look
after
their
own
flock
and
redress
their
grievances
adah
and
her
companions
took
the
news
badly
they
considered
that
their
old
privileges
were
being
outraged
what
miss
thompson
of
asked
consie
indignantly
she
absolutely
truckles
to
those
wretched
hawthorners
declared
isobel
will
annie
and
gladys
expect
to
come
to
our
prefects
meetings
demanded
joyce
of
course
they
will
that
the
sickening
part
of
it
said
adah
bitterly
if
miss
thompson
thinks
she
going
to
manage
us
that
way
she
mistaken
i
be
friends
with
those
hawthorners
i
wish
they
never
come
to
the
school
at
all
pretty
prefects
annie
and
gladys
will
make
sneered
joyce
to
do
annie
broadside
and
gladys
wilks
justice
they
made
excellent
prefects
they
were
the
acknowledged
leaders
of
their
own
clique
and
they
insisted
upon
certain
rules
being
obeyed
they
even
suggested
a
few
innovations
which
though
resisted
at
first
by
adah
were
afterwards
acknowledged
as
so
excellent
that
they
were
put
into
force
it
did
not
add
to
their
favour
with
the
boarders
however
to
have
the
changes
recommended
as
what
we
always
did
at
the
hawthorns
what
you
may
have
found
expedient
there
need
be
no
law
for
us
here
replied
adah
with
uplifted
eyebrows
january
was
the
school
birthday
it
was
exactly
fourteen
years
since
miss
thompson
had
first
opened
silverside
and
she
had
kept
the
anniversary
as
a
festival
ever
since
this
year
it
was
to
be
quite
a
public
occasion
the
house
was
far
too
small
for
the
increased
number
of
pupils
and
she
had
decided
to
build
on
an
annexe
consisting
of
a
large
hall
and
an
architect
had
been
busy
drawing
out
plans
but
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
getting
labour
during
the
war
the
contracts
had
only
just
been
passed
now
after
many
delays
all
was
in
training
and
the
builders
were
ready
to
begin
their
work
miss
thompson
felt
that
it
would
be
an
appropriate
act
for
the
foundation
stone
to
be
laid
on
the
school
birthday
she
was
fortunate
enough
to
persuade
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
to
come
and
perform
the
ceremony
it
was
to
be
a
great
day
at
silverside
the
girls
discussed
it
freely
beforehand
especially
the
inmates
of
the
cowslip
room
ever
so
many
smart
people
will
be
there
said
laura
delightedly
tommiekins
is
sending
out
heaps
of
invitations
i
know
because
miss
kennedy
told
consie
and
consie
told
nita
paget
the
bishop
will
make
a
speech
and
what
are
going
to
do
stand
round
and
listen
and
look
intelligent
and
appreciative
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
suppose
we
have
to
be
saints
during
the
ceremony
but
we
have
some
fun
afterwards
know
the
school
to
be
thrown
open
to
all
sorts
of
visitors
not
only
old
fogies
who
make
speeches
but
other
people
the
day
girls
may
each
ask
three
friends
and
they
can
bring
brothers
if
they
like
you
do
say
so
miss
thompson
coming
on
are
you
certain
it
quite
true
confirmed
avelyn
i
was
allowed
an
invitation
card
too
and
i
asked
mother
and
daphne
and
david
and
i
got
pamela
to
ask
anthony
with
one
of
her
spare
invitations
what
sport
we
all
have
to
wear
our
best
dresses
said
janet
rather
you
bet
we
do
in
preparation
for
the
coming
event
a
wave
of
what
miss
hopkins
would
have
dubbed
worldliness
swept
over
the
cowslip
room
the
girls
reviewed
their
frocks
critically
laura
implored
miss
kennedy
to
allow
hers
to
be
sent
to
the
dressmaker
to
be
lengthened
two
inches
janet
borrowed
the
last
drops
of
ethelberga
bottle
of
benzoline
to
remove
a
stain
left
by
the
dropping
down
of
a
piece
of
muffin
avelyn
brushed
her
hair
every
night
with
eau
de
cologne
to
make
it
glossy
ethelberga
in
defiance
of
food
saving
begged
oatmeal
from
the
cook
and
rubbed
it
on
her
face
to
improve
her
complexion
irma
after
criticizing
the
costumes
of
her
friends
sprang
a
surprise
on
them
i
sent
home
for
a
new
dress
she
announced
carelessly
you
have
yes
i
have
and
what
more
i
expect
it
mother
wrote
that
she
was
telling
barclays
to
post
it
to
me
direct
well
i
do
think
you
might
have
told
us
before
the
other
girls
felt
as
if
irma
had
stolen
an
advantage
if
the
idea
had
occurred
to
them
they
might
also
have
written
home
for
new
dresses
it
was
unfortunately
too
late
now
irma
alone
of
the
cowslip
room
would
attend
the
festival
in
the
glory
of
a
new
gown
she
gave
herself
airs
in
consequence
it
was
an
unfortunate
characteristic
of
irma
that
she
was
apt
to
get
swelled
head
on
occasion
her
were
constantly
on
the
for
symptoms
of
this
complaint
and
generally
applied
drastic
measures
before
things
went
too
far
in
a
dormitory
it
does
not
do
to
allow
a
girl
to
maintain
too
exalted
an
opinion
of
herself
irma
swanking
no
end
affirmed
ethelberga
putting
on
side
galore
agreed
janet
tartly
we
ought
to
do
something
to
take
the
wind
out
of
her
sails
a
little
said
laura
looking
pensive
avelyn
eyes
suddenly
sparkled
i
got
it
she
chuckled
we
play
a
rag
on
her
this
afternoon
it
be
ever
such
fun
oh
i
thought
of
a
perfectly
gorgeous
plan
no
i
do
think
i
tell
you
what
it
is
yet
but
stroll
up
to
the
dormitory
as
soon
after
four
as
you
can
and
make
irma
come
too
on
some
excuse
then
i
have
a
little
surprise
for
you
you
might
tell
us
no
no
not
a
word
it
would
spoil
the
surprise
the
members
of
the
cowslip
room
were
always
ready
for
some
diversion
they
wondered
what
kind
of
a
practical
joke
avelyn
was
going
to
play
on
irma
they
took
particular
care
to
decoy
their
victim
upstairs
at
four
as
a
bait
ethelberga
offered
to
lend
irma
her
manicure
set
they
were
rubbing
pink
powder
on
irma
nails
when
a
rap
came
at
the
door
entrez
shouted
janet
casually
it
was
a
junior
who
made
her
appearance
carrying
a
large
parcel
this
has
just
come
and
it
for
your
room
so
i
brought
it
up
she
announced
dumping
it
down
on
the
bed
and
leaning
over
to
read
the
address
miss
irma
ridley
wish
it
had
been
miss
dorothy
elston
no
luck
and
she
waved
a
rather
impertinent
hand
and
trotted
away
irma
jumped
up
upsetting
the
box
of
manicure
powder
and
scattering
the
other
implements
over
the
floor
it
never
my
box
she
exclaimed
at
that
psychological
moment
avelyn
entered
the
room
i
did
expect
it
until
rejoiced
irma
they
must
have
sent
it
by
carrier
instead
of
by
post
lend
me
your
scissors
janet
oh
i
just
dying
to
look
the
parcel
was
a
large
cardboard
box
done
up
in
rather
untidy
brown
paper
it
had
evidently
suffered
considerably
on
the
journey
irma
cut
the
string
with
the
utmost
haste
and
began
to
tear
off
the
wrappers
and
open
the
box
i
know
mother
will
have
chosen
me
something
pretty
she
purred
mother
got
such
lovely
taste
and
she
wrote
that
she
seen
the
very
thing
and
was
sure
i
should
like
it
it
well
wrapped
up
remarked
janet
irma
was
removing
sheet
after
sheet
of
tissue
paper
with
a
pleased
giggle
at
last
she
reached
the
core
of
the
package
and
unfolded
not
a
smart
new
frock
but
her
own
ordinary
school
evening
dress
her
stare
of
blank
astonishment
was
comical
what
this
what
have
they
sent
me
she
gasped
but
her
were
collapsing
in
various
attitudes
of
mirth
and
she
understood
for
a
moment
two
red
spots
flared
in
her
cheeks
then
she
had
the
sense
to
take
the
joke
with
a
good
grace
if
she
was
angry
the
others
should
have
the
triumph
of
seeing
her
annoyance
you
geese
she
remarked
i
might
have
known
the
box
could
arrive
so
this
is
why
you
hauled
me
upstairs
is
it
oh
go
on
and
laugh
if
you
like
it
does
hurt
me
i
do
mind
she
hung
the
dress
up
again
in
her
wardrobe
and
folding
the
sheets
of
tissue
paper
appropriated
them
i
been
wanting
some
tissue
paper
she
said
airily
the
girls
restrained
themselves
and
sobered
down
you
a
trump
irma
declared
avelyn
it
was
too
bad
but
we
could
help
laughing
murmured
janet
poor
old
irmie
you
took
it
sporting
sympathized
ethelberga
you
like
your
dress
all
the
more
when
it
really
comes
comforted
laura
when
irma
parcel
arrived
the
next
day
her
having
played
their
joke
upon
her
had
the
grace
to
be
nice
and
to
admire
the
new
frock
which
was
a
charming
creation
in
blue
and
suited
its
owner
admirably
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
be
pleasant
about
it
and
avelyn
lent
a
hair
ribbon
which
exactly
matched
the
shade
of
colour
while
laura
offered
a
chain
of
venetian
beads
they
all
felt
as
they
dressed
for
the
festival
that
if
irma
costume
eclipsed
the
rest
of
them
she
deserved
her
little
triumph
for
keeping
her
temper
it
a
shame
to
have
to
put
a
coat
over
it
said
ethelberga
well
she
certainly
ca
stand
outside
in
the
cold
with
only
that
thin
dress
on
decreed
laura
the
ceremony
was
to
take
place
at
three
and
shortly
before
that
hour
all
the
school
in
hats
and
coats
were
marshalled
outside
to
the
spot
where
the
new
hall
was
to
be
erected
it
was
a
cold
grey
january
afternoon
with
one
or
two
snowflakes
floating
down
and
everybody
stood
and
shivered
some
of
the
invited
guests
were
keeping
warm
in
the
house
and
others
strolled
out
to
the
scene
of
action
the
girls
drawn
up
in
line
nodded
and
smiled
to
many
friends
from
the
town
they
were
cold
and
impatient
for
the
proceedings
to
begin
waiting
is
weary
work
on
a
january
afternoon
their
talk
which
at
first
had
been
low
and
subdued
began
to
buzz
and
rose
higher
and
higher
what
a
disgraceful
noise
said
adah
it
all
those
wretched
hawthorners
if
miss
thompson
brings
out
the
bishop
while
all
this
clamour
is
going
on
she
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
the
school
less
noise
girls
do
you
hear
the
girls
heard
perfectly
well
but
they
did
not
heed
and
the
hum
of
unrestrained
conversation
continued
adah
waxed
desperate
this
ca
go
on
it
must
she
said
indignantly
she
thought
for
a
moment
then
took
an
extreme
measure
she
walked
up
to
annie
broadside
and
confronted
her
with
flashing
eyes
you
a
prefect
if
you
any
influence
with
your
old
crew
why
you
stop
this
din
it
a
disgrace
to
silverside
i
said
what
i
can
annie
looked
astonished
but
for
once
she
fell
in
with
the
head
suggestion
passing
along
the
lines
she
commanded
silence
and
she
was
obeyed
where
adah
had
failed
to
restore
order
she
succeeded
at
that
moment
the
house
door
opened
and
miss
thompson
appeared
ushering
out
the
bishop
a
reverend
figure
in
gaiters
and
followed
by
the
mistresses
and
a
number
of
guests
a
dead
hush
fell
upon
the
school
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
at
attention
the
little
ceremony
was
not
very
long
perhaps
the
bishop
himself
felt
the
cold
there
were
one
or
two
brief
speeches
and
edna
esdale
the
youngest
member
of
form
i
handed
a
trowel
decorated
with
ribbons
a
dab
of
mortar
was
deposited
and
the
foundation
stone
laid
the
girls
sang
god
save
the
king
then
as
the
snow
was
beginning
to
come
down
in
good
earnest
everybody
thankfully
turned
into
the
house
it
was
certainly
a
crowd
but
it
was
pleasant
to
meet
friends
the
watson
family
had
all
turned
up
and
had
actually
brought
reynolds
with
them
to
pamela
great
triumph
for
as
a
rule
her
mother
shunned
all
public
gatherings
the
poor
lady
though
very
nervous
seemed
to
be
mildly
enjoying
herself
i
am
glad
pam
did
ask
her
uncle
thought
avelyn
i
should
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
insisted
on
coming
there
was
actually
a
birthday
cake
for
the
school
with
fourteen
little
candles
on
it
and
the
bishop
at
miss
thompson
request
cut
the
first
slice
there
was
only
enough
for
visitors
but
the
girls
had
had
the
satisfaction
of
viewing
it
lighted
beforehand
and
had
known
that
it
was
not
big
enough
to
go
round
so
consequently
were
not
disappointed
irma
in
her
new
blue
dress
produced
quite
a
sensation
among
those
of
her
form
who
had
not
yet
seen
its
beauties
its
attractions
even
went
further
miss
thompson
ciceroning
the
bishop
round
the
premises
and
expatiating
on
the
value
of
her
new
scheme
of
ventilation
let
her
eyes
pass
over
a
line
of
girls
flattening
themselves
dutifully
against
the
wall
and
singled
out
the
creation
in
blue
we
many
nice
children
here
come
here
irma
dear
this
one
is
irma
ridley
run
child
and
fetch
me
your
nature
notebook
i
should
like
the
bishop
to
look
at
it
we
make
a
point
of
nature
study
my
lord
irma
departed
on
her
errand
like
a
blue
sunbeam
she
stood
smiling
and
speechless
while
the
great
church
dignitary
benevolently
examined
her
record
of
the
months
and
murmured
his
approval
miss
thompson
says
it
all
went
off
splendidly
declared
janet
as
the
girls
warmed
themselves
at
the
fire
afterwards
david
and
anthony
called
it
affirmed
avelyn
and
was
introduced
to
the
lord
bishop
of
howchester
triumphed
irma
with
the
glamour
of
the
honour
still
dancing
in
her
shining
eyes
chapter
xvi
under
the
pines
when
spring
came
bringing
daffodils
in
the
orchard
and
primrose
stars
under
the
alder
bushes
in
the
meadow
and
tiny
green
shoots
on
the
hedges
and
singing
of
larks
and
cawing
of
jackdaws
and
twitter
of
linnets
and
all
the
other
dear
delights
of
the
return
of
proserpine
walden
also
celebrated
a
birthday
it
was
a
year
since
the
watsons
had
obtained
possession
of
their
little
property
to
them
all
it
had
been
a
glad
golden
glorious
year
full
of
fresh
interests
new
awakenings
and
hitherto
experiences
they
had
been
living
spiritually
on
a
far
higher
plane
almost
unconsciously
the
influence
of
hills
and
wide
skies
and
dashing
waters
had
passed
into
their
lives
and
widened
them
so
much
of
what
we
are
in
our
after
years
depends
on
the
standard
of
happiness
we
form
when
we
are
quite
young
if
we
learn
to
take
nature
hand
and
read
in
her
book
she
can
teach
us
wonderful
secrets
and
lift
our
souls
so
that
we
can
never
again
be
really
narrow
or
vulgar
or
petty
or
commonplace
it
is
not
the
mere
fact
of
living
in
the
country
that
gives
this
inner
vision
too
often
country
dwellers
go
about
with
closed
eyes
and
sealed
hearts
to
the
meaning
of
the
beauty
around
them
but
to
those
who
will
listen
to
mother
nature
many
voices
there
comes
a
wonderful
refinement
and
purity
of
taste
quite
irrespective
of
wealth
or
class
distinctions
the
mark
of
the
spirit
that
is
daily
growing
overmastering
the
claims
of
the
physical
body
and
fitting
itself
for
something
that
as
yet
we
only
grasp
at
but
can
not
reach
god
must
love
his
children
very
dearly
to
send
them
such
beautiful
things
as
the
april
sunshine
and
the
light
on
the
hills
and
the
white
spray
of
the
whirling
waterfall
and
the
violets
in
the
hazel
coppice
they
may
spoil
his
earth
for
themselves
but
the
springtime
comes
again
and
the
little
heartsease
flowers
will
bloom
not
only
over
those
graves
in
france
but
over
deeper
graves
of
fallen
hopes
and
lost
ideals
watson
reviewed
the
year
at
walden
as
so
much
gain
to
begin
with
her
primary
object
in
the
removal
had
been
an
entire
success
daphne
formerly
pale
thin
and
an
object
for
anxiety
was
now
as
radiant
as
a
daisy
and
pronounced
by
the
specialist
to
be
absolutely
fit
and
sound
she
spent
most
of
her
time
out
of
doors
gardening
and
looking
after
her
colony
of
fowls
and
though
she
might
not
be
doing
definite
war
work
felt
that
she
was
helping
her
country
by
the
production
of
daphne
had
suddenly
grown
very
pretty
avelyn
who
often
looked
at
her
critically
decided
that
point
emphatically
it
was
a
delicate
ethereal
elusive
kind
of
beauty
due
as
much
to
expression
as
to
straight
features
and
smiling
grey
eyes
daphne
never
came
out
well
in
a
photograph
that
was
quite
a
recognized
fact
in
the
family
to
appreciate
her
you
had
to
see
her
when
she
was
excited
or
gardening
with
her
hair
rumpled
the
walden
birthday
fell
early
in
april
and
the
watsons
decided
to
celebrate
it
by
having
a
saturday
picnic
captain
harper
promised
to
join
them
he
came
up
sometimes
from
the
camp
to
lyngates
and
they
also
asked
pamela
and
her
mother
rather
to
their
surprise
reynolds
accepted
the
invitation
the
poor
lady
was
still
somewhat
crushed
and
depressed
but
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
bestir
herself
and
for
her
daughter
sake
to
make
faint
almost
pathetic
efforts
at
friendship
she
was
shy
and
uncommunicative
but
she
evidently
liked
watson
and
would
cheer
up
a
little
in
her
presence
and
venture
a
few
remarks
and
even
a
watery
smile
the
picnic
was
to
be
in
the
pine
woods
so
all
met
at
the
by
the
pond
as
a
common
and
set
forth
together
armed
with
tea
baskets
it
was
a
walk
up
hill
along
a
road
that
twisted
at
sharp
angles
and
gave
lovely
views
of
the
landscape
below
presently
they
reached
the
beginnings
of
the
wood
and
some
pines
rose
like
giant
sentinels
guarding
an
enchanted
land
as
they
tramped
on
the
trees
stood
thicker
tall
and
straight
as
the
masts
of
a
ship
with
a
carpet
of
soft
fallen
needles
underneath
all
at
once
a
gleam
of
water
flashed
and
they
had
reached
the
bourne
of
their
journey
a
little
grey
lake
set
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
with
heather
and
whinberry
growing
round
its
banks
there
was
a
space
of
shingle
down
by
the
water
and
here
after
a
grand
hunt
to
collect
sticks
they
lighted
a
fire
and
boiled
the
kettle
they
had
brought
with
them
it
was
fun
sitting
round
in
a
gipsy
circle
even
if
the
tea
was
rather
weak
and
smoky
and
the
war
cake
was
conspicuous
by
its
lack
of
sugar
and
currants
everybody
could
have
eaten
a
great
deal
more
than
the
ration
and
the
provisions
disappeared
down
to
the
very
last
crumb
afterwards
the
young
folks
started
to
explore
the
banks
and
had
a
wild
time
scrambling
over
fallen
tree
trunks
jumping
small
streams
and
pushing
through
thickets
at
a
particularly
large
fallen
pine
avelyn
struck
and
demanded
a
rest
she
and
pamela
perched
themselves
on
the
top
and
announced
their
intention
of
sitting
still
for
at
least
ten
minutes
the
boys
who
had
been
cutting
from
the
hazels
by
the
lake
edge
consented
to
a
halt
and
settled
down
with
their
penknives
whittling
away
busily
watson
and
reynolds
were
washing
up
the
at
the
picnic
place
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
echoed
faintly
over
the
water
daphne
and
captain
harper
seemed
temporarily
lost
it
like
home
to
be
right
amongst
the
pines
said
pamela
looking
with
eyes
at
the
vista
of
trunks
and
green
needles
did
you
live
among
them
in
america
asked
avelyn
yes
our
ranch
was
out
in
british
columbia
close
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
at
one
time
daddy
had
lumbering
business
there
and
we
spent
the
summer
at
a
log
shanty
right
up
on
the
mountain
it
was
glorious
and
i
loved
it
but
it
was
very
lonely
daddy
used
to
be
out
all
day
looking
after
the
timber
and
mother
and
i
would
be
left
by
ourselves
until
evening
sometimes
we
did
see
anyone
except
our
own
family
for
weeks
and
weeks
were
you
frightened
only
once
and
then
we
really
had
an
adventure
i
was
more
scared
when
it
was
over
than
at
the
time
do
tell
us
about
it
pleaded
avelyn
pamela
hesitated
and
threw
pine
cones
into
the
lake
she
had
never
been
very
expansive
about
her
life
in
canada
and
the
watsons
had
heard
few
of
her
experiences
there
they
had
a
general
impression
that
reynolds
had
not
prospered
in
the
new
world
and
that
pamela
shrank
from
letting
her
friends
know
the
roughness
of
her
early
upbringing
as
a
rule
they
refrained
from
questioning
her
she
was
not
a
girl
whom
it
was
easy
to
question
but
an
adventure
could
not
be
resisted
do
tell
us
pam
urged
the
boys
wriggling
nearer
and
stopping
their
whittling
pamela
threw
away
all
the
pine
cones
that
lay
in
her
lap
seemed
to
think
a
moment
or
two
then
finally
decided
all
right
i
tell
you
if
you
like
well
as
i
just
said
we
were
living
in
a
in
a
little
clearing
in
the
forest
we
used
to
hear
the
coyotes
howling
about
at
night
but
we
did
mind
those
in
the
least
they
cowardly
beasts
and
we
never
seen
anything
else
to
frighten
us
one
day
father
had
a
much
longer
round
to
go
than
usual
and
he
said
he
should
not
be
back
at
night
but
would
sleep
with
some
friends
at
a
ranch
a
good
many
miles
off
mother
and
i
did
not
mind
being
left
daddy
had
been
obliged
to
stop
away
like
that
before
so
we
were
accustomed
to
it
i
went
out
in
the
afternoon
across
the
clearing
and
through
part
of
the
forest
to
some
open
pastures
where
the
berries
grew
i
stayed
there
picking
some
and
eating
them
and
putting
some
in
my
basket
for
just
ages
it
was
nice
there
i
found
flowers
as
well
as
berries
and
i
brought
out
a
book
with
me
so
i
sat
down
and
read
and
enjoyed
myself
suddenly
i
noticed
that
the
sun
was
beginning
to
set
and
i
jumped
up
and
felt
guilty
i
knew
that
mother
would
have
supper
ready
and
that
she
be
waiting
for
me
i
ran
home
all
the
way
it
was
getting
quite
dusk
in
the
forest
as
i
went
through
when
i
came
near
the
house
i
could
see
that
the
shutters
were
up
covering
the
window
that
did
surprise
me
because
mother
generally
closed
them
as
soon
as
she
lighted
the
lamp
but
she
always
left
the
door
standing
open
for
me
and
the
door
was
shut
too
i
was
rushing
forward
to
open
it
when
i
heard
mother
voice
calling
me
stop
do
come
a
step
nearer
child
i
looked
round
to
see
where
mother
was
and
she
was
in
the
funniest
place
our
had
a
loft
above
it
which
was
reached
by
a
ladder
from
the
this
loft
had
a
tiny
window
in
the
roof
and
lo
and
behold
there
was
mother
peeping
out
of
the
window
and
waving
me
back
i
thought
it
so
funny
that
i
began
to
laugh
but
mother
laughing
at
all
she
called
out
again
back
her
voice
sounded
so
queer
that
it
suddenly
scared
me
my
legs
began
to
shake
in
the
silliest
way
the
matter
i
shouted
mother
voice
quavered
a
little
be
too
frightened
darling
there
a
puma
shut
up
in
the
house
i
was
fearfully
frightened
all
the
same
i
should
have
run
away
if
mother
had
not
been
at
the
window
i
stared
at
the
house
picturing
that
horrible
thing
moving
about
inside
mother
went
on
explaining
lighted
the
lamp
and
closed
the
shutters
and
i
left
the
door
open
for
you
then
suddenly
i
saw
the
creature
creep
into
the
room
my
first
idea
was
that
it
would
rush
out
and
catch
you
just
as
you
were
coming
home
so
i
slammed
the
door
and
dashed
up
the
ladder
into
the
loft
and
then
kicked
the
ladder
away
he
downstairs
quite
safe
and
i
up
here
and
he
ca
get
at
me
i
put
down
the
you
crawl
through
the
window
mummie
i
gasped
it
too
small
i
tried
i
caged
up
here
just
as
much
as
the
puma
is
caged
down
below
and
i
can
hear
him
raging
about
if
he
upsets
the
lamp
the
whole
place
will
be
on
fire
i
gave
a
great
cry
at
that
because
it
seemed
almost
a
certain
thing
that
the
puma
would
upset
the
lamp
and
then
i
knew
the
would
be
in
a
blaze
what
could
i
do
daddy
would
not
be
returning
home
that
night
and
our
nearest
neighbours
were
miles
away
yet
i
must
get
help
and
at
once
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
every
minute
was
of
consequence
go
to
the
petersons
ranch
mummie
i
shouted
and
i
started
off
running
without
waiting
for
her
to
reply
i
was
only
eleven
and
the
forest
was
getting
dark
i
had
never
been
out
alone
in
it
at
that
time
of
evening
i
was
brave
at
all
my
legs
shook
under
me
as
i
ran
and
i
imagined
a
puma
behind
every
bush
then
i
was
rather
uncertain
about
the
trail
in
that
dim
light
it
would
be
very
easy
to
lose
my
way
and
never
reach
the
ranch
at
all
i
decided
to
keep
near
the
stream
which
would
guide
me
i
went
stumbling
on
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
and
everything
was
getting
darker
when
suddenly
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
i
saw
the
light
of
a
camp
fire
i
knew
some
lumbermen
must
be
spending
the
night
in
the
woods
there
and
that
they
might
help
me
i
hallooed
and
cooeed
as
loudly
as
i
could
but
the
wind
was
in
the
wrong
direction
and
carried
my
voice
away
and
the
stream
was
noisy
so
i
could
make
them
hear
me
i
did
know
what
to
do
then
a
little
farther
down
i
saw
that
a
tree
had
fallen
across
the
stream
i
ran
along
and
looked
at
it
it
was
a
horrible
bridge
i
a
coward
at
crossing
water
but
i
had
to
crawl
over
it
somehow
for
a
year
afterwards
i
used
to
dream
that
i
was
doing
it
again
and
would
wake
up
gasping
i
hated
running
water
ever
since
well
i
managed
to
get
across
though
i
never
quite
knew
how
i
did
it
and
then
i
ran
up
to
the
camp
fire
shaking
so
that
i
could
hardly
tell
what
i
wanted
three
men
were
sitting
there
cooking
their
supper
and
one
of
them
called
out
what
up
with
you
young
when
i
said
there
was
a
puma
inside
our
house
they
all
whistled
then
the
one
who
had
spoken
reached
for
his
gun
and
said
come
with
you
lassie
the
others
did
say
anything
but
they
got
up
and
found
their
guns
too
one
of
them
took
me
on
his
back
and
carried
me
across
the
bridge
when
he
saw
how
i
funked
it
he
went
over
without
minding
it
in
the
least
i
do
know
how
he
could
it
was
fearfully
dark
going
home
through
the
wood
and
i
could
only
just
manage
to
find
the
trail
we
got
to
our
shanty
at
last
and
i
shouted
and
mother
looked
out
of
the
window
and
said
god
back
safe
the
three
men
talked
over
the
best
way
of
killing
the
puma
one
of
them
prised
open
the
shutters
and
the
other
two
stood
ready
with
their
guns
the
creature
had
been
quiet
so
mother
told
us
afterwards
for
a
long
while
but
when
the
shutters
fell
back
it
went
wild
and
came
tearing
across
the
room
to
the
window
knocking
over
the
table
and
upsetting
the
lamp
it
was
shot
directly
and
fell
dead
inside
the
room
but
the
lamp
had
broken
and
set
up
a
blaze
the
men
rushed
to
our
shed
for
spades
and
threw
earth
on
the
burning
paraffin
managing
to
put
the
fire
out
before
any
real
damage
had
been
done
then
they
fixed
the
ladder
again
and
mother
came
down
from
the
loft
when
daddy
came
home
next
day
she
said
she
dare
be
left
alone
in
the
woods
again
so
he
took
us
to
the
settlement
and
we
lived
there
the
rest
of
the
summer
did
you
keep
the
puma
skin
asked
anthony
who
had
followed
the
story
with
breathless
interest
no
i
have
liked
to
but
the
lumbermen
had
dragged
the
thing
outside
and
the
coyotes
got
hold
of
it
in
the
night
so
there
was
much
skin
left
by
morning
i
think
you
were
immensely
plucky
exclaimed
avelyn
warmly
plucky
what
else
could
i
have
done
i
tell
you
i
felt
the
biggest
coward
out
chapter
xvii
the
lavender
lady
it
was
easter
time
when
the
lavender
lady
first
rose
upon
the
horizon
of
lyngates
she
came
with
the
dog
violets
and
the
ground
ivy
and
the
meadow
orchises
and
several
other
lovely
purple
things
at
least
that
was
how
her
advent
was
always
associated
in
avelyn
mind
she
took
the
furnished
bungalow
near
the
church
lately
vacated
by
the
curate
and
it
was
rumoured
in
the
village
that
she
composed
music
and
had
published
poetry
and
that
she
had
come
down
into
the
country
for
a
rest
when
avelyn
first
saw
her
she
was
sitting
in
the
flowery
little
garden
raised
above
the
road
she
wore
a
soft
lavender
dress
and
an
old
lace
fichu
and
she
had
dark
eyes
and
eyebrows
and
cheeks
as
pink
as
the
china
roses
and
fluffy
hair
that
gleamed
like
a
dove
wing
as
the
sun
shone
on
it
she
looked
such
a
picture
as
she
sat
there
all
unconscious
of
spectators
against
a
background
of
golden
wallflowers
and
violet
aubrietias
that
avelyn
was
obliged
just
to
stand
still
and
gaze
in
that
thirty
seconds
she
fell
in
love
with
the
lavender
lady
it
was
not
a
mere
mild
liking
but
a
sudden
romantic
absolute
headlong
falling
in
love
it
had
come
all
in
a
minute
and
overwhelmed
her
she
crept
away
softly
to
dream
dreams
about
the
vision
she
had
seen
in
the
garden
at
home
there
were
some
beautiful
illustrated
editions
of
william
morris
and
of
dante
gabriel
poems
she
took
them
out
and
pored
over
them
the
gorgeous
pictures
had
always
appealed
to
her
innate
artistic
sense
and
set
her
nerves
athrill
with
a
something
she
could
not
analyse
there
was
not
one
of
them
so
beautiful
as
her
lavender
lady
among
the
flowers
she
a
little
like
blessed
damozel
who
leaned
out
the
gold
bar
of
heaven
mused
avelyn
and
then
again
she
like
gainsborough
picture
of
duchess
of
devonshire
i
wonder
what
her
name
is
and
if
i
shall
ever
know
her
i
do
believe
i
dare
to
speak
to
her
i
be
too
shy
for
a
whole
week
avelyn
terribly
in
love
lived
in
a
mystic
world
in
which
the
lavender
lady
robed
in
the
glory
of
the
purple
night
and
stars
was
as
the
central
sun
and
she
herself
revolved
like
a
planet
round
her
orbit
the
family
could
not
understand
why
she
insisted
upon
choosing
heliotrope
for
her
new
dress
it
wo
suit
you
dear
demurred
watson
bewildered
by
the
firmness
of
her
daughter
sudden
attitude
they
were
sitting
round
the
table
with
three
boxes
of
patterns
from
london
firms
spread
out
temptingly
before
them
you
of
all
people
in
helio
ave
objected
daphne
it
the
one
colour
you
ought
never
to
wear
you
far
too
much
of
a
brunette
for
any
violet
shades
you
look
nice
in
this
biscuit
or
this
saxe
blue
i
always
liked
you
in
that
blue
dress
you
had
a
couple
of
years
ago
there
a
perfectly
charming
stripe
here
recommended
watson
i
want
the
helio
please
said
avelyn
doggedly
but
should
you
want
helio
when
you
know
it
does
suit
you
stormed
daphne
it
really
only
because
happened
to
say
so
you
ca
see
yourself
in
your
own
dress
if
you
could
you
choose
another
colour
you
know
nothing
about
it
retorted
avelyn
and
matters
nearly
grew
warm
between
the
two
girls
there
no
need
to
send
the
patterns
back
interrupted
watson
sweeping
the
whole
consignment
back
into
their
boxes
bring
them
out
and
talk
about
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
sent
for
the
biscuit
shade
without
consulting
avelyn
again
much
to
the
disgust
of
that
damsel
who
consoled
herself
by
taking
energetically
to
gardening
and
replanting
the
round
border
in
the
middle
with
wallflowers
and
purple
aubrietias
it
was
the
easter
holidays
so
she
had
time
to
dream
she
made
up
at
least
six
romances
about
the
lavender
lady
past
some
of
them
ended
happily
and
some
unhappily
she
could
not
decide
which
was
really
the
more
artistic
she
walked
past
the
cottage
every
evening
once
she
threw
a
bunch
of
violets
over
the
wall
just
to
the
place
where
the
lady
had
been
sitting
then
she
ran
away
frightened
at
her
own
daring
another
evening
as
she
passed
she
heard
the
strains
of
a
piano
and
the
sound
of
a
rich
sweet
contralto
voice
she
stood
and
listened
spellbound
it
was
a
song
she
had
never
heard
before
a
lovely
crooning
song
like
a
cradle
lullaby
she
would
have
liked
to
stay
and
listen
to
more
but
the
vicar
wife
and
daughters
were
coming
down
the
road
and
she
fled
somehow
she
did
not
want
to
be
talked
to
just
at
that
moment
on
sunday
she
chivied
the
family
off
to
church
at
least
ten
minutes
too
soon
and
they
sat
in
their
pew
in
stately
dignity
while
the
rest
of
the
congregation
trickled
in
avelyn
from
a
post
of
vantage
near
the
pillar
eyed
everyone
that
entered
with
increasing
disappointment
then
her
heart
gave
a
great
thump
her
lady
was
coming
up
the
aisle
not
in
lavender
this
time
but
in
black
and
white
with
a
bunch
of
violets
and
a
big
trimmed
with
silver
ribbon
and
a
white
ostrich
boa
and
dainty
white
kid
gloves
the
verger
was
showing
her
to
a
seat
in
front
actually
the
next
pew
but
one
and
avelyn
felt
thrills
running
down
her
spine
she
was
so
glad
the
verger
had
selected
a
pew
in
front
if
it
had
been
behind
she
would
have
been
absolutely
obliged
to
disgrace
herself
by
turning
round
after
the
service
she
managed
to
drop
her
book
and
to
fumble
for
it
long
enough
to
delay
her
family
for
a
few
moments
and
prevent
them
from
leaving
before
the
lavender
lady
they
passed
her
in
the
churchyard
she
was
actually
speaking
to
the
eldest
daughter
avelyn
decided
that
barbara
holt
had
more
than
her
share
of
luck
at
over
the
joint
of
roast
beef
watson
remarked
that
seems
a
sweet
lady
staying
at
the
bungalow
miss
carrington
i
hear
her
name
is
she
comes
from
london
and
holt
says
she
very
musical
i
think
i
shall
have
to
call
avelyn
went
on
eating
beef
and
potatoes
with
a
jumping
heart
but
outward
composure
it
had
not
struck
her
that
it
was
possible
to
pay
social
calls
on
dante
gabriel
rossetti
heroines
what
if
she
were
to
meet
the
lavender
lady
at
close
quarters
even
speak
to
her
the
idea
seemed
to
need
preparation
watson
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
daphne
and
i
will
go
on
tuesday
she
said
it
was
of
course
appropriate
that
daphne
being
the
eldest
should
go
but
avelyn
envied
her
all
the
same
when
the
momentous
afternoon
arrived
she
enquired
anxiously
what
her
sister
was
going
to
wear
it
seemed
vitally
important
that
the
family
should
make
a
good
impression
you
put
on
your
grey
coat
and
skirt
wo
you
she
said
beseechingly
i
do
think
i
will
i
really
do
want
to
go
at
all
yawned
daphne
not
want
to
go
avelyn
could
hardly
believe
it
she
stared
at
daphne
incredulously
do
you
feel
well
she
asked
oh
yes
it
is
that
but
i
hate
paying
calls
and
i
promised
the
boys
to
walk
to
fulverton
captain
harper
said
he
meet
us
and
show
us
a
squirrel
nest
he
found
suppose
you
go
and
call
with
mother
instead
of
me
avelyn
gasped
such
unselfishness
took
away
her
breath
do
you
really
mean
you
let
me
go
instead
of
you
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
child
if
you
want
to
daphne
manner
was
airy
and
of
course
it
nothing
to
me
whether
we
meet
captain
harper
or
not
only
he
made
rather
a
point
about
it
and
perhaps
it
would
seem
well
rude
if
i
let
the
boys
go
without
me
been
very
kind
to
david
and
tony
and
one
does
like
to
hurt
his
feelings
two
things
swept
across
avelyn
bewildered
consciousness
first
that
daphne
was
growing
up
growing
up
most
suddenly
and
unmistakably
and
secondly
that
she
had
resigned
her
privilege
as
elder
daughter
to
call
on
the
lavender
lady
the
first
would
have
to
be
considered
at
leisure
in
all
its
bearings
and
side
issues
the
second
was
for
the
moment
uppermost
go
and
ask
mother
what
you
to
put
on
said
daphne
as
if
the
whole
question
of
the
exchange
were
settled
it
was
an
outwardly
calm
and
but
inwardly
avelyn
who
entered
in
her
mother
wake
into
the
little
at
the
bungalow
one
comprehensive
glance
took
in
the
fact
that
the
room
was
utterly
different
from
what
it
had
been
during
the
occupation
there
were
books
and
flowers
and
other
pretty
things
about
the
general
tone
had
changed
from
commonplace
to
artistic
on
the
lay
a
sketch
of
the
village
there
was
music
on
the
open
piano
but
these
details
faded
into
secondary
consideration
for
the
lavender
lady
was
entering
in
the
soft
heliotrope
gown
with
a
sprig
of
wallflower
pinned
into
the
lace
fichu
occasionally
in
our
lives
we
meet
with
people
whose
whole
electric
atmosphere
seems
to
merge
and
blend
with
our
own
we
feel
we
are
not
so
much
making
a
new
acquaintance
as
picking
up
the
lost
threads
of
some
former
avelyn
experienced
thrills
as
she
shook
hands
she
was
far
too
shy
to
say
much
but
she
sat
and
listened
rapturously
while
her
mother
and
miss
carrington
did
the
talking
for
the
present
it
was
enough
to
be
in
the
vicinity
of
her
goddess
the
maid
brought
in
tea
there
were
a
dainty
teneriffe
cloth
queen
anne
silver
teapot
and
apostle
teaspoons
and
scones
and
honey
a
bowl
of
primroses
and
was
on
the
table
the
visit
passed
like
a
dream
you
come
and
see
me
again
dear
wo
you
said
miss
carrington
as
she
held
avelyn
hand
in
the
hot
colour
flooded
the
girl
face
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
oh
may
i
she
cried
impulsively
that
afternoon
marked
an
epoch
friendship
is
a
matter
more
of
temperament
than
of
years
that
the
lavender
lady
was
and
avelyn
barely
sixteen
made
not
the
slightest
difference
to
either
of
them
each
character
comfortably
into
the
other
miss
carrington
had
a
great
sympathy
for
girls
and
she
seemed
to
understand
avelyn
at
once
as
for
the
latter
she
had
utterly
lost
her
heart
but
for
the
fear
of
making
herself
a
nuisance
she
would
have
nearly
lived
at
the
bungalow
she
went
there
very
often
by
special
invitation
and
spent
glorious
delightful
afternoons
sitting
in
the
garden
talking
about
art
and
books
and
music
and
the
foreign
places
miss
carrington
had
visited
it
fascinated
avelyn
to
hear
about
venice
and
rome
and
sicily
and
egypt
and
made
her
long
to
go
and
see
them
for
herself
you
shall
some
day
when
the
war
over
said
the
lavender
lady
confidently
sometimes
they
would
go
for
walks
together
or
avelyn
would
wait
with
a
book
while
miss
carrington
sketched
or
what
she
loved
immensely
would
sit
in
the
twilight
while
her
friend
improvised
soft
dreamy
music
at
the
piano
the
little
volume
of
poems
by
lesbia
carrington
she
already
knew
almost
by
heart
the
small
edition
with
its
signed
autograph
was
her
greatest
treasure
to
avelyn
it
was
a
most
inspiring
friendship
that
roused
dormant
hopes
and
ideals
in
her
nature
which
promised
to
make
rapid
growth
afterwards
her
lavender
lady
proved
the
most
delightful
of
confidantes
it
was
possible
to
tell
her
everything
she
never
laughed
at
avelyn
secrets
though
she
was
merry
enough
on
occasion
one
evening
she
and
avelyn
sat
in
the
little
garden
watching
the
red
glow
of
the
setting
sun
fade
away
behind
the
dark
boughs
of
the
yew
trees
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
flowers
from
the
fields
came
the
caw
of
rooks
as
long
flights
passed
homeward
to
roost
avelyn
squatted
on
the
grass
with
her
head
against
the
lavender
lady
knee
and
held
her
hand
tight
next
week
i
shall
be
back
at
silverside
she
whispered
i
just
hate
the
thought
of
it
poor
little
woman
it
is
as
nice
there
as
it
ought
to
be
somehow
things
seem
always
at
sixes
and
sevens
and
it
so
horrid
what
the
trouble
the
old
school
and
the
new
school
wo
mix
the
silversiders
look
down
on
the
hawthorners
and
the
hawthorners
resent
it
of
course
and
just
detest
the
silversiders
it
a
constant
bickering
the
whole
time
i
think
it
almost
worse
since
annie
and
gladys
were
made
prefects
perfectly
wretched
for
me
because
i
between
two
stools
how
that
well
you
see
in
a
way
i
a
boarder
but
then
i
the
only
weekly
boarder
so
the
others
who
stay
there
the
whole
term
rub
it
into
me
that
i
not
quite
one
of
themselves
they
ca
forget
that
i
used
once
to
go
to
the
hawthorns
even
though
it
a
long
time
ago
and
they
keep
bringing
it
up
against
me
as
if
i
were
a
sort
of
traitor
in
their
midst
then
it
quite
as
awkward
for
me
with
the
day
girls
i
like
some
of
them
very
much
they
used
to
be
old
chums
of
mine
and
i
like
to
go
on
being
friends
with
them
but
if
i
even
speak
to
them
in
school
laura
or
janet
are
down
on
me
like
anything
and
ask
me
if
i
forgotten
i
a
member
of
the
silverside
league
what
is
the
league
please
it
a
kind
of
among
the
boarders
to
keep
up
silverside
traditions
when
the
day
girls
heard
of
it
they
started
an
hawthorners
league
in
opposition
but
surely
you
all
silversiders
now
we
are
in
name
but
nothing
else
we
still
feel
two
separate
schools
the
day
girls
would
play
hockey
with
us
in
the
winter
they
got
up
a
club
of
their
own
and
wore
their
old
school
colours
they
won
ever
so
many
matches
and
the
silverside
club
did
so
badly
adah
was
dreadfully
sick
about
it
she
thought
them
so
mean
to
desert
perhaps
they
felt
they
would
be
welcome
that
exactly
the
point
instead
of
pulling
together
it
always
boarders
versus
day
girls
and
as
for
poor
little
me
i
neither
fish
flesh
fowl
nor
good
red
herring
the
lavender
lady
smiled
and
then
looked
thoughtful
she
stroked
avelyn
hair
poor
little
woman
she
said
again
i
feel
like
mohammed
coffin
slung
between
earth
and
heaven
ca
something
be
done
to
bring
these
rival
factions
into
harmony
you
one
school
now
and
ought
to
work
together
for
the
common
good
that
what
miss
thompson
says
but
it
does
make
any
difference
girls
often
wo
listen
to
teachers
the
movement
must
come
from
within
not
without
it
seems
to
me
ave
you
the
one
to
set
it
in
motion
i
avelyn
turned
up
her
face
in
the
greatest
amazement
to
meet
the
lavender
lady
calm
eyes
yes
darling
do
you
see
you
have
an
absolutely
unique
opportunity
you
the
only
girl
in
the
school
who
is
in
touch
with
both
sides
you
can
get
at
both
the
boarders
and
the
day
girls
the
hockey
season
is
over
and
i
suppose
next
term
you
be
starting
tennis
and
cricket
yes
so
we
shall
well
suppose
directly
you
get
back
to
harlingden
you
propose
a
united
league
of
all
silversiders
to
win
credit
for
the
school
you
could
set
about
it
very
tactfully
and
sound
your
principal
parties
first
but
they
think
it
such
cheek
a
fifth
form
girl
and
only
a
weekly
boarder
illustration
avelyn
and
the
lavender
lady
and
gideon
said
shall
i
save
israel
i
am
the
least
in
my
father
house
quoted
miss
carrington
on
the
contrary
i
think
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
i
believe
you
the
one
girl
to
do
it
it
would
be
something
worth
accomplishing
would
it
to
unite
the
school
rather
is
there
any
public
occasion
when
you
could
bring
forward
the
suggestion
yes
there
the
school
council
on
the
first
wednesday
of
term
anybody
is
allowed
to
put
things
to
the
meeting
and
votes
are
taken
you
could
have
a
better
opportunity
talk
in
private
to
the
girls
first
and
persuade
a
number
of
them
from
both
sides
to
be
ready
to
back
you
up
then
state
your
proposal
by
the
by
what
are
the
silverside
colours
and
navy
and
the
old
hawthorn
colours
navy
and
pink
if
you
wise
you
amalgamate
them
and
ask
miss
thompson
to
let
you
have
new
badges
of
pink
and
navy
i
believe
it
might
just
make
all
the
difference
to
the
state
of
feeling
perhaps
you
right
but
i
still
feel
afraid
it
a
big
thing
to
attempt
and
i
do
know
whether
i
can
screw
up
the
courage
suppose
i
fail
suppose
they
only
laugh
at
me
and
tell
me
to
mind
my
own
business
you
wo
fail
you
must
failure
make
up
your
mind
beforehand
that
you
going
to
succeed
and
that
what
you
say
will
persuade
them
oh
ave
darling
do
try
it
would
be
such
a
grand
thing
there
are
those
two
great
streams
of
girls
each
running
its
own
way
they
only
need
a
thin
barrier
removed
to
make
them
into
one
mighty
river
some
common
purpose
should
unite
them
perhaps
in
their
heart
of
hearts
they
all
secretly
longing
for
union
who
knows
ca
your
hands
lead
them
together
you
said
once
you
do
anything
for
my
sake
so
i
did
and
i
mean
it
then
take
up
this
crusade
and
be
a
red
cross
knight
for
the
school
colours
for
the
school
colours
and
for
you
dear
lavender
lady
said
avelyn
kissing
the
soft
hand
in
token
of
her
vow
chapter
xviii
the
loyal
school
league
avelyn
went
back
to
school
in
a
serious
frame
of
mind
she
knew
that
she
had
undertaken
a
big
thing
and
though
she
mentally
set
her
teeth
and
meant
to
grapple
with
it
she
felt
that
her
dear
lavender
lady
did
not
could
not
realize
all
the
difficulties
that
lay
in
her
path
miss
carrington
supreme
faith
in
her
buoyed
her
up
however
she
would
try
her
utmost
and
if
failure
came
no
the
lavender
lady
had
said
it
was
fatal
even
to
mention
failure
and
that
she
must
go
about
her
errand
absolutely
determined
to
succeed
she
began
by
sounding
the
members
of
her
own
dormitory
they
received
the
suggestion
with
wonderful
favour
the
school
been
slack
enough
at
games
all
the
winter
commented
irma
time
it
bucked
up
certainly
agreed
janet
that
hawthorners
hockey
club
was
a
scandal
said
laura
well
if
we
do
take
care
they
be
turning
it
into
a
tennis
club
for
the
summer
warned
avelyn
we
better
make
some
sort
of
a
move
grunted
ethelberga
it
adah
that
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
trouble
said
laura
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
arms
clasped
round
her
knees
and
swaying
thoughtfully
to
and
fro
adah
a
thorough
silversider
and
hates
the
new
contingent
that
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
isobel
and
consie
and
even
joyce
would
come
round
directly
if
adah
would
only
let
them
agreed
irma
and
annie
and
gladys
would
meet
them
nodded
janet
adah
the
most
ripping
i
know
ruminated
laura
and
so
annie
she
won
the
trophy
last
year
at
the
hawthorns
the
two
together
would
make
the
best
champions
any
school
ever
had
well
look
here
they
just
to
go
together
i
an
idea
a
brain
wave
said
avelyn
the
council
meeting
will
be
well
this
afternoon
let
us
propose
a
tennis
set
versus
mistresses
miss
peters
and
miss
broadwin
are
simply
at
tennis
and
everybody
knows
they
are
so
we
insist
upon
adah
and
annie
playing
together
for
the
school
they
ca
refuse
when
it
put
like
that
whether
they
win
or
lose
it
pave
the
way
for
what
we
want
to
bring
forward
right
you
are
o
queen
it
a
blossomy
idea
avelyn
got
up
and
straightened
her
tie
i
go
down
now
to
the
and
catch
those
day
girls
as
they
come
in
and
have
a
talk
with
some
of
them
and
i
go
and
sound
miss
peters
about
the
set
this
afternoon
in
a
good
temper
because
she
had
a
letter
from
the
front
miss
peters
and
miss
broadwin
fresh
and
fit
after
the
holidays
were
quite
disposed
to
accept
the
challenge
of
the
girls
and
wield
rackets
on
behalf
of
the
mistresses
universal
public
opinion
fixed
upon
adah
and
annie
as
champions
for
the
school
and
they
submitted
a
little
bewildered
and
dismayed
but
bowled
over
by
the
suddenness
of
the
suggestion
every
girl
at
silverside
except
three
victims
who
had
music
lessons
and
one
who
had
toothache
crowded
round
the
tennis
court
to
watch
the
exciting
contest
miss
peters
and
miss
broadwin
were
formidable
opponents
they
had
been
members
of
their
college
clubs
and
though
slightly
out
of
practice
had
not
forgotten
their
former
skill
the
two
prefects
knew
that
it
would
need
their
utmost
ability
to
fight
them
with
the
whole
school
looking
on
each
nerved
herself
to
do
her
best
in
the
first
game
the
mistresses
scored
miss
peters
serves
seemed
almost
invincible
and
as
for
miss
broadwin
her
arms
were
elastic
adah
and
annie
looked
at
each
other
grimly
they
had
begun
to
take
their
opponents
measure
and
also
to
estimate
each
other
play
in
the
next
game
they
exercised
extreme
caution
and
did
not
repeat
certain
mistakes
after
an
exciting
rally
the
score
this
time
fell
to
the
school
now
for
the
tussle
laughed
miss
peters
as
she
collected
balls
adah
could
not
help
admiring
the
way
annie
played
that
last
game
she
kept
her
nerve
splendidly
and
her
strokes
were
magnificent
for
an
anxious
moment
or
two
the
luck
of
the
school
trembled
in
the
balance
but
by
a
frantic
effort
on
the
part
of
the
prefects
the
set
was
secured
the
vanquished
mistresses
took
their
defeat
sportingly
and
congratulated
the
victors
one
of
the
best
sets
we
ever
had
at
silverside
declared
miss
broadwin
pinning
up
a
tail
of
hair
that
had
strayed
down
her
back
in
the
heat
of
the
combat
if
you
two
go
on
like
this
you
be
invincible
laughed
miss
peters
you
need
to
get
a
little
more
accustomed
to
each
other
play
and
you
make
splendid
champions
you
were
both
absolutely
topping
declared
the
school
crowding
round
adah
took
her
honours
stolidly
but
appreciated
them
none
the
less
after
all
it
was
pleasant
to
be
congratulated
by
the
day
girls
it
made
up
in
some
slight
degree
for
the
humiliation
of
that
afternoon
when
they
had
run
away
rather
than
witness
the
dramatic
performance
we
must
practise
together
she
said
to
annie
and
annie
actually
replied
i
could
stay
half
an
hour
every
day
after
school
if
you
like
this
amnesty
between
the
rivals
heard
and
reported
by
several
listeners
surely
seemed
to
pave
the
way
for
tomorrow
proposals
avelyn
mental
barometer
stood
at
high
hopes
the
council
meeting
was
always
held
in
the
big
schoolroom
and
by
rule
classes
stopped
at
instead
of
so
as
to
allow
extra
time
for
the
proceedings
no
mistresses
were
present
and
the
girls
within
certain
limits
were
allowed
to
make
any
arrangements
they
thought
fit
for
the
ensuing
term
the
prefects
took
their
places
on
the
platform
and
adah
as
head
girl
acted
chairman
the
room
was
very
full
on
the
front
benches
sat
rows
of
youngsters
in
the
prevailing
fashion
for
socks
with
their
hair
tied
with
broad
ribbons
behind
them
were
excitable
juniors
wriggling
restlessly
in
their
seats
and
continually
letting
their
whispers
rise
to
a
murmur
that
called
down
rebuke
from
the
platform
these
were
as
sheep
ready
to
follow
any
leader
and
did
not
understand
the
objects
of
the
meeting
they
had
come
simply
because
they
were
told
to
do
so
and
because
they
thought
it
would
be
fun
the
larger
half
of
the
school
girls
from
twelve
to
seventeen
were
in
a
state
of
indecision
it
had
been
rumoured
that
annie
broadside
intended
to
turn
the
old
hawthorners
hockey
club
into
a
tennis
club
for
the
summer
and
there
was
in
certain
quarters
a
strong
feeling
that
they
ought
to
support
her
they
wondered
what
was
going
to
happen
avelyn
with
laura
janet
irma
ethelberga
pamela
and
several
other
backers
sat
at
the
end
underneath
the
clock
adah
began
the
proceedings
by
reading
a
report
of
the
school
activities
for
the
previous
term
she
made
the
very
best
of
what
she
had
to
say
but
it
was
felt
to
be
a
poor
record
the
societies
and
guilds
had
been
decidedly
languishing
and
had
achieved
next
to
nothing
it
was
impossible
to
refer
to
them
with
any
pride
there
was
perfunctory
clapping
markedly
now
we
got
to
decide
on
what
we
going
to
do
this
term
continued
adah
i
suppose
we
shall
have
our
usual
societies
the
tennis
club
and
the
cricket
club
and
the
photographic
union
if
anybody
wants
to
make
any
suggestions
now
is
the
time
this
is
an
open
meeting
and
everyone
who
likes
is
at
liberty
to
speak
in
turn
of
course
there
may
be
some
little
points
you
like
to
bring
up
do
so
by
all
means
we
prefects
are
perfectly
willing
to
listen
to
you
and
to
discuss
them
adah
spoke
in
her
usual
rather
patronizing
fashion
her
words
were
succeeded
by
a
dead
hush
everybody
felt
that
there
were
not
only
little
points
but
very
big
points
which
needed
to
be
raised
yet
nobody
seemed
able
to
voice
the
general
discontent
a
whisper
passed
along
some
of
the
forms
to
the
effect
that
day
girls
ought
to
have
their
rights
adah
watched
the
heads
bent
together
and
the
moving
lips
speak
to
the
chair
please
she
reminded
them
but
at
that
they
sat
up
silently
many
of
the
audience
wondered
if
annie
would
take
up
the
cudgels
for
the
day
girls
and
fight
the
question
out
upon
the
platform
but
annie
made
no
sign
was
she
thinking
of
the
old
hawthorners
league
and
would
she
perhaps
again
call
a
rival
meeting
on
the
common
as
she
had
done
in
the
autumn
am
i
to
take
it
that
you
consider
former
arrangements
satisfactory
asked
adah
frowning
at
some
of
the
babies
who
were
playing
with
a
celluloid
ball
then
avelyn
stood
up
i
should
like
very
much
to
discuss
one
or
two
points
if
i
may
she
began
certainly
go
on
well
first
of
all
i
think
we
ought
all
to
be
rather
ashamed
of
the
report
for
such
a
big
school
i
certainly
think
we
ought
to
have
far
more
to
show
for
ourselves
several
of
the
prefects
nodded
and
began
to
look
interested
there
are
nearly
a
hundred
girls
here
this
term
and
we
may
call
ourselves
the
principal
school
in
harlingden
we
ought
to
take
quite
a
place
in
the
county
and
challenge
other
schools
for
matches
we
shone
very
much
in
games
hitherto
have
we
a
discontented
murmur
replied
from
the
benches
there
was
an
electric
thrill
in
the
air
avelyn
took
courage
at
first
her
sentences
had
come
hesitatingly
now
that
she
warmed
to
her
subject
her
words
flowed
more
easily
she
had
a
sudden
feeling
that
the
lavender
lady
was
thinking
of
her
and
inspiring
her
the
idea
roused
the
utmost
effort
of
which
she
was
capable
she
determined
to
speak
boldly
and
not
beat
about
the
bush
if
she
gave
offence
she
could
not
help
it
what
we
want
here
is
a
spirit
of
union
if
we
all
determine
to
stick
together
and
back
one
another
up
at
all
costs
we
might
do
great
things
do
let
us
have
two
parties
let
us
forget
any
old
squabbles
and
be
loyal
to
the
school
i
believe
we
heaps
of
talent
amongst
us
if
it
only
gets
a
chance
to
come
out
let
remodel
our
societies
on
a
new
basis
and
give
the
best
places
to
whoever
will
gain
the
most
credit
for
the
school
why
should
we
try
this
year
for
the
county
shield
with
two
such
champions
as
adah
gartley
and
annie
broadside
we
ought
to
have
a
sporting
chance
just
think
if
we
could
win
the
shield
for
silverside
then
there
cricket
we
can
muster
up
strongly
in
that
respect
too
joyce
edwards
and
minnie
selburn
and
gladys
wilks
and
maggie
stuart
would
take
a
good
deal
of
beating
we
could
get
up
a
eleven
and
arrange
some
topping
matches
think
how
priceless
it
would
be
to
go
and
watch
them
and
cheer
on
our
own
side
avelyn
paused
for
breath
she
had
spoken
warmly
and
the
excitement
had
quite
carried
her
away
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
shining
she
had
held
the
attention
of
the
room
with
a
kind
of
magnetism
all
faces
had
been
turned
towards
her
and
her
every
word
had
been
closely
followed
the
girls
now
burst
into
a
buzz
of
general
conversation
each
wanted
to
discuss
the
matter
with
her
neighbour
it
was
plain
that
the
project
was
received
with
approval
even
the
prefects
were
having
a
few
private
remarks
among
themselves
joyce
and
isobel
in
particular
were
nodding
emphatically
as
if
urging
the
project
upon
adah
annie
whispered
to
gladys
and
they
both
spoke
to
consie
all
were
looking
expectantly
towards
adah
the
head
girl
rang
the
bell
for
silence
what
you
say
is
very
true
silverside
ought
to
take
its
proper
place
in
games
and
i
think
we
all
agree
that
a
special
effort
should
be
made
this
summer
as
this
is
a
business
meeting
will
you
please
put
what
you
wish
to
suggest
in
the
form
of
a
proposition
certainly
i
beg
to
propose
that
we
form
a
school
league
the
object
of
which
shall
be
to
advance
in
every
way
the
credit
of
silverside
we
ought
to
have
a
president
and
several
and
a
committee
with
two
representatives
from
each
of
the
upper
forms
if
any
very
important
question
arises
we
should
have
a
council
meeting
of
the
whole
school
and
put
the
matter
to
the
vote
i
also
propose
that
for
the
sake
of
further
cementing
our
unity
we
adopt
a
new
badge
and
have
for
our
colours
pink
and
navy
it
would
be
an
effective
combination
and
would
mean
a
good
deal
to
most
of
us
we
would
pledge
ourselves
to
do
our
utmost
for
the
new
silverside
colours
as
avelyn
again
stopped
a
roar
of
applause
rose
from
the
room
the
girls
were
completely
carried
away
by
her
idea
the
blending
of
the
badges
seemed
the
one
thing
needed
to
unite
the
school
though
a
few
prejudiced
old
silversiders
including
adah
looked
rather
blank
the
majority
even
among
the
boarders
were
plainly
in
favour
of
the
suggested
change
does
anybody
second
this
proposition
asked
the
head
girl
we
prefects
want
to
hear
the
view
of
the
school
a
dozen
stood
up
anxious
to
speak
adah
nodded
to
laura
talbot
laura
had
been
at
silverside
five
years
and
was
a
dependable
character
not
easily
carried
away
by
tides
of
emotion
her
ideas
might
reasonably
be
the
gauge
of
average
popular
opinion
i
been
thinking
for
a
long
time
that
we
ought
to
do
something
said
laura
it
seems
to
me
that
a
school
league
just
hits
the
nail
i
believe
we
forge
ahead
this
term
and
win
laurels
for
our
new
colours
i
have
very
great
pleasure
in
seconding
this
proposition
then
i
put
it
to
the
vote
all
in
favour
kindly
hold
up
their
hands
every
arm
in
the
room
shot
up
instantly
adah
looked
at
the
waving
show
of
hands
before
her
and
realized
that
the
general
feeling
of
the
school
favoured
unity
she
had
the
sense
to
accept
the
situation
in
a
generous
spirit
carried
unanimously
she
declared
and
turning
round
smiled
at
annie
who
smiled
back
the
girls
cheered
ostensibly
at
the
carrying
of
the
resolution
but
partly
to
see
the
rival
leaders
on
such
affable
terms
we
want
a
president
and
i
propose
adah
shouted
ethelberga
and
the
rest
of
the
prefects
as
amended
janet
hear
hear
came
from
the
audience
and
i
said
pamela
jumping
up
suddenly
beg
to
propose
that
avelyn
who
suggested
the
whole
idea
of
the
league
shall
be
elected
secretary
rather
good
biz
ave
by
all
means
oh
no
please
i
do
want
to
grab
any
office
for
myself
protested
avelyn
nonsense
brace
up
child
for
you
have
to
do
it
urged
laura
why
you
brought
about
the
whole
business
besides
you
belong
to
both
parties
so
you
bind
us
together
as
nobody
else
could
the
missing
link
in
fact
hinnied
irma
trying
to
be
funny
the
meeting
passed
the
remaining
resolutions
in
good
order
then
broke
up
in
a
whirl
of
excited
talk
a
deputation
of
prefects
visited
miss
thompson
study
and
gave
her
a
digest
of
the
afternoon
proceedings
she
listened
approvingly
i
order
the
new
badges
at
once
and
see
about
hiring
a
larger
cricket
field
she
commented
the
principal
did
not
judge
it
discreet
to
say
more
to
the
girls
but
over
cocoa
that
evening
with
the
mistresses
she
voiced
her
satisfaction
i
knew
they
come
round
in
time
if
we
let
them
alone
you
ca
force
these
things
i
suppose
it
was
only
natural
that
the
old
school
and
the
new
should
find
some
difficulty
in
mingling
girls
are
queer
creatures
and
often
very
prejudiced
it
wo
have
done
them
any
harm
to
see
what
a
poor
record
they
made
in
games
when
they
were
striving
for
rival
factions
i
consider
it
an
excellent
object
lesson
i
expect
they
all
try
their
best
now
and
practise
away
hard
at
cricket
and
tennis
i
hoped
it
marked
a
new
era
when
i
saw
adah
and
annie
win
that
set
at
tennis
nodded
miss
peters
they
both
excellent
girls
in
their
way
and
should
do
great
things
for
the
school
if
they
only
pull
together
agreed
miss
hopkins
avelyn
spent
her
of
leisure
that
evening
in
writing
to
miss
carrington
darling
lavender
lady
i
have
actually
done
it
or
rather
have
done
it
for
it
was
entirely
your
idea
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
is
true
but
the
league
is
an
accomplished
fact
and
the
new
colours
and
all
your
dear
jinky
suggestions
i
do
know
how
i
had
the
cheek
to
stand
on
my
legs
and
make
the
proposal
before
the
whole
school
but
i
thought
of
my
promise
to
you
and
i
did
it
somehow
i
hardly
remember
what
i
said
the
girls
are
tremendously
keen
on
the
league
they
say
it
a
topping
notion
can
you
believe
it
darling
they
made
me
secretary
little
me
i
shall
have
to
write
the
letters
to
other
schools
challenging
them
to
matches
i
shall
use
the
lovely
new
blotter
you
gave
me
and
thank
you
a
hundred
thousand
times
for
everything
you
are
to
me
with
love
from
your
devoted
avelyn
chapter
xix
the
surprise
tree
having
once
made
up
their
minds
to
concentrate
their
united
energies
on
establishing
a
record
at
games
the
girls
at
silverside
set
to
work
in
dead
earnest
they
organized
definite
and
systematic
practice
both
at
cricket
and
tennis
and
tried
to
bring
their
play
to
a
higher
standard
they
found
much
help
in
this
respect
from
miss
peters
and
miss
leslie
who
had
come
as
new
mistresses
in
september
and
were
keen
on
tennis
and
cricket
during
the
winter
there
had
been
no
opportunity
for
them
to
display
their
talents
but
now
they
proved
invaluable
as
coaches
both
had
been
in
large
schools
and
thoroughly
understood
what
was
required
they
encouraged
the
girls
to
arrange
matches
it
worth
it
even
if
you
beaten
said
miss
leslie
you
see
other
people
play
and
learn
to
make
a
good
fight
you
can
often
pick
up
most
valuable
hints
from
your
opponents
some
of
the
best
tips
i
ever
had
i
got
from
a
girl
who
invariably
beat
me
it
was
quite
a
novel
state
of
affairs
at
silverside
for
day
pupils
to
stay
after
four
and
join
the
boarders
in
tennis
court
or
cricket
field
but
after
the
first
week
the
latter
got
used
to
the
invasion
of
their
privileges
and
decided
that
the
improvement
in
the
general
play
was
ample
compensation
the
new
badges
soon
arrived
and
everybody
decided
that
the
combination
of
pink
and
navy
was
highly
satisfactory
the
loyal
school
league
seemed
likely
to
forge
ahead
avelyn
made
a
capital
secretary
she
was
prompt
and
and
though
she
did
not
push
herself
forward
unduly
she
was
always
ready
with
helpful
suggestions
at
one
of
the
committee
meetings
she
started
the
idea
of
the
romp
day
it
was
the
lavender
lady
who
really
thought
of
it
she
inspired
all
avelyn
best
schemes
they
had
talked
it
over
and
planned
it
out
in
the
little
garden
at
lyngates
where
roses
were
now
blooming
instead
of
the
wallflowers
and
aubrietia
i
glad
the
league
prospering
she
had
said
it
splendid
how
you
all
working
together
now
and
coaching
each
other
it
a
pity
though
if
all
this
new
spirit
of
helpfulness
spends
itself
entirely
on
the
school
it
ought
to
find
a
wider
outlet
you
having
jolly
times
in
the
playing
fields
this
term
ca
you
pass
on
some
of
the
fun
to
others
who
never
get
a
chance
to
play
games
for
themselves
i
mean
the
little
cripple
children
there
a
branch
of
the
brave
society
in
harlingden
if
miss
thompson
would
let
you
give
them
an
afternoon
outing
they
have
the
time
of
their
lives
could
you
possibly
suggest
it
do
you
think
i
really
believe
it
the
sort
of
thing
silverside
would
enjoy
the
league
and
miss
thompson
justified
the
lavender
lady
good
opinion
of
them
they
took
up
the
idea
with
enthusiasm
and
decided
to
organize
a
romp
day
for
the
crippled
children
they
communicated
with
the
secretary
of
the
poor
brave
things
society
with
the
result
that
invitations
were
sent
out
to
thirty
little
invalids
to
come
to
a
picnic
party
in
the
garden
at
silverside
and
be
entertained
a
special
was
given
for
the
occasion
and
all
the
school
was
asked
to
unite
in
making
the
affair
a
success
miss
thompson
wished
the
day
girls
to
stay
to
tea
that
afternoon
but
catering
was
a
difficulty
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
her
to
provide
a
meal
for
a
hundred
and
thirty
children
the
food
controller
rationed
the
school
according
to
the
number
of
its
boarders
the
principal
was
inventive
however
and
hit
on
an
excellent
solution
of
the
problem
she
asked
each
day
girl
to
bring
enough
tea
sugar
milk
buns
and
cake
for
her
own
consumption
and
for
half
the
allowance
for
one
guest
and
in
this
way
provided
ample
for
everybody
without
anyone
being
asked
to
give
more
than
a
very
small
contribution
of
food
before
the
war
i
should
have
been
horrified
at
the
idea
of
inviting
you
to
come
to
a
party
and
bring
your
own
provisions
said
miss
thompson
in
these
days
of
however
we
have
to
do
many
new
and
strange
things
it
wonderful
what
we
can
get
used
to
when
we
try
the
girls
themselves
thought
it
was
immense
fun
each
to
bring
a
little
basket
to
make
the
feast
it
like
an
american
tea
said
gladys
wilks
i
going
to
make
some
scones
myself
we
got
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
sultanas
hoarded
up
we
been
saving
them
for
some
great
occasion
mother
said
they
do
for
my
birthday
cake
so
i
know
she
let
me
use
them
for
this
instead
i
got
a
topping
recipe
if
they
only
turn
out
as
it
says
guess
they
be
jolly
nice
bags
me
one
if
the
cripples
do
want
them
all
declared
maggie
you
shall
have
a
piece
of
my
instead
look
here
interrupted
gertrude
this
business
is
to
be
all
tea
and
buns
we
got
to
give
these
kiddies
a
real
good
time
suggestions
please
do
all
speak
at
once
we
going
to
sing
to
them
and
the
juniors
are
to
do
a
dance
how
about
some
gym
display
um
tolerable
but
my
idea
is
that
they
wo
want
to
sit
and
watch
us
perform
the
whole
time
there
ought
to
be
something
specially
for
themselves
stop
a
minute
i
a
brain
wave
do
speak
to
me
my
mind
working
the
girls
grinned
expectantly
while
gertrude
stood
with
finger
uplifted
for
silence
got
it
she
proclaimed
at
last
we
have
a
surprise
tree
what
that
well
you
ca
exactly
have
a
christmas
tree
at
this
time
of
year
but
we
rig
up
something
very
like
it
you
know
that
little
near
the
we
decorate
it
with
streamers
of
paper
and
ornaments
and
hang
presents
on
with
coloured
ribbons
there
must
be
one
for
each
crippled
child
or
two
if
possible
every
girl
in
this
school
has
got
to
bring
a
present
once
the
idea
of
providing
suitable
entertainment
for
their
invalid
guests
was
mooted
many
suggestions
were
forthcoming
vivian
roy
who
was
the
lucky
owner
of
a
shetland
pony
and
a
tiny
basket
cart
offered
to
bring
these
to
school
and
take
relays
of
children
for
drives
round
the
garden
sybil
beaumont
undertook
to
lend
a
very
superior
gramophone
the
mother
of
one
of
the
juniors
promised
to
send
oranges
violet
parker
told
her
aunt
the
mayoress
about
the
party
and
that
lady
arranged
to
allow
the
use
of
her
carriage
for
the
afternoon
to
carry
some
of
the
children
from
their
homes
to
the
school
and
back
as
means
of
conveyance
were
a
real
difficulty
several
other
parents
followed
her
example
and
sent
governess
cars
or
hired
cabs
it
was
a
form
of
help
for
which
the
secretary
of
the
poor
brave
things
was
particularly
grateful
you
no
idea
what
trouble
it
is
for
their
friends
to
bring
them
she
explained
unless
they
possess
or
can
borrow
some
kind
of
invalid
carriage
it
an
impossibility
also
many
of
them
ca
spare
the
time
to
do
it
in
the
days
of
petrol
plenty
we
used
to
have
an
annual
outing
for
the
children
and
people
lent
their
cars
but
of
course
that
is
all
stopped
now
on
the
afternoon
in
question
the
numerous
hostesses
were
waiting
about
in
the
garden
long
before
their
visitors
were
due
each
day
girl
had
duly
brought
her
basket
the
contents
of
which
were
to
be
pooled
for
general
consumption
the
gramophone
had
been
placed
on
a
table
outside
and
the
shetland
pony
and
cart
were
in
readiness
near
the
door
i
expect
there
been
a
terrific
amount
of
washing
and
dressing
and
going
on
laughed
annie
i
hope
the
children
will
survive
your
scones
gladys
do
be
insulting
my
scones
are
delicious
i
tasted
them
so
i
know
you
greedy
thing
certainly
not
i
could
bring
them
without
seeing
whether
they
were
fit
to
eat
i
heroically
did
touch
even
a
crumb
of
mine
more
goose
you
do
spar
interrupted
gertrude
here
comes
the
first
contingent
it
was
the
mayoress
carriage
and
it
had
brought
six
guests
such
pathetic
little
people
some
of
them
had
crutches
and
could
manage
to
walk
but
others
had
to
be
wheeled
up
the
drive
in
a
bath
chair
which
was
waiting
on
purpose
a
special
corner
of
the
garden
with
couches
and
cosy
seats
had
been
arranged
for
them
and
each
child
as
it
arrived
was
taken
there
two
special
hostesses
being
told
off
to
look
after
it
for
the
afternoon
and
make
it
happy
avelyn
together
with
laura
found
herself
in
charge
of
a
mite
of
a
girl
who
looked
about
eight
but
declared
she
was
nearly
thirteen
it
the
first
time
i
been
out
for
ten
weeks
miss
she
said
shyly
i
lie
on
my
back
most
days
what
do
you
do
can
you
read
asked
avelyn
yes
when
i
get
any
books
our
district
visitor
lends
me
some
have
you
ever
been
to
school
not
since
i
was
nine
it
was
at
school
i
fell
and
hurt
my
back
been
bad
ever
since
the
little
visitors
were
evidently
prepared
to
enjoy
every
moment
of
their
party
they
were
given
tea
almost
immediately
and
did
full
justice
to
the
various
cakes
and
buns
which
the
girls
had
brought
for
them
they
listened
smiling
while
the
gramophone
blared
forth
selections
and
clapped
their
hands
when
the
juniors
danced
for
their
amusement
those
who
could
bear
the
jolting
went
for
short
drives
in
vivian
pony
carriage
but
most
of
them
were
obliged
to
sit
very
still
one
little
fellow
the
cheeriest
of
all
lay
flat
on
a
rug
with
a
cushion
under
his
head
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
move
all
the
children
from
one
place
to
another
their
special
corner
had
been
arranged
round
the
surprise
tree
the
little
presented
a
very
gay
appearance
for
it
had
been
decorated
with
ornaments
coloured
balls
and
glass
birds
crackers
oranges
and
bags
of
sweets
underneath
were
piled
sixty
parcels
tied
up
with
ribbons
mabel
collinson
one
of
the
juniors
dressed
as
a
fairy
and
attended
by
two
brownies
suddenly
made
her
appearance
among
the
bushes
and
going
up
to
the
tree
began
to
strip
its
branches
and
hand
sweets
and
crackers
and
oranges
to
the
expectant
children
the
parcels
came
next
there
were
two
apiece
for
them
and
so
well
had
the
girls
responded
to
the
appeal
for
presents
that
gasps
of
astonishment
and
delight
followed
the
unwrapping
of
the
packages
oh
and
ah
resounded
on
all
sides
it
too
lovely
miss
beamed
avelyn
little
protégée
hugging
a
in
one
arm
and
a
in
the
other
her
neighbour
was
rejoicing
over
a
and
a
and
the
tiny
girl
on
the
couch
was
kissing
a
doll
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
poor
little
helpless
creatures
happy
for
one
afternoon
pretty
but
so
pathetic
that
the
tears
swam
in
miss
thompson
eyes
the
contrast
between
these
crippled
children
and
her
own
sturdy
girls
seemed
so
acute
please
m
volunteered
one
little
boy
lizzie
over
there
says
she
can
say
a
piece
of
poetry
if
you
like
to
hear
her
by
all
means
we
shall
be
only
too
pleased
returned
miss
thompson
going
across
to
the
small
reciter
and
asking
her
to
begin
lizzie
was
a
diminutive
specimen
of
ten
with
a
crooked
spine
and
big
bright
eyes
there
was
a
large
soul
in
the
little
body
and
it
showed
when
she
began
to
speak
her
piece
was
a
patriotic
one
and
she
said
it
well
the
silverside
girls
who
were
near
enough
to
hear
her
applauded
heartily
and
those
who
were
too
far
off
to
catch
a
word
clapped
too
out
of
sympathy
finding
that
everyone
was
interested
miss
thompson
asked
some
of
the
other
children
to
recite
most
of
them
were
too
bashful
but
one
or
two
consented
and
shyly
murmured
a
few
verses
none
however
had
the
fire
and
spirit
of
lizzie
who
was
quite
the
star
of
the
company
she
departed
beaming
with
pride
at
having
distinguished
herself
and
clasping
a
poetry
book
which
miss
peters
had
hurriedly
fetched
from
her
bedroom
and
presented
to
her
it
was
the
nicest
party
we
ever
had
at
the
school
said
laura
watching
as
the
last
of
the
little
guests
was
lifted
into
a
bath
chair
to
be
wheeled
home
there
was
no
mistake
about
their
enjoying
themselves
at
any
rate
they
had
the
time
of
their
lives
bless
agreed
janet
there
was
much
to
tell
the
lavender
lady
when
friday
came
round
again
lately
she
had
grown
to
be
the
centre
of
all
avelyn
actions
she
was
always
so
ready
to
take
a
sympathetic
interest
in
things
and
daphne
daphne
who
of
yore
was
the
recipient
of
innumerable
confidences
had
somehow
been
growing
she
would
sit
and
stitch
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
while
avelyn
poured
out
school
news
and
her
occasional
comments
showed
that
she
was
not
really
listening
she
getting
so
horribly
complained
her
injured
sister
she
not
the
same
girl
she
used
to
be
i
feel
as
if
she
had
drifted
miles
away
in
the
last
few
months
quite
suddenly
she
seems
ten
years
older
than
david
and
tony
and
me
i
do
like
it
you
must
let
daphne
have
her
innings
said
watson
you
have
your
own
some
day
she
ca
remain
a
child
always
i
think
on
the
whole
she
very
good
to
you
younger
ones
it
only
natural
she
should
begin
to
like
the
society
of
older
people
now
her
life
is
just
opening
out
you
must
expect
her
to
give
up
her
whole
time
to
yourself
and
the
boys
do
be
nice
about
it
ave
be
proud
that
you
got
such
a
pretty
sister
and
glad
for
her
to
enjoy
herself
that
was
certainly
a
different
way
of
looking
at
it
avelyn
felt
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
troubled
to
listen
when
daphne
consulted
her
as
to
whether
a
pink
or
a
mauve
voile
blouse
would
look
best
with
her
new
costume
just
at
the
moment
school
affairs
had
seemed
so
much
more
interesting
than
her
sister
clothes
i
suppose
i
a
selfish
beast
she
said
to
herself
the
next
time
daphne
going
out
to
tea
anywhere
i
sit
in
her
bedroom
while
she
dresses
and
hold
hairpins
for
her
or
anything
else
she
wants
the
worst
of
it
is
though
she
does
always
want
me
just
at
present
i
believe
she
any
time
rather
have
jimmy
jimmy
was
daphne
little
fox
terrier
that
is
to
say
he
was
hers
temporarily
for
he
really
belonged
to
captain
harper
she
had
mentioned
one
day
that
she
would
like
a
small
dog
of
her
very
own
and
the
young
officer
had
looked
thoughtful
the
next
week
he
had
turned
up
accompanied
by
jimmy
i
wish
you
accept
him
he
said
he
my
dog
but
i
ca
keep
him
at
the
camp
i
had
him
boarded
out
in
starbury
since
i
been
stationed
here
and
yesterday
i
went
over
and
fetched
him
i
have
him
as
a
loan
and
take
care
of
him
till
you
want
him
again
agreed
daphne
but
i
wo
take
him
right
away
from
you
it
would
be
fair
yes
it
would
if
i
wanted
to
give
him
he
the
best
little
chap
out
you
find
him
a
kind
of
epitome
of
the
catechism
combined
with
all
the
cardinal
virtues
jimmy
make
your
bow
the
little
fox
terrier
which
sat
up
and
saluted
at
its
master
word
of
command
seemed
a
sharp
and
intelligent
specimen
of
the
canine
race
and
when
it
snuggled
its
nose
in
daphne
hand
it
completely
conquered
her
heart
wo
he
want
to
run
back
to
his
master
she
asked
no
he
has
his
orders
and
understands
perfectly
i
explained
the
situation
to
him
and
you
find
he
wo
attempt
to
leave
you
prepared
to
carry
a
stick
or
an
umbrella
mount
guard
over
coats
bark
at
tramps
worry
rats
or
demolish
burglars
jimmy
subsequent
behaviour
certainly
justified
the
character
captain
harper
had
given
him
having
been
solemnly
made
over
by
his
master
he
seemed
to
realize
his
responsibilities
and
attached
himself
to
daphne
with
all
the
strength
of
his
doggy
nature
his
manners
were
excellent
he
would
lie
curled
up
on
the
rug
at
and
did
not
beg
until
he
had
received
express
permission
only
winking
an
occasional
pathetic
eye
in
the
direction
of
the
table
i
sure
he
understands
every
single
word
i
say
to
him
said
daphne
who
idolized
her
new
possession
i
do
know
how
i
should
get
along
without
him
now
what
will
you
do
if
you
have
to
give
him
back
asked
avelyn
it
has
come
to
giving
him
back
yet
evaded
daphne
but
on
the
very
saturday
after
the
surprise
tree
party
the
question
cropped
up
captain
harper
had
come
over
to
walden
to
fulfil
a
promise
of
making
a
fresh
door
for
one
of
the
chicken
coops
he
had
taken
possession
of
the
carpentry
room
in
the
cottage
and
was
working
away
at
the
joiner
bench
daphne
held
the
wire
steady
and
avelyn
with
a
strong
sense
that
she
was
not
wanted
handed
the
nails
jimmy
lay
at
his
ease
upon
the
shavings
and
yawned
his
attitude
of
complete
comfort
attracted
attention
if
you
really
sent
back
to
starbury
next
month
you
have
to
take
him
with
you
commented
daphne
i
never
take
back
a
present
i
once
given
answered
the
captain
firmly
we
argued
that
out
before
but
for
jimmy
sake
he
loves
you
far
the
best
still
i
only
a
makeshift
i
assure
you
he
does
then
how
can
we
tell
his
preference
let
him
decide
for
himself
you
stand
over
there
and
i
stand
here
and
we
both
call
him
at
once
and
see
which
he
runs
to
poor
jimmy
a
and
agitated
dog
rose
from
his
bed
of
shavings
and
remained
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
whimpering
and
looking
with
indecision
towards
the
master
who
had
brought
him
up
from
puppyhood
and
the
sweet
young
mistress
who
had
won
his
heart
then
he
made
a
rush
towards
the
former
and
seizing
him
by
the
trouser
hauled
him
across
the
room
in
the
direction
of
daphne
jimmy
has
solved
the
matter
said
captain
harper
he
wants
us
both
to
own
him
and
at
that
point
avelyn
felt
that
her
presence
grew
so
very
that
she
murmured
some
excuse
about
finishing
her
lessons
and
made
her
exit
from
the
cottage
leaving
her
sister
and
captain
harper
to
settle
the
disputed
question
of
ownership
in
their
own
fashion
i
suppose
this
is
growing
up
ruminated
avelyn
as
she
crossed
the
yard
and
went
into
the
orchard
daphne
seems
to
enjoy
it
and
give
her
her
innings
by
all
manner
of
means
how
funny
it
would
be
to
have
a
it
come
to
that
some
day
if
i
not
mistaken
no
thanks
i
do
want
to
grow
up
just
yet
myself
perhaps
i
change
my
mind
later
on
but
at
the
present
time
i
ever
so
much
rather
be
a
schoolgirl
chapter
xx
pamela
secret
in
her
with
the
lavender
lady
avelyn
had
truth
to
tell
rather
neglected
pamela
their
friendship
had
always
been
more
or
less
of
a
spasmodic
character
they
often
met
on
the
road
on
monday
mornings
and
travelled
in
the
same
compartment
of
the
train
and
they
would
return
from
harlingden
together
on
friday
afternoons
generally
they
talked
the
ordinary
schoolgirl
chatter
about
silverside
doings
pamela
rarely
mentioned
her
own
concerns
very
occasionally
she
would
make
some
reference
to
past
adventures
in
america
but
about
her
present
home
she
was
extremely
reserved
she
seemed
to
shut
up
and
freeze
at
once
at
the
slightest
allusion
to
moss
cottage
though
she
had
accepted
several
invitations
to
walden
she
had
never
asked
avelyn
to
tea
for
a
return
visit
there
was
an
air
of
mystery
about
her
that
increased
rather
than
diminished
with
their
further
acquaintance
to
avelyn
she
always
seemed
like
a
disinherited
princess
she
was
sure
that
pamela
brooded
over
the
fact
that
the
lyngates
estate
should
have
been
hers
her
uncle
name
was
never
mentioned
between
them
since
the
evening
when
he
had
tried
to
cut
down
the
barrier
over
the
brook
at
walden
the
watsons
had
seen
little
of
hockheimer
he
had
not
again
attempted
to
interfere
with
their
property
he
seemed
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
his
time
in
london
but
made
flying
visits
every
week
to
the
hall
people
in
the
neighbourhood
gave
him
the
cold
shoulder
though
he
was
generous
in
subscribing
to
local
charities
he
was
certainly
not
popular
the
general
feeling
was
one
of
mistrust
nothing
certain
had
ever
been
brought
against
him
but
the
fact
of
his
german
nationality
remained
it
was
whispered
that
but
for
influence
in
high
quarters
he
would
have
been
interned
whether
hockheimer
was
or
was
not
aware
of
the
rumours
that
were
being
circulated
in
his
disfavour
it
was
impossible
to
tell
he
never
came
to
church
seldom
appeared
in
the
village
he
was
more
strict
than
ever
against
trespassing
in
his
woods
though
other
landlords
in
the
district
had
been
lax
in
that
respect
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
the
watsons
disliked
him
so
much
that
they
avoided
him
whenever
possible
if
they
saw
him
walking
along
the
village
street
they
would
dive
down
a
side
lane
or
run
up
into
the
churchyard
they
thoroughly
pitied
pamela
for
being
dependent
upon
him
since
the
memorable
morning
when
she
had
climbed
over
the
palings
into
the
garden
and
had
hidden
inside
the
stable
avelyn
had
never
visited
moss
cottage
she
was
sure
that
she
had
then
almost
surprised
some
secret
pamela
indeed
had
been
on
the
very
verge
of
telling
her
her
friend
confidential
mood
had
passed
however
and
a
wall
of
reserve
had
taken
its
place
one
saturday
avelyn
taking
out
her
home
work
made
the
horrible
discovery
that
she
had
left
her
history
in
her
locker
at
school
to
go
to
miss
thompson
class
with
an
unprepared
lesson
meant
trouble
the
only
way
out
of
the
difficulty
was
to
walk
over
and
borrow
from
pamela
who
though
in
a
lower
form
used
the
same
textbook
for
history
this
time
she
did
not
venture
to
climb
over
the
palings
but
knocked
at
the
door
in
orthodox
fashion
it
was
opened
by
pamela
herself
who
beamed
a
welcome
come
in
i
all
alone
mother
gone
to
the
station
i
was
just
getting
horribly
tired
of
being
by
myself
it
perfectly
lovely
to
see
you
my
history
yes
you
shall
have
it
certainly
i
learnt
my
lesson
but
come
in
and
have
a
chat
i
was
sitting
in
the
garden
shall
we
go
out
there
avelyn
much
preferred
the
garden
to
the
rather
dark
little
the
girls
went
to
a
shady
corner
under
a
tree
where
pamela
had
spread
a
rug
and
cushions
they
settled
themselves
down
leisurely
and
began
to
talk
what
this
you
got
here
asked
avelyn
presently
taking
up
a
prayer
book
that
was
lying
on
the
rug
opened
at
the
last
page
are
you
studying
the
table
of
articles
you
surely
do
have
to
learn
that
in
your
scripture
lesson
we
did
the
of
common
prayer
last
term
but
we
did
take
the
articles
i
not
looking
at
those
said
pamela
i
looking
at
the
table
of
kindred
and
affinity
i
want
to
find
out
whom
a
man
may
marry
and
whom
he
may
he
must
marry
his
wife
daughter
daughter
or
his
brother
son
wife
or
his
mother
brother
wife
but
may
he
marry
his
deceased
wife
deceased
brother
wife
goodness
child
i
sure
i
do
know
why
do
you
ask
pamela
shut
the
prayer
book
with
a
bang
it
uncle
she
said
vehemently
he
behaving
in
such
an
extraordinary
way
oh
ave
do
you
know
i
believe
he
trying
to
make
up
to
mother
do
look
so
incredulous
i
mean
it
i
must
tell
somebody
or
i
shall
burst
i
kept
it
all
in
long
enough
too
long
ave
did
the
boys
ever
tell
you
about
that
letter
they
found
inside
the
latin
dictionary
i
can
see
by
your
face
that
they
did
well
i
brought
it
home
and
laid
it
on
the
table
and
before
mother
had
time
to
look
at
it
it
disappeared
uncle
had
been
here
and
i
he
took
it
he
must
certainly
have
done
so
he
did
i
can
tell
you
that
returned
avelyn
and
she
confided
to
her
friend
what
her
brothers
had
witnessed
in
the
wood
how
hockheimer
had
been
on
the
point
of
burning
the
paper
when
jack
had
appeared
and
run
away
with
it
pamela
listened
with
intense
eagerness
that
explains
so
much
she
gasped
i
do
know
what
was
in
the
letter
but
i
imagine
it
may
have
been
my
grandfather
will
if
it
was
and
he
left
the
estate
to
daddy
no
wonder
uncle
fritz
tried
to
burn
it
he
did
quite
succeed
and
this
or
whatever
he
is
has
scooted
off
with
it
uncle
knows
it
still
in
existence
and
that
any
day
it
might
be
produced
and
he
might
be
turned
out
of
the
hall
he
trying
to
guard
against
that
and
he
playing
a
very
deep
game
he
thinks
that
if
he
were
to
marry
mother
as
he
married
poor
aunt
dora
he
secure
the
estate
to
himself
a
second
time
does
your
mother
like
him
not
really
i
believe
she
frightened
of
him
he
makes
her
do
anything
he
tells
her
you
do
know
how
dreadfully
worried
i
am
about
it
if
i
had
him
for
a
stepfather
i
should
run
away
i
rather
join
the
gipsies
than
live
with
him
oh
if
we
could
only
get
on
the
track
of
that
paper
has
nothing
more
been
heard
of
jack
nothing
at
all
since
the
autumn
he
appeared
just
for
a
short
time
and
then
vanished
again
and
no
one
ever
knew
who
he
was
not
a
soul
pamela
gave
a
long
sigh
he
has
the
secret
whatever
it
is
who
knows
whether
i
ever
find
it
ave
here
pamela
lowered
her
voice
i
got
a
secret
too
i
been
longing
and
yearning
to
tell
it
to
you
a
dozen
times
i
had
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
then
i
felt
afraid
and
stopped
i
kept
waiting
hoping
to
find
out
more
but
i
ca
find
out
by
myself
i
want
help
what
do
you
mean
come
and
i
show
you
we
have
the
place
to
ourselves
uncle
is
in
town
i
saw
him
going
to
the
station
this
morning
so
he
not
likely
to
burst
in
and
interrupt
us
pamela
rose
and
led
the
way
down
the
garden
to
the
stable
where
avelyn
had
surprised
her
before
it
was
locked
but
she
took
a
key
from
a
under
a
stone
and
undid
the
padlock
she
motioned
her
friend
to
go
up
the
ladder
and
followed
her
the
room
above
was
a
bare
loft
it
was
not
quite
empty
however
for
in
the
corner
stood
a
small
table
with
an
object
on
it
that
looked
like
the
receiver
of
a
telephone
come
here
said
pamela
she
took
up
the
instrument
and
placed
it
on
her
friend
head
it
had
a
band
which
fitted
across
the
forehead
and
a
receiver
for
each
ear
a
cord
connected
it
with
the
wall
do
you
hear
anything
asked
pamela
yes
a
sort
of
humming
pamela
smiled
significantly
and
put
back
the
instrument
on
the
table
what
is
it
breathed
avelyn
rather
awed
wireless
messages
uncle
spends
hours
here
do
you
mean
to
say
this
is
a
wireless
station
pamela
nodded
but
they
not
allowed
i
know
that
perfectly
well
if
it
were
found
out
he
could
be
arrested
he
deserves
to
be
sometimes
i
wish
he
were
does
your
mother
know
no
i
sure
she
does
she
never
comes
to
the
stable
and
if
she
did
she
would
climb
the
ladder
sometimes
uncle
is
very
keen
about
the
messages
he
makes
me
stay
here
with
the
receiver
on
my
head
listening
for
them
while
he
sits
in
the
cottage
talking
to
mother
and
drinking
brandy
which
he
brings
in
a
flask
when
i
hear
that
humming
noise
i
have
to
go
and
tell
him
and
he
flies
down
to
the
stable
can
you
understand
the
messages
no
it
something
like
ordinary
telegraphy
i
suppose
and
i
know
the
code
i
wish
i
did
i
ca
imagine
how
this
wireless
apparatus
has
been
discovered
it
so
well
hidden
the
poles
go
right
up
among
the
boughs
of
the
tree
i
do
think
you
ought
to
keep
this
secret
any
longer
pam
no
more
do
i
but
i
never
dared
to
tell
it
to
a
soul
before
uncle
would
kill
me
if
he
knew
i
brought
you
in
here
what
must
i
do
avelyn
hesitated
i
like
to
ask
somebody
could
you
come
home
with
me
this
afternoon
can
you
leave
the
house
i
lock
the
door
and
put
the
key
under
a
stone
where
mother
would
find
it
if
she
gets
back
first
ave
i
just
about
desperate
i
do
anything
to
end
the
life
i
living
now
there
treachery
of
some
sort
going
on
i
believe
and
i
being
wound
up
in
it
without
my
knowledge
and
against
my
will
my
father
gave
his
life
for
his
country
is
his
daughter
to
help
to
betray
it
never
never
in
this
world
i
suffer
torture
first
oh
i
wish
i
were
braver
sometimes
i
a
terrible
coward
and
i
feel
so
horribly
afraid
of
uncle
fritz
you
do
know
how
he
frightens
me
my
nerves
are
all
on
edge
come
home
with
me
dear
said
avelyn
soothingly
if
you
let
me
ask
mother
i
believe
she
know
what
we
ought
to
do
pamela
was
very
much
upset
and
seemed
almost
hysterical
her
hands
trembled
and
she
wiped
drops
from
her
eyes
she
climbed
down
the
ladder
padlocked
the
stable
door
again
went
into
the
house
for
her
hat
and
the
history
book
locked
the
front
door
hid
the
key
in
the
rockery
and
pronounced
herself
ready
to
start
avelyn
was
glad
to
have
persuaded
her
so
easily
her
own
mind
was
in
a
whirl
to
have
found
a
wireless
telegraphy
installation
in
the
old
stable
was
indeed
a
discovery
which
would
very
seriously
implicate
hockheimer
the
responsibility
of
the
knowledge
was
too
great
to
be
borne
only
by
two
schoolgirls
it
must
be
shared
by
some
older
and
wiser
person
the
friends
walked
silently
along
the
road
at
the
corner
by
the
oak
wood
they
met
david
and
anthony
at
sight
of
them
the
boys
came
running
forward
in
much
excitement
we
just
seen
jack
again
they
cried
this
was
indeed
a
piece
of
news
jack
who
had
vanished
from
the
neighbourhood
since
the
autumn
for
the
moment
it
even
threw
wireless
telegraphy
into
the
shade
where
when
exclaimed
the
girls
eagerly
just
a
minute
ago
we
were
up
the
bank
there
after
a
butterfly
and
he
came
bounding
past
and
jumped
into
the
wood
which
way
did
he
go
anthony
pointed
a
stumpy
finger
to
indicate
the
direction
pamela
set
her
teeth
i
going
after
him
she
announced
the
watsons
stared
at
her
amazed
jack
had
been
the
terror
of
the
village
and
pamela
was
not
altogether
conspicuous
for
courage
i
must
find
him
i
must
she
continued
it
the
only
chance
of
getting
that
lost
paper
and
climbing
over
the
palings
she
scrambled
into
the
wood
among
the
bracken
the
watsons
were
not
a
family
to
desert
a
chum
david
and
anthony
were
after
her
in
half
a
second
and
avelyn
followed
as
quickly
as
her
feminine
skirts
allowed
her
heart
was
beating
violently
whether
the
object
of
their
search
was
human
or
spectral
he
was
equally
a
cause
for
alarm
they
could
hear
sounds
higher
up
the
wood
pamela
was
running
fast
and
so
were
the
boys
there
was
a
sudden
unearthly
yell
and
a
dark
masked
figure
came
bounding
towards
them
in
a
series
of
wild
leaps
man
monkey
or
bogy
it
jumped
with
incredible
speed
the
boys
set
up
a
shout
and
dashed
towards
it
but
it
gave
an
enormous
leap
and
sprang
past
them
it
would
have
got
clean
away
but
for
a
tangled
bramble
bush
that
broke
its
course
the
next
moment
it
was
sprawling
among
the
bracken
the
boys
rushed
upon
it
and
while
david
pinned
it
down
anthony
tore
off
the
black
mask
to
their
utter
amazement
it
revealed
the
features
of
their
friend
captain
harper
at
the
sight
of
their
blank
faces
he
burst
out
laughing
the
game
up
at
last
he
hinnied
i
saw
it
was
you
kids
and
i
could
resist
giving
you
a
scare
i
do
know
that
i
meant
to
let
you
find
me
out
though
if
i
had
tumbled
i
have
got
off
what
have
i
been
masquerading
like
this
for
he
suddenly
looked
grave
that
a
little
business
of
my
own
i
wanted
to
find
out
something
and
i
thought
i
raise
a
rumour
that
might
keep
the
woods
clear
of
ordinary
trespassers
how
did
i
do
it
easy
enough
some
theatrical
togs
i
had
by
me
and
springs
on
my
heels
we
seen
you
before
in
this
volunteered
anthony
when
when
you
pounced
on
hockheimer
and
stopped
him
burning
a
letter
we
were
there
watching
echoed
david
oh
have
you
got
the
paper
still
it
was
mine
cried
pamela
breathlessly
it
was
captain
harper
turn
to
be
astonished
yours
what
had
it
to
do
with
you
he
asked
sharply
pamela
and
avelyn
explained
between
them
he
took
a
cigarette
from
his
pocket
and
lighted
it
as
he
listened
this
is
quite
another
development
he
commented
part
of
the
paper
was
burnt
i
could
understand
the
drift
of
it
have
you
got
it
still
besought
pamela
no
i
gave
it
to
my
superior
officer
but
if
it
is
of
such
importance
as
you
say
i
could
get
it
examined
on
your
behalf
i
speak
to
my
colonel
about
it
it
worth
investigating
pam
said
avelyn
impulsively
bending
her
head
and
whispering
in
her
friend
ear
do
you
know
i
believe
it
would
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
to
tell
captain
harper
what
you
told
me
this
afternoon
know
better
even
than
mother
what
you
ought
to
do
you
tell
him
i
dare
faltered
pamela
if
captain
harper
had
been
astonished
before
he
was
doubly
amazed
now
great
scott
it
the
very
thing
i
been
on
the
scent
of
for
this
six
months
he
ejaculated
we
guessed
there
was
a
wireless
somewhere
over
here
but
never
could
locate
it
and
to
think
i
owe
it
to
you
kids
pamela
you
a
true
loyal
little
englishwoman
i
think
you
find
you
pretty
soon
be
rid
of
that
precious
uncle
of
yours
what
must
i
do
about
it
asked
pamela
who
was
half
crying
captain
harper
did
not
at
once
reply
he
seemed
cogitating
then
his
face
cleared
nothing
at
present
he
replied
i
pledge
you
all
on
your
word
of
honour
to
mention
this
business
to
nobody
we
leave
the
wireless
where
it
is
and
get
the
messages
if
possible
that
our
game
pamela
could
you
manage
to
learn
the
morse
code
if
i
taught
you
i
try
i
undertake
you
soon
learn
it
then
what
you
got
to
do
is
to
listen
at
the
receiver
and
report
to
us
i
can
tell
you
you
may
be
working
an
uncommonly
important
little
bit
of
business
do
cry
child
the
fellow
is
only
your
uncle
by
marriage
he
no
blood
relation
of
yours
think

night
walk
pamela
went
back
to
moss
cottage
with
new
courage
the
secret
which
had
almost
overwhelmed
her
when
she
had
tried
to
bear
it
alone
assumed
a
different
aspect
now
she
shared
it
with
her
friends
captain
harper
had
taken
the
full
responsibility
of
the
affair
and
as
one
of
his
officers
she
knew
he
could
be
trusted
she
placed
herself
entirely
in
his
hands
and
followed
his
directions
implicitly
to
keep
watch
without
arousing
her
uncle
suspicions
was
to
be
her
present
rôle
under
cover
of
going
to
tea
with
the
watsons
she
met
captain
harper
at
walden
and
learnt
from
him
the
morse
code
once
she
had
mastered
that
she
was
able
to
write
down
some
of
the
wireless
messages
to
her
they
were
absolutely
unintelligible
for
they
were
in
cipher
but
she
made
a
faithful
record
of
what
she
heard
through
the
receiver
and
sent
it
by
david
or
anthony
to
the
young
officer
for
the
moment
captain
harper
acknowledged
himself
baffled
we
have
the
keys
to
a
number
of
ciphers
but
there
one
here
we
understand
it
solely
for
this
reason
we
allowing
this
wireless
apparatus
at
moss
cottage
to
remain
where
it
is
pamela
must
use
all
her
ingenuity
to
discover
the
key
to
the
cipher
she
the
only
person
who
has
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
if
we
were
to
arrest
hockheimer
at
once
we
might
or
might
not
find
treasonable
papers
upon
him
it
is
doubtful
if
we
should
learn
his
secret
to
david
and
anthony
the
affair
was
of
the
supremest
interest
they
envied
pamela
her
unique
chance
of
serving
her
country
they
were
glad
enough
to
be
employed
as
carriers
and
would
take
the
notes
from
her
when
they
met
her
in
the
morning
and
according
to
arrangement
convey
them
to
captain
harper
sometimes
they
took
them
direct
to
the
camp
after
they
returned
from
school
and
sometimes
they
handed
them
to
an
orderly
who
would
be
strolling
about
near
the
station
as
for
pamela
she
lived
from
day
to
day
in
a
ferment
of
expectation
waiting
and
watching
for
her
opportunity
and
one
evening
she
found
it
hockheimer
had
come
as
was
his
custom
to
moss
cottage
and
had
set
his
niece
to
listen
for
messages
while
he
took
his
ease
in
the
house
for
an
hour
or
more
pamela
had
sat
with
the
receiver
to
her
ears
but
had
heard
nothing
at
last
came
the
familiar
humming
she
jotted
down
the
letters
put
the
paper
safely
in
her
pocket
and
ran
up
the
garden
to
warn
her
uncle
that
night
he
had
been
drinking
more
heavily
than
usual
he
lurched
in
his
walk
as
he
approached
the
stable
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
climbed
the
ladder
pamela
followed
him
nervously
his
hands
shook
as
he
fitted
on
the
receiver
but
he
nevertheless
took
down
the
message
then
he
paused
and
seemed
to
be
calculating
something
out
on
the
paper
she
crept
a
little
nearer
he
was
too
muddled
to
realize
her
approach
she
peeped
over
his
shoulder
unnoticed
in
his
condition
he
was
working
out
the
cipher
and
writing
it
down
she
copied
it
word
by
word
it
was

head
pamela
backed
away
cautiously
towards
the
ladder
just
as
she
reached
it
her
uncle
turned
round
and
called
to
her
give
me
a
hand
pam
do
feel
very
well
he
stammered
thickly
got
to
go
out
too
must
go
home
and
get
the
car
little
store
of
petrol
they
do
know
about
and
i
sha
tell
them
either
he
hinnied
at
his
own
joke
give
me
your
hand
he
leaned
heavily
on
his
niece
and
she
helped
him
down
the
ladder
she
watched
him
as
he
stumbled
along
the
narrow
path
in
the
darkness
he
called
to
her
but
she
did
not
follow
him
to
the
cottage
instead
she
went
to
the
palings
and
scrambled
over
into
the
high
road
she
surmised
that
she
had
surprised
a
most
important
secret
one
which
she
felt
must
be
communicated
at
once
to
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
captain
harper
should
know
of
this
by
warning
him
in
time
she
might
prevent
some
great
disaster
she
must
get
to
the
camp
as
quickly
as
possible
it
was
late
long
past
eleven
hockheimer
had
had
no
compunction
in
keeping
his
niece
out
of
bed
to
mind
his
business
and
the
night
was
moonless
pamela
shuddered
as
she
thought
of
the
long
lonely
walk
before
her
could
she
find
the
camp
in
the
dark
a
sudden
inspiration
struck
her
she
would
hurry
to
the
watsons
instead
and
ask
one
of
the
boys
to
go
on
a
bicycle
she
ran
almost
all
the
way
along
the
familiar
road
to
walden
she
found
the
house
shut
up
and
the
family
gone
to
bed
but
she
made
a
with
the
knocker
that
soon
roused
them
what
is
it
cried
david
out
of
the
window
it
i
pamela
i
brought
news
she
gasped
the
watsons
were
downstairs
directly
they
listened
breathlessly
to
the
story
she
had
to
tell
david
and
anthony
hurried
to
the
outhouse
for
their
bicycles
and
set
off
at
once
for
the
camp
to
find
captain
harper
who
could
say
how
much
might
depend
on
their
speed
pamela
watched
them
go
with
a
feeling
of
intense
relief
her
part
of
the
business
was
finished
she
had
now
set
the
machinery
in
motion
that
would
accomplish
the
rest
the
reaction
after
the
intense
strain
was
so
great
that
she
burst
into
tears
i
must
go
home
she
sobbed
mother
will
think
i
am
lost
daphne
and
i
will
go
with
you
i
ca
let
you
walk
back
alone
at
this
time
of
night
said
watson
kindly
if
you
take
my
advice
dear
you
tell
your
mother
everything
now
she
ought
to
know
pamela
friends
escorted
her
to
the
door
of
moss
cottage
and
left
her
there
what
explanation
she
gave
to
her
mother
they
never
knew
they
feared
there
was
great
unpleasantness
in
store
for
the
reynolds
for
hockheimer
was
sure
to
be
arrested
and
the
fact
that
it
must
be
through
his
niece
instrumentality
only
seemed
to
make
matters
worse
david
and
anthony
returned
with
the
news
that
they
had
roused
captain
harper
at
the
camp
and
that
after
reading
the
message
he
had
ridden
off
immediately
upon
his
motor
bicycle
they
went
to
bed
wondering
what
would
be
happening
while
they
slept
the
boys
looked
out
for
pamela
next
morning
on
the
road
to
the
station
but
she
was
not
there
the
train
for
once
went
without
her
they
spent
an
agitated
day
at
school
and
hurried
back
from
netherton
that
afternoon
at
topmost
speed
they
found
captain
harper
in
the
garden
at
walden
he
looked
very
grave
do
you
know
what
that
message
was
you
brought
me
he
asked
translated
into
english
it
meant
in
channel
show
light
on
berry
head
i
hear
a
certain
important
vessel
had
an
extremely
narrow
escape
last
night
the
wireless
apparatus
at
moss
cottage
has
been
taken
down
already
the
police
went
up
there
this
morning
and
mr
hockheimer
captain
harper
knocked
the
end
off
his
cigarette
before
he
answered
hockheimer
has
gone
to
settle
his
great
account
he
and
his
car
were
found
in
the
river
at
chadwick
this
morning
the
road
turns
at
a
very
sharp
angle
there
on
to
the
bridge
and
it
is
thought
that
in
the
darkness
he
missed
his
way
and
went
over
the
bank
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
he
was
going
to
give
signals
to
the
enemy
we
had
long
suspected
him
as
a
spy
and
part
of
my
business
down
here
had
been
to
watch
him
in
the
circumstances
this
has
been
the
most
merciful
thing
that
could
have
happened
for
the
sake
of
the
reynolds
we
are
hushing
the
matter
up
there
is
no
need
for
it
to
be
bruited
about
the
neighbourhood
your
family
are
the
only
people
who
have
any
knowledge
of
the
affair
i
can
trust
you
to
keep
it
from
going
further
on
our
honour
the
boys
assured
him
the
sad
fatality
at
chadwick
bridge
made
a
sensation
in
the
local
newspapers
an
inquest
was
held
on
hockheimer
and
a
verdict
of
death
from
misadventure
returned
though
many
people
in
the
neighbourhood
may
have
had
their
suspicions
as
to
the
nature
of
his
errand
on
that
dark
night
no
evidence
of
an
incriminating
nature
was
brought
before
the
coroner
he
was
buried
at
lyngates
in
the
family
vault
where
his
wife
had
been
carried
two
years
before
he
had
left
no
will
and
the
question
of
who
was
to
inherit
the
lyngates
property
might
be
a
matter
for
chancery
to
settle
by
the
advice
of
the
old
solicitor
who
had
managed
the
estate
for
many
years
reynolds
and
pamela
took
temporary
possession
of
the
hall
until
a
claim
could
be
set
up
on
their
behalf
at
the
time
of
squire
reynolds
death
it
had
been
the
current
gossip
of
the
village
that
some
later
will
than
the
one
proved
must
be
in
existence
if
such
a
will
had
been
made
however
it
had
never
been
found
the
only
possible
clue
seemed
to
be
the
letter
that
david
and
anthony
had
found
inside
the
latin
dictionary
which
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
hockheimer
and
had
been
so
strangely
rescued
from
destruction
by
captain
harper
when
masquerading
as
jack
the
latter
reported
that
at
the
time
he
had
examined
the
sheet
anticipating
that
it
might
contain
treasonable
correspondence
but
had
been
unable
to
make
sense
of
it
in
accordance
with
instructions
he
had
handed
it
over
to
his
colonel
and
he
supposed
it
would
now
be
filed
in
the
secret
service
department
red
tape
might
prevent
repossession
of
the
original
but
he
was
using
his
influence
to
obtain
a
copy
after
considerable
delay
a
reply
came
from
the
war
office
to
the
effect
that
the
paper
in
question
appeared
to
have
been
partially
burnt
but
that
the
remaining
fragment
ran
as
follows
bitter
thoughts
against
you
but
love
for
your
country
has
are
and
i
am
ready
to
acknowledge
your
to
see
them
should
they
ever
come
to
gones
shall
be
bygones
now
i
am
in
your
favour
and
shall
put
it
is
sure
to
be
found
both
die
they
will
be
provided
illustration
who
could
say
how
much
might
depend
on
their
speed
i
afraid
it
no
use
in
a
court
of
law
pamela
said
captain
harper
as
he
showed
her
the
copy
of
the
paper
it
the
merest
scrap
by
imagining
the
missing
words
we
might
make
it
into
something
like
this
but
imagination
wo
give
it
legal
value
here
what
i
fancy
it
may
have
been
i
own
i
held
hard
and
bitter
thoughts
against
you
but
now
i
feel
that
your
love
for
your
country
has
shown
me
what
you
are
and
i
am
ready
to
acknowledge
your
wife
and
child
and
to
see
them
should
they
ever
come
to
england
by
gones
shall
be
bygones
now
i
am
making
a
new
will
in
your
favour
and
shall
put
it
in
a
place
where
it
is
sure
to
be
found
so
that
should
we
both
die
they
will
be
provided
for
if
this
surmise
is
correct
continued
captain
harper
and
there
really
was
a
new
will
it
may
possibly
be
hidden
somewhere
at
the
hall
we
searched
everywhere
said
pamela
sadly
two
lawyer
clerks
have
been
here
and
gone
through
every
morsel
of
paper
in
the
house
and
turned
out
every
drawer
and
cupboard
i
think
myself
that
perhaps
uncle
fritz
may
have
found
it
and
destroyed
it
mother
and
i
spend
all
our
spare
time
looking
but
we
never
have
any
luck
i
do
think
lucky
people
we
seem
just
to
have
misfortune
after
misfortune
it
has
always
been
like
this
all
our
lives
cheer
up
it
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
comforted
captain
harper
i
advise
you
to
show
this
paper
to
your
solicitor
though
afraid
it
nothing
to
go
by
pamela
affairs
did
indeed
seem
to
have
reached
a
crisis
her
fortunes
were
much
discussed
in
the
neighbourhood
and
general
opinion
decided
that
she
would
have
difficulty
in
establishing
legally
her
right
to
what
undoubtedly
ought
to
be
hers
several
naturalized
german
relations
of
hockheimer
had
put
in
for
the
estate
there
was
likely
to
be
a
long
and
expensive
lawsuit
before
the
case
was
settled
then
one
day
a
wonderful
thing
occurred
an
utterly
unexpected
and
marvellous
thing
but
one
that
thank
god
has
happened
in
other
families
since
the
war
began
the
postwoman
who
delivered
the
letter
did
not
know
that
it
differed
from
other
letters
she
popped
it
through
the
slit
in
the
front
door
and
rang
the
bell
as
usual
and
went
on
her
way
all
unsuspecting
what
news
she
had
left
behind
her
yet
when
reynolds
saw
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
she
gave
a
little
sharp
cry
and
fainted
away
pamela
did
not
go
to
school
that
day
nor
the
next
she
wrote
to
avelyn
to
explain
her
absence
the
latter
read
the
letter
twice
before
her
amazed
brain
could
really
grasp
its
contents
my
dear
ave
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
our
good
luck
daddy
is
alive
he
was
killed
at
mons
after
all
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
never
reported
he
was
kept
most
fearfully
strictly
in
a
fortress
and
allowed
no
news
of
the
outside
world
he
and
a
companion
spent
eighteen
months
making
a
tunnel
out
of
their
cell
and
after
simply
thrilling
adventures
they
escaped
and
swam
a
river
and
got
into
swiss
territory
he
coming
home
and
mother
and
i
are
going
up
to
london
to
meet
him
we
almost
off
our
heads
will
you
please
tell
miss
thompson
this
is
why
i
not
at
school
we
start
for
town
morning
much
love
from
pam
it
was
indeed
a
most
happy
ending
to
all
the
troubles
of
poor
reynolds
and
pamela
by
the
will
which
had
already
been
proved
captain
reynolds
inherited
his
father
estate
which
had
only
passed
to
the
daughter
dora
in
default
of
a
male
heir
he
was
soon
able
to
settle
up
the
legal
side
of
the
matter
and
to
obtain
formal
possession
of
the
whole
property
i
made
my
own
will
now
and
left
everything
safely
tied
up
for
you
and
your
mother
before
i
go
out
to
the
front
again
he
told
his
daughter
oh
daddy
must
you
leave
us
and
go
back
to
france
wailed
pamela
every
hour
i
spent
in
that
fortress
pam
made
me
all
the
more
resolved
to
help
to
fight
this
war
to
the
finish
would
you
want
me
to
shirk
and
fail
my
country
i
know
you
better
than
that
tell
me
again
what
you
told
me
in
and
pamela
stood
up
straight
and
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
repeated
though
it
tear
and
break
my
heart
i
let
you
go
when
the
motherland
is
calling
be
it
so
let
my
own
poor
need
and
grief
be
set
aside
that
justice
and
the
right
may
now
abide
god
put
courage
and
true
might
in
your
arm
may
his
mercy
keep
your
life
safe
from
harm
every
hour
my
earnest
prayer
shall
be
this
may
we
meet
and
greet
again
with
a
kiss
chapter
xxii
the
lecture
hall
is
dedicated
ever
since
the
laying
of
the
foundation
stone
in
january
the
new
lecture
hall
had
been
in
process
of
construction
owing
to
the
war
and
the
scarcity
of
labour
it
made
slow
progress
sometimes
the
building
went
on
with
a
spurt
and
sometimes
for
weeks
nothing
at
all
was
done
those
optimists
who
had
prophesied
that
it
would
be
in
readiness
after
the
easter
holidays
found
themselves
much
mistaken
after
innumerable
delays
and
disappointments
however
the
place
was
finished

the
end

decided
to
combine
its
opening
with
the
annual
the
double
function
marked
a
great
occasion
in
the
annals
of
the
school
the
increased
accommodation
would
allow
a
large
gathering
and
many
invitations
were
sent
forth
it
was
even
whispered
that
the
chair
was
to
be
taken
by
the
local
member
of
parliament
silverside
coming
on
no
end
said
consie
arkwright
we
never
used
to
have
such
grandees
down
miss
thompson
used
to
be
content
with
some
ordinary
clergyman
or
elderly
professor
to
give
the
prizes
and
now
she
wo
look
at
anybody
below
a
bishop
or
a
mayor
or
an
she
loves
these
functions
chuckled
joyce
she
perfectly
happy
when
she
has
on
her
best
dress
and
her
company
smile
and
is
showing
off
the
school
to
an
admiring
crowd
of
visitors
i
wo
say
that
i
do
rather
enjoy
it
myself
it
makes
one
feel
in
the
world
somehow
it
jolly
nice
to
think
that
silverside
is
of
so
much
importance
in
the
town
bet
we
make
a
good
on
dedication
day
commented
laura
who
had
drifted
into
the
conversation
hopscotch
was
saying
something
about
the
whole
school
in
white
dresses
and
our
badges
by
the
by
miss
thompson
got
a
little
surprise
for
us
she
been
having
some
beautiful
ribbon
in
the
school
colours
specially
woven
for
silverside
she
showed
it
to
adah
and
me
this
morning
in
the
study
and
i
can
tell
you
it
topping
we
each
to
have
a
piece
of
it
for
our
hair
and
wear
it
on
the
great
day
so
that
we
all
look
alike
she
having
new
hat
bands
woven
too
for
next
term
i
think
they
be
rather
smart
i
begin
to
wish
i
was
leaving
said
isobel
almost
mournfully
really
silverside
has
been
much
jollier
lately
than
it
used
to
be
it
would
have
been
ripping
fun
to
stop
another
year
and
work
up
the
hockey
as
we
done
the
cricket
and
tennis
there
be
something
to
read
out
in
the
games
report
this
time
purred
joyce
it
be
precious
agreed
consie
the
principal
was
naturally
anxious
that
her
pupils
should
make
a
good
display
on
so
important
an
occasion
she
arranged
a
very
programme
of
the
ceremony
there
were
to
be
speeches
by
local
magnates
the
school
report
must
be
read
the
hall
dedicated
and
the
prizes
distributed
she
decided
that
her
pupils
ought
to
sing
one
or
two
suitable
songs
and
she
came
in
to
the
singing
class
one
morning
to
discuss
the
matter
with
miss
webster
and
hear
the
girls
run
through
a
few
glees
she
found
it
difficult
to
make
a
choice
they
nice
in
their
way
but
not
altogether
what
is
needed
i
should
have
liked
something
really
appropriate
to
a
dedication
in
fact
afraid
i
want
what
i
am
not
at
all
likely
to
get
a
special
song
composed
for
silverside
could
we
adapt
anything
suggested
miss
webster
rapidly
turning
over
a
pile
of
music
while
the
class
deeply
interested
sat
listening
to
the
discussion
not
much
use
without
new
words
pity
we
have
no
poet
in
the
school
if
there
had
been
time
i
have
written
to
a
music
publisher
and
asked
if
it
would
be
possible
to
have
a
song
composed
for
us
it
too
late
now
i
wish
i
thought
of
it
sooner
oh
miss
thompson
said
avelyn
suddenly
springing
to
her
feet
and
blushing
hotly
at
her
own
temerity
i
know
a
lady
who
writes
songs
she
very
much
interested
in
silverside
i
told
her
so
much
about
it
i
really
believe
if
i
asked
her
she
make
up
just
what
you
want
she
quite
clever
enough
to
do
it
miss
thompson
convex
glasses
were
focused
on
avelyn
in
a
stare
of
astonished
gratification
she
literally
jumped
at
the
idea
if
you
think
your
friend
would
really
be
so
kind
she
assented
we
should
be
most
grateful
to
her
where
does
she
live
at
lyngates
then
write
to
her
this
afternoon
and
see
if
you
can
persuade
her
to
take
pity
on
us
i
suppose
she
would
know
the
sort
of
thing
we
want
i
explain
exactly
promised
avelyn
sitting
down
conscious
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
class
she
had
covered
herself
with
glory
she
was
excused
english
language
that
afternoon
for
the
purpose
of
writing
her
letter
to
miss
carrington
and
sat
with
her
blotter
an
object
of
much
envy
while
the
remainder
of
the
form
wrestled
with
derivations
i
do
think
my
lavender
lady
will
fail
me
she
murmured
as
she
stamped
her
envelope
i
believe
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
she
like
doing
avelyn
trust
in
her
friend
was
amply
justified
she
received
by
return
of
post
a
card
bearing
the
words
highly
honoured
will
do
my
best
i
knew
she
would
the
dear
clever
darling
rejoiced
avelyn
waving
her
post
card
in
triumph
as
she
ran
down
to
the
study
to
communicate
the
good
news
to
miss
thompson
on
friday
evening
when
avelyn
called
at
the
bungalow
the
lavender
lady
had
a
neat
music
manuscript
ready
for
her
i
hope
it
will
do
she
said
it
as
far
as
possible
what
you
asked
me
for
i
tried
to
express
a
spirit
of
school
patriotism
and
union
in
the
words
which
seems
to
be
the
principal
thing
to
aim
at
just
now
and
i
arranged
the
music
for
three
voices
you
have
to
make
copies
of
it
at
school
miss
peters
will
do
that
with
the
duplicator
beamed
avelyn
i
do
think
you
just
the
most
absolutely
lovely
and
clever
and
delicious
person
that
i
ever
met
or
ever
shall
meet
in
all
this
wide
world
how
do
you
manage
to
think
of
things
i
could
compose
a
song
to
save
my
life
why
i
really
do
know
the
ideas
just
float
into
my
head
somehow
laughed
the
lavender
lady
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
tune
came
to
me
in
bed
at
about
two
in
the
morning
and
i
was
obliged
to
get
up
and
go
downstairs
to
the
piano
to
try
it
over
and
jot
it
down
on
paper
before
i
forgot
it
i
knew
that
if
i
went
to
sleep
again
it
would
escape
me
there
nothing
so
elusive
as
music
yes
i
try
it
over
for
you
if
you
like
it
sound
much
better
though
in
three
parts
i
hope
your
first
sopranos
can
reach
a
sharp
if
not
i
must
set
it
in
a
lower
key
but
i
like
it
best
in
this
they
got
to
get
a
sharp
if
they
crack
their
voices
decided
avelyn
firmly
the
dedication
and
prize
giving
were
to
be
held
on
the
last
afternoon
of
the
term
and
guests
were
invited
for
prompt
the
girls
resplendent
in
white
dresses
and
the
new
hair
ribbons
made
a
brave
show
and
all
were
sitting
discreetly
in
their
places
when
the
distinguished
visitors
were
ushered
on
to
the
platform
during
the
last
six
months
a
better
tone
and
discipline
had
pervaded
the
school
and
there
had
been
no
repetition
of
the
disorderly
scene
that
had
preceded
the
laying
of
the
foundation
stone
every
pupil
of
silverside
now
prided
herself
upon
her
manners
it
had
become
a
matter
of
robson
the
member
of
parliament
for
harlingden
was
a
short
stout
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
big
moustache
and
some
gift
of
oratory
he
fulfilled
with
dignity
his
duties
as
chairman
and
made
a
capital
speech
bringing
in
his
views
about
education
and
wishing
silverside
every
success
a
hundred
and
ten
youthful
pairs
of
hands
clapped
obediently
though
some
of
the
most
junior
heads
had
not
altogether
grasped
the
drift
of
the
remarks
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
school
report
miss
thompson
typed
papers
in
hand
was
standing
up
and
clearing
her
throat
preparatory
to
reading
it
aloud
avelyn
in
the
fifth
row
from
the
front
turned
her
head
and
took
a
comprehensive
glance
round
the
room
it
was
certainly
a
hall
to
be
proud
of
looking
both
stately
and
festive
with
its
decorations
of
flowers
and
flags
and
its
large
palms
upon
the
platform
she
was
glad
that
the
lavender
lady
should
see
it
miss
carrington
had
come
to
the
gathering
with
watson
and
daphne
captain
harper
and
captain
and
reynolds
were
sitting
next
to
them
they
caught
avelyn
eye
and
smiled
as
she
looked
across
then
concentrated
their
attention
on
the
platform
where
miss
thompson
was
beginning
to
read
the
report
the
principal
first
of
all
described
the
general
work
of
the
school
what
successes
had
been
gained
in
public
examinations
and
what
record
each
form
could
show
the
average
of
marks
was
high
and
both
mistresses
and
pupils
might
be
congratulated
on
their
efforts
during
the
year
after
commenting
on
the
improvement
which
had
also
been
made
in
music
part
singing
drawing
and
painting
miss
thompson
passed
to
the
subject
of
games
i
am
very
glad
to
say
so
ran
the
report
that
on
its
athletic
as
well
as
its
intellectual
side
the
school
is
now
holding
its
own
during
the
winter
season
little
was
done
in
that
respect
but
with
the
spring
a
great
games
revival
took
place
and
the
school
league
was
instituted
the
object
of
which
was
to
win
honours
for
silverside
i
heartily
congratulate
the
league
both
on
the
spirit
of
union
and
school
patriotism
which
it
has
fostered
and
on
the
successes
which
it
has
won
the
cricket
throughout
has
been
most
spirited
and
great
thanks
are
due
to
miss
leslie
and
miss
kennedy
for
their
admirable
help
in
coaching
out
of
six
matches
the
school
scored
four
victories
a
very
creditable
record
for
a
first
season
in
tennis
also
we
are
beginning
to
take
our
place
the
improvement
of
the
general
play
is
most
marked
and
we
hope
to
have
established
a
new
standard
of
energy
and
efficiency
our
champions
were
successful
in
defeating
pendlebury
ladies
college
and
westfield
high
school
a
match
was
also
played
with
the
clifford
grammar
school
which
resulted
in
a
draw
as
we
consider
games
to
be
an
extremely
important
item
in
our
curriculum
we
hope
that
this
strenuous
effort
has
established
a
precedent
in
this
respect
and
that
the
league
will
go
on
to
greater
triumphs
in
the
future
after
the
report
came
the
distribution
of
prizes
and
form
trophies
va
won
a
beautiful
picture
for
a
competition
ivb
gained
the
cup
for
general
improvement
and
the
sixth
the
shield
for
knowledge
of
contemporary
events
while
among
individual
successes
adah
gartley
annie
broadside
maggie
stuart
laura
talbot
and
irma
ridley
were
called
up
to
receive
rewards
of
books
i
am
asked
to
announce
said
the
chairman
that
miss
thompson
and
the
mistresses
have
presented
a
new
gift
to
the
school
this
beautiful
silver
cup
is
to
be
awarded
annually
to
the
girl
who
is
considered
to
have
performed
the
greatest
service
for
silverside
during
the
year
the
first
to
win
it
is
avelyn
watson
to
whose
enterprise
and
energy
in
initiating
the
school
league
much
of
the
present
success
in
games
may
fairly
be
credited
i
congratulate
you
beaming
at
avelyn
as
he
handed
her
the
trophy
that
yours
is
the
first
name
to
be
engraved
upon
the
cup
avelyn
walked
back
to
her
place
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
unexpected
honour
it
was
a
complete
surprise
for
the
mistresses
had
kept
their
secret
well
and
had
allowed
no
word
of
it
to
leak
out
beforehand
the
storm
of
clapping
from
the
girls
showed
that
the
trophy
and
the
choice
of
its
winner
were
equally
appreciated
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
the
genuine
cordiality
of
the
applause
may
i
say
in
conclusion
finished
robson
that
the
part
song
which
will
now
be
rendered
by
the
singing
class
has
been
composed
specially
for
this
occasion
by
a
musician
and
that
henceforward
it
will
take
its
place
as
what
we
might
call
the
national
anthem
of
silverside
to
be
sung
at
all
school
functions
miss
webster
struck
a
chord
on
the
piano
and
the
singing
class
rose
the
sunlight
flooding
through
the
window
shone
on
their
white
dresses
and
the
colours
that
tied
their
hair
there
were
a
few
bars
of
prelude
then
to
a
swinging
rousing
and
most
original
tune
they
sang

out

feel
it
was
you
who
really
won
it
not
i
the
league
was
your
idea
entirely
even
if
i
thought
of
it
i
should
never
have
had
the
courage
to
propose
it
if
it
had
been
for
you
you
inspired
it
all
may
the
cup
stand
on
your
mantelpiece
for
a
whole

only
on
one
condition
that
you
