a
little
ardennois
patrasche
was
a
big
fleming
they
were
both
of
the
same
age
by
length
of
years
yet
one
was
still
young
and
the
other
was
already
old
they
had
dwelt
together
almost
all
their
days
both
were
orphaned
and
destitute
and
owed
their
lives
to
the
same
hand
it
had
been
the
beginning
of
the
tie
between
them
their
first
bond
of
sympathy
and
it
had
strengthened
day
by
day
and
had
grown
with
their
growth
firm
and
indissoluble
until
they
loved
one
another
very
greatly
their
home
was
a
little
hut
on
the
edge
of
a
little
village
a
flemish
village
a
league
from
antwerp
set
amidst
flat
breadths
of
pasture
and
with
long
lines
of
poplars
and
of
alders
bending
in
the
breeze
on
the
edge
of
the
great
canal
which
ran
through
it
it
had
about
a
score
of
houses
and
homesteads
with
shutters
of
bright
green
or
and
roofs
or
black
and
white
and
walls
until
they
shone
in
the
sun
like
snow
in
the
centre
of
the
village
stood
a
windmill
placed
on
a
little
slope
it
was
a
landmark
to
all
the
level
country
round
it
had
once
been
painted
scarlet
sails
and
all
but
that
had
been
in
its
infancy
half
a
century
or
more
earlier
when
it
had
ground
wheat
for
the
soldiers
of
napoleon
and
it
was
now
a
ruddy
brown
tanned
by
wind
and
weather
it
went
queerly
by
fits
and
starts
as
though
rheumatic
and
stiff
in
the
joints
from
age
but
it
served
the
whole
neighborhood
which
would
have
thought
it
almost
as
impious
to
carry
grain
elsewhere
as
to
attend
any
other
religious
service
than
the
mass
that
was
performed
at
the
altar
of
the
little
old
gray
church
with
its
conical
steeple
which
stood
opposite
to
it
and
whose
single
bell
rang
morning
noon
and
night
with
that
strange
subdued
hollow
sadness
which
every
bell
that
hangs
in
the
low
countries
seems
to
gain
as
an
integral
part
of
its
melody
within
sound
of
the
little
melancholy
clock
almost
from
their
birth
upward
they
had
dwelt
together
nello
and
patrasche
in
the
little
hut
on
the
edge
of
the
village
with
the
cathedral
spire
of
antwerp
rising
in
the
beyond
the
great
green
plain
of
seeding
grass
and
spreading
corn
that
stretched
away
from
them
like
a
tideless
changeless
sea
it
was
the
hut
of
a
very
old
man
of
a
very
poor
man
of
old
jehan
daas
who
in
his
time
had
been
a
soldier
and
who
remembered
the
wars
that
had
trampled
the
country
as
oxen
tread
down
the
furrows
and
who
had
brought
from
his
service
nothing
except
a
wound
which
had
made
him
a
cripple
when
old
jehan
daas
had
reached
his
full
eighty
his
daughter
had
died
in
the
ardennes
hard
by
stavelot
and
had
left
him
in
legacy
her
son
the
old
man
could
ill
contrive
to
support
himself
but
he
took
up
the
additional
burden
uncomplainingly
and
it
soon
became
welcome
and
precious
to
him
little

was
but
a
pet
diminutive

nicolas
throve
with
him
and
the
old
man
and
the
little
child
lived
in
the
poor
little
hut
contentedly
it
was
a
very
humble
little
indeed
but
it
was
clean
and
white
as
a
and
stood
in
a
small
plot
of
that
yielded
beans
and
herbs
and
pumpkins
they
were
very
poor
terribly
poor
many
a
day
they
had
nothing
at
all
to
eat
they
never
by
any
chance
had
enough
to
have
had
enough
to
eat
would
have
been
to
have
reached
paradise
at
once
but
the
old
man
was
very
gentle
and
good
to
the
boy
and
the
boy
was
a
beautiful
innocent
truthful
creature
and
they
were
happy
on
a
crust
and
a
few
leaves
of
cabbage
and
asked
no
more
of
earth
or
heaven
save
indeed
that
patrasche
should
be
always
with
them
since
without
patrasche
where
would
they
have
been
for
patrasche
was
their
alpha

omega
their
treasury

gold

their

laid
themselves
down

likewise
patrasche

both
of
them
patrasche
was

very
life
their
very

wrought
in

breed
by
many
generations
of

their

patrasche
had
been
born
of
parents
who
had
labored
hard
all
their
days
over
the
stones
of
the
various
cities
and
the
long
shadowless
weary
roads
of
the
two

and
of

he
had
been
born
to
no
other
heritage
than
those
of
pain
and
of
toil
he
had
been
fed
on
curses
and
baptized
with
blows
why
not
it
was
a
christian
country
and
patrasche
was
but
a
dog
before
he
was
fully
grown
he
had
known
the
bitter
gall
of
the
cart
and
the
collar
before
he
had
entered
his
thirteenth
month
he
had
become
the
property
of
a
who
was
accustomed
to
wander
over
the
land
north
and
south
from
the
blue
sea
to
the
green
mountains
they
sold
him
for
a
small
price
because
he
was
so
young
this
man
was
a
drunkard
and
a
brute
the
life
of
patrasche
was
a
life
of
hell
to
deal
the
tortures
of
hell
on
the
animal
creation
is
a
way
which
the
christians
have
of
showing
their
belief
in
it
his
purchaser
was
a
sullen
brutal
brabantois
who
heaped
his
cart
full
with
pots
and
pans
and
flagons
and
buckets
and
other
wares
of
crockery
and
brass
and
tin
and
left
patrasche
to
draw
the
load
as
best
he
might
whilst
he
himself
lounged
idly
by
the
side
in
fat
and
sluggish
ease
smoking
his
black
pipe
and
stopping
at
every
wineshop
or
café
on
the
road
happily
for
patrasche
or
unhappily
he
was
very
strong
he
came
of
an
iron
race
long
born
and
bred
to
such
cruel
travail
so
that
he
did
not
die
but
managed
to
drag
on
a
wretched
existence
under
the
brutal
burdens
the
scarifying
lashes
the
hunger
the
thirst
the
blows
the
curses
and
the
exhaustion
which
are
the
only
wages
with
which
the
flemings
repay
the
most
patient
and
laborious
of
all
their
victims
one
day
after
two
years
of
this
long
and
deadly
agony
patrasche
was
going
on
as
usual
along
one
of
the
straight
dusty
unlovely
roads
that
lead
to
the
city
of
rubens
it
was
full
midsummer
and
very
warm
his
cart
was
very
heavy
piled
high
with
goods
in
metal
and
in
earthenware
his
owner
sauntered
on
without
noticing
him
otherwise
than
by
the
crack
of
the
whip
as
it
curled
round
his
quivering
loins
the
brabantois
had
paused
to
drink
beer
himself
at
every
wayside
house
but
he
had
forbidden
patrasche
to
stop
a
moment
for
a
draught
from
the
canal
going
along
thus
in
the
full
sun
on
a
scorching
highway
having
eaten
nothing
for
hours
and
which
was
far
worse
to
him
not
having
tasted
water
for
near
twelve
being
blind
with
dust
sore
with
blows
and
stupefied
with
the
merciless
weight
which
dragged
upon
his
loins
patrasche
staggered
and
foamed
a
little
at
the
mouth
and
fell
he
fell
in
the
middle
of
the
white
dusty
road
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
he
was
sick
unto
death
and
motionless
his
master
gave
him
the
only
medicine
in
his
pharmacy
kicks
and
oaths
and
blows
with
a
cudgel
of
oak
which
had
been
often
the
only
food
and
drink
the
only
wage
and
reward
ever
offered
to
him
but
patrasche
was
beyond
the
reach
of
any
torture
or
of
any
curses
patrasche
lay
dead
to
all
appearances
down
in
the
white
powder
of
the
summer
dust
after
a
while
finding
it
useless
to
assail
his
ribs
with
punishment
and
his
ears
with
maledictions
the
brabantois
deeming
life
gone
in
him
or
going
so
nearly
that
his
carcass
was
forever
useless
unless
indeed
some
one
should
strip
it
of
the
skin
for
gloves
cursed
him
fiercely
in
farewell
struck
off
the
leathern
bands
of
the
harness
kicked
his
body
aside
into
the
grass
and
groaning
and
muttering
in
savage
wrath
pushed
the
cart
lazily
along
the
road
and
left
the
dying
dog
for
the
ants
to
sting
and
for
the
crows
to
pick
it
was
the
last
day
before
kermesse
away
at
louvain
and
the
brabantois
was
in
haste
to
reach
the
fair
and
get
a
good
place
for
his
truck
of
brass
wares
he
was
in
fierce
wrath
because
patrasche
had
been
a
strong
and
animal
and
because
he
himself
had
now
the
hard
task
of
pushing
his
charette
all
the
way
to
louvain
but
to
stay
to
look
after
patrasche
never
entered
his
thoughts
the
beast
was
dying
and
useless
and
he
would
steal
to
replace
him
the
first
large
dog
that
he
found
wandering
alone
out
of
sight
of
its
master
patrasche
had
cost
him
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
and
for
two
long
cruel
years
had
made
him
toil
ceaselessly
in
his
service
from
sunrise
to
sunset
through
summer
and
winter
in
fair
weather
and
foul
he
had
got
a
fair
use
and
a
good
profit
out
of
patrasche
being
human
he
was
wise
and
left
the
dog
to
draw
his
last
breath
alone
in
the
ditch
and
have
his
bloodshot
eyes
plucked
out
as
they
might
be
by
the
birds
whilst
he
himself
went
on
his
way
to
beg
and
to
steal
to
eat
and
to
drink
to
dance
and
to
sing
in
the
mirth
at
louvain
a
dying
dog
a
dog
of
the
cart
why
should
he
waste
hours
over
its
agonies
at
peril
of
losing
a
handful
of
copper
coins
at
peril
of
a
shout
of
laughter
patrasche
lay
there
flung
in
the
ditch
it
was
a
busy
road
that
day
and
hundreds
of
people
on
foot
and
on
mules
in
wagons
or
in
carts
went
by
tramping
quickly
and
joyously
on
to
louvain
some
saw
him
most
did
not
even
look
all
passed
on
a
dead
dog
more
or
less
it
was
nothing
in
brabant
it
would
be
nothing
anywhere
in
the
world
illustration
after
a
time
among
the
there
came
a
little
old
man
who
was
bent
and
lame
and
very
feeble
he
was
in
no
guise
for
feasting
he
was
very
poorly
and
miserably
clad
and
he
dragged
his
silent
way
slowly
through
the
dust
among
the
he
looked
at
patrasche
paused
wondered
turned
aside
then
kneeled
down
in
the
rank
grass
and
weeds
of
the
ditch
and
surveyed
the
dog
with
kindly
eyes
of
pity
there
was
with
him
a
little
rosy
child
of
a
few
years
old
who
pattered
in
amidst
the
bushes
for
him
and
stood
gazing
with
a
pretty
seriousness
upon
the
poor
great
quiet
beast
thus
it
was
that
these
two
first
met
the
little
nello
and
the
big
patrasche
the
upshot
of
that
day
was
that
old
jehan
daas
with
much
laborious
effort
drew
the
sufferer
homeward
to
his
own
little
hut
which
was
a
stone
throw
off
amidst
the
fields
and
there
tended
him
with
so
much
care
that
the
sickness
which
had
been
a
brain
seizure
brought
on
by
heat
and
thirst
and
exhaustion
with
time
and
shade
and
rest
passed
away
and
health
and
strength
returned
and
patrasche
staggered
up
again
upon
his
four
stout
tawny
legs
now
for
many
weeks
he
had
been
useless
powerless
sore
near
to
death
but
all
this
time
he
had
heard
no
rough
word
had
felt
no
harsh
touch
but
only
the
pitying
murmurs
of
the
child
voice
and
the
soothing
caress
of
the
old
man
hand
in
his
sickness
they
too
had
grown
to
care
for
him
this
lonely
man
and
the
little
happy
child
he
had
a
corner
of
the
hut
with
a
heap
of
dry
grass
for
his
bed
and
they
had
learned
to
listen
eagerly
for
his
breathing
in
the
dark
night
to
tell
them
that
he
lived
and
when
he
first
was
well
enough
to
essay
a
loud
hollow
broken
bay
they
laughed
aloud
and
almost
wept
together
for
joy
at
such
a
sign
of
his
sure
restoration
and
little
nello
in
delighted
glee
hung
round
his
rugged
neck
with
chains
of
marguerites
and
kissed
him
with
fresh
and
ruddy
lips
so
then
when
patrasche
arose
himself
again
strong
big
gaunt
powerful
his
great
wistful
eyes
had
a
gentle
astonishment
in
them
that
there
were
no
curses
to
rouse
him
and
no
blows
to
drive
him
and
his
heart
awakened
to
a
mighty
love
which
never
wavered
once
in
its
fidelity
whilst
life
abode
with
him
but
patrasche
being
a
dog
was
grateful
patrasche
lay
pondering
long
with
grave
tender
musing
brown
eyes
watching
the
movements
of
his
friends
now
the
old
soldier
jehan
daas
could
do
nothing
for
his
living
but
limp
about
a
little
with
a
small
cart
with
which
he
carried
daily
the
of
those
happier
neighbors
who
owned
cattle
away
into
the
town
of
antwerp
the
villagers
gave
him
the
employment
a
little
out
of
charity
more
because
it
suited
them
well
to
send
their
milk
into
the
town
by
so
honest
a
carrier
and
bide
at
home
themselves
to
look
after
their
gardens
their
cows
their
poultry
or
their
little
fields
but
it
was
becoming
hard
work
for
the
old
man
he
was
and
antwerp
was
a
good
league
off
or
more
patrasche
watched
the
come
and
go
that
one
day
when
he
had
got
well
and
was
lying
in
the
sun
with
the
wreath
of
marguerites
round
his
tawny
neck
the
next
morning
patrasche
before
the
old
man
had
touched
the
cart
arose
and
walked
to
it
and
placed
himself
betwixt
its
handles
and
testified
as
plainly
as
dumb
show
could
do
his
desire
and
his
ability
to
work
in
return
for
the
bread
of
charity
that
he
had
eaten
jehan
daas
resisted
long
for
the
old
man
was
one
of
those
who
thought
it
a
foul
shame
to
bind
dogs
to
labor
for
which
nature
never
formed
them
but
patrasche
would
not
be
gainsaid
finding
they
did
not
harness
him
he
tried
to
draw
the
cart
onward
with
his
teeth
at
length
jehan
daas
gave
way
vanquished
by
the
persistence
and
the
gratitude
of
this
creature
whom
he
had
succored
he
fashioned
his
cart
so
that
patrasche
could
run
in
it
and
this
he
did
every
morning
of
his
life
thenceforward
when
the
winter
came
jehan
daas
thanked
the
blessed
fortune
that
had
brought
him
to
the
dying
dog
in
the
ditch
that
of
louvain
for
he
was
very
old
and
he
grew
feebler
with
each
year
and
he
would
ill
have
known
how
to
pull
his
load
of
over
the
snows
and
through
the
deep
ruts
in
the
mud
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
strength
and
the
industry
of
the
animal
he
had
befriended
as
for
patrasche
it
seemed
heaven
to
him
after
the
frightful
burdens
that
his
old
master
had
compelled
him
to
strain
under
at
the
call
of
the
whip
at
every
step
it
seemed
nothing
to
him
but
amusement
to
step
out
with
this
little
light
green
cart
with
its
bright
brass
cans
by
the
side
of
the
gentle
old
man
who
always
paid
him
with
a
tender
caress
and
with
a
kindly
word
besides
his
work
was
over
by
three
or
four
in
the
day
and
after
that
time
he
was
free
to
do
as
he
would
to
stretch
himself
to
sleep
in
the
sun
to
wander
in
the
fields
to
romp
with
the
young
child
or
to
play
with
his
patrasche
was
very
happy
fortunately
for
his
peace
his
former
owner
was
killed
in
a
drunken
brawl
at
the
kermesse
of
mechlin
and
so
sought
not
after
him
nor
disturbed
him
in
his
new
and
home
illustration
illustration
a
few
years
later
old
jehan
daas
who
had
always
been
a
cripple
became
so
paralyzed
with
rheumatism
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
out
with
the
cart
any
more
then
little
nello
being
now
grown
to
his
sixth
year
of
age
and
knowing
the
town
well
from
having
accompanied
his
grandfather
so
many
times
took
his
place
beside
the
cart
and
sold
the
milk
and
received
the
coins
in
exchange
and
brought
them
back
to
their
respective
owners
with
a
pretty
grace
and
seriousness
which
charmed
all
who
beheld
him
the
little
ardennois
was
a
beautiful
child
with
dark
grave
tender
eyes
and
a
lovely
bloom
upon
his
face
and
fair
locks
that
clustered
to
his
throat
and
many
an
artist
sketched
the
group
as
it
went
by
him
the
green
cart
with
the
brass
flagons
of
teniers
and
mieris
and
van
tal
and
the
great
massive
dog
with
his
belled
harness
that
chimed
cheerily
as
he
went
and
the
small
figure
that
ran
beside
him
which
had
little
white
feet
in
great
wooden
shoes
and
a
soft
grave
innocent
happy
face
like
the
little
fair
children
of
rubens
nello
and
patrasche
did
the
work
so
well
and
so
joyfully
together
that
jehan
daas
himself
when
the
summer
came
and
he
was
better
again
had
no
need
to
stir
out
but
could
sit
in
the
doorway
in
the
sun
and
see
them
go
forth
through
the
garden
wicket
and
then
doze
and
dream
and
pray
a
little
and
then
awake
again
as
the
clock
tolled
three
and
watch
for
their
return
and
on
their
return
patrasche
would
shake
himself
free
of
his
harness
with
a
bay
of
glee
and
nello
would
recount
with
pride
the
doings
of
the
day
and
they
would
all
go
in
together
to
their
meal
of
rye
bread
and
milk
or
soup
and
would
see
the
shadows
lengthen
over
the
great
plain
and
see
the
twilight
veil
the
fair
cathedral
spire
and
then
lie
down
together
to
sleep
peacefully
while
the
old
man
said
a
prayer
so
the
days
and
the
years
went
on
and
the
lives
of
nello
and
patrasche
were
happy
innocent
and
healthful
in
the
spring
and
summer
especially
were
they
glad
flanders
is
not
a
lovely
land
and
around
the
burgh
of
rubens
it
is
perhaps
least
lovely
of
all
corn
and
colza
pasture
and
plough
succeed
each
other
on
the
characterless
plain
in
wearying
repetition
and
save
by
some
gaunt
gray
tower
with
its
peal
of
pathetic
bells
or
some
figure
coming
athwart
the
fields
made
picturesque
by
a
gleaner
bundle
or
a
woodman
fagot
there
is
no
change
no
variety
no
beauty
anywhere
and
he
who
has
dwelt
upon
the
mountains
or
amidst
the
forests
feels
oppressed
as
by
imprisonment
with
the
tedium
and
the
endlessness
of
that
vast
and
dreary
level
but
it
is
green
and
very
fertile
and
it
has
wide
horizons
that
have
a
certain
charm
of
their
own
even
in
their
dulness
and
monotony
and
among
the
rushes
by
the
the
flowers
grow
and
the
trees
rise
tall
and
fresh
where
the
barges
glide
with
their
great
hulks
black
against
the
sun
and
their
little
green
barrels
and
flags
gay
against
the
leaves
anyway
there
is
greenery
and
breadth
of
space
enough
to
be
as
good
as
beauty
to
a
child
and
a
dog
and
these
two
asked
no
better
when
their
work
was
done
than
to
lie
buried
in
the
lush
grasses
on
the
side
of
the
canal
and
watch
the
cumbrous
vessels
drifting
by
and
bring
the
crisp
salt
smell
of
the
sea
among
the
blossoming
scents
of
the
country
summer
true
in
the
winter
it
was
harder
and
they
had
to
rise
in
the
darkness
and
the
bitter
cold
and
they
had
seldom
as
much
as
they
could
have
eaten
any
day
and
the
hut
was
scarce
better
than
a
shed
when
the
nights
were
cold
although
it
looked
so
pretty
in
warm
weather
buried
in
a
great
kindly
clambering
vine
that
never
bore
fruit
indeed
but
which
covered
it
with
luxuriant
green
tracery
all
through
the
months
of
blossom
and
harvest
in
winter
the
winds
found
many
holes
in
the
walls
of
the
poor
little
hut
and
the
vine
was
black
and
leafless
and
the
bare
lands
looked
very
bleak
and
drear
without
and
sometimes
within
the
floor
was
flooded
and
then
frozen
in
winter
it
was
hard
and
the
snow
numbed
the
little
white
limbs
of
nello
and
the
icicles
cut
the
brave
untiring
feet
of
patrasche
but
even
then
they
were
never
heard
to
lament
either
of
them
the
child
wooden
shoes
and
the
dog
four
legs
would
trot
manfully
together
over
the
frozen
fields
to
the
chime
of
the
bells
on
the
harness
and
then
sometimes
in
the
streets
of
antwerp
some
housewife
would
bring
them
a
bowl
of
soup
and
a
handful
of
bread
or
some
kindly
trader
would
throw
some
billets
of
fuel
into
the
little
cart
as
it
went
homeward
or
some
woman
in
their
own
village
would
bid
them
keep
a
share
of
the
milk
they
carried
for
their
own
food
and
they
would
run
over
the
white
lands
through
the
early
darkness
bright
and
happy
and
burst
with
a
shout
of
joy
into
their
home
so
on
the
whole
it
was
well
with
them
very
well
and
patrasche
meeting
on
the
highway
or
in
the
public
streets
the
many
dogs
who
toiled
from
daybreak
into
nightfall
paid
only
with
blows
and
curses
and
loosened
from
the
shafts
with
a
kick
to
starve
and
freeze
as
best
they
might
patrasche
in
his
heart
was
very
grateful
to
his
fate
and
thought
it
the
fairest
and
the
kindliest
the
world
could
hold
though
he
was
often
very
hungry
indeed
when
he
lay
down
at
night
though
he
had
to
work
in
the
heats
of
summer
noons
and
the
rasping
chills
of
winter
dawns
though
his
feet
were
often
tender
with
wounds
from
the
sharp
edges
of
the
jagged
pavement
though
he
had
to
perform
tasks
beyond
his
strength
and
against
his
nature
yet
he
was
grateful
and
content
he
did
his
duty
with
each
day
and
the
eyes
that
he
loved
smiled
down
on
him
it
was
sufficient
for
patrasche
illustration
there
was
only
one
thing
which
caused
patrasche
any
uneasiness
in
his
life
and
it
was
this
antwerp
as
all
the
world
knows
is
full
at
every
turn
of
old
piles
of
stones
dark
and
ancient
and
majestic
standing
in
crooked
courts
jammed
against
gateways
and
taverns
rising
by
the
water
edge
with
bells
ringing
above
them
in
the
air
and
ever
and
again
out
of
their
arched
doors
a
swell
of
music
pealing
there
they
remain
the
grand
old
sanctuaries
of
the
past
shut
in
amidst
the
squalor
the
hurry
the
crowds
the
unloveliness
and
the
commerce
of
the
modern
world
and
all
day
long
the
clouds
drift
and
the
birds
circle
and
the
winds
sigh
around
them
and
beneath
the
earth
at
their
feet
there
sleeps
rubens
and
the
greatness
of
the
mighty
master
still
rests
upon
antwerp
and
wherever
we
turn
in
its
narrow
streets
his
glory
lies
therein
so
that
all
mean
things
are
thereby
transfigured
and
as
we
pace
slowly
through
the
winding
ways
and
by
the
edge
of
the
stagnant
water
and
through
the
noisome
courts
his
spirit
abides
with
us
and
the
heroic
beauty
of
his
visions
is
about
us
and
the
stones
that
once
felt
his
footsteps
and
bore
his
shadow
seem
to
arise
and
speak
of
him
with
living
voices
for
the
city
which
is
the
tomb
of
rubens
still
lives
to
us
through
him
and
him
alone
it
is
so
quiet
there
by
that
great
white
sepulchre
so
quiet
save
only
when
the
organ
peals
and
the
choir
cries
aloud
the
salve
regina
or
the
kyrie
eleison
sure
no
artist
ever
had
a
greater
gravestone
than
that
pure
marble
sanctuary
gives
to
him
in
the
heart
of
his
birthplace
in
the
chancel
of
jacques
without
rubens
what
were
antwerp
a
dirty
dusky
bustling
mart
which
no
man
would
ever
care
to
look
upon
save
the
traders
who
do
business
on
its
wharves
with
rubens
to
the
whole
world
of
men
it
is
a
sacred
name
a
sacred
soil
a
bethlehem
where
a
god
of
art
saw
light
a
golgotha
where
a
god
of
art
lies
dead
o
nations
closely
should
you
treasure
your
great
men
for
by
them
alone
will
the
future
know
of
you
flanders
in
her
generations
has
been
wise
in
his
life
she
glorified
this
greatest
of
her
sons
and
in
his
death
she
magnifies
his
name
but
her
wisdom
is
very
rare
now
the
trouble
of
patrasche
was
this
into
these
great
sad
piles
of
stones
that
reared
their
melancholy
majesty
above
the
crowded
roofs
the
child
nello
would
many
and
many
a
time
enter
and
disappear
through
their
dark
arched
portals
whilst
patrasche
left
without
upon
the
pavement
would
wearily
and
vainly
ponder
on
what
could
be
the
charm
which
thus
allured
from
him
his
inseparable
and
beloved
companion
once
or
twice
he
did
essay
to
see
for
himself
clattering
up
the
steps
with
his
behind
him
but
thereon
he
had
been
always
sent
back
again
summarily
by
a
tall
custodian
in
black
clothes
and
silver
chains
of
office
and
fearful
of
bringing
his
little
master
into
trouble
he
desisted
and
remained
couched
patiently
before
the
churches
until
such
time
as
the
boy
reappeared
it
was
not
the
fact
of
his
going
into
them
which
disturbed
patrasche
he
knew
that
people
went
to
church
all
the
village
went
to
the
small
tumbledown
gray
pile
opposite
the
red
windmill
what
troubled
him
was
that
little
nello
always
looked
strangely
when
he
came
out
always
very
flushed
or
very
pale
and
whenever
he
returned
home
after
such
visitations
would
sit
silent
and
dreaming
not
caring
to
play
but
gazing
out
at
the
evening
skies
beyond
the
line
of
the
canal
very
subdued
and
almost
sad
what
was
it
wondered
patrasche
he
thought
it
could
not
be
good
or
natural
for
the
little
lad
to
be
so
grave
and
in
his
dumb
fashion
he
tried
all
he
could
to
keep
nello
by
him
in
the
sunny
fields
or
in
the
busy
but
to
the
churches
nello
would
go
most
often
of
all
would
he
go
to
the
great
cathedral
and
patrasche
left
without
on
the
stones
by
the
iron
fragments
of
quentin
matsys
gate
would
stretch
himself
and
yawn
and
sigh
and
even
howl
now
and
then
all
in
vain
until
the
doors
closed
and
the
child
perforce
came
forth
again
and
winding
his
arms
about
the
dog
neck
would
kiss
him
on
his
broad
forehead
and
murmur
always
the
same
words
if
i
could
only
see
them
patrasche
if
i
could
only
see
them
what
were
they
pondered
patrasche
looking
up
with
large
wistful
sympathetic
eyes
one
day
when
the
custodian
was
out
of
the
way
and
the
doors
left
ajar
he
got
in
for
a
moment
after
his
little
friend
and
saw
they
were
two
great
covered
pictures
on
either
side
of
the
choir
nello
was
kneeling
rapt
as
in
an
ecstasy
before
the
of
the
assumption
and
when
he
noticed
patrasche
and
rose
and
drew
the
dog
gently
out
into
the
air
his
face
was
wet
with
tears
and
he
looked
up
at
the
veiled
places
as
he
passed
them
and
murmured
to
his
companion
it
is
so
terrible
not
to
see
them
patrasche
just
because
one
is
poor
and
can
not
pay
he
never
meant
that
the
poor
should
not
see
them
when
he
painted
them
i
am
sure
he
would
have
had
us
see
them
any
day
every
day
that
i
am
sure
and
they
keep
them
shrouded
there
shrouded
in
the
dark
the
beautiful
things
and
they
never
feel
the
light
and
no
eyes
look
on
them
unless
rich
people
come
and
pay
if
i
could
only
see
them
i
would
be
content
to
die
but
he
could
not
see
them
and
patrasche
could
not
help
him
for
to
gain
the
silver
piece
that
the
church
exacts
as
the
price
for
looking
on
the
glories
of
the
elevation
of
the
cross
and
the
descent
of
the
cross
was
a
thing
as
utterly
beyond
the
powers
of
either
of
them
as
it
would
have
been
to
scale
the
heights
of
the
cathedral
spire
they
had
never
so
much
as
a
sou
to
spare
if
they
cleared
enough
to
get
a
little
wood
for
the
stove
a
little
broth
for
the
pot
it
was
the
utmost
they
could
do
and
yet
the
heart
of
the
child
was
set
in
sore
and
endless
longing
upon
beholding
the
greatness
of
the
two
veiled
rubens
illustration
tree
illustration
scenery
the
whole
soul
of
the
little
ardennois
thrilled
and
stirred
with
an
absorbing
passion
for
art
going
on
his
ways
through
the
old
city
in
the
early
days
before
the
sun
or
the
people
had
risen
nello
who
looked
only
a
little
with
a
great
dog
drawing
milk
to
sell
from
door
to
door
was
in
a
heaven
of
dreams
whereof
rubens
was
the
god
nello
cold
and
hungry
with
stockingless
feet
in
wooden
shoes
and
the
winter
winds
blowing
among
his
curls
and
lifting
his
poor
thin
garments
was
in
a
rapture
of
meditation
wherein
all
that
he
saw
was
the
beautiful
fair
face
of
the
mary
of
the
assumption
with
the
waves
of
her
golden
hair
lying
upon
her
shoulders
and
the
light
of
an
eternal
sun
shining
down
upon
her
brow
nello
reared
in
poverty
and
buffeted
by
fortune
and
untaught
in
letters
and
unheeded
by
men
had
the
compensation
or
the
curse
which
is
called
genius
no
one
knew
it
he
as
little
as
any
no
one
knew
it
only
indeed
patrasche
who
being
with
him
always
saw
him
draw
with
chalk
upon
the
stones
any
and
every
thing
that
grew
or
breathed
heard
him
on
his
little
bed
of
hay
murmur
all
manner
of
timid
pathetic
prayers
to
the
spirit
of
the
great
master
watched
his
gaze
darken
and
his
face
radiate
at
the
evening
glow
of
sunset
or
the
rosy
rising
of
the
dawn
and
felt
many
and
many
a
time
the
tears
of
a
strange
nameless
pain
and
joy
mingled
together
fall
hotly
from
the
bright
young
eyes
upon
his
own
wrinkled
yellow
forehead
i
should
go
to
my
grave
quite
content
if
i
thought
nello

when
thou
growest
a
man
thou
couldst
own
this
hut
and
the
little
plot
of
ground
and
labor
for
thyself
and
be
called
baas
by
thy
neighbors
said
the
old
man
jehan
many
an
hour
from
his
bed
for
to
own
a
bit
of
soil
and
to
be
called
baas
master
by
the
hamlet

to
have
achieved
the
highest
ideal
of
a
flemish
peasant
and
the
old
soldier
who
had
wandered
over
all
the
earth
in
his
youth
and
had
brought
nothing
back
deemed
in
his
old
age
that
to
live
and
die
on
one
spot
in
contented
humility
was
the
fairest
fate
he
could
desire
for
his
darling
but
nello
said
nothing
the
same
leaven
was
working
in
him
that

other
times
begat
rubens
and
jordaens
and
the

and
all
their
wondrous
tribe
and
in

the

artist
of

whose
genius
is
too
near
us
for
us
aright
to
measure
its
divinity

dreamed
of
other
things
in
the
future
than
of
tilling
the
little
rood
of
earth
and
living
under
the
wattle
roof
and
being
called
baas
by
neighbors
a
little
poorer
or
a
little
less
poor
than
himself

cathedral

where
it
rose
beyond
the
fields
in
the
ruddy
evening
skies
or
in
the
dim
gray
misty
mornings
said
other
things
to
him
than
this
but
these
he
told
only
to
patrasche
whispering
childlike
his
fancies
in
the
dog
ear
when
they
went
together
at
their
work
through
the
fogs
of
the
daybreak
or
lay
together
at
their
rest
among
the
rustling
rushes
by
the
water
side
for
such
dreams
are
not
easily
shaped
into
speech
to
awake
the
slow
sympathies
of
human
auditors
and
they
would
only
have
sorely
perplexed
and
troubled
the
poor
old
man
bedridden
in
his
corner
who
for
his
part
whenever
he
had
trodden
the
streets
of
antwerp
had
thought
the
daub
of
blue
and
red
that
they
called
a
madonna
on
the
walls
of
the
where
he
drank
his
sou
worth
of
black
beer
quite
as
good
as
any
of
the
famous
for
which
the
stranger
folk
travelled
far
and
wide
into
flanders
from
every
land
on
which
the
good
sun
shone
there
was
only
one
other
beside
patrasche
to
whom
nello
could
talk
at
all
of
his
daring
fantasies
this
other
was
little
alois
who
lived
at
the
old
red
mill
on
the
grassy
mound
and
whose
father
the
miller
was
the
husbandman
in
all
the
village
little
alois
was
only
a
pretty
baby
with
soft
round
rosy
features
made
lovely
by
those
sweet
dark
eyes
that
the
spanish
rule
has
left
in
so
many

flemish

of
the

played
in

ran
in
the

they
gathered
the

and
they
often
sat

she
had
neither

her

in

at

she
had
as
many
gilded
nuts
and
agni

in
sugar
as
her
hands
could
hold
and
when
she
went
up
for
her
first
communion
her
flaxen
curls
were
covered
with
a
cap
of
richest
mechlin
lace
which
had
been
her
mother
and
her
grandmother
before
it
came
to
her

already
though
she
had
but
twelve
years
of
the
good
wife
she
would
be
for
their
sons
to
woo
and
win
but
she
herself
was
a
little
gay
simple
child
in
nowise
conscious
of
her
heritage
and
she
loved
no
playfellows
so
well
as

couple
walking
one
day
her
father
baas
cogez
a
good
man
but
somewhat
stern
came
on
a
pretty
group
in
the
long
meadow
behind
the
mill
where
the
aftermath
had
that
day
been
cut
it
was
his
little
daughter
sitting
amidst
the
hay
with
the
great
tawny
head
of
patrasche
on
her
lap
and
many
wreaths
of
poppies
and
blue
round
them
both
on
a
clean
smooth
slab
of
pine
wood
the
boy
nello
drew
their
likeness
with
a
stick
of
charcoal
the
miller
stood
and
looked
at
the
portrait
with
tears
in
his
eyes
it
was
so
strangely
like
and
he
loved
his
only
child
closely
and
well
then
he
roughly
chid
the
little
girl
for
idling
there
whilst
her
mother
needed
her
within
and
sent
her
indoors
crying
and
afraid
then
turning
he
snatched
the
wood
from
nello
hands
dost
do
much
of
such
folly
he
asked
but
there
was
a
tremble
in
his
voice
nello
colored
and
hung
his
head
i
draw
everything
i
see
he
murmured
the
miller
was
silent
then
he
stretched
his
hand
out
with
a
franc
in
it
it
is
folly
as
i
say
and
evil
waste
of
time
nevertheless
it
is
like
alois
and
will
please
the
take
this
silver
bit
for
it
and
leave
it
for
me
the
color
died
out
of
the
face
of
the
young
ardennois
he
lifted
his
head
and
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
keep
your
money
and
the
portrait
both
baas
cogez
he
said
simply
you
have
been
often
good
to
me
then
he
called
patrasche
to
him
and
walked
away
across
the
field
i
could
have
seen
them
with
that
franc
he
murmured
to
patrasche
but
i
could
not
sell
her
picture
not
even
for
them
baas
cogez
went
into
his
sore
troubled
in
his
mind
that
lad
must
not
be
so
much
with
alois
he
said
to
his
wife
that
night
trouble
may
come
of
it
hereafter
he
is
fifteen
now
and
she
is
twelve
and
the
boy
is
comely
of
face
and
form
and
he
is
a
good
lad
and
a
loyal
said
the
housewife
feasting
her
eyes
on
the
piece
of
pine
wood
where
it
was
throned
above
the
chimney
with
a
cuckoo
clock
in
oak
and
a
calvary
in
wax
yea
i
do
not
gainsay
that
said
the
miller
draining
his
pewter
flagon
then
if
what
you
think
of
were
ever
to
come
to
pass
said
the
wife
hesitatingly
would
it
matter
so
much
she
will
have
enough
for
both
and
one
can
not
be
better
than
happy
you
are
a
woman
and
therefore
a
fool
said
the
miller
harshly
striking
his
pipe
on
the
table
the
lad
is
naught
but
a
beggar
and
with
these
painter
fancies
worse
than
a
beggar
have
a
care
that
they
are
not
together
in
the
future
or
i
will
send
the
child
to
the
surer
keeping
of
the
nuns
of
the
sacred
heart
the
poor
mother
was
terrified
and
promised
humbly
to
do
his
will
not
that
she
could
bring
herself
altogether
to
separate
the
child
from
her
favorite
playmate
nor
did
the
miller
even
desire
that
extreme
of
cruelty
to
a
young
lad
who
was
guilty
of
nothing
except
poverty
but
there
were
many
ways
in
which
little
alois
was
kept
away
from
her
chosen
companion
and
nello
being
a
boy
proud
and
quiet
and
sensitive
was
quickly
wounded
and
ceased
to
turn
his
own
steps
and
those
of
patrasche
as
he
had
been
used
to
do
with
every
moment
of
leisure
to
the
old
red
mill
upon
the
slope
what
his
offence
was
he
did
not
know
he
supposed
he
had
in
some
manner
angered
baas
cogez
by
taking
the
portrait
of
alois
in
the
meadow
and
when
the
child
who
loved
him
would
run
to
him
and
nestle
her
hand
in
his
he
would
smile
at
her
very
sadly
and
say
with
a
tender
concern
for
her
before
himself
nay
alois
do
not
anger
your
father
he
thinks
that
i
make
you
idle
dear
and
he
is
not
pleased
that
you
should
be
with
me
he
is
a
good
man
and
loves
you
well
we
will
not
anger
him
alois
but
it
was
with
a
sad
heart
that
he
said
it
and
the
earth
did
not
look
so
bright
to
him
as
it
had
used
to
do
when
he
went
out
at
sunrise
under
the
poplars
down
the
straight
roads
with
patrasche
the
old
red
mill
had
been
a
landmark
to
him
and
he
had
been
used
to
pause
by
it
going
and
coming
for
a
cheery
greeting
with
its
people
as
her
little
flaxen
head
rose
above
the
low
and
her
little
rosy
hands
had
held
out
a
bone
or
a
crust
to
patrasche
now
the
dog
looked
wistfully
at
a
closed
door
and
the
boy
went
on
without
pausing
with
a
pang
at
his
heart
and
the
child
sat
within
with
tears
dropping
slowly
on
the
knitting
to
which
she
was
set
on
her
little
stool
by
the
stove
and
baas
cogez
working
among
his
sacks
and
his
would
harden
his
will
and
say
to
himself
it
is
best
so
the
lad
is
all
but
a
beggar
and
full
of
idle
dreaming
fooleries
who
knows
what
mischief
might
not
come
of
it
in
the
future
so
he
was
wise
in
his
generation
and
would
not
have
the
door
unbarred
except
upon
rare
and
formal
occasion
which
seemed
to
have
neither
warmth
nor
mirth
in
them
to
the
two
children
who
had
been
accustomed
so
long
to
a
daily
gleeful
careless
happy
interchange
of
greeting
speech
and
pastime
with
no
other
watcher
of
their
sports
or
auditor
of
their
fancies
than
patrasche
sagely
shaking
the
brazen
bells
of
his
collar
and
responding
with
all
a
dog
swift
sympathies
to
their
every
change
of
mood
all
this
while
the
little
panel
of
pine
wood
remained
over
the
chimney
in
the
with
the
cuckoo
clock
and
the
waxen
calvary
and
sometimes
it
seemed
to
nello
a
little
hard
that
whilst
his
gift
was
accepted
he
himself
should
be
denied
illustration
but
he
did
not
complain
it
was
his
habit
to
be
quiet
old
jehan
daas
had
said
ever
to
him
we
are
poor
we
must
take
what
god
sends
the
ill
with
the
good
the
poor
can
not
choose
to
which
the
boy
had
always
listened
in
silence
being
reverent
of
his
old
grandfather
but
nevertheless
a
certain
vague
sweet
hope
such
as
beguiles
the
children
of
genius
had
whispered
in
his
heart
yet
the
poor
do
choose
sometimes
choose
to
be
great
so
that
men
can
not
say
them
nay
and
he
thought
so
still
in
his
innocence
and
one
day
when
the
little
alois
finding
him
by
chance
alone
among
the
cornfields
by
the
canal
ran
to
him
and
held
him
close
and
sobbed
piteously
because
the
morrow
would
be
her
saint
day
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
her
life
her
parents
had
failed
to
bid
him
to
the
little
supper
and
romp
in
the
great
barns
with
which
her
was
always
celebrated
nello
had
kissed
her
and
murmured
to
her
in
firm
faith
it
shall
be
different
one
day
alois
one
day
that
little
bit
of
pine
wood
that
your
father
has
of
mine
shall
be
worth
its
weight
in
silver
and
he
will
not
shut
the
door
against
me
then
only
love
me
always
dear
little
alois
only
love
me
always
and
i
will
be
great
and
if
i
do
not
love
you
the
pretty
child
asked
pouting
a
little
through
her
tears
and
moved
by
the
instinctive
coquetries
of
her
sex
nello
eyes
left
her
face
and
wandered
to
the
distance
where
in
the
red
and
gold
of
the
flemish
night
the
cathedral
spire
rose
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
so
sweet
and
yet
so
sad
that
little
alois
was
awed
by
it
i
will
be
great
still
he
said
under
his
breath
great
still
or
die
alois
you
do
not
love
me
said
the
little
spoilt
child
pushing
him
away
but
the
boy
shook
his
head
and
smiled
and
went
on
his
way
through
the
tall
yellow
corn
seeing
as
in
a
vision
some
day
in
a
fair
future
when
he
should
come
into
that
old
familiar
land
and
ask
alois
of
her
people
and
be
not
refused
or
denied
but
received
in
honor
whilst
the
village
folk
should
throng
to
look
upon
him
and
say
in
one
another
ears
dost
see
him
he
is
a
king
among
men
for
he
is
a
great
artist
and
the
world
speaks
his
name
and
yet
he
was
only
our
poor
little
nello
who
was
a
beggar
as
one
may
say
and
only
got
his
bread
by
the
help
of
his
dog
and
he
thought
how
he
would
fold
his
grandsire
in
furs
and
purples
and
portray
him
as
the
old
man
is
portrayed
in
the
family
in
the
chapel
of
jacques
and
of
how
he
would
hang
the
throat
of
patrasche
with
a
collar
of
gold
and
place
him
on
his
right
hand
and
say
to
the
people
this
was
once
my
only
friend
and
of
how
he
would
build
himself
a
great
white
marble
palace
and
make
to
himself
luxuriant
gardens
of
pleasure
on
the
slope
looking
outward
to
where
the
cathedral
spire
rose
and
not
dwell
in
it
himself
but
summon
to
it
as
to
a
home
all
men
young
and
poor
and
friendless
but
of
the
will
to
do
mighty
things
and
of
how
he
would
say
to
them
always
if
they
sought
to
bless
his
name
nay
do
not
thank
me
thank
rubens
without
him
what
should
i
have
been
and
these
dreams
beautiful
impossible
innocent
free
of
all
selfishness
full
of
heroical
worship
were
so
closely
about
him
as
he
went
that
he
was
happy
happy
even
on
this
sad
anniversary
of
saint
day
when
he
and
patrasche
went
home
by
themselves
to
the
little
dark
hut
and
the
meal
of
black
bread
whilst
in
the
all
the
children
of
the
village
sang
and
laughed
and
ate
the
big
round
cakes
of
dijon
and
the
almond
gingerbread
of
brabant
and
danced
in
the
great
barn
to
the
light
of
the
stars
and
the
music
of
flute
and
fiddle
never
mind
patrasche
he
said
with
his
arms
round
the
dog
neck
as
they
both
sat
in
the
door
of
the
hut
where
the
sounds
of
the
mirth
at
the
mill
came
down
to
them
on
the
night
air
never
mind
it
shall
all
be
changed
by
and
by
he
believed
in
the
future
patrasche
of
more
experience
and
of
more
philosophy
thought
that
the
loss
of
the
mill
supper
in
the
present
was
ill
compensated
by
dreams
of
milk
and
honey
in
some
vague
hereafter
and
patrasche
growled
whenever
he
passed
by
baas
cogez
this
is
alois
is
it
not
said
the
old
man
daas
that
night
from
the
corner
where
he
was
stretched
upon
his
bed
of
sacking
the
boy
gave
a
gesture
of
assent
he
wished
that
the
old
man
memory
had
erred
a
little
instead
of
keeping
such
sure
account
and
why
not
there
his
grandfather
pursued
thou
hast
never
missed
a
year
before
nello
thou
art
too
sick
to
leave
murmured
the
lad
bending
his
handsome
head
over
the
bed
tut
tut
mother
nulette
would
have
come
and
sat
with
me
as
she
does
scores
of
times
what
is
the
cause
nello
the
old
man
persisted
thou
surely
hast
not
had
ill
words
with
the
little
one
nay
grandfather
never
said
the
boy
quickly
with
a
hot
color
in
his
bent
face
simply
and
truly
baas
cogez
did
not
have
me
asked
this
year
he
has
taken
some
whim
against
me
but
thou
hast
done
nothing
wrong
that
i
know
nothing
i
took
the
portrait
of
alois
on
a
piece
of
pine
that
is
all
ah
the
old
man
was
silent
the
truth
suggested
itself
to
him
with
the
boy
innocent
answer
he
was
tied
to
a
bed
of
dried
leaves
in
the
corner
of
a
wattle
hut
but
he
had
not
wholly
forgotten
what
the
ways
of
the
world
were
like
he
drew
nello
fair
head
fondly
to
his
breast
with
a
tenderer
gesture
thou
art
very
poor
my
child
he
said
with
a
quiver
the
more
in
his
aged
trembling
voice
so
poor
it
is
very
hard
for
thee
nay
i
am
rich
murmured
nello
and
in
his
innocence
he
thought
so
rich
with
the
imperishable
powers
that
are
mightier
than
the
might
of
kings
and
he
went
and
stood
by
the
door
of
the
hut
in
the
quiet
autumn
night
and
watched
the
stars
troop
by
and
the
tall
poplars
bend
and
shiver
in
the
wind
all
the
casements
of
the
were
lighted
and
every
now
and
then
the
notes
of
the
flute
came
to
him
the
tears
fell
down
his
cheeks
for
he
was
but
a
child
yet
he
smiled
for
he
said
to
himself
in
the
future
he
stayed
there
until
all
was
quite
still
and
dark
then
he
and
patrasche
went
within
and
slept
together
long
and
deeply
side
by
side
illustration
now
he
had
a
secret
which
only
patrasche
knew
there
was
a
little
to
the
hut
which
no
one
entered
but
himself
a
dreary
place
but
with
abundant
clear
light
from
the
north
here
he
had
fashioned
himself
rudely
an
easel
in
rough
lumber
and
here
on
a
great
gray
sea
of
stretched
paper
he
had
given
shape
to
one
of
the
innumerable
fancies
which
possessed
his
brain
no
one
had
ever
taught
him
anything
colors
he
had
no
means
to
buy
he
had
gone
without
bread
many
a
time
to
procure
even
the
few
rude
vehicles
that
he
had
here
and
it
was
only
in
black
or
white
that
he
could
fashion
the
things
he
saw
this
great
figure
which
he
had
drawn
here
in
chalk
was
only
an
old
man
sitting
on
a
fallen
tree
only
that
he
had
seen
old
michel
the
woodman
sitting
so
at
evening
many
a
time
he
had
never
had
a
soul
to
tell
him
of
outline
or
perspective
of
anatomy
or
of
shadow
and
yet
he
had
given
all
the
weary
age
all
the
sad
quiet
patience
all
the
rugged
careworn
pathos
of
his
original
and
given
them
so
that
the
old
lonely
figure
was
a
poem
sitting
there
meditative
and
alone
on
the
dead
tree
with
the
darkness
of
the
descending
night
behind
him
it
was
rude
of
course
in
a
way
and
had
many
faults
no
doubt
and
yet
it
was
real
true
in
nature
true
in
art
and
very
mournful
and
in
a
manner
beautiful
patrasche
had
lain
quiet
countless
hours
watching
its
gradual
creation
after
the
labor
of
each
day
was
done
and
he
knew
that
nello
had
a
hope
vain
and
wild
perhaps
but
strongly
cherished
of
sending
this
great
drawing
to
compete
for
a
prize
of
two
hundred
francs
a
year
which
it
was
announced
in
antwerp
would
be
open
to
every
lad
of
talent
scholar
or
peasant
under
eighteen
who
would
attempt
to
win
it
with
some
unaided
work
of
chalk
or
pencil
three
of
the
foremost
artists
in
the
town
of
rubens
were
to
be
the
judges
and
elect
the
victor
according
to
his
merits
all
the
spring
and
summer
and
autumn
nello
had
been
at
work
upon
this
treasure
which
if
triumphant
would
build
him
his
first
step
toward
independence
and
the
mysteries
of
the
art
which
he
blindly
ignorantly
and
yet
passionately
adored
he
said
nothing
to
any
one
his
grandfather
would
not
have
understood
and
little
alois
was
lost
to
him
only
to
patrasche
he
told
all
and
whispered
rubens
would
give
it
me
i
think
if
he
knew
patrasche
thought
so
too
for
he
knew
that
rubens
had
loved
dogs
or
he
had
never
painted
them
with
such
exquisite
fidelity
and
men
who
loved
dogs
were
as
patrasche
knew
always
pitiful
the
drawings
were
to
go
in
on
the
first
day
of
december
and
the
decision
be
given
on
the
so
that
he
who
should
win
might
rejoice
with
all
his
people
at
the
christmas
season
in
the
twilight
of
a
bitter
wintry
day
and
with
a
beating
heart
now
quick
with
hope
now
faint
with
fear
nello
placed
the
great
picture
on
his
little
green
and
took
it
with
the
help
of
patrasche
into
the
town
and
there
left
it
as
enjoined
at
the
doors
of
a
public
building
perhaps
it
is
worth
nothing
at
all
how
can
i
tell
he
thought
with
the
of
a
great
timidity
now
that
he
had
left
it
there
it
seemed
to
him
so
hazardous
so
vain
so
foolish
to
dream
that
he
a
little
lad
with
bare
feet
who
barely
knew
his
letters
could
do
anything
at
which
great
painters
real
artists
could
ever
deign
to
look
yet
he
took
heart
as
he
went
by
the
cathedral
the
lordly
form
of
rubens
seemed
to
rise
from
the
fog
and
the
darkness
and
to
loom
in
its
magnificence
before
him
whilst
the
lips
with
their
kindly
smile
seemed
to
him
to
murmur
nay
have
courage
it
was
not
by
a
weak
heart
and
by
faint
fears
that
i
wrote
my
name
for
all
time
upon
antwerp
nello
ran
home
through
the
cold
night
comforted
he
had
done
his
best
the
rest
must
be
as
god
willed
he
thought
in
that
innocent
unquestioning
faith
which
had
been
taught
him
in
the
little
gray
chapel
among
the
willows
and
the
illustration
the
winter
was
very
sharp
already
that
night
after
they
reached
the
hut
snow
fell
and
fell
for
very
many
days
after
that
so
that
the
paths
and
the
divisions
in
the
fields
were
all
obliterated
and
all
the
smaller
streams
were
frozen
over
and
the
cold
was
intense
upon
the
plains
then
indeed
it
became
hard
work
to
go
round
for
the
milk
while
the
world
was
all
dark
and
carry
it
through
the
darkness
to
the
silent
town
hard
work
especially
for
patrasche
for
the
passage
of
the
years
that
were
only
bringing
nello
a
stronger
youth
were
bringing
him
old
age
and
his
joints
were
stiff
and
his
bones
ached
often
but
he
would
never
give
up
his
share
of
the
labor
nello
would
fain
have
spared
him
and
drawn
the
cart
himself
but
patrasche
would
not
allow
it
all
he
would
ever
permit
or
accept
was
the
help
of
a
thrust
from
behind
to
the
truck
as
it
lumbered
along
through
the
patrasche
had
lived
in
harness
and
he
was
proud
of
it
he
suffered
a
great
deal
sometimes
from
frost
and
the
terrible
roads
and
the
rheumatic
pains
of
his
limbs
but
he
only
drew
his
breath
hard
and
bent
his
stout
neck
and
trod
onward
with
steady
patience
rest
thee
at
home
patrasche
it
is
time
thou
didst
rest
and
i
can
quite
well
push
in
the
cart
by
myself
urged
nello
many
a
morning
but
patrasche
who
understood
him
aright
would
no
more
have
consented
to
stay
at
home
than
a
veteran
soldier
to
shirk
when
the
charge
was
sounding
and
every
day
he
would
rise
and
place
himself
in
his
shafts
and
plod
along
over
the
snow
through
the
fields
that
his
four
round
feet
had
left
their
print
upon
so
many
many
years
one
must
never
rest
till
one
dies
thought
patrasche
and
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
that
time
of
rest
for
him
was
not
very
far
off
his
sight
was
less
clear
than
it
had
been
and
it
gave
him
pain
to
rise
after
the
night
sleep
though
he
would
never
lie
a
moment
in
his
straw
when
once
the
bell
of
the
chapel
tolling
five
let
him
know
that
the
daybreak
of
labor
had
begun
my
poor
patrasche
we
shall
soon
lie
quiet
together
you
and
i
said
old
jehan
daas
stretching
out
to
stroke
the
head
of
patrasche
with
the
old
withered
hand
which
had
always
shared
with
him
its
one
poor
crust
of
bread
and
the
hearts
of
the
old
man
and
the
old
dog
ached
together
with
one
thought
when
they
were
gone
who
would
care
for
their
darling
one
afternoon
as
they
came
back
from
antwerp
over
the
snow
which
had
become
hard
and
smooth
as
marble
over
all
the
flemish
plains
they
found
dropped
in
the
road
a
pretty
little
puppet
a
tambourine
player
all
scarlet
and
gold
about
six
inches
high
and
unlike
greater
personages
when
fortune
lets
them
drop
quite
unspoiled
and
unhurt
by
its
fall
it
was
a
pretty
toy
nello
tried
to
find
its
owner
and
failing
thought
that
it
was
just
the
thing
to
please
alois
it
was
quite
night
when
he
passed
the
he
knew
the
little
window
of
her
room
it
could
be
no
harm
he
thought
if
he
gave
her
his
little
piece
of
they
had
been
playfellows
so
long
there
was
a
shed
with
a
sloping
roof
beneath
her
casement
he
climbed
it
and
tapped
softly
at
the
lattice
there
was
a
little
light
within
the
child
opened
it
and
looked
out
half
frightened
nello
put
the
into
her
hands
here
is
a
doll
i
found
in
the
snow
alois
take
it
he
whispered
take
it
and
god
bless
thee
dear
he
slid
down
from
the
before
she
had
time
to
thank
him
and
ran
off
through
the
darkness
that
night
there
was
a
fire
at
the
mill
outbuildings
and
much
corn
were
destroyed
although
the
mill
itself
and
the
were
unharmed
all
the
village
was
out
in
terror
and
engines
came
tearing
through
the
snow
from
antwerp
the
miller
was
insured
and
would
lose
nothing
nevertheless
he
was
in
furious
wrath
and
declared
aloud
that
the
fire
was
due
to
no
accident
but
to
some
foul
intent
nello
awakened
from
his
sleep
ran
to
help
with
the
rest
baas
cogez
thrust
him
angrily
aside
thou
wert
loitering
here
after
dark
he
said
roughly
i
believe
on
my
soul
that
thou
dost
know
more
of
the
fire
than
any
one
nello
heard
him
in
silence
stupefied
not
supposing
that
any
one
could
say
such
things
except
in
jest
and
not
comprehending
how
any
one
could
pass
a
jest
at
such
a
time
nevertheless
the
miller
said
the
brutal
thing
openly
to
many
of
his
neighbors
in
the
day
that
followed
and
though
no
serious
charge
was
ever
preferred
against
the
lad
it
got
bruited
about
that
nello
had
been
seen
in
the
after
dark
on
some
unspoken
errand
and
that
he
bore
baas
cogez
a
grudge
for
forbidding
his
intercourse
with
little
alois
and
so
the
hamlet
which
followed
the
sayings
of
its
richest
landowner
servilely
and
whose
families
all
hoped
to
secure
the
riches
of
alois
in
some
future
time
for
their
sons
took
the
hint
to
give
grave
looks
and
cold
words
to
old
jehan
daas
grandson
no
one
said
anything
to
him
openly
but
all
the
village
agreed
together
to
humor
the
prejudice
and
at
the
cottages
and
farms
where
nello
and
patrasche
called
every
morning
for
the
milk
for
antwerp
downcast
glances
and
brief
phrases
replaced
to
them
the
broad
smiles
and
cheerful
greetings
to
which
they
had
been
always
used
no
one
really
credited
the
absurd
suspicion
nor
the
outrageous
accusations
born
of
them
but
the
people
were
all
very
poor
and
very
ignorant
and
the
one
rich
man
of
the
place
had
pronounced
against
him
nello
in
his
innocence
and
his
friendlessness
had
no
strength
to
stem
the
popular
tide
thou
art
very
cruel
to
the
lad
the
miller
wife
dared
to
say
weeping
to
her
lord
sure
he
is
an
innocent
lad
and
a
faithful
and
would
never
dream
of
any
such
wickedness
however
sore
his
heart
might
be
but
baas
cogez
being
an
obstinate
man
having
once
said
a
thing
held
to
it
doggedly
though
in
his
innermost
soul
he
knew
well
the
injustice
that
he
was
committing
meanwhile
nello
endured
the
injury
done
against
him
with
a
certain
proud
patience
that
disdained
to
complain
he
only
gave
way
a
little
when
he
was
quite
alone
with
old
patrasche
besides
he
thought
if
it
should
win
they
will
be
sorry
then
perhaps
still
to
a
boy
not
quite
sixteen
and
who
had
dwelt
in
one
little
world
all
his
short
life
and
in
his
childhood
had
been
caressed
and
applauded
on
all
sides
it
was
a
hard
trial
to
have
the
whole
of
that
little
world
turn
against
him
for
naught
especially
hard
in
that
bleak
when
the
only
light
and
warmth
there
could
be
found

beside
the
village
hearths
and
in
the
kindly
greetings
of
neighbors
in
the
all
drew
nearer
to
each
other
all
to
all
except
to
nello
and
patrasche
with
whom
none
now
would
have
anything
to
do
and
who
were
left
to
fare
as
they
might
with
the
old
paralyzed
bedridden
man
in
the
little
cabin
whose
fire
was
often
low
and
whose
board
was
often
without
bread
for
there
was
a
buyer
from
antwerp
who
had
taken
to
drive
his
mule
in
of
a
day
for
the
milk
of
the
various
dairies
and
there
were
only
three
or
four
of
the
people
who
had
refused
his
terms
of
purchase
and
remained
faithful
to
the
little
green
cart
so
that
the
burden
which
patrasche
drew
had
become
very
light
and
the
in
nello
pouch
had
become
alas
very
small
likewise
the
dog
would
stop
as
usual
at
all
the
familiar
gates
which
were
now
closed
to
him
and
look
up
at
them
with
wistful
mute
appeal
and
it
cost
the
neighbors
a
pang
to
shut
their
doors
and
their
hearts
and
let
patrasche
draw
his
cart
on
again
empty
nevertheless
they
did
it
for
they
desired
to
please
baas

close
at

the
weather

very
wild
and
cold

six
feet
deep
and
the
ice
was
firm
enough
to
bear
oxen
and
men
upon
it
everywhere
at
this
season
the
little
village
was
always
gay
and
cheerful

and
took
away
from
life
forever
old
jehan
daas
who
had
never
known
life
aught
save
its
poverty
and
its
pains
he
had
long
been
half
dead
incapable
of
any
movement
except
a
feeble
gesture
and
powerless
for
anything
beyond
a
gentle
word
and
yet
his
loss
fell
on
them
both
with
a
great
horror
in
it
they
mourned
him
passionately
he
had
passed
away
from
them
in
his
sleep
and
when
in
the
gray
dawn
they
learned
their
bereavement
unutterable
solitude
and
desolation
seemed
to
close
around
them
he
had
long
been
only
a
poor
feeble
paralyzed
old
man
who
could
not
raise
a
hand
in
their
defence
but
he
had
loved
them
well
his
smile
had
always
welcomed
their
return
they
mourned
for
him
unceasingly
refusing
to
be
comforted
as
in
the
white
winter
day
they
followed
the
deal

that
held
his
body
to
the
nameless
grave
by
the
little
gray
church
they
were
his
only
mourners
these
two
whom
he
had
left
friendless
upon
earth
the
young
boy
and
the
old
dog
surely
he
will
relent
now
and
let
the
poor
lad
come
hither

the
miller
wife
glancing
at
her
husband
smoking
by
the
hearth
baas

knew
her
thought
but
he
hardened
his
heart
and
would
not
unbar
his
door
as
the
little
humble
funeral
went
by
the
boy

a
beggar
he
said
to
himself
he
shall
not
be
about

the
woman
dared
not
say
anything
aloud
but
when
the
grave
was
closed
and
the
mourners
had
gone
she
put
a
wreath
of
immortelles
into
hands
and
bade
her
go
and
lay
it
reverently
on
the
dark
unmarked
mound
where
the
snow
was
displaced
nello
and
patrasche
went
home
with
broken
hearts
but
even
of
that
poor
melancholy
cheerless
home
they
were
denied
the
consolation
there
was
a
month
rent
for
their
little
home
and
when
nello
had
paid
the
last
sad
service
to
the
dead
he
had
not
a
coin
left
he
went
and
begged
grace
of
the
owner
of
the
hut
a
cobbler
who
went
every
sunday
night
to
drink
his
pint
of
wine
and
smoke
with
baas
cogez
the
cobbler
would
grant
no
mercy
he
was
a
harsh
miserly
man
and
loved
money
he
claimed
in
default
of
his
rent
every
stick
and
stone
every
pot
and
pan
in
the
hut
and
bade
nello
and
patrasche
be
out
of
it
on
the
morrow
now
the
cabin
was
lowly
enough
and
in
some
sense
miserable
enough
and
yet
their
hearts
clove
to
it
with
a
great
affection
they
had
been
so
happy
there
and
in
the
summer
with
its
clambering
vine
and
its
flowering
beans
it
was
so
pretty
and
bright
in
the
midst
of
the
sunlighted
fields
there
life
in
it
had
been
full
of
labor
and
privation
and
yet
they
had
been
so
well
content
so
gay
of
heart
running
together
to
meet
the
old
man
smile
of
welcome
all
night
long
the
boy
and
the
dog
sat
by
the
fireless
hearth
in
the
darkness
drawn
close
together
for
warmth
and
sorrow
their
bodies
were
insensible
to
the
cold
but
their
hearts
seemed
frozen
in
them
when
the
morning
broke
over
the
white
chill
earth
it
was
the
morning
of
christmas
eve
with
a
shudder
nello
clasped
close
to
him
his
only
friend
while
his
tears
fell
hot
and
fast
on
the
dog
frank
forehead
let
us
go
patrasche
dear
dear
patrasche
he
murmured
we
will
not
wait
to
be
kicked
out
let
us
go
patrasche
had
no
will
but
his
and
they
went
sadly
side
by
side
out
from
the
little
place
which
was
so
dear
to
them
both
and
in
which
every
humble
homely
thing
was
to
them
precious
and
beloved
patrasche
drooped
his
head
wearily
as
he
passed
by
his
own
green
cart
it
was
no
longer
his
it
had
to
go
with
the
rest
to
pay
the
rent
and
his
brass
harness
lay
idle
and
glittering
on
the
snow
the
dog
could
have
lain
down
beside
it
and
died
for
very
as
he
went
but
whilst
the
lad
lived
and
needed
him
patrasche
would
not
yield
and
give
way
they
took
the
old
accustomed
road
into
antwerp
the
day
had
yet
scarce
more
than
dawned
most
of
the
shutters
were
still
closed
but
some
of
the
villagers
were
about
they
took
no
notice
whilst
the
dog
and
the
boy
passed
by
them
at
one
door
nello
paused
and
looked
wistfully
within
his
grandfather
had
done
many
a
kindly
turn
in
neighbor
service
to
the
people
who
dwelt
there
would
you
give
patrasche
a
crust
he
said
timidly
he
is
old
and
he
has
had
nothing
since
last
forenoon
the
woman
shut
the
door
hastily
murmuring
some
vague
saying
about
wheat
and
rye
being
very
dear
that
season
the
boy
and
the
dog
went
on
again
wearily
they
asked
no
more
by
slow
and
painful
ways
they
reached
antwerp
as
the
chimes
tolled
ten
if
i
had
anything
about
me
i
could
sell
to
get
him
bread
thought
nello
but
he
had
nothing
except
the
wisp
of
linen
and
serge
that
covered
him
and
his
pair
of
wooden
shoes
patrasche
understood
and
nestled
his
nose
into
the
lad
hand
as
though
to
pray
him
not
to
be
disquieted
for
any
woe
or
want
of
his
the
winner
of
the
was
to
be
proclaimed
at
noon
and
to
the
public
building
where
he
had
left
his
treasure
nello
made
his
way
on
the
steps
and
in
the
there
was
a
crowd
of
youths
some
of
his
age
some
older
all
with
parents
or
relatives
or
friends
his
heart
was
sick
with
fear
as
he
went
among
them
holding
patrasche
close
to
him
the
great
bells
of
the
city
clashed
out
the
hour
of
noon
with
brazen
clamor
the
doors
of
the
inner
hall
were
opened
the
eager
panting
throng
rushed
in
it
was
known
that
the
selected
picture
would
be
raised
above
the
rest
upon
a
wooden
a
mist
obscured
nello
sight
his
head
swam
his
limbs
almost
failed
him
when
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
the
drawing
raised
on
high
it
was
not
his
own
a
slow
sonorous
voice
was
proclaiming
aloud
that
victory
had
been
adjudged
to
stephen
kiesslinger
born
in
the
burgh
of
antwerp
son
of
a
wharfinger
in
that
town
when
nello
recovered
his
consciousness
he
was
lying
on
the
stones
without
and
patrasche
was
trying
with
every
art
he
knew
to
call
him
back
to
life
in
the
distance
a
throng
of
the
youths
of
antwerp
were
shouting
around
their
successful
comrade
and
escorting
him
with
acclamations
to
his
home
upon
the
quay
the
boy
staggered
to
his
feet
and
drew
the
dog
into
his
embrace
it
is
all
over
dear
patrasche
he
murmured
all
over
he
rallied
himself
as
best
he
could
for
he
was
weak
from
fasting
and
retraced
his
steps
to
the
village
patrasche
paced
by
his
side
with
his
head
drooping
and
his
old
limbs
feeble
from
hunger
and
sorrow
the
snow
was
falling
fast
a
keen
hurricane
blew
from
the
north
it
was
bitter
as
death
on
the
plains
it
took
them
long
to
traverse
the
familiar
path
and
the
bells
were
sounding
four
of
the
clock
as
they
approached
the
hamlet
suddenly
patrasche
paused
arrested
by
a
scent
in
the
snow
scratched
whined
and
drew
out
with
his
teeth
a
small
case
of
brown
leather
he
held
it
up
to
nello
in
the
darkness
where
they
were
there
stood
a
little
calvary
and
a
lamp
burned
dully
under
the
cross
the
boy
mechanically
turned
the
case
to
the
light
on
it
was
the
name
of
baas
cogez
and
within
it
were
notes
for
two
thousand
francs
the
sight
roused
the
lad
a
little
from
his
stupor
he
thrust
it
in
his
shirt
and
stroked
patrasche
and
drew
him
onward
the
dog
looked
up
wistfully
in
his
face
nello
made
straight
for
the
and
went
to
the
and
struck
on
its
panels
the
miller
wife
opened
it
weeping
with
little
alois
clinging
close
to
her
skirts
is
it
thee
thou
poor
lad
she
said
kindly
through
her
tears
get
thee
gone
ere
the
baas

thee
we
are
in
sore
trouble
he
is
out
seeking
for
a
power
of
money
that
he
has
let
fall
riding
homeward
and
in
this
snow
he
never
will
find
it
and
god
knows
it
will
go
nigh
to
ruin
us
it
is
heaven
own
judgment
for
the
things
we
have
done
to
thee
nello
put
the
in
her
hand
and
called
patrasche
within
the
house
patrasche
found
the
money
he
said
quickly
tell
baas
cogez
so
i
think
he
will
not
deny
the
dog
shelter
and
food
in
his
old
age
keep
him
from
pursuing
me
and
i
pray
of
you
to
be
good
to
him
ere
either
woman
or
dog
knew
what
he
meant
he
had
stooped
and
kissed
patrasche
then
closed
the
door
hurriedly
and
disappeared
in
the
gloom
of
the
fast
falling
night
the
woman
and
the
child
stood
speechless
with
joy
and
fear
patrasche
vainly
spent
the
fury
of
his
anguish
against
the
oak
of
the
barred
they
did
not
dare
unbar
the
door
and
let
him
forth
they
tried
all
they
could
to
solace
him
they
brought
him
sweet
cakes
and
juicy
meats
they
tempted
him
with
the
best
they
had
they
tried
to
lure
him
to
abide
by
the
warmth
of
the
hearth
but
it
was
of
no
avail
patrasche
refused
to
be
comforted
or
to
stir
from
the
barred
portal
it
was
six
when
from
an
opposite
entrance
the
miller
at
last
came
jaded
and
broken
into
his
wife
presence
it
is
lost
forever
he
said
with
an
ashen
cheek
and
a
quiver
in
his
stern
voice
we
have
looked
with
lanterns
everywhere
it
is
gone
the
little
maiden
portion
and
all
his
wife
put
the
money
into
his
hand
and
told
him
how
it
had
come
to
her
the
strong
man
sank
trembling
into
a
seat
and
covered
his
face
ashamed
and
almost
afraid
i
have
been
cruel
to
the
lad
he
muttered
at
length
i
deserved
not
to
have
good
at
his
hands
little
alois
taking
courage
crept
close
to
her
father
and
nestled
against
him
her
fair
curly
head
nello
may
come
here
again
father
she
whispered
he
may
come
as
he
used
to
do
the
miller
pressed
her
in
his
arms
his
hard
sunburned
face
was
very
pale
and
his
mouth
trembled
surely
surely
he
answered
his
child
he
shall
bide
here
on
christmas
day
and
any
other
day
he
will
god
helping
me
i
will
make
amends
to
the
boy
i
will
make
amends
little
alois
kissed
him
in
gratitude
and
joy
then
slid
from
his
knees
and
ran
to
where
the
dog
kept
watch
by
the
door
and
i
may
feast
patrasche
she
cried
in
a
child
thoughtless
glee
her
father
bent
his
head
gravely
ay
ay

the
dog
have
the
best

the
stern
old
man

moved
and
shaken
to
his
heart
depths
it
was
christmas
eve
and
the
was
filled
with
oak
logs
and
squares
of
turf
with
cream
and
honey
with
meat
and
bread
and
the
rafters
were
hung
with
wreaths
of
evergreen
and
the
calvary
and
the
cuckoo
clock
looked
out
from
a
mass
of
holly
there
were
little
paper
lanterns
too
for
alois
and
toys
of
various
fashions
and
sweetmeats
in
papers
there
were
light
and
warmth
and
abundance
everywhere
and
the
child
would
fain
have
made
the
dog
a
guest
honored
and
feasted
but
patrasche
would
neither
lie
in
the
warmth
nor
share
in
the
cheer
famished
he
was
and
very
cold
but
without
nello
he
would
partake
neither
of
comfort
nor
food
against
all
temptation
he
was
proof
and
close
against
the
door
he
leaned
always
watching
only
for
a
means
of
escape
he
wants
the
lad
said
baas
cogez

dog
good
dog
i
will
go
over
to
the
lad
the
first
thing
at
for
no
one
but
patrasche
knew
that
nello
had
left
the
hut
and
no
one
but
patrasche
divined
that
nello
had
gone
to
face
starvation
and
misery
alone
the
was
very
warm
great
logs
crackled
and
flamed
on
the
hearth
neighbors
came
in
for
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
slice
of
the
fat
goose
baking
for
supper

and
sure
of

in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
smiled
on

through

eyes
and
spoke
of
the
way
in
which
he
would
befriend
her
favorite
companion
the
sat
with

contented
face
at
the
the
cuckoo
in
the
clock

mirthful
hours
amidst
it
all
patrasche
was
bidden
with
a
thousand
words
of
welcome
to
tarry
there
a
cherished
guest
but
neither
peace
nor
plenty
could
allure
him
where
nello
was
not
when
the
supper
smoked
on
the
board
and
the
voices
were
loudest
and
gladdest
and
the
brought
choicest
gifts
to
alois
patrasche
watching
always
an
occasion
glided
out
when
the
door
was
unlatched
by
a
careless
and
as
swiftly
as
his
weak
and
tired
limbs
would
bear
him
sped
over
the
snow
in
the
bitter
black
night
he
had
only
one
thought
to
follow
nello
a
human
friend
might
have
paused
for
the
pleasant
meal
the
cheery
warmth
the
cosey
slumber
but
that
was
not
the
friendship
of
patrasche
he
remembered
a
bygone
time
when
an
old
man
and
a
little
child
had
found
him
sick
unto
death
in
the
wayside
ditch
snow
had
fallen
freshly
all
the
evening
long
it
was
now
nearly
ten
the
trail
of
the
boy
footsteps
was
almost
obliterated
it
took
patrasche
long
to
discover
any
scent
when
at
last
he
found
it
it
was
lost
again
quickly
and
lost
and
recovered
and
again
lost
and
again
recovered
a
hundred
times
or
more
the
night
was
very
wild
the
lamps
under
the
wayside
crosses
were
blown
out
the
roads
were
sheets
of
ice
the
impenetrable
darkness
hid
every
trace
of
habitations
there
was
no
living
thing
abroad
all
the
cattle
were
housed
and
in
all
the
huts
and
homesteads
men
and
women
rejoiced
and
feasted
there
was
only
patrasche
out
in
the
cruel
cold
old
and
famished
and
full
of
pain
but
with
the
strength
and
the
patience
of
a
great
love
to
sustain
him
in
his
search
the
trail
of
nello
steps
faint
and
obscure
as
it
was
under
the
new
snow
went
straightly
along
the
accustomed
tracks
into
antwerp
it
was
past
midnight
when
patrasche
traced
it
over
the
boundaries
of
the
town
and
into
the
narrow
tortuous
gloomy
streets
it
was
all
quite
dark
in
the
town
save
where
some
light
gleamed
ruddily
through
the
crevices
of
or
some
group
went
homeward
with
lanterns
chanting
the
streets
were
all
white
with
ice
the
high
walls
and
roofs
loomed
black
against
them
there
was
scarce
a
sound
save
the
riot
of
the
winds
down
the
passages
as
they
tossed
the
creaking
signs
and
shook
the
tall
illustration
the
portals
of
the
cathedral
were
unclosed
after
the
midnight
mass
so
many
had
trodden
through
and
through
the
snow
so
many
diverse
paths
had
crossed
and
recrossed
each
other
that
the
dog
had
a
hard
task
to
retain
any
hold
on
the
track
he
followed
but
he
kept
on
his
way
though
the
cold
pierced
him
to
the
bone
and
the
jagged
ice
cut
his
feet
and
the
hunger
in
his
body
gnawed
like
a
rat
teeth
he
kept
on
his
way
a
poor
gaunt
shivering
thing
and
by
long
patience
traced
the
steps
he
loved
into
the
very
heart
of
the
burgh
and
up
to
the
steps
of
the
great
cathedral
he
is
gone
to
the
things
that
he
loved
thought
patrasche
he
could
not
understand
but
he
was
full
of
sorrow
and
of
pity
for
the
that
to
him
was
so
incomprehensible
and
yet
so
sacred
the
portals
of
the
cathedral
were
unclosed
after
the
midnight
mass
some
heedlessness
in
the
custodians
too
eager
to
go
home
and
feast
or
sleep
or
too
drowsy
to
know
whether
they
turned
the
keys
aright
had
left
one
of
the
doors
unlocked
by
that
accident
the
patrasche
sought
had
passed
through
into
the
building
leaving
the
white
marks
of
snow
upon
the
dark
stone
floor
by
that
slender
white
thread
frozen
as
it
fell
he
was
guided
through
the
intense
silence
through
the
immensity
of
the
vaulted
space
guided
straight
to
the
gates
of
the
chancel
and
stretched
there
upon
the
stones
he
found
nello
he
crept
up
and
touched
the
face
of
the
boy
didst
thou
dream
that
i
should
be
faithless
and
forsake
thee
i
a
dog
said
that
mute
caress
the
lad
raised
himself
with
a
low
cry
and
clasped
him
close
let
us
lie
down
and
die
together
he
murmured
men
have
no
need
of
us
and
we
are
all
alone
in
answer
patrasche
crept
closer
yet
and
laid
his
head
upon
the
young
boy
breast
the
great
tears
stood
in
his
brown
sad
eyes
not
for
himself
for
himself
he
was
happy
they
lay
close
together
in
the
piercing
cold
the
blasts
that
blew
over
the
flemish
dikes
from
the
northern
seas
were
like
waves
of
ice
which
froze
every
living
thing
they
touched
the
interior
of
the
immense
vault
of
stone
in
which
they
were
was
even
more
bitterly
chill
than
the
plains
without
now
and
then
a
bat
moved
in
the
shadows
now
and
then
a
gleam
of
light
came
on
the
ranks
of
carven
figures
under
the
rubens
they
lay
together
quite
still
and
soothed
almost
into
a
dreaming
slumber
by
the
numbing
narcotic
of
the
cold
together
they
dreamed
of
the
old
glad
days
when
they
had
chased
each
other
through
the
flowering
grasses
of
the
summer
meadows
or
sat
hidden
in
the
tall
bulrushes
by
the
water
side
watching
the
boats
go
seaward
in
the
sun
suddenly
through
the
darkness
a
great
white
radiance
streamed
through
the
vastness
of
the
aisles
the
moon
that
was
at
her
height
had
broken
through
the
clouds
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
the
light
reflected
from
the
snow
without
was
clear
as
the
light
of
dawn
it
fell
through
the
arches
full
upon
the
two
pictures
above
from
which
the
boy
on
his
entrance
had
flung
back
the
veil
the
elevation
and
the
descent
of
the
cross
were
for
one
instant
visible
nello
rose
to
his
feet
and
stretched
his
arms
to
them
the
tears
of
a
passionate
ecstasy
glistened
on
the
paleness
of
his
face
i
have
seen
them
at
last
he
cried
aloud
o
god
it
is
enough
his
limbs
failed
under
him
and
he
sank
upon
his
knees
still
gazing
upward
at
the
majesty
that
he
adored
for
a
few
brief
moments
the
light
illumined
the
divine
visions
that
had
been
denied
to
him
so
long
light
clear
and
sweet
and
strong
as
though
it
streamed
from
the
throne
of
heaven
then
suddenly
it
passed
away
once
more
a
great
darkness
covered
the
face
of
christ
the
arms
of
the
boy
drew
close
again
the
body
of
the
dog
we
shall
see
his
face
he
murmured
and
he
will
not
part
us
i
think
on
the
morrow
by
the
chancel
of
the
cathedral
the
people
of
antwerp
found
them
both
they
were
both
dead
the
cold
of
the
night
had
frozen
into
stillness
alike
the
young
life
and
the
old
when
the
christmas
morning
broke
and
the
priests
came
to
the
temple
they
saw
them
lying
thus
on
the
stones
together
above
the
veils
were
drawn
back
from
the
great
visions
of
rubens
and
the
fresh
rays
of
the
sunrise
touched
the
head
of
the
christ
as
the
day
grew
on
there
came
an
old
man
who
wept
as
women
weep
i
was
cruel
to
the
lad
he
muttered
and
now
i
would
have
made
amends
yea
to
the
half
of
my
substance
and
he
should
have
been
to
me
as
a
son
there
came
also
as
the
day
grew
apace
a
painter
who
had
fame
in
the
world
and
who
was
liberal
of
hand
and
of
spirit
i
seek
one
who
should
have
had
the
prize
yesterday
had
worth
won
he
said
to
the
people
a
boy
of
rare
promise
and
genius
an
old
on
a
fallen
tree
at
eventide
that
was
all
his
theme
but
there
was
greatness
for
the
future
in
it
i
would
fain
find
him
and
take
him
with
me
and
teach
him
art
and
a
little
child
with
curling
fair
hair
sobbing
bitterly
as
she
clung
to
her
father
arm
cried
aloud
oh
nello
come
we
have
all
ready
for
thee
the
hands
are
full
of
gifts
and
the
old
piper
will
play
for
us
and
the
mother
says
thou
shalt
stay
by
the
hearth
and
burn
nuts
with
us
all
the
noël
week
long
yes
even
to
the
feast
of
the
kings
and
patrasche
will
be
so
happy
oh
nello
wake
and
come
but
the
young
pale
face
turned
upward
to
the
light
of
the
great
rubens
with
a
smile
upon
its
mouth
answered
them
all
it
is
too
late
for
the
sweet
sonorous
bells
went
ringing
through
the
frost
and
the
sunlight
shone
upon
the
plains
of
snow
and
the
populace
trooped
gay
and
glad
through
the
streets
but
nello
and
patrasche
no
more
asked
charity
at
their
hands
all
they
needed
now
antwerp
gave
unbidden
death
had
been
more
pitiful
to
them
than
longer
life
would
have
been
it
had
taken
the
one
in
the
loyalty
of
love
and
the
other
in
the
innocence
of
faith
from
a
world
which
for
love
has
no
recompense
and
for
faith
no
fulfilment
all
their
lives
they
had
been
together
and
in
their
deaths
they
were
not
divided
for
when
they
were
found
the
arms
of
the
boy
were
folded
too
closely
around
the
dog
to
be
severed
without
violence
and
the
people
of
their
little
village
contrite
and
ashamed
implored
a
special
grace
for
them
and
making
them
one
grave
laid
them
to
rest
there
side
by
side
forever
