by

son
of
the
old
overman

he
is
requested
to
keep
this
invitation
such
was
the
letter
which
james
starr
received
by
the
first
post
on
the
december
the
letter
bearing
the
aberfoyle
postmark
county
of
stirling
scotland
the
engineer
s
curiosity
was
excited
to
the
highest
pitch
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
whether
this
letter
might
not
be
a
hoax
for
many
years
he
had
known
simon
ford
one
of
the
former
foremen
of
the
aberfoyle
mines
of
which
he
james
starr
had
for
twenty
years
been
the
manager
or
as
he
would
be
termed
in
english
the
viewer
james
starr
was
a
man
on
whom
his
years
weighed
no
more
heavily
than
if
they
had
been
forty
he
belonged
to
an
old
edinburgh
family
and
was
one
of
its
most
distinguished
members
his
labors
did
credit
to
the
body
of
engineers
who
are
gradually
devouring
the
carboniferous
subsoil
of
the
united
kingdom
as
much
at
cardiff
and
newcastle
as
in
the
southern
counties
of
scotland
however
it
was
more
particularly
in
the
depths
of
the
mysterious
mines
of
aberfoyle
which
border
on
the
alloa
mines
and
occupy
part
of
the
county
of
stirling
that
the
name
of
starr
had
acquired
the
greatest
renown
there
the
greater
part
of
his
existence
had
been
passed
besides
this
james
starr
belonged
to
the
scottish
antiquarian
society
of
which
he
had
been
made
president
he
was
also
included
amongst
the
most
active
members
of
the
royal
institution
and
the
edinburgh
review
frequently
published
clever
articles
signed
by
him
he
was
in
fact
one
of
those
practical
men
to
whom
is
due
the
prosperity
of
england
he
held
a
high
rank
in
the
old
capital
of
scotland
which
not
only
from
a
physical
but
also
from
a
moral
point
of
view
well
deserves
the
name
of
the
northern
athens
we
know
that
the
english
have
given
to
their
vast
extent
of
a
very
significant
name
they
very
justly
call
them
the
black
indies
and
these
indies
have
contributed
perhaps
even
more
than
the
eastern
indies
to
swell
the
surprising
wealth
of
the
united
kingdom
at
this
period
the
limit
of
time
assigned
by
professional
men
for
the
exhaustion
of
was
far
distant
and
there
was
no
dread
of
scarcity
there
were
still
extensive
mines
to
be
worked
in
the
two
americas
the
manufactories
appropriated
to
so
many
different
uses
locomotives
steamers
gas
works
were
not
likely
to
fail
for
want
of
the
mineral
fuel
but
the
consumption
had
so
increased
during
the
last
few
years
that
certain
beds
had
been
exhausted
even
to
their
smallest
veins
now
deserted
these
mines
perforated
the
ground
with
their
useless
shafts
and
forsaken
galleries
this
was
exactly
the
case
with
the
pits
of
aberfoyle
ten
years
before
the
last
butty
had
raised
the
last
ton
of
coal
from
this
colliery
the
underground
working
stock
traction
engines
trucks
which
run
on
rails
along
the
galleries
subterranean
tramways
frames
to
support
the
shaft
pipes
in
short
all
that
constituted
the
machinery
of
a
mine
had
been
brought
up
from
its
depths
the
exhausted
mine
was
like
the
body
of
a
huge
mastodon
from
which
all
the
organs
of
life
have
been
taken
and
only
the
skeleton
remains
nothing
was
left
but
long
wooden
ladders
down
the
yarrow
shaft
the
only
one
which
now
gave
access
to
the
lower
galleries
of
the
dochart
pit
above
ground
the
sheds
formerly
sheltering
the
outside
works
still
marked
the
spot
where
the
shaft
of
that
pit
had
been
sunk
it
being
now
abandoned
as
were
the
other
pits
of
which
the
whole
constituted
the
mines
of
aberfoyle
it
was
a
sad
day
when
for
the
last
time
the
workmen
quitted
the
mine
in
which
they
had
lived
for
so
many
years
the
engineer
james
starr
had
collected
the
hundreds
of
workmen
which
composed
the
active
and
courageous
population
of
the
mine
overmen
brakemen
putters
wastemen
barrowmen
masons
smiths
carpenters
outside
and
inside
laborers
women
children
and
old
men
all
were
collected
in
the
great
yard
of
the
dochart
pit
formerly
heaped
with
coal
from
the
mine
many
of
these
families
had
existed
for
generations
in
the
mine
of
old
aberfoyle
they
were
now
driven
to
seek
the
means
of
subsistence
elsewhere
and
they
waited
sadly
to
bid
farewell
to
the
engineer
james
starr
stood
upright
at
the
door
of
the
vast
shed
in
which
he
had
for
so
many
years
superintended
the
powerful
machines
of
the
shaft
simon
ford
the
foreman
of
the
dochart
pit
then
years
of
age
and
other
managers
and
overseers
surrounded
him
james
starr
took
off
his
hat
the
miners
cap
in
hand
kept
a
profound
silence
this
farewell
scene
was
of
a
touching
character
not
wanting
in
grandeur
my
friends
said
the
engineer
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
separate
the
aberfoyle
mines
which
for
so
many
years
have
united
us
in
a
common
work
are
now
exhausted
all
our
researches
have
not
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
new
vein
and
the
last
block
of
coal
has
just
been
extracted
from
the
dochart
and
in
confirmation
of
his
words
james
starr
pointed
to
a
lump
of
coal
which
had
been
kept
at
the
bottom
of
a
basket
this
piece
of
coal
my
friends
resumed
james
starr
is
like
the
last
drop
of
blood
which
has
flowed
through
the
veins
of
the
mine
we
shall
keep
it
as
the
first
fragment
of
coal
is
kept
which
was
extracted
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
from
the
bearings
of
aberfoyle
between
these
two
pieces
how
many
generations
of
workmen
have
succeeded
each
other
in
our
pits
now
it
is
over
the
last
words
which
your
engineer
will
address
to
you
are
a
farewell
you
have
lived
in
this
mine
which
your
hands
have
emptied
the
work
has
been
hard
but
not
without
profit
for
you
our
great
family
must
disperse
and
it
is
not
probable
that
the
future
will
ever
again
unite
the
scattered
members
but
do
not
forget
that
we
have
lived
together
for
a
long
time
and
that
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
miners
of
aberfoyle
to
help
each
other
your
old
masters
will
not
forget
you
either
when
men
have
worked
together
they
must
never
be
stranger
to
each
other
again
we
shall
keep
our
eye
on
you
and
wherever
you
go
our
recommendations
shall
follow
you
farewell
then
my
friends
and
may
heaven
be
with
you
so
saying
james
starr
wrung
the
horny
hand
of
the
oldest
miner
whose
eyes
were
dim
with
tears
then
the
overmen
of
the
different
pits
came
forward
to
shake
hands
with
him
whilst
the
miners
waved
their
caps
shouting
farewell
james
starr
our
master
and
our
friend
this
farewell
would
leave
a
lasting
remembrance
in
all
these
honest
hearts
slowly
and
sadly
the
population
quitted
the
yard
the
black
soil
of
the
roads
leading
to
the
dochart
pit
resounded
for
the
last
time
to
the
tread
of
miners
feet
and
silence
succeeded
to
the
bustling
life
which
had
till
then
filled
the
aberfoyle
mines
one
man
alone
remained
by
james
starr
this
was
the
overman
simon
ford
near
him
stood
a
boy
about
fifteen
years
of
age
who
for
some
years
already
had
been
employed
down
below
james
starr
and
simon
ford
knew
and
esteemed
each
other
well
simon
said
the
engineer
starr
replied
the
overman
let
me
add
till
we
meet
again
yes
till
we
meet
again
ford
answered
james
starr
you
know
that
i
shall
be
always
glad
to
see
you
and
talk
over
old
i
know
that
my
house
in
edinburgh
is
always
open
to
it
s
a
long
way
off
is
edinburgh
answered
the
man
shaking
his
head
ay
a
long
way
from
the
dochart
a
long
way
simon
where
do
you
mean
to
live
even
here
starr
we
re
not
going
to
leave
the
mine
our
good
old
nurse
just
because
her
milk
is
dried
up
my
wife
my
boy
and
myself
we
mean
to
remain
faithful
to
her
then
simon
replied
the
engineer
whose
voice
in
spite
of
himself
betrayed
some
emotion
no
i
tell
you
it
s
till
we
meet
again
starr
and
not
just
returned
the
foreman
mark
my
words
aberfoyle
will
see
you
again
the
engineer
did
not
try
to
dispel
the
man
s
illusion
he
patted
harry
s
head
again
wrung
the
father
s
hand
and
left
the
mine
all
this
had
taken
place
ten
years
ago
but
notwithstanding
the
wish
which
the
overman
had
expressed
to
see
him
again
during
that
time
starr
had
heard
nothing
of
him
it
was
after
ten
years
of
separation
that
he
got
this
letter
from
simon
ford
requesting
him
to
take
without
delay
the
road
to
the
old
aberfoyle
colliery
a
communication
of
an
interesting
nature
what
could
it
be
dochart
pit
yarrow
shaft
what
recollections
of
the
past
these
names
brought
back
to
him
yes
that
was
a
fine
time
that
of
work
of
struggle
the
best
part
of
the
engineer
s
life
starr
his
letter
he
pondered
over
it
in
all
its
bearings
he
much
regretted
that
just
a
line
more
had
not
been
added
by
ford
he
wished
he
had
not
been
quite
so
laconic
was
it
possible
that
the
old
foreman
had
discovered
some
new
vein
no
starr
remembered
with
what
minute
care
the
mines
had
been
explored
before
the
definite
cessation
of
the
works
he
had
himself
proceeded
to
the
lowest
soundings
without
finding
the
least
trace
in
the
soil
burrowed
in
every
direction
they
had
even
attempted
to
find
coal
under
strata
which
are
usually
below
it
such
as
the
devonian
red
sandstone
but
without
result
james
starr
had
therefore
abandoned
the
mine
with
the
absolute
conviction
that
it
did
not
contain
another
bit
of
coal
no
he
repeated
no
how
is
it
possible
that
anything
which
could
have
escaped
my
researches
should
be
revealed
to
those
of
simon
ford
however
the
old
overman
must
well
know
that
such
a
discovery
would
be
the
one
thing
in
the
world
to
interest
me
and
this
invitation
which
i
must
keep
secret
to
repair
to
the
dochart
pit
james
starr
always
came
back
to
that
on
the
other
hand
the
engineer
knew
ford
to
be
a
clever
miner
peculiarly
endowed
with
the
instinct
of
his
trade
he
had
not
seen
him
since
the
time
when
the
aberfoyle
colliery
was
abandoned
and
did
not
know
either
what
he
was
doing
or
where
he
was
living
with
his
wife
and
his
son
all
that
he
now
knew
was
that
a
rendezvous
had
been
appointed
him
at
the
yarrow
shaft
and
that
harry
simon
ford
s
son
was
to
wait
for
him
during
the
whole
of
the
next
day
at
the
callander
station
i
shall
go
i
shall
go
said
starr
his
excitement
increasing
as
the
time
drew
near
our
worthy
engineer
belonged
to
that
class
of
men
whose
brain
is
always
on
the
boil
like
a
kettle
on
a
hot
fire
in
some
of
these
brain
kettles
the
ideas
bubble
over
in
others
they
just
simmer
quietly
now
on
this
day
james
starr
s
ideas
were
boiling
fast
but
suddenly
an
unexpected
incident
occurred
this
was
the
drop
of
cold
water
which
in
a
moment
was
to
condense
all
the
vapors
of
the
brain
about
six
in
the
evening
by
the
third
post
starr
s
servant
brought
him
a
second
letter
this
letter
was
enclosed
in
a
coarse
envelope
and
evidently
directed
by
a
hand
unaccustomed
to
the
use
of
a
pen
james
starr
tore
it
open
it
contained
only
a
scrap
of
paper
yellowed
by
time
and
apparently
torn
out
of
an
old
copy
book
on
this
paper
was
written
a
single
sentence
thus
worded
it
is
useless
for
the
engineer
james
starr
to
trouble
himself
simon
ford
s
letter
being
now
without
no
signature
chapter
ii
on
the
road
the
course
of
james
starr
s
ideas
was
abruptly
stopped
when
he
got
this
second
letter
contradicting
the
first
what
does
this
mean
said
he
to
himself
he
took
up
the
torn
envelope
and
examined
it
like
the
other
it
bore
the
aberfoyle
postmark
it
had
therefore
come
from
the
same
part
of
the
county
of
stirling
the
old
miner
had
evidently
not
written
it
but
no
less
evidently
the
author
of
this
second
letter
knew
the
overman
s
secret
since
it
expressly
contradicted
the
invitation
to
the
engineer
to
go
to
the
yarrow
shaft
was
it
really
true
that
the
first
communication
was
now
without
object
did
someone
wish
to
prevent
james
starr
from
troubling
himself
either
uselessly
or
otherwise
might
there
not
be
rather
a
malevolent
intention
to
thwart
ford
s
plans
this
was
the
conclusion
at
which
james
starr
arrived
after
mature
reflection
the
contradiction
which
existed
between
the
two
letters
only
wrought
in
him
a
more
keen
desire
to
visit
the
dochart
pit
and
besides
if
after
all
it
was
a
hoax
it
was
well
worth
while
to
prove
it
starr
also
thought
it
wiser
to
give
more
credence
to
the
first
letter
than
to
the
second
that
is
to
say
to
the
request
of
such
a
man
as
simon
ford
rather
than
to
the
warning
of
his
anonymous
contradictor
indeed
said
he
the
fact
of
anyone
endeavoring
to
influence
my
resolution
shows
that
ford
s
communication
must
be
of
great
importance
at
the
appointed
time
i
shall
be
at
the
in
the
evening
starr
made
his
preparations
for
departure
as
it
might
happen
that
his
absence
would
be
prolonged
for
some
days
he
wrote
to
sir
elphiston
president
of
the
royal
institution
that
he
should
be
unable
to
be
present
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
society
he
also
wrote
to
excuse
himself
from
two
or
three
engagements
which
he
had
made
for
the
week
then
having
ordered
his
servant
to
pack
a
traveling
bag
he
went
to
bed
more
excited
than
the
affair
perhaps
warranted
the
next
day
at
five
o
clock
james
starr
jumped
out
of
bed
dressed
himself
warmly
for
a
cold
rain
was
falling
and
left
his
house
in
the
canongate
to
go
to
granton
pier
to
catch
the
steamer
which
in
three
hours
would
take
him
up
the
forth
as
far
as
stirling
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
perhaps
in
passing
along
the
canongate
he
did
not
turn
to
look
at
holyrood
the
palace
of
the
former
sovereigns
of
scotland
he
did
not
notice
the
sentinels
who
stood
before
its
gateways
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
their
highland
regiment
tartan
kilt
plaid
and
sporran
complete
his
whole
thought
was
to
reach
callander
where
harry
ford
was
supposedly
awaiting
him
the
better
to
understand
this
narrative
it
will
be
as
well
to
hear
a
few
words
on
the
origin
of
coal
during
the
geological
epoch
when
the
terrestrial
spheroid
was
still
in
course
of
formation
a
thick
atmosphere
surrounded
it
saturated
with
watery
vapors
and
copiously
impregnated
with
carbonic
acid
the
vapors
gradually
condensed
in
diluvial
rains
which
fell
as
if
they
had
leapt
from
the
necks
of
thousands
of
millions
of
seltzer
water
bottles
this
liquid
loaded
with
carbonic
acid
rushed
in
torrents
over
a
deep
soft
soil
subject
to
sudden
or
slow
alterations
of
form
and
maintained
in
its
state
as
much
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
as
by
the
fires
of
the
interior
mass
the
internal
heat
had
not
as
yet
been
collected
in
the
center
of
the
globe
the
terrestrial
crust
thin
and
incompletely
hardened
allowed
it
to
spread
through
its
pores
this
caused
a
peculiar
form
of
vegetation
such
as
is
probably
produced
on
the
surface
of
the
inferior
planets
venus
or
mercury
which
revolve
nearer
than
our
earth
around
the
radiant
sun
of
our
system
the
soil
of
the
continents
was
covered
with
immense
forests
carbonic
acid
so
suitable
for
the
development
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
abounded
the
feet
of
these
trees
were
drowned
in
a
sort
of
immense
lagoon
kept
continually
full
by
currents
of
fresh
and
salt
waters
they
eagerly
assimilated
to
themselves
the
carbon
which
they
little
by
little
extracted
from
the
atmosphere
as
yet
unfit
for
the
function
of
life
and
it
may
be
said
that
they
were
destined
to
store
it
in
the
form
of
coal
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
it
was
the
earthquake
period
caused
by
internal
convulsions
which
suddenly
modified
the
unsettled
features
of
the
terrestrial
surface
here
an
intumescence
which
was
to
become
a
mountain
there
an
abyss
which
was
to
be
filled
with
an
ocean
or
a
sea
there
whole
forests
sunk
through
the
earth
s
crust
below
the
unfixed
strata
either
until
they
found
a
such
as
the
primitive
bed
of
granitic
rock
or
settling
together
in
a
heap
they
formed
a
solid
mass
as
the
waters
were
contained
in
no
bed
and
were
spread
over
every
part
of
the
globe
they
rushed
where
they
liked
tearing
from
the
rocks
material
with
which
to
compose
schists
sandstones
and
limestones
this
the
roving
waves
bore
over
the
submerged
and
now
peaty
forests
and
deposited
above
them
the
elements
of
rocks
which
were
to
superpose
the
coal
strata
in
course
of
time
periods
of
which
include
millions
of
years
these
earths
hardened
in
layers
and
enclosed
under
a
thick
carapace
of
schist
compact
or
friable
sandstone
gravel
and
stones
the
whole
of
the
massive
forests
and
what
went
on
in
this
gigantic
crucible
where
all
this
vegetable
matter
had
accumulated
sunk
to
various
depths
a
regular
chemical
operation
a
sort
of
distillation
all
the
carbon
contained
in
these
vegetables
had
agglomerated
and
little
by
little
coal
was
forming
under
the
double
influence
of
enormous
pressure
and
the
high
temperature
maintained
by
the
internal
fires
at
this
time
so
close
to
it
thus
there
was
one
kingdom
substituted
for
another
in
this
slow
but
irresistible
reaction
the
vegetable
was
transformed
into
a
mineral
plants
which
had
lived
the
vegetative
life
in
all
the
vigor
of
first
creation
became
petrified
some
of
the
substances
enclosed
in
this
vast
herbal
left
their
impression
on
the
other
more
rapidly
mineralized
products
which
pressed
them
as
an
hydraulic
press
of
incalculable
power
would
have
done
thus
also
shells
zoophytes
polypi
spirifores
even
fish
and
lizards
brought
by
the
water
left
on
the
yet
soft
coal
their
exact
likeness
admirably
taken
pressure
seems
to
have
played
a
considerable
part
in
the
formation
of
carboniferous
strata
in
fact
it
is
to
its
degree
of
power
that
are
due
the
different
sorts
of
coal
of
which
industry
makes
use
thus
in
the
lowest
layers
of
the
coal
ground
appears
the
anthracite
which
being
almost
destitute
of
volatile
matter
contains
the
greatest
quantity
of
carbon
in
the
higher
beds
are
found
on
the
contrary
lignite
and
fossil
wood
substances
in
which
the
quantity
of
carbon
is
infinitely
less
between
these
two
beds
according
to
the
degree
of
pressure
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
are
found
veins
of
graphite
and
rich
or
poor
coal
it
may
be
asserted
that
it
is
for
want
of
sufficient
pressure
that
beds
of
peaty
bog
have
not
been
completely
changed
into
coal
so
then
the
origin
of
coal
mines
in
whatever
part
of
the
globe
they
have
been
discovered
is
this
the
absorption
through
the
terrestrial
crust
of
the
great
forests
of
the
geological
period
then
the
mineralization
of
the
vegetables
obtained
in
the
course
of
time
under
the
influence
of
pressure
and
heat
and
under
the
action
of
carbonic
acid
now
at
the
time
when
the
events
related
in
this
story
took
place
some
of
the
most
important
mines
of
the
scottish
coal
beds
had
been
exhausted
by
too
rapid
working
in
the
region
which
extends
between
edinburgh
and
glasgow
for
a
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
lay
the
aberfoyle
colliery
of
which
the
engineer
james
starr
had
so
long
directed
the
works
for
ten
years
these
mines
had
been
abandoned
no
new
seams
had
been
discovered
although
the
soundings
had
been
carried
to
a
depth
of
fifteen
hundred
or
even
of
two
thousand
feet
and
when
james
starr
had
retired
it
was
with
the
full
conviction
that
even
the
smallest
vein
had
been
completely
exhausted
under
these
circumstances
it
was
plain
that
the
discovery
of
a
new
seam
of
coal
would
be
an
important
event
could
simon
ford
s
communication
relate
to
a
fact
of
this
nature
this
question
james
starr
could
not
cease
asking
himself
was
he
called
to
make
conquest
of
another
corner
of
these
rich
treasure
fields
fain
would
he
hope
it
was
so
the
second
letter
had
for
an
instant
checked
his
speculations
on
this
subject
but
now
he
thought
of
that
letter
no
longer
besides
the
son
of
the
old
overman
was
there
waiting
at
the
appointed
rendezvous
the
anonymous
letter
was
therefore
worth
nothing
the
moment
the
engineer
set
foot
on
the
platform
at
the
end
of
his
journey
the
young
man
advanced
towards
him
are
you
harry
ford
asked
the
engineer
quickly
yes
i
should
not
have
known
you
my
lad
of
course
in
ten
years
you
have
become
a
man
i
knew
you
directly
sir
replied
the
young
miner
cap
in
hand
you
have
not
changed
you
look
just
as
you
did
when
you
bade
us
in
the
dochart
pit
i
haven
t
forgotten
that
put
on
your
cap
harry
said
the
engineer
it
s
pouring
and
politeness
needn
t
make
you
catch
shall
we
take
shelter
anywhere
starr
asked
young
ford
no
harry
the
weather
is
settled
it
will
rain
all
day
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
let
us
go
i
am
at
your
orders
replied
harry
tell
me
harry
is
your
father
well
very
well
and
your
mother
she
is
well
was
it
your
father
who
wrote
telling
me
to
come
to
the
yarrow
shaft
no
it
was
then
did
simon
ford
send
me
a
second
letter
to
contradict
the
first
asked
the
engineer
quickly
no
starr
answered
the
young
miner
very
well
said
starr
without
speaking
of
the
anonymous
letter
then
continuing
and
can
you
tell
me
what
you
father
wants
with
me
mr
starr
my
father
wishes
to
tell
you
but
you
know
what
it
is
i
do
well
harry
i
will
not
ask
you
more
but
let
us
get
on
for
i
m
anxious
to
see
simon
ford
where
does
he
live
in
the
what
in
the
dochart
pit
yes
starr
replied
harry
really
has
your
family
never
left
the
old
mine
since
the
cessation
of
the
works
not
a
day
starr
you
know
my
father
it
is
there
he
was
born
it
is
there
he
means
to
die
i
can
understand
that
harry
i
can
understand
that
his
native
mine
he
did
not
like
to
abandon
it
and
are
you
happy
there
yes
starr
replied
the
young
miner
for
we
love
one
another
and
we
have
but
few
well
harry
said
the
engineer
lead
the
and
walking
rapidly
through
the
streets
of
callander
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
left
the
town
behind
them
chapter
iii
the
dochart
pit
harry
ford
was
a
fine
strapping
fellow
of
five
and
twenty
his
grave
looks
his
habitually
passive
expression
had
from
childhood
been
noticed
among
his
comrades
in
the
mine
his
regular
features
his
deep
blue
eyes
his
curly
hair
rather
chestnut
than
fair
the
natural
grace
of
his
person
altogether
made
him
a
fine
specimen
of
a
lowlander
accustomed
from
his
earliest
days
to
the
work
of
the
mine
he
was
strong
and
hardy
as
well
as
brave
and
good
guided
by
his
father
and
impelled
by
his
own
inclinations
he
had
early
begun
his
education
and
at
an
age
when
most
lads
are
little
more
than
apprentices
he
had
managed
to
make
himself
of
some
importance
a
leader
in
fact
among
his
fellows
and
few
are
very
ignorant
in
a
country
which
does
all
it
can
to
remove
ignorance
though
during
the
first
years
of
his
youth
the
pick
was
never
out
of
harry
s
hand
nevertheless
the
young
miner
was
not
long
in
acquiring
sufficient
knowledge
to
raise
him
into
the
upper
class
of
the
miners
and
he
would
certainly
have
succeeded
his
father
as
overman
of
the
dochart
pit
if
the
colliery
had
not
been
abandoned
james
starr
was
still
a
good
walker
yet
he
could
not
easily
have
kept
up
with
his
guide
if
the
latter
had
not
slackened
his
pace
the
young
man
carrying
the
engineer
s
bag
followed
the
left
bank
of
the
river
for
about
a
mile
leaving
its
winding
course
they
took
a
road
under
tall
dripping
trees
wide
fields
lay
on
either
side
around
isolated
farms
in
one
field
a
herd
of
hornless
cows
were
quietly
grazing
in
another
sheep
with
silky
wool
like
those
in
a
child
s
toy
sheep
fold
the
yarrow
shaft
was
situated
four
miles
from
callander
whilst
walking
james
starr
could
not
but
be
struck
with
the
change
in
the
country
he
had
not
seen
it
since
the
day
when
the
last
ton
of
aberfoyle
coal
had
been
emptied
into
railway
trucks
to
be
sent
to
glasgow
agricultural
life
had
now
taken
the
place
of
the
more
stirring
active
industrial
life
the
contrast
was
all
the
greater
because
during
winter
field
work
is
at
a
standstill
but
formerly
at
whatever
season
the
mining
population
above
and
below
ground
filled
the
scene
with
animation
great
wagons
of
coal
used
to
be
passing
night
and
day
the
rails
with
their
rotten
sleepers
now
disused
were
then
constantly
ground
by
the
weight
of
wagons
now
stony
roads
took
the
place
of
the
old
mining
tramways
james
starr
felt
as
if
he
was
traversing
a
desert
the
engineer
gazed
about
him
with
a
saddened
eye
he
stopped
now
and
then
to
take
breath
he
listened
the
air
was
no
longer
filled
with
distant
whistlings
and
the
panting
of
engines
none
of
those
black
vapors
which
the
manufacturer
loves
to
see
hung
in
the
horizon
mingling
with
the
clouds
no
tall
cylindrical
or
prismatic
chimney
vomited
out
smoke
after
being
fed
from
the
mine
itself
no
was
puffing
out
its
white
vapor
the
ground
formerly
black
with
coal
dust
had
a
bright
look
to
which
james
starr
s
eyes
were
not
accustomed
when
the
engineer
stood
still
harry
ford
stopped
also
the
young
miner
waited
in
silence
he
felt
what
was
passing
in
his
companion
s
mind
and
he
shared
his
feelings
he
a
child
of
the
mine
whose
whole
life
had
been
passed
in
its
depths
yes
harry
it
is
all
changed
said
starr
but
at
the
rate
we
worked
of
course
the
treasures
of
coal
would
have
been
exhausted
some
day
do
you
regret
that
time
i
do
regret
it
starr
answered
harry
the
work
was
hard
but
it
was
interesting
as
are
all
no
doubt
my
lad
a
continuous
struggle
against
the
dangers
of
landslips
fires
inundations
explosions
of
firedamp
like
claps
of
thunder
one
had
to
guard
against
all
those
perils
you
say
well
it
was
a
struggle
and
consequently
an
exciting
the
miners
of
alva
have
been
more
favored
than
the
miners
of
aberfoyle
starr
ay
harry
so
they
have
replied
the
engineer
indeed
cried
the
young
man
it
s
a
pity
that
all
the
globe
was
not
made
of
coal
then
there
would
have
been
enough
to
last
millions
of
years
no
doubt
there
would
harry
it
must
be
acknowledged
however
that
nature
has
shown
more
forethought
by
forming
our
sphere
principally
of
sandstone
limestone
and
granite
which
fire
can
not
do
you
mean
to
say
starr
that
mankind
would
have
ended
by
burning
their
own
globe
yes
the
whole
of
it
my
lad
answered
the
engineer
the
earth
would
have
passed
to
the
last
bit
into
the
furnaces
of
engines
machines
steamers
gas
factories
certainly
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
our
world
one
fine
day
there
is
no
fear
of
that
now
starr
but
yet
the
mines
will
be
exhausted
no
doubt
and
more
rapidly
than
the
statistics
make
out
that
will
happen
harry
and
in
my
opinion
england
is
very
wrong
in
exchanging
her
fuel
for
the
gold
of
other
nations
i
know
well
added
the
engineer
that
neither
hydraulics
nor
electricity
has
yet
shown
all
they
can
do
and
that
some
day
these
two
forces
will
be
more
completely
utilized
but
no
matter
coal
is
of
a
very
practical
use
and
lends
itself
easily
to
the
various
wants
of
industry
unfortunately
man
can
not
produce
it
at
will
though
our
external
forests
grow
incessantly
under
the
influence
of
heat
and
water
our
subterranean
forests
will
not
be
reproduced
and
if
they
were
the
globe
would
never
be
in
the
state
necessary
to
make
them
into
james
starr
and
his
guide
whilst
talking
had
continued
their
walk
at
a
rapid
pace
an
hour
after
leaving
callander
they
reached
the
dochart
pit
the
most
indifferent
person
would
have
been
touched
at
the
appearance
this
deserted
spot
presented
it
was
like
the
skeleton
of
something
that
had
formerly
lived
a
few
wretched
trees
bordered
a
plain
where
the
ground
was
hidden
under
the
black
dust
of
the
mineral
fuel
but
no
cinders
nor
even
fragments
of
coal
were
to
be
seen
all
had
been
carried
away
and
consumed
long
ago
they
walked
into
the
shed
which
covered
the
opening
of
the
yarrow
shaft
whence
ladders
still
gave
access
to
the
lower
galleries
of
the
pit
the
engineer
bent
over
the
opening
formerly
from
this
place
could
be
heard
the
powerful
whistle
of
the
air
inhaled
by
the
ventilators
it
was
now
a
silent
abyss
it
was
like
being
at
the
mouth
of
some
extinct
volcano
when
the
mine
was
being
worked
ingenious
machines
were
used
in
certain
shafts
of
the
aberfoyle
colliery
which
in
this
respect
was
very
well
off
frames
furnished
with
automatic
lifts
working
in
wooden
slides
oscillating
ladders
called
which
by
a
simple
movement
permitted
the
miners
to
descend
without
danger
but
all
these
appliances
had
been
carried
away
after
the
cessation
of
the
works
in
the
yarrow
shaft
there
remained
only
a
long
succession
of
ladders
separated
at
every
fifty
feet
by
narrow
landings
thirty
of
these
ladders
placed
thus
end
to
end
led
the
visitor
down
into
the
lower
gallery
a
depth
of
fifteen
hundred
feet
this
was
the
only
way
of
communication
which
existed
between
the
bottom
of
the
dochart
pit
and
the
open
air
as
to
air
that
came
in
by
the
yarrow
shaft
from
whence
galleries
communicated
with
another
shaft
whose
orifice
opened
at
a
higher
level
the
warm
air
naturally
escaped
by
this
species
of
inverted
siphon
i
will
follow
you
my
lad
said
the
engineer
signing
to
the
young
man
to
precede
him
as
you
please
have
you
your
lamp
yes
and
i
only
wish
it
was
still
the
safety
lamp
which
we
formerly
had
to
use
sure
enough
returned
james
starr
there
is
no
fear
of
explosions
now
harry
was
provided
with
a
simple
oil
lamp
the
wick
of
which
he
lighted
in
the
mine
now
empty
of
coal
escapes
of
light
carburetted
hydrogen
could
not
occur
as
no
explosion
need
be
feared
there
was
no
necessity
for
interposing
between
the
flame
and
the
surrounding
air
that
metallic
screen
which
prevents
the
gas
from
catching
fire
the
davy
lamp
was
of
no
use
here
but
if
the
danger
did
not
exist
it
was
because
the
cause
of
it
had
disappeared
and
with
this
cause
the
combustible
in
which
formerly
consisted
the
riches
of
the
dochart
pit
harry
descended
the
first
steps
of
the
upper
ladder
starr
followed
they
soon
found
themselves
in
a
profound
obscurity
which
was
only
relieved
by
the
glimmer
of
the
lamp
the
young
man
held
it
above
his
head
the
better
to
light
his
companion
a
dozen
ladders
were
descended
by
the
engineer
and
his
guide
with
the
measured
step
habitual
to
the
miner
they
were
all
still
in
good
condition
james
starr
examined
as
well
as
the
insufficient
light
would
permit
the
sides
of
the
dark
shaft
which
were
covered
by
a
partly
rotten
lining
of
wood
arrived
at
the
fifteenth
landing
that
is
to
say
half
way
down
they
halted
for
a
few
minutes
decidedly
i
have
not
your
legs
my
lad
said
the
engineer
panting
you
are
very
stout
starr
replied
harry
and
it
s
something
too
you
see
to
live
all
one
s
life
in
the
right
harry
formerly
when
i
was
twenty
i
could
have
gone
down
all
at
a
breath
come
forward
but
just
as
the
two
were
about
to
leave
the
platform
a
voice
as
yet
far
distant
was
heard
in
the
depths
of
the
shaft
it
came
up
like
a
sonorous
billow
swelling
as
it
advanced
and
becoming
more
and
more
distinct
halloo
who
comes
here
asked
the
engineer
stopping
harry
i
can
not
say
answered
the
young
miner
is
it
not
your
father
my
father
starr
some
neighbor
then
we
have
no
neighbors
in
the
bottom
of
the
pit
replied
harry
we
are
alone
quite
well
we
must
let
this
intruder
pass
said
james
starr
those
who
are
descending
must
yield
the
path
to
those
who
are
they
waited
the
voice
broke
out
again
with
a
magnificent
burst
as
if
it
had
been
carried
through
a
vast
speaking
trumpet
and
soon
a
few
words
of
a
scotch
song
came
clearly
to
the
ears
of
the
young
miner
the
hundred
pipers
cried
harry
well
i
shall
be
much
surprised
if
that
comes
from
the
lungs
of
any
man
but
jack
and
who
is
this
jack
ryan
asked
james
starr
an
old
mining
comrade
replied
harry
then
leaning
from
the
platform
halloo
jack
he
shouted
is
that
you
harry
was
the
reply
wait
a
bit
i
m
and
the
song
broke
forth
again
in
a
few
minutes
a
tall
fellow
of
five
and
twenty
with
a
merry
face
smiling
eyes
a
laughing
mouth
and
sandy
hair
appeared
at
the
bottom
of
the
luminous
cone
which
was
thrown
from
his
lantern
and
set
foot
on
the
landing
of
the
fifteenth
ladder
his
first
act
was
to
vigorously
wring
the
hand
which
harry
extended
to
him
delighted
to
meet
you
he
exclaimed
if
i
had
only
known
you
were
to
be
above
ground
i
would
have
spared
myself
going
down
the
yarrow
shaft
this
is
james
starr
said
harry
turning
his
lamp
towards
the
engineer
who
was
in
the
shadow
mr
starr
cried
jack
ryan
ah
sir
i
could
not
see
since
i
left
the
mine
my
eyes
have
not
been
accustomed
to
see
in
the
dark
as
they
used
to
ah
i
remember
a
laddie
who
was
always
singing
that
was
ten
years
ago
it
was
you
no
doubt
ay
starr
but
in
changing
my
trade
i
haven
t
changed
my
disposition
it
s
far
better
to
laugh
and
sing
than
to
cry
and
whine
you
re
right
there
jack
ryan
and
what
do
you
do
now
as
you
have
left
the
mine
i
am
working
on
the
melrose
farm
forty
miles
from
here
ah
it
s
not
like
our
aberfoyle
mines
the
pick
comes
better
to
my
hand
than
the
spade
or
hoe
and
then
in
the
old
pit
there
were
vaulted
roofs
to
merrily
echo
one
s
songs
while
up
above
ground
but
you
are
going
to
see
old
simon
starr
yes
jack
answered
the
engineer
don
t
let
me
keep
you
tell
me
jack
said
harry
what
was
taking
you
to
our
cottage
i
wanted
to
see
you
man
replied
jack
and
ask
you
to
come
to
the
irvine
games
you
know
i
am
the
piper
of
the
place
there
will
be
dancing
and
thank
you
jack
but
it
s
impossible
yes
starr
s
visit
will
last
some
time
and
i
must
take
him
back
to
well
harry
it
won
t
be
for
a
week
yet
by
that
time
starr
s
visit
will
be
over
i
should
think
and
there
will
be
nothing
to
keep
you
at
the
indeed
harry
said
james
starr
you
must
profit
by
your
friend
jack
s
well
i
accept
it
jack
said
harry
in
a
week
we
will
meet
at
in
a
week
that
s
settled

ryan
harry
your
servant
starr
i
am
very
glad
to
have
seen
you
again
i
can
give
news
of
you
to
all
my
friends
no
one
has
forgotten
you
and
i
have
forgotten
no
one
said
starr
thanks
for
all
sir
replied
jack
jack
said
harry
shaking
his
hand
and
jack
ryan
singing
as
he
went
soon
disappeared
in
the
heights
of
the
shaft
dimly
lighted
by
his
lamp
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
james
starr
and
harry
descended
the
last
ladder
and
set
foot
on
the
lowest
floor
of
the
pit
from
the
bottom
of
the
yarrow
shaft
radiated
numerous
empty
galleries
they
ran
through
the
wall
of
schist
and
sandstone
some
shored
up
with
great
beams
others
lined
with
a
thick
casing
of
wood
in
every
direction
embankments
supplied
the
place
of
the
excavated
veins
artificial
pillars
were
made
of
stone
from
neighboring
quarries
and
now
they
supported
the
ground
that
is
to
say
the
double
layer
of
tertiary
and
quaternary
soil
which
formerly
rested
on
the
seam
itself
darkness
now
filled
the
galleries
formerly
lighted
either
by
the
miner
s
lamp
or
by
the
electric
light
the
use
of
which
had
been
introduced
in
the
mines
will
you
not
rest
a
while
starr
asked
the
young
man
no
my
lad
replied
the
engineer
for
i
am
anxious
to
be
at
your
father
s
follow
me
then
starr
i
will
guide
you
and
yet
i
daresay
you
could
find
your
way
perfectly
well
through
this
dark
yes
indeed
i
have
the
whole
plan
of
the
old
pit
still
in
my
harry
followed
by
the
engineer
and
holding
his
lamp
high
the
better
to
light
their
way
walked
along
a
high
gallery
like
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
their
feet
still
struck
against
the
wooden
sleepers
which
used
to
support
the
rails
they
had
not
gone
more
than
fifty
paces
when
a
huge
stone
fell
at
the
feet
of
james
starr
take
care
starr
cried
harry
seizing
the
engineer
by
the
arm
a
stone
harry
ah
these
old
vaultings
are
no
longer
quite
secure
of
course
and
mr
starr
said
harry
ford
it
seems
to
me
that
stone
was
thrown
thrown
as
by
the
hand
of
man
thrown
exclaimed
james
starr
what
do
you
mean
lad
nothing
nothing
starr
replied
harry
evasively
his
anxious
gaze
endeavoring
to
pierce
the
darkness
let
us
go
on
take
my
arm
sir
and
don
t
be
afraid
of
making
a
false
here
i
am
and
they
both
advanced
whilst
harry
looked
on
every
side
throwing
the
light
of
his
lamp
into
all
the
corners
of
the
gallery
shall
we
soon
be
there
asked
the
engineer
in
ten
minutes
at
but
muttered
harry
that
was
a
most
singular
thing
it
is
the
first
time
such
an
accident
has
happened
to
me
that
stone
falling
just
at
the
moment
we
were
harry
it
was
a
mere
chance
replied
the
young
man
shaking
his
head
yes
he
stopped
and
listened
what
is
the
matter
harry
asked
the
engineer
i
thought
i
heard
someone
walking
behind
us
replied
the
young
miner
listening
more
attentively
then
he
added
no
i
must
have
been
mistaken
lean
harder
on
my
arm
starr
use
me
like
a
a
good
solid
staff
harry
answered
james
starr
i
could
not
wish
for
a
better
than
a
fine
fellow
like
they
continued
in
silence
along
the
dark
nave
harry
was
evidently
preoccupied
and
frequently
turned
trying
to
catch
either
some
distant
noise
or
remote
glimmer
of
light
but
behind
and
before
all
was
silence
and
darkness
chapter
iv
the
ford
family
ten
minutes
afterwards
james
starr
and
harry
issued
from
the
principal
gallery
they
were
now
standing
in
a
glade
if
we
may
use
this
word
to
designate
a
vast
and
dark
excavation
the
place
however
was
not
entirely
deprived
of
daylight
a
few
rays
straggled
in
through
the
opening
of
a
deserted
shaft
it
was
by
means
of
this
pipe
that
ventilation
was
established
in
the
dochart
pit
owing
to
its
lesser
density
the
warm
air
was
drawn
towards
the
yarrow
shaft
both
air
and
light
therefore
penetrated
in
some
measure
into
the
glade
here
simon
ford
had
lived
with
his
family
ten
years
in
a
subterranean
dwelling
hollowed
out
in
the
schistous
mass
where
formerly
stood
the
powerful
engines
which
worked
the
mechanical
traction
of
the
dochart
pit
such
was
the
habitation
his
cottage
as
he
called
it
in
which
resided
the
old
overman
as
he
had
some
means
saved
during
a
long
life
of
toil
ford
could
have
afforded
to
live
in
the
light
of
day
among
trees
or
in
any
town
of
the
kingdom
he
chose
but
he
and
his
wife
and
son
preferred
remaining
in
the
mine
where
they
were
happy
together
having
the
same
opinions
ideas
and
tastes
yes
they
were
quite
fond
of
their
cottage
buried
fifteen
hundred
feet
below
scottish
soil
among
other
advantages
there
was
no
fear
that
tax
gatherers
or
rent
collectors
would
ever
come
to
trouble
its
inhabitants
at
this
period
simon
ford
the
former
overman
of
the
dochart
pit
bore
the
weight
of
years
well
tall
robust
he
would
have
been
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
men
in
the
district
which
supplies
so
many
fine
fellows
to
the
highland
regiments
simon
ford
was
descended
from
an
old
mining
family
and
his
ancestors
had
worked
the
very
first
carboniferous
seams
opened
in
scotland
without
discussing
whether
or
not
the
greeks
and
romans
made
use
of
coal
whether
the
chinese
worked
coal
mines
before
the
christian
era
whether
the
french
word
for
coal
houille
is
really
derived
from
the
farrier
houillos
who
lived
in
belgium
in
the
twelfth
century
we
may
affirm
that
the
beds
in
great
britain
were
the
first
ever
regularly
worked
so
early
as
the
eleventh
century
william
the
conqueror
divided
the
produce
of
the
newcastle
bed
among
his
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
license
for
the
mining
of
sea
coal
was
granted
by
henry
iii
lastly
towards
the
end
of
the
same
century
mention
is
made
of
the
scotch
and
welsh
beds
it
was
about
this
time
that
simon
ford
s
ancestors
penetrated
into
the
bowels
of
caledonian
earth
and
lived
there
ever
after
from
father
to
son
they
were
but
plain
miners
they
labored
like
convicts
at
the
work
of
extracting
the
precious
combustible
it
is
even
believed
that
the
coal
miners
like
the
of
that
period
were
actual
slaves
however
that
might
have
been
simon
ford
was
proud
of
belonging
to
this
ancient
family
of
scotch
miners
he
had
worked
diligently
in
the
same
place
where
his
ancestors
had
wielded
the
pick
the
crowbar
and
the
mattock
at
thirty
he
was
overman
of
the
dochart
pit
the
most
important
in
the
aberfoyle
colliery
he
was
devoted
to
his
trade
during
long
years
he
zealously
performed
his
duty
his
only
grief
had
been
to
perceive
the
bed
becoming
impoverished
and
to
see
the
hour
approaching
when
the
seam
would
be
exhausted
it
was
then
he
devoted
himself
to
the
search
for
new
veins
in
all
the
aberfoyle
pits
which
communicated
underground
one
with
another
he
had
had
the
good
luck
to
discover
several
during
the
last
period
of
the
working
his
miner
s
instinct
assisted
him
marvelously
and
the
engineer
james
starr
appreciated
him
highly
it
might
be
said
that
he
divined
the
course
of
seams
in
the
depths
of
the
coal
mine
as
a
hydroscope
reveals
springs
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
he
was
par
excellence
the
type
of
a
miner
whose
whole
existence
is
indissolubly
connected
with
that
of
his
mine
he
had
lived
there
from
his
birth
and
now
that
the
works
were
abandoned
he
wished
to
live
there
still
his
son
harry
foraged
for
the
subterranean
housekeeping
as
for
himself
during
those
ten
years
he
had
not
been
ten
times
above
ground
go
up
there
what
is
the
good
he
would
say
and
refused
to
leave
his
black
domain
the
place
was
remarkably
healthy
subject
to
an
equable
temperature
the
old
overman
endured
neither
the
heat
of
summer
nor
the
cold
of
winter
his
family
enjoyed
good
health
what
more
could
he
desire
but
at
heart
he
felt
depressed
he
missed
the
former
animation
movement
and
life
in
the
pit
he
was
however
supported
by
one
fixed
idea
no
no
the
mine
is
not
exhausted
he
repeated
and
that
man
would
have
given
serious
offense
who
could
have
ventured
to
express
before
simon
ford
any
doubt
that
old
aberfoyle
would
one
day
revive
he
had
never
given
up
the
hope
of
discovering
some
new
bed
which
would
restore
the
mine
to
its
past
splendor
yes
he
would
willingly
had
it
been
necessary
have
resumed
the
miner
s
pick
and
with
his
still
stout
arms
vigorously
attacked
the
rock
he
went
through
the
dark
galleries
sometimes
alone
sometimes
with
his
son
examining
searching
for
signs
of
coal
only
to
return
each
day
wearied
but
not
in
despair
to
the
cottage
madge
simon
s
faithful
companion
his
to
use
the
scotch
term
was
a
tall
strong
comely
woman
madge
had
no
wish
to
leave
the
dochart
pit
any
more
than
had
her
husband
she
shared
all
his
hopes
and
regrets
she
encouraged
him
she
urged
him
on
and
talked
to
him
in
a
way
which
cheered
the
heart
of
the
old
overman
aberfoyle
is
only
asleep
she
would
say
you
are
right
about
that
simon
this
is
but
a
rest
it
is
not
death
madge
as
well
as
the
others
was
perfectly
satisfied
to
live
independent
of
the
outer
world
and
was
the
center
of
the
happiness
enjoyed
by
the
little
family
in
their
dark
cottage
the
engineer
was
eagerly
expected
simon
ford
was
standing
at
his
door
and
as
soon
as
harry
s
lamp
announced
the
arrival
of
his
former
viewer
he
advanced
to
meet
him
welcome
starr
he
exclaimed
his
voice
echoing
under
the
roof
of
schist
welcome
to
the
old
overman
s
cottage
though
it
is
buried
fifteen
hundred
feet
under
the
earth
our
house
is
not
the
less
and
how
are
you
good
simon
asked
james
starr
grasping
the
hand
which
his
host
held
out
to
him
very
well
starr
how
could
i
be
otherwise
here
sheltered
from
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
your
ladies
who
go
to
newhaven
or
portobello
in
the
summer
time
would
do
much
better
to
pass
a
few
months
in
the
coal
mine
of
aberfoyle
they
would
run
no
risk
here
of
catching
a
heavy
cold
as
they
do
in
the
damp
streets
of
the
old
i
m
not
the
man
to
contradict
you
simon
answered
james
starr
glad
to
find
the
old
man
just
as
he
used
to
be
indeed
i
wonder
why
i
do
not
change
my
home
in
the
canongate
for
a
cottage
near
and
why
not
starr
i
know
one
of
your
old
miners
who
would
be
truly
pleased
to
have
only
a
partition
wall
between
you
and
and
how
is
madge
asked
the
engineer
the
goodwife
is
in
better
health
than
i
am
if
that
s
possible
replied
ford
and
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
her
to
see
you
at
her
table
i
think
she
will
surpass
herself
to
do
you
we
shall
see
that
simon
we
shall
see
that
said
the
engineer
to
whom
the
announcement
of
a
good
breakfast
could
not
be
indifferent
after
his
long
walk
are
you
hungry
starr
ravenously
hungry
my
journey
has
given
me
an
appetite
i
came
through
horrible
ah
it
is
raining
up
there
responded
simon
ford
yes
simon
and
the
waters
of
the
forth
are
as
rough
as
the
well
starr
here
it
never
rains
but
i
needn
t
describe
to
you
all
the
advantages
which
you
know
as
well
as
myself
here
we
are
at
the
cottage
that
is
the
chief
thing
and
i
again
say
you
are
welcome
simon
ford
followed
by
harry
ushered
their
guest
into
the
dwelling
james
starr
found
himself
in
a
large
room
lighted
by
numerous
lamps
one
hanging
from
the
colored
beams
of
the
roof
the
soup
is
ready
wife
said
ford
and
it
mustn
t
be
kept
waiting
any
more
than
starr
he
is
as
hungry
as
a
miner
and
he
shall
see
that
our
boy
doesn
t
let
us
want
for
anything
in
the
cottage
harry
added
the
old
overman
turning
to
his
son
jack
ryan
came
here
to
see
i
know
father
we
met
him
in
the
yarrow
he
s
an
honest
and
a
merry
fellow
said
ford
but
he
seems
to
be
quite
happy
above
ground
he
hasn
t
the
true
miner
s
blood
in
his
veins
sit
down
starr
and
have
a
good
dinner
for
we
may
not
sup
till
as
the
engineer
and
his
hosts
were
taking
their
places
one
moment
simon
said
james
starr
do
you
want
me
to
eat
with
a
good
appetite
it
will
be
doing
us
all
possible
honor
starr
answered
ford
well
in
order
to
eat
heartily
i
must
not
be
at
all
anxious
now
i
have
two
questions
to
put
to
go
on
your
letter
told
me
of
a
communication
which
was
to
be
of
an
interesting
it
is
very
interesting
to
you
to
you
and
to
me
starr
but
i
do
not
want
to
tell
it
you
until
after
dinner
and
on
the
very
spot
itself
without
that
you
would
not
believe
simon
resumed
the
engineer
look
me
straight
in
the
face
an
interesting
communication
yes
good
i
will
not
ask
more
he
added
as
if
he
had
read
the
reply
in
the
old
overman
s
eyes
and
the
second
question
asked
the
latter
do
you
know
simon
who
the
person
is
who
can
have
written
this
answered
the
engineer
handing
him
the
anonymous
letter
ford
took
the
letter
and
read
it
attentively
then
giving
it
to
his
son
do
you
know
the
writing
he
asked
no
father
replied
harry
and
had
this
letter
the
aberfoyle
postmark
inquired
simon
ford
yes
like
yours
replied
james
starr
what
do
you
think
of
that
harry
said
his
father
his
brow
darkening
i
think
father
returned
harry
that
someone
has
had
some
interest
in
trying
to
prevent
starr
from
coming
to
the
place
where
you
invited
but
who
exclaimed
the
old
miner
who
could
have
possibly
guessed
enough
of
my
secret
and
simon
fell
into
a
reverie
from
which
he
was
aroused
by
his
wife
let
us
begin
starr
she
said
the
soup
is
already
getting
cold
don
t
think
any
more
of
that
letter
just
on
the
old
woman
s
invitation
each
drew
in
his
chair
james
starr
opposite
to
madge
to
do
him
honor
the
father
and
son
opposite
to
each
other
it
was
a
good
scotch
dinner
first
they
ate
hotchpotch
soup
with
the
meat
swimming
in
capital
broth
as
old
simon
said
his
wife
knew
no
rival
in
the
art
of
preparing
hotchpotch
it
was
the
same
with
the
cockyleeky
a
cock
stewed
with
leeks
which
merited
high
praise
the
whole
was
washed
down
with
excellent
ale
obtained
from
the
best
brewery
in
edinburgh
but
the
principal
dish
consisted
of
a
haggis
the
national
pudding
made
of
meat
and
barley
meal
this
remarkable
dish
which
inspired
the
poet
burns
with
one
of
his
best
odes
shared
the
fate
of
all
the
good
things
in
this
world
it
passed
away
like
a
dream
madge
received
the
sincere
compliments
of
her
guest
the
dinner
ended
with
cheese
and
oatcake
accompanied
by
a
few
small
glasses
of
usquebaugh
capital
whisky
five
and
twenty
years
old
just
harry
s
age
the
repast
lasted
a
good
hour
james
starr
and
simon
ford
had
not
only
eaten
much
but
talked
much
too
chiefly
of
their
past
life
in
the
old
aberfoyle
mine
harry
had
been
rather
silent
twice
he
had
left
the
table
and
even
the
house
he
evidently
felt
uneasy
since
the
incident
of
the
stone
and
wished
to
examine
the
environs
of
the
cottage
the
anonymous
letter
had
not
contributed
to
reassure
him
whilst
he
was
absent
the
engineer
observed
to
ford
and
his
wife
that
s
a
fine
lad
you
have
there
my
yes
starr
he
is
a
good
and
affectionate
son
replied
the
old
overman
earnestly
is
he
happy
with
you
in
the
cottage
he
would
not
wish
to
leave
don
t
you
think
of
finding
him
a
wife
some
day
a
wife
for
harry
exclaimed
ford
and
who
would
it
be
a
girl
from
up
yonder
who
would
love
and
dancing
who
would
prefer
her
clan
to
our
mine
harry
wouldn
t
do
it
simon
said
madge
you
would
not
forbid
that
harry
should
take
a
i
would
forbid
nothing
returned
the
old
miner
but
there
s
no
hurry
about
that
who
knows
but
we
may
find
one
for
him
harry
at
that
moment
and
simon
ford
was
silent
when
madge
rose
from
the
table
all
followed
her
example
and
seated
themselves
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
well
simon
said
the
engineer
i
am
ready
to
hear
mr
starr
responded
ford
i
do
not
need
your
ears
but
your
legs
are
you
quite
rested
quite
rested
and
quite
refreshed
simon
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
wherever
you
harry
said
simon
ford
turning
to
his
son
light
our
safety
are
you
going
to
take
safety
lamps
exclaimed
james
starr
in
amazement
knowing
that
there
was
no
fear
of
explosions
of
in
a
pit
quite
empty
of
coal
yes
starr
it
will
be
my
good
simon
won
t
you
propose
next
to
put
me
in
a
miner
s
dress
not
just
yet
sir
not
just
yet
returned
the
old
overman
his
eyes
gleaming
strangely
harry
soon
reappeared
carrying
three
safety
lamps
he
handed
one
of
these
to
the
engineer
the
other
to
his
father
and
kept
the
third
hanging
from
his
left
hand
whilst
his
right
was
armed
with
a
long
stick
forward
said
simon
ford
taking
up
a
strong
pick
which
was
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
cottage
forward
echoed
the
engineer
god
speed
you
responded
the
good
woman
a
good
supper
wife
do
you
hear
exclaimed
ford
we
shall
be
hungry
when
we
come
back
and
will
do
it
justice
chapter
some
strange
phenomena
many
superstitious
beliefs
exist
both
in
the
highlands
and
lowlands
of
scotland
of
course
the
mining
population
must
furnish
its
contingent
of
legends
and
fables
to
this
mythological
repertory
if
the
fields
are
peopled
with
imaginary
beings
either
good
or
bad
with
much
more
reason
must
the
dark
mines
be
haunted
to
their
lowest
depths
who
shakes
the
seam
during
tempestuous
nights
who
puts
the
miners
on
the
track
of
an
as
yet
unworked
vein
who
lights
the
and
presides
over
the
terrible
explosions
who
but
some
spirit
of
the
mine
this
at
least
was
the
opinion
commonly
spread
among
the
superstitious
scotch
in
the
first
rank
of
the
believers
in
the
supernatural
in
the
dochart
pit
figured
jack
ryan
harry
s
friend
he
was
the
great
partisan
of
all
these
superstitions
all
these
wild
stories
were
turned
by
him
into
songs
which
earned
him
great
applause
in
the
winter
evenings
but
jack
ryan
was
not
alone
in
his
belief
his
comrades
affirmed
no
less
strongly
that
the
aberfoyle
pits
were
haunted
and
that
certain
strange
beings
were
seen
there
frequently
just
as
in
the
highlands
to
hear
them
talk
it
would
have
been
more
extraordinary
if
nothing
of
the
kind
appeared
could
there
indeed
be
a
better
place
than
a
dark
and
deep
coal
mine
for
the
freaks
of
fairies
elves
goblins
and
other
actors
in
the
fantastical
dramas
the
scenery
was
all
ready
why
should
not
the
supernatural
personages
come
there
to
play
their
parts
so
reasoned
jack
ryan
and
his
comrades
in
the
aberfoyle
mines
we
have
said
that
the
different
pits
communicated
with
each
other
by
means
of
long
subterranean
galleries
thus
there
existed
beneath
the
county
of
stirling
a
vast
tract
full
of
burrows
tunnels
bored
with
caves
and
perforated
with
shafts
a
subterranean
labyrinth
which
might
be
compared
to
an
enormous
miners
though
belonging
to
different
pits
often
met
when
going
to
or
returning
from
their
work
consequently
there
was
a
constant
opportunity
of
exchanging
talk
and
circulating
the
stories
which
had
their
origin
in
the
mine
from
one
pit
to
another
these
accounts
were
transmitted
with
marvelous
rapidity
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
gaining
in
wonder
as
they
went
two
men
however
better
educated
and
with
more
practical
minds
than
the
rest
had
always
resisted
this
temptation
they
in
no
degree
believed
in
the
intervention
of
spirits
elves
or
goblins
these
two
were
simon
ford
and
his
son
and
they
proved
it
by
continuing
to
inhabit
the
dismal
crypt
after
the
desertion
of
the
dochart
pit
perhaps
good
madge
like
every
highland
woman
had
some
leaning
towards
the
supernatural
but
she
had
to
repeat
all
these
stories
to
herself
and
so
she
did
most
conscientiously
so
as
not
to
let
the
old
traditions
be
lost
even
had
simon
and
harry
ford
been
as
credulous
as
their
companions
they
would
not
have
abandoned
the
mine
to
the
imps
and
fairies
for
ten
years
without
missing
a
single
day
obstinate
and
immovable
in
their
convictions
the
father
and
son
took
their
picks
their
sticks
and
their
lamps
they
went
about
searching
sounding
the
rock
with
a
sharp
blow
listening
if
it
would
return
a
sound
so
long
as
the
soundings
had
not
been
pushed
to
the
granite
of
the
primary
formation
the
fords
were
agreed
that
the
search
unsuccessful
might
succeed
and
that
it
ought
to
be
resumed
they
spent
their
whole
life
in
endeavoring
to
bring
aberfoyle
back
to
its
former
prosperity
if
the
father
died
before
the
hour
of
success
the
son
was
to
go
on
with
the
task
alone
it
was
during
these
excursions
that
harry
was
more
particularly
struck
by
certain
phenomena
which
he
vainly
sought
to
explain
several
times
while
walking
along
some
narrow
he
seemed
to
hear
sounds
similar
to
those
which
would
be
produced
by
violent
blows
of
a
pickax
against
the
wall
harry
hastened
to
seek
the
cause
of
this
mysterious
work
the
tunnel
was
empty
the
light
from
the
young
miner
s
lamp
thrown
on
the
wall
revealed
no
trace
of
any
recent
work
with
pick
or
crowbar
harry
would
then
ask
himself
if
it
was
not
the
effect
of
some
acoustic
illusion
or
some
strange
and
fantastic
echo
at
other
times
on
suddenly
throwing
a
bright
light
into
a
cleft
in
the
rock
he
thought
he
saw
a
shadow
he
rushed
forward
nothing
and
there
was
no
opening
to
permit
a
human
being
to
evade
his
pursuit
twice
in
one
month
harry
whilst
visiting
the
west
end
of
the
pit
distinctly
heard
distant
reports
as
if
some
miner
had
exploded
a
charge
of
dynamite
the
second
time
after
many
careful
researches
he
found
that
a
pillar
had
just
been
blown
up
by
the
light
of
his
lamp
harry
carefully
examined
the
place
attacked
by
the
explosion
it
had
not
been
made
in
a
simple
embankment
of
stones
but
in
a
mass
of
schist
which
had
penetrated
to
this
depth
in
the
coal
stratum
had
the
object
of
the
explosion
been
to
discover
a
new
vein
or
had
someone
wished
simply
to
destroy
this
portion
of
the
mine
thus
he
questioned
and
when
he
made
known
this
occurrence
to
his
father
neither
could
the
old
overman
nor
he
himself
answer
the
question
in
a
satisfactory
way
it
is
very
queer
harry
often
repeated
the
presence
of
an
unknown
being
in
the
mine
seems
impossible
and
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
does
someone
besides
ourselves
wish
to
find
out
if
a
seam
yet
exists
or
rather
has
he
attempted
to
destroy
what
remains
of
the
aberfoyle
mines
but
for
what
reason
i
will
find
that
out
if
it
should
cost
me
my
life
a
fortnight
before
the
day
on
which
harry
ford
guided
the
engineer
through
the
labyrinth
of
the
dochart
pit
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
attaining
the
object
of
his
search
he
was
going
over
the
southwest
end
of
the
mine
with
a
large
lantern
in
his
hand
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
light
was
suddenly
extinguished
some
hundred
feet
before
him
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
passage
cut
obliquely
through
the
rock
he
darted
forward
his
search
was
in
vain
as
harry
would
not
admit
a
supernatural
explanation
for
a
physical
occurrence
he
concluded
that
certainly
some
strange
being
prowled
about
in
the
pit
but
whatever
he
could
do
searching
with
the
greatest
care
scrutinizing
every
crevice
in
the
gallery
he
found
nothing
for
his
trouble
if
jack
ryan
and
the
other
superstitious
fellows
in
the
mine
had
seen
these
lights
they
would
without
fail
have
called
them
supernatural
but
harry
did
not
dream
of
doing
so
nor
did
his
father
and
when
they
talked
over
these
phenomena
evidently
due
to
a
physical
cause
my
lad
the
old
man
would
say
we
must
wait
it
will
all
be
explained
some
however
it
must
be
observed
that
hitherto
neither
harry
nor
his
father
had
ever
been
exposed
to
any
act
of
violence
if
the
stone
which
had
fallen
at
the
feet
of
james
starr
had
been
thrown
by
the
hand
of
some
person
it
was
the
first
criminal
act
of
that
description
james
starr
was
of
opinion
that
the
stone
had
become
detached
from
the
roof
of
the
gallery
but
harry
would
not
admit
of
such
a
simple
explanation
according
to
him
the
stone
had
not
fallen
it
had
been
thrown
for
otherwise
without
rebounding
it
could
never
have
described
a
trajectory
as
it
did
harry
saw
in
it
a
direct
attempt
against
himself
and
his
father
or
even
against
the
engineer
chapter
vi
simon
ford
s
experiment
the
old
clock
in
the
cottage
struck
one
as
james
starr
and
his
two
companions
went
out
a
dim
light
penetrated
through
the
ventilating
shaft
into
the
glade
harry
s
lamp
was
not
necessary
here
but
it
would
very
soon
be
of
use
for
the
old
overman
was
about
to
conduct
the
engineer
to
the
very
end
of
the
dochart
pit
after
following
the
principal
gallery
for
a
distance
of
two
miles
the
three
explorers
for
as
will
be
seen
this
was
a
regular
exploration
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
a
narrow
tunnel
it
was
like
a
nave
the
roof
of
which
rested
on
woodwork
covered
with
white
moss
it
followed
very
nearly
the
line
traced
by
the
course
of
the
river
forth
fifteen
hundred
feet
above
so
we
are
going
to
the
end
of
the
last
vein
said
james
starr
ay
you
know
the
mine
well
well
simon
returned
the
engineer
it
will
be
difficult
to
go
further
than
that
if
i
don
t
yes
indeed
starr
that
was
where
our
picks
tore
out
the
last
bit
of
coal
in
the
seam
i
remember
it
as
if
it
were
yesterday
i
myself
gave
that
last
blow
and
it
in
my
heart
more
dismally
than
on
the
rock
only
sandstone
and
schist
were
round
us
after
that
and
when
the
truck
rolled
towards
the
shaft
i
followed
with
my
heart
as
full
as
though
it
were
a
funeral
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
soul
of
the
mine
was
going
with
the
gravity
with
which
the
old
man
uttered
these
words
impressed
the
engineer
who
was
not
far
from
sharing
his
sentiments
they
were
those
of
the
sailor
who
leaves
his
disabled
vessel
of
the
proprietor
who
sees
the
house
of
his
ancestors
pulled
down
he
pressed
ford
s
hand
but
now
the
latter
seized
that
of
the
engineer
and
wringing
it
that
day
we
were
all
of
us
mistaken
he
exclaimed
no
the
old
mine
was
not
dead
it
was
not
a
corpse
that
the
miners
abandoned
and
i
dare
to
assert
starr
that
its
heart
beats
speak
ford
have
you
discovered
a
new
vein
cried
the
engineer
unable
to
contain
himself
i
know
you
have
your
letter
could
mean
nothing
mr
starr
said
simon
ford
i
did
not
wish
to
tell
any
man
but
and
you
did
quite
right
ford
but
tell
me
how
by
what
signs
are
you
sure
listen
sir
resumed
simon
it
is
not
a
seam
that
i
have
what
is
it
then
only
positive
proof
that
such
a
seam
and
the
proof
could
issue
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
if
coal
was
not
there
to
produce
it
no
certainly
not
replied
the
engineer
no
coal
no
no
effects
without
a
just
as
no
smoke
without
and
have
you
recognized
the
presence
of
light
carburetted
hydrogen
an
old
miner
could
not
be
deceived
answered
ford
i
have
met
with
our
old
enemy
the
but
suppose
it
was
another
gas
said
starr
firedamp
is
almost
without
smell
and
colorless
it
only
really
betrays
its
presence
by
an
mr
starr
said
simon
ford
will
you
let
me
tell
you
what
i
have
done
harry
had
once
or
twice
observed
something
remarkable
in
his
excursions
to
the
west
end
of
the
mine
fire
which
suddenly
went
out
sometimes
appeared
along
the
face
of
the
rock
or
on
the
embankment
of
the
further
galleries
how
those
flames
were
lighted
i
could
not
and
can
not
say
but
they
were
evidently
owing
to
the
presence
of
and
to
me
means
a
vein
of
did
not
these
fires
cause
any
explosion
asked
the
engineer
quickly
yes
little
partial
explosions
replied
ford
such
as
i
used
to
cause
myself
when
i
wished
to
ascertain
the
presence
of
do
you
remember
how
formerly
it
was
the
custom
to
try
to
prevent
explosions
before
our
good
genius
humphry
davy
invented
his
yes
replied
james
starr
you
mean
what
the
monk
as
the
men
called
him
used
to
do
but
i
have
never
seen
him
in
the
exercise
of
his
indeed
starr
you
are
too
young
in
spite
of
your
years
to
have
seen
that
but
i
ten
years
older
often
saw
the
last
monk
working
in
the
mine
he
was
called
so
because
he
wore
a
long
robe
like
a
monk
his
proper
name
was
the
at
that
time
there
was
no
other
means
of
destroying
the
bad
gas
but
by
dispersing
it
in
little
explosions
before
its
buoyancy
had
collected
it
in
too
great
quantities
in
the
heights
of
the
galleries
the
monk
as
we
called
him
with
his
face
masked
his
head
muffled
up
all
his
body
tightly
wrapped
in
a
thick
felt
cloak
crawled
along
the
ground
he
could
breathe
down
there
when
the
air
was
pure
and
with
his
right
hand
he
waved
above
his
head
a
blazing
torch
when
the
firedamp
had
accumulated
in
the
air
so
as
to
form
a
detonating
mixture
the
explosion
occurred
without
being
fatal
and
by
often
renewing
this
operation
catastrophes
were
prevented
sometimes
the
monk
was
injured
or
killed
in
his
work
then
another
took
his
place
this
was
done
in
all
mines
until
the
davy
lamp
was
universally
adopted
but
i
knew
the
plan
and
by
its
means
i
discovered
the
presence
of
firedamp
and
consequently
that
of
a
new
seam
of
coal
in
the
dochart
all
that
the
old
overman
had
related
of
the
monk
or
fireman
was
perfectly
true
the
air
in
the
galleries
of
mines
was
formerly
always
purified
in
the
way
described
or
carburetted
hydrogen
is
colorless
almost
scentless
it
burns
with
a
blue
flame
and
makes
respiration
impossible
the
miner
could
not
live
in
a
place
filled
with
this
injurious
gas
any
more
than
one
could
live
in
a
gasometer
full
of
common
gas
moreover
as
well
as
the
latter
a
mixture
of
inflammable
gases
forms
a
detonating
mixture
as
soon
as
the
air
unites
with
it
in
a
proportion
of
eight
and
perhaps
even
five
to
the
hundred
when
this
mixture
is
lighted
by
any
cause
there
is
an
explosion
almost
always
followed
by
a
frightful
catastrophe
as
they
walked
on
simon
ford
told
the
engineer
all
that
he
had
done
to
attain
his
object
how
he
was
sure
that
the
escape
of
took
place
at
the
very
end
of
the
farthest
gallery
in
its
western
part
because
he
had
provoked
small
and
partial
explosions
or
rather
little
flames
enough
to
show
the
nature
of
the
gas
which
escaped
in
a
small
jet
but
with
a
continuous
flow
an
hour
after
leaving
the
cottage
james
starr
and
his
two
companions
had
gone
a
distance
of
four
miles
the
engineer
urged
by
anxiety
and
hope
walked
on
without
noticing
the
length
of
the
way
he
pondered
over
all
that
the
old
miner
had
told
him
and
mentally
weighed
all
the
arguments
which
the
latter
had
given
in
support
of
his
belief
he
agreed
with
him
in
thinking
that
the
continued
emission
of
carburetted
hydrogen
certainly
showed
the
existence
of
a
new
if
it
had
been
merely
a
sort
of
pocket
full
of
gas
as
it
is
sometimes
found
amongst
the
rock
it
would
soon
have
been
empty
and
the
phenomenon
have
ceased
but
far
from
that
according
to
simon
ford
the
escaped
incessantly
and
from
that
fact
the
existence
of
an
important
vein
might
be
considered
certain
consequently
the
riches
of
the
dochart
pit
were
not
entirely
exhausted
the
chief
question
now
was
whether
this
was
merely
a
vein
which
would
yield
comparatively
little
or
a
bed
occupying
a
large
extent
harry
who
preceded
his
father
and
the
engineer
stopped
here
we
are
exclaimed
the
old
miner
at
last
thank
heaven
you
are
here
starr
and
we
shall
soon
the
old
overman
s
voice
trembled
slightly
be
calm
my
man
said
the
engineer
i
am
as
excited
as
you
are
but
we
must
not
lose
the
gallery
at
this
end
of
the
pit
widened
into
a
sort
of
dark
cave
no
shaft
had
been
pierced
in
this
part
and
the
gallery
bored
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
had
no
direct
communication
with
the
surface
of
the
earth
james
starr
with
intense
interest
examined
the
place
in
which
they
were
standing
on
the
walls
of
the
cavern
the
marks
of
the
pick
could
still
be
seen
and
even
holes
in
which
the
rock
had
been
blasted
near
the
termination
of
the
working
the
schist
was
excessively
hard
and
it
had
not
been
necessary
to
bank
up
the
end
of
the
tunnel
where
the
works
had
come
to
an
end
there
the
vein
had
failed
between
the
schist
and
the
tertiary
sandstone
from
this
very
place
had
been
extracted
the
last
piece
of
coal
from
the
dochart
pit
we
must
attack
the
dyke
said
ford
raising
his
pick
for
at
the
other
side
of
the
break
at
more
or
less
depth
we
shall
assuredly
find
the
vein
the
existence
of
which
i
and
was
it
on
the
surface
of
these
rocks
that
you
found
out
the
asked
james
starr
just
there
sir
returned
ford
and
i
was
able
to
light
it
only
by
bringing
my
lamp
near
to
the
cracks
in
the
rock
harry
has
done
it
as
well
as
at
what
height
asked
starr
ten
feet
from
the
ground
replied
harry
james
starr
had
seated
himself
on
a
rock
after
critically
inhaling
the
air
of
the
cavern
he
gazed
at
the
two
miners
almost
as
if
doubting
their
words
decided
as
they
were
in
fact
carburetted
hydrogen
is
not
completely
scentless
and
the
engineer
whose
sense
of
smell
was
very
keen
was
astonished
that
it
had
not
revealed
the
presence
of
the
explosive
gas
at
any
rate
if
the
gas
had
mingled
at
all
with
the
surrounding
air
it
could
only
be
in
a
very
small
stream
there
was
no
danger
of
an
explosion
and
they
might
without
fear
open
the
safety
lamp
to
try
the
experiment
just
as
the
old
miner
had
done
before
what
troubled
james
starr
was
not
lest
too
much
gas
mingled
with
the
air
but
lest
there
should
be
little
or
none
could
they
have
been
mistaken
he
murmured
no
these
men
know
what
they
are
about
and
yet
he
waited
not
without
some
anxiety
until
simon
ford
s
phenomenon
should
have
taken
place
but
just
then
it
seemed
that
harry
like
himself
had
remarked
the
absence
of
the
characteristic
odor
of
for
he
exclaimed
in
an
altered
voice
father
i
should
say
the
gas
was
no
longer
escaping
through
the
cracks
no
longer
cried
the
old
miner
and
pressing
his
lips
tight
together
he
snuffed
the
air
several
times
then
all
at
once
with
a
sudden
movement
hand
me
your
lamp
harry
he
said
ford
took
the
lamp
with
a
trembling
hand
he
drew
off
the
wire
gauze
case
which
surrounded
the
wick
and
the
flame
burned
in
the
open
air
as
they
had
expected
there
was
no
explosion
but
what
was
more
serious
there
was
not
even
the
slight
crackling
which
indicates
the
presence
of
a
small
quantity
of
firedamp
simon
took
the
stick
which
harry
was
holding
fixed
his
lamp
to
the
end
of
it
and
raised
it
high
above
his
head
up
to
where
the
gas
by
reason
of
its
buoyancy
would
naturally
accumulate
the
flame
of
the
lamp
burning
straight
and
clear
revealed
no
trace
of
the
carburetted
hydrogen
close
to
the
wall
said
the
engineer
yes
responded
ford
carrying
the
lamp
to
that
part
of
the
wall
at
which
he
and
his
son
had
the
evening
before
proved
the
escape
of
gas
the
old
miner
s
arm
trembled
whilst
he
tried
to
hoist
the
lamp
up
take
my
place
harry
said
he
harry
took
the
stick
and
successively
presented
the
lamp
to
the
different
fissures
in
the
rock
but
he
shook
his
head
for
of
that
slight
crackling
peculiar
to
escaping
he
heard
nothing
there
was
no
flame
evidently
not
a
particle
of
gas
was
escaping
through
the
rock
nothing
cried
ford
clenching
his
fist
with
a
gesture
rather
of
anger
than
disappointment
a
cry
escaped
harry
what
s
the
matter
asked
starr
quickly
someone
has
stopped
up
the
cracks
in
the
schist
is
that
true
exclaimed
the
old
miner
look
father
harry
was
not
mistaken
the
obstruction
of
the
fissures
was
clearly
visible
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
it
had
been
recently
done
with
lime
leaving
on
the
rock
a
long
whitish
mark
badly
concealed
with
coal
dust
it
s
he
exclaimed
harry
it
can
only
be
he
he
repeated
james
starr
in
amazement
yes
returned
the
young
man
that
mysterious
being
who
haunts
our
domain
for
whom
i
have
watched
a
hundred
times
without
being
able
to
get
at
him
the
author
we
may
now
be
certain
of
that
letter
which
was
intended
to
hinder
you
from
coming
to
see
my
father
starr
and
who
finally
threw
that
stone
at
us
in
the
gallery
of
the
yarrow
shaft
ah
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
there
is
a
man
s
hand
in
all
that
harry
spoke
with
such
energy
that
conviction
came
instantly
and
fully
to
the
engineer
s
mind
as
to
the
old
overman
he
was
already
convinced
besides
there
they
were
in
the
presence
of
an
undeniable
fact
the
of
cracks
through
which
gas
had
escaped
freely
the
night
before
take
your
pick
harry
cried
ford
mount
on
my
shoulders
my
lad
i
am
still
strong
enough
to
bear
you
the
young
man
understood
in
an
instant
his
father
propped
himself
up
against
the
rock
harry
got
upon
his
shoulders
so
that
with
his
pick
he
could
reach
the
line
of
the
fissure
then
with
quick
sharp
blows
he
attacked
it
almost
directly
afterwards
a
slight
sound
was
heard
like
champagne
escaping
from
a
bottle
a
sound
commonly
expressed
by
the
word
harry
again
seized
his
lamp
and
held
it
to
the
opening
there
was
a
slight
report
and
a
little
red
flame
rather
blue
at
its
outline
flickered
over
the
rock
like
a
harry
leaped
to
the
ground
and
the
old
overman
unable
to
contain
his
joy
grasped
the
engineer
s
hands
exclaiming
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
starr
the
burns
the
vein
is
there
chapter
vii
new
aberfoyle
the
old
overman
s
experiment
had
succeeded
firedamp
it
is
well
known
is
only
generated
in
coal
seams
therefore
the
existence
of
a
vein
of
precious
combustible
could
no
longer
be
doubted
as
to
its
size
and
quality
that
must
be
determined
later
yes
thought
james
starr
behind
that
wall
lies
a
carboniferous
bed
undiscovered
by
our
soundings
it
is
vexatious
that
all
the
apparatus
of
the
mine
deserted
for
ten
years
must
be
set
up
anew
never
mind
we
have
found
the
vein
which
was
thought
to
be
exhausted
and
this
time
it
shall
be
worked
to
the
end
well
starr
asked
ford
what
do
you
think
of
our
discovery
was
i
wrong
to
trouble
you
are
you
sorry
to
have
paid
this
visit
to
the
dochart
pit
no
no
my
old
friend
answered
starr
we
have
not
lost
our
time
but
we
shall
be
losing
it
now
if
we
do
not
return
immediately
to
the
cottage
we
will
come
back
here
we
will
blast
this
wall
with
dynamite
we
will
lay
open
the
new
vein
and
after
a
series
of
soundings
if
the
seam
appears
to
be
large
i
will
form
a
new
aberfoyle
company
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
old
shareholders
before
three
months
have
passed
the
first
corves
full
of
coal
will
have
been
taken
from
the
new
well
said
sir
cried
simon
ford
the
old
mine
will
grow
young
again
like
a
widow
who
remarries
the
bustle
of
the
old
days
will
soon
begin
with
the
blows
of
the
pick
and
mattock
blasts
of
powder
rumbling
of
wagons
neighing
of
horses
creaking
of
machines
i
shall
see
it
all
again
i
hope
starr
that
you
will
not
think
me
too
old
to
resume
my
duties
of
overman
no
simon
no
indeed
you
wear
better
than
i
do
my
old
friend
and
sir
you
shall
be
our
viewer
again
may
the
new
working
last
for
many
years
and
pray
heaven
i
shall
have
the
consolation
of
dying
without
seeing
the
end
of
it
the
old
miner
was
overflowing
with
joy
james
starr
fully
entered
into
it
but
he
let
ford
rave
for
them
both
harry
alone
remained
thoughtful
to
his
memory
recurred
the
succession
of
singular
inexplicable
circumstances
attending
the
discovery
of
the
new
bed
it
made
him
uneasy
about
the
future
an
hour
afterwards
james
starr
and
his
two
companions
were
back
in
the
cottage
the
engineer
supped
with
good
appetite
listening
with
satisfaction
to
all
the
plans
unfolded
by
the
old
overman
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
excitement
about
the
next
day
s
work
he
would
never
have
slept
better
than
in
the
perfect
stillness
of
the
cottage
the
following
day
after
a
substantial
breakfast
james
starr
simon
ford
harry
and
even
madge
herself
took
the
road
already
traversed
the
day
before
all
looked
like
regular
miners
they
carried
different
tools
and
some
dynamite
with
which
to
blast
the
rock
harry
besides
a
large
lantern
took
a
safety
lamp
which
would
burn
for
twelve
hours
it
was
more
than
was
necessary
for
the
journey
there
and
back
including
the
time
for
the
working
supposing
a
working
was
possible
to
work
to
work
shouted
ford
when
the
party
reached
the
further
end
of
the
passage
and
he
grasped
a
heavy
crowbar
and
brandished
it
stop
one
instant
said
starr
let
us
see
if
any
change
has
taken
place
and
if
the
still
escapes
through
the
you
are
right
starr
said
harry
whoever
stopped
it
up
yesterday
may
have
done
it
again
madge
seated
on
a
rock
carefully
observed
the
excavation
and
the
wall
which
was
to
be
blasted
it
was
found
that
everything
was
just
as
they
left
it
the
crevices
had
undergone
no
alteration
the
carburetted
hydrogen
still
filtered
through
though
in
a
small
stream
which
was
no
doubt
because
it
had
had
a
free
passage
since
the
day
before
as
the
quantity
was
so
small
it
could
not
have
formed
an
explosive
mixture
with
the
air
inside
james
starr
and
his
companions
could
therefore
proceed
in
security
besides
the
air
grew
purer
by
rising
to
the
heights
of
the
dochart
pit
and
the
spreading
through
the
atmosphere
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
make
any
explosion
to
work
then
repeated
ford
and
soon
the
rock
flew
in
splinters
under
his
skillful
blows
the
break
was
chiefly
composed
of
interspersed
with
sandstone
and
schist
such
as
is
most
often
met
with
between
the
coal
veins
james
starr
picked
up
some
of
the
pieces
and
examined
them
carefully
hoping
to
discover
some
trace
of
coal
starr
having
chosen
the
place
where
the
holes
were
to
be
drilled
they
were
rapidly
bored
by
harry
some
cartridges
of
dynamite
were
put
into
them
as
soon
as
the
long
tarred
safety
match
was
laid
it
was
lighted
on
a
level
with
the
ground
james
starr
and
his
companions
then
went
off
to
some
distance
oh
starr
said
simon
ford
a
prey
to
agitation
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
never
no
never
has
my
old
heart
beaten
so
quick
before
i
am
longing
to
get
at
the
vein
patience
simon
responded
the
engineer
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
you
think
you
are
going
to
find
a
passage
all
ready
open
behind
that
dyke
excuse
me
sir
answered
the
old
overman
but
of
course
i
think
so
if
there
was
good
luck
in
the
way
harry
and
i
discovered
this
place
why
shouldn
t
the
good
luck
go
on
as
he
spoke
came
the
explosion
a
sound
as
of
thunder
rolled
through
the
labyrinth
of
subterranean
galleries
starr
madge
harry
and
simon
ford
hastened
towards
the
spot
mr
starr
starr
shouted
the
overman
look
the
door
is
broken
open
ford
s
comparison
was
justified
by
the
appearance
of
an
excavation
the
depth
of
which
could
not
be
calculated
harry
was
about
to
spring
through
the
opening
but
the
engineer
though
excessively
surprised
to
find
this
cavity
held
him
back
allow
time
for
the
air
in
there
to
get
pure
said
he
yes
beware
of
the
foul
air
said
simon
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
passed
in
anxious
waiting
the
lantern
was
then
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
stick
and
introduced
into
the
cave
where
it
continued
to
burn
with
unaltered
brilliancy
now
then
harry
go
said
starr
and
we
will
follow
the
opening
made
by
the
dynamite
was
sufficiently
large
to
allow
a
man
to
pass
through
harry
lamp
in
hand
entered
unhesitatingly
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
his
father
mother
and
james
starr
waited
in
silence
a
minute
which
seemed
to
them
much
longer
passed
harry
did
not
reappear
did
not
call
gazing
into
the
opening
james
starr
could
not
even
see
the
light
of
his
lamp
which
ought
to
have
illuminated
the
dark
cavern
had
the
ground
suddenly
given
way
under
harry
s
feet
had
the
young
miner
fallen
into
some
crevice
could
his
voice
no
longer
reach
his
companions
the
old
overman
dead
to
their
remonstrances
was
about
to
enter
the
opening
when
a
light
appeared
dim
at
first
but
gradually
growing
brighter
and
harry
s
voice
was
heard
shouting
come
starr
come
father
the
road
to
new
aberfoyle
is
open
if
by
some
superhuman
power
engineers
could
have
raised
in
a
block
a
thousand
feet
thick
all
that
portion
of
the
terrestrial
crust
which
supports
the
lakes
rivers
gulfs
and
territories
of
the
counties
of
stirling
dumbarton
and
renfrew
they
would
have
found
under
that
enormous
lid
an
immense
excavation
to
which
but
one
other
in
the
world
can
be
compared
the
celebrated
mammoth
caves
of
kentucky
this
excavation
was
composed
of
several
hundred
divisions
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
it
might
be
called
a
hive
with
numberless
ranges
of
cells
capriciously
arranged
but
a
hive
on
a
vast
scale
and
which
instead
of
bees
might
have
lodged
all
the
ichthyosauri
megatheriums
and
pterodactyles
of
the
geological
epoch
a
labyrinth
of
galleries
some
higher
than
the
most
lofty
cathedrals
others
like
cloisters
narrow
and
winding
these
following
a
horizontal
line
those
on
an
incline
or
running
obliquely
in
all
directions
connected
the
caverns
and
allowed
free
communication
between
them
the
pillars
sustaining
the
vaulted
roofs
whose
curves
allowed
of
every
style
the
massive
walls
between
the
passages
the
naves
themselves
in
this
layer
of
secondary
formation
were
composed
of
sandstone
and
schistous
rocks
but
tightly
packed
between
these
useless
strata
ran
valuable
veins
of
coal
as
if
the
black
blood
of
this
strange
mine
had
circulated
through
their
tangled
network
these
fields
extended
forty
miles
north
and
south
and
stretched
even
under
the
caledonian
canal
the
importance
of
this
bed
could
not
be
calculated
until
after
soundings
but
it
would
certainly
surpass
those
of
cardiff
and
newcastle
we
may
add
that
the
working
of
this
mine
would
be
singularly
facilitated
by
the
fantastic
dispositions
of
the
secondary
earths
for
by
an
unaccountable
retreat
of
the
mineral
matter
at
the
geological
epoch
when
the
mass
was
solidifying
nature
had
already
multiplied
the
galleries
and
tunnels
of
new
aberfoyle
yes
nature
alone
it
might
at
first
have
been
supposed
that
some
works
abandoned
for
centuries
had
been
discovered
afresh
nothing
of
the
sort
no
one
would
have
deserted
such
riches
human
termites
had
never
gnawed
away
this
part
of
the
scottish
subsoil
nature
herself
had
done
it
all
but
we
repeat
it
could
be
compared
to
nothing
but
the
celebrated
mammoth
caves
which
in
an
extent
of
more
than
twenty
miles
contain
two
hundred
and
avenues
eleven
lakes
seven
rivers
eight
cataracts
unfathomable
wells
and
domes
some
of
which
are
more
than
four
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
like
these
caves
new
aberfoyle
was
not
the
work
of
men
but
the
work
of
the
creator
such
was
this
new
domain
of
matchless
wealth
the
discovery
of
which
belonged
entirely
to
the
old
overman
ten
years
sojourn
in
the
deserted
mine
an
uncommon
pertinacity
in
research
perfect
faith
sustained
by
a
marvelous
mining
instinct
all
these
qualities
together
led
him
to
succeed
where
so
many
others
had
failed
why
had
the
soundings
made
under
the
direction
of
james
starr
during
the
last
years
of
the
working
stopped
just
at
that
limit
on
the
very
frontier
of
the
new
mine
that
was
all
chance
which
takes
great
part
in
researches
of
this
kind
however
that
might
be
there
was
under
the
scottish
subsoil
what
might
be
called
a
subterranean
county
which
to
be
habitable
needed
only
the
rays
of
the
sun
or
for
want
of
that
the
light
of
a
special
planet
water
had
collected
in
various
hollows
forming
vast
ponds
or
rather
lakes
larger
than
loch
katrine
lying
just
above
them
of
course
the
waters
of
these
lakes
had
no
movement
of
currents
or
tides
no
old
castle
was
reflected
there
no
birch
or
oak
trees
waved
on
their
banks
and
yet
these
deep
lakes
whose
surface
was
never
ruffled
by
a
breeze
would
not
be
without
charm
by
the
light
of
some
electric
star
and
connected
by
a
string
of
canals
would
well
complete
the
geography
of
this
strange
domain
although
unfit
for
any
vegetable
production
the
place
could
be
inhabited
by
a
whole
population
and
who
knows
but
that
in
this
steady
temperature
in
the
depths
of
the
mines
of
aberfoyle
as
well
as
in
those
of
newcastle
alloa
or
cardiff
when
their
contents
shall
have
been
exhausted
who
knows
but
that
the
poorer
classes
of
great
britain
will
some
day
find
a
refuge
chapter
viii
exploring
at
harry
s
call
james
starr
madge
and
simon
ford
entered
through
the
narrow
orifice
which
put
the
dochart
pit
in
communication
with
the
new
mine
they
found
themselves
at
the
beginning
of
a
tolerably
wide
gallery
one
might
well
believe
that
it
had
been
pierced
by
the
hand
of
man
that
the
pick
and
mattock
had
emptied
it
in
the
working
of
a
new
vein
the
explorers
question
whether
by
a
strange
chance
they
had
not
been
transported
into
some
ancient
mine
of
the
existence
of
which
even
the
oldest
miners
in
the
county
had
ever
known
no
it
was
merely
that
the
geological
layers
had
left
this
passage
when
the
secondary
earths
were
in
course
of
formation
perhaps
some
torrent
had
formerly
dashed
through
it
but
now
it
was
as
dry
as
if
it
had
been
cut
some
thousand
feet
lower
through
granite
rocks
at
the
same
time
the
air
circulated
freely
which
showed
that
certain
natural
vents
placed
it
in
communication
with
the
exterior
atmosphere
this
observation
made
by
the
engineer
was
correct
and
it
was
evident
that
the
ventilation
of
the
new
mine
would
be
easily
managed
as
to
the
which
had
lately
filtered
through
the
schist
it
seemed
to
have
been
contained
in
a
pocket
now
empty
and
it
was
certain
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
gallery
was
quite
free
from
it
however
harry
prudently
carried
only
the
safety
lamp
which
would
insure
light
for
twelve
hours
james
starr
and
his
companions
now
felt
perfectly
happy
all
their
wishes
were
satisfied
there
was
nothing
but
coal
around
them
a
sort
of
emotion
kept
them
silent
even
simon
ford
restrained
himself
his
joy
overflowed
not
in
long
phrases
but
in
short
ejaculations
it
was
perhaps
imprudent
to
venture
so
far
into
the
crypt
pooh
they
never
thought
of
how
they
were
to
get
back
the
gallery
was
practicable
not
very
winding
they
met
with
no
noxious
exhalations
nor
did
any
chasm
bar
the
path
there
was
no
reason
for
stopping
for
a
whole
hour
james
starr
madge
harry
and
simon
ford
walked
on
though
there
was
nothing
to
show
them
what
was
the
exact
direction
of
this
unknown
tunnel
and
they
would
no
doubt
have
gone
farther
still
if
they
had
not
suddenly
come
to
the
end
of
the
wide
road
which
they
had
followed
since
their
entrance
into
the
mine
the
gallery
ended
in
an
enormous
cavern
neither
the
height
nor
depth
of
which
could
be
calculated
at
what
altitude
arched
the
roof
of
this
excavation
at
what
distance
was
its
opposite
wall
the
darkness
totally
concealed
but
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
the
explorers
could
discover
that
its
dome
covered
a
vast
extent
of
still
water
pond
or
lake
whose
picturesque
rocky
banks
were
lost
in
obscurity
halt
exclaimed
ford
stopping
suddenly
another
step
and
perhaps
we
shall
fall
into
some
fathomless
let
us
rest
awhile
then
my
friends
returned
the
engineer
besides
we
ought
to
be
thinking
of
returning
to
the
our
lamp
will
give
light
for
another
ten
hours
sir
said
harry
well
let
us
make
a
halt
replied
starr
i
confess
my
legs
have
need
of
a
rest
and
you
madge
don
t
you
feel
tired
after
so
long
a
walk
not
over
much
starr
replied
the
sturdy
scotchwoman
we
have
been
accustomed
to
explore
the
old
aberfoyle
mine
for
whole
days
tired
nonsense
interrupted
simon
ford
madge
could
go
ten
times
as
far
if
necessary
but
once
more
starr
wasn
t
my
communication
worth
your
trouble
in
coming
to
hear
it
just
dare
to
say
no
starr
dare
to
say
no
well
my
old
friend
i
haven
t
felt
so
happy
for
a
long
while
replied
the
engineer
the
small
part
of
this
marvelous
mine
that
we
have
explored
seems
to
show
that
its
extent
is
very
considerable
at
least
in
in
width
and
in
depth
too
starr
returned
simon
ford
that
we
shall
know
and
i
can
answer
for
it
trust
to
the
instinct
of
an
old
miner
it
has
never
deceived
me
i
wish
to
believe
you
simon
replied
the
engineer
smiling
as
far
as
i
can
judge
from
this
short
exploration
we
possess
the
elements
of
a
working
which
will
last
for
centuries
centuries
exclaimed
simon
ford
i
believe
you
sir
a
thousand
years
and
more
will
pass
before
the
last
bit
of
coal
is
taken
out
of
our
new
mine
heaven
grant
it
returned
starr
as
to
the
quality
of
the
coal
which
crops
out
of
these
walls
superb
starr
superb
answered
ford
just
look
at
it
yourself
and
so
saying
with
his
pick
he
struck
off
a
fragment
of
the
black
rock
look
look
he
repeated
holding
it
close
to
his
lamp
the
surface
of
this
piece
of
coal
is
shining
we
have
here
fat
coal
rich
in
bituminous
matter
and
see
how
it
comes
in
pieces
almost
without
dust
ah
starr
twenty
years
ago
this
seam
would
have
entered
into
a
strong
competition
with
swansea
and
cardiff
well
stokers
will
quarrel
for
it
still
and
if
it
costs
little
to
extract
it
from
the
mine
it
will
not
sell
at
a
less
price
indeed
said
madge
who
had
taken
the
fragment
of
coal
and
was
examining
it
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
that
s
good
quality
of
coal
carry
it
home
simon
carry
it
back
to
the
cottage
i
want
this
first
piece
of
coal
to
burn
under
our
well
said
wife
answered
the
old
overman
and
you
shall
see
that
i
am
not
mr
starr
asked
harry
have
you
any
idea
of
the
probable
direction
of
this
long
passage
which
we
have
been
following
since
our
entrance
into
the
new
mine
no
my
lad
replied
the
engineer
with
a
compass
i
could
perhaps
find
out
its
general
bearing
but
without
a
compass
i
am
here
like
a
sailor
in
open
sea
in
the
midst
of
fogs
when
there
is
no
sun
by
which
to
calculate
his
no
doubt
starr
replied
ford
but
pray
don
t
compare
our
position
with
that
of
the
sailor
who
has
everywhere
and
always
an
abyss
under
his
feet
we
are
on
firm
ground
here
and
need
never
be
afraid
of
i
won
t
tease
you
then
old
simon
answered
james
starr
far
be
it
from
me
even
in
jest
to
depreciate
the
new
aberfoyle
mine
by
an
unjust
comparison
i
only
meant
to
say
one
thing
and
that
is
that
we
don
t
know
where
we
we
are
in
the
subsoil
of
the
county
of
stirling
starr
replied
simon
ford
and
that
i
assert
as
if
listen
said
harry
interrupting
the
old
man
all
listened
as
the
young
miner
was
doing
his
ears
which
were
very
sharp
had
caught
a
dull
sound
like
a
distant
murmur
his
companions
were
not
long
in
hearing
it
themselves
it
was
above
their
heads
a
sort
of
rolling
sound
in
which
though
it
was
so
feeble
the
successive
crescendo
and
diminuendo
could
be
distinctly
heard
all
four
stood
for
some
minutes
their
ears
on
the
stretch
without
uttering
a
word
all
at
once
simon
ford
exclaimed
well
i
declare
are
trucks
already
running
on
the
rails
of
new
aberfoyle
father
replied
harry
it
sounds
to
me
just
like
the
noise
made
by
waves
rolling
on
the
sea
we
can
t
be
under
the
sea
though
cried
the
old
overman
no
said
the
engineer
but
it
is
not
impossible
that
we
should
be
under
loch
the
roof
can
not
have
much
thickness
just
here
if
the
noise
of
the
water
is
very
little
indeed
answered
james
starr
and
that
is
the
reason
this
cavern
is
so
you
must
be
right
starr
said
harry
besides
the
weather
is
so
bad
outside
resumed
starr
that
the
waters
of
the
loch
must
be
as
rough
as
those
of
the
firth
of
well
what
does
it
matter
after
all
returned
simon
ford
the
seam
won
t
be
any
the
worse
because
it
is
under
a
loch
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
coal
has
been
looked
for
under
the
very
bed
of
the
ocean
when
we
have
to
work
under
the
bottom
of
the
caledonian
canal
where
will
be
the
harm
well
said
simon
cried
the
engineer
who
could
not
restrain
a
smile
at
the
overman
s
enthusiasm
let
us
cut
our
trenches
under
the
waters
of
the
sea
let
us
bore
the
bed
of
the
atlantic
like
a
strainer
let
us
with
our
picks
join
our
brethren
of
the
united
states
through
the
subsoil
of
the
ocean
let
us
dig
into
the
center
of
the
globe
if
necessary
to
tear
out
the
last
scrap
of
are
you
joking
starr
asked
ford
with
a
pleased
but
slightly
suspicious
look
i
joking
old
man
no
but
you
are
so
enthusiastic
that
you
carry
me
away
into
the
regions
of
impossibility
come
let
us
return
to
the
reality
which
is
sufficiently
beautiful
leave
our
picks
here
where
we
may
find
them
another
day
and
let
s
take
the
road
back
to
the
nothing
more
could
be
done
for
the
time
later
the
engineer
accompanied
by
a
brigade
of
miners
supplied
with
lamps
and
all
necessary
tools
would
resume
the
exploration
of
new
aberfoyle
it
was
now
time
to
return
to
the
dochart
pit
the
road
was
easy
the
gallery
running
nearly
straight
through
the
rock
up
to
the
orifice
opened
by
the
dynamite
so
there
was
no
fear
of
their
losing
themselves
but
as
james
starr
was
proceeding
towards
the
gallery
simon
ford
stopped
him
mr
starr
said
he
you
see
this
immense
cavern
this
subterranean
lake
whose
waters
bathe
this
strand
at
our
feet
well
it
is
to
this
place
i
mean
to
change
my
dwelling
here
i
will
build
a
new
cottage
and
if
some
brave
fellows
will
follow
my
example
before
a
year
is
over
there
will
be
one
town
more
inside
old
james
starr
smiling
approval
of
ford
s
plans
pressed
his
hand
and
all
three
preceding
madge
the
gallery
on
their
way
back
to
the
dochart
pit
for
the
first
mile
no
incident
occurred
harry
walked
first
holding
his
lamp
above
his
head
he
carefully
followed
the
principal
gallery
without
ever
turning
aside
into
the
narrow
tunnels
which
radiated
to
the
right
and
left
it
seemed
as
if
the
returning
was
to
be
accomplished
as
easily
as
the
going
when
an
unexpected
accident
occurred
which
rendered
the
situation
of
the
explorers
very
serious
just
at
a
moment
when
harry
was
raising
his
lamp
there
came
a
rush
of
air
as
if
caused
by
the
flapping
of
invisible
wings
the
lamp
escaped
from
his
hands
fell
on
the
rocky
ground
and
was
broken
to
pieces
james
starr
and
his
companions
were
suddenly
plunged
in
absolute
darkness
all
the
oil
of
the
lamp
was
spilt
and
it
was
of
no
further
use
well
harry
cried
his
father
do
you
want
us
all
to
break
our
necks
on
the
way
back
to
the
cottage
harry
did
not
answer
he
wondered
if
he
ought
to
suspect
the
hand
of
a
mysterious
being
in
this
last
accident
could
there
possibly
exist
in
these
depths
an
enemy
whose
unaccountable
antagonism
would
one
day
create
serious
difficulties
had
someone
an
interest
in
defending
the
new
coal
field
against
any
attempt
at
working
it
in
truth
that
seemed
absurd
yet
the
facts
spoke
for
themselves
and
they
accumulated
in
such
a
way
as
to
change
simple
presumptions
into
certainties
in
the
meantime
the
explorers
situation
was
bad
enough
they
had
now
in
the
midst
of
black
darkness
to
follow
the
passage
leading
to
the
dochart
pit
for
nearly
five
miles
there
they
would
still
have
an
hour
s
walk
before
reaching
the
cottage
come
along
said
simon
ford
we
have
no
time
to
lose
we
must
grope
our
way
along
like
blind
men
there
s
no
fear
of
losing
our
way
the
tunnels
which
open
off
our
road
are
only
just
like
those
in
a
molehill
and
by
following
the
chief
gallery
we
shall
of
course
reach
the
opening
we
got
in
at
after
that
it
is
the
old
mine
we
know
that
and
it
won
t
be
the
first
time
that
harry
and
i
have
found
ourselves
there
in
the
dark
besides
there
we
shall
find
the
lamps
that
we
left
forward
then
harry
go
first
starr
follow
him
madge
you
go
next
and
i
will
bring
up
the
rear
above
everything
don
t
let
us
get
all
complied
with
the
old
overman
s
instructions
as
he
said
by
groping
carefully
they
could
not
mistake
the
way
it
was
only
necessary
to
make
the
hands
take
the
place
of
the
eyes
and
to
trust
to
their
instinct
which
had
with
simon
ford
and
his
son
become
a
second
nature
james
starr
and
his
companions
walked
on
in
the
order
agreed
they
did
not
speak
but
it
was
not
for
want
of
thinking
it
became
evident
that
they
had
an
adversary
but
what
was
he
and
how
were
they
to
defend
themselves
against
these
attacks
these
disquieting
ideas
crowded
into
their
brains
however
this
was
not
the
moment
to
get
discouraged
harry
his
arms
extended
advanced
with
a
firm
step
touching
first
one
and
then
the
other
side
of
the
passage
if
a
cleft
or
side
opening
presented
itself
he
felt
with
his
hand
that
it
was
not
the
main
way
either
the
cleft
was
too
shallow
or
the
opening
too
narrow
and
he
thus
kept
in
the
right
road
in
darkness
through
which
the
eye
could
not
in
the
slightest
degree
pierce
this
difficult
return
lasted
two
hours
by
reckoning
the
time
since
they
started
taking
into
consideration
that
the
walking
had
not
been
rapid
starr
calculated
that
he
and
his
companions
were
near
the
opening
in
fact
almost
immediately
harry
stopped
have
we
got
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
asked
simon
ford
yes
answered
the
young
miner
well
have
you
not
found
the
hole
which
connects
new
aberfoyle
with
the
dochart
pit
no
replied
harry
whose
impatient
hands
met
with
nothing
but
a
solid
wall
the
old
overman
stepped
forward
and
himself
felt
the
schistous
rock
a
cry
escaped
him
either
the
explorers
had
strayed
from
the
right
path
on
their
return
or
the
narrow
orifice
broken
in
the
rock
by
the
dynamite
had
been
recently
stopped
up
james
starr
and
his
companions
were
prisoners
in
new
aberfoyle
chapter
ix
the
a
week
after
the
events
just
related
had
taken
place
james
starr
s
friends
had
become
very
anxious
the
engineer
had
disappeared
and
no
reason
could
be
brought
forward
to
explain
his
absence
they
learnt
by
questioning
his
servant
that
he
had
embarked
at
granton
pier
but
from
that
time
there
were
no
traces
of
james
starr
simon
ford
s
letter
had
requested
secrecy
and
he
had
said
nothing
of
his
departure
for
the
aberfoyle
mines
therefore
in
edinburgh
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
unaccountable
absence
of
the
engineer
sir
elphiston
the
president
of
the
royal
institution
communicated
to
his
colleagues
a
letter
which
james
starr
had
sent
him
excusing
himself
from
being
present
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
society
two
or
three
others
produced
similar
letters
but
though
these
documents
proved
that
starr
had
left
edinburgh
which
was
known
before
they
threw
no
light
on
what
had
become
of
him
now
on
the
part
of
such
a
man
this
prolonged
absence
so
contrary
to
his
usual
habits
naturally
first
caused
surprise
and
then
anxiety
a
notice
was
inserted
in
the
principal
newspapers
of
the
united
kingdom
relative
to
the
engineer
james
starr
giving
a
description
of
him
and
the
date
on
which
he
left
edinburgh
nothing
more
could
be
done
but
to
wait
the
time
passed
in
great
anxiety
the
scientific
world
of
england
was
inclined
to
believe
that
one
of
its
most
distinguished
members
had
positively
disappeared
at
the
same
time
when
so
many
people
were
thinking
about
james
starr
harry
ford
was
the
subject
of
no
less
anxiety
only
instead
of
occupying
public
attention
the
son
of
the
old
overman
was
the
cause
of
trouble
alone
to
the
generally
cheerful
mind
of
jack
ryan
it
may
be
remembered
that
in
their
encounter
in
the
yarrow
shaft
jack
ryan
had
invited
harry
to
come
a
week
afterwards
to
the
festivities
at
irvine
harry
had
accepted
and
promised
expressly
to
be
there
jack
ryan
knew
having
had
it
proved
by
many
circumstances
that
his
friend
was
a
man
of
his
word
with
him
a
thing
promised
was
a
thing
done
now
at
the
irvine
nothing
was
wanting
neither
song
nor
dance
nor
fun
of
any
sort
nothing
but
harry
ford
the
notice
relative
to
james
starr
published
in
the
papers
had
not
yet
been
seen
by
ryan
the
honest
fellow
was
therefore
only
worried
by
harry
s
absence
telling
himself
that
something
serious
could
alone
have
prevented
him
from
keeping
his
promise
so
the
day
after
the
irvine
games
jack
ryan
intended
to
take
the
railway
from
glasgow
and
go
to
the
dochart
pit
and
this
he
would
have
done
had
he
not
been
detained
by
an
accident
which
nearly
cost
him
his
life
something
which
occurred
on
the
night
of
the
of
december
was
of
a
nature
to
support
the
opinions
of
all
partisans
of
the
supernatural
and
there
were
many
at
melrose
farm
irvine
a
little
seaport
of
renfrew
containing
nearly
seven
thousand
inhabitants
lies
in
a
sharp
bend
made
by
the
scottish
coast
near
the
mouth
of
the
firth
of
clyde
the
most
ancient
and
the
most
famed
ruins
on
this
part
of
the
coast
were
those
of
this
castle
of
robert
stuart
which
bore
the
name
of
dundonald
castle
at
this
period
dundonald
castle
a
refuge
for
all
the
stray
goblins
of
the
country
was
completely
deserted
it
stood
on
the
top
of
a
high
rock
two
miles
from
the
town
and
was
seldom
visited
sometimes
a
few
strangers
took
it
into
their
heads
to
explore
these
old
historical
remains
but
then
they
always
went
alone
the
inhabitants
of
irvine
would
not
have
taken
them
there
at
any
price
indeed
several
legends
were
based
on
the
story
of
certain
who
haunted
the
old
castle
the
most
superstitious
declared
they
had
seen
these
fantastic
creatures
with
their
own
eyes
jack
ryan
was
naturally
one
of
them
it
was
a
fact
that
from
time
to
time
long
flames
appeared
sometimes
on
a
broken
piece
of
wall
sometimes
on
the
summit
of
the
tower
which
was
the
highest
point
of
dundonald
castle
did
these
flames
really
assume
a
human
shape
as
was
asserted
did
they
merit
the
name
of
given
them
by
the
people
of
the
coast
it
was
evidently
just
an
optical
delusion
aided
by
a
good
deal
of
credulity
and
science
could
easily
have
explained
the
phenomenon
however
that
might
be
these
had
the
reputation
of
frequenting
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
and
there
performing
wild
strathspeys
especially
on
dark
nights
jack
ryan
bold
fellow
though
he
was
would
never
have
dared
to
accompany
those
dances
with
the
music
of
his
bagpipes
old
nick
is
enough
for
them
said
he
he
doesn
t
need
me
to
complete
his
infernal
we
may
well
believe
that
these
strange
apparitions
frequently
furnished
a
text
for
the
evening
stories
jack
ryan
was
ending
the
evening
with
one
of
these
his
auditors
transported
into
the
phantom
world
were
worked
up
into
a
state
of
mind
which
would
believe
anything
all
at
once
shouts
were
heard
outside
jack
ryan
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
his
story
and
all
rushed
out
of
the
barn
the
night
was
pitchy
dark
squalls
of
wind
and
rain
swept
along
the
beach
two
or
three
fishermen
their
backs
against
a
rock
the
better
to
resist
the
wind
were
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
jack
ryan
and
his
companions
ran
up
to
them
the
shouts
were
however
not
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
farm
but
to
warn
men
who
without
being
aware
of
it
were
going
to
destruction
a
dark
confused
mass
appeared
some
way
out
at
sea
it
was
a
vessel
whose
position
could
be
seen
by
her
lights
for
she
carried
a
white
one
on
her
foremast
a
green
on
the
starboard
side
and
a
red
on
the
outside
she
was
evidently
running
straight
on
the
rocks
a
ship
in
distress
said
ryan
ay
answered
one
of
the
fishermen
and
now
they
want
to
tack
but
it
s
too
late
do
they
want
to
run
ashore
said
another
it
seems
so
responded
one
of
the
fishermen
unless
he
has
been
misled
by
some
the
man
was
interrupted
by
a
yell
from
jack
could
the
crew
have
heard
it
at
any
rate
it
was
too
late
for
them
to
beat
back
from
the
line
of
breakers
which
gleamed
white
in
the
darkness
but
it
was
not
as
might
be
supposed
a
last
effort
of
ryan
s
to
warn
the
doomed
ship
he
now
had
his
back
to
the
sea
his
companions
turned
also
and
gazed
at
a
spot
situated
about
half
a
mile
inland
it
was
dundonald
castle
a
long
flame
twisted
and
bent
under
the
gale
on
the
summit
of
the
old
tower
the
cried
the
superstitious
men
in
terror
clearly
it
needed
a
good
strong
imagination
to
find
any
human
likeness
in
that
flame
waving
in
the
wind
like
a
luminous
flag
it
seemed
sometimes
to
fly
round
the
tower
as
if
it
was
just
going
out
and
a
moment
after
it
was
seen
again
dancing
on
its
blue
point
the
the
cried
the
terrified
fishermen
and
peasants
all
was
then
explained
the
ship
having
lost
her
reckoning
in
the
fog
had
taken
this
flame
on
the
top
of
dundonald
castle
for
the
irvine
light
she
thought
herself
at
the
entrance
of
the
firth
ten
miles
to
the
north
when
she
was
really
running
on
a
shore
which
offered
no
refuge
what
could
be
done
to
save
her
if
there
was
still
time
it
was
too
late
a
frightful
crash
was
heard
above
the
tumult
of
the
elements
the
vessel
had
struck
the
white
line
of
surf
was
broken
for
an
instant
she
heeled
over
on
her
side
and
lay
among
the
rocks
at
the
same
time
by
a
strange
coincidence
the
long
flame
disappeared
as
if
it
had
been
swept
away
by
a
violent
gust
earth
sea
and
sky
were
plunged
in
complete
darkness
the
shouted
ryan
for
the
last
time
as
the
apparition
which
he
and
his
companions
believed
supernatural
disappeared
but
then
the
courage
of
these
superstitious
scotchmen
which
had
failed
before
a
fancied
danger
returned
in
face
of
a
real
one
which
they
were
ready
to
brave
in
order
to
save
their
the
tempest
did
not
deter
them
as
heroic
as
they
had
before
been
credulous
fastening
ropes
round
their
waists
they
rushed
into
the
waves
to
the
aid
of
those
on
the
wreck
happily
they
succeeded
in
their
endeavors
although
some
and
bold
jack
ryan
was
among
the
number
were
severely
wounded
on
the
rocks
but
the
captain
of
the
vessel
and
the
eight
sailors
who
composed
his
crew
were
hauled
up
safe
and
sound
on
the
beach
the
ship
was
the
norwegian
brig
motala
laden
with
timber
and
bound
for
glasgow
of
the
motala
herself
nothing
remained
but
a
few
spars
washed
up
by
the
waves
and
dashed
among
the
rocks
on
the
beach
jack
ryan
and
three
of
his
companions
wounded
like
himself
were
carried
into
a
room
of
melrose
farm
where
every
care
was
lavished
on
them
ryan
was
the
most
hurt
for
when
with
the
rope
round
his
waist
he
had
rushed
into
the
sea
the
waves
had
almost
immediately
dashed
him
back
against
the
rocks
he
was
brought
indeed
very
nearly
lifeless
on
to
the
beach
the
brave
fellow
was
therefore
confined
to
bed
for
several
days
to
his
great
disgust
however
as
soon
as
he
was
given
permission
to
sing
as
much
as
he
liked
he
bore
his
trouble
patiently
and
the
farm
echoed
all
day
with
his
jovial
voice
but
from
this
adventure
he
imbibed
a
more
lively
sentiment
of
fear
with
regard
to
brownies
and
other
goblins
who
amuse
themselves
by
plaguing
mankind
and
he
made
them
responsible
for
the
catastrophe
of
the
motala
it
would
have
been
vain
to
try
and
convince
him
that
the
did
not
exist
and
that
the
flame
so
suddenly
appearing
among
the
ruins
was
but
a
natural
phenomenon
no
reasoning
could
make
him
believe
it
his
companions
were
if
possible
more
obstinate
than
he
in
their
credulity
according
to
them
one
of
the
had
maliciously
attracted
the
motala
to
the
coast
as
to
wishing
to
punish
her
as
well
try
to
bring
the
tempest
to
justice
the
magistrates
might
order
what
arrests
they
pleased
but
a
flame
can
not
be
imprisoned
an
impalpable
being
can
t
be
handcuffed
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
researches
which
were
ultimately
made
gave
ground
at
least
in
appearance
to
this
superstitious
way
of
explaining
the
facts
the
inquiry
was
made
with
great
care
officials
came
to
dundonald
castle
and
they
proceeded
to
conduct
a
most
vigorous
search
the
magistrate
wished
first
to
ascertain
if
the
ground
bore
any
footprints
which
could
be
attributed
to
other
than
goblins
feet
it
was
impossible
to
find
the
least
trace
whether
old
or
new
moreover
the
earth
still
damp
from
the
rain
of
the
day
before
would
have
preserved
the
least
vestige
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
the
magistrates
only
got
for
their
trouble
a
new
legend
added
to
so
many
others
a
legend
which
would
be
perpetuated
by
the
remembrance
of
the
catastrophe
of
the
motala
and
indisputably
confirm
the
truth
of
the
apparition
of
the
a
hearty
fellow
like
jack
ryan
with
so
strong
a
constitution
could
not
be
long
confined
to
his
bed
a
few
sprains
and
bruises
were
not
quite
enough
to
keep
him
on
his
back
longer
than
he
liked
he
had
not
time
to
be
jack
therefore
soon
got
well
as
soon
as
he
was
on
his
legs
again
before
resuming
his
work
on
the
farm
he
wished
to
go
and
visit
his
friend
harry
and
learn
why
he
had
not
come
to
the
irvine
he
could
not
understand
his
absence
for
harry
was
not
a
man
who
would
willingly
promise
and
not
perform
it
was
unlikely
too
that
the
son
of
the
old
overman
had
not
heard
of
the
wreck
of
the
motala
as
it
was
in
all
the
papers
he
must
know
the
part
jack
had
taken
in
it
and
what
had
happened
to
him
and
it
was
unlike
harry
not
to
hasten
to
the
farm
and
see
how
his
old
chum
was
going
on
as
harry
had
not
come
there
must
have
been
something
to
prevent
him
jack
ryan
would
as
soon
deny
the
existence
of
the
as
believe
in
harry
s
indifference
two
days
after
the
catastrophe
jack
left
the
farm
merily
feeling
nothing
of
his
wounds
singing
in
the
fullness
of
his
heart
he
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
cliff
as
he
walked
to
the
station
of
the
railway
which
via
glasgow
would
take
him
to
stirling
and
callander
as
he
was
waiting
for
his
train
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
bill
posted
up
on
the
walls
containing
the
following
notice
on
the
of
december
the
engineer
james
starr
of
edinburgh
embarked
from
granton
pier
on
board
the
prince
of
wales
he
disembarked
the
same
day
at
stirling
from
that
time
nothing
further
has
been
heard
of
him
any
information
concerning
him
is
requested
to
be
sent
to
the
president
of
the
royal
institution
jack
ryan
stopping
before
one
of
these
advertisements
read
it
twice
over
with
extreme
surprise
mr
starr
he
exclaimed
why
on
the
of
december
i
met
him
with
harry
on
the
ladder
of
the
dochart
pit
that
was
ten
days
ago
and
he
has
not
been
seen
from
that
time
that
explains
why
my
chum
didn
t
come
to
and
without
taking
time
to
inform
the
president
of
the
royal
institution
by
letter
what
he
knew
relative
to
james
starr
jack
jumped
into
the
train
determining
to
go
first
of
all
to
the
yarrow
shaft
there
he
would
descend
to
the
depths
of
the
pit
if
necessary
to
find
harry
and
with
him
was
sure
to
be
the
engineer
james
starr
they
haven
t
turned
up
again
said
he
to
himself
why
has
anything
prevented
them
could
any
work
of
importance
keep
them
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
mine
i
must
find
out
and
ryan
hastening
his
steps
arrived
in
less
than
an
hour
at
the
yarrow
shaft
externally
nothing
was
changed
the
same
silence
around
not
a
living
creature
was
moving
in
that
desert
region
jack
entered
the
ruined
shed
which
covered
the
opening
of
the
shaft
he
gazed
down
into
the
dark
abyss
nothing
was
to
be
seen
he
listened
nothing
was
to
be
heard
and
my
lamp
he
exclaimed
suppose
it
isn
t
in
its
place
the
lamp
which
ryan
used
when
he
visited
the
pit
was
usually
deposited
in
a
corner
near
the
landing
of
the
topmost
ladder
it
had
disappeared
here
is
a
nuisance
said
jack
beginning
to
feel
rather
uneasy
then
without
hesitating
superstitious
though
he
was
i
will
go
said
he
though
it
s
as
dark
down
there
as
in
the
lowest
depths
of
the
infernal
regions
and
he
began
to
descend
the
long
flight
of
ladders
which
led
down
the
gloomy
shaft
jack
ryan
had
not
forgotten
his
old
mining
habits
and
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
dochart
pit
or
he
would
scarcely
have
dared
to
venture
thus
he
went
very
carefully
however
his
foot
tried
each
round
as
some
of
them
were
a
false
step
would
entail
a
deadly
fall
through
this
space
of
fifteen
hundred
feet
he
counted
each
landing
as
he
passed
it
knowing
that
he
could
not
reach
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
until
he
had
left
the
thirtieth
once
there
he
would
have
no
trouble
so
he
thought
in
finding
the
cottage
built
as
we
have
said
at
the
extremity
of
the
principal
passage
jack
ryan
went
on
thus
until
he
got
to
the
landing
and
consequently
had
two
hundred
feet
between
him
and
the
bottom
here
he
put
down
his
leg
to
feel
for
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder
but
his
foot
swinging
in
space
found
nothing
to
rest
on
he
knelt
down
and
felt
about
with
his
hand
for
the
top
of
the
ladder
it
was
in
vain
old
nick
himself
must
have
been
down
this
way
said
jack
not
without
a
slight
feeling
of
terror
he
stood
considering
for
some
time
with
folded
arms
and
longing
to
be
able
to
pierce
the
impenetrable
darkness
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
could
not
get
down
neither
could
the
inhabitants
of
the
mine
get
up
there
was
now
no
communication
between
the
depths
of
the
pit
and
the
upper
regions
if
the
removal
of
the
lower
ladders
of
the
yarrow
shaft
had
been
effected
since
his
last
visit
to
the
cottage
what
had
become
of
simon
ford
his
wife
his
son
and
the
engineer
the
prolonged
absence
of
james
starr
proved
that
he
had
not
left
the
pit
since
the
day
ryan
met
with
him
in
the
shaft
how
had
the
cottage
been
provisioned
since
then
the
food
of
these
unfortunate
people
imprisoned
fifteen
hundred
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
must
have
been
exhausted
by
this
time
all
this
passed
through
jack
s
mind
as
he
saw
that
by
himself
he
could
do
nothing
to
get
to
the
cottage
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
communication
had
been
interrupted
with
a
malevolent
intention
at
any
rate
the
authorities
must
be
informed
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
jack
ryan
bent
forward
from
the
landing
harry
harry
he
shouted
with
his
powerful
voice
harry
s
name
echoed
and
among
the
rocks
and
finally
died
away
in
the
depths
of
the
shaft
ryan
rapidly
ascended
the
upper
ladders
and
returned
to
the
light
of
day
without
losing
a
moment
he
reached
the
callander
station
just
caught
the
express
to
edinburgh
and
by
three
o
clock
was
before
the
lord
provost
there
his
declaration
was
received
his
account
was
given
so
clearly
that
it
could
not
be
doubted
sir
william
elphiston
president
of
the
royal
institution
and
not
only
colleague
but
a
personal
friend
of
starr
s
was
also
informed
and
asked
to
direct
the
search
which
was
to
be
made
without
delay
in
the
mine
several
men
were
placed
at
his
disposal
supplied
with
lamps
picks
long
rope
ladders
not
forgetting
provisions
and
cordials
then
guided
by
jack
ryan
the
party
set
out
for
the
aberfoyle
mines
the
same
evening
the
expedition
arrived
at
the
opening
of
the
yarrow
shaft
and
descended
to
the
landing
at
which
jack
ryan
had
been
stopped
a
few
hours
previously
the
lamps
fastened
to
long
ropes
were
lowered
down
the
shaft
and
it
was
thus
ascertained
that
the
four
last
ladders
were
wanting
as
soon
as
the
lamps
had
been
brought
up
the
men
fixed
to
the
landing
a
rope
ladder
which
unrolled
itself
down
the
shaft
and
all
descended
one
after
the
other
jack
ryan
s
descent
was
the
most
difficult
for
he
went
first
down
the
swinging
ladders
and
fastened
them
for
the
others
the
space
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
was
completely
deserted
but
sir
william
was
much
surprised
at
hearing
jack
ryan
exclaim
here
are
bits
of
the
ladders
and
some
of
them
half
burnt
burnt
repeated
sir
william
indeed
here
sure
enough
are
cinders
which
have
evidently
been
cold
a
long
time
do
you
think
sir
asked
ryan
that
starr
could
have
had
any
reason
for
burning
the
ladders
and
thus
breaking
of
communication
with
the
world
certainly
not
answered
sir
william
elphiston
who
had
become
very
thoughtful
come
my
lad
lead
us
to
the
cottage
there
we
shall
ascertain
the
jack
ryan
shook
his
head
as
if
not
at
all
convinced
then
taking
a
lamp
from
the
hands
of
one
of
the
men
he
proceeded
with
a
rapid
step
along
the
principal
passage
of
the
dochart
pit
the
others
all
followed
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
party
arrived
at
the
excavation
in
which
stood
simon
ford
s
cottage
there
was
no
light
in
the
window
ryan
darted
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
the
house
was
empty
they
examined
all
the
rooms
in
the
somber
habitation
no
trace
of
violence
was
to
be
found
all
was
in
order
as
if
old
madge
had
been
still
there
there
was
even
an
ample
supply
of
provisions
enough
to
last
the
ford
family
for
several
days
the
absence
of
the
tenants
of
the
cottage
was
quite
unaccountable
but
was
it
not
possible
to
find
out
the
exact
time
they
had
quitted
it
yes
for
in
this
region
where
there
was
no
difference
of
day
or
night
madge
was
accustomed
to
mark
with
a
cross
each
day
in
her
almanac
the
almanac
was
pinned
up
on
the
wall
and
there
the
last
cross
had
been
made
at
the
of
december
that
is
to
say
a
day
after
the
arrival
of
james
starr
to
which
ryan
could
positively
swear
it
was
clear
that
on
the
of
december
ten
days
ago
simon
ford
his
wife
son
and
guest
had
quitted
the
cottage
could
a
fresh
exploration
of
the
mine
undertaken
by
the
engineer
account
for
such
a
long
absence
certainly
not
it
was
intensely
dark
all
round
the
lamps
held
by
the
men
gave
light
only
just
where
they
were
standing
suddenly
jack
ryan
uttered
a
cry
look
there
there
his
finger
was
pointing
to
a
tolerably
bright
light
which
was
moving
about
in
the
distance
after
that
light
my
men
exclaimed
sir
william
it
s
a
goblin
light
said
ryan
so
what
s
the
use
we
shall
never
catch
the
president
and
his
men
little
given
to
superstition
darted
off
in
the
direction
of
the
moving
light
jack
ryan
bravely
following
their
example
quickly
overtook
the
of
the
party
it
was
a
long
and
fatiguing
chase
the
lantern
seemed
to
be
carried
by
a
being
of
small
size
but
singular
agility
every
now
and
then
it
disappeared
behind
some
pillar
then
was
seen
again
at
the
end
of
a
cross
gallery
a
sharp
turn
would
place
it
out
of
sight
and
it
seemed
to
have
completely
disappeared
when
all
at
once
there
would
be
the
light
as
bright
as
ever
however
they
gained
very
little
on
it
and
ryan
s
belief
that
they
could
never
catch
it
seemed
far
from
groundless
after
an
hour
of
this
vain
pursuit
sir
william
elphiston
and
his
companions
had
gone
a
long
way
in
the
southwest
direction
of
the
pit
and
began
to
think
they
really
had
to
do
with
an
impalpable
being
just
then
it
seemed
as
if
the
distance
between
the
goblin
and
those
who
were
pursuing
it
was
becoming
less
could
it
be
fatigued
or
did
this
invisible
being
wish
to
entice
sir
william
and
his
companions
to
the
place
where
the
inhabitants
of
the
cottage
had
perhaps
themselves
been
enticed
it
was
hard
to
say
the
men
seeing
that
the
distance
lessened
redoubled
their
efforts
the
light
which
had
before
burnt
at
a
distance
of
more
than
two
hundred
feet
before
them
was
now
seen
at
less
than
fifty
the
space
continued
to
diminish
the
bearer
of
the
lamp
became
partially
visible
sometimes
when
it
turned
its
head
the
indistinct
profile
of
a
human
face
could
be
made
out
and
unless
a
sprite
could
assume
bodily
shape
jack
ryan
was
obliged
to
confess
that
here
was
no
supernatural
being
then
springing
forward
courage
comrades
he
exclaimed
it
is
getting
tired
we
shall
soon
catch
it
up
now
and
if
it
can
talk
as
well
as
it
can
run
we
shall
hear
a
fine
but
the
pursuit
had
suddenly
become
more
difficult
they
were
in
unknown
regions
of
the
mine
narrow
passages
crossed
each
other
like
the
windings
of
a
labyrinth
the
bearer
of
the
lamp
might
escape
them
as
easily
as
possible
by
just
extinguishing
the
light
and
retreating
into
some
dark
refuge
and
indeed
thought
sir
william
if
it
wishes
to
avoid
us
why
does
it
not
do
so
hitherto
there
had
evidently
been
no
intention
to
avoid
them
but
just
as
the
thought
crossed
sir
william
s
mind
the
light
suddenly
disappeared
and
the
party
continuing
the
pursuit
found
themselves
before
an
extremely
narrow
natural
opening
in
the
schistous
rocks
to
trim
their
lamps
spring
forward
and
dart
through
the
opening
was
for
sir
william
and
his
party
but
the
work
of
an
instant
but
before
they
had
gone
a
hundred
paces
along
this
new
gallery
much
wider
and
loftier
than
the
former
they
all
stopped
short
there
near
the
wall
lay
four
bodies
stretched
on
the
ground
four
corpses
perhaps
james
starr
exclaimed
sir
william
elphiston
harry
harry
cried
ryan
throwing
himself
down
beside
his
friend
it
was
indeed
the
engineer
madge
simon
and
harry
ford
who
were
lying
there
motionless
but
one
of
the
bodies
moved
slightly
and
madge
s
voice
was
heard
faintly
murmuring
see
to
the
others
help
them
first
sir
william
jack
and
their
companions
endeavored
to
reanimate
the
engineer
and
his
friends
by
getting
them
to
swallow
a
few
drops
of
brandy
they
very
soon
succeeded
the
unfortunate
people
shut
up
in
that
dark
cavern
for
ten
days
were
dying
of
starvation
they
must
have
perished
had
they
not
on
three
occasions
found
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
jug
of
water
set
near
them
no
doubt
the
charitable
being
to
whom
they
owed
their
lives
was
unable
to
do
more
for
them
sir
william
wondered
whether
this
might
not
have
been
the
work
of
the
strange
sprite
who
had
allured
them
to
the
very
spot
where
james
starr
and
his
companions
lay
however
that
might
be
the
engineer
madge
simon
and
harry
ford
were
saved
they
were
assisted
to
the
cottage
passing
through
the
narrow
opening
which
the
bearer
of
the
strange
light
had
apparently
wished
to
point
out
to
sir
william
this
was
a
natural
opening
the
passage
which
james
starr
and
his
companions
had
made
for
themselves
with
dynamite
had
been
completely
blocked
up
with
rocks
laid
one
upon
another
so
then
whilst
they
had
been
exploring
the
vast
cavern
the
way
back
had
been
purposely
closed
against
them
by
a
hostile
hand

recommended
as
a
great
attraction
to
the
numerous
tourists
who
roam
over
the
county
of
stirling
a
visit
of
a
few
hours
to
the
mines
of
new
aberfoyle
no
mine
in
any
country
either
in
the
old
or
new
world
could
present
a
more
curious
aspect
to
begin
with
the
visitor
was
transported
without
danger
or
fatigue
to
a
level
with
the
workings
at
fifteen
hundred
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
seven
miles
to
the
southwest
of
callander
opened
a
slanting
tunnel
adorned
with
a
castellated
entrance
turrets
and
battlements
this
lofty
tunnel
gently
sloped
straight
to
the
stupendous
crypt
hollowed
out
so
strangely
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
a
double
line
of
railway
the
wagons
being
moved
by
hydraulic
power
plied
from
hour
to
hour
to
and
from
the
village
thus
buried
in
the
subsoil
of
the
county
and
which
bore
the
rather
ambitious
title
of
coal
town
arrived
in
coal
town
the
visitor
found
himself
in
a
place
where
electricity
played
a
principal
part
as
an
agent
of
heat
and
light
although
the
ventilation
shafts
were
numerous
they
were
not
sufficient
to
admit
much
daylight
into
new
aberfoyle
yet
it
had
abundance
of
light
this
was
shed
from
numbers
of
electric
discs
some
suspended
from
the
vaulted
roofs
others
hanging
on
the
natural
pillars
all
whether
suns
or
stars
in
size
were
fed
by
continuous
currents
produced
from
machines
when
the
hour
of
rest
arrived
an
artificial
night
was
easily
produced
all
over
the
mine
by
disconnecting
the
wires
below
the
dome
lay
a
lake
of
an
extent
to
be
compared
to
the
dead
sea
of
the
mammoth
caves
a
deep
lake
whose
transparent
waters
swarmed
with
eyeless
fish
and
to
which
the
engineer
gave
the
name
of
loch
malcolm
there
in
this
immense
natural
excavation
simon
ford
built
his
new
cottage
which
he
would
not
have
exchanged
for
the
finest
house
in
prince
s
street
edinburgh
this
dwelling
was
situated
on
the
shores
of
the
loch
and
its
five
windows
looked
out
on
the
dark
waters
which
extended
further
than
the
eye
could
see
two
months
later
a
second
habitation
was
erected
in
the
neighborhood
of
simon
ford
s
cottage
this
was
for
james
starr
the
engineer
had
given
himself
body
and
soul
to
new
aberfoyle
and
nothing
but
the
most
imperative
necessity
ever
caused
him
to
leave
the
pit
there
then
he
lived
in
the
midst
of
his
mining
world
on
the
discovery
of
the
new
field
all
the
old
colliers
had
hastened
to
leave
the
plow
and
harrow
and
resume
the
pick
and
mattock
attracted
by
the
certainty
that
work
would
never
fail
allured
by
the
high
wages
which
the
prosperity
of
the
mine
enabled
the
company
to
offer
for
labor
they
deserted
the
open
air
for
an
underground
life
and
took
up
their
abode
in
the
mines
the
miners
houses
built
of
brick
soon
grew
up
in
a
picturesque
fashion
some
on
the
banks
of
loch
malcolm
others
under
the
arches
which
seemed
made
to
resist
the
weight
that
pressed
upon
them
like
the
piers
of
a
bridge
so
was
founded
coal
town
situated
under
the
eastern
point
of
loch
katrine
to
the
north
of
the
county
of
stirling
it
was
a
regular
settlement
on
the
banks
of
loch
malcolm
a
chapel
dedicated
to
giles
overlooked
it
from
the
top
of
a
huge
rock
whose
foot
was
laved
by
the
waters
of
the
subterranean
sea
when
this
underground
town
was
lighted
up
by
the
bright
rays
thrown
from
the
discs
hung
from
the
pillars
and
arches
its
aspect
was
so
strange
so
fantastic
that
it
justified
the
praise
of
the
and
visitors
flocked
to
see
it
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
inhabitants
of
coal
town
were
proud
of
their
place
they
rarely
left
their
laboring
village
in
that
imitating
simon
ford
who
never
wished
to
go
out
again
the
old
overman
maintained
that
it
always
rained
up
there
and
considering
the
climate
of
the
united
kingdom
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
was
not
far
wrong
all
the
families
in
new
aberfoyle
prospered
well
having
in
three
years
obtained
a
certain
competency
which
they
could
never
have
hoped
to
attain
on
the
surface
of
the
county
dozens
of
babies
who
were
born
at
the
time
when
the
works
were
resumed
had
never
yet
breathed
the
outer
air
this
made
jack
ryan
remark
it
s
eighteen
months
since
they
were
weaned
and
they
have
not
yet
seen
daylight
it
may
be
mentioned
here
that
one
of
the
first
to
run
at
the
engineer
s
call
was
jack
ryan
the
merry
fellow
had
thought
it
his
duty
to
return
to
his
old
trade
but
though
melrose
farm
had
lost
singer
and
piper
it
must
not
be
thought
that
jack
ryan
sung
no
more
on
the
contrary
the
sonorous
echoes
of
new
aberfoyle
exerted
their
strong
lungs
to
answer
him
jack
ryan
took
up
his
abode
in
simon
ford
s
new
cottage
they
offered
him
a
room
which
he
accepted
without
ceremony
in
his
frank
and
hearty
way
old
madge
loved
him
for
his
fine
character
and
good
nature
she
in
some
degree
shared
his
ideas
on
the
subject
of
the
fantastic
beings
who
were
supposed
to
haunt
the
mine
and
the
two
when
alone
told
each
other
stories
wild
enough
to
make
one
shudder
stories
well
worthy
of
enriching
the
hyperborean
mythology
jack
thus
became
the
life
of
the
cottage
he
was
besides
being
a
jovial
companion
a
good
workman
six
months
after
the
works
had
begun
he
was
made
head
of
a
gang
of
hewers
that
was
a
good
work
done
ford
said
he
a
few
days
after
his
appointment
you
discovered
a
new
field
and
though
you
narrowly
escaped
paying
for
the
discovery
with
your
life
well
it
was
not
too
dearly
no
jack
it
was
a
good
bargain
we
made
that
time
answered
the
old
overman
but
neither
starr
nor
i
have
forgotten
that
to
you
we
owe
our
not
at
all
returned
jack
you
owe
them
to
your
son
harry
when
he
had
the
good
sense
to
accept
my
invitation
to
and
not
to
go
isn
t
that
it
interrupted
harry
grasping
his
comrade
s
hand
no
jack
it
is
to
you
scarcely
healed
of
your
wounds
to
you
who
did
not
delay
a
day
no
nor
an
hour
that
we
owe
our
being
found
still
alive
in
the
mine
rubbish
no
broke
in
the
obstinate
fellow
i
won
t
have
that
said
when
it
s
no
such
thing
i
hurried
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
you
harry
that
s
all
but
to
give
everyone
his
due
i
will
add
that
without
that
unapproachable
goblin
ah
there
we
are
cried
ford
a
goblin
a
goblin
a
brownie
a
fairy
s
child
repeated
jack
ryan
a
cousin
of
the
an
urisk
whatever
you
like
it
s
not
the
less
certain
that
without
it
we
should
never
have
found
our
way
into
the
gallery
from
which
you
could
not
get
no
doubt
jack
answered
harry
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
this
being
was
as
supernatural
as
you
choose
to
supernatural
exclaimed
ryan
but
it
was
as
supernatural
as
a
who
may
be
seen
skipping
along
with
his
lantern
in
his
hand
you
may
try
to
catch
him
but
he
escapes
like
a
fairy
and
vanishes
like
a
shadow
don
t
be
uneasy
harry
we
shall
see
it
again
some
day
or
other
well
jack
said
simon
ford
or
not
we
shall
try
to
find
it
and
you
must
help
you
ll
get
into
a
scrap
if
you
don
t
take
care
ford
responded
jack
ryan
we
ll
see
about
that
jack
we
may
easily
imagine
how
soon
this
domain
of
new
aberfoyle
became
familiar
to
all
the
members
of
the
ford
family
but
more
particularly
to
harry
he
learnt
to
know
all
its
most
secret
ins
and
outs
he
could
even
say
what
point
of
the
surface
corresponded
with
what
point
of
the
mine
he
knew
that
above
this
seam
lay
the
firth
of
clyde
that
there
extended
loch
lomond
and
loch
katrine
those
columns
supported
a
spur
of
the
grampian
mountains
this
vault
served
as
a
basement
to
dumbarton
above
this
large
pond
passed
the
balloch
railway
here
ended
the
scottish
coast
there
began
the
sea
the
tumult
of
which
could
be
distinctly
heard
during
the
equinoctial
gales
harry
would
have
been
a
guide
to
these
natural
catacombs
and
all
that
alpine
guides
do
on
their
snowy
peaks
in
daylight
he
could
have
done
in
the
dark
mine
by
the
wonderful
power
of
instinct
he
loved
new
aberfoyle
many
times
with
his
lamp
stuck
in
his
hat
did
he
penetrate
its
furthest
depths
he
explored
its
ponds
in
a
canoe
he
even
went
shooting
for
numerous
birds
had
been
introduced
into
the
crypt
pintails
snipes
ducks
who
fed
on
the
fish
which
swarmed
in
the
deep
waters
harry
s
eyes
seemed
made
for
the
dark
just
as
a
sailor
s
are
made
for
distances
but
all
this
while
harry
felt
irresistibly
animated
by
the
hope
of
finding
the
mysterious
being
whose
intervention
strictly
speaking
had
saved
himself
and
his
friends
would
he
succeed
he
certainly
would
if
presentiments
were
to
be
trusted
but
certainly
not
if
he
judged
by
the
success
which
had
as
yet
attended
his
researches
the
attacks
directed
against
the
family
of
the
old
overman
before
the
discovery
of
new
aberfoyle
had
not
been
renewed
chapter
xi
hanging
by
a
thread
although
in
this
way
the
ford
family
led
a
happy
and
contented
life
yet
it
was
easy
to
see
that
harry
naturally
of
a
grave
disposition
became
more
and
more
quiet
and
reserved
even
jack
ryan
with
all
his
good
humor
and
usually
infectious
merriment
failed
to
rouse
him
to
gayety
of
manner
one
sunday
it
was
in
the
month
of
june
the
two
friends
were
walking
together
on
the
shores
of
loch
malcolm
coal
town
rested
from
labor
in
the
world
above
stormy
weather
prevailed
violent
rains
fell
and
dull
sultry
vapors
brooded
over
the
earth
the
atmosphere
was
most
oppressive
down
in
coal
town
there
was
perfect
calm
no
wind
no
rain
a
soft
and
pleasant
temperature
existed
instead
of
the
strife
of
the
elements
which
raged
without
what
wonder
then
that
excursionists
from
stirling
came
in
considerable
numbers
to
enjoy
the
calm
fresh
air
in
the
recesses
of
the
mine
the
electric
discs
shed
a
brilliancy
of
light
which
the
british
sun
oftener
obscured
by
fogs
than
it
ought
to
be
might
well
envy
jack
ryan
kept
talking
of
these
visitors
who
passed
them
in
noisy
crowds
but
harry
paid
very
little
attention
to
what
he
said
i
say
do
look
harry
cried
jack
see
what
numbers
of
people
come
to
visit
us
cheer
up
old
fellow
do
the
honors
of
the
place
a
little
better
if
you
look
so
glum
you
ll
make
all
these
outside
folks
think
you
envy
their
life
never
mind
me
jack
answered
harry
you
are
jolly
enough
for
two
i
m
sure
that
s
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
don
t
feel
your
melancholy
creeping
over
me
though
exclaimed
jack
i
declare
my
eyes
are
getting
quite
dull
my
lips
are
drawn
together
my
laugh
sticks
in
my
throat
i
m
forgetting
all
my
songs
come
man
what
s
the
matter
with
you
you
know
well
enough
what
the
old
story
yes
the
same
thoughts
haunt
ah
poor
fellow
said
jack
shrugging
his
shoulders
if
you
would
only
do
like
me
and
set
all
the
queer
things
down
to
the
account
of
the
goblins
of
the
mine
you
would
be
easier
in
your
but
jack
you
know
very
well
that
these
goblins
exist
only
in
your
imagination
and
that
since
the
works
here
have
been
reopened
not
a
single
one
has
been
that
s
true
harry
but
if
no
spirits
have
been
seen
neither
has
anyone
else
to
whom
you
could
attribute
the
extraordinary
doings
we
want
to
account
i
shall
discover
ah
harry
harry
it
s
not
so
easy
to
catch
the
spirits
of
new
aberfoyle
i
shall
find
out
the
spirits
as
you
call
them
said
harry
in
a
tone
of
firm
conviction
do
you
expect
to
be
able
to
punish
them
both
punish
and
reward
remember
if
one
hand
shut
us
up
in
that
passage
another
hand
delivered
us
i
shall
not
soon
forget
but
harry
how
can
we
be
sure
that
these
two
hands
do
not
belong
to
the
same
body
what
can
put
such
a
notion
in
your
head
jack
asked
harry
well
i
don
t
know
creatures
that
live
in
these
holes
harry
don
t
you
see
they
can
t
be
made
like
us
eh
but
they
are
just
like
us
oh
no
don
t
say
that
harry
perhaps
some
madman
managed
to
get
in
for
a
a
madman
no
madman
would
have
formed
such
connected
plans
or
done
such
continued
mischief
as
befell
us
after
the
breaking
of
the
well
but
anyhow
he
has
done
no
harm
for
the
last
three
years
either
to
you
harry
or
any
of
your
no
matter
jack
replied
harry
i
am
persuaded
that
this
malignant
being
whoever
he
is
has
by
no
means
given
up
his
evil
intentions
i
can
hardly
say
on
what
i
found
my
convictions
but
at
any
rate
for
the
sake
of
the
new
works
i
must
and
will
know
who
he
is
and
whence
he
for
the
sake
of
the
new
works
did
you
say
asked
jack
considerably
surprised
i
said
so
jack
returned
harry
i
may
be
mistaken
but
to
me
all
that
has
happened
proves
the
existence
of
an
interest
in
this
mine
in
strong
opposition
to
ours
many
a
time
have
i
considered
the
matter
i
feel
almost
sure
of
it
just
consider
the
whole
series
of
inexplicable
circumstances
so
singularly
linked
together
to
begin
with
the
anonymous
letter
contradictory
to
that
of
my
father
at
once
proves
that
some
man
had
become
aware
of
our
projects
and
wished
to
prevent
their
accomplishment
starr
comes
to
see
us
at
the
dochart
pit
no
sooner
does
he
enter
it
with
me
than
an
immense
stone
is
cast
upon
us
and
communication
is
interrupted
by
the
breaking
of
the
ladders
in
the
yarrow
shaft
we
commence
exploring
an
experiment
by
which
the
existence
of
a
new
vein
would
be
proved
is
rendered
impossible
by
stoppage
of
fissures
notwithstanding
this
the
examination
is
carried
out
the
vein
discovered
we
return
as
we
came
a
prodigious
gust
of
air
meets
us
our
lamp
is
broken
utter
darkness
surrounds
us
nevertheless
we
make
our
way
along
the
gloomy
passage
until
on
reaching
the
entrance
we
find
it
blocked
up
there
we
were
imprisoned
now
jack
don
t
you
see
in
all
these
things
a
malicious
intention
ah
yes
believe
me
some
being
hitherto
invisible
but
not
supernatural
as
you
will
persist
in
thinking
was
concealed
in
the
mine
for
some
reason
known
only
to
himself
he
strove
to
keep
us
out
of
it
was
there
did
i
say
i
feel
an
inward
conviction
that
he
is
there
still
and
probably
prepares
some
terrible
disaster
for
us
even
at
the
risk
of
my
life
jack
i
am
resolved
to
discover
harry
spoke
with
an
earnestness
which
strongly
impressed
his
companion
well
harry
said
he
if
i
am
forced
to
agree
with
you
in
certain
points
won
t
you
admit
that
some
kind
fairy
or
brownie
by
bringing
bread
and
water
to
you
was
the
means
of
jack
my
friend
interrupted
harry
it
is
my
belief
that
the
friendly
person
whom
you
will
persist
in
calling
a
spirit
exists
in
the
mine
as
certainly
as
the
criminal
we
speak
of
and
i
mean
to
seek
them
both
in
the
most
distant
recesses
of
the
but
inquired
jack
have
you
any
possible
clew
to
guide
your
search
perhaps
i
have
listen
to
me
five
miles
west
of
new
aberfoyle
under
the
solid
rock
which
supports
ben
lomond
there
exists
a
natural
shaft
which
descends
perpendicularly
into
the
vein
beneath
a
week
ago
i
went
to
ascertain
the
depth
of
this
shaft
while
sounding
it
and
bending
over
the
opening
as
my
went
down
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
air
within
was
agitated
as
though
beaten
by
huge
some
bird
must
have
got
lost
among
the
lower
galleries
replied
jack
but
that
is
not
all
jack
this
very
morning
i
went
back
to
the
place
and
listening
attentively
i
thought
i
could
detect
a
sound
like
a
sort
of
groaning
cried
jack
that
must
be
nonsense
it
was
a
current
of
air
unless
indeed
some
ghost
i
shall
know
what
it
was
said
harry
answered
jack
looking
at
his
friend
yes
i
am
going
down
into
that
harry
that
will
be
a
tempting
of
no
jack
providence
will
aid
me
in
the
attempt
tomorrow
you
and
some
of
our
comrades
will
go
with
me
to
that
shaft
i
will
fasten
myself
to
a
long
rope
by
which
you
can
let
me
down
and
draw
me
up
at
a
given
signal
i
may
depend
upon
you
jack
well
harry
said
jack
shaking
his
head
i
will
do
as
you
wish
me
but
i
tell
you
all
the
same
you
are
very
nothing
venture
nothing
win
said
harry
in
a
tone
of
decision
morning
then
at
six
o
clock
be
silent
and
farewell
it
must
be
admitted
that
jack
ryan
s
fears
were
far
from
groundless
harry
would
expose
himself
to
very
great
danger
supposing
the
enemy
he
sought
for
lay
concealed
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
into
which
he
was
going
to
descend
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
such
was
the
case
however
why
in
the
world
repeated
jack
ryan
should
he
take
all
this
trouble
to
account
for
a
set
of
facts
so
very
easily
and
simply
explained
by
the
supernatural
intervention
of
the
spirits
of
the
mine
but
notwithstanding
his
objections
to
the
scheme
jack
ryan
and
three
miners
of
his
gang
arrived
next
morning
with
harry
at
the
mouth
of
the
opening
of
the
suspicious
shaft
harry
had
not
mentioned
his
intentions
either
to
james
starr
or
to
the
old
overman
jack
had
been
discreet
enough
to
say
nothing
harry
had
provided
himself
with
a
rope
about
feet
long
it
was
not
particularly
thick
but
very
strong
sufficiently
so
to
sustain
his
weight
his
friends
were
to
let
him
down
into
the
gulf
and
his
pulling
the
cord
was
to
be
the
signal
to
withdraw
him
the
opening
into
this
shaft
or
well
was
twelve
feet
wide
a
beam
was
thrown
across
like
a
bridge
so
that
the
cord
passing
over
it
should
hang
down
the
center
of
the
opening
and
save
harry
from
striking
against
the
sides
in
his
descent
he
was
ready
are
you
still
determined
to
explore
this
abyss
whispered
jack
ryan
yes
i
am
the
cord
was
fastened
round
harry
s
thighs
and
under
his
arms
to
keep
him
from
rocking
thus
supported
he
was
free
to
use
both
his
hands
a
hung
at
his
belt
also
a
large
strong
knife
in
a
leather
sheath
harry
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
beam
around
which
the
cord
was
passed
then
his
friends
began
to
let
him
down
and
he
slowly
sank
into
the
pit
as
the
rope
caused
him
to
swing
gently
round
and
round
the
light
of
his
lamp
fell
in
turns
on
all
points
of
the
side
walls
so
that
he
was
able
to
examine
them
carefully
these
walls
consisted
of
pit
coal
and
so
smooth
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
ascend
them
harry
calculated
that
he
was
going
down
at
the
rate
of
about
a
foot
per
second
so
that
he
had
time
to
look
about
him
and
be
ready
for
any
event
during
two
minutes
that
is
to
say
to
the
depth
of
about
feet
the
descent
continued
without
any
incident
no
lateral
gallery
opened
from
the
side
walls
of
the
pit
which
was
gradually
narrowing
into
the
shape
of
a
funnel
but
harry
began
to
feel
a
fresher
air
rising
from
beneath
whence
he
concluded
that
the
bottom
of
the
pit
communicated
with
a
gallery
of
some
description
in
the
lowest
part
of
the
mine
the
cord
continued
to
unwind
darkness
and
silence
were
complete
if
any
living
being
whatever
had
sought
refuge
in
the
deep
and
mysterious
abyss
he
had
either
left
it
or
if
there
by
no
movement
did
he
in
the
slightest
way
betray
his
presence
harry
becoming
more
suspicious
the
lower
he
got
now
drew
his
knife
and
held
it
in
his
right
hand
at
a
depth
of
feet
his
feet
touched
the
lower
point
and
the
cord
slackened
and
unwound
no
further
harry
breathed
more
freely
for
a
moment
one
of
the
fears
he
entertained
had
been
that
during
his
descent
the
cord
might
be
cut
above
him
but
he
had
seen
no
projection
from
the
walls
behind
which
anyone
could
have
been
concealed
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
was
quite
dry
harry
taking
the
lamp
from
his
belt
walked
round
the
place
and
perceived
he
had
been
right
in
his
conjectures
an
extremely
narrow
passage
led
aside
out
of
the
pit
he
had
to
stoop
to
look
into
it
and
only
by
creeping
could
it
be
followed
but
as
he
wanted
to
see
in
which
direction
it
led
and
whether
another
abyss
opened
from
it
he
lay
down
on
the
ground
and
began
to
enter
it
on
hands
and
knees
an
obstacle
speedily
arrested
his
progress
he
fancied
he
could
perceive
by
touching
it
that
a
human
body
lay
across
the
passage
a
sudden
thrill
of
horror
and
surprise
made
him
hastily
draw
back
but
he
again
advanced
and
felt
more
carefully
his
senses
had
not
deceived
him
a
body
did
indeed
lie
there
and
he
soon
ascertained
that
although
icy
cold
at
the
extremities
there
was
some
vital
heat
remaining
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
harry
had
drawn
the
body
from
the
recess
to
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
and
seizing
his
lamp
he
cast
its
lights
on
what
he
had
found
exclaiming
immediately
why
it
is
a
child
the
child
still
breathed
but
so
very
feebly
that
harry
expected
it
to
cease
every
instant
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
he
must
carry
this
poor
little
creature
out
of
the
pit
and
take
it
home
to
his
mother
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
eagerly
fastened
the
cord
round
his
waist
stuck
on
his
lamp
clasped
the
child
to
his
breast
with
his
left
arm
and
keeping
his
right
hand
free
to
hold
the
knife
he
gave
the
signal
agreed
on
to
have
the
rope
pulled
up
it
tightened
at
once
he
began
the
ascent
harry
looked
around
him
with
redoubled
care
for
more
than
his
own
life
was
now
in
danger
for
a
few
minutes
all
went
well
no
accident
seemed
to
threaten
him
when
suddenly
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
great
rush
of
air
from
beneath
and
looking
down
he
could
dimly
perceive
through
the
gloom
a
broad
mass
arising
until
it
passed
him
striking
him
as
it
went
by
it
was
an
enormous
bird
of
what
sort
he
could
not
see
it
flew
upwards
on
mighty
wings
then
paused
hovered
and
dashed
fiercely
down
upon
harry
who
could
only
wield
his
knife
in
one
hand
he
defended
himself
and
the
child
as
well
as
he
could
but
the
ferocious
bird
seemed
to
aim
all
its
blows
at
him
alone
afraid
of
cutting
the
cord
he
could
not
strike
it
as
he
wished
and
the
struggle
was
prolonged
while
harry
shouted
with
all
his
might
in
hopes
of
making
his
comrades
hear
he
soon
knew
they
did
for
they
pulled
the
rope
up
faster
a
distance
of
about
eighty
feet
remained
to
be
got
over
the
bird
ceased
its
direct
attack
but
increased
the
horror
and
danger
of
his
situation
by
rushing
at
the
cord
clinging
to
it
just
out
of
his
reach
and
endeavoring
by
pecking
furiously
to
cut
it
harry
felt
overcome
with
terrible
dread
one
strand
of
the
rope
gave
way
and
it
made
them
sink
a
little
a
shriek
of
despair
escaped
his
lips
a
second
strand
was
divided
and
the
double
burden
now
hung
suspended
by
only
half
the
cord
harry
dropped
his
knife
and
by
a
superhuman
effort
succeeded
at
the
moment
the
rope
was
giving
way
in
catching
hold
of
it
with
his
right
hand
above
the
cut
made
by
the
beak
of
the
bird
but
powerfully
as
he
held
it
in
his
iron
grasp
he
could
feel
it
gradually
slipping
through
his
fingers
he
might
have
caught
it
and
held
on
with
both
hands
by
sacrificing
the
life
of
the
child
he
supported
in
his
left
arm
the
idea
crossed
him
but
was
banished
in
an
instant
although
he
believed
himself
quite
unable
to
hold
out
until
drawn
to
the
surface
for
a
second
he
closed
his
eyes
believing
they
were
about
to
plunge
back
into
the
abyss
he
looked
up
once
more
the
huge
bird
had
disappeared
his
hand
was
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
broken
rope
when
just
as
his
convulsive
grasp
was
failing
he
was
seized
by
the
men
and
with
the
child
was
placed
on
the
level
ground
the
fearful
strain
of
anxiety
removed
a
reaction
took
place
and
harry
fell
fainting
into
the
arms
of
his
friends
chapter
xii
nell
adopted
a
couple
of
hours
later
harry
still
unconscious
and
the
child
in
a
very
feeble
state
were
brought
to
the
cottage
by
jack
ryan
and
his
companions
the
old
overman
listened
to
the
account
of
their
adventures
while
madge
attended
with
the
utmost
care
to
the
wants
of
her
son
and
of
the
poor
creature
whom
he
had
rescued
from
the
pit
harry
imagined
her
a
mere
child
but
she
was
a
maiden
of
the
age
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
she
gazed
at
them
with
vague
and
wondering
eyes
and
the
thin
face
drawn
by
suffering
the
pallid
complexion
which
light
could
never
have
tinged
and
the
fragile
slender
figure
gave
her
an
appearance
at
once
singular
and
attractive
jack
ryan
declared
that
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
an
uncommonly
interesting
kind
of
ghost
it
must
have
been
due
to
the
strange
and
peculiar
circumstances
under
which
her
life
hitherto
had
been
led
that
she
scarcely
seemed
to
belong
to
the
human
race
her
countenance
was
of
a
very
uncommon
cast
and
her
eyes
hardly
able
to
bear
the
in
the
cottage
glanced
around
in
a
confused
and
puzzled
way
as
if
all
were
new
to
them
as
this
singular
being
reclined
on
madge
s
bed
and
awoke
to
consciousness
as
from
a
long
sleep
the
old
scotchwoman
began
to
question
her
a
little
what
do
they
call
you
my
dear
said
she
nell
replied
the
girl
do
you
feel
anything
the
matter
with
you
nell
i
am
hungry
i
have
eaten
nothing
since
since
nell
uttered
these
few
words
like
one
unused
to
speak
much
they
were
in
the
gaelic
language
which
was
often
spoken
by
simon
and
his
family
madge
immediately
brought
her
some
food
she
was
evidently
famished
it
was
impossible
to
say
how
long
she
might
have
been
in
that
pit
how
many
days
had
you
been
down
there
dearie
inquired
madge
nell
made
no
answer
she
seemed
not
to
understand
the
question
how
many
days
do
you
think
days
repeated
nell
as
though
the
word
had
no
meaning
for
her
and
she
shook
her
head
to
signify
entire
want
of
comprehension
madge
took
her
hand
and
stroked
it
caressingly
how
old
are
you
my
lassie
she
asked
smiling
kindly
at
her
nell
shook
her
head
again
yes
yes
continued
madge
how
many
years
old
years
replied
nell
she
seemed
to
understand
that
word
no
better
than
days
simon
harry
jack
and
the
rest
looked
on
with
an
air
of
mingled
compassion
wonder
and
sympathy
the
state
of
this
poor
thing
clothed
in
a
miserable
garment
of
coarse
woolen
stuff
seemed
to
impress
them
painfully
harry
more
than
all
the
rest
seemed
attracted
by
the
very
peculiarity
of
this
poor
stranger
he
drew
near
took
nell
s
hand
from
his
mother
and
looked
directly
at
her
while
something
like
a
smile
curved
her
lip
nell
he
said
nell
away
down
there
in
the
mine
were
you
all
alone
alone
alone
cried
the
girl
raising
herself
hastily
her
features
expressed
terror
her
eyes
which
had
appeared
to
soften
as
harry
looked
at
her
became
quite
wild
again
alone
repeated
she
alone
and
she
fell
back
on
the
bed
as
though
deprived
of
all
strength
the
poor
bairn
is
too
weak
to
speak
to
us
said
madge
when
she
had
adjusted
the
pillows
after
a
good
rest
and
a
little
more
food
she
will
be
stronger
come
away
simon
and
harry
and
all
the
rest
of
you
and
let
her
go
to
so
nell
was
left
alone
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
slept
profoundly
this
event
caused
a
great
sensation
not
only
in
the
coal
mines
but
in
stirlingshire
and
ultimately
throughout
the
kingdom
the
strangeness
of
the
story
was
exaggerated
the
affair
could
not
have
made
more
commotion
had
they
found
the
girl
enclosed
in
the
solid
rock
like
one
of
those
antediluvian
creatures
who
have
occasionally
been
released
by
a
stroke
of
the
pickax
from
their
stony
prison
nell
became
a
fashionable
wonder
without
knowing
it
superstitious
folks
made
her
story
a
new
subject
for
legendary
marvels
and
were
inclined
to
think
as
jack
ryan
told
harry
that
nell
was
the
spirit
of
the
mines
be
it
so
jack
said
the
young
man
but
at
any
rate
she
is
the
good
spirit
it
can
have
been
none
but
she
who
brought
us
bread
and
water
when
we
were
shut
up
down
there
and
as
to
the
bad
spirit
who
must
still
be
in
the
mine
we
ll
catch
him
some
of
course
james
starr
had
been
at
once
informed
of
all
this
and
came
as
soon
as
the
young
girl
had
sufficiently
recovered
her
strength
to
see
her
and
endeavor
to
question
her
carefully
she
appeared
ignorant
of
nearly
everything
relating
to
life
and
although
evidently
intelligent
was
wanting
in
many
elementary
ideas
such
as
time
for
instance
she
had
never
been
used
to
its
division
and
the
words
signifying
hours
days
months
and
years
were
unknown
to
her
her
eyes
accustomed
to
the
night
were
pained
by
the
glare
of
the
electric
discs
but
in
the
dark
her
sight
was
wonderfully
keen
the
pupil
dilated
in
a
remarkable
manner
and
she
could
see
where
to
others
there
appeared
profound
obscurity
it
was
certain
that
her
brain
had
never
received
any
impression
of
the
outer
world
that
her
eyes
had
never
looked
beyond
the
mine
and
that
these
somber
depths
had
been
all
the
world
to
her
the
poor
girl
probably
knew
not
that
there
were
a
sun
and
stars
towns
and
counties
a
mighty
universe
composed
of
myriads
of
worlds
but
until
she
comprehended
the
significance
of
words
at
present
conveying
no
precise
meaning
to
her
it
was
impossible
to
ascertain
what
she
knew
as
to
whether
or
not
nell
had
lived
alone
in
the
recesses
of
new
aberfoyle
james
starr
was
obliged
to
remain
uncertain
indeed
any
allusion
to
the
subject
excited
evident
alarm
in
the
mind
of
this
strange
girl
either
nell
could
not
or
would
not
reply
to
questions
but
that
some
secret
existed
in
connection
with
the
place
which
she
could
have
explained
was
manifest
should
you
like
to
stay
with
us
should
you
like
to
go
back
to
where
we
found
you
asked
james
starr
oh
yes
exclaimed
the
maiden
in
answer
to
his
first
question
but
a
cry
of
terror
was
all
she
seemed
able
to
say
to
the
second
james
starr
as
well
as
simon
and
harry
ford
could
not
help
feeling
a
certain
amount
of
uneasiness
with
regard
to
this
persistent
silence
they
found
it
impossible
to
forget
all
that
had
appeared
so
inexplicable
at
the
time
they
made
the
discovery
of
the
coal
mine
and
although
that
was
three
years
ago
and
nothing
new
had
happened
they
always
expected
some
fresh
attack
on
the
part
of
the
invisible
enemy
they
resolved
to
explore
the
mysterious
well
and
did
so
well
armed
and
in
considerable
numbers
but
nothing
suspicious
was
to
be
seen
the
shaft
communicated
with
lower
stages
of
the
crypt
hollowed
out
in
the
carboniferous
bed
many
a
time
did
james
starr
simon
and
harry
talk
over
these
things
if
one
or
more
malevolent
beings
were
concealed
in
the
and
there
concocted
mischief
nell
surely
could
have
warned
them
of
it
yet
she
said
nothing
the
slightest
allusion
to
her
past
life
brought
on
such
fits
of
violent
emotion
that
it
was
judged
best
to
avoid
the
subject
for
the
present
her
secret
would
certainly
escape
her
by
the
time
nell
had
been
a
fortnight
in
the
cottage
she
had
become
a
most
intelligent
and
zealous
assistant
to
old
madge
it
was
clear
that
she
instinctively
felt
she
should
remain
in
the
dwelling
where
she
had
been
so
charitably
received
and
perhaps
never
dreamt
of
quitting
it
this
family
was
all
in
all
to
her
and
to
the
good
folks
themselves
nell
had
seemed
an
adopted
child
from
the
moment
when
she
first
came
beneath
their
roof
nell
was
in
truth
a
charming
creature
her
new
mode
of
existence
added
to
her
beauty
for
these
were
no
doubt
the
first
happy
days
of
her
life
and
her
heart
was
full
of
gratitude
towards
those
to
whom
she
owed
them
madge
felt
towards
her
as
a
mother
would
the
old
woman
doted
upon
her
in
short
she
was
beloved
by
everybody
jack
ryan
only
regretted
one
thing
which
was
that
he
had
not
saved
her
himself
friend
jack
often
came
to
the
cottage
he
sang
and
nell
who
had
never
heard
singing
before
admired
it
greatly
but
anyone
might
see
that
she
preferred
to
jack
s
songs
the
graver
conversation
of
harry
from
whom
by
degrees
she
learnt
truths
concerning
the
outer
world
of
which
hitherto
she
had
known
nothing
it
must
be
said
that
since
nell
had
appeared
in
her
own
person
jack
ryan
had
been
obliged
to
admit
that
his
belief
in
hobgoblins
was
in
a
measure
weakened
a
couple
of
months
later
his
credulity
experienced
a
further
shock
about
that
time
harry
unexpectedly
made
a
discovery
which
in
part
at
least
accounted
for
the
apparition
of
the
among
the
ruins
of
dundonald
castle
at
irvine
during
several
days
he
had
been
engaged
in
exploring
the
remote
galleries
of
the
prodigious
excavation
towards
the
south
at
last
he
scrambled
with
difficulty
up
a
narrow
passage
which
branched
off
through
the
upper
rock
to
his
great
astonishment
he
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
open
air
the
passage
after
ascending
obliquely
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
led
out
directly
among
the
ruins
of
dundonald
castle
there
was
therefore
a
communication
between
new
aberfoyle
and
the
hills
crowned
by
this
ancient
castle
the
upper
entrance
to
this
gallery
being
completely
concealed
by
stones
and
brushwood
was
invisible
from
without
at
the
time
of
their
search
therefore
the
magistrates
had
been
able
to
discover
nothing
a
few
days
afterwards
james
starr
guided
by
harry
came
himself
to
inspect
this
curious
natural
opening
into
the
coal
mine
well
said
he
here
is
enough
to
convince
the
most
superstitious
among
us
farewell
to
all
their
brownies
goblins
and
now
i
hardly
think
starr
we
ought
to
congratulate
ourselves
replied
harry
whatever
it
is
we
have
instead
of
these
things
it
can
t
be
better
and
may
be
worse
than
they
that
s
true
harry
said
the
engineer
but
what
s
to
be
done
it
is
plain
that
whatever
the
beings
are
who
hide
in
the
mine
they
reach
the
surface
of
the
earth
by
this
passage
no
doubt
it
was
the
light
of
torches
waved
by
them
during
that
dark
and
stormy
night
which
attracted
the
motala
towards
the
rocky
coast
and
like
the
wreckers
of
former
days
they
would
have
plundered
the
unfortunate
vessel
had
it
not
been
for
jack
ryan
and
his
friends
anyhow
so
far
it
is
evident
and
here
is
the
mouth
of
the
den
as
to
its
occupants
the
question
is
are
they
here
still
i
say
yes
because
nell
trembles
when
we
mention
them
yes
because
nell
will
not
or
dare
not
speak
about
them
answered
harry
in
a
tone
of
decision
harry
was
surely
in
the
right
had
these
mysterious
denizens
of
the
pit
abandoned
it
or
ceased
to
visit
the
spot
what
reason
could
the
girl
have
had
for
keeping
silence
james
starr
could
not
rest
till
he
had
penetrated
this
mystery
he
foresaw
that
the
whole
future
of
the
new
excavations
must
depend
upon
it
renewed
and
strict
precautions
were
therefore
taken
the
authorities
were
informed
of
the
discovery
of
the
entrance
watchers
were
placed
among
the
ruins
of
the
castle
harry
himself
lay
hid
for
several
nights
in
the
thickets
of
brushwood
which
clothed
the
nothing
was
discovered
no
human
being
emerged
from
the
opening
so
most
people
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
villains
had
been
finally
dislodged
from
the
mine
and
that
as
to
nell
they
must
suppose
her
to
be
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
where
they
had
left
her
while
it
remained
unworked
the
mine
had
been
a
safe
enough
place
of
refuge
secure
from
all
search
or
pursuit
but
now
circumstances
being
altered
it
became
difficult
to
conceal
this
and
it
might
reasonably
be
hoped
they
were
gone
and
that
nothing
for
the
future
was
to
be
dreaded
from
them
james
starr
however
could
not
feel
sure
about
it
neither
could
harry
be
satisfied
on
the
subject
often
repeating
nell
has
clearly
been
mixed
up
with
all
this
secret
business
if
she
had
nothing
more
to
fear
why
should
she
keep
silence
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
she
is
happy
with
us
she
likes
us
all
she
adores
my
mother
her
absolute
silence
as
to
her
former
life
when
by
speaking
out
she
might
benefit
us
proves
to
me
that
some
awful
secret
which
she
dares
not
reveal
weighs
on
her
mind
it
may
also
be
that
she
believes
it
better
for
us
as
well
as
for
herself
that
she
should
remain
mute
in
a
way
otherwise
so
in
consequence
of
these
opinions
it
was
agreed
by
common
consent
to
avoid
all
allusion
to
the
maiden
s
former
mode
of
life
one
day
however
harry
was
led
to
make
known
to
nell
what
james
starr
his
father
mother
and
himself
believed
they
owed
to
her
interference
it
was
a
the
miners
made
holiday
on
the
surface
of
the
county
of
stirling
as
well
as
in
its
subterraneous
domains
parties
of
were
moving
about
in
all
directions
songs
resounded
in
many
places
beneath
the
sonorous
vaults
of
new
aberfoyle
harry
and
nell
left
the
cottage
and
slowly
walked
along
the
left
bank
of
loch
malcolm
then
the
electric
brilliance
darted
less
vividly
and
the
rays
were
interrupted
with
fantastic
effect
by
the
sharp
angles
of
the
picturesque
rocks
which
supported
the
dome
this
imperfect
light
suited
nell
to
whose
eyes
a
glare
was
very
unpleasant
nell
said
harry
your
eyes
are
not
fit
for
daylight
yet
and
could
not
bear
the
brightness
of
the
indeed
they
could
not
replied
the
girl
if
the
sun
is
such
as
you
describe
it
to
me
i
can
not
by
any
words
nell
give
you
an
idea
either
of
his
splendor
or
of
the
beauty
of
that
universe
which
your
eyes
have
never
beheld
but
tell
me
is
it
really
possible
that
since
the
day
when
you
were
born
in
the
depths
of
the
coal
mine
you
never
once
have
been
up
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
never
once
harry
said
she
i
do
not
believe
that
even
as
an
infant
my
father
or
mother
ever
carried
me
thither
i
am
sure
i
should
have
retained
some
impression
of
the
open
air
if
they
i
believe
you
would
answered
harry
long
ago
nell
many
children
used
to
live
altogether
in
the
mine
communication
was
then
difficult
and
i
have
met
with
more
than
one
young
person
quite
as
ignorant
as
you
are
of
things
but
now
the
railway
through
our
great
tunnel
takes
us
in
a
few
minutes
to
the
upper
regions
of
our
country
i
long
nell
to
hear
you
say
come
harry
my
eyes
can
bear
daylight
and
i
want
to
see
the
sun
i
want
to
look
upon
the
works
of
the
i
shall
soon
say
so
harry
i
hope
replied
the
girl
i
shall
soon
go
with
you
to
the
world
above
and
yet
what
are
you
going
to
say
nell
hastily
cried
harry
can
you
possibly
regret
having
quitted
that
gloomy
abyss
in
which
you
spent
your
early
years
and
whence
we
drew
you
half
dead
no
harry
answered
nell
i
was
only
thinking
that
darkness
is
beautiful
as
well
as
light
if
you
but
knew
what
eyes
accustomed
to
its
depth
can
see
shades
flit
by
which
one
longs
to
follow
circles
mingle
and
intertwine
and
one
could
gaze
on
them
forever
black
hollows
full
of
indefinite
gleams
of
radiance
lie
deep
at
the
bottom
of
the
mine
and
then
the
sounds
ah
harry
one
must
have
lived
down
there
to
understand
what
i
feel
what
i
can
never
and
were
you
not
afraid
nell
all
alone
there
it
was
just
when
i
was
alone
that
i
was
not
nell
s
voice
altered
slightly
as
she
said
these
words
however
harry
thought
he
might
press
the
subject
a
little
further
so
he
said
but
one
might
be
easily
lost
in
these
great
galleries
nell
were
you
not
afraid
of
losing
your
way
oh
no
harry
for
a
long
time
i
had
known
every
turn
of
the
new
did
you
never
leave
it
yes
now
and
then
answered
the
girl
with
a
little
hesitation
sometimes
i
have
been
as
far
as
the
old
mine
of
so
you
knew
our
old
cottage
the
cottage
oh
yes
but
the
people
who
lived
there
i
only
saw
at
a
great
they
were
my
father
and
mother
said
harry
and
i
was
there
too
we
have
always
lived
there
we
never
would
give
up
the
old
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
if
you
had
murmured
the
maiden
why
so
nell
was
it
not
just
because
we
were
obstinately
resolved
to
remain
that
we
ended
by
discovering
the
new
vein
of
coal
and
did
not
that
discovery
lead
to
the
happy
result
of
providing
work
for
a
large
population
and
restoring
them
to
ease
and
comfort
and
did
it
not
enable
us
to
find
you
nell
to
save
your
life
and
give
you
the
love
of
all
our
hearts
ah
yes
for
me
indeed
it
is
well
whatever
may
happen
replied
nell
earnestly
for
others
who
can
tell
what
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
nothing
but
it
used
to
be
very
dangerous
at
that
time
to
go
into
the
new
cutting
yes
very
dangerous
indeed
harry
once
some
rash
people
made
their
way
into
these
chasms
they
got
a
long
long
way
they
were
lost
they
were
lost
said
harry
looking
at
her
yes
lost
repeated
nell
in
a
trembling
voice
they
could
not
find
their
way
and
there
cried
harry
they
were
imprisoned
during
eight
long
days
they
were
at
the
point
of
death
nell
and
but
for
a
kind
and
charitable
being
an
angel
perhaps
sent
by
god
to
help
them
who
secretly
brought
them
a
little
food
but
for
a
mysterious
guide
who
afterwards
led
to
them
their
deliverers
they
never
would
have
escaped
from
that
living
tomb
and
how
do
you
know
about
that
demanded
the
girl
because
those
men
were
james
starr
my
father
and
myself
nell
nell
looked
up
hastily
seized
the
young
man
s
hand
and
gazed
so
fixedly
into
his
eyes
that
his
feelings
were
stirred
to
their
depths
you
were
there
at
last
she
uttered
i
was
indeed
said
harry
after
a
pause
and
she
to
whom
we
owe
our
lives
can
have
been
none
other
than
yourself
nell
nell
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
without
speaking
harry
had
never
seen
her
so
much
affected
those
who
saved
your
life
nell
added
he
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
already
owed
theirs
to
you
do
you
think
they
will
ever
forget
it
chapter
xiii
on
the
revolving
ladder
the
mining
operations
at
new
aberfoyle
continued
to
be
carried
on
very
successfully
as
a
matter
of
course
the
engineer
james
starr
as
well
as
simon
ford
the
discoverers
of
this
rich
carboniferous
region
shared
largely
in
the
profits
in
time
harry
became
a
partner
but
he
never
thought
of
quitting
the
cottage
he
took
his
father
s
place
as
overman
and
diligently
superintended
the
works
of
this
colony
of
miners
jack
ryan
was
proud
and
delighted
at
the
good
fortune
which
had
befallen
his
comrade
he
himself
was
getting
on
very
well
also
they
frequently
met
either
at
the
cottage
or
at
the
works
in
the
pit
jack
did
not
fail
to
remark
the
sentiments
entertained
by
harry
towards
nell
harry
would
not
confess
to
them
but
jack
only
laughed
at
him
when
he
shook
his
head
and
tried
to
deny
any
special
interest
in
her
it
must
be
noted
that
jack
ryan
had
the
greatest
possible
wish
to
be
of
the
party
when
nell
should
pay
her
first
visit
to
the
upper
surface
of
the
county
of
stirling
he
wished
to
see
her
wonder
and
admiration
on
first
beholding
the
yet
unknown
face
of
nature
he
very
much
hoped
that
harry
would
take
him
with
them
when
the
excursion
was
made
as
yet
however
the
latter
had
made
no
proposal
of
the
kind
to
him
which
caused
him
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
as
to
his
intentions
one
morning
jack
ryan
was
descending
through
a
shaft
which
led
from
the
surface
to
the
lower
regions
of
the
pit
he
did
so
by
means
of
one
of
those
ladders
which
continually
revolving
by
machinery
enabled
persons
to
ascend
and
descend
without
fatigue
this
apparatus
had
lowered
him
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
when
at
a
narrow
he
perceived
harry
who
was
coming
up
to
his
labors
for
the
day
well
met
my
friend
cried
jack
recognizing
his
comrade
by
the
light
of
the
electric
lamps
ah
jack
replied
harry
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
ve
got
something
to
i
can
listen
to
nothing
till
you
tell
me
how
nell
is
interrupted
jack
ryan
nell
is
all
right
jack
so
much
so
in
fact
that
i
hope
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
to
marry
her
harry
jack
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
ah
that
s
very
likely
but
i
know
quite
well
what
i
shall
what
will
you
do
marry
her
myself
if
you
don
t
so
look
sharp
laughed
jack
by
saint
mungo
i
think
an
immense
deal
of
bonny
nell
a
fine
young
creature
like
that
who
has
been
brought
up
in
the
mine
is
just
the
very
wife
for
a
miner
she
is
an
orphan
so
am
i
and
if
you
don
t
care
much
for
her
and
if
she
will
have
me
harry
looked
gravely
at
jack
and
let
him
talk
on
without
trying
to
stop
him
don
t
you
begin
to
feel
jealous
harry
asked
jack
in
a
more
serious
tone
not
at
all
answered
harry
quietly
but
if
you
don
t
marry
nell
yourself
you
surely
can
t
expect
her
to
remain
a
spinster
i
expect
nothing
said
harry
a
movement
of
the
ladder
machinery
now
gave
the
two
friends
the
opportunity
one
to
go
up
the
other
down
the
shaft
however
they
remained
where
they
were
harry
quoth
jack
do
you
think
i
spoke
in
earnest
just
now
about
nell
no
that
i
don
t
well
but
now
i
will
you
speak
in
earnest
my
good
fellow
i
can
tell
you
i
am
quite
capable
of
giving
a
friend
a
bit
of
let
s
hear
then
jack
well
look
here
you
love
nell
as
heartily
as
she
deserves
old
simon
your
father
and
old
madge
your
mother
both
love
her
as
if
she
were
their
daughter
why
don
t
you
make
her
so
in
reality
why
don
t
you
marry
her
come
jack
said
harry
you
are
running
on
as
if
you
knew
how
nell
felt
on
the
everybody
knows
that
replied
jack
and
therefore
it
is
impossible
to
make
you
jealous
of
any
of
us
but
here
goes
the
ladder
again
i
m
off
stop
a
minute
jack
cried
harry
detaining
his
companion
who
was
stepping
onto
the
moving
staircase
i
say
you
seem
to
mean
me
to
take
up
my
quarters
here
altogether
do
be
serious
and
listen
jack
i
want
to
speak
in
earnest
myself
well
i
ll
listen
till
the
ladder
moves
again
not
a
minute
jack
resumed
harry
i
need
not
pretend
that
i
do
not
love
nell
i
wish
above
all
things
to
make
her
my
that
s
all
right
but
for
the
present
i
have
scruples
of
conscience
as
to
asking
her
to
make
me
a
promise
which
would
be
what
can
you
mean
harry
i
mean
just
this
that
it
being
certain
nell
has
never
been
outside
this
coal
mine
in
the
very
depths
of
which
she
was
born
it
stands
to
reason
that
she
knows
nothing
and
can
comprehend
nothing
of
what
exists
beyond
it
her
eyes
yes
and
perhaps
also
her
heart
have
everything
yet
to
learn
who
can
tell
what
her
thoughts
will
be
when
perfectly
new
impressions
shall
be
made
upon
her
mind
as
yet
she
knows
nothing
of
the
world
and
to
me
it
would
seem
like
deceiving
her
if
i
led
her
to
decide
in
ignorance
upon
choosing
to
remain
all
her
life
in
the
coal
mine
do
you
understand
me
jack
hem
yes
pretty
well
what
i
understand
best
is
that
you
are
going
to
make
me
miss
another
turn
of
the
jack
replied
harry
gravely
if
this
machinery
were
to
stop
altogether
if
this
were
to
fall
beneath
our
feet
you
must
and
shall
hear
what
i
have
to
well
done
harry
that
s
how
i
like
to
be
spoken
to
let
s
settle
then
that
before
you
marry
nell
she
shall
go
to
school
in
auld
no
indeed
jack
i
am
perfectly
able
myself
to
educate
the
person
who
is
to
be
my
sure
that
will
be
a
great
deal
better
harry
but
first
of
all
resumed
harry
i
wish
that
nell
should
gain
a
real
knowledge
of
the
upper
world
to
illustrate
my
meaning
jack
suppose
you
were
in
love
with
a
blind
girl
and
someone
said
to
you
in
a
month
s
time
her
sight
will
be
restored
would
you
not
wait
till
after
she
was
cured
to
marry
her
faith
to
be
sure
i
would
exclaimed
jack
well
jack
nell
is
at
present
blind
and
before
she
marries
me
i
wish
her
to
see
what
i
am
and
what
the
life
really
is
to
which
she
would
bind
herself
in
short
she
must
have
daylight
let
in
upon
the
subject
well
said
harry
very
well
said
indeed
cried
jack
now
i
see
what
you
are
driving
at
and
when
may
we
expect
the
operation
to
come
off
in
a
month
jack
replied
harry
nell
is
getting
used
to
the
light
of
our
reflectors
that
is
some
preparation
in
a
month
she
will
i
hope
have
seen
the
earth
and
its
wonders
the
sky
and
its
splendors
she
will
perceive
that
the
limits
of
the
universe
are
but
while
harry
was
thus
giving
the
rein
to
his
imagination
jack
ryan
quitting
the
platform
had
leaped
on
the
step
of
the
moving
machinery
hullo
jack
where
are
you
far
beneath
you
laughed
the
merry
fellow
while
you
soar
to
the
heights
i
plunge
into
the
fare
ye
well
jack
returned
harry
himself
laying
hold
of
the
rising
ladder
mind
you
say
nothing
about
what
i
have
been
telling
not
a
word
shouted
jack
but
i
make
one
what
is
that
that
i
may
be
one
of
the
party
when
nell
s
first
excursion
to
the
face
of
the
earth
comes
off
so
you
shall
jack
i
promise
you
a
fresh
throb
of
the
machinery
placed
a
yet
more
considerable
distance
between
the
friends
their
voices
sounded
faintly
to
each
other
harry
however
could
still
hear
jack
shouting
i
say
do
you
know
what
nell
will
like
better
than
either
sun
moon
or
stars
after
she
s
seen
the
whole
of
them
no
jack
why
you
yourself
old
fellow
still
you
always
you
and
jack
s
voice
died
away
in
a
prolonged
hurrah
harry
after
this
applied
himself
diligently
during
all
his
spare
time
to
the
work
of
nell
s
education
he
taught
her
to
read
and
to
write
and
such
rapid
progress
did
she
make
it
might
have
been
said
that
she
learnt
by
instinct
never
did
keen
intelligence
more
quickly
triumph
over
utter
ignorance
it
was
the
wonder
of
all
beholders
simon
and
madge
became
every
day
more
and
more
attached
to
their
adopted
child
whose
former
history
continued
to
puzzle
them
a
good
deal
they
plainly
saw
the
nature
of
harry
s
feelings
towards
her
and
were
far
from
displeased
thereat
they
recollected
that
simon
had
said
to
the
engineer
on
his
first
visit
to
the
old
cottage
how
can
our
son
ever
think
of
marrying
where
could
a
wife
possibly
be
found
suitable
for
a
lad
whose
whole
life
must
be
passed
in
the
depths
of
a
coal
mine
well
now
it
seemed
as
if
the
most
desirable
companion
in
the
world
had
been
led
to
him
by
providence
was
not
this
like
a
blessing
direct
from
heaven
so
the
old
man
made
up
his
mind
that
if
the
wedding
did
take
place
the
miners
of
new
aberfoyle
should
have
a
at
coal
town
which
they
would
never
during
their
lives
forget
simon
ford
little
knew
what
he
was
saying
it
must
be
remarked
that
another
person
wished
for
this
union
of
harry
and
nell
as
much
as
simon
did
and
that
was
james
starr
the
engineer
of
course
he
was
really
interested
in
the
happiness
of
the
two
young
people
but
another
motive
connected
with
wider
interests
influenced
him
to
desire
it
it
has
been
said
that
james
starr
continued
to
entertain
a
certain
amount
of
apprehension
although
for
the
present
nothing
appeared
to
justify
it
yet
that
which
had
been
might
again
be
this
mystery
about
the
new
cutting
nell
was
evidently
the
only
person
acquainted
with
it
now
if
fresh
dangers
were
in
store
for
the
miners
of
aberfoyle
how
were
they
possibly
to
be
guarded
against
without
so
much
as
knowing
the
cause
of
them
nell
has
persisted
in
keeping
silence
said
james
starr
very
often
but
what
she
has
concealed
from
others
she
will
not
long
hide
from
her
husband
any
danger
would
be
danger
to
harry
as
well
as
to
the
rest
of
us
therefore
a
marriage
which
brings
happiness
to
the
lovers
and
safety
to
their
friends
will
be
a
good
marriage
if
ever
there
is
such
a
thing
here
thus
not
illogically
reasoned
james
starr
he
communicated
his
ideas
to
old
simon
who
decidedly
appreciated
them
nothing
then
appeared
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
match
what
in
fact
was
there
to
prevent
it
they
loved
each
other
the
parents
desired
nothing
better
for
their
son
harry
s
comrades
envied
his
good
fortune
but
freely
acknowledged
that
he
deserved
it
the
maiden
depended
on
no
one
else
and
had
but
to
give
the
consent
of
her
own
heart
why
then
if
there
were
none
to
place
obstacles
in
the
way
of
this
union
why
as
night
came
on
and
the
labors
of
the
day
being
over
the
electric
lights
in
the
mine
were
extinguished
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
coal
town
at
rest
within
their
dwellings
why
did
a
mysterious
form
always
emerge
from
the
gloomier
recesses
of
new
aberfoyle
and
silently
glide
through
the
darkness
what
instinct
guided
this
phantom
with
ease
through
passages
so
narrow
as
to
appear
to
be
impracticable
why
should
the
strange
being
with
eyes
flashing
through
the
deepest
darkness
come
cautiously
creeping
along
the
shores
of
lake
malcolm
why
so
directly
make
his
way
towards
simon
s
cottage
yet
so
carefully
as
hitherto
to
avoid
notice
why
bending
towards
the
windows
did
he
strive
to
catch
by
listening
some
fragment
of
the
conversation
within
the
closed
shutters
and
on
catching
a
few
words
why
did
he
shake
his
fist
with
a
menacing
gesture
towards
the
calm
abode
while
from
between
his
set
teeth
issued
these
words
in
muttered
fury
she
and
he
never
never
chapter
xiv
a
sunrise
a
month
after
this
on
the
evening
of
the
of
august
simon
ford
and
madge
took
leave
with
all
manner
of
good
wishes
of
four
tourists
who
were
setting
forth
from
the
cottage
james
starr
harry
and
jack
ryan
were
about
to
lead
nell
s
steps
over
yet
untrodden
paths
and
to
show
her
the
glories
of
nature
by
a
light
to
which
she
was
as
yet
a
stranger
the
excursion
was
to
last
for
two
days
james
starr
as
well
as
harry
considered
that
during
these
eight
and
forty
hours
spent
above
ground
the
maiden
would
be
able
to
see
everything
of
which
she
must
have
remained
ignorant
in
the
gloomy
pit
all
the
varied
aspects
of
the
globe
towns
plains
mountains
rivers
lakes
gulfs
and
seas
would
pass
before
her
eyes
in
that
part
of
scotland
lying
between
edinburgh
and
glasgow
nature
would
seem
to
have
collected
and
set
forth
specimens
of
every
one
of
these
terrestrial
beauties
as
to
the
heavens
they
would
be
spread
abroad
as
over
the
whole
earth
with
their
changeful
clouds
serene
or
veiled
moon
their
radiant
sun
and
clustering
stars
the
expedition
had
been
planned
so
as
to
combine
a
view
of
all
these
things
simon
and
madge
would
have
been
glad
to
go
with
nell
but
they
never
left
their
cottage
willingly
and
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
quit
their
subterranean
home
for
a
single
day
james
starr
went
as
an
observer
and
philosopher
curious
to
note
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
the
novel
impressions
made
upon
nell
perhaps
also
with
some
hope
of
detecting
a
clue
to
the
mysterious
events
connected
with
her
childhood
harry
with
a
little
trepidation
asked
himself
whether
it
was
not
possible
that
this
rapid
initiation
into
the
things
of
the
exterior
world
would
change
the
maiden
he
had
known
and
loved
hitherto
into
quite
a
different
girl
as
for
jack
ryan
he
was
as
joyous
as
a
lark
rising
in
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
he
only
trusted
that
his
gayety
would
prove
contagious
and
enliven
his
traveling
companions
thus
rewarding
them
for
letting
him
join
them
nell
was
pensive
and
silent
james
starr
had
decided
very
sensibly
to
set
off
in
the
evening
it
would
be
very
much
better
for
the
girl
to
pass
gradually
from
the
darkness
of
night
to
the
full
light
of
day
and
that
would
in
this
way
be
managed
since
between
midnight
and
noon
she
would
experience
the
successive
phases
of
shade
and
sunshine
to
which
her
sight
had
to
get
accustomed
just
as
they
left
the
cottage
nell
took
harry
s
hand
saying
harry
is
it
really
necessary
for
me
to
leave
the
mine
at
all
even
for
these
few
days
yes
it
is
nell
replied
the
young
man
it
is
needful
for
both
of
but
harry
resumed
nell
ever
since
you
found
me
i
have
been
as
happy
as
i
can
possibly
be
you
have
been
teaching
me
why
is
that
not
enough
what
am
i
going
up
there
for
harry
looked
at
her
in
silence
nell
was
giving
utterance
to
nearly
his
own
thoughts
my
child
said
james
starr
i
can
well
understand
the
hesitation
you
feel
but
it
will
be
good
for
you
to
go
with
us
those
who
love
you
are
taking
you
and
they
will
bring
you
back
again
afterwards
you
will
be
free
if
you
wish
it
to
continue
your
life
in
the
coal
mine
like
old
simon
and
madge
and
harry
but
at
least
you
ought
to
be
able
to
compare
what
you
give
up
with
what
you
choose
then
decide
freely
come
come
dear
nell
cried
harry
harry
i
am
willing
to
follow
you
replied
the
maiden
at
nine
o
clock
the
last
train
through
the
tunnel
started
to
convey
nell
and
her
companions
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
twenty
minutes
later
they
alighted
on
the
platform
where
the
branch
line
to
new
aberfoyle
joins
the
railway
from
dumbarton
to
stirling
the
night
was
already
dark
from
the
horizon
to
the
zenith
light
vapory
clouds
hurried
through
the
upper
air
driven
by
a
refreshing
northwesterly
breeze
the
day
had
been
lovely
the
night
promised
to
be
so
likewise
on
reaching
stirling
nell
and
her
friends
quitting
the
train
left
the
station
immediately
just
before
them
between
high
trees
they
could
see
a
road
which
led
to
the
banks
of
the
river
forth
the
first
physical
impression
on
the
girl
was
the
purity
of
the
air
inhaled
eagerly
by
her
lungs
breathe
it
freely
nell
said
james
starr
it
is
fragrant
with
all
the
scents
of
the
open
what
is
all
that
smoke
passing
over
our
heads
inquired
nell
those
are
clouds
answered
harry
blown
along
by
the
westerly
ah
said
nell
how
i
should
like
to
feel
myself
carried
along
in
that
silent
whirl
and
what
are
those
shining
sparks
which
glance
here
and
there
between
rents
in
the
clouds
those
are
the
stars
i
have
told
you
about
nell
so
many
suns
they
are
so
many
centers
of
worlds
like
our
own
most
the
constellations
became
more
clearly
visible
as
the
wind
cleared
the
clouds
from
the
deep
blue
of
the
firmament
nell
gazed
upon
the
myriad
stars
which
sparkled
overhead
but
how
is
it
she
said
at
length
that
if
these
are
suns
my
eyes
can
endure
their
brightness
my
child
replied
james
starr
they
are
indeed
suns
but
suns
at
an
enormous
distance
the
nearest
of
these
millions
of
stars
whose
rays
can
reach
us
is
vega
that
star
in
lyra
which
you
observe
near
the
zenith
and
that
is
fifty
thousand
millions
of
leagues
distant
its
brightness
therefore
can
not
affect
your
vision
but
our
own
sun
which
will
rise
is
only
distant
millions
of
leagues
and
no
human
eye
can
gaze
fixedly
upon
that
for
it
is
brighter
than
the
blaze
of
any
furnace
but
come
nell
come
they
pursued
their
way
james
starr
leading
the
maiden
harry
walking
by
her
side
while
jack
ryan
roamed
about
like
a
young
dog
impatient
of
the
slow
pace
of
his
masters
the
road
was
lonely
nell
kept
looking
at
the
great
trees
whose
branches
waving
in
the
wind
made
them
seem
to
her
like
giants
gesticulating
wildly
the
sound
of
the
breeze
in
the
the
deep
silence
during
a
lull
the
distant
line
of
the
horizon
which
could
be
discerned
when
the
road
passed
over
open
levels
all
these
things
filled
her
with
new
sensations
and
left
lasting
impressions
on
her
mind
after
some
time
she
ceased
to
ask
questions
and
her
companions
respected
her
silence
not
wishing
to
influence
by
any
words
of
theirs
the
girl
s
highly
sensitive
imagination
but
preferring
to
allow
ideas
to
arise
spontaneously
in
her
soul
at
about
half
past
eleven
o
clock
they
gained
the
banks
of
the
river
forth
there
a
boat
chartered
by
james
starr
awaited
them
in
a
few
hours
it
would
convey
them
all
to
granton
nell
looked
at
the
clear
water
which
flowed
up
to
her
feet
as
the
waves
broke
gently
on
the
beach
reflecting
the
starlight
is
this
a
lake
said
she
no
replied
harry
it
is
a
great
river
flowing
towards
the
sea
and
soon
opening
so
widely
as
to
resemble
a
gulf
taste
a
little
of
the
water
in
the
hollow
of
your
hand
nell
and
you
will
perceive
that
it
is
not
sweet
like
the
waters
of
lake
the
maiden
bent
towards
the
stream
and
raising
a
little
water
to
her
lips
this
is
quite
salt
said
she
yes
the
tide
is
full
the
sea
water
flows
up
the
river
as
far
as
this
answered
harry
oh
harry
harry
exclaimed
the
maiden
what
can
that
red
glow
on
the
horizon
be
is
it
a
forest
on
fire
no
it
is
the
rising
moon
to
be
sure
that
s
the
moon
cried
jack
ryan
a
fine
big
silver
plate
which
the
spirits
of
air
hand
round
and
round
the
sky
to
collect
the
stars
in
like
why
jack
said
the
engineer
laughing
i
had
no
idea
you
could
strike
out
such
bold
comparisons
well
but
starr
it
is
a
just
comparison
don
t
you
see
the
stars
disappear
as
the
moon
passes
on
so
i
suppose
they
drop
into
what
you
mean
to
say
jack
is
that
the
superior
brilliancy
of
the
moon
eclipses
that
of
stars
of
the
sixth
magnitude
therefore
they
vanish
as
she
how
beautiful
all
this
is
repeated
nell
again
and
again
with
her
whole
soul
in
her
eyes
but
i
thought
the
moon
was
round
so
she
is
when
full
said
james
starr
that
means
when
she
is
just
opposite
to
the
sun
but
the
moon
is
in
the
last
quarter
shorn
of
her
just
proportions
and
friend
jack
s
grand
silver
plate
looks
more
like
a
barber
s
oh
starr
what
a
base
comparison
he
exclaimed
i
was
just
going
to
begin
a
sonnet
to
the
moon
but
your
barber
s
basin
has
destroyed
all
chance
of
an
gradually
the
moon
ascended
the
heavens
before
her
light
the
lingering
clouds
fled
away
while
stars
still
sparkled
in
the
west
beyond
the
influence
of
her
radiance
nell
gazed
in
silence
on
the
glorious
spectacle
the
soft
silvery
light
was
pleasant
to
her
eyes
and
her
little
trembling
hand
expressed
to
harry
who
clasped
it
how
deeply
she
was
affected
by
the
scene
let
us
embark
now
said
james
starr
we
have
to
get
to
the
top
of
arthur
s
seat
before
the
boat
was
moored
to
a
post
on
the
bank
a
boatman
awaited
them
nell
and
her
friends
took
their
seats
the
sail
was
spread
it
quickly
filled
before
the
northwesterly
breeze
and
they
sped
on
their
way
what
a
new
sensation
was
this
for
the
maiden
she
had
been
rowed
on
the
waters
of
lake
malcolm
but
the
oar
handled
ever
so
lightly
by
harry
always
betrayed
effort
on
the
part
of
the
oarsman
now
for
the
first
time
nell
felt
herself
borne
along
with
a
gliding
movement
like
that
of
a
balloon
through
the
air
the
water
was
smooth
as
a
lake
and
nell
reclined
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
enjoying
its
gentle
rocking
occasionally
the
effect
of
the
moonlight
on
the
waters
was
as
though
the
boat
sailed
across
a
glittering
silver
field
little
wavelets
rippled
along
the
banks
it
was
enchanting
at
length
nell
was
overcome
with
drowsiness
her
eyelids
drooped
her
head
sank
on
harry
s
shoulder
she
slept
harry
sorry
that
she
should
miss
any
of
the
beauties
of
this
magnificent
night
would
have
aroused
her
let
her
sleep
said
the
engineer
she
will
better
enjoy
the
novelties
of
the
day
after
a
couple
of
hours
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
boat
reached
granton
pier
nell
awoke
have
i
been
asleep
inquired
she
no
my
child
said
james
starr
you
have
been
dreaming
that
you
slept
that
s
the
night
continued
clear
the
moon
riding
in
diffused
her
rays
on
all
sides
in
the
little
port
of
granton
lay
two
or
three
fishing
boats
they
rocked
gently
on
the
waters
of
the
firth
the
wind
fell
as
the
dawn
approached
the
atmosphere
clear
of
mists
promised
one
of
those
fine
autumn
days
so
delicious
on
the
sea
coast
a
soft
transparent
film
of
vapor
lay
along
the
horizon
the
first
sunbeam
would
dissipate
it
to
the
maiden
it
exhibited
that
aspect
of
the
sea
which
seems
to
blend
it
with
the
sky
her
view
was
now
enlarged
without
producing
the
impression
of
the
boundless
infinity
of
ocean
harry
taking
nell
s
hand
they
followed
james
starr
and
jack
ryan
as
they
traversed
the
deserted
streets
to
nell
this
suburb
of
the
capital
appeared
only
a
collection
of
gloomy
dark
houses
just
like
coal
town
only
that
the
roof
was
higher
and
gleamed
with
small
lights
she
stepped
lightly
forward
and
easily
kept
pace
with
harry
are
you
not
tired
nell
asked
he
after
half
an
hour
s
walking
no
my
feet
seem
scarcely
to
touch
the
earth
returned
she
this
sky
above
us
seems
so
high
up
i
feel
as
if
i
could
take
wing
and
fly
i
say
keep
hold
of
her
cried
jack
ryan
our
little
nell
is
too
good
to
lose
i
feel
just
as
you
describe
though
myself
when
i
have
not
left
the
pit
for
a
long
it
is
when
we
no
longer
experience
the
oppressive
effect
of
the
vaulted
rocky
roof
above
coal
town
said
james
starr
that
the
spacious
firmament
appears
to
us
like
a
profound
abyss
into
which
we
have
as
it
were
a
desire
to
plunge
is
that
what
you
feel
nell
yes
starr
it
is
exactly
like
that
said
nell
it
makes
me
feel
ah
you
will
soon
get
over
that
nell
said
harry
you
will
get
used
to
the
outer
world
and
most
likely
forget
all
about
our
dark
coal
no
harry
never
said
nell
and
she
put
her
hand
over
her
eyes
as
though
she
would
recall
the
remembrance
of
everything
she
had
lately
quitted
between
the
silent
dwellings
of
the
city
the
party
passed
along
leith
walk
and
went
round
the
calton
hill
where
stood
in
the
light
of
the
gray
dawn
the
buildings
of
the
observatory
and
nelson
s
monument
by
regent
s
bridge
and
the
north
bridge
they
at
last
reached
the
lower
extremity
of
the
canongate
the
town
still
lay
wrapt
in
slumber
nell
pointed
to
a
large
building
in
the
center
of
an
open
space
asking
what
great
confused
mass
is
that
that
confused
mass
nell
is
the
palace
of
the
ancient
kings
of
scotland
that
is
holyrood
where
many
a
sad
scene
has
been
enacted
the
historian
can
here
invoke
many
a
royal
shade
from
those
of
the
early
scottish
kings
to
that
of
the
unhappy
mary
stuart
and
the
french
king
charles
x
when
day
breaks
however
nell
this
palace
will
not
look
so
very
gloomy
holyrood
with
its
four
embattled
towers
is
not
unlike
some
handsome
country
house
but
let
us
pursue
our
way
there
just
above
the
ancient
abbey
of
holyrood
are
the
superb
cliffs
called
salisbury
crags
arthur
s
seat
rises
above
them
and
that
is
where
we
are
going
from
the
summit
of
arthur
s
seat
nell
your
eyes
shall
behold
the
sun
appear
above
the
horizon
they
entered
the
king
s
park
then
gradually
ascending
they
passed
across
the
queen
s
drive
a
splendid
carriageway
encircling
the
hill
which
we
owe
to
a
few
lines
in
one
of
sir
walter
scott
s
romances
arthur
s
seat
is
in
truth
only
a
hill
seven
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
which
stands
alone
amid
surrounding
heights
in
less
than
half
an
hour
by
an
easy
winding
path
james
starr
and
his
party
reached
the
crest
of
the
crouching
lion
which
seen
from
the
west
arthur
s
seat
so
much
resembles
there
all
four
seated
themselves
and
james
starr
ever
ready
with
quotations
from
the
great
scottish
novelist
simply
said
listen
to
what
is
written
by
sir
walter
scott
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
heart
of
if
i
were
to
choose
a
spot
from
which
the
rising
or
setting
sun
could
be
seen
to
the
greatest
possible
advantage
it
would
be
from
this
now

nell
the
sun
will
soon
appear
and
for
the
first
time
you
will
contemplate
its
the
maiden

her
eyes
eastward
harry
keeping
close
beside
her

her
with
anxious
interest
would
the
first
beams
of
day
overpower
her
feelings
all
remained
quiet
even
jack
ryan
a
faint
streak
of
pale
rose
tinted
the
light
vapors
of
the
horizon
it
was
the
first
ray
of
light
attacking
the
laggards
of
the
night
beneath
the
hill
lay
the
silent
city
massed
confusedly
in
the
twilight
of
dawn
here
and
there
lights
twinkled
among
the
houses
of
the
old
town
westward
rose
many
soon
to
be
illuminated
by
tips
of
fire
now
the
distant
horizon
of
the
sea
became
more
plainly
visible
the
scale
of
colors
fell
into
the
order
of
the
solar
every
instant
they
increased
in
intensity

red

fiery
daylight

now

towards
the
city
of
which
the
outlines
became
more
distinct
lofty
monuments
slender
steeples
emerged
from
the
gloom
a
kind
of
ashy
light
was
spread
abroad
at
length
one
solitary
ray
struck
on
the
maiden
s
sight
it
was
that
ray
of
green
which
morning
or
evening
is
reflected
upwards
from
the
sea
when
the
horizon
is
clear
an
instant
afterwards
nell
turned
and
pointing
towards
a
bright
prominent
point
in
the
new

no

that

no

said
harry
the
sun
has
touched
with
gold
the
top
of
sir
walter
scott
s
monument
and
indeed
the
extreme
point
of
the
monument
blazed
like
the
light
of
a
pharos
it
was
day
the
sun
arose
his
disc
seemed
to
glitter
as
though
he
indeed
emerged
from
the
waters
of
the
sea
appearing
at
first
very
large
from
the
effects
of
refraction
he
contracted
as
he
rose
and
assumed
the
perfectly
circular
form
soon
no
eye
could
endure
the
dazzling
splendor
it
was
as
though
the
mouth
of
a
furnace
was
opened
through
the
sky
nell
closed
her
eyes
but
her
eyelids
could
not
exclude
the
glare
and
she
pressed
her
fingers
over
them
harry
advised
her
to
turn
in
the
opposite
direction
oh
no
said
she
my
eyes
must
get
used
to
look
at
what
yours
can
bear
to
see
even
through
her
hands
nell
perceived
a
rosy
light
which
became
more
white
as
the
sun
rose
above
the
horizon
as
her
sight
became
accustomed
to
it
her
eyelids
were
raised
and
at
length
her
eyes
drank
in
the
light
of
day
the
good
child
knelt
down
exclaiming
oh
lord
god
how
beautiful
is
thy
creation
then
she
rose
and
looked
around
at
her
feet
extended
the
panorama
of
edinburgh
the
clear
distinct
lines
of
streets
in
the
new
town
and
the
irregular
mass
of

sank

into

down

now
refreshed
and
able
to
look
boldly
forth
into
the
sunshine
while
her
lungs
with
ease
inhaled
the
free
and
healthful
air
her
eyes
learned
gladly
to
know
the
harmonious
varieties
of
color
as
they
rested
on
the
green
trees
the
azure
skies
and
all
the
endless
shades
of
lovely
flowers
and
plants
the

entered
at

from

watched
the
curious
movement
of

betook
themselves
to
the

james

you
don
t
know
this
country
jack
only
by
its
songs
starr
replied
jack
and
judging
by
those
it
must
be
so
it
is
so
it
is
cried
the
engineer
and
our
dear
nell
shall
see
it
to
the
best
a
steamboat
the
sinclair
by
name

tourists
about
to
make
the
excursion
to
the
lakes
nell
and
her
companions
went
on
board
the
day
had
begun
in
brilliant
sunshine
free
from
the
british
fogs
which
so
often
veil
the
skies
the
passengers
were
determined
to
lose
none
of
the
beauties
of
nature
to
be
displayed
during
the
thirty
miles
voyage
nell
seated
between
james
starr
and
harry
drank
in
with
every
faculty
the
magnificent
poetry
with
which
lovely
scottish
scenery
is
fraught
numerous
small
isles
and
islets
soon
appeared
as
though
thickly
sown
on
the
bosom
of
the
lake
the
sinclair
steamed
her
way
among
them
while
between
them
glimpses
could
be
had
of
quiet
valleys
or
wild
rocky
gorges
on
the
mainland
nell
said
james
starr
every
island
here
has
its
legend
perhaps
its
song
as
well
as
the
mountains
which
overshadow
the
lake
one
may
without
much
exaggeration
say
that
the
history
of
this
country
is
written
in
gigantic
characters
of
mountains
and
nell
listened
but
these
fighting
stories
made
her
sad
why
all
that
bloodshed
on
plains
which
to
her
seemed
enormous
and
where
surely
there
must
have
been
room
for
everybody
the
shores
of
the
lake
form
a
little
harbor
at
luss
nell
could
for
a
moment
catch
sight
of
the
old
tower
of
its
ancient
castle
then
the
sinclair
turning
northward
the
tourists
gazed
upon
ben
lomond
towering
nearly
feet
above
the
level
of
the
lake
oh
what
a
noble
mountain
cried
nell
what
a
view
there
must
be
from
the
top
yes
nell
answered
james
starr
see
how
haughtily
its
peak
rises
from
amidst
the
thicket
of
oaks
birches
and
heather
which
clothe
the
lower
portion
of
the
mountain
from
thence
one
may
see
of
old
caledonia
this
eastern
side
of
the
lake
was
the
special
abode
of
the
clan
mcgregor
at
no
great
distance
the
struggles
of
the
jacobites
and
hanoverians
repeatedly
dyed
with
blood
these
lonely
glens
over
these
scenes
shines
the
pale
moon
called
in
old
ballads
macfarlane
s
among
these
rocks
still
echo
the
immortal
names
of
rob
roy
and
mcgregor
as
the
sinclair
advanced
along
the
base
of
the
mountain
the
country
became
more
and
more
abrupt
in
character
trees
were
only
scattered
here
and
there
among
them
were
the
willows
slender
wands
of
which
were
formerly
used
for
hanging
persons
of
low
degree
to
economize
hemp
remarked
james
starr
the
lake
narrowed
very
much
as
it
stretched
northwards
the
steamer
passed
a
few
more
islets
inveruglas
where
stand
some
ruins
of
a
stronghold
of
the
clan
macfarlane
at
length
the
head
of
the
loch
was
reached
and
the
sinclair
stopped
at
inversnaid

a
steep
ascent
led
to
the
inn
of
stronachlacar
on
the
banks
of
loch
katrine
there
at
the
end
of
a
light
pier
floated
a
small
steamboat
named
as
a
matter
of
course
the
rob
roy
the
travelers
immediately
went
on
board
it
was
about
to
start
loch
katrine
is
only
ten
miles
in
length
its
width
never
exceeds
two
miles
the
hills
nearest
it
are
full
of
a
character
peculiar
to
themselves
here
we
are
on
this
famous
lake
said
james
starr
it
has
been
compared
to
an
eel
on
account
of
its
length
and
windings
and
justly
so
they
say
that
it
never
freezes
i
know
nothing
about
that
but
what
we
want
to
think
of
is
that
here
are
the
scenes
of
the
adventures
in
the
lady
of
the
lake
i
believe
if
friend
jack
looked
about
him
carefully
he
might
see
still
gliding
over
the
surface
of
the
water
the
shade
of
the
slender
form
of
sweet
ellen
to
be
sure
starr
replied
jack
why
should
i
not
i
may
just
as
well
see
that
pretty
girl
on
the
waters
of
loch
katrine
as
those
ugly
ghosts
on
loch
malcolm
in
the

it
was
by
this
time
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
less
hilly
shores
of

westward
extended
like
a

framed
between

to

the
for
our
tourists
who
meant
to
return
to
stirling
by
callander
nell
appeared
completely
worn
out
by
the
continued
excitement
of
the
day
a
faint
ejaculation
was
all
she
was
able
to
utter
in
token
of
admiration
as
new
objects
of
wonder
or
beauty
met
her
gaze
she
required
some
hours
of
rest
were
it
but
to
impress
lastingly
the
recollection
of
all
she
had
seen
her
hand
rested
in
harry
s
and
looking
earnestly
at
her
he
said
nell
dear
nell
we
shall
soon
be
home
again
in
the
gloomy
region
of
the
coal
mine
shall
you
not
pine
for
what
you
have
seen
during
these
few
hours
spent
in
the
glorious
light
of
day
no
harry
replied
the
girl
i
shall
like
to
think
about
it
but
i
am
glad
to
go
back
with
you
to
our
dear
old
nell
said
harry
vainly
attempting
to
steady
his
voice
are
you
willing
to
be
bound
to
me
by
the
most
sacred
tie
could
you
marry
me
nell
yes
harry
i
could
if
you
are
sure
that
i
am
able
to
make
you
happy
answered
the
maiden
raising
her
innocent
eyes
to
his
scarcely
had
she
pronounced
these
words
when
an
unaccountable
phenomenon
took
place
the
rob
roy
still
half
a
mile
from
land
experienced
a
violent
shock
she
suddenly
grounded
no
efforts
of
the
engine
could
move
her
the
cause
of
this
accident
was
simply
that
loch
katrine
was
all
at
once
emptied
as
though
an
enormous
fissure
had
opened
in
its
bed
in
a
few
seconds
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
sea
beach
at
low
water
nearly
the
whole
of
its
contents
had
vanished
into
the
bosom
of
the
earth
my
friends
exclaimed
james

as
the
cause
of
this
marvel

a
final
threat
on
that
day
in
the
colliery
of
new
aberfoyle
work
was
going
on
in
the
usual
regular
way
in
the
distance
could
be
heard
the
crash
of
great
charges
of
dynamite
by
which
the
carboniferous
rocks
were
blasted
here
masses
of
coal
were
loosened
by
and
crowbar
there
the
perforating
machines
with
their
harsh
grating
bored
through
the
masses
of
sandstone
and
schist
hollow
cavernous
noises
resounded
on
all
sides
draughts
of
air
rushed
along
the
ventilating
galleries
and
the
wooden
slammed
beneath
their
violent
gusts
in
the
lower
tunnels
trains
of
trucks
kept
passing
along
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
miles
an
hour
while
at
their
approach
electric
bells
warned
the
workmen
to
cower
down
in

lifts
went
incessantly
up
and
down
worked
by
powerful
engines
on
the

of

was
throughout
brilliantly
lighted
by
the
electric
lamps
at
full
power
mining
operations
were
being
carried
on
with
the
greatest
activity
coal
was
being
piled
incessantly
into
the
trucks
which
went
in
hundreds
to
empty
themselves
into
the
corves
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
while
parties
of
miners
who
had
labored
during
the
night
were
taking
needful
rest
the
others
worked
without
wasting
an
hour
old
simon
ford
and
madge
having
finished
their
dinner
were
resting
at
the
door
of
their
cottage
simon
smoked
a
good
pipe
of
tobacco
and
from
time
to
time
the
old
couple
spoke
of
nell
of
their
boy
of
starr
and
wondered
how
they
liked
their
trip
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
where
would
they
be
now
what
would
they
be
doing
how
could
they
stay
so
long
away
from
the
mine
without
feeling
homesick
just
then
a
terrific
roaring
noise
was
heard
it
was
like
the
sound
of
a
mighty
cataract
rushing
down
into
the
mine
the
old
people
rose
hastily
they
perceived
at
once
that
the
waters
of
loch
malcolm
were
rising
a
great
wave
unfurling
like
a
billow
swept
up
the
bank
and
broke
against
the
walls
of
the
cottage
simon
caught
his
wife
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
upper
part
of
their
dwelling
at
the
same
moment
cries
arose
from
all
parts
of
coal
town
which
was
threatened
by
a
sudden
inundation
the
inhabitants
fled
for
safety
to
the
top
of
the
schist
rocks
bordering
the
lake
terror
spread
in
all
directions
whole
families
in
frantic
haste
rushed
towards
the
tunnel
in
order
to
reach
the
upper
regions
of
the
pit
it
was
feared
that
the
sea
had
burst
into
the
colliery
for
its
galleries
and
passages
penetrated
as
far
as
the
caledonian
canal
in
that
case
the
entire
excavation
vast
as
it
was
would
be
completely
flooded
not
a
single
inhabitant
of
new
aberfoyle
would
escape
death
but
when
the
foremost
fugitives
reached
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
they
encountered
simon
ford
who
had
quitted
his
cottage
stop
my
friends
stop
shouted
the
old
man
if
our
town
is
to
be
overwhelmed
the
floods
will
rush
faster
than
you
can
no
one
can
possibly
escape
but
see
the
waters
are
rising
no
further
it
appears
to
me
the
danger
is
and
our
comrades
at
the
far
end
of
the
works
what
about
them
cried
some
of
the
miners
there
is
nothing
to
fear
for
them
replied
simon
they
are
working
on
a
higher
level
than
the
bed
of
the
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
old
man
was
in
the
right
the
sudden
influx
of
water
had
rushed
to
the
very
lowest
bed
of
the
vast
mine
and
its
only
ultimate
effect
was
to
raise
the
level
of
loch
malcolm
a
few
feet
coal
town
was
uninjured
and
it
was
reasonable
to
hope
that
no
one
had
perished
in
the
flood
of
water
which
had
descended
to
the
depths
of
the
mine
never
yet
penetrated
by
the
workmen
simon
and
his
men
could
not
decide
whether
this
inundation
was
owing
to
the
overflow
of
a
subterranean
sheet
of
water
penetrating
fissures
in
the
solid
rock
or
to
some
underground
torrent
breaking
through
its
worn
bed
and
precipitating
itself
to
the
lowest
level
of
the
mine
but
that
very
same
evening
they
knew
what
to
think
about
it
for
the
local
papers
published
an
account
of
the
marvelous
phenomenon
which
loch
katrine
had
exhibited
the
surprising
news
was
soon
after
confirmed
by
the
four
travelers
who
returning
with
all
possible
speed
to
the
cottage
learned
with
extreme
satisfaction
that
no
serious
damage
was
done
in
new
aberfoyle
the
bed
of
loch
katrine
had
fairly
given
way
the
waters
had
suddenly
broken
through
by
an
enormous
fissure
into
the
mine
beneath
of
sir
walter
scott
s
favorite
loch
there
was
not
left
enough
to
wet
the
pretty
foot
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
all
that
remained
was
a
pond
of
a
few
acres
at
the
further
extremity
this
singular
event
made
a
profound
sensation
in
the
country
it
was
a
thing
unheard
of
that
a
lake
should
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
empty
itself
and
disappear
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
erase
loch
katrine
from
the
map
of
scotland
until
by
public
subscription
it
could
be
refilled
care
being
of
course
taken
in
the
first
place
to
stop
the
rent
up
tight
this
catastrophe
would
have
been
the
death
of
sir
walter
scott
had
he
still
been
in
the
world
the
accident
was
explicable
when
it
was
ascertained
that
between
the
bed
of
the
lake
and
the
vast
cavity
beneath
the
geological
strata
had
become
reduced
to
a
thin
layer
incapable
of
longer
sustaining
the
weight
of
water
now
although
to
most
people
this
event
seemed
plainly
due
to
natural
causes
yet
to
james
starr
and
his
friends
simon
and
harry
ford
the
question
constantly
recurred
was
it
not
rather
to
be
attributed
to
malevolence
uneasy
suspicions
continually
harassed
their
minds
was
their
evil
genius
about
to
renew
his
persecution
of
those
who
ventured
to
work
this
rich
mine
at
the
cottage
some
days
later
james
starr
thus
discussed
the
matter
with
the
old
man
and
his
son
well
simon
said
he
to
my
thinking
we
must
class
this
circumstance
with
the
others
for
which
we
still
seek
elucidation
although
it
is
no
doubt
possible
to
explain
it
by
natural
i
am
quite
of
your
mind
james
replied
simon
but
take
my
advice
and
say
nothing
about
it
let
us
make
all
researches
oh
i
know
the
result
of
such
research
beforehand
cried
the
engineer
and
what
will
it
be
then
we
shall
find
proofs
of
malevolence
but
not
the
but
he
exists
he
is
there
where
can
he
lie
concealed
is
it
possible
to
conceive
that
the
most
depraved
human
being
could
carry
out
an
idea
so
infernal
as
that
of
bursting
through
the
bed
of
a
lake
i
believe
i
shall
end
by
thinking
like
jack
ryan
that
the
evil
demon
of
the
mine
revenges
himself
on
us
for
having
invaded
his
nell
was
allowed
to
hear
as
little
as
possible
of
these
discussions
indeed
she
showed
no
desire
to
enter
into
them
although
it
was
very
evident
that
she
shared
in
the
anxieties
of
her
adopted
parents
the
melancholy
in
her
countenance
bore
witness
to
much
mental
agitation
it
was
at
length
resolved
that
james
starr
together
with
simon
and
harry
should
return
to
the
scene
of
the
disaster
and
endeavor
to
satisfy
themselves
as
to
the
cause
of
it
they
mentioned
their
project
to
no
one
to
those
unacquainted
with
the
group
of
facts
on
which
it
was
based
the
opinion
of
starr
and
his
friends
could
not
fail
to
appear
wholly
inadmissible
a
few
days
later
the
three
friends
proceeded
in
a
small
boat
to
examine
the
natural
pillars
on
which
had
rested
the
solid
earth
forming
the
basin
of
loch
katrine
they
discovered
that
they
had
been
right
in
suspecting
that
the
massive
columns
had
been
undermined
by
blasting
the
blackened
traces
of
explosion
were
to
be
seen
the
waters
having
subsided
below
the
level
of
these
mysterious
operations
thus
the
fall
of
a
portion
of
the
vast
vaulted
dome
was
proved
to
have
been
premeditated
by
man
and
by
man
s
hand
had
it
been
effected
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
it
said
james
starr
and
who
can
say
what
might
not
have
happened
had
the
sea
instead
of
a
little
loch
been
let
in
upon
us
you
may
well
say
that
cried
the
old
overman
with
a
feeling
of
pride
in
his
beloved
mine
for
nothing
less
than
a
sea
would
have
drowned
our
aberfoyle
but
once
more
what
possible
interest
could
any
human
being
have
in
the
destruction
of
our
works
it
is
quite
incomprehensible
replied
james
starr
this
case
is
something
perfectly
unlike
that
of
a
band
of
common
criminals
who
concealing
themselves
in
dens
and
caves
go
forth
to
rob
and
pillage
the
surrounding
country
the
evil
deeds
of
such
men
would
certainly
in
the
course
of
three
years
have
betrayed
their
existence
and
neither
can
it
be
as
i
sometimes
used
to
think
that
smugglers
or
coiners
carried
on
their
illegal
practices
in
some
distant
and
unknown
corner
of
these
prodigious
caverns
and
were
consequently
anxious
to
drive
us
out
of
them
but
no
one
coins
false
money
or
obtains
contraband
goods
only
to
conceal
them
yet
it
is
clear
that
an
implacable
enemy
has
sworn
the
ruin
of
new
aberfoyle
and
that
some
interest
urges
him
to
seek
in
every
possible
way
to
wreak
his
hatred
upon
us
he
appears
to
be
too
weak
to
act
openly
and
lays
his
schemes
in
secret
but
displays
such
intelligence
as
to
render
him
a
most
formidable
foe
my
friends
he
must
understand
better
than
we
do
the
secrets
of
our
domain
since
he
has
all
this
time
eluded
our
vigilance
he
must
be
a
man
experienced
in
mining
skilled
beyond
the
most
skillful
that
s
certain
simon
we
have
proof
enough
of
that
let
me
see
have
you
never
had
a
personal
enemy
to
whom
your
suspicions
might
point
think
well
there
is
such
a
thing
as
hatred
which
time
never
softens
go
back
to
recollections
of
your
earliest
days
what
befalls
us
appears
the
work
of
a
stern
and
patient
will
and
to
explain
it
demands
every
effort
of
thought
and
simon
did
not
answer
immediately
his
mind
evidently
engaged
in
a
close
and
candid
survey
of
his
past
life
presently
raising
his
head
no
said
he
no
heaven
be
my
witness
neither
madge
nor
i
have
ever
injured
anybody
we
can
not
believe
that
we
have
a
single
enemy
in
the
ah
if
nell
would
only
speak
cried
the
engineer
mr
starr
and
you
father
said
harry
i
do
beg
of
you
to
keep
silence
on
this
matter
and
not
to
question
my
poor
nell
i
know
she
is
very
anxious
and
uneasy
and
i
feel
positive
that
some
great
secret
painfully
oppresses
her
heart
either
she
knows
nothing
it
would
be
of
any
use
for
us
to
hear
or
she
considers
it
her
duty
to
be
silent
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
her
affection
for
us
for
all
of
us
if
at
a
future
time
she
informs
me
of
what
she
has
hitherto
concealed
from
us
you
shall
know
about
it
so
be
it
then
harry
answered
the
engineer
and
yet
i
must
say
nell
s
silence
if
she
knows
anything
is
to
me
perfectly
harry
would
have
continued
her
defense
but
the
engineer
stopped
him
saying
all
right
harry
we
promise
to
say
no
more
about
it
to
your
future
with
my
father
s
consent
she
shall
be
my
wife
without
further
my
boy
said
old
simon
your
marriage
shall
take
place
this
very
day
month
starr
will
you
undertake
the
part
of
nell
s
father
you
may
reckon
upon
me
for
that
simon
answered
the
engineer
they
then
returned
to
the
cottage
but
said
not
a
word
of
the
result
of
their
examinations
in
the
mine
so
that
to
the
rest
of
its
inhabitants
the
bursting
in
of
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
caverns
continued
to
be
regarded
as
a
mere
accident
there
was
but
a
loch
the
less
in
scotland
nell
gradually
resumed
her
customary
duties
and
harry
made
good
use
of
her
little
visit
to
the
upper
air
in
the
instructions
he
gave
her
she
enjoyed
the
recollections
of
life
above
ground
yet
without
regretting
it
the
somber
region
she
had
loved
as
a
child
and
in
which
her
wedded
life
would
be
spent
was
as
dear
to
her
as
ever
the
approaching
marriage
created
great
excitement
in
new
aberfoyle
good
wishes
poured
in
on
all
sides
and
foremost
among
them
were
jack
ryan
s
he
was
detected
busily
practicing
his
best
songs
in
preparation
for
the
great
day
which
was
to
be
celebrated
by
the
whole
population
of
coal
town
during
the
month
preceding
the
there
were
more
accidents
occurring
in
new
aberfoyle
than
had
ever
been
known
in
the
place
one
would
have
thought
the
approaching
union
of
harry
and
nell
actually
provoked
one
catastrophe
after
another
these
misfortunes
happened
chiefly
at
the
further
and
lowest
extremity
of
the
works
and
the
cause
of
them
was
always
in
some
way
mysterious
thus
for
instance
the
of
a
distant
gallery
was
discovered
to
be
in
flames
which
were
extinguished
by
harry
and
his
companions
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
by
employing
engines
filled
with
water
and
carbonic
acid
always
kept
ready
in
case
of
necessity
the
lamp
used
by
the
incendiary
was
found
but
no
clew
whatever
as
to
who
he
could
be
another
time
an
inundation
took
place
in
consequence
of
the
stanchions
of
a
giving
way
and
starr
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
that
these
supports
had
first
of
all
been
partially
sawn
through
harry
who
had
been
overseeing
the
works
near
the
place
at
the
time
was
buried
in
the
falling
rubbish
and
narrowly
escaped
death
a
few
days
afterwards
on
the
steam
tramway
a
train
of
trucks
which
harry
was
passing
along
met
with
an
obstacle
on
the
rails
and
was
overturned
it
was
then
discovered
that
a
beam
had
been
laid
across
the
line
in
short
events
of
this
description
became
so
numerous
that
the
miners
were
seized
with
a
kind
of
panic
and
it
required
all
the
influence
of
their
chiefs
to
keep
them
on
the
works
you
would
think
that
there
was
a
whole
band
of
these
ruffians
simon
kept
saying
and
we
can
t
lay
hands
on
a
single
one
of
search
was
made
in
all
directions
the
county
police
were
on
the
alert
night
and
day
yet
discovered
nothing
the
evil
intentions
seeming
specially
designed
to
injure
harry
starr
forbade
him
to
venture
alone
beyond
the
ordinary
limits
of
the
works
they
were
equally
careful
of
nell
although
at
harry
s
entreaty
these
malicious
attempts
to
do
harm
were
concealed
from
her
because
they
might
remind
her
painfully
of
former
times
simon
and
madge
watched
over
her
by
day
and
by
night
with
a
sort
of
stern
solicitude
the
poor
child
yielded
to
their
wishes
without
a
remark
or
a
complaint
did
she
perceive
that
they
acted
with
a
view
to
her
interest
probably
she
did
and
on
her
part
she
seemed
to
watch
over
others
and
was
never
easy
unless
all
whom
she
loved
were
together
in
the
cottage
when
harry
came
home
in
the
evening
she
could
not
restrain
expressions
of
joy
very
unlike
her
usual
manner
which
was
rather
reserved
than
demonstrative
as
soon
as
day
broke
she
was
astir
before
anyone
else
and
her
constant
uneasiness
lasted
all
day
until
the
hour
of
return
home
from
work
harry
became
very
anxious
that
their
marriage
should
take
place
he
thought
that
when
the
irrevocable
step
was
taken
malevolence
would
be
disarmed
and
that
nell
would
never
feel
safe
until
she
was
his
wife
james
starr
simon
and
madge
were
all
of
the
same
opinion
and
everyone
counted
the
intervening
days
for
everyone
suffered
from
the
most
uncomfortable
forebodings
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
nothing
relating
to
nell
was
indifferent
to
this
hidden
foe
whom
it
was
impossible
to
meet
or
to
avoid
therefore
it
seemed
quite
possible
that
the
solemn
act
of
her
marriage
with
harry
might
be
the
occasion
of
some
new
and
dreadful
outbreak
of
his
hatred
one
morning
a
week
before
the
day
appointed
for
the
ceremony
nell
rising
early
went
out
of
the
cottage
before
anyone
else
no
sooner
had
she
crossed
the
threshold
than
a
cry
of
indescribable
anguish
escaped
her
lips
her
voice
was
heard
throughout
the
dwelling
in
a
moment
madge
harry
and
simon
were
at
her
side
nell
was
pale
as
death
her
countenance
agitated
her
features
expressing
the
utmost
horror
unable
to
speak
her
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
door
of
the
cottage
which
she
had
just
opened
with
rigid
fingers
she
pointed
to
the
following
words
traced
upon
it
during
the
night
simon
ford
you
have
robbed
me
of
the
last
vein
in
our
old
pit
harry
your
son
has
robbed
me
of
nell
woe
betide
you
woe
betide
you
all
woe
betide
new
aberfoyle
silfax
exclaimed
simon
and
madge
together
who
is
this
man
demanded
harry
looking
alternately
at
his
father
and
at
the
maiden
silfax
repeated
nell
in
tones
of
despair
silfax
and
murmuring
this
name
her
whole
frame
shuddering
with
fear
and
agitation
she
was
borne
away
to
her
chamber
by
old
madge
james
starr
hastening
to
the
spot
read
the
threatening
sentences
again
and
again
the
hand
which
traced
these
lines
said
he
at
length
is
the
same
which
wrote
me
the
letter
contradicting
yours
simon
the
man
calls
himself
silfax
i
see
by
your
troubled
manner
that
you
know
him
who
is
this
silfax
chapter
xvii
the
monk
this
name
revealed
everything
to
the
old
overman
it
was
that
of
the
last
monk
of
the
dochart
pit
in
former
days
before
the
invention
of
the
simon
had
known
this
fierce
man
whose
business
it
was
to
go
daily
at
the
risk
of
his
life
to
produce
partial
explosions
of
in
the
passages
he
used
to
see
this
strange
solitary
being
prowling
about
the
mine
always
accompanied
by
a
monstrous
owl
which
he
called
harfang
who
assisted
him
in
his
perilous
occupation
by
soaring
with
a
lighted
match
to
places
silfax
was
unable
to
reach
one
day
this
old
man
disappeared
and
at
the
same
time
also
a
little
orphan
girl
born
in
the
mine
who
had
no
relation
but
himself
her
it
was
perfectly
evident
now
that
this
child
was
nell
during
the
fifteen
years
up
to
the
time
when
she
was
saved
by
harry
they
must
have
lived
in
some
secret
abyss
of
the
mine
the
old
overman
full
of
mingled
compassion
and
anger
made
known
to
the
engineer
and
harry
all
that
the
name
of
silfax
had
revealed
to
him
it
explained
the
whole
mystery
silfax
was
the
mysterious
being
so
long
vainly
sought
for
in
the
depths
of
new
aberfoyle
so
you
knew
him
simon
demanded
starr
yes
that
i
did
replied
the
overman
the
harfang
man
we
used
to
call
him
why
he
was
old
then
he
must
be
fifteen
or
twenty
years
older
than
i
am
a
wild
savage
sort
of
fellow
who
held
aloof
from
everyone
and
was
known
to
fear
nothing
neither
fire
nor
water
it
was
his
own
fancy
to
follow
the
trade
of
monk
which
few
would
have
liked
the
constant
danger
of
the
business
had
unsettled
his
brain
he
was
prodigiously
strong
and
he
knew
the
mine
as
no
one
else
at
any
rate
as
well
as
i
did
he
lived
on
a
small
allowance
in
faith
i
believed
him
dead
years
but
resumed
james
starr
what
does
he
mean
by
those
words
you
have
robbed
me
of
the
last
vein
of
our
old
mine
ah
there
it
is
replied
simon
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
a
fancy
of
his
i
told
you
his
mind
was
deranged
that
he
had
a
right
to
the
mine
of
aberfoyle
so
he
became
more
and
more
savage
in
temper
the
deeper
the
dochart
pit
his
pit
was
worked
out
it
just
seemed
as
if
it
was
his
own
body
that
suffered
from
every
blow
of
the
pickax
you
must
remember
that
madge
ay
that
i
do
simon
replied
she
i
can
recollect
all
this
resumed
simon
since
i
have
seen
the
name
of
silfax
on
the
door
but
i
tell
you
i
thought
the
man
was
dead
and
never
imagined
that
the
spiteful
being
we
have
so
long
sought
for
could
be
the
old
fireman
of
the
dochart
well
now
then
said
starr
it
is
all
quite
plain
chance
made
known
to
silfax
the
new
vein
of
coal
with
the
egotism
of
madness
he
believed
himself
the
owner
of
a
treasure
he
must
conceal
and
defend
living
in
the
mine
and
wandering
about
day
and
night
he
perceived
that
you
had
discovered
the
secret
and
had
written
in
all
haste
to
beg
me
to
come
hence
the
letter
contradicting
yours
hence
after
my
arrival
all
the
accidents
that
occurred
such
as
the
block
of
stone
thrown
at
harry
the
broken
ladder
at
the
yarrow
shaft
the
obstruction
of
the
openings
into
the
wall
of
the
new
cutting
hence
in
short
our
imprisonment
and
then
our
deliverance
brought
about
by
the
kind
assistance
of
nell
who
acted
of
course
without
the
knowledge
of
this
man
silfax
and
contrary
to
his
you
describe
everything
exactly
as
it
must
have
happened
starr
returned
old
simon
the
old
monk
is
mad
enough
now
at
any
rate
all
the
better
quoth
madge
i
don
t
know
that
said
starr
shaking
his
head
it
is
a
terrible
sort
of
madness
ah
now
i
understand
that
the
very
thought
of
him
must
have
terrified
poor
little
nell
and
also
i
see
that
she
could
not
bear
to
denounce
her
grandfather
what
a
miserable
time
she
must
have
had
of
it
with
the
old
man
miserable
with
a
vengeance
replied
simon
between
that
savage
and
his
owl
as
savage
as
himself
depend
upon
it
that
bird
isn
t
dead
that
was
what
put
our
lamp
out
and
also
so
nearly
cut
the
rope
by
which
harry
and
nell
were
and
then
you
see
said
madge
this
news
of
the
marriage
of
our
son
with
his
granddaughter
added
to
his
rancor
and
to
be
sure
said
simon
to
think
that
his
nell
should
marry
one
of
the
robbers
of
his
own
coal
mine
would
just
drive
him
wild
he
will
have
to
make
up
his
mind
to
it
however
cried
harry
mad
as
he
is
we
shall
manage
to
convince
him
that
nell
is
better
off
with
us
here
than
ever
she
was
in
the
caverns
of
the
pit
i
am
sure
starr
if
we
could
only
catch
him
we
should
be
able
to
make
him
listen
to
my
poor
harry
there
is
no
reasoning
with
a
madman
replied
the
engineer
of
course
it
is
better
to
know
your
enemy
than
not
but
you
must
not
fancy
all
is
right
because
we
have
found
out
who
he
is
we
must
be
on
our
guard
my
friends
and
to
begin
with
harry
you
positively
must
question
nell
she
will
perceive
that
her
silence
is
no
longer
reasonable
even
for
her
grandfather
s
own
interest
she
ought
to
speak
now
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
for
ours
these
insane
plots
must
be
put
a
stop
i
feel
sure
starr
answered
harry
that
nell
will
of
herself
propose
to
tell
you
what
she
knows
you
see
it
was
from
a
sense
of
duty
that
she
has
been
silent
hitherto
my
mother
was
very
right
to
take
her
to
her
room
just
now
she
much
needed
time
to
recover
her
spirits
but
now
i
will
go
for
you
need
not
do
so
harry
said
the
maiden
in
a
clear
and
firm
voice
as
she
entered
at
that
moment
the
room
in
which
they
were
nell
was
very
pale
traces
of
tears
were
in
her
eyes
but
her
whole
manner
showed
that
she
had
nerved
herself
to
act
as
her
loyal
heart
dictated
as
her
duty
nell
cried
harry
springing
towards
her
the
girl
arrested
her
lover
by
a
gesture
and
continued
your
father
and
mother
and
you
harry
must
now
know
all
and
you
too
starr
must
remain
ignorant
of
nothing
that
concerns
the
child
you
have
received
and
whom
harry
unfortunately
for
him
alas
drew
from
the
oh
nell
what
are
you
saying
cried
harry
allow
her
to
speak
said
james
starr
in
a
decided
tone
i
am
the
granddaughter
of
old
silfax
resumed
nell
i
never
knew
a
mother
till
the
day
i
came
here
added
she
looking
at
madge
blessed
be
that
day
my
daughter
said
the
old
woman
i
knew
no
father
till
i
saw
simon
ford
continued
nell
nor
friend
till
the
day
when
harry
s
hand
touched
mine
alone
with
my
grandfather
i
have
lived
during
fifteen
years
in
the
remote
and
most
solitary
depths
of
the
mine
i
say
with
my
grandfather
but
i
can
scarcely
use
the
expression
for
i
seldom
saw
him
when
he
disappeared
from
old
aberfoyle
he
concealed
himself
in
caverns
known
only
to
himself
in
his
way
he
was
kind
to
me
dreadful
as
he
was
he
fed
me
with
whatever
he
could
procure
from
outside
the
mine
but
i
can
dimly
recollect
that
in
my
earliest
years
i
was
the
nursling
of
a
goat
the
death
of
which
was
a
bitter
grief
to
me
my
grandfather
seeing
my
distress
brought
me
another
animal
a
dog
he
said
it
was
but
unluckily
this
dog
was
lively
and
barked
grandfather
did
not
like
anything
cheerful
he
had
a
horror
of
noise
and
had
taught
me
to
be
silent
the
dog
he
could
not
teach
to
be
quiet
so
the
poor
animal
very
soon
disappeared
my
grandfather
s
companion
was
a
ferocious
bird
harfang
of
which
at
first
i
had
a
perfect
horror
but
this
creature
in
spite
of
my
dislike
to
it
took
such
a
strong
affection
for
me
that
i
could
not
help
returning
it
it
even
obeyed
me
better
than
its
master
which
used
to
make
me
quite
uneasy
for
my
grandfather
was
jealous
harfang
and
i
did
not
dare
to
let
him
see
us
much
together
we
both
knew
it
would
be
dangerous
but
i
am
talking
too
much
about
myself
the
great
thing
is
about
no
my
child
said
james
starr
tell
us
everything
that
comes
to
your
my
grandfather
continued
nell
always
regarded
your
abode
in
the
mine
with
a
very
evil
eye
not
that
there
was
any
lack
of
space
his
chosen
refuge
was
far
very
far
from
you
but
he
could
not
bear
to
feel
that
you
were
there
if
i
asked
any
questions
about
the
people
up
above
us
his
face
grew
dark
he
gave
no
answer
and
continued
quite
silent
for
a
long
time
afterwards
but
when
he
perceived
that
not
content
with
the
old
domain
you
seemed
to
think
of
encroaching
upon
his
then
indeed
his
anger
burst
forth
he
swore
that
were
you
to
succeed
in
reaching
the
new
mine
you
should
assuredly
perish
notwithstanding
his
great
age
his
strength
is
astonishing
and
his
threats
used
to
make
me
go
on
nell
my
child
said
simon
to
the
girl
who
paused
as
though
to
collect
her
thoughts
on
the
occasion
of
your
first
attempt
resumed
nell
as
soon
as
my
grandfather
saw
that
you
were
fairly
inside
the
gallery
leading
to
new
aberfoyle
he
stopped
up
the
opening
and
turned
it
into
a
prison
for
you
i
only
knew
you
as
shadows
dimly
seen
in
the
gloom
of
the
pit
but
i
could
not
endure
the
idea
that
you
would
die
of
hunger
in
these
horrid
places
and
so
at
the
risk
of
being
detected
i
succeeded
in
obtaining
bread
and
water
for
you
during
some
days
i
should
have
liked
to
help
you
to
escape
but
it
was
so
difficult
to
avoid
the
vigilance
of
my
grandfather
you
were
about
to
die
then
arrived
jack
ryan
and
the
others
by
the
providence
of
god
i
met
with
them
and
instantly
guided
them
to
where
you
were
when
my
grandfather
discovered
what
i
had
done
his
rage
against
me
was
terrible
i
expected
death
at
his
hands
after
that
my
life
became
insupportable
to
me
my
grandfather
completely
lost
his
senses
he
proclaimed
himself
king
of
darkness
and
flame
and
when
he
heard
your
tools
at
work
on
which
he
considered
entirely
his
own
he
became
furious
and
beat
me
cruelly
i
would
have
fled
from
him
but
it
was
impossible
so
narrowly
did
he
watch
me
at
last
in
a
fit
of
ungovernable
fury
he
threw
me
down
into
the
abyss
where
you
found
me
and
disappeared
vainly
calling
on
harfang
which
faithfully
stayed
by
me
to
follow
him
i
know
not
how
long
i
remained
there
but
i
felt
i
was
at
the
point
of
death
when
you
my
harry
came
and
saved
me
but
now
you
all
see
that
the
grandchild
of
old
silfax
can
never
be
the
wife
of
harry
ford
because
it
would
be
certain
death
to
you
all
nell
cried
harry
no
continued
the
maiden
my
resolution
is
taken
by
one
means
only
can
your
ruin
be
averted
i
must
return
to
my
grandfather
he
threatens
to
destroy
the
whole
of
new
aberfoyle
his
is
a
soul
incapable
of
mercy
or
forgiveness
and
no
mortal
can
say
to
what
horrid
deed
the
spirit
of
revenge
will
lead
him
my
duty
is
clear
i
should
be
the
most
despicable
creature
on
earth
did
i
hesitate
to
perform
it
farewell
i
thank
you
all
heartily
you
only
have
taught
me
what
happiness
is
whatever
may
befall
believe
that
my
whole
heart
remains
with
at
these
words
simon
madge
and
harry
started
up
in
an
agony
of
grief
exclaiming
in
tones
of
despair
what
nell
is
it
possible
you
would
leave
us
james
starr
put
them
all
aside
with
an
air
of
authority
and
going
straight
up
to
nell
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
saying
quietly
very
right
my
child
you
have
said
exactly
what
you
ought
to
say
and
now
listen
to
what
we
have
to
say
in
reply
we
shall
not
let
you
go
away
if
necessary
we
shall
keep
you
by
force
do
you
think
we
could
be
so
base
as
to
accept
of
your
generous
proposal
these
threats
of
silfax
are
formidable
no
doubt
about
it
but
after
all
a
man
is
but
a
man
and
we
can
take
precautions
you
will
tell
us
will
you
not
even
for
his
own
sake
all
you
can
about
his
habits
and
his
all
we
want
to
do
is
to
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
do
harm
and
perhaps
bring
him
to
you
want
to
do
what
is
quite
impossible
said
nell
my
grandfather
is
everywhere
and
nowhere
i
have
never
seen
his
retreats
i
have
never
seen
him
sleep
if
he
meant
to
conceal
himself
he
used
to
leave
me
alone
and
vanish
when
i
took
my
resolution
starr
i
was
aware
of
everything
you
could
say
against
it
believe
me
there
is
but
one
way
to
render
silfax
powerless
and
that
will
be
by
my
return
to
him
invisible
himself
he
sees
everything
that
goes
on
just
think
whether
it
is
likely
he
could
discover
your
very
thoughts
and
intentions
from
that
time
when
the
letter
was
written
to
starr
up
to
now
that
my
marriage
with
harry
has
been
arranged
if
he
did
not
possess
the
extraordinary
faculty
of
knowing
everything
as
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
my
grandfather
in
his
very
insanity
is
a
man
of
most
powerful
mind
he
formerly
used
to
talk
to
me
on
very
lofty
subjects
he
taught
me
the
existence
of
god
and
never
deceived
me
but
on
one
point
which
was
that
he
made
me
believe
that
all
men
were
base
and
perfidious
because
he
wished
to
inspire
me
with
his
own
hatred
of
all
the
human
race
when
harry
brought
me
to
the
cottage
you
thought
i
was
simply
ignorant
of
mankind
but
far
beyond
that
i
was
in
mortal
fear
of
you
all
ah
forgive
me
i
assure
you
for
many
days
i
believed
myself
in
the
power
of
wicked
wretches
and
i
longed
to
escape
you
madge
first
led
me
to
perceive
the
truth
not
by
anything
you
said
but
by
the
sight
of
your
daily
life
for
i
saw
that
your
husband
and
son
loved
and
respected
you
then
all
these
good
and
happy
workmen
who
so
revere
and
trust
starr
i
used
to
think
they
were
slaves
and
when
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
whole
population
of
aberfoyle
come
to
church
and
kneel
down
to
pray
to
god
and
praise
him
for
his
infinite
goodness
i
said
to
myself
my
grandfather
has
deceived
but
now
enlightened
by
all
you
have
taught
me
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
himself
is
deceived
i
mean
to
return
to
the
secret
passages
i
formerly
frequented
with
him
he
is
certain
to
be
on
the
watch
i
will
call
to
him
he
will
hear
me
and
who
knows
but
that
by
returning
to
him
i
may
be
able
to
bring
him
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
the
maiden
spoke
without
interruption
for
all
felt
that
it
was
good
for
her
to
open
her
whole
heart
to
her
friends
but
when
exhausted
by
emotion
and
with
eyes
full
of
tears
she
ceased
speaking
harry
turned
to
old
madge
and
said
mother
what
should
you
think
of
the
man
who
could
forsake
the
noble
girl
whose
words
you
have
been
listening
to
i
should
think
he
was
a
base
coward
said
madge
and
were
he
my
son
i
should
renounce
and
curse
nell
do
you
hear
what
our
mother
says
resumed
harry
wherever
you
go
i
will
follow
you
if
you
persist
in
leaving
us
we
will
go
away
harry
harry
cried
nell
overcome
by
her
feelings
the
girl
s
lips
blanched
and
she
sank
into
the
arms
of
madge
who
begged
she
might
be
left
alone
with
her
chapter
xviii
nell
s
wedding
it
was
agreed
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
cottage
must
keep
more
on
their
guard
than
ever
the
threats
of
old
silfax
were
too
serious
to
be
disregarded
it
was
only
too
possible
that
he
possessed
some
terrible
means
by
which
the
whole
of
aberfoyle
might
be
annihilated
armed
sentinels
were
posted
at
the
various
entrances
to
the
mine
with
orders
to
keep
strict
watch
day
and
night
any
stranger
entering
the
mine
was
brought
before
james
starr
that
he
might
give
an
account
of
himself
there
being
no
fear
of
treason
among
the
inhabitants
of
coal
town
the
threatened
danger
to
the
subterranean
colony
was
made
known
to
them
nell
was
informed
of
all
the
precautions
taken
and
became
more
tranquil
although
she
was
not
free
from
uneasiness
harry
s
determination
to
follow
her
wherever
she
went
compelled
her
to
promise
not
to
escape
from
her
friends
during
the
week
preceding
the
wedding
no
accident
whatever
occurred
in
aberfoyle
the
system
of
watching
was
carefully
maintained
but
the
miners
began
to
recover
from
the
panic
which
had
seriously
interrupted
the
work
of
excavation
james
starr
continued
to
look
out
for
silfax
the
old
man
having
vindictively
declared
that
nell
should
never
marry
simon
s
son
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
he
would
not
hesitate
to
commit
any
violent
deed
which
would
hinder
their
union
the
examination
of
the
mine
was
carried
on
minutely
every
passage
and
gallery
was
searched
up
to
those
higher
ranges
which
opened
out
among
the
ruins
of
dundonald
castle
it
was
rightly
supposed
that
through
this
old
building
silfax
passed
out
to
obtain
what
was
needful
for
the
support
of
his
miserable
existence
which
he
must
have
done
either
by
purchasing
or
thieving
as
to
the
james
starr
began
to
think
that
appearance
must
have
been
produced
by
some
jet
of
gas
which
issuing
from
that
part
of
the
pit
could
be
lighted
by
silfax
he
was
not
far
wrong
but
all
search
for
proof
of
this
was
fruitless
and
the
continued
strain
of
anxiety
in
this
perpetual
effort
to
detect
a
malignant
and
invisible
being
rendered
the
engineer
outwardly
calm
an
unhappy
man
as
the
approached
his
dread
of
some
catastrophe
increased
and
he
could
not
but
speak
of
it
to
the
old
overman
whose
uneasiness
soon
more
than
equaled
his
own
at
length
the
day
came
silfax
had
given
no
token
of
existence
by
daybreak
the
entire
population
of
coal
town
was
astir
work
was
suspended
overseers
and
workmen
alike
desired
to
do
honor
to
simon
ford
and
his
son
they
all
felt
they
owed
a
large
debt
of
gratitude
to
these
bold
and
persevering
men
by
whose
means
the
mine
had
been
restored
to
its
former
prosperity
the
ceremony
was
to
take
place
at
eleven
o
clock
in
giles
s
chapel
which
stood
on
the
shores
of
loch
malcolm
at
the
appointed
time
harry
left
the
cottage
supporting
his
mother
on
his
arm
while
simon
led
the
bride
following
them
came
starr
the
engineer
composed
in
manner
but
in
reality
nerved
to
expect
the
worst
and
jack
ryan
stepping
superb
in
full
highland
piper
s
costume
then
came
the
other
mining
engineers
the
principal
people
of
coal
town
the
friends
and
comrades
of
the
old
overman
every
member
of
this
great
family
of
miners
forming
the
population
of
new
aberfoyle
in
the
outer
world
the
day
was
one
of
the
hottest
of
the
month
of
august
peculiarly
oppressive
in
northern
countries
the
sultry
air
penetrated
the
depths
of
the
coal
mine
and
elevated
the
temperature
the
air
which
entered
through
the
ventilating
shafts
and
the
great
tunnel
of
loch
malcolm
was
charged
with
electricity
and
the
barometer
it
was
afterwards
remarked
had
fallen
in
a
remarkable
manner
there
was
indeed
every
indication
that
a
storm
might
burst
forth
beneath
the
rocky
vault
which
formed
the
roof
of
the
enormous
crypt
of
the
very
mine
itself
but
the
inhabitants
were
not
at
that
moment
troubling
themselves
about
the
chances
of
atmospheric
disturbance
above
ground
everybody
as
a
matter
of
course
had
put
on
his
best
clothes
for
the
occasion
madge
was
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
days
gone
by
wearing
the
toy
and
the
rokelay
or
tartan
plaid
of
matrons
of
the
olden
time
old
simon
wore
a
coat
of
which
bailie
nicol
jarvie
himself
would
have
approved
nell
had
resolved
to
show
nothing
of
her
mental
agitation
she
forbade
her
heart
to
beat
or
her
inward
terrors
to
betray
themselves
and
the
brave
girl
appeared
before
all
with
a
calm
and
collected
aspect
she
had
declined
every
ornament
of
dress
and
the
very
simplicity
of
her
attire
added
to
the
charming
elegance
of
her
appearance
her
hair
was
bound
with
the
snood
the
usual
of
scottish
maidens
all
proceeded
towards
giles
s
chapel
which
had
been
handsomely
decorated
for
the
occasion
the
electric
discs
of
light
which
illuminated
coal
town
blazed
like
so
many
suns
a
luminous
atmosphere
pervaded
new
aberfoyle
in
the
chapel
electric
lamps
shed
a
glow
over
the
windows
which
shone
like
fiery
kaleidoscopes
at
the
porch
of
the
chapel
the
minister
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
wedding
party
it
approached
after
having
passed
in
stately
procession
along
the
shore
of
loch
malcolm
then
the
tones
of
the
organ
were
heard
and
preceded
by
the
minister
the
group
advanced
into
the
chapel
the
divine
blessing
was
first
invoked
on
all
present
then
harry
and
nell
remained
alone
before
the
minister
who
holding
the
sacred
book
in
his
hand
proceeded
to
say
harry
will
you
take
nell
to
be
your
wife
and
will
you
promise
to
love
her
always
i
promise
answered
the
young
man
in
a
firm
and
steady
voice
and
you
nell
continued
the
minister
will
you
take
harry
to
be
your
husband
and
before
he
could
finish
the
sentence
a
prodigious
noise
resounded
from
without
one
of
the
enormous
rocks
on
which
was
formed
the
terrace
overhanging
the
banks
of
loch
malcolm
had
suddenly
given
way
and
opened
without
explosion
disclosing
a
profound
abyss
into
which
the
waters
were
now
wildly
plunging
in
another
instant
among
the
shattered
rocks
and
rushing
waves
appeared
a
canoe
which
a
vigorous
arm
propelled
along
the
surface
of
the
lake
in
the
canoe
was
seen
the
figure
of
an
old
man
standing
upright
he
was
clothed
in
a
dark
mantle
his
hair
was
dishevelled
a
long
white
beard
fell
over
his
breast
and
in
his
hand
he
bore
a
lighted
davy
safety
lamp
the
flame
being
protected
by
the
metallic
gauze
of
the
apparatus
in
a
loud
voice
this
old
man
shouted
the
is
upon
you
woe
woe
betide
ye
all
at
the
same
moment
the
slight
smell
peculiar
to
carburetted
hydrogen
was
perceptibly
diffused
through
the
atmosphere
and
in
truth
the
fall
of
the
rock
had
made
a
passage
of
escape
for
an
enormous
quantity
of
explosive
gas
accumulated
in
vast
cavities
the
openings
to
which
had
hitherto
been
blocked
up
jets
and
streams
of
the
now
rose
upward
in
the
vaulted
dome
and
well
did
that
fierce
old
man
know
that
the
consequence
of
what
he
had
done
would
be
to
render
explosive
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
mine
james
starr
and
several
others
having
hastily
quitted
the
chapel
and
perceived
the
imminence
of
the
danger
now
rushed
back
crying
out
in
accents
of
the
utmost
alarm
fly
from
the
mine
fly
instantly
from
the
mine
now
for
the
here
comes
the
yelled
the
old
man
urging
his
canoe
further
along
the
lake
harry
with
his
bride
his
father
and
his
mother
left
the
chapel
in
haste
and
in
terror
fly
fly
for
your
lives
repeated
james
starr
alas
it
was
too
late
to
fly
old
silfax
stood
there
prepared
to
fulfill
his
last
dreadful
threat
prepared
to
stop
the
marriage
of
nell
and
harry
by
overwhelming
the
entire
population
of
the
place
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
coal
mine
as
he
stood
ready
to
accomplish
this
act
of
vengeance
his
enormous
owl
whose
white
plumage
was
marked
with
black
spots
was
seen
hovering
directly
above
his
head
at
that
moment
a
man
flung
himself
into
the
waters
of
the
lake
and
swam
vigorously
towards
the
canoe
it
was
jack
ryan
fully
determined
to
reach
the
madman
before
he
could
do
the
dreadful
deed
of
destruction
silfax
saw
him
coming
instantly
he
smashed
the
glass
of
his
lamp
and
snatching
out
the
burning
wick
waved
it
in
the
air
silence
like
death
fell
upon
the
astounded
multitude
james
starr
in
the
calmness
of
despair
marvelled
that
the
inevitable
explosion
was
even
for
a
moment
delayed
silfax
gazing
upwards
with
wild
and
contracted
features
appeared
to
become
aware
that
the
gas
lighter
than
the
lower
atmosphere
was
accumulating
far
up
under
the
dome
and
at
a
sign
from
him
the
owl
seizing
in
its
claw
the
lighted
match
soared
upwards
to
the
vaulted
roof
towards
which
the
madman
pointed
with
outstretched
arm
another
second
and
new
aberfoyle
would
be
no
more
suddenly
nell
sprang
from
harry
s
arms
and
with
a
bright
look
of
inspiration
she
ran
to
the
very
brink
of
the
waters
of
the
lake
harfang
harfang
cried
she
in
a
clear
voice
here
come
to
me
the
faithful
bird
surprised
appeared
to
hesitate
in
its
flight
presently
recognizing
nell
s
voice
it
dropped
the
burning
match
into
the
water
and
describing
a
wide
circle
flew
downwards
alighting
at
the
maiden
s
feet
then
a
terrible
cry
echoed
through
the
vaulted
roofs
it
was
the
last
sound
uttered
by
old
silfax
just
as
jack
ryan
laid
his
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
canoe
the
old
man
foiled
in
his
purpose
of
revenge
cast
himself
headlong
into
the
waters
of
the
lake
save
him
oh
save
him
shrieked
nell
in
a
voice
of
agony
immediately
harry
plunged
into
the
water
and
swimming
towards
jack
ryan
he
dived
repeatedly
but
his
efforts
were
useless
the
waters
of
loch
malcolm
yielded
not
their
prey
they
closed
forever
over
silfax
chapter
xix
the
legend
of
old
silfax
six
months
after
these
events
the
marriage
so
strangely
interrupted
was
finally
celebrated
in
giles
s
chapel
and
the
young
couple
who
still
wore
mourning
garments
returned
to
the
cottage
james
starr
and
simon
ford
henceforth
free
from
the
anxieties
which
had
so
long
distressed
them
joyously
presided
over
the
entertainment
which
followed
the
ceremony
and
prolonged
it
to
the
following
day
on
this
memorable
occasion
jack
ryan
in
his
favorite
character
of
piper
and
in
all
the
glory
of
full
dress
blew
up
his
chanter
and
astonished
the
company
by
the
unheard
of
achievement
of
playing
singing
and
dancing
all
at
once
it
is
needless
to
say
that
harry
and
nell
were
happy
these
loving
hearts
after
the
trials
they
had
gone
through
found
in
their
union
the
happiness
they
deserved
as
to
simon
ford
the
of
new
aberfoyle
he
began
to
talk
of
celebrating
his
golden
wedding
after
fifty
years
of
marriage
with
good
old
madge
who
liked
the
idea
immensely
herself
and
after
that
why
not
golden
wedding
number
two
you
would
like
a
couple
of
fifties
would
you
simon
said
jack
ryan
all
right
my
boy
replied
the
overman
quietly
i
see
nothing
against
it
in
this
fine
climate
of
ours
and
living
far
from
the
luxury
and
intemperance
of
the
outer
will
the
dwellers
in
coal
town
ever
be
called
to
witness
this
second
ceremony
time
will
show
certainly
the
strange
bird
of
old
silfax
seemed
destined
to
attain
a
wonderful
longevity
the
harfang
continued
to
haunt
the
gloomy
recesses
of
the
cave
after
the
old
man
s
death
nell
had
attempted
to
keep
the
owl
but
in
a
very
few
days
he
flew
away
he
evidently
disliked
human
society
as
much
as
his
master
had
done
and
besides
that
he
appeared
to
have
a
particular
spite
against
harry
the
jealous
bird
seemed
to
remember
and
hate
him
for
having
carried
off
nell
from
the
deep
abyss
notwithstanding
all
he
could
do
to
prevent
him
still
at
long
intervals
nell
would
see
the
creature
hovering
above
loch
malcolm
could
he
possibly
be
watching
for
his
friend
of
yore
did
he
strive
to
pierce
with
keen
eye
the
depths
which
had
engulfed
his
master
the
history
of
the
harfang
became
legendary
and
furnished
jack
ryan
with
many
a
tale
and
song
thanks
to
him
the
story
of
old
silfax
and
his
bird
will
long
be
preserved
and
handed
down
to
future
generations
of
the
scottish
peasantry
