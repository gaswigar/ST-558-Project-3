anthony
parker
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
creaking
old
dock
his
daughter
penny
who
stood
in
the
shadow
of
a
shed
out
of
the
hot
afternoon
sun
grinned
at
him
with
good
humor
and
understanding
oh
take
it
easy
dad
she
advised
after
all
this
is
a
vacation
and
we
have
two
weeks
before
us
is
the
river
beautiful
what
beautiful
about
it
her
father
growled
however
he
turned
to
gaze
at
a
zigzag
group
of
sailboats
tacking
gracefully
along
the
far
rippled
shore
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
a
ferryboat
churned
the
blue
water
to
whip
cream
foam
as
it
steamed
upstream
are
you
certain
this
is
the
dock
where
we
were
to
meet
mr
gandiss
penny
asked
after
a
moment
it
seems
queer
he
would
fail
us
for
nearly
five
now
we
waited
almost
an
hour
ceasing
the
restless
pacing
parker
publisher
of
the
a
daily
newspaper
searched
his
pockets
and
found
a
crumpled
letter
reviewing
it
at
a
glance
he
said
four
was
the
hour
gandiss
promised
to
meet
us
at
dock
fourteen
this
is
number
fourteen
penny
confirmed
pointing
to
the
numbers
plainly
visible
on
the
shed
obviously
something
happened
to
gandiss
perhaps
he
forgot
a
nice
thing
muttered
the
publisher
here
he
invites
us
to
spend
two
weeks
at
his
island
home
and
then
fails
to
meet
us
does
he
expect
us
to
swim
to
the
island
penny
a
slim
girl
with
shoulder
length
bob
which
the
wind
tossed
about
at
will
wandered
to
the
edge
of
the
dock
that
must
be
shadow
island
over
there
she
observed
indicating
a
dot
of
green
land
which
arched
from
the
water
like
the
curving
back
of
a
turtle
it
must
be
nearly
a
mile
away
the
question
is
how
much
longer
are
we
to
wait
parker
glanced
again
at
his
watch
it
starting
to
cloud
up
and
may
rain
in
another
half
hour
why
not
taxi
into
town
what
the
name
of
this
dump
anyhow
our
tickets
read
beach
well
tate
beach
must
do
without
us
this
summer
parker
snapped
picking
up
his
suitcase
i
had
my
fill
of
this
we
spend
the
night
in
a
hotel
then
start
for
riverview
on
the
early
morning
train
do
you
know
gandiss
well
penny
inquired
stalling
for
time
he
advertises
in
the
and
we
played
golf
together
occasionally
when
he
came
to
riverview
i
must
have
been
crazy
to
accept
an
invitation
to
come
here
oh
we
have
a
good
time
if
only
we
can
get
to
the
island
dad
i
ca
figure
out
exactly
why
gandiss
invited
us
parker
added
thoughtfully
he
has
something
in
mind
besides
entertainment
but
what
it
is
i
have
been
able
to
guess
how
about
hiring
a
boat
penny
suggested
her
father
debated
then
shook
his
head
no
if
gandiss
does
think
enough
of
his
guests
to
meet
them
then
he
can
do
without
us
come
on
we
leaving
never
noted
for
an
even
temper
or
patience
the
publisher
strode
down
the
dock
wait
dad
penny
called
excitedly
i
think
someone
may
be
coming
for
us
now
a
mahogany
motorboat
with
glittering
brasswork
approached
at
high
speed
from
the
direction
of
shadow
island
as
penny
and
her
father
hopefully
watched
it
swerved
toward
their
dock
and
the
motor
was
throttled
that
not
gandiss
the
publisher
said
observing
a
freckled
youth
at
the
steering
wheel
nevertheless
suitcase
in
hand
he
waited
for
the
boat
the
craft
came
in
smoothly
and
the
young
man
at
the
wheel
leaped
out
and
made
fast
to
a
dock
post
you
anthony
parker
he
exclaimed
greeting
penny
father
and
bestowing
an
apologetic
smile
upon
them
both
i
jack
jack
gandiss
harvey
gandiss
son
parker
inquired
his
annoyance
melting
a
chip
off
the
old
block
the
boy
grinned
hope
i
have
kept
you
waiting
long
well
we
had
just
about
given
up
parker
admitted
truthfully
i
sure
sorry
sir
i
promised
my
father
i
would
meet
you
sharp
at
four
fact
is
i
was
out
on
the
river
with
some
friends
and
realize
how
late
it
was
we
were
practicing
for
the
trophy
sailboat
race
penny
blue
eyes
sparkled
with
interest
an
excellent
swimmer
she
too
enjoyed
sailing
and
all
water
sports
however
she
had
never
competed
in
a
race
suppose
we
get
along
to
the
island
parker
interposed
glancing
at
the
sky
i
do
like
the
look
of
those
clouds
oh
it
wo
rain
for
hours
jack
said
carelessly
those
clouds
are
moving
slowly
and
we
reach
the
island
within
ten
minutes
helping
penny
and
parker
into
the
motorboat
he
stowed
the
luggage
under
the
seat
and
then
cast
off
in
a
sweeping
circle
the
craft
sped
past
a
canbuoy
which
marked
a
shoal
and
out
into
the
swift
current
penny
held
tightly
to
her
straw
hat
to
keep
it
from
being
blown
downstream
a
stiff
breeze
churned
the
waves
which
spanked
hard
against
the
bow
of
the
boat
my
father
was
sorry
he
could
meet
you
himself
jack
hurled
at
them
above
the
whistle
of
the
wind
he
was
held
up
at
the
airplane
factory
labor
trouble
or
something
of
the
sort
parker
nodded
his
good
humor
entirely
restored
settling
comfortably
in
the
leather
seat
he
focused
his
gaze
on
distant
shadow
island
good
fishing
around
here
he
inquired
the
best
ever
you
like
it
sir
jack
was
nearly
seventeen
with
light
hair
and
steel
blue
eyes
his
white
trousers
were
none
too
well
pressed
and
the
sleeves
of
an
old
sweater
bore
smears
of
grease
steering
the
boat
with
control
he
deliberately
cut
through
the
highest
of
the
waves
treating
his
passengers
to
a
series
of
jolts
some
distance
away
a
ferryboat
the
glided
smoothly
along
its
railings
thronged
with
people
in
the
pilot
house
a
girl
who
might
have
been
sixteen
stood
at
the
wheel
look
dad
penny
exclaimed
a
girl
is
handling
that
big
boat
sally
barker
jack
informed
disparagingly
she
the
daughter
of
captain
barker
who
owns
the
a
brat
if
ever
there
was
one
she
certainly
has
that
ferryboat
eating
out
of
her
hand
parker
commented
admiringly
oh
she
handles
a
boat
well
enough
why
should
she
the
captain
started
teaching
her
about
the
river
when
she
was
only
three
years
old
he
taught
her
all
she
knows
about
sailboat
racing
too
jack
tone
of
voice
left
no
doubt
that
he
considered
sally
barker
completely
beneath
his
notice
as
the
two
boats
drew
fairly
close
together
the
girl
in
the
pilot
house
waved
but
he
pretended
not
to
see
you
said
something
about
a
sailboat
race
when
we
were
at
the
dock
penny
reminded
him
eagerly
is
it
an
annual
affair
jack
nodded
swerving
to
avoid
a
floating
log
sally
won
the
trophy
last
year
before
that
i
held
it
this
year
i
am
planning
on
winning
it
back
oh
i
see
penny
commented
dryly
that
not
why
i
dislike
sally
jack
said
to
correct
any
misapprehension
she
might
have
gained
it
just
well
she
so
sure
of
herself
so
blamed
stubborn
and
it
an
insult
to
tate
beach
the
way
she
flaunts
the
trophy
aboard
that
cheap
old
ferryboat
how
do
you
mean
parker
inquired
his
curiosity
aroused
jack
did
not
reply
for
just
then
the
engine
coughed
the
boat
plowed
on
a
few
feet
and
the
motor
cut
off
again
now
what
jack
exclaimed
alarmed
even
as
he
spoke
the
engine
died
completely
sounds
to
me
as
if
we
out
of
gas
observed
parker
how
is
your
supply
a
stricken
look
came
upon
jack
face
i
forgot
to
fill
the
tank
before
i
left
the
island
he
confessed
ruefully
my
father
told
me
to
be
sure
to
do
it
but
i
started
off
in
such
a
hurry
have
you
an
extra
can
of
fuel
aboard
parker
asked
trying
to
hide
his
annoyance
jack
shook
his
head
gazing
gloomily
toward
the
distant
island
the
current
had
caught
the
boat
and
was
carrying
it
downstream
away
from
the
gandiss
estate
nothing
to
do
then
but
get
out
the
oars
and
it
will
be
a
long
hard
row
oars
jack
echoed
weakly
we
have
any
aboard
and
no
anchor
either
parker
was
too
disgusted
to
speak
a
man
who
demanded
efficiency
and
responsibility
in
his
own
newspaper
plant
he
had
no
patience
with
those
negligent
of
their
duties
because
he
and
penny
were
to
be
guests
of
the
gandiss
family
he
made
an
effort
not
to
blame
jack
for
the
mishap
i
i
terribly
sorry
the
boy
stammered
but
we
should
be
stranded
here
long
we
soon
be
picked
up
hopefully
jack
gazed
toward
the
nearest
shore
no
small
boats
were
visible
the
ferry
plying
her
regular
passenger
route
now
was
far
upstream
although
the
sun
still
shone
brightly
clouds
frequently
blocked
it
from
view
waves
slapped
higher
against
the
drifting
boat
and
the
river
took
on
a
dark
cast
neither
penny
nor
her
father
spoke
of
the
increasing
certainty
of
rain
however
they
watched
the
shifting
clouds
uneasily
soon
there
was
no
more
sun
and
the
river
waters
became
inky
black
presently
the
wind
died
completely
and
a
dead
calm
held
the
boat
but
not
for
many
minutes
soon
a
ripple
of
breeze
ruffled
the
water
and
far
upstream
a
haze
of
rain
blotted
out
the
shoreline
here
it
comes
parker
said
tersely
buttoning
up
his
coat
the
next
instant
wind
and
rain
struck
the
little
boat
in
full
force
penny
hat
was
swept
from
her
head
and
went
sailing
gaily
down
river
waves
which
broke
higher
and
higher
spanked
the
boat
threatening
to
overturn
it
when
they
struck
broadside
if
we
just
had
an
anchor
jack
murmured
but
did
not
finish
above
the
fury
of
the
storm
could
be
heard
the
faint
clatter
of
a
motorboat
engine
straining
their
eyes
they
pierced
the
wall
of
rain
to
see
a
small
speedboat
fighting
its
way
upstream
a
boat
penny
cried
now
we
be
picked
up
jack
sprang
to
his
feet
waving
and
shouting
closer
and
closer
approached
the
boat
but
there
was
no
answering
shout
from
those
aboard
parker
penny
and
jack
yelled
in
unison
they
thought
for
a
moment
that
the
occupants
must
have
heard
their
cries
and
would
come
to
the
rescue
but
the
craft
did
not
change
course
keeping
steadily
on
it
passed
the
drifting
motorboat
well
to
starboard
and
disappeared
into
the
curtain
of
rain
chapter
brass
the
rain
dashed
into
penny
face
and
ran
in
rivulets
down
her
neck
with
a
change
in
the
wind
direction
the
air
had
become
suddenly
cold
shivering
she
huddled
close
to
her
father
for
warmth
veiled
by
rain
the
shore
no
longer
was
visible
far
to
the
right
the
chug
of
a
laboring
motorboat
was
heard
for
an
instant
then
died
away
it
was
apparent
to
penny
that
they
were
drifting
downstream
quite
rapidly
listen
she
cried
a
moment
later
from
upriver
had
come
three
sharp
blasts
of
a
whistle
that
the
muttered
jack
tossing
a
lock
of
wet
hair
out
of
his
eyes
we
must
be
right
in
her
path
then
maybe
we
be
picked
up
penny
exclaimed
hopefully
jack
gave
a
snort
of
disgust
i
rather
drown
than
accept
help
from
sally
barker
would
she
gloat
young
man
interposed
parker
with
emphasis
this
is
no
time
for
false
pride
we
in
a
predicament
and
will
welcome
help
from
any
source
yes
sir
i
guess
you
right
murmured
jack
completely
squelched
i
sure
am
sorry
about
getting
you
into
this
mess
gazing
through
the
curtain
of
driving
rain
penny
tried
to
glimpse
the
suddenly
she
distinguished
its
high
decks
and
was
dismayed
to
see
that
the
ferry
was
bearing
at
full
speed
directly
toward
the
drifting
motorboat
jack
leaped
to
his
feet
frantically
waving
his
arms
realizing
the
danger
of
being
run
down
parker
likewise
sprang
up
shouting
straight
on
came
the
her
pilot
seemingly
unaware
of
the
little
boat
low
in
the
water
and
directly
in
the
path
they
do
see
us
jack
shouted
hoarsely
we
be
run
down
the
ferryboat
now
was
very
close
its
dark
hull
loomed
up
expecting
a
splintering
crash
penny
struggled
to
her
feet
preparing
to
jump
overboard
but
instead
she
heard
a
series
of
sharp
whistle
toots
and
the
ferryboat
swerved
missing
them
by
a
scant
three
yards
wow
was
that
close
jack
muttered
collapsing
weakly
on
the
seat
then
he
straightened
up
again
into
alert
attention
for
the
ferry
had
reduced
speed
maybe
we
going
to
be
picked
up
he
exclaimed
the
ferryboat
indeed
had
maneuvered
so
that
the
current
would
swing
the
drifting
craft
directly
toward
it
five
minutes
later
wet
and
bedraggled
the
three
stranded
sailors
scrambled
up
a
lowered
ladder
onto
the
slippery
deck
a
few
curious
passengers
who
braved
the
rain
stared
curiously
at
them
as
they
sought
shelter
well
if
it
is
jack
gandiss
and
in
trouble
again
boomed
captain
barker
owner
of
the
ferry
he
was
a
short
stubby
man
with
twinkling
blue
eyes
what
happened
this
time
engine
conk
out
we
ran
out
of
gas
the
boy
admitted
briefly
thanks
for
picking
us
up
better
thank
sally
here
replied
the
captain
giving
orders
for
the
motorboat
to
be
taken
in
tow
it
was
her
sharp
eyes
that
picked
you
up
out
o
the
storm
penny
turned
to
see
a
girl
of
her
own
age
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
pilot
house
in
oilskin
hat
and
coat
one
easily
might
have
mistaken
her
for
a
boy
impatiently
she
brushed
aside
a
strand
of
wet
hair
which
straggled
from
beneath
the
ugly
headgear
and
came
out
on
the
deck
well
well
if
it
is
jack
she
chortled
enjoying
the
discomfiture
imagine
an
old
tar
like
you
running
out
of
gas
never
mind
the
cracks
he
retorted
grimly
just
go
back
to
your
knitting
turning
her
back
upon
jack
sally
studied
penny
with
curious
interest
do
i
know
you
she
inquired
my
father
and
i
are
to
be
guests
at
the
gandiss
home
penny
explained
volunteering
their
names
we
were
on
our
way
to
shadow
island
when
we
ran
out
of
gas
let
not
go
into
all
the
gory
details
here
jack
broke
in
getting
wet
you
mean
you
all
wet
corrected
sally
grinning
sally

barker

with
high
good
humor
i

the
wheel

on

run

how
about

off
at
the
island
jack
inquired
if
we
had
some
gasoline
we
take
care
of
you
on
the
return
trip
the
captain
promised
no
time
now
we
have
a
hundred
passengers
to
unload
at
osage
penny
followed
sally
along
the
wet
deck
to
a
companionway
and
down
the
stairs
to
the
private
quarters
of
the
captain
and
his
daughter
osage

briefly

hour

jupiter
the
cabin
was
warm
and
cozy
though
cramped
in
space
sally
gave
parker
one
of
her
father
warm
sweaters
to
put
on
over
his
sodden
garments
offered
penny
a
complete
change
of
outer
clothing
and
deliberately
ignored
jack
needs
you
may
return
the
duds
later
she
said
leading
penny
to
an
adjoining
cabin
where
she
could
change
her
clothes
how
long
do
you
folks
expect
to
stay
at
shadow
island
two
weeks
probably
penny
wriggled
out
of
the
limp
dress
then
we
have
time
to
get
better
acquainted
you
be
here
for
the
trophy
race
too
sally
dark
eyes
danced
and
she
added
in
a
very
loud
voice
you
be
around
to
see
jack
get
licked
in
a
pig
eye
called
jack
through
the
thin
partition
of
the
cabin
why
that
old
sailboat
of
yours
is
just
a
mess
of
wormwood
it
was
fast
enough
to
win
the
brass
lantern
trophy
sally
challenged
winking
at
penny
in
a
whisper
she
explained
i
always
get
a
kick
out
of
tormenting
jack
he
so
cocky
and
sure
of
himself
it
does
him
good
to
be
taken
down
a
peg
tell
me
about
the
race
urged
penny
it
sounds
interesting
especially
your
feud
with
jack
later
promised
sally
carelessly
right
now
i
want
to
get
you
something
warm
to
drink
before
we
dock
at
osage
here
give
me
those
wet
clothes
i
dry
them
for
you
and
send
them
to
shadow
island
tomorrow
rejoining
jack
and
parker
the
captain
daughter
conducted
the
party
to
a
food
bar
in
the
passenger
lounge
hot
java
she
instructed
the
counter
man
and
what
will
you
have
to
go
with
it
hamburgers
or
dogs
this
is
on
the
house
make
mine
a
dog
with
plenty
of
mustard
laughed
penny
enjoying
the
girl
breezy
slang
nothing
for
me
except
coffee
said
jack
stiffly
i
pay
for
it
too
parker
decided
upon
a
hamburger
food
especially
the
steaming
hot
coffee
revived
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
trio
even
jack
thawed
slightly
in
his
attitude
toward
sally
sipping
the
brew
from
a
thick
china
mug
penny
gaze
roved
curiously
about
the
lounge
the
room
was
poorly
furnished
with
an
ancient
red
carpet
and
wicker
chairs
passengers
were
absorbed
with
newspapers
their
fretful
children
or
the
supply
of
ancient
magazines
the
lounge
however
was
scrupulously
clean
and
every
fixture
had
been
polished
until
it
shone
like
gold
sam
barker
whose
father
before
him
had
sailed
a
river
boat
was
an
able
efficient
captain
one
of
the
best
and
most
respected
on
the
waterfront
attached
to
an
overhead
beam
near
the
food
bar
swung
an
ancient
brass
lantern
the
body
was
hexagonal
in
shape
its
panes
of
glass
protected
by
bars
of
metal
a
ornamental
turret
was
covered
with
a
hood
from
which
was
attached
the
suspending
ring
that
lantern
came
from
an
old
whaling
boat
nearly
a
century
ago
sally
explained
for
many
years
it
was
kept
in
the
country
club
as
a
curio
then
two
seasons
ago
it
was
offered
as
a
trophy
in
the
annual
hat
island
sailboat
race
held
here
i
won
the
lantern
the
first
year
jack
contributed
he
pointed
to
his
name
and
the
date
engraved
on
the
trophy
base
the
second
year
i
upset
the
apple
cart
by
winning
sally
added
with
a
grin
the
race
next
week
will
decide
who
keeps
the
lantern
permanently
providing
it
is
stolen
first
jack
cut
in
pointedly
sally
why
must
you
be
so
stubborn
about
hanging
it
here
on
the
queen
every
tom
dick
and
harry
rides
this
old
tub
do
call
the
a
tub
drawled
sally
her
tone
warning
him
he
had
gone
far
enough
and
as
for
our
passengers
what
i
mean
jack
corrected
hastily
is
that
you
ca
vouch
for
the
honesty
of
every
person
who
rides
this
ferry
i
not
in
the
least
worried
about
the
lantern
being
stolen
sally
retorted
i
won
it
fairly
enough
did
i
yes
then
it
mine
to
display
as
i
choose
the
racing
committee
agreed
to
that
the
lantern
is
chained
to
a
beam
and
is
safe
enough
i
hope
so
jack
said
grimly
i
aim
to
win
it
back
and
i
do
want
to
see
it
do
a
disappearing
act
before
the
day
of
the
race
you
wo
sally
returned
shortly
i
accept
full
responsibility
so
let
me
do
the
worrying
a
signal
bell
tapped
several
times
a
warning
to
the
passengers
that
the
ferry
was
approaching
shore
as
those
aboard
began
to
gather
up
their
belongings
sally
buttoned
her
oilskin
coat
tightly
about
her
excuse
me
for
a
minute
she
said
to
penny
and
parker
i
got
to
help
pop
see
you
later
chapter
problem
penny
jack
and
parker
reached
the
deck
of
the
in
time
to
see
sally
leap
nimbly
across
a
wide
space
to
the
dock
there
she
looped
a
great
coil
of
rope
expertly
over
the
post
and
helped
get
the
gangplank
down
step
lively
she
urged
the
passengers
pleasantly
but
in
a
voice
crisp
with
authority
in
a
space
of
five
minutes
she
had
helped
an
old
man
on
crutches
found
a
child
who
had
become
separated
from
his
mother
and
refused
passage
to
three
young
men
who
sought
to
make
a
return
trip
on
the
ferry
sorry
this
is
the
end
of
the
line
she
told
them
firmly
our
last
trip
today
then
how
about
a
date
one
of
the
men
teased
sally
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
raising
the
gangplank
she
signalled
for
the
ferry
to
pull
away
sally
always
likes
to
put
on
a
show
jack
muttered
disapprovingly
to
watch
her
perform
one
would
think
she
were
the
captain
well
she
impresses
me
as
a
most
capable
young
lady
commented
parker
after
all
we
owe
our
rescue
to
her
and
captain
barker
taking
the
hint
jack
offered
no
further
disparaging
remarks
rain
had
ceased
to
fall
but
deep
shadows
blotted
out
the
river
shores
watching
from
the
railing
penny
saw
the
island
loom
up
a
dark
compact
mass
of
black
the
ferry
ca
land
there
she
inquired
in
surprise
jack
shook
his
head
shoals
he
explained
briefly
in
the
spring
during
the
flood
season
the
channel
is
fairly
safe
now
he
broke
off
and
turned
to
stare
toward
the
pilot
house
the
engines
had
been
stilled
and
the
ferry
was
drifting
in
toward
the
island
captain
barker
stood
by
his
wheel
silent
watchful
as
a
cat
by
george
jack
exclaimed
admiringly
the
old
boy
intends
to
take
her
in
through
the
shoals
but
it
a
risky
thing
to
do
it
is
necessary
asked
parker
deeply
concerned
after
all
already
caused
the
barkers
great
inconvenience
surely
there
is
no
need
for
them
to
risk
going
aground
just
to
put
us
off
at
the
island
captain
barker
could
give
us
a
little
gasoline
but
he
gets
a
big
kick
out
of
doing
it
this
way
jack
muttered
he
and
sally
both
like
to
show
off
it
would
surprise
me
if
the
old
boy
oversteps
himself
this
time
we
running
into
shoal
water
sally
evidently
worried
stationed
herself
at
the
bow
of
the
dropping
a
leadline
over
the
side
eight
and
a
half
feet
she
called
seven
and
we
never
make
it
jack
murmured
we
going
aground
now
even
as
he
spoke
the
ferryboat
grated
on
the
sandy
river
bottom
captain
barker
seemed
not
in
the
least
disturbed
let
have
it
he
shouted
through
the
speaking
tube
every
ounce
we
got
rasping
and
groaning
in
its
timbers
the
stout
little
ferryboat
ground
her
way
through
the
sand
for
one
terrifying
moment
it
seemed
that
she
had
wedged
herself
fast
but
she
shuddered
and
went
over
the
bar
into
deeper
water
sally
drew
a
long
sigh
of
relief
and
grinned
at
jack
i
knew
pop
could
make
it
she
chuckled
but
he
sure
had
me
scared
for
a
minute
that
was
a
remarkable
demonstration
of
piloting
parker
declared
are
we
in
safe
waters
now
yes
the
channel
is
deep
all
the
way
to
our
dock
jack
replied
i
guess
captain
barker
aims
to
dump
us
off
at
our
front
door
bells
jingled
again
the
engines
were
cut
and
the
ferry
drifted
up
to
shadow
island
wharf
while
parker
and
penny
were
thanking
captain
barker
sally
helped
jack
and
one
of
the
sailors
set
loose
the
towed
motorboat
their
loud
argumentative
voices
could
be
heard
from
the
stern
those
kids
scrap
like
a
dog
and
a
cat
when
they
together
chuckled
captain
barker
but
i
calculate
they
outgrow
it
when
they
a
little
older
at
least
i
hope
so
saying
a
reluctant
goodbye
parker
and
penny
tramped
ashore
and
with
jack
watched
until
the
had
safely
passed
the
shoal
and
was
well
out
in
the
main
channel
again
before
they
could
pick
up
the
luggage
an
elderly
man
came
hurriedly
down
a
flagstone
walk
from
the
brightly
lighted
house
on
the
knoll
mr
gandiss
exclaimed
anthony
parker
grasping
his
outstretched
hand
this
is
my
daughter
penelope
or
penny
everyone
calls
her
the
owner
of
shadow
island
greeted
the
girl
with
more
than
casual
interest
but
as
he
spoke
his
puzzled
gaze
followed
the
whose
lights
now
could
be
seen
far
upstream
i
may
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
dad
jack
said
before
his
father
could
request
an
explanation
we
ran
out
of
gas
and
the
picked
us
up
you
ran
out
of
gas
i
distinctly
recall
warning
you
this
afternoon
that
the
tank
would
need
to
be
refilled
i
forgot
jack
said
edging
away
before
his
father
could
reprimand
him
further
he
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
boathouse
gandiss
a
stout
pleasant
man
was
distressed
by
his
son
behavior
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
house
he
apologized
so
profusely
that
penny
and
her
father
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
oh
boys
will
be
boys
parker
declared
trying
to
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
no
harm
was
done
we
enjoyed
the
adventure
added
penny
sincerely
it
was
a
pleasure
to
meet
captain
barker
and
his
daughter
gandiss
refused
to
abandon
the
subject
jack
worries
me
he
confessed
ruefully
he
sixteen
now
almost
seventeen
but
in
some
respects
he
has
no
responsibility
he
an
only
child
and
i
am
afraid
my
wife
and
i
have
spoiled
him
jack
does
seem
to
get
along
with
sally
barker
very
well
penny
remarked
smiling
at
the
recollection
that
another
thing
nodded
the
island
owner
sally
is
a
fine
girl
and
smart
as
a
whip
jack
has
the
idea
that
because
she
is
the
product
of
a
finishing
school
she
is
beneath
notice
sally
likes
to
prick
holes
in
jack
inflated
ego
and
then
the
war
is
on
you
have
a
fine
son
parker
said
warmly
he
outgrow
all
these
ideas
i
hope
so
sighed
gandiss
i
certainly
do
his
expression
conveyed
the
impression
that
he
was
not
too
confident
the
gandiss
home
surrounded
by
shrubs
was
large
and
pretentious
at
the
front
there
was
a
long
narrow
terrace
which
caught
the
breeze
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
river
for
half
a
mile
in
either
direction
there
were
tennis
courts
at
the
rear
and
a
garden
i
glad
you
folks
will
be
here
for
the
annual
sailboat
race
gandiss
remarked
pausing
to
indicate
the
twinkling
shore
lights
across
the
water
if
it
were
daytime
you
could
see
the
entire
course
from
here
jack
is
to
race
a
new
boat
built
especially
for
him
sally
barker
is
his
chief
competitor
inquired
penny
yes
in
skill
they
are
about
equally
matched
i
should
say
they
take
their
feud
very
seriously
in
the
open
doorway
stood
gandiss
a
woman
not
yet
in
her
fifties
cordially
she
bade
the
newcomers
welcome
what
a
dreadful
time
you
must
have
had
out
on
the
river
she
said
sympathetically
the
storm
came
up
so
quickly
my
husband
would
have
met
you
himself
but
he
was
delayed
at
the
factory
a
servant
was
sent
for
the
luggage
and
effie
a
maid
conducted
penny
to
her
room
the
chamber
was
luxuriously
furnished
with
a
green
tiled
bath
adjoining
pulling
a
silken
cord
to
open
the
venetian
blinds
penny
saw
that
the
window
overlooked
the
river
she
breathed
deeply
of
the
damp
air
where
do
the
barkers
live
she
asked
effie
who
was
laying
out
embroidered
towels
wherever
it
suits
their
fancy
to
drop
anchor
miss
since
i
came
here
to
work
the
only
home
they
ever
have
had
was
aboard
their
ferryboat
the
luggage
soon
was
brought
up
and
effie
unpacked
carefully
hanging
up
each
garment
penny
inquired
if
she
would
have
time
for
a
hot
bath
oh
yes
miss
the
gandiss
never
dine
until
eight
i
will
draw
your
tub
pine
scent
or
violet
penny
swallowed
hard
and
nearly
lost
her
composure
make
it
pine
she
managed
and
omit
the
needles
exposure
to
rain
and
cold
had
stiffened
her
muscles
and
made
her
feel
thoroughly
miserable
however
after
fifteen
minutes
in
a
steaming
bath
she
felt
as
fresh
as
ever
her
golden
hair
curled
in
ringlets
tight
to
her
head
and
when
she
came
from
the
bathroom
she
found
a
blue
dinner
dress
neatly
pressed
and
laid
on
the
bed
two
weeks
of
this
life
and
i
wo
even
be
able
to
brush
my
own
teeth
she
thought
no
wonder
jack
is
such
a
spoiled
darling
penny
wondered
what
maud
weems
would
say
if
she
were
there
the
parkers
lived
nearly
a
hundred
miles
away
in
a
city
called
riverview
and
weems
the
housekeeper
had
looked
after
penny
since
the
death
of
her
mother
many
years
before
parker
known
throughout
the
state
published
a
daily
newspaper
the
and
his
daughter
frequently
helped
him
by
writing
news
or
offering
unrequested
advice
in
truth
neither
she
nor
her
father
had
been
eager
to
spend
a
vacation
with
members
of
the
gandiss
family
feeling
that
they
were
practically
strangers
jack
penny
feared
might
prove
a
particular
trial
in
the
living
room
a
cheerful
fire
had
been
started
in
the
grate
and
gandiss
were
chatting
with
parker
trying
their
best
to
make
him
feel
at
home
an
awkward
break
in
the
conversation
was
covered
by
announcement
that
dinner
was
served
jack
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
remained
conspicuously
empty
where
is
the
boy
gandiss
asked
his
wife
in
a
disapproving
tone
i
sure
i
do
know
she
sighed
the
last
i
saw
him
he
was
down
at
the
dock
a
servant
was
sent
to
find
jack
after
a
long
absence
he
returned
to
say
that
the
boy
was
nowhere
on
the
island
and
that
the
motorboat
was
missing
he
off
somewhere
again
and
without
permission
gandiss
said
irritably
probably
to
the
harpers
you
see
what
i
mean
parker
a
growing
boy
is
a
fearful
problem
penny
and
her
father
avoided
a
discussion
of
such
a
personal
subject
an
excellent
dinner
of
six
courses
was
served
in
perfect
style
but
while
the
food
was
well
cooked
no
one
really
enjoyed
the
meal
coffee
in
tiny
china
cups
was
offered
in
gandiss
study
his
wife
excused
herself
to
go
to
the
kitchen
for
a
moment
and
the
two
men
were
left
alone
with
penny
unexpectedly
gandiss
said
anthony
i
suppose
you
wonder
why
i
really
invited
you
here
i
am
curious
parker
admitted
lighting
a
cigar
does
your
son
jack
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
need
advice
in
dealing
with
the
boy
gandiss
acknowledged
it
occurred
to
me
that
association
with
a
sensible
girl
like
your
daughter
might
help
to
straighten
him
out
i
would
count
on
that
penny
interposed
hastily
as
dad
can
tell
you
i
have
a
lot
of
most
unsensible
ideas
of
my
own
jack
is
a
problem
gandiss
resumed
but
i
have
even
more
serious
ones
how
are
you
two
at
solving
a
mystery
parker
winked
at
his
daughter
and
paid
her
tribute
penny
has
built
up
quite
a
reputation
for
herself
as
an
amateur
sherlock
holmes
running
down
gangsters
is
her
specialty
dad
you
egg
penny
said
indignantly
both
men
laughed
but
gandiss
immediately
became
serious
again
my
problem
is
difficult
he
declared
and
i
believe
you
may
be
able
to
help
me
because
i
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
manner
in
which
you
have
solved
other
mysteries
only
in
the
interests
of
gaining
good
stories
for
our
newspaper
parker
supplied
this
probably
would
not
net
a
story
for
your
paper
the
island
owner
said
in
fact
we
are
particularly
anxious
to
keep
the
facts
from
getting
into
print
the
truth
is
strange
things
have
occurred
at
my
airplane
factory
in
osage
gandiss
did
not
finish
for
at
that
moment
someone
rapped
loudly
on
an
outside
screen
door
chapter
through
the
window
now
who
can
that
be
gandiss
remarked
startled
by
the
knock
on
the
door
i
heard
no
motorboat
approach
the
island
he
waited
and
a
moment
later
a
servant
entered
to
say
that
two
detectives
jason
fellows
and
stanley
williams
had
arrived
from
the
factory
and
wished
to
report
to
him
penny
and
her
father
politely
arose
to
withdraw
but
gandiss
waved
them
back
into
chairs
no
do
go
he
said
i
want
you
to
meet
these
men
the
two
detectives
who
had
reached
the
island
in
a
rented
motorboat
appeared
in
the
doorway
gandiss
introduced
them
to
penny
and
her
father
and
then
inquired
what
had
brought
them
to
the
house
at
so
late
an
hour
it
the
same
old
story
only
more
of
it
detective
williams
said
tersely
another
large
supply
of
brass
disappeared
from
the
factory
yesterday
any
clues
not
a
one
obviously
the
brass
is
being
stolen
by
employes
but
so
far
the
guilty
persons
have
eluded
all
our
traps
have
you
calculated
how
much
i
am
losing
a
year
gandiss
asked
bitterly
at
the
present
resale
value
of
brass
and
copper
not
less
than
a
year
fellows
reported
however
the
thieves
are
becoming
bolder
day
by
day
so
your
loss
may
run
much
higher
see
here
gandiss
said
showing
irritation
i
paying
you
fellows
a
salary
to
catch
those
thieves
and
i
expect
action
you
say
you
have
no
clues
several
employes
are
under
suspicion
williams
disclosed
but
we
have
enough
evidence
to
make
any
accusations
or
arrests
then
get
some
evidence
gandiss
snapped
this
ring
of
petty
thieves
must
be
broken
up
if
you
ca
produce
results
i
turn
the
case
over
to
another
agency
after
the
two
detectives
had
gone
the
island
owner
began
to
pace
the
floor
nervously
now
you
know
why
i
wanted
you
to
come
here
parker
he
said
slumping
down
into
a
chair
again
my
plant
which
is
making
war
materials
is
being
systematically
looted
of
valuable
copper
and
brass
the
pieces
smuggled
out
are
small
in
size
but
they
count
up
to
a
staggering
total
sabotage
parker
inquired
i
doubt
it
the
island
owner
replied
frowning
while
the
thefts
slow
up
our
war
work
the
delay
is
not
serious
materials
disappear
from
the
stock
rooms
and
from
the
floors
where
the
girls
work
i
hold
a
theory
that
the
metal
is
being
taken
by
employes
who
resell
it
for
personal
gain
it
looks
like
a
simple
case
of
theft
parker
declared
i
should
think
your
detectives
would
have
no
trouble
running
down
the
guilty
persons
that
what
i
thought
at
first
gandiss
answered
grimly
it
appeared
as
easy
as
a
b
but
all
ordinary
methods
of
catching
the
thieves
have
failed
obviously
the
thefts
are
well
organized
by
someone
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
plant
it
getting
on
my
nerves
have
you
called
in
the
police
no
and
i
do
intend
to
the
matter
must
be
handled
quietly
why
i
need
your
advice
but
i
no
detective
parker
protested
why
call
on
me
because
you
and
your
daughter
have
solved
some
pretty
tangled
cases
only
for
the
newspaper
parker
replied
how
many
employes
do
you
have
at
the
plant
about
and
not
a
scrap
of
real
evidence
against
any
individual
there
seems
to
be
a
perfect
system
in
accounting
for
all
the
stock
yet
somehow
it
gets
away
from
the
factory
have
you
had
employes
searched
as
they
leave
the
building
no
we
have
dared
resort
to
that
gandiss
answered
you
search
such
a
large
number
of
workers
if
we
tried
it
half
the
force
would
quit
i
be
glad
to
help
you
if
i
could
parker
offered
unfortunately
i
do
see
how
i
can
if
professional
detectives
have
failed
let
me
be
the
judge
of
that
said
the
island
owner
quickly
will
you
and
your
daughter
visit
the
factory
with
me
in
the
morning
we
welcome
the
opportunity
then
we
go
into
the
records
and
all
the
details
tomorrow
gandiss
declared
well
satisfied
i
know
you
be
able
to
help
me
penny
and
her
father
were
tired
and
shortly
after
ten
went
to
their
rooms
gandiss
problem
interested
them
though
they
felt
that
he
had
greatly
overrated
their
ability
in
believing
they
could
contribute
to
a
solution
of
the
mystery
i
not
certain
i
care
to
become
involved
parker
confessed
to
penny
who
in
robe
and
slippers
had
tiptoed
into
his
room
to
say
goodnight
but
dad
we
ca
decently
refuse
penny
returned
eagerly
i
think
it
would
be
fun
to
try
to
catch
those
thieves
well
we
see
yawned
parker
skip
back
to
bed
now
penny
read
a
magazine
for
an
hour
and
then
switched
off
the
light
on
the
night
table
snuggling
down
under
the
silk
coverlet
she
slept
soundly
sometime
later
she
found
herself
suddenly
awake
though
what
had
aroused
her
she
could
not
guess
the
room
remained
dark
but
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
slanted
through
the
venetian
blinds
penny
rolled
over
and
settled
down
for
another
snooze
then
she
heard
a
disturbing
sound
the
wooden
blinds
were
rattling
ever
so
slightly
yet
there
was
no
breeze
next
her
startled
gaze
focused
upon
a
hand
which
had
been
thrust
through
the
window
to
stealthily
push
the
blinds
aside
a
leg
appeared
over
the
sill
and
a
dark
figure
stepped
boldly
into
the
bedroom
terrified
penny
sat
up
so
quickly
that
the
bed
springs
creaked
a
loud
protest
instantly
the
intruder
turned
his
face
toward
her
keep
quiet
he
hissed
with
mingled
relief
and
indignation
penny
recognized
jack
he
tiptoed
to
the
bed
now
do
let
out
a
yip
he
cautioned
i
do
want
mom
or
my
father
to
hear
well
of
all
the
nerve
penny
exclaimed
indignantly
is
this
my
room
or
is
it
your
private
runway
do
go
off
the
deep
end
all
the
doors
are
locked
and
the
servants
have
orders
not
to
let
me
in
if
i
am
late
it
nearly
morning
said
penny
hiding
a
yawn
where
in
the
world
did
you
go
town
jack
answered
briefly
penny
began
to
understand
the
cause
of
gandiss
worry
about
his
son
now
do
give
me
that
than
thou
line
jack
said
anticipating
a
lecture
i
not
going
to
the
dogs
nearly
as
fast
as
the
old
man
believes
he
an
old
fossil
you
should
speak
of
your
father
that
way
penny
replied
after
all
has
he
given
you
everything
he
tries
to
keep
me
tied
to
his
apron
strings
jack
sat
down
on
the
bed
stretching
luxuriously
mom
is
quite
so
unreasonable
both
of
your
parents
seem
like
wonderful
people
to
me
maybe
i
know
better
than
you
do
jack
grinned
oh
they
okay
in
their
way
do
get
me
wrong
but
my
father
always
is
trying
to
shove
me
around
if
it
had
been
for
your
open
window
i
have
had
to
sleep
out
in
the
cold
and
it
would
have
served
you
right
too
you
went
off
without
saying
a
word
to
your
parents
and
worried
them
half
to
death
now
kindly
remove
your
carcass
from
this
bed
oh
cut
the
lecture
jack
pleaded
getting
up
and
yawning
again
gosh
i
hungry
let
find
something
to
eat
in
the
kitchen
let
not
retorted
penny
giving
him
a
shove
clear
out
of
here
or
i
heave
the
lamp
at
you
oh
all
right
kitten
he
said
soothingly
i
going
remember
your
promise
not
to
go
wagging
your
tongue
about
what
time
i
got
in
i
did
promise
a
thing
but
you
will
chuckled
jack
confidently
see
you
in
the
morning
he
tiptoed
from
the
room
and
penny
heard
him
stirring
about
in
the
kitchen
the
refrigerator
door
opened
and
closed
several
times
then
at
last
all
became
quiet
again
the
conceited
egg
she
thought
irritably
now
i
so
thoroughly
awakened
i
ca
possibly
go
back
to
sleep
tossing
about
for
a
few
minutes
she
finally
arose
and
dressed
deciding
to
take
an
early
morning
walk
about
the
island
she
moved
noiselessly
through
the
house
to
the
kitchen
there
she
paused
to
note
the
wreckage
jack
had
left
in
his
wake
the
refrigerator
door
was
wide
open
as
she
closed
it
she
saw
dishes
of
salad
chicken
pickles
and
tomatoes
in
a
depleted
state
jack
had
topped
off
his
feast
with
a
quart
of
milk
and
the
bottle
together
with
a
pile
of
chicken
bones
cluttered
the
sink
a
step
was
heard
in
the
dining
room
startled
penny
turned
quickly
around
but
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
the
gandiss
cook
stood
in
the
kitchen
doorway
eyeing
her
with
obvious
disapproval
chapter
unwanted
advice
just
having
an
early
morning
snack
bevens
the
cook
inquired
why
no
stammered
penny
that
is
confronted
with
the
empty
milk
bottle
a
chicken
skeleton
and
two
empty
food
dishes
it
seemed
futile
to
deny
such
incriminating
evidence
though
tempted
to
speak
of
jack
she
decided
it
would
not
be
sporting
of
her
young
people
have
such
healthy
appetites
the
cook
sighed
i
had
counted
on
that
chicken
for
luncheon
but
never
mind
i
can
send
to
the
mainland
for
something
else
feeling
like
a
criminal
penny
fled
to
her
room
i
could
tar
and
feather
jack
she
thought
furiously
if
he
ever
gets
up
i
make
him
explain
to
the
cook
the
breakfast
bell
rang
at
eight
when
penny
joined
the
group
downstairs
she
was
surprised
to
see
jack
in
a
fresh
suit
looking
little
the
worse
for
having
been
out
all
night
what
time
did
you
get
in
jack
his
father
inquired
pointedly
well
now
i
just
do
remember
the
boy
answered
winking
at
penny
did
you
get
in
might
be
a
better
question
if
i
recollect
correctly
all
of
the
doors
were
locked
last
night
at
midnight
penny
decidedly
uncomfortable
would
have
confessed
her
part
had
not
jack
sent
her
a
warning
glance
as
everyone
went
in
to
breakfast
the
matter
was
allowed
to
rest
ravenously
hungry
penny
ate
two
waffles
and
several
pieces
of
bacon
observing
the
butler
amazed
gaze
upon
her
she
guessed
that
the
cook
had
told
him
of
the
chicken
episode
breakfast
over
she
managed
to
get
jack
into
a
corner
listen
she
said
indignantly
why
do
you
tell
your
parents
exactly
what
happened
bevens
thinks
i
ate
up
all
the
chicken
does
she
jack
chuckled
that
rich
do
you
dare
give
me
away
you
give
me
a
pain
penny
retorted
losing
all
patience
if
i
a
guest
in
your
house
i
think
i
might
slug
you
go
ahead
jack
invited
unruffled
you
a
little
spitfire
just
like
sally
oh
by
the
way
how
about
a
trial
run
in
the
not
the
new
sailboat
jack
nodded
his
face
animated
she
was
delivered
yesterday
and
is
smooth
as
silk
the
mast
may
need
to
be
stepped
back
a
notch
or
so
but
otherwise
she
perfect
for
the
race
want
to
sail
with
me
i
love
to
penny
said
forgetting
her
resentment
hand
in
hand
they
ran
down
the
path
to
the
docks
built
to
gandiss
specifications
at
a
cost
of
nearly
two
thousand
dollars
was
a
magnificent
boat
sixteen
feet
from
bow
to
stern
its
new
coat
of
white
was
satin
smooth
and
its
metalwork
gleamed
in
the
morning
sun
she
fast
jack
declared
proudly
sally
barker
has
a
chance
to
win
that
race
will
she
have
a
new
boat
no
the
captain
ca
afford
it
she
have
to
sail
again
in
all
honesty
jack
added
it
a
good
boat
though
captain
barker
built
it
himself
together
they
put
up
the
snowy
white
mainsail
and
jack
shoved
off
from
the
dock
heading
upstream
the
boy
demonstrated
how
close
to
the
wind
the
would
sail
she
good
in
a
light
breeze
too
he
declared
no
matter
what
sort
of
weather
we
get
for
the
race
i
figure
i
win
there
an
old
saying
that
pride
goeth
before
a
fall
penny
reminded
him
also
one
about
not
counting
your
chickens
poultry
never
interested
me
jack
grinned
his
eyes
on
the
peak
of
the
mainsail
i
win
that
brass
lantern
trophy
from
sally
if
it
the
last
act
of
my
life
penny
who
had
sailed
a
boat
for
several
seasons
in
riverview
hoped
that
jack
would
offer
her
the
tiller
oblivious
to
her
hints
he
kept
the
heeling
along
so
fast
that
water
fairly
boiled
behind
the
rudder
jack
was
a
good
sailor
and
knew
it
observing
the
plying
her
usual
course
the
boy
deliberately
steered
to
cross
her
path
as
penny
well
knew
by
rules
of
navigation
the
ferryboat
was
compelled
to
watch
out
for
the
smaller
boat
with
apparent
unconcern
jack
forced
the
to
change
courses
as
the
boats
passed
fairly
close
to
each
other
sally
appeared
at
the
railing
a
bandana
handkerchief
covered
her
hair
and
she
wore
slacks
and
a
white
sweater
watching
the
with
concentration
she
cupped
her
hands
and
shouted
if
you
sail
near
hat
island
better
be
careful
jack
the
river
level
is
dropping
fast
this
morning
there
a
shoal
when
i
need
advice
from
you
i
ask
for
it
jack
replied
furiously
turning
his
back
to
the
ferry
sally
waved
derisively
and
disappeared
into
the
pilot
house
why
are
you
two
nicer
to
each
other
penny
demanded
suddenly
it
seems
to
me
you
deliberately
try
to
wave
a
red
flag
at
her
for
instance
sailing
across
the
bow
oh
i
just
intend
to
show
sally
she
ca
push
me
around
let
go
home
suddenly
tiring
of
the
sport
jack
let
out
the
mainsail
and
the
boat
glided
swiftly
before
the
wind
approaching
a
small
island
tangled
with
bushes
and
vines
penny
noted
that
the
water
was
growing
shallow
she
called
jack
attention
to
the
muddy
bottom
beneath
them
oh
it
deep
enough
through
here
the
boy
responded
carelessly
i
make
the
passage
every
day
what
island
are
we
passing
hat
the
water
always
is
shoal
here
just
sit
tight
and
quit
scowling
at
me
i
did
know
i
was
penny
said
sinking
back
into
the
cushions
the
gently
grazed
bottom
dismayed
penny
straightened
up
peering
over
the
side
the
boat
was
running
hard
into
a
mud
bank
about
bring
her
about
jack
she
cried
before
she
considered
how
he
might
take
the
uninvited
advice
the
water
is
deep
enough
here
jack
answered
stubbornly
it
only
a
tiny
shoal
we
sail
through
it
easily
penny
said
nothing
more
though
her
lips
drew
into
a
tight
line
jack
held
to
his
course
for
a
moment
it
appeared
that
the
boat
would
glide
over
the
shoal
into
deeper
water
then
the
next
instant
they
were
hard
aground
the
sail
began
to
flap
we
stuck
like
a
turtle
in
a
puddle
commented
penny
not
without
satisfaction
we
get
off
jack
cried
seizing
a
paddle
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
he
tried
to
shove
away
from
the
shoal
but
the
wind
against
the
big
sail
resisted
his
strength
you
never
get
off
that
way
penny
said
calmly
why
not
take
down
the
sail
we
hard
aground
now
jack
glared
and
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
heave
the
paddle
at
her
okay
he
growled
winds
which
came
from
the
head
of
hat
island
were
tricky
before
jack
could
lower
the
sail
the
breeze
shifting
slightly
struck
the
expanse
of
canvas
from
directly
aft
look
out
jack
penny
screamed
a
warning
we
going
to
jibe
jack
ducked
but
not
quickly
enough
with
great
violence
the
wind
swung
the
sail
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
boat
the
boom
striking
him
a
stunning
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
moaning
with
pain
he
slumped
into
the
bottom
of
the
chapter
sweeper
joe
informs
alarmed
for
jack
penny
scrambled
over
a
seat
to
his
side
he
had
been
struck
a
hard
blow
by
the
swinging
boom
and
there
was
a
tiny
jagged
cut
just
behind
his
ear
a
glance
satisfied
the
girl
that
he
was
not
seriously
injured
and
that
she
could
do
nothing
for
him
at
the
moment
turning
her
attention
to
the
sail
which
was
showing
an
inclination
to
slam
over
again
she
quickly
pulled
it
in
and
lowered
it
to
the
deck
by
then
jack
had
opened
his
eyes
his
bewildered
gaze
rested
upon
her
and
he
rubbed
his
head
you
he
mumbled
raising
on
an
elbow
penny
firmly
pushed
him
back
lie
still
she
commanded
seizing
the
paddle
she
tried
to
shove
the
boat
backwards
off
the
mud
bank
her
best
efforts
would
not
move
it
an
inch
slowly
jack
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
position
he
rubbed
his
head
bewilderment
changed
to
a
look
of
comprehension
i
okay
now
he
said
huskily
we
hard
aground
are
we
solid
as
a
rock
agreed
penny
wiping
perspiration
from
her
forehead
any
ideas
i
get
out
and
push
you
not
strong
enough
you
took
a
nasty
blow
on
the
head
had
not
jack
looked
so
thoroughly
miserable
penny
might
have
been
tempted
to
adopt
an
i
told
you
so
attitude
there
had
been
no
excuse
for
running
aground
sally
barker
had
warned
them
about
the
shoal
and
jack
deliberately
had
disregarded
her
advice
i
guess
it
was
my
fault
jack
mumbled
the
words
coming
with
difficulty
the
water
was
deep
enough
here
yesterday
i
was
so
sure
his
eyes
like
those
of
an
abused
puppy
appealed
to
her
for
sympathy
suddenly
penny
resentment
vanished
and
she
felt
sorry
for
jack
never
mind
she
said
kindly
we
get
off
somehow
if
necessary
i
can
swim
to
shadow
island
for
help
it
wo
be
necessary
jack
pulled
off
shoes
and
socks
and
rolled
up
his
slacks
above
his
knees
i
got
us
into
this
and
i
get
us
out
just
sit
tight
despite
penny
protests
he
swung
over
the
side
into
the
shallow
water
applying
his
shoulder
to
the
bow
he
pushed
with
all
his
strength
penny
dug
into
the
mud
with
the
paddle
the
boat
groaned
and
clung
fast
to
the
shoal
then
inch
by
inch
it
began
to
move
backwards
we
off
penny
cried
jubilantly
jack
pushed
until
the
was
safely
away
from
the
shoal
wet
and
plastered
with
mud
he
scrambled
aboard
no
use
putting
up
the
sail
he
said
gloomily
the
centerboard
is
damaged
when
we
went
aground
i
should
have
pulled
it
up
but
things
happened
so
fast
i
did
think
of
it
ca
it
be
repaired
oh
sure
but
it
means
hauling
the
boat
out
of
water
for
several
days
and
the
race
will
be
held
in
a
week
i
have
no
chance
to
practice
it
a
bad
break
penny
said
sympathetically
perhaps
the
centerboard
is
much
damaged
they
paddled
to
the
shadow
island
dock
there
with
the
help
of
the
gandiss
chauffeur
jack
tied
ropes
under
the
bottom
of
the
and
by
means
of
a
hoist
and
crane
lifted
the
boat
a
few
feet
out
of
water
a
piece
had
been
broken
from
the
centerboard
and
the
bottom
was
so
badly
scratched
that
it
would
have
to
be
repainted
before
the
race
i
call
this
wretched
luck
jack
fumed
it
will
take
days
to
repair
and
repaint
the
the
accident
had
a
subduing
effect
upon
the
boy
and
the
remainder
of
the
day
he
tried
to
make
amends
to
penny
they
swam
together
and
played
three
sets
of
tennis
in
each
contest
penny
won
with
ease
you
about
the
first
girl
who
ever
beat
me
at
anything
jack
said
ruefully
guess
that
rap
on
the
head
did
me
no
good
how
about
the
sailboat
race
penny
tripped
him
did
sally
win
the
lantern
trophy
grudgingly
jack
admitted
that
she
had
but
the
race
was
a
fluke
he
added
the
wind
was
tricky
and
favored
sally
old
tub
it
wo
happen
twice
annoyed
by
the
youth
alibis
penny
turned
and
walked
away
at
dinner
that
night
gandiss
suggested
that
parker
and
his
daughter
might
like
to
visit
his
steel
plant
and
airplane
factory
on
the
mainland
despite
vigorous
protests
jack
was
taken
along
the
buildings
owned
by
gandiss
were
situated
across
the
river
in
the
town
of
osage
occupying
many
city
blocks
the
property
included
an
airplane
testing
ground
and
was
protected
by
a
high
guard
fence
electrically
charged
every
employee
must
pass
inspection
at
the
gate
gandiss
explained
as
the
taxi
cab
approached
the
entrance
to
the
main
factory
we
operate
on
a
hour
basis
now
and
even
so
ca
keep
abreast
of
orders
lights
blazed
in
the
low
rows
of
windows
and
from
the
chimneys
of
the
steel
plant
fire
leaped
high
into
the
dark
sky
will
we
be
able
to
see
steel
poured
from
the
furnaces
penny
asked
eagerly
i
always
wanted
to
watch
it
done
you
may
tour
every
building
if
your
feet
hold
out
gandiss
chuckled
a
squat
man
with
pouchy
eyes
halted
the
taxi
cab
at
the
gate
no
visitors
allowed
here
at
night
he
began
in
a
surly
voice
and
then
recognized
the
plant
owner
his
manner
changed
instantly
oh
it
you
gandiss
how
are
you
this
evening
very
well
thank
you
clayton
i
have
some
friends
with
me
who
wish
to
see
the
plant
drive
right
in
the
gateman
invited
swinging
open
the
barrier
the
taxi
rolled
through
the
gate
and
drew
up
in
front
of
one
of
the
buildings
inside
fluorescent
lights
gave
the
effect
of
daylight
overhead
carriers
were
lifting
newly
blanked
and
formed
airplane
parts
from
power
presses
carrying
them
to
lines
raw
materials
brought
by
boats
enter
one
end
of
the
building
gandiss
explained
proudly
miraculously
they
come
out
the
other
end
as
finished
airplanes
ready
for
testing
the
plant
had
four
main
assembly
lines
along
which
the
wings
fuselages
engines
tail
surfaces
pilot
and
bombardier
floors
were
assembled
he
explained
in
one
room
the
party
paused
to
watch
row
upon
row
of
fuselages
being
put
together
ready
for
transfer
to
the
main
assembly
line
you
have
a
wonderful
factory
here
gandiss
penny
father
praised
much
impressed
it
must
be
a
job
to
keep
tab
on
the
personnel
oh
everything
has
been
reduced
to
a
system
one
department
meshes
into
another
but
if
production
falls
down
in
any
one
department
results
could
be
serious
gandiss
frowned
and
added
now
take
those
petty
brass
thefts
in
a
way
it
is
a
trivial
matter
but
the
practice
is
spreading
the
disappearance
of
parts
has
curtailed
production
to
any
extent
not
as
yet
but
it
has
caused
our
stockrooms
serious
annoyance
then
the
loss
on
a
yearly
basis
will
become
considerable
the
guilty
persons
must
be
caught
and
the
organizers
broken
up
before
it
gets
more
serious
gandiss
escorted
the
visitors
into
another
large
room
where
hundreds
of
girls
in
slacks
their
hair
bound
by
nets
worked
over
machines
with
concentrated
attention
our
beginners
start
here
he
explained
strangely
we
lose
more
brass
and
copper
from
this
shift
than
anywhere
else
in
the
plant
how
do
you
explain
it
penny
asked
the
girls
are
new
and
we
are
convinced
they
are
being
misled
by
someone
the
entire
situation
has
us
baffled
few
of
the
workers
paid
the
visitors
heed
as
they
wandered
along
the
rows
of
machines
however
a
slovenly
man
with
a
push
broom
watched
them
with
deep
interest
known
as
joe
the
sweeper
though
his
real
name
was
joseph
jakaboloski
he
once
had
been
a
skilled
mechanic
two
of
his
fingers
were
missing
and
he
no
longer
did
any
useful
work
see
that
man
gandiss
said
in
an
undertone
shortly
after
he
started
working
for
us
two
years
ago
he
had
an
accident
that
was
entirely
his
own
fault
we
immediately
put
him
in
an
easy
job
and
still
pay
him
his
former
salary
but
he
does
even
sweep
a
room
properly
why
not
let
him
go
parker
questioned
gandiss
smiled
and
shook
his
head
he
was
injured
while
working
for
us
so
we
are
responsible
for
looking
after
him
we
would
like
to
pension
him
off
you
see
he
constantly
stirs
up
trouble
among
the
new
employes
joe
the
sweeper
had
been
watching
gandiss
with
concentrated
attention
though
too
far
away
to
hear
what
was
said
with
amusing
haste
he
swept
his
way
closer
to
the
group
finally
he
smirked
and
sidled
up
to
the
factory
owner
can
i
see
you
alone
fer
a
minute
mr
gandiss
he
asked
his
voice
a
whine
i
am
very
busy
the
factory
owner
discouraged
him
what
is
it
you
want
joe
edged
even
closer
dropping
his
voice
so
that
it
was
barely
audible
above
the
clatter
of
the
machinery
you
been
losin
copper
and
brass
from
your
factory
ai
you
the
direct
approach
startled
gandiss
he
gazed
at
joe
keenly
then
nodded
well
maybe
i
kin
help
you
what
it
worth
gandiss
was
careful
not
to
show
his
dislike
for
the
man
if
you
are
able
to
provide
information
which
will
lead
to
the
apprehension
of
the
thieves
i
see
that
you
get
a
substantial
salary
increase
joe
blinked
and
grinned
last
night
i
seen
a
girl
in
this
room
stick
a
piece
of
brass
into
her
shirt
front
she
carried
it
off
with
her
who
was
the
girl
dunno
her
name
a
blond
piece
in
blue
slacks
i
afraid
your
information
is
of
no
value
gandiss
said
impatiently
unless
you
know
who
she
is
she
a
new
gal
that
only
been
workin
here
a
few
nights
joe
supplied
hastily
you
give
me
that
salary
raise
if
i
turn
her
in
if
your
information
proves
correct
joe
eyes
brightened
with
a
crafty
light
and
he
jerked
his
head
toward
the
left
you
ca
see
her
from
here
he
muttered
but
you
can
get
her
name
easy
enough
she
the
gal
that
operates
machine
no
chapter
shift
i
detest
a
stool
pigeon
said
gandiss
after
joe
the
sweeper
had
slouched
away
however
his
information
may
be
valuable
i
ca
afford
not
to
investigate
it
not
wishing
to
attract
comment
from
the
other
employes
the
factory
owner
made
no
attempt
to
see
the
girl
under
suspicion
instead
he
escorted
the
party
to
his
private
office
ringing
a
buzzer
he
asked
one
of
the
foremen
to
bring
the
operator
of
machine
to
him
presently
she
came
in
a
thin
wiry
girl
in
blue
slacks
and
sweater
her
hair
was
bound
beneath
a
dark
net
and
she
wore
goggles
as
she
faced
gandiss
she
removed
the
latter
everyone
stared
for
the
girl
was
sally
barker
you
sent
for
me
mr
gandiss
subdued
and
embarrassed
her
eyes
roved
from
one
person
to
another
why
sally
said
the
factory
owner
in
astonishment
i
had
no
idea
you
were
working
here
on
the
night
shift
when
were
you
employed
a
week
ago
perplexed
gandiss
stared
at
the
girl
factory
badge
there
could
be
no
mistake
plainly
it
bore
the
number
you
like
the
work
he
asked
after
an
awkward
silence
not
very
well
she
confessed
truthfully
however
i
can
use
the
pay
i
receive
during
the
daytime
i
believe
you
help
your
father
aboard
the
gandiss
resumed
trying
to
be
friendly
rather
a
strenuous
program
when
do
you
sleep
oh
i
get
enough
rest
sally
spoke
indifferently
though
her
eyes
were
red
and
she
looked
tired
pop
did
want
me
to
take
the
job
but
i
have
a
special
use
for
the
money
pretty
clothes
i
suppose
or
perhaps
a
new
sailboat
a
college
education
gandiss
nodded
approvingly
and
then
recalling
the
serious
charge
against
the
girl
became
formal
again
you
wonder
why
i
sent
for
you
i
know
my
work
has
been
very
good
i
tried
but
i
keep
ruining
materials
this
gave
gandiss
the
opening
he
sought
what
do
you
do
with
the
discarded
pieces
he
inquired
why
i
just
throw
them
aside
the
question
plainly
puzzled
sally
you
may
have
heard
that
we
are
having
a
little
trouble
here
at
the
factory
what
sort
of
trouble
mr
gandiss
small
but
valuable
pieces
of
copper
and
brass
seem
to
disappear
with
alarming
regularity
most
of
the
thefts
have
been
attributed
to
workers
on
the
night
shift
sally
blue
eyes
opened
wide
but
she
returned
gandiss
steady
gaze
her
chin
raised
i
heard
talk
about
it
among
the
girls
she
replied
briefly
that
all
i
know
you
have
no
idea
who
may
be
taking
the
materials
not
the
slightest
sir
an
awkward
silence
fell
gandiss
started
to
speak
again
then
changed
his
mind
was
there
anything
else
sally
asked
stiffly
nothing
then
may
i
return
to
my
work
why
yes
it
was
gandiss
turn
to
appear
awkward
and
ill
at
ease
we
hope
you
will
enjoy
your
work
here
sally
he
said
feeling
that
a
friendly
word
was
necessary
to
end
the
interview
if
you
should
learn
anything
that
will
lead
to
the
arrest
of
the
thieves
i
hope
you
will
give
us
the
information
sally
inclined
her
head
slightly
in
assent
with
dignity
she
walked
from
the
office
no
one
spoke
for
several
minutes
after
the
girl
had
gone
then
gandiss
drew
a
deep
sigh
i
had
no
idea
sally
was
working
here
he
said
frowning
father
you
should
have
accused
her
of
stealing
jack
burst
out
my
dear
boy
i
accused
her
of
nothing
well
sally
is
proud
she
took
it
that
way
you
do
really
believe
she
would
stoop
to
such
a
thing
i
confess
i
do
know
what
to
think
joe
the
sweeper
may
not
be
a
reliable
informer
if
he
saw
her
hide
brass
in
her
clothing
as
he
claims
why
did
he
report
her
last
night
jack
demanded
sally
is
no
thief
i
known
her
since
she
was
a
kid
i
get
mighty
sore
at
her
sometimes
she
so
cocky
but
she
never
did
a
dishonest
act
in
her
life
i
glad
to
hear
you
defend
her
jack
gandiss
said
quietly
certainly
no
action
will
be
taken
without
far
more
conclusive
evidence
now
suppose
you
and
penny
amuse
yourselves
for
a
few
minutes
parker
and
i
have
a
few
business
matters
to
discuss
thus
dismissed
penny
and
jack
wandered
outside
want
to
see
the
steel
plant
jack
asked
indifferently
they
should
be
pouring
about
this
time
at
penny
eager
assent
he
led
her
to
another
building
up
a
steep
flight
of
iron
stairs
to
an
inner
balcony
which
overlooked
the
huge
blast
furnaces
in
the
noisy
hot
room
conversation
was
practically
impossible
gazing
below
penny
saw
a
crew
of
men
in
front
of
one
of
the
furnaces
cleaning
the
tapping
hole
with
a
long
rod
in
a
moment
a
signal
was
given
and
the
molten
steel
was
poured
into
a
ladle
capable
of
holding
a
hundred
and
fifty
tons
an
overhead
crane
operated
by
a
skilled
worker
lifted
the
huge
container
to
the
pouring
platform
next
the
molten
mass
was
turned
into
rectangular
ingots
or
molds
the
steel
will
cool
for
about
an
hour
before
it
is
ready
to
be
taken
from
the
mold
jack
shouted
in
penny
ear
moving
on
they
saw
other
ingots
already
cooled
and
in
a
stripping
shed
observed
cranes
with
huge
tongs
engage
the
lugs
of
the
molds
and
lift
them
from
the
ingots
each
one
of
those
ingots
weighs
twenty
thousand
pounds
jack
said
surprising
penny
with
his
knowledge
after
stripping
they
are
placed
in
pit
furnaces
and
brought
to
rolling
temperature
to
see
fiery
ribbons
of
steel
rolled
from
cherry
red
ingots
was
to
penny
the
most
fascinating
process
of
all
she
could
have
watched
for
hours
but
jack
bored
by
the
familiar
sight
kept
urging
her
on
leaving
the
steel
plant
they
returned
to
the
main
factory
buildings
and
without
thinking
sauntered
toward
the
room
where
sally
worked
a
portable
lunch
cart
had
just
supplied
hot
soup
and
sandwiches
to
the
employes
sally
sat
eating
at
her
machine
seeing
jack
she
quickly
looked
away
now
she
really
sore
at
me
and
i
ca
blame
her
jack
commented
who
is
joe
the
sweeper
anyhow
i
warrant
though
somewhat
amused
by
the
boy
staunch
defense
of
sally
penny
was
inclined
to
agree
in
his
second
observation
although
she
knew
nothing
of
the
man
who
had
turned
informer
she
had
not
liked
the
sly
look
of
his
face
before
the
pair
could
approach
sally
the
brief
lunch
period
came
to
an
end
a
whistle
blew
sending
the
girls
back
to
their
machines
you
have
to
step
on
it
a
foreman
told
sally
you
behind
in
your
quota
her
reply
was
inaudible
but
as
she
adjusted
her
machine
and
started
it
up
she
began
to
work
with
nervous
haste
this
is
no
place
for
sally
jack
said
obviously
bothered
she
never
was
cut
out
for
factory
work
and
that
foreman
rogers
who
is
over
her
he
a
regular
slave
driver
i
thought
you
did
like
sally
penny
teased
i
want
to
see
her
get
a
square
deal
that
all
jack
replied
his
face
flushing
joe
the
sweeper
sidled
over
to
the
couple
what
the
verdict
he
asked
in
a
confidential
tone
jack
pretended
not
to
understand
is
the
gal
going
to
get
fired
i
sure
i
do
know
jack
answered
coldly
why
does
it
mean
so
much
to
you
why
it
do
the
sweeper
muttered
she
ai
no
skin
off
my
elbow
penny
and
jack
walked
on
through
the
workroom
aware
that
many
pairs
of
eyes
followed
them
sally
bending
over
a
grinding
machine
looked
up
she
was
grinding
pieces
of
metal
measuring
each
with
a
micrometer
there
was
a
streak
of
grease
across
her
cheek
and
she
looked
very
tired
suddenly
as
sally
threw
the
wheel
in
there
was
a
loud
clattering
noise
the
foreman
came
running
he
threw
the
wheel
back
what
did
i
do
sally
gasped
shaking
from
nervousness
you
forgot
to
pull
this
lever
the
foreman
said
curtly
ruined
a
piece
of
work
too
now
try
to
think
what
you
doing
and
get
down
to
business
penny
and
jack
moved
away
not
wishing
to
add
to
the
embarrassment
but
a
few
minutes
later
in
leaving
the
workroom
they
again
passed
close
to
sally
machine
this
time
she
did
not
see
them
until
they
were
almost
beside
her
how
is
it
going
sally
jack
asked
in
a
friendly
way
sally
raised
her
eyes
and
in
so
doing
forgot
her
work
as
she
automatically
placed
the
metal
in
line
with
the
wheel
she
held
her
fingers
there
without
thinking
another
instant
and
they
would
have
been
mangled
horrified
penny
saw
what
was
about
to
happen
sally
she
cried
acting
instinctively
she
reached
and
jerked
the
girl
hand
away
from
the
swift
turning
machinery
the
wheel
had
missed
sally
fingers
by
a
mere
fraction
of
an
inch
the
foreman
came
running
again
obviously
annoyed
shutting
off
the
machine
he
demanded
to
know
what
was
wrong
sally
leaned
her
head
weakly
on
the
table
trying
to
regain
composure
her
face
was
drained
of
color
and
she
trembled
as
from
a
chill
thanks
she
said
brokenly
to
penny
i
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
tonight
i
not
coordinated
right
go
take
a
walk
the
foreman
advised
not
unkindly
a
nice
long
walk
get
a
drink
or
something
you
be
okay
i
never
learn
sally
said
in
a
choked
voice
sure
you
will
everyone
has
to
go
through
a
beginner
stage
get
yourself
a
drink
then
you
feel
better
let
me
go
with
you
penny
said
taking
sally
by
the
arm
without
conversation
they
made
their
way
between
the
long
rows
of
machines
to
the
locker
room
there
sally
sank
down
on
a
bench
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
i
nervous
and
upset
tonight
she
excused
herself
i
ca
seem
to
get
the
hang
of
machine
work
why
not
give
it
up
do
you
really
need
the
money
so
badly
no
sally
admitted
truthfully
i
set
my
heart
on
a
college
education
but
pop
could
raise
the
money
somehow
it
just
that
he
had
financial
troubles
the
past
year
and
i
wanted
to
help
out
some
persons
are
cut
out
to
be
factory
workers
penny
resumed
do
you
realize
that
you
nearly
lost
several
of
your
fingers
tonight
yes
sally
agreed
her
freckled
face
becoming
deadly
sober
always
be
grateful
to
you
what
gandiss
said
in
his
office
upset
me
i
was
thinking
of
my
work
i
thought
that
might
be
it
well
forget
the
entire
matter
if
you
can
sally
nodded
and
getting
up
drank
at
the
fountain
i
have
to
go
back
to
work
now
she
said
with
an
effort
first
i
get
myself
a
clean
hanky
with
a
key
which
she
wore
on
a
string
about
her
neck
the
girl
opened
her
locker
on
the
floor
lay
a
leather
jacket
that
had
fallen
from
its
hook
as
sally
picked
it
up
a
heavy
object
slipped
from
one
of
the
pockets
thudding
against
the
tin
of
the
locker
floor
she
stooped
quickly
to
retrieve
it
and
then
embarrassed
tried
to
shield
the
article
from
view
but
she
could
not
hide
it
from
penny
who
stood
directly
behind
the
object
that
had
fallen
from
the
jacket
was
a
small
coupling
of
brass
chapter
in
the
why
where
did
that
come
from
sally
murmured
as
she
fingered
the
piece
of
metal
i
never
put
it
in
my
locker
confused
she
raised
bewildered
eyes
to
penny
just
then
the
locker
room
door
opened
and
a
forelady
came
in
miss
grimley
keen
gaze
fastened
upon
the
brass
coupling
in
sally
hand
awkwardly
the
girl
tried
to
hide
it
in
a
fold
of
her
slacks
what
do
you
have
the
forelady
asked
moving
like
a
hawk
toward
the
girls
why
nothing
sally
stammered
is
that
a
piece
of
brass
miss
grimley
demanded
where
did
you
get
it
i
found
it
in
my
locker
in
your
locker
i
do
know
how
it
got
there
sally
said
quickly
reading
suspicion
in
the
other
face
i
sure
i
never
put
it
there
miss
grimley
took
the
brass
from
her
inspecting
it
briefly
this
looks
very
much
like
one
of
the
parts
that
has
been
disappearing
from
the
stockroom
she
said
her
voice
icy
but
i
never
been
near
the
stockroom
sally
cried
in
the
few
days
that
i
been
employed
here
i
barely
left
my
machine
penny
tried
to
intercede
in
the
girl
behalf
i
sure
sally
knew
nothing
about
the
article
being
in
her
locker
she
assured
the
forelady
when
she
opened
it
a
moment
ago
and
lifted
her
jacket
the
piece
of
brass
fell
from
a
pocket
someone
must
have
put
it
there
sally
added
indignantly
i
certain
i
never
did
have
you
given
your
locker
key
to
anyone
no
and
have
you
always
kept
it
locked
why
i
think
so
i
am
sorry
said
miss
grimley
in
a
tone
which
implied
exactly
the
opposite
but
i
will
have
to
report
this
you
understand
my
position
please
i
have
no
choice
miss
grimley
cut
her
short
come
with
me
please
penny
started
to
accompany
sally
but
the
forelady
by
a
gesture
indicated
that
she
was
not
to
come
the
door
closed
behind
them
for
ten
minutes
penny
waited
hoping
that
sally
would
return
finally
she
wandered
outside
sally
was
not
on
the
floor
and
another
girl
had
taken
her
place
at
the
machine
seeing
joe
the
sweeper
cleaning
a
corridor
penny
asked
him
about
sally
no
the
man
inquired
with
a
grin
which
showed
a
gap
between
his
front
upper
teeth
you
wo
see
her
no
more
she
in
the
employment
office
now
and
they
giving
her
the
can
you
mean
she
being
discharged
sure
we
do
want
no
thieves
around
here
sally
barker
is
a
thief
penny
retorted
loyally
by
the
way
how
did
you
know
why
the
girl
was
taken
to
the
office
the
question
momentarily
confused
joe
but
his
reply
was
glib
enough
oh
i
have
a
way
o
knowin
what
goes
on
around
here
he
smirked
i
figured
that
gal
was
the
day
they
hired
her
it
surprise
me
none
that
they
found
the
stuff
in
her
locker
and
who
told
you
that
penny
pursued
the
subject
why
you
said
so
yourself
oh
no
i
did
it
was
the
forelady
joe
corrected
himself
i
seen
the
brass
in
her
hand
when
she
came
out
of
the
locker
room
with
that
gal
disgusted
penny
turned
her
back
and
walked
away
in
search
of
jack
it
was
none
of
her
affair
she
knew
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
joe
the
sweeper
had
taken
more
than
ordinary
interest
in
sally
downfall
his
statements
too
had
been
confused
i
do
trust
that
fellow
she
thought
he
sly
and
mean
penny
could
not
find
jack
and
when
she
returned
to
gandiss
office
a
secretary
told
her
that
the
factory
owner
and
her
father
expected
to
meet
her
at
the
main
gate
hastening
there
penny
saw
no
sign
of
them
nor
was
the
gateman
on
duty
however
hearing
low
voices
inside
the
gatehouse
she
stepped
to
the
doorway
no
one
was
in
view
but
two
men
were
talking
in
the
inner
office
it
worked
slick
as
a
whistle
she
heard
one
of
them
say
the
girl
was
caught
with
the
stuff
on
her
and
they
fired
her
who
was
she
a
new
employee
named
sally
barker
good
enough
joe
that
ought
to
take
the
heat
off
the
others
for
awhile
at
least
the
name
startled
penny
who
instantly
wondered
if
one
of
the
speakers
might
be
sweeper
joe
confirming
her
suspicion
the
man
came
out
of
the
inner
room
a
moment
later
seeing
her
he
stopped
short
and
his
jaw
dropped
what
you
doin
here
he
demanded
gruffly
waiting
for
gandiss
penny
replied
and
you
joe
did
not
answer
mumbling
something
he
pushed
past
her
and
went
off
toward
the
main
factory
building
he
certainly
acting
as
if
he
deliberately
planned
to
get
sally
into
trouble
she
thought
resentfully
clayton
the
gateman
showed
his
face
a
moment
later
and
he
too
acted
as
he
checked
a
car
through
into
the
factory
grounds
he
glanced
sideways
at
penny
obviously
uneasy
as
to
how
much
she
might
have
overheard
been
here
long
he
inquired
carelessly
no
i
just
came
penny
answered
with
pretended
unconcern
i
waiting
for
my
father
the
men
did
not
come
immediately
however
as
penny
loitered
near
the
gatehouse
she
saw
sally
barker
hurriedly
leaving
the
factory
building
ai
you
off
early
tonight
the
gateman
asked
as
she
approached
i
off
for
good
sally
answered
shortly
her
face
was
and
she
did
not
try
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
had
been
crying
fired
that
right
sally
replied
unjustly
too
shoo
you
do
say
the
gateman
exclaimed
sympathetically
what
did
they
give
you
the
can
for
sally
in
no
mood
to
provide
details
went
on
without
answering
penny
ran
to
overtake
her
i
walk
with
you
to
the
boundaries
of
the
grounds
she
said
quickly
tell
me
what
happened
just
what
you
would
expect
sally
shrugged
they
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
in
the
personnel
office
i
told
the
truth
that
i
knew
nothing
about
that
putrid
piece
of
brass
that
turned
up
in
my
locker
then
they
gave
me
a
nice
little
lecture
and
said
they
were
sorry
but
my
services
no
longer
were
required
branded
as
a
thief
do
take
it
so
hard
sally
penny
said
kindly
someone
probably
planted
the
brass
in
your
locker
of
course
but
i
ca
prove
it
why
not
appeal
to
gandiss
he
likes
you
and
no
sally
said
firmly
kicking
at
a
piece
of
gravel
on
the
driveway
i
ask
no
favors
of
gandiss
he
would
have
me
reinstated
no
doubt
but
it
would
be
too
humiliating
do
you
know
of
anyone
in
the
factory
who
dislikes
you
sally
shook
her
head
that
the
funny
part
of
it
i
not
acquainted
with
anyone
i
just
started
in
how
about
joe
the
sweeper
oh
him
sally
was
scornful
he
caught
me
in
the
hall
the
other
day
and
tried
to
get
fresh
i
slapped
his
face
then
perhaps
he
was
the
one
that
got
you
into
trouble
he
too
stupid
sally
dismissed
the
subject
i
not
so
sure
of
that
returned
penny
thoughtfully
the
girls
had
reached
the
street
and
sally
bus
was
in
sight
what
will
you
do
now
penny
asked
hurriedly
get
a
job
at
another
factory
i
doubt
it
sally
replied
fishing
in
her
pocketbook
for
a
bus
token
i
help
pop
on
the
if
i
do
take
another
job
it
wo
be
until
after
the
sailboat
races
i
forgotten
about
that
when
is
the
race
the
preliminary
is
in
a
few
days
next
friday
the
finals
are
a
week
later
i
hope
you
win
said
penny
sincerely
i
certainly
be
on
hand
to
watch
the
bus
pulled
up
at
the
curb
employes
arriving
at
the
factory
for
work
crowded
past
the
two
girls
impulsively
sally
turned
and
squeezed
penny
hand
i
like
you
she
said
with
deep
feeling
you
been
kind
will
you
come
to
see
me
sometime
while
you
here
of
course
i
not
brought
back
those
clothes
i
borrowed
yet
i
look
for
you
sally
declared
warmly
i
feel
that
you
a
real
friend
squeezing
penny
hand
again
she
sprang
aboard
the
bus
and
was
lost
in
the
throng
of
passengers
chapter
several
days
of
inactivity
followed
for
penny
at
shadow
island
for
the
most
part
jack
was
friendly
and
tried
to
provide
entertainment
however
he
was
away
much
of
the
time
supervising
the
work
of
repairing
and
getting
the
into
condition
for
the
coming
trophy
race
sally
barker
name
seldom
was
mentioned
in
the
gandiss
household
though
it
was
known
that
the
girl
intended
to
enter
the
competition
regardless
of
her
disgrace
at
the
factory
once
penny
asked
jack
what
he
thought
of
the
entire
matter
just
what
i
always
did
he
answered
briefly
sally
never
took
anything
from
the
factory
it
would
be
in
keeping
with
her
character
then
why
is
she
cleared
father
did
take
the
matter
up
with
the
personnel
department
but
he
does
want
to
go
over
the
manager
head
the
brass
was
found
in
her
locker
and
quite
a
few
employes
learned
about
it
the
brass
was
planted
probably
agreed
jack
but
it
none
of
my
affair
sally
was
a
very
good
factory
worker
and
the
personnel
director
thought
he
had
to
make
an
example
of
someone
so
sally
became
the
goat
i
call
it
unfair
did
the
thefts
cease
after
she
left
they
worse
than
ever
then
obviously
sally
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
not
just
one
person
is
involved
the
brass
is
being
taken
by
an
organized
ring
of
employes
i
suppose
it
none
of
my
affair
but
in
justice
i
think
sally
should
be
cleared
i
do
know
the
girl
well
but
i
like
her
you
may
as
well
hear
the
whole
story
jack
said
uncomfortably
father
wrote
her
a
letter
inviting
her
to
come
in
for
an
interview
she
paid
no
attention
perhaps
she
did
get
the
letter
she
got
it
all
right
i
met
her
on
the
street
yesterday
and
when
i
tried
to
talk
to
her
she
threatened
to
heave
a
can
of
varnish
in
my
face
furthermore
she
gave
me
to
understand
she
intends
to
defeat
me
soundly
in
the
race
tomorrow
i
be
there
to
watch
grinned
penny
the
contest
should
be
interesting
while
jack
was
out
on
the
river
practicing
for
the
approaching
competition
penny
accompanied
her
father
to
the
mainland
to
mail
letters
and
make
a
few
purchases
gandiss
had
requested
in
returning
to
the
waterfront
they
wandered
down
a
street
within
view
of
the
gandiss
factory
penny
attention
was
drawn
to
a
man
who
came
out
of
an
alley
at
the
rear
of
the
plant
and
stood
staring
at
a
tiny
junk
shop
which
was
situated
directly
opposite
the
gandiss
factory
there
joe
the
sweeper
she
observed
aloud
and
then
an
instant
later
added
that
queer
what
is
inquired
her
father
why
that
junk
shop
i
been
down
this
street
several
times
but
i
never
noticed
it
there
before
i
would
have
sworn
that
the
building
was
empty
parker
gave
her
a
quick
amused
look
it
was
until
yesterday
he
informed
you
seem
to
know
all
about
it
penny
suddenly
became
suspicious
what
are
you
keeping
from
me
parker
did
not
reply
for
he
was
watching
the
man
who
had
emerged
from
the
alley
joe
seemed
to
debate
for
awhile
then
crossed
the
street
and
entered
the
junk
shop
good
exclaimed
parker
our
bait
seems
to
be
working
what
are
you
talking
about
penny
demanded
in
exasperation
will
you
kindly
explain
you
recall
gandiss
asked
me
to
help
him
solve
the
mystery
of
those
brass
thefts
at
the
plant
why
yes
but
i
did
know
you
had
begun
to
do
anything
about
it
our
plan
may
not
succeed
however
we
trying
out
a
little
idea
of
mine
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
that
junk
shop
yes
the
place
was
opened
yesterday
by
heiney
growski
penny
blue
eyes
opened
wide
for
she
knew
the
man
well
a
prominent
detective
in
riverview
he
had
won
distinction
by
solving
a
number
of
difficult
cases
heiney
is
an
expert
at
and
impersonation
parker
added
we
brought
him
here
and
installed
him
as
the
owner
of
the
junk
store
across
the
street
his
instructions
are
to
buy
brass
and
copper
at
above
the
prevailing
market
prices
you
expect
employes
who
may
be
pilfering
metals
to
seek
the
highest
price
obtainable
that
our
idea
it
may
not
work
it
should
penny
cried
jubilantly
sweeper
joe
went
in
there
not
three
minutes
ago
i
suspected
him
from
the
first
are
you
jumping
to
pretty
fast
conclusions
from
what
i
heard
him
say
to
the
gatekeeper
clayton
i
sure
he
mixed
up
in
some
underhanded
scheme
you
not
certain
of
it
penny
joe
has
been
carefully
investigated
he
seems
too
stupid
a
fellow
to
have
engineered
such
a
clever
organized
method
of
pilfering
he
never
appeared
stupid
to
me
dad
let
drift
over
to
the
junk
shop
and
learn
what
is
happening
and
give
everything
away
no
heiney
will
report
if
anything
of
consequence
develops
in
the
meantime
we
must
show
no
interest
in
the
shop
to
penny
disappointment
her
father
refused
to
remain
longer
in
the
vicinity
of
the
factory
without
glancing
toward
the
junk
shop
they
walked
on
to
the
riverfront
the
motorboat
they
had
expected
to
meet
them
had
not
yet
arrived
while
parker
purchased
a
newspaper
and
sat
down
on
the
dock
to
read
penny
sauntered
along
the
shore
a
short
distance
away
on
a
stretch
of
beach
a
boat
had
been
overturned
sally
barker
in
blue
overalls
rolled
to
the
knees
was
painting
it
with
deft
sure
strokes
penny
walked
over
to
watch
the
work
glancing
up
sally
smiled
but
did
not
speak
a
smudge
of
blue
paint
stained
her
cheek
she
had
sanded
the
bottom
of
the
and
now
was
slapping
on
a
final
coat
of
paint
will
it
dry
in
time
for
the
race
tomorrow
penny
inquired
making
conversation
the
finish
wo
be
hard
but
that
the
way
i
want
it
sally
said
dipping
her
brush
it
makes
a
faster
racing
bottom
then
you
all
ready
for
competition
the
boat
is
ready
sally
hesitated
then
added
but
i
may
not
enter
the
race
after
all
not
enter
why
having
finished
painting
sally
carefully
cleaned
her
brush
and
tightly
closed
the
paint
and
varnish
cans
she
wiped
her
hands
on
her
faded
overalls
the
boy
who
was
racing
with
me
served
notice
this
morning
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
i
have
asked
anyone
else
because
i
did
want
to
be
turned
down
but
i
should
think
anyone
who
likes
to
sail
would
be
crazy
for
the
chance
penny
began
then
as
she
met
sally
gaze
her
voice
trailed
off
you
know
what
i
mean
said
sally
quietly
not
the
factory
episode
yes
word
traveled
around
jack
did
tell
i
do
think
so
but
i
do
know
sally
replied
honestly
anyway
everyone
learned
why
i
was
discharged
pop
is
furious
your
mother
too
i
suppose
i
have
no
mother
she
died
when
i
was
ten
since
then
pop
and
i
have
lived
aboard
the
pop
always
taught
me
to
speak
my
mind
never
to
be
afraid
and
above
all
to
be
honest
to
be
accused
of
something
one
did
do
and
to
be
branded
as
a
thief
is
the
limit
penny
nodded
sympathetically
about
the
race
she
said
reverting
to
the
previous
subject
you
are
really
serious
about
not
entering
it
means
everything
to
me
sally
admitted
soberly
but
i
ca
race
alone
the
rules
call
for
two
persons
in
each
boat
you
need
an
expert
sailor
not
necessarily
of
course
the
person
would
have
to
know
how
to
handle
ropes
and
carry
out
orders
also
not
lose
his
head
in
an
emergency
to
balance
the
right
i
need
someone
about
my
own
weight
it
has
to
be
a
boy
mercy
no
i
would
prefer
a
girl
if
i
knew
whom
to
ask
sally
suddenly
caught
the
drift
of
penny
conversation
and
a
look
of
amazed
delight
came
upon
her
face
not
you
she
exclaimed
you
do
mean
you
would
be
willing
if
you
want
or
could
use
me
i
a
long
way
from
an
expert
but
i
do
know
a
little
about
sailboats
we
have
one
in
riverview
however
i
never
competed
in
a
race
i
be
tickled
pink
to
have
you
then
it
settled
but
what
about
the
gandiss
family
you
are
their
guest
that
part
is
a
bit
awkward
penny
admitted
but
they
are
all
good
sports
i
sure
no
one
will
hold
it
against
me
after
i
was
discharged
from
the
factory
that
really
was
gandiss
doing
sally
the
plant
is
so
large
he
scarcely
knows
what
goes
on
in
some
departments
you
were
discharged
by
the
personnel
manager
i
realize
that
did
gandiss
write
you
a
letter
asking
you
to
come
in
for
a
personal
interview
yes
he
did
sally
acknowledged
reluctantly
i
was
angry
and
i
tore
it
up
then
you
should
blame
mr
gandiss
i
not
blaming
him
penny
i
like
gandiss
very
much
in
fact
i
like
him
so
well
i
never
could
bear
to
accept
favors
from
him
not
even
to
clear
your
name
sally
washed
her
hands
at
the
river
edge
and
rolled
down
the
legs
of
her
overalls
the
person
who
put
that
brass
in
my
locker
has
been
caught
she
inquired
softly
not
to
my
knowledge
then
all
gandiss
could
do
would
be
to
offer
me
another
chance
sally
said
bitterly
i
never
work
in
the
factory
on
that
basis
if
i
am
cleared
completely
then
i
am
willing
to
go
back
gandiss
is
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
of
those
thefts
penny
declared
i
know
that
to
be
a
fact
have
you
any
idea
who
the
guilty
parties
might
be
sally
straightened
up
digging
at
paint
which
had
lodged
beneath
her
fingernails
she
did
not
answer
you
do
have
a
clue
penny
cried
maybe
sally
smiled
mysteriously
tell
me
what
it
is
no
i
intend
to
work
by
myself
until
i
sure
that
i
on
the
right
track
i
not
even
told
pop
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
sweeper
joe
sally
expression
became
blank
i
do
know
much
about
him
she
dismissed
the
subject
my
information
concerns
a
certain
house
upriver
but
do
ask
me
to
tell
you
more
hastily
she
gathered
up
paint
cans
and
brush
turning
to
leave
are
you
really
serious
about
racing
with
me
tomorrow
she
demanded
of
course
then
you
elected
first
mate
of
the
meet
me
at
the
yacht
club
dock
at
six
in
the
morning
for
a
trial
workout
the
preliminary
race
is
at
two
i
be
there
without
fail
and
bring
a
little
luck
with
you
sally
added
with
a
grin
we
may
need
it
to
defeat
the
chapter
when
penny
reached
the
dock
next
morning
she
found
that
sally
had
preceded
her
by
many
hours
the
varnished
wood
of
the
shone
in
the
sunlight
below
the
waterline
the
boat
was
as
smooth
and
slippery
as
glass
is
she
beautiful
sally
asked
proudly
squeezing
water
from
a
sponge
she
had
been
using
the
rigging
has
been
overhauled
and
pop
came
through
at
the
last
minute
with
a
new
jib
sail
every
rope
has
been
changed
too
it
looks
grand
penny
praised
you
must
have
worked
like
a
galley
slave
getting
everything
ready
for
the
race
i
have
but
i
want
to
win
this
race
means
everything
to
me
are
you
sure
you
want
me
to
sail
with
you
penny
asked
dubiously
after
all
i
am
not
an
expert
i
might
handicap
you
nonsense
there
no
one
i
would
rather
have
that
is
if
you
still
want
to
do
it
was
jack
angry
when
you
told
him
penny
confessed
that
she
had
not
spoken
to
any
of
the
gandiss
family
of
her
intention
to
take
part
in
the
race
but
it
will
be
all
right
she
added
jack
really
is
such
a
bad
sport
when
you
get
to
know
him
i
only
hope
we
win
oh
we
come
in
among
the
leading
five
that
certain
sally
said
carelessly
this
is
only
a
preliminary
race
today
the
five
winning
boats
will
compete
next
week
in
the
finals
if
you
lose
today
must
you
give
up
the
trophy
not
until
after
the
final
race
sally
laughed
goodnaturedly
but
put
such
ideas
in
my
head
we
ca
lose
i
grimly
determined
that
jack
must
beat
me
i
do
believe
the
race
is
a
personal
feud
between
you
two
why
does
it
mean
so
much
to
defeat
him
sally
stepped
nimbly
aboard
the
scrubbed
deck
stowing
away
the
sponge
under
one
of
the
seats
jack
and
i
always
have
been
rivals
she
admitted
we
went
to
grade
school
together
he
used
to
make
fun
of
me
because
i
lived
on
a
ferryboat
jack
was
only
a
kid
then
i
know
but
we
always
were
in
each
other
hair
we
competed
in
everything
debates
literary
competitions
sports
jack
usually
defeated
me
too
in
sailing
due
to
pop
coaching
i
may
have
a
slight
edge
over
him
do
you
really
dislike
jack
why
no
sally
tone
indicated
she
never
had
given
the
matter
previous
thought
if
he
were
around
to
fight
with
i
suppose
i
miss
him
terribly
penny
sat
down
on
the
dock
to
lace
up
a
pair
of
tennis
shoes
by
the
time
she
had
them
on
sally
was
ready
to
shove
off
for
the
trial
run
suppose
we
take
about
an
hour
and
then
rest
until
time
for
the
race
she
suggested
you
quickly
learn
the
tricks
of
this
little
boat
she
a
sweet
sailer
the
had
been
tied
to
the
dock
with
a
stiff
wind
blowing
across
it
and
larger
boats
were
berthed
on
either
side
to
get
away
smoothly
without
endangering
the
other
craft
would
be
no
easy
task
as
the
girls
ran
up
the
mainsail
a
few
loiterers
gathered
to
watch
the
departure
all
set
mate
grinned
sally
let
go
with
a
speed
that
amazed
penny
she
trimmed
the
main
and
jib
sheets
flat
amidships
placing
the
tiller
a
little
to
starboard
haul
up
the
centerboard
she
instructed
penny
pulled
up
the
board
feeling
a
trifle
awkward
and
inadept
sally
leaped
out
onto
the
dock
and
casting
off
held
the
boat
head
steady
into
the
eye
of
the
wind
with
a
tremendous
shove
which
delighted
the
spectators
she
sent
the
straight
aft
and
made
a
flying
leap
aboard
with
sails
flat
amidships
the
boat
shot
straight
backwards
as
they
started
to
clear
the
stern
of
the
boat
that
was
to
starboard
sally
let
the
tiller
move
over
to
that
side
the
bow
of
the
began
to
swing
to
starboard
not
until
then
did
penny
observe
that
the
was
tied
up
only
a
few
away
jack
armed
with
several
bottles
of
pop
came
hurriedly
from
the
clubhouse
noting
sally
spectacular
departure
he
joined
the
throng
at
the
railing
we
give
the
crowd
a
real
thrill
sally
muttered
keeping
her
voice
low
so
that
it
would
not
carry
over
the
water
if
this
trick
works
it
should
be
good
even
penny
was
worried
the
bow
of
the
had
swung
rapidly
to
starboard
but
sally
calm
and
cool
still
hung
on
to
the
sheets
put
your
tiller
the
other
way
jack
shouted
from
the
dock
let
your
sheet
run
enjoying
the
boy
excitement
sally
pretended
to
be
deaf
wind
had
struck
the
sails
but
the
continued
to
sail
backwards
a
crash
seemed
impossible
to
avert
then
at
the
last
instant
the
bow
swung
clear
of
the
neighboring
boats
grinning
triumphantly
sally
put
the
tiller
to
port
and
started
the
sheets
they
sailed
briskly
away
beautifully
done
praised
penny
not
one
sailor
in
a
hundred
could
pull
that
off
it
took
nerve
pop
taught
me
that
trick
it
risky
of
course
if
the
sails
should
decide
to
take
charge
or
the
tiller
should
fail
to
go
to
starboard
one
probably
would
collide
with
the
other
boats
you
surprised
jack
he
expected
you
to
crash
we
surprise
him
this
afternoon
too
sally
declared
confidently
steering
out
into
if
this
breeze
holds
it
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
for
an
hour
the
girls
practiced
maneuvers
until
penny
was
thoroughly
adept
at
handling
the
ropes
and
carrying
out
orders
although
the
rules
of
the
race
did
not
allow
them
to
sail
the
actual
course
sally
pointed
it
out
we
start
near
the
clubhouse
she
explained
then
taking
a
triangular
route
we
sail
past
hat
island
to
the
first
marker
after
rounding
it
we
keep
on
to
the
marker
near
the
eastern
river
shore
and
sail
back
to
our
starting
point
sally
was
in
high
spirits
for
she
declared
that
if
the
breeze
held
would
perform
at
her
best
though
no
one
knew
exactly
what
jack
new
boat
could
do
observation
had
convinced
most
sailing
enthusiasts
that
it
would
be
favored
in
a
light
breeze
i
hope
it
blows
a
gale
this
afternoon
sally
chuckled
as
they
moored
at
the
dock
get
some
rest
now
penny
and
meet
me
at
the
clubhouse
about
one
the
race
starts
sharp
at
two
penny
did
not
see
jack
when
she
returned
to
shadow
island
so
had
no
chance
to
tell
him
of
her
plan
to
sail
with
sally
in
the
competition
her
father
whom
she
took
into
her
confidence
was
not
entirely
in
favor
of
the
decision
we
are
guests
of
and
gandiss
he
reproved
mildly
to
sail
against
jack
is
a
tactless
thing
to
do
though
actually
you
may
do
him
a
favor
for
you
likely
be
more
of
a
handicap
than
a
help
in
the
race
that
what
i
figured
laughed
penny
by
chance
gandiss
overheard
the
conversation
entering
the
living
room
he
declared
that
penny
must
not
hesitate
to
enter
the
competition
after
all
the
race
is
supposed
to
be
for
fun
he
said
emphatically
lately
jack
and
sally
have
made
it
into
a
feud
i
really
think
it
would
do
the
boy
good
to
be
defeated
soundly
long
before
the
hour
of
the
race
penny
was
at
the
yacht
club
docks
dressed
in
blue
slacks
white
polo
shirt
and
an
added
jacket
for
protection
from
wind
and
blistering
sun
rays
rowboats
canoes
and
small
sailing
craft
plied
lazily
up
and
down
the
river
while
motor
yachts
with
flags
flying
cruised
past
the
clubhouse
out
in
the
main
channel
where
the
race
was
to
be
held
the
judges
boat
had
been
anchored
the
shores
were
thronged
with
spectators
many
of
whom
had
enjoyed
picnic
lunches
on
the
grassy
banks
penny
walked
along
the
dock
searching
for
the
she
came
first
to
the
which
was
just
preparing
to
get
underway
jack
and
a
youth
penny
did
not
know
were
busy
coiling
ropes
hi
penny
jack
greeted
her
glancing
up
from
his
work
you
going
to
see
a
real
race
today
will
i
take
sally
barker
for
a
breeze
just
at
that
moment
sally
herself
appeared
from
inside
the
clubhouse
seeing
penny
she
waved
and
called
come
on
mate
it
time
we
shove
off
jack
jaw
dropped
and
he
gazed
at
the
two
girls
accusingly
what
is
this
he
demanded
penny
you
not
racing
in
sally
boat
yes
i
am
well
if
that
is
something
jack
said
no
more
but
his
tone
had
made
it
clear
he
considered
penny
nothing
short
of
a
traitor
the
two
boats
presently
sailed
out
from
the
protecting
shores
to
join
the
other
which
had
entered
the
race
with
the
breeze
blowing
strong
the
contestants
tacked
rapidly
back
and
forth
jockeying
for
the
best
positions
at
the
start
of
the
contest
tensely
sally
glanced
at
her
wristwatch
five
minutes
until
two
she
observed
the
gun
will
go
off
any
minute
now
nineteen
boats
comprised
the
racing
fleet
but
in
comparison
to
jack
and
sally
many
of
the
youthful
captains
were
mere
novices
experts
were
divided
in
opinion
as
to
the
winner
but
nearly
everyone
agreed
it
would
be
either
jack
or
sally
with
the
odds
slightly
in
favor
of
the
latter
there
goes
the
signal
cried
sally
the
boats
made
a
bunched
start
with
and
in
the
best
positions
in
the
sharp
breeze
one
of
the
craft
carried
away
a
stay
and
with
a
broken
mast
dropped
out
of
the
race
the
others
headed
for
the
first
marker
at
first
sally
and
jack
raced
almost
bow
to
bow
then
gradually
the
forged
steadily
ahead
except
for
three
or
four
boats
the
others
began
to
fall
farther
and
farther
behind
we
win
penny
cried
jubilantly
it
too
soon
to
crow
yet
sally
warned
while
it
looks
as
if
this
breeze
will
hold
for
the
entire
race
no
one
can
tell
anything
might
happen
penny
glanced
back
at
jack
boat
a
good
six
to
eight
lengths
behind
the
boy
deliberately
turned
his
head
acting
as
if
he
did
not
see
her
the
hugged
the
marker
as
it
made
the
turn
at
hat
island
rounding
the
body
of
land
the
girls
were
annoyed
to
see
a
canoe
with
three
children
paddling
directly
across
their
course
now
how
did
they
get
out
here
sally
murmured
with
a
worried
frown
they
should
know
better
at
first
the
children
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
they
were
directly
in
the
path
of
the
racing
boats
but
as
they
saw
the
fleet
rounding
hat
island
in
the
wake
of
the
and
the
they
suddenly
became
with
frantic
haste
they
tried
to
get
out
of
the
way
in
her
confusion
one
of
the
girls
dropped
a
paddle
and
as
it
floated
away
she
made
a
desperate
lunge
to
recover
it
another
of
the
occupants
and
awkward
leaned
far
over
the
same
side
in
an
attempt
to
help
her
they
upset
if
they
are
careful
penny
groaned
yes
there
they
go
even
as
she
spoke
the
canoe
flipped
over
tossing
the
three
girls
into
the
water
two
of
them
grasped
the
overturned
craft
and
held
on
the
third
unable
to
swim
was
too
far
away
to
reach
the
extended
hand
of
her
terrified
companions
making
inarticulate
strangled
sounds
in
her
throat
she
frantically
thrashed
the
water
trying
desperately
to
save
herself
chapter
question
of
quick
sally
cried
remaining
at
the
tiller
of
the
the
life
preserver
finding
one
under
the
seat
penny
took
careful
aim
and
hurled
it
in
a
high
arc
over
the
span
of
water
the
throw
was
nearly
perfect
and
the
life
preserver
plopped
heavily
on
the
surface
not
two
feet
from
the
struggling
girl
but
she
was
too
to
reach
out
and
grasp
it
the
river
current
carried
the
preserver
downstream
sally
knew
then
that
to
save
the
girl
she
must
turn
aside
and
abandon
the
race
coming
about
she
called
sharply
to
warn
penny
of
the
swinging
boom
already
beyond
the
girl
whose
struggles
were
becoming
weaker
they
turned
and
sailed
directly
toward
her
penny
kicked
off
her
shoes
and
before
sally
could
protest
dived
over
the
gunwale
a
half
dozen
long
strokes
carried
her
directly
behind
the
struggling
girl
hooking
a
hand
beneath
her
chin
she
pulled
her
into
a
firm
safe
hold
then
towed
her
to
the
where
sally
helped
them
both
aboard
throughout
the
rescue
the
other
two
children
had
clung
to
the
overturned
canoe
sally
saw
that
they
were
in
no
danger
for
a
motorboat
from
shore
was
plowing
swiftly
to
the
rescue
standing
by
until
the
two
were
taken
safely
aboard
she
then
glanced
toward
the
fleet
of
racing
boats
nearly
all
of
them
had
passed
the
and
were
well
on
their
way
toward
the
second
marker
the
led
the
field
we
out
of
the
race
she
said
dismally
no
do
give
up
penny
pleaded
you
still
may
have
a
chance
this
girl
is
all
right
i
look
after
her
while
you
sail
sally
remained
unconvinced
we
could
possibly
overtake
jack
now
but
we
do
have
a
chance
to
come
in
among
the
five
leaders
then
you
would
be
able
to
race
in
the
finals
you
would
lose
the
lantern
trophy
sparkle
came
into
sally
eyes
again
her
lips
drew
into
a
tight
determined
line
all
right
we
keep
on
she
decided
but
it
will
be
nip
and
tuck
to
win
even
fifth
place
see
what
you
can
do
for
our
passenger
the
girl
who
had
been
hauled
aboard
was
not
more
than
thirteen
years
old
although
conscious
she
had
swallowed
considerable
water
and
was
dazed
from
the
experience
as
she
began
to
stir
penny
knelt
beside
her
lie
still
she
said
soothingly
we
have
you
at
the
dock
soon
stripping
off
her
own
jacket
penny
tucked
it
about
the
shivering
child
we
balanced
badly
sally
commented
her
eyes
on
the
line
of
boats
far
ahead
and
overloaded
too
it
foolish
to
try
no
it
is
penny
said
firmly
we
sailing
great
guns
sally
look
at
the
water
boiling
behind
our
rudder
almost
as
if
it
were
driven
by
a
motor
the
plowed
through
the
waves
leaving
a
trail
of
foam
and
bubbles
in
her
wake
despite
the
handicap
of
an
extra
passenger
the
boat
was
gaining
on
the
contestants
ahead
if
only
the
course
were
longer
sally
murmured
straining
against
the
pull
of
the
main
sheet
they
rounded
the
second
marker
only
a
few
feet
behind
a
group
of
bunched
boats
one
by
one
they
passed
them
until
only
seven
remained
ahead
but
with
the
finish
line
close
by
they
could
not
seem
to
gain
another
inch
we
ca
make
it
sally
said
turning
to
gaze
at
the
shore
with
its
crowd
of
excited
spectators
we
bound
to
finish
seventh
or
eighth
out
of
the
race
we
still
footing
faster
than
the
other
boats
penny
observed
give
up
yet
a
moment
later
the
crack
of
a
revolver
sounding
over
the
water
told
the
girls
that
the
had
crossed
the
finish
line
in
first
place
to
add
to
sally
difficulties
the
rescued
girl
began
to
stir
and
rock
the
boat
each
time
she
moved
the
lost
pace
though
they
passed
the
next
two
boats
they
could
not
gain
to
any
extent
on
the
one
which
seemed
destined
to
finish
in
fifth
place
sally
had
been
right
penny
realized
barring
a
miracle
the
could
not
be
among
the
winners
although
they
were
slowly
gaining
the
finish
line
was
too
close
for
them
to
overcome
the
lead
of
the
remaining
boats
and
then
the
miracle
occurred
the
directly
ahead
seemed
to
falter
and
to
turn
slightly
aside
the
seized
the
chance
and
forged
even
go
to
it
sally
her
skipper
tom
evans
a
freckled
youth
called
you
belong
in
the
finals
then
the
girls
understood
and
were
grateful
deliberately
the
boy
had
slowed
his
boat
so
that
sally
might
be
among
the
winners
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
do
sally
whispered
but
how
i
hate
to
win
in
such
fashion
tom
evans
knew
he
had
no
chance
in
the
finals
penny
said
as
he
said
you
belong
there
for
you
are
one
of
the
best
sailors
in
the
fleet
sally
crossed
the
finish
line
in
fifth
place
then
sailed
on
to
the
dock
by
the
clubhouse
as
penny
leaped
out
to
make
the
boat
fast
willing
hands
assisted
with
the
bedraggled
passenger
the
child
was
taken
to
the
clubhouse
for
a
change
of
clothes
officials
gathered
about
penny
and
sally
congratulating
them
upon
the
race
i
did
really
win
the
latter
said
paying
tribute
to
tom
evans
the
deliberately
turned
aside
to
give
me
a
chance
to
pass
nearby
jack
gandiss
who
had
won
the
race
stood
unnoticed
after
awhile
he
walked
over
to
the
dock
where
sally
and
penny
were
collecting
their
belongings
that
was
a
nice
rescue
he
said
diffidently
of
course
it
cost
you
second
place
which
was
a
pity
sally
cocked
an
eyebrow
place
she
repeated
well
i
like
that
you
never
could
have
defeated
the
no
well
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
the
was
leading
when
i
had
to
turn
aside
not
that
i
was
glad
to
do
it
you
may
have
been
ahead
but
i
was
coming
up
fast
i
would
have
overtaken
you
at
the
second
marker
or
sooner
children
children
interposed
penny
as
she
neatly
folded
a
sail
and
slipped
it
into
a
snowy
white
cover
must
you
always
claw
at
each
other
why
we
are
fighting
sally
denied
with
a
grin
heck
no
jack
agreed
he
started
away
then
turned
and
came
back
by
the
way
sally
how
about
the
trophy
sally
did
not
understand
what
he
meant
i
won
the
race
so
does
the
brass
lantern
belong
to
me
jack
pursued
the
subject
well
it
will
if
you
win
the
final
next
week
that
in
the
bag
like
fun
it
is
sally
said
indignantly
jack
i
hate
to
crush
those
delicate
feelings
of
yours
but
you
due
for
the
worst
defeat
of
your
life
the
argument
might
have
started
anew
but
jack
reverted
to
the
matter
of
the
lantern
trophy
i
the
winner
now
and
it
should
be
turned
over
to
me
he
insisted
sally
became
annoyed
that
not
according
to
the
rules
of
the
competition
she
returned
the
regulations
governing
the
race
say
that
the
winner
is
entitled
to
keep
the
trophy
i
was
last
winner
the
one
this
season
has
yet
been
determined
it
not
safe
to
keep
the
lantern
aboard
the
do
be
silly
there
could
be
a
safer
place
pop
and
i
chained
the
trophy
to
a
beam
it
ca
be
removed
without
cutting
the
chain
someone
could
take
the
trophy
by
unlocking
the
padlock
oh
no
they
could
sally
grinned
provokingly
you
see
already
lost
the
key
the
only
way
that
lantern
can
be
removed
is
by
cutting
the
chain
jack
was
enraged
you
lost
the
key
he
demanded
if
that
is
the
last
straw
hanson
brown
chairman
of
the
racing
committee
chanced
to
be
passing
and
jack
impulsively
hailed
him
to
the
chagrin
of
the
girls
he
asked
for
a
ruling
on
the
matter
of
the
trophy
possession
why
i
do
recall
that
such
a
question
ever
came
up
before
the
official
replied
my
judgment
is
that
miss
barker
has
a
right
to
retain
the
trophy
until
the
final
race
ha
chuckled
sally
enjoying
jack
discomfiture
how
do
you
like
that
jack
turned
to
leave
but
he
could
not
refrain
from
one
parting
shot
all
right
he
said
you
get
to
keep
the
trophy
but
mind
if
anything
should
happen
to
it
you
alone
will
be
responsible
chapter
when
penny
her
father
and
the
gandiss
family
returned
late
that
afternoon
to
shadow
island
a
strange
motorboat
was
tied
up
at
the
dock
on
the
veranda
a
man
sat
waiting
although
his
face
appeared
familiar
penny
did
not
recognize
him
her
father
however
spoke
his
name
instantly
heiney
growski
anything
to
report
penny
remembered
then
that
he
was
the
detective
who
had
been
placed
in
charge
of
the
junk
shop
near
the
gandiss
factory
the
man
arose
laying
aside
a
newspaper
he
had
been
reading
to
pass
the
time
i
learned
a
little
he
replied
to
parker
question
shall
we
talk
here
go
ahead
encouraged
gandiss
carelessly
this
is
my
son
jack
and
our
guest
penny
parker
they
know
of
the
situation
at
the
factory
and
can
be
trusted
not
to
talk
though
seemingly
reluctant
to
make
a
report
in
the
presence
of
the
two
youngsters
the
detective
nevertheless
obeyed
instructions
since
opening
up
the
shop
i
been
approached
twice
by
a
man
from
the
factory
he
began
that
sweeper
called
joe
interposed
parker
yes
the
first
time
he
merely
came
into
the
place
looked
around
a
bit
and
finally
asked
me
what
i
paid
for
brass
you
did
appear
too
interested
parker
inquired
no
i
gave
him
a
price
just
a
little
above
the
market
how
did
it
strike
him
he
did
have
much
to
say
but
i
could
tell
he
was
interested
did
he
offer
you
any
brass
no
he
hinted
he
might
be
able
to
get
me
a
considerable
quantity
of
it
later
on
feeling
you
out
yes
i
figure
he
be
back
that
why
i
came
here
for
instructions
if
he
shows
up
with
the
brass
shall
i
have
him
arrested
parker
waited
for
the
factory
owner
to
answer
the
question
make
a
record
of
every
transaction
gandiss
said
encourage
the
man
to
talk
and
he
may
reveal
the
names
of
others
mixed
up
in
the
thefts
but
make
no
arrests
until
we
have
more
information
very
good
sir
the
detective
returned
unless
the
man
is
very
crafty
i
believe
we
may
be
able
to
trap
him
within
a
few
weeks
after
heiney
had
gone
jack
and
penny
went
down
to
the
dock
together
to
retie
the
the
wind
had
shifted
and
with
the
water
level
rising
the
boat
was
bumping
against
its
mooring
post
by
the
way
jack
said
penny
as
she
unfastened
one
of
the
ropes
to
make
it
shorter
i
forgot
to
congratulate
you
upon
winning
the
race
this
afternoon
skip
it
he
replied
grimly
penny
glanced
at
him
wondering
if
her
ears
had
deceived
her
why
i
thought
you
were
to
win
she
commented
not
that
way
jack
kept
his
face
averted
as
he
tied
a
neat
clove
hitch
i
guess
i
made
myself
look
like
a
heel
did
i
for
the
first
time
penny
really
felt
sorry
for
the
boy
resisting
a
temptation
to
rub
salt
in
his
wounds
she
said
kindly
well
i
suppose
you
felt
justified
in
asking
for
the
trophy
i
wish
i
had
done
that
penny
it
just
that
sally
gets
me
sometimes
she
so
blamed
cocky
and
she
feels
the
same
way
about
you
on
the
whole
though
i
wonder
if
sally
has
had
a
square
deal
jack
straightened
staring
at
the
which
tugged
impatiently
at
her
shortened
ropes
waves
were
beginning
to
lap
over
the
dock
boards
you
mean
about
the
factory
he
asked
in
a
subdued
voice
penny
nodded
i
never
did
think
sally
was
a
thief
jack
said
slowly
judging
from
heiney
growski
report
someone
may
have
planted
the
brass
in
her
locker
probably
that
fellow
joe
the
sweeper
do
you
feel
she
should
be
cleared
how
can
we
do
anything
without
proof
this
fellow
joe
is
convicted
yet
besides
he
only
one
of
a
gang
sally
could
be
involved
though
i
doubt
it
you
not
really
convinced
then
penny
gazed
at
him
curiously
yes
i
am
jack
answered
after
a
slight
hesitation
sally
innocent
i
know
that
then
why
do
we
do
something
about
it
what
my
father
has
employed
the
best
detectives
already
at
least
you
could
tell
sally
how
you
feel
about
it
jack
kicked
at
the
dock
post
with
the
toe
of
his
tennis
shoe
and
have
her
tear
into
me
like
a
wild
cat
he
countered
you
do
know
sally
are
you
so
sure
that
you
do
penny
asked
turning
she
walked
swiftly
away
jack
came
padding
up
the
gravel
path
after
her
wait
he
commanded
grasping
her
by
the
arm
so
you
think
i
given
sally
a
raw
deal
i
have
no
opinion
in
the
matter
penny
returned
deliberately
aloof
if
i
could
do
anything
to
prove
sally
innocent
you
know
i
jump
at
the
chance
jack
argued
trying
to
regain
penny
good
graces
you
really
mean
that
yes
i
do
then
why
do
you
try
to
get
a
little
evidence
against
this
man
joe
the
sweeper
penny
proposed
eagerly
you
visit
the
factory
nearly
every
day
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
and
see
what
you
can
learn
everyone
knows
who
i
am
jack
argued
there
would
be
a
chance
meeting
penny
steady
appraising
gaze
he
broke
off
and
finished
oh
okay
i
do
what
i
can
but
it
useless
not
if
you
have
a
plan
jack
stared
at
penny
with
sudden
suspicion
say
what
are
you
leading
up
to
anyhow
he
demanded
do
have
one
not
exactly
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
by
watching
at
the
gate
of
the
factory
when
the
employes
leave
one
might
spot
some
of
the
men
who
are
carrying
off
brass
in
their
clothing
jack
gave
an
amused
snort
oh
that
been
done
company
detectives
made
any
number
of
checks
that
just
the
point
penny
argued
they
were
factory
employes
probably
known
to
some
of
the
workers
i
even
more
widely
recognized
jack
said
besides
clayton
our
gateman
has
instructions
to
be
on
the
watch
for
anyone
who
might
try
to
carry
anything
away
he
reported
several
persons
when
they
were
searched
nothing
was
found
your
gateman
is
entirely
trustworthy
why
not
he
an
old
employee
penny
said
no
more
though
she
was
thinking
of
the
conversation
overheard
while
at
the
factory
gatehouse
even
if
jack
took
no
interest
she
decided
she
would
try
to
do
what
she
could
herself
but
there
really
seemed
no
place
to
begin
if
you
get
any
good
ideas
i
be
glad
to
help
jack
said
as
if
reading
her
thoughts
just
to
barge
ahead
without
any
plan
does
make
sense
to
me
penny
knew
that
he
was
right
much
as
she
desired
to
help
clear
sally
she
had
no
definite
scheme
in
mind
as
the
pair
turned
to
leave
the
docks
they
heard
a
shout
from
across
the
water
the
with
canvas
spread
wide
was
sailing
before
the
wind
directly
toward
the
island
sally
at
the
tiller
signaled
that
she
wanted
to
talk
to
them
the
boat
came
in
like
a
house
afire
but
though
the
landing
was
fast
it
was
skillful
sally
looped
a
rope
around
the
dock
post
but
did
not
bother
to
tie
up
penny
she
said
breathlessly
i
did
get
half
a
chance
to
thank
you
this
afternoon
for
helping
me
in
the
race
i
did
do
anything
penny
laughed
i
merely
went
along
for
the
ride
that
may
be
your
story
but
everyone
who
saw
the
race
knows
better
what
i
really
came
here
for
is
to
ask
you
to
spend
the
night
with
me
aboard
the
we
have
a
chance
to
get
better
acquainted
the
invitation
caught
penny
by
surprise
sally
mistook
her
hesitation
for
reluctance
probably
you
do
feel
you
want
to
leave
here
she
said
quickly
it
was
just
one
of
those
sudden
ideas
of
mine
i
want
to
come
penny
answered
eagerly
if
and
gandiss
would
mind
wait
and
i
ask
darting
to
the
house
she
talked
over
the
matter
with
her
father
and
then
with
her
hostess
by
all
means
go
the
latter
urged
i
imagine
you
will
enjoy
the
experience
jack
can
pick
you
up
in
the
motorboat
in
the
morning
packing
her
pajamas
and
a
few
toilet
articles
into
a
tight
roll
penny
ran
back
to
the
dock
jack
and
sally
were
arguing
about
details
of
the
afternoon
race
but
they
abandoned
the
battle
as
she
hurried
up
jack
you
to
pick
me
up
tomorrow
morning
she
advised
him
as
she
climbed
aboard
the
do
forget
the
already
had
been
anchored
for
the
night
in
a
quiet
cove
half
a
mile
down
river
with
darkness
approaching
lights
were
winking
all
along
the
shore
across
the
river
the
gandiss
factory
was
a
blaze
of
white
illumination
farther
downstream
the
colored
lights
of
an
amusement
park
with
a
high
roller
coaster
cut
a
bright
pattern
in
the
sky
sally
glanced
for
a
moment
toward
the
factory
but
made
no
mention
of
her
unpleasant
experience
there
pop
and
i
stay
alone
at
night
on
the
she
explained
as
they
approached
the
ferry
our
crew
is
made
up
of
men
who
live
in
town
so
usually
they
go
home
after
the
six
run
skillfully
bringing
the
alongside
the
anchored
she
shouted
for
her
father
to
help
penny
up
the
ladder
making
the
smaller
craft
secure
for
the
night
she
followed
her
to
the
deck
what
cooking
pop
she
asked
sniffing
the
air
catfish
the
captain
answered
as
he
went
aft
better
get
to
the
galley
and
tend
to
it
or
we
may
not
have
any
supper
the
catfish
sizzling
in
butter
was
on
the
verge
of
scorching
sally
jerked
the
pan
from
the
stove
and
then
with
penny
help
set
a
little
table
which
swung
down
from
the
cabin
wall
and
prepared
the
remainder
of
the
meal
supper
was
not
elaborate
but
penny
thought
she
had
never
tasted
better
food
the
catfish
was
crisp
and
brown
and
there
were
french
fried
potatoes
and
a
salad
to
go
with
it
for
dessert
captain
barker
brought
a
huge
watermelon
from
the
refrigerator
and
they
split
it
three
ways
it
fun
living
on
a
ferryboat
penny
declared
enthusiastically
as
she
and
sally
washed
the
dishes
i
ca
see
why
you
ever
would
want
to
work
in
a
factory
when
you
can
live
such
a
carefree
life
here
the
remark
was
carelessly
made
penny
regretted
it
instantly
for
she
saw
the
smile
leave
sally
face
i
worked
at
the
factory
because
i
wanted
to
help
make
airplanes
and
because
pop
ca
afford
to
give
me
much
money
she
explained
quietly
it
was
all
a
mistake
i
realize
that
now
i
sorry
penny
apologized
squeezing
her
hand
i
did
mean
to
be
so
stupid
as
far
as
your
discharge
is
concerned
you
be
cleared
how
gandiss
has
detectives
working
on
the
case
detectives
sally
gave
a
snort
of
disgust
why
everyone
in
the
plant
knows
who
they
are
after
dishes
were
done
the
girls
went
on
deck
protected
from
the
night
breezes
by
warm
lap
rugs
they
sat
listening
to
the
lallup
of
the
waves
against
the
captain
barker
pipe
kept
the
mosquitoes
away
and
he
talked
reminiscently
of
his
days
as
a
boy
on
the
waterfront
presently
the
blast
of
a
motorboat
engine
cut
the
stillness
of
the
night
sally
straightening
in
her
chair
listened
intently
there
goes
jack
again
she
observed
glancing
at
her
father
to
the
harpers
no
doubt
the
light
of
the
boat
became
visible
and
sally
followed
it
with
her
eyes
as
it
slowly
chugged
upstream
i
was
right
she
exclaimed
a
moment
later
penny
curiosity
was
aroused
for
she
knew
that
jack
absented
himself
from
home
nearly
every
night
and
that
his
actions
were
a
cause
of
worry
to
his
parents
who
are
the
harpers
she
inquired
oh
they
live
across
the
river
where
you
see
those
red
and
blue
lights
sally
said
pointing
beyond
the
railing
the
house
stands
on
stilts
over
the
water
and
is
a
meeting
place
for
the
scum
of
the
city
sally
her
father
reproved
well
it
the
truth
ma
harper
and
her
husband
claude
run
an
outdoor
dance
pavilion
but
their
income
is
derived
from
other
sources
too
black
market
sales
for
instance
sally
your
tongue
is
rattling
like
a
chain
pop
you
know
very
well
the
harpers
are
trash
nevertheless
do
make
statements
you
ca
prove
sally
outspoken
remarks
worried
penny
because
of
their
bearing
upon
gandiss
son
you
do
think
jack
is
mixed
up
with
the
harpers
in
black
market
dealings
she
asked
oh
no
sally
got
up
from
the
deck
chair
he
goes
there
to
have
a
good
time
and
if
you
ask
me
jack
ought
to
stop
being
a
playboy
grasshopper
captain
barker
knocked
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
put
it
deep
in
his
jacket
pocket
the
shoe
pinches
he
told
penny
with
a
wink
sally
never
learned
to
dance
i
hear
tell
there
a
girl
who
goes
to
the
harper
shindigs
that
an
expert
at
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
sally
said
furiously
i
going
to
bed
captain
barker
arose
heavily
from
his
chair
how
about
the
passenger
receipts
he
asked
locked
in
the
cabin
safe
yes
we
took
in
more
than
two
hundred
dollars
today
that
makes
over
five
hundred
in
the
safe
the
captain
said
frowning
you
have
to
take
it
to
the
bank
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
like
to
have
so
much
cash
aboard
going
to
the
cabin
they
were
to
share
sally
and
penny
undressed
and
tumbled
into
the
beds
the
gentle
motion
of
the
boat
and
the
slap
of
waves
on
the
hull
quickly
lulled
them
to
sleep
how
long
penny
slumbered
she
did
not
know
but
toward
morning
she
awoke
in
darkness
to
find
sally
shaking
her
arm
what
is
it
penny
mumbled
drowsily
time
to
get
up
sh
sally
warned
do
make
a
sound
penny
sat
up
in
the
bunk
her
friend
she
saw
had
started
to
dress
i
think
someone
is
trying
to
get
aboard
sally
whispered
listen
penny
could
hear
no
unusual
sound
only
the
wash
of
the
waves
i
distinctly
heard
a
boat
grate
against
the
only
a
moment
ago
sally
pulled
on
her
slacks
and
thrust
her
feet
into
slippers
which
would
make
no
sound
i
going
on
deck
to
investigate
penny
was
out
of
bed
in
a
flash
wait
she
commanded
i
going
with
you
dressing
with
nervous
haste
she
tiptoed
to
the
cabin
door
with
sally
stealing
through
the
dark
corridors
to
the
companionway
they
could
hear
no
unusual
sound
but
midway
up
the
steps
sally
keen
ears
heard
movement
someone
is
in
the
lounge
she
whispered
it
may
be
pop
but
i
think
so
come
on
and
we
see
chapter
stolen
hand
in
hand
the
two
girls
tiptoed
to
the
entranceway
of
the
lounge
distinctly
they
could
hear
someone
moving
about
in
the
darkness
and
the
sound
came
from
the
direction
of
a
small
cabin
which
the
barkers
used
as
an
office
room
pop
sally
called
sharply
is
that
you
she
was
answered
only
by
complete
silence
then
a
plank
creaked
the
prowler
was
stealing
stealthily
toward
the
girls
pop
shouted
sally
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
groping
to
find
a
light
switch
before
she
could
illuminate
the
room
a
man
brushed
past
the
two
girls
penny
seized
him
by
the
coat
a
sharp
object
pierced
her
finger
she
was
thrust
back
against
the
wall
so
hard
that
it
knocked
the
breath
from
her
the
man
twisted
and
jerking
his
coat
free
dashed
up
the
stairs
pop
sally
called
again
captain
barker
armed
with
revolver
and
flashlight
came
out
of
his
cabin
by
this
time
sally
had
found
and
turned
on
the
light
switch
a
prowler
she
cried
he
ran
up
on
deck
stay
below
ordered
the
captain
i
get
him
penny
and
sally
had
no
intention
of
missing
any
of
the
excitement
close
at
captain
barker
heels
they
darted
up
the
companionway
to
the
deck
to
the
starboard
the
trio
heard
a
slight
splash
then
the
sound
of
steady
dipping
oars
someone
getting
away
in
a
rowboat
sally
cried
captain
barker
ran
to
the
railing
halt
he
shouted
halt
or
fire
the
man
a
mere
shadow
in
the
mist
arising
from
the
river
rowed
faster
captain
barker
fired
two
shots
purposely
high
the
man
ducked
down
into
the
boat
and
a
moment
later
switched
on
an
outboard
motor
which
rapidly
carried
him
beyond
view
did
you
see
who
the
fellow
was
sally
the
captain
demanded
wrathfully
no
it
was
too
dark
do
you
think
he
got
away
with
the
money
in
the
safe
fearing
the
worst
the
trio
descended
to
an
office
room
adjoining
the
passenger
lounge
a
chair
had
been
overturned
there
but
the
door
of
the
safe
remained
locked
you
girls
must
have
surprised
him
before
he
had
time
to
steal
the
money
captain
barker
declared
in
relief
no
harm
done
but
this
is
the
first
time
in
six
years
that
anyone
tried
to
sneak
aboard
the
we
have
to
keep
a
better
watch
from
now
on
as
the
girls
turned
to
leave
the
cabin
sally
saw
that
penny
was
looking
at
the
third
finger
of
her
right
hand
why
you
hurt
she
cried
penny
hand
was
smeared
with
blood
which
came
from
a
tiny
wound
on
the
finger
it
nothing
she
insisted
sally
ran
to
a
cabinet
for
gauze
iodine
and
cotton
how
did
it
happen
she
asked
i
tried
to
stop
the
prowler
as
i
grabbed
his
coat
something
stuck
my
finger
it
must
have
been
a
pin
the
wound
was
superficial
and
did
not
pain
penny
sally
wrapped
the
finger
for
her
and
then
after
captain
barker
had
said
he
would
remain
up
for
awhile
they
returned
to
bed
throughout
the
night
there
were
no
further
disturbances
at
dawn
the
girls
arose
feeling
only
a
little
tired
as
the
result
of
their
adventure
they
had
time
for
a
quick
swim
in
the
river
before
breakfast
and
disgraced
themselves
by
eating
six
pancakes
each
the
crew
will
be
coming
aboard
soon
sally
said
glancing
at
her
watch
i
usually
sweep
out
the
lounge
and
straighten
up
a
bit
before
we
make
our
first
passenger
run
penny
who
had
nothing
to
do
until
jack
could
come
to
take
her
back
to
the
island
eagerly
offered
to
help
armed
with
brooms
and
dust
rags
the
girls
went
below
in
the
doorway
penny
paused
staring
at
the
overhead
beam
why
sally
she
commented
in
astonishment
what
did
you
do
with
the
lantern
trophy
take
it
down
no
it
still
there
alarmed
by
penny
question
sally
moved
past
her
gazing
at
the
beam
where
the
brass
lantern
had
hung
there
now
was
only
a
neatly
severed
chain
why
it
gone
she
exclaimed
in
disbelief
was
it
here
last
night
when
we
went
to
bed
of
course
then
it
was
stolen
last
night
dropping
broom
and
dustpan
sally
brought
a
chair
and
inspected
the
chain
obviously
it
had
been
cut
by
sharp
metal
scissors
that
prowler
who
came
aboard
last
night
must
have
done
it
she
exclaimed
angrily
oh
what
a
mean
low
trick
as
the
full
realization
of
what
the
loss
would
mean
came
to
her
sally
sank
down
on
the
chair
a
picture
of
dejection
i
responsible
for
the
trophy
penny
i
be
expected
to
produce
it
before
the
final
race
oh
what
can
we
do
why
do
you
suppose
the
thief
took
the
lantern
and
nothing
else
someone
may
have
done
it
for
pure
spite
but
i
more
inclined
to
think
the
person
came
aboard
to
steal
our
money
in
the
office
safe
the
lantern
hung
here
in
a
conspicuous
place
and
he
may
have
taken
it
on
impulse
intending
to
notify
captain
barker
of
the
loss
the
girls
started
up
the
companionway
abruptly
penny
paused
her
attention
drawn
to
an
object
lying
on
one
of
the
steps
it
was
a
circular
badge
with
a
picture
and
a
number
on
it
no
name
such
identifications
she
knew
were
used
by
many
industrial
plants
where
did
this
come
from
she
murmured
picking
it
up
the
face
on
the
badge
was
unfamiliar
to
her
the
man
had
dark
bushy
hair
sunken
eyes
and
prominent
cheekbones
sally
turned
to
examine
the
identification
pin
why
this
badge
came
from
the
gandiss
factory
she
exclaimed
and
studied
the
picture
intently
did
you
ever
see
the
man
before
i
ca
place
him
penny
yet
i
know
i
have
seen
him
somewhere
the
man
should
be
easy
to
trace
from
this
picture
and
number
when
i
caught
hold
of
his
clothing
last
night
i
must
have
pulled
off
the
pin
that
was
how
my
finger
was
pricked
as
the
girls
examined
the
pin
they
heard
a
commotion
on
deck
and
the
sound
of
voices
before
they
could
go
up
the
steps
to
investigate
jack
gandiss
came
clattering
down
to
the
lounge
i
came
to
take
you
back
to
the
island
penny
he
informed
ready
then
his
gaze
fastened
upon
the
beam
where
the
brass
lantern
had
hung
say
what
became
of
the
trophy
he
demanded
sharply
you
decided
to
take
it
down
after
all
it
gone
sally
said
misery
in
her
voice
stolen
the
two
girls
waited
for
the
explosion
but
strangely
jack
said
nothing
for
a
moment
you
warned
me
sally
hastened
on
oh
it
all
my
fault
it
was
conceited
and
selfish
of
me
to
display
the
trophy
here
i
deserve
everything
you
going
to
say
still
jack
remained
mute
staring
at
the
beam
go
on
tell
me
what
you
thinking
sally
challenged
miserably
it
a
tough
break
jack
said
without
rancor
this
will
practically
ruin
the
race
sally
accused
herself
i
replace
the
trophy
for
there
no
other
like
it
an
ordinary
cup
never
would
seem
the
same
that
so
jack
gloomily
agreed
well
if
it
gone
it
gone
and
there
nothing
more
to
be
done
the
boy
calm
acceptance
of
the
calamity
he
had
predicted
astonished
penny
and
sally
was
this
the
jack
they
knew
with
a
perfect
opportunity
to
say
i
told
you
so
he
had
withheld
blame
sally
sank
down
on
the
lower
step
how
will
i
face
the
racing
committee
she
murmured
what
will
the
other
contestants
say
feel
like
running
me
out
of
town
maybe
it
wo
be
necessary
to
tell
jack
said
slowly
one
of
us
is
almost
certain
to
win
the
race
next
friday
yes
that
true
but
if
you
win
the
lantern
would
be
yours
for
keeps
should
i
win
no
one
would
need
to
know
that
you
had
turned
it
over
to
me
you
could
make
some
excuse
at
the
time
of
the
presentation
sally
gazed
at
jack
with
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
i
truly
sorry
for
all
the
hateful
things
i
said
to
you
in
the
past
she
declared
earnestly
you
a
true
blue
friend
maybe
i
sorry
about
some
of
the
cracks
i
made
too
he
grinned
extending
his
hand
shake
sally
sprang
up
and
grasped
the
hand
firmly
but
her
eyes
were
misty
she
hastened
to
correct
any
wrong
impression
jack
might
have
gained
i
glad
you
made
the
offer
you
did
she
said
but
i
never
would
dream
of
keeping
the
truth
from
the
committee
i
notify
them
today
why
be
in
such
a
hurry
penny
asked
the
race
is
a
week
away
in
that
time
we
may
be
able
to
find
the
trophy
after
all
we
have
a
good
clue
what
clue
asked
jack
penny
showed
him
the
pin
as
he
gazed
at
the
picture
on
the
face
of
the
badge
a
strange
expression
came
into
his
eyes
you
know
the
man
penny
asked
instantly
he
works
at
our
factory
but
that
not
where
i
seen
him
at
the
harpers
sally
asked
yes
jack
admitted
unwillingly
i
do
know
his
name
but
he
is
a
friend
of
ma
harper
and
her
husband
and
of
that
joe
the
sweeper
i
do
know
about
that
the
questioning
had
made
jack
uncomfortable
the
man
should
be
arrested
we
have
no
proof
sally
penny
pointed
out
while
we
satisfied
in
our
own
minds
that
the
man
who
took
the
lantern
is
the
person
who
lost
the
badge
we
ca
be
certain
the
badge
may
have
been
dropped
by
a
passenger
yesterday
jack
added
let
me
find
out
this
fellow
name
first
and
a
few
facts
about
him
i
do
believe
your
friends
the
harpers
will
tell
you
much
sally
said
stiffly
they
the
scum
of
the
waterfront
how
you
can
go
there
penny
who
saw
that
another
storm
was
brewing
quickly
intervened
saying
it
was
time
she
and
jack
started
for
the
island
sally
taking
the
hint
allowed
the
subject
to
drop
but
as
she
went
on
deck
to
see
the
pair
off
in
jack
motorboat
she
whispered
to
penny
see
me
this
afternoon
if
you
can
i
have
an
idea
i
do
want
jack
to
know
about
if
we
work
together
we
may
be
able
to
trace
the
trophy
chapter
jack
had
little
to
say
about
the
theft
as
he
and
penny
returned
to
the
gandiss
home
however
after
lunch
he
offered
to
go
to
his
factory
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
employee
who
had
lost
the
badge
aboard
the
want
to
come
along
he
invited
ordinarily
penny
would
have
welcomed
the
opportunity
but
remembering
that
sally
had
wished
to
see
her
she
regretfully
turned
down
the
invitation
i
ride
across
the
river
if
you
do
mind
she
said
i
have
an
errand
in
town
by
this
time
penny
was
familiar
with
the
daily
route
of
the
and
knew
where
it
would
dock
to
pick
up
and
unload
passengers
sally
she
felt
certain
would
be
aboard
expecting
her
they
crossed
the
river
in
the
motorboat
making
an
appointment
to
meet
again
at
four
after
jack
had
gone
penny
set
off
for
the
dock
where
a
sizable
group
of
passengers
awaited
the
ferry
soon
the
steamed
in
her
bell
signaling
a
landing
passengers
crowded
the
railing
eager
to
be
the
first
off
a
crewman
stood
at
the
wheel
and
sally
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
as
the
boat
brushed
the
dock
sailors
leaped
off
to
make
fast
to
the
dock
posts
captain
barker
annoyed
because
the
passengers
were
pushing
bellowed
impatient
orders
to
his
men
all
right
start
that
gangplank
forward
lively
are
you
going
to
sleep
over
it
all
day
then
seeing
penny
he
raised
his
hand
in
friendly
greeting
is
sally
aboard
she
called
to
him
no
she
went
up
the
shore
a
ways
did
say
where
the
captain
replied
waving
his
hand
upriver
ought
to
be
back
here
any
minute
sally
however
did
not
appear
and
the
pulled
away
without
her
penny
loitered
on
the
dock
for
twenty
minutes
the
sun
was
hot
and
with
nothing
to
do
time
lay
heavy
upon
her
it
lacked
a
half
hour
before
the
would
return
and
fully
two
hours
before
she
was
due
to
meet
jack
for
lack
of
occupation
she
walked
upriver
along
the
docks
buildings
were
few
and
far
between
there
were
several
fish
houses
a
boat
rental
place
and
the
amusement
park
the
beach
beyond
made
easy
walking
so
penny
kept
on
with
quickening
interest
she
saw
that
she
was
approaching
a
building
which
appeared
to
stand
on
stilts
over
the
water
close
by
was
a
large
smoothly
cemented
area
with
overhead
lights
that
the
harper
place
penny
recognized
it
with
the
dance
area
adjoining
she
moved
on
along
the
beach
drawing
closer
to
the
building
she
passed
a
clump
of
bushes
fringing
the
sand
the
leaves
stirred
slightly
though
there
was
no
breeze
penny
failed
to
notice
the
movement
but
as
she
passed
the
bushes
a
hand
reached
out
and
grasped
her
ankle
startled
penny
uttered
a
nervous
cry
be
quiet
you
goon
a
familiar
voice
bade
it
was
sally
barker
crouched
amid
the
foliage
quickly
she
pulled
penny
with
her
behind
the
bushes
sally
what
are
you
doing
here
penny
demanded
watching
that
house
i
saw
you
a
long
way
down
the
beach
anything
doing
a
boat
is
coming
in
now
that
why
i
did
want
you
to
be
seen
a
rowboat
with
an
outboard
rapidly
approached
the
harper
pier
already
it
was
making
a
wide
sweep
preparatory
to
a
landing
why
it
that
fellow
joe
the
sweeper
penny
exclaimed
peering
out
from
the
hiding
place
who
is
steering
the
boat
claude
harper
sally
revealed
ma
harper
husband
wonder
what
joe
would
be
doing
here
that
what
i
like
to
know
myself
sally
returned
grimly
joe
as
stupid
as
he
given
credit
for
being
he
crafty
and
mean
and
being
mixed
up
with
the
harpers
is
no
recommendation
while
the
girls
watched
the
boat
landed
the
two
men
tied
up
the
craft
and
removing
a
burlap
sack
which
apparently
was
filled
with
something
heavy
carried
it
into
the
house
i
wish
we
knew
what
they
brought
here
penny
said
why
not
try
to
find
out
how
could
we
sneak
up
to
the
house
and
peek
in
one
of
the
windows
we
might
be
caught
true
but
we
learn
nothing
more
here
debating
a
moment
the
girls
emerged
from
their
hiding
place
to
reach
the
house
they
were
compelled
to
cross
an
open
stretch
of
beach
however
no
one
was
to
be
seen
outside
the
dwelling
and
their
arrival
appeared
to
attract
no
notice
of
anyone
inside
how
about
that
window
at
the
east
side
penny
suggested
the
one
she
pointed
out
was
half
screened
by
bushes
and
at
a
level
which
would
permit
them
to
peer
inside
okay
agreed
sally
but
i
hate
to
be
caught
at
this
business
the
harpers
hate
me
and
they
would
be
mighty
unpleasant
if
they
came
upon
us
snooping
what
a
harsh
word
chuckled
penny
all
this
comes
under
the
heading
of
investigation
the
only
difference
is
that
gandiss
detectives
are
paid
and
we
are
if
i
could
get
the
brass
lantern
back
that
would
be
pay
enough
for
me
sally
returned
creeping
to
the
window
the
girls
cautiously
peeped
into
the
house
the
panes
were
so
dirty
it
was
hard
to
see
inside
but
they
were
able
to
distinguish
three
persons
sitting
at
a
living
room
table
papers
were
spread
out
before
them
and
they
were
adding
figures
there
was
no
sign
of
the
sack
which
had
been
carried
into
the
house
who
are
they
penny
asked
her
companion
joe
the
sweeper
ma
harper
and
her
husband
another
woman
is
coming
into
the
room
now
but
she
only
a
stupid
houseworker
ma
hires
by
the
week
sally
moved
backwards
intending
to
give
penny
her
place
at
the
window
inadvertently
she
stepped
on
a
stick
which
broke
in
two
with
a
snap
though
the
sound
was
not
loud
it
apparently
was
heard
by
those
inside
the
house
for
immediately
claude
harper
shoved
back
his
chair
and
started
toward
the
window
what
was
that
the
girls
heard
him
mutter
i
thought
i
heard
someone
outside
quick
crouch
down
or
he
see
us
penny
warned
pulling
sally
to
the
ground
claude
harper
a
man
in
dirty
leather
jacket
appeared
at
the
window
to
the
alarm
of
the
girls
he
thrust
up
the
sash
in
plain
view
should
he
peer
down
over
the
ledge
they
held
their
breath
the
man
however
gazed
toward
the
boat
docks
i
do
see
anyone
he
reported
to
his
companions
i
was
sure
i
heard
something
he
broke
off
ending
sharply
and
i
did
too
what
is
it
claude
his
wife
called
anyone
been
here
this
afternoon
he
demanded
nary
a
soul
until
you
came
take
a
look
at
those
shoetracks
in
the
sand
hearing
the
words
penny
and
sally
gazed
behind
them
from
the
bush
on
the
beach
to
the
wall
where
they
crouched
led
a
telltale
trail
i
go
outside
and
look
around
harper
said
to
his
wife
he
slammed
down
the
window
we
sunk
sally
moaned
we
ca
run
across
the
beach
without
being
seen
and
we
certain
to
be
caught
here
keeping
close
to
the
wall
treading
in
firm
earth
which
left
no
visible
shoemarks
the
girls
crept
around
the
building
corner
the
slamming
of
a
door
warned
them
that
claude
harper
already
was
on
their
trail
someone
been
here
by
the
window
they
heard
him
shout
frantically
the
girls
looked
about
for
a
place
to
hide
there
was
no
shrubbery
nearby
only
the
waterfront
penny
desperate
gaze
fastened
upon
the
rowboat
tied
up
at
the
pier
nearby
in
the
bottom
lay
an
old
canvas
sail
quick
the
boat
she
whispered
to
sally
we
be
caught
there
sure
it
even
more
certain
if
we
stay
here
come
on
it
our
only
chance
choosing
the
lesser
of
two
evils
they
tiptoed
across
the
pier
though
many
of
the
boards
were
rotten
and
loose
their
shoes
fortunately
made
no
sound
scrambling
down
into
the
boat
the
girls
jerked
the
canvas
sail
over
them
barely
had
they
hidden
themselves
than
their
hearts
sank
for
they
heard
heavy
footsteps
approaching
on
the
pier
chapter
the
that
claude
harper
was
searching
for
them
the
girls
did
not
doubt
but
though
he
knew
someone
had
been
peering
in
the
window
they
were
hopeful
he
had
not
actually
seen
them
huddling
beneath
the
sail
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
they
nervously
waited
the
man
came
farther
out
on
the
pier
the
boards
creaking
beneath
his
weight
at
any
instant
the
girls
expected
to
have
the
sailcloth
jerked
from
their
heads
however
harper
attention
was
diverted
as
sweeper
joe
came
out
of
the
house
find
anyone
the
factory
worker
asked
no
but
tracks
lead
to
the
window
someone
been
spying
kids
probably
i
do
know
about
that
claude
harper
returned
gruffly
i
feel
a
lot
safer
if
we
did
have
all
that
stuff
in
the
basement
what
our
chances
of
getting
rid
of
it
tonight
we
ca
do
it
tomorrow
or
next
night
maybe
arrangements
have
got
to
be
made
and
if
we
try
to
push
things
we
end
up
in
a
jam
the
voices
faded
away
though
not
entirely
presently
daring
to
peep
from
beneath
the
canvas
penny
saw
that
the
two
men
had
seated
themselves
on
the
rear
steps
of
the
house
at
the
edge
of
the
river
and
within
plain
view
of
the
boat
we
in
a
nice
position
now
she
whispered
to
sally
suppose
they
sit
there
until
they
decide
to
leave
in
this
boat
we
be
caught
we
the
same
as
trapped
now
unless
they
go
back
into
the
house
the
two
men
showed
no
inclination
to
leave
they
talked
earnestly
together
evidently
making
plans
of
some
sort
though
the
girls
tried
hard
to
overhear
they
could
catch
only
an
occasional
word
after
awhile
ma
harper
a
wiry
ugly
woman
with
stringy
black
hair
came
outdoors
to
join
the
men
on
the
steps
it
getting
late
she
warned
if
you
goin
to
tend
to
that
job
today
you
have
to
be
gettin
across
the
river
ai
you
due
to
show
up
for
work
at
four
joe
that
right
the
man
yawned
getting
up
i
be
glad
when
i
can
chuck
the
whole
business
and
live
without
workin
though
penny
and
sally
did
not
hear
much
of
the
conversation
it
was
evident
to
them
that
the
men
were
about
ready
to
make
use
of
the
boat
we
sunk
sally
whispered
fearfully
maybe
we
ought
to
climb
out
of
here
and
make
a
dash
for
it
penny
offered
a
better
idea
why
not
untie
the
rope
and
let
the
boat
drift
off
she
proposed
the
current
is
swift
and
should
carry
us
downstream
fairly
fast
any
other
boat
around
that
they
can
use
to
follow
us
in
i
do
see
any
penny
raised
the
sail
a
little
higher
as
she
gazed
along
the
pier
and
nearby
beach
all
right
then
do
your
stuff
sally
urged
while
she
held
the
sail
slightly
above
penny
head
so
that
no
movement
would
be
discernible
to
those
on
the
house
steps
the
latter
reached
her
hands
from
beneath
the
cloth
and
swiftly
untied
the
rope
the
boat
began
to
drift
away
covered
by
the
sail
the
girls
lay
motionless
and
flat
on
the
craft
bottom
at
first
nothing
happened
but
as
they
began
to
hope
that
the
men
would
not
notice
the
drifting
boat
they
heard
an
explosive
shout
look
claude
harper
exclaimed
our
boat
jumpin
fish
hooks
sweeper
joe
muttered
how
did
that
happen
i
tied
secure
it
looks
like
it
the
other
retorted
sarcastically
i
ca
afford
to
lose
that
boat
the
girls
could
hear
running
footsteps
on
the
pier
and
boardwalk
near
the
dance
pavilion
sally
dared
to
peep
from
beneath
the
canvas
again
they
after
a
motorboat
she
reported
tensely
harper
has
one
he
keeps
locked
in
a
boathouse
how
close
are
we
to
the
bend
in
the
river
about
twenty
yards
the
swift
current
was
doing
its
best
for
the
girls
swinging
their
boat
toward
the
bend
once
beyond
it
they
would
be
temporarily
hidden
from
the
pier
but
the
current
also
was
tending
to
carry
them
farther
and
farther
from
shore
do
we
dare
row
penny
asked
nervously
not
yet
harper
is
having
trouble
getting
the
engine
of
his
boat
started
sally
reported
we
be
safe
for
a
minute
or
two
getting
closer
to
the
bend
to
the
nervous
girls
the
boat
scarcely
seemed
to
move
then
at
last
it
passed
the
bend
and
they
were
screened
by
willow
trees
and
bushes
now
sally
signalled
in
a
tense
whisper
throwing
off
the
sail
they
seized
oars
and
paddled
with
all
their
strength
quiet
sally
warned
as
penny
oar
made
a
splash
sounds
carry
plainly
over
the
water
the
blast
of
a
motorboat
engine
told
them
that
harper
and
his
companion
had
started
in
pursuit
only
a
minute
or
two
would
be
required
for
them
to
round
the
bend
throwing
caution
to
the
winds
sally
and
penny
dug
in
with
their
oars
shooting
their
craft
toward
shore
the
boat
grated
softly
on
the
sand
instantly
the
girls
leaped
out
splashing
through
water
as
sally
was
about
to
start
across
the
beach
penny
seized
her
hand
we
must
leave
a
trail
of
footprints
this
time
she
warned
treading
a
log
at
the
water
edge
penny
walked
its
length
to
firm
ground
which
took
no
visible
shoe
print
sally
followed
her
to
a
clump
of
bushes
where
they
crouched
and
waited
barely
had
they
taken
cover
when
the
motorboat
came
into
view
heading
for
the
little
cove
there
claude
harper
recaptured
the
runaway
rowboat
tying
it
to
the
stern
of
the
other
craft
suddenly
penny
was
dismayed
as
she
realized
that
in
their
flight
a
most
important
detail
had
been
overlooked
the
oars
she
whispered
they
wet
maybe
the
men
wo
see
sally
said
hopefully
we
left
them
half
covered
by
the
canvas
intent
only
upon
returning
to
the
pier
claude
harper
and
his
companion
failed
to
notice
anything
amiss
apparently
assuming
the
boat
had
been
carelessly
tied
and
had
drifted
away
under
its
own
power
they
were
not
suspicious
that
was
a
narrow
squeak
penny
sighed
in
relief
as
the
motorboat
with
the
other
craft
in
tow
finally
disappeared
around
the
bend
the
oars
will
quickly
dry
in
the
sun
so
i
guess
we
safe
now
that
they
were
well
out
of
trouble
the
adventure
seemed
fun
penny
glanced
at
her
wristwatch
observing
that
it
was
past
four
jack
will
be
waiting
for
me
she
said
to
sally
i
have
to
hurry
we
have
plenty
of
time
sally
returned
carelessly
you
usually
can
count
on
jack
being
half
an
hour
late
for
appointments
walking
swiftly
along
the
deserted
shore
the
girls
discussed
what
they
had
overheard
at
the
harpers
we
stirred
up
a
big
fuss
and
did
learn
too
much
penny
said
regretfully
all
the
same
it
looks
as
if
the
harpers
and
sweeper
joe
are
mixed
up
in
this
brass
business
together
they
spoke
of
having
something
stored
in
the
basement
that
is
what
interests
me
oh
penny
if
only
we
could
go
back
there
sometime
when
the
harpers
are
gone
and
really
investigate
maybe
we
can
sally
shook
her
head
ma
harper
almost
never
goes
away
from
home
but
sometimes
she
has
streams
of
visitors
from
osage
mostly
women
often
wondered
why
factory
girls
no
they
housewives
and
every
type
of
person
i
think
harper
must
be
selling
something
to
them
but
i
never
could
figure
it
out
the
was
at
the
far
side
of
the
river
so
sally
for
lack
of
occupation
walked
on
with
penny
to
the
dock
where
she
was
to
meet
jack
greatly
to
their
surprise
he
was
there
ahead
of
them
and
evidently
had
been
waiting
for
some
length
of
time
seeing
the
girls
he
slowly
arose
to
his
feet
well
jack
what
did
you
learn
at
the
factory
penny
asked
eagerly
why
not
much
of
anything
you
mean
you
were
able
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
man
who
dropped
his
badge
aboard
the
penny
asked
incredulously
of
course
you
learned
the
name
if
you
really
tried
sally
added
every
single
badge
used
at
your
factory
would
be
recorded
thus
trapped
jack
said
lamely
oh
i
learned
his
name
all
right
take
it
easy
and
i
tell
you
chapter
puzzled
by
jack
behavior
and
his
evident
reluctance
to
reveal
what
he
had
learned
penny
and
sally
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
dock
at
their
urging
he
said
well
i
traced
the
number
through
our
employment
office
the
badge
was
issued
to
a
worker
named
adam
glowershick
neither
of
the
girls
ever
had
heard
of
the
name
but
sally
upon
studying
the
picture
again
was
sure
she
recalled
having
seen
him
as
a
passenger
aboard
the
he
a
punch
press
operator
jack
added
and
he
the
man
you
thought
you
knew
penny
asked
curiously
yes
as
i
told
you
i
seen
him
at
the
harpers
jack
acted
ill
at
ease
the
girls
exchanged
a
quick
glance
but
they
did
not
tell
jack
of
their
recent
adventure
well
why
do
we
have
the
fellow
arrested
sally
demanded
after
a
moment
of
silence
i
satisfied
he
stole
the
brass
lantern
he
probably
came
aboard
for
money
and
unable
to
get
into
the
safe
took
the
trophy
for
meanness
or
he
may
be
mixed
up
with
the
gang
of
factory
brass
thieves
penny
supplied
you
ca
prove
a
case
against
a
man
because
he
might
have
dropped
the
badge
anytime
he
happened
to
be
a
passenger
aboard
the
ferry
jack
said
it
would
do
no
good
to
have
him
booked
on
suspicion
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
sally
asked
significantly
of
course
not
jack
is
right
about
it
penny
interposed
hastily
we
need
more
information
before
we
ask
police
to
make
an
arrest
any
other
news
jack
nothing
startling
but
you
know
that
detective
your
father
brought
here
from
riverview
heiney
yes
he
reported
today
that
sweeper
joe
contacted
him
again
offering
to
sell
a
large
quantity
of
brass
an
appointment
has
been
made
for
the
delivery
friday
night
if
it
proves
to
be
stolen
brass
then
he
trapped
himself
can
they
prove
it
the
same
brass
heiney
numbers
and
records
every
piece
he
buys
he
should
be
able
to
establish
a
case
knowing
that
her
father
had
intended
to
keep
the
junkman
activities
a
secret
penny
was
disturbed
by
jack
talking
in
public
evidently
he
had
gleaned
this
latest
information
from
his
father
she
was
even
more
troubled
by
his
attitude
toward
adam
glowershick
presently
saying
goodbye
to
sally
she
and
jack
returned
to
shadow
island
a
strange
boat
was
tied
up
in
the
berth
usually
occupied
by
the
since
the
sailboat
was
nowhere
along
the
dock
it
was
evident
that
gandiss
his
wife
and
parker
had
gone
for
an
outing
on
the
river
we
seem
to
have
a
visitor
penny
remarked
jack
said
nothing
but
intently
studied
the
man
who
slouched
near
the
boathouse
hat
pulled
low
to
shade
his
eyes
from
the
sun
glare
why
is
that
the
same
fellow
whose
picture
was
on
the
factory
badge
penny
exclaimed
adam
glowershick
careful
or
he
hear
you
jack
warned
scowling
i
know
this
man
he
here
to
see
me
penny
gazed
again
at
the
stranger
who
had
dark
bushy
hair
and
prominent
cheekbones
if
that
is
glowershick
it
his
twin
she
thought
and
asked
jack
if
he
had
the
factory
badge
with
him
no
i
have
he
answered
irritably
furthermore
i
wish
you
would
cut
out
such
wild
speculation
he
hear
you
jack
brought
the
boat
in
leaping
ashore
he
asked
penny
to
fasten
the
ropes
i
be
back
in
a
minute
he
flung
at
her
as
he
strode
off
it
took
time
to
make
the
craft
secure
when
penny
glanced
up
from
her
work
jack
and
the
stranger
had
disappeared
behind
the
boathouse
queer
how
fast
jack
ducked
out
of
here
she
thought
more
than
a
little
annoyed
by
the
boy
behavior
penny
started
up
the
gravel
path
to
the
house
midway
there
she
heard
footsteps
and
turning
saw
jack
hastening
after
her
penny
he
began
diffidently
she
waited
for
him
to
go
on
i
hate
to
ask
this
he
said
uncomfortably
but
how
are
you
fixed
for
money
i
have
a
little
dad
gave
me
a
fairly
large
sum
to
spend
when
we
came
here
could
you
let
me
have
twenty
dollars
it
would
only
be
a
loan
for
a
few
days
i
i
would
ask
it
only
i
need
it
badly
dad
only
gave
me
jack
i
pay
you
back
in
just
a
few
days
penny
honest
i
will
i
help
you
out
of
your
jam
penny
agreed
unwillingly
but
something
tells
me
i
should
do
it
your
parents
do
say
anything
to
them
about
it
jack
pleaded
my
father
gives
me
a
good
allowance
and
if
he
knew
i
had
spent
all
of
it
ahead
he
have
a
fit
penny
went
to
her
room
for
the
money
returning
with
four
crisp
five
dollar
bills
she
had
planned
to
buy
a
new
dress
but
now
it
must
wait
thanks
jack
said
gratefully
fairly
snatching
the
money
from
her
hand
oh
yes
another
favor
please
do
mention
to
my
folks
that
anyone
was
here
today
who
is
the
man
jack
oh
just
a
fellow
i
met
the
boy
started
moving
away
penny
however
pursued
him
down
the
path
not
so
fast
jack
since
i
have
a
financial
interest
in
your
affairs
now
it
only
fair
that
i
ask
a
few
questions
did
you
meet
this
man
at
the
harpers
what
if
i
did
now
you
in
debt
to
him
and
he
pressing
you
for
money
you
want
your
parents
to
know
something
like
that
jack
muttered
avoiding
her
steady
gaze
i
do
like
being
a
party
to
anything
i
fail
to
understand
jack
if
you
expect
me
to
keep
quiet
about
this
you
have
to
make
a
promise
what
is
it
that
you
not
go
to
the
harpers
again
okay
i
promise
jack
agreed
promptly
the
truth
is
i
had
enough
of
the
place
now
is
the
lecture
concluded
quite
finished
penny
replied
with
troubled
eyes
she
watched
jack
return
to
the
boathouse
and
hand
her
money
to
the
stranger
maybe
that
fellow
is
glowershick
she
thought
but
he
certainly
looks
like
the
picture
if
jack
should
be
mixed
up
with
those
brass
thieves
penny
deliberately
dismissed
the
idea
from
her
mind
a
guest
of
the
gandiss
family
she
could
not
permit
herself
to
distrust
jack
he
was
inclined
to
be
wild
irresponsible
and
at
times
arrogant
yet
she
had
never
questioned
his
basic
character
even
though
it
disturbed
her
to
know
that
he
had
given
money
to
the
stranger
she
refused
to
believe
that
he
was
dishonest
or
that
he
would
betray
his
father
trust
if
penny
hoped
that
jack
would
offer
a
complete
explanation
for
his
actions
she
was
disappointed
after
the
stranger
had
gone
he
deliberately
avoided
her
and
that
night
at
dinner
he
had
very
little
to
say
when
the
meal
was
finished
jack
roved
restlessly
about
the
house
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
i
hope
you
planning
on
staying
home
tonight
his
mother
commented
lately
you
scarcely
spent
an
evening
here
there
nothing
to
do
on
an
island
jack
complained
i
thought
i
might
run
in
to
town
for
an
hour
or
so
he
met
penny
gaze
and
amended
hastily
on
second
thought
i
guess
i
wo
how
about
an
exciting
game
of
chess
the
evening
was
dull
heightened
only
by
gandiss
discussion
of
the
latest
difficulties
at
the
factory
another
large
quantity
of
brass
had
disappeared
he
revealed
to
parker
perhaps
our
detectives
will
solve
the
mystery
eventually
he
declared
but
i
beginning
to
lose
heart
the
firm
has
lost
already
and
the
thieves
become
bolder
each
day
at
the
start
only
a
small
ring
operated
now
i
am
convinced
at
least
ten
or
fifteen
employes
may
be
in
on
the
scheme
to
defraud
me
the
brass
must
be
smuggled
past
the
gateman
parker
commented
thoughtfully
we
have
three
of
them
gandiss
replied
several
persons
have
been
turned
in
but
nothing
ever
could
be
proved
against
any
individual
who
was
searched
deeply
interested
in
her
father
remark
penny
kept
thinking
about
clark
clayton
the
gateman
and
his
apparent
friendship
with
sweeper
joe
late
the
next
afternoon
when
she
knew
he
would
be
on
duty
she
purposely
arrived
at
the
factory
just
as
a
large
group
of
employes
was
leaving
though
at
his
usual
post
clark
clayton
did
not
appear
especially
alert
as
employes
filed
past
him
he
paid
them
no
special
heed
several
persons
who
carried
bulky
packages
were
not
even
stopped
for
inspection
why
a
person
could
carry
a
ton
of
brass
through
that
gate
and
he
would
know
the
difference
she
thought
making
no
attempt
to
enter
the
grounds
penny
watched
for
a
while
then
she
hailed
a
taxi
cab
and
told
the
driver
to
take
her
to
the
river
they
were
nearing
the
docks
when
the
man
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
said
carelessly
how
would
you
like
to
buy
some
genuine
silk
stockings
how
would
i
like
to
stake
out
a
claim
to
part
of
the
moon
penny
countered
scarcely
knowing
how
to
take
the
question
no
i
serious
the
cab
driver
went
on
slowing
the
taxi
to
idling
pace
i
know
a
woman
along
the
river
who
has
a
pretty
fair
stock
of
genuine
silk
stockings
beauties
black
market
penny
asked
with
disapproval
well
no
i
would
call
it
that
the
man
argued
she
had
a
supply
of
these
stockings
and
wants
to
get
rid
of
them
nothing
wrong
in
that
five
dollars
a
pair
five
dollars
a
pair
penny
echoed
barely
keeping
her
temper
if
i
took
you
there
she
might
let
you
have
them
for
a
dollar
less
penny
opened
her
lips
to
tell
the
black
market
runner
what
she
thought
of
a
person
who
would
engage
in
such
illegal
business
then
she
closed
them
again
and
did
a
little
quick
thinking
after
all
it
might
be
wise
to
learn
where
the
place
was
and
then
report
to
the
police
well
i
do
know
she
said
pretending
to
hesitate
i
like
to
have
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
but
i
have
much
money
with
me
where
is
the
place
not
far
from
here
along
the
river
i
drive
you
there
and
if
you
make
a
purchase
you
need
pay
me
any
fare
all
right
that
fair
enough
let
go
penny
agreed
as
they
rattled
along
the
street
she
carefully
memorized
the
number
and
took
mental
notes
on
the
driver
appearance
intending
to
report
him
to
police
no
doubt
he
received
a
generous
commission
for
bringing
customers
to
the
establishment
she
reasoned
the
cab
had
not
gone
far
when
it
began
to
slacken
pace
peering
out
penny
was
astonished
to
see
that
they
were
stopping
in
front
of
the
harper
house
overlooking
the
river
is
this
the
place
she
gasped
as
the
driver
swung
open
the
door
i
i
do
believe
i
want
to
go
in
after
all
i
thought
you
were
taking
me
to
a
shop
you
ca
get
silk
stockings
anywhere
else
in
the
county
the
driver
said
not
like
the
kind
ma
harper
sells
just
go
on
in
and
tell
her
i
brought
you
she
treat
you
right
taking
penny
by
the
elbow
he
half
pulled
her
from
the
cab
and
started
her
toward
the
shabby
unpainted
dwelling
chapter
while
the
cab
driver
waited
penny
crossed
the
sagging
porch
and
rapped
on
the
door
evidently
the
taxi
approach
had
been
noted
for
almost
at
once
ma
harper
appeared
she
was
a
tall
thin
woman
sallow
of
face
and
with
a
hard
glint
to
her
eyes
penny
was
not
in
the
least
deceived
by
the
smile
that
was
bestowed
upon
her
hello
deary
the
woman
greeted
her
stepping
aside
for
her
to
enter
did
ernst
bring
you
to
buy
something
he
spoke
of
silk
stockings
penny
returned
cautiously
i
not
sure
that
i
care
to
purchase
them
oh
you
will
when
you
see
them
deary
ma
harper
declared
in
a
chirpy
tone
just
come
in
and
i
show
them
to
you
are
genuine
silk
stockings
hard
to
get
now
i
do
know
of
any
place
they
can
be
bought
except
here
i
was
lucky
to
lay
in
a
good
supply
before
the
start
of
the
war
only
one
or
two
pairs
are
left
now
but
i
let
you
have
them
deary
that
very
kind
of
you
returned
penny
with
dry
humor
the
stockings
cost
me
plenty
went
on
the
woman
motioning
for
the
girl
to
seat
herself
on
a
sagging
davenport
i
have
to
ask
five
dollars
a
pair
she
eyed
penny
speculatively
to
note
how
the
figure
struck
her
penny
had
no
intention
of
making
a
purchase
at
any
price
but
to
keep
the
conversation
rolling
she
pretended
to
be
interested
five
dollars
ai
much
when
you
consider
you
ca
get
stockings
like
these
anywhere
else
the
woman
added
just
wait
here
deary
and
bring
out
she
went
quickly
from
the
room
left
alone
penny
gazed
with
curiosity
at
the
crude
furnishings
curtains
hung
at
the
windows
but
they
had
not
been
washed
in
many
months
the
rug
also
was
soiled
and
threadbare
the
main
piece
of
furniture
a
table
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
double
doors
opened
out
upon
a
balcony
above
the
river
wandering
outside
penny
could
see
the
plying
its
way
far
downstream
closer
by
a
small
boat
with
an
outboard
approached
due
to
the
glare
of
a
late
afternoon
sun
on
the
water
she
could
not
at
first
distinguish
its
two
occupants
the
boat
however
looked
familiar
that
the
same
boat
sally
and
i
escaped
in
yesterday
she
thought
and
it
coming
here
nearer
and
nearer
the
craft
approached
until
penny
could
see
the
faces
plainly
one
was
sweeper
joe
and
the
other
clark
clayton
gateman
at
the
gandiss
factory
if
they
see
me
here
they
certain
to
be
suspicious
penny
thought
in
panic
they
remember
having
seen
me
with
gandiss
at
the
factory
i
skip
while
the
skipping
is
good
she
turned
to
find
ma
harper
standing
in
the
doorway
anything
wrong
deary
the
woman
asked
in
a
soft
purr
why
no
penny
stammered
i
i
was
just
admiring
the
river
view
you
were
lookin
at
that
boat
so
i
thought
maybe
you
knew
the
men
sure
there
ai
nothing
wrong
of
course
not
penny
was
growing
decidedly
uncomfortable
she
tried
to
slip
through
the
doorway
but
ma
harper
did
not
move
aside
it
getting
late
penny
said
glancing
at
her
wrist
watch
perhaps
i
should
come
some
other
time
to
look
at
the
stockings
shall
we
say
tomorrow
i
have
the
hosiery
right
here
deary
beauties
ai
they
ma
harper
spread
one
of
the
filmy
stockings
over
her
rough
callous
hand
the
silk
was
fine
and
beautiful
unquestionably
and
of
black
market
origin
yes
they
are
lovely
penny
said
nervously
but
the
truth
is
i
have
five
dollars
with
me
i
have
to
come
back
later
ma
harper
dark
eyes
snapped
angrily
then
what
you
been
takin
my
time
for
she
demanded
say
she
accused
with
sudden
suspicion
her
gaze
roving
to
the
boat
which
now
was
close
to
the
pier
you
seem
in
a
mighty
big
hurry
to
get
away
from
here
all
at
once
why
no
it
just
that
the
taxi
man
is
waiting
and
it
getting
late
what
your
name
anyhow
penny
parker
where
do
you
live
i
am
a
summer
vacationist
the
answers
only
partially
satisfied
ma
harper
evidently
she
was
afraid
that
penny
might
be
an
investigator
for
she
debated
a
moment
then
she
said
you
wait
here
until
i
talk
to
someone
but
i
really
must
be
leaving
you
wait
here
i
said
ma
harper
snapped
maybe
you
okay
but
i
ai
takin
no
chances
on
you
getting
me
into
trouble
about
these
stockings
wait
until
i
talk
to
joe
leaving
penny
on
the
balcony
she
went
out
by
way
of
the
front
living
room
door
after
it
had
closed
there
was
a
sharp
little
click
which
made
the
girl
fear
she
had
been
locked
in
the
truth
was
quickly
ascertained
the
door
was
locked
for
an
instant
penny
was
frightened
but
she
told
herself
she
was
not
really
a
prisoner
there
were
windows
she
could
unfasten
and
another
door
at
the
rear
of
the
house
intending
to
test
it
she
went
quickly
through
the
kitchen
voices
reached
her
ears
evidently
ma
harper
and
the
two
men
were
standing
close
to
the
door
and
although
speaking
in
low
tones
she
could
hear
most
of
the
conversation
the
girl
may
be
all
right
but
i
think
she
was
sent
here
to
spy
ma
reported
if
we
let
her
go
she
may
bring
the
police
down
on
us
and
if
you
try
to
hold
her
here
you
soon
be
in
trouble
one
of
the
men
answered
penny
thought
the
voice
was
that
of
clark
clayton
you
and
this
petty
stocking
business
of
yours
we
warned
you
to
lay
off
it
sure
blame
me
ma
voice
rose
angrily
the
truth
is
you
getting
scared
of
your
own
racket
i
was
sellin
stockings
and
makin
a
good
safe
income
until
you
come
along
and
talked
my
husband
into
lettin
you
store
your
loot
in
our
basement
well
i
made
up
my
mind
gettin
the
stuff
out
of
here
tonight
and
you
not
bringing
any
more
in
okay
okay
growled
sweeper
joe
just
take
it
easy
and
quit
your
yippin
we
move
the
stuff
as
soon
as
it
gets
dark
fact
is
made
a
deal
with
a
guy
that
runs
a
junk
shop
near
the
factory
offered
us
a
good
price
we
had
to
play
along
slow
and
easy
to
be
sure
he
was
tied
up
with
the
cops
what
about
the
girl
ma
demanded
if
i
let
her
go
she
apt
to
get
me
into
hot
water
about
those
stockings
that
your
funeral
joe
the
sweeper
retorted
if
you
handled
her
right
she
would
have
become
suspicious
the
discussion
went
on
in
lower
tones
then
penny
heard
ma
say
okay
that
the
way
we
do
it
i
think
up
some
story
to
convince
the
girl
but
that
brass
must
be
out
of
here
tonight
another
thing
you
ca
sell
the
lantern
that
simpleton
adam
glowershick
stole
from
the
why
not
sweeper
joe
demanded
there
good
brass
in
it
you
stupid
lout
ma
exclaimed
losing
patience
that
lantern
is
known
to
practically
every
person
along
the
waterfront
let
it
show
up
in
a
pawnshop
or
second
hand
store
and
the
police
would
trace
it
straight
to
us
you
have
to
heave
it
into
the
river
okay
maybe
you
right
the
factory
worker
admitted
penny
had
learned
enough
to
feel
certain
that
brass
stolen
piecemeal
from
the
gandiss
factory
had
been
stored
in
the
harper
basement
even
more
astonishing
was
the
information
that
the
trophy
taken
from
the
also
was
somewhere
in
the
house
if
the
lantern
is
thrown
into
the
river
no
one
ever
be
able
to
recover
it
she
thought
if
only
i
could
get
it
now
and
sneak
away
through
a
window
penny
pulse
stepped
up
a
pace
for
she
knew
that
to
venture
into
the
basement
was
foolhardy
she
listened
again
at
the
door
ma
and
the
men
still
were
talking
but
how
long
they
would
continue
to
do
so
she
could
not
guess
i
risk
it
she
decided
the
basement
door
opened
from
an
inside
wall
of
the
kitchen
penny
groped
her
way
down
the
steep
dark
stairs
but
could
find
no
light
switch
the
cellar
room
was
damp
and
dirty
as
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
which
filtered
in
through
two
small
windows
she
saw
a
furnace
surrounded
by
buckets
of
ashes
and
boxes
of
papers
and
trash
a
clothes
line
was
hung
with
stockings
and
silk
underwear
penny
poked
into
several
of
the
boxes
and
barrels
all
were
empty
then
her
gaze
focused
upon
another
door
which
apparently
led
into
a
fruit
or
storage
room
it
was
padlocked
the
brass
is
locked
in
there
she
thought
her
heart
sinking
the
lantern
too
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
expect
it
without
tools
penny
could
not
hope
to
break
into
the
locked
room
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
she
must
get
away
from
the
house
and
bring
the
police
starting
up
the
stairs
she
stopped
short
an
outside
door
had
slammed
in
the
room
above
she
heard
footsteps
but
no
voices
frightened
penny
remained
motionless
on
the
basement
stairs
she
could
hear
ma
harper
tramping
about
evidently
in
search
of
her
for
the
woman
muttered
angrily
to
herself
i
do
dare
stay
here
the
girl
thought
i
have
to
make
a
dash
for
it
penny
reasoned
that
in
reentering
the
house
ma
harper
probably
had
left
the
front
door
unlocked
what
had
become
of
the
two
men
she
did
not
know
but
she
would
have
to
take
a
chance
on
their
whereabouts
noiselessly
she
crept
up
the
stairs
to
the
kitchen
door
opening
it
a
tiny
crack
though
she
could
not
see
ma
footsteps
told
her
that
the
woman
had
stepped
out
onto
the
balcony
overlooking
the
river
this
will
be
as
good
a
chance
as
i
may
get
she
reasoned
the
door
squeaked
as
she
opened
it
wide
enough
to
slip
through
unnerved
by
the
sound
penny
moved
swiftly
across
the
kitchen
to
the
living
room
so
there
you
are
cried
ma
harper
from
the
balcony
penny
threw
caution
to
the
winds
darting
across
the
room
she
jerked
at
the
outside
door
it
opened
but
on
the
porch
facing
her
stood
sweeper
joe
and
clark
clayton
chapter
the
penny
first
thought
was
to
try
to
dart
past
the
men
but
she
realized
that
to
do
so
would
be
impossible
warned
by
ma
excited
cries
they
had
moved
into
position
to
completely
block
her
path
stop
that
girl
shouted
ma
harper
bearing
down
upon
her
from
the
direction
of
the
river
balcony
she
from
the
police
and
sent
here
to
get
evidence
whirling
around
penny
ran
back
toward
the
kitchen
with
the
woman
in
pursuit
she
did
not
waste
time
testing
the
rear
door
for
she
already
knew
it
to
be
locked
however
opening
from
the
kitchen
was
another
closed
door
which
appeared
to
give
exit
with
no
time
to
debate
penny
jerked
it
open
and
darted
inside
instantly
she
saw
that
she
had
made
a
serious
mistake
she
had
entered
a
small
washroom
and
had
trapped
herself
and
ma
harper
was
practically
upon
her
penny
did
the
only
possible
thing
she
slammed
the
door
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
for
a
moment
at
least
she
was
beyond
reach
i
really
trapped
myself
now
she
thought
recapturing
her
breath
what
a
mess
if
i
had
used
my
head
this
would
have
happened
penny
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bathtub
to
think
already
ma
harper
was
pounding
and
thumping
on
the
flimsy
wooden
door
panel
the
door
rattled
on
its
hinges
you
open
up
or
i
break
down
the
door
the
woman
shouted
furiously
you
hear
me
penny
did
not
answer
there
was
no
escape
from
the
washroom
for
it
had
no
window
the
tub
upon
which
she
sat
was
ringed
with
dirt
evidently
having
seen
no
use
in
many
weeks
above
her
head
stretched
a
short
clothesline
upon
which
hung
a
row
of
ma
harper
stockings
you
let
me
in
ma
harper
shouted
again
if
i
ever
lay
hands
on
you
you
pay
for
this
the
threat
left
penny
entirely
unmoved
she
had
no
intention
of
opening
the
door
no
matter
what
the
woman
might
say
or
do
realizing
that
her
tactics
were
gaining
nothing
ma
tried
another
approach
please
let
me
in
she
coaxed
in
a
falsely
sweet
voice
we
wo
hurt
you
if
you
come
out
now
we
let
you
go
home
just
as
you
want
to
do
penny
was
not
to
be
so
easily
taken
in
she
remained
silent
ma
harper
lost
her
temper
completely
then
she
kicked
at
the
door
and
shouted
for
the
two
men
joe
clark
come
and
help
me
get
this
brat
out
of
here
penny
certain
that
her
moments
of
freedom
were
limited
heard
the
two
men
approach
a
heavy
body
heaved
itself
against
the
door
but
still
the
lock
held
i
do
want
my
door
smashed
she
heard
ma
harper
whine
ca
you
get
a
screwdriver
and
take
off
the
hinges
there
ai
no
other
key
in
the
house
the
reply
of
the
men
was
inaudible
but
penny
heard
their
retreating
footsteps
the
door
knob
kept
rattling
so
she
decided
ma
harper
had
been
left
there
to
keep
watch
this
probably
is
my
only
chance
to
escape
penny
reasoned
i
might
unlock
the
door
and
take
a
chance
on
overpowering
ma
harper
but
she
a
strong
woman
her
roving
gaze
fastened
upon
the
line
of
drying
stockings
and
suddenly
she
had
an
idea
jerking
one
of
the
stockings
down
she
seized
a
thick
bar
of
soap
from
the
dish
above
the
bathtub
and
crammed
it
deep
into
the
toe
of
the
stocking
this
will
make
a
superb
weapon
she
thought
gleefully
almost
as
good
as
a
blackjack
taking
a
firm
grip
on
the
stocking
penny
swung
it
several
times
to
be
certain
of
its
possibilities
then
she
was
ready
quickly
she
unlocked
the
door
and
stepped
back
for
a
moment
nothing
happened
then
ma
harper
pushed
it
open
just
as
she
had
expected
now
i
get
you
she
screamed
springing
at
penny
penny
kept
the
stocking
behind
her
back
i
hate
to
do
this
she
thought
but
she
asking
for
it
as
ma
reached
out
to
seize
her
she
swung
the
stocking
the
encased
cake
of
soap
cut
a
neat
arc
through
the
air
and
clipped
the
woman
sharply
on
the
head
more
startled
than
hurt
she
stumbled
backwards
and
collapsed
into
the
bathtub
pausing
only
long
enough
to
see
that
ma
was
not
really
injured
penny
made
a
dash
for
safety
but
her
escape
was
cut
off
sweeper
joe
and
clayton
the
gateman
were
just
entering
the
front
door
of
the
living
room
armed
with
tools
to
use
in
taking
down
the
washroom
door
seeing
penny
they
again
blocked
the
exit
desperate
she
ran
in
the
only
possible
direction
to
the
balcony
overlooking
the
river
the
docks
were
directly
beneath
the
house
and
waves
lapped
the
posts
of
the
porch
it
was
at
least
a
drop
and
the
water
was
shallow
but
penny
had
no
time
to
calculate
the
risk
leaping
to
the
railing
of
the
balcony
she
poised
there
an
instant
staring
down
at
the
rocks
plainly
visible
in
the
still
water
then
as
sweeper
joe
reached
out
to
grasp
her
by
the
shoulder
she
jumped
she
struck
the
water
head
foremost
in
a
shallow
dive
which
wrenched
her
back
but
kept
her
from
striking
the
river
bottom
brushing
wet
hair
from
her
eyes
she
began
to
stroke
her
shoes
were
heavy
as
lead
and
impeded
her
the
force
of
penny
dive
had
carried
her
many
feet
from
shore
into
deep
water
and
the
river
current
swept
her
farther
away
from
the
docks
weighted
down
by
the
shoes
she
knew
she
did
not
have
sufficient
strength
to
swim
to
shore
with
them
on
burying
her
face
in
the
water
she
doubled
up
and
groping
down
untied
them
one
at
a
time
those
were
good
shoes
she
thought
with
regret
as
she
kicked
them
off
and
saw
them
settle
into
the
river
penny
struck
out
with
smooth
crawl
strokes
for
the
nearby
pier
her
skirt
kept
wrapping
itself
about
her
legs
unwilling
to
discard
it
she
tucked
it
high
about
her
waist
which
made
swimming
much
easier
reaching
the
pier
she
was
pulling
herself
out
onto
it
when
ma
harper
and
the
two
men
came
running
out
of
the
house
to
intercept
her
oh
oh
thought
penny
it
not
going
to
be
as
easy
as
i
assumed
joe
ran
out
on
the
pier
while
ma
and
the
other
man
separated
one
starting
upstream
and
the
other
down
no
matter
which
way
she
turned
penny
saw
that
her
escape
would
be
cut
off
the
river
was
wide
the
current
swift
although
an
excellent
swimmer
she
had
no
desire
to
attempt
such
a
contest
of
endurance
but
there
seemed
no
other
way
deliberately
pushing
off
from
the
pier
she
swam
directly
away
from
shore
after
a
dozen
strokes
she
rolled
over
on
her
back
for
a
moment
to
see
what
was
happening
ma
harper
had
shouted
to
joe
and
the
words
carried
plainly
over
the
water
take
after
her
in
the
boat
we
do
dare
let
her
get
away
now
she
knows
too
much
penny
had
forgotten
the
motorboat
tied
up
at
the
pier
now
as
she
saw
joe
and
clark
clayton
run
toward
it
her
heart
sank
though
the
race
seemed
hopeless
she
flopped
over
onto
her
face
again
and
swam
with
all
her
strength
going
with
the
current
her
feet
churned
the
water
behind
her
several
times
the
men
tried
without
success
to
start
the
motorboat
engine
penny
grew
hopeful
then
she
heard
the
blast
as
the
motor
caught
and
knew
that
in
just
a
minute
the
men
would
overtake
her
frantically
she
glanced
about
for
help
already
late
afternoon
there
were
no
fishing
boats
on
the
river
save
for
ma
harper
who
stood
ready
to
seize
her
should
she
try
to
swim
in
to
the
beach
no
other
persons
were
visible
on
either
shore
the
apparently
was
at
the
far
end
of
her
run
hidden
beyond
the
bend
a
hundred
yards
away
in
shallow
water
lay
a
large
patch
of
tall
river
grass
and
seeing
it
penny
took
new
hope
the
area
was
large
enough
to
offer
a
temporary
refuge
if
she
could
reach
it
not
only
would
the
dense
mat
of
high
grass
protect
her
from
view
but
a
boat
would
not
be
able
to
follow
starting
to
swim
again
she
put
everything
she
had
into
each
stroke
it
would
be
pinch
and
go
to
reach
the
grass
patch
aware
of
her
intention
sweeper
joe
and
clark
clayton
had
changed
course
hoping
to
intercept
her
chapter
the
high
water
grass
loomed
up
and
penny
feet
struck
a
muddy
bottom
with
the
boat
almost
upon
her
she
plunged
into
the
morass
the
water
came
to
armpit
level
pushing
aside
the
thick
stalks
which
wrapped
themselves
about
her
arms
and
body
she
waded
far
into
the
patch
before
she
paused
hidden
by
the
dense
growth
she
could
not
at
first
see
the
pursuing
boat
she
knew
however
that
it
had
halted
at
the
edge
of
the
patch
for
the
motor
had
been
cut
off
and
after
awhile
she
heard
voices
low
spoken
but
nevertheless
clear
for
the
slightest
sound
carried
over
water
she
over
there
somewhere
in
the
center
of
the
patch
one
of
the
men
muttered
i
could
tell
where
she
went
by
the
way
the
grass
moved
shall
we
let
her
go
no
we
got
to
get
her
or
she
tell
everything
she
knows
to
old
man
gandiss
and
the
police
the
other
answered
with
the
motor
shut
off
the
two
men
then
took
out
paddles
and
began
to
force
the
boat
through
the
jungle
of
grass
observing
that
they
were
coming
straight
toward
her
penny
noiselessly
waded
on
taking
every
precaution
not
to
move
the
stalks
unnecessarily
noting
the
direction
of
the
wind
she
went
with
it
hoping
that
any
movement
of
the
grass
would
appear
to
be
caused
by
the
stiff
breeze
but
she
hoped
in
vain
for
suddenly
joe
the
sweeper
shouted
hoarsely
there
she
is
over
there
he
pointed
with
his
paddle
blade
the
men
pushed
the
boat
on
smashing
the
grass
ahead
of
them
in
despair
penny
saw
that
wherever
she
went
she
was
leaving
a
trail
of
trampled
broken
grass
behind
her
no
longer
trying
to
prevent
splashes
she
waded
in
a
wide
then
quickly
she
this
time
making
not
a
sound
slipping
into
the
dense
growth
just
beside
the
trail
she
had
made
she
breathlessly
waited
the
boat
came
into
view
taking
a
deep
breath
penny
ducked
under
water
opening
her
eyes
she
could
see
the
blurred
dark
bottom
of
the
craft
moving
slowly
toward
her
so
close
she
could
have
reached
out
and
touched
it
her
breath
began
to
grow
short
the
boat
barely
seemed
to
move
lungs
felt
as
if
they
were
ready
to
burst
but
still
she
remained
under
water
then
the
men
had
passed
and
she
dared
raise
her
head
for
an
instant
to
gulp
in
air
the
boat
reached
the
end
of
the
trail
through
the
grass
that
penny
herself
had
made
there
it
halted
as
sweeper
joe
and
his
companion
realizing
they
had
lost
their
quarry
debated
their
next
move
she
was
here
a
minute
ago
sweeper
joe
growled
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
clothes
and
saw
the
grass
move
where
did
she
go
she
must
have
doubled
back
with
difficulty
the
men
turned
the
boat
around
and
rowed
toward
penny
again
when
she
dared
wait
no
longer
she
submerged
again
they
passed
her
and
she
came
up
for
air
a
water
snake
slithered
through
the
grass
almost
touching
her
hand
startled
penny
leaped
backwards
making
an
ugly
loud
splash
in
the
water
slight
as
was
the
sound
it
told
the
men
where
she
hid
turning
in
the
boat
they
saw
her
through
the
grass
and
bore
toward
her
again
by
this
time
penny
actually
enjoyed
the
desperate
game
of
hide
and
seek
for
so
far
the
advantage
had
been
hers
she
stood
watching
the
boat
until
it
came
very
close
then
she
dived
coming
up
directly
underneath
the
craft
getting
her
shoulder
squarely
under
one
side
she
raised
up
and
with
an
ease
that
surprised
her
upset
the
boat
the
two
men
went
sprawling
into
the
water
unable
to
swim
they
made
animal
noises
and
clutched
desperately
at
the
grass
for
support
but
as
their
feet
found
solid
footing
they
started
furiously
toward
penny
taking
her
time
and
deliberately
seeking
deeper
water
she
waded
away
that
will
hold
them
for
a
few
minutes
she
thought
gleefully
i
get
out
of
this
jungle
now
and
swim
ashore
one
more
the
girl
hopes
were
rudely
dashed
as
she
reached
the
edge
of
the
grass
area
she
was
disconcerted
to
see
another
rowboat
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
harper
place
with
shadows
deepening
on
the
water
she
could
not
at
first
distinguish
the
man
then
she
recognized
claude
harper
he
must
have
come
home
and
ma
sent
him
here
to
help
capture
me
she
thought
if
i
swim
out
now
i
certainly
be
caught
crouching
down
so
that
her
nose
was
just
above
the
water
she
waited
claude
harper
rowed
on
resting
upon
his
oars
when
perhaps
ten
yards
away
joe
he
called
there
was
an
answering
shout
from
the
center
of
the
grass
patch
that
gal
somewhere
close
by
sweeper
joe
shouted
in
warning
she
upset
our
boat
stay
where
you
are
and
see
that
she
does
slip
past
you
thus
warned
claude
harper
began
to
survey
the
grass
patch
intently
he
looked
hard
at
the
place
where
penny
stood
she
was
certain
he
had
seen
her
but
after
a
moment
he
turned
slightly
and
his
eyes
roved
on
as
she
hesitated
not
knowing
what
to
do
sweeper
joe
and
clark
clayton
who
had
bailed
out
their
boat
came
paddling
out
to
meet
harper
wet
and
plastered
with
mud
they
had
lost
one
of
the
paddles
if
you
ai
sights
harper
cackled
upon
seeing
them
he
slapped
his
thigh
in
glee
you
look
like
a
couple
o
stupid
mud
turtles
fool
rasped
sweeper
joe
do
you
have
sense
enough
to
figure
what
will
happen
if
that
girl
gets
away
from
us
you
ai
goin
back
to
no
job
at
the
gandiss
factory
nor
clayton
neither
it
a
lot
more
serious
than
that
joe
snapped
he
guided
the
boat
alongside
harper
craft
why
do
you
think
i
took
that
job
in
the
first
place
and
spent
better
than
two
years
studyin
the
gandiss
factory
layout
i
lined
up
the
employes
we
could
get
to
go
along
with
us
got
everything
organized
and
now
this
gal
has
to
bust
up
the
show
just
as
the
profits
begin
to
roll
in
better
pipe
down
harper
warned
curtly
she
can
hear
you
and
so
can
everyone
else
on
the
river
what
the
difference
joe
argued
in
disgust
we
through
gettin
out
of
this
town
tonight
me
with
you
added
clark
clayton
ever
since
gandiss
put
detectives
on
the
job
i
figured
the
game
was
gettin
too
dangerous
now
it
was
claude
harper
who
lost
his
temper
hold
on
he
said
warningly
it
all
right
for
you
guys
to
blow
town
but
what
about
me
and
the
wife
you
can
do
what
you
please
joe
retorted
we
got
your
brass
cached
in
our
basement
if
the
cops
should
find
it
there
we
take
the
rap
get
rid
of
it
that
a
lot
easier
said
than
done
besides
that
brass
is
worth
a
tidy
sum
o
money
then
why
not
sell
it
tonight
joe
proposed
suddenly
if
we
can
get
it
to
the
junkman
who
has
a
place
across
from
the
factory
he
pay
us
a
good
price
we
can
complete
the
deal
and
still
get
out
of
town
before
midnight
that
okay
for
you
harper
argued
but
ma
and
i
own
property
here
and
we
got
a
good
business
it
was
your
stupid
wife
stocking
business
that
got
us
into
this
jam
clark
clayton
snarled
i
ai
talkin
about
that
i
mean
our
dance
hall
we
clean
up
about
a
hundred
bucks
every
saturday
night
you
should
have
thought
about
that
before
you
went
in
with
us
joe
retorted
you
knew
the
risks
you
were
taking
anyway
this
mess
was
your
wife
making
a
silence
fell
and
then
clark
clayton
said
we
ai
gettin
nowhere
we
got
to
decide
what
we
goin
to
do
and
we
got
to
make
sure
that
gal
do
get
out
o
this
weed
patch
until
we
arranged
our
escape
in
whispers
the
men
conferred
though
penny
strained
her
ears
she
could
not
catch
a
single
word
however
a
plan
satisfactory
to
the
three
seemed
to
have
been
formulated
for
presently
the
two
boats
separated
sweeper
joe
and
clark
clayton
paddled
off
heading
for
the
pier
at
the
harpers
the
other
man
remained
in
his
rowboat
unquestionably
detailed
to
keep
watch
of
the
grass
patch
and
prevent
the
girl
escape
to
amuse
himself
he
began
to
call
out
to
her
though
he
could
not
see
her
or
know
where
she
was
you
think
you
a
clever
one
he
taunted
but
you
jest
wait
get
you
out
o
there
and
when
we
do
you
ai
goin
to
like
it
lest
a
movement
of
the
grass
or
a
splash
betray
her
penny
remained
perfectly
still
shadows
deepened
on
the
river
for
night
was
fast
coming
on
her
muscles
became
stiff
and
cramped
the
wind
chilled
her
to
the
very
bone
and
the
water
which
at
first
had
not
seemed
unbearably
cold
made
her
teeth
chatter
and
dance
each
minute
became
an
hour
as
the
torture
increased
i
have
to
do
something
she
thought
desperately
i
ca
endure
this
much
longer
chapter
desperate
in
the
rowboat
claude
harper
slowly
patrolled
the
area
keeping
an
alert
watch
for
the
slightest
movement
amid
the
grass
once
as
a
crane
arose
from
the
dense
growth
into
the
darkening
sky
he
focused
a
flashlight
beam
on
the
spot
he
prepared
to
stay
here
half
the
night
if
necessary
penny
thought
shivering
she
could
think
of
no
means
of
escape
when
it
became
completely
dark
she
might
be
able
to
swim
away
without
being
detected
but
long
exposure
in
cold
water
had
weakened
her
and
she
was
none
too
certain
of
her
ability
to
reach
shore
her
absence
at
the
island
surely
must
have
been
noticed
by
this
time
she
reasoned
why
was
not
a
boat
sent
in
search
of
her
i
hope
they
do
assume
i
am
staying
with
sally
for
the
night
she
worried
penny
thoughts
were
momentarily
distracted
as
she
heard
indistinct
voices
from
the
direction
of
the
harper
dock
lights
had
been
turned
on
in
the
house
and
basement
those
men
are
getting
rid
of
the
stolen
brass
she
reasoned
if
they
try
to
sell
it
to
heiney
they
still
may
be
caught
presently
the
motorboat
moved
away
from
the
harper
dock
its
engine
laboring
the
craft
was
sunk
low
in
the
water
as
if
from
a
heavy
load
the
boat
did
not
turn
down
stream
as
penny
expected
instead
it
crossed
the
river
at
right
angles
stopping
in
at
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
there
the
engine
was
cut
off
now
what
thought
penny
claude
harper
likewise
seemed
puzzled
by
the
action
for
he
turned
to
stare
muttering
to
himself
though
penny
could
not
see
what
the
men
were
doing
aboard
the
boat
she
heard
a
loud
splash
as
something
heavy
was
dropped
overboard
the
fools
claude
harper
exclaimed
the
fools
another
splash
and
still
another
followed
then
the
boat
turned
and
came
toward
the
grass
patch
claude
harper
hailed
the
men
with
an
angry
exclamation
you
idiots
after
all
the
risk
we
taken
you
dump
our
profits
in
the
river
keep
your
shirt
on
sweeper
joe
retorted
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
glowershick
just
phoned
from
town
what
he
have
to
report
nothing
good
you
know
that
junk
shop
where
we
arranged
to
sell
our
stuff
where
the
owner
offered
us
a
higher
price
than
any
other
place
in
town
well
he
was
a
dick
planted
there
by
old
man
gandiss
himself
they
already
got
wind
of
who
in
on
the
deal
then
if
we
try
to
sell
the
brass
anywhere
else
we
be
pinched
you
catching
on
harper
have
you
dumped
all
the
stuff
in
the
river
it
will
take
two
more
trips
at
least
and
there
the
brass
lantern
to
get
rid
of
joe
added
as
soon
as
the
job
is
done
clark
and
me
are
gettin
out
of
the
city
what
are
ma
and
me
gon
na
do
harper
whined
we
got
property
here
that
up
to
you
joe
snapped
if
it
was
for
the
gal
you
be
safe
enough
seen
anything
of
her
nary
a
sign
she
may
have
slipped
away
under
water
the
gal
swims
like
an
eel
i
do
think
she
got
away
i
been
watchin
like
a
hawk
she
sure
to
spill
everything
and
she
seen
plenty
joe
muttered
even
though
the
cops
do
find
any
evidence
they
could
make
it
plenty
tough
for
you
and
the
missus
we
got
to
leave
town
harper
admitted
after
takin
all
this
risk
and
bein
all
set
to
cash
in
big
it
a
dirty
break
it
ai
fair
squawkin
wo
do
no
good
joe
said
shortly
the
question
is
what
are
we
goin
to
do
about
the
gal
we
got
to
make
sure
she
wo
carry
no
tales
until
we
safely
out
of
town
then
we
have
to
flush
her
out
of
this
bird
nest
joe
decided
there
a
way
we
can
do
it
the
manner
in
which
she
was
to
be
caught
soon
became
apparent
to
penny
systematically
the
men
began
to
flatten
all
of
the
grass
with
their
paddles
and
oars
foot
by
foot
she
retreated
their
strategy
was
discouragingly
clear
the
flattened
grass
no
longer
offered
protection
soon
it
all
would
be
level
with
the
water
and
she
would
have
no
screen
so
cold
that
her
limbs
were
nearly
paralyzed
penny
considered
giving
herself
up
in
any
case
the
outcome
would
be
the
same
the
only
other
recourse
was
to
scream
for
help
and
hope
that
someone
along
the
shore
would
hear
her
and
investigate
with
only
the
harper
house
close
by
the
prospect
that
anyone
would
come
to
her
aid
was
practically
nil
angered
at
not
finding
the
girl
harper
and
his
companions
swung
their
paddles
viciously
penny
retreated
further
still
reluctant
to
abandon
freedom
then
far
downstream
she
saw
the
recognizing
it
by
the
pattern
its
lights
made
above
the
water
the
ferry
had
finished
its
passenger
run
and
now
apparently
was
coming
upstream
to
anchor
for
the
night
as
penny
watched
the
boat
she
took
new
hope
if
only
she
could
signal
captain
barker
or
sally
unless
the
ferry
changed
course
it
was
almost
certain
to
pass
the
grass
patch
however
with
the
water
shallow
there
it
would
give
the
area
a
wide
berth
even
if
i
shouted
for
help
no
one
aboard
would
hear
me
she
reasoned
but
i
have
to
try
something
i
finished
if
i
stay
here
straight
up
the
river
came
the
penny
could
see
a
man
in
the
lighted
pilot
house
but
no
one
was
visible
on
the
decks
the
ferry
was
traveling
at
a
rapid
speed
penny
decided
to
wait
no
longer
creeping
to
the
very
edge
of
the
grass
she
ducked
under
water
and
started
to
swim
her
strength
had
gone
even
more
than
she
realized
arms
and
legs
were
so
stiff
they
barely
could
press
against
the
water
as
she
stroked
a
few
feet
and
she
was
forced
to
come
to
the
surface
there
she
is
shouted
sweeper
joe
bringing
the
boat
around
he
started
directly
for
her
penny
swam
with
all
the
power
at
her
command
stroking
deep
and
fast
not
daring
to
look
back
she
could
hear
the
dip
of
sweeper
joe
oars
straight
toward
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
she
propelled
herself
her
crawl
strokes
were
jerky
but
they
carried
her
along
and
she
had
calculated
well
aided
by
the
current
she
would
intercept
the
path
of
the
oncoming
from
the
water
the
ferryboat
looked
like
an
immense
monster
as
it
steamed
majestically
up
the
river
not
wishing
to
attract
attention
to
himself
or
his
companions
joe
shipped
his
oars
and
temporarily
gave
up
the
chase
but
he
remained
close
by
watching
alertly
should
the
ferryboat
fail
to
see
or
pick
up
penny
he
would
be
after
her
upon
the
instant
treading
water
the
girl
shouted
for
help
and
waved
an
arm
her
voice
was
weak
even
to
her
own
ears
and
could
not
possibly
carry
to
the
pilot
house
of
the
would
her
frantic
signals
be
seen
the
night
was
dark
and
she
was
not
yet
in
the
arc
of
the
vessel
lights
penny
swam
a
few
more
strokes
then
treaded
water
again
and
signaled
frantically
the
did
not
slacken
speed
they
have
seen
me
she
thought
desperately
it
useless
now
a
new
danger
presented
itself
the
had
swerved
slightly
so
that
penny
was
directly
in
its
path
still
she
had
not
been
seen
looming
up
in
gigantic
proportions
above
her
the
ferry
threatened
to
run
her
down
chapter
fearful
that
she
would
be
killed
penny
screamed
and
waved
straight
on
steamed
the
so
close
now
that
she
could
see
sally
barker
on
the
starboard
deck
but
the
girl
was
gazing
away
from
her
toward
sweeper
joe
and
the
other
drifting
boat
help
help
screamed
penny
in
one
last
desperate
attempt
to
save
herself
her
cry
carried
for
she
saw
sally
whirl
around
and
stare
intently
at
the
dark
water
ahead
then
she
shouted
an
order
to
her
father
there
came
a
clanging
of
bells
and
the
swerved
to
port
missing
penny
by
a
scant
ten
feet
great
waves
engulfed
her
and
she
fought
to
keep
above
the
surface
her
strength
was
practically
gone
she
rolled
over
on
her
back
gasping
for
breath
then
she
saw
that
the
had
greatly
reduced
speed
and
was
turning
back
on
her
course
a
lifeboat
also
was
being
lowered
they
going
to
pick
me
up
penny
thought
nearly
overcome
by
relief
the
next
minute
sally
and
a
sailor
were
pulling
her
into
the
boat
why
it
penny
and
she
half
drowned
she
heard
her
friend
exclaim
then
she
knew
no
more
when
she
opened
her
eyes
penny
found
herself
in
a
warm
comfortable
bed
sally
stood
beside
her
with
a
cup
of
steaming
hot
soup
you
coming
around
fine
she
praised
drink
this
then
you
feel
better
penny
pulled
herself
up
on
an
elbow
and
took
a
swallow
of
the
soup
it
was
good
and
warmed
her
chilled
body
she
gulped
the
cupful
down
sally
better
not
try
to
talk
too
much
now
sally
advised
kindly
how
did
you
get
into
the
water
the
question
aroused
penny
bringing
back
a
flood
of
memories
she
suddenly
realized
that
she
was
in
sally
cabin
on
the
and
the
ferry
was
moving
where
are
we
she
asked
you
safe
sally
said
soothingly
you
were
swimming
in
the
river
we
nearly
ran
you
down
lucky
i
saw
you
just
in
time
and
we
picked
you
up
yes
i
know
penny
agreed
but
are
we
near
the
harpers
oh
no
we
passed
their
place
long
ago
we
far
upriver
penny
struggled
up
swinging
her
feet
out
of
the
bunk
she
saw
then
that
she
was
wearing
a
pair
of
sally
pajamas
and
that
her
own
wet
garments
hung
over
a
chair
we
must
turn
back
she
cried
tell
captain
barker
please
oh
vitally
important
sally
sally
was
maddeningly
deliberate
now
do
get
excited
penny
she
advised
everything
will
be
all
right
penny
resisted
as
sally
tried
to
push
her
back
into
bed
you
understand
she
protested
sweeper
joe
claude
harper
and
clark
clayton
are
expecting
to
make
their
tonight
they
the
ones
who
have
been
stealing
brass
from
the
gandiss
factory
it
all
cached
in
the
basement
of
the
harper
house
or
was
unless
they
dumped
it
penny
are
you
straight
in
your
head
you
know
what
you
saying
i
certainly
do
i
went
there
this
afternoon
when
i
learned
too
much
they
tried
to
hold
me
prisoner
i
escaped
by
the
river
hid
in
the
grass
patch
but
they
followed
me
there
and
were
about
to
get
me
when
the
steamed
by
i
did
see
two
small
boats
there
just
before
you
shouted
i
wondered
what
they
would
be
doing
at
this
time
of
night
sweeper
joe
and
clark
clayton
have
been
dumping
the
stolen
brass
unless
police
stop
them
before
they
dispose
of
it
all
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
will
be
left
all
those
men
expect
to
leave
town
tonight
thank
heavens
we
have
a
radio
telephone
sally
cried
thoroughly
aroused
i
have
pop
call
the
police
right
away
she
bolted
out
the
cabin
door
every
muscle
and
joint
in
penny
body
ached
but
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
her
misery
her
own
clothes
could
not
be
put
on
searching
in
sally
wardrobe
she
found
a
sweater
and
a
skirt
and
undergarments
she
needed
by
the
time
her
friend
returned
she
was
dressed
penny
you
should
have
gotten
up
sally
protested
quickly
i
ca
afford
to
miss
the
excitement
penny
grinned
hope
you
mind
lending
me
some
of
your
clothes
of
course
not
and
if
you
must
stay
up
you
need
a
pair
of
shoes
sally
found
a
pair
of
sandals
which
although
too
large
would
serve
after
penny
had
put
them
on
she
said
let
go
to
the
pilot
house
because
i
want
you
to
tell
pop
exactly
what
happened
did
you
notify
police
pop
sent
the
message
it
may
take
a
little
while
but
police
should
be
at
the
harpers
almost
anytime
now
those
men
saw
me
taken
aboard
this
boat
penny
worried
i
afraid
they
get
away
before
the
police
arrive
the
girls
climbed
to
the
pilot
house
where
captain
barker
had
just
turned
the
wheel
over
to
a
helmsman
all
members
of
the
crew
remained
aboard
for
with
the
late
on
her
run
there
had
been
no
opportunity
as
yet
to
put
the
men
ashore
we
may
need
all
our
hands
tonight
captain
barker
predicted
no
telling
what
may
develop
i
have
one
of
those
feelings
now
pop
reproved
sally
the
last
time
you
made
a
remark
like
that
we
smashed
a
rudder
remember
aye
i
remember
all
too
well
he
rejoined
grimly
urged
by
sally
penny
related
everything
that
had
happened
at
the
harpers
and
told
of
her
endurance
contest
in
the
grass
patch
we
head
back
that
direction
and
see
what
doing
captain
barker
offered
to
satisfy
her
maybe
we
catch
sight
of
those
rascals
in
their
boats
although
the
cruised
slowly
near
the
shoal
area
where
penny
had
encountered
adventure
there
was
no
sign
of
any
small
boat
the
ferry
crept
dangerously
close
to
the
grass
patch
watch
like
a
cat
captain
barker
warned
the
helmsman
cramp
her
cramp
her
when
the
man
did
not
react
speedily
enough
he
seized
the
wheel
and
helped
spin
it
hard
down
the
responded
readily
moving
into
deeper
waters
satisfied
that
there
were
no
small
boats
in
the
vicinity
captain
barker
headed
upstream
toward
the
harpers
across
the
water
lights
were
to
be
seen
on
both
floors
of
the
river
house
but
so
far
as
could
be
discerned
no
boats
were
tied
up
at
the
pier
or
docks
the
place
is
deserted
that
certain
penny
declared
peering
into
the
wall
of
darkness
how
long
should
it
take
the
police
to
get
there
if
the
radio
message
we
sent
was
properly
transmitted
they
should
be
on
their
way
now
the
captain
replied
sally
impatient
for
action
was
all
for
taking
a
crew
and
descending
upon
the
house
and
its
occupants
puffing
thoughtfully
at
his
pipe
her
father
considered
the
proposal
but
shook
his
head
we
have
no
authority
to
make
a
search
he
pointed
out
any
such
action
would
make
us
liable
for
court
action
just
be
patient
and
you
see
fireworks
knowing
that
to
stand
by
near
the
harpers
pier
would
warn
the
house
occupants
they
were
being
watched
captain
barker
ordered
the
to
turn
downriver
toward
the
main
freight
and
passenger
docks
an
excursion
boat
the
passed
them
her
railings
lined
with
women
and
children
who
had
enjoyed
an
outing
and
were
returning
home
the
steamer
tied
up
at
the
ninth
street
dock
and
began
to
disgorge
passengers
then
it
happened
penny
saw
a
sudden
flash
of
flame
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
hold
of
the
excursion
ship
the
next
instant
fire
shot
from
the
portholes
and
began
to
spread
captain
barker
gave
a
hoarse
shout
which
sent
a
chill
down
her
spine
the
he
exclaimed
huskily
her
oil
tanks
must
have
exploded
she
go
up
like
matchwood
and
with
all
those
women
and
children
aboard
chapter
barker
never
did
a
fire
seem
to
spread
so
rapidly
in
less
than
three
minutes
as
those
aboard
the
watched
in
helpless
horror
the
became
a
mass
of
flames
from
stem
to
stern
terrified
passengers
jammed
the
gangplank
as
they
tried
to
crowd
ashore
some
of
them
leaped
from
the
excursion
boat
high
railings
to
the
dock
below
her
mooring
lines
are
ablaze
captain
barker
shouted
a
moment
later
and
the
freight
sheds
are
catching
afire
penny
added
observing
a
telltale
line
of
flame
starting
from
the
flimsy
wooden
buildings
along
the
wharf
directly
back
of
the
dock
where
the
had
moored
the
blazing
sheds
worried
captain
barker
far
less
than
the
fact
that
the
mooring
lines
had
caught
fire
if
the
should
be
cut
loose
from
the
dock
helpless
women
and
children
would
be
carried
out
onto
the
river
in
a
flaming
inferno
why
do
the
fire
boats
get
here
sally
murmured
nervously
oh
this
is
going
to
be
a
dreadful
disaster
if
something
is
done
to
save
those
helpless
people
at
the
bridge
leading
to
the
pilot
house
captain
barker
stood
tensely
watching
his
hand
on
the
signal
ropes
there
go
the
mooring
lines
he
shouted
the
current
should
bring
her
this
way
as
the
slowly
drifted
away
from
the
blazing
wharf
men
and
women
began
to
leap
over
the
railings
into
the
dark
waters
man
the
lifeboats
captain
barker
ordered
his
crew
tersely
i
going
to
try
to
get
a
tow
line
on
he
signaled
the
engine
room
and
the
began
to
back
rapidly
toward
the
flaming
excursion
boat
penny
and
sally
ran
to
help
launch
the
lifeboats
with
the
desperately
short
handed
they
would
be
needed
to
handle
oars
a
fireman
an
engineer
captain
barker
and
a
helmsman
must
remain
at
their
posts
which
left
only
three
sailors
to
pick
up
passengers
leaping
into
the
first
boat
launched
the
girls
rowed
into
the
path
of
the
blazing
vessel
in
its
bright
glow
against
the
sky
they
could
see
passengers
running
about
the
decks
an
increasing
number
were
leaping
into
the
water
and
many
could
not
swim
ignoring
the
cries
of
those
who
had
life
belts
or
were
swimming
strongly
they
rapidly
picked
up
survivors
to
pull
children
aboard
was
a
comparatively
easy
task
but
many
of
the
women
were
heavy
and
the
combined
strength
of
the
girls
barely
was
sufficient
to
get
them
into
the
boat
without
upsetting
finally
the
lifeboat
was
filled
beyond
capacity
and
they
turned
to
land
their
cargo
aboard
the
only
then
did
they
see
what
captain
barker
intended
to
do
his
men
had
succeeded
in
making
a
line
fast
to
the
stern
by
this
time
the
excursion
boat
was
a
flaming
inferno
with
only
a
few
passengers
the
captain
and
crew
remaining
aboard
pop
going
to
tow
the
downstream
away
from
the
freight
sheds
sally
cried
some
of
those
buildings
are
filled
with
war
materials
awaiting
shipment
coal
oil
and
i
do
know
what
all
if
a
fire
once
gets
going
there
nothing
will
stop
it
working
feverishly
the
girls
unloaded
their
passengers
and
went
back
for
more
motorboats
had
set
out
from
shore
and
they
too
aided
in
the
rescue
work
some
of
the
survivors
were
taken
to
land
and
others
were
put
aboard
the
aided
by
a
sailor
they
had
picked
up
the
girls
worked
until
they
no
longer
could
see
bobbing
heads
in
the
swirling
waters
we
done
all
we
can
sally
gasped
as
they
helped
the
last
of
the
passengers
aboard
the
the
captain
and
most
of
his
men
will
stay
on
the
as
long
as
they
are
able
though
exhausted
by
their
work
the
girls
did
what
they
could
for
those
aboard
sally
distributed
all
the
blankets
she
could
find
and
penny
helped
a
sailor
revive
two
women
who
were
unconscious
from
having
swallowed
too
much
water
suddenly
there
came
a
loud
report
like
the
crack
of
a
pistol
the
tow
line
to
the
had
parted
once
more
the
excursion
boat
now
a
roaring
furnace
was
adrift
in
in
an
instant
it
was
apparent
to
penny
what
would
happen
the
was
strong
and
in
a
minute
or
two
would
carry
the
burning
vessel
into
the
wharves
and
sheds
when
the
boat
struck
flying
sparks
would
ignite
the
dry
wood
for
a
considerable
distance
and
soon
the
entire
waterfront
would
be
ablaze
though
outwardly
calm
captain
barker
was
beset
as
he
appraised
the
situation
it
would
not
be
possible
to
get
another
tow
line
onto
the
for
already
her
decks
had
become
untenable
for
the
crew
the
blazing
vessel
was
drifting
rapidly
we
could
ram
her
he
muttered
she
might
be
nosed
out
into
the
channel
again
and
headed
away
from
the
freight
docks
would
that
be
dangerous
sally
asked
anxiously
we
have
at
least
fifty
passengers
aboard
in
this
high
wind
the
would
be
almost
certain
to
catch
fire
there
nothing
else
to
do
captain
barker
decided
grimly
signaling
the
engine
room
the
is
drifting
fast
and
before
the
fire
boats
can
get
here
half
the
waterfront
will
be
ablaze
have
the
passengers
wet
down
the
decks
and
stand
by
with
buckets
penny
and
sally
worked
feverishly
carrying
out
orders
the
deck
hose
was
attached
and
buckets
were
brought
from
below
and
filled
with
water
all
survivors
who
were
able
to
help
cooperated
to
the
fullest
extent
helping
wet
down
the
decks
and
assisting
women
and
children
to
the
stern
of
the
ferryboat
captain
barker
had
given
an
order
for
the
to
move
full
speed
ahead
in
a
moment
the
two
boats
made
jarring
contact
penny
was
thrown
from
her
feet
scrambling
up
she
saw
that
blazing
timbers
from
the
had
crashed
directly
onto
the
deck
sparks
were
falling
everywhere
the
ferryboat
had
caught
fire
in
a
dozen
places
seizing
a
bucket
of
water
she
doused
out
the
flames
nearest
her
heat
from
the
was
intense
and
many
of
the
men
who
had
volunteered
to
help
began
to
retreat
penny
and
sally
stuck
at
their
post
knowing
that
the
lives
of
all
depended
upon
extinguishing
the
flames
quickly
crew
members
of
the
worked
beside
them
with
quiet
determined
efficiency
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
the
final
boatload
of
survivors
had
to
be
taken
aboard
captain
jamison
one
of
the
last
to
leave
the
collapsed
as
he
reached
the
deck
severely
burned
he
was
carried
below
to
receive
treatment
undaunted
captain
barker
shouted
terse
orders
goading
the
men
to
greater
activity
when
the
flames
showed
signs
of
getting
beyond
control
after
the
first
contact
with
the
florence
only
occasional
sparks
ignited
the
decks
but
the
heat
was
terrific
women
and
children
became
hysterical
fearful
that
the
ferryboat
would
become
a
flaming
torch
the
worst
is
over
now
sally
sighed
as
she
and
penny
refilled
water
buckets
pop
knows
what
he
doing
he
saved
the
waterfront
but
this
ferryboat
it
still
may
go
up
in
smoke
but
i
do
think
so
sally
replied
calmly
pop
is
heading
so
that
the
wind
will
carry
the
flames
away
from
us
he
beach
the
on
horseshoe
shoal
and
let
the
wreck
burn
to
the
water
edge
for
the
next
fifteen
minutes
there
was
no
lessening
of
worry
aboard
the
the
ferryboat
clung
grimly
to
the
blazing
excursion
boat
losing
contact
at
times
then
picking
her
up
again
and
pushing
on
toward
the
shoal
fire
fighting
activities
aboard
the
ferryboat
became
better
organized
the
passengers
observing
that
captain
barker
knew
what
he
was
about
became
calm
and
easily
managed
by
the
time
fire
boats
arrived
to
spray
the
with
streams
of
pressured
water
the
situation
was
well
in
hand
collapsing
on
the
deck
from
sheer
exhaustion
penny
and
sally
gazed
toward
the
warehouses
and
docks
on
the
opposite
shore
only
one
fire
of
any
size
was
visible
there
the
fire
boats
will
quickly
put
it
out
sally
said
confidently
but
i
hate
to
think
what
would
have
happened
if
the
wind
and
current
had
driven
the
along
those
wharves
penny
wiped
her
cheek
and
saw
that
her
hand
was
covered
with
black
soot
sally
too
was
a
sight
she
had
ripped
the
hem
from
her
skirt
her
hair
was
an
untidy
mess
everything
about
her
was
pungent
with
smoke
where
were
we
when
all
this
excitement
started
penny
asked
presently
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
we
had
sent
out
a
police
call
for
claude
harper
and
his
pals
to
be
arrested
it
all
seems
vague
in
my
mind
as
if
it
occurred
a
million
years
ago
why
i
had
forgotten
too
sally
gasped
i
hope
the
police
went
there
and
caught
those
men
before
they
made
a
scrambling
to
their
feet
the
girls
moved
to
the
starboard
side
of
the
which
permitted
a
view
of
the
harper
house
far
upriver
they
were
startled
and
dismayed
to
see
tongues
of
flame
shooting
from
a
window
that
place
has
caught
on
fire
too
sally
exclaimed
then
corrected
herself
but
sparks
from
the
never
could
have
been
carried
so
far
the
house
has
been
set
afire
on
purpose
penny
cried
oh
sally
you
see
it
a
trick
to
destroy
all
the
evidence
hidden
there
the
harpers
intend
to
skip
town
tonight
and
they
taking
advantage
of
this
fire
to
make
it
appear
that
destruction
of
the
house
is
accidental
chapter
sick
at
heart
the
two
girls
realized
with
the
harper
house
aflame
their
last
chance
of
proving
the
guilt
of
the
brass
thieves
might
be
gone
as
they
stood
at
the
railing
of
the
gloomily
watching
the
spreading
creeping
line
of
fire
a
motorboat
chugged
up
ahoy
shouted
a
familiar
voice
can
you
take
aboard
three
more
survivors
they
the
very
last
we
can
find
on
the
river
it
jack
penny
cried
recognizing
his
voice
though
unable
to
see
his
face
in
the
dark
after
we
get
the
passengers
aboard
perhaps
he
take
us
upriver
to
the
harpers
the
girls
ran
to
help
with
the
new
arrivals
but
sailors
already
had
lifted
them
from
the
boat
and
carried
them
aboard
the
this
is
my
last
load
jack
called
out
nearly
everyone
was
saved
coast
guard
boats
are
patrolling
now
and
if
there
are
other
survivors
they
be
taken
ashore
jack
penny
called
down
to
him
that
you
penny
he
demanded
in
astonishment
why
did
you
come
back
to
shadow
island
this
afternoon
we
all
been
worried
about
you
it
a
long
story
and
there
no
time
to
tell
it
now
jack
will
you
take
us
to
the
harpers
in
your
motorboat
now
yes
the
house
is
on
fire
helping
the
girls
into
the
boat
jack
turned
to
gaze
upstream
strange
he
exclaimed
how
could
sparks
from
the
have
carried
so
far
the
answer
is
they
did
penny
said
grimly
the
house
was
set
afire
on
purpose
just
get
us
to
the
pier
as
quickly
as
you
can
somewhere
along
the
shore
a
big
city
clock
struck
the
hour
of
midnight
the
young
people
did
not
notice
as
the
boat
raced
over
the
water
bouncing
as
it
struck
each
high
wave
they
discussed
what
had
happened
just
prior
to
the
outbreak
of
fire
aboard
the
i
know
part
of
the
stolen
brass
was
dumped
into
the
river
by
sweeper
joe
penny
revealed
excitedly
the
remainder
was
locked
in
the
basement
of
the
harper
house
the
last
i
knew
and
i
satisfied
the
brass
lantern
taken
from
the
by
adam
glowershick
is
among
the
loot
all
the
thieves
expect
to
skip
town
tonight
probably
they
gone
by
this
time
beaching
the
boat
some
distance
from
the
burning
house
the
three
young
people
ran
up
the
slope
firemen
had
not
yet
reached
the
scene
and
the
few
persons
who
had
gathered
were
watching
the
flames
but
making
no
effort
to
battle
them
it
a
hopeless
proposition
jack
commented
this
far
from
the
city
there
no
water
pressure
the
house
will
burn
to
the
ground
and
all
the
evidence
with
it
penny
added
gloomily
what
miserable
luck
no
boats
were
tied
up
at
the
dock
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
the
harpers
or
their
friends
in
the
crowd
obviously
the
entire
party
had
fled
is
there
some
place
where
we
can
telephone
the
police
penny
suggested
impatiently
if
they
act
quickly
these
men
still
may
be
caught
they
ca
be
very
far
away
the
nearest
house
is
up
the
beach
about
an
eighth
of
a
mile
jack
informed
maybe
we
can
telephone
from
there
you
two
go
sally
said
casually
i
want
to
stay
here
at
the
moment
jack
and
penny
intent
only
upon
their
mission
thought
nothing
about
the
remark
following
the
paved
road
which
made
walking
easy
they
hastened
as
fast
as
they
could
jack
penny
said
puffing
to
keep
pace
with
him
there
something
i
want
to
ask
you
shoot
why
have
you
felt
so
friendly
toward
that
crook
glowershick
jack
eyebrows
jerked
upward
and
he
gave
a
snort
of
disgust
whatever
gave
you
that
crazy
idea
well
he
came
to
the
island
and
you
borrowed
money
from
me
to
give
him
so
you
recognized
him
that
day
yes
penny
answered
quietly
you
tried
to
hide
his
identity
so
i
said
nothing
more
i
kept
thinking
you
would
explain
i
prepared
to
pay
you
what
i
owe
penny
oh
jack
it
not
the
money
do
you
understand
you
think
i
had
a
finger
in
lifting
the
brass
lantern
from
the
jack
said
stiffly
gracious
no
but
should
you
explain
jack
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
thanks
penny
for
having
a
little
faith
in
me
i
know
i
been
an
awful
sap
suppose
you
tell
me
all
about
it
there
nothing
to
tell
i
went
to
the
harpers
a
number
of
times
attended
their
dances
and
spent
a
lot
of
money
i
got
into
debt
to
that
fellow
glowershick
and
he
pressed
me
for
it
there
was
nothing
more
to
it
not
a
thing
except
that
i
did
want
my
folks
to
hear
about
it
why
i
pretended
i
did
know
glowershick
i
was
afraid
you
would
tell
them
do
you
believe
me
oh
i
do
jack
i
so
relieved
and
the
jitterbug
girl
at
harpers
oh
jack
said
scornfully
she
was
a
stupid
thing
and
i
see
how
i
stood
her
silly
chatter
most
of
the
money
i
borrowed
from
glowershick
was
spent
on
her
as
i
said
i
was
a
complete
chump
reaching
a
house
some
distance
back
from
the
river
they
found
the
owner
at
home
and
were
given
permission
to
telephone
the
police
jack
was
promised
by
an
inspector
that
all
police
cruisers
would
be
ordered
to
watch
for
the
escaped
brass
thieves
railroad
terminals
bus
depots
and
all
roads
leading
from
the
city
would
be
guarded
watch
the
riverfront
too
jack
urged
the
men
may
have
gone
by
boat
to
tate
beach
intending
to
catch
a
train
from
there
satisfied
they
had
done
everything
possible
penny
and
jack
hastened
back
to
the
harpers
the
sky
was
tinted
pink
and
flames
now
shot
from
the
roof
of
the
house
a
large
crowd
had
gathered
and
there
was
excited
talk
and
gesturing
something
wrong
penny
observed
anxiously
pushing
through
the
crowd
they
sought
vainly
to
find
sally
a
woman
was
talking
excitedly
pointed
toward
the
flaming
building
i
tell
you
i
saw
a
girl
run
in
there
only
a
few
minutes
ago
she
insisted
and
she
did
come
out
she
must
be
in
there
now
the
words
shocked
penny
and
jack
as
the
same
thought
came
to
them
could
it
be
that
reckless
sally
had
ventured
into
the
basement
of
the
house
hoping
to
recover
the
brass
lantern
or
other
evidence
which
would
incriminate
the
thieves
she
acted
funny
when
we
left
her
here
penny
whispered
in
horror
oh
jack
if
she
inside
the
building
pushing
through
the
crowd
she
grasped
the
arm
of
the
woman
who
was
talking
who
was
the
girl
what
was
she
wearing
she
demanded
tensely
a
blue
sweater
the
woman
recalled
her
hair
was
flying
wild
and
her
face
was
streaked
with
dirt
as
if
she
already
been
in
the
fire
i
thought
maybe
she
lived
here
it
was
sally
penny
murmured
her
heart
sinking
to
her
shoe
tops
why
has
someone
brought
her
out
no
human
being
could
get
into
that
house
now
declared
a
man
who
stood
close
by
the
firemen
are
here
yet
anyway
we
ai
sure
anyone
inside
i
saw
the
girl
run
in
i
tell
you
the
woman
insisted
to
debate
over
such
a
vital
matter
infuriated
penny
and
jack
sally
was
nowhere
in
the
crowd
and
they
were
convinced
she
had
entered
the
blazing
building
flames
were
blowing
from
some
of
the
lower
windows
and
smoke
was
dense
it
was
obvious
that
no
man
present
was
willing
to
risk
his
life
to
ascertain
if
the
girl
were
inside
she
must
have
tried
to
reach
the
basement
penny
cried
oh
jack
we
got
to
bring
her
out
nodding
grimly
jack
stripped
off
his
coat
throwing
it
over
his
head
as
a
shield
he
darted
into
the
burning
building
penny
close
at
his
heels
had
no
protection
inside
the
house
smoke
was
so
black
they
could
not
see
three
feet
ahead
choking
gasping
for
breath
they
groped
their
way
through
the
living
room
to
the
kitchen
penny
jerked
open
the
door
leading
into
the
cellar
flames
roared
into
her
face
the
entire
basement
was
an
inferno
of
heat
no
human
being
could
descend
the
stairs
and
return
if
sally
were
below
she
was
beyond
help
closing
the
door
penny
staggered
backwards
her
head
was
spinning
and
she
could
not
get
her
breath
it
no
use
jack
shouted
in
her
ear
we
got
to
get
out
of
here
the
walls
or
floor
may
collapse
clutching
penny
arm
he
pulled
her
along
in
the
black
smoke
swirling
about
them
they
missed
the
kitchen
door
frantically
they
crept
along
a
scorching
hot
wall
seeking
to
find
an
exit
then
penny
stumbled
over
an
object
on
the
floor
and
fell
as
she
tried
to
get
up
her
hand
touched
something
soft
and
yielding
a
body
lay
sprawled
in
a
heap
beside
her
on
the
floor
it
sally
she
cried
oh
jack
help
me
get
her
up
chapter
the
sally
moaned
softly
but
did
not
stir
as
penny
tried
to
pull
her
to
a
sitting
position
the
heat
now
was
almost
unbearably
intense
with
flying
brands
dropping
everywhere
but
near
the
floor
the
air
was
better
and
penny
drew
it
in
by
deep
gulps
jack
groping
hand
encountered
the
sink
soaking
his
coat
with
water
from
one
of
the
taps
he
gave
it
to
penny
to
protect
her
head
and
shoulders
help
me
get
sally
onto
my
back
in
a
fireman
carry
he
gasped
we
can
make
it
the
confidence
in
jack
voice
gave
penny
new
courage
and
strength
as
he
knelt
down
on
the
floor
she
dragged
sally
onto
his
back
holding
the
inert
body
high
on
his
shoulders
he
staggered
across
the
kitchen
penny
guided
him
to
the
door
flames
had
eaten
into
the
living
room
and
a
small
portion
of
the
floor
had
fallen
through
to
reach
the
exit
was
impossible
a
window
jack
directed
penny
could
see
none
so
dense
was
the
smoke
but
she
remembered
how
the
room
had
been
laid
out
and
pulled
jack
to
an
outer
wall
her
exploring
hand
encountered
a
window
sill
but
she
could
not
get
the
sash
up
in
desperation
she
kicked
out
the
glass
a
rush
of
cool
sweet
air
struck
her
face
filling
her
lungs
she
turned
to
help
jack
with
his
burden
before
she
could
grasp
him
he
sagged
slowly
to
the
floor
thrusting
her
head
through
the
broken
window
penny
shouted
for
help
willing
hands
lifted
her
to
safety
and
two
men
climbed
through
the
window
to
bring
out
jack
and
sally
both
were
carried
some
distance
from
the
blazing
building
to
an
automobile
where
they
were
revived
however
sally
was
in
need
of
medical
attention
hair
and
eyebrows
had
been
singed
half
away
and
more
serious
her
hands
and
arms
were
severely
burned
jack
and
penny
rode
with
her
to
the
hospital
when
the
ambulance
finally
came
not
until
hours
later
after
captain
barker
had
been
summoned
did
sally
know
anyone
heavily
bandaged
with
her
father
jack
and
penny
at
her
bedside
she
opened
her
eyes
and
gave
them
a
grin
the
she
whispered
safely
beached
on
a
shoal
captain
barker
assured
her
tenderly
there
nothing
to
worry
about
all
the
passengers
have
been
taken
to
hospitals
or
to
their
homes
a
preliminary
check
has
shown
only
one
man
lost
an
engineer
who
was
trapped
at
his
post
when
the
explosion
occurred
aboard
the
pop
you
were
marvelous
sally
whispered
you
saved
the
waterfront
and
nearly
lost
a
daughter
sally
why
did
you
try
to
get
into
that
burning
building
sally
drew
a
deep
tired
sigh
never
mind
said
penny
kindly
we
know
why
you
went
in
it
was
to
find
the
brass
lantern
sally
nodded
when
i
got
to
the
basement
flames
were
shooting
up
everywhere
she
recalled
with
a
shudder
i
realized
then
that
i
could
possibly
find
the
lantern
or
anything
else
i
tried
to
get
back
but
smoke
was
everywhere
that
was
the
last
i
remembered
it
was
jack
who
saved
you
penny
said
but
he
cut
in
to
insist
that
the
credit
belonged
to
her
rather
than
to
him
in
the
midst
of
a
argument
over
the
subject
a
nurse
came
to
say
that
penny
and
jack
both
were
wanted
on
the
telephone
the
police
department
calling
she
explained
they
were
down
the
hall
in
a
flash
to
take
the
call
captain
brown
of
the
city
police
force
informed
them
they
were
wanted
immediately
at
police
headquarters
to
identify
sweeper
joe
the
harpers
and
clark
clayton
who
had
been
arrested
at
the
railroad
station
adam
glowershick
also
had
been
taken
into
custody
at
headquarters
fifteen
minutes
later
the
young
people
found
gandiss
penny
father
and
heiney
growski
already
there
questioned
by
police
the
young
people
revealed
everything
they
knew
about
the
case
we
can
hold
these
men
for
a
while
chief
bailey
promised
gandiss
but
to
make
charges
stick
we
have
to
have
more
evidence
penny
had
told
of
the
cache
of
brass
in
the
harper
basement
and
also
of
seeing
sweeper
joe
and
clark
clayton
dump
much
of
the
loot
in
the
river
she
was
assured
that
the
ruins
of
the
house
would
be
searched
in
the
morning
and
that
a
dredge
would
be
assigned
to
try
to
locate
the
brass
which
had
been
thrown
overboard
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
heiney
growski
produced
records
he
had
kept
showing
a
list
of
gandiss
factory
employes
known
to
be
implicated
in
the
plot
most
of
the
persons
involved
are
new
employes
who
smuggled
small
pieces
of
brass
out
of
the
factory
and
turned
them
over
to
sweeper
joe
for
pin
money
he
revealed
the
leaders
are
joe
clayton
and
glowershick
with
them
behind
bars
the
ring
will
dissolve
there
one
thing
i
want
to
know
penny
declared
feelingly
who
planted
the
brass
in
sally
locker
while
she
was
working
at
the
factory
no
one
could
answer
the
question
at
the
moment
but
the
following
day
after
police
had
repeatedly
questioned
the
prisoners
the
entire
story
became
known
sweeper
joe
the
real
instigator
of
the
plot
had
slipped
into
the
locker
room
himself
and
had
placed
the
incriminating
piece
of
evidence
in
sally
locker
using
a
master
key
he
had
disliked
her
because
several
times
she
had
resented
his
attempts
to
become
friendly
although
police
had
obtained
signed
confessions
tangible
evidence
also
was
needed
for
as
chief
bailey
pointed
out
to
gandiss
the
men
might
repudiate
their
statements
when
they
appeared
in
court
accordingly
police
squads
were
sent
to
the
harpers
to
search
the
ashes
for
evidence
and
also
to
the
river
to
supervise
dredging
operations
throughout
the
day
between
trips
to
the
hospital
to
see
sally
jack
and
penny
watched
the
dredge
boat
make
its
trips
back
and
forth
over
the
area
where
the
loot
had
been
dropped
i
hope
i
was
mistaken
in
the
location
penny
remarked
anxiously
as
the
vessel
made
repeated
excursions
without
success
after
all
the
night
was
dark
and
i
had
no
way
of
taking
accurate
bearings
across
the
river
and
barely
visible
the
blackened
smoking
skeleton
of
the
lay
stranded
on
a
sandbar
throughout
the
night
a
fireboat
had
steadily
pumped
water
into
the
burning
vessel
but
even
so
fires
had
not
been
entirely
extinguished
morning
papers
had
carried
the
encouraging
information
that
there
was
only
one
known
casualty
as
a
result
of
the
disaster
that
many
lives
had
not
been
lost
was
credited
entirely
to
the
courageous
action
of
captain
barker
becoming
weary
of
watching
the
monotonous
dredging
operations
jack
and
penny
joined
a
throng
of
curious
bystanders
at
the
harper
property
police
had
taken
complete
charge
and
were
raking
the
smoldering
ruins
find
anything
jack
asked
a
policeman
he
knew
the
man
pointed
to
a
small
heap
of
charred
metal
which
had
been
taken
from
the
basement
there
were
many
pieces
of
brass
but
the
missing
lantern
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
pile
however
from
a
member
of
the
arson
squad
they
learned
that
enough
evidence
had
been
found
to
prove
conclusively
that
the
fire
had
been
started
with
gasoline
ma
harper
spilled
the
whole
story
one
of
the
policemen
related
she
and
her
husband
were
fairly
straight
until
they
became
mixed
up
with
sweeper
joe
who
has
a
police
record
of
long
standing
ma
had
a
black
market
business
in
silk
stockings
that
did
amount
to
much
so
far
as
we
been
able
to
learn
she
and
a
taxi
driver
whom
we
caught
were
the
only
ones
involved
her
husband
and
the
other
men
considered
the
stocking
racket
small
potatoes
for
them
after
talking
with
the
policemen
for
awhile
the
young
people
wandered
down
to
the
river
edge
to
see
how
dredging
operations
progressed
they
hauling
something
out
of
the
water
now
jack
exclaimed
by
george
it
looks
like
brass
to
me
finding
a
boat
tied
up
at
the
dock
they
borrowed
it
and
rowed
rapidly
out
to
the
dredge
there
they
saw
that
some
of
the
metal
which
sweeper
joe
had
dumped
had
indeed
been
recovered
prodding
in
the
muddy
pile
in
the
bottom
of
the
dredge
net
penny
uttered
a
little
scream
of
joy
the
brass
lantern
is
here
jack
what
wonderful
luck
seizing
the
object
she
washed
it
in
the
river
let
take
it
straight
to
sally
at
the
hospital
she
urged
because
the
lantern
would
be
important
evidence
in
the
case
against
glowershick
police
aboard
the
dredge
were
unwilling
for
it
to
be
removed
however
the
young
people
carried
the
news
to
sally
oh
i
so
glad
the
lantern
has
been
recovered
she
cried
happily
jack
you
win
it
in
the
race
friday
jack
and
penny
exchanged
a
quick
stricken
glance
temporarily
they
had
forgotten
the
race
and
all
it
meant
to
sally
with
her
hands
bandaged
from
painful
burns
she
never
would
be
able
to
compete
we
postpone
the
race
jack
said
gruffly
it
would
be
no
competition
if
we
held
it
without
you
nonsense
replied
sally
it
will
be
weeks
before
i
can
use
my
hands
well
so
it
would
be
stupid
to
postpone
the
race
that
long
fortunately
the
doctor
says
i
may
leave
the
hospital
tomorrow
and
i
not
be
scarred
if
you
ca
race
i
wo
either
declared
jack
stubbornly
jack
you
must
agitated
sally
raised
herself
on
an
elbow
i
feel
dreadful
if
you
did
compete
the
race
has
meant
everything
to
you
not
any
more
winning
does
seem
important
now
i
not
sail
in
the
race
unless
the
is
entered
and
that
final
oh
jack
you
such
an
old
mule
sally
tossed
her
head
impatiently
on
the
pillow
then
she
grinned
if
my
is
in
the
race
you
sail
sure
he
agreed
suspecting
no
trick
sally
laughed
gleefully
then
it
settled
penny
will
represent
me
in
the
race
i
do
what
demanded
penny
you
skipper
the
boat
in
my
stead
but
i
lack
experience
you
win
the
trophy
easily
chuckled
sally
why
the
is
by
far
the
fastest
boat
on
the
river
says
who
demanded
jack
but
without
his
old
fire
but
i
could
race
alone
said
penny
decidedly
worried
sally
would
you
be
able
to
ride
along
as
adviser
and
captain
bold
i
certainly
would
jump
at
the
chance
if
the
doctor
would
give
permission
oh
penny
if
only
he
would
the
race
is
until
friday
jack
said
encouragingly
you
can
make
it
sally
the
girl
pulled
herself
to
a
sitting
posture
staring
at
her
bandaged
hands
yes
i
can
she
agreed
with
quiet
finality
why
i
feel
better
already
even
if
i
have
to
be
carried
to
the
dock
in
a
wheel
chair
be
in
that
race
chapter
a
sun
beat
down
upon
the
wharves
as
a
group
of
sailboats
tacked
slowly
toward
the
starting
line
for
the
annual
hat
island
trophy
race
the
shores
were
lined
with
spectators
and
from
the
clubhouse
where
a
band
played
music
carried
over
the
water
at
the
tiller
of
the
penny
in
white
blouse
and
slacks
hair
bound
tightly
to
keep
it
from
blowing
sat
nervous
and
tense
sally
lounging
on
a
cushion
in
the
bow
seemed
thoroughly
relaxed
though
her
arms
remained
in
bandages
otherwise
she
had
completely
recovered
from
her
unpleasant
experience
is
the
wind
dying
penny
asked
anxiously
oh
sally
i
was
hoping
we
have
a
good
stiff
breeze
for
the
race
handicapped
as
we
are
we
not
handicapped
sally
corrected
of
course
i
ca
handle
the
ropes
or
do
much
to
help
but
we
have
a
wonderful
boat
that
will
prove
more
than
a
match
for
jack
you
only
saying
that
to
give
me
confidence
no
i
not
sally
denied
turning
to
study
the
group
of
racing
boats
we
win
the
trophy
just
wait
and
see
if
we
do
it
will
be
because
of
your
brain
and
my
brawn
penny
chuckled
i
admit
i
scared
silly
i
never
was
in
an
important
race
before
conversation
ceased
for
the
boats
now
were
bunching
close
to
the
starting
line
maneuvering
for
position
jack
drifted
by
in
the
raising
his
hand
in
friendly
greeting
as
he
passed
he
actually
glanced
anxiously
toward
sally
as
if
worried
lest
the
girl
overtax
herself
i
hope
he
does
try
to
throw
the
race
just
to
be
gallant
penny
thought
but
i
do
believe
he
will
for
then
the
victory
would
be
a
hollow
one
the
change
apparent
in
jack
so
amazed
penny
that
she
had
to
pinch
herself
to
realize
it
was
true
since
the
night
of
the
fire
he
had
visited
sally
every
day
in
a
brief
span
of
hours
he
had
grown
from
a
selfish
arrogant
youth
into
a
steady
dependable
man
and
it
now
was
evident
to
everyone
that
he
liked
sally
in
more
than
a
friendly
way
better
come
about
now
penny
sally
broke
in
upon
her
thoughts
head
for
the
starting
line
the
signal
should
be
given
any
minute
now
the
boats
started
in
a
close
tight
group
jack
was
over
the
line
first
but
with
directly
behind
in
the
first
leg
of
the
race
the
two
boats
kept
fairly
even
with
the
others
lagging
as
the
initial
marker
was
rounded
there
was
a
noticeable
in
the
wind
it
going
to
be
a
drifting
race
sally
confirmed
raising
troubled
eyes
to
the
wrinkled
sail
we
barely
drawing
now
and
jack
boat
has
the
edge
in
a
calm
the
skimmed
merrily
along
now
in
the
lead
by
many
yards
though
penny
held
the
tiller
delicately
taking
advantage
of
every
breath
of
wind
the
distance
between
the
two
boats
rapidly
increased
we
out
of
it
she
sighed
we
ca
hope
to
overtake
jack
now
sally
nodded
gloomily
shading
her
eyes
against
the
glare
of
the
sun
she
gazed
across
the
river
studying
the
triangular
course
far
well
beyond
the
line
the
and
their
own
boat
was
taking
the
surface
of
the
water
appeared
rippled
ahead
of
them
there
was
only
a
smooth
surface
penny
she
said
quietly
i
believe
there
more
breeze
out
there
penny
nodded
and
headed
the
on
the
longer
course
out
into
the
river
to
many
spectators
ashore
it
appeared
that
the
girls
deliberately
had
abandoned
the
race
but
aboard
the
captain
barker
grinned
proudly
at
his
guests
parker
and
and
gandiss
those
gals
are
using
their
heads
he
praised
well
gandiss
it
looks
as
if
the
barkers
will
keep
the
trophy
another
year
the
race
is
over
yet
gandiss
rumbled
goodnaturedly
aboard
the
penny
and
sally
were
none
too
jubilant
although
sails
curved
with
wind
and
they
were
footing
much
faster
than
the
other
boats
the
course
they
had
chosen
would
force
them
to
sail
a
much
longer
distance
could
they
cross
the
finish
line
ahead
of
the
should
we
turn
now
penny
asked
impatiently
jack
so
much
closer
than
we
not
yet
sally
said
calmly
we
must
make
it
in
one
long
tack
he
will
be
forced
to
make
several
that
our
only
chance
if
we
misjudge
the
distance
we
sunk
tensely
they
watched
the
moving
line
of
boats
close
along
shore
the
seemed
almost
at
the
finish
line
though
her
sails
barely
were
drawing
and
she
moved
through
the
water
at
a
snail
pace
again
penny
glanced
anxiously
at
her
companion
now
sally
gave
the
signal
instantly
penny
swung
the
onto
the
homeward
tack
every
inch
of
her
sails
drawing
she
swept
toward
the
finish
line
we
so
much
farther
away
than
the
penny
groaned
crouching
low
so
that
her
body
would
not
deflect
the
wind
oh
sally
will
we
make
it
ca
tell
yet
it
will
be
nip
and
tuck
but
if
we
can
keep
this
breeze
the
wind
held
and
the
sailing
to
windward
of
the
finish
line
moved
along
faster
and
faster
on
the
other
hand
the
was
forced
to
make
several
short
tacks
losing
distance
each
time
the
boats
drew
even
suddenly
sally
relaxed
and
slumped
down
on
the
cushions
just
hold
the
old
girl
steady
on
her
course
she
grinned
that
brass
lantern
is
the
same
as
ours
then
we
win
we
ca
lose
now
unless
some
disaster
should
overtake
us
even
as
sally
spoke
boat
whistles
began
to
toot
sailing
experts
nodded
their
heads
in
a
pleased
way
for
it
was
a
race
to
their
liking
a
minute
later
sweeping
in
like
a
house
afire
the
crossed
the
finish
line
well
in
advance
of
the
jack
boat
placed
second
with
other
craft
far
behind
friendly
hands
assisted
the
girls
ashore
where
they
were
spirited
away
to
the
clubhouse
for
rest
and
refreshments
as
everyone
crowded
about
to
congratulate
them
upon
victory
jack
joined
the
throng
it
was
a
dandy
race
he
said
with
sincerity
i
tried
hard
to
win
but
you
outsmarted
me
why
jack
teased
sally
imagine
admitting
a
thing
like
that
now
do
try
to
rub
it
in
he
pleaded
i
know
i
been
an
awful
heel
you
probably
wo
believe
me
but
i
sorry
about
the
way
i
acted
for
goodness
sakes
do
apologize
sally
cut
him
short
i
enjoyed
every
one
of
those
squabbles
we
had
i
hope
we
have
a
lot
more
of
them
we
probably
will
jack
warned
because
i
expect
to
be
underfoot
quite
a
bit
of
the
time
later
in
the
afternoon
the
brass
lantern
which
had
been
turned
over
to
the
club
by
the
police
was
formally
presented
to
sally
she
was
warned
however
that
the
trophy
would
have
to
be
returned
later
for
use
in
court
as
evidence
against
adam
glowershick
the
nicest
surprise
of
all
was
yet
to
come
captain
barker
was
requested
by
a
committee
chairman
to
kindly
step
forward
into
full
view
of
the
spectators
now
what
this
he
rumbled
edging
away
but
he
could
not
escape
speaking
into
a
loudspeaker
the
committee
chairman
informed
the
captain
and
delighted
spectators
that
in
appreciation
of
what
he
had
done
to
save
the
waterfront
a
thousand
dollar
purse
had
been
raised
gandiss
whose
factory
certainly
would
have
faced
destruction
had
wharves
caught
fire
had
contributed
half
the
sum
himself
why
beaching
the
was
nothing
the
captain
protested
deeply
embarrassed
i
can
repair
the
damage
done
to
the
with
less
than
a
hundred
dollars
the
money
is
yours
and
you
must
keep
it
he
was
told
you
must
have
a
use
for
it
i
have
that
captain
barker
admitted
winking
at
his
daughter
a
certain
young
lady
of
my
acquaintance
who
has
been
hankerin
to
go
away
to
college
oh
pop
sally
eyes
danced
how
wonderful
i
know
where
i
want
to
go
too
so

the
school

father

sally

her
head

for
penny

catalogue
she
laughed

good
luck

future
course
by
her
transcriber
notes
replaced
the
list
of
books
in
the
series
by
the
complete
list

handful
of
palpable
typos
