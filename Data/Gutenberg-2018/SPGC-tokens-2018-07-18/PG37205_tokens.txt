i
though
it
is
easier
and
perhaps
far
better
not
to
begin
at
all
yet
if
a
beginning
is
made
it
is
there
that
most
care
is
needed
everything
is
inherent
in
the
genesis
so
i
have
to
record
the
simple
genesis
of
this
affair
as
a
winter
morning
after
rain
there
was
more
rain
to
come
the
sky
was
waterlogged
and
the
grey
ceiling
overstrained
had
sagged
and
dropped
to
the
level
of
the
chimneys
if
one
of
them
had
pierced
it
the
danger
was
imminent
that
day
was
but
a
thin
solution
of
night
you
know
those
november
mornings
with
a
low
east
where
the
sunrise
should
be
as
though
the
day
were
looking
to
the
dayspring
there
is
what
we
have
waited
for
there
the
end
of
our
hope
prone
and
shrouded
this
morning
of
mine
was
such
a
morning
the
world
was
very
quiet
as
though
it
were
exhausted
after
tears
beneath
a
broken
the
rain
all
the
night
had
i
listened
to
its
monody
had
discovered
a
nest
of
pebbles
in
the
path
of
my
garden
in
a
london
suburb
it
occurs
to
you
at
once
that
a
london
garden
especially
in
winter
should
have
no
place
in
a
narrative
which
tells
of
the
sea
and
the
jungle
but
it
has
much
to
do
with
it
it
is
part
of
the
heredity
of
this
book
it
is
the
essence
of
this
adventure
of
mine
that
it
began
on
the
kind
of
day
which
so
commonly
occurs
for
both
of
us
in
the
year
s
assortment
of
days
my
garden
on
such
a
morning
is
a
necessary
feature
of
the
narrative
and
much
as
i
should
like
to
skip
it
and
get
to
sea
yet
things
must
be
taken
in
the
proper
order
and
the
garden
comes
first
there
it
was
the
blackened
dahlias
the
last
to
fall
prone
in
the
field
where
death
had
got
all
things
under
his
feet
my
pleasaunce
was
a
dark
area
of
soddened
relics
the
battalions
of
june
were
slain
and
their
bodies
in
the
mud
that
was
the
prospect
in
life
i
had
how
was
i
to
know
the
skipper
had
returned
from
the
tropics
standing
in
the
central
mud
which
also
was
black
surveying
that
forlorn
end
to
devoted
human
effort
what
was
there
to
tell
me
the
skipper
had
brought
back
his
tramp
steamer
from
the
lands
under
the
sun
i
knew
of
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
december
with
january
to
follow
what
should
you
and
i
expect
after
november
but
the
next
month
of
winter
should
the
cultivators
of
london
backs
look
for
adventures
even
though
they
have
read
old
hakluyt
what
are
the
americas
to
us
the
amazon
and
the
orinoco
barbados
and
panama
and
port
royal
but
tales
that
are
told
we
have
never
been
nearer
to
them
and
now
know
we
shall
never
be
nearer
to
them
than
that
hill
in
our
neighbourhood
which
gives
us
a
broad
prospect
of
the
sunset
there
is
as
near
as
we
can
approach
thither
we
go
and
ascend
of
an
evening
like
moses
except
for
our
pipe
it
is
all
the
escape
vouchsafed
us
did
we
ever
know
the
chain
to
give
the
chain
has
a
certain
know
it
to
a
that
ultimate
link
the
possibilities
of
which
we
never
strain
the
mean
range
of
our
chain
the
office
and
the
polling
booth
what
a
radius
yet
it
can
not
prevent
us
ascending
that
hill
which
looks
with
uplifted
and
shining
brow
to
the
far
vague
country
whence
comes
the
last
of
the
light
at
dayfall
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
learn
that
on
my
way
to
catch
the
that
is
always
the
came
to
me
no
premonition
of
change
no
portent
was
in
the
sky
but
the
grey
wrack
i
saw
the
hale
and
dominant
gentleman
as
usual
who
arrives
at
the
station
in
a
brougham
drawn
by
two
grey
horses
he
looked
as
proud
and
arrogant
as
ever
for
his
face
is
as
a
bull
s
he
had
the
usual
bunch
of
scarlet
geraniums
in
his
coat
and
the
stationmaster
assisted
him
into
an
apartment
and
his
footman
handed
him
a
rug
a
routine
as
stable
as
the
hills
this
if
only
the
solemn
footman
would
one
morning
as
solemnly
as
ever
hurl
that
rug
at
his
master
with
the
umbrella
to
crash
after
it
one
could
begin
to
hope
then
there
was
the
pale
girl
in
black
who
never
between
our
suburb
and
the
city
lifts
her
shy
brown
eyes
benedictory
as
they
are
at
such
a
time
from
the
soiled
book
of
the
local
public
library
and
whose
umbrella
has
lost
half
its
handle
a
china
nob
i
think
i
will
write
this
book
for
her
and
there
were
all
the
others
who
catch
that
train
except
the
young
fellow
with
the
cough
now
and
then
he
does
miss
it
using
for
the
purpose
i
have
no
doubt
that
only
form
of
rebellion
against
its
accursed
tyranny
which
we
have
yet
learned
physical
inability
to
catch
it
where
that
morning
train
starts
from
is
a
mystery
but
it
never
fails
to
come
for
us
and
it
never
takes
us
beyond
the
city
i
well
know
i
have
a
clear
memory
of
the
newspapers
as
they
were
that
morning
i
had
a
sheaf
of
them
for
it
is
my
melancholy
business
to
know
what
each
is
saying
i
learned
there
were
dark
and
portentous
matters
not
actually
with
us
but
looming
each
already
rather
larger
than
a
man
s
hand
if
certain
things
happened
said
one
half
the
papers
ruin
stared
us
in
the
face
if
those
thing
did
not
happen
said
the
other
half
ruin
stared
us
in
the
face
no
way
appeared
out
of
it
you
paid
your
and
were
damned
either
way
if
you
paid
a
penny
you
got
more
for
your
money
boding
gloom
could
be
had
for
that
there
was
your
extra
value
for
you
i
looked
round
at
my
fellow
passengers
all
reading
the
same
papers
and
all
it
could
be
reasonably
presumed
with
of
catastrophe
they
were
indifferent
every
one
of
them
i
suppose
we
have
learned
with
some
bitterness
that
nothing
ever
happens
but
private
failure
and
tragedy
unregarded
by
our
fellows
except
with
pity
the
blare
of
the
political
megaphones
and
the
sustained
panic
of
the
party
have
a
message
for
us
we
may
suppose
we
may
be
sure
the
noise
means
something
so
does
the
butcher
s
boy
when
the
sheep
want
to
go
up
a
side
turning
he
makes
a
noise
he
means
something
with
his
warning
cries
the
driving
uproar
has
a
purpose
but
we
have
found
out
not
they
who
would
break
up
side
turnings
but
the
people
in
the
second
class
carriages
of
the
morning
train
that
now
though
our
first
instinct
is
to
start
in
a
panic
when
we
hear
another
sudden
warning
shout
there
is
no
need
to
do
so
and
perhaps
having
attained
to
that
more
callous
mind
which
allows
us
to
stare
dully
from
the
carriage
window
though
with
that
urgent
din
in
our
ears
a
reasonable
explanation
of
the
increasing
excitement
and
flushed
anxiety
of
the
great
statesmen
and
their
fuglemen
may
occur
to
us
in
a
generation
or
two
give
us
time
but
how
they
wish
they
were
out
of
it
they
who
need
no
more
time
but
understand
i
put
down
the
papers
with
their
calls
to
social
righteousness
pitched
in
the
upper
register
of
the
their
bright
and
instructive
interviews
with
flat
earthers
and
with
the
veteran
who
is
topically
interesting
because
having
served
one
master
fifty
years
and
reared
thirteen
children
on
fifteen
shillings
a
week
he
has
just
begun
to
draw
his
old
age
pension
there
s
industry
thrift
and
success
my
little
dears
one
paper
had
a
column
account
of
the
youngest
child
actress
in
london
her
toys
and
her
philosophy
initialed
by
one
of
our
younger
brilliant
journalists
all
had
a
society
divorce
case
with
sanitary
elisions
another
contained
an
amusing
account
of
a
man
working
his
way
round
the
world
with
a
barrel
on
his
head
again
the
young
prince
we
were
credibly
informed
in
all
the
papers
of
that
morning
did
stop
to
look
in
at
a
window
in
regent
street
the
previous
afternoon
so
like
a
boy
you
know
and
yet
he
is
a
prince
of
course
the
matter
could
not
be
doubted
the
report
was
carefully
illustrated
the
prince
stood
on
his
feet
outside
the
toy
shop
and
looked
in
to
think
of
the
future
as
a
modestly
long
series
of
such
prone
mornings
dawns
unlit
by
heaven
s
light
new
days
to
which
we
should
be
awakened
always
by
these
clamant
cockcrows
bringing
to
our
notice
what
the
of
our
fellows
had
accomplished
in
nests
of
intelligent
and
fruitful
china
eggs
was
enough
to
make
one
stand
up
in
the
carriage
horrified
and
pull
the
communication
cord
so
i
put
down
the
papers
and
turned
to
the
landscape
had
i
known
the
skipper
was
back
from
below
the
i
did
not
know
so
i
must
go
on
to
explain
that
that
morning
train
did
stop
with
its
unfailing
regularity
and
not
the
least
hint
of
reprieve
at
the
place
appointed
in
the
schedule
soon
i
was
at
work
showing
i
hope
the
right
eager
and
concentrated
eye
dutifully
and
busily
climbing
the
revolving
wheel
like
the
squirrel
except
unluckier
than
that
wild
thing
so
far
as
i
know
i
was
clearly
conscious
whatever
the
speed
the
wheel
remained
forever
in
the
same
place
looking
up
to
sigh
through
the
bars
after
a
long
spin
there
was
the
skipper
smiling
at
me
i
saw
an
open
door
i
got
out
it
was
as
though
the
world
had
been
suddenly
lighted
and
i
could
see
a
great
distance
we
stood
in
fleet
street
later
interrupting
the
tide
the
noise
of
the
traffic
came
to
me
from
afar
for
the
sailor
was
telling
me
he
was
sailing
soon
and
that
he
was
taking
his
vessel
an
experimental
voyage
through
the
tropical
forests
of
the
amazon
he
was
going
to
para
and
thence
up
the
main
stream
as
far
as
manaos
and
would
then
attempt
to
reach
a
point
on
the
madeira
river
near
bolivia
miles
above
its
junction
with
the
greater
river
it
would
be
a
noble
journey
they
would
see
obydos
and
santarem
and
the
foliage
would
brush
their
rigging
at
times
so
narrow
would
be
the
way
and
where
they
anchored
at
night
the
jaguars
would
come
to
drink
this
to
me
and
i
have
read
humboldt
and
bates
and
spruce
and
wallace
as
i
listened
my
pipe
went
out
it
was
when
we
were
parting
that
the
sailor
who
is
used
to
far
horizons
and
habitually
deals
with
affairs
in
a
large
way
because
his
standards
in
his
own
business
are
the
skyline
and
the
meridian
put
to
me
the
most
searching
question
i
have
had
to
answer
since
the
city
first
caught
and
caged
me
he
put
it
casually
when
he
was
striking
a
match
for
a
cigar
so
little
did
he
himself
think
of
it
then
why
said
he
don
t
you
chuck
it
what
escape
i
had
never
thought
of
that
it
is
the
last
solution
which
would
have
occurred
to
me
concerning
the
problem
of
captivity
it
is
a
credit
to
you
and
to
me
that
we
do
not
think
of
our
chains
so
disrespectfully
as
to
regard
them
as
anything
but
necessary
and
indispensable
though
sometimes
sore
and
irritated
we
may
bite
at
them
as
if
servitude
fell
to
our
portion
like
squints
parents
poor
in
spirit
green
fly
reverence
for
our
social
superiors
and
the
other
consignments
from
the
stars
how
should
we
live
if
not
in
bonds
i
have
never
tried
i
do
not
remember
in
all
the
even
and
respectable
history
of
my
family
that
it
has
ever
been
tried
the
habit
of
obedience
like
our
family
habit
of
noses
is
bred
in
the
bone
the
most
we
have
ever
done
is
to
shake
our
fists
at
destiny
and
i
have
done
most
of
that
give
it
up
said
the
skipper
and
come
with
with
a
sad
smile
i
lifted
my
foot
heavily
and
showed
him
what
had
me
round
the
ankle
poo
he
said
you
could
berth
with
the
second
mate
there
s
room
there
i
could
sign
you
on
as
purser
you
i
stared
at
him
the
fellow
meant
it
i
laughed
at
him
what
i
asked
conclusively
shall
i
do
about
all
this
i
waved
my
arm
round
fleet
street
source
of
all
the
light
i
know
giver
of
my
gift
of
income
tax
limit
of
my
perspective
how
should
i
live
when
withdrawn
from
the
smell
of
its
ink
the
urge
of
its
machinery
he
said
oh
damn
that
it
was
his
light
tone
which
staggered
me
and
not
what
he
said
the
sailor
s
manner
was
that
of
one
who
would
be
annoyed
if
i
treated
him
like
a
practical
man
arranging
miles
of
petty
considerations
and
exceptions
before
him
arguing
for
hours
along
rows
of
trifles
and
hoping
the
harvest
of
difficulties
of
no
consequence
at
the
end
of
the
argument
would
convince
him
indeed
i
know
he
is
always
impatient
for
the
next
step
in
any
business
and
not
like
most
of
us
for
more
careful
consideration
look
there
said
the
sailor
pointing
to
ludgate
circus
see
that
putney
bus
if
it
takes
up
two
more
passengers
before
it
passes
this
spot
then
you
ve
got
to
that
made
the
difficulty
much
clearer
i
agreed
the
bus
struggled
off
and
a
man
with
a
bag
ran
at
it
and
boarded
it
one
then
it
had
a
clear
almost
reached
another
two
seconds
began
to
breathe
more
easily
the
danger
of
liberty
was
almost
gone
then
the
sailor
jumped
for
the
bus
before
it
was
quite
level
and
as
he
mounted
the
steps
turned
and
held
up
two
fingers
with
a
grin
thus
was
a
voyage
of
great
moment
and
adventure
settled
for
me
when
i
got
home
that
night
i
referred
to
the
authorities
for
the
way
to
begin
an
enterprise
on
the
deep
what
said
hakluyt
according
to
him
it
is
as
easy
as
this
master
john
hawkins
with
the
jesus
of
lubeck
a
ship
of
tunnes
and
the
solomon
a
ship
of
seven
score
the
tiger
a
barke
of
and
the
swalow
of
tunnes
being
all
well
furnished
with
men
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
threescore
and
ten
as
also
with
ordnance
and
vituall
requisite
for
such
a
voyage
departed
out
of
plinmouth
the
day
of
october
in
the
yeere
of
our
lord
with
a
prosperous
but
we
all
know
such
things
were
done
far
better
in
that
century
yet
master
john
hawkins
who
seems
to
have
handled
a
fleet
with
greater
facility
than
i
do
this
pen
now
i
am
so
anxious
to
scratch
it
across
preliminaries
and
get
it
to
sea
did
not
come
to
a
decision
by
the
number
of
passengers
on
a
putney
bus
so
i
turned
to
a
modern
authority
yet
bates
i
found
is
worse
than
old
john
hawkins
bates
actually
arrives
at
his
destination
in
the
first
sentence
he
steps
across
in
words
from
england
to
the
amazon
i
embarked
at
liverpool
with
wallace
in
a
small
trading
vessel
on
the
day
of
april
and
after
a
swift
passage
from
the
irish
channel
to
the
equator
arrived
on
the
of
may
off
well
i
did
not
i
say
it
is
a
gross
deception
voyaging
does
not
get
accomplished
in
that
fashion
it
is
a
mockery
to
captives
like
ourselves
to
pretend
bondage
is
puffed
away
in
that
airy
manner
it
is
not
so
easily
persuaded
to
disencumber
us
indeed
with
this
and
that
i
found
the
initial
step
in
the
pursuit
of
the
sunset
red
a
heavy
weight
and
hardly
suited
to
the
constitution
of
men
who
have
worked
into
a
deep
rut
but
that
high
resolution
and
a
faith
equal
to
belief
in
the
liquefaction
of
januarius
blood
are
needed
to
drop
the
protective
routine
of
years
to
sheer
off
the
dear
and
warm
entanglements
of
home
and
friendships
to
shut
the
front
door
one
bleak
winter
evening
when
the
house
smells
comfortable
and
secure
and
the
light
on
the
hearth
under
such
circumstances
is
ironic
in
its
bright
revelation
of
years
of
ease
and
stability
till
then
not
fully
appraised
and
so
depart
in
the
dusk
for
an
unknown
welsh
coaling
port
there
to
board
a
tramp
steamer
for
a
voyage
that
has
some
serious
doubts
about
it
though
its
landfall
shall
be
near
the
line
and
have
palms
in
it
the
door
slammed
i
noticed
in
a
chill
and
penetrating
minor
an
incident
of
travel
i
have
never
seen
recorded
now
do
i
come
at
last
o
liberty
my
loved
and
secret
divinity
your
passionate
pilgrim
is
here
late
though
still
young
and
eager
eyed
yet
with
his
coat
collar
upturned
for
the
present
allons
the
open
road
is
before
him
but
how
the
broad
and
empty
prospects
of
his
freedom
shudder
with
the
dire
sounds
and
cries
of
the
milk
churns
on
paddington
station
and
next
i
remember
black
was
i
think
about
three
a
calamitous
rain
and
a
welsh
railway
station
where
i
had
alighted
faint
with
a
famine
a
kit
bag
soon
to
increase
in
weight
and
drag
and
a
pair
of
numbed
feet
there
was
a
porter
who
bore
himself
as
though
it
were
the
last
day
and
he
knew
the
worst
a
dying
station
light
the
wind
and
rain
and
me
outside
was
the
dark
and
one
of
the
greatest
coaling
ports
in
the
world
as
i
could
not
see
the
coal
in
great
bulk
i
could
not
admire
it
the
railway
man
turned
out
the
light
conducted
me
politely
into
a
puddle
set
my
course
for
the
docks
in
uncharted
night
with
a
dexter
having
no
convictions
and
left
me
i
began
to
hate
the
land
of
the
wild
bard
in
which
i
found
myself
for
the
first
time
and
felt
a
savage
satisfaction
in
being
nearly
a
pure
blooded
london
saxon
and
as
i
surveyed
my
prospects
in
that
country
not
even
the
fact
that
i
had
a
grandparent
named
hughes
would
have
prevented
me
striking
wales
with
my
umbrella
for
it
is
only
a
cheap
one
but
i
had
left
it
in
the
train
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
any
more
than
it
did
to
you
when
you
got
this
book
to
learn
about
the
tropic
sea
and
the
jungle
that
the
open
road
where
the
chains
fall
from
us
would
include
swansea
high
street
four
hours
before
sunrise
in
a
steady
winter
downpour
but
there
i
discovered
that
trade
wind
seas
by
moonlight
flying
fish
indians
and
forests
and
palms
can
not
be
compelled
they
come
in
their
turn
they
are
mixed
with
litter
and
dead
stuff
like
prizes
in
a
bran
tub
going
down
the
drear
and
aqueous
street
it
was
clear
that
if
there
are
exalted
moments
in
travel
as
on
the
instant
when
we
discover
we
really
may
prepare
to
go
yet
exaltation
implies
the
undistinguished
flats
from
which
for
a
while
we
are
translated
this
is
a
travel
book
for
honest
men
i
am
still
on
the
flat
it
will
be
presently
my
chief
fear
was
that
my
waterproof
rattling
in
the
wind
would
alarm
silent
and
sleeping
swansea
i
found
a
policeman
standing
at
a
street
corner
holding
out
his
cape
to
help
away
the
rain
he
could
give
me
no
hope
he
knew
where
the
dock
was
but
the
way
thither
was
difficult
and
torturous
i
had
better
follow
the
tram
lines
and
ask
again
if
i
saw
anybody
therefore
the
tram
lines
i
followed
till
my
portable
estate
by
compound
interest
had
increased
to
untold
tons
but
the
empty
tram
way
went
on
for
ever
down
the
rows
of
frozen
and
desolate
lamps
so
that
i
surrendered
all
my
chances
of
the
seas
of
the
tropics
and
the
jungle
of
the
brazils
and
turned
aside
from
the
course
which
the
policeman
said
led
to
ships
and
the
deep
entered
the
dark
portico
of
a
shop
where
it
was
only
half
wet
and
lit
my
pipe
there
to
wait
for
the
shy
gods
to
turn
my
luck
hesitating
footsteps
fumbled
to
where
i
was
hidden
and
stopped
at
the
flash
of
my
match
could
yer
blige
with
a
light
mister
he
was
a
little
elderly
seaman
in
yellow
oilskins
and
a
so
wester
he
was
rather
drunk
his
oilskins
gathered
the
reflected
street
shine
so
that
he
looked
phosphorescent
an
old
man
risen
wet
and
shining
from
the
ocean
he
was
looking
for
buenos
aires
he
explained
and
hadn
t
got
any
matches
now
he
for
the
plate
and
i
for
ultimate
amazonas
set
off
down
the
swansea
tram
lines
and
the
wind
whined
through
overhead
wires
and
a
lost
dog
followed
us
along
the
empty
thoroughfare
where
the
only
sound
was
of
waterspouts
and
the
elderly
mariner
sang
bold
and
improper
songs
so
that
i
wondered
there
was
not
an
irruption
of
nightcaps
at
upper
swansea
windows
to
witness
this
disturbance
of
their
usual
peace
we
came
at
length
to
abandoned
lagoons
where
spectral
ships
were
moored
down
the
marges
and
round
the
wide
waters
was
the
loom
of
uncertain
monsters
and
buildings
railway
metals
waylaid
us
and
caught
us
by
the
feet
there
were
many
electric
moons
swaying
in
the
gale
and
they
spilled
showers
of
broken
light
which
melted
on
the
black
water
and
betrayed
to
us
our
loneliness
in
outer
night
the
call
of
a
vessel
s
syren
across
that
inhospitable
space
was
heard
by
us
as
the
prolonged
moan
of
the
lost
the
old
man
of
the
sea
took
me
under
a
stack
of
timber
to
light
his
pipe
he
borrowed
my
box
of
matches
and
malicious
spurts
of
wind
extinguished
each
match
steadily
as
mine
ancient
struck
them
it
was
now
he
threw
each
bit
of
dead
wood
down
without
irritation
as
though
it
were
the
fate
of
man
to
strike
lights
for
the
gods
to
douse
but
yet
was
he
uplifted
now
beyond
the
hurt
of
cosmic
mockery
the
matches
were
not
wasted
at
least
they
lighted
up
his
sorrowful
face
as
he
talked
to
me
i
would
not
have
had
him
any
the
less
drunk
for
it
but
softened
his
facial
integument
which
i
could
see
had
been
hardened
and
set
by
bitter
experience
masking
the
man
but
now
his
jaded
life
warmed
by
emotion
though
much
of
the
emotion
was
artificial
and
of
the
pewter
born
was
quick
in
his
face
again
and
made
him
a
human
responsive
to
his
kind
instead
of
a
sober
and
warped
shellback
with
a
sour
remembrance
of
his
hardships
and
of
the
futility
of
his
endurance
and
of
the
distance
away
of
his
masters
with
their
bowels
of
iron
he
had
seven
children
and
the
sea
was
a
weary
place
had
i
any
children
god
keep
them
if
i
had
he
was
a
troublesome
old
man
that
s
another
light
gone
but
he
had
just
left
his
kids
ah
to
hell
wi
the
wind
and
he
had
to
talk
to
someone
about
them
and
that
was
my
rotten
luck
said
he
we
got
to
the
fifth
child
and
i
heard
something
about
her
when
the
wind
reached
round
the
wood
stack
at
us
and
snatched
the
last
glim
so
it
was
in
the
dark
that
i
heard
about
the
other
two
and
the
wife
while
one
of
my
pockets
filled
with
rain
only
milly
he
said
was
at
work
and
what
was
four
pound
a
month
for
the
rest
and
he
was
sick
of
the
sea
and
chief
mates
and
did
i
think
a
chap
stood
for
a
better
time
when
he
died
if
he
kept
off
drink
and
did
his
bit
without
grousing
like
some
of
the
parson
fellers
said
then
he
indicated
my
ship
and
disappeared
in
the
dark
he
is
still
waiting
an
answer
to
his
last
question
which
i
have
saved
for
you
to
give
him
for
me
i
was
in
no
mood
to
discuss
whether
balm
is
to
be
got
in
gilead
when
we
come
to
the
place
but
stumbling
among
the
lumber
on
the
deserted
deck
of
the
capella
i
found
a
cabin
fell
into
it
and
remember
nothing
more
but
the
smell
of
hot
bread
eggs
and
bacon
and
coffee
which
visited
me
in
a
beautiful
dream
then
i
woke
to
the
reveille
of
a
tin
whistle
which
the
chief
engineer
was
playing
in
my
ear
and
it
was
daylight
the
jumble
of
recollections
of
the
night
before
were
but
dark
insanities
but
the
smell
of
that
aromatic
food
i
give
grace
did
not
pass
with
the
awakening
for
next
door
i
heard
lively
sizzling
in
the
galley
already
fleet
street
was
hull
down
if
you
are
used
only
to
the
methods
of
passenger
steamers
and
regular
routes
then
you
know
little
of
travel
you
are
but
carried
about
insistent
clocks
and
schedules
keep
that
way
and
the
upholstered
but
rigid
routine
is
a
soporific
you
never
see
the
hither
side
of
the
hedge
the
granite
countenance
of
fortune
her
eyes
filmed
like
frozen
pools
which
keeps
alert
and
bright
the
voyager
who
is
unprotected
from
her
unscheduled
and
unmoral
acts
except
by
his
own
ready
buckler
is
watched
for
you
by
others
you
are
never
surprised
into
fear
by
the
unlucky
position
of
the
planets
nor
moved
to
sing
laus
deo
when
now
and
then
the
stars
are
propitious
i
had
been
brought
hastily
to
the
capella
for
it
was
said
she
was
sailing
instantly
this
morning
i
learned
at
breakfast
that
nobody
knew
when
she
could
sail
our
steamer
sat
two
feet
higher
than
her
capacity
there
was
some
galvanised
iron
to
come
from
glascow
some
machinery
from
sheffield
and
owing
to
labour
difficulties
we
were
short
of
several
hundred
tons
of
coal
a
little
mob
of
us
all
strangers
shuffled
after
the
skipper
s
spry
heels
that
morning
to
the
board
of
trade
offices
where
an
official
mumbled
over
the
ship
s
articles
to
our
shut
ears
and
we
signed
where
we
were
told
a
more
glum
and
unromantic
group
of
voyagers
each
man
twirling
his
shabby
hat
in
his
hands
as
he
waited
his
turn
for
the
corroded
pen
was
never
seen
this
side
of
the
elizabethan
era
i
became
the
purser
of
the
capella
with
my
wages
lawfully
recorded
at
a
shilling
per
month
i
was
committed
there
was
no
withdrawal
now
but
desertion
and
desertion
at
times
i
seriously
considered
because
for
a
week
more
the
cargo
dribbled
down
to
us
while
i
endured
as
a
moucher
about
those
winter
docks
with
their
coal
tips
and
the
muddy
streets
with
their
sailors
slop
marts
marine
stores
and
pawnshops
having
a
cankered
display
of
chronometers
telescopes
and
other
flotsam
of
marine
failure
and
wreckage
daily
the
quays
and
the
dismal
waterside
ways
with
their
cheap
shops
were
still
more
depressed
by
additional
snow
mush
and
drives
of
sleet
and
it
was
no
warmth
for
this
idler
that
he
saw
the
tradesmen
because
of
the
season
putting
holly
among
their
oranges
and
wreathing
beer
bottles
with
chains
of
coloured
paper
the
iron
decks
and
cabins
of
my
new
home
were
as
chill
and
unfriendly
as
the
empty
grate
the
marble
tables
and
the
tin
advertisements
of
chemical
slops
of
a
temperance
hotel
am
i
plain
such
are
the
conditions
which
compass
the
wayward
traveller
this
is
what
chills
one
s
rapid
pulse
when
pursuing
at
last
the
rosy
visions
of
boyhood
the
deplorable
littoral
of
our
island
kingdom
is
part
of
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
and
should
help
you
in
coming
to
a
decision
when
next
you
see
a
friendless
and
bestial
sailorman
it
becomes
necessary
to
declare
that
we
shall
really
get
down
to
the
tropics
presently
have
the
courage
to
wait
like
the
crew
of
the
our
ship
did
sail
when
she
was
ready
it
was
the
afternoon
before
we
sailed
and
having
listened
long
enough
to
my
messmates
who
after
dinner
weighed
the
probabilities
of
malaria
yellow
fever
and
other
alien
disasters
into
our
coming
strange
voyage
that
i
went
into
the
town
to
take
my
last
look
round
a
book
shop
and
to
get
some
marine
soap
dungarees
and
things
here
was
i
at
last
with
my
heart
s
desire
on
the
very
next
day
i
should
sail
i
myself
and
no
other
hero
veritably
me
at
last
for
a
place
not
on
the
chart
because
the
place
we
should
find
at
the
journey
s
end
the
map
described
with
those
words
of
magic
forest
and
i
made
my
way
round
crates
and
barrels
on
that
untidy
deck
which
had
a
thick
mud
of
coal
dust
and
snow
to
the
ladder
overside
coal
dust
and
melting
snow
but
where
was
the
uplifted
heart
the
radiant
anticipation
as
of
one
to
whom
the
future
was
big
with
treasures
to
be
born
which
are
the
privilege
of
a
young
pilgrim
released
from
his
usual
obligations
to
pursue
far
horizons
in
the
spanish
main
while
his
envious
fellows
in
the
city
still
cast
ledgers
under
gas
lamps
here
was
another
swindle
of
the
romanticists
you
may
search
their
warm
and
golden
pages
in
vain
for
coal
tips
melting
ice
delays
and
steam
heaters
that
will
not
work
for
cold
cabins
down
they
go
here
though
these
gallant
affairs
i
thought
as
i
descended
the
wet
and
gritty
ladder
are
much
better
done
before
the
fire
at
home
in
your
slippers
for
the
large
scale
map
as
you
traverse
its
alluring
blank
areas
leaves
out
the
conditions
which
now
when
i
am
on
the
actual
business
precipitate
as
frozen
spicules
as
would
north
winds
my
warm
aerial
and
cloudy
enthusiasms
that
were
wont
to
be
dyed
such
wonderful
hues
by
sunsets
poems
and
tales
of
old
travel
another
of
these
congealing
draughts
was
now
to
catch
me
unbuttoned
because
of
our
unusual
destination
and
the
wild
stories
that
were
told
of
it
we
were
a
point
of
interest
in
swansea
docks
and
had
many
interviewers
and
curious
visitors
some
of
them
were
on
the
quay
then
inspecting
our
steamer
and
as
i
stepped
off
the
ladder
one
turned
to
me
mister
he
whispered
are
you
going
in
her
i
am
i
said
o
gord
said
he
that
night
i
met
a
number
of
my
grave
fellow
shipmates
in
the
town
the
question
was
should
we
then
go
back
to
the
ship
what
burst
out
one
of
us
in
cap
was
already
resting
on
his
right
now
not
me
boys
don
t
freeze
the
carnival
follow
me
we
followed
him
the
rest
of
the
evening
is
more
easily
given
in
dumb
show
there
was
a
mechanical
piano
in
a
saloon
bar
and
it
steadily
devoured
pennies
and
returned
to
us
automatic
joy
fortissimo
over
which
our
conversation
strenuously
and
vaulted
later
there
was
a
search
for
cabs
and
an
engineer
carried
with
him
everywhere
two
geese
by
their
necks
and
sometimes
trod
on
their
loose
feet
when
he
did
this
he
snatched
a
goose
from
his
own
grasp
and
then
roundly
abused
us
for
our
frivolity
we
learned
our
steamer
was
now
moored
in
we
found
a
quay
wall
and
at
the
bottom
of
it
at
a
great
depth
in
the
dark
the
level
of
the
water
was
seen
only
because
shreds
of
floated
there
we
understood
a
boat
was
below
and
found
it
was
and
we
loaded
it
till
the
water
brimmed
at
the
gunwale
as
we
mounted
the
capella
s
only
one
goose
fell
back
into
the
dock
the
capella
started
in
her
sleep
and
she
woke
me
she
was
still
trembling
resting
my
hand
on
her
i
felt
her
heart
begin
to
throb
though
faintly
we
were
off
it
was
a
bright
morning
early
and
keen
those
habitual
quays
now
were
moving
past
us
the
decks
were
cleared
the
carpenter
and
some
sailors
were
fixing
the
hatches
and
the
pilot
muffled
in
a
thick
white
shawl
was
on
the
bridge
with
the
skipper
we
stopped
in
the
outer
lock
the
exhaust
humming
impatiently
while
a
we
were
a
sailor
examined
by
our
doctor
the
skipper
had
some
short
words
for
an
official
who
had
mounted
the
bridge
because
the
third
mate
had
deserted
and
had
taken
his
half
pay
and
the
official
who
had
volunteered
to
get
us
a
substitute
had
failed
there
were
now
but
two
mates
for
our
big
tramp
steamer
going
a
long
and
arduous
voyage
which
included
the
navigation
for
some
months
of
narrow
inland
waterways
in
the
tropics
our
first
mate
passing
amidships
where
the
purser
was
leaning
overside
stopped
to
tell
me
what
this
meant
for
him
and
the
second
mate
i
was
mighty
glad
it
was
not
the
purser
s
fault
i
have
never
heard
a
short
speech
more
passionate
and
his
eyes
were
feral
yet
it
became
increasingly
clear
to
me
as
the
voyage
lengthened
that
his
eyes
no
more
than
met
the
case
out
we
drove
at
last
it
was
december
but
by
luck
we
found
a
halcyon
morning
which
had
got
lost
in
the
year
s
procession
it
was
a
sunday
morning
and
it
had
not
been
ashore
it
was
still
virgin
bearing
a
vestal
light
it
had
not
been
soiled
yet
by
any
suspicion
of
this
trampled
planet
this
muddy
star
which
its
innocent
and
tenuous
rays
had
discovered
in
the
region
of
night
i
thought
it
still
was
regarding
us
as
a
lucky
find
there
its
light
was
tremulous
as
if
with
joy
and
eagerness
i
met
this
discovering
morning
as
your
ambassador
while
you
still
slept
and
betrayed
not
i
hope
any
greyness
and
bleared
satiety
of
ours
to
its
pure
frail
and
lucid
regard
that
was
the
last
good
service
i
did
before
leaving
you
quite
i
was
glad
to
see
how
well
our
old
earth
did
meet
such
a
light
as
though
it
had
no
difficulty
in
looking
day
in
the
face
the
world
was
miraculously
renewed
it
rose
and
received
the
of
aurora
in
its
arms
there
was
clouds
of
pearl
above
hills
of
chrysoprase
the
sea
ran
in
volatile
flames
the
shadows
on
the
bright
deck
shot
to
and
fro
as
we
rolled
the
breakfast
bell
rang
not
too
soon
this
was
a
right
beginning
the
pilot
was
dropped
and
a
course
was
shaped
to
pass
between
lundy
and
hartland
a
strong
northwester
and
its
seas
caught
us
beyond
the
mumbles
and
the
quality
of
the
sunshine
thinned
to
a
flickering
stuff
which
cast
only
grey
shadows
the
capella
became
quarrelsome
and
began
to
strike
the
seas
heavily
you
may
know
the
capella
when
you
see
her
she
is
a
modern
freighter
with
derrick
supports
fore
and
aft
and
a
funnel
and
the
three
of
them
are
so
fearful
of
seeming
rakish
that
they
overdo
the
effect
of
stern
utility
and
appear
to
lean
ahead
she
is
a
ship
the
amidships
section
carrying
the
second
mate
s
cabin
and
the
cabins
of
the
four
engineers
all
of
them
excepting
the
chief
s
cabin
looking
outwards
overseas
across
a
narrow
sheltered
alleyway
and
on
a
narrower
athwartship
s
alleyway
there
and
opening
astern
are
the
chief
s
place
and
the
cook
s
galley
the
entrance
to
the
and
the
engineers
messroom
above
this
structure
is
the
boat
deck
you
may
reach
the
poop
which
contains
the
master
s
and
chief
mate
s
quarters
the
doctor
s
and
steward
s
berths
and
the
saloon
by
descending
a
perpendicular
iron
ladder
to
the
long
main
deck
or
else
as
all
did
at
sea
by
a
flying
trestle
bridge
which
is
dismantled
when
in
port
her
black
funnel
is
relieved
by
a
cryptic
design
in
white
and
her
bows
are
so
bluff
that
as
the
chief
mate
put
it
her
belly
begins
she
might
not
take
your
eye
but
a
shipowner
would
see
her
points
she
carries
a
large
cargo
on
a
comparatively
low
registered
tonnage
the
money
that
built
her
went
mostly
in
hull
and
engines
and
the
latter
do
their
work
as
sweetly
as
an
clock
giving
ten
and
a
half
knots
weather
permitting
on
a
low
coal
consumption
there
was
not
much
money
left
therefore
for
balm
in
the
cabins
and
that
is
the
reason
we
do
not
find
it
there
at
sundown
the
sky
cleared
the
wind
increased
in
violence
had
swept
it
of
the
last
feather
lundy
was
over
our
starboard
bow
a
small
dark
blot
in
a
clear
yellow
light
which
poured
with
the
gale
and
the
rising
seas
from
the
west
the
glass
was
falling
now
the
skipper
has
often
told
me
how
his
capella
had
faced
hurricanes
off
cape
hatteras
when
laden
with
ore
and
had
kept
her
decks
dry
there
are
other
stories
about
her
surprising
buoyancy
when
deeply
laden
and
i
have
heard
them
all
at
home
and
they
are
fine
stories
but
what
lies
they
are
for
there
below
me
with
lundy
not
even
passed
and
the
bay
of
biscay
to
come
para
not
to
be
thought
of
yet
were
tons
and
tons
of
salt
wash
that
could
not
get
time
to
escape
by
the
scuppers
but
plunged
wearily
amongst
the
hatches
and
winches
i
ve
never
seen
her
as
dirty
as
this
grumbled
the
chief
engineer
apologetically
peeping
from
his
cabin
at
cold
green
water
lopping
over
casually
on
to
the
after
deck
it
s
that
patent
stowed
wrong
now
she
ll
can
feel
cat
she
is
she
s
never
going
to
stop
it
s
that
patent
fuel
and
her
new
load
certainly
she
sat
close
to
the
sea
i
had
never
seen
so
much
lively
water
so
close
she
wallowed
she
plunged
she
rolled
she
sank
heavily
to
its
level
i
looked
out
from
the
round
window
of
the
chief
s
cabin
and
when
she
inclined
those
green
mounds
of
the
swell
swinging
under
us
and
away
were
superior
in
apparition
to
my
outlook
listen
to
it
said
the
chief
he
stopped
triturating
some
shavings
of
hard
tobacco
between
his
huge
palms
and
sat
quietly
hands
clasped
as
though
in
prayer
the
surge
mourned
over
the
deck
the
day
too
was
growing
towards
the
dusky
hours
of
retrospection
that
sombre
monody
outside
was
like
the
tremor
and
boom
of
the
drums
funebre
that
chap
some
of
you
talk
george
the
chief
suddenly
rubbing
his
tobacco
again
with
energy
good
god
i
thought
and
here
we
are
at
sea
too
now
what
has
the
misguided
man
done
if
i
had
him
here
i
d
hold
him
down
in
that
wash
on
deck
till
it
cleared
then
he
d
know
he
put
it
there
to
break
sailors
legs
this
steamer
she
had
dry
decks
till
her
load
line
was
altered
she
carries
more
now
than
she
was
built
for
two
hundred
tons
more
if
i
had
him
there
you
are
popularity
there
s
a
fine
popular
noise
for
you
isn
t
it
sailors
growled
for
better
food
what
about
this
improved
food
scale
says
lloyd
george
to
the
shipowners
oh
said
they
we
ll
give
em
better
food
the
drunken
insubordinate
dogs
if
you
ll
make
overloading
why
says
lord
george
then
it
wouldn
t
be
illegal
would
it
so
it
was
done
what
does
the
public
know
about
a
ship
s
buoyancy
nothing
but
it
understands
food
so
the
clever
man
heightens
the
plimsoll
mark
adds
a
million
or
so
to
shipowners
capital
by
dipping
his
pen
in
the
ink
and
gives
jack
more
jam
what
you
want
ashore
the
chief
added
bitterly
is
not
more
voters
as
some
say
but
more
lunatic
though
i
had
left
politics
at
home
to
be
settled
by
others
like
the
trouble
with
the
drains
the
dog
licence
and
the
dispute
about
the
garden
fence
i
glanced
with
interest
at
the
chief
i
know
him
well
not
only
is
he
a
kindly
man
but
he
himself
is
also
a
philosophic
rebel
but
his
eye
was
hard
and
he
still
ground
the
tobacco
with
forgetful
energy
us
though
an
objectionable
thing
were
between
his
strong
hands
then
impatiently
he
threw
the
tobacco
loose
on
his
log
book
which
was
open
on
his
deck
paused
and
said
ah
maybe
the
man
thought
a
little
freeboard
the
less
didn
t
matter
god
give
him
grace
and
picked
his
flute
out
of
a
bookshelf
which
was
fastened
above
his
bunk
sat
down
over
the
steam
heater
and
broke
out
like
a
blackbird
yet
was
it
a
air
he
fluted
so
well
i
listened
so
long
as
respect
for
the
artist
demanded
then
rose
filled
my
pipe
from
the
fragrant
grains
on
the
log
book
and
left
him
presently
i
would
listen
to
such
airs
but
this
was
too
soon
i
repeat
i
had
confidence
in
the
capella
to
gain
i
went
forward
to
get
it
mounting
the
bridge
where
my
cabin
mate
the
youthful
second
officer
was
in
charge
in
his
oilskins
a
cheerful
sight
he
looked
i
think
said
he
briskly
we
re
going
to
catch
he
was
puckering
his
face
over
our
course
lundy
was
looming
rat
island
was
it
looked
so
frail
in
that
flood
of
seas
wind
and
wild
yellow
light
streaming
together
from
the
evening
west
that
i
looked
for
the
unsubstantial
island
to
spring
suddenly
from
its
foundations
and
to
come
down
on
us
a
stretched
wisp
of
thinned
and
ragged
smoke
the
sea
was
adrift
from
its
old
confines
the
flood
was
pouring
past
and
the
wind
was
the
drainage
of
interstellar
space
lundy
was
the
last
delicate
fragment
of
land
it
still
fronted
the
upheaval
and
rush
of
the
ungoverned
elements
but
one
looked
for
it
to
be
swept
away
yet
that
wild
and
scenic
west
of
such
pallor
and
clarity
that
one
shrank
from
facing
its
inhospitable
spaciousness
with
each
shape
of
a
wave
there
black
against
the
light
as
it
reared
ahead
a
distinct
individual
foe
in
the
host
moving
to
the
attack
was
but
the
prelude
night
and
the
worst
were
to
come
just
then
while
the
last
of
the
light
was
shining
on
the
officer
s
oilskins
i
was
only
surprised
that
our
bulk
was
such
a
trifle
after
all
our
loaded
vessel
looked
so
bluff
and
massive
when
in
dock
she
began
to
attempt
off
lundy
the
spring
and
jauntiness
of
a
trawler
the
bows
sank
to
the
rails
in
an
acre
of
white
and
the
spume
flew
past
the
bridge
like
rain
the
black
bows
lifted
and
swayed
buoyant
on
submarine
upheavals
to
cut
out
segments
of
the
sunset
then
sank
again
into
dark
hollows
where
the
foam
was
luminous
the
cold
and
wind
were
bitter
dolours
we
rolled
i
grasped
the
rail
of
the
weather
cloth
in
the
drive
of
wind
and
spume
and
rode
down
on
our
charger
like
a
valiant
man
like
a
valiant
man
who
is
uncertain
of
his
seat
something
like
a
valiant
man
we
advanced
to
the
attack
masts
and
funnel
describing
great
arcs
and
steadily
our
bows
shouldered
away
the
foe
i
think
sailors
deserve
large
monies
being
the
less
the
longer
i
watched
the
more
grew
i
wet
and
came
to
my
mind
that
where
we
were
but
a
few
weeks
before
another
large
freighter
had
her
hatches
opened
by
the
seas
and
presently
was
but
a
trace
of
oil
and
cinders
on
the
waters
you
will
remember
i
am
on
my
first
long
voyage
the
officer
was
quite
cheerful
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
forest
gate
there
were
he
said
some
fine
girls
at
forest
gate
we
rounded
hartland
it
was
dusk
the
weather
was
now
directly
on
our
starboard
beam
and
the
waves
were
coming
solidly
inboard
the
main
deck
was
white
with
plunging
water
we
rolled
still
more
i
can
t
make
out
why
you
left
london
when
you
didn
t
have
to
said
the
grinning
sailor
i
d
like
to
be
on
the
stratford
tram
going
down
to
forest
this
was
nearly
as
bad
as
the
chief
s
flute
i
held
up
two
fingers
over
those
hatches
of
ours
called
silently
on
blessed
saint
anthony
who
loves
sailors
and
went
down
the
ladder
for
night
had
come
and
the
prospect
from
the
capella
was
not
the
less
apprehensive
to
the
mind
of
a
landsman
because
the
enemy
could
not
be
seen
except
as
flying
ghosts
the
noises
could
be
heard
all
right
i
shut
my
heavy
teak
door
amidships
shut
out
the
daunting
uproar
of
floods
and
the
sensation
that
the
night
was
collapsing
round
our
heaving
ship
there
was
a
home
light
far
away
on
some
unseen
cornish
headland
rising
and
falling
like
a
soaring
but
tethered
star
nor
did
i
want
the
lights
of
home
i
love
the
sea
a
beautiful
woman
once
said
to
me
we
then
stood
looking
out
over
it
from
a
height
and
the
sea
was
but
the
sediment
of
the
still
air
the
blue
precipitation
of
the
sky
for
it
was
that
restful
time
early
october
i
also
loved
it
then
i
was
thinking
of
this
when
the
concrete
floor
of
the
cabin
nearly
became
a
wall
and
i
fell
striking
nearly
every
item
in
the
cabin
was
this
the
way
to
greet
a
lover
sitting
on
a
and
swaying
to
and
fro
because
the
ship
compelled
me
to
a
figure
of
woe
i
began
to
consider
whether
it
was
only
the
books
about
the
sea
which
i
had
loved
hitherto
and
not
the
sea
itself
perhaps
it
is
better
not
to
live
with
it
if
you
would
love
it
the
sea
is
at
its
best
at
london
near
midnight
when
you
are
within
the
arms
of
a
capacious
chair
before
a
glowing
fire
selecting
phases
of
the
voyages
you
will
never
make
it
is
wiser
not
to
try
to
realise
your
dreams
there
are
no
real
dreams
for
as
to
the
sea
itself
love
it
you
can
not
why
should
you
i
will
never
believe
again
the
sea
was
ever
loved
by
anyone
whose
life
was
married
to
it
it
is
the
creation
of
omnipotence
which
is
not
of
human
kind
and
understandable
and
so
the
springs
of
its
behaviour
are
hidden
the
sea
does
not
assume
its
royal
blue
to
please
you
its
brute
and
dark
desolation
is
not
raised
to
overwhelm
you
you
disappear
then
because
you
happen
to
be
there
it
carries
the
lucky
foolish
to
fortune
and
drags
the
calculating
wise
to
the
strewn
bones
yet
thought
i
that
night
off
cornwall
if
i
pray
now
as
one
of
the
privileged
and
lucky
foolish
this
very
occasion
may
prove
to
be
set
apart
for
the
sole
use
of
the
calculating
wise
because
that
is
the
way
things
happen
at
sea
what
else
may
we
expect
from
it
the
nameless
thing
with
each
dawn
but
as
old
as
the
night
now
for
me
had
it
degenerated
into
its
mood
of
old
night
behaving
as
it
did
in
the
lightless
days
before
poetry
came
to
change
it
with
flattery
it
was
again
as
inhuman
as
when
the
poet
was
merely
a
wonderfully
potential
blob
on
a
warm
mudbank
here
you
see
is
the
whole
trouble
in
appealing
to
omnipotence
picture
me
entering
the
wide
western
ocean
at
night
an
inconspicuous
but
morsel
sitting
on
a
at
a
time
when
it
was
perhaps
ordained
that
hundreds
of
ships
should
have
anxious
passages
afterwards
i
learned
very
many
ships
did
have
anxious
passages
how
could
i
expect
to
be
spared
even
though
somewhere
the
hairs
of
my
head
were
all
numbered
it
is
plain
that
to
spare
me
would
be
to
extend
beneficence
to
all
there
only
remained
to
me
my
liberty
to
hope
that
our
particular
steamer
might
miss
all
seventh
waves
by
luck
i
was
free
to
do
that
i
turned
up
the
dull
and
stinking
oil
lamp
and
tried
to
read
but
that
fuliginous
glim
haunted
the
pages
that
light
too
much
resembled
my
own
thoughts
made
manifest
there
were
some
bunches
of
my
cabin
mate
s
clothes
hanging
from
hooks
and
i
watched
their
erratic
behaviour
instead
the
water
in
the
carafe
was
also
interesting
because
quite
mad
standing
diagonally
in
the
bottle
and
then
reversing
a
lump
of
soap
made
a
flying
leap
from
the
washstand
and
then
slithered
about
the
floor
like
something
hunted
and
i
listened
to
numerous
little
voices
there
was
no
telling
their
origins
there
was
a
chorus
in
the
cabin
rustlings
whispers
plaints
creaks
wails
and
grunts
but
they
were
foundered
in
the
din
when
the
spittoon
which
was
an
empty
meat
tin
got
its
lashings
loose
and
began
a
rioting
fandango
on
the
concrete
over
the
clothes
chest
which
was
also
our
table
and
a
cabin
fixture
was
a
portrait
of
the
mate
s
sweetheart
and
on
its
frame
was
one
of
my
busy
little
friends
the
cockroaches
for
the
mate
and
i
do
not
sleep
alone
in
this
cabin
not
by
hundreds
the
cockroach
stood
in
thought
waving
his
hands
interrogatively
as
one
who
talks
to
himself
nervously
the
ship
at
that
moment
received
a
seventh
wave
lurched
and
trembled
the
cockroach
fell
i
rose
listening
i
felt
sure
a
new
clamour
would
begin
at
once
showing
we
had
reached
another
and
critical
stage
of
the
fight
but
no
the
brave
heart
of
her
was
beating
as
before
i
could
feel
its
steady
pulse
throbbing
in
our
table
we
were
alive
and
strong
though
labouring
direfully
it
was
when
i
was
thinking
whether
bed
would
be
as
i
have
so
often
found
it
the
best
answer
to
doubt
that
i
heard
a
boatswain
s
pipe
i
fought
one
side
of
the
door
and
the
wind
fought
the
other
my
hurry
to
open
the
door
was
great
but
the
obstinate
wind
jammed
it
firmly
without
warning
the
wind
released
its
hold
the
ship
fell
over
to
windward
the
door
flew
open
and
forth
i
went
clutching
at
the
driving
dark
then
up
sailed
my
side
of
the
ship
and
the
door
shut
with
the
sound
of
gunfire
i
had
never
experienced
such
insensate
violence
these
were
the
unlawful
noises
and
movements
of
chaos
hanging
to
a
rail
i
was
puzzling
out
which
was
the
fore
and
which
the
rear
of
the
ship
when
a
flying
lump
of
salt
water
struck
me
in
the
face
just
as
a
figure
i
thought
it
was
the
chief
officer
hurried
past
me
bawling
all
the
figure
came
back
that
you
purser
number
three
hatch
has
gone
it
said
and
disappeared
instantly
so
then
this
very
thing
had
come
to
me
and
at
night
our
hatches
were
adrift
it
was
impossible
why
we
had
only
just
left
swansea
it
could
not
be
true
it
was
absurdly
unfair
this
was
my
first
long
voyage
and
it
had
only
just
begun
i
stood
like
the
cricketer
who
is
out
for
a
duck
if
i
could
tell
you
how
i
felt
i
would
somebody
was
shouting
somewhere
but
his
words
were
cut
off
at
once
by
the
wind
and
blown
away
i
felt
my
way
along
a
wet
and
dark
iron
alleyway
which
was
giddily
unstable
pressing
hard
against
my
feet
and
then
falling
from
under
me
i
got
round
by
the
entrance
small
gleams
shavings
of
light
were
escaping
from
seams
in
the
unseen
structure
but
they
showed
nothing
except
a
length
of
wet
rail
or
a
scrap
of
wet
deck
the
ship
itself
was
a
shade
manned
by
voices
i
could
not
see
that
anything
was
being
done
were
they
allowing
her
to
fill
up
like
an
open
barge
i
became
aware
my
surcharged
feelings
were
escaping
by
my
knees
which
kept
knocking
in
their
tremors
against
a
lower
rail
i
tried
to
stop
this
trembling
by
hardening
my
muscles
but
my
fearful
legs
had
their
own
way
yet
it
is
plain
there
was
nothing
to
fear
i
told
my
legs
so
had
we
not
but
that
day
left
swansea
besides
i
had
already
commenced
a
letter
which
was
to
be
posted
at
para
the
letter
would
have
to
be
posted
they
were
waiting
for
it
at
home
somewhere
below
me
a
heavy
mass
of
water
plunged
monstrously
and
became
a
faintly
luminous
cloud
over
all
the
main
deck
aft
actually
framing
the
rectangular
form
of
the
deck
in
the
night
it
was
unreasonable
i
was
not
really
one
of
the
crew
either
though
on
the
articles
i
was
there
by
chance
no
advantage
should
be
taken
of
that
a
torrent
poured
down
the
athwartships
alleyway
and
nearly
swept
me
from
my
feet
one
could
not
watch
what
was
happening
that
was
another
cruel
injustice
the
wind
and
sea
could
be
heard
and
the
ship
could
be
felt
but
how
could
i
be
expected
to
know
what
to
do
in
the
dark
in
such
circumstances
there
ought
to
be
a
light
this
should
have
happened
in
the
daytime
my
garrulous
knees
struck
the
lower
rail
violently
in
their
excitement
i
leaned
over
the
rail
shading
my
eyes
i
grew
savagely
indignant
with
something
having
no
name
and
no
shape
i
can
not
even
now
give
a
name
to
the
thing
that
angered
me
but
can
just
discern
in
the
twilight
which
shrouds
the
undiscovered
a
vast
calm
face
the
rock
of
which
no
human
emotion
can
move
with
eyes
that
stare
but
see
nothing
and
a
mouth
that
never
speaks
and
ears
from
which
assailing
cries
and
questions
fall
as
mournful
echoes
ironic
repetitions
this
flung
stone
falls
from
it
as
unavailing
as
your
prayers
but
we
shall
never
cease
to
pray
and
fling
stones
alternately
up
there
into
the
twilight
nevertheless
when
the
chief
with
his
hurricane
lamp
found
me
he
says
i
was
smiling
the
youth
who
was
our
second
mate
ran
up
and
stood
by
us
the
better
to
shout
to
the
deck
below
he
shouted
bending
over
the
rail
till
he
was
screaming
through
hoarseness
he
turned
to
us
abruptly
they
don
t
understand
a
word
i
say
he
cried
in
despair
there
isn
t
a
sailor
or
an
englishman
in
the
crowd
the
german
this
i
found
afterwards
was
nearly
true
these
men
had
been
signed
on
at
a
continental
port
it
was
really
our
dutch
cook
who
saved
us
that
night
it
was
the
cook
who
first
saw
the
hatch
covers
going
the
ship
s
head
had
been
put
to
the
seas
to
keep
the
decks
as
clear
as
possible
and
being
now
more
accustomed
to
the
gloom
i
could
make
out
the
men
below
busy
at
the
hatch
most
conspicuous
among
them
was
the
cook
who
had
taken
charge
there
and
he
with
three
languages
bludgeoned
into
surprising
activity
the
inexperienced
youngsters
who
were
learning
for
the
first
time
what
happens
to
a
ship
when
the
carpenter
s
chief
job
on
leaving
port
has
its
defects
discovered
by
exceptional
weather
they
were
wading
through
swirling
waters
as
they
worked
and
once
a
greater
wave
sprang
bodily
over
them
and
when
the
hatch
showed
through
the
foam
again
some
of
the
men
had
gone
as
though
dissolved
but
it
was
found
they
had
kept
the
right
side
of
the
bulwarks
and
the
elderly
carpenter
whose
leg
had
got
wedged
in
a
winch
was
the
only
one
damaged
if
you
ask
me
when
i
shall
be
pleased
to
allow
the
necessary
sun
to
rise
upon
this
narrative
to
give
it
a
little
warmth
then
i
must
tell
you
it
can
not
be
done
till
we
have
fastened
down
the
capella
s
number
two
hatch
at
least
that
hatch
has
gone
now
and
if
hatches
one
and
four
give
way
while
number
two
is
getting
attention
from
the
weary
soaked
and
frozen
crowd
which
has
just
had
an
hour
s
desperate
work
at
number
three
then
i
fear
the
sun
will
never
rise
on
this
narrative
how
bates
got
over
to
his
wonderful
blue
butterflies
in
those
forest
paths
under
a
tropical
sun
in
words
i
do
not
know
he
must
have
been
thinking
of
nothing
but
his
butterflies
i
can
not
do
it
with
the
seas
and
the
ship
keeping
my
mind
so
busy
luckily
the
other
hatches
kept
staunch
we
were
watertight
again
when
the
old
man
the
chief
the
doctor
and
the
purser
gathered
late
that
night
in
the
chief
s
cabin
to
see
what
it
was
he
had
secreted
in
his
cupboard
and
boasted
of
we
sat
where
we
could
being
comfortably
crowded
and
i
never
knew
tobacco
could
taste
like
that
i
felt
as
if
never
before
had
i
found
such
large
leisure
for
extracting
its
full
flavour
from
being
suddenly
confined
within
a
space
which
gave
me
a
short
outlook
of
a
few
hours
i
was
presently
released
into
the
open
again
and
of
what
might
remain
to
me
of
the
usual
gift
of
ample
years
i
had
all
that
time
to
smoke
in
never
did
a
pipe
taste
so
sweet
it
is
idle
for
good
and
serious
souls
to
think
me
graceless
here
with
this
talk
of
tobacco
immediately
after
such
a
release
let
me
tell
them
my
sacrificial
smoke
rose
up
straight
and
accepted
looking
through
the
smoke
i
saw
clearly
how
worthy
kind
and
lovable
were
the
faces
of
my
comrades
i
warmed
to
this
voyage
for
the
first
time
as
though
after
a
test
i
had
been
initiated
this
was
the
place
for
me
with
men
like
these
about
me
and
such
great
affairs
to
be
met
i
revelled
in
the
thought
of
our
valorous
bluff
insignificant
as
we
were
in
that
malign
desolation
sundered
from
our
kind
chief
said
the
old
man
it
was
my
department
that
time
none
of
your
old
engines
did
you
ve
got
a
good
cook
said
the
chief
i
saw
then
the
chief
remembering
something
turned
in
his
seat
to
the
picture
hanging
above
his
desk
of
a
smiling
and
handsome
matron
here
s
luck
old
girl
he
said
holding
up
his
glass
you
can
still
send
me
some
the
chief
in
case
of
an
emergency
slept
in
his
clothes
that
night
on
the
settee
and
i
climbed
into
his
bunk
what
a
comfortable
outline
the
man
had
as
he
lay
on
his
broad
back
mildly
snoring
there
was
a
tangle
of
tense
hair
over
a
square
copper
coloured
forehead
a
long
experience
of
such
nights
was
written
in
many
lines
on
that
brow
and
was
shown
in
that
indifferent
snoring
while
chaos
was
without
the
nose
sprang
out
of
the
big
face
like
an
ejaculation
and
beneath
it
was
a
moustache
clipped
short
to
show
the
red
of
the
upper
lip
the
jaw
was
powerful
but
its
curves
made
it
friendly
his
body
and
limbs
hid
the
settee
and
had
a
margin
over
i
quite
believed
what
i
had
been
told
of
his
successful
way
with
refractory
stokers
there
was
confidence
to
be
got
from
a
mere
look
at
that
slumbering
jovian
form
the
storm
assailed
its
hairy
and
fleshy
ears
in
vain
i
braced
my
knees
against
the
bulkhead
to
keep
myself
still
the
rolling
was
so
violent
and
went
to
sleep
waking
to
find
us
on
a
level
keel
and
was
deceived
into
thinking
the
parallel
lines
of
grey
and
gold
in
the
upper
air
seen
as
a
picture
framed
by
the
port
were
the
heights
about
a
harbour
into
which
we
had
run
for
shelter
but
it
was
only
cloudland
over
the
western
ocean
the
stillness
too
was
but
a
short
reprieve
the
wind
was
merely
making
a
detour
to
spring
at
us
from
another
quarter
the
sun
died
at
birth
the
wind
we
had
lost
we
found
again
as
a
gale
from
the
the
waters
quickly
increased
again
and
by
noon
the
saloon
was
light
and
giddy
with
the
racing
of
the
propeller
i
moved
about
like
an
infant
learning
to
walk
we
were
miles
from
the
mumbles
course
it
was
cold
and
i
was
still
looking
for
the
pleasures
of
travel
the
doctor
came
to
introduce
himself
like
a
good
man
and
tried
me
with
such
things
as
fevers
shaw
brazilian
entomology
the
evolution
of
sex
the
medical
profession
under
socialism
the
sea
and
the
poets
but
my
thoughts
were
in
retreat
with
the
black
dog
in
full
cry
it
was
too
cold
and
damp
to
talk
even
of
sex
when
my
oil
lamp
began
to
throw
its
rays
of
brown
smell
the
doctor
tired
of
the
effort
to
exalt
the
sour
dough
which
was
my
mind
left
me
it
was
night
o
the
sea
and
the
poets
by
next
morning
the
gale
now
from
the
like
the
seas
was
constantly
reinforced
with
squalls
of
hurricane
violence
the
chief
put
a
man
at
the
throttle
in
the
early
afternoon
the
waves
had
assumed
serious
proportions
they
soared
by
us
in
broad
sombre
ranges
with
hissing
white
ridges
an
inhospitable
and
subduing
sight
they
were
a
quite
different
tribe
of
waves
from
the
volatile
and
malicious
natives
of
the
bristol
channel
those
channel
waves
had
no
serried
ranks
in
the
attack
they
were
but
a
horde
of
undisciplined
savages
appearing
to
assault
without
design
or
plan
but
getting
at
us
as
they
could
depending
on
their
numbers
the
waves
in
the
channel
were
smaller
folk
but
more
athletic
and
very
noisy
they
appeared
to
detach
themselves
from
the
sea
and
to
leap
at
us
shouting
these
western
ocean
waves
had
a
different
character
they
were
the
sea
we
did
not
have
a
multitude
of
waves
in
sight
but
the
sea
floor
itself
might
have
been
undulating
the
ocean
was
profoundly
convulsed
our
outlook
was
confined
to
a
few
heights
and
hollows
and
the
moving
heights
were
swift
but
unhurried
and
stately
your
alarm
as
you
saw
a
greater
hill
appear
ahead
tower
and
bear
down
had
no
time
to
get
more
than
just
out
of
the
stage
of
surprise
and
wonder
when
the
capella
s
bows
were
pointing
skyward
on
a
long
of
water
the
broken
summit
of
which
was
too
quick
for
the
capella
bows
disappeared
in
a
white
explosion
a
volley
of
spray
as
hard
as
shot
raked
the
bridge
the
foredeck
filled
with
raging
water
and
the
wave
swept
along
our
run
dark
severe
and
immense
with
so
little
noise
too
with
but
a
faint
hissing
of
foam
as
in
a
deliberate
silence
the
capella
then
began
to
run
down
a
valley
the
engines
were
reduced
to
half
speed
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
drive
her
at
such
seas
our
wet
and
slippery
decks
were
bleak
windswept
and
deserted
the
mirror
of
water
on
the
iron
surfaces
constantly
renewed
reflected
and
flashed
the
wild
lights
in
the
sky
as
she
rolled
and
pitched
and
somehow
those
reflections
from
her
polish
made
the
steamer
seem
more
desolate
and
forlorn
not
a
man
showed
anywhere
on
the
vessel
s
length
except
merely
to
hurry
from
one
vantage
to
out
of
the
ship
s
interior
and
scurrying
to
another
hole
and
vanishing
abruptly
like
a
rabbit
the
gale
was
dumb
till
it
met
and
was
torn
in
our
harsh
opposition
shouting
and
moaning
then
in
anger
and
torment
as
we
steadily
pressed
our
iron
into
its
ponderable
body
you
could
imagine
the
flawless
flood
of
air
pouring
silently
express
till
it
met
our
pillars
and
pinnacles
and
then
flying
past
rift
the
thousand
punctures
instantly
spreading
into
long
shrieking
lacerations
the
wounds
and
mouths
were
so
many
loud
and
poignant
that
you
wondered
you
could
not
see
them
our
structure
was
full
of
voices
but
the
weighty
body
which
drove
against
our
shrouds
and
funnel
guys
and
kept
them
strongly
vibrating
was
curiously
invisible
the
hard
jets
of
air
spurted
hissing
through
the
winches
the
sound
in
the
shrouds
and
stays
began
like
that
of
something
tearing
and
rose
to
a
high
keening
the
deeper
notes
were
amidships
in
the
alleyways
and
round
the
casing
but
there
the
ship
itself
contributed
a
note
a
metallic
murmur
so
profound
that
it
was
felt
as
a
tremor
rather
than
heard
it
was
almost
below
human
hearing
it
was
the
hollow
ship
resonant
the
steel
walls
decks
and
bulkheads
quivering
under
the
drumming
of
the
seas
and
the
regular
throws
of
the
far
below
it
was
on
this
day
the
capella
ceased
to
be
a
marine
engine
to
me
she
was
not
the
capella
of
the
swansea
docks
the
sea
waggon
squatting
low
in
the
water
with
bows
like
a
box
and
a
width
of
beam
which
made
her
seem
a
wharf
fixture
in
the
atlantic
her
bluff
bows
rose
to
meet
the
approaching
bulk
of
each
wave
with
such
steady
honesty
getting
up
heavily
to
meet
its
quick
wiles
it
is
true
but
often
with
such
success
that
we
found
ourselves
perched
at
a
height
above
the
gloom
of
the
hollow
seas
getting
more
light
and
seeing
more
world
though
sometimes
the
was
missed
she
was
not
quick
enough
and
broke
the
inflowing
ridge
with
her
face
she
behaved
so
like
a
brave
patient
thing
that
now
her
portrait
which
i
treasure
is
to
me
that
of
one
who
has
befriended
me
a
staunch
and
homely
body
who
never
tired
in
faithful
she
became
our
little
sanctuary
especially
near
dayfall
with
those
sombre
mounts
close
round
us
bringing
twilight
before
its
time
your
glance
caught
a
wave
passing
amidships
as
a
heaped
mass
of
polished
obsidian
having
minor
hollows
and
ridges
on
its
slopes
conchoidal
fractures
in
its
glass
it
rose
directly
and
acutely
from
your
feet
to
a
summit
that
was
awesome
because
the
eye
travelled
to
it
over
a
long
and
broken
this
hill
had
intervened
suddenly
to
obscure
thirty
degrees
of
light
and
the
imagination
shrank
from
contemplating
water
which
your
foothold
with
such
high
dark
bulk
toppling
in
collapse
the
steamer
leaning
that
side
your
face
was
quite
close
to
the
beginning
of
the
bare
mobile
down
where
it
swirled
past
in
a
vitreous
flux
tortured
lines
of
green
foam
buried
far
but
plain
in
its
translucent
deeps
it
passed
and
the
light
released
from
the
sky
streamed
over
the
capella
again
as
your
side
of
her
lifted
in
the
roll
the
sea
falling
down
her
iron
wall
as
far
as
the
bilge
the
steamer
spouted
violently
from
her
choked
valve
as
it
cleared
the
sea
like
a
swimmer
who
battles
and
then
gets
his
mouth
free
from
a
smother
her
task
against
those
head
seas
and
the
squalls
was
so
hard
and
continuous
that
the
murmur
of
her
heart
which
i
fancied
grew
louder
almost
to
a
moaning
when
her
body
sank
to
the
rails
the
panic
of
her
cries
when
the
screw
raced
when
she
lost
her
hold
her
noble
and
rhythmic
labourings
the
sense
of
her
concentrated
and
unremitting
power
given
by
the
smoke
driving
in
violence
from
her
swaying
funnel
the
cordage
quivering
in
tense
curves
the
seas
that
burst
in
her
face
as
clouds
falling
roaring
inboard
then
to
founder
half
her
length
she
presently
to
raise
her
heavy
body
slowly
out
of
an
acre
of
foam
the
cascades
streaming
from
her
in
veils
this
was
like
great
music
i
learned
why
a
ship
has
a
name
it
is
for
the
same
reason
that
you
and
i
have
names
she
has
happenings
according
to
her
own
weird
she
shows
perversities
and
virtues
her
parents
never
dreamed
into
the
plans
they
laid
for
her
her
heredity
can
not
be
explained
by
the
general
chemics
of
iron
and
steel
and
the
principles
of
the
steam
engine
but
something
counts
in
her
of
the
moods
of
her
creators
both
of
the
happy
men
and
the
sullen
men
whose
bright
or
dark
energies
poured
into
her
rivets
and
plates
as
they
hammered
and
now
suffuse
her
body
something
of
the
capella
was
revealed
to
me
our
ship
she
was
one
for
pride
and
trust
she
was
slow
but
that
slowness
was
of
her
dignity
and
size
she
had
valour
in
her
she
was
not
a
light
yacht
she
was
strong
and
hard
taking
heavy
punishment
and
then
lifting
her
broad
face
over
the
seas
to
look
for
the
next
enemy
but
was
she
slow
she
seemed
but
slow
the
eye
judged
by
those
assailing
hills
so
vast
and
whelmingly
quick
the
hills
were
so
dark
swift
and
great
moving
barely
inferior
to
the
clouds
which
travelled
with
them
the
collapsing
roof
which
fell
over
the
seas
flying
with
the
same
impulse
as
the
waters
there
was
the
uplifted
ocean
and
pressing
down
to
it
sundered
from
it
only
by
the
gale
forced
them
foundered
heavens
a
low
ceiling
which
would
have
been
night
itself
but
that
it
was
thinned
in
patches
by
some
solvent
day
and
our
capella
heavy
as
was
her
body
and
great
and
swift
as
were
the
hills
never
failed
to
carry
us
up
the
long
slopes
and
over
the
white
summits
which
moved
down
on
us
like
the
marked
approach
of
catastrophe
if
one
of
the
greater
hills
but
hit
us
i
one
did
late
that
afternoon
the
second
mate
who
was
on
watch
saw
such
a
wave
bearing
down
on
us
it
was
so
dominantly
above
us
that
instinctively
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
for
his
whistle
it
was
his
first
voyage
in
an
ocean
steamer
he
was
not
long
out
of
his
apprenticeship
in
sails
and
so
he
did
not
telegraph
to
stop
the
engines
the
skipper
looked
up
through
the
window
saw
the
high
gloom
of
this
wave
over
us
and
jumped
out
for
the
bridge
ladder
to
get
at
the
telegraph
himself
he
was
too
late
we
went
under
the
wave
stopped
us
with
the
shock
of
a
grounding
came
solid
over
our
and
broke
on
our
structure
amidships
the
concussion
itself
scattered
things
about
my
cabin
when
the
capella
showed
herself
again
the
ventilators
had
gone
the
windlass
was
damaged
and
the
iron
ends
of
the
drum
on
the
forecastle
head
on
which
a
steel
hawser
was
wound
had
been
doubled
on
themselves
like
tinfoil
by
day
these
movements
of
water
on
a
grand
scale
the
harsh
and
deep
noises
of
gale
and
breaking
seas
and
the
labouring
of
the
steamer
no
more
than
awed
me
at
least
my
sight
could
escape
but
courage
went
with
the
light
at
dusk
the
eye
which
had
the
liberty
during
the
hours
of
light
to
range
up
the
inclines
of
the
sea
to
distant
summits
and
note
that
these
dangers
always
passed
was
imprisoned
by
a
dreadful
apparition
when
there
was
more
night
than
day
in
the
dusk
you
saw
no
waves
you
saw
and
close
at
hand
only
vertical
shadows
and
they
swayed
noiselessly
without
progressing
on
the
fading
sky
high
over
you
i
could
but
think
the
ocean
level
had
risen
greatly
and
was
much
superior
to
us
all
round
the
capella
remained
then
in
a
precarious
nadir
of
the
waters
looking
aft
from
the
chief
s
cabin
i
could
see
of
our
ship
only
the
top
of
our
mainmast
because
that
projected
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
hollow
into
the
last
of
the
day
overhead
and
often
the
sheer
apparitions
oscillating
around
us
swung
above
the
truck
of
it
and
the
whole
length
vanished
the
sense
of
onward
movement
ceased
because
nothing
could
be
seen
passing
us
at
dusk
the
steamer
appeared
to
be
rocking
helplessly
in
a
narrow
sunken
place
which
never
had
an
outlet
for
us
the
shadows
of
the
seas
erect
over
us
did
not
move
away
but
their
ridges
pitched
at
changing
angles
you
know
the
sussex
chalk
hills
at
evening
just
at
that
time
when
from
the
foot
of
them
they
lose
all
detail
but
what
is
on
the
skyline
become
an
abrupt
plane
before
you
of
unequal
height
that
was
the
view
from
the
capella
except
that
the
skyline
moved
and
when
we
passed
a
barque
that
evening
it
looked
as
looks
a
solitary
bush
far
on
the
summit
of
the
downs
the
barque
did
not
pass
us
we
saw
it
fade
and
the
height
it
surmounted
fade
as
shadows
do
when
all
light
has
gone
but
where
we
saw
it
last
a
green
star
was
adrift
and
was
ranging
up
and
down
in
the
night
this
was
the
dark
time
when
struggling
from
amidships
to
the
poop
you
knew
there
was
something
organised
and
coherent
under
you
still
a
standing
place
in
chaos
only
because
you
could
feel
it
there
and
this
was
the
time
to
seek
your
fellows
in
the
saloon
where
there
was
light
warmth
sane
and
familiar
things
and
dinner
the
capella
s
saloon
was
fairly
large
and
the
skipper
s
pride
it
was
panelled
in
maple
and
oak
with
a
long
settee
at
the
foreward
end
upholstered
in
red
velvet
the
velvet
protected
by
a
calico
cover
a
brass
oil
lamp
with
an
opaline
shade
hung
over
the
table
from
a
beam
beneath
the
skylight
there
was
a
closed
american
stove
with
a
rigorously
polished
brass
flue
running
up
through
the
deck
on
two
oak
sideboards
in
corners
of
the
saloon
some
artificial
plants
blossomed
from
single
stems
each
plant
blossomed
into
flowers
of
aniline
dyes
and
of
different
species
one
of
these
plants
an
imitation
palm
and
a
better
imitation
of
life
than
the
others
was
carefully
watered
throughout
the
voyage
by
the
steward
till
it
wilted
into
corruption
and
an
offence
and
became
a
count
against
the
steward
which
the
skipper
never
forgave
for
he
thought
his
floral
ornaments
lovely
when
a
pretty
brazilian
lady
visitor
at
itacoatiara
admired
the
magenta
rays
of
one
blossom
he
culled
it
for
her
five
earnest
minutes
with
a
sharp
knife
for
there
was
wire
behind
the
green
bark
more
as
a
sacrifice
and
a
hard
duty
than
a
joy
and
often
spoke
of
it
afterwards
shaking
his
head
regretfully
ah
that
saloon
i
remember
it
first
shiny
cold
and
repellent
with
a
handful
of
fire
to
its
wide
capacity
for
draughts
in
the
northern
seas
it
had
curious
marine
odours
then
with
which
i
was
not
friendly
till
long
after
odours
that
lamps
burnished
brass
newly
polished
wood
food
and
the
steward
s
storeroom
behind
it
never
fully
accounted
for
and
i
remember
it
as
i
found
it
in
the
still
heat
of
the
amazon
when
it
had
the
air
of
an
oven
when
writing
in
it
the
sweat
ran
off
the
fingers
to
soil
the
paper
strange
insects
crawling
everywhere
on
its
green
baize
table
cover
and
banging
against
its
lamp
i
remember
it
assiduously
now
every
trivial
feature
of
it
and
the
men
now
scattered
over
all
the
world
thrown
together
in
it
then
for
a
spell
to
make
the
most
of
each
other
it
has
the
indelible
impress
of
a
room
of
that
house
where
first
the
interest
in
existence
awakened
in
us
the
skipper
with
stove
behind
him
took
his
seat
before
the
soup
tureen
at
the
head
of
the
table
you
would
as
soon
think
of
altering
the
clock
even
were
it
wrong
as
of
touching
the
soup
tureen
without
the
skipper
s
orders
it
is
his
duty
and
his
right
to
serve
the
soup
and
to
call
the
steward
to
inform
him
the
density
of
the
vegetables
in
it
is
too
heavy
we
have
no
market
garden
on
board
you
know
the
doctor
was
on
the
skipper
s
right
hand
and
the
purser
next
to
the
doctor
and
on
the
opposite
side
the
chief
mate
there
was
the
plump
and
german
steward
in
white
apron
the
lid
of
one
eye
heavier
than
the
other
serving
us
in
his
shirt
sleeves
sometimes
sucking
his
teeth
with
a
noticeable
click
when
he
knew
a
dish
deserved
our
approval
you
kept
the
soup
in
the
plate
by
holding
it
off
the
table
and
watching
its
tides
when
her
stern
sailed
up
and
the
screw
raced
the
glass
shade
of
the
lamp
being
a
misfit
took
our
eyes
to
watch
the
coming
smash
the
soup
then
poured
over
you
and
trying
to
push
your
chair
back
from
the
mess
you
found
the
chair
was
a
fixture
on
the
floor
this
last
fact
was
never
remembered
i
should
try
to
push
my
capella
chair
back
now
if
i
were
sitting
in
it
the
doctor
who
had
been
long
enough
tinkering
careless
bodies
to
have
grown
a
little
worn
and
grizzled
was
often
removed
from
us
by
a
faint
but
impervious
hauteur
though
maybe
he
was
only
a
little
better
and
differently
dressed
he
was
a
patient
listener
but
his
eyes
could
be
droll
the
doctor
s
chuckle
escaping
from
his
thoughts
while
he
was
unguarded
would
sometimes
make
the
captain
look
up
from
a
narrative
with
question
and
a
trace
of
resentment
in
his
glance
the
captain
was
a
great
traveller
but
he
was
puzzled
to
find
the
memory
of
our
surgeon
following
him
to
the
most
remote
and
unfamiliar
strands
now
how
did
that
fellow
come
to
be
at
a
place
like
that
the
captain
would
whisper
to
me
afterwards
can
t
make
him
out
who
is
he
the
surgeon
had
a
bottomless
fund
of
short
stories
to
which
he
would
sometimes
go
about
the
time
when
we
were
pushing
away
the
banana
skins
and
nutshells
he
had
an
elusive
and
stimulating
method
with
them
he
knew
his
work
at
the
end
of
one
the
captain
would
explain
the
fun
to
the
seriously
interested
mate
who
had
leaned
forward
to
learn
placing
spoons
and
crumbs
to
demonstrate
the
main
points
then
the
mate
too
would
join
us
with
his
happy
laugh
the
late
and
giddy
laughter
of
the
mate
when
he
also
arrived
became
a
welcome
feature
of
a
yarn
by
the
surgeon
we
expected
it
the
mate
s
own
stories
were
usually
bawdy
he
always
prefaced
them
with
some
unmanageable
hilarity
which
impeded
his
start
mate
over
his
plate
for
that
big
wave
washed
out
the
men
s
berths
sir
captain
then
it
did
some
good
the
dirty
brutes
mate
heard
the
men
grumbling
said
we
ll
never
get
the
hawsers
to
run
out
with
them
bugs
in
the
hawse
pipes
say
the
bugs
don
t
belong
to
them
s
property
doctor
any
this
end
of
the
ship
captain
good
lord
captain
not
a
bug
and
if
there
s
any
for
ard
the
men
brought
em
no
bugs
in
my
ship
never
saw
one
in
my
cabin
mate
a
confused
effort
to
master
his
emotion
not
to
spill
his
soup
and
to
be
you
will
sir
he
may
not
laugh
but
suffers
captain
an
interrogation
with
frightful
eyes
and
guttural
mate
himself
by
concentrating
on
a
well
m
just
telling
heard
it
said
the
men
annoyed
with
of
em
said
seein
s
believin
they
had
enough
for
everybody
voice
breaks
into
a
stifled
so
they
emptied
a
emptied
a
match
box
full
down
your
ventilator
this
morning
the
captain
would
frequently
keep
his
seat
in
the
saloon
after
dinner
till
he
had
finished
his
cigar
and
in
the
vein
would
put
a
leg
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
which
he
had
pushed
back
his
chair
was
cushioned
and
was
not
a
fixture
and
frowning
at
his
cigar
as
if
for
defects
would
voyage
again
his
early
seas
i
suppose
a
sailor
would
call
our
skipper
a
hard
case
he
was
an
elderly
man
tall
spare
and
meagrely
bearded
his
eyes
were
set
close
into
a
nose
and
they
were
opaque
and
bright
like
two
blue
stones
under
a
forehead
which
narrowed
and
tightened
into
a
small
shiny
cranium
there
were
tufts
of
grey
wool
above
his
temples
no
light
came
through
his
eyes
to
make
them
limpid
except
when
he
was
fondling
tinker
the
dog
they
shone
from
the
surface
giving
him
a
look
of
peering
and
intent
suspicion
the
skin
of
his
face
neck
and
hands
now
worked
a
little
loose
was
so
steeped
in
the
tincture
of
sunshine
that
it
had
preserved
an
unctious
quality
his
dress
and
habits
betrayed
an
appreciation
of
his
own
person
he
kept
his
own
medicines
i
guessed
he
would
have
a
ruthless
process
in
an
emergency
he
would
identify
the
success
and
safety
of
the
ship
with
his
own
he
laughed
from
his
mouth
only
throwing
his
head
back
showing
surprisingly
perfect
teeth
and
laughter
did
not
change
the
crystalline
glitter
of
his
eyes
there
was
something
alien
and
startling
in
his
merriment
as
though
his
own
mind
were
too
cold
for
him
at
times
he
would
seek
out
me
or
the
chief
to
find
warmth
in
an
argument
he
would
irritate
us
into
a
disputation
and
though
he
was
a
choleric
man
quick
at
opposition
yet
his
vocabulary
then
was
flinty
and
sparse
it
stuck
and
was
delivered
with
pain
you
could
think
of
him
labouring
at
his
views
of
men
and
affairs
with
a
creaking
slate
pencil
he
set
one
s
teeth
but
he
was
a
sailor
cautious
and
bold
with
a
knowledge
of
ships
and
the
sea
that
was
a
mine
to
me
let
me
say
that
during
the
voyage
i
found
him
busy
making
a
canvas
cot
he
sat
on
the
poop
and
worked
there
bent
and
patient
as
a
seamstress
for
days
with
a
judgment
made
too
readily
i
believed
he
was
naturally
making
it
for
his
own
comfort
against
the
heat
of
the
river
when
it
was
finished
he
was
rolling
up
his
ball
of
yarn
surveying
his
job
and
he
said
mumbling
and
shy
that
the
cot
was
for
me
the
skipper
on
this
day
that
our
decks
were
swept
swore
about
the
men
and
the
bugs
during
dinner
muttered
with
foreboding
about
the
glass
which
was
still
falling
and
the
coals
which
were
being
burnt
to
no
purpose
we
were
hardly
doing
more
than
holding
our
place
on
our
course
the
saloon
was
delirious
and
when
she
flung
up
her
heels
the
varied
noises
rose
with
the
racing
propeller
to
a
crescendo
of
furious
castenets
the
mate
let
us
the
skipper
sat
glooming
eyeing
his
cigar
resentfully
his
leg
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
the
doctor
was
swaying
with
the
ship
weary
and
forlorn
tinker
had
an
appeal
in
his
eyes
and
made
timorous
noises
the
purser
wondered
why
he
was
there
at
all
and
blamed
his
silly
dreams
the
night
boomed
without
what
a
night
skipper
if
this
southerly
wind
goes
round
to
the
west
and
north
look
out
i
saw
porpoises
too
doctor
when
are
we
due
at
para
skipper
huh
what
s
this
talk
of
para
you
wait
all
this
talk
about
when
we
shall
get
there
s
no
good
now
in
those
newfoundland
schooners
where
i
served
my
wouldn
t
have
no
talk
in
them
about
getting
anywhere
seems
as
if
somebody
heard
you
always
run
into
it
there
was
the
lizzie
she
was
about
tons
those
west
country
schooners
in
the
fish
trade
are
never
more
than
tons
else
they
d
have
to
carry
more
than
a
master
and
one
mate
i
was
her
master
and
a
kid
of
eighteen
we
left
falmouth
for
cadiz
now
look
what
happened
my
mate
was
old
tregenna
he
was
a
regular
misery
i
never
knew
such
a
dead
homer
not
so
much
as
he
was
always
wanting
to
talk
about
his
wife
i
say
when
you
ve
cast
off
it
s
best
not
to
have
a
home
the
ship
wants
all
you
can
give
her
tregenna
he
looked
back
a
lot
you
know
what
i
mean
couldn
t
keep
his
mind
on
his
job
but
wished
he
was
through
with
it
there
he
d
be
cutting
bread
at
dinner
and
it
ud
remind
him
and
he
d
be
wishing
he
was
cutting
it
at
home
when
things
began
to
go
stiff
he
d
say
who
wouldn
t
sell
his
little
farm
to
go
to
sea
used
to
figure
out
on
paper
how
long
we
d
be
before
we
d
be
back
why
you
never
know
when
you
ll
get
back
see
what
happened
we
left
cadiz
that
year
on
the
first
of
january
and
got
things
just
right
the
winds
chased
us
over
there
were
big
following
seas
but
you
know
those
schooners
ride
like
ducks
up
and
over
they
go
never
a
drop
did
we
ship
though
they
re
lively
enough
to
bruise
and
sicken
all
but
good
sailors
and
old
tregenna
was
rubbing
his
hands
and
making
out
his
figures
better
and
better
we
arrived
off
johns
in
a
bit
more
than
three
weeks
i
reckon
i
d
done
it
all
right
being
such
a
young
chap
too
well
i
was
turning
in
that
night
and
just
as
i
got
into
the
companion
a
man
said
there
goes
a
lump
of
i
jumped
out
again
why
there
was
ice
all
round
us
the
sea
was
full
of
it
as
far
as
i
could
see
into
the
night
this
is
all
along
of
your
figuring
i
sang
out
to
tregenna
but
you
ll
have
a
lot
of
time
to
reckon
it
up
afresh
i
said
so
he
had
do
you
know
when
we
got
in
we
got
in
on
april
we
were
two
months
and
a
half
getting
in
and
we
came
over
in
three
weeks
there
s
something
in
that
jonah
story
always
some
fool
who
can
t
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
his
mind
on
his
job
we
did
have
a
time
two
and
a
half
months
and
our
provisions
ran
out
we
were
living
on
a
little
meal
and
dried
peas
the
ice
chafed
the
lizzie
till
the
rudder
was
worn
down
to
the
stock
it
roughed
up
her
wooden
sides
till
they
looked
as
if
they
were
covered
with
long
coarse
hair
we
were
a
sight
when
we
got
in
you
wouldn
t
have
known
us
hardly
we
looked
as
if
we
d
come
up
from
the
bottom
don
t
ask
me
when
we
shall
get
to
para
wait
till
we
re
out
of
this
listen
to
that
dog
shut
up
you
tinker
making
that
noise
sir
go
and
lie
down
the
skipper
clapped
on
his
cap
aggressively
and
went
out
the
doctor
had
a
long
and
eloquent
silence
then
he
turned
to
me
this
beats
all
he
said
come
and
have
a
drop
of
gin
old
he
led
the
way
to
his
berth
which
smelt
of
varnish
and
of
lamp
and
we
swayed
in
chorus
as
the
ship
rolled
and
had
a
heartening
mourn
together
but
for
its
accidental
compensations
travel
would
not
be
worth
the
trouble
in
proof
of
that
there
is
the
entry
in
my
diary
some
days
after
december
awoke
at
four
with
the
ship
rolling
as
brutally
as
ever
a
great
noise
of
waters
and
things
banging
the
seas
huge
at
sunrise
when
the
light
came
over
their
tops
depressing
sight
the
sky
was
blue
at
first
but
was
soon
overcast
with
squalls
the
horizon
ahead
gets
slate
coloured
and
low
clouds
underneath
like
ragged
bales
of
dirty
wool
come
towards
us
heavy
and
fast
then
the
squall
and
waves
rush
down
on
us
express
and
the
ship
buries
herself
constantly
hearing
bell
sounded
from
bridge
to
slacken
speed
as
a
big
sea
appears
the
captain
popped
in
his
head
as
i
was
deciding
whether
to
get
up
or
stay
where
i
was
he
gazed
sternly
at
me
and
said
he
was
looking
for
jonah
i
half
believe
he
means
it
too
everybody
is
weary
of
this
the
men
have
been
in
oilskins
since
the
start
noon
lat
long
miles
by
engines
since
noon
yesterday
knots
by
revolutions
but
the
slip
is
per
cent
so
actual
distance
miles
only
and
knots
bad
going
wind
southly
engines
racing
and
engineer
still
at
throttle
night
and
a
full
moon
tearing
past
cloud
openings
the
ship
occasionally
shows
like
a
pale
ghost
the
black
shadows
of
the
funnel
guys
and
stanchions
oscillating
on
the
white
as
she
rolls
i
went
into
chief
s
cabin
and
from
its
open
it
was
sensibly
out
astern
over
the
way
we
had
come
up
and
down
this
side
and
that
went
the
steamer
and
the
great
bear
in
a
wind
clear
patch
of
sky
was
dancing
on
our
wake
polaris
was
making
eccentric
orbits
round
the
main
masthead
light
then
the
skipper
came
in
he
sat
gazing
astern
the
look
of
his
face
was
enough
it
was
quite
plain
he
would
like
to
be
offended
and
attack
anybody
about
anything
presently
he
started
intently
as
he
looked
astern
and
jumped
from
his
seat
crying
the
ultimate
anathema
on
the
chap
at
the
wheel
and
ran
out
the
chief
glanced
astern
and
laughed
the
old
man
comes
in
here
because
it
s
uncommon
handy
for
watching
the
wake
look
at
it
somebody
on
the
bridge
writing
letters
on
the
ocean
thinking
of
his
sweetheart
and
her
name
is
we
gave
the
skipper
s
voice
time
to
reach
the
wheelhouse
and
then
saw
the
wake
visibly
tauten
out
i
went
aft
balancing
like
a
man
learning
the
tight
rope
along
the
trestle
bridge
the
moon
was
still
falling
precipitously
through
the
broken
sky
and
areas
of
the
great
seas
where
the
sweeping
searchlight
of
the
moon
showed
monsters
shaping
and
slowly
vanishing
were
frightful
there
were
sudden
expansions
of
vivid
green
lightnings
in
the
north
and
east
i
found
the
doctor
in
the
chief
mate
s
cabin
i
sang
some
songs
in
a
riving
minor
accompanied
by
the
mate
on
an
accordion
for
the
doctor
s
amusement
and
discovered
why
sailors
always
use
the
accordion
previously
a
mystery
to
me
it
has
a
sad
and
reflective
note
suited
to
men
with
memories
when
alone
on
the
ocean
it
ought
to
fit
celtic
bards
better
than
the
harp
it
has
a
fine
expiring
moan
the
mate
gave
an
imitation
of
a
dying
man
with
it
to
bed
at
tried
to
read
henry
james
my
cockroach
came
out
to
wave
his
derisive
hands
at
me
no
wonder
the
light
was
very
bad
and
i
was
pitched
from
side
to
side
of
the
bunk
nearly
thrown
out
once
i
might
just
as
well
have
attempted
to
read
the
in
the
original
so
i
read
the
last
letters
from
home
instead
and
then
fell
asleep
as
a
little
there
was
something
of
leisure
in
her
movements
next
morning
i
felt
sure
the
glass
must
be
rising
at
last
the
air
felt
lighter
and
more
expansive
a
peep
through
the
port
showed
me
the
ceiling
had
gone
up
considerably
in
the
night
there
was
little
wind
for
the
waves
though
as
great
as
ever
had
lost
their
white
ridges
their
summits
were
rounded
and
smooth
we
were
running
south
out
of
it
though
the
residue
of
the
dreary
northern
seas
was
still
washing
about
the
decks
it
was
december
yesterday
but
april
the
engineers
messroom
boy
with
bare
fat
arms
went
by
the
cabin
singing
at
breakfast
we
heard
that
chips
who
had
retired
to
his
bunk
for
some
days
past
to
mend
a
leg
damaged
when
the
hatches
were
in
danger
had
met
with
a
still
more
serious
misfortune
we
fell
into
a
mood
of
silent
and
respectful
compassion
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
chips
had
lost
his
victoria
cross
he
was
an
old
hero
in
trouble
the
few
of
us
who
were
british
most
of
us
were
germans
dutchmen
scandinavians
and
we
represented
the
country
chips
limped
about
the
forecastle
with
reproach
in
his
face
and
we
felt
we
were
petty
in
noticing
his
face
was
also
dirty
though
it
certainly
was
difficult
to
avoid
seeing
that
too
perhaps
because
and
this
can
be
said
for
us
the
dirt
was
of
longer
standing
than
the
reproach
then
again
it
is
common
knowledge
that
chips
sleeps
in
straw
having
no
mattress
chips
story
we
knew
it
had
been
whispered
about
the
ship
he
was
at
the
siege
of
alexandria
and
a
shell
fell
near
a
group
of
men
on
his
ship
chips
picked
it
up
and
dropped
it
overboard
before
the
fuse
was
finished
the
doctor
and
i
felt
especially
responsible
for
a
reason
i
can
not
easily
explain
it
is
so
vague
and
we
told
chips
we
would
help
him
in
his
search
for
his
lost
treasure
this
took
us
to
chips
and
amid
a
group
of
how
could
foreigners
guess
what
this
mattered
to
us
hunted
carefully
for
chips
his
aureole
we
i
suppose
even
victoria
cross
heroes
must
dirty
their
socks
there
were
other
things
also
yet
it
was
out
of
one
of
these
very
other
things
which
were
i
think
shirts
that
there
dropped
when
the
doctor
picked
up
the
garment
a
little
package
wrapped
in
newspaper
chips
from
his
berth
gave
a
cry
of
joy
the
doctor
and
i
smiling
too
looked
upon
the
old
man
feeling
that
we
had
acted
for
you
all
chips
secretive
with
his
sacrosanct
emblem
was
putting
the
little
packet
under
his
coverlet
when
a
low
foreign
sailor
snatched
it
from
him
the
cross
fell
to
the
deck
i
recovered
it
from
the
feet
instantly
in
a
white
passion
and
chanced
to
look
at
it
it
confirmed
that
one
who
is
named
chips
here
was
something
in
the
royal
and
ancient
order
of
buffaloes
coming
back
from
the
fo
castle
suddenly
i
felt
as
the
man
of
the
suburbs
does
when
bowed
with
months
of
black
winter
and
work
in
a
city
alley
he
is
without
any
warning
transfigured
on
his
own
doorstep
one
morning
there
as
before
is
his
familiar
shrub
dripping
with
rain
yet
is
it
as
before
it
points
a
black
finger
at
him
but
the
finger
has
a
polished
green
nail
he
is
translated
his
ears
are
opened
and
there
comes
for
the
first
time
that
year
the
silver
whistle
of
the
starlings
a
touch
of
south
is
in
the
air
his
burden
falls
the
cloudy
sky
was
not
grey
now
but
pearly
for
it
was
translucent
to
the
sun
more
than
day
had
come
life
was
born
there
was
ichor
in
the
day
they
were
not
dark
northern
waves
that
baffled
us
but
we
were
shoved
and
rocked
by
the
send
of
a
long
nacreous
ocean
swell
firm
but
kind
from
the
the
iron
ship
which
had
been
repulsive
to
the
touch
for
its
face
had
been
glassy
and
cold
was
now
drying
a
warm
rust
red
like
earth
of
devon
in
spring
and
was
responsive
you
could
rest
against
its
iron
body
and
feel
yourself
grow
i
saw
the
chief
outside
his
cabin
in
his
shirt
sleeves
gazing
overseas
between
the
stanchions
of
the
boat
deck
smoking
in
the
evident
luxury
of
full
comfort
and
release
involuntarily
he
danced
the
as
she
rolled
got
anything
to
read
he
asked
now
that
reminded
me
we
have
no
library
of
course
but
we
have
a
circulation
of
books
on
board
there
are
no
common
shelves
but
the
book
you
left
thoughtlessly
on
the
skylight
five
minutes
ago
while
you
went
to
find
some
matches
is
gone
when
you
return
and
you
if
you
see
a
book
lying
open
and
unprotected
in
a
cabin
glance
round
warily
dash
in
and
take
it
very
often
only
to
discover
to
your
bitter
disappointment
that
it
is
one
of
your
own
and
not
an
adventurous
and
unread
stranger
the
chief
s
question
reminded
me
that
the
day
we
left
swansea
a
lady
and
a
friend
of
poor
jack
the
public
is
well
aware
sent
us
a
bale
of
literature
we
blessed
her
when
we
saw
its
bulk
looking
at
it
as
oxen
might
look
at
a
truss
of
hay
for
that
was
its
size
and
shape
though
it
proved
to
be
shavings
and
a
cruel
blow
to
the
animals
as
you
shall
hear
here
was
the
very
day
to
get
at
that
bale
and
impatiently
i
rolled
it
into
the
open
it
was
trussed
with
great
care
so
i
tore
away
a
corner
of
the
wrappings
dived
in
a
hand
and
hauled
out
a
copy
of
joy
bells
for
young
christians
the
november
number
of
well
anyhow
it
was
a
clean
copy
and
i
put
it
by
as
the
portion
of
our
german
steward
this
disappointment
made
me
pause
though
here
was
going
to
be
a
long
job
for
the
purser
sorting
out
this
supposing
there
was
anything
nutritious
in
the
bale
i
did
not
mind
the
labour
of
the
unpacking
and
the
distribution
but
if
the
bulk
of
the
consignment
was
hailed
so
to
speak
by
joy
bells
then
it
would
be
better
to
call
a
deck
hand
and
get
the
package
overside
before
the
ship
was
littered
with
too
much
of
this
joy
a
brazilian
stoker
as
he
passed
saw
me
standing
in
thought
and
i
suppose
he
could
not
i
wanted
to
cut
the
string
but
had
no
knife
before
i
could
stop
him
he
smiling
a
knowing
and
friendly
smile
whipped
out
a
blade
from
his
rear
and
at
once
we
stood
in
literature
there
was
a
landslide
near
me
of
infant
methodists
dates
unknown
and
i
gave
the
brazilian
an
armful
for
his
kindness
our
dear
unknown
friend
at
swansea
with
her
eye
on
our
but
yet
immortal
souls
had
heard
no
doubt
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
society
for
the
succor
of
seamen
at
caxton
hall
westminster
held
on
the
of
every
february
what
simple
and
barbarous
and
yet
in
the
main
considering
our
origins
and
circumstances
what
worthy
fellows
we
were
but
she
was
not
told
at
the
meeting
that
the
wealthy
shipowners
subscribers
to
the
society
and
whose
presence
there
made
caxton
hall
seem
nautical
have
a
way
of
signing
on
crews
at
continental
ports
because
wages
rule
lower
there
and
that
consequently
not
one
of
our
men
was
moved
by
christian
english
but
only
by
mates
english
and
then
not
so
very
quickly
the
officers
and
engineers
were
english
and
there
the
sailors
friend
was
right
in
her
surmise
but
i
do
not
see
how
she
could
have
done
more
to
put
in
awful
jeopardy
the
soul
of
our
wise
and
spectacled
chief
engineer
for
instance
than
by
approaching
him
with
a
winning
and
philanthropic
smile
under
the
impulse
to
do
him
good
with
a
statement
of
her
religion
in
words
of
one
syllable
he
would
have
met
her
politely
i
know
but
after
she
had
let
her
try
to
imagine
her
own
feelings
if
our
chief
uninvited
and
blankly
unmindful
invaded
the
exclusive
inner
circle
of
swansea
society
and
approached
her
in
the
midst
of
her
own
with
the
childish
notion
of
instructing
her
in
the
first
principles
of
his
pronounced
pyrrhonism
or
say
he
went
to
her
as
a
colporteur
of
the
society
for
instructing
the
intelligence
and
manners
of
leisured
folk
but
i
must
say
for
our
chief
that
this
can
not
be
even
supposed
he
would
never
offer
the
lowliest
being
such
an
indignity
we
pulled
and
dragged
at
the
escaped
mass
of
periodicals
looking
for
something
good
but
found
no
pearls
had
been
cast
before
us
there
were
parish
magazines
and
temperance
monthlies
there
were
religious
almanacs
for
the
years
we
have
lost
by
some
sporting
chance
there
were
even
a
few
back
numbers
of
the
monumental
it
is
plain
the
latter
could
be
considered
an
added
grievance
even
though
they
were
put
in
as
a
kindly
reminder
of
our
narrow
lease
here
it
was
an
aggravation
of
the
original
offence
to
sailors
who
when
their
short
term
here
closes
have
to
make
shift
with
some
firebars
at
their
heels
what
is
aberdeen
granite
and
indelible
gold
lettering
to
such
men
but
a
hint
of
the
hardships
which
follow
them
even
beyond
the
end
so
overboard
went
the
may
as
well
tell
the
whole
truth
overboard
also
went
the
evangelical
hymn
books
new
though
they
were
i
will
only
suppress
the
advice
cried
to
the
gulls
astern
as
the
literature
went
floating
and
flying
in
their
direction
we
had
to
rely
for
our
reading
on
what
had
been
brought
aboard
by
our
crowd
a
collection
which
gradually
revealed
itself
in
single
books
and
magazines
there
was
for
example
the
morphology
of
the
cryptogamia
an
exhaustive
work
which
gave
me
much
pleasure
in
wondering
how
it
got
aboard
at
all
the
chief
mate
used
it
as
a
wedge
between
his
open
door
and
the
bulkhead
to
prevent
the
miserable
knocking
as
the
ship
lolled
about
he
would
not
lend
me
that
book
because
it
jammed
into
the
opening
nicely
but
i
borrowed
from
him
three
fingered
jack
the
terror
of
the
antilles
and
i
made
him
a
complete
gift
in
return
of
robert
elsmere
which
i
found
marooned
on
a
bunker
hatch
as
i
came
along
there
you
see
the
delightful
chance
and
hazardous
character
of
our
literature
i
prided
myself
on
the
select
reading
i
had
brought
aboard
with
me
but
what
devilish
black
art
the
sea
air
worked
on
those
choice
volumes
however
i
can
not
explain
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
there
they
are
their
covers
bitten
by
cockroaches
and
the
words
inside
bleached
and
sterilised
of
all
meaning
there
they
will
stop
henry
james
too
for
what
is
the
use
of
him
when
big
seas
are
running
he
would
be
a
magician
indeed
who
could
capture
our
minds
then
you
get
the
right
amplitude
of
leisure
and
the
flat
undistracting
circumstances
he
demands
the
emptiness
and
the
immobility
necessary
when
you
are
waiting
for
cargo
long
in
coming
at
a
low
seaboard
i
suppose
we
want
the
representation
of
life
only
when
we
are
not
very
much
alive
in
heavy
weather
there
is
no
doubt
old
newspapers
make
the
best
reading
especially
if
they
have
good
bold
advertisements
for
i
know
it
requires
the
same
courage
and
concentration
needed
ashore
for
reading
another
great
speech
by
the
premier
indeed
the
steel
blue
quality
of
deadly
resolution
used
only
by
men
of
letters
who
write
biographies
and
spin
literary
causeries
to
manage
even
novels
when
great
billows
are
moving
the
mind
is
inclined
to
absent
itself
then
then
it
is
you
put
all
reading
aside
with
a
promise
of
a
long
and
leisurely
festival
of
books
when
the
ship
is
steaming
uniformly
down
the
unvarying
but
when
you
get
near
the
neighbourhood
of
the
constant
sun
during
the
day
you
fall
asleep
over
three
fingered
jack
and
the
old
magazines
which
you
had
on
your
knees
while
musing
on
the
colours
of
the
sea
and
the
mounting
architecture
of
the
clouds
and
beyond
sundown
listen
to
the
mate
s
accordion
or
the
engineer
s
flute
perhaps
moved
by
the
of
the
waves
the
silky
and
purple
dark
and
the
loneliness
of
your
little
company
under
the
stars
tentatively
though
your
shipmates
are
very
forgiving
lift
a
ballad
yourself
for
something
is
expected
of
you
and
singing
seems
right
of
all
the
books
aboard
the
capella
i
got
most
out
of
the
skipper
s
sailing
directories
and
his
charts
talk
of
romance
there
was
that
under
the
bridge
across
its
open
doors
on
either
side
creaming
waves
going
by
in
the
moonlight
and
the
steamer
inclining
each
side
alternately
and
the
shadows
of
the
rigging
sliding
back
and
forth
on
the
pale
deck
you
can
not
know
what
romance
is
till
you
are
in
seas
you
have
never
sailed
before
where
the
marks
will
be
few
when
landfall
comes
that
ocean
where
the
skipper
is
to
find
his
own
way
by
his
lore
of
the
sea
and
may
even
ask
your
opinion
about
alternatives
and
there
read
sailing
directories
the
romance
of
these
books
can
not
be
translated
or
quoted
it
would
leave
them
as
though
a
glimmer
went
out
if
you
attempted
to
take
them
from
that
where
pendant
things
are
swaying
leisurely
where
you
can
hear
the
bells
tell
the
watches
and
the
skipper
s
cap
is
on
the
mahogany
table
the
south
atlantic
sailing
directions
our
own
guide
is
fine
especially
when
it
gets
down
to
the
uninhabited
islands
in
far
southern
latitudes
i
do
not
think
this
noble
volume
is
included
in
the
best
hundred
books
but
i
know
it
can
release
the
mind
from
the
body
but
what
s
this
talk
of
landfalls
as
the
old
man
would
say
there
will
be
no
landfall
yet
for
us
and
this
is
christmas
eve
i
knew
it
was
an
auspicious
occasion
of
some
kind
for
the
steward
just
went
aft
with
two
big
plum
cakes
cuddled
in
his
apron
that
made
me
look
at
the
calendar
we
are
now
miles
out
and
the
steamer
has
reached
six
knots
this
was
the
best
night
we
had
yet
found
the
steamer
was
on
an
even
keel
with
but
occasional
spasms
of
sharp
rolling
for
there
was
no
sea
but
only
old
ocean
breathing
deeply
and
regularly
in
its
sleep
and
sometimes
making
a
slight
movement
the
light
of
the
full
moon
was
the
shining
ghost
of
noon
the
steamer
was
distinct
but
immaterial
saliently
accentuated
as
a
phantom
a
deep
shadow
would
have
detached
the
forecastle
head
but
for
a
length
of
luminous
bulwark
which
still
held
it
and
some
quiet
voices
of
men
who
were
within
the
shadow
yarning
the
line
of
bulwark
and
the
murmuring
voices
held
us
together
the
prow
as
it
dipped
sank
into
drifts
of
lambent
snow
the
snow
fled
by
the
steamer
s
sides
melting
and
musical
two
engineers
off
duty
leaned
on
the
rails
amidships
smoking
looking
into
the
vacancy
in
which
the
moonlight
laid
a
floor
of
troubled
silver
as
if
drawn
by
its
light
a
few
little
clouds
were
poised
near
the
moon
grouped
round
the
bright
heart
of
the
night
there
was
the
moon
and
its
small
company
of
clouds
and
ourselves
below
in
our
own
defined
allotment
of
sea
the
only
thing
outside
and
far
was
sirius
burning
independently
in
the
east
looking
unwinking
through
the
wall
of
night
into
our
world
on
such
a
night
and
with
christmas
morning
but
sixty
minutes
away
it
would
have
been
wasting
life
to
go
to
bed
i
glanced
expectantly
at
the
door
of
the
chief
s
cabin
and
saw
indeed
it
was
open
a
yellow
rectangle
within
which
was
the
profile
of
the
chief
beneath
his
lamp
talking
to
somebody
the
doctor
was
there
and
he
made
room
for
me
on
the
settee
then
the
captain
joined
us
and
i
perched
myself
on
the
washstand
well
we
can
undress
when
we
turn
in
said
the
chief
none
of
us
had
so
far
in
a
long
silence
which
filled
the
cabin
with
tobacco
smoke
i
could
hear
the
engines
below
uplifted
in
confident
song
now
they
re
walking
round
said
the
skipper
nodding
his
head
now
she
feels
when
we
met
thus
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
midnight
as
was
our
irregular
habit
the
talk
first
was
always
desultory
and
about
our
own
ship
and
our
own
circumstances
for
the
concerns
of
our
little
world
strangely
occupied
our
minds
as
you
would
think
and
the
large
affairs
of
that
great
world
we
had
left
of
which
we
heard
now
no
sound
nor
rumour
had
lessened
in
the
mind
faded
and
vanished
all
the
huge
consequence
and
loud
clangour
of
it
so
that
now
there
was
an
empty
horizon
astern
and
nothing
between
us
and
that
void
but
a
few
gulls
like
small
and
pursuing
recollections
our
little
microcosm
afloat
and
sundered
in
the
wastes
was
occupied
in
its
own
polity
we
talked
of
the
carpenter
s
bad
leg
complained
of
the
cook
s
bread
heard
that
tinker
the
dog
being
young
had
the
habit
at
night
while
honest
folk
slept
of
eating
the
saloon
mats
grumbled
that
the
ship
s
tobacco
was
mouldy
the
deck
was
getting
dry
the
skipper
said
and
now
we
could
get
the
men
chipping
it
and
then
it
could
be
tarred
that
donkeyman
said
the
skipper
that
man
wastes
the
fresh
water
i
ll
have
a
lock
put
on
the
pump
handle
he
works
it
as
if
we
were
laid
out
to
the
main
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
this
the
fresh
water
is
a
vital
affair
with
us
we
may
not
drink
the
water
of
the
country
to
which
we
are
bound
so
eighty
tons
of
welsh
mountain
spring
is
in
our
cleansed
and
whitewashed
tanks
woe
to
the
man
caught
overflowing
his
can
if
an
officer
sees
him
the
handle
can
t
be
locked
said
the
chief
because
it
s
next
to
the
galley
the
cook
wants
it
all
day
well
let
me
catch
anyone
wasting
it
we
d
look
all
right
with
a
lot
of
dysentery
drinking
that
river
water
out
this
common
of
ours
the
chief
s
cabin
is
on
a
highway
of
the
ship
being
on
the
direct
route
from
the
poop
to
the
bridge
and
so
it
is
a
hostel
for
the
chief
is
a
kindly
and
popular
man
big
and
robust
in
body
and
mind
though
he
has
a
knack
at
odd
and
unexpected
times
of
being
candid
in
a
way
that
shocks
treading
on
corns
without
ruth
the
skipper
s
particularly
when
their
two
departments
are
at
a
difference
this
cabin
was
one
which
i
always
visited
first
for
especially
in
the
morning
when
other
folk
had
not
rubbed
the
night
out
of
their
eyes
and
so
looked
darkly
upon
their
fellows
my
friend
the
chief
had
the
early
eye
of
a
child
and
the
soaring
spirit
of
the
lark
i
never
met
him
when
he
had
got
out
of
bed
on
the
wrong
side
his
cabin
became
a
refuge
to
me
for
unlike
the
doctor
s
and
my
own
place
we
both
were
birds
of
passage
therefore
our
cabins
were
cold
and
stark
the
chief
s
was
comfortable
with
settled
furniture
cosy
and
habitable
like
a
fixed
home
there
was
a
wicker
chair
with
cushions
and
a
where
the
engineer
s
log
lay
handy
and
bearing
some
plug
tobacco
freshly
cut
on
its
cover
and
a
pipe
rack
above
the
desk
carrying
a
most
foul
assortment
waiting
their
turns
again
for
favour
portraits
of
the
chief
s
family
were
on
the
walls
smiling
boys
and
girls
with
their
mother
in
a
chief
place
looking
upon
daddy
by
proxy
there
was
a
bookshelf
bearing
some
engineering
manuals
a
few
novels
and
magazines
a
tape
measure
some
gauge
glasses
some
tin
whistles
a
flute
and
a
palm
leaf
fan
above
the
washstand
was
a
rack
with
glasses
and
a
carafe
a
settee
ran
along
one
side
and
his
bunk
upon
the
other
side
there
we
sat
on
christmas
eve
while
the
wicker
chair
bent
and
complained
with
the
skipper
s
weight
as
he
swayed
to
the
leisurely
rocking
of
the
ship
the
tobacco
smoke
floated
in
coils
and
blue
smears
in
the
room
a
bottle
of
hollands
rested
for
security
on
the
bed
and
we
held
our
glasses
on
our
knees
the
pallid
and
puffy
face
of
the
steward
a
very
honest
man
secretly
free
with
his
small
store
of
apples
on
my
account
because
i
am
green
and
my
palate
not
yet
used
to
the
flatness
of
tinned
provisions
looked
in
on
us
from
the
right
vhere
is
der
dog
sir
i
haf
not
seen
der
must
be
about
we
cried
we
had
seen
him
we
said
nosing
about
the
poop
for
rats
or
asleep
on
the
saloon
mat
or
padding
round
the
casing
looking
for
but
no
i
haf
looked
he
is
not
found
vhere
is
der
dog
a
hole
in
our
little
community
it
was
apparent
from
our
intent
looks
could
not
be
thought
of
with
equanimity
tinker
s
importance
became
quite
large
the
second
engineer
passed
the
door
caught
the
drift
of
our
anxious
converse
and
turned
to
say
the
dog
was
then
asleep
in
his
room
ach
zat
is
all
we
struck
matches
for
our
pipes
again
that
dog
i
shouldn
t
like
to
lose
him
said
the
skipper
stroking
his
beard
there
s
no
luck
in
that
i
shot
a
dog
once
on
a
ship
and
first
we
ran
into
a
blow
and
lost
a
lot
of
gear
and
then
the
mate
got
his
hand
smashed
and
then
everything
got
till
i
d
have
paid
ah
fifty
pounds
to
have
had
the
brute
back
again
and
an
ugly
customer
he
was
ah
you
can
smile
doctor
but
there
it
is
i
m
not
superstitious
and
never
was
but
you
can
t
tell
me
look
at
the
things
that
happen
when
i
was
a
youngster
my
ship
was
off
rio
and
i
dreamt
my
father
was
dead
i
took
my
bearings
and
the
time
i
dreamt
my
father
died
in
a
red
brick
house
with
a
laylock
tree
by
the
door
and
that
tree
was
in
blossom
plain
enough
to
smell
i
didn
t
know
the
house
there
was
a
path
of
clean
red
bricks
leading
up
to
the
porch
through
a
garden
i
didn
t
see
my
father
but
you
know
what
dreams
are
sense
in
the
house
was
and
not
a
soul
in
sight
i
knew
he
was
dying
inside
how
do
you
account
for
that
have
you
got
it
down
in
your
books
i
lay
you
haven
t
i
forgot
all
about
that
dream
long
after
i
was
at
cape
town
and
met
my
brother
that
reminded
me
after
a
bit
i
said
to
him
father
s
yes
he
said
but
how
did
you
know
said
i
was
the
house
like
this
and
i
told
him
yes
he
said
it
was
like
that
a
place
he
was
staying
at
in
essex
but
how
did
you
know
i
didn
t
tell
him
what
s
the
good
he
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
people
don
all
through
the
anxious
time
when
we
were
being
soused
and
buffeted
i
noticed
how
our
company
every
man
of
them
even
the
pyrrhonist
saw
omens
in
all
the
chance
variety
of
the
vast
menace
under
the
frown
of
which
we
huddled
in
our
iron
box
porpoises
alongside
one
of
mother
cary
s
dark
brood
accompanying
us
glancing
about
the
vagaries
of
the
flowing
hills
with
swift
precision
the
form
of
a
cloud
a
loom
far
out
as
though
day
were
there
at
least
the
fall
of
a
portrait
in
the
chief
s
room
once
set
him
wondering
and
melancholy
again
when
the
dog
whined
and
moped
the
skipper
eyed
the
animal
narrowly
as
though
the
creature
had
prescience
but
could
tell
us
what
it
knew
only
by
drooping
and
quivering
its
hind
quarters
you
might
have
thought
that
fate
dumb
and
cruel
but
a
little
relenting
for
something
inevitably
to
come
to
our
mishap
were
trying
to
stretch
a
point
and
so
induced
the
skipper
to
put
his
shirt
on
inside
out
one
morning
after
dreaming
he
saw
drowned
rats
in
case
the
horse
were
not
too
blind
to
see
both
the
nod
and
the
wink
the
sphinx
makes
subtle
dumb
motions
as
it
were
when
closely
regarded
i
do
not
wonder
if
it
does
sometimes
in
those
dark
days
i
thought
i
got
a
hint
or
two
i
can
not
tell
you
what
they
were
the
weather
grew
brighter
afterwards
and
i
forgot
them
from
our
narrow
and
weltering
security
where
the
wind
searched
through
us
like
the
judgment
eye
i
know
looking
out
upon
the
wilderness
in
turmoil
where
was
no
help
and
no
witness
of
our
undoing
where
the
gleams
were
fleeting
as
though
the
very
day
were
riven
and
tumbling
that
i
saw
the
filmy
shapes
of
those
things
which
darken
the
minds
of
primitives
while
the
sky
is
changeful
and
there
are
storms
at
sea
when
our
fellows
are
absent
and
mischance
and
death
are
veiled
but
here
we
shall
have
gods
and
ghosts
the
collectors
of
old
and
such
curios
may
still
keep
busy
and
tie
up
their
dry
bundles
of
mythology
and
religions
but
i
myself
could
make
plenty
more
so
it
was
my
shipmates
yarns
were
most
of
the
dire
kind
with
some
dim
warning
precedent
i
do
not
recall
a
story
that
was
gay
except
those
of
the
wanton
sort
they
were
of
close
calls
and
of
women
as
i
suppose
have
been
those
of
all
hard
livers
from
the
cave
men
on
eight
bells
were
rung
on
the
bridge
and
like
a
faint
echo
in
a
higher
pitch
answered
from
the
fo
castle
christmas
morning
by
my
pocket
compass
we
toasted
the
folk
at
home
we
had
heard
a
good
many
stories
of
wreck
this
night
and
the
chief
was
now
at
his
contribution
to
the
unseasonable
memories
i
ve
had
enough
of
it
here
goes
said
the
doctor
and
he
went
don
t
leave
us
it
lets
in
the
draught
well
the
compliments
to
you
this
had
had
four
this
one
made
me
think
it
was
she
was
a
small
steamer
that
samuel
plimsoll
and
old
but
but
her
light
nearly
went
out
in
that
blow
it
was
that
dark
you
could
find
nothing
but
the
noise
and
we
were
just
the
same
as
a
chunk
of
wood
under
a
waterfall
because
the
lord
knows
how
many
feet
of
water
were
in
the
for
she
was
rolling
so
her
fires
were
out
she
had
a
list
of
degrees
to
port
she
simply
lay
in
it
and
it
went
over
her
every
time
she
rolled
over
on
the
deep
side
thinks
i
this
is
the
last
of
her
all
this
mind
you
went
on
for
two
days
and
the
skipper
was
in
the
waiting
i
ve
found
that
when
the
danger
is
not
much
you
get
excited
but
when
there
seems
no
chance
you
get
cool
and
cunning
and
try
to
make
one
one
time
i
thought
she
seemed
easier
and
i
was
able
to
get
the
donkey
engine
going
i
felt
better
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
steam
even
though
it
was
only
in
the
donkey
thinks
i
there
s
power
and
it
s
canful
of
steam
to
a
typhoon
it
was
a
chance
to
laugh
at
then
i
took
the
other
engineers
with
me
and
we
went
below
the
water
there
full
of
cinders
and
trash
pouring
through
the
gear
as
she
turned
from
side
to
side
made
it
look
a
pretty
poor
show
you
see
the
donkey
wouldn
t
work
the
pumps
for
the
coal
and
muck
were
sucked
in
so
i
took
a
basket
and
got
into
the
tank
holding
the
basket
under
the
pump
the
water
was
up
to
my
neck
and
every
time
she
rolled
i
was
ducked
but
the
dodge
worked
and
that
list
of
hers
to
port
was
a
bit
of
luck
in
its
way
for
it
helped
us
to
get
the
starboard
boiler
going
when
i
saw
the
throws
moving
and
the
wash
angry
when
it
splashed
on
the
hot
metal
i
said
so
much
for
your
old
we
were
not
counted
out
then
we
crawled
under
the
lee
of
an
island
and
lay
for
four
days
repairing
her
the
funny
thing
was
when
we
got
to
hong
kong
the
papers
were
full
of
our
loss
samuel
plimsoll
lost
with
all
it
was
funny
to
see
a
bill
like
that
i
met
the
placard
as
it
came
running
round
a
corner
and
it
made
me
stand
and
shuffle
my
feet
on
the
ground
to
see
if
the
earth
was
all
right
i
knew
the
editor
of
that
paper
and
i
was
then
going
up
to
give
him
something
good
and
here
he
was
making
money
out
of
us
like
that
he
stood
at
the
door
of
his
office
and
saw
me
coming
i
went
up
laughing
waving
his
paper
in
my
hand
he
looked
quite
surprised
his
mouth
was
wide
open
you
re
a
nice
sort
of
chap
i
christmas
day
in
case
it
has
become
necessary
for
me
to
show
again
the
symbols
of
verity
as
this
is
a
book
of
travel
here
they
are
lat
long
light
wind
and
moderate
swell
from
vessel
rolling
heavily
at
intervals
miles
out
miles
by
engines
actual
distance
travelled
because
of
the
swell
on
our
starboard
bow
i
can
not
see
that
these
particulars
do
more
than
help
me
out
with
the
book
but
as
they
have
been
considered
essential
in
narratives
of
voyaging
here
they
are
and
much
good
may
they
do
anybody
thoreau
in
one
of
his
quaintly
superior
moods
when
speaking
of
travel
said
it
is
not
worth
while
going
round
the
world
to
count
the
cats
in
in
nearly
every
book
of
travel
this
is
proved
to
be
true
they
show
it
was
not
worth
the
while
seeing
it
was
either
to
shoot
cats
or
to
count
degrees
of
latitude
as
for
me
i
have
no
reason
whatever
for
being
at
sea
consider
arctic
travel
i
have
read
long
rows
of
books
on
that
but
recall
few
emotional
moments
the
finest
passage
in
any
book
of
arctic
travel
is
in
warburton
pikes
barren
grounds
where
he
quotes
what
the
indian
said
to
the
missionary
who
had
been
speaking
of
heaven
the
indian
asked
and
is
it
like
the
land
of
the
in
summer
when
the
mist
is
on
the
lakes
and
the
loon
cries
very
often
you
feel
at
once
that
the
country
the
indian
saw
around
him
would
be
easily
missed
by
us
even
when
in
the
midst
of
it
for
taking
the
bearings
of
such
a
land
the
sextant
and
the
miles
already
travelled
would
not
be
factors
to
help
much
now
the
indian
knew
nothing
of
artificial
horizons
and
the
aids
to
discovering
where
they
are
which
strangers
use
but
in
summer
the
mists
of
his
lakes
were
but
the
vapour
of
his
musings
the
penumbra
of
the
unfathomed
deeps
of
his
mind
whereon
he
paddled
his
own
canoe
and
when
the
called
it
was
his
memory
heard
it
was
his
thought
become
vocal
then
while
he
dreamed
on
i
myself
learned
that
the
treasures
found
in
travel
the
chance
rewards
of
travel
which
make
it
worth
while
can
not
be
accounted
beforehand
and
seldom
are
matters
a
listener
would
care
to
hear
about
afterwards
for
they
have
no
substance
they
are
no
matter
they
are
untranslatable
from
their
time
and
place
and
like
the
man
who
unwittingly
lies
down
to
sleep
on
the
tumulus
where
the
little
people
dance
on
midsummer
night
and
dreams
that
in
the
place
where
man
has
never
been
his
pockets
were
filled
with
fairy
gold
waking
to
find
pebbles
there
instead
so
the
traveller
can
not
prove
the
dreams
he
had
showing
us
only
pebbles
when
he
tries
such
fair
things
can
not
be
taken
from
the
magic
moment
they
are
but
filmy
high
in
the
ceiling
of
your
thoughts
then
rosy
and
sunlit
by
the
chance
of
the
light
transitory
melting
as
you
watch
you
come
down
to
your
lead
again
these
occasions
are
not
on
your
itinerary
they
are
like
the
indian
s
lakes
in
summer
they
have
no
names
they
can
not
be
found
on
the
best
maps
not
you
nor
any
other
will
ever
discover
them
again
nor
do
they
fill
the
hunger
which
sent
you
travelling
they
are
not
provender
for
notebooks
they
do
not
come
to
accord
with
your
mood
but
they
come
unaware
to
compel
and
it
is
your
own
adverse
and
darkling
atoms
that
are
changed
at
once
dancing
in
accord
with
the
rare
incidence
of
that
unreasonable
and
transcendent
moment
of
your
world
the
rhythm
of
which
you
feel
as
you
would
the
beat
of
drums
and
what
are
these
things
how
can
we
tell
a
strip
of
coral
beach
as
once
i
saw
it
which
was
as
all
other
coral
beaches
but
the
ship
passed
close
in
and
by
favour
of
the
hour
and
the
sun
this
strand
did
not
glare
but
was
resplendent
and
the
colours
of
the
sea
green
gold
and
purple
were
not
its
common
virtues
but
the
emotional
and
passing
attar
of
those
hues
there
was
the
long
slow
labouring
of
our
burdened
tramp
in
the
atlantic
storm
or
one
april
and
a
wild
in
blossom
by
an
english
hedge
a
white
cloud
tinctured
with
rose
and
in
it
moving
a
dozen
tropical
chaffinches
the
petals
were
on
the
grass
and
now
this
is
christmas
morning
i
am
in
the
chief
s
bunk
and
he
still
sleeps
on
the
settee
we
fell
asleep
where
we
lay
yarning
on
our
backs
after
midnight
i
wake
at
the
right
moment
opening
my
eyes
with
the
serene
and
secure
conviction
that
things
are
very
well
the
slow
rocking
of
the
ship
is
perfect
rest
there
is
no
sound
but
the
faint
of
something
loose
on
the
desk
and
responding
to
the
ship
s
movements
the
cabin
is
strangely
illuminated
to
its
deepest
corner
by
an
extraordinary
light
as
though
the
intense
glow
of
a
rare
dawn
had
penetrated
even
our
ironwork
on
the
white
top
of
the
cabin
a
bright
moon
quivers
about
the
shine
from
live
waters
sent
up
through
the
round
of
our
port
when
we
lean
over
the
port
shows
first
the
roof
of
the
alleyway
dappled
with
bright
reflections
then
a
circle
of
sky
which
the
horizon
soon
halves
and
then
the
dazzling
white
and
blue
of
the
near
waves
we
reverse
this
is
life
this
is
what
i
have
come
for
i
do
not
repose
merely
in
a
bunk
i
am
prone
and
easy
in
the
deepest
assurance
of
good
this
conviction
has
penetrated
even
the
unconsciousness
of
the
chief
he
snores
in
profound
luxury
if
in
a
ship
you
are
brought
sometimes
too
cruelly
close
to
the
scrutiny
of
the
terms
of
your
narrow
tenure
expecting
momentarily
to
see
the
document
torn
across
by
invisible
fingers
yet
nowhere
else
do
you
feel
those
terms
to
be
so
suddenly
expanded
in
the
sun
and
nowhere
else
is
got
such
release
secure
and
absolute
from
the
nudging
of
insistent
trifles
there
is
nothing
between
your
eyes
and
the
confines
of
your
own
place
empty
day
is
all
round
in
the
entire
circle
there
is
not
the
farthest
impertinent
all
the
degrees
there
is
not
one
fool
standing
in
the
light
and
you
yourself
are
on
nobody
s
horizon
no
history
stains
that
place
there
is
not
a
black
doubt
anywhere
it
is
the
first
day
again
and
no
need
yet
for
a
rubbish
heap
yet
when
singing
to
myself
i
went
outside
to
matins
i
found
sandy
our
third
engineer
with
the
toothache
so
much
of
truth
is
got
from
being
a
gymnosophist
and
regarding
your
own
toes
with
aloof
abstraction
on
a
sunny
christmas
morning
i
became
sandy
s
courage
for
him
instead
took
his
arm
firmly
and
led
him
aft
to
the
doctor
we
would
start
a
rubbish
heap
for
a
pristine
world
with
a
decayed
tooth
something
to
be
going
on
with
seeing
we
were
almost
off
madeira
we
had
some
amount
of
right
to
the
july
sun
under
which
we
had
run
for
the
first
time
since
the
mumbles
our
decks
were
quite
dry
and
cherry
red
with
rust
there
were
glittering
crusts
of
salt
in
odd
places
at
eight
bells
midday
the
captain
ordered
a
general
holiday
except
for
the
routine
duties
and
the
donkeyman
appeared
to
startle
us
as
the
apparition
of
a
stranger
on
the
ship
for
he
had
a
clean
face
though
his
eyes
still
were
dark
and
spectral
and
he
wore
a
suit
of
new
dungarees
stiff
and
creased
from
a
paper
parcel
but
just
opened
out
of
a
swansea
slop
shop
his
mates
were
some
seconds
realising
him
then
they
made
derisive
signs
and
the
boldest
some
ribald
cries
i
thought
their
resentment
was
really
aroused
by
donkey
s
new
shirt
it
was
that
touch
which
pushed
matters
too
far
and
made
him
unfriendly
he
saw
this
himself
soon
he
changed
the
new
shirt
for
one
that
had
been
rendered
neutral
in
the
and
the
bucket
there
was
something
neutral
like
donkey
s
old
shirt
about
most
of
our
crowd
each
one
of
the
mob
which
gathered
with
mess
kits
a
little
before
midday
about
the
galley
door
seemed
reduced
was
faded
in
a
noticeable
measure
from
the
sharp
and
strong
pattern
of
a
man
their
conversation
about
the
galley
was
always
in
subdued
mutterings
not
direct
but
out
of
the
mouth
corners
sideways
their
only
independence
was
in
the
negligence
of
their
attitudes
they
might
have
been
keeping
in
mind
an
austere
and
invisible
presence
whose
swift
words
from
nowhere
might
at
any
time
cleave
their
soft
babble
if
i
made
to
pass
through
them
the
babble
ceased
and
from
limp
poses
they
sprang
upright
in
the
narrow
way
to
let
me
pass
their
eyes
cast
down
a
man
who
had
not
seen
me
coming
but
still
sprawled
on
the
rail
talking
quietly
would
be
nudged
by
his
neighbour
it
struck
me
this
attitude
would
change
when
they
knew
us
better
but
it
never
did
these
deckhands
and
firemen
were
mostly
youngsters
steadied
by
a
few
older
hands
chips
and
donkey
were
the
veterans
in
that
crowd
the
boatswain
was
the
admirable
figure
he
was
a
young
britisher
tall
upright
and
weighty
with
a
smiling
respectful
eye
in
which
sometimes
i
thought
there
was
a
faint
hint
of
mockery
he
had
an
easy
balance
and
confidence
in
his
movements
which
made
him
worth
watching
when
about
his
business
clean
shaven
when
he
came
aboard
he
now
had
a
tawny
beard
which
caught
gold
lights
and
it
was
singularly
good
on
his
face
he
seldom
wore
a
cap
for
it
could
have
added
little
protection
to
the
taut
vigour
of
his
hair
and
would
have
spoilt
as
perhaps
he
himself
guessed
that
proper
flourish
and
climax
to
the
poise
of
his
head
donkey
was
an
irishman
and
he
was
the
huge
frame
of
what
maybe
thirty
years
before
had
been
a
powerful
man
this
morning
his
big
cadaverous
face
white
only
on
the
bony
ridges
surrounding
the
depressions
of
the
temples
the
cheeks
and
the
dark
pits
of
the
eyes
and
with
the
shadowy
hollow
of
the
mouth
which
gaped
through
the
weight
of
the
massive
jaw
would
have
resembled
from
a
little
distance
that
of
a
skeleton
head
of
one
of
the
monsters
in
a
geological
gallery
but
for
the
dewlap
sustained
by
sinews
running
from
his
chin
down
his
throat
donkey
was
a
silent
man
and
never
caught
your
glance
as
you
passed
him
but
lumbered
along
with
so
much
of
the
surprising
celerity
of
a
gaunt
elephant
that
you
thought
you
might
hear
the
rasp
of
his
loose
clothes
he
was
a
simple
and
docile
fellow
i
never
heard
him
speak
but
he
used
to
come
to
the
chief
fill
the
door
with
his
massive
front
his
small
eyes
which
expressed
nothing
and
were
but
sparks
of
life
looking
nowhere
in
particular
and
make
guttural
sounds
and
the
chief
being
used
to
him
understood
at
sea
donkey
did
his
small
duties
like
a
plain
but
cumbersome
mechanism
that
had
somewhere
in
it
an
obscure
point
of
rationality
when
ashore
though
he
was
said
to
go
mad
and
to
roll
trampling
and
trumpeting
through
the
squalid
littoral
of
the
world
being
brought
aboard
afterwards
an
enormity
of
lax
bones
and
flesh
with
the
cogitating
glim
in
his
bulk
quite
doused
of
the
others
there
was
a
teutonic
bunch
of
lads
deckhands
which
i
never
succeeded
in
segregating
they
looked
so
much
alike
they
had
pimpled
idle
faces
and
neutral
eyes
cast
down
when
they
sidled
by
one
thin
down
on
their
chins
and
grimy
raiment
which
by
the
look
of
it
was
an
integument
never
cast
after
we
left
port
one
name
would
have
covered
that
lot
and
frequently
i
heard
the
mates
use
it
but
olsen
the
norwegian
with
a
blond
moustache
which
covered
his
mouth
like
a
and
stern
blue
eyes
was
a
sailor
the
firemen
made
a
better
bunch
there
was
among
them
a
swarthy
brazilian
whose
constant
smile
seemed
ever
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
song
but
that
he
was
always
chewing
the
end
of
a
sweat
rag
he
wore
twisted
round
his
neck
the
happy
feature
of
our
firemen
was
a
dutchman
whose
hollow
face
was
full
of
silent
woe
and
endurance
he
was
our
chief
joy
when
once
we
found
the
sun
he
then
appeared
in
a
single
garment
trousers
and
braces
cut
in
one
piece
of
brown
canvas
hauled
up
well
under
his
arms
leaving
his
slab
feet
remote
and
forlorn
his
torso
was
bare
a
dancing
girl
in
red
and
blue
tattooed
on
his
chest
he
wore
a
bowler
hat
without
a
brim
we
will
get
christmas
over
it
was
a
pagan
festival
looking
back
at
it
i
the
astonishment
of
the
sedate
who
is
native
to
a
geometrical
suburb
where
the
morning
train
follows
the
night
and
every
numbered
house
shelters
a
moral
see
a
dancing
baccanal
with
free
gestures
who
fades
as
i
look
back
intently
doubting
my
senses
in
a
roseous
haze
the
lawless
movements
of
that
wild
bright
and
laughing
figure
its
exultant
blasphemy
its
confident
mockery
are
remembered
by
me
as
though
once
i
had
been
admitted
to
the
green
room
of
heaven
surely
i
have
seen
a
god
whose
deathless
knowledge
derides
the
solemn
gods
behind
the
curtain
it
was
christmas
night
and
our
little
capella
our
point
of
night
shine
a
star
moving
through
the
void
to
its
dark
destiny
filled
the
vault
with
its
song
while
its
fellows
in
the
heavens
stood
round
christmas
is
over
the
day
following
was
sunday
a
grey
day
of
penance
the
men
soberly
washing
their
shirts
in
buckets
under
the
forecastle
head
smoking
moody
pipes
the
garments
were
tied
to
any
convenient
gear
where
they
could
hang
free
the
sky
was
leaden
this
grey
day
was
distinguished
by
the
strange
phenomenon
of
an
horizon
which
was
almost
level
the
skyline
and
the
clouds
did
not
slant
first
this
way
then
that
the
swell
had
almost
gone
already
i
began
to
feel
the
large
patience
and
tranquillity
of
a
mind
losing
its
shadows
and
contemplating
the
light
and
space
of
a
long
voyage
in
which
the
same
men
do
the
same
things
in
the
same
place
daily
under
the
centre
of
the
empty
sky
sitting
on
a
hatch
with
the
doctor
smoking
we
confessed
with
ease
at
the
heart
and
with
minds
in
which
nervous
vibrations
had
ceased
that
we
must
have
reached
this
place
that
was
nowhere
and
that
now
time
was
not
for
us
we
had
escaped
you
all
we
were
free
there
was
not
anything
to
engage
us
there
was
nothing
to
do
and
nobody
who
wanted
us
never
before
had
i
felt
so
still
and
conscious
of
myself
i
realised
with
a
little
start
of
surprise
that
it
was
me
who
felt
the
warm
air
and
who
looked
at
the
slow
pulse
of
the
waters
and
the
fulgent
breaks
in
the
roof
and
heard
the
droning
of
the
wake
and
not
that
mere
skin
eyes
and
ears
which
as
in
london
break
in
upon
our
preoccupied
minds
with
agitating
sensations
and
i
took
in
this
world
of
ocean
and
cloudland
and
my
own
sure
identity
centred
therein
with
the
complacency
of
an
immortal
who
will
see
all
the
things
which
do
not
matter
pass
away
when
we
left
england
we
were
tense
and
sometimes
white
though
there
were
others
who
went
red
about
a
great
crisis
in
our
country
s
history
the
doctor
and
i
arrived
on
board
detached
from
the
opposing
armies
in
the
impending
conflict
and
at
first
put
our
hands
swiftly
to
our
swords
every
ten
minutes
or
so
during
meals
of
that
crisis
only
one
small
gull
now
was
left
and
he
was
following
us
astern
with
a
melancholy
cry
at
intervals
of
which
we
took
no
more
notice
and
that
gull
departed
i
see
by
my
diary
the
very
next
day
so
ended
the
great
crisis
i
did
not
even
note
the
ship
s
position
at
the
time
though
i
can
see
now
that
was
a
serious
fault
for
which
future
historians
may
blame
me
i
can
but
state
vaguely
that
it
was
about
sixty
miles
of
the
fortunate
isles
the
change
in
the
quality
of
the
sun
and
air
became
most
marked
i
remember
that
the
horizon
expanded
to
a
surprising
distance
according
to
letters
from
home
sent
about
that
date
which
i
received
long
afterwards
i
am
unable
to
find
that
similar
phenomena
were
witnessed
in
england
probably
they
were
but
local
these
manifestations
in
the
heavens
filled
the
few
of
us
privileged
to
witness
them
with
awe
and
a
new
faith
in
the
power
and
compassion
of
god
nothing
further
of
note
occurred
on
this
day
except
that
chips
as
a
further
miracle
suddenly
was
raised
whole
from
where
he
lay
in
his
bunk
with
a
useless
leg
his
leg
you
may
remember
was
damaged
in
the
gale
off
cornwall
the
doctor
going
his
rounds
was
surprised
to
find
chips
dancing
the
in
the
forecastle
and
a
stoker
with
a
cut
eye
wailing
for
a
lost
half
bottle
of
gin
taken
from
his
box
while
he
was
on
duty
thereafter
chips
returned
to
work
his
leg
becoming
halt
again
only
when
he
knew
we
saw
him
stepping
it
too
blithely
distance
run
for
past
hours
to
midday
total
distance
miles
fine
weather
glass
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
monotony
of
a
long
voyage
the
same
sky
you
know
the
same
waters
the
same
deck
and
now
i
can
see
it
should
be
added
the
same
old
self
dismayed
by
the
contemplation
of
its
features
daily
week
after
week
within
that
spacious
empty
hall
where
is
no
escape
from
the
bright
stare
overhead
which
reveals
your
baldness
and
blemishes
without
ruth
you
get
found
out
you
want
to
mix
with
the
mob
again
to
get
lost
in
the
sameness
of
your
fellows
he
who
goes
travelling
should
leave
his
self
at
home
or
as
much
of
it
as
is
not
wanted
on
the
voyage
it
is
surprising
to
find
how
little
you
want
of
yourself
the
ideal
traveller
would
venture
out
merely
as
a
disembodied
thought
or
at
most
as
an
eye
a
mere
eye
would
see
no
monotony
for
the
sky
may
be
the
same
sky
but
its
moods
are
like
those
of
the
same
woman
and
the
ocean
though
young
as
the
morning
is
older
than
never
know
what
to
expect
from
that
profound
enigma
as
for
the
sunny
deck
i
see
the
doctor
sitting
on
a
spare
spar
waiting
for
someone
to
sit
beside
him
the
chief
is
filing
a
piece
of
small
gear
outside
his
cabin
the
skipper
is
overlooking
with
a
hard
frown
a
group
of
men
busy
repairing
his
which
is
just
forward
of
the
casing
i
could
get
a
job
from
him
at
once
for
the
asking
though
i
shall
not
ask
the
first
mate
is
trying
to
be
in
three
places
at
once
the
second
mate
patrols
the
bridge
the
german
steward
who
tells
curious
stories
in
a
teutonised
dialect
of
shadwell
is
hanging
mattresses
and
bed
clothes
over
a
boom
the
men
are
chipping
and
tarring
the
deck
and
the
boatswain
wildly
bearded
a
sheath
knife
on
his
hams
looks
like
a
fine
pirate
brought
to
menial
tasks
i
have
watched
this
day
s
monotonous
sky
onwards
from
the
dawn
we
are
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
hesperides
for
some
early
hours
of
the
morning
it
was
grey
but
the
grey
roof
soon
broke
with
the
incumbent
weight
of
light
letting
sunshine
through
narrow
fractures
to
the
sea
far
out
there
were
partitions
of
thin
gold
in
the
dim
hall
the
moving
floor
was
patterned
in
day
and
night
the
low
ceiling
was
fused
where
the
day
poured
through
became
a
candent
vapour
volatilised
we
had
over
us
before
breakfast
the
ultimate
blue
where
a
few
cirrus
clouds
showed
its
great
height
then
it
was
august
the
sea
ran
in
broad
heavy
mounds
and
vitreous
which
hardly
moved
our
bulk
in
the
afternoon
the
ocean
a
short
distance
from
the
ship
grew
filmed
and
opaque
a
milky
blue
shot
with
purple
shadows
its
surface
though
heaving
was
smooth
and
flawless
no
light
entered
its
deeps
but
the
radiant
heat
was
mirrored
on
it
as
on
the
pallor
of
fluid
lava
the
water
ploughed
up
by
the
bows
did
not
break
but
rolled
over
viscidly
the
sun
dropped
behind
the
sea
about
a
point
west
of
our
course
night
was
near
yet
still
the
high
dome
with
its
circular
floor
the
sea
was
magically
illuminated
as
by
the
proximity
of
a
wonderful
presence
we
solitary
and
privileged
in
the
theatre
waited
expectant
the
doors
of
glory
were
somewhere
ajar
the
western
wall
was
clear
shining
and
empty
enclosed
by
a
proscenium
of
amber
flames
in
the
astern
of
us
were
some
high
clouds
like
a
faint
host
of
little
cherubs
and
from
their
superior
galleries
they
watched
a
light
invisible
to
us
it
made
their
faces
bright
beneath
them
the
glazed
sea
was
coral
pink
even
our
own
prosaic
iron
gear
was
sublimated
our
ship
became
lustrous
and
strange
we
were
the
argonauts
and
our
world
was
bright
with
the
veritable
of
a
world
of
romance
where
the
things
that
would
happen
were
undreamed
of
and
we
watched
for
them
from
our
argosy
s
side
calm
and
expectant
my
fellows
were
transfigured
looked
huge
were
rosy
and
awful
immortals
in
that
light
no
mortal
is
given
to
see
now
had
been
given
me
fellowship
with
the
ship
and
her
men
we
were
one
body
i
had
been
absorbed
by
our
enterprise
for
a
long
while
our
steamer
was
a
harsh
and
foreign
thing
to
me
unfriendly
to
the
eye
difficult
to
understand
but
now
she
had
become
intelligible
and
proper
she
and
her
men
were
all
my
world
and
i
could
find
my
way
about
that
world
in
the
dark
getting
used
to
a
ship
has
the
process
of
the
growth
of
a
lasting
friendship
chance
begins
it
you
regard
your
luck
askance
as
you
accept
a
new
acquaintance
with
no
joy
to
make
the
best
of
him
but
presently
to
put
the
matter
at
its
lowest
you
arrive
at
an
understanding
you
have
learned
your
friend
s
worth
familiarity
would
breed
contempt
only
in
the
you
never
have
to
account
him
afresh
or
he
is
no
comrade
there
can
be
no
surprises
again
no
encounters
with
a
stranger
in
him
his
value
at
the
least
reckoning
is
that
you
know
his
value
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
you
can
guess
with
assurance
where
his
mind
would
be
found
and
here
my
capella
has
no
strange
doors
and
startling
declivities
and
traps
for
me
any
more
i
know
her
she
is
not
exactly
all
she
should
be
but
i
apprehend
exactly
what
she
is
if
i
hurt
myself
against
her
it
is
my
own
fault
she
is
as
familiar
to
me
as
home
now
i
should
resent
any
alteration
having
learned
to
know
her
faults
i
like
her
as
she
is
the
trestle
bridge
with
its
sagging
and
wobbling
stanchions
look
out
you
when
she
rolls
which
crosses
the
main
deck
aft
on
the
port
side
from
the
amidships
section
where
i
live
to
the
poop
where
the
doctor
lives
the
two
little
streets
of
three
doors
each
to
port
and
starboard
of
her
amidships
the
doors
that
open
out
under
the
shade
of
the
boat
deck
to
sea
there
amidships
also
are
the
chief
s
room
and
the
galley
the
engineers
messroom
and
the
entrance
but
these
last
do
not
open
overside
but
look
aft
from
a
connecting
alley
which
runs
across
the
ship
to
join
the
side
alleyways
forward
of
these
cabins
is
the
casing
where
the
midship
deck
broadens
but
is
cumbered
with
bunker
hatches
mind
your
feet
at
night
there
and
beyond
again
is
the
and
over
the
the
bridge
and
the
wheelhouse
from
which
is
a
sheer
long
drop
to
the
main
deck
foreward
at
the
finish
of
that
deck
is
an
iron
wall
with
the
entrance
to
the
mysterious
forecastle
in
its
centre
and
over
that
is
the
uplifted
head
of
our
world
watching
our
course
a
bleak
windswept
place
of
rails
cable
chains
and
windlass
the
poop
has
a
timber
deck
and
there
in
fine
weather
the
deck
chairs
are
the
poop
is
a
place
needing
exact
navigation
at
night
long
boxes
enclosing
the
rudder
chains
are
on
either
side
of
it
in
the
centre
is
the
saloon
skylight
the
companion
the
steward
s
ice
chest
and
the
gear
also
there
are
two
boats
i
gained
my
night
knowledge
of
the
poop
deck
by
assault
and
retained
my
gains
with
sticking
plaster
i
am
really
proud
of
the
privilege
which
has
been
given
me
to
roam
now
this
rolling
shadow
at
night
this
little
dark
cloud
blowing
between
the
stars
and
the
deep
the
unseen
abyss
below
as
with
its
profound
reverberations
and
the
height
above
with
its
scattered
lights
as
remote
as
the
sounds
in
the
deeps
with
calm
faith
in
our
swaying
shadow
i
place
my
feet
where
nothing
shows
sure
that
my
angel
will
bear
me
up
i
put
out
my
hands
and
a
support
comes
to
them
the
pitfalls
have
ladders
for
me
and
by
touching
at
some
places
in
the
black
shadow
as
by
magic
a
lighted
and
comfortable
room
at
once
materialises
for
my
rest
in
the
void
i
think
i
liked
her
better
as
a
formless
shadow
after
sundown
whether
it
was
then
a
noise
in
my
head
my
tranquil
thoughts
murmuring
in
their
sleep
or
whether
the
sound
i
heard
was
the
deep
humming
of
the
world
s
speed
i
don
t
know
whatever
it
was
it
was
the
only
sound
our
mainmasthead
light
was
but
a
nearer
star
of
the
host
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
one
of
the
stars
so
close
i
was
within
the
luminous
porch
of
the
milky
way
it
was
midnight
in
that
silence
where
i
was
alone
in
space
adrift
on
a
night
cloud
in
the
constellations
the
stars
were
really
my
familiars
once
when
in
london
though
they
had
been
named
to
me
and
were
constant
there
they
were
far
in
the
place
to
which
one
lifts
one
s
eyes
from
the
dust
and
traffic
nothing
to
do
with
london
and
with
me
but
now
there
was
no
more
dust
and
traffic
i
was
among
them
at
last
splendid
orion
was
near
and
vast
in
his
hunting
the
pleiades
no
longer
dimmered
on
the
very
limit
of
vision
but
were
separate
points
of
delicate
light
the
night
moved
with
diamond
fire
i
was
so
far
absent
from
the
body
that
a
human
voice
beside
me
was
like
a
surprising
concussion
with
something
invisible
in
space
turning
there
was
the
glow
of
sandy
s
pipe
sandy
is
an
elderly
man
and
an
engineer
he
was
leaning
over
the
rail
cooling
after
his
watch
below
the
magic
of
the
star
shine
had
got
into
his
mind
too
he
began
with
guesses
about
the
things
which
are
not
known
parrying
doubt
with
it
s
hard
to
say
there
are
and
you
bright
young
fellers
don
t
know
everything
and
somebody
told
me
a
queer
thing
there
was
a
bright
young
feller
same
as
yourself
and
he
was
first
mate
of
the
abertawe
out
of
cardiff
jack
driscoll
was
his
name
it
was
a
funny
thing
happened
to
him
i
heard
about
it
afterwards
all
the
girls
thought
jack
driscoll
was
so
nice
one
of
the
girls
was
his
owner
s
daughter
and
she
was
the
best
of
the
bunch
anyway
for
she
was
an
only
child
and
her
father
would
have
given
her
the
earth
he
was
a
good
owner
was
her
father
as
things
go
in
cardiff
do
you
know
cardiff
well
a
little
goes
a
long
way
on
the
welsh
coast
jack
was
a
smart
sailor
with
the
first
chance
of
the
next
new
boat
if
he
watched
out
i
reckon
jack
was
a
fool
why
he
needn
t
have
gone
to
sea
any
more
but
what
did
he
do
jack
was
one
of
them
fellers
who
think
if
they
put
a
cap
saucy
over
one
ear
and
laugh
with
the
eyes
they
can
whistle
up
a
duchess
and
i
daresay
jack
could
in
summer
in
his
white
suit
when
he
d
just
shaved
he
was
a
bit
of
all
right
was
jack
he
was
a
proper
tall
lad
and
the
way
he
carried
was
a
treat
to
see
him
move
about
a
ship
his
black
hair
was
like
one
of
the
big
fiddler
chap
s
and
his
smile
would
take
in
one
of
his
pals
well
it
was
happy
days
for
jack
he
got
good
things
to
come
to
him
he
didn
t
have
to
look
for
em
like
me
and
you
he
knew
his
work
too
he
was
a
good
sailor
he
could
get
off
the
mark
at
the
first
word
like
a
bird
and
he
never
left
a
job
while
there
was
a
loose
bit
to
it
sometimes
when
there
was
nothing
doing
it
was
pretty
rotten
jack
would
say
to
be
stuck
there
in
a
welsh
tramp
with
a
crowd
of
dagoes
and
drink
coffee
essence
and
condensed
milk
out
of
a
pint
mug
and
never
go
to
a
music
hall
only
once
in
six
months
jack
reckoned
it
would
be
fine
to
be
always
in
one
of
the
liners
and
have
a
deck
like
a
skating
rink
and
a
lot
of
lady
passengers
who
wanted
a
chap
like
him
to
talk
to
them
he
could
tell
stories
too
on
the
quiet
could
jack
they
were
pretty
blue
though
sailor
stories
they
were
all
about
himself
in
the
west
coast
ports
do
you
know
the
chili
coast
well
it
s
mind
your
eye
there
and
no
half
larks
they
re
pretty
handy
with
knives
out
there
but
when
jack
was
out
for
fun
you
couldn
t
stop
him
he
was
like
all
you
young
chaps
he
wouldn
t
listen
to
sense
the
abertawe
went
light
ship
to
barry
one
trip
from
buenos
aires
and
jack
saw
her
snug
and
told
all
the
men
to
be
at
the
shipping
office
early
and
sober
in
the
morning
because
they
got
in
on
a
sunday
and
jack
saw
the
old
man
safe
on
his
way
to
cardiff
and
then
shaved
and
sang
while
he
was
shaving
he
got
himself
up
style
new
yellow
boots
and
all
and
tied
his
red
tie
spanish
fashion
and
he
went
down
the
quay
looking
for
anything
that
was
about
and
he
felt
like
the
best
man
on
the
welsh
coast
but
barry
is
a
dull
place
do
you
know
barry
well
it
s
a
town
made
out
of
odds
and
ends
stuck
down
anywhere
all
new
houses
docks
coal
tips
and
railway
sidings
and
nowhere
to
go
it
s
best
to
stay
aboard
in
barry
jack
began
to
feel
like
the
only
bird
on
a
mudbank
he
got
out
of
the
town
and
walked
along
a
road
till
he
came
to
an
old
woman
sitting
in
the
hedge
with
her
back
up
against
a
telegraph
post
her
face
was
brown
and
wrinkled
and
she
had
an
handkerchief
round
her
face
and
tied
under
her
chin
she
was
smoking
a
pipe
and
looking
at
her
blucher
boots
as
jack
came
along
she
said
tell
your
fortune
pretty
gentleman
jack
laughed
and
told
her
his
face
was
his
fortune
what
do
you
see
when
you
look
in
the
glass
said
she
now
that
was
dead
easy
to
jack
because
he
knew
as
well
as
the
girls
and
he
told
her
there
was
none
of
your
silly
modesty
about
jack
then
the
old
woman
laughed
but
i
reckon
jack
thought
she
was
only
pleased
with
him
because
he
made
it
a
point
to
make
the
mothers
and
the
grandmothers
smile
the
same
as
the
girls
what
do
you
see
in
this
glass
said
she
to
jack
she
was
fumbling
in
her
dress
and
hauls
out
a
mirror
like
you
see
in
the
shops
a
mirror
made
of
silver
and
it
had
a
frame
of
ebony
she
polished
it
on
her
skirt
and
gave
it
to
him
and
told
him
to
pass
a
bit
of
silver
with
the
other
hand
well
jack
saw
sport
and
he
could
always
pay
for
that
and
he
did
what
she
said
but
he
only
saw
himself
in
the
mirror
hi
said
jack
here
what
s
your
little
game
now
none
of
your
larks
now
he
said
or
i
ll
ask
a
policeman
what
he
can
see
in
this
tin
glass
of
you
and
your
policeman
she
said
look
now
my
dandy
boy
and
see
more
than
your
money
s
and
she
rubbed
the
glass
again
then
jack
took
another
look
it
was
a
dull
day
but
that
mirror
was
bright
with
sunshine
there
was
something
funny
about
that
mirror
he
saw
a
fine
place
in
it
all
cool
and
white
and
gold
like
you
see
out
east
it
was
a
palace
i
reckon
there
was
a
fountain
in
the
middle
and
some
girls
with
not
a
lot
on
like
some
of
the
amsterdam
postcard
girls
were
lying
around
just
anyhow
and
there
was
jack
s
own
self
among
em
and
they
were
laughing
and
talking
to
him
it
was
fine
jack
turned
his
head
just
like
you
would
do
to
see
if
the
real
place
was
behind
him
but
of
course
there
was
the
funnels
and
topmasts
of
barry
and
the
sky
looked
like
rain
i
bet
it
gave
him
a
shock
now
you
ve
seen
what
ll
be
your
luck
honey
if
you
re
not
careful
said
the
old
woman
mind
your
eye
she
said
mind
your
eye
you
with
the
saucy
face
what
s
more
she
called
after
him
don
t
you
speak
to
the
girl
with
the
odd
eyes
in
cardiff
though
i
know
you
will
and
sorry
you
ll
go
to
the
devil
said
jack
he
was
just
like
all
you
young
chaps
thought
she
was
an
artful
old
shark
who
d
got
his
money
dead
easy
that
s
what
you
always
think
if
you
don
t
understand
anything
then
there
s
nothing
in
it
you
call
in
at
the
next
pub
and
chatter
to
the
barmaid
what
happened
why
the
very
next
day
the
skipper
came
back
and
told
him
the
new
boat
was
near
ready
and
the
owner
wanted
to
see
him
jack
went
and
forgot
about
everything
except
that
he
was
going
to
be
the
handsome
boy
all
right
with
the
owner
s
own
daughter
to
look
at
him
a
pretty
girl
she
was
too
i
saw
her
once
holding
up
her
skirts
off
the
deck
while
she
looked
round
the
skipper
introduced
me
good
morning
brown
she
said
to
me
coming
out
of
the
great
western
station
at
cardiff
jack
saw
a
place
he
d
never
noticed
before
it
wasn
t
cardiff
style
it
s
a
new
place
jack
thinks
to
himself
and
a
ripping
good
place
it
looks
for
he
was
thirsty
and
there
was
plenty
of
time
it
must
have
been
run
up
since
i
was
here
last
says
jack
to
himself
though
that
s
queer
for
i
reckon
it
d
take
years
to
rig
up
a
dandy
show
of
this
but
in
he
went
he
was
surprised
when
he
got
in
and
so
would
you
have
been
it
was
like
the
place
i
saw
on
the
stage
at
london
once
it
was
in
aladdin
at
a
place
in
the
mile
end
road
you
know
what
those
things
are
like
when
the
curtain
goes
up
you
can
see
a
long
way
but
you
can
t
see
all
the
way
you
expect
something
to
happen
there
it
was
full
of
pillars
all
white
and
gold
in
a
pink
light
there
was
a
lot
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
sitting
on
sofas
full
of
cushions
talking
and
they
were
too
grand
to
even
notice
jack
as
he
stood
there
looking
round
for
a
chair
but
it
took
a
lot
to
get
on
jack
s
nerves
there
was
one
girl
in
a
white
silk
dress
with
red
roses
in
her
golden
belt
and
she
had
a
white
hat
with
red
roses
in
that
and
she
looked
like
a
summer
day
jack
was
glad
to
see
that
the
only
vacant
chair
was
at
a
table
where
she
sat
alone
of
course
over
there
goes
jack
the
place
was
as
quiet
as
a
church
before
the
service
begins
there
was
only
a
faint
whispering
he
got
to
where
the
girl
sat
as
if
she
was
waiting
for
him
she
looked
up
and
smiled
at
jack
jack
sat
down
beside
her
and
said
what
a
fine
day
it
was
she
had
a
face
the
colour
of
moonlight
and
her
eyes
were
odd
but
there
wasn
t
a
girl
who
could
make
jack
wonder
if
his
tie
was
straight
in
those
days
and
he
began
to
order
things
and
talk
once
he
took
a
look
round
leaning
back
in
his
chair
feeling
pretty
large
and
he
noticed
the
other
people
were
looking
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
as
if
he
was
talking
too
loud
but
jack
thought
he
d
jolly
well
talk
as
he
liked
and
he
d
got
just
the
best
girl
in
that
room
or
anywhere
else
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
near
twelve
o
clock
he
had
to
be
at
his
owner
s
by
one
there
was
plenty
of
time
the
drink
had
a
funny
taste
but
it
was
the
best
liquor
he
d
ever
had
he
marked
down
that
place
he
didn
t
know
there
was
a
show
like
that
in
cardiff
he
caught
hold
of
the
girl
s
hand
which
he
noticed
was
white
and
very
cold
and
pretended
he
wanted
to
look
at
her
ring
there
was
a
stone
in
the
ring
just
like
a
bit
of
soda
she
asked
him
to
try
it
on
his
own
finger
because
the
stone
changed
colour
then
but
jack
couldn
t
get
the
ring
off
till
he
d
placed
her
finger
to
his
lips
to
moisten
the
ring
he
was
the
boy
was
jack
to
see
things
didn
t
drag
along
when
he
got
the
ring
on
his
finger
the
stone
was
full
of
red
fire
so
the
time
went
but
he
forgot
all
about
time
and
the
owner
and
the
owner
s
daughter
and
everything
the
girl
s
hair
was
scented
too
and
it
was
close
to
him
presently
he
looked
up
and
saw
what
he
d
never
noticed
before
he
could
see
further
into
the
building
than
ever
there
seemed
to
be
a
garden
beyond
full
of
sunshine
and
all
the
men
and
women
were
walking
that
way
talking
loud
and
laughing
his
own
girl
got
up
too
and
said
come
along
jack
driscoll
and
he
never
even
wondered
how
she
knew
his
name
nor
why
her
face
was
like
snow
by
moonlight
nor
why
she
smiled
like
that
no
not
jack
all
he
thought
was
what
a
ripping
garden
that
was
with
palms
and
marble
courts
like
you
see
in
the
east
there
was
music
far
away
two
notes
and
a
drum
like
you
hear
in
a
native
dance
before
the
dancers
come
it
made
jack
feel
like
a
millionaire
or
a
lord
able
to
do
anything
but
just
then
only
wanting
a
good
time
then
he
noticed
they
were
alone
in
the
garden
which
was
full
of
trees
in
blossom
all
the
other
people
had
gone
there
was
only
that
music
the
place
was
very
quiet
he
could
hear
water
tinkling
in
a
fountain
and
he
reckoned
he
would
stay
there
till
closing
time
the
girl
talked
to
him
in
whispers
and
he
put
his
arm
around
her
i
don
t
know
how
long
he
stayed
there
but
he
kept
telling
the
girl
she
was
the
best
girl
he
d
ever
had
and
he
d
never
had
such
a
good
time
in
his
life
it
was
funny
the
way
he
got
out
jack
reckoned
in
there
that
the
world
would
never
come
to
an
end
like
young
fellers
do
when
they
re
enjoying
themselves
proper
but
once
he
took
her
ring
off
his
finger
to
have
another
look
at
it
then
he
was
in
the
street
again
looking
up
at
a
building
which
had
its
doors
shut
and
jack
only
thought
he
was
looking
there
for
a
number
he
wanted
it
had
started
to
rain
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
just
twelve
o
clock
he
didn
t
know
what
he
wanted
with
an
address
in
that
street
so
he
started
off
in
a
hurry
for
his
owner
s
house
feeling
pretty
stiff
as
if
he
d
been
sleeping
rough
when
he
got
to
his
owner
s
house
he
rang
the
bell
the
owner
s
daughter
came
to
the
door
and
looked
at
him
like
she
didn
t
know
him
and
was
a
bit
afraid
of
him
no
thank
you
she
said
kindly
not
and
shut
the
door
at
once
what
puzzled
jack
was
that
he
didn
t
feel
surprised
and
angry
he
turned
and
went
down
those
steps
again
and
down
the
street
thinking
it
over
he
looked
back
at
the
house
yes
that
was
the
house
all
right
and
that
was
annie
all
right
well
what
the
devil
was
the
matter
with
him
there
was
a
at
the
corner
and
he
stopped
there
thinking
things
over
and
staring
at
the
window
then
he
saw
his
face
in
a
mirror
and
shouted
so
that
the
barman
came
and
ordered
him
out
of
that
sharp
now
but
he
kept
looking
at
the
glass
not
believing
his
eyes
he
knew
his
own
face
again
but
only
just
knew
it
his
eyes
were
dull
and
red
and
gummy
same
as
those
old
men
have
who
ve
lived
too
long
and
his
face
was
puffed
and
pimpled
and
he
had
a
lousy
white
ii
december
lat
long
course
west
we
are
nearing
the
tropics
now
the
ship
has
such
a
complete
set
of
grumblers
good
fellows
who
know
their
work
better
than
anyone
less
than
god
that
our
great
distance
at
sea
is
plain
our
men
casually
gathered
and
speaking
divers
tongues
detached
from
earth
and
set
afloat
on
a
mobile
islet
to
mix
on
it
if
they
can
have
become
one
body
to
deal
with
the
common
enemy
we
are
corporate
to
face
each
trouble
as
it
meets
us
and
free
to
explain
afterwards
how
much
better
we
should
have
done
under
another
captain
the
skipper
knows
this
broad
spirit
now
possesses
us
and
so
is
contented
and
blithe
wearing
only
on
deck
that
weary
look
which
is
the
sober
badge
of
high
office
as
though
he
were
an
unfortunate
man
to
have
us
about
him
we
being
what
we
are
but
that
he
would
do
his
best
with
the
fools
seeing
we
are
in
his
charge
this
morning
at
six
hearing
the
men
at
the
hosepipes
giving
the
decks
their
daily
wash
i
tumbled
out
for
a
cold
tub
this
is
a
simple
affair
you
leave
the
cabin
with
a
towel
about
you
stand
in
a
clear
space
and
rotate
before
the
hydrant
to
general
cheering
a
hot
bath
on
the
capella
is
not
so
easy
because
although
there
is
a
aboard
it
has
become
a
paint
locker
one
must
descend
into
the
after
warning
the
engineer
on
duty
who
then
will
have
ready
a
barrel
filled
from
the
boilers
the
ingenious
man
will
fix
a
shower
bath
also
this
is
a
perforated
meat
tin
hanging
from
a
grating
above
the
tub
and
connected
with
a
pump
after
a
hot
bath
in
the
where
the
temperature
was
often
well
over
that
shower
of
cold
sea
water
would
strike
loud
cries
from
any
man
whose
was
uncertain
this
morning
was
the
right
prelude
to
the
tropics
this
was
the
morning
when
if
our
planet
had
been
till
then
untenanted
a
world
unconsummated
and
waiting
approval
the
divine
approval
would
have
come
and
a
child
would
have
been
born
an
immortal
the
offspring
of
aurora
and
the
sea
god
and
lusty
with
eyes
as
bright
as
joy
and
a
rosy
body
to
be
kissed
from
toes
to
crown
the
dancing
light
and
the
warm
shower
suddenly
born
alive
in
it
from
one
ripe
cloud
the
golden
air
the
waves
of
the
trades
the
seas
of
the
world
in
the
first
dawn
moving
along
like
a
multitude
released
to
play
their
blue
passionate
and
profound
their
crests
innocent
and
dazzling
made
me
think
i
might
hear
faint
cheering
if
i
listened
intently
in
the
west
was
a
steep
range
of
cloudland
rising
from
the
sea
and
against
it
was
inclined
the
flame
of
a
rainbow
there
was
that
rainbow
as
constant
as
the
pennant
hoisted
over
an
uplighted
occasion
the
world
s
noble
emblem
was
aloft
i
demanded
of
the
skipper
if
he
would
run
up
our
ensign
in
reply
to
it
but
he
only
peered
at
me
curiously
the
heat
increased
with
the
day
we
had
run
well
down
from
the
bleak
apex
of
the
world
with
its
nimbus
of
fogs
here
was
the
entrance
to
the
place
where
our
youthful
dreams
began
i
recognised
it
every
feature
was
as
we
both
have
seen
it
from
afar
across
the
roofs
from
our
outlook
in
the
arid
city
when
the
path
to
it
had
appeared
as
hopeless
to
our
feet
as
the
path
to
the
moon
this
pioneer
can
assure
his
fellows
whose
bright
illusions
grow
fainter
with
age
that
their
dreams
must
be
followed
up
to
be
reached
at
midday
we
began
to
cast
clothes
as
to
the
afternoon
of
that
i
remember
the
less
there
was
the
chief
s
empty
bunk
so
much
more
alluring
than
my
own
into
that
i
climbed
my
mind
steeled
against
drowsy
weakness
i
would
digest
my
dinner
with
a
book
eyes
sternly
alert
the
capella
rocked
slowly
a
big
cradle
my
body
was
lax
and
responsive
there
was
about
us
the
silent
emptiness
which
is
far
from
the
centres
where
many
men
believe
it
is
necessary
to
get
lots
of
things
done
the
chief
suspired
on
his
settee
the
waves
were
singing
to
themselves
a
ray
of
light
laughed
in
my
eyes
playing
hide
and
seek
across
the
wisdom
of
my
book
i
put
the
book
down
as
you
know
where
i
had
come
from
we
do
not
dare
to
sleep
during
daylight
without
first
arguing
with
the
conscience
which
usually
we
fail
to
convince
this
comes
of
our
mental
trick
which
takes
a
pleasure
we
wholly
desire
and
puts
on
it
a
prohibitive
label
you
understand
softening
of
the
character
courage
brothers
do
not
stumble
the
solemn
forefinger
wags
gravely
in
our
faces
before
i
fell
asleep
my
habit
born
of
the
hard
grey
weather
which
makes
an
englishman
hard
and
prosperous
did
come
with
its
admonitory
forefinger
remembering
that
i
was
secure
in
a
sunnier
world
i
cried
out
with
ribald
mockery
across
the
abyss
i
had
safely
crossed
knowing
my
old
self
could
not
follow
and
shut
my
eyes
happily
and
also
let
me
up
again
with
an
urgent
afterthought
which
i
must
get
rid
of
before
i
this
were
not
a
plain
narrative
of
travel
without
any
wise
asides
i
would
get
off
the
capella
here
to
argue
that
what
all
you
fellows
want
in
the
place
i
have
luckily
left
is
not
more
in
which
wan
virtue
you
have
long
shown
yourselves
to
be
so
proficient
that
our
awards
for
your
merit
have
overcrowded
the
workhouses
but
more
rollicking
and
a
ruddy
and
bright
eyed
insistence
on
the
means
to
it
look
at
me
now
in
this
bunk
not
since
i
was
last
in
a
cradle
have
i
felt
the
world
would
buoy
me
up
if
i
dared
to
shut
my
eyes
to
affairs
while
the
sun
was
shining
but
i
am
going
to
try
it
again
now
and
risk
my
future
i
repeat
i
would
argue
this
with
you
only
i
want
to
sleep
it
is
worth
recording
that
when
i
awoke
i
found
nothing
had
happened
to
me
except
benefit
the
venture
can
be
made
safely
others
had
kept
the
course
for
me
the
ship
had
not
stopped
through
the
door
i
could
see
a
blackened
and
sweating
stoker
who
had
been
keeping
the
fires
while
i
slept
and
he
was
getting
back
his
breath
in
loud
sobs
something
had
made
him
sick
these
stupid
and
dirty
men
will
drink
too
much
while
they
are
attending
to
the
furnaces
they
have
been
warned
of
the
danger
of
which
they
take
no
heed
and
so
they
have
to
suffer
on
the
poop
was
the
second
officer
busy
in
the
hot
sun
with
a
gang
overhauling
a
boat
and
i
found
on
enquiry
that
a
man
was
still
at
the
wheel
so
thereafter
while
in
the
land
of
the
constant
sun
i
slept
every
afternoon
and
was
never
a
penny
the
worse
somehow
you
know
things
went
on
i
think
i
shall
become
one
of
the
intelligent
leisured
class
it
was
within
an
hour
of
midnight
the
moon
had
set
i
was
idling
amidships
about
the
ship
s
shadowy
structure
when
i
was
asked
to
take
charge
of
the
bridge
till
eight
bells
the
second
mate
was
ill
and
the
first
mate
was
asleep
through
overwork
the
skipper
said
he
would
not
keep
me
up
there
long
i
had
but
to
call
if
a
light
came
into
view
and
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
wheelhouse
ah
but
it
is
long
since
i
played
at
ships
and
was
a
pirate
captain
i
remembered
there
are
dull
folk
who
wonder
what
it
feels
like
to
be
a
king
the
king
does
not
know
ask
the
small
boy
who
is
surprised
with
an
order
to
hold
a
horse
s
head
i
took
my
promotion
mounting
the
steep
ladder
to
the
open
height
in
the
night
i
felt
then
i
was
more
than
sundered
from
my
kind
i
had
been
taken
and
placed
remotely
from
the
comfort
of
the
capella
s
isolated
community
also
there
was
me
and
there
were
the
stars
they
were
my
nearest
neighbours
i
stood
for
you
among
them
alone
when
the
last
man
hears
but
does
not
see
the
deep
waters
of
this
dark
sphere
in
that
night
to
which
there
shall
be
no
morning
sun
he
shall
know
what
was
my
sensation
aloft
in
the
saddle
of
the
capella
the
only
inhabitant
of
a
congealed
asteroid
off
the
main
track
in
space
with
the
sun
diminished
to
a
point
through
travel
and
the
milky
way
not
reached
yet
though
i
could
see
we
were
approaching
its
bay
of
light
an
appreciable
journey
had
been
made
but
by
the
faintness
of
its
shine
there
was
a
timeless
vacancy
to
be
travelled
still
we
should
make
that
faint
glow
that
congregation
of
suns
that
archipelago
of
worlds
though
not
yet
but
had
we
not
all
the
night
to
travel
in
the
night
would
be
long
we
should
not
be
disrupted
any
more
by
the
old
day
the
final
morning
had
passed
i
had
no
doubt
the
drift
of
the
dark
lump
to
which
i
clung
in
space
while
my
hair
streamed
with
our
speed
would
at
length
reach
the
bright
fraternity
no
more
than
a
dimmer
of
removed
promise
though
it
seemed
a
bell
rang
beside
me
in
the
night
it
was
answered
at
once
from
somewhere
ahead
others
then
were
journeying
with
me
the
void
was
peopled
though
the
travellers
were
all
invisible
and
i
heard
a
confident
voice
call
lights
are
burning
the
lights
were
i
could
see
that
but
when
the
profundities
are
about
you
and
you
think
you
are
alone
in
outer
night
that
is
the
kind
of
word
to
hear
joyously
i
shouted
into
what
seemed
to
be
boundless
nothing
all
right
one
dayfall
we
saw
the
canary
islands
a
great
distance
on
the
port
beam
i
do
not
know
which
day
it
was
the
hesperides
were
as
blurred
as
the
place
in
the
calendar
the
days
had
run
together
into
a
measureless
sense
of
we
had
passed
the
last
of
the
trivial
allotments
of
time
the
islands
loomed
and
i
wondered
whether
that
land
was
the
hint
of
something
in
a
past
life
which
the
memory
saw
but
could
not
shape
whatever
was
there
it
was
too
long
forgotten
that
apparition
which
a
whisper
told
me
was
land
faded
as
i
gazed
at
it
overseas
lazily
trying
to
remember
what
it
once
meant
it
was
gone
again
it
was
no
matter
now
perhaps
i
was
deceiving
myself
perhaps
i
had
had
no
other
life
this
capella
always
under
the
height
of
a
blue
dome
always
the
centre
of
a
circular
floor
of
waters
waters
to
be
seen
beating
against
the
steep
and
luminous
walls
encompassing
us
though
nowhere
finding
an
outlet
was
all
my
experience
i
could
recall
only
the
faintest
shadows
of
a
past
into
that
limpid
present
i
could
see
nothing
clearly
that
was
not
confined
within
the
dark
faultless
line
where
the
sky
was
inseparably
annealed
to
the
sea
here
i
had
been
always
all
i
knew
was
this
length
of
sheltered
deck
and
those
doors
behind
me
where
i
leaned
on
a
rail
between
the
stanchions
doors
which
sheltered
a
few
familiars
with
their
clothes
on
hooks
their
pipe
racks
and
photographs
of
women
a
length
of
deck
finishing
on
either
hand
in
two
iron
ladders
the
ladder
forward
just
past
the
radiation
and
coal
grit
by
the
casing
descending
to
a
broad
walk
which
led
to
the
forecastle
head
that
bare
outlook
always
at
a
difference
with
the
horizon
and
the
ladder
aft
going
down
to
another
broad
walk
sticky
with
new
tar
where
the
bulwarks
were
as
high
as
the
breast
and
tinker
the
dog
glad
of
a
word
from
you
trotted
about
the
rusty
winches
and
around
the
hatches
and
that
walk
aft
finished
in
the
door
of
the
alleyway
opening
upon
the
asylum
of
the
doctor
s
cabin
and
the
saloon
the
skipper
s
sanctum
and
the
domain
of
the
friendly
steward
there
was
the
smell
of
the
cargo
drawing
from
the
ventilators
on
the
deck
when
you
went
by
their
trumpet
mouths
there
was
the
warm
oily
gush
of
air
from
the
entrance
and
in
the
saloon
alleyway
i
used
to
think
the
store
of
potatoes
right
behind
was
generating
gases
but
nobody
knows
every
origin
of
the
marine
smells
well
here
were
all
the
things
my
senses
apprehended
i
could
walk
round
my
universe
in
five
minutes
and
when
i
had
finished
i
could
do
it
again
here
i
had
been
always
nothing
could
be
clearer
than
that
looking
out
from
my
immediate
circumstances
i
saw
no
entrance
to
the
place
where
we
were
rocking
the
place
where
the
capella
was
alone
the
walls
of
the
enclosure
were
flawless
there
was
not
a
door
through
them
anywhere
there
was
not
a
rift
in
the
precision
of
the
dark
circle
about
us
where
one
could
crawl
out
between
the
sky
and
the
sea
there
we
indubitably
were
though
and
i
dwelt
constantly
on
the
miracle
of
that
lucky
existence
i
could
not
doubt
that
we
were
there
yet
how
had
we
got
there
i
leave
that
to
the
metaphysicians
there
we
were
and
no
man
who
merely
trusted
his
experience
could
explain
our
presence
there
was
some
evidence
to
my
simple
mind
that
such
a
life
in
such
surroundings
perchance
was
the
gift
of
the
gods
and
that
we
could
never
get
any
nearer
the
limits
of
the
world
in
which
we
had
been
placed
to
see
what
was
beyond
could
never
approach
that
enclosure
of
blue
walls
where
the
distant
waves
which
beat
against
them
could
not
get
out
morning
after
morning
i
watched
them
the
dark
leaping
shapes
of
the
far
rebels
mounting
their
prison
at
its
base
and
collapsing
beaten
the
seas
never
changed
they
followed
us
and
the
wind
a
living
host
the
blue
of
their
slopes
and
hollows
as
deep
as
ecstasy
their
crests
white
and
lambent
they
were
buoyant
they
were
leisurely
they
were
the
right
companions
of
travel
they
just
kept
pace
with
us
they
ran
after
us
like
happy
children
as
though
they
had
been
lagging
they
came
abeam
to
turn
up
to
us
their
shining
faces
calling
to
us
musically
then
dropping
behind
again
in
silence
when
i
looked
overside
into
the
pellucid
depths
peering
below
the
surface
in
long
forgetfulness
leaving
the
body
and
gliding
the
mind
in
that
palpable
and
hyacinthine
air
beneath
us
where
the
sunken
foam
dimmered
in
pale
clouds
i
felt
myself
not
afloat
but
hovering
in
the
midst
of
a
hollow
sphere
filled
with
light
the
blue
water
was
only
a
heavier
and
a
darker
air
i
had
no
weight
there
i
was
only
a
quiet
thought
tinctured
with
the
royal
colour
of
the
space
wherein
i
drifted
the
upper
half
of
the
sphere
was
blue
also
but
of
a
different
blue
the
rarer
and
more
volatile
ether
was
above
us
the
sea
was
its
essence
and
precipitate
the
sea
colour
was
profound
and
satisfying
but
the
colour
of
the
sky
was
diffused
as
though
the
heaven
were
an
idea
which
was
beyond
you
which
you
stood
regarding
and
azure
were
it
symbol
and
that
by
concentration
you
might
fathom
its
meaning
but
i
can
report
no
luck
from
my
concentrated
efforts
on
that
symbol
the
colour
may
have
been
its
own
reward
every
morning
after
breakfast
the
skipper
and
the
doctor
made
a
visit
to
the
forecastle
then
after
the
doctor
had
carefully
searched
his
dress
for
insects
we
spent
the
day
together
we
mounted
the
forecastle
to
begin
with
watching
the
acre
of
dazzling
foam
which
the
capella
s
bows
broke
around
us
out
of
that
the
flying
fish
would
get
up
just
under
us
to
go
skimming
off
flights
of
silver
locusts
this
reminded
the
surgeon
that
we
might
try
for
albacore
and
bonito
which
would
be
a
change
from
tinned
mutton
the
skipper
found
a
long
fir
pole
to
which
was
attached
sixty
fathoms
of
line
with
a
large
hook
which
we
covered
with
a
white
rag
lapping
a
cutting
of
tin
round
the
shank
when
this
object
was
dropped
over
the
stern
in
its
leaps
from
wave
to
wave
it
bore
a
distant
resemblance
to
a
flying
fish
the
weight
of
the
trailing
line
breaking
a
cord
frequently
gave
us
false
alarms
and
long
tiring
hauls
but
on
the
second
day
the
scaffold
pole
vibrated
to
some
purpose
and
we
knew
we
were
hauling
in
more
than
the
bait
we
got
aboard
a
coryphene
the
dolphin
of
the
sailors
it
gave
us
in
its
death
agony
the
famous
display
beautiful
but
rather
painful
to
watch
for
the
wonderful
hues
as
they
changed
stayed
in
the
eye
and
sent
to
the
mind
only
a
message
of
a
creature
in
a
violent
death
struggle
the
contours
of
this
predatory
fish
express
extraordinary
speed
and
power
and
its
armed
mouth
has
been
upturned
by
providence
the
better
to
catch
the
flying
fish
as
they
drop
back
to
sea
after
an
effort
to
escape
from
it
but
providence
or
evolution
had
never
taught
the
coryphene
that
there
are
times
when
the
little
flying
fish
as
it
falls
back
exhausted
may
be
a
rag
of
white
shirt
and
a
scrap
of
bright
tin
ware
with
a
large
hook
in
its
deceptive
little
belly
so
there
the
dolphin
was
glowing
and
fading
with
the
hues
of
faery
its
life
really
illuminating
it
from
within
as
its
life
ebbed
or
strove
convulsively
its
colours
waned
and
pulsed
it
was
gold
when
it
came
on
board
and
darkened
to
ultramarine
as
it
thrashed
the
deck
and
its
broad
dorsal
fin
showed
violet
eyes
its
body
changed
to
a
pale
metallic
green
and
then
its
light
went
out
now
as
i
look
back
upon
the
capella
and
her
company
as
they
were
in
that
period
of
our
adventure
when
our
place
was
but
somewhere
in
between
senegambia
and
trinidad
i
see
us
but
indifferently
for
we
are
mellowed
in
that
haze
in
which
retrospection
just
discerns
those
affairs
long
since
accomplished
that
were
not
altogether
wearisome
it
is
better
to
go
to
my
log
again
for
there
the
matter
was
noted
by
the
stub
of
a
pencil
at
the
very
time
and
when
unless
a
beautiful
mist
was
seen
it
had
not
the
remotest
chance
of
being
recorded
when
i
turn
to
the
diary
for
further
evidence
of
those
days
of
blue
and
gold
in
the
trades
its
faithfulness
is
seen
at
once
a
grey
day
the
sun
fitful
wind
and
seas
on
the
port
quarter
and
the
large
following
billows
occasionally
lopping
inboard
as
she
rolled
the
decks
therefore
are
sloppy
again
we
had
a
sharp
reminder
at
six
bells
that
we
are
not
bound
to
any
health
resort
as
sandy
put
it
we
were
told
to
go
aft
where
the
doctor
would
give
each
of
us
five
grains
of
quinine
this
is
to
be
a
daily
rite
to
encourage
the
men
to
take
the
quinine
it
is
to
be
given
to
them
in
gin
being
foreigners
they
did
not
understand
the
advice
about
the
quinine
but
they
caught
the
word
gin
quite
well
and
they
were
outside
the
saloon
alleyway
a
smiling
queue
at
the
stroke
of
eleven
i
went
along
to
see
the
harsh
truth
dawn
on
them
the
first
man
was
a
big
german
deckhand
he
took
the
glass
from
the
doctor
his
shy
and
puzzled
smile
at
this
unexpected
charity
from
the
skipper
dissolved
instantly
when
the
quinine
got
behind
it
his
eyes
opened
and
stared
at
nothing
to
the
surprise
of
his
fellows
he
turned
violently
to
the
ship
s
side
rested
his
hands
on
it
and
spat
spat
carefully
continuously
and
with
grave
deliberation
distance
run
since
noon
yesterday
miles
actual
knots
total
distance
miles
there
was
not
a
living
thing
in
sight
not
even
a
flying
fish
the
night
is
fine
and
starlit
the
milky
way
a
brilliant
arch
from
east
to
west
under
which
we
are
steaming
when
venus
rose
she
was
a
tiny
moon
so
refulgent
that
she
gave
a
faint
pallor
to
a
large
area
of
sky
outlined
the
coast
of
a
cloud
and
made
a
broad
shining
path
on
the
sea
the
moon
rose
after
nine
veiled
in
filmy
air
peeping
motionless
at
the
edge
of
a
black
curtain
the
moon
later
was
quite
obscured
and
the
steamer
ceased
to
exist
except
where
in
my
heated
cabin
the
smoky
oil
lamp
showed
me
my
dismal
cubicle
i
went
in
and
sat
on
the
mate
s
sea
chest
the
mate
was
on
duty
on
the
washstand
was
his
mug
of
cocoa
and
on
top
of
the
mug
two
thick
sandwiches
of
bread
and
meat
that
food
was
black
with
cockroaches
the
oil
lamp
stank
but
gave
little
light
the
engines
were
throbbing
and
out
of
the
open
door
i
saw
the
gleam
of
the
wash
and
heard
its
harassing
note
i
could
not
read
i
loathed
the
idea
of
getting
into
the
hot
bunk
and
lying
there
stewing
a
clear
keen
clangour
of
thoughts
making
sleep
impossible
the
mate
appeared
drove
off
the
cockroaches
cheerfully
examined
the
sandwiches
for
inconspicuous
deer
opening
each
to
make
sure
and
then
muffled
himself
with
one
my
god
i
could
have
killed
him
with
these
two
hands
what
right
had
he
to
be
cheerful
but
he
is
such
a
boy
and
to
break
that
unconsciously
happy
smile
of
his
would
be
sacrilege
besides
he
began
to
tell
me
about
his
sweetheart
her
portrait
hangs
in
our
cabin
it
is
an
enlargement
you
pay
for
the
frame
and
the
photographer
overjoyed
i
suppose
gives
you
the
enlargement
i
prefer
the
second
engineer
s
who
are
in
colours
and
are
dutch
picture
postcards
and
cuttings
from
french
comic
papers
and
he
calls
them
his
recollections
of
sundays
at
home
i
listened
patient
and
kind
to
the
second
mate
s
reminiscences
of
rapturous
evening
walks
under
the
lamps
of
swansea
with
this
girl
in
the
doubt
it
eased
his
heart
to
tell
i
could
have
howled
aloud
like
the
dog
who
hears
music
at
night
then
i
broke
away
and
ran
to
the
chief
s
cabin
for
sanctuary
the
chief
was
making
an
abstract
and
was
searching
through
his
log
for
ten
tons
of
coal
which
were
missing
in
the
hunt
for
the
lost
coal
i
lost
myself
i
grew
excited
wherever
a
thick
bush
of
figures
promised
the
hidden
quarry
and
in
an
hour
s
search
found
the
strayed
tons
in
hiding
at
the
bottom
of
a
column
they
had
been
left
there
and
not
transported
into
the
next
again
the
dread
of
that
bunk
had
to
be
faced
and
dealt
with
i
stood
at
the
chief
s
door
knocking
out
my
pipe
looking
astern
into
the
night
looking
to
where
our
celestial
familiar
of
home
was
low
down
and
preparing
to
leave
us
altogether
to
the
strange
and
perhaps
unlucky
gods
of
other
skies
o
the
nights
at
sea
wakened
with
my
heart
jumping
because
of
a
devastating
sound
without
in
the
early
morning
tinker
was
being
thrashed
by
the
old
man
for
eating
the
saloon
mats
when
at
the
men
congregated
amidships
with
their
tins
for
dinner
the
sun
was
a
near
furnace
and
the
breeze
a
balm
the
white
of
the
ship
is
now
a
glare
and
the
sea
foam
can
not
be
looked
at
donkey
lumbered
out
of
his
place
where
he
attends
to
the
minor
boiler
his
face
the
colour
of
putty
and
held
to
a
rail
gazing
out
with
dead
eyes
overside
gasping
he
declared
he
couldn
t
stick
his
job
the
flying
fish
are
getting
up
in
flights
all
day
long
i
saw
one
fish
go
a
distance
of
about
fifty
yards
in
a
making
a
bight
in
the
direction
of
the
wind
we
caught
another
large
coryphene
and
had
him
in
steaks
for
tea
he
was
much
better
cooked
than
the
last
which
had
the
texture
of
white
wool
and
to
increase
our
happiness
the
cook
had
not
given
us
sour
bread
at
midday
we
were
and
i
had
a
lonely
evening
with
the
chief
this
is
new
year
s
eve
we
talked
of
the
east
india
dock
road
and
of
much
else
in
london
town
at
eight
bells
when
we
held
up
our
glasses
in
the
direction
of
polaris
the
moon
was
bright
and
the
waters
hushed
then
we
took
each
a
hurricane
lamp
and
went
about
the
decks
collecting
flying
fish
for
breakfast
finding
a
dozen
of
them
the
uplifted
splendour
of
these
days
persists
but
the
splendour
sags
now
a
little
at
midday
with
the
weight
of
the
heat
the
poop
deck
is
now
sheltered
with
an
awning
and
lying
there
in
lazy
chairs
with
a
wind
following
and
barely
overtaking
us
idly
watching
the
shadows
of
the
overhead
gear
move
on
the
bright
awning
as
the
ship
rolls
is
to
get
caught
in
the
toils
of
the
droning
wake
and
to
sleep
before
you
know
you
are
a
prisoner
the
wake
itself
in
these
seas
when
the
sun
is
on
it
a
broad
road
going
home
straight
and
white
over
the
hills
the
road
which
is
not
for
us
is
one
of
the
good
things
of
the
voyage
straight
beneath
the
rail
the
wake
is
an
upheaval
of
gems
sapphires
emeralds
and
diamonds
always
instantly
melting
in
the
sun
always
fusing
and
fleeting
in
swift
coils
of
malachite
and
chrysoprase
but
never
gone
as
you
watch
that
coloured
turmoil
it
draws
your
mind
from
your
body
you
feel
your
careless
gaze
snatched
in
the
revolving
hues
speeding
astern
and
your
consciousness
is
instantly
unwound
from
your
spinning
brain
and
you
are
left
standing
on
the
ship
an
empty
spool
under
the
awning
at
night
to
the
doctor
and
to
me
the
first
mate
played
his
accordion
he
is
a
little
welshman
this
mate
with
a
childish
nose
and
a
brutish
moustache
and
in
his
face
is
blended
a
girlish
innocence
of
large
affairs
and
the
hirsute
nature
of
the
adult
male
animal
a
nature
he
relieves
on
the
capella
with
bawdy
talk
and
guffaws
he
played
come
birdie
come
and
things
like
that
and
then
told
us
some
monte
videan
stories
as
they
were
true
stories
about
himself
and
other
young
sailors
they
ought
really
to
be
included
in
a
faithful
diary
of
a
sea
voyage
yet
as
i
can
not
reproduce
the
doctor
s
antiseptic
judgment
of
which
i
know
nothing
but
the
glow
of
his
pipe
in
the
unresponding
dark
at
the
end
of
the
last
titter
of
the
mate
had
died
is
better
to
leave
this
matter
alone
the
hottest
day
we
have
had
i
descended
at
midday
to
the
engines
to
see
sandy
at
work
with
his
shining
giants
standing
on
the
middle
platform
while
he
was
shouting
his
greetings
to
me
over
the
uproar
i
felt
the
heat
of
the
grating
through
my
boot
soles
and
shifted
the
temperature
there
was
sandy
was
but
in
his
drawers
and
a
pair
of
old
boots
and
the
tongues
of
the
boots
properly
were
hanging
out
his
noble
torso
was
glistening
with
moisture
and
as
i
talked
energetically
vaulting
my
words
above
the
roar
of
the
crank
throws
in
that
hot
and
oleaginous
place
the
perspiration
began
a
sudden
drop
from
my
own
face
and
hands
and
in
a
copious
way
which
startled
me
for
a
time
i
had
some
difficulty
in
breathing
as
though
in
a
vacuum
but
gradually
forgot
this
danger
of
suffocation
in
the
love
of
the
artist
sandy
showed
while
offering
me
the
spectacle
of
his
i
think
i
understood
him
at
first
one
would
see
no
order
in
that
haze
of
rioting
steel
the
massive
metal
waves
of
the
shaft
were
walloping
and
plunging
in
their
pits
with
an
astonishing
alacrity
about
fifteen
tons
of
polished
steel
were
moving
with
swift
and
somewhat
awful
desperation
the
big
room
shook
and
hummed
with
the
vigour
of
it
but
order
came
as
sandy
talked
and
presently
i
found
the
continuous
thunder
that
deadening
bass
of
the
crank
throws
seemed
to
lessen
as
we
conversed
sitting
together
on
a
tool
chest
our
voices
easily
penetrated
it
and
listening
more
attentively
at
length
i
found
what
sandy
said
was
true
that
each
tossing
and
circling
part
of
the
could
be
heard
contributing
its
strident
or
profound
note
to
the
chorus
and
each
became
constant
and
expected
a
singing
personality
which
was
heard
through
the
others
whenever
listened
for
above
all
at
regular
intervals
a
rod
rang
clear
like
the
bell
in
parsifal
yet
curiously
enough
sandy
declared
he
could
not
catch
that
note
though
it
tolled
clear
and
resonant
enough
in
my
ears
the
skylight
was
so
far
above
us
that
we
got
little
daylight
hanging
from
the
gratings
in
a
few
places
some
black
iron
pots
shaped
like
kettles
had
cotton
rags
in
their
spouts
and
were
giving
us
oil
flares
instead
the
terrific
unremitting
energy
of
the
ponderous
arms
moving
thunderously
and
still
with
a
speed
which
made
tons
as
aery
as
flashes
of
light
and
sandy
in
the
midst
of
it
quick
in
nothing
but
his
eyes
moving
about
his
raging
but
tethered
monsters
and
casual
rubbing
his
hands
on
a
pull
of
cotton
waste
putting
his
ear
down
to
listen
attentively
at
a
bearing
his
face
turned
from
a
steel
fist
which
flung
violently
at
his
head
missed
him
and
withdrew
to
shoot
at
him
again
gave
me
the
first
distinct
feeling
that
our
enterprise
had
its
purpose
powerfully
energised
and
cunningly
directed
i
felt
as
i
watched
the
dance
of
the
eccentrics
and
the
connecting
rods
that
our
ship
was
getting
along
famously
i
think
i
detected
in
sandy
himself
a
faint
contempt
for
the
chap
at
the
upper
end
of
the
telegraph
i
stayed
two
hours
and
then
my
shirt
was
as
though
i
had
been
overboard
and
ascending
a
greasy
and
almost
perpendicular
series
of
ladders
to
the
upper
world
i
discovered
from
the
drag
of
my
feet
and
the
weight
of
my
body
that
i
had
had
just
as
much
of
an
engineer
s
watch
in
the
tropics
as
i
could
stand
there
was
a
burst
of
cool
light
the
tumult
ceased
and
again
there
was
the
old
capella
rocking
in
the
singing
seas
for
ever
under
the
tranquil
clouds
we
had
stopped
again
a
moderate
wind
and
sea
and
a
bright
morning
but
far
out
a
dark
cloud
formed
and
drew
and
driving
towards
us
covered
us
presently
with
a
canopy
the
warm
torrent
fell
with
outrageous
violence
and
for
all
we
could
see
of
our
way
the
capella
might
have
been
in
a
dense
fog
the
mosquito
curtains
were
served
out
and
we
amused
ourselves
draping
our
bunks
later
the
weather
cleared
the
night
was
stiflingly
hot
and
in
that
reeking
bunk
with
an
iron
bulkhead
separating
me
from
the
engine
room
it
was
like
lying
on
the
shelf
of
an
oven
though
wide
open
on
its
catch
the
door
admitted
no
air
but
did
allow
a
miserable
as
the
ship
rolled
at
eleven
o
clock
a
pale
face
floated
in
the
black
vacancy
of
the
door
and
i
could
see
the
doctor
peering
in
to
find
if
i
were
awake
i
say
purser
i
can
t
sleep
will
you
come
and
have
a
gossip
old
dear
we
went
aft
in
our
pyjamas
the
doctor
cleared
away
bottles
and
things
from
his
settee
and
we
disembarked
from
the
capella
visiting
other
and
distant
stars
returning
to
our
own
again
not
before
three
next
morning
we
seem
to
have
got
to
a
dead
end
of
the
trade
winds
the
heat
of
the
forenoon
was
oppressively
humid
and
dinner
was
nearly
lost
through
it
the
cook
a
fair
and
plump
dutchman
broke
down
in
the
midst
of
his
pans
and
was
carried
out
to
find
his
breath
again
this
poor
chef
is
up
at
four
o
clock
every
morning
coffee
making
is
working
in
the
galley
which
is
badly
ventilated
all
day
getting
two
hours
rest
in
the
early
afternoon
then
he
goes
on
till
the
saloon
tea
is
over
when
he
begins
to
bake
bread
he
fills
in
his
leisure
in
peeling
potatoes
all
round
the
horizon
motionless
and
permanent
storm
clouds
are
banked
their
forms
do
not
alter
but
their
colours
change
with
the
hours
they
seem
to
encompass
us
in
a
circular
lake
a
range
of
precipitous
and
intricately
piled
alps
high
and
massive
cleaving
those
steeps
of
calamitous
so
they
looked
and
not
in
the
least
like
chasms
full
of
night
and
the
upper
slopes
and
summits
are
lucent
in
amber
and
pearl
in
the
south
and
east
the
ranges
are
indigo
dark
and
threatening
and
the
water
between
us
and
that
closed
country
is
opaque
and
heavy
as
molten
lead
across
the
peaks
of
the
mountains
rest
horizontal
strata
of
mist
some
petrels
were
about
the
evening
is
cool
with
a
slight
head
after
weeks
at
sea
imprisoned
within
the
walls
of
the
sky
walls
which
have
not
opened
once
to
admit
another
vessel
to
give
the
assurance
of
communion
you
begin
to
doubt
your
direction
and
destination
and
the
possibility
of
change
only
the
clouds
change
the
ship
is
no
nearer
breaking
that
rigid
circle
she
can
not
escape
from
her
place
under
the
centre
of
the
dome
the
most
cheering
assurance
i
had
was
the
pulse
of
the
steamer
felt
whenever
i
rested
against
her
warm
body
purposeful
life
was
there
at
least
though
the
day
may
have
been
brazen
and
without
a
hint
of
progress
and
the
sea
the
same
empty
wilderness
yet
when
most
disheartened
in
the
blind
and
melancholy
night
i
felt
under
me
the
beatings
energetic
and
insistent
of
her
lively
heart
some
of
that
vitality
was
communicated
and
i
got
sleep
as
a
child
would
in
the
arms
of
a
strong
and
wakeful
guardian
poised
between
two
nearer
the
clouds
cirrus
and
lofty
though
they
are
than
the
land
straight
beneath
the
with
morning
and
night
the
only
variety
in
the
round
the
days
flicker
by
white
and
black
like
a
magic
lantern
working
without
a
story
tired
of
watching
for
the
fruits
of
our
enterprise
i
went
to
sleep
old
captain
morgan
must
have
lived
a
dull
life
monotonous
with
adventure
what
is
the
use
of
travel
i
asked
myself
the
stars
are
as
near
to
london
as
they
are
to
the
spanish
main
in
their
planetary
journey
through
the
void
the
passengers
at
peckham
see
as
much
as
their
fellows
who
peer
through
the
windows
in
macassar
the
sun
rises
in
the
east
and
the
moon
is
horned
but
some
of
the
passengers
on
the
mudball
strangely
enough
take
their
tea
without
milk
yet
what
of
that
in
the
chart
room
some
days
ago
i
learned
we
had
fathoms
under
us
well
these
waves
of
the
tropics
curling
over
such
abysmal
deeps
look
much
the
same
as
the
waves
off
land
s
end
i
began
to
see
what
i
had
done
i
had
changed
the
murk
of
winter
in
london
for
the
discomforts
of
the
dog
days
i
had
come
thousands
of
miles
to
see
the
thermometer
rise
where
are
the
spanish
main
the
guianas
and
the
brazils
at
last
i
had
discovered
them
i
found
their
true
bearings
they
are
in
raleigh
s
golden
city
of
manoa
in
burney
s
buccaneers
of
america
with
drake
humboldt
bates
and
wallace
and
i
had
left
them
all
at
home
we
borrow
the
light
of
an
observant
and
imaginative
traveller
and
see
the
foreign
land
bright
with
his
aura
and
we
think
it
is
the
country
which
shines
at
eight
this
morning
we
crossed
the
equator
i
paid
my
footing
in
whisky
and
forgot
all
about
the
equator
soon
after
that
idling
under
the
poop
awning
i
picked
up
the
doctor
s
book
from
his
vacant
chair
i
took
the
essays
of
emerson
carelessly
and
read
at
sage
plainly
had
laid
a
trap
for
why
covet
a
knowledge
of
new
facts
day
and
night
a
house
and
garden
a
few
books
a
few
actions
serve
as
well
as
all
trades
and
at
this
moment
the
first
mate
crossed
my
light
and
presently
i
heard
the
sounding
machine
whirring
and
then
stop
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
mate
s
unimportant
voice
fathoms
sir
grey
sand
emerson
went
sprawling
i
stood
up
fathoms
then
that
grey
sand
stuck
to
the
tallow
of
the
weight
was
the
first
of
the
brazils
the
circle
of
waters
was
still
complete
about
us
but
over
the
bows
at
a
great
distance
were
thunder
clouds
and
wild
lights
the
oceanic
swell
had
decreased
to
a
languid
and
glassy
beat
and
the
water
had
become
jade
green
in
colour
shot
with
turquoise
gleams
the
skipper
himself
interested
and
almost
jolly
announced
a
pound
of
tobacco
to
the
first
man
who
spied
the
coast
we
were
nearing
it
at
last
those
far
clouds
canopied
the
forests
of
the
amazon
we
stood
in
at
slow
speed
i
know
those
forests
i
mean
i
have
often
navigated
their
obscure
waterways
rafting
through
the
wilds
on
a
map
in
my
slippers
at
night
now
those
forests
soon
were
to
loom
on
a
veritable
skyline
i
should
see
them
where
they
stood
their
roots
in
the
unfrequented
floods
i
should
see
santa
maria
de
belem
its
aerial
foliage
over
its
shipping
and
squalor
it
was
quite
near
now
i
should
see
santarem
and
obydos
and
itacoatiara
and
then
turning
from
the
king
of
rivers
to
his
tributary
the
madeira
follow
the
madeira
to
the
san
antonio
falls
in
the
heart
of
the
south
american
continent
we
drew
over
feet
with
this
we
were
going
to
try
what
had
never
been
attempted
before
by
an
ocean
steamer
this
too
was
pioneering
i
also
was
on
an
adventure
going
two
thousand
miles
under
those
clouds
of
the
equatorial
rains
to
live
for
a
while
in
the
forests
of
the
orellana
and
our
vessel
s
rigging
so
they
tell
me
sometimes
shall
drag
the
foliage
in
showers
on
our
decks
and
where
we
anchor
at
night
the
creatures
of
the
jungle
will
call
our
nearness
to
land
stirs
up
some
old
dreads
in
our
minds
also
we
discuss
those
dreads
again
though
with
more
concern
than
we
did
at
swansea
over
the
bows
is
now
the
prelude
we
have
heard
many
unsettling
legends
of
yellow
fever
malaria
blackwater
fever
dysentery
and
the
mates
looking
for
land
swear
they
were
fools
to
come
a
voyage
like
this
they
ought
to
have
known
better
the
doctor
who
does
not
always
smile
when
he
is
amused
advises
us
not
to
buy
a
white
sun
umbrella
at
para
but
a
black
one
then
it
will
do
for
the
funerals
land
o
that
was
the
skipper
s
own
perfunctory
cry
he
had
saved
his
pound
of
tobacco
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
there
was
america
i
rediscovered
it
with
some
difficulty
all
i
could
see
was
a
mere
local
thickening
of
the
horizon
as
though
the
pen
which
drew
the
faint
line
dividing
the
world
ahead
into
an
upper
and
a
nether
opalescence
had
run
a
little
freely
at
one
point
that
thickening
of
the
horizon
was
the
island
of
monjui
soon
though
there
was
a
palpable
something
athwart
our
course
the
skyline
heightened
into
a
bluish
barrier
which
as
we
approached
still
nearer
broke
into
sections
the
chart
showed
that
a
series
of
low
wooded
islands
skirted
the
mainland
yet
it
was
hard
to
believe
we
were
approaching
land
again
what
showed
as
land
was
of
too
unsubstantial
a
quality
too
thin
and
broken
a
rind
on
that
vast
area
of
water
to
be
of
any
use
as
a
foothold
where
luminous
sky
was
behind
an
island
groups
of
diminutive
palms
showed
as
tiny
and
distinct
as
the
forms
of
mildew
under
a
magnifying
glass
delicate
black
pencillings
along
the
foot
of
the
often
that
hairlike
tracery
seemed
to
rest
upon
the
sea
the
capella
continued
to
stand
in
till
america
was
more
than
a
frail
and
tinted
illusion
which
sometimes
faded
the
more
the
eye
sought
it
presently
it
cast
reflections
the
islands
grew
into
cobalt
layers
with
vistas
of
silver
water
between
them
giving
them
body
the
course
was
changed
to
west
and
we
cruised
along
for
atalaia
point
towards
the
pilot
station
over
the
thin
and
futile
rind
of
land
which
topped
the
might
have
undulated
on
the
low
thunder
clouds
towered
continents
of
night
in
the
sky
with
translucent
areas
dividing
them
which
were
strangely
illuminated
from
the
hither
side
curtains
as
black
as
bitumen
draped
to
the
waters
from
great
heights
two
of
these
appalling
curtains
trailing
over
america
were
a
little
withdrawn
we
could
look
beyond
them
to
a
diminishing
array
of
glowing
cloud
summits
as
if
we
saw
there
an
accidental
revelation
of
a
secret
and
wonderful
region
with
a
sun
of
its
own
and
all
gigantic
clouds
the
sea
the
far
and
frail
coast
were
serene
and
still
the
air
had
ceased
to
breathe
i
thought
this
new
lucent
world
we
had
found
might
prove
but
a
lucky
dream
after
all
to
be
seen
but
not
to
be
entered
and
that
some
noise
would
presently
shatter
it
and
wake
me
but
we
came
alongside
the
white
pilot
schooner
and
the
pilot
put
off
in
a
boat
manned
by
such
a
crowd
of
grinning
ragged
and
cinnamon
skinned
pirates
as
would
have
broken
the
fragile
wonder
of
any
spell
ours
though
did
not
break
and
i
was
able
to
believe
we
had
arrived
at
sunset
the
great
clouds
were
full
of
explosions
of
electric
fire
and
there
were
momentary
revelations
above
us
of
huge
impending
shapes
we
went
slowly
over
a
lower
world
obscurely
lighted
by
phosphorescent
waves
it
was
not
easy
to
make
out
before
sunrise
what
it
was
we
had
come
to
i
saw
a
phantom
and
indeterminate
country
but
as
though
we
guessed
it
was
suspicious
and
observant
and
its
stillness
a
device
we
moved
forward
slowly
and
noiselessly
as
a
thief
at
an
entrance
low
level
cliffs
were
near
to
either
beam
the
cliffs
might
have
been
the
dense
residuum
of
the
night
the
night
had
been
precipitated
from
the
sky
which
was
clearing
and
brightening
our
steamer
was
between
banks
of
these
iron
shades
suddenly
the
sunrise
ran
a
long
band
of
glowing
saffron
over
the
shadow
to
port
and
the
vague
summit
became
remarkable
with
a
parapet
of
black
filigree
crowns
and
fronds
of
palms
and
strange
trees
showing
in
rigid
patterns
of
ebony
a
faint
air
then
moved
from
off
shore
as
though
under
the
impulse
of
the
pouring
light
it
was
heated
and
humid
and
bore
a
curious
odour
at
once
foreign
and
familiar
the
smell
of
damp
earth
but
not
of
the
earth
i
knew
and
of
vegetation
but
of
vegetation
exotic
and
wild
for
a
time
it
puzzled
me
that
i
knew
the
smell
and
then
i
remembered
where
we
had
met
before
it
was
in
the
palm
house
at
kew
gardens
at
kew
that
odour
once
made
a
deeper
impression
on
me
than
the
extraordinary
vegetation
itself
for
as
a
boy
i
thought
that
i
inhaled
the
very
spirit
of
the
tropics
of
which
it
was
born
after
the
first
minute
on
the
para
river
that
smell
went
and
i
never
noticed
it
again
full
day
came
quickly
to
show
me
the
reality
of
one
of
my
early
visions
and
i
suppose
i
may
not
expect
many
more
such
minutes
as
i
spent
when
watching
from
the
capella
s
bridge
the
forest
of
the
amazon
take
shape
it
was
soon
over
the
morning
light
brimmed
at
the
forest
top
and
spilled
into
the
river
the
channel
filled
with
sunshine
there
it
was
then
in
the
northern
cliff
i
could
see
even
the
boughs
and
trunks
they
were
veins
of
silver
in
a
mass
of
solid
chrysolite
this
forest
had
not
the
rounded
and
dull
verdure
of
our
own
woods
in
midsummer
with
deep
bays
of
shadow
it
was
a
sheer
front
uniform
shadowless
and
astonishingly
vivid
i
thought
then
the
appearance
of
the
forest
was
but
a
local
feature
and
so
gazed
at
it
for
what
it
would
show
me
next
it
had
nothing
else
to
show
me
clumps
of
palms
threw
their
fronds
above
the
forest
roof
in
some
places
or
a
giant
exogen
raised
a
dome
but
that
was
all
those
strong
characters
in
the
growth
were
seen
only
in
passing
they
did
not
change
the
outlook
ahead
of
converging
lines
of
level
green
heights
rising
directly
from
a
brownish
flood
occasionally
the
river
narrowed
or
we
passed
close
to
one
wall
and
then
we
could
see
the
texture
of
the
forest
surface
the
microstructure
of
the
cliff
though
we
could
never
look
into
it
for
more
than
a
few
yards
except
where
in
some
places
habitations
were
thrust
into
the
base
of
the
woods
as
in
lower
caverns
an
exuberant
wealth
of
forms
built
up
that
forest
which
was
so
featureless
from
a
little
distance
the
numerous
palms
gave
grace
and
life
to
the
façade
for
their
plumes
flung
in
noble
arcs
from
tall
and
slender
columns
or
sprayed
directly
from
the
ground
in
emerald
fountains
the
rest
was
inextricable
confusion
vines
looped
across
the
front
of
green
binding
the
forest
with
cordage
and
the
roots
of
epiphytes
dropped
from
upper
boughs
like
hanks
of
twine
in
some
places
the
river
widened
into
lagoons
and
we
seemed
to
be
in
a
maze
of
islands
canoes
shot
across
the
waterways
and
river
schooners
shaped
very
like
junks
with
high
poops
and
blue
and
red
sails
were
diminished
beneath
the
verdure
betraying
the
great
height
of
the
woods
because
of
its
longitudinal
extension
fining
down
to
a
point
in
the
distance
the
elevation
of
the
forest
when
uncontrasted
looked
much
less
than
it
really
was
the
scene
was
so
luminous
still
and
voiceless
it
was
so
like
a
radiant
mirage
or
a
vivid
remembrance
of
an
emotional
dream
got
from
books
read
and
read
again
that
only
the
unquestionable
verity
of
our
iron
steamer
present
with
her
smoke
and
prosaic
gear
convinced
me
that
what
was
outside
us
was
there
across
a
hatch
a
large
butterfly
hovered
and
flickered
like
a
flame
dragon
flies
were
suspended
invisibly
over
our
awning
jewels
in
shimmering
enamels
we
anchored
just
before
breakfast
and
a
small
launch
flying
a
large
brazilian
flag
was
soon
fussing
at
our
gangway
the
brazilian
customs
men
boarded
us
and
the
official
who
was
left
in
charge
to
overlook
the
capella
while
we
remained
was
a
tall
and
majestic
latin
with
dark
eyes
of
such
nobility
and
brooding
melancholy
that
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
our
doctor
who
has
travelled
much
was
other
than
a
fellow
with
a
dull
mind
when
he
removed
some
loose
property
to
his
cabin
and
locked
his
door
before
he
went
ashore
so
i
left
my
field
glasses
on
the
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
them
yet
that
fellow
had
such
lovely
hair
as
the
ladies
would
say
and
his
smile
and
his
courtesy
were
fit
for
kings
he
carried
a
scented
pink
handkerchief
and
wore
patent
leather
boots
our
surgeon
had
but
a
faint
laugh
when
these
explanations
were
made
to
him
taking
my
hand
fondly
and
saying
he
loved
little
children
para
a
flat
congestion
of
white
buildings
and
red
roofs
in
the
sun
was
about
a
mile
beyond
our
anchorage
over
the
port
bow
and
as
its
name
has
been
to
me
one
that
had
the
appeal
of
the
world
not
ours
like
tripoli
of
barbary
macassar
the
marquesas
and
the
rio
madre
de
dios
the
agent
s
launch
as
it
took
us
towards
the
small
craft
lying
immediately
before
the
front
of
that
spread
of
houses
between
the
river
and
the
forest
was
so
momentous
an
occasion
that
the
small
talk
of
the
dainty
englishmen
in
linen
suits
a
gossiping
group
around
the
agent
and
the
skipper
hardly
came
into
the
picture
to
my
mind
the
launch
rudely
hustled
through
a
cluster
of
gaily
painted
native
boats
the
dingiest
of
them
bearing
some
sonorous
name
and
i
landed
in
brazil
there
was
an
esplanade
shadowed
by
an
avenue
of
mangoes
we
crossed
that
and
went
along
hot
narrow
streets
by
blotched
and
shabby
walls
to
the
office
to
which
our
ship
was
consigned
we
met
a
fisherman
carrying
a
large
turtle
by
a
flipper
we
came
to
a
dim
cool
warehouse
there
some
negroes
and
were
lazily
hauling
packages
in
the
shadows
it
had
an
office
railed
off
where
a
few
english
clerks
in
immaculate
white
overlooked
a
staff
of
natives
the
warehouse
had
a
strange
and
memorable
odour
evasive
sweet
and
pungent
as
barbaric
a
note
as
i
found
in
para
and
i
understood
at
once
i
had
come
to
a
place
where
there
were
things
i
did
not
know
i
felt
almost
timorous
and
yet
compelled
when
i
sniffed
at
those
shadows
though
what
the
eye
saw
in
the
squalid
streets
of
the
riverside
where
brown
folk
stood
regarding
us
carelessly
from
openings
in
the
walls
i
had
thought
no
more
than
a
little
interesting
what
length
of
time
we
should
have
in
belem
was
uncertain
but
presently
the
skipper
looking
most
morose
came
away
from
his
discussion
with
the
agent
and
told
us
at
some
length
what
he
thought
of
people
who
kept
a
ship
waiting
because
of
a
few
unimportant
papers
then
he
mumbled
very
reluctantly
that
we
had
plenty
of
time
to
see
all
para
the
doctor
and
i
were
out
of
that
office
before
the
skipper
had
time
to
change
his
mind
our
captain
is
a
very
excellent
master
mariner
but
occasionally
he
likes
to
test
the
security
of
his
absolute
autocracy
to
see
if
it
is
still
sound
i
never
knew
it
when
it
was
not
but
yet
he
must
to
assure
himself
of
a
certainty
or
to
exercise
some
devilish
choler
in
his
nature
sometimes
beat
our
poor
weak
bodies
against
the
adamant
thing
to
see
which
first
will
break
i
will
say
for
him
that
he
is
always
polite
when
handing
back
to
us
our
bruised
fragments
here
he
was
giving
us
a
day
s
freedom
and
one
s
first
city
of
the
tropics
in
which
to
spend
it
and
we
agreed
with
him
that
such
a
waste
of
time
was
almost
unbearable
and
left
hurriedly
outside
the
office
was
a
small
public
square
where
grew
palms
which
ran
flexible
boles
swaying
with
the
weight
of
their
crowns
clear
above
the
surrounding
buildings
shadowing
them
except
in
one
place
where
the
front
of
a
ruinous
church
showed
topped
by
a
crucifix
the
church
a
white
and
dilapidated
structure
was
hoary
with
ficus
and
other
plants
which
grew
from
ledges
and
crevices
through
the
crowns
of
the
palms
the
sunlight
fell
in
dazzling
lathes
and
partitions
chequering
the
stones
an
stood
beneath
the
paraenses
passing
by
at
a
lazy
i
was
soon
compelled
to
the
heat
were
puzzling
folk
to
one
used
to
the
features
of
a
race
of
pure
blood
like
ourselves
portuguese
negro
and
indian
were
there
but
rarely
a
true
type
of
one
except
where
the
black
was
the
predominant
factor
the
men
were
impoverished
bodies
sallow
meagre
and
listless
though
there
were
some
brown
and
brawny
ruffians
by
the
foreshore
but
the
women
often
were
very
showy
creatures
certainly
indolent
in
movement
but
not
listless
and
built
in
notable
curves
they
were
usually
of
a
richer
colour
than
their
mates
and
moved
as
though
their
blood
were
of
a
quicker
temper
they
had
slow
and
insolent
eyes
the
indian
has
given
them
the
black
hair
and
brown
skin
the
negro
the
figure
and
portugal
their
features
and
eyes
of
course
the
ladies
of
para
society
boasting
their
straight
portuguese
descent
are
not
included
in
this
insulting
description
and
i
do
not
think
i
saw
them
unless
indeed
they
were
the
ladies
who
boldly
eyed
us
in
the
fashionable
para
hotel
where
we
lunched
at
a
great
price
off
imported
potatoes
tinned
peas
and
beef
which
in
england
would
be
sold
to
a
glue
factory
i
mean
the
women
in
those
parisian
costumes
erring
something
on
the
sides
of
emphasis
and
whose
remarkable
pallor
was
even
a
little
greenish
in
the
throat
shadows
after
lunch
some
disappointment
and
irresolution
crept
into
our
holiday
had
been
a
that
was
when
para
was
only
in
a
book
that
was
when
its
mere
printed
name
was
to
me
a
token
of
the
tropics
you
know
the
place
i
mean
you
can
picture
it
paths
that
go
at
noon
but
a
little
way
into
the
jungle
which
overshadows
an
isolated
community
of
strange
but
kindly
folk
paths
that
end
in
a
twilight
stillness
ardent
hues
flowers
of
vanilla
warm
rain
a
luscious
and
generative
earth
fireflies
in
the
scented
dusk
of
gardens
and
outlook
disappearing
in
the
dark
of
the
unknown
well
here
i
was
placed
by
the
ordinary
moves
of
circumstance
in
the
very
place
the
name
of
which
once
had
been
to
me
like
a
chord
of
that
music
none
hears
but
oneself
i
stood
in
para
outside
a
picture
postcard
shop
electric
cars
were
bumping
down
a
narrow
street
the
glitter
of
a
cheap
jeweller
s
was
next
to
the
stationer
s
and
on
the
other
side
was
a
vendor
of
american
and
parisian
boots
there
have
been
changes
in
para
since
bates
wrote
his
idylls
of
the
forest
we
two
travellers
after
ordering
some
red
earthenware
chatties
went
to
find
bates
village
of
nazareth
in
it
was
a
mile
from
the
town
it
is
part
of
the
town
now
and
an
electric
tram
took
us
there
a
tram
which
drove
vultures
off
the
line
as
it
bumped
along
the
heat
was
a
serious
burden
the
many
dogs
which
found
energy
enough
to
limp
out
of
the
way
of
the
car
only
when
at
the
point
of
death
were
thin
and
diseased
and
most
unfortunate
to
our
nice
eyes
the
brazilian
men
of
better
quality
we
passed
were
dressed
in
black
cloth
suits
and
one
mocked
the
equator
with
a
silk
hat
and
yellow
boots
i
set
down
these
things
as
the
tram
showed
them
the
evident
pride
and
hauteur
too
of
these
latins
was
a
surprise
to
one
of
a
stronger
race
we
stopped
at
a
street
corner
and
this
was
nazareth
bates
pleasant
hamlet
is
now
the
place
of
para
s
fashionable
still
though
the
overhead
tram
cables
and
the
electric
light
standards
which
interrupt
the
avenues
of
trees
place
you
there
now
your
own
turn
comes
to
look
for
the
romance
of
the
tropics
in
another
century
but
the
villas
are
in
heliotrope
primrose
azure
and
rose
bowered
in
extravagant
arbours
of
papaws
mangoes
bananas
and
palms
with
shrubberies
beneath
of
feathery
mimosas
and
cassias
with
orange
and
crimson
blooms
and
my
last
walk
ashore
was
in
swansea
high
street
in
the
winter
rain
from
nazareth
s
main
street
the
side
turnings
go
down
to
the
forest
for
in
spite
of
its
quays
its
steamers
and
its
electric
trams
para
is
but
built
in
a
larger
clearing
of
the
wilderness
the
jungle
stood
at
the
bottom
of
all
suburban
streets
a
definite
city
wall
the
spontaneity
and
savage
freedom
of
the
plant
life
in
this
land
of
alternate
hot
sun
and
warm
showers
at
last
blurred
and
made
insignificant
to
me
the
men
who
braved
it
in
silk
hats
and
broadcloth
there
and
the
trams
and
the
jewellers
shops
for
my
experience
of
vegetation
was
got
on
my
knees
in
a
london
suburb
praying
things
to
come
out
of
the
cold
mud
here
i
began
to
suspect
they
besieged
us
quick
and
turbulent
an
exhaustible
army
ready
to
reconquer
the
foothold
man
had
hardly
won
and
to
obliterate
his
works
we
passed
through
where
naked
brown
babies
played
before
the
doors
we
happened
upon
the
cathedral
and
went
on
to
the
little
dock
where
native
vessels
rested
on
garbage
the
tide
being
out
vultures
pulled
at
stuff
beneath
the
bilges
the
crews
more
indian
than
anything
and
men
of
better
body
than
the
sallow
fellows
in
the
town
sprawled
on
the
hot
stones
of
the
quays
and
about
the
decks
there
was
a
huge
negress
arms
akimbo
a
shapeless
monument
in
black
indiarubber
draped
in
cotton
print
who
talked
loudly
with
a
red
boneless
mouth
to
two
disregarding
indians
sitting
with
their
backs
to
a
wall
she
had
a
rabbit
s
foot
mounted
in
silver
hanging
between
her
dugs
the
schooners
ranged
in
an
arcade
were
rigged
for
lateen
sails
very
like
mediterranean
craft
the
forest
was
a
narrow
neutral
tinted
ribbon
far
beyond
the
sky
was
blue
the
texture
of
porcelain
the
river
was
yellow
and
i
was
grievously
disappointed
yet
if
you
put
it
to
me
i
can
not
say
why
there
was
something
missing
and
i
don
t
know
what
there
was
something
i
could
not
find
but
as
it
is
too
intangible
a
matter
for
me
to
describe
even
now
you
may
say
if
you
like
that
the
fault
was
with
me
and
not
with
para
we
stood
in
a
shady
place
and
the
doctor
looking
down
at
his
hand
suddenly
struck
it
let
us
go
he
said
he
showed
me
the
corpse
of
a
mosquito
have
you
ever
seen
the
yellow
fever
chap
the
doctor
asked
that
is
we
left
near
the
agent
s
office
we
met
an
english
shipping
clerk
and
he
took
us
into
a
drink
shop
and
sat
us
at
a
table
having
gilded
iron
legs
and
called
for
gin
tonics
we
began
to
tell
him
what
we
thought
of
para
it
did
not
seem
much
of
a
place
it
was
neither
here
nor
there
he
was
a
pallid
fellow
with
a
contemplative
smile
and
with
weary
eyes
and
tired
movements
i
know
all
that
he
said
it
s
a
bit
of
a
hole
d
be
surprised
there
s
a
lot
here
you
don
t
see
at
first
it
s
big
all
out
waved
his
arm
west
s
a
world
with
no
light
yet
you
get
lost
in
it
but
you
re
going
up
you
ll
see
the
other
end
of
the
forest
is
as
far
from
the
people
in
the
streets
here
as
london
s
they
know
no
more
about
it
i
was
like
you
when
i
first
came
i
gave
the
place
a
week
and
then
reckoned
i
knew
it
near
enough
now
i
i
m
half
afraid
of
it
not
afraid
of
anything
i
can
see
i
don
t
know
there
s
something
dam
strange
about
it
something
you
never
can
find
out
it
s
something
that
s
been
here
since
the
beginning
and
it
s
too
big
and
strong
for
us
it
waits
its
time
i
can
feel
it
now
look
at
those
palm
trees
outside
don
t
they
look
as
if
they
re
waiting
what
are
they
waiting
for
you
get
that
feeling
here
in
the
afternoon
when
you
can
t
get
air
and
the
rain
clouds
are
banking
up
round
the
woods
and
nothing
moves
lord
said
a
fellow
to
me
when
i
first
came
tell
us
about
peckham
but
for
the
spicy
talk
about
yellow
fever
i
d
think
i
was
dead
and
waiting
wide
awake
for
the
judgment
that
s
just
the
feeling
as
if
something
dark
was
coming
and
you
couldn
t
move
there
the
forest
is
all
round
us
nobody
knows
what
s
at
the
back
of
it
men
leave
para
going
up
river
we
have
a
drink
in
here
and
they
go
up
river
and
don
t
come
back
down
by
the
square
one
day
i
saw
an
old
boy
in
white
ducks
and
a
sun
helmet
having
a
shindy
with
the
sentry
at
the
barracks
the
old
fellow
was
kicking
up
a
dust
he
was
english
and
i
suppose
he
thought
the
sentry
would
understand
him
if
he
shouted
english
and
americans
do
you
have
to
get
into
the
road
here
when
you
approach
the
barracks
it
s
the
custom
the
sentry
always
sends
you
off
the
pavement
the
old
chap
was
quite
red
in
the
face
about
it
and
the
things
he
was
saying
lucky
for
him
the
soldier
didn
t
know
what
he
meant
so
i
went
over
as
he
was
an
englishman
and
told
him
what
the
sentry
wanted
what
said
the
man
walk
in
the
road
not
me
i
d
sooner
go
go
back
he
did
too
i
walked
with
him
and
we
got
rather
pally
we
came
in
here
we
sat
at
that
table
in
the
corner
he
said
he
was
captain
davis
of
barry
ever
heard
of
him
he
said
he
had
brought
out
a
river
boat
and
he
was
taking
her
up
the
rio
japura
the
way
he
talked
do
you
know
the
japura
well
it
s
a
deuce
of
a
way
from
here
but
that
old
captain
talked
like
a
child
he
was
so
obstinate
about
it
he
was
going
to
take
that
boat
up
the
japura
and
you
d
have
thought
it
was
above
boulter
s
lock
then
he
began
to
swear
about
the
dagoes
the
old
chap
got
quite
wild
again
when
he
thought
of
that
soldier
he
was
a
little
man
nothing
of
him
and
his
face
was
screwed
up
as
if
he
was
always
annoyed
about
something
you
have
to
take
things
as
they
come
here
and
let
it
go
but
this
davis
man
was
an
irritable
old
boy
and
most
of
his
talk
was
about
money
he
said
he
was
through
with
the
boat
running
jobs
no
more
of
em
it
was
as
bare
as
boards
nothing
to
be
made
at
the
game
he
said
over
his
left
eye
he
had
a
funny
hairy
wart
a
sort
of
knob
and
whenever
he
got
excited
it
turned
red
i
may
say
he
let
me
pay
for
all
the
drinks
i
reckon
he
was
pretty
close
with
his
money
he
told
me
he
knew
a
man
in
barry
who
d
got
a
fine
little
he
said
there
was
a
stuffed
bear
at
the
pub
and
it
brought
lots
of
customers
seemed
to
think
i
must
know
the
place
he
said
he
was
going
to
try
to
get
an
alligator
for
the
chap
who
kept
the
pub
the
alligator
could
stand
on
its
hind
legs
at
the
other
side
of
the
door
with
an
electric
bulb
in
its
mouth
like
a
lemon
that
was
his
fine
idea
he
reckoned
that
would
bring
customers
then
old
davis
started
to
fidget
about
i
began
to
think
he
wanted
to
tell
me
something
and
i
wondered
what
the
deuce
it
was
i
thought
it
was
money
it
generally
is
at
last
he
told
me
he
wanted
one
of
those
dried
indian
heads
for
that
pub
you
know
what
i
mean
he
said
the
indians
kill
somebody
and
make
his
head
smaller
than
a
baby
s
and
the
hair
hangs
down
all
have
you
ever
seen
one
of
those
heads
the
indians
bone
em
and
stuff
em
with
spice
and
gums
and
let
em
dry
in
the
sun
they
don
t
look
nice
i
ve
seen
one
or
two
but
i
tried
to
persuade
him
to
let
the
head
go
the
government
has
stopped
that
business
you
know
got
a
bit
too
thick
if
you
ordered
a
head
the
johnnies
would
just
go
out
and
have
somebody
s
napper
i
missed
old
davis
after
that
i
was
transferred
to
manaos
up
river
i
don
t
know
what
became
of
him
it
was
nearly
a
year
when
i
came
back
to
para
our
people
had
had
the
clearing
of
that
boat
old
davis
brought
out
and
i
found
some
of
his
papers
still
unsettled
i
asked
about
him
in
a
general
way
and
found
he
hadn
t
arrived
his
tug
had
been
back
twice
when
it
was
here
last
it
seemed
the
native
skipper
explained
davis
went
ashore
when
returning
at
a
place
where
they
touched
for
rubber
he
went
into
the
village
and
didn
t
come
back
well
it
seems
the
skipper
waited
no
davis
so
he
tootled
his
whistle
and
went
on
up
stream
because
the
river
was
falling
and
he
had
some
more
stations
to
do
in
the
season
he
was
at
the
village
again
in
a
few
days
though
and
davis
wasn
t
there
then
the
tug
captain
said
the
village
was
deserted
and
he
supposed
the
old
chap
had
gone
down
river
in
another
boat
but
he
s
not
back
yet
the
boss
said
the
fever
had
got
him
somewhere
that
s
the
way
things
go
here
a
month
ago
an
american
civil
engineer
touched
here
and
had
to
wait
for
a
boat
for
new
york
he
d
been
right
up
country
surveying
for
some
job
or
another
peru
way
i
went
up
to
his
hotel
with
the
fellows
to
see
him
one
evening
he
was
on
his
knees
packing
his
trunks
say
boys
he
said
sitting
on
the
floor
i
brought
a
whole
lot
of
truck
from
way
up
and
now
it
hasn
t
got
a
smile
for
he
offered
me
his
collection
of
butterflies
then
the
yankee
picked
up
a
ball
of
newspaper
off
the
floor
and
began
to
peel
it
this
goes
home
he
said
have
you
seen
anything
like
that
i
bet
you
haven
he
held
out
the
opened
packet
in
his
hand
and
there
was
a
brown
core
to
it
i
reckon
that
is
thousands
of
years
old
said
the
american
it
was
a
little
dried
head
no
bigger
than
a
cricket
ball
and
about
the
same
colour
very
like
an
indian
s
too
the
features
were
quite
plain
and
there
was
a
tiny
wart
over
the
left
eyebrow
i
bet
you
that
s
thousands
of
years
old
said
the
american
i
bet
you
it
isn
t
two
i
we
returned
to
the
steamer
in
the
late
afternoon
bringing
with
us
two
brazilian
pilots
who
were
to
take
us
as
far
as
itacoatiara
we
sailed
next
morning
for
the
interior
para
like
all
the
towns
on
the
amazon
has
but
one
way
out
of
it
there
is
a
continent
behind
para
but
you
can
not
go
that
way
when
you
leave
the
city
you
must
take
the
river
para
stands
by
the
only
entrance
to
what
is
now
the
greatest
region
of
virgin
tropics
left
in
the
world
always
at
anchor
off
the
city
s
front
are
at
least
a
dozen
european
steamers
most
of
them
flying
the
red
ensign
a
famous
engineering
contractor
also
british
is
busy
constructing
modern
wharves
there
and
thames
tugs
and
mudhoppers
flying
the
brazilian
flag
as
the
law
insists
but
bawling
london
compliments
as
they
pass
your
ship
help
the
native
schooners
with
their
rakish
lateen
sails
blue
and
scarlet
to
make
the
anchorage
brisk
and
lively
looking
out
from
the
capella
s
bridge
she
appeared
to
be
within
a
lagoon
the
lake
was
elliptical
and
so
large
it
was
a
world
for
the
eye
to
range
in
it
was
bound
by
a
low
barrier
of
forest
a
barrier
distant
enough
to
lose
colour
nature
and
significance
para
white
and
red
lay
reflecting
the
sunset
from
many
facets
in
the
with
a
cheerful
array
of
superior
towers
and
spires
from
the
ship
para
looked
big
modern
and
prosperous
and
with
those
vast
rounded
clouds
of
the
rains
assembling
and
mounting
over
the
bright
city
and
brooding
there
impassive
and
dark
but
with
impending
keels
lustrous
with
the
burnish
of
copper
and
steel
and
seeing
a
rainbow
curving
down
from
one
cloud
over
the
city
s
white
front
i
being
a
and
with
a
pardonable
feeling
of
exhilaration
which
was
of
my
own
in
a
new
and
a
wide
and
radiant
place
thought
of
man
there
as
a
conqueror
who
had
overcome
the
wilderness
builded
him
a
city
bridled
the
exuberance
of
a
savage
land
and
directed
the
sap
and
life
born
in
a
rich
soil
of
ardent
sun
and
rain
into
the
forms
useful
to
him
so
i
entered
the
and
looked
with
a
new
interest
on
the
chart
of
the
place
then
i
felt
less
certain
of
the
conqueror
and
his
taming
bridle
i
saw
that
this
lagoon
in
which
the
capella
showed
large
and
important
was
but
a
point
in
an
immense
area
of
tractless
islands
and
meandering
waterways
a
region
intricate
and
the
chart
confessed
little
known
the
coast
opposite
the
city
which
i
had
taken
for
mainland
was
the
trivial
ihla
des
oncas
the
main
channel
of
the
river
was
beyond
that
island
with
the
coast
of
marajo
for
the
farther
shore
and
marajo
also
was
but
an
island
though
as
large
as
wales
the
north
channel
of
the
amazon
was
beyond
again
with
more
islands
about
which
the
chart
confessed
less
knowledge
one
of
the
pilots
was
with
me
and
when
i
spoke
of
those
points
in
the
ultimate
amazons
the
alluring
names
on
maps
you
read
in
england
here
they
were
at
para
just
what
they
are
at
home
still
vague
and
far
journeys
thither
to
be
reckoned
by
time
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
look
of
amusement
two
months
senhor
or
perhaps
three
or
four
the
idea
came
slowly
but
it
dawned
something
like
the
conception
of
astronomy
s
amplitudes
of
the
remoteness
of
the
beyond
of
amazonas
that
new
world
i
had
just
entered
i
crept
within
the
mosquito
curtain
that
night
and
the
still
heated
dark
lay
on
my
mind
the
pressure
of
an
unknown
full
of
dread
i
thought
of
the
pale
shipping
clerk
and
his
tired
smile
and
of
captain
davis
his
face
no
bigger
than
a
cricket
ball
and
the
same
colour
with
a
wart
over
his
eye
and
recalled
the
anxious
canvass
i
had
heard
made
for
news
of
sickness
a
ship
had
passed
outwards
that
morning
the
consul
told
us
with
twenty
men
on
board
down
with
fever
and
thorwaldsen
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
thorwaldsen
he
was
a
trader
and
last
rainy
season
he
took
his
vessel
up
some
far
backwater
beyond
manaos
with
his
wife
and
his
little
daughter
news
had
just
come
from
nowhere
to
para
that
his
wife
had
died
in
childbirth
in
the
wilds
and
thorwaldsen
had
been
murdered
but
nothing
was
known
of
his
daughter
there
it
was
i
did
not
know
the
thorwaldsens
but
the
trader
s
little
girl
who
might
then
be
alone
in
the
gloom
of
the
jungle
with
savages
helped
to
keep
me
awake
and
the
wife
that
swede
she
was
in
the
alien
wilderness
beyond
all
gentlehood
when
her
time
came
i
could
see
two
mosquitoes
doing
their
best
to
work
backwards
through
the
curtain
mesh
they
were
after
me
the
emissaries
of
the
unknown
and
their
pertinacity
was
astonishing
the
capella
left
para
at
three
o
clock
this
morning
and
continued
up
the
para
river
daylight
found
us
in
a
wide
brownish
stream
with
the
shores
low
and
indistinguishable
on
either
beam
when
the
sun
grew
hot
the
jungle
came
close
in
it
was
often
so
close
that
we
could
see
the
nests
of
wasps
on
the
trees
like
grey
shields
hanging
there
between
the
para
river
and
the
amazon
the
waters
dissipate
into
a
maze
of
serpenting
ditches
in
width
these
channels
usually
are
no
more
than
canals
but
they
were
deep
enough
to
float
our
big
tramp
steamer
they
thread
a
multitude
of
islands
islands
overloaded
with
a
massed
growth
which
topped
our
our
steamer
was
enclosed
within
resonant
chasms
and
the
noise
and
incongruity
of
our
progress
awoke
deep
protests
there
the
dilated
loom
of
the
rains
the
cloud
shapes
so
continental
that
they
occupied
where
they
stood
not
so
far
away
all
the
space
between
the
earth
and
sky
bulged
over
the
forest
at
the
end
of
every
view
the
heat
was
luscious
but
then
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
look
on
from
a
hammock
under
the
awning
the
foliage
which
was
pressed
out
over
the
water
not
many
yards
from
the
hurrying
capella
had
a
closeness
of
texture
astonishing
and
even
awful
to
one
who
knew
only
the
thin
woods
of
the
north
it
ascended
directly
from
the
water
s
edge
sometimes
out
of
the
water
and
we
did
not
often
see
its
foundation
there
were
no
shady
aisles
and
glades
the
sight
was
stopped
on
a
front
of
polished
emerald
a
congestion
of
stiff
leaves
the
air
was
still
individual
sprays
and
fronds
projecting
from
the
mass
in
parabolas
with
flamboyant
abandon
and
poise
were
as
rigid
as
metallic
and
enamelled
shapes
the
diversity
of
forms
and
especially
the
number
and
variety
of
the
palms
so
overloaded
an
unseen
standing
that
the
parapets
of
the
woods
occasionally
leaned
outwards
to
form
an
arcade
above
our
masts
one
should
not
call
this
the
jungle
it
was
even
a
soft
and
benignant
eden
this
was
the
forest
i
really
wished
to
find
often
the
heavy
parapets
of
the
woods
were
upheld
on
long
colonnades
of
grey
palm
boles
or
the
whole
upper
structure
appeared
based
on
low
green
arches
the
pennate
fronds
of
smaller
palms
flung
direct
from
the
earth
there
was
not
a
sound
but
the
noise
of
our
intruding
steamer
occasionally
we
brushed
a
projecting
spray
or
a
vine
pendent
from
a
cornice
we
proved
the
forest
then
in
some
shallow
places
were
regiments
of
aquatic
grasses
bearing
long
plumes
there
were
trees
which
stood
in
the
water
on
a
tangle
of
straight
pallid
roots
as
though
on
stilts
this
of
intense
life
so
seldom
showed
the
land
to
which
it
was
fast
and
the
side
rivers
and
paranas
were
so
many
that
i
could
believe
the
forest
afloat
an
archipelago
of
opaque
green
vapours
our
heavy
wash
swayed
and
undulated
the
aquatic
plants
and
grasses
as
though
disturbing
the
fringe
of
those
green
clouds
which
clung
to
the
water
because
of
their
weight
in
a
still
air
there
was
seldom
a
sign
of
life
but
the
infrequent
snowy
herons
and
those
curious
brown
fowl
the
ciganas
the
sun
was
flaming
on
the
majestic
assembly
of
the
storm
the
warm
air
broken
by
our
steamer
coiled
over
us
in
a
lazy
flux
i
did
not
hear
the
bell
calling
to
meals
we
all
hung
over
the
capella
s
side
gaping
like
a
lot
of
boys
sometimes
we
passed
single
habitations
on
the
water
side
ephemeral
huts
of
were
forced
down
by
the
forest
which
overhung
them
to
wade
on
frail
stilts
a
canoe
would
be
tied
to
a
toy
jetty
and
on
the
jetty
a
sad
woman
and
several
naked
children
would
stand
with
no
show
of
emotion
to
watch
us
go
by
behind
them
was
the
impenetrable
foliage
i
thought
of
the
precarious
tenure
on
earth
of
these
brown
folk
with
some
sadness
especially
as
the
day
was
going
the
easy
dominance
of
the
wilderness
and
man
s
intelligent
morsel
of
life
resisting
it
was
made
plain
when
we
came
suddenly
upon
one
of
his
little
shacks
secreted
among
the
aqueous
roots
of
a
great
tree
cowering
as
it
were
between
two
of
the
giant
s
toes
those
brown
babies
on
the
jetties
never
cheered
us
they
watched
us
serious
and
forlorn
alongside
their
primitive
hut
were
a
few
rubber
trees
which
we
knew
by
their
scars
late
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
a
large
cavern
in
the
base
of
the
forest
a
shadowy
place
where
at
last
we
did
see
a
gathering
of
the
folk
a
number
of
little
wooden
crosses
peeped
above
the
floor
in
the
hollow
the
sundering
floods
and
the
forest
do
not
always
keep
these
folk
from
congregation
and
the
comfort
of
the
last
communion
there
was
a
question
at
night
as
to
whether
our
pilots
would
anchor
or
not
they
decided
to
go
on
we
did
not
go
the
route
of
bates
breves
but
took
the
parana
de
buyassa
on
our
way
to
the
amazon
it
was
night
when
we
got
to
the
parana
and
but
for
the
trailing
lights
the
fairy
mooring
lines
of
habitations
in
the
woods
and
what
the
silent
explosions
of
lightning
revealed
of
great
heads
of
trees
startlingly
close
and
monstrous
as
though
watching
us
in
silent
and
intent
regard
we
saw
nothing
of
once
i
knew
a
small
boy
and
on
a
summer
day
too
much
in
the
past
now
to
be
recalled
without
some
private
emotion
he
said
to
his
father
on
the
beach
of
a
popular
east
anglian
resort
and
where
is
the
sea
he
stood
then
for
the
first
time
where
the
sea
by
all
the
promises
of
pictures
and
poems
should
have
been
breaking
on
its
cold
grey
crags
the
sea
said
the
father
in
astonishment
why
there
it
is
didn
t
you
know
and
that
father
being
an
exact
man
there
beyond
appeal
the
sea
was
and
what
was
it
a
discoloured
wash
of
mean
limit
which
flopped
wearily
on
some
shabby
sands
littered
with
people
and
luncheon
papers
such
a
flat
stupid
and
leaden
disillusion
surely
never
before
fell
on
the
upturned
bright
and
expectant
soul
of
a
young
human
who
i
can
vouch
began
life
like
most
others
believing
the
noblest
of
everything
it
was
an
ocean
which
was
inferior
even
to
the
and
could
be
seen
but
in
division
when
that
child
walking
along
the
rank
of
those
boxes
on
wheels
peeped
between
them
you
will
have
noticed
with
what
simple
indifference
the
people
who
really
know
what
they
call
the
truth
will
shatter
an
illusion
we
have
long
cherished
though
as
we
alone
see
our
private
dreams
those
honest
folk
can
not
be
blamed
for
poking
their
feet
through
fine
pictures
they
did
not
know
were
there
i
had
a
picture
of
the
amazon
which
i
had
long
cherished
i
was
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
of
the
capella
watching
the
jungle
pass
the
doctor
was
with
me
i
thought
we
were
still
on
the
para
river
and
was
waiting
for
our
vessel
to
emerge
from
that
stream
as
through
a
narrow
gate
dramatically
into
the
broad
sunlight
of
the
greatest
river
in
the
world
the
king
of
rivers
the
amazon
of
my
picture
we
idly
scanned
the
forest
with
binoculars
having
nothing
to
do
and
saw
some
herons
and
the
ciganas
and
once
a
sloth
which
was
hanging
to
a
tree
para
i
felt
was
as
distant
as
london
the
silence
the
immobility
of
it
all
and
the
pour
of
the
tropic
sun
were
just
beginning
to
be
a
little
subduing
we
had
come
already
to
the
wilderness
there
was
i
thought
a
very
great
deal
of
this
forest
and
it
never
varied
we
shall
be
on
the
amazon
soon
i
said
hopefully
to
the
doctor
we
have
been
on
it
for
hours
he
replied
and
that
is
how
i
got
there
but
the
amazon
is
not
seen
any
more
than
is
the
sea
at
the
first
glance
what
the
eye
first
gathers
is
naturally
for
it
is
but
an
eye
nothing
like
commensurate
with
your
own
image
of
the
river
the
mind
by
suggestive
symbols
builds
something
portentous
a
vague
and
tremendous
idea
what
i
saw
was
only
a
very
swift
and
opaque
yellow
flood
not
much
broader
it
seemed
to
me
than
the
thames
at
gravesend
and
the
monotonous
green
of
the
forest
it
was
all
i
saw
for
a
considerable
time
i
see
something
different
now
it
is
not
easily
explained
merely
as
a
yellow
river
with
a
verdant
elevation
on
either
hand
and
over
it
a
blue
sky
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
except
by
luck
a
word
which
would
convey
the
immensity
of
the
land
of
the
amazons
something
of
the
aloofness
and
separation
of
the
points
of
its
extremes
with
months
and
months
of
adventure
between
them
what
a
journey
it
would
be
from
ino
in
bolivia
on
the
rio
madre
de
dios
to
conception
in
colombia
on
the
rio
putumayo
there
is
another
odyssey
in
a
voyage
like
that
and
think
of
the
names
of
those
places
and
rivers
when
i
take
the
map
of
south
america
now
and
hold
it
with
the
estuary
of
the
amazon
as
its
base
my
thoughts
are
like
those
might
be
of
a
lost
ant
crawling
in
and
over
the
furrows
and
ridges
of
an
exposed
root
as
he
regards
all
he
may
of
the
trunk
rising
into
the
whole
upper
cosmos
of
a
spreading
oak
the
amazon
then
looks
to
me
properly
symbolical
as
a
monstrous
tree
and
its
tributaries
paranas
furos
and
igarapes
as
the
great
boughs
little
boughs
and
twigs
of
its
ascending
and
spreading
ramifications
so
minutely
dissecting
the
continent
with
its
numberless
watercourses
that
the
mind
sees
that
dark
region
as
an
impenetrable
density
of
green
and
secret
leaves
which
literally
when
you
go
there
is
what
you
will
find
you
enter
the
leaves
and
vanish
you
creep
about
the
region
of
but
one
of
its
branches
under
a
roof
of
foliage
which
stays
the
midday
shine
and
lets
it
through
to
you
in
the
dusk
of
the
interior
but
as
points
of
distant
starlight
occasionally
as
we
did
upon
a
day
you
see
something
like
santarem
there
is
a
break
and
a
change
in
the
journey
moving
blindly
through
the
maze
of
green
there
hanging
in
the
clear
day
at
the
end
of
a
bough
is
a
golden
fruit
the
torrid
morning
tempered
by
a
cooling
breeze
which
followed
us
up
river
was
soon
overcast
disappointingly
narrow
at
first
the
amazon
broadened
later
but
not
to
one
s
conception
of
its
magnitude
but
the
greatness
of
this
stream
i
have
already
learned
dawns
upon
you
in
time
and
if
you
sufficiently
endure
it
persists
about
you
this
forest
and
this
river
like
the
stark
desolation
of
the
sea
the
real
width
of
the
river
is
not
often
seen
because
of
the
islands
which
fringe
its
banks
many
of
them
of
considerable
size
the
side
channels
or
between
the
islands
and
the
shores
are
used
in
preference
to
the
main
stream
by
the
native
sailing
craft
to
avoid
the
strength
of
the
current
we
had
the
river
to
ourselves
the
capella
was
taken
by
the
pilots
first
over
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
dodging
the
set
of
the
stream
the
forest
has
changed
it
has
now
a
graceless
and
savage
aspect
when
we
are
close
to
it
there
are
not
so
many
palms
at
a
little
distance
the
growth
appears
a
mass
of
spindly
oaks
and
beeches
though
with
a
more
vivid
and
lighter
green
foliage
but
when
near
it
shows
itself
alien
enough
a
front
of
nameless
and
congested
leaves
i
suppose
it
would
be
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
altitude
sometimes
the
forest
stands
in
the
water
at
other
times
a
yellow
bank
shows
a
narrow
strip
under
the
trees
rarely
more
than
four
feet
high
and
strewn
with
the
bleaching
skeletons
of
trees
and
entanglements
of
vine
there
is
rarely
a
sign
of
life
once
this
morning
a
bird
called
in
the
woods
when
we
were
close
butterflies
are
continually
crossing
the
ship
and
dragonflies
and
great
wasps
and
hornets
are
hawking
over
us
the
sight
of
one
swallowtail
butterfly
a
big
black
and
yellow
fellow
sent
the
cook
insane
the
insect
stayed
its
noble
flight
poised
over
our
hatch
and
then
came
down
to
see
what
we
were
it
settled
on
a
coil
of
rope
leisurely
pulsing
its
wings
the
cook
at
the
sight
of
this
bold
and
bright
being
sprang
from
the
galley
and
leaped
down
to
the
deck
with
a
dish
cloth
to
our
surprise
he
caught
the
insect
and
explained
with
eagerness
how
that
the
shattered
pattern
of
colours
which
more
than
covered
his
gross
palm
would
improve
his
firescreen
in
a
rotterdam
parlour
early
in
the
forenoon
sections
of
the
forest
vanished
in
grey
rain
squalls
though
elsewhere
the
sun
was
brilliant
the
plane
of
the
dingy
yellow
flood
was
variegated
with
transient
areas
of
bright
sulphur
and
chocolate
we
were
hugging
the
right
bank
and
so
saw
the
mouth
of
the
xingu
as
we
passed
at
midday
some
hills
ahead
the
serra
de
almerim
gave
us
relief
from
the
dead
level
of
the
wearying
green
walls
the
sight
of
those
blue
heights
with
their
flat
were
perhaps
no
more
than
feet
above
the
stimulated
the
eye
and
lifted
one
s
humour
long
depressed
by
the
everlasting
sameness
of
the
prospect
and
the
heat
later
in
the
day
we
passed
more
of
the
welcome
hills
the
serra
de
maranuaqua
velha
pobre
and
serras
de
tapaiunaquara
and
paranaquara
their
cones
truncated
pyramids
knolls
and
hog
backs
ranging
contrary
to
our
course
bates
says
some
of
them
are
bare
or
covered
only
with
a
short
herbage
but
all
those
i
examined
with
a
good
telescope
had
forest
to
the
summits
though
a
few
of
the
inferior
heights
which
stood
behind
the
island
of
jurupari
the
island
where
dreams
come
at
night
were
grassy
those
cobalt
prominences
rose
like
precipitous
islands
from
a
green
sea
we
were
the
only
spectators
one
high
range
as
we
passed
was
veiled
in
a
glittering
mesh
of
rain
the
river
after
we
left
jurupari
bent
round
and
brought
the
heights
astern
of
us
the
sun
set
the
river
and
the
forest
are
best
at
sundown
the
serene
level
rays
discovered
the
woods
we
saw
trees
then
distinctly
almost
as
a
surprise
till
then
the
forest
had
been
but
a
gloom
by
day
behind
us
was
the
jungle
front
it
changed
from
green
to
gold
a
band
of
light
between
the
river
and
the
darkling
sky
some
greater
trees
emerged
majestically
it
was
the
first
time
that
day
we
had
really
seen
the
features
of
the
jungle
it
was
but
a
momentary
revelation
the
clouds
were
reflectors
throwing
amber
lights
below
in
the
hills
astern
of
us
ravines
hitherto
unsuspected
caught
the
transitory
glory
the
dark
heights
had
many
polished
facets
one
range
and
wooded
i
thought
resembled
the
promontories
about
clovelly
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
amazon
had
the
bright
eyes
of
a
friend
on
a
ridge
of
those
heights
i
could
see
the
sky
through
some
of
its
trees
the
light
quickly
gave
out
and
it
was
night
we
continued
cruising
along
the
south
shore
the
usual
pulsations
of
lightning
made
night
intermittent
the
forest
was
not
more
than
feet
from
our
vessel
and
sitting
under
the
awning
the
trees
kept
jumping
out
of
the
night
startlingly
near
the
night
was
still
and
hot
and
my
cabin
lamp
had
attracted
myriads
of
insects
through
the
door
which
had
been
left
open
for
air
a
heap
of
crawlers
lay
dead
on
the
desk
and
the
bunk
curtain
was
smothered
with
grotesque
winged
shapes
flies
cicadas
mantis
phasmas
moths
beetles
and
next
morning
found
us
running
along
the
north
shore
parrots
were
squawking
in
the
woods
alongside
a
large
alligator
floated
close
by
the
ship
its
jaws
open
in
menace
at
breakfast
time
a
strip
of
white
beach
came
into
view
on
the
opposite
coast
a
place
in
that
world
of
three
colours
on
which
one
s
tired
eyes
could
alight
and
rest
that
was
santarem
sharp
hills
rose
immediately
behind
the
town
the
town
is
in
a
saddle
of
the
hills
slipping
down
to
the
river
in
terraces
of
white
chrome
and
blue
houses
the
rio
tapajos
a
black
water
tributary
and
a
noble
river
enters
the
main
stream
by
santarem
its
dark
flood
sharply
contrasted
with
the
tawny
amazon
but
the
amazon
sweeps
right
across
its
mouth
in
a
masterful
way
there
is
a
definite
line
dividing
black
from
yellow
water
and
then
no
more
tapajos
we
passed
numerous
floating
islands
ilhas
de
caapim
and
trees
adrift
evidence
the
pilots
said
that
the
river
was
rising
these
grass
islands
are
a
feature
of
the
amazon
they
look
like
lush
pastures
adrift
some
of
them
are
so
large
it
is
difficult
to
believe
they
are
really
afloat
till
they
come
alongside
then
if
the
river
is
at
all
broken
by
a
breeze
the
meadow
plainly
undulates
this
floating
cane
and
grass
grows
in
the
sheltered
bays
and
quiet
for
though
the
latter
are
navigable
of
the
river
in
the
rainy
season
in
the
dry
they
are
merely
isolated
swamps
but
when
the
river
is
in
flood
the
earth
is
washed
away
from
the
roots
of
this
marsh
growth
and
it
moves
off
a
flourishing
mobile
field
often
twenty
feet
in
thickness
such
islands
when
large
can
be
dangerous
to
small
craft
small
flowers
blossom
on
these
aquatic
fields
which
shelter
snakes
and
turtles
and
sometimes
the
the
manatee
obydos
was
in
sight
in
the
afternoon
but
presently
we
lost
it
in
a
violent
squall
of
rain
the
squall
came
down
like
a
gun
burst
and
nearly
carried
away
the
awnings
it
was
evening
before
we
were
abreast
of
that
most
picturesque
town
i
saw
on
the
river
obydos
rests
on
one
of
the
rare
amazon
cliffs
of
rufus
clay
and
sandstone
the
forest
mounts
the
hill
above
it
and
the
scattered
red
roofs
of
the
town
show
in
a
surf
of
foliage
the
cliffs
glowed
in
cream
and
cherry
tints
with
a
cascade
of
vines
falling
over
them
though
not
reaching
the
shore
the
dainty
little
houses
sit
high
in
a
loop
of
the
cliffs
we
left
the
city
behind
with
a
huge
cumulus
cloud
resting
over
it
and
the
evening
light
on
all
but
obydos
and
sunsets
and
rain
squalls
and
the
fireflies
which
flit
about
the
dark
ship
at
night
in
myriads
tiny
blue
and
yellow
which
burn
with
puzzling
inconstancy
as
though
being
switched
on
and
off
though
they
help
me
with
this
narrative
yet
candour
compels
me
to
tell
you
that
they
take
up
more
space
in
this
book
than
they
do
in
the
land
of
the
amazon
they
were
incidental
and
small
to
us
dominated
by
the
shadowing
presence
of
the
forest
we
have
been
on
the
river
nearly
a
week
but
our
steamer
s
decks
even
by
day
are
deserted
now
we
lean
overside
no
longer
looking
at
this
strange
country
the
heat
is
the
most
noteworthy
fact
and
drives
every
one
to
what
little
leeward
to
the
glare
there
is
our
cook
who
is
a
salamander
of
a
fellow
and
has
no
need
to
fear
the
possibilities
of
his
future
i
do
not
remember
he
ever
told
me
he
was
really
thoughtful
for
a
little
uncomfortable
one
day
when
at
work
on
our
dinner
glanced
at
his
thermometer
and
fled
in
terror
it
registered
he
begged
me
to
go
in
and
verify
it
and
once
inside
i
was
hardly
any
time
doing
that
we
have
such
days
without
a
breath
of
air
and
two
vivid
walls
of
still
jungle
and
between
them
a
yellow
river
serpentining
under
the
torrid
sun
and
a
silence
which
is
like
deafness
under
the
shadow
of
the
awning
aft
in
his
deck
chair
the
doctor
is
preparing
our
defences
by
sounding
a
profound
volume
on
tropical
diseases
this
gives
us
but
little
confidence
though
as
to
our
surgeon
recently
i
overheard
one
fireman
to
another
i
tell
yer
s
a
man
that
s
what
he
this
is
the
result
of
the
gin
with
the
quinine
yet
good
man
as
he
is
his
book
on
the
consequences
of
the
tropics
is
so
large
that
we
fear
we
all
can
not
escape
so
many
impediments
to
joy
but
our
health
s
guardian
is
careful
we
do
not
anticipate
anything
from
peeps
into
the
mysteries
he
never
leaves
his
big
book
about
much
as
some
of
us
would
like
to
see
the
pictures
in
it
after
what
the
donkeyman
told
us
this
is
how
it
was
donkey
in
spite
of
instructions
and
i
know
how
emphatic
the
skipper
usually
is
slept
on
deck
away
from
his
mosquito
bar
a
few
nights
ago
he
said
at
the
time
that
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
them
little
fanciful
biters
or
something
of
the
kind
i
have
no
doubt
the
doctor
would
have
had
some
trouble
in
making
clear
to
donkey
s
understanding
exactly
what
are
the
links
delicate
but
sure
between
mosquitoes
and
dissolution
and
decay
in
man
so
he
showed
donkey
a
picture
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
the
surgeon
preserves
the
usual
professional
reticence
in
the
affairs
of
his
patients
for
now
donkey
is
convinced
it
is
very
bad
to
sleep
outside
his
curtain
and
when
he
tries
to
tell
us
how
unwholesome
such
sleeping
can
be
just
at
the
point
when
he
gets
most
entertaining
his
vocabulary
wears
into
holes
and
tatters
you
could
not
conjure
that
man
from
his
curtain
now
no
not
if
you
showed
him
in
a
vision
cardiff
and
the
fairy
lights
of
all
its
dock
hotels
i
know
that
in
the
doctor
s
book
there
is
a
picture
of
a
negro
who
acquired
in
a
superb
way
a
wonderful
form
of
elephantiasis
for
the
doctor
showed
it
to
me
once
as
a
treat
when
he
thought
i
was
growing
slack
and
bored
we
require
now
such
childish
laughter
at
each
other
s
discomfiture
to
break
the
spell
of
this
land
into
which
we
are
sinking
deeper
still
the
forest
glides
by
it
is
a
shadow
on
the
mind
it
stands
over
us
an
insistent
riddle
every
morning
when
i
look
out
from
my
bunk
i
watch
it
all
day
drawn
against
my
will
and
as
day
is
dying
it
is
still
there
paramount
enigmatic
silent
its
question
implied
in
its
mere
me
again
on
the
next
day
still
with
its
mute
interrogation
we
have
been
passing
it
for
nearly
a
week
it
should
have
convinced
me
by
now
that
it
is
something
material
but
why
should
i
suppose
it
is
that
we
have
had
no
chance
to
examine
it
it
does
not
look
real
it
does
not
remind
me
of
anything
i
know
of
vegetation
when
you
sight
your
first
mountains
a
delicate
and
phantom
gleam
athwart
the
stars
are
you
reminded
of
the
substance
of
the
hills
i
have
been
watching
it
for
so
long
this
abiding
and
soundless
forest
that
now
i
think
it
is
like
the
sky
intangible
an
apparition
what
the
eye
sees
of
the
infinite
just
as
the
eye
sees
a
blue
colour
overhead
at
midday
and
the
glow
of
the
milky
way
at
night
for
the
mind
sees
this
forest
better
than
the
eye
the
mind
is
not
deceived
by
what
merely
shows
wherever
the
steamer
drives
the
forest
recedes
as
does
the
sky
at
sea
but
it
never
leaves
us
the
jungle
gains
nothing
and
loses
nothing
at
noon
it
is
only
a
sombre
thought
still
as
at
midnight
it
is
still
at
noon
so
obscure
and
dumb
a
presence
that
i
suspect
the
sun
does
not
illuminate
it
so
much
as
reveal
our
steamer
in
its
midst
we
are
revealed
instead
the
presence
sees
us
advancing
into
its
solitudes
a
small
busy
and
impudent
intruder
but
the
forest
does
not
greet
and
does
not
resent
us
it
regards
us
with
the
vacancy
of
large
composure
with
a
lofty
watchfulness
which
has
no
need
to
show
its
mind
i
think
it
knows
our
fears
of
its
domain
it
knows
the
secret
of
our
fate
it
makes
no
sign
the
pallid
boles
of
the
trees
the
sentinels
by
the
water
with
the
press
of
verdure
behind
them
stand
as
we
pass
like
soundless
exclamations
so
when
we
go
close
in
shore
i
find
myself
listening
for
a
chance
whisper
a
careless
betrayal
of
the
secret
there
is
not
a
murmur
in
the
host
though
once
a
white
bird
flew
yauping
from
a
tree
and
then
it
seemed
the
desolation
had
been
surprised
into
a
cry
a
prolonged
and
melancholy
admonition
following
that
the
silence
was
deepened
as
though
an
indiscretion
were
regretted
a
sustained
and
angry
protest
at
our
presence
would
have
been
natural
but
not
that
infinite
line
of
lofty
trees
darkly
superior
silently
watching
us
pass
one
night
we
anchored
off
the
south
shore
in
twenty
fathoms
but
close
under
the
trees
at
daybreak
we
stood
over
to
the
opposite
bank
the
river
here
was
of
great
width
the
north
coast
being
low
and
indistinct
these
tacks
across
stream
look
so
purposeless
in
a
place
where
there
are
no
men
and
all
the
water
looks
the
same
you
go
over
for
nothing
but
this
morning
high
above
the
land
ahead
some
specks
were
seen
drifting
like
fragments
of
burnt
paper
the
sport
of
an
idle
and
distant
wind
those
drifting
dots
were
urubus
the
vultures
generally
the
first
sign
that
a
settlement
is
near
to
come
upon
a
settlement
upon
the
amazons
is
like
landfall
at
sea
it
brings
all
on
deck
and
there
at
last
was
itacoatiara
or
serpa
from
one
of
the
infrequent
low
ferruginous
cliffs
of
this
river
the
jungle
had
been
cleared
and
on
that
short
range
of
modest
undulating
heights
which
displaced
the
green
palisades
with
soft
glowings
of
rose
cherry
and
orange
rock
the
sight
escaped
to
a
disorder
of
arboured
houses
like
a
disarray
of
little
white
cubes
serpa
was
in
appearance
half
a
basketful
of
white
bricks
shot
into
a
portico
of
the
forest
that
morning
was
no
inducement
to
exertion
but
when
an
indian
paddled
his
canoe
alongside
our
anchored
steamer
the
doctor
and
the
purser
got
into
it
and
away
the
hot
earth
would
be
a
change
from
hot
iron
besides
i
was
eager
for
my
first
walk
in
equatorial
woods
our
steamer
was
anchored
below
the
town
off
a
small
campo
or
clearing
the
native
swashed
his
canoe
into
a
margin
of
floating
plants
which
had
rounded
leaves
and
inflated
stalks
like
buoys
i
looked
at
them
and
indeed
at
the
least
thing
as
keenly
as
though
we
were
now
going
to
land
in
the
moon
nothing
should
escape
me
the
colour
of
the
mud
the
water
tepid
to
my
hand
the
bronze
canoeman
in
his
pair
of
old
cotton
pants
split
just
where
they
should
have
been
scrupulous
and
the
weeds
and
grass
i
would
drain
my
tropics
to
the
last
precious
drop
i
myself
was
seeing
what
i
had
thought
others
lucky
to
have
seen
it
was
like
being
born
into
the
world
as
an
understanding
adult
we
got
to
a
steep
bank
of
red
clay
fissured
by
the
heat
and
as
hard
as
brickwork
green
and
brown
lizards
whisked
before
us
as
we
broke
the
quiet
from
the
top
of
the
bank
the
anchored
steamer
looked
a
little
stranger
aboard
her
and
she
is
a
busy
village
now
she
appeared
but
a
mark
i
did
not
recognise
in
that
reticent
solitude
the
amazon
was
an
immensity
of
water
a
plain
of
burnished
silver
where
headlands
islands
and
lines
of
cliff
were
all
cut
in
one
level
mass
of
emerald
veined
with
white
the
canoe
going
downstream
appeared
to
dissolve
in
candent
vapour
cloudland
low
down
over
the
forest
to
the
south
a
far
disorder
of
violet
heights
waiting
to
fill
the
sky
at
sunset
and
to
shock
our
unimportance
then
with
convulsions
of
blue
flames
did
not
seem
more
aloof
and
inaccessible
to
me
than
our
immediate
surroundings
the
clearing
was
a
small
bay
in
the
jungle
a
few
statuesque
trees
buttressed
giants
were
isolated
in
its
centre
a
bunch
of
cattle
with
twisted
horns
stood
beneath
them
though
the
trees
gave
them
no
shade
for
each
grey
trunk
was
as
bare
of
branches
for
sixty
feet
of
its
length
as
a
stone
column
the
wall
of
the
jungle
was
quite
near
and
as
i
stood
watching
it
intently
i
could
hear
but
the
throb
of
my
own
life
the
faint
sibilation
of
insects
was
only
as
if
in
the
silence
you
heard
the
sharp
rays
of
the
sun
impinge
on
the
earth
your
finer
ear
caught
that
sound
when
you
forgot
the
ring
and
beat
of
your
body
it
was
something
below
mere
silence
we
approached
the
wall
to
the
west
as
a
path
went
through
the
harsh
swamp
herbage
that
way
and
entered
the
jungle
the
sun
went
out
almost
at
once
it
was
cellar
cool
under
the
trees
we
had
no
idea
where
the
path
would
lead
us
that
did
not
matter
no
doubt
it
would
be
the
place
desired
the
doctor
walked
ahead
and
i
could
just
see
his
helmet
the
way
was
so
narrow
and
uncertain
i
kept
missing
the
helmet
for
everything
in
the
solitude
was
strange
one
could
not
keep
an
eye
on
a
white
hat
on
one
s
first
equatorial
ramble
and
only
when
the
quiet
was
heavy
enough
to
be
a
burden
did
i
look
up
from
a
puzzling
leaf
or
some
busy
ants
to
find
myself
alone
there
was
a
feeling
that
you
were
being
watched
but
there
were
no
eyes
when
you
glanced
round
quickly
do
you
remember
that
dream
which
sometimes
came
when
we
were
children
there
were
i
remember
empty
corridors
prolonging
into
the
shadows
of
a
nameless
house
where
not
a
sign
showed
of
what
was
there
we
went
on
and
no
words
we
could
think
of
when
we
woke
could
tell
what
we
felt
when
we
looked
into
those
long
silent
aisles
of
the
house
without
a
name
for
we
knew
something
was
there
but
there
was
no
telling
what
the
thing
would
be
like
when
it
showed
that
is
your
sensation
in
a
first
walk
in
a
brazilian
forest
i
stopped
at
lianas
and
curious
foliage
trying
to
trace
them
to
a
beginning
but
rarely
with
any
success
there
were
some
mantis
which
commenced
to
run
on
a
tree
while
i
was
examining
its
bark
they
were
like
flakes
of
the
bark
for
a
moment
the
tree
seemed
to
quiver
its
hide
at
my
irritating
touch
then
the
doctor
called
and
i
pushed
along
to
find
him
stooping
over
a
land
snail
the
size
of
a
man
s
fist
which
rather
puzzled
him
for
it
had
what
he
called
an
operculum
that
is
a
cap
such
as
a
winkle
s
only
in
this
case
it
was
as
large
as
a
crown
piece
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
the
operculum
for
my
knowledge
of
such
things
is
small
but
i
did
feel
this
was
the
only
twelfth
birthday
which
had
come
to
me
for
many
years
presently
we
saw
light
as
you
would
from
the
interior
of
a
tunnel
some
beams
of
sunshine
slanted
from
a
break
in
the
roof
to
where
a
tree
had
fallen
making
a
bridge
for
us
across
an
igaripe
a
stream
that
is
large
enough
to
be
a
way
for
a
canoe
the
sundered
buttressed
roots
of
the
tree
formed
a
steep
climb
to
begin
with
but
the
buttresses
going
straight
along
the
trunk
as
handrails
made
crossing
the
bridge
an
easy
matter
raising
my
hand
to
a
root
which
was
hot
in
the
sun
and
watching
a
helicon
butterfly
a
black
and
yellow
fellow
which
settled
near
us
slowly
open
and
shut
his
wings
i
jumped
because
it
felt
as
though
a
lighted
match
had
dropped
into
my
sleeve
but
i
couldn
t
douse
it
it
burned
in
ten
places
at
once
it
was
a
first
lesson
in
constant
watchfulness
in
this
new
world
i
had
placed
my
hand
in
a
swarm
of
inconspicuous
fire
ants
the
dead
tree
was
alive
with
them
and
our
passage
quickened
we
rubbed
ourselves
hysterically
for
the
doctor
had
got
some
too
and
there
was
no
professional
reserve
about
him
that
time
after
crossing
the
igaripe
the
character
of
the
forest
changed
it
was
now
a
growth
of
wild
cacao
trees
nothing
grew
beneath
them
the
floor
was
a
black
paste
littered
with
dead
sticks
the
woods
were
more
open
but
darker
and
more
dank
than
before
the
sooty
limbs
of
the
cacao
trees
grew
low
and
filled
the
view
ahead
with
a
perplexity
of
leafless
and
tortured
boughs
they
were
hung
about
with
fruit
pendent
lamps
lit
with
a
pale
greenish
light
we
saw
nothing
move
there
but
two
delicate
butterflies
which
had
transparent
wings
with
opaque
crimson
spots
such
as
might
have
been
served
titania
herself
yet
the
gloom
and
black
ooze
and
the
eerie
globes
with
their
illusion
of
light
hung
upon
distorted
shapes
was
more
the
home
of
the
fabulous
sucuruja
the
serpent
which
is
forty
feet
long
a
dry
stick
snapping
underfoot
had
the
same
effect
as
that
crash
which
resounds
for
some
embarrassing
seconds
when
your
umbrella
drops
in
a
gallery
of
the
british
museum
the
impulse
was
to
apologise
to
something
we
had
been
so
long
in
the
twilight
recoiling
at
nameless
objects
in
the
path
a
monstrous
legume
perhaps
a
yard
long
and
coiled
like
a
reptile
seeing
things
only
with
a
second
look
that
the
sudden
entrance
into
a
malocal
a
forest
clearing
which
as
though
it
were
a
reservoir
the
sun
had
filled
with
bright
light
was
like
a
plunge
into
a
warm
fluid
and
lustrous
element
in
the
clearing
were
the
huts
of
an
indian
village
only
the
roofs
could
be
seen
through
some
plantations
of
bananas
around
the
clearing
a
side
of
which
was
cut
off
by
a
stream
was
the
overshadowing
green
presence
some
chocolate
babies
as
serious
as
gnomes
looked
up
as
we
came
into
daylight
opened
their
eyes
wide
and
fled
up
the
path
between
the
plantains
if
i
could
sing
i
would
sing
the
banana
it
has
the
loveliest
leaf
i
know
i
feel
intemperate
about
it
because
i
came
upon
it
after
our
passage
through
a
wood
which
could
have
been
underground
a
tangle
of
bare
roots
joining
floor
and
ceiling
in
limitless
caverns
we
stood
looking
at
the
plantation
till
our
mind
was
fed
with
grace
and
light
the
plantain
jets
upwards
with
a
copious
stem
and
the
fountain
returns
in
broad
rippled
pennants
falling
outwardly
refined
to
points
when
the
impulse
is
lost
a
world
could
not
be
old
on
which
such
a
plant
grows
it
is
sure
evidence
of
earth
s
vitality
to
look
at
it
you
would
not
think
that
growing
is
a
long
process
a
matter
of
months
and
natural
difficulties
the
plantain
is
an
instant
and
joyous
answer
to
the
sun
the
midribs
of
the
leaves
powerful
but
resilient
held
aloft
in
generous
arches
the
broad
planes
of
translucent
green
substance
it
is
not
a
fragile
and
dainty
thing
except
in
colour
and
form
it
is
lush
and
solid
though
its
ascent
is
so
aerial
and
its
form
is
content
to
the
eye
there
is
no
green
like
that
of
its
leaves
except
at
sea
the
stout
midribs
are
sometimes
rosy
but
the
banners
they
hold
well
above
your
upturned
face
are
as
the
crest
of
a
wave
in
the
moment
of
collapse
the
day
showing
through
its
fluid
glass
and
after
the
place
of
dead
matter
and
mummied
husks
in
gloom
where
we
had
been
wandering
this
burst
of
leaves
in
full
light
was
a
return
to
life
we
continued
along
the
path
in
the
way
of
the
vanished
children
among
the
bananas
were
some
rubber
trees
their
pale
trunks
scored
with
brown
wounds
and
under
some
of
the
incisions
small
tin
cups
adhered
fastened
there
with
clay
in
most
of
the
cups
the
collected
latex
was
congealed
for
the
cups
were
half
full
of
which
was
alive
with
mosquito
larvæ
the
path
led
to
the
top
of
the
river
bank
the
stream
was
narrow
but
full
and
deep
a
number
of
women
and
children
were
bathing
below
and
they
looked
up
stolidly
as
we
appeared
some
were
negligent
on
the
grass
sunning
themselves
others
were
combing
their
long
straight
hair
over
their
and
bodies
the
figures
of
the
women
were
full
lissom
and
rounded
and
they
posed
as
if
they
were
aware
that
this
place
was
theirs
they
were
as
unconscious
of
their
grace
as
animals
they
looked
round
and
up
at
us
and
one
stayed
her
hand
her
comb
half
through
the
length
of
her
hair
and
all
gazed
intently
at
us
with
faces
having
no
expression
but
a
little
surprise
then
they
turned
again
to
proceed
with
their
toilets
and
their
gossip
they
looked
as
proper
with
their
brown
and
satiny
limbs
and
bodies
in
the
secluded
and
sunny
arbour
where
the
water
ran
framed
in
exuberant
tropical
foliage
as
a
herd
of
deer
i
had
never
seen
primitive
man
in
his
native
place
till
then
there
he
was
as
at
the
beginning
and
i
saw
with
a
new
respect
from
what
a
splendid
creature
we
are
derived
it
was
i
am
glad
to
say
to
cheer
the
existence
of
these
people
that
i
had
put
money
in
a
church
plate
at
poplar
poplar
you
may
have
heard
is
a
parish
in
civilisation
where
an
organised
community
is
able
through
its
heritage
of
the
best
of
two
thousand
years
of
religion
science
commerce
and
politics
to
eke
out
to
a
finish
the
lives
of
its
members
warped
as
they
so
often
are
by
arid
dispensations
of
providence
with
the
humane
poor
law
the
poor
law
is
the
civilised
man
s
ironic
rebuke
to
a
parsimonious
creator
it
is
a
jest
which
will
ruin
the
solemnity
of
the
judgment
day
only
the
man
of
long
culture
could
think
of
such
a
shattering
insult
to
the
all
wise
who
made
this
earth
too
small
for
the
children
he
continues
to
send
to
it
trailing
their
clouds
of
glory
which
prove
a
sad
hindrance
and
get
so
fouled
in
the
fight
for
standing
room
on
their
arrival
but
these
savages
of
the
brazilian
forest
know
nothing
of
the
immortal
joke
conceived
by
their
cleverer
brothers
they
have
all
they
want
experience
has
not
taught
them
to
devise
such
a
cosmic
mock
as
a
poor
law
how
do
these
poor
savages
live
then
who
have
not
been
vouchsafed
such
light
they
pluck
bananas
i
suppose
and
eat
them
swinging
in
hammocks
they
live
a
purely
animal
existence
more
than
that
i
even
hear
that
should
you
find
a
child
hungry
in
an
indian
village
you
may
be
sure
all
the
strong
men
there
are
hungry
too
i
was
not
able
to
prove
that
yet
it
may
be
true
there
are
people
to
whom
the
law
that
the
fittest
must
survive
has
not
yet
been
helpfully
revealed
this
is
really
the
doctor
s
fault
i
should
never
have
thought
of
poplar
if
he
had
not
wondered
aloud
how
those
bathers
under
the
palms
managed
without
a
workhouse
behind
us
were
the
shelters
of
these
settled
indians
the
cabaclos
as
they
are
called
in
brazil
literally
copper
coloured
each
house
was
but
a
square
roof
of
the
fronds
of
a
species
of
attalea
palm
upheld
at
each
corner
by
poles
seven
feet
high
the
houses
had
no
sides
but
were
quite
open
except
that
some
had
a
quarter
of
the
interior
partitioned
off
with
a
screen
of
leaves
there
was
a
rough
attempt
at
a
garden
about
each
dwelling
with
rose
bushes
and
coleas
in
the
midst
of
gourds
and
patches
of
maize
the
roses
were
scented
and
of
the
single
briar
kind
we
entered
one
of
the
dwellings
and
surprised
a
young
woman
within
who
was
swinging
in
a
hammock
smoking
a
native
pipe
of
red
clay
through
a
grass
stem
one
fine
limb
free
of
her
cotton
gown
to
the
thigh
hung
indolently
over
the
hammock
the
toes
touching
the
earth
and
giving
the
couch
movement
her
black
hair
all
at
first
we
could
see
of
her
head
nearly
reached
the
ground
a
girl
innocent
from
head
to
feet
saw
us
enter
and
cried
to
her
mother
who
rose
in
the
hammock
threw
her
gown
over
her
leg
smiled
gravely
at
us
and
alighted
to
vanish
behind
the
screen
with
the
child
reappearing
presently
with
the
girl
neatly
attired
other
children
came
and
soon
had
confidence
to
examine
us
closely
and
critically
grave
little
mortals
with
eyes
which
spoke
the
only
language
i
understood
there
the
men
and
women
who
gathered
stood
behind
the
children
smiling
sadly
and
kindly
they
were
gentle
undemonstrative
and
observant
with
features
of
the
conventional
indian
type
the
men
were
spare
and
lithe
of
medium
height
wearing
only
shorts
tied
with
string
below
their
bronze
busts
the
women
were
of
fuller
build
with
heavier
but
more
cheerful
features
and
each
was
dressed
in
a
single
cotton
garment
open
above
revealing
the
breasts
the
noon
shadows
of
the
hut
and
the
trees
were
deep
as
the
stains
of
ink
a
tray
of
mandioca
root
farinha
was
set
in
the
hot
sun
to
dry
under
a
gourd
tree
was
a
heap
of
turtle
shells
a
little
game
a
capybara
and
a
bird
like
a
crow
with
a
brown
rump
were
hung
on
the
screen
but
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
the
house
in
the
forest
was
its
pets
a
pair
of
parraquets
ran
in
and
out
the
bushes
like
green
mice
my
helmet
was
tipped
over
my
eyes
and
looking
upwards
there
was
an
audience
of
monkeys
in
the
shadow
quite
beside
themselves
with
curiosity
my
sudden
movement
sent
them
off
like
fireworks
one
was
a
most
engaging
little
fellow
a
tamarin
slightly
larger
than
a
squirrel
presently
he
found
courage
to
come
closer
with
a
companion
a
brown
monkey
of
his
own
size
as
they
sat
side
by
side
the
doctor
pointed
out
that
the
expressions
in
the
faces
of
these
monkeys
showed
temperaments
separating
them
even
more
widely
than
they
were
separated
by
those
physical
differences
which
made
them
species
i
saw
at
once
with
some
pleasure
and
a
little
vanity
that
i
might
be
more
nearly
related
to
the
friendly
cabaclos
than
i
am
to
some
people
in
england
the
brown
chap
would
be
no
doubt
a
master
of
industry
on
the
tree
tops
keeping
a
whole
tree
to
himself
and
living
on
nuts
which
others
gathered
you
could
see
it
in
his
keen
and
domineering
look
and
in
the
quick
casual
way
he
crowded
his
fellow
who
always
made
room
for
him
i
have
seen
such
a
face
and
such
manners
in
great
industrial
centres
they
are
the
marks
of
the
ablest
and
best
who
get
on
his
hard
eager
eyes
showed
censoriousness
cruelty
and
acquisitiveness
but
his
companion
with
a
sooty
and
hairless
face
and
black
hair
parted
in
the
middle
of
a
frail
forehead
was
a
pal
of
ours
and
knew
it
the
brown
midget
showed
angry
distrust
of
us
knowing
what
devilry
was
in
his
own
mind
but
the
black
though
more
delicate
and
nervous
a
monkey
his
mind
being
innocent
of
secret
plots
had
gentleness
and
faith
in
his
looks
and
showed
a
laughable
and
welcome
curiosity
in
us
he
made
friendly
the
harsh
and
menacing
chatter
of
the
perfectly
his
pure
soul
giving
him
quiethood
examined
us
in
a
brotherly
way
with
an
ebon
paw
which
was
as
small
and
fragile
as
a
black
fairy
s
a
jabiru
stork
stood
on
one
leg
beak
on
breast
meditating
caring
nothing
for
all
that
was
outside
its
ruminating
mind
there
were
parrots
on
the
of
the
roof
on
the
floor
on
the
shoulders
of
the
women
and
in
the
hands
of
the
children
and
they
were
getting
an
interesting
time
through
the
monkeys
when
their
faces
were
not
cocked
sideways
at
us
in
a
knowing
fashion
and
what
looked
like
a
crow
was
giving
bitter
and
ruthless
chase
to
a
young
agouti
in
and
out
of
the
bare
feet
of
the
company
i
have
never
seen
creatures
so
tame
but
indian
women
as
i
learned
afterwards
have
a
fine
gift
for
winning
the
confidence
of
wild
things
and
that
afternoon
they
took
hold
of
the
creatures
anyhow
and
anywhere
to
bring
them
for
our
inspection
without
the
captives
showing
the
least
alarm
or
anger
there
were
the
dogs
too
but
they
were
like
all
the
dogs
we
saw
in
brazil
looking
sorry
for
themselves
and
they
sat
about
in
case
they
should
fall
if
they
attempted
to
stand
our
audience
broke
up
suddenly
in
an
uproar
of
protests
to
chase
the
brown
monkey
who
was
towing
a
frantic
parrot
by
the
tail
we
continued
our
walk
entering
the
forest
again
on
another
path
here
the
growth
was
secondary
and
the
underbush
dense
on
both
sides
of
the
trail
the
voices
of
the
village
stopped
as
we
entered
the
shades
and
there
was
no
more
sound
except
when
a
bird
scurried
away
heavily
and
again
when
some
cicadas
the
scissors
grinders
suddenly
sprang
an
astonishing
whirring
from
a
tree
the
sound
was
as
loud
as
that
of
a
locomotive
letting
steam
escape
in
a
covered
station
at
a
clearing
so
small
that
the
roof
of
the
jungle
had
been
but
little
broken
where
a
hut
stood
as
though
at
a
sunk
in
a
depth
of
trees
we
turned
back
that
deep
well
in
the
trees
contained
but
little
light
for
already
it
was
being
choked
with
vines
the
hut
was
of
the
usual
light
construction
though
its
sides
were
of
leaves
as
well
as
its
roof
i
think
it
was
the
most
melancholy
dwelling
i
have
ever
happened
on
in
my
wanderings
it
did
not
look
as
though
it
had
been
long
deserted
there
were
ashes
and
a
broken
outside
it
the
entrance
was
veiled
with
gross
spiders
webs
on
the
earth
floor
within
were
puddles
of
rain
round
it
the
forest
stood
like
night
in
abeyance
the
tree
tops
overhung
silently
intent
on
what
man
had
been
doing
at
their
feet
a
child
s
chemise
was
stretched
on
a
thorn
and
close
by
was
a
small
grave
separated
by
little
sticks
from
the
secular
earth
a
dead
plant
was
in
the
centre
of
the
grave
and
a
crude
wooden
crucifix
we
had
plenty
of
opportunities
for
exploring
serpa
for
the
amazon
that
rainy
season
was
slow
in
rising
and
consequently
it
would
have
been
unsafe
for
us
to
venture
into
the
madeira
the
tributary
would
have
been
full
but
it
was
necessary
for
the
waters
of
the
main
stream
to
dam
and
heighten
the
flood
of
its
tributary
before
we
could
trust
our
draught
there
we
were
nine
days
at
serpa
the
amazon
would
rise
as
much
as
a
foot
one
day
and
our
distance
from
the
shore
would
increase
perceptibly
with
strong
whirling
eddies
which
made
the
trip
ashore
more
difficult
then
it
would
fall
again
some
of
the
yellow
amazon
porpoises
showed
alongside
occasionally
and
alligators
floated
about
though
nothing
was
seen
of
them
but
their
snouts
serpa
is
a
small
but
growing
place
it
was
but
a
missionary
settlement
of
abacaxis
indians
from
the
madeira
in
and
was
called
itacoatiara
when
i
was
there
it
was
renewing
its
old
importance
because
the
railway
undertaking
had
placed
a
depôt
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
village
the
doctor
and
i
spent
many
memorable
days
in
its
neighbourhood
and
sauntering
though
mosquitoes
anopeline
and
culex
are
as
common
here
as
elsewhere
in
the
lighters
which
came
alongside
with
cargo
for
us
conveyed
clouds
of
them
and
they
took
possession
of
every
dark
nook
of
the
capella
is
noteworthy
that
serpa
has
the
reputation
in
amazonas
of
a
health
resort
i
could
find
no
explanation
of
that
there
was
malaria
at
serpa
of
course
but
compared
with
the
really
lethal
country
a
country
not
so
different
in
appearance
and
climate
of
the
upper
madeira
the
salubrity
of
serpa
is
perplexing
that
virulent
form
of
malaria
peculiar
to
some
tropical
localities
is
a
phenomenon
which
medical
research
has
not
yet
explained
in
the
almost
unexplored
region
of
the
rio
madeira
the
fever
is
certain
to
every
traveller
though
the
land
is
largely
without
inhabitants
and
it
is
almost
equally
certain
that
it
will
be
of
the
malignant
type
yet
at
an
old
settlement
like
serpa
where
probably
every
inhabitant
has
had
malaria
and
every
mosquito
is
likely
to
be
a
host
the
fever
is
but
mild
and
the
traveller
may
escape
it
entirely
by
now
you
will
be
asking
what
itacoatiara
is
like
that
community
contentedly
lost
in
the
secret
forest
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
learn
unless
in
the
happy
future
you
and
i
select
a
few
friends
a
few
books
and
erect
some
houses
of
palm
leaves
to
protect
us
from
the
too
vigorous
sun
there
and
so
secure
from
all
the
really
urgent
and
important
matters
which
do
not
matter
a
twinkle
to
the
eternal
stars
noon
it
far
and
secure
until
the
time
comes
for
the
gentle
villagers
to
carry
us
out
and
forget
us
remembering
us
again
when
the
annual
day
of
the
dead
comes
round
they
will
leave
some
comfortable
candles
above
us
that
night
there
the
earth
is
a
warm
and
luscious
body
the
lazy
paths
are
cool
with
groves
and
in
the
middle
hours
of
the
sun
when
only
a
few
butterflies
are
abroad
and
the
grasshoppers
are
shrilling
in
the
quiet
you
swing
in
a
hammock
under
a
air
has
been
through
some
tree
in
gossip
and
drink
coffee
beyond
the
path
of
the
village
there
knows
what
not
even
the
royal
geographical
society
one
heard
of
a
large
and
mysterious
lake
a
day
s
journey
inland
nobody
knew
anything
about
it
nobody
cared
one
old
man
once
when
hunting
saw
its
mirror
through
the
forest
s
aisles
and
heard
the
multitude
of
its
birds
the
foreshore
of
the
village
is
rugged
with
boulders
richly
tinctured
with
iron
oxide
and
often
having
a
scoriaceous
surface
there
we
would
land
and
scramble
up
to
a
street
which
ends
on
the
height
above
the
river
it
is
a
broad
road
with
white
substantial
houses
on
either
side
the
dwellings
and
stores
have
no
windows
but
are
built
with
open
fronts
for
ventilation
this
is
serpa
s
main
street
it
is
shaded
with
avenues
of
trees
in
the
narrower
side
turnings
the
trees
meet
to
form
arcades
one
day
we
saw
such
an
avenue
covered
with
yellow
blossoms
with
solid
wheels
stand
in
the
walks
the
sunlight
broken
in
the
leaves
of
the
trees
patterned
the
roads
with
white
fire
and
so
dappled
the
cattle
that
they
were
obscure
you
saw
the
oxen
only
when
they
moved
there
is
a
large
square
in
the
centre
of
the
village
where
stands
the
church
a
white
simple
building
with
an
open
belfry
in
which
the
bell
hangs
plain
bright
with
verdigris
about
here
the
merchants
and
tradesmen
of
serpa
have
their
places
the
men
hearty
and
friendly
souls
walk
abroad
in
clean
linen
suits
and
straw
hats
and
their
ladies
pallid
slight
but
often
singularly
beautiful
are
dressed
as
europeans
but
without
hats
sometimes
when
out
walking
late
in
the
day
a
lady
would
have
a
scarlet
flower
in
her
hair
by
the
foreshore
were
the
cabins
of
mud
and
wood
of
the
negroes
beyond
the
town
the
roads
run
through
the
clearings
and
end
on
the
forest
in
the
clearings
were
the
huts
wattle
and
daub
and
of
leaves
of
the
settled
indians
and
these
were
often
prettily
placed
beneath
groups
of
graceful
palms
it
was
in
the
last
direction
that
most
often
we
made
our
way
with
our
butterfly
nets
while
other
folk
were
sleeping
during
the
sun
s
height
the
humid
heat
i
suppose
was
really
a
trial
one
did
perspire
in
an
alarming
way
and
with
the
least
exertion
the
doctor
who
carries
substance
would
have
dark
patches
in
his
khaki
uniform
and
would
wonder
with
foreboding
whether
any
more
in
this
life
he
would
catch
hold
of
a
cold
jug
which
held
a
straight
pint
in
which
ice
tinkled
but
to
me
the
illumination
the
heat
the
odour
and
the
quiethood
of
those
noons
made
life
a
great
prize
i
will
say
that
my
comrade
the
doctor
did
much
to
make
it
so
with
his
gentle
fun
and
his
wide
knowledge
of
there
was
so
much
wherever
we
went
to
keep
me
on
the
magic
side
of
time
and
out
of
its
shadow
on
the
west
of
the
town
were
some
huts
with
plantations
of
bananas
pineapples
papaws
and
maize
where
blossomed
cannas
mimosas
and
where
other
unseen
blooms
especially
after
rain
made
breathing
a
sensuous
pleasure
there
we
tried
to
intercept
the
flight
of
big
sulphur
and
orange
butterflies
though
never
with
success
we
had
more
success
with
the
butterflies
in
the
clearings
where
some
new
huts
stood
beyond
the
village
over
the
stagnant
pools
in
those
open
spaces
dragonflies
hovered
fellows
that
moved
when
we
approached
like
lines
of
red
light
the
butterflies
particularly
a
vermilion
beauty
with
black
bars
on
his
wings
and
a
swift
flier
used
to
settle
and
gem
the
mud
about
these
pools
other
species
frequented
the
flowering
shrubs
which
had
grown
over
the
burnt
wreckage
and
stumps
of
the
forest
that
area
was
full
of
insects
and
birds
there
we
saw
daily
the
sauba
ants
sometimes
called
the
parasol
ants
in
endless
processions
each
ant
holding
a
piece
of
leaf
the
size
of
a
sixpenny
bit
over
its
tiny
body
tanagers
shot
amongst
the
bushes
like
blue
projectiles
we
saw
a
ficus
there
on
one
occasion
of
fair
size
with
large
leathery
leaves
which
carried
a
colony
of
remarkable
caterpillars
each
about
seven
inches
long
thick
in
proportion
blue
black
in
colour
with
yellow
stripes
and
a
coral
head
and
filaments
at
the
latter
end
they
were
pugnacious
worms
fighting
each
other
desperately
when
two
met
on
a
leaf
the
larvæ
stripped
that
tree
in
a
day
we
were
not
always
sure
that
the
people
in
this
part
of
serpa
were
friendly
mostly
they
were
varying
mixtures
of
indian
and
negro
and
no
doubt
very
superstitious
the
rodent
s
foot
was
commonly
worn
by
the
women
who
if
we
took
notice
of
their
children
sometimes
would
spit
to
avert
the
evil
eye
but
when
the
thunder
clouds
banked
close
and
the
air
being
still
became
loaded
with
the
scent
of
the
wood
fires
of
the
villagers
promising
rain
we
would
enter
a
hut
and
then
always
found
we
were
welcome
even
when
kept
to
the
ship
for
any
reason
this
country
offered
constant
new
things
to
keep
our
thoughts
moving
a
regatao
the
river
pedlar
would
bring
his
roomy
montario
the
gipsy
van
of
the
river
his
family
wife
the
grandmother
and
the
sad
shy
little
offer
us
fruits
and
perhaps
his
monkey
and
parrots
gradually
the
capella
added
to
her
company
the
chief
bought
a
parrot
which
had
many
indian
and
portuguese
phrases
it
tried
to
climb
a
funnel
guy
in
escaping
the
curiosity
of
our
terrier
and
fell
into
the
river
we
fished
her
out
with
a
bucket
the
vampire
bats
came
aboard
every
night
they
were
not
very
terrible
creatures
to
look
at
but
we
discovered
they
frequented
the
forecastle
for
no
good
purpose
again
stories
filtered
through
to
us
of
sickness
on
the
madeira
and
abruptly
they
gave
the
palms
and
the
sunsets
a
new
light
one
man
was
brought
in
from
beyond
and
died
of
this
shook
the
nerves
of
one
of
our
brazilian
pilots
and
he
refused
to
go
beyond
where
we
were
as
for
me
there
at
serpa
the
capella
was
at
anchor
and
we
were
not
near
the
madeira
and
seemed
never
likely
to
go
i
watched
the
sunsets
the
brief
cool
evenings
prompted
me
fever
in
the
future
or
not
to
praise
and
grace
crickets
chirped
everywhere
on
the
ship
then
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
sparks
of
fireflies
you
could
smell
this
good
earth
there
was
one
sunset
when
the
overspreading
of
violet
clouds
would
have
shut
out
the
day
quite
but
that
the
canopy
was
not
closely
adjusted
to
the
low
barrier
of
forest
to
the
westward
through
that
narrow
chink
a
yellow
light
streamed
and
traced
shapes
on
the
lurid
walls
and
roof
which
narrowly
enclosed
us
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
most
alarming
of
our
daily
electrical
storms
there
was
no
wind
serpa
and
all
the
coast
facing
that
rift
where
the
light
entered
our
prison
stood
prominent
and
strange
and
surprised
us
as
much
as
if
we
had
not
looked
in
that
direction
till
then
the
curtain
dropped
behind
the
forest
and
all
light
was
shut
out
we
could
not
see
across
the
ship
knowing
how
strong
and
bright
could
be
the
electrical
discharges
though
they
were
rarely
accompanied
by
thunder
when
not
heralded
in
so
portentous
a
way
we
waited
with
some
anxiety
for
this
display
to
begin
it
began
over
the
trees
behind
serpa
blue
fire
flickered
low
down
and
was
quickly
doused
then
a
crack
of
light
sprang
across
the
inverted
black
bowl
from
east
to
west
in
three
quick
movements
its
instant
ramifications
fractured
all
the
roof
in
a
network
of
dazzling
blue
lines
the
reticulations
of
light
were
fleeting
but
never
gone
night
contracted
and
expanded
and
the
sharp
sounds
which
were
not
like
thunder
might
have
been
the
tumbling
flinders
of
night
s
roof
we
saw
not
only
the
river
and
the
shapes
of
the
trees
and
the
village
as
in
wavering
daylight
but
their
colours
one
flash
sheeted
the
heavens
and
its
overbright
glare
extinguished
everything
it
came
with
an
explosion
like
the
firing
of
a
great
gun
close
to
our
ears
and
for
a
time
we
thought
the
ship
was
struck
in
this
effort
the
storm
exhausted
itself
the
day
before
we
left
for
the
madeira
we
took
aboard
sixty
head
of
cattle
they
were
wild
things
which
had
been
collected
in
the
campo
with
great
difficulty
and
driven
into
lighters
a
rope
was
dropped
over
the
horns
of
each
beast
this
was
attached
to
a
crane
hook
the
winch
was
started
and
up
the
poor
wretch
came
all
its
weight
on
its
horns
bumping
inertly
against
the
ship
s
side
in
its
passage
like
a
bale
and
was
then
dumped
in
a
heap
on
deck
this
treatment
seemed
to
subdue
it
each
quietly
submitted
to
a
halter
several
lost
horns
and
one
hurt
its
leg
and
had
to
be
dragged
to
its
place
but
to
our
great
were
watching
the
scene
from
the
brazilian
herdsmen
on
the
lighter
shouted
an
anxious
warning
to
their
fellows
on
our
deck
as
a
small
black
heifer
a
potbellied
lump
with
a
stretched
neck
rotated
in
her
unusual
efforts
to
free
her
horns
she
even
bellowed
she
bumped
heavily
against
the
ship
s
side
and
tried
desperately
to
find
her
feet
she
was
and
i
offered
up
thanks
for
this
benefit
most
plainly
an
implacable
rebel
the
cattlemen
as
punishment
for
the
trouble
she
had
given
them
ashore
kept
her
dangling
over
the
deck
and
one
got
level
with
her
face
and
mocked
her
slapping
her
nose
she
actually
defied
him
though
she
was
quite
helpless
with
some
minatory
sounds
she
was
no
cow
she
was
insurrection
she
was
the
hate
for
tyrants
incarnated
they
dropped
her
she
was
up
and
away
like
a
cat
straight
for
the
winchman
and
tried
to
get
the
winch
out
of
her
path
bellowing
as
she
worked
she
put
everybody
on
that
deck
in
the
shrouds
or
on
the
forecastle
head
as
she
trotted
round
with
her
tail
up
looking
for
brutes
to
put
them
to
death
none
of
the
cows
of
course
helped
her
by
a
trick
she
was
caught
and
her
horns
were
lashed
down
to
a
ring
bolt
in
a
hatch
coaming
then
she
tried
to
kick
all
who
passed
if
the
rest
of
the
cattle
had
been
like
her
none
would
have
suffered
alas
they
were
probably
all
scientific
evolutionists
content
to
wait
for
men
to
become
kindly
by
slow
and
natural
uplift
and
gravely
deprecated
the
action
of
the
heifer
from
which
as
peaceful
cows
they
disassociated
themselves
the
indian
says
that
if
he
eats
a
morsel
of
tiger
he
becomes
fierce
and
strong
i
have
not
the
faith
of
the
indian
or
i
would
have
begged
the
heart
of
that
heifer
and
of
it
i
would
have
brewed
gallons
of
precious
liquor
and
brought
it
home
in
jars
for
incomparable
gifts
to
the
meek
at
heart
who
always
do
what
the
herdsmen
tell
them
the
doctor
and
i
made
a
pet
of
that
black
cow
to
the
extent
of
seeing
she
got
her
rations
regularly
it
was
no
joke
wading
through
manure
among
a
press
of
nervous
animals
on
a
ship
s
deck
in
the
tropics
in
order
to
see
that
a
brave
creature
was
justly
dealt
with
particularly
as
she
swore
violently
whenever
she
saw
us
looking
up
from
her
tightly
tethered
head
with
eyes
full
of
unabated
fury
and
tried
to
get
at
us
on
the
hatch
above
her
bound
though
she
was
what
a
heart
for
her
head
was
fixed
immovably
unlike
the
others
yet
till
we
arrived
at
porto
velho
she
kept
her
fierce
spirit
often
kicking
over
her
water
bucket
with
her
forefeet
curse
their
charity
with
two
new
pilots
we
upanchored
next
morning
and
full
of
cattle
flies
and
new
odours
and
a
gang
of
cattlemen
who
at
least
appeared
villainous
and
carried
long
knives
the
capella
continued
up
stream
for
the
madeira
the
cattle
were
sheltered
as
far
as
possible
with
awnings
improvised
from
spare
canvas
and
their
fodder
was
bales
of
american
hay
the
skipper
did
his
best
to
meliorate
the
harsh
native
methods
with
dumb
things
and
now
it
seems
time
to
explain
why
we
are
bound
for
the
centre
of
the
american
continent
where
the
unexplored
jungle
still
persists
and
disease
or
death
so
the
legends
tell
us
come
to
all
white
men
who
stay
there
for
but
a
few
months
if
you
will
get
your
map
of
the
brazils
begin
from
para
and
cruise
along
the
amazon
to
the
madeira
turn
south
just
before
you
have
reached
santo
antonio
on
the
tributary
stream
you
have
traversed
the
ultimate
wilderness
of
a
continent
and
stand
on
the
threshold
of
bolivia
almost
under
the
shadow
of
the
andes
if
you
find
any
pleasure
in
maps
flying
in
shoes
of
that
kind
when
affairs
pursue
you
too
urgently
and
i
suppose
you
do
or
you
would
not
be
so
far
into
this
narrative
you
will
hardly
thank
me
when
i
tell
you
it
is
possible
for
an
ocean
steamer
exceeding
feet
in
draught
to
make
such
a
journey
and
so
break
the
romance
of
the
obscure
place
at
the
end
of
it
but
it
must
be
said
even
one
who
travels
for
fun
should
keep
to
the
truth
in
the
matter
of
a
ship
s
draught
as
a
reasonable
being
you
would
prefer
to
believe
the
map
and
that
clearly
shows
the
only
way
there
when
the
chance
comes
for
you
to
take
it
must
be
by
canoe
a
long
and
arduous
journey
to
a
seclusion
remote
and
so
the
more
deeply
desired
it
certainly
hurts
our
faith
in
a
favourite
chart
to
find
that
its
seaboard
is
no
barrier
to
modern
traffic
but
that
journeying
over
those
pink
and
yellow
inland
areas
which
should
have
no
traffic
with
great
ships
a
large
cargo
steamer
full
of
welsh
coal
can
come
to
an
anchorage
still
with
many
fathoms
under
her
at
a
point
where
the
cartographer
for
lack
of
and
other
humane
symbols
has
set
the
word
forest
with
the
letters
spread
widely
to
the
full
extent
of
his
ignorance
and
so
promised
us
sanctuary
in
plenty
i
suppose
that
in
a
few
years
those
remote
wilds
somehow
cleared
of
indians
jungle
and
i
do
not
see
how
all
this
can
be
have
no
further
interest
for
us
because
it
will
possess
many
of
the
common
disadvantages
of
civilisation
s
benefits
it
will
be
a
point
on
a
regular
route
of
commerce
i
am
really
sorry
for
you
but
in
the
sad
and
cruel
code
of
the
sailor
i
can
only
reply
as
jack
did
when
he
got
the
sole
rag
of
beef
in
the
hash
blow
you
bill
i
m
all
i
had
the
fortune
to
go
when
the
route
was
still
much
as
it
was
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
but
after
all
you
question
me
hopeful
yet
nothing
can
be
done
with
tons
of
welsh
cargo
in
a
people
with
the
nose
for
dollars
can
do
wonders
it
would
be
unwise
to
back
such
a
doughty
opponent
as
the
pristine
jungle
with
its
malaria
against
people
who
smell
money
there
in
the
early
seventies
there
was
a
man
with
one
idea
colonel
george
church
his
idea
was
to
give
to
bolivia
which
the
andes
shuts
out
from
the
pacific
and
two
thousand
miles
of
virgin
forest
from
the
atlantic
a
door
communicating
with
the
outside
world
he
said
for
he
was
an
enthusiast
that
bolivia
is
the
richest
country
in
the
world
the
mines
of
potosi
are
in
bolivia
its
mountains
rise
from
fertile
tropical
plains
to
arctic
altitudes
the
rubber
tree
grows
below
and
a
climate
for
barley
is
found
in
a
few
days
journey
towards
the
sky
but
the
riches
of
bolivia
are
locked
up
small
parcels
of
precious
goods
may
be
got
out
over
the
andean
barrier
on
mule
back
or
they
may
dribble
in
a
thin
stream
down
the
beni
mamoré
and
madre
de
dios
which
unite
not
far
from
the
brazilian
boundary
to
form
the
rio
madeira
the
beni
is
a
very
great
and
deep
river
which
has
a
course
of
miles
before
it
contributes
its
volume
to
the
madeira
the
rio
madeira
a
broad
and
deep
stream
in
the
rainy
season
reaches
the
amazon
in
another
miles
but
between
and
san
antonio
the
madeira
comes
down
a
terrace
miles
in
length
of
nineteen
dangerous
cataracts
the
bolivian
rubber
collectors
shoot
those
rapids
in
their
batelaōes
large
vessels
carrying
sometimes
ten
tons
of
produce
and
a
crew
of
a
dozen
men
when
the
river
is
full
many
are
overturned
and
the
produce
and
the
men
are
lost
the
madeira
traverses
a
country
notorious
even
on
the
amazon
for
its
fever
and
quite
unexplored
a
mile
inland
anywhere
on
its
banks
the
rubber
hunters
too
have
to
reckon
with
wandering
tribes
of
hostile
indians
the
country
is
like
that
then
judge
its
value
for
a
railway
route
in
the
early
seventies
but
colonel
church
was
a
new
englander
and
again
he
was
a
visionary
so
therefore
most
energetic
and
compelling
he
soon
persuaded
the
practical
business
folk
who
seldom
know
much
and
are
at
the
mercy
of
every
eloquent
dreamer
to
part
with
a
lot
of
money
to
buy
his
bolivian
dream
we
do
really
find
the
colonel
on
november
solemnly
cutting
the
first
sod
of
a
railway
in
the
presence
of
a
party
of
indians
with
the
wild
about
him
which
had
persisted
from
the
beginning
of
things
what
the
indians
thought
of
it
is
not
recorded
anyhow
they
seem
to
have
humoured
the
infatuated
man
who
stopped
to
cut
a
square
of
grass
in
the
land
of
the
parentintins
the
men
who
go
stark
naked
and
make
musical
instruments
out
of
the
shin
bones
of
their
victims
an
english
company
of
engineering
contractors
was
given
the
job
of
building
the
line
and
a
small
schooner
the
silver
spray
went
up
to
san
antonio
with
materials
in
her
captain
and
some
of
her
officers
died
on
the
way
a
year
later
the
contractors
confessed
utter
defeat
the
jungle
had
won
they
declared
that
the
country
was
a
their
men
dying
like
flies
that
the
road
ran
through
an
inhospitable
wilderness
of
alternating
swamp
and
porphyry
ridges
and
that
with
the
command
of
all
the
capital
in
the
world
and
half
its
population
it
would
be
impossible
to
build
the
there
is
a
quality
of
bitterness
in
their
vehement
hate
which
i
recognise
i
heard
the
same
emotional
chord
expressed
concerning
that
land
though
not
because
of
failure
there
only
two
years
ago
but
the
bank
of
england
held
a
large
sum
in
trust
for
the
pursuance
of
this
enterprise
and
after
the
lawyers
had
attended
to
the
trust
money
in
long
debate
in
chancery
there
was
yet
enough
of
it
left
to
justify
the
indefatigable
colonel
in
beginning
the
railway
again
that
was
in
collins
of
philadelphia
obtained
the
contract
the
road
of
metre
gauge
was
to
be
built
in
three
years
the
matter
excited
the
united
states
into
a
wonderful
attention
the
press
there
went
slightly
delirious
and
the
excited
was
advised
that
two
philadelphians
are
to
overcome
the
madeira
rapids
and
to
open
up
to
the
world
a
land
as
fair
as
the
garden
of
the
the
little
steamer
mercedita
of
tons
with
engineers
and
material
was
despatched
to
san
antonio
on
january
her
departure
was
made
an
important
national
occasion
and
it
is
an
historic
fact
which
may
be
confirmed
by
a
reference
to
the
files
of
philadelphian
papers
of
that
date
that
strong
men
as
well
as
women
and
children
sobbed
aloud
on
the
departure
of
the
steamer
the
vessel
arrived
at
san
antonio
on
the
february
they
had
barely
started
operations
when
so
they
said
a
brazilian
official
told
them
betraying
some
feeling
when
the
english
came
here
they
did
nothing
but
smoke
and
drink
for
two
days
but
americans
work
like
the
yet
by
all
accounts
the
english
method
was
right
i
prefer
it
on
the
amazon
the
preface
to
work
there
should
be
extended
to
three
or
even
more
days
of
drinking
and
smoking
yet
it
must
be
said
that
if
ever
men
should
have
honour
for
holding
to
a
duty
when
it
was
far
more
easy
and
even
more
reasonable
to
leave
it
then
i
submit
the
claim
of
those
american
engineers
having
lived
in
the
place
where
many
of
them
died
and
knowing
their
story
i
feel
a
certain
kinship
there
is
no
monument
to
them
no
epic
has
been
written
of
their
tragedy
but
their
story
is
i
should
think
one
of
the
saddest
in
the
annals
of
commerce
of
the
who
left
for
san
antonio
at
different
times
lost
their
lives
mostly
of
disease
though
perished
in
the
wreck
of
a
transport
ship
that
is
far
higher
a
mortality
rate
than
that
of
say
the
south
african
or
the
american
civil
war
few
of
those
men
appeared
to
know
the
tropics
they
thought
the
tropics
meant
only
prodigal
largess
of
fruits
and
sun
and
a
wide
latitude
of
common
mistake
the
enterprise
became
a
lingering
disaster
their
state
was
already
bad
when
a
supply
ship
was
lost
and
they
hopefully
waited
ill
and
starving
but
with
a
gallant
mockery
of
their
lot
as
their
letters
and
diaries
attest
for
food
and
medicine
which
were
not
to
reach
them
the
doctors
continued
the
daily
round
of
the
host
of
the
giving
them
quinine
which
was
a
deceit
made
of
flour
the
wages
of
all
ceased
for
legal
reasons
and
they
were
in
a
place
where
little
is
cultivated
and
so
most
food
has
to
be
imported
in
spite
of
a
tariff
which
usually
doubles
the
price
of
every
necessary
of
life
some
of
the
survivors
despairing
and
heroic
souls
attempted
to
escape
on
rafts
down
the
river
they
might
as
well
have
tried
to
cut
their
way
through
the
thousand
miles
of
forest
between
them
and
manaos
the
railway
undertaking
collapsed
again
and
the
clearing
the
huts
and
the
workshops
and
the
short
line
that
was
actually
laid
were
left
for
the
vines
and
weeds
to
bury
but
now
again
the
conquering
forest
is
being
attacked
the
railway
has
been
recommenced
and
our
steamer
the
capella
is
taking
up
supplies
for
the
establishment
at
porto
velho
from
which
the
new
railway
begins
three
miles
this
side
of
san
antonio
iii
on
the
morning
of
the
january
while
we
were
still
considering
seeing
what
the
sun
was
like
and
the
languid
air
and
that
we
were
reduced
to
tinned
beans
fat
bacon
and
butter
which
was
oil
and
flies
whether
it
was
worth
while
to
note
our
breakfast
steward
stood
swinging
it
with
the
gravity
of
a
priest
under
the
break
of
the
shout
came
from
the
bridge
that
the
rio
madeira
was
in
view
as
far
back
as
swansea
we
had
heard
legends
of
this
stream
and
they
were
sufficiently
disturbing
when
we
arrived
at
para
we
heard
more
and
worse
the
pilot
we
engaged
there
called
the
madeira
the
long
at
serpa
for
the
first
time
we
saw
what
happened
to
frail
humanity
when
it
ventured
far
on
the
madeira
one
day
a
river
steamer
came
to
serpa
with
a
cargo
of
men
from
san
antonio
the
river
steamers
of
the
amazon
are
vessels
of
broad
beam
and
shallow
draft
painted
the
dingy
hue
of
the
river
itself
and
they
have
two
tiers
of
decks
shelves
between
the
supports
of
which
the
passengers
sling
their
hammocks
the
passengers
do
not
sleep
in
bunks
this
paddleboat
came
throbbing
towards
where
we
were
at
anchor
it
was
night
and
she
was
unseen
a
palpitation
in
the
dark
accompanied
somehow
by
a
fountain
of
sparks
such
boats
burn
wood
in
their
furnaces
when
her
noise
had
ceased
and
her
lights
imperceptibly
enlarged
as
the
current
dropped
her
down
abeam
of
us
a
breath
of
her
a
draught
of
air
passed
our
way
i
am
more
familiar
now
with
the
odour
malaria
causes
but
then
i
thought
she
must
have
a
freight
of
the
dead
she
anchored
we
could
see
her
loaded
hammocks
in
the
light
of
the
few
lamps
she
carried
through
the
binoculars
next
morning
i
inspected
with
peculiar
interest
the
row
of
cadaverous
heads
with
black
tousled
hair
skins
open
mouths
and
vacant
eyes
which
stared
at
us
over
her
rails
each
looked
as
though
once
it
had
peered
into
the
eyes
of
doom
and
then
was
but
waiting
caring
nothing
there
ahead
was
the
madeira
now
for
us
we
were
then
nearly
a
thousand
miles
from
the
sea
well
within
south
america
but
that
of
the
amazon
and
its
chief
tributary
was
an
expanse
of
water
surprising
in
its
immensity
as
much
light
was
reflected
from
the
floor
as
at
sea
the
water
was
oceanic
in
amplitude
the
forest
boundaries
were
so
far
away
that
one
could
not
realise
even
when
the
time
we
had
been
on
the
river
was
remembered
as
a
prolonged
monotony
that
this
was
the
centre
of
a
continent
the
forest
on
our
port
side
was
near
enough
for
us
to
see
its
limbs
and
its
vines
but
to
the
where
we
were
heading
for
bolivia
and
to
the
north
the
way
to
the
guianas
and
to
the
east
out
of
which
we
had
come
and
to
the
west
where
was
peru
the
land
was
but
a
low
violet
barrier
varying
in
altitude
with
distance
and
with
silver
sections
in
it
marking
the
river
roads
in
the
there
was
a
broad
silver
path
through
the
wall
the
way
to
the
rio
negro
manaos
and
the
orinoco
in
the
south
the
near
forest
being
flooded
was
a
puzzle
of
islands
as
we
progressed
they
opened
out
as
a
line
of
green
headlands
the
madeira
appeared
to
have
three
widely
separated
mouths
with
a
complexity
of
intermediate
and
connective
minor
ditches
indeed
the
gate
of
the
river
was
a
region
of
inundated
jungle
one
began
to
understand
why
travellers
here
sometimes
find
themselves
on
the
wrong
river
our
bows
turned
in
to
the
forest
wall
and
for
a
few
minutes
i
could
not
see
any
way
for
us
there
the
jungle
parted
and
we
were
on
a
narrow
turgid
flood
the
colour
of
the
main
river
but
swifter
a
majestic
forest
was
near
to
either
beam
we
were
enclosed
and
after
we
entered
the
madeira
my
dark
thoughts
of
our
future
at
once
left
me
if
they
returned
it
was
only
to
be
joked
about
in
the
dry
way
one
does
refer
to
a
dread
that
has
been
long
in
the
distance
and
then
one
day
takes
shape
becomes
material
and
settles
down
with
us
its
form
as
you
know
nearly
always
allays
your
alarms
your
simple
mind
has
expected
something
with
the
lowering
face
of
evil
lo
evil
has
even
bright
eyes
its
nature
its
dark
craft
which
you
have
dreaded
is
not
seen
and
your
mind
grows
light
with
surprise
what
only
this
then
i
never
saw
earth
look
more
resplendent
and
chromatic
than
on
the
day
when
we
entered
that
river
with
a
bad
name
presently
i
was
a
brief
resurgence
of
the
old
gloom
which
had
shrouded
my
conjectural
might
be
called
upon
to
pay
the
price
for
this
surprising
gift
of
intense
colour
light
and
luscious
heat
for
the
quickening
of
the
blood
as
though
the
tropic
air
were
a
stimulant
as
well
as
a
narcotic
well
it
does
seem
but
fair
if
chance
being
happy
gives
you
a
place
in
the
tropics
to
expect
to
have
less
time
there
than
is
given
for
the
job
of
eking
out
a
meagre
existence
in
the
north
it
would
not
be
right
to
look
for
gain
both
ways
you
will
have
noticed
already
i
suppose
that
i
have
not
been
on
the
madeira
fifteen
minutes
this
i
thought
as
i
walked
to
and
fro
on
the
capella
is
different
from
that
endurance
bitter
and
prolonged
in
the
land
where
there
is
no
sun
worth
mentioning
where
the
wind
blows
where
the
poor
rate
is
so
and
so
in
the
pound
and
you
are
one
of
the
fortunate
if
you
pay
it
and
lord
rosebery
lectures
on
thrift
i
mentioned
this
to
the
doctor
he
did
not
remove
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
because
the
idea
dawned
on
me
as
i
sank
into
a
deck
chair
beside
the
surgeon
under
the
poop
awning
and
borrowed
his
silver
because
as
to
thrift
and
parching
winds
abstinence
and
prudence
and
lectures
by
the
solemn
on
how
to
thin
out
your
life
in
cold
climates
where
all
that
is
worth
having
is
annexed
why
praise
a
man
who
is
willing
to
deprave
his
life
to
sand
and
frost
there
in
merry
england
the
poor
wretch
is
where
the
riches
of
earth
are
not
broadcast
largess
as
i
see
they
are
here
but
are
stacked
on
each
side
of
the
road
and
guarded
by
police
leaving
to
him
but
the
inclement
highway
with
nothing
but
lord
rosebery
s
advice
and
benediction
to
help
him
keep
the
wind
out
of
the
holes
in
his
trousers
that
benefit
and
the
bleak
consideration
that
he
may
swink
all
day
for
a
handful
of
beans
or
go
without
what
is
prudence
in
that
man
it
is
his
goodwill
for
the
police
to
be
blue
nosed
and
meek
at
heart
and
to
hoard
half
the
crust
of
your
stinted
bread
is
to
blaspheme
the
king
of
glory
some
men
will
touch
their
crowns
to
carnegie
in
heaven
thrift
and
abstinence
they
began
to
look
the
most
snivelling
of
sins
as
i
watched
with
spacious
leisure
the
near
procession
of
gigantic
trees
that
superb
wild
which
did
not
arise
from
such
niggard
and
flinty
maxims
frugality
and
prudence
that
is
to
regard
the
means
to
death
in
life
the
pallor
and
projecting
bones
of
a
warped
existence
as
good
men
dwell
on
courage
motherhood
rebellion
and
may
time
and
the
other
proofs
of
vitality
and
growth
now
i
thought
i
see
what
to
do
all
those
improving
lectures
reform
leagues
university
settlements
labour
exchanges
and
other
props
for
crippled
humanity
are
idle
it
is
a
generative
idea
that
is
wanted
a
revelation
a
vision
it
would
be
easier
and
quicker
to
take
regiments
of
folk
out
of
ancoats
hanley
bethnal
green
and
the
cottages
of
the
countryside
for
one
long
glance
at
the
kind
of
earth
i
see
now
the
world
would
expand
as
they
looked
they
would
get
the
dynamic
suggestion
in
vain
afterwards
would
the
monopolists
and
the
superior
persons
chant
patriotic
verse
to
drown
the
noise
of
chain
forging
at
the
westminster
foundry
not
the
least
good
that
the
folk
would
not
hear
their
minds
would
be
absent
and
outward
not
locked
within
to
huddle
with
cramped
and
respectful
thoughts
they
would
not
start
instinctively
at
the
word
of
command
they
would
begin
with
dignity
and
assurance
to
compass
their
own
affairs
and
in
an
enormous
way
and
they
would
make
hardly
a
sound
as
they
moved
forward
and
they
would
have
uplifted
and
shining
eyes
then
you
think
more
of
em
than
i
do
said
the
surgeon
it
would
be
no
use
i
saw
clearly
sending
the
folk
to
algeria
egypt
or
new
york
such
places
never
betray
to
the
traveller
that
our
world
is
not
a
shapeless
parcel
of
fields
and
buildings
tied
up
with
bylaws
and
sealed
by
the
grand
lama
as
his
last
act
in
the
stupendous
work
of
creation
there
it
is
an
angular
package
in
the
sky
which
the
sun
reads
and
directs
on
its
way
to
heaven
in
advance
of
its
limited
syndicate
of
proprietors
here
on
the
madeira
i
had
a
vision
instead
of
the
earth
as
a
great
and
shining
sphere
there
were
no
fences
and
private
bounds
i
saw
for
the
first
time
an
horizon
as
an
arc
suggesting
how
wide
is
our
ambit
that
bare
shoulder
of
the
world
effaced
regions
and
constellations
in
the
sky
our
earth
had
celestial
magnitude
it
was
warm
a
living
body
the
abundant
rain
was
vital
and
the
forest
i
saw
nobler
in
stature
and
with
an
aspect
of
intensity
beyond
what
the
amazon
forests
showed
rose
like
a
sign
of
life
triumphant
you
see
what
that
tropical
wilderness
did
for
me
and
with
but
a
single
glance
whatever
comes
after
i
shall
never
be
the
same
again
the
complacent
length
of
the
ship
was
before
us
amidships
were
some
of
the
fellows
staring
overside
absorbed
now
and
then
when
his
beat
brought
him
to
the
port
side
i
could
see
the
head
of
the
little
pilot
on
the
bridge
his
colleague
was
sleeping
in
one
of
the
hammocks
slung
between
the
stanchions
of
the
poop
awning
the
doctor
was
scrutinising
a
pair
of
motuca
flies
which
hovered
about
his
ankles
waiting
for
him
to
go
to
sleep
he
wanted
them
for
specimens
the
skipper
looking
a
little
anxious
came
slowly
up
the
poop
ladder
crossed
over
and
stood
by
our
chairs
the
river
is
full
of
big
timber
he
said
he
went
to
stare
overside
and
then
came
back
to
us
the
current
is
about
five
knots
and
those
trees
adrift
are
as
big
as
barges
i
hope
they
keep
clear
of
the
the
skipper
s
eye
was
uneasy
he
was
glum
with
suspicion
he
spoke
of
the
way
his
fools
might
meet
the
wiles
of
fortune
at
a
time
when
he
was
below
and
his
ship
was
without
its
acute
protective
intelligence
he
stood
a
spare
figure
in
white
in
a
limp
grass
hat
with
flapping
eaves
gazing
forward
to
the
bridge
mistrustfully
he
had
brought
us
in
a
valuable
vessel
to
a
place
unknown
and
now
he
had
to
go
on
and
afterwards
get
us
all
out
again
i
began
to
feel
a
large
respect
for
this
elderly
master
mariner
who
did
not
give
the
beard
of
an
onion
for
any
man
s
sympathy
who
had
skilfully
contrived
to
put
us
where
we
were
and
now
was
unaware
what
mischance
would
send
us
to
rot
under
the
forest
wall
the
bottom
to
fall
out
of
our
adventure
just
when
we
were
in
its
narrowest
passage
and
achievement
was
almost
within
view
this
is
no
place
for
a
ship
the
captain
mumbled
it
isn
t
right
we
re
disturbing
the
mud
all
the
time
and
look
at
those
butterflies
now
dodging
about
us
he
was
continuing
this
monologue
as
a
dirty
cap
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
ladder
and
a
long
and
ragged
length
of
sorrowful
sailor
mounted
there
and
doffed
the
cap
the
skipper
brusquely
signed
to
him
to
approach
he
was
a
youngster
in
an
advanced
stage
of
some
trouble
and
he
had
no
english
i
think
he
was
a
swede
he
demonstrated
his
sickness
baring
his
arm
muttering
unintelligibly
the
limb
like
his
hand
was
distorted
with
large
blisters
there
was
his
face
too
i
mistrusted
my
equanimity
for
some
moments
but
braced
my
eyes
compelling
them
to
be
scientific
and
impersonal
by
signs
we
gathered
he
had
been
sleeping
on
deck
such
was
the
heat
of
the
forecastle
and
the
mosquitoes
the
doctor
said
had
poisoned
a
body
already
tainted
from
the
stews
of
rotterdam
the
corroding
spirit
of
the
jungle
was
beginning
to
permeate
through
our
flaws
the
doctor
went
to
his
surgery
the
pilot
sat
up
in
his
hammock
glanced
indifferently
at
the
sick
sailor
yawning
and
stretching
his
arms
his
dainty
little
brown
feet
dangling
just
clear
of
the
deck
he
began
to
roll
a
cigarette
of
something
which
looked
like
tea
then
he
dropped
out
and
went
forward
to
release
his
mate
on
the
bridge
and
the
senior
pilot
came
up
as
the
doctor
had
finished
his
job
the
junior
pilot
a
fragile
girlish
fellow
rather
taciturn
greets
us
always
with
a
faintly
supercilious
smile
his
chief
is
a
round
jolly
little
man
hearty
and
lavish
with
ornamental
gestures
we
both
smiled
involuntarily
as
he
marched
across
to
us
with
his
uniform
cap
bearing
our
ship
s
badge
stuck
on
the
back
of
his
head
with
a
bias
to
the
right
ear
there
is
not
enough
of
portuguese
in
our
ship
s
company
to
serve
one
conversation
adequately
but
we
get
on
well
with
this
pilot
and
he
with
us
he
sits
in
a
hammock
making
pantomime
explanatory
of
brazil
to
us
strangers
and
we
pick
him
up
with
alacrity
after
but
brief
pauses
while
the
doctor
beguiled
him
into
dramatic
moments
i
lay
back
and
watched
him
searching
for
brazilian
characteristics
to
report
here
you
know
that
when
you
have
returned
from
a
far
country
you
are
asked
unanswerable
questions
about
its
people
and
especially
about
its
women
we
are
easily
flattered
by
the
suggestion
that
we
are
authoritative
with
opinions
got
from
uncommon
experience
especially
where
women
with
strange
eyes
and
dark
skins
are
concerned
so
once
upon
a
time
i
caught
rather
i
caught
that
cold
critical
and
impartial
part
of
me
which
is
a
solemn
answering
a
question
of
this
kind
explaining
in
a
comprehensive
way
the
character
of
the
brazilian
people
as
though
i
were
telling
of
the
objective
phenomena
of
one
simple
soul
presently
the
wise
and
ribald
part
of
me
woke
caught
the
note
of
that
inhuman
voice
and
raised
a
derisive
cry
heard
by
me
with
grave
deprecation
but
not
heard
at
all
by
my
listener
i
stopped
for
what
do
i
know
of
the
brazilian
character
very
little
is
there
such
a
thing
i
suppose
the
true
brazilian
is
like
the
true
englishman
or
the
typical
bird
which
is
known
by
its
bones
but
may
be
anything
from
a
crow
to
a
nightingale
but
is
more
likely
a
lark
you
can
imagine
the
foreigner
taking
his
knowledge
of
the
british
who
met
him
at
the
the
of
bernard
shaw
the
rev
jeremiah
hardshell
father
o
flynn
you
me
the
cabman
who
swore
at
him
his
landlady
and
her
daughter
piccadilly
by
night
and
tom
bowling
carefully
adjusting
all
that
valuable
british
data
just
as
professor
karl
pearson
does
his
physical
statistics
and
explaining
the
result
as
the
modern
english
adding
in
the
usual
footnote
what
decadent
tendencies
are
to
be
deduced
in
addition
from
the
facts
which
could
not
be
worked
into
the
major
premises
now
there
was
the
handsome
brazilian
customs
officer
tall
august
with
dark
eyes
haughty
and
slow
with
thought
the
waves
of
his
romantic
black
hair
faintly
traced
in
silver
who
might
have
been
a
poet
or
a
philosophic
revolutionist
but
who
was
the
man
as
the
first
mate
told
us
after
we
had
searched
everywhere
for
the
articles
who
pinched
your
bloomin
and
my
take
if
you
like
the
ladies
at
the
para
hotel
who
looked
at
us
with
sleepy
eyes
and
who
i
suspect
were
not
brazilians
at
all
supposing
they
were
there
must
be
counted
the
wife
of
the
official
at
serpa
she
came
aboard
there
with
her
husband
to
see
an
english
ship
she
reminded
me
of
that
picture
of
the
madonna
by
sassoferrato
in
the
national
gallery
i
am
unable
to
come
nearer
to
justice
to
her
than
that
again
there
was
a
certain
vain
native
apothecary
and
he
had
the
idea
that
i
was
to
the
capella
s
surgeon
much
to
that
fellow
s
secret
delight
the
chemist
treated
me
with
a
studied
difference
in
consequence
and
though
our
surgeon
could
have
undeceived
the
mistaken
man
having
some
portuguese
he
refused
to
do
so
i
remember
the
pilot
who
when
he
left
us
at
serpa
and
i
bade
him
farewell
did
before
all
our
ship
s
company
embrace
me
heartily
rest
his
cheek
against
mine
and
make
loving
noises
in
his
throat
and
there
is
our
present
chief
guide
now
swinging
in
his
hammock
and
looking
down
upon
us
waggishly
he
had
not
been
a
pilot
always
once
he
was
a
clown
in
a
circus
that
little
fact
is
a
clue
to
much
which
otherwise
would
have
been
obscure
in
him
when
he
boarded
us
at
serpa
to
take
the
place
of
the
man
who
shrank
from
the
thought
of
the
madeira
the
under
the
bridge
was
given
to
him
and
as
the
mate
put
it
he
moved
he
had
bundles
boxes
bags
baskets
a
tin
trunk
a
chair
a
parrot
a
hammock
and
some
pictures
he
was
going
to
be
with
us
for
two
months
but
his
affair
had
the
conclusive
character
of
a
migration
a
final
severance
from
his
old
life
his
friends
came
to
see
him
depart
and
they
wound
themselves
in
each
others
arms
head
laid
in
resignation
on
shoulders
looks
as
if
we
re
bound
for
the
golden
shore
commented
the
boatswain
this
little
rounded
man
the
pilot
with
his
unctuous
olive
skin
tiny
moustache
of
black
silk
and
impudent
eyes
looked
ripe
in
middle
age
though
actually
he
was
but
thirty
he
wore
a
suit
of
azure
cotton
ironed
faultlessly
and
his
tunic
fitted
with
hooks
and
eyes
across
his
throat
his
boots
were
sulphur
coloured
and
parisian
a
massive
gold
ring
which
carried
a
carbonado
nearly
as
large
as
the
stopper
of
a
beer
bottle
was
embedded
in
a
fat
finger
of
his
right
hand
in
the
front
of
his
cap
he
had
sewn
the
badge
of
our
line
and
he
was
curiously
proud
of
that
gaudy
symbol
he
would
wear
the
cap
on
one
ear
and
walk
up
and
down
in
display
with
a
lofty
smile
and
a
carriage
supposed
to
appertain
to
a
british
officer
in
a
grand
moment
he
had
a
great
admiration
for
all
that
was
british
except
our
food
if
you
were
up
at
sunrise
you
could
see
him
at
his
toilet
and
the
spectacle
was
worth
the
effort
his
array
of
toilet
vesicles
reminded
me
of
the
shelves
in
a
barber
s
shop
oiled
and
fragrant
he
took
his
seat
for
breakfast
with
much
formal
politeness
he
shook
our
saloon
company
into
a
sense
of
its
responsibilities
for
we
had
grown
indifferent
as
to
dress
and
sometimes
we
had
beards
his
handkerchiefs
and
linen
were
scented
and
dainty
with
floral
designs
and
he
took
wine
at
breakfast
and
after
idling
a
little
with
our
foreign
dishes
he
would
wipe
his
mouth
on
our
tablecloth
and
then
leave
for
the
bridge
as
he
passed
across
the
poop
we
would
hear
him
hawk
violently
and
spit
on
the
deck
then
the
skipper
would
glare
and
drive
his
chair
backwards
in
a
dark
passion
gazing
at
the
foliage
as
it
unfolded
our
pilot
named
the
paranas
tributaries
and
islands
when
they
drew
abeam
he
told
us
what
the
trees
were
and
then
with
head
shakes
and
uplifted
hands
and
eyes
indicated
what
grave
things
were
behind
that
screen
of
leaves
though
i
don
t
suppose
he
knew
his
mimicry
was
so
spontaneous
and
exact
that
it
was
more
entertaining
and
just
as
instructive
as
speech
he
taught
us
how
the
indians
kill
you
and
what
some
villagers
did
to
a
naughty
padre
and
how
the
sucuruju
swallows
a
deer
and
how
to
make
love
to
a
brazilian
girl
he
kicked
the
slippers
from
his
little
feet
and
smuggled
into
the
hammock
mesh
for
a
snooze
waving
a
hand
coyly
to
us
over
the
edge
of
his
nest
the
dinner
bell
rang
because
the
saloon
is
now
hot
beyond
endurance
the
steward
has
fixed
a
table
on
deck
and
so
as
we
eat
we
can
see
the
jungle
pass
that
keeps
some
of
our
mind
from
dwelling
over
much
on
the
dreary
menu
the
potatoes
have
begun
to
ferment
the
meat
is
out
of
tins
sometimes
it
is
served
as
fritters
sometimes
we
recognise
it
in
a
hash
and
sometimes
shameless
it
appears
without
dress
a
naked
and
shiny
lump
straight
from
its
metal
bed
often
the
bread
is
sour
the
butter
too
is
out
of
tins
feeding
is
not
a
joy
but
a
duty
but
it
is
soon
over
although
everybody
now
complains
of
indigestion
we
have
far
to
go
yet
and
the
cheerfulness
which
faces
all
circumstances
brazenly
must
be
our
manna
our
table
some
deal
planks
on
trestles
is
mellowed
by
a
white
tablecloth
we
sit
round
on
boxes
over
head
the
sun
flames
on
the
awning
making
it
golden
and
translucent
i
let
the
soup
pass
the
next
dish
is
a
hot
pot
of
tinned
mutton
and
preserved
vegetables
something
must
be
done
and
i
do
it
then
there
is
some
pickled
beef
and
pickled
onions
i
watch
the
forest
pass
then
for
desert
the
steward
the
hot
beads
touring
about
the
mounts
of
his
large
pale
face
brings
along
oleaginous
fritters
of
plum
duff
the
doctor
leaves
i
follow
him
to
the
chairs
again
and
we
exchange
and
fill
our
pipes
this
may
seem
to
you
unendurable
for
long
i
did
not
think
so
though
of
habits
so
regular
and
engrained
that
my
chances
of
survival
when
viewed
comparatively
for
my
ship
mates
were
hardened
and
usually
were
more
robust
seemed
poor
enough
but
i
enjoyed
it
there
was
nourishment
a
tonic
stay
in
our
desire
to
greet
every
onset
of
the
miseries
which
now
were
camped
about
us
besieging
our
souls
with
sansculotte
insolence
we
called
to
the
eumenides
with
mockery
like
thoreau
i
believe
i
could
live
on
a
tenpenny
nail
if
it
comes
to
that
there
is
no
doubt
the
forest
influences
our
moods
in
a
way
you
at
home
could
not
understand
our
minds
take
its
light
and
shade
and
just
as
our
little
company
gathered
in
the
chief
s
room
at
a
time
when
the
seas
were
running
high
recalled
sombre
legends
which
told
of
foredoom
so
this
forest
an
intrusive
presence
which
is
with
us
morning
noon
and
night
voiceless
or
making
such
sounds
as
we
know
are
not
for
our
ears
now
shadows
us
the
prescience
of
destiny
as
though
an
eyeless
mask
sat
at
table
with
us
a
being
which
could
tell
us
what
we
would
know
but
though
it
stays
makes
no
sign
this
forest
since
we
entered
the
para
river
now
a
thousand
miles
away
has
not
ceased
there
have
been
the
clearings
of
the
settlements
from
para
inwards
but
as
spruce
says
in
his
journal
those
clearings
and
campos
alter
the
forest
of
the
amazon
no
more
than
would
the
culling
of
a
few
weeds
alter
the
aspect
of
an
english
cornfield
the
few
openings
i
have
seen
in
the
forest
do
not
derange
my
clear
consciousness
of
a
limitless
ocean
of
leaves
its
deep
billows
of
foliage
rolling
down
to
the
only
paths
there
are
in
this
country
the
rivers
and
there
overhanging
arrested
in
collapse
there
is
no
land
one
must
travel
by
boat
from
one
settlement
to
another
the
settlements
are
but
islands
narrow
widely
sundered
by
vast
gulfs
of
jungle
the
forest
of
the
amazons
is
not
merely
trees
and
shrubs
it
is
not
land
it
is
another
element
its
inhabitants
are
arborean
they
have
been
fashioned
for
life
in
that
medium
as
fishes
to
the
sea
and
birds
to
the
air
its
green
apparition
is
persistent
as
the
sky
is
and
the
ocean
in
months
of
travel
it
is
the
horizon
which
the
traveller
can
not
reach
and
its
unchanging
surface
merged
through
distance
into
a
mere
reflector
of
the
day
a
brightness
or
a
gloom
in
his
immediate
vicinity
breaks
into
a
complexity
of
green
surges
then
one
day
the
voyager
sees
land
at
last
and
is
released
from
it
but
we
have
not
seen
land
since
serpa
there
are
men
whose
lives
are
spent
in
the
chasms
of
light
where
the
rivers
are
sunk
in
the
dominant
element
but
who
never
venture
within
its
green
surface
just
as
one
would
not
go
beneath
the
waves
to
walk
in
the
twilight
of
the
sea
bottom
now
i
have
been
watching
it
for
so
long
i
see
the
outer
aspect
of
the
jungles
does
vary
when
i
saw
it
first
on
the
para
river
it
appeared
to
my
wondering
eyes
but
featureless
green
cliffs
then
in
the
narrows
beyond
para
i
remember
an
impression
of
elegance
and
placidity
for
there
the
waters
still
being
tidal
and
saline
the
palms
were
conspicuous
and
in
profuse
abundance
the
great
palms
are
the
chief
feature
of
that
forest
elevation
with
their
graceful
columns
and
their
generous
and
symmetrical
fronds
which
sometimes
are
like
gigantic
green
feathers
and
again
are
like
fans
a
tall
palm
whatever
its
species
being
a
definite
expression
of
an
agglomeration
of
leaves
but
body
and
crown
a
real
forest
of
the
narrows
populous
with
such
exquisite
beings
had
marges
of
straight
ascending
lines
and
flourishing
and
geometrical
crests
beyond
the
river
xingu
on
the
main
stream
the
forest
persistent
as
a
presence
again
changed
its
aspect
it
was
ragged
and
shapeless
an
impenetrable
tangle
its
front
strewn
with
fallen
trees
the
vision
of
outer
desolation
by
obydos
it
was
more
aerial
and
shapely
again
but
not
of
that
light
and
soaring
grace
of
the
narrows
it
was
contained
yet
mounted
not
in
straight
lines
as
in
the
country
of
the
palms
but
in
convex
masses
here
on
the
lower
madeira
the
forest
seems
of
a
nature
intermediate
between
the
rolling
structure
of
the
growth
by
obydos
and
the
grace
of
the
palm
groves
in
the
estuarine
region
of
the
narrows
it
is
barbaric
and
splendid
easily
prodigal
with
illimitable
riches
sinking
the
river
beneath
a
wealth
of
forms
on
the
madeira
as
elsewhere
in
the
world
of
the
amazons
some
of
the
forest
is
on
as
that
land
is
called
which
is
not
flooded
when
the
waters
rise
there
the
trees
reach
their
greatest
altitude
and
diameter
it
is
the
region
of
the
caáapoam
the
great
woods
of
the
indians
a
stretch
of
shows
as
a
low
vertical
bank
of
clay
a
narrow
ribbon
of
yellow
earth
dividing
the
water
from
the
jungle
more
rarely
the
river
cuts
a
section
through
some
undulating
heights
of
red
i
call
these
cliffs
as
heights
they
are
in
this
flat
country
though
at
home
they
would
attract
no
more
attention
than
would
the
side
of
a
again
the
bank
may
be
of
that
cherry
and
saffron
clay
which
gives
a
name
to
itacoatiara
on
such
land
the
forest
of
the
madeira
is
immense
three
or
four
species
among
the
greater
trees
lording
it
in
the
green
tumult
expansively
always
conspicuous
where
they
stand
their
huge
boles
showing
in
the
verdant
façade
of
the
jungle
as
grey
and
brown
pilasters
their
crowns
rising
above
the
level
roof
of
the
forest
in
definite
cupolas
there
is
one
having
a
neat
and
compact
dome
and
a
grey
smooth
and
rounded
trunk
and
dense
foliage
as
dark
as
that
of
the
holm
oak
and
another
resembling
it
but
with
a
flattened
and
somewhat
disrupted
dome
i
guessed
these
two
giants
to
be
another
which
i
supposed
to
be
of
the
leguminous
order
had
a
silvery
bole
and
a
texture
of
pale
green
leafage
open
and
light
which
at
a
distance
resembled
that
of
the
birch
these
three
trees
when
assembled
and
well
grown
made
most
stately
riverside
groups
the
trunks
were
smooth
and
bare
till
somewhere
near
ninety
feet
from
the
ground
palms
were
intermediate
filling
the
spaces
between
them
but
the
palms
stood
under
the
exogens
growing
in
alcoves
of
the
mass
rising
no
higher
than
the
beginning
of
the
branches
and
foliage
of
their
lords
the
whole
overhanging
superstructure
of
the
a
window
an
inlet
anywhere
rolling
clouds
of
leaves
from
the
lower
rims
of
which
vines
were
catenary
looping
from
one
green
cloud
to
another
or
pendent
like
the
sundered
cordage
of
a
ship
s
rigging
two
other
trees
were
frequent
the
pao
mulatto
with
limbs
so
dark
as
to
look
black
and
the
castanheiro
the
brazil
nut
tree
the
roof
of
the
woods
lowered
when
we
were
steaming
past
the
igapo
the
igapo
or
aqueous
jungle
through
which
the
waters
go
deeply
for
some
months
of
the
year
is
of
a
different
character
and
perhaps
of
a
lesser
seems
less
but
then
it
grows
on
lower
ground
i
was
told
to
note
that
its
foliage
is
of
a
lighter
green
but
i
can
not
say
i
saw
that
it
is
in
the
igapo
that
the
hevea
braziliensis
flourishes
its
pale
bole
suggestive
of
the
white
poplar
deep
in
water
for
much
of
the
year
and
its
crown
sheltered
by
its
greater
neighbours
so
that
it
grows
in
a
still
heated
and
humid
twilight
this
low
ground
is
always
marked
by
growths
of
small
cecropia
trees
these
with
their
white
stems
their
habit
of
free
and
regular
branching
and
their
long
leaves
digital
in
the
manner
of
the
have
the
appearance
of
great
candelabra
sometimes
the
igapo
is
prefaced
by
an
area
of
cane
the
numberless
islands
being
of
recent
formation
have
a
forest
of
a
different
nature
and
they
seldom
carry
the
larger
trees
the
upper
ends
of
many
of
the
islands
terminate
in
sandy
pits
where
dwarf
willows
grow
so
foreign
was
the
rest
of
the
vegetation
that
notwithstanding
its
volume
and
intricacy
i
detected
those
humble
little
willows
at
once
as
one
would
start
surprised
at
an
english
word
heard
in
the
meaningless
uproar
of
an
alien
multitude
the
forest
absorbed
us
as
one
s
attention
would
be
challenged
and
drawn
by
the
casual
regard
never
noticeably
direct
but
never
withdrawn
of
a
being
superior
and
mysterious
so
i
was
drawn
to
watch
the
still
and
intent
stature
of
the
jungle
waiting
for
it
to
become
vocal
for
some
relaxing
of
its
static
form
nothing
ever
happened
i
never
discovered
it
rigid
watchful
enigmatic
its
presence
was
constant
but
without
so
much
as
one
blossom
in
all
its
green
vacuity
to
show
the
least
friendly
familiarity
to
one
who
had
found
flowers
and
woodlands
kind
it
had
nothing
that
i
knew
it
remained
securely
aloof
and
indifferent
till
i
thought
hostility
was
implied
as
the
sea
implies
its
impartial
hostility
in
a
constant
presence
which
experience
could
not
fathom
nor
interest
soften
nor
courage
intimidate
we
sank
gradually
deeper
inwards
towards
its
central
fastnesses
by
noon
on
our
first
day
on
the
madeira
we
reached
the
village
of
rozarinho
which
is
on
the
left
bank
with
the
tributary
of
the
same
name
a
little
more
up
stream
but
entering
from
the
other
side
here
as
we
followed
a
loop
of
the
stream
the
madeira
seemed
circumscribed
a
tranquil
lake
the
yellow
water
though
swift
had
so
polished
a
surface
that
the
reflections
of
the
forest
were
hardly
disturbed
sinking
below
the
tops
of
the
inverted
trees
to
the
ultimate
clouds
giving
an
illusion
of
profundity
to
the
apparent
lake
the
village
was
but
a
handful
of
leaf
huts
grouped
about
the
nucleus
of
one
or
two
larger
buildings
with
white
walls
there
was
the
usual
jetty
of
a
few
planks
to
which
some
canoes
were
tied
the
forest
was
a
high
background
to
those
diminished
huts
the
latter
as
we
came
upon
them
suddenly
increased
the
height
of
the
trees
in
another
place
the
shelter
of
a
family
of
indians
was
at
the
top
of
a
bank
secretive
within
the
base
of
the
woods
a
row
of
chocolate
babies
stood
outside
that
nest
with
four
jabiru
storks
among
them
each
bird
so
much
taller
than
the
babies
stood
resting
meditatively
on
one
leg
as
though
waiting
the
order
to
take
up
an
infant
and
deliver
it
somewhere
none
of
them
storks
or
infants
took
the
least
notice
of
us
perhaps
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
them
to
be
aware
of
mundane
things
certainly
i
had
a
feeling
myself
so
strange
was
the
place
and
quiet
and
tranquil
the
day
that
we
had
passed
world
s
end
and
that
what
we
saw
beyond
our
steamer
was
the
coloured
stuff
of
dreams
which
if
a
wind
blew
would
wreathe
and
clear
vanish
and
leave
a
shining
void
the
sunset
deepened
this
apprehension
there
came
a
wonderful
sky
of
orange
and
mauve
it
was
over
us
and
came
down
and
under
the
ship
we
moved
with
glowing
clouds
beneath
our
keel
there
was
no
river
the
forest
girdled
the
radiant
interior
of
a
hollow
sphere
the
pilots
could
not
proceed
at
night
shortly
after
sundown
we
anchored
in
nine
fathoms
the
trees
were
not
many
yards
from
the
steamer
when
the
ship
was
at
rest
a
canoe
with
two
indians
came
alongside
with
a
basket
of
guavas
they
were
shy
fellows
and
each
carried
in
his
hand
a
bright
machete
for
they
did
not
seem
quite
sure
of
our
company
after
tea
we
sat
about
the
poop
trying
to
smoke
and
in
the
case
of
the
doctor
and
the
purser
wearing
at
the
same
time
veils
of
butterfly
nets
as
protection
from
the
mosquito
swarms
the
netting
was
put
over
the
helmet
and
tucked
into
the
neck
of
the
tunic
yet
when
i
poked
the
stem
of
the
pipe
which
carried
the
gauze
with
it
into
my
mouth
the
veil
was
drawn
tight
on
the
face
a
mosquito
jumped
to
the
opportunity
and
arrived
alongside
the
frogs
were
making
the
deafening
clangour
of
an
iron
foundry
and
through
that
sound
shrilled
the
cicadas
i
listened
for
the
first
time
to
the
din
of
a
tropical
night
in
the
forest
there
is
no
word
strong
enough
to
convey
this
uproar
to
ears
which
have
not
listened
to
it
a
bright
still
sunrise
promising
heat
and
before
breakfast
the
ship
s
ironwork
was
too
hot
to
touch
the
novelty
of
this
madeira
is
already
beginning
to
merge
into
the
yellow
of
the
river
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
green
of
the
jungle
with
but
the
occasional
variation
of
low
roseous
cliffs
the
average
width
of
the
river
may
be
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
it
is
loaded
with
floating
timber
launched
upon
it
by
landslides
caused
by
the
rains
which
carry
away
sections
of
the
forest
each
large
enough
to
furnish
an
english
park
with
trees
sometimes
we
see
a
bight
in
the
bank
where
such
a
collapse
has
only
recently
occurred
the
wreckage
of
trees
being
still
fresh
many
of
the
trees
which
charge
down
on
the
current
are
of
great
bulk
with
half
their
base
high
out
of
the
water
occasionally
rafts
of
them
appear
locked
with
creepers
and
bearing
flourishing
gardens
of
weeds
this
characteristic
gives
the
river
its
portuguese
name
river
of
the
indians
know
the
madeira
as
the
cayary
white
its
course
serpentines
so
freely
that
at
times
we
steer
almost
east
and
then
again
go
west
our
general
direction
is
at
eight
this
morning
after
some
anxious
moments
when
the
river
was
dangerous
with
reefs
we
passed
the
village
of
borba
miles
from
serpa
here
there
is
a
considerable
clearing
with
kine
browsing
over
a
hummocky
sward
that
is
well
above
the
river
on
an
occurrence
of
the
red
clay
this
release
of
the
eyes
was
a
smooth
and
grateful
experience
after
the
enclosing
walls
some
steps
dug
in
the
face
of
the
low
cliff
led
to
the
white
houses
all
roofed
with
red
tiles
the
village
faced
the
river
from
each
house
ascended
the
leisurely
smoke
of
early
morning
the
church
was
in
the
midst
of
the
houses
its
bell
conspicuous
with
verdigris
two
men
stood
to
watch
us
pass
it
was
a
pleasant
assurance
to
have
those
roofs
and
the
steeple
rising
actually
into
the
light
of
the
sky
the
dominant
forest
in
which
we
were
sunk
was
here
definitely
put
down
by
our
we
were
beyond
borba
and
its
parana
and
island
just
above
it
before
the
pilot
had
finished
telling
us
where
we
watched
from
the
capella
s
bridge
that
borba
was
a
settlement
which
had
suffered
much
from
attacks
of
the
araras
indians
the
river
took
a
sharp
turn
to
the
east
and
again
went
west
islands
were
numerous
these
islands
are
and
lie
along
the
banks
separated
by
side
channels
their
paranas
from
the
land
the
smaller
river
craft
often
take
a
parana
instead
of
the
main
stream
to
avoid
the
rush
of
the
current
the
whole
region
seems
lifeless
there
is
never
a
flower
to
be
seen
and
rarely
a
bird
sometimes
though
we
disturb
the
snowy
heron
on
one
sandy
island
passed
during
the
afternoon
and
called
appropriately
ilho
do
jacaré
we
saw
two
alligators
otherwise
we
have
the
silent
river
to
ourselves
though
i
am
forgetting
the
butterflies
and
the
constant
arrival
aboard
of
new
winged
shapes
which
are
sometimes
so
large
and
grotesque
that
one
is
uncertain
about
their
aggressive
qualities
as
we
idle
on
the
poop
we
keep
by
us
two
insect
nets
and
a
the
doctor
is
making
a
collection
and
i
am
supposed
to
assist
when
i
came
on
deck
on
the
morning
of
our
arrival
in
the
brazils
it
was
not
the
orange
sunrise
behind
a
forest
which
was
topped
by
a
black
design
of
palm
fronds
nor
the
warm
odour
of
the
place
nor
the
height
and
intensity
of
the
vegetation
which
was
most
remarkable
to
me
a
from
the
restricted
north
it
was
a
butterfly
which
flickered
across
our
steamer
like
a
coloured
flame
no
other
experience
put
england
so
remote
a
superb
butterfly
too
bright
and
quick
to
be
anything
but
an
escape
from
paradise
will
stay
its
dancing
flight
as
though
with
intelligent
surprise
at
our
presence
hover
as
if
puzzled
and
swoop
to
inspect
us
alighting
on
some
such
incongruous
piece
of
our
furniture
as
a
coil
of
rope
or
the
cook
s
refuse
pail
pulsing
its
wings
there
plainly
nothing
to
do
with
us
the
prismatic
image
of
joy
out
always
rush
some
of
our
men
at
it
as
though
the
sight
of
it
had
maddened
them
as
would
a
revelation
of
accessible
riches
it
moves
only
at
the
last
moment
abruptly
and
insolently
they
are
left
to
gape
at
its
mocking
retreat
it
goes
in
erratic
flashes
to
the
wall
of
trees
and
then
soars
over
the
parapet
hope
at
large
then
there
are
the
other
things
which
so
far
as
most
of
us
know
have
no
names
though
a
sailor
wringing
his
hands
in
anguish
is
usually
ready
with
a
name
we
had
such
a
visitor
he
looked
a
fellow
the
doctor
might
require
so
i
marked
him
down
when
he
settled
near
a
hatch
on
the
afterdeck
he
was
a
bee
the
size
of
a
walnut
and
habited
in
dark
blue
velvet
in
this
land
it
is
wise
to
assume
that
everything
bites
or
stings
and
that
when
a
creature
looks
dead
it
is
only
carefully
watching
you
i
clapped
the
net
over
that
fellow
and
instantly
he
appeared
most
dead
knowing
he
was
but
shamming
and
that
he
would
give
me
no
assistance
i
stood
wondering
what
i
could
do
next
then
the
cook
came
along
the
cook
saw
the
situation
laughed
at
my
timidity
with
tropical
forms
went
down
on
his
knees
and
caught
my
prisoner
the
cook
raised
a
piercing
cry
on
the
bridge
i
saw
them
levelling
their
glasses
at
us
and
some
engineers
came
to
their
cabin
doors
to
see
us
where
we
stood
on
the
lonely
deck
the
cook
and
the
purser
in
a
tableau
of
poignant
tragedy
the
cook
walked
round
and
round
nursing
his
suffering
member
and
i
did
not
catch
all
he
said
for
i
know
very
little
dutch
but
the
spirit
of
it
was
familiar
and
his
thumb
was
bleeding
badly
the
bee
had
resumed
death
again
the
state
of
the
cook
s
thumb
was
a
surprise
till
the
surgeon
exhibited
the
bee
s
weapons
when
it
became
clear
that
thumbs
especially
when
dutch
and
rosy
like
our
cook
s
afforded
the
right
medium
for
an
artist
who
worked
with
such
mandibles
and
a
tail
that
was
a
stiletto
in
england
the
forms
of
insect
life
soon
become
familiar
there
is
the
housefly
the
lesser
cabbage
white
butterfly
and
one
or
two
other
little
things
in
the
brazils
though
the
great
host
of
forms
is
surprising
enough
it
is
the
variety
in
that
host
which
is
more
surprising
still
any
bright
day
on
the
capella
you
may
walk
the
length
of
the
ship
carrying
a
net
and
a
and
fill
the
bottle
butterflies
cockroaches
and
bugs
not
admitted
and
perhaps
have
not
three
of
a
species
the
men
frequently
bring
us
something
buzzing
in
a
hat
though
accidents
do
happen
to
where
the
doctor
is
sitting
and
the
specimen
is
mangled
in
a
frenzy
a
hornet
came
to
us
that
way
he
was
in
violet
armour
as
hard
as
a
crab
was
still
stabbing
the
air
with
his
long
needle
and
working
on
a
fragment
of
hat
he
held
in
his
jaws
but
such
knights
in
mail
are
really
harmless
for
after
all
they
need
not
be
interfered
with
it
is
the
insignificant
little
fellows
whose
object
in
life
it
is
to
interfere
with
us
which
really
make
the
difference
so
far
on
the
river
we
have
not
met
the
famous
pium
fly
but
the
motuca
fly
is
a
nuisance
during
the
afternoon
sleep
it
is
nearly
of
the
size
and
appearance
of
a
fly
but
its
wings
having
black
tips
look
as
though
their
ends
were
cut
off
the
motucas
while
we
slept
would
alight
on
the
wrists
and
ankles
and
where
each
had
fed
there
would
be
a
wound
from
which
the
blood
steadily
trickled
the
mosquitoes
do
not
trouble
us
till
sundown
but
one
morning
in
my
cabin
i
was
interested
in
the
hovering
of
what
i
thought
was
a
small
leggy
spider
which
because
of
its
colouration
of
black
and
grey
bands
was
evasive
to
the
sight
as
it
drifted
about
on
its
invisible
thread
at
last
i
caught
it
and
found
it
was
a
new
mosquito
in
pursuing
it
i
found
a
number
of
them
in
the
cabin
when
i
exhibited
the
insect
to
the
surgeon
he
did
not
well
disguise
his
concern
say
nothing
about
it
he
said
but
this
is
the
brute
so
our
interest
in
our
new
life
is
kept
alert
and
bright
the
solid
teak
doors
of
our
cabins
are
now
permanently
fixed
back
shutting
them
would
mean
suffocation
but
as
the
cabins
must
be
closed
before
sundown
to
keep
out
the
clouds
of
gnats
the
carpenter
has
made
wooden
frames
covered
with
copper
gauze
to
fit
the
door
openings
at
night
and
rounds
of
gauze
to
cap
the
open
ports
and
with
a
damp
cloth
and
some
careful
hunting
each
morning
one
is
able
to
keep
down
the
mosquitoes
which
have
managed
to
find
entry
during
the
night
and
have
retired
at
sunrise
to
rest
in
dark
corners
for
our
care
notwithstanding
the
insects
do
find
their
way
in
to
assault
our
lighted
lamps
the
chief
partly
because
as
an
old
sailor
he
is
a
fatalist
and
partly
because
he
thinks
his
massive
body
must
be
invulnerable
and
partly
because
he
has
a
contempt
anyway
for
protecting
himself
each
morning
has
a
new
collection
of
curios
alive
and
dead
littered
about
his
room
i
do
not
wonder
bates
remained
in
this
land
so
long
it
is
elysium
for
the
entomologist
one
of
the
live
creatures
found
in
his
room
the
chief
retains
and
cherishes
and
hopes
to
tame
though
the
object
does
not
yet
answer
to
his
name
of
edwin
this
creature
is
a
green
mantis
or
praying
insect
about
four
inches
long
which
the
chief
came
upon
where
it
rested
on
the
copper
gauze
of
his
holding
a
fly
in
its
hands
and
eating
it
as
one
would
an
apple
this
mantis
is
an
entertaining
freak
and
can
easily
keep
an
audience
watching
it
for
an
hour
if
the
day
is
dull
edwin
in
colour
and
form
is
as
fresh
fragile
and
translucent
as
a
leaf
in
spring
he
has
a
long
thin
stalk
to
his
wings
as
it
is
quite
a
third
of
his
length
he
has
a
calm
human
face
with
a
pointed
chin
at
the
end
of
his
neck
he
turns
his
face
to
gaze
at
you
without
moving
his
body
just
as
a
man
looks
backwards
over
his
shoulder
this
uncanny
mimicry
makes
the
chief
shake
with
mirth
then
if
you
alarm
edwin
he
springs
round
to
face
you
frilling
his
wings
abroad
standing
up
and
sparring
with
his
long
arms
which
have
hooks
at
their
ends
at
other
times
he
will
remain
still
with
his
hands
clasped
up
before
his
face
as
though
in
earnest
devotion
for
a
trying
period
if
a
fly
alights
near
him
he
turns
his
face
that
way
and
regards
it
attentively
then
sluggishly
he
approaches
it
for
closer
scrutiny
having
satisfied
himself
it
is
a
good
fly
without
warning
his
arms
shoot
out
and
that
fly
is
hopelessly
caught
in
the
hooked
hands
he
eats
it
i
repeat
as
you
do
apples
and
the
authentic
mouthfuls
of
fly
can
be
seen
passing
down
his
glassy
neck
edwin
is
fragile
as
a
new
leaf
in
form
has
the
same
delicate
colour
and
has
fascinating
ways
but
somehow
he
gives
an
observer
the
uncomfortable
thought
that
the
means
to
existence
on
this
earth
though
intricately
and
wonderfully
devised
might
have
been
managed
differently
edwin
who
seems
but
a
pretty
fragment
of
vegetation
is
what
we
call
a
lie
his
very
existence
rests
on
the
fact
that
he
is
a
diabolical
lie
gossamers
in
the
rigging
led
the
captain
to
prophesy
a
storm
before
night
clouds
of
an
indigo
darkness
of
immense
bulk
and
motionless
reduced
the
sunset
to
mere
runnels
of
opaline
light
about
the
bases
of
dark
mountains
inverted
in
the
heavens
there
was
a
rapid
fall
of
temperature
but
no
rain
our
world
and
we
in
its
centre
on
the
capella
waited
for
the
storm
in
an
expectant
hush
night
fell
while
we
waited
the
smooth
river
again
deepened
into
the
nadir
of
the
last
of
day
and
the
forest
about
us
changed
to
material
ramparts
of
cobalt
the
pilot
made
preparations
to
anchor
the
engine
bell
rang
to
a
summons
of
familiar
urgency
but
with
a
new
and
alarming
note
when
heard
in
a
place
like
that
the
forest
made
no
response
a
little
later
the
bell
clanged
rapidly
again
and
the
pulse
of
our
steamer
slowed
ceased
we
could
hear
the
water
uncoiling
along
our
plates
the
forest
itself
approached
us
came
perilously
near
the
skipper
s
voice
cried
abruptly
let
go
and
at
once
the
virgin
silence
was
demolished
by
the
uproar
of
our
cable
the
capella
throbbed
violently
she
literally
undulated
in
the
drag
of
the
current
we
still
drifted
slowly
down
stream
the
second
anchor
was
dropped
and
held
us
the
silence
closed
in
on
us
instantly
far
in
the
forest
somewhere
while
we
were
whispering
to
each
other
in
the
quiet
a
tree
fell
with
a
deep
significant
boom
we
had
been
under
way
for
more
than
an
hour
when
my
eyes
opened
on
the
illuminated
panorama
of
leaves
and
boles
unfolding
past
the
door
of
my
cabin
the
cicadas
were
grinding
their
scissors
loudly
in
the
trees
alongside
i
spent
much
of
this
day
on
the
bridge
where
i
liked
to
be
watching
the
pilot
at
work
the
skipper
was
there
and
in
a
cantankerous
mood
the
pilot
wants
us
to
make
a
chart
of
the
river
he
has
given
the
captain
and
me
a
long
list
of
islands
paranas
tributaries
villages
and
sitios
every
map
and
reference
to
the
river
we
have
on
board
is
valueless
a
map
of
the
river
indicates
many
settlements
with
beautiful
names
and
at
each
point
when
we
arrive
nothing
but
the
forest
shows
how
the
cartographers
arrived
at
such
results
is
a
mystery
this
river
which
their
generous
imaginings
have
seen
as
a
tortuous
bough
of
the
amazon
laden
with
villages
which
they
indicate
on
their
maps
with
marks
like
little
round
fruits
is
almost
barren
every
day
we
pass
small
sitios
or
clearings
maybe
the
mean
such
places
as
those
yet
each
clearing
is
but
a
brief
security
a
raft
of
size
of
the
garden
of
an
english
in
an
ocean
of
deep
leaves
where
a
rubber
man
has
built
himself
a
timber
house
and
some
huts
for
his
serfs
it
will
have
a
jetty
and
a
huddle
of
canoes
and
usually
a
few
children
on
the
bank
watching
us
we
salute
that
place
with
our
syren
as
we
pass
and
sometimes
the
kiddies
spring
for
home
then
as
though
we
were
shooting
at
them
or
we
see
a
little
embowered
shack
with
a
pile
of
fuel
logs
beside
it
and
a
crude
where
the
river
boats
replenish
when
traversing
this
stream
during
the
season
for
rubber
our
pilots
have
much
to
say
of
these
stations
and
of
all
the
rubber
men
on
the
river
and
their
wealth
but
away
with
their
rubber
i
am
tired
of
it
and
will
keep
it
out
of
this
book
if
i
can
for
it
is
blasphemous
that
in
such
a
potentially
opulent
land
the
juice
of
one
of
its
wild
trees
should
be
dwelt
it
is
in
the
states
of
amazonas
and
though
it
were
the
sole
act
of
providence
the
brazilians
can
see
nothing
here
but
rubber
the
generative
qualities
of
this
land
through
fierce
sun
and
warm
rarely
a
day
passes
without
rain
whatever
the
land
of
constant
high
summer
with
a
free
fecundity
which
has
buried
the
earth
everywhere
under
a
wild
growth
nearly
two
hundred
feet
deep
is
insignificant
to
them
they
see
nothing
in
it
at
all
but
the
damnable
commodity
which
is
its
ruin
para
is
mainly
rubber
and
manaos
the
amazon
is
rubber
and
most
of
its
tributaries
the
madeira
particularly
is
rubber
the
whole
system
of
communication
which
covers
miles
of
navigable
waters
waters
nourishing
a
humus
which
literally
stirs
beneath
your
feet
with
the
movements
of
spores
and
seeds
that
system
would
collapse
but
for
the
rubber
the
passengers
on
the
river
boats
are
rubber
men
and
the
cargoes
are
rubber
all
the
talk
is
of
rubber
there
are
no
manufactures
no
agriculture
no
fisheries
and
no
in
a
region
which
could
feed
clothe
and
shelter
the
population
of
a
continent
there
was
a
book
by
a
brazilian
i
saw
at
para
recently
published
and
called
the
green
hell
inferno
verde
on
its
cover
was
the
picture
of
a
nude
indian
woman
symbolical
of
amazonas
and
from
wounds
in
her
body
her
blood
was
draining
into
the
little
tin
cups
which
the
rubber
collector
uses
against
the
incisions
on
the
rubber
tree
from
what
i
heard
of
the
subject
and
i
heard
much
that
picture
was
little
overdrawn
i
begin
to
think
the
usual
commercial
mind
is
the
most
dull
wasteful
and
ignorant
of
all
the
sad
wonders
in
the
pageant
of
humanity
it
is
only
on
the
capella
s
bridge
that
you
feel
the
stagnant
air
which
is
upset
by
the
steamer
s
progress
there
it
spills
over
us
heavy
with
the
scent
of
the
lairage
on
the
fore
deck
the
bridge
is
a
narrow
elevated
outlook
full
in
the
sun
s
eye
where
i
can
get
a
view
of
the
complete
ship
as
she
serpentines
in
her
narrow
way
on
the
port
side
of
it
the
skipper
has
a
seat
and
there
now
he
sits
all
day
gazing
moodily
ahead
the
dapper
little
pilot
stands
centrally
throwing
brief
commands
over
his
shoulder
into
the
open
window
of
the
wheelhouse
where
a
sailor
gravely
chewing
tobacco
his
hands
on
the
wheel
is
as
rapt
as
though
in
a
trance
i
think
the
pilot
finds
his
way
by
divination
the
depth
of
the
river
is
most
variable
in
the
dry
season
i
hear
the
stream
becomes
but
a
chain
of
pools
connected
by
threads
which
may
be
no
more
than
eighteen
inches
deep
the
rest
of
its
bed
being
dry
mud
by
sun
cracks
the
rains
in
far
bolivia
overflowing
the
swamps
there
during
some
months
of
the
year
increase
the
depth
of
the
madeira
by
feet
the
local
rainy
season
would
make
hardly
any
difference
to
it
the
river
is
fed
from
reservoirs
which
stretch
beneath
the
andes
there
is
rarely
anything
to
show
why
for
a
spell
the
pilot
should
take
us
straight
ahead
in
and
then
again
tack
to
and
fro
across
sometimes
brushing
the
foliage
with
our
shrouds
i
have
plucked
a
bunch
of
leaves
in
an
unexpected
swoop
and
the
big
timber
comes
down
afloat
to
meet
us
in
a
procession
there
are
the
propellor
blades
to
be
thought
of
i
see
now
and
then
the
swirls
which
betray
rocks
in
hiding
and
when
dodging
those
dangerous
places
the
screw
disturbs
the
mud
and
the
stinks
but
the
pilot
takes
us
round
and
about
we
with
our
feet
of
length
and
feet
draught
as
a
man
would
steer
a
motor
car
to
aid
it
our
rudder
has
had
fixed
to
it
a
false
wooden
length
the
capella
is
a
very
good
girl
as
responsive
to
the
pilot
s
word
as
though
she
knew
that
he
alone
can
save
her
she
stems
this
powerful
current
at
but
four
knots
and
sometimes
we
come
to
places
where
if
she
hesitated
for
but
two
seconds
we
should
be
put
athwart
stream
to
close
the
channel
and
what
would
happen
to
us
with
nothing
but
unexplored
malarial
forest
each
side
of
us
is
not
useful
to
brood
on
occasionally
the
pilot
grasping
the
top
of
the
dodger
stares
beyond
us
fixedly
to
where
the
refracted
sunshine
is
blinding
between
the
green
cliffs
and
gives
quick
and
numerous
orders
to
the
wheelhouse
without
turning
his
head
the
skipper
gets
up
to
watch
the
capella
makes
surprising
swerves
the
pilot
nervously
taps
the
boards
with
his
foot
then
he
says
something
quietly
relaxes
and
comes
to
us
blithely
the
funny
dog
with
a
nonsense
story
and
the
skipper
sinks
couchant
again
once
more
i
watch
the
front
of
the
jungle
for
what
may
show
there
seldom
there
is
anything
new
which
shows
it
is
rare
even
when
close
alongside
that
one
can
trace
the
shape
of
a
leaf
there
are
but
the
conspicuous
grey
nests
of
the
ants
and
wasps
yet
several
times
i
saw
trees
in
blossom
domes
of
lilac
in
the
green
forest
roof
again
we
put
up
a
flight
of
hundreds
of
ducks
and
another
incident
was
a
blackwater
stream
the
rio
mataua
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
madeira
s
yellow
flood
and
its
dark
tributary
being
distinct
the
forest
is
lower
and
more
open
and
the
pao
mulatto
is
more
numerous
we
saw
the
important
village
of
manicoré
and
oncas
a
little
place
within
a
portico
of
the
woods
which
was
veiled
in
grey
smoke
for
they
were
coagulating
rubber
there
for
awhile
before
sunset
the
sky
was
scenic
with
great
clouds
and
glowing
with
the
usual
bright
colours
the
wilderness
was
transformed
each
evening
we
seem
to
anchor
in
a
region
different
in
nature
and
appearance
under
these
extraordinary
sunset
skies
from
the
country
we
have
been
travelling
since
daylight
transfiguration
at
eventime
we
know
in
england
yet
sunset
there
but
exalts
our
homeland
till
it
seems
more
intimately
ours
than
ever
as
though
then
came
a
luminous
revelation
of
its
rare
intrinsic
goodness
we
see
for
some
brief
moments
its
aura
but
this
tropical
jungle
at
dayfall
is
not
the
earth
we
know
it
is
a
celestial
vision
beyond
physical
attaining
beyond
knowledge
it
is
ulterior
glorious
transient
fading
before
our
surprise
and
wonder
fade
we
of
the
capella
are
its
only
witnesses
except
those
pale
ghosts
the
egrets
about
the
dim
aqueous
base
of
the
forest
darkness
comes
quickly
the
swoop
and
overspread
of
black
wings
the
stopping
of
the
ship
s
heart
because
the
pulsations
of
her
body
have
had
unconscious
response
in
yours
as
by
an
incorporeal
ligament
is
the
cessation
of
your
own
life
at
a
moment
there
is
a
strange
quiet
in
which
you
begin
to
hear
the
whisper
of
inanimate
things
a
log
glides
past
making
faint
labial
sounds
you
are
suddenly
released
from
prison
and
float
lightly
in
an
ether
impalpable
to
the
coarse
sounds
and
movements
of
earth
but
which
is
yet
sensitive
to
the
most
delicate
contact
of
your
thoughts
and
emotions
the
whispering
of
your
fellows
is
but
the
rustling
of
their
thoughts
in
an
illimitable
and
inviolate
silence
then
almost
imperceptibly
the
frogs
begin
their
nightlong
din
the
crickets
and
cicadas
join
between
the
varying
pitch
of
their
voices
come
other
nocturnes
in
monotones
from
creatures
unknown
to
complete
the
gamut
there
are
notes
so
profound
but
constant
that
they
are
a
mere
impression
of
obscurity
to
the
hearing
as
when
one
peers
listening
into
an
abysm
in
which
no
bottom
is
seen
and
others
are
stridulations
so
attenuated
that
they
shrill
beyond
reach
a
few
frogs
begin
it
there
are
ululations
wells
of
mellow
sound
bubbling
to
overflow
in
the
dark
and
they
multiply
and
unite
till
the
quality
of
the
sound
subdued
and
pleasant
at
first
is
quite
changed
it
becomes
monstrous
the
night
trembles
in
the
powerful
beat
of
a
rhythmic
clangour
one
can
not
think
of
frogs
hearing
that
metallic
din
at
one
time
soon
after
it
begins
the
chorus
seems
the
far
hubbub
mingled
and
levelled
by
distance
of
a
multitude
of
people
running
and
disputing
in
a
place
where
we
who
are
listening
know
that
no
people
are
the
noise
comes
nearer
and
louder
till
it
is
palpitating
around
us
it
might
be
the
life
of
the
forest
immobile
and
silent
all
day
now
released
and
beating
upwards
in
deafening
paroxysms
alongside
the
engine
room
casing
amidships
the
engineers
have
fixed
an
with
a
hurricane
lamp
in
its
midst
having
but
a
brief
halo
of
light
which
hardly
distinguishes
the
pickle
jar
from
the
marmalade
pot
a
haze
of
mosquitoes
quivers
round
the
light
the
air
is
hot
and
lazy
and
the
engineers
sit
about
limply
in
trousers
and
shirts
the
latter
open
and
showing
bosoms
as
various
as
faces
the
men
cheer
themselves
with
comical
plaints
about
the
heat
the
food
the
brazils
and
make
sudden
dabs
at
bare
flesh
when
the
insects
bite
them
the
chief
rallies
his
boys
as
would
a
cheery
though
is
nearly
his
own
age
but
still
much
of
a
lad
quietly
the
chief
heartily
insists
on
food
like
it
or
lump
it
i
go
forward
to
the
captain
s
tea
table
on
the
poop
deck
where
we
have
two
hurricane
lamps
and
where
the
figures
of
us
round
the
table
in
that
dismal
glim
are
the
thin
phantoms
of
men
the
lamps
have
been
lighted
only
that
moment
and
as
we
take
our
seats
the
insects
come
just
as
sharply
as
though
something
derisive
and
invisible
were
throwing
them
at
us
big
mole
crickets
bounce
into
our
plates
a
cicada
though
i
was
then
unaware
of
his
identity
a
monstrous
fly
which
looked
as
large
as
a
rat
and
with
a
head
like
a
lantern
alighted
before
me
on
the
cloth
and
remained
still
picking
it
up
tentatively
it
sprang
a
startling
police
rattle
between
my
finger
and
thumb
and
the
other
chaps
shouted
their
merriment
the
steward
places
a
cup
of
tea
before
each
of
us
and
in
an
interval
of
the
talk
the
skipper
announces
a
smell
of
paraffin
in
his
cup
we
experiment
with
ours
and
gravely
confirm
the
surgeon
bending
close
to
a
light
with
his
cup
the
deep
characteristics
of
his
face
strongly
seems
but
a
bodiless
head
in
the
he
detects
globules
of
fat
the
skipper
crudely
outlines
this
horror
to
the
steward
who
makes
an
inaudible
reply
in
german
and
disappears
down
the
companion
we
get
a
new
and
innocent
brew
there
is
hash
for
us
there
is
our
familiar
the
pickled
beef
there
are
saucers
of
brown
onions
there
are
saucers
of
jam
and
of
butter
the
steward
has
baked
some
cakes
and
their
grateful
smell
and
crisp
brown
rugged
surface
studded
with
plums
determine
in
my
mind
a
resolution
to
eat
four
of
them
if
i
can
get
them
without
open
shame
i
assert
that
our
skipper
has
a
counting
eye
for
the
special
dishes
though
you
may
eat
all
the
hash
you
want
damn
his
hash
the
bread
is
sour
i
want
cakes
after
tea
the
pilots
get
into
their
hammocks
and
under
their
curtains
out
of
the
way
of
the
mosquitoes
we
know
where
they
are
because
of
the
red
ends
of
their
cigarettes
we
sit
around
anywhere
the
skipper
the
chief
the
doctor
and
the
purser
there
is
little
to
be
said
we
talk
of
the
mosquitoes
in
ejaculations
for
the
little
wretches
quite
easily
penetrate
linen
and
can
manage
even
worsted
socks
occasionally
flying
insects
bump
into
the
tin
lamp
placed
above
us
on
the
ice
chest
no
there
is
no
ice
thin
divergent
arrows
of
light
the
fireflies
lace
the
gloom
and
the
trees
alongside
are
gemmed
with
them
we
find
still
less
to
say
to
each
other
but
fear
to
retire
to
our
heated
berths
for
as
it
is
just
possible
to
breathe
in
the
open
we
continue
to
defy
the
mosquitoes
the
first
mate
serenades
us
on
his
accordion
at
last
there
is
no
help
for
it
the
steward
comes
to
tell
the
master
that
his
cot
is
ready
the
old
man
sleeps
in
a
cot
draped
with
netting
and
slung
from
the
awning
beams
on
the
starboard
side
nightly
he
turns
in
there
and
unfailingly
a
rain
cloud
bursts
in
the
very
early
morning
pounding
on
the
awning
till
the
cool
spray
compels
him
and
he
retreats
in
his
pyjamas
for
shelter
taking
his
pillow
with
him
it
is
for
that
reason
i
do
not
use
the
cot
he
made
for
me
which
hangs
on
the
port
side
though
it
is
delightful
for
the
afternoon
nap
the
skipper
disappears
the
doctor
and
i
go
below
to
the
surgery
and
from
the
settee
there
he
removes
books
tobacco
tins
fishing
tackle
phials
india
rubber
tubing
and
small
leather
cases
making
room
for
us
both
and
first
we
have
some
out
of
his
bottle
and
then
we
try
some
out
of
mine
the
stuff
is
always
tepid
for
the
water
in
the
carafe
has
a
temperature
of
degrees
the
perspiration
begins
a
steady
permeation
as
we
talk
for
now
we
can
talk
and
talk
being
together
and
talking
is
better
than
sleep
which
at
its
best
is
but
a
fitful
doze
in
the
tropics
we
fall
as
it
were
on
each
other
s
necks
though
the
doctor
s
say
nothing
of
not
one
which
appears
to
invite
the
weak
tear
of
a
fellow
mortal
who
is
harassed
by
solitude
you
might
judge
it
too
cold
too
hard
and
unresponsive
a
support
for
that
and
i
have
seen
his
eye
even
repellent
he
is
not
elderly
but
he
is
grey
and
pallid
through
too
much
of
the
tropics
the
lines
descending
his
face
show
he
has
been
observing
things
for
long
and
does
not
think
much
of
them
when
disputing
with
him
he
does
not
always
reply
to
you
he
smiles
to
himself
a
habit
which
is
an
annoyance
to
some
people
whose
simple
minds
are
suspicious
and
who
are
unaware
that
the
surgeon
is
sometimes
forgetful
that
his
weaker
brethren
when
they
are
most
heated
and
disputative
with
him
then
most
lack
confidence
in
their
case
and
need
the
confirmation
of
the
wit
they
know
is
superior
that
is
no
time
when
one
should
look
at
the
wall
and
smile
quietly
the
capella
s
company
feel
that
the
surgeon
stands
where
he
overlooks
them
and
they
see
where
he
stands
unassumingly
superior
that
he
looks
upon
them
politely
they
do
not
know
he
is
really
sad
and
forgetful
they
think
he
is
amused
but
that
he
prefers
to
pretend
he
is
well
bred
i
must
confess
it
is
known
he
has
prescience
having
a
certain
devilish
quality
of
penetration
there
was
one
of
our
stokers
and
one
night
he
was
drunk
on
stolen
gin
and
latitudinous
and
so
attempted
a
curious
answer
to
the
second
engineer
who
sought
him
out
in
the
forecastle
concerning
work
now
the
second
engineer
is
a
young
man
who
has
a
number
of
photographs
of
himself
which
display
him
clad
but
in
vanity
and
shorts
back
front
and
profile
arms
folded
tightly
to
swell
his
very
large
muscles
he
has
really
a
model
figure
and
he
knows
it
the
cut
over
the
stoker
s
nose
was
a
bad
one
to
the
surgeon
the
stoker
went
early
next
morning
actually
for
a
hair
of
the
dog
but
with
a
story
that
he
was
then
to
go
on
duty
and
so
would
miss
his
ration
of
quinine
which
is
not
served
till
eleven
o
clock
the
quinine
as
you
know
is
given
in
gin
the
surgeon
complimented
the
man
on
such
proper
attention
to
his
health
and
willingly
gave
him
the
water
he
also
stood
at
the
door
of
the
alleyway
to
watch
the
man
retained
the
quinine
as
far
as
the
engine
room
entrance
eight
bells
presently
i
also
must
go
and
pretend
to
sleep
the
surgeon
s
last
cheery
comment
on
the
cosmic
scheme
remains
but
as
a
wry
smile
on
our
faces
we
grope
in
our
minds
desperately
for
a
topic
to
keep
the
talk
afloat
there
goes
one
bell
i
arrive
at
my
haunt
of
cockroaches
where
the
second
mate
is
already
asleep
on
the
upper
shelf
the
brown
light
of
the
oil
lamp
has
its
familiar
flavour
and
the
cabin
is
like
an
oven
what
a
prospect
for
sleep
raising
the
mosquito
curtain
carefully
i
slip
through
the
opening
like
an
acrobat
hoping
to
be
ahead
of
the
insidious
little
malaria
carriers
a
drove
of
cockroaches
scuttles
wildly
over
my
warm
mattress
as
i
arrive
striking
matches
within
what
the
sailor
overhead
calls
my
meat
safe
i
examine
my
enclosure
carefully
for
mosquitoes
but
none
seems
to
be
there
though
i
know
very
well
i
shall
find
at
least
a
dozen
gorged
with
blood
in
the
morning
the
iron
bulkhead
which
separates
my
bed
from
the
engine
room
is
of
course
hot
to
the
touch
the
air
is
a
passive
weight
the
old
insect
bites
begin
to
irritate
and
burn
i
kick
the
miserable
sheet
to
the
foot
and
lie
on
my
back
without
a
movement
for
i
fear
i
may
suffocate
in
that
shut
box
my
chest
seems
in
bonds
and
for
long
there
is
no
relief
though
the
body
presently
grows
indifferent
to
the
misery
and
the
anxiety
goes
it
is
remarkable
to
what
brutality
the
body
will
submit
when
it
knows
it
must
yet
nothing
but
a
continuous
effort
of
will
kept
the
panic
suppressed
and
me
in
that
box
till
the
feeling
of
anxiety
had
passed
thenceforward
the
sleepless
mind
like
a
petty
balloon
giddy
on
a
thin
but
unbreakable
thread
of
thought
would
tug
at
my
consciousness
revolving
and
dodging
about
in
spite
of
my
resolution
to
keep
it
still
if
i
could
only
break
that
thread
i
said
to
myself
turning
over
again
away
it
would
fly
out
of
sight
and
i
should
forget
all
this
all
this
and
presently
it
broke
loose
and
dwindled
into
oblivion
then
i
knew
nothing
more
till
i
saw
fixed
where
i
was
in
hopeless
horror
the
baby
face
of
one
i
dwell
much
upon
in
moments
of
solitude
and
it
had
fallen
wan
and
thin
and
was
full
of
woe
unutterable
and
its
appealing
eyes
were
blind
i
woke
with
a
cry
sitting
up
suddenly
the
heart
going
like
a
rapid
hammer
there
was
the
curtained
box
about
me
the
clothes
were
on
the
hooks
i
could
see
the
black
shape
of
the
cabin
doorway
by
my
watch
it
was
four
o
clock
the
air
had
cooled
and
as
i
sat
waiting
for
the
next
thing
in
the
silence
the
mate
snored
profoundly
overhead
ah
so
that
was
all
right
this
has
been
a
day
of
anxious
navigation
for
the
river
has
had
frequent
reefs
we
remain
in
a
stagnant
chasm
of
trees
the
surgeon
and
i
accompanied
by
a
swarm
of
flies
went
forward
into
the
cattle
stew
this
morning
to
see
how
the
beasts
fared
the
patient
brutes
were
suffering
badly
and
some
quite
plainly
were
dying
the
change
from
the
lush
green
stuff
of
the
itacoatiara
swamps
to
compressed
american
hay
put
under
their
noses
on
an
iron
deck
and
the
stifling
heat
under
partial
awnings
had
ruined
them
some
stood
heads
down
legs
straddled
too
indifferent
to
disperse
the
loathly
clouds
of
parasites
most
were
plagued
by
ticks
which
had
the
tenacity
and
appearance
of
iron
bolt
heads
but
the
little
black
cow
the
rebel
blared
at
us
bound
and
suffering
as
she
was
vive
la
revolution
we
drove
the
flies
from
her
hide
and
she
tried
to
kick
us
the
darling
we
found
a
steer
with
his
shoulder
out
of
joint
lying
inert
in
the
sun
indifferent
to
further
outrage
that
had
to
be
seen
to
and
we
told
the
skipper
who
ordered
it
to
be
killed
we
wanted
some
fresh
meat
badly
he
added
the
boatswain
explained
that
he
knew
the
business
and
he
brought
a
long
knife
and
quite
calmly
thrust
it
into
the
front
of
the
prone
creature
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
find
its
heart
nothing
happened
except
a
little
blood
and
some
convulsive
movements
another
sailor
produced
a
short
knife
and
a
hammer
and
tapped
away
behind
the
horns
as
though
he
were
a
mason
and
this
were
stone
the
frowning
surgeon
supposed
the
fellow
was
trying
to
sever
the
vertebrae
i
don
t
know
yet
another
fellow
jumped
on
its
abdomen
at
last
it
died
i
put
down
merely
what
happened
no
two
voyages
are
alike
and
as
this
episode
came
into
mine
here
it
is
to
be
worked
in
with
the
sunsets
and
things
there
was
some
cheerful
talk
at
the
prospect
of
the
first
fresh
meat
since
england
and
later
passing
the
cook
s
galley
i
saw
an
iron
bin
and
lifted
its
cover
to
see
what
was
there
and
there
was
as
i
judged
there
would
be
liver
for
tea
that
evening
but
i
learned
that
though
i
am
a
carnivore
yet
i
have
not
the
pluck
to
be
a
vulture
the
next
day
we
passed
the
cidada
de
humayta
the
chief
town
on
the
madeira
actually
it
was
of
the
size
of
an
unimportant
home
village
there
was
nothing
there
to
support
the
pilot
s
sonorous
title
of
cidada
for
some
reason
we
were
visited
by
an
extraordinary
number
of
butterflies
one
large
specimen
was
of
an
olive
green
barred
with
black
another
had
wings
of
a
bluish
grey
striped
with
vermilion
helicons
came
and
once
a
morpho
the
latter
a
great
rarity
away
from
the
interior
of
the
woods
at
four
in
the
afternoon
the
sky
grew
ominous
we
had
just
time
to
notice
the
trees
astern
suddenly
convulsed
writhing
where
they
stood
and
the
storm
sprang
at
us
roaring
ripping
away
awnings
and
loose
gear
the
noise
in
the
forest
round
us
was
that
of
cataclysm
the
rain
was
an
obscurity
of
falling
water
and
the
trees
turned
to
shadows
in
a
grey
fog
the
ship
became
full
of
waterspouts
large
streams
and
jets
curving
away
from
every
prominence
this
lasted
for
but
twenty
minutes
but
the
impending
clouds
remained
to
hasten
night
when
we
were
in
a
place
which
more
than
anything
i
have
seen
was
the
world
before
the
coming
of
man
the
river
had
broadened
and
shallowed
the
forest
enclosed
us
there
were
islands
and
the
rank
growth
of
swamps
we
could
see
through
breaks
in
the
igapo
extensive
lagoons
beyond
with
the
high
jungle
brooding
over
empty
silver
areas
herons
storks
and
egrets
were
white
and
still
about
the
tangle
of
aqueous
roots
it
was
all
as
silent
and
other
world
as
a
picture
when
shouting
awakened
me
this
morning
i
saw
the
chief
hurry
by
my
cabin
and
looking
very
anxious
by
the
almost
stationary
foliage
i
could
see
the
ship
had
merely
way
on
her
out
i
jumped
on
the
forecastle
head
a
crowd
was
gathered
peering
overside
a
large
tree
was
balanced
accurately
athwart
our
stem
and
refused
to
move
what
worried
the
staff
was
that
it
would
when
free
sidle
along
our
plates
till
it
fouled
the
propeller
the
propeller
had
to
be
kept
moving
for
the
river
was
narrow
and
its
current
unusually
rapid
there
the
log
obstinately
remained
for
the
most
of
an
hour
but
suddenly
made
up
its
mind
and
went
clearing
the
stern
by
inches
after
that
the
engines
were
driven
full
for
the
pilot
hoped
to
get
us
to
porto
velho
by
nightfall
in
the
late
afternoon
when
passing
the
rio
jamary
the
clouds
again
banked
astern
bringing
night
before
its
time
and
another
violent
storm
compelled
an
early
anchorage
the
forest
was
remarkably
quiet
after
the
tumult
of
the
squall
and
the
capella
had
been
put
over
to
the
left
bank
when
close
to
us
on
the
opposite
shore
there
was
a
landslip
we
saw
a
section
of
the
jungle
wall
sway
as
though
that
part
was
taken
by
a
local
tempest
and
then
the
green
cliff
and
its
supports
fell
bodily
into
the
river
raising
thunderous
submarine
explosions
such
landslides
terras
cahidas
can
be
rarely
foreseen
and
are
a
grave
danger
to
craft
when
they
come
close
in
to
rest
at
night
we
passed
a
small
raft
drifting
down
a
hut
was
erected
in
its
middle
and
we
saw
two
men
within
talk
enough
there
has
been
of
a
place
called
porto
velho
a
name
i
heard
first
when
i
signed
the
articles
of
the
capella
at
swansea
and
of
what
would
happen
to
us
when
we
arrived
but
i
am
looking
upon
it
all
as
a
strange
myth
there
has
been
time
to
prove
those
superstitions
of
porto
velho
and
what
has
happened
there
was
a
month
we
had
of
the
vacant
sea
and
one
day
we
came
upon
a
low
coast
where
palms
grew
there
has
been
a
month
which
has
striped
the
vacant
mind
in
three
colours
constant
in
relative
position
but
without
form
yellow
floor
green
walls
and
a
blue
ceiling
plainly
we
have
got
beyond
all
the
works
of
man
now
we
have
intrigued
an
ocean
steamer
thousands
of
miles
along
the
devious
waterways
of
an
uninhabited
continental
jungle
and
now
she
must
be
near
the
middle
of
the
puzzle
with
voiceless
regions
of
unexplored
forest
reeking
under
the
equatorial
sun
at
every
point
of
the
compass
the
more
we
advance
up
the
amazon
and
madeira
rivers
the
less
the
likelihood
it
seems
to
me
of
getting
to
any
place
where
our
ship
and
cargo
could
be
required
we
shall
steam
and
steam
till
the
river
shallows
the
forest
closes
in
and
we
are
trapped
yet
the
madeira
looks
now
much
the
same
as
when
we
entered
it
still
as
broad
and
deep
i
was
thinking
this
morning
we
might
go
on
so
for
ever
that
this
adventure
was
all
of
the
casual
improbabilities
of
a
dream
was
in
my
mind
when
smoking
the
after
breakfast
pipe
on
the
bridge
we
turned
a
corner
sharply
and
there
was
the
end
of
the
passage
within
a
mile
of
us
porto
velho
at
last
the
forest
on
the
port
side
ahead
was
uplifted
on
an
unusually
high
cliff
of
the
red
rock
beyond
that
cliff
was
a
considerable
clearing
with
many
buildings
of
a
character
different
from
any
we
had
seen
in
the
country
at
the
end
of
the
clearing
the
forest
began
again
unconquered
still
standing
across
our
course
as
a
high
barrier
for
leaving
porto
velho
the
river
turned
west
almost
at
a
right
angle
and
vanished
as
though
now
it
were
done
with
us
we
had
arrived
a
rough
pier
was
being
thrown
out
on
palm
boles
to
receive
us
but
it
was
not
ready
we
anchored
in
five
fathoms
about
thirty
yards
from
the
shore
and
in
the
quiet
which
came
with
the
stop
of
the
ship
s
life
we
waited
for
the
next
thing
all
hands
lining
the
capella
s
side
surveying
this
place
of
which
we
had
heard
so
much
plainly
this
was
not
the
usual
village
many
acres
of
trees
had
been
newly
cleared
leaving
a
great
bay
in
the
woods
the
earth
was
still
raw
from
a
recent
attack
on
what
had
been
inviolate
from
time
s
beginning
trenches
new
red
gashes
scored
it
and
holes
were
gouged
in
the
hill
side
you
could
think
man
had
attacked
the
forest
here
in
a
fury
but
had
spent
his
force
on
one
small
spot
as
though
he
had
struck
one
wound
again
and
again
the
fight
was
over
the
footing
had
been
won
a
base
perhaps
for
further
campaigns
because
wooden
emergency
houses
sheds
and
barracks
had
been
built
the
assailant
evidently
had
made
up
his
mind
to
settle
on
his
advantage
though
he
was
tolerating
a
little
quickly
rebellious
scrub
just
then
he
was
resting
as
if
the
whole
affair
had
been
over
but
five
minutes
before
we
came
and
now
the
conqueror
was
sleeping
on
his
first
success
completely
round
the
conquered
space
the
jungle
stood
indifferently
regarding
the
trifle
of
ground
it
had
lost
the
jungle
on
the
near
opposite
shore
rose
straight
and
uninterrupted
from
the
river
the
front
rank
lost
each
way
in
distance
of
an
innumerable
army
at
the
upper
end
of
the
clearing
the
jungle
began
again
on
our
side
and
turned
to
run
across
our
bows
the
complement
of
the
host
across
the
water
and
both
ranks
continued
up
stream
dark
and
indeterminate
lines
converging
till
three
miles
away
a
delicate
flickering
of
light
a
mere
dimmer
faint
but
constant
bridged
the
two
walls
no
doubt
that
delicate
light
would
be
the
san
antonio
cataracts
the
first
of
the
nineteen
rapids
of
the
madeira
porto
velho
behaved
as
though
we
were
not
there
a
pitiless
sun
flamed
over
that
deep
red
wound
in
the
forest
and
they
who
had
made
it
were
in
their
shelters
resting
out
of
sight
after
such
a
recent
riot
of
exertion
nothing
was
being
done
then
two
or
three
white
men
stood
on
the
dismantled
foreshore
placidly
regarding
us
we
might
have
been
something
they
were
not
quite
sure
was
there
a
possibility
not
sufficiently
interesting
for
them
to
verify
there
was
a
hint
of
mockery
after
all
our
anxiety
and
travail
in
this
quiet
disregard
had
we
arrived
too
late
to
help
and
so
were
not
wanted
i
confess
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
to
have
heard
suppressed
laughter
some
light
hilarity
from
the
unseen
at
us
innocently
puzzling
as
to
what
was
to
happen
next
there
was
a
violent
scream
in
the
forest
near
our
bows
and
we
turned
wondering
to
that
green
wall
a
locomotive
ran
out
from
the
base
of
the
trees
still
screaming
in
a
little
while
a
man
left
a
house
striding
down
over
the
debris
to
the
foreshore
and
some
brought
him
in
a
canoe
to
the
he
was
a
tall
youngster
an
american
and
his
slow
body
itself
was
but
a
thin
sallow
drawl
only
his
eyes
were
alert
and
they
darted
at
ours
in
quick
scrutiny
his
solemn
occupying
assurance
and
accent
precipitated
reality
he
was
a
doctor
and
he
ordered
us
to
be
mustered
on
the
after
deck
for
inspection
for
yellow
fever
we
were
passed
and
then
this
doctor
went
below
to
the
saloon
distributing
his
long
limbs
and
body
over
several
chairs
and
part
of
the
table
and
began
with
lazy
words
and
gestures
to
give
us
a
place
in
the
scene
we
learned
we
should
stay
as
we
were
till
the
pier
was
finished
and
that
the
railway
was
actually
in
being
for
a
short
distance
he
said
something
about
porto
velho
being
hell
he
left
us
we
sat
about
on
deck
furniture
and
waited
on
the
unknown
gods
of
the
land
to
see
what
they
would
send
us
all
day
in
the
clearing
figures
moved
about
on
some
mysterious
business
but
seldom
looked
at
us
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
watch
the
raft
of
timber
and
flotsam
expand
about
our
hawsers
a
matter
of
some
concern
to
us
for
the
current
ran
at
six
knots
our
brief
sense
of
contact
got
from
the
medical
inspection
had
gone
by
night
reality
contracted
closing
in
upon
the
capella
with
rapidly
diminishing
radii
as
the
light
went
till
we
had
lost
everything
but
our
steamer
into
the
saloon
where
some
of
us
sat
listening
in
sympathy
to
the
skipper
s
growls
that
night
burst
our
cook
disrespectful
and
tousled
saying
he
had
seen
a
canoe
which
bore
a
light
overturn
in
the
river
there
was
a
stampede
we
each
seized
a
lantern
and
leaned
overside
with
it
with
that
fatuous
eagerness
to
help
which
makes
a
man
strike
matches
when
looking
for
one
who
is
lost
on
a
moor
ghostly
logs
came
floating
noiselessly
out
of
darkness
into
the
brief
domain
of
our
lanterns
and
faded
into
night
again
from
somewhere
in
the
collection
of
driftwood
beyond
our
bows
we
thought
we
heard
an
occasional
cry
though
that
might
have
been
the
noise
of
water
sucking
through
the
rubbish
or
the
creaking
of
timbers
our
chief
mate
got
out
a
small
boat
and
vanished
and
we
were
already
growing
anxious
for
him
when
his
luminous
grin
appeared
below
in
the
range
of
my
lantern
and
with
him
came
the
ponderous
figure
of
a
man
the
latter
deft
and
agile
came
up
the
rope
ladder
and
stepped
aboard
with
innocent
inconsequence
shocking
my
sense
of
the
gravity
of
the
affair
for
this
streaming
object
lifted
from
the
grip
of
the
boney
one
just
in
time
was
chuckling
say
said
this
big
ruddy
man
to
our
gaping
crowd
i
met
a
nigger
ashore
with
a
letter
for
the
captain
of
this
packet
said
he
didn
t
know
how
to
get
so
i
brought
it
but
a
tree
overturned
the
canoe
i
came
up
under
the
timber
jam
all
right
all
right
but
it
took
me
quite
a
piece
to
get
my
head
in
the
saloon
with
a
pool
of
water
spreading
round
him
while
we
got
him
some
dry
clothes
he
produced
this
pulpy
letter
dear
captain
it
ran
i
m
as
dry
as
hell
have
you
brought
drinks
in
the
ship
the
bland
indifference
of
porto
velho
to
the
capella
which
had
done
so
much
to
get
there
the
locomotive
which
ran
screaming
out
of
those
woods
where
till
then
was
the
same
unbroken
front
which
from
para
inwards
had
surrendered
nothing
the
inconsequential
doctor
who
carefully
examined
us
for
what
we
had
not
got
the
ruddy
man
who
rose
to
us
streaming
out
of
the
deeps
as
though
that
were
his
usual
approach
bearing
another
stranger
s
unreasonable
letter
complaining
of
thirst
were
most
puzzling
i
even
felt
some
anxiety
and
suspicion
what
then
were
all
the
other
incidents
of
our
difficult
six
thousand
mile
voyage
what
was
this
place
to
which
we
had
come
on
urgent
business
long
and
carefully
deliberated
where
men
merely
looked
at
the
whites
of
our
eyes
or
changed
wet
clothes
in
the
saloon
or
lightly
referred
to
all
did
if
hell
were
an
unremarkable
feature
of
their
day
were
all
these
unrelated
shadows
and
movements
but
part
of
a
long
and
witless
jest
the
point
of
it
i
could
not
see
was
there
any
point
to
it
or
did
casual
episodes
appear
at
unexpected
places
till
they
came
just
as
unexpectedly
to
an
empty
end
the
man
the
mate
had
rescued
sat
at
the
saloon
table
opposite
me
leaning
a
yard
wide
chest
which
was
almost
bare
on
the
red
baize
his
bulging
arms
resting
before
him
and
his
hairy
paws
easily
clasped
i
thought
that
perhaps
this
imperturbable
being
who
could
come
with
easy
assurance
his
bright
friendly
eyes
merely
amused
his
large
firm
mouth
merely
mocking
and
his
face
heated
from
a
desperate
affair
in
which
his
life
nearly
went
to
announce
to
strangers
boys
i
m
old
man
jim
must
have
had
the
point
of
the
joke
revealed
to
him
long
since
and
so
now
had
no
respect
for
its
setting
and
could
have
no
care
and
understanding
of
my
anxious
innocence
he
sat
there
for
hours
in
quiet
discourse
i
listened
to
him
with
my
ears
only
his
words
jostling
my
thoughts
as
one
would
puzzle
over
and
listen
to
a
superior
being
which
had
unbent
to
be
intimate
but
was
outside
our
experience
i
heard
he
had
been
at
this
place
since
he
began
the
work
here
porto
velho
did
not
then
exist
off
where
we
were
anchored
the
jungle
rose
he
had
his
young
son
with
him
a
cousin
and
two
negroes
and
he
began
the
railway
inside
the
trees
he
said
they
could
not
see
three
yards
but
down
it
all
had
to
come
there
is
a
small
stingless
bee
here
which
old
man
jim
called
the
sweat
bee
it
alights
in
swarms
on
the
face
and
hands
and
prefers
death
to
being
dislodged
from
its
enjoyment
the
heat
these
bees
the
ants
the
pium
flies
the
mosquitoes
made
the
existence
of
jim
and
his
mates
a
misery
jim
merely
drawled
about
in
a
comic
way
fever
came
and
mistrust
of
natives
compelled
him
to
dress
a
dummy
put
that
in
his
hammock
at
night
while
he
slept
in
a
corner
of
the
hut
one
eye
open
nursing
a
gun
i
could
not
see
old
man
jim
ever
having
faith
that
trains
would
run
or
needed
to
run
where
indians
lurked
in
the
bush
and
jaguars
nosed
round
the
hut
at
night
why
these
sufferings
then
but
we
learned
the
line
now
penetrated
into
the
forest
for
sixty
miles
and
that
beyond
it
there
were
camps
where
surveyors
were
seeing
that
further
way
was
made
and
beyond
them
again
among
the
trees
of
the
interior
the
surveyors
were
still
planning
the
way
the
line
should
run
when
it
had
got
so
far
though
we
could
not
get
ashore
there
was
enough
to
watch
if
it
were
only
the
men
leisurely
driving
palm
boles
into
the
river
making
a
pier
for
us
while
at
breakfast
a
canoe
of
came
flying
towards
us
in
pursuit
of
an
object
which
kept
a
little
ahead
of
them
in
the
river
it
passed
close
under
our
stern
and
we
saw
it
was
a
peccary
the
canoe
ran
level
with
it
then
and
a
man
leaned
over
catching
the
wild
pig
by
a
hind
leg
keeping
its
snout
under
water
while
another
secured
its
feet
with
rope
it
was
brought
aboard
in
bonds
as
a
present
for
the
skipper
who
begged
the
natives
to
convey
it
below
to
the
bunkers
and
there
release
it
he
said
he
would
tame
it
i
saw
the
eye
of
the
beast
as
it
lay
on
the
deck
champing
its
tusks
viciously
and
guessed
we
should
have
some
interesting
moments
while
kindness
tried
to
reduce
that
light
in
its
eye
the
peccary
disappeared
for
a
few
days
there
being
nothing
to
do
this
fine
morning
we
watched
the
cattle
put
ashore
this
was
not
so
difficult
a
business
as
shipping
them
for
the
beasts
now
submitted
quietly
to
the
noose
which
was
put
on
their
horns
the
steam
tackle
hoisted
them
they
were
pushed
overside
and
dropped
into
the
river
some
natives
in
a
canoe
cleared
the
horns
and
the
brute
swimming
desperately
in
the
strong
current
was
guided
to
the
bank
some
of
the
beasts
being
already
near
death
they
were
merely
jettisoned
the
current
bore
them
down
stream
making
feeble
efforts
to
for
the
alligators
we
waited
for
the
turn
of
the
black
heifer
she
was
one
of
the
last
she
was
not
led
to
the
ship
s
side
the
tackle
was
attached
to
her
horns
and
made
taut
before
her
head
was
loosed
she
made
a
furious
lunge
at
the
men
when
her
nose
was
free
but
the
winch
rattled
and
she
was
brought
up
on
her
hind
legs
blaring
at
us
all
in
that
ugly
manner
she
was
walked
on
two
legs
across
the
deck
a
heroine
in
shameful
guise
while
the
men
laughed
she
was
hoisted
and
lowered
into
the
river
she
fought
at
the
waiting
canoe
with
her
feet
but
at
last
the
men
released
her
horns
from
the
tackle
with
only
her
face
above
water
she
heaved
herself
open
mouthed
at
the
canoe
trying
to
bite
it
and
then
made
some
almost
successful
efforts
to
climb
into
it
the
canoe
men
were
so
that
they
did
nothing
but
muddle
one
another
s
efforts
the
canoe
rocked
dangerously
this
wicked
animal
had
no
care
for
its
own
safety
like
other
cattle
it
surprised
its
tormentors
because
it
showed
its
only
wish
was
to
kill
them
just
in
time
the
men
paddled
off
for
their
lives
the
cow
after
them
seeing
she
could
not
catch
them
she
swam
ashore
climbed
the
bank
looking
round
then
for
a
sight
of
the
they
were
all
in
then
began
browsing
in
the
scrub
as
leisurely
as
though
life
were
without
end
the
work
on
the
pier
proceeded
and
we
on
the
capella
who
could
not
get
ashore
with
each
of
our
days
a
week
long
looked
round
upon
this
remote
place
of
the
american
tropics
till
it
seemed
we
had
never
looked
upon
anything
else
the
days
were
candent
and
vaporous
the
heat
by
being
such
as
we
know
at
home
in
an
early
afternoon
of
the
the
forest
across
the
river
about
three
hundred
yards
away
from
sunrise
till
eight
o
clock
often
was
veiled
in
a
white
fog
there
would
be
a
clear
river
and
a
sky
that
was
full
day
but
not
the
least
suspicion
of
a
forest
we
saw
what
seemed
a
limitless
expanse
of
bright
water
which
merged
into
the
opalescent
sky
walls
such
an
invisible
fog
melted
from
below
and
then
the
revelation
of
the
dark
base
of
the
forest
in
was
as
if
our
eyes
were
playing
tricks
the
forest
appeared
in
the
way
one
picture
grows
through
another
the
last
of
the
vapour
would
roll
upwards
from
the
for
some
time
and
you
could
believe
the
woods
were
smouldering
heavily
thenceforward
the
quiet
day
would
be
uninterrupted
except
for
the
plunge
of
a
heavy
fish
the
passing
of
a
canoe
a
visit
from
an
adventurous
visitor
from
the
shore
or
the
growing
of
a
cloud
in
the
sky
we
tried
fishing
though
never
got
anything
but
some
grey
scaleless
creatures
with
feelers
hanging
about
their
gills
it
was
not
till
the
evening
when
the
visitors
usually
came
that
the
day
began
really
to
move
the
new
voices
gave
our
saloon
and
cabins
vivacity
and
the
stories
we
heard
carried
us
far
and
swiftly
towards
the
next
they
were
strange
characters
those
visitors
usually
americans
but
sometimes
we
got
an
englishman
or
a
frenchman
they
took
possession
of
the
ship
there
was
an
elderly
man
neil
o
brien
who
was
often
with
us
at
first
i
thought
he
was
a
very
exceptional
character
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
visit
our
ship
i
even
felt
a
little
timidity
when
alone
with
him
for
he
had
a
habit
of
sitting
limply
looking
at
nothing
in
particular
and
dumb
and
plainly
he
was
a
man
whose
thoughts
ran
in
ways
i
could
not
even
surmise
his
pale
blue
eyes
would
turn
upon
me
with
that
searching
openness
which
may
mean
childish
innocence
or
madness
and
i
could
not
forget
the
whispers
i
had
heard
of
his
dangerously
inflammable
nature
i
could
not
find
common
footing
with
him
for
some
time
my
trouble
was
that
i
had
come
out
direct
from
a
country
where
few
men
are
free
and
so
most
of
us
live
in
doubt
of
what
would
happen
to
us
if
we
were
to
act
as
though
we
were
free
men
where
if
a
man
contemptuously
dares
to
a
bleak
and
perilous
extremity
he
makes
all
his
lawful
fellows
their
timid
breaths
that
land
where
even
a
reward
has
been
instituted
as
for
merit
for
uncomplaining
endurance
under
hardships
and
called
an
pension
you
can
not
live
much
of
your
life
with
natural
servants
the
judicious
and
impartial
the
light
shy
and
those
who
look
twice
carefully
but
never
leap
without
betraying
some
reflected
pallor
of
their
anæmia
o
brien
the
quiet
master
of
his
own
time
with
his
eyes
i
could
not
read
and
his
gun
betrayed
obliquely
in
our
casual
talks
together
such
an
ingenuous
indifference
to
accepted
things
and
authority
that
i
had
nothing
to
work
with
when
gauging
him
he
was
his
own
standard
of
conduct
i
judged
his
bearing
towards
the
authority
of
officials
would
be
tolerant
and
even
tender
as
men
use
with
wilful
children
he
was
not
a
rebel
as
we
understand
it
one
who
at
last
grows
impatient
and
angry
and
so
votes
for
the
other
party
i
suppose
he
was
not
opposed
to
authority
unless
it
were
opposed
to
him
he
was
outside
any
authority
but
his
own
he
lived
without
state
aid
he
himself
carried
the
gun
always
the
symbol
of
authority
whether
of
a
man
or
of
a
state
and
if
any
man
had
attempted
to
rob
him
of
his
substance
certainly
o
brien
would
have
shot
that
man
according
to
his
own
law
and
his
own
prophecy
and
would
then
have
cooked
his
supper
he
surprised
me
for
a
day
or
two
i
puzzled
much
over
this
phenomenon
of
a
free
man
who
took
his
freedom
so
quietly
and
naturally
that
he
never
even
discussed
the
subject
as
we
do
with
enthusiasm
in
england
what
else
it
was
long
since
he
was
separated
from
his
mother
soon
i
found
he
was
but
a
type
i
met
others
like
him
in
this
country
their
innocence
of
the
limitations
of
a
careful
man
like
myself
was
disconcerting
once
o
brien
casually
proposed
that
i
should
beat
it
cut
the
ship
and
make
a
traverse
of
that
wild
place
to
distant
colombia
to
some
unknown
spot
by
the
approximate
source
of
a
certain
amazon
tributary
where
he
knew
there
was
gold
first
i
laughed
and
then
found
from
his
glance
of
resentful
candour
that
he
was
quite
serious
he
generously
meant
this
honour
for
me
and
i
think
it
was
an
honour
for
an
elderly
quiet
and
seasoned
privateer
like
o
brien
to
invite
me
to
be
his
only
companion
in
a
region
where
you
must
travel
with
alert
courage
and
wide
experience
or
perish
i
have
learned
since
he
has
gone
to
that
far
place
alone
but
what
a
time
he
will
have
he
will
have
all
of
it
to
himself
was
thinking
when
i
refused
him
of
my
old
age
pension
i
should
like
to
get
it
men
like
o
brien
are
called
here
quite
respectfully
bad
men
and
land
the
lawless
lands
of
the
south
american
in
this
sense
that
their
laws
need
be
little
reckoned
by
the
daring
the
strong
and
the
particularly
attractive
to
men
of
the
o
brien
type
i
got
to
like
them
i
found
them
when
once
used
to
their
feral
minds
always
entertaining
and
often
instructive
for
their
naïve
opinions
cut
our
conventions
across
the
middle
showing
the
surprising
insides
they
dwell
without
bounds
as
i
have
read
somewhere
we
do
not
think
of
the
buffalo
which
treats
a
continent
as
pasturage
as
we
do
of
the
cow
which
kicks
over
the
pail
at
milking
time
and
jumps
the
yard
fence
these
men
regard
priest
magistrate
and
soldier
with
an
indifference
which
is
not
even
contemptible
indifference
they
are
merely
callous
to
the
calculated
effect
of
uniforms
when
in
luck
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
cities
shy
and
a
little
miserable
having
a
good
time
their
money
gone
they
set
out
on
lonely
journeys
across
this
continent
which
show
our
fuss
over
authentic
explorers
to
be
a
little
overdone
o
brien
was
such
a
man
he
told
me
he
had
not
slept
under
a
roof
for
years
he
had
no
home
he
confessed
to
me
once
any
place
on
the
map
was
the
same
to
him
he
had
spent
his
life
drifting
alone
between
patagonia
and
canada
looking
for
what
he
never
found
if
he
knew
what
he
was
looking
for
his
travels
were
insignificant
to
him
he
might
have
been
a
tramp
talking
of
english
highways
as
he
droned
on
one
evening
i
began
to
doubt
he
was
unaware
that
his
was
an
extraordinary
narrative
i
guessed
his
unconcern
must
be
an
air
it
would
have
been
in
my
case
i
looked
straight
over
at
him
and
he
hesitated
nervously
and
stopped
was
he
wasting
my
time
he
asked
prospecting
for
his
illusion
his
last
journey
was
over
the
peruvian
andes
into
colombia
he
broke
an
arm
in
a
fall
on
the
mountains
set
it
himself
and
continued
on
the
rio
japura
an
indian
shot
an
arrow
through
his
leg
and
o
brien
dropped
in
the
long
grass
breaking
the
arrow
short
each
side
of
the
limb
and
in
an
ensuing
long
watchful
duel
presently
shot
the
indian
through
the
throat
and
then
coming
out
on
the
amazon
his
canoe
overturned
and
the
pickle
jar
full
of
gold
dust
was
lost
he
put
no
emphasis
on
any
particular
not
even
on
the
loss
of
his
gold
he
was
pointed
out
to
me
first
as
a
singular
fellow
who
kept
doves
a
tall
gaunt
man
with
a
deliberate
gait
perhaps
fifty
years
of
age
in
old
garments
long
boots
laced
to
the
knees
and
a
battered
pith
helmet
he
strolled
along
with
his
eyes
cast
down
if
you
met
him
abroad
and
stopped
him
he
answered
you
with
a
few
mumbles
while
looking
away
over
your
shoulder
his
big
mouth
drew
down
a
grizzled
moustache
cynically
and
one
of
his
front
teeth
was
gold
plated
before
he
passed
on
he
looked
at
you
with
the
haughty
but
doubtful
stare
of
an
animal
he
seemed
too
slow
and
dull
to
be
combustible
i
ceased
to
credit
those
tales
of
his
berserker
rage
he
always
moved
in
that
deliberate
way
as
if
he
were
careful
but
bored
or
he
stood
before
his
doves
and
made
bubbling
noises
in
his
loose
stringy
throat
he
embarrassed
me
with
a
present
of
many
of
the
trophies
he
had
secured
in
years
of
travel
in
the
wilds
one
day
a
negro
and
o
brien
were
in
mild
dispute
on
the
jetty
and
the
negro
called
the
white
a
yankee
the
river
was
twenty
feet
below
swiftly
carrying
its
logs
o
brien
took
the
big
black
and
with
vicious
ease
threw
him
into
the
water
the
negro
missed
the
floating
rubbish
and
struck
out
for
the
bank
no
one
could
help
him
by
good
luck
he
managed
to
get
to
the
waterside
yet
o
brien
meanwhile
had
hurried
his
long
legs
over
the
ties
of
the
skeleton
structure
his
face
transfigured
and
was
waiting
for
the
negro
to
emerge
a
spade
in
his
hand
but
under
other
circumstances
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
he
would
have
fought
the
brazilian
army
and
so
finished
in
defence
of
that
same
negro
iv
night
brought
one
of
these
men
to
each
of
our
cabins
and
put
a
party
of
them
drinking
in
the
saloon
after
my
habit
of
thinking
of
people
in
crowds
as
an
anglican
church
or
an
ethical
society
a
labour
movement
a
federation
of
proprietors
or
suffragists
or
jews
or
stockbrokers
clerks
crowds
moving
with
massed
exactitude
by
the
thousand
at
least
when
prompted
this
man
o
brien
standing
on
his
two
legs
by
himself
old
man
jim
and
the
rest
each
of
them
defending
and
running
his
own
particular
kingdom
and
governing
that
ill
or
i
saw
them
fairly
drunk
now
and
never
waiting
for
a
word
from
any
master
or
delegate
made
me
wonder
whether
till
then
i
had
met
a
living
man
or
had
heard
merely
of
a
population
of
bundles
of
newspapers
these
men
had
no
leaders
they
attended
to
all
that
each
had
to
find
his
own
way
they
were
unrelated
to
anything
i
knew
and
beyond
the
help
of
even
a
candidate
for
parliament
i
suppose
they
had
never
heard
of
a
defence
league
they
could
have
found
no
use
for
it
because
a
challenge
to
defend
themselves
would
never
catch
them
unwilling
or
unable
each
man
soldiered
himself
and
perhaps
was
rather
too
ready
to
deal
with
a
show
of
insolence
or
an
assumption
of
power
in
another
yet
they
were
not
the
violent
and
headstrong
fellows
of
romantic
tales
they
were
simple
and
kind
submitting
with
a
sick
smile
to
the
prickly
ridicule
of
their
fellows
round
the
board
they
regarded
meat
drink
and
tobacco
as
common
they
were
ready
to
leap
into
the
dark
for
a
friend
there
was
one
young
bearded
englishman
among
them
who
was
more
than
a
friendly
figure
to
me
all
were
friendly
but
the
americans
bore
themselves
with
the
easy
assurance
of
the
favoured
heirs
of
adam
though
their
successful
work
in
that
tropical
swamp
perhaps
justified
them
the
englishman
had
less
of
that
assurance
of
a
unique
favour
which
was
so
completely
bestowed
that
irresolution
never
shook
the
aplomb
of
its
lucky
inheritors
he
came
into
my
cabin
one
night
hoping
he
was
not
disturbing
me
and
bringing
as
a
present
a
sheaf
of
native
arrows
tipped
with
red
and
blue
macaw
feathers
as
he
had
promised
they
come
from
hundred
miles
from
he
explained
he
had
reached
our
point
in
the
brazilian
forest
from
the
pacific
side
he
had
crossed
the
mountains
descended
to
the
level
jungle
at
the
base
of
the
andean
wall
and
followed
the
rivers
eastward
alone
in
a
canoe
till
he
chanced
upon
our
steamer
unloading
welsh
fuel
into
a
forest
clearing
to
a
in
a
mysterious
land
this
was
a
clear
invitation
to
listen
and
i
looked
at
the
man
expectantly
he
was
lighting
his
pipe
the
country
through
which
he
must
have
passed
was
unknown
as
our
maps
showed
but
he
simply
indicated
that
manner
of
his
advent
as
though
it
were
the
same
as
any
other
and
sat
looking
through
the
door
of
my
cabin
smoking
absently
gazing
at
the
night
scene
on
the
afterdeck
the
hombres
were
working
at
the
hold
immediately
below
us
their
labours
made
obscurely
bright
by
a
roaring
flame
of
volatalised
oil
the
light
pulsed
on
the
face
of
the
englishman
and
chequered
my
cabin
in
black
and
luminous
gold
of
all
the
region
of
forest
about
us
nothing
showed
but
a
cloud
of
leaves
which
leaned
towards
us
out
of
the
night
supported
on
two
pale
tremulous
columns
the
hold
of
the
ship
was
a
black
rectangle
and
the
almost
naked
negroes
and
brown
men
moving
about
it
or
peering
into
the
chasm
were
like
sinister
figures
on
an
inscrutable
business
about
the
verge
of
the
pit
they
were
not
men
but
the
debris
of
men
moving
with
awful
volition
merely
a
bright
cadaverous
mask
hovering
in
a
void
or
two
arms
upheld
or
a
black
headless
trunk
for
the
roaring
illuminant
on
deck
dismembered
the
ship
and
its
occupants
bursting
into
the
weight
of
surrounding
night
as
a
fixed
explosion
beams
rigid
and
glowing
and
shadows
in
long
solid
bars
radiating
from
its
incandescent
heart
i
m
glad
you
re
here
said
my
companion
he
never
gave
me
his
name
and
i
do
not
know
it
now
i
hav
n
t
heard
home
talk
for
a
year
hav
n
t
heard
much
of
anything
a
little
spanish
coming
along
and
here
some
we
continued
looking
at
the
puzzling
disrupted
scene
outside
for
some
time
without
speaking
secure
in
a
chance
and
lucky
sympathy
then
a
basket
of
coal
tipped
against
a
hatch
coaming
and
whirled
away
scattering
the
men
we
rose
to
see
if
any
were
hurt
curious
this
desperate
haste
isn
t
it
said
the
englishman
at
every
point
of
the
compass
from
here
there
s
at
least
a
thousand
miles
of
wilderness
excepting
at
this
place
it
wouldn
t
matter
to
anybody
whether
a
thing
were
done
or
next
week
or
not
at
all
but
look
at
those
d
think
this
was
a
london
wharf
and
a
tide
had
to
be
caught
here
they
are
on
and
overtime
where
there
s
nothing
but
trees
alligators
tigers
and
savages
an
unknown
somebody
in
wall
street
or
park
lane
has
an
idea
and
this
is
what
it
does
the
potent
impulse
it
moves
men
who
don
t
know
the
language
of
new
york
and
london
down
to
this
desolation
it
begins
to
ferment
the
place
the
fructifying
thought
have
you
seen
the
graveyard
here
we
ve
got
a
fine
cemetery
and
it
grows
well
still
this
railway
will
get
done
yes
people
who
don
t
know
what
it
s
for
they
ll
make
a
little
of
it
and
die
and
more
who
don
t
know
what
it
s
for
and
won
t
use
it
when
it
s
made
they
ll
finish
it
this
line
will
get
its
freights
of
precious
rubber
moving
down
to
replenish
the
motor
tyres
of
civilisation
and
the
chap
who
had
the
bright
idea
but
never
saw
this
place
and
couldn
t
live
here
a
week
or
shovel
dirt
or
lay
a
track
and
wouldn
t
know
raw
rubber
if
he
saw
it
he
ll
score
again
progress
progress
the
wilderness
blossoms
as
the
rose
it
s
wonderful
isn
t
it
i
was
just
a
little
annoyed
after
all
i
was
part
of
the
job
i
d
made
my
sacrifices
too
but
i
admitted
what
he
said
why
not
it
was
something
that
fancy
that
every
rattle
of
the
winch
outside
bringing
up
another
load
moved
abruptly
under
the
impulse
of
another
thought
from
london
thousand
miles
away
two
months
travel
great
london
town
it
was
true
if
london
shut
off
its
good
will
that
winch
would
stop
and
the
locomotives
would
come
to
a
stand
to
rot
under
the
trees
and
the
lianas
would
lock
their
wheels
and
in
a
month
the
forest
would
have
foundered
the
track
under
a
green
flood
where
the
american
accent
was
dominant
the
jaguars
would
moan
at
night
that
long
wound
in
the
forest
would
be
annealed
and
invisible
in
a
year
while
it
persisted
the
idea
could
conquer
and
maintain
yes
but
it
s
all
chance
said
the
englishman
that
uncertain
and
impersonal
will
controls
us
have
you
ever
worked
desperately
the
fever
in
your
bones
at
a
link
in
a
job
the
rest
of
which
was
already
abandoned
though
you
didn
t
know
it
yet
perhaps
even
so
there
is
something
gained
the
knowledge
that
all
you
do
is
fugitive
that
there
is
nothing
but
an
idea
which
may
be
withdrawn
without
warning
at
any
moment
under
the
most
complicated
and
inspiring
structure
having
that
you
can
work
with
a
light
heart
secure
against
betrayal
ready
with
your
own
laugh
when
the
mockery
comes
a
community
finds
it
must
have
a
bridge
wall
street
hears
of
it
and
finances
a
contractor
who
finds
an
architect
to
design
it
an
army
builds
it
and
then
this
blessed
old
planet
moves
in
its
sleep
and
the
obstructing
river
flows
another
way
well
for
us
we
can
rarely
see
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
work
we
are
doing
most
of
the
men
on
this
job
have
not
been
here
three
months
they
come
and
shovel
a
little
dirt
and
die
or
they
get
frightened
and
go
but
that
idea
that
remains
here
using
up
men
and
forests
using
up
all
that
comes
within
its
invisible
influence
drawing
in
material
and
pressing
it
into
its
unseen
mould
so
that
out
of
the
invisible
sprouts
a
railway
projecting
length
by
length
transmuted
men
and
timber
a
courtier
once
gave
his
cloak
to
queen
elizabeth
to
save
her
feet
but
what
is
that
when
these
men
give
their
bodies
to
make
an
easier
road
for
the
commerce
of
their
fellows
they
say
every
sleeper
on
a
tropical
line
represents
a
man
the
conquering
human
who
lives
by
dying
the
unseen
idea
stranger
s
gain
profit
out
of
a
necessity
not
his
filled
by
other
men
unknown
to
him
you
can
t
escape
it
first
and
last
it
uses
you
it
uses
you
up
you
may
twist
and
double
but
when
me
you
fly
i
am
the
wings
as
emerson
says
once
once
i
deliberately
tried
to
escape
from
it
to
get
out
of
its
range
i
thought
it
was
local
that
idea
a
mean
and
local
urge
i
believed
i
had
escaped
it
too
i
was
young
though
then
but
we
all
try
when
we
re
young
there
is
but
one
way
of
may
use
up
others
but
that
isn
t
an
easy
way
of
escape
for
some
of
us
no
alternative
but
that
and
a
man
can
not
take
it
there
you
are
use
or
be
used
once
i
thought
i
had
escaped
once
upon
a
time
every
morning
at
eight
o
clock
i
went
to
an
office
in
leadenhall
street
know
that
place
my
first
job
i
was
one
in
a
crowd
of
fifty
clerks
we
sat
on
high
stools
facing
each
other
across
there
were
brass
rails
above
each
desk
where
we
rested
ledgers
and
letter
baskets
each
of
us
marked
his
stool
somewhere
with
a
personal
symbol
my
own
my
sole
point
of
vantage
there
my
support
in
life
that
high
stool
and
i
would
have
been
prepared
to
maintain
it
our
office
code
of
honour
i
as
firm
as
may
be
upon
if
treacherously
blabbing
i
had
had
to
deprive
all
my
of
their
supports
in
life
we
were
not
a
community
working
out
a
common
ideal
an
idea
used
us
and
that
was
a
job
i
got
as
a
favour
mark
you
some
one
had
known
my
dead
father
i
knew
the
name
of
my
boss
but
that
was
all
i
never
spoke
to
him
i
used
to
see
him
a
man
with
sad
eyes
and
a
petulant
mouth
clean
shaved
and
bald
headed
he
came
in
a
carriage
every
morning
and
went
straight
to
a
room
kept
from
us
by
opaque
glass
i
used
to
wonder
what
he
did
in
there
he
rarely
came
into
the
office
when
he
did
come
into
it
his
was
the
only
voice
which
ever
spoke
there
above
a
whisper
a
sharp
startling
and
minatory
voice
but
we
rarely
saw
him
there
a
bell
would
ring
a
sinister
summons
on
the
ceiling
over
the
desk
of
a
principal
clerk
and
that
chap
would
drop
anything
he
was
doing
anything
and
go
i
ve
seen
my
senior
clerk
an
elderly
man
in
spectacles
jump
as
if
he
d
been
struck
when
his
bell
whirred
it
was
such
an
awfully
solemn
place
nobody
ever
thought
of
calling
across
that
room
but
would
go
round
to
another
desk
and
whisper
you
felt
you
were
part
of
a
grave
and
secret
plot
scribbling
away
to
bring
it
to
a
completion
and
that
all
your
were
possible
traitors
but
the
plot
was
never
complete
it
went
on
and
on
day
after
day
in
an
everlasting
suffocating
sanctity
with
the
opaque
shining
glass
front
of
the
private
room
overlooking
us
a
luminous
face
entirely
blank
though
you
knew
the
brain
behind
it
saw
everything
and
was
aware
of
all
it
even
knew
old
beckwith
my
senior
had
got
deeply
into
debt
through
his
wife
s
doctor
s
bills
and
had
been
fool
enough
to
go
to
the
moneylenders
his
bell
sprang
a
summons
one
morning
in
beckwith
went
came
out
again
looking
grey
poor
old
perisher
went
straight
to
the
hat
rack
passed
awkwardly
through
the
swing
doors
letting
in
a
burst
of
traffic
noise
from
the
street
while
we
watched
him
furtively
and
that
was
the
last
of
beckwith
i
have
heard
our
boss
was
a
rigid
moralist
he
said
a
man
who
drank
gambled
or
got
into
debt
not
being
able
to
control
his
own
life
was
no
good
for
the
business
of
another
man
a
system
should
have
no
bowels
out
the
incompetent
had
to
go
it
was
spartan
but
it
paid
twenty
per
i
ve
heard
once
we
had
a
rebellious
interruption
of
our
sacred
quiet
but
only
once
i
never
knew
exactly
why
it
was
we
had
a
huge
factory
somewhere
in
the
east
town
one
afternoon
a
woman
came
to
the
counter
and
asked
for
the
cashier
she
was
so
obviously
east
end
in
a
shawl
that
the
counter
clerk
was
shocked
at
the
bare
idea
of
it
she
kept
demanding
the
cashier
the
clerk
politely
but
nervously
because
of
her
rising
emotional
voice
resisted
her
she
began
to
shout
we
all
stopped
to
see
what
would
happen
shouting
there
she
was
still
crying
wanted
justice
for
a
daughter
whose
body
had
got
into
a
machine
i
the
cashier
was
forced
to
appear
i
was
surprised
that
he
was
so
quiet
with
her
she
was
weeping
hysterically
at
our
polished
mahogany
counter
with
its
immaculate
blotters
and
flat
crystal
where
there
were
men
in
silk
hats
looking
at
the
unusual
scene
sideways
and
smiling
she
could
not
be
pacified
and
suddenly
she
picked
up
an
and
hurled
it
through
that
frozen
glass
face
of
the
private
room
a
devastating
crash
the
shocking
raucous
horror
of
blasphemy
the
silence
following
was
unendurable
we
looked
to
the
private
door
for
outraged
power
to
appear
nothing
happened
a
policeman
came
and
removed
the
woman
the
cashier
smiling
indulgently
at
the
officer
and
shaking
his
head
the
system
after
a
momentary
halt
moved
on
again
broad
serene
and
irresistible
i
never
catch
the
smell
of
an
open
bible
now
but
it
conjures
a
picture
of
that
arid
office
angular
polished
and
hard
where
the
ledgers
before
the
disciplined
men
exude
a
dusty
leathery
smell
but
there
i
stayed
for
years
smelling
it
and
making
out
bills
of
lading
and
invoices
it
was
my
lot
there
was
a
junior
who
assisted
me
a
chap
with
flat
shiny
hair
parted
in
the
middle
he
had
a
habit
of
whispering
about
girls
when
he
was
not
whispering
about
the
music
hall
last
night
or
the
football
next
saturday
when
the
cashier
a
young
man
and
a
relative
of
the
boss
came
walking
down
the
avenue
of
desks
his
sharp
eyes
narrowed
to
slits
and
his
mouth
a
little
open
it
was
funny
to
see
my
junior
put
on
speed
and
get
an
intent
and
earnest
look
in
his
face
when
i
was
done
for
the
day
i
d
get
my
book
out
of
my
bag
and
wonder
going
home
whether
i
d
ever
see
those
places
i
read
about
java
india
and
the
congo
where
you
went
about
in
a
white
helmet
and
a
white
uniform
and
did
things
in
a
large
directive
way
helping
indians
and
niggers
to
make
something
of
their
country
not
this
niggling
selfish
pretty
chandlery
written
large
in
stone
mahogany
and
glass
disguised
in
magnitude
and
gravity
cocoanut
palms
and
forests
with
untold
tales
but
like
the
boys
who
found
fun
with
the
girls
with
music
halls
and
football
but
were
afraid
of
the
sack
i
did
nothing
i
was
even
afraid
of
the
girls
one
day
as
usual
i
went
with
some
of
the
other
fellows
to
lunch
at
an
shop
we
always
went
there
the
girls
knew
us
and
would
smile
at
our
jokes
small
coffee
and
a
scone
and
butter
my
life
i
found
a
some
one
had
left
on
a
chair
and
i
read
it
more
because
i
didn
t
want
to
listen
to
that
virulent
abuse
of
our
mean
certainly
was
because
i
wanted
to
read
in
it
by
chance
i
noticed
an
advertisement
for
a
who
would
go
to
the
tropics
that
i
noted
of
course
i
stood
no
chance
but
i
could
try
that
night
at
home
i
wrote
an
application
i
wrote
it
i
think
a
dozen
times
till
the
letter
was
impeccable
a
thing
of
beauty
and
precision
i
felt
this
was
a
most
momentous
affair
whether
it
was
the
excitement
of
doing
something
in
the
veritable
direction
of
romance
or
whether
it
was
through
reading
waterman
s
wanderings
i
don
t
know
but
i
remember
a
curious
dream
i
had
that
night
i
was
alone
in
a
forest
which
made
me
afraid
and
expectant
it
was
still
and
secretive
you
know
the
empty
stage
in
an
unnatural
rosy
light
with
a
glorified
distance
in
which
you
expect
a
devil
or
a
fairy
queen
to
appear
there
was
a
hammock
hanging
motionless
from
a
branch
something
was
in
it
but
i
could
not
see
what
that
hammock
was
as
still
as
the
leaves
hanging
over
it
then
the
hammock
shook
and
a
girl
rose
in
it
and
smiled
at
me
she
was
tiny
but
adult
and
her
eyes
were
shining
in
the
dusk
of
her
hair
which
fell
thickly
over
her
little
breasts
a
telegram
came
for
me
just
as
i
was
leaving
for
the
office
one
morning
it
required
me
to
call
on
utah
brewster
at
the
hotel
palace
that
very
day
but
at
a
time
when
i
should
have
been
industriously
at
work
for
another
the
question
was
should
i
catch
that
morning
bus
i
had
never
take
all
the
possibilities
beyond
this
door
which
promised
to
open
on
romance
i
made
up
my
mind
which
went
drunk
with
rebellion
i
got
into
my
clothes
utah
brewster
and
freedom
the
blackwall
you
remember
those
old
hearses
with
a
straight
to
the
upper
deck
where
the
outside
passengers
sat
knees
up
back
to
back
along
the
middle
it
had
to
go
by
the
office
and
i
was
actually
in
doubt
whether
aware
of
my
unprecedented
revolt
it
would
stop
outside
the
familiar
glum
office
and
lawfully
refuse
to
budge
till
i
alighted
it
went
on
blundering
past
the
place
all
strangely
unconscious
of
what
it
was
doing
bearing
me
with
my
courage
screwed
down
to
the
driver
even
said
what
a
lovely
may
morning
it
was
the
hotel
palace
i
had
often
seen
that
ornate
building
when
saturday
afternoon
release
took
me
west
red
carpeting
on
the
steps
a
glimpse
of
ferns
women
all
as
strange
as
exotics
going
in
and
out
and
between
me
and
it
a
chasm
which
cut
clear
to
the
very
centre
of
the
earth
i
carried
my
attack
beyond
the
portals
it
was
nothing
after
all
a
flunkey
put
me
in
a
chair
too
full
of
cushions
to
be
easy
and
i
watched
men
and
women
who
at
that
time
of
the
day
when
all
the
folk
i
knew
were
making
desperate
and
cunning
efforts
to
keep
their
places
here
watched
those
men
and
women
behaving
as
though
all
eternity
were
theirs
and
it
was
the
angels
business
to
bear
them
up
it
was
as
great
a
mystery
to
me
whose
every
morning
was
the
inviolate
possession
of
another
as
joshua
s
solar
miracle
i
was
called
led
along
a
silent
corridor
full
of
shut
doors
and
after
a
long
walk
found
myself
beyond
all
the
noise
of
london
far
in
solitude
with
a
man
in
a
who
stood
before
a
fire
working
a
cigar
with
strong
mobile
lips
he
put
up
a
monocle
and
looked
at
me
shyly
then
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
talking
well
he
said
all
right
i
guess
you
ll
do
say
you
look
pretty
fit
you
don
t
drink
eh
don
t
get
nervous
when
you
see
the
dead
huh
all
he
put
his
monocle
back
into
his
eye
and
grinned
at
me
i
told
him
in
a
rush
how
much
i
wanted
to
see
the
tropics
he
said
nothing
he
got
a
large
blue
map
intricate
with
white
lines
and
told
me
of
the
company
the
job
i
did
not
fully
comprehend
it
then
i
don
t
now
he
left
out
too
much
there
was
no
beginning
and
no
ending
there
was
hardly
a
middle
he
merely
indicated
unrelated
points
but
at
any
rate
the
points
were
so
widely
sundered
and
so
different
that
the
bare
indication
of
them
conveyed
a
sense
of
an
enormous
undertaking
difficult
important
and
necessary
work
for
an
army
i
should
be
but
an
insignificant
sutler
in
that
army
but
at
least
i
should
be
one
in
it
one
of
those
putting
this
important
affair
through
for
future
generations
the
communal
idea
this
the
very
size
of
it
gave
me
a
sense
of
security
it
was
too
to
collapse
success
was
inherent
in
its
impersonal
nature
a
state
affair
brewster
briefly
mentioned
some
showy
names
names
of
great
financiers
they
were
my
generals
and
i
should
never
see
them
but
their
reputations
were
partly
in
my
keeping
hallelujah
i
had
escaped
i
never
went
back
to
the
office
i
never
replied
to
its
curt
inquiry
in
a
week
i
sailed
from
liverpool
much
i
heard
on
the
mail
boat
of
the
company
this
new
enterprise
which
was
going
to
make
a
tropical
region
one
of
the
richest
countries
in
the
world
develop
it
fling
its
riches
to
all
in
four
weeks
more
i
arrived
at
a
small
tropical
island
at
which
i
had
to
wait
for
the
company
s
tug
to
take
me
to
the
mainland
and
my
business
there
was
a
ashore
where
i
stayed
for
a
few
days
there
i
met
some
men
who
had
been
working
for
the
company
but
for
incomprehensible
reasons
were
leaving
this
work
to
which
i
had
come
so
eagerly
they
were
returning
home
they
were
strangely
pallid
and
limp
as
though
the
dark
of
some
hot
damp
underground
had
turned
their
blood
white
their
talk
was
drawled
out
the
weary
utterance
of
the
disillusioned
who
yet
showed
fate
no
resentment
they
might
have
been
the
dead
speaking
long
untouched
by
any
warm
human
vanity
i
was
really
glad
to
get
away
from
them
a
tug
conveyed
me
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
up
which
i
was
to
proceed
to
my
station
i
joined
a
river
steamer
the
river
that
gateway
to
my
dream
come
true
was
a
narrow
place
a
cleft
in
universal
trees
every
tree
the
same
mangroves
i
suppose
soon
the
forest
changed
often
rising
on
each
bank
to
meet
overhead
those
were
uncertain
places
of
leaves
and
dead
timber
and
as
quiet
and
still
as
churchyard
yews
at
midnight
the
thumps
of
our
did
not
sound
pleasant
deeper
and
deeper
we
went
making
turns
so
often
that
i
wondered
how
we
could
ever
be
got
out
again
sometimes
in
an
open
space
we
saw
a
flock
of
birds
i
saw
no
other
sign
of
life
there
were
no
men
all
my
were
ten
of
newcomers
some
from
the
states
some
from
germany
and
a
frenchman
i
was
the
only
englishman
each
of
us
knew
what
was
expected
of
himself
none
of
us
knew
what
that
was
which
all
would
be
doing
there
were
clerks
with
us
miners
civil
engineers
timber
men
and
a
metallurgist
we
speculated
much
were
perhaps
a
trifle
anxious
but
reposed
generally
on
the
great
idea
in
two
hundred
miles
we
reached
a
clearing
why
it
should
have
been
at
that
particular
place
did
not
show
but
there
it
was
the
tangible
link
in
an
invisible
encompassing
scheme
it
was
my
place
i
landed
with
my
box
there
was
a
white
man
on
the
river
bank
sitting
on
a
his
head
in
his
hands
he
looked
up
you
the
victim
he
said
well
there
you
are
a
lazy
arm
round
the
small
enclosed
that
s
your
job
there
s
your
store
there
s
your
house
that
s
where
the
niggers
pedro
he
called
a
native
in
shorts
and
a
wide
grass
hat
loafed
over
to
us
this
is
your
servant
he
said
he
s
a
bit
mad
but
he
s
not
a
fool
he
s
all
right
keep
your
eye
on
the
niggers
though
they
are
fools
and
they
re
not
mad
you
ll
find
the
inventory
and
the
accounts
in
the
desk
in
your
hut
the
quinine
s
there
too
take
these
keys
oh
the
mosquito
curtain
s
got
holes
in
it
see
you
mend
it
i
couldn
t
had
the
shakes
too
bad
cheer
up
he
went
aboard
the
steamer
saluted
me
with
its
whistle
turned
a
corner
and
the
sound
of
its
paddles
diminished
died
i
seemed
to
concentrate
as
though
i
had
never
known
myself
till
that
instant
when
the
sound
of
the
steamer
failed
when
the
last
connection
with
busy
outer
life
was
gone
i
could
smell
something
like
stephanotis
in
that
dead
silence
my
hearing
was
so
acute
that
i
caught
a
faint
rustling
which
i
thought
might
be
the
sound
of
things
growing
i
turned
and
went
to
my
hut
sad
pedro
following
with
my
box
the
cheap
american
clock
in
the
hut
made
a
terrific
noise
filling
the
afternoon
with
its
rapid
and
ridiculous
beat
trying
to
recall
to
me
that
time
still
was
moving
quickly
when
it
was
quite
evident
that
time
had
now
come
for
me
to
an
absolute
stand
in
a
noon
i
sat
surveying
things
from
a
chair
then
leisurely
took
my
envelope
and
read
my
i
was
to
receive
and
take
charge
of
shovels
lanterns
machinery
parts
railway
metals
soap
cooking
utensils
axes
pumps
and
so
on
which
consignments
i
must
divide
and
parcel
according
to
directions
to
come
marking
each
consignment
for
its
own
destination
the
names
of
a
hundred
destinations
i
should
hear
about
in
my
future
work
were
given
they
were
names
meaning
nothing
to
me
then
followed
some
brief
rules
for
a
novice
in
the
governing
of
men
through
all
the
rules
ran
an
incongruous
note
for
such
a
place
as
that
a
reminiscence
of
leadenhall
street
and
its
miserable
whine
yet
it
hardly
disturbed
me
i
sat
and
thought
over
this
expansion
of
my
life
a
melancholy
bird
called
in
two
notes
at
intervals
the
leaves
which
formed
the
thatch
of
my
hut
hung
a
long
coarse
black
fringe
at
the
door
my
walls
were
of
leaves
and
the
floor
a
raft
of
small
logs
still
with
the
bark
on
just
clear
of
the
ground
the
sunlight
came
through
one
dark
wall
studding
it
with
sparks
no
that
dubious
and
familiar
note
in
the
instructions
was
nothing
i
was
clear
beyond
all
that
those
occasions
for
carking
anxiety
which
deprave
the
worker
and
make
him
hate
the
task
to
which
whipping
necessity
drives
him
the
domineering
manner
of
my
instructions
the
fretfulness
of
the
old
correspondence
i
found
carelessly
scattered
about
addressed
to
my
predecessor
was
the
illusion
the
forest
behind
the
hut
the
black
river
the
quiet
the
insects
the
foreign
smell
the
puzzling
men
my
men
to
command
who
kept
passing
without
in
the
violent
light
they
were
not
from
books
any
more
they
made
evidence
direct
to
my
own
senses
now
i
was
authority
and
providence
moulding
and
protecting
as
i
thought
right
this
place
should
be
kept
reasonable
four
square
my
plot
of
earth
to
be
clean
and
unashamed
frankly
open
to
the
eye
of
the
sky
i
would
see
what
i
could
do
and
i
would
start
now
i
laughed
at
i
could
see
of
in
a
fragment
of
mirror
kept
to
a
door
tree
by
nail
heads
the
funny
hat
and
the
shirt
which
did
not
matter
bad
as
it
was
for
i
was
authority
there
by
every
reason
of
that
white
shirt
and
the
beard
which
was
coming
latitude
my
boy
latitude
i
strolled
out
to
survey
my
little
world
of
the
weeks
that
followed
nothing
comes
back
so
strongly
as
some
quite
irrelevant
incidents
a
tiger
i
saw
one
morning
swimming
the
river
pedro
insensible
for
two
days
with
fever
and
death
which
came
to
my
viceroy
authority
the
first
blow
there
was
a
flock
of
parrots
which
visited
us
one
day
and
it
surprised
me
that
the
men
should
regard
them
merely
as
food
but
there
was
work
to
be
done
and
in
a
definite
way
but
why
we
did
i
know
we
did
it
how
it
joined
up
with
the
job
i
could
not
see
that
was
not
my
affair
there
was
the
inventory
to
be
checked
for
one
thing
and
before
i
was
through
with
it
the
work
had
fairly
imprisoned
me
and
the
new
romantic
circumstances
became
blurred
and
over
written
that
inventory
was
so
extravagantly
wrong
that
in
a
week
i
was
going
about
heated
and
swearing
at
the
least
provocation
it
was
fraudulent
there
was
a
sporadic
disorder
of
goods
irreconcilable
with
their
neat
records
though
each
record
bore
the
signs
and
of
heaven
knows
how
many
departments
of
the
company
all
an
inextricable
welter
of
calm
errors
neatly
initialled
by
unknown
fools
every
few
days
a
steamer
of
the
company
would
call
loaded
with
more
goods
or
would
come
down
river
to
me
to
take
goods
away
the
confusion
grew
and
interpenetrated
till
i
felt
that
nothing
but
dumping
all
that
was
there
into
the
river
and
beginning
again
with
a
virgin
station
would
ever
clear
the
muddle
the
place
grew
maddening
through
ridiculous
blundering
from
outside
i
had
six
men
to
attend
to
all
with
temperatures
and
all
useless
the
arrears
of
accounts
my
work
on
sweltering
nights
while
the
very
niggers
slept
the
arrears
grew
a
came
without
its
shovel
and
not
all
my
written
protests
to
headquarters
could
complete
that
irrational
creature
lying
in
sections
rotting
in
sun
and
rain
minus
the
very
reason
for
its
existence
an
impediment
to
us
and
an
irritation
constant
urgent
orders
came
to
me
from
up
country
to
ship
there
this
abortion
i
declined
in
the
name
of
sanity
there
followed
peremptory
demands
for
a
complete
violent
with
animosity
for
me
the
unknown
idiot
who
obstinately
refused
to
let
a
go
just
as
though
i
was
in
love
with
the
damned
thing
and
could
not
part
with
it
but
i
understood
those
letters
they
were
from
chaps
irritated
like
myself
by
all
this
awful
tomfoolery
and
from
headquarters
came
other
letters
shot
with
a
curt
note
of
innocent
insolence
asking
whether
i
was
asleep
there
or
dead
and
adding
once
that
if
i
could
not
keep
up
communications
better
i
had
better
make
way
for
one
who
could
there
were
plenty
who
could
do
it
pleasant
wasn
t
it
they
complained
querulously
of
my
accounts
almost
insinuating
that
i
debited
more
wages
to
the
company
than
i
credited
to
the
men
i
had
too
many
sick
men
they
said
did
i
pamper
them
and
again
i
had
too
many
who
died
i
must
take
care
they
did
not
want
the
local
government
to
get
alarmed
the
time
came
when
i
got
amusement
out
of
those
letters
from
headquarters
for
their
faults
were
so
plain
that
i
conceived
the
headquarters
staff
having
much
time
to
spend
and
a
sort
of
instruction
at
large
to
administer
ginger
to
men
like
myself
on
the
spot
on
general
principles
so
to
keep
us
not
only
alive
but
brisk
and
anxious
and
doing
it
with
the
inconsequential
abandon
of
little
children
playing
with
sharp
knives
i
got
comfort
from
that
view
and
when
i
looked
round
my
placid
domain
where
my
men
with
whom
i
was
on
good
terms
laboured
easily
and
rightly
under
the
still
woods
i
told
myself
i
was
still
fretting
because
the
business
was
new
that
things
would
come
easier
soon
but
at
night
i
felt
i
was
anxious
exactly
because
it
was
all
so
old
and
familiar
to
me
one
day
having
given
a
group
of
men
at
work
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
clearing
some
advice
i
noticed
a
little
path
enter
the
wood
beside
a
big
tree
i
had
never
been
into
the
forest
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
had
no
time
the
trees
stood
round
us
keeping
us
i
had
always
felt
a
little
doubt
of
what
was
there
and
could
not
be
seen
i
turned
inwards
i
found
myself
at
once
in
a
cool
gloom
i
went
on
curiously
peering
each
side
into
those
shadows
where
nothing
moved
and
in
an
hour
came
to
another
clearing
smaller
than
my
own
and
with
no
river
in
view
by
the
sun
which
now
i
saw
again
this
place
was
north
of
our
station
the
opening
was
being
rapidly
choked
by
a
new
growth
i
was
turning
for
home
again
for
the
afternoon
was
late
when
i
saw
a
hammock
slung
between
two
saplings
beside
a
dismantled
hut
i
could
just
see
the
hammock
and
hut
through
the
scrub
i
went
over
there
and
was
so
carefully
looking
for
snakes
and
beastly
things
in
the
bush
that
i
had
arrived
before
i
knew
it
the
hut
had
been
long
abandoned
the
hammock
had
something
in
it
and
i
was
turning
something
in
my
mind
as
i
went
up
to
it
there
were
some
ragged
clothes
in
the
bottom
of
it
partly
covering
bones
and
among
the
rags
was
a
globe
of
black
hair
next
morning
i
woke
late
feeling
i
had
gone
wrong
my
hands
were
yellow
and
my
finger
nails
blue
and
i
was
shaking
with
cold
but
the
tootling
of
an
steamer
forced
me
to
business
the
steamer
was
towing
six
lighters
filled
with
labourers
they
were
poles
i
think
afterwards
i
learned
some
hundreds
of
these
men
had
been
collected
for
us
somewhere
by
a
clever
recruiting
agent
who
promised
each
poor
wretch
a
profitable
time
in
the
garden
of
eden
my
responsibility
thirty
of
them
was
landed
they
stood
by
the
river
gaping
about
them
wondering
some
alarmed
more
of
them
angry
most
clad
in
stuffy
woollens
poor
souls
having
the
fever
i
was
not
very
interested
i
told
my
negro
foreman
to
find
them
shelter
and
to
put
them
to
work
we
were
making
our
clearing
larger
and
were
building
more
something
like
the
pale
morning
light
which
wakens
you
weary
from
a
fitful
sleep
to
the
clear
apprehension
again
of
an
urgent
trouble
which
has
filled
the
night
with
dreams
i
came
through
each
bout
of
fever
to
know
there
was
really
trouble
outside
with
the
new
men
daily
i
had
to
crawl
about
shivering
my
head
dizzy
with
quinine
till
the
fever
came
near
its
height
when
i
got
into
my
hammock
and
would
lie
there
waiting
burning
and
dry
tremulous
with
an
anxiety
i
could
not
shape
sometimes
then
i
saw
my
big
negro
foreman
come
to
the
door
look
at
me
as
though
wishing
to
say
something
but
leave
reluctantly
when
i
motioned
him
away
one
morning
i
was
better
but
hardly
able
to
walk
when
shouts
and
a
running
fight
which
i
could
see
through
the
door
showed
me
the
poles
had
mutinied
there
was
a
hustling
gang
of
them
outside
my
door
filling
it
with
haggard
furious
faces
i
could
not
understand
them
but
one
presently
began
to
shout
in
french
they
refused
to
work
the
food
was
bad
they
wanted
meat
they
wanted
their
contracts
fulfilled
they
wanted
bread
clothes
money
passages
out
of
the
country
they
had
been
fooled
and
swindled
they
were
dying
i
argued
plaintively
with
that
man
but
it
made
him
shout
and
gesticulate
at
that
the
voices
of
all
rose
in
a
passionate
tumult
knives
and
axes
flourishing
in
the
sunlight
in
a
sudden
cold
ferocity
not
knowing
what
i
was
doing
i
picked
up
my
empty
had
no
moved
down
on
them
they
held
for
a
moment
then
broke
ground
and
walked
away
quickly
looking
back
with
fear
and
malice
next
day
they
had
gone
yes
actually
the
poor
devils
they
had
gone
with
the
exception
of
a
few
with
the
fever
they
had
taken
to
that
darkness
around
us
to
find
a
way
to
the
coast
talk
of
the
babes
in
the
wood
the
men
had
no
food
no
guide
and
had
they
known
the
right
direction
they
could
not
have
followed
it
if
the
company
did
not
take
you
out
of
that
land
you
stayed
there
and
if
the
company
did
not
feed
you
there
you
died
no
creature
could
leave
that
clearing
and
survive
unless
i
willed
it
the
forest
and
the
river
kept
my
men
together
as
effectively
as
though
they
were
marooned
without
a
boat
on
a
island
those
men
were
never
heard
of
again
nobody
was
to
blame
whom
could
you
blame
the
company
did
not
desire
their
death
simply
not
knowing
what
they
were
doing
those
poor
fellows
walked
into
the
invisibly
moving
machinery
of
the
job
not
knowing
it
was
there
and
were
mutilated
we
had
news
of
the
same
trouble
with
the
poles
up
river
some
of
the
mutineers
tried
to
get
to
the
sea
on
rafts
such
amazing
courage
was
but
desperation
and
a
complete
ignorance
of
the
place
they
were
in
one
such
raft
did
pass
our
place
some
of
them
were
prone
on
it
others
squatting
one
man
got
on
his
feet
as
the
raft
swung
by
our
clearing
and
emptied
his
revolver
into
us
a
few
days
later
another
raft
floated
by
close
in
with
six
men
lying
upon
it
they
were
headless
somewhere
the
savages
had
caught
them
asleep
no
i
was
not
affected
as
much
as
you
might
think
i
began
to
look
upon
it
all
with
insensitive
serenity
i
was
getting
like
the
men
i
met
on
the
islands
months
before
i
saw
us
all
caught
by
something
huge
and
hungry
a
viewless
impartial
appetite
which
swallowed
us
all
without
examination
which
was
slowly
eating
me
i
began
to
feel
i
should
never
leave
that
place
and
did
not
care
why
should
others
want
to
leave
it
then
often
through
weakness
the
trees
around
us
seemed
to
me
to
sway
to
be
veiled
in
a
thin
mist
the
heat
did
not
weigh
on
my
skin
but
on
my
dry
bones
i
was
parched
body
and
mind
and
when
the
men
came
with
their
grievances
i
felt
i
could
shoot
any
of
them
for
very
weariness
to
escape
argument
the
insolence
from
headquarters
i
filed
for
reference
no
longer
but
lit
my
pipe
with
it
but
the
correspondence
ceased
at
length
and
because
now
i
was
callous
to
it
i
failed
to
notice
it
had
stopped
some
vessels
passed
down
river
coming
suddenly
to
view
a
rush
of
paddles
and
were
gone
tootling
their
whistles
the
work
went
on
mechanically
the
clearing
grew
the
sheds
spread
one
by
one
the
inventory
was
kept
the
accounts
were
dealt
with
there
came
a
time
when
i
was
forced
to
remember
that
the
steamer
had
not
called
for
ten
days
we
were
running
short
of
food
i
had
a
number
of
sick
but
no
quinine
the
men
those
quick
faithful
fellows
with
the
patient
eyes
they
looked
to
me
and
i
was
going
to
fail
them
i
made
pills
of
flour
to
look
like
quinine
for
the
fever
patients
trying
to
cure
them
by
faith
i
wrote
a
report
to
headquarters
which
i
knew
would
get
me
my
discharge
i
was
not
polite
there
was
no
meat
we
tried
dough
fried
in
lard
when
i
think
of
the
dumb
patience
of
those
black
fellows
in
their
endurance
for
an
idea
of
which
they
knew
nothing
i
am
amazed
at
the
docility
and
kindness
inherent
in
common
men
they
will
give
their
lives
for
nothing
if
you
don
t
tell
them
to
do
it
but
only
let
them
trust
you
to
take
them
to
the
sacrifice
they
know
nothing
about
that
went
on
for
a
month
we
were
in
rags
we
were
starved
we
were
scarecrows
no
steamer
had
been
by
the
place
from
either
direction
for
a
month
then
a
vessel
came
i
did
not
know
the
chap
in
charge
he
seemed
surprised
to
see
us
there
he
opened
his
eyes
at
our
gaunt
crew
of
survivors
shocked
then
he
spoke
don
t
you
know
he
asked
even
that
ridiculous
question
had
no
effect
on
me
i
merely
eyed
him
i
was
reduced
to
an
impotent
dumb
query
i
suppose
i
was
like
jack
the
foreman
a
gaping
silent
pathetic
interrogation
at
last
i
spoke
and
my
voice
sounded
miles
away
well
what
do
you
want
here
i
ve
come
for
that
steam
shovel
i
ve
bought
the
man
was
mad
my
sick
men
wanted
physic
we
all
wanted
food
but
this
stranger
had
come
to
us
just
to
take
away
our
useless
steam
shovel
i
thought
you
knew
he
said
the
company
s
bought
out
some
syndicate
s
bought
em
out
a
month
ago
thought
the
company
would
be
too
successful
spoil
some
other
place
there
s
no
company
now
they
re
selling
off
what
about
that
steam
shovel
v
we
had
tons
of
cargo
and
nearly
all
of
it
was
patent
fuel
this
was
to
be
put
into
baskets
hauled
up
and
emptied
into
railway
trucks
run
out
on
the
jetty
alongside
we
watched
the
men
at
work
for
a
few
days
and
nights
and
judged
we
should
be
at
porto
velho
for
a
month
i
saw
for
myself
long
rambles
in
the
forest
during
that
time
of
golden
leisure
but
saw
them
no
more
after
the
first
attempt
the
clearing
on
its
north
side
rose
steeply
to
about
a
hundred
feet
on
the
hard
red
conglomerate
to
the
south
on
the
san
antonio
side
it
ended
in
a
creek
and
a
swamp
but
at
whatever
point
the
doctor
and
i
attempted
to
leave
the
clearing
we
soon
found
ourselves
stopped
by
a
dense
undergrowth
at
a
few
places
there
were
narrow
footpaths
subterranean
in
the
quality
of
their
light
made
by
timbermen
when
searching
for
suitable
trees
for
the
these
tracks
never
penetrated
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
and
always
ended
in
a
well
of
sunshine
in
the
forest
where
some
big
trees
would
be
prone
in
a
tangle
of
splintered
branches
and
a
deep
litter
of
leaves
and
broken
fronds
and
that
was
as
far
as
man
had
got
inwards
from
the
east
bank
of
the
madeira
river
beyond
it
was
the
undiscovered
and
the
araras
indians
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
difficulty
was
the
same
the
rio
purus
the
next
tributary
of
the
amazon
westward
from
the
madeira
had
its
course
it
was
guessed
perhaps
not
more
than
fifty
miles
across
country
from
the
river
bank
opposite
porto
velho
but
no
one
yet
has
made
a
traverse
of
the
land
between
the
two
streams
the
dark
secrecy
of
the
region
was
even
oppressive
sometimes
when
venturing
alone
a
little
beyond
a
footpath
out
of
hearing
of
the
settlement
surrounded
by
the
dim
tangle
in
which
there
was
not
a
movement
or
a
sound
i
have
become
suspicious
that
the
shapes
about
me
in
the
half
light
were
all
that
was
real
there
and
porto
velho
and
its
men
an
illusion
and
there
has
been
a
touch
of
panic
in
my
haste
to
find
the
trail
again
and
to
prove
that
it
could
take
me
to
an
open
prospect
of
sunny
things
with
the
solid
capella
in
their
midst
we
carried
our
butterfly
nets
ashore
and
went
of
a
morning
across
the
settlement
choosing
one
of
the
paths
which
ended
in
a
small
forest
opening
where
there
was
sunlight
as
well
as
shadow
few
butterflies
came
to
such
places
you
could
really
think
the
forest
was
untenanted
a
tanager
would
dart
a
ray
of
metallic
sheen
in
the
wreckage
of
timber
and
dead
branches
about
us
or
some
creature
would
call
briefly
melancholy
wise
in
the
woods
very
rarely
an
animal
would
go
with
an
explosive
rush
through
the
leaves
but
movements
and
sounds
except
the
sound
of
our
own
voices
were
surprises
and
a
sight
of
one
of
the
larger
inhabitants
of
the
jungle
is
such
a
rarity
that
we
knew
we
might
be
there
for
years
and
never
get
it
yet
life
about
its
various
business
in
the
woods
kept
us
interested
till
the
declining
sun
said
it
was
time
to
get
aboard
again
every
foot
of
earth
the
rotting
wood
the
bark
of
the
standing
trees
every
pool
and
the
litter
of
dead
leaves
and
husks
were
populous
when
closely
regarded
most
of
the
trees
had
smooth
barks
a
corrugated
trunk
like
that
of
our
elm
was
exceptional
but
when
a
bole
had
a
rough
surface
it
would
be
masked
by
the
grey
tenacious
webbing
of
spiders
on
one
such
tree
we
found
a
small
mantis
which
so
mimicked
the
spiders
that
we
were
long
in
discovering
what
it
really
was
many
of
the
smooth
tree
trunks
were
striated
laterally
with
lines
of
dry
mud
these
lines
were
actually
tunnels
covered
ways
for
certain
ants
the
corridors
of
this
limitless
mansion
had
many
such
surprises
there
were
the
sauba
ants
they
might
engross
all
a
man
s
hours
for
in
watching
them
he
could
easily
forget
there
were
other
things
in
the
world
they
would
move
over
the
ground
in
an
interminable
procession
looked
at
quickly
that
column
of
fluid
life
seemed
a
narrow
brook
its
surface
smothered
with
green
leaves
which
it
carried
not
round
or
under
obstructions
but
upwards
and
over
them
nearly
every
tiny
creature
in
that
stream
of
life
held
upright
in
its
jaws
a
banner
much
larger
than
itself
cut
from
a
fresh
leaf
it
bore
its
banner
along
hurriedly
and
resolutely
all
the
ants
carrying
leaves
moved
in
one
direction
the
flickering
and
forward
movement
of
so
many
leaves
gave
the
procession
of
ants
the
wavering
appearance
of
shallow
water
running
unevenly
on
both
sides
of
the
column
other
ants
hurried
in
the
reverse
direction
often
stopping
to
communicate
something
with
their
antennæ
to
their
burdened
fellows
two
ants
would
stop
momentarily
and
there
would
be
a
swift
intimation
and
then
away
they
would
go
again
on
their
urgent
affairs
we
would
see
rapid
conversations
of
that
kind
everywhere
in
the
host
other
ants
with
larger
heads
kept
moving
hither
and
thither
about
the
main
body
having
an
eye
on
matters
generally
i
suppose
policing
or
superintending
them
there
was
no
doubt
all
those
little
fellows
had
a
common
purpose
there
was
no
doubt
they
had
made
up
their
minds
about
it
long
since
had
come
to
a
decision
communally
and
that
each
of
them
knew
his
job
and
meant
to
get
it
done
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
ant
favoured
by
the
god
of
the
ants
you
have
to
cut
your
own
leaf
and
get
along
with
it
if
you
are
a
sauba
there
they
were
flowing
at
our
feet
i
see
it
now
one
of
those
restricted
forest
openings
to
which
we
often
went
the
wall
of
the
jungle
all
round
and
some
small
attalea
palms
left
standing
the
green
of
their
long
plumes
as
hard
and
bright
as
though
varnished
nothing
else
is
there
that
is
green
except
the
weeds
which
came
when
the
sunlight
was
let
in
by
the
axe
the
spindly
forest
columns
rise
about
pallid
in
a
wall
of
gloom
draped
with
withered
stuff
and
dead
cordage
their
far
foliage
is
black
and
undistinguishable
against
the
irregular
patch
of
overhead
blue
it
never
ceased
to
be
remarkable
that
so
little
that
was
green
was
there
the
few
pothos
plants
their
shapely
parasitic
foliage
sitting
like
decorative
nests
in
some
boughs
to
the
sky
would
be
strangely
conspicuous
and
bright
the
only
leaves
of
the
forest
near
us
were
on
the
ground
brown
parchments
all
of
one
simple
shape
that
of
the
leaf
of
the
laurel
i
remember
a
stagnant
pool
there
and
over
it
suspended
some
enamelled
dragonflies
their
wings
vibrating
so
rapidly
that
the
flies
were
like
rubies
shining
in
obscure
nebulæ
when
we
moved
the
nymphs
vanished
just
as
if
a
light
flashed
out
we
sat
down
again
on
our
felled
tree
to
watch
and
magically
they
reappeared
in
the
same
place
as
though
their
apparition
depended
on
the
angle
and
distance
of
the
eye
when
a
bird
called
one
started
involuntarily
for
the
air
was
so
muffled
and
heavy
that
it
was
strange
to
find
it
open
instantly
to
let
free
the
delicate
sibilation
in
the
low
ground
beyond
porto
velho
up
stream
there
was
another
place
in
the
forest
where
sometimes
we
would
go
the
approach
to
it
being
through
a
deep
cutting
made
by
the
railwaymen
in
the
clay
this
clay
a
stiff
homogeneous
mass
mottled
rose
and
white
was
saturated
with
moisture
and
the
helicon
butterflies
frequented
it
probably
because
it
was
damp
and
a
sight
of
their
black
and
yellow
or
black
and
crimson
wings
spread
on
the
clean
plane
of
the
beautifully
tinted
rock
was
far
better
than
putting
them
in
the
collecting
box
the
helicons
are
bold
insects
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
our
close
inspecting
eyes
beyond
the
cutting
was
a
long
narrow
clearing
with
a
giant
silk
cotton
tree
a
province
in
itself
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
looking
straight
upward
we
could
see
its
foliage
but
so
far
away
was
the
spreading
canopy
of
leaves
that
it
was
only
a
black
cloud
the
outermost
sprays
mere
wisps
of
dark
vapour
melting
in
the
intense
brightness
of
the
sky
the
smooth
grey
trunk
was
heavily
buttressed
the
sapeomas
literally
flat
roots
ascending
the
bole
for
more
than
fifty
feet
and
radiating
in
walls
about
the
base
of
the
tree
the
compartments
were
so
large
that
they
could
have
been
used
as
stabling
for
four
or
five
horses
from
its
upper
limbs
a
wreckage
of
lianas
hung
to
the
ground
beyond
this
giant
the
path
rose
to
a
place
where
the
clearing
was
already
waist
high
with
scrub
then
it
descended
again
to
the
woods
but
the
woods
there
were
flooded
that
was
my
first
near
view
of
the
igapo
we
had
approached
the
trees
for
they
seemed
free
of
the
usual
undergrowth
and
passed
into
the
sombre
colonnades
the
way
appeared
clear
enough
and
we
thought
we
could
move
ahead
freely
at
last
but
found
in
a
few
steps
the
bare
floor
was
really
black
water
the
base
of
the
forest
was
submerged
the
columns
which
supported
the
unseen
roof
through
which
came
little
light
diminished
down
soundless
distance
into
night
after
the
flaming
day
from
which
we
had
just
come
this
darkness
was
repellant
the
forest
that
austere
stately
and
regarding
presence
draped
interminably
in
verdant
folds
while
we
gazed
upon
it
suspecting
no
new
thing
of
it
as
by
a
stealthy
movement
had
withdrawn
its
green
robe
and
our
sight
had
fallen
into
the
cavernous
gloom
of
its
dank
and
hollow
heart
it
was
about
the
little
wooden
town
itself
where
the
scarified
earth
was
already
sparsely
mantled
with
shrubs
flowering
vines
and
weeds
and
where
the
burnt
tree
stumps
and
even
the
door
posts
in
some
cases
were
freshly
insurgent
beaten
down
by
fire
and
sword
but
never
to
its
source
and
copious
most
of
the
butterflies
were
to
be
found
in
a
land
where
blossoms
were
few
these
were
the
winged
flowers
about
the
squalid
wooden
barracks
of
the
negro
and
native
labourers
which
were
built
off
the
ground
to
allow
of
ventilation
and
had
a
trench
round
them
foul
with
drainage
and
evil
with
smells
a
colœnis
a
scarlet
butterfly
with
narrow
wings
used
to
flash
and
frequently
would
settle
there
over
the
flowering
weeds
on
the
waste
ground
there
would
be
in
the
morning
hours
or
when
the
sky
was
overcast
glittering
clouds
of
the
smaller
and
duller
species
though
among
them
now
and
then
would
stoop
a
very
emperor
of
butterflies
a
being
quick
and
unbelievably
beautiful
to
temperate
eyes
after
midday
when
the
sun
was
intense
the
butterflies
became
scarce
when
out
of
the
shade
of
the
woods
and
stranded
at
that
time
in
the
hopeless
heat
of
the
bare
settlement
we
could
turn
into
one
of
the
houses
of
the
officials
of
the
company
for
shelter
these
also
were
of
timber
cool
with
a
verandah
that
was
a
cage
of
fine
copper
gauze
to
keep
out
the
insects
all
the
doors
were
the
fewest
chances
were
offered
to
the
mosquitoes
there
was
no
glass
for
the
window
openings
also
were
covered
with
copper
mesh
here
we
could
sit
in
shaded
security
in
lazy
chairs
and
look
out
over
the
clearing
to
the
river
below
and
to
the
level
line
of
forest
across
the
river
while
listening
to
stories
which
had
come
down
to
porto
velho
from
the
interior
brought
by
the
returning
pioneers
porto
velho
had
a
population
of
about
three
hundred
there
were
americans
germans
english
brazilians
a
few
frenchmen
portuguese
some
spaniards
and
a
crowd
of
negroes
and
negresses
there
was
but
one
white
woman
in
the
settlement
i
was
told
the
climate
seemed
to
poison
them
the
white
girl
who
persisted
in
staying
in
spite
of
warnings
from
the
doctors
was
herself
a
brazilian
the
wife
of
one
of
the
labourers
she
refused
to
leave
and
sometimes
i
saw
her
about
petite
frail
looking
very
sad
but
her
husband
was
earning
good
money
it
was
a
busy
place
most
of
it
being
workshops
stores
and
offices
with
an
engine
and
trucks
jangling
inconsequentially
on
the
track
by
the
shore
the
line
crossed
a
creek
by
a
trestle
bridge
and
disappeared
in
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
san
antonio
the
hospital
for
the
men
was
nearly
two
miles
up
the
track
it
was
along
the
railway
track
towards
the
hospital
with
the
woods
to
the
left
and
a
short
margin
of
scrub
and
forest
and
then
the
river
on
the
right
hand
that
i
saw
one
morning
in
sauntering
a
few
miles
as
many
butterflies
as
there
are
flowers
in
an
english
garden
in
june
they
were
the
blossoms
of
the
place
the
track
was
bright
with
them
they
settled
on
the
hot
metals
and
ties
clustered
thickly
round
muddy
pools
a
plantation
there
as
vivid
and
alive
in
the
quick
movements
of
their
wings
as
though
a
wind
shook
the
petals
of
a
bed
of
flowers
they
flashed
by
like
birds
one
would
soar
slowly
wings
outspread
and
stable
a
living
plane
of
metallic
green
and
black
there
was
a
large
and
insolent
did
not
move
from
his
drink
at
a
puddle
though
my
boot
almost
touched
wings
a
velvety
black
with
crimson
eyes
on
the
underwings
and
i
caught
him
but
i
was
so
astonished
by
the
strength
of
his
convulsive
body
in
the
net
that
i
let
him
go
near
the
hospital
some
bushes
were
covered
with
minute
flowers
and
seen
from
a
distance
the
countless
insects
moving
about
those
bushes
were
a
glistening
and
puzzling
haze
all
that
morning
i
had
felt
the
power
of
the
torrid
sun
which
clung
to
the
body
like
invisible
bonds
and
made
one
s
movements
slow
was
a
luscious
benefit
a
golden
bath
a
softening
and
generative
balm
a
mother
heat
and
light
whose
ardent
virtues
stained
pinions
crimson
and
cobalt
and
made
bodies
strong
and
convulsive
and
caused
the
earth
to
burst
with
rushing
sap
to
send
up
green
fountains
for
so
the
palms
which
showed
everywhere
in
the
woods
looked
to
me
you
could
hear
the
incessant
low
murmur
of
multitudinous
wings
and
i
had
been
warned
to
beware
of
all
things
i
felt
instead
that
i
could
live
and
grow
for
ever
in
such
a
land
presently
becoming
a
little
weary
of
so
much
strong
light
i
found
it
was
midday
and
looking
back
there
was
the
ship
across
a
curve
of
the
river
it
was
two
good
miles
away
two
intense
shadeless
silent
afternoon
miles
i
began
the
return
journey
an
increasing
rumbling
sound
ahead
made
me
look
up
as
i
stepped
from
tie
to
tie
and
there
came
at
me
a
trolley
car
pumped
along
slowly
four
brown
bodies
rising
and
falling
rhythmically
over
its
handle
a
man
in
a
white
suit
was
its
passenger
as
it
passed
me
i
saw
it
bore
also
something
under
a
white
cloth
the
cloth
moulded
a
childish
figure
of
which
only
the
hem
of
a
skirt
and
the
neat
little
booted
feet
showed
beyond
the
cloth
and
the
feet
swayed
limply
with
the
jolts
of
the
car
in
a
way
curiously
appealing
and
woful
the
car
stopped
and
the
white
man
a
cheerful
young
doctor
chewing
an
extinct
cigar
came
to
me
for
a
light
he
stood
to
gossip
for
a
few
minutes
giving
his
men
a
rest
that
s
the
brazilian
girl
he
said
she
wouldn
t
go
home
when
told
poor
this
madeira
river
had
the
look
of
very
adventurous
fishing
and
the
doctor
had
brought
with
him
an
assortment
of
tackle
the
water
was
opaque
and
it
was
deep
its
prospects
though
the
forest
closed
round
us
were
spacious
it
flowed
silently
with
great
power
and
its
surface
was
often
coiled
by
profound
movements
the
coils
of
the
river
as
we
were
looking
over
the
side
one
morning
began
to
move
in
our
minds
also
and
the
doctor
mentioned
his
tackle
there
was
the
forest
enclosing
us
as
mute
as
the
water
its
bare
roots
clenched
in
aqueous
earth
nobody
could
tell
us
much
about
the
fish
in
this
river
but
we
heard
stories
of
creatures
partly
seen
there
was
one
story
of
a
thing
taken
from
the
very
place
in
the
river
where
we
were
anchored
a
fish
in
armour
which
the
natives
declared
was
new
to
them
a
fearful
ganoid
i
guessed
it
reconstructing
it
in
vision
from
fragments
of
various
tales
about
it
such
as
is
pictured
in
a
book
on
primeval
rocks
there
were
alligators
too
and
there
was
the
sucuruju
which
i
could
call
the
great
water
serpent
only
the
indian
name
sounds
so
much
more
right
and
awful
and
that
fellow
is
forty
feet
long
in
his
legend
but
spoils
a
good
story
through
reducing
himself
by
half
when
he
is
actually
killed
still
twenty
feet
of
stout
snake
is
enough
for
trouble
i
saw
one
just
after
it
was
killed
which
was
feet
in
length
and
was
three
feet
round
its
middle
so
to
fish
in
the
madeira
was
as
if
one
s
hook
and
line
were
cast
into
the
deeps
where
forms
that
are
without
name
stir
in
the
dark
of
dreams
we
got
out
our
tackle
and
the
cook
had
an
assortment
of
stuff
he
did
not
want
and
that
we
put
on
the
hooks
and
waited
our
lines
carried
astern
by
the
current
for
signals
from
the
unknown
yet
excepting
for
a
few
catfish
nothing
interrupted
the
placid
flow
of
stream
and
time
the
doctor
put
a
bight
of
the
lime
round
his
wrist
sat
down
and
slept
we
had
fine
afternoons
broad
with
the
wealth
of
our
own
time
old
man
jim
came
aboard
and
saw
our
patience
with
amusement
he
suggested
dynamite
and
no
waiting
the
river
was
full
of
good
fish
and
he
would
come
next
day
with
a
canoe
and
take
us
where
we
could
get
a
load
it
was
a
suggestion
which
needed
slurring
to
look
attractive
to
sportsmen
jim
took
it
for
granted
that
we
simply
wanted
fish
to
eat
and
as
many
as
we
could
get
and
next
morning
there
he
was
alongside
with
his
big
boat
and
its
crew
jim
himself
was
in
the
stern
the
navigator
and
he
was
sitting
on
what
i
was
told
was
a
box
of
dynamite
now
there
were
two
others
of
our
company
who
but
the
day
before
were
even
eager
to
see
what
dynamite
would
send
up
from
the
bottom
of
that
river
but
when
they
saw
the
craft
alongside
with
its
crew
and
jim
with
his
rifle
sitting
on
a
power
which
could
lift
paul
s
they
considered
everything
and
decided
they
could
not
go
that
day
i
went
alone
i
suppose
men
do
plucky
things
because
they
are
largely
thoughtless
of
the
danger
of
the
things
they
do
as
soon
as
i
was
sitting
on
the
level
of
the
water
in
that
crazy
boat
with
jim
and
his
explosive
and
beside
him
what
whisky
he
had
not
already
consumed
and
saw
under
my
nose
the
eddies
and
upheavals
of
the
current
i
knew
i
was
doing
a
very
plucky
thing
indeed
and
wished
i
was
high
and
safe
on
the
but
we
had
pushed
off
jim
with
his
eyes
dreamy
through
barley
juice
was
the
pilot
and
there
was
a
measure
of
confidence
to
be
got
from
the
way
he
navigated
us
past
the
charging
trees
afloat
there
was
no
drink
in
the
steering
paddle
at
least
but
the
shore
was
a
long
swim
away
yet
perhaps
it
would
have
been
as
pleasant
to
be
drowned
or
as
to
be
lost
in
the
jungle
we
turned
into
a
still
creek
where
the
trees
met
overhead
jim
continued
his
course
till
the
inundated
forest
was
about
us
the
gloom
was
hollow
the
pillars
rising
from
the
black
floor
were
spectral
and
our
voices
and
paddles
sounded
like
a
noisy
irruption
among
the
aisles
of
a
temple
the
echoes
fled
from
us
deeper
into
the
dark
but
jim
was
all
unconscious
of
this
he
but
stopped
our
progress
and
opened
the
box
of
cartridges
i
had
never
seen
dynamite
but
only
heard
of
it
i
understood
it
had
unexpected
qualities
jim
had
a
cartridge
in
his
hand
and
was
digging
a
knife
into
it
i
repeat
the
flooded
wilderness
was
round
us
and
below
was
the
black
deep
jim
fitted
a
detonator
to
a
length
of
fuse
and
stuck
it
in
the
cartridge
he
was
in
no
hurry
he
stopped
now
and
then
for
another
drink
having
got
the
cartridge
ready
with
its
potent
filament
he
tied
four
more
cartridges
round
it
i
put
these
things
down
simply
but
my
hand
ached
with
the
way
i
gripped
the
gunwale
and
i
could
hear
myself
breathing
then
jim
struck
a
match
on
his
breeches
with
all
the
fumbling
deliberation
of
the
fully
the
vine
leaves
from
his
eyes
the
better
to
see
what
he
was
he
lit
the
fuse
after
it
had
twice
dodged
the
match
it
fizzed
the
splutter
worked
downwards
energetically
jim
did
not
deign
to
look
at
it
though
it
fascinated
me
he
slowly
scratched
his
back
with
his
disengaged
hand
and
gazed
absently
into
the
forest
the
spark
and
its
spurts
of
smoke
were
now
near
the
bottom
jim
changed
the
menace
into
his
right
hand
in
order
to
reach
another
part
of
his
back
with
his
leisurely
left
his
eyes
were
still
on
the
forest
i
kept
swallowing
jim
i
said
i
did
not
know
i
was
going
to
don
t
you
think
you
d
better
throw
it
away
now
he
regarded
me
steadily
with
eyes
half
shut
the
spark
spurted
and
dropped
another
inch
he
looked
at
it
he
looked
round
the
waters
without
haste
then
and
i
could
have
cried
aloud
he
threw
the
shocking
handful
away
from
us
it
sank
there
were
a
few
bubbles
and
we
sat
regarding
each
other
in
the
quiet
of
a
time
which
had
been
long
dead
waiting
for
something
to
happen
in
a
time
to
come
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
the
bottom
of
the
river
fell
out
with
the
noise
of
the
collapse
of
an
iron
foundry
on
a
sunday
our
boat
tried
to
leap
upwards
but
failed
the
water
did
not
burst
asunder
it
vibrated
and
was
then
convulsed
dead
fish
appeared
everywhere
patches
of
white
all
round
but
we
hardly
saw
them
there
was
a
great
head
which
emerged
from
the
floor
looking
upwards
sleepily
and
two
hands
moved
slowly
these
quietly
sank
again
the
tail
of
the
saurean
appeared
slowly
described
a
half
circle
and
went
the
big
alligator
then
lifted
itself
and
performed
some
grotesque
antics
with
deliberation
and
gravity
then
it
gathered
speed
it
rotated
thrashed
and
drummed
it
did
all
that
a
maniac
might
i
think
the
natives
shrieked
i
think
jim
kept
saying
hell
for
i
was
conscious
only
with
my
eyes
when
the
dizzy
reptile
recovered
it
shot
away
among
the
trees
like
a
torpedo
we
went
home
that
night
i
understand
the
second
mate
was
kept
awake
listening
to
me
as
i
slept
bursting
into
spasms
of
dreadful
merriment
when
you
are
lost
in
the
map
of
a
country
that
is
beyond
the
worn
routes
trying
to
discover
therein
the
place
name
which
is
the
most
secluded
and
inaccessible
if
the
map
should
happen
to
be
that
of
south
america
then
your
thought
would
naturally
wander
to
the
neighbourhood
of
san
antonio
of
the
rio
madeira
there
you
stay
to
wonder
what
strange
people
and
rocks
and
trees
are
to
be
found
at
san
antonio
it
looks
remote
even
on
the
map
the
sign
which
stands
for
the
village
is
caught
in
a
central
loop
of
the
mesh
which
is
the
river
system
of
the
amazon
forest
san
antonio
must
be
beyond
all
and
a
great
journey
it
is
far
outside
the
radius
and
that
would
be
enough
to
be
beyond
the
last
ripple
of
the
traffic
and
at
peace
where
that
dark
disquiet
that
sombre
emanation
which
rises
from
the
soured
earth
where
myriads
have
their
chimneys
their
troubles
and
their
strife
staining
even
the
morning
and
the
morning
thought
is
no
more
a
place
where
the
light
has
the
clarity
of
the
first
dawn
and
one
might
hear
while
sure
of
absolute
solitude
the
winding
of
a
strange
horn
and
suspect
when
coming
to
an
opening
in
the
woods
the
flight
of
a
shining
one
for
somewhere
the
ancient
gods
must
have
sanctuary
a
land
where
the
rocks
have
the
moss
of
unvisited
fastnesses
and
you
can
snuff
the
scents
of
original
day
where
we
were
anchored
san
antonio
was
in
view
about
five
miles
up
stream
where
at
the
end
of
that
reach
of
river
a
line
of
tremulous
light
which
we
thought
was
the
cataracts
bridged
the
converging
palisades
of
the
jungle
in
the
trees
of
the
right
bank
it
was
sometimes
easy
to
believe
there
was
a
glint
of
white
buildings
but
looking
again
to
reassure
your
sight
the
apparition
of
dwellings
vanished
at
night
in
the
quiet
sometimes
the
ears
could
detect
the
shudder
of
the
weighty
rapids
by
san
antonio
but
it
was
merely
a
tremor
felt
there
was
no
sound
the
village
remained
to
us
for
some
time
just
that
uncertain
gleam
by
day
and
the
rapids
but
a
minute
reduction
of
a
turmoil
that
was
far
for
in
that
languorous
heat
we
counted
miles
differently
and
it
was
pleasanter
to
suspect
than
to
go
and
prove
and
much
easier
one
day
i
went
when
in
a
small
boat
the
jungle
towered
the
river
too
had
a
different
character
from
the
shore
or
from
the
big
capella
the
river
was
an
expanse
of
light
an
impression
of
shining
peace
whenever
you
got
close
to
its
surface
it
became
alive
and
menacingly
intimate
our
little
boat
seemed
to
roll
in
the
powerful
folds
of
a
monster
which
wallowed
ponderously
and
without
ceasing
the
trees
afloat
charging
down
swiftly
and
in
what
one
felt
was
an
ominous
quiet
stood
well
above
our
tiny
craft
we
steered
close
to
avoid
the
drifting
wood
and
the
set
of
the
current
the
jungle
s
sheer
height
confusion
and
intensity
were
more
awesome
than
when
seen
from
the
steamer
not
many
of
the
trees
were
of
great
beam
but
their
consistent
height
with
the
lianas
in
a
wreck
from
the
far
overhanging
cornice
dwarfed
our
boat
to
an
unimportant
straw
at
times
the
forest
had
a
selvage
of
cane
and
growths
of
arrow
grass
bearing
long
white
plumes
twelve
feet
above
us
and
a
pair
of
leaves
resembling
palm
leaves
the
sound
of
the
cataracts
increased
and
a
barrier
grew
in
height
athwart
the
madeira
mounting
high
right
ahead
of
us
at
last
was
a
mass
of
granite
boulders
with
broad
smooth
surfaces
having
the
structure
of
gigantic
masonry
in
ruin
which
weathered
plutonic
rock
so
often
assumes
beyond
the
barrier
the
river
was
plainly
above
our
level
it
was
seen
resplendent
as
quicksilver
through
the
crenellations
of
the
black
rocks
one
central
mass
of
rock
higher
than
the
rest
had
a
crown
of
dark
and
individual
palms
standing
paramount
in
the
upper
light
yet
with
that
gleam
of
wide
river
behind
no
great
rush
of
water
broke
there
a
few
fountains
spurted
apparently
without
source
and
collapsed
and
pulsed
again
the
white
runnels
of
foam
which
laced
the
contours
of
the
piled
boulders
gave
the
barrier
the
appearance
of
being
miraculously
uplifted
as
though
one
saw
thin
daylight
through
its
interstices
not
till
the
village
was
in
view
did
we
see
where
the
main
river
avoided
the
barrier
the
course
here
was
looped
above
the
barrier
the
river
turned
from
the
right
bank
and
heaped
itself
in
a
smooth
steep
glide
through
a
narrow
pass
against
the
opposite
shore
the
roaring
welter
then
running
obliquely
across
the
foot
of
the
rocks
to
the
front
of
san
antonio
on
the
right
bank
again
the
forest
beside
the
falls
seemed
to
be
tremulous
with
continuous
and
profound
underground
thunder
the
little
huddle
of
san
antonio
s
white
houses
is
on
slightly
rising
ground
and
the
lambent
green
of
the
jungle
is
beside
them
and
over
them
the
foliage
presses
the
village
down
to
the
river
like
every
amazonian
town
and
village
it
appears
set
in
that
forest
as
rare
a
human
foothold
as
a
ship
in
a
few
lights
and
a
few
voices
in
the
dark
and
interminable
wastes
so
i
landed
from
our
little
craft
elated
with
a
sense
of
luckily
acquired
security
the
white
embowered
village
the
leaping
fountains
and
the
rocks
the
air
in
a
flutter
with
the
shock
of
ponderous
water
collapsing
the
surmounting
island
in
with
its
coronet
of
palms
the
indians
idling
among
the
bolivian
rubber
boats
hauled
up
to
the
foreshore
below
the
unexplored
jungle
which
closed
in
and
framed
the
scene
the
fierce
sun
set
in
the
rounded
amplitude
of
the
clouds
of
the
rains
made
the
tropical
picture
which
was
the
right
reward
for
a
great
journey
i
had
come
down
long
weeks
of
empty
leisure
in
which
the
mind
got
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
cities
where
time
is
so
carefully
measured
and
highly
valued
the
centre
of
the
ultimate
wilderness
was
more
than
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
now
a
personal
conviction
which
needed
no
verification
the
village
had
but
one
street
there
were
two
rows
of
houses
of
a
single
storey
built
of
clay
and
plaster
dilapidated
the
whitewash
stained
and
peeling
every
house
open
and
cavernous
below
without
doors
in
the
way
of
brazilian
dwellings
to
give
coolness
the
street
was
almost
deserted
when
we
entered
it
a
few
children
played
in
the
shadows
and
outside
one
house
a
merchant
in
a
white
cotton
suit
stood
overlooking
the
scales
while
the
weighed
balls
of
rubber
for
this
town
is
in
the
midst
of
the
richest
rubber
country
of
the
world
and
all
the
wealth
of
the
rivers
mamoré
beni
and
madre
de
dios
comes
this
way
and
that
was
why
as
we
idled
through
its
single
thoroughfare
some
dark
girls
came
to
stand
at
the
house
openings
dressed
in
odorous
muslin
red
flowers
in
their
shiny
black
hair
and
their
smiling
eyes
full
of
interest
in
us
the
rough
road
between
the
dwellings
was
overgrown
with
grass
and
in
the
centre
of
it
partly
hidden
by
the
grass
was
the
line
laid
long
ago
by
the
railway
enterprise
which
ended
so
tragically
the
rubber
men
use
it
as
a
portage
for
their
boats
there
were
several
inns
names
painted
on
their
outer
walls
they
had
crude
interior
walls
of
mud
and
floors
of
bare
earth
in
such
an
inn
would
be
a
few
iron
tables
and
chairs
and
there
a
visitor
might
drink
from
bottles
which
at
least
bore
european
labels
though
the
contents
and
cost
were
past
all
european
understanding
i
forgot
to
say
that
by
the
foreshore
of
this
little
village
is
the
head
depôt
of
a
great
rubber
house
a
building
apparently
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
size
of
san
antonio
but
i
looked
on
that
place
with
the
less
interest
though
from
what
my
native
companion
told
me
the
head
of
the
house
is
a
monarch
more
absolute
and
undisputed
in
this
wild
country
than
most
eastern
kings
are
i
was
more
interested
in
the
huge
boulders
of
smooth
granite
which
rose
strangely
from
the
street
in
places
and
broke
its
regularity
these
rounded
and
noble
rocks
often
topped
the
houses
what
man
had
built
looked
mean
and
transitory
beside
the
poise
and
fine
contours
of
the
rocks
the
colony
of
giant
rocks
had
a
look
of
settled
and
tranquil
solidity
a
friendly
and
hospitable
aspect
they
might
have
been
old
friends
which
time
had
proved
the
houses
beside
them
were
alien
by
contrast
i
felt
that
san
antonio
had
merely
imposed
itself
on
them
that
they
tolerated
the
village
because
it
was
but
an
incident
that
they
could
afford
to
wait
when
i
saw
them
there
i
recognised
the
village
of
my
map
i
climbed
to
the
summit
of
one
over
its
shelves
it
had
a
skin
of
lichen
warm
in
the
sun
and
harshly
familiar
the
curious
hieroglyphics
of
the
lichen
were
intelligible
enough
and
more
easily
read
than
the
signs
on
the
walls
of
the
inns
i
learned
where
i
was
and
knew
that
when
the
day
of
the
great
rubber
house
had
long
passed
my
village
would
still
be
there
and
prospering
below
my
rock
on
the
land
which
i
had
turned
my
a
monstrous
cesspool
it
was
in
the
centre
of
the
village
it
was
the
capital
of
all
flies
and
the
source
and
origin
of
all
smells
varying
smells
which
reposed
as
i
had
found
when
below
in
the
hot
and
stagnant
street
in
strata
each
layer
of
smell
invisible
but
among
the
weeds
in
the
roads
were
many
derelict
cans
over
the
empty
tins
and
the
garbage
pulsed
and
darted
hundreds
of
brazil
s
wonderful
insects
but
i
was
above
all
that
on
my
high
rock
its
height
released
me
to
a
wide
and
splendid
liberty
i
can
not
tell
you
all
that
my
vantage
surveyed
but
chiefly
i
was
assured
by
what
i
saw
that
i
was
more
central
even
than
my
eyes
showed
they
merely
found
for
me
the
intimation
here
was
all
the
proof
i
wanted
for
faith
is
not
blind
but
critical
yet
instantly
transcends
to
knowledge
at
the
faintest
glimmer
of
authentic
light
as
when
an
exile
who
is
beset
by
inexplicable
and
puissant
circumstance
among
strangers
whose
tongue
is
barbarous
is
surprised
at
a
secret
sign
passed
there
of
fellowship
and
is
at
once
content
yet
i
can
report
but
a
broad
river
flowing
smooth
and
bright
out
of
indefinite
distance
between
dark
forests
to
the
wooded
islands
below
and
by
the
islands
suddenly
accelerated
and
divided
in
a
slight
descent
pouring
to
a
lower
level
in
taut
floods
as
smooth
noiseless
and
polished
as
mercury
lower
still
was
the
gleaming
turmoil
of
the
falls
pulsing
and
ever
on
the
point
of
vanishing
but
constant
its
shouting
riot
baffled
by
the
green
cliffs
everywhere
but
i
could
escape
for
once
over
the
parapets
of
the
jungle
to
the
upper
rolling
ocean
of
leaves
to
the
distance
dim
and
blue
the
region
where
man
has
never
been
there
was
a
man
who
looked
like
a
sensational
ruffian
who
boarded
us
one
morning
at
porto
velho
and
said
he
had
come
to
find
me
he
was
going
up
into
the
forest
beyond
the
track
and
would
i
go
with
him
that
made
me
look
at
him
again
and
with
some
anxiety
for
i
had
tried
before
to
get
away
but
the
crowd
on
the
capella
disliked
the
idea
the
doctor
talked
dysentery
and
things
he
said
it
was
safer
to
keep
to
the
ship
during
the
month
we
had
still
to
spend
at
porto
velho
i
felt
overborne
by
their
arguments
a
rather
thin
sort
of
adventurer
that
mysterious
railway
would
have
drawn
the
mind
of
any
man
who
had
not
lost
his
curiosity
and
who
valued
being
alive
more
than
his
chance
of
old
age
the
track
went
from
porto
velho
into
outer
darkness
it
left
the
clearing
and
the
village
of
mushroom
buildings
the
place
where
the
inhuman
had
been
moderately
subdued
where
a
modicum
of
industry
was
established
in
a
continent
of
primitive
wild
crossed
a
creek
by
a
trestle
bridge
in
view
of
our
steamer
and
vanished
that
was
the
end
of
it
so
far
as
we
knew
men
came
back
to
the
settlement
through
that
hole
of
the
forest
and
boarded
the
capella
to
tell
us
in
long
hot
nights
something
of
what
the
forest
of
the
madeira
was
hiding
and
they
were
bearded
like
crusoe
pallid
as
anæmic
women
and
speckled
with
insect
bites
these
men
said
that
where
they
had
been
working
the
sun
never
shone
for
his
light
was
stopped
on
the
unbroken
green
which
except
where
the
big
rivers
flowed
roofed
the
whole
land
i
liked
the
look
of
the
stranger
who
had
come
to
persuade
me
to
this
rare
holiday
he
said
his
name
was
marion
hill
of
texas
he
wore
muddy
riding
breeches
and
a
black
shirt
open
at
the
throat
and
boots
of
intricately
embossed
leather
which
came
well
up
his
thighs
spurs
that
would
have
ravelled
a
pachyderm
and
the
insolent
hat
of
a
bandit
he
had
a
waistbelt
heavy
with
guns
and
ammunition
i
saw
his
face
and
divined
instantly
that
this
was
a
man
and
that
the
memory
of
a
time
with
him
would
serve
me
as
a
refuge
in
the
grey
and
barren
years
and
as
a
solace
i
told
him
i
would
get
my
things
together
the
skipper
called
after
me
that
if
i
returned
too
late
i
should
have
to
walk
home
there
was
a
commissary
train
next
morning
taking
men
and
supplies
to
the
camps
it
had
a
number
of
open
waggons
loaded
with
material
about
which
the
labourers
going
up
to
replenish
the
gangs
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
they
could
i
had
an
indiarubber
bag
for
all
my
belongings
being
told
that
it
was
best
for
strapping
to
a
mule
and
a
valuable
lifebuoy
when
a
canoe
overturned
i
accepted
it
with
perfect
faith
for
i
knew
nothing
of
mules
or
canoes
the
train
moved
off
a
bell
on
the
engine
ringing
sepulchrally
hill
and
i
were
packed
into
a
box
car
which
had
a
door
open
on
either
side
for
light
and
air
two
american
engineers
were
in
charge
there
was
an
austrian
to
superintend
the
distribution
at
each
camp
of
the
provisions
the
austrian
had
an
italian
assistant
and
a
few
barbadian
blacks
were
there
to
move
about
the
packages
i
sat
on
a
case
of
tinned
fruit
hill
reposed
on
one
of
the
shelves
where
we
should
stow
fever
victims
when
we
collected
them
there
was
no
more
room
in
the
car
and
another
degree
of
heat
would
have
meant
complete
ruin
when
porto
velho
is
left
for
the
place
where
the
line
is
to
end
when
completed
though
it
is
but
miles
away
two
months
at
least
is
required
for
the
return
journey
that
way
goes
the
paymaster
with
his
armed
escort
and
every
bundle
of
shovels
and
tin
of
provisions
when
i
went
too
the
train
helped
for
sixty
miles
then
most
of
the
material
was
transported
at
the
rio
caracoles
a
tributary
of
the
madeira
and
taken
by
boats
in
stages
up
the
main
stream
cargoes
and
boats
being
hauled
round
each
cataract
travellers
could
shorten
the
journey
by
going
overland
part
of
the
way
mules
being
kept
on
the
hither
side
of
the
caracoles
river
for
that
purpose
we
delivered
some
patients
at
the
hospital
went
through
a
cutting
of
red
granite
to
the
back
of
san
antonio
and
then
entered
the
forest
that
absorbed
us
thenceforward
and
until
i
reached
the
ship
again
i
was
dominated
by
the
lofty
silent
confused
and
brooding
growth
everywhere
it
was
dramatically
passionate
in
its
intensity
an
arrested
riot
of
green
life
and
its
muteness
kept
expectant
attention
fixed
upon
it
the
right
of
way
through
the
forest
was
a
hundred
feet
wide
on
each
side
of
us
the
trees
rose
like
virid
cliffs
the
trees
usually
were
of
slender
girth
almost
as
straight
as
fir
poles
rising
perhaps
for
sixty
feet
without
a
branch
occasionally
there
was
a
giant
a
silk
cotton
tree
or
the
strange
tree
with
its
grey
trunk
and
pale
habit
of
foliage
which
i
had
noticed
on
the
riverside
but
they
were
not
common
palms
were
numerous
from
ground
to
high
parapet
the
spaces
between
the
columns
were
filled
with
lianas
unrelated
big
leaves
and
the
characteristic
fronds
of
the
endogens
in
this
older
part
of
the
track
though
it
had
been
made
but
little
more
than
a
year
the
scrub
was
dense
the
undergrowth
was
often
so
strong
and
aggressive
as
to
brush
the
train
as
we
slowly
bumped
along
sometimes
we
went
through
deep
cuttings
in
the
red
clay
close
enough
for
me
to
notice
it
was
interstratified
with
waterworn
but
angular
quartz
peebles
but
the
track
usually
was
over
flat
country
only
rarely
crossing
a
gulley
at
every
maintenance
camp
we
stopped
to
deliver
supplies
from
out
of
a
small
huddle
of
shanties
made
of
leaves
and
poles
insignificant
beneath
the
forest
wall
a
number
of
languid
merely
in
pants
and
hats
would
loiter
through
the
hot
sun
to
us
for
their
sustenance
the
men
of
those
secluded
huts
must
have
been
glad
of
our
temporary
uproar
and
our
new
faces
the
bell
rang
and
we
left
them
to
burial
in
their
deep
silence
again
there
were
intervening
camps
which
had
been
deserted
as
the
work
progressed
these
were
even
more
interesting
to
me
the
work
of
the
human
when
he
leaves
it
to
the
wild
from
which
he
has
won
it
with
so
much
pain
has
an
appeal
of
its
own
with
its
abandoned
ruin
returning
to
the
ground
again
there
would
be
a
sandy
swamp
and
standing
back
from
the
line
some
shanties
with
roofs
awry
i
am
sure
there
were
ghosts
in
those
camps
one
we
passed
and
it
was
called
camp
and
resting
against
its
open
front
where
the
posts
were
giving
was
a
butterfly
net
i
pointed
this
out
oh
that
said
hill
old
man
biddell
i
knew
him
he
was
all
right
he
was
great
on
bugs
and
butterflies
used
to
wear
spectacles
he
was
a
good
engineer
though
died
of
blackwater
fever
before
the
line
got
past
this
camp
that
was
his
and
that
was
his
butterfly
net
all
of
biddell
now
his
sole
monument
and
reminder
as
we
bumped
by
the
huts
the
helicons
and
swallow
tails
rose
precipitously
from
the
mangled
cans
and
cast
rubbish
i
never
knew
biddell
the
man
with
spectacles
and
a
butterfly
net
but
a
first
rate
railway
man
who
left
that
net
outside
his
hut
one
morning
and
at
evening
was
buried
but
now
i
am
doomed
to
think
of
him
while
i
live
it
was
near
midnight
when
we
reached
the
last
active
camp
but
one
on
the
line
where
we
alighted
it
was
wiser
i
was
told
to
run
the
remaining
length
of
the
track
by
daylight
here
a
doctor
and
a
few
engineers
bearing
handlamps
against
which
moths
were
blundering
met
us
in
a
place
which
seemed
to
be
the
bottom
of
a
well
for
the
black
shadows
which
rose
round
us
shut
out
all
but
a
few
stars
the
men
raised
joyous
cries
at
the
sight
of
hill
and
they
took
this
stranger
on
trust
we
fed
in
a
hut
which
was
four
poles
and
a
roof
one
pole
had
a
hurricane
lamp
tied
to
it
there
was
an
enormous
quiet
which
the
men
seemed
to
delight
in
breaking
with
their
voices
four
planks
nailed
unevenly
to
uprights
was
our
table
and
we
sat
crooked
on
a
similar
but
lower
construction
we
ate
out
of
enamelled
plates
with
iron
instruments
and
it
was
very
good
indeed
there
were
four
of
us
who
were
white
and
we
were
babes
in
the
wood
one
of
us
pretended
he
was
playing
on
a
jew
sang
songs
riotously
and
then
began
to
talk
long
and
earnestly
of
new
york
these
men
lived
in
four
railway
waggons
which
had
doors
made
of
copper
gauze
berths
with
mosquito
bars
and
portraits
of
the
folk
at
home
and
in
the
case
of
the
doctor
the
waggon
smelt
of
iodoform
had
one
wall
full
of
bottles
and
a
table
with
a
board
and
chessmen
in
one
of
those
waggons
i
lay
down
to
sleep
under
a
net
but
the
blanket
felt
damp
and
had
a
foreign
smell
my
thoughts
crowded
me
for
long
i
listened
to
so
much
jungle
pressing
close
to
my
bed
waiting
for
it
to
make
known
its
near
but
unseen
presence
with
a
voice
but
it
did
not
next
morning
at
sunrise
the
train
moved
forward
to
the
construction
camp
at
the
rio
caracoles
i
rode
on
a
truck
pushed
in
front
of
the
locomotive
perched
there
with
some
engineers
who
kept
a
careful
eye
on
the
track
i
saw
at
once
why
the
train
did
not
proceed
at
night
it
was
too
speculative
altogether
behind
us
the
locomotive
s
smoke
stack
rolled
like
a
steamer
s
funnel
when
a
beam
sea
is
running
this
part
of
the
line
crossed
many
ravines
where
we
looked
down
upon
the
tree
tops
and
when
on
a
frail
wooden
bridge
which
crossed
a
vacancy
like
that
such
movements
of
the
drunken
engine
behind
us
became
dazzling
then
too
there
were
some
high
fills
or
embankments
after
heavy
rains
these
have
a
habit
of
retiring
from
the
metals
which
are
left
looped
and
twisted
in
an
engineer
told
me
that
one
can
not
always
tell
when
an
embankment
is
on
the
point
of
retiring
he
was
carefully
watching
however
but
we
reached
the
construction
camp
at
the
construction
camp
by
the
side
of
the
rio
caracoles
we
stayed
two
days
there
was
the
end
of
the
line
and
the
men
who
were
growing
the
track
were
so
busy
that
i
was
left
to
my
own
devices
till
the
railwaymen
came
none
but
the
caripuna
indians
knew
what
was
there
so
into
the
woods
of
course
i
would
go
trying
every
track
which
led
from
the
camp
a
botanist
might
have
seen
some
difference
from
the
forest
at
porto
velho
but
i
could
not
discover
any
in
appearance
it
was
exactly
the
same
the
trees
mostly
were
arborescent
laurels
i
believe
with
smooth
brown
boles
which
were
blotched
through
their
outer
cuticle
peeling
away
much
in
the
manner
of
that
of
the
plane
tree
the
brown
parchments
of
their
leaves
covered
the
floor
of
the
woods
the
trees
were
rarely
of
great
diameter
but
their
crowns
were
so
distant
that
nothing
could
be
made
of
their
living
foliage
i
saw
no
flowers
at
all
there
were
few
orchids
but
the
large
shapely
emerald
coloured
leaves
of
pothos
plants
were
very
frequent
sitting
in
the
angles
of
branches
and
trunk
aloft
was
always
the
wreckage
of
vines
suspended
as
vaguely
seen
and
as
motionless
as
cobwebs
and
dilapidations
in
the
overhead
darkness
of
high
vaults
i
rarely
heard
a
sound
in
that
forest
though
there
was
a
bird
which
called
i
often
heard
it
in
the
woods
of
the
upper
madeira
it
called
thrice
as
a
boy
who
whistles
shrilly
through
his
fingers
a
long
call
and
then
another
whistle
in
the
same
key
followed
instantly
by
a
falling
note
one
delightful
walk
was
along
a
path
which
had
not
been
made
by
the
railwaymen
for
it
was
evidently
old
as
it
ran
a
cleft
in
the
trees
not
through
broken
timber
but
in
partial
sunshine
with
a
mesh
of
vines
and
freely
growing
plants
on
either
side
it
led
downwards
to
a
small
stream
which
was
cumbered
with
fallen
and
rotting
timber
a
cool
hollow
where
ferns
were
abundant
it
was
in
the
woods
at
the
caracoles
that
i
first
saw
the
great
morpho
butterfly
at
home
this
species
peculiar
to
south
america
is
rarely
seen
except
in
the
shades
of
the
virgin
forest
one
day
in
the
twilight
aisles
near
the
caracoles
camp
where
nothing
moved
and
all
was
a
grey
monotone
it
so
surprised
me
with
its
happy
undulating
though
it
danced
along
and
were
in
no
great
size
and
its
bright
blue
wings
that
i
rose
mesmerised
stumbling
after
it
through
the
dank
litter
thoughtless
of
direction
not
thinking
of
the
danger
of
losing
my
way
thinking
of
nothing
but
that
joyous
resplendent
creature
dancing
aloft
ahead
of
me
in
the
gloom
and
just
beyond
my
reach
its
polished
blue
wings
flashed
like
speculæ
it
might
have
been
a
drifting
fragment
of
sunny
sky
i
had
never
seen
anything
alive
so
beautiful
a
fall
over
a
log
brought
me
to
sobriety
and
when
i
looked
up
it
was
gone
afterwards
i
saw
many
of
them
sometimes
when
walking
the
forest
there
would
be
morphos
always
in
sight
the
construction
camp
was
not
more
than
a
month
old
perched
on
an
escarpment
by
the
line
was
a
row
of
tents
and
at
the
back
of
the
tents
some
flimsy
huts
built
of
forest
stuff
they
stood
about
a
ruin
of
felled
trees
with
a
midden
and
its
butterflies
in
the
midst
probably
thirty
white
men
were
stationed
there
they
were
then
throwing
a
wooden
bridge
across
the
caracoles
most
of
them
were
young
american
civil
engineers
though
some
were
english
and
when
i
found
one
of
he
happened
to
be
a
countryman
of
himself
on
a
narrow
beam
high
over
a
swift
current
and
regardless
of
the
air
heavy
with
vapour
and
the
torrid
sun
directing
the
disposal
of
awkward
weights
with
a
concentration
and
keenness
which
made
me
recall
with
regret
the
way
i
do
things
at
times
i
saw
his
profession
with
a
new
regard
i
noticed
the
men
of
that
transient
little
settlement
in
the
wilds
were
in
constant
high
spirits
they
betrayed
nothing
of
the
gravity
of
their
undertaking
they
might
have
been
boys
employed
at
some
elaborate
jest
but
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
pose
of
heartiness
they
repelled
reality
with
a
laugh
and
a
hand
clapped
to
your
shoulder
at
our
mess
table
over
the
dishes
of
toucan
and
parrot
supplied
by
the
camp
hunters
they
rallied
each
other
boisterously
there
was
a
touch
of
defiance
in
the
way
they
referred
to
the
sickness
and
the
shadow
for
it
was
notorious
that
changes
were
frequent
in
their
little
garrison
they
were
forced
to
talk
of
these
changes
and
this
was
the
way
they
chose
to
do
it
as
if
laughter
was
their
only
prophylactic
but
such
laughter
to
a
visitor
who
did
not
have
to
wait
till
fever
took
him
but
could
go
when
he
liked
could
be
answered
only
with
a
friendly
smile
some
of
my
cheery
friends
of
the
caracoles
were
but
the
ghosts
of
men
hill
warned
me
late
one
afternoon
to
be
ready
to
start
at
sunrise
and
then
went
to
play
poker
on
my
way
to
my
hut
at
sunset
i
stopped
to
gossip
with
the
young
doctor
where
he
was
busy
dressing
wounds
at
his
surgery
the
labourers
brazilians
and
bolivian
spaniards
work
being
over
were
giving
the
doctor
a
full
evening
with
their
ailments
mostly
these
were
skin
troubles
the
least
abrasion
in
the
tropics
may
spread
to
a
horrid
and
persistent
wound
the
legs
of
the
majority
of
these
natives
were
unpleasant
with
livid
scars
in
one
case
a
vampire
bat
had
punctured
a
man
s
arm
near
the
elbow
while
he
slept
and
that
little
wound
had
grown
disastrously
we
were
in
a
region
where
the
pium
flies
swarmed
tiny
black
insects
which
alight
on
the
hands
and
face
perhaps
a
dozen
at
a
time
and
gorge
themselves
though
you
may
be
unconscious
of
it
where
the
pium
fly
feeds
it
leaves
a
dot
of
extravasated
blood
which
remains
for
weeks
so
that
most
of
us
were
speckled
even
these
minute
wounds
were
liable
to
become
deep
and
bad
there
were
larger
flies
which
put
their
eggs
in
the
human
body
where
they
hatch
with
dire
results
do
not
think
the
splendid
tropics
have
nothing
but
verdure
orchids
butterflies
and
coral
snakes
banded
orange
and
black
and
crimson
and
black
so
the
doctor
was
a
busy
man
that
evening
the
floor
of
his
surgery
was
made
of
unequal
boughs
the
walls
and
roof
were
of
dried
fronds
a
lamp
was
slung
on
a
doorpost
he
was
a
young
american
and
he
did
not
grumble
at
his
bumpy
floor
the
bad
light
the
appliances
and
remedies
which
were
all
one
should
expect
in
the
jungle
nor
the
number
of
his
patients
except
comically
he
told
me
he
was
rather
keen
on
the
diseases
of
the
tropics
he
liked
them
i
should
think
he
must
have
liked
them
he
was
merrily
insolent
with
those
swarthy
and
melancholy
men
and
they
smiled
back
sadly
at
the
clever
handsome
and
lively
youngster
he
was
quick
in
his
decisions
deft
insistent
kind
and
thorough
working
down
that
file
of
pitiable
humanity
as
careful
with
the
last
of
the
long
row
as
with
the
first
telling
me
as
he
went
along
much
that
i
had
never
heard
before
with
demonstrations
don
t
go
he
cried
when
i
would
have
left
him
for
i
thought
it
might
be
he
was
as
kind
with
this
stranger
as
he
was
with
the
others
ah
don
t
go
let
me
hear
a
true
word
or
he
said
he
would
give
me
a
treat
if
i
stayed
he
finished
put
his
materials
away
deliberately
accurately
his
back
to
me
while
i
saluted
him
as
a
fine
representative
of
ours
he
turned
free
of
his
task
and
jolly
and
produced
that
treat
of
his
two
bottles
of
treasured
and
precious
ginger
ale
it
was
a
miracle
performed
we
talked
till
the
light
went
out
much
later
a
cry
in
the
woods
woke
me
it
was
yet
dark
but
i
could
see
hill
up
and
fumbling
with
his
accoutrements
out
i
jumped
though
still
unreasonably
tired
and
sleepily
dressed
when
i
turned
to
hill
to
see
if
he
were
ready
he
was
then
under
his
net
watching
me
he
explained
he
had
just
returned
from
poker
and
was
wondering
why
i
was
dressing
but
did
not
like
to
ask
knowing
that
englishmen
have
ways
that
are
not
american
so
the
sun
was
up
long
before
we
were
though
presently
in
a
small
canoe
we
embarked
on
the
caracoles
this
tributary
of
the
madeira
comes
from
nobody
knows
where
it
is
a
river
of
the
kind
which
explorers
in
these
forests
have
sometimes
mentioned
to
our
fearful
joy
the
sunlight
hardly
reached
the
water
the
river
was
merely
a
drain
burrowing
under
the
jungle
the
forest
on
its
banks
met
overhead
there
was
little
foliage
below
we
saw
but
the
base
of
the
forest
grey
columns
that
might
have
been
of
stone
upholding
a
darkness
from
which
dead
stuff
suspended
the
canoe
had
to
dodge
the
lianas
which
dropped
to
the
water
the
noise
of
our
paddles
convoyed
us
down
stream
a
rout
of
panic
echoes
trying
to
escape
we
came
to
an
opening
and
full
daylight
presently
and
landed
by
a
mule
corral
and
i
began
a
lonely
ride
with
hill
through
the
forest
the
mule
was
such
a
docile
little
brown
creature
that
i
was
left
in
the
silence
to
my
thoughts
which
were
interrupted
now
and
then
by
the
wandering
blue
flame
of
a
morpho
my
mule
followed
hill
s
mule
along
a
winding
trail
and
our
leader
was
nearly
always
out
of
sight
i
do
not
remember
much
of
my
first
ride
in
the
forest
i
had
an
impression
of
being
at
a
viewless
distance
from
the
sun
we
were
on
the
abysmal
floor
of
a
growth
which
was
not
trees
but
the
hoary
pediments
of
a
structure
which
was
too
high
and
vast
for
human
sight
we
rode
in
the
basal
gloom
of
it
no
more
than
lost
ants
there
at
an
immeasurable
depth
in
the
atmosphere
the
roof
of
the
world
was
far
away
somewhere
was
the
sun
for
occasionally
there
was
a
well
which
its
light
had
filled
and
a
grove
of
green
palms
complete
and
personal
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
living
and
reasonable
shapes
or
one
of
the
morphos
would
flicker
among
those
spectral
bastions
aerial
and
bright
as
a
fairy
in
hades
the
sombre
mind
caught
it
at
once
an
unexpected
gleam
of
hope
a
bright
blue
thought
to
set
among
one
s
shapeless
fears
we
descended
into
hollows
going
down
into
darker
fathoms
of
the
shades
mounted
again
through
brighter
suffusions
of
day
and
in
a
while
came
out
upon
the
open
lane
in
the
woods
the
long
cut
in
the
jungle
made
for
the
railway
when
it
should
get
so
far
now
i
could
see
my
companion
he
was
from
texas
and
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
in
the
long
rides
which
followed
in
the
land
where
we
looked
upon
what
was
there
for
the
first
time
since
genesis
where
we
might
have
been
in
the
hush
of
the
seventh
day
so
new
strange
and
quiet
was
all
the
figure
ahead
of
me
with
its
long
boots
negligent
black
shirt
the
guns
about
the
waist
and
the
hat
with
its
extravagant
size
nobly
raked
made
me
stop
at
times
to
assure
myself
that
i
was
not
pursuing
a
of
boyhood
too
much
mayne
reid
in
my
head
especially
when
my
wild
and
improbable
companion
paused
under
a
group
of
statuesque
palms
and
looked
back
at
suppose
to
make
sure
that
i
was
still
there
and
that
the
silence
had
not
absorbed
me
utterly
a
faint
rustle
of
intruding
sound
in
a
virgin
and
absorbent
world
and
again
i
remember
the
sparkle
and
lift
of
early
morning
there
the
air
was
new
it
was
stimulative
it
recharged
me
with
buoyant
youth
to
breathe
that
air
in
the
fresh
of
the
morning
was
exaltation
and
to
see
the
young
sunlight
on
the
ardent
foliage
was
to
know
the
springs
of
life
were
full
that
was
at
the
breakfast
hour
when
the
camp
fires
crackled
and
were
aromatic
the
smoke
going
straight
to
the
tree
tops
then
quickly
the
narrow
track
through
the
forest
filled
with
day
increased
in
heat
till
i
felt
i
could
bear
no
more
of
it
and
so
gazed
vacantly
at
the
mule
s
ears
merely
enduring
and
numbed
the
vitality
of
the
morning
went
and
in
the
fierce
pour
of
light
i
looked
no
more
to
the
strange
leaves
and
vines
the
curious
fronds
the
anthills
by
the
way
the
butterflies
and
birds
but
had
only
a
dull
dread
that
the
avenue
through
which
we
were
riding
was
straight
and
interminable
there
was
no
escape
from
this
heat
there
were
no
openings
through
which
we
could
retreat
under
the
trees
the
air
was
immobile
the
air
itself
was
the
incumbent
heat
the
only
shadows
were
under
the
mules
bellies
cruel
and
relentless
noons
how
the
surveyors
endured
it
standing
for
long
eyeing
their
exacting
instruments
in
such
a
defeating
glare
i
do
not
know
at
the
end
of
each
day
my
pigskin
leggings
were
like
wet
brown
paper
with
sweat
and
my
hands
crinkled
and
bleached
as
though
they
had
been
in
a
soda
bath
we
reached
another
and
greater
tributary
of
the
madeira
the
rio
here
there
was
a
very
extensive
clearing
as
great
as
the
one
at
porto
velho
the
bridging
of
the
jaci
would
be
a
considerable
undertaking
consequently
there
were
numerous
huts
dotted
about
the
rough
open
ground
but
i
think
the
original
intention
in
cutting
back
the
jungle
to
such
an
extent
was
that
in
the
days
to
come
a
town
would
grow
there
i
imagine
it
will
not
and
that
the
project
is
abandoned
in
one
of
my
early
walks
in
the
woods
i
came
by
chance
upon
the
new
cemetery
it
was
already
large
the
jaci
country
has
proved
to
be
more
than
usually
unhealthy
the
ground
was
cleared
down
to
a
coarse
herbage
round
which
stood
shadowing
trees
little
crucifixes
made
by
splitting
a
stick
and
putting
another
stick
crosswise
in
the
slit
were
planted
at
all
sorts
of
drunken
angles
in
the
ground
one
large
cross
in
the
centre
stood
for
all
the
dead
there
were
no
names
given
a
brazil
grew
alongside
this
graveyard
in
the
jungle
so
tall
that
the
flock
of
screaming
parrots
about
its
foliage
were
but
drifting
black
specks
because
hill
had
a
touch
of
the
fever
we
stayed
for
some
days
by
the
jaci
i
had
a
hut
given
to
me
typical
of
the
rest
but
i
was
so
much
alone
in
it
that
that
hut
on
the
jaci
where
our
remoteness
from
human
things
tested
and
known
the
aloofness
and
quiet
of
the
forest
the
deadly
nature
of
the
romantic
and
beautiful
river
bank
where
we
were
marooned
and
the
sickness
of
my
friend
hill
threw
me
upon
my
centre
until
i
began
even
to
talk
to
myself
and
received
such
an
impress
of
the
minute
details
of
my
little
habitation
that
ephemeral
as
it
was
and
now
long
since
gone
it
endures
of
coloured
and
indestructible
stuff
with
a
sunny
portal
i
still
can
enter
whenever
my
mind
turns
that
way
it
was
of
four
palm
trunks
lapped
round
and
over
with
mats
of
leaves
the
floor
was
of
untrimmed
branches
two
feet
from
the
earth
and
their
unexpected
inequalities
never
remembered
were
always
jolting
my
thoughts
as
i
walked
across
they
were
crooked
and
i
could
see
the
dusty
earth
two
feet
beneath
where
brown
and
green
lizards
ran
at
one
end
was
a
verandah
with
a
narrow
floor
made
of
the
lids
of
soap
and
dynamite
boxes
and
laid
without
any
idea
that
some
curious
tenant
might
wish
to
read
the
manufacturers
full
names
and
see
their
complete
trademarks
it
was
a
puzzle
there
was
nothing
to
do
and
i
searched
long
on
my
verandah
floor
for
the
clue
to
one
embarrassing
fragment
of
a
stencilled
word
hill
sometimes
huddled
in
a
hammock
on
one
side
of
the
verandah
a
leg
hanging
limply
over
his
thin
sallow
face
drawn
and
resting
on
his
breast
and
his
eyes
shut
and
i
sat
near
him
on
the
rail
silent
alone
with
any
thought
i
met
and
gazing
blankly
down
the
steep
slope
past
two
tall
brazil
to
the
rio
jaci
below
and
the
roof
of
the
forest
opposite
over
which
the
sun
set
each
day
in
uplifted
splendour
i
remembered
but
one
conversation
during
that
wait
an
elderly
white
man
came
up
to
the
verandah
one
evening
and
murmured
something
to
hill
who
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
his
visitor
under
weary
lids
this
man
was
one
of
hill
s
subordinates
he
had
something
to
say
of
the
work
but
one
would
hardly
call
it
speech
the
flow
of
his
life
was
so
weak
that
he
could
do
no
more
than
lift
a
few
small
words
from
his
gaping
mouth
between
his
breaths
he
held
on
to
the
verandah
his
loose
clothes
hung
straight
down
from
his
bones
the
veins
were
in
blue
knots
on
his
forehead
say
said
hill
rousing
himself
i
want
you
to
ride
to
the
caracoles
go
down
to
porto
velho
and
take
this
note
to
the
the
man
said
nothing
but
nodded
hill
scrawled
his
note
and
the
man
left
he
ll
be
dead
in
a
month
said
hill
five
minutes
after
the
man
had
gone
but
he
would
not
go
to
the
hospital
for
his
health
i
have
to
pretend
that
he
must
go
for
mine
he
may
as
well
die
in
a
comfortable
bed
i
wish
those
damned
parrots
would
cease
they
were
somewhere
down
by
the
river
unseen
but
all
the
sound
there
was
their
voices
long
keen
and
distracting
flaws
in
the
pellucid
and
coloured
dayfall
one
morning
we
crossed
the
jaci
and
on
the
opposite
shore
some
mules
were
already
geared
with
texan
saddles
the
hombres
at
their
heads
waiting
for
us
i
considered
my
mule
he
was
a
big
grey
upstanding
fellow
with
the
legs
and
feet
of
a
racehorse
the
head
of
a
hammer
and
alert
and
inquisitive
ears
he
was
very
much
alive
i
had
no
doubt
he
could
leave
anywhere
like
light
when
he
had
a
mind
for
it
so
that
i
turned
to
hill
and
said
is
mine
a
quiet
animal
is
he
vicious
o
say
said
my
guide
glancing
carelessly
at
my
dubious
mount
i
guess
he
s
just
a
when
a
hombre
shouted
at
my
mule
he
stepped
briskly
with
more
than
a
hint
of
the
malicious
rebel
in
his
gait
i
knew
it
would
happen
and
it
did
one
foot
was
no
sooner
buried
in
a
wooden
shoe
called
a
stirrup
than
he
was
off
like
an
explosion
a
desperate
leap
got
my
other
leg
over
my
travelling
sack
lashed
on
his
rump
and
i
came
down
in
the
saddle
much
surprised
texan
saddles
are
not
leather
pads
for
riding
domestic
creatures
but
thrones
for
ruling
devils
and
the
bit
would
have
broken
the
mouth
of
a
hippopotamus
the
brute
stopped
turned
back
one
ear
and
his
thought
was
in
his
swivel
eye
you
wait
i
saw
him
say
in
the
few
engrossing
moments
when
his
body
was
expanding
and
contracting
under
me
i
got
some
idea
of
the
force
i
was
supposed
to
guide
and
it
did
not
make
my
mind
easy
for
an
office
chair
had
been
my
most
unstable
seat
till
then
yet
off
we
went
quietly
along
the
track
and
hill
was
in
front
and
my
mule
was
as
meek
as
a
sheep
there
came
a
swamp
into
which
he
went
to
the
knees
and
i
dismounted
jumping
from
hummock
to
hummock
encouraging
him
and
showing
him
the
best
places
his
brown
eyes
were
then
like
those
of
a
good
woman
so
leaning
forward
when
we
were
through
i
patted
his
sleek
neck
and
gave
him
pleasant
words
afterwards
when
he
showed
a
certain
precious
care
in
difficult
places
for
the
country
was
very
broken
stepping
like
a
walker
i
was
fool
enough
to
think
it
was
because
of
our
understanding
though
i
believe
he
would
have
deceived
anybody
at
noon
we
left
the
track
and
entered
the
forest
by
a
path
so
narrow
that
the
trees
touched
our
legs
and
sometimes
we
had
just
time
to
duck
beneath
a
noose
which
a
liana
dangled
in
our
faces
it
was
a
low
and
narrow
tunnel
and
it
descended
to
a
bottom
where
a
shallow
stream
brawled
among
granite
boulders
thence
up
the
trail
went
through
the
trees
and
vines
again
and
at
last
we
came
to
a
little
clearing
where
there
was
a
hut
and
men
who
would
give
us
meat
and
drink
we
dismounted
i
rubbed
my
mule
s
soft
nose
and
spoke
him
playfully
as
a
familiar
but
when
entering
the
hut
was
rebuked
by
a
man
there
for
making
a
short
cut
round
the
heels
of
my
mule
never
do
it
don
t
give
him
a
chance
a
mule
will
be
peaches
for
ten
years
waiting
for
the
sure
chance
of
getting
his
heels
right
on
your
stomach
they
re
not
horses
them
mules
they
don
t
bite
and
they
don
t
muzzle
you
and
show
friendly
they
ve
got
no
feelings
that
chap
of
yours
his
mother
was
an
ass
and
his
father
was
old
solfernio
himself
but
they
ve
all
got
one
good
re
the
mule
stood
deep
in
thought
till
i
was
mounted
again
then
instantly
bolted
back
along
the
path
which
led
to
the
ravine
the
idle
hombre
had
mishandled
the
reins
and
i
could
get
no
pull
i
went
across
that
clearing
like
so
hill
said
afterwards
tod
sloan
up
the
beast
his
ears
back
was
in
a
frenzy
and
the
convulsions
of
his
powerful
body
made
my
thoughts
pallid
and
ghastly
nothing
but
disaster
could
stop
him
and
the
black
mouth
of
that
steep
tunnel
in
the
forest
yawned
before
us
and
grew
larger
though
not
large
enough
he
took
the
opening
as
clean
as
a
lucky
shot
but
i
was
laid
carefully
along
his
back
why
we
missed
the
tangle
of
woods
and
the
rocks
in
that
precipitate
descent
is
known
only
to
my
lucky
stars
i
had
my
feet
from
the
stirrups
my
toes
hooked
on
his
rump
one
arm
round
the
horn
of
the
saddle
and
the
other
stretched
along
his
sawing
neck
i
saw
the
roots
and
stones
leap
up
and
by
us
close
to
my
face
several
things
occurred
to
me
and
one
was
that
some
methods
of
dire
fate
were
fatuous
and
undignified
i
wondered
also
whether
i
should
be
taken
back
to
the
ship
or
buried
there
the
impetus
of
the
brute
which
i
expected
would
send
us
somersaulting
among
the
rocks
of
the
bottom
took
him
partly
up
the
hither
slope
and
soon
he
had
to
gather
his
haunches
for
the
upward
leaps
i
slipped
off
he
swung
round
at
the
length
of
the
reins
and
eyed
me
cocking
his
ears
derisively
a
horse
s
nerves
are
and
a
horse
would
have
been
in
a
muck
but
this
murderous
mule
was
calm
and
mocking
i
watched
him
and
listened
for
an
obscene
and
confident
guffaw
i
found
afterwards
that
punishment
has
no
more
effect
on
them
than
kindness
there
is
no
guidance
in
this
matter
take
the
mule
all
round
it
is
dealing
with
the
uncanny
it
is
better
to
cross
yourself
when
you
go
near
a
mule
every
morning
about
a
camp
we
would
watch
the
hombres
gear
up
those
pensive
and
placid
creatures
they
were
sleek
lissom
and
beautiful
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
watch
them
but
as
soon
as
the
business
of
the
day
began
one
of
the
mules
and
there
was
no
prophecy
as
to
which
one
it
would
be
became
a
homicidal
maniac
at
one
camp
it
was
necessary
to
keep
a
hundred
or
more
mules
in
reserve
and
there
for
their
health
a
sane
old
horse
was
kept
also
the
horse
was
a
knacker
s
body
a
sorry
spectacle
and
in
that
climate
he
but
pottered
about
waiting
for
disease
to
take
him
he
was
smaller
than
the
fine
and
healthy
mules
but
the
respect
the
had
for
him
was
comical
and
a
great
help
to
the
men
without
the
horse
it
would
have
been
opening
the
door
of
an
asylum
to
have
let
the
mules
out
of
the
corral
to
water
at
the
river
but
he
led
the
way
and
they
bunched
round
him
bashfully
and
followed
him
to
the
stream
he
took
no
notice
of
them
whatever
he
did
not
flatter
them
by
pretending
to
be
aware
of
their
existence
when
he
had
had
his
fill
he
turned
and
ambled
through
them
scorning
to
see
them
and
returned
to
the
corral
round
went
all
the
mules
nearest
to
him
and
any
of
them
on
the
outskirts
of
the
mob
that
stayed
on
because
they
did
not
see
him
go
lost
their
heads
when
they
looked
up
and
risked
their
necks
in
short
cuts
through
the
timber
ho
mule
would
shout
the
hombres
in
alarm
for
even
mules
cost
money
the
land
through
which
we
were
riding
shall
have
a
little
railway
there
some
day
if
the
men
who
are
building
it
keep
their
hearts
of
brass
and
refuse
in
working
hours
to
remember
london
and
new
york
when
it
is
there
that
short
line
it
will
begin
and
end
in
places
having
names
which
will
convey
little
meaning
to
people
outside
brazil
but
to
know
what
endurance
of
valour
but
chiefly
what
raillery
and
disregard
of
the
gods
who
put
baleful
forests
guarded
by
dragons
of
mythology
were
lambs
to
what
mosquitoes
the
path
of
weak
men
pursuing
their
purpose
to
know
what
has
gone
to
the
building
of
that
track
though
it
nowhere
plainly
shows
for
the
graveyards
are
casual
and
obscure
brings
you
to
a
stand
surprised
into
awe
of
your
fellows
as
though
through
a
coarse
disguise
you
caught
a
gleam
of
divinity
something
shows
a
light
shows
which
is
beyond
human
would
men
be
so
prodigal
of
life
and
time
if
they
were
not
aware
of
their
great
wealth
i
don
t
know
my
travels
never
brought
me
to
that
ultimate
assurance
but
i
did
see
that
my
are
indifferent
spendthrift
with
their
known
and
scanty
store
as
though
they
were
immortals
the
remittance
men
of
great
jove
i
have
no
doubt
now
the
line
will
be
finished
some
day
but
there
were
times
riding
along
the
roughly
cleared
trail
where
it
is
to
be
and
we
came
upon
places
where
men
in
a
spasm
of
pointless
and
soon
expiring
energy
had
scratched
and
mauled
the
pristine
earth
when
i
did
not
think
so
always
the
same
dumb
mystery
was
about
us
at
noon
as
at
nightfall
i
felt
we
were
lost
at
the
back
of
the
world
that
we
had
crossed
the
boundary
beyond
which
the
voice
of
traffic
never
goes
and
were
idly
wandering
on
the
confines
of
oblivion
sometimes
i
had
that
consciousness
of
futility
which
comes
to
us
when
in
sleep
we
are
earnest
in
the
absurd
activities
of
a
dream
one
point
of
the
reason
remaining
awake
to
wonder
at
the
antics
of
the
busy
but
blind
mind
why
was
i
there
at
all
was
i
there
those
forlorn
spots
in
the
forest
where
our
fellows
had
been
before
us
which
we
two
riders
overlooked
alone
seemed
to
show
that
those
men
while
in
the
midst
of
their
feverish
labour
had
recovered
their
minds
and
had
seen
the
wilderness
was
too
vast
was
unconquerable
and
they
had
fled
there
before
us
was
what
they
had
done
a
deep
trench
would
be
in
the
track
the
sand
thrown
up
on
either
side
some
dead
trees
would
be
prone
in
our
path
and
we
had
to
ride
round
them
there
would
be
a
few
empty
huts
of
leaves
with
old
ashes
at
the
entrances
and
a
midden
with
its
usual
gorgeous
butterflies
there
would
not
be
a
sign
of
life
except
the
butterflies
over
the
refuse
and
not
a
sound
or
a
movement
but
a
clink
from
our
own
harness
and
the
heads
of
our
mules
impatient
with
the
flies
over
the
evidence
of
man
s
enterprise
and
industry
his
short
and
ferocious
attack
on
the
wild
brooded
the
forest
that
bent
over
us
and
it
might
have
been
solicitous
and
compassionate
or
it
might
have
been
merely
curious
about
the
behaviour
of
the
surprising
creatures
who
had
come
there
for
the
first
time
and
had
been
so
active
for
a
while
sitting
in
the
pour
of
the
sun
looking
upon
the
scanty
work
of
my
fellows
and
then
upon
the
near
watchful
ranks
of
that
continent
of
trees
pressing
close
to
regard
the
trench
into
which
man
s
hope
might
have
been
thrown
i
had
a
dread
of
the
easy
and
enduring
dominion
of
those
powers
which
were
before
man
we
would
ride
on
then
sometimes
up
to
our
saddles
in
swamps
and
every
day
i
lost
faith
that
there
was
any
company
of
our
fellows
in
that
desolation
who
would
take
our
mules
at
nightfall
and
show
hammocks
for
our
rest
but
always
before
night
caught
us
we
would
spy
a
few
huts
diminutive
under
the
cliffs
of
ho
the
little
outpost
of
two
or
three
engineers
and
a
doctor
would
meet
us
as
we
came
up
such
a
camp
was
like
finding
security
and
fellowship
again
after
the
uncertainty
and
emptiness
of
the
sea
the
voices
of
new
friends
disarmed
the
forest
it
was
not
curious
that
we
found
it
so
easy
to
talk
and
laugh
one
such
camp
i
remember
well
we
came
upon
it
late
and
my
bones
through
a
longer
ride
than
usual
in
the
wooden
saddle
had
grown
into
an
unjointed
frame
this
was
the
real
meaning
of
fatigue
my
body
was
a
comprehensive
ache
yet
my
mind
was
alert
and
buoyant
and
i
remembered
that
perhaps
it
was
so
because
i
had
been
well
bitten
by
the
mosqitoes
of
the
a
first
effect
of
the
inoculation
so
i
swallowed
twenty
grains
of
my
store
of
quinine
you
in
settled
lands
unless
you
have
been
very
poor
indeed
and
know
what
trouble
is
and
what
friends
are
have
never
seen
the
face
of
your
brother
nor
the
serenity
of
evening
when
you
have
found
without
expecting
it
shelter
for
the
night
you
don
t
know
what
the
taste
of
bread
and
meat
is
nor
the
savour
of
tobacco
nor
what
comfortable
security
is
the
whispering
of
a
comrade
unseen
in
the
shadows
of
a
resting
place
nor
what
it
is
to
sleep
i
found
those
gifts
are
not
means
to
life
only
but
reasons
for
living
too
something
to
live
for
with
these
at
nightfall
our
frail
little
hut
beleaguered
in
the
limitless
woods
the
shack
in
which
the
ants
and
spiders
swarmed
and
gross
insects
rang
on
the
metal
lamp
where
we
loafed
in
hammocks
smoking
and
listened
to
the
cries
of
we
knew
not
what
in
the
unknown
about
us
was
impregnable
to
the
hosts
of
darkness
perhaps
i
remember
that
camp
so
well
because
it
was
a
night
of
full
moon
there
were
three
huts
we
were
deep
in
the
trees
the
dark
walls
of
that
well
in
the
jungle
rose
sheer
all
round
us
nobody
knew
what
was
beyond
the
huts
the
moon
appeared
just
clear
of
the
lofty
parapet
of
the
well
and
poured
down
to
us
an
imponderable
rarity
of
bluish
fire
wherever
this
fire
lodged
it
stayed
up
projected
palm
fronds
and
they
were
heavy
patterns
in
burnished
silver
nameless
shapes
grew
luminous
in
the
dark
about
us
the
ragged
thatch
of
a
hut
fell
from
its
apex
in
a
cascade
of
lustrous
fluid
metal
suddenly
congealed
the
gloom
beneath
that
shining
roof
was
hollowed
by
the
pale
yellow
light
of
a
lamp
so
i
could
see
under
the
eaves
the
three
hammocks
slung
from
the
posts
the
quiet
talk
of
my
companions
was
the
only
sound
i
limped
with
weariness
towards
the
voices
and
sat
in
a
shadow
listening
and
looked
beyond
to
sprays
of
motionless
shining
foliage
leaning
out
from
inscrutable
darkness
i
seemed
to
have
escaped
from
my
tired
body
my
disembodied
mind
was
free
and
at
large
a
camp
hunter
had
killed
a
jaguar
there
during
the
afternoon
they
were
saying
there
were
many
about
for
we
were
beyond
the
railway
men
the
track
being
but
a
lane
of
felled
trees
they
were
saying
the
country
there
abounded
with
wild
life
just
as
we
arrived
that
evening
one
of
the
men
brought
in
a
wounded
animal
its
nature
so
disguised
that
i
thought
it
was
a
kind
of
sloth
it
was
about
two
feet
long
and
covered
with
long
grizzled
hair
from
its
snout
to
the
end
of
its
considerable
tail
but
when
i
lifted
it
and
the
poor
injured
creature
shook
its
hair
from
its
eyes
i
saw
it
was
a
monkey
that
anguished
and
fearful
gaze
which
met
mine
was
of
my
own
tiny
brother
it
was
a
rare
and
creature
the
hairy
saki
the
first
of
its
kind
i
had
seen
the
native
took
it
away
to
eat
it
i
may
say
that
at
every
camp
we
ate
what
we
could
get
and
being
by
nature
squeamish
i
never
asked
what
it
was
that
was
put
before
me
whatever
it
was
there
it
was
and
it
was
all
they
could
give
me
i
only
emphatically
directed
that
monkey
flesh
would
be
worse
to
me
than
hunger
there
are
plenty
of
tigers
about
here
called
one
of
our
hosts
to
me
i
ll
fix
you
with
a
gun
and
we
ll
have
some
but
thank
you
no
i
did
not
carry
arms
throughout
my
journey
the
jaguars
did
me
no
hurt
when
i
went
exploring
o
mornings
and
as
for
me
i
was
not
looking
for
trouble
quite
politely
the
jaguars
retired
while
i
wandered
about
alone
though
i
should
have
been
delighted
to
have
sighted
one
the
whiffs
of
feral
odour
i
got
especially
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mules
about
which
the
jaguars
prowled
at
night
were
my
only
big
game
trophies
sometimes
an
indistinguishable
object
would
step
across
ahead
of
me
or
stir
in
a
bush
close
by
drawing
ear
and
eye
at
once
in
a
place
where
trees
and
leaves
were
always
as
fixtures
like
the
air
i
never
met
one
of
the
larger
natives
of
the
place
i
knew
the
parrots
by
their
voices
i
heard
and
smelt
the
cats
the
monkeys
called
from
a
great
distance
or
a
body
would
slip
round
a
tree
so
like
a
shadow
moving
that
when
i
examined
the
place
and
saw
nothing
it
was
easy
to
believe
the
eye
was
only
suspicious
the
men
began
to
talk
of
the
indians
they
said
we
were
in
the
land
of
the
caripunas
you
won
t
see
them
said
hill
i
expect
they
are
watching
us
now
though
he
added
after
a
pause
i
glanced
up
with
some
interest
at
the
spectral
foliage
where
right
before
me
the
pale
moonfire
on
leaves
and
trunks
framed
portals
in
the
night
i
could
see
nothing
it
s
odds
that
some
of
them
have
been
following
us
all
day
continued
hill
they
watch
us
they
can
t
make
us
out
the
rubber
men
told
us
the
caripunas
would
kill
and
eat
us
they
kill
the
rubber
men
all
right
and
a
good
job
too
but
they
only
slip
through
the
forest
watching
us
i
saw
some
once
on
the
jaci
i
jollied
them
into
putting
their
canoe
ashore
it
was
only
a
bark
contraption
the
roughest
thing
of
its
kind
i
ve
seen
sharpened
fore
and
aft
by
lacing
the
ends
together
with
sinews
they
were
fine
light
brown
fellows
well
made
and
stark
naked
the
black
hair
of
some
of
them
was
frizzy
curious
isn
t
it
but
i
ve
heard
that
in
the
slave
days
runaway
niggers
got
down
here
and
the
forest
indians
collared
them
to
improve
their
own
miserable
stock
the
brazilians
have
always
had
a
tradition
of
a
race
on
the
madeira
and
here
they
are
they
had
bows
and
arrows
those
chaps
made
entirely
of
cane
and
wood
the
arrows
were
tipped
with
macaw
feathers
and
were
over
six
feet
long
i
couldn
t
bend
the
bloomin
bow
these
fellows
keep
to
the
side
rivers
and
their
villages
are
always
hidden
in
the
woods
it
s
a
funny
thing
but
whenever
the
surveyors
come
on
a
village
they
find
it
has
been
vacated
about
a
we
were
silent
for
a
time
and
then
a
crept
up
to
a
hammock
and
spoke
in
spanish
to
the
doctor
the
doctor
laughed
and
the
fellow
went
away
he
s
asking
for
a
piece
of
that
onca
to
eat
he
says
it
will
make
him
they
began
to
talk
of
that
and
the
talk
went
on
to
what
the
indians
say
of
the
mai
d
aqua
the
mother
of
the
waters
who
frequents
islands
in
the
rivers
and
is
the
ruin
of
young
men
and
of
such
dreads
as
the
jurupari
and
the
curupira
and
the
maty
tapéré
they
admitted
it
was
easy
to
imagine
such
things
into
the
forest
it
wasn
t
what
was
seen
there
only
the
trees
and
the
shadows
were
seen
but
sometimes
there
were
sounds
one
of
us
when
alone
making
a
traverse
in
the
forest
had
heard
a
scream
as
if
a
woman
had
been
frightened
and
then
there
was
no
more
sound
the
camp
doctor
began
to
talk
he
was
an
englishman
he
sat
upright
in
the
middle
of
his
hammock
swinging
it
with
one
foot
there
was
a
curious
yarn
i
heard
about
a
tiger
in
hampshire
ah
hampshire
i
had
a
practice
there
once
you
know
it
made
me
so
busy
and
popular
that
at
last
i
began
to
wonder
whether
i
wasn
t
altogether
too
successful
it
was
the
practice
or
me
as
i
wanted
to
live
on
and
do
some
useful
work
i
slew
the
practice
i
ve
got
one
or
two
ideas
about
that
you
chaps
die
of
here
a
doctor
can
not
serve
god
and
a
lot
of
old
women
with
colds
oh
yes
about
that
tiger
well
one
of
those
travelling
shows
came
to
our
village
i
could
see
the
steam
of
its
roundabout
engines
from
my
surgery
windows
and
i
told
the
farmer
who
rented
the
field
to
the
showmen
that
if
he
let
a
mechanical
organ
come
anywhere
near
my
place
again
he
could
take
his
gallstone
somewhere
else
in
future
late
one
night
i
got
an
urgent
message
to
go
over
to
the
show
there
had
been
an
accident
i
was
taken
into
a
caravan
there
was
a
fat
woman
dressed
as
a
pink
fairy
kneeling
over
a
man
stretched
on
a
bunk
shaking
him
and
crying
the
man
was
dead
all
right
but
i
couldn
t
find
a
mark
on
him
diseased
heart
i
supposed
but
he
looked
a
good
un
some
of
the
powerful
chaps
have
most
unreliable
hearts
the
woman
kept
crying
out
something
about
that
beast
of
a
curious
sort
of
remark
and
i
asked
the
boss
afterwards
what
she
meant
he
shuffled
about
a
bit
pretending
that
she
was
talking
silly
nothing
to
do
with
the
tigress
he
said
although
the
man
was
found
unconscious
in
her
it
s
such
a
tame
thing
said
the
showman
anybody
could
handle
it
never
shows
vice
old
jackson
was
the
dead
he
d
been
inside
tinkering
with
a
partition
when
we
found
him
she
was
lying
in
a
corner
as
if
asleep
and
only
sat
up
and
yawned
when
we
got
him
out
of
her
cage
come
and
see
for
i
went
there
was
nothing
to
see
except
a
tigress
sitting
up
in
a
corner
of
her
cage
blinking
at
the
lantern
and
looking
rather
spooky
a
rather
small
creature
and
prettily
of
the
melantic
variety
well
the
chap
was
buried
after
an
inquest
and
that
inquest
made
me
ask
a
lot
of
questions
afterwards
it
was
a
simple
affair
the
inquest
death
from
natural
causes
but
there
was
something
behind
the
evidence
of
the
man
s
wife
and
i
wanted
to
find
out
about
that
she
told
me
she
had
a
little
girl
who
got
one
night
into
the
tent
where
the
big
cats
were
kept
nobody
was
there
at
the
time
next
morning
she
said
to
her
mother
mummie
who
was
the
funny
lady
in
lucy
s
cage
lucy
was
the
name
of
the
tigress
the
child
said
that
there
was
only
the
lady
in
the
cage
and
the
lady
watched
her
and
that
was
all
they
could
get
out
of
the
kiddie
the
funny
thing
about
it
is
that
once
before
the
child
had
come
back
with
a
yarn
like
that
after
straying
into
the
menagerie
tent
late
at
night
the
wife
s
idea
was
her
husband
had
died
of
fright
don
t
ask
me
what
i
want
to
make
out
boys
i
m
only
just
telling
you
the
yarn
there
you
are
well
before
the
show
left
our
village
i
heard
they
d
got
a
nigger
to
look
after
the
big
cats
he
was
with
the
show
two
days
on
the
third
day
he
was
missing
he
went
without
drawing
his
money
and
he
had
left
open
the
door
of
lucy
s
cage
she
hadn
t
attempted
to
get
out
the
nigger
was
found
some
days
after
wandering
about
the
country
and
a
little
cracked
by
all
accounts
and
that
s
the
doctor
struck
a
match
and
then
hoisted
his
legs
into
the
hammock
somewhere
far
in
the
forest
the
monkeys
were
howling
that
doctor
is
a
good
body
mender
said
hill
to
me
he
is
the
most
entertaining
liar
on
this
vi
when
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
girau
falls
we
returned
to
a
camp
known
as
which
was
merely
a
couple
of
huts
the
station
of
two
english
surveyors
who
had
with
them
a
small
party
of
bolivians
the
bolivian
frontier
was
then
but
a
little
distance
to
the
we
rested
for
a
day
there
and
planned
to
make
a
journey
of
ten
miles
across
country
to
the
falls
of
the
caldeirao
do
inferno
by
doing
so
we
should
save
the
wearying
return
ride
along
the
track
to
the
rio
for
at
the
caldeirao
a
launch
was
kept
and
in
that
we
could
shoot
the
rapids
and
reach
the
camp
on
the
jaci
two
days
earlier
some
haste
was
necessary
now
for
my
steamer
must
be
nearing
her
sailing
time
and
again
i
agreed
the
more
readily
to
the
plan
of
making
a
traverse
of
the
forest
because
it
would
give
me
the
opportunity
of
seeing
the
interior
of
the
virgin
jungle
away
from
any
track
though
i
had
been
so
long
in
a
land
which
all
was
forest
i
had
not
been
within
the
universal
growth
except
for
little
journeys
on
used
trails
a
journey
across
country
in
the
amazon
country
is
never
made
by
the
brazilians
the
only
roads
are
the
rivers
it
is
a
rare
traveller
who
goes
through
those
forests
guided
only
by
a
compass
and
his
lore
of
the
wilderness
that
for
months
i
had
never
been
out
of
sight
of
the
jungle
and
yet
had
rarely
ventured
to
turn
aside
from
a
path
for
more
than
a
few
paces
is
some
indication
of
its
character
at
the
camp
where
we
were
staying
i
was
told
that
once
a
man
had
gone
merely
within
the
screen
of
leaves
and
then
no
doubt
had
lost
for
a
few
moments
his
sense
of
direction
of
the
camp
for
he
was
never
seen
again
the
equatorial
forest
is
popularly
pictured
as
a
place
of
bright
and
varied
colours
with
extravagant
flowers
an
abundance
of
fruits
and
huge
trees
hung
with
creepers
where
lurk
many
venomous
but
beautiful
snakes
with
eyes
and
a
multitude
of
birds
as
bright
as
the
flowers
paradise
indeed
though
haunted
by
a
peril
those
details
are
right
but
the
picture
is
wrong
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
birds
are
decorated
in
a
way
which
makes
the
most
beautiful
of
our
temperate
birds
seem
dull
but
the
toucans
and
macaws
of
the
madeira
forest
though
common
are
not
often
seen
and
when
they
are
seen
they
are
likely
to
be
but
obscure
atoms
drifting
high
in
a
white
light
about
the
villages
and
in
the
clearings
there
are
usually
many
superb
butterflies
and
moths
and
a
varied
wealth
of
vegetation
not
to
be
matched
outside
the
tropics
and
there
will
be
the
fireflies
and
odours
in
evening
pathways
but
the
virgin
forest
itself
soon
becomes
but
a
green
monotony
which
through
extent
and
mystery
dominates
and
compels
to
awe
and
some
dread
you
will
see
it
daily
but
will
not
often
approach
it
it
has
no
splendid
blossoms
none
that
is
which
you
will
see
except
by
chance
as
by
luck
one
day
i
saw
from
the
steamer
s
bridge
some
trees
in
blossom
domes
of
lilac
surmounting
the
forest
levels
trees
are
always
in
blossom
there
for
it
is
a
land
of
continuous
high
summer
and
there
are
orchids
always
in
flower
and
palms
and
vines
that
fill
acres
of
forest
with
fragrance
palms
and
other
trees
which
give
wine
and
delicious
fruits
and
somewhere
hidden
there
are
the
birds
of
the
tropical
picture
and
dappled
jaguars
perfect
in
colouring
and
form
and
brown
men
and
women
who
have
strange
gods
but
they
are
lost
in
the
ocean
of
leaves
as
are
the
pearls
and
wonders
in
the
deep
you
will
remember
the
equatorial
forest
but
as
a
gloom
of
foliage
in
which
all
else
that
showed
was
rare
and
momentary
was
foundered
and
lost
to
sight
instantly
as
an
unusual
ray
of
coloured
light
in
one
wave
gleams
and
at
once
goes
and
your
surprise
at
its
apparition
fades
too
and
again
there
is
but
the
empty
desolation
which
is
for
ever
but
vastness
sombrely
bright
one
morning
wondering
greatly
what
we
should
see
in
the
place
where
we
should
be
the
first
men
to
go
hill
and
i
left
camp
and
returned
a
little
along
the
track
it
was
a
hot
still
morning
a
vanilla
vine
was
in
fragrant
flower
somewhere
unseen
but
unescapable
my
little
unknown
friend
in
the
woods
who
calls
me
at
odd
i
think
chiefly
when
i
am
near
a
whistling
thrice
let
me
know
he
was
about
hill
said
he
thinks
he
has
seen
him
and
that
my
little
friend
looks
like
a
blackbird
on
the
track
in
many
places
were
objects
which
appeared
to
be
long
cups
inverted
of
unglazed
ware
picking
up
one
i
found
it
was
the
cap
to
a
mine
of
ants
the
inside
of
the
clay
cup
being
hollowed
in
a
perfect
circle
and
remarkably
smooth
a
paca
dived
into
the
scrub
near
us
it
was
early
morning
scented
with
vanilla
and
the
intricacy
of
leaves
was
radiant
nowhere
in
the
screen
could
i
see
a
place
through
which
it
was
possible
to
crawl
to
whatever
was
behind
it
the
front
of
leaves
was
unbroken
hill
presently
bent
double
and
disappeared
and
i
followed
in
the
break
he
made
so
we
went
for
about
ten
minutes
my
leader
cutting
obstructions
with
his
machete
and
mostly
we
had
to
go
almost
on
hands
and
knees
the
undergrowth
was
green
but
in
the
etiolated
way
of
plants
which
have
little
light
though
that
may
have
been
my
fancy
one
plant
was
very
common
making
feathery
barriers
i
think
it
was
a
climbing
bamboo
its
stem
was
vapid
and
of
no
diameter
and
its
grasslike
leaves
grew
in
whorls
at
the
joints
it
extended
to
incredible
distances
we
got
out
of
that
margin
of
undergrowth
which
springs
up
quickly
when
light
is
let
into
the
woods
as
it
was
there
through
the
cutting
of
the
track
and
found
ourselves
on
a
bare
floor
where
the
trunks
of
arborescent
laurels
grew
so
thickly
together
that
our
view
ahead
was
restricted
to
a
few
yards
we
were
in
the
forest
there
was
a
pale
tinge
of
day
but
its
origin
was
uncertain
for
overhead
no
foliage
could
be
seen
but
only
deep
shadows
from
which
long
ropes
were
hanging
without
life
in
that
obscurity
were
points
of
light
as
if
a
high
roof
had
lost
some
tiles
hill
set
a
course
almost
due
south
and
we
went
on
presently
descending
to
a
deep
clear
stream
over
which
a
tree
had
fallen
shafts
of
daylight
came
down
to
us
there
making
the
sandy
bottom
of
the
stream
luminous
as
by
a
lantern
and
betraying
crowds
of
small
fishes
as
we
climbed
the
tree
to
cross
upon
it
we
disturbed
several
morphos
we
had
difficulties
beyond
in
a
hollow
where
the
bottom
of
the
forest
was
lumbered
with
fallen
trees
dry
rubbish
and
thorns
and
once
stepping
on
what
looked
timber
solid
enough
its
treacherous
shell
collapsed
and
i
went
down
into
a
cloud
of
dust
and
ants
in
clearing
this
wreckage
which
was
usually
as
high
as
our
faces
and
doubly
confused
by
the
darkness
the
involutions
of
dead
thorny
creepers
and
clouds
of
dried
foliage
hills
got
at
fault
with
our
direction
but
reassured
himself
though
i
don
t
know
i
think
with
the
certain
knowledge
that
if
we
went
south
long
enough
we
should
strike
the
madeira
on
we
went
for
hours
we
continued
among
the
trees
seldom
knowing
what
was
ahead
of
us
for
any
distance
surviving
points
of
noise
intruding
again
after
long
in
the
dusk
of
limbo
so
still
and
nocturnal
was
the
forest
that
it
was
real
only
when
its
forms
were
close
all
else
was
phantom
and
of
the
shades
there
was
not
a
green
sign
of
life
and
not
a
sound
resting
once
under
a
tree
i
began
to
think
there
was
a
conspiracy
implied
in
that
murk
and
awful
stillness
and
that
we
should
never
come
out
again
into
the
day
and
see
a
living
earth
hills
sat
looking
out
and
said
as
if
in
answer
to
an
unspoken
thought
of
mine
which
had
been
heard
because
there
was
less
than
no
sound
there
that
men
who
were
lost
in
those
woods
soon
went
mad
then
he
led
on
again
this
forest
was
nothing
like
the
paradise
a
tropical
wild
is
supposed
to
be
it
was
as
uniformly
dingy
as
the
old
stones
of
a
london
street
on
a
november
evening
we
did
not
see
a
movement
except
when
the
morphos
started
from
the
uprooted
tree
once
i
heard
the
whistle
call
us
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
urgent
and
startling
and
now
when
in
a
london
i
hear
a
boy
call
his
mate
in
a
shrill
whistle
it
puts
about
me
again
the
spectral
aisles
and
that
unexpectant
quiet
of
the
sepulchre
which
is
more
than
mere
absence
of
sound
for
the
dead
who
should
have
no
voice
this
central
forest
was
really
the
vault
of
the
dank
mouldering
dark
abandoned
to
the
accumulations
of
eld
and
decay
the
tall
pillars
rose
upholding
night
and
they
might
have
been
bastions
of
weathered
limestone
and
basalt
for
they
were
as
grim
as
ancient
and
ruinous
masonry
there
was
no
undergrowth
the
ground
was
hidden
in
a
ruin
of
perished
stuff
uprooted
trees
parchments
of
leaves
broken
boughs
and
mummied
husks
the
iron
globes
of
nuts
and
pods
there
was
no
day
but
some
breaks
in
the
roof
were
points
of
remote
starlight
the
crowded
columns
mounted
straight
and
far
almost
branchless
fading
into
indistinction
out
of
that
overhead
obscurity
hung
a
wreckage
of
distorted
cables
binding
the
trees
and
often
reaching
the
ground
the
trees
were
seldom
of
great
girth
though
occasionally
there
was
a
dominant
basaltic
pillar
its
roots
meandering
over
the
floor
like
streams
of
old
lava
the
smooth
ridges
of
such
a
fantastic
complexity
of
roots
were
sometimes
breast
high
the
walls
ran
up
the
trunk
projecting
from
it
as
flat
buttresses
for
great
heights
we
would
crawl
round
such
an
occupying
structure
diminished
groundlings
as
one
would
move
about
the
base
of
a
foreboding
plutonic
building
whose
limits
and
meaning
were
ominous
and
baffling
there
were
other
great
trees
with
compound
boles
built
literally
of
bundles
of
round
stems
intricate
gothic
pillars
some
of
the
props
having
fused
in
places
every
tree
was
the
support
of
a
parasitic
community
lianas
swathing
it
and
binding
it
one
vine
moulded
itself
to
its
host
a
flat
and
wide
compress
as
though
it
were
plastic
we
might
have
been
witnessing
what
had
been
a
riot
of
manifold
and
insurgent
life
it
had
been
turned
to
stone
when
in
the
extreme
pose
of
striving
violence
it
was
all
dead
now
but
what
if
these
combatants
had
only
paused
as
we
appeared
it
was
a
thought
which
came
to
me
the
pause
might
be
but
an
appearance
for
our
deception
indeed
they
were
all
fighting
as
we
passed
through
those
still
and
fantastic
shapes
a
war
ruthless
but
slow
in
which
the
battle
day
was
ages
long
they
seemed
but
still
we
were
deceived
if
time
had
been
accelerated
if
the
movements
in
that
war
of
phantoms
had
been
speeded
we
should
have
seen
what
really
was
there
the
greater
trees
running
upwards
to
starve
the
weak
of
light
and
food
and
heard
the
continuous
collapse
of
the
failures
and
have
seen
the
lianas
writhing
and
constricting
manifestly
like
serpents
throttling
and
eating
their
hosts
we
did
see
the
dead
everywhere
shells
with
the
worms
at
them
yet
it
was
not
easy
to
be
sure
that
we
saw
anything
at
all
for
these
were
not
trees
but
shapes
in
a
region
below
the
day
a
world
sunk
abysmally
from
the
land
of
living
things
to
which
light
but
thinly
percolated
down
to
two
travellers
moving
over
its
floor
trying
to
get
out
to
their
own
place
late
in
the
afternoon
we
were
surprised
by
a
steep
hill
in
our
way
where
the
forest
was
more
open
palms
became
conspicuous
on
the
slopes
and
the
interior
of
the
sombre
woods
was
lighted
with
bright
and
graceful
foliage
the
wild
banana
was
frequent
its
long
rippling
pennants
showing
everywhere
the
hill
rose
sharply
perhaps
for
six
hundred
feet
and
over
its
surface
were
scattered
large
stones
and
stones
are
rare
indeed
in
this
land
of
vegetable
humus
they
were
often
six
inches
in
diameter
and
i
should
have
said
they
were
waterworn
but
that
i
had
seen
them
at
one
camp
where
they
occurred
but
little
below
the
surface
in
a
friable
sandstone
the
largest
of
them
easily
broken
in
the
hand
for
they
were
but
ferrous
concretions
of
quartz
grains
after
exposure
to
the
air
they
so
hardened
that
they
could
be
fractured
only
with
difficulty
we
kept
along
the
ridge
of
the
hill
finding
breaks
in
the
forest
through
which
as
through
unexpected
windows
we
could
see
for
a
wonder
over
the
roof
of
the
forest
looking
out
of
our
prison
to
a
wide
world
where
the
sun
was
declining
in
the
we
caught
the
gleam
of
the
madeira
and
beyond
it
saw
a
continuation
of
the
range
of
hills
on
which
we
stood
in
the
low
ground
between
the
hill
range
and
the
river
the
forest
was
lower
and
was
so
tangled
a
mass
that
i
doubted
whether
we
could
make
a
way
through
it
we
happened
upon
a
deserted
caripuna
village
three
large
sheds
without
sides
each
but
a
ragged
thatch
propped
on
four
legs
the
clearing
was
just
large
enough
to
hold
them
i
could
find
no
relics
of
the
forest
folk
about
damp
leaves
were
thick
on
the
floor
of
each
shelter
but
it
was
lucky
we
found
the
huts
for
thence
a
trail
led
us
to
the
river
we
emerged
suddenly
from
the
forest
just
as
one
goes
through
a
little
door
into
the
open
street
we
were
on
the
bank
of
the
madeira
by
the
upper
falls
of
the
caldeirao
it
was
still
a
great
river
with
the
wall
of
the
forest
opposite
just
above
which
the
sunset
was
flaming
so
far
away
that
its
tree
trunks
were
but
vertical
lines
of
silver
in
dark
cliffs
a
track
used
by
the
bolivian
rubber
boatmen
led
us
down
stream
to
the
camp
by
the
lower
falls
it
was
night
when
we
got
to
the
three
huts
of
the
camp
and
the
river
could
not
be
seen
but
it
was
heard
a
continuous
low
thundering
sometimes
a
greater
shock
of
deep
waters
falling
an
orgasm
of
the
flood
pouring
unseen
more
violent
than
the
rest
made
the
earth
tremulous
men
held
up
lanterns
to
our
faces
and
led
us
to
a
hut
it
was
but
the
usual
roof
of
leaves
we
rested
in
hammocks
slung
between
the
posts
and
i
ached
in
every
limb
but
here
we
were
at
last
and
there
is
no
more
luxurious
bed
than
a
hammock
yielding
and
resilient
as
though
you
were
cradled
on
air
and
there
is
no
pipe
like
that
smoked
in
a
hammock
at
night
in
the
tropics
after
a
day
of
toil
and
anxiety
in
a
dissolving
heat
for
the
heat
makes
a
pipe
bitter
and
impossible
but
if
a
tropic
night
is
cool
and
cloudless
it
comes
like
a
benediction
and
the
silence
is
a
peace
that
is
below
you
and
around
and
as
high
as
the
stars
towards
which
your
face
is
turned
the
ropes
of
the
hammock
creaked
sometimes
a
man
spoke
quietly
as
though
he
were
at
a
great
distance
the
sound
of
the
water
receded
was
heard
only
as
in
a
sleep
and
it
might
have
been
the
loud
murmur
of
the
spinning
globe
heard
because
we
had
left
this
world
and
had
leisure
for
trifles
in
a
securer
world
apart
in
the
morning
while
they
prepared
the
little
steam
launch
for
its
journey
down
the
rapids
i
had
time
to
climb
about
the
smooth
granite
boulders
of
the
foreshore
below
the
hut
a
rock
is
so
unusual
in
this
country
that
it
is
a
luxury
when
found
the
granite
was
bare
but
in
its
crevices
grew
cacti
and
other
plants
with
fleshy
leaves
and
swollen
stems
shadowing
the
hut
was
a
tree
bearing
flowers
and
before
the
blossoms
humming
birds
were
hovering
glowing
and
evanescent
morsels
remaining
miraculously
suspended
when
inserting
their
long
bills
into
the
flowers
their
little
wings
beating
so
rapidly
that
the
air
seemed
visible
and
radiant
about
them
another
tree
here
interested
me
for
it
was
bates
assacu
the
only
one
i
saw
it
was
a
large
tree
with
palmate
leaves
having
seven
fingers
ugly
spines
studded
even
its
brown
trunk
i
looked
out
on
the
river
dubiously
a
rocky
island
was
just
off
shore
crowned
with
trees
between
us
and
the
island
and
beyond
the
waters
heaved
and
circled
evidently
of
great
depth
and
fearfully
disturbed
and
swift
it
looked
all
its
name
the
caldeirao
do
s
cauldron
there
was
not
much
white
and
broken
water
but
its
surface
was
always
changing
whirlpools
forming
and
revolving
then
disappearing
in
long
wrenched
strands
of
water
sometimes
a
big
tree
would
leap
out
of
the
water
as
though
it
had
travelled
upwards
from
the
bottom
and
then
would
vanish
again
we
set
out
upon
it
with
an
engineman
and
two
and
went
off
obliquely
for
the
engineman
and
navigator
was
a
german
if
the
river
had
been
sane
and
usual
i
should
have
had
my
eyes
on
the
forest
which
stood
along
each
shore
for
few
white
men
had
ever
looked
upon
it
but
the
river
took
our
minds
and
never
in
bad
weather
in
the
western
ocean
have
i
seen
water
so
full
of
menace
yet
below
the
falls
it
was
silent
and
unbroken
it
was
its
smooth
swiftness
its
strange
checks
and
mysterious
and
deep
convulsions
as
though
the
river
bed
itself
was
insecure
the
startling
whirlpools
which
appeared
without
warning
circling
depressions
on
the
surface
in
which
our
launch
would
have
been
but
a
straw
which
shocked
the
mind
it
was
stealthy
and
noiseless
the
water
was
but
an
inch
or
two
below
our
gunwale
we
saw
trees
afloat
greater
and
heavier
than
our
midget
of
a
craft
shooting
down
the
gently
inclined
shining
expanse
just
as
we
were
and
express
and
then
as
if
an
awful
hand
had
grasped
them
from
below
they
were
pulled
under
and
we
saw
them
no
more
or
again
and
near
to
us
and
ahead
a
tree
bole
would
shoot
from
below
like
an
arrow
though
no
tree
had
been
drifting
there
the
shores
were
far
away
the
water
ahead
grew
worse
the
german
crouched
by
his
little
throbbing
engine
looking
could
see
his
fixed
the
bows
we
were
travelling
indeed
now
the
boat
in
a
rapid
tremor
and
oscillating
violently
was
clutched
at
the
keel
by
something
which
coiled
strongly
about
us
gripped
us
and
held
us
and
the
boat
mad
and
terrified
in
an
effort
to
escape
made
a
circuit
the
water
lipping
at
her
gunwale
and
coming
over
the
bows
the
river
seemed
poised
a
foot
above
the
bows
ready
to
pour
in
and
swamp
us
the
german
tried
to
get
her
head
down
stream
hills
began
tearing
at
his
ammunition
belt
and
i
stooped
and
tugged
at
my
boot
laces
the
boat
jumped
as
if
released
the
german
turned
round
on
us
grinning
it
ees
all
right
he
said
he
began
to
roll
a
cigarette
nervously
we
pull
it
off
all
right
said
the
german
wetting
his
cigarette
paper
the
boat
was
free
dancing
lightly
along
the
little
engine
was
singing
quickly
and
freely
the
madeira
here
was
as
wide
as
in
its
lower
reaches
with
many
islands
there
were
hosts
of
waterfowl
we
landed
once
at
a
rubber
hunter
s
sitio
on
the
right
bank
its
owner
a
bolivian
and
his
pretty
indian
wife
who
had
tattoo
marks
on
her
forehead
made
much
of
us
and
gave
us
coffee
they
had
an
orchard
of
guavas
and
there
for
it
was
long
since
i
had
tasted
fruit
i
was
an
immoderate
thief
in
spite
of
a
pet
curassow
which
followed
me
through
the
garden
with
distracting
pecks
the
rio
a
blackwater
stream
opened
up
soon
after
we
left
the
sitio
the
boundary
between
the
flood
of
the
madeira
and
the
dark
water
of
the
tributary
was
straight
and
distinct
from
a
distance
the
black
water
seemed
like
ink
but
we
found
it
quite
clear
and
bright
the
jaci
is
not
an
important
branch
river
but
it
was
at
this
period
of
the
rains
wider
than
the
thames
at
richmond
and
without
doubt
very
much
deeper
the
appearance
of
the
forest
on
the
jaci
was
quite
different
from
the
palisades
of
the
parent
stream
on
the
madeira
there
is
commonly
a
narrow
shelf
of
bank
above
which
the
jungle
rises
as
would
a
sheer
cliff
the
jaci
had
no
banks
the
forest
was
deeply
submerged
on
either
side
and
whenever
an
opening
showed
in
the
woods
we
could
see
the
waters
within
but
could
not
see
their
extent
because
of
the
interior
gloom
the
outer
foliage
was
awash
and
mounted
not
straight
but
in
rounded
clouds
for
the
first
time
i
saw
many
vines
and
trees
in
flower
presumably
because
we
were
nearer
the
roof
of
the
woods
one
tree
was
loaded
with
the
pendent
nests
of
those
birds
called
hang
nests
and
scores
of
the
beauties
in
their
black
and
gold
plumage
were
busy
about
their
homes
which
resembled
monstrous
fruits
another
tree
was
weighted
with
large
racemes
of
blossoms
but
as
the
launch
passed
close
to
it
we
discovered
the
blooms
were
really
bundles
of
caterpillars
the
jaci
appeared
to
be
a
haunt
of
the
alligators
but
all
we
saw
of
them
was
their
snouts
which
moved
over
the
surface
of
the
water
out
of
our
way
like
rubber
balls
afloat
and
mysteriously
propelled
i
had
a
sight
too
of
that
most
regal
of
the
eagles
the
harpy
for
one
well
within
view
lifted
from
a
tree
ahead
and
sailed
finely
over
the
river
and
away
that
night
i
slept
again
in
my
old
hut
at
the
jaci
camp
and
with
hill
and
another
official
set
off
early
next
morning
for
the
construction
camp
on
rio
caracoles
which
we
hoped
to
reach
before
the
commissary
train
left
for
porto
velho
at
porto
velho
the
capella
was
and
i
wished
perhaps
as
much
as
i
have
ever
wished
for
anything
that
i
should
not
be
left
behind
when
she
departed
i
knew
she
must
be
on
the
point
of
sailing
my
two
companions
had
reasons
of
their
own
for
thinking
the
catching
of
that
train
was
urgently
necessary
in
our
minds
we
were
already
settled
and
safe
in
a
waggon
comfortable
among
the
empty
boxes
going
back
to
the
place
where
the
crowd
was
but
still
we
had
some
way
to
ride
and
i
must
tell
you
i
was
now
possessed
of
all
i
desired
of
the
tropical
forest
and
had
but
one
fixed
idea
in
my
dark
mind
but
one
bright
star
shining
there
i
had
turned
about
and
was
going
home
and
now
must
follow
hard
and
unswervingly
that
star
in
the
east
of
my
mind
the
rhythmic
movements
of
the
mule
under
my
legs
knew
he
was
in
my
darkened
mind
a
refrain
get
out
of
it
get
out
of
it
and
at
last
there
were
the
huts
and
tents
of
the
caracoles
still
and
quiet
under
the
vertical
sun
no
train
was
there
nor
did
it
look
a
place
for
trains
my
steamer
was
sixty
miles
away
beyond
a
track
along
which
further
riding
was
impossible
and
where
walking
for
more
than
two
miles
could
not
be
even
considered
the
train
the
boys
told
us
blithely
went
back
half
an
hour
before
the
audience
of
trees
regarded
my
consternation
with
the
indifference
which
i
had
begun
to
hate
with
some
passion
the
boys
naturally
expected
that
we
should
take
it
in
the
right
way
for
hot
climates
without
fuss
and
that
now
they
had
some
new
gossip
for
the
night
but
they
should
have
understood
hill
better
my
tall
gaunt
leader
waved
them
aside
for
he
was
a
man
who
could
do
things
when
there
seemed
nothing
that
one
could
do
the
terminus
or
bust
he
cried
where
s
the
boss
he
demanded
a
handcart
and
a
crew
i
thought
he
spoke
in
jest
a
handcart
is
a
contrivance
propelled
along
railway
metals
by
pumping
at
a
handle
the
handle
connects
with
the
wheels
by
a
crank
and
cogs
through
a
slot
in
the
centre
of
the
platform
and
you
get
five
miles
an
hour
out
of
it
while
the
crew
continues
for
sixty
miles
in
that
heat
it
was
impossible
yet
hill
persisted
the
cart
was
put
on
the
metals
five
manned
the
pump
handle
three
facing
the
track
ahead
two
with
their
backs
to
it
we
three
passengers
sat
on
the
sides
and
front
of
the
trolley
away
we
went
the
boys
cheered
and
laughed
calling
out
to
us
the
probabilities
of
our
journey
we
trundled
round
a
corner
and
already
i
had
to
change
my
cramped
position
miles
to
go
we
sat
with
our
legs
held
up
out
of
the
way
of
the
vines
and
rocks
by
the
track
and
careful
to
remember
that
our
craniums
must
be
kept
clear
of
the
pump
handle
the
crew
went
up
and
down
with
fixed
looks
the
sun
was
the
eye
of
the
last
judgment
and
my
lips
were
cracked
the
trees
made
no
sign
the
natives
went
up
and
down
and
the
forest
went
by
tree
by
tree
my
tired
and
thoughtless
legs
dropped
and
a
thorn
fastened
its
teeth
instantly
in
my
boots
and
nearly
had
me
down
the
trees
went
by
one
by
one
there
was
a
large
black
and
yellow
butterfly
on
a
stone
near
us
i
was
surprised
when
no
sound
came
as
it
made
a
grand
movement
upwards
then
in
the
heart
of
nowhere
the
trolley
slackened
and
came
to
a
stand
we
had
lost
a
pin
half
a
mile
back
we
could
hardly
credit
we
really
had
found
that
pin
but
there
it
was
and
the
men
began
to
go
up
and
down
again
hill
got
a
touch
of
fever
and
the
natives
had
changed
to
the
colour
of
impure
tallow
and
flung
their
perspiration
on
my
face
and
hands
as
they
swung
mechanically
the
poor
wretches
we
were
done
the
sun
weighed
untold
tons
but
the
sun
declined
some
monkeys
began
to
howl
and
the
sunset
tempest
sprang
down
on
us
its
assault
shaking
the
high
screens
on
either
hand
and
the
rain
beat
with
the
roll
of
then
we
got
on
an
up
grade
and
two
of
the
spent
natives
collapsed
their
chests
heaving
so
i
and
the
other
chap
stood
up
in
the
night
looked
to
the
stars
from
which
no
help
could
be
got
took
hold
of
the
pump
handle
like
gallant
gentlemen
and
tried
to
forget
there
were
twenty
miles
to
go
away
we
went
jog
jog
uphill
i
thought
that
gradient
would
not
end
till
my
heart
and
head
had
burst
but
it
did
just
in
time
we
gathered
speed
on
a
down
grade
we
flew
presently
the
man
with
the
fever
yelled
the
brake
the
brake
but
the
brake
was
broken
the
trolley
was
not
running
but
leaping
in
the
dark
every
time
it
came
down
it
found
the
metals
a
light
was
coming
towards
us
on
the
line
and
the
others
prepared
to
jump
i
could
not
even
see
that
light
for
my
back
was
turned
to
our
direction
and
i
could
not
let
go
the
flying
handle
else
would
all
control
have
gone
and
also
i
should
have
been
smashed
i
shut
my
eyes
pumped
swiftly
and
involuntarily
and
waited
for
doom
to
hit
me
in
the
back
the
blow
was
a
long
time
coming
then
hill
s
gentle
voice
remarked
all
right
boys
it
s
a
i
became
only
a
piece
of
machinery
and
pumped
and
pumped
with
no
more
feeling
than
a
bolster
shadows
undulated
by
us
everlastingly
i
think
my
tongue
was
hanging
out
lights
were
really
seen
at
last
kind
hands
lifted
us
from
the
engine
of
torture
and
i
heard
the
remembered
voice
of
the
skipper
is
he
there
i
thought
it
was
a
that
night
of
my
return
a
full
moon
and
a
placid
river
showed
me
the
capella
doubled
as
in
a
mirror
and
admiring
the
steamer
s
deep
inverted
shape
i
saw
a
heartening
saw
steam
escaping
from
the
funnel
which
was
upside
down
a
great
joy
filled
me
at
that
and
i
turned
to
the
skipper
as
we
strode
over
the
ties
of
the
jetty
yes
we
go
home
he
said
the
bunk
was
again
by
the
engine
room
but
knowing
the
glad
reason
i
endured
it
with
pleasure
we
turned
about
yet
on
the
morrow
there
was
still
the
persistence
of
the
spacious
idleness
which
encompassed
us
impregnably
beyond
which
we
could
not
go
the
little
that
was
left
of
the
fuel
in
the
holds
went
out
of
us
with
dismal
unhaste
the
skipper
and
the
mates
fumed
and
the
doctor
took
me
round
to
see
the
capella
s
pets
so
that
we
might
fill
up
time
a
monkey
an
entirely
secular
creature
once
with
us
had
died
while
i
was
away
it
was
well
he
had
no
name
vice
was
his
name
there
were
no
tears
at
his
death
and
tinker
the
terrier
began
to
get
back
some
of
his
full
and
lively
form
again
after
that
day
when
in
a
sudden
righteous
revolution
he
slew
and
barbarously
mangled
the
insolent
tyrant
of
the
ship
the
monkey
had
feared
none
but
mack
our
red
blue
and
yellow
macaw
a
monstrous
and
resplendent
fowl
in
whose
iron
bill
even
brazil
nuts
were
soft
but
we
all
respected
mack
he
was
the
wisest
thing
on
the
ship
if
an
idle
man
felt
and
approached
mack
to
demonstrate
his
humour
that
great
bird
gave
an
inquiring
turn
to
its
head
and
its
deliberate
and
unwinking
eyes
hid
the
rapid
play
of
its
prescient
mind
the
man
stopped
and
would
speak
but
playfully
nobody
ever
dared
when
mack
first
boarded
the
ship
a
group
of
us
gloved
smothered
him
with
a
heavy
blanket
and
fastened
a
chain
to
his
leg
he
knew
he
was
overpowered
and
did
not
struggle
but
inside
the
blanket
we
heard
some
horrible
chuckles
we
took
off
the
blanket
and
stood
back
expectantly
from
that
dishevelled
and
puzzling
giant
of
a
parrot
he
shook
his
feathers
flat
again
quite
looked
at
us
sardonically
and
murmured
very
distinctly
then
glanced
at
his
foot
there
was
a
little
surprise
in
his
eye
when
he
saw
the
chain
there
he
lifted
up
the
chain
to
examine
it
tried
it
and
then
quietly
and
easily
bit
it
through
he
said
again
straightening
his
vest
still
regarding
us
solemnly
then
he
moved
off
to
a
davit
and
climbed
the
mizzen
shrouds
to
the
when
he
saw
us
at
food
he
came
down
with
nonchalance
and
overlooked
our
table
from
the
cross
beam
of
an
awning
apparently
satisfied
he
came
directly
to
the
mess
table
sitting
beside
me
and
took
his
share
with
all
the
assurance
of
a
member
allowing
me
to
idle
with
his
beautiful
wings
and
his
tail
he
was
a
beauty
he
took
my
finger
in
his
awful
bill
and
rolled
it
round
like
a
cigarette
i
wondered
what
he
would
do
to
it
before
he
let
it
go
but
he
merely
let
it
go
he
was
a
great
character
magnanimously
minded
i
never
knew
a
tamer
creature
than
mack
that
evening
he
rejoined
a
flock
of
his
wild
brothers
in
the
distant
but
he
was
back
next
morning
and
put
everlasting
fear
into
the
terrier
who
was
at
breakfast
by
suddenly
appearing
before
him
with
wings
outspread
on
the
deck
looking
like
a
disrupted
and
angry
rainbow
and
making
raucous
threats
the
dog
gave
one
yell
and
fell
over
backwards
we
had
added
a
to
our
pets
and
he
must
have
weighed
at
least
three
pounds
he
had
neither
vice
nor
virtue
but
was
merely
a
squab
in
a
shady
corner
whenever
the
dog
approached
him
he
would
rise
on
his
legs
however
and
inflate
himself
till
he
was
globular
this
was
incomprehensible
to
tinker
who
was
contemptuous
but
being
a
little
uncertain
would
make
a
circuit
of
the
frog
sitting
one
day
in
the
shadow
of
the
box
which
enclosed
the
rudder
chain
was
the
frog
and
we
were
near
and
up
came
tinker
all
unthinking
his
nose
to
the
deck
the
frog
hurriedly
furnished
his
pneumatic
act
when
tinker
who
did
not
know
froggie
was
there
was
close
beside
him
and
tinker
snapped
sideways
in
a
panic
poor
punctured
froggie
dwindled
instantly
and
died
i
could
add
to
the
list
of
our
creatures
the
anaconda
which
was
found
coming
aboard
by
the
gangway
but
that
a
stoker
saw
him
first
became
hysterical
and
slew
the
reptile
with
a
shovel
there
were
the
coral
snakes
which
came
inboard
over
the
cables
and
through
the
hawse
pipes
and
the
vampire
bats
which
frequented
the
forecastle
but
they
are
insignificant
beside
our
peccary
i
forgot
to
tell
you
the
skipper
never
made
a
tame
creature
of
her
she
refused
us
we
brought
her
up
from
the
bunkers
where
first
she
was
placed
because
the
stokers
flatly
refused
her
society
in
the
dark
she
was
brought
up
on
deck
in
bonds
snapping
her
tushes
in
a
direful
way
and
when
released
did
most
indomitably
charge
all
our
ship
s
company
bristles
up
and
her
automatic
teeth
louder
and
more
rapid
than
ever
how
we
fled
when
i
turned
on
my
vantage
the
manner
of
my
getting
there
all
unknown
to
see
who
was
my
neighbour
it
was
my
abashed
and
elderly
captain
who
can
look
upon
sea
weather
at
its
worst
with
an
easy
eye
but
who
then
was
striving
desperately
to
get
his
legs
which
were
in
pyjamas
ten
feet
above
the
deck
in
case
the
very
wild
pig
below
had
wings
after
the
peccary
was
released
we
could
not
call
the
ship
ours
we
crept
about
as
thieves
it
was
fortunate
that
she
always
gave
warning
of
her
proximity
by
making
the
noise
of
castanets
with
her
tusks
so
that
we
had
time
to
get
elevated
before
she
arrived
but
i
never
really
knew
how
fast
she
could
move
till
i
saw
her
chase
the
dog
whom
she
despised
and
ignored
one
morning
his
valiant
barking
at
her
from
a
distance
he
judged
to
be
adequate
annoyed
her
and
she
shot
at
him
like
a
projectile
her
slender
limbs
and
diminutive
hooves
were
those
of
a
deer
and
they
became
merely
a
haze
beneath
her
body
which
was
a
flying
passion
the
terrified
dog
had
no
chance
but
just
as
she
closed
with
him
her
feet
slipped
and
so
tinker
s
life
was
saved
her
end
was
pitiful
one
day
she
got
into
the
saloon
the
doctor
and
i
were
there
and
saw
her
trot
in
at
one
door
and
we
trotted
out
at
another
door
now
the
saloon
was
the
pride
of
the
skipper
and
when
the
old
man
tried
to
bribe
her
out
of
talked
to
her
from
the
open
skylight
she
insulted
him
with
her
mouth
he
sent
for
his
men
from
behind
a
shut
door
of
the
saloon
alley
way
we
heard
a
fusilade
of
tusks
in
the
saloon
shrieks
from
the
maddened
dog
uproar
from
the
parrots
and
the
hoarse
shouts
of
the
crew
the
pig
was
charging
ten
ways
at
once
stealing
a
look
from
the
cabin
we
saw
the
boatswain
appear
with
a
bunch
of
cotton
waste
soaked
in
kerosene
blazing
at
the
end
of
a
bamboo
and
the
mate
with
a
knife
lashed
to
another
pole
the
peccary
charged
the
lot
there
broke
out
the
cries
of
tophet
and
through
chaos
champed
insistently
the
high
note
of
the
tusks
she
was
noosed
and
caged
but
nothing
could
be
done
with
the
little
fury
and
when
i
peeped
in
at
her
a
few
days
later
she
was
full
length
and
dying
she
opened
one
glazing
eye
at
me
and
snapped
her
teeth
slowly
game
to
the
end
was
reported
at
breakfast
that
we
sail
the
bread
was
sour
the
butter
was
oil
the
sugar
was
black
with
flies
the
sausages
were
tinned
and
very
white
and
dead
and
the
bacon
was
all
fat
and
even
the
awning
could
not
keep
the
sun
away
got
the
hatches
on
number
four
hold
it
is
reported
we
sail
ship
was
crowded
this
night
with
the
boys
for
a
last
jollification
we
fired
rockets
and
swore
enduring
friendships
with
anybody
and
many
sang
different
songs
together
it
is
reported
that
we
sail
is
reported
that
we
sail
capella
has
come
to
life
the
master
is
on
the
bridge
the
first
mate
is
on
the
forecastle
head
the
second
mate
is
on
the
poop
and
the
engineers
are
below
there
are
stern
and
minatory
cries
and
men
who
run
at
the
first
slow
clanking
of
the
cable
we
raised
wild
cheers
the
ship
s
body
began
to
tremble
and
there
was
thunder
under
her
counter
we
actually
came
away
from
the
jetty
where
long
we
had
seemed
a
fixture
we
got
into
slowly
turned
tail
on
porto
velho
there
was
old
man
jim
diminished
on
the
distant
jetty
waving
his
hat
porto
velho
looked
strange
again
away
we
went
we
reached
the
bend
of
the
river
and
turned
the
corner
there
was
the
last
we
shall
ever
see
of
porto
velho
gone
the
forest
unfolding
in
reverse
order
seemed
brighter
and
all
would
have
been
quite
well
but
the
fourth
engineer
came
up
from
his
duty
and
fell
insensible
he
was
very
yellow
and
the
doctor
had
work
to
do
here
was
the
first
of
our
company
to
succumb
to
the
country
there
were
but
six
more
days
of
forest
for
the
old
capella
empty
and
light
as
a
balloon
the
collisions
with
the
floating
timber
causing
muffled
thunder
in
her
hollow
body
came
down
the
swift
floods
of
the
madeira
and
the
amazon
rivers
like
a
cunarder
at
sixteen
knots
as
the
skipper
said
and
there
on
the
sixth
day
was
para
again
and
the
sea
near
our
spirits
mounted
released
from
the
dead
weight
of
heat
and
silence
but
i
was
to
lose
the
doctor
at
para
for
he
was
then
to
return
to
porto
velho
having
discharged
his
duty
to
the
capella
s
company
the
skipper
took
his
wallet
and
we
went
ashore
with
him
he
to
his
task
of
clearing
his
vessel
and
we
for
a
final
sad
excursion
much
later
in
the
day
suspecting
an
unnameable
evil
was
gathering
to
my
undoing
i
called
at
the
agent
s
office
and
found
the
skipper
had
returned
to
the
ship
that
she
was
sailing
that
night
and
the
regulations
of
para
being
what
they
were
it
being
after
six
in
the
evening
i
could
not
leave
the
city
till
next
morning
my
haggard
and
dismayed
array
of
thoughts
broke
in
confusion
and
left
me
gibbering
with
not
one
idea
for
use
without
saying
even
to
my
old
comrade
i
took
to
my
heels
and
left
him
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
the
doctor
aha
my
staunch
support
in
the
long
hot
and
empty
time
at
the
back
of
things
where
were
but
trees
bad
food
and
a
jest
to
brace
our
souls
if
ever
you
should
see
know
dear
lad
i
carried
the
damnable
regulations
and
a
whole
row
of
officials
the
union
jack
at
the
main
firing
every
gun
as
i
bore
down
on
them
i
broke
through
only
death
could
have
barred
me
from
my
ship
and
the
way
home
next
morning
we
were
at
sea
we
dropped
the
pilot
early
and
changed
our
course
to
the
north
bound
for
barbados
though
on
the
line
the
difference
in
the
air
at
sea
after
our
long
enclosure
in
the
rivers
of
the
forest
was
keenly
felt
and
the
ship
too
had
been
so
level
and
quiet
but
here
she
was
lively
again
full
of
movements
and
noises
the
bows
were
at
their
old
difference
with
the
skyline
and
the
steady
wind
of
the
outer
was
driving
over
us
before
noon
when
i
went
in
to
the
chief
my
crony
was
flat
and
moribund
with
a
temperature
at
and
he
had
no
interest
in
this
life
whatever
i
had
added
the
apothecary
s
duties
to
those
of
the
purser
and
here
found
my
first
job
doctor
i
gave
him
lots
of
grains
of
quinine
and
lots
more
afterwards
and
plenty
of
calomel
when
he
was
at
again
was
that
all
right
the
sight
of
the
big
and
hearty
chief
when
he
was
about
once
more
yellow
insecure
and
somewhat
shrunken
made
us
dubious
yet
now
were
we
rolling
home
she
was
breasting
down
into
a
creaming
smother
the
seas
were
blue
and
the
world
was
fresh
and
wide
all
the
way
back
there
was
one
fine
night
as
we
were
climbing
slowly
up
the
slope
of
the
globe
when
we
lifted
the
whole
constellation
of
the
great
bear
the
last
star
of
the
tail
just
dipping
below
the
seas
straight
over
the
capella
s
bows
as
she
pitched
then
were
we
assured
affairs
were
rightly
ordered
and
slept
well
and
contented
late
one
afternoon
we
sighted
barbados
the
sea
was
dark
and
the
light
was
golden
the
island
did
not
look
like
land
it
was
a
faint
but
constant
cloud
the
empty
sky
came
down
to
the
dark
sea
in
bright
walls
which
had
but
a
bloom
of
azure
overhead
it
was
day
but
the
sea
was
fluid
night
above
the
island
was
a
group
of
cirrus
turned
to
the
setting
sun
like
an
audience
of
intent
faces
near
to
starboard
was
a
white
ship
fully
rigged
standing
towards
the
island
with
royals
set
and
even
a
towering
main
skysail
tall
as
she
was
she
looked
but
a
multiple
cloud
which
had
dropped
from
the
sky
and
had
settled
on
the
dark
sea
and
over
it
was
drifting
in
a
faint
air
buoyant
but
unable
to
lift
we
overhauled
that
stately
ship
she
was
reflecting
the
dayfall
from
the
white
rounds
of
her
many
sails
she
was
regal
she
was
paramount
in
her
world
and
the
sun
seemed
to
be
watching
her
and
shining
solely
for
her
illustrious
progress
the
clarity
and
the
peace
of
it
was
in
us
as
we
leaned
against
the
rail
watching
barbados
grow
and
watching
that
exalted
ship
this
is
all
right
said
the
chief
we
were
coming
to
the
things
we
knew
and
understood
in
the
island
near
us
were
men
quays
and
shops
this
evening
had
a
familiar
and
friendly
look
barbados
at
last
there
would
be
something
to
eat
too
and
we
kept
talking
of
that
do
you
know
what
good
bread
and
butter
tastes
like
or
mealy
baked
potatoes
or
fruit
from
which
the
juice
runs
when
you
bite
or
crisp
salads
not
you
not
if
you
haven
t
lived
for
long
on
tinned
stuffs
bread
which
smelt
like
vinegar
and
butter
to
which
a
spoon
had
to
be
used
to
the
door
of
the
saloon
alley
way
we
saw
the
steward
come
and
begin
to
swing
his
bell
tea
ho
said
the
mate
keep
it
said
the
chief
i
know
it
sardines
and
hash
not
for
me
we
shall
get
some
grub
in
the
morning
oranges
and
bananas
boys
i
m
tired
of
oil
my
belt
is
in
by
three
when
the
sun
once
touched
the
sea
it
sank
visibly
like
a
weight
night
came
at
once
we
passed
a
winking
light
and
soon
ahead
of
us
in
the
dark
was
grouped
a
multitude
of
lower
stars
that
was
bridgetown
those
stars
opened
and
spread
round
us
showing
nothing
of
the
wall
of
night
in
which
they
were
fixed
well
there
it
was
we
could
smell
the
good
land
we
should
see
it
in
the
morning
we
had
really
got
there
the
engines
stopped
there
was
a
shout
from
the
steamer
s
bridge
and
a
thunderous
rumbling
as
the
cable
ran
out
and
then
a
remarkable
quiet
the
old
man
came
sideways
down
the
bridge
ladder
with
a
hurricane
lamp
and
stood
with
us
striking
a
light
for
his
cigar
here
we
are
chief
he
said
what
about
coals
in
the
morning
the
night
was
hot
there
was
no
wind
and
as
we
sat
yarning
on
the
bunker
hatch
another
cluster
of
stars
moved
in
swiftly
together
came
to
a
stand
near
us
and
a
peremptory
gun
was
fired
that
was
the
british
mail
steamer
we
looked
at
her
with
awe
we
could
see
the
toffs
in
evening
dress
idling
in
the
glow
of
her
electric
lights
what
a
feed
they
had
just
finished
but
the
greatest
wonder
of
her
deck
was
the
women
in
white
gowns
we
could
hear
the
strange
laughter
of
the
women
and
listened
for
it
that
was
music
worth
listening
to
our
little
mob
of
toughs
in
turns
used
the
night
glasses
on
those
women
and
in
a
dead
silence
there
were
some
kiddies
too
we
were
looking
at
the
benign
lights
of
the
island
and
trying
to
make
out
what
they
meant
the
sense
of
our
repose
and
the
touch
of
those
warm
and
velvet
airs
and
the
scent
of
land
were
like
the
kindness
and
security
of
home
i
know
this
place
drawled
sandy
i
was
here
once
before
i
went
into
steam
i
used
to
come
out
to
the
islands
when
i
was
a
young
un
i
made
two
voyages
in
the
chocolate
she
was
my
first
ship
she
was
a
daisy
too
once
we
lifted
vincent
days
out
of
liverpool
that
was
going
if
you
like
if
old
was
the
old
man
of
the
chocolate
girl
he
could
only
get
a
trip
in
a
ship
like
this
like
an
iron
street
with
a
factory
stack
in
the
middle
but
he
can
t
he
s
dead
he
had
the
mignonette
and
she
went
missing
among
the
bahamas
there
s
millions
of
islands
in
the
bahamas
they
re
north
of
this
place
you
couldn
t
visit
all
those
islands
in
a
lifetime
if
you
ask
me
some
of
the
islands
in
these
seas
are
very
funny
there
s
something
wrong
about
a
few
of
them
they
re
not
down
in
the
chart
so
i
ve
heard
one
day
you
lift
one
and
you
never
knew
it
was
there
what
s
that
says
the
old
man
can
t
make
that
place
then
he
reckons
he
s
found
new
land
and
takes
his
position
he
calls
it
after
his
wife
and
cables
home
what
he
s
done
the
next
thing
is
a
gunboat
goes
there
and
beats
about
and
lays
over
the
spot
but
she
doesn
t
find
no
island
the
gunboat
cables
home
that
the
merchant
chap
was
drunk
or
something
and
that
he
steamed
over
the
spot
and
got
hundreds
of
fathoms
they
re
always
so
clever
in
the
navy
but
i
ve
heard
some
of
these
islands
are
not
right
you
see
one
once
and
nobody
ever
sees
it
again
i
knew
a
man
and
he
was
marooned
on
one
of
those
islands
he
sailed
with
me
afterwards
on
one
of
the
blue
anchor
steamers
to
sydney
one
time
he
was
on
a
craft
out
of
martinique
for
cuba
she
was
a
schooner
of
the
islands
and
fine
vessels
they
are
you
ll
see
a
lot
about
us
in
the
morning
this
man
s
name
was
moffat
his
schooner
had
a
mulatto
for
a
master
and
that
nigger
was
a
fool
and
very
superstitious
by
all
accounts
they
ran
short
of
water
and
it
s
pretty
bad
if
you
fall
short
of
water
in
these
seas
off
the
regular
routes
there
s
nothing
you
might
drift
for
weeks
and
see
nothing
off
the
track
then
they
sighted
an
island
the
mulatto
chap
pretended
he
knew
all
about
that
island
he
said
he
had
been
there
before
but
he
was
a
liar
it
was
only
a
little
island
like
some
trees
afloat
they
came
down
on
it
and
anchored
in
ten
fathoms
and
waited
for
daylight
next
morning
some
wind
freshened
off
shore
and
moffat
takes
a
nigger
and
rows
to
the
beach
there
was
only
a
light
swell
breaking
on
the
coral
and
landing
was
easy
moffat
told
the
nigger
to
stay
by
the
boat
while
he
took
a
look
round
there
was
a
bit
of
a
coral
beach
with
a
pile
of
high
rocks
at
the
ends
of
it
like
pillars
each
side
of
a
doorstep
what
was
inside
the
island
moffat
couldn
t
see
because
at
the
back
of
the
beach
was
a
wood
he
said
he
heard
a
sound
like
a
bird
calling
but
he
reckoned
there
wasn
t
a
soul
in
that
place
the
schooner
was
riding
just
off
he
turned
and
was
crunching
his
way
up
the
coral
with
the
idea
of
looking
for
a
way
inside
he
got
to
the
trees
and
then
heard
the
nigger
shout
in
a
fright
the
black
beggar
was
pushing
out
the
boat
he
got
in
it
too
and
began
rowing
back
to
the
schooner
as
if
somebody
was
coming
after
him
moffat
yelled
and
ran
down
to
the
surf
but
the
nigger
kept
right
on
there
was
moffat
up
to
his
knees
in
the
water
and
in
a
fine
state
the
boat
reached
the
now
thinks
moffat
there
ll
be
trouble
do
you
know
what
happened
though
for
a
little
while
nothing
happened
then
they
began
to
haul
in
her
cable
she
upanchored
and
stood
out
that
s
a
fact
bill
told
me
he
felt
pretty
sick
when
he
saw
it
he
didn
t
like
the
look
of
it
he
watched
the
schooner
turn
tail
and
soon
she
found
more
wind
and
got
out
of
sight
past
the
island
he
watched
her
dance
past
one
of
the
piles
of
rocks
till
there
was
nothing
but
empty
sea
behind
the
rock
then
his
eye
caught
something
moving
on
the
rock
something
moved
round
it
out
of
his
sight
he
never
saw
what
it
was
he
wished
he
had
well
he
had
a
pretty
bad
time
he
couldn
t
find
anyone
on
the
island
in
a
manner
of
speaking
but
somebody
was
always
going
round
a
corner
or
behind
a
tree
he
caught
them
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
said
it
was
enough
to
get
on
a
man
s
nerves
the
way
that
thing
always
just
wasn
t
there
whatever
it
was
curse
the
goats
bill
used
to
say
to
himself
one
day
bill
was
strolling
round
figuring
out
what
he
could
do
to
that
mulatto
when
he
met
him
again
and
then
he
found
a
sea
cave
he
went
in
it
was
a
silly
thing
to
do
because
the
way
in
was
so
low
that
he
had
to
crawl
but
the
cave
was
big
enough
inside
for
a
the
walls
ran
up
into
a
vault
and
the
water
came
up
to
the
bottom
of
the
walls
nearly
all
round
the
water
was
like
a
green
light
a
bright
light
came
up
through
the
water
and
the
reflections
were
wriggling
all
over
the
rocks
making
them
seem
to
shake
the
water
was
like
thick
glass
full
of
light
he
could
see
a
long
way
down
but
not
to
the
bottom
while
he
was
looking
at
it
the
water
heaved
up
quietly
full
three
feet
and
the
reflections
on
the
walls
faded
then
he
saw
the
hole
through
which
he
had
crawled
was
gone
now
bill
moffat
you
re
in
a
regular
mess
he
says
to
himself
he
dived
for
the
hole
but
he
never
found
that
way
out
and
the
funny
thing
was
he
couldn
t
come
to
the
top
again
bill
saw
it
was
a
proper
case
that
time
and
no
more
sundays
in
poplar
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
deeper
he
went
the
thinner
the
water
was
it
was
thin
and
clear
like
electric
light
he
could
see
miles
there
and
down
he
kept
falling
till
he
hit
the
bottom
with
a
bang
it
scared
a
lot
of
fishes
and
they
flew
up
like
birds
he
looked
up
to
see
them
go
and
there
was
the
sun
overhead
only
it
was
like
a
bright
round
of
green
jelly
all
shaking
bill
found
it
was
dead
easy
to
breathe
in
water
that
was
no
thicker
than
air
so
he
got
up
brushed
the
sand
off
and
looked
round
a
flock
of
fishes
flew
about
him
quite
friendly
and
as
beautiful
as
amazon
parrots
a
big
crab
walked
ahead
and
bill
thought
he
had
better
follow
the
crab
he
came
to
a
path
which
was
marked
with
shells
and
at
the
end
of
the
path
he
saw
the
fore
half
of
a
ship
while
he
was
looking
at
it
somebody
pushed
the
curtains
from
the
hatchway
and
came
out
and
looked
at
him
good
lord
it
s
davy
jones
said
bill
to
himself
hullo
bill
said
davy
come
in
glad
to
see
you

what
a
time
you
ve
moffat
said
that
davy
wasn
t
a
decent
sight
having
barnacles
all
over
his
face
but
he
shook
hands
you
re
hand

quite
cold
bill
said
davy
did
you
lose
your
soul
coming
along

nearly
did
that
before
bill
moffat
you
nearly
did
it
that
christmas
night

last

bill
went
inside
with
davy
there
was
sea
junk
all
over
the
place
i
find
these
things
very
handy
old
chap
said
davy
to
bill
seeing
he
was
looking
at
them
it
s
good
of
you
to
send
them
down
though
i
don
t
like
the
iron
for
it
won
t
stand
the
climate
see
that
old
hat
it
s
a
spanish
admiral
s
i
clap
it
on
backwards
whenever
i
want
to
go
so
they
sat
down
and
yarned
about
old
times
though
bill
told
me
that
davy
seemed
to
remember
people
after
everybody
else
had
forgotten
them
which
was
confusing
oh
yes
davy
would
say
old
johnson
yes
he
used
to
talk
of
me
in
a
rare
way
he
was
a
dog
was
johnson
i
ve
heard
him
many
a
time
but
he
s
changed
since
his
ship
came
downstairs
he
s
a
better
man
he
s
not
so
funny
as
he
then
they
had
a
pipe
and
after
a
bit
things
began
to
drag
come
into
the
garden
bill
said
davy
come
and
have
a
look
all
round
the
garden
bill
noticed
the
of
ships
nailed
up
some
of
the
names
bill
knew
and
some
he
didn
t
being
spanish
what
do
you
think
of
my
collection
said
davy
ever
seen
as
fine
a
one
i
lay
you
never
have
then
they
came
to
a
door
come
in
said
davy
this
is
my
locker
ever
heard
of
my
locker
bill
said
it
was
pretty
dark
inside
just
light
enough
to
see
but
there
was
only
miles
and
miles
of
all
set
out
in
rows
with
a
label
on
each
what
do
you
think
of
that
lot
bill
asked
davy
i
shall
have
to
get
larger
premises
bill
choked
a
bit
for
the
place
smelt
stale
and
seaweedy
what
s
in
the
davy
said
bill
souls
said
davy
but
there
s
a
lot
of
trash
though
now
and
then
i
get
a
good
one
here
now
see
this
this
is
a
fine
one
though
i
mustn
t
tell
you
where
i
got
it
and
people
said
he
hadn
t
got
one
but
i
knew
better
and
there
it
but
bill
couldn
t
see
anything
in
the
pots
he
could
only
hear
a
rustling
as
if
something
was
rubbing
on
the
wicker
or
a
twittering
at
last
davy
came
to
a
new
pot
do
you
know
who
s
in
this
one
bill
he
said
but
bill
couldn
t
guess
well
bill
it
s
your
soul
and
a
poorer
one
i
never
see
it
was
hardly
worth
setting
the
pot
for
a
soul
like
then
davy
began
to
shake
the
pot
and
soon
got
wild
here
where
the
deuce
has
that
soul
gone
he
said
and
put
his
ear
to
the
bars
then
he
put
the
pot
down
and
made
a
rush
at
bill
to
get
it
back
but
bill
jumped
backwards
got
through
the
door
ran
through
the
house
grabbed
the
admiral
s
cocked
hat
and
clapped
it
on
backwards
then
he
shot
out
of
the
water
at
once
and
found
himself
on
the
rocks
outside
the
cave
with
the
cocked
hat
still
on
his
head
he
s
kept
that
hat
ever
since
and
money
wouldn
t
buy
when
i
woke
next
morning
it
was
like
waking
to
a
great
occasion
the
tropic
sun
was
blazing
outside
the
day
seemed
of
a
superior
quality
an
old
negress
shuffled
by
my
cabin
door
through
which
was
a
peep
of
the
town
across
the
harbour
and
she
had
some
necklaces
of
shells
strung
on
one
skinny
black
arm
and
carried
a
basket
of
oranges
on
the
other
i
jumped
up
and
bought
all
the
oranges
a
boat
came
to
our
gangway
and
some
of
us
went
ashore
i
don
t
know
what
a
man
feels
like
who
is
released
one
fine
day
from
imprisonment
into
the
stream
of
his
fellows
but
i
should
think
he
is
first
a
little
stunned
and
afterwards
becomes
like
a
child
s
balloon
in
a
breeze
the
people
we
had
met
in
the
brazils
never
laughed
and
i
myself
had
always
felt
that
there
we
had
been
watched
and
followed
unseen
that
something
was
there
watching
us
waiting
its
time
knowing
well
it
could
get
us
before
we
escaped
we
were
at
last
outside
it
and
free
the
anchorage
of
bridgetown
seemed
anarchic
after
our
level
sombre
experience
for
the
sea
was
a
green
light
flashing
and
volatile
with
white
schooners
driving
upon
it
negroes
shouting
and
laughing
over
the
bulwarks
or
frantically
hauling
on
the
sheets
the
rushing
water
was
crowded
with
leaping
boats
all
gaudily
painted
and
even
the
sunshine
moving
rapidly
on
quivering
white
sails
and
the
white
hulls
buoyantly
swinging
was
a
kind
of
shaking
laughter
our
negro
boatmen
sang
as
they
rowed
when
they
were
not
swearing
at
other
boatmen
the
world
had
got
wine
in
its
head
we
went
to
the
ice
house
and
bought
english
beer
oh
the
taste
of
beer
in
the
brisk
and
sunny
streets
there
were
english
women
cool
dainty
a
little
haughty
their
dresses
smelling
of
new
linen
and
they
were
looking
in
at
shop
windows
we
had
got
our
feet
down
on
home
pavements
and
the
streets
had
the
newness
and
sparkle
of
holiday
hi
cabby
he
drove
us
along
coral
roads
under
cocoanut
palms
and
there
were
golden
hills
hills
once
more
one
way
and
on
the
other
hand
was
a
beach
glowing
like
white
fire
with
a
sea
beyond
of
a
blue
that
was
ultimate
profound
and
as
tense
and
as
still
as
rapture
we
came
to
a
hotel
where
there
was
stiff
napery
with
creases
in
it
on
a
breakfast
table
there
was
a
silver
there
was
and
crusty
bread
butter
in
ice
and
new
milk
there
was
a
heaped
plate
of
fruit
there
was
a
crystal
jug
filled
with
cold
water
and
sunshine
and
it
threw
a
wavering
light
on
the
damask
we
had
some
of
everything
we
ate
for
more
than
an
hour
steadily
a
man
could
not
have
done
it
alone
and
without
shame
there
was
one
superior
lady
tourist
with
grey
curls
on
her
cheeks
and
a
face
like
doom
and
she
sent
for
the
manager
and
asked
if
we
were
to
breakfast
there
again
she
wanted
to
know
the
chief
begged
me
as
the
youngest
of
the
party
to
go
over
and
kiss
her
but
i
pointed
out
that
seeing
where
we
had
come
from
and
what
we
had
suffered
it
was
the
plain
duty
of
any
really
dear
old
soul
to
come
over
and
kiss
us
on
a
morning
like
that
in
the
afternoon
we
were
aboard
again
waiting
for
the
skipper
to
return
with
the
new
orders
to
what
part
of
the
world
would
the
power
in
leadenhall
street
now
consign
us
sandy
thought
new
orleans
but
we
could
rule
that
out
for
there
was
no
cotton
just
then
pensacola
was
more
likely
the
chief
said
with
a
deck
cargo
of
lumber
for
hamburg
that
guess
made
the
crowd
glum
winter
in
the
atlantic
she
rolling
her
heart
out
and
the
timber
that
was
level
with
the
casing
groaning
and
straining
at
every
dwell
on
that
prospect
was
to
feel
a
cold
draught
out
of
the
valley
of
shadows
two
nigger
boys
were
overside
diving
for
coins
you
threw
a
s
nickel
muck
a
handful
worth
it
went
below
oscillating
as
though
sentiently
dodging
the
contorted
and
convulsive
figure
of
the
boy
diving
after
it
the
transparency
of
the
fathoms
was
that
of
a
denser
air
when
the
sea
was
still
at
the
slack
of
the
tides
this
tropic
anchorage
was
not
like
water
you
did
not
look
upon
it
but
into
it
being
hardly
aware
of
its
surface
it
was
surprising
to
see
our
massive
iron
plates
stand
upright
in
it
we
were
still
an
ugly
black
bulk
as
we
were
on
the
ditch
water
of
swansea
but
our
sea
wagon
had
lost
its
look
of
squat
heaviness
even
our
iron
ship
was
transmuted
such
was
the
lift
and
radiance
of
barbados
and
its
sea
into
the
buoyancy
of
the
unsubstantial
stuff
of
that
scene
about
us
the
low
hills
of
greenish
gold
so
delicate
under
the
sky
of
malachite
blue
that
you
doubted
whether
mortals
could
walk
there
bridgetown
was
between
those
hills
and
the
sea
a
cluster
of
white
cubes
with
inconsequential
touches
of
scarlet
orange
and
emerald
beneath
our
keel
was
a
boy
who
might
have
been
flying
there
on
one
side
of
the
town
was
a
belt
of
coral
beach
it
was
and
the
palms
above
the
beach
with
their
secretive
villas
and
the
hills
beyond
floated
on
that
white
glow
the
sea
below
the
beach
was
an
incandescent
green
it
might
have
been
burning
through
contact
with
the
island
then
the
sea
spread
down
to
us
in
areas
of
opaque
violet
and
blue
till
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ship
it
became
transparent
and
was
but
a
denser
atmosphere
you
in
the
hard
and
bitter
north
on
the
exposed
summit
of
the
world
where
polaris
glitters
in
the
forehead
of
a
frozen
god
hardly
know
what
young
and
luscious
stuff
this
earth
is
where
the
constant
sun
and
tepid
rains
and
salt
air
have
preserved
its
bloom
and
flush
of
abounding
life
there
came
the
skipper
s
boat
he
in
his
white
ducks
and
panama
hat
in
the
stern
sheets
his
wallet
in
his
hand
he
knew
that
we
all
looked
at
him
with
assumed
indifference
when
he
stepped
among
us
on
deck
that
was
his
time
to
show
he
was
the
ship
s
master
he
feigned
that
we
were
not
there
he
turned
to
the
chief
mate
all
ready
brown
all
ready
then
the
master
walked
slowly
knowing
our
eyes
were
on
his
back
to
his
place
aft
first
going
in
to
speak
to
the
chief
the
chief
came
out
some
minutes
after
tampa
boys
said
he
florida
for
phosphate
then
that
evening
we
were
on
our
way
and
turned
inwards
through
the
line
of
the
caribbees
passing
between
the
islands
of
lucia
and
vincent
high
purple
masses
of
rock
lucia
s
mass
ascending
into
cones
the
skipper
had
been
to
most
of
the
west
indian
islands
and
remembered
them
while
i
listened
we
stood
at
the
door
watching
the
islands
across
the
evening
seas
the
sun
just
above
the
sharply
dark
rim
of
ocean
touched
the
sea
and
sank
a
thin
paring
of
silver
moon
had
the
sky
to
itself
i
went
into
the
and
the
old
man
who
grim
and
sour
as
you
might
think
him
mellows
into
confidential
friendliness
when
he
has
you
to
himself
spread
his
charts
of
the
spanish
main
under
the
yellow
lamp
which
was
a
slow
pendulum
as
she
rolled
and
he
put
his
spectacles
on
his
lean
brown
face
talked
of
unfrequented
cays
and
of
the
negro
islands
and
debated
which
route
we
should
take
the
fourth
morning
at
was
a
burning
day
with
a
sky
almost
cloudless
and
a
slow
sea
which
had
the
surface
of
its
rich
blue
deeps
shot
with
turquoise
lights
while
fields
of
saffron
gulfweed
stained
it
and
we
had
close
over
our
port
bow
the
most
beautiful
island
in
the
world
it
is
useless
to
deny
it
and
to
declare
you
know
a
better
island
can
t
i
see
jamaica
now
i
see
it
most
plain
it
descends
abruptly
from
the
meridian
pinnacles
and
escarpments
trembling
in
the
upper
air
with
distance
and
delicate
poise
and
comes
down
in
rolling
forests
and
steep
verdant
slopes
where
facets
of
bare
rock
glitter
to
more
leisurely
open
glades
and
knolls
and
then
being
not
far
from
the
sea
drops
in
sheer
cliffs
to
where
the
white
combers
pulse
it
is
a
jewel
which
smells
like
a
flower
the
capella
went
close
in
till
port
antonio
under
the
blue
mountains
was
plain
and
though
i
could
see
the
few
scattered
houses
i
could
not
see
the
narrow
ledges
where
men
could
stand
in
such
a
steep
land
we
crawled
over
the
blue
floor
in
which
that
sea
mountain
is
set
and
cruised
along
feeling
very
small
under
the
various
and
towering
shape
for
long
i
watched
it
declaring
continually
that
some
day
i
must
return
and
that
is
the
greatest
compliment
a
traveller
on
his
way
home
can
pay
to
any
spot
on
earth
it
faded
as
we
drew
northwards
over
seas
to
the
north
was
a
long
low
stratum
of
permanent
cloud
and
beneath
it
was
the
faint
presentiment
of
cuba
still
we
were
in
the
spell
of
the
very
halcyon
weather
of
old
tales
with
the
world
our
own
though
once
this
day
there
was
a
great
rain
burst
and
the
capella
was
lost
in
falling
water
her
syren
blaring
we
neared
the
cuban
coast
by
the
isle
of
pines
a
pallid
desert
shore
apparently
treeless
and
parched
the
next
morning
we
came
to
the
western
cape
of
the
island
rounding
it
in
company
with
a
white
island
schooner
its
crew
of
toughs
watching
us
from
her
shadeless
deck
and
changed
our
course
almost
due
north
now
we
were
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
soon
upset
its
notoriously
uncertain
temper
for
a
norther
met
us
and
piped
till
it
was
a
full
gale
and
it
kicked
up
a
nasty
sea
which
flung
about
the
empty
capella
like
a
there
was
a
night
of
it
towards
morning
it
eased
up
and
i
woke
to
a
serene
sunrise
and
found
we
were
in
the
pale
green
water
of
coral
soundings
with
the
floridan
pilot
even
then
standing
in
to
us
his
tug
bearing
centrally
on
its
bridge
a
gilded
eagle
with
rampant
wings
in
a
little
while
we
were
fast
to
the
quarantine
quay
at
mullet
island
detained
as
a
yellow
fever
suspect
the
medical
officers
boarded
us
ranged
amidships
the
capella
s
crowd
from
the
master
down
and
put
in
the
mouth
of
each
of
us
a
thermometer
and
so
for
a
time
we
stood
ridiculously
smoking
glass
cigarettes
one
stoker
was
put
aside
for
he
had
a
temperature
then
into
the
cabins
and
the
saloon
the
forecastle
and
into
the
holds
were
put
gallipots
of
burning
sulphur
and
the
doors
were
closed
we
became
a
great
and
dreadful
stench
and
i
went
ashore
there
was
a
deserted
beach
of
comminuted
shells
its
glare
as
bright
as
snow
in
sunshine
it
was
littered
with
the
relics
of
old
wrecks
with
sea
rubbish
and
the
carapaces
of
crabs
beyond
the
beach
was
a
calcareous
desert
with
a
scrub
of
palmetto
and
evergreen
and
patches
of
flowering
coreopsis
and
blue
squills
hidden
by
the
scrub
were
shallow
lagoons
it
is
hard
to
tell
the
sea
from
the
land
in
warm
and
aqueous
florida
for
sea
and
land
so
invade
each
other
s
dominions
water
and
land
were
asleep
in
the
sun
i
was
alone
in
the
island
and
sat
in
a
decaying
boat
by
the
shore
of
a
lagoon
where
nothing
moved
but
the
little
crabs
playing
hide
and
seek
in
the
moist
crevices
of
the
boat
and
the
pelicans
which
sat
round
the
interminable
flat
shores
sometimes
the
pelicans
woke
and
yawned
and
fanned
the
heat
with
great
slow
wings
in
the
early
afternoon
we
were
allowed
to
proceed
to
tampa
which
we
reached
in
three
hours
and
there
we
came
once
more
to
the
press
of
the
busy
and
indifferent
world
the
muddle
of
roofs
and
steeples
of
a
great
city
were
about
us
and
men
met
us
and
talked
to
us
but
they
had
no
leisure
for
interest
in
the
wonders
of
the
strange
land
from
which
we
had
come
and
would
not
have
cared
if
afterwards
we
were
going
to
gehenna
we
made
fast
under
a
new
structure
of
timber
and
iron
which
was
something
between
a
flour
mill
and
the
tower
of
babel
for
it
was
wan
and
powdered
and
full
of
strange
noises
and
it
had
a
habit
of
eating
in
a
mechanical
way
an
interminable
length
of
railway
trucks
wagon
after
wagon
one
every
minute
a
great
weariness
and
yearning
filled
me
that
night
the
strangulating
fumes
of
the
sulphur
clung
to
all
the
cabin
and
puffed
in
clouds
from
the
pillow
when
i
changed
sides
for
the
wagons
clanked
and
banged
till
daylight
i
sat
up
and
beat
my
breast
and
swore
i
would
leave
her
and
go
home
the
next
morning
that
inexplicable
structure
beside
us
began
from
many
mouths
to
vomit
floods
of
powdered
phosphate
into
us
and
the
capella
in
and
out
turned
pale
through
an
almost
impalpable
dust
everybody
took
bronchitis
and
cursed
tampa
and
its
phosphate
i
spoke
to
the
skipper
and
the
chief
about
it
and
they
agreed
that
nobody
would
stop
with
her
now
who
could
leave
her
but
that
yet
was
i
no
pal
to
desert
them
what
about
them
they
had
yet
to
see
her
safe
across
the
most
ruthless
of
seas
at
a
time
when
its
temper
would
be
at
its
worst
and
what
about
them
though
they
admitted
that
were
they
in
my
case
they
would
certainly
take
the
train
to
new
york
and
catch
there
the
fastest
steamer
for
england
then
come
with
me
to
the
british
consul
like
an
honest
man
said
i
to
the
captain
and
get
me
off
your
articles
the
three
of
us
left
her
i
for
the
last
time
i
turned
upon
the
capella
and
the
boys
stood
leaning
on
her
taffrail
watching
me
and
i
am
not
going
to
put
down
here
what
i
felt
nor
what
the
lads
cried
to
me
nor
what
i
said
when
i
stood
beneath
her
counter
and
called
up
to
them
we
came
to
a
corner
by
a
warehouse
and
i
turned
to
look
upon
the
capella
for
the
last
time
tampa
the
noisy
city
about
us
was
rawly
new
most
of
its
site
but
lately
a
shallow
lagoon
and
one
of
its
natives
the
ship
s
agent
who
was
entertaining
us
at
lunch
did
not
fail
to
impress
that
enterprise
and
industry
upon
us
with
great
earnestness
tampa
was
a
large
hasty
makeshift
standing
of
depôts
railway
sidings
cigar
factories
wharves
and
huge
elevators
which
could
load
i
forget
how
many
thousands
of
tons
of
bulk
cargo
into
a
steamer
in
twelve
hours
as
though
she
were
an
iron
bucket
under
a
pump
a
town
spontaneous
unexpected
and
complete
with
a
hurrying
population
in
its
sidewalks
pushing
to
secure
foothold
in
life
and
not
a
there
and
no
talk
but
in
its
saloons
and
commercial
exchanges
we
went
into
many
of
those
saloons
the
skipper
and
the
chief
and
the
late
purser
shaking
hands
for
the
last
time
in
each
and
then
dropping
into
another
to
recall
old
affairs
and
shaking
hands
finally
again
and
so
to
the
next
bar
that
night
i
was
alone
in
tampa
with
a
torrent
of
urgent
affairs
surging
past
i
could
not
find
the
railway
station
standing
at
a
corner
outside
a
tobacconist
s
shop
a
huge
corridor
train
shaped
among
the
lights
of
the
street
trundled
down
the
centre
of
the
roadway
then
edged
close
to
the
sidewalk
bumping
past
a
row
of
shops
as
casually
as
a
tram
for
a
penny
journey
and
stopped
just
where
i
stood
with
a
wondering
how
i
was
to
get
to
new
york
new
york
was
a
thousand
miles
away
the
train
was
but
a
mere
episode
of
the
open
street
and
i
could
not
feel
it
bore
out
the
promise
of
my
railway
vouchers
this
train
a
row
of
lighted
villas
in
motion
came
down
the
roadway
out
of
nowhere
while
carts
and
women
with
market
baskets
waited
for
it
to
pass
stopped
outside
a
tobacconist
s
shop
and
the
light
of
the
shop
window
illuminated
a
round
of
a
huge
wheel
which
stood
higher
than
my
head
the
wheel
came
to
rest
upon
an
abandoned
newspaper
a
negro
was
passing
me
and
i
stopped
him
noo
yark
step
aboard
right
now
his
word
was
all
i
had
to
go
upon
that
this
train
would
take
me
to
the
precise
point
in
a
continent
i
did
not
know
a
struggle
for
existence
eddied
fiercely
round
the
train
and
assuming
it
was
the
right
train
and
i
missed
was
an
unbearable
thought
the
train
had
to
be
mounted
it
was
like
climbing
a
wall
but
i
would
have
cast
my
luggage
scaled
more
than
walls
and
dealt
conclusively
with
any
obstruction
if
the
way
home
left
me
no
other
choice
the
traveller
who
has
been
in
the
wilds
and
has
lived
with
the
barbarous
though
he
has
not
allowed
his
thoughts
to
look
back
there
yet
he
knows
something
of
that
eagerness
which
dumb
things
feel
when
he
turns
about
i
took
my
train
on
trust
as
one
does
so
many
things
in
the
united
states
found
we
should
really
get
to
new
york
in
time
and
lay
listening
to
the
beat
of
the
flying
wheels
beneath
my
berth
tried
to
count
their
pulse
and
fell
asleep
there
were
some
more
days
and
nights
and
all
the
passengers
of
the
earlier
stages
of
the
journey
had
passed
away
then
the
train
slowed
through
imperceptible
gradations
and
stopped
i
thought
a
cow
was
on
the
line
but
the
negro
attendant
came
to
me
and
told
me
to
get
out
this
was
new
york
outside
there
was
a
street
in
the
rain
the
stones
were
deep
with
yellow
reflections
and
some
cabmen
stood
about
in
shiny
capes
no
majestic
figure
of
liberty
met
me
a
cab
met
me
on
a
rainy
night
it
was
on
one
of
those
huge
liners
and
the
steward
told
him
they
would
reach
plymouth
in
the
morning
he
was
packing
up
his
things
in
his
cabin
england
the
things
went
into
his
trunks
in
the
lump
with
a
compressing
foot
after
each
it
did
not
matter
all
the
clothes
were
in
ruins
the
only
care
he
took
was
with
the
toucans
brilliant
skins
the
bundle
of
arrows
the
biscuit
tins
full
of
would
excite
the
the
barbaric
indian
ornaments
for
miss
muffet
and
the
curly
nob
how
their
eyes
would
shine
his
telegram
from
plymouth
would
surprise
them
they
did
not
know
where
he
was
but
he
knew
when
they
did
not
that
there
was
but
one
more
day
to
tick
off
the
calendar
to
complete
the
exile
he
had
turned
back
that
day
to
the
earlier
pages
of
the
diary
and
found
some
illuminating
entries
gone
or
that
s
another
were
written
across
some
spaces
which
otherwise
were
blank
it
was
curious
that
those
cryptic
entries
recalled
the
hours
they
stood
for
more
vividly
to
his
mind
than
those
which
had
happenings
minutely
recorded
he
threw
the
diary
into
a
trunk
the
long
job
was
finished
the
sunshine
all
that
day
was
different
from
the
well
remembered
burning
weight
of
the
tropics
it
was
a
frail
and
grateful
spring
warmth
and
the
incidence
of
its
rays
was
happy
and
illuminating
as
though
the
light
had
only
just
reached
the
world
and
so
things
looked
just
discovered
and
interesting
a
faint
silver
haze
hung
upon
a
pallid
sea
and
the
slow
smooth
mounds
of
water
were
full
of
fugitive
glints
and
flashes
you
hardly
knew
the
sea
was
there
the
mist
was
the
luminous
nimbus
of
a
new
world
a
world
not
yet
fully
formed
for
it
had
no
visible
bounds
night
came
and
a
nearly
full
moon
and
the
only
reality
was
the
stupendous
bulk
of
the
liner
she
might
have
been
in
the
clouds
herself
a
dark
cloud
near
the
moon
with
but
rumours
of
light
in
the
aerial
deeps
beneath
it
seemed
another
of
the
dreams
would
he
wake
up
presently
to
the
reality
of
the
forest
with
the
sun
blazing
on
the
enamel
of
its
hard
foliage
he
wanted
some
assurance
of
time
and
space
he
would
stay
on
deck
till
the
first
sign
came
of
england
so
he
leaned
motionless
for
hours
on
the
rail
of
the
gazing
ahead
where
the
outlook
remained
as
unshapen
as
it
had
since
he
left
home
far
on
the
port
bow
appeared
the
headlight
of
a
steamer
he
watched
that
light
this
then
was
no
dream
sea
others
were
there
but
was
it
a
headlight
no
the
bishop
s
england
now
the
steward
came
again
peeping
through
his
curtain
and
said
plymouth
sir
and
turned
on
the
glow
lamp
for
it
was
not
yet
dawn
there
was
an
early
breakfast
laid
in
the
saloon
but
he
went
on
deck
the
liner
had
hardly
way
on
her
the
water
was
but
uncoiling
noiselessly
alongside
there
were
shapes
of
hills
near
with
villas
painted
on
them
but
so
bluish
and
immaterial
was
all
that
it
might
have
rippled
like
the
flat
water
being
but
a
flimsy
background
which
could
be
easily
shaken
the
hills
drew
nearer
imperceptibly
grew
higher
a
touch
of
real
day
gave
a
body
and
there
was
a
confident
shout
from
somebody
unseen
in
plain
english
the
vision
grounded
and
got
substance
not
only
home
but
spring
in
devon
from
the
train
window
the
countryside
in
the
tones
and
flush
of
the
renascence
absorbed
him
he
went
from
side
to
side
of
the
carriage
what
was
most
extraordinary
was
the
sparsity
and
lowness
of
the
trees
and
bushes
the
fineness
of
the
growth
the
outlines
of
the
trees
could
be
seen
and
they
crouched
so
near
to
the
ground
and
were
so
very
meagre
the
colours
were
faint
enough
to
be
but
tinted
mists
the
biggest
of
the
trees
were
manageable
looked
like
toys
the
orderly
hedges
the
clean
roads
the
geometrical
patterns
of
the
fields
gave
him
assurance
once
more
of
order
and
security
here
was
law
again
and
the
permanence
of
affairs
long
decided
upon
he
closed
his
eyes
sinking
into
the
cushions
of
the
carriage
as
though
the
arms
under
him
were
proved
friendly
and
could
be
trusted
the
slowing
of
the
train
woke
him
they
were
running
into
paddington
he
got
his
feet
fair
and
solid
on
london
before
the
train
stopped
and
looked
into
the
crowd
waiting
there
a
flushed
youngster
ran
towards
him
out
of
a
group
then
stopped
shyly
he
caught
the
boy
and
held
him
up
here
again
was
the
centre
of
the
world
the
end
