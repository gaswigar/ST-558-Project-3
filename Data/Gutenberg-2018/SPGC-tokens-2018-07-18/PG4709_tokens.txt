chapter
i
a
birthday
dinner
the
little
sons
of
the
rich
were
gathered
about
the
long
table
in
pettingill
studio
there
were
nine
of
them
present
besides
brewster
they
were
all
young
more
or
less
enterprising
hopeful
and
reasonably
sure
of
better
things
to
come
most
of
them
bore
names
that
meant
something
in
the
story
of
new
york
indeed
one
of
them
had
remarked
a
man
is
known
by
the
street
that
named
after
him
and
as
he
was
a
new
member
they
called
him
subway
the
most
popular
man
in
the
company
was
young
monty
brewster
he
was
tall
and
straight
and
people
called
him
older
women
were
interested
in
him
because
his
father
and
mother
had
made
a
romantic
runaway
match
which
was
the
talk
of
the
town
in
the
seventies
and
had
never
been
forgiven
worldly
women
were
interested
in
him
because
he
was
the
only
grandson
of
edwin
peter
brewster
who
was
many
times
a
millionaire
and
monty
was
fairly
certain
to
be
his
heir
barring
an
gift
to
charity
younger
women
were
interested
for
a
much
more
obvious
and
simple
reason
they
liked
him
men
also
took
to
monty
because
he
was
a
good
sportsman
a
man
among
men
because
he
had
a
decent
respect
for
himself
and
no
great
aversion
to
work
his
father
and
mother
had
both
died
while
he
was
still
a
child
and
as
if
to
make
up
for
his
long
relentlessness
the
grandfather
had
taken
the
boy
to
his
own
house
and
had
cared
for
him
with
what
he
called
affection
after
college
and
some
months
on
the
continent
however
monty
had
preferred
to
be
independent
old
brewster
had
found
him
a
place
in
the
bank
but
beyond
this
and
occasional
dinners
monty
asked
for
and
received
no
favors
it
was
a
question
of
work
and
hard
work
and
small
pay
he
lived
on
his
salary
because
he
had
to
but
he
did
not
resent
his
grandfather
attitude
he
was
better
satisfied
to
spend
his
weakly
salary
as
he
called
it
in
his
own
way
than
to
earn
more
by
dining
seven
nights
a
week
with
an
old
man
who
had
forgotten
he
was
ever
young
it
was
less
wearing
he
said
among
the
little
sons
of
the
rich
birthdays
were
always
occasions
for
feasting
the
table
was
covered
with
dishes
sent
up
from
the
french
restaurant
in
the
basement
the
chairs
were
pushed
back
cigarettes
were
lighted
men
had
their
knees
crossed
then
pettingill
got
up
gentlemen
he
began
we
are
here
to
celebrate
the
birthday
of
montgomery
brewster
i
ask
you
all
to
join
me
in
drinking
to
his
long
life
and
happiness
no
heel
taps
some
one
shouted
brewster
brewster
all
called
at
once
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
the
sudden
ringing
of
an
electric
bell
cut
off
this
flow
of
sentiment
and
so
unusual
was
the
interruption
that
the
ten
members
straightened
up
as
if
jerked
into
position
by
a
string
the
police
some
one
suggested
all
faces
were
turned
toward
the
door
a
waiter
stood
there
uncertain
whether
to
turn
the
knob
or
push
the
bolt
damned
nuisance
said
richard
van
winkle
i
want
to
hear
speech
speech
speech
echoed
everywhere
men
settled
into
their
places
montgomery
brewster
pettingill
introduced
again
the
bell
rang
long
and
loud
reinforcements
i
bet
there
a
patrol
in
the
street
remarked
oliver
harrison
if
it
only
the
police
let
them
in
said
pettingill
i
thought
it
was
a
creditor
the
waiter
opened
the
door
some
one
to
see
brewster
sir
he
announced
is
she
pretty
waiter
called
mccloud
he
says
he
is
ellis
from
your
grandfather
sir
my
compliments
to
ellis
and
ask
him
to
inform
my
grandfather
that
it
after
banking
hours
i
see
him
in
the
morning
said
brewster
who
had
reddened
under
the
jests
of
his
companions
grandpa
does
want
his
monty
to
stay
out
after
dark
chuckled
subway
smith
it
was
most
thoughtful
of
the
old
gentleman
to
have
the
man
call
for
you
with
the
perambulator
shouted
pettingill
above
the
laughter
tell
him
you
already
had
your
bottle
added
mccloud
waiter
tell
ellis
i
too
busy
to
be
seen
commanded
brewster
and
as
ellis
went
down
in
the
elevator
a
roar
followed
him
now
for
brewster
speech
brewster
monty
rose
gentlemen
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
i
am
years
old
this
day
and
that
your
remarks
have
been
childish
and
wholly
unbecoming
the
dignity
of
my
age
that
i
have
arrived
at
a
period
of
discretion
is
evident
from
my
choice
of
friends
that
i
am
entitled
to
your
respect
is
evident
from
my
notorious
wealth
you
have
done
me
the
honor
to
drink
my
health
and
to
reassure
me
as
to
the
inoffensiveness
of
approaching
senility
now
i
ask
you
all
to
rise
and
drink
to
little
sons
of
the
rich
may
the
lord
love
us
an
hour
later
rip
van
winkle
and
subway
smith
were
singing
tell
me
pretty
maiden
to
the
uncertain
accompaniment
of
pettingill
violin
when
the
electric
bell
again
disturbed
the
company
for
heaven
sake
shouted
harrison
who
had
been
singing
with
all
thy
faults
i
love
thee
still
to
pettingill
lay
figure
come
home
with
me
grandson
come
home
with
me
now
suggested
subway
smith
tell
ellis
to
go
to
halifax
commanded
montgomery
and
again
ellis
took
the
elevator
downward
his
usually
impassive
face
now
wore
a
look
of
anxiety
and
twice
he
started
to
return
to
the
top
floor
shaking
his
head
dubiously
at
last
he
climbed
into
a
hansom
and
reluctantly
left
the
revelers
behind
he
knew
it
was
a
birthday
celebration
and
it
was
only
twelve
in
the
morning
at
three
the
elevator
made
another
trip
to
the
top
floor
and
ellis
rushed
over
to
the
unfriendly
doorbell
this
time
there
was
stubborn
determination
in
his
face
the
singing
ceased
and
a
roar
of
laughter
followed
the
hush
of
a
moment
or
two
come
in
called
a
hearty
voice
and
ellis
strode
firmly
into
the
studio
you
are
just
in
time
for
a
ellis
cried
harrison
rushing
to
the
footman
side
ellis
stolidly
facing
the
young
man
lifted
his
hand
no
thank
you
sir
he
said
respectfully
montgomery
if
excuse
me
for
breaking
in
i
like
to
give
you
three
messages
brought
here
you
a
faithful
old
chap
said
subway
smith
thickly
hanged
if
i
do
work
till
three
for
anybody
i
came
at
ten
montgomery
with
a
message
from
brewster
wishing
you
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
and
with
a
check
from
him
for
one
thousand
dollars
here

check
sir
i
give
my
messages
in
the
order
i
received
them
sir
if

i
came
with
a
message
from
gower
sir
who
had
been
called
in
called

gasped
montgomery
turning
white
yes
sir
brewster
had
a
sudden
heart
attack
at
eleven
sir
the
doctor

by
me
sir
that
he

point
of

my
last

the
butler
asking

brewster
house
at
once
if
you
can
sir
i
mean
if
you
will
sir
ellis
interjected
apologetically
then
with
his
gaze
directed
steadily
over
the
heads
of
the
subdued
sons
he
added
impressively
brewster
is
dead
sir
chapter
ii
shades
of
aladdin
montgomery
brewster
no
longer
had
prospects
people
could
not
now
point
him
out
with
the
remark
that
some
day
he
would
come
into
a
million
or
two
he
had
realized
as
oliver
harrison
would
have
put
it
two
days
after
his
grandfather
funeral
a
final
will
and
testament
was
read
and
as
was
expected
the
old
banker
atoned
for
the
hardships
robert
brewster
and
his
wife
had
endured
by
bequeathing
one
million
dollars
to
their
son
montgomery
it
was
his
without
a
restriction
without
an
admonition
without
an
incumbrance
there
was
not
a
suggestion
as
to
how
it
should
be
handled
by
the
heir
the
business
training
the
old
man
had
given
him
was
synonymous
with
conditions
not
expressed
in
the
will
the
dead
man
believed
that
he
had
drilled
into
the
youth
an
unmistakable
conception
of
what
was
expected
of
him
in
life
if
he
failed
in
these
expectations
the
misfortune
would
be
his
alone
to
bear
a
road
had
been
carved
out
for
him
and
behind
him
stretched
a
long
line
of
whose
laconic
instructions
might
be
ignored
but
never
forgotten
edwin
peter
brewster
evidently
made
his
will
with
the
sensible
conviction
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
die
before
anybody
else
could
possess
his
money
and
that
once
dead
it
would
be
folly
for
him
to
worry
over
the
way
in
which
beneficiaries
might
choose
to
manage
their
own
affairs
the
house
in
fifth
avenue
went
to
a
sister
together
with
a
million
or
two
and
the
residue
of
the
estate
found
kindly
disposed
relatives
who
were
willing
to
keep
it
from
going
to
the
home
for
friendless
fortunes
old
brewster
left
his
affairs
in
order
the
will
nominated
jerome
buskirk
as
executor
and
he
was
instructed
in
conclusion
to
turn
over
to
montgomery
brewster
the
day
after
the
will
was
probated
securities
to
the
amount
of
one
million
dollars
provided
for
in
clause
four
of
the
instrument
and
so
it
was
that
on
the
of
september
young
brewster
had
an
unconditional
fortune
thrust
upon
him
weighted
only
with
the
suggestion
of
crepe
that
clung
to
it
since
his
grandfather
death
he
had
been
staying
at
the
gloomy
old
brewster
house
in
fifth
avenue
paying
but
two
or
three
hurried
visits
to
the
rooms
at
gray
where
he
had
made
his
home
the
gloom
of
death
still
darkened
the
fifth
avenue
place
and
there
was
a
stillness
a
gentle
stealthiness
about
the
house
that
made
him
long
for
more
cheerful
companionship
he
wondered
dimly
if
a
fortune
always
carried
the
suggestion
of
the
richness
and
strangeness
of
it
all
hung
about
him
unpleasantly
he
had
had
no
extravagant
affection
for
the
grim
old
dictator
who
was
dead
yet
his
grandfather
was
a
man
and
had
commanded
his
respect
it
seemed
brutal
to
leave
him
out
of
the
reckoning
to
dance
on
the
grave
of
the
mentor
who
had
treated
him
well
the
attitude
of
the
friends
who
clapped
him
on
the
back
of
the
newspapers
which
congratulated
him
of
the
crowd
that
expected
him
to
rejoice
repelled
him
it
seemed
a
tragic
comedy
haunted
by
a
severe
dead
face
he
was
haunted
too
by
memories
and
by
a
sharp
regret
for
his
own
foolish
thoughtlessness
even
the
fortune
itself
weighed
upon
him
at
moments
with
a
melancholy
yet
the
situation
was
not
without
its
compensations
for
several
days
when
ellis
called
him
at
seven
he
would
answer
him
and
thank
fortune
that
he
was
not
required
at
the
bank
that
morning
the
luxury
of
another
hour
of
sleep
seemed
the
greatest
perquisite
of
wealth
his
morning
mail
amused
him
at
first
for
since
the
newspapers
had
published
his
prosperity
to
the
world
he
was
deluged
with
letters
requests
for
public
or
private
charity
were
abundant
but
most
of
his
correspondents
were
generous
and
thought
only
of
his
own
good
for
three
days
he
was
in
a
hopeless
state
of
bewilderment
he
was
visited
by
reporters
photographers
and
ingenious
strangers
who
benevolently
offered
to
invest
his
money
in
enterprises
with
certified
futures
when
he
was
not
engaged
in
declining
a
gold
mine
in
colorado
worth
five
million
dollars
marked
down
to
four
hundred
and
fifty
he
was
avoiding
a
guileless
inventor
who
offered
to
sacrifice
the
secrets
of
a
marvelous
device
for
three
hundred
dollars
or
denying
the
report
that
he
had
been
tendered
the
presidency
of
the
first
national
bank
oliver
harrison
stirred
him
out
early
one
morning
and
while
the
sleepy
millionaire
was
rubbing
his
eyes
and
still
dodging
the
bombshell
that
a
dream
anarchist
had
hurled
from
the
pinnacle
of
a
bedpost
urged
him
in
excited
confidential
tones
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
and
prepare
for
possible
breach
of
promise
suits
brewster
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
listened
to
diabolical
stories
of
how
conscienceless
females
had
fleeced
innocent
and
even
godly
men
of
wealth
from
the
bathroom
between
splashes
he
retained
harrison
by
the
year
month
day
and
hour
to
stand
between
him
and
blackmail
the
directors
of
the
bank
met
and
adopted
resolutions
lamenting
the
death
of
their
late
president
passed
the
leadership
on
to
the
first
and
speedily
adjourned
the
question
of
admitting
monty
to
the
directory
was
brought
up
and
discussed
but
it
was
left
for
time
to
settle
one
of
the
directors
was
prentiss
drew
the
railroad
magnate
of
the
newspapers
he
had
shown
a
fondness
for
young
brewster
and
monty
had
been
a
frequent
visitor
at
his
house
colonel
drew
called
him
my
dear
boy
and
monty
called
him
a
bully
old
chap
though
not
in
his
presence
but
the
existence
of
miss
barbara
drew
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
feeling
between
the
two
men
as
he
left
the
directors
room
on
the
afternoon
of
the
meeting
colonel
drew
came
up
to
monty
who
had
notified
the
officers
of
the
bank
that
he
was
leaving
ah
my
dear
boy
said
the
colonel
shaking
the
young
man
hand
warmly
now
you
have
a
chance
to
show
what
you
can
do
you
have
a
fortune
and
with
judgment
you
ought
to
be
able
to
triple
it
if
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
come
and
see
me
monty
thanked
him
you
be
bored
to
death
by
the
raft
of
people
who
have
ways
to
spend
your
money
continued
the
colonel
do
listen
to
any
of
them
take
your
time
you
have
a
new
chance
to
make
money
every
day
of
your
life
so
go
slowly
i
have
been
rich
years
and
years
ago
if
i
had
sense
enough
to
run
away
from
promoters
they
all
try
to
get
a
whack
at
your
money
keep
your
eye
open
monty
the
rich
young
man
is
always
a
tempting
morsel
after
a
moment
reflection
he
added
wo
you
come
out
and
dine
with
us
night
chapter
iii
and
miss
gray
gray
lived
in
fortieth
street
for
years
montgomery
brewster
had
regarded
her
quiet
home
as
his
own
the
house
had
once
been
her
grandfather
and
it
was
one
of
the
pioneers
in
that
part
of
the
town
it
was
there
she
was
born
in
its
quaint
old
parlor
she
was
married
and
all
her
girlhood
her
brief
wedded
life
and
her
widowhood
were
connected
with
it
gray
and
montgomery
mother
had
been
schoolmates
and
playmates
and
their
friendship
endured
when
old
edwin
peter
brewster
looked
about
for
a
place
to
house
his
orphaned
grandson
gray
begged
him
to
let
her
care
for
the
little
fellow
he
was
three
years
older
than
her
margaret
and
the
children
grew
up
as
brother
and
sister
brewster
was
generous
in
providing
for
the
boy
while
he
was
away
at
college
spending
money
in
a
manner
that
caused
the
old
gentleman
to
marvel
at
his
own
liberality
gray
was
well
paid
for
the
unused
but
apartments
and
there
never
was
a
murmur
of
complaint
from
edwin
peter
brewster
he
was
hard
but
he
was
not
niggardly
it
had
been
something
of
a
struggle
for
gray
to
make
both
ends
meet
the
property
in
fortieth
street
was
her
only
possession
but
little
money
had
come
to
her
at
her
husband
death
and
an
unfortunate
speculation
of
his
had
swept
away
all
that
had
fallen
to
her
from
her
father
the
late
judge
merriweather
for
years
she
kept
the
old
home
unencumbered
teaching
french
and
english
until
margaret
was
well
in
her
teens
the
girl
was
sent
to
one
of
the
good
old
on
the
hudson
and
came
out
well
prepared
to
help
her
mother
in
the
battle
to
keep
the
wolf
down
and
appearances
up
margaret
was
rich
in
friendships
and
pride
alone
stood
between
her
and
the
advantages
they
offered
bright
and
cheerful
she
knew
no
natural
privations
with
a
heart
as
light
and
joyous
as
a
may
morning
she
faced
adversity
as
though
it
was
a
pleasure
and
no
one
would
have
suspected
that
even
for
a
moment
her
courage
wavered
now
that
brewster
had
come
into
his
splendid
fortune
he
could
conceive
no
greater
delight
than
to
share
it
with
them
to
walk
into
the
little
and
serenely
lay
large
sums
before
them
as
their
own
seemed
such
a
natural
proceeding
that
he
refused
to
see
an
obstacle
but
he
knew
it
was
there
the
proffer
of
such
a
gift
to
gray
would
mean
a
wound
to
the
pride
inherited
from
haughty
generations
of
men
sufficient
unto
themselves
there
was
a
small
but
troublesome
mortgage
on
the
house
a
matter
of
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
and
brewster
tried
to
evolve
a
plan
by
which
he
could
assume
the
burden
without
giving
deep
and
lasting
offense
a
hundred
wild
designs
had
come
to
him
but
they
were
quickly
relegated
to
the
growing
heap
of
subterfuges
and
pretexts
condemned
by
his
tenderness
for
the
pride
of
these
two
women
who
meant
so
much
to
him
leaving
the
bank
he
hastened
by
electric
car
to
fortieth
street
and
broadway
and
then
walked
eagerly
off
into
the
street
of
the
numeral
he
had
not
yet
come
to
the
point
where
he
felt
like
scorning
the
cars
even
though
a
roll
of
banknotes
was
tucked
snugly
away
in
a
pocket
that
seemed
to
swell
with
sudden
affluence
old
hendrick
faithful
servitor
through
two
generations
was
sweeping
the
autumn
leaves
from
the
sidewalk
when
montgomery
came
up
to
the
house
hello
hendrick
was
the
young
man
cheery
greeting
nice
lot
of
leaves
you
have
there
so
ebbed
from
hendrick
who
did
not
even
so
much
as
look
up
from
his
work
hendrick
was
a
human
clam
gray
in
a
grunt
that
signified
yes
you
as
loquacious
as
ever
hendrick
a
mere
nod
brewster
let
himself
in
with
his
own
latch
key
threw
his
hat
on
a
chair
and
unceremoniously
bolted
into
the
library
margaret
was
seated
near
a
window
a
book
in
her
lap
the
first
evidence
of
unbiased
friendship
he
had
seen
in
days
shone
in
her
smile
she
took
his
hand
and
said
simply
we
are
glad
to
welcome
the
prodigal
to
his
home
again
i
remind
myself
more
of
the
fatted
calf
his
first
had
gone
i
thought
of
that
but
i
did
dare
say
it
she
laughed
one
must
be
respectful
to
rich
relatives
hang
your
rich
relatives
peggy
if
i
thought
that
this
money
would
make
any
difference
i
would
give
it
up
this
minute
nonsense
monty
she
said
how
could
it
make
a
difference
but
you
must
admit
it
is
rather
startling
the
friend
of
our
youth
leaves
his
humble
dwelling
saturday
night
with
his
salary
drawn
for
two
weeks
ahead
he
returns
the
following
thursday
a
dazzling
millionaire
i
glad
i
begun
to
dazzle
anyway
i
thought
it
might
be
hard
to
look
the
part
well
i
ca
see
that
you
are
much
changed
there
was
a
suggestion
of
a
quaver
in
her
voice
and
the
shadows
did
not
prevent
him
from
seeing
the
quick
mist
that
flitted
across
her
deep
eyes
after
all
it
easy
work
being
a
millionaire
he
explained
when
you
always
had
inclinations
and
possibilities
she
added
really
though
i
never
get
as
much
joy
out
of
my
abundant
riches
as
i
did
out
of
financial
embarrassments
but
think
how
fine
it
is
monty
not
ever
to
wonder
where
your
winter
overcoat
is
to
come
from
and
how
long
the
coal
will
last
and
all
that
oh
i
never
wondered
about
my
overcoats
the
tailor
did
the
wondering
but
i
wish
i
could
go
on
living
here
just
as
before
i
a
heap
rather
live
here
than
at
that
gloomy
place
on
the
avenue
that
sounded
like
the
things
you
used
to
say
when
we
played
in
the
garret
you
a
heap
sooner
do
this
than
that
do
you
remember
that
just
why
i
rather
live
here
peggy
last
night
i
fell
to
thinking
of
that
old
garret
and
hanged
if
something
did
come
up
and
stick
in
my
throat
so
tight
that
i
wanted
to
cry
how
long
has
it
been
since
we
played
up
there
yes
and
how
long
has
it
been
since
i
read
optic
to
you
lying
there
in
the
garret
window
while
you
sat
with
your
back
against
the
wall
your
blue
eyes
as
big
as
dollars
oh
dear
me
monty
it
was
ages
ago
twelve
or
thirteen
years
at
least
she
cried
a
soft
light
in
her
eyes
i
going
up
there
this
afternoon
to
see
what
the
place
is
like
he
said
eagerly
and
peggy
you
must
come
too
maybe
i
can
find
one
of
those
optic
books
and
we
be
young
again
just
for
old
time
sake
she
said
impulsively
you
stay
for
luncheon
too
i
have
to
be
at
the
no
i
wo
either
do
you
know
i
was
thinking
i
had
to
be
at
the
bank
at
to
let
perkins
go
out
for
something
to
eat
the
millionaire
habit
is
so
firmly
fixed
as
i
supposed
after
a
moment
pause
in
which
his
growing
seriousness
changed
the
atmosphere
he
went
on
haltingly
uncertain
of
his
position
the
nicest
thing
about
having
all
this
money
is
that
that
we
wo
have
to
deny
ourselves
anything
after
this
it
did
not
sound
very
tactful
now
that
it
was
out
and
he
was
compelled
to
scrutinize
rather
intently
a
familiar
portrait
in
order
to
maintain
an
air
of
careless
assurance
she
did
not
respond
to
this
venture
but
he
felt
that
she
was
looking
directly
into
his
brain
we
do
any
amount
of
decorating
about
the
house
and
and
you
know
that
furnace
has
been
giving
us
a
lot
of
trouble
for
two
or
three
years
he
was
pouring
out
ruthlessly
when
her
hand
fell
gently
on
his
own
and
she
stood
straight
and
tall
before
him
an
odd
look
in
her
eyes
do
please
do
go
on
monty
she
said
very
gently
but
without
wavering
i
know
what
you
mean
you
are
good
and
very
thoughtful
monty
but
you
really
must
not
why
what
mine
is
yours
he
began
i
know
you
are
generous
monty
and
i
know
you
have
a
heart
you
want
us
to
to
take
some
of
your
money
it
was
not
easy
to
say
it
and
as
for
monty
he
could
only
look
at
the
floor
we
can
not
monty
dear
you
must
never
speak
of
it
again
mamma
and
i
had
a
feeling
that
you
would
do
it
but
do
you
see
even
from
you
it
is
an
offer
of
help
and
it
hurts
do
talk
like
that
peggy
he
implored
it
would
break
her
heart
if
you
offered
to
give
her
money
in
that
way
she
hate
it
monty
it
is
foolish
perhaps
but
you
know
we
take
your
money
i
thought
you
that
you
oh
this
knocks
all
the
joy
out
of
it
he
burst
out
desperately
dear
monty
let
talk
it
over
peggy
you
do
understand
he
began
dashing
at
what
he
thought
would
be
a
break
in
her
resolve
do
she
commanded
and
in
her
blue
eyes
was
the
hot
flash
he
had
felt
once
or
twice
before
he
rose
and
walked
across
the
floor
back
and
forth
again
and
then
stood
before
her
a
smile
on
his
lips
a
rather
pitiful
smile
but
still
a
smile
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
it
a
confounded
puritanical
prejudice
peggy
he
said
in
futile
protest
and
you
know
it
you
have
not
seen
the
letters
that
came
for
you
this
morning
on
the
table
over
there
she
replied
ignoring
him
he
found
the
letters
and
resumed
his
seat
in
the
window
glancing
over
the
contents
of
the
envelopes
the
last
was
from
grant
ripley
attorneys
and
even
from
his
abstraction
it
brought
a
surprised
by
jove
he
read
it
aloud
to
margaret
september
montgomery
brewster
new
york
dear
sir
we
are
in
receipt
of
a
communication
from
swearengen
jones
of
montana
conveying
the
sad
intelligence
that
your
uncle
james
sedgwick
died
on
the
inst
at
m
hospital
in
portland
after
a
brief
illness
jones
by
this
time
has
qualified
in
montana
as
the
executor
of
your
uncle
will
and
has
retained
us
as
his
eastern
representatives
he
incloses
a
copy
of
the
will
in
which
you
are
named
as
sole
heir
with
conditions
attending
will
you
call
at
our
office
this
afternoon
if
it
is
convenient
it
is
important
that
you
know
the
contents
of
the
instrument
at
once
respectfully
yours
grant
ripley
for
a
moment
there
was
only
amazement
in
the
air
then
a
faint
bewildered
smile
appeared
in
monty
face
and
reflected
itself
in
the
girl
who
is
your
uncle
james
she
asked
i
never
heard
of
him
you
must
go
to
grant
ripley
at
once
of
course
have
you
forgotten
peggy
he
replied
with
a
hint
of
vexation
in
his
voice
that
we
are
to
read
optic
this
afternoon
chapter
iv
a
second
you
are
both
fortunate
and
unfortunate
brewster
said
grant
after
the
young
man
had
dropped
into
a
chair
in
the
office
of
grant
ripley
the
next
day
montgomery
wore
a
slightly
bored
expression
and
it
was
evident
that
he
took
little
interest
in
the
will
of
james
sedgwick
from
far
back
in
the
recesses
of
memory
he
now
recalled
this
brother
of
his
mother
as
a
very
small
child
he
had
seen
his
uncle
james
upon
the
few
occasions
which
brought
him
to
the
home
of
and
robert
brewster
but
the
young
man
had
dined
at
the
drews
the
night
before
and
barbara
had
had
more
charm
for
him
than
usual
it
was
of
her
that
he
was
thinking
when
he
walked
into
the
office
of
swearengen
jones
lawyers
the
truth
is
grant
i
completely
forgotten
the
existence
of
an
uncle
he
responded
it
is
not
surprising
said
grant
genially
every
one
who
knew
him
in
new
york
nineteen
or
twenty
years
ago
believed
him
to
be
dead
he
left
the
city
when
you
were
a
very
small
lad
going
to
australia
i
think
he
was
off
to
seek
his
fortune
and
he
needed
it
pretty
badly
when
he
started
out
this
letter
from
jones
comes
like
a
message
from
the
dead
were
it
not
that
we
have
known
jones
for
a
long
time
handling
affairs
of
considerable
importance
for
him
i
should
feel
inclined
to
doubt
the
whole
story
it
seems
that
your
uncle
turned
up
in
montana
about
fifteen
years
ago
and
there
formed
a
stanch
friendship
with
old
swearengen
jones
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
far
west
sedgwick
will
was
signed
on
the
day
of
his
death
september
and
it
was
quite
natural
that
jones
should
be
named
as
his
executor
that
is
how
we
became
interested
in
the
matter
mr
brewster
i
see
said
montgomery
somewhat
puzzled
but
why
do
you
say
that
i
am
both
fortunate
and
unfortunate
the
situation
is
so
remarkable
that
you
consider
that
a
mild
way
of
putting
it
when
you
heard
everything
i
think
you
were
told
in
our
note
of
yesterday
that
you
are
the
sole
heir
well
it
may
surprise
you
to
learn
that
james
sedgwick
died
possessed
of
an
estate
valued
at
almost
seven
million
dollars
montgomery
brewster
sat
like
one
petrified
staring
blankly
at
the
old
lawyer
who
could
say
startling
things
in
a
level
voice
he
owned
gold
mines
and
ranches
in
the
northwest
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
their
value
jones
in
his
letter
to
us
briefly
outlines
the
history
of
james
sedgwick
from
the
time
he
landed
in
montana
he
reached
there
in
from
australia
and
he
was
worth
thirty
or
forty
thousand
dollars
at
the
time
within
five
years
he
was
the
owner
of
a
huge
ranch
and
scarcely
had
another
five
years
passed
before
he
was
part
owner
of
three
rich
gold
mines
possessions
accumulated
rapidly
everything
he
touched
turned
to
gold
he
was
shrewd
careful
and
thrifty
and
his
money
was
handled
with
all
the
skill
of
a
wall
street
financier
at
the
time
of
his
death
in
portland
he
did
not
owe
a
dollar
in
the
world
his
property
is
absolutely
unencumbered
safe
and
sound
as
a
government
bond
rather
overwhelming
is
it
the
lawyer
concluded
taking
note
of
brewster
expression
and
he
he
left
everything
to
me
with
a
proviso
ah
i
have
a
copy
of
the
will
ripley
and
i
are
the
only
persons
in
new
york
who
at
present
know
its
contents
you
i
am
sure
after
hearing
it
will
not
divulge
them
without
the
most
careful
deliberation
grant
drew
the
document
from
a
in
his
desk
adjusted
his
glasses
and
prepared
to
read
then
as
though
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
he
laid
the
paper
down
and
turned
once
more
to
brewster
it
seems
that
sedgwick
never
married
your
mother
was
his
sister
and
his
only
known
relative
of
close
connection
he
was
a
man
of
most
peculiar
temperament
but
in
full
possession
of
all
mental
faculties
you
may
find
this
will
to
be
a
strange
document
but
i
think
jones
the
executor
explains
any
mystery
that
may
be
suggested
by
its
terms
while
sedgwick
whereabouts
were
unknown
to
his
old
friends
in
new
york
it
seems
that
he
was
fully
posted
on
all
that
was
going
on
here
he
knew
that
you
were
the
only
child
of
your
mother
and
therefore
his
only
nephew
he
sets
forth
the
dates
of
your
mother
marriage
of
your
birth
of
the
death
of
robert
brewster
and
of
brewster
he
also
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
old
edwin
peter
brewster
intended
to
bequeath
a
large
fortune
to
you
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
sedgwick
was
proud
when
he
lived
in
new
york
he
was
regarded
as
the
kind
of
man
who
never
forgave
the
person
who
touched
roughly
upon
his
pride
you
know
of
course
that
your
father
married
miss
sedgwick
in
the
face
of
the
most
bitter
opposition
on
the
part
of
edwin
brewster
the
latter
refused
to
recognize
her
as
his
daughter
practically
disowned
his
son
and
heaped
the
harshest
kind
of
calumny
upon
the
sedgwicks
it
was
commonly
believed
about
town
that
jim
sedgwick
left
the
country
three
or
four
years
after
this
marriage
for
the
sole
reason
that
he
and
edwin
brewster
could
not
live
in
the
same
place
so
deep
was
his
hatred
of
the
old
man
that
he
fled
to
escape
killing
him
it
was
known
that
upon
one
occasion
he
visited
the
office
of
his
sister
enemy
for
the
purpose
of
slaying
him
but
something
prevented
he
carried
that
hatred
to
the
grave
as
you
will
see
montgomery
brewster
was
trying
to
gather
himself
together
from
within
the
fog
which
made
himself
and
the
world
unreal
i
believe
i
like
to
have
you
read
this
extraor
the
will
grant
he
said
with
an
effort
to
hold
his
nerves
in
leash
grant
cleared
his
throat
and
began
in
his
still
voice
once
he
looked
up
to
find
his
listener
eager
and
again
to
find
him
grown
indifferent
he
wondered
dimly
if
this
were
a
pose
in
brief
the
last
will
of
james
sedgwick
bequeathed
everything
real
and
personal
of
which
he
died
possessed
to
his
only
nephew
montgomery
brewster
of
new
york
son
of
robert
and
louise
sedgwick
brewster
supplementing
this
clause
there
was
a
set
of
conditions
governing
the
final
disposition
of
the
estate
the
most
extraordinary
of
these
conditions
was
the
one
which
required
the
heir
to
be
absolutely
penniless
upon
the
anniversary
of
his
birth
september
the
instrument
went
into
detail
in
respect
to
this
supreme
condition
it
set
forth
that
montgomery
brewster
was
to
have
no
other
worldly
possession
than
the
clothes
which
covered
him
on
the
september
day
named
he
was
to
begin
that
day
without
a
penny
to
his
name
without
a
single
article
of
jewelry
furniture
or
finance
that
he
could
call
his
own
or
could
thereafter
reclaim
at
nine
new
york
time
on
the
morning
of
september
the
executor
under
the
provisions
of
the
will
was
to
make
over
and
transfer
to
montgomery
brewster
all
of
the
moneys
lands
bonds
and
interests
mentioned
in
the
inventory
which
accompanied
the
will
in
the
event
that
montgomery
brewster
had
not
in
every
particular
complied
with
the
requirements
of
the
will
to
the
full
satisfaction
of
the
said
executor
swearengen
jones
the
estate
was
to
be
distributed
among
certain
institutions
of
charity
designated
in
the
instrument
underlying
this
imperative
injunction
of
james
sedgwick
was
plainly
discernible
the
motive
that
prompted
it
in
almost
so
many
words
he
declared
that
his
heir
should
not
receive
the
fortune
if
he
possessed
a
single
penny
that
had
come
to
him
in
any
shape
or
form
from
the
man
he
hated
edwin
peter
brewster
while
sedgwick
could
not
have
known
at
the
time
of
his
death
that
the
banker
had
bequeathed
one
million
dollars
to
his
grandson
it
was
more
than
apparent
that
he
expected
the
young
man
to
be
enriched
liberally
by
his
enemy
it
was
to
preclude
any
possible
chance
of
the
mingling
of
his
fortune
with
the
smallest
portion
of
edwin
brewster
that
james
sedgwick
on
his
deathbed
put
his
hand
to
this
astonishing
instrument
there
was
also
a
clause
in
which
he
undertook
to
dictate
the
conduct
of
montgomery
brewster
during
the
year
leading
up
to
his
anniversary
he
required
that
the
young
man
should
give
satisfactory
evidence
to
the
executor
that
he
was
capable
of
managing
his
affairs
shrewdly
and
wisely
that
he
possessed
the
ability
to
add
to
the
fortune
through
his
own
enterprise
that
he
should
come
to
his
anniversary
with
a
fair
name
and
a
record
free
from
anything
worse
than
mild
forms
of
dissipation
that
his
habits
be
temperate
that
he
possess
nothing
at
the
end
of
the
year
which
might
be
regarded
as
a
visible
or
invisible
asset
that
he
make
no
endowments
that
he
give
sparingly
to
charity
that
he
neither
loan
nor
give
away
money
for
fear
that
it
might
be
restored
to
him
later
that
he
live
on
the
principle
which
inspires
a
man
to
get
his
worth
be
the
expenditure
great
or
small
as
these
conditions
were
prescribed
for
but
a
single
year
in
the
life
of
the
heir
it
was
evident
that
sedgwick
did
not
intend
to
impose
any
restrictions
after
the
property
had
gone
into
his
hands
how
do
you
like
it
asked
grant
as
he
passed
the
will
to
brewster
the
latter
took
the
paper
and
glanced
over
it
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
heard
but
had
not
fully
grasped
its
meaning
it
must
be
a
joke
grant
he
said
still
groping
with
difficulty
through
the
fog
no
brewster
it
is
absolutely
genuine
here
is
a
telegram
from
the
probate
court
in
sedgwick
home
county
received
in
response
to
a
query
from
us
it
says
that
the
will
is
to
be
filed
for
probate
and
that
sedgwick
was
many
times
a
millionaire
this
statement
which
he
calls
an
inventory
enumerates
his
holdings
and
their
value
and
the
footing
shows
in
round
numbers
the
investments
you
see
are
there
is
not
a
bad
penny
in
all
those
millions
well
it
is
rather
staggering
is
it
said
montgomery
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
he
was
beginning
to
comprehend
in
more
ways
than
one
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
do
about
it
in
surprise
why
it
mine
is
it
it
is
not
yours
until
next
september
the
lawyer
quietly
said
well
i
fancy
i
can
wait
said
brewster
with
a
smile
that
cleared
the
air
but
my
dear
fellow
you
are
already
the
possessor
of
a
million
do
you
forget
that
you
are
expected
to
be
penniless
a
year
from
now
would
you
exchange
a
million
for
seven
millions
mr
grant
but
let
me
inquire
how
you
purpose
doing
it
asked
grant
mildly
why
by
the
simple
process
of
destruction
do
you
suppose
i
can
get
rid
of
a
million
in
a
year
great
scott
who
would
do
it
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
cut
a
few
purse
strings
and
there
is
but
one
natural
conclusion
i
do
mind
being
a
pauper
for
a
few
hours
on
the
of
next
september
that
is
your
plan
then
of
course
first
i
shall
substantiate
all
that
this
will
sets
forth
when
i
am
assured
that
there
can
be
no
possibility
of
mistake
in
the
extent
of
this
fortune
and
my
undisputed
claim
i
take
steps
to
get
rid
of
my
grandfather
million
in
short
order
brewster
voice
rang
true
now
the
zest
of
life
was
coming
back
grant
leaned
forward
slowly
and
his
intent
penetrating
gaze
served
as
a
check
to
the
young
fellow
enthusiasm
i
admire
and
approve
the
sagacity
which
urges
you
to
exchange
a
paltry
million
for
a
fortune
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
forgetting
the
conditions
he
said
slowly
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
it
will
be
no
easy
task
to
spend
a
million
dollars
without
in
some
way
violating
the
restrictions
in
your
uncle
will
thereby
losing
both
fortunes
chapter
v
the
message
from
jones
a
new
point
of
view
gradually
came
to
brewster
all
his
life
had
been
spent
in
wondering
how
to
get
enough
money
to
pay
his
bills
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
as
difficult
to
spend
as
to
acquire
wealth
the
thought
staggered
him
for
a
moment
then
he
cried
triumphantly
i
can
decline
to
accept
grandfather
million
you
can
not
decline
to
accept
what
is
already
yours
i
understand
that
the
money
has
been
paid
to
you
by
buskirk
you
have
a
million
dollars
brewster
and
it
can
not
be
denied
you
are
right
agreed
montgomery
dejectedly
really
grant
this
proposition
is
too
much
for
me
if
you
are
required
to
give
an
immediate
answer
i
want
to
think
it
over
it
sounds
like
a
dream
it
is
no
dream
brewster
smiled
the
lawyer
you
are
face
to
face
with
an
amazing
reality
come
in
morning
and
see
me
again
think
it
over
study
it
out
remember
the
conditions
of
the
will
and
the
conditions
that
confront
you
in
the
meantime
i
shall
write
to
jones
the
executor
and
learn
from
him
just
what
he
expects
you
to
do
in
order
to
carry
out
his
own
conception
of
the
terms
of
your
uncle
will
do
write
grant
telegraph
and
ask
him
to
wire
his
reply
a
year
is
not
very
long
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
a
moment
later
he
added
damn
these
family
feuds
why
could
uncle
james
have
relented
a
bit
he
brings
endless
trouble
on
my
innocent
head
just
because
of
a
row
before
i
was
born
he
was
a
strange
man
as
a
rule
one
does
not
carry
grudges
quite
so
far
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
his
will
is
law
in
this
case
suppose
i
succeed
in
spending
all
but
a
thousand
dollars
before
the
of
next
september
i
lose
the
seven
millions
and
be
the
next
thing
to
a
pauper
that
would
be
quite
like
getting
my
worth
it
is
a
problem
my
boy
think
it
over
very
seriously
before
you
come
to
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
meantime
we
can
establish
beyond
a
doubt
the
accuracy
of
this
inventory
by
all
means
go
ahead
and
please
urge
jones
not
to
be
too
hard
on
me
i
believe
i
risk
it
if
the
restrictions
are
not
too
severe
but
if
jones
has
puritanical
instincts
i
might
as
well
give
up
hope
and
be
satisfied
with
what
i
have
jones
is
very
far
from
what
you
call
puritanical
but
he
is
intensely
practical
and
he
will
undoubtedly
require
you
to
keep
an
expense
account
and
to
show
some
sort
of
receipt
for
every
dollar
you
disburse
good
lord
itemize
in
a
general
way
i
presume
i
have
to
employ
an
army
of
spendthrifts
to
devise
ways
and
means
for
profligacy
you
forget
the
item
which
restrains
you
from
taking
anybody
into
your
confidence
concerning
this
matter
think
it
over
it
may
not
be
so
difficult
after
a
night
sleep
if
it
is
too
difficult
to
get
the
night
sleep
all
the
rest
of
the
day
brewster
wandered
about
as
one
in
a
dream
he
was
and
puzzled
and
more
than
one
of
his
old
associates
receiving
a
distant
nod
in
passing
resentfully
concluded
that
his
wealth
was
beginning
to
change
him
his
brain
was
so
full
of
statistics
figures
and
computations
that
it
whirled
dizzily
and
once
he
narrowly
escaped
being
run
down
by
a
cable
car
he
dined
alone
at
a
small
french
restaurant
in
one
of
the
side
streets
the
waiter
marveled
at
the
amount
of
black
coffee
the
young
man
consumed
and
looked
hurt
when
he
did
not
touch
the
quail
and
lettuce
that
night
the
little
table
in
his
room
at
gray
was
littered
with
scraps
of
pad
paper
each
covered
with
an
incomprehensible
maze
of
figures
after
dinner
he
had
gone
to
his
own
rooms
forgetting
that
he
lived
on
fifth
avenue
until
long
after
midnight
he
smoked
and
calculated
and
dreamed
for
the
first
time
the
immensity
of
that
million
thrust
itself
upon
him
if
on
that
very
day
october
the
first
he
were
to
begin
the
task
of
spending
it
he
would
have
but
three
hundred
and
days
in
which
to
accomplish
the
end
taking
the
round
sum
of
one
million
dollars
as
a
basis
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
calculate
his
average
daily
disbursement
the
situation
did
not
look
so
utterly
impossible
until
he
held
up
the
little
sheet
of
paper
and
ruefully
contemplated
the
result
of
that
simple
problem
in
mathematics
it
meant
an
average
daily
expenditure
of
for
nearly
a
year
and
even
then
there
would
be
sixteen
cents
left
over
for
in
proving
the
result
of
his
rough
sum
in
division
he
could
account
for
but
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
money
would
be
drawing
interest
at
the
bank
but
for
each
day
i
am
getting
seven
times
as
much
he
soliloquized
as
he
finally
got
into
bed
that
means
a
day
a
clear
profit
of
that
pretty
good
yes
too
good
i
wonder
if
the
bank
could
oblige
me
by
not
charging
interest
the
figures
kept
adding
and
subtracting
themselves
as
he
dozed
off
and
once
during
the
night
he
dreamed
that
swearengen
jones
had
sentenced
him
to
eat
a
million
dollars
worth
of
game
and
salad
at
the
french
restaurant
he
awoke
with
the
consciousness
that
he
had
cried
aloud
i
can
do
it
but
a
year
is
not
very
long
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
it
was
nine
when
brewster
finally
rose
and
after
his
tub
he
felt
ready
to
cope
with
any
problem
even
a
substantial
breakfast
a
message
had
come
to
him
from
grant
of
grant
ripley
announcing
the
receipt
of
important
dispatches
from
montana
and
asking
him
to
luncheon
at
one
he
had
time
to
spare
and
as
margaret
and
gray
had
gone
out
he
telephoned
ellis
to
take
his
horse
to
the
entrance
to
the
park
at
once
the
crisp
autumn
air
was
perfect
for
his
ride
and
brewster
found
a
number
of
smart
people
already
riding
and
driving
in
the
park
his
horse
was
keen
for
a
canter
and
he
had
reached
the
obelisk
before
he
drew
rein
as
he
was
about
to
cross
the
carriage
road
he
was
nearly
run
down
by
miss
drew
in
her
new
french
automobile
i
beg
your
pardon
she
cried
you
the
third
person
i
run
into
so
you
see
i
not
discriminating
against
you
i
should
be
flattered
even
to
be
run
down
by
you
very
well
then
look
out
and
she
started
the
machine
as
if
to
charge
him
she
stopped
in
time
and
said
with
a
laugh
your
gallantry
deserves
a
reward
would
you
rather
send
your
horse
home
and
come
for
a
ride
with
me
my
man
is
waiting
at
street
if
you
come
that
far
go
with
pleasure
monty
had
merely
a
society
acquaintance
with
miss
drew
he
had
met
her
at
dinners
and
dances
as
he
had
a
host
of
other
girls
but
she
had
impressed
him
more
than
the
others
something
indescribable
took
place
every
time
their
eyes
met
monty
had
often
wondered
just
what
that
something
meant
but
he
had
always
realized
that
it
had
in
it
nothing
of
platonic
affection
if
i
did
have
to
meet
her
eyes
he
had
said
to
himself
i
could
go
on
discussing
even
politics
with
her
but
the
moment
she
looks
at
me
i
know
she
can
see
what
i
thinking
about
from
the
first
they
considered
themselves
very
good
friends
and
after
their
third
meeting
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
that
they
should
call
one
another
by
their
first
names
monty
knew
he
was
treading
on
dangerous
ground
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
what
barbara
might
think
of
him
he
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
she
must
feel
more
than
friendly
toward
him
as
they
rode
through
the
maze
of
carriages
they
bowed
frequently
to
friends
as
they
passed
they
were
conscious
that
some
of
the
women
noticeably
old
miss
dexter
actually
turned
around
and
gazed
at
them
are
you
afraid
people
will
talk
about
us
asked
monty
with
a
laugh
talk
about
our
riding
together
in
the
park
it
just
as
safe
here
as
it
would
be
in
fifth
avenue
besides
who
cares
i
fancy
we
can
stand
it
you
a
thoroughbred
barbara
i
simply
did
want
you
talked
about
when
i
go
too
far
say
the
word
and
drop
me
i
have
a
luncheon
at
two
but
until
then
we
have
our
ride
monty
gasped
and
looked
at
his
watch
five
minutes
to
one
he
cried
the
matter
of
his
engagement
with
the
attorney
had
quite
escaped
him
in
the
exhilaration
of
miss
drew
companionship
he
had
forgotten
even
uncle
james
millions
i
got
a
date
at
one
that
means
life
and
death
to
me
would
you
mind
taking
me
down
to
the
nearest
elevated
or
here
let
me
run
it
almost
before
barbara
was
aware
of
what
was
happening
they
had
changed
places
and
the
machine
under
monty
guidance
was
tearing
over
the
ground
of
all
the
casual
people
said
the
girl
by
no
means
unequal
to
the
excitement
i
believe
you
kidnapping
me
but
when
she
saw
the
grim
look
on
monty
face
and
one
policeman
after
another
warned
him
she
became
seriously
alarmed
monty
brewster
this
pace
is
positively
dangerous
perhaps
it
is
he
responded
but
if
they
have
sense
enough
to
keep
out
of
the
way
they
should
kick
if
they
get
run
over
i
do
mean
the
people
or
the
automobiles
or
traps
or
trees
or
monuments
monty
i
mean
you
and
me
i
know
we
either
be
killed
or

besides

one
now
lord
i
did
dream
it
was
so
late

your

so
important
she
asked
hanging
on
well
i
should
say
it
is
and
look
out
you
blooming
idiot
do
you
want
to
get
killed
the
last
remark
was
hurled
back
at
an
indignant
pedestrian
who
had
escaped
destruction
by
the
merest
chance
here
we
are
he
said
as
they
drew
up
beside
the
entrance
to
the
elevated
thanks
awfully
you
a
corker
sorry
to
leave
you
this
way
i
tell
you
all
about
it
later
you
a
dear
to
help
me
keep
my
appointment
seems
to
me
you
helped
yourself
she
cried
after
him
as
he
darted
up
the
steps
come
up
for
tea
some
day
and
tell
me
who
the
lady
is
after
he
had
gone
miss
drew
turned
to
her
chauffeur
who
was
in
the
tonneau
then
she
laughed
unrestrainedly
and
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
grin
stole
over
the
man
face
beg
pardon
miss
he
said
but
i
back
brewster
against
fournier
any
day
only
half
an
hour
late
brewster
entered
the
office
of
grant
ripley
flushed
eager
and
unconscious
of
the
big
splotch
of
mud
that
decorated
his
cheek
awfully
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
he
apologized
sherlock
holmes
would
say
that
you
had
been
driving
brewster
said
ripley
shaking
the
young
man
hand
he
would
miss
it
ripley
i
been
flying
what
have
you
heard
from
montana
he
could
no
longer
check
the
impatient
question
which
came
out
so
suddenly
that
the
attorneys
laughed
irresistibly
brewster
joining
them
an
instant
later
they
laid
before
him
a
half
dozen
telegrams
responses
from
bankers
lawyers
and
in
montana
these
messages
established
beyond
doubt
the
extent
of
james
sedgwick
wealth
it
was
reported
to
be
even
greater
than
shown
by
the
actual
figures
and
what
does
jones
say
demanded
montgomery
his
reply
resembles
a
press
dispatch
he
has
tried
to
make
himself
thoroughly
clear
and
if
there
is
anything
left
unsaid
it
is
past
our
comprehension
i
am
sorry
to
inform
you
though
that
he
has
paid
the
telegraph
charges
said
grant
smiling
broadly
is
he
rational
about
it
asked
montgomery
nervously
grant
gave
his
partner
a
quick
significant
glance
and
then
drew
from
his
desk
the
voluminous
telegram
from
swearengen
jones
it
was
as
follows
october

building
new
york
i
am
to
be
sole
referee
in
this
matter
you
are
retained
as
my
agents
heir
to
report
to
me
through
you
weekly
one
desire
of
uncle
was
to
forestall
grandfather
bequest
i
shall
respect
that
desire
enforce
terms
rigidly
he
was
my
best
friend
and
trusted
me
with
disposition
of
all
this
money
shall
attend
to
it
sacredly
heir
must
get
rid
of
money
left
to
him
in
given
time
out
of
respect
to
memory
of
uncle
he
must
take
no
one
into
his
confidence
do
want
world
to
think
was
damned
fool
he
was
here
are
rules
i
want
him
to
work
under
no
reckless
gambling
no
idiotic
board
of
trade
speculation
no
endowments
to
institutions
of
any
character
because
their
memory
would
be
an
invisible
asset
no
indiscriminate
giving
away
of
funds
by
that
i
do
mean
him
to
be
stingy
i
hate
a
stingy
man
and
so
did
no
more
than
ordinary
dissipation
i
hate
a
saint
so
did
and
both
of
us
sowed
an
oat
or
two
no
excessive
donations
to
charity
if
he
gives
as
other
millionaires
do
i
let
it
go
at
that
do
believe
charity
should
be
spoiled
by
indulgence
it
is
not
easy
to
spend
a
million
and
i
wo
be
unreasonable
with
him
let
him
spend
it
freely
but
not
foolishly
and
get
his
money
worth
out
of
it
if
he
does
that
i
consider
him
a
good
business
man
i
regard
it
foolish
to
tip
waiter
more
than
a
dollar
and
car
porter
does
not
deserve
over
five
he
does
not
earn
more
than
one
if
heir
wants
to
try
for
the
big
stake
he
better
begin
quick
because
he
might
slip
up
if
he
waits
until
day
of
judgment
it
less
than
year
off
luck
to
him
will
write
you
more
fully
jones
write
more
fully
echoed
montgomery
what
can
there
be
left
to
write
about
he
is
explicit
said
the
attorney
but
it
is
best
to
know
all
the
conditions
before
you
decide
have
you
made
up
your
mind
brewster
sat
for
a
long
time
staring
hard
at
the
floor
a
great
struggle
was
going
on
in
his
mind
it
a
gamble
and
a
big
one
he
said
at
last
squaring
his
shoulders
but
i
take
it
i
do
want
to
appear
disloyal
to
my
grandfather
but
i
think
that
even
he
would
advise
me
to
accept
yes
you
may
write
jones
that
i
accept
the
chance
the
attorneys
complimented
him
on
his
nerve
and
wished
him
success
brewster
turned
with
a
smile
i
begin
by
asking
what
you
think
a
reasonable
fee
for
an
attorney
in
a
case
of
this
kind
i
hope
you
will
act
for
me
you
do
want
to
spend
it
all
in
a
lump
do
you
asked
grant
smiling
we
can
hardly
act
as
counsel
for
both
you
and
mr
jones
but
i
must
have
a
lawyer
and
the
will
limits
the
number
of
my
confidants
what
am
i
to
do
we
will
consult
jones
in
regard
to
the
question
it
is
not
regular
you
see
but
i
apprehend
no
legal
difficulties
we
can
not
accept
fees
from
both
sides
however
said
grant
but
i
want
attorneys
who
are
willing
to
help
me
it
wo
be
a
help
if
you
decline
to
accept
my
money
we
resort
to
arbitration
laughed
ripley
before
night
montgomery
brewster
began
a
career
that
would
have
startled
the
world
had
the
facts
been
known
with
true
loyalty
to
the
little
sons
of
the
rich
he
asked
his
friends
to
dinner
and
opened
their
eyes
champagne
cried
harrison
as
they
were
seated
at
table
i
remember
the
last
time
i
had
champagne
naturally
laughed
subway
smith
you
could
remember
anything
after
that
as
the
dinner
progressed
brewster
explained
that
he
intended
to
double
his
fortune
within
a
year
i
going
to
have
some
fun
too
he
said
and
you

was
employed
as

as

there

chapter

monty
cristo
a
fortnight
later
montgomery
brewster
had
a
new
home
in
strict
obedience
to
his
chief
command
nopper
harrison
had
leased
until
the
september
following
one
of
the
most
expensive
apartments
to
be
found
in
new
york
city
the
rental
was
and
the
shrewd
financial
representative
had
saved
for
his
employer
by
paying
the
sum
in
advance
but
when
he
reported
this
bit
of
economy
to
brewster
he
was
surprised
that
it
brought
forth
a
frown
i
never
saw
a
man
who
had
less
sense
about
money
muttered
nopper
to
himself
why
he
spends
it
like
a
chicago
millionaire
trying
to
get
into
new
york
society
if
it
were
not
for
the
rest
of
us
he
be
a
pauper
in
six
months
paul
pettingill
to
his
own
intense
surprise
and
it
must
be
said
consternation
was
engaged
to
redecorate
certain
rooms
according
to
a
plan
suggested
by
the
tenant
the
rising
young
artist
in
a
great
flurry
of
excitement
agreed
to
do
the
work
for
and
then
blushed
like
a
schoolgirl
when
he
was
informed
by
the
practical
brewster
that
the
paints
and
material
for
one
room
alone
would
cost
twice
as
much
petty
you
have
no
more
idea
of
business
than
a
goat
criticised
montgomery
and
paul
lowered
his
head
in
humble
confession
that
man
who
calcimines
your
studio
could
figure
on
a
piece
of
work
with
more
intelligence
than
you
reveal
i
pay
it
only
a
fair
price
and
i
ca
afford
anything
cheap
in
this
place
at
this
rate
you
wo
be
able
to
afford
anything
said
pettingill
to
himself
and
so
it
was
that
pettingill
and
a
corps
of
decorators
soon
turned
the
rooms
into
a
confusion
of
scaffoldings
and
paint
buckets
out
of
which
in
the
end
emerged
something
very
distinguished
no
one
had
ever
thought
pettingill
deficient
in
ideas
and
this
was
his
opportunity
the
only
drawback
was
the
time
limit
which
brewster
so
remorselessly
fixed
without
that
he
felt
that
he
could
have
done
something
splendid
in
the
way
of
decorative
panels
something
that
would
make
even
the
glory
of
puvis
de
chavannes
turn
pallid
with
it
he
was
obliged
to
curb
his
turbulent
ideas
and
he
decided
that
a
rich
simplicity
was
the
proper
note
the
result
was
gorgeous
but
not
too
gorgeous
it
had
depth
and
distinction
elated
and
eager
he
assisted
brewster
in
selecting
furniture
and
hangings
for
each
room
but
he
did
not
know
that
his
employer
was
making
conditional
purchases
of
everything
brewster
had
agreements
with
all
the
dealers
to
the
effect
that
they
were
to
buy
everything
back
at
a
fair
price
if
he
desired
to
give
up
his
establishment
within
a
year
he
adhered
to
this
rule
in
all
cases
that
called
for
the
purchase
outright
of
substantial
necessities
the
bump
of
calculativeness
in
monty
brewster
head
was
growing
to
abnormal
proportions
in
retaining
his
rooms
at
gray
he
gave
the
flimsy
but
pathetic
excuse
that
he
wanted
a
place
in
which
he
might
find
occasional
seasons
of
peace
and
quiet
when
gray
protested
against
this
useless
bit
of
extravagance
his
grief
was
so
obviously
genuine
that
her
heart
was
touched
and
there
was
a
deep
fervent
joy
in
her
soul
she
loved
this
boy
and
tears
of
happiness
came
to
her
eyes
when
she
was
given
this
new
proof
of
his
loyalty
and
devotion
his
rooms
were
kept
for
him
just
as
if
he
had
expected
to
occupy
them
every
day
and
every
night
notwithstanding
the
luxurious
apartments
he
was
to
maintain
elsewhere
the
oliver
optic
books
still
lay
in
the
attic
all
tattered
and
torn
but
to
margaret
the
embodiment
of
prospective
riches
promises
of
sweet
hours
to
come
she
knew
monty
well
enough
to
feel
that
he
would
not
forget
the
dark
little
attic
of
old
for
all
the
splendors
that
might
come
with
the
new
dispensation
there
was
no
little
surprise
when
he
sent
out
invitations
for
a
large
dinner
his
grandfather
had
been
dead
less
than
a
month
and
society
was
somewhat
scandalized
by
the
plain
symptoms
of
disrespect
he
was
showing
no
one
had
expected
him
to
observe
a
prolonged
season
of
mourning
but
that
he
should
disregard
the
formalities
completely
was
rather
shocking
some
of
the
older
people
who
had
not
long
to
live
and
who
had
openly
denounced
his
heartlessness
it
was
not
very
gratifying
to
think
of
what
might
be
in
store
for
them
if
all
memories
were
as
short
as
brewster
old
ketchell
changed
her
will
and
two
nephews
were
cut
off
entirely
a
very
modest
and
impecunious
grandson
of
joseph
garrity
also
was
to
sustain
a
severe
change
of
fortune
in
the
near
future
if
the
cards
spoke
correctly
judge
van
woort
who
was
not
expected
to
live
through
the
night
got
better
immediately
after
hearing
some
one
in
the
whisper
that
montgomery
brewster
was
to
give
a
big
dinner
naturally
the
condemned
young
brewster
in
no
uncertain
terms
nevertheless
the
dinner
to
be
given
by
the
grandson
of
old
edwin
peter
brewster
was
the
talk
of
the
town
and
not
one
of
the
sixty
invited
guests
could
have
been
persuaded
to
miss
it
reports
as
to
its
magnificence
were
abroad
long
before
the
night
set
for
the
dinner
one
of
them
had
it
that
it
was
to
cost
a
plate
from
that
figure
the
legendary
price
receded
to
a
mark
as
low
as
montgomery
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
pay
or
more
but
some
mysterious
force
conveyed
to
his
mind
a
perfect
portrait
of
swearengen
jones
in
the
act
of
putting
down
a
large
black
mark
against
him
and
he
forbore
i
wish
i
knew
whether
i
had
to
abide
by
the
new
york
or
the
montana
standard
of
extravagance
brewster
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
he
ever
sees
the
new
york
papers
late
each
night
the
last
of
the
grand
old
brewster
family
went
to
his
bedroom
where
after
dismissing
his
man
he
settled
down
at
his
desk
with
a
pencil
and
a
pad
of
paper
lighting
the
candles
which
were
more
easily
managed
he
found
than
lamps
and
much
more
costly
he
thoughtfully
and
religiously
calculated
the
expenses
for
the
day
nopper
harrison
and
elon
gardner
had
the
receipts
for
all
moneys
spent
and
joe
bragdon
was
keeping
an
official
report
but
the
chief
as
they
called
him
could
not
go
to
sleep
until
he
was
satisfied
in
his
own
mind
that
he
was
keeping
up
the
average
for
the
first
two
weeks
it
had
been
easy
in
fact
he
seemed
to
have
quite
a
comfortable
lead
in
the
race
he
had
spent
almost
in
the
fortnight
but
he
realized
that
the
greater
part
of
it
had
gone
into
the
yearly
and
not
the
daily
he
kept
a
profit
and
loss
entry
in
his
little
private
ledger
but
it
was
not
like
any
other
account
of
the
kind
in
the
world
what
the
ordinary
merchant
would
have
charged
to
loss
he
jotted
down
on
the
profit
side
and
he
was
continually
looking
for
opportunities
to
swell
the
total
rawles
who
had
been
his
grandfather
butler
since
the
day
after
he
landed
in
new
york
came
over
to
the
grandson
establishment
greatly
to
the
wrath
and
confusion
of
the
latter
aunt
emmeline
the
chef
came
from
paris
and
his
name
was
detuit
ellis
the
footman
also
found
a
much
better
berth
with
monty
than
he
had
had
in
the
house
on
the
avenue
aunt
emmeline
never
forgave
her
nephew
for
these
base
and
disturbing
acts
of
treachery
as
she
called
them
one
of
monty
most
extraordinary
financial
feats
grew
out
of
the
purchase
of
a
automobile
he
blandly
admitted
to
nopper
harrison
and
the
two
secretaries
that
he
intended
to
use
it
to
practice
with
only
and
that
as
soon
as
he
learned
how
to
run
an
auto
as
it
should
be
run
he
expected
to
buy
a
good
sensible
durable
machine
for
his
staff
officers
frequently
put
their
heads
together
to
devise
ways
and
means
of
curbing
monty
reckless
extravagance
they
were
worried
he
like
a
sailor
in
port
protested
harrison
money
is
no
object
if
he
wants
a
thing
and
damn
it
he
seems
to
want
everything
he
sees
it
wo
last
long
gardner
said
reassuringly
like
his
namesake
monte
cristo
the
world
is
his
just
now
and
he
wants
to
enjoy
it
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
it
it
seems
to
me
whenever
they
reproached
brewster
about
the
matter
he
disarmed
them
by
saying
now
that
i
got
money
i
mean
to
give
my
friends
a
good
time
just
what
you
do
if
you
were
in
my
place
what
money
for
anyway
but
this
dinner
i
going
to
give
a
dozen
of
them
and
even
then
i
ca
pay
my
just
debts
for
years
i
been
entertained
at
people
houses
and
have
been
taken
cruising
on
their
yachts
they
have
always
been
bully
to
me
and
what
have
i
ever
done
for
them
nothing
now
that
i
can
afford
it
i
am
going
to
return
some
of
those
favors
and
square
myself
does
it
sound
reasonable
and
so
preparations
for
monty
dinner
went
on
in
addition
to
what
he
called
his
efficient
corps
of

he
had
secured
the
services
of

demille
as
social
mentor
and
utility
chaperon
demille
was
known
in
the
papers
as
the
leader
of
the
fast
younger
married
set
she
was
one
of
the
cleverest
and
young
women
in
town
and
her
husband
was
of
those
who
did
not
have
to
be
invited
too
demille
lived
at
the
club
and
visited
his
home
some
one
said
that
he
was
so
slow
and
his
wife
so
fast
that
when
she
invited
him
to
dinner
he
usually
was
two
or
three
days
late
altogether
demille
was
a
decided
acquisition
to
brewster
campaign
committee
it
required
just
her
touch
to
make
his
parties
fun
instead
of
funny
it
was
on
october
that
the
dinner
was
given
with
the
skill
of
a
general
dan
had
seated
the
guests
in
such
a
way
that
from
the
beginning
things
went
off
with
zest
colonel
drew
took
in
valentine
and
his
content
was
assured
van
winkle
and
the
beautiful
miss
valentine
were
side
by
side
and
no
one
could
say
he
looked
unhappy
cromwell
went
in
with
savage
and
the
same
delicate
tact
in
some
cases
it
was
almost
indelicate
was
displayed
in
the
disposition
of
other
guests
somehow
they
had
come
with
the
expectation
of
being
bored
curiosity
prompted
them
to
accept
but
it
did
not
prevent
the
subsequent
inevitable
lassitude
socially
monty
brewster
had
yet
to
make
himself
felt
he
and
his
dinners
were
something
to
talk
about
but
they
were
accepted
hesitatingly
haltingly
people
wondered
how
he
had
secured
the
cooperation
of
dan
but
then
dan
always
did
go
in
for
a
new
toy
to
her
was
inevitably
attributed
whatever
success
the
dinner
achieved
and
it
was
no
small
measure
yet
there
was
nothing
startling
about
the
affair
monty
had
decided
to
begin
conservatively
he
did
the
conventional
thing
but
he
did
it
well
he
added
a
touch
or
two
of
luxury
the
faintest
aroma
of
splendor
pettingill
had
designed
the
curiously
wayward
table
with
its
comfortable
atmosphere
of
companionship
and
arranged
its
decoration
of
great
lavender
orchids
and
lacy
butterfly
festoons
of
white
ones
touched
with
yellow
he
had
wanted
to
use
dahlias
in
their
many
rich
shades
from
pale
yellow
to
orange
and
deep
red
but
monty
held
out
for
orchids
it
was
the
artist
too
who
had
found
in
a
rare
and
happy
moment
the
massive
gold
candelabra
ancient
things
of
a
more
luxurious
age
and
their
opalescent
shades
against
his
advice
the
service
too
was
of
gold
rank
vulgarity
he
called
it
with
its
rich
meaningless
ornamentation
but
here
monty
was
obdurate
he
insisted
that
he
liked
the
color
and
that
porcelain
had
no
character
dan
only
prevented
a
quarrel
by
suggesting
that
several
courses
should
be
served
upon
sevres
pettingill
scheme
for
lighting
the
room
was
particularly
happy
for
the
benefit
of
his
walls
and
the
four
lovely
monets
which
monty
had
purchased
at
his
instigation
he
had
designed
a
ceiling
screen
of
heavy
rich
glass
in
tones
of
white
that
grew
into
yellow
and
dull
green
it
served
to
conceal
the
lights
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
the
glare
of
electricity
was
immensely
softened
and
made
harmonious
by
passing
through
it
it
gave
a
note
of
quiet
to
the
picture
which
caused
even
these
men
and
women
who
had
been
here
and
there
and
seen
many
things
to
draw
in
their
breath
sharply
altogether
the
effect
manifestly
made
an
impression
such
an
environment
had
its
influence
upon
the
company
it
went
far
toward
making
the
dinner
a
success
from
far
in
the
distance
came
the
softened
strains
of
hungarian
music
and
never
had
the
little
band
played
the
valse
amoureuse
and
the
valse
bleue
with
the
spirit
it
put
into
them
that
night
yet
the
soft
clamor
in
the
insistently
ignored
the
emotion
of
the
music
monty
bored
as
he
was
between
the
two
most
important
dowagers
at
the
feast
wondered
dimly
what
invisible
part
it
played
in
making
things
go
he
had
a
vagrant
fancy
that
without
it
there
would
have
been
no
zest
for
talk
no
noisy
competition
to
overcome
no
hurdles
to
leap
as
it
was
the
talk
certainly
went
well
and
dan
inspected
the
result
of
her
work
from
time
to
time
with
smiling
satisfaction
from
across
the
table
she
heard
colonel
drew
voice
brewster
evidently
objects
to
a
long
siege
he
is
planning
to
carry
us
by
assault
dan
turned
to
subway
smith
who
was
at
her
right
the
latest
addition
to
her
menagerie
what
is
this
friend
of
yours
she
asked
i
have
never
seen
such
complex
simplicity
this
new
plaything
has
no
real
charm
for
him
he
is
breaking
it
to
find
out
what
it
is
made
of
and
something
will
happen
when
he
discovers
the
sawdust
oh
do
worry
about
him
said
subway
easily
monty
at
least
a
good
sportsman
he
wo
complain
whatever
happens
he
accept
the
reckoning
and
pay
the
piper
it
was
only
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
that
monty
found
his
reward
in
a
moment
with
barbara
drew
he
stood
before
her
squaring
his
shoulders
belligerently
to
keep
away
intruders
and
she
smiled
up
at
him
in
that
bewildering
fashion
of
hers
but
it
was
only
for
an
instant
and
then
came
a
terrifying
din
from
the
followed
by
the
clamor
of
crashing
glass
the
guests
tried
for
a
moment
to
be
courteously
oblivious
but
the
noise
was
so
startling
that
such
politeness
became
farcical
the
host
with
a
little
laugh
went
down
the
hall
it
was
the
beautiful
screen
near
the
ceiling
that
had
fallen
a
thousand
pieces
of
shattered
glass
covered
the
place
the
table
was
a
sickening
heap
of
crushed
orchids
and
sputtering
candles
frightened
servants
rushed
into
the
room
from
one
side
just
as
brewster
entered
from
the
other
stupefaction
halted
them
after
the
first
pulseless
moment
of
horror
exclamations
of
dismay
went
up
on
all
sides
for
monty
brewster
the
first
sensation
of
regret
was
followed
by
a
diabolical
sense
of
joy
thank
the
lord
he
said
softly
in
the
hush
the
look
of
surprise
he
encountered
in
the
faces
of
his
guests
brought
him
up
with
a
jerk
that
it
did
happen
while
we
were
dining
he
added
with
serene
thankfulness
and
his
nonchalance
scored
for
him
in
the
idle
game
he
was
playing
chapter
vii
a
lesson
in
tact
brewster
butler
was
surprised
and
annoyed
for
the
first
time
in
his
official
career
he
had
unbent
so
far
as
to
manifest
a
personal
interest
in
the
welfare
of
his
master
he
was
on
the
verge
of
assuming
a
responsibility
which
makes
any
servant
intolerable
but
after
his
interview
he
resolved
that
he
would
never
again
overstep
his
position
he
made
sure
that
it
should
be
the
last
offense
the
day
following
the
dinner
rawles
appeared
before
young
brewster
and
indicated
by
his
manner
that
the
call
was
an
important
one
brewster
was
seated
at
his
deep
in
thought
the
exclamation
that
followed
cough
of
announcement
was
so
sharp
and
so
unmistakably
fierce
that
all
other
evidence
paled
into
insignificance
the
butler
interruption
came
at
a
moment
when
monty
mental
arithmetic
was
pulling
itself
out
of
a
very
bad
rut
and
the
cough
drove
it
back
into
chaos
what
is
it
he
demanded
irritably
rawles
had
upset
his
calculations
to
the
extent
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
dollars
i
came
to
report
unfortunate
condition
the
servants
sir
said
rawies
stiffening
as
his
responsibility
became
more
and
more
weighty
he
had
relaxed
temporarily
upon
entering
the
room
what
the
trouble
the
trouble
sir
then
why
bother
me
about
it
i
thought
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
know
sir
the
servants
was
going
to
ask
for
wiges
sir
you
say
they
were
going
to
ask
are
they
and
monty
eyes
lighted
up
at
the
thought
of
new
possibilities
i
convinced
them
sir
as
how
they
were
getting
good
pay
as
it
is
sir
and
that
they
ought
to
be
satisfied
they
be
a
long
time
finding
a
better
place
and
as
good
wiges
they
been
with
you
a
week
and
here
they
are
strikin
for
more
pay
really
sir
these
american
servants
rawles
that
do
exploded
monty
the
butler
chin
went
up
and
his
cheeks
grew
redder
than
ever
i
beg
pardon
sir
he
gasped
with
a
respectful
but
injured
air
rawles
you
will
kindly
not
interfere
in
such
matters
again
it
is
not
only
the
privilege
but
the
duty
of
every
american
to
strike
for
higher
pay
whenever
he
feels
like
it
and
i
want
it
distinctly
understood
that
i
am
heartily
in
favor
of
their
attitude
you
will
kindly
go
back
and
tell
them
that
after
a
reasonable
length
of
service
their
wiges
i
mean
wages
shall
be
increased
and
do
meddle
again
rawles
late
that
afternoon
brewster
dropped
in
at
demille
to
talk
over
plans
for
the
next
dinner
he
realized
that
in
no
other
way
could
he
squander
his
money
with
a
better
chance
of
getting
its
worth
than
by
throwing
himself
bodily
into
society
it
went
easily
and
there
could
be
only
one
asset
arising
from
it
in
the
end
his
own
sense
of
disgust
so
glad
to
see
you
monty
greeted
dan
glowingly
coming
in
with
a
rush
come
upstairs
and
i
give
you
some
tea
and
a
cigarette
i
not
at
home
to
anybody
that
very
good
of
you
dan
said
he
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
i
do
know
what
i
do
without
your
help
he
was
thinking
how
pretty
she
was
you
be
richer
at
any
rate
turning
to
smile
upon
him
from
the
upper
landing
i
was
in
tears
half
the
night
monty
over
that
glass
screen
she
said
after
finding
a
comfortable
place
among
the
cushions
of
a
divan
brewster
dropped
into
a
roomy
lazy
chair
in
front
of
her
and
handed
her
a
cigarette
as
he
responded
carelessly
it
amounted
to
nothing
of
course
it
was
very
annoying
that
it
should
happen
while
the
guests
were
still
there
then
he
added
gravely
in
strict
confidence
i
had
planned
to
have
it
fall
just
as
we
were
pushing
back
our
chairs
but
the
confounded
thing
disappointed
me
that
the
trouble
with
these
automatic
climaxes
they
usually
hang
fire
it
was
to
have
been
a
sort
of
fall
of
babylon
effect
you
know
splendid
but
like
babylon
it
fell
at
the
wrong
time
for
a
lively
quarter
of
an
hour
they
discussed
people
about
town
liberally
approving
the
slandered
and
denouncing
the
slanderers
a
still
busier
quarter
of
an
hour
ensued
when
together
they
made
up
the
list
of
dinner
guests
he
moved
a
little
up
to
the
divan
and
she
looked
on
eagerly
while
he
wrote
down
the
names
she
suggested
after
many
puckerings
of
her
fair
aristocratic
brow
and
then
drew
lines
through
them
when
she
changed
her
mind
demille
handled
her
people
without
gloves
in
making
up
monty
lists
the
dinners
were
not
hers
and
she
could
afford
to
do
as
she
pleased
with
his
he
was
broad
and
tall
and
she
was
not
slow
to
see
that
he
was
indifferent
he
did
not
care
who
the
guests
were
or
how
they
came
he
merely
wished
to
make
sure
of
their
presence
his
only
blunder
was
the
rather
diffident
recommendation
that
barbara
drew
be
asked
again
if
he
observed
that
dan
head
sank
a
little
closer
to
the
paper
he
attached
no
importance
to
the
movement
he
could
not
see
that
her
eyes
grew
narrow
and
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
little
catch
in
her
breath
would
that
be
a
little
just
a
little
pronounced
she
asked
lightly
enough
you
mean
that
people
might
talk
she
might
feel
conspicuously
present
do
you
think
so
we
are
such
good
friends
you
know
of
course
if
you
like
to
have
her
slowly
and
doubtfully
why
put
her
name
down
but
you
evidently
have
seen
that
dan
pointed
to
a
copy
of
the
trumpet
which
lay
on
the
table
when
he
had
handed
her
the
paper
she
said
censor
is
growing
facetious
at
your
expense
i
am
getting
on
in
society
with
a
vengeance
if
that
ass
starts
in
to
write
about
me
listen
to
this
she
had
pointed
out
to
him
the
obnoxious
paragraph
if
brewster
drew
a
diamond
flush
do
you
suppose
he
catch
the
queen
and
if
he
caught
her
how
long
do
you
think
remain
drew
or
if
she
drew
brewster
would
she
be
willing
to
learn
such
a
game
as
monte
the
next
morning
a
writer
who
signed
himself
the
censor
got
a
thrashing
and
one
montgomery
brewster
had
his
name
in
the
papers
surrounded
by
fulsome
words
of
praise
chapter
viii
the
forelock
of
time
one
morning
not
long
after
the
incidents
just
related
brewster
lay
in
bed
staring
at
the
ceiling
deep
in
thought
there
was
a
worried
pucker
on
his
forehead
by
the
rumpled
hair
and
his
eyes
were
wide
and
sleepless
he
had
dined
at
the
drews
the
evening
before
and
had
had
an
awakening
as
he
thought
of
the
matter
he
could
recall
no
special
occurrence
that
he
could
really
use
as
evidence
colonel
and
drew
had
been
as
kind
as
ever
and
barbara
could
not
have
been
more
charming
but
something
had
gone
wrong
and
he
had
endured
a
wretched
evening
that
little
english
johnnie
was
to
blame
he
argued
of
course
barbara
had
a
right
to
put
any
one
she
liked
next
to
her
but
why
she
should
have
chosen
that
silly
ass
is
more
than
i
know
by
jove
if
i
had
been
on
the
other
side
i
warrant
his
grace
would
have
been
lost
in
the
dust
his
brain
was
whirling
and
for
the
first
time
he
was
beginning
to
feel
the
unpleasant
pangs
of
jealousy
the
duke
of
beauchamp
he
especially
disliked
although
the
poor
man
had
hardly
spoken
during
the
dinner
but
monty
could
not
be
reconciled
he
knew
of
course
that
barbara
had
suitors
by
the
dozen
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
even
seriously
considered
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
his
encounter
with
the
censor
had
brought
her
into
undesirable
notice
she
forgave
him
everything
after
a
moment
consideration
the
first
few
wrenches
of
resentment
were
overbalanced
by
her
american
appreciation
of
chivalry
however
inspired
the
censor
had
gone
for
years
unpunished
his
coarse
wit
being
aimed
at
every
one
who
had
come
into
social
prominence
so
pungent
and
vindictive
was
his
pen
that
other
men
feared
him
and
there
were
many
who
lived
in
glass
houses
in
terror
of
a
fusilade
brewster
prompt
and
sufficient
action
had
checked
the
pernicious
attacks
and
he
became
a
hero
among
men
and
women
after
that
night
there
was
no
point
to
the
censor
pen
monty
first
qualms
of
apprehension
were
swept
away
when
colonel
drew
himself
hailed
him
the
morning
after
the
encounter
and
in
no
unmeasured
terms
congratulated
him
upon
his
achievement
assuring
him
that
barbara
and
drew
approved
although
they
might
lecture
him
as
a
matter
of
form
but
on
this
morning
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
monty
was
thinking
deeply
and
painfully
he
was
confronted
by
a
most
embarrassing
condition
and
he
was
discussing
it
soberly
with
himself
i
never
told
her
he
said
to
himself
but
if
she
does
know
my
feeling
she
is
not
as
clever
as
i
think
besides
i
have
time
to
make
love
to
her
now
if
it
were
any
other
girl
i
suppose
i
have
to
but
babs
why
she
must
understand
and
yet
damn
that
duke
in
order
to
woo
her
properly
he
would
be
compelled
to
neglect
financial
duties
that
needed
every
particle
of
at
his
command
he
found
himself
opposed
at
the
outset
by
a
startling
embarrassment
made
absolutely
clear
by
the
computations
of
the
night
before
the
last
four
days
of
indifference
to
finance
on
one
side
and
pampering
the
heart
on
the
other
had
proved
very
costly
to
use
his
own
expression
he
had
been
set
back
almost
eight
thousand
dollars
an
average
like
that
would
be
ruinous
why
think
of
it
he
continued
for
each
day
sacrificed
to
barbara
i
must
deduct
something
like
hundred
dollars
a
long
campaign
would
put
me
irretrievably
in
the
hole
i
get
so
far
behind
that
a
holocaust
could
put
me
even
she
ca
expect
that
of
me
yet
girls
are
such
idiots
about
devotion
and
of
course
she
does
know
what
a
heavy
task
i
facing
and
there
are
the
others
what
will
they
do
while
i
am
out
of
the
running
i
can
not
go
to
her
and
say
may
i
have
a
year
vacation
i
come
back
next
september
on
the
other
hand
i
shall
surely
neglect
my
business
if
she
expects
me
to
compete
what
pleasure
shall
i
get
out
of
the
seven
millions
if
i
lose
her
i
ca
afford
to
take
chances
that
duke
wo
have
seven
millions
next
september
it
true
but
he
have
a
prodigious
argument
against
me
about
the
or
second
then
a
brilliant
thought
occurred
to
him
which
caused
him
to
ring
for
a
with
such
a
show
of
impatience
that
rawles
stood
aghast
the
telegram
which
monty
wrote
was
as
follows
swearengen
jones
butte
montana
may
i
marry
and
turn
all
property
over
to
wife
providing
she
will
have
me
montgomery
brewster
why
is
that
reasonable
he
asked
himself
after
the
boy
had
gone
making
property
over
to
one
wife
is
neither
a
loan
nor
is
it
charity
old
jones
might
call
it
needless
extravagance
since
he
a
bachelor
but
it
generally
done
because
it
good
business
monty
was
hopeful
following
his
habit
in
trouble
he
sought
margaret
gray
to
whom
he
could
always
appeal
for
advice
and
consolation
she
was
to
come
to
his
next
and
it
was
easy
to
lead
up
to
the
subject
in
hand
by
mentioning
the
other
guests
and
barbara
drew
he
concluded
after
naming
all
the
others
they
were
alone
in
the
library
and
she
was
drinking
in
the
details
of
the
dinner
as
he
related
them
was
she
at
your
first
dinner
she
asked
quickly
he
successfully
affected
mild
embarrassment
yes
she
must
be
very
attractive
there
was
no
venom
in
peggy
heart
she
is
attractive
in
fact
she
one
of
the
best
peggy
he
said
paving
the
way
it
too
bad
she
seems
to
care
for
that
little
duke
he
a
bounder
he
argued
well
do
take
it
to
heart
you
do
have
to
marry
him
and
peggy
laughed
but
i
do
take
it
to
heart
peggy
said
monty
seriously
i
pretty
hard
hit
and
i
want
your
help
a
sister
advice
is
always
the
best
in
a
matter
of
this
sort
she
looked
into
his
eyes
dully
for
an
instant
not
realizing
the
full
importance
of
his
confession
you
monty
she
said
incredulously
i
got
it
bad
peggy
he
replied
staring
hard
at
the
floor
she
could
not
understand
the
cold
gray
tone
that
suddenly
enveloped
the
room
the
strange
sense
of
loneliness
that
came
over
her
was
inexplicable
the
little
something
that
rose
in
her
throat
would
not
be
dislodged
nor
could
she
throw
off
the
weight
that
seemed
pressing
down
upon
her
he
saw
the
odd
look
in
her
eyes
and
the
drawn
uncertain
smile
on
her
lips
but
he
attributed
them
to
wonder
and
incredulity
somehow
after
all
these
years
he
was
transformed
before
her
very
eyes
she
was
looking
upon
a
new
personality
he
was
no
longer
montgomery
the
brother
but
she
could
not
explain
how
and
when
the
change
crept
over
her
what
did
it
all
mean
i
am
very
glad
if
it
will
make
you
happy
monty
she
said
slowly
the
gray
in
her
lips
giving
way
to
red
once
more
does
she
know
i
have
told
her
in
so
many
words
peggy
but
but
i
going
to
this
evening
he
announced
lamely
this
evening
i
ca
wait
monty
said
as
he
rose
to
go
i
glad
you
pleased
peggy
i
need
your
good
wishes
and
peggy
he
continued
with
a
touch
of
boyish
wistfulness
do
you
think
there
a
chance
for
a
fellow
i
had
the
very
deuce
of
a
time
over
that
englishman
it
was
not
quite
easy
for
her
to
say
monty
you
are
the
best
in
the
world
go
in
and
win
from
the
window
she
watched
him
swing
off
down
the
street
wondering
if
he
would
turn
to
wave
his
hand
to
her
his
custom
for
years
but
the
broad
back
was
straight
and
uncompromising
his
long
strides
carried
him
swiftly
out
of
sight
but
it
was
many
minutes
before
she
turned
her
eyes
which
were
smarting
a
little
from
the
point
where
he
was
lost
in
the
crowd
the
room
looked
ashen
to
her
as
she
brought
her
mind
back
to
it
and
somehow
things
had
grown
difficult
when
montgomery
reached
home
he
found
this
telegram
from
jones
montgomery
brewster
new
york
city
stick
to
your
knitting
you
damned
fool
jones
chapter
ix
love
and
a
it
is
best
not
to
repeat
the
expressions
brewster
used
regarding
one
jones
after
reading
his
telegram
but
he
felt
considerably
relieved
after
he
had
uttered
them
he
fell
to
reading
accounts
of
the
big
which
was
to
take
place
in
san
francisco
that
evening
he
revelled
in
the
descriptions
of
upper
cuts
and
left
hooks
and
learned
incidentally
that
the
affair
was
to
be
quite
a
local
amateur
was
to
box
a
champion
quick
to
see
an
opportunity
and
cajoling
himself
into
the
belief
that
swearengen
jones
could
not
object
to
such
a
display
of
sportsmanship
brewster
made
harrison
book
several
good
wagers
on
the
result
he
intimated
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
favorite
would
lose
harrison
soon
placed
three
thousand
dollars
on
his
man
the
young
financier
felt
so
sure
of
the
result
that
he
entered
the
bets
on
the
profit
side
of
his
ledger
the
moment
he
received
harrison
report
this
done
he
telephoned
miss
drew
she
was
not
insensible
to
the
significance
of
his
inquiry
if
she
would
be
in
that
afternoon
she
had
observed
in
him
of
late
a
condition
of
uneasiness
supplemented
by
moroseness
and
occasional
periods
of
irascibility
every
girl
whose
occupation
in
life
is
the
study
of
men
recognizes
these
symptoms
and
knows
how
to
treat
them
barbara
had
dealt
with
many
men
afflicted
in
this
manner
and
the
flutter
of
anticipation
that
came
with
his
urgent
plea
to
see
her
was
tempered
by
experience
it
had
something
of
joy
in
it
for
she
cared
enough
for
montgomery
brewster
to
have
made
her
anxiously
uncertain
of
his
state
of
mind
she
cared
indeed
much
more
than
she
intended
to
confess
at
the
outset
it
was
nearly
five
when
he
came
and
for
once
the
philosophical
miss
drew
felt
a
little
irritation
so
certain
was
she
of
his
object
in
coming
that
his
tardiness
was
a
trifle
ruffling
he
apologized
for
being
late
and
succeeded
in
banishing
the
pique
that
possessed
her
it
was
naturally
impossible
for
him
to
share
all
his
secrets
with
her
that
is
why
he
did
not
tell
her
that
grant
ripley
had
called
him
up
to
report
the
receipt
of
a
telegram
from
swearengen
jones
in
which
the
gentleman
laconically
said
he
could
feed
the
whole
state
of
montana
for
less
than
six
thousand
dollars
beyond
that
there
was
no
comment
brewster
in
dire
trepidation
hastened
to
the
office
of
the
attorneys
they
smiled
when
he
burst
in
upon
them
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
does
the
miserly
old
hayseed
expect
me
to
spend
a
million
for
newspapers
cigarettes
and
boston
terriers
i
thought
he
would
be
reasonable
he
evidently
has
seen
the
newspaper
accounts
of
your
dinner
and
this
is
merely
his
comment
said
ripley
it
either
a
warning
or
else
he
ambiguous
in
his
compliments
growled
brewster
disgustedly
i
do
believe
he
disapproved
brewster

the
old

is
widely
known
as
a

then

two
minutes
later
the
following
telegram
to
swearengen

was
awaiting
the
arrival
of
a
and
brewster
was
blandly
assuring
grant
ripley
that
he
did
not
care
a
rap
for
the
consequences

just
before
leaving
his

for

this

jones
i
was
beginning
to
despair
monty
said
miss
drew
reproachfully
when
he
had
come
down
from
the
height
of
his
exasperation
and
remembered
that
there
were
things
of
more
importance
the
light
in
his
eyes
brought
the
faintest
tinge
of
red
to
her
cheeks
and
where
a
moment
before
there
had
been
annoyance
there
was
now
a
feeling
of
serenity
for
a
moment
the
silence
was
fraught
with
purpose
monty
glanced
around
the
room
uncertain
how
to
begin
it
was
not
so
easy
as
he
had
imagined
you
are
very
good
to
see
me
he
said
at
last
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
talk
to
you
this
evening
i
could
not
have
endured
the
suspense
any
longer
barbara
i
spent
three
or
four
sleepless
nights
on
your
account
will
it
spoil
your
evening
if
i
tell
you
in
plain
words
what
you
already
know
it
wo
bother
you
will
it
he
floundered
what
do
you
mean
monty
she
begged
purposely
dense
and
with
wonderful
control
of
her
eyes
i
love
you
babs
he
cried
i
thought
you
knew
about
it
all
along
or
i
should
have
told
you
before
that
why
i
have
slept
the
fear
that
you
may
not
care
for
me
has
driven
me
nearly
to
distraction
it
could
go
on
any
longer
i
must
know
there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eyes
that
made
her
pose
of
indifference
difficult
the
fervor
of
his
words
took
possession
of
her
she
had
expected
sentiment
of
such
a
different
character
that
his
frank
confession
disarmed
her
completely
beneath
his
ardent
abrupt
plea
there
was
assurance
the
confidence
of
one
who
is
not
to
be
denied
it
was
not
what
he
said
but
the
way
he
said
it
a
wave
of
exultation
swept
over
her
tingling
through
every
nerve
under
the
spell
her
resolution
to
dally
lightly
with
his
emotion
suffered
a
check
that
almost
brought
ignominious
surrender
both
of
her
hands
were
clasped
in
his
when
he
exultingly
resumed
the
charge
against
her
heart
but
she
was
rapidly
regaining
control
of
her
emotions
and
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
losing
ground
with
each
step
he
took
forward
barbara
drew
loved
brewster
but
she
was
going
to
make
him
pay
dearly
for
the
brief
lapse
her
composure
had
experienced
when
next
she
spoke
she
was
again
the
miss
drew
who
had
been
trained
in
the
ways
of
the
world
and
not
the
young
girl
in
love
i
care
for
you
a
great
deal
monty
she
said
but
i
wondering
whether
i
care
enough
to
to
marry
you
we
have
known
each
other
very
long
babs
he
said
tenderly
but
i
think
we
know
each
other
well
enough
to
be
beyond
wondering
it
is
like
you
to
manage
the
whole
thing
she
said
chidingly
you
give
me
time
to
convince
myself
that
i
love
you
as
you
would
like
and
as
i
must
love
if
i
expect
to
be
happy
with
the
man
i
marry
i
forgot
myself
he
said
humbly
you
forgot
me
she
protested
gently
touched
by
this
sign
of
contrition
i
do
care
for
you
monty
but
do
you
see
it
no
little
thing
you
ask
of
me
i
must
be
sure
very
sure
before
i
before
do
be
so
distressed
he
pleaded
you
will
love
me
i
know
because
you
love
me
now
this
means
much
to
me
but
it
means
more
to
you
you
are
the
woman
and
you
are
the
one
whose
happiness
should
be
considered
i
can
live
only
in
the
hope
that
when
i
come
to
you
again
with
this
same
story
and
this
same
question
you
not
be
afraid
to
trust
yourself
to
me
you
deserve
to
be
happy
for
that
monty
she
said
earnestly
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
kept
her
eyes
from
wavering
as
they
looked
into
his
you
will
let
me
try
to
make
you
love
me
he
asked
eagerly
i
may
not
be
worth
the
struggle
i
take
that
chance
he
replied
she
was
conscious
of
disappointment
after
he
was
gone
he
had
not
pleaded
as
ardently
as
she
had
expected
and
desired
and
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
banish
the
touch
of
irritation
that
had
come
to
haunt
her
for
the
night
brewster
walked
to
the
club
elated
that
he
had
at
least
made
a
beginning
his
position
was
now
clear
besides
losing
a
fortune
he
must
win
barbara
in
open
competition
at
the
theater
that
evening
he
met
harrison
who
was
in
a
state
of
jubilation
where
did
you
get
that
tip
asked
he
tip
what
tip
from
brewster
on
the
brewster
face
fell
and
something
cold
crept
over
him
how
did
what
was
the
result
he
asked
sure
of
the
answer
have
you
heard
your
man
knocked
him
out
in
the
fifth
round

chapter
x
napoleon
of
finance
the
next
two
months
were
busy
ones
for
brewster
miss
drew
saw
him
quite
as
often
as
before
the
important
interview
but
he
was
always
a
puzzle
to
her
his
attitude
is
changed
somehow
she
thought
to
herself
and
then
she
remembered
that
a
man
who
wins
a
girl
after
an
ardent
suit
is
often
like
one
who
runs
after
a
street
car
and
then
sits
down
to
read
his
paper
in
truth
after
the
first
few
days
monty
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
competitors
and
was
resting
in
the
consciousness
of
his
assured
position
each
day
he
sent
her
flowers
and
considered
that
he
had
more
than
done
his
duty
he
used
no
small
part
of
his
income
on
the
flowers
but
in
this
case
his
mission
was
almost
forgotten
in
his
love
for
barbara
monty
attitude
was
not
due
to
any
wanting
of
his
affection
but
to
the
very
unromantic
business
in
which
he
was
engaged
it
seemed
to
him
that
plan
as
he
might
he
could
not
devise
fresh
ways
and
means
to
earn
a
day
he
was
still
comfortably
ahead
in
the
race
but
a
famine
in
opportunities
was
not
far
remote
ten
big
dinner
parties
and
a
string
of
elaborate
suppers
maintained
a
fair
but
insufficient
average
and
he
could
see
that
the
time
was
ripe
for
radical
measures
he
could
not
go
on
forever
with
his
dinners
people
were
already
beginning
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
he
was
warming
his
toes
on
the
social
register
and
he
had
no
desire
to
become
the
laughing
stock
of
the
town
the
few
slighting
sarcastic
remarks
about
his
business
ability
chiefly
by
women
and
therefore
reflected
from
the
men
hurt
him
miss
drew
apparently
harmless
taunt
and
open
criticism
told
plainly
enough
how
the
wind
was
blowing
but
it
was
peggy
gentle
questions
that
cut
the
deepest
there
was
such
honest
concern
in
her
voice
that
he
could
see
how
his
profligacy
was
troubling
her
and
gray
in
their
eyes
more
than
in
the
others
he
felt
ashamed
and
humiliated
finally
goaded
by
the
remark
of
a
bank
director
which
he
overheard
edwin
brewster
is
turning
handsprings
in
his
grave
over
the
way
he
is
going
it
monty
resolved
to
redeem
himself
in
the
eyes
of
his
critics
he
would
show
them
that
his
brain
was
not
wholly
given
over
to
frivolity
with
this
project
in
mind
he
decided
to
cause
a
little
excitement
in
wall
street
for
some
days
he
stealthily
watched
the
stock
market
and
plied
his
friends
with
questions
about
values
constant
reading
and
observation
finally
convinced
him
that
lumber
and
fuel
common
was
the
one
stock
in
which
he
could
safely
plunge
casting
aside
all
apprehension
so
far
as
swearengen
jones
was
concerned
he
prepared
for
what
was
to
be
his
one
and
only
venture
on
the
stock
exchange
before
the
of
the
following
september
with
all
the
cunning
and
craftiness
of
a
general
he
laid
his
plans
for
the
attack
gardner
face
was
the
picture
of
despair
when
brewster
asked
him
to
buy
heavily
in
lumber
and
fuel
good
heavens
monty
cried
the
broker
you
joking
lumber
is
away
up
now
it
ca
possibly
go
a
fraction
of
a
point
higher
take
my
advice
and
do
touch
it
it
opened
at
and
closed
at
why
man
you
crazy
to
think
about
it
for
an
instant
i
know
my
business
gardner
said
brewster
quietly
and
his
conscience
smote
him
when
he
saw
the
flush
of
mortification
creep
into
the
face
of
his
friend
the
rebuke
had
cut
gardner
to
the
quick
but
monty
i
know
what
i
talking
about
at
least
let
me
tell
you
something
about
this
stock
pleaded
elon
loyally
despite
the
wound
gardy
i
gone
into
this
thing
carefully
and
if
ever
a
man
felt
sure
about
anything
i
do
about
this
said
monty
decidedly
but
affectionately
take
my
word
for
it
lumber
ca
go
any
higher
think
of
the
situation
the
lumber
men
in
the
north
and
west
are
overstocked
and
there
is
a
strike
ready
to
go
into
effect
when
that
comes
the
stock
will
go
for
a
song
the
slump
is
liable
to
begin
any
day
my
mind
is
made
up
said
the
other
firmly
and
gardner
was
in
despair
will
you
or
will
you
not
execute
an
order
for
me
at
the
opening
i
start
with
ten
thousand
shares
what
will
it
cost
me
to
margin
it
for
ten
points
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
exclusive
of
commission
which
would
be
twelve
and
a
half
a
hundred
shares
despite
the
most
strenuous
opposition
from
gardner
brewster
adhered
to
his
design
and
the
broker
executed
the
order
the
next
morning
he
knew
that
brewster
had
but
one
chance
to
win
and
that
was
to
buy
the
stock
in
a
lump
instead
of
distributing
it
among
several
brokers
and
throughout
the
session
this
was
a
point
that
monty
had
overlooked
there
had
been
little
to
excite
the
stock
exchange
for
some
weeks
nothing
was
active
and
the
slightest
flurry
was
hailed
as
an
event
every
one
knew
that
the
calm
would
be
disturbed
at
some
near
day
but
nobody
looked
for
a
sensation
in
lumber
and
fuel
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
a
slump
was
coming
and
there
was
scarcely
any
trading
in
the
stock
when
elon
gardner
acting
for
montgomery
brewster
took
ten
thousand
shares
at
there
was
a
mighty
gasp
on
the
exchange
then
a
rubbing
of
eyes
then
commotion
astonishment
was
followed
by
nervousness
and
then
came
the
struggle
brewster
confident
that
the
stock
could
go
no
higher
and
that
sooner
or
later
it
must
drop
calmly
ordered
his
horse
for
a
ride
in
the
park
even
though
he
knew
the
venture
was
to
be
a
failure
in
the
ordinary
sense
he
found
joy
in
the
knowledge
that
he
was
doing
something
he
might
be
a
fool
he
was
at
least
no
longer
inactive
the
feel
of
the
air
was
good
to
him
he
was
exhilarated
by
the
glitter
of
the
snow
the
answering
excitement
of
his
horse
the
gaiety
and
sparkle
of
life
about
him
somewhere
far
back
in
his
inner
self
there
seemed
to
be
the
sound
of
cheering
and
the
clapping
of
hands
shortly
before
noon
he
reached
his
club
where
he
was
to
lunch
with
colonel
drew
in
the
he
observed
that
men
were
looking
at
him
in
a
manner
less
casual
than
was
customary
some
of
them
went
so
far
as
to
smile
encouragingly
and
others
waved
their
hands
in
the
most
cordial
fashion
three
or
four
very
young
members
looked
upon
him
with
admiration
and
envy
and
even
the
porters
seemed
more
obsequious
there
was
something
strangely
oppressive
in
all
this
show
of
deference
colonel
drew
dignity
relaxed
amazingly
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
young
man
he
came
forward
to
meet
him
and
his
greeting
almost
carried
monty
off
his
feet
how
did
you
do
it
my
boy
cried
the
colonel
she
off
a
point
or
two
now
i
believe
but
half
an
hour
ago
she
was
booming
gad
i
never
heard
of
anything
more
spectacular
monty
heart
was
in
his
mouth
as
he
rushed
over
to
the
ticker
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
grasp
the
immensity
of
the
disaster
gardner
had
bought
in
at
and
that
very
action
seemed
to
put
new
life
into
the
stock
just
as
it
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
for
lack
of
support
along
came
this
sensational
order
for
ten
thousand
shares
and
there
could
be
but
one
result
at
one
time
in
the
morning
lumber
and
fuel
traded
in
by
excited
holders
touched
and
seemed
in
a
fair
way
to
hold
firm
around
that
figure
other
men
came
up
and
listened
eagerly
brewster
realized
that
his
dash
in
lumber
and
fuel
had
been
a
of
cleverness
when
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
these
men
but
a
catastrophe
from
his
own
i
hope
you
sold
it
when
it
was
at
the
top
said
the
colonel
anxiously
i
instructed
gardner
to
sell
only
when
i
gave
the
word
said
monty
lamely
several
of
the
men
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
disgust
well
if
i
were
you
i
tell
him
to
sell
remarked
the
colonel
coldly
the
effect
of
your
plunge
has
worn
off
brewster
and
the
other
side
will
drive
prices
down
they
wo
be
caught
napping
again
either
said
one
of
the
bystanders
earnestly
do
you
think
so
and
there
was
a
note
of
relief
in
monty
voice
from
all
sides
came
the
advice
to
sell
at
once
but
brewster
was
not
to
be
pushed
he
calmly
lighted
a
cigarette
and
with
an
assured
air
of
wisdom
told
them
to
wait
a
little
while
and
see
she
already
falling
off
said
some
one
at
the
ticker
when
brewster
bewildered
eyes
raced
over
the
figures
the
stock
was
quoted
at
his
sigh
of
relief
was
heard
but
misunderstood
he
might
be
saved
after
all
the
stock
had
started
to
go
down
and
there
seemed
no
reason
why
it
should
stop
as
he
intended
to
purchase
no
more
it
was
fair
to
assume
that
the
backbone
was
at
the
breaking
point
the
crash
was
bound
to
come
he
could
hardly
restrain
a
cry
of
joy
even
while
he
stood
at
the
ticker
the
little
instrument
began
to
tell
of
a
further
decline
as
the
price
went
down
his
hopes
went
up
the
bystanders
were
beginning
to
be
disgusted
it
was
only
a
fluke
after
all
they
said
to
each
other
colonel
drew
was
appealed
to
urge
monty
to
save
himself
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
remonstrance
when
the
message
came
that
the
threatened
strike
was
off
and
that
the
men
were
willing
to
arbitrate
almost
before
one
could
draw
breath
this
startling
news
began
to
make
itself
felt
the
certainty
of
a
great
strike
was
one
of
the
things
that
had
made
brewster
sure
that
the
price
could
not
hold
with
this
danger
removed
there
was
nothing
to
jeopardize
the
earning
power
of
the
stock
the
next
quotation
was
a
point
higher
you
sly
dog
said
the
colonel
digging
monty
in
the
side
i
had
confidence
in
you
all
the
time
in
ten
minutes
time
lumber
and
fuel
was
up
to
and
soaring
brewster
rushed
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
gardner
the
broker
hoarse
with
excitement
was
delighted
when
he
recognized
brewster
voice
you
a
wonder
monty
i
see
you
after
the
close
how
the
devil
did
you
do
it
shouted
gardner
what
the
price
now
asked
brewster
one
thirteen
and
and
going
up
all
the
time
hooray
do
you
think
she
go
down
again
demanded
brewster
not
if
i
can
help
it
very
well
then
go
and
sell
out
roared
brewster
but
she
going
up
like
sell
damn
you
did
you
hear
gardner
dazed
and
weak
began
selling
and
finally
liquidated
the
full
line
at
prices
ranging
from
to
but
montgomery
brewster
had
cleared
and
all
because
it
was
he
and
not
the
market
that
got
excited
chapter
xi
coals
of
fire
it
was
not
that
he
had
realized
heavily
in
his
investments
which
caused
his
friends
and
his
enemies
to
regard
him
in
a
new
light
his
profit
had
been
quite
small
as
things
go
on
the
exchange
in
these
days
the
mere
fact
that
he
had
shown
such
foresight
proved
sufficient
cause
for
the
reversal
of
opinion
men
looked
at
him
with
new
interest
in
their
eyes
with
fresh
confidence
his
unfortunate
operations
in
the
stock
market
had
restored
him
to
favor
in
all
circles
the
man
young
or
old
who
could
do
what
he
had
done
with
lumber
and
fuel
well
deserved
the
new
promises
that
were
being
made
for
him
brewster
bobbed
uncertainly
between
two
emotions
elation
and
distress
he
had
achieved
two
kinds
of
success
the
desired
and
the
undesired
it
was
but
natural
that
he
should
feel
proud
of
the
distinction
the
venture
had
brought
to
him
on
one
hand
but
there
was
reason
for
despair
over
the
acquisition
of
it
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
undertake
an
almost
superhuman
feat
increase
the
number
of
his
january
bills
the
plans
for
the
ensuing
spring
and
summer
were
dimly
getting
into
shape
and
they
covered
many
startling
projects
since
confiding
some
of
them
to
nopper
harrison
that
gentleman
had
worn
a
look
of
worry
and
anxiety
in
his
eyes
rawles
added
to
his
despair
a
day
or
two
after
the
stock
exchange
misfortune
he
brought
up
the
information
that
six
splendid
little
puppies
had
come
to
bless
his
boston
terrier
family
and
joe
bragdon
who
was
present
enthusiastically
predicted
that
he
could
get
apiece
for
them
brewster
loved
dogs
yet
for
one
single
horrible
moment
he
longed
to
massacre
the
helpless
little
creatures
but
the
old
affection
came
back
to
him
and
he
hurried
out
with
bragdon
to
inspect
the
brood
and
i
either
got
to
sell
them
or
kill
them
he
groaned
later
on
he
instructed
bragdon
to
sell
the
pups
for
apiece
and
went
away
ashamed
to
look
their
proud
mother
in
the
face
fortune
smiled
on
him
before
the
day
was
over
however
he
took
subway
smith
for
a
ride
in
the
green
juggernaut
bad
weather
and
bad
roads
notwithstanding
monty
lost
control
of
the
machine
and
headed
for
a
subway
excavation
he
and
smith
saved
themselves
by
leaping
to
the
pavement
sustaining
slight
bruises
but
the
great
machine
crashed
through
the
barricade
and
dropped
to
the
bottom
of
the
trench
far
below
to
smith
grief
and
brewster
delight
the
automobile
was
hopelessly
ruined
a
clear
loss
of
many
thousands
monty
joy
was
for
it
was
soon
learned
that
three
luckless
workmen
down
in
the
depths
had
been
badly
injured
by
the
green
meteor
from
above
the
mere
fact
that
brewster
could
and
did
pay
liberally
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
fellows
afforded
him
little
consolation
his
carelessness
and
possibly
his
indifference
had
brought
suffering
to
these
men
and
their
families
which
was
not
pleasant
to
look
back
upon
lawsuits
were
avoided
by
compromises
each
of
the
injured
men
received
at
this
time
every
one
was
interested
in
the
charity
bazaar
at
the
astoria
society
was
on
exhibition
and
the
public
paid
for
the
privilege
of
gazing
at
the
men
and
women
whose
names
filled
the
society
columns
brewster
frequented
the
booth
presided
over
by
miss
drew
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
his
philanthropy
the
bazaar
lasted
two
days
and
nights
and
after
that
period
his
showed
an
even
profit
of
nearly
monty
serenity
however
was
considerably
ruffled
by
the
appearance
of
a
new
and
aggressive
claimant
for
the
smiles
of
the
fair
barbara
he
was
a
californian
of
immense
wealth
and
unbounded
confidence
in
himself
and
letters
to
people
in
new
york
had
given
him
a
certain
entree
the
triumphs
in
love
and
finance
that
had
come
with
his
two
score
years
and
ten
had
demolished
every
vestige
of
timidity
that
may
have
been
born
with
him
he
was
successful
enough
in
the
world
of
finance
to
have
become
four
or
five
times
a
millionaire
and
he
had
fared
so
well
in
love
that
twice
he
had
been
a
widower
rodney
grimes
was
starting
out
to
win
barbara
with
the
same
dash
and
impulsiveness
that
overcame
mary
farrell
the
cook
in
the
and
jane
boothroyd
the
who
came
to
california
ready
to
marry
the
first
man
who
asked
her
he
was
a
penniless
prospector
when
he
married
mary
and
when
he
led
jane
to
the
altar
she
rejoiced
in
having
captured
a
husband
worth
at
least
he
vied
with
brewster
in
patronizing
barbara
booth
and
he
rushed
into
the
conflict
with
an
impetuosity
that
seemed
destined
to
carry
everything
before
it
monty
was
brushed
aside
barbara
was
preempted
as
if
she
were
a
mining
claim
and
ten
days
after
his
arrival
in
new
york
grimes
was
the
most
man
in
town
brewster
was
not
the
sort
to
be
dispatched
without
a
struggle
however
recognizing
grimes
as
an
obstacle
but
not
as
a
rival
he
once
more
donned
his
armor
and
beset
barbara
with
all
the
zest
of
a
champion
who
seeks
to
protect
and
not
to
conquer
he
regarded
the
californian
as
an
impostor
and
summary
action
was
necessary
i
know
all
about
him
babs
he
said
one
day
after
he
felt
sure
of
his
position
why
his
father
was
honored
by
the
c
on
the
coast
in
the
victoria
cross
asked
barbara
innocently
no
the
vigilance
committee
in
this
way
monty
routed
the
enemy
and
cleared
the
field
before
the
end
of
another
week
grimes
transferred
his
objectionable
affection
and
barbara
was
not
even
asked
to
be
wife
number
three
brewster
campaign
was
so
ardent
that
he
neglected
other
duties
deplorably
falling
far
behind
his
improvident
average
with
grimes
disposed
of
he
once
more
forsook
the
battlefield
of
love
and
gave
his
harassed
and
undivided
attention
to
his
own
peculiar
business
the
game
displeased
miss
barbara
greatly
she
was
at
first
surprised
then
piqued
then
resentful
monty
gradually
awoke
to
the
distressing
fact
that
she
was
going
to
be
intractable
as
he
put
it
and
forthwith
undertook
to
smooth
the
troubled
sea
to
his
amazement
and
concern
she
was
not
to
be
appeased
does
it
occur
to
you
monty
she
said
with
a
gentle
coldness
that
was
infinitely
worse
than
heat
that
you
have
been
carrying
things
with
a
pretty
high
hand
where
did
you
acquire
the
right
to
interfere
with
my
privileges
you
seem
to
think
that
i
am
not
to
speak
to
any
man
but
you
o
come
now
babs
retorted
monty
i
not
been
quite
as
unreasonable
as
that
and
you
know
yourself
that
grimes
is
the
worst
kind
of
a
bounder
i
know
nothing
of
the
sort
replied
the
lady
with
growing
irritation
you
say
that
about
every
man
who
gives
me
a
smile
or
a
flower
does
it
indicate
such
atrocious
taste
do
be
silly
barbara
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
have
talked
to
gardner
and
that
idiot
valentine
by
the
hour
and
i
not
said
a
word
but
there
are
some
things
i
ca
stand
and
the
impertinence
of
grimes
is
one
of
them
jove
he
looked
at
you
out
of
those
fishy
eyes
sometimes
as
though
he
owned
you
if
you
knew
how
many
times
fairly
ached
to
knock
him
down
inwardly
barbara
was
weakening
a
little
before
his
masterfulness
but
she
gave
no
sign
and
it
never
occurred
to
you
she
said
with
that
exasperating
coldness
of
the
voice
that
i
was
equal
to
the
situation
i
suppose
you
thought
grimes
had
only
to
beckon
and
i
would
joyfully
answer
i
have
you
know
monty
brewster
right
now
that
i
am
quite
able
to
choose
my
friends
and
to
handle
them
grimes
has
character
and
i
like
him
he
has
seen
more
of
life
in
a
year
of
his
strenuous
career
than
you
ever
dreamed
of
in
all
your
pampered
existence
his
life
has
been
real
monty
brewster
and
yours
is
only
an
imitation
it
struck
him
hard
but
it
left
him
gentle
babs
he
said
softly
i
ca
take
that
from
you
you
do
really
mean
it
do
you
am
i
as
bad
as
that
it
was
a
moment
for
dominance
and
he
missed
it
his
gentleness
left
her
cold
monty
she
exclaimed
irritably
you
are
terribly
exasperating
do
make
up
your
mind
that
you
and
your
million
are
not
the
only
things
in
the
world
his
blood
was
up
now
but
it
flung
him
away
from
her
some
day
perhaps
you
find
out
that
there
is
not
much
besides
i
am
just
a
little
too
big
for
one
thing
to
be
played
with
and
thrown
aside
i
wo
stand
it
he
left
the
house
with
his
head
high
in
the
air
angry
red
in
his
cheeks
and
a
feeling
in
his
heart
that
she
was
the
most
unreasonable
of
women
barbara
in
the
meantime
cried
herself
to
sleep
vowing
she
would
never
love
monty
brewster
again
as
long
as
she
lived
a
sharp
cutting
wind
was
blowing
in
monty
face
as
he
left
the
house
he
was
thoroughly
wretched
throw
up
your
hands
came
hoarsely
from
somewhere
and
there
was
no
tenderness
in
the
tones
for
an
instant
monty
was
dazed
and
bewildered
but
in
the
next
he
saw
two
shadowy
figures
walking
beside
him
stop
where
you
are
young
fellow
was
the
next
command
and
he
stopped
short
he
was
in
a
mood
to
fight
but
the
sight
of
a
revolver
made
him
think
again
monty
was
not
a
coward
neither
was
he
a
fool
he
was
quick
to
see
that
a
struggle
would
be
madness
what
do
you
want
he
demanded
as
coolly
as
his
nerves
would
permit
put
up
your
hands
quick
and
he
hastily
obeyed
the
injunction
not
a
sound
out
of
you
or
you
get
it
good
and
proper
you
know
what
we
want
get
to
work
bill
i
watch
his
hands
help
yourselves
boys
i
not
fool
enough
to
scrap
about
it
hit
me
or
shoot
that
all
be
quick
about
it
because
i
take
cold
if
my
overcoat
is
open
long
how
business

brewster
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
calmest
man
in
new
york
fierce
said
the
one
who
was
doing
the
searching

first
guy

in
a
week

good
i
hope

disappointed
said
monty
genially
if

this
i
might
have
brought
more
money
i
guess
we
be
satisfied
chuckled
the
man
with
the
revolver
you
awful
nice
and
kind
mister
and
maybe
you
would
object
to
tellin
us
when
you

up
dis

a
pleasure
to
do
business
with
you
pardner
said
the
other
dropping
monty
watch
in
his
pocket
we
leave
for
you
for
your
honesty
his
hands
were
running
through
pockets
with
the
quickness
of
a
machine
you
do
go
much
on
jewelry
i
guess

dese
shoit
buttons

monty
cheerfully

pardner
i

came
in
chuckles
from
the
two
men
but
brewster
hesitated
a
sharp
thought
penetrating
his
mind
by
gad
he
exclaimed
you
chaps
are
very
careless
do
you
know
you
missed
a
roll
of
three
hundred
dollars
in
this
overcoat
pocket
the
men
gasped
and
the
spasmodic
oaths
that
came
from
them
were
born
of
incredulity
it
was
plain
that
they
doubted
their
ears
say
it
muttered
bill
in
bewildered
tones
he
stringin
us
bill
said
the
other
sure
growled
bill
it
a
nice
way
to
treat
us
mister
move
along
now
and
do
turn
well
you
a
couple
of
nice
highwaymen
cried
monty
in
disgust
sh
not
so
loud
that
is
no
way
to
attend
to
business
do
you
expect
me
to
go
down
in
my
pocket
and
hand
you
the
goods
on
a
silver
tray
keep
your
hands

bill
dazed
and
bewildered
blowed
if

he
in
honest
amazement

monty

jiffy

dumfounded
robbers

brewster
found
his
coat
a
few
minutes
later
and
went
whistling
away
into
the
night
the
roll
of
bills
was
gone
chapter
xii
christmas
despair
brewster
made
a
good
story
of
the
at
the
club
but
he
did
not
relate
all
the
details
one
of
the
listeners
was
a
new
public
commissioner
who
was
aggressive
in
his
efforts
at
reform
accordingly
brewster
was
summoned
to
headquarters
the
next
morning
for
the
purpose
of
looking
over
the
suspects
that
had
been
brought
in
almost
the
first
man
that
he
espied
was
a
fellow
whose
identity
could
not
be
mistaken
it
was
bill
hello
bill
called
monty
gaily
bill
ground
his
teeth
for
a
second
but
his
eyes
had
such
an
appeal
in
them
that
monty
relented
you
know
this
fellow
mr
brewster
demanded
the
captain
quickly
bill
looked
utterly
helpless
know
bill
questioned
monty
in
surprise
of
course
i
do
captain
he
was
picked
up
late
last
night
and
detained
because
he
would
give
no
account
of
his
actions
was
it
as
bad
as
that
bill
asked
brewster
with
a
smile
bill
mumbled
something
and
assumed
a
look
of
defiance
monty
attitude
puzzled
him
sorely
he
hardly
breathed
for
an
instant
and
gulped
perceptibly
pass
bill
captain
he
was
with
me
last
night
just
before
my
money
was
taken
and
he
could
possibly
have
robbed
me
without
my
knowledge
wait
for
me
outside
bill
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
quite
sure
neither
of
the
thieves
is
here
captain
concluded
brewster
after
bill
had
obeyed
the
order
to
step
out
of
the
line
outside
the
door
the
puzzled
crook
met
brewster
who
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
you
a
peach
whispered
bill
gratefully
what
did
you
do
it
for
mister
because
you
were
kind
enough
not
to
cut
my
shirt
say
you
all
right
that
what
would
you
mind
havin
a
drink
with
me
it
your
money
but
the
drink
wo
be
any
the
worse
for
that
we
blowed
most
of
it
already
but
here
what
left
bill
handed
monty
a
roll
of
bills
i
a
kept
it
if
you
made
a
fight
he
continued
but
it
square
to
keep
it
now
brewster
refused
the
money
but
took
back
his
watch
keep
it
bill
he
said
you
need
it
more
than
i
do
it
enough
to
set
you
up
in
some
other
trade
why
not
try
it
i
will
try
boss
and
bill
was
so
profuse
in
his
thanks
that
monty
had
difficulty
in
getting
away
as
he
climbed
into
a
cab
he
heard
bill
say
i
will
try
boss
and
say
if
ever
i
can
do
anything
for
you
put
me
nex
i
nex
you
all
de
time
he
gave
the
driver
the
name
of
his
club
but
as
he
was
passing
the
waldorf
he
remembered
that
he
had
several
things
to
say
to
dan
the
order
was
changed
and
a
few
moments
later
he
was
received
in
dan
very
special
den
she
wore
something
soft
and
graceful
in
lavender
something
that
was
light
and
wavy
and
evanescent
and
made
you
watch
its
changing
shadows
monty
looked
down
at
her
with
the
feeling
that
she
made
a
very
effective
picture
you
are
looking
pretty
fit
this
morning
my
lady
he
said
by
way
of
preamble
how
well
everything
plays
up
to
you
and
you
are
unusually
courtly
monty
she
smiled
has
the
world
treated
you
so
generously
of
late
it
is
treating
me
generously
enough
just
now
to
make
up
for
anything
and
he
looked
at
her
do
you
know
dan
that
it
is
borne
in
upon
me
now
and
then
that
there
are
things
that
are
quite
worth
while
oh
if
you
come
to
that
she
answered
lightly
everything
is
worth
while
for
you
monty
life
is
certainly
not
slow
you
can
dominate
you
can
make
things
go
your
way
are
they
going
your
way
now
monty
this
more
seriously
what
wrong
is
the
pace
too
fast
his
mood
increased
upon
him
with
her
sympathy
oh
no
he
said
it
is
that
you
are
good
and
i
a
selfish
beast
things
are
perverse
and
people
are
desperately
obstinate
sometimes
and
here
i
am
taking
it
out
on
you
you
are
not
perverse
you
are
not
obstinate
you
are
a
ripper
dan
and
you
are
going
to
help
me
out
in
more
ways
than
one
well
to
pay
for
all
these
gallantries
monty
i
ought
to
do
much
your
friend
through
thick
and
thin
you
have
only
to
command
me
it
was
precisely
to
get
your
help
that
i
came
in
i
tired
of
those
confounded
dinners
you
know
yourself
that
they
are
all
alike
the
same
people
the
same
flowers
the
same
things
to
eat
and
the
same
inane
twaddle
in
the
shape
of
talk
who
cares
about
them
anyway
well
i
like
that
she
interrupted
after
all
the
thought
i
put
into
those
dinners
after
all
the
variety
i
so
carefully
secured
my
dear
boy
you
are
frightfully
ungrateful
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
and
you
know
quite
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
is
perfectly
true
the
dinners
were
a
beastly
bore
which
proves
that
they
were
a
loud
success
your
work
was
not
done
in
vain
but
now
i
want
something
else
we
must
push
along
the
ball
we
been
talking
of
and
the
yachting
cruise
that
ca
wait
very
much
longer
the
ball
first
she
decreed
i
see
to
the
cards
at
once
and
in
a
day
or
two
i
have
a
list
ready
for
your
gracious
approval
and
what
have
you
done
pettingill
has
some
great
ideas
for
doing
over
sherry
harrison
is
in
communication
with
the
manager
of
that
hungarian
orchestra
you
spoke
of
and
he
finds
the
men
quite
ready
for
a
little
jaunt
across
the
water
we
have
that
military
band
i
forgotten
the
number
of
its
regiment
for
the
promenade
music
and
the
new
paris
sensation
the
contralto
is
coming
over
with
her
primo
tenore
for
some
special
numbers
you
were
certainly
cut
out
for
an
executive
monty
said
dan
but
with
the
music
and
the
decorations
arranged
you
only
begun
the
favors
are
the
real
thing
and
if
you
say
the
word
we
surprise
them
a
little
do
worry
about
it
monty
it
a
go
already
pull
it
off
together
you
are
a
thoroughbred
dan
he
exclaimed
you
do
help
a
fellow
at
a
pinch
that
all
right
monty
she
answered
give
me
until
after
christmas
and
i
have
the
finest
favors
ever
seen
other
people
may
have
their
paper
hats
and
pink
ribbons
but
you
can
show
them
how
the
thing
ought
to
be
done
her
reference
to
christmas
haunted
brewster
as
he
drove
down
fifth
avenue
with
the
dread
of
a
new
disaster
never
before
had
he
looked
upon
presents
as
a
calamity
but
this
year
it
was
different
immediately
he
began
to
plan
a
bombardment
of
his
friends
with
costly
trinkets
when
he
grew
suddenly
doubtful
of
the
opinion
of
his
executor
upon
this
move
but
in
response
to
a
telegram
swearengen
jones
with
pleasing
irascibility
informed
him
that
anyone
with
a
drop
of
human
kindness
in
his
body
would
consider
it
his
duty
to
give
christmas
presents
to
those
who
deserved
them
monty
way
was
now
clear
if
his
friends
meant
to
handicap
him
with
gifts
he
knew
a
way
to
get
even
for
two
weeks
his
mornings
were
spent
at
tiffany
and
the
afternoons
brought
joy
to
the
heart
of
every
dealer
in
antiquities
in
fourth
and
fifth
avenues
he
gave
much
thought
to
the
matter
in
the
effort
to
secure
many
small
articles
which
elaborately
concealed
their
value
and
he
had
taste
the
result
of
his
endeavor
was
that
many
friends
who
would
not
have
thought
of
remembering
monty
with
even
a
card
were
pleasantly
surprised
on
christmas
eve
as
it
turned
out
he
fared
very
well
in
the
matter
of
gifts
and
for
some
days
much
of
his
time
was
spent
in
reading
notes
of
profuse
thanks
which
were
yet
vaguely
apologetic
the
grays
and
dan
had
remembered
him
with
an
agreeable
lack
of
ostentation
and
some
of
the
little
sons
of
the
rich
who
had
kept
one
evening
a
fortnight
open
for
the
purpose
of
using
up
their
at
monty
were
only
too
generously
grateful
miss
drew
had
forgotten
him
and
when
they
met
after
the
holiday
her
recognition
was
of
the
coldest
he
had
thought
that
under
the
circumstances
he
could
send
her
a
gift
of
value
but
the
beautiful
pearls
with
which
he
asked
for
a
reconciliation
were
returned
with
miss
drew
thanks
he
loved
barbara
sincerely
and
it
cut
peggy
gray
was
taken
into
his
confidence
and
he
was
comforted
by
her
encouragement
it
was
a
bit
difficult
for
her
to
advise
him
to
try
again
but
his
happiness
was
a
thing
she
had
at
heart
it
beastly
unfair
peggy
he
said
i
really
been
white
to
her
i
believe
i
chuck
the
whole
business
and
leave
new
york
you
going
away
and
there
was
just
a
suggestion
of
a
catch
in
her
breath
i
going
to
charter
a
yacht
and
sail
away
from
this
place
for
three
or
four
months
peggy
fairly
gasped
what
do
you
think
of
the
scheme
he
added
noticing
the
alarm
and
incredulity
in
her
eyes
i
think
you
end
in
the
montgomery
brewster
she
said
with
a
laugh
chapter
xiii
a
friend
in
need
it
was
while
brewster
was
in
the
depths
of
despair
that
his
financial
affairs
had
a
windfall
one
of
the
banks
in
which
his
money
was
deposited
failed
and
his
balance
of
over
was
wiped
out
mismanagement
was
the
cause
and
the
collapse
came
on
friday
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
month
needless
to
say
it
destroyed
every
vestige
of
the
superstition
he
may
have
had
regarding
friday
and
the
number
thirteen
brewster
had
money
deposited
in
five
banks
a
transaction
inspired
by
the
wild
hope
that
one
of
them
might
some
day
suspend
operations
and
thereby
prove
a
legitimate
benefit
to
him
there
seemed
no
prospect
that
the
bank
could
resume
operations
and
if
the
depositors
in
the
end
realized
twenty
cents
on
the
dollar
they
would
be
fortunate
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
everybody
had
considered
the
institution
substantial
there
were
not
a
few
wiseacres
who
called
brewster
a
fool
and
were
so
unreasonable
as
to
say
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
handle
money
he
heard
that
miss
drew
in
particular
was
bitterly
sarcastic
in
referring
to
his
stupidity
this
failure
caused
a
tremendous
flurry
in
banking
circles
it
was
but
natural
that
questions
concerning
the
stability
of
other
banks
should
be
asked
and
it
was
not
long
before
many
wild
disquieting
reports
were
afloat
anxious
depositors
rushed
into
the
big
banking
institutions
and
then
rushed
out
again
partially
assured
that
there
was
no
danger
the
newspapers
sought
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
people
but
there
were
many
to
whom
fear
became
panic
there
were
short
wild
runs
on
some
of
the
smaller
banks
but
all
were
in
a
fair
way
to
restore
confidence
when
out
came
the
rumor
that
the
bank
of
manhattan
island
was
in
trouble
colonel
prentiss
drew
railroad
magnate
was
the
president
of
this
bank
when
the
bank
opened
for
business
on
the
tuesday
following
the
failure
there
was
a
stampede
of
frightened
depositors
before
eleven
the
run
had
assumed
ugly
proportions
and
no
amount
of
argument
could
stay
the
onslaught
colonel
drew
and
the
directors
at
first
mildly
distressed
and
then
seeing
that
the
affair
had
become
serious
grew
more
alarmed
than
they
could
afford
to
let
the
public
see
the
loans
of
all
the
banks
were
unusually
large
incipient
runs
on
some
had
put
all
of
them
in
an
attitude
of
caution
and
there
was
a
natural
reluctance
to
expose
their
own
interests
to
jeopardy
by
coming
to
the
relief
of
the
bank
of
manhattan
island
monty
brewster
had
something
like
in
colonel
drew
bank
he
would
not
have
regretted
on
his
own
account
the
collapse
of
this
institution
but
he
realized
what
it
meant
to
the
hundreds
of
other
depositors
and
for
the
first
time
he
appreciated
what
his
money
could
accomplish
thinking
that
his
presence
might
give
confidence
to
the
other
depositors
and
stop
the
run
he
went
over
to
the
bank
with
harrison
and
bragdon
the
tellers
were
handing
out
thousands
of
dollars
to
the
eager
depositors
his
friends
advised
him
strongly
to
withdraw
before
it
was
too
late
but
monty
was
obdurate
they
set
it
down
to
his
desire
to
help
barbara
father
and
admired
his
nerve
i
understand
monty
said
bragdon
and
both
he
and
harrison
went
among
the
people
carelessly
asking
one
another
if
brewster
had
come
to
withdraw
his
money
no
he
has
over
and
he
going
to
leave
it
the
other
would
say
each
excited
group
was
visited
in
turn
by
the
two
men
but
their
assurance
seemed
to
accomplish
but
little
these
men
and
women
were
there
to
save
their
fortunes
the
situation
was
desperate
colonel
drew
outwardly
calm
and
serene
but
inwardly
perturbed
finally
saw
brewster
and
his
companions
he
sent
a
messenger
over
with
the
request
that
monty
come
to
the
president
private
office
at
once
he
wants
to
help
you
to
save
your
money
cried
bragdon
in
low
tones
that
shows
it
all
up
get
out
every
dollar
of
it
monty
and
do
waste
a
minute
it
a
smash
as
sure
as
fate
urged
harrison
a
feverish
expression
in
his
eyes
brewster
was
admitted
to
the
colonel
private
office
drew
was
alone
and
was
pacing
the
floor
like
a
caged
animal
sit
down
brewster
and
do
mind
if
i
seem
nervous
of
course
we
can
hold
out
but
it
is
terrible
terrible
they
think
we
are
trying
to
rob
them
they
mad
utterly
mad
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
colonel
are
you
sure
you
can
meet
all
the
demands
asked
brewster
thoroughly
excited
the
colonel
face
was
white
and
he
chewed
his
cigar
nervously
we
can
hold
out
unless
some
of
our
heaviest
depositors
get
the
fever
and
swoop
down
upon
us
i
appreciate
your
feelings
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
coming
so
swiftly
upon
the
heels
of
the
other
but
i
want
to
give
you
my
personal
assurance
that
the
money
you
have
here
is
safe
i
called
you
in
to
impress
you
with
the
security
of
the
bank
you
ought
to
know
the
truth
however
and
i
will
tell
you
in
confidence
that
another
check
like
austin
which
we
paid
a
few
minutes
ago
would
cause
us
serious
though
temporary
embarrassment
i
came
to
assure
you
that
i
have
not
thought
of
withdrawing
my
deposits
from
this
bank
colonel
you
need
have
no
uneasiness
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
one
of
the
officials
of
the
bank
bolted
inside
his
face
as
white
as
death
he
started
to
speak
before
he
saw
brewster
and
then
closed
his
lips
despairingly
what
is
it
mr
moore
asked
drew
as
calmly
as
possible
do
mind
mr
brewster
oglethorp
wants
to
draw
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
said
moore
in
strained
tones
well
he
can
have
it
ca
he
asked
the
colonel
quietly
moore
looked
helplessly
at
the
president
of
the
bank
and
his
silence
spoke
more
plainly
than
words
brewster
it
looks
bad
said
the
colonel
turning
abruptly
to
the
young
man
the
other
banks
are
afraid
of
a
run
and
we
ca
count
on
much
help
from
them
some
of
them
have
helped
us
and
others
have
refused
now
i
not
only
ask
you
to
refrain
from
drawing
out
your
deposit
but
i
want
you
to
help
us
in
this
crucial
moment
the
colonel
looked
twenty
years
older
and
his
voice
shook
perceptibly
pity
went
out
to
him
in
a
flash
what
can
i
do
colonel
drew
he
cried
i
not
take
my
money
out
but
i
do
know
how
i
can
be
of
further
assistance
to
you
command
me
sir
you
can
restore
absolute
confidence
monty
my
dear
boy
by
increasing
your
deposits
in
our
bank
said
the
colonel
slowly
and
as
if
dreading
the
fate
of
the
suggestion
you
mean
sir
that
i
can
save
the
bank
by
drawing
my
money
from
other
banks
and
putting
it
here
asked
monty
slowly
he
was
thinking
harder
and
faster
than
he
had
ever
thought
in
his
life
could
he
afford
to
risk
the
loss
of
his
entire
fortune
on
the
fate
of
this
bank
what
would
swearengen
jones
say
if
he
deliberately
deposited
a
vast
amount
of
money
in
a
tottering
institution
like
the
bank
of
manhattan
island
it
would
be
the
maddest
folly
on
his
part
if
the
bank
went
down
there
could
be
no
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
eyes
of
either
jones
or
the
world
if
he
swamped
all
of
his
money
in
this
crisis
i
beg
of
you
monty
help
us
the
colonel
pride
was
gone
it
means
disgrace
if
we
close
our
doors
even
for
an
hour
it
means
a
stain
that
only
years
can
remove
you
can
restore
confidence
by
a
dozen
strokes
of
your
pen
and
you
can
save
us
he
was
barbara
father
the
proud
old
man
was
before
him
as
a
suppliant
no
longer
the
cold
man
of
the
world
back
to
brewster
mind
came
the
thought
of
his
quarrel
with
barbara
and
of
her
heartlessness
a
scratch
of
the
pen
one
way
or
the
other
could
change
the
life
of
barbara
drew
the
two
bankers
stood
by
scarcely
breathing
from
the
outside
came
the
shuffle
of
many
feet
and
the
muffled
roll
of
voices
again
the
door
to
the
private
office
opened
and
a
clerk
excitedly
motioned
for
moore
to
hurry
to
the
front
of
the
bank
moore
paused
irresolutely
his
eyes
on
brewster
face
the
young
man
knew
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
help
or
deny
them
like
a
flash
the
situation
was
made
clear
to
him
and
his
duty
was
plain
he
remembered
that
the
bank
of
manhattan
island
held
every
dollar
that
gray
and
peggy
possessed
their
meager
fortune
had
been
entrusted
to
the
care
of
prentiss
drew
and
his
associates
and
it
was
in
danger
i
will
do
all
i
can
colonel
said
monty
but
upon
one
condition
that
is
barbara
must
never
know
of
this
the
colonel
gasp
of
astonishment
was
cut
short
as
monty
continued
promise
that
she
shall
never
know
i
do
understand
but
if
it
is
your
wish
i
promise
inside
of
half
an
hour
time
several
hundred
thousand
came
to
the
relief
of
the
struggling
bank
and
the
man
who
had
come
to
watch
the
run
with
curious
eyes
turned
out
to
be
its
savior
his
money
won
the
day
for
the
bank
of
manhattan
island
when
the
happy
president
and
directors
offered
to
pay
him
an
astonishingly
high
rate
of
interest
for
the
use
of
the
money
he
proudly
declined
the
next
day
miss
drew
issued
invitations
for
a
cotillon
montgomery
brewster
was
not
asked
to
attend
chapter
xiv
de
mille
entertains
miss
drew
cotillon
was
not
graced
by
the
presence
of
montgomery
brewster
it
is
true
he
received
an
invitation
and
a
very
cold
and
difficult
little
note
of
apology
but
he
maintained
heroically
the
air
of
disdain
that
had
succeeded
the
first
sharp
pangs
of
disappointment
colonel
drew
in
whose
good
graces
monty
had
firmly
established
himself
was
not
quite
guiltless
of
usurping
the
role
of
dictator
in
the
effort
to
patch
up
a
truce
a
few
nights
before
the
cotillon
when
barbara
told
him
that
herbert
ailing
was
to
lead
he
explosively
expressed
surprise
why
not
monty
brewster
babs
he
demanded
brewster
is
not
coming
she
responded
calmly
going
to
be
out
of
town
i
sure
i
do
not
know
stiffly
what
this
he
has
not
been
asked
father
miss
drew
was
not
in
good
humor
not
asked
said
the
colonel
in
amazement
it
ridiculous
babs
send
him
an
invitation
at
once
this
is
my
dance
father
and
i
do
want
to
ask
mr
brewster
the
colonel
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
struggled
to
overcome
his
anger
he
knew
that
barbara
had
inherited
his
willfulness
and
had
long
since
discovered
that
it
was
best
to
treat
her
with
tact
i
thought
you
and
he
were
but
the
colonel
supply
of
tact
was
exhausted
we
were
in
a
moment
of
absent
mindedness
but
it
all
over
said
barbara
why
child
there
would
have
been
a
cotillon
if
it
had
been
for
but
the
colonel
remembered
his
promise
to
monty
and
checked
himself
just
in
time
i
i
mean
there
will
not
be
any
party
if
montgomery
brewster
is
not
asked
that
is
all
i
care
to
say
on
the
subject
and
he
stamped
out
of
the
room
barbara
wept
copiously
after
her
father
had
gone
but
she
realized
that
his
will
was
law
and
that
monty
must
be
invited
i
will
send
an
invitation
she
said
to
herself
but
if
brewster
comes
after
he
has
read
it
i
shall
be
surprised
montgomery
however
did
not
receive
the
note
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
had
been
sent
he
only
saw
in
it
a
ray
of
hope
that
barbara
was
relenting
and
was
jubilant
at
the
prospect
of
a
reconciliation
the
next
sunday
he
sought
an
interview
with
miss
drew
but
she
received
him
with
icy
reserve
if
he
had
thought
to
punish
her
by
staying
away
it
was
evident
that
she
felt
equally
responsible
for
a
great
deal
of
misery
on
his
part
both
had
been
more
or
less
unhappy
and
both
were
resentfully
obstinate
brewster
felt
hurt
and
insulted
while
she
felt
that
he
had
imposed
upon
her
disgracefully
he
was
now
ready
to
cry
quits
and
it
surprised
him
to
find
her
obdurate
if
he
had
expected
to
dictate
the
terms
of
peace
he
was
woefully
disappointed
when
she
treated
his
advances
with
cool
contempt
barbara
you
know
i
care
very
much
for
you
he
was
pleading
fairly
on
the
road
to
submission
i
am
sure
you
are
not
quite
indifferent
to
me
this
foolish
misunderstanding
must
really
be
as
disagreeable
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
indeed
she
replied
lifting
her
brows
disdainfully
you
are
assuming
a
good
deal
mr
brewster
i
am
merely
recalling
the
fact
that
you
once
told
me
you
cared
you
would
not
promise
anything
i
know
but
it
meant
much
that
you
cared
a
little
difference
could
not
have
changed
your
feeling
completely
when
you
are
ready
to
treat
me
with
respect
i
may
listen
to
your
petition
she
said
rising
haughtily
my
petition
he
did
not
like
the
word
and
his
tact
quite
deserted
him
it
as
much
yours
as
mine
do
throw
the
burden
of
responsibility
on
me
miss
drew
have
i
suggested
going
back
to
the
old
relations
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
remind
you
of
the
fact
that
you
came
on
your
own
initiative
and
certainly
without
my
solicitation
now
look
here
barbara
he
began
dimly
realizing
that
it
was
going
to
be
hard
very
hard
to
reason
i
am
very
sorry
brewster
but
you
will
have
to
excuse
me
i
am
going
out
i
regret
exceedingly
that
i
should
have
disturbed
you
miss
drew
he
said
swallowing
his
pride
perhaps
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
as
he
was
leaving
the
house
deep
anger
in
his
soul
he
encountered
the
colonel
there
was
something
about
monty
greeting
cordial
as
it
was
that
gave
the
older
man
a
hint
as
to
the
situation
wo
you
stop
for
dinner
monty
he
asked
in
the
hope
that
his
suspicion
was
groundless
thank
you
colonel
not
and
he
was
off
before
the
colonel
could
hold
him
barbara
was
tearfully
angry
when
her
father
came
into
the
room
but
as
he
began
to
remonstrate
with
her
the
tears
disappeared
and
left
her
at
white
heat
frankly
father
you
do
understand
matters
she
said
with
slow
emphasis
i
wish
you
to
know
now
that
if
montgomery
brewster
calls
again
i
shall
not
see
him
if
that
is
your
point
of
view
barbara
i
wish
you
to
know
mine
the
colonel
rose
and
stood
over
her
everything
forgotten
but
the
rage
that
went
so
deep
that
it
left
the
surface
calm
throwing
aside
his
promise
to
brewster
he
told
barbara
with
dramatic
simplicity
the
story
of
the
rescue
of
the
bank
you
see
he
added
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
boy
we
would
now
be
ruined
instead
of
giving
cotillons
you
might
be
giving
music
lessons
montgomery
brewster
will
always
be
welcome
in
this
house
and
you
will
see
that
my
wishes
are
respected
do
you
understand
perfectly
barbara
answered
in
a
still
voice
as
your
friend
i
shall
try
to
be
civil
to
him
the
colonel
was
not
satisfied
with
so
an
acquiescence
but
he
wisely
retired
from
the
field
he
left
the
girl
silent
and
crushed
but
with
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
that
was
not
altogether
to
be
concealed
the
story
had
touched
her
more
deeply
than
she
would
willingly
confess
it
was
something
to
know
that
monty
brewster
could
do
a
thing
like
that
and
would
do
it
for
her
the
exultant
smile
which
it
brought
to
her
lips
could
only
be
made
to
disappear
by
reminding
herself
sharply
of
his
recent
arrogance
her
anger
she
found
was
a
plant
which
needed
careful
cultivation
it
was
in
a
somewhat
chastened
mood
that
she
started
a
few
days
later
for
a
dinner
at
the
demille
as
she
entered
in
her
sweeping
golden
gown
the
sight
of
monty
brewster
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
gave
her
a
flutter
at
the
heart
but
it
was
an
agitation
that
was
very
carefully
concealed
brewster
was
certainly
unconscious
of
it
to
him
the
position
of
guest
was
like
a
disguise
and
he
was
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
letting
himself
go
under
the
mask
without
responsibility
but
it
took
on
a
different
color
when
the
butler
handed
him
a
card
which
signified
that
he
was
to
take
miss
drew
in
to
dinner
hastily
seeking
out
the
hostess
he
endeavored
to
convey
to
her
the
impossibility
of
the
situation
i
hope
you
wo
misunderstand
me
he
said
but
is
it
too
late
to
change
my
place
at
the
table
it
is
conventional
i
know
monty
society
chief
aim
is
to
separate
engaged
couples
at
dinner
said
dan
with
a
laugh
it
would
be
positively
compromising
if
a
man
and
his
wife
sat
together
dinner
was
announced
before
monty
could
utter
another
word
and
as
she
led
him
over
to
barbara
she
said
behold
a
generous
hostess
who
gives
up
the
best
man
in
the
crowd
so
that
he
and
some
one
else
may
have
a
happy
time
i
leave
it
to
you
barbara
if
that
is
the
test
of
friendship
for
a
moment
the
two
riveted
their
eyes
on
the
floor
then
the
humor
of
the
situation
came
to
monty
i
did
not
know
that
we
were
supposed
to
do
gibson
tableaux
he
said
drily
as
he
proffered
his
arm
i
do
understand
and
barbara
curiosity
overcame
her
determination
not
to
speak
do
you
remember
the
picture
of
the
man
who
was
called
upon
to
take
his
late
fiancee
out
to
dinner
the
awful
silence
with
which
this
remark
was
received
put
an
end
to
further
efforts
at
humor
the
dinner
was
probably
the
most
painful
experience
in
their
lives
barbara
had
come
to
it
softened
and
ready
to
meet
him
half
way
the
right
kind
of
humility
in
monty
would
have
found
her
plastic
but
she
had
very
definite
and
rigid
ideas
of
his
duty
in
the
premises
and
monty
was
too
simple
minded
to
seem
to
suffer
and
much
too
flippant
to
understand
it
was
plain
to
each
that
the
other
did
not
expect
to
talk
but
they
both
realized
that
they
owed
a
duty
to
appearances
and
to
their
hostess
through
two
courses
at
least
there
was
dead
silence
between
them
it
seemed
as
though
every
eye
in
the
room
were
on
them
and
every
mind
were
speculating
at
last
in
sheer
desperation
barbara
turned
to
him
with
the
first
smile
he
had
seen
on
her
face
in
days
there
was
no
smile
in
her
eyes
however
and
monty
understood
we
might
at
least
give
out
the
impression
that
we
are
friends
she
said
quietly
more
easily
said
than
done
he
responded
gloomily
they
are
all
looking
at
us
and
wondering
i
do
blame
them
we
owe
something
to
dan
i
think
i
know
barbara
uttered
some
inanity
whenever
she
caught
any
one
looking
in
their
direction
but
brewster
seemed
not
to
hear
at
length
he
cut
short
some
remark
of
hers
about
the
weather
what
nonsense
this
is
barbara
he
said
with
any
one
else
i
would
chuck
the
whole
game
but
with
you
it
is
different
i
do
know
what
i
have
done
but
i
am
sorry
i
hope
you
forgive
me
your
assurance
is
amusing
to
say
the
least
but
i
am
sure
i
know
this
quarrel
is
something
we
laugh
over
you
keep
forgetting
that
we
are
going
to
be
married
some
day
a
new
light
came
into
barbara
eyes
you
forget
that
my
consent
may
be
necessary
she
said
you
will
be
perfectly
willing
when
the
time
comes
i
am
still
in
the
fight
and
eventually
you
will
come
to
my
way
of
thinking
oh
i
see
it
now
said
barbara
and
her
blood
was
up
you
mean
to
force
me
to
it
what
you
did
for
father
brewster
glowered
at
her
thinking
that
he
had
misunderstood
what
do
you
mean
he
said
he
has
told
me
all
about
that
wretched
bank
business
but
poor
father
thought
you
quite
disinterested
he
did
not
see
the
little
game
behind
your
melodrama
he
would
have
torn
up
your
check
on
the
instant
if
he
had
suspected
you
were
trying
to
buy
his
daughter
does
your
father
believe
that
asked
brewster
no
but
i
see
it
all
now
his
persistence
and
yours
you
were
not
slow
to
grasp
the
opportunity
offered
stop
miss
drew
monty
commanded
his
voice
had
changed
and
she
had
never
before
seen
that
look
in
his
eyes
you
need
have
no
fear
that
i
will
trouble
you
again

no

of
amusement

the

miss

by
her

and
the
little

wondered
why
monty
did
not
see
the
humor
of
it
he
has
too
bad
an
attack
to
see
anything
but
the

one
evening
when
the

were

for
an
supper
party
it
always
the
way
commented
the
philosophical

when
you
lose
your
heart
your
sense
of
humor
goes
too
engaged
couples
do
such
ridiculous
stunts
if
they
had
the
least
particle

it

fell
like
a
bombshell
the
thought

come
to
every
one
but
no
one
had
been

the
courage
to
utter
it
for
them
brewster
silence
on
the
subject
since
the
demille
dinner
seemed
to
have
something
ominous
behind
it
it
probably
only
a
lovers
quarrel
said
bragdon
but
further
comment
was
cut
short
by
the
entrance
of
monty
himself
and
they
took
their
places
at
the
table
before
the
evening
came
to
an
end
they
were
in
possession
of
many
astonishing
details
in
connection
with
the
coming
ball
monty
did
not
say
that
it
was
to
be
given
for
miss
drew
and
her
name
was
conspicuously
absent
from
his
descriptions
as
he
unfolded
his
plans
even
the
little
sons
who
were
imaginative
by
instinct
and
reckless
on
principle
could
not
be
quite
acquiescent
nopper
harrison
solemnly
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
ball
would
cost
brewster
at
least
the
little
sons
looked
at
one
another
in
consternation
while
brewster
indifference
expressed
itself
in
an
unflattering
comment
upon
his
friend
vulgarity
good
lord
nopper
he
added
you
would
speculate
about
the
price
of
gloves
for
your
wedding
harrison
resented
the
taunt
it
would
be
much
less
vulgar
to
do
that
monty
saving
your
presence
than
to
force
your
millions
down
every
one
throat
well
they
swallow
them
i
noticed
retorted
brewster
as
though
they
were
chocolates
pettingill
interrupted
grandiloquently
my
friends
and
gentlemen
which

which

casually
but
the

permit
me
to
present
to
you
the

his

and

and
yet
they
maintain
that
silence

absolutely
criminal
cried

over

they

half
that

than
forty
thousand

nopper
dolefully
and
there

lamented
subway
smith
all
that
glory
wasted
on
two
hundred
rank
outsiders
you
men
are
borrowing
a
lot
of
trouble
yawned
brewster
with
a
gallant
effort
to
seem
bored
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
come
to
the
party
and
put
up
a
good
imitation
of
having
the
time
of
your
life
between
you
and
me
i
rather
be
caught
at
huyler
drinking
ice
cream
soda
than
giving
this
thing
but
that
what
we
want
to
know
but
what
and
subway
leaned
forward
eagerly
but
continued
monty
i
in
for
it
now
and
it
is
going
to
be
a
ball
that
is
a
ball
nevertheless
the
optimistic
brewster
could
not
find
the
courage
to
tell
peggy
of
these
picturesque
extravagances
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
he
blandly
informed
her
that
he
was
getting
off
much
more
cheaply
than
he
had
expected
he
laughingly
denounced
as
untrue
the
stories
that
had
come
to
her
from
outside
sources
and
before
his
convincing
assertions
that
reports
were
ridiculously
exaggerated
the
troubled
expression
in
the
girl
eyes
disappeared
i
must
seem
a
fool
groaned
monty
as
he
left
the
house
after
one
of
these
explanatory
trials
but
what
will
she
think
of
me
toward
the
end
of
the
year
when
i
am
really
in
harness
he
found
it
hard
to
control
the
desire
to
be
straight
with
peggy
and
tell
her
the
story
of
his
mad
race
in
pursuit
of
poverty
preparations
for
the
ball
went
on
steadily
and
in
a
dull
winter
it
had
its
color
value
for
society
it
was
to
be
a
spanish
and
at
many
the
talk
of
it
was
a
sarcastic
as
it
frequently
was
on
the
question
of
monty
extravagance
there
was
a
splendor
about
the
entertainment
which
had
a
charm
beneath
the
outward
disapproval
there
was
a
secret
admiration
of
the
superb
nerve
of
the
man
and
there
was
little
reluctance
to
help
him
in
the
wild
career
he
had
chosen
it
was
so
easy
to
go
with
him
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
let
him
take
the
plunge
alone
only
the
echo
of
the
criticism
reached
brewster
for
he
had
silenced
harrison
with
work
and
pettingill
with
opportunities
it
troubled
him
little
as
he
was
engaged
in
jotting
down
items
that
swelled
the
profit
side
of
his
ledger
account
enormously
the
ball
was
bound
to
give
him
a
good
lead
in
the
race
once
more
despite
the
heavy
handicap
the
stock
exchange
had
imposed
the
little
sons
took
off
their
coats
and
helped
pettingill
in
the
work
of
preparation
he
found
them
quite
superfluous
for
their
ideas
never
agreed
and
each
man
had
a
way
of
preferring
his
own
suggestion
to
brewster
chagrin
they
were
united
in
the
effort
to
curb
his
extravagance
he
be
giving
automobiles
and
ropes
of
pearls
for
favors
if
we
stop
him
said
subway
smith
after
monty
had
ordered
a
vintage
champagne
to
be
served
during
the
entire
evening
give
them
two
glasses
first
if
you
like
and
then
they
wo
mind
if
they
have
cider
the
rest
of
the
night
monty
is
plain
dotty
chimed
bragdon
and
the
pace
is
beginning
to
tell
on
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
pace
was
beginning
to
tell
on
brewster
work
and
worry
were
plainly
having
an
effect
on
his
health
his
color
was
bad
his
eyes
were
losing
their
lustre
and
there
was
a
listlessness
in
his
actions
that
even
determined
effort
could
not
conceal
from
his
friends
little
fits
of
fever
annoyed
him
occasionally
and
he
admitted
that
he
did
not
feel
quite
right
something
is
wrong
somewhere
he
said
ruefully
and
my
whole
system
seems
ready
to
stop
work
through
sympathy
suddenly
there
was
a
mighty
check
to
the
preparations
two
days
before
the
date
set
for
the
ball
everything
came
to
a
standstill
and
the
managers
sank
back
in
perplexity
and
consternation
monty
brewster
was
critically
appendicitis
the
doctors
called
it
and
an
operation
was
imperative
thank
heaven
it
fashionable
laughed
monty
who
showed
no
fear
of
the
prospect
how
ridiculous
if
it
had
been
the
mumps
or
if
the
newspapers
had
said
account
of
the
brewster
did
not
attend
his
ball
you
do
mean
to
say
the
ball
is
off
of
course
and
harrison
was
really
alarmed
not
a
bit
of
it
nopper
said
monty
it
what
i
been
wanting
all
along
you
chaps
do
the
handshaking
and
i
stay
at
home
there
was
an
immediate
council
of
war
when
this
piece
of
news
was
announced
and
the
little
sons
were
unanimous
in
favor
of
recalling
the
invitations
and
declaring
the
party
off
at
first
monty
was
obdurate
but
when
some
one
suggested
that
he
could
give
the
ball
later
on
after
he
was
well
he
relented
the
opportunity
to
double
the
cost
by
giving
two
parties
was
not
to
be
ignored
call
it
off
then
but
say
it
is
only
postponed
a
great
rushing
to
and
fro
resulted
in
the
cancelling
of
contracts
the
recalling
of
invitations
the
settling
of
accounts
with
the
most
loyal
effort
to
save
as
much
as
possible
from
the
wreckage
harrison
and
his
associates
almost
frantic
with
fear
for
brewster
life
managed
to
perform
wonders
in
the
few
hours
of
grace
gardner
with
rare
foresight
saw
that
the
viennese
orchestra
would
prove
a
dead
loss
he
suggested
the
possibility
of
a
concert
tour
through
the
country
covering
several
weeks
and
monty
too
ill
to
care
one
way
or
the
other
authorized
him
to
carry
out
the
plan
if
it
seemed
feasible
to
monty
fearless
and
less
disturbed
than
any
other
member
of
his
circle
appendicitis
seemed
as
inevitable
as
vaccination
the
appendix
is
becoming
an
important
feature
in
the
book
of
life
he
once
told
peggy
gray
he
refused
to
go
to
a
hospital
but
pathetically
begged
to
be
taken
to
his
old
rooms
at
gray
with
all
the
unhappy
loneliness
of
a
sick
boy
he
craved
the
care
and
companionship
of
those
who
seemed
a
part
of
his
own
lotless
had
them
transform
a
small
bedchamber
into
a
model
operating
room
and
monty
took
no
small
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
if
he
was
to
be
denied
the
privilege
of
spending
money
for
several
weeks
he
would
at
least
make
his
illness
as
expensive
as
possible
a
consultation
of
eminent
surgeons
was
called
but
true
to
his
colors
brewster
installed
lotless
a
little
son
as
his
house
surgeon
monty
grimly
bore
the
pain
and
suffering
and
submitted
to
the
operation
which
alone
could
save
his
life
then
came
the
struggle
then
the
promise
of
victory
and
then
the
quiet
days
of
convalescence
in
the
little
room
where
he
had
dreamed
his
boyish
dreams
and
suffered
his
boyish
sorrows
he
struggled
against
death
and
gradually
emerged
from
the
mists
of
lassitude
he
found
it
harder
than
he
had
thought
to
come
back
to
life
the
burden
of
it
all
seemed
heavy
the
trained
nurses
found
that
some
more
powerful
stimulant
than
the
medicine
was
needed
to
awaken
his
ambition
and
they
discovered
it
at
last
in
peggy
child
he
said
to
her
the
first
time
she
was
permitted
to
see
him
and
his
eyes
had
lights
in
them
do
you
know
this
is
such
a
bad
old
world
after
all
sometimes
as
i
lain
here
it
has
looked
twisted
and
queer
but
there
are
things
that
straighten
it
out
i
feel
as
though
i
had
a
place
in
it
as
though
i
could
fight
things
and
win
out
what
do
you
think
peggy
do
you
suppose
there
is
something
that
i
could
do
you
know
what
i
mean
something
that
some
one
else
would
not
do
a
thousand
times
better
but
peggy
to
whom
this
chastened
mood
in
monty
was
infinitely
pathetic
would
not
let
him
talk
she
soothed
him
and
cheered
him
and
touched
his
hair
with
her
cool
hands
and
then
she
left
him
to
think
and
brood
and
dream
it
was
many
days
before
his
turbulent
mind
drifted
to
the
subject
of
money
but
suddenly
he
found
himself
hoping
that
the
surgeons
would
be
generous
with
their
charges
he
almost
suffered
a
relapse
when
lotless
visibly
distressed
informed
him
that
the
total
amount
would
reach
three
thousand
dollars
and
what
is
the
additional
charge
for
the
operation
asked
monty
unwilling
to
accept
such
unwarranted
favors
it
included
in
the
three
thousand
said
lotless
they
knew
you
were
my
friend
and
it
was
professional
etiquette
to
help
keep
down
expenses
for
days
brewster
remained
at
gray
happy
in
its
restfulness
serene
under
the
charm
of
peggy
presence
and
satisfied
to
be
hopelessly
behind
in
his
daily
expense
account
the
interest
shown
by
the
inquiries
at
the
house
and
the
anxiety
of
his
friends
were
soothing
to
the
profligate
it
gave
him
back
a
little
of
his
lost
the
doctors
finally
decided
that
he
would
best
recuperate
in
florida
and
advised
a
month
at
least
in
the
warmth
he
leaped
at
the
proposition
but
took
the
law
into
his
own
hands
by
ordering
general
manager
harrison
to
rent
a
place
and
insisting
that
he
needed
the
companionship
of
peggy
and
gray
how
soon
can
i
get
back
to
work
doctor
demanded
monty
the
day
before
the
special
train
was
to
carry
him
south
he
was
beginning
to
see
the
dark
side
of
this
enforced
idleness
his
blood
again
was
tingling
with
the
desire
to
be
back
in
the
harness
of
a
spendthrift
to
work
laughed
the
physician
and
what
is
your
occupation
pray
making
other
people
rich
responded
brewster
soberly
well
are
you
satisfied
with
what
you
have
done
for
me
if
you
are
as
charitable
as
that
you
must
be
still
pretty
sick
be
careful
and
you
may
be
on
your
feet
again
in
five
or
six
weeks
harrison
came
in
as
lotless
left
peggy
smiled
at
him
from
the
window
she
had
been
reading
aloud
from
a
novel
so
garrulous
that
it
fairly
cried
aloud
for
interruptions
now
nopper
what
became
of
the
ball
i
was
going
to
give
demanded
monty
a
troubled
look
in
his
eyes
why
we
called
it
off
said
nopper
in
surprise
do
you
remember
monty
asked
peggy
looking
up
quickly
and
wondering
if
his
mind
had
gone
trailing
off
i
know
we
did
give
it
of
course
but
what
date
did
you
hit
upon
we
did
postpone
it
at
all
said
nopper
how
could
we
we
know
whether
i
mean
it
would
have
been
quite
right
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
i
understand
well
what
has
become
of
the
orchestra
and
the
flowers
and
all
that
the
orchestra
is
gallivanting
around
the
country
quarreling
with
itself
and
everybody
else
and
driving
poor
gardner
to
the
insane
asylum
the
flowers
have
lost
their
bloom
long
ago
well
we
get
together
nopper
and
try
to
have
the
ball
at
i
think
i
be
well
by
that
time
peggy
looked
appealingly
at
harrison
for
guidance
but
to
him
silence
seemed
the
better
part
of
valor
and
he
went
off
wondering
if
the
illness
had
completely
carried
away
monty
reason
chapter
xvi
in
the
sunny
south
it
was
the
cottage
of
a
new
york
millionaire
which
had
fallen
to
brewster
the
owner
had
for
the
time
preferred
italy
to
augustine
and
left
his
estate
which
was
well
located
and
lavishly
equipped
in
the
hands
of
his
friends
brewster
lease
covered
three
months
at
a
fabulous
rate
per
month
with
joe
bragdon
installed
as
his
establishment
was
transferred
bodily
from
new
york
and
the
rooms
were
soon
as
comfortable
as
their
grandeur
would
permit
brewster
was
not
allowed
to
take
advantage
of
his
horses
and
the
new
automobile
which
preceded
him
from
new
york
but
to
his
guests
they
offered
unlimited
opportunities
nopper
harrison
had
remained
in
the
north
to
renew
arrangements
for
the
now
hated
ball
and
to
look
after
the
advance
details
of
the
yacht
cruise
lotless
and
his
sister
with
subway
smith
and
the
grays
made
up
brewster
party
lotless
dampened
monty
spirits
by
relentlessly
putting
him
on
rigid
diet
with
most
discouraging
restrictions
upon
his
conduct
the
period
of
convalescence
was
to
be
an
exceedingly
trying
one
for
the
invalid
at
first
he
was
kept
and
the
hours
were
whiled
away
by
playing
cards
but
monty
considered
bridge
the
pons
asinorum
and
preferred
to
play
piquet
with
peggy
it
was
one
of
these
games
that
the
girl
interrupted
with
a
question
that
had
troubled
her
for
many
days
monty
she
said
and
she
found
it
much
more
difficult
than
when
she
had
rehearsed
the
scene
in
the
silence
of
her
walks
i
heard
a
rumor
that
miss
drew
and
her
mother
have
taken
rooms
at
the
hotel
would
it
be
pleasanter
to
have
them
here
a
heavy
gloom
settled
upon
brewster
face
and
the
girl
heart
dropped
like
lead
she
had
puzzled
over
the
estrangement
and
wondered
if
by
any
effort
of
her
own
things
could
be
set
right
at
times
she
had
had
flashing
hopes
that
it
did
not
mean
as
much
to
monty
as
she
had
thought
but
down
underneath
the
fear
that
he
was
unhappy
seemed
the
only
certain
thing
in
life
she
felt
that
she
must
make
sure
and
together
with
the
very
human
desire
to
know
the
worst
was
the
puritanical
impulse
to
bring
it
about
you
forget
that
this
is
the
last
place
they
would
care
to
invade
and
in
brewster
face
peggy
seemed
to
read
that
for
her
martyrdom
was
the
only
wear
bravely
she
put
it
on
monty
i
forget
nothing
that
i
really
know
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
are
quite
wrong
where
is
your
sporting
blood
you
have
never
fought
a
losing
fight
before
and
you
ca
do
it
now
you
have
lost
your
nerve
monty
do
you
see
that
this
is
the
time
for
an
aggressive
campaign
somehow
she
was
not
saying
things
at
all
as
she
had
planned
to
say
them
and
his
gloom
weighed
heavily
upon
her
you
do
mind
do
you
monty
she
added
more
softly
this
sort
of
thing
from
me
i
know
i
ought
not
to
interfere
but
i
known
you
so
long
and
i
hate
to
see
things
twisted
by
a
very
little
mistake
but
monty
did
mind
enormously
he
had
no
desire
to
talk
about
the
thing
anyway
and
peggy
anxiety
to
marry
him
off
seemed
a
bit
unnecessary
manifestly
her
own
interest
in
him
was
of
the
coldest
from
out
of
the
gloom
he
looked
at
her
somewhat
sullenly
for
the
moment
she
was
thinking
only
of
his
pain
and
her
face
said
nothing
peggy
he
exclaimed
finally
resenting
the
necessity
of
answering
her
you
do
in
the
least
know
what
you
are
talking
about
it
is
not
a
fit
of
anger
on
barbara
drew
part
it
is
a
serious
conviction
a
conviction
which
can
be
changed
the
girl
broke
in
not
at
all
brewster
took
it
up
she
has
no
faith
in
me
she
thinks
i
an
ass
perhaps
she
right
she
exclaimed
a
little
hot
perhaps
you
have
never
discovered
that
girls
say
many
things
to
hide
their
emotions
perhaps
you
do
realize
what
feverish
exclamatory
foolish
things
girls
are
they
do
know
how
to
be
honest
with
the
men
they
love
and
they
would
if
they
did
you
are
little
short
of
an
idiot
monty
brewster
if
you
believed
the
things
she
said
rather
than
the
things
she
looked
and
peggy
fiery
and
determined
and
defiantly
unhappy
threw
down
her
cards
and
escaped
so
that
she
might
not
prove
herself
tearfully
feminine
she
left
brewster
still
heavily
enveloped
in
melancholy
but
she
left
him
puzzled
he
began
to
wonder
if
barbara
drew
did
have
something
in
the
back
of
her
mind
then
he
found
his
thoughts
wandering
off
toward
peggy
and
her
defiance
he
had
only
twice
before
seen
her
in
that
mood
and
he
liked
it
he
remembered
how
she
had
lost
her
temper
once
when
she
was
fifteen
and
hated
a
girl
he
admired
suddenly
he
laughed
aloud
at
the
thought
of
the
fierce
little
picture
she
had
made
and
the
gloom
which
had
been
so
sedulously
cultivated
was
dissipated
in
a
moment
the
laugh
surprised
the
man
who
brought
in
some
letters
one
of
them
was
from
nopper
harrison
and
gave
him
all
the
private
news
the
ball
was
to
be
given
at
which
arrived
toward
the
end
of
march
and
negotiations
were
well
under
way
for
the
chartering
of
the
flitter
the
belonging
to
reginald
brown
late
of
brown
brown
the
letter
made
brewster
chafe
under
the
bonds
of
inaction
his
affairs
were
getting
into
a
discouraging
state
the
illness
was
certain
to
entail
a
loss
of
more
than
to
his
business
his
only
consolation
came
through
harrison
synopsis
of
the
reports
from
gardner
who
was
managing
the
brief
american
tour
of
the
viennese
orchestra
quarrels
and
dissensions
were
becoming
embarrassments
and
the
venture
was
an
utter
failure
from
a
financial
point
of
view
broken
contracts
and
lawsuits
were
turning
the
tour
into
one
continuous
round
of
losses
and
poor
gardner
was
on
the
point
of
despair
from
the
beginning
apparently
the
concerts
had
been
marked
for
disaster
public
indifference
had
aroused
the
scorn
of
the
irascible
members
of
the
orchestra
and
there
was
imminent
danger
of
a
collapse
in
the
organization
gardner
lived
in
constant
fear
that
his
troop
of
quarrelsome
hungarians
would
finish
their
tour
suddenly
in
a
pitched
battle
with
daggers
and
steins
brewster
smiled
at
the
thought
of
practical
gardner
trying
to
smooth
down
the
electric
emotions
of
these
musicians
a
few
days
later
prentiss
drew
and
miss
drew
registered
at
the
ponce
de
leon
and
there
was
much
speculation
upon
the
chances
for
a
reconciliation
monty
however
maintained
a
strict
silence
on
the
subject
and
refused
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
his
friends
drew
had
brought
down
a
small
crowd
including
two
pretty
kentucky
girls
and
a
young
chicago
millionaire
she
lived
well
and
sensibly
with
none
of
the
extravagance
that
characterized
the
cottage
yet
it
was
inevitable
that
brewster
guests
should
see
hers
and
join
some
of
their
riding
parties
monty
pleaded
that
he
was
not
well
enough
to
be
in
these
excursions
but
neither
he
nor
barbara
cared
to
their
estrangement
peggy
gray
was
in
despair
over
monty
attitude
she
had
become
convinced
that
behind
his
pride
he
was
cherishing
a
secret
longing
for
barbara
yet
she
could
not
see
how
the
walls
were
to
be
broken
down
if
he
maintained
this
icy
reserve
she
was
sure
that
the
masterful
tone
was
the
one
to
win
with
a
girl
like
that
but
evidently
monty
would
not
accept
advice
that
he
was
mistaken
about
barbara
feeling
she
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
and
she
saw
things
going
hopelessly
wrong
for
want
of
a
word
there
were
times
when
she
let
herself
dream
of
possibilities
but
they
always
ended
by
seeming
too
impossible
she
cared
too
much
to
make
the
attainment
of
her
vision
seem
simple
she
cared
too
much
to
be
sure
of
anything
at
moments
she
fancied
that
she
might
say
a
word
to
miss
drew
which
would
straighten
things
out
but
there
was
something
about
her
which
held
her
off
even
now
that
they
were
thrown
together
more
or
less
she
could
not
get
beyond
a
certain
barrier
it
was
not
until
a
sunny
day
when
she
had
accepted
barbara
invitation
to
drive
that
things
seemed
to
go
more
easily
for
the
first
time
she
felt
the
charm
of
the
girl
and
for
the
first
time
barbara
seemed
unreservedly
friendly
it
was
a
quiet
drive
they
were
taking
through
the
woods
and
out
along
the
beach
and
somehow
in
the
open
air
things
simplified
themselves
finally
in
the
softness
and
the
idle
warmth
even
an
allusion
to
monty
whose
name
usually
meant
an
embarrassing
change
of
subject
began
to
seem
possible
it
was
inevitable
that
peggy
should
bring
it
in
for
with
her
a
question
of
tact
was
never
allowed
to
dominate
when
things
of
moment
were
at
stake
she
cowered
before
the
plunge
but
she
took
it
unafraid
the
doctor
says
monty
may
go
out
driving
she
began
that
fine
barbara
only
response
was
to
touch
her
pony
a
little
too
sharply
with
the
whip
peggy
went
on
as
if
unconscious
of
the
challenge
he
has
been
bored
to
death
poor
fellow
in
the
house
all
this
time
and
miss
gray
please
do
not
mention
brewster
name
to
me
again
interrupted
barbara
with
a
contraction
of
the
eyebrows
but
peggy
was
seized
with
a
spirit
of
defiance
and
plunged
recklessly
on
what
is
the
use
miss
drew
of
taking
an
attitude
like
that
i
know
the
situation
pretty
well
and
i
ca
believe
that
either
monty
or
you
has
lost
in
a
week
a
feeling
that
was
so
i
know
monty
much
too
well
to
think
that
he
would
change
so
easily
peggy
still
lived
largely
in
her
ideals
and
you
are
too
fine
a
thing
not
to
have
suffered
under
this
misunderstanding
it
seems
as
if
a
very
small
word
would
set
you
both
straight
barbara
drew
herself
up
and
kept
her
eyes
on
the
road
which
lay
white
and
gleaming
in
the
sun
i
have
not
the
least
desire
to
be
set
straight
and
she
was
never
more
serious
but
it
was
only
a
few
weeks
ago
that
you
were
engaged
i
am
sorry
answered
barbara
that
it
should
have
been
talked
about
so
much
brewster
did
ask
me
to
marry
him
but
i
never
accepted
in
fact
it
was
only
his
persistence
that
made
me
consider
the
matter
at
all
i
did
think
about
it
i
confess
that
i
rather
liked
him
but
it
was
not
long
before
i
found
him
out
what
do
you
mean
and
there
was
a
flash
in
peggy
eyes
what
has
he
done
to
my
certain
knowledge
he
has
spent
more
than
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
since
last
september
that
is
something
is
it
not
miss
drew
said
in
her
slow
cool
voice
and
even
peggy
loyalty
admitted
some
justification
in
the
criticism
generosity
has
ceased
to
be
a
virtue
then
she
asked
coldly
generosity
exclaimed
barbara
sharply
it
sheer
idiocy
you
heard
the
things
people
are
saying
they
are
calling
him
a
fool
and
in
the
clubs
they
are
betting
that
he
will
be
a
pauper
within
a
year
yet
they
charitably
help
him
to
spend
his
money
and
i
have
noticed
that
even
worldly
mammas
find
him
eligible
the
comment
was
not
without
its
caustic
side
that
was
months
ago
my
dear
protested
barbara
calmly
when
he
spoke
to
me
he
told
me
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
marry
within
a
year
and
do
you
see
that
a
year
may
make
him
an
abject
beggar
naturally
anything
is
preferable
to
a
beggar
came
in
peggy
clear
soft
voice
barbara
hesitated
only
a
moment
well
you
must
admit
miss
gray
that
it
shows
a
shameful
lack
of
character
how
could
any
girl
be
happy
with
a
man
like
that
and
after
all
one
must
look
out
for
one
own
fate
undoubtedly
replied
peggy
but
many
thoughts
were
dashing
through
her
brain
shall
we
turn
back
to
the
cottage
she
said
after
an
awkward
silence
you
certainly
do
approve
of
brewster
conduct
barbara
did
not
like
to
be
placed
in
the
wrong
and
felt
that
she
must
endeavor
to
justify
herself
he
is
the
most
reckless
of
we
know
and
he
probably
indulges
in
even
less
respectable
excitement
peggy
was
not
tall
but
she
carried
her
head
at
this
moment
as
though
she
were
in
the
habit
of
looking
down
on
the
world
are
you
going
a
little
too
far
miss
drew
she
asked
placidly
it
is
not
only
new
york
that
laughs
at
his
quixotic
transactions
barbara
persisted
hampton
our
guest
from
chicago
says
the
stories
are
worse
out
there
than
they
are
in
the
east
it
is
a
pity
that
monty
illness
should
have
made
him
so
weak
said
peggy
quietly
as
they
turned
in
through
the
great
iron
gates
and
barbara
was
not
slow
to
see
the
point
chapter
xvii
the
new
tenderfoot
brewster
was
comparatively
well
and
strong
when
he
returned
to
new
york
in
march
his
illness
had
interfered
extensively
with
his
plan
of
campaign
and
it
was
imperative
that
he
redouble
his
efforts
notwithstanding
the
manifest
dismay
of
his
friends
his
first
act
was
to
call
upon
grant
ripley
from
whom
he
hoped
to
learn
what
swearengen
jones
thought
of
his
methods
the
lawyers
had
heard
no
complaint
from
montana
and
advised
him
to
continue
as
he
had
begun
assuring
him
as
far
as
they
could
that
jones
would
not
prove
unreasonable
an
exchange
of
telegrams
just
before
his
operation
had
renewed
dread
of
his
eccentric
mentor
new
york

how
about
having
my
life
insured
would
it
violate
conditions
montgomery
brewster
to
montgomery
brewster
new
york
seems
to
me
your
life
would
become
an
asset
in
that
case
can
you
dispose
of
it
before
september
jones
to
swearengen
jones
butte
mont
on
the
contrary
i
think
life
will
be
a
debt
by
that
time
montgomery
brewster
to
montgomery
brewster
new
york
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
i
advise
you
to
take
out
a
policy
jones
to
swearengen
jones
butte
mont
do
you
think
that
amount
would
cover
funeral
expenses
montgomery
brewster
to
montgomery
brewster
new
york
you
wo
be
caring
about
expenses
if
it
comes
to
that
jones
the
invitations
for
the
second
ball
had
been
out
for
some
time
and
the
preparations
were
nearly
complete
when
brewster
arrived
upon
the
scene
of
festivity
it
did
not
surprise
him
that
several
friends
should
hunt
him
up
and
protest
vigorously
against
the
course
he
was
pursuing
nor
did
it
surprise
him
when
he
found
that
his
presence
was
not
as
essential
to
the
success
of
some
other
affair
as
it
had
once
been
he
was
not
greeted
as
cordially
as
before
and
he
grimly
wondered
how
many
of
his
friends
would
stand
true
to
the
end
the
uncertainty
made
him
turn
more
and
more
often
to
the
unquestioned
loyalty
of
peggy
gray
and
her
little
library
saw
him
more
frequently
than
for
months
much
as
he
had
dreaded
the
pretentious
and
resplendent
ball
it
was
useful
to
him
in
one
way
at
least
the
profit
side
of
his
ledger
account
was
enlarged
and
in
that
there
was
room
for
secret
satisfaction
the
viennese
orchestra
straggled
into
new
york
headed
by
elon
gardner
a
physical
wreck
in
time
to
make
a
harmonious
farewell
appearance
behind
brewster
palms
which
caused
his
guests
to
wonder
why
the
american
public
could
not
appreciate
the
real
thing
a
careful
summing
up
of
the
expenses
and
receipts
proved
that
the
tour
had
been
a
bonanza
for
brewster
the
net
loss
was
a
trifle
more
than
when
this
story
became
known
about
town
everybody
laughed
pityingly
and
poor
gardner
was
almost
in
tears
when
he
tried
to
explain
the
disaster
to
the
man
who
lost
the
money
but
monty
sense
of
humor
singularly
enough
did
not
desert
him
on
this
trying
occasion
aesthetically
the
ball
proved
to
be
the
talk
of
more
than
one
season
pettingill
had
justified
his
desire
for
authority
and
made
a
name
which
would
last
he
had
taken
matters
into
his
own
hands
while
brewster
was
in
florida
and
changed
the
period
from
the
spain
of
velasquez
to
france
and
louis
quinze
after
the
cards
were
out
he
remembered
to
his
consternation
that
the
favors
purchased
for
the
spanish
ball
would
be
entirely
inappropriate
for
the
french
one
he
wired
brewster
at
once
of
this
misfortune
and
was
astonished
at
the
nonchalance
of
his
reply
but
then
monty
always
was
a
good
sort
he
thought
with
a
glow
of
affection
the
new
plan
was
more
costly
than
the
old
for
it
was
no
simple
matter
to
build
a
versailles
suite
at
sherry
pettingill
was
no
imitator
but
he
created
an
effect
which
was
superbly
in
keeping
with
the
period
he
had
chosen
against
it
the
rich
costumes
with
their
accompaniment
of
wigs
and
powdered
hair
shone
out
resplendent
with
great
difficulty
the
artist
had
secured
for
monty
a
costume
in
white
satin
and
gold
brocade
which
might
once
have
adorned
the
person
of
louis
himself
it
made
him
feel
like
a
popinjay
and
it
was
with
infinite
relief
that
he
took
it
off
an
hour
or
so
after
dawn
he
knew
that
things
had
gone
well
that
even
dan
was
satisfied
but
the
whole
affair
made
him
heartsick
behind
the
compliments
lavished
upon
him
he
detected
a
note
of
irony
which
revealed
the
laughter
that
went
on
behind
his
back
he
had
not
realized
how
much
it
would
hurt
for
two
cents
he
thought
i
give
up
the
game
and
be
satisfied
with
what
left
but
he
reflected
that
such
a
course
would
offer
no
chance
to
redeem
himself
once
again
he
took
up
the
challenge
and
determined
to
win
out
then
he
thought
exultantly
i
make
them
feel
this
a
bit
he
longed
for
the
time
when
he
could
take
his
few
friends
with
him
and
sail
away
to
the
mediterranean
to
escape
the
eyes
and
tongues
of
new
york
impatiently
he
urged
harrison
to
complete
the
arrangements
so
that
they
could
start
at
once
but
harrison
face
was
not
untroubled
when
he
made
his
report
all
the
preliminary
details
had
been
perfected
he
had
taken
the
flitter
for
four
months
and
it
was
being
overhauled
and
put
into
condition
for
the
voyage
it
had
been
special
pride
but
at
his
death
it
went
to
heirs
who
were
ready
and
eager
to
rent
it
to
the
highest
bidder
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
find
a
handsomer
yacht
in
new
york
waters
a
picked
crew
of
fifty
men
were
under
command
of
captain
abner
perry
the
steward
was
a
famous
manager
and
could
be
relied
upon
to
stock
the
larder
in
princely
fashion
the
boat
would
be
in
readiness
to
sail
by
the
tenth
of
april
i
think
you
are
going
in
too
heavily
monty
protested
harrison
twisting
his
fingers
nervously
i
ca
for
my
life
figure
how
you
can
get
out
for
less
than
a
fortune
if
we
do
everything
you
have
in
mind
would
it
be
better
to
pull
up
a
bit
this
looks
like
sheer
madness
you
wo
have
a
dollar
monty
honestly
you
wo
it
not
in
me
to
save
money
nopper
but
if
you
can
pull
out
a
few
dollars
for
yourself
i
shall
not
object
you
told
me
that
once
before
monty
said
harrison
as
he
walked
to
the
window
when
he
resolutely
turned
back
again
to
brewster
his
face
was
white
but
there
was
a
look
of
determination
around
the
mouth
monty
i
got
to
give
up
this
job
he
said
huskily
brewster
looked
up
quickly
what
do
you
mean
nopper
i
got
to
leave
that
all
said
harrison
standing
stiff
and
straight
and
looking
over
brewster
head
good
lord
nopper
i
ca
have
that
you
must
not
desert
the
ship
what
the
matter
old
chap
you
as
white
as
a
ghost
what
is
it
monty
was
standing
now
and
his
hands
were
on
harrison
shoulders
but
before
the
intensity
of
his
look
his
friend
eyes
fell
helplessly
the
truth
is
monty
i
taken
some
of
your
money
and
i
lost
it
that
the
reason
i
i
ca
stay
on
i
have
betrayed
your
confidence
tell
me
about
it
and
monty
was
perhaps
more
uncomfortable
than
his
friend
i
do
understand
you
believed
too
much
in
me
monty
you
see
i
thought
i
was
doing
you
a
favor
you
were
spending
so
much
and
getting
nothing
in
return
and
i
thought
i
saw
a
chance
to
help
you
out
it
went
wrong
that
all
and
before
i
could
let
go
of
the
stock
sixty
thousand
dollars
of
your
money
had
gone
i
ca
replace
it
yet
but
god
knows
i
did
mean
to
steal
it
all
right
nopper
i
see
that
you
thought
you
were
helping
me
the
money
gone
and
that
ends
it
do
take
it
so
hard
old
boy
i
knew
you
act
this
way
but
it
does
help
matters
some
day
i
may
be
able
to
pay
back
the
money
i
took
and
i
going
to
work
until
i
do
brewster
protested
that
he
had
no
use
for
the
money
and
begged
him
to
retain
the
position
of
trust
he
had
held
but
harrison
had
too
much
to
care
to
be
confronted
daily
with
the
man
he
had
wronged
gradually
monty
realized
that
nopper
was
pursuing
the
most
manly
course
open
to
him
and
gave
up
the
effort
to
dissuade
him
he
insisted
upon
leaving
new
york
as
there
was
no
opportunity
to
redeem
himself
in
the
metropolis
i
made
up
my
mind
monty
to
go
out
west
up
in
the
mountains
perhaps
there
no
telling
i
may
stumble
on
a
gold
mine
up
there
and
well
that
seems
to
be
the
only
chance
i
have
to
restore
what
i
have
taken
from
you
by
jove
nopper
i
have
it
cried
monty
if
you
must
go
i
stake
you
in
the
hunt
for
gold
in
the
end
nopper
consented
to
follow
brewster
advice
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
share
equally
all
that
resulted
from
his
prospecting
tour
brewster
him
for
a
year
and
before
the
end
of
the
week
a
new
tenderfoot
was
on
his
way
to
the
rocky
mountains
chapter
xviii
the
prodigal
at
sea
harrison
departure
left
brewster
in
sore
straits
it
forced
him
to
settle
down
to
the
actual
management
of
his
own
affairs
he
was
not
indolent
but
this
was
not
the
kind
of
work
he
cared
to
encourage
the
private
accounts
he
had
kept
revealed
some
appalling
facts
when
he
went
over
them
carefully
one
morning
at
four
after
an
session
with
the
ledger
with
infinite
pains
he
had
managed
to
rise
to
something
over
in
six
months
but
to
his
original
million
it
had
been
necessary
to
add
which
he
had
realized
from
lumber
and
fuel
and
some
of
his
other
unfortunate
operations
at
least
would
come
to
him
ultimately
through
the
sale
of
furniture
and
other
belongings
and
then
there
would
be
something
like
interest
to
consider
but
luck
had
aided
him
in
getting
rid
of
his
money
the
bank
failure
had
cost
him
and
nopper
harrison
had
helped
him
to
the
extent
of
the
reckless
but
determined
effort
to
give
a
ball
had
cost
what
he
had
lost
during
his
illness
had
been
pretty
well
offset
by
the
unlucky
concert
tour
the
florida
trip
including
medical
attention
the
cottage
and
living
expenses
had
entailed
the
expenditure
of
and
his
princely
dinners
and
theater
parties
had
footed
up
taking
all
the
facts
into
consideration
he
felt
that
he
had
done
rather
well
as
far
as
he
had
gone
but
the
hardest
part
of
the
undertaking
was
yet
to
come
he
was
still
in
possession
of
an
enormous
sum
which
must
disappear
before
september
about
had
already
been
expended
in
the
yachting
project
he
determined
to
begin
at
once
a
systematic
campaign
of
extinction
it
had
been
his
intention
before
sailing
to
dispose
of
many
household
articles
either
by
sale
or
gift
as
he
did
not
expect
to
return
to
new
york
before
the
latter
part
of
august
this
would
minimize
the
struggles
of
the
last
month
but
the
prospective
profit
to
be
acquired
from
keeping
his
apartment
open
was
not
to
be
overlooked
he
could
easily
count
upon
a
generous
sum
for
salaries
and
running
expenses
once
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
he
hoped
that
new
opportunities
for
extravagance
would
present
themselves
and
he
fancied
he
could
leave
the
final
settlement
of
his
affairs
for
the
last
month
as
the
day
for
sailing
approached
the
world
again
seemed
bright
to
this
most
mercenary
of
spendthrifts
a
farewell
consultation
with
his
attorneys
proved
encouraging
for
to
them
his
chances
to
win
the
extraordinary
contest
seemed
of
the
best
he
was
in
high
spirits
as
he
left
them
exhilarated
by
the
sensation
that
the
world
lay
before
him
in
the
elevator
he
encountered
colonel
prentiss
drew
on
both
sides
the
meeting
was
not
without
its
difficulties
the
colonel
had
been
dazed
by
the
inexplicable
situation
between
monty
and
his
daughter
whose
involutions
he
found
hard
to
understand
her
summary
of
the
effort
she
had
made
to
effect
a
reconciliation
after
hearing
the
story
of
the
bank
was
rather
vague
she
had
done
her
utmost
she
said
to
be
nice
to
him
and
make
him
feel
that
she
appreciated
his
generosity
but
he
took
it
in
the
most
disagreeable
fashion
colonel
drew
knew
that
things
were
somehow
wrong
but
he
was
too
strongly
an
american
father
to
interfere
in
a
matter
of
the
affections
it
distressed
him
for
he
had
a
liking
for
monty
and
barbara
society
judgments
as
he
called
them
had
no
weight
with
him
when
he
found
himself
confronted
with
brewster
in
the
elevator
the
old
warmth
revived
and
the
old
hope
that
the
quarrel
might
have
an
end
his
greeting
was
cheery
you
have
not
forgotten
brewster
he
said
as
they
shook
hands
that
you
have
a
dollar
or
two
with
us
no
said
monty
not
exactly
and
i
shall
be
calling
upon
you
for
some
of
it
very
soon
i
off
on
thursday
for
a
cruise
in
the
mediterranean
i
heard
something
of
it
they
had
reached
the
main
floor
and
colonel
drew
had
drawn
his
companion
out
of
the
crowd
into
the
rotunda
the
money
is
at
your
disposal
at
any
moment
but
are
you
setting
a
pretty
lively
pace
my
boy
you
know
i
always
liked
you
and
i
knew
your
grandfather
rather
well
he
was
a
good
old
chap
monty
and
he
would
hate
to
see
you
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
his
fortune
there
was
something
in
the
colonel
manner
that
softened
brewster
much
as
he
hated
to
take
a
reproof
from
barbara
father
once
again
he
was
tempted
to
tell
the
truth
but
he
pulled
himself
up
in
time
a
funny
old
world
colonel
he
said
and
sometimes
one
nearest
friend
is
a
stranger
i
know
i
seem
a
fool
but
after
all
why
it
good
philosophy
to
make
the
most
of
a
holiday
and
then
settle
back
to
work
that
is
all
very
well
monty
and
colonel
drew
was
entirely
serious
but
the
work
is
a
hundred
times
harder
after
you
have
played
to
the
limit
you
find
that
you
are
way
beyond
it
it
no
joke
getting
back
into
the
harness
perhaps
you
are
right
colonel
but
at
least
i
shall
have
something
to
look
back
upon
even
if
the
worst
comes
and
monty
instinctively
straightened
his
shoulders
they
turned
to
leave
the
building
and
the
colonel
had
a
moment
of
weakness
do
you
know
monty
he
said
my
daughter
is
awfully
cut
up
about
this
business
she
is
plucky
and
tries
not
to
show
it
but
after
all
a
girl
does
get
over
that
sort
of
thing
all
in
a
moment
i
am
not
saying
it
seemed
necessary
to
recede
a
step
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
patch
up
but
i
like
you
monty
and
if
any
man
could
do
it
you
can
colonel
i
wish
i
might
and
brewster
found
that
he
did
not
hesitate
for
your
sake
i
very
much
wish
the
situation
were
as
simple
as
it
seems
but
there
are
some
things
a
man
ca
forget
and
well
barbara
has
shown
in
a
dozen
ways
that
she
has
no
faith
in
me
well
i
got
faith
in
you
and
a
lot
of
it
take
care
of
yourself
and
when
you
get
back
you
can
count
on
me
on
thursday
morning
the
flitter
steamed
off
down
the
bay
and
the
flight
of
the
prodigal
was
on
no
swifter
cleaner
handsomer
boat
ever
sailed
out
of
the
harbor
of
new
york
and
it
was
a
merry
crowd
that
she
carried
out
to
sea
brewster
guests
numbered
and
they
brought
with
them
a
liberal
supply
of
maids
valets
and
luggage
it
was
not
until
many
weeks
later
that
he
read
the
vivid
descriptions
of
the
weighing
of
the
anchor
which
were
printed
in
the
new
york
papers
but
by
that
time
he
was
impervious
to
their
ridicule
on
deck
watching
the
rugged
silhouette
of
the
city
disappear
into
the
mists
were
dan
demille
and
dan
peggy
gray
rip
van
winkle
reginald
vanderpool
joe
bragdon
lotless
and
his
sister
isabel
and
valentine
the
official
chaperon
and
their
daughter
mary
subway
smith
paul
pettingill
and
some
others
hardly
less
distinguished
as
monty
looked
over
the
eager
crowd
he
recognized
with
a
peculiar
glow
that
here
were
represented
his
best
and
truest
friendships
the
loyalty
of
these
companions
had
been
tested
and
he
knew
that
they
would
stand
by
him
through
everything
there
was
no
little
surprise
when
it
was
learned
that
dan
demille
was
ready
to
sail
many
of
the
idle
voyagers
ventured
the
opinion
that
he
would
try
to
desert
the
boat
in
if
he
saw
a
chance
to
get
back
to
his
club
on
a
steamer
but
demille
big
indolent
and
indifferent
smiled
carelessly
and
hoped
he
would
bother
anybody
if
he
stuck
to
the
ship
until
the
end
for
a
time
the
sea
and
the
sky
and
the
talk
of
the
crowd
were
enough
for
the
joy
of
living
but
after
a
few
peaceful
days
there
was
a
lull
and
it
was
then
that
monty
gained
the
nickname
of
aladdin
which
clung
to
him
from
somewhere
from
the
hold
or
the
rigging
or
from
under
the
sea
he
brought
forth
four
darkies
from
the
south
who
strummed
guitars
and
sang
ragtime
melodies
more
than
once
during
the
voyage
they
were
useful
peggy
said
brewster
one
day
when
the
sky
was
particularly
clear
and
things
were
quiet
on
deck
on
the
whole
i
prefer
this
to
crossing
the
north
river
on
a
ferry
i
rather
like
it
do
you
it
seems
like
a
dream
she
cried
her
eyes
bright
her
hair
blowing
in
the
wind
and
peggy
do
you
know
what
i
tucked
away
in
a
chest
down
in
my
cabin
a
lot
of
books
that
you
like
some
from
the
old
garret
saved
them
to
read
on
rainy
days
peggy
did
not
speak
but
the
blood
began
to
creep
into
her
face
and
she
looked
wistfully
across
the
water
then
she
smiled
i
did
know
you
could
save
anything
she
said
weakly
come
now
peggy
that
is
too
much
i
did
mean
to
hurt
you
but
you
must
not
forget
monty
that
there
are
other
years
to
follow
this
one
do
you
know
what
i
mean
peggy
dear
please
do
lecture
me
he
begged
so
piteously
that
she
could
not
be
serious
the
class
is
dismissed
for
monty
she
said
airily
but
the
professor
knows
his
duty
and
wo
let
you
off
so
easily
next
time
chapter
xix
one
hero
and
another
at
gibraltar
monty
was
handed
an
cablegram
which
he
opened
tremblingly
to
montgomery
brewster
private
yacht
flitter
gibraltar
there
is
an
agitation
to
declare
for
free
silver
you
may
have
twice
as
much
to
spend
hooray
jones
to
which
monty
responded
defeat
the
measure
at
any
cost
the
more
the
merrier
and
charge
it
to
me
brewster
please
send
many
cables
and
mark
them
collect
the
riviera
season
was
fast
closing
and
the
possibilities
suggested
by
monte
carlo
were
too
alluring
to
the
host
to
admit
of
a
long
stop
at
gibraltar
but
the
demilles
had
letters
to
one
of
the
officers
of
the
garrison
and
brewster
could
not
overlook
the
opportunity
to
give
an
elaborate
dinner
the
success
of
the
affair
may
best
be
judged
by
the
fact
that
the
flitter
larder
required
an
entirely
new
stock
the
next
day
the
officers
and
ladies
of
the
garrison
were
asked
and
monty
would
have
entertained
the
entire
regiment
with
beer
and
sandwiches
if
his
friends
had
not
interfered
it
might
cement
the
alliance
argued
gardner
but
your
pocketbook
needs
cementing
a
bit
more
yet
the
pocketbook
was
very
wide
open
and
gardner
only
consolation
lay
in
a
tall
english
girl
whom
he
took
out
to
dinner
for
the
others
there
were
many
compensations
as
the
affair
was
brilliant
and
the
new
element
a
pleasant
relief
from
the
inevitable
monotony
it
was
after
the
guests
had
gone
ashore
that
monty
discovered
and
dan
holding
a
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
i
am
sorry
to
break
this
up
he
interrupted
but
as
the
only
conscientious
chaperon
in
the
party
i
must
warn
you
that
your
behavior
is
already
being
talked
about
the
idea
of
a
sedate
old
married
couple
sitting
out
here
alone
watching
the
moon
it
shocking
i
yield
to
the
host
said
dan
mockingly
but
i
shall
be
consumed
with
jealousy
until
you
restore
her
to
me
monty
noticed
the
look
in
dan
eyes
as
she
watched
her
husband
go
and
marked
a
new
note
in
her
voice
as
she
said
how
this
trip
is
bringing
him
out
he
has
just
discovered
monty
observed
that
the
club
is
not
the
only
place
in
the
world
it
a
funny
thing
she
answered
that
dan
should
have
been
so
misunderstood
do
you
know
that
he
relentlessly
conceals
his
best
side
down
underneath
he
is
the
kind
of
man
who
could
do
a
fine
thing
very
simply
my
dear
dan
you
surprise
me
it
looks
to
me
almost
as
though
you
had
fallen
in
love
with
dan
yourself
monty
she
said
sharply
you
are
as
blind
as
the
rest
have
you
never
seen
that
before
i
have
played
many
games
but
i
have
always
come
back
to
dan
through
them
all
i
have
known
that
he
was
the
only
thing
possible
to
me
the
only
thing
in
the
least
desirable
it
a
queer
muddle
that
one
should
be
tempted
to
play
with
fire
even
when
one
is
monotonously
happy
i
been
singed
once
or
twice
but
dan
is
a
dear
and
he
has
always
helped
me
out
of
a
tight
place
he
knows
no
one
understands
better
than
dan
and
perhaps
if
i
were
less
wickedly
human
he
would
not
care
for
me
so
much
monty
listened
at
first
in
a
sort
of
a
daze
for
he
had
unthinkingly
accepted
the
general
opinion
of
the
demille
situation
but
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
for
a
moment
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
convincing
it
came
to
him
with
unpleasant
distinctness
that
he
had
been
all
kinds
of
a
fool
looking
back
over
his
intercourse
with
her
he
realized
that
the
situation
had
been
clear
enough
all
the
time
how
little
we
know
our
friends
he
exclaimed
with
some
bitterness
and
a
moment
later
i
liked
you
a
great
deal
dan
for
a
long
time
but
well
i
am
jealous
of
dan
the
flitter
saw
some
rough
weather
in
making
the
trip
across
the
bay
of
lyons
she
was
heading
for
nice
when
an
incident
occurred
that
created
the
first
real
excitement
experienced
on
the
voyage
a
group
of
passengers
in
the
main
saloon
was
discussing
more
or
less
stealthily
monty
misdemeanors
when
reggy
vanderpool
sauntered
lazily
in
his
face
displaying
the
only
sign
of
interest
it
had
shown
in
days
funny
predicament
i
was
just
in
he
drawled
i
want
to
ask
what
a
fellow
should
have
done
under
the
circumstances
i
have
refused
the
girl
observed
rip
van
winkle
laconically
girl
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
old
chap
went
on
reggy
dropping
into
a
chair
fellow
fell
overboard
a
little
while
ago
he
went
on
calmly
there
was
a
chorus
of
cries
and
brewster
was
forgotten
for
a
time
one
of
the
sailors
you
know
he
was
doing
something
in
the
rigging
near
where
i
was
standing
puff
off
he
went
into
the
sea
and
there
he
was
puttering
around
in
the
water
oh
the
poor
fellow
cried
miss
valentine
i
never
set
eyes
on
him
before
perfect
stranger
i
would
have
hesitated
a
minute
but
the
deck
was
crowded
with
a
lot
of
his
friends
one
chap
was
his
bunkie
so
really
now
it
was
my
place
to
jump
in
after
him
he
could
swim
a
bit
and
i
yelled
to
him
to
hold
up
and
tell
the
captain
confounded
captain
was
to
be
found
though
somebody
said
he
was
asleep
in
the
end
i
told
the
mate
by
this
time
we
were
a
mile
away
from
the
place
where
he
went
overboard
and
i
told
the
mate
i
did
think
we
could
find
him
if
we
went
back
but
he
lowered
some
boats
and
they
put
back
fast
afterwards
i
got
to
thinking
about
the
matter
of
course
if
i
had
known
him
if
he
had
been
one
of
you
it
would
have
been
different
and
you
were
the
best
swimmer
in
college
you
miserable
rat
exploded
lotless
there
was
a
wild
rush
for
the
upper
deck
and
vanderpool
was
not
the
hero
of
the
hour
the
flitter
had
turned
and
was
steaming
back
over
her
course
two
small
boats
were
racing
to
the
place
where
unknown
had
gone
over
where
is
brewster
shouted
joe
bragdon
i
ca
find
him
sir
answered
the
first
mate
he
ought
to
know
of
this
cried
valentine
there
by
the
eternal
they
are
picking
somebody
up
over
yonder
exclaimed
the
mate
see
that
first
boat
has
laid
to
and
they
are
dragging
yes
sir
he
saved
a
cheer
went
up
on
board
and
the
men
in
the
small
boats
waved
their
caps
in
response
everybody
rushed
to
the
rail
as
the
flitter
drew
up
to
the
boats
and
there
was
intense
excitement
on
board
a
gasp
of
amazement
went
up
from
every
one
monty
brewster
drenched
but
smiling
sat
in
one
of
the
boats
and
leaning
limply
against
him
his
head
on
his
chest
was
the
sailor
who
had
fallen
overboard
brewster
had
seen
the
man
in
the
water
and
instead
of
wondering
what
his
antecedents
were
leaped
to
his
assistance
when
the
boat
reached
him
his
unconscious
burden
was
a
dead
weight
and
his
own
strength
was
almost
gone
another
minute
or
two
and
both
would
have
gone
to
the
bottom
as
they
hauled
monty
over
the
side
he
shivered
for
an
instant
grasped
the
first
little
hand
that
sought
his
so
frantically
and
then
turned
to
look
upon
the
sailor
find
out
the
boy
name
abertz
and
see
that
he
has
the
best
of
care
just
before
he
fainted
out
there
he
murmured
something
about
his
mother
he
was
thinking
of
himself
even
then
you
see
and
bragdon
this
in
a
lower
voice
will
you
see
that
his
wages
are
properly
increased
hello
peggy
look
out
you
get
wet
to
the
skin
if
you
do
that
chapter
xx
le
roi
if
montgomery
brewster
had
had
any
misgivings
about
his
ability
to
dispose
of
the
balance
of
his
fortune
they
were
dispelled
very
soon
after
his
party
landed
in
the
riviera
on
the
pretext
that
the
yacht
required
a
thorough
house
cleaning
brewster
transferred
his
guests
to
the
hotel
of
a
fascinating
village
which
was
near
the
sea
and
yet
quite
out
of
the
world
the
place
was
nearly
empty
at
the
time
and
the
proprietor
wept
tears
of
joy
when
monty
engaged
for
his
party
the
entire
first
floor
of
the
house
with
balconies
overlooking
the
blue
mediterranean
and
a
separate
and
salon
extra
servants
were
summoned
and
the
brewster
livery
was
soon
a
familiar
sight
about
the
village
the
protests
of
peggy
and
the
others
were
only
silenced
when
monty
threatened
to
rent
a
villa
and
go
to
housekeeping
the
town
quickly
took
on
the
appearance
of
entertaining
a
royal
visitor
and
a
number
of
shops
were
kept
open
longer
than
usual
in
the
hope
that
their
owners
might
catch
some
of
the
american
money
one
morning
philippe
the
hotel
proprietor
was
trying
to
impress
brewster
with
a
gesticulatory
description
of
the
glories
of
the
bataille
de
fleurs
it
seemed
quite
impossible
to
express
the
extent
of
his
regret
that
the
party
had
not
arrived
in
time
to
see
it
this
is
quite
another
place
at
that
time
he
said
ecstatically
magnifique
superbe
if
monsieur
had
only
seen
it
why
not
have
another
all
to
ourselves
asked
monty
but
the
suggestion
was
not
taken
seriously
nevertheless
the
young
american
and
his
host
were
in
secret
session
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
and
when
the
result
was
announced
at
luncheon
there
was
general
consternation
it
appeared
that
ten
days
later
occurred
the
fete
day
of
some
minor
saint
who
had
not
for
years
been
accorded
the
honor
of
a
celebration
monty
proposed
to
revive
the
custom
by
arranging
a
second
carnival
you
might
just
as
well
not
come
to
the
riviera
at
all
he
explained
if
you
ca
see
a
carnival
it
a
simple
matter
really
i
offer
one
price
for
the
best
decorated
carriage
and
another
to
the
handsomest
lady
then
every
one
puts
on
a
domino
and
a
mask
throws
confetti
at
every
one
else
and
there
you
are
i
suppose
you
will
have
the
confetti
made
of
thousand
franc
notes
and
offer
a
house
and
lot
as
a
prize
and
bragdon
feared
that
his
sarcasm
was
almost
insulting
really
monty
the
scheme
is
ridiculous
said
demille
the
police
wo
allow
it
wo
they
though
said
monty
exultantly
the
chief
happens
to
be
philippe
and
we
had
him
on
the
telephone
he
listen
to
the
scheme
until
we
agreed
to
make
him
grand
marshal
of
the
parade
then
he
promised
the
cooperation
of
the
entire
force
and
hoped
to
interest
his
colleague
the
chief
of
the
fire
department
the
parade
will
consist
of
two
gendarmes
and
the
brewster
party
in
carriages
laughed
dan
do
you
expect
us
to
go
before
or
after
the
bakery
carts
we
review
the
procession
from
the
hotel
said
monty
you
worry
about
the
fete
it
going
to
be
great
why
an
irishman
fonder
of
marching
than
these
people
are
of
having
a
carnival
the
men
in
the
party
went
into
executive
session
as
soon
as
monty
had
gone
to
interview
the
local
authorities
and
seriously
considered
taking
measures
to
subdue
their
host
eccentricities
but
the
humor
of
the
scheme
appealed
to
them
too
forcibly
and
almost
before
they
knew
it
they
were
making
plans
for
the
carnival
of
course
we
ca
let
him
do
it
but
it
would
be
sport
said
subway
smith
think
of
a
between
gendarmes
and
blanchiseuses
i
always
feel
devilish
the
moment
i
get
a
mask
on
said
vanderpool
and
you
know
by
jove
i
have
felt
that
way
for
years
that
settles
it
then
said
demille
monty
would
call
it
off
himself
if
he
knew
how
it
would
affect
reggie
monty
returned
with
the
announcement
that
the
mayor
of
the
town
would
declare
a
holiday
if
the
american
could
see
his
way
to
pay
for
the
repairs
on
the
mairie
roof
a
circus
which
was
traveling
in
the
neighborhood
was
guaranteed
expenses
if
it
would
stop
over
and
occupy
the
square
in
front
of
the
hotel
de
ville
brewster
enthusiasm
was
such
that
no
one
could
resist
helping
him
and
for
nearly
a
week
his
friends
were
occupied
in
superintending
the
erection
of
triumphal
arches
and
encouraging
the
shopkeepers
to
do
their
best
although
the
scheme
had
been
conceived
in
the
spirit
of
a
lark
it
was
not
so
received
by
the
townspeople
they
were
quite
serious
in
the
matter
the
railroad
officials
sent
advertisements
broadcast
and
the
local
cure
called
to
thank
brewster
for
resurrecting
as
it
were
the
obscure
saint
the
expression
of
his
gratitude
was
so
mingled
with
flattery
and
appeal
that
monty
could
not
overlook
the
hint
that
a
new
altar
piece
had
long
been
needed
the
great
day
finally
arrived
and
no
carnival
could
have
been
more
bizarre
or
more
successful
the
morning
was
devoted
to
athletics
and
the
side
shows
the
pompiers
won
the
tug
of
war
and
the
people
marveled
when
monty
duplicated
the
feats
of
the
strong
man
in
the
circus
demille
was
called
upon
for
a
speech
but
knowing
only
ten
words
of
french
he
graciously
retired
in
favor
of
the
mayor
and
that
pompous
little
man
made
the
most
of
a
rare
opportunity
references
to
franklin
and
lafayette
were
so
frequent
that
subway
smith
intimated
that
a
rubber
stamp
must
have
been
used
in
writing
the
address
the
parade
took
place
in
the
afternoon
and
proved
quite
the
feature
of
the
day
the
question
of
precedence
nearly
overturned
monty
plans
but
the
chief
of
police
was
finally
made
to
see
that
if
he
were
to
be
chief
marshal
it
was
only
fair
that
the
pompiers
should
march
ahead
of
the
gendarmes
the
crew
of
the
flitter
made
a
wonderful
showing
it
was
led
by
the
yacht
band
which
fairly
outdid
sousa
in
noise
though
it
was
less
unanimous
in
the
matter
of
time
all
the
fiacres
came
at
the
end
but
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
the
line
of
march
was
so
short
that
at
times
they
were
really
leading
the
processional
despite
the
gallant
efforts
of
the
grand
marshal
from
the
balcony
of
the
hotel
monty
and
his
party
pelted
those
below
with
flowers
and
confetti
more
allusions
to
franklin
and
lafayette
were
made
when
the
cure
and
the
mayor
halted
the
procession
and
presented
monty
with
an
address
richly
engrossed
on
imitation
parchment
then
the
school
children
sang
and
the
crowd
dispersed
to
meet
again
in
the
evening
at
eight
brewster
presided
over
a
large
banquet
and
numbered
among
his
guests
every
one
of
distinction
in
the
town
the
wives
were
also
invited
and
franklin
and
lafayette
were
again
alluded
to
each
of
the
men
made
at
least
one
speech
but
subway
smith
third
address
was
the
hit
of
the
evening
knowing
nothing
but
english
he
had
previously
clung
consistently
to
that
language
but
the
third
and
final
address
seemed
to
demand
something
more
friendly
and
genial
with
a
sweeping
bow
and
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
statesman
he
began
mesdames
et
messieurs
tu
as
il
a
nous
avons
with
a
magnificent
gesture
vous
avez
the
french
members
of
the
company
were
not
equal
to
his
pronunciation
and
were
under
the
impression
that
he
was
still
talking
english
they
were
profoundly
impressed
with
his
deference
and
grace
and
accorded
his
preamble
a
round
of
applause
the
americans
did
their
utmost
to
persuade
him
to
be
seated
but
their
uproar
was
mistaken
by
the
others
for
enthusiasm
and
the
applause
grew
louder
than
ever
subway
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
and
his
manner
suggested
that
he
was
about
to
utter
some
peculiarly
important
thought
he
waited
until
a
pin
fall
could
have
been
heard
before
he
went
on
maitre
corbeau
sur
un
arbre
perche
he
finished
the
speech
as
he
was
being
carried
bodily
from
the
room
by
demille
and
bragdon
the
frenchmen
then
imagined
that
smith
remarks
had
been
insulting
and
his
friends
had
silenced
him
on
that
account
a
riot
seemed
imminent
when
monty
succeeded
in
restoring
silence
and
with
a
few
tactful
remarks
about
franklin
and
lafayette
quieted
the
excited
guests
the
evening
ended
with
fireworks
and
a
dance
in
the
open
air
a
dance
that
grew
gay
under
the
masks
the
wheels
had
been
well
oiled
and
there
was
no
visible
failure
of
the
carnival
spirit
to
brewster
it
seemed
a
mad
game
and
he
found
it
less
easy
to
play
a
part
behind
the
foolish
mask
than
he
expected
his
own
friends
seemed
to
elude
him
and
the
coquetries
of
the
village
damsels
had
merely
a
fleeting
charm
he
was
standing
apart
to
watch
the
glimmering
crowd
when
he
was
startled
by
a
smothered
cry
turning
to
investigate
he
discovered
a
little
red
domino
unmistakably
frightened
and
trying
to
release
herself
from
a
too
ardent
punchinello
monty
arrival
prevented
him
from
tearing
off
the
girl
mask
and
gave
him
an
entirely
new
conception
of
the
strenuous
life
he
arose
fuming
and
sputtering
but
he
was
taken
in
hand
by
the
crowd
and
whirled
from
one
to
another
in
whimsical
mockery
meanwhile
monty
unconscious
that
his
mask
had
dropped
during
the
encounter
was
astonished
to
feel
the
little
hand
of
the
red
domino
on
his
arm
and
to
hear
a
voice
not
at
all
unfamiliar
in
his
ear
monty
you
are
a
dear
i
love
you
for
that
you
looked
like
a
greek
athlete
do
you
know
it
was
foolish
but
i
really
was
frightened
child
how
could
it
have
happened
he
whispered
leading
her
away
fancy
my
little
peggy
with
no
one
to
look
after
her
what
a
beast
i
was
to
trust
you
to
pettingill
i
might
have
known
the
chump
would
have
been
knocked
out
by
all
this
color
he
stopped
to
look
down
at
her
and
a
light
came
into
his
eyes
little
peggy
in
the
great
world
he
smiled
you
are
not
fit
you
need
well
you
need
just
me
but
valentine
had
seen
him
as
he
stood
revealed
and
came
up
in
search
of
peggy
it
was
almost
morning
she
told
her
and
quite
time
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
sleep
so
in
bragdon
charge
they
wandered
off
a
bit
reluctantly
a
bit
lingeringly
it
was
not
until
monty
was
summoned
to
rescue
reggie
vanderpool
from
the
stern
arm
of
the
law
that
he
discovered
the
identity
of
punchinello
manifestly
he
had
not
been
in
a
condition
to
recognize
his
assailant
and
a
subsequent
disagreement
had
driven
the
first
out
of
his
head
the
poor
boy
was
sadly
bruised
about
the
face
and
his
arrest
had
probably
saved
him
from
worse
punishment
i
told
you
i
could
wear
a
mask
he
explained
ruefully
as
monty
led
him
home
but
how
could
i
know
that
he
could
hear
me
all
the
time
the
day
after
the
carnival
brewster
drove
his
guests
over
to
monte
carlo
he
meant
to
stay
only
long
enough
to
try
his
luck
at
the
tables
and
lose
enough
to
make
up
for
the
days
at
sea
when
his
purse
was
necessarily
idle
swearengen
jones
was
forgotten
and
soon
after
his
arrival
he
began
to
plunge
at
first
he
lost
heavily
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
concealed
his
joy
peggy
gray
was
watching
him
and
in
whispers
implored
him
to
stop
but
dan
excitedly
urged
him
to
continue
until
the
luck
changed
to
the
girl
chagrin
it
was
the
more
reckless
advice
that
he
followed
in
so
desperate
a
situation
he
felt
that
he
could
not
stop
but
his
luck
turned
too
soon
i
ca
afford
to
give
up
he
said
miserably
to
himself
after
a
time
i
already
a
winner
by
five
thousand
dollars
and
i
must
at
least
get
rid
of
that
brewster
became
the
center
of
interest
to
those
who
were
not
playing
and
people
marveled
at
his
luck
they
quite
misunderstood
his
eagerness
and
the
flushed
anxious
look
with
which
he
followed
each
spin
of
the
wheel
he
had
chosen
a
seat
beside
an
english
duchess
whose
practice
it
was
to
appropriate
the
winnings
of
the
more
inexperienced
players
and
he
was
aware
that
many
of
his
gold
pieces
were
being
deliberately
stolen
here
he
thought
was
at
least
a
helping
hand
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
moving
his
stack
toward
her
side
when
demille
interfered
he
had
watched
the
duchess
and
had
called
the
croupier
attention
to
her
neat
little
method
but
that
austere
individual
silenced
him
by
saying
in
surprise
mais
madame
la
duchesse
que
not
to
be
downed
so
easily
demille
watched
the
play
from
behind
monty
chair
and
cautioned
his
friend
at
the
first
opportunity
better
cash
in
and
change
your
seat
monty
they
robbing
you
he
whispered
cash
in
when
i
away
ahead
of
the
game
never
and
monty
did
his
best
to
assume
a
joyful
tone
at
first
he
played
with
no
effort
at
system
piling
his
money
flat
on
the
numbers
which
seemed
to
have
least
chance
of
winning
but
he
simply
could
not
lose
then
he
tried
to
reverse
different
systems
he
had
heard
of
but
they
turned
out
to
be
winners
finally
in
desperation
he
began
doubling
on
one
color
in
the
hope
that
he
would
surely
lose
in
the
end
but
his
particular
fate
was
against
him
with
his
entire
stake
on
the
red
the
ball
continued
to
fall
into
the
red
holes
until
the
croupier
announced
that
the
bank
was
broken
dan
demille
gathered
in
the
money
and
counted
forty
thousand
dollars
before
he
handed
it
to
monty
his
friends
were
overjoyed
when
he
left
the
table
and
wondered
why
he
looked
so
downhearted
inwardly
he
berated
himself
for
not
taking
peggy
advice
i
so
glad
for
your
sake
that
you
did
not
stop
when
i
asked
you
monty
but
your
luck
does
not
change
my
belief
that
gambling
is
next
to
stealing
peggy
was
constrained
to
say
as
they
went
to
supper
i
wish
i
had
taken
your
advice
he
said
gloomily
and
missed
the
fortune
you
have
won
how
foolish
of
you
monty
you
were
a
loser
by
several
thousand
dollars
then
she
objected
with
whimsical
inconsistency
but
peggy
he
said
quietly
looking
deep
into
her
eyes
it
would
have
won
me
your
respect
chapter
xxi
fairyland
monty
situation
was
desperate
only
a
little
more
than
six
thousand
dollars
had
been
spent
on
the
carnival
and
no
opportunity
of
annihilating
the
roulette
winnings
seemed
to
offer
itself
his
experience
at
monte
carlo
did
not
encourage
him
to
try
again
and
peggy
attitude
toward
the
place
was
distinctly
antagonistic
the
riviera
presenting
no
new
opportunities
for
extravagance
it
became
necessary
to
seek
other
worlds
i
never
before
understood
the
real
meaning
of
the
phrase
money
thought
monty
lord
if
it
would
only
loosen
a
bit
and
stay
loosened
something
must
be
done
he
realized
to
earn
his
living
perhaps
the
role
of
the
princely
profligate
would
be
easier
in
italy
than
anywhere
else
he
studied
the
outlook
from
every
point
of
view
but
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
hopeless
baedeker
was
provokingly
barren
of
suggestions
for
extravagance
and
monty
grew
impatient
of
the
book
small
economies
noticing
some
chapters
on
the
italian
lakes
in
an
inspired
moment
he
remembered
that
pettingill
had
once
lost
his
heart
to
a
villa
on
the
lake
of
como
instantly
a
new
act
of
comedy
presented
itself
to
him
he
sought
out
pettingill
and
demanded
a
description
of
his
castle
in
the
air
oh
it
a
wonder
exclaimed
the
artist
and
his
eyes
grew
dreamy
it
shines
out
at
you
with
its
white
terraces
and
turrets
like
those
fascinating
castles
that
maxfield
parrish
draws
for
children
it
is
fairyland
you
expect
to
wake
and
find
it
gone
oh
drop
that
petty
said
brewster
or
it
will
make
you
poetical
what
i
want
to
know
is
who
owns
it
and
is
it
likely
to
be
occupied
at
this
season
it
belongs
to
a
certain
marquise
who
is
a
widow
with
no
children
they
say
she
has
a
horror
of
the
place
for
some
reason
and
has
never
been
near
it
it
is
kept
as
though
she
was
to
turn
up
the
next
day
but
except
for
the
servants
it
is
always
deserted
the
very
thing
declared
brewster
petty
we
have
a
you
better
not
count
on
that
monty
a
man
i
know
ran
across
the
place
once
and
tried
for
a
year
to
buy
it
but
the
lady
has
ideas
of
her
own
well
if
you
wish
to
give
him
a
hint
or
two
about
how
to
do
things
watch
me
if
you
do
spend
two
weeks
in
your
i
will
cut
the
crowd
and
sail
for
home
he
secured
the
name
of
the
owner
and
found
that
pettingill
had
even
a
remote
idea
of
the
address
of
her
agent
armed
with
these
facts
he
set
out
in
search
of
a
courier
and
through
philippe
he
secured
a
frenchman
named
bertier
who
was
guaranteed
to
be
surprisingly
ingenious
in
providing
methods
of
spending
money
to
him
brewster
confided
his
scheme
and
bertier
realized
with
rising
enthusiasm
that
at
last
he
had
secured
a
client
after
his
own
heart
he
was
able
to
complete
the
address
of
the
agent
of
the
mysterious
marquise
and
an
inquiry
was
immediately
telegraphed
to
him
the
agent
reply
would
have
been
discouraging
to
any
one
but
brewster
it
stated
that
the
owner
had
no
intention
of
leasing
her
forsaken
castle
for
any
period
whatever
the
profligate
learned
that
a
fair
price
for
an
estate
of
that
kind
for
a
month
was
ten
thousand
francs
and
he
wired
an
offer
of
five
times
that
sum
for
two
weeks
the
agent
replied
that
some
delay
would
be
necessary
while
he
communicated
with
his
principal
delay
was
the
one
word
that
brewster
did
not
understand
so
he
wired
him
an
address
in
genoa
and
the
flitter
was
made
ready
for
sea
steam
had
been
kept
up
and
her
coal
account
would
compare
favorably
with
that
of
an
ocean
liner
philippe
was
breathless
with
joy
when
he
was
paid
in
advance
for
another
month
at
the
hotel
on
the
assumption
that
the
party
might
be
moved
to
return
at
any
moment
the
little
town
was
gay
at
parting
and
brewster
and
his
guests
were
given
a
royal
farewell
at
genoa
the
mail
had
accumulated
and
held
the
attention
of
the
yacht
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
brewster
was
somewhat
crestfallen
to
learn
that
the
lady
of
the
villa
haughtily
refused
his
princely
offer
he
won
the
devotion
of
his
courier
by
promptly
increasing
it
to
one
hundred
thousand
francs
when
this
too
met
with
rejection
there
was
a
pause
and
a
serious
consultation
between
the
two
bertier
exclaimed
brewster
i
must
have
the
thing
now
what
to
be
done
you
got
to
help
me
out
but
the
courier
prodigal
as
he
was
of
gestures
had
no
words
which
seemed
pertinent
there
must
be
some
way
of
getting
at
this
marquise
monty
continued
reflectively
what
are
her
tastes
do
you
know
anything
about
her
suddenly
the
face
of
the
courier
grew
bright
i
have
it
he
said
and
then
he
faltered
but
the
expense
monsieur
it
would
be
heavy
perhaps
we
can
meet
it
suggested
monty
quietly
what
the
idea
it
was
explained
with
plenty
of
action
to
make
it
clear
the
courier
had
heard
in
florence
that
madame
la
marquise
had
a
passion
for
automobiles
but
with
her
inadequate
fortune
and
the
many
demands
upon
it
it
was
a
weakness
not
readily
gratified
the
machine
she
had
used
during
the
winter
was
by
no
means
possibly
if
monsieur
yet
it
was
too
much
no
villa
but
brewster
decision
was
made
wire
the
fellow
he
said
that
i
will
add
to
my
last
offer
a
french
machine
of
the
latest
model
and
the
best
make
say
too
that
i
would
like
immediate
possession
he
secured
it
and
the
crowd
was
transferred
at
once
to
fairyland
there
were
protests
of
course
but
these
brewster
had
grown
to
expect
and
he
was
learning
to
carry
things
with
a
high
hand
the
travelers
had
been
preceded
by
bertier
and
the
greeting
they
received
from
the
steward
of
the
estate
and
his
innumerable
assistants
was
very
italian
and
full
of
color
a
break
in
their
monotony
was
welcome
the
loveliness
of
the
villa
and
its
grounds
which
sloped
down
to
the
gentle
lake
silenced
criticism
for
a
time
it
was
supremely
satisfying
to
do
nothing
pettingill
wandered
about
as
though
he
could
not
believe
it
was
real
he
was
lost
in
a
kind
of
atmosphere
of
ecstasy
to
the
others
who
took
it
more
calmly
it
was
still
a
sort
of
paradise
those
who
were
happy
found
in
it
an
intensification
of
happiness
and
to
those
who
were
sad
it
offered
the
tenderest
opportunities
for
melancholy
dan
told
brewster
that
only
a
poet
could
have
had
this
inspiration
and
peggy
added
anything
after
this
would
be
an
really
monty
you
would
better
take
us
home
i
feel
like
the
boy
who
was
shut
in
a
closet
for
punishment
and
found
it
the
place
where
they
kept
the
jam
said
subway
it
is
almost
as
good
as
owning
central
park
the
stables
were
well
equipped
and
the
days
wore
on
in
a
wonderful
peace
it
was
on
a
radiant
afternoon
when
twelve
of
the
crowd
had
started
out
after
tea
for
a
long
ride
toward
lugano
that
monty
determined
to
call
peggy
gray
to
account
he
was
certain
that
she
had
deliberately
avoided
him
for
days
and
weeks
and
he
could
find
no
reason
for
it
hour
after
hour
he
had
lain
awake
wondering
where
he
had
failed
her
but
the
conclusion
of
one
moment
was
rejected
the
next
the
monte
carlo
episode
seemed
the
most
plausible
cause
yet
even
before
that
he
had
noticed
that
whenever
he
approached
her
she
managed
to
be
talking
with
some
one
else
two
or
three
times
he
was
sure
she
had
seen
his
intention
before
she
took
refuge
with
dan
or
mary
valentine
or
pettingill
the
thought
of
the
last
name
gave
monty
a
sudden
thrill
what
if
it
were
he
who
had
come
between
them
it
troubled
him
but
there
were
moments
when
the
idea
seemed
impossible
as
they
mounted
and
started
off
the
exhilaration
of
the
ride
made
him
hopeful
they
were
to
have
dinner
in
the
open
air
in
the
shadow
of
an
abbey
ruin
some
miles
away
and
the
servants
had
been
sent
ahead
to
prepare
it
it
went
well
and
with
dan
help
the
dinner
was
made
gay
on
the
return
monty
who
was
off
last
spurred
up
his
horse
to
join
peggy
she
seemed
eager
to
be
with
the
rest
and
he
lost
no
time
with
a
preamble
do
you
know
peggy
he
began
something
seems
to
be
wrong
and
i
am
wondering
what
it
is
why
what
do
you
mean
monty
as
he
paused
every
time
i
come
near
you
child
you
seem
to
have
something
else
to
do
if
i
join
the
group
you
are
in
it
is
the
signal
for
you
to
break
away
nonsense
monty
why
should
i
avoid
you
we
have
known
one
another
much
too
long
for
that
but
he
thought
he
detected
some
contradiction
in
her
eyes
and
he
was
right
the
girl
was
afraid
of
him
afraid
of
the
sensations
he
awoke
afraid
desperately
of
betrayal
pettingill
may
appeal
to
you
he
said
and
his
voice
was
serious
but
you
might
at
least
be
courteous
to
me
how
absurd
you
are
monty
brewster
the
girl
grew
hot
you
think
that
your
million
gives
you
the
privilege
of
dictating
to
all
of
your
guests
peggy
how
can
you
he
interjected
she
went
on
ruthlessly
if
my
conduct
interferes
with
your
pleasure
i
can
easily
join
the
prestons
in
paris
suddenly
brewster
remembered
that
pettingill
had
spoken
of
the
prestons
and
expressed
a
fleeting
wish
that
he
might
be
with
them
in
the
latin
quarter
with
pettingill
to
follow
i
suppose
he
said
icily
it
would
certainly
give
you
more
privacy
and
dan
more
opportunities
she
retorted
as
he
dropped
back
toward
the
others
the
artist
instantly
took
his
place
the
next
moment
he
had
challenged
her
to
a
race
and
they
were
flying
down
the
road
in
the
moonlight
brewster
not
to
be
outdone
was
after
them
but
it
was
only
a
moment
before
his
horse
shied
violently
at
something
black
in
the
road
then
he
saw
peggy
horse
galloping
riderless
instantly
with
fear
at
his
throat
he
had
dismounted
and
was
at
the
girl
side
she
was
not
hurt
they
found
only
bruised
and
dazed
and
somewhat
lamed
a
girth
had
broken
and
her
saddle
turned
the
crowd
waited
silent
and
somewhat
awed
until
the
carriage
with
the
servants
came
up
and
she
was
put
into
it
dan
maid
was
there
and
peggy
insisted
that
she
would
have
no
one
else
but
as
monty
helped
her
in
he
had
whispered
you
wo
go
child
will
you
how
could
things
go
on
here
chapter
xxii
prince
and
peasants
the
peacefulness
of
fairyland
was
something
which
brewster
could
not
afford
to
continue
and
with
bertier
he
was
soon
planning
to
invade
it
the
automobile
which
he
was
obliged
to
order
for
the
mysterious
marquise
put
other
ideas
into
his
head
it
seemed
at
once
absolutely
necessary
to
give
a
coaching
party
in
italy
and
as
coaches
of
the
right
kind
were
hard
to
find
there
and
changes
of
horses
most
uncertain
nothing
could
be
more
simple
and
natural
than
to
import
automobiles
from
paris
looking
into
the
matter
he
found
that
they
would
have
to
be
purchased
outright
as
the
renting
of
five
machines
would
put
his
credit
to
too
severe
a
test
accordingly
bertier
telegraphed
a
wholesale
order
which
taxed
the
resources
of
the
manufacturers
and
caused
much
complaint
from
some
customers
whose
work
was
unaccountably
delayed
the
arrangement
made
by
the
courier
was
that
they
were
to
be
taken
back
at
a
greatly
reduced
price
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
the
machines
were
shipped
at
once
five
to
milan
and
one
to
the
address
of
the
mysterious
marquise
in
florence
it
was
with
a
sharp
regret
that
monty
broke
into
the
idyl
of
the
villa
for
the
witchery
of
the
place
had
got
into
his
blood
but
a
stern
sense
of
duty
combined
with
the
fact
that
the
paris
chauffeurs
and
machines
were
due
in
milan
on
monday
made
him
ruthless
he
was
astonished
that
his
orders
to
decamp
were
so
meekly
obeyed
forgetting
that
his
solicitous
guests
did
not
know
that
worse
extravagance
lay
beyond
he
took
them
to
milan
by
train
and
lodged
them
with
some
splendor
at
the
hotel
cavour
here
he
found
that
the
fame
of
the
princely
profligate
had
preceded
him
and
his
portly
host
was
all
deference
and
attention
all
regret
too
for
monsieur
was
just
too
late
to
hear
the
wonderful
company
of
artists
who
had
been
singing
at
la
scala
the
season
was
but
just
ended
here
was
an
opportunity
missed
indeed
and
vexation
brought
out
an
ironical
comment
to
bertier
it
rankled
but
it
had
its
effect
the
courier
proved
equal
to
the
emergency
discovering
that
the
manager
of
the
company
and
the
principal
artists
were
still
in
milan
he
suggested
to
brewster
that
a
special
performance
would
be
very
difficult
to
secure
but
might
still
be
possible
his
chief
caught
at
the
idea
and
authorized
him
to
make
every
arrangement
reserving
the
entire
house
for
his
own
party
but
the
place
will
look
bare
protested
the
courier
aghast
fill
it
with
flowers
cover
it
with
tapestries
commanded
brewster
i
put
the
affair
in
your
hands
and
i
trust
you
to
carry
it
through
in
the
right
way
show
them
how
it
ought
to
be
done
bertier
heart
swelled
within
him
at
the
thought
of
so
glorious
an
opportunity
his
fame
he
felt
was
already
established
in
italy
it
became
a
matter
of
pride
to
do
the
thing
handsomely
and
the
necessary
business
arrangements
called
out
all
his
unused
resources
of
delicacy
and
diplomacy
when
it
came
to
the
decoration
of
the
opera
house
he
called
upon
pettingill
for
assistance
and
together
they
superintended
an
arrangement
which
curtained
off
a
large
part
of
the
place
and
reduced
it
to
livable
proportions
with
the
flowers
and
the
lights
the
tapestries
and
the
great
faded
flags
it
became
something
quite
different
from
the
usual
empty
theater
to
the
consternation
of
the
italians
the
work
had
been
rushed
and
it
was
on
the
evening
after
their
arrival
in
milan
that
brewster
conducted
his
friends
in
state
to
the
scala
it
was
almost
a
triumphal
progress
for
he
had
generously
if
unwittingly
given
the
town
the
most
princely
sensation
in
years
and
curiosity
was
abundant
valentine
who
was
in
the
carriage
with
monty
wondered
openly
why
they
were
attracting
so
much
attention
they
take
us
for
american
dukes
and
princesses
explained
monty
they
never
saw
a
white
man
before
perhaps
they
expected
us
to
ride

protested
i
seem
to
see

in
their
faces
they
are
looking
for

i
wonder
exclaimed
dan
if
they
do
get
tired
now
and
then
of
being
potentates
ca
you
fancy
living
in
palaces
and
longing
for
a
thatched
cottage
easily
answered
subway
with
a
laugh
have
we
tried
it
ourselves
two
months
of
living
upon
nothing
but
fatted

more
than
i
can
stand
we
shall
be
ready
for
a
home
for

if
you
ca
slow
down
a
bit
monty
whereupon
dan
evolved
a
plan
and
promptly
began
to
carry
it
out
by
inviting
the
crowd
to
dinner
the
next
night
monty
protested
that
they
would
be
leaving
milan
in
the
afternoon
and
that
this
was
distinctly
his
affair
and
he
was
selfish
but
dan
was
very
sure
my
dear
boy
you
ca
have
things
your
own
way
every
minute
in
another
month
you
will
be
quite
spoiled
anything
to
prevent
that
my
duty
is
plain
even
if
i
have
to
use
heroic
measures
you
dine
with
me
monty
recognized
defeat
when
he
met
it
and
graciously
accepted
her
very
kind
invitation
the
next
moment
they
drew
up
at
the
opera
house
and
were
ushered
in
with
a
deference
accorded
only
to
wealth
the
splendor
of
the
effect
was
overpowering
to
brewster
as
well
as
to
his
bewildered
guests
aladdin
it
seemed
had
fairly
outdone
himself
the
wonder
of
it
was
so
complete
that
it
was
some
time
before
they
could
settle
down
to
the
opera
which
was
aida
given
with
an
enthusiasm
that
only
italians
can
compass
during
the
last
intermission
brewster
and
peggy
were
walking
in
the
foyer
they
had
rarely
spoken
since
the
day
of
the
ride
but
monty
noticed
with
happiness
that
she
had
on
several
occasions
avoided
pettingill
i
thought
we
had
given
up
fairyland
when
we
left
the
lakes
but
i
believe
you
carry
it
with
you
she
said
the
trouble
with
this
monty
replied
is
that
there
are
too
many
people
about
my
fairyland
is
to
be
just
a
little
different
your
fairyland
monty
will
be
built
of
gold
and
paved
with
silver
you
will
sit
all
day
cutting
coupons
in
an
office
of
alabaster
peggy
do
you
too
think
me
vulgar
it
a
beastly
parade
i
know
but
it
ca
stop
now
you
do
realize
the
momentum
of
the
thing
you
do
it
up
to
the
handle
she
put
in
and
you
are
much
too
generous
to
be
vulgar
but
it
worries
me
monty
it
worries
me
desperately
it
the
future
i
thinking
of
your
future
which
is
being
swallowed
up
this
kind
of
thing
ca
go
on
and
what
is
to
follow
it
you
are
wasting
your
substance
and
you
are
not
making
any
life
for
yourself
that
opens
out
peggy
he
answered
very
seriously
you
have
got
to
trust
me
i
back
out
but
i
tell
you
this
you
shall
not
be
disappointed
in
me
in
the
end
there
was
a
mist
before
the
girl
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
i
believe
you
monty
she
said
simply
i
shall
not
forget
the
curtain
rose
upon
the
next
act
and
something
in
the
opera
toward
the
end
seemed
to
bring
the
two
very
close
together
as
they
were
leaving
the
theater
there
was
a
note
of
regret
from
peggy
it
has
been
perfect
she
breathed
yet
monty
is
it
a
waste
that
no
one
else
should
have
seen
it
think
of
these
peasants
who
adore
music
and
have
never
heard
an
opera
well
they
shall
hear
one
now
monty
rose
to
it
but
he
felt
like
a
hypocrite
in
concealing
his
chief
motive
we
repeat
the
performance
night
and
fill
the
house
with
them
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
bertier
was
given
a
task
the
next
day
which
was
not
to
his
taste
but
with
the
assistance
of
the
city
authorities
he
carried
it
through
to
them
it
was
an
evidence
of
insanity
but
there
was
something
princely
about
it
and
they
were
tolerant
the
manager
of
the
opera
house
was
less
complacent
and
he
had
an
exclamatory
terror
of
the
damage
to
his
upholstery
but
brewster
had
discovered
that
in
italy
gold
is
a
panacea
for
all
ills
and
his
prescriptions
were
liberal
to
him
the
day
was
short
for
interest
in
the
penance
as
it
came
to
be
called
was
so
keen
that
she
insisted
on
having
a
hand
in
the
preliminaries
there
was
something
about
the
partnership
that
appealed
to
monty
to
her
regret
the
demille
dinner
interfered
with
the
opening
of
the
performance
but
monty
consoled
her
with
the
promise
that
the
opera
and
its
democratic
audience
should
follow
during
the
day
dan
had
been
deep
in
preparations
for
her
banquet
but
her
plans
were
elaborately
concealed
they
culminated
at
eight
in
the
cova
not
far
from
the
scala
and
the
dinner
was
eaten
in
the
garden
to
the
sound
of
music
yet
it
was
an
effect
of
simplicity
with
which
dan
surprised
her
guests
they
were
prepared
for
anything
but
that
and
when
they
were
served
with
consomme
spaghetti
a
concession
to
the
chef
and
chops
and
peas
followed
by
a
salad
and
coffee
the
gratitude
of
the
crowd
was
quite
beyond
expression
in
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
subway
smith
suggested
a
testimonial
monty
complained
bitterly
that
he
himself
had
never
received
a
ghost
of
a
testimonial
he
protested
that
it
was
not
deserved
why
should
you
expect
it
exclaimed
pettingill
when
you
have
risen
from
terrapin
and
artichokes
to
chops
and
chicory
when
have
you
given
us
nectar
and
ambrosia
like
this
monty
was
defeated
by
a
unanimous
vote
and
dan
testimonial
was
assured
this
matter
settled
peggy
and
valentine
with
brewster
and
pettingill
walked
over
to
the
scala
and
heard
again
the
last
two
acts
of
aida
but
the
audience
was
different
and
the
applause
the
next
day
at
noon
the
chauffeurs
from
paris
reported
for
duty
and
five
gleaming
french
steamed
off
through
the
crowd
in
the
direction
of
venice
through
brescia
and
verona
and
vicenza
they
passed
scattering
largess
of
silver
in
their
wake
and
leaving
a
trail
of
breathless
wonder
brewster
found
the
pace
too
fast
and
by
the
time
they
reached
venice
he
had
a
wistful
longing
to
take
this
radiant
country
more
slowly
but
this
is
purely
a
business
trip
he
thought
and
i
ca
expect
to
enjoy
it
some
day
i
come
back
and
do
it
differently
i
could
spend
hours
in
a
gondola
if
the
blamed
things
were
not
more
expensive
by
the
trip
it
was
there
that
he
was
suddenly
recalled
to
his
duty
from
dreams
of
moonlight
on
the
water
by
a
cablegram
which
demanded
before
it
could
be
read
it
contained
word
for
word
the
parable
of
the
ten
talents
and
ended
with
the
simple
word

chapter

an
offer
of
marriage
the
summer
is
scarcely
a
good
time
to
visit
egypt
but
monty
and
his
guests
had
a
desire
to
see
even
a
little
of
the
northern
coast
of
africa
it
was
decided
therefore
that
after
athens
the
flitter
should
go
south
the
yacht
had
met
them
at
naples
after
the
automobile
procession
a
kind
of
triumphal
progress
was
disbanded
in
florence
and
they
had
taken
a
hurried
survey
of
rome
by
the
middle
of
july
the
party
was
leaving
the
heat
of
egypt
and
finding
it
not
half
bad
new
york
was
not
more
than
a
month
away
as
brewster
reckoned
time
and
distance
and
there
was
still
too
much
money
in
the
treasury
as
september
drew
nearer
he
got
into
the
habit
of
frequently
forgetting
swearengen
jones
until
it
was
too
late
to
retrace
his
steps
he
was
coming
to
the
death
struggle
as
he
termed
it
and
there
was
something
rather
terrorizing
in
the
fear
that
the
million
might
die
hard
and
so
these
last
days
and
nights
were
glorious
ones
if
one
could
have
looked
at
them
with
unbiased
untroubled
eyes
but
every
member
of
his
party
was
praying
for
the
day
when
the
flitter
would
be
well
into
the
broad
atlantic
and
the
worst
over
at
alexandria
brewster
had
letters
to
some
englishmen
and
in
the
few
entertainments
that
he
gave
succeeded
once
again
in
fairly
outdoing
aladdin
a
sheik
from
the
interior
was
a
guest
at
one
of
monty
entertainments
he
was
a
burly
fellow
with
a
harem
and
he
had
been
invited
more
as
a
curiosity
than
as
one
to
be
honored
as
he
came
aboard
the
flitter
monty
believed
the
invitation
was
more
than
justified
mohammed
was
superb
and
the
women
of
the
party
made
so
much
of
him
that
it
was
small
wonder
that
his
head
was
turned
he
fell
desperately
in
love
with
peggy
gray
on
sight
and
with
all
the
composure
of
a
potentate
who
had
never
been
crossed
he
sent
for
brewster
the
next
day
and
told
him
to
send
her
around
and
he
would
marry
her
monty
blood
boiled
furiously
for
a
minute
or
two
but
he
was
quick
to
see
the
wisdom
of
treating
the
proposition
diplomatically
he
tried
to
make
it
plain
to
the
sheik
that
miss
gray
could
not
accept
the
honor
he
wished
to
confer
upon
her
but
it
was
not
custom
to
be
denied
anything
he
asked
for
especially
anything
feminine
he
complacently
announced
that
he
would
come
aboard
that
afternoon
and
talk
it
over
with
peggy
brewster
looked
the
swarthy
gentleman
over
with
unconcealed
disgust
in
his
eyes
the
mere
thought
of
this
ugly
brute
so
much
as
touching
the
hand
of
little
peggy
gray
filled
him
with
horror
and
yet
there
was
something
laughable
in
the
situation
he
could
not
hide
the
smile
that
came
with
the
mind
picture
of
peggy
listening
to
the
avowal
of
the
sheik
the
arab
misinterpreted
this
exhibition
of
mirth
to
him
the
grin
indicated
friendship
and
encouragement
he
wanted
to
give
brewster
a
ring
as
a
pledge
of
affection
but
the
american
declined
the
offering
and
also
refused
to
carry
a
bag
of
jewels
to
peggy
i
let
the
old
boy
come
aboard
just
to
see
peggy
look
a
hole
through
him
he
resolved
no
matter
how
obnoxious
it
may
be
it
is
every
girl
who
can
say
an
oriental
potentate
has
asked
her
to
marry
him
if
this
gets
disagreeable
we
may
tumble
him
into
the
sea
for
a
change
with
the
best
grace
possible
he
invited
the
sheik
to
come
aboard
and
consult
miss
gray
in
person
mohammed
was
a
good
bit
puzzled
over
the
intimation
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
plead
for
anything
he
had
expressed
a
desire
to
possess
brewster
confided
the
news
to
rip
van
winkle
and
subway
smith
who
had
gone
ashore
with
him
and
the
trio
agreed
that
it
would
be
good
sport
to
let
the
royal
proposal
come
as
a
surprise
to
peggy
van
winkle
returned
to
the
yacht
at
once
but
his
companions
stayed
ashore
to
do
some
shopping
when
they
approached
the
flitter
later
on
they
observed
an
unusual
commotion
on
deck
mohammed
had
not
tarried
long
after
their
departure
he
gathered
his
train
together
selected
a
few
costly
presents
that
had
been
returned
from
the
harem
and
advanced
on
the
boat
without
delay
the
captain
of
the
flitter
stared
long
and
hard
at
the
gaily
bedecked
launches
and
then
called
to
his
first
officer
together
they
watched
the
ceremonious
approach
a
couple
of
heralds
came
aboard
first
and
announced
the
approach
of
the
mighty
chief
captain
perry
went
forward
to
greet
the
sheik
as
he
came
over
the
side
of
the
ship
but
he
was
brushed
aside
by
the
advance
guards
half
a
hundred
swarthy
fellows
crowded
aboard
and
then
came
the
sheik
the
personification
of
pomp
and
pride
where
is
she
he
asked
in
his
native
tongue
the
passengers
were
by
this
time
aware
of
the
visitation
and
began
to
straggle
on
deck
filled
with
curiosity
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
coming
aboard
in
this
manner
demanded
the
now
irate
captain
perry
shoving
a
couple
of
retainers
out
of
his
path
and
facing
the
beaming
suitor
an
interpreter
took
a
hand
at
this
juncture
and
the
doughty
captain
finally
was
made
to
understand
the
object
of
the
visit
he
laughed
in
the
sheik
face
and
told
the
mate
to
call
up
a
few
jackies
to
drive
the
dagoes
off
rip
van
winkle
interfered
and
peace
was
restored
the
cruise
had
changed
rip
into
a
happier
and
far
more
radiant
creature
so
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
have
shared
the
secret
with
mary
valentine
he
had
told
the
story
of
the
sheik
demand
to
her
as
soon
as
he
came
aboard
and
she
had
divulged
it
to
peggy
the
instant
rip
was
out
of
sight
brewster
found
the
sheik
sitting
in
state
on
the
upper
deck
impatiently
awaiting
the
appearance
of
his
charmer
he
did
not
know
her
name
but
he
had
tranquilly
commanded
rip
to
produce
all
of
the
women
on
board
so
that
he
might
select
peggy
from
among
them
van
winkle
and
bragdon
who
now
was
in
the
secret
were
preparing
to
march
the
ladies
past
the
ruler
when
monty
came
up
has
he
seen
peggy
he
asked
of
van
winkle
not
yet
she
is
dressing
for
the
occasion
well
wait
and
see
what
happens
to
him
when
she
gets
over
the
first
shock
laughed
monty
just
then
the
sheik
discovered
peggy
who
pretty
as
a
picture
drew
near
the
strange
group
to
her
amazement
two
slaves
rushed
forward
and
obstructed
her
passage
long
enough
to
beat
their
heads
on
the
deck
a
few
times
after
which
they
arose
and
tendered
two
magnificent
necklaces
she
was
prepared
for
the
proposal
but
this
action
disconcerted
her
she
gasped
and
looked
about
in
perplexity
her
friends
were
smiling
broadly
and
the
sheik
had
placed
his
hands
over
his
palpitating
heart
lothario
has
a
pain
whispered
rip
van
winkle
sympathetically
and
brewster
laughed
peggy
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
after
hearing
the
laugh
she
walked
straight
toward
the
sheik
her
cheeks
were
pink
and
her
eyes
were
flashing
dangerously
the
persistent
brown
slaves
followed
with
the
jewels
but
she
ignored
them
completely
brave
as
she
intended
to
be
she
could
not
repress
the
shudder
of
repulsion
that
went
over
her
as
she
looked
full
upon
this
eager
arab
graceful
and
slender
she
stood
before
the
burly
mohammed
but
his
ardor
was
not
cooled
by
the
presence
of
so
many
witnesses
with
a
thud
he
dropped
to
his
knees
wabbling
for
a
moment
in
the
successful
effort
to
maintain
a
poetic
equilibrium
then
he
began
pouring
forth
volumes
of
shattered
french
english
and
arabic
sentiment
accompanied
by
facial
contortions
so
intense
that
they
were
little
less
than
gruesome
oh
joy
of
the
sun
supreme
jewel
of
the
only
eye
hearken
to
the
entreaty
of
mohammed
it
was
more
as
if
he
were
commanding
his
troops
in
battle
than
pleading
for
the
tender
compassion
of
a
lady
love
i
am
come
for
you
queen
of
the
sea
and
earth
and
sky
my
boats
are
here
my
camels
there
and
mohammed
promises
you
a
palace
in
the
hills
if
you
will
but
let
him
bask
forever
in
the
glory
of
your
smile
all
this
was
uttered
in
a
mixture
of
tongues
so
atrocious
that
subway
smith
afterward
described
it
as
a
salad
the
retinue
bowed
impressively
and
two
or
three
graceless
americans
applauded
as
vigorously
as
if
they
were
approving
the
actions
of
a
comic
opera
chorus
sailors
were
hanging
in
the
rigging
on
the
davits
and
over
the
deck
house
roof
smile
for
the
gentleman
peggy
commanded
brewster
delightedly
he
wants
to
take
a
short
bask
you
are
very
rude
brewster
said
peggy
turning
upon
him
coldly
then
to
the
waiting
expectant
sheik
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
eloquence
mohammed
looked
bewildered
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
the
interpreter
who
cleared
up
the
mystery
surrounding
her
english
for
the
next
three
or
four
minutes
the
air
was
filled
with
the
jewels
of
africa
star
sunlight
queen
heavenly
joy
pearl
of
the
desert
and
other
things
in
bad
english
worse
french
and
perfect
arabic
he
was
making
promises
that
could
not
be
redeemed
if
he
lived
a
thousand
years
in
conclusion
the
gallant
sheik
drew
a
long
breath
screwed
his
face
into
a
simpering
grin
and
played
his
trump
card
in
unmistakable
english
it
sounded
pathetically
like
you
a
peach
an
indecorous
roar
went
up
from
the
white
spectators
and
a
jacky
in
the
rigging
suddenly
thinking
of
home
piped
up
with
a
bar
or
two
from
the
star
spangled
banner
having
accomplished
what
he
considered
to
be
his
part
of
the
ceremony
the
sheik
arose
and
started
toward
his
launch
coolly
motioning
for
her
to
follow
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
matter
was
closed
but
peggy
her
heart
thumping
like
a
her
eyes
full
of
excitement
implored
him
to
stop
for
a
moment
i
appreciate
this
great
honor
but
i
have
a
request
to
make
she
said
clearly
mohammed
paused
irresolutely
and
in
some
irritation
here
where
the
heathen
gets
it
among
the
beads
whispered
monty
to
dan
and
he
called
out
captain
perry
detail
half
a
dozen
men
to
pick
up
the
beads
that
are
about
to
slip
from
his
majesty
neck
chapter
xxiv
the
sheik
strategy
peggy
gave
the
sheik
an
entrancing
smile
followed
by
a
brief
glance
at
the
beaming
miss
valentine
who
nodded
her
head
approvingly
wo
you
give
me
time
to
go
below
and
pack
my
belongings
that
they
may
be
sent
ashore
she
asked
naively
thunder
gasped
monty
that
no
way
to
turn
him
down
what
do
you
mean
monty
brewster
she
cried
turning
upon
him
with
flashing
eyes
why
you
encouraging
the
old
guy
he
protested
disappointment
in
every
inflection
and
what
if
i
am
is
it
my
affair
i
think
i
am
right
in
suspecting
that
he
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
is
it
my
privilege
to
accept
him
if
i
wish
brewster
face
was
a
study
he
could
not
believe
that
she
was
in
earnest
but
there
was
a
ghastly
feeling
that
the
joke
was
being
turned
on
him
the
rest
of
the
company
stared
hard
at
the
flushed
peggy
and
breathlessly
waited
developments
it
wo
do
to
trifle
with
this
chap
peggy
said
monty
coming
quite
close
to
her
do
lead
him
on
he
might
get
nasty
if
he
thinks
you
making
sport
of
him
you
are
quite
absurd
monty
she
cried
petulantly
i
am
not
making
sport
of
him
well
then
why
do
you
tell
him
to
go
about
his
business
i
do
see
any
beads
lying
around
loose
said
rip
tormentingly
the
sheik
impatiently
said
something
to
the
interpreter
and
that
worthy
repeated
it
for
peggy
benefit
the
son
of
the
prophet
desires
that
you
be
as
quick
as
possible
queen
of
the
world
he
tires
of
waiting
and
commands
you
to
come
with
him
at
once
peggy
winced
and
her
eyes
shot
a
brief
look
of
scorn
at
the
scowling
sheik
in
an
instant
however
she
was
smiling
agreeably
and
was
turning
toward
the
steps
holy
mackerel
where
are
you
going
peggy
cried
lotless
the
first
to
turn
fearful
to
throw
some
things
into
my
trunk
she
responded
airily
will
you
come
with
me
mary
peggy
cried
brewster
angrily
this
has
gone
far
enough
you
should
have
spoken
sooner
monty
she
said
quietly
what
are
you
going
to
do
margaret
cried
dan
her
eyes
wide
with
amazement
i
am
going
to
marry
the
son
of
the
prophet
she
replied
so
decidedly
that
every
one
gasped
a
moment
later
she
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
excited
women
and
captain
perry
was
calling
the
jackies
forward
in
a
voice
of
thunder
brewster
pushed
his
way
to
her
side
his
face
as
white
as
death
this
is
a
joke
peggy
he
cried
go
below
and
i
get
rid
of
the
sheik
just
then
the
burly
algerian
asserted
himself
he
did
not
like
the
way
in
which
his
adored
one
was
being
handled
by
the
white
dogs
and
with
two
spearmen
he
rushed
up
to
brewster
jabbering
angrily
stand
back
you
idiot
or
i
punch
your
head
off
said
brewster
with
sudden
emphasis
it
was
not
until
this
moment
that
peggy
realized
that
there
might
be
a
serious
side
to
the
little
farce
she
and
mary
had
decided
to
play
for
the
punishment
of
brewster
terror
suddenly
took
the
place
of
mirth
and
she
clung
frantically
to
monty
arm
i
was
joking
monty
only
joking
she
cried
oh
what
have
i
done
it
my
fault
he
exclaimed
but
i
take
care
of
you
never
fear
stand
aside
roared
the
sheik
threateningly
the
situation
was
ominous
frightened
as
they
were
the
women
could
not
flee
but
stood
as
if
petrified
sailors
eagerly
swarmed
to
the
deck
get
off
this
boat
said
monty
ominously
calm
to
the
interpreter
or
we
pitch
you
and
your
whole
mob
into
the
sea
keep
cool
keep
cool
cried
subway
smith
quickly
he
stepped
between
brewster
and
the
angry
suitor
and
that
action
alone
prevented
serious
trouble
while
he
parleyed
with
the
sheik
demille
hurried
peggy
to
a
safe
place
below
deck
and
they
were
followed
by
a
flock
of
shivering
women
poor
peggy
was
almost
in
tears
and
the
piteous
glances
she
threw
at
brewster
when
he
stepped
between
her
and
the
impetuous
sheik
who
had
started
to
follow
struck
deep
into
his
heart
and
made
him
ready
to
fight
to
the
death
for
her
it
took
nearly
an
hour
to
convince
the
algerian
that
peggy
had
misunderstood
him
and
that
american
women
were
not
to
be
wooed
after
the
african
fashion
he
finally
departed
with
his
entire
train
thoroughly
dissatisfied
and
in
high
dudgeon
at
first
he
threatened
to
take
her
by
force
then
he
agreed
to
give
her
another
day
in
which
to
make
up
her
mind
to
go
with
him
peaceably
and
again
he
concluded
that
a
bird
in
the
hand
was
worth
two
in
the
bush
brewster
stood
gloomily
on
the
outside
of
the
excited
group
glowering
upon
the
ugly
suitor
cooler
heads
had
relegated
him
to
this
place
of
security
during
the
diplomatic
contest
the
sheik
threats
of
vengeance
were
direful
he
swore
by
somebody
beard
that
he
would
bring
ten
thousand
men
to
establish
his
claim
by
force
his
intense
desire
to
fight
for
her
then
and
there
was
quelled
by
captain
detachment
of
six
lusty
sailors
whose
big
bare
fists
were
shaken
vigorously
under
a
few
startled
noses
it
took
all
the
fight
out
of
the
sheik
and
his
train
three
retainers
fell
into
the
sea
while
trying
to
retreat
as
far
as
possible
from
danger
mohammed
departed
with
the
irate
declaration
that
he
would
come
another
day
and
that
the
whole
world
would
tremble
at
his
approach
disgusted
with
himself
and
afraid
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
other
men
brewster
went
below
in
search
of
peggy
he
took
time
to
comfort
the
anxious
women
who
crowded
about
him
and
then
asked
for
miss
gray
she
was
in
her
stateroom
and
would
not
come
forth
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
a
dismal
troubled
voice
from
within
told
him
to
go
away
come
out
peggy
it
all
over
he
called
please
go
away
monty
she
said
what
are
you
doing
in
there
there
was
a
long
pause
and
then
came
the
pitiful
little
wail
i
am
unpacking
please
sir
that
night
brewster
entertained
on
board
the
yacht
several
resident
french
and
english
acquaintances
being
the
guests
of
honor
the
story
of
the
day
was
told
by
dan
demille
commissioned
especially
for
the
duty
she
painted
the
scene
so
vividly
that
the
guests
laughed
with
joy
over
the
discomfiture
of
the
sheik
peggy
and
brewster
found
themselves
looking
sheepishly
at
one
another
now
and
then
in
the
course
of
the
recital
she
purposely
had
avoided
him
during
the
evening
but
she
had
gamely
endured
the
raillery
that
came
from
the
rest
of
the
party
if
she
was
a
bit
pale
it
was
not
surprising
now
that
it
was
over
the
whole
affair
appalled
her
more
than
she
could
have
suspected
when
several
of
the
guests
of
the
evening
soberly
announced
that
mohammed
was
a
dangerous
man
and
even
an
object
of
worry
to
the
government
she
felt
a
strange
catch
in
her
throat
and
her
now
mirthless
eyes
turned
instinctively
to
brewster
who
it
seemed
was
the
special
object
of
aversion
the
next
day
she
and
monty
talked
it
over
the
penitence
of
both
was
beautiful
to
behold
each
denied
the
other
the
privilege
of
assuming
all
the
blame
and
both
were
so
happy
that
mohammed
was
little
more
than
a
preposition
in
their
conversation
so
far
as
prominence
was
concerned
but
all
day
long
the
harbor
was
full
of
fisher
boats
and
at
nightfall
they
still
were
lolling
about
sinister
restless
mysterious
like
purposeless
buzzards
and
the
dark
men
on
board
were
taking
up
no
fish
neither
were
they
minding
the
nets
that
lay
dry
and
folded
in
the
bottom
of
their
boats
far
into
the
night
there
was
revelry
on
board
the
flitter
more
guests
having
come
out
from
the
city
the
dark
hours
before
the
dawn
of
day
had
arrived
before
they
put
off
for
shore
but
the
fisher
boats
still
were
bobbing
about
in
the
black
waters
of
the
harbor
the
lights
gradually
disappeared
from
the
of
the
yacht
and
the
tired
watch
was
about
to
be
relieved
monty
brewster
and
peggy
remained
on
deck
after
the
guests
had
gone
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
they
were
leaning
over
the
rail
aft
listening
to
the
jovial
voices
of
the
visitors
as
they
grew
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
the
lights
of
the
town
were
few
but
they
could
plainly
be
seen
from
the
offing
are
you
tired
peggy
asked
brewster
with
a
touch
of
tenderness
somehow
of
late
he
had
often
felt
a
strange
desire
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
now
it
was
strong
upon
him
she
was
very
near
and
there
was
a
drooping
weariness
in
her
attitude
which
seemed
to
demand
protection
i
have
a
queer
feeling
that
something
awful
is
going
to
happen
monty
she
answered
trouble
in
her
soft
voice
you
nervous
that
all
he
said
and
you
should
get
to
sleep
their
hands
touched
in
the
darkness
and
the
thrill
that
went
over
him
told
a
truth
of
which
he
had
been
only
vaguely
conscious
the
power
of
it
made
him
exultant
yet
when
he
thought
of
her
and
her
too
quiet
affection
for
him
it
left
him
despondent
something
bumped
against
the
side
of
the
ship
and
a
grating
sound
followed
then
came
other
gentle
thuds
combined
with
the
soft
swish
of
water
disturbed
peggy
and
brewster
were
on
the
point
of
going
below
when
their
attention
was
caught
by
these
strange
sounds
what
is
it
she
asked
as
they
paused
irresolutely
he
strode
to
the
rail
the
girl
following
close
behind
him
three
sharp
little
whistles
came
from
above
and
behind
them
but
before
they
had
time
even
to
speculate
as
to
their
meaning
the
result
was
in
evidence
over
the
sides
of
the
ship
came
shadowy
forms
as
if
by
magic
at
their
backs
bodies
dropped
to
the
deck
with
stealthy
thuds
as
if
coming
from
the
inky
sky
above
there
was
an
instant
of
dreadful
calm
and
then
the
crisis
a
dozen
sinewy
forms
hurled
themselves
upon
brewster
who
taken
completely
by
surprise
was
thrown
to
the
deck
in
an
instant
his
attempt
to
cry
out
for
help
being
checked
by
heavy
hands
peggy
scream
was
cut
off
quickly
and
paralyzed
by
terror
she
felt
herself
engulfed
in
strong
arms
and
smothered
into
silence
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
there
was
no
chance
to
give
the
alarm
no
opportunity
to
resist
brewster
felt
himself
lifted
bodily
and
then
there
was
the
sensation
of
falling
he
struck
something
forcibly
with
all
his
weight
and
fell
back
with
a
crash
to
the
deck
afterward
he
found
that
the
effort
to
throw
him
overboard
had
failed
only
because
his
assailants
in
their
haste
had
hurled
him
against
an
unseen
stanchion
peggy
was
borne
forward
and
lowered
swiftly
into
arms
that
deposited
her
roughly
upon
something
hard
there
was
a
jerky
rocking
motion
the
sudden
splash
of
oars
and
then
she
knew
no
more
the
invaders
had
planned
with
a
craftiness
and
patience
that
deserved
success
for
hours
they
had
waited
silently
watchfully
and
with
deadly
assurance
how
they
crept
up
to
the
flitter
in
such
numbers
and
how
the
more
daring
came
aboard
long
before
the
blow
was
struck
no
one
ever
explained
so
quickly
and
so
accurately
was
the
abduction
performed
that
the
boats
were
well
clear
of
the
yacht
before
alarm
was
given
by
one
of
the
watch
who
had
been
overlooked
in
the
careful
assault
sleepy
sailors
rushed
on
deck
with
a
promptness
that
was
amazing
very
quickly
they
had
found
and
unbound
brewster
carried
a
couple
of
wounded
shipmates
below
and
had
captain
perry
in
his
pajamas
on
deck
to
take
command
the
searchlight
cried
brewster
frantically
the
devils
have
stolen
miss
gray
while
swift
hands
were
lowering
the
boats
for
the
chase
others
were
carrying
firearms
on
deck
the
searchlight
threw
its
mighty
white
arm
out
over
the
water
before
many
seconds
had
passed
and
eager
eyes
were
looking
for
the
boats
of
the
pillagers
the
arabs
had
reckoned
without
the
searchlight
their
fierce
exultation
died
suddenly
when
the
mysterious
streak
of
light
shot
into
the
sky
and
then
swept
down
upon
the
sea
hunting
them
out
of
the
darkness
like
a
great
relentless
eye
the
flitter
boats
were
in
the
water
and
manned
by
sturdy
oarsmen
before
the
glad
cry
went
up
that
the
robber
fleet
had
been
discovered
they
were
so
near
the
yacht
that
it
was
evident
the
dusky
tribesmen
were
poor
oarsmen
in
the
clear
light
from
the
ship
deck
they
could
be
seen
paddling
wildly
their
white
robes
fluttering
as
though
inspired
by
fear
there
were
four
boats
all
of
them
crowded
to
the
gunwales
keep
the
light
on
them
captain
shouted
monty
from
below
try
to
pick
out
the
boat
that
has
miss
gray
on
board
pull
away
boys
this
means
a
hundred
dollars
to
every
one
of
you
yes
a
thousand
if
we
have
to
fight
for
her
kill
every
damned
one
of
them
brewster
roared
the
captain
who
had
retired
behind
a
boat
when
he
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
women
on
deck
three
boats
shot
away
from
the
side
of
the
yacht
brewster
and
joe
bragdon
in
the
first
both
armed
with
rifles
let
take
a
shot
at
cried
a
sailor
who
stood
in
the
stern
with
his
finger
on
a
trigger
do
do
that
we
do
know
what
boat
holds
peggy
commanded
brewster
keep
cool
boys
and
be
ready
to
scrap
if
we
have
to
he
was
half
mad
with
fear
and
anxiety
and
he
was
determined
to
exterminate
the
bands
of
robbers
if
harm
came
to
the
girl
in
their
power
she
in
the
second
boat
came
the
cry
from
the
yacht
and
the
searchlight
was
kept
on
that
particular
object
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
but
captain
perry
saw
the
wisdom
of
keeping
all
of
them
clearly
located
in
order
to
prevent
trickery
brewster
brawny
sailor
boys
came
up
like
greyhounds
cheering
as
they
dashed
among
the
boats
of
the
fugitives
three
or
four
shots
were
fired
into
the
air
by
the
zealous
american
lads
and
there
were
loud
cries
from
the
arabs
as
they
veered
off
monty
boat
was
now
in
the
path
of
light
and
not
far
behind
the
one
which
held
peggy
he
was
standing
in
the
bow
take
care
of
the
others
he
called
back
to
his
followers
we
go
after
the
leaders
the
response
from
behind
was
a
cheer
a
half
dozen
shots
and
some
of
the
most
joyous
profanity
that
ever
fell
from
the
lips
of
american
sailors
mingled
with
shrieks
from
the
boats
they
were
to
take
care
of
stop
brewster
shouted
to
the
arabs
stop
or
we
kill
every
one
of
you
his
boat
was
not
more
than
fifty
feet
from
the
other
suddenly
a
tall
figure
arose
in
the
middle
of
the
egyptian
craft
and
a
moment
later
the
pursuers
saw
peggy
form
passed
up
to
him
she
was
instantly
clasped
by
one
of
his
long
arms
and
the
other
was
lifted
high
above
her
a
gleaming
knife
was
held
in
the
upraised
hand
fire
on
us
if
you
dare
came
in

from

chapter
xxv
the
rescue
of
peggy
brewster
heart
almost
ceased
beating
and
every
vestige
of
color
left
his
face
clear
and
distinct
in
the
light
from
the
yacht
the
arab
and
his
burden
were
outlined
against
the
black
screen
beyond
there
was
no
mistaking
the
earnestness
of
the
threat
nor
could
the
witnesses
doubt
the
ghastly
intention
of
the
long
cruel
knife
that
gleamed
on
high
peggy
body
served
as
a
shield
for
that
of
her
captor
brewster
and
bragdon
recognized
the
man
as
one
of
mohammed
principal
retainers
a
fellow
who
had
attracted
more
than
usual
attention
on
the
day
of
the
sheik
visit
for
god
sake
do
kill
her
cried
brewster
in
agonized
tones
there
was
a
diabolical
grin
on
the
face
of
the
arab
who
was
about
to
shout
back
some
defiant
taunt
when
the
unexpected
happened
the
sharp
crack
of
a
gun
sounded
in
the
stern
of
brewster
boat
and
an
unerring
bullet
sped
straight
for
the
big
arab
forehead
it
crashed
between
his
eyes
and
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
the
knife
flew
from
his
hand
his
body
straightened
and
then
collapsed
toppling
over
not
among
his
oarsmen
but
across
the
gunwale
of
the
craft
before
a
hand
could
be
lifted
to
prevent
the
dead
arab
and
the
girl
were
plunged
into
the
sea
a
cry
of
horror
went
up
from
the
americans
and
something
surprisingly
like
a
shout
of
triumph
from
the
abductors
even
as
brewster
poised
for
the
spring
into
the
water
a
flying
form
shot
past
him
and
into
the
sea
with
a
resounding
splash
the
man
that
fired
the
shot
had
reckoned
cleverly
and
he
was
carrying
out
the
final
details
of
an
inspired
plan
the
arab
position
as
he
stood
in
the
boat
was
such
as
to
warrant
the
sailor
belief
that
he
could
fall
no
other
way
than
forward
and
that
meant
over
the
side
of
the
boat
with
all
this
clearly
in
mind
he
had
shot
straight
and
true
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
water
almost
as
the
two
toppled
overboard
monty
brewster
was
in
the
water
an
instant
later
striking
out
for
the
spot
where
they
had
disappeared
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
course
in
which
his
boat
was
running
there
was
a
rattle
of
firearms
with
curses
and
cheers
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
these
sounds
he
was
a
length
or
two
behind
the
sailor
praying
with
all
his
soul
that
one
or
the
other
might
succeed
in
reaching
the
white
robes
that
still
kept
the
surface
of
the
water
his
crew
was
backing
water
and
straining
every
muscle
to
bring
the
boat
around
sharp
for
the
rescue
the
sailor
powerful
strokes
brought
him
to
the
spot
first
but
not
in
time
to
clutch
the
disappearing
white
robes
just
as
he
reached
out
an
arm
to
grasp
the
form
of
the
girl
she
went
down
he
did
not
hesitate
a
second
but
followed
peggy
had
fallen
from
the
dead
arab
embrace
and
that
worthy
already
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
she
was
half
conscious
when
the
shot
came
but
the
plunge
into
the
cold
water
revived
her
her
struggles
were
enough
to
keep
her
up
for
a
few
moments
but
not
long
enough
for
the
swimmers
to
reach
her
side
she
felt
herself
going
down
and
down
strangling
smothering
dying
then
something
clutched
her
arm
and
she
had
the
sensation
of
being
jerked
upward
violently
the
sailor
fought
his
way
to
the
surface
with
the
girl
and
brewster
was
at
his
side
in
an
instant
together
they
supported
her
until
one
of
the
boats
came
up
and
they
were
drawn
over
the
side
to
safety
by
this
time
the
abductors
had
scattered
like
sheep
without
a
leader
and
as
there
was
no
further
object
in
pursuing
them
the
little
american
fleet
put
back
for
the
yacht
in
great
haste
peggy
was
quite
conscious
when
carried
aboard
by
the
triumphant
brewster
the
words
he
whispered
to
her
as
she
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
were
enough
to
give
her
life
the
excitement
on
board
the
flitter
was
boundless
fear
gave
way
to
joy
and
where
despair
had
for
a
moment
reigned
supreme
there
was
now
the
most
insane
delight
peggy
was
bundled
below
and
into
her
berth
lotless
attending
her
assisted
by
all
the
women
on
board
brewster
and
the
sailor
drenched
but
happy
were
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
enthusiastic
supporters
to
a
place
where
hot
toddies
were
to
be
had
before
blankets
you
have
returned
the
favor
conroy
said
brewster
fervently
as
he
leaned
across
the
heads
of
his
bearers
to
shake
hands
with
the
sailor
who
was
sharing
the
honors
with
him
conroy
was
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
as
he
sat
perched
on
the
shoulders
of
his
shipmates
i
was
luckier
than
i
thought
in
saving
your
life
that
day
it
was
anything
brewster
said
young
conroy
i
saw
a
chance
to
drop
the
big
nigger
and
then
it
was
up
to
me
to
get
her
out
of
the
water
you
took
a
big
risk
conroy
but
you
made
good
with
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
my
boy
they
might
have
got
away
with
miss
gray
do
mention
it
brewster
it
was
nothing
to
do
protested
conroy
in
confusion
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
and
for
her
what
is
the
adage
about
casting
your
bread
upon
the
water
and
getting
it
back
again
asked
rip
van
winkle
of
joe
bragdon
as
they
jubilantly
followed
the
procession
below
there
was
no
more
sleep
on
board
that
night
in
fact
the
sun
was
not
long
in
showing
itself
after
the
rescuers
returned
to
the
vessel
the
daring
attempt
of
mohammed
emissaries
was
discussed
without
restraint
and
every
sailor
had
a
story
to
tell
of
the
pursuit
and
rescue
the
event
furnished
conversational
food
for
days
and
days
among
both
the
seamen
and
the
passengers
dan
demille
blamed
himself
relentlessly
for
sleeping
through
it
all
and
moped
for
hours
because
he
had
lost
a
magnificent
chance
to
do
something
the
next
morning
he
proposed
to
hunt
for
the
sheik
and
offered
to
lead
an
assault
in
person
an
investigation
was
made
and
government
officials
tried
to
call
mohammed
to
account
but
he
had
fled
to
the
desert
and
the
search
was
fruitless
brewster
refused
to
accept
a
share
of
the
glory
of
peggy
rescue
pushing
conroy
forward
as
the
real
hero
but
the
sailor
insisted
that
he
could
not
have
succeeded
without
help
that
he
was
completely
exhausted
when
monty
came
to
the
rescue
peggy
found
it
hard
to
thank
him
gently
while
her
heart
was
so
dangerously
near
the
riot
point
and
her
words
of
gratitude
sounded
pitifully
weak
and
insufficient
it
would
have
been
the
same
had
anybody
else
gone
to
her
rescue
he
mused
dejectedly
she
cares
for
me
with
the
devotion
of
a
sister
and
that
all
peggy
peggy
he
moaned
if
you
could
only
love
me
i
i
oh
well
there
no
use
thinking
about
it
she
will
love
some
one
else
of
course
and
and
be
happy
too
if
she
appear
only
as
grateful
to
me
as
to
conroy
i
be
satisfied
he
had
the
luck
to
be
first
that
all
but
god
knows
i
tried
to
do
it
dan
demille
was
keen
enough
to
see
how
the
land
lay
and
she
at
once
tried
to
set
matters
straight
she
was
far
too
clever
to
push
her
campaign
ruthlessly
but
laid
her
foundations
and
then
built
cunningly
and
securely
with
the
most
substantial
material
that
came
to
hand
from
day
to
day
her
subjects
were
taking
themselves
too
deeply
to
heart
to
appreciate
interference
on
the
part
of
an
outsider
and
dan
was
wise
in
the
whims
of
love
peggy
was
not
herself
for
several
days
after
her
experience
and
the
whole
party
felt
a
distinct
relief
when
the
yacht
finally
left
the
harbor
and
steamed
off
to
the
west
a
cablegram
that
came
the
day
before
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
brewster
depression
but
he
was
not
the
sort
to
confess
it
it
was
from
swearengen
jones
of
butte
montana
and
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
laconic
admonition
it
read
brewster
consulate
alexandria
have
a
good
time
while
good
times
last
jones
his
brain
was
almost
bursting
with
the
hopes
and
fears
and
uncertainties
that
crowded
it
far
beyond
its
ordinary
capacity
it
had
come
to
the
point
it
seemed
to
him
when
the
brains
of
a
dozen
men
at
least
were
required
to
operate
the
affairs
that
were
surging
into
his
alone
the
mere
fact
that
the
end
of
his
year
was
less
than
two
months
off
and
that
there
was
more
or
less
uncertainty
as
to
the
character
of
the
end
was
sufficient
cause
for
worry
but
the
new
trouble
was
infinitely
harder
to
endure
when
he
sat
down
to
think
over
his
financial
enterprises
his
mind
treacherously
wandered
off
to
peggy
gray
and
then
everything
was
hopeless
he
recalled
the
courage
and
confidence
that
had
carried
him
to
barbara
drew
with
a
declaration
of
love
to
the
stunning
worldly
barbara
and
smiled
bitterly
when
he
saw
how
basely
the
two
allies
were
deserting
him
in
this
hour
of
love
for
peggy
gray
for
some
reason
he
had
felt
sure
of
barbara
for
another
reason
he
saw
no
chance
with
peggy
she
was
not
the
same
sort
she
was
different
she
was
well
she
was
peggy
occasionally
his
reflections
assumed
the
importance
of
calculations
his
cruise
was
sure
to
cost
a
princely
sum
but
not
enough
swearengen
jones
and
his
cablegram
did
not
awe
him
to
a
great
extent
the
spending
of
the
million
had
become
a
mania
with
him
now
and
he
had
no
regard
for
consequences
his
one
desire
aside
from
peggy
was
to
increase
the
cost
of
the
cruise
they
were
leaving
gibraltar
when
a
new
idea
came
into
his
troubled
head
he
decided
to
change
his
plans
and
sail
for
the
north
cape
thereby
adding
more
than
to
his
credit
chapter
xxvi
mutiny
monty
was
on
deck
when
the
inspiration
seized
him
and
he
lost
no
time
in
telling
his
guests
who
were
at
breakfast
although
he
had
misgivings
about
their
opinion
of
the
scheme
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
ominous
silence
that
followed
his
announcement
are
you
in
earnest
mr
brewster
asked
captain
perry
who
was
the
first
of
the
company
to
recover
from
the
surprise
of
course
i
am
i
chartered
this
boat
for
four
months
with
the
privilege
of
another
month
i
can
see
no
reason
to
prevent
us
from
prolonging
the
trip
monty
manner
was
full
of
as
he
continued
you
people
are
so
in
the
habit
of
protesting
against
every
suggestion
i
make
that
you
ca
help
doing
it
now
but
monty
said
dan
what
if
your
guests
would
rather
go
home
nonsense
you
were
asked
for
a
five
months
cruise
besides
think
of
getting
home
in
the
middle
of
august
with
every
one
away
it
would
be
like
going
to
philadelphia
brave
as
he
was
in
the
presence
of
his
friends
in
the
privacy
of
his
stateroom
monty
gave
way
to
the
depression
that
was
bearing
down
upon
him
it
was
the
hardest
task
of
his
life
to
go
on
with
his
scheme
in
the
face
of
opposition
he
knew
that
every
man
and
woman
on
board
was
against
the
proposition
for
his
sake
at
least
and
it
was
difficult
to
be
arbitrary
under
the
circumstances
purposely
he
avoided
peggy
all
forenoon
his
single
glance
at
her
face
in
the
salon
was
enough
to
disturb
him
immeasurably
the
spirits
of
the
crowd
were
subdued
the
north
cape
had
charms
but
the
proclamation
concerning
it
had
been
too
sudden
had
reversed
too
quickly
the
general
expectation
and
desire
many
of
the
guests
had
plans
at
home
for
august
and
even
those
who
had
none
were
satiated
with
excitement
during
the
morning
they
gathered
in
little
knots
to
discuss
the
situation
they
were
all
generous
and
each
one
was
sure
that
he
could
cruise
indefinitely
if
on
monty
account
the
new
voyage
were
not
out
of
the
question
they
felt
it
their
duty
to
take
a
desperate
stand
the
little
gatherings
resolved
themselves
into
ominous
groups
and
in
the
end
there
was
a
call
for
a
general
meeting
in
the
main
cabin
captain
perry
the
first
mate
and
the
chief
engineer
were
included
in
the
call
but
montgomery
brewster
was
not
to
be
admitted
joe
bragdon
loyally
agreed
to
keep
him
engaged
elsewhere
while
the
meeting
was
in
progress
the
doors
were
locked
and
a
cursory
glance
assured
the
chairman
of
the
meeting
dan
demille
that
no
member
of
the
party
was
missing
save
the
devoted
bragdon
captain
perry
was
plainly
nervous
and
disturbed
the
others
were
the
victims
of
a
suppressed
energy
that
presaged
subsequent
eruptions
captain
perry
we
are
assembled
here
for
a
purpose
said
demille
clearing
his
throat
three
times
first
of
all
as
we
understand
it
you
are
the
sailing
master
of
this
ship
in
other
words
you
are
according
to
maritime
law
the
commander
of
this
expedition
you
alone
can
give
orders
to
the
sailors
and
you
alone
can
clear
a
port
brewster
has
no
authority
except
that
vested
in
a
common
employer
am
i
correct
demille
if
brewster
instructs
me
to
sail
for
the
north
cape
i
shall
do
so
said
the
captain
firmly
this
boat
is
his
for
the
full
term
of
the
lease
and
i
am
engaged
to
sail
her
with
my
crew
until
the
tenth
of
next
september
we
understand
your
position
captain
and
i
am
sure
you
appreciate
ours
it
is
that
we
want
to
end
a
very
delightful
cruise
but
that
we
regard
it
as
sheer
folly
for
brewster
to
extend
the
tour
at
such
tremendous
expense
he
is
or
was
a
rich
man
but
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
the
fact
that
he
is
plunging
much
too
heavily
in
plain
words
we
want
to
keep
him
from
spending
more
of
his
money
on
this
cruise
do
you
understand
our
position
captain
perry
fully
i
wish
with
all
my
soul
that
i
could
help
you
and
him
my
hands
are
tied
by
contract
however
much
as
i
regret
it
at
this
moment
how
does
the
crew
feel
about
this
additional
trip
captain
asked
demille
they
shipped
for
five
months
and
will
receive
five
months
pay
the
men
have
been
handsomely
treated
and
they
will
stick
to
brewster
to
the
end
said
the
captain
there
is
no
chance
for
a
mutiny
then
asked
smith
regretfully
the
captain
gave
him
a
hard
look
but
said
nothing
everybody
seemed
uncomfortable
apparently
the
only
way
is
the
one
suggested
by
smith
this
morning
said
dan
speaking
for
the
women
no
one
will
object
i
am
sure
if
captain
perry
and
his
chief
officers
are
allowed
to
hear
the
plan
it
is
very
necessary
in
fact
said
valentine
we
can
not
proceed
without
them
but
they
will
agree
with
us
i
am
sure
that
it
is
wise
an
hour
later
the
meeting
broke
up
and
the
conspirators
made
their
way
to
the
deck
it
was
a
strange
fact
that
no
one
went
alone
they
were
in
groups
of
three
and
four
and
the
mystery
that
hung
about
them
was
almost
perceptible
not
one
was
willing
to
face
the
excited
buoyant
brewster
without
help
they
found
strength
and
security
in
companionship
peggy
was
the
one
rebel
against
the
conspiracy
and
yet
she
knew
that
the
others
were
justified
in
the
step
they
proposed
to
take
she
reluctantly
joined
them
in
the
end
but
felt
that
she
was
the
darkest
traitor
in
the
crowd
forgetting
her
own
distress
over
the
way
in
which
monty
was
squandering
his
fortune
she
stood
out
the
one
defender
of
his
rights
until
the
end
and
then
admitted
tearfully
to
demille
that
she
had
been
quite
unreasonable
in
doing
so
alone
in
her
stateroom
after
signing
the
agreement
she
wondered
what
he
would
think
of
her
she
owed
him
so
much
that
she
at
least
should
have
stood
by
him
she
felt
that
he
would
be
conscious
of
this
how
could
she
have
turned
against
him
he
would
not
understand
of
course
he
would
never
understand
and
he
would
hate
her
with
the
others
more
than
the
others
it
was
all
a
wretched
muddle
and
she
could
not
see
her
way
out
of
it
monty
found
his
guests
very
difficult
they
listened
to
his
plans
with
but
little
interest
and
he
could
not
but
see
that
they
were
uncomfortable
the
situation
was
new
to
their
experience
and
they
were
under
a
strain
they
mope
around
like
a
lot
of
pouting
boys
and
girls
he
growled
to
himself
but
it
the
north
cape
now
in
spite
of
everything
i
do
care
if
the
whole
crowd
deserts
me
my
mind
is
made
up
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
see
peggy
alone
he
had
much
that
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
and
he
hungered
for
the
consolation
her
approval
would
bring
him
but
she
clung
to
pettingill
with
a
tenacity
that
was
discouraging
the
old
feeling
of
jealousy
that
was
connected
with
como
again
disturbed
him
she
thinks
that
i
am
a
hopeless
brainless
idiot
he
said
to
himself
and
i
do
blame
her
either
just
before
nightfall
he
noticed
that
his
friends
were
assembling
in
the
bow
as
he
started
to
join
the
group
subway
smith
and
demille
advanced
to
meet
him
some
of
the
others
were
smiling
a
little
sheepishly
but
the
two
men
were
pictures
of
solemnity
and
decision
monty
said
demille
steadily
we
have
been
conspiring
against
you
and
have
decided
that
we
sail
for
new
york
morning
brewster
stopped
short
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
one
they
never
could
forget
bewilderment
uncertainty
and
pain
succeeded
each
other
like
flashes
of
light
not
a
word
was
spoken
for
several
seconds
the
red
of
humiliation
slowly
mounted
to
his
cheeks
while
in
his
eyes
wavered
the
look
of
one
who
has
been
hunted
down
you
have
decided
he
asked
lifelessly
and
more
than
one
heart
went
out
in
pity
to
him
we
hated
to
do
it
monty
but
for
your
own
sake
there
was
no
other
way
said
subway
smith
quickly
we
took
a
vote
and
there
was
a
dissenting
voice
it
is
a
plain
case
of
mutiny
i
take
it
said
monty
utterly
alone
and
it
is
necessary
to
tell
you
why
we
have
taken
this
step
said
demille
it
is
to
oppose
you
at
this
stage
of
the
game
you
been
the
best
ever
and
cut
that
cried
monty
and
his
confidence
in
himself
was
fast
returning
this
is
no
time
to
throw
bouquets
we
like
you
brewster
valentine
came
to
the
assistance
because
the
others
had
looked
at
him
so
appealingly
we
like
you
so
well
that
we
ca
take
the
responsibility
for
your
extravagance
it
would
disgrace
us
all
that
side
of
the
matter
was
never
mentioned
cried
peggy
indignantly
and
then
added
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
we
thought
only
of
you
i
appreciate
your
motives
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
said
monty
i
am
more
sorry
than
i
can
tell
you
that
the
cruise
must
end
in
this
way
but
i
too
have
decided
the
yacht
will
take
you
to
some
point
where
you
can
catch
a
steamer
to
new
york
i
shall
secure
passage
for
the
entire
party
and
very
soon
you
will
be
at
home
captain
perry
will
you
oblige
me
by
making
at
once
for
any
port
that
my
guests
may
agree
upon
he
was
turning
away
deliberately
when
subway
smith
detained
him
what
do
you
mean
by
getting
a
steamer
to
new
york
is
the
good
enough
he
asked
the
is
not
going
to
new
york
just
now
answered
brewster
firmly
notwithstanding
your
ultimatum
she
is
going
to
take
me
to
the
north
cape
chapter
xxvii
a
fair
traitor
now
will
you
be
good
cried
reggie
vanderpool
to
demille
as
monty
went
down
the
companionway
the
remark
was
precisely
what
was
needed
for
the
feelings
of
the
entire
company
were
now
poured
forth
upon
the
unfortunate
young
man
subway
smith
was
for
hanging
him
to
the
yard
arm
and
the
denunciation
of
the
others
was
so
decisive
that
reggie
sought
refuge
in
the
chart
house
but
the
atmosphere
had
been
materially
cleared
and
the
leaders
of
the
mutiny
were
in
a
position
to
go
into
executive
session
and
consider
the
matter
the
women
waited
on
deck
while
the
meeting
lasted
they
were
unanimous
in
the
opinion
that
the
affair
had
been
badly
managed
they
should
have
offered
to
stay
by
the
ship
providing
monty
would
let
demille
manage
the
cruise
said
miss
valentine
that
would
have
been
a
concession
and
at
the
same
time
it
would
have
put
the
cruise
on
an
economical
basis
in
other
words
you
will
accept
a
man
invitation
to
dinner
if
he
will
allow
you
to
order
it
and
invite
the
other
guests
said
peggy
who
was
quick
to
defend
monty
well
that
would
be
better
than
helping
to
eat
up
every
bit
of
food
he
possessed
but
miss
valentine
always
avoided
argument
when
she
could
and
gave
this
as
a
parting
thrust
before
she
walked
away
there
must
be
something
more
than
we
know
about
in
extravagance
said
dan
he
is
the
kind
of
man
to
squander
his
last
penny
without
having
something
left
to
show
for
it
there
must
be
a
method
in
his
madness
he
has
done
it
for
us
said
peggy
he
has
devoted
himself
all
along
to
giving
us
a
good
time
and
now
we
are
showing
our
gratitude
further
discussion
was
prevented
by
the
appearance
of
the
conspiring
committee
and
the
whole
company
was
summoned
to
hear
demille
report
as
chairman
we
have
found
a
solution
of
our
difficulties
he
began
and
his
manner
was
so
jubilant
that
every
one
became
hopeful
it
is
desperate
but
i
think
it
will
be
effective
monty
has
given
us
the
privilege
of
leaving
the
yacht
at
any
port
where
we
can
take
a
steamer
to
new
york
now
my
suggestion
is
that
we
select
the
most
convenient
place
for
all
of
us
and
obviously
there
is
nothing
quite
so
convenient
as
boston
dan
demille
you
are
quite
foolish
cried
his
wife
who
ever
conceived
such
a
ridiculous
idea
captain
perry
has
his
instructions
continued
demille
turning
to
the
captain
are
we
not
acting
along
the
lines
marked
out
by
brewster
himself
i
will
sail
for
boston
if
you
say
the
word
said
the
thoughtful
captain
but
he
is
sure
to
countermand
such
an
order
he
wo
be
able
to
captain
cried
subway
smith
who
had
for
some
time
been
eager
to
join
in
the
conversation
this
is
a
genuine
mutiny
and
we
expect
to
carry
out
the
original
plan
which
was
to
put
brewster
in
irons
until
we
are
safe
from
all
opposition
he
is
my
friend
smith
and
at
least
it
is
my
duty
to
protect
him
from
any
indignity
said
the
captain
stiffly
you
make
for
boston
my
dear
captain
and
we
do
the
rest
said
demille
brewster
ca
countermand
your
orders
unless
he
sees
you
in
person
we
see
to
it
that
he
has
no
chance
to
talk
to
you
until
we
are
in
sight
of
boston
harbor
the
captain
looked
doubtful
and
shook
his
head
as
he
walked
away
at
heart
he
was
with
the
mutineers
and
his
mind
was
made
up
to
assist
them
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
do
so
without
violating
his
obligations
to
brewster
he
felt
guilty
however
in
surreptitiously
giving
the
order
to
clear
for
boston
at
daybreak
the
chief
officers
were
let
into
the
secret
but
the
sailors
were
kept
in
darkness
regarding
the
destination
of
the
flitter
montgomery
brewster
guests
were
immensely
pleased
with
the
scheme
although
they
were
dubious
about
the
outcome
dan
regretted
her
hasty
comment
on
the
plan
and
entered
into
the
plot
with
eagerness
in
accordance
with
plans
decided
upon
by
the
mutineers
monty
stateroom
door
was
guarded
through
the
night
by
two
of
the
men
the
next
morning
as
he
emerged
from
his
room
he
was
met
by
subway
smith
and
dan
demille
good
morning
was
his
greeting
how
the
weather
bully
answered
demille
by
the
way
you
are
going
to
have
breakfast
in
your
room
old
man
brewster
unsuspectingly
led
the
way
into
his
stateroom
the
two
following
what
the
mystery
he
demanded
we
been
deputized
to
do
some
very
nasty
work
said
subway
as
he
turned
the
key
in
the
door
we
are
here
to
tell
you
what
port
we
have
chosen
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
tell
me
yes
is
it
but
we
have
studied
up
on
the
chivalrous
treatment
of
prisoners
we
have
decided
on
boston
is
there
a
boston
on
this
side
of
the
water
asked
monty
in
mild
surprise
no
there
is
only
one
boston
in
the
universe
so
far
as
we
know
it
is
a
large
body
of
intellect
surrounded
by
the
rest
of
the
world
what
the
devil
are
you
talking
about
you
do
mean
boston
massachusetts
cried
monty
leaping
to
his
feet
precisely
that
the
port
for
us
and
you
told
us
to
choose
for
ourselves
said
smith
well
i
wo
have
it
that
all
exclaimed
brewster
indignantly
captain
perry
takes
orders
from
me
and
from
no
one
else
he
already
has
his
orders
said
demille
smiling
mysteriously
i
see
about
that
brewster
sprang
to
the
door
it
was
locked
and
the
key
was
in
subway
smith
pocket
with
an
impatient
exclamation
he
turned
and
pressed
an
electric
button
it
wo
ring
monty
explained
subway
the
wire
has
been
cut
now
be
cool
for
a
minute
or
two
and
we
talk
it
over
brewster
stormed
for
five
minutes
the
delegation
sitting
calmly
by
smiling
with
exasperating
confidence
at
last
he
calmed
down
and
in
terms
of
reason
demanded
an
explanation
he
was
given
to
understand
that
the
yacht
would
sail
for
boston
and
that
he
would
be
kept
a
prisoner
for
the
entire
voyage
unless
he
submitted
to
the
will
of
the
majority
brewster
listened
darkly
to
the
proclamation
he
saw
that
they
had
gained
the
upper
hand
by
a
clever
ruse
and
that
only
strategy
on
his
part
could
outwit
them
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
submit
to
them
now
that
the
controversy
had
assumed
the
dignity
of
a
struggle
but
you
will
be
reasonable
wo
you
asked
demille
anxiously
i
intend
to
fight
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
said
brewster
his
eyes
flashing
at
present
i
am
your
prisoner
but
it
is
a
long
way
to
boston
for
three
days
and
two
nights
the
flitter
steamed
westward
into
the
atlantic
with
her
temporary
owner
locked
into
his
stateroom
the
confinement
was
irksome
but
he
rather
liked
the
sensation
of
being
interested
in
something
besides
money
he
frequently
laughed
to
himself
over
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
his
enemies
were
friends
true
and
devoted
his
gaolers
were
relentless
but
they
were
considerate
the
original
order
that
he
should
be
guarded
by
one
man
was
violated
on
the
first
day
there
were
times
when
his
guard
numbered
at
least
ten
persons
and
some
of
them
served
tea
and
begged
him
to
listen
to
reason
it
is
difficult
not
to
listen
he
said
fiercely
it
like
holding
a
man
down
and
then
asking
him
to
be
quiet
but
my
time
is
coming
revenge
will
be
his
exclaimed
dan
tragically
you
might
have
your
term
shortened
on
account
of
good
conduct
if
you
would
only
behave
suggested
peggy
whose
reserve
was
beginning
to
soften
please
be
good
and
give
in
i
have
been
happier
during
the
whole
cruise
said
monty
on
deck
i
would
be
noticed
but
here
i
am
quite
the
whole
thing
besides
i
can
get
out
whenever
i
feel
like
it
i
have
a
thousand
dollars
which
says
you
ca
said
demille
and
monty
snapped
him
up
so
eagerly
that
he
added
that
you
ca
get
out
of
your
own
accord
monty
acceded
to
the
condition
and
offered
odds
on
the
proposition
to
the
others
but
there
were
no
takers
that
settles
it
he
smiled
grimly
to
himself
i
can
make
a
thousand
dollars
by
staying
here
and
i
ca
afford
to
escape
on
the
third
day
of
monty
imprisonment
the
flitter
began
to
roll
heavily
at
first
he
gloated
over
the
discomfort
of
his
guards
who
obviously
did
not
like
to
stay
below
subway
smith
and
bragdon
were
on
duty
and
neither
was
famous
as
a
good
sailor
when
monty
lighted
his
pipe
there
was
consternation
and
subway
rushed
on
deck
you
are
a
brave
man
joe
monty
said
to
the
other
and
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
in
his
direction
i
knew
you
would
stick
to
your
post
you
would
leave
it
even
if
the
ship
should
go
down
bragdon
had
reached
the
stage
where
he
dared
not
speak
and
was
busying
himself
trying
to
breathe
with
the
motion
of
the
boat
as
he
had
called
it
by
gad
continued
monty
relentlessly
this
smoke
is
getting
thick
some
of
this
toilet
water
might
help
if
i
sprinkled
it
about
one
whiff
of
the
cologne
was
enough
for
bragdon
and
he
bolted
up
the
companionway
leaving
the
stateroom
door
wide
open
and
the
prisoner
free
to
go
where
he
pleased
monty
first
impulse
was
to
follow
but
he
checked
himself
on
the
threshold
damn
that
bet
with
demille
he
said
to
himself
and
added
aloud
to
the
fleeting
guard
the
key
joe
i
dare
you
to
come
back
and
get
it
but
bragdon
was
beyond
recall
and
monty
locked
the
door
on
the
inside
and
passed
the
key
through
the
ventilator
on
deck
a
small
part
of
the
company
braved
the
spray
in
the
lee
of
the
deck
house
but
the
others
had
long
since
gone
below
the
boat
was
pitching
furiously
in
the
ugliest
sea
it
had
encountered
and
there
was
anxiety
underneath
captain
perry
mask
of
unconcern
demille
and
lotless
talked
in
the
senseless
way
men
have
when
they
try
to
conceal
their
nervousness
but
the
women
did
not
respond
they
were
in
no
mood
for
conversation
only
one
of
them
was
quite
oblivious
to
personal
discomfort
and
danger
peggy
gray
was
thinking
of
the
prisoner
below
in
a
reflection
of
her
own
terror
she
pictured
him
crouching
in
the
little
like
a
doomed
criminal
awaiting
execution
alone
neglected
forgotten
unpitied
at
first
she
pleaded
for
the
men
for
his
release
but
they
insisted
upon
waiting
in
the
hope
that
a
scare
might
bring
him
to
his
senses
peggy
saw
that
no
help
was
to
be
secured
from
the
other
women
much
as
they
might
care
for
brewster
peace
of
mind
and
safety
her
heart
was
bitter
toward
every
one
responsible
for
the
situation
and
there
was
dark
rebellion
in
her
soul
it
culminated
finally
in
a
resolve
to
release
monty
brewster
at
any
cost
with
difficulty
she
made
her
way
to
the
stateroom
door
clinging
to
supports
at
times
and
then
plunging
violently
away
from
them
for
some
minutes
she
listened
frantically
clutching
brewster
door
and
the
there
was
no
guard
and
the
tumult
of
the
sea
drowned
every
sound
within
her
imagination
ran
riot
when
her
repeated
calls
were
not
answered
monty
monty
she
cried
pounding
wildly
on
the
door
who
is
it
what
is
the
trouble
came
in
muffled
tones
from
within
and
peggy
breathed
a
prayer
of
thanks
just
then
she
discovered
the
key
which
monty
had
dropped
and
quickly
opened
the
door
expecting
to
find
him
cowering
with
fear
but
the
picture
was
different
the
prisoner
was
seated
on
the
divan
propped
up
with
many
pillows
and
reading
with
the
aid
of
an
electric
light
the
intrusions
of
peggy
chapter
xxviii
a
catastrophe
oh
was
peggy
only
exclamation
and
there
was
a
shadow
of
disappointment
in
her
eyes
come
in
peggy
and
i
read
aloud
was
monty
cheerful
greeting
as
he
stood
before
her
no
i
must
go
said
peggy
confusedly
i
thought
you
might
be
nervous
about
the
storm
and
and
you
came
to
let
me
out
monty
had
never
been
so
happy
yes
and
i
do
care
what
the
others
say
i
thought
you
were
suffering
but
at
that
moment
the
boat
gave
a
lurch
which
threw
her
across
the
threshold
into
monty
arms
they
crashed
against
the
wall
and
he
held
her
a
moment
and
forgot
the
storm
when
she
drew
away
from
him
she
showed
him
the
open
door
and
freedom
she
could
not
speak
where
are
the
others
he
asked
bracing
himself
in
the
doorway
oh
monty
she
cried
we
must
not
go
to
them
they
will
think
me
a
traitor
why
were
you
a
traitor
peggy
he
demanded
turning
toward
her
suddenly
oh
oh
because
it
seemed
so
cruel
to
keep
you
locked
up
through
the
storm
she
answered
blushing
and
there
was
no
other
reason
he
persisted
do
please
do
she
cried
piteously
and
he
misunderstood
her
emotion
it
was
clear
that
she
was
merely
sorry
for
him
never
mind
peggy
it
all
right
you
stood
by
me
and
i
stand
by
you
come
on
we
face
the
mob
and
i
do
the
fighting
together
they
made
their
way
into
the
presence
of
the
mutineers
who
were
crowded
into
the
main
cabin
well
here
a
conspiracy
cried
dan
demille
but
there
was
no
anger
in
his
voice
how
did
you
escape
i
was
just
thinking
of
unlocking
your
door
monty
but
the
key
seemed
to
be
missing
peggy
displayed
it
triumphantly
by
jove
cried
dan
this
is
rank
treachery
who
was
on
guard
a
steward
rushing
through
the
cabin
at
this
moment
in
answer
to
frantic
calls
from
bragdon
furnished
an
eloquent
reply
to
the
question
it
was
simple
said
monty
the
guards
deserted
their
post
and
left
the
key
behind
then
it
is
up
to
me
to
pay
you
a
thousand
dollars
not
at
all
protested
monty
taken
aback
i
did
not
escape
of
my
own
accord
i
had
help
the
money
is
yours
and
now
that
i
am
free
he
added
quietly
let
me
say
that
this
boat
does
not
go
to
boston
just
what
i
expected
cried
vanderpool
she
going
straight
to
new
york
declared
monty
the
words
were
hardly
uttered
when
a
heavy
sea
sent
him
sprawling
across
the
cabin
and
he
concluded
or
to
the
bottom
not
so
bad
as
that
said
captain
perry
whose
entrance
had
been
somewhat
hastened
by
the
lurch
of
the
boat
but
until
this
blows
over
i
must
keep
you
below
he
laughed
but
he
saw
they
were
not
deceived
the
seas
are
pretty
heavy
and
the
decks
are
being
holystoned
for
nothing
but
i
would
like
to
have
any
of
you
washed
overboard
by
mistake
the
hatches
were
battened
down
and
it
was
a
sorry
company
that
tried
to
while
away
the
evening
in
the
main
cabin
monty
chafing
about
the
advantages
of
the
north
cape
over
the
stormy
atlantic
was
not
calculated
to
raise
the
drooping
spirits
and
it
was
very
early
when
he
and
his
shattered
guests
turned
in
there
was
little
sleep
on
board
the
flitter
that
night
even
if
it
had
been
easy
to
forget
the
danger
the
creaking
of
the
ship
and
the
incessant
roar
of
the
water
were
enough
for
wakefulness
with
each
lurch
of
the
boat
it
seemed
more
incredible
that
it
could
endure
it
was
such
a
mite
of
a
thing
to
meet
so
furious
an
attack
as
it
rose
on
the
wave
to
pause
in
terror
on
its
crest
before
sinking
shivering
into
the
trough
it
made
the
breath
come
short
and
the
heart
stand
still
through
the
night
the
fragile
little
craft
fought
its
lonely
way
bravely
ignoring
its
own
weakness
and
the
infinite
strength
of
its
enemy
to
the
captain
lashed
to
the
bridge
there
were
hours
of
grave
anxiety
hours
when
he
feared
each
wave
as
it
approached
and
wondered
what
new
damage
it
had
done
as
it
receded
as
the
wind
increased
toward
morning
he
felt
a
sickening
certainty
that
the
brave
little
boat
was
beaten
somehow
she
seemed
to
lose
courage
to
waver
a
bit
and
almost
give
tip
the
fight
he
watched
her
miserably
as
the
dismal
dawn
came
up
out
of
the
sea
yet
it
was
not
until
seven
that
the
crash
came
which
shook
the
passengers
out
of
their
berths
and
filled
them
with
shivering
terror
the
whirring
of
the
broken
shaft
seemed
to
consume
the
ship
in
every
cabin
it
spoke
with
terrible
vividness
of
disaster
the
clamor
of
voices
and
the
rush
of
many
feet
which
followed
meant
but
one
thing
almost
instantly
the
machinery
was
stopped
an
ominous
silence
in
the
midst
of
the
dull
roar
of
the
water
and
the
cry
of
the
wind
it
was
a
terrified
crowd
that
quickly
gathered
in
the
main
cabin
but
it
was
a
brave
one
there
were
no
cries
and
few
tears
they
expected
anything
and
were
ready
for
the
worst
but
they
would
not
show
the
white
feather
it
was
dan
who
broke
the
tension
i
made
sure
of
my
pearls
she
said
i
thought
they
would
be
appreciated
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
brewster
came
in
upon
their
laughter
i
like
your
nerve
people
he
exclaimed
you
are
all
right
it
wo
be
so
bad
now
the
wind
has
dropped
long
afterward
when
they
talked
the
matter
over
demille
claimed
that
the
only
thing
that
bothered
him
that
night
was
the
effort
to
decide
whether
the
club
of
which
he
and
monty
were
members
would
put
in
the
main
hallway
two
cards
each
bearing
a
name
or
only
one
with
both
names
valentine
regretted
that
he
had
gone
on
for
years
paying
life
insurance
premiums
when
now
his
only
relatives
were
on
the
boat
and
would
die
with
him
the
captain
looking
pretty
rocky
after
his
hour
vigil
summoned
his
chief
we
in
a
bad
hole
brewster
he
said
when
they
were
alone
and
no
mistake
a
broken
shaft
and
this
weather
make
a
pretty
poor
combination
is
there
no
chance
of
making
a
port
for
repairs
i
do
see
it
sir
it
looks
like
a
long
pull
we
are
way
off
our
course
i
suppose
and
monty
coolness
won
captain
perry
admiration
i
ca
tell
just
how
much
until
i
get
the
sun
but
this
wind
is
hell
i
suspect
we
drifted
pretty
far
come
and
get
some
coffee
captain
while
the
storm
lasts
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
cheer
up
the
women
and
trust
to
luck
you
the
nerviest
mate
i
ever
shipped
with
brewster
and
the
captain
hand
gripped
monty
in
a
way
that
meant
things
it
was
a
tribute
he
appreciated
during
the
day
monty
devoted
himself
to
his
guests
and
at
the
first
sign
of
pensiveness
he
was
ready
with
a
jest
or
a
story
but
he
did
it
all
with
a
tact
that
inspired
the
crowd
as
a
whole
with
hope
and
no
one
suspected
that
he
himself
was
not
cheerful
for
peggy
gray
there
was
a
special
tenderness
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
things
should
go
wrong
he
would
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
it
could
do
no
harm
he
thought
to
himself
and
i
want
her
to
know
toward
night
the
worst
was
over
the
sea
had
gone
down
and
the
hatches
were
opened
for
a
while
to
admit
air
though
it
was
still
too
rough
to
venture
out
the
next
morning
was
bright
and
clear
when
the
company
gathered
on
deck
the
havoc
created
by
the
storm
was
apparent
two
of
the
boats
had
been
completely
carried
away
and
the
launch
was
rendered
useless
by
a
large
hole
in
the
stern
you
do
mean
to
say
that
we
will
drift
about
until
the
repairs
can
be
made
asked
dan
in
alarm
we
are
three
hundred
miles
off
the
course
already
explained
monty
and
it
will
be
pretty
slow
traveling
under
sail
it
was
decided
to
make
for
the
canary
islands
where
repairs
could
be
made
and
the
voyage
resumed
but
where
the
wind
had
raged
a
few
days
before
it
had
now
disappeared
altogether
and
for
a
week
the
flitter
tossed
about
absolutely
unable
to
make
headway
the
first
of
august
had
arrived
and
monty
himself
was
beginning
to
be
nervous
with
the
fatal
day
not
quite
two
months
away
things
began
to
look
serious
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
would
remain
after
he
had
settled
the
expenses
of
the
cruise
and
he
was
helplessly
drifting
in
even
if
the
necessary
repairs
could
be
made
promptly
it
would
take
the
flitter
fourteen
days
to
sail
from
the
canaries
to
new
york
figure
as
hard
as
he
could
he
saw
no
way
out
of
the
unfortunate
situation
two
days
more
elapsed
and
still
no
sign
of
a
breeze
he
made
sure
that
september
would
find
him
still
drifting
and
still
in
possession
of
one
hundred
thousand
superfluous
dollars
at
the
end
of
ten
days
the
yacht
had
progressed
but
two
hundred
miles
and
monty
was
beginning
to
plan
the
rest
of
his
existence
on
a
capital
of
he
had
given
up
all
hope
of
the
sedgwick
legacy
and
was
trying
to
be
resigned
to
his
fate
when
a
tramp
steamer
was
suddenly
sighted
brewster
ordered
the
man
on
watch
to
fly
a
flag
of
distress
then
he
reported
to
the
captain
and
told
what
he
had
done
with
a
bound
the
captain
rushed
on
deck
and
tore
the
flag
from
the
sailor
hand
that
was
my
order
said
monty
nettled
at
the
captain
manner
you
want
them
to
get
a
line
on
us
and
claim
salvage
do
you
what
do
you
mean
if
they
get
a
line
on
us
in
response
to
that
flag
they
will
claim
the
entire
value
of
the
ship
as
salvage
you
want
to
spend
another
on
this
boat
i
did
understand
said
monty
sheepishly
but
for
god
sake
fix
it
up
somehow
ca
they
tow
us
i
pay
for
it
communication
was
slow
but
after
an
apparently
endless
amount
of
signaling
the
captain
finally
announced
that
the
freight
steamer
was
bound
for
southampton
and
would
tow
the
flitter
to
that
point
for
a
price
back
to
southampton
groaned
monty
that
means
months
before
we
get
back
to
new
york
he
says
he
can
get
us
to
southampton
in
ten
days
interrupted
the
captain
i
can
do
it
i
can
do
it
he
cried
to
the
consternation
of
his
guests
who
wondered
if
his
mind
were
affected
if
he
land
us
in
southampton
by
the
i
pay
him
up
to
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
chapter
xxix
the
prodigal
return
after
what
seemed
an
age
to
monty
the
flitter
in
tow
of
the
freighter
glencoe
arrived
at
southampton
the
captain
of
the
freight
boat
was
a
thrifty
scotchman
whose
ship
was
traveling
with
a
light
cargo
and
he
was
not
therefore
averse
to
taking
on
a
tow
but
the
thought
of
salvage
had
caused
him
to
ask
a
high
price
for
the
service
and
monty
after
a
futile
attempt
at
bargaining
had
agreed
the
price
was
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
the
young
man
believed
more
than
ever
that
everything
was
ruled
by
a
wise
providence
which
had
not
deserted
him
his
guests
were
heartsick
when
they
heard
the
figure
but
were
as
happy
as
monty
at
the
prospect
of
reaching
land
again
the
glencoe
made
several
stops
before
southampton
was
finally
reached
on
the
of
august
but
when
the
english
coast
was
sighted
every
one
was
too
eager
to
go
ashore
to
begrudge
the
extra
day
dan
demille
asked
the
entire
party
to
become
his
guests
for
a
week
shooting
trip
in
scotland
but
monty
vetoed
the
plan
in
the
most
decided
manner
we
sail
for
new
york
on
the
fastest
boat
said
monty
and
hurried
off
to
learn
the
sailings
and
book
his
party
the
first
boat
was
to
sail
on
the
and
he
could
only
secure
accommodations
for
twelve
of
his
guests
the
rest
were
obliged
to
follow
a
week
later
this
was
readily
agreed
to
and
bragdon
was
left
to
see
to
the
necessary
repairs
on
the
flitter
and
arrange
for
her
homeward
voyage
monty
gave
bragdon
fifteen
thousand
dollars
for
the
purpose
and
extracted
a
solemn
promise
that
the
entire
amount
would
be
used
but
it
wo
cost
half
of
this
protested
bragdon
you
will
have
to
give
these
people
a
good
time
during
the
week
and
well
you
have
promised
that
i
shall
never
see
another
penny
of
it
some
day
you
know
why
i
do
this
and
monty
felt
easier
when
his
friend
agreed
to
abide
by
his
wishes
he
discharged
the
flitter
crew
with
five
months
pay
and
the
reward
promised
on
the
night
of
peggy
rescue
which
was
productive
of
touching
emotions
captain
perry
and
his
officers
never
forgot
the
farewell
of
the
prodigal
nor
could
they
hide
the
regret
that
marked
their
faces
plans
to
dispose
of
his
household
goods
and
the
balance
of
his
cash
in
the
short
time
that
would
be
left
after
he
arrived
in
new
york
occupied
monty
attention
and
most
men
would
have
given
up
the
scheme
as
hopeless
but
he
did
not
despair
he
was
still
game
and
he
prepared
for
the
final
plunge
with
grim
determination
there
should
have
been
a
clause
in
jones
conditions
about
permitting
he
said
to
himself
a
shipwrecked
mariner
should
not
be
expected
to
spend
a
million
dollars
the
division
of
the
party
for
the
two
sailings
was
tactfully
arranged
by
dan
demille
the
valentines
chaperoned
the
second
table
as
subway
smith
called
those
who
were
to
take
the
later
boat
and
she
herself
looked
after
the
first
lot
peggy
gray
and
monty
brewster
were
in
the
demille
party
the
three
days
in
england
were
marked
by
unparalleled
extravagance
on
monty
part
one
of
the
local
hotels
was
subsidized
for
a
week
although
the
party
only
stayed
for
luncheon
and
the
cecil
in
london
was
a
gainer
by
several
thousand
dollars
for
the
brief
stop
there
it
was
a
careworn
little
band
that
took
special
train
for
southampton
and
embarked
two
days
later
the
rest
cure
that
followed
was
welcome
to
all
of
them
and
brewster
was
especially
glad
that
his
race
was
almost
run
swiftly
and
steadily
the
liner
cut
down
the
leagues
that
separated
her
from
new
york
fair
weather
and
fair
cheer
marked
her
course
and
the
soft
balmy
nights
were
like
seasons
of
fairyland
monty
was
cherishing
in
his
heart
the
hope
inspired
by
peggy
action
on
the
night
of
the
storm
somehow
it
brought
a
small
ray
of
light
to
his
clouded
understanding
and
he
found
joy
in
keeping
the
flame
alive
religiously
if
somewhat
doubtfully
his
eyes
followed
her
constantly
searching
for
the
encouragement
that
the
very
blindness
of
love
had
hidden
from
him
forever
tormenting
himself
with
fears
and
hopes
and
fears
again
her
happiness
and
vivacity
puzzled
him
he
was
often
annoyed
he
was
now
and
then
seriously
mystified
four
days
out
from
new
york
then
three
days
then
two
days
and
then
brewster
began
to
feel
the
beginning
of
the
final
whirlwind
in
profligacy
clouding
him
oppressively
ominously
unkindly
down
in
his
stateroom
he
drew
new
estimates
new
calculations
and
tried
to
balance
the
old
ones
so
that
they
appeared
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
his
designs
going
over
the
statistics
carefully
he
estimated
that
the
cruise
including
the
repairs
and
return
of
the
yacht
to
new
york
would
cost
him
in
round
figures
one
hundred
and
days
marked
the
length
of
the
voyage
when
reckoned
by
time
and
as
near
as
he
could
get
at
it
the
expense
had
averaged
a
day
according
to
the
contract
he
was
to
pay
for
the
yacht
exclusive
of
the
cuisine
and
personal
service
and
he
had
found
it
simple
enough
to
spend
the
remaining
there
were
days
of
course
when
fully
disappeared
and
there
were
others
on
which
he
spent
much
less
than
but
the
average
was
secure
taking
everything
into
consideration
brewster
found
that
his
fortune
had
dwindled
to
a
few
paltry
thousands
in
addition
to
the
proceeds
which
would
come
to
him
from
the
sale
of
his
furniture
on
the
whole
he
was
satisfied
the
landing
in
new
york
and
the
separation
which
followed
were
not
entirely
merry
every
discomfort
was
forgotten
and
the
travelers
only
knew
that
the
most
wonderful
cruise
since
that
of
the
ark
had
come
to
an
end
there
was
not
one
who
would
not
have
been
glad
to
begin
it
again
the
next
day
immediately
after
the
landing
brewster
and
gardner
were
busy
with
the
details
of
settlement
after
clearing
up
all
of
the
obligations
arising
from
the
cruise
they
felt
the
appropriateness
of
a
season
of
reflection
it
was
a
difficult
moment
a
moment
when
undelivered
reproofs
were
in
the
air
but
gardner
seemed
much
the
more
melancholy
of
the
two
piles
of
newspapers
lay
scattered
about
the
floor
of
the
room
in
which
they
sat
every
one
of
them
contained
sensational
stories
of
the
prodigal
trip
with
pictures
incidents
and
predictions
monty
was
pained
humiliated
and
resentful
but
he
was
honest
enough
to
admit
the
justification
of
much
that
was
said
of
him
he
read
bits
of
it
here
and
there
and
then
threw
the
papers
aside
hopelessly
in
a
few
weeks
they
would
tell
another
story
and
quite
as
emphatically
the
worst
of
it
monty
is
that
you
are
the
next
thing
to
being
a
poor
man
groaned
gardner
i
done
my
best
to
economize
for
you
here
at
home
as
you
see
by
these
figures
but
nothing
could
possibly
balance
the
extravagances
of
this
voyage
they
are
simply
appalling
with
the
condemnation
of
his
friends
ringing
in
his
troubled
brain
with
the
sneers
of
acquaintances
to
distress
his
pride
with
the
jibes
of
the
comic
papers
to
torture
him
remorselessly
brewster
was
fast
becoming
the
most
miserable
man
in
new
york
friends
of
former
days
gave
him
the
cut
direct
clubmen
ignored
him
or
scorned
him
openly
women
chilled
him
with
the
iciness
of
unspoken
reproof
and
all
the
world
was
hung
with
shadows
the
doggedness
of
despair
kept
him
up
but
the
strain
that
pulled
down
on
him
was
so
relentless
that
the
struggle
was
losing
its
equality
he
had
not
expected
such
a
compared
with
his
former
self
monty
was
now
almost
a
physical
wreck
haggard
thin
and
defiant
a
shadow
of
the
once
debonair
young
new
yorker
an
object
of
pity
and
scorn
ashamed
and
despairing
he
had
almost
lacked
the
courage
to
face
gray
the
consolation
he
once
gained
through
her
he
now
denied
himself
and
his
suffering
peculiar
as
it
was
was
very
real
in
absolute
recklessness
he
gave
dinner
after
dinner
party
after
party
all
on
a
most
lavish
scale
many
of
his
guests
laughing
at
him
openly
while
they
enjoyed
his
hospitality
the
real
friends
remonstrated
pleaded
did
everything
within
their
power
to
check
his
awful
rush
to
poverty
but
without
success
he
was
not
to
be
stopped
at
last
the
furniture
began
to
go
then
the
plate
then
ail
the
priceless
piece
by
piece
it
disappeared
until
the
apartments
were
empty
and
he
had
squandered
almost
all
of
the
arising
from
the
sales
the
servants
were
paid
off
the
apartments
relinquished
and
he
was
beginning
to
know
what
it
meant
to
be
on
his
uppers
at
the
banks
he
ascertained
that
the
interest
on
his
moneys
amounted
to
a
week
before
the
of
september
the
whole
million
was
gone
including
the
amounts
won
in
lumber
and
fuel
and
other
luckless
enterprises
he
still
had
about
of
his
interest
money
in
the
banks
but
he
had
a
billion
pangs
in
his
heart
the
interest
on
his
improvidence
he
found
some
delight
in
the
discovery
that
the
servants
had
robbed
him
of
not
less
than
worth
of
his
belongings
including
the
christmas
presents
that
he
in
honor
could
not
have
sold
his
only
encouragement
came
from
grant
ripley
the
lawyers
they
inspired
confidence
in
his
lagging
brain
by
urging
him
on
to
the
end
promising
brightness
thereafter
swearengen
jones
was
as
mute
as
the
mountains
in
which
he
lived
there
was
no
word
from
him
there
was
no
assurance
that
he
would
approve
of
what
had
been
done
to
obliterate
edwin
peter
brewster
legacy
dan
demille
and
his
wife
implored
monty
to
come
with
them
to
the
mountains
before
his
substance
was
gone
completely
the
former
offered
him
money
employment
rest
and
security
if
he
would
abandon
the
course
he
was
pursuing
up
in
fortieth
street
peggy
gray
was
grieving
her
heart
out
and
he
knew
it
two
or
three
of
those
whom
he
had
considered
friends
refused
to
recognize
him
in
the
street
in
this
last
trying
week
and
it
did
not
even
interest
him
to
learn
that
miss
barbara
drew
was
to
become
a
duchess
before
the
winter
was
gone
yet
he
found
some
satisfaction
in
the
report
that
one
hampton
of
chicago
had
long
since
been
dropped
out
of
the
race
one
day
he
implored
the
faithful
bragdon
to
steal
the
boston
terriers
he
could
not
and
would
not
sell
them
and
he
dared
not
give
them
away
bragdon
dejectedly
appropriated
the
dogs
and
brewster
announced
that
some
day
he
would
offer
a
reward
for
their
return
and
no
questions
asked
he
took
a
suite
of
rooms
in
a
small
hotel
and
was
feverishly
planning
the
overthrow
of
the
last
torturing
thousands
bragdon
lived
with
him
and
the
little
sons
of
the
rich
stood
loyally
ready
to
help
him
when
he
uttered
the
first
cry
of
want
but
even
this
establishment
had
to
be
abandoned
at
last
the
old
rooms
in
fortieth
street
were
still
open
to
him
and
though
he
quailed
at
the
thought
of
making
them
a
refuge
he
faced
the
ordeal
in
the
spirit
of
a
martyr
chapter

the
promise
of
thrift
monty
you
are
breaking
my
heart
was
the
first
and
only
appeal
gray
ever
made
to
him
it
was
two
days
before
the
and
it
did
not
come
until
after
the
store
men
had
driven
away
from
her
door
with
the
bulk
of
his
clothing
in
their
wagon
she
and
peggy
had
seen
little
of
brewster
and
his
nervous
restlessness
alarmed
them
his
return
was
the
talk
of
the
town
men
tried
to
shun
him
but
he
persistently
wasted
some
portion
of
his
fortune
on
his
unwilling
subjects
when
he
gave
in
cash
to
a
home
for
newsboys
even
his
friends
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
mad
it
was
his
only
gift
to
charity
and
he
excused
his
motive
in
giving
at
this
time
by
recalling
sedgwick
injunction
to
give
sparingly
to
charity
everything
was
gone
from
his
thoughts
but
the
overpowering
eagerness
to
get
rid
of
a
few
troublesome
thousands
he
felt
like
an
outcast
a
pariah
a
hated
object
that
infected
every
one
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
sleep
was
almost
impossible
eating
was
a
farce
he
gave
elaborate
suppers
which
he
did
not
touch
already
his
best
friends
were
discussing
the
advisability
of
putting
him
in
a
sanitarium
where
his
mind
might
be
preserved
his
case
was
looked
upon
as
peculiar
in
the
history
of
mankind
no
writer
could
find
a

gray
met
him
in
the
hallway
of
her
home
as
he
was
nervously
pocketing
the
he
had
received
in
payment
for
his
clothes
her
face
was
like
that
of
a
ghost
he
tried
to
answer
her
reproof
but
the
words
would
not
come
and
he
fled
to
his
room
locking
the
door
after
him
he
was
at
work
there
on
the
transaction
that
was
to
record
the
total
disappearance
of
edwin
brewster
million
his
final
report
to
swearengen
jones
executor
of
james
sedgwick
will
on
the
floor
were
bundles
of
packages
carefully
wrapped
and
tied
and
on
the
table
was
the
long
sheet
of
white
paper
on
which
the
report
was
being
drawn
the
package
contained
receipts
thousands
upon
thousands
of
them
for
the
dollars
he
had
spent
in
less
than
a
year
they
were
there
for
the
inspection
of
swearengen
jones
faithfully
and
honorably
kept
as
if
the
old
westerner
would
go
over
in
detail
the
countless
documents
he
had
the
accounts
balanced
up
to
the
hour
on
the
long
sheet
lay
the
record
of
his
ruthlessness
the
epitaph
of
a
million
in
his
pocket
was
exactly
this
was
to
last
him
for
less
than
hours
and
then
it
would
go
to
join
the
rest
it
was
his
plan
to
visit
grant
ripley
on
the
afternoon
of
the
and
to
read
the
report
to
them
in
anticipation
of
the
meeting
with
jones
on
the
day
following
just
before
noon
after
his
encounter
with
gray
he
came
down
stairs
and
boldly
for
the
first
time
in
days
sought
out
peggy
there
was
the
old
smile
in
his
eye
and
the
old
heartiness
in
his
voice
when
he
came
upon
her
in
the
library
she
was
not
reading
books
pleasures
and
all
the
joys
of
life
had
fled
from
her
mind
and
she
thought
only
of
the
disaster
that
was
coming
to
the
boy
she
had
always
loved
his
heart
smote
him
as
he
looked
into
the
deep
somber
frightened
eyes
running
over
with
love
and
fear
for
him
peggy
do
you
think
i
worth
anything
more
from
your
mother
do
you
think
she
will
ask
me
to
live
here
any
longer
he
asked
steadily
taking
her
hand
in
his
hers
was
cold
his
as
hot
as
fire
you
know
what
you
said
away
off
yonder
somewhere
that
she
let
me
live
here
if
i
deserved
it
i
am
a
pauper
peggy
and
i
afraid
i
i
may
have
to
get
down
to
drudgery
again
will
she
turn
me
out
you
know
i
must
have
somewhere
to
live
shall
it
be
the
poorhouse
do
you
remember
saying
one
day
that
i
end
in
the
poorhouse
she
was
looking
into
his
eyes
dreading
what
might
be
seen
in
them
but
there
was
no
gleam
of
insanity
there
there
was
no
fever
instead
there
was
the
quiet
smile
of
the
man
who
is
satisfied
with
himself
and
the
world
his
voice
bore
traces
of
emotion
but
it
was
the
voice
of
one
who
has
perfect
control
of
his
wits
is
it
all
gone
monty
she
asked
almost
in
a
whisper
here
is
the
residue
of
my
estate
he
said
opening
his
purse
with
steady
fingers
i
back
to
where
i
left
off
a
year
ago
the
million
is
gone
and
my
wings
are
clipped
her
face
was
white
her
heart
was
in
the
clutch
of
ice
how
could
he
be
so
calm
about
it
when
for
him
she
was
suffering
such
agony
twice
she
started
to
speak
but
her
voice
failed
her
she
turned
slowly
and
walked
to
the
window
keeping
her
back
to
the
man
who
smiled
so
sadly
and
yet
so
heartlessly
i
did
want
the
million
peggy
he
went
on
you
think
as
the
rest
do
i
know
that
i
was
a
fool
to
act
as
i
did
it
would
be
rank
idiocy
on
my
part
to
blame
you
any
more
than
the
others
for
thinking
as
you
do
appearances
are
against
me
the
proof
is
overwhelming
a
year
ago
i
was
called
a
man
they
are
stripping
me
of
every
claim
to
that
distinction
the
world
says
i
am
a
fool
a
dolt
almost
a
criminal
but
no
one
believes
i
am
a
man
peggy
will
you
feel
better
toward
me
if
i
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
begin
life
all
over
again
it
will
be
a
new
monty
brewster
that
starts
out
again
in
a
few
days
or
if
you
will
it
shall
be
the
old
one
the
monty
you
once
knew
the
old
monty
she
murmured
softly
dreamily
it
would
be
good
to
see
him
so
much
better
than
to
see
the
monty
of
the
last
year
and
in
spite
of
all
i
have
done
peggy
you
will
stand
by
me
you
wo
desert
me
like
the
rest
you
be
the
same
peggy
of
the
other
days
he
cried
his
calmness
breaking
down
how
can
you
ask
why
should
you
doubt
me
for
a
moment
they
stood
silent
each
looking
into
the
heart
of
the
other
each
seeing
the
beginning
of
a
new
day
child
his
voice
trembled
dangerously
i
i
wonder
if
you
care
enough
for
me
to
to
but
he
could
only
look
the
question
to
start
all
over
again
with
you
she
whispered
yes
to
trust
yourself
to
the
prodigal
who
has
returned
without
you
child
all
the
rest
would
be
as
the
husks
peggy
i
want
you
you
you
do
love
me
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
i
can
feel
it
in
your
presence
how
long
you
have
been
in
realizing
it
she
said
pensively
as
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
for
many
minutes
he
held
her
close
finding
a
beautiful
peace
in
the
world
again
how
long
have
you
really
cared
he
asked
in
a
whisper
always
monty
all
my
life
and
i
too
child
all
my
life
i
know
it
now
i
known
it
for
months
oh
what
a
fool
i
was
to
have
wasted
all
this
love
of
yours
and
all
this
love
of
mine
but
i
not
be
a
profligate
in
love
peggy
i
not
squander
an
atom
of
it
dear
not
as
long
as
i
live
and
we
will
build
a
greater
love
monty
as
we
build
the
new
life
together
we
never
can
be
poor
while
we
have
love
as
a
treasure
you
wo
mind
being
poor
with
me
he
asked
i
ca
be
poor
with
you
she
said
simply
and
i
might
have
let
all
this
escape
me
he
cried
fervently
listen
peggy
we
will
start
together
you
as
my
wife
and
my
fortune
you
shall
be
all
that
is
left
to
me
of
the
past
will
you
marry
me
the
day
after
do
say
no
dearest
i
want
to
begin
on
that
day
at
seven
in
the
morning
dear
do
you
see
how
good
the
start
will
be
and
he
pleaded
so
ardently
and
so
earnestly
that
he
won
his
point
even
though
it
grew
out
of
a
whim
that
she
could
not
then
understand
she
was
not
to
learn
until
afterward
his
object
in
having
the
marriage
take
place
on
the
morning
of
september
two
hours
before
the
time
set
for
the
turning
over
of
the
sedgwick
millions
if
all
went
well
they
would
be
brewster
millions
before
twelve
and
peggy
life
of
poverty
would
cover
no
more
than
three
hours
of
time
she
believed
him
worth
a
lifetime
of
poverty
so
they
would
start
the
new
life
with
but
one
possession
love
peggy
rebelled
against
his
desire
to
spend
the
seventy
dollars
that
still
remained
but
he
was
firm
in
his
determination
they
would
dine
and
drive
together
and
see
all
of
the
old
life
that
was
left
on
seventy
dollars
then
on
the
next
day
they
would
start
all
over
again
there
was
one
rude
moment
of
dismay
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
peggy
might
be
considered
an
asset
if
she
became
his
wife
before
nine
but
he
realized
at
once
that
it
was
only
demanded
of
him
that
he
be
penniless
and
that
he
possess
no
object
that
had
been
acquired
through
the
medium
of
edwin
peter
brewster
money
surely
this
wife
who
was
not
to
come
to
him
until
his
last
dollar
was
gone
could
not
be
the
product
of
an
old
man
legacy
but
so
careful
was
he
in
regard
to
the
transaction
that
he
decided
to
borrow
money
of
joe
bragdon
to
buy
the
license
and
to
pay
the
minister
fee
not
only
would
he
be
penniless
on
the
day
of
settlement
but
he
would
be
in
debt
so
changed
was
the
color
of
the
world
to
him
now
that
even
the
failure
to
win
sedgwick
millions
could
not
crush
out
the
new
life
and
the
new
joy
that
had
come
to
him
with
the
winning
of
peggy
gray
chapter
xxxi
how
the
million
disappeared
soon
after
noon
on
the
of
september
monty
folded
his
report
to
swearengen
jones
stuck
it
into
his
pocket
and
sallied
forth
a
parcel
delivery
wagon
had
carried
off
a
mysterious
bundle
a
few
minutes
before
gray
could
not
conceal
her
wonder
but
brewster
answers
to
her
questions
threw
little
light
on
the
mystery
he
could
not
tell
her
the
big
bundle
contained
the
receipts
that
were
to
prove
his
sincerity
when
the
time
came
to
settle
with
jones
brewster
had
used
his
own
form
of
receipt
for
every
purchase
the
little
stub
receipt
books
had
been
made
to
order
for
him
and
not
only
he
but
every
person
in
his
employ
carried
one
everywhere
no
matter
how
trivial
the
purchase
the
person
who
received
a
dollar
of
brewster
money
signed
a
receipt
for
the
amount
newsboys
and
bootblacks
were
the
only
beings
who
escaped
the
formality
tips
to
waiters
porters
cabbies
were
recorded
and
afterward
put
into
a
class
by
themselves
receipts
for
the
few
dollars
remaining
in
his
possession
were
to
be
turned
over
on
the
morning
of
the
and
the
general
report
was
not
to
be
completed
until
on
that
day
he
kissed
peggy
told
her
to
be
ready
for
a
drive
at
and
then
went
off
to
find
joe
bragdon
and
elon
gardner
they
met
him
by
appointment
and
to
them
he
confided
his
design
to
be
married
on
the
following
day
you
ca
afford
it
monty
exploded
joe
fearlessly
peggy
is
too
good
a
girl
by
gad
it
is
fair
to
her
we
have
agreed
to
begin
life
wait
and
see
the
result
i
think
it
will
surprise
you
incidentally
it
is
up
to
me
to
get
the
license
and
to
engage
a
minister
services
it
going
to
be
quiet
you
know
joe
you
can
be
my
best
man
if
you
like
and
gardie
i
expect
you
to
sign
your
name
as
one
of
the
witnesses
evening
we
have
supper
at
gray
and
those
present
will
not
comprise
a
very
large
list
i
assure
you
but
we
talk
about
that
later
on
just
now
i
want
to
ask
you
fellows
to
lend
me
enough
money
to
get
the
license
and
pay
the
preacher
i
return
it
afternoon
well
i
damned
exclaimed
gardner
utterly
dumfounded
by
the
nerve
of
the
man
but
they
went
with
him
to
get
the
license
and
bragdon
paid
for
it
gardner
promised
to
have
the
minister
at
the
gray
house
the
next
morning
monty
other
request
made
in
deep
seriousness
was
that
peggy
was
not
to
be
told
of
the
little
transaction
in
which
the
license
and
the
minister
figured
so
prominently
he
then
hurried
off
to
the
office
of
grant
ripley
the
bundles
of
receipts
had
preceded
him
has
jones
arrived
in
town
was
his
first
anxious
question
after
the
greetings
he
is
not
registered
at
any
of
the
hotels
responded
grant
and
brewster
did
not
see
the
troubled
look
that
passed
over
his
face
he
show
up
i
presume
said
he
complacently
the
lawyers
did
not
tell
him
that
all
the
telegrams
they
had
sent
to
swearengen
jones
in
the
past
two
weeks
had
been
returned
to
the
new
york
office
as
unclaimed
in
butte
the
telegraph
company
reported
that
jones
was
not
to
be
found
and
that
he
had
not
been
seen
in
butte
since
the
of
september
the
lawyers
were
hourly
expecting
word
from
montana
men
to
whom
they
had
telegraphed
for
information
and
advice
they
were
extremely
nervous
but
montgomery
brewster
was
too
eager
and
excited
to
notice
the
fact
a
tall
bearded
stranger
was
here
this
morning
asking
for
you
brewster
said
ripley
his
head
bent
over
some
papers
on
his
desk
ah
jones
i
sure
i
always
imagined
him
with
a
long
beard
said
monty
relief
in
his
voice
it
was
not
jones
we
know
jones
quite
well
this
man
was
a
stranger
and
refused
to
give
his
name
he
said
he
would
call
at
gray
this
afternoon
did
he
look
like
a
constable
or
a
asked
monty
with
a
laugh
he
looked
very
much
like
a
tramp
well
we
forget
him
for
the
time
being
said
monty
drawing
the
report
from
his
pocket
would
you
mind
looking
over
this
report
gentlemen
i
like
to
know
if
it
is
in
proper
form
to
present
to
mr
jones
grant
hand
trembled
as
he
took
the
carefully
folded
sheet
from
brewster
a
quick
glance
of
despair
passed
between
the
two
lawyers
of
course
you
understand
that
this
report
is
merely
a
synopsis
of
the
expenditures
they
are
classified
however
and
the
receipts
over
there
are
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
jones
can
very
easily
verify
all
the
figures
set
out
in
the
report
for
instance
where
it
says
i
have
put
down
the
total
amount
that
went
up
in
smoke
the
receipts
are
to
serve
as
an
itemized
statement
you
know
ripley
took
the
paper
from
his
partner
hand
and
pulling
himself
together
read
the
report
aloud
it
was

not

my

you

seemed
like
a

million
if
any

should
tell
you
that
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
waste
a
million
dollars
refer
him
to
me
last
fall
i
weighed
pounds
yesterday
i
barely
moved
the
beam
at
last
fall
there
was
not
a
wrinkle
in
my
face
nor
did
i
have
a
white
hair
you
see
the
result
of
overwork
gentlemen
it
will
take
an
age
to
get
back
to
where
i
was
physically
but
i
think
i
can
do
it
with
the
vacation
that
begins
incidentally
i
going
to
be
married
morning
just
when
i
am
poorer
than
i
ever
expect
to
be
again
i
still
have
a
few
dollars
to
spend
and
i
must
be
about
it
i
will
account
for
what
i
spend
this
evening
it
is
now
covered
by
the
item
but
i
have
the
receipts
to
show
all
right
see
you
morning
he
was
gone
eager
to
be
with
peggy
afraid
to
discuss
his
report
with
the
lawyers
grant
and
ripley
shook
their
heads
and
sat
silent
for
a
long
time
after
his
departure
we
ought
to
hear
something
definite
before
night
said
grant
but
there
was
anxiety
in
his
voice
i
wonder
mused
ripley
as
if
to
himself
how
he
will
take
it
if
the
worst
should
happen
chapter
xxxii
the
night
before
it
all
up
to
jones
now
kept
running
through
brewster
brain
as
he
drove
off
to
keep
his
appointment
with
peggy
gray
the
million
is
gone
all
gone
i
as
poor
as
job
turkey
it
up
to
jones
but
i
do
see
how
he
can
decide
against
me
he
insisted
on
making
a
pauper
of
me
and
he
ca
have
the
heart
to
throw
me
down
now
but
what
if
he
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
be
ugly
i
wonder
if
i
could
break
the
will
i
wonder
if
i
could
beat
him
out
in
court
peggy
was
waiting
for
him
her
cheeks
were
flushed
as
with
a
fever
she
had
caught
from
him
the
mad
excitement
of
the
occasion
come
peggy
he
exclaimed
eagerly
this
is
our
last
holiday
be
merry
we
can
forget
it
if
you
like
when
we
begin
all
over
again
but
maybe
it
will
be
worth
remembering
he
assisted
her
to
the
seat
and
then
leaped
up
beside
her
we
off
he
cried
his
voice
quivering
it
is
absolute
madness
dear
she
said
but
her
eyes
were
sparkling
with
the
joy
of
recklessness
away
went
the
trap
and
the
two
light
hearts
gray
turned
from
a
window
in
the
house
with
tears
in
her
eyes
to
her
troubled
mind
they
were
driving
off
into
utter
darkness
the
queerest
looking
man
came
to
the
house
to
see
you
this
afternoon
monty
said
peggy
he
wore
a
beard
and
he
made
me
think
of
one
of
remington
cowboys
what
was
his
name
he
told
the
maid
it
did
not
matter
i
saw
him
as
he
walked
away
and
he
looked
very
much
a
man
he
said
he
would
come
if
he
did
not
find
you
down
town
do
you
recognize
him
from
the
description
not
at
all
ca
imagine
who
he
is
monty
she
said
after
a
moment
painful
reflection
he
he
could
have
been
a
i
know
what
you
mean
an
officer
sent
up
to
attach
my
belongings
or
something
of
the
sort
no
dearest
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
i
do
not
owe
a
dollar
in
the
world
then
he
recalled
his
peculiar
indebtedness
to
bragdon
and
gardner
except
one
or
two
very
small
personal
obligations
he
added
hastily
do
worry
about
it
dear
we
are
out
for
a
good
time
and
we
must
make
the
most
of
it
first
we
drive
through
the
park
then
we
dine
at
sherry
but
we
must
dress
for
that
dear
she
cried
and
the
chaperon
he
turned
very
red
when
she
spoke
of
dressing
i
ashamed
to
confess
it
peggy
but
i
have
no
other
clothes
than
these
i
wearing
now
do
look
so
hurt
dear
i
going
to
leave
an
order
for
new
evening
clothes
if
i
have
the
time
and
about
the
chaperon
people
wo
be
talking
before
and
by
that
time
no
monty
sherry
is
out
of
the
question
we
ca
go
there
she
said
decisively
oh
peggy
that
spoils
everything
he
cried
in
deep
disappointment
it
is
fair
to
me
monty
everybody
would
know
us
and
every
tongue
would
wag
they
would
say
are
monty
brewster
and
margaret
gray
spending
his
last
few
dollars
on
her
you
would
have
them
think
that
he
saw
the
justice
in
her
protest
a
quiet
little
dinner
in
some
out
of
the
way
place
would
be
joyous
she
added
persuasively
you
right
peggy
you
always
right
you
see
i
so
used
to
spending
money
by
the
handful
that
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
any
other
way
i
believe
i
let
you
carry
the
pocketbook
after
let
me
think
i
knew
a
nice
little
restaurant
down
town
we
go
there
and
then
to
the
theater
dan
demille
and
his
wife
are
to
be
in
my
box
and
we
all
going
up
to
pettingill
studio
afterward
i
to
give
the
sons
a
farewell
supper
if
my
calculations
do
go
wrong
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
jaunt
and
we
go
home
happy
at
eleven
pettingill
studio
opened
its
doors
to
the
little
sons
and
their
guests
and
the
last
dutch
lunch
was
soon
under
way
brewster
had
paid
for
it
early
in
the
evening
and
when
he
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
there
was
not
a
penny
in
his
pockets
a
year
ago
at
the
same
hour
he
and
the
little
sons
were
having
a
birthday
feast
a
million
dollars
came
to
him
on
that
night
he
was
poorer
by
far
than
on
the
other
occasion
but
he
expected
a
little
gift
on
the
new
anniversary
around
the
board
besides
the
nine
little
sons
sat
six
guests
among
them
the
demilles
peggy
gray
and
mary
valentine
nopper
harrison
was
the
only
absent
little
son
and
his
health
was
proposed
by
brewster
almost
before
the
echoes
of
the
toast
to
the
bride
and
groom
died
away
interruption
came
earlier
on
this
occasion
than
it
did
that
night
a
year
ago
ellis
did
not
deliver
his
message
to
brewster
until
three
in
the
morning
but
the
boy
who
rang
the
bell
at
pettingill
a
year
later
handed
him
a
telegram
before
twelve
congratulations
are
coming
in
old
man
said
demille
as
monty
looked
fearfully
at
the
little
envelope
the
boy
had
given
him
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
suggested
bragdon
by
jove
sensible
of
you
to
get
married
on
your
birthday
monty
it
saves
time
and
expense
to
your
friends
read
it
aloud
said
subway
smith
two
to
one
it
from
nopper
harrison
cried
pettingill
brewster
fingers
trembled
he
knew
not
why
as
he
opened
the
envelope
there
was
the
most
desolate
feeling
in
his
heart
the
most
ghastly
premonition
that
had
come
in
this
last
hour
he
drew
forth
the
telegram
and
slowly
painfully
unfolded
it
no
one
could
have
told
by
his
expression
that
he
felt
almost
that
he
was
reading
his
death
warrant
it
was
from
grant
ripley
and
evidently
had
been
following
him
about
town
for
two
or
three
hours
the
lawyers
had
filed
it
at
he
read
it
at
a
glance
his
eyes
burning
his
heart
freezing
to
the
end
of
his
days
these
words
lived
sharp
and
distinct
in
his
brain
come
to
the
office
immediately
will
wait
all
night
for
you
if
necessary
jones
has
disappeared
and
there
is
absolutely
no
trace
of
him
grant
ripley
brewster
sat
as
one
paralyzed
absolutely
no
sign
of
emotion
in
his
face
the
others
began
to
clamor
for
the
contents
of
the
telegram
but
his
tongue
was
stiff
and
motionless
his
ears
deaf
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
body
was
stilled
by
the
shock
every
sense
given
him
by
the
creator
was
centered
upon
eleven
words
in
the
handwriting
of
a
careless
telegraph
operator
jones
has
disappeared
and
there
is
absolutely
no
trace
of
him
jones
has
disappeared
those
were
the
words
plain
and
terrible
in
their
clearness
tremendous
in
their
brutality
slowly
the
rest
of
the
message
began
to
urge
its
claims
upon
his
brain
come
to
our
office
immediately
and
will
wait
all
night
battled
for
recognition
he
was
calm
because
he
had
not
the
power
to
express
an
emotion
how
he
maintained
control
of
himself
afterward
he
never
knew
some
powerful
kindly
force
asserted
itself
coming
to
his
relief
with
the
timeliness
of
a
genii
gradually
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
the
others
were
waiting
for
him
to
read
the
message
aloud
he
was
not
sure
that
a
sound
would
come
forth
when
he
opened
his
lips
to
speak
but
the
tones
were
steady
natural
and
as
cold
as
steel
i
am
sorry
i
ca
tell
you
about
this
he
said
so
gravely
that
his
hearers
were
silenced
it
is
a
business
matter
of
such
vital
importance
that
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
for
an
hour
or
so
i
will
explain
everything
please
do
be
uneasy
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
grace
the
board
of
an
absent
host
i
be
most
grateful
it
is
imperative
that
i
go
and
at
once
i
promise
to
return
in
an
hour
he
was
standing
his
knees
as
stiff
as
iron
is
it
anything
serious
asked
demille
what
has
anything
happened
came
in
halting
frightened
tones
from
peggy
it
concerns
me
alone
and
it
is
purely
of
a
business
nature
seriously
i
ca
delay
going
for
another
minute
it
is
vital
in
an
hour
i
return
peggy
do
be
worried
do
be
distressed
about
me
go
on
and
have
a
good
time
everybody
and
you
find
me
the
jolliest
fellow
of
all
when
i
come
back
it
twelve
i
be
here
by
one
on
the
of
september
let
me
go
with
you
pleaded
peggy
tremulously
as
she
followed
him
into
the
hallway
i
must
go
alone
he
answered
do
worry
little
woman
it
will
be
all
right
his
kiss
sent
a
chill
to
the
very
bottom
of
peggy
heart
chapter
xxxiii
the
flight
of
jones
everything
seemed
like
a
dream
to
brewster
as
he
rushed
off
through
the
night
to
the
office
of
grant
ripley
he
was
dazed
bewildered
hardly
more
than
a
bitter
smile
crept
about
his
lips
as
he
drew
away
from
the
track
almost
as
his
hand
touched
the
rail
of
a
car
he
had
signaled
he
remembered
that
he
did
not
have
money
enough
to
pay
his
fare
it
was
six
or
seven
blocks
to
the
office
of
the
lawyers
and
he
was
actually
running
before
he
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
the
big
building
never
had
an
elevator
traveled
more
slowly
than
the
one
which
shot
him
to
the
seventh
floor
a
light
shone
through
the
transom
above
the
attorneys
door
and
he
entered
without
so
much
as
a
rap
on
the
panel
grant
who
was
pacing
the
floor
came
to
a
standstill
and
faced
his
visitor
close
the
door
please
came
in
steady
tones
from
ripley
grant
dropped
into
a
chair
and
brewster
mechanically
slammed
the
door
is
it
true
he
demanded
hoarsely
his
hand
still
on
the
knob
sit
down
brewster
and
control
yourself
said
ripley
good
god
man
ca
you
see
i
am
calm
cried
monty
go
on
tell
me
all
about
it
what
do
you
know
what
have
you
heard
he
can
not
be
found
that
all
announced
ripley
with
deadly
intentness
i
do
know
what
it
means
there
is
no
explanation
the
whole
thing
is
inconceivable
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
as
quickly
as
possible
there
is
much
to
tell
said
grant
mechanically
i
can
take
it
better
standing
declared
brewster
shutting
his
jaws
tightly
jones
was
last
seen
in
butte
on
the
third
of
this
month
said
ripley
we
sent
several
telegrams
to
him
after
that
day
asking
when
he
expected
to
leave
for
new
york
they
never
were
claimed
and
the
telegraph
company
reported
that
he
could
not
be
found
we
thought
he
might
have
gone
off
to
look
after
some
of
his
property
and
were
not
uneasy
finally
we
began
to
wonder
why
he
had
not
wired
us
on
leaving
for
the
east
i
telegraphed
him
again
and
got
no
answer
it
dawned
upon
us
that
this
was
something
unusual
we
wired
his
secretary
and
received
a
response
from
the
chief
of
police
he
asked
in
turn
if
we
could
tell
him
anything
about
the
whereabouts
of
jones
this
naturally
alarmed
us
and
yesterday
we
kept
the
wires
hot
the
result
of
our
inquiries
is
terrible
mr
brewster
why
did
you
tell
me
asked
brewster
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
jones
has
fled
accompanied
by
his
secretary
the
belief
in
butte
is
that
the
secretary
has
murdered
him
god
was
the
only
sound
that
came
from
the
lips
of
brewster
ripley
moistened
his
lips
and
went
on
we
have
dispatches
here
from
the
police
the
banks
the
trust
companies
and
from
a
half
dozen
mine
managers
you
may
read
them
if
you
like
but
i
can
tell
you
what
they
say
about
the
first
of
this
month
jones
began
to
turn
various
securities
into
money
it
is
now
known
that
they
were
once
the
property
of
james
sedgwick
held
in
trust
for
you
the
safety
deposit
vaults
were
afterward
visited
and
inspection
shows
that
he
removed
every
scrap
of
stock
every
bond
everything
of
value
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
his
own
papers
and
effects
were
not
disturbed
yours
alone
have
disappeared
it
is
this
fact
that
convinces
the
authorities
that
the
secretary
has
made
away
with
the
old
man
and
has
fled
with
the
property
the
bank
people
say
that
jones
drew
out
every
dollar
of
the
sedgwick
money
and
the
police
say
that
he
realized
tremendous
sums
on
the
convertible
securities
the
strange
part
of
it
is
that
he
sold
your
mines
and
your
real
estate
the
purchaser
being
a
man
named
golden
brewster
it
it
looks
very
much
as
if
he
had
disappeared
with
everything
brewster
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
ripley
face
throughout
the
terrible
speech
he
did
not
move
a
fraction
of
an
inch
from
the
rigid
position
assumed
at
the
beginning
is
anything
being
done
he
asked
mechanically
the
police
are
investigating
he
is
known
to
have
started
off
into
the
mountains
with
this
secretary
on
the
third
of
september
neither
has
been
seen
since
that
day
so
far
as
any
one
knows
the
earth
seems
to
have
swallowed
them
the
authorities
are
searching
the
mountains
and
are
making
every
effort
to
find
jones
or
his
body
he
is
known
to
be
eccentric
and
at
first
not
much
importance
was
attached
to
his
actions
that
is
all
we
can
tell
you
at
present
there
may
be
developments
it
looks
bad
terribly
bad
we
we
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
jones
my
god
i
wish
i
could
help
you
my
boy
i
do
blame
you
gentlemen
said
brewster
bravely
it
just
my
luck
that
all
something
told
me
all
along
that
that
it
turn
out
right
i
was
looking
for
this
kind
of
end
though
my
only
fear
was
that
jones
would
consider
me
worthy
to
receive
the
fortune
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
prove
to
be
the
the
unworthy
one
i
will
take
you
a
little
farther
into
our
confidence
brewster
said
grant
slowly
jones
notified
us
at
the
beginning
that
he
would
be
governed
largely
in
his
decision
by
our
opinion
of
your
conduct
that
is
why
we
felt
no
hesitation
in
advising
you
to
continue
as
you
were
going
while
you
were
off
at
sea
we
had
many
letters
from
him
all
in
that
sarcastic
vein
of
his
but
in
none
of
them
did
he
offer
a
word
of
criticism
he
seemed
thoroughly
satisfied
with
your
methods
in
fact
he
once
said
he
give
a
million
of
his
own
money
if
it
would
purchase
your
ability
to
spend
of
it
well
he
can
have
my
experience
free
of
charge
a
beggar
ca
be
a
chooser
you
know
said
brewster
bitterly
his
color
was
gradually
coming
back
what
do
they
know
about
the
secretary
he
asked
suddenly
intent
and
alive
he
was
a
new
one
i
understand
who
came
to
jones
less
than
a
year
ago
jones
is
said
to
have
had
implicit
faith
in
him
said
ripley
and
he
disappeared
at
the
same
time
they
were
last
seen
together
then
he
has
put
an
end
to
jones
cried
monty
excitedly
it
is
as
plain
as
day
to
me
do
you
see
that
he
exerted
some
sort
of
influence
over
the
old
man
inducing
him
to
get
all
this
money
together
on
some
pretext
or
other
solely
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
him
of
the
whole
amount
was
ever
anything
more
diabolical
he
began
pacing
the
floor
like
an
animal
nervously
clasping
and
unclasping
his
hands
we
must
catch
that
secretary
i
do
believe
jones
was
dishonest
he
has
been
duped
by
a
clever
scoundrel
the
strangest
circumstance
of
all
brewster
is
that
no
such
person
as
golden
the
purchaser
of
your
properties
can
be
found
he
is
supposed
to
reside
in
omaha
and
it
is
known
that
he
paid
nearly
three
million
dollars
for
the
property
that
now
stands
in
his
name
he
paid
it
to
jones
in
cash
too
and
he
paid
every
cent
that
the
property
is
worth
but
he
must
be
in
existence
somewhere
cried
brewster
in
perplexity
how
the
devil
could
he
pay
the
money
if
he
does
exist
i
only
know
that
no
trace
of
the
man
can
be
found
they
know
nothing
of
him
in
omaha
said
grant
helplessly
so
it
has
finally
happened
said
brewster
but
his
excitement
had
dropped
well
he
added
throwing
himself
into
a
deep
chair
it
was
always
much
too
strange
to
be
true
even
at
the
beginning
it
seemed
like
a
dream
and
now
well
now
i
am
just
awake
like
the
little
boy
after
the
i
seem
like
a
fool
to
have
taken
it
so
seriously
there
was
no
other
way
protested
ripley
you
were
quite
right
well
after
all
continued
brewster
and
the
voice
was
as
of
one
in
a
dream
perhaps
it
as
well
to
have
been
in
wonderland
even
if
you
have
to
come
down
afterward
to
the
ordinary
world
i
am
foolish
perhaps
but
even
now
i
would
not
give
it
up
then
the
thought
of
peggy
clutched
him
by
the
throat
and
he
stopped
after
a
moment
he
gathered
himself
together
and
rose
gentlemen
he
said
sharply
and
his
voice
had
changed
i
have
had
my
fun
and
this
is
the
end
of
it
down
underneath
i
am
desperately
tired
of
the
whole
thing
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
you
will
find
me
a
different
man
i
am
going
to
buckle
down
to
the
real
thing
i
am
going
to
prove
that
my
grandfather
blood
is
in
me
and
i
shall
come
out
on
top
ripley
was
obviously
moved
as
he
replied
i
do
question
it
for
a
moment
you
are
made
of
the
right
stuff
i
saw
that
long
ago
you
may
count
on
us
for
any
amount
you
need
grant
endorsed
the
opinion
i
like
your
spirit
brewster
he
said
there
are
not
many
men
who
would
have
taken
this
as
well
it
pretty
hard
on
you
too
and
it
a
miserable
wedding
gift
for
your
bride
we
may
have
important
news
from
butte
in
the
morning
said
ripley
hopefully
at
any
rate
more
of
the
details
the
newspapers
will
have
sensational
stories
no
doubt
and
we
have
asked
for
the
latest
particulars
direct
from
the
authorities
we
see
that
things
are
properly
investigated
go
home
now
my
boy
and
go
to
bed
you
will
begin
with
good
luck
on
your
side
and
you
may
be
happy
all
your
life
in
spite
of
depression
i
sure
to
be
happy
said
brewster
simply
the
ceremony
takes
place
at
seven
gentlemen
i
was
coming
to
your
office
at
nine
on
a
little
matter
of
business
but
i
fancy
it
wo
after
all
be
necessary
for
me
to
hurry
i
drop
in
before
noon
however
and
get
that
money
by
the
way
here
are
the
receipts
for
the
money
i
spent
will
you
put
them
away
with
the
others
i
intend
to
live
up
to
my
part
of
the
contract
and
it
will
save
me
the
trouble
of
presenting
them
regularly
in
the
morning
good
night
gentlemen
i
am
sorry
you
were
obliged
to
stay
up
so
late
on
my
account
he
left
them
bravely
enough
but
he
had
more
than
one
moment
of
weakness
before
he
could
meet
his
friends
the
world
seemed
unreal
and
himself
the
most
unreal
thing
in
it
but
the
night
air
acted
as
a
stimulant
and
helped
him
to
call
back
his
courage
when
he
entered
the
studio
at
one
he
was
prepared
to
redeem
his
promise
to
be
the
jolliest
fellow
of
them
all
chapter
xxxiv
the
last
word
i
tell
you
about
it
later
dear
was
all
that
peggy
pleading
could
draw
from
him
at
midnight
dan
had
remonstrated
with
her
you
must
go
home
peggy
dear
she
said
it
is
disgraceful
for
you
to
stay
up
so
late
i
went
to
bed
at
eight
the
night
before
i
was
married
and
fell
asleep
at
four
in
the
morning
smiled
peggy
you
are
quite
mistaken
my
dear
i
did
not
fall
asleep
at
all
but
i
wo
allow
you
to
stop
a
minute
longer
it
puts
rings
under
the
eyes
and
sometimes
they
red
the
morning
after
oh
you
dear
sweet
philosopher
cried
peggy
how
wise
you
are
do
you
think
i
need
a
beauty
sleep
i
do
want
you
to
be
a
sleepy
beauty
that
all
retorted
dan
upon
monty
return
from
his
trying
hour
with
the
lawyers
he
had
been
besieged
with
questions
but
he
was
cleverly
evasive
peggy
alone
was
insistent
she
had
curbed
her
curiosity
until
they
were
on
the
way
home
and
then
she
implored
him
to
tell
her
what
had
happened
the
misery
he
had
endured
was
as
nothing
to
his
reckoning
with
the
woman
who
had
the
right
to
expect
fair
treatment
his
duty
was
clear
but
the
strain
had
been
heavy
and
it
was
not
easy
to
meet
it
peggy
something
terrible
has
happened
he
faltered
uncertain
of
his
course
tell
me
everything
monty
you
can
trust
me
to
be
brave
when
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
he
continued
gravely
it
was
with
the
thought
that
i
could
give
you
everything
i
looked
for
a
fortune
i
never
meant
that
you
should
marry
a
pauper
i
do
understand
you
tried
to
test
my
love
for
you
no
child
not
that
but
i
was
pledged
not
to
speak
of
the
money
i
expected
and
i
wanted
you
so
much
before
it
came
and
it
has
failed
you
she
answered
i
ca
see
that
it
changes
things
i
expected
to
marry
a
pauper
as
you
call
it
do
you
think
this
could
make
a
difference
but
you
do
understand
peggy
i
have
a
penny
in
the
world
you
had
a
penny
when
i
accepted
you
she
replied
i
am
not
afraid
i
believe
in
you
and
if
you
love
me
i
shall
not
give
you
up
dearest
and
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
before
another
word
was
uttered
but
monty
called
to
the
coachman
to
drive
just
once
around
the
block
good
night
my
darling
he
said
when
they
reached
home
sleep
till
eight
if
you
like
there
is
nothing
now
in
the
way
of
having
the
wedding
at
nine
instead
of
at
seven
in
fact
i
have
a
reason
for
wanting
my
whole
fortune
to
come
to
me
then
you
will
be
all
that
i
have
in
the
world
child
but
i
am
the
happiest
man
alive
in
his
room
the
strain
was
relaxed
and
brewster
faced
the
bitter
reality
without
undressing
he
threw
himself
upon
the
lounge
and
wondered
what
the
world
held
for
him
it
held
peggy
at
least
he
thought
and
she
was
enough
but
had
he
been
fair
to
her
was
he
right
in
exacting
a
sacrifice
his
tired
brain
whirled
in
the
effort
to
decide
only
one
thing
was
clear
that
he
could
not
give
her
up
the
future
grew
black
at
the
very
thought
of
it
with
her
he
could
make
things
go
but
alone
it
was
another
matter
he
would
take
the
plunge
and
he
would
justify
it
his
mind
went
traveling
back
over
the
graceless
year
and
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
forfeited
the
confidence
of
men
who
were
worth
while
his
course
in
profligacy
would
not
be
considered
the
best
training
for
business
the
thought
nerved
him
to
action
he
must
make
good
peggy
had
faith
in
him
she
came
to
him
when
everything
was
against
him
and
he
would
slave
for
her
he
would
starve
he
would
do
anything
to
prove
that
she
was
not
mistaken
in
him
she
at
least
should
know
him
for
a
man
looking
toward
the
window
he
saw
the
black
uneasy
night
give
way
to
the
coming
day
haggard
and
faint
he
arose
from
the
couch
to
watch
the
approach
of
the
sun
that
is
indifferent
to
wealth
and
poverty
to
gayety
and
dejection
from
far
off
in
the
gray
light
there
came
the
sound
of
a
five
bell
a
little
later
the
shrieks
of
factory
whistles
were
borne
to
his
ears
muffled
by
distance
but
pregnant
with
the
importance
of
a
new
day
of
toil
they
were
calling
him
with
all
poor
men
to
the
and
the
forge
to
the
great
mill
of
life
the
new
era
had
begun
dawning
bright
and
clear
to
disperse
the
gloom
in
his
soul
leaning
against
the
casement
and
wondering
where
he
could
earn
the
first
dollar
for
the
peggy
brewster
that
was
peggy
gray
he
rose
to
meet
it
with
a
fine
unflinching
fearlessness
before
seven
he
was
down
stairs
and
waiting
joe
bragdon
joined
him
a
bit
later
followed
by
gardner
and
the
minister
the
demilles
appeared
without
an
invitation
but
they
were
not
denied
dan
sagely
shook
her
head
when
told
that
peggy
was
still
asleep
and
that
the
ceremony
was
off
till
nine
monty
are
you
going
away
asked
dan
drawing
him
into
a
corner
just
a
week
in
the
hills
answered
monty
suddenly
remembering
the
generosity
of
his
attorneys
come
in
and
see
me
as
soon
as
you
return
old
man
said
demille
and
monty
knew
that
a
position
would
be
open
to
him
to
dan
fell
the
honor
of
helping
peggy
dress
by
the
time
she
had
had
coffee
and
was
ready
to
go
down
she
was
pink
with
excitement
and
had
quite
forgotten
the
anxiety
which
had
made
the
night
an
age
she
had
never
been
prettier
than
on
her
wedding
morning
her
color
was
rich
her
eyes
as
clear
as
stars
her
woman
body
the
picture
of
grace
and
health
monty
heart
leaped
high
with
love
of
her
the
prettiest
girl
in
new
york
by
jove
gasped
dan
demille
clutching
bragdon
by
the
arm
and
look
at
monty
he
become
a
new
man
in
the
last
five
minutes
added
joe
look
at
the
glow
in
his
cheeks
by
the
eternal
beginning
to
look
as
he
did
a
year
ago
a
clock
chimed
the
hour
of
nine
the
man
who
was
here
yesterday
is
in
the
hall
to
see
brewster
said
the
maid
a
few
minutes
after
the
minister
had
uttered
the
words
that
gave
peggy
a
new
name
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
almost
of
dread
you
mean
the
fellow
with
the
beard
asked
monty
uneasily
yes
sir
he
sent
in
this
letter
begging
you
to
read
it
at
once
shall
i
send
him
away
monty
demanded
bragdon
defiantly
what
does
he
mean
by
coming
at
this
time
i
read
the
letter
first
joe
every
eye
was
on
brewster
as
he
tore
open
the
envelope
his
face
was
expressive
there
was
wonder
in
it
then
incredulity
then
joy
he
threw
the
letter
to
bragdon
clasped
peggy
in
his
arms
spasmodically
and
then
releasing
her
dashed
for
the
hall
like
one
bereft
of
reason
it
nopper
harrison
he
cried
and
a
moment
later
the
tall
visitor
was
dragged
into
the
circle
nopper
was
quite
overcome
by
the
heartiness
of
his
welcome
you
are
an
angel
nopper
god
bless
you
said
monty
with
convincing
emphasis
joe
read
that
letter
aloud
and
then
advertise
for
the
return
of
those
boston
terriers
bragdon
hands
trembled
and
his
voice
was
not
sure
as
he
translated
the
scrawl
nopper
harrison
standing
behind
him
for
the
gleeful
purpose
of
prompting
him
when
the
writing
was
beyond
the
range
of
human
intelligence
holland
house
montgomery
brewster
my
dear
boy
so
you
thought
i
had
given
you
the
slip
eh
did
think
i
show
up
here
and
do
my
part
well
i
do
blame
you
i
suppose
i
acted
like
a
damned
idiot
but
so
long
as
it
turns
out
there
no
harm
done
the
wolf
wo
gnaw
very
much
of
a
hole
in
your
door
i
reckon
this
letter
introduces
my
secretary
oliver
harrison
he
came
to
me
last
june
out
in
butte
with
the
prospectus
of
a
claim
he
had
staked
out
up
in
the
mountains
what
he
wanted
was
backing
and
he
had
such
a
good
show
to
win
out
that
i
went
into
cahoots
with
him
he
got
a
mine
up
there
that
is
dead
sure
to
yield
millions
seems
as
though
he
has
to
give
you
half
of
the
yield
though
says
you
him
good
fellow
this
harrison
needed
a
secretary
and
man
of
affairs
so
took
him
into
my
office
you
can
see
that
he
did
not
take
me
up
into
the
mountains
to
murder
me
as
the
papers
say
this
morning
damned
rot
nobody
business
but
my
own
if
i
concluded
to
come
east
without
telling
everybody
in
butte
about
it
i
am
here
and
so
is
the
money
got
in
last
night
harrison
came
from
chicago
a
day
ahead
of
me
i
went
to
the
office
of
at
eight
this
morning
found
them
in
a
hell
of
a
stew
thought
i
skipped
out
or
been
murdered
money
all
gone
everything
gone
to
smash
that
what
they
thought
do
blame
much
you
see
it
was
this
way
i
concluded
to
follow
out
the
terms
of
the
will
and
deliver
the
goods
in
person
i
got
together
all
of
jim
sedgwick
stuff
and
did
a
lot
of
other
fool
things
i
suppose
and
hiked
on
to
new
york
you
find
about
seven
million
dollars
worth
of
stuff
to
your
credit
when
you
endorse
the
certified
checks
down
at
grant
ripley
my
boy
it
all
here
and
in
the
banks
it
a
mighty
decent
sort
of
wedding
gift
i
reckon
the
lawyers
told
me
all
about
you
told
me
all
about
last
night
and
that
you
were
going
to
be
married
this
morning
by
this
time
comparatively
happy
with
the
bride
i
guess
i
looked
over
your
report
and
took
a
few
peeps
at
the
receipts
they
all
right
i
satisfied
the
money
is
yours
then
i
got
to
thinking
that
maybe
you
would
care
to
come
down
at
nine
especially
as
you
are
just
recovering
from
the
joy
of
being
married
so
i
settled
with
the
lawyers
and
they
settle
with
you
if
you
have
nothing
in
particular
to
do
this
afternoon
about
two
i
suggest
that
you
come
to
the
hotel
and
we
dispose
of
a
few
formalities
that
the
law
requires
of
us
and
you
can
give
me
some
lessons
in
spending
money
i
got
a
little
i
like
to
miss
some
morning
as
for
your
ability
as
a
business
man
i
have
this
to
say
any
man
who
can
spend
a
million
a
year
and
have
nothing
to
show
for
it
do
need
a
recommendation
from
anybody
he
in
a
class
by
himself
and
it
a
business
that
no
one
else
can
give
him
a
pointer
about
the
best
test
of
your
real
capacity
my
boy
is
the
way
you
listed
your
property
for
taxation
it
a
true
sign
of
business
sagacity
that
would
have
decided
me
in
your
favor
if
everything
else
had
been
against
you
i
sorry
you
been
worried
about
all
this
you
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
in
a
year
and
you
have
been
roasted
from
hades
to
breakfast
by
everybody
now
it
your
turn
to
laugh
it
will
surprise
them
to
read
the
i
done
my
duty
to
you
in
more
ways
than
one
i
got
myself
interviewed
by
the
newspapers
and
print
the
whole
truth
about
montgomery
brewster
and
his
millions
they
got
the
sedgwick
will
and
my
story
and
the
old
town
will
boil
with
excitement
i
guess
you
be
squared
before
the
world
all
right
you
better
stay
indoors
for
awhile
though
if
you
want
to
have
a
quiet
honeymoon
i
do
like
new
york
never
did
am
going
back
to
butte
out
there
we
have
real
skyscrapers
and
they
are
not
built
of
brick
they
are
two
or
three
miles
high
and
they
have
gold
in
there
is
real
grass
in
the
lowlands
and
we
have
valleys
that
make
central
park
look
like
a
half
inch
of
nothing
probably
you
and
brewster
were
going
to
take
a
wedding
trip
so
why
not
go
west
with
me
in
my
car
we
start
at
and
i
wo
bother
you
then
you
can
take
it
anywhere
you
like
sincerely
yours
swearengen
jones
i
forgot
to
say
there
is
no
such
man
as
golden
i
bought
your
mines
and
ranches
with
my
own
money
you
may
buy
them
back
at
the
same
figures
i
advise
you
to
do
it
they
be
worth
twice
as
much
in
a
year
i
hope
you
forgive
the
whims
of
an
old
man
who
has
liked
you
from
the
start
