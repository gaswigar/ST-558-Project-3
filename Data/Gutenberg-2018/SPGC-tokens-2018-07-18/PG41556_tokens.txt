i
they
say
that
a
child
childhood
is
the
happiest
time
of
its
life
mine
is
for
it
is
nice
to
do
as
you
like
even
if
it
is
good
for
you
it
is
nice
to
overeat
yourself
even
though
it
does
make
you
ill
afterwards
it
is
a
positive
pleasure
to
go
out
and
do
something
that
catches
you
a
cold
if
you
want
to
and
to
leave
off
your
winter
clothes
a
month
too
soon
children
hate
feeling
stuffy
no
person
understands
that
feeling
that
makes
you
wriggle
and
twist
till
you
get
sent
to
bed
it
is
nice
to
go
to
bed
when
you
are
sleepy
and
no
sooner
not
to
be
despatched
any
time
that
people
are
tired
of
you
and
take
the
quickest
way
to
get
rid
of
a
nuisance
taken
all
round
the
very
nicest
thing
in
the
world
is
your
own
way
and
plenty
of
it
and
you
never
get
that
properly
it
seems
to
me
until
you
are
too
old
to
enjoy
it
or
too
cross
to
admit
that
you
do
i
suspect
that
the
word
will
be
written
on
my
heart
as
calais
was
on
bloody
mary
when
i
am
dead
i
have
got
that
blue
shade
about
the
eyes
that
they
say
children
have
and
i
may
die
young
so
i
am
going
to
write
down
everything
just
as
it
happens
in
my
life
because
when
i
grow
up
i
mean
to
be
an
author
like
my
father
before
me
and
teach
in
song
or
in
prose
what
i
have
learned
in
suffering
doing
this
will
get
me
insensibly
into
the
habit
of
composition
george
my
father
we
always
call
him
by
his
christian
name
by
request
offered
to
look
it
over
for
me
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
shall
avail
myself
of
his
kindness
i
want
to
be
quite
honest
and
set
down
everything
in
malice
as
people
do
and
then
your
book
is
sure
to
be
amusing
i
shall
say
the
worst
i
mean
the
truth
about
everybody
including
myself
that
is
what
makes
a
book
saleable
people
do
like
to
be
put
off
with
short
commons
in
scandal
and
chuck
the
book
into
the
fire
at
once
as
i
have
seen
george
do
when
the
writer
is
too
discreet
my
book
will
not
be
discreet
but
crisp
and
gossippy
even
ariadne
must
not
read
it
however
much
of
my
hair
and
its
leaves
she
pulls
out
for
she
will
claw
me
in
her
rage
of
course
grammar
and
spelling
will
not
be
made
a
specialty
of
because
what
you
gain
in
propriety
you
lose
in
originality
and
i
do
adore
george
own
style
is
said
to
be
the
perfection
of
nervousness
and
vervousness
he
is
a
genius
he
admits
it
i
am
proud
but
not
glad
for
it
cuts
both
ways
and
it
is
hardly
likely
that
there
will
be
two
following
after
each
other
so
soon
in
the
same
family
though
one
never
knows
mozart
father
was
a
musical
man
george
says
that
to
be
daughter
to
such
a
person
is
a
liberal
education
it
seems
about
all
the
education
i
am
likely
to
get
george
teaches
me
greek
and
latin
when
he
has
time
he
wo
touch
ariadne
for
she
is
worth
it
he
says
i
am
apt
dear
me
one
may
as
well
make
lessons
a
pleasure
instead
of
a
scene
ariadne
cried
the
first
time
at
perspective
when
george
after
a
long
explanation
that
puzzled
her
asked
her
in
that
particular
sniffy
tone
teachers
put
on
did
she
see
and
when
he
asked
me
i
did
see
either
but
i
said
i
did
to
prevent
unpleasantness
i
do
not
know
why
i
am
called
tempe
short
for
temper
the
new
cook
says
but
when
i
asked
george
he
laughed
and
bid
me
and
the
cook
beware
of
obvious
derivations
it
appears
that
there
is
a
pretty
place
somewhere
in
greece
called
the
vale
of
tempe
and
that
i
am
named
after
that
surely
a
mistake
my
father
calls
me
a
devil
plain
devil
when
he
is
cross
little
devil
when
he
is
pleased
i
take
it
as
a
compliment
for
look
at
my
sister
ariadne
she
is
as
good
as
gold
and
what
does
she
get
by
it
she
does
not
contradict
or
ask
questions
or
bother
anybody
but
reads
poetry
and
does
her
hair
different
ways
all
day
long
she
never
says
a
sharp
word
ca
george
says
she
is
bound
to
get
left
like
the
first
ariadne
was
she
is
long
and
pale
and
thin
and
white
like
a
snowdrop
except
for
her
reddish
hair
the
pert
hepatica
is
my
favourite
flower
it
comes
straight
out
of
the
ground
like
me
without
any
fuss
or
preparation
in
the
way
of
leaves
and
trimmings
i
know
that
i
am
not
ugly
i
know
it
by
the
art
of
deduction
we
none
of
us
are
or
we
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
survive
george
would
never
have
condescended
to
own
ugly
children
we
should
have
been
exposed
when
we
were
babies
on
primrose
hill
which
is
i
suppose
the
tantamount
of
mount
täygetus
as
the
ancient
greeks
did
their
ugly
babies
we
are
allowed
to
read
lemprière
i
do
what
brutes
those
greeks
were
and
did
not
even
know
one
colour
from
the
other
so
george
says
i
am
right
in
saying
we
are
all
tolerable
the
annoying
thing
is
that
the
new
cook
who
knows
what
she
is
talking
about
says
that
children
go
in
and
out
so
and
even
aunt
gerty
says
that
fancy
children
never
last
and
after
all
this
i
feel
that
the
pretty
ones
can
never
count
on
keeping
up
to
their
own
standard
i
can
not
tell
you
if
our
looks
come
from
our
father
or
our
mother
george
is
small
with
a
very
brown
skin
he
says
he
descends
from
the
little
dark
persistent
races
that
come
down
from
the
mountains
and
take
the
other
savages
sheep
and
cows
he
has
good
eyes
they
dance
and
flash
his
hair
is
black
brushed
back
from
his
forehead
like
a
frenchman
and
very
nice
white
teeth
he
has
a
mouth
like
a
jesuit
i
have
heard
aunt
gerty
say
he
never
sits
very
still
he
is
about
but
he
does
not
like
us
chattering
about
his
age
mother
looks
awfully
young
for
hers
and
she
would
look
prettier
if
she
did
burn
her
eyes
out
over
the
fire
making
dishes
for
george
and
prick
her
fingers
darning
his
socks
till
he
does
find
out
they
are
darned
or
else
he
would
wear
them
again
and
spoil
her
figure
stooping
sewing
and
ironing
george
wo
have
a
sewing
machine
in
the
house
her
head
is
a
very
good
shape
and
she
does
her
hair
plain
over
the
top
to
show
it
george
made
her
sometimes
when
he
is
there
she
does
it
as
she
used
before
she
was
married
all
waved
and
floating
more
like
aunt
gerty
who
is
an
actress
and
dresses
her
head
sunning
over
with
curls
like
maud
george
has
never
caught
mother
like
that
or
he
would
be
very
angry
he
considers
that
she
has
the
bump
of
domesticity
highly
developed
though
even
when
her
hair
is
done
plain
i
never
can
see
it
and
that
is
why
she
enjoys
being
wife
mother
and
upper
housemaid
all
in
one
we
only
keep
two
out
here
at
isleworth
though
my
brother
ben
is
very
useful
as
handy
boy
about
the
place
blacking
our
boots
and
browning
george
and
cleaning
the
windows
and
stopping
them
from
rattling
at
nights
a
thing
that
george
ca
stand
when
he
is
here
when
he
we
just
let
them
rave
and
it
is
a
perfect
concert
for
this
is
a
very
old
georgian
house
mother
makes
everything
sheets
and
our
frocks
and
her
own
she
makes
them
all
by
the
same
pattern
quite
straight
like
sacks
george
likes
to
see
us
dressed
simply
and
of
course
it
saves
dressmakers
bills
or
board
of
women
working
in
the
house
who
simply
eat
you
out
of
it
in
no
time
we
did
have
one
once
to
try
and
when
she
was
lapping
up
cocoa
to
keep
the
cold
out
she
was
sucking
her
thimble
to
fill
up
the
vacuum
we
are
dressed
strictly
utilitarian
and
wear
our
hair
short
like
ben
and
when
it
gets
long
mother
puts
a
pudding
basin
on
our
heads
and
snips
away
all
that
shows
at
last
ariadne
cried
herself
into
leave
to
let
hers
grow
the
new
cook
says
that
if
we
were
dressed
so
queer
ariadne
and
me
we
should
make
some
nice
friends
but
that
is
just
what
george
want
he
likes
us
to
be
and
says
that
there
is
no
one
about
here
that
he
would
care
to
have
us
associate
with
our
doorstep
will
never
wear
down
with
people
coming
in
for
except
aunt
gerty
and
aix
the
oldest
friend
of
the
family
not
a
soul
ever
crosses
the
threshold
i
am
forgetting
the
little
girl
round
the
corner
into
corinth
road
she
comes
here
to
tea
with
us
sometimes
she
is
exactly
between
ariadne
and
me
in
age
so
we
share
her
as
a
friend
equally
we
got
to
know
her
through
our
cat
robert
the
devil
choosing
to
go
and
stay
in
corinth
road
once
at
the
end
of
a
week
her
people
had
the
bright
thought
of
looking
at
the
name
and
address
on
his
collar
and
sent
him
back
by
jessie
who
then
made
friends
with
us
george
said
when
he
was
told
of
it
that
the
hitchings
are
so
much
lower
in
the
social
scale
than
we
are
that
it
perhaps
does
not
matter
our
seeing
a
little
of
each
other
she
is
better
dressed
than
us
in
spite
of
her
low
social
scale
she
has
got
a
real
osprey
in
her
hat
and
a
mink
stole
to
wear
to
church
that
is
so
long
it
keeps
getting
its
ends
in
the
mud
she
does
like
our
george
though
we
like
hers
george
came
out
of
his
study
once
and
passed
through
the
where
jessie
was
having
tea
with
us
is
he
a
said
she
with
her
mouth
full
of
his
we
told
her
that
our
george
was
no
more
of
a
cure
than
hers
which
shut
her
up
and
was
quite
safe
as
neither
ariadne
nor
i
know
what
a
cure
is
she
is
really
a
bad
sort
of
girl
we
teach
her
poetry
and
mythology
and
she
teaches
us
dancing
and
religion
she
has
a
governess
all
to
herself
every
morning
and
goes
to
church
regularly
she
once
said
that
her
mamma
called
us
poor
neglected
children
and
pitied
us
we
hit
her
for
her
mother
and
there
was
an
end
of
that
we
love
each
other
dearly
now
and
have
promised
to
be
bridesmaids
to
each
other
and
godmothers
to
each
other
children
i
am
going
to
have
ten
ariadne
went
to
her
birthday
party
at
christmas
and
did
a
very
silly
thing
that
mother
advised
her
not
to
tell
george
about
every
one
at
home
agreed
that
poor
ariadne
had
been
dreadfully
rude
but
i
ca
see
it
i
adore
sincerity
when
hitchings
asked
her
what
she
would
like
out
of
the
when
it
was
opened
same
as
they
asked
all
the
other
children
ariadne
only
said
quite
modestly
a
new
papa
please
their
faces
frightened
her
so
that
she
tried
to
improve
it
away
and
explain
she
meant
that
she
should
like
an
papa
like
hitchings
not
only
a
sunday
one
like
george
i
know
of
course
what
she
meant
a
papa
that
one
sees
only
from
saturdays
to
mondays
and
not
always
then
is
only
half
a
papa
ariadne
real
name
is
ariadne
florentina
after
one
of
friends
books
she
has
nice
hair
it
is
reddish
and
yet
soft
but
it
wo
curl
by
itself
which
is
a
great
grief
and
sorrow
to
her
but
at
any
rate
her
eyelashes
are
awfully
long
and
dark
and
she
likes
to
put
the
right
over
her
head
and
listen
to
her
eyelashes
scrabbling
about
on
the
sheet
quite
loud
she
has
big
eyes
like
nursery
saucers
the
new
cook
calls
them
loving
eyes
on
the
whole
ariadne
is
pretty
she
would
think
she
was
even
if
she
was
so
it
is
a
good
thing
she
is
she
considers
herself
wasted
for
she
is
over
eighteen
now
and
she
has
never
been
to
a
party
or
worn
a
low
neck
in
her
life
we
have
neither
of
us
ever
seen
a
low
neck
but
we
know
what
it
is
from
books
and
from
them
also
we
learn
that
eighteen
is
the
age
when
it
takes
less
stuff
to
cover
you
the
new
cook
says
that
all
her
young
ladies
at
her
last
place
came
out
when
they
were
only
seventeen
what
is
outness
i
asked
george
once
and
he
said
it
was
a
device
of
the
philistines
i
then
told
him
that
the
new
cook
said
that
ariadne
would
never
be
married
and
off
his
hands
unless
he
gave
her
her
chance
like
other
young
ladies
and
he
said
something
about
a
girl
called
beatrice
who
was
out
and
married
and
dead
before
she
was
nine
her
surname
was
porter
if
i
recollect
the
new
cook
said
hout
and
that
beatrice
porter
was
all
her
eye
and
just
an
excuse
for
selfishness
anyhow
it
is
ariadne
affair
and
she
does
seem
to
care
much
except
when
the
new
cook
fills
her
head
with
ideas
of
revolt
she
walks
about
the
green
garden
reading
novels
and
waiting
for
the
prince
for
she
has
a
nice
nature
i
myself
should
just
turn
down
the
collar
of
my
dress
put
on
a
wreath
and
go
out
and
find
a
prince
or
know
the
reason
why
we
keep
no
gardener
only
ben
ben
is
short
for
benvenuto
cellini
another
of
george
friends
he
is
thirteen
old
enough
to
go
to
school
only
george
has
yet
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
where
to
send
him
it
is
a
good
thing
ben
has
plenty
of
work
to
do
for
he
is
very
cross
and
talks
sometimes
of
running
away
to
sea
only
that
he
has
the
north
border
to
dig
or
cat
corner
to
clear
that
is
the
corner
george
calls
the
pleasaunce
it
is
we
who
call
it
cat
corner
not
only
dead
cats
come
there
but
brickbats
and
tin
kettles
with
just
one
little
hole
in
them
and
parcels
that
we
open
with
a
poker
i
hope
there
will
be
a
dead
baby
in
one
some
day
to
reward
us
the
trees
are
so
dirty
that
we
do
like
to
touch
them
and
the
birds
that
scurry
about
in
the
bushes
would
be
yellow
like
canaries
sarah
says
only
for
the
dirt
of
london
i
hardly
believe
it
i
should
like
to
catch
one
and
wash
it
in
the
opposite
corner
george
has
built
a
grotto
and
we
have
to
keep
it
dusted
and
he
sits
there
and
writes
and
smokes
the
next
garden
is
the
garden
of
a
the
doctor
keeps
a
donkey
and
a
pony
once
a
came
flying
over
the
wall
to
us
george
nerves
were
so
thoroughly
upset
that
he
could
not
bear
anything
but
ouida
and
miss
braddon
read
aloud
to
him
all
the
rest
of
the
day
mother
happens
to
like
those
authors
and
another
italian
lady
books
that
we
are
forbidden
to
mention
in
this
house
she
never
reads
george
own
works
she
says
she
has
promised
to
be
a
good
wife
to
him
but
that
that
was
in
the
bond
she
knows
them
too
well
having
heard
them
all
in
the
rough
behind
the
scenes
in
a
novel
is
as
dull
as
behind
the
scenes
in
a
theatre
you
never
know
what
the
play
is
about
aunt
gerty
says
that
all
george
things
are
rank
and
quite
undramatic
and
george
says
he
is
glad
to
hear
it
for
he
does
like
aunt
gerty
the
other
persons
in
the
house
are
george
cats
there
are
three
the
grey
cat
the
only
one
who
has
kittens
i
call
lady
castlewood
out
of
by
thackeray
george
sometimes
says
that
little
cat
of
a
lady
castlewood
it
occurred
to
me
that
that
little
lady
castlewood
of
a
cat
just
suits
ours
for
she
is
a
jealous
beast
a
cantankerous
beast
and
goes
nap
with
her
claws
all
over
your
face
in
no
time
she
hates
her
children
once
they
are
grown
up
and
is
merely
on
bowing
terms
with
them
or
you
might
call
it
licking
terms
for
she
does
mind
giving
them
a
wash
and
a
whenever
they
come
her
way
robert
the
devil
was
the
one
that
stayed
away
a
week
he
is
very
big
and
mild
he
can
lie
down
and
wrap
himself
in
his
fur
till
he
looks
all
over
alike
and
you
could
find
any
particular
part
of
him
no
more
than
if
he
were
a
kind
of
soft
hedgehog
george
talks
to
them
and
tells
them
things
about
himself
i
am
sure
they
are
welcome
to
his
confidence
that
is
what
the
new
cook
said
she
likes
them
better
than
she
likes
him
she
is
quite
kind
to
cats
though
she
gives
them
a
hoist
with
her
foot
sometimes
when
they
get
in
her
way
they
are
valuable
you
see
i
wish
i
was
for
then
people
care
what
you
eat
and
give
you
medecines
which
i
love
it
often
you
are
disappointed
in
a
new
bottle
of
medecine
except
when
there
gentian
in
it
chapter
ii
you
do
get
a
very
good
class
of
servant
down
this
way
my
mother
says
but
then
she
is
so
particular
she
is
the
kind
of
mistress
who
knows
how
to
do
everything
better
herself
and
that
kind
never
gets
good
servants
it
seems
to
paralyze
the
poor
girls
and
make
them
limp
and
without
an
idea
in
their
heads
or
what
they
choose
to
call
their
heads
which
i
strongly
suspect
is
their
stomachs
you
can
punish
or
reward
a
servant
best
through
its
stomach
and
do
give
them
beer
or
either
beer
makes
them
cross
or
cheeky
depending
i
suppose
on
the
make
of
the
beer
mother
never
gives
it
they
buy
it
i
know
but
i
never
tell
it
would
be
as
much
as
my
place
in
the
kitchen
is
worth
and
i
value
my
right
of
free
entry
mother
is
terribly
down
on
dust
too
she
has
a
book
about
germ
culture
and
sees
germs
in
everything
it
does
make
her
any
happier
but
as
for
dusting
so
far
as
i
can
see
what
they
call
dusting
is
only
a
plan
for
raising
the
dirt
and
taking
it
to
some
other
place
it
gets
into
our
mouths
in
the
end
i
do
pity
matter
that
is
always
getting
into
the
wrong
place
chivied
here
and
there
with
no
for
the
sole
of
the
foot
for
whenever
mother
sees
dust
anywhere
or
suspects
it
she
makes
a
cross
with
her
finger
in
it
and
the
servants
are
supposed
to
see
the
cross
and
feel
ashamed
though
i
do
believe
any
servant
was
ever
ashamed
in
her
life
is
in
their
natures
they
just
grin
and
bear
with
it
with
the
dust
and
the
scolding
too
it
little
way
i
heard
sarah
say
once
not
a
bit
unkindly
or
disagreeably
though
after
mother
had
come
down
on
her
about
something
but
once
i
caught
the
very
same
girl
shaking
her
fist
at
george
back
and
calling
him
an
old
beast
sarah
i
said
whom
are
you
addressing
the
doctor
donkey
miss
she
said
as
quick
as
lightning
pointing
to
it
grazing
in
the
doctor
garden
next
door
people
were
always
overloading
that
donkey
and
shaking
their
fists
at
it
i
must
get
to
the
new
cook
the
last
one
gave
mother
notice
and
i
never
could
find
out
why
because
she
was
fond
of
mother
and
could
stand
the
cats
oh
i
like
i
heard
her
say
just
as
if
she
disliked
some
one
else
mother
took
no
notice
but
left
the
kitchen
and
cook
took
a
currant
off
her
elbow
and
pulled
down
her
sleeves
and
mumbled
to
sarah
it
is
right
and
i
for
one
ai
going
to
help
countenance
it
his
family
now
and
then
between
jobs
just
like
a
burglar
or
worse
what
is
worse
than
a
burglar
i
was
passing
the
scullery
window
and
sarah
had
just
thrown
a
lot
of
boiling
water
into
a
basin
in
front
of
them
both
so
that
it
made
a
mist
and
she
did
see
me
i
knew
though
she
was
saying
something
rude
for
when
sarah
told
her
she
reely
she
muttered
something
more
about
a
neglected
angel
i
did
think
at
first
she
meant
me
or
perhaps
the
doctor
donkey
as
usual
but
then
the
words
did
fit
either
of
us
i
asked
her
straight
if
she
did
mean
the
donkey
just
for
fun
and
she
said
the
poor
beast
was
minding
his
own
business
and
i
had
better
do
the
same
she
left
us
next
month
crying
worse
than
i
ever
did
in
my
life
for
really
serious
things
mother
patted
her
on
the
back
as
she
went
out
at
the
back
door
and
she
kept
saying
a
poor
girl
only
got
her
character
mum
and
she
is
bound
to
think
of
it
and
mother
said
yes
yes
you
did
quite
right
and
seemed
just
to
want
her
out
of
the
house
and
a
little
peace
and
quiet
and
will
of
her
own
the
very
moment
sarah
back
was
turned
she
set
to
work
and
turned
everything
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
left
it
there
while
she
and
cook
swept
round
into
every
corner
ariadne
and
i
rather
enjoyed
clearing
our
bed
of
the
before
we
could
lie
down
in
it
and
having
dinner
off
the
corner
of
the
because
the
one
was
lying
on
its
back
like
a
horse
kicking
of
course
george
was
allowed
home
all
this
time
mother
wrote
to
him
where
he
was
staying
at
the
duke
of
frocester
for
the
shooting
george
shooting
my
eye
and
the
keeper
legs
and
said
he
had
better
not
come
home
till
we
were
straight
again
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
be
straight
again
it
was
like
heaven
when
i
was
a
child
i
always
built
my
brick
houses
crooked
and
ariadne
called
me
queen
unstraight
and
that
made
me
cry
but
she
liked
this
too
we
made
all
the
beds
and
did
bother
to
tuck
them
in
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
when
we
turn
head
over
heels
in
the
onto
the
floor
every
night
three
times
to
make
us
dizzy
and
sleepy
we
washed
up
everything
with
a
nice
lather
of
three
things
mixed
that
occurred
to
me
hudson
monkey
soap
and
bath
eucryl
in
the
end
there
was
a
speck
of
dirt
or
pattern
either
left
on
the
plates
it
looked
much
cleaner
why
should
one
eat
one
meat
off
a
fat
chinese
dragon
or
have
bees
all
round
the
edge
of
one
soup
plate
ready
to
fall
in
it
is
a
dirty
idea
we
basted
the
joints
turn
and
turn
about
and
our
own
pinafores
they
could
scold
us
for
not
keeping
clean
any
more
than
they
can
pigs
when
they
put
them
in
a
sty
we
asked
no
questions
or
bothered
mother
at
all
but
we
the
steps
and
the
grates
and
washed
down
the
walls
with
the
wallpaper
peeled
off
here
and
there
but
that
shows
it
was
shabby
and
ready
for
death
mother
said
afterwards
that
she
could
see
any
improvement
anywhere
but
anyhow
we
enjoyed
ourselves
and
that
is
everything
we
spent
money
on
it
for
we
bought
pictures
and
did
bouquets
all
over
the
mantelpieces
but
mother
insisted
we
should
peel
all
these
off
again
before
george
came
back
he
could
come
back
till
we
got
that
cook
for
george
is
most
absurdly
particular
about
our
servants
sarah
has
got
used
to
him
and
there
seems
to
be
no
idea
of
her
going
she
has
to
valet
him
for
he
is
always
beautifully
dressed
she
has
to
take
the
greatest
care
of
her
own
appearance
and
get
her
nails
manicured
and
her
hair
waved
when
he
is
at
home
that
is
about
all
for
her
but
the
cook
he
calls
the
keeper
of
his
conscience
that
is
to
say
his
digestion
his
digestion
is
as
jumpy
as
he
is
sometimes
it
wants
everything
quite
plain
and
he
will
eat
nothing
but
our
and
cold
shapes
of
tapioca
etc
at
another
time
he
calls
it
apparition
and
says
the
very
name
of
it
makes
him
shiver
i
am
used
to
cold
shapes
alas
he
sometimes
brings
things
down
from
town
himself
caviare
and
patty
de
foy
children
are
not
supposed
to
like
that
sort
of
thing
but
we
do
and
george
gives
them
us
he
is
not
mean
in
trifles
sometimes
it
is
pheasants
and
partridges
that
he
has
shot
himself
on
ducal
acres
they
are
shot
very
badly
not
tidily
with
the
shot
all
in
one
place
as
it
ought
to
be
aix
explained
this
to
me
they
are
not
to
be
cooked
till
they
are
ready
and
when
they
are
they
are
a
little
too
ready
for
mother
and
us
so
papa
and
aix
have
to
eat
it
all
george
belongs
to
the
sect
of
the
epicureans
i
heard
him
tell
the
cook
so
also
that
he
is
the
reincarnation
of
a
gentleman
called
villon
for
a
month
mother
sat
in
for
cooks
and
all
sorts
of
fat
and
lean
women
came
and
went
our
establishment
did
seem
attractive
george
bespoke
a
fat
one
by
letter
but
mother
inclined
to
lean
these
women
sat
on
the
best
chairs
and
prodded
the
pattern
of
the
carpets
with
their
dusty
umbrellas
and
asked
tons
of
questions
far
more
than
she
asked
them
it
seemed
to
me
and
this
one
that
we
have
at
last
got
was
the
coolest
of
all
but
in
rather
a
nice
way
she
was
tall
and
thin
with
a
long
nose
with
a
dip
in
it
just
before
the
tip
which
was
particularly
broad
ariadne
said
afterwards
that
a
nose
like
that
seemed
to
need
a
bustle
she
said
she
was
a
woman
and
that
is
about
all
she
did
tell
us
about
herself
except
her
name
elizabeth
cawthorne
she
sat
and
asked
questions
when
she
came
to
the
usual
and
if
you
please
how
many
is
there
in
family
mother
answered
myself
and
my
son
and
my
two
daughters
and
my
sister
she
is
professional
and
is
here
for
long
visits
that
is
all
then
i
take
it
you
are
a
widow
mother
getting
very
red
explained
that
george
is
very
little
at
home
so
that
in
one
way
he
did
count
but
in
another
way
he
did
for
he
is
very
particular
and
has
to
be
cooked
for
specially
being
an
author
he
has
got
a
very
delicate
appetite
a
proud
stomach
i
understand
ye
well
i
shall
hope
to
give
him
satisfaction
she
said
that
as
if
she
would
have
liked
to
add
or
know
the
reason
why
she
seemed
quite
to
have
settled
in
her
own
mind
that
she
was
going
to
take
our
place
she
blessed
mother
bonny
face
before
that
interview
was
over
and
passed
me
over
entirely
she
came
in
in
a
week
and
the
first
time
she
saw
george
she
was
doing
her
hall
ariadne
and
i
were
there
as
george
hansom
drove
up
and
he
got
out
and
began
a
shindy
with
the
cabman
honeys
this
will
be
your
father
i
thinking
she
said
perhaps
she
expected
us
to
rush
into
his
arms
but
we
did
we
knew
better
we
just
said
hallo
and
waited
till
he
was
disengaged
with
the
cabman
who
wanted
too
much
as
we
are
beyond
the
radius
george
give
it
to
him
but
a
good
talking
to
instead
the
new
cook
stopped
sweeping
servants
always
stop
their
work
when
there
is
something
going
on
that
does
concern
them
and
looked
quite
pleased
with
george
he
can
explain
himself
and
no
mistake
she
said
to
sarah
afterwards
and
she
cooked
a
splendid
dinner
that
night
for
says
she
to
sarah
seemed
to
her
he
was
the
kind
of
master
who
let
a
woman
know
if
she
did
suit
him
she
does
make
much
account
of
childer
in
fact
i
think
she
hates
them
for
when
ariadne
showed
her
the
young
shoots
in
a
pot
of
snowdrops
she
was
bringing
up
and
said
see
cook
they
have
had
babies
in
the
night
elizabeth
meaning
to
be
civil
said
things
miss
still
she
is
really
unkind
to
children
and
admits
that
they
have
a
right
to
exist
she
will
boil
me
my
and
make
me
paste
and
lets
ariadne
heat
her
between
the
bars
of
the
kitchen
fire
she
does
matter
cats
but
she
gives
them
their
meals
regular
and
does
hold
with
them
loafing
in
the
kitchen
and
getting
stolen
or
bestowed
and
they
know
she
is
just
though
not
generous
and
never
forgets
their
supper
they
were
all
hid
as
it
happened
when
she
came
about
the
place
but
she
said
she
knew
she
had
got
into
a
cat
house
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
eating
fluff
with
her
tea
and
she
thinks
she
ought
to
have
been
told
george
laughs
at
her
and
calls
her
stern
daughter
of
the
north
but
he
was
a
bit
cross
when
she
told
him
that
ben
ought
to
be
sent
to
school
he
even
agreed
but
ben
is
sent
ben
is
still
eating
his
heart
out
and
he
keeps
telling
elizabeth
cawthorne
so
he
is
much
in
the
kitchen
she
is
very
sensible
she
just
stuffs
a
jam
tart
into
his
mouth
and
says
tak
that
atween
whiles
then
my
bonny
bairn
to
distract
ye
ben
takes
it
like
a
lamb
and
it
does
distract
him
or
at
any
rate
it
distends
him
he
has
got
fat
since
she
came
she
orders
mother
about
as
if
she
were
a
child
mother
look
very
young
as
i
have
said
she
ought
and
so
ought
aunt
gerty
considering
the
trouble
they
both
take
to
keep
the
cloven
hoof
of
age
off
their
faces
they
go
to
bed
with
poultices
of
oatmeal
on
them
and
aunt
gerty
once
tried
the
plaster
but
what
she
does
in
the
night
she
undoes
in
the
day
with
the
grease
paint
and
sticky
messes
that
are
part
of
her
profession
she
lives
with
us
except
when
she
is
on
tour
and
is
only
here
when
she
is
resting
in
the
and
all
that
time
she
is
dreadfully
cross
because
she
would
rather
be
doing
than
resting
for
resting
is
only
a
polite
way
of
saying
no
one
has
wanted
to
engage
her
and
that
she
is
out
of
a
shop
which
all
actresses
hate
chapter
iii
i
have
forced
george
hand
so
i
am
told
and
neither
he
nor
mother
take
any
notice
of
me
but
aunt
gerty
hugged
me
all
over
when
she
heard
what
i
had
done
and
scolded
mother
for
not
being
nice
to
me
i
do
see
why
you
need
put
that
poor
child
in
coventry
she
said
you
had
more
need
to
be
grateful
to
her
than
not
how
much
longer
was
it
going
to
go
on
i
want
to
know
hiding
away
his
lawful
wife
like
an
old
bluebeard
and
me
sister
anne
boiling
over
and
wanting
to
call
it
all
from
the
well
gerty
you
seem
to
have
got
it
a
bit
mixed
said
mother
but
talking
of
bluebeard
i
always
envied
the
first
the
lots
of
cupboard
room
she
must
have
had
i
wonder
if
she
was
a
hoarder
like
me
who
never
have
the
heart
to
throw
anything
away
if
i
do
happen
to
see
the
plans
for
the
new
house
i
will
speak
up
for
lots
of
cupboards
and
that
is
all
i
care
about
see
the
plans
why
of
course
you
will
is
it
your
right
you
must
make
a
point
of
seeing
them
and
putting
your
word
in
look
after
your
own
comfort
in
this
world
or
you
will
jolly
well
find
yourself
out
in
the
cold
and
with
a
husband
like
you
got
bother
moving
said
mother
in
her
dreary
way
that
comes
when
she
has
been
overdoing
it
as
she
has
lately
it
is
an
odious
wrench
just
like
having
all
one
teeth
out
at
once
had
need
yours
are
just
beautiful
one
of
your
points
lucy
and
do
you
forget
it
the
life
here
suited
me
well
enough
i
had
got
used
to
it
i
suppose
you
can
get
used
to
something
bad
ca
you
but
that
no
reason
you
are
not
to
welcome
a
change
oh
you
like
the
new
life
that
to
be
spent
in
the
daylight
like
instead
of
this
kind
of
the
scenes
you
have
been
doing
for
eighteen
years
and
a
pretty
woman
still
for
so
you
are
cheer
up
you
are
going
to
get
new
scenery
new
dresses
new
backcloth
you
see
everything
through
the
stage
gerty
i
must
say
it
irritates
one
sometimes
especially
now
when
i
know
what
you
mean
no
offence
my
dear
old
sis
and
you
can
depend
on
me
not
to
be
bringing
the
smell
of
the
footlights
as
they
call
it
it
the
only
truly
pleasant
smell
there
is
to
my
idea
into
your
fine
new
house
pity
but
ca
get
a
little
whiff
of
it
into
his
comedies
and
some
manager
would
see
his
way
to
putting
them
on
perhaps
no
beloved
me
and
george
do
cotton
to
each
other
nor
never
shall
he
is
my
sort
i
like
a
man
that
is
a
man
not
a
society
baa
i
no
patience
with
such
sh
gerty
you
seem
to
forget
his
child
sitting
messing
away
with
her
paints
in
a
corner
so
quietly
there
that
was
me
aunt
gerty
stopped
a
minute
and
then
they
went
on
just
the
same
we
have
never
minded
the
child
yet
which
was
true
and
i
do
see
why
we
should
begin
now
tempe
is
getting
quite
a
woman
and
able
to
hold
her
tongue
when
needful
and
she
knows
her
way
about
her
precious
father
well
enough
what
you
to
think
of
now
lucy
is
getting
your
hands
white
and
the
marks
of
sewing
and
cooking
off
lemons
and
pumice
cream
good
too
you
have
been
george
taylor
upper
servant
too
long
gracious
who
that
at
the
aunt
gerty
nearly
knocked
me
over
in
her
rush
to
the
window
we
were
all
three
sitting
in
the
front
bedroom
which
is
george
when
he
is
at
home
and
mother
had
been
washing
my
hair
it
was
a
dreadfully
hot
day
a
only
we
have
any
dogs
but
the
kittens
were
tastefully
arranged
in
the
spare
all
round
the
jug
for
coolness
they
had
put
themselves
there
we
humans
had
got
very
little
clothes
on
partly
for
heat
and
also
having
got
out
of
the
habit
of
dressing
in
the
afternoons
for
no
callers
ever
came
to
the
magnolias
but
there
were
some
now
there
was
a
big
thing
at
the
door
such
as
i
have
often
seen
driving
out
to
hampton
court
but
never
never
had
i
seen
one
stop
at
our
gate
before
it
was
most
exciting
i
hoped
jessie
hitchings
and
her
mother
saw
there
were
two
ladies
inside
one
of
them
old
and
frumpy
the
other
was
lady
scilly
whom
i
knew
though
mother
did
i
have
got
to
her
yet
in
my
story
a
footman
was
taking
their
orders
and
sarah
was
standing
at
the
door
holding
on
to
her
cap
that
she
forgotten
to
put
a
pin
in
lucky
she
had
a
cap
on
at
all
mother
does
like
her
to
leave
her
caps
off
to
go
to
the
door
even
when
george
is
here
out
of
principle
and
for
once
it
told
for
goodness
sake
get
your
head
in
gerty
you
have
got
the
shade
a
bit
too
strong
cried
mother
pulling
my
aunt
in
by
her
petticoats
and
nearly
upsetting
the
mirror
on
the
aunt
gerty
came
in
with
a
cross
grunt
and
we
all
sat
well
inside
till
we
heard
the
carriage
drive
away
and
sarah
mounting
the
stairs
all
of
a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
please
m
she
cried
almost
before
she
got
into
the
room
there
a
just
called
anything
in
it
mother
said
two
ladies
m
and
here
their
cards
i
took
one
and
aunt
gerty
the
other
dowager
countess
of
fylingdales
aunt
gerty
read
as
if
she
was
lady
macbeth
saying
out
dammed
spot
the
card
i
held
was
for
lady
scilly
and
there
was
one
for
lord
scilly
but
it
had
got
under
the
drawers
i
said
you
was
dressed
sarah
said
looking
at
apron
all
over
egg
and
her
sleeves
no
more
i
am
said
mother
laughing
do
look
so
disappointed
gerty
i
could
have
seen
them
but
you
should
have
said
your
mistress
was
dressed
sarah
said
aunt
gerty
it
is
done
like
that
in
good
houses
you
should
have
said
mistress
is
gone
out
in
carriage
but
that
would
have
been
a
lie
argued
sarah
and
i
sure
i
want
to
go
to
hell
even
for
a
oh
where
have
you
been
before
sarah
aunt
gerty
sighed
not
to
know
that
a
society
lie
ca
let
any
one
in
for
hell
fire
well
it
is
too
late
now
they
have
gone
and
it
was
rather
a
shabby
turnout
for
aristocratic
swells
like
that
after
all
they
did
really
want
to
see
me
said
mother
they
only
called
on
me
to
please
george
he
sent
them
probably
i
have
heard
him
speak
of
lady
fylingdales
he
stays
there
she
is
one
of
his
oldest
friends
she
is
lame
and
nearly
blind
lady
scilly
i
shall
never
like
from
what
i
have
heard
of
her
tempe
run
in
the
garden
in
the
sun
and
dry
your
hair
off
you
go
and
get
a
sunstroke
thought
i
just
because
she
wants
to
talk
to
aunt
gerty
about
the
grand
callers
so
i
stayed
and
they
have
got
so
in
the
habit
of
not
minding
me
that
they
went
on
as
if
i
really
had
been
out
broiling
in
the
sun
mother
began
to
talk
very
fast
about
the
new
house
and
getting
printed
and
taking
her
place
in
society
these
ladies
coming
had
given
her
thoughts
a
fresh
jog
she
nearly
cried
over
the
bother
of
it
all
and
what
george
would
now
go
expecting
of
her
and
she
with
no
education
and
no
ambition
to
be
a
smart
woman
as
aunt
gerty
was
continually
egging
her
on
to
be
saying
it
was
quite
easy
if
you
only
had
a
nice
slight
figure
like
she
has
bead
chains
and
wo
do
it
as
you
seem
to
think
mother
said
and
even
if
i
get
to
be
smart
i
shall
never
get
to
be
happy
happy
screamed
my
aunt
gertrude
who
talked
of
being
happy
you
do
go
expecting
to
be
happy
unless
it
makes
you
happy
as
it
ought
to
put
your
foot
down
on
those
cats
who
have
been
leading
your
husband
astray
all
these
years
and
giving
them
a
good
it
would
me
that
all
i
can
say
happiness
indeed
it
is
something
higher
than
mere
happiness
what
you
have
got
to
do
my
dear
lucy
is
just
to
take
your
call
and
go
on
not
before
you
had
a
trip
to
paris
for
your
clothes
though
and
show
them
all
what
a
pretty
woman
george
despised
wife
is
there
an
object
to
live
for
that
your
ticket
and
you
got
it
he
married
you
for
your
looks
now
did
he
nothing
else
said
mother
sadly
nonsense
were
you
are
you
as
good
as
he
you
are
the
daughter
of
a
respectable
irish
clergyman
whose
daughter
i
mean
son
is
he
a
french
tailor
i
expect
you
married
him
eighteen
years
ago
in
putney
parish
church
by
special
licence
when
he
was
nothing
and
nobody
cared
whom
or
what
he
married
little
flighty
undersized
creature
you
have
been
a
good
wife
to
him
borne
his
children
nursed
him
when
he
was
ill
and
kept
a
house
going
for
him
to
come
back
to
when
he
was
tired
of
the
others
and
if
it
been
done
on
the
sly
it
been
through
any
will
of
yours
and
now
that
the
matter
has
been
taken
out
of
his
hands
and
a
good
thing
too
and
he
obliged
to
leave
off
his
dirty
little
tricks
and
own
you
and
send
his
grand
friends
to
call
on
you
and
build
a
nice
house
to
put
you
in
you
want
to
back
out
and
hide
yourself
lose
your
chance
once
for
all
and
for
ever
you
are
your
children
are
sweet
you
soon
catch
them
all
up
and
then
you
can
be
as
haughty
and
as
the
rest
of
them
if
it
is
you
are
thinking
of
i
sha
trouble
you
i
have
my
work
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
it
i
shall
never
disown
you
gerty
no
i
dare
say
not
but
i
sha
put
myself
in
the
way
of
a
snub
got
one
thing
that
been
very
useful
to
me
in
this
life
that
tact
i
sha
make
a
nasty
row
or
a
talk
but
you
not
see
more
of
me
than
you
want
to
i
a
lady
i
never
let
anybody
deny
that
but
knocked
about
the
world
a
bit
and
it
a
rough
place
and
that
soft
dainty
manner
people
admire
so
rubs
off
pretty
soon
fighting
one
own
battles
the
aristocracy
can
afford
to
keep
it
on
clothes
does
it
largely
where
you
wearing
chiffon
i
be
wearing
linen
that
the
diff
now
i
off
first
act
and
share
a
dresser
with
three
other
cats
where
there
is
room
to
swing
one
i
not
as
vulgar
as
you
think
she
put
on
her
carefully
with
sixteen
pins
in
it
and
went
away
mother
asked
me
why
i
had
been
drying
my
hair
in
the
garden
all
this
time
because
i
wanted
to
hear
what
aunt
gerty
had
to
say
i
answered
and
mother
accepted
the
explanation
but
now
i
went
and
found
a
cool
place
and
meditated
on
my
sins
i
am
not
what
is
called
a
strictly
naughty
child
i
am
too
busy
satan
never
need
bother
about
me
or
find
mischief
for
me
to
do
for
my
hands
are
never
idle
and
i
can
generally
find
it
for
myself
on
the
eventful
morning
that
decided
our
fate
three
weeks
before
this
incident
i
was
in
the
where
we
hardly
ever
sit
making
devils
with
george
name
with
the
ink
out
of
the
best
inkstand
i
spilt
it
why
do
these
things
happen
it
is
the
fault
of
fatality
there
is
nothing
i
hate
more
than
the
sickening
smell
of
spilt
ink
or
rather
the
soapy
rags
they
chose
to
rub
it
up
with
so
i
went
up
to
my
room
quietly
intending
to
get
my
hat
and
go
out
till
it
had
blown
over
or
rather
soaked
in
sarah
was
there
tidying
or
something
and
she
said
immediately
now
whatever
have
you
been
up
to
i
told
her
that
the
word
ever
was
quite
surplus
in
that
sentence
and
that
george
objected
to
it
strongly
thus
i
got
away
from
her
wishing
i
had
a
less
expressive
face
i
found
myself
in
the
street
without
an
object
i
have
got
beyond
the
age
of
runaway
rings
thank
goodness
but
they
did
use
to
amuse
me
till
one
day
an
old
gentleman
got
hold
of
me
and
went
on
about
the
length
of
kitchen
stairs
generally
and
the
shortness
of
cooks
legs
and
the
cruel
risk
of
things
boiling
over
he
changed
my
heart
so
this
day
i
just
walked
along
to
a
that
i
saw
at
the
end
of
the
next
street
but
one
standing
in
front
of
the
milliner
arms
with
nobody
in
it
i
expected
the
man
was
having
a
drink
for
it
was
piping
hot
i
got
into
the
car
and
sat
down
and
just
put
my
hand
on
the
thing
in
front
considering
if
i
should
set
the
car
going
it
was
the
very
first
time
i
had
ever
been
in
a
motor
in
my
life
and
i
simply
had
the
heart
to
miss
the
chance
a
lady
came
out
of
the
public
i
never
saw
anything
so
pretty
and
her
dress
was
all
billowy
like
the
little
fluffy
clouds
we
call
sheep
in
a
blue
sky
and
the
hem
of
it
was
covered
with
sawdust
off
the
floor
yet
i
ca
say
she
looked
at
all
tipsy
i
wanted
a
so
badly
i
just
had
to
go
in
and
get
it
she
said
this
in
an
apologizing
sort
of
way
while
i
was
just
wondering
how
i
should
explain
my
presence
in
her
car
she
settled
that
for
me
by
saying
with
a
little
sweet
smile
well
you
pretty
child
how
do
you
like
my
it
is
the
first
time
i
oh
of
course
would
you
like
to
be
in
one
while
it
is
on
the
move
i
confessed
i
should
and
she
jumped
in
beside
me
saying
sit
still
then
child
and
moved
the
starfish
thing
in
front
and
we
were
off
mercy
what
a
rate
policemen
seemed
to
hold
up
their
hands
in
amazement
at
us
and
she
looked
pleased
and
flattered
we
drove
on
and
on
past
the
hounslow
turning
through
miles
of
nursery
gardens
and
then
miles
of
slums
till
at
last
the
houses
got
smarter
and
bigger
and
i
guessed
this
was
the
part
of
london
where
george
lives
only
i
did
not
ask
questions
i
hardly
ever
do
i
did
see
a
clock
once
and
i
saw
it
was
nearly
our
lunch
time
i
realized
that
i
had
missed
for
once
and
was
glad
she
talked
all
the
way
along
and
i
listened
i
find
that
is
what
people
like
for
she
kept
telling
me
that
i
was
a
nice
child
and
that
she
thought
she
should
run
away
with
me
you
running
away
with
me
i
said
and
you
do
care
a
bit
you
very
imperturbable
atom
i
think
i
shall
take
you
home
with
me
to
luncheon
you
amuse
me
she
amused
she
was
a
darling
so
gay
so
light
as
if
she
care
about
anything
and
had
never
had
a
in
her
whole
life
if
george
friends
are
like
this
i
do
wonder
he
prefers
them
to
aunt
gerty
mother
can
be
as
amusing
as
anybody
i
am
not
going
to
try
to
take
mother
down
but
even
she
ca
pretend
she
is
happy
as
this
woman
seemed
to
be
she
was
like
champagne
the
very
dry
kind
george
opens
a
bottle
of
when
he
is
down
and
gives
mother
and
me
a
whole
glassful
between
us
we
were
quite
in
a
town
now
and
on
a
soft
pavement
made
of
wood
like
my
bedroom
floor
the
streets
oddly
enough
grew
grander
and
narrower
she
told
me
about
the
houses
as
we
went
along
that
is
where
my
uncle
the
duke
of
frocester
lives
she
said
and
pointed
to
a
kind
of
grey
tomb
with
a
paved
courtyard
in
a
very
tiny
street
i
knew
that
name
the
name
of
the
man
george
stays
and
shoots
with
but
of
course
i
did
say
anything
then
we
passed
a
funny
little
house
in
a
smaller
street
called
after
a
chapel
and
there
was
a
fanlight
over
the
door
and
a
great
extinguisher
thing
on
the
railings
you
have
no
idea
what
a
lovely
place
that
is
inside
she
told
me
a
great
friend
of
mine
lives
there
and
pulled
it
about
he
took
out
all
the
inside
of
the
house
and
made
false
walls
to
the
rooms
one
of
them
has
just
the
naked
bricks
and
mortar
showing
but
then
the
mortar
is
all
gilt
he
always
has
quantities
of
flowers
great
arum
lilies
shining
in
the
gloom
and
oleanders
in
pots
and
stunted
japanese
trees
he
gives
heavenly
and
little
suppers
after
the
play
he
writes
plays
but
somehow
they
have
never
been
acted
that
i
know
of
bachelors
always
do
you
so
well
i
declare
if
i
was
going
to
see
him
this
very
afternoon
at
my
club
i
would
go
in
and
surprise
him
now
that
i
have
got
you
with
me
you
little
elf
you
have
certainly
got
the
widest
open
eyes
i
ever
saw
he
is
probably
in
there
now
working
at
his
little
table
in
the
window
getting
up
the
notes
for
his
lecture
so
we
should
put
him
out
abominably
i
will
take
you
to
the
lecture
instead
and
remind
me
to
lend
you
one
of
his
books
that
is
if
your
mother
allows
you
to
read
novels
i
explained
to
her
that
i
was
a
little
off
novels
as
my
father
kept
us
on
them
oh
does
he
how
interesting
i
love
authors
you
must
introduce
him
to
me
some
day
bring
him
to
one
of
my
literary
teas
i
always
make
a
point
of
raising
an
author
or
so
for
the
afternoon
it
pleases
my
crowd
so
far
better
than
music
and
recitations
and
amusements
of
that
kind
and
then
one
does
have
to
pay
them
they
are
only
too
glad
to
come
and
get
paid
in
kind
looks
that
cost
nothing
the
queerer
they
are
the
more
people
believe
in
them
i
used
to
have
socialists
but
really
they
were
dirty
some
authors
now
are
quite
smart
and
wear
their
hair
no
longer
than
lord
scilly
or
so
very
little
longer
now
there
is
morrell
aix
the
man
who
wrote
i
took
him
up
but
he
had
been
obliged
he
said
to
live
in
the
slums
for
two
years
to
get
up
his
facts
and
you
could
have
grown
mustard
and
cress
on
the
creases
of
his
collar
and
i
do
think
considering
the
advertisement
he
gave
them
the
laundresses
might
have
taken
more
trouble
with
the
poor
shirts
i
knew
aix
of
course
and
i
have
often
seen
mother
take
the
to
him
but
i
said
nothing
for
i
like
to
show
i
can
hold
my
tongue
knowledge
is
power
if
it
ever
so
unimportant
we
did
go
far
from
the
house
with
walls
like
stopped
teeth
before
she
pulled
up
at
another
rather
smart
little
door
in
a
street
called
curzon
here
we
are
at
my
place
and
there
simmy
hermyre
on
the
doorstep
waiting
to
be
asked
to
lunch
it
was
a
nice
clean
house
with
green
shutters
and
lovely
lace
curtains
at
the
windows
that
ariadne
would
have
been
glad
of
for
a
dress
all
gathered
and
tucked
and
made
to
fit
the
sash
as
if
it
had
been
a
person
the
young
man
standing
at
the
front
door
had
a
coat
with
a
waist
and
a
nice
clean
face
and
a
collar
that
would
let
him
turn
his
head
quickly
he
helped
us
out
and
she
laughed
at
him
as
if
he
was
hers
are
you
under
the
impression
that
i
have
asked
you
to
lunch
why
i
do
suppose
there
is
any
imagine
her
saying
that
when
she
had
brought
me
all
the
way
from
isleworth
to
have
it
i
did
of
course
say
anything
and
she
made
me
go
in
and
the
young
man
followed
us
quite
calm
although
she
had
said
there
was
anything
for
him
to
eat
i
would
introduce
you
to
this
person
i
thought
it
so
nice
of
her
not
to
stick
on
the
offensive
words
little
or
young
only
it
strikes
me
i
do
know
her
name
she
did
ask
it
but
went
on
it
a
most
original
little
creature
and
amused
me
more
in
an
hour
than
you
have
in
a
year
my
dear
boy
now
had
i
said
anything
particularly
amusing
i
had
tried
and
i
do
think
you
should
leave
off
calling
children
it
after
the
first
six
months
mothers
hate
it
still
though
i
did
think
her
quite
polite
i
told
her
my
name
tempe
in
a
low
voice
so
that
she
could
introduce
me
to
her
great
friend
as
we
were
going
to
lunch
at
the
same
table
i
thought
there
would
be
a
children
table
as
she
speak
of
children
and
i
was
glad
for
children
eat
like
pigs
and
have
no
conversation
her
eyebrows
went
up
and
her
mouth
went
down
but
she
soon
buttoned
up
her
lips
again
though
they
stayed
open
at
the
corners
and
introduce
me
to
hermyre
at
all
i
did
suppose
i
should
ever
meet
him
again
so
it
did
matter
we
went
in
and
had
lunch
and
it
was
quite
a
grand
lunch
hot
and
as
much
again
cold
on
a
but
i
was
actually
offered
i
would
have
believed
it
in
a
house
like
this
i
refused
rather
curtly
but
she
ate
it
and
very
little
else
i
generally
take
water
at
home
but
i
did
not
see
why
i
should
taste
champagne
when
i
had
the
chance
and
i
took
a
great
deal
quite
a
full
glass
full
and
when
i
had
taken
it
i
felt
as
if
i
could
fight
a
lion
george
often
says
when
he
comes
back
from
london
that
he
has
been
fighting
with
wild
beasts
at
ephesus
i
wondered
if
i
might
not
meet
some
this
afternoon
at
the
lecture
at
the
club
lady
scilly
that
her
name
said
she
must
take
me
and
i
knew
i
should
be
bored
but
i
could
very
well
say
no
you
may
come
too
simmy
she
said
to
the
young
man
it
will
be
exciting
i
can
promise
you
not
if
i
know
it
he
said
then
he
tried
to
be
kind
and
said
what
is
the
lecture
about
the
uses
of
fiction
none
that
i
can
see
except
to
provide
some
poor
devil
with
an
income
that
a
man
view
it
is
he
said
a
man
and
not
a
monkey
you
do
call
your
literary
crowd
men
do
you
i
was
just
wondering
what
he
did
call
them
when
lady
scilly
shut
him
up
and
i
thought
she
looked
at
me
presently
he
went
on
you
quite
spoiling
your
set
you
know
paquerette
i
used
to
enjoy
your
receptions
i
do
see
why
you
should
permit
yourself
to
abuse
my
set
because
you
a
fifth
cousin
that
the
worst
of
being
well
connected
so
many
people
think
they
have
the
right
to
lecture
one
all
the
better
for
you
my
dear
do
you
suppose
now
that
if
you
were
not
niece
to
a
duke
and
cousin
to
a
marquis
that
society
would
allow
you
to
fill
your
house
with
people
like
morrell
aix
and
ptomaine
and
ve
lady
scilly
jumped
up
and
said
she
must
go
and
dress
and
if
he
come
to
the
lecture
he
must
go
and
pushed
me
out
of
the
room
in
front
of
her
and
on
she
called
to
him
over
the
bannisters
let
yourself
out
and
do
steal
the
spoons
that
was
a
funny
thing
to
say
to
a
friend
not
to
say
a
relation
we
went
up
into
her
bedroom
and
her
old
nurse
i
suppose
it
was
her
nurse
for
she
wore
no
cap
and
bullied
her
like
anything
came
forward
put
me
into
another
gown
miller
she
said
flopping
into
a
chair
miller
did
putting
the
skirt
over
her
head
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
and
even
pulling
her
stockings
up
for
her
then
she
had
a
try
at
tidying
me
do
bother
the
child
all
right
she
so
pretty
she
can
wear
anything
i
think
personal
remarks
rude
even
if
she
does
think
me
pretty
but
i
said
nothing
she
looked
at
herself
very
hard
in
the
glass
and
we
went
and
got
into
the
motor
again
lady
scilly
sat
with
her
hand
in
mine
and
a
funny
little
spot
of
red
on
the
top
of
the
bone
of
her
cheek
that
i
had
noticed
there
before
it
was
real
chapter
iv
we
went
into
a
house
and
into
a
large
empty
room
with
whole
streets
of
coggley
chairs
and
a
kind
of
pulpit
thing
in
the
middle
a
jug
of
water
and
a
tumbler
stood
on
it
there
was
a
person
present
presiding
over
this
emptiness
whom
lady
scilly
immediately
began
to
order
about
she
was
the
secretary
of
the
club
and
lady
scilly
is
a
member
of
the
committee
where
will
you
sit
lady
scilly
said
this
person
and
she
asked
a
good
many
other
questions
using
lady
scilly
name
very
often
i
shall
sit
quite
at
the
back
this
time
lady
scilly
answered
too
many
friends
immediately
near
him
might
put
the
lecturer
out
as
she
said
this
she
looked
at
me
wickedly
but
i
could
not
think
why
we
then
went
away
and
read
the
comic
papers
for
a
little
until
the
place
had
filled
in
the
we
met
a
gentleman
who
seemed
to
be
a
great
friend
of
lady
scilly
he
spoke
to
me
while
she
was
discussing
some
arrangement
or
other
with
the
secretary
who
had
followed
her
how
do
you
like
going
about
with
a
fairy
he
asked
me
i
not
i
said
she
a
woman
old
enough
to
know
worse
he
interrupted
me
she
is
what
i
call
a
fairy
what
is
a
fairy
i
asked
though
he
seemed
to
me
very
silly
and
only
trying
to
make
conversation
a
fairy
is
a
person
who
always
does
exactly
as
she
likes
and
as
other
people
sometimes
do
like
i
see
i
said
as
usual
although
i
did
not
see
as
usual
just
as
people
do
but
she
is
pretty
when
she
is
old
i
wonder
if
you
will
grow
up
a
fairy
no
i
think
not
you
do
look
as
if
you
tell
a
lie
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
he
then
remarked
that
lady
scilly
had
sent
him
to
take
me
into
the
room
where
the
lecture
was
to
be
given
and
we
went
of
course
i
politely
tried
to
let
age
go
first
but
he
did
like
that
and
said
and
aux
and
ad
every
language
under
the
sun
winding
up
with
that
silly
old
story
about
the
polite
lord
stair
who
was
too
polite
to
hang
back
and
keep
the
king
waiting
oh
yes
i
know
that
story
i
said
just
to
prevent
him
going
on
bothering
it
in
ollendorff
the
was
quite
full
and
we
lady
scilly
and
i
squeezed
ourselves
in
at
the
back
in
a
kind
of
cosy
corner
there
was
and
we
were
almost
in
the
dark
sit
tight
child
whatever
happens
she
kept
saying
and
held
my
hand
as
if
i
should
run
away
when
among
a
rain
of
claps
the
lecturer
came
in
i
saw
why
for
it
was
george
lady
scilly
grabbed
my
arm
and
said
do
call
out
child
as
if
i
was
going
to
but
now
i
saw
why
she
had
kept
calling
him
the
lecturer
instead
of
saying
his
name
whenever
she
had
spoken
of
him
before
now
i
saw
why
she
was
so
full
of
nods
and
winks
and
grins
and
had
brought
me
to
the
lecture
so
particularly
now
i
saw
why
the
old
gentleman
had
called
her
a
fairy
that
meant
a
tease
and
i
was
going
to
gratify
her
by
seeming
upset
or
anything
not
i
so
i
sat
quite
still
as
she
told
me
and
george
began
i
borrowed
a
pencil
of
the
ollendorff
man
and
put
down
some
notes
to
remind
me
of
what
george
said
for
ariadne
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
used
to
the
funny
little
voice
george
put
on
to
lecture
with
quite
different
to
his
isleworth
voice
presently
when
i
began
to
catch
on
a
little
i
found
that
the
lecture
was
all
about
novels
and
the
good
of
them
as
lady
scilly
had
said
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
said
my
father
apt
to
hold
a
group
of
quite
ordinary
uninteresting
characters
wallowing
in
their
clammy
stale
environment
like
fishes
in
an
aquarium
held
together
by
a
thin
thread
of
narrative
and
bounded
by
the
four
walls
of
the
author
experience
his
duty
is
to
enlarge
that
experience
for
to
novels
we
go
not
so
much
for
amusement
as
for
a
criticism
of
life
that
portion
of
life
which
comes
under
the
reader
own
observation
is
naturally
so
restricted
so
vastly
disproportionate
to
the
whole
great
i
do
hope
i
got
this
down
right
novelist
should
be
omniscient
and
once
i
got
these
two
great
words
all
the
rest
seemed
child
play
great
responsibility
lies
with
the
purveyors
of
this
necessary
panorama
of
existence
the
men
who
monopolize
the
furnishing
and
regulating
of
the
loud
applause
right
man
or
peradventure
the
right
he
bowed
at
lady
scilly
or
ought
to
know
so
many
sides
while
the
reader
alas
knows
but
one
and
is
so
tired
of
that
one
everybody
sighed
and
groaned
a
little
to
show
how
tired
they
were
and
george
went
on
see
my
audience
is
in
touch
with
me
it
works
both
what
works
both
ways
i
must
have
left
something
out
duchess
of
my
acquaintance
said
some
poignant
pregnant
words
as
indeed
all
her
words
are
pregnant
and
he
bowed
to
an
old
corpulent
lady
in
another
part
of
the
room
me
the
other
day
she
said
that
her
novel
of
predilection
was
not
a
society
novel
know
it
all
do
i
like
the
palm
of
my
hand
she
objected
know
how
to
behave
in
a
and
how
not
to
behave
in
a
boudoir
so
she
complained
the
substance
of
her
complaint
as
i
understand
it
is
this
what
she
wants
is
worlds
not
realized
she
wants
to
see
the
actress
in
her
the
in
her
garret
the
laundress
at
her
tub
the
burglar
at
his
here
george
made
a
little
bob
at
aix
in
the
audience
for
there
he
was
and
there
was
another
fit
of
clapping
then
he
went
on
mean
to
say
that
what
we
mostly
seek
in
fiction
is
to
be
taken
out
of
our
own
lives
and
put
into
somebody
else
to
temporarily
change
our
moral
environment
high
life
is
deeply
interested
in
what
is
going
on
below
stairs
bill
sykes
and
of
lambeth
if
they
have
any
time
for
reading
want
to
know
all
about
countesses
and
their
attendant
fancy
calling
simon
hermyre
that
highest
or
the
lowest
but
no
middle
course
is
the
novelist
counsel
of
perfection
there
is
no
second
class
in
the
literary
there
is
a
serious
issue
involved
in
this
proposition
if
for
instance
only
for
instance
for
i
am
very
sure
that
most
of
us
here
will
have
to
rely
on
imagination
not
fact
to
support
my
illustration
if
our
home
is
a
suburban
one
and
our
wildest
actual
dissipation
a
in
clapham
or
tooting
even
clapham
rise
or
upper
tooting
we
must
transport
ourselves
in
boots
to
the
better
quarters
of
london
to
visualize
the
giddy
cultured
throng
in
the
halls
of
belgravia
and
set
down
accurately
the
facile
inaccuracies
of
the
small
talk
of
mayfair
it
is
the
tale
of
the
mad
bad
great
world
that
sets
the
heart
of
the
matron
of
kennington
common
aflame
and
makes
her
waking
dreams
a
wonder
and
a
wild
desire
que
voulez
vous
she
is
our
staple
standing
reader
she
does
not
want
to
bend
her
chaste
thoughts
towards
hornsey
rise
and
cricklewood
to
envisage
stimulated
by
the
novelist
art
its
bursten
boilers
its
infant
woes
its
humdrum
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
no
she
prefers
in
her
grey
unlovely
parlour
to
gloat
over
the
morbid
sins
that
are
enacted
in
the
halls
of
fashion
the
voluptuous
sorrows
of
the
of
the
week
the
mystery
of
royal
visits
postponed
are
her
chosen
pabulum
to
all
these
novelists
whose
ways
are
cast
in
safe
and
humdrum
places
i
would
say
that
they
had
best
ignore
their
entourage
as
a
help
to
local
colour
in
this
case
character
drawing
like
charity
should
not
begin
at
home
go
out
go
out
young
man
from
thy
homely
nest
in
the
suburbs
where
the
females
of
thy
family
hang
over
their
flaccid
meat
teas
in
faded
blouses
i
think
it
was
about
here
that
i
half
got
up
quite
determined
and
lady
scilly
pinched
me
in
several
places
at
once
do
nip
me
please
i
said
i
think
somebody
ought
to
get
up
and
tell
george
he
drivelling
and
if
nobody
else
does
i
will
bless
the
child
she
said
you
may
answer
him
when
he
done
if
you
like
and
can
it
will
be
quite
amusing
i
think
that
she
really
was
a
fairy
but
never
mind
i
did
think
somebody
ought
to
stop
george
and
take
mother
side
so
i
waited
though
i
stopped
my
ears
and
would
not
listen
to
any
more
till
george
sat
down
and
the
secretary
lady
asked
if
some
one
would
care
to
answer
speech
lady
scilly
poked
me
up
and
i
got
up
so
that
george
and
all
of
them
could
see
me
and
i
did
feel
a
bit
shy
no
for
i
had
something
to
say
and
off
i
went
to
speak
up
for
mother
who
was
there
to
speak
up
for
herself
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
said
i
noticed
that
george
began
like
that
i
do
agree
at
all
with
what
the
gentleman
who
is
my
father
has
been
saying
about
tooting
upper
tooting
i
mean
he
ought
to
be
more
patriotic
as
he
lives
at
isleworth
which
is
pretty
nearly
the
same
thing
part
of
his
time
anyhow
and
i
suppose
he
need
do
it
unless
he
likes
and
as
for
what
he
says
about
mother
why
i
can
tell
everybody
that
mother
does
read
novels
about
duchesses
or
anybody
she
has
time
she
much
too
busy
in
the
house
bringing
us
up
and
cooking
specially
for
george
and
so
on
that
all
i
sat
down
with
a
bump
george
seemed
to
subside
and
i
lost
him
but
i
hardly
expected
him
to
come
and
hug
me
lady
scilly
went
and
comforted
him
perhaps
i
do
know
what
happened
except
tea
and
coffee
but
i
did
feel
inclined
and
i
asked
aix
to
take
me
home
he
did
in
a
hansom
he
held
my
hand
all
the
way
we
did
talk
but
i
am
sure
he
was
cross
with
me
and
held
my
hand
to
show
it
he
seemed
to
know
i
was
going
to
have
a
bad
time
i
did
even
mother
scolded
me
papa
did
come
near
us
for
a
week
and
when
he
was
due
i
asked
if
i
might
have
a
cold
and
be
in
bed
god
sent
me
a
real
cold
to
make
me
truthful
aunt
gerty
nursed
me
it
was
so
bad
she
read
to
me
about
thumbelina
and
boadicea
my
two
favourite
heroines
one
big
and
the
other
little
and
poetry
about
my
painted
boy
which
i
love
and
that
always
makes
me
go
to
sleep
i
believe
it
is
spelt
with
a
u
and
mean
a
child
at
all
but
i
like
it
best
my
way
we
left
behind
the
painted
buoy
that
tosses
at
the
and
madly
danced
our
hearts
with
joy
as
fast
we
fleeted
to
the
south
while
i
was
ill
though
i
missed
all
the
discussions
about
moving
and
the
results
of
the
lecture
and
all
that
ariadne
reported
what
she
could
she
said
that
mother
and
george
never
mentioned
me
but
talked
as
if
the
drains
had
gone
wrong
or
a
pipe
had
burst
or
as
if
george
had
lost
a
lot
of
money
somehow
everything
is
to
be
altered
and
the
world
will
be
when
i
get
again
though
i
suppose
that
even
if
i
did
get
a
chance
of
putting
my
word
in
i
could
alter
anything
as
i
wished
it
these
once
they
get
the
bit
between
their
teeth
chapter
v
it
is
no
fun
for
george
now
when
everybody
knows
he
is
a
married
man
lady
scilly
took
care
of
that
and
told
everybody
as
a
good
joke
and
all
her
friends
at
the
club
told
their
friends
how
george
little
girl
had
burst
into
the
middle
of
his
lecture
there
and
given
him
away
such
fun
do
you
know
it
was
fun
for
me
for
i
had
nothing
but
the
consciousness
of
a
bad
action
to
support
me
in
coventry
where
they
all
put
me
for
a
month
it
would
have
mattered
so
much
if
george
had
been
at
home
a
good
deal
about
that
time
i
think
i
prefer
george
as
a
visitor
and
so
does
elizabeth
cawthorne
though
she
says
it
is
more
natural
perhaps
for
a
gentleman
to
stop
with
his
family
though
wearing
to
the
servants
george
is
a
philosopher
he
has
been
forced
to
own
up
to
a
family
and
thus
has
lost
a
certain
amount
of
prestige
but
he
is
now
trying
a
new
line
at
any
rate
he
has
been
a
good
deal
talked
about
and
got
into
the
newspapers
and
that
will
sell
an
edition
i
should
think
he
has
a
volume
on
the
stocks
misfortunes
never
come
luckily
he
settled
to
build
a
house
a
house
that
should
express
him
and
shelter
his
family
as
well
mother
did
want
to
build
if
we
to
move
she
wanted
a
dear
little
house
on
the
river
at
datchet
or
even
at
surbiton
and
she
and
i
used
to
go
down
for
the
day
to
see
if
there
were
any
to
let
we
used
to
take
a
packet
of
sandwiches
and
a
bottle
full
of
milk
for
us
both
mother
never
hardly
touches
spirits
in
this
way
we
looked
over
heaps
of
little
earwiggeries
trimmed
with
clematises
and
pots
of
geraniums
hanging
from
the
balconies
with
their
poor
roots
higher
than
their
heads
and
manicured
lawns
right
down
to
the
water
edge
george
did
stop
our
doing
this
and
taking
so
much
trouble
i
believe
he
thought
it
amused
us
and
did
him
no
harm
but
all
the
time
he
was
hansoming
it
backwards
and
forwards
to
wood
where
he
meant
to
settle
he
quietly
chose
a
site
and
bought
it
and
was
his
own
architect
though
a
little
jortin
he
discovered
made
the
plans
from
his
dictation
he
got
no
credit
except
for
the
blunders
george
being
a
man
of
the
widest
culture
wanted
to
show
the
world
that
he
can
do
other
things
than
write
books
in
he
does
mention
writing
as
one
of
his
occupations
not
even
as
one
of
his
amusements
these
are
riding
driving
shooting
fishing
fencing
polo
rotting
and
or
at
least
that
what
his
friend
aix
read
out
to
us
one
afternoon
he
came
to
see
us
out
of
the
very
newest
edition
and
george
was
in
the
room
too
and
laughed
all
this
time
ariadne
and
i
were
kept
hard
at
it
copying
things
george
talked
of
nothing
but
atriums
and
tricliniums
and
environments
i
only
interrupted
once
when
i
said
that
they
had
never
mentioned
a
main
staircase
and
was
it
going
to
be
outside
like
those
wooden
ones
you
see
in
the
country
with
the
fowls
stepping
up
to
bed
on
them
they
thanked
me
and
added
an
inside
stairs
to
the
plan
at
once
as
soon
as
we
get
into
the
new
house
george
intends
to
raise
his
prices
he
expects
to
get
ten
pounds
per
thou
he
told
middleman
his
literary
agent
so
up
to
now
his
price
was
four
pound
ten
per
thou
for
articles
and
the
royalties
on
his
last
book
are
going
to
pay
for
the
new
house
middleman
says
george
will
be
quite
right
to
charge
establishment
charges
middleman
is
supposed
to
have
a
faint
very
faint
sense
of
humour
and
that
the
only
way
people
get
at
him
aix
says
middleman
can
run
up
an
author
sales
twenty
per
cent
in
no
time
if
he
fancies
you
personally
or
thinks
there
money
in
you
george
new
book
is
going
to
be
not
mediæval
this
time
people
have
imitated
him
and
adventures
of
sir
bore
and
sir
was
brought
out
just
to
plague
him
so
he
is
going
to
quit
that
for
a
time
he
thinks
that
the
isles
of
greece
would
be
a
good
place
to
dump
a
few
english
aristocrats
and
tell
their
adventures
on
he
will
go
abroad
soon
but
is
waiting
for
some
of
the
aristocrats
to
make
up
a
party
and
pay
his
expenses
meanwhile
cinque
cento
house
as
it
is
to
be
called
rose
like
a
thief
in
the
night
and
as
it
grew
higher
and
higher
mother
face
grew
longer
and
longer
she
refused
to
go
near
it
and
it
was
lady
scilly
who
helped
george
to
arrange
the
furniture
aunt
gerty
however
is
practical
and
tried
to
get
mother
to
take
some
interest
in
her
own
mansion
i
do
mother
said
but
at
a
distance
i
could
be
of
any
use
advising
and
whatever
i
advised
george
would
still
take
his
own
way
that
odious
woman
whom
i
thank
god
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
is
always
about
and
would
put
my
back
up
if
i
met
her
there
and
i
should
say
things
i
should
be
sorry
for
after
no
gerty
let
them
arrange
it
as
they
like
and
buy
furniture
and
set
it
up
it
is
george
own
money
he
earned
it
not
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
at
all
events
sneered
my
aunt
i
came
to
him
without
a
penny
and
i
have
the
right
to
dictate
so
much
as
the
position
of
a
wardrobe
you
the
man
lawful
wife
said
aunt
gerty
as
she
always
did
one
got
tired
of
the
expression
yes
unfortunately
said
mother
or
i
have
a
better
chance
but
i
am
going
to
fight
over
george
with
that
minx
how
mother
did
hate
lady
scilly
to
be
sure
a
person
she
had
never
seen
i
once
told
her
she
need
be
cross
with
lady
scilly
and
how
harmless
she
was
and
how
very
little
she
really
thought
of
papa
snubbed
him
even
and
treated
him
like
dirt
and
then
she
was
cross
with
and
said
george
was
a
man
of
whom
any
woman
might
be
proud
ariadne
and
i
went
over
to
the
new
house
often
to
get
measurements
for
blinds
and
curtains
and
things
at
home
mother
made
them
and
then
we
took
them
round
lady
scilly
was
always
there
from
twelve
to
two
and
george
generally
met
her
and
they
shut
themselves
into
first
one
room
and
then
another
discussing
it
vanloads
of
furniture
kept
coming
in
and
all
george
furniture
from
his
old
rooms
in
mayfair
she
kept
saying
oh
that
dear
old
marquetry
cabinet
how
i
remember
it
in
chapel
street
and
how
the
firelight
caught
it
in
the
evenings
or
else
that
sweet
little
pair
of
flemish
bellows
do
you
remember
when
you
and
i
something
or
other
she
marched
about
and
settled
everything
george
took
it
quite
mildly
and
made
jokes
at
least
i
suppose
they
were
jokes
for
he
made
her
laugh
consumedly
so
she
said
it
extraordinary
how
he
can
make
people
laugh
people
out
of
his
own
family
she
is
very
friendly
to
me
and
ariadne
and
has
promised
to
present
ariadne
at
the
next
court
it
to
please
george
if
she
does
remember
to
do
it
but
if
i
were
ariadne
i
should
refuse
till
my
own
mother
had
been
presented
first
so
that
she
could
introduce
me
herself
george
ought
to
insist
on
it
but
he
always
says
let
them
rave
and
that
means
do
as
you
like
but
do
bother
me
what
he
wo
like
will
be
forking
out
forty
pounds
for
ariadne
dress
and
it
will
end
by
her
staying
at
home
ariadne
wants
to
be
presented
badly
she
is
practising
curtseys
already
and
longing
for
the
season
to
begin
i
would
not
condescend
to
owe
even
a
pleasure
to
lady
scilly
but
ariadne
is
so
and
aunt
gerty
continually
advises
her
to
take
what
she
can
get
and
make
what
she
can
out
of
george
mash
when
well
disposed
about
easter
george
got
his
chance
lady
scilly
proposed
a
yachting
trip
in
the
mediterranean
in
somebody
yacht
that
they
were
willing
to
lend
her
on
condition
she
invited
her
own
party
and
included
them
if
i
had
a
yacht
i
would
ask
my
own
party
that
is
all
i
can
say
she
asked
george
to
go
with
them
we
sha
see
more
of
pawky
the
owner
than
we
can
help
and
you
can
have
a
study
on
board
and
write
a
yachting
novel
like
william
black
and
put
old
pawky
in
he
is
quite
a
character
you
know
with
a
gilded
liver
as
they
say
dyspeptic
and
all
that
i
ca
stand
him
but
you
might
bear
with
him
a
little
in
the
interests
of
art
george
had
no
objection
to
visiting
the
scene
of
his
new
book
at
pawky
expense
in
the
company
of
his
own
pals
and
accepted
at
once
i
wonder
if
they
will
batten
down
the
hatches
on
pawky
as
soon
as
they
get
out
to
sea
and
keep
him
there
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
it
would
be
just
like
them
george
proposed
to
mother
that
she
should
move
in
while
he
was
away
he
said
somebody
must
go
in
to
get
the
painters
out
then
he
would
come
home
fresh
and
full
of
material
and
find
his
study
organized
and
everything
ready
for
him
to
begin
he
said
there
would
be
ructions
inseparable
from
a
first
installation
and
that
would
put
him
off
work
abominably
and
spoil
the
whole
brewing
dear
said
mother
i
fear
we
shall
do
badly
without
you
you
are
a
man
at
least
but
i
be
good
and
spare
you
cheerfully
so
he
went
then
mother
set
to
work
and
was
perfectly
happy
there
was
to
be
a
sale
in
this
house
because
the
furniture
in
it
would
not
go
with
what
george
and
lady
scilly
had
chosen
for
cinque
cento
house
but
there
were
some
old
pieces
mother
could
not
do
without
her
nice
brass
bedstead
and
the
old
nursery
fender
that
ariadne
nearly
hanged
herself
on
once
in
a
fit
of
naughtiness
and
of
course
all
the
bedding
and
linen
and
kitchen
utensils
from
the
magnolias
one
could
hardly
suppose
lady
scilly
had
troubled
herself
about
that
sort
of
thing
the
greengrocer
moved
us
for
two
pounds
mother
and
aunt
gerty
and
the
cook
saw
the
things
off
at
isleworth
and
ariadne
and
i
and
kate
sarah
had
gone
and
i
never
got
any
better
reason
than
that
she
had
to
received
them
at
cinque
cento
house
mother
had
stuck
to
it
that
she
would
not
go
near
the
place
till
she
went
in
for
good
so
it
was
to
be
all
quite
new
to
her
and
aunt
gerty
ariadne
and
i
who
had
been
in
and
out
for
months
wondered
how
they
would
like
it
and
expected
some
sport
when
their
eyes
first
fell
on
it
we
had
a
long
delightful
day
of
anticipation
and
putting
things
where
they
had
to
go
and
in
the
evening
mother
and
aunt
gerty
came
they
had
got
out
of
the
train
at
swiss
cottage
and
asked
their
way
to
their
own
house
aunt
gerty
had
her
mouth
wide
open
mother
had
hers
tight
shut
she
was
not
intending
to
carp
or
pass
opinions
but
the
knocker
was
a
regular
slap
in
the
face
and
took
her
breath
away
she
tried
to
talk
of
something
else
and
whispered
to
aunt
gerty
rather
an
inconvenient
place
for
a
is
it
right
alongside
the
i
hastened
to
explain
that
that
was
the
she
saw
to
prevent
unpleasantness
mother
shivered
when
she
got
into
the
hall
which
is
vast
and
flagged
with
marble
like
a
church
it
strikes
very
cold
to
the
feet
she
said
to
aunt
gerty
mine
are
like
so
much
ice
oh
come
along
and
we
brew
you
a
glass
of
hot
toddy
aunt
gerty
said
cheerfully
it
a
bit
chilly
i
think
myself
but
like
the
big
where
the
players
aunt
gerty
is
generally
most
careful
but
she
is
apt
to
drop
a
little
h
or
so
when
she
is
excited
she
could
hardly
contain
herself
as
ariadne
and
i
had
hoped
when
she
saw
the
gilt
stairs
leading
up
into
the
study
what
price
broken
legs
why
i
shall
have
to
get
or
take
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
to
go
up
them
so
you
will
aunt
gerty
said
ariadne
it
is
one
of
george
rules
he
made
lady
scilly
even
leave
off
her
high
heels
before
she
used
them
took
off
for
her
himself
with
his
lily
hands
i
suppose
snorted
my
aunt
well
i
do
expect
you
will
find
me
treading
those
golden
stairs
very
often
i
ai
one
of
george
elect
such
wretched
things
to
keep
clean
mother
complained
the
servants
are
sure
to
object
to
the
extra
work
and
give
up
their
places
and
i
am
sure
one
ca
blame
them
and
such
good
ones
as
we
got
too
in
these
awful
times
when
looking
for
a
cook
is
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bottle
of
hay
heavens
is
the
girl
there
all
the
time
listening
to
me
kate
was
luckily
showing
elizabeth
cawthorne
the
way
about
her
kitchen
or
else
it
would
have
been
very
imprudent
to
tell
a
servant
how
valuable
she
is
mother
was
cowed
by
the
danger
she
had
escaped
but
aunt
gerty
went
on
flouncing
about
pricing
everything
and
tinkling
her
nails
against
pots
and
jugs
till
she
stopped
suddenly
and
put
her
muff
before
her
face
well
of
all
the
improper
objects
to
meet
a
lady
eye
coming
into
a
gentleman
house
who
that
mouldy
old
statue
of
i
told
her
that
was
autolycus
cover
yourself
tollie
i
would
aunt
gerty
said
going
past
him
affectedly
oh
look
lucy
at
all
those
dragons
and
cockroaches
doing
splits
on
the
brass
too
trimmed
copper
my
god
i
shall
just
have
to
clean
that
brass
myself
said
mother
i
shall
never
have
the
face
to
ask
kate
to
do
it
and
no
proper
grate
only
the
bare
bricks
left
showing
aunt
gerty
wailed
how
could
one
get
up
any
proper
fireside
feeling
over
a
contraption
like
that
the
lyceum
scenery
is
nothing
to
it
it
makes
me
think
of
shakespeare
all
the
time
so
meretricious
lady
castlewood
in
a
basket
under
mother
arm
suddenly
began
to
mew
very
sadly
aunt
gerty
had
put
robert
the
devil
down
on
the
floor
in
his
hamper
and
i
suppose
a
draught
got
to
him
for
he
spat
loudly
ariadne
and
i
let
out
the
poor
things
and
they
bounced
straight
out
on
to
the
parquet
floor
and
their
feet
slid
from
under
them
i
never
saw
two
cats
look
so
silly
well
if
a
cat
ca
keep
his
feet
on
those
wooden
tiles
said
mother
i
do
suppose
i
can
and
she
jumped
just
to
try
right
into
the
middle
of
a
little
square
of
blue
carpet
which
true
enough
slid
along
with
her
you
can
give
a
nice
hop
here
at
any
rate
cried
aunt
gerty
catching
her
round
the
waist
and
waltzing
all
over
the
room
till
both
their
picture
hats
fell
off
and
hung
down
their
backs
by
the
pins
ask
me
and
all
the
boys
and
give
a
nice
supper
and
do
us
as
well
as
the
old
villain
will
allow
you
she
was
quite
happy
that
is
just
like
an
actress
ariadne
and
i
danced
too
and
the
cats
mewed
loudly
for
strangeness
cats
hate
newness
of
any
kind
and
they
were
easy
till
i
got
some
newspaper
crackled
it
and
let
them
sit
on
it
and
then
they
were
all
right
then
mother
and
aunt
gerty
rang
the
bell
as
if
it
would
sting
them
and
got
up
some
coals
which
mother
had
had
the
forethought
to
order
in
and
lit
a
modest
little
fire
in
a
great
cave
with
brass
images
in
front
of
it
under
the
kind
of
copper
hood
it
would
draw
at
first
being
used
to
logs
and
when
it
smoked
we
threw
water
on
it
lest
we
dirtied
the
beautiful
silk
hangings
at
last
we
fetched
elizabeth
cawthorne
hout
she
said
i
like
to
see
the
fire
that
going
to
get
the
better
of
me
she
made
it
burn
sulkily
and
ariadne
and
i
went
to
a
shop
we
knew
of
round
the
corner
and
bought
tea
and
sugar
and
condensed
milk
to
make
ourselves
tea
with
the
aunt
gerty
had
brought
we
had
no
butter
or
bread
only
biscuits
luckily
so
we
could
stain
the
cinque
cento
chairs
whose
gold
trimmings
were
simply
peeling
off
them
sit
on
them
we
dared
not
they
would
have
let
us
down
on
the
floor
for
a
certainty
mother
and
aunt
gerty
had
a
high
old
time
blaming
lady
scilly
for
all
her
foolish
arrangements
and
then
we
all
went
down
to
the
kitchen
to
see
how
elizabeth
cawthorne
was
getting
on
there
she
was
in
a
rage
but
trying
to
pass
it
off
like
a
good
soul
as
she
is
well
i
never
here
a
gold
handle
to
my
door
i
shall
have
to
wipe
my
lily
hands
before
i
dare
use
it
and
a
fine
lady
of
a
dresser
that
i
shall
be
shy
to
set
a
plain
dish
on
beetles
here
do
you
ask
woman
to
kate
they
be
ashamed
to
show
their
faces
in
such
a
smart
place
as
this
i
thinking
and
what
this
couple
of
drucken
little
candlesticks
for
the
kitchen
our
kate
soon
rive
the
fond
bit
handles
from
off
them
or
she
not
the
girl
i
take
her
for
she
banged
it
hard
against
the
dresser
as
servants
do
to
make
it
break
but
it
did
and
she
looked
disappointed
mother
then
suggested
she
should
unpack
a
favourite
she
never
goes
anywhere
without
and
sent
kate
out
for
a
pound
and
a
half
of
and
cook
was
to
fry
them
for
our
dinners
the
kitchen
fire
after
all
was
the
only
one
that
would
burn
so
we
ate
our
chops
there
and
sat
there
till
ariadne
looked
like
a
picture
sitting
at
a
and
a
thing
like
a
torch
burning
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
was
thoroughly
disgusted
and
got
quite
cross
and
so
did
elizabeth
as
the
evening
went
on
she
hated
trestles
and
flambeaus
and
dark
rembrandtish
corners
and
could
lay
her
hand
on
her
things
nohow
so
that
when
we
all
went
up
to
bed
mother
said
to
her
elizabeth
you
have
been
a
bit
upset
have
you
i
wonder
we
have
managed
to
get
through
the
day
without
a
row
so
do
i
said
the
cook
heaps
of
times
i
have
given
you
warning
for
twopence
but
you
never
gave
me
ought
to
lay
hold
on
a
horrid
wind
sprang
up
and
moaned
us
off
to
sleep
i
thought
once
or
twice
of
george
out
on
the
mediterranean
on
a
tippity
yacht
and
quite
want
him
to
get
drowned
though
he
had
made
us
live
in
such
an
uncomfortable
house
i
had
tried
to
colonize
a
little
and
put
up
a
photograph
of
mother
done
at
ramsgate
in
a
blue
frame
to
make
me
feel
more
at
home
ariadne
had
hung
up
all
her
necklaces
on
a
row
of
nails
she
has
forty
there
is
one
made
of
dried
marrowfat
peas
that
she
nibbles
when
she
is
nervous
and
another
of
horse
jesses
or
whatever
you
call
them
sewn
on
red
velvet
we
have
a
bed
each
costing
they
are
apt
to
shut
up
with
you
in
them
there
is
no
carpet
in
our
room
and
there
are
not
to
be
any
we
are
to
be
hardy
nothing
rouses
one
like
a
touch
of
cold
floor
in
the
mornings
and
cools
one
on
hot
nights
better
than
the
same
our
too
is
an
odd
shape
i
tilted
all
the
water
out
of
it
on
to
the
floor
the
first
time
i
tried
to
use
it
it
must
be
french
it
is
so
small
i
shall
not
wash
my
hands
very
often
in
the
days
to
come
i
fancy
ariadne
began
to
get
reconciled
to
our
room
when
she
had
made
up
her
mind
it
was
like
the
bower
of
a
mediæval
chatelaine
or
like
princess
ursula
bedroom
in
carpaccio
but
i
prefer
early
victorian
and
cried
myself
to
sleep
next
morning
ben
come
along
he
had
stayed
all
night
at
the
hitchings
in
corinth
road
jessie
hitchings
likes
ben
best
of
the
family
she
may
marry
him
when
he
is
grown
up
if
she
likes
he
has
birth
but
no
education
so
that
will
make
them
even
the
only
glimmering
of
hope
i
see
for
ben
is
that
in
this
house
there
seems
to
be
no
bedroom
for
him
unless
it
is
a
room
at
the
top
with
all
the
water
tanks
in
it
which
makes
me
think
perhaps
george
is
going
to
send
him
to
school
for
the
present
we
have
arranged
him
a
bed
in
the
butler
pantry
ben
says
perhaps
george
means
him
to
be
butler
as
he
has
laid
it
down
as
a
rule
that
only
women
servants
are
to
be
used
in
cinque
cento
house
they
look
so
much
nicer
than
men
george
says
he
likes
a
houseful
of
waving
mother
thinks
she
can
work
a
house
best
on
one
servant
and
better
still
on
none
george
does
mind
her
having
any
amount
of
boys
from
the
home
near
here
but
that
does
suit
mother
she
says
one
boy
is
much
good
that
two
boys
is
only
one
and
a
half
and
that
three
boys
is
no
boy
at
all
i
suppose
they
get
playing
together
ariadne
and
i
would
in
their
place
i
know
and
human
nature
is
the
same
even
in
a
home
though
i
ca
call
ours
quite
that
chapter
vi
george
makes
a
point
of
refusing
to
be
interviewed
he
hates
it
unless
it
is
for
one
of
the
best
papers
then
he
says
that
it
is
a
sheer
kindness
and
that
a
successful
man
has
no
right
to
refuse
some
poor
devil
or
other
the
chance
of
making
an
honest
pound
or
two
so
he
suffers
him
gladly
he
even
is
good
enough
to
work
on
the
thing
a
little
in
the
proof
just
to
give
the
poor
fellow
a
lift
and
prevent
him
making
a
fool
of
himself
and
getting
his
facts
all
wrong
in
the
end
george
writes
the
whole
thing
entirely
from
beginning
to
end
and
makes
the
man
a
present
of
a
complete
magazine
article
and
a
very
fine
one
too
i
have
been
generous
he
tells
us
i
have
offered
myself
up
as
a
burnt
sacrifice
i
have
given
myself
all
without
reservation
i
have
nothing
extenuated
everything
set
down
in
malice
i
have
owned
to
strange
sins
that
i
never
committed
to
idiosyncrasies
that
took
me
all
my
time
to
invent
and
all
to
bump
out
an
article
by
some
one
else
i
have
been
butchered
to
make
a
journalistic
holiday
this
is
all
very
nice
and
of
george
but
this
particular
interview
read
very
well
when
it
came
out
and
made
george
seem
a
very
interesting
sort
of
man
with
some
quaint
habits
not
half
so
funny
as
his
real
ones
though
and
i
think
the
interviewer
might
just
as
well
have
given
those
so
when
i
got
a
chance
of
telling
the
truth
i
did
meaning
to
act
for
the
best
and
give
papa
a
good
show
and
save
him
the
trouble
of
telling
it
all
himself
but
nobody
gave
me
credit
for
my
good
intentions
and
kind
heart
in
the
first
place
how
dared
i
put
myself
forward
and
offer
to
see
george
visitors
but
the
young
man
asked
for
me
at
least
when
he
was
told
that
george
was
out
he
said
might
he
see
one
of
the
young
ladies
of
course
i
do
suppose
that
would
have
occurred
to
him
only
i
was
leaning
over
the
new
aluminium
bannisters
and
caught
his
eye
then
an
idea
seemed
to
come
into
his
head
the
look
of
disappointment
that
had
come
over
him
when
he
was
told
that
george
was
out
changed
to
a
little
happy
perky
look
as
if
he
had
just
thought
of
something
amusing
he
crooked
his
little
finger
at
me
as
i
slid
down
the
bannister
and
said
would
i
do
and
would
he
come
in
kate
is
a
cheeky
girl
but
even
the
cook
admits
that
kate
is
not
a
patch
upon
me
kate
evidently
think
it
quite
right
but
she
slunk
away
into
the
back
premises
and
left
me
to
deal
with
the
young
man
he
handed
me
a
card
i
thought
that
very
polite
of
him
and
frederick
and
representative
of
down
in
the
corner
explained
it
all
to
me
we
take
in
about
a
hundred
rags
and
that
the
name
of
one
of
them
it
called
because
it
booms
people
so
george
says
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
interview
my
father
i
said
i
sorry
but
he
is
out
did
you
have
an
appointment
no
i
did
said
the
young
man
right
out
i
liked
his
nice
bold
way
of
speaking
he
was
the
least
shy
young
man
i
ever
met
i
do
believe
in
appointments
the
subject
is
conscious
primed
braced
up
ready
with
a
series
of
cards
so
to
speak
which
he
wishes
to
force
on
the
patient
public
a
collection
of
least
characteristic
facts
which
he
would
like
dragged
into
prominence
it
is
as
if
a
man
should
go
to
the
dentist
with
his
mind
made
up
as
to
the
number
of
teeth
that
he
is
to
have
pulled
out
a
decision
which
should
always
rest
with
any
dentist
who
respects
himself
he
went
running
on
like
that
not
a
bit
shy
or
anything
and
amused
me
very
much
but
then
the
worst
of
that
is
you
got
no
appointment
with
george
and
he
is
not
here
to
have
his
teeth
pulled
out
i
really
so
far
was
quite
sure
if
he
was
an
interviewer
or
a
dentist
but
i
kept
calm
all
the
better
my
dear
young
lady
that
is
if
you
are
willing
to
aid
and
abet
me
a
little
then
we
shall
have
a
thundering
good
interview
i
can
promise
you
you
see
in
my
theory
of
interviewing
the
actual
collaboration
of
the
patient
shall
we
call
him
is
unnecessary
indeed
it
is
more
in
the
nature
of
an
impediment
my
method
which
of
course
i
have
very
few
opportunities
of
practising
is
to
seek
out
his
nearest
and
dearest
those
who
have
the
privilege
or
annoyance
of
seeing
him
at
all
hours
at
all
seasons
unawares
if
a
painter
is
the
wife
of
his
brush
that
i
would
question
if
an
author
the
partner
of
his
pen
do
you
take
me
yes
i
took
him
and
as
george
had
called
me
a
cockatrice
a
very
favourite
term
of
abuse
with
him
only
that
morning
and
remembering
how
she
swaggers
about
being
george
egeria
i
said
you
have
to
go
to
lady
scilly
for
that
quite
so
he
said
very
naturally
your
distinguished
parent
dedicated
his
last
book
to
her
did
he
not
did
you
approve
may
i
ask
no
i
said
people
should
always
dedicate
all
their
works
to
their
wife
whether
they
love
her
or
not
that
what
i
think
quite
so
he
said
again
i
see
we
agree
famously
and
between
us
we
shall
concoct
a
splendid
interview
but
now
if
you
would
be
so
very
good
and
happen
to
have
a
small
portion
of
leisure
at
your
disposal
i
do
what
i
can
for
you
i
said
delighted
at
his
nice
polite
way
of
putting
things
i
take
you
round
the
house
shall
i
have
you
a
kodak
with
you
would
you
like
to
take
a
snapshot
at
typewriter
certainly
if
she
is
pretty
said
the
silly
man
and
i
explained
that
miss
mander
was
out
and
that
it
was
the
machine
i
meant
he
said
one
machine
was
very
like
another
but
that
if
he
might
see
the
study
where
so
many
beautiful
thoughts
had
taken
shape
he
said
it
quite
gravely
but
i
felt
he
was
laughing
in
his
jacket
all
the
time
we
take
it
all
i
said
not
wishing
him
to
have
all
the
fine
words
and
we
will
begin
at
the
beginning
i
mean
the
atrium
he
had
a
little
in
his
hand
and
he
said
as
i
led
the
way
through
the
hall
you
wo
mind
my
writing
things
down
as
they
occur
to
me
not
at
all
i
said
if
you
will
let
me
look
at
what
you
have
written
i
see
you
have
put
a
lot
already
he
laughed
and
handed
me
his
book
and
i
read
dusky
suites
lit
by
stained
glass
windows
whose
dim
cloistral
light
falling
on
lurid
hangings
and
gorgeous
masses
of
titianesque
drapery
and
antique
ebon
panelling
irresistibly
suggest
the
languorous
mysteries
of
a
mediæval
palace
do
you
think
your
father
will
like
this
style
you
have
made
it
rather
stuffy
piled
it
on
a
good
deal
the
drapery
and
hangings
i
mean
i
said
now
that
i
know
the
sort
of
thing
you
write
i
sha
want
to
read
any
more
i
thought
you
would
he
said
taking
it
back
i
read
it
to
you
this
arras
might
lurk
benvenuto
and
his
dagger
not
ben
dagger
but
papa
bicycle
we
leave
it
there
and
keep
it
out
of
the
interview
he
said
it
would
spoil
the
unity
of
the
effect
on
through
where
the
footstep
softer
falls
than
petals
of
blown
roses
on
the
grass
i
hate
poetry
i
said
and
we
may
walk
on
that
part
of
the
carpet
for
fear
of
blurring
the
magellanic
clouds
in
the
pattern
do
you
know
anything
about
magellanic
clouds
in
carpets
no
i
confess
i
have
never
trod
them
before
he
said
becoming
all
at
once
respectful
to
me
i
expect
he
lives
in
a
garret
and
has
no
carpet
at
all
and
i
thought
i
would
be
good
to
him
and
help
him
to
bump
out
his
article
and
not
cram
him
but
tell
him
where
things
really
came
from
so
i
drew
his
attention
particularly
to
the
aluminium
eagle
and
the
pinchbeck
serpent
george
picked
up
in
wardour
street
i
left
out
george
famous
yarn
about
the
sack
of
our
ancestral
palace
in
turin
in
the
fifteenth
century
when
the
veros
were
finally
disseminated
or
dissipated
whichever
it
is
i
do
believe
it
myself
but
george
always
accounts
for
his
swarthy
complexion
by
his
italian
grandmother
aunt
gerty
says
it
is
all
his
grandmother
or
in
other
words
all
liver
we
went
into
the
study
which
is
the
largest
room
in
the
house
your
father
has
realized
the
wish
of
the
psalmist
said
man
my
feet
in
a
large
room
he
likes
to
have
room
to
spread
himself
i
said
and
to
swing
cats
books
in
i
mean
so
your
father
uses
missiles
in
the
fury
of
composition
sometimes
but
oftenest
he
swears
and
that
saves
the
books
he
mostly
swears
look
here
i
had
just
found
a
piece
of
paper
in
miss
mander
handwriting
and
on
it
was
written
selections
from
the
nervous
vocabulary
of
during
the
last
hour
man
looked
at
them
and
by
jove
these
are
corkers
he
said
then
i
thought
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
let
him
see
them
there
was
drayton
the
ironmonger
bill
lying
about
too
and
i
saw
him
raise
his
eyebrows
at
the
last
item
one
chased
brass
handle
for
that
what
i
call
being
thorough
said
man
thorough
myself
see
this
interview
when
it
is
done
he
was
thorough
he
looked
at
everything
and
particularly
asked
to
see
the
pen
george
uses
or
perhaps
he
uses
a
stylograph
he
asked
mercy
no
i
screamed
out
he
would
have
an
indigestion
this
is
his
pen
at
least
it
is
this
week
pen
george
is
wasteful
of
pens
he
eats
one
a
week
very
interesting
said
he
most
authors
have
a
fetish
but
i
never
heard
of
their
eating
their
fetish
before
this
will
make
a
nice
fat
paragraph
come
on
you
see
what
friends
we
had
become
we
went
into
the
and
i
showed
him
the
dresser
with
all
the
blue
china
on
and
the
turkey
carpet
spread
on
it
instead
of
a
white
one
that
was
how
they
had
it
in
the
middle
ages
he
sympathized
with
me
about
how
uncomfortable
mediæval
was
and
if
it
was
for
the
honour
and
glory
of
it
how
much
we
preferred
early
victoria
when
the
drawers
draw
and
the
mirrors
reflect
there
not
one
in
the
house
that
poor
ariadne
can
see
herself
in
when
she
dressing
to
go
out
to
a
party
or
chairs
that
will
bear
sitting
on
why
there
are
four
in
one
room
that
we
are
forbidden
to
sit
upon
on
pain
of
sudden
death
very
hard
lines
said
man
i
confess
that
this
point
of
view
had
not
occurred
to
me
i
shall
give
prominence
to
it
in
my
article
art
like
the
car
of
some
fanatical
juggernaut
crushing
its
votaries
yes
i
said
mother
draped
a
once
and
sneaked
photograph
into
a
plush
frame
you
should
have
heard
george
think
that
any
wife
of
his
wife
must
be
above
suspicion
and
as
for
ariadne
he
had
rather
see
her
dead
at
his
feet
than
folded
in
blue
plush
capital
said
man
all
good
grist
for
the
interview
and
now
will
you
show
me
the
famous
metal
stairs
of
which
i
have
heard
so
much
there
are
no
penalties
attached
to
that
i
trust
except
that
we
are
not
allowed
to
go
up
them
ariadne
and
me
without
taking
our
boots
off
first
for
fear
of
scratching
the
polish
we
have
to
strip
our
feet
in
the
housemaid
pantry
and
carry
them
up
in
our
hands
that
rather
a
bore
you
will
admit
and
your
father
does
he
bow
to
his
own
decrees
oh
no
i
said
papa
is
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
capital
again
remarked
man
i
am
getting
to
know
all
about
the
great
in
the
fierce
light
that
beats
upon
the
domestic
hearth
but
by
the
way
he
said
with
a
little
crooked
look
at
me
it
is
usual
shall
i
say
something
about
people
generally
like
an
allusion
just
a
hint
of
feminine
presence
say
the
mistress
of
the
house
flitting
about
tending
her
ferns
or
what
not
you
must
put
her
in
the
kitchen
then
i
said
tending
her
servants
would
you
like
to
see
her
i
should
not
like
to
disturb
her
he
said
politely
will
you
describe
her
for
me
oh
mother
nice
and
thin
a
good
figure
i
should
hate
to
have
one
of
those
mothers
do
you
know
but
i
do
really
think
you
need
describe
her
i
do
think
she
cares
about
being
in
the
interview
thank
you
but
you
may
say
that
my
sister
ariadne
is
ravishingly
beautiful
if
you
like
and
what
about
you
miss
he
asked
looking
at
me
tempe
i
said
but
whatever
you
do
do
put
me
in
george
would
have
a
fit
he
wo
much
like
your
mentioning
ariadne
but
i
do
see
why
she
should
have
a
show
if
i
can
give
her
one
very
well
he
said
your
ladyship
shall
be
obeyed
now
i
really
think
i
have
got
enough
unless
i
saw
his
eyes
straying
there
nothing
much
to
see
up
those
stairs
except
george
bedroom
and
i
dare
take
you
in
there
it
is
quite
commonplace
too
not
like
the
rest
of
the
house
but
very
comfortable
oho
your
father
reminds
me
of
the
man
who
plays
othello
and
trouble
to
black
more
than
his
face
and
arms
said
man
and
rooms
oh
our
rooms
are
cupboards
bowers
george
calls
them
and
says
we
have
more
room
to
keep
our
clothes
in
than
the
lady
of
a
mediæval
castle
would
have
now
that
all
and
the
truth
was
i
wanted
him
to
go
before
george
came
home
for
i
thought
it
might
be
awkward
for
me
if
i
were
found
entertaining
a
newspaper
man
george
might
have
preferred
to
do
his
own
interview
who
knows
this
reflection
only
just
occurred
to
me
as
all
reflections
do
too
late
man
was
very
quick
however
and
understood
me
he
thanked
me
very
much
far
more
than
he
need
for
on
reflection
i
did
not
see
how
he
was
going
to
make
an
interview
out
of
all
the
scrappy
things
i
had
told
him
and
i
said
so
he
assured
me
i
need
be
under
no
uneasiness
on
that
score
that
this
particular
interview
would
be
unique
of
its
kind
and
would
gain
him
great
credit
with
his
editor
and
increase
the
circulation
of
the
paper
if
it
had
nothing
else
he
said
it
would
at
least
have
a
de
at
least
i
think
that
is
what
he
said
for
i
do
understand
french
very
well
while
he
was
making
all
those
pretty
speeches
we
stood
in
the
hall
and
i
heard
the
little
grating
noise
in
the
lock
that
meant
that
george
was
fitting
his
key
in
and
oh
how
i
just
longed
to
run
away
but
i
did
george
opened
the
door
and
came
in
and
shook
off
his
big
fur
coat
then
he
saw
man
and
came
forward
and
man
came
forward
too
with
his
funny
little
smile
on
his
face
that
somehow
reminds
me
of
the
pied
piper
we
used
to
read
of
when
we
were
little
i
came
from
he
said
and
george
nodded
to
show
he
knew
what
for
to
ask
you
to
grant
me
the
favour
of
an
interview
i
am
sorry
i
happened
to
be
out
began
george
and
then
i
knew
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
was
a
paper
but
if
it
is
not
too
late
i
shall
be
happy
no
need
no
need
to
trouble
you
now
my
dear
sir
the
interviewer
said
waving
his
hand
a
little
i
came
and
i
go
not
empty
away
but
with
the
material
of
a
dozen
articles
of
sovereign
interest
in
my
pocket
you
left
an
admirable
in
the
person
of
your
daughter
here
who
kindly
consented
to
be
my
cicerone
and
relieved
me
of
the
necessity
of
troubling
you
will
doubtless
be
relieved
also
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
a
proof
and
before
george
could
say
what
he
wanted
to
say
cook
had
opened
the
door
for
himself
and
had
gone
i
said
he
had
plenty
of
cheek
george
said
so
too
and
a
great
deal
worse
i
was
black
and
blue
for
a
week
and
man
never
sent
a
proof
after
all
so
when
the
article
came
out
new
style
a
talk
with
miss
tempe
i
got
some
more
that
is
the
first
and
last
time
i
was
ever
interviewed
george
has
peculiar
theories
about
interviewing
i
see
and
i
shall
not
interfere
with
them
in
future
i
should
think
frederick
cook
would
get
on
making
tools
of
honest
children
to
serve
his
ambition
like
that
george
did
punish
him
of
course
he
is
a
power
on
a
paper
while
i
am
but
a
child
in
the
nursery
chapter
vii
i
wonder
if
other
families
have
got
tame
countesses
who
come
bothering
and
interfering
in
their
affairs
i
do
mind
our
having
a
party
at
all
but
i
do
hate
that
it
should
be
to
please
lady
scilly
a
party
a
party
she
said
to
george
clasping
her
hands
in
her
silly
way
my
party
on
the
table
like
the
woman
in
the
play
of
ask
all
the
dear
amusing
literary
people
that
i
adore
and
i
bring
a
large
contingent
of
smart
people
if
i
may
to
meet
them
please
i
do
know
what
a
contingent
is
but
i
fancy
it
something
disagreeable
lady
scilly
is
george
friend
not
mother
she
has
only
called
on
mother
once
and
that
was
in
the
old
house
and
then
mother
was
not
receiving
as
they
call
it
so
she
has
never
even
seen
the
mistress
of
the
house
where
she
is
going
to
give
the
party
christina
mander
george
secretary
says
that
is
quite
the
new
way
of
doing
things
and
she
has
been
about
a
great
deal
and
ought
to
know
miss
mander
is
a
lady
she
is
very
thin
one
of
those
women
you
know
that
seem
to
live
to
support
a
small
waist
that
is
their
greatest
beauty
but
when
we
first
knew
her
she
was
plump
and
we
practically
got
her
for
george
years
ago
when
we
were
quite
little
and
had
had
measles
we
were
sent
down
to
a
sort
of
at
ramsgate
to
an
old
lady
an
in
some
theatre
aunt
gerty
knew
and
who
could
neither
see
to
mend
or
to
keep
us
in
order
though
she
got
thirty
shillings
a
week
for
doing
it
they
never
got
us
up
till
nine
i
suppose
the
slavey
thought
sufficient
for
the
day
was
the
evil
thereof
and
tried
to
make
the
evil
day
as
short
as
possible
one
morning
when
it
was
quite
nine
and
the
sun
was
shining
in
ariadne
and
i
were
feeling
frightfully
bored
so
we
got
up
in
our
moved
a
wardrobe
and
found
a
door
behind
it
into
another
house
it
was
quite
a
smart
house
with
soft
plush
carpets
and
yellow
doors
we
went
all
over
it
only
the
cat
was
awake
licking
herself
in
the
the
bedroom
doors
were
all
shut
except
one
and
we
went
in
and
found
a
nice
girl
in
bed
with
her
gold
hair
all
spread
over
the
pillow
she
did
seem
shocked
at
us
but
laughed
and
when
we
had
explained
she
wished
us
to
get
into
the
bed
beside
her
it
had
sheets
trimmed
with
lace
and
her
initials
on
the
pillow
we
did
this
every
morning
till
we
went
away
she
kept
us
up
afterwards
sending
us
christmas
cards
and
so
on
and
when
george
advertised
for
a
secretary
to
help
him
to
she
answered
it
among
the
thousand
others
and
we
remembered
her
name
and
made
george
engage
her
she
had
been
to
girton
and
to
a
journalistic
school
and
dancing
academy
and
to
klondike
where
all
her
hair
got
cut
off
so
that
she
has
enough
to
spread
over
the
pillow
now
and
behind
the
scenes
at
a
and
a
month
on
the
stage
and
edited
a
paper
once
and
wrote
a
novel
all
before
she
was
thirty
at
every
new
arrangement
for
amusement
she
made
her
people
opposed
her
and
prayed
for
her
in
church
but
she
always
got
her
own
way
in
the
end
her
mother
stephen
cadwallis
mander
came
here
to
sniff
about
when
george
first
took
christina
on
she
is
a
woman
of
the
world
and
all
but
she
took
to
mother
at
first
sight
and
talked
to
her
quite
naturally
about
this
new
move
of
dear
christina
she
spoke
in
a
neat
sighing
voice
and
told
us
that
christina
had
developed
early
and
was
so
different
to
her
other
children
she
kept
on
saying
the
name
of
george
new
magazine
as
if
it
shocked
her
very
much
oats
such
a
crude
name
though
i
suppose
she
must
sow
them
somewhere
and
best
perhaps
in
the
pages
of
a
magazine
you
look
after
her
wo
you
is
there
any
danger
she
looked
towards
the
of
her
falling
in
love
with
her
employer
she
laughed
carelessly
not
the
slightest
said
mother
laughing
too
she
will
have
her
eyes
opened
that
all
to
the
seamy
side
of
artistic
life
my
daughter
is
so
absurdly
curious
about
that
wretched
seamy
side
after
all
it
only
the
side
that
the
workers
leave
the
knots
on
they
must
be
somewhere
just
as
plates
must
be
washed
up
in
a
scullery
but
we
do
need
to
go
in
and
gloat
on
the
horrid
sight
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
mother
only
if
one
happens
to
be
the
aunt
gerty
came
in
just
then
and
took
her
part
in
the
conversation
i
was
glad
to
see
she
was
dressed
more
quietly
than
usual
and
said
mander
she
buys
everything
that
comes
out
especially
magazines
that
talk
about
the
of
progress
and
look
just
as
if
they
were
produced
in
the
dark
ages
i
know
that
she
came
to
your
husband
entirely
because
she
wanted
to
help
to
edit
his
magazine
is
not
that
its
name
from
what
chris
says
it
sounds
so
advanced
oh
very
said
aunt
gerty
but
it
wo
live
you
do
say
so
mander
put
up
her
and
looked
at
aunt
gerty
whom
she
already
did
like
none
of
my
things
do
aunt
gerty
went
on
calmly
he
is
a
prize
wrecker
of
women
and
magazines
mander
looked
startled
and
mother
tried
to
change
the
conversation
oh
he
a
law
unto
himself
my
is
went
on
aunt
gerty
but
i
do
think
he
convert
miss
mander
to
his
views
i
hope
not
said
mander
for
i
notice
that
if
you
make
a
law
unto
yourself
you
generally
have
to
make
a
society
unto
yourself
too
at
least
as
far
as
women
are
concerned
people
will
always
let
you
go
your
own
way
said
mother
but
the
point
is
will
they
come
with
you
join
with
you
in
a
pleasant
walk
well
said
mander
my
daughter
is
the
most
headstrong
of
young
women
i
ca
control
her
or
you
may
be
sure
i
should
not
have
allowed
her
to
undertake
this
post
of
secretary
to
mr
i
gathered
as
much
said
mother
not
offended
a
bit
but
i
will
look
after
her
well
she
does
she
gives
her
oil
every
day
to
make
her
fat
and
breakfast
in
bed
once
a
week
christina
says
lady
scilly
is
a
female
mecænas
ben
says
she
a
minx
ben
hates
her
because
she
makes
a
fool
of
george
and
he
says
ariadne
is
a
cad
to
accept
her
old
dresses
and
wear
them
and
go
out
with
her
but
then
what
is
ariadne
to
do
she
likes
to
go
to
parties
and
mother
wo
go
anywhere
she
is
quite
obstinate
about
that
i
must
say
that
george
does
try
to
persuade
her
much
you
see
he
is
used
to
having
a
wife
socially
speaking
after
going
about
as
a
bachelor
all
those
years
george
agreed
to
have
a
party
here
to
please
lady
scilly
but
christina
is
quite
sure
that
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
already
for
why
should
he
build
a
house
for
purposes
of
advertisement
and
then
hide
it
under
a
bushel
a
successful
party
is
more
good
than
fifty
interviews
so
she
says
and
sells
an
edition
she
knows
a
great
deal
about
geniuses
she
says
the
would
not
suit
george
i
asked
her
what
the
was
she
said
she
had
known
an
artist
who
took
a
lovely
old
house
in
the
suburbs
of
london
and
lived
there
and
never
went
out
anybody
who
cared
must
come
out
to
see
him
and
then
it
was
not
so
easy
for
his
sundays
were
only
for
a
select
few
very
selected
he
only
gave
tea
and
very
little
butter
and
no
plain
living
and
high
prices
for
his
pictures
cost
a
lot
though
he
pretended
he
did
not
care
if
he
sold
them
or
not
in
fact
it
cut
him
to
the
heart
to
see
any
of
them
go
out
into
the
great
cold
brutal
world
and
he
never
exhibited
in
exhibitions
but
in
an
empty
room
in
his
own
house
he
said
in
fun
i
suppose
that
if
the
academy
were
to
elect
him
to
be
an
he
should
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
his
solicitors
the
end
of
that
man
was
she
said
that
he
did
become
a
royal
academician
quite
against
his
will
and
princes
and
princesses
of
the
blood
used
to
come
and
have
tea
with
him
without
a
but
that
would
not
do
for
george
for
he
is
at
all
and
he
can
make
epigrams
they
say
that
is
his
i
hate
them
myself
i
think
they
are
rude
and
only
a
clever
way
of
hurting
people
feelings
so
that
they
ca
complain
but
then
of
course
the
family
gets
them
in
the
rough
epigrams
like
charity
begin
at
home
george
began
to
talk
a
great
deal
about
the
duty
of
entertaining
he
said
a
man
owed
it
to
his
century
and
his
party
must
be
something
out
of
the
common
run
it
must
be
individual
and
exceptional
he
thought
he
would
give
a
party
like
the
ones
they
gave
in
the
middle
ages
judging
from
what
he
said
i
think
that
it
must
have
been
very
uncomfortable
and
very
expensive
for
to
be
really
grand
you
had
to
have
cygnets
and
peacocks
to
eat
people
stood
about
round
the
sides
of
the
room
or
sat
on
the
floor
or
on
coffers
and
before
the
evening
was
half
over
the
smoke
from
the
flambeaux
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
see
each
faces
that
did
suit
ariadne
at
all
and
she
snubbed
the
idea
as
much
as
she
could
luckily
george
changed
his
mind
and
then
it
was
to
be
a
supper
still
mediæval
at
six
we
should
have
had
to
eat
with
our
fingers
because
only
the
carver
has
a
fork
and
he
sometimes
lends
it
but
it
ca
go
all
round
that
the
reason
we
have
now
and
little
bits
of
bread
beside
our
plates
instead
of
big
bits
of
brown
to
eat
off
and
when
you
were
done
did
you
eat
the
plate
as
far
as
i
can
see
everybody
handed
everybody
they
loved
nice
pieces
off
their
own
trenchers
and
drank
out
of
the
same
glasses
so
the
fewer
persons
that
loved
one
the
better
i
should
have
liked
it
you
should
have
seen
mother
face
when
the
menu
was
explained
to
her
she
said
she
would
do
what
she
could
but
how
was
she
going
to
put
the
and
the
butchers
shops
back
a
century
the
first
course
george
explained
was
quite
easy
it
was
little
bits
of
toast
with
honey
and
hypocras
perhaps
they
will
know
what
that
is
at
the
stores
mother
said
meaning
to
be
funny
there
a
very
civil
young
man
there
might
help
me
next
course
smoked
eels
went
on
george
any
soup
you
like
only
it
must
be
flavoured
with
verjuice
that
is
the
third
course
then
you
have
venison
rabbits
pigeons
fricasseed
beans
river
crabs
sorrel
oranges
capers
in
vinegar
it
will
relieve
us
for
ever
of
the
burden
of
entertaining
for
ever
and
ever
that
one
good
thing
mother
said
for
nobody
will
care
to
try
that
twice
it
would
look
well
in
the
papers
though
george
said
what
do
you
say
to
barbecued
pig
but
mother
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
barbecued
pig
and
george
and
lady
scilly
finally
settled
that
it
was
to
be
a
masked
ball
costume
not
obligatory
but
masks
and
dominos
imperative
with
a
cold
collation
at
twelve
and
all
the
guests
to
unmask
then
the
date
was
chosen
to
please
her
and
it
was
changed
three
times
but
at
last
it
was
fixed
and
george
got
some
cards
printed
that
he
had
designed
himself
they
were
quite
white
and
plain
but
with
a
knowing
red
splotch
in
one
corner
which
signified
george
passionate
italian
nature
i
was
in
the
study
when
the
first
dozens
of
packets
came
with
miss
mander
and
she
undid
them
secretaries
always
take
the
right
to
open
everything
my
goodness
she
said
is
it
right
i
asked
getting
hold
of
it
but
when
i
had
looked
at
it
i
was
no
wiser
for
i
could
see
what
was
wrong
there
it
was
written
out
very
nicely
at
home
wednesday
the
and
the
address
in
the
corner
and
all
those
rules
about
the
dominos
and
that
was
all
oh
dear
darling
christina
i
begged
deadly
curious
do
tell
me
what
is
wrong
with
that
i
can
not
guess
it
just
as
well
perhaps
she
said
preserve
your
sublime
ignorance
my
dear
child
as
long
as
you
can
and
not
another
word
could
i
get
out
of
her
i
suppose
she
calls
that
being
loyal
to
her
employer
i
told
ben
and
he
said
he
knew
and
what
was
more
he
would
go
one
better
he
got
hold
of
one
of
the
cards
and
altered
it
and
then
it
was
and
lady
scilly
at
i
think
that
was
absurd
for
though
lady
scilly
meddles
in
all
our
affairs
she
does
quite
live
here
yet
and
mother
does
and
what
more
mother
never
goes
out
at
all
except
to
take
a
servant
character
or
scold
the
butcher
or
something
of
the
sort
so
she
is
really
the
one
at
home
christina
took
it
from
him
and
looked
at
it
and
i
swear
i
saw
her
smile
before
she
tore
it
up
so
ben
had
me
there
for
he
still
would
tell
me
what
was
wrong
with
the
first
card
we
began
to
write
in
the
names
of
the
people
it
took
us
a
whole
morning
ben
ariadne
miss
mander
and
i
offered
to
help
and
really
though
i
write
rather
badly
i
can
spell
better
than
any
of
them
but
i
do
believe
they
valued
my
help
very
much
and
only
gave
me
a
card
now
and
then
to
keep
me
quiet
there
were
six
young
men
that
ariadne
wanted
asked
six
no
less
if
you
please
and
she
only
been
out
six
months
and
she
kept
trying
to
force
them
on
george
same
as
you
do
cards
in
a
card
trick
but
he
did
take
any
notice
and
kept
walking
up
and
down
the
room
mentioning
the
names
of
all
sorts
of
absurd
people
that
nobody
wanted
except
himself
it
was
really
going
to
be
a
very
smart
party
there
were
to
be
detectives
and
reporters
and
what
more
can
you
have
than
that
all
the
countesses
and
dukes
and
so
on
were
to
come
of
course
but
i
must
say
i
had
thought
that
george
knew
a
great
many
more
of
them
he
managed
to
scratch
up
so
few
considering
all
the
talk
there
had
been
about
it
i
kept
saying
oh
do
give
me
a
countess
to
ask
you
give
me
all
the
plain
people
to
do
somehow
or
other
george
did
not
seem
to
be
pleased
and
he
sent
us
all
away
after
fifty
had
been
written
next
day
he
told
us
that
he
had
thought
it
all
out
and
he
was
going
to
do
an
original
thing
and
instead
of
sending
out
cards
for
his
party
he
was
going
to
announce
it
in
the
pages
of
and
that
all
his
friends
reading
it
must
consider
themselves
bidden
mother
said
how
should
she
know
how
many
to
prepare
for
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
depends
on
the
number
of
friends
george
has
got
and
whether
they
know
that
he
considers
them
his
friends
for
think
how
awkward
to
assume
that
you
were
a
friend
and
had
a
place
laid
for
you
and
then
to
come
and
find
that
you
were
only
an
acquaintance
i
suggested
that
the
real
friends
should
have
a
hot
supper
with
wine
while
the
acquaintances
should
only
go
to
a
buffet
and
have
cold
pressed
beef
and
lemonade
there
should
be
a
password
and
and
they
roared
when
i
told
them
this
but
i
did
see
why
then
the
party
would
really
be
of
some
use
for
after
it
people
would
know
where
they
were
but
how
about
the
newspaper
people
they
could
call
themselves
friends
or
even
acquaintances
so
they
would
be
able
to
come
at
all
and
what
would
george
do
then
i
said
all
this
which
seems
to
me
very
sensible
but
no
one
noticed
it
and
the
detectives
they
have
to
be
paid
for
coming
surely
and
i
rather
see
them
than
any
of
the
others
if
they
do
come
the
party
will
be
spoilt
for
me
i
said
to
christina
it
will
be
all
right
she
said
and
ariadne
was
quite
pleased
for
of
course
this
way
her
six
young
men
can
come
a
dozen
if
they
like
ariadne
and
i
had
costumes
i
was
the
little
duke
of
gandia
that
brother
of
cæsar
borgia
that
he
killed
and
ariadne
had
the
dress
of
beatrice
cenci
with
a
sort
of
wound
round
her
head
the
funny
thing
is
that
she
looks
far
younger
than
me
in
it
quite
a
little
girl
while
i
look
like
a
big
boy
my
legs
are
very
long
george
has
a
costume
one
of
the
fratelli
dei
morti
and
it
is
much
the
same
sort
of
looking
thing
as
a
domino
nobody
would
ever
know
him
and
he
looks
very
nice
i
am
told
that
at
masques
you
have
to
speak
a
squeaky
voice
or
alter
it
somehow
george
will
have
to
because
he
has
a
very
peculiar
voice
that
anybody
would
know
a
mile
off
people
call
it
resonant
nervous
i
call
it
cracked
it
is
one
of
his
chief
fascinations
but
he
will
have
to
do
without
it
for
once
and
rely
on
the
others
the
study
was
to
be
the
only
george
preferred
to
leave
signs
of
literary
occupation
in
the
shape
of
his
desk
which
he
just
shoved
away
on
one
side
with
the
proofs
of
his
new
novel
left
negligently
lying
on
it
we
sprinkled
copies
of
his
last
but
one
about
the
house
in
moderation
it
was
rather
fun
i
felt
as
if
i
were
planting
bulbs
george
likes
these
sort
of
little
attentions
and
i
knew
i
was
not
to
be
put
off
by
his
finding
one
as
he
did
and
scolding
me
and
telling
me
to
put
it
on
the
fire
chapter
viii
about
nine
they
all
began
to
arrive
and
by
ten
the
house
was
overflowing
ben
was
a
capital
commissionaire
in
a
district
costume
he
had
borrowed
with
george
consent
and
i
do
believe
he
enjoyed
himself
most
of
anybody
of
course
at
first
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
stand
at
the
door
and
show
people
in
but
he
hoped
that
later
in
the
evening
he
should
have
to
chuck
somebody
out
it
was
likely
he
thought
for
all
the
literary
world
of
london
would
be
sure
to
be
at
our
party
i
sorry
to
say
that
ben
was
wrong
there
or
else
the
literary
people
did
come
for
those
that
did
come
were
as
quiet
as
lambs
there
were
detectives
several
of
them
and
although
i
looked
very
particularly
at
their
boots
which
i
have
always
been
told
is
the
way
to
spot
a
detective
i
saw
nothing
at
all
out
of
the
common
there
was
a
man
with
a
cloven
hoof
but
then
he
was
meant
for
the
devil
he
was
masked
of
course
but
the
devil
needs
no
domino
and
knew
all
the
time
that
it
was
the
little
man
who
interviewed
me
once
instead
of
george
for
and
got
me
into
such
a
row
and
very
devilish
of
him
it
was
and
i
had
no
butter
to
my
bread
for
a
week
because
of
him
how
i
was
supposed
to
know
that
george
hated
the
truth
instead
of
loving
it
i
ca
see
only
man
knew
well
enough
i
expect
never
again
will
i
interfere
between
a
man
and
his
interviewer
there
were
hosts
of
newspaper
people
there
i
heard
two
of
them
discussing
us
sitting
in
the
medici
seat
i
managed
to
get
jammed
in
behind
powerless
to
move
as
they
say
in
the
novels
even
if
i
had
wanted
to
people
careless
i
heard
heaps
of
conversations
anyhow
people
even
said
things
to
each
other
across
me
without
stopping
to
think
whether
or
no
i
was
one
of
the
family
i
suppose
because
they
were
masked
they
felt
anonymous
as
if
it
matter
what
they
said
and
it
need
count
afterwards
the
man
i
listened
to
was
man
dressed
as
the
devil
the
woman
domino
was
all
shot
with
queer
faint
colours
and
if
any
colour
sulphur
colour
she
was
scented
too
a
nice
odd
scent
man
seemed
to
know
her
i
can
not
be
mistaken
am
i
not
talking
to
the
most
dangerous
woman
in
london
the
woman
seemed
quite
complimented
and
smiled
under
her
mask
not
quite
but
very
nearly
she
said
i
am
a
gas
give
me
a
name
i
will
call
you
sulphuretta
hydrogen
how
does
that
suit
you
is
it
a
noxious
gas
she
said
for
honestly
i
never
am
spiteful
i
only
speak
of
things
as
i
find
them
and
one
must
send
up
bright
copy
or
one
would
be
taken
on
i
tell
the
truth
nothing
extenuate
everything
set
down
in
malice
said
he
the
devil
and
are
much
obliged
to
you
it
is
the
honest
truth
that
makes
his
work
so
easy
for
him
we
are
of
a
trade
in
more
senses
than
one
now
tell
me
ca
we
exchange
celebrities
i
give
you
my
names
and
you
shall
give
me
yours
i
suppose
all
the
world
is
here
all
the
world
and
somebody
else
wife
she
said
quickly
and
the
devil
rubbed
his
hands
but
that
is
the
rub
we
ca
know
who
they
all
are
till
twelve
and
my
idea
is
that
a
good
many
of
them
will
decamp
before
they
are
forced
to
reveal
themselves
least
seen
soonest
mended
then
we
shall
have
to
invent
them
he
said
the
very
form
of
invitation
must
lead
to
a
good
deal
of
promiscuity
can
you
tell
me
which
is
lady
scilly
she
at
least
is
sure
to
be
here
naturally
was
it
she
who
discovered
george
and
made
him
the
fashion
you
know
do
you
suppose
he
was
particularly
obliged
to
her
for
digging
his
family
out
as
well
you
naughty
man
but
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
thing
was
it
delightful
and
not
too
scandalous
to
use
for
the
man
is
really
quite
harmless
only
a
frantic
and
ah
yes
and
posed
in
london
society
for
ten
years
as
an
unmarried
man
suppose
some
nice
girl
had
gone
and
fallen
in
love
with
him
ah
but
he
was
careful
as
careful
as
a
good
has
to
be
in
the
london
season
he
lent
them
his
books
and
guanoed
their
minds
thoroughly
but
he
always
sheered
off
when
they
showed
signs
of
taking
him
seriously
chose
married
women
to
flirt
with
for
preference
what
does
the
wife
say
the
wife
so
there
is
a
wife
but
no
one
has
ever
seen
her
perpetual
or
something
of
the
sort
that
is
what
gives
out
oh
i
do
really
think
there
is
anything
in
with
lady
scilly
i
mean
he
is
too
selfish
they
are
both
too
selfish
those
sort
of
women
are
like
the
leaning
tower
they
lean
but
never
fall
it
is
an
alliance
of
interest
so
to
speak
he
introduces
the
literary
element
into
her
parties
and
writes
her
novel
for
her
and
in
return
she
flatters
him
and
takes
his
daughter
out
poor
girl
she
would
be
quite
pretty
if
she
were
properly
dressed
but
the
mediæval
superstition
you
know
she
has
to
dress
like
a
monna
somebody
or
other
so
as
to
advertise
his
books
i
believe
she
did
refuse
to
have
her
hair
shaved
off
her
forehead
la
but
she
mostly
has
to
comply
well
i
never
heard
of
a
man
using
his
daughter
as
a
before
which
is
she
sulphuretta
hydrogen
pointed
out
ariadne
whose
was
tumbling
all
over
her
eyes
she
looks
said
man
my
dear
man
said
sulphuretta
hydrogen
do
you
know
that
they
have
a
crank
about
meals
and
refuse
to
have
them
regularly
i
am
told
that
they
have
a
kind
of
a
cold
pie
always
cut
in
the
cupboard
and
they
go
and
put
their
heads
in
and
eat
a
bit
when
so
disposed
well
they
are
free
at
any
rate
free
from
the
trammels
of
custom
oh
yes
they
are
free
but
so
very
sallow
i
was
getting
pretty
much
out
of
patience
at
having
so
many
lies
told
about
my
family
and
i
was
just
going
to
contradict
that
about
the
buttery
and
the
poking
our
heads
into
a
cupboard
when
the
fat
woman
that
they
had
said
was
mother
but
whom
i
was
sure
was
not
strode
up
to
sulphuretta
hydrogen
and
said
begging
your
pardon
for
contradicting
you
madam
but
i
am
in
a
position
to
state
that
that
is
not
so
miss
ariadne
is
thin
because
she
chooses
to
be
and
thinks
it
becoming
but
i
can
assure
you
that
she
eats
her
three
meals
a
day
hearty
and
taylor
is
far
though
he
is
yellow
and
then
she
swooped
away
and
i
knew
that
it
was
elizabeth
cawthorne
but
where
on
earth
had
she
got
a
domino
and
leave
to
come
to
the
ball
i
thought
i
would
go
and
look
after
ariadne
who
i
saw
could
manage
to
make
eyes
out
of
the
holes
of
a
mask
but
i
suppose
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
she
was
doing
it
all
right
and
the
young
men
seemed
to
like
it
though
i
do
believe
young
men
marry
the
girls
who
make
eyes
at
them
best
and
as
ariadne
one
object
is
to
marry
and
get
out
of
this
house
and
have
me
to
stay
with
her
i
think
she
is
going
the
wrong
way
to
work
i
went
to
her
and
i
asked
her
where
mother
was
i
am
sure
i
do
know
she
said
crossly
i
tell
you
where
elizabeth
cawthorne
is
i
said
she
is
in
the
party
in
the
room
well
i
ca
help
that
said
ariadne
tossing
her
head
mother
ought
to
look
after
her
better
i
was
sorry
for
poor
mother
because
nobody
seemed
to
mind
about
her
in
her
own
house
and
even
her
own
daughter
did
seem
to
care
whether
she
was
in
the
room
or
not
as
for
george
he
was
looking
all
over
for
lady
scilly
and
at
last
he
thought
he
had
got
her
but
it
was
for
i
thought
i
knew
a
little
join
in
the
hem
of
the
domino
i
seemed
to
remember
having
helped
to
hem
it
they
need
say
that
eyes
ca
look
bright
in
a
mask
for
this
woman
did
she
went
up
to
george
and
she
did
speak
in
a
squeaky
voice
at
all
but
in
french
not
the
kind
of
french
she
teaches
me
but
a
thick
deep
sort
right
down
her
throat
bien
beau
masque
was
what
she
said
i
know
you
but
you
do
not
know
me
i
know
you
by
your
eyes
he
said
eyes
like
the
sea
now
lady
scilly
eyes
are
quite
common
it
is
only
the
work
round
them
that
makes
them
tell
and
that
would
be
hidden
by
the
mask
one
saw
that
george
was
talking
without
thinking
eyes
without
their
context
mean
nothing
she
said
and
then
i
knew
the
woman
was
christina
for
that
was
the
very
thing
she
had
once
said
to
ariadne
to
tease
her
she
evidently
thinks
it
good
enough
to
say
twice
come
she
said
to
george
speak
to
me
say
anything
to
me
that
the
hour
and
the
mood
permit
i
want
to
hear
how
a
poet
makes
love
madame
said
george
bowing
i
think
he
was
a
little
shocked
but
after
all
if
he
will
give
a
masked
ball
what
can
he
expect
only
i
had
no
idea
that
christina
could
have
done
it
so
well
come
she
said
again
tapping
her
foot
to
show
that
she
had
grown
impatient
come
a
madrigal
a
in
any
kind
of
china
i
fancy
it
was
then
that
george
began
to
suspect
that
it
was
lady
scilly
she
could
have
managed
that
about
ballads
and
lyrics
he
asked
her
if
she
would
lift
up
the
lace
of
her
mask
a
little
just
a
little
no
no
i
dare
not
she
cried
out
there
is
a
hobgoblin
called
ben
in
the
room
a
sort
of
lubber
fiend
who
loves
to
play
pranks
on
people
why
on
earth
do
you
send
that
boy
to
school
i
could
not
help
giggling
george
looked
cross
for
this
was
personal
and
he
took
the
first
chance
of
leaving
the
mask
side
there
was
a
buzz
of
talk
in
the
room
no
not
at
all
for
everybody
was
trying
so
hard
to
say
something
clever
and
appropriate
that
they
mostly
say
anything
but
mooned
about
trying
to
look
as
if
they
were
enjoying
themselves
hugely
and
secretly
bored
to
death
all
the
time
the
only
time
people
are
really
gay
i
observe
is
at
a
funeral
or
at
or
somewhere
where
they
particularly
should
be
jolly
i
was
thinking
sadly
about
my
dear
mother
and
wondering
where
she
was
when
i
ran
against
a
frenchman
a
real
frenchman
and
he
asked
me
where
was
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
that
showed
me
that
other
people
thought
about
her
too
i
did
answer
for
a
moment
and
he
went
on
in
a
kind
of
dreamy
voice
i
was
brought
here
to
see
an
english
interior
well
i
said
it
inside
four
walls
is
it
dieu
said
he
i
had
made
to
myself
another
idea
of
home
the
fireside
the
de
la
with
her
keys
depending
from
her
girdle
the
children
the
sacred
children
standing
round
her
crowing
there
is
any
baby
i
said
and
a
good
thing
too
but
this
is
a
party
do
you
see
and
we
are
all
playing
the
fool
and
we
shall
be
sensible
and
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
am
one
of
the
sacred
children
and
i
am
just
looking
for
my
mother
knee
to
go
and
stand
against
he
made
way
for
me
with
a
mademoiselle
and
i
went
thinking
i
would
go
and
ask
ben
at
the
door
if
he
knew
where
she
was
ben
did
know
but
he
said
that
a
woman
who
was
standing
near
the
door
letting
the
cool
blow
in
under
her
mask
and
telling
people
how
she
enjoyed
it
was
lady
scilly
she
was
standing
almost
in
the
street
with
a
man
who
was
george
there
are
tall
bushes
near
our
door
rather
pretty
at
night
though
they
belong
to
the
gardens
ben
did
know
till
i
told
him
he
is
the
stupid
child
that
does
know
its
own
father
he
told
me
what
they
had
been
saying
she
had
begun
by
asking
him
if
he
approved
of
women
wearing
ospreys
a
silly
thing
to
ask
for
what
could
he
say
but
that
he
did
being
a
poet
then
she
made
a
face
prettyish
out
of
habit
forgetting
that
it
could
be
seen
under
her
mask
and
whined
oh
i
so
sorry
it
is
the
least
wicked
thing
i
do
for
beautiful
women
i
assume
you
are
a
beautiful
woman
for
purposes
of
dialogue
george
said
there
is
no
law
of
humanity
go
on
pluck
your
red
pleasure
from
the
teeth
of
pain
yes
i
am
very
wicked
she
said
my
impulses
are
cruel
sometimes
do
you
know
i
am
almost
afraid
of
myself
as
i
am
as
we
all
are
said
george
why
am
i
so
very
terrible
what
do
i
do
to
you
speak
to
me
why
are
you
so
guarded
so
unenterprising
she
cast
a
stage
glance
round
it
was
very
funny
but
george
knew
that
ben
was
the
commissionaire
and
lady
scilly
did
so
she
could
think
why
george
was
so
stiff
in
fact
if
george
had
only
known
it
he
was
if
that
is
the
way
to
put
it
for
there
was
me
too
ben
and
i
enjoyed
it
hugely
but
i
do
think
george
did
because
he
could
not
quite
make
a
fool
of
himself
before
ben
besides
it
was
draughty
out
there
and
george
takes
cold
easily
he
kept
trying
to
get
her
to
come
in
and
she
pretended
to
be
babyish
and
would
she
said
she
had
never
been
out
in
the
open
street
at
midnight
in
her
life
before
and
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
that
it
was
a
romeo
and
juliet
night
or
some
rot
of
that
sort
and
that
she
might
never
have
such
an
opportunity
again
but
poor
george
felt
he
could
not
play
romeo
because
of
ben
and
there
was
nothing
to
climb
except
a
that
led
to
nothing
since
juliet
was
standing
in
the
gutter
below
it
george
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
in
ten
minutes
they
will
give
the
signal
for
the
removal
of
masks
had
you
not
better
i
shall
leave
the
party
she
said
i
shall
walk
straight
home
it
will
spoil
all
the
effect
of
this
enchanted
night
if
we
have
to
meet
again
in
the
glare
of
the
lights
are
shaded
george
put
in
i
alluded
to
the
glare
of
publicity
she
said
i
shall
ask
this
commissionaire
she
said
to
call
my
carriage
better
not
said
george
hastily
for
you
would
have
to
give
him
your
name
your
name
which
i
know
for
my
sake
wo
you
slip
back
into
the
and
submit
to
the
ordeal
as
i
know
it
is
of
unmasking
like
the
rest
believe
me
it
is
best
it
is
my
host
commands
is
it
not
she
said
slyly
to
show
him
that
she
had
known
it
was
he
all
the
time
and
ran
past
him
in
a
skittish
way
as
if
he
had
known
all
the
time
that
she
knew
that
he
knew
that
she
knew
who
he
was
people
do
waste
so
much
time
in
pretending
well
i
thought
if
masks
were
going
to
be
removed
i
had
better
take
up
a
position
at
once
say
beside
miss
mander
which
seemed
suitable
and
i
went
in
then
i
saw
lady
scilly
again
and
wanted
so
to
know
what
she
was
up
to
she
was
stealing
out
of
the
room
and
the
devil
was
going
with
her
he
was
man
of
course
only
i
did
know
she
knew
him
they
were
talking
very
earnestly
you
know
the
way
she
was
asking
him
i
know
the
house
like
the
inside
of
a
glove
he
said
and
indeed
he
did
for
had
i
taken
him
all
over
it
the
day
he
interviewed
me
instead
of
george
and
there
was
a
row
i
think
he
is
mischievous
rather
like
puck
was
in
night
so
i
thought
i
would
stick
to
them
lady
scilly
wanted
to
go
into
an
empty
room
to
take
off
her
mask
and
domino
that
i
could
quite
understand
as
she
had
behaved
so
badly
in
both
man
offered
to
show
her
the
way
to
george
sanctum
you
see
you
can
go
where
you
like
in
a
or
ought
to
be
able
to
it
is
public
property
the
property
of
the
press
at
any
rate
the
press
is
too
much
with
us
soon
and
late
said
she
laughing
ah
but
confess
my
lady
you
ca
do
without
us
said
this
awful
young
man
though
i
suppose
he
has
to
be
cheeky
so
as
to
get
his
nose
in
everywhere
in
the
interest
of
his
paper
you
suffer
us
gladly
i
do
suffer
at
all
i
should
allow
you
to
make
me
suffer
said
she
not
understanding
him
smart
women
never
do
understand
things
out
of
the
bible
i
followed
them
my
excuse
was
that
i
wanted
to
see
they
did
steal
the
spoons
they
made
the
coolest
remarks
as
they
went
i
have
never
been
beyond
the
first
floor
in
this
house
of
awe
said
man
have
you
it
seems
to
get
more
and
more
comfortable
and
less
eccentric
as
one
goes
up
said
lady
scilly
art
is
only
said
man
just
look
at
that
bed
which
seems
to
me
to
have
come
from
nothing
more
dangerously
subversive
or
artistic
than
staple
come
lay
down
your
mask
and
domino
and
let
us
go
down
again
and
wait
about
in
the
back
precincts
till
we
hear
our
host
give
the
word
for
unmasking
so
they
marched
out
of
george
bedroom
for
that
was
where
they
had
got
to
and
as
no
one
ever
need
see
that
he
has
it
quite
comfortable
and
modern
and
sneaked
by
a
different
way
i
followed
them
soon
they
got
quite
lost
and
were
heading
straight
for
the
kitchen
i
wondered
if
elizabeth
had
taken
off
her
domino
and
gone
back
to
her
work
for
though
the
supper
was
all
sent
in
from
a
shop
there
would
be
sure
to
be
something
for
her
to
do
these
two
marched
straight
in
and
i
after
them
and
found
themselves
in
a
blaze
of
light
and
an
empty
kitchen
for
the
moment
only
for
one
heard
all
the
men
stumping
along
from
the
on
the
other
side
and
the
rinsing
something
in
the
scullery
just
as
lady
scilly
and
man
burst
in
mother
was
standing
alone
in
a
checked
apron
before
the
and
turned
right
round
and
looked
at
them
she
looked
dignified
and
cold
in
spite
of
the
kitchen
fire
which
had
caught
her
face
on
one
side
lady
scilly
and
man
took
no
notice
of
her
but
walked
about
looking
at
things
and
so
this
is
the
poet
kitchen
lady
scilly
said
rather
scornfully
how
his
pots
shine
very
comfortable
indeed
said
frederick
cook
he
seemed
to
despise
george
then
he
continued
laughing
under
his
mask
it
no
end
of
a
privilege
to
see
the
humble
objects
that
minister
to
the
poet
use
this
is
his
and
mother
made
a
little
step
forward
and
finished
cook
sentence
for
him
and
this
is
his
dresser
and
this
is
his
boiler
that
is
his
cat
and
i
his
wife
lady
scilly
skooted
cook
stayed
behind
and
did
a
little
bit
of
polite
he
is
a
bad
sort
and
mother
rather
liked
him
after
that
and
he
began
to
come
here
chapter
ix
smart
women
like
having
a
fluffy
dog
or
a
child
to
drive
with
them
in
the
afternoons
lady
scilly
has
got
either
of
her
own
so
she
is
always
borrowing
me
and
sending
for
me
to
lunch
and
drive
she
seldom
asks
ariadne
because
ariadne
is
out
and
nearer
her
own
age
too
near
that
what
i
tell
ariadne
when
she
is
jealous
and
makes
me
a
scene
about
it
and
it
is
true
if
it
were
not
for
the
honour
and
glory
of
the
thing
i
do
care
so
very
much
about
it
myself
lady
scilly
motor
is
always
getting
into
trouble
because
it
is
so
highly
bred
i
suppose
we
run
into
something
live
or
else
the
kerb
most
times
we
are
out
and
it
extremely
agitating
though
i
must
say
she
never
screams
though
once
she
fainted
after
it
was
all
over
it
is
a
mark
of
breeding
to
get
into
scrapes
but
not
make
a
fuss
we
have
all
heard
about
it
she
is
just
as
much
before
the
public
as
my
father
though
in
a
different
way
i
read
an
interview
with
her
in
the
other
day
she
had
to
start
some
cottage
homes
at
ealing
to
get
herself
into
that
and
it
said
that
hers
was
one
of
the
oldest
names
in
england
and
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
hundred
earls
now
i
call
that
nonsense
for
how
could
she
be
there
is
room
for
a
hundred
earls
since
the
heptarchy
unless
they
were
all
at
the
same
time
and
that
is
not
likely
lord
scilly
is
very
well
born
too
he
the
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
fowey
the
earl
keeps
him
very
tight
so
they
have
to
get
along
with
expectations
and
a
title
till
the
old
man
dies
and
lady
scilly
wishes
he
would
but
lord
scilly
does
because
he
not
quite
a
beast
he
is
very
nice
and
rather
fond
of
lady
scilly
though
he
is
always
scolding
her
that
is
the
expectations
they
spoil
the
temper
i
fancy
i
have
heard
that
he
does
think
it
dignified
the
way
she
goes
on
lowering
herself
and
turning
his
house
into
a
menagerie
he
does
understand
why
she
pets
authors
and
publishers
the
authors
help
her
to
write
novels
and
the
publishers
publish
them
for
love
and
ninety
pounds
george
is
writing
one
for
her
now
and
he
goes
to
her
place
nearly
every
morning
to
see
about
it
lord
scilly
does
mind
in
the
least
her
collaborating
with
george
and
the
others
it
keeps
her
out
of
mischief
but
i
expect
he
would
be
down
upon
her
at
once
if
she
were
to
collaborate
with
one
of
her
own
class
that
would
be
different
i
shall
be
glad
when
the
book
is
finished
for
elizabeth
cawthorne
who
tells
me
everything
does
think
so
much
collaborating
is
quite
what
is
due
to
mother
and
that
if
she
were
the
mistress
blessed
if
let
herself
be
put
upon
by
a
countess
elizabeth
says
lady
scilly
is
a
daisy
that
what
her
name
means
paquerette
that
what
she
tells
me
to
call
her
i
am
proud
to
call
a
person
by
her
christian
name
and
a
titled
lady
too
and
it
makes
ariadne
jealous
which
does
her
good
and
keeps
her
down
paquerette
treats
ariadne
on
quite
another
footing
any
one
can
see
she
is
not
nearly
so
intimate
with
her
as
she
is
with
me
i
go
there
at
all
times
and
seasons
and
i
accept
no
benefits
from
her
i
wo
if
she
gives
me
things
i
take
them
and
give
them
to
ariadne
so
i
feel
i
may
say
and
think
what
i
like
of
her
while
amusing
myself
with
her
and
listening
to
all
the
silly
things
she
says
the
funny
thing
is
i
am
always
trying
to
be
and
she
is
always
trying
to
be
childish
the
other
day
when
i
got
to
curzon
street
about
twelve
lady
scilly
had
sent
a
messenger
for
me
she
was
still
in
bed
in
the
loveliest
down
to
where
the
came
up
to
and
she
was
writing
her
letters
in
pencil
on
a
trying
to
squeeze
a
few
words
in
round
a
great
sprawling
gilt
monogram
that
took
up
nearly
all
the
paper
there
were
three
french
books
on
the
bed
they
had
covers
with
ladies
with
red
mouths
and
all
their
hair
down
and
femme
was
the
name
of
one
and
another
lady
scilly
says
she
always
gets
up
all
her
history
and
philosophy
in
french
if
possible
so
as
to
improve
her
grasp
of
the
language
there
was
also
on
the
pillow
a
box
of
cigarettes
and
a
great
bunch
of
lilies
that
made
me
feel
sleepy
there
are
daisies
worked
all
over
the
curtains
and
the
counterpane
and
great
bunches
of
them
painted
on
the
mirrors
hanging
head
downwards
and
about
three
sets
of
brush
things
spread
out
on
the
as
for
photographs
i
never
saw
so
many
in
my
life
there
are
about
a
dozen
cabinets
with
to
darling
from
kitty
london
and
as
many
more
with
best
love
yours
cordially
gladys
margate
and
i
have
given
up
trying
to
count
the
ones
of
actresses
then
the
men
there
is
one
of
the
poet
with
the
bumpy
forehead
and
wrinkly
trousers
who
wrote
sorrows
of
the
and
one
of
the
who
wrote
in
the
divorce
the
ollendorff
man
i
call
him
and
one
of
the
men
who
did
the
gaiety
play
called
which
lady
scilly
acted
in
the
provinces
once
for
a
charity
till
lord
scilly
stopped
her
there
he
is
in
his
volunteer
uniform
looking
like
a
lamb
i
do
like
lord
scilly
and
i
think
he
put
upon
so
i
am
as
nice
to
him
as
i
can
be
when
i
see
him
which
is
often
he
never
comes
into
her
room
where
i
principally
am
there
a
desk
in
one
corner
where
she
writes
her
little
notes
i
suppose
she
ever
wrote
a
real
letter
in
her
life
her
handwriting
is
so
big
it
would
burst
the
and
there
are
two
sorts
of
racks
on
it
one
to
hold
her
bills
that
she
has
paid
and
that
got
printed
on
it
in
gold
horrors
and
another
with
those
she
has
paid
with
heaven
on
it
though
that
one
is
mostly
empty
she
never
hardly
pays
bills
she
says
it
is
waste
of
tissue
and
bad
form
but
sends
something
on
account
and
that
i
think
is
a
very
good
way
for
however
broke
you
are
you
must
go
on
ordering
dresses
else
the
dressmaker
would
close
your
account
and
if
you
only
go
on
long
enough
the
chances
are
you
die
first
and
leave
a
nice
little
bill
behind
you
that
being
dead
you
ca
be
expected
to
pay
i
hate
kissing
people
in
bed
i
nearly
always
tumble
over
them
and
also
if
they
are
writing
i
ca
help
seeing
what
it
is
and
then
if
it
is
and
i
do
feel
awkward
but
when
she
had
said
how
do
you
do
she
handed
me
the
write
for
me
dear
she
said
to
the
most
odious
woman
in
london
and
the
most
insolent
and
the
most
unwashed
insolent
yes
positively
she
dared
to
play
lady
ildegonde
in
devey
at
a
at
camberwell
yesterday
in
perfect
dreams
of
dresses
stood
by
the
management
of
course
and
nails
like
a
now
do
you
think
that
as
the
part
of
lady
ildegonde
was
admittedly
written
round
my
personality
with
my
entire
consent
that
it
is
an
outrage
for
irene
lauderdale
to
dress
the
part
better
than
i
can
afford
to
do
i
shall
not
forgive
her
now
you
write
thing
do
be
surprised
i
afford
to
quarrel
with
her
unfortunately
were
wonderful
yesterday
i
know
what
what
and
believe
me
that
it
i
mean
the
dresses
but
she
will
think
i
mean
her
playing
that
is
what
we
call
diplomacy
do
say
any
more
short
and
spiteful
now
seal
it
i
will
see
that
ptomaine
guys
lauderdale
in
romeo
tommy
will
do
anything
for
me
and
will
do
anything
for
her
we
will
go
and
see
her
this
very
afternoon
i
must
get
up
i
suppose
ring
for
miller
dear
oh
good
heavens
how
bored
i
am
she
threw
one
of
the
french
novels
they
were
library
books
so
it
did
matter
across
the
room
and
it
fell
into
the
and
then
she
seemed
to
feel
better
i
wish
i
could
do
without
miller
she
said
old
miller
hates
me
and
i
loathe
her
but
she
will
never
leave
me
too
good
for
that
she
always
folds
up
my
frocks
as
if
she
knew
they
would
belong
to
her
one
day
so
they
will
i
ca
afford
to
quarrel
with
a
woman
who
can
do
my
hair
carelessly
with
a
single
what
am
i
going
to
wear
miller
well
said
miller
she
scotch
and
she
is
rather
stingy
of
ladyships
there
your
blue
that
come
home
last
week
it
seems
a
pity
to
leave
it
aside
just
yet
you
mean
you
can
do
without
it
a
little
longer
eh
miller
no
i
put
that
on
it
too
big
for
me
since
massage
i
simply
swim
in
it
then
there
is
the
grey
oh
that
as
i
call
it
no
it
makes
me
look
like
my
own
maid
no
offence
to
you
miller
i
do
intend
to
take
any
my
lady
said
miller
pursing
up
her
lips
what
about
your
black
with
sequins
yes
let
have
the
vicious
sequins
it
will
go
with
the
child
hair
you
see
i
dress
to
you
my
dear
but
i
knew
it
was
only
that
she
likes
things
to
go
nicely
together
just
as
she
chooses
her
horses
to
be
a
pair
then
she
sat
down
and
did
her
face
very
neatly
it
is
about
the
only
thing
she
does
really
well
she
put
red
on
her
lips
and
white
on
her
nose
and
black
on
her
eyes
till
she
looked
like
a
siamese
doll
i
once
had
before
i
licked
the
paint
off
i
paid
particular
attention
for
i
shall
do
it
when
i
am
that
is
if
i
am
able
to
afford
it
the
best
paints
and
i
am
told
that
stands
you
in
about
four
hundred
a
year
her
hair
is
the
very
newest
gold
shade
the
one
they
have
in
paris
rather
purplish
it
will
be
blue
next
season
i
dare
say
it
is
just
a
little
bit
dark
down
by
the
roots
which
is
pretty
i
think
and
looks
so
very
natural
all
the
time
miller
was
dressing
it
she
worked
away
at
the
front
with
the
stick
of
her
comb
pulling
little
bits
out
and
putting
them
back
and
staring
into
a
as
anxiously
as
if
her
life
depended
on
it
while
miller
patiently
gummed
some
little
tendrils
of
hair
down
on
her
forehead
child
child
she
said
to
me
do
you
know
what
makes
me
sigh
indigestion
i
asked
quite
on
the
chance
but
she
said
it
was
that
she
never
had
had
it
it
was
only
because
she
felt
so
terribly
so
diabolically
so
preternaturally
ugly
oh
no
you
look
sweet
i
said
i
really
thought
so
but
miller
grinned
you
are
delightful
lady
scilly
said
and
you
can
have
that
boa
you
are
fiddling
with
if
you
like
tulle
is
death
to
me
makes
me
meretricious
and
child
when
your
times
comes
do
ever
ever
have
anything
to
do
with
massage
it
grows
on
one
so
one
ca
leave
it
off
and
it
has
to
be
always
with
one
like
the
poor
i
have
actually
to
subsidize
a
masseuse
to
live
round
the
corner
and
she
cheeks
me
all
the
time
oh
i
know
about
massage
i
massed
ariadne
once
according
to
a
system
we
read
of
in
a
book
i
seldom
had
such
a
chance
at
her
i
pinched
her
black
and
blue
and
she
kept
saying
go
on
harder
harder
but
as
it
did
seem
to
agree
with
her
afterwards
i
did
do
it
again
but
i
took
the
boa
to
give
ariadne
i
have
no
use
for
such
things
myself
when
lady
scilly
was
ready
she
said
we
wo
lunch
in
we
will
go
to
prince
and
have
a
scilly
in
a
bad
temper
because
of
bills
well
bills
must
come
and
i
may
go
i
suppose
there
no
reason
one
should
keep
out
of
their
way
she
stuck
a
hat
on
with
twenty
feathers
in
it
and
we
went
down
and
she
told
the
butler
to
call
a
hansom
now
and
tell
the
carriage
to
fetch
us
at
three
the
butler
said
very
well
my
lady
your
ladyship
has
a
of
ten
all
in
the
same
voice
so
i
have
oh
parker
what
a
fool
i
am
and
she
flopped
into
a
hall
seat
yes
my
lady
parker
said
quite
politely
closing
the
again
he
has
known
her
from
a
child
so
he
may
be
rude
so
we
took
off
our
hats
at
least
i
did
she
wears
a
hat
every
time
she
can
except
in
bed
and
went
into
the
library
where
lord
scilly
was
and
her
cousin
a
young
man
from
the
foreign
office
simon
hermyre
that
i
know
lord
scilly
came
up
to
her
and
said
out
loud
you
have
got
too
much
on
she
softly
dabbed
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
to
please
him
but
so
as
not
to
disturb
anything
and
the
young
man
from
the
foreign
office
laughed
he
is
a
fifth
cousin
lady
scilly
says
her
cousins
grow
like
blackberries
on
every
bush
one
of
the
penalties
of
greatness
i
never
really
seen
your
face
paquerette
he
said
and
i
do
believe
it
would
justify
my
wildest
expectations
still
i
think
you
are
right
not
to
make
it
too
cheap
who
coming
smart
people
or
one
of
your
bohemian
crowds
you
see
she
said
ptomaine
for
one
dear
tommy
said
he
i
love
her
desist
o
wasp
he
said
to
one
that
had
come
in
by
the
window
and
was
bothering
him
this
is
a
precursor
of
tommy
tommy
all
right
so
long
as
she
has
got
her
knife
into
you
she
favours
you
simon
you
are
to
take
her
in
and
distract
her
and
see
that
she
does
make
eyes
at
my
tame
millionaire
oh
mr
pawky
said
simon
is
he
coming
you
should
put
me
opposite
so
that
i
could
intercept
the
glances
and
why
may
tommy
have
a
bit
of
him
she
terribly
thin
because
he
is
a
very
big
millionaire
only
half
a
one
and
only
just
enough
for
me
so
you
know
what
you
have
got
to
do
you
may
flirt
wildly
with
tommy
if
nothing
else
will
do
let
me
see
who
else
is
coming
oh
marston
the
actor
a
nice
boy
gives
me
boxes
and
mortally
afraid
of
lauderdale
and
some
odd
just
think
i
nearly
went
out
to
lunch
with
this
child
and
forgot
you
all
i
should
like
to
have
seen
all
your
faces
then
all
these
people
came
and
lady
scilly
put
me
on
one
side
of
the
millionaire
and
herself
on
the
other
he
looked
very
mild
and
indigestible
and
as
if
millionairing
did
agree
with
him
he
could
only
drink
hot
water
and
eat
dry
toast
he
made
a
little
conversation
with
me
but
he
attended
most
to
lady
scilly
of
course
she
was
telling
him
all
about
miss
lauderdale
and
and
the
dresses
and
discussing
society
as
it
is
now
titles
why
my
dear
man
no
one
cares
a
fig
for
birth
no
the
only
thing
we
care
for
is
culture
and
the
only
thing
we
forgive
is
for
people
to
bore
us
i
wondered
where
the
poor
millionaire
came
in
for
he
ca
culture
while
he
certainly
does
bore
but
i
suppose
lady
scilly
would
waste
her
time
for
nothing
and
perhaps
there
is
some
other
attraction
society
takes
count
of
that
she
did
mention
i
go
anywhere
and
everywhere
to
be
amused
she
went
on
i
go
to
gatti
music
hall
under
the
arches
only
music
halls
are
a
bit
stale
now
i
go
to
a
in
a
sewer
anything
to
get
some
colour
into
my
life
paint
the
town
red
would
you
muttered
lord
scilly
that
is
the
way
we
all
are
lady
scilly
went
on
look
at
kitty
london
she
is
going
to
marry
a
perfect
darling
of
an
acrobat
who
can
play
billiards
on
his
own
back
cheap
culture
that
said
lord
scilly
and
i
do
know
what
he
meant
but
i
knew
he
meant
to
be
nasty
but
the
millionaire
went
on
sipping
his
hot
water
and
enjoyed
having
a
countess
talk
like
that
to
him
and
stood
her
any
amount
of
dinners
at
the
paxton
for
it
i
dare
say
they
say
he
runs
it
he
was
well
protected
but
still
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
ptomaine
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
not
even
opposite
seemed
to
have
her
eye
on
him
one
of
them
at
any
rate
simon
could
manage
to
distract
both
i
did
like
her
she
came
to
our
ball
in
a
mask
and
flirted
with
frederick
cook
i
quite
saw
why
simon
hermyre
compared
her
to
a
wasp
she
looked
as
if
she
sat
up
too
late
and
drank
too
much
tea
and
i
was
sure
that
though
they
were
very
smart
her
petticoats
were
all
muddy
at
the
bottom
she
called
lady
scilly
darling
across
the
table
every
now
and
then
to
show
how
intimate
she
was
lady
scilly
never
cares
or
notices
it
is
one
of
her
charms
the
actor
was
on
her
other
side
i
saw
lord
scilly
stare
at
his
eighteen
rings
and
his
nice
painted
face
as
if
he
were
a
new
arrival
but
there
is
some
excuse
for
him
he
was
just
up
he
said
so
and
i
dare
say
he
was
too
tired
to
wash
the
paint
off
when
he
got
home
this
morning
besides
that
he
is
acting
juliet
to
miss
lauderdale
romeo
that
is
the
way
they
do
it
now
i
wish
i
had
seen
shakespeare
when
men
acted
men
parts
and
women
did
women
but
i
was
born
too
late
for
that
when
we
got
up
from
lunch
ptomaine
cleverly
caught
her
dress
in
a
leg
of
her
chair
and
she
would
let
the
actor
disengage
it
but
waited
till
the
millionaire
came
past
her
seat
and
had
a
feeble
try
at
it
she
smiled
at
him
very
gratefully
for
tearing
a
large
bit
of
the
flounce
off
in
getting
it
out
but
after
all
it
made
an
introduction
and
she
can
have
a
new
piece
of
common
lace
put
in
afterwards
in
the
she
had
quite
a
nice
chat
with
him
before
lady
scilly
sent
somebody
to
break
it
up
as
she
did
after
five
minutes
at
four
they
all
went
and
we
took
our
drive
after
all
lady
scilly
never
pays
calls
only
the
bourgeois
do
but
we
went
to
see
ptomaine
i
had
a
word
with
tommy
lady
scilly
said
and
i
had
several
little
things
to
arrange
with
her
i
ca
sleep
till
i
have
put
a
spoke
in
lauderdale
wheel
poor
tommy
what
a
fright
she
looked
but
she
is
not
a
bad
sort
is
tommy
and
devoted
to
me
what
does
she
do
i
asked
oh
she
works
the
press
for
me
she
has
command
of
papers
goodness
knows
how
for
i
am
sure
no
editor
would
ever
care
for
her
to
make
love
to
him
she
is
useful
you
see
she
describes
my
dresses
free
i
do
care
for
that
myself
naturally
but
the
dressmakers
do
if
their
names
are
given
and
then
they
do
worry
so
with
their
bills
and
she
interviewed
me
once
and
i
gave
kitty
london
such
a
lesson
things
i
wanted
conveyed
to
her
you
know
and
could
not
quite
say
myself
it
is
rather
a
good
idea
to
conduct
one
quarrels
through
the
press
is
it
here
we
are
at
tommy
flat
up
at
the
very
very
top
the
vulture
in
its
eyrie
is
it
the
vulture
that
has
an
eyrie
i
know
it
has
a
ragged
neck
with
cheap
fur
round
it
up
we
go
no
lift
one
ought
to
visit
with
flats
without
a
lift
you
ring
i
rang
and
ptomaine
herself
opened
the
door
so
soon
darling
delightful
she
said
she
did
look
very
pleased
to
see
us
i
thought
but
she
was
in
to
tea
i
could
see
for
there
were
three
kinds
of
little
and
a
yellow
cake
made
with
i
wanted
to
prime
you
about
your
critique
of
you
know
now
tommy
it
is
understood
lauderdale
is
to
be
snubbed
and
punished
for
her
impertinence
in
daring
to
act
in
dresses
darling
quite
so
of
course
i
had
it
nearly
written
dearest
you
do
trust
your
tommy
not
so
much
darling
dear
now
if
you
do
mind
said
lady
scilly
we
are
alone
and
this
child
does
need
impressing
it
fidgets
me
all
right
sweetheart
i
beg
your
pardon
said
ptomaine
quite
obligingly
but
talk
of
fidgeting
she
herself
was
in
a
terrible
state
is
it
too
early
for
tea
too
late
you
mean
tommy
what
is
the
matter
with
you
have
you
got
a
headache
three
distinct
headaches
said
poor
tommy
did
three
first
nights
last
night
and
got
a
separate
headache
for
each
how
interesting
said
lady
scilly
i
mean
i
am
very
sorry
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
no
no
nothing
i
have
experience
of
these
nothing
but
complete
rest
will
do
any
good
if
i
could
just
lie
down
and
darken
the
room
and
think
of
nothing
for
an
hour
lady
scilly
got
up
to
go
after
such
a
plain
hint
as
that
and
we
were
just
opening
the
door
when
it
opened
itself
and
let
in
the
millionaire
ptomaine
made
the
best
of
it
she
got
up
to
receive
him
with
a
very
pained
smile
on
the
side
of
her
face
next
lady
scilly
and
said
to
her
in
an
undertone
no
chance
for
me
you
see
this
man
will
want
his
tea
you
go
lady
scilly
had
even
said
she
must
go
but
she
did
go
and
as
my
brother
ben
says
what
was
more
she
said
ptomaine
in
a
tone
that
must
have
peeled
the
skin
off
poor
tommy
nose
no
more
dears
and
darlings
to
the
millionaire
she
said
so
we
meet
again
and
from
the
way
she
said
that
polite
thing
i
should
say
he
would
have
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
he
would
ever
be
invited
to
drink
in
her
house
any
more
there
are
as
good
millionaires
in
south
africa
as
ever
came
out
of
it
she
said
to
me
going
poor
old
pawky
one
woman
after
another
exploits
the
dear
old
thing
they
are
kind
to
him
le
bon
motif
he
did
say
to
me
in
a
first
introduction
you
any
bills
but
i
put
it
down
to
his
south
african
manners
and
his
idea
of
breaking
the
ice
and
making
conversation
tommy
will
fleece
him
i
hope
get
him
to
give
her
a
new
carpet
i
know
that
pawky
gave
lady
scilly
her
box
at
the
opera
but
then
it
was
on
consideration
of
her
allowing
him
to
sit
in
it
with
her
now
and
then
thus
she
gives
a
pro
which
poor
tommy
ca
do
having
nothing
marketable
about
her
not
even
a
title
if
he
values
lady
scilly
kindness
he
is
a
fool
to
run
after
tommy
so
obviously
but
that
is
what
i
have
noticed
about
these
rich
people
they
seem
to
lose
their
heads
let
themselves
go
cheap
every
now
and
then
tommy
is
so
ugly
she
never
looked
nice
in
her
life
except
when
she
was
sulphuretta
hydrogen
at
our
party
and
wore
a
mask
and
flirted
with
frederick
cook
that
he
must
be
demented
or
jealous
of
frederick
cook
perhaps
she
has
an
organ
i
mean
a
paper
she
on
and
i
suppose
she
can
write
pawky
up
still
i
think
he
has
made
a
bad
exchange
for
ptomaine
wo
last
they
change
the
staffs
of
those
papers
in
the
night
and
any
morning
frederick
cook
may
walk
down
to
the
office
and
find
a
new
man
sitting
at
his
desk
and
the
same
with
ptomaine
where
there
a
way
of
making
a
little
there
a
minx
to
take
it
so
she
often
says
lady
scilly
ca
lose
her
title
except
to
change
it
for
another
and
a
nicer
chapter
x
it
is
a
very
odd
thing
that
with
a
father
a
novelist
who
can
sell
ten
thousand
copies
of
a
book
you
ca
get
any
sort
of
useful
advice
on
the
subject
he
has
made
peculiarly
his
own
ariadne
would
much
sooner
consult
the
cook
about
such
things
and
it
is
not
nice
to
ask
advice
from
a
person
who
can
oblige
you
to
follow
it
george
ca
in
fairness
advise
as
an
author
and
command
as
a
father
so
the
result
is
that
ariadne
makes
blunders
at
all
these
parties
she
goes
to
now
poor
girl
she
only
has
me
to
consult
i
say
it
is
a
mistake
the
moment
you
enter
a
room
to
fix
your
eyes
on
the
man
you
want
to
dance
with
you
or
even
to
ask
him
for
a
dance
as
ariadne
did
once
she
said
she
thought
he
was
too
shy
to
ask
her
though
he
did
know
her
a
little
and
she
wanted
to
see
if
he
danced
as
beautifully
as
he
looked
a
man
shy
it
takes
a
shy
girl
like
ariadne
to
imagine
that
for
ariadne
is
both
shy
and
superstitious
she
gets
that
from
lady
scilly
and
lady
scilly
aunt
the
countess
of
plyndyn
a
very
fat
old
lady
with
a
corresponding
hand
that
when
she
holds
it
out
to
a
it
is
like
counting
the
creases
in
a
she
makes
them
take
count
of
every
crease
though
and
begs
them
to
invent
a
fate
for
her
have
i
got
a
future
like
other
people
she
whines
and
then
the
poor
paid
in
a
great
hurry
sows
a
crop
of
initials
in
her
hand
and
she
is
not
more
than
pleased
and
takes
it
as
a
right
to
have
three
husbands
although
she
is
already
seventy
lady
scilly
never
thinks
of
having
an
now
without
at
least
two
in
different
parts
of
the
house
you
see
people
waiting
in
little
lumps
at
the
doors
in
a
little
more
and
they
would
be
tying
their
handkerchiefs
to
the
handles
just
as
you
do
to
to
say
who
has
the
right
to
go
in
first
they
go
in
shyly
just
like
people
who
have
made
a
stumble
in
the
street
looking
silly
and
they
come
out
looking
humble
like
people
who
have
been
having
their
hair
washed
the
does
tell
women
the
very
serious
things
for
instance
that
they
are
going
to
die
themselves
though
she
tells
them
when
their
husbands
are
they
always
tell
ariadne
what
sort
of
coloured
man
she
is
going
to
marry
but
as
there
are
only
two
sorts
of
coloured
men
fair
and
dark
it
is
sure
to
come
right
sometimes
the
last
time
the
woman
said
fair
verging
on
red
and
as
ariadne
does
know
any
man
who
has
anything
like
red
hair
except
aix
whom
she
does
care
for
she
frowned
and
said
are
you
quite
sure
the
woman
changed
it
to
dark
almost
black
in
a
great
hurry
and
ariadne
was
pleased
for
it
is
a
safer
colour
ariadne
wears
a
piece
of
wood
let
into
a
bracelet
that
lady
scilly
gave
her
just
the
same
as
she
wears
herself
and
touches
it
whenever
she
thinks
misfortune
is
in
the
air
or
when
she
is
afraid
of
making
a
fool
of
herself
more
than
usual
she
took
me
out
to
gather
may
dew
in
kensington
gardens
and
very
smutty
it
was
she
always
counts
and
once
at
the
islingtons
lunch
when
it
came
badly
she
actually
swallowed
never
now
in
lady
scilly
set
they
call
her
the
girl
that
swallowed
never
and
it
seems
to
amuse
them
anything
amuses
them
especially
a
nickname
i
myself
wonder
ariadne
did
not
have
appendicitis
or
at
least
that
growing
out
of
her
ear
they
used
to
tell
us
of
when
we
were
children
at
luncheon
parties
now
they
make
a
joke
of
refusing
to
help
her
to
greengage
cherry
or
in
fact
to
anything
countable
and
ariadne
does
seem
to
see
that
it
is
plain
to
them
all
that
she
is
anxious
to
be
married
which
though
it
is
true
sounds
unpleasant
at
any
rate
for
the
men
she
is
wild
to
be
married
and
to
go
away
and
leave
this
house
and
have
a
house
of
her
own
that
she
can
ask
me
to
come
and
stay
at
and
miss
mander
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
wish
only
why
make
it
public
nor
she
need
let
every
one
know
that
george
only
gives
her
fifteen
pounds
a
year
to
dress
like
a
lady
on
it
is
cheaper
to
dress
like
an
artist
or
a
bohemian
or
in
character
and
so
she
does
we
do
have
any
dressmaker
we
hardly
know
the
feel
of
one
even
mother
and
ariadne
make
their
own
clothes
and
mother
never
going
out
is
able
to
give
ariadne
a
little
extra
off
her
own
allowance
i
do
know
how
much
that
is
she
will
never
tell
mother
has
all
the
taste
that
aunt
gerty
has
got
it
is
odd
how
taste
skips
one
in
a
family
aunt
gerty
is
like
a
very
smart
dressed
in
odds
and
ends
to
show
the
fashion
on
a
small
scale
and
fashion
after
all
is
only
a
matter
of
bulge
you
bulge
in
a
different
place
every
year
and
if
you
can
only
bulge
a
little
earlier
or
leave
off
bulging
in
any
particular
place
sooner
than
other
people
well
you
may
consider
you
are
a
woman
ariadne
makes
money
doing
his
reviews
for
george
he
gives
her
sixpence
a
head
when
he
remembers
to
dozens
of
books
come
in
to
our
house
every
week
from
and
for
george
is
pease
blossom
on
we
do
need
to
subscribe
to
a
library
we
live
in
a
practically
for
they
are
all
sold
in
booksellers
row
afterwards
george
takes
the
important
ones
of
course
and
gives
the
smaller
fry
to
ariadne
to
do
she
is
his
understudy
when
they
are
ready
george
writes
hers
up
and
christina
types
them
and
it
all
goes
in
together
he
once
reviewed
a
batch
of
bad
ones
under
the
heading
of
and
people
thought
him
clever
but
malicious
papa
does
know
it
but
ariadne
has
an
understudy
too
she
lets
the
novels
out
to
me
and
gives
me
twopence
a
head
i
must
say
that
she
has
no
idea
of
beating
one
down
i
read
them
as
carefully
as
i
have
time
for
it
depends
on
how
many
ariadne
gives
me
and
then
when
she
is
doing
her
hair
i
sit
beside
her
and
tell
her
the
plots
the
more
improper
ones
she
keeps
to
herself
but
i
read
those
for
pleasure
not
work
so
it
all
right
ariadne
knows
about
a
dozen
useful
phrases
that
she
did
invent
but
found
ready
made
up
to
the
level
of
this
author
reputation
is
one
marks
a
distinct
advance
breezy
strong
or
convincing
and
the
opposites
unconvincing
weak
morbid
effete
are
useful
ones
she
uses
all
these
turn
and
turn
about
and
always
mentions
a
fine
sense
of
atmosphere
if
she
honestly
can
she
has
great
fun
sometimes
when
she
meets
the
authors
in
society
she
flirts
with
them
till
they
get
confidential
and
tell
her
about
their
books
and
how
totally
they
have
been
misunderstood
by
the
press
and
what
a
crassly
ignorant
set
reviewers
are
they
explain
to
her
that
not
one
of
the
whole
d
d
crew
has
the
slightest
sense
of
responsibility
especially
the
which
has
got
the
most
staff
that
ever
paper
went
to
the
devil
with
ariadne
is
amused
at
all
this
and
gives
them
another
chance
of
conversation
and
then
they
go
on
to
quote
her
own
words
to
her
once
though
she
got
caught
and
george
very
nearly
took
all
the
reviewing
away
from
her
for
he
had
to
stand
the
racket
himself
of
course
she
had
actually
said
at
the
end
of
the
review
that
it
was
a
pity
i
forget
the
author
name
did
not
relieve
our
anxiety
as
to
the
perpetrator
of
the
hellish
crime
which
to
the
very
end
he
allowed
to
remain
shrouded
in
obscurity
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
a
hanging
scene
and
dying
confession
in
the
last
chapter
but
one
but
ariadne
unfortunately
burnt
that
before
she
had
got
to
it
she
was
using
the
novel
as
a
screen
to
keep
the
draught
off
the
flame
for
heating
her
tongs
and
so
she
never
read
that
part
and
had
to
make
up
her
own
end
the
editor
of
had
to
acknowledge
the
error
and
apologize
in
a
footnote
because
the
author
threatened
a
libel
action
ariadne
does
care
about
meeting
that
man
in
society
it
is
fairer
at
any
rate
for
ariadne
to
review
books
than
george
because
she
does
write
them
people
who
write
books
should
have
the
right
to
say
what
they
think
of
other
people
it
is
like
a
mother
listening
to
tales
in
the
nursery
and
putting
one
child
in
the
corner
to
please
another
i
once
went
into
the
study
and
saw
george
walking
up
and
down
and
throwing
light
bits
of
furniture
about
d
m
the
fellow
he
stolen
the
babe
unborn
of
an
excellent
plot
of
mine
and
mauled
it
and
ruined
it
beyond
recognition
it
was
no
use
my
putting
in
my
word
and
saying
well
then
george
you
can
use
it
again
he
went
on
fuming
and
fussing
loudly
dictating
a
regular
corker
of
a
review
i
let
him
have
it
go
on
please
miss
mander
signal
ineptitude
of
this
i
am
sure
that
was
going
to
be
a
very
unpleasant
review
to
read
though
i
never
saw
it
in
print
ariadne
is
sentimental
and
does
care
for
realistic
novels
at
all
which
is
a
pity
as
george
greatest
friend
and
the
person
who
comes
oftenest
to
this
house
is
a
realist
and
wrote
a
novel
called
he
lived
in
shoreditch
in
a
tenement
dwelling
for
a
whole
year
to
learn
how
to
write
it
from
the
laundresses
themselves
he
went
to
tea
with
a
different
laundress
every
afternoon
the
one
he
wrote
about
had
three
diamond
rings
and
three
husbands
to
match
he
himself
wore
flannel
shirts
then
not
nice
such
as
he
has
now
but
the
flannel
shirts
were
because
he
was
poor
but
so
as
not
to
frighten
the
laundresses
by
looking
too
smart
then
the
book
came
out
and
there
was
a
great
fuss
about
it
and
it
was
published
at
sixpence
and
our
cook
bought
it
and
it
lies
on
the
beside
the
that
is
the
reason
aix
being
a
realist
makes
more
money
than
papa
who
is
an
idealist
you
see
duchesses
and
countesses
want
to
hear
all
about
laundresses
just
as
much
as
cooks
do
but
though
duchesses
and
countesses
are
interested
in
mediæval
knights
and
maidens
cooks
nor
yet
laundresses
are
the
suburbs
do
not
appreciate
me
as
they
do
you
old
man
he
says
sometimes
if
i
was
proper
they
would
even
look
at
me
ay
the
suburbs
george
says
dreamily
the
kind
the
mild
the
tenderly
trustful
suburbs
i
manipulate
them
freely
i
have
taught
peckham
rye
and
clapham
that
there
are
stranger
things
in
pall
mall
and
piccadilly
than
are
dreamt
of
in
their
simple
philosophy
you
have
tickled
the
philistines
not
smitten
them
says
aix
i
have
shocked
them
they
love
being
shocked
i
have
startled
them
that
does
them
good
i
have
puzzled
them
not
altogether
unpleasantly
i
have
inured
them
to
dukes
and
familiarized
them
with
duchesses
as
the
butcher
hardens
his
pony
to
a
i
reduce
to
a
common
romantic
denominator
you
are
like
those
useful
earthworms
of
darwin
bringing
up
soil
and
interweaving
strata
said
aix
wearily
george
accepted
the
worm
reluctantly
and
went
on
yes
i
dominate
the
lower
strata
they
dote
on
any
gospel
i
chose
at
the
moment
to
formulate
for
their
crass
benefit
miss
mander
did
you
ever
envisage
peckham
i
lived
there
and
sold
matches
once
said
she
and
moreover
kept
a
home
for
distressed
in
the
isle
of
dogs
is
there
anything
you
have
done
said
aix
quite
jealous
of
a
woman
interfering
in
his
own
line
he
always
makes
a
point
of
living
among
his
raw
material
when
he
was
writing
in
order
to
get
the
serious
atmosphere
which
i
should
have
thought
gin
would
have
done
for
well
enough
he
went
every
night
of
his
life
to
some
music
hall
or
other
and
went
behind
and
talked
to
them
and
fastened
their
frocks
at
the
back
for
them
and
put
in
when
they
stuck
out
just
as
they
were
going
on
then
he
stood
them
drinks
and
did
preach
for
his
life
for
if
he
had
the
would
have
told
him
anything
or
shown
him
the
secret
of
their
inner
life
he
had
to
pretend
that
he
thought
them
and
their
life
all
that
was
perfect
christina
calls
this
novel
the
sweetmeat
in
the
gutter
and
loves
it
though
george
says
it
is
as
broad
as
it
long
and
that
ladies
should
read
it
but
christina
has
been
to
klondike
and
seen
the
seamy
side
so
it
does
matter
have
read
and
i
ca
see
anything
wrong
there
more
seriousness
than
fun
in
it
miss
deucie
dulcimer
real
name
is
frances
raggles
and
she
the
mother
of
five
in
the
course
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
pages
and
there
a
in
every
chapter
aix
is
forty
but
he
looks
like
a
boy
he
has
a
snub
soft
nose
like
lady
scilly
pug
with
wrinkles
on
the
bridge
of
it
he
wears
spectacles
because
of
his
weak
eyes
and
he
always
says
quite
so
as
if
he
were
enough
to
agree
with
providence
in
everything
he
is
the
opposite
of
george
who
is
proud
to
be
considered
perhaps
that
is
why
they
are
friends
if
aix
were
a
dog
he
would
knock
over
everything
with
his
tail
he
has
no
tact
he
never
drinks
anything
but
water
and
does
calisthenics
before
breakfast
with
an
exerciser
on
a
door
he
is
the
kind
of
man
who
would
put
stops
in
a
telegram
so
very
punctilious
his
eyes
are
wall
and
look
different
ways
and
aunt
gerty
says
that
once
at
a
dance
he
asked
two
girls
for
the
same
polka
and
they
both
accepted
because
he
looked
at
them
both
at
the
same
time
he
is
about
the
only
person
who
does
think
ariadne
pretty
so
ariadne
naturally
dislikes
him
she
ca
help
it
if
we
did
let
her
think
she
was
pretty
she
would
have
jaundice
or
something
lingering
of
that
sort
she
snubs
aix
but
somehow
he
wo
consider
himself
snubbed
it
comes
of
having
no
sense
of
decency
as
the
reviews
say
of
him
christina
chaffs
him
and
teases
him
about
his
next
novel
and
asks
him
if
it
is
to
be
called
or
and
what
the
is
to
be
the
scullery
or
the
just
outside
london
i
have
an
idea
that
it
will
be
called
for
he
has
lately
taken
to
coming
up
into
the
little
entresol
on
the
stairs
where
we
sit
and
stitch
and
make
our
frocks
and
asking
us
to
teach
him
to
sew
he
puts
out
a
hand
like
a
sheaf
of
bananas
ariadne
fits
a
needle
into
one
of
them
and
he
cobbles
away
quite
painstakingly
for
an
hour
once
he
came
up
when
ariadne
was
awfully
tired
and
could
hardly
keep
her
eyes
open
as
she
always
is
after
a
dance
i
have
often
wondered
he
began
what
must
be
the
sensations
of
a
young
girl
on
entering
on
her
kingdom
of
the
is
she
dazzled
is
she
obfuscated
by
the
twinkling
repetition
of
the
lights
are
her
senses
stunned
or
stimulated
by
the
ponderous
beat
of
the
time
relentless
under
its
of
melody
like
despair
underlying
frivolity
is
she
he
would
have
gone
on
for
ever
if
i
had
not
interrupted
i
can
tell
you
she
thinking
all
the
time
there
a
sticking
out
is
the
tip
of
my
nose
shiny
is
my
dress
too
short
in
front
and
is
it
properly
fastened
at
the
back
and
what
does
it
depends
which
mister
is
there
that
evening
think
of
it
all
do
tempe
said
ariadne
no
no
miss
tempe
go
on
i
beg
of
you
go
on
being
indiscreet
tell
me
some
more
things
about
women
do
you
know
why
women
always
sit
on
one
side
when
they
are
alone
in
a
hansom
no
i
have
no
idea
some
charmingly
morbid
reason
i
suppose
oh
you
can
call
it
morbid
if
you
like
i
said
it
is
only
because
there
happens
to
be
a
there
george
and
aix
have
different
publishers
but
the
same
literary
agent
a
publisher
once
took
them
both
to
the
top
of
a
high
hill
in
surrey
and
tempted
them
to
sell
him
the
rights
of
every
novel
they
did
for
ten
years
and
be
kept
in
luxury
by
him
but
they
both
shook
their
heads
and
said
you
must
go
to
middleman
then
he
took
them
to
a
london
restaurant
and
made
them
drunk
and
still
they
shook
their
heads
and
sent
him
to
middleman
who
makes
all
their
bargains
for
them
but
he
ca
control
all
the
reviews
one
morning
aix
came
in
to
see
george
with
a
blue
in
his
hand
i
was
in
the
study
then
as
it
happened
and
i
did
not
go
george
never
minds
our
hearing
everything
he
says
it
is
too
much
of
an
effort
to
be
a
hero
to
one
typewriter
or
one
daughter
i
am
in
a
rage
aix
said
and
so
i
suppose
he
was
though
he
looked
more
like
a
white
gooseberry
than
ever
just
let
me
get
hold
of
this
fellow
they
have
got
on
and
see
if
i
do
wring
his
neck
for
him
george
did
say
anything
and
so
i
asked
somebody
had
to
what
has
man
done
please
done
he
has
dammed
me
with
faint
praise
that
all
i
have
the
fellow
know
that
i
read
in
every
pothouse
every
kitchen
in
england
here
george
take
it
and
read
it
the
infamous
thing
george
read
it
at
least
he
ran
his
eyes
over
it
he
did
seem
to
want
to
see
it
particularly
and
gave
it
back
as
if
it
bit
him
saying
well
my
dear
fellow
you
must
take
the
rough
with
the
smooth
one
can
always
learn
something
from
criticism
or
so
i
find
what
the
devil
do
you
suppose
i
am
to
learn
from
an
incompetent
understrapper
like
that
he
wants
a
good
hiding
that
what
he
wants
and
i
for
one
would
have
no
objection
to
giving
it
him
well
it
was
me
wrote
it
aix
i
said
nor
ariadne
he
supposed
to
know
that
george
farms
out
his
reviews
aix
laughed
and
left
off
being
cross
the
odd
thing
was
that
it
had
only
just
missed
being
ariadne
or
me
for
the
book
certainly
came
in
for
review
most
likely
george
wrote
it
or
else
why
did
he
trouble
to
read
it
when
it
was
given
him
to
read
it
looks
as
if
he
were
growing
a
little
tiny
bit
of
a
conscience
for
he
knows
he
ought
to
have
said
to
editor
avaunt
do
tempt
an
author
to
review
his
friend
book
when
he
knows
he
can
not
speak
well
of
it
for
so
many
reasons
that
is
my
idea
of
literary
morality
chapter
xi
george
came
back
from
his
yachting
tour
with
the
scillys
very
brown
and
cheerful
having
collected
enough
sunshine
for
a
new
book
and
christina
is
typing
it
at
his
dictation
george
is
a
cranky
dictator
and
it
takes
her
all
her
time
to
keep
in
touch
with
him
i
have
watched
her
at
it
sometimes
he
stops
and
for
the
life
of
him
find
the
right
word
and
i
can
tell
by
her
eyes
that
she
knows
it
and
is
too
polite
to
give
it
him
just
the
way
one
longs
to
help
out
a
stutterer
but
i
have
seen
her
put
the
word
down
out
of
her
own
head
long
before
george
has
shouted
it
at
her
as
he
does
in
the
end
she
picks
and
chooses
too
a
little
for
george
is
a
tidy
swearer
as
the
cabman
said
i
suppose
he
learned
it
in
the
high
society
he
goes
among
he
does
it
all
the
time
he
is
composing
it
relieves
the
tension
he
says
and
she
does
mind
she
manages
him
george
pretends
he
knows
he
is
being
managed
which
shows
that
he
does
really
think
he
is
i
asked
her
once
why
she
did
marry
but
she
said
the
profession
of
typewriting
was
not
so
binding
as
the
other
for
you
could
get
down
off
your
high
stool
if
you
wanted
christina
always
says
rude
things
about
epigrams
and
marriage
she
is
not
very
old
only
thirty
but
she
says
she
has
outgrown
them
both
of
course
in
this
house
epigrams
are
the
same
as
hers
and
ours
for
george
pays
her
a
good
salary
for
typing
those
that
he
makes
ready
for
print
as
for
epigrams
she
says
she
can
make
them
herself
and
here
are
some
i
found
written
out
in
her
handwriting
on
a
china
memorandum
tablet
i
expect
she
keeps
a
separate
tablet
for
her
remarks
on
marriage
man
can
not
live
by
epigram
alone
epigrams
are
like
the
they
fling
out
of
the
boxes
at
a
at
the
opera
they
flat
fall
immediately
afterwards
an
epigram
is
like
the
deadly
upas
tree
and
blights
everything
in
the
shape
of
conversation
that
grows
near
it
reverse
an
epigram
and
you
get
a
platitude
the
savage
sour
and
friendless
epigram
the
last
sounds
to
me
all
wrong
for
it
has
no
verb
but
i
give
it
as
i
find
it
george
new
novel
is
to
be
called
senior
and
the
scene
is
laid
in
the
smart
sea
islands
our
blend
said
aix
of
opaline
sea
and
crystal
epigram
knocks
the
public
every
time
but
mark
me
christina
dear
this
sunlight
soap
wo
wash
clothes
it
is
for
home
consumption
it
gladdens
publishers
offices
but
leaves
the
domestic
hearth
cold
the
fires
of
passion
do
talk
to
me
of
passion
said
christina
i
just
detest
the
word
passion
is
piggish
it
a
perfect
disgrace
to
have
primitive
instincts
and
i
would
be
seen
dead
with
a
temperament
in
these
days
she
was
putting
a
new
ribbon
into
her
typewriter
and
trying
it
she
typed
something
like
this
christina
x
x
x
ball
x
x
x
x
ball
b
b
who
is
ball
said
aix
anxiously
christina
answered
as
if
she
meant
to
bite
his
head
off
a
man
who
never
made
an
epigram
in
his
life
and
stands
six
foot
six
in
his
shoes
the
noble
savage
eh
well
well
i
wish
him
luck
i
knew
who
ball
was
it
is
peter
ball
and
christina
likes
him
she
has
said
or
typed
anything
against
marriage
since
she
knew
him
it
was
at
a
concert
that
some
friends
of
hers
gave
in
queen
gate
that
she
first
met
him
i
was
with
her
and
we
all
sat
in
rows
on
rout
seats
that
skidded
and
flew
off
like
across
the
room
whenever
you
got
up
suddenly
peter
ball
sat
next
us
and
his
legs
were
long
though
his
feet
were
small
he
had
a
golden
beard
which
i
hate
and
so
i
thought
did
christina
she
had
always
said
there
was
one
thing
she
would
not
marry
and
that
was
a
beard
he
wished
out
loud
that
he
had
got
let
in
for
the
seats
so
that
he
could
not
make
a
clean
bolt
of
it
when
he
had
had
enough
of
miss
squallini
there
was
not
any
miss
of
that
name
on
the
programme
so
though
he
said
loud
no
one
could
be
offended
a
maddle
xeres
told
us
quite
slyly
lifting
her
eyebrows
up
and
down
that
she
knew
a
bank
as
if
she
had
got
up
early
like
the
worm
and
found
it
all
by
herself
after
that
one
of
the
spare
hostesses
came
wandering
by
and
introduced
him
to
us
he
began
to
talk
to
christina
without
looking
at
her
and
gradually
he
forgot
his
legs
and
put
one
under
the
rout
seat
in
front
of
him
and
lifted
it
up
without
thinking
the
lady
on
it
looked
round
indignantly
and
christina
smiled
after
that
he
talked
to
us
all
through
the
programme
though
people
shoo
him
and
then
he
stopped
for
a
little
and
apologized
and
went
on
again
i
do
often
turn
up
at
this
sort
of
function
do
you
he
asked
christina
no
i
do
not
she
replied
i
have
too
much
to
do
as
a
general
thing
and
stay
at
home
and
do
it
said
he
you
wise
i
have
to
said
christina
oh
she
sighed
i
am
so
dreadfully
hot
it
was
june
why
do
you
wear
that
bag
he
said
meaning
her
motor
tulle
veil
which
was
absurdly
thick
and
made
her
look
as
if
she
had
but
every
one
else
apparently
had
a
different
form
of
the
same
disease
shown
by
a
different
size
in
spots
she
said
so
and
that
she
wore
a
veil
like
every
one
else
get
out
of
it
ca
you
and
let
me
take
care
of
it
for
you
and
that
boa
thing
you
have
got
round
your
neck
she
took
it
off
and
the
boa
and
gave
them
to
him
i
am
afraid
you
will
drop
the
boa
and
let
the
veil
work
under
the
seat
she
said
in
a
fright
as
he
nipped
them
both
in
one
great
hand
so
he
pinned
them
boa
veil
and
all
to
his
grey
speckled
trousers
with
her
and
sat
all
through
the
rest
of
the
concert
looking
at
the
bunch
at
his
knee
i
never
saw
a
man
like
that
before
he
seem
at
all
like
the
people
who
come
to
cinque
cento
house
i
seem
to
see
him
there
and
i
rather
thought
i
should
like
to
why
he
would
make
george
straighten
his
back
i
say
he
said
presently
do
you
like
gramophones
i
love
them
said
christina
and
i
knew
it
was
a
lie
my
people
have
a
perfectly
splendid
one
said
he
and
his
whole
face
lighted
up
i
wish
you
could
hear
it
christina
wished
she
could
and
he
said
oh
then
we
will
manage
it
somehow
when
the
concert
was
over
he
did
bolt
as
he
had
said
he
wanted
to
but
gave
us
ices
christina
one
me
two
and
then
christina
put
the
bag
on
again
if
you
were
in
my
motor
in
that
thing
in
a
shower
you
get
drowned
said
he
why
it
would
the
water
i
should
like
to
drive
you
in
my
motor
all
the
same
i
say
ca
i
call
on
you
christina
told
him
very
nicely
that
she
was
private
secretary
to
the
author
george
and
had
much
time
for
herself
she
seemed
to
say
that
this
made
a
call
impossible
ah
i
see
live
in
do
you
well
i
call
there
drop
my
pasteboard
all
straight
and
formal
you
know
and
then
there
can
be
no
objection
to
my
giving
you
a
spin
in
the
motor
right
you
are
sinky
cento
house
what
a
rum
name
suggests
drains
never
mind
i
be
there
and
then
when
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
your
chaperon
she
allow
you
to
come
to
tea
with
my
mater
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
gramophone
my
mater
too
old
to
go
out
it
a
ripper
the
gramophone
i
mean
like
some
other
people
i
am
thinking
of
what
a
breezy
man
said
christina
on
the
way
home
he
reminds
me
of
the
northman
i
used
to
draw
at
south
kensington
i
broke
him
and
had
to
pay
for
him
then
she
began
to
think
i
believe
it
was
about
peter
ball
he
handsome
for
he
had
blue
eyes
and
a
little
short
straight
nose
like
the
sovereigns
in
madame
tussaud
is
he
exactly
like
harold
of
england
i
said
to
christina
i
hope
george
wo
snub
him
when
he
comes
to
see
you
he
wo
come
said
she
but
if
he
did
he
would
know
he
was
being
snubbed
no
he
would
say
to
george
your
snubs
for
a
man
of
your
own
size
but
christina
dear
i
always
you
hated
both
marriage
and
gramophones
i
am
not
so
sure
about
gramophones
said
she
perhaps
a
very
big
one
a
like
peter
ball
eh
she
was
quite
moody
and
absent
in
the
going
home
and
would
go
on
top
to
please
me
then
i
accidentally
stuck
my
umbrella
in
over
the
top
of
her
shoe
as
i
walked
beside
her
and
then
she
was
too
cross
to
speak
at
all
i
respected
her
mood
that
is
why
i
am
beloved
in
the
home
circle
but
i
have
my
own
ideas
and
they
keep
me
amused
i
was
unfortunately
out
of
the
way
when
peter
ball
did
call
three
days
later
mother
and
christina
were
in
and
ariadne
who
gave
me
a
true
account
of
it
all
she
says
the
first
thing
he
said
to
christina
was
i
hope
you
do
think
i
have
been
too
precipitate
i
suppose
he
meant
in
calling
he
stared
about
him
a
good
deal
at
first
and
she
thought
that
george
queer
furniture
made
him
feel
shy
and
that
he
thought
the
ivory
figure
of
buddha
quite
indecent
she
was
sure
he
did
admire
her
ariadne
but
only
christina
because
christina
is
a
girl
that
men
like
mother
made
the
tea
very
strong
that
afternoon
so
as
to
make
him
feel
at
home
and
then
after
all
he
touch
tea
she
kindly
offered
him
a
and
he
declined
that
but
i
expect
it
was
only
because
it
would
have
seemed
disrespectful
to
christina
all
men
are
alike
and
prone
to
a
and
if
they
can
get
it
without
disgrace
mother
was
sure
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
christina
and
she
with
him
at
the
very
first
sight
she
told
me
so
and
said
she
meant
to
help
it
on
it
is
because
christina
is
so
used
to
seeing
george
every
day
said
i
peter
ball
is
very
different
is
he
mother
said
that
there
was
no
accounting
for
tastes
and
that
for
her
part
she
considered
george
type
was
the
nicest
but
whatever
we
did
she
said
we
were
not
to
chaff
christina
about
it
and
put
her
off
a
very
good
match
a
girl
of
christina
sort
never
took
kindly
to
chaff
and
though
she
should
be
sorry
to
lose
christina
as
a
secretary
to
george
it
being
impossible
to
tell
what
sort
of
minx
he
might
engage
in
her
place
she
for
one
would
like
any
personal
consideration
whatever
to
interfere
with
christina
establishment
in
life
peter
ball
is
a
landed
gentry
he
is
in
the
county
of
northumberland
to
the
rattenraw
hunt
and
a
capital
shot
and
angler
when
his
old
mother
dies
he
will
be
richer
but
he
is
a
good
son
and
often
stays
with
her
in
leinster
gardens
where
he
has
asked
me
and
christina
to
go
to
tea
next
week
i
promised
not
to
chaff
but
if
she
had
only
known
it
would
have
taken
a
to
put
christina
off
that
particular
thing
she
talked
lots
about
peter
he
was
the
finest
specimen
of
humanity
she
had
ever
come
across
such
a
contrast
to
the
little
anæmic
effete
ambisextrous
i
hope
i
have
got
it
right
creatures
that
haunt
cinque
cento
house
who
are
all
trying
to
get
more
out
of
their
heads
than
is
in
them
greek
in
his
simplicity
a
sort
of
mixture
of
john
bull
and
antinöus
i
say
just
wait
till
you
see
his
mother
nice
men
mothers
are
sometimes
sad
and
peter
ball
is
always
talking
about
his
also
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
she
may
not
like
christina
and
then
i
am
sure
he
will
never
propose
to
her
he
is
an
admirable
son
i
believe
he
keeps
a
gramophone
just
to
attract
the
girls
he
admires
into
his
mother
cave
and
give
her
the
opportunity
of
looking
over
them
and
making
up
her
mind
if
they
are
fit
to
be
her
peter
wife
or
no
when
the
eventful
day
came
christina
was
on
thorns
she
did
know
how
to
dress
she
finally
left
off
the
chiffon
bag
and
wore
a
and
her
and
took
out
her
lest
they
should
damn
her
in
his
mother
eyes
then
at
exactly
five
minutes
to
four
we
rang
the
bell
in
leinster
square
a
proud
butler
opened
the
door
george
will
only
let
us
have
maids
although
he
could
afford
ten
butlers
the
house
was
beautiful
and
not
a
bit
like
ours
early
victorian
christina
whispered
me
she
was
dreadfully
nervous
and
made
me
too
i
dropped
my
umbrella
in
the
rack
with
such
a
clatter
that
she
blushed
and
scolded
me
then
a
tickled
my
head
as
i
went
by
and
i
begged
its
pardon
thinking
some
one
behind
was
trying
to
attract
my
attention
we
were
taken
into
a
big
room
with
pedestal
things
in
gold
and
stucco
set
down
at
intervals
and
a
clock
with
a
bare
pendulum
which
looks
simply
undressed
to
me
and
a
bronze
father
time
with
his
sickle
lying
lazily
across
the
top
on
another
clock
there
was
a
gilt
man
in
a
gilt
cart
whipping
up
two
gilt
horses
the
carpet
had
large
bouquets
of
roses
on
it
and
i
thought
what
a
good
game
it
would
be
to
pretend
they
were
islands
and
hop
across
from
one
to
the
other
i
began
but
she
stopped
me
in
a
corner
was
the
gramophone
like
a
great
brass
ear
put
out
to
hear
what
you
were
saying
it
was
playing
when
we
went
in
like
an
old
man
with
a
wheeze
and
in
came
peter
ball
looking
as
if
he
had
just
got
out
of
a
bath
and
said
it
is
playing
then
it
played
valse
bleue
and
casey
at
the
wake
and
casey
as
doctor
and
when
other
lips
and
then
peter
ball
said
his
mother
was
ready
into
another
room
we
went
full
of
berlin
chairs
and
screens
of
potiphar
and
his
wife
and
the
curtains
were
of
green
rep
with
ropes
of
silk
to
tie
them
back
and
gilt
festoons
to
hide
their
beginnings
and
an
old
old
lady
in
a
big
and
a
lace
cap
with
nodding
bugles
was
in
a
corner
just
like
another
and
older
bit
of
furniture
we
were
introduced
she
was
very
deaf
and
very
blind
and
i
am
not
sure
she
did
think
i
was
the
girl
peter
wanted
to
marry
however
that
might
be
she
seemed
pleased
with
us
and
we
talked
of
her
son
and
the
house
christina
who
used
to
say
she
preferred
a
chéret
poster
to
a
titian
and
plain
deal
to
mahogany
admired
everything
freely
the
rosewood
wheelbarrow
with
silver
fittings
given
to
peter
ball
father
when
he
laid
a
first
stone
somewhere
she
said
was
superb
and
so
graceful
the
picture
of
old
ball
by
ingres
in
a
poke
bonnet
and
short
waist
she
said
was
far
superior
to
anything
by
burne
jones
who
is
burne
jones
said
the
old
lady
and
christina
denied
burne
jones
cheerfully
i
thought
of
my
favourite
piece
of
poetry
see
ye
ladies
that
are
coy
what
the
mighty
love
can
do
then
we
had
tea
the
cake
in
a
silver
basket
on
a
fringed
mat
if
you
please
and
after
we
had
talked
a
little
more
we
said
and
peter
took
us
out
he
had
rushed
out
of
the
room
just
five
minutes
before
when
the
first
symptoms
of
manifested
themselves
and
we
saw
why
when
we
passed
out
through
the
first
room
where
the
gramophone
was
it
played
us
out
with
the
wedding
march
surely
a
graceful
thought
of
peter
ball
he
very
nice
but
what
a
pity
he
has
got
taste
i
said
as
we
came
away
you
see
i
am
used
to
cinque
cento
house
and
i
have
always
been
told
that
there
is
only
one
taste
and
that
ours
is
it
taste
christina
mooned
as
we
got
into
a
there
so
much
of
it
about
is
there
on
my
word
it
will
soon
be
quite
to
be
vulgar
it
was
not
difficult
to
tell
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
after
that
it
was
about
this
time
that
aix
found
christina
typing
her
own
name
and
peter
on
a
sheet
of
iii
imperial
he
had
even
set
eyes
on
peter
ball
then
but
he
did
a
few
days
later
when
peter
ball
came
to
tea
holding
his
grey
kid
gloves
in
his
hand
george
luckily
was
out
again
really
out
not
pretending
to
be
in
his
study
and
aix
it
was
who
opened
the
for
peter
when
he
went
away
at
seven
a
man
he
said
when
he
came
back
to
us
all
in
the
winter
garden
and
christina
was
just
going
out
escaping
to
her
own
room
to
think
over
peter
ball
i
dare
say
and
she
said
as
she
passed
him
i
could
hug
you
for
saying
that
mr
aix
no
you
could
said
he
i
am
popularly
supposed
to
be
repellent
a
lady
said
i
was
like
a
white
stick
of
celery
grown
in
a
dark
cellar
another
of
celebrity
compared
me
to
a
blasted
i
do
not
look
for
success
with
your
sex
it
was
kind
of
you
to
think
of
it
though
peter
ball
meant
business
or
else
we
could
not
have
all
spoken
of
it
so
openly
george
was
awfully
cross
at
the
idea
of
having
to
find
a
new
secretary
lady
scilly
said
she
thought
he
could
do
better
than
christina
who
was
too
forward
and
too
pretty
she
tried
very
hard
to
flirt
with
peter
herself
but
perhaps
peter
thought
could
do
better
and
would
she
looked
into
his
face
and
said
you
great
big
beauty
she
told
him
high
stories
as
christina
and
i
call
them
and
he
would
laugh
she
asked
him
right
out
why
he
would
and
he
answered
equally
right
out
because
i
disapprove
of
all
jesting
with
regard
to
the
relations
of
the
sexes
lady
scilly
looked
disgusted
and
left
him
severely
alone
as
he
meant
her
to
for
weeks
after
this
he
was
like
a
full
pail
of
water
one
is
afraid
to
carry
without
spilling
at
last
he
slopped
over
and
asked
christina
to
be
his
wife
i
was
in
the
room
of
course
but
christina
was
nice
and
told
us
afterwards
he
went
on
his
knees
she
says
and
i
believe
her
because
i
found
a
cushion
on
the
floor
immediately
after
before
the
housemaid
had
tidied
the
room
and
i
think
he
had
managed
to
put
it
under
his
knees
without
her
seeing
our
floor
is
bony
the
very
moment
she
said
he
had
got
me
to
say
yes
he
jumped
up
and
rushed
out
without
his
hat
to
send
a
telegram
to
his
mother
with
the
good
news
she
thought
this
so
nice
of
him
and
so
flattering
as
showing
that
he
had
made
quite
sure
of
her
for
though
we
all
knew
she
meant
to
take
him
he
was
not
supposed
to
be
aware
of
it
considering
that
christina
is
grown
up
she
ought
to
be
able
to
make
a
man
think
exactly
what
she
wishes
him
to
think
about
her
such
power
comes
or
should
come
with
advancing
years
and
is
one
of
its
compensations
ariadne
of
course
is
old
enough
to
have
left
off
being
quite
transparent
and
regrets
it
deeply
in
some
of
her
poetry
christina
was
married
to
peter
ball
almost
directly
and
ariadne
and
i
were
her
bridesmaids
mander
gave
us
our
dresses
and
hats
they
were
quite
fashionable
she
would
have
no
nonsense
or
necklaces
ariadne
looked
smart
and
like
other
people
for
once
she
did
look
so
pretty
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
want
to
go
about
the
streets
looking
like
a
picture
prettiness
is
everything
and
the
really
smartest
people
would
disdain
to
look
simply
ready
for
an
artist
to
paint
them
simon
hermyre
lady
scilly
best
friend
was
peter
ball
best
man
he
had
met
ariadne
at
the
scillys
but
at
christina
wedding
he
said
that
he
should
not
have
known
her
again
he
began
to
take
some
notice
of
her
she
at
once
asked
him
to
call
and
it
was
a
great
mistake
for
he
never
did
it
is
awkward
for
ariadne
i
admit
for
mother
not
going
out
and
george
being
perfectly
useless
as
a
father
she
has
to
do
all
her
own
asking
that
ca
be
helped
but
ariadne
is
always
hasty
and
strikes
while
the
iron
is
too
hot
simon
hermyre
did
like
her
but
he
quite
sure
that
he
actually
wanted
to
take
her
on
and
all
that
that
means
and
whether
he
liked
her
enough
to
risk
making
lady
scilly
angry
about
it
as
of
course
she
would
be
at
all
events
he
did
come
his
chief
kept
him
in
till
six
every
day
or
some
excuse
of
that
sort
as
if
a
man
could
always
manage
a
call
if
he
wanted
to
even
if
he
were
third
secretary
to
some
one
in
the
planet
mars
chapter
xii
we
never
used
to
go
away
for
more
than
a
week
every
summer
to
brighton
or
herne
bay
but
now
that
we
live
in
the
heart
of
the
town
as
of
course
john
wood
is
it
has
been
decided
that
we
want
a
whole
month
at
the
sea
this
year
mother
and
aunt
gerty
chose
whitby
in
yorkshire
it
is
convenient
for
aunt
gerty
something
about
a
company
that
she
is
thinking
of
joining
in
the
autumn
george
did
care
where
we
went
as
he
is
to
be
with
us
he
just
forks
out
the
money
as
mother
asks
for
it
he
trusts
her
implicitly
not
to
waste
it
and
to
do
things
as
cheap
as
they
can
be
done
and
yet
decently
because
after
all
we
his
family
and
everybody
knows
that
now
i
sometimes
think
he
would
come
with
us
himself
if
aunt
gerty
was
so
much
about
ariadne
and
aunt
gerty
have
got
an
ounce
of
country
fibre
in
them
they
get
at
loggerheads
with
the
country
at
once
the
mildest
cows
chase
them
they
manage
to
nearly
drown
themselves
in
the
tiniest
ditches
the
quietest
old
pony
rears
if
they
drive
him
if
they
pick
a
mushroom
it
is
sure
to
be
a
toadstool
if
they
bite
into
a
pear
there
a
wasp
inside
it
if
they
take
hold
of
a
village
baby
they
are
sure
to
drop
it
they
have
country
good
manners
they
leave
gates
open
they
trample
down
grass
they
entice
dogs
away
they
startle
geese
and
set
hens
running
and
offend
everybody
all
round
so
they
were
particularly
happy
in
the
first
rooms
we
took
at
a
farm
just
out
of
whitby
there
was
one
stuffy
little
best
parlour
sealed
up
like
a
bottle
of
medecine
and
one
mouldy
geranium
looking
as
if
it
could
help
it
on
the
and
the
seven
deadly
sins
in
chromo
on
the
walls
and
rebecca
at
a
well
of
berlin
wools
over
the
mantelpiece
they
covered
the
family
bible
with
an
antimacassar
and
aunt
gerty
theatrical
photos
without
which
she
never
travels
and
suppressed
the
frosty
ornament
in
a
glass
case
of
one
of
wilson
married
early
she
says
and
i
say
she
married
often
for
there
are
three
of
them
it
uncomfortable
mother
did
complain
aunt
gerty
did
she
had
nowhere
to
hang
up
her
dresses
they
were
all
getting
spoilt
she
could
see
to
do
her
hair
in
the
wretched
little
scrap
of
and
the
room
was
so
small
that
she
twice
set
fire
to
her
curling
her
hair
which
she
did
twenty
times
a
day
for
there
was
always
wind
or
rain
or
something
the
walls
were
so
thin
that
she
could
hear
every
word
and
wilson
said
to
each
other
in
the
next
room
quarrelling
and
arranging
the
bill
and
so
on
she
could
sleep
with
the
window
shut
and
all
sorts
of
horrid
buggy
things
came
in
if
you
left
it
open
it
was
so
dreadfully
lonely
here
and
she
had
never
seen
so
much
land
in
her
life
aunt
gerty
has
been
on
tour
often
enough
to
get
used
to
uncomfortable
lodgings
lodgings
not
chosen
by
herself
very
likely
and
her
luggage
all
fetched
away
the
day
before
she
leaves
by
the
baggage
man
but
it
is
in
a
town
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
give
her
a
strip
of
mirror
in
the
door
of
her
wardrobe
and
a
ready
to
set
fire
to
her
and
a
row
of
shops
outside
to
cheer
her
up
and
she
wo
think
of
grumbling
the
landlady
did
consider
us
a
particularly
good
let
i
used
to
hear
her
in
bed
in
the
mornings
explaining
to
wilson
who
is
a
railway
porter
how
glad
she
would
be
to
be
shot
of
us
if
it
for
the
money
ay
lass
he
would
answer
and
then
i
used
to
hear
him
turning
over
in
bed
and
going
to
sleep
again
they
better
to
keep
a
week
than
a
fortnight
she
used
to
say
what
with
their
late
dinners
and
breakfasts
in
bed
and
their
black
coffee
and
all
sitting
down
for
an
hour
o
mornings
polishing
up
them
ondacent
brown
boots
they
darse
trust
the
help
no
not
since
she
went
and
rubbed
them
with
lard
poor
girl
she
meant
well
and
she
fit
to
rive
her
legs
off
answering
the
parlour
bell
every
minute
well
the
sooner
i
see
their
backs
the
better
pleased
i
shall
be
we
took
the
hint
and
gave
up
the
rooms
and
got
some
nicer
ones
in
town
on
the
quay
aunt
gerty
left
off
bothering
mother
to
have
late
dinner
and
strong
coffee
and
we
lived
on
herrings
and
cream
cheeses
the
cheapest
things
in
whitby
i
mean
the
herrings
when
they
have
a
good
catch
they
sell
them
at
a
halfpenny
each
on
the
or
slap
their
children
with
them
or
shy
them
at
strangers
anything
to
keep
the
market
up
bennison
our
new
landlady
is
a
whitby
woman
but
her
husband
is
and
owns
a
boat
and
takes
ben
out
sailing
and
tries
to
make
a
man
of
him
we
hardly
ever
see
him
so
we
know
he
is
happy
mother
and
aunt
gerty
sit
one
on
each
side
of
the
bow
window
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
make
blouses
and
read
at
the
same
time
george
would
throw
their
books
into
the
harbour
if
he
caught
them
in
their
hands
they
are
the
sort
he
disapproves
of
i
wo
say
who
the
authors
of
these
are
as
being
a
literary
man
daughter
it
might
give
offence
but
they
are
by
women
mostly
george
vetoes
women
books
too
for
they
are
generally
bad
and
if
they
are
good
they
have
no
business
to
be
just
now
george
is
here
to
object
he
is
at
homburg
doing
a
cure
he
always
gets
brain
fag
towards
the
end
of
the
season
like
his
other
friends
it
seems
to
me
the
smartest
illness
to
have
except
appendicitis
the
moment
goodwood
is
over
they
all
troop
off
to
germany
or
switzerland
and
pay
pounds
to
some
doctor
who
only
makes
them
leave
off
eating
and
drinking
too
much
and
go
to
bed
a
little
before
daylight
it
is
kill
and
then
cure
with
the
smart
set
every
year
george
does
what
is
right
and
usual
bathes
in
champagne
at
wiesbaden
and
drinks
the
water
rotten
eggs
have
been
boiled
in
at
homburg
he
does
it
in
good
company
to
take
the
taste
away
aix
drew
us
a
picture
of
george
and
a
duchess
walking
up
and
down
a
parade
with
a
glass
tube
connected
with
a
tumbler
in
their
mouths
talking
about
emulating
the
life
of
the
busy
bee
as
they
went
along
about
the
middle
of
august
we
heard
he
had
come
back
to
england
and
was
paying
his
usual
round
of
visits
to
barefront
and
baddeley
and
fylingdales
tower
nearly
all
these
places
have
real
battlements
and
ghosts
fylingdales
tower
is
near
here
mother
and
i
and
aunt
gerty
joined
a
cheap
trip
to
it
the
other
day
and
were
taken
all
over
the
house
for
a
shilling
i
do
even
believe
the
family
was
away
but
stowed
away
and
staring
at
us
through
some
chink
and
loathing
us
i
did
manage
to
persuade
aunt
gerty
not
to
throw
away
her
sandwich
paper
in
the
grate
of
the
of
the
room
where
edward
the
third
had
slept
on
his
way
to
alnwick
but
kindly
keep
it
till
we
were
got
into
the
park
but
she
was
very
irreverent
all
the
same
and
insisted
on
setting
her
hat
straight
in
the
glass
of
queen
elizabeth
portrait
and
that
was
the
only
picture
she
looked
at
at
all
i
do
care
for
pictures
much
i
like
the
house
which
is
old
and
grey
and
bleached
as
if
it
never
got
a
good
night
sleep
too
many
spirits
to
break
its
rest
i
do
believe
in
ghosts
really
but
i
often
wonder
what
are
the
white
things
one
sees
i
do
see
so
many
as
i
did
when
i
was
quite
a
child
aunt
gerty
shivered
and
went
brr
she
hated
it
all
she
is
so
very
modern
she
admitted
that
she
only
went
with
us
because
she
had
hoped
george
might
be
actually
staying
there
and
would
see
his
own
among
the
trippers
and
get
a
nasty
jar
mother
is
a
lady
and
knew
quite
well
that
he
was
there
or
else
she
would
not
have
let
aunt
gerty
go
or
gone
herself
even
george
been
there
recently
though
for
the
housekeeper
said
so
and
that
she
read
his
books
herself
when
she
had
time
or
a
headache
he
quite
a
pet
of
her
ladyship
she
told
aunt
gerty
who
had
spotted
one
of
george
books
on
a
table
and
asked
questions
she
was
dying
to
tell
the
old
thing
that
we
were
relations
of
the
great
but
durs
for
mother
eye
was
on
her
mother
looked
as
pleased
as
punch
though
and
gazed
at
the
chairs
behind
plush
railings
that
her
husband
had
sat
on
and
at
the
portrait
in
greek
dress
by
sir
alma
tadema
of
the
lady
who
made
a
pet
of
him
george
had
written
from
homburg
once
or
twice
to
me
and
i
used
to
read
his
letters
out
to
mother
who
naturally
wanted
to
hear
his
news
she
was
a
little
annoyed
because
he
did
mention
if
he
was
wearing
the
thicker
vests
as
the
weather
was
getting
chilly
and
begged
me
to
ask
him
to
be
explicit
in
my
next
but
i
did
not
because
it
might
have
shamed
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
countesses
if
he
left
the
letter
about
as
of
course
he
would
george
respects
the
sanctity
of
private
communication
so
much
that
he
never
tore
up
a
letter
in
his
life
the
housemaid
collects
them
when
she
is
doing
his
room
and
brings
them
to
mother
who
has
time
to
read
them
any
more
than
the
housemaid
has
the
third
week
in
august
george
wrote
to
me
and
told
me
to
engage
him
rooms
in
fylingdales
crescent
on
the
east
cliff
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
mother
was
hurt
at
george
having
written
to
me
not
her
on
such
a
pure
matter
of
business
until
i
explained
that
he
merely
did
it
to
please
the
child
one
does
mind
making
oneself
out
a
baby
to
avoid
hurting
a
mother
feelings
i
do
know
if
mother
quite
accepted
this
explanation
but
she
said
no
more
about
it
and
told
aix
the
good
news
he
is
in
lodgings
here
to
be
near
us
aunt
gerty
thinks
it
is
to
be
near
her
and
he
lets
her
think
anything
she
likes
he
looks
forward
to
george
coming
with
great
interest
and
says
he
will
look
like
some
rare
exotic
on
the
beach
such
as
a
or
a
gazelle
aunt
gerty
at
once
got
hold
of
the
visitors
list
let
see
which
of
his
little
lot
is
coming
to
whitby
she
said
and
hunted
carefully
through
three
columns
till
she
found
that
adelaide
countess
of
fylingdales
sidney
robinson
nurse
baby
and
suite
were
at
the
fylingdales
hotel
on
the
east
cliff
lord
fylingdales
her
eldest
son
is
the
widower
of
a
gaiety
girl
who
actually
died
after
she
had
been
a
countess
a
year
poor
dear
aunt
gerty
knew
her
he
is
lord
of
the
manor
here
and
his
portrait
is
all
over
the
place
old
adelaide
a
shocking
frump
lucy
you
need
distress
yourself
about
her
said
aunt
gerty
consolingly
to
mother
i
am
not
distressing
myself
about
her
gertrude
replied
my
mother
and
she
did
look
at
all
distressed
in
her
neat
short
blue
serge
seaside
dress
and
shady
hat
she
looked
ten
i
know
her
son
aunt
gerty
went
on
a
fish
without
a
backbone
i
very
nearly
had
the
privilege
of
leading
him
astray
myself
it
is
irene
lauderdale
now
i
hear
i
wish
you
stow
your
theatrical
recollections
gerty
said
mother
come
tempe
get
your
things
on
we
will
go
and
take
rooms
for
your
father
and
my
husband
brava
said
aix
capital
accent
there
oh
you
go
along
said
mother
and
we
went
off
at
once
and
engaged
george
rooms
we
got
very
nice
large
ones
with
dark
green
outside
shutters
to
the
windows
and
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
explain
george
little
ways
to
them
for
their
sake
as
well
as
his
ben
will
valet
him
mother
told
the
people
that
he
is
bringing
his
man
who
will
however
sleep
out

never
gets
up
till
twelve
french
fashion
poor
ben
he
may
as
well
make
himself
useful
for
he
certainly
ornamental
just
now
he
ca
speak
he
can
only
croak
and
though
he
is
very
big
he
seems
to
have
the
power
of
burrowing
inside
himself
and
bringing
up
a
great
voice
like
a
he
is
not
a
manly
man
yet
but
he
certainly
is
a
boily
boy
he
has
got
some
spots
on
his
face
that
he
thinks
much
bigger
than
they
really
are
and
he
keeps
them
and
himself
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
he
says
just
now
he
does
care
at
all
what
he
does
he
does
even
mind
playing
servant
for
a
bit
if
george
would
like
it
mother
tells
him
he
is
a
good
boy
and
the
comfort
of
her
life
and
that
if
she
can
manage
it
she
will
get
him
sent
to
college
after
this
only
he
had
better
please
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
all
he
can
so
he
means
to
be
a
good
valet
to
the
mammon
the
fylingdales
hotel
is
in
the
best
part
of
the
town
on
the
east
cliff
and
they
dine
late
there
every
evening
and
do
pull
the
blinds
down
and
the
townspeople
walk
backwards
and
forwards
and
watch
the
people
dining
at
dressed
in
their
nudity
i
think
evening
dress
looks
quite
wrong
at
the
seaside
aunt
gerty
and
mother
put
on
a
different
blouse
every
evening
and
look
nice
and
cosy
and
comfortable
though
george
does
say
sarcastic
things
about
the
tyranny
of
the
blouse
and
the
way
aunt
gerty
will
call
it
blowse
i
wash
my
face
that
is
all
the
dressing
do
ben
puts
on
an
old
smoker
of
george
and
flattens
out
his
hair
to
support
the
character
of
being
the
only
gentleman
of
the
party
unless
aix
is
there
to
supper
and
the
less
said
about
aix
clothes
the
better
ben
makes
boats
all
day
when
he
is
in
one
and
ariadne
makes
poetry
her
one
idea
having
come
to
the
sea
for
her
health
is
to
avoid
it
and
seek
the
rather
scrubby
sort
of
woods
which
is
all
you
can
expect
at
the
seaside
so
every
afternoon
nearly
we
take
a
donkey
to
ruswarp
or
to
cock
mill
and
ride
and
tie
we
used
to
pick
out
a
very
smart
donkey
but
a
very
naughty
one
he
was
called
bishop
beck
perhaps
for
that
reason
and
he
went
slow
that
was
to
be
expected
but
when
he
stopped
quite
still
and
would
move
for
an
hour
or
more
in
the
middle
of
cock
mill
wood
long
long
after
one
had
stopped
beating
him
for
he
looked
at
us
and
made
us
feel
ridiculous
ariadne
said
she
would
rather
do
without
adventitious
aid
of
this
kind
for
it
interfered
with
her
afflatus
she
walks
up
and
down
in
the
wood
paths
finding
rhymes
which
seems
the
hardest
part
of
poetry
dreams
streams
gleams
she
goes
on
breams
i
suggest
not
a
poetical
image
it
is
an
image
it
is
a
fish
it
wo
do
am
i
writing
this
poem
or
are
you
i
do
argue
it
does
really
matter
much
how
ariadne
poems
turn
out
being
papa
daughter
she
is
sure
to
find
a
hearty
reception
for
her
initial
volume
of
verse
we
used
to
stay
out
till
what
ariadne
called
dryad
time
she
thought
she
saw
white
figures
hiding
behind
the
trees
in
the
dusk
little
pellets
made
of
nuts
and
acorns
and
dead
leaves
and
so
on
used
to
fall
on
us
out
of
the
thickets
and
ariadne
said
it
was
the
dryads
pelting
us
she
thinks
trees
are
alive
and
that
one
of
the
reasons
you
hear
ghosts
in
all
old
houses
is
the
wood
creaking
because
in
the
night
it
remembers
it
was
once
a
tree
i
prefer
to
believe
in
ordinary
solid
ghosts
instead
of
rational
explanations
like
that
but
still
ariadne
funny
ideas
make
a
walk
quite
interesting
of
course
we
never
talk
of
such
things
at
home
among
materialists
and
realists
like
aunt
gerty
and
mother
and
george
george
makes
plenty
of
use
of
birds
in
his
books
but
he
once
came
home
from
a
visit
to
john
college
at
cambridge
and
told
us
that
he
had
been
kept
awake
all
night
by
a
beastly
nightingale
under
his
window
now
i
have
never
heard
this
bird
but
i
am
sure
from
matthew
arnold
poem
where
he
calls
it
eugenia
it
must
be
a
heavenly
sound
quite
worth
while
being
kept
awake
by
ariadne
and
i
stay
out
very
late
till
it
is
getting
dark
hoping
to
hear
it
in
cock
mill
wood
and
then
we
go
home
and
race
through
supper
and
then
go
out
again
on
the
quays
and
piers
this
time
we
do
know
or
care
what
george
and
his
friends
are
doing
up
above
us
in
the
smart
hotel
on
the
cliff
what
i
should
just
love
would
be
for
some
of
them
and
george
to
come
down
for
a
walk
in
the
dark
and
perhaps
meet
us
and
for
george
to
say
who
are
those
little
wandering
vagabonds
flitting
about
like
bats
why
does
their
father
or
mother
keep
them
at
home
in
the
evenings
it
would
be
so
nice
and
arabian
nightish
at
very
high
tides
we
stay
out
very
late
and
take
a
shawl
and
sit
on
a
capstan
and
tuck
it
round
us
and
listen
for
a
certain
noise
we
love
it
is
when
the
water
gets
into
a
little
corner
in
the
heap
of
stones
by
the
scotch
head
and
gets
sucked
in
among
them
somehow
and
then
we
hear
a
sort
of
sob
that
is
better
than
any
ghost
ariadne
and
i
put
our
heads
under
the
shawl
when
we
hear
it
but
not
quite
so
as
to
prevent
us
hearing
properly
the
harbour
smells
at
low
water
and
the
town
children
yell
and
scream
and
it
is
poetical
then
so
ariadne
and
i
like
to
go
away
on
the
scaur
and
put
our
fingers
in
anemones
mouths
and
pop
seaweed
purses
and
pretend
we
are
lovers
cut
off
by
the
tide
as
they
are
in
novels
in
the
afternoons
when
the
harbour
is
full
we
sit
on
the
mound
above
the
khyber
pass
and
watch
the
water
filling
up
the
hole
between
the
opposite
cliff
and
the
cliff
ladder
it
is
all
quite
quiet
then
we
do
hear
any
town
cries
for
the
children
that
make
the
noise
are
turned
out
of
their
playground
and
their
mothers
out
of
their
good
and
the
boats
begin
to
go
out
of
the
harbour
in
a
long
soft
slow
procession
the
stately
ships
go
their
haven
under
the
i
am
sure
tennyson
meant
whitby
when
he
wrote
that
one
night
we
could
not
sleep
because
the
woman
next
door
had
had
her
man
drowned
and
cried
and
moaned
for
hours
he
was
a
fisherman
and
we
had
seen
his
boat
go
out
third
in
the
row
the
day
before
he
is
supposed
to
have
fallen
overboard
in
the
night
next
day
mother
went
in
and
gave
her
five
shillings
and
she
stopped
crying
aix
had
a
try
to
paint
the
view
in
front
of
our
windows
at
least
he
said
there
was
no
such
thing
in
nature
as
a
view
and
left
out
the
church
and
the
abbey
because
they
conventionalized
things
so
he
belongs
he
said
to
the
impressionist
school
if
any
he
got
quite
excited
about
his
drawing
and
at
last
went
and
borrowed
a
station
truck
to
sit
on
it
raised
him
a
little
one
day
a
chance
lady
sat
down
on
one
of
the
handles
and
over
he
went
it
served
him
right
for
leaving
out
the
two
best
things
in
whitby
when
george
came
ariadne
and
i
used
to
take
turns
to
go
and
lunch
with
him
at
his
breakfast
where
we
had
french
cookery
there
were
leathery
omelets
that
bounced
up
like
the
stick
in
the
boys
game
when
you
touched
the
end
of
them
with
a
spoon
and
fillets
that
you
would
have
condescended
to
have
for
a
pillow
but
still
it
was
french
we
were
dressed
nicely
and
took
our
clean
gloves
in
our
hands
and
george
was
ashamed
of
us
and
introduced
us
to
his
friends
lady
fylingdales
sidney
robinson
said
i
was
like
george
that
i
had
his
nose
i
went
to
bed
that
night
with
a
out
of
the
yard
on
it
to
improve
its
shape
but
the
old
lady
was
half
blind
and
all
made
of
manner
i
also
saw
the
lord
aunt
gerty
might
have
led
astray
and
he
had
a
manner
of
any
sort
and
his
nose
wanted
to
run
away
with
his
chin
george
had
no
fault
whatever
to
find
with
the
arrangements
mother
had
made
for
his
comfort
and
he
told
her
so
the
first
time
he
saw
her
in
baxter
gate
coming
out
of
the
post
office
the
first
place
george
flies
to
in
a
town
is
the
post
office
to
send
telegrams
he
corresponds
entirely
by
telegram
with
some
people
he
says
it
is
paying
more
for
the
privilege
of
saying
less
we
had
been
shopping
george
spotted
us
and
mother
thought
he
had
rather
not
be
recognized
but
he
was
good
that
day
and
he
actually
left
sidney
robinson
a
commoner
married
to
a
countess
and
that
exactly
describes
him
aunt
gerty
says
to
say
a
word
to
his
own
wife
it
was
market
day
and
we
had
bought
several
things
in
the
hall
across
the
water
a
pound
of
blackberries
and
a
cream
cheese
and
a
chicken
and
a
cabbage
each
from
a
different
old
woman
with
a
covered
basket
mother
had
a
net
and
i
a
basket
to
put
them
in
i
was
glad
that
george
did
not
offer
to
relieve
us
of
them
like
the
young
men
aunt
gerty
picks
up
here
but
he
stopped
and
talked
to
us
quite
nicely
for
a
long
time
he
and
mother
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
and
the
began
to
cut
my
arm
in
half
also
it
was
a
very
hot
day
george
had
on
a
white
linen
suit
and
a
straw
hat
from
panama
he
looked
quite
cool
and
like
lohengrin
or
the
baker
man
mother
did
she
looked
hot
i
touched
her
elbow
not
so
much
because
of
my
arm
that
ached
but
because
she
looked
like
that
nor
did
i
think
it
looks
well
to
stand
talking
in
the
street
to
gentlemen
even
if
it
is
your
own
husband
well
george
she
said
taking
my
hint
at
once
we
must
be
going
on
the
butter
is
melting
and
the
chicken
grilling
and
the
cabbage
wilting
while
i
stand
here
talking
to
you
charming
said
george
but
he
was
thinking
of
us
but
of
robinson
who
was
champing
a
few
yards
away
we
said
without
shaking
hands
george
i
think
might
have
lifted
his
hat
i
have
read
of
fine
gentlemen
who
lifted
their
hat
to
an
let
alone
their
wife
and
child
george
and
his
friend
walked
off
together
i
suppose
the
robinson
man
was
too
to
ask
george
who
his
was
as
any
of
aunt
gerty
men
would
do
but
he
certainly
stared
a
good
deal
of
course
he
knows
who
we
are
everybody
in
whitby
does
i
should
think
and
they
most
likely
conclude
that
it
is
less
unkindness
than
the
eccentricity
of
genius
if
you
have
got
that
blasted
thing
called
genius
i
suppose
you
can
bear
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
your
wife
we
walked
slowly
home
with
our
purchases
mother
had
a
headache
all
dinner
and
lay
down
in
the
afternoon
i
met
your
father
ben
she
said
at
supper
his
boots
want
a
little
attention
i
do
believe
said
ben
crossly
that
any
one
ever
had
a
more
tiresome
man
to
valet
he
will
wear
his
clothes
all
wrong
and
then
is
always
ragging
and
jawing
at
a
fellow
because
they
do
look
nice
hush
ben
he
is
your
father
hah
i
was
forgetting
said
ben
and
gave
one
of
his
great
laughs
as
if
you
were
breaking
up
coal
or
something
ben
is
now
so
changeable
and
nervous
that
you
never
know
where
to
have
him
he
is
growing
up
all
wrong
but
what
can
you
expect
of
a
boy
brought
up
by
women
he
never
sees
a
boy
of
his
own
position
though
i
know
that
in
london
he
has
some
low
companions
he
dare
bring
to
the
house
the
hitchings
are
his
only
respectable
friends
but
they
live
such
a
long
way
off
now
jessie
hitchings
is
devoted
to
ben
but
she
is
only
a
girl
like
ariadne
and
me
hitchings
told
mother
years
ago
that
the
boy
was
being
ruined
and
mother
cried
and
said
she
knew
it
but
could
do
nothing
for
his
father
was
by
way
of
educating
him
at
home
till
something
could
be
settled
snaps
of
latin
and
snacks
of
greek
that
is
all
george
gives
the
poor
boy
when
he
has
a
moment
and
that
is
never
this
is
the
only
grievance
mother
has
although
aunt
gerty
is
always
trying
to
persuade
her
she
has
several
and
putting
her
back
up
mother
ends
by
getting
cross
with
her
for
goodness
sake
you
job
comforter
you
leave
off
your
eternal
girding
at
george
ca
you
see
that
as
long
as
a
man
has
his
career
to
establish
his
way
to
make
his
blessed
thoroughfare
is
made
long
ago
or
ought
to
be
that
is
what
i
ca
get
over
you
are
asked
to
get
over
it
it
is
not
your
funeral
it
is
mine
so
shut
up
a
man
like
george
who
is
dependant
on
the
public
favour
needs
to
be
most
absurdly
particular
and
careful
what
he
does
lest
he
injure
his
prestige
look
at
yourself
you
know
very
well
in
your
own
profession
how
very
damaging
it
is
for
an
actor
to
be
married
that
if
an
actress
marries
her
manager
he
has
to
pay
dear
for
it
in
the
receipts
she
had
better
not
figure
as
his
wife
in
the
bills
if
she
wants
him
to
get
on
you
ca
eat
your
cake
i
mean
your
title
and
have
it
no
it
bound
to
be
miss
gertrude
jennynge
on
the
bills
even
if
it
is
in
the
lodgings
with
a
ring
on
her
finger
and
every
right
to
call
herself
a
married
woman
the
public
do
care
for
spliced
idols
an
artist
has
to
stand
clear
and
preserve
his
individuality
such
as
it
is
and
run
straight
all
the
time
i
give
george
credit
for
that
but
there
whatever
the
good
of
it
to
you
a
man
can
make
a
woman
pretty
fairly
miserable
even
if
he
is
to
her
it
then
it
seems
all
wrong
somehow
and
does
give
her
a
chance
of
paying
him
in
his
own
coin
i
think
aunt
gerty
is
the
reason
why
george
fights
so
shy
of
his
family
he
hates
her
style
and
yet
he
can
hardly
forbid
mother
seeing
as
much
as
she
likes
of
her
own
sister
the
trail
of
the
stage
is
over
us
all
not
that
i
see
anything
a
bit
wicked
about
the
stage
myself
i
have
never
noticed
anything
at
all
wrong
and
actors
and
actresses
are
the
kindest
people
in
the
world
but
there
is
a
queer
worn
threadbare
rough
feeling
about
them
off
the
stage
and
i
have
never
seen
them
on
they
are
tired
and
slouchy
and
aunt
gerty
is
most
and
will
do
anything
to
help
a
pal
and
takes
things
as
they
come
those
are
her
good
points
but
she
talks
such
a
lot
about
herself
and
never
opens
a
book
that
is
a
novel
and
wears
cheap
muslins
and
beaded
slippers
in
the
street
and
lots
of
chains
that
seem
to
be
always
getting
caught
on
men
buttons
she
calls
men
fellows
she
is
always
going
to
play
juliet
at
one
of
the
london
houses
meantime
she
puts
up
with
provincial
companies
she
makes
the
best
of
it
and
she
tells
us
she
is
going
to
play
nerissa
in
the
bacon
company
as
if
she
had
got
engaged
for
a
parlourmaid
in
a
good
house
and
discusses
ariel
as
if
ariel
were
a
tweeny
or
girl
between
the
sky
and
the
earth
and
puck
a
smart
clever
buttons
she
speaks
of
her
nice
legs
as
a
workman
might
of
his
bag
of
tools
she
can
sing
and
dance
when
she
is
asked
to
act
she
has
cut
all
her
hair
short
to
make
it
easier
for
wigs
her
great
extravagance
is
in
wigs
she
calls
them
sliding
roofs
for
convenience
in
talking
about
them
in
trains
and
omnibuses
when
she
did
wear
her
own
hair
she
dyed
it
so
i
like
the
wigs
better
as
no
deception
if
mother
was
ever
an
actress
which
i
do
somehow
believe
though
jessie
hitchings
said
once
that
she
had
heard
people
say
so
it
has
all
been
knocked
out
of
her
she
dresses
very
well
always
in
simpler
things
than
aunt
gerty
she
left
off
her
waist
years
ago
to
please
george
and
now
that
it
is
the
fashion
not
to
have
one
she
is
in
the
right
box
i
mean
stays
her
hair
is
brown
and
she
may
frizzle
it
so
it
is
soft
and
pretty
like
a
baby
she
generally
wears
black
over
lovely
white
frilled
petticoats
that
she
gets
up
herself
to
keep
the
bills
down
she
has
such
little
hands
that
she
can
pick
her
gloves
out
of
the
boxes
at
sales
which
are
always
much
reduced
so
few
people
have
small
hands
she
may
not
wear
high
heels
and
that
is
a
grief
to
her
as
she
is
very
tall
but
hers
are
very
pretty
feet
and
she
can
dance
george
does
know
that
she
can
dance
i
do
once
aix
asked
her
to
dance
for
him
when
i
was
in
the
room
aunt
gerty
played
on
the
piano
mother
danced
a
which
i
thought
very
ugly
and
then
a
queer
step
that
a
friend
had
taught
her
when
she
was
a
child
in
one
part
of
it
she
was
dancing
on
her
hands
and
her
feet
at
the
same
time
it
was
the
queerest
thing
and
she
left
her
dress
down
for
that
and
it
lay
in
swirls
about
the
carpet
aix
said
it
was
the
dance
that
salome
must
have
danced
before
herod
and
he
quite
understood
john
the
baptist
and
where
did
she
get
it
but
mother
would
tell
him
she
said
it
was
a
memory
of
her
stormy
youth
in
the
east
end
aix
said
that
she
could
make
her
fortune
doing
it
as
a
turn
at
a
society
music
hall
as
it
would
be
something
quite
new
and
decadent
that
is
just
what
society
wants
the
slight
morbid
flavour
then
mother
put
on
her
short
skirt
and
did
the
ordinary
vulgar
kind
of
dance
they
teach
now
and
i
liked
it
best
she
was
everywhere
at
once
smart
and
spreading
out
in
all
directions
like
spun
glass
on
a
christmas
card
her
eyes
danced
too
ben
said
he
could
have
believed
she
was
his
mother
then
aunt
gerty
performed
and
she
is
professional
but
it
was
not
the
same
thing
aunt
gerty
legs
are
thick
and
compared
with
mother
like
forced
asparagus
to
the
little
pretty
thin
kind
dancing
was
emphatically
dramatic
aix
said
i
asked
him
if
mother
could
act
and
he
answered
my
dear
child
your
mother
can
do
anything
she
has
a
mind
to
then
why
does
she
have
a
mind
i
at
once
said
forgetting
how
it
would
upset
our
household
and
george
if
she
were
to
go
on
the
stage
mother
naturally
remembers
this
and
stays
domestic
out
of
virtue
i
wish
you
would
write
a
play
for
me
aix
said
aunt
gerty
and
i
would
get
a
millionaire
to
run
it
i
wonder
now
what
one
could
do
with
mr
bowser
she
went
off
in
a
brown
study
and
aix
said
rudely
i
will
write
a
play
for
lucy
sooner
looking
at
mother
who
was
sitting
fanning
herself
with
her
she
has
got
the
stuff
in
her
i
do
believe
gad
what
a
chance
what
a
lever
what
a
facer
and
he
dropped
off
into
a
brown
study
too
mother
went
and
mended
blazer
aix
is
staying
with
us
we
have
no
room
in
our
house
he
has
a
room
over
the
wife
but
he
comes
in
to
us
for
his
meals
i
do
believe
george
realizes
this
or
he
would
tell
him
he
is
throwing
himself
away
and
losing
a
good
chance
of
advertising
his
books
aix
books
seem
to
go
without
advertising
more
than
george
do
i
suppose
it
is
because
they
are
so
improper
at
any
rate
he
prefers
to
throw
in
his
lot
with
us
one
day
we
were
all
having
a
at
cock
mill
the
party
consisted
of
mother
me
and
ariadne
aunt
gerty
and
aix
and
an
actor
friend
of
hers
and
his
wife
who
was
acting
for
a
week
at
the
saloon
theatre
bowser
whom
aunt
gerty
wants
either
to
marry
or
get
a
theatre
out
of
was
with
us
too
they
call
him
the
king
of
whitby
because
he
owns
so
many
plots
in
it
and
is
going
to
stand
for
it
in
the
brewing
interest
next
election
we
had
secured
the
nicest
table
the
one
nearest
the
stream
and
had
just
tucked
our
legs
neatly
under
it
when
a
carriage
drove
up
aunt
gerty
and
the
king
of
whitby
were
at
that
moment
in
the
old
cottage
who
gives
us
the
hot
water
toasting
the
fylingdales
party
got
out
of
that
carriage
and
george
got
slowly
down
off
the
box
they
trooped
into
the
enclosure
and
sidney
robinson
trying
to
be
funny
asked
the
old
woman
if
she
could
see
her
way
to
giving
them
some
tea
here
o
puppose
sir
said
she
as
of
course
she
is
she
pointed
out
the
table
that
was
left
and
that
led
them
past
us
if
aunt
gerty
had
been
there
with
bowser
she
would
certainly
have
claimed
george
as
a
relation
and
said
something
awkward
but
she
was
luckily
toasting
and
had
perhaps
not
even
seen
them
i
saw
george
just
look
at
mother
and
i
saw
her
smile
a
very
little
and
make
him
a
sign
that
he
was
to
go
right
past
us
and
not
speak
or
seem
to
know
us
before
of
course
aix
never
spoils
any
one
game
not
even
george
so
he
went
on
talking
hard
to
the
actor
wife
though
i
saw
his
lip
curl
i
of
course
never
need
be
given
a
cue
twice
so
i
kicked
mother
hard
under
the
table
for
sympathy
but
preserved
a
calm
superior
aunt
gerty
and
bowser
came
out
with
plates
full
of
they
had
cooked
and
i
did
know
if
it
was
the
fire
or
bowser
had
made
aunt
gerty
cheeks
so
red
i
hoped
the
latter
for
her
sake
they
had
no
idea
of
what
had
happened
while
they
had
been
toasting
and
flirting
it
appeared
from
their
manners
which
were
bad
aunt
gerty
always
puts
an
extra
polish
on
hers
when
george
is
present
and
even
bowser
would
have
added
a
frill
or
so
to
suit
the
aristocracy
our
party
was
very
gay
actors
all
can
make
you
laugh
if
they
can
do
nothing
else
and
our
shrieks
of
laughter
must
have
made
the
other
party
quite
envious
for
they
were
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
as
dull
as
the
stream
all
overshadowed
with
and
alders
that
grew
over
it
just
there
suddenly
george
got
up
and
left
them
and
came
over
to
us
and
aunt
gerty
swallowed
her
tea
the
wrong
way
round
and
had
to
have
her
shoulder
thumped
george
took
no
notice
of
her
but
put
his
hand
on
aix
shoulder
and
said
something
to
him
in
a
low
voice
not
if
i
know
it
aix
answered
quite
violently
adding
many
thanks
old
fellow
i
am
happier
where
i
am
george
looked
awfully
put
out
of
course
i
knew
what
he
wanted
those
smart
people
up
at
the
other
table
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
aix
he
is
a
successful
though
painfully
realistic
novelist
and
george
had
told
them
he
was
actually
sitting
at
the
next
table
and
had
promised
to
bring
him
over
to
them
to
be
introduced
in
his
disappointment
he
glared
at
us
all
especially
the
actor
who
did
care
a
brass
farthing
for
george
displeasure
and
went
on
eating
oh
all
right
said
george
to
cover
his
vexation
if
you
prefer
to
bury
yourself
in
a
easy
all
aix
said
leave
everybody
to
enjoy
themselves
in
their
own
way
and
we
are
depriving
your
delightful
friends
of
george
had
turned
and
gone
back
to
his
delightful
friends
long
before
aix
had
finished
his
sentence
and
aunt
gerty
patted
the
poor
man
on
the
back
till
he
wriggled
loyal
fellow
she
said
several
times
she
had
got
well
on
to
it
now
and
she
started
a
fit
of
giggles
that
lasted
all
the
rest
of
the
time
we
were
there
it
did
matter
much
for
we
were
all
quite
drunk
on
weak
tea
and
laughter
but
we
turned
as
silent
as
mice
as
the
fylingdales
party
having
had
enough
of
their
dull
tea
streamed
past
us
and
got
into
their
carriage
and
rolled
away
george
was
not
with
them
i
dare
say
he
had
got
over
the
hedge
and
gone
round
to
meet
the
break
by
the
road
not
wanting
to
walk
past
our
party
again
and
to
avoid
unpleasantness
i
supposed
he
had
paid
for
the
tea
but
no
this
grand
party
forgot
to
do
that
so
that
in
the
end
aix
paid
for
their
refreshment
for
the
old
sake
that
she
should
not
suffer
when
they
had
gone
we
felt
relieved
but
it
sobered
us
somehow
aunt
gerty
and
the
gentlemen
smoked
quietly
and
we
were
so
still
that
we
could
hear
the
little
beck
bubbling
over
the
loose
stones
beside
us
then
aunt
gerty
was
persuaded
to
recite
something
and
she
did
loraine
loraine
loree
in
a
shy
modest
voice
you
see
these
were
all
her
real
bosses
and
she
valued
their
approval
and
the
actor
wife
is
considered
very
stiff
in
the
profession
she
herself
sang
the
banks
of
allan
water
very
sadly
and
solidly
and
aunt
gerty
cried
to
cheer
us
all
up
again
the
actor
rather
a
famous
one
d
l
did
one
of
his
humorous
recitations
out
of
his
london
repertory
for
us
so
that
we
nearly
died
with
laughing
and
aunt
gerty
dried
her
tears
and
whispered
to
me
that
trying
to
laugh
like
a
lady
was
so
painful
that
she
longed
to
take
a
short
cut
out
of
her
stays
chapter
xiii
lady
scilly
came
to
whitby
and
took
a
big
house
in
hilda
terrace
they
ca
be
parted
long
poor
things
aunt
gerty
said
and
mother
hushed
her
she
brought
her
great
friend
miss
irene
lauderdale
with
her
for
a
good
blow
before
she
went
to
america
then
all
the
shops
came
out
with
portraits
of
irene
in
smalls
as
dick
turpin
and
irene
as
the
pumpeydore
and
irene
as
greek
slave
and
irene
in
venus
they
had
her
on
picture
postcards
too
in
all
the
principal
stationers
windows
i
should
have
thought
she
would
have
been
ashamed
to
walk
down
the
street
hung
with
her
own
likeness
like
a
row
of
that
reflected
her
but
these
very
languid
what
aunt
gerty
calls
sort
of
people
can
stand
anything
so
long
as
it
public
when
she
was
dressed
up
as
turpin
or
pompadour
or
venus
she
was
just
a
tall
thin
and
woman
she
had
red
lips
that
stuck
out
a
long
long
way
and
crinkly
red
hair
and
large
eyes
like
two
coming
at
you
down
the
street
she
generally
had
a
dog
with
her
and
its
lead
kept
getting
twisted
round
the
wheels
of
carts
and
round
my
father
legs
as
he
walked
along
skinner
street
beside
her
he
would
have
stood
that
from
any
one
but
a
popular
favourite
i
was
walking
along
behind
them
a
few
days
after
she
came
with
aunt
gerty
they
stopped
at
truelove
and
looked
at
the
she
became
very
serious
all
at
once
i
must
go
in
and
procure
myself
she
said
to
george
sniggling
in
they
went
and
aunt
gerty
and
i
walked
in
after
them
shop
and
library
are
very
dark
as
for
the
morality
of
it
we
had
as
good
a
right
to
buy
as
they
and
as
i
had
ascertained
from
other
rencounters
of
this
kind
george
knows
very
well
how
to
ignore
his
family
when
needful
for
his
policy
i
do
not
resent
it
for
one
never
knows
how
a
daughter
presence
may
interfere
with
a
plans
and
arrangements
and
i
am
sure
i
do
want
to
injure
his
sales
irene
turned
over
all
the
cards
including
the
venus
set
and
did
not
approve
of
them
especially
of
the
ones
where
she
is
turning
away
her
face
altogether
the
blighted
idiot
she
said
meaning
i
suppose
the
photographer
has
completely
missed
my
beautiful
botticelli
back
the
effect
is
decidedly
meretricious
i
am
a
very
good
woman
ah
these
are
better
she
had
got
hold
of
some
of
herself
in
a
spoon
bonnet
and
long
jacket
and
she
sang
out
loud
while
aunt
gerty
open
mouth
betrayed
her
shock
at
her
audacity
oh
i
contrition
eliza
and
she
salvation
jane
we
once
were
wrong
we
now
are
right
we
never
go
wrong
again
i
ca
quite
promise
that
alas
my
friends
wo
let
me
i
will
send
salvation
jane
to
lord
r
y
a
very
dear
old
friend
of
mine
a
dozen
dozen
please
is
that
a
gross
oh
what
a
naughty
word
will
you
pay
mr
good
business
said
my
aunt
let
me
see
how
much
has
she
rooked
him
please
do
ask
me
to
do
sums
said
i
besides
george
has
a
perfect
right
to
do
as
he
pleases
with
his
own
money
george
paid
cheerfully
and
then
asked
for
some
cards
with
cats
on
them
whatever
do
you
want
them
for
asked
irene
he
never
lets
me
say
whatever
to
send
to
my
children
ah
yes
your
sweet
children
where
are
they
she
asked
in
the
nursery
was
george
answer
as
if
he
cared
whether
we
were
in
the
copper
or
the
stockpot
it
saved
him
from
having
to
say
whitby
however
and
now
she
said
do
me
a
great
kindness
buy
me
your
last
great
book
there
ought
to
be
some
of
my
work
here
george
replied
gravely
and
made
a
move
in
our
direction
where
truelove
was
truelove
sings
in
the
choir
at
the
church
upon
the
hill
and
so
loud
she
would
bring
the
roof
off
nearly
but
in
her
own
shop
she
is
as
mild
as
a
lamb
george
asked
her
for
of
which
the
heroine
is
a
tuscan
cow
and
pretty
of
which
lady
scilly
is
the
heroine
and
light
that
was
on
land
and
and
of
which
the
hero
really
was
a
pieman
only
an
italian
one
poor
truelove
looked
blank
i
am
afraid
sir
we
do
not
stock
them
but
i
can
order
george
interrupted
her
such
is
fame
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
you
were
to
ask
for
any
one
of
aix
books
or
or
you
would
be
offered
a
plethora
of
them
irene
took
her
cue
but
she
drawled
it
is
extraordinary
impossible
inconceivable
books
like
yours
that
rejoice
the
thirsty
soul
that
refrigerate
the
arid
body
that
bring
god
great
gift
of
sunshine
down
into
our
too
gloomy
grey
homes
i
always
say
this
dear
dear
that
you
of
all
men
have
caught
the
secret
of
imprisoning
the
jolly
sunbeams
every
page
of
yours
is
instinct
with
light
it
sounded
like
an
advertisement
of
some
new
kind
of
soap
aunt
gerty
did
like
it
at
all
and
in
a
rage
with
george
she
put
out
her
hand
suddenly
and
spilt
a
vase
of
flowers
in
water
brute
she
said
and
the
assistant
who
mopped
up
the
water
kept
saying
not
at
all
not
thinking
aunt
gerty
meant
the
gentleman
who
had
just
left
the
shop
in
haste
but
as
apologizing
for
her
own
stupidity
in
upsetting
the
water
who
was
that
lady
i
asked
aunt
gerty
as
we
went
home
though
i
knew
well
enough
izzie
lawder
a
lady
i
remember
her
well
perhaps
i
had
better
say
what
i
remember
her
she
and
i
she
had
got
on
a
bit
ahead
of
me
even
then
played
together
at
the
in
darling
ten
years
ago
she
has
got
on
since
everybody
to
give
her
a
leg
up
you
know
the
sort
dyed
hair
and
interest
she
soon
left
nice
honest
me
behind
had
you
the
interest
aunt
gerty
i
knew
she
had
the
other
thing
do
be
impertinent
miss
let
us
get
home
and
tell
lucy
wo
she
be
electrified
but
mother
was
a
bit
electrified
all
in
the
way
of
business
my
dear
girl
she
said
to
aunt
gerty
who
chattered
about
irene
all
the
rest
of
that
day
do
subside
about
my
wrongs
if
you
do
mind
i
dare
say
he
wants
to
get
her
to
play
lead
in
the
drama
he
is
writing
with
lady
scilly
and
that
is
why
he
is
so
civil
to
her
another
amateur
what
will
they
make
of
it
snorted
aunt
gerty
irene
lauderdale
is
lady
scilly
best
friend
best
enemy
you
mean
however
it
is
the
same
thing
these
unnatural
friendships
between
society
women
and
actresses
sicken
me
always
in
each
other
pockets
it
is
a
bad
advertisement
for
them
both
and
there
she
was
plastering
george
up
with
compliments
about
his
books
that
i
do
believe
she
has
ever
read
a
single
one
of
sunshine
indeed
he
may
well
put
sunshine
into
his
novels
he
has
taken
pretty
good
care
to
take
it
all
out
of
one
poor
woman
life
i
am
perfectly
happy
gertrude
i
look
happy
i
am
sure
you
sham
it
that
is
the
next
best
thing
to
being
it
a
wretched
substitute
you
are
a
right
good
sort
lucy
and
have
got
a
husband
that
does
come
within
a
hundred
miles
of
appreciating
you
yes
he
does
and
at
my
true
value
i
suspect
i
am
good
for
what
i
do
i
know
my
place
and
i
fill
it
i
should
only
hamper
george
if
i
insisted
on
sharing
his
life
and
knowing
his
friends
i
am
too
low
for
some
of
them
i
admit
but
i
am
too
high
for
irene
lauderdale
i
condescend
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
i
despise
and
scorn
her
said
mother
quite
loudly
for
her
and
suddenly
too
as
she
began
so
mild
i
thought
what
a
good
actress
she
would
have
made
i
believe
aunt
gerty
thought
so
too
for
she
screamed
out
bravo
luce
mother
burst
into
tears
i
do
think
it
is
nice
for
a
daughter
to
see
a
mother
tears
so
i
left
the
room
and
went
into
the
back
room
where
ben
was
messing
at
something
as
boys
will
i
told
him
on
no
account
whatever
to
go
into
the
front
room
to
mother
till
had
elapsed
i
thought
that
was
enough
law
to
give
her
ben
naturally
asked
why
and
hit
me
over
the
head
not
hard
ben
is
a
gentleman
and
always
tempers
the
blow
to
the
shy
sister
but
still
i
preferred
taking
a
whack
to
giving
mother
away
a
few
days
after
that
mother
went
up
to
fylingdales
crescent
to
see
george
on
business
and
found
him
in
bed
with
a
bad
cold
you
see
these
society
people
who
are
only
getting
their
amusement
cheap
out
of
george
do
understand
the
constitution
of
their
toy
and
he
like
to
let
them
see
that
he
is
only
a
mortal
author
and
that
it
is
death
to
him
to
be
without
his
hat
for
a
minute
or
his
coat
for
he
has
got
a
very
sensitive
mucous
membrane
and
catches
cold
in
no
time
i
sometimes
think
it
is
the
opposite
of
with
him
george
himself
into
his
colds
he
says
that
the
sensitive
mucous
is
the
invariable
concomitant
of
the
artistic
temperament
which
he
has
aix
says
he
has
that
what
he
has
is
the
one
and
that
makes
george
very
angry
however
this
may
be
the
tiniest
bit
of
swagger
costs
him
a
cold
in
the
head
and
that
is
what
he
has
now
he
had
already
altered
his
will
and
begun
to
talk
of
flying
to
the
south
to
be
extinguished
there
gently
when
mother
came
to
him
my
dear
boy
no
mother
said
and
george
groaned
as
he
always
does
when
she
calls
him
boy
but
invalids
ca
be
choosers
of
phrases
you
are
going
to
die
just
yet
she
went
on
kindly
banging
his
pillows
about
i
shall
have
to
stay
here
with
you
a
little
though
i
fancy
to
look
after
you
i
should
wonder
if
they
did
make
objections
in
the
house
there
will
be
a
bit
of
a
fuss
who
will
make
a
fuss
mother
i
asked
and
why
should
they
do
ask
questions
about
what
you
do
understand
mother
said
sharply
though
what
else
really
should
i
ask
questions
about
run
home
and
tell
your
aunt
that
i
am
going
to
get
a
room
here
for
a
night
or
two
and
that
she
is
to
send
my
things
just
what
i
want
for
a
couple
of
nights
and
toothbrush
said
i
as
i
left
george
put
out
his
hand
to
mother
and
said
quite
nicely
you
are
very
good
to
me
dear
and
can
you
really
stay
and
soothe
the
sick
man
pillow
mother
sat
down
and
put
the
blanket
in
its
proper
place
not
grazing
his
cheek
and
gave
him
a
drink
and
read
to
him
out
of
anatole
france
she
kept
saying
i
they
think
i
am
not
respectable
the
thought
seemed
to
amuse
her
very
much
and
george
too
and
i
left
them
and
went
home
and
gave
aunt
gerty
her
directions
aunt
gerty
chuckled
as
mother
had
said
she
would
and
said
this
will
clear
up
george
ideas
a
little
nothing
like
an
ugly
illness
for
letting
a
man
know
who
his
true
friends
are
looks
lovely
do
he
is
its
blessed
poet
nose
a
good
deal
swollen
i
said
no
george
looked
very
nice
in
bed
a
mixture
of
the
pope
and
napoleon
combined
i
left
her
and
went
back
to
mother
with
her
things
george
by
that
time
was
arranged
he
had
a
silk
handkerchief
tied
over
his
forehead
he
said
he
did
that
to
keep
his
brain
from
being
too
active
like
the
british
workman
girds
his
loins
with
a
belt
before
he
begins
to
dig
he
looked
very
happy
and
quite
stupid
i
took
our
cat
robert
the
devil
up
with
me
and
put
him
on
george
chest
to
soothe
him
it
did
and
he
played
with
my
hair
i
am
an
angel
when
i
am
ill
he
said
do
you
find
me
so
strong
natures
like
mine
mother
then
came
in
with
a
great
bunch
of
roses
seaside
roses
always
look
coarse
i
think
and
a
lot
of
cards
lord
and
lady
scilly
and
lady
fylingdales
and
sidney
robinson
and
lord
john
daman
have
called
to
inquire
and
miss
irene
lauderdale
has
left
these
flowers
for
you
george
look
at
them
and
be
done
with
it
for
i
do
mean
to
have
them
left
messing
about
in
my
exhausting
the
air
tempe
can
take
them
home
when
you
have
smelt
them
though
i
do
suppose
you
can
smell
anything
just
now
she
put
them
to
his
nose
and
he
smelt
irene
card
was
on
the
top
it
had
a
monogram
in
one
corner
a
gold
skull
and
crossbones
i
never
heard
of
people
having
their
monogram
on
their
before
but
one
lives
and
learns
i
do
of
course
expect
you
to
admire
the
lauderdale
as
a
woman
george
said
but
what
as
a
dramatic
authority
do
you
think
of
her
as
an
actress
i
consider
that
dear
old
ger
could
do
quite
as
well
if
she
had
one
half
her
chances
mother
said
eagerly
no
doubt
no
doubt
the
cleverness
lies
in
laying
hold
of
the
chances
irene
has
a
genius
for
advertisement
look
after
the
said
my
mother
and
the
acts
will
take
care
of
themselves
good
said
george
i
should
like
to
have
said
that
myself
i
dare
say
you
will
george
said
mother
quite
nicely
when
once
i
get
you
well
again
i
do
think
mother
is
rather
fond
of
george
she
got
him
cured
in
less
than
a
week
but
she
did
let
him
out
once
during
that
time
and
had
him
all
to
herself
it
was
great
fun
seeing
all
his
friends
wandering
about
whitby
bored
to
death
because
was
confined
to
the
house
they
used
to
get
hold
of
me
and
ariadne
and
ask
us
how
long
they
were
going
to
be
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
his
society
they
knew
who
we
were
by
this
time
and
made
pets
of
us
as
much
as
we
would
let
them
i
was
too
proud
but
ariadne
decision
was
complicated
by
a
hopeless
attachment
she
had
started
love
is
enough
she
used
to
say
and
i
go
to
saltergate
with
the
scillys
for
simon
is
going
chapter
xiv
the
young
man
that
ariadne
loves
is
a
more
than
friend
of
lady
scilly
and
i
knew
him
first
he
was
there
that
day
i
lunched
for
the
first
time
on
i
remember
ariadne
hardly
knew
him
till
we
came
here
though
they
had
both
taken
part
in
christina
wedding
he
had
just
noticed
her
then
for
once
she
was
well
turned
out
on
the
strength
of
that
notice
she
asked
him
to
call
and
he
did
he
would
call
now
if
she
asked
him
but
we
do
want
him
coming
to
the
house
on
the
quay
for
we
could
insulate
aunt
gerty
he
stays
with
lady
scilly
in
the
house
she
has
taken
in
terrace
irene
lauderdale
is
there
he
hates
irene
and
contrives
never
to
be
in
her
company
more
than
he
can
help
that
one
to
us
his
own
family
lives
up
in
the
dales
pickering
way
george
stayed
there
once
when
lady
hermyre
was
alive
and
builds
a
sort
of
little
recitation
on
what
he
observed
in
his
friend
house
whatever
ormolu
is
buhl
there
are
six
portland
vases
along
the
cornice
of
the
house
containing
the
ashes
of
the
family
portraits
of
stiff
horses
and
squat
owners
all
the
way
everything
including
the
butler
excessively
excepting
the
portraits
of
the
ladies
of
the
family
frowning
ascetically
over
their
own
bodices
à
sir
frederick
is
one
of
the
most
prominent
racing
men
of
yorkshire
and
the
stables
are
model
but
the
house
is
prayers
bed
at
ten
no
bridge
and
early
breakfast
and
prayers
again
i
do
think
george
will
ever
be
asked
again
but
i
do
wonder
lady
scilly
was
able
to
get
hold
of
simon
does
frown
over
her
bodices
and
she
is
amusing
in
her
silly
way
simon
hangs
round
like
one
of
those
young
puppies
at
walk
that
one
sees
in
the
villages
and
lord
scilly
looks
after
his
future
and
got
him
into
the
foreign
office
i
believe
though
lord
scilly
twigs
about
ariadne
caring
for
him
that
lady
scilly
does
or
else
she
would
not
let
him
out
so
freely
she
would
be
like
most
teachers
and
insist
on
her
pupil
finishing
his
term
a
wise
woman
would
not
have
brought
irene
lauderdale
down
here
to
preoccupy
her
it
will
take
her
all
her
time
to
keep
simon
away
from
ariadne
if
once
i
give
my
mind
to
it
i
do
ariadne
and
simon
make
appointments
but
they
keep
them
i
am
generally
there
but
i
count
there
is
the
geological
museum
on
the
quay
which
is
never
used
for
anything
but
casual
appointments
and
the
old
library
where
they
have
all
the
people
gaskell
and
miss
jewsbury
and
oliphant
ariadne
and
i
read
three
a
day
regularly
we
sometimes
meet
simon
on
the
quay
when
we
are
carrying
a
whole
hodful
and
ariadne
wo
let
him
carry
them
for
her
she
does
like
him
to
know
that
she
is
reading
all
about
love
simon
does
really
want
to
find
out
he
never
wants
very
much
anything
he
never
fights
any
point
that
is
what
i
like
about
him
and
hate
about
bohemians
they
never
glide
or
slip
over
things
they
always
scrape
and
drag
and
insist
but
people
who
have
got
their
roots
in
the
country
as
simon
has
are
simple
and
not
fussy
and
have
no
fads
i
wonder
what
simon
thinks
of
george
it
is
the
last
thing
he
would
tell
me
or
ariadne
he
likes
aix
rather
but
he
would
not
perhaps
if
he
had
read
any
of
his
novels
aix
makes
him
laugh
and
i
like
to
hear
his
nice
little
curly
laugh
if
only
simon
eyes
were
bigger
he
really
would
be
very
handsome
ariadne
however
are
big
enough
for
two
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
ever
been
in
love
she
says
and
it
hurts
women
it
does
hurt
a
man
who
loves
in
vain
only
clears
up
his
ideas
a
little
and
shows
him
the
kind
of
girl
he
really
does
want
when
the
first
choice
refuses
him
a
refusal
from
first
choice
only
sends
him
straight
off
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
to
second
choice
who
is
waiting
for
the
chance
of
him
i
am
sure
that
is
the
way
most
marriages
are
made
hearts
on
the
rebound
the
first
girl
is
a
true
benefactor
to
her
species
and
gets
her
fun
and
her
practice
into
the
bargain
ariadne
has
now
reduced
this
to
a
system
from
novels
in
refusing
you
must
remember
to
hope
after
you
have
said
that
it
can
never
be
that
you
will
at
least
always
be
friends
with
regard
to
accepting
she
thinks
and
i
think
that
the
nicest
way
is
to
hide
your
burning
face
on
the
lapel
of
his
coat
and
say
nothing
and
then
when
you
come
up
again
the
rough
stuff
of
his
coat
has
made
you
blush
a
thing
neither
ariadne
nor
i
have
ever
been
able
to
manage
for
ourselves
novels
tell
you
all
sorts
of
things
for
instance
when
and
what
to
resent
otherwise
you
might
say
thank
you
for
what
is
really
an
affront
out
on
the
cliff
walk
the
other
day
it
came
on
to
rain
and
a
man
offered
to
lend
ariadne
his
umbrella
and
see
her
to
her
own
door
a
harmless
nay
useful
proposal
but
my
sister
knew
from
novels
that
that
sort
of
thing
leads
to
all
sorts
of
wickedness
and
that
she
must
unconditionally
absolutely
refuse
she
was
at
having
to
sacrifice
her
best
hat
but
bravely
bowed
and
refused
his
offer
and
went
off
in
the
rain
feeling
his
disappointed
eyes
right
through
the
back
of
her
head
and
hearing
the
of
the
on
the
crown
of
her
hat
all
the
way
home
but
she
had
behaved
well
that
was
her
consolation
aunt
gerty
took
that
man
on
afterwards
she
met
him
turning
out
of
the
at
the
saloon
and
he
offered
the
very
same
umbrella
aunt
gerty
accepted
it
and
hopes
to
accept
the
owner
too
some
day
for
it
was
bowser
ariadne
goes
the
wrong
way
to
work
her
one
idea
when
she
gets
on
at
all
with
any
man
and
she
does
get
on
with
simon
that
is
certain
is
to
collar
him
to
curtail
his
liberty
and
give
him
as
many
opportunities
of
being
alone
with
her
as
she
can
she
says
it
is
an
universal
feminine
instinct
very
well
if
she
chooses
to
be
guided
by
this
wretched
feminine
instinct
she
will
muff
the
whole
thing
she
should
let
the
idea
of
being
alone
with
her
come
from
him
lead
him
on
to
propose
it
and
manage
it
himself
and
then
squash
it
men
are
very
easily
put
off
or
frightened
a
racehorse
is
in
it
with
them
to
feel
at
ease
they
must
be
made
to
think
that
it
is
all
quite
casual
that
nobody
has
arranged
anything
and
that
as
for
themselves
though
there
is
no
harm
in
them
no
one
particularly
wants
them
if
they
can
get
it
into
their
heads
that
they
wo
be
conspicuous
by
their
absence
they
buck
up
immediately
and
want
to
be
in
your
pocket
when
one
is
at
a
theatre
one
is
quite
comforted
by
the
sight
of
extra
exit
stuck
up
here
and
there
although
i
dare
say
if
you
came
to
thump
at
those
doors
in
despair
you
would
find
it
no
go
so
when
ariadne
makes
a
face
at
me
to
leave
her
i
do
see
it
i
sit
tight
wherever
we
are
knowing
that
young
men
adore
being
chaperoned
and
at
parties
if
you
notice
the
one
woman
they
never
throw
a
word
to
is
the
woman
they
adore
and
mean
to
secure
they
want
to
marry
her
not
talk
to
her
the
casual
society
girl
will
do
for
that
ariadne
sometimes
comes
back
from
a
party
quite
disconsolate
because
said
a
word
more
than
was
strictly
necessary
for
politeness
to
her
excelsior
i
said
i
do
really
believe
he
is
thinking
of
it
simon
always
seems
to
have
plenty
of
and
gives
to
beggars
in
the
street
yet
his
eyes
are
little
and
cook
always
said
that
that
goes
with
meanness
anyway
they
are
very
bright
like
an
animal
that
you
come
on
suddenly
in
a
clump
of
green
in
a
wood
perhaps
i
mean
a
hare
he
always
sees
jokes
first
and
looks
up
and
laughs
he
is
very
keen
on
hunting
and
singing
but
his
father
snubs
him
and
says
he
does
ride
as
straight
as
almeria
and
has
no
more
voice
than
an
old
he
would
see
better
to
ride
if
he
was
anyway
i
believe
he
ever
reads
except
sponge
tour
and
something
or
other
and
books
in
the
badminton
library
he
knows
a
little
history
about
hilda
and
the
abbey
and
i
should
be
surprised
to
hear
that
he
thought
she
was
some
sort
of
ancestress
of
his
and
that
cædmon
was
a
about
his
aunt
estate
i
feel
quite
like
a
mother
to
him
and
ariadne
loves
him
passionately
and
is
leaving
off
eating
for
his
sake
not
on
purpose
exactly
but
because
she
is
so
worried
about
him
he
is
awfully
nice
to
her
but
he
never
gets
any
nicer
he
is
nice
to
anybody
it
is
only
because
ariadne
is
the
only
girl
in
the
set
here
about
his
own
age
that
it
seems
as
if
it
would
be
neat
and
right
that
he
should
fall
in
love
with
her
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
simon
can
fall
in
love
it
is
the
dull
men
who
do
that
best
not
the
universal
favourites
but
if
simon
has
any
love
latent
i
am
anxious
to
get
it
all
for
ariadne
she
hates
herrings
now
and
does
care
for
cream
she
lives
principally
on
and
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
go
about
eleven
in
the
morning
to
that
shop
on
the
quay
and
eat
tarts
and
standing
and
watch
people
pass
and
the
bridge
opening
and
shutting
to
let
tall
funnels
go
through
ariadne
sometimes
has
to
wade
through
tarts
before
simon
and
lady
scilly
and
the
dogs
and
the
rest
of
them
come
round
the
corner
of
flowergate
and
surely
it
is
a
pity
to
spoil
your
complexion
for
the
sake
of
any
young
man
in
the
world
no
digestion
could
stand
the
way
ariadne
treats
hers
for
long
she
plays
it
very
low
down
on
her
constitution
generally
she
wo
go
to
bed
till
awfully
late
but
sits
by
the
window
telling
her
sorrow
to
the
sea
and
the
stars
and
writing
poems
to
the
that
never
moans
that
i
know
of
luckily
as
yet
it
does
show
in
her
face
that
she
has
been
burning
the
midnight
oil
or
candles
she
burns
three
short
fours
a
night
sometimes
that
she
buys
herself
she
has
made
three
pounds
altogether
by
writing
poems
that
aix
puts
in
an
american
paper
for
her
she
does
let
simon
know
that
she
publishes
for
it
would
discredit
her
in
his
eyes
he
says
there
no
harm
in
girls
scribbling
if
they
like
but
he
is
jolly
well
glad
his
sister
does
simon
is
proud
of
his
sister
almeria
and
thinks
her
a
splendid
girl
she
lives
at
their
place
with
her
widowed
father
eight
miles
inland
and
only
comes
to
whitby
when
rough
weather
and
wrecks
are
expected
then
every
one
walks
up
and
down
the
pier
and
hopes
that
a
hapless
barque
will
come
drifting
to
their
very
feet
i
do
mean
we
actually
want
there
to
be
a
wreck
but
if
it
has
to
be
it
may
as
well
be
where
one
can
see
it
for
ariadne
has
a
tender
heart
and
when
aunt
gerty
put
the
loaf
upside
down
on
the
trencher
the
other
day
ariadne
at
once
kindly
put
it
on
its
right
end
again
for
a
loaf
upside
down
always
betokens
a
wreck
and
she
knows
all
the
superstitions
there
are
the
two
piers
here
are
so
awkwardly
placed
that
in
rough
weather
the
poor
boats
ca
always
clear
them
so
it
is
a
regular
party
on
the
pier
when
the
south
cone
is
hoisted
at
the
irene
lauderdale
wears
a
little
shawl
over
her
head
like
a
factory
girl
it
ca
blow
away
she
says
she
has
been
photographed
like
that
with
lord
fylingdales
they
say
she
is
going
to
marry
him
and
do
what
aunt
gerty
refused
to
do
i
do
know
if
they
are
a
very
united
family
but
certainly
his
sisters
chaperon
him
most
carefully
and
have
taken
care
to
be
great
friends
with
irene
so
as
to
have
an
excuse
for
being
always
with
her
lord
fylingdales
never
gets
a
chance
of
seeing
her
alone
dear
emily
lady
fenton
and
dear
louisa
hugh
gore
are
devoted
to
dear
irene
and
she
thinks
it
is
because
she
is
so
nice
so
good
form
not
because
she
is
so
nasty
they
perfectly
loathe
and
detest
her
i
heard
lady
fenton
abusing
her
to
some
one
talking
in
the
same
breath
of
almeria
hermyre
as
one
of
us
the
sisters
would
prefer
lord
fylingdales
to
marry
his
cousin
almeria
of
course
but
her
is
simply
appalling
she
wears
plain
skirts
and
caps
and
no
fringe
george
says
she
has
the
most
uncompromising
forehead
he
ever
saw
a
with
a
vengeance
i
should
think
she
soaps
it
well
every
morning
it
looks
like
that
her
father
is
about
as
queer
as
an
old
family
can
make
him
i
wish
some
one
would
tell
me
why
if
you
came
in
with
the
conqueror
you
are
generally
queer
or
without
a
chin
why
do
you
always
marry
your
near
relations
do
you
get
queerer
as
you
go
on
no
one
ever
answers
these
questions
sir
frederick
hermyre
has
acres
of
stubbly
chin
true
but
he
takes
it
out
in
queerness
he
always
wears
white
duck
trousers
like
the
pictures
of
wellington
whom
he
is
rather
like
he
says
what
is
the
good
of
being
a
gentleman
if
you
ca
wear
a
shabby
coat
and
does
wear
it
his
house
at
highsam
is
a
show
house
only
they
do
show
it
they
are
too
careless
and
too
untidy
and
too
mean
in
the
shape
of
housekeepers
one
day
some
whitby
tourists
went
over
to
saltergate
in
a
break
and
strolled
up
his
drive
to
look
at
the
jacobean
front
and
met
sir
frederick
as
shabby
as
usual
he
had
been
working
in
a
stone
quarry
he
has
there
i
believe
did
you
wish
to
see
me
he
asked
the
front
tourist
politely
thanks
old
cock
any
extra
charge
said
the
tourist
it
was
of
course
all
the
fault
of
those
old
trousers
and
linen
coat
and
i
have
heard
that
sir
frederick
was
not
so
very
angry
and
stood
the
man
a
glass
of
beer
he
is
a
liberal
in
spite
of
owning
land
simon
is
a
conservative
eldest
sons
are
always
different
politics
to
their
fathers
we
never
see
the
old
man
hardly
except
on
these
stormy
pier
parties
and
then
he
stalks
up
and
down
the
pier
with
his
daughter
among
us
all
and
though
he
is
exactly
rude
to
anybody
he
never
seems
to
hear
or
care
to
hear
what
anybody
is
saying
blood
tells
lady
scilly
has
given
him
up
in
disgust
long
ago
he
simply
answered
her
straight
as
long
as
he
could
and
when
he
did
understand
her
he
just
shook
his
head
and
grinned
and
turned
away
simon
stood
by
looking
rather
like
a
little
whipped
dog
he
is
awfully
afraid
of
his
father
who
is
proud
of
him
but
of
almeria
who
he
says
has
got
all
the
brains
of
the
family
and
ought
to
have
been
the
boy
simon
tried
introducing
ariadne
to
almeria
but
ariadne
fringe
proved
an
insuperable
barrier
as
for
ariadne
almeria
naked
forehead
made
her
feel
quite
shy
she
said
such
a
kind
of
forehead
as
that
needed
covering
i
said
all
the
same
she
was
an
idiot
not
to
make
friends
with
simon
sister
for
he
had
obviously
a
great
respect
for
the
girl
opinion
she
might
have
plenty
of
sense
in
spite
of
her
bald
forehead
and
clumpers
of
boots
but
it
was
no
use
they
stood
glaring
at
each
other
like
two
highland
cattle
while
simon
was
trying
to
invent
a
mutual
bond
between
them
my
sister
writes
a
little
he
said
only
for
nothing
in
the
parish
magazine
said
almeria
witheringly
and
goes
about
he
went
on
with
a
hammer
collecting
bedlamites
and
amorites
said
i
to
make
them
laugh
they
did
laugh
and
simon
continued
and
pebbling
and
mossing
and
growing
sea
anemones
in
basins
then
i
got
excited
and
as
ariadne
stood
mum
i
supported
the
conversation
and
is
it
funny
to
feel
them
claw
your
finger
if
you
put
it
in
their
mouth
well
they
are
all
mouth
are
they
and
stomach
said
almeria
turning
away
politely
ariadne
had
hardly
said
a
word
but
had
left
the
conversation
to
me
but
any
one
could
see
that
these
two
never
could
get
on
ariadne
looked
as
she
stood
on
the
pier
plucking
at
bits
of
hair
that
would
get
loose
just
like
a
pale
butterfly
caught
in
the
rain
while
almeria
stood
as
fast
as
a
capstan
and
as
stumpy
and
the
abominable
thing
was
that
almeria
was
not
in
the
least
rude
she
was
always
civil
perfectly
civil
but
civility
is
the
greatest
preserver
of
distances
there
is
if
people
only
knew
simon
gave
her
up
as
far
as
ariadne
was
concerned
he
stuck
to
ariadne
but
did
not
neglect
other
girls
or
any
one
else
for
her
sake
and
so
compromise
her
he
has
got
a
lot
of
tact
ariadne
has
any
but
she
is
gentle
and
easily
led
and
simon
is
the
kind
of
boy
who
is
going
to
grow
masterful
and
likes
a
girl
who
gives
him
the
chance
of
standing
up
for
her
and
managing
for
her
perhaps
he
is
a
little
bit
sorry
for
her
not
because
she
is
so
dreadfully
in
love
with
him
he
is
conceited
enough
to
see
that
or
ariadne
would
have
shown
him
long
ago
he
is
sorry
for
her
because
she
gives
herself
away
so
in
so
many
ways
looking
pretty
all
the
time
that
is
important
for
it
is
no
good
looking
pathetic
unless
you
look
pretty
as
well
he
chaffs
her
about
her
fluffy
hats
that
go
all
limp
in
the
salt
and
her
pretty
thin
shoes
that
let
the
water
in
and
her
hair
that
never
will
stay
where
she
wants
it
she
has
got
into
the
way
of
continually
arranging
herself
patting
a
bow
here
pulling
her
sleeves
down
over
her
wrist
and
arranging
her
hair
always
at
work
he
says
suddenly
and
ariadne
guilty
hands
go
down
like
clockwork
it
is
rude
the
way
he
says
it
he
looks
at
her
kindly
not
cheekily
it
is
that
kind
sort
of
fatherly
look
that
i
like
and
that
makes
me
think
he
is
fond
of
ariadne
she
is
different
from
lady
scilly
whom
he
is
beginning
slightly
to
detest
sometimes
he
looks
quite
glum
when
she
is
ordering
him
about
but
he
obeys
what
do
married
women
do
to
men
to
make
them
their
slaves
as
they
do
and
yet
one
can
see
by
their
eyes
that
they
do
want
to
and
why
are
the
women
themselves
the
last
to
see
that
the
servant
wants
to
give
notice
and
would
willingly
forfeit
a
month
wages
to
be
allowed
to
leave
at
once
lady
scilly
is
just
like
a
mistress
who
avoids
going
down
into
her
own
kitchen
to
order
dinner
at
a
time
when
relations
are
strained
lest
the
cook
takes
the
chance
of
giving
her
warning
lady
scilly
is
the
least
bit
afraid
of
simon
cooling
off
and
just
now
prefers
to
give
him
his
orders
from
a
distance
she
calls
lord
scilly
and
my
harmless
necessary
husband
he
is
not
dangerous
and
he
certainly
is
useful
for
she
really
could
not
go
about
alone
wearing
the
hats
she
does
she
has
one
made
of
a
whole
parrot
and
a
coat
made
of
leopard
skins
i
like
lord
scilly
he
is
rather
fat
and
knows
it
he
has
a
hoarse
sort
of
voice
and
yet
i
do
think
he
drinks
much
perhaps
it
is
the
life
that
he
leads
among
horses
and
dogs
and
grooms
at
summer
meetings
and
doncaster
and
so
on
he
is
well
known
as
a
fearless
rider
and
risks
his
neck
with
the
greatest
pleasure
if
i
were
lady
scilly
i
should
much
prefer
him
to
george
though
not
to
simon
his
chest
is
broader
than
george
and
he
is
taller
than
simon
but
then
she
is
married
to
either
of
those
marriage
is
like
the
rennet
you
put
into
the
junket
it
turns
it
he
seems
quite
used
to
the
kind
of
wife
he
has
got
he
is
at
all
anxious
to
change
her
he
hardly
ever
talks
about
her
even
to
me
that
is
manners
even
george
has
got
that
sort
of
manners
so
that
half
these
smart
people
do
realize
that
my
father
has
got
a
wife
or
ever
had
one
they
might
if
they
liked
and
after
all
if
mother
does
choose
to
know
his
friends
he
can
not
force
her
she
wo
go
out
with
him
though
she
makes
no
difficulties
about
our
going
she
likes
us
to
go
as
it
opens
our
eyes
and
gives
us
chances
her
business
is
to
see
that
we
are
clean
and
have
nice
hair
not
to
disgrace
him
and
we
do
or
he
would
soon
chuck
us
lord
scilly
always
insists
on
our
being
asked
to
the
picnics
and
parties
they
give
he
likes
us
he
takes
more
notice
of
us
than
she
does
i
think
he
is
a
very
lonely
man
and
quite
glad
of
a
little
notice
and
attention
even
from
a
child
he
is
very
observant
too
i
do
believe
much
goes
past
his
eye
he
thinks
of
everything
from
the
racing
point
of
view
once
when
lady
scilly
and
ariadne
were
both
standing
on
either
side
of
simon
receiving
about
an
equal
share
of
his
attention
or
so
it
seemed
lord
scilly
suddenly
chuckled
and
said
i
back
the
little
he
always
talks
of
and
to
ariadne
as
if
she
were
very
young
indeed
and
it
is
the
surest
way
to
rile
her
she
never
forgave
ptomaine
a
notice
of
hers
on
the
dresses
at
some
private
view
or
other
when
she
alluded
to
ariadne
frock
as
worn
by
a
very
young
girl
lord
scilly
thinks
a
girl
ought
to
be
able
to
stand
chaff
and
is
always
testing
her
ariadne
had
a
birthday
while
we
were
at
whitby
and
it
fell
on
the
day
fixed
for
a
picnic
to
robin
hood
bay
simon
sent
her
a
present
by
the
first
post
in
the
morning
a
fan
that
he
had
written
all
the
way
to
london
for
in
payment
of
some
bet
or
other
he
had
invented
i
suppose
he
did
not
think
it
right
to
give
an
unmarried
girl
a
present
without
some
excuse
like
that
and
of
course
mother
and
aunt
gerty
and
i
gave
her
something
and
even
george
forked
out
a
sovereign
that
was
all
she
expected
and
not
even
that
however
all
the
way
driving
to
the
picnic
lord
scilly
kept
telling
her
that
he
was
going
to
give
her
something
as
well
i
was
sure
he
was
only
teasing
her
for
there
are
no
shops
worth
mentioning
in
robin
bay
so
i
advised
her
to
brace
herself
for
a
disappointment
the
moment
he
got
to
robin
hood
bay
he
was
off
by
himself
and
away
quite
ten
minutes
coming
back
with
a
showy
paper
parcel
at
lunch
he
gave
it
her
with
a
great
deal
of
ceremony
so
that
everybody
was
looking
it
was
worse
than
i
even
had
thought
a
hideous
china
mug
with
a
present
for
a
good
girl
on
it
in
gilt
letters
ariadne
has
it
now
only
the
servants
have
washed
off
the
gilt
lettering
using
soda
as
they
will
the
baby
was
christened
in
it
but
i
am
anticipating
i
had
my
eye
on
her
as
she
untied
the
parcel
hoping
and
wondering
if
she
would
stay
a
lady
in
her
great
disappointment
she
did
she
thanked
him
quite
formally
and
prettily
for
his
charming
present
though
i
saw
her
lip
tremble
a
very
little
i
was
awfully
pleased
with
her
and
so
was
simon
hermyre
for
i
saw
he
particularly
noticed
her
behaviour
as
for
the
scillys
their
nasty
little
joke
fell
rather
flat
in
consequence
of
ariadne
discretion
it
was
a
most
fearfully
hot
day
we
all
sat
on
the
cliff
in
tiers
and
talked
about
the
delightful
golden
weather
which
was
so
oppressive
and
beastly
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
lie
about
and
smoke
so
they
did
the
men
mopped
their
foreheads
when
they
thought
no
one
was
looking
and
the
women
used
slyly
in
their
handkerchiefs
only
ariadne
had
none
to
use
and
kept
cool
by
sheer
force
of
will
i
was
all
right
being
only
a
child
ariadne
was
sitting
a
little
apart
with
me
and
she
was
writing
a
poem
to
the
sea
and
she
told
me
in
a
whisper
as
far
as
she
had
got
the
patient
world
about
their
feet
lay
still
and
weltered
in
the
heat
what
else
could
it
do
but
lie
still
i
said
and
suddenly
just
then
simon
got
up
i
say
i
going
to
take
the
kids
for
a
sail
bring
your
new
mug
missy
and
take
your
tiny
sister
by
the
hand
so
that
she
does
fall
and
break
her
nose
on
the
cliff
steps
after
the
mug
incident
i
do
see
how
anybody
could
have
objected
or
tried
to
prevent
ariadne
from
taking
the
advantages
of
being
treated
as
a
baby
and
i
expect
that
was
what
simon
thought
anyhow
ariadne
got
up
and
went
with
simon
and
me
as
bold
as
any
lion
it
is
a
fact
that
lady
scilly
ca
stand
the
sea
in
small
quantities
like
what
you
get
in
a
boat
though
of
course
she
goes
yachting
cheerfully
none
of
the
others
were
enough
interested
in
simon
to
care
to
move
and
take
any
exercise
in
this
heat
george
gave
her
an
approving
little
nod
as
she
passed
him
we
had
a
lovely
sail
of
a
whole
hour
duration
we
had
an
old
boatman
wearing
his
whiskers
stiffened
with
tallow
who
told
us
he
had
been
a
smuggler
and
treated
ariadne
and
simon
as
if
they
were
an
engaged
couple
out
for
a
spree
with
me
thrown
in
for
a
it
came
on
to
blow
a
little
and
got
much
cooler
ariadne
lost
her
hat
and
had
to
borrow
a
red
silk
handkerchief
of
simon
and
tie
a
knot
in
it
at
all
four
corners
and
wear
it
so
she
looked
most
proud
and
happy
as
if
she
had
on
a
crown
not
a
hat
when
lady
scilly
saw
the
latest
thing
in
hats
she
cried
out
oh
my
poor
ariadne
and
helped
her
to
hide
herself
more
or
less
in
the
waggonette
going
home
i
did
know
before
how
becoming
the
cap
was
chapter
xv
when
george
came
he
took
out
a
family
subscription
to
the
weekly
balls
at
the
saloon
and
we
go
ariadne
and
i
mother
will
not
and
aunt
gerty
may
not
mother
expressly
stipulates
that
she
shall
refrain
from
doing
as
she
wishes
in
this
one
particular
and
as
aunt
gerty
is
guest
she
has
to
please
her
hostess
she
grumbles
a
good
deal
at
george
bearishness
to
her
in
depriving
her
of
any
source
of
amusement
in
this
dull
place
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
is
very
much
taken
up
with
bowser
he
was
ariadne
umbrella
man
the
umbrella
dodge
came
off
with
aunt
gerty
and
this
unpoetical
two
became
fast
friends
on
the
one
rainy
day
bowser
is
a
rich
brewer
and
very
much
mixed
up
with
the
politics
of
this
place
he
owns
three
blocks
of
on
the
front
of
course
simon
hermyre
people
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
him
it
would
be
awkward
if
ariadne
married
simon
and
bowser
had
previously
married
ariadne
legal
aunt
if
aunt
gerty
does
marry
bowser
then
i
do
think
george
would
be
justified
in
cutting
himself
off
from
us
all
to
be
the
of
bowser
would
be
the
ruin
of
him
well
chay
sarah
sarah
as
george
says
sometimes
at
any
rate
we
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
aunt
gerty
trying
to
do
the
best
she
can
for
herself
she
is
awfully
kind
to
us
and
very
loyal
mother
says
and
she
never
gets
a
good
word
from
george
to
make
her
anxious
to
please
mother
gives
her
plenty
of
rope
in
the
bowser
business
on
condition
she
does
try
to
squeeze
herself
into
the
saloon
dancing
set
where
george
friends
go
the
dancing
at
the
saloon
is
very
poor
the
balls
are
only
an
excuse
for
going
out
on
the
parade
and
watching
the
sea
with
a
man
i
like
to
watch
it
best
myself
without
a
man
i
like
to
see
the
whole
dark
sheet
of
water
far
away
and
the
thin
white
line
near
by
that
is
all
there
is
to
tell
one
where
the
little
waves
are
lying
flattened
out
on
the
shore
the
tide
slips
in
so
softly
minding
its
own
business
through
the
long
evening
while
the
idiots
above
galumph
about
and
dance
polkas
in
the
great
hall
inside
with
flags
from
the
crimea
on
the
walls
that
flap
in
the
draught
of
the
north
wind
and
remind
us
constantly
that
we
are
hung
over
the
sea
there
is
a
nice
boy
i
like
he
is
twelve
quite
young
and
does
need
conversing
with
i
simply
take
him
about
with
me
to
prevent
people
meeting
me
and
saying
the
way
they
do
what
child
all
by
yourself
which
is
so
irritating
he
never
interferes
he
trusts
me
he
likes
me
he
is
the
son
of
sir
edward
fynes
of
barsom
and
they
keep
horses
i
might
say
they
eat
horses
and
drink
horses
and
sleep
on
horses
there
ernie
wants
me
to
like
him
so
he
brought
me
a
list
of
his
father
yearlings
with
their
names
and
weights
and
what
they
fetched
at
the
sale
written
out
in
his
own
hand
it
interested
him
so
he
thought
it
would
interest
me
it
must
have
taken
him
hours
to
do
and
when
he
put
it
into
my
hand
and
ran
away
what
amusement
do
you
think
i
could
get
out
of
this
sort
of
thing
witch
ch
f
brooks
guins
milkmaid
wingate
guins
sappho
foal
lord
manham
guins
and
so
on
for
a
page
of
foolscap
rather
an
odd
sort
of
but
i
saw
he
meant
it
and
did
tease
him
ernie
and
i
moon
about
all
the
evening
and
watch
the
others
it
is
not
etiquette
to
interfere
with
a
lady
who
has
her
own
cavalier
and
that
is
why
i
annex
ernie
as
lady
scilly
does
simon
we
do
dance
i
care
to
begin
the
dance
racket
till
i
am
out
and
forced
not
i
nor
do
i
suppose
the
want
a
couple
of
children
getting
into
their
legs
and
throwing
them
down
no
i
watch
them
and
ernie
watches
me
simon
hermyre
and
lady
scilly
dance
half
the
time
together
i
suppose
it
is
and
when
they
are
not
dancing
they
are
talking
of
money
i
have
heard
them
i
do
mind
listening
for
of
course
money
is
private
and
i
think
it
revolting
to
talk
business
on
moonlight
nights
by
the
sea
they
argue
about
bulls
and
bears
and
berthas
which
puzzled
me
at
first
till
ernie
told
me
they
did
not
mean
either
animals
or
women
simon
is
not
at
all
interested
in
any
of
them
ernie
who
is
at
eton
says
it
is
because
he
has
nothing
on
and
only
talks
about
stocks
to
please
her
simon
does
not
talk
about
dirty
money
when
he
is
with
my
sister
he
does
not
talk
much
about
anything
and
yet
they
seem
to
be
enjoying
themselves
perhaps
ariadne
is
a
rest
after
lady
scilly
one
damp
evening
ariadne
and
he
came
out
of
the
big
hall
together
but
before
she
sat
down
in
her
white
dress
on
one
of
the
iron
seats
outside
simon
carefully
wiped
it
with
his
handkerchief
though
it
had
been
raining
then
without
thinking
apparently
he
put
it
up
to
his
own
forehead
phew
i
hot
he
said
it
a
weary
old
world
hope
i
die
soon
simon
talks
broad
yorkshire
i
notice
lady
scilly
had
been
partner
before
ariadne
and
i
had
passed
with
my
boy
that
what
the
women
always
call
their
special
men
just
as
simon
had
taken
out
his
nice
with
his
initials
in
diamonds
that
i
envy
him
so
blow
these
wretched
figures
they
wo
come
i
heard
him
say
on
they
come
fast
enough
not
single
spies
but
in
battalions
lady
scilly
had
answered
pettishly
what
i
complain
of
is
that
they
go
see
if
you
ca
pull
me
through
dear
boy
i
thought
it
indecent
of
her
to
make
poor
simon
do
her
sums
for
her
on
a
heavenly
night
like
this
when
the
tide
is
fully
in
and
all
you
can
see
through
the
white
rails
of
the
esplanade
is
a
soft
creeping
heap
of
dark
water
like
a
pailful
of
ink
simon
now
got
up
and
looked
down
into
it
and
his
forehead
became
one
mass
of
wrinkles
like
a
humphrey
iron
building
and
ariadne
got
up
too
and
looked
into
the
water
with
him
but
she
said
nothing
i
know
her
pretty
well
and
that
it
was
because
she
had
nothing
to
say
and
as
he
evidently
did
want
her
to
say
it
it
did
matter
she
had
put
her
hand
on
the
railing
and
it
looked
very
nice
and
white
in
the
moonlight
somehow
quite
like
a
novel
heroine
so
she
is
repaid
for
her
trouble
and
expense
in
almond
simon
hermyre
looked
at
it
as
i
used
to
stand
and
look
at
a
peach
or
an
apple
on
the
wall
when
i
was
little
he
would
have
liked
to
pick
it
as
i
would
the
apple
or
peach
and
hold
it
tight
in
his
own
hand
i
thought
but
he
did
but
sighed
instead
and
said
i
wish
i
had
a
mother
that
wretched
ernie
boy
began
to
giggle
i
nearly
smothered
him
for
i
wanted
to
hear
what
ariadne
would
say
do
you
she
said
i
have
did
any
one
ever
hear
anything
so
stupid
and
obvious
yet
simon
seemed
to
like
it
for
the
next
thing
he
said
was
why
do
i
know
your
mother
i
expect
she
is
gentle
and
sweet
like
you
i
have
no
doubt
ariadne
would
have
been
imbecile
enough
to
answer
yes
not
seeing
the
pitfall
there
was
hidden
in
the
words
but
at
that
very
moment
george
and
lady
scilly
came
out
with
a
lot
of
other
people
they
came
drifting
along
to
the
balustrade
where
we
were
and
lady
scilly
put
her
hand
on
simon
shoulder
very
lightly
and
george
put
his
heavily
on
ariadne
simon
whisked
away
his
shoulder
and
wriggled
as
much
as
he
dared
ariadne
of
course
could
not
move
at
all
she
said
afterwards
she
felt
as
if
it
was
her
own
and
that
george
was
giving
this
woman
away
quite
naturally
he
likes
to
see
her
with
simon
and
shows
it
it
is
the
only
time
in
his
life
that
he
is
what
they
call
fatherly
lady
scilly
gave
simon
two
taps
i
love
this
thing
you
know
she
said
to
george
then
going
a
little
way
back
just
look
at
them
is
it
idyllic
romeo
and
juliet
spooning
on
a
balcony
over
the
sea
instead
of
over
a
garden
and
with
a
squawking
gull
instead
of
a
nightingale
to
listen
to
and
i
poor
i
am
romeo
deserted
rosaline
did
rosaline
take
on
mercutio
i
wonder
when
she
had
had
enough
of
romeo
she
glared
up
at
george
and
the
moonlight
caught
her
face
the
wrong
way
and
made
her
look
old
all
the
same
she
would
not
have
dared
to
say
all
this
if
she
had
felt
sure
of
simon
and
it
proved
that
he
had
been
silly
enough
to
make
her
think
it
worth
while
to
be
jealous
of
ariadne
i
always
thought
mercutio
by
far
the
most
interesting
character
in
the
piece
come
good
mercutio
romeo
fare
i
mean
flirt
well
they
turned
away
and
left
simon
grinding
his
little
pearly
teeth
i
consider
all
that
in
taste
he
said
whacking
the
rail
with
ariadne
fan
of
course
it
broke
and
ariadne
cried
out
like
a
baby
when
you
have
smashed
its
favourite
toy
simon
was
thoroughly
out
of
temper
with
all
the
world
ariadne
included
lady
scilly
had
called
him
romeo
well
he
was
jealous
of
mercutio
such
is
man
and
boy
he
spoke
quite
crossly
to
ariadne
i
give
you
a
new
one
i
give
you
twenty
new
ones
let
us
go
in
and
dance
dance
like
the
devil
ernie
told
me
a
great
deal
about
lady
scilly
after
they
had
all
gone
in
he
knows
a
lot
about
her
through
his
father
who
has
a
place
near
the
scillys
in
wiltshire
he
says
his
father
says
that
at
this
present
moment
she
has
got
a
cent
to
call
her
own
what
with
gambling
and
betting
she
is
fairly
broke
i
wish
then
she
would
try
to
borrow
money
off
george
just
once
for
that
would
choke
him
off
her
soonest
of
anything
and
then
he
would
perhaps
be
nicer
to
mother
ariadne
would
not
go
to
bed
at
all
that
night
she
sat
in
the
window
eating
dried
raisins
just
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
and
all
the
time
her
affairs
were
progressing
most
favourably
she
was
vexed
because
she
saw
that
lady
scilly
did
not
consider
her
worth
being
jealous
of
i
told
her
she
was
never
nearer
getting
simon
than
now
when
he
was
bringing
a
heart
that
lady
scilly
had
bruised
by
sordid
monetary
considerations
to
her
to
stroke
and
make
well
by
her
soothing
ways
and
ariadne
is
soothing
she
can
do
the
silence
dodge
well
she
is
a
regular
walking
i
tell
her
for
those
that
like
it
simon
was
unusually
nice
to
her
all
the
next
week
just
as
i
prophesied
he
would
be
then
an
untoward
event
happened
there
were
dances
at
the
saloon
only
once
a
week
next
night
a
conjuror
came
to
the
saloon
hall
called
dapping
and
aunt
gerty
took
us
paying
one
shilling
each
for
us
there
were
worse
seats
only
sixpence
but
there
were
also
better
viz
the
first
four
rows
were
three
shillings
the
scilly
party
with
irene
lauderdale
were
in
them
and
on
the
other
side
very
obviously
keeping
themselves
to
themselves
there
was
sir
frederick
hermyre
and
almeria
and
a
severe
woman
aunt
and
simon
in
attendance
the
hermyres
were
staying
all
night
at
the
hotel
and
he
had
to
be
with
them
for
once
waiting
on
his
father
not
on
lady
scilly
it
could
have
been
as
amusing
for
him
as
her
party
that
laughed
and
joked
but
still
simon
as
usual
looked
quite
happy
as
he
was
he
would
have
thought
it
rude
to
look
bored
and
he
did
look
so
nice
and
clean
with
his
little
nose
next
to
his
father
beak
and
almeria
large
of
a
proboscis
framing
them
i
suppose
simon
even
knew
ariadne
and
i
were
there
for
we
were
a
long
way
behind
and
he
does
love
ariadne
enough
yet
to
scent
her
everywhere
next
us
was
bowser
aunt
getty
mash
as
she
calls
him
i
believe
she
had
told
him
we
were
to
be
there
ariadne
and
i
were
disgusted
at
being
mixed
with
bowser
and
tried
to
make
believe
we
were
a
separate
party
and
talked
hard
to
ourselves
all
the
time
ariadne
was
in
a
white
muslin
she
had
made
herself
stuff
from
equality
sale
it
was
pretty
but
casual
she
never
will
have
patience
to
overcast
the
seams
or
settle
which
side
they
are
to
be
on
definitely
she
had
made
her
hat
too
of
chiffon
with
a
great
trail
of
ivy
leaves
over
the
crown
i
wished
she
had
been
dressed
more
soberly
considering
the
company
we
were
in
i
was
attending
very
much
but
presently
i
heard
dapping
with
bowser
who
as
a
leading
citizen
had
gone
on
the
stage
planning
out
a
sort
of
trick
dapping
was
first
blindfolded
and
bowser
was
to
go
into
the
body
of
the
hall
and
pretend
to
murder
some
one
and
dapping
would
tell
him
afterwards
whom
he
had
murdered
dapping
even
went
off
the
platform
so
as
to
be
quite
sure
not
to
see
and
bowser
came
down
the
gangway
in
the
middle
shaking
his
snub
head
about
as
he
selected
a
victim
and
he
had
actually
the
cheek
to
choose
ariadne
he
did
ask
aunt
gerty
or
ariadne
either
if
he
might
take
this
liberty
but
just
seized
ariadne
by
her
thin
muslin
shoulder
and
pretended
to
drive
a
knife
into
her
back
it
all
happened
before
she
had
time
to
stop
him
she
wriggled
but
of
course
they
thought
she
was
acting
up
then
he
sat
down
quite
pleased
with
himself
beside
aunt
gerty
and
dapping
was
released
and
his
eyes
unbandaged
and
he
came
plunging
down
the
gangway
till
he
came
to
our
row
he
was
intensely
excited
and
puffing
like
a
very
disagreeable
to
hear
he
seized
ariadne
by
the
same
shoulder
bowser
had
murdered
her
at
and
shook
her
saying
this
is
the
victim
it
made
ariadne
horribly
common
aunt
gerty
said
afterwards
though
she
might
easily
have
prevented
it
and
told
bowser
to
hit
one
of
his
own
class
anyhow
poor
ariadne
turned
all
the
colours
of
the
rose
and
the
rainbow
and
nearly
cried
for
shame
she
might
as
well
have
been
on
the
stage
for
she
was
just
as
public
all
the
scilly
party
had
of
course
turned
round
and
were
staring
with
all
their
eyes
sir
frederick
and
almeria
never
moved
at
all
poor
simon
did
just
once
and
i
saw
his
scared
disgusted
face
looking
over
his
shoulder
i
had
never
seen
him
look
like
that
before
it
was
awful
the
conjuror
went
calmly
on
to
the
next
trick
but
poor
ariadne
had
been
thoroughly
upset
she
whispered
to
me
i
ca
stand
any
more
of
this
i
believe
i
shall
faint
that
was
true
i
knew
she
ca
faint
if
she
tries
but
still
any
one
could
see
that
she
was
feeling
very
uncomfortable
i
said
to
my
aunt
we
are
going
ariadne
and
i
you
can
stay
behind
if
you
like
and
we
got
up
and
passed
out
amid
a
row
of
sympathetic
that
was
the
worst
of
it
faces
of
course
aunt
gerty
followed
us
out
presently
and
scolded
ariadne
all
the
way
home
for
allowing
herself
to
be
made
a
victim
of
ariadne
never
spoke
till
we
got
in
and
up
in
our
room
then
she
burst
out
crying
he
will
never
speak
to
me
again
i
know
he
wo
he
is
very
proud
and
i
have
disgraced
him
disgraced
him
before
his
order
you
ca
disgrace
that
until
you
are
married
to
him
i
suppose
and
now
you
never
will
be
no
ariadne
said
meekly
i
am
unworthy
of
him
you
are
very
weak
said
i
but
on
the
whole
i
consider
it
was
aunt
gerty
fault
brewing
away
like
that
and
not
attending
to
her
charges
ariadne
cried
and
hocketed
as
the
cook
used
to
say
all
night
and
i
tried
to
comfort
her
and
tell
her
that
simon
would
probably
come
to
call
next
day
to
show
that
and
that
he
did
think
anything
of
it
of
course
when
i
remembered
his
face
i
did
suppose
he
would
ever
care
to
see
a
girl
who
had
been
pummelled
first
by
bowser
and
then
by
dapping
again
all
next
day
ariadne
would
not
go
out
she
said
she
could
not
meet
the
eye
of
whitby
it
rained
luckily
next
day
she
still
would
and
as
it
was
one
of
the
best
days
we
have
had
i
began
to
think
that
she
was
going
too
far
with
her
remorse
and
was
quite
cross
with
her
no
one
ever
remembers
anything
that
happened
to
some
one
else
i
said
and
they
ca
see
that
your
shoulder
is
black
and
blue
under
your
gown
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
publicly
flogged
and
i
had
on
my
white
muslin
too
she
moaned
though
i
do
know
what
she
meant
that
it
had
made
a
more
conspicuous
object
or
was
bad
for
the
dress
or
what
i
know
one
thing
she
gulped
aunt
gerty
or
no
aunt
gerty
i
shall
cut
bowser
next
time
i
see
him
cut
him
dead
why
not
he
murdered
you
i
think
this
was
ariadne
first
sorrow
and
lasted
quite
a
week
she
would
only
go
out
after
dark
to
hide
her
shame
from
every
eye
mother
encouraged
her
and
said
she
knew
how
she
must
feel
to
aunt
gerty
she
said
several
times
never
again
which
is
the
most
awful
thing
to
say
to
any
one
it
meant
that
aunt
gerty
was
to
be
trusted
with
girls
and
especially
george
girls
mother
gave
it
her
well
you
should
have
prevented
ariadne
from
letting
herself
down
like
that
i
shall
never
hear
the
end
of
it
from
george
george
indeed
why
was
george
looking
after
his
own
precious
kids
then
i
do
think
he
got
any
need
to
talk
my
lord
scilly
will
be
having
a
word
with
him
some
of
these
days
or
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
you
hold
your
wicked
lying
tongue
was
all
mother
said
to
her
mother
somehow
has
the
heart
to
be
hard
on
aunt
gerty
i
could
have
told
aunt
gerty
that
lord
scilly
was
keeping
quite
calm
he
can
manage
lady
scilly
well
enough
i
have
heard
him
say
so
paquerette
knows
the
side
her
bread
is
buttered
as
well
as
any
woman
living
she
is
a
right
good
sort
is
paquerette
only
she
likes
to
kick
her
heels
a
bit
she
and
i
understand
each
other
he
talks
like
this
as
if
they
were
like
darby
and
joan
but
lady
scilly
does
agree
with
him
or
says
she
does
scilly
and
i
she
once
said
to
ariadne
are
an
astigmatic
couple
she
meant
she
explained
that
they
are
like
two
eyes
whose
sight
is
different
i
fancy
his
is
the
eye
well
this
little
row
was
soon
over
as
far
as
mother
and
aunt
gerty
were
concerned
george
scolding
was
short
and
sweet
aunt
gerty
said
and
she
could
possibly
dislike
him
more
than
she
did
already
but
ariadne
could
not
get
over
her
disgrace
for
ages
she
still
would
stir
out
of
the
house
but
i
went
out
regularly
and
policed
lady
scilly
and
simon
of
course
this
contretemps
to
ariadne
has
had
the
effect
of
throwing
them
into
each
other
arms
worse
than
ever
they
became
inseparable
if
lady
scilly
had
only
known
it
simon
being
near
her
made
her
look
quite
old
and
anxious
whereas
she
made
him
look
young
and
bored
one
morning
i
stood
and
watched
them
leaning
over
the
wooden
rail
of
the
quay
everybody
leans
there
in
the
mornings
it
fashionable
and
if
you
lean
a
little
forward
or
backward
you
can
either
see
or
not
be
seen
by
the
person
who
is
hanging
over
it
a
few
yards
further
on
the
boats
were
as
usual
unloading
their
big
haul
of
herrings
and
the
sailors
they
have
been
up
all
night
were
sitting
smoking
lazily
on
the
edges
of
the
boats
lady
scilly
was
in
white
linen
so
awfully
pure
and
that
the
little
boys
dabbed
her
with
as
they
passed
her
she
was
talking
to
simon
about
money
earnestly
and
took
no
notice
she
was
telling
him
that
lord
scilly
likes
money
so
much
that
he
did
ever
like
to
let
it
out
of
his
hands
what
business
of
simon
hermyre
is
it
i
should
like
to
know
what
lord
scilly
chooses
to
do
with
his
money
everybody
seems
to
think
simon
is
going
to
be
rich
because
he
is
the
son
of
sir
frederick
hermyre
but
that
is
no
criterion
he
always
seems
to
have
plenty
of
but
i
still
think
it
mean
of
a
woman
to
borrow
money
of
a
boy
do
let
me
have
the
pleasure
he
kept
saying
and
do
let
me
and
goodness
knows
why
for
she
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
to
prevent
him
i
suppose
it
is
why
people
like
simon
so
much
that
he
always
seems
to
be
trying
to
do
what
they
want
in
spite
of
themselves
then
that
is
settled
thank
the
lord
i
heard
him
say
at
last
my
sailor
buffer
between
me
and
her
had
begun
to
talk
to
a
man
below
and
rather
drowned
their
conversation
just
look
at
that
sheet
of
silver
on
the
floor
of
the
boat
all
one
night
haul
suppose
it
was
shillings
and
yes
only
suppose
and
the
sailors
treading
carelessly
about
in
it
as
you
might
in
the
train
of
one
of
my
dresses
it
is
very
like
a
full
is
it
the
one
you
are
going
to
have
the
privilege
of
paying
for
simon
said
yes
it
was
but
he
did
seem
to
like
her
quite
so
much
as
he
did
since
she
gave
in
and
let
him
pay
her
bill
he
seemed
to
have
grown
a
little
bit
older
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
a
sort
of
aged
pinched
look
come
over
his
face
then
i
saw
i
positively
saw
the
thought
of
my
sister
ariadne
come
there
and
make
him
handsome
and
boyish
again
and
i
wriggled
past
my
sailor
and
came
round
behind
her
and
said
how
do
you
do
lady
scilly
having
done
with
simon
for
the
moment
left
him
and
went
to
speak
to
sidney
robinson
and
george
who
had
just
come
up
from
their
bathe
how
is
your
sister
simon
asked
me
very
well
thank
you
at
least
i
mean
not
very
well
i
do
wonder
i
was
so
sorry
for
her
the
other
night
did
you
loathe
her
your
face
looked
as
if
you
did
nothing
of
the
kind
but
if
i
ever
get
a
chance
of
doing
that
brute
bowser
some
injury
i
and
the
people
she
was
with
i
beg
your
pardon
but
that
young
lady
who
was
in
charge
of
you
both
was
it
her
business
to
prevent
miss
being
imposed
upon
he
meant
aunt
gerty
of
course
i
made
up
my
mind
in
a
second
what
was
best
to
do
for
the
best
of
all
oh
person
said
i
she
was
anything
to
do
with
us
miss
gertrude
jenynge
playing
at
the
saloon
theatre
i
believe
i
think
that
your
sister
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
to
places
like
that
alone
why
i
was
with
her
what
earthly
good
are
you
you
small
elf
asked
simon
seriously
and
kindly
smiling
down
at
me
i
wish
to
goodness
sister
i
know
what
he
meant
that
he
wished
he
could
persuade
almeria
to
take
to
ariadne
and
boss
her
about
but
he
did
say
it
he
is
so
prim
and
reserved
about
his
family
he
simply
asked
to
be
remembered
to
ariadne
and
that
he
was
going
to
stay
with
some
people
at
a
place
called
henderland
in
northumberland
henderland
said
i
that
near
where
christina
lives
who
is
christina
why
george
old
secretary
she
is
a
ball
now
you
were
her
best
man
peter
ball
good
old
ball
so
i
was
bless
me
you
forgotten
love
so
soon
church
june
yes
of
course
i
used
to
call
her
the
woman
who
would
marry
the
good
ball
i
mean
i
shall
be
over
there
some
time
next
month
shooting
she
gave
me
a
general
invitation
he
would
say
when
he
was
likely
to
be
at
rattenraw
it
is
a
little
way
men
have
of
defending
themselves
against
girls
like
ariadne
now
ariadne
and
i
had
a
particular
invitation
to
go
and
stay
with
christina
for
a
fortnight
as
it
happened
and
if
ariadne
had
been
having
this
talk
instead
of
me
she
would
have
told
him
and
tried
to
pin
him
down
to
a
time
but
i
was
wiser
i
said
quite
shortly
as
if
i
was
at
all
interested
in
his
movements
and
went
home
i
was
a
little
ashamed
of
one
thing
i
had
told
a
lie
about
aunt
gerty
and
denied
her
before
men
as
the
scripture
says
but
it
was
not
for
my
own
sake
fifty
aunt
gertys
ca
hurt
me
but
one
can
do
ariadne
lots
of
harm
and
ruin
her
social
prestige
on
the
way
home
i
thought
what
i
would
do
and
did
it
at
lunch
please
aunt
gerty
i
said
if
you
meet
me
on
the
quays
or
anywhere
when
i
am
talking
to
simon
hermyre
i
must
beg
of
you
not
to
be
familiar
with
me
for
i
have
told
him
that
you
were
no
relation
and
i
gave
him
your
stage
name
when
he
asked
me
who
you
were
oh
did
he
ask
said
aunt
gerty
jumping
about
he
must
have
seen
me
somewhere
in
perhaps
i
made
a
hit
there
well
child
you
may
as
well
bring
us
together
use
my
professional
name
of
course
all
right
said
i
did
not
tell
her
simon
was
off
now
do
you
call
that
eating
your
cake
and
having
it
chapter
xvi
we
all
hoped
that
bowser
would
find
he
liked
aunt
gerty
well
enough
to
wish
to
relieve
us
of
her
but
we
evidently
wished
it
so
strongly
that
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
obliging
us
these
things
get
into
the
air
somehow
and
put
people
off
of
course
aunt
gerty
herself
wished
it
more
than
anybody
and
she
was
feeling
considerably
annoyed
as
she
completed
the
arrangements
for
a
rather
seedy
sort
of
autumn
tour
which
she
would
not
have
had
to
do
if
she
could
have
pulled
it
off
with
the
brewer
she
wreaked
her
vexation
on
us
us
and
mother
who
was
very
patient
knowing
what
poor
aunt
gerty
was
feeling
but
ariadne
who
was
feeling
very
much
the
same
way
and
had
to
suffer
in
silence
resented
it
and
when
aunt
gerty
hustled
her
hustled
back
in
spite
of
her
broken
heart
george
left
for
scotland
he
he
is
going
to
shoot
with
the
scillys
i
do
know
why
but
i
have
a
fancy
he
has
gone
to
ben
rhydding
all
alone
to
cure
his
gout
it
did
matter
it
was
settled
that
we
were
to
go
to
stay
with
christina
in
northumberland
ariadne
did
like
going
straight
on
from
whitby
because
she
would
have
preferred
to
get
her
country
outfit
in
london
but
of
course
the
difference
on
fares
made
that
impossible
it
is
one
of
the
curious
things
about
finance
that
george
should
make
so
much
money
and
we
should
still
have
to
think
of
a
beggarly
three
hundred
miles
or
so
at
a
penny
a
mile
that
is
what
it
costs
as
of
course
we
go
the
conservatory
at
cinque
cento
house
costs
george
three
hundred
a
year
alone
to
keep
up
and
the
hall
of
arms
as
it
is
written
up
over
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
house
must
be
done
up
every
few
months
it
is
all
white
five
coats
to
set
off
george
black
velvet
fencing
costume
and
his
neat
legs
george
has
much
taste
he
simply
lives
at
christie
he
can
not
help
buying
cabinets
and
chairs
at
a
few
hundred
pounds
apiece
he
says
they
are
realizable
property
ariadne
and
i
would
like
to
realize
them
the
great
point
with
ariadne
was
how
to
dress
suitably
for
christina
i
said
same
as
london
only
shorter
and
plainer
ariadne
hankered
after
a
proper
shooting
toilette
she
had
the
sovereign
george
gave
her
for
her
birthday
and
two
pounds
she
had
made
by
a
poem
and
another
mother
gave
her
she
looks
much
best
dressed
quietly
nothing
mannish
or
exact
suits
her
for
it
at
once
brings
out
the
of
her
face
which
is
of
the
type
she
has
grown
to
that
being
trained
up
in
it
from
her
earliest
years
all
types
can
be
acquired
in
the
face
of
this
she
went
out
and
bought
a
home
and
selected
a
pattern
of
stylish
dress
for
the
moors
and
got
a
cheap
tailor
in
the
town
to
make
it
up
for
her
ye
gods
as
aunt
gerty
says
i
used
to
go
with
her
to
be
fitted
it
was
a
business
they
took
her
in
and
let
her
out
kneeling
about
her
with
their
mouths
full
of
pins
so
that
you
could
scold
them
lest
you
gave
them
a
shock
and
drove
all
the
pins
down
their
throat
and
the
little
tailor
kept
saying
a
pleat
here
would
be
beneficial
to
it
madam
or
to
his
assistant
remove
that
fulness
there
till
there
was
a
straight
seam
left
in
it
it
was
all
bias
and
bulge
ariadne
cried
over
the
way
that
skirt
hung
for
an
hour
when
it
came
home
too
much
of
bias
hast
thou
poor
ariadne
i
said
to
her
imitating
the
pompous
tailor
but
although
i
chaffed
her
i
went
to
him
and
made
him
take
ten
shillings
off
the
bill
i
could
help
thinking
of
a
real
country
girl
like
almeria
hermyre
when
ariadne
put
this
confection
on
for
the
first
time
in
the
privateness
of
our
bedroom
it
was
brown
tweed
turned
up
with
real
cow
as
ben
said
there
is
even
a
piece
of
leather
stitched
on
to
her
shoulder
where
she
is
to
rest
her
gun
ariadne
who
once
pulled
one
leg
that
i
daresay
he
could
easily
spare
off
a
and
considered
herself
little
better
than
a
murderer
ben
who
was
present
at
this
private
view
did
not
like
her
in
it
and
told
her
so
he
is
so
truthful
that
he
never
waits
to
be
asked
his
opinion
so
long
as
he
did
tease
her
about
simon
hermyre
it
did
not
matter
but
he
is
quite
a
gentleman
though
rough
indeed
nobody
mentioned
simon
though
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
him
a
good
deal
in
connection
with
ariadne
new
dress
i
was
sure
we
should
see
him
somewhere
in
northumberland
it
is
as
big
as
america
and
where
there
is
even
a
faint
will
there
is
generally
a
way
ariadne
was
thinking
of
him
when
she
bought
a
billycock
hat
on
purpose
to
stick
in
a
wing
simon
had
once
given
her
that
he
had
shot
i
did
not
interfere
for
i
thought
if
he
saw
her
in
it
he
might
think
some
other
fellow
had
given
her
a
moorcock
feather
there
are
plenty
of
them
about
and
plenty
of
fools
to
shoot
them
i
myself
did
not
make
much
preparation
just
a
new
elastic
to
my
hat
and
new
laces
to
my
boots
how
delightful
it
is
to
care
for
no
man
how
it
simplifies
life
all
this
bother
about
ariadne
has
choked
me
off
love
for
a
long
while
to
come
i
do
care
if
it
never
comes
my
way
at
all
but
i
am
only
fourteen
and
have
not
got
the
place
in
my
head
ready
for
it
yet
anyway
i
do
believe
that
love
is
a
woman
whole
existence
any
more
than
it
is
a
man
we
are
like
ships
made
in
compartments
so
that
if
something
goes
wrong
with
one
compartment
the
whole
concern
is
done
for
until
i
am
old
enough
to
set
a
whole
compartment
aside
for
love
i
can
be
easy
and
watch
the
others
wallowing
life
is
one
huge
party
to
me
and
the
girls
who
are
not
out
yet
watching
it
through
the
bannisters
and
getting
a
taste
of
the
ices
now
and
then
i
do
study
dinners
at
home
we
have
never
given
one
in
cinque
cento
house
george
entertains
a
good
deal
at
the
club
when
he
can
get
lady
scilly
or
some
one
like
that
to
play
hostess
and
give
the
signal
to
rise
for
him
a
thing
somehow
that
no
man
ever
seems
capable
of
doing
for
himself
mother
and
aunt
gerty
saw
us
off
for
morpeth
at
whitby
station
aunt
gerty
looked
far
more
excited
than
just
seeing
a
couple
of
nieces
off
could
make
her
and
i
soon
saw
the
reason
of
it
bowser
was
leaving
by
the
same
train
he
went
of
course
which
was
annoying
for
aunt
gerty
as
that
made
him
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
train
too
far
off
to
see
how
prettily
she
kissed
her
nieces
and
bought
them
and
chocolate
creams
we
got
the
creams
anyhow
children
often
profit
by
their
elders
foolish
fancies
mother
would
even
let
us
kiss
her
out
of
the
for
fear
the
train
started
and
we
got
dragged
out
and
sure
enough
we
did
go
on
suddenly
in
that
slidy
masterful
way
trains
have
i
have
a
particular
affinity
to
trains
my
built
an
engine
and
had
it
called
after
him
when
he
was
dying
he
was
taken
in
his
chair
to
where
the
great
northern
trains
pass
every
day
and
drew
his
last
breath
as
the
scotch
express
rattled
by
to
return
i
noticed
that
aunt
gerty
looked
awfully
pleased
about
something
and
kept
sticking
her
hip
out
in
an
engaging
way
she
has
and
i
concluded
that
bowser
had
at
last
spotted
her
and
thrown
her
an
encouraging
nod
perhaps
blown
her
a
kiss
only
he
is
perhaps
not
quite
low
enough
for
that
but
whatever
it
was
it
made
her
happy
oh
if
they
only
could
all
get
the
man
they
want
the
they
want
him
what
a
nice
place
the
world
would
be
for
children
at
any
rate
all
people
tempers
come
because
they
ca
get
what
they
want
and
here
was
i
boxed
up
with
one
who
had
got
what
she
wanted
for
a
whole
blessed
day
she
was
simply
weltering
in
love
if
i
may
say
so
she
had
a
penny
ready
to
write
poetry
in
and
meant
to
dream
and
write
and
cry
for
four
hours
i
had
a
nice
improper
of
my
aunt
gerty
but
i
scarcely
hoped
that
ariadne
would
allow
me
to
enjoy
it
of
course
not
she
soon
began
bothering
as
soon
as
we
were
properly
started
she
pulled
up
her
thousand
times
too
thick
veil
badly
put
on
ariadne
is
too
simple
ever
to
learn
to
put
on
a
veil
properly
as
other
women
do
and
looked
hard
at
herself
in
her
pocket
and
sighed
and
settled
her
loose
tendril
and
unsettled
it
and
pinched
her
cheek
to
massage
it
and
restore
the
subcutaneous
deposit
the
doctor
had
told
her
about
she
seemed
hopeless
and
sad
for
presently
she
said
no
i
am
not
looking
beautiful
a
pretty
white
tear
like
a
pearl
button
shook
on
her
eyelashes
and
i
wondered
how
long
she
could
keep
it
hanging
there
i
do
believe
she
was
anxious
to
look
nice
because
she
had
an
idea
she
might
see
simon
at
morpeth
but
one
never
does
see
people
at
stations
and
personally
i
think
that
ariadne
would
be
far
prettier
if
she
did
know
she
was
pretty
it
is
most
unkind
and
inconsiderate
of
her
friends
to
keep
telling
her
so
it
is
just
like
our
horrid
lot
in
simon
set
they
would
die
sooner
than
pay
a
girl
a
compliment
to
her
face
but
she
has
got
so
hardened
to
it
that
i
always
have
to
take
her
down
gently
so
as
not
to
hurt
her
same
as
one
does
with
invalids
it
does
matter
how
you
look
i
said
there
is
nobody
but
porters
to
see
you
and
you
do
want
to
mash
them
and
distract
them
from
their
work
and
make
them
get
the
points
all
wrong
i
should
have
thought
you
preferred
being
alone
you
can
write
in
your
book
let
us
do
dodge
and
stand
at
the
window
whenever
we
come
into
a
station
and
look
as
repulsive
as
we
can
george
likes
to
keep
the
carriage
all
to
himself
and
taught
us
what
to
do
to
secure
it
the
only
time
he
ever
travelled
with
us
we
made
a
prominent
object
of
ben
very
sticky
with
lollipops
and
managed
to
be
by
ourselves
all
the
way
ariadne
was
unwilling
to
do
this
now
she
sat
still
in
her
corner
and
brooded
and
that
did
just
as
well
for
the
passengers
looked
in
and
saw
her
and
made
up
their
minds
that
she
was
recovering
from
scarlet
fever
or
at
least
measles
i
stood
in
the
window
squarely
and
looked
ugly
for
two
i
was
interested
in
the
country
it
is
quite
hideous
between
whitby
and
morpeth
the
reason
is
that
it
is
an
industrial
centre
i
began
to
wish
that
our
eating
kitchen
boilers
and
keeping
warm
coal
did
mean
so
many
people
having
to
live
black
and
whole
counties
in
a
blanket
of
smoke
i
do
think
i
approve
of
civilization
if
this
is
what
it
comes
out
of
when
the
train
slowed
down
at
morpeth
i
could
not
help
calling
out
to
ariadne
i
told
you
so
for
there
was
christina
ball
in
a
muslin
dress
with
a
soft
floppy
chiffon
hat
and
no
veil
at
all
she
was
sitting
in
a
little
with
an
ugly
child
that
could
be
hers
we
saw
her
from
the
train
it
was
a
shock
to
ariadne
and
she
was
wild
to
get
our
box
into
the
first
and
unlock
it
and
get
out
one
of
her
old
dresses
but
how
could
she
dress
in
the
and
besides
she
would
be
certain
to
muddle
the
next
thing
i
told
her
and
so
she
did
we
got
out
of
the
station
and
into
the
trap
christina
had
a
new
pony
and
could
get
down
and
it
was
arranged
that
our
luggage
was
to
come
on
by
carrier
as
our
wicker
trunk
would
be
sure
to
scratch
the
smart
new
off
we
went
i
thought
and
i
am
sure
ariadne
thought
a
little
too
like
the
wind
but
ariadne
wanted
to
appear
at
ease
and
casual
and
countrified
so
she
pretended
to
take
an
interest
in
the
scenery
and
said
to
christina
look
at
the
lovely
tone
of
that
verdigris
on
the
pond
the
ugly
child
twitched
her
feet
under
the
rug
beside
me
she
said
nothing
but
looked
it
oh
the
said
christina
who
knows
ariadne
too
well
to
be
amused
by
anything
she
says
miss
emerson
tree
here
allow
me
to
introduce
peter
american
niece
miss
jane
emerson
tree
calls
it
the
the
ugly
child
still
did
say
anything
though
stagnance
was
just
as
absurd
a
word
for
mildew
on
a
pond
as
verdigris
and
i
began
to
be
quite
afraid
of
one
who
though
so
young
did
seem
to
want
to
fly
out
she
turned
half
round
though
and
seemed
to
be
staring
hard
at
the
body
of
ariadne
shooting
dress
with
its
patch
on
the
left
shoulder
christina
went
on
enlightening
us
about
the
country
and
telling
us
the
sort
of
things
we
were
likely
to
ask
and
make
fools
of
ourselves
about
i
do
believe
she
was
afraid
of
our
saying
something
specially
silly
before
jane
emerson
tree
and
wanted
to
save
us
from
ourselves
it
came
at
last
and
ariadne
nearly
toppled
out
of
the
cart
the
ugly
child
spoke
in
the
most
strong
american
accent
and
the
way
she
leant
upon
the
last
syllable
of
the
word
was
the
nastiest
thing
i
ever
heard
oh
i
do
just
your
waist
she
said
to
ariadne
i
been
looking
at
it
all
the
way
we
come
christina
absently
took
hold
of
her
whip
and
then
rattled
it
back
in
its
socket
she
then
scolded
jane
till
i
should
have
thought
any
ordinary
child
could
have
gone
on
sitting
up
but
this
one
did
never
saying
a
word
but
pursed
her
mouth
in
till
there
was
hardly
a
line
to
be
seen
then
christina
began
to
tell
us
how
dull
she
had
found
it
living
in
the
country
and
how
difficult
to
get
acclimatized
at
first
but
in
the
end
the
country
rubs
off
on
one
she
sighed
and
a
good
thing
too
oh
the
mistakes
i
made
at
first
you
know
that
peter
and
i
have
both
been
staying
with
the
dear
bishop
of
guyzance
oh
christina
you
changed
said
i
i
know
dear
three
services
on
sunday
and
a
shilling
for
the
offertory
so
different
from
newton
hall
and
farm
street
as
i
was
saying
i
came
back
from
lale
castle
the
day
before
yesterday
post
haste
to
hatch
some
chickens
i
thought
a
hen
did
that
ventured
ariadne
right
you
are
i
pretended
to
peter
that
it
was
an
insane
desire
to
kiss
the
baby
but
i
was
an
hour
in
the
house
before
i
even
thought
of
the
child
the
hen
was
due
to
hatch
fifteen
i
interviewed
her
every
hour
much
to
her
disgust
at
last
crack
one
came
out
you
mean
chipped
the
shell
said
ariadne
primly
right
again
i
put
it
in
a
basket
by
the
kitchen
fire
the
servants
shunted
it
for
dinner
it
got
cold
it
died
in
the
night
yesterday
five
more
happened
i
popped
them
in
the
mild
oven
for
a
minute
just
then
some
one
pinched
my
baby
he
screamed
and
went
on
screaming
like
an
gone
wrong
i
had
to
go
and
look
after
him
cook
made
a
blazing
fire
do
you
see
i
have
only
saved
five
out
of
that
brood
how
very
funny
said
ariadne
who
was
a
bit
amused
i
was
christina
told
us
of
a
little
hen
peter
had
before
who
had
been
used
to
be
set
to
ducks
and
who
had
learned
to
march
them
all
down
to
the
nearest
pond
the
first
lot
of
chickens
had
been
driven
to
a
watery
and
unfamiliar
death
would
you
like
to
go
and
be
photographed
she
asked
ariadne
and
ariadne
was
on
the
at
once
they
all
think
one
an
unnatural
parent
here
if
one
does
take
one
brood
to
be
perpetuated
at
oldfort
every
year
but
the
trains
there
are
so
awkward
for
us
i
am
fighting
the
railway
authorities
tooth
and
nail
trying
to
persuade
them
to
put
on
a
slip
carriage
they
do
it
for
keiller
and
his
marmalade
so
why
not
for
me
say
i
am
on
the
pony
neck
i
am
going
to
put
the
seat
back
take
the
reins
a
minute
ariadne
did
of
course
like
her
giving
them
to
me
but
everybody
always
sees
at
once
that
i
am
the
practical
one
when
the
seat
was
arranged
she
went
bubbling
on
next
week
is
our
harvest
festival
and
school
feast
and
ball
in
the
the
gaieties
of
this
parish
i
have
had
tea
with
myself
for
a
whole
week
i
am
a
very
hard
worker
you
do
know
peter
says
i
lie
awake
at
nights
thinking
of
stodgy
moral
books
to
recommend
for
the
village
library
i
recommend
some
not
all
of
my
late
patron
your
father
works
the
vicar
here
is
a
dear
old
dodderer
and
was
so
shocked
when
i
recommended
him
road
to
it
a
book
of
travel
you
know
we
have
a
young
man
here
too
quite
an
eligible
he
told
me
so
he
is
so
shy
you
see
he
says
the
wrong
thing
i
wonder
whether
you
make
anything
of
him
to
a
flirt
all
things
are
possible
i
am
not
a
flirt
now
said
ariadne
she
was
nearly
giving
the
whole
thing
away
only
the
pony
bolted
at
least
christina
said
it
was
an
attempt
at
bolting
my
god
pony
she
said
to
it
and
it
stopped
shocked
at
her
swearing
i
suppose
and
there
simon
hermyre
in
the
neighbourhood
henderland
is
not
more
than
ten
miles
off
ariadne
at
once
sat
tight
too
tight
it
was
almost
painful
and
showed
in
her
face
too
just
as
we
were
driving
in
at
the
gate
of
rattenraw
jane
emerson
tree
spoke
again
and
actually
about
ariadne
body
any
way
it
on
all
crooked
she
said
as
if
she
was
continuing
the
previous
discussion
peter
came
out
to
meet
us
and
she
was
lifted
down
they
could
i
suppose
leave
her
sitting
and
just
put
her
away
in
the
all
night
that
is
what
i
should
have
done
and
cooled
her
hot
blood
but
i
saw
how
it
was
when
we
got
in
and
were
having
tea
she
had
hers
laced
i
mean
brandy
in
it
peter
is
awfully
proud
of
her
and
thinks
she
will
be
a
great
actress
and
astonish
the
world
some
day
she
certainly
mimicked
peter
to
his
face
i
will
let
her
know
if
i
catch
her
mimicking
ariadne
peter
enjoyed
it
the
moment
a
child
is
really
rude
people
think
it
is
going
to
do
great
things
i
have
noticed
that
now
i
would
no
sooner
think
of
criticizing
a
person
things
to
her
face
as
i
would
of
kissing
emerson
tree
very
ugly
mug
though
i
would
tell
her
so
otherwise
than
by
my
reluctance
to
embrace
her
peter
calls
her
the
little
witch
the
little
witch
he
says
was
being
neglected
or
thought
she
was
at
lunch
the
other
day
and
in
a
trice
she
called
out
to
the
butler
say
holmes
old
man
look
alive
with
those
potatoes
will
you
you
should
have
seen
the
old
boy
face
i
did
see
the
old
boy
face
he
was
waiting
at
tea
christina
told
us
stories
about
her
all
she
listened
quietly
as
she
munched
buns
how
when
she
saw
the
new
baby
she
said
dash
it
all
why
it
bald
how
one
rainy
day
she
was
lost
and
they
found
her
with
six
of
her
village
friends
walking
in
a
straight
line
down
to
the
pond
barefooted
and
bareheaded
and
their
mouths
open
quacking
and
to
catch
the
like
ducks
do
how
she
has
done
all
the
absurd
things
children
do
in
books
such
as
aspinalling
the
cat
as
if
a
cat
ever
stayed
to
be
aspinalled
and
gunpowder
into
ovens
and
frogs
into
boots
and
hedgehogs
into
beds
she
says
so
but
i
believe
she
put
the
and
peter
mistook
it
with
his
feet
in
the
dark
and
once
when
a
noted
socialist
man
had
been
staying
there
and
rashly
talked
before
her
she
had
given
away
the
furniture
she
went
solemnly
down
the
village
said
christina
making
presents
of
the
unearned
increment
in
the
shape
of
things
she
did
want
and
i
did
missing
tensions
of
and
valves
of
cycles
and
stray
and
other
bits
of
rolling
stock
all
disappeared
when
it
came
to
the
spare
and
my
best
silver
scissors
however
i
had
to
scold
her
oh
she
be
a
great
actress
some
day
we
listened
and
i
am
sure
no
one
could
tell
from
my
face
how
i
disapproved
of
it
all
unless
duse
the
second
who
after
all
was
a
child
too
twigged
how
ridiculous
they
were
making
her
look
anyhow
after
she
had
made
three
usual
scenes
and
one
extraordinary
one
because
we
were
there
and
had
been
noisily
taken
off
to
bed
they
left
off
discussing
her
and
took
up
a
perfectly
safe
subject
shoots
and
who
to
have
christina
teases
she
always
did
even
in
the
days
when
she
used
to
put
us
head
first
down
has
he
a
wife
she
asks
whenever
peter
proposes
a
man
my
dear
i
have
the
slightest
idea
all
i
know
is
he
is
a
capital
shot
and
brings
down
his
pheasants
in
good
style
these
good
shots
bring
down
such
bad
wives
i
mean
from
the
point
of
view
she
says
to
look
at
their
choice
they
would
always
seem
to
have
fired
recklessly
into
the
brown
and
got
pot
luck
you
see
i
am
boxed
up
with
your
friends
bad
shots
all
day
i
ca
possibly
make
my
housewifely
duties
last
all
the
morning
and
i
object
to
have
jane
brought
down
in
her
best
frock
and
her
worst
behaviour
to
make
sport
for
idle
women
and
she
hates
ladies
and
has
the
wit
to
come
in
with
segments
of
the
wanny
crag
on
her
boots
and
her
hair
full
of
straws
so
as
to
be
sent
out
of
the
to
herself
up
i
do
like
that
phrase
christina
do
be
so
aggressively
pure
peter
ariadne
and
i
have
called
him
pure
peter
ever
since
but
he
is
not
bad
really
it
is
a
mercy
when
one
friends
show
a
little
consideration
in
their
marriage
and
one
must
be
too
particular
for
the
world
is
full
of
bounders
one
might
have
got
and
had
to
be
civil
to
peter
ball
talks
about
vickings
and
keeps
a
chart
of
the
weather
but
except
for
fussy
ways
like
that
he
is
quite
a
gentleman
chapter
xvii
ariadne
got
fatter
at
rattenraw
which
is
humiliating
enough
to
a
girl
in
her
position
i
ca
say
that
she
kept
that
up
at
all
well
beyond
looking
sad
sometimes
when
she
was
thinking
or
at
meals
she
has
to
pretend
to
be
for
really
she
is
very
all
there
and
likes
her
dinner
peter
ball
carving
the
roast
red
beef
holds
his
knife
up
in
the
air
to
tease
her
and
says
to
her
when
she
wo
answer
his
question
whether
she
wants
some
more
thinking
of
the
old
what
he
does
know
how
near
the
truth
he
is
except
in
age
he
knows
nothing
of
ariadne
affairs
he
prefers
not
to
know
but
takes
her
word
for
it
that
she
has
a
secret
sorrow
connected
with
a
member
of
his
sex
jane
emerson
tree
does
take
any
notice
of
ariadne
or
of
me
either
she
is
put
out
at
not
being
allowed
to
say
rude
things
about
us
she
is
a
american
citizen
christina
has
made
ariadne
rip
the
leather
patch
off
the
shoulder
of
the
waist
jane
emerson
objected
to
and
has
lent
her
a
common
straw
sailor
hat
which
suits
her
better
than
the
billycock
a
sailor
hat
you
see
is
a
hat
it
is
a
tile
and
so
ca
either
become
or
unbecome
simon
hermyre
might
have
been
at
henderland
or
at
lord
manham
or
at
barsom
sir
edward
fynes
place
neither
places
are
more
than
ten
miles
or
so
off
but
he
made
no
sign
nor
did
he
answer
a
letter
christina
wrote
to
him
so
ariadne
was
practically
forced
to
flirt
with
the
only
other
man
of
her
own
rank
in
the
village
besides
peter
he
is
the
squire
of
rattenraw
and
lives
in
the
old
hall
and
plays
the
fiddle
and
keeps
only
one
servant
yet
he
came
in
before
the
conquest
that
is
what
becomes
of
all
our
old
families
he
is
old
but
very
wrinkled
that
comes
of
so
frequently
meeting
the
wind
and
exposure
his
corduroy
velvet
coat
and
his
skin
are
much
of
a
muchness
he
is
shy
and
wild
as
peter
remarked
of
the
grouse
this
year
as
i
said
he
is
all
there
is
here
till
christina
shoots
come
off
and
ariadne
egged
him
on
the
amount
of
egging
on
a
shy
man
takes
to
ask
her
and
then
accepted
to
go
out
fishing
with
him
she
sat
all
the
afternoon
on
a
bank
near
by
in
a
biting
wind
straight
down
from
the
wanny
crags
that
blew
the
egg
off
the
sandwiches
and
the
froth
off
the
he
asked
her
if
she
felt
chilly
chilly
she
thought
about
sixteen
times
and
said
by
gosh
when
he
did
catch
anything
which
was
frequent
and
what
in
thunder
got
alluding
to
the
trout
when
at
last
in
despair
they
packed
up
to
go
home
ariadne
got
back
to
tea
chilled
to
the
bone
and
disappointed
at
the
heart
to
find
him
so
coarse
without
being
interesting
she
thinks
all
local
farmers
and
squires
ought
to
be
like
heathcliff
in
and
hide
a
burning
lava
of
passion
under
their
upper
crust
of
cold
indifference
squire
rochester
is
good
and
dull
he
does
admire
ariadne
i
daresay
though
i
am
not
up
in
the
country
signs
of
love
and
it
seems
the
least
he
could
do
for
a
real
london
beauty
who
is
good
enough
to
sit
on
a
sticky
and
muddy
bank
bald
of
grass
and
full
of
and
some
of
them
protruding
disgustingly
as
she
said
for
a
whole
afternoon
watching
him
not
catching
fish
he
leaves
vegetable
marrows
and
nosegays
as
big
as
cabbages
for
the
ladies
at
the
because
he
is
so
shy
he
squeezes
all
christina
rings
into
her
hands
whenever
he
meets
her
but
these
are
as
much
signs
of
love
for
christina
as
for
ariadne
and
peter
ball
says
ariadne
must
take
care
and
not
to
be
like
miss
baxter
whoever
she
was
who
refused
a
gent
before
he
asked
her
christina
thinks
he
a
bit
attracted
and
that
it
is
a
good
thing
for
ariadne
to
have
a
man
to
play
with
in
her
forlorn
condition
and
that
whatever
the
squire
gets
even
a
hopeless
passion
that
he
will
be
able
to
get
over
it
she
considers
that
men
have
a
thicker
sort
of
skin
than
women
and
if
they
are
unhappy
can
turn
up
their
and
get
very
hot
and
throw
it
off
the
squire
keeps
lots
of
cattle
and
is
by
way
of
being
butcher
to
the
village
christina
buys
a
whole
sheep
of
him
sometimes
he
has
plenty
of
distractions
and
she
always
takes
the
side
of
the
woman
de
i
think
they
call
it
i
myself
think
there
should
be
the
same
law
for
men
as
for
women
and
i
have
a
great
mind
to
tell
the
squire
to
save
his
nosegays
for
ariadne
is
in
love
with
simon
i
even
threatened
her
with
this
and
she
turned
round
on
me
and
said
i
should
be
a
liar
for
she
in
love
with
simon
then
i
said
she
might
as
well
leave
off
taking
the
biggest
half
of
the
bed
at
night
and
all
the
in
the
morning
and
first
go
at
the
bath
and
other
special
privileges
she
has
sneaked
because
she
is
supposed
to
be
unhappy
i
am
willing
to
make
every
allowance
for
one
so
persecuted
by
fate
but
not
for
a
woman
who
enjoys
all
the
usual
pleasures
of
her
age
and
sex
as
if
nothing
was
the
matter
then
she
cried
and
said
i
was
unkind
that
she
wanted
all
the
comfort
she
could
get
and
went
off
fishing
with
the
squire
to
spite
me
that
very
afternoon
what
can
one
do
with
a
weathercock
like
that
then
church
decorating
came
on
and
ariadne
could
do
without
the
squire
we
worked
all
day
and
in
the
evening
we
doctored
our
cuts
and
the
places
where
the
lord
had
let
us
get
bruised
and
scratched
in
smartening
up
his
church
for
his
harvest
festival
ariadne
had
a
big
brown
bruise
done
by
a
jagged
pew
on
her
upper
leg
shaped
like
a
tortoise
and
so
we
called
it
so
to
be
able
to
allude
to
it
at
all
times
and
seasons
at
lunch
christina
used
to
ask
ariadne
how
her
tortoise
was
and
ariadne
answered
demurely
that
it
was
getting
a
nice
or
a
good
strong
blue
till
peter
and
the
squire
were
so
much
puzzled
that
they
teased
ariadne
till
she
let
it
out
and
then
peter
teased
her
worse
than
ever
two
local
ladies
hindered
us
at
decoration
and
we
could
not
get
rid
of
them
as
they
had
pulled
their
gardens
about
to
give
us
flowers
but
we
had
to
make
a
rule
that
we
would
allow
gentlemen
in
the
church
during
decorations
it
upset
miss
weeks
so
that
she
hammered
her
fingers
instead
of
the
nails
and
put
flowers
into
the
men
instead
of
threading
them
into
the
in
fits
of
absence
miss
day
the
other
young
lady
agreed
with
christina
that
one
must
really
keep
a
firm
hand
on
miss
weeks
and
that
she
herself
did
care
for
so
many
about
talking
their
nonsense
and
interfering
with
steady
work
but
she
was
sorry
her
sailor
cousin
had
just
come
home
and
she
could
not
spare
more
than
every
other
day
away
from
him
we
were
only
decorating
for
three
days
during
the
she
did
come
however
she
and
miss
weeks
got
on
very
badly
finding
they
could
not
work
together
and
they
had
it
out
in
the
middle
aisle
every
five
minutes
or
so
christina
and
ariadne
had
taken
the
chancel
while
these
two
were
responsible
for
the
font
so
we
did
not
get
mixed
up
so
very
much
but
when
miss
weeks
boxed
miss
ears
with
a
scarborough
lily
and
miss
day
retorted
with
a
double
dahlia
the
vicar
interposed
and
ordered
them
out
of
his
church
just
as
the
cook
orders
me
out
of
her
kitchen
and
it
is
about
as
much
their
own
in
either
case
then
we
had
some
peace
and
the
vicar
used
to
come
himself
he
has
no
wife
and
worked
very
hard
at
handing
flowers
to
ariadne
who
did
not
look
half
bad
on
top
of
a
ladder
a
little
weak
and
tottery
so
that
she
had
to
be
steadied
by
a
strong
hand
now
and
then
at
home
there
was
cooking
to
be
done
cakes
and
pies
and
things
for
the
village
ball
and
we
both
cooked
christina
says
there
is
a
want
of
concentration
about
us
and
that
the
trail
of
the
is
all
over
her
best
chairs
she
says
it
to
callers
to
amuse
them
and
to
make
them
think
her
witty
though
really
ariadne
untidiness
is
trying
we
find
in
our
workboxes
and
currants
as
and
butter
well
everywhere
but
in
the
ariadne
goes
about
with
white
hair
and
peter
ball
complains
that
the
are
sticky
he
says
that
ariadne
cakes
when
made
will
form
a
capital
hunting
lunch
sustaining
if
eaten
and
capable
of
breaking
the
nastiest
fall
christina
cook
cooks
are
the
same
i
see
all
over
the
world
gave
her
annual
notice
which
is
never
taken
any
notice
of
just
before
the
festival
when
all
the
servants
are
so
overworked
that
they
get
fractious
luckily
this
time
something
happened
to
put
them
in
a
tearing
good
temper
again
farmer
dale
died
and
christina
blessed
him
for
giving
us
a
good
funeral
to
cheer
the
household
up
a
bit
so
the
status
was
preserved
on
the
sunday
morning
of
course
we
all
attended
divine
service
peter
ball
came
too
and
read
the
lessons
he
is
called
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
church
he
once
spoke
to
some
men
who
were
lounging
about
outside
while
the
service
was
proceeding
and
told
them
that
he
looked
to
them
to
be
pillars
too
they
sniggered
because
they
felt
ashamed
and
one
of
them
said
ay
sir
but
are
we
men
the
buttresses
up
against
it
and
propping
it
up
like
peter
was
only
shocked
we
workers
could
not
attend
much
on
this
particular
occasion
any
more
than
a
cook
can
enjoy
the
dinner
she
has
cooked
we
could
not
take
our
eyes
off
our
own
special
rail
that
we
had
wreathed
and
kept
hoping
our
flowers
would
topple
suddenly
because
we
had
tied
them
securely
enough
or
wilt
during
the
sermon
i
noticed
a
curious
sort
of
doll
standing
on
the
dressed
in
three
flounces
and
a
sash
as
we
came
out
i
asked
old
john
peacock
what
it
was
and
he
said
why
that
wor
t
kern
babby
i
was
no
wiser
but
ariadne
who
dotes
on
superstitions
said
she
would
ask
the
vicar
she
wrote
him
a
pretty
note
in
her
all
backwards
hand
and
said
she
felt
sure
the
doll
on
the
was
a
heathen
survival
of
some
sort
this
was
his
answer
he
was
pleased
my
dear
miss
your
interest
in
the
study
of
is
highly
commendable
in
one
so
young
the
little
mannikin
or
rather
womankin
is
as
you
aptly
conjecture
a
remnant
of
a
custom
dating
from
a
period
of
the
very
remotest
antiquity
in
our
northumbrian
villages
it
is
the
custom
the
moment
the
sickle
is
laid
down
for
the
villagers
to
dress
the
last
sheaf
in
tawdry
finery
and
carry
it
through
the
streets
finally
when
it
presides
at
the
harvest
or
mell
supper
and
the
people
dance
round
it
singing
be
the
day
that
christ
was
born
we
getten
mell
of
corn
it
well
bun
and
better
shorn
hip
hip
hurray
this
custom
was
found
however
so
prevocative
of
disorderly
scenes
that
my
revered
predecessor
here
decreed
that
in
future
the
mell
doll
or
kern
baby
should
be
simply
placed
on
the
during
divine
service
is
it
not
wonderful
to
reflect
that
this
grotesque
image
prefigures
no
less
a
personage
than
ceres
the
goddess
of
plenty
the
frigga
of
the
teutons
sometimes
called
freia
frey
conf
grimm
teutonic
mythology
passim
oh
yes
pass
him
pass
him
said
peter
impatiently
who
wo
however
let
any
one
else
make
fun
of
the
church
and
scolded
christina
for
saying
rather
a
for
a
goddess
was
it
well
she
remarked
to
ariadne
later
on
you
had
better
be
getting
up
your
mythology
meaning
the
bible
only
peter
did
twig
anything
so
wrapped
up
as
this
because
you
will
be
sure
to
be
subpoena
to
take
a
class
in
the
sunday
school
after
you
have
fished
for
it
dodd
impune
lacessit
ca
dodd
lace
his
boots
with
impunity
i
asked
peter
i
knew
it
was
that
any
more
than
angusta
means
please
to
keep
augusta
at
home
and
some
others
like
that
i
have
made
sure
enough
dodd
made
ariadne
take
a
class
in
his
sunday
school
and
christina
chuckled
it
is
the
price
of
dodd
admiration
and
he
admired
ariadne
very
much
she
is
not
really
any
happier
for
it
rather
bored
by
it
in
fact
she
spent
three
whole
days
getting
up
sacred
history
for
fear
the
school
children
who
have
of
course
been
properly
brought
up
and
grounded
should
floor
her
a
poor
feckless
literary
man
daughter
peter
ball
gave
her
a
little
arithmetic
she
got
as
far
as
proportion
with
him
there
was
one
sum
about
how
many
men
it
would
take
to
build
a
wall
of
so
many
feet
in
so
many
hours
if
it
was
inverse
proportion
which
it
might
be
and
then
again
it
might
you
put
the
men
under
the
wall
and
divide
by
the
hours
as
many
of
them
as
are
left
after
such
treatment
is
the
answer
it
came
stupidly
enough
so
i
suggested
to
ariadne
as
i
was
helping
her
to
put
men
and
a
peter
said
she
did
repay
teaching
and
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
though
his
wife
seemed
to
then
ariadne
started
an
essay
club
with
prizes
the
squire
bought
those
for
her
in
morpeth
when
he
went
in
to
sell
pelts
and
hides
fancy
touching
his
hand
after
that
they
were
bits
of
his
poor
beasts
that
he
had
killed
billy
scott
short
essay
on
the
elephant
animal
with
a
leg
at
each
corner
and
a
tail
at
both
ends
was
funny
and
sally
moscrop
description
of
animal
she
liked
to
she
invented
proc
a
beast
with
four
legs
of
whom
are
bigger
and
longer
than
the
others
for
the
proc
lives
all
around
a
grace
paterson
essay
was
quite
long
pin
is
an
exceedingly
useful
article
it
has
saved
the
lives
of
many
men
many
women
and
many
children
by
not
swallering
of
grace
is
fourteen
and
the
beauty
of
the
village
she
has
begun
a
tale
in
ten
chapters
she
has
to
write
it
up
in
the
for
fear
her
father
should
warm
her
she
and
ariadne
were
the
two
belles
of
the
ball
in
the
parish
room
on
monday
evening
they
both
danced
with
the
squire
who
said
he
was
in
luck
to
get
two
literary
ladies
to
dance
with
him
on
the
same
night
but
ariadne
walked
home
with
him
and
i
went
with
christina
rochester
had
one
of
his
own
roses
ariadne
had
given
him
back
in
his
she
is
so
unhappy
about
simon
that
she
does
care
who
proposes
to
her
that
is
the
way
girls
take
it
a
very
selfish
way
but
they
are
selfish
all
through
when
they
are
in
love
ariadne
actually
thinks
the
squire
thinks
he
proposed
to
her
going
home
that
night
i
do
it
was
pitch
dark
as
we
went
home
the
village
is
not
lighted
and
it
is
a
very
wicked
village
she
says
long
arms
like
tentacles
came
groping
out
from
the
wall
in
the
dark
and
the
squire
dragged
her
past
them
as
the
village
young
men
could
see
they
thought
her
one
of
their
own
sweethearts
for
by
then
the
party
had
broken
up
and
was
all
over
the
place
the
had
been
very
much
occupied
and
had
found
the
brook
near
the
door
very
handy
but
i
do
myself
think
the
squire
did
propose
he
offered
to
take
care
of
her
past
the
tentacles
but
not
for
life
i
think
if
a
girl
is
always
dreading
proposals
and
thinking
of
how
men
will
feel
it
when
refused
proposals
never
come
to
them
that
is
what
christina
said
and
that
peter
ball
took
her
entirely
by
surprise
when
he
asked
her
i
knew
better
for
i
had
chaperoned
that
affair
she
says
peter
wears
very
well
and
that
there
some
gilt
left
on
the
gingerbread
still
the
gramophone
is
still
in
all
its
glory
and
when
she
was
ill
when
jim
was
born
peter
used
to
send
up
a
message
by
the
nurse
for
her
to
leave
the
door
of
her
room
open
for
before
dinner
and
then
she
would
hear
it
the
nurse
always
forbade
it
but
christina
always
insisted
on
it
to
please
peter
and
lay
with
her
ears
stopped
up
with
sheet
till
the
half
hour
was
over
it
is
a
new
gramophone
not
the
one
he
had
in
leinster
gardens
that
shouted
itself
out
i
suppose
christina
found
an
entry
in
his
old
july
a
memorable
year
in
my
life
i
bought
a
new
gramophone
and
i
got
married
i
wo
say
anything
about
my
wife
here
but
the
gramophone
was
a
beauty
when
she
was
new
ariadne
was
disgusted
she
does
believe
simon
would
say
such
a
coarse
thing
well
i
wish
she
had
some
experience
on
the
subject
what
simon
would
say
that
all
when
simon
did
come
over
to
shoot
ariadne
hardly
spoke
to
him
during
the
three
days
he
was
here
no
one
did
much
he
is
so
fearfully
eligible
that
all
the
nice
girls
feel
they
must
snub
him
and
he
hardly
gets
a
cup
of
tea
if
christina
had
known
nice
girls
only
ariadne
would
have
had
a
better
chance
what
is
the
good
of
being
a
nice
modest
girl
among
other
nice
modest
girls
and
though
ariadne
would
not
believe
it
she
did
badly
without
her
foil
lady
scilly
who
showed
up
her
niceness
and
made
simon
draw
comparisons
then
there
was
another
adverse
circumstance
the
squire
came
and
followed
ariadne
about
with
his
eyes
till
it
really
was
safe
to
sit
in
a
line
with
them
both
that
put
simon
off
he
is
too
nice
to
prefer
a
girl
because
another
man
is
making
himself
unhappy
about
her
indeed
simon
looked
most
uncomfortably
serious
and
even
sad
he
has
got
his
first
wrinkle
fixed
between
his
eyebrows
he
looks
at
ariadne
often
but
in
a
puzzled
sort
of
way
and
takes
himself
up
with
a
jerk
shaking
his
head
that
the
curls
are
cut
off
from
too
short
to
waggle
he
cares
for
me
yes
he
cares
desperately
said
ariadne
one
night
just
as
she
was
arranging
her
watch
and
her
handkerchief
on
the
chair
beside
our
bed
and
his
photograph
under
her
pillow
i
have
to
take
that
away
every
morning
lest
the
housemaid
should
see
it
and
make
fun
of
her
ariadne
forgets
we
also
arrange
the
strap
of
our
box
down
the
middle
of
the
bed
so
that
neither
of
us
should
encroach
in
the
other
part
and
all
these
arrangements
take
time
ariadne
though
she
is
so
gentle
and
so
in
love
always
looks
sharply
to
her
rights
and
more
than
her
rights
and
i
generally
find
myself
lying
on
the
very
rim
of
the
bed
she
is
the
eldest
unfortunately
and
once
she
took
the
strap
out
of
the
bed
to
me
when
i
objected
he
loves
me
oh
he
does
she
moaned
only
he
is
not
free
he
is
in
the
power
of
a
wicked
witch
like
the
one
who
enchanted
jorinde
and
joringel
in
grimm
i
said
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
and
thought
a
little
lady
scilly
is
old
like
the
german
witch
but
i
remember
what
the
ollendorff
man
said
to
me
about
her
being
a
fairy
and
i
know
there
is
some
connection
between
them
fairies
are
those
who
would
do
harm
if
they
had
the
power
witches
have
the
power
but
only
because
they
are
old
and
do
care
for
the
things
they
cared
for
when
they
were
young
ariadne
will
never
be
a
fairy
when
she
grows
up
she
will
always
be
too
silly
and
get
put
upon
in
society
though
in
private
life
she
is
quite
up
to
her
rights
and
talks
as
loud
as
any
one
and
does
trouble
to
be
men
never
see
that
side
of
girls
mercifully
they
are
able
to
keep
it
out
of
sight
till
they
are
at
least
married
and
on
the
pig
back
as
peter
says
it
is
the
unromantic
things
they
are
ashamed
of
ariadne
would
mind
simon
knowing
she
had
appendicitis
but
not
for
worlds
that
she
had
a
corn
on
her
foot
and
had
to
have
it
cut
or
a
chilblain
and
it
burst
presently
she
woke
up
and
said
will
any
one
tell
me
why
a
woman
like
that
should
be
allowed
to
ruin
his
young
life
all
young
men
have
nine
lives
like
a
cat
there
will
be
eight
left
for
you
to
ruin
when
you
get
him
but
you
never
will
i
always
add
this
not
to
raise
false
hopes
and
goodness
me
you
ca
expect
to
get
a
young
man
all
to
yourself
as
fresh
and
shining
as
a
new
pin
yes
i
do
said
ariadne
crossly
i
want
a
even
i
am
a
new
pin
myself
i
have
never
loved
anybody
but
simon
now
have
i
i
did
answer
that
but
said
i
did
wish
we
might
turn
over
and
go
to
sleep
when
christina
rapped
on
the
wall
with
a
hairbrush
and
begged
us
to
be
quiet
yes
all
right
we
will
i
yelled
and
i
certainly
would
have
said
another
word
but
ariadne
began
again
five
minutes
later
tempe
why
do
these
wretched
married
women
i
be
ashamed
to
be
one
always
want
everybody
at
once
she
has
got
pawky
and
pawky
is
only
for
money
i
said
i
was
not
going
to
tell
her
about
her
dear
simon
paying
lady
scilly
bills
as
well
as
poor
pawky
and
simon
for
love
then
oh
dear
and
george
for
literature
i
am
prettier
than
her
tempe
say
i
am
oh
say
i
am
i
want
to
hear
you
say
it
i
wo
say
it
you
are
far
too
conceited
already
that
is
the
same
as
saying
it
answered
ariadne
and
got
calmer
and
at
all
events
i
am
real
and
that
more
than
she
can
say
i
do
have
to
peel
off
my
charms
and
put
them
away
in
a
drawer
like
she
has
to
ariadne
is
able
to
put
her
poems
quite
in
grammar
but
i
suppose
she
thinks
it
unnecessary
to
be
always
at
a
stretch
i
do
believe
realness
counts
at
all
with
young
men
i
said
i
believe
they
really
and
truly
enjoy
kissing
paint
and
groping
about
the
floor
for
pin
curls
when
they
done
and
powder
on
their
shoulders
when
they
go
out
into
the
street
from
calling
goodness
cried
ariadne
almost
shrieking
you
do
suppose
simon
ever
went
as
far
as
kissing
her
if
i
thought
that
i
what
never
let
him
kiss
me
again
he
has
of
course
yet
oh
tempe
i
wish
he
had
there
you
go
i
cried
out
sick
of
her
changeableness
first
you
want
him
not
to
then
you
wish
he
had
and
the
poor
thing
must
kiss
somebody
he
got
no
mother
and
kissing
almeria
would
be
like
kissing
a
cactus
or
cuddling
a
porcupine
do
please
keep
to
your
own
part
of
the
bed
you
do
respect
the
strap
a
bit
i
shall
be
on
the
floor
in
a
minute
i
lying
right
in
the
hem
of
the
sheet
now
ariadne
kindly
made
a
little
more
room
for
me
as
i
was
patiently
listening
to
her
and
went
on
tempe
i
have
learned
in
three
short
seasons
some
of
the
bitter
truths
of
society
just
then
as
any
one
could
have
foretold
from
the
noise
we
were
making
christina
walked
right
into
the
room
will
you
two
children
be
quiet
why
are
you
crying
ariadne
ariadne
said
she
was
crying
and
at
the
same
time
asked
christina
to
be
good
enough
as
she
was
up
to
get
her
a
clean
out
of
the
drawer
one
of
those
tied
up
with
blue
ribbon
not
pink
for
they
are
larger
and
plainer
christina
got
it
and
then
came
and
sat
on
my
foot
which
she
could
scarcely
help
doing
as
i
was
only
just
but
tumbling
out
of
the
bed
altogether
she
was
exceedingly
nice
and
sympathetic
and
agreed
that
lady
scilly
ought
to
put
simon
back
for
he
was
too
little
a
fish
for
her
to
hook
being
only
and
she
she
assured
ariadne
much
as
mother
used
to
assure
me
that
there
were
no
ghosts
then
if
there
are
what
are
the
white
things
one
sees
hanging
about
the
doors
of
rooms
that
simon
really
care
for
an
old
thing
like
that
and
that
if
he
did
her
attraction
must
naturally
wear
out
in
the
course
of
ages
and
that
simon
would
be
so
very
old
by
the
time
that
happened
and
would
know
a
nice
girl
when
he
saw
one
with
his
unjaundiced
eyes
she
also
thought
ariadne
should
not
put
upon
me
so
and
should
give
me
a
bigger
piece
of
bed
i
was
thinking
all
the
time
she
was
talking
of
george
and
how
mother
too
as
well
as
ariadne
was
unhappy
because
of
this
evil
fairy
i
wished
the
scilly
might
upset
and
spoil
lady
scilly
a
little
sooner
and
that
simon
might
be
in
it
when
that
happened
when
christina
had
tucked
me
in
and
kissed
us
and
gone
away
i
made
ariadne
make
me
a
solemn
promise
that
come
what
would
if
she
were
ever
married
to
simon
hermyre
or
indeed
to
any
one
else
that
she
would
let
all
the
others
alone
and
not
poach
for
even
if
a
young
man
seems
unattached
you
may
be
pretty
sure
there
a
girl
worrying
about
him
somewhere
in
the
background
one
woman
one
man
that
my
motto
and
indeed
a
woman
is
lucky
if
she
gets
a
whole
man
to
herself
as
christina
has
peter
and
well
she
knows
when
she
is
well
off
and
only
laughs
when
her
peter
says
as
he
did
at
breakfast
when
she
offered
him
quaker
oats
woman
have
you
learnt
that
my
constitution
clashes
with
cereals
ariadne
woke
up
with
a
plan
and
after
simon
had
gone
back
to
his
friends
at
henderland
without
proposing
and
a
hearty
breakfast
we
went
out
into
the
village
and
bought
of
beeswax
and
pinched
it
into
the
shape
of
a
skinny
woman
like
lady
scilly
as
near
as
we
could
then
we
laid
it
in
a
drawer
on
one
of
ariadne
best
silk
ties
and
we
stuck
a
pin
into
it
every
day
i
do
know
if
it
did
lady
scilly
any
harm
but
it
did
ariadne
a
great
deal
of
good
she
looked
down
the
columns
of
the
every
day
to
see
if
lady
scilly
was
ill
or
perhaps
even
dead
when
we
left
rattenraw
she
gave
the
waxen
image
to
christina
and
asked
her
to
be
good
enough
to
finish
up
the
boxful
of
best
short
whites
on
it
christina
promised
faithfully
that
she
would
and
said
that
we
might
rely
on
her
as
she
had
a
little
private
spite
of
her
own
to
work
off
on
that
lady
i
knew
what
it
was
lady
scilly
having
tried
to
flirt
with
peter
or
at
least
christina
thinks
that
she
did
wives
always
think
that
only
let
them
get
into
the
same
room
with
them
other
women
make
a
for
their
own
particular
dull
husbands
christina
is
nice
but
she
is
just
like
another
wife
when
it
comes
to
preserving
peter
the
squire
saw
us
off
with
an
enormous
bouquet
that
we
put
under
the
seat
having
started
and
forgot
so
did
ariadne
forget
the
squire
one
can
only
hope
that
after
a
decent
interval
he
will
marry
grace
paterson
she
is
a
substantial
farmer
daughter
in
spite
of
her
thinking
she
can
write
but
she
can
wring
a
fowl
neck
and
make
butter
two
things
that
ariadne
never
would
be
able
to
do
the
one
from
disgust
and
the
other
from
native
incompetence
and
a
hot
hand
as
regards
the
position
grace
is
very
nearly
a
lady
and
he
is
very
nearly
not
a
gentleman
so
it
ought
to
turn
out
all
right
chapter
xviii
lady
scilly
has
had
three
nervous
chills
this
autumn
and
one
motor
spill
and
a
half
so
i
think
that
the
sixpence
was
well
spent
on
beeswax
christina
in
her
letter
to
us
said
that
she
had
stuck
the
figure
so
full
of
pins
that
it
had
fallen
apart
whereupon
she
had
consumed
the
bits
before
a
slow
fire
muttering
incantations
the
while
i
asked
her
what
she
did
say
afterwards
and
she
said
that
devil
devil
devil
repeated
quite
steadily
till
it
melted
seemed
all
that
was
necessary
and
that
the
simplest
strongest
incantations
were
the
best
simon
hermyre
comes
here
very
often
to
call
on
mother
whom
he
likes
if
possible
better
than
ariadne
he
says
that
she
is
like
cigarette
in
a
novel
of
ouida
i
believe
cigarette
was
a
vivandière
i
suppose
it
is
mother
neat
figure
makes
him
think
of
her
as
cigarette
simon
adores
ouida
and
doré
is
his
favourite
artist
he
has
that
beautiful
wife
dream
hung
over
his
bed
at
home
he
says
i
always
think
it
looks
like
a
woman
going
down
into
her
own
and
awfully
afraid
of
beetles
christina
came
on
to
us
for
a
few
days
after
staying
with
her
and
brought
her
the
little
wanzer
and
taught
ariadne
and
me
to
manage
that
wretched
tension
of
which
one
hears
so
much
she
nearly
lockstitched
one
of
my
ears
to
the
table
as
i
was
learning
with
all
my
might
but
it
was
worth
it
and
to
ariadne
it
was
an
advent
up
to
now
she
has
always
thought
she
looked
very
nice
in
her
bags
with
holes
in
them
for
the
arms
and
her
twenty
necklaces
on
at
once
and
her
undescribable
colours
beautiful
colours
never
seem
to
look
quite
clean
do
you
know
it
is
all
very
well
for
george
he
is
an
author
and
not
young
but
young
men
like
you
to
look
fresh
and
and
above
all
to
have
a
waist
now
a
waist
is
not
even
allowed
to
be
mentioned
in
our
house
mother
left
off
hers
and
her
too
at
request
when
she
married
him
and
as
she
never
goes
anywhere
she
does
not
feel
the
want
of
them
but
even
when
ariadne
was
seventeen
elizabeth
cawthorne
said
that
it
was
time
that
she
began
to
see
about
making
herself
a
waist
and
although
george
laughed
ariadne
to
death
about
it
when
she
told
him
what
the
cook
had
said
yet
it
sank
in
and
i
used
to
wake
up
in
the
grey
winter
mornings
and
find
ariadne
sitting
up
in
bed
like
a
new
sort
of
penelope
taking
tucks
in
her
stays
which
mother
made
her
take
out
again
in
the
daytime
knowing
how
george
would
disapprove
of
it
ariadne
managed
to
sneak
a
waist
and
george
never
noticed
that
is
the
odd
part
of
it
we
all
think
that
that
inch
more
or
less
makes
such
a
difference
and
we
may
be
panting
with
uncomfortableness
all
the
time
and
to
the
outward
eye
look
as
thick
as
ever
ariadne
figure
is
not
her
best
point
her
hair
is
it
is
well
to
find
out
one
best
points
early
in
life
and
stick
to
them
as
they
say
of
friends
ariadne
trains
hers
day
and
night
in
the
way
it
should
go
but
does
want
i
wonder
it
stands
it
and
does
come
out
in
it
is
what
they
call
hair
like
cocoanut
fibre
think
but
papa
friends
admire
it
and
she
gets
the
reputation
of
being
a
beauty
on
it
in
our
set
but
in
lady
scilly
set
that
is
simon
set
more
or
less
they
think
her
a
pretty
girl
badly
turned
out
ah
you
are
your
father
daughter
i
see
christina
said
at
once
to
her
when
she
caught
her
sewing
a
black
on
to
her
nightgown
because
she
could
find
a
white
one
i
did
not
mention
that
i
myself
had
begun
to
sew
one
of
ariadne
iron
pills
on
to
my
shoe
and
only
stopped
because
it
did
seem
to
have
any
shank
but
i
was
saying
we
have
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
tidy
up
ariadne
before
she
goes
down
to
the
to
receive
simon
when
he
calls
ariadne
comes
out
of
her
room
and
somebody
catches
her
on
the
landing
and
buttons
her
frock
and
perhaps
the
housemaid
on
the
next
floor
points
out
to
her
that
she
has
got
on
any
waistband
and
another
in
the
hall
sticks
a
pin
in
somewhere
that
shines
in
the
sun
when
she
gets
into
the
and
simon
puts
his
head
on
one
side
and
looks
at
it
fixedly
as
usual
he
says
in
his
bad
french
accent
and
yet
he
was
two
years
at
a
crammer
to
get
him
into
the
foreign
office
and
one
in
germany
to
get
polish
all
before
we
knew
him
he
has
got
something
better
than
polish
i
think
and
that
is
breeding
he
is
not
the
least
and
yet
they
have
the
best
manners
in
the
world
simon
says
the
most
awful
things
rude
things
natural
things
but
how
can
one
be
angry
with
him
when
he
says
them
with
his
head
on
one
side
not
ariadne
certainly
and
yet
she
ca
stand
chaff
as
a
general
thing
peter
ball
could
make
her
cry
by
crooking
his
little
finger
at
her
simon
has
curly
hair
not
at
all
neat
which
he
can
neither
help
nor
disguise
though
he
forces
truefitt
to
shingle
it
like
a
convict
so
as
to
get
rid
of
the
curly
ends
which
are
his
greatest
beauty
in
mine
and
ariadne
estimation
ca
help
it
could
bear
to
look
like
one
of
those
chaps
he
means
the
men
he
meets
here
sometimes
not
so
often
as
before
though
for
george
is
revising
his
ariadne
hates
them
too
she
hates
everything
artistic
now
she
ca
bear
our
ridiculous
house
all
entrances
and
vestibules
and
no
bedrooms
and
boudoirs
to
speak
of
she
laughs
at
the
people
who
come
to
describe
it
and
photograph
it
for
the
art
papers
and
wonders
if
they
have
any
idea
how
uncomfortable
it
is
inside
and
how
different
from
highsam
that
simon
is
always
telling
her
about
as
for
simon
he
seems
to
think
it
rather
a
disgraceful
thing
to
get
into
the
papers
at
all
as
bad
as
getting
summoned
in
the
police
court
his
father
let
highsam
be
done
for
or
lend
mary
queen
of
cradle
to
the
new
gallery
frederick
cook
offered
to
put
portrait
in
with
her
prize
caspar
but
almeria
wrote
him
such
a
letter
rude
giving
him
her
mind
about
interviewing
she
has
a
mind
on
most
subjects
and
never
drifts
simon
has
the
greatest
respect
for
her
views
on
stable
matters
certainly
i
grant
her
that
but
what
can
a
country
mouse
however
know
of
the
troubles
of
town
her
father
trusts
her
to
go
to
wrexham
and
buy
the
carriage
horses
for
he
is
no
judge
of
the
festive
gee
now
he
says
almeria
likes
art
too
and
buys
up
all
the
christmas
numbers
and
frames
the
pictures
out
of
them
and
hangs
them
on
the
walls
of
highsam
hall
simon
has
borrowed
her
opinions
on
art
and
dress
too
and
they
are
the
same
as
ariadne
great
scott
he
said
to
ariadne
when
she
came
down
to
see
him
one
afternoon
when
he
called
wearing
her
best
new
medicean
dress
that
george
had
specially
designed
for
her
if
almeria
saw
you
in
that
frock
with
your
sleeves
tied
up
with
bootlaces
i
do
hope
you
wear
that
absurd
sort
of
fakement
at
my
aunt
meg
on
the
if
you
do
i
swear
i
wo
dance
with
you
in
it
of
course
he
did
mean
it
really
he
would
have
danced
with
ariadne
in
her
chemise
out
of
chivalry
and
cheek
but
still
ariadne
took
it
seriously
and
set
to
work
to
quite
alter
her
style
of
dressing
to
please
simon
the
invitations
to
lady
islington
dance
had
been
sent
out
a
whole
month
in
advance
so
you
had
to
accept
ariadne
had
time
to
take
a
few
lessons
in
scientific
dressmaking
and
then
start
on
a
christina
and
i
both
helped
her
for
we
are
as
keen
on
her
marrying
simon
as
she
is
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
we
want
her
in
a
county
family
not
a
bohemian
one
ariadne
bought
some
grey
and
scarlet
japanese
stuff
that
only
cost
a
yard
to
make
her
without
consulting
either
of
us
christina
said
deus
and
that
though
you
might
look
japanese
for
a
yard
you
never
could
look
smart
and
it
was
quite
true
ariadne
body
was
all
over
the
place
with
scientific
seams
meandering
where
they
should
when
it
was
basted
and
tried
on
she
looked
exactly
like
a
bagpipe
in
it
we
were
working
in
the
little
entresol
and
though
there
are
three
empire
mirrors
in
that
room
you
ca
see
yourself
in
any
one
of
them
so
we
had
to
tell
her
it
did
do
and
never
would
do
take
the
beastly
thing
off
then
said
ariadne
almost
crying
and
pitching
the
body
across
the
room
till
it
lighted
on
amelia
head
amelia
is
the
dummy
and
the
only
good
figure
in
the
house
i
wear
anything
at
all
and
i
daresay
you
will
look
just
as
nice
like
that
i
said
to
tease
and
console
her
but
she
would
be
and
she
left
the
body
clinging
to
amelia
and
began
to
put
on
her
old
blue
bodice
again
and
it
was
a
good
thing
she
did
for
the
door
opened
and
george
and
lady
scilly
came
in
dear
me
lady
scilly
said
in
her
little
drawly
voice
that
comes
of
lying
in
bed
late
you
look
like
the
maidens
sewing
i
persuaded
your
father
to
bring
me
up
to
have
a
look
at
you
he
says
you
are
so
clever
ariadne
and
make
all
your
own
dresses
so
george
had
taken
in
that
fact
i
always
thought
he
thought
dresses
grew
for
he
has
certainly
never
been
plagued
with
dressmakers
bills
the
eternal
feminine
making
the
garment
that
expresses
her
said
george
is
going
to
express
me
ariadne
said
under
her
breath
it
covers
me
and
that
all
i
always
think
george
maundered
that
the
symbolic
note
struck
in
the
toilette
is
in
the
nature
of
a
signal
a
if
you
will
of
the
prevailing
wind
of
a
woman
mood
her
moods
should
be
variable
she
should
be
a
violet
wail
one
day
a
in
blue
the
next
some
mad
scarlet
incoherent
thing
another
i
do
see
how
you
are
going
to
do
all
that
on
ariadne
said
again
for
george
was
too
busy
listening
to
himself
to
listen
to
her
impertinence
why
you
ca
even
get
the
colour
it
is
every
woman
duty
to
set
an
example
of
beautiful
dressing
without
extravagance
and
he
looked
at
lady
scilly
pretty
pink
fluffiness
paris
of
course
i
hate
paris
where
we
never
go
oh
this
she
said
very
contemptuously
looking
down
at
it
as
if
it
was
dirt
as
all
women
do
this
this
cost
nothing
at
all
i
have
a
clever
maid
you
know
if
all
the
women
had
clever
maids
that
say
they
have
christina
whispered
to
me
what
would
become
of
camille
i
wonder
george
continued
inventing
a
hobby
as
he
went
on
you
must
never
quit
an
old
dress
merely
because
it
has
become
unfashionable
my
dresses
quit
me
said
ariadne
dipping
her
elbow
in
the
so
that
the
hole
in
it
did
show
i
jealous
of
the
sofa
it
better
covered
than
me
i
believe
lady
scilly
noticed
her
do
this
and
though
she
is
lazy
she
is
kind
and
she
asked
ariadne
when
she
intended
to
wear
this
creation
at
lady
islington
ariadne
answered
rather
sulkily
oh
yes
i
know
a
cinderella
it
is
far
too
good
for
that
sort
of
romp
my
dear
child
i
have
a
little
thing
at
home
i
could
lend
you
just
to
dance
in
it
is
too
for
me
and
i
do
wish
some
one
would
wear
it
for
me
if
i
send
it
round
will
you
try
it
on
and
if
it
will
do
keep
it
and
wear
it
for
my
sake
when
is
the
dance
the
day
after
i
answered
for
ariadne
who
was
overcome
with
gratitude
for
she
knew
what
lady
scilly
little
dresses
were
like
camille
little
would
beat
ariadne
biggest
then
you
shall
have
it
and
if
you
can
wear
it
do
i
shall
be
so
much
obliged
ariadne
said
thank
you
a
little
ashamed
to
think
that
simon
was
coming
to
tea
and
that
the
only
reason
she
cared
about
the
dress
was
to
dance
with
simon
in
it
but
i
thought
the
settling
of
ariadne
in
life
and
marrying
into
a
county
family
was
far
more
important
than
lady
scilly
little
jealousies
and
wanting
to
keep
simon
to
herself
when
she
got
so
many
including
george
so
i
told
lady
scilly
she
was
a
brick
and
no
mistake
and
i
really
thought
so
but
christina
thought
ariadne
had
better
try
to
pull
the
first
dress
into
some
sort
of
shape
so
that
she
could
wear
it
if
the
other
dress
did
come
put
not
thy
trust
in
smart
women
she
said
and
as
it
happened
she
was
right
for
the
dress
never
did
at
five
on
the
very
day
of
the
dance
there
was
a
sign
of
it
and
ariadne
had
let
herself
worry
over
it
by
my
and
advice
we
told
her
that
she
had
better
keep
all
the
looks
she
had
to
carry
off
the
dress
for
it
would
require
them
she
worry
but
she
was
very
angry
with
lady
scilly
and
anger
made
her
eyes
so
bright
and
gave
her
such
a
pretty
colour
that
i
felt
sure
it
would
be
all
right
the
dress
was
so
very
bad
either
we
had
given
up
all
attempt
at
getting
it
to
fit
and
that
was
better
for
you
could
tell
that
ariadne
had
a
very
nice
simple
girlish
figure
underneath
elizabeth
cawthorne
came
up
to
see
her
girl
when
she
was
dressed
she
nearly
always
does
and
she
thought
the
dress
sweet
that
get
him
that
get
him
miss
ariadne
you
see
she
kept
saying
it
was
very
vulgar
but
then
poor
ariadne
was
so
much
in
love
that
she
could
help
liking
it
she
had
taken
particular
care
of
her
hair
and
when
she
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
afternoon
she
had
put
ten
curlers
in
to
make
sure
of
it
looking
nice
and
it
did
like
moses
in
the
burning
bush
at
nine
she
dressed
and
went
and
christina
gave
her
a
kiss
for
luck
and
i
went
to
bed
for
it
was
quite
ten
i
was
just
jumping
in
i
always
take
a
header
off
the
chest
of
drawers
to
stop
me
getting
stiff
when
i
heard
a
great
puffing
and
panting
at
the
bedroom
door
elizabeth
cawthorne
is
getting
fat
it
goes
with
and
beer
and
she
is
learning
to
drop
her
h
in
the
south
she
said
and
shoved
a
great
box
under
my
nose
lady
scilly
love
and
i
was
out
of
bed
again
in
two
twos
and
elizabeth
and
i
unfastened
the
string
and
there
was
a
i
felt
inclined
to
burst
out
crying
to
think
of
poor
ariadne
so
near
and
yet
so
far
dancing
away
perhaps
and
losing
simon
affection
at
every
step
because
her
dress
hung
badly
and
looked
and
here
was
a
perfect
dream
of
a
dress
lying
quite
useless
on
the
bed
in
my
room
at
home
elizabeth
would
have
it
out
to
look
at
i
indulged
her
keeping
her
rather
dark
fingers
off
it
as
well
as
i
could
it
was
all
white
and
fluffy
and
like
clotted
cream
and
i
do
believe
it
was
made
on
purpose
for
ariadne
there
was
a
note
with
it
addressed
to
my
sister
which
elizabeth
opened
in
her
excitement
i
forgave
her
it
said
dear
child
my
frock
i
found
was
not
quite
suitable
your
young
waist
must
be
larger
than
mine
so
i
have
ordered
one
to
be
made
for
you
and
i
do
hope
it
will
fit
and
that
you
will
look
very
nice
in
it
with
my
love
i
hope
too
that
your
father
will
approve
of
my
taste
ever
yours
paquerette
scilly
that
all
she
cares
about
that
george
should
think
her
generous
but
if
she
had
wanted
me
or
ariadne
to
be
grateful
she
should
have
managed
to
get
it
here
in
time
i
do
care
for
misplaced
generosity
suppose
miss
said
elizabeth
that
you
was
to
take
a
cab
and
go
to
where
miss
ariadne
is
and
make
her
change
better
late
than
never
i
say
my
sister
is
a
artist
i
regret
to
say
was
what
i
answered
and
elizabeth
agreed
and
added
too
that
she
altogether
lost
her
faith
in
the
other
dress
and
that
it
might
get
ariadne
an
offer
as
well
as
a
smarter
so
then
she
went
and
i
laid
the
dress
out
on
ariadne
bed
and
lay
down
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
it
and
i
did
and
even
dreamed
i
was
woke
by
feeling
a
heavy
weight
on
my
chest
at
first
i
thought
it
was
indigestion
but
as
i
began
to
get
more
awake
i
found
it
was
ariadne
who
was
sitting
there
quite
still
in
the
dark
i
joggled
her
off
and
then
i
began
to
remember
about
the
dress
but
thought
i
would
tease
her
a
little
first
well
did
you
have
a
good
time
i
asked
her
fairly
answered
ariadne
did
you
have
any
offers
in
that
dress
elizabeth
was
sure
you
would
i
believe
i
am
all
torn
to
bits
said
ariadne
walking
round
and
round
her
own
train
like
a
kitten
round
its
tail
and
not
intending
to
take
any
notice
of
my
question
now
do
expect
me
to
help
you
to
mend
it
it
will
take
days
ariadne
said
i
shall
not
touch
it
i
do
mean
to
wear
it
again
but
hang
it
in
a
glass
case
and
sit
and
look
at
it
it
is
a
wonderful
dress
do
drivel
i
said
unless
there
is
really
something
particular
about
the
dress
that
i
do
know
she
did
even
rise
to
that
so
i
said
i
wonder
you
do
light
up
and
have
a
good
look
at
it
there
is
no
hurry
is
there
about
lighting
the
candle
ariadne
said
sitting
plump
down
on
a
bureau
and
looking
as
if
she
did
mean
to
go
to
bed
at
all
i
believe
she
smelt
lady
scilly
dress
on
her
bed
and
was
keeping
calm
just
to
tease
me
did
any
one
see
you
home
i
asked
yes
some
one
did
she
answered
still
in
a
sort
of
dream
did
he
kiss
you
in
the
cab
i
at
last
asked
her
thinking
that
if
anything
would
rouse
her
that
would
she
was
sitting
as
far
as
i
could
tell
in
the
cold
moonlight
looking
fixedly
at
her
hand
as
if
she
wanted
it
to
come
out
in
spots
like
saint
catherine
emmerich
i
was
riled
to
extinction
oh
for
goodness
sake
get
to
bed
i
cried
and
if
you
are
going
to
undress
in
the
dark
to
hide
your
blushes
i
should
advise
you
to
get
into
your
bed
very
carefully
that
did
it
you
naughty
girl
she
said
quite
quickly
have
you
been
putting
lady
castlewood
there
with
her
new
lot
of
kittens
it
too
bad
of
you
she
lit
the
candle
and
then
i
noticed
that
her
ears
were
quite
red
she
saw
the
dress
at
the
same
instant
and
went
across
and
fingered
it
so
you
have
come
she
said
talking
to
it
as
if
it
were
a
person
you
are
rather
pretty
i
must
say
but
i
have
done
very
well
without
you
well
said
i
you
condescending
who
tore
your
skirt
if
one
might
ask
mr
hermyre
mister
now
how
intimate
you
have
become
to
be
afraid
of
his
name
ha
i
believe
she
shy
how
often
did
you
dance
with
hermyre
oh
do
tease
me
tempe
dear
as
often
as
there
was
i
am
afraid
afraid
yes
you
will
be
talked
about
and
he
will
have
to
marry
you
there
he
is
going
to
said
ariadne
quietly
letting
down
her
hair
i
know
my
own
ariadne
she
had
turned
cheeky
in
a
single
night
i
looked
about
for
something
to
take
her
down
with
and
i
found
it
did
you
did
you
put
your
head
on
his
shoulder
when
he
had
asked
you
as
we
have
always
agreed
you
would
i
may
have
i
do
know
i
hope
not
you
hope
you
did
but
you
know
you
did
well
i
wonder
it
did
not
run
into
him
or
put
his
eye
out
or
something
beast
what
do
you
mean
only
that
you
have
got
a
haircurler
in
your
hair
near
the
left
side
and
i
presume
it
has
been
there
all
the
evening
ariadne
put
out
the
light
and
came
and
sat
on
my
bed
after
that
and
told
me
all
about
it
quite
nicely
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
pique
had
begun
it
there
had
been
a
slight
difficulty
with
another
man
who
was
not
a
gentleman
although
he
was
a
count
fancy
at
lady
islington
and
he
had
been
rude
to
ariadne
about
a
dance
and
ariadne
had
appealed
to
simon
although
he
was
so
near
her
as
some
other
men
and
simon
had
at
once
insulted
the
other
man
and
had
danced
with
ariadne
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
to
spite
him
and
lady
scilly
who
had
brought
him
and
whose
new
mash
he
was
i
believe
he
the
german
chauffeur
i
saw
in
her
car
but
ariadne
would
have
it
that
it
was
the
fan
business
that
had
brought
it
on
that
fan
he
gave
her
at
whitby
he
had
broken
at
whitby
and
he
had
never
bought
her
a
new
one
we
had
often
talked
about
it
but
of
course
never
mentioned
it
to
simon
lady
islington
is
simon
aunt
meg
and
he
is
awfully
afraid
of
her
after
the
row
with
the
chauffeur
count
ariadne
had
felt
quite
strange
and
frightened
he
made
nasty
speeches
as
not
gentlemen
do
when
they
are
riled
and
simon
had
taken
her
to
a
in
a
long
gallery
sort
of
staircase
she
sat
beside
him
for
a
long
while
feeling
as
if
she
could
not
breathe
long
after
all
fear
of
the
other
man
had
passed
away
she
thought
it
could
hardly
be
that
still
and
yet
she
felt
as
if
a
cold
hand
or
a
key
like
when
your
nose
is
bleeding
was
being
put
down
her
spine
though
of
course
there
was
none
simon
did
say
anything
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
but
she
dared
not
look
at
him
for
some
reason
or
other
but
she
said
she
wished
as
she
sat
there
more
than
anything
else
she
had
ever
wished
in
the
world
more
than
she
had
wished
i
would
get
better
of
the
scarlet
fever
when
i
was
a
baby
that
he
would
take
hold
of
her
hand
that
was
lying
in
her
lap
she
kept
on
staring
at
it
imagining
his
taking
hold
of
it
willing
him
to
do
it
she
wanted
him
to
do
this
so
badly
that
she
nearly
screamed
and
asked
him
right
out
but
no
it
would
have
been
no
good
unless
he
had
done
it
of
his
own
the
music
had
not
begun
and
she
seemed
to
fancy
it
would
not
begin
until
simon
had
done
that
silly
little
thing
she
felt
somehow
that
he
was
thinking
of
this
too
or
something
like
it
something
to
do
with
her
at
any
rate
she
hated
explaining
all
this
to
me
but
i
made
her
for
she
had
always
solemnly
promised
to
me
she
would
tell
me
exactly
how
her
first
offer
took
place
then
the
music
began
and
the
people
on
the
stairs
got
up
and
some
of
them
were
sure
to
come
past
where
they
were
she
says
she
felt
simon
take
a
resolution
of
some
kind
and
yet
all
he
said
was
have
you
got
a
fan
ariadne
did
know
in
the
least
what
he
meant
but
she
knew
it
was
all
part
of
the
thing
that
had
to
happen
now
and
at
once
answered
quite
truly
i
have
got
one
you
broke
it
and
did
i
give
you
a
new
one
what
an
objectionable
brute
i
am
well
then
we
must
do
without
i
only
hope
my
aunt
meg
does
see
me
and
he
kissed
her
this
was
the
strangest
way
for
it
to
happen
as
ariadne
and
i
agreed
quite
different
from
all
our
plans
and
expectations
for
of
course
he
then
told
her
he
loved
her
and
wanted
to
marry
her
it
was
very
nearly
all
at
the
same
time
but
yet
he
kissed
her
first
nothing
can
alter
that
fact
and
it
was
in
the
wrong
order
and
so
i
shall
always
say
except
that
ariadne
has
made
me
promise
never
to
allude
to
it
again
and
of
course
as
she
kept
her
promise
i
shall
keep
mine
simon
nevill
hermyre
and
ariadne
florentina
are
to
be
married
in
three
months
at
latest
they
settled
it
that
very
night
subject
to
parents
sir
frederick
may
raise
objections
but
ariadne
was
able
to
assure
simon
that
george
wo
he
does
care
about
keeping
ariadne
a
day
longer
than
he
needs
to
as
simon
hermyre
she
is
only
an
encumbrance
now
not
an
advertisement
for
of
course
simon
wo
let
her
do
bohemian
things
or
dress
queerly
any
more
and
she
is
and
will
be
as
dull
as
for
at
least
a
year
like
all
engaged
girls
she
bores
me
chapter
xix
dear
simon
let
his
hair
grow
comparatively
long
to
be
married
to
ariadne
in
to
please
me
i
was
chief
bridesmaid
and
stood
next
almeria
jane
emerson
tree
was
third
bridesmaid
and
behaved
fairly
well
though
i
am
told
she
did
bite
off
and
eat
the
heads
of
the
best
flowers
in
her
bouquet
while
the
service
was
going
on
and
jessie
hitchings
who
stood
next
her
could
prevent
it
for
she
had
a
single
pin
on
her
she
could
get
at
i
expect
jane
emerson
was
very
ill
after
all
that
stephanotis
i
treated
her
with
studied
contempt
and
only
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
ariadne
waist
this
time
and
did
she
wish
she
could
have
one
as
above
reproach
when
she
was
married
if
she
ever
found
time
to
get
married
between
her
great
actings
why
ariadne
dress
was
made
by
camille
i
was
as
intimate
as
possible
with
jessie
hitchings
the
daughter
from
isleworth
that
did
jane
emerson
good
ariadne
asked
her
to
be
one
of
her
bridesmaids
just
to
please
ben
who
adores
her
and
does
see
that
she
is
a
bit
common
men
in
love
never
do
still
she
is
our
only
childhood
friend
so
simon
and
even
almeria
did
make
the
least
objection
to
have
her
included
in
the
procession
they
are
not
snobs
and
if
they
were
are
high
up
enough
to
be
able
to
afford
to
stoop
and
know
everybody
as
for
almeria
she
came
out
wonderfully
and
i
really
do
mind
her
at
all
as
the
bridesmaids
hat
would
set
without
a
bank
of
hair
or
something
on
the
forehead
for
it
to
rest
on
she
was
sensible
enough
to
buy
a
at
the
stores
and
stick
it
on
under
the
brim
for
the
occasion
ariadne
was
very
much
softened
towards
her
by
that
and
i
promised
to
go
and
stay
with
her
at
highsam
later
on
and
learn
to
ride
george
gave
ariadne
his
usual
present
only
more
so
a
set
of
his
own
works
beautifully
bound
and
some
of
the
old
jewellery
she
has
always
had
given
out
to
her
to
wear
to
take
away
for
her
very
own
mother
gave
her
all
her
household
linen
marked
and
embroidered
by
herself
peter
ball
gave
her
a
gramophone
christina
a
the
squire
gave
her
his
mother
best
lord
scilly
gave
her
a
great
gold
cup
or
beaker
i
believe
he
was
trying
to
atone
for
the
low
joke
he
had
practised
on
her
at
the
picnic
it
was
awfully
good
and
valuable
simon
said
lady
scilly
gave
her
a
shakespeare
bound
in
calf
i
believe
she
meant
a
hint
about
calf
love
just
the
kind
of
thing
she
would
call
a
joke
and
that
would
put
in
but
ariadne
never
noticed
and
was
grateful
for
she
happens
to
like
shakespeare
for
himself
to
simon
i
heard
lady
scilly
gave
a
queer
sort
of
scarf
or
thumb
ring
with
the
latin
word
engraved
on
it
i
did
not
know
what
that
meant
and
simon
said
he
was
blest
if
he
did
and
he
hung
it
on
his
dog
collar
afterwards
simon
and
ariadne
went
to
venice
for
their
honeymoon
she
took
but
could
not
write
any
poetry
in
venice
somehow
so
shopped
all
the
time
especially
bead
necklaces
she
did
care
for
her
own
hair
any
more
when
she
came
back
she
said
every
other
girl
in
venice
had
it
she
had
put
back
her
fringe
and
wets
it
every
morning
to
make
it
keep
flat
to
please
sir
frederick
hermyre
and
simon
who
owned
marriage
to
a
weakness
for
smooth
hair
they
are
to
live
in
yorkshire
at
one
of
his
father
six
places
he
has
given
it
to
simon
and
simon
is
now
the
youngest
on
the
bench
and
is
going
to
breed
shorthorns
i
am
to
go
and
stay
there
after
christmas
george
detests
christmas
so
much
that
he
ignores
it
and
forces
us
all
to
do
the
same
we
may
not
put
up
holly
or
mistletoe
or
make
a
or
we
have
always
at
midsummer
and
on
may
day
so
one
does
not
miss
them
altogether
but
all
the
same
i
have
a
sort
of
christmas
feeling
come
over
me
at
the
right
time
and
could
enjoy
a
christmas
stocking
or
santa
claus
as
much
as
any
ordinary
philistine
child
so
could
mother
elizabeth
says
it
is
all
she
can
do
not
to
give
warning
than
stay
in
such
a
house
over
the
time
and
she
makes
a
small
for
the
kitchen
and
gets
us
all
down
except
george
to
stir
it
on
the
sly
no
one
dares
to
mention
christmas
if
we
do
we
are
fined
sixpence
we
have
all
of
us
to
pay
a
whole
shilling
if
a
pipe
bursts
i
do
know
if
george
would
insist
on
money
down
if
it
happened
but
it
is
an
odd
circumstance
that
though
of
course
if
they
do
burst
it
is
fault
but
the
plumber
who
came
to
put
them
right
last
time
and
carefully
left
something
wrong
ready
for
the
next
now
that
this
rule
has
been
made
the
pipes
contain
themselves
and
do
burst
at
all
when
ariadne
was
here
she
always
contrived
to
send
away
a
few
parcels
and
we
received
some
of
course
we
can
not
help
people
who
respect
christmas
being
kind
to
us
then
george
came
in
once
while
we
were
undoing
a
few
and
damned
this
whirling
season
of
string
and
brown
paper
i
resent
the
maddening
appeals
of
an
to
post
early
why
should
i
post
early
why
should
i
post
at
all
i
forbid
all
mention
of
the
egregious
subject
and
he
went
out
and
we
asked
elizabeth
to
bring
our
parcels
up
to
our
bedrooms
in
future
the
christmas
after
ariadne
left
us
we
did
mind
obeying
him
we
were
so
sad
without
her
i
missed
having
some
one
to
bully
george
missed
having
two
to
bully
instead
of
one
he
has
always
sworn
but
now
he
took
to
swearing
as
if
he
meant
it
and
saying
bitter
things
to
mother
and
poor
ben
chances
of
school
are
farther
off
than
ever
he
got
quite
desperate
did
poor
ben
and
asked
mother
to
make
some
arrangement
by
which
she
could
give
him
less
to
eat
and
put
what
she
could
save
aside
for
his
schooling
he
said
he
was
willing
to
live
on
skilly
if
only
he
might
go
to
school
and
from
what
he
heard
he
would
get
much
better
there
so
he
might
as
well
get
used
to
it
mother
cried
and
said
no
she
could
save
off
his
keep
that
she
must
make
a
man
of
him
at
any
rate
and
would
try
to
save
money
some
other
way
or
even
make
it
she
would
think
till
she
thought
of
a
plan
meantime
she
would
buy
him
some
books
and
aix
would
look
over
his
exercises
if
ben
went
regularly
to
his
rooms
in
pump
court
ben
tried
but
it
is
so
awkward
for
him
since
he
started
valeting
george
at
whitby
george
ca
do
without
him
and
calls
for
him
at
all
sorts
of
times
and
ben
must
be
at
call
george
swears
at
his
sulky
expression
while
folding
up
coats
stretching
trousers
but
i
am
afraid
ben
will
have
the
melancholia
soon
if
he
does
get
what
he
has
set
his
heart
on
if
mother
could
only
raise
the
money
she
says
she
would
go
straight
to
george
with
it
and
tell
him
that
she
meant
to
pay
the
cost
of
ben
education
for
it
is
money
she
is
sure
and
nothing
but
money
which
prevents
his
making
up
his
mind
which
school
gracious
me
schools
are
all
alike
all
beastly
and
a
necessary
evil
for
the
sons
of
men
i
often
wonder
if
the
people
he
goes
among
and
stays
with
he
is
the
devil
for
country
houses
aix
says
he
has
got
them
in
the
blood
i
wonder
if
when
they
see
him
come
smiling
down
to
breakfast
he
has
to
come
down
to
breakfast
in
some
houses
never
at
home
they
realize
that
he
has
a
wife
and
children
and
a
secretary
and
three
cats
depending
on
him
for
i
believe
he
is
the
kind
of
useful
guest
who
has
small
talk
for
breakfast
which
reminds
me
of
those
houses
where
the
cook
gets
up
early
to
bake
the
little
hot
cakes
people
like
and
what
it
means
to
her
no
one
imagines
george
stokes
and
talks
at
the
same
time
and
that
is
one
reason
why
they
all
love
him
and
ask
him
madly
for
saturdays
to
mondays
or
longer
george
is
not
well
just
now
his
voice
is
all
in
his
throat
and
husky
his
hair
is
getting
very
grey
and
suits
him
his
eyes
are
large
like
a
sad
deer
he
is
still
as
graceful
aix
says
he
has
taken
to
wearing
stays
i
do
believe
this
i
am
the
only
one
in
the
house
who
sticks
up
for
george
ben
hates
him
so
does
aunt
gerty
ben
will
go
on
hating
him
till
he
is
allowed
to
go
to
school
mother
never
speaks
of
him
so
i
do
know
how
she
feels
about
him
in
cold
weather
he
is
always
much
nicer
to
her
he
feels
the
cold
of
england
he
has
written
about
italy
till
he
is
half
italian
he
has
got
a
new
secretary
a
singularly
colourless
personage
whom
mother
likes
very
much
she
is
half
so
amusing
as
christina
but
lady
scilly
says
she
is
far
more
suitable
after
christmas
was
over
george
left
us
and
went
to
the
hutch
lady
scilly
place
in
wiltshire
her
novel
is
nearly
finished
and
ben
says
she
has
piped
all
hands
on
deck
i
mean
all
the
people
who
are
helping
her
have
to
be
ready
with
their
help
there
is
a
lawyer
and
a
doctor
among
the
crew
but
george
is
i
believe
that
she
will
drop
them
all
when
once
the
book
is
done
george
too
perhaps
though
i
am
not
sure
she
likes
him
only
for
the
sake
of
the
novel
he
can
be
fascinating
when
he
likes
and
he
does
like
with
her
it
such
a
good
old
title
i
think
i
am
right
for
he
was
away
a
long
time
indeed
he
has
never
stayed
so
long
at
the
hutch
before
he
has
his
own
suite
there
and
all
the
other
rooms
are
called
after
the
names
of
his
novels
or
characters
in
them
could
any
one
pay
an
author
a
greater
compliment
ptomaine
was
not
staying
there
never
no
more
but
she
has
a
lady
friend
who
was
and
the
friend
says
lord
scilly
is
beginning
to
get
restive
ptomaine
comes
to
see
us
at
least
to
see
aunt
gerty
a
good
deal
she
is
no
longer
all
in
all
with
lady
scilly
since
the
pawky
episode
and
i
did
make
much
of
him
after
all
she
told
mother
and
aunt
gerty
lady
scilly
had
squeezed
him
nearly
dry
he
did
trust
women
any
more
always
imagined
they
wanted
money
and
then
dangled
an
empty
purse
at
them
metaphorically
poor
old
man
it
is
a
shame
to
destroy
any
one
even
a
millionaire
confidence
in
human
nature
she
borrows
of
every
one
even
the
masseuse
and
the
charwoman
my
dear
it
quite
awful
that
poor
pretty
young
hermyre
i
was
quite
pleased
when
your
sweet
innocent
daughter
rescued
him
from
the
wiles
of
scilly
and
perhaps
charybdis
who
knows
he
looked
weak
and
so
secured
a
weak
child
to
look
after
him
and
strengthen
his
hands
said
mother
it
is
no
use
minding
tommy
she
is
quite
eighteen
carat
aunt
gerty
says
or
else
she
would
surely
not
discuss
a
woman
own
to
her
face
but
she
is
a
journalist
and
journalists
know
no
laws
of
consanguinity
or
decency
even
if
one
is
to
get
any
good
whatever
out
of
the
press
one
must
accept
it
with
all
its
inconveniences
and
aunt
gerty
and
mother
think
everything
of
the
press
in
these
days
they
ask
ptomaine
to
dinner
continually
and
freddy
cook
to
meet
her
and
aix
as
a
standing
dish
and
aunt
gerty
of
course
then
they
make
a
lot
of
noise
and
smoke
all
over
the
house
except
the
study
mother
wo
let
them
go
in
there
at
all
while
george
is
away
i
hear
them
talking
between
the
puffs
you
can
engage
to
work
so
and
so
eh
or
have
you
got
thingumbob
aix
is
writing
a
play
he
brings
the
acts
over
here
as
he
writes
them
and
gets
mother
to
speak
the
woman
part
for
him
so
that
he
sees
how
it
goes
he
says
mother
is
a
great
dear
and
he
tells
her
continually
how
she
helps
him
how
she
puts
the
right
interpretation
on
him
at
every
turn
i
never
should
have
thought
aix
difficult
to
understand
but
then
a
man
has
to
be
very
modest
to
realize
that
he
takes
no
understanding
and
is
as
plain
as
a
and
as
aix
always
speaks
the
brutal
truth
he
ca
wrap
anything
up
he
is
as
crude
as
the
day
so
george
often
says
i
do
see
cleverness
they
talk
of
the
play
as
if
it
was
a
baby
must
christen
it
before
it
is
brought
into
the
world
and
one
thing
you
can
confidently
predict
about
it
it
ca
be
born
prematurely
and
so
on
they
use
the
study
in
the
mornings
and
aix
sits
in
george
and
mother
takes
the
floor
in
front
of
him
she
reads
the
woman
part
out
aloud
and
he
criticises
her
she
must
do
it
pretty
well
for
he
often
calls
out
oh
you
darling
when
she
has
said
a
particular
piece
what
a
divine
accent
you
give
it
that
will
knock
them
wicked
to
hide
such
a
talent
and
praise
like
that
he
never
asks
aunt
gerty
to
read
any
though
she
is
a
real
actress
and
sits
there
and
criticises
mother
all
the
time
pooh
pooh
says
aix
leave
her
to
her
intuitions
you
battered
professionals
do
know
the
value
of
a
new
note
so
i
see
that
mother
never
was
a
professional
even
before
george
married
her
and
a
good
thing
too
aix
worked
very
hard
at
the
play
and
promised
that
it
should
be
finished
one
day
next
week
when
george
came
home
he
would
want
his
study
of
course
but
we
had
the
remotest
idea
of
his
arriving
when
he
did
late
one
afternoon
just
before
we
were
all
hard
at
it
in
the
study
aunt
gerty
was
making
a
pink
surah
blouse
all
over
the
study
table
and
being
prompter
as
well
aix
was
in
george
and
mother
standing
in
front
of
him
george
was
on
us
in
a
moment
just
as
aix
had
closed
the
manuscript
with
a
slap
our
child
comes
on
bravely
he
was
just
saying
to
mother
as
george
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
his
cigarette
in
his
mouth
aunt
gerty
whispered
to
mother
i
bet
you
lord
scilly
has
had
him
kicked
out
of
the
house
go
on
that
tack
and
bolted
into
the
hall
forgetting
her
pink
surah
spread
all
over
the
desk
welcome
back
old
fellow
said
aix
turning
round
in
the
and
putting
a
protecting
paw
over
aunt
gerty
blouseries
they
would
be
sure
to
irritate
george
he
knew
so
they
did
george
turned
quite
white
with
temper
and
flung
his
coat
off
and
mother
caught
it
across
her
arm
as
if
she
had
been
a
servant
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
noise
in
the
hall
and
polly
came
in
looking
disgusted
as
servants
always
do
when
it
is
a
question
of
not
paying
one
just
debts
she
began
if
you
please
sir
the
cabman
but
her
voice
was
quite
drowned
between
the
cabman
relieving
his
mind
in
the
hall
outside
and
george
inside
he
seemed
bewildered
but
able
to
swear
all
the
time
wo
you
pay
your
cab
george
said
mother
gently
and
then
you
can
abuse
me
at
your
leisure
aix
went
to
pay
the
man
and
i
thought
i
had
better
get
out
of
the
room
with
him
george
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
and
mother
like
a
little
before
him
i
do
know
what
they
said
to
each
other
but
george
would
come
out
to
dinner
but
had
a
plate
sent
in
mother
did
alter
her
habits
but
went
to
the
theatre
with
mr
aix
george
plate
of
dinner
came
out
untouched
after
all
it
was
my
own
father
and
he
had
come
all
the
way
from
wiltshire
and
perhaps
had
been
kicked
out
of
the
hutch
as
aunt
gerty
said
i
knew
enough
of
lady
scilly
to
know
how
changeable
she
is
and
perhaps
it
was
only
her
novel
she
cared
for
i
went
to
him
as
bold
as
a
lion
he
was
sitting
still
where
he
had
been
before
dinner
only
his
head
was
on
his
hands
among
aunt
gerty
blouse
trimmings
shall
i
take
these
away
i
asked
do
they
make
you
angry
i
have
noticed
i
saw
he
was
ill
not
to
mind
all
aunt
gerty
horrid
pink
shape
all
over
his
papers
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
he
did
even
scold
me
where
is
lucy
my
wife
he
asked
me
presently
my
mother
said
i
she
gone
to
the
theatre
is
that
usual
quite
usual
she
generally
goes
with
aix
but
aunt
gerty
has
gone
with
them
chaperons
them
eh
i
did
like
to
hear
him
call
mother
and
aix
in
that
insulting
bracketting
way
so
i
said
mother
has
stayed
in
all
her
life
she
wanted
a
change
aix
said
he
for
a
change
god
she
collaborating
with
mr
aix
damn
him
and
his
play
too
oh
not
his
play
george
mother
would
be
grieved
then
george
suddenly
pulled
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
said
read
that
aloud
child
is
it
a
bit
of
your
new
novel
yes
it
is
a
bit
of
my
new
novel
read
i
did
talk
and
talk
and
never
act
oh
this
curse
of
civilization
you
make
excuses
for
s
for
your
bitter
enemy
magnanimous
but
effete
he
is
behaving
well
but
so
unpicturesquely
he
offers
a
woman
no
excuse
for
staying
with
him
oh
italy
italy
you
magician
have
made
me
long
for
the
life
of
italy
the
silver
incandescent
sands
the
passionate
brown
of
the
olives
but
why
should
i
try
to
outdo
you
in
your
own
imitable
manner
you
mean
do
you
child
but
no
we
will
not
trust
this
white
devil
of
italy
go
and
fetch
me
a
plateful
of
cold
meat
and
here
are
the
keys
go
down
to
the
cellar
and
get
a
bottle
of
burgundy
corton
you
see
the
label
we
will
carouse
i
was
delighted
george
and
i
finished
the
bottle
between
us
and
he
ate
a
good
supper
and
said
no
more
of
aix
or
mother
either
i
almost
liked
george
just
then
i
saw
why
lady
scilly
liked
him
he
is
funny
and
gentle
i
asked
him
to
choose
a
school
for
ben
and
he
said
he
would
think
about
it
it
is
the
oddest
feeling
to
suddenly
become
pals
with
one
own
father
i
had
never
known
it
before
there
is
some
good
in
george
and
his
eyes
are
very
bright
chapter
xx
my
mother
is
changed
not
horrid
but
quite
changed
she
goes
out
nearly
every
morning
at
ten
with
aunt
gerty
whose
manners
are
worse
than
ever
and
who
has
a
little
chuckling
cheerful
way
of
going
about
that
simply
irritates
me
to
death
there
is
a
secret
evidently
and
george
and
i
are
out
of
it
it
brings
us
together
he
is
not
happy
no
more
than
i
am
no
more
than
mother
is
she
is
excited
not
happy
she
has
taken
to
wearing
her
mouth
shut
lately
once
we
used
to
tease
her
because
she
kept
it
open
and
looked
always
just
as
if
she
were
going
to
speak
or
had
done
speaking
but
mother
is
a
good
woman
although
she
gads
about
so
much
she
does
neglect
her
household
duties
she
sees
after
george
comfort
as
much
as
ever
and
keeps
all
onions
out
of
the
house
as
usual
the
more
she
fusses
over
him
the
less
he
likes
it
he
shook
his
head
once
when
mother
had
tidied
his
for
him
it
took
her
two
hours
and
then
he
said
a
bad
sign
tempe
read
your
balzac
i
do
read
balzac
and
i
do
know
what
george
means
i
do
try
and
i
find
that
is
the
best
sort
of
sympathy
one
can
give
at
any
rate
he
likes
it
and
he
is
always
having
me
in
his
study
and
teaching
me
to
and
saying
little
things
like
that
i
have
put
down
under
his
breath
he
mutters
a
good
deal
to
himself
not
to
me
and
wants
not
so
much
some
one
to
talk
to
as
some
one
to
talk
at
we
hear
no
more
of
lady
scilly
she
has
not
been
here
since
ariadne
was
married
ariadne
was
an
excuse
mother
never
gave
her
an
excuse
to
come
to
see
her
she
had
never
accepted
her
or
been
rude
to
her
either
she
simply
ignored
her
so
lady
scilly
not
having
ariadne
to
come
and
fetch
had
no
particular
reason
for
coming
to
us
unless
she
came
to
see
george
and
she
could
have
seen
him
more
easily
at
the
hutch
or
her
till
quite
recently
she
used
to
come
here
about
her
novel
but
most
uncomfortably
for
christina
was
a
sad
dragon
and
looked
down
her
nose
at
her
christina
could
curl
her
nostril
really
which
very
few
women
can
do
it
is
a
horrid
thing
to
have
done
at
you
and
withers
you
soonest
of
anything
now
the
novel
is
finished
and
the
copy
tied
up
like
christmas
meat
is
going
the
social
round
of
all
the
literary
men
who
have
been
asked
to
her
with
a
view
to
their
favourable
opinion
i
know
that
frederick
cook
has
had
it
and
written
her
a
polite
letter
about
it
though
that
wo
prevent
him
slating
it
in
if
he
wants
to
so
ptomaine
says
i
know
that
what
aunt
gerty
said
in
spite
and
to
give
mother
a
stick
to
hit
george
back
with
when
he
came
and
found
us
doing
dressmaking
in
his
sacred
study
was
true
lord
scilly
had
told
george
not
to
go
to
his
house
any
more
perhaps
lady
scilly
had
said
he
might
having
no
more
use
for
george
she
may
have
given
lord
scilly
a
free
hand
with
him
and
perhaps
a
free
foot
who
knows
i
think
she
is
not
nice
i
am
on
george
side
now
as
far
as
outside
politics
go
though
i
shall
never
approve
of
the
way
he
treats
my
brother
benvenuto
lady
scilly
came
to
cinque
cento
house
at
last
and
george
did
look
that
pleased
to
see
her
as
elizabeth
cawthorne
said
afterwards
elizabeth
cawthorne
has
no
opinion
of
her
nor
of
the
way
she
goes
on
with
that
german
fellow
she
means
the
man
who
was
so
rude
to
ariadne
at
the
islingtons
at
least
he
was
far
too
kind
for
politeness
he
was
a
count
then
but
he
is
also
lady
scilly
chauffeur
he
was
waiting
outside
on
her
motor
at
this
very
moment
quite
the
servant
she
took
him
to
her
aunt
ball
for
the
fun
of
it
i
suppose
and
it
was
easy
to
pretend
he
was
somebody
for
he
looks
quite
military
and
distinguished
elizabeth
showed
her
into
the
study
saying
gruffly
a
female
to
see
you
sir
paquerette
said
george
in
real
amazement
as
she
floated
in
and
when
the
door
had
closed
on
elizabeth
cawthorne
went
a
little
down
on
one
knee
and
looked
up
into
george
face
saying
as
i
have
heard
the
french
do
to
their
professors
of
painting
or
music
maître
george
had
taught
her
to
do
this
in
the
days
when
he
was
really
her
professor
and
she
wanted
to
do
everything
as
bohemians
do
in
the
quartier
latin
but
only
the
way
she
looked
at
him
as
she
said
it
i
could
tell
that
she
had
no
further
use
for
him
i
was
sitting
at
the
in
the
corner
of
the
room
as
if
i
were
in
my
castle
and
i
stayed
there
it
was
getting
dark
and
they
did
think
of
turning
on
the
electric
light
besides
george
had
at
first
made
me
a
little
sign
which
i
understood
because
of
the
we
had
had
for
some
time
to
stay
where
i
was
and
i
like
doing
what
people
seem
to
want
especially
when
it
goes
with
what
i
want
myself
then
he
forgot
me
altogether
lady
scilly
i
believe
never
saw
me
at
all
for
she
never
said
or
looked
my
way
and
yet
we
had
not
quarrelled
george
put
on
his
pretty
woman
manner
and
raised
her
and
made
her
sit
in
a
nice
chair
that
suited
her
how
nice
of
you
to
come
my
wife
is
out
by
the
way
i
may
as
well
tell
you
she
is
leaving
me
i
nearly
fell
off
my
chair
lady
scilly
looked
upset
for
she
come
to
see
mother
and
had
thought
of
asking
whether
she
was
out
or
not
she
collected
herself
and
said
to
george
with
some
dignity
you
put
it
crudely
i
do
i
never
mince
my
words
except
in
books
it
is
as
i
say
i
shall
not
oppose
it
i
hope
that
my
unhappy
partner
may
one
day
come
to
know
the
bourgeois
happiness
i
have
been
unable
to
give
her
unlucky
fellow
that
i
am
de
you
know
an
alastor
of
fitz
avenue
the
villon
of
maresfield
gardens
no
woman
such
a
fool
as
to
leave
a
place
like
this
what
does
shelley
say
first
leaves
the
nest
you
certainly
are
a
most
extraordinary
man
she
mumbled
george
puzzled
her
by
changing
about
so
yes
he
answered
her
smiling
come
take
off
your
furs
and
make
yourself
at
home
compromise
yourself
merrily
i
suppose
now
by
all
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
it
i
ought
to
invite
you
to
bolt
with
me
but
i
am
weak
i
shall
not
are
you
quite
sure
you
wo
be
stronger
by
the
end
of
this
interview
oh
is
this
an
interview
ah
why
be
formal
and
boring
why
stable
the
steed
after
the
horse
i
mean
the
novel
is
out
it
will
be
a
huge
success
so
your
enemies
predict
frederick
cook
of
writes
me
that
this
the
latest
output
of
a
militant
aristocracy
seeking
to
beat
us
with
our
own
weapons
is
chockful
of
cleverness
and
primitive
woman
what
more
do
you
want
the
novel
i
want
she
said
stamping
her
foot
oh
throw
away
the
fugitive
husk
and
the
rind
outworn
the
creed
forgotten
the
deed
forborne
how
does
it
go
give
a
poor
author
a
chance
now
that
you
have
sucked
his
commonplace
book
dry
and
torn
the
heart
out
of
his
theories
butchered
him
to
make
a
literary
holiday
you
unkind
do
say
that
it
is
unworthy
of
you
stale
like
the
plot
of
the
new
novel
you
propose
we
should
work
out
together
i
am
prepared
to
go
all
lengths
to
assert
your
powers
of
imagination
i
do
doubt
it
but
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
find
it
a
ghastly
an
impossible
plot
no
it
would
never
do
not
even
if
we
made
a
of
it
it
wo
go
on
all
fours
it
would
not
even
begin
to
sell
it
has
none
of
the
elements
of
popularity
to
begin
and
end
with
there
not
an
atom
of
passion
about
it
not
even
so
much
as
would
lie
on
twenty
thousand
pounds
of
radium
and
you
know
how
much
that
is
do
imply
that
i
am
incapable
of
passion
in
that
insulting
way
she
said
quite
angrily
it
shall
never
be
said
it
will
never
be
said
unless
we
run
away
and
apply
the
test
of
boulogne
and
social
ostracism
believe
me
paquerette
things
are
best
as
they
are
going
to
be
there
true
evolution
in
it
when
the
feast
is
over
you
put
out
the
fluttering
candles
tear
down
the
wreaths
open
the
windows
when
the
novel
is
done
i
hate
you
to
talk
like
this
said
she
making
a
cross
face
women
hate
realism
women
hate
lukewarmness
pull
yourself
together
george
and
let
us
lay
our
heads
together
to
make
scilly
look
silly
he
mad
just
now
but
it
will
pass
off
he
will
get
over
it
and
you
will
come
down
to
us
at
hutch
as
usual
and
more
so
dear
old
scilly
will
be
the
first
to
climb
down
george
shook
his
head
no
no
bis
in
not
twice
in
the
same
place
i
was
sure
if
he
was
alluding
to
the
kick
lord
scilly
had
given
him
or
not
go
now
you
sweet
woman
i
want
to
be
alone
you
are
staid
for
yes
yes
i
must
go
you
remind
me
the
count
will
be
so
deliciously
irritated
thanks
so
much
so
very
very
much
for
all
your
help
and
timely
assistance
your
has
the
play
been
worth
the
scandal
george
asked
her
while
he
was
kissing
her
hand
to
hide
how
much
he
loathed
her
and
was
glad
she
was
going
he
knew
as
well
as
i
knew
that
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
who
kicks
away
the
ladder
she
has
just
got
up
by
with
a
toss
of
her
fairy
foot
and
that
he
would
never
be
asked
to
the
hutch
again
aix
would
more
probably
because
he
may
chance
to
review
what
george
has
helped
her
to
write
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
has
been
massaged
so
much
or
so
long
or
something
that
her
cheeks
are
like
flabby
oysters
and
her
figure
brought
out
in
all
the
wrong
places
she
was
too
pretty
to
last
kittenish
and
fluffy
as
she
was
when
i
saw
her
come
out
of
the
that
first
day
then
george
she
said
with
something
between
a
sneer
and
a
sob
we
meet
again
in
society
not
under
the
clock
at
charing
cross
what
should
take
george
and
her
there
i
can
not
imagine
but
george
bowed
and
led
her
out
and
i
followed
them
there
was
her
chauffeur
in
the
car
as
large
as
life
and
as
a
german
though
indeed
he
is
very
i
can
see
that
he
is
cross
in
every
line
of
his
back
lady
scilly
whispered
to
george
as
she
left
him
on
the
steps
and
tripped
down
them
and
got
in
beside
her
crabstick
count
he
received
her
most
coldly
and
it
was
easy
to
see
he
was
her
master
more
than
her
servant
george
grunted
as
he
fastened
the
door
there
was
an
east
wind
blowing
and
he
was
afraid
of
catching
cold
after
standing
there
bareheaded
she
will
probably
bolt
with
him
before
the
year
is
out
he
said
as
we
went
back
to
the
study
shivering
he
played
with
me
till
it
was
all
he
was
good
for
he
said
and
as
the
game
appeared
to
amuse
him
i
did
mind
making
a
fool
of
myself
for
once
about
mother
going
away
that
he
spoke
of
to
lady
scilly
i
believe
it
really
is
with
aix
as
george
is
so
very
civil
to
him
i
do
see
who
else
it
could
be
for
we
see
more
of
him
than
of
any
one
else
he
is
george
greatest
friend
as
well
as
mother
and
people
do
run
away
with
perfect
strangers
as
a
rule
mother
was
certainly
up
to
something
for
her
eyes
were
as
bright
as
glass
and
she
had
hysterics
two
days
running
aunt
gerty
used
to
say
while
these
were
going
on
slapping
mother
palms
and
vinaigretting
her
it
is
natural
you
know
the
excitement
the
excitement
of
running
away
i
suppose
she
used
to
make
her
lie
down
a
great
deal
and
nurse
her
energy
for
she
would
want
it
all
mother
was
by
far
the
most
important
person
in
the
whole
house
in
these
days
and
instead
of
george
being
out
late
and
needing
his
it
was
mother
who
was
always
on
the
go
and
dining
with
the
press
every
other
night
of
her
life
at
least
i
suppose
ptomaine
and
freddy
cook
are
the
press
they
are
certainly
nothing
else
of
importance
mother
joined
a
club
and
stayed
there
one
night
when
there
was
a
fog
george
never
asks
her
any
questions
he
is
too
proud
and
of
course
he
knows
that
she
is
too
she
would
stand
having
her
movements
questioned
any
more
than
he
would
but
he
began
to
look
ragged
and
grey
and
to
have
indigestion
he
lived
chiefly
in
his
study
he
fenced
a
good
deal
with
aix
he
asked
aix
to
leave
the
button
off
his
foil
but
aix
would
not
george
other
distraction
is
father
mack
who
comes
to
see
him
a
good
deal
and
when
george
goes
out
now
which
he
seldom
does
it
is
to
see
father
mack
father
mack
is
not
oppressively
stiff
once
george
came
back
from
confession
and
set
us
all
to
try
and
translate
the
survival
of
the
fittest
into
french
a
problem
father
mack
had
asked
him
father
mack
also
gave
mother
the
address
of
a
very
good
little
dressmaker
he
lent
george
the
of
saint
catherine
a
lovely
book
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
can
think
so
hard
of
something
that
it
comes
out
all
over
their
bodies
in
spots
people
came
from
far
and
wide
to
look
at
her
and
admire
her
and
her
family
allowed
it
instead
of
getting
a
trained
nurse
at
shillings
a
week
and
giving
her
a
free
hand
till
catherine
was
cured
it
is
my
belief
that
she
did
not
want
to
be
cured
she
liked
being
praised
for
having
so
many
spots
that
you
could
fancy
it
was
all
in
the
shape
of
a
crown
of
thorns
still
it
is
a
nice
romantic
story
and
the
poor
woman
meant
well
aunt
gerty
says
george
is
going
to
be
a
and
that
i
shall
have
to
be
baptized
over
again
and
not
buried
in
consecrated
ground
when
i
die
she
said
i
need
not
bother
to
go
on
with
preparing
for
my
confirmation
as
all
that
would
be
stopped
i
was
hemming
my
veil
and
i
went
on
for
i
believed
she
was
teasing
and
as
for
father
mack
he
is
quite
a
nice
man
and
george
does
swear
half
so
badly
since
he
came
under
his
influence
one
of
these
nights
when
mother
had
gone
off
to
dine
at
some
restaurant
or
other
with
a
merry
party
aunt
gerty
said
i
had
a
talk
with
ben
george
as
usual
now
dined
in
his
study
alone
ben
told
me
some
things
mother
had
been
saying
to
him
about
better
times
coming
and
darkest
before
dawn
and
so
on
he
wanted
me
to
explain
her
but
i
could
for
the
only
fact
i
knew
viz
her
going
to
boulogne
with
aix
would
not
do
ben
any
good
that
i
could
see
it
is
really
no
use
trying
to
find
out
what
people
mean
sometimes
it
is
like
trying
to
imagine
eternity
one
has
nothing
to
go
on
we
went
to
bed
early
but
i
could
sleep
after
what
ben
had
said
i
felt
i
must
see
mother
again
that
night
i
kept
awake
with
great
difficulty
till
i
heard
the
swish
of
her
dress
on
the
stairs
and
then
i
slipped
out
of
bed
and
faced
her
she
was
too
tired
to
scold
she
had
trodden
twice
in
the
hem
of
her
dress
going
when
we
got
into
her
own
room
she
let
her
cloak
slide
off
on
to
the
floor
and
came
out
of
it
like
a
flower
and
looked
awfully
nice
in
her
low
neck
and
bare
arms
oh
my
pretty
little
mother
i
said
i
do
love
you
you
are
just
like
every
one
else
she
answered
me
pettishly
i
not
i
said
but
of
course
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
one
does
love
people
more
in
evening
dress
and
less
in
a
nightgown
did
george
ever
see
you
like
this
i
asked
often
is
he
gone
to
bed
yes
with
a
headache
she
took
a
candle
and
we
went
on
tiptoe
to
his
room
mother
first
taking
off
her
shoes
for
they
would
tap
on
the
parquet
and
make
a
noise
george
was
asleep
he
had
eaten
one
of
his
bananas
and
the
other
was
still
by
the
side
of
his
bed
hold
the
candle
tempe
mother
said
quickly
it
was
that
she
might
go
down
on
her
knees
beside
george
she
then
buried
her
head
in
the
quilt
and
cried
oh
george
i
am
doing
it
for
the
best
i
am
i
am
for
my
poor
neglected
boy
my
poor
ben
she
upset
and
puzzled
me
so
by
alluding
to
ben
after
my
conversation
with
him
that
very
evening
that
i
dropped
a
blob
of
on
the
sheet
near
george
arm
and
i
was
so
afraid
i
had
awakened
him
that
i
at
once
shut
the
i
mean
blew
out
the
candle
and
made
a
horrible
smell
mother
jumped
off
her
knees
as
frightened
as
i
was
father
mack
has
cured
george
quite
of
swearing
and
we
made
a
clean
bolt
of
it
back
to
her
room
where
she
the
candle
and
began
to
get
out
of
her
dress
as
quickly
as
she
could
while
i
sat
in
a
honeypot
on
the
floor
and
kept
my
nightgown
well
round
my
legs
not
to
catch
cold
and
talked
to
her
nicely
so
as
not
to
startle
her
of
course
mother
dear
you
are
doing
it
for
the
best
even
if
it
is
to
run
away
run
away
who
says
i
am
going
to
run
away
george
he
told
you
he
told
lady
scilly
did
he
then
he
deserves
that
i
should
make
it
true
she
laughed
a
laugh
i
did
not
like
at
all
it
was
her
laugh
but
i
have
said
she
was
quite
changed
oh
mother
do
laugh
like
that
you
are
like
the
good
little
girl
in
the
play
who
preaches
down
a
wicked
mother
heart
well
my
dear
i
promise
you
one
thing
i
will
never
run
away
without
you
will
that
be
all
right
that
will
be
all
right
i
answered
much
relieved
for
although
i
am
so
much
more
pally
with
george
and
sorry
for
him
i
do
want
to
be
left
with
him
perhaps
i
shall
be
allowed
to
run
over
in
the
from
boulogne
sometimes
on
a
visit
then
i
could
darn
and
mend
for
him
as
aix
would
not
be
able
to
spare
mother
from
doing
for
him
i
did
not
mention
aix
to
her
i
thought
she
would
rather
tell
me
all
in
her
own
time
i
often
wonder
if
we
three
will
be
happy
in
boulogne
or
wherever
it
is
social
ostracism
takes
you
to
i
fancy
the
inconvenience
of
running
away
is
chiefly
the
want
of
society
that
is
the
only
want
mother
will
not
feel
after
all
those
years
buried
away
in
isleworth
ariadne
is
now
happily
married
so
it
wo
affect
her
though
i
suppose
that
if
this
had
happened
a
year
ago
a
spending
her
days
in
social
ostracism
would
not
have
suited
simon
stiff
relations
it
might
have
prevented
him
from
proposing
i
see
it
all
mother
unselfishly
waited
one
thing
really
troubles
me
why
does
not
mother
do
some
packing
i
hope
that
she
is
not
going
to
run
away
in
that
uncomfortable
style
when
you
only
throw
two
or
three
things
into
a
bag
a
couple
of
bottles
of
and
some
like
laura
in
leeward
i
at
any
rate
have
some
personal
property
and
i
shall
do
very
badly
without
it
in
a
dull
place
like
boulogne
but
i
will
be
patient
whatever
mother
does
is
sure
to
be
right
even
running
away
which
gets
so
dreadfully
condemned
in
novels
george
new
secretary
is
quite
utilitarian
and
devoted
to
him
she
is
not
so
as
christina
aix
says
or
so
charming
george
keeps
her
hard
at
work
typing
his
autobiography
and
does
go
to
see
father
mack
any
more
i
asked
him
why
he
was
off
dear
father
mack
and
he
says
last
time
he
went
to
see
him
it
was
the
father
and
he
saw
a
horrid
sight
he
could
not
think
he
says
of
entrusting
his
salvation
to
a
man
whom
he
had
seen
supping
with
the
utmost
relish
off
a
plateful
of
bullock
eyes
just
like
george
to
be
put
off
his
salvation
by
a
little
thing
like
that
though
i
always
felt
myself
as
if
father
mack
was
not
quite
ascetic
enough
for
a
real
sinner
like
george
tickets
have
come
to
george
for
the
first
night
of
aix
play
george
calls
it
ingomar
which
vexes
aix
because
ingomar
is
a
certain
kind
of
play
that
only
needs
a
pretty
woman
who
ca
act
as
lead
who
your
parthenia
he
asked
him
aix
answered
oh
a
little
woman
i
unearthed
for
myself
from
the
suburban
drama
the
usual
way
any
good
asked
george
casually
i
am
telling
her
exactly
what
i
want
her
to
do
and
she
looks
upon
me
as
shakespeare
and
the
angel
gabriel
in
one
said
aix
glancing
across
at
mother
who
pursed
up
her
lips
and
laughed
i
will
take
tempe
to
your
first
night
said
george
suddenly
a
play
of
jim
aix
for
the
child
first
play
cried
mother
in
a
fright
i
should
think
of
it
children
never
see
impropriety
or
ought
not
to
george
said
but
if
you
do
wish
it
i
will
take
lady
scilly
and
the
fylingdales
instead
it
will
do
the
play
good
it
a
fond
delusion
said
aix
that
the
aristocracy
can
even
damn
a
play
of
course
i
understood
the
impropriety
blind
mother
wanted
me
to
be
free
to
go
away
with
her
and
the
was
to
be
the
night
after
all
i
thought
of
the
crossing
by
the
nine
mail
that
we
should
have
to
do
and
that
i
only
know
of
from
hearsay
and
wondered
why
they
must
choose
such
an
awkward
time
perhaps
we
should
not
after
all
cross
that
night
for
surely
aix
would
want
to
come
before
the
curtain
if
called
and
that
would
possibly
be
till
about
ten
too
late
for
the
train
perhaps
we
should
stay
the
night
at
an
hotel
i
should
simply
love
that
chapter
xxi
shall
i
type
your
to
george
i
asked
mother
she
said
what
do
you
mean
i
said
the
one
you
will
leave
pinned
to
your
pincushion
in
the
usual
place
she
laughed
and
i
again
thought
her
most
fearfully
casual
there
was
no
packing
done
although
one
would
have
thought
she
would
have
liked
her
clothes
nice
and
fresh
and
lots
of
them
so
that
she
should
feel
shabby
at
boulogne
and
let
aix
and
herself
down
as
for
my
clothes
i
really
only
had
one
one
dress
i
mean
and
it
was
hanging
loose
where
it
should
and
with
a
large
in
front
nobody
had
troubled
to
take
out
with
salts
of
lemon
or
anything
but
i
began
to
think
some
things
had
been
sent
on
beforehand
as
advance
luggage
or
so
forth
for
aix
came
in
one
evening
and
when
aunt
gerty
raised
her
eyebrows
at
him
he
said
a
that
i
fancied
was
the
ticket
number
for
the
luggage
so
i
felt
more
at
ease
one
eventful
evening
after
mother
had
been
lying
down
all
day
i
was
told
to
put
on
my
pleated
and
to
mend
it
if
it
wanted
it
i
did
mend
it
and
i
put
a
toothbrush
in
the
pocket
of
it
and
i
kissed
all
the
cats
until
they
hated
me
cats
do
like
kissing
but
then
i
know
when
i
should
see
them
again
i
supposed
some
time
for
running
away
never
is
a
permanent
thing
people
always
come
back
and
take
up
housekeeping
again
in
the
long
run
the
funny
thing
was
they
had
chosen
the
day
of
aix
first
night
to
run
away
on
i
suppose
it
was
in
case
he
was
then
the
manager
could
come
on
and
say
the
author
is
not
in
the
house
having
gone
to
boulogne
with
a
lady
and
little
girl
by
the
nine
mail
that
of
course
was
the
train
we
were
to
catch
i
looked
it
out
i
am
good
at
trains
george
took
lady
scilly
to
dine
at
the
paxton
that
night
and
on
to
the
theatre
where
some
others
were
to
meet
them
i
have
never
been
to
a
theatre
myself
only
music
halls
at
six
george
went
off
all
grin
and
gardenia
the
grin
was
as
forced
as
the
gardenia
i
observed
that
aunt
gerty
badly
wanted
to
go
with
aix
and
hold
his
hand
as
he
was
as
nervous
as
a
cat
but
he
would
have
her
with
him
and
i
wonder
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
shake
her
off
by
nine
and
he
would
have
missed
the
and
mother
and
me
after
our
dinner
mother
went
up
to
her
room
and
put
on
her
hat
and
told
me
to
go
to
mine
and
to
put
on
my
shanter
i
did
intrude
on
her
privacy
i
daresay
she
was
saying
a
long
to
her
old
home
as
i
was
i
filled
my
pockets
with
mementoes
i
took
ernie
fynes
list
of
horses
for
after
all
he
is
the
only
boy
i
ever
loved
and
it
is
my
only
i
wondered
what
mother
would
take
however
she
came
out
of
her
room
smiling
and
her
pockets
did
stick
out
a
bit
she
is
calm
in
the
face
of
danger
just
as
she
was
that
awful
day
when
i
supplied
a
fresh
lot
of
methylated
to
a
dying
flame
under
our
straight
from
the
bottle
and
she
had
to
put
out
the
large
fire
i
had
started
unconsciously
goodness
child
how
you
do
bulge
empty
your
pocket
at
once
i
did
as
i
was
told
we
must
buy
pencils
over
there
i
suppose
but
i
held
on
to
the
toothbrush
now
you
are
not
to
talk
all
the
way
there
and
tire
me
mother
said
as
we
got
into
a
hansom
i
wo
but
do
tell
me
where
we
are
to
meet
mr
aix
aix
i
am
sure
i
do
know
he
will
be
about
i
suppose
unless
they
sit
on
his
head
to
keep
him
quiet
do
talk
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
head
not
because
she
had
a
headache
but
to
keep
her
hair
in
place
as
it
was
a
windy
night
and
i
could
help
thinking
of
the
crossing
that
i
had
never
crossed
only
heard
what
ariadne
said
about
it
when
she
came
back
from
her
ariadne
tried
seven
cures
and
none
of
them
saved
her
it
was
ridiculously
early
only
seven
as
we
drove
on
and
on
i
began
to
hope
that
we
were
going
to
lose
aix
and
go
alone
but
it
was
no
good
we
stopped
at
a
door
that
certainly
was
the
door
of
a
station
and
aix
came
out
to
meet
us
he
squeezed
our
hands
and
his
hand
was
hot
while
his
face
was
as
white
as
a
we
went
in
up
a
dirty
passage
and
into
a
great
cellar
where
there
seemed
to
be
building
constructions
going
on
for
i
noticed
lots
of
scaffolding
and
that
sort
of
thing
there
were
also
great
pieces
of
canvas
stretched
on
wood
and
one
very
big
bit
lying
there
propped
against
the
wall
had
a
landscape
of
an
orchard
on
it
what
is
it
i
asked
one
of
the
people
standing
about
a
man
in
a
white
jacket
that
missie
that
the
back
cloth
to
the
first
scene
and
then
he
mumbled
something
about
flies
and
their
wings
that
i
did
not
chose
to
show
i
did
understand
oh
yes
quite
so
i
said
to
the
dirty
man
in
the
white
it
had
once
been
jacket
and
got
hold
of
aix
who
was
mooning
about
in
evening
dress
quite
unsuitable
for
a
journey
but
he
was
always
an
untidy
sort
of
inappropriate
man
where
my
mother
oh
your
mother
yes
she
gone
to
her
room
i
take
you
to
her
but
are
you
going
to
make
us
live
i
asked
but
bless
the
man
he
was
too
nervous
to
take
any
more
notice
of
me
and
my
remarks
we
muddled
along
i
tumbled
over
a
lump
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
grass
sown
on
it
and
caught
my
foot
in
a
carpet
made
of
the
same
aix
quite
forgot
me
and
i
lost
him
mind
mind
everybody
kept
saying
and
shouldering
past
me
with
bits
of
the
very
walls
in
their
arms
they
left
the
brick
perfectly
bare
as
bare
as
our
old
at
isleworth
the
one
in
cinque
cento
house
is
panelled
i
saw
an
ordinary
tree
as
i
thought
but
i
was
quite
upset
to
find
it
was
flat
like
a
drawing
my
eyes
were
dazzled
with
electric
lights
mounted
on
strings
like
a
necklace
only
stiff
that
they
pushed
about
everywhere
they
liked
there
were
things
like
our
nursery
all
round
the
gas
that
was
there
as
well
as
electric
i
noticed
a
girl
go
and
look
through
a
hole
in
a
bit
of
canvas
or
tapestry
that
took
up
all
one
side
of
the
wall
and
went
near
her
pretty
fair
house
she
said
she
was
a
little
thing
with
hardly
enough
on
and
what
there
was
was
dirty
or
dyed
a
dirty
colour
in
fact
no
two
persons
there
were
dressed
alike
it
was
like
a
party
such
as
the
hitchings
have
at
their
the
noise
was
deafening
they
were
shoving
heavy
weights
about
here
and
there
without
knowing
particularly
or
caring
where
they
were
going
my
new
friend
had
an
american
accent
and
was
as
gentle
as
a
cat
she
went
a
little
way
back
from
the
curtain
with
me
and
stood
by
a
man
she
seemed
rather
to
like
though
he
did
seem
to
like
her
he
was
very
tall
and
big
and
when
she
had
been
talking
to
him
a
little
while
she
said
suddenly
excuse
me
i
must
not
let
myself
get
stiff
and
took
hold
of
a
great
leather
belt
he
wore
and
propped
herself
up
by
it
and
began
to
dip
up
and
down
opening
her
knees
wide
the
man
did
seem
to
like
it
much
but
he
was
kind
and
chaffed
her
till
i
got
tired
of
her
up
and
down
and
talking
of
her
greekness
and
asked
one
or
the
other
of
them
to
be
kind
enough
to
take
me
to
my
mother
certainly
little
said
the
man
kindly
point
the
young
lady
out
to
me
there
so
many
in
the
greek
chorus
it
is
miss
lucy
jennings
daughter
said
somebody
near
i
take
you
to
her
after
my
dance
said
the
girl
wait
watch
me
i
go
on
it
was
a
sort
of
like
a
little
spring
lamb
capering
about
the
fields
and
running
races
with
the
others
as
they
do
but
not
more
than
that
they
made
a
ring
for
her
and
we
all
stood
round
and
watched
her
and
somebody
sang
while
she
was
dancing
she
had
no
stockings
at
all
on
her
clean
manicured
feet
but
a
kind
of
boot
of
fancy
leather
she
came
back
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
and
no
wonder
for
she
had
nearly
stayed
still
not
so
much
exercise
as
an
ordinary
game
of
and
said
to
me
now
pussy
i
will
escort
you
to
your
mommer
she
took
me
to
the
edge
of
the
wall
where
a
little
stairs
came
down
and
on
the
way
we
passed
a
boy
with
one
side
of
him
blue
and
the
other
green
and
another
man
with
wattles
like
a
turkey
hanging
down
his
cheeks
and
a
baby
rattle
in
his
hand
i
hated
them
all
they
were
streaky
and
hot
like
a
nightmare
and
simply
longed
for
my
nice
clean
natural
mother
but
when
we
got
to
a
door
and
knocked
a
woman
like
a
nurse
came
and
answered
it
and
through
her
arm
i
could
see
my
mother
standing
in
front
of
a
under
a
gas
globe
with
a
fender
over
it
and
she
was
streakier
than
anybody
she
had
a
queer
dress
on
too
with
a
waistband
much
too
low
and
a
skirt
shortish
and
her
hair
was
yellow
that
finished
me
and
i
screamed
oh
mother
where
have
you
put
your
black
hair
aunt
gerty
who
was
sitting
on
a
large
cane
told
me
to
shut
my
mouth
and
mother
turned
round
and
said
it
is
only
a
wig
dear
and
the
paint
will
wash
off
and
then
i
will
kiss
you
meantime
sit
down
and
keep
still
so
i
did
and
watched
the
nurse
arranging
mother
as
if
she
was
a
child
nothing
more
or
less
i
turned
this
way
and
that
trying
to
get
the
effect
but
it
was
no
use
i
still
thought
she
looked
horrid
the
others
did
think
so
aunt
gerty
kept
saying
really
lucy
i
would
have
believed
it
a
little
goes
a
long
way
with
us
poor
women
i
see
more
on
the
corner
of
the
cheek
kate
the
lighting
is
rather
unkind
here
i
happen
to
know
so
kate
put
more
on
and
mother
kept
taking
more
off
with
a
shabby
bit
of
an
animal
foot
she
kept
in
her
hand
she
never
looked
at
me
at
all
she
was
much
too
busy
then
suddenly
a
little
scrubby
boy
came
and
said
something
at
the
door
garden
scene
on
and
went
away
the
nurse
called
kate
threw
a
coat
over
mother
and
we
all
three
went
out
and
down
the
stairs
then
for
the
first
time
i
twigged
what
it
was
a
the
people
were
acting
all
round
us
i
knew
acting
well
enough
when
i
saw
it
but
what
i
did
know
was
behind
the
scenes
and
goodness
me
i
have
heard
aunt
gerty
talk
about
it
enough
i
was
ashamed
of
having
been
so
stupid
and
terribly
disillusioned
as
well
the
play
was
all
the
running
away
there
was
to
be
mother
was
going
to
be
no
more
to
aix
than
taking
a
leading
part
in
his
play
amounted
to
my
toothbrush
literally
burned
in
my
pocket
i
had
been
made
a
fool
of
but
when
i
came
to
think
it
over
quietly
i
did
not
know
but
what
i
was
not
rather
glad
it
would
have
been
a
horrid
upset
this
idea
and
i
believe
george
secretly
felt
it
very
much
though
he
did
swagger
so
and
pretend
he
did
care
the
only
thing
was
perhaps
he
would
mind
mother
going
on
the
stage
even
worse
than
running
away
i
longed
to
see
him
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
about
it
aix
was
standing
quite
near
us
between
a
flat
green
tree
and
the
wall
of
a
temple
he
looked
almost
handsome
i
suppose
it
was
the
aroma
of
success
for
certainly
this
a
success
the
audience
seemed
delighted
with
bell
a
great
fat
actor
in
boots
with
frilled
tops
like
an
ancient
roman
who
stood
in
the
very
middle
of
the
stage
raging
away
at
mother
about
something
or
other
she
had
done
bell
in
capital
form
said
aix
quite
loud
pleased
with
him
i
hope
i
shall
content
you
too
said
mother
who
was
shivering
all
over
and
i
do
wonder
for
the
draughts
in
this
place
were
terrific
kate
handed
her
a
bottle
of
better
by
far
have
a
and
said
aix
no
dutch
courage
for
me
thank
you
said
mother
tell
me
at
once
is
george
and
the
cat
in
the
box
they
are
and
sidney
robinson
and
the
countess
of
fylingdales
you
must
buck
up
little
woman
and
show
them
what
you
can
do
and
what
you
can
do
she
answered
politely
i
sha
forget
you
have
entrusted
me
with
your
play
and
by
jove
you
bring
it
out
as
no
other
woman
could
you
can
i
on
said
mother
suddenly
and
shunted
the
shawl
and
pushed
forward
and
began
to
act
they
clapped
her
at
first
and
nearly
drowned
her
voice
but
she
went
right
on
and
abused
bell
in
blank
verse
i
was
glad
aix
made
her
a
laundress
or
a
serio
but
something
nice
and
greek
and
respectable
i
stood
there
with
kate
and
mother
shawl
and
aunt
gerty
and
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
so
excited
before
the
greek
girl
came
up
to
me
and
said
say
your
mommer
knock
them
then
they
seemed
to
come
to
a
sort
of
proper
place
to
stop
and
the
curtain
began
to
rattle
down
and
mother
and
bell
were
holding
each
other
tight
like
lovers
only
i
heard
her
say
in
a
whisper
mind
my
hair
they
stayed
there
a
long
time
looking
stupid
even
while
the
curtain
was
down
and
people
were
clapping
all
round
then
i
saw
why
they
did
it
for
it
went
up
again
and
again
and
then
they
parted
and
took
hands
the
last
time
and
looked
straight
in
front
of
them
and
panted
while
people
shouted
their
names
then
the
curtain
came
down
again
and
bell
limped
off
for
as
he
said
politely
mother
had
been
standing
all
the
while
on
his
best
corn
she
was
so
sorry
and
he
said
it
did
matter
and
he
hoped
he
had
disarranged
her
hair
oddly
enough
the
clapping
began
again
aunt
gerty
jogged
mother
who
stood
near
me
looking
quite
giddy
and
said
take
your
call
silly
bell
took
her
by
the
hand
and
made
her
walk
along
in
front
of
the
curtain
that
a
man
held
back
for
her
by
main
force
and
then
we
heard
the
people
roaring
again
till
it
seemed
more
as
if
they
thirsted
for
their
blood
than
wanted
to
praise
them
this
happened
twice
when
they
did
seem
inclined
to
clap
any
more
she
went
off
to
her
room
with
kate
while
aix
thanked
her
for
making
his
play
come
and
look
at
them
said
aunt
gerty
to
me
and
we
went
and
looked
through
the
rent
in
the
curtain
for
that
was
the
hole
in
the
wall
the
girl
looked
through
there
was
george
and
lady
scilly
talking
away
as
if
mother
and
her
triumph
had
existed
i
think
george
was
cross
but
i
really
could
tell
mother
would
have
me
in
her
room
at
all
this
time
and
i
lounged
about
with
aunt
gerty
till
it
all
began
again
mother
did
do
this
next
act
so
well
at
least
aunt
gerty
said
not
and
scolded
her
i
ca
help
it
gertrude
mother
said
i
thought
george
would
have
never
fear
he
hold
out
till
the
end
of
the
play
then
he
be
round
here
bothering
as
sure
as
my
name
is
gertrude
jenynge
and
her
name
is
gertrude
jennings
which
is
pretty
near
and
in
the
third
piece
of
acting
when
mother
was
not
on
much
i
heard
voice
asking
to
be
taken
to
her
miss
jennings
left
word
she
was
not
to
be
disturbed
this
wait
i
her
husband
very
likely
sir
the
man
sneered
he
did
get
in
and
he
stood
there
neglected
by
the
staircase
till
the
beginning
of
the
next
and
last
act
as
they
said
it
was
i
dared
not
go
and
speak
to
him
for
he
looked
so
cross
and
i
was
also
afraid
he
would
carry
me
away
to
the
box
with
lady
scilly
so
i
just
slipped
behind
a
bit
of
scenery
and
observed
presently
mother
came
softly
out
of
her
room
and
passed
george
leaning
on
the
rail
of
the
staircase
leading
to
her
she
nodded
and
laughed
wait
for
me
george
please
kate
take
this
gentleman
to
my
room
and
she
went
gaily
on
to
the
stage
i
followed
george
and
kate
to
mother
room
and
discovered
myself
to
him
he
made
no
fuss
simply
looked
right
through
me
and
began
walking
up
and
down
while
kate
sewed
a
button
on
to
something
we
heard
the
clapping
from
the
front
quite
distinctly
george
ground
his
teeth
then
kate
slipped
out
and
mother
came
in
alone
panting
and
took
hold
of
the
as
if
she
was
drowning
i
saved
the
piece
said
she
almost
to
herself
and
then
to
george
i
an
artist
oh
george
why
were
you
in
front
to
see
me
in
the
best
moment
of
my
life
when

married

stuttered
yes
but
that
was
nearly
such
an
occasion
oh

said
george
as
if
he
was
disgusted
here

jim
aix
to
congratulate
me
poor
aix
he
is
so
pleased
she
burst
into
tears
as
aix
came
in
he
took
absolutely
no
notice
of
george
but
just
caught
hold
of
mother
hands
and
said
several
times
over

madame
duclaux
is
in
love
with
her
subject
and
brings
to
it
a
mind
full
of
sympathy
an
imagination
quickened
by
knowledge
and
tender
association
and
a
sense
of
beauty
at
once
catholic
penetrating
and
minutely
observant
she
is
also
economic
in
a
large
and
liberal
sense
deeply
versed
in
the
history
of
rural
france
and
in
applying
its
teachings
to
the
study
of
modern
conditions
but
sociology
is
a
very
arid
title
to
give
to
essays
so
instinct
with
life
movement
and
poetry
madame
duclaux
has
much
more
affinity
with
wordsworth
in
his
better
moods
than
with
a
social
science
congress
it
is
its
variety
its
unobtrusive
scholarship
its
wide
range
of
knowledge
the
easy
grace
and
blithe
modulation
of
its
phrasing
the
gentle
kindly
temper
shrewd
insight
and
lively
sensibility
of
the
writer
that
contrive
to
make
it
a
book
to
be
read
with
delight
and
studied
with
profit
everywhere
she
gives
the
sense
of
that
wonderful
world
of
which
seems
fading
from
the
horizon
of
the
modern
there
is
a
reaching
back
to
primitive
things
night
and
silence
the
thrill
and
magic
of
growing
life
all
the
spirit
of
spring
and
harvest
and
in
this
delightful
land
she
shows
the
french
peasant
in
this
rural
life
there
is
the
secret
of
a
civilization
which
has
vanished

the
author
accepts
carlyle
for
a
modern
prophet
for
one
of
the
great
spiritual
teachers
and
leaders
of
the
last
century
and
prophetic
mind
is
traced
in
this
work
to
its
original
fountain
and
home
in
the
burgher
secession
under
the
erskines
as
it
invaded
the
carlyle
country
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
book
is
illustrated
by
nearly
one
hundred
views
places
and
portraits
all
having
some
direct
relation
to
the
carlyles
in
the
carlyle

a

robert
in
mr
snowden
ward
is
probably
the
greatest
living
authority
on
dickens
localities
the
work
has
never
been
done
so
thoroughly
and
comprehensively
as
in
real
dickens
land
a
wonderfully
complete
painstaking
and
accurate
survey
of
every
corner
in
england
which
dickens
visited
and
described
daily
a
very
charmingly
produced
book
a
harvest
of
fine
photographs
many
of
which
will
be
of
enduring
interest
the
sketch
of
dickens
life
and
the
running
commentary
on
the
pictures
themselves
are
excellently
done
and
are
obviously
the
work
of
authors
genuinely
in
love
with
their
subject
and
free
from
the
extravagance
of
undue
hero
worship
sunday
to
our
authors
we
owe
the
happy
thought
of
preserving
with
the
aid
of
their
cameras
the
real
dickens
land
as
it
exists
and
by
faithfully
following
the
footsteps
of
the
novelist
from
boyhood
up
they
have
succeeded
in
giving
us
an
invaluable
picture
gallery
the
handsome
volume
forms
a
distinct
addition
to
dickens
literature
the
authors
have
made
excellent
use
of
the
many
investigations
by
kitton
and
other
indefatigable
dickensians
they
have
themselves
made
research
and
taken
photographs
and
since
they
write
well
their
volume
is
a
model
of
its
kind
the
illustrations
are
numerous
and
excellent
the
index
is
and
the
events
of
dickens
life
are
skilfully
woven
into
the
narrative
norwich
in
short
this
volume
is
without
a
peer
in
the
matter
that
really
illustrates
charles
dickens
life
and
works
and
ward
have
hit
the
happy
mean
so
that
the
book
is
not
a
bald
statement
of
facts
but
is
lightened
by
glimpses
of
art
and
nature
in
her
brightest
moods
wherever
occasion
served
it
can
not
fail
to
be
a

is
a
book
to
read

to
think
about
and
one
which
obviously
proceeds
from
a
great
deal
of
honest
and
stubborn
thinking
on
the
writer
part
it
both
challenges
the
stupidities
of
clever
people

brings
into
sharp
question
the
lazy
conventions

servilities
of

life
no
more
provocative

has
been

this

wells
is
a
master
of
the
suggestive
phrase
which
suddenly
opens
long
vistas

great
issues
in

is
a
courageous
and
earnest
and
suggestive
attempt
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
future
of
the
race
and
as
such
we
hope
it
will
be
widely
read
wells
is
one
of
the
few
very
few
original
thinkers
of
the
present
day
and
the
result
is
that
we
have
a
book
which
stimulates
thought
more
than
any
work

has
come

an
imaginative
writer
of
truly
original
power
but
a
thinker
of
very
considerable
calibre
we
can
not

to
recommend
this
book
to
our
readers
as
one
of
the
most
suggestive
attempts
that
have
yet
been
made
seriously
to
grapple
with
those
great

which
present
themselves
to
every

such
vividness
of
perception
and
picturesque
wealth
of
detail
as
render
it
hard
for
the
most
unwilling
reader
to
evade
its
spell

most
bracing
strenuous
and
interesting
attempt
to
foreshadow
