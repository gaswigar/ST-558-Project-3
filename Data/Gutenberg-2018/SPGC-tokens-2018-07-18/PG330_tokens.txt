chapter
i
i
have
a
warning
when
it
was
all
over
sam
came
out
to
the
to
say
to
me
before
he
and
sam
left
i
hated
to
see
him
go
after
all
we
had
been
through
together
and
i
suppose
he
saw
it
in
my
face
for
he
came
over
close
and
stood
looking
down
at
me
and
smiling
you
saved
us
minnie
he
said
and
i
need
tell
you
we
grateful
but
do
you
know
what
i
think
he
asked
pointing
his
long
forefinger
at
me
i
think
you
enjoyed
it
even
when
you
were
suffering
most
women
are
born
to
intrigue
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
enjoyed
it
i
snapped
i
an
old
woman
before
my
time
sam
what
with
trailing
back
and
forward
through
the
snow
to
the
and
not
getting
to
bed
at
all
some
nights
and
my
heart
going
by
fits
and
starts
as
you
may
say
and
half
the
time
my
spinal
marrow
fairly
chilled
not
to
mention
putting
on
my
overshoes
every
morning
from
force
of
habit
and
having
to
take
them
off
again
i
about
all
in
it
been
the
making
of
you
minnie
he
said
eying
me
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
look
at
your
cheeks
look
at
your
disposition
i
believe
you
stab
anybody
in
the
back
now
which
was
a
joke
of
course
i
never
stabbed
anybody
in
the
back
he
sauntered
over
and
dropped
a
quarter
into
the
by
the
door
but
the
thing
was
frozen
up
and
refused
to
work
i
seen
the
time
when
sam
would
have
kicked
it
but
he
merely
looked
at
it
and
then
at
me
turned
virtuous
like
everything
else
around
the
place
not
that
i
do
approve
of
virtue
minnie
but
i
have
got
used
to
putting
my
foot
on
the
brass
rail
of
the
bar
and
ordering
a
nut
sundae
hook
the
money
out
with
a
hairpin
minnie
and
buy
some
shredded
wheat
in
remembrance
of
me
he
opened
the
door
and
a
blast
of
february
wind
rattled
the
sam
threw
out
his
chest
under
his
sweater
and
waved
me
another
well
i
off
minnie
he
said
take
care
of
yourself
and
do
sit
too
tight
on
the
job
learn
to
rise
a
bit
in
the
saddle
mr
sam
i
called
putting
down
miss
patty
doily
and
following
him
to
the
door
better
have
something
before
you
start
to
keep
you
warm
he
turned
at
the
corner
of
the
path
and
grinned
back
at
me
all
right
he
called
i
go
down
to
the
bar
and
get
a
lettuce
sandwich
then
he
was
gone
and
happy
as
i
was
i
knew
i
would
miss
him
terribly
i
got
a
wire
hairpin
and
went
over
to
the
but
when
i
had
finally
dug
out
the
money
i
could
hardly
see
it
for
tears
it
began
when
the
old
doctor
died
i
suppose
you
have
heard
of
hope
sanatorium
and
the
mineral
spring
that
made
it
famous
perhaps
you
have
seen
the
blotter
we
got
out
with
a
interior
of
the
on
it
and
me
handing
the
old
doctor
a
glass
of
mineral
water
and
wearing
the
embroidered
linen
waist
that
miss
patty
jennings
gave
me
that
winter
the
blotters
were
a
great
success
below
the
picture
it
said
yours
for
health
and
in
the
body
of
the
blotter
in
red
lettering
your
system
absorbs
the
drugs
in
hope
springs
water
as
this
blotter
soaks
up
ink
the
yours
for
health
was
my
idea
i
have
been
girl
at
hope
springs
sanatorium
for
fourteen
years
my
father
had
the
position
before
me
but
he
took
rheumatism
and
as
the
old
doctor
said
it
was
bad
business
policy
to
spend
thousands
of
dollars
in
advertising
that
hope
springs
water
cured
rheumatism
and
then
have
father
creaking
like
a
rusty
hinge
every
time
he
bent
over
to
fill
a
glass
with
it
father
gave
me
one
piece
of
advice
the
day
he
turned
the
over
to
me
it
a
difficult
situation
my
girl
he
said
lots
of
people
think
it
simply
a
matter
of
filling
a
glass
with
water
and
handing
it
over
the
railing
why
i
tell
you
a
barkeeper
a
man
mostly
and
his
job
a
snap
to
this
i
like
to
know
how
a
barkeeper
would
make
out
if
his
customers
came
back
only
once
a
year
and
he
had
to
remember
whether
they
wanted
their
drinks
cold
or
hot
or
off
and
another
thing
if
a
chap
comes
in
with
a
tale
of
woe
does
the
barkeeper
have
to
ask
him
what
he
doing
for
it
and
listen
while
he
tells
how
much
weight
he
lost
in
a
blanket
sweat
no
sir
he
pushes
him
a
bottle
and
lets
it
go
at
that
father
passed
away
the
following
winter
he
been
a
little
bit
delirious
and
his
last
words
were
yes
sir
hot
with
a
pinch
of
salt
sir
poor
father
the
spring
had
been
his
career
you
may
say
and
i
like
to
think
that
perhaps
even
now
he
is
sitting
by
some
everlasting
spring
measuring
out
water
with
a
golden
goblet
instead
of
the
old
tin
dipper
i
said
that
to
sam
once
and
he
said
he
felt
quite
sure
that
i
was
right
and
that
where
father
was
the
water
would
be
appreciated
he
had
heard
of
father
well
for
the
first
year
or
so
i
nearly
went
crazy
then
i
found
things
were
coming
my
way
i
got
the
kind
of
mind
that
never
forgets
a
name
or
face
and
can
combine
them
properly
which
is
common
and
when
folks
came
back
i
could
call
them
at
once
it
would
do
your
heart
good
to
see
some
politician
coming
up
to
rest
his
stomach
from
the
free
bar
in
the
state
house
at
the
capital
enter
the
where
everybody
is
playing
cards
and
drinking
water
and
not
caring
a
rap
whether
he
the
man
that
cleans
the
windows
or
the
secretary
of
the
navy
if
he
been
there
before
in
sixty
seconds
i
have
his
name
on
my
tongue
and
a
glass
of
water
in
his
hand
and
have
asked
him
about
the
rheumatism
in
his
right
knee
and
how
the
children
are
and
in
ten
minutes
he
sitting
in
a
bridge
game
and
trotting
to
the
spring
to
have
his
glass
refilled
during
his
dummy
hand
as
if
he
grown
up
in
the
place
the
old
doctor
used
to
say
my
memory
was
an
asset
to
the
sanatorium
he
depended
on
me
a
good
bit
the
old
doctor
did
and
that
winter
he
was
pretty
feeble
he
was
only
seventy
but
he
got
in
the
habit
of
making
it
eighty
to
show
that
the
mineral
water
kept
him
young
finally
he
got
to
being
eighty
from
thinking
it
and
he
died
of
senility
in
the
end
he
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
the
every
day
to
get
his
morning
glass
of
water
and
read
the
papers
for
a
good
many
years
it
had
been
his
custom
to
sit
there
in
the
winter
by
the
wood
fire
and
in
the
summer
just
inside
the
open
door
and
to
read
off
the
headings
aloud
while
i
cleaned
around
the
spring
and
polished
glasses
i
see
the
president
is
going
fishing
minnie
he
say
or
airbrake
is
up
to
i
wish
i
bought
it
that
time
i
dreamed
about
it
it
was
you
who
persuaded
me
not
to
minnie
and
all
that
winter
with
the
papers
full
of
rumors
that
miss
patty
jennings
was
going
to
marry
a
prince
we
followed
it
by
the
fire
the
old
doctor
and
i
getting
angry
at
the
austrian
emperor
for
opposing
it
when
we
knew
how
much
too
good
miss
patty
was
for
any
foreigner
and
then
getting
nervous
and
fussed
when
we
read
that
the
prince
mother
was
in
favor
of
the
match
and
it
might
go
through
miss
patty
and
her
father
came
every
winter
to
hope
springs
and
i
could
have
been
more
anxious
about
it
if
she
had
been
my
own
sister
well
as
i
say
it
all
began
the
very
day
the
old
doctor
died
he
stamped
out
to
the
with
the
morning
paper
about
nine
and
the
wedding
seemed
to
be
all
off
the
paper
said
the
emperor
had
definitely
refused
his
consent
and
had
sent
the
prince
who
was
his
cousin
for
a
japanese
cruise
while
the
jennings
family
was
going
to
mexico
in
their
private
car
the
old
doctor
was
indignant
and
i
remember
how
he
tramped
up
and
down
the
muttering
that
the
girl
had
had
a
lucky
escape
and
what
did
the
emperor
expect
if
beauty
and
youth
and
wealth
were
enough
but
he
calmed
down
and
soon
he
was
reading
that
the
papers
were
predicting
an
early
spring
and
he
said
we
better
begin
to
increase
our
sulphur
percentage
in
the
water
i
had
noticed
anything
strange
in
his
manner
although
we
all
noticed
how
feeble
he
was
growing
but
when
he
got
up
to
go
back
to
the
sanatorium
and
i
reached
him
his
cane
it
seemed
to
me
he
avoided
looking
at
me
he
went
to
the
door
and
then
turned
and
spoke
to
me
over
his
shoulder
by
the
way
he
remarked
richard
will
be
along
in
a
day
or
so
minnie
you
better
break
it
to
mrs
wiggins
since
the
summer
before
we
had
to
break
dick
coming
to
wiggins
the
housekeeper
owing
to
his
finding
her
false
front
where
it
had
blown
out
of
a
window
having
been
hung
up
to
dry
and
his
wearing
it
to
luncheon
as
whiskers
dick
was
the
old
doctor
grandson
humph
i
said
and
he
turned
around
and
looked
square
at
me
he
a
good
boy
at
heart
minnie
he
said
we
had
our
troubles
with
him
you
and
i
but
everything
has
been
quiet
lately
when
i
did
say
anything
he
looked
discouraged
but
he
had
a
fine
way
of
keeping
on
until
he
gained
his
point
had
the
old
doctor
it
has
been
quiet
has
it
he
demanded
i
do
know
i
said
i
have
been
deaf
since
the
last
explosion
and
i
went
down
the
steps
to
the
spring
i
heard
the
tap
of
his
cane
as
he
came
across
the
floor
and
i
knew
he
was
angry
confound
you
minnie
he
exclaimed
if
i
could
get
along
without
you
i
discharge
you
this
minute
and
if
i
paid
any
attention
to
your
discharging
me
i
have
been
gone
a
dozen
times
in
the
last
year
i
retorted
i
not
objecting
to
dick
coming
here
am
i
only
do
expect
me
to
burst
into
song
about
it
shut
the
door
behind
you
when
you
go
out
but
he
did
go
at
once
he
stood
watching
me
polish
glasses
and
get
the
ready
and
i
knew
he
still
had
something
on
his
mind
minnie
he
said
at
last
you
a
shrewd
young
woman
maybe
more
head
than
heart
but
that
well
enough
and
with
your
temper
under
control
you
a
capable
young
woman
what
has
dick
been
up
to
now
i
asked
growing
suspicious
nothing
but
i
an
old
man
minnie
a
very
old
man
stuff
and
nonsense
i
exclaimed
alarmed
you
only
seventy
what
comes
of
saying
in
the
advertising
that
you
are
eighty
to
show
what
the
springs
have
done
for
you
it
enough
to
make
a
man
die
of
senility
to
have
ten
years
tacked
to
his
age
and
if
he
went
on
if
anything
happens
to
me
minnie
i
counting
on
you
to
do
what
you
can
for
the
old
place
you
been
here
a
good
many
years
minnie
fourteen
years
i
have
been
ladling
out
water
at
this
spring
i
said
trying
to
keep
my
lips
from
trembling
i
would
be
at
home
any
place
else
unless
it
would
be
in
an
aquarium
but
do
ask
me
to
stay
here
and
help
dick
sell
the
old
place
for
a
summer
hotel
for
that
what
he
do
he
wo
sell
it
declared
the
old
doctor
grimly
all
i
want
is
for
you
to
promise
to
stay
oh
i
stay
i
said
i
wo
promise
to
be
agreeable
but
stay
somebody
have
to
look
after
the
spring
i
reckon
dick
thinks
it
comes
out
of
the
earth
just
as
we
sell
it
with
the
whole
pharmacopoeia
in
it
well
it
made
the
old
doctor
happier
and
i
not
sorry
i
promised
but
i
got
a
joint
on
my
right
foot
that
throbs
when
it
is
going
to
rain
or
i
am
going
to
have
bad
luck
and
it
gave
a
jump
then
i
might
have
known
there
was
trouble
ahead
chapter
ii
miss
patty
arrives
it
was
pretty
quiet
in
the
that
day
after
the
old
doctor
left
it
had
started
to
snow
and
only
the
regulars
came
out
what
with
the
old
doctor
talking
about
dying
and
miss
patty
jennings
gone
to
mexico
when
i
been
looking
forward
to
her
and
her
cantankerous
old
father
coming
to
hope
springs
for
february
as
they
mostly
did
i
was
depressed
all
day
i
got
to
the
point
where
moody
feeding
nickels
into
the
with
one
hand
and
eating
zwieback
with
the
other
made
me
nervous
after
a
while
he
went
to
sleep
over
it
and
when
he
had
slipped
a
nickel
in
his
mouth
and
tried
to
put
the
zwieback
in
the
machine
he
muttered
something
and
went
up
to
the
house
i
was
glad
to
be
alone
i
drew
a
chair
in
front
of
the
fire
and
wondered
what
i
would
do
if
the
old
doctor
died
and
what
a
fool
i
been
not
to
be
a
which
is
what
i
studied
for
i
was
thinking
to
myself
bitterly
that
all
that
my
experience
in
the
spring
fitted
me
for
was
to
be
a
mermaid
when
i
heard
something
running
down
the
path
and
it
turned
out
to
be
tillie
the
diet
cook
she
slammed
the
door
behind
her
and
threw
the
finleyville
evening
paper
at
me
there
she
said
i
won
a
cake
of
toilet
soap
from
mike
the
emperor
consented
nonsense
i
snapped
and
snatched
the
paper
tillie
was
right
the
emperor
had
i
sat
down
and
read
it
through
and
there
was
miss
picture
in
an
oval
and
the
prince
in
another
with
a
mustache
and
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
his
sword
and
between
them
both
was
the
austrian
emperor
tillie
came
and
looked
over
my
shoulder
i
not
keen
on
the
mustache
she
said
but
the
beautiful
and
oh
minnie
is
he
aristocratic
look
at
his
nose
but
i
not
one
to
make
up
my
mind
in
a
hurry
and
i
heard
enough
talk
about
foreign
marriages
in
the
years
i
been
dipping
out
mineral
water
to
make
me
a
skeptic
so
to
speak
i
not
so
sure
i
said
slowly
you
ca
tell
anything
by
that
kind
of
a
picture
if
he
was
even
standing
beside
a
chair
i
could
get
a
line
on
him
he
may
be
only
four
feet
high
then
miss
jennings
would
love
him
declared
tillie
how
do
you
reckon
he
makes
his
mustache
point
up
like
that
what
love
got
to
do
with
it
i
demanded
do
be
a
fool
tillie
it
takes
more
than
two
people
pictures
in
a
newspaper
with
a
red
heart
around
them
and
an
overweight
cupid
above
to
make
a
love
a
word
that
used
to
cover
a
good
many
sins
and
to
excuse
them
all
she
is
that
kind
said
tillie
she
she
as
sweet
as
beautiful
and
you
as
excited
as
i
am
minnie
waters
and
if
not
what
have
you
got
the
drinking
glass
she
used
last
winter
put
on
the
top
shelf
out
of
reach
for
she
went
to
the
door
and
slammed
it
open
thank
heaven
i
not
a
old
maid
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
and
when
you
through
hugging
that
paper
you
can
send
it
up
to
the
house
well
i
sat
there
and
thought
it
over
miss
patty
or
miss
patricia
being
so
to
speak
a
friend
of
mine
they
come
to
the
springs
every
winter
for
years
many
a
time
she
slipped
away
from
her
governess
and
come
down
to
the
for
a
chat
with
me
and
we
make
together
by
my
open
fire
and
talk
about
love
and
clothes
and
even
the
tariff
miss
patty
being
for
protection
which
was
natural
seeing
that
was
the
way
her
father
made
his
money
and
i
for
free
trade
especially
in
the
winter
when
my
tips
fall
off
considerable
and
when
she
was
younger
she
would
sit
back
from
the
fire
with
the
on
her
lap
and
her
cheeks
as
red
as
cranberries
and
say
i
do
know
why
i
tell
you
all
these
things
minnie
but
aunt
funny
and
i
ca
talk
to
dorothy
she
too
young
you
know
well
he
said
only
every
winter
it
was
a
different
he
in
my
drawer
i
kept
all
the
clippings
about
her
coming
out
and
the
winter
she
spent
in
washington
and
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
to
the
president
son
and
the
magazine
article
that
told
how
jennings
had
got
his
money
by
robbing
widows
and
orphans
and
showed
the
little
frame
house
where
miss
patty
was
born
as
if
she
had
anything
to
do
with
it
and
so
now
i
was
cutting
out
the
picture
of
her
and
the
prince
and
the
article
underneath
which
told
how
many
castles
she
have
and
i
do
mind
saying
i
was
sniffling
a
little
bit
for
i
could
get
used
to
the
idea
and
suddenly
the
door
closed
softly
and
there
was
a
rustle
behind
me
when
i
turned
it
was
miss
patty
herself
she
saw
the
clipping
immediately
and
stopped
just
inside
the
door
you
too
she
said
and
we
come
all
this
distance
to
get
away
from
just
that
well
i
sha
talk
about
it
i
replied
not
holding
out
my
hand
for
with
her
so
to
speak
next
door
to
being
a
princess
but
she
leaned
right
over
and
kissed
me
i
could
hardly
believe
it
why
wo
you
talk
about
it
she
insisted
catching
me
by
the
shoulders
and
holding
me
off
minnie
your
eyes
are
as
red
as
your
hair
i
do
approve
of
it
i
said
you
might
as
well
know
it
now
as
later
miss
patty
i
do
believe
in
mixed
marriages
i
had
a
cousin
that
married
a
jew
and
what
with
him
making
the
children
promise
to
be
good
on
the
talmud
and
her
trying
to
raise
them
with
the
bible
the
poor
things
is
that
mixed
up
that
it
pitiful
she
got
a
little
red
at
that
but
she
sat
down
and
took
up
the
clipping
he
much
better
looking
than
that
minnie
she
said
soberly
and
he
a
good
catholic
but
if
that
the
way
you
feel
we
not
talk
about
it
i
had
enough
trouble
at
home
as
it
is
i
guess
from
that
your
father
is
crazy
about
it
i
remarked
getting
her
a
glass
of
spring
water
the
papers
had
been
full
of
how
jennings
had
forbidden
the
prince
the
house
when
he
had
been
in
america
the
summer
before
certainly
he
crazy
about
it
almost
insane
she
said
and
smiled
at
me
in
her
old
way
over
the
top
of
the
glass
then
she
put
down
the
glass
and
came
over
to
me
minnie
minnie
she
said
if
you
only
knew
how
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
newspapers
and
the
gossips
and
come
to
this
smelly
little
and
talk
things
over
with
a
girl
and
with
that
i
began
to
blubber
and
she
came
into
my
arms
like
a
baby
you
all
i
got
i
declared
over
and
over
and
you
going
to
live
in
a
country
where
they
harness
women
with
dogs
and
you
never
hear
an
english
word
from
morning
to
night
stuff
she
gave
me
a
little
shake
he
speaks
as
good
english
as
i
do
and
now
we
going
to
stop
talking
about
him
you
worse
than
the
newspapers
she
took
off
her
things
and
going
into
my
closet
began
to
rummage
for
the
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
get
away
she
sang
out
to
me
we
supposed
to
have
gone
to
mexico
even
dorothy
know
where
the
or
the
or
whatever
you
call
it
she
was
as
happy
to
have
escaped
the
reporters
and
the
people
she
knew
as
a
child
and
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
fire
and
began
to
shell
the
corn
into
the
popper
as
if
she
done
it
only
the
day
before
i
guess
you
safe
enough
here
i
said
it
always
slack
in
january
only
a
few
chronics
and
the
husbands
except
a
drummer
now
and
then
who
drives
up
from
finleyville
it
too
early
for
drooping
society
buds
and
the
chronic
livers
do
get
around
until
late
march
after
the
banquet
season
closes
it
will
be
pretty
quiet
for
a
while
and
at
that
minute
the
door
was
flung
open
and
mike
staggered
in
the
old
doctor
he
gasped
he
dead
miss
minnie
died
just
now
in
the
hot
room
in
the
bathhouse
one
minute
he
was
givin
me
the
divil
for
something
or
other
and
the
next
i
thought
he
was
asleep
something
that
had
been
heavy
in
my
breast
all
afternoon
suddenly
seemed
to
burst
and
made
me
feel
faint
all
over
but
i
did
lose
my
head
does
anybody
know
yet
i
asked
quickly
he
shook
his
head
then
he
did
die
in
the
mike
i
said
firmly
he
died
in
his
bed
and
you
know
it
if
it
gets
out
that
he
died
in
the
hot
room
i
have
the
coroner
on
you
miss
patty
was
standing
by
the
railing
of
the
spring
i
got
my
shawl
and
started
out
after
mike
and
she
followed
if
the
guests
ever
get
hold
of
this
they
stampede
start
any
excitement
in
a
sanatorium
i
said
and
one
and
all
they
dip
their
thermometers
in
hot
water
and
swear
they
got
fever
and
we
hurried
to
the
house
together
chapter
iii
a
will
well
we
got
the
poor
old
doctor
moved
back
to
his
room
and
had
one
of
the
chambermaids
find
him
there
and
i
wired
to
van
alstyne
who
was
dicky
carter
sister
and
who
was
on
her
honeymoon
in
south
carolina
the
van
alstynes
came
back
at
once
in
very
bad
tempers
and
we
had
the
funeral
from
the
preacher
house
in
finleyville
so
as
not
to
harrow
up
the
sanatorium
people
any
more
than
necessary
even
as
it
was
a
few
left
but
about
twenty
of
the
chronics
stayed
and
it
looked
as
if
we
might
be
able
to
keep
going
miss
patty
sent
to
town
for
a
black
veil
for
me
and
even
went
to
the
funeral
it
helped
to
take
my
mind
off
my
troubles
to
think
who
it
was
that
was
holding
my
hand
and
comforting
me
and
when
toward
the
end
of
the
service
she
got
out
her
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
eyes
i
was
almost
overcome
she
being
so
to
speak
in
the
very
shadow
of
a
throne
after
it
was
all
over
the
relatives
gathered
in
the
sun
parlor
of
the
sanatorium
to
hear
the
will
van
alstyne
and
his
wife
and
about
twenty
more
who
had
come
up
from
the
city
for
the
funeral
and
stayed
over
on
the
house
well
the
old
doctor
left
me
the
buttons
for
his
full
dress
waistcoat
and
his
favorite
copy
of
gray
anatomy
i
could
exactly
set
up
housekeeping
with
my
share
of
the
estate
but
when
the
lawyer
read
that
part
of
the
will
aloud
and
a
grin
went
around
the
room
i
flounced
out
of
my
chair
maybe
you
think
i
disappointed
i
said
looking
hard
at
the
family
who
were
making
any
particular
pretense
at
grief
and
at
the
house
people
standing
around
the
door
maybe
you
think
it
funny
to
see
an
unmarried
woman
get
a
set
of
waistcoat
buttons
and
a
medical
book
well
that
set
of
buttons
was
the
set
he
bought
in
london
on
his
wedding
trip
and
the
book
the
one
he
read
himself
to
sleep
with
every
night
for
twenty
years
i
proud
to
get
them
van
alstyne
touched
me
on
the
arm
everybody
knows
how
loyal
you
been
minnie
he
assured
me
now
sit
down
like
a
good
girl
and
listen
to
the
rest
of
the
will
while
i
up
i
might
as
well
get
something
else
off
my
mind
i
said
i
know
what
in
that
will
but
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
van
alstyne
he
took
advantage
of
my
being
laid
up
with
influenza
last
spring
they
thought
that
was
funny
but
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
so
cheerful
you
see
the
sanatorium
was
a
mighty
fine
piece
of
property
with
a
deer
park
and
golf
links
we
had
plenty
of
offers
to
sell
it
for
a
summer
hotel
but
we
both
been
dead
against
it
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
will
the
whole
estate
was
left
to
dicky
carter
who
had
been
able
to
come
owing
to
his
being
laid
up
with
an
attack
of
mumps
the
family
sat
up
and
nodded
at
one
another
or
held
up
its
hands
but
when
they
heard
there
was
a
condition
they
breathed
easier
beginning
with
one
week
after
the
reading
of
the
will
and
not
a
day
later
dick
was
to
take
charge
of
the
sanatorium
and
to
stay
there
for
two
months
without
a
day
off
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
place
was
being
successfully
conducted
and
could
show
that
it
had
lost
money
the
entire
property
became
his
for
keeps
if
he
failed
it
was
to
be
sold
and
the
money
given
to
charity
you
would
have
to
know
richard
carter
to
understand
the
excitement
the
will
caused
most
of
us
i
reckon
like
the
sort
of
person
we
never
dared
to
be
ourselves
the
old
doctor
had
gone
to
bed
at
ten
all
his
life
and
got
up
at
seven
and
so
he
had
a
sneaking
fondness
for
the
one
particular
grandson
who
often
did
go
to
bed
at
all
twice
to
my
knowledge
when
he
was
in
his
teens
did
dicky
carter
run
away
from
school
and
twice
his
grandfather
kept
him
for
a
week
hidden
in
the
on
the
golf
links
naturally
when
van
alstyne
and
i
had
to
hide
him
again
which
is
further
on
in
the
story
he
went
to
the
old
like
a
dog
to
its
kennel
only
this
time
but
ahead
too
well
the
family
went
back
to
town
in
a
buzz
of
indignation
and
i
carried
my
waistcoat
buttons
and
my
anatomy
out
to
the
and
had
a
good
cry
there
was
a
man
named
thoburn
who
was
crazy
for
the
property
as
a
summer
hotel
and
every
time
i
shut
my
eyes
i
could
see
thoburn
house
over
the
veranda
and
children
sailing
paper
boats
in
the
mineral
spring
sure
enough
the
next
afternoon
thoburn
drove
out
from
finleyville
with
a
suit
case
and
before
he
taken
off
his
overcoat
he
came
out
to
the
hello
minnie
he
exclaimed
does
the
old
man
ghost
come
back
to
dope
the
spring
or
do
you
do
it
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
thoburn
i
retorted
sharply
if
you
do
know
that
this
spring
has
its
origin
in
in
schmidt
drug
store
down
in
finleyville
he
finished
for
me
oh
i
know
all
about
that
spring
minnie
do
forget
that
my
cows
used
to
drink
that
water
and
liked
it
i
leave
it
to
you
he
said
sniffing
if
a
cow
would
die
of
thirst
before
she
drank
that
stuff
as
it
is
now
i
been
filling
him
a
glass
it
being
a
matter
of
habit
with
me
and
he
took
it
to
the
window
and
held
it
to
the
light
you
getting
careless
minnie
he
said
squinting
at
it
some
of
those
drugs
ought
to
be
dissolved
first
in
hot
water
there
a
lump
of
lithia
there
that
has
schmidt
pharmacy
label
on
it
where
i
demanded
and
started
for
it
he
laughed
at
that
and
putting
the
glass
down
he
came
over
and
stood
smiling
at
me
as
ingenuous
as
a
child
he
said
in
his
mocking
way
a
nice
little
child
minnie
how
old
is
this
young
carter
an
er
earnest
youth
willing
to
buckle
down
to
work
and
make
the
old
place
go
ready
to
pat
the
old
ladies
on
the
shoulder
and
squeeze
the
young
ones
hands
he
young
i
said
but
if
you
counting
on
his
being
a
fool
not
at
all
he
broke
in
hastily
if
he
has
too
much
character
he
probably
succeed
i
hope
he
is
a
fool
if
he
is
oh
friend
minnie
he
stand
the
atmosphere
of
this
garden
of
souls
for
about
a
week
and
then
he
kill
some
of
them
and
escape
where
is
he
now
he
been
sick
i
said
mumps
mumps
oh
my
aunt
he
exclaimed
and
fell
to
laughing
he
was
still
laughing
when
he
got
to
the
door
mumps
he
repeated
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
minnie
the
old
place
will
be
under
the
hammer
in
three
weeks
and
if
you
know
what
good
for
you
you
sign
in
under
the
new
management
while
there
a
vacancy
you
been
the
whole
show
here
for
so
long
that
it
will
be
hard
for
you
to
line
up
in
the
back
row
of
the
chorus
if
i
were
you
i
said
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
i
pick
out
any
new
carpets
yet
thoburn
i
promised
the
old
doctor
help
dick
and
i
will
so
you
actually
going
to
fight
it
out
he
said
grinning
well
the
odds
are
in
your
favor
you
are
two
to
my
one
i
think
it
pretty
even
i
retorted
we
will
be
hindered
so
to
speak
by
having
certain
principles
of
honor
and
honesty
you
have
no
handicap
he
tried
to
think
of
a
retort
and
not
finding
one
he
slammed
out
of
the
in
a
rage
van
alstyne
and
his
wife
came
in
that
same
day
just
before
dinner
and
we
played
bridge
for
half
an
hour
as
i
said
been
on
their
honeymoon
and
they
were
both
sulky
at
having
to
stay
at
the
springs
it
was
particularly
hard
on
van
alstyne
because
with
seven
trunks
of
trousseau
with
her
she
had
to
put
on
black
but
she
used
to
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
in
the
evenings
and
deck
out
for
sam
in
her
best
things
we
found
it
out
one
evening
when
biggs
set
fire
to
her
bureau
cover
with
her
alcohol
heater
and
sam
who
had
been
going
around
in
a
black
crepe
dress
all
day
rushed
out
in
pink
satin
with
crystal
trimming
and
slippers
with
heels
after
the
first
rubber
van
alstyne
threw
her
cards
on
the
floor
and
said
another
day
like
this
would
finish
her
surely
dick
is
able
to
come
now
she
said
like
a
peevish
child
did
he
say
the
swelling
was
all
gone
do
you
expect
me
to
pick
up
those
cards
sam
asked
angrily
looking
at
her
sam
yawned
and
looked
up
at
him
of
course
i
do
she
answered
if
it
was
for
you
i
not
have
stayed
a
moment
after
the
funeral
is
it
bad
enough
to
have
seven
trunks
full
of
clothes
i
never
worn
and
to
have
to
put
on
poky
old
black
without
keeping
me
here
in
this
old
ladies
home
sam
looked
at
the
cards
and
then
at
her
i
not
going
to
pick
them
up
he
declared
and
as
to
our
staying
here
do
you
realize
that
if
we
do
your
precious
brother
will
never
show
up
here
at
all
or
stay
if
he
does
come
and
do
you
also
realize
that
this
is
probably
the
only
chance
he
ever
have
in
the
world
to
become
financially
independent
of
us
you
need
be
brutal
she
said
sharply
and
it
is
so
bad
for
you
here
as
it
is
for
me
you
spend
every
waking
minute
admiring
miss
jennings
while
i
there
is
a
man
in
the
place
who
talk
anything
but
his
joints
or
his
stomach
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
and
sam
followed
her
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
me
in
the
i
a
part
of
it
like
the
brass
rail
around
the
spring
or
the
clock
i
not
admiring
miss
jennings
he
corrected
i
sympathizing
dear
she
looks
too
nice
a
girl
to
have
been
stung
by
the
title
bee
all
she
turned
her
back
to
him
but
he
pretended
to
tuck
the
hair
at
the
back
of
her
neck
up
under
her
comb
and
she
let
him
do
it
as
i
stooped
to
gather
up
the
cards
he
kissed
the
tip
of
her
ear
listen
he
said
there
a
scream
of
a
play
down
at
finleyville
called
sweet
peas
senator
biggs
and
the
bishop
went
down
last
night
and
they
say
it
the
worst
in
twenty
years
put
on
a
black
veil
and
let
slip
away
and
see
it
i
think
she
agreed
to
do
it
but
that
night
after
dinner
amanda
king
who
has
charge
of
the
news
stand
told
me
the
sheriff
had
closed
the
and
that
the
leading
woman
was
sick
at
the
hotel
they
say
she
looked
funny
last
night
amanda
finished
and
i
guess
she
got
the
mumps
mumps
my
joint
gave
a
throb
at
that
minute
chapter
iv
and
a
way
sam
was
taking
any
chances
for
the
next
day
he
went
to
the
city
himself
to
bring
dick
up
everything
was
quiet
that
day
and
the
day
after
except
that
on
the
second
day
i
had
a
difference
of
opinion
with
the
house
doctor
and
he
left
the
story
of
the
will
had
got
out
of
course
and
the
guests
were
waiting
to
see
dick
come
and
take
charge
i
got
a
good
bit
of
gossip
from
miss
cobb
who
had
had
her
hair
cut
short
after
a
fever
and
used
to
come
out
early
in
the
morning
and
curl
it
all
over
her
head
heating
the
curler
on
the
fire
log
i
never
smell
burnt
hair
that
i
do
think
of
miss
cobb
trying
to
do
the
back
of
her
neck
she
was
one
of
our
regulars
and
every
winter
for
ten
years
she
read
me
the
letters
she
had
got
from
an
insurance
agent
who
run
away
with
a
married
woman
the
day
before
the
wedding
she
kept
them
in
a
bundle
tied
with
lavender
ribbon
it
was
on
the
third
day
i
think
that
miss
cobb
told
me
that
miss
patty
and
her
father
had
had
a
quarrel
the
day
before
she
got
it
from
one
of
the
chambermaids
jennings
was
a
liver
case
and
not
pleasant
at
any
time
but
he
had
been
worse
than
usual
annie
the
chambermaid
told
miss
cobb
that
the
trouble
was
about
settlements
and
that
the
more
miss
patty
tried
to
tell
him
it
was
the
european
custom
the
worse
he
got
miss
patty
had
come
down
to
breakfast
that
day
and
moody
and
senator
biggs
made
a
wager
in
the
turkish
bath
according
to
miss
cobb
moody
betting
the
wedding
would
come
off
at
all
of
course
miss
cobb
said
wetting
her
finger
and
trying
the
iron
to
see
if
it
was
hot
of
course
minnie
they
not
married
yet
and
if
father
jennings
gets
ugly
and
makes
any
sort
of
scandal
it
all
off
a
scandal
just
now
would
be
fatal
these
royalties
are
very
touchy
about
other
people
reputations
well
i
heard
that
often
enough
in
the
next
few
days
sam
had
come
back
by
the
morning
of
the
sixth
day
but
he
wired
his
wife
the
day
before
that
dick
was
on
the
way
but
we
met
every
train
with
a
sleigh
and
he
did
come
i
was
uneasy
knowing
dick
and
sam
was
worried
too
by
that
time
everybody
was
waiting
and
watching
and
on
the
early
train
on
the
sixth
day
came
the
lawyer
a
stitt
thoburn
was
going
around
with
a
sort
of
greasy
smile
and
if
i
could
have
poisoned
him
safely
i
have
done
it
it
had
been
snowing
hard
for
a
day
or
so
and
at
eleven
that
day
i
saw
miss
cobb
and
biggs
coming
down
the
path
to
the
biggs
with
her
hanging
to
the
handle
of
her
umbrella
i
opened
the
door
but
they
would
come
in
we
wo
track
up
your
clean
floor
minnie
biggs
said
she
was
a
little
woman
almost
fifty
who
gone
through
life
convinced
she
only
lived
so
long
by
the
care
she
took
of
herself
but
i
thought
i
better
come
and
speak
to
you
please
do
irritate
biggs
he
been
reading
that
article
of
upton
sinclair
about
fasting
and
has
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
noon
yesterday
i
noticed
then
that
she
looked
pale
she
was
a
nervous
creature
although
she
could
drink
more
spring
water
than
any
human
being
i
ever
saw
except
one
man
and
he
was
a
german
well
i
promised
to
be
careful
i
seen
them
fast
before
and
when
a
fat
man
starts
to
live
on
his
own
fat
like
a
bear
he
gets
about
the
same
disposition
biggs
started
back
but
miss
cobb
waited
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
van
alstyne
is
back
she
said
but
he
came
alone
alone
i
repeated
staring
at
her
in
a
sort
of
daze
alone
she
said
solemnly
and
i
heard
him
ask
for
carter
it
seems
he
started
for
here
yesterday
but
i
had
time
to
get
myself
in
hand
and
if
i
had
a
chill
up
my
spine
she
never
knew
it
as
she
started
after
biggs
i
saw
sam
hurrying
down
the
path
toward
the
and
i
knew
my
joint
had
throbbed
for
nothing
sam
came
in
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
what
this
about
dick
not
being
here
he
shouted
well
he
is
that
all
there
is
to
it
van
alstyne
i
said
calmly
i
am
always
calm
when
other
people
get
excited
for
that
reason
some
people
think
my
red
hair
is
a
false
alarm
but
they
soon
find
out
but
he
must
be
here
said
van
alstyne
i
put
him
on
the
train
myself
yesterday
and
waited
until
it
started
to
be
sure
he
was
off
the
only
way
to
get
richard
anywhere
you
want
him
to
go
i
said
dryly
is
to
have
him
nailed
in
a
crate
and
labeled
damned
young
scamp
said
van
alstyne
although
i
have
a
sign
in
the
profanity
not
allowed
exactly
what
was
he
doing
when
you
last
laid
eyes
on
him
i
asked
he
was
on
the
train
was
he
alone
yes
sitting
no
standing
what
the
deuce
minnie
waving
out
the
window
to
you
of
course
not
exclaimed
van
alstyne
testily
he
was
raising
the
window
for
a
girl
in
the
next
seat
precisely
i
said
would
you
know
the
girl
well
enough
to
trace
her
that
ridiculous
you
know
he
said
trying
to
be
polite
out
of
a
thousand
and
one
things
that
may
have
detained
him
only
one
thing
ever
detains
dick
and
that
always
detains
him
i
said
solemnly
that
a
girl
you
a
newcomer
in
the
family
van
alstyne
you
do
remember
the
time
he
went
down
here
to
the
station
to
see
his
aunt
agnes
off
to
the
city
and
we
found
him
three
weeks
later
in
oklahoma
trying
to
marry
a
widow
with
five
children
van
alstyne
dropped
into
a
chair
and
through
force
of
habit
i
gave
him
a
glass
of
spring
water
this
was
a
pretty
girl
too
he
said
dismally
i
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
father
crayon
enlargement
over
the
mantel
shook
its
head
at
me
after
a
minute
van
alstyne
drank
the
water
and
got
up
i
have
to
tell
my
wife
he
said
who
running
the
place
anyhow
you
not
exactly
i
explained
but
of
course
when
anything
comes
up
they
consult
me
the
housekeeper
is
a
fool
and
now
that
the
house
doctor
gone
gone
who
looking
after
the
patients
well
most
of
them
have
been
here
before
i
explained
and
i
know
their
treatment
the
kind
of
baths
and
all
that
oh
you
know
the
treatment
he
said
eying
me
and
why
did
the
house
doctor
go
he
ordered
moody
to
take
his
spring
water
hot
moody
spring
water
has
been
ordered
cold
for
eleven
years
and
i
refused
to
change
it
was
between
the
doctor
and
me
van
alstyne
oh
of
course
he
said
if
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
he
stopped
and
then
something
seemed
to
strike
him
i
say
he
said
about
the
doctor
that
all
right
you
know
lots
of
doctors
and
all
that
but
for
heaven
sake
minnie
do
discharge
the
cook
now
that
was
queer
for
it
had
been
running
in
my
head
all
morning
that
in
the
slack
season
it
would
be
cheaper
to
get
a
good
woman
instead
of
the
chef
and
let
tillie
the
diet
cook
make
the
pastry
sam
picked
up
his
hat
and
looked
at
his
watch
eleven
thirty
he
said
and
no
sign
of
that
puppy
yet
i
guess
up
to
the
police
if
there
was
only
something
to
do
i
said
with
a
lump
in
my
throat
but
to
have
to
sit
and
do
nothing
while
the
old
place
dies
it
awful
van
alstyne
we
not
dead
yet
he
replied
from
the
door
and
maybe
we
need
you
before
the
day
over
if
anybody
can
sail
the
old
bark
to
shore
you
can
do
it
minnie
you
been
steering
it
for
years
the
old
doctor
was
no
navigator
and
you
and
i
know
it
it
was
blowing
a
blizzard
by
that
time
and
miss
patty
was
the
only
one
who
came
out
to
the
until
after
three
she
shook
the
snow
off
her
furs
and
stood
by
the
fire
looking
at
me
and
not
saying
anything
for
fully
a
minute
well
she
said
finally
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
why
i
asked
and
swallowed
hard
to
be
in
all
this
trouble
and
not
let
me
know
i
just
this
minute
heard
about
it
ca
we
get
the
police
van
alstyne
is
trying
i
said
but
i
do
hope
much
like
as
not
dick
will
turn
up
tomorrow
and
say
his
calendar
was
a
day
slow
i
gave
her
a
glass
of
water
and
i
noticed
when
she
took
it
how
pale
she
was
but
she
held
it
up
and
smiled
over
it
at
me
here
to
everything
turning
out
better
than
we
expect
she
said
and
made
a
face
as
she
drank
the
water
i
thought
that
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
troubles
as
well
as
mine
for
she
put
down
the
glass
and
stood
looking
at
her
engagement
ring
a
square
red
ruby
in
an
setting
it
was
a
very
large
ruby
but
i
seen
showier
rings
there
is
anything
wrong
miss
patty
is
there
i
asked
and
she
dropped
her
hand
and
looked
at
me
oh
no
she
said
that
is
nothing
much
minnie
father
is
i
think
he
rather
ridiculous
about
some
things
but
i
dare
say
he
come
around
i
do
mind
his
fussing
with
me
but
if
it
should
get
in
the
papers
minnie
a
breath
of
unpleasant
notoriety
now
would
be
fatal
i
do
see
why
i
said
sharply
the
royal
families
of
europe
have
a
good
bit
of
unpleasant
notoriety
themselves
occasionally
i
should
think
they
fall
over
themselves
to
get
some
good
red
american
blood
blue
blood
bad
blood
you
can
ask
any
doctor
but
she
only
smiled
you
like
father
minnie
she
said
you
never
understand
i
not
sure
i
want
to
i
snapped
and
fell
to
polishing
glasses
the
storm
stopped
a
little
at
three
and
most
of
the
guests
waded
down
through
the
snow
for
bridge
and
spring
water
by
that
time
the
afternoon
train
was
in
and
no
dick
sam
was
keeping
the
lawyer
stitt
in
the
billiard
room
and
by
four
they
had
everything
that
was
in
the
bar
and
were
inventing
new
combinations
of
their
own
and
sam
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
nervous
headache
senator
biggs
brought
the
mail
down
to
the
at
four
but
there
was
nothing
for
me
except
a
note
from
sam
rather
shaky
which
said
he
no
word
yet
and
that
stitt
had
mixed
all
the
cordials
in
the
bar
in
a
beer
glass
and
had
had
to
go
to
bed
at
half
past
four
thoburn
came
out
for
a
minute
he
said
there
was
only
one
other
train
from
town
that
night
and
the
chances
were
it
would
be
snowed
up
at
the
junction
better
get
on
the
band
wagon
before
the
parade
gone
past
he
said
in
an
undertone
but
i
went
into
my
pantry
and
shut
the
door
with
a
slam
and
when
i
came
out
he
was
gone
i
nearly
went
crazy
that
afternoon
i
put
salt
in
miss
cobb
glass
when
she
always
drank
the
water
plain
once
i
put
the
broom
in
the
fire
and
started
to
sweep
the
porch
with
a
fire
log
luckily
they
were
busy
with
their
letters
and
it
went
unnoticed
the
smell
of
burning
straw
not
rising
so
to
speak
above
the
sulphur
in
the
spring
senator
biggs
went
from
one
table
to
another
telling
how
well
he
felt
since
he
stopped
eating
and
trying
to
coax
the
other
men
to
starve
with
him
it
funny
how
a
man
with
a
theory
about
his
stomach
is
happy
until
he
has
made
some
other
fellow
swallow
it
well
he
said
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
with
a
glass
of
water
in
his
hand
it
worth
while
to
feel
like
this
my
head
as
clear
as
a
bell
i
do
care
to
eat
i
do
want
to
eat
the
is
the
solution
two
stages
to
that
solution
senator
said
the
bishop
first
resolution
last
dissolution
then
they
all
began
at
once
if
you
have
ever
heard
twenty
people
airing
their
theories
on
diet
you
know
all
about
it
one
shouts
for
horace
fletcher
and
another
one
swears
by
the
treatment
and
somebody
else
never
touches
a
thing
but
raw
eggs
and
milk
and
pretty
soon
there
is
a
riot
of
calories
and
carbohydrates
it
always
ends
the
same
way
the
man
with
the
loudest
voice
wins
and
the
defeated
ones
limp
over
to
the
spring
and
tell
their
theories
to
me
they
know
being
paid
to
listen
on
this
particular
afternoon
the
bishop
stopped
the
riot
by
rising
and
holding
up
his
hand
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
let
us
not
be
rancorous
if
each
of
us
has
a
theory
and
that
theory
works
out
to
his
satisfaction
then
why
are
we
all
here
merely
to
tell
one
another
the
good
news
jennings
said
sourly
from
his
corner
honest
it
was
funny
if
some
folks
were
healthy
they
be
lonesome
but
when
things
had
got
quiet
except
moody
dropping
nickels
into
the
i
happened
to
look
over
at
miss
patty
and
i
saw
there
was
something
wrong
she
had
a
letter
open
in
her
lap
not
one
of
the
blue
ones
with
the
black
and
gold
seal
that
every
one
in
the
house
knew
came
from
the
prince
but
a
white
one
and
she
was
staring
at
it
as
if
she
seen
a
ghost
chapter
v
wanted
an
owner
i
have
never
reproached
miss
patty
but
if
she
had
only
given
me
the
letter
to
read
or
had
told
me
the
whole
truth
instead
of
a
part
of
it
i
would
have
understood
and
things
would
all
have
been
different
it
is
all
very
well
for
her
to
say
that
i
looked
worried
enough
already
and
that
anyhow
it
was
a
family
affair
i
should
have
been
told
all
she
did
was
to
come
up
to
me
as
i
stood
in
the
spring
with
her
face
perfectly
white
and
ask
me
if
my
dicky
carter
was
the
richard
carter
who
stayed
at
the
grosvenor
in
town
he
does
stay
anywhere
i
said
with
my
feet
getting
cold
but
that
where
he
has
apartments
what
has
he
been
doing
now
you
expecting
him
on
the
evening
train
are
you
she
asked
do
stare
like
that
my
father
watching
he
ought
to
be
on
the
evening
train
i
said
i
was
going
to
say
i
expected
him
i
did
listen
minnie
she
said
you
have
to
send
him
away
again
the
moment
he
comes
he
must
not
go
into
the
house
i
stood
looking
at
her
with
my
mouth
open
not
go
into
the
house
i
repeated
with
everybody
waiting
for
him
for
the
last
six
days
and
stitt
here
to
turn
things
over
to
him
she
stood
tapping
her
foot
with
her
pretty
brows
knitted
the
wretch
she
cried
the
hateful
creature
as
if
things
were
bad
enough
i
suppose
he
have
to
come
minnie
but
i
must
see
him
before
he
sees
any
one
else
just
then
the
bishop
brought
his
glass
over
to
the
spring
hot
this
time
minnie
he
said
do
you
know
i
getting
the
habit
patty
i
afraid
plain
water
will
have
no
attraction
for
me
after
this
he
put
his
hand
over
hers
on
the
rail
they
were
old
friends
the
bishop
and
the
jenningses
well
how
goes
it
with
the
father
he
said
in
a
low
tone
and
smiling
miss
patty
shrugged
her
shoulders
worse
if
possible
i
thought
so
he
said
cheerfully
if
state
of
mind
is
any
criterion
i
should
think
he
has
had
a
relapse
a
little
salt
minnie
miss
patty
stood
watching
him
while
he
tasted
it
bishop
she
said
suddenly
will
you
do
something
for
me
i
always
have
patty
he
was
very
fond
of
miss
patty
was
the
bishop
then
not
later
than
eight
get
father
to
play
cribbage
will
you
and
keep
him
in
the
until
nine
another
escapade
he
said
pretending
to
be
very
serious
patty
patty
you
be
the
death
of
me
yet
is
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
thing
certainly
not
said
miss
patty
just
a
dear
slightly
bald
but
still
very
distinguished
slave
the
bishop
picked
up
her
left
hand
and
looked
at
the
ring
and
from
that
to
her
face
there
will
be
plenty
of
slaves
to
kiss
this
little
hand
where
you
are
going
my
child
he
said
sometimes
i
wish
that
some
nice
boy
here
at
home
but
i
dare
say
it
will
turn
out
surprisingly
well
as
it
is
bishop
bishop
moody
called
how
naughty
of
you
and
with
your
bridge
hand
waiting
to
be
held
he
carried
his
glass
back
to
the
table
stopping
for
a
moment
beside
jennings
if
patty
becomes
any
more
beautiful
he
said
i
shall
be
in
favor
of
having
her
wear
a
mask
how
are
we
young
men
to
protect
ourselves
pretty
is
as
pretty
does
declared
jennings
from
behind
his
newspaper
and
miss
patty
went
out
with
her
chin
up
well
i
knew
dick
had
been
up
to
some
mischief
i
had
suspected
it
all
along
but
miss
patty
went
to
bed
and
old
hutchins
who
a
sort
of
of
hers
said
she
must
be
disturbed
i
was
pretty
nearly
sick
myself
and
when
sam
came
out
at
five
and
said
he
been
in
the
telephone
booth
for
an
hour
and
had
called
everybody
who
had
ever
known
dick
and
that
he
had
dropped
right
off
the
earth
i
just
about
gave
up
he
had
got
some
detectives
he
said
and
there
was
some
sort
of
a
story
about
his
having
kept
right
on
the
train
to
salem
ohio
but
if
he
had
they
lost
the
trail
there
and
anyhow
with
the
railroad
service
tied
up
by
the
storm
there
was
much
chance
of
his
getting
to
finleyville
in
time
luckily
stitt
was
in
bed
with
a
mustard
leaf
over
his
stomach
and
ice
on
his
head
and
did
know
whether
it
was
night
or
morning
but
thoburn
was
going
around
with
a
watch
in
his
hand
and
sam
was
for
killing
him
and
burying
the
body
in
the
snow
at
half
past
five
i
just
about
gave
up
i
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
wondering
why
i
taken
influenza
the
spring
before
from
getting
my
feet
wet
in
a
shower
when
i
had
been
standing
in
a
mineral
spring
for
so
many
years
that
it
a
wonder
i
not
it
was
when
i
had
influenza
that
the
old
doctor
made
the
will
you
remember
maybe
i
was
crying
i
do
recall
it
was
dark
outside
and
nothing
inside
but
firelight
suddenly
i
seemed
to
feel
somebody
looking
at
the
back
of
my
neck
and
i
turned
around
there
was
a
man
standing
outside
one
of
the
windows
staring
in
my
first
thought
of
course
was
that
it
was
dick
but
just
as
the
face
vanished
i
saw
that
it
was
it
was
older
by
three
or
four
years
than
dick
and
a
bit
fuller
i
not
nervous
i
had
to
hold
my
own
against
chronic
grouches
too
long
to
have
nerves
so
i
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
the
man
came
around
the
corner
just
then
and
i
could
see
him
plainly
in
the
firelight
he
was
covered
with
snow
and
he
wore
a
sweater
and
no
overcoat
but
he
looked
like
a
gentleman
i
beg
your
pardon
for
spying
he
said
but
the
fire
looked
so
snug
i
been
trying
to
get
to
the
hotel
over
there
but
in
the
dark
lost
the
path
that
not
a
hotel
i
snapped
for
that
touched
me
on
the
raw
hope
springs
sanatorium
and
this
is
one
of
the
springs
oh
hope
springs
internal
instead
of
eternal
he
said
awfully
bad
is
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
i
better
come
in
and
get
some
i
short
on
hope
just
now
i
thought
that
was
likely
enough
for
although
his
voice
was
cheerful
and
his
eyes
smiled
there
was
a
drawn
look
around
his
mouth
and
he
had
shaved
that
day
i
wish
i
had
had
as
much
experience
in
learning
what
right
with
folks
as
i
have
had
in
learning
what
wrong
with
them
you
better
come
in
and
get
warm
anyhow
i
told
him
only
spring
any
more
gags
i
been
for
fourteen
years
and
served
all
the
fancy
drinks
you
can
name
over
the
brass
railing
of
that
spring
nowadays
when
a
fellow
gets
smart
and
asks
for
a
mamie
taylor
i
charge
him
a
mamie
taylor
price
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
came
over
to
the
fire
i
pretty
well
frozen
he
said
do
be
astonished
if
i
melt
before
your
eyes
i
been
walking
for
hours
now
that
i
had
a
better
chance
to
see
him
i
sized
up
that
drawn
look
around
his
mouth
missed
your
luncheon
i
suppose
i
said
poking
the
fire
log
he
grinned
rather
sheepishly
well
i
have
had
any
and
i
certainly
missed
it
he
said
fasting
healthy
you
know
i
thought
of
senator
biggs
who
carried
enough
fat
to
nourish
him
for
months
and
then
i
looked
at
my
visitor
who
had
an
ounce
of
extra
flesh
on
him
nothing
healthy
that
is
natural
i
declared
if
you
care
for
a
dish
of
buttered
and
salted
there
some
on
the
mantel
pretty
salty
the
idea
is
to
make
folks
thirsty
so
they
enjoy
the
mineral
water
think
of
raising
a
real
thirst
only
to
drown
it
with
spring
water
he
said
but
he
got
the
pop
corn
and
he
ate
it
all
if
he
had
had
any
luncheon
he
had
had
much
breakfast
the
queer
part
was
he
was
a
gentleman
his
clothes
were
the
right
sort
but
he
had
on
patent
leather
shoes
in
all
that
snow
and
an
automobile
cap
i
put
away
the
glasses
while
he
ate
pretty
soon
he
looked
up
and
the
drawn
lines
were
gone
he
was
like
dick
but
he
was
the
same
type
only
taller
and
heavier
built
and
so
it
is
a
hotel
he
remarked
well
i
sorry
the
caravansary
in
the
village
is
not
to
my
liking
and
i
had
thought
of
engaging
a
suite
up
here
my
secretary
usually
attends
to
these
things
but
do
take
away
all
the
glasses
heb
i
beg
your
pardon
but
the
thirst
is
coming
he
filled
the
glass
himself
and
then
he
came
up
and
stood
in
front
of
me
with
the
glass
held
up
in
the
air
to
the
best
woman
i
have
met
in
many
days
he
said
not
mocking
but
serious
i
was
about
to
lie
down
and
let
the
little
birds
cover
me
with
leaves
then
he
glanced
at
the
empty
dish
and
smiled
to
buttered
long
may
it
wave
he
said
and
emptied
the
glass
well
i
found
a
couple
of
apples
in
my
pantry
and
brought
them
out
and
after
he
ate
them
he
told
me
what
had
happened
to
him
he
had
been
a
little
of
everything
since
he
left
college
he
was
about
had
crossed
the
atlantic
in
a
catboat
and
gone
with
somebody
or
other
into
some
part
of
africa
they
got
lost
and
had
to
eat
each
other
or
lizards
or
something
like
that
and
then
he
went
to
the
philippines
and
got
stuck
there
and
had
to
sell
books
to
get
home
he
had
a
little
money
enough
for
a
he
said
and
all
his
folks
were
dead
then
a
college
friend
of
his
wrote
a
rural
play
called
sweet
peas
great
title
do
you
think
he
asked
and
he
put
up
all
the
money
it
would
have
been
a
hit
he
said
but
the
kid
in
the
play
the
one
that
unites
its
parents
in
the
last
act
just
before
he
dies
of
tuberculosis
the
kid
took
the
mumps
and
looked
as
if
instead
of
fading
away
he
was
going
to
blow
up
everybody
was
so
afraid
of
him
that
they
let
him
die
alone
for
three
nights
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
then
the
leading
woman
took
the
mumps
and
the
sheriff
took
everything
else
you
city
folks
seem
to
know
so
much
i
said
and
yet
you
bring
a
country
play
to
the
country
why
do
you
bring
out
a
play
with
women
in
gowns
and
champagne
suppers
and
a
scandal
or
two
they
packed
pike
three
years
ago
with
a
play
called
why
women
sin
well
of
course
the
thing
failed
and
he
lost
every
dollar
he
put
into
it
which
was
all
he
had
including
what
he
had
in
his
pockets
they
seized
my
trunks
he
explained
and
i
sold
my
overcoat
for
eight
dollars
which
took
one
of
the
girls
back
home
it
hard
for
the
women
a
fellow
can
always
get
some
sort
of
a
job
i
was
coming
up
here
to
see
if
they
needed
an
extra
clerk
or
a
waiter
or
chauffeur
or
anything
that
meant
a
roof
and
something
to
eat
but
i
suppose
they
do
need
a
no
i
answered
but
i
tell
you
what
i
think
they
going
to
need
and
that
an
owner
chapter
vi
the
conspiracy
i
not
making
any
excuses
i
did
it
for
the
best
in
any
sort
of
crisis
there
are
always
folks
who
stand
around
and
wring
their
hands
and
say
what
shall
we
do
and
then
if
it
a
fire
and
somebody
has
had
enough
sense
to
send
for
the
engines
they
say
just
look
at
what
the
water
did
although
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
the
only
one
that
suffered
any
damage
if
thoburn
had
not
been
there
sitting
by
to
see
the
old
sanatorium
die
so
it
could
sprout
wings
and
fly
as
a
summer
hotel
i
never
have
thought
of
it
but
i
was
in
despair
i
got
up
and
opened
the
door
but
the
snow
came
in
in
a
cloud
and
the
path
was
half
a
foot
deep
again
it
shows
on
what
little
threads
big
things
hang
for
when
i
saw
the
storm
i
gave
up
the
idea
of
bringing
sam
down
to
see
the
young
man
and
the
breath
of
fresh
air
in
my
face
brought
me
to
my
senses
but
the
angel
of
providence
appeared
in
the
shape
of
mike
the
bath
man
coming
down
through
the
snow
in
a
tearing
rage
the
instant
i
saw
mike
i
knew
it
was
settled
am
i
or
am
i
not
to
give
moody
a
needle
shower
he
shouted
almost
beside
himself
and
i
saw
he
had
his
overcoat
over
his
bath
costume
which
is
a
turkish
towel
a
needle
shower
followed
by
a
salt
rub
said
i
he
been
having
them
for
eleven
years
what
the
matter
that
fool
of
a
young
doctor
shouted
mike
he
told
him
before
he
left
that
if
he
been
taking
them
for
eleven
years
and
was
any
better
it
was
time
to
stop
ai
business
bad
enough
only
four
people
in
the
house
takin
baths
regular
without
his
buttin
in
where
mr
moody
in
the
bath
i
locked
up
his
clothes
you
give
him
a
needle
shower
and
a
salt
rub
i
ordered
and
if
he
makes
a
fuss
just
send
for
me
and
mike
i
said
as
he
started
out
ask
van
alstyne
to
come
out
here
immediately
that
the
way
it
was
all
the
time
everybody
brought
their
troubles
to
me
and
i
guess
i
thought
i
was
a
little
tin
god
on
wheels
and
the
place
could
get
along
without
me
but
it
did
it
does
we
all
think
leave
a
big
hole
behind
us
when
we
go
but
it
just
like
taking
your
thumb
out
of
a
bowl
of
soup
there
is
even
a
dent
van
alstyne
came
out
on
the
run
and
when
he
saw
pierce
by
the
fire
that
was
his
name
alan
pierce
he
stopped
and
stared
then
he
said
you
infernal
young
scamp
and
with
that
pierce
jumped
up
surprised
and
pretty
mad
and
van
alstyne
saw
his
mistake
i
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
the
fact
is
i
was
expecting
somebody
else
and
in
the
firelight
you
surprised
me
that
all
said
pierce
under
the
circumstances
i
glad
i
not
the
other
chap
you
may
be
assured
sam
grimly
you
not
unlike
him
by
the
way
a
little
taller
and
heavier
but
now
it
all
very
well
for
sam
to
say
i
originated
the
idea
and
all
that
but
as
truly
as
i
am
writing
this
as
i
watched
his
face
i
saw
the
same
thought
come
into
it
he
looked
pierce
up
and
down
and
then
he
stared
into
the
fire
and
puckered
his
mouth
to
whistle
but
he
did
and
finally
he
glanced
at
me
but
i
was
looking
into
the
fire
too
just
come
have
you
he
asked
how
did
you
get
up
the
hill
walked
said
pierce
smiling
it
took
some
digging
too
but
i
did
come
for
my
health
unless
you
think
three
meals
a
day
are
necessary
for
health
sam
turned
and
stared
at
him
by
jove
you
do
mean
it
i
wish
i
did
pierce
replied
one
of
the
hardest
things
i
had
to
remember
for
the
last
ten
hours
was
that
for
two
years
i
voluntarily
ate
only
two
meals
a
day
a
man
a
fool
to
do
a
thing
like
that
it
reckless
sam
got
up
and
began
to
walk
the
floor
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
tried
to
get
my
eye
but
still
i
looked
in
the
fire
all
traffic
held
up
minnie
he
said
the
eight
train
is
stalled
beyond
the
junction
in
a
drift
i
wired
the
conductor
and
carter
is
on
it
well
said
i
if
we
could
only
get
past
sam
went
on
if
thoburn
would
only
choke
to
death
or
if
there
was
somebody
around
who
looked
like
dick
i
dare
say
by
he
looked
at
pierce
who
smiled
and
looked
at
him
and
i
resemble
dick
said
pierce
well
if
he
a
moral
and
upright
young
man
he
is
sam
broke
in
savagely
and
then
and
there
he
sat
down
and
told
pierce
the
trouble
we
were
in
and
what
sort
of
cheerful
idiot
dicky
carter
was
and
how
everybody
liked
him
but
wished
he
would
grow
up
before
the
family
good
name
was
gone
and
that
now
he
had
a
chance
to
make
good
and
be
and
he
was
around
and
if
sam
ever
got
his
hands
on
him
he
choke
a
little
sense
down
his
throat
and
then
pierce
told
about
the
play
and
the
mumps
and
how
he
was
stranded
when
sam
asked
him
outright
if
he
take
dick
place
overnight
he
agreed
at
once
i
have
anything
to
lose
he
said
and
anyhow
i
been
on
a
diet
of
sweet
peas
so
long
that
a
sanatorium
is
about
what
i
need
it
like
this
explained
sam
old
stitt
is
pretty
thoroughly
jingled
excuse
me
minnie
but
it
the
fact
i
take
you
to
his
room
with
the
lights
low
and
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
shake
hands
with
him
he
going
on
the
early
train
then
you
need
mix
around
much
with
the
guests
until
and
by
that
time
i
hope
to
have
dick
within
thrashing
distance
just
as
they
got
it
arranged
that
pierce
was
to
put
on
overcoat
and
walk
down
to
the
village
so
that
he
could
come
up
in
a
sleigh
as
if
he
had
driven
over
from
yorkton
he
was
only
to
walk
across
the
hall
in
front
of
the
office
with
his
collar
up
just
enough
to
show
himself
and
then
go
to
his
room
with
a
chill
just
as
it
was
all
arranged
sam
thought
of
something
the
house
people
are
waiting
for
dick
he
said
to
me
and
about
forty
women
are
crocheting
in
the
lobby
so
they
be
sure
to
see
him
some
of
them
know
it
is
dick
i
thought
pretty
fast
he
has
been
around
much
lately
i
said
nobody
would
know
except
wiggins
she
never
forget
him
the
last
time
he
was
here
he
put
on
her
false
front
like
a
beard
and
wore
it
down
to
dinner
then
it
all
off
he
groaned
she
got
as
many
eyes
as
a
potato
and
about
as
much
sense
said
i
fiddlesticks
she
not
so
good
we
ca
replace
her
and
what
the
use
of
swallowing
a
camel
and
then
sticking
at
a
housekeeper
you
ca
get
her
out
of
the
house
in
an
hour
he
objected
but
in
a
weak
voice
i
can
i
said
firmly
i
did
inside
of
an
hour
she
went
to
the
clerk
slocum
and
handed
in
her
resignation
she
was
a
touchy
person
but
i
did
not
say
all
that
was
quoted
i
did
not
say
the
kitchen
was
filthy
i
only
said
it
took
away
my
appetite
to
look
in
at
the
door
but
she
left
which
is
the
point
well
i
stood
in
the
doorway
and
watched
them
disappear
in
the
darkness
and
i
felt
better
than
i
had
all
day
it
great
to
be
able
to
do
something
even
if
that
something
is
wrong
but
as
i
put
on
my
shawl
and
turned
out
the
lights
i
suddenly
remembered
miss
patty
would
be
waiting
in
the
lobby
for
dick
and
she
would
not
be
crocheting
chapter
vii
pierce
acquires
a
wife
whoever
has
charge
of
the
at
hope
springs
takes
the
news
stand
in
the
evening
that
an
old
rule
the
news
stand
includes
tobacco
and
a
circulating
library
and
is
close
to
the
office
and
if
i
missed
any
human
nature
at
the
spring
i
got
it
there
if
you
ca
tell
all
about
a
man
by
the
way
he
asks
for
mineral
water
and
drinks
it
by
the
time
you
supplied
his
literature
and
his
tobacco
and
heard
him
grumbling
over
his
bill
at
the
office
you
got
a
line
on
him
and
a
hook
in
it
after
i
ate
my
supper
i
relieved
amanda
king
who
runs
the
news
stand
in
the
daytime
when
she
is
laid
off
with
the
toothache
sam
was
right
all
the
women
had
on
their
puffs
and
they
were
sitting
in
a
on
each
side
of
the
door
sam
was
there
looking
frightened
and
anxious
and
standing
near
the
door
was
miss
patty
she
was
all
in
white
with
two
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
and
i
thought
if
her
prince
could
have
seen
her
then
he
would
pretty
nearly
have
eaten
her
up
thoburn
was
there
of
course
pretending
to
read
the
paper
but
every
now
and
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
once
he
got
up
and
paced
off
the
lobby
putting
down
the
length
in
his
i
did
need
a
to
tell
me
he
was
figuring
the
cost
of
a
new
hardwood
floor
and
four
new
rugs
sam
came
to
the
news
stand
and
he
was
so
nervous
he
could
hardly
light
a
cigarette
i
had
a
message
from
one
of
the
detectives
he
said
traced
him
to
salem
ohio
but
they
lost
him
there
if
we
can
only
hold
on
this
evening
look
at
that
audience
pierce
is
due
in
three
minutes
i
told
him
i
hope
you
told
him
to
kiss
his
sister
nothing
of
the
sort
he
objected
why
should
he
kiss
her
van
alstyne
is
afraid
of
the
whole
thing
she
wo
stand
for
that
i
guess
she
could
endure
it
i
remarked
dryly
it
astonishing
how
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
a
woman
can
bear
he
looked
at
me
and
grinned
by
gad
he
said
i
would
be
as
sophisticated
as
you
are
for
a
good
deal
is
that
the
sleigh
everybody
had
heard
it
the
women
sat
up
and
craned
forward
to
look
at
the
door
sam
was
sitting
forward
clutching
the
arms
of
her
chair
she
was
in
white
having
laid
off
her
black
for
that
evening
with
a
red
rose
pinned
on
her
so
pierce
would
know
her
miss
patty
heard
the
also
and
she
turned
and
came
toward
the
door
her
mouth
was
set
hard
and
she
was
twisting
the
ruby
ring
as
she
always
did
when
she
was
nervous
and
at
the
same
moment
sam
and
i
both
saw
it
she
was
in
white
too
and
she
had
a
red
rose
tucked
in
her
belt
sam
muttered
something
and
rushed
at
her
but
he
was
too
late
just
as
he
got
to
her
the
door
opened
and
in
came
pierce
with
fur
coat
turned
up
around
his
ears
and
sam
fur
cap
drawn
well
down
on
his
head
he
stood
for
an
instant
blinking
in
the
light
and
van
alstyne
got
up
nervously
he
never
even
saw
her
his
eyes
lighted
on
miss
patty
face
and
stayed
there
sam
was
there
but
what
could
he
do
pierce
walked
over
to
miss
patty
took
her
hand
said
hello
there
and
kissed
her
it
was
awful
most
women
will
do
anything
to
save
a
scene
and
that
helped
us
for
she
never
turned
a
hair
but
when
sam
got
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
toward
the
stairs
she
turned
so
that
the
old
cats
sitting
around
could
not
see
her
and
her
face
was
scarlet
she
went
over
to
the
wood
fire
our
lobby
is
a
sort
of
big
room
with
chairs
and
tables
and
palms
and
an
open
fire
in
winter
and
sat
down
i
do
think
she
knew
herself
whether
she
was
most
astonished
or
angry
biggs
gave
a
nasty
little
laugh
your
brother
did
see
you
she
said
to
van
alstyne
i
dare
say
a
sister
does
count
much
when
a
future
princess
is
around
van
alstyne
was
still
staring
up
the
staircase
but
she
came
to
herself
at
that
she
had
some
grit
in
her
if
she
did
look
like
a
french
doll
my
brother
and
miss
jennings
are
very
old
friends
she
remarked
quietly
i
believe
that
was
what
she
thought
too
i
do
think
she
had
seen
the
other
red
rose
and
what
was
she
to
think
but
that
pierce
had
known
miss
jennings
somewhere
she
was
dazed
sam
was
but
she
carried
off
the
situation
anyhow
and
gave
us
time
to
breathe
we
needed
it
if
i
were
his
highness
said
miss
cobb
spreading
the
irish
lace
collar
she
was
making
over
her
knee
and
squinting
at
it
i
should
wish
my
fiancee
to
be
more
er
dignified
those
old
austrian
families
are
very
haughty
they
would
not
understand
our
american
habit
of
osculation
i
was
pretty
mad
at
that
for
anybody
could
have
seen
miss
patty
kiss
him
if
by
osculation
you
mean
kissing
miss
cobb
i
said
going
over
to
her
i
guess
you
do
remember
the
austrian
count
who
was
a
head
waiter
here
if
there
was
anything
in
the
way
of
osculation
that
that
member
of
an
old
austrian
family
did
know
i
got
to
find
it
out
he
could
kiss
all
around
any
american
i
ever
saw
i
went
back
to
my
news
stand
i
was
shaking
so
my
knees
would
hardly
hold
me
all
i
could
think
of
was
that
they
had
swallowed
pierce
bait
and
hook
and
that
for
a
time
we
were
saved
although
in
the
electric
light
pierce
was
a
good
bit
less
like
dicky
carter
than
he
had
seemed
to
be
in
the
by
the
fire
well
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
everybody
went
to
bed
early
thoburn
came
over
and
bought
a
cigar
on
his
way
and
he
was
as
gloomy
as
he
had
been
cheerful
before
well
i
said
i
guess
you
wo
put
a
dancing
floor
in
the
just
yet
mr
thoburn
i
not
in
a
hurry
he
snapped
it
only
january
and
i
do
want
the
place
until
may
i
get
it
when
i
ready
for
it
i
had
a
good
look
at
young
carter
and
he
got
too
square
a
jaw
to
run
a
successful
neurasthenics
home
i
went
to
the
pantry
myself
at
ten
and
fixed
a
tray
of
supper
for
pierce
he
would
need
all
his
strength
the
next
day
and
a
man
ca
travel
far
on
buttered
i
found
some
chicken
and
got
a
bottle
of
the
old
doctor
wine
i
had
kept
the
key
of
his
since
he
died
and
carried
the
tray
up
to
pierce
he
had
the
old
doctor
suite
the
door
was
open
an
inch
or
so
and
as
i
was
about
to
knock
i
heard
a
girl
voice
it
was
miss
patty
how
can
you
deny
it
she
was
saying
angrily
i
dare
say
you
will
even
deny
that
you
ever
saw
this
letter
before
there
was
a
minute
pause
while
i
suppose
he
looked
at
the
letter
i
never
did
he
said
solemnly
there
had
been
a
queer
sound
all
along
but
now
i
made
it
out
some
one
else
was
in
the
room
sniveling
and
crying
my
poor
lamb
it
whimpered
and
i
knew
it
was
hutchins
miss
patty
old
nurse
perhaps
said
miss
patty
you
also
deny
that
you
were
in
ohio
the
day
before
yesterday
i
was
in
ohio
but
i
positively
assert
i
send
for
the
police
that
what
i
do
hutchins
said
with
a
burst
of
rage
and
her
chair
creaked
how
can
i
ever
tell
your
father
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
miss
patty
do
you
want
the
whole
story
in
the
papers
is
it
awful
enough
as
it
is
carter
i
have
asked
my
question
twice
now
and
i
am
waiting
for
an
answer
but
i
do
know
the
answer
he
said
miserably
i
i
assure
you
absolutely
in
the
dark
i
do
know
what
in
the
letter
i
i
always
done
what
i
should
i
dare
say
but
my
conduct
in
the
state
of
ohio
during
the
last
few
weeks
has
been
without
stain
unless
forgotten
but
if
it
had
been
anything
very
heinous
i
remember
you
think
somebody
crossed
the
room
and
a
paper
rustled
read
that
said
miss
patty
voice
and
then
silence
for
a
minute
good
lord
exclaimed
pierce
do
you
deny
that
absolutely
he
said
firmly
i
i
have
never
even
heard
of
the
reverend
dwight
johnstone
there
was
a
scream
from
hutchins
and
a
creak
as
she
fell
into
her
chair
again
your
father
she
said
over
and
over
what
can
we
say
to
your
father
and
that
is
all
you
will
say
demanded
miss
patty
scornfully
do
know
a
mistake
never
saw
the
letter
before
oh
if
i
were
only
a
man
i
tell
you
what
we
do
pierce
said
with
something
like
hope
in
his
voice
we
send
for
van
alstyne
that
the
thing
of
course
i
send
for
er
jim
van
alstyne
name
is
sam
but
nobody
noticed
van
alstyne
repeated
miss
patty
in
a
dazed
way
i
guessed
it
was
about
time
to
make
a
diversion
so
i
knocked
and
walked
in
with
the
tray
and
they
all
glared
at
me
hutchins
was
collapsed
in
a
chair
holding
a
wet
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
one
side
of
her
cap
was
loose
and
hanging
down
miss
patty
was
standing
by
a
table
white
and
angry
and
pierce
was
about
a
yard
from
her
with
the
letter
in
his
hands
but
he
was
looking
at
her
i
brought
your
supper
carter
i
began
then
i
stopped
and
stared
at
miss
patty
and
hutchins
oh
i
said
thank
you
said
pierce
very
uncomfortable
just
put
it
down
anywhere
i
stalked
across
the
room
and
put
it
on
the
table
then
i
turned
and
looked
at
hutchins
i
sorry
i
said
but
it
one
of
the
rules
of
this
house
that
guests
do
come
to
these
rooms
they
strictly
private
it
is
my
rule
ladies
but
if
you
will
step
down
to
the
parlor
hutchins
face
turned
purple
she
got
up
in
a
hurry
i
here
with
miss
jennings
on
a
purely
personal
matter
she
said
furiously
how
dare
you
turn
us
out
nonsense
minnie
said
miss
patty
i
go
when
i
ready
rule
of
the
house
i
remarked
and
going
over
to
the
door
i
stood
holding
it
open
there
was
any
such
rule
but
i
had
to
get
them
out
they
had
pierce
driven
into
a
corner
and
yelling
for
help
there
is
no
such
rule
and
you
know
it
minnie
miss
patty
said
angrily
come
nana
we
not
learning
anything
and
there
nothing
to
be
done
until
morning
anyhow
my
head
whirling
hutchins
went
out
first
the
first
thing
i
do
if
i
owned
this
place
i
get
rid
of
that
girl
she
snapped
to
pierce
if
you
want
to
know
why
there
are
fewer
guests
here
every
year
i
tell
you
she
the
reason
then
she
flounced
out
with
her
head
up
that
was
pure
piffle
the
real
reason
as
every
thinking
person
knows
is
christian
science
it
cheaper
and
more
handy
and
now
that
it
heresy
to
say
it
the
spring
being
floored
over
i
reckon
that
most
mineral
springs
cure
by
suggestion
also
of
course
if
a
man
drinking
four
gallons
of
lithia
water
a
day
he
so
saturated
that
if
he
does
throw
in
anything
alcoholic
or
indigestible
it
too
busy
swimming
for
its
life
to
do
any
harm
pierce
took
a
quick
step
toward
miss
patty
and
looked
down
at
her
about
what
happened
he
stammered
with
the
unhappiest
face
i
ever
saw
on
a
man
i
i
been
ready
to
knock
my
fool
head
off
ever
since
it
was
a
mistake
a
my
letter
please
said
miss
patty
coolly
looking
back
at
him
without
a
blink
please
do
look
like
that
he
begged
i
came
in
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
and
you
my
letter
please
she
said
again
raising
her
eyebrows
he
gave
up
trying
then
he
held
out
the
letter
and
she
took
it
and
went
out
with
her
head
up
and
scorn
in
the
very
way
she
trailed
her
skirt
over
the
but
i
no
fool
it
did
need
the
way
he
touched
the
where
she
had
been
holding
it
when
he
closed
the
door
after
her
to
tell
me
what
ailed
him
he
was
crazy
about
her
from
the
minute
he
saw
her
and
he
had
a
change
of
linen
or
a
cent
to
his
name
and
she
as
you
might
say
on
the
ragged
edge
of
royalty
with
queens
and
princes
sending
her
stomachers
and
tiaras
until
she
hardly
need
clothes
well
a
cat
may
look
at
a
king
he
went
over
to
the
fireplace
where
i
was
putting
his
coffee
to
keep
it
hot
and
looked
down
at
me
i
a
suspicion
minnie
he
said
that
to
use
a
vulgar
expression
i
bitten
off
more
than
i
can
chew
in
this
little
undertaking
and
that
i
in
imminent
danger
of
choking
to
death
do
you
know
anybody
a
friend
of
miss
er
jennings
named
dorothy
she
got
a
younger
sister
of
that
name
i
said
with
a
sort
of
chill
going
over
me
she
in
now
oh
no
she
not
he
remarked
picking
up
the
it
seems
that
i
met
her
on
the
train
somewhere
or
other
the
day
before
yesterday
and
ran
off
with
her
and
married
her
i
sat
back
on
the
rug
speechless
you
should
have
warned
me
minnie
he
went
on
growing
more
cheerful
over
his
chicken
and
coffee
i
came
up
here
the
proud
possessor
of
a
bunch
of
keys
a
patent
folding
and
a
pocket
automobile
road
map
inside
two
hours
i
have
a
sanatorium
and
a
wife
at
this
rate
minnie
before
morning
i
may
reasonably
hope
to
have
a
family
i
sat
where
i
was
on
the
floor
and
stared
into
the
fire
do
tell
me
the
way
of
the
wicked
is
hard
the
wicked
get
all
the
fun
there
is
out
of
life
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
the
respectable
in
at
ten
and
up
at
seven
part
of
the
wicked
family
that
has
all
the
trouble
and
does
the
worrying
if
we
could
only
keep
it
hidden
for
a
few
days
i
said
but
of
course
the
papers
will
get
it
and
just
now
with
columns
every
day
about
miss
patty
clothes
her
what
and
all
the
princes
of
the
blood
sending
presents
and
the
king
not
favoring
it
very
much
what
are
you
talking
about
about
miss
jennings
wedding
do
you
read
the
newspaper
he
had
really
known
who
she
was
up
to
that
minute
he
put
down
the
tray
and
got
up
i
i
had
connected
her
with
the
the
newspaper
miss
jennings
he
said
and
lighted
a
cigarette
over
the
lamp
something
in
his
face
startled
me
i
must
say
you
not
going
to
give
up
now
i
asked
i
got
up
and
put
my
hand
on
his
arm
and
i
think
he
was
shaking
if
you
do
i
i
go
out
and
drown
myself
head
down
in
the
spring
he
had
been
going
to
run
away
i
saw
it
then
but
he
put
a
hand
over
mine
then
he
looked
at
the
door
where
miss
patty
had
gone
out
and
gave
himself
a
shake
i
stay
he
said
we
fight
it
out
on
this
line
if
it
takes
all
summer
minnie
he
stood
looking
into
the
fire
and
although
i
not
fond
of
men
knowing
as
i
have
explained
a
great
deal
about
their
stomachs
and
livers
and
very
little
about
their
hearts
there
was
something
about
pierce
that
made
me
want
to
go
up
and
pat
him
on
the
head
like
a
little
boy
after
all
he
said
what
blue
blood
to
good
red
blood
which
was
almost
what
the
bishop
had
said
chapter
viii
and
moody
indigestion
moody
took
indigestion
that
night
not
but
that
he
always
had
it
but
this
was
worse
and
moody
came
to
my
room
about
two
and
knocked
at
the
door
you
better
come
she
said
there
no
doctor
and
he
awful
bad
blames
you
too
he
says
you
made
him
take
a
salt
rub
my
land
i
snapped
trying
to
find
my
bedroom
slippers
i
did
make
him
take
clam
chowder
for
supper
and
that
what
the
matter
with
him
he
going
on
a
strained
rice
diet
that
what
he
going
to
do
got
to
have
my
sleep
she
was
waiting
in
the
hall
in
her
kimono
and
holding
a
candle
anybody
could
see
she
been
crying
as
she
often
said
to
me
of
course
she
was
grateful
that
moody
did
drink
no
one
knew
his
virtues
better
than
she
did
but
her
sister
married
a
man
who
went
on
a
terrible
bat
twice
a
year
and
all
the
rest
of
the
time
he
was
humble
and
affable
trying
to
make
up
for
it
and
sometimes
she
thought
if
moody
would
only
take
a
little
whisky
when
he
had
these
attacks
i
rather
be
the
wife
of
a
cheerful
drunkard
any
time
than
have
to
live
with
a
cantankerous
saint
miss
cobb
and
i
had
had
many
a
fight
over
it
but
at
that
time
there
was
much
likelihood
of
either
of
us
being
called
on
to
choose
well
we
went
down
to
moody
room
and
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
with
his
knees
drawn
up
to
his
chin
and
a
bottle
held
to
him
look
at
your
work
woman
he
said
to
me
when
i
opened
the
door
i
dying
you
look
sick
i
said
going
over
to
the
bed
it
never
does
to
cross
them
when
they
get
to
the
stage
the
pharmacy
clerk
gone
to
a
dance
over
at
trimble
but
i
guess
i
can
find
you
some
whisky
do
have
some
whisky
george
begged
moody
remembering
her
i
never
touch
the
stuff
and
you
both
know
it
he
snarled
he
had
a
fresh
pain
just
then
and
stopped
clutching
up
the
bottle
besides
he
finished
when
it
was
over
i
have
got
any
whisky
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
we
got
him
to
agree
to
some
whisky
from
the
pharmacy
with
a
drop
of
peppermint
in
it
if
he
could
wash
it
down
with
spring
water
so
it
would
do
him
any
harm
there
is
any
spring
water
in
the
house
i
said
losing
my
temper
a
little
and
i
not
going
out
there
in
my
bedroom
slippers
moody
i
do
see
why
your
eating
what
you
should
needs
to
give
me
pneumonia
moody
was
standing
beside
the
bed
and
i
saw
her
double
chin
begin
to
work
if
you
have
ever
seen
a
fat
woman
in
a
short
red
kimono
holding
a
candle
by
a
bed
and
crying
you
know
how
helpless
she
looks
do
go
minnie
she
sniffled
it
would
be
too
awful
if
you
are
afraid
you
could
take
the
poker
i
not
going
i
declared
firmly
it
it
dratted
idiocy
all
plain
water
would
do
well
enough
there
a
lot
of
people
think
whisky
is
poison
with
water
anyhow
where
the
pitcher
oh
yes
i
went
i
put
on
some
stockings
of
moody
and
a
petticoat
and
a
shawl
and
started
it
was
when
i
was
in
the
pharmacy
looking
for
the
peppermint
that
i
first
noticed
my
joint
again
a
joint
like
a
blessing
or
a
curse
the
way
you
look
at
it
i
found
the
peppermint
and
some
whisky
and
put
them
on
the
stairs
then
i
took
my
pitcher
and
lantern
and
started
for
the
it
was
still
snowing
and
part
of
the
time
moody
stockings
were
up
to
their
knees
the
wind
was
blowing
hard
and
when
i
rounded
the
corner
of
the
house
my
lantern
went
out
i
stood
there
in
the
storm
with
the
shawl
flapping
thanking
heaven
i
was
a
single
woman
and
about
ready
to
go
back
and
tell
moody
what
i
thought
of
him
when
i
looked
toward
the
at
first
i
thought
it
was
afire
then
i
saw
that
the
light
was
coming
from
the
windows
somebody
was
inside
with
a
big
fire
and
all
the
lights
going
i
had
tramps
sleep
all
night
in
the
before
and
once
they
left
a
card
by
the
spring
water
water
everywhere
and
not
a
drop
to
drink
so
i
started
out
through
the
snow
on
a
half
run
by
the
bridge
over
hope
springs
creek
i
slipped
and
fell
and
i
heard
the
pitcher
smash
to
bits
on
the
ice
below
but
as
soon
as
i
could
move
i
went
on
again
that
had
been
my
home
for
a
good
many
years
and
the
tramp
did
live
who
could
spend
the
night
there
if
i
knew
it
i
realized
then
that
i
should
have
taken
the
poker
i
went
over
cautiously
to
one
of
the
windows
wading
in
deep
snow
to
get
there
and
if
you
have
ever
done
that
in
a
pair
of
bedroom
slippers
you
can
realize
the
state
of
my
mind
and
looked
in
there
were
three
chairs
drawn
up
in
a
row
in
front
of
the
fire
with
my
bearskin
on
them
to
make
a
couch
and
my
shepherd
plaid
shawl
folded
at
one
end
for
a
pillow
and
stretched
on
that
with
her
long
sealskin
coat
laid
over
her
was
dorothy
jennings
miss
younger
sister
she
was
alone
as
far
as
i
could
see
and
she
was
leaning
on
her
elbow
with
her
cheek
in
her
hand
staring
at
the
fire
just
then
the
door
into
the
pantry
opened
and
out
came
dick
himself
were
you
calling
honey
he
said
coming
over
and
looking
down
at
her
you
were
such
a
long
time
says
she
glancing
up
under
her
lashes
at
him
i
i
was
lonely
bless
you
says
dick
stooping
over
her
what
did
i
ever
do
without
you
i
could
have
told
her
a
few
things
he
did
but
by
that
time
it
was
coming
over
me
pretty
strong
that
here
was
the
real
dicky
carter
and
that
i
had
an
extra
one
on
my
hands
the
minute
i
looked
at
this
one
i
knew
that
nobody
but
a
blind
man
would
mistake
one
for
the
other
and
thoburn
was
blind
i
tell
you
i
stood
out
in
that
and
perspired
when
i
looked
again
dick
was
on
his
knees
by
the
row
of
chairs
and
miss
dorothy
dicky
of
course
was
running
her
fingers
through
his
hair
minnie
used
to
keep
apples
and
things
in
the
pantry
he
said
but
she
must
be
growing
stingy
in
her
old
age
there
not
a
bite
there
i
not
so
very
hungry
when
i
have
you
cooed
dicky
but
you
ca
eat
me
he
brought
her
hand
down
from
his
hair
i
may
be
stingy
in
my
old
age
but
i
learned
a
few
things
and
one
is
that
a
man
feels
like
a
fool
with
his
hair
rumpled
and
i
can
tell
the
degree
of
a
woman
experience
by
the
way
she
lets
his
top
hair
alone
and
pretended
to
bite
it
her
hand
of
course
although
i
could
eat
you
he
said
i
like
to
take
a
bite
out
of
your
throat
right
there
well
it
was
no
place
for
me
unless
they
knew
i
was
around
i
waded
around
to
the
door
and
walked
in
and
there
was
a
grand
upsetting
of
the
sealskin
coat
and
my
shepherd
plaid
shawl
dick
jumped
to
his
feet
and
dick
sat
bolt
upright
and
stared
at
me
over
the
backs
of
the
chairs
minnie
cried
dick
as
i
a
married
man
it
minnie
herself
minnie
the
guardian
angel
the
spirit
of
the
place
dorothy
do
you
remember
minnie
she
came
toward
me
with
her
hand
out
she
was
a
pretty
little
thing
not
so
beautiful
as
miss
patty
but
with
a
nice
way
about
her
i
awfully
glad
to
see
you
again
she
said
of
course
i
remember
why
you
are
hardly
dressed
at
all
you
must
be
frozen
i
went
over
to
the
fire
and
emptied
my
bedroom
slippers
of
snow
then
i
sat
down
and
looked
at
them
both
frozen
repeated
i
i
in
a
hot
sweat
if
you
two
children
meant
to
come
why
in
creation
did
you
come
in
time
we
did
replied
dick
promptly
we
crawled
under
the
wire
fence
into
the
deer
park
at
five
minutes
to
twelve
the
will
said
on
the
ground
and
i
was
flat
on
the
ground
we
had
the
police
i
said
drearily
enough
i
would
live
through
another
day
like
yesterday
for
a
hundred
dollars
we
were
held
up
by
the
snow
he
explained
we
got
a
sleigh
to
come
over
in
but
we
walked
up
the
hill
and
came
here
i
do
mind
saying
that
my
wife
people
do
know
about
this
yet
and
we
going
to
lay
low
until
we
cooked
up
some
sort
of
a
scheme
to
tell
them
then
he
came
over
and
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
poor
old
minnie
he
said
honest
i
sorry
i
been
a
hard
child
to
raise
have
i
but
that
all
over
minnie
i
got
an
incentive
now
and
it
old
boy
for
me
from
now
you
and
i
will
run
the
place
and
run
it
right
i
do
want
to
i
retorted
holding
my
bedroom
slippers
to
steam
before
the
fire
i
going
to
buy
out
timmon
candy
store
and
live
a
quiet
life
dick
this
place
is
making
me
old
nonsense
we
going
to
work
together
and
we
make
this
the
busiest
spot
in
seven
counties
dorothy
and
i
have
got
it
all
planned
out
and
we
got
some
corking
good
ideas
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
strutted
up
and
down
it
the
day
of
advertising
you
know
minnie
he
said
you
got
to
have
the
goods
and
then
you
got
to
let
people
know
you
got
the
goods
what
would
you
say
to
a
in
the
basement
under
the
fine
i
said
with
sarcasm
turning
my
slippers
if
things
got
too
quiet
that
would
wake
them
up
a
bit
and
we
could
have
a
balloon
ascension
on
saturdays
not
an
ascension
said
he
with
my
bitterness
going
right
over
his
head
nothing
sensational
minnie
that
the
way
with
women
always
theatrical
but
what
the
matter
with
a
captive
balloon
and
letting
cranks
sleep
in
a
big
basket
bed
say
at
five
hundred
feet
or
a
thousand
a
thousand
would
be
better
the
air
purer
with
a
net
below
says
i
in
case
they
should
turn
over
and
fall
out
of
bed
it
funny
nobody
ever
thought
of
it
before
is
it
exclaimed
dick
and
we
all
sorts
of
ideas
dick
carter
has
learned
of
a
brand
new
cocktail
for
the
men
a
lulu
he
broke
in
and
i
going
around
to
read
to
the
old
ladies
and
hold
their
hands
you
have
to
chloroform
them
first
i
put
in
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
give
the
women
the
cocktail
and
hold
the
men
hands
oh
if
you
going
to
be
funny
dick
said
savagely
we
not
tell
you
any
more
i
been
counting
on
you
minnie
you
been
here
so
long
you
know
he
said
to
his
wife
when
i
was
a
little
shaver
i
thought
minnie
had
she
was
always
on
the
bank
like
a
duck
you
are
a
duck
minnie
he
says
to
me
a
nice
duck
now
do
be
quirky
and
spoil
everything
i
could
be
to
save
my
life
your
sister
been
wild
all
day
i
told
dick
she
got
your
letter
yesterday
but
i
do
think
she
told
your
father
yet
what
she
screeched
and
caught
at
the
mantelpiece
to
hold
herself
not
pat
she
said
horrified
and
father
here
well
i
listened
while
they
told
me
they
had
had
the
faintest
idea
that
jennings
and

to
school
she
sent
a
forged
excuse
and
got
a
month
off
she
had
had
any
letters
of
course
the
plan
had
been
not
to
tell
anybody
but
her
sister
until

at
the
sanatorium
the
idea
was
this

a
chronic
indisposition
disposition

jennings
daughter
and
he
apt
to
regard
my
running
away
with
dorothy
when
i
have
a
penny
as
more
of
an
embezzlement
than
an
elopement
fiddle
exclaimed
dick
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
and
now
here
and
have
to
spoil
it
all
the
thought
of
her
father
and
his
disposition
suddenly
overpowered
her
and
she
put
her
yellow
head
on
the
back
of
a
chair
and
began
to
cry
i
i
ca
tell

sobbed
i
wrote

he
was
in
a
great
rage
but
she
got
up
and
began
trying
to
pull
on
her
fur
coat
and
her
jaw
was
set
she
looked
like
her
father
for
a
minute
where
are
you
going
he
asked
looking
scared
anywhere
i
go
down
to
the
station
and
take
the
first
train
it
does
matter
where
to
she
picked
up
her
muff
but
he
went
over
and
stood
against
the
door
not
a
step
without
me
he
declared

course

his
bread

as
soon
as
the
sanatorium
succeeds
she
put
in
bravely

muff

maybe
pat
will
think
of
some
way
to
break
it
to
him

do
a
lot
with
father
i
hope
she
can
think
of
some
way
to
break
another
richard
carter
to
the
people
in
the
house
i
said
tartly
another
richard
carter
they
said
together
and
then
i
told
them
about
how
we
had
waited
and
got
desperate
and
how
we
brought
in
pierce
at
the
last
minute
and
that
he
was
asleep
now
at
the
house
they
roared
to
save
my
life
i
could
see
that
it
was
funny
but
when
i
came
to
the
part
about
thoburn
being
there
and
his
having
had
a
good
look
at
pierce
and
that
he
was
waiting
around
with
his
jaws
open
to
snap
up
the
place
when
it
fell
under
the
hammer
dick
stopped
laughing
and
looked
serious
lord

us
from
our
friends
he
said
between
you
and
sam

things
in
a
lovely
mess

to

i

she
declared
but
i
go
away
not

in
your
way
dicky
she
took
two
steps
toward
the
door
and
waited
for
him
to
stop
her
nonsense
minnie
he
exclaimed
angrily
and
put
his
arm
around
her
i
wo
be
separated
from
my
wife
you
got
me
into
this
scrape
and
i
did
marry
you
i
retorted
and
i
not
responsible
for
your
disposition
you
have
to
help
us
out
he
finished
what
shall
i
do
murder
mr
jennings
i
asked
bitterly
if
you
expect
me
to
suggest
that
you
both
go
to
the
house
and
your
wife
can
hide
in
your
rooms
why
not
asked
dick
well
i
sat
down
again
and
explained
patiently
that
it
would
get
out
among
the
servants
and
cause
a
scandal
and
that
even
if
it
did
i
was
going
to
have
any
more
deception
i
had
enough
already
and
after
a
while
they
saw
it
as
i
did
and
agreed
to
wait
and
see
miss
patty
before
they
decided
they
wanted
to
have
her
wakened
at
once
but
i
refused
although
i
agreed
to
bring
her
out
first
thing
in
the
morning
but
you
ca
stay
here
i
said
there
be
miss
cobb
at
nine
and
the
man
comes
to
light
the
fire
at
eight
we
could
go
to
the
old
on
the
golf
links
suggested
dick
looking
me
square
in
the
eye
i
took
the
hint
and
dicky
never
knew
he
had
been
hidden
there
before
nobody
ever
goes
near
it
in
winter
so
i
put
on
my
slippers
again
and
we
started
through
the
snow
across
the
golf
links
dick
carrying
a
bundle
of
firewood
and
i
leading
the
way
with
my
lantern
twice
i
went
into
a
drift
to
my
waist
and
once
a
rabbit
bunted
into
me
head
on
and
would
have
scared
me
into
a
chill
if
i
had
been
shaking
already
the
two
behind
me
were
cheerful
enough
dick
pointed
out
the
general
direction
of
the
deer
park
which
hides
the
from
the
sanatorium
and
if
you
believe
it
with
snow
so
thick
i
had
to
scrape
it
off
the
lantern
every
minute
or
so
those
children
planned
to
give
something
called
a
midsummer
night
dream
in
the
deer
park
among
the
trees
in
the
spring
to
entertain
the
patients
i
wish
to
heaven
i
wake
up
and
find
all
this
a
dream
i
called
back
over
my
shoulder
but
they
were
busy
with
costumes
and
getting
some
folks
they
knew
from
town
to
take
the
different
parts
and
they
never
even
heard
me
the
last
few
yards
they
snowballed
each
other
and
me
i
tell
you
i
felt
a
hundred
years
old
we
got
into
the
by
my
crawling
through
a
window
and
when
we
had
lighted
the
fire
and
hung
up
the
lantern
it
did
seem
so
bad
the
place
had
been
closed
since
summer
and
it
seemed
colder
than
outside
but
those
two
did
the
barn
dance
then
and
there
there
were
two
rooms
and
dick
had
always
used
the
back
one
to
hide
in
it
a
good
thing
dick
was
not
a
suspicious
person
many
a
woman
would
have
wondered
when
she
saw
him
lift
a
board
in
the
floor
and
take
out
a
rusty
tin
basin
a
cake
of
soap
a
moldy
towel
a
can
of
sardines
a
and
a
rubber
carriage
robe
to
lay
over
the
rafters
under
the
hole
in
the
roof
but
it
been
my
experience
that
the
first
few
days
of
married
life
women
are
blind
because
they
want
to
be
and
after
that
because
they
have
to
be
it
was
about
four
when
i
left
them
sitting
on
a
soap
box
in
front
of
the
fire
toasting
sardines
on
the
end
of
dick
dick
made
me
put
on
her
sealskin
coat
and
i
took
the
lantern
leaving
them
in
the
firelight
they
gone
back
to
the
captive
balloon
idea
and
were
wondering
if
they
could
get
it
copyrighted
i
took
a
short
cut
home
crawling
through
the
fence
and
going
through
the
deer
park
i
was
too
tired
and
cold
to
think
i
stumbled
down
the
hill
to
the
house
and
just
before
i
got
to
the
corner
i
heard
voices
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
through
the
snow
the
next
instant
a
lantern
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
thoburn
was
carrying
it
and
behind
him
were
the
bishop
mike
the
bath
man
and
pierce
it
like
that
man
moody
the
bishop
was
saying
angrily
to
send
the
girl
piffle
snarled
thoburn
if
ever
a
woman
was
able
to
take
care
of
herself
and
then
they
saw
me
and
they
all
stopped
and
stared
good
gracious
girl
said
the
bishop
with
his
blowing
out
straight
behind
him
in
the
wind
we
thought
you
been
buried
in
a
drift
i
do
see
why
i
retorted
defiantly
ca
i
go
out
to
my
own
without
having
a
posse
after
me
to
bring
me
back
ordinarily
said
thoburn
with
his
snaky
eyes
on
me
i
think
i
may
say
that
you
might
go
almost
anywhere
without
my
turning
out
to
recover
you
but
moody
is
having
hysterics
moody
i
forgotten
the
moodys
she
is
convinced
that
you
have
drowned
yourself
head
down
in
the
spring
pierce
said
in
his
pleasant
way
you
been
gone
two
hours
you
know
he
took
my
arm
and
turned
me
toward
the
house
i
was
dazed
in
answer
to
your
urgent
inquiry
thoburn
called
after
me
disagreeably
moody
has
not
died
he
is
asleep
but
by
the
way
where
the
spring
water
i
did
answer
him
i
could
we
went
into
the
house
moody
and
miss
cobb
were
sitting
on
the
stairs
moody
had
been
crying
and
miss
cobb
was
feeding
her
the
whisky
i
had
left
with
a
teaspoon
she
had
had
a
half
tumblerful
already
and
was
quite
maudlin
she
ran
to
me
and
put
her
arms
around
me
i
thought
i
was
a
murderess
she
cried
oh
the
thought
blood
on
my
soul
why
minnie
waters
wherever
did
you
get
that
sealskin
coat
chapter
ix
dolly
how
could
you
i
lay
down
across
my
bed
at
six
that
morning
but
i
was
too
tired
and
worried
to
sleep
so
at
seven
i
got
up
and
dressed
i
was
frightened
when
i
saw
myself
in
the
glass
my
eyes
looked
like
burnt
holes
in
a
blanket
i
put
on
two
pairs
of
stockings
and
heavy
shoes
for
i
knew
i
was
going
to
do
the
eskimo
act
again
that
day
and
goodness
knows
how
many
days
more
and
then
i
went
down
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
miss
patty
room
she
had
been
sleeping
either
she
called
to
me
in
an
undertone
to
come
in
and
she
was
lying
propped
up
with
pillows
with
something
pink
around
her
shoulders
and
the
night
lamp
burning
beside
the
bed
she
had
a
book
in
her
hand
but
all
over
the
covers
and
on
the
table
at
her
elbow
were
letters
in
the
blue
foreign
envelopes
with
the
red
and
black
and
gold
seal
i
walked
over
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
they
here
i
said
she
sat
up
and
some
letters
slid
to
the
floor
they
here
she
repeated
do
you
mean
dorothy
she
and
her
husband
they
came
last
night
at
five
minutes
to
twelve
their
train
was
held
up
by
the
blizzard
and
they
wo
come
in
until
they
see
you
they
hiding
in
the
on
the
golf
links
i
think
she
thought
i
was
crazy
i
looked
it
she
hopped
out
of
bed
and
closed
the
door
into
her
hutchins
room
opened
off
it
and
then
she
came
over
and
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
will
you
sit
down
and
try
to
tell
me
just
what
you
mean
she
said
how
can
my
sister
and
her
her
wretch
of
a
husband
have
come
last
night
at
midnight
when
i
saw
carter
myself
not
later
than
ten
well
i
had
to
tell
her
then
about
who
pierce
was
and
why
i
had
to
get
him
and
she
understood
almost
at
once
she
was
the
most
understanding
girl
i
ever
met
she
saw
at
once
what
sam
have
known
in
a
thousand
years
that
i
wanted
to
save
the
old
place
not
to
keep
my
position
but
because
i
been
there
so
long
and
my
father
before
me
and
had
helped
to
make
it
what
it
was
and
all
that
and
she
stood
there
in
her
nightgown
she
who
was
almost
a
princess
and
listened
to
me
and
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
when
i
broke
down
telling
her
about
thoburn
and
the
summer
hotel
but
here
i
am
i
finished
telling
you
about
my
troubles
and
forgetting
what
i
came
for
you
have
to
go
out
to
the
miss
patty
and
i
guess
you
expected
to
fix
it
up
with
your
father
she
stopped
unfastening
her
long
braids
of
hair
certainly
i
go
to
the
she
said
and
i
shake
a
little
sense
into
dorothy
jennings
the
abominable
little
idiot
but
they
need
think
i
going
to
help
them
with
father
i
would
if
i
could
and
i
ca
he
wo
speak
to
me
i
in
disgrace
minnie
she
gave
her
hair
a
shake
twisted
it
into
a
rope
and
then
a
knot
and
stuck
a
pin
in
it
it
was
lovely
i
wish
miss
cobb
could
have
seen
her
you
known
father
for
years
minnie
have
you
ever
known
him
to
be
so
so
devilish
was
the
word
she
meant
but
i
finished
for
her
unreasonable
i
said
well
once
before
when
you
were
a
little
girl
he
put
his
cane
through
a
window
in
the
because
he
thought
it
needed
air
the
of
course
not
the
cane
exactly
she
said
looking
around
the
room
and
now
he
putting
a
cane
through
every
plan
i
have
made
do
you
see
my
heavy
boots
it
like
this
i
remarked
bringing
the
boots
from
outside
the
door
if
he
swallowed
the
prince
and
is
choking
on
the
settlement
question
he
might
as
well
get
over
it
all
those
foreigners
expect
pay
for
taking
a
wife
did
the
chef
here
want
to
marry
tillie
the
diet
cook
and
did
he
want
her
to
turn
over
the
three
hundred
dollars
she
had
in
the
bank
and
her
real
estate
which
was
a
sixth
interest
in
a
cemetery
lot
but
tillie
stuck
it
out
and
he
would
take
her
without
it
is
quite
the
same
minnie
she
said
sitting
down
on
the
floor
to
put
on
her
stockings
the
principle
the
same
i
retorted
and
if
you
ask
me
i
have
she
said
disagreeably
and
when
you
begin
to
argue
minnie
you
make
my
head
ache
i
have
had
a
heartache
for
a
week
i
snapped
let
alone
heartburn
and
i
be
glad
when
the
jennings
family
is
safely
married
and
i
can
sleep
at
night
i
was
hurt
i
went
out
and
shut
the
door
behind
me
but
i
stopped
in
the
hall
and
went
back
i
forgot
to
say
i
began
and
stopped
she
was
still
sitting
on
the
floor
trying
to
put
her
heavy
boots
on
and
crying
all
over
them
stop
that
instantly
i
said
and
jerked
her
shoes
from
her
get
into
a
chair
and
let
me
put
them
on
and
if
you
will
wait
a
jiffy
i
bring
you
a
cup
of
coffee
i
not
even
a
christian
in
the
morning
until
had
my
coffee
you
have
had
it
yet
have
you
she
asked
and
we
laughed
together
rather
shaky
but
as
i
buttoned
her
shoes
i
saw
her
eyes
going
toward
the
blue
letters
on
the
bed
oh
minnie
she
said
if
you
only
knew
how
peculiar
they
are
in
europe
they
never
allow
a
sanatorium
in
the
family
i
guess
a
good
many
would
be
the
better
for
having
one
close
i
said
well
i
left
her
to
get
dressed
and
went
to
the
kitchens
tillie
was
there
getting
the
beef
tea
ready
for
the
day
but
none
of
the
rest
was
around
they
knew
the
housekeeper
was
gone
but
i
guess
they
forgotten
that
i
was
still
on
hand
i
put
a
kettle
against
the
electric
bell
that
rings
in
the
chef
room
so
it
would
keep
on
ringing
and
went
on
into
the
diet
kitchen
tillie
i
said
can
you
trust
me
she
looked
up
from
her
beef
whether
i
can
or
not
i
always
have
she
answered
well
can
i
trust
you
that
more
to
the
point
she
put
down
her
knife
and
came
over
to
me
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
i
do
know
what
you
up
to
minnie
she
said
and
i
do
know
that
i
care
but
if
you
forgotten
the
time
i
went
to
the
city
and
brought
you
sulphur
and
the
lord
only
knows
what
for
your
old
spring
when
you
run
short
and
were
laid
up
with
influenza
hush
i
exclaimed
you
need
shout
it
tillie
i
do
want
you
to
ask
me
any
questions
but
i
want
four
raw
eggs
in
a
basket
a
pot
of
coffee
and
cream
some
fruit
if
you
can
get
it
when
the
chef
unlocks
the
refrigerator
room
and
bread
and
butter
they
can
make
their
own
toast
they
she
said
with
her
mouth
open
but
i
did
explain
any
more
i
had
found
tillie
about
a
year
before
frying
sausages
at
the
railroad
station
and
made
her
diet
cook
at
the
sanatorium
wiggins
had
wanted
her
but
as
i
told
the
old
doctor
at
the
time
we
needed
somebody
in
the
kitchen
to
keep
an
eye
on
things
for
us
it
was
through
tillie
that
we
discovered
that
the
help
were
having
twice
a
day
with
eggs
as
scarce
as
hens
teeth
and
the
pharmacy
clerk
putting
in
a
requisition
for
more
whisky
every
week
well
i
scribbled
a
note
to
van
alstyne
telling
what
had
happened
and
put
it
under
his
door
and
then
i
met
miss
patty
in
the
hall
by
the
billiard
room
and
i
gave
her
some
coffee
from
the
basket
in
the
sun
parlor
it
was
still
dark
although
it
was
nearly
eight
and
nobody
saw
us
go
out
together
just
as
we
left
i
heard
the
chef
in
the
kitchen
bawling
out
that
he
murder
whoever
put
the
kettle
against
the
bell
and
tillie
saying
it
must
have
dropped
off
the
hook
and
landed
there
we
went
to
the
first
to
avoid
suspicion
and
then
across
back
of
the
deer
park
to
the
it
was
still
snowing
but
not
so
much
and
the
tracks
we
had
made
early
in
the
morning
were
still
there
mine
off
to
one
side
alone
and
the
others
close
together
and
side
by
side
there
was
a
whole
history
in
those
snow
tracks
mine
alone
and
kind
of
offish
and
the
others
cuddling
together
it
made
me
lonely
to
look
at
them
i
remember
wishing
i
taught
school
as
i
was
educated
to
woman
made
to
live
alone
and
most
get
married
miss
patty
did
not
say
much
she
was
holding
her
chin
high
and
looking
rather
angry
and
determined
at
the
i
gave
her
the
basket
and
took
an
armful
of
myself
i
knew
dick
would
never
think
of
it
until
the
fire
was
out
they
were
both
asleep
in
the
he
was
propped
up
against
the
wall
on
a
box
with
the
rubber
carriage
robe
around
him
and
she
was
lying
by
the
fire
with
moody
shawl
over
her
and
her
muff
under
her
head
miss
patty
stood
in
the
doorway
for
an
instant
then
she
walked
over
and
leaning
down
shook
her
sister
by
the
arm
dorothy
she
said
wake
up
you
wretched
child
and
shook
her
again
dicky
groaned
and
yawned
and
opened
her
eyes
one
at
a
time
but
when
she
saw
it
was
miss
patty
she
sat
up
at
once
looking
dazed
and
frightened
you
need
pinch
me
pat
she
said
and
at
that
dick
wakened
and
jumped
up
with
the
carriage
robe
still
around
him
oh
dolly
dolly
said
miss
patty
suddenly
dropping
on
her
knees
beside
dicky
what
a
bad
little
girl
you
are
what
a
thing
for
you
to
do
think
of
father
and
aunt
honoria
i
sha
retorted
dicky
decidedly
i
not
going
to
spoil
my
honeymoon
like
that
for
heaven
sake
pat
do
cry
i
not
dead
dick
this
is
my
sister
patricia
miss
pat
looked
at
him
but
she
did
bow
she
gave
him
one
look
from
his
head
to
his
heels
dolly
how
could
you
she
said
and
got
up
it
was
very
comfortable
for
dick
but
he
took
it
much
better
than
i
expected
he
went
over
and
gave
his
wife
a
hand
to
help
her
up
and
still
holding
hers
he
turned
to
miss
patty
you
are
perfectly
right
he
said
i
do
see
how
she
could
myself
the
more
you
know
of
me
the
more
you
wonder
but
she
did
we
up
against
that
he
grinned
at
miss
patty
and
after
a
minute
miss
patty
smiled
back
but
it
was
much
of
a
smile
i
was
unpacking
the
breakfast
putting
the
on
the
fire
and
getting
ready
to
cook
the
eggs
and
make
toast
but
i
was
watching
too
suddenly
dick
made
a
dive
for
miss
patty
and
threw
her
arms
around
her
you
darling
she
cried
i
so
glad
to
see
you
again
pat
tell
father
wo
you
he
take
it
from
you
if
i
tell
him
he

apoplexy
or
something
but
miss
patty
set
her
pretty
mouth
both
those
girls
have
their
father
mouth
and
held
her
sister
out
at
arm
length
and
looked
at
her
listen
she
said
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
to
me
do
you
know
that
when
father
knows
this
he
going
to
annul
the
marriage
or
have
carter
arrested
for
kidnaping
or
abduction
whatever
it
is
dick
puckered
her
face
to
cry
and
dick
took
a
step
forward
but
miss
patty
waved
him
off
you
know
father
as
well
as
i
do
dolly
you
know
what
he
is
and
lately

his
liver

and
he
wo

anything
why

austrian
ambassador
came
up
here
all
this
distance
to
talk
about
the
etiquette
of
the
of
my
wedding
something
about
precedence
and
he
would
even
see
him

said
dick
angrily
i
of
age
and
i
can
support
my
wife
too
or
will
be
able
soon
dolly
not
of
age
said
miss
patty
wearily
i
sat
up
all
night
figuring
it
out
he
going
to
annul
the
marriage
or
he
make
a
scandal
anyhow
and
that
just
as
bad
dolly
she
turned
to
her
sister
imploringly
dolly
i
ca
have
a
scandal
now
you
know
how
oskar
people
have
taken
this
anyhow
they
given
in
because
he
insisted
but
they
do
want
me
and
if
there
a
lot
of
notoriety
now
the
emperor
will
send
him
to
africa
or
some
place
and
i
wish
they
would
carter

out
suddenly
i
hate
the
whole
thing
they
only
tolerate
you
us
for
our
money
you
need
look
at
me
like
that
oskar
may
be
all
right
but
his
mother
and
sisters
are
hateful
simply
hateful
i
not
be
with
them
no
but
they
be
with
you
dicky
walked
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
dabbing
her
eyes
you
been
everything
to
me
pat
and
i
so
happy
now
i
rather
be
here
on
a
soap
box
with
dick
than
on
a
throne
or
a
dais
or
whatever
you
have
to
sit
on
over
there
with
oskar
i
want
to
be
happy
and
you

at
alice
thorne
and
her
duke

miss
patty
said
going
over
to
her
you
go
back
to
school
until
the
wedding
is
over
i
wo
leave
dicky
she
swung
around
and
gave
dick
an
adoring
glance
and
miss
patty
looked
discouraged
take
him
with
you
she
said
is
there
some
place
near
where
he
could
stay
and
telephone
you
now
and
then
telephone
said
dick
scornfully
ca
leave
dick
objected
got
to
be
on
the
property
miss
patty
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
to
go
you
both
perfectly
hopeless
she
said
i
go
and
tell
father
dorothy
but
you
know
what
will
happen
you
be
back
in
school
at
greenwich
by
and
your
husband
will
probably
be
under
arrest
she
opened
the
door
but
i
dropped
the
toast
i
was
making
and
ran
after
her
if
he
is
arrested
i
said
they
have
to
keep
him
on
the
place
he
ca
leave
she
did
say
anything
she
lifted
her
hand
and
looked
at
the
ruby
ring
and
then
she
glanced
back
into
the
room
where
dick
and
his
wife
were
whispering
together
and
turned
up
her
coat
collar
i
going
she
said
and
stepped
into
the
snow
but
they
called
her
back
in
a
hurry
look
here
miss
miss
patricia
dick
said
why
ca
we
stay
here
where
we
are
it
very
comfortable
that
is
it
livable
there
plenty
of
fresh
air
anyhow
and
everybody
shouting
for
fresh
air
nowadays
they
got
somebody
to
take
my
place
in
the
house
and
father
need
know
a
thing
you
can
fix
that
broke
in
dick
and
after
your
wedding
he
will
be
in
a
better
humor
he
know
over
and
not
up
to
him
any
more
miss
patty
came
back
to
the
again
and
sat
down
on
the
soap
box
we
might
carry
it
off
she
said
if
i
could
only
go
back
to
town
but
father
is
in
one
of
his
tantrums
and
he
wo
go
or
let
me
go
the
idea
with
aunt
honoria
on
the
wire
every
day
having
hysterics
and
my
clothes
waiting
to
be
tried
on
and
everything
desperate
and
all
sorts
of
things
being
arranged
for
you
put
in
dick
enviously
and
the
family
jewels
being
reset
in
vienna
for
you
and
all
that
it
would
be
great
if
you
only
did
have
to
take
oskar
with
the
jewels
miss
patty
frowned
you
are
not
going
to
marry
him
she
said
with
a
glance
at
dick
who
with
his
coat
off
was
lying
flat
on
the
floor
one
arm
down
in
the
hole
where
the
things
had
been
hidden
trying
to
hook
up
a
can
of
baked
beans
if
it
does
turn
out
well
you
and
father
have
certainly
done
your
part
in
the
way
of
warning
it
just
as
aunt
honoria
said
the
family
will
make
a
tremendous
row
beforehand
but
afterward
when
it
all
turns
out
well
they
take
the
credit
dick
was
busy
with
the
beans
and
i
was
turning
the
eggs
dick
went
over
to
her
sister
and
put
her
arm
around
her
that
right
patty
she
said
you
more
like
mother
than
i
am
i
a
jennings
all
over
except
that
heavens
be
praised
i
got
the
sherwood
liver
i
guess
i
common
plebeian
like
dad
too
i
plebeian
enough
anyhow
to
think
there
been
a
lot
too
much
about
marriage
settlements
and
the
consent
of
the
emperor
in
all
this
and
not
enough
about
love
i
could
have
patted
dicky
on
the
back
for
that
and
i
almost
upset
the
eggs
into
the
fire
i
an
advocate
of
marrying
for
love
every
time
although
a
title
and
a
bunch
of
family
jewels
thrown
in
would
worry
me
do
you
want
me
to
protest
that
the
man
who
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
cares
about
me
miss
patty
replied
in
an
angry
undertone
he
have
married
a
thousand
other
girls
had
a
marriage
been
arranged
between
him
and
the
cousin
i
know
all
that
dicky
said
and
her
voice
sounded
older
than
miss
patty
and
motherly
but
are
you
in
love
with
him
pat
certainly
miss
patty
said
indignantly
do
be
silly
dolly
at
that
instant
dick
found
the
beans
and
got
up
shouting
that
have
a
meal
fit
for
a
prince
if
princes
ate
anything
so
every
day
as
baked
beans
i
put
the
eggs
on
a
platter
and
poured
the
coffee
and
we
all
sat
around
the
soap
box
and
ate
i
wished
that
miss
cobb
could
have
seen
me
there
how
they
insisted
on
my
having
a
second
egg
and
was
my
coffee
cold
and
was
i
too
close
to
the
fire
it
was
minnie
here
and
minnie
there
and
me
next
to
miss
patty
on
the
floor
and
she
as
you
may
say
right
next
to
royalty
i
wished
it
could
have
been
in
the
with
father
crayon
enlargement
looking
down
on
us
everybody
felt
better
for
the
meal
and
we
were
sitting
there
laughing
and
talking
and
very
cheerful
when
van
alstyne
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
his
face
was
stern
but
when
he
saw
us
with
miss
patty
on
her
knees
toasting
a
piece
of
bread
and
dicky
passing
the
tin
basin
as
a
he
stopped
scowling
and
looked
amused
they
here
sallie
he
called
to
his
wife
and
they
both
came
in
covered
with
snow
and
we
had
coffee
and
eggs
all
over
again
well
they
stayed
for
an
hour
and
sam
talked
himself
black
in
the
face
and
could
get
anywhere
for
the
dickys
refused
to
be
separated
and
dick
would
tell
her
father
and
miss
patty
would
do
it
for
her
and
the
minute
sam
made
a
suggestion
that
sounded
rational
dick
would
cry
and
say
she
did
care
to
live
anyhow
and
she
wished
she
had
died
of
ptomaine
poisoning
the
time
she
ate
the
bad
oysters
at
school
so
finally
sam
gave
up
and
said
he
washed
his
hands
of
the
whole
affair
and
that
he
was
going
to
make
another
start
on
his
wedding
journey
and
if
they
wanted
to
be
a
pair
of
fools
it
was
up
to
him
only
for
heaven
sake
not
to
cry
about
it
and
then
he
wiped
dicky
eyes
and
kissed
her
she
being
as
he
explained
his
now
and
much
too
pretty
for
him
to
scold
and
when
the
dickys
found
they
were
not
going
to
be
separated
we
had
more
coffee
all
around
and
everybody
grew
more
cheerful
oh
we
were
very
cheerful
i
look
back
now
and
think
how
cheerful
we
were
and
i
shudder
it
was
strange
that
we
had
been
warned
by
pierce
square
jaw
but
we
were
not
we
sat
around
the
fire
and
ate
and
laughed
and
dick
arranged
that
pierce
should
come
out
to
him
every
evening
for
orders
about
the
place
if
he
accepted
and
everybody
felt
he
would
and
i
was
to
come
at
the
same
time
and
bring
a
basket
of
provisions
for
the
next
day
of
course
the
instant
jennings
left
the
young
couple
could
go
into
the
sanatorium
as
guests
under
another
name
and
be
comfortable
and
as
soon
as
the
time
limit
was
up
and
the
place
was
still
running
smoothly
they
could
declare
the
truth
claim
the
sanatorium
having
fulfilled
the
conditions
of
the
will
and
confess
to
jennings
over
the
wire
well
it
promised
well
i
must
say
stitt
left
on
the
ten
train
that
morning
looking
and
mottled
he
insisted
that
he
able
to
go
but
sam
gave
him
a
headache
powder
and
put
him
on
the
train
anyhow
yes
as
i
say
it
promised
well
but
we
made
two
mistakes
we
count
on
thoburn
and
we
did
know
pierce
and
who
could
have
imagined
that
mike
the
bath
man
would
do
as
he
did
chapter
x
another
complication
after
luncheon
when
everybody
at
hope
springs
takes
a
nap
we
had
another
meeting
at
the
this
time
with
pierce
he
had
spent
the
morning
tramping
over
the
hills
with
a
gun
and
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
people
and
what
with
three
square
meals
a
good
sleep
and
the
exercise
he
was
looking
a
lot
better
seen
in
daylight
he
had
very
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
a
very
square
chin
although
it
had
a
sort
of
dimple
in
it
i
used
to
wonder
which
won
out
the
dimple
or
the
chin
but
i
was
long
in
finding
out
well
he
looked
dazed
when
i
took
him
to
the
and
he
saw
dick
and
dick
and
the
sams
and
miss
patty
they
gave
him
a
to
sit
on
and
sam
explained
the
situation
i
know
it
asking
a
good
bit
pierce
he
said
and
personally
i
can
see
only
one
way
out
of
all
this
carter
ought
to
go
in
and
take
charge
and
his
er
wife
ought
to
go
back
to
school
but
they
have
it
and
er
there
are
other
reasons
he
glanced
at
miss
patty
pierce
also
glanced
at
miss
patty
he
been
glancing
at
her
at
intervals
of
two
seconds
ever
since
she
came
in
and
being
a
woman
and
having
a
point
to
gain
miss
patty
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
night
before
and
was
very
nice
to
him
once
she
smiled
directly
at
him
and
whatever
he
was
saying
died
in
his
throat
of
the
shock
when
she
turned
her
head
away
he
stared
at
the
back
of
her
neck
and
when
she
looked
at
the
fire
he
gazed
at
her
profile
and
always
with
that
puzzled
look
as
if
he
had
yet
come
to
believe
that
she
was
the
newspaper
miss
jennings
after
everything
had
been
explained
to
him
including
liver
and
disposition
she
turned
to
him
and
said
we
are
in
your
hands
you
see
pierce
are
you
going
to
help
us
and
when
she
asked
him
that
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
was
only
sorry
he
could
die
helping
if
everybody
agrees
to
it
he
said
looking
at
her
and
you
all
think
it
feasible
and
i
can
carry
it
off
i
perfectly
willing
to
try
oh
it
feasible
dick
said
in
a
relieved
voice
getting
up
and
beginning
to
strut
up
and
down
the
room
it
is
as
though
i
beyond
call
you
can
come
out
here
and
consult
me
if
you
get
stuck
and
then
there
minnie
she
knows
a
good
bit
about
the
old
place
sam
looked
at
me
and
winked
of
course
said
dick
i
expect
to
retain
control
you
understand
that
i
suppose
pierce
you
can
come
out
every
day
for
instructions
i
dare
say
sanatoriums
are
hardly
your
line
pierce
was
looking
at
miss
patty
and
she
knew
it
when
a
woman
looks
as
unconscious
as
she
did
it
is
natural
eh
oh
well
no
hardly
he
said
coming
to
himself
i
tried
everything
else
i
believe
it
ca
be
worse
than
carrying
a
bunch
of
sweet
peas
from
garden
to
garden
dick
stopped
walking
and
turned
suddenly
to
stare
at
pierce
sweet
what
he
said
everybody
else
was
talking
and
i
was
the
only
one
who
saw
him
change
color
sweet
peas
said
pierce
and
that
reminds
me
i
like
to
make
one
condition
carter
i
feel
in
a
measure
responsible
for
the
company
most
of
them
have
gone
back
to
new
york
but
the
leading
woman
is
sick
at
the
hotel
in
finleyville
i
like
to
bring
her
here
for
two
weeks
to
recuperate
i
assure
you
i
have
no
interest
in
her
but
sorry
for
her
she
had
the
mumps
mumps
everybody
said
together
and
sam
looked
at
his
kid
in
the
play
got
and
they
spread
around
pierce
explained
nasty
disease
why
you
just
had
them
too
dicky
said
his
wife
they
all
turned
to
look
at
him
and
i
must
say
his
expression
was
curious
luckily
i
had
the
wit
to
knock
over
the
breakfast
basket
which
was
still
there
and
when
we
gathered
up
the
broken
china
dick
had
got
himself
in
hand
i
sorry
old
man
he
said
to
pierce
but
i
not
in
favor
of
bringing
miss
the
person
you
speak
of
up
to
the
sanatorium
just
now
mumps
you
know
very
contagious
and
all
that
she
over
that
part
pierce
said
she
only
needs
to
rest
certainly
let
her
come
said
dicky
if
they
as
contagious
as
all
that
you
have
been
afraid
of
my
getting
them
i
i
not
in
favor
of
it
dick
insisted
looking
obstinate
the
minute
you
bring
an
actress
here
you
got
the
whole
place
by
the
ears
fiddlesticks
said
his
sister
because
any
actress
could
set
you
by
the
ears
dick
sat
up
suddenly
certainly
if
she
is
well
bring
her
up
said
miss
patty
only
wo
she
know
your
name
is
not
carter
she
discretion
itself
pierce
said
her
salary
has
been
paid
for
a
month
and
as
i
responsible
i
be
glad
to
see
her
looked
after
i
do
want
her
here
i
i
pay
her
board
at
the
hotel
dick
began
only
for
heaven
sake
do
he
stopped
for
every
one
was
staring
why
in
the
world
would
you
do
that
miss
patty
asked
do
be
ridiculous
that
the
only
condition
pierce
has
made
dick
stalked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
could
help
being
reminded
of
the
time
he
had
run
away
from
school
when
his
grandfather
found
him
in
the
and
gave
him
his
choice
of
going
back
at
once
or
reading
medicine
with
him
oh
bring
her
up
bring
her
up
he
said
without
looking
around
if
pierce
wo
stay
unless
he
can
play
the
friend
in
need
all
right
but
do
come
after
me
if
the
whole
blamed
sanatorium
swells
up
with
mumps
and
faints
at
the
sight
of
a
pickle
that
was
wednesday
things
at
the
sanatorium
were
about
the
same
on
the
surface
the
women
crocheted
and
wondered
what
the
next
house
doctor
would
be
like
and
the
men
gambled
at
the
and
played
billiards
and
grumbled
at
the
food
and
the
management
and
when
they
were
drinking
spring
water
they
were
in
the
bar
washing
away
the
taste
of
it
they
took
twenty
minutes
on
the
verandas
every
day
for
exercise
and
kept
the
house
temperature
at
eighty
senator
biggs
was
still
fasting
and
biggs
took
to
spending
all
day
in
the
and
turning
pale
every
time
she
heard
his
voice
it
was
that
day
i
think
that
i
found
the
magazine
with
upton
sinclair
article
on
fasting
stuck
fast
in
a
as
if
it
had
been
thrown
violently
wednesday
afternoon
miss
julia
summers
came
with
three
lap
robes
a
white
lace
veil
and
a
french
poodle
in
a
sleigh
and
went
to
bed
in
one
of
the
best
rooms
and
that
night
we
started
to
move
out
furniture
to
the
by
working
almost
all
night
we
got
the
fairly
furnished
although
we
made
a
trail
through
the
snow
that
looked
like
a
fever
chart
toward
daylight
sam
dropped
a
on
my
toe
and
i
went
to
bed
with
an
arnica
compress
i
limped
out
in
time
to
be
on
hand
before
miss
cobb
got
there
but
what
with
a
chilblain
on
my
heel
and
hardly
any
sleep
for
two
nights
not
to
mention
my
toe
i
was
any
too
pleasant
it
my
opinion
you
overeating
minnie
miss
cobb
said
skin
a
sight
you
need
look
at
it
i
retorted
she
burned
the
back
of
her
neck
just
then
and
it
was
three
minutes
before
she
could
speak
when
she
could
she
was
considerably
milder
just
give
it
a
twist
or
two
minnie
wo
you
she
said
holding
out
the
curler
i
have
been
able
to
sleep
on
the
back
of
my
head
for
three
weeks
well
i
curled
her
hair
for
her
and
she
told
me
about
miss
summers
being
still
shut
in
her
room
and
how
she
offered
mike
an
extra
dollar
to
give
the
white
poodle
a
turkish
bath
it
being
under
the
weather
as
to
health
and
how
mike
had
soaked
the
little
beast
for
an
hour
in
a
tub
of
water
forgetting
the
sulphur
and
it
had
come
out
a
sort
of
mustard
color
and
how
miss
summers
had
had
hysterics
when
she
saw
it
mike
dipped
him
in
bluing
to
bleach
him
again
or
rather
name
is
arabella
miss
cobb
said
but
all
it
did
was
to
make
it
mottled
like
an
easter
egg
everybody
is
charmed
there
were
no
dogs
allowed
while
the
old
doctor
lived
things
were
different
yes
things
were
different
i
assented
limping
over
to
heat
the
curler
how
how
does
carter
get
along
miss
cobb
put
down
her
and
sniffed
well
she
said
goodness
knows
i
no
trouble
maker
but
somebody
ought
to
tell
that
young
man
a
few
things
he
forever
looking
at
the
thermometer
and
opening
windows
i
declare
if
i
had
brought
my
woolen
tights
along
i
have
frozen
to
death
at
breakfast
complaining
i
put
that
away
in
my
mind
to
speak
about
it
was
only
by
nailing
the
windows
shut
and
putting
strips
of
cotton
batting
around
the
cracks
that
we
ever
been
able
to
keep
people
there
in
the
winter
i
had
my
first
misgiving
then
heaven
knows
i
did
realize
what
it
was
going
to
be
well
by
the
evening
of
that
day
things
were
going
fairly
well
tillie
brought
out
a
basket
every
morning
to
me
at
the
fairly
bursting
with
curiosity
and
sam
got
some
canned
stuff
in
finleyville
and
took
it
after
dark
to
the
but
after
the
second
day
dicky
got
tired
holding
a
over
the
fire
and
i
had
to
carry
out
at
least
one
hot
meal
a
day
they
got
their
own
breakfast
in
a
or
rather
he
got
it
and
carried
it
to
her
and
she
sit
on
the
edge
of
her
cot
with
her
feet
on
the
soap
box
the
floor
was
drafty
wrapped
in
a
pink
satin
negligee
with
bands
of
brown
fur
on
it
looking
sweet
and
perfectly
happy
and
let
him
feed
her
boiled
egg
with
a
spoon
i
took
them
some
books
my
gray
anatomy
and
jane
eyre
and
molly
bawn
by
the
duchess
and
the
newspapers
of
course
they
were
full
of
talk
about
the
wedding
and
the
suite
the
prince
was
bringing
over
with
him
and
every
now
and
then
a
notice
would
say
that
miss
dorothy
jennings
the
bride
young
sister
who
was
still
in
school
and
was
not
coming
out
until
next
year
would
be
her
sister
maid
of
honor
and
when
they
came
to
that
they
would
hug
each
other
or
me
if
i
happened
to
be
close
and
act
like
a
pair
of
children
which
they
were
generally
it
would
end
up
by
his
asking
her
if
she
was
sorry
she
was
back
at
greenwich
studying
french
conjugations
and
having
a
dance
without
any
men
on
friday
nights
and
she
would
say
wretch
and
kiss
him
and
i
go
out
and
slam
the
door
but
there
was
something
on
dick
mind
i
had
known
him
for
fourteen
years
for
nothing
and
the
night
sam
and
i
carried
out
the
canned
salmon
and
corn
and
tomatoes
he
walked
back
with
me
to
the
edge
of
the
deer
park
sam
having
gone
ahead
now
i
said
when
we
were
out
of
spit
it
out
i
been
expecting
it
listen
minnie
he
answered
is
ju
is
miss
summers
still
confined
to
her
room
no
i
replied
coldly
ju
miss
summers
was
down
to
dinner
then
she
seen
pierce
he
said
and
he
told
her
the
whole
story
and
by
what
i
demanded
clutching
his
arm
you
wretched
boy
do
tell
me
after
all
i
done
oh
confound
it
minnie
he
exclaimed
it
as
much
your
fault
as
mine
could
you
have
found
somebody
else
instead
of
getting
of
all
things
on
earth
somebody
from
the
sweet
peas
company
i
see
i
said
slowly
then
it
was
coincidence
about
the
mumps
confounded
kid
had
them
he
said
with
bitterness
minnie
something
got
to
be
done
and
done
soon
if
you
want
the
plain
truth
miss
er
summers
and
i
used
to
be
friends
and
well
she
suing
me
for
breach
of
promise
now
for
heaven
sake
minnie
do
make
a
fuss
but
my
knees
would
hold
me
i
dropped
down
in
a
and
covered
my
face
chapter
xi
miss
patty
prince
i
dragged
myself
back
to
the
and
dropped
in
front
of
the
fire
what
with
worry
and
no
sleep
and
now
this
new
complication
i
was
dead
as
yesterday
newspaper
i
sat
there
on
the
floor
with
my
hands
around
my
knees
thinking
what
to
do
next
and
as
i
sat
there
the
crayon
enlargement
of
father
on
the
wall
began
to
shake
its
head
from
side
to
side
and
then
i
saw
it
hold
out
its
hand
and
point
a
finger
at
me
cut
and
run
minnie
it
said
get
out
from
under
go
and
buy
candy
store
before
the
smash
the
smash
when
i
opened
my
eyes
pierce
was
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
and
staring
at
the
fire
he
had
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
but
he
was
smoking
and
he
had
something
of
the
same
look
about
his
mouth
he
had
the
first
day
i
saw
him
well
he
said
when
he
saw
i
was
awake
i
guess
i
was
sleeping
i
sat
up
and
pushed
in
my
hairpins
and
yawned
i
was
tireder
than
ever
i
clean
worn
out
of
course
you
tired
he
declared
angrily
you
not
a
horse
and
you
have
been
to
bed
for
two
nights
care
killed
the
cat
i
said
i
do
mind
losing
sleep
but
it
like
walking
in
a
swamp
pierce
first
i
put
a
toe
in
that
was
when
i
asked
you
to
stay
over
night
then
i
went
a
step
farther
lured
on
as
you
may
say
by
miss
patty
waving
a
crown
or
whatever
it
is
she
wants
just
beyond
my
nose
and
i
got
a
well
i
in
to
the
neck
and
yelling
for
a
quick
death
he
leaned
over
to
where
i
sat
before
the
fire
and
twisted
my
head
toward
him
what
he
demanded
but
that
minute
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
tell
him
he
might
think
the
situation
was
too
much
for
him
and
leave
or
he
might
decide
he
ought
to
tell
miss
summers
where
dick
was
there
was
no
love
lost
between
him
and
carter
i
just
tired
and
cranky
i
said
so
is
miss
summers
settled
yet
he
nodded
as
if
he
was
thinking
of
miss
summers
what
did
you
tell
her
have
seen
her
he
said
sent
her
a
note
that
i
was
understudying
a
man
named
carter
and
to
mind
to
pick
up
her
cues
it
a
common
enough
name
i
said
but
he
had
lighted
his
pipe
again
and
had
dropped
forward
one
elbow
on
his
knee
his
hand
holding
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
and
staring
into
the
fire
he
looked
up
when
i
closed
and
locked
the
pantry
door
i
just
been
thinking
he
remarked
here
we
are
a
group
of
people
all
struggling
like
mad
for
one
thing
but
with
different
motives
mine
are
plain
enough
and
mercenary
enough
although
a
certain
girl
with
a
fine
loyalty
to
an
old
doctor
and
a
sanatorium
is
carrying
me
along
with
her
enthusiasm
and
van
alstyne
motives
are
clear
enough
and
selfish
carter
is
merely
trying
to
save
his
own
skin
but
a
girl
like
miss
pat
miss
jennings
there
nothing
uncertain
about
what
she
wants
or
wrong
either
i
retorted
she
right
enough
the
family
ca
stand
a
scandal
just
now
with
her
wedding
so
close
he
smiled
and
got
up
emptying
his
pipe
nevertheless
oh
minnie
of
the
glowing
hair
and
heart
he
said
miss
jennings
has
disappointed
me
you
see
i
believe
in
marrying
for
love
love
i
was
disgusted
do
talk
to
me
about
love
love
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
makes
two
silly
idiots
run
away
and
get
married
and
live
in
a
upsetting
everybody
plans
while
their
betters
have
to
worry
themselves
sick
and
carry
them
victuals
he
got
up
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
scowling
at
the
floor
of
course
he
agreed
he
may
be
a
decent
sort
and
she
may
really
want
him
of
course
she
does
i
said
he
stopped
short
i
been
wanting
a
set
of
red
puffs
for
three
years
and
i
can
hardly
walk
past
window
down
in
the
village
they
got
some
that
match
my
hair
and
i
fairly
yearn
for
them
but
if
i
got
i
dare
say
i
put
them
in
a
box
and
go
after
wanting
something
else
it
the
same
way
with
miss
patty
she
get
her
prince
and
because
it
is
real
love
but
only
the
same
as
me
with
the
puffs
she
go
after
wanting
something
else
only
she
ca
put
him
away
in
a
box
she
have
to
put
him
on
and
wear
him
for
better
for
worse
lord
help
her
he
said
solemnly
and
went
over
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
i
went
over
beside
him
from
the
window
we
could
see
the
three
rows
of
yellow
lights
that
marked
the
house
and
somebody
with
a
lantern
was
going
down
the
path
toward
the
stables
pierce
leaned
forward
his
hands
at
the
top
of
the
and
put
his
forehead
against
the
glass
why
is
it
that
a
lighted
window
in
a
always
makes
a
fellow
homesick
he
said
in
his
way
if
he
has
got
a
home
it
makes
him
want
one
well
why
do
you
get
one
i
asked
on
nothing
a
year
he
said
not
even
prospects
and
set
up
housekeeping
in
the
with
my
good
friend
minnie
carrying
us
food
and
wearing
herself
to
a
shadow
not
to
mention
bringing
trashy
books
to
my
bride
she
is
that
kind
i
broke
in
and
got
red
i
been
thinking
of
miss
patty
but
he
went
over
to
the
table
and
picked
up
his
glass
of
spring
water
only
to
set
it
down
untasted
no
she
not
that
kind
he
agreed
and
never
noticed
the
slip
you
know
minnie
women
are
all
alike
but
they
not
all
different
an
english
writer
has
them
classified
to
a
t
there
the
mother
woman
that
you
you
always
mothering
somebody
with
that
maternal
spirit
of
yours
it
a
pity
it
vicarious
i
did
say
anything
not
knowing
just
what
he
meant
but
i
looked
it
up
since
and
i
guess
he
was
about
right
and
there
the
mistress
woman
dicky
for
example
or
he
saw
miss
cobb
curler
on
the
mantel
and
picked
it
up
or
even
miss
cobb
he
said
coquetry
and
selfishness
without
maternal
instinct
how
much
of
miss
cobb
virtue
is
training
and
environment
minnie
not
to
mention
lack
of
temptation
and
how
much
was
born
in
her
she
a
preacher
daughter
i
remarked
i
could
understand
about
dicky
but
i
thought
he
was
wrong
about
miss
cobb
exactly
he
said
and
the
third
kind
of
woman
is
the
kind
and
they
the
salt
of
the
earth
minnie
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
by
the
spring
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
look
in
his
eyes
the
man
who
marries
that
kind
of
woman
is
headed
straight
for
paradise
that
the
way
i
snapped
you
men
have
women
divided
into
classes
and
catalogued
like
horses
on
sale
are
they
on
sale
he
demanded
stopping
is
it
money
or
liberty
or
or
a
title
usually
i
knew
he
was
thinking
of
miss
patty
again
as
for
the
men
i
continued
i
guess
you
can
class
the
married
ones
in
two
classes
providers
and
they
all
selfish
and
they
have
enough
virtue
to
make
a
fuss
about
i
be
a
shining
light
in
the
class
he
said
and
picking
up
his
old
cap
he
opened
the
door
miss
patty
herself
was
coming
up
the
path
she
was
flushed
from
the
cold
air
and
from
hurrying
and
i
do
know
that
i
ever
saw
her
look
prettier
when
she
came
into
the
light
we
could
both
see
that
she
was
dressed
for
dinner
her
fur
coat
was
open
at
the
neck
and
she
had
only
a
lace
scarf
over
her
head
she
was
a
disbeliever
in
colds
anyhow
and
all
winter
long
she
slept
with
the
windows
open
and
the
off
i
so
glad
you
still
here
minnie
she
exclaimed
breathing
fast
you
have
taken
the
dinner
out
to
the
yet
have
you
not
yet
i
replied
tillie
has
brought
the
basket
the
chef
been
fussing
about
the
stuff
we
using
in
the
diet
kitchen
the
last
few
days
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
he
shut
off
all
extras
but
i
guess
her
sister
and
dick
could
have
starved
to
death
just
then
without
her
noticing
she
was
all
excitement
for
all
she
mostly
so
cool
i
have
a
note
here
for
my
sister
she
said
getting
it
out
of
her
pocket
i
know
we
all
impose
on
you
minnie
but
will
you
take
it
for
me
i
go
but
i
in
slippers
and
anyhow
i
need
a
lantern
and
that
would
be
reckless
would
it
in
slippers
pierce
interrupted
it
only
five
degrees
above
zero
of
all
the
foolhardy
miss
patty
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
she
gave
the
letter
to
me
and
followed
me
out
on
the
step
you
a
saint
minnie
she
said
leaning
over
and
squeezing
my
arm
and
because
you
going
back
and
forth
in
the
cold
so
much
i
want
you
to
have
this
to
keep
she
stooped
and
picked
up
from
the
snow
beside
the
steps
something
soft
and
furry
and
threw
it
around
my
neck
and
the
next
instant
i
knew
she
was
giving
me
her
chinchilla
set
muff
and
all
i
was
so
pleased
i
cried
and
all
the
way
over
to
the
i
sniveled
and
danced
with
joy
at
the
same
time
there
nothing
like
chinchilla
to
tone
down
red
hair
well
i
took
the
note
out
to
the
and
rapped
dick
let
me
in
and
it
struck
me
he
was
as
cheerful
as
usual
he
reached
out
and
took
the
muff
oh
he
said
i
thought
that
was
the
supper
it
coming
i
said
looking
past
him
for
dicky
usually
when
i
went
there
she
was
drawing
dick
profile
on
a
bit
of
paper
or
teaching
him
how
to
manicure
his
nails
but
that
night
she
was
lying
on
the
cot
and
she
did
look
up
sleeping
i
asked
in
a
whisper
grumping
dick
answered
he
went
over
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hair
ruffled
as
if
he
been
running
his
fingers
through
it
she
never
moved
a
shoulder
dorothy
he
said
here
minnie
she
pretended
not
to
hear
dorothy
he
repeated
i
wish
you
would
be
such
a
g
confound
it
dolly
be
reasonable
do
you
want
to
make
me
look
like
a
fool
she
turned
her
face
enough
to
uncover
one
eye
it
would
be
difficult
she
answered
staring
at
him
with
the
one
eye
it
was
red
from
crying
now
listen
dolly
he
got
down
on
one
knee
beside
the
cot
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
but
she
jerked
it
away
i
tried
wearing
my
hair
that
way
and
it
it
is
becoming
to
say
the
least
i
do
mind
having
it
wet
and
brushed
back
in
a
pompadour
if
you
insist
but
i
certainly
do
balk
at
the
ribbon
you
only
got
to
wear
the
ribbon
an
hour
or
so
until
it
dries
she
brought
her
hand
forward
an
inch
or
so
and
he
took
it
and
kissed
it
it
should
have
been
slapped
i
tell
you
what
i
do
he
said
you
can
fix
it
any
way
you
please
when
it
too
late
for
old
sam
or
pierce
to
drop
in
and
wear
the
confounded
ribbon
all
night
wo
that
do
but
she
had
seen
the
note
and
sat
up
and
held
out
her
hand
for
it
she
was
wearing
one
of
miss
patty
dresses
and
it
hung
on
her
not
that
miss
patty
was
large
but
she
had
a
beautiful
figure
and
dicky
of
course
was
still
growing
and
not
properly
filled
out
dick
she
said
suddenly
what
do
you
think
oskar
is
here
pat
in
the
wildest
excitement
he
in
town
and
aunt
honoria
has
telephoned
to
know
what
to
do
listen
he
is
of
course
and
registered
as
oskar
von
inwald
he
did
an
awfully
clever
thing
came
in
through
canada
while
the
papers
thought
he
was
in
st
moritz
for
heaven
sake
replied
dick
tell
her
not
to
ask
him
here
i
should
know
how
to
talk
to
him
he
speaks
lovely
english
declared
dick
still
reading
i
know
all
that
he
said
walking
around
nervously
but
if
he
going
to
be
my
i
suppose
i
do
get
down
on
my
knees
and
knock
my
head
on
the
floor
what
do
i
say
to
him
your
highness
oh
i
known
a
lord
or
two
but
that
different
you
call
them
anything
you
like
and
lend
them
money
i
dare
say
you
can
with
oskar
too
dicky
put
the
note
down
and
sighed
well
he
coming
pat
says
dad
wo
go
back
to
town
until
he
had
baths
and
he
only
had
eleven
and
she
got
to
stay
with
him
and
you
need
worry
about
what
to
call
oskar
he
not
to
know
we
here
i
was
worried
on
my
way
back
to
the
not
that
the
prince
would
make
much
difference
as
far
as
i
could
see
things
being
about
as
bad
as
they
could
be
but
some
of
the
people
were
talking
of
leaving
and
since
we
had
to
have
a
prince
it
seemed
a
pity
he
was
coming
with
all
his
retinue
and
titles
it
would
have
been
a
good
ten
thousand
dollars
worth
of
advertising
for
the
place
and
goodness
knows
we
needed
it
when
i
got
back
to
the
miss
patty
and
pierce
were
still
there
he
was
in
front
of
the
fire
with
his
back
to
it
and
she
was
near
the
door
of
course
it
is
my
affair
he
was
saying
you
are
perfectly
then
i
opened
the
door
and
he
stopped
i
went
on
into
the
pantry
to
take
off
my
overshoes
and
as
i
closed
the
door
he
continued
i
did
mean
to
say
what
i
have
i
meant
to
explain
about
the
other
night
i
had
a
right
to
do
that
but
you
forced
the
issue
i
was
compelled
to
tell
you
he
was
coming
she
said
angrily
i
felt
i
should
you
have
been
good
enough
to
take
carter
place
here
and
save
me
from
an
embarrassing
situation
i
had
no
philanthropic
motives
he
insisted
stubbornly
i
did
it
as
you
must
know
for
three
meals
a
day
and
a
roof
over
my
head
if
you
wish
me
to
be
entirely
frank
i
disapprove
of
the
whole
thing
i
heard
the
swish
of
her
dress
as
she
left
the
door
and
went
toward
him
what
would
you
have
had
me
do
she
asked
take
those
two
children
to
your
father
what
if
there
was
a
row
why
should
there
be
such
a
lot
made
of
it
anyhow
they
young
but
they
get
older
it
is
a
crime
for
two
people
to
er
love
each
other
is
it
and
if
you
think
a
scandal
or
two
in
your
family
granting
your
father
would
make
a
scandal
is
going
to
put
another
patch
on
the
ragged
reputations
of
the
royal
family
of
how
dare
you
she
cried
furiously
how
dare
you
i
heard
her
cross
the
room
and
fling
the
door
open
and
a
second
later
it
slammed
when
i
came
out
of
the
pantry
pierce
was
sitting
in
his
old
position
elbow
on
knee
holding
his
pipe
and
staring
at
the
bowl
chapter
xii
we
get
a
doctor
i
had
my
hands
full
the
next
day
we
had
another
during
the
night
and
the
trains
were
blocked
again
about
ten
we
got
a
telegram
from
the
new
doctor
we
been
expecting
that
he
fallen
on
the
ice
on
his
way
to
the
train
and
broken
his
arm
and
at
eleven
a
delegation
from
the
guests
waited
on
pierce
and
told
him
they
have
to
have
a
house
physician
at
once
senator
biggs
was
the
spokesman
he
said
that
personally
he
remain
another
day
without
one
that
he
should
be
under
a
care
every
moment
of
his
fast
and
that
if
no
doctor
came
that
day
he
be
in
favor
of
all
the
guests
showing
their
displeasure
by
leaving
together
either
that
thoburn
said
from
the
edge
of
the
crowd
or
call
it
a
hotel
at
once
and
be
done
with
it
a
sanatorium
without
a
doctor
is
like
an
omelet
without
eggs
hamlet
without
ham
somebody
said
we
doing
the
best
we
can
pierce
explained
we
we
expect
a
doctor
when
from
jennings
who
had
come
on
a
cane
and
was
watching
pierce
like
a
hawk
this
afternoon
probably
as
there
is
no
one
here
very
ill
but
at
that
they
almost
fell
on
him
and
tore
him
to
pieces
i
had
to
step
in
front
of
him
myself
and
say
we
have
somebody
there
by
two
if
we
had
to
rob
a
hospital
to
get
him
and
sam
cried
three
cheers
for
minnie
the
beautiful
girl
and
led
off
there
no
doubt
about
it
a
man
ought
to
be
born
to
the
sanatorium
business
a
real
strong
and
healthy
man
has
no
business
trying
to
run
a
health
resort
and
i
saw
pierce
was
making
the
hit
that
expected
him
to
he
was
too
healthy
you
only
needed
to
look
at
him
to
know
that
he
took
a
cold
plunge
every
morning
and
liked
to
walk
ten
miles
a
day
and
could
digest
anything
and
go
to
sleep
the
minute
his
head
touched
the
pillow
and
he
had
no
tact
when
biggs
went
to
him
and
explained
that
the
vacuum
cleaner
must
not
be
used
in
her
room
that
it
exhausted
the
air
or
something
and
she
could
hardly
breathe
after
it
he
only
looked
bewildered
and
then
drew
a
diagram
to
show
her
it
was
impossible
that
it
could
exhaust
the
air
the
old
doctor
knew
how
he
have
ordered
an
oxygen
tank
opened
in
the
room
after
the
cleaner
was
used
and
she
have
gone
away
happy
of
course
pierce
was
most
polite
he
listen
to
their
complaints
and
they
were
always
complaining
that
part
of
the
regime
with
a
puzzled
face
trying
to
understand
but
he
could
he
had
a
nerve
in
his
body
once
when
one
of
the
girls
dropped
a
tray
of
dishes
and
half
the
women
went
to
bed
with
headache
from
the
nervous
shock
he
never
even
looked
up
but
went
on
with
his
dinner
and
the
only
comment
he
made
afterward
was
to
tell
the
head
waitress
to
see
that
annie
did
have
to
pay
breakage
that
the
trays
were
too
heavy
for
a
woman
anyhow
as
miss
cobb
said
he
was
impossible
well
as
if
i
did
have
my
hands
full
with
getting
meals
to
the
and
trying
to
find
a
house
doctor
and
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
julia
came
face
to
face
with
dick
carter
somewhere
or
other
and
trying
to
keep
one
eye
on
thoburn
while
i
kept
pierce
straight
with
the
other
that
day
during
luncheon
mike
the
bath
man
came
out
to
the
and
made
a
howl
about
his
wages
he
been
looking
surly
for
two
days
what
about
your
wages
i
snapped
are
you
getting
what
always
had
no
tips
he
said
sulkily
only
a
few
taking
baths
only
one
daily
and
that
that
man
jennings
there
no
use
talking
miss
minnie
got
to
have
a
double
percentage
on
that
man
or
you
have
to
muzzle
him
he
he
dangerous
if
i
give
you
the
double
percentage
will
you
stay
i
do
know
but
that
i
rather
have
the
muzzle
miss
minnie
he
answered
slowly
but
i
stay
it
wo
be
for
long
which
left
me
thinking
i
seen
thoburn
talking
to
mike
more
than
once
lately
and
he
been
going
around
with
an
air
of
assurance
that
make
me
any
too
cheerful
evenings
when
i
relieved
amanda
king
at
the
news
stand
i
seen
thoburn
examining
the
woodwork
of
the
windows
and
only
the
night
before
happening
on
the
veranda
unexpectedly
i
found
mike
and
him
measuring
it
with
a
tape
line
as
i
say
mike
visit
left
me
thinking
the
usual
crowd
came
out
that
afternoon
and
drank
water
and
sat
around
the
fire
and
complained
all
except
senator
biggs
who
happened
in
just
as
i
was
pouring
melted
butter
over
a
dish
of
hot
salted
he
stood
just
inside
the
door
sniffling
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
butter
and
then
groaned
and
went
out
he
looked
terrible
his
clothes
hung
on
him
like
bags
as
the
bishop
said
it
was
ghastly
to
see
a
convexity
change
to
such
a
concavity
in
three
days
moody
won
three
dollars
that
day
from
the
and
was
almost
civil
to
his
wife
but
old
jennings
sat
with
his
foot
on
a
stool
and
yelled
if
anybody
slammed
the
door
hutchins
brought
him
out
with
her
eyes
red
and
asked
me
if
she
could
leave
him
there
i
sorry
if
i
was
rude
to
you
the
other
night
minnie
she
said
but
i
was
upset
i
so
that
i
have
to
lie
down
for
an
hour
and
if
he
does
get
better
soon
i
i
shall
have
to
have
help
my
nerves
are
gone
at
four
sam
came
in
and
he
had
thoburn
tight
by
the
arm
my
dear
old
chap
he
was
saying
it
would
be
as
much
as
your
worth
that
ground
is
full
of
holes
and
just
now
covered
with
snow
he
caught
my
eye
and
wiped
his
forehead
heaven
help
us
he
said
coming
over
to
the
spring
i
found
him
making
for
the
armed
with
a
foot
rule
somebody
got
to
take
him
in
hand
i
tell
you
the
man
a
menace
what
about
the
doctor
i
asked
reaching
up
his
glass
be
here
he
answered
on
the
but
at
that
minute
a
boy
brought
a
telegram
down
and
handed
it
to
him
the
new
doctor
was
laid
up
with
influenza
we
sat
there
after
the
others
had
gone
and
sam
said
he
was
for
giving
up
the
fight
only
to
come
out
now
with
the
truth
would
mean
such
a
lot
of
explaining
and
a
good
many
people
would
likely
find
it
funny
pierce
came
in
later
and
we
gave
him
the
telegram
to
read
i
do
see
why
on
earth
they
need
a
doctor
anyhow
he
said
not
sick
if
they
take
a
little
exercise
and
get
some
air
in
their
lungs
my
dear
fellow
sam
cried
in
despair
some
people
are
born
in
sanatoriums
some
acquire
them
and
others
have
them
thrust
upon
them
i
had
this
place
thrust
upon
me
i
do
know
why
they
want
a
doctor
but
they
do
they
balked
at
rodgers
from
the
village
they
want
somebody
here
at
night
jennings
has
the
gout
and
there
the
deuce
to
pay
some
of
them
talk
of
leaving
let
leave
said
pierce
if
they
go
home
and
drink
three
gallons
of
any
kind
of
pure
water
a
day
sh
that
heresy
here
my
dear
fellow
we
got
to
keep
them
pierce
glanced
at
the
telegram
and
handed
it
back
lot
of
starving
would
jump
at
the
chance
he
said
but
if
it
as
urgent
as
all
this
we
ca
wait
to
hunt
i
tell
you
van
alstyne
there
a
chap
down
in
the
village
he
was
the
character
man
with
the
sweet
peas
company
and
he
stranded
there
i
saw
him
this
morning
he
washing
dishes
in
the
depot
restaurant
for
his
meals
we
used
to
call
him
doc
and
i
a
hazy
idea
that
he
a
graduate
name
barnes
great
cried
van
alstyne
let
have
barnes
you
get
him
will
you
pierce
pierce
promised
and
they
started
out
together
at
the
door
sam
turned
oh
by
the
way
minnie
he
called
better
gild
one
of
your
chairs
and
put
a
red
cushion
on
it
the
prince
has
arrived
well
i
thought
it
all
out
that
afternoon
as
i
washed
the
glasses
and
it
was
terrible
i
had
two
people
in
the
to
feed
and
look
after
like
babies
with
tillie
getting
more
curious
every
day
about
the
basket
she
brought
and
not
to
be
held
much
longer
and
i
had
a
man
running
the
sanatorium
and
running
it
to
the
devil
as
fast
as
it
could
go
not
that
he
was
a
nice
young
man
big
and
all
that
but
you
ca
make
a
diplomat
out
of
an
ordinary
man
in
three
days
and
it
takes
more
diplomacy
to
run
a
sanatorium
a
week
than
it
does
to
be
secretary
of
state
for
four
years
then
i
had
a
prince
incognito
and
thoburn
stirring
up
mischief
and
the
servants
threatening
to
strike
and
no
house
doctor
just
as
i
got
to
that
somebody
opened
the
door
behind
me
and
looked
in
i
glanced
around
and
it
was
a
man
with
the
reddest
hair
i
ever
saw
mine
was
pale
by
comparison
he
was
rather
short
and
and
he
had
a
pleasant
face
although
not
handsome
his
nose
being
slightly
bent
to
the
left
but
at
first
all
i
could
see
was
his
hair
good
evening
he
said
edging
himself
in
are
you
miss
waters
yes
i
said
rising
and
getting
a
glass
ready
although
i
not
called
that
often
except
by
people
who
want
to
pun
on
my
name
and
my
business
i
looked
at
him
sharply
but
he
had
intended
any
pun
he
took
off
his
hat
and
came
over
to
the
spring
where
i
was
filling
his
glass
if
that
for
me
you
need
bother
he
said
if
it
tastes
as
it
smells
i
not
thirsty
my
name
barnes
and
i
was
to
wait
here
for
van
alstyne
barnes
i
repeated
then
you
the
doctor
he
grinned
and
stood
turning
his
hat
around
in
his
hands
not
exactly
he
said
i
graduated
in
medicine
a
good
many
years
ago
but
after
a
year
of
it
wearing
out
more
seats
of
trousers
waiting
for
patients
than
i
earned
enough
to
pay
for
and
having
to
have
new
trousers
i
took
to
other
things
oh
yes
i
said
you
an
actor
now
he
looked
thoughtful
some
people
think
i
not
he
answered
but
i
on
the
stage
graduated
there
from
the
stage
and
then
writing
for
magazines
that
the
usual
progression
sometimes
as
a
sort
of
denouement
before
the
final
curtain
we
have
dinner
at
the
white
house
i
took
a
liking
to
the
man
at
once
it
was
a
relief
to
have
somebody
who
was
willing
to
tell
all
about
himself
and
was
incognito
or
in
hiding
or
under
somebody
else
name
i
put
a
fresh
log
on
the
fire
and
as
it
blazed
up
i
saw
him
looking
at
me
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
he
said
another
redhead
why
we
as
alike
as
two
carrots
off
the
same
bunch
in
five
minutes
i
knew
how
old
he
was
and
where
he
was
raised
and
that
what
he
wanted
more
than
anything
on
earth
was
a
little
farmhouse
with
chickens
and
a
cow
where
you
can
have
air
you
know
he
said
waving
his
hands
which
were
covered
with
reddish
hair
lord
in
the
city
i
starve
for
air
and
where
when
you
getting
soft
you
can
go
out
and
tackle
the
that
living
and
then
he
wanted
to
know
what
he
was
to
do
at
the
sanatorium
and
i
told
him
as
well
as
i
could
i
did
tell
him
everything
but
i
explained
why
pierce
was
calling
himself
carter
and
about
the
two
in
the
i
had
to
he
knew
as
well
as
i
did
that
three
days
before
pierce
had
had
nothing
to
his
name
but
a
folding
automobile
road
map
or
whatever
it
was
good
for
old
pierce
he
said
when
i
finished
he
a
prince
miss
waters
if
you
seen
him
sending
those
girls
back
to
town
well
do
all
i
can
to
help
him
but
i
not
much
of
a
doctor
it
safe
to
acknowledge
it
you
find
it
out
soon
enough
and
van
alstyne
came
in
just
then
and
sam
told
him
what
he
was
expected
to
do
it
was
much
he
was
to
tell
them
at
what
temperatures
to
take
their
baths
and
minnie
will
help
you
out
with
that
he
added
and
what
they
were
to
eat
and
were
not
to
eat
minnie
will
tell
you
that
too
he
finished
and
barnes
doctor
barnes
came
over
and
shook
my
hand
i
perfectly
willing
to
be
first
assistant
he
declared
we
put
our
heads
together
and
the
result
will
be
combustion
said
sam
and
we
all
laughed
remember
sam
instructed
him
as
doctor
barnes
started
out
when
you
do
know
what
to
prescribe
order
a
turkish
bath
the
baths
are
to
a
sanatorium
what
the
bar
is
to
a
club
they
pay
the
bills
well
we
got
it
all
fixed
and
doctor
barnes
started
out
but
at
the
door
he
stopped
i
say
he
asked
in
an
undertone
the
stork
does
light
around
here
does
he
not
if
they
see
him
first
i
replied
grimly
and
he
went
out
chapter
xiii
the
prince
principally
it
was
all
well
enough
for
me
to
say
as
i
had
to
to
tillie
many
a
time
that
it
was
ridiculous
to
make
a
fuss
over
a
person
for
what
after
all
was
an
accident
of
birth
it
was
well
enough
for
me
to
say
that
it
was
only
by
chance
that
i
was
strutting
about
with
a
crown
on
my
head
and
a
man
blowing
a
trumpet
to
let
folks
know
i
was
coming
and
by
the
same
token
and
the
same
chance
prince
oskar
might
have
been
a
girl
breaking
the
steels
in
her
figure
stooping
over
to
ladle
mineral
water
out
of
a
hole
in
the
earth
nevertheless
at
five
after
every
one
had
gone
when
i
saw
miss
patty
muffled
in
furs
tripping
out
through
the
snow
with
a
tall
thin
man
beside
her
walking
very
straight
and
taking
one
step
to
her
four
i
felt
as
though
somebody
had
hit
me
at
the
end
of
my
they
stopped
a
minute
outside
before
they
came
in
and
i
had
to
take
myself
in
hand
now
look
here
minnie
you
idiot
i
said
to
myself
this
is
america
you
as
good
as
he
is
not
a
bend
of
the
knee
or
a
stoop
of
the
neck
and
if
he
calls
you
good
girl
hit
him
they
came
in
together
laughing
and
talking
and
to
be
honest
if
i
had
caught
the
back
of
a
chair
i
have
had
one
foot
back
of
the
other
and
been
making
a
courtesy
in
spite
of
myself
we
late
minnie
miss
patty
said
oskar
this
is
one
of
my
best
friends
and
you
are
to
be
very
nice
to
her
he
had
one
of
those
single
glass
things
in
his
eye
and
he
gave
me
a
good
stare
through
it
seen
close
he
was
handsomer
than
pierce
but
he
looked
older
than
his
picture
ask
her
if
she
wo
be
nice
to
me
he
said
in
as
good
english
as
mine
and
held
out
his
hand
any
of
miss
patty
friends
i
began
with
a
lump
in
my
throat
and
gave
his
hand
a
good
squeeze
i
thought
he
looked
startled
and
suddenly
i
had
a
sort
of
chill
good
gracious
i
exclaimed
should
i
have
kissed
it
they
roared
at
that
and
miss
patty
had
to
sit
down
in
a
chair
you
see
she
knows
oskar
she
said
the
rest
are
thinking
and
perhaps
guessing
but
minnie
is
the
only
one
that
knows
and
she
never
talks
everybody
who
comes
here
tells
minnie
his
troubles
but
am
i
a
trouble
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
was
down
in
the
spring
but
i
heard
it
so
far
you
have
hardly
been
an
unalloyed
joy
she
replied
and
from
the
spring
i
echoed
amen
yes
i
so
hung
with
family
skeletons
that
i
clatter
when
i
walk
i
explained
pretending
i
had
heard
and
brought
them
both
glasses
of
water
it
got
to
be
a
habit
with
some
people
to
save
their
sciatica
and
their
husband
dispositions
and
their
torpid
livers
and
their
unpaid
bills
and
bring
here
to
me
he
sniffed
at
the
glass
and
put
it
down
herr
gott
he
said
what
a
water
it
is
the
whole
thing
is
extraordinary
i
can
understand
the
reason
for
carlsbad
or
wiesbaden
it
is
gay
one
sees
one
friends
it
is
social
but
here
he
got
up
and
lifting
a
window
curtain
peered
out
into
the
snow
here
he
repeated
shut
in
by
forests
and
hills
a
thousand
miles
from
life
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
came
back
to
the
table
it
is
well
enough
for
the
father
he
went
on
to
miss
patty
but
for
you
why
it
is
depressing
gray
the
only
bit
of
color
in
it
all
is
here
in
what
you
call
the
i
thought
he
meant
miss
cheeks
or
her
lovely
violet
eyes
but
he
was
looking
at
my
hair
i
had
caught
his
eye
on
it
before
but
this
time
he
made
no
secret
about
it
and
he
sighed
for
all
the
world
as
if
it
reminded
him
of
something
he
went
over
to
the
and
stood
in
front
of
it
humming
and
trying
the
different
combinations
i
must
say
he
had
a
nice
back
miss
patty
came
over
and
slipped
her
hand
in
mine
well
she
whispered
looking
at
me
with
her
pretty
eyebrows
raised
he
looks
all
right
i
had
to
confess
perhaps
you
can
coax
him
to
shave
she
laughed
oskar
she
called
you
have
passed
but
you
are
conditioned
minnie
objects
to
the
mustache
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
gravely
it
is
my
greatest
attraction
he
declared
but
it
is
also
a
great
care
if
miss
minnie
demands
it
i
shall
give
it
to
her
in
a
in
a
little
box
he
sauntered
over
and
looked
at
me
in
his
audacious
way
but
you
must
promise
to
care
for
it
many
women
have
loved
it
i
believe
that
i
answered
and
stared
back
at
him
without
blinking
i
guess
i
would
want
the
responsibility
but
i
had
an
idea
that
he
meant
what
he
said
about
the
many
women
and
that
miss
patty
knew
it
as
well
as
i
did
she
flushed
a
little
and
they
went
very
soon
after
that
i
stood
and
watched
them
until
they
disappeared
in
the
snow
and
i
felt
lonelier
than
ever
and
sad
although
certainly
he
was
better
than
i
had
expected
to
find
him
he
was
a
man
and
not
a
little
cub
with
a
body
hardly
big
enough
to
carry
his
forefathers
weaknesses
but
he
had
a
cold
eye
and
a
warm
mouth
and
that
sort
of
man
is
generally
a
social
success
and
a
matrimonial
failure
it
was
until
toward
night
that
i
remembered
i
been
talking
to
a
real
prince
and
i
had
once
said
your
highness
or
your
excellency
or
whatever
i
should
have
said
i
had
said
you
i
had
hardly
closed
the
door
after
them
when
it
opened
again
and
pierce
came
in
he
shut
the
door
and
going
over
to
one
of
the
tables
put
a
package
down
on
it
here
the
stuff
you
wanted
for
the
spring
minnie
he
announced
i
suppose
i
ca
do
anything
more
than
register
a
protest
against
it
you
need
bother
doing
that
i
answered
unless
it
makes
you
feel
better
your
authority
ends
at
that
door
inside
the
i
in
control
it
hard
to
believe
with
things
as
they
are
that
i
once
really
believed
that
but
i
did
it
was
three
full
days
later
that
i
learned
that
i
been
mistaken
well
he
sat
there
and
looked
at
nothing
while
i
heated
water
in
my
brass
kettle
over
the
fire
and
dissolved
the
things
against
quick
eye
the
next
day
and
he
did
say
anything
he
had
a
gift
for
keeping
quiet
pierce
had
it
got
on
my
nerves
after
a
while
things
are
doing
better
i
remarked
stirring
up
my
mixture
yes
he
said
without
moving
i
suppose
they
happier
now
they
have
a
doctor
yes
no
i
do
know
he
not
much
of
a
doctor
you
know
and
there
do
seem
to
be
any
medical
books
around
there
one
on
the
care
and
feeding
of
infants
in
the
circulating
library
i
said
and
he
can
have
my
anatomy
you
generous
he
remarked
with
one
of
his
quick
smiles
it
a
book
i
snapped
and
fell
to
stirring
again
but
he
was
moping
once
more
with
his
feet
out
and
his
hands
behind
his
head
staring
at
the
ceiling
i
say
minnie
yes
miss
miss
jennings
and
the
von
inwald
were
here
just
now
they
i
passed
them
on
the
bridge
yes
what
how
do
you
like
him
better
than
i
expected
and
not
so
well
as
i
might
i
said
if
you
are
going
to
the
house
soon
you
might
take
miss
patty
her
handkerchief
there
under
that
table
i
took
my
mixture
into
the
pantry
and
left
it
to
cool
but
as
i
started
back
i
stopped
he
had
got
the
handkerchief
and
was
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
holding
it
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
looking
at
it
and
all
in
a
minute
he
crushed
it
to
his
face
with
both
hands
and
against
the
firelight
i
could
see
him
quivering
i
stepped
back
into
the
pantry
and
came
out
again
noisily
he
was
standing
very
calm
and
quiet
where
he
had
been
before
and
no
handkerchief
in
sight
well
i
said
did
you
get
it
get
what
miss
patty
handkerchief
oh
that
yes
here
it
is
he
pulled
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
it
up
by
the
corner
ridiculous
size
is
it
and
he
held
it
up
to
his
nose
i
dare
say
one
could
almost
tell
it
was
hers
by
the
scent
it
it
like
her
humph
i
said
suddenly
suspicious
and
looked
at
it
well
i
said
it
may
remind
you
of
miss
patty
and
the
scent
may
be
like
miss
patty
but
she
does
use
perfume
on
her
handkerchief
this
has
an
on
it
which
means
eliza
cobb
he
left
soon
after
rather
crestfallen
but
to
save
my
life
i
forget
what
i
seen
him
with
that
scrap
of
linen
that
he
thought
was
hers
crushed
to
his
face
and
his
shoulders
heaving
i
had
an
idea
that
he
had
cared
much
for
women
before
and
that
this
being
a
first
attack
he
had
established
what
the
old
doctor
used
to
call
an
immunity
chapter
xiv
pierce
disapproves
hutchins
came
out
to
the
the
next
morning
she
was
dressed
in
a
black
silk
with
real
lace
collar
and
cuffs
and
she
was
so
puffed
up
with
pride
that
she
forgot
to
be
nasty
to
me
i
thought
i
better
come
to
you
minnie
she
said
there
seems
to
be
nobody
in
authority
here
any
more
carter
has
put
the
has
put
von
inwald
in
the
north
wing
i
can
not
imagine
why
he
should
have
given
him
the
coldest
and
most
disagreeable
part
of
the
house
i
said
i
speak
to
carter
and
try
to
have
him
moved
and
she
rustled
over
to
where
i
was
brushing
the
hearth
and
stooped
down
von
inwald
is
incognito
of
course
she
said
but
he
belongs
to
a
very
old
family
in
his
own
country
a
noble
family
he
ought
to
have
the
best
there
is
in
the
house
i
promised
that
too
and
she
went
away
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
talk
to
pierce
the
sanatorium
business
is
one
where
you
can
put
your
own
likes
and
dislikes
against
the
comfort
of
the
guests
miss
cobb
came
out
a
few
minutes
after
she
had
on
her
new
green
silk
with
the
white
lace
trimming
she
saw
me
staring
as
she
threw
off
her
cape
and
put
her
curler
on
the
log
it
a
little
dressy
for
so
early
of
course
minnie
she
said
but
i
wish
you
see
some
of
the
other
women
breakfast
looked
like
an
afternoon
reception
what
would
you
think
of
pinning
this
black
velvet
ribbon
around
my
head
it
might
have
done
twenty
years
ago
miss
cobb
i
answered
but
i
would
advise
it
now
i
was
working
at
the
and
i
heard
her
sniff
behind
me
as
she
hung
up
her
mirror
on
the
she
tried
the
curler
on
the
curtain
which
she
knows
i
object
to
but
she
was
too
full
of
her
subject
to
be
sulky
for
long
i
wish
you
could
see
blanche
moody
she
began
again
standing
holding
the
curler
with
a
thin
wreath
of
smoke
making
a
halo
over
her
head
drawn
in
my
dear
i
do
see
how
she
can
breathe
i
guess
there
no
doubt
about
von
inwald
i
like
to
know
who
put
this
beer
check
in
the
yesterday
i
said
as
indifferently
as
i
could
what
about
von
inwald
she
tiptoed
over
to
me
the
halo
trailing
after
her
about
his
being
a
messenger
from
the
prince
to
miss
jennings
she
answered
in
a
whisper
he
spent
last
night
closeted
with
papa
and
the
chambermaid
on
that
floor
told
lily
biggs
that
there
was
almost
a
quarrel
that
does
mean
anything
i
objected
if
the
angel
gabriel
was
shut
in
with
jennings
for
ten
minutes
he
be
blowing
his
trumpet
for
help
miss
cobb
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
took
hold
of
a
fresh
wisp
of
hair
with
the
curler
i
dare
say
she
assented
but
the
angel
gabriel
would
have
waited
to
breakfast
with
miss
jennings
and
have
kissed
her
hand
before
everybody
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
is
he
handsome
i
asked
curious
to
know
how
he
would
impress
other
women
but
miss
cobb
had
never
seen
a
man
she
would
call
ugly
handsome
she
said
my
dear
he
beautiful
he
has
a
duel
scar
on
his
left
cheek
all
the
nobility
have
them
over
there
i
a
cousin
living
in
berlin
she
the
wittiest
person
and
she
says
the
german
child
of
the
future
will
be
born
with
a
scarred
left
cheek
well
i
was
sick
enough
of
hearing
of
von
inwald
before
the
day
was
over
all
morning
in
the
they
talked
von
inwald
they
pretended
to
play
cards
but
they
were
really
playing
european
royalty
every
time
somebody
laid
down
a
queen
he
say
is
the
queen
still
living
or
did
she
die
a
few
years
ago
and
when
they
played
the
knave
they
start
off
about
the
prince
again
they
all
decided
that
von
inwald
was
noble
somebody
said
that
the
von
was
a
sort
of
title
the
women
were
planning
to
make
the
evenings
more
cheerful
too
they
could
have
a
dance
with
the
men
using
canes
or
forbidden
to
exercise
but
miss
cobb
had
a
lot
of
what
she
called
parlor
games
that
she
wanted
to
try
out
introducing
the
jones
family
was
one
of
them
in
the
afternoon
von
inwald
came
out
to
the
and
sat
around
very
affable
and
friendly
drinking
the
water
he
and
the
bishop
grew
quite
chummy
miss
patty
was
not
there
but
about
four
pierce
came
out
he
did
not
sit
down
but
wandered
around
the
room
not
talking
to
anybody
but
staring
whenever
he
could
at
the
prince
once
i
caught
von
inwald
eyes
fixed
on
him
as
if
he
might
have
seen
him
before
after
a
while
pierce
sat
down
in
a
corner
like
a
sulky
child
and
filled
his
pipe
and
as
nobody
noticed
him
except
to
complain
about
the
pipe
which
he
did
even
hear
he
sat
there
for
a
bent
forward
with
his
pipe
clenched
in
his
teeth
and
never
took
his
eyes
off
von
inwald
face
senator
biggs
was
the
one
who
really
caused
the
trouble
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
the
trying
to
fool
his
stomach
by
keeping
it
filled
up
all
the
time
with
water
he
had
got
past
the
cranky
stage
being
too
weak
for
it
his
face
was
folded
up
in
wrinkles
like
an
accordion
and
his
double
chin
was
so
flabby
you
could
have
tucked
it
away
inside
his
collar
what
do
you
think
of
american
women
von
inwald
he
asked
and
everybody
stopped
playing
cards
and
listened
for
the
answer
as
von
inwald
represented
the
prince
would
he
be
likely
to
voice
the
prince
opinion
of
american
women
it
my
belief
von
inwald
was
going
to
say
something
nice
he
smiled
as
if
he
meant
to
but
just
then
he
saw
pierce
in
his
corner
sneering
behind
his
pipe
they
looked
at
each
other
steadily
and
nobody
could
mistake
the
hate
in
pierce
face
or
his
sneer
after
a
minute
the
prince
looked
away
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
he
did
make
his
pretty
speech
american
women
he
said
turning
his
glass
of
spring
water
around
on
the
table
before
him
they
are
very
lovely
of
course
he
looked
around
and
there
were
moody
and
biggs
and
miss
cobb
and
he
even
glanced
at
me
in
the
spring
then
he
looked
again
at
pierce
and
kept
his
eyes
there
but
they
are
spoiled
fearfully
spoiled
they
rule
their
parents
and
they
expect
to
rule
their
husbands
in
europe
we
do
things
better
we
are
not
what
is
the
english
there
was
a
sort
of
murmur
among
the
men
but
the
women
all
nodded
as
if
they
thought
europe
was
entirely
right
they
have
agreed
with
him
if
he
advocated
sixteen
wives
sitting
on
a
mat
like
the
turks
pierce
was
still
staring
at
the
prince
what
i
do
quite
understand
von
inwald
the
bishop
put
in
in
his
nice
way
is
your
custom
of
expecting
a
girl
to
bring
her
husband
a
certain
definite
sum
of
money
and
to
place
it
under
the
control
our
wealthy
american
girls
control
their
own
money
he
was
thinking
of
miss
patty
and
everybody
knew
it
the
prince
turned
red
and
glared
at
the
bishop
then
i
think
he
remembered
that
they
did
know
who
he
was
and
he
smiled
and
started
to
turning
the
glass
again
pardon
he
said
is
it
not
better
what
do
women
know
of
money
they
throw
it
away
on
trifles
dress
jewels
american
women
are
extravagant
it
is
one
result
of
their
of
their
spoiling
pierce
got
up
and
emptied
his
pipe
into
the
fire
then
he
turned
i
afraid
you
have
not
known
the
best
type
of
american
women
he
said
looking
hard
at
the
prince
our
representative
women
are
our
women
they
do
not
contract
european
alliances
not
having
sufficient
money
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
nobility
or
enough
to
buy
titles
as
they
do
pearls
for
the
purpose
of
adornment
von
inwald
got
up
and
his
face
was
red
pierce
was
white
and
sneering
also
he
went
on
when
they
marry
they
wish
to
control
their
own
money
and
not
see
it
spent
in
ways
with
which
you
are
doubtless
familiar
we
were
all
paralyzed
nobody
moved
pierce
put
his
pipe
in
his
pocket
and
stalked
out
slamming
the
door
then
von
inwald
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
i
see
i
shall
have
to
talk
to
our
young
friend
he
said
and
picked
up
his
glass
i
afraid
i
given
a
wrong
impression
i
like
the
american
women
very
much
too
well
he
went
on
with
a
flash
of
his
teeth
looking
around
the
room
and
brought
the
glass
to
the
spring
for
me
to
fill
but
as
i
said
before
i
can
tell
a
good
bit
about
a
man
from
the
way
he
gives
me
his
glass
and
he
was
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
rage
when
i
reached
it
back
to
him
he
gripped
it
until
his
nails
were
white
my
joint
ached
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
about
five
thoburn
stopped
in
long
enough
to
say
what
this
i
hear
about
carter
making
an
ass
of
himself
i
have
heard
it
i
answered
what
is
it
but
he
only
laughed
and
turned
up
his
collar
to
go
jove
minnie
he
said
why
do
women
of
your
spirit
always
champion
the
losing
side
be
a
good
girl
give
me
a
hand
now
and
then
with
this
thing
and
i
see
you
do
lose
by
it
we
not
going
to
lose
i
retorted
angrily
nobody
has
left
yet
we
are
still
ahead
on
the
books
he
came
over
and
shook
a
finger
in
my
face
nobody
has
left
and
why
because
they
all
taking
a
series
of
baths
wait
until
they
had
their
fifteen
or
or
whatever
the
cure
is
and
then
see
them
run
it
was
true
enough
i
knew
it
chapter
xv
the
prince
with
apologies
tillie
brought
the
supper
basket
for
the
about
six
and
sat
down
for
a
minute
by
the
fire
she
said
pierce
carter
to
her
had
started
out
with
a
gun
about
five
it
was
foolish
but
it
made
me
uneasy
they
gone
plumb
crazy
over
that
von
inwald
she
declared
it
makes
me
tired
how
do
they
know
he
anything
but
what
he
says
he
is
he
may
be
a
messenger
from
the
emperor
of
austria
and
he
may
be
selling
flannel
chest
protectors
miss
cobb
all
set
up
she
talking
about
getting
up
an
entertainment
and
asking
that
miss
summers
to
recite
she
got
up
leaving
the
basket
on
the
hearth
and
say
she
said
you
ought
to
see
that
dog
now
it
been
in
peroxide
all
day
she
went
out
with
the
peroxide
but
a
moment
later
she
opened
the
door
and
stuck
her
head
in
nodding
toward
the
basket
say
she
said
the
chef
getting
fussy
about
the
stuff
i
using
in
the
diet
kitchen
you
got
to
cut
it
out
soon
minnie
if
i
was
you
i
let
him
starve
what
i
screeched
and
grasped
the
rail
of
the
spring
let
him
starve
she
repeated
wha
what
are
you
talking
about
i
demanded
when
i
got
my
voice
she
winked
at
me
from
the
doorway
oh
i
on
all
right
minnie
she
assured
me
although
heaven
only
knows
where
he
puts
it
all
he
sagged
in
like
a
chair
with
broken
springs
i
saw
then
that
she
thought
i
was
feeding
senator
biggs
on
the
sly
and
i
breathed
again
but
my
nerves
were
nearly
gone
and
when
just
then
i
heard
a
shot
from
the
direction
of
the
deer
park
even
tillie
noticed
how
pale
i
got
i
do
know
what
come
over
you
minnie
she
said
that
only
carter
shooting
rabbits
i
saw
him
go
out
as
i
started
down
the
path
i
was
still
nervous
when
i
put
on
my
shawl
and
picked
up
the
basket
but
there
was
a
puddle
on
the
floor
and
the
soup
had
spilled
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
back
for
more
soup
and
i
got
it
from
the
kitchen
without
the
chef
seeing
me
when
i
opened
the
door
again
pierce
was
by
the
fire
and
in
front
of
him
where
i
left
the
basket
lay
a
dead
rabbit
he
was
sitting
there
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
looking
at
the
poor
thing
and
there
was
no
basket
in
sight
well
i
asked
did
you
change
my
basket
into
a
dead
rabbit
basket
he
said
looking
up
what
basket
i
looked
everywhere
but
the
basket
was
gone
and
after
a
while
i
decided
that
dick
had
had
an
attack
of
thoughtfulness
or
hunger
and
had
carried
it
out
himself
and
all
the
time
i
looked
for
the
basket
pierce
sat
with
the
gun
across
his
knees
and
stared
at
the
rabbit
i
thank
you
to
take
that
messy
thing
out
of
here
i
told
him
poor
little
chap
he
exclaimed
he
was
playing
in
the
snow
and
i
killed
him
not
because
i
wanted
food
or
sport
minnie
but
well
because
i
had
to
kill
something
i
hope
you
do
have
those
attacks
often
i
said
he
looked
at
the
rabbit
and
sighed
never
in
my
life
he
answered
for
food
or
sport
that
different
but
he
got
up
and
put
the
gun
in
the
corner
and
i
saw
he
looked
white
and
miserable
i
do
like
myself
minnie
he
said
trying
to
smile
and
nobody
likes
me
i
going
into
the
garden
to
eat
worms
i
did
like
to
scold
him
when
he
was
feeling
bad
anyhow
but
business
is
business
so
i
asked
him
how
long
he
thought
people
would
stay
if
he
acted
as
he
had
that
day
i
said
that
a
sanatorium
was
a
place
where
the
man
who
runs
it
ca
afford
to
have
likes
and
dislikes
that
for
my
part
i
a
good
deal
rather
he
get
rid
of
his
excitement
by
shooting
off
a
gun
provided
he
pointed
it
away
from
the
house
than
to
sit
around
and
let
his
mind
explode
and
kill
all
our
prospects
i
told
him
too
to
remember
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
morals
or
actions
of
his
guests
only
for
their
health
health
he
echoed
and
kicked
a
chair
health
why
if
i
wanted
to
keep
a
good
dog
in
condition
minnie
i
would
bring
him
here
no
i
retorted
you
shut
him
in
an
old
out
oven
and
give
him
a
shoe
to
chew
and
he
come
out
in
three
days
frisking
and
happy
but
you
ca
do
that
with
people
why
not
he
asked
although
of
course
the
supply
of
out
ovens
and
old
shoes
is
limited
here
as
far
as
von
inwald
goes
i
went
on
that
not
your
affair
or
mine
if
miss
patty
own
father
ca
prevent
it
why
should
you
worry
about
it
precisely
he
agreed
why
should
i
but
i
do
minnie
that
the
devil
of
it
there
are
plenty
of
nice
girls
i
suggested
feeling
rather
sorry
for
him
are
there
oh
i
dare
say
he
stooped
and
picked
up
his
rabbit
straight
through
the
head
not
so
bad
for
twilight
poor
little
chap
he
said
good
night
and
went
out
taking
the
gun
and
the
rabbit
with
him
and
i
went
into
the
pantry
to
finish
straightening
things
for
the
night
in
a
few
minutes
i
heard
voices
in
the
other
room
one
pierce
and
one
with
a
strong
german
accent
when
was
that
von
inwald
voice
a
year
ago
in
vienna
where
at
the
bal
tabarin
you
were
in
a
loge
the
man
i
was
with
told
me
who
the
woman
was
it
was
she
i
think
who
suggested
that
you
lean
over
the
rail
ah
so
said
von
inwald
as
if
he
just
remembered
ah
yes
i
recall
i
was
with
the
lady
was
is
it
not
and
it
was
she
who
desired
me
you
leaned
over
the
rail
and
poured
a
glass
of
wine
on
my
head
it
was
very
funny
the
lady
was
charmed
i
recall
it
perfectly
i
remember
that
i
did
it
under
protest
it
was
a
very
fine
wine
and
expensive
then
you
also
recall
said
pierce
very
quietly
that
because
you
were
with
a
well
because
you
were
with
a
woman
i
could
not
return
your
compliment
but
i
demanded
the
privilege
at
some
future
date
when
you
were
alone
it
is
a
pity
replied
von
inwald
that
now
when
i
am
alone
there
is
no
wine
no
there
is
no
wine
pierce
agreed
slowly
but
there
is
i
opened
the
door
at
that
and
both
of
them
started
von
inwald
was
standing
with
his
arms
folded
and
pierce
had
one
arm
raised
holding
up
a
glass
of
spring
water
in
another
second
it
would
have
been
in
the
other
man
face
i
walked
over
to
pierce
and
took
the
glass
out
of
his
hand
and
his
expression
was
funny
to
see
i
been
looking
everywhere
for
that
glass
i
said
it
got
to
be
washed
von
inwald
laughed
and
picked
up
his
soft
hat
from
the
table
he
turned
around
at
the
door
and
looked
back
at
pierce
still
laughing
accept
my
apologies
he
said
it
was
such
a
fine
wine
and
so
expensive
then
he
went
out
chapter
xvi
stop
thief
i
was
pretty
nervous
when
i
took
charge
of
the
news
stand
that
evening
amanda
king
had
an
appointment
with
the
dentist
and
had
left
everything
topsyturvey
i
was
still
straightening
up
when
people
began
to
come
down
to
dinner
miss
cobb
walked
over
to
the
news
stand
and
she
cut
the
white
yoke
out
of
her
purple
silk
she
looked
very
dressy
although
somewhat
thin
everybody
has
dressed
for
dinner
minnie
she
informed
me
we
did
want
von
inwald
to
have
a
wrong
idea
of
american
society
especially
after
carter
ridiculous
conduct
this
afternoon
and
i
wonder
if
you
be
sweet
enough
to
start
the
phonograph
in
the
orchestra
gallery
as
we
go
in
something
with
dignity
you
know
the
wedding
march
or
the
overture
from
aida
aida
cracked
i
said
shortly
and
as
far
as
i
concerned
von
inwald
can
walk
in
to
his
meals
without
music
or
starve
to
death
waiting
for
the
band
but
she
got
the
phonograph
anyhow
and
put
the
elevator
boy
in
the
gallery
with
it
she
picked
out
some
things
by
caruso
and
tetrazzini
and
piled
them
on
a
chair
but
james
had
things
to
himself
up
there
and
played
the
spring
chicken
through
three
times
during
dinner
with
miss
cobb
glaring
at
the
gallery
until
the
back
of
her
neck
ached
and
the
girls
waltzing
in
with
the
dishes
and
out
moody
came
out
when
dinner
was
over
in
a
fearful
rage
and
made
for
the
news
stand
one
of
your
ideas
i
suppose
he
asserted
what
sort
of
a
night
am
i
going
to
have
after
chewing
my
food
to
with
my
jaws
doing
a
why
in
heaven
name
could
you
have
had
something
slow
like
handel
largo
if
you
got
to
have
music
but
dinner
was
over
fifteen
minutes
sooner
than
usual
james
everybody
out
to
my
ann
elizer
and
miss
cobb
was
mortified
to
death
two
or
three
things
happened
that
night
for
one
i
got
a
good
look
at
miss
julia
summers
she
was
and
with
an
ugly
face
but
a
pleasant
smile
she
wore
a
dress
that
made
miss
cobb
with
the
yoke
out
look
like
a
storm
collar
and
if
she
had
a
broken
heart
she
did
show
it
hello
she
cried
looking
at
my
hair
are
you
selling
tobacco
here
or
are
you
the
neither
i
answered
looking
over
her
head
i
am
employed
as
the
extinguisher
of
gay
guests
good
she
said
smiling
i
something
fine
at
that
myself
suppose
i
stay
here
and
help
if
i
watch
that
line
of
knitting
women
i
be
crotcheting
arabella
wool
in
my
sleep
well
she
was
too
cheerful
to
be
angry
with
so
she
stayed
around
for
a
while
and
it
was
amazing
how
much
tobacco
i
sold
that
evening
men
who
usually
bought
tobies
bought
the
best
cigars
and
when
jennings
came
up
scowling
and
i
handed
him
the
brand
he
smoked
for
years
she
took
one
clipped
the
end
of
it
as
neat
as
a
finger
nail
and
gave
it
to
him
holding
up
the
lighter
i
not
going
to
smoke
yet
young
woman
he
said
glaring
at
her
but
she
only
smiled
i
sorry
she
said
i
been
waiting
hungrily
until
some
discriminating
smoker
would
buy
one
of
those
and
light
it
i
love
the
aroma
and
he
stood
there
for
thirty
minutes
standing
mostly
on
one
foot
on
account
of
the
gouty
one
puffing
like
a
locomotive
with
her
sniffing
at
the
aroma
and
telling
him
how
lonely
she
felt
with
no
friends
around
and
just
recovering
from
a
severe
illness
at
eight
he
had
hutchins
bring
him
his
coat
and
he
and
miss
julia
took
arabella
the
dog
for
a
walk
on
the
veranda
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
quiet
and
i
needed
it
miss
patty
and
von
inwald
talked
by
the
fire
and
i
think
he
told
her
something
not
all
of
the
scene
in
the
for
she
passed
pierce
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
on
her
way
up
for
the
night
and
she
pretended
not
to
see
him
he
stood
there
looking
up
after
her
with
his
mouth
set
and
at
the
turn
she
glanced
down
and
caught
his
eye
i
thought
she
flushed
but
i
was
sure
and
at
that
minute
senator
biggs
bought
three
cigars
and
told
me
to
keep
the
change
from
a
dollar
i
was
so
surprised
at
the
alteration
in
him
that
i
forgot
miss
patty
entirely
about
twelve
just
after
i
went
to
my
room
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
when
i
opened
the
new
doctor
was
standing
in
the
hall
i
sorry
to
disturb
you
he
said
but
nobody
seems
to
know
where
the
pharmacy
clerk
is
and
i
have
to
get
some
medicine
if
i
had
my
way
we
have
had
a
bell
on
that
pharmacy
clerk
long
ago
i
snapped
getting
my
keys
who
sick
the
big
man
he
replied
biggs
is
his
name
i
think
a
senator
or
something
i
was
leading
the
way
to
the
stairs
but
i
stopped
i
might
have
known
it
i
said
he
has
been
natural
all
evening
what
the
matter
with
him
too
much
fast
fast
he
laughed
too
much
feast
he
got
as
pretty
a
case
of
indigestion
as
i
seen
for
some
time
he
giving
a
demonstration
that
almost
theatrical
well
he
insisted
it
was
indigestion
although
i
argued
that
it
possible
and
he
wanted
ipecac
i
have
seen
a
pharmacopoeia
for
so
long
that
i
would
know
one
if
i
met
it
he
declared
but
i
got
a
system
of
mnemonics
that
never
fails
ipecac
and
colic
both
end
with
i
never
forget
that
conjunction
it
was
pounded
in
and
poured
in
in
my
early
youth
well
the
pharmacy
was
locked
and
we
could
find
a
key
to
fit
it
and
when
i
suggested
mustard
and
warm
water
he
jumped
at
the
idea
fine
he
said
better
let
me
dish
out
the
and
you
take
my
job
lead
on
macduff
to
the
kitchen
although
it
was
only
midnight
there
was
not
a
soul
about
a
hall
leads
back
of
the
office
to
the
kitchen
and
pantries
and
there
was
a
low
light
there
but
the
rest
was
dark
we
bumped
through
the
diet
kitchen
and
into
the
scullery
when
we
found
we
had
no
matches
i
went
back
for
some
and
when
i
got
as
far
as
the
diet
kitchen
again
doctor
barnes
was
there
just
inside
the
door
sh
he
whispered
come
into
the
scullery
the
kitchen
is
dark
but
there
is
somebody
in
there
fumbling
around
striking
matches
i
suppose
you
do
have
such
things
as
burglars
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
well
somebody
had
broken
into
timmons
candy
store
a
week
before
and
stolen
a
box
of
and
a
hundred
and
i
told
him
so
in
a
whisper
anyhow
it
is
the
chef
i
said
he
had
a
row
with
the
bath
man
and
is
in
bed
with
a
cut
hand
and
a
black
eye
and
nobody
else
has
any
business
here
we
tiptoed
into
the
scullery
in
the
dark
just
then
somebody
knocked
a
kettle
down
in
the
kitchen
and
it
hit
the
stove
below
with
a
crash
whoever
was
there
swore
and
it
was
not
francois
who
expresses
his
feelings
mostly
in
french
this
was
english
there
a
little
window
from
the
kitchen
into
the
scullery
as
well
as
a
door
the
window
had
a
wooden
slide
and
it
was
open
an
inch
or
so
we
could
see
anything
but
we
could
hear
a
man
moving
around
once
he
struck
a
match
but
it
went
out
and
he
said
damn
again
and
began
to
feel
his
way
toward
the
scullery
doctor
barnes
happened
to
touch
my
hand
and
he
patted
it
as
if
to
tell
me
not
to
be
frightened
then
he
crept
toward
the
scullery
door
and
waited
there
it
swung
open
slowly
but
he
waited
until
it
closed
again
and
the
man
was
in
the
room
then
he
yelled
and
jumped
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
fall
i
could
hardly
strike
the
match
i
was
trembling
so
but
when
i
did
there
was
dick
lying
flat
on
the
floor
and
the
doctor
sitting
on
him
mister
dick
i
gasped
and
dropped
the
match
something
hit
me
dick
said
feebly
and
when
i
had
got
a
candle
lighted
and
had
explained
to
doctor
barnes
that
it
was
a
mistake
he
got
off
him
and
let
him
up
he
was
as
bewildered
as
dick
and
pretty
nearly
as
mad
we
put
him
dick
in
a
chair
and
gave
him
a
glass
of
water
and
after
he
had
got
his
breath
the
doctor
being
a
heavy
man
he
said
he
was
trying
to
find
something
to
eat
confound
it
minnie
he
exclaimed
we
starving
it
seems
to
me
there
are
enough
of
you
here
at
least
to
see
that
we
are
fed
not
a
bite
since
lunch
but
i
thought
you
had
the
basket
i
explained
i
left
it
at
the
and
when
i
went
back
it
was
gone
so
that
was
it
he
answered
and
then
he
explained
that
just
about
the
time
they
expected
their
supper
they
saw
a
man
carry
a
basket
stealthily
through
the
snow
to
the
deer
park
it
was
twilight
but
they
watched
him
from
the
window
and
he
put
the
basket
through
the
fence
and
then
crawled
after
it
just
inside
he
sat
down
on
a
log
and
opening
the
basket
began
to
eat
he
was
still
there
when
it
got
too
dark
to
see
him
if
that
was
our
dinner
he
finished
savagely
i
hope
he
choked
to
death
over
it
doctor
barnes
chuckled
he
did
he
said
but
he
got
the
worst
case
of
indigestion
in
seven
counties
well
i
got
the
mustard
and
water
ready
with
dick
standing
by
hoping
biggs
would
die
before
he
got
it
and
then
i
filled
a
basket
for
the
i
put
out
the
light
and
he
took
the
basket
and
started
out
but
he
came
back
in
a
hurry
there
somebody
outside
talking
he
said
i
went
to
the
door
with
him
and
listened
the
sooner
the
better
mike
was
saying
i
no
good
while
i
got
it
on
my
mind
and
thoburn
is
too
soon
they
not
in
the
mood
yet
perhaps
the
day
after
i
let
you
know
i
did
get
to
sleep
until
almost
morning
and
then
it
was
to
dream
that
pierce
was
shouting
hypocrites
to
all
the
people
in
the
sanatorium
and
threatening
to
throw
glasses
of
mustard
and
warm
water
at
them
chapter
xvii
a
bunch
of
letters
when
people
went
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
they
found
a
card
hanging
on
the
office
door
with
a
half
dozen
new
rules
on
it
and
when
i
went
out
to
the
the
guests
were
having
an
indignation
meeting
in
the
sun
parlor
with
the
bishop
in
the
chair
and
senator
biggs
so
wobbly
he
could
hardly
stand
making
a
speech
i
tried
to
see
pierce
but
early
as
it
was
he
had
gone
for
a
walk
taking
arabella
with
him
so
i
called
a
conference
at
the
miss
patty
and
van
alstyne
and
dick
and
myself
dick
was
dressed
but
she
sat
up
on
the
edge
of
her
cot
in
her
with
her
feet
on
the
soap
box
and
yawned
as
we
did
have
enough
chairs
miss
patty
jerked
the
soap
box
away
and
made
me
sit
down
dick
was
getting
breakfast
we
were
in
a
tight
place
and
we
knew
it
he
is
making
it
as
hard
for
us
as
he
can
sam
declared
the
idea
of
having
the
lights
put
out
at
midnight
and
the
breakfast
room
closed
at
ten
nobody
gets
up
at
that
hour
he
was
to
come
here
every
evening
for
orders
said
dick
measuring
ground
coffee
with
a
tablespoon
as
i
had
showed
him
he
came
just
once
and
as
for
orders
well
he
gave
to
me
but
miss
patty
was
always
fair
i
loathe
him
she
asserted
i
want
to
quarrel
with
him
the
minute
i
see
him
he
he
is
presumptuous
to
the
point
of
impertinence
but
honest
he
thinks
we
all
hypocrites
those
that
are
well
and
those
that
are
sick
or
think
they
are
and
he
hates
hypocrisy
everybody
talked
at
once
then
and
she
listened
very
well
she
said
i
amend
it
we
not
all
hypocrites
my
motives
in
all
this
are
perfectly
clear
and
selfish
you
and
old
pierce
would
make
a
fine
team
pat
dick
remarked
with
a
yawn
i
like
hypocrites
myself
they
so
comfy
but
if
not
above
advice
pat
you
have
aunt
honoria
break
her
neck
or
something
anything
to
get
father
back
to
town
something
is
going
to
explode
and
oskar
does
like
to
be
agitated
she
curled
up
on
the
cot
with
that
and
went
sound
asleep
the
rest
of
us
had
coffee
and
talked
but
there
was
anything
to
do
as
sam
said
pierce
did
want
to
stay
anyhow
and
as
likely
as
not
if
we
went
to
him
in
a
body
and
told
him
he
must
come
to
the
for
instructions
and
be
suave
and
gentle
when
he
was
called
down
by
the
guests
about
the
making
a
racket
he
probably
prefer
to
go
down
to
the
village
and
take
doctor
barnes
place
washing
dishes
at
the
station
that
would
call
for
any
particular
mildness
but
he
settled
it
by
appearing
himself
he
came
across
the
snow
from
the
direction
of
mount
hope
and
he
had
a
pair
of
skees
over
his
shoulder
at
that
time
i
did
even
know
the
name
of
the
things
but
i
learned
enough
about
them
later
i
must
say
he
looked
very
well
beside
dick
who
was
very
large
anyhow
and
who
had
had
time
to
put
on
his
collar
and
sam
who
always
thin
and
sallow
and
never
takes
a
step
he
does
have
to
i
let
him
in
and
when
he
saw
us
all
there
he
started
and
hesitated
come
in
pierce
sam
said
we
just
been
talking
about
you
he
came
in
but
he
did
look
very
comfortable
what
have
you
decided
to
do
with
me
he
asked
put
me
under
restraint
he
was
unbuttoning
his
sweater
and
now
he
took
out
two
of
the
smallest
rabbits
i
ever
saw
and
held
them
up
by
the
ears
miss
patty
gave
a
little
cry
and
took
them
cuddling
them
in
her
lap
they
starving
and
almost
frozen
poor
little
devils
he
said
i
found
them
near
where
i
shot
the
mother
last
night
minnie
and
by
way
of
atonement
i
going
to
adopt
them
well
although
the
minute
before
they
all
been
wishing
they
never
seen
him
they
pretty
nearly
ate
him
up
miss
patty
held
the
rabbits
so
we
all
had
turns
at
feeding
them
warm
milk
with
a
teaspoon
and
patting
their
pink
noses
when
it
came
pierce
turn
they
were
about
full
up
so
he
curled
his
big
body
on
the
floor
at
miss
patty
feet
and
talked
to
the
rabbits
and
looked
at
her
he
had
one
of
those
faces
that
got
every
emotion
marked
on
it
as
clear
as
a
barometer
when
he
was
mad
his
face
was
mad
all
over
and
when
he
was
pleased
he
glowed
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
and
he
was
pleased
that
morning
but
of
course
he
had
to
be
set
right
about
the
sanatorium
and
sam
began
it
pierce
listened
sitting
on
the
floor
and
looking
puzzled
and
more
and
more
unhappy
finally
he
got
up
and
drew
a
long
breath
exactly
he
agreed
i
know
you
are
all
right
and
i
wrong
according
to
your
way
of
thinking
but
if
these
people
want
to
be
well
why
should
i
encourage
them
to
do
the
wrong
thing
they
eat
too
much
they
exercise
he
turned
to
van
alstyne
why
do
you
know
i
asked
a
half
dozen
of
the
men
one
after
the
other
to
go
skeeing
with
me
this
morning
and
not
one
of
them
accepted
really
sam
exclaimed
mockingly
what
can
you
do
with
people
like
that
pierce
went
on
they
want
to
be
well
they
all
hypocrites
look
at
that
man
biggs
lay
you
ten
to
one
that
after
fasting
five
days
and
then
stealing
a
whole
chicken
a
dozen
oysters
and
lord
knows
what
else
now
that
sick
he
hold
it
against
me
he
not
holding
anything
i
objected
because
he
is
a
hypocrite
sam
began
that
not
the
point
pierce
dick
broke
in
importantly
you
were
to
come
here
for
orders
and
you
have
done
it
you
running
this
place
for
me
not
for
yourself
pierce
looked
at
dick
and
from
there
to
sam
and
smiled
i
did
come
he
explained
i
came
twice
and
each
time
we
played
roulette
i
lost
all
the
money
i
had
in
advance
honestly
he
confessed
i
felt
i
could
afford
to
come
every
day
miss
patty
got
up
and
put
the
baby
rabbits
into
her
sister
big
fur
muff
we
are
all
talking
around
the
question
she
said
pierce
undertook
to
manage
the
sanatorium
and
to
try
to
manage
it
successfully
he
can
not
do
that
without
making
some
attempt
at
conciliating
the
people
it
it
absurd
to
antagonize
them
exactly
he
said
coldly
i
was
to
manage
it
and
to
try
to
do
it
successfully
i
sorry
my
methods
do
meet
with
the
approval
of
this
er
executive
committee
but
it
might
as
well
be
clear
that
i
intend
to
use
my
own
methods
or
none
well
what
could
we
do
miss
patty
went
out
with
her
head
up
and
the
rest
of
us
stayed
and
ate
humble
pie
and
after
a
while
he
agreed
to
stay
if
he
was
interfered
with
he
said
he
and
doctor
barnes
had
a
plan
that
he
thought
was
a
winner
that
it
would
either
make
or
break
the
place
and
he
thought
it
would
make
it
and
by
that
time
we
were
so
meek
that
we
did
even
ask
what
it
was
doctor
barnes
and
miss
summers
were
the
first
to
come
to
the
mineral
spring
that
morning
she
stopped
just
inside
the
door
and
sniffed
something
dead
under
the
floor
she
said
if
there
anything
dead
doctor
barnes
replied
it
in
the
center
of
the
earth
that
the
sulphur
water
she
came
in
at
that
but
unwillingly
and
sat
down
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
nose
then
she
saw
me
good
gracious
she
exclaimed
what
have
you
done
that
they
put
you
here
if
you
mean
the
bouquet
from
the
spring
you
get
to
like
it
after
a
while
i
said
grimly
ordinary
air
has
got
any
snap
for
me
now
humph
she
looked
at
me
suspiciously
but
i
was
busy
wiping
off
the
tables
well
she
said
holding
up
the
glass
doctor
barnes
had
brought
her
it
does
cost
me
anything
so
here
goes
but
think
of
paying
money
for
it
she
drank
it
down
in
a
gulp
and
settled
herself
in
her
chair
what
it
do
to
me
she
asked
mixed
drinks
always
play
the
deuce
with
me
barnes
and
you
know
it
if
you
cut
down
your
diet
and
take
some
exercise
it
will
make
you
thin
i
began
process
is
painless
and
certain
kindly
nature
in
her
benevolent
plan
give
me
another
she
interrupted
and
doctor
barnes
filled
her
glass
again
some
women
spell
fate
she
said
looking
at
the
water
but
i
spell
it
without
the
she
took
half
of
it
and
then
put
down
the
glass
honestly
she
declared
i
rather
be
fat
pierce
met
them
there
a
few
minutes
later
and
they
had
a
chat
but
miss
summers
evidently
did
know
just
how
much
i
knew
and
was
careful
of
what
she
said
once
however
when
i
was
in
the
pantry
she
thought
i
was
beyond
good
heavens
pierce
she
said
if
they
could
put
that
in
a
play
cut
it
out
julia
doctor
barnes
snapped
and
it
was
until
they
had
gone
that
i
knew
she
meant
me
i
looked
through
the
crack
of
the
door
and
she
was
leaning
over
taking
a
puff
at
doctor
barnes
cigarette
curious
old
world
is
it
she
said
between
puffs
here
we
are
the
three
of
us
snug
and
nice
having
seven
kinds
of
water
and
not
having
to
pay
for
it
three
meals
a
day
and
afternoon
tea
ditto
good
beds
and
ditto
and
four
days
ago
where
were
we
pierce
you
were
hocking
your
clothes
doc
you
washing
dishes
he
said
i
never
knew
before
how
extravagant
it
is
to
have
a
saucer
under
a
cup
and
i
she
went
on
i
julia
summers
was
staring
at
a
ceiling
in
the
finleyville
hotel
with
a
face
that
looked
like
a
toy
balloon
and
now
said
doctor
barnes
you
are
more
beautiful
than
ever
i
am
a
successful
physician
oh
lord
julia
if
you
hear
me
faking
lines
in
my
part
and
my
young
friend
here
pierce
julia
pierce
has
now
become
a
young
reprobate
named
dicky
carter
and
may
the
lord
have
mercy
on
his
soul
i
tried
to
get
out
in
time
but
i
was
too
late
i
saw
her
rise
saw
the
glass
of
water
at
her
elbow
roll
over
and
smash
on
the
floor
and
saw
her
clutch
wildly
at
pierce
shoulder
not
not
dicky
carter
she
cried
richard
they
call
him
dick
pierce
said
uneasily
and
loosened
her
fingers
from
his
coat
oh
well
everybody
knows
it
now
how
she
called
dick
everything
in
the
calendar
and
then
began
to
cry
and
said
nobody
would
ever
know
what
she
been
through
with
and
the
very
dress
she
had
on
was
a
part
of
the
trousseau
she
had
made
and
what
with
the
dressmaker
bills
suddenly
she
stopped
crying
where
is
he
anyhow
she
demanded
all
we
are
sure
of
pierce
replied
quietly
is
that
he
is
not
in
the
sanatorium
she
looked
at
us
all
closely
but
she
got
nothing
from
my
face
oh
very
well
she
said
shrugging
her
shoulders
i
wait
until
he
shows
up
it
does
cost
anything
then
with
one
of
her
easy
changes
she
laughed
and
picked
up
her
muff
to
go
minnie
and
i
she
said
will
tend
bar
here
and
in
our
leisure
moments
we
will
pour
sulphur
water
on
a
bunch
of
dicky
letters
that
i
have
to
cool
she
walked
to
the
door
and
turned
around
smiling
carry
fire
insurance
on
all
the
time
she
finished
and
went
out
leaving
us
staring
at
one
another
chapter
xviii
miss
cobb
burglar
i
went
to
bed
early
that
night
what
with
worrying
and
being
alternately
chilled
by
tramping
through
the
snow
and
roasted
as
if
i
was
sitting
on
a
volcano
with
an
eruption
due
i
was
about
all
in
we
been
obliged
to
tell
sam
about
the
summers
woman
and
i
had
to
put
hot
flannels
on
her
from
nine
to
ten
she
was
quieter
when
i
left
her
but
as
i
told
sam
it
was
the
stillness
of
despair
not
resignation
i
guess
it
was
about
four
in
the
morning
when
a
hand
slid
over
my
face
and
i
sat
up
and
yelled
the
hand
covered
my
mouth
at
that
and
something
long
and
white
and
very
thin
beside
the
bed
said
sh
for
heaven
sake
minnie
it
was
miss
cobb
it
was
lucky
i
came
to
my
senses
when
i
did
for
her
knees
gave
way
under
her
just
then
and
she
doubled
up
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
with
her
face
in
my
comfort
i
lighted
a
candle
and
set
it
on
a
chair
beside
the
bed
and
took
a
good
look
at
her
she
was
shaking
all
over
which
was
strange
for
i
sleep
with
my
window
open
and
she
had
a
key
in
her
hand
here
she
gasped
holding
out
the
key
here
minnie
wake
the
house
and
get
him
but
oh
minnie
for
heaven
sake
save
my
reputation
get
who
i
demanded
for
i
saw
it
was
her
room
key
i
have
been
coming
here
for
ten
years
she
groaned
out
of
the
comfort
and
now
to
be
bandied
about
by
the
cold
breath
of
scandal
i
shook
her
by
the
shoulder
the
cold
breath
you
are
raving
about
is
four
degrees
below
zero
if
you
ca
tell
me
what
the
matter
i
going
back
to
bed
and
cover
my
feet
she
got
up
at
that
and
stood
swaying
with
her
nightgown
flapping
around
her
like
a
tent
i
have
locked
a
man
in
my
room
she
declared
in
a
terrible
voice
and
collapsed
into
the
middle
of
the
bed
well
i
leaned
over
and
tried
to
tell
her
she
made
a
mistake
the
more
i
looked
at
her
with
her
hair
standing
straight
out
over
her
head
and
her
cambric
nightgown
with
a
high
collar
and
long
sleeves
and
the
hump
on
her
nose
where
her
brother
willie
had
hit
her
in
childhood
with
a
baseball
bat
the
surer
i
was
that
somebody
had
made
a
mistake
likely
the
man
now
there
two
ways
to
handle
a
situation
like
that
one
of
them
is
to
rouse
the
house
and
many
a
good
sanatorium
has
been
hurt
by
a
scandal
and
killed
by
a
divorce
the
other
way
is
to
take
one
strong
man
who
can
hold
his
tongue
find
the
guilty
person
and
send
him
a
fake
telegram
the
next
morning
that
his
mother
is
sick
i
done
that
more
than
once
i
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
put
on
my
slippers
what
did
he
look
like
i
asked
could
you
see
him
she
uncovered
one
eye
not
not
distinctly
she
said
i
think
he
was
large
and
and
rather
handsome
that
beast
of
a
dog
must
have
got
in
my
room
and
was
asleep
under
the
bed
for
it
wakened
me
by
snarling
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
make
me
nervous
but
it
did
as
i
put
on
my
kimono
i
was
thinking
pretty
hard
i
could
not
waken
pierce
by
knocking
so
i
went
in
and
shook
him
he
was
sound
asleep
with
his
arms
over
his
head
and
when
i
caught
his
shoulder
he
just
took
my
hand
and
turning
over
tucked
it
under
his
cheek
and
went
asleep
again
pierce
mr
pierce
he
wakened
a
little
at
that
but
not
enough
to
open
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
know
that
the
hand
was
his
however
for
he
kissed
it
and
with
that
i
slapped
him
and
he
wakened
he
lay
there
blinking
at
my
candle
and
then
he
yawned
musht
have
been
ashleep
he
said
and
turned
over
on
his
other
side
and
shut
his
eyes
it
was
two
or
three
minutes
at
least
before
i
had
him
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
with
a
blanket
spread
over
his
knees
and
was
telling
him
about
miss
cobb
miss
cobb
he
said
oh
heavens
minnie
tell
her
to
go
back
to
bed
he
yawned
if
there
anybody
there
it
a
mistake
i
sleepy
what
time
is
it
i
not
going
out
of
this
room
until
you
get
up
i
declared
grimly
oh
very
well
he
said
and
put
his
feet
back
into
bed
if
you
think
i
going
to
get
up
while
you
here
after
he
seemed
pretty
well
wakened
i
went
out
i
waited
in
the
and
i
heard
him
growling
as
he
put
on
his
clothes
when
he
came
out
however
he
was
more
cheerful
and
he
stopped
in
the
hall
to
fish
a
case
out
of
sam
pocket
and
light
a
cigarette
now
he
said
taking
my
arm
forward
the
clad
brigade
but
he
stopped
minnie
we
are
unarmed
shall
i
get
the
patent
folding
corkscrew
he
had
to
be
quiet
when
we
got
to
the
bedroom
floors
however
and
when
we
stopped
outside
miss
cobb
door
he
was
as
sober
as
any
one
could
wish
him
you
need
come
in
he
whispered
ten
to
one
she
dreamed
it
but
if
she
did
you
better
outside
and
whatever
you
hear
do
yell
i
gave
him
the
key
and
he
fitted
it
quietly
in
the
lock
arabella
just
inside
must
have
heard
for
she
snarled
but
the
snarl
turned
into
a
yelp
as
if
she
been
suddenly
kicked
pierce
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
turned
and
looked
at
me
in
the
then
he
opened
the
door
arabella
gave
another
yelp
and
rushed
out
she
went
between
my
feet
like
a
shot
and
almost
overthrew
me
and
when
i
got
my
balance
again
i
looked
into
the
room
pierce
was
at
the
window
staring
out
and
the
room
was
empty
the
idiot
pierce
said
if
it
had
been
for
that
snowbank
here
give
me
that
candle
he
stood
there
waving
it
in
circles
but
there
was
neither
sight
nor
sound
from
below
after
a
minute
pierce
put
the
window
down
and
we
stared
at
the
room
all
the
bureau
drawers
were
out
on
the
floor
and
the
lid
of
poor
miss
cobb
trunk
was
open
and
the
tray
upset
but
her
brush
was
still
on
the
bureau
and
the
ring
the
insurance
agent
had
given
her
lay
beside
it
we
brought
her
back
to
her
room
and
she
did
know
whether
to
be
happy
that
she
was
vindicated
or
mad
at
the
state
her
things
were
in
i
tucked
her
up
in
bed
after
she
gone
over
her
belongings
and
pierce
had
the
window
and
gone
out
she
drew
my
head
down
to
her
and
her
eyes
were
fairly
popping
out
of
her
head
i
feel
as
though
i
going
crazy
minnie
she
whispered
but
the
only
things
that
are
gone
are
my
letters
from
jones
and
my
black
woolen
tights
chapter
xix
no
marriage
in
heaven
i
slept
late
the
next
morning
and
when
i
had
breakfast
and
waded
to
the
it
was
nearly
nine
it
was
still
snowing
and
no
papers
or
mail
had
got
through
although
the
wires
were
still
in
fair
working
order
as
i
floundered
out
i
thought
i
saw
somebody
slink
around
the
corner
of
the
but
when
i
got
there
nobody
was
in
sight
i
was
on
my
knees
in
front
of
the
fireplace
raking
out
the
fire
when
i
heard
the
door
close
behind
me
and
when
i
turned
there
stood
dick
muffled
to
the
neck
with
his
hat
almost
over
his
face
what
the
deuce
kept
you
so
late
this
morning
he
demanded
in
a
sulky
voice
and
limping
over
to
a
table
he
drew
a
package
out
of
his
pocket
and
slammed
it
on
the
table
i
was
up
half
the
night
as
usual
i
said
rising
you
ought
to
be
here
mr
dick
he
caught
hold
of
the
rail
around
the
spring
and
hobbling
about
dropped
into
a
chair
with
a
groan
for
two
cents
he
declared
i
chop
a
hole
in
the
ice
pond
and
drown
myself
there
no
marriage
in
heaven
that
no
argument
for
the
other
place
i
answered
and
stopped
staring
he
was
pulling
something
out
of
his
overcoat
pocket
an
inch
at
a
time
for
god
sake
minnie
he
exclaimed
return
this
this
garment
to
whomever
it
belongs
to
he
handed
it
to
me
and
it
was
miss
cobb
black
tights
i
stood
and
stared
and
then
he
went
on
reaching
for
the
package
on
the
table
when
you
done
that
return
to
these
letters
from
her
jonesie
he
took
the
newspaper
off
the
bundle
then
and
i
saw
it
was
wrapped
with
a
lavender
ribbon
i
sat
down
and
gazed
at
him
fascinated
he
was
the
piece
of
remorse
i
seen
for
a
long
time
and
when
you
got
your
breath
back
minnie
he
said
feebly
and
your
strength
would
you
mind
taking
the
floor
mop
and
hitting
me
a
few
cracks
only
not
on
the
right
leg
minnie
not
on
the
right
leg
i
landed
on
it
last
night
it
twisted
like
a
pretzel
do
stand
and
stare
he
continued
irritably
when
i
did
make
a
move
at
least
get
that
that
infernal
black
garment
out
of
sight
cover
it
with
the
newspaper
and
if
you
do
believe
that
a
young
girl
like
my
wife
has
a
positive
talent
for
wickedness
and
suspicion
go
out
to
the
this
morning
so
it
was
you
i
gasped
putting
the
newspaper
over
the
tights
why
in
the
name
of
peace
did
you
jump
out
the
window
and
what
did
you
want
with
with
these
things
he
twisted
around
in
his
chair
to
stare
at
me
and
then
stooped
and
clutched
frantically
at
his
leg
as
if
for
inspiration
want
with
those
things
he
snarled
i
suppose
you
ca
understand
that
a
man
might
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
a
mad
craving
for
a
pair
of
black
woolen
tights
and
you
need
be
sarcastic
with
me
i
broke
in
you
can
save
that
for
your
wife
i
suppose
you
also
had
a
wild
longing
for
the
of
an
insurance
agent
and
then
it
dawned
on
me
and
i
sat
down
and
laughed
until
i
cried
and
you
thought
you
were
stealing
your
own
letters
i
cried
the
ones
she
carries
fire
insurance
on
oh
dick
mr
dick
how
was
i
to
know
it
was
ju
miss
summers
room
he
demanded
angrily
did
i
follow
the
dratted
dog
and
would
you
have
thought
the
wretched
beast
would
have
known
me
instead
of
sitting
on
its
tail
under
the
bed
and
yelling
for
mother
i
gave
her
the
dog
myself
oh
i
tell
you
minnie
if
i
ever
get
away
from
this
place
you
got
to
get
away
this
minute
i
broke
in
remembering
be
coming
any
instant
now
he
got
up
and
looked
around
him
helplessly
where
i
go
he
asked
i
ca
go
back
to
the
i
looked
at
him
and
he
tried
to
grin
fact
he
said
hard
to
believe
but
fact
minnie
she
got
the
door
locked
did
i
tell
you
she
is
of
a
suspicious
nature
she
was
asleep
when
i
left
and
mostly
she
sleeps
all
night
and
just
because
she
wakes
when
i
out
and
lets
me
come
in
thinking
she
asleep
when
she
has
one
eye
open
all
the
time
and
she
sees
what
i
never
even
seen
myself
that
the
string
of
that
damned
garment
whatever
it
is
is
fastened
to
the
hook
of
my
shoe
me
thinking
all
the
time
that
the
weight
was
because
i
broken
my
leg
jumping
does
she
suddenly
sit
up
and
ask
me
where
i
been
and
i
i
unsuspicious
minnie
by
nature
and
i
said
i
been
asleep
then
she
jumped
up
and
showed
me
that
that
thing
those
things
hanging
to
my
shoe
and
she
spoken
to
me
since
i
wish
i
was
dead
and
just
then
a
dog
barked
outside
and
somebody
on
the
step
stamped
the
snow
off
his
feet
we
were
both
paralyzed
for
a
moment
julia
dick
cried
and
went
white
i
made
a
leap
for
the
door
just
as
the
handle
turned
and
put
my
back
against
it
just
a
minute
i
called
the
carpet
is
caught
under
it
dick
had
lost
his
head
and
was
making
for
the
spring
as
if
he
thought
hiding
his
feet
would
conceal
him
i
made
frantic
gestures
to
him
to
go
into
my
pantry
and
he
went
at
last
leaving
his
hat
on
the
table
i
left
the
door
and
flung
it
after
him
the
hat
of
course
not
the
door
and
when
miss
summers
sauntered
in
just
after
i
was
on
my
knees
brushing
the
hearth
with
my
heart
going
time
and
skipping
every
sixth
beat
hello
she
said
lovely
weather
for
polar
bears
if
the
natives
wade
through
this
all
winter
it
no
wonder
they
walk
as
if
they
are
do
bother
getting
me
a
glass
i
get
my
own
she
was
making
for
the
pantry
when
i
caught
her
and
i
guess
i
looked
pretty
wild
i
get
it
i
said
i
that
one
of
the
rules
she
put
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
white
sweater
and
smiled
at
me
do
you
know
she
declared
the
old
ladies
knitting
society
so
far
wrong
about
you
about
your
making
rules
whatever
you
want
whenever
you
want
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
now
she
went
on
suppose
i
break
that
rule
and
get
my
own
glass
what
happens
to
me
i
do
think
i
be
put
out
i
threw
up
my
hands
in
despair
for
i
was
about
at
the
end
of
my
string
get
it
then
i
exclaimed
and
sat
down
waiting
for
the
volcano
to
erupt
but
she
only
laughed
and
sat
down
on
a
table
swinging
her
feet
when
you
know
me
better
minnie
she
said
you
know
i
do
spoil
sport
i
happen
to
know
you
have
somebody
in
the
pantry
moreover
i
know
it
a
man

are
tracks
on
the
little
porch

dear
girl
not
made
by
your
galoshes
also
my
dearest
girl
there
a
glove
by
your
chair
there
i
put
my
foot
on
it
and
just
to
show
you
what
a
good
fellow
i
am
she
got
off
the
table
still
smiling
and
sauntered
to
the
pantry
door
watching
me
over
her
shoulder
do
be
alarmed
she
called
through
the
door
i
not
coming
in
i
shall
take
my
little
drink
of
nature
benevolent
remedy
out
of
the
tin
ladle
and
then
i
shall
take
my
departure
my
heart
was
skipping
every
second
beat
by
that
time
and
miss
julia
stood
by
the
pantry
door
her
head
back
and
her
eyes
almost
closed
enjoying
every
minute
of
it
if
arabella
had
made
a
diversion
just
then
i
think
i
have
fainted
she
pulled
the
newspaper
and
the
tights
off
the
table
and
was
running
around
the
room
with
them
one
leg
in
her
mouth
stop
it
arabella
said
miss
julia
and
took
the
tights
from
her
yours
she
asked
with
her
eyebrows
raised
no
yes
i
answered
i
never
have
suspected
you
of
them
she
remarked
hardly
sheer
enough
to
pull
through
a
finger
ring
are
they
she
held
them
up
and
gazed
at
them
meditatively
that
one
thing
i
draw
the
line
at
on
the
boards
you
know
never
have
worn
and
never
will
they
not
modest
to
my
mind
and
anyhow
i
too
fat
sam
and
his
wife
came
in
at
that
moment
sam
carrying
a
bottle
of
wine
for
the
wrapped
in
a
paper
and
two
cans
of
something
or
other
he
was
too
busy
trying
to
make
the
bottle
look
like
something
else
which
a
good
many
people
have
tried
and
failed
at
to
notice
what
miss
summers
was
doing
and
she
had
miss
cobb
protectors
stuffed
in
her
muff
and
was
standing
very
dignified
in
front
of
the
fire
by
the
time
they
shaken
off
the
snow
good
morning
she
said
morning
said
sam
hanging
up
his
overcoat
with
one
hand
and
trying
to
put
the
bottle
in
one
of
the
pockets
with
the
other
sam
did
look
at
her
good
morning
van
alstyne
miss
summers
almost
threw
it
at
her
i
spoke
to
you
before
i
guess
you
did
hear
me
oh
yes
i
heard
you
answered
sam
and
turned
her
back
on
her
give
me
a
little
woman
for
sheer
devilishness
i
expected
to
see
miss
summers
fly
to
pieces
with
rage
but
she
stared
at
sam
back
and
after
a
minute
she
laughed
i
see
she
remarked
slowly
you
the
sister
are
you
sam
had
given
up
trying
to
hide
the
bottle
and
now
he
set
it
on
the
floor
with
a
thump
and
came
over
to
the
fire
it
you
see
the
situation
is
embarrassing
he
began
if
we
had
had
any
idea
i
might
have
been
still
in
the
finleyville
hotel
she
finished
for
him
awful
thought
is
it
under
the
circumstances
went
on
sam
nervously
do
you
think
it
would
be
er
better
form
if
er
under
the
circumstances
i
thinking
of
my
circumstances
she
put
in
if
you
imagine
that
six
weeks
of
stands
has
left
me
anything
but
a
rural
wardrobe
and
a
box
of
dog
biscuit
for
arabella
you
pretty
well
mistaken
i
have
even
a
decent
costume
all
we
had
left
after
the
sheriff
got
through
was
some
grass
mats
a
checked
sunbonnet
and
a
pump
minnie
sam
said
coldly
that
little
beast
of
a
dog
is
trying
to
drink
out
of
the
spring
i
caught
her
in
time
and
gave
her
a
good
slapping
when
i
looked
up
miss
summers
was
glaring
down
at
me
over
the
rail
just
what
do
you
mean
by
hitting
my
dog
she
demanded
it
was
the
first
time
i
seen
her
angry
just
what
i
appeared
to
mean
i
answered
if
you
want
to
take
it
as
a
love
pat
you
may
and
i
stalked
to
the
door
and
threw
the
creature
out
into
the
snow
it
was
the
first
false
step
that
day
if
i
known
what
putting
that
dog
out
meant
i
do
allow
dogs
here
i
said
and
shut
the
door
miss
summers
was
furious
she
turned
and
stared
at
sam
who
was
smiling
at
the
fire
let
arabella
in
she
said
to
me
in
an
undertone
or
i
open
the
pantry
door
open
the
door
i
retorted
i
was
half
hysterical
but
it
was
no
time
to
weaken
she
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
for
fully
ten
seconds
then
to
my
surprise
she
winked
at
me
but
when
she
turned
on
sam
she
was
cold
rage
again
and
nothing
else
i
am
not
going
to
leave
if
that
is
what
you
are
about
to
suggest
she
said
i
been
trying
to
see
dicky
carter
the
last
ten
days
and
stay
here
until
i
see
him
it
a
delicate
situation
delicate
she
snapped
it
indelicate
it
indecent
that
what
it
is
did
i
get
my
clothes
and
were
we
to
have
been
married
by
the
reverend
dwight
johnstone
out
in
salem
ohio
and
did
he
go
out
there
and
have
old
johnstone
marry
him
to
somebody
else
the
wretch
if
i
ever
see
him
a
glass
dropped
in
the
pantry
and
smashed
but
nobody
paid
any
attention
oh
i
not
going
until
he
comes
she
continued
i
stay
right
here
and
i
have
what
coming
to
me
or
i
know
the
reason
why
do
forget
for
a
minute
that
i
know
why
pierce
is
here
and
that
i
can
spoil
the
little
game
by
calling
the
extra
ace
if
i
want
to
you
forgetting
one
thing
sam
said
facing
her
for
the
first
time
if
you
call
the
game
my
brother
is
worth
exactly
what
clothes
he
happens
to
be
wearing
at
the
moment
and
nothing
else
he
has
a
penny
of
his
own
i
do
believe
it
she
sniffed
look
at
the
things
he
gave
me
yes
i
already
had
the
bills
said
sam
she
whirled
and
looked
at
him
and
then
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
you
she
said
why
bless
my
soul
all
the
expense
of
a
double
life
and
none
of
its
advantages
she
went
out
on
that
still
laughing
leaving
sam
scarlet
with
rage
and
when
she
was
safely
gone
i
brought
dick
out
to
the
fire
he
was
so
limp
he
could
hardly
walk
and
it
took
three
glasses
of
the
wine
and
all
sam
could
do
to
start
him
back
to
the
his
sister
would
not
speak
to
him
mike
went
to
pierce
that
day
and
asked
for
a
raise
of
salary
he
did
not
get
it
perhaps
as
things
have
turned
out
it
was
for
the
best
but
it
is
strange
to
think
how
different
things
would
have
been
if
he
been
given
it
he
was
sent
up
later
of
course
for
six
months
for
malicious
mischief
but
by
that
time
the
damage
was
done
chapter
xx
every
dog
has
his
day
that

on
a
saturday
morning
during
the
golf

in
hours
but
in
the
winter
saturday
is
the
same
as
any
other
day
it
had
stopped
snowing
and
the
sun
was
shining
although
it
was
so
cold
that
the
snow
blew
like
powder
by
eleven
every
one
who
could
walk
had
come
to
the
even
jennings

down
in
a
wheeled
chair
and
senator
biggs
still
looking
a
sort
of
and
keeping
his
eyes
off
me
came
and
sat
in
a
corner
with
a
book
called
fast
versus
feast
held
so
that
every
one
could
see
there
were
bridge
tables
going
and
five
hundred
and
a
group
around
the
while
the
crocheters
formed
a
crowd
by
themselves
exchanging
gossip
and
new
stitches
about
twelve
thoburn
came
in
and
as
he
opened
the
door
in
leaped
arabella
the
women
made
a
fuss
over
the
creature
and
cuddled
her
and
when
i
tried
to
put
her
out
everybody
objected
so
she
stayed
and
miss
summers
put
her
through
a
lot
of
tricks
while
the
men
crowded
around
as
i
said
before
miss
summers
was
a
first
favorite
with
the
men
von
inwald

inwald
i
propose
as
a
reward
to
miss
arabella
a
glass
of
this
wonderful
water
minnie
a
glass
of
water
for
arabella
she
does
drink
out
of
one
of
my
glasses
i
declared
angrily
it
one
of
my
rules
that
dogs
tut
said
thoburn
what
good
for
man
is
good
for
beast
besides
the
little
beggar
thirsty
well
they
made
a
great
fuss
about
the
creature
being
thirsty
and
so
finally
i
got
a
panful
of
spring
water
and
it
drank
until
i
thought
it
would
burst
i
not
vicious
as
i
say
but
i
wish
it
had
well
the
dog
finished
and
lay
down
by
the
fire
and
everything
seemed
to
go
on
as
before
thoburn
was
in
a
good
humor
and
he
came
over
to
the
spring
and
brought
a
trayful
of
glasses
to
save
you
steps
minnie
he
explained
you
have
no
idea
how
it
pains
me
to
see
you
working
gentlemen
name
your
poison
a
frappe
with
on
the
side
moody
snarled
from
the
if
i
drink
much
more
i
have
to
be
hooped
up
like
a
barrel
just
what
is
the
record
here
the
bishop
asked
i
ordered
eight
glasses
but
i
find
it
more
than
a
sufficiency
we
had
one
man
here
once
who
could
drink
at
a
time
i
said
but
he
was
a
german
he
was
a
tank
sam
corrected
grumpily
he
was
watching
something
on
the
floor
i
could
see
what
all
i
need
is
to
swallow
a
few
goldfish
and
i
be
a
aquarium
what
i
think
we
should
do
miss
cobb
said
is
to
try
to
find
out
just
what
suits
us
and
stick
to
that
i
always
trying
damned
trying
jennings
snarled
and
limped
over
for
more
water
i
like
to
know
where
to
go
for
rheumatism
i
got
mine
here
said
thoburn
cheerfully
it
my
opinion
this
place
is
rheumatic
as
well
as
malarious
and
as
for
this
water
with
all
due
respect
to
the
spirit
in
the
spring
he
bowed
to
me
i
think
an
insult
to
ask
people
to
drink
it
it
is
half
so
strong
as
it
was
two
years
ago
taste
it
smell
it
i
ask
the
old
friends
of
the
sanatorium
is
that
water
what
it
used
to
be
do
tell
me
it
was
ever
any
worse
than
this
miss
summers
exclaimed
but
thoburn
went
on
the
stopped
to
listen
but
sam
was
still
staring
at
something
on
the
floor
i
tell
you
the
spring
is
losing
its
virtue
and
like
a
woman
without
virtue
it
is
worthless
but
interesting
sam
said
and
stooped
down
consider
went
on
thoburn
standing
and
holding
his
glass
to
the
light
how
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
this
little
spring
a
convulsion
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
its
properties
may
be
changed
to
the
direst
poison
how
do
we
know
you
and
i
some
such
change
has
not
occurred
overnight
unlikely
as
it
is
it
a
possibility
that
sitting
here
calmly
we
may
be
sipping
our
death
potion
some
of
the
people
actually
put
down
their
glasses
and
everybody
began
to
look
uneasy
except
sam
who
was
still
watching
something
i
could
not
see
thoburn
looked
around
and
saw
he
made
an
impression
we
may
he
continued
although
my
personal
opinion
of
this
water
is
that
growing
too
weak
to
be
wicked
i
prove
my
faith
in
mother
nature
if
it
is
poisoned
i
am
gone
i
drink
sam
suddenly
straightened
up
and
glanced
at
miss
summers
perhaps
i
mistaken
he
said
but
i
think
there
is
something
the
matter
with
arabella
everybody
looked
arabella
was
lying
on
her
back
jerking
and
twitching
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
she
been
poisoned
miss
summers
screeched
and
fell
on
her
knees
beside
her
it
that
wretched
water
there
was
pretty
nearly
a
riot
in
a
minute
everybody
jumped
up
and
stared
at
the
dog
and
everybody
remembered
the
water
he
or
she
had
just
had
and
coming
on
top
of
thoburn
speech
it
made
them
babbling
lunatics
as
i
look
back
i
have
a
sort
of
picture
of
miss
summers
on
the
floor
with
arabella
in
her
lap
and
the
rest
telling
how
much
of
the
water
they
had
had
and
crowding
around
thoburn
it
seems
hardly
likely
it
was
the
water
he
said
although
from
what
i
recall
of
my
chemistry
it
is
distinctly
possible
springs
have
been
known
to
change
their
character
and
the
coincidence
the
dog
and
the
water
is
certainly
startling
still
as
nobody
feels
ill
but
they
were
sure
they
did
the
bishop
said
he
felt
perfectly
well
but
he
had
a
strange
inclination
to
yawn
all
the
time
and
biggs
left
arm
had
gone
to
sleep
and
then
with
the
excitement
and
all
miss
cobb
took
a
violent
pain
in
the
back
of
her
neck
and
know
whether
to
cry
or
to
laugh
well
i
did
what
i
could
the
worst
of
it
was
i
was
sure
it
the
water
i
thought
possibly
pierce
had
made
a
mistake
in
what
he
had
bought
at
the
drug
store
and
although
i
do
as
a
rule
drink
it
myself
i
began
to
feel
queer
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
thoburn
came
over
to
the
spring
and
filling
a
glass
took
it
to
the
light
with
every
one
watching
anxiously
when
he
brought
it
back
he
stooped
over
the
railing
and
whispered
to
me
when
did
you
fix
it
he
asked
sternly
last
night
i
answered
it
was
no
time
to
beat
about
the
bush
it
yellower
than
usual
he
said
i
inclined
to
think
something
has
gone
wrong
at
the
drug
store
minnie
i
could
hardly
breathe
i
had
the
most
terrible
vision
of
all
the
guests
lying
around
like
arabella
twitching
and
foaming
and
me
going
to
prison
as
a
wholesale
murderess
any
hair
but
mine
would
have
turned
gray
in
that
minute
von
inwald
was
watching
like
the
others
and
now
he
came
over
and
caught
thoburn
by
the
arm
what
do
you
think
he
asked
nervously
i
i
have
had
three
glasses
of
it
three
shouted
senator
biggs
coming
forward
i
had
eleven
i
tell
you
i
been
feeling
queer
for
hours
i
poisoned
what
i
am
he
staggered
out
with
biggs
just
behind
him
and
from
that
moment
they
were
all
demoralized
i
stood
by
the
spring
and
sipped
at
the
water
to
show
i
was
afraid
of
it
with
my
knees
shaking
under
me
and
arabella
lying
as
if
she
had
died
under
my
very
nose
one
by
one
they
left
to
look
for
doctor
barnes
or
to
get
the
white
of
egg
which
somebody
had
suggested
as
an
antidote
miss
cobb
was
one
of
the
last
to
go
she
turned
in
the
doorway
and
looked
back
at
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
it
is
your
fault
minnie
she
said
and
forgive
me
if
i
have
ever
said
anything
unkind
to
you
then
she
went
and
i
was
alone
looking
down
at
arabella
or
rather
i
thought
i
was
alone
for
there
was
a
movement
by
one
of
the
windows
and
miss
patty
came
forward
and
knelt
by
the
dog
of
all
the
absurdities
she
said
poor
little
thing
minnie
i
believe
she
breathing
she
put
the
dog
head
in
her
lap
and
the
little
beast
opened
its
eyes
and
tried
to
wag
its
blue
tail
oh
miss
patty
miss
patty
i
exclaimed
and
i
got
down
beside
her
and
cried
on
her
shoulder
with
her
stroking
my
hand
and
calling
me
dearest
me
i
was
wiping
my
eyes
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
pierce
ran
in
he
had
no
hat
on
and
his
hair
was
powdered
with
snow
he
stopped
just
inside
the
door
and
looked
at
miss
patty
you
he
said
you
are
all
right
you
are
not
he
came
forward
and
stood
over
her
with
his
heart
in
his
eyes
she
must
have
known
from
that
minute
my
god
he
exclaimed
i
thought
you
were
poisoned
she
looked
up
without
smiling
and
then
i
thought
she
half
shut
her
eyes
as
if
what
she
saw
in
his
face
hurt
her
i
am
all
right
she
assured
him
and
little
arabella
will
be
all
right
too
she
had
a
convulsion
that
all
probably
from
overeating
as
for
the
others
where
is
the
where
is
von
inwald
he
has
gone
to
take
the
white
of
an
egg
she
replied
rather
haughtily
she
was
too
honest
to
evade
anything
but
she
flushed
of
course
i
knew
what
he
did
that
the
prince
had
been
among
the
first
to
scurry
to
the
house
and
that
he
had
even
waited
for
her
he
walked
to
the
window
as
if
he
did
want
her
to
see
what
he
thought
of
that
and
i
saw
him
looking
hard
at
something
outside
in
the
snow
when
he
walked
back
to
the
fire
he
was
smiling
and
he
stooped
over
and
poked
arabella
with
his
finger
so
that
was
it
he
said
full
to
the
scuppers
poor
little
wretch
minnie
i
am
hoist
with
my
own
petard
which
in
this
case
was
a
boomerang
which
is
in
english
i
asked
with
the
instinct
of
her
sex
arabella
has
unearthed
what
was
meant
to
be
buried
forever
she
had
gorged
herself
into
a
convulsion
on
that
rabbit
i
shot
last
night
chapter
xxi
the
mutiny
they
went
to
the
house
together
he
carrying
arabella
like
a
sick
baby
and
miss
patty
beside
him
as
far
as
i
could
see
they
did
speak
a
word
to
each
other
but
once
or
twice
i
saw
her
turn
and
look
up
at
him
as
if
she
was
puzzled
i
closed
the
door
and
stood
just
inside
looking
at
father
picture
over
the
mantel
as
sure
as
i
stood
there
the
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
spring
and
i
sensed
as
you
may
say
what
they
meant
i
went
over
and
looked
down
into
the
spring
and
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
darker
than
usual
it
may
have
smelled
stronger
but
the
edge
had
been
taken
off
my
nose
so
to
speak
by
being
there
so
long
from
the
spring
i
looked
again
at
father
and
his
eyes
were
on
me
mournful
and
sad
i
felt
as
though
if
he
been
there
father
would
have
turned
the
whole
affair
to
the
advantage
of
the
house
and
it
was
almost
more
than
i
could
bear
i
was
only
glad
the
old
enlargement
had
not
come
yet
i
could
have
endured
having
it
see
what
had
occurred
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
was
to
empty
the
spring
and
let
the
water
come
in
plain
i
could
put
a
little
sulphur
in
to
give
it
color
and
flavor
and
if
it
turned
out
that
pierce
was
right
and
that
arabella
was
only
a
glutton
i
could
put
in
the
other
things
later
i
was
carrying
out
my
first
pailful
when
doctor
barnes
came
down
the
path
and
took
the
pail
out
of
my
hand
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
making
a
slide
no
i
said
bitterly
i
am
watering
the
flowers
good
he
was
not
a
bit
put
out
let
me
help
you
he
took
the
pail
across
the
path
and
poured
a
little
into
the
snow
at
the
base
of
a
fence
posts
there
he
said
coming
back
triumphant
the
roses
are
done
now
let
have
a
go
at
the
pansies
and
the
and
the
the
begonias
i
say
he
stopped
suddenly
on
his
way
in
sulphur
water
on
a
begonia
what
would
it
make
skunk
cabbage
inside
however
he
put
down
the
pail
and
pulling
me
in
closed
the
door
now
forget
it
he
commanded
just
because
a
lot
of
damn
fools
see
a
dog
in
a
fit
and
have
one
too
is
that
any
reason
for
your
being
scared
and
i
not
i
snapped
well
you
with
fright
he
insisted
of
course
the
best
judge
of
your
own
knees
but
after
last
night
had
any
lunch
i
shook
my
head
exactly
he
said
you
make
me
think
of
the
little
boy
who
dug
in
the
daytime
and
took
in
washings
at
night
to
support
the
family
sit
down
i
sat
inhale
and
exhale
slowly
four
times
and
then
swallow
the
lump
in
your
throat
gone
yes
good
he
was
fumbling
in
his
pocket
and
he
brought
out
a
napkin
when
he
opened
it
there
was
a
sandwich
a
piece
of
cheese
and
a
banana
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
asked
watching
me
anxiously
looks
pretty
good
fine
i
said
hating
to
disappoint
him
although
i
never
eat
sardines
and
bananas
give
me
indigestion
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
a
raw
italian
then
fall
to
he
directed
and
with
a
flourish
he
drew
a
bottle
of
ginger
ale
from
his
pocket
how
this
he
demanded
holding
it
up
cheers
but
does
inebriate
not
a
headache
in
a
barrel
ginger
ale
to
the
gingery
quart
of
ale
is
a
dish
for
a
king
he
said
holding
up
a
glass
shakespeare
miss
minnie
i
was
a
good
bit
more
cheerful
when
i
choked
down
the
sandwich
especially
when
he
assured
me
the
water
was
all
right
a
little
high
as
you
might
say
but
not
poisonous
lord
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
them
staggering
into
my
office
i
saw
enough
i
said
with
a
shiver
that
german
von
inwald
he
went
on
he
the
limit
he
accused
us
of
poisoning
him
for
reasons
of
state
where
are
they
now
my
dear
girl
he
answered
putting
down
his
glass
what
has
been
pounded
into
me
ever
since
i
struck
the
place
the
baths
i
prescribe
all
day
and
dream
all
night
where
are
the
poisonees
now
they
are
steaming
stewing
exuding
in
the
hot
rooms
of
the
bath
department
all
of
them
every
one
of
them
in
the
hold
and
the
hatches
down
he
picked
up
the
pail
and
went
down
the
steps
to
the
spring
after
all
he
said
it
wo
hurt
to
take
out
a
little
of
this
and
pour
it
on
the
ground
it
ought
to
be
good
fertilizer
he
stooped
gentle
spring
ethereal
mildness
come
he
quoted
and
dipped
in
the
pail
just
then
somebody
fell
against
the
door
and
stumbled
into
the
room
it
was
tillie
as
white
as
milk
and
breathing
in
gasps
quick
she
screeched
minnie
quick
what
is
it
i
asked
jumping
up
she
fallen
back
against
the
and
stood
with
her
hand
clutching
her
heart
that
dev
devil
mike
she
panted
he
has
turned
on
the
steam
in
the
men
baths
and
gone
gone
away
with
people
in
the
bath
doctor
barnes
asked
slamming
down
the
pail
tillie
nodded
then
why
in
creation
do
they
get
out
of
the
baths
until
we
can
shut
off
the
steam
i
demanded
grabbing
up
my
shawl
but
tillie
shook
her
head
in
despair
they
ca
she
answered
he
hid
their
clothes
the
next
thing
i
recall
is
running
like
mad
up
the
walk
with
doctor
barnes
beside
me
steadying
me
by
the
arm
i
only
spoke
once
that
i
remember
and
that
was
just
as
we
got
to
the
house
this
settles
it
i
panted
desperately
it
all
over
not
a
bit
of
it
he
said
shoving
me
up
the
steps
and
into
the
hall
the
old
teakettle
is
just
getting
up
a
bit
by
the
gods
and
little
fishes
just
listen
to
it
singing
down
there
the
help
was
gathered
in
a
crowd
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
where
a
cloud
of
steam
was
coming
up
and
down
below
we
could
hear
furious
talking
and
somebody
shouting
mike
mike
in
a
voice
that
was
choked
with
rage
and
steam
doctor
barnes
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
i
followed
there
minnie
amanda
king
yelled
she
knows
all
about
the
place
minnie
you
can
shut
it
off
ca
you
i
try
i
said
and
was
starting
down
when
doctor
barnes
jerked
me
back
you
stay
here
he
said
where
pier
where
carter
down
with
the
engineer

replied
out
of
the
steam
cloud
hello
there
he
called
down
the
staircase
how
the
air
clothes
send
us
some
clothes
it
was
sam
calling
the
rest
was
swallowed
up
in
a
fresh
roaring
as
if
a
had
given
away
that
settled
the
people
below
with
a
burst
of
fury
they
swarmed
up
the
stairs
in
their
bath
sheets
the
bishop
leading
and
just
behind
him
talking
as
no
gentleman
should
talk
under
any
circumstances
senator
biggs
the
rest
followed
their
red
faces
shining
through
the
steam
all
of
them
murderous
holding
their
sheets
around
them
with
one
hand
and
waving
the
other
in
a
frenzy
it
was
awful
the
help
scattered
and
ran
but
i
stood
my
ground
the
sight
of
a
man
in
a
sheet
did
scare
me
and
it
was
no
time
for
weakness
the
steam
was
thicker
than
ever
and
the
hall
was
misty
a
moment
later
the
engineer
came
up
and
after
him
pierce
with
a
towel
over
his
mouth
and
a
in
his
hand
he
was
white
with
rage
he
brushed
past
the
sheets
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
them
and
tore
the
towel
off
his
mouth
who
saw
mike
last
he
shouted
across
to
where
the
pharmacy
clerk
the
elevator
boy
and
some
of
the
had
retreated
to
the
office
and
were
peeping
out
through
the
door
here
moody
who
small
at
any
time
and
who
without
the
padding
on
his
shoulders
and
wrapped
in
a
sheet
with
his
red
face
above
looked
like
a
lighted
cigarette
darted
out
of
the
crowd
and
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
here
he
cried
we
got
a
few
things
to
say
to
you
you
young
take
your
hand
off
my
arm
thundered
pierce
the
storm
broke
with
that
they
crowded
around
pierce
yelling
like
maniacs
and
he
stood
there
and
let
them
wear
themselves
out
the
courage
of
a
man
in
a
den
of
lions
was
nothing
to
it
doctor
barnes
forced
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
stood
there
beside
him
it
was
only
the
steam
and
their
clothes
being
hidden
it
had
started
with
the
scare
at
the
spring
in
the
morning
and
when
they
had
told
him
what
they
thought
about
that
they
went
back
still
further
and
bellowed
about
the
mismanagement
of
the
place
ever
since
he
had
taken
charge
and
the
food
and
the
and
the
new
rules
oh
they
hated
him
all
right
and
they
told
him
so
with
rage
and
heat
dancing
around
him
and
shaking
one
fist
in
his
face
as
i
say
while
they
held
their
sheets
fast
with
the
other
and
i
stood
there
and
watched
my
mind
awhirl
expecting
every
minute
to
hear
that
they
were
all
leaving
or
to
have
some
one
forget
and
shake
both
fists
at
once
and
that
how
it
ended
finally
i
mean
of
course
that
they
said
they
would
all
leave
immediately
and
that
he
ought
to
be
glad
to
have
them
go
quietly
and
not
have
him
jailed
for
malicious
mischief
or
compounding
a
felony
the
whole
thing
was
an
outrage
and
the
three
train
would
leave
the
house
as
empty
as
a
squeezed
lemon
i
wanted
to
go
forward
and
drop
on
my
knees
and
implore
them
to
remember
the
old
doctor
and
the
baths
they
had
when
nothing
went
wrong
and
the
days
when
they
sworn
that
the
spring
kept
them
young
and
well
but
there
was
something
in
pierce
face
that
kept
me
back
at
three
then
he
said
very
well
do
be
a
fool
i
heard
sam
from
the
crowd
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
roared
von
inwald
i
had
noticed
him
before
he
had
his
sheet
on
in
grecian
style
and
it
looked
quite
ornamental
although
a
little
short
have
you
any
apology
to
make
sir
neither
apology
nor
explanation
to
you
pierce
retorted
and
to
the
other
it
is
an
unfortunate
accident
incident
if
you
prefer
he
looked
at
thoburn
who
was
the
only
one
in
a
bath
robe
and
who
was
the
only
cheerful
one
in
the
lot
i
had
refused
a
request
of
the
bath
man
and
he
has
taken
this
form
of
revenge
if
this
gives
me
the
responsibility
i
am
willing
to
take
it
if
you
expect
me
to
ask
you
to
stay
i
not
do
it
i
do
mind
saying
that
i
am
as
tired
of
all
this
as
you
are
as
tired
of
what
demanded
moody
pushing
forward
out
of
the
crowd
sam
was
making
frantic
gestures
to
catch
pierce
eye
but
he
would
not
look
at
him
of
all
this
he
said
of
charging
people
sanatorium
prices
under
a
pretense
of
making
them
well
does
anybody
here
imagine
he
going
to
find
health
by
sitting
around
in
an
overstuffed
leather
chair
with
the
temperature
at
eighty
eating
five
meals
a
day
and
walking
as
far
as
the
mineral
spring
for
exercise
there
was
a
sort
of
angry
snarl
in
the
air
and
sam
threw
up
his
one
free
hand
in
despair
in
fact
pierce
went
on
i
about
decided
on
a
new
order
of
things
for
this
place
anyhow
it
going
to
be
a
real
health
resort
run
for
people
who
want
to
get
well
or
keep
well
people
who
wish
to
be
overfed
overheated
and
coddled
need
not
come
or
stay
the
bishop
spoke
over
the
heads
of
the
others
who
looked
dazed
does
that
mean
he
inquired
mildly
that
guests
must
either
obey
this
new
order
of
things
or
go
away
pierce
looked
at
the
bishop
and
smiled
i
sorry
sir
he
said
but
as
every
one
is
leaving
anyhow
they
fairly
jumped
at
him
then
they
surrounded
him
in
a
howling
mob
and
demanded
how
he
dared
to
turn
them
out
and
what
did
he
mean
by
saying
they
were
overfed
and
they
would
leave
when
they
were
good
and
ready
and
not
before
and
he
could
go
to
blazes
it
was
the
most
scandalous
thing
i
ever
known
of
at
hope
springs
and
in
the
midst
of
it
pierce
stood
cool
and
quiet
waiting
for
a
chance
to
speak
and
when
the
time
came
he
jumped
in
and
told
them
the
truth
about
themselves
and
most
of
it
hurt
he
was
good
and
mad
and
he
stood
there
and
picked
out
the
flabby
ones
and
the
fat
ones
the
whisky
livers
and
the
tobacco
hearts
and
the
banquet
stomachs
and
called
them
out
by
name
when
he
got
through
they
were
standing
in
front
of
him
ashamed
to
look
at
one
another
and
not
knowing
whether
to
fall
on
him
and
tear
him
to
pieces
or
go
and
weep
in
a
corner
because
they
played
such
havoc
with
the
bodies
the
lord
gave
them
if
he
weakened
for
a
minute
they
have
jumped
on
him
but
he
did
he
got
through
and
stood
looking
at
them
in
their
sheets
and
then
he
said
coolly
the
bus
will
be
ready
at
gentlemen
and
turning
on
his
heels
went
into
the
office
and
closed
the
door
they
scattered
to
their
rooms
in
every
stage
of
rage
and
excitement
and
at
last
only
sam
and
i
were
left
staring
at
each
other
damned
young
idiot
he
said
i
wish
to
heavens
you
never
suggested
bringing
him
here
minnie
and
leaving
me
speechless
with
indignation
he
trailed
himself
and
his
sheet
up
the
stairs
chapter
xxii
home
to
roost
i
could
stand
any
more
it
was
all
over
i
rushed
to
my
room
and
threw
myself
on
the
bed
at
i
heard
the
bus
come
to
the
under
my
window
and
then
drive
away
that
was
the
last
straw
i
put
a
pillow
over
my
head
so
nobody
could
hear
me
and
then
and
there
i
had
hysterics
i
knew
i
was
having
them
and
i
was
ashamed
i
have
exploded
if
i
had
and
then
somebody
jerked
the
pillow
away
and
i
looked
up
with
my
eyes
swollen
almost
shut
and
it
was
doctor
barnes
he
had
a
glass
of
water
in
his
hand
and
he
held
it
right
above
me
one
more
yell
he
said
and
it
goes
over
you
i
lay
there
staring
up
at
him
and
then
i
knew
what
a
fright
i
looked
and
although
i
could
speak
yet
i
reached
up
and
felt
for
my
hairpins
that
better
he
said
putting
down
the
glass
another
ten
minutes
of
that
and
you
have
burst
a
blood
vessel
do
worry
i
know
i
have
no
business
here
but
i
anticipated
something
of
this
kind
and
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
i
been
outside
in
the
hall
since
the
first
whoop
it
been
a
good
i
sat
up
and
stared
at
him
i
could
hardly
see
out
of
my
eyes
he
had
his
back
to
the
light
but
i
could
tell
that
he
had
a
cross
of
adhesive
plaster
on
his
cheek
and
that
one
eye
was
almost
shut
he
smiled
when
he
saw
my
expression
it
the
temperament
he
said
it
goes
with
the
hair
i
got
it
too
only
i
apt
to
go
out
and
pick
a
fight
at
such
times
and
a
woman
has
got
that
outlet
as
you
see
i
found
mike
and
my
disfigurement
is
to
mike
as
starlight
to
the
noonday
glare
come
and
take
a
walk
i
shook
my
head
but
he
took
my
arm
and
pulled
me
off
the
bed
you
come
for
a
walk
he
said
i
wait
in
the
hall
until
you
powder
your
nose
you
look
like
a
fire
that
been
put
out
by
a
i
did
want
to
go
but
anything
was
better
than
sitting
in
the
room
moping
i
put
on
my
jacket
and
miss
patty
chinchillas
which
cheered
me
a
little
but
as
we
went
downstairs
the
quiet
of
the
place
sat
on
my
chest
like
a
weight
the
lower
hall
was
empty
a
new
card
headed
rules
hung
on
the
door
into
the
private
office
but
i
did
not
read
it
what
was
the
use
of
rules
without
people
to
disobey
them
moody
had
forgotten
her
crocheting
bag
and
it
hung
on
the
back
of
a
chair
i
had
to
bite
my
lip
to
keep
it
from
trembling
again
the
jenningses
are
still
here
said
the
doctor
the
old
man
is
madder
than
any
hornet
ever
dared
be
and
they
go
in
the
morning
but
the
situation
was
too
much
for
our
german
friend
he
left
with
the
others
well
we
went
out
and
i
took
the
path
i
knew
best
which
was
out
toward
the
there
was
a
soul
in
sight
the
place
looked
lonely
with
the
trees
hung
with
snow
and
arching
over
the
board
walk
at
the
little
bridge
over
the
creek
doctor
barnes
stopped
and
leaning
over
the
rail
took
a
good
look
at
me
when
you
women
go
to
pieces
he
said
you
pretty
near
smash
do
you
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
death
in
your
family
this
was
my
family
i
half
sniveled
but
he
said
you
be
getting
married
and
having
a
home
of
your
own
and
forgetting
all
about
this
he
looked
at
me
with
his
sharp
eyes
there
probably
some
nice
chap
in
the
village
eh
i
shook
my
head
i
had
just
caught
sight
of
the
broken
pieces
of
the
moody
on
the
ice
below
no
nice
young
man
he
remarked
not
the
telegraph
operator
or
the
fellow
who
runs
the
i
forgotten
his
name
look
here
i
turned
on
him
if
you
talking
all
this
nonsense
to
keep
my
mind
off
things
you
need
i
not
he
said
i
asking
for
the
sake
of
my
own
mind
but
not
bother
about
that
now
we
better
start
back
it
was
still
snowing
although
not
so
hard
the
air
had
done
me
some
good
but
the
lump
in
my
throat
seemed
to
have
gone
to
my
chest
the
doctor
helped
me
along
for
the
snow
was
drifting
and
when
he
saw
i
was
past
the
crying
stage
he
went
back
to
what
we
were
both
thinking
about
old
pierce
is
right
he
said
remember
miss
minnie
i
nothing
against
you
or
your
mineral
spring
in
fact
i
strong
for
you
both
but
while
i
out
of
the
ring
now
for
good
i
do
mind
saying
to
you
what
i
said
to
pierce
that
the
only
thing
that
gets
into
training
here
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
a
fellow
pocketbook
we
went
back
to
the
house
and
i
straightened
the
news
stand
amanda
king
having
taken
a
violent
toothache
as
a
result
of
the
excitement
the
jenningses
were
packing
to
go
and
miss
summers
had
got
a
bottle
of
peroxide
and
shut
herself
in
her
room
at
six
tillie
beckoned
to
me
from
the
door
of
the
officers
and
said
she
put
the
basket
in
the
snow
by
the
grape
arbor
i
got
ready
with
a
heavy
heart
to
take
it
out
i
had
forgotten
all
about
their
dinner
for
one
thing
and
i
had
to
carry
bad
news
but
pierce
had
been
there
before
me
i
saw
tracks
in
the
fresh
snow
for
praise
heaven
it
had
snowed
all
that
week
and
our
prints
were
filled
up
almost
as
fast
as
we
made
them
when
i
got
to
the
it
was
in
a
wild
state
of
excitement
dick
with
her
cheeks
flushed
had
gathered
all
her
things
on
the
cot
and
was
rolling
them
up
in
sheets
and
newspapers
but
dick
was
sitting
on
the
box
in
front
of
the
fire
with
his
curly
hair
standing
every
way
he
had
been
roasting
potatoes
and
as
i
opened
the
door
he
picked
one
up
and
poked
at
it
to
see
if
it
was
done
damn
he
said
and
dropped
it
dick
sat
on
the
cot
rolling
up
a
pink
ribbon
and
looked
at
him
if
you
want
to
know
exactly
my
reason
for
insisting
on
moving
i
tell
you
she
said
paying
no
attention
to
me
it
is
your
disposition
he
did
say
anything
but
he
put
his
foot
on
the
potato
and
smashed
it
if
i
had
to
be
shut
in
here
with
you
one
more
day
she
went
on
hate
you
why
the
one
more
day
he
asked
without
looking
up
but
she
did
answer
him
she
was
in
the
worst
kind
of
a
temper
she
threw
the
ribbon
down
and
coming
over
lifted
the
lid
of
my
basket
and
looked
in
ham
again
she
exclaimed
ungratefully
thanks
so
much
for
remembering
us
minnie
i
dare
say
our
dinner
slipped
your
mind
i
wonder
if
it
strikes
you
minnie
dick
said
noticing
me
for
the
first
time
that
if
you
and
sam
had
been
so
confounded
meddling
that
fellow
pierce
would
be
washing
buggies
in
the
village
where
he
belongs
and
i
be
in
one
piece
of
property
that
as
good
as
gone
this
minute
egg
salad
and
cheese
said
dick
i
sick
of
cheese
if
the
kind
of
supper
you
been
serving
but
i
was
in
a
bad
humor
anyhow
and
i
had
enough
i
stood
just
inside
the
door
and
i
told
them
i
done
the
best
i
could
not
for
them
but
because
i
promised
the
old
doctor
and
if
i
made
mistakes
answer
for
them
to
him
if
i
ever
met
him
in
the
next
world
and
in
the
meantime
i
washed
my
hands
of
the
whole
thing
and
they
might
make
out
as
best
they
could
i
was
going
dick
heard
me
through
then
she
came
over
and
put
her
hand
on
mine
where
it
lay
on
the
table
you
perfectly
right
she
said
i
know
how
you
have
tried
and
that
the
fault
is
all
that
wretched
pierce
you
must
mind
carter
minnie
he
been
in
that
sort
of
humor
all
day
he
looked
at
her
with
the
most
miserable
face
i
ever
saw
but
he
say
anything
she
sighed
the
little
wretch
we
all
made
mistakes
she
said
and
not
the
least
was
my
thinking
that
i
well
never
mind
i
dare
say
we
will
manage
somehow
he
got
up
then
his
face
twisted
with
misery
say
it
he
said
you
hate
me
you
shiver
if
i
touch
your
hand
oh
i
not
very
keen
but
i
saw
that
the
remedy
for
that
is
very
simple
she
replied
coolly
you
touch
my
hand
stop
i
snapped
just
stop
before
you
say
something
you
be
sorry
for
of
course
you
hate
each
other
it
beats
me
anyhow
why
two
people
who
get
married
always
want
to
get
away
by
themselves
until
they
so
sick
of
each
other
that
they
do
get
over
it
the
rest
of
their
lives
the
only
sensible
honeymoon
i
ever
heard
of
was
when
one
of
the
chambermaids
here
married
a
farmer
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
harvest
and
he
could
leave
so
she
went
alone
to
see
her
folks
and
she
said
it
beat
having
him
along
all
hollow
she
was
setting
out
the
supper
putting
things
down
with
a
bang
he
did
move
although
he
must
have
been
starving
another
thing
i
advise
i
said
eat
first
and
talk
after
see
things
different
after
you
got
something
in
your
stomach
i
wish
you
would
meddle
minnie
she
snapped
and
having
put
down
her
own
plate
and
knife
and
fork
not
laying
a
place
for
him
she
went
over
and
tried
to
get
one
of
the
potatoes
from
the
fire
well
she
burnt
her
finger
or
pretended
to
and
i
guess
her
solution
was
as
good
as
mine
for
she
began
to
cry
and
when
i
left
he
was
tying
it
up
with
a
bit
of
his
handkerchief
if
she
shivered
when
he
kissed
it
i
did
notice
it
they
were
to
come
up
to
the
house
after
her
father
left
in
the
morning
and
i
was
to
dismiss
all
the
old
help
and
get
new
ones
so
he
could
take
charge
and
let
pierce
go
i
plodded
back
with
my
empty
basket
i
had
only
one
clear
thought
that
i
would
have
any
more
tramping
across
the
golf
links
in
the
snow
i
was
too
tired
really
to
care
that
with
the
regular
winter
boarders
gone
and
eight
weeks
still
until
lent
we
hardly
be
able
to
keep
going
another
fortnight
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
my
room
and
go
to
bed
and
forget
but
as
i
came
near
the
house
i
saw
pierce
come
out
on
the
front
piazza
and
switch
on
the
lights
he
stood
there
looking
out
into
the
snow
and
the
next
minute
i
saw
why
coming
up
the
hill
and
across
the
lawn
was
a
shadowy
line
of
people
black
against
the
white
they
were
not
speaking
and
they
moved
without
noise
over
the
snow
i
thought
for
a
minute
that
my
brain
had
gone
wrong
then
the
first
figure
came
into
the
light
and
it
was
the
bishop
he
stood
at
the
front
of
the
steps
and
looked
up
at
pierce
i
dare
say
he
said
trying
to
look
easy
that
this
is
sooner
than
you
expected
us
pierce
looked
down
at
the
crowd
then
he
smiled
a
growing
smile
that
ended
in
a
grin
on
the
contrary
he
said
i
been
expecting
you
for
an
hour
or
more
the
procession
began
to
move
gloomily
up
the
steps
all
of
them
carried
hand
luggage
and
they
looked
tired
and
sheepish
miss
cobb
stopped
in
front
of
pierce
do
you
mean
to
say
she
demanded
furiously
that
you
knew
the
railroad
was
blocked
with
snow
and
yet
you
let
us
go
on
the
contrary
miss
cobb
he
said
politely
i
remember
distinctly
regretting
that
you
insisted
on
going
besides
there
was
the
sherman
house
senator
briggs
sic
stopped
in
front
of
him
probably
you
also
knew
that
that
was
full
including
the
stables
with
people
from
the
stalled
trains
he
asserted
furiously
two
by
two
they
went
in
and
through
the
hall
stamping
the
snow
off
and
up
to
their
old
rooms
again
leaving
slocum
the
clerk
staring
at
them
as
if
he
could
believe
his
eyes
pierce
and
i
watched
from
the
piazza
through
the
glass
we
saw
doctor
barnes
stop
and
look
and
then
go
and
hang
over
the
news
stand
and
laugh
himself
almost
purple
and
we
saw
thoburn
bringing
up
the
tail
of
the
procession
and
trying
to
look
unconcerned
i
am
not
a
revengeful
woman
but
that
was
one
of
the
happiest
moments
of
my
life
doctor
barnes
turned
suddenly
and
catching
me
by
the
arm
whirled
me
around
and
around
singing
wildly
something
about
noah
and
the
animals
went
in
two
by
two
the
elephant
and
the
kangaroo
he
stopped
as
suddenly
as
he
began
and
walked
me
to
the
door
again
we
got
in
the
ark
he
said
but
i
thinking
this
forty
days
of
snow
is
nearly
over
minnie
i
do
think
much
of
the
dove
and
the
but
we
got
to
keep
them
it
against
the
law
i
quavered
nonsense
he
said
we
got
to
make
want
to
stay
chapter
xxiii
back
to
nature
we
gave
them
a
good
supper
and
pierce
ordered
claret
served
without
extra
charge
by
eight
they
were
all
in
better
humor
and
when
they
gathered
in
the
lobby
miss
summers
gave
an
imitation
of
marie
dressler
doing
the
salome
dance
every
now
and
then
somebody
would
look
out
and
say
it
was
still
snowing
and
with
the
memory
of
the
drifts
and
the
cold
stove
in
the
railroad
station
behind
them
they
gather
closer
around
the
fire
and
insist
that
they
would
go
as
soon
as
the
road
was
cleared
but
with
the
exception
of
von
inwald
not
one
of
them
really
wanted
to
go
as
doctor
barnes
said
over
the
news
stand
each
side
was
bluffing
and
would
call
the
other
and
the
fellow
with
the
most
nerve
would
win
and
oh
my
aunt
he
said
what
a
sweet
disposition
the
von
inwald
has
watch
him
going
up
and
banging
his
head
against
the
wall
everybody
was
charmed
with
the
salome
dance
especially
when
miss
summers
drew
the
cover
off
a
meat
platter
she
been
dancing
around
and
there
was
arabella
sitting
on
her
hind
legs
with
a
card
tied
to
her
neck
and
the
card
said
that
at
eleven
there
would
be
a
clambake
in
the
kitchen
for
all
the
guests
the
clambake
was
my
idea
but
the
dog
of
course
was
miss
julia
i
never
saw
a
woman
so
full
of
ideas
although
it
seems
that
what
should
have
been
on
the
platter
was
the
head
of
somebody
or
other
just
after
the
dance
i
saw
von
inwald
talking
to
miss
patty
he
had
been
ugly
all
evening
and
now
he
looked
like
a
devil
she
stood
facing
him
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
fingers
twisting
her
ruby
ring
i
guessed
that
she
was
about
as
much
surprised
as
anything
else
people
having
a
habit
of
being
pleasant
to
her
most
of
the
time
he
left
her
in
a
rage
and
as
he
went
he
collided
with
arabella
and
kicked
her
miss
patty
went
white
but
miss
summers
was
not
a
bit
put
out
she
simply
picked
up
the
howling
dog
and
confronted
von
inwald
perhaps
you
did
notice
she
said
sweetly
but
you
kicked
my
dog
why
do
you
keep
her
out
of
the
way
he
snarled
and
they
stood
glaring
at
each
other
under
the
circumstances
arabella
miss
julia
said
and
everybody
was
listening
we
can
only
withdraw
von
inwald
invitation
to
the
kitchen
thank
you
i
had
not
intended
to
go
he
said
furiously
and
went
out
into
the
veranda
slamming
the
door
behind
him
jennings
looked
up
from
where
he
was
playing
chess
by
the
fire
and
nodded
at
miss
summers
serves
him
right
for
his
temper
he
said
checkmate
said
the
bishop
jennings
turned
and
glared
at
the
board
then
with
one
sweep
he
threw
all
the
chessmen
on
the
floor
as
tillie
said
later
it
would
be
a
pity
to
spoil
two
houses
with
von
inwald
and
jennings
if
they
were
in
the
same
family
they
could
work
it
off
on
each
other
miss
patty
came
down
to
the
news
stand
and
pretended
to
hunt
for
a
magazine
i
reached
over
and
stroked
her
hand
do
take
it
too
hard
dearie
i
said
he
put
out
and
maybe
he
is
well
men
are
like
babies
if
their
stomachs
are
all
right
and
have
plenty
in
them
they
pleasant
enough
it
been
my
experience
that
your
cranky
man
a
sick
man
i
do
think
he
is
sick
minnie
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
i
i
think
he
is
just
dev
devilish
well
i
thought
that
too
so
i
just
stroked
her
hand
and
after
a
minute
she
got
her
color
again
it
is
hard
for
him
she
said
he
thinks
this
is
all
vulgar
and
american
and
oh
minnie
i
want
to
get
away
and
yet
what
shall
i
do
without
you
to
keep
me
sensible
you
be
a
long
ways
off
soon
i
said
touching
the
ring
under
my
hand
i
wish
you
could
come
with
me
she
said
but
i
shook
my
head
here
is
one
dog
that
is
going
to
sit
under
any
rich
man
table
and
howl
for
crumbs
i
answered
if
he
kicked
me
i
bite
him
at
eleven
we
had
the
clambake
with
beer
in
the
kitchen
and
von
inwald
came
after
all
they
were
really
very
cheerful
all
of
them
doctor
barnes
insisted
that
senator
biggs
must
not
fast
any
longer
and
he
ate
by
my
count
three
dozen
clams
at
the
end
when
everybody
was
happy
and
everything
forgiven
pierce
got
up
and
made
a
speech
he
said
he
was
sorry
for
what
had
happened
that
day
but
that
much
he
had
said
he
still
maintained
that
to
pretend
to
make
people
well
in
the
way
most
sanatoriums
did
it
was
sheer
folly
and
he
felt
his
responsibility
too
keenly
to
countenance
a
system
that
was
clearly
wrong
and
that
the
best
modern
thought
considered
obsolete
miss
cobb
sat
up
at
that
she
is
always
talking
about
the
best
modern
thought
he
said
that
perfect
health
clear
skins
bright
eyes
he
looked
at
the
women
and
except
for
miss
patty
there
was
an
honest
complexion
or
a
bright
eye
in
the
lot
keen
appetites
and
joy
of
living
all
depended
on
rational
and
simple
living
hear
hear
said
the
men
the
nearer
we
live
to
nature
the
better
said
senator
biggs
oracularly
back
to
nature
shouted
moody
through
a
clam
exactly
pierce
said
smiling
moody
looked
alarmed
you
do
mean
doing
without
clothes
and
all
that
she
protested
surely
miss
summers
said
holding
up
her
beer
glass
a
toast
everybody
back
to
nature
sans
rats
sans
rouge
sans
stays
sans
everything
i
need
to
wear
a
tag
with
my
name
on
it
nobody
will
recognize
me
pierce
got
up
again
at
the
head
of
the
long
kitchen
table
and
said
he
merely
meant
rational
living
more
air
more
exercise
simpler
food
and
better
hours
it
was
being
done
now
in
a
thousand
farms
and
succeeding
men
went
back
to
their
business
and
women
grew
more
beautiful
at
that
what
with
the
reaction
from
sitting
in
the
cold
station
and
the
beer
and
everything
they
all
grew
enthusiastic
doctor
barnes
made
a
speech
telling
that
he
used
to
be
puny
and
weak
and
how
he
went
into
training
and
became
a
pugilist
and
how
he
fought
the
tennessee
something
or
other
the
men
nodded
as
if
they
knew
and
licked
him
in
forty
seconds
or
forty
rounds
i
not
sure
which
the
men
were
standing
on
their
chairs
cheering
for
him
and
even
jennings
who
been
sitting
and
not
saying
much
said
he
thought
probably
there
was
something
in
it
they
ended
by
agreeing
to
try
it
out
for
a
week
beginning
with
the
morning
when
everybody
was
to
be
down
for
breakfast
by
thoburn
got
up
and
made
a
speech
protesting
that
they
did
know
what
they
were
letting
themselves
in
for
and
ended
up
by
demanding
to
know
if
he
was
expected
to
breakfast
at
yes
or
earlier
pierce
said
pleasantly
i
suppose
you
could
have
something
at
seven
and
suppose
i
refuse
he
retorted
disagreeably
but
everybody
turned
on
him
and
said
if
they
could
do
it
he
could
and
he
sat
down
again
then
somebody
suggested
that
if
they
were
to
get
up
they
have
to
go
to
bed
and
the
party
broke
up
doctor
barnes
helped
me
gather
up
the
clam
shells
and
the
plates
it
a
risky
business
he
said
does
mean
anything
they
carried
away
by
the
reaction
and
the
desire
for
something
new
the
next
week
will
tell
the
tale
if
we
could
only
get
rid
of
mr
thoburn
i
exclaimed
doctor
barnes
chuckled
we
may
not
get
rid
of
him
he
said
but
i
can
promise
him
the
most
interesting
week
of
his
life
he
be
too
busy
for
mischief
i
going
to
take
six
inches
off
his
waist
line
well
in
a
or
so
i
had
cleared
away
and
i
went
out
to
the
lobby
to
lock
up
the
news
stand
just
as
i
opened
the
door
from
the
back
hall
however
i
heard
two
people
talking
it
was
miss
pat
and
pierce
she
was
on
the
stairs
and
he
in
the
hall
below
looking
up
i
do
want
to
stay
she
was
saying
but
do
you
see
he
argued
if
you
go
the
others
will
ca
you
try
it
for
a
week
i
quite
understand
your
motive
she
said
looking
down
at
him
more
pleasantly
than
she
ever
done
and
it
very
good
of
you
and
all
that
but
if
you
only
left
things
as
they
were
and
let
us
all
go
and
other
people
come
that
just
it
he
said
i
told
it
the
bad
season
and
nobody
else
would
come
until
lent
and
anyhow
it
not
business
to
let
a
lot
of
people
go
away
mad
it
gives
the
place
a
black
eye
dear
me
she
said
how
businesslike
you
are
growing
he
went
over
close
to
the
stairs
and
dropped
his
voice
if
you
want
the
bitter
truth
he
went
on
trying
to
smile
i
put
myself
on
trial
and
been
convicted
of
being
a
fool
and
a
failure
failed
regularly
and
with
precision
at
everything
i
have
tried
been
going
around
so
long
trying
to
find
a
place
that
i
fit
into
that
i
scarred
as
with
many
battles
and
now
i
on
probation
for
the
last
time
if
this
does
go
i
i
what
she
asked
leaning
down
to
him
you
not
oh
no
he
said
nothing
dramatic
of
course
i
could
go
around
the
country
in
a
buggy
selling
she
drew
herself
back
as
if
she
resented
his
refusal
of
her
sympathy
or
open
a
saloon
in
the
philippines
he
finished
mockingly
there
a
living
in
that
you
are
impossible
she
said
and
turned
away
oh
i
have
any
excuse
to
make
for
him
i
think
he
was
just
hungry
for
her
sympathy
and
her
respect
knowing
nothing
else
was
coming
to
him
but
the
minute
they
grew
a
bit
friendly
he
seemed
to
remember
the
prince
and
that
according
to
his
idea
of
it
she
was
selling
herself
and
he
would
draw
off
and
look
at
her
in
a
mocking
unhappy
way
that
made
me
want
to
slap
him
he
watched
her
up
the
stairs
and
then
turned
and
walked
to
the
fire
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
head
down
i
closed
the
news
stand
and
he
came
over
just
as
i
was
hanging
up
the
key
for
amanda
king
in
the
morning
he
reached
up
and
took
the
key
off
its
nail
i
keep
that
he
said
it
no
tobacco
after
this
minnie
you
ca
keep
them
here
then
i
retorted
they
got
to
smoke
it
the
only
work
they
do
we
see
he
said
quietly
and
oh
yes
minnie
now
that
we
shall
not
be
using
the
mineral
spring
not
use
the
mineral
spring
i
repeated
stupefied
certainly
not
he
said
this
is
a
drugless
sanatorium
minnie
from
now
on
that
part
of
the
theory
no
drugs
well
i
tell
you
one
thing
i
snapped
theory
or
no
theory
got
to
have
drugs
no
theory

he
put
his
elbow
on
the
stand
and
smiled
at
me
listen
minnie
he
said
if
you
had
been
wasting
your
abilities
in
the
mineral
spring
i
be
sorry
to
close
it
but
there
will
be
plenty
for
you
to
do
do
you
know
that
the
day
of
the
in
the
and
the
counter
is
over
got
sanatoriums
now
instead
of
family
doctors
in
other
words
we
put
in
good
sanitation
systems
and
do
need
the
plumber
and
his
repair
kit
the
pharmacy
i
said
between
my
teeth
closed
also
no
medicine
minnie
that
our
slogan
this
is
the
day
of
prophylaxis
the
doctors
have
taken
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
are
giving
fewer
drugs
christian
science
has
abolished
drugs
and
established
the
healer
we
simply
abolish
the
healer
if
we
not
going
to
use
the
we
might
have
saved
the
expense
of
the
new
roof
in
the
fall
i
said
bitterly
not
at
all
for
two
hours
or
so
a
day
the
will
be
a
windows
wide
open
and
god
good
air
penetrating
to
fastnesses
it
never
knew
before
the
spring
will
freeze
exactly
my
only
regret
is
that
it
is
too
small
to
skate
on
but
they
have
the
ice
pond
when
i
see
moody
skating
on
the
ice
pond
i
said
sarcastically
i
see
moody
dead
with
the
shock
on
the
bank
not
at
all
he
replied
calmly
you
see
her
skating
too
and
with
that
he
went
to
bed
chapter
xxiv
like
ducks
to
water
they
took
to
it
like
ducks
take
to
water
not
of
course
that
they
did
kick
about
making
their
own
beds
and
having
military
discipline
generally
they
complained
a
lot
but
when
after
three
days
went
by
with
the
railroad
running
as
much
on
schedule
as
it
ever
does
they
were
all
still
there
and
jennings
had
limped
out
and
spent
a
at
the
with
his
gouty
foot
on
a
cushion
i
saw
it
was
a
success
i
ought
to
have
been
glad
i
was
although
when
dicky
found
they
were
all
staying
and
that
she
might
have
to
live
in
the
the
rest
of
the
winter
there
was
an
awful
scene
i
was
glad
too
every
time
i
could
see
thoburn
gloomy
face
or
hear
the
things
he
said
when
his
name
went
up
for
the
military
walk
oh
yes
we
had
a
blackboard
in
the
hall
and
every
morning
each
guest
looked
to
see
if
it
was
day
or
day
at
first
instead
of
it
was
day
but
they
soon
had
the
snow
off
all
the
paths
as
i
say
i
was
glad
it
looked
as
if
the
new
idea
was
a
success
although
as
doctor
barnes
said
nobody
could
really
tell
until
new
people
began
to
come
that
was
the
real
test
they
had
turned
the
baths
into
a
gymnasium
and
they
had
beginners
classes
and
advanced
classes
and
a
prize
offered
on
the
blackboard
of
a
cigar
for
the
man
who
made
the
most
muscular
improvement
in
a
week
the
bishop
won
it
the
first
week
being
the
only
one
who
could
lie
on
his
back
and
raise
himself
to
a
sitting
position
without
helping
himself
with
his
hands
as
moody
said
it
would
be
easy
enough
if
somebody
only
sat
on
one
feet
to
hold
them
down
but
i
must
say
i
never
got
over
the
shock
of
seeing
the
drifted
with
snow
all
the
windows
wide
open
the
spring
frozen
hard
and
people
sitting
there
during
the
rest
hour
in
furs
and
steamer
rugs
trying
to
play
cards
with
mittens
on
their
hands
not
the
cards
of
course
and
not
wrangling
i
was
lonesome
for
it
i
had
much
to
do
except
from
two
to
four
to
be
at
the
and
to
count
for
the
exercise
oh
yes
we
had
that
too
i
rang
a
bell
every
and
everybody
got
up
and
i
counted
slowly
one
and
they
breathed
in
through
their
noses
and
two
and
they
exhaled
quickly
through
their
mouths
i
guess
most
of
them
used
more
of
their
lungs
than
they
ever
knew
they
had
well
everybody
looked
better
and
felt
better
although
they
all
acknowledge
it
miss
cobb
suffered
most
not
having
the
fire
log
to
curl
her
hair
with
but
as
she
said
herself
between
gymnasium
and
military
walks
and
the
silence
hour
and
eating
which
took
a
long
time
everybody
being
hungry
and
going
to
bed
at
nine
she
did
see
how
she
could
have
worried
with
it
anyhow
the
fat
ones
of
course
objected
to
an
apple
and
a
cup
of
hot
water
for
breakfast
but
except
thoburn
they
all
realized
it
was
for
the
best
he
was
there
for
his
health
he
said
having
never
had
a
sick
day
in
his
life
but
when
he
saw
it
was
apple
and
hot
water
or
leave
he
did
like
adam
he
took
the
apple
the
strange
thing
of
all
was
the
way
they
began
to
look
up
to
pierce
he
was
very
strict
if
he
made
a
rule
it
was
obey
or
leave
as
they
knew
after
moody
refused
to
take
the
military
walk
and
was
presented
with
his
bill
and
a
railroad
schedule
within
an
hour
he
had
to
take
the
military
walk
with
doctor
barnes
that
afternoon
alone
they
had
to
respect
a
man
who
could
do
all
the
things
in
the
gymnasium
that
they
could
and
come
in
from
a
ten
or
tramp
through
the
snow
and
take
a
cold
plunge
and
a
swim
to
rest
himself
it
was
on
monday
that
we
really
got
things
started
and
on
monday
afternoon
miss
summers
came
out
to
the
in
a
towering
rage
where
mr
pierce
she
demanded
i
guess
you
can
see
he
is
here
i
said
just
wait
until
i
see
him
she
announced
do
you
know
that
i
am
down
on
the
blackboard
for
the
military
walk
why
not
she
turned
and
glared
at
me
why
not
she
repeated
why
the
audacity
of
the
wretch
he
brings
me
out
into
the
country
in
winter
to
play
in
his
atrocious
play
strands
me
and
then
tells
me
to
walk
twenty
miles
a
day
and
smile
over
it
she
came
over
to
me
and
shook
my
arm
not
only
that
she
said
but
he
has
cut
out
my
cigarettes
and
put
arabella
on
dog
biscuit
arabella
who
can
hardly
eat
a
chicken
wing
well
there
something
to
be
thankful
for
i
said
he
did
put
you
on
dog
biscuit
she
laughed
then
with
one
of
her
quick
changes
of
humor
the
worst
of
it
is
she
said
in
a
confidential
whisper
i
do
it
i
feel
it
i
guess
if
the
truth
were
known
i
some
older
than
he
is
but
i
afraid
of
him
minnie
little
judy
is
ready
to
crawl
around
and
speak
for
a
cracker
or
a
kind
word
oh
i
not
in
love
with
him
but
he
got
the
courage
to
say
what
he
means
and
do
what
he
says
she
went
to
the
door
and
looked
back
smiling
i
off
for
the
she
called
back
and
i
promised
to
chop
two
inches
off
my
heels
as
i
say
they
took
to
it
like
ducks
to
water
except
two
of
them
von
inwald
and
thoburn
von
inwald
stayed
on
i
hardly
know
why
but
i
guess
it
was
because
jennings
still
had
done
anything
final
about
settlements
and
with
the
newspapers
marrying
him
every
day
it
very
comfortable
next
to
him
thoburn
was
the
unhappiest
mortal
i
have
ever
seen
he
would
leave
and
with
doctor
barnes
carrying
out
his
threat
to
take
six
inches
off
his
waist
he
stopped
measuring
with
a
tape
line
and
took
to
measuring
himself
i
came
across
him
on
wednesday
the
third
day
straggling
home
from
the
military
walk
he
and
von
inwald
limped
across
the
and
collapsed
on
the
steps
of
the
while
the
others
went
on
to
the
sanatorium
i
had
been
brushing
the
porch
and
i
leaned
on
my
broom
and
looked
at
them
you
both
looking
a
lot
better
i
said
not
so
well
not
so
how
do
you
like
it
by
this
time
fine
answered
thoburn
would
stay
if
i
did
like
it
would
you
but
i
tell
you
this
minnie
he
said
changing
his
position
with
a
groan
to
look
up
at
me
somebody
ought
to
warn
that
young
man
human
nature
can
stand
a
lot
but
it
ca
stand
everything
he
overdoing
it
they
like
it
i
said
they
think
they
do
he
retorted
mark
my
words
minnie
if
he
adds
another
mile
to
the
walk
there
will
be
a
mutiny
kingdoms
may
be
lost
by
an
extra
blister
on
a
heel
von
inwald
had
been
sitting
with
his
feet
straight
out
scowling
but
now
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
coolly
all
that
keeps
me
here
he
said
is
minnie
lovely
hair
it
takes
me
mentally
back
home
minnie
to
a
lovely
lady
may
i
have
a
bit
of
it
to
keep
by
me
you
may
not
i
retorted
angrily
oh
the
lovely
lady
but
never
mind
that
for
the
sake
of
my
love
for
you
minnie
find
me
a
cigarette
like
a
good
girl
i
am
desolate
there
no
tobacco
on
the
place
i
said
firmly
and
went
on
with
my
sweeping
when
i
was
a
boy
thoburn
remarked
looking
out
thoughtfully
over
the
snow
we
made
a
sort
of
cigarette
out
of
you
happen
to
have
any
about
do
you
minnie
no
i
said
shortly
if
you
take
my
advice
thoburn
you
go
back
to
town
you
can
get
all
the
tobacco
you
want
there
and
wasting
your
time
here
i
leaned
on
my
broom
and
looked
down
at
him
but
he
was
stretching
out
his
foot
and
painfully
working
his
ankle
up
and
down
am
i
he
asked
looking
at
his
foot
well
do
count
on
it
too
much
minnie
you
always
inspire
me
and
sitting
here
i
just
thought
of
something
he
got
up
and
hobbled
off
the
porch
followed
by
von
inwald
i
saw
him
say
something
to
von
inwald
who
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
then
i
saw
them
stop
and
shake
hands
and
go
on
again
in
deep
conversation
i
felt
uneasy
doctor
barnes
came
out
that
afternoon
and
watched
me
while
i
closed
the
windows
he
had
a
package
in
his
hand
he
sat
on
the
railing
of
the
spring
and
looked
at
me
you
not
warmly
enough
dressed
for
this
kind
of
thing
he
remarked
where
that
gray
rabbits
fur
or
whatever
it
is
if
you
mean
my
chinchillas
i
said
they
in
their
box
chinchillas
are
as
delicate
as
babies
and
not
near
so
plentiful
i
warm
enough
you
look
it
he
reached
over
and
caught
one
of
my
hands
look
at
that
blue
nails
it
about
four
degrees
above
zero
here
and
while
the
rest
are
wrapped
in
furs
and
steamer
rugs
with
hotwater
bottles
at
their
feet
you
got
on
a
shawl
i
bet
you
two
dollars
you
got
on
any
er
winter
flannels
i
never
bet
i
retorted
and
went
on
folding
up
the
steamer
rugs
i
like
to
help
he
said
but
you
so
darned
capable
miss
minnie
you
might
see
if
you
can
get
the
empty
i
said
full
of
water
it
would
work
and
moody
thought
it
was
frozen
he
been
carrying
out
boiling
water
all
afternoon
if
it
stays
in
there
and
freezes
the
thing
will
explode
he
was
listening
he
been
fussing
with
his
package
and
now
he
opened
it
and
handed
it
to
me
in
the
paper
it
a
sweater
he
said
not
looking
at
me
i
bought
it
for
myself
and
it
was
too
small
confound
it
minnie
i
wish
i
could
lie
i
bought
them
for
you
there
the
whole
business
sweater
cap
leggings
and
mittens
go
on
throw
them
at
me
but
i
did
i
looked
at
them
all
white
and
soft
and
it
came
over
me
suddenly
how
kind
people
had
been
lately
and
how
much
i
been
getting
the
old
doctor
waistcoat
buttons
and
miss
pat
furs
and
now
this
i
just
buried
my
face
in
them
and
cried
doctor
barnes
stood
by
and
said
nothing
some
men
would
have
understood
but
he
did
after
a
minute
or
so
he
came
over
and
pulled
the
sweater
out
from
the
bundle
i
glad
you
like
he
said
but
as
i
bought
them
at
hubbard
in
finleyville
and
as
the
old
liar
guaranteed
they
would
shrink
better
not
cry
on
well
i
put
them
on
and
i
was
warmer
and
happier
than
i
had
been
for
some
time
but
that
night
when
i
went
out
to
the
with
the
supper
basket
i
found
both
the
honeymooners
in
a
wild
state
of
excitement
they
said
that
about
five
thoburn
had
gone
out
to
the
and
walked
all
around
it
finally
he
had
stopped
at
one
of
the
windows
of
the
other
room
had
worked
at
it
with
his
penknife
and
got
it
open
and
crawled
through
they
sat
paralyzed
with
fright
and
heard
him
moving
around
the
other
room
and
he
even
tried
their
door
but
it
had
been
locked
they
had
the
slightest
idea
what
he
was
doing
but
after
perhaps
ten
minutes
he
went
away
going
out
the
door
this
time
and
taking
the
key
with
him
dick
had
gone
in
when
he
was
safely
gone
but
he
could
see
nothing
unusual
except
that
the
door
of
the
cupboard
in
the
corner
was
standing
open
and
there
was
a
folding
foot
rule
in
it
that
day
the
bar
was
closed
for
good
and
there
was
a
good
bit
of
fussing
to
add
to
the
trouble
that
evening
at
dinner
the
pastries
were
cut
off
and
at
eight
a
delegation
headed
by
senator
biggs
visited
pierce
in
the
office
and
demanded
pastry
put
back
on
the
menu
and
the
stewed
fruit
taken
off
but
pierce
was
firm
and
they
came
out
pretty
well
subdued
it
was
that
night
i
think
that
candles
were
put
in
the
bedrooms
and
all
the
electric
lights
were
turned
off
at
at
ten
i
took
my
candle
and
went
to
pierce
door
i
did
think
they
stand
much
more
and
i
wanted
to
tell
him
so
nobody
answered
and
i
opened
the
door
he
was
asleep
face
down
on
the
in
front
of
the
fire
his
candle
was
lighted
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
near
it
lay
a
newspaper
cutting
crumpled
in
a
ball
i
picked
it
up
it
was
a
list
of
the
bridal
party
for
miss
wedding
i
dropped
it
where
i
found
it
and
went
out
and
knocked
again
loudly
he
wakened
after
a
minute
and
came
to
the
door
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
oh
it
you
minnie
come
in
i
went
in
and
put
my
candle
on
the
table
i
got
to
talk
to
you
i
said
i
do
mind
admitting
things
have
been
going
pretty
well
but
they
wo
stand
for
the
candles
you
mark
my
words
if
they
stand
for
the
bar
being
closed
why
not
the
candles
he
demanded
well
i
said
they
ca
have
electric
light
sent
up
in
boxes
and
labeled
but
they
can
get
liquor
that
way
he
whistled
and
then
he
laughed
then
we
not
have
any
books
he
said
i
guess
they
can
manage
only
books
were
woman
looks
and
then
he
saw
the
ball
of
paper
on
the
floor
and
his
expression
changed
he
walked
over
and
picked
it
up
smoothing
it
out
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
after
a
minute
he
looked
up
at
me
i
have
been
to
the
they
are
all
right
they
nervous
with
everybody
walking
these
days
they
dare
venture
a
nose
out
of
doors
he
was
still
holding
the
clipping
and
miss
jennings
he
said
she
i
think
she
looks
better
her
father
in
a
better
humor
for
one
thing
says
abraham
lincoln
split
logs
and
that
it
beats
massage
i
had
been
standing
in
the
doorway
but
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
drew
me
into
the
room
i
wish
you
sit
down
for
about
ten
minutes
minnie
he
said
i
guess
every
fellow
has
a
time
when
he
got
to
tell
his
troubles
to
some
good
woman
not
but
that
you
know
mine
already
you
as
shrewd
as
you
are
kind
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
for
all
i
had
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
sanatorium
i
never
forgot
that
i
was
only
the
girl
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
easy
chair
with
the
candle
behind
him
on
the
table
and
his
arms
above
his
head
it
like
this
minnie
he
said
jennings
likes
the
new
order
of
things
and
he
going
to
stay
i
nodded
and
i
like
it
here
i
want
to
stay
it
the
one
thing
i
found
that
i
think
i
can
do
it
is
what
i
dreamed
of
but
it
worth
while
to
anchor
the
derelicts
of
humanity
in
a
sort
of
repair
dock
here
and
scrape
the
barnacles
off
their
dispositions
and
send
them
out
shipshape
again
surely
that
something
and
i
can
do
it
i
nodded
again
but
if
the
jenningses
stay
he
looked
at
me
minnie
in
name
what
am
i
going
to
do
if
she
stays
i
do
know
pierce
i
said
i
could
sleep
last
night
for
thinking
about
it
he
smoothed
out
the
paper
and
looked
at
it
again
but
i
think
he
scarcely
saw
it
the
situation
is
humorous
he
said
only
my
sense
of
humor
seems
to
have
died
she
does
know
i
exist
except
to
invent
new
and
troublesome
regulations
for
her
annoyance
she
is
very
sweet
when
she
meets
me
but
only
because
i
am
helping
her
to
have
her
own
way
and
i
my
god
minnie
i
sit
in
the
office
and
listen
for
her
step
outside
he
moved
a
little
and
held
out
the
paper
in
the
will
please
americans
to
know
he
read
with
the
exception
of
the
venetian
lace
robe
sent
by
the
bridegroom
mother
all
of
miss
patricia
jennings
elaborate
trousseau
is
being
made
in
america
oskar
and
his
suite
according
to
present
arrangements
will
sail
from
naples
early
in
march
and
the
wedding
date
although
not
yet
definitely
fixed
will
probably
be
the
first
week
in
april
the
wedding
party
will
include
he
stopped
there
and
looked
at
me
trying
to
smile
i
knew
it
all
before
he
said
but
there
something
inevitable
about
print
i
guess
i
had
realized
it
he
had
the
same
look
of
wretchedness
he
had
the
first
night
i
saw
him
a
hungry
look
and
i
could
help
it
i
went
over
to
him
and
patted
him
on
the
head
like
a
little
boy
i
was
only
the
girl
but
i
was
older
than
he
was
and
he
needed
somebody
to
comfort
him
i
ca
think
of
anything
to
say
that
will
help
any
i
said
unless
it
what
you
wrote
yourself
on
the
blackboard
down
in
the
hall
busy
and
you
keep
happy
he
reached
up
for
my
hand
and
rough
and
red
as
it
was
having
been
in
the
spring
for
so
many
years
he
kissed
it
good
for
you
minnie
he
said
you
rational
and
for
a
day
or
so
i
have
been
that
right
keep
busy
i
do
it
he
got
up
and
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
good
old
pal
when
you
see
me
going
around
as
if
all
the
devils
of
hell
were
tormenting
me
just
come
up
and
say
that
to
me
will
you
i
promised
and
he
opened
the
door
candle
in
hand
and
smiling
i
a
thousand
per
cent
better
already
he
said
i
just
needed
to
tell
somebody
i
think
i
dare
say
i
made
a
lot
more
fuss
than
it
really
deserves
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
a
girl
came
out
of
one
room
and
carrying
a
candle
went
across
to
another
it
was
miss
patty
going
to
bid
her
father
good
night
when
i
left
he
was
still
staring
down
the
hall
after
her
his
candle
dripping
wax
on
the
floor
and
his
face
white
i
guess
he
had
overstated
his
case
chapter
xxv
the
first
fruits
by
friday
of
that
week
you
would
hardly
have
known
any
of
them
the
fat
ones
were
thinner
and
the
thin
ones
fatter
and
miss
julia
summers
could
put
her
whole
hand
inside
her
belt
and
they
were
pleasant
they
sit
down
to
a
supper
of
ham
and
eggs
and
apple
sauce
and
yell
for
more
apple
sauce
and
every
evening
in
the
billiard
room
they
got
up
two
weighing
pools
one
for
the
ones
who
wanted
to
reduce
and
one
for
the
people
who
wanted
to
gain
everybody
put
in
a
dollar
and
at
gymnasium
hour
the
next
morning
the
ones
gained
or
lost
the
most
won
the
pool
thoburn
won
the
losing
pool
on
thursday
and
friday
he
did
want
to
lose
weight
but
he
was
compelled
to
under
the
circumstances
and
i
think
worry
helped
him
to
it
they
fussed
some
still
about
sleeping
with
the
windows
open
especially
the
men
however
the
bishop
who
had
been
bald
for
thirty
years
was
getting
a
fine
down
all
over
the
top
of
his
head
and
this
encouraged
the
rest
the
bishop
says
it
is
nature
instinct
to
protect
itself
from
cold
all
animals
have
fur
and
heavier
fur
in
winter
and
he
believed
that
it
was
the
ultimate
cure
for
baldness
men
lose
their
hair
on
top
he
said
because
they
wear
hats
and
so
do
need
it
but
let
the
top
of
the
head
need
protection
and
lo
hair
comes
there
although
as
thoburn
said
his
nose
was
always
cold
in
winter
and
nature
never
did
anything
for
it
von
inwald
was
still
there
and
not
troubling
himself
to
be
agreeable
to
any
but
the
jennings
family
he
and
pierce
carefully
avoided
each
other
but
i
knew
well
enough
that
only
policy
kept
them
apart
both
of
them
you
see
were
working
for
something
miss
cobb
came
to
the
early
friday
morning
and
from
the
way
she
came
in
and
shut
the
door
i
knew
she
had
something
on
her
mind
she
walked
over
to
where
i
was
polishing
the
brass
railing
around
the
spring
it
had
been
the
habit
of
years
and
not
easy
to
break
and
stood
looking
at
me
and
breathing
hard
minnie
she
exclaimed
i
have
found
the
thief
lord
have
mercy
i
said
and
dropped
the
brass
polish
i
have
found
the
thief
she
repeated
firmly
minnie
our
sins
always
find
us
out
i
guess
they
do
i
said
shakily
and
sat
down
on
the
steps
to
the
spring
oh
miss
cobb
if
only
he
would
use
a
little
bit
of
sense
he
she
said
he
nothing
it
that
summers
woman
i
talking
about
minnie
i
knew
that
woman
was
what
she
ought
to
be
the
minute
i
set
eyes
on
her
the
summers
woman
i
repeated
miss
cobb
leaned
over
the
railing
and
shook
a
finger
in
my
face
the
summers
woman
she
said
one
of
the
chambermaids
found
my
my
protectors
hanging
in
the
creature
closet
i
could
speak
there
had
been
so
much
happening
that
i
clean
forgotten
miss
cobb
and
her
woolen
tights
and
now
to
have
them
come
back
like
this
and
hang
themselves
around
my
neck
so
to
speak
it
was
too
much
per
perhaps
they
hers
i
said
weakly
after
a
minute
stuff
and
nonsense
declared
miss
cobb
do
you
think
i
know
my
own
with
in
white
cotton
on
the
band
and
my
own
darning
in
the
knee
where
i
slipped
on
the
ice
and
more
than
that
minnie
where
those
tights
are
my
letters
are
i
glanced
at
the
pantry
where
her
letters
were
hidden
on
the
upper
shelf
the
door
was
closed
but
but
what
would
she
want
with
the
letters
i
asked
with
my
teeth
fairly
hitting
together
miss
cobb
pushed
her
forefinger
into
my
shoulder
to
blackmail
me
she
said
in
a
tragic
voice
or
perhaps
to
publish
i
often
thought
of
that
myself
they
so
beautiful
letters
from
a
life
insurance
agent
to
his
interesting
you
know
and
alliterative
as
for
that
woman
what
woman
said
miss
summers
voice
from
behind
us
we
jumped
and
turned
i
always
save
myself
trouble
so
if
by
any
chance
you
are
discussing
me
as
it
happens
miss
cobb
said
glaring
at
her
i
was
discussing
you
fine
said
miss
julia
i
love
to
talk
about
myself
i
doubt
if
it
an
edifying
subject
miss
cobb
snapped
miss
julia
looked
at
her
and
smiled
perhaps
not
she
said
but
interesting
do
put
yourself
out
to
be
friendly
to
me
miss
cobb
if
you
do
feel
like
it
are
you
going
to
return
my
letters
miss
cobb
demanded
your
letters
my
letters
that
you
took
out
of
my
room
look
here
miss
julia
said
still
in
a
good
humor
do
you
suppose
i
got
letters
of
my
own
without
bothering
with
another
woman
perhaps
miss
cobb
replied
in
triumph
perhaps
you
will
say
that
you
do
know
anything
of
my
of
my
black
woolen
protectors
never
heard
of
them
said
miss
summers
what
are
they
and
then
she
caught
my
eye
and
i
guess
i
looked
stricken
oh
she
said
miss
cobb
was
robbed
the
other
night
i
explained
as
quietly
as
i
could
somebody
went
into
her
room
and
took
a
bundle
of
letters
letters
miss
summers
straightened
and
looked
at
me
and
my
woolen
tights
said
miss
cobb
indignantly
with
all
this
cold
weather
and
military
walks
and
having
to
sit
two
hours
a
day
by
an
open
window
and
i
tell
you
this
miss
summers
your
dog
got
in
my
room
that
night
and
while
i
have
no
suspicions
the
chambermaid
found
my
er
missing
garment
this
morning
in
your
closet
i
do
believe
miss
julia
said
looking
hard
at
me
that
arabella
would
steal
anything
so
er
grotesque
do
you
mean
to
say
she
added
slowly
that
nothing
was
taken
from
that
room
but
the
lingerie
and
a
bundle
of
letters
exactly
said
miss
cobb
and
i
thank
you
for
the
letters
the
letters
miss
julia
retorted
i
never
been
in
your
room
i
have
got
the
letters
i
never
seen
them
then
a
light
dawned
in
her
face
i
oh
it
the
funniest
ever
and
with
that
she
threw
her
head
back
and
laughed
until
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
she
held
her
side
screaming
she
gasped
it
screaming
but
oh
minnie
to
have
seen
your
face
miss
cobb
swept
to
the
door
and
turned
in
a
fury
i
do
not
think
it
is
funny
she
stormed
and
i
shall
report
to
carter
at
once
what
i
have
discovered
she
banged
out
and
miss
julia
put
her
head
on
a
and
writhed
with
joy
to
have
seen
your
face
minnie
she
panted
wiping
her
eyes
to
have
thought
you
had
dick
carter
letters
that
i
keep
rolled
in
asbestos
and
then
to
have
opened
them
and
found
they
were
to
miss
cobb
be
as
happy
as
you
like
i
snapped
but
you
are
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
i
do
know
anything
about
any
letters
and
as
far
as
that
goes
do
you
think
i
lived
here
fourteen
years
to
get
into
the
wrong
room
at
night
if
i
wanted
to
get
into
your
room
i
have
found
your
room
not
miss
cobb
she
sat
up
and
pulled
her
hat
straight
looking
me
right
in
the
eye
if
you
recall
she
said
i
came
into
the
and
arabella
pulled
that
garment
of
miss
cobb
off
a
table
it
was
early
nobody
was
out
yet
you
were
alone
minnie
or
no
she
said
suddenly
you
were
not
alone
minnie
who
was
in
the
pantry
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
managed
with
my
feet
as
cold
as
stone
she
got
up
and
buttoned
her
sweater
do
trouble
to
lie
she
said
i
can
see
through
a
stone
wall
as
well
as
most
people
whoever
got
those
letters
thought
they
were
stealing
mine
and
there
are
only
two
people
who
would
try
to
steal
my
letters
one
is
dick
carter
and
the
other
is
his
it
was
sam
in
the
pantry
he
came
in
just
after
with
his
little
snip
of
a
wife
well
i
managed
but
she
was
smiling
again
not
so
pleasantly
i
might
have
known
it
she
said
what
a
fool
i
been
minnie
and
how
clever
you
are
under
that
red
thatch
of
yours
dicky
can
not
appear
as
long
as
i
am
here
and
pierce
takes
his
place
and
i
help
to
keep
the
secret
and
to
play
the
game
well
i
can
appreciate
a
joke
on
myself
as
well
as
most
people
but
minnie
minnie
think
of
that
guilty
wretch
of
a
dicky
carter
shaking
in
the
pantry
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
said
but
she
only
winked
and
went
to
the
door
do
take
it
too
much
to
heart
she
advised
too
much
loyalty
is
a
vice
not
a
virtue
and
another
piece
of
advice
minnie
when
i
find
dicky
carter
stand
from
under
something
will
fall
they
had
charades
during
the
rest
hour
that
afternoon
the
overweights
headed
by
the
bishop
against
the
underweights
headed
by
moody
they
selected
their
words
from
one
of
horace
fletcher
books
and
as
pierce
was
either
over
or
underweight
they
asked
him
to
be
referee
oh
they
were
crazy
about
him
by
that
time
it
was
carter
here
and
dear
carter
there
with
the
women
knitting
him
neckties
and
the
men
coming
up
to
be
bullied
and
asking
for
more
and
he
kept
the
upper
hand
too
once
he
got
it
it
was
that
day
i
think
that
he
sent
senator
biggs
up
to
make
his
bed
again
and
nobody
in
the
place
will
ever
forget
how
he
made
old
jennings
hang
his
gymnasium
suit
up
three
times
before
it
was
done
properly
the
old
man
was
mad
enough
at
the
time
but
inside
of
twenty
minutes
he
was
offering
pierce
the
cigar
he
won
in
the
contest
but
if
pierce
was
making
a
hit
with
the
guests
he
was
so
popular
with
the
van
alstynes
or
the
carters
the
night
the
cigar
stand
was
closed
sam
came
to
me
and
leaned
over
the
counter
put
the
key
in
a
drawer
he
said
i
can
slip
down
here
after
the
lights
are
out
and
get
a
smoke
ca
do
it
van
alstyne
i
said
got
positive
orders
that
does
include
me
he
was
still
perfectly
sorry
i
said
have
to
have
a
written
order
from
mr
pierce
he
put
a
silver
dollar
on
the
desk
between
us
and
looked
at
me
over
it
will
that
open
the
case
he
asked
but
i
shook
my
head
well
i
be
hanged
what
the
devil
sort
of
order
did
he
give
you
he
said
i
repeated
that
i
be
coaxed
and
probably
bribed
to
open
the
cigar
case
and
that
you
probably
be
the
first
one
to
do
it
but
i
was
to
stick
firm
you
been
smoking
too
much
and
your
nerves
are
going
insolent
young
puppy
he
exclaimed
angrily
and
stamped
away
so
that
i
was
not
surprised
when
on
that
night
friday
i
was
told
to
be
at
the
at
ten
for
a
protest
meeting
sam
told
me
something
has
to
be
done
she
said
i
do
intend
to
stand
much
more
nobody
has
the
right
to
say
when
i
shall
eat
or
what
if
i
want
to
eat
fried
shoe
leather
that
my
affair
we
met
at
ten
at
the
everybody
having
gone
to
bed
miss
patty
the
van
alstynes
and
myself
the
dickys
were
on
good
terms
again
for
a
wonder
and
when
we
went
in
they
were
in
front
of
the
fire
she
on
a
box
and
he
at
her
feet
with
his
head
buried
in
her
lap
he
did
even
look
up
when
we
entered
they
here
dicky
she
said
all
right
he
answered
in
a
smothered
voice
how
many
of
four
she
said
and
kissed
the
tip
of
his
ear
for
goodness
sake
dick
sam
snapped
in
a
disgusted
tone
stop
that
spooning
and
get
us
something
to
sit
on
help
yourself
he
replied
still
from
his
wife
lap
and
do
be
jealous
sis
if
the
sight
of
married
happiness
upsets
you
go
away
go
away
anyhow
sam
came
over
and
jerked
him
into
a
sitting
position
either
sit
up
and
take
part
in
this
discussion
he
said
angrily
or
you
go
out
in
the
snow
until
it
over
dick
leaned
over
and
kissed
his
wife
hand
a
cruel
fate
is
separating
us
he
explained
but
try
to
endure
it
until
i
return
i
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
miss
patty
came
to
the
fire
and
stood
warming
her
hands
i
saw
her
sister
watching
her
what
wrong
with
you
pat
she
asked
oskar
not
behaving
do
be
silly
miss
patty
said
i
all
right
she
worked
to
death
sam
put
in
look
at
all
of
us
i
tell
you
i
so
tired
these
nights
that
by
nine
i
asleep
on
my
feet
i
tired
to
death
but
i
do
sleep
miss
patty
said
i
i
know
why
i
do
her
sister
said
if
you
were
so
haughty
pat
and
would
just
own
up
that
you
sick
of
your
bargain
dolly
miss
patty
got
red
and
then
white
oh
all
right
dicky
said
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
only
i
hate
to
see
you
make
an
idiot
of
yourself
when
i
so
happy
dick
made
a
move
at
that
to
go
across
the
fireplace
to
her
but
sam
pushed
him
back
where
he
was
you
stay
right
there
he
said
here
pierce
now
he
came
in
smiling
and
as
he
stood
inside
the
door
brushing
the
snow
off
it
was
queer
to
see
how
his
eyes
went
around
the
circle
until
found
miss
patty
and
stopped
at
her
nobody
answered
his
smile
and
he
came
over
to
the
fire
beside
miss
patty
great
night
he
said
looking
down
at
her
there
something
invigorating
in
just
breathing
that
wind
do
you
think
so
sam
said
disagreeably
of
course
we
all
got
your
shoulders
that
so
he
answered
turning
to
her
i
said
you
women
should
not
come
so
far
we
could
have
met
in
my
you
forget
one
thing
dick
put
in
disagreeably
and
that
is
that
this
meeting
concerns
me
and
i
can
not
very
well
go
to
your
fact
said
pierce
i
forgotten
about
you
for
the
moment
you
generally
do
dick
retorted
if
you
want
the
truth
pierce
i
about
tired
of
your
methods
pierce
set
his
jaw
and
looked
down
at
him
why
i
saved
the
place
have
i
why
look
here
he
said
and
pulled
out
a
couple
of
letters
these
are
the
first
fruits
of
those
that
weep
in
other
words
per
aspera
ad
astra
two
new
guests
coming
the
last
of
the
week
want
to
be
put
in
training
well
that
was
an
argument
nobody
could
find
fault
with
but
their
grievance
was
about
themselves
and
they
could
forgive
him
they
turned
on
him
in
the
most
heartless
way
even
miss
patty
and
demanded
that
he
give
them
special
privileges
breakfast
when
they
wanted
it
and
sam
the
key
to
the
bar
and
he
stood
firm
as
he
had
that
day
in
the
lobby
and
let
the
storm
beat
around
him
looking
mostly
at
miss
patty
it
was
more
than
i
could
bear
shame
on
all
of
you
i
said
he
done
what
he
promised
he
do
and
more
if
he
did
what
he
ought
he
leave
this
minute
and
let
you
find
out
for
yourself
what
it
is
to
drive
different
stomachs
and
the
same
number
of
bad
dispositions
in
one
direction
you
are
perfectly
right
minnie
miss
patty
said
we
beastly
all
of
us
and
i
sorry
she
went
over
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
you
done
the
impossible
she
told
him
he
beamed
your
approval
means
more
than
anything
he
said
holding
her
hand
dick
sat
up
and
opened
her
eyes
wide
speaking
of
oskar
she
began
and
then
stopped
staring
past
her
sister
toward
the
door
we
all
turned
and
there
blinking
in
the
light
was
miss
summers
chapter
xxvi
over
the
fence
is
out
well
she
said
and
stood
staring
then
she
smiled
i
guess
our
faces
were
funny
may
i
come
in
she
asked
and
without
waiting
she
came
in
and
closed
the
door
you
do
look
cozy
she
said
and
shook
herself
free
of
snow
dick
had
turned
white
he
got
up
with
his
eyes
on
her
and
twice
he
opened
his
mouth
and
could
speak
he
backed
still
watching
her
to
his
wife
and
stood
in
front
of
her
as
if
to
protect
her
sam
got
his
voice
first
b
bad
night
for
a
walk
he
said
frightful
she
said
i
been
buried
to
my
knees
may
i
sit
down
to
those
of
us
who
knew
her
easy
manner
had
something
horrible
in
it
sorry
there
are
no
chairs
julia
pierce
said
sit
on
the
cot
wo
you
who
is
it
dick
asked
from
as
you
may
say
her
eclipse
she
and
miss
summers
were
the
only
calm
ones
in
the
room
i
i
do
know
dick
stammered
but
the
next
moment
miss
julia
from
the
cot
looked
across
at
him
and
grinned
well
dicky
she
said
who
have
thought
it
you
said
you
did
know
her
his
wife
said
from
behind
him
who
have
thought
wha
what
he
asked
with
bravado
all
this
miss
julia
waved
her
hand
around
the
room
with
its
bare
walls
and
blankets
over
the
windows
to
keep
the
light
in
and
the
cold
out
and
the
circle
of
us
sitting
around
on
sand
boxes
from
the
links
and
lawn
rollers
to
find
you
here
all
snug
in
your
own
home
with
your
household
gods
and
a
wife
nobody
could
think
of
anything
to
say
that
is
she
went
on
i
believe
there
is
a
wife
good
heavens
dicky
it
is
minnie
he
stepped
aside
at
that
disclosing
dick
on
her
box
with
her
childish
eyes
wide
open
there
there
is
a
wife
julia
he
said
this
is
her
she
well
she
come
out
to
make
mischief
it
was
written
all
over
her
when
she
came
in
the
door
but
when
dick
presented
his
wife
frightened
as
he
was
and
still
proud
of
her
and
dick
smiled
in
her
pretty
way
miss
summers
just
walked
across
and
looked
down
at
her
with
a
queer
look
on
her
face
i
shut
my
eyes
and
waited
for
the
crash
but
nothing
came
and
when
i
opened
them
again
there
were
the
two
women
holding
hands
and
miss
summers
smiling
a
sort
of
crooked
grin
at
dick
i
ought
to
be
very
angry
with
your
husband
she
said
i
well
i
never
expected
him
to
marry
without
my
being
among
those
present
but
since
he
has
done
it
dick
you
wretched
boy
you
took
advantage
of
my
being
laid
up
with
the
mumps
mumps
dick
said
why
he
has
just
had
them
himself
she
looked
around
the
circle
suspiciously
and
every
one
of
us
looked
as
guilty
as
if
he
had
been
caught
with
the
mumps
concealed
around
him
somewhere
i
did
have
real
mumps
dick
explained
it
was
only
er
a
swelling
you
said
it
was
mumps
and
even
now
you
hate
pickles
pierce
had
edged
over
to
miss
summers
and
patted
her
shoulder
be
a
good
sport
julia
he
whispered
she
threw
off
his
hand
i
being
an
idiot
she
said
angrily
dick
an
ass
and
he
treated
me
like
a
villain
but
look
at
that
baby
it
will
be
twenty
years
before
she
has
to
worry
about
her
weight
i
never
cared
for
pickles
dick
was
saying
with
dignity
the
doctor
said
i
think
we
better
be
going
miss
patty
got
up
and
gathered
up
her
cloak
but
if
she
meant
to
break
up
the
party
miss
summers
was
not
ready
if
you
do
mind
she
said
i
stay
i
frozen
and
i
got
to
go
home
and
sleep
with
my
window
up
you
lucky
she
went
on
to
the
dickys
i
dare
say
the
air
in
here
would
scare
us
under
a
microscope
but
at
least
it
is
warm
the
van
alstynes
made
a
move
to
go
but
dicky
frantically
gestured
to
them
not
to
leave
him
alone
and
sam
sat
down
again
sulkily
pierce
picked
up
his
cap
i
take
you
back
he
said
to
miss
patty
and
his
face
was
fairly
glowing
but
miss
patty
slipped
her
arm
through
mine
come
minnie
pierce
is
going
to
take
us
she
said
i
i
rather
go
alone
i
said
nonsense
i
not
ready
i
got
to
gather
up
these
dishes
i
objected
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
could
see
the
glow
dying
out
of
pierce
face
but
miss
patty
took
my
arm
and
led
me
to
the
door
let
them
gather
up
their
own
dishes
she
said
dolly
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
let
minnie
slave
for
you
the
way
she
does
good
night
everybody
i
did
my
best
to
leave
them
alone
on
the
way
back
but
miss
patty
stuck
close
to
my
heels
it
was
snowing
and
the
going
was
slow
for
the
first
five
minutes
she
only
spoke
once
and
so
miss
summers
and
dicky
carter
are
old
friends
it
appears
so
pierce
said
she
rather
magnanimous
under
the
circumstances
miss
patty
remarked
demurely
under
what
circumstances
i
heard
her
laugh
a
little
behind
me
never
mind
she
said
you
need
tell
me
anything
you
do
care
to
but
what
a
stew
you
must
all
have
been
in
there
was
a
minute
silence
behind
me
and
then
pierce
laughed
too
stew
he
said
for
the
last
few
days
i
been
either
paralyzed
with
fright
or
electrified
into
wild
bursts
of
mendacity
and
i
not
naturally
a
liar
really
she
retorted
what
an
actor
you
are
they
laughed
together
at
that
and
i
gained
a
little
on
them
at
the
corner
where
the
path
skirted
the
deer
park
and
turned
toward
the
house
i
lost
them
altogether
and
i
floundered
on
alone
but
i
had
not
gone
twenty
feet
when
i
stopped
suddenly
about
fifty
yards
ahead
a
lantern
was
coming
toward
me
through
the
snow
and
i
could
hear
a
man
voice
breathless
and
gasping
set
it
down
it
said
the
damned
thing
must
be
filled
with
lead
it
sounded
like
thoburn
it
the
snow
another
voice
replied
von
inwald
i
told
you
it
would
take
two
trips
yes
thoburn
retorted
breathing
in
groans
stay
up
all
night
to
get
the
blamed
stuff
here
and
then
get
up
at
dawn
for
a
cold
bath
and
a
walk
and
an
apple
for
breakfast
ugh
my
shoulder
is
dislocated
i
turned
and
flew
back
to
miss
patty
and
pierce
they
had
stopped
in
the
shelter
of
the
fence
corner
and
pierce
was
on
his
knees
in
front
of
her
i
was
so
astounded
that
i
forgot
for
the
moment
what
had
brought
me
just
a
second
he
was
saying
it
ice
on
the
heel
please
get
up
off
your
knees
you
take
cold
never
had
a
cold
i
scrape
it
off
with
my
knife
why
do
you
wear
overshoes
i
never
have
a
cold
she
retorted
why
minnie
is
that
you
quick
i
panted
thoburn
and
von
inwald
coming
basket
lantern
warn
the
great
scott
pierce
said
here
you
girls
crawl
over
the
fence
you
be
hidden
there
i
run
back
and
warn
them
the
lantern
was
swinging
again
thoburn
grumbling
came
to
us
through
the
snow
monotonous
and
steady
i
ca
climb
the
fence
miss
patty
said
pitifully
but
pierce
had
gone
i
reached
my
basket
through
the
bars
and
climbed
the
fence
in
a
hurry
miss
patty
had
got
almost
to
the
top
and
was
standing
there
on
one
rail
staring
across
at
me
through
the
darkness
i
ca
minnie
she
whispered
hopelessly
i
never
could
climb
a
fence
and
in
this
skirt
quick
i
said
in
a
low
tone
the
lantern
was
very
close
put
your
leg
over
she
did
and
sat
there
looking
down
at
me
like
a
scared
baby
now
the
other
i
i
ca
she
whispered
if
i
put
them
both
over
i
fall
hurry
with
a
little
grunt
she
put
the
other
foot
over
sat
a
minute
with
agony
in
her
face
and
her
arms
out
then
she
slid
off
with
a
squeal
and
brought
up
in
a
sitting
position
inside
the
fence
corner
i
dropped
beside
her
what
was
that
noise
said
thoburn
almost
upon
us
moving
inside
that
fence
corner
it
them
deers
mike
voice
this
time
we
could
make
out
the
three
figures
darned
nuisance
them
deers
is
they
have
been
shot
long
ago
if
the
girl
had
objected
she
thinks
she
the
whole
cheese
around
here
set
it
down
again
von
inwald
panted
we
heard
the
rattle
of
bottles
as
they
put
down
the
basket
and
the
next
instant
thoburn
fat
hand
was
resting
on
the
rail
of
the
fence
over
our
heads
i
could
feel
miss
patty
trembling
beside
me
but
he
did
look
over
he
stood
there
resting
breathing
hard
and
swearing
at
the
weather
while
mike
waited
in
surly
silence
and
the
von
inwald
cursed
in
german
after
my
heart
had
been
beating
in
my
ears
for
about
three
years
the
fat
hand
moved
and
i
heard
the
rattle
of
glass
again
and
thoburn
groan
as
he
bent
over
his
half
of
the
load
on
my
partners
in
distress
my
comrades
through
this
wilderness
he
said
and
the
others
grunted
and
started
on
when
they
had
disappeared
in
the
snow
we
got
out
of
our
cramped
position
and
prepared
to
scurry
home
i
climbed
the
fence
and
looked
after
them
humph
i
said
i
guess
that
basket
is
for
the
hungry
poor
give
a
good
bit
to
know
then
i
turned
and
looked
for
miss
patty
she
was
flat
on
the
snow
crawling
between
the
two
lower
rails
of
the
fence
have
you
no
shame
i
demanded
she
looked
up
at
me
with
her
head
and
half
her
long
sealskin
coat
through
the
fence
none
she
said
pitifully
minnie
i
stuck
perfectly
tight
you
ought
to
be
left
as
you
are
i
said
jerking
at
her
for
people
to
come
jerk
to
look
at
jerk
she
came
through
at
that
and
we
lay
together
in
the
snow
and
like
to
burst
a
rib
laughing
you
never
be
a
princess
miss
patty
i
declared
you
too
lowly
minded
she
sat
up
suddenly
and
straightened
her
sealskin
cap
on
her
head
i
wish
she
said
unpleasantly
i
wish
you
would
always
drag
in
disagreeable
things
minnie
and
she
was
sulky
all
the
way
to
the
house
miss
summers
came
to
my
room
that
night
as
i
was
putting
my
bottle
to
bed
in
a
silk
wrapper
with
a
band
of
fur
around
the
low
neck
miss
summers
of
course
not
the
bottle
well
she
said
sitting
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
staring
at
me
well
young
woman
for
a
person
who
has
never
been
farther
away
than
finleyville
you
do
pretty
well
do
what
i
asked
with
the
covers
up
to
my
chin
do
what
miss
innocence
she
said
mockingly
you
the
only
woman
i
ever
saw
who
did
look
as
sophisticated
as
the
devil
i
tell
you
one
thing
though
she
reached
down
into
the
pocket
of
her
and
brought
up
a
cigarette
and
a
match
you
never
had
me
fooled
for
a
minute
she
looked
at
me
over
the
match
i
lay
and
stared
back
and
another
thing
she
said
i
never
had
any
real
intention
of
marrying
dicky
carter
and
raising
a
baby
sanatorium
i
would
have
the
face
to
ask
arabella
to
live
here
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
miss
summers
i
said
i
gone
through
a
lot
i
an
old
woman
in
the
last
two
weeks
my
hair
falling
from
its
having
to
stand
up
on
end
half
the
time
she
leaned
over
and
put
her
cigarette
on
the
back
of
my
celluloid
mirror
and
then
suddenly
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
minnie
she
said
between
fits
minnie
as
long
as
i
live
i
never
forget
that
wretched
boy
face
and
the
sand
boxes
and
the
blankets
over
the
windows
and
the
tarpaulin
over
the
rafters
and
van
alstyne
sitting
on
the
lawnmower
i
rather
have
had
my
minute
in
that
doorway
than
fifty
thousand
dollars
if
you
had
had
to
carry
out
all
those
things
i
began
but
she
checked
me
listen
she
said
somebody
with
brains
has
got
to
take
you
young
people
in
hand
you
not
able
to
look
after
yourselves
i
fond
of
alan
pierce
for
one
thing
and
i
do
care
to
see
a
sanatorium
that
might
have
been
the
child
of
my
solicitude
kidnaped
and
reared
as
a
summer
hotel
by
papa
thoburn
a
good
fat
man
is
very
very
good
minnie
but
when
he
is
bad
he
is
horrid
it
too
late
i
objected
feebly
he
ca
get
it
now
ca
he
she
got
up
and
yawned
stretching
well
i
lay
you
ten
to
one
that
if
we
do
get
busy
he
have
the
house
empty
in
hours
and
a
bill
of
sale
on
it
in
as
many
days
the
celluloid
mirror
blazed
up
at
that
minute
and
she
poured
the
contents
of
my
over
the
dresser
for
the
next
hour
while
i
was
emptying
water
out
of
the
bureau
drawers
and
hanging
up
my
clothes
to
dry
she
told
me
what
she
knew
of
thoburn
scheme
and
it
turned
me
cold
but
i
went
to
bed
finally
just
as
i
was
dozing
off
somebody
opened
my
door
and
i
heard
a
curious
scraping
along
the
floor
i
turned
on
the
light
and
there
was
arabella
and
a
solid
silver
with
a
card
on
it
to
minnie
to
replace
the
one
that
blew
up
chapter
xxvii
a
cupboard
full
of
rye
doctor
barnes
came
to
me
at
the
news
stand
the
next
morning
before
gymnasium
well
he
said
you
look
as
busy
as
a
dog
with
fleas
have
you
heard
the
glad
tidings
what
i
asked
without
much
spirit
i
heard
considerable
tidings
lately
and
not
much
of
it
has
cheered
me
up
any
he
leaned
over
and
ran
his
fingers
up
through
his
hair
you
know
miss
minnie
he
said
somebody
ought
kindly
to
kill
our
friend
thoburn
or
he
come
to
a
bad
end
shall
i
do
it
or
will
you
i
said
filling
up
the
jar
pierce
had
taken
away
the
candy
case
doctor
barnes
glanced
around
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
near
and
leaned
farther
over
the
cupboard
is
empty
now
he
said
not
for
nothing
did
i
spend
part
of
the
night
in
the
nest
by
the
way
did
you
ever
hear
that
touching
story
about
little
sally
walking
up
and
laying
an
egg
i
see
you
have
what
do
you
think
is
in
the
cupboard
i
know
about
it
i
said
shortly
liquor
in
a
case
labeled
breakable
a
song
of
sixpence
a
cupboard
full
of
rye
he
said
almost
a
goal
but
not
only
liquors
my
little
friend
champagne
cases
of
it
caviar
canned
grouse
with
truffles
lobster
cheeses
fine
cigars
everything
you
could
think
of
erotic
exotic
and
narcotic
an
orgy
in
cans
and
bottles
a
bacchanalian
revel
a
cupboard
full
of
indigestion
joy
forgetfulness
and
katzenjammer
oh
my
suffering
palate
to
have
to
leave
it
all
without
one
sniff
one
sip
one
nibble
he
wasting
his
money
i
said
they
all
crazy
about
the
simple
life
he
looked
around
and
seeing
no
one
in
the
lobby
reached
over
and
took
one
of
my
hands
strange
he
said
looking
at
it
no
webs
and
yet
it
been
an
amphibious
little
creature
most
of
its
life
my
dear
girl
our
friend
thoburn
is
a
rascal
but
he
is
also
a
student
of
mankind
and
a
philosopher
gee
he
said
think
of
a
woman
fighting
her
way
alone
through
the
world
with
a
bit
of
a
fist
like
that
i
jerked
my
hand
away
it
like
this
my
dear
he
said
human
nature
a
curious
thing
it
human
nature
for
instance
for
me
to
be
crazy
about
you
when
you
as
as
a
curly
porcupine
and
it
is
human
nature
by
the
same
token
to
like
to
be
bullied
especially
about
health
and
to
respect
and
admire
the
fellow
who
does
the
bullying
that
why
we
were
crazy
about
roosevelt
and
that
why
pierce
is
trailing
his
kingly
robes
over
them
while
they
lie
on
their
faces
and
eat
dirt
and
stewed
fruit
he
reached
for
my
hand
again
but
i
put
it
behind
me
but
alas
he
said
there
is
another
side
to
human
nature
and
our
friend
thoburn
has
not
kept
a
summer
hotel
for
nothing
it
is
notoriously
weak
especially
as
to
stomach
you
may
feed
prunes
and
bread
and
apple
sauce
and
after
a
while
they
forget
the
fat
days
and
remember
only
the
lean
and
hungry
ones
but
let
some
student
of
human
nature
at
the
proper
moment
introduce
just
one
fat
day
one
feast
one
revel
talk
english
i
said
sharply
do
break
in
on
my
flights
of
fancy
he
objected
if
you
want
the
truth
thoburn
is
going
to
have
a
party
a
forbidden
feast
he
going
to
rouse
again
the
sleeping
dogs
of
appetite
and
send
them
ravening
back
to
the
plaza
to
sherry
and
del
and
the
little
italian
restaurants
on
sixth
avenue
he
going
to
take
them
up
on
a
high
mountain
and
show
them
the
wines
and
delicatessen
of
the
earth
and
then
ask
them
if
they
going
to
be
bullied
into
eating
boiled
beef
and
cabbage
then
i
do
care
how
soon
he
does
it
i
said
despondently
rather
die
quickly
than
by
inches
die
he
said
not
a
bit
of
it
remember
our
friend
pierce
is
also
a
student
of
human
nature
he
thinking
it
out
now
in
the
cold
plunge
and
i
miss
my
guess
if
thoburn
has
got
a
stick
come
back
and
hit
him
on
the
head
he
had
been
playing
with
one
of
the
jars
and
when
he
had
gone
i
shoved
it
back
into
its
place
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
that
i
glanced
at
it
and
i
saw
that
he
had
slipped
a
small
white
box
inside
i
knew
i
was
being
a
silly
old
fool
but
my
heart
beat
fast
when
i
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
on
the
lid
was
written
for
a
good
girl
and
inside
lay
the
red
puffs
from
yost
window
down
in
finleyville
just
under
them
was
an
envelope
i
could
scarcely
see
to
open
it
dearest
minnie
the
note
inside
said
i
had
them
matched
to
my
own
thatch
and
i
think
they
match
yours
and
since
in
the
words
of
the
great
herbert
spencer
things
that
match
the
same
thing
match
each
other
what
do
you
say
barnes
i
love
you
i
feel
like
a
damn
fool
saying
it
but
heaven
knows
it
true
still
love
you
it
easier
the
second
time
n
i
love
you
got
the
habit
now
and
ca
stop
writing
b
well
i
had
to
keep
calm
and
attend
to
business
but
i
was
seething
inside
like
a
seidlitz
powder
every
few
minutes
i
reread
the
letter
under
the
edge
of
the
stand
and
the
more
i
read
it
the
more
excited
i
got
when
a
woman
gone
past
thirty
before
she
gets
her
first
she
is
sure
whether
to
thank
providence
or
the
man
but
she
pretty
sure
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
thoburn
came
to
the
news
stand
on
his
way
out
with
the
gang
to
the
pond
last
call
to
the
minnie
he
said
you
you
will
you
wo
you
will
you
join
the
dance
i
have
any
reason
for
changing
my
plans
i
retorted
i
promised
the
old
doctor
to
stick
by
the
place
and
i
sticking
as
the
man
said
when
he
sat
down
on
the
flypaper
you
going
by
your
heart
minnie
and
not
by
your
head
and
in
this
toss
heads
win
but
with
my
new
puffs
on
the
back
of
my
head
and
my
letter
in
my
pocket
i
was
easy
to
discourage
thoburn
shouldered
his
pick
and
headed
by
doctor
barnes
the
started
out
in
single
file
as
they
passed
the
news
stand
doctor
barnes
glanced
at
me
and
my
heart
almost
stopped
do
they
is
it
a
match
he
asked
with
his
eyes
on
mine
i
could
speak
but
i
nodded
yes
and
all
that
afternoon
i
could
see
the
wonderful
smile
that
lit
up
his
face
as
he
went
out
it
made
him
almost
oh
there
nothing
like
love
especially
if
waited
long
enough
to
be
hungry
for
it
and
not
spoiled
your
taste
for
it
by
a
bite
here
and
a
piece
of
a
heart
there
beforehand
so
to
speak
miss
cobb
stopped
at
the
news
stand
on
her
way
to
the
gymnasium
she
was
a
homely
woman
at
any
time
and
in
her
bloomers
she
looked
like
a
under
ordinary
circumstances
she
have
seen
the
puffs
from
the
staircase
and
have
asked
what
they
cost
and
told
me
they
match
in
one
breath
but
she
had
something
else
on
her
mind
she
padded
over
to
the
counter
in
her
gym
shoes
and
for
once
she
forgotten
her
legs
may
i
speak
to
you
minnie
she
asked
you
mostly
do
i
said
there
is
a
new
rule
about
speaking
is
there
this
is
important
minnie
she
said
rolling
her
eyes
around
as
she
always
did
when
she
was
excited
i
in
such
a
state
of
ex
i
see
you
bought
the
puffs
perhaps
you
will
lend
them
to
me
if
we
arrange
for
a
country
dance
they
do
match
i
objected
they
they
would
look
natural
miss
cobb
they
do
look
natural
on
you
either
do
you
suppose
anybody
believes
that
the
lord
sent
you
hair
in
seventeen
rows
of
pipes
so
that
red
as
it
is
it
looks
like
an
instantaneous
i
not
lending
them
i
said
firmly
it
would
have
been
like
lending
an
engagement
ring
to
my
mind
miss
cobb
was
not
offended
she
went
at
once
to
what
had
brought
her
and
bent
over
the
counter
where
the
summers
woman
she
asked
in
the
gym
she
made
herself
a
new
gym
suit
out
of
her
polka
dotted
silk
and
she
looks
lovely
humph
retorted
miss
cobb
minnie
you
love
miss
jennings
almost
like
a
daughter
do
you
like
a
sister
miss
cobb
i
said
i
not
feeble
yet
well
you
would
want
to
see
her
deceived
i
would
have
it
i
answered
then
what
do
you
call
this
she
put
a
small
package
on
the
counter
and
stared
at
me
over
it
there
treachery
here
black
treachery
she
pointed
one
long
thin
forefinger
at
the
bundle
what
is
it
a
bomb
i
asked
stepping
back
more
than
once
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
having
royalty
around
sometimes
meant
dynamite
miss
cobb
showed
her
teeth
yes
a
bomb
she
said
minnie
since
that
creature
took
my
letters
and
my
er
protectors
i
have
suspected
her
now
listen
yesterday
i
went
over
the
letters
and
i
missed
one
that
beautiful
one
in
verse
beginning
creature
of
the
slender
form
and
face
minnie
it
had
disappeared
melted
away
i
not
surprised
i
said
and
so
last
night
when
the
summers
woman
was
out
goodness
knows
where
blanche
moody
and
i
went
through
her
room
we
did
not
find
my
precious
missive
from
jones
but
we
did
find
these
minnie
tied
around
with
a
pink
silk
stocking
heavens
i
said
mockingly
not
a
pink
silk
pink
she
repeated
solemnly
minnie
i
have
felt
it
all
along
oskar
von
inwald
is
the
prince
himself
no
yes
and
more
than
that
he
is
making
desperate
love
to
miss
summers
three
of
those
letters
were
written
in
one
day
why
even
jones
the
wretch
i
cried
i
was
suddenly
savage
i
wanted
to
take
von
inwald
by
the
throat
and
choke
him
until
his
lying
tongue
was
black
to
put
the
letters
where
miss
patty
could
never
see
them
i
wanted
i
had
to
stop
to
sell
senator
biggs
some
and
when
he
had
gone
miss
cobb
was
reaching
out
for
the
bundle
i
snatched
it
from
her
give
me
those
letters
instantly
she
cried
shrilly
but
i
marched
from
behind
the
counter
and
over
to
the
fireplace
never
i
said
and
put
the
package
on
the
log
when
they
were
safely
blazing
i
turned
and
looked
at
miss
cobb
i
put
my
hand
right
beside
those
letters
to
save
miss
patty
a
heartache
i
said
and
you
know
it
you
a
fool
she
was
raging
you
let
her
marry
him
and
have
the
heartaches
afterward
she
wo
marry
him
i
snapped
and
walked
away
with
my
chin
up
leaving
her
staring
but
i
was
so
sure
as
i
pretended
to
be
von
inwald
and
jennings
had
been
closeted
together
most
of
the
morning
and
von
inwald
was
whistling
as
he
started
out
for
the
military
walk
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
thing
that
had
given
pierce
his
chance
to
make
good
had
improved
jennings
disposition
enough
to
remove
the
last
barrier
to
miss
jennings
wedding
with
somebody
else
well
what
one
man
meat
is
another
man
poison
chapter
xxviii
love
love
love
even
if
we
had
known
we
have
guessed
there
was
something
in
the
air
there
was
an
air
of
subdued
excitement
during
the
rest
hour
in
the
and
a
good
bit
of
whispering
and
laughing
in
groups
which
would
break
up
with
faces
as
long
as
the
moral
law
the
moment
they
saw
my
eye
on
them
they
were
planning
a
mutiny
as
you
may
say
and
i
guess
no
sailors
on
a
pirate
ship
were
more
afraid
of
the
captain
fist
than
they
were
of
pierce
disapproval
he
been
smart
enough
to
see
that
most
of
them
having
bullied
other
people
all
their
lives
liked
the
novelty
of
being
bullied
themselves
and
now
they
were
getting
a
new
thrill
by
having
a
revolt
they
were
terribly
worked
up
miss
patty
stayed
after
the
others
had
gone
sitting
in
front
of
the
empty
fireplace
in
the
same
chair
pierce
usually
took
and
keeping
her
back
to
me
when
i
finished
folding
the
steamer
rugs
and
putting
them
away
i
went
around
and
stood
in
front
of
her
your
eyes
are
red
i
remarked
i
got
a
cold
she
was
very
haughty
your
nose
is
red
i
insisted
and
anyhow
you
say
you
never
have
a
cold
i
wish
you
would
let
me
alone
minnie
she
turned
her
back
to
me
i
dare
say
i
may
have
a
cold
if
i
wish
do
you
know
what
they
are
saying
here
i
demanded
do
you
know
that
miss
cobb
has
found
out
in
some
way
or
other
who
von
inwald
is
and
that
the
four
gossip
edition
says
your
father
has
given
his
consent
and
that
you
can
go
and
buy
a
diadem
or
whatever
you
are
going
to
wear
right
off
well
she
said
in
a
choked
voice
with
her
back
to
me
what
of
it
did
you
and
pierce
both
do
your
best
to
bring
it
about
our
what
i
could
believe
my
ears
you
made
father
well
he
so
p
pleasant
he
do
anything
except
leave
this
awful
place
well
of
all
the
ungrateful
people
i
began
and
then
pierce
came
in
he
had
a
curious
way
of
stopping
when
he
saw
her
as
if
she
just
took
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
so
to
speak
and
then
of
whipping
off
his
hat
if
anything
with
sails
can
wear
a
hat
and
going
up
to
her
with
his
heart
in
his
eyes
he
always
went
straight
to
her
and
stopped
suddenly
about
two
feet
away
trying
to
think
of
something
ordinary
to
say
because
the
extraordinary
thing
he
wanted
to
say
was
always
on
the
end
of
his
tongue
but
this
day
he
did
light
up
when
he
saw
her
he
went
through
all
the
other
motions
but
his
mouth
was
set
in
a
straight
line
and
when
he
came
close
to
her
and
looked
down
his
eyes
were
hard
it
been
my
experience
of
men
that
the
younger
they
are
the
harder
they
take
things
and
the
more
uncompromising
they
are
it
takes
a
good
many
years
and
some
pretty
hard
knocks
to
make
people
tolerant
i
was
looking
for
you
he
said
to
her
the
bishop
has
just
told
me
there
are
no
obstacles
now
none
she
said
looking
up
at
him
with
wretchedness
in
her
eyes
if
he
had
only
seen
i
am
very
happy
she
was
just
saying
i
said
bitterly
how
grateful
she
was
to
both
of
us
i
do
understand
it
is
not
hard
to
understand
she
said
smiling
i
wanted
to
slap
her
father
was
unreasonable
because
he
was
you
have
made
him
well
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
but
she
rather
overdid
the
joy
part
of
it
and
he
leaned
over
and
looked
in
her
face
i
think
i
stupid
he
said
i
know
i
unhappy
but
is
that
what
i
was
to
do
to
make
them
well
if
i
could
how
could
anybody
know
she
began
angrily
and
then
stopped
you
have
done
even
more
she
said
sweetly
you
turned
them
into
cherubims
and
seraphims
butter
would
melt
in
their
mouths
ugh
how
i
hate
amiability
raised
to
the
nth
power
he
smiled
i
think
it
was
getting
through
his
thick
man
skull
that
she
was
so
happy
as
she
should
have
been
and
he
was
thrilled
through
and
through
my
amiability
must
be
the
reason
you
dislike
me
he
suggested
they
had
both
forgotten
me
do
i
dislike
you
she
asked
raising
her
eyebrows
i
never
really
thought
about
it
but
i
sure
i
do
she
did
look
at
him
she
looked
at
me
she
knew
i
knew
she
lied
his
smile
faded
well
he
said
speaking
of
disliking
amiability
you
do
hate
yourself
i
sure
you
are
wrong
she
retorted
i
loathe
myself
and
she
walked
to
the
window
he
took
a
step
or
two
after
her
why
do
it
at
all
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
you
do
love
him
you
ca
and
if
it
is
love
he
remembered
me
suddenly
and
stopped
please
go
on
she
said
sweetly
from
the
window
do
not
mind
minnie
she
is
my
conscience
anyhow
she
is
always
scolding
me
you
might
both
scold
in
chorus
i
would
presume
to
scold
then
give
me
a
little
advice
and
look
superior
and
righteous
accustomed
to
that
also
as
long
as
you
are
in
this
mood
i
ca
give
you
anything
but
a
very
good
day
he
said
angrily
and
went
toward
the
door
but
when
he
had
almost
reached
it
he
turned
i
will
say
this
he
said
you
have
known
for
three
days
that
thoburn
was
going
to
have
a
supper
and
you
did
let
us
know
you
must
have
known
his
purpose
i
guess
i
was
as
surprised
as
she
was
i
never
suspected
she
knew
she
looked
at
him
over
her
shoulder
why
should
he
have
a
supper
she
demanded
angrily
starving
we
all
starving
for
decent
food
i
kept
here
against
my
will
why
should
i
have
one
respectable
meal
you
with
your
wretched
stewed
fruits
and
breads
ugh
i
sorry
thoburn
idea
of
course
is
to
make
the
guests
discontented
so
they
will
leave
oh
she
said
she
had
thought
of
that
and
she
flushed
at
least
she
said
you
must
give
me
credit
for
not
trying
to
spoil
dick
and
dolly
chance
here
we
are
going
to
allow
the
party
to
go
on
he
said
still
stiff
and
uncompromising
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
accepted
her
bit
of
apology
how
kind
of
you
i
dare
say
he
would
have
it
anyhow
she
was
sarcastic
again
probably
and
you
will
go
certainly
even
when
the
result
oh
do
preach
she
said
putting
her
hands
to
her
ears
if
you
and
minnie
want
to
preach
why
do
you
preach
at
each
other
minnie
talks
love
love
and
you
preach
health
and
morality
you
drive
me
crazy
between
you
suppose
he
said
with
a
gleam
in
his
eyes
suppose
i
preach
love
love
she
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
again
say
it
to
minnie
she
cried
and
turned
her
back
to
him
very
well
he
said
minnie
miss
jennings
refuses
to
listen
and
there
are
some
things
i
must
say
once
again
i
am
going
to
register
a
protest
against
her
throwing
herself
away
in
a
loveless
marriage
i
i
feel
strongly
on
the
subject
minnie
she
half
turned
as
if
to
interrupt
then
she
thought
better
of
it
and
kept
her
fingers
in
her
ears
her
face
flushed
but
he
had
learned
what
he
hoped
that
she
could
hear
him
you
ask
me
why
i
feel
so
strongly
minnie
and
you
are
right
to
ask
under
ordinary
circumstances
minnie
any
remark
of
mine
on
the
subject
would
be
ridiculous
impertinence
he
stopped
and
eyed
her
back
but
she
did
not
move
it
is
impertinence
under
any
circumstances
but
consider
the
provocation
i
see
a
young
beautiful
and
sensitive
girl
marrying
frankly
without
love
a
man
whom
i
know
to
be
unworthy
and
you
ask
me
to
stand
aside
and
allow
it
to
happen
are
you
still
preaching
she
asked
coldly
over
her
shoulder
it
must
be
a
long
sermon
and
then
knowing
he
had
only
a
moment
more
his
voice
changed
and
became
deep
and
earnest
his
hands
that
were
clutching
a
took
a
stronger
hold
so
that
the
ends
of
the
nails
were
white
you
see
minnie
he
said
turning
a
little
pale
i
i
love
miss
jennings
myself
you
have
known
it
a
long
time
for
you
love
her
too
it
has
come
to
the
point
that
i
measure
the
day
by
the
hours
when
i
can
see
her
she
does
care
for
me
sometimes
i
think
she
hates
me
he
paused
here
but
miss
patty
did
move
i
have
anything
to
offer
a
woman
except
a
clean
life
and
the
kind
of
love
that
a
woman
could
be
proud
of
i
have
no
title
miss
patty
suddenly
took
her
fingers
out
of
her
ears
and
turned
around
she
was
flushed
and
shaken
but
she
looked
past
him
without
blinking
an
eyelash
to
me
dear
me
she
said
the
sermon
must
have
been
exciting
minnie
you
are
quite
trembly
and
with
that
she
picked
up
her
muff
and
went
out
with
not
a
glance
at
him
he
looked
at
me
well
he
said
that
over
she
angry
minnie
and
she
never
forgive
me
stuff
i
snapped
i
notice
she
waited
to
hear
it
all
and
no
real
woman
ever
hated
a
man
for
saying
he
loved
her
chapter
xxix
a
big
night
i
carried
out
the
supper
to
the
as
usual
that
night
but
i
might
have
saved
myself
the
trouble
dicky
was
sitting
on
a
box
with
her
hair
in
puffs
and
the
folding
before
her
and
dick
was
uncorking
a
bottle
of
champagne
with
a
nail
there
were
two
or
three
cans
open
on
the
table
dick
looked
at
my
basket
and
turned
up
her
nose
put
it
anywhere
minnie
she
said
loftily
i
dare
say
it
contain
anything
reckless
cold
ham
and
egg
salad
i
said
setting
it
down
with
a
slam
stewed
prunes
and
boiled
rice
for
dessert
if
those
cans
taste
as
they
smell
you
better
keep
the
basket
to
fall
back
on
where
you
get
that
dick
looked
at
me
over
the
bottle
and
winked
in
the
next
room
he
said
iced
to
the
proper
temperature
paid
for
by
somebody
else
and
coming
after
a
drought
minnie
there
is
a
shadow
on
my
joy
he
miss
it
i
said
but
dick
was
pouring
out
three
large
tumblersful
of
the
stuff
and
he
held
one
out
to
me
miss
it
he
exclaimed
has
he
been
out
three
times
tapping
his
little
cache
and
did
he
bring
out
moody
and
the
senator
and
von
inwald
this
afternoon
and
did
they
sit
in
the
next
room
there
from
two
to
four
roaring
songs
and
cracking
bottles
and
jokes
beasts
dicky
said
savagely
two
hours
and
we
dare
move
drink
pretty
creature
dick
said
motioning
to
my
glass
be
afraid
of
it
minnie
it
food
and
drink
i
do
like
it
i
said
sipping
at
it
i
rather
have
the
spring
water
you
have
to
cultivate
a
taste
for
it
he
explained
you
like
the
second
half
better
i
got
it
down
somehow
and
started
for
the
door
dick
came
after
me
with
something
that
smelled
fishy
on
the
end
of
a
fork
better
eat
something
he
suggested
that
was
considerable
champagne
minnie
stuff
and
nonsense
i
said
i
was
tired
and
it
has
rested
me
all
mr
dick
sure
certainly
i
said
with
dignity
i
really
rested
dick
and
happy
i
very
happy
mr
dick
perhaps
i
better
close
the
door
he
said
the
light
may
be
seen
you
need
close
it
until
i
finished
talking
i
said
i
done
my
best
for
you
and
yours
dick
i
hope
you
appreciate
it
night
after
night
i
tramped
out
here
through
the
snow
and
lost
sleep
and
lied
myself
black
in
the
face
you
no
idea
how
i
had
to
lie
mr
dick
come
in
and
shut
the
door
dick
dick
called
i
freezing
that
made
me
mad
exactly
i
said
glaring
at
her
through
the
doorway
exactly
i
can
wade
through
the
snow
bringing
you
meals
that
you
scorn
oh
yes
you
scorn
them
what
did
you
do
to
the
basket
tonight
look
at
it
lying
there
neglected
in
a
corner
with
p
perfectly
good
ham
and
stewed
fruit
in
it
all
of
a
sudden
i
felt
terrible
about
the
way
they
had
treated
the
basket
and
i
sat
down
on
the
steps
and
began
to
cry
i
remember
that
and
dick
sitting
down
beside
me
and
putting
his
arm
around
me
and
calling
me
good
old
minnie
and
for
heaven
sake
not
to
cry
so
loud
but
i
was
past
caring
i
had
a
sort
of
recollection
of
his
getting
me
to
stand
up
and
our
walking
through
about
miles
of
snow
to
the
when
we
got
there
he
stood
off
in
the
twilight
and
looked
at
me
i
sorry
minnie
he
said
i
never
dreamed
it
would
do
that
do
what
nothing
you
sure
you
wo
forget
i
never
forget
i
said
i
had
got
up
the
steps
by
this
time
and
was
trying
to
figure
why
the
door
had
two
knobs
i
had
any
idea
what
he
meant
remember
he
said
very
slowly
thoburn
is
going
to
have
his
party
instead
of
tell
pierce
that
not
i
was
pretty
well
ashamed
when
i
got
in
the
and
sat
down
in
the
dark
i
kept
saying
over
and
over
to
myself
so
i
not
forget
tonight
not
but
i
could
remember
what
was
to
be
i
was
sleepy
too
and
my
legs
were
cold
and
numb
i
remember
going
into
the
pantry
for
a
steamer
rug
and
sitting
down
there
for
a
minute
with
the
rug
around
my
knees
before
i
started
to
the
house
and
that
is
all
i
do
remember
i
was
wakened
by
a
terrible
hammering
in
the
top
of
my
head
i
reached
out
for
the
glass
of
water
that
i
always
put
beside
my
bed
at
night
and
i
touched
a
instead
then
i
realized
that
the
knocking
all
in
my
head
there
was
a
sort
of
steady
movement
of
feet
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
with
people
talking
and
laughing
and
above
it
all
rose
the
steady
knock
knock
of
somebody
beating
on
tin
ca
do
it
it
was
the
bishop
voice
i
am
convinced
that
nothing
but
dynamite
will
open
this
tin
of
lobster
just
a
moment
bishop
thoburn
voice
and
the
clink
of
bottles
i
have
a
can
opener
somewhere
you
find
the
sauce
a
la
newburg
here
somebody
a
glass
quick
a
bottle
broken
did
anybody
remember
to
bring
salt
and
pepper
dear
mr
thoburn
it
sounded
like
miss
cobb
think
of
thinking
of
all
this
the
credit
is
not
mine
dear
lady
thoburn
said
where
the
deuce
is
that
corkscrew
no
dear
lady
man
makes
his
own
destiny
but
his
birth
date
remains
beyond
his
control
ladies
and
gentlemen
somebody
said
to
thoburn
birthday
being
beyond
his
control
there
was
the
clink
of
glasses
but
i
had
remembered
what
it
had
been
that
i
was
to
remember
and
now
it
was
too
late
i
was
trapped
in
the
pantry
of
my
and
pierce
was
probably
asleep
i
clutched
my
aching
head
and
tried
to
think
i
was
roused
by
hearing
somebody
say
that
miss
jennings
had
no
glass
and
by
steps
nearing
the
pantry
i
had
just
time
to
slip
the
bolt
pantry
locked
said
a
voice
drat
that
minnie
somebody
else
said
the
girl
a
nuisance
hush
miss
summers
said
she
probably
in
there
now
taking
down
what
we
say
and
what
we
eat
convicting
us
out
of
our
own
mouths
i
held
my
breath
and
the
knob
rattled
then
they
found
a
glass
for
miss
patty
and
forgot
the
pantry
under
cover
of
the
next
burst
of
noises
i
tried
the
pantry
window
but
it
was
frozen
shut
nothing
but
a
hammer
would
have
loosened
it
i
began
to
dig
at
it
with
a
wire
hairpin
but
i
had
much
hope
the
fun
in
the
was
getting
fast
and
furious
miss
summers
was
leaning
against
the
pantry
door
and
i
judged
that
most
of
the
men
in
the
room
were
around
her
as
usual
i
put
my
ear
to
the
panel
of
the
door
and
i
could
pretty
nearly
see
what
was
going
on
they
were
toasting
thoburn
and
getting
hungrier
every
minute
as
the
supper
was
put
out
on
the
to
the
bottle
somebody
said
in
infancy
the
milk
bottle
in
our
prime
the
wine
bottle
in
our
dotage
the
pill
bottle
von
inwald
came
over
and
stood
beside
miss
summers
and
i
could
hear
every
whisper
i
have
good
news
for
you
she
said
in
an
undertone
oh
and
what
sh
you
may
recall
she
said
the
series
of
notes
letters
epistles
with
which
you
have
been
honoring
me
lately
how
could
i
forget
they
were
written
in
my
heart
blood
indeed
her
voice
lifted
its
eyebrows
so
to
speak
well
somebody
got
in
my
room
last
night
and
stole
i
dare
say
a
pint
of
your
blood
they
gone
he
was
pretty
well
upset
as
he
might
be
and
she
stood
by
and
listened
to
the
things
he
said
which
if
they
were
as
bad
in
english
as
they
sounded
in
german
i
would
like
to
write
down
and
when
he
cooled
down
and
condensed
as
you
may
say
into
english
he
said
miss
jennings
must
have
seen
the
letters
for
she
would
hardly
speak
to
him
and
miss
summers
said
she
hoped
miss
jennings
had
she
was
too
nice
a
girl
to
treat
shamefully
and
after
he
had
left
her
there
alone
i
heard
a
sort
of
scratching
on
the
door
behind
miss
summers
back
and
then
something
being
shoved
under
the
door
i
stooped
down
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
key
i
struck
a
match
and
i
saw
by
the
tag
that
it
was
the
one
to
the
old
doctor
rooms
i
knew
right
off
what
it
meant
pierce
had
gone
to
bed
or
pretended
to
throw
them
off
the
track
and
thoburn
had
locked
him
in
thoburn
had
taken
any
chances
he
knew
the
influence
pierce
had
over
them
all
and
he
and
his
champagne
and
tin
cans
had
to
get
in
their
work
before
pierce
had
another
chance
at
them
i
had
no
time
to
wonder
how
miss
summers
knew
i
was
in
the
pantry
i
tried
the
window
again
but
it
would
work
somebody
in
the
was
shouting
butter
blue
beans
please
come
to
supper
and
i
could
hear
them
crowding
around
the
tables
i
worked
frantically
with
the
hairpin
and
just
then
two
shadowy
figures
outside
slipped
around
the
corner
of
the
building
it
was
pierce
and
doctor
barnes
i
darted
back
and
put
my
ear
to
the
door
but
they
did
not
come
in
at
once
thoburn
made
a
speech
saying
how
happy
he
was
that
they
were
all
well
and
able
to
go
back
to
civilization
again
where
the
broiled
lobster
flourished
like
a
green
bay
tree
and
the
prune
and
the
cabbage
were
unknown
there
was
loud
applause
and
then
senator
biggs
cleared
his
throat
ladies
and
gentlemen
distinguished
fellow
guests
he
began
i
suggest
a
toast
to
the
autocrat
of
hope
springs
it
is
the
only
blot
on
the
evening
that
owing
to
the
exigencies
of
the
occasion
he
can
not
be
with
us
securely
fastened
in
his
room
he
is
now
sleeping
the
sleep
that
follows
a
stomach
attuned
to
prunes
a
mind
attuned
to
rule
eat
drink
and
be
merry
somebody
said
for
you
diet
there
was
a
swish
and
rustle
as
if
a
woman
got
up
in
a
hurry
do
you
mean
said
miss
patty
clear
voice
that
you
have
dared
to
lock
pier
carter
in
his
room
my
dear
young
lady
several
of
them
began
but
she
did
give
them
time
it
is
outrageous
infamous
she
stormed
i
did
need
to
see
her
to
know
how
she
looked
how
dare
you
suppose
the
building
should
catch
fire
fire
somebody
said
in
a
bewildered
voice
my
dear
young
lady
do
dear
young
lady
me
she
said
angrily
father
bishop
will
you
stand
for
this
why
he
may
jump
out
the
window
and
hurt
himself
give
me
the
key
miss
julia
fingers
were
beating
a
tatoo
behind
her
as
if
she
was
afraid
i
might
miss
it
if
he
jumps
out
he
probably
will
hurt
himself
it
is
impossible
to
release
him
now
miss
jennings
but
if
you
insist
we
can
have
a
mattress
placed
under
the
window
thanks
thoburn
it
wo
be
necessary
the
voice
came
from
the
door
and
a
hush
fell
on
the
party
i
slipped
my
bolt
and
peeped
out
framed
in
the
doorway
was
pierce
with
doctor
barnes
looking
over
his
shoulder
the
people
in
the
were
abject
that
the
only
word
for
it
craven
somebody
suggested
later
and
they
were
that
too
they
smiled
sickly
grins
and
tried
to
be
defiant
and
most
of
them
tried
to
put
down
whatever
they
held
in
their
hands
and
to
look
innocent
if
you
ever
saw
a
boy
when
his
asks
him
what
he
has
in
his
mouth
and
multiply
the
boy
thirty
times
in
number
and
four
times
in
size
know
how
they
looked
pierce
never
smiled
he
would
let
them
speak
a
word
in
defense
or
explanation
he
simply
lined
them
up
as
he
did
at
gym
and
sent
them
one
by
one
to
the
corner
with
whatever
they
had
in
their
hands
he
made
jennings
give
up
a
bottle
of
anchovies
that
he
stuffed
in
his
pocket
and
the
bishop
had
to
come
over
with
a
cheese
and
when
it
was
all
over
he
held
the
door
open
and
they
went
back
to
the
house
they
fairly
ducked
past
him
in
the
doorway
although
he
had
said
a
dozen
words
it
was
a
rout
the
backbone
of
the
rebellion
was
broken
i
knew
that
never
again
would
the
military
discipline
of
hope
springs
be
threatened
thoburn
might
as
well
pack
and
go
it
was
pierce
day
von
inwald
was
almost
the
last
he
stood
by
sneering
with
an
open
bottle
of
olives
in
his
hand
watching
the
others
go
out
pierce
held
the
door
open
and
eyed
him
i
trouble
you
to
put
that
bottle
with
the
others
in
the
corner
pierce
said
sternly
they
stood
glaring
at
each
other
angrily
and
if
i
refuse
you
know
the
rules
here
if
you
refuse
there
is
a
hotel
at
finleyville
von
inwald
glanced
past
pierce
to
where
doctor
barnes
stood
behind
him
with
his
cauliflower
ear
and
his
pugilist
shoulders
then
he
looked
at
the
bottle
in
his
hand
and
from
it
to
miss
patty
standing
haughtily
by
i
have
borne
much
for
you
patricia
he
said
but
i
refuse
to
be
bullied
any
longer
i
shall
go
to
the
hotel
at
finleyville
and
i
shall
take
the
little
olives
with
me
he
smiled
unpleasantly
at
pierce
whose
face
did
not
relax
he
walked
jauntily
to
the
door
and
turned
flourishing
the
bottle
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
he
sneered
raising
the
bottle
in
the
air
standing
jeering
in
the
doorway
he
bowed
to
miss
patty
and
pierce
and
put
an
olive
into
his
mouth
but
instantly
he
made
a
terrible
face
and
clapped
a
hand
just
in
front
of
his
left
ear
he
stood
there
a
moment
his
face
distorted
then
he
darted
into
the
night
and
i
never
saw
him
again
mumps
doctor
barnes
ejaculated
and
stood
staring
after
him
from
the
steps
chapter
xxx
let
good
digestion
there
was
no
one
left
but
miss
patty
as
she
started
out
past
him
with
a
crimson
spot
in
each
cheek
pierce
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
she
hesitated
and
he
closed
the
door
on
doctor
barnes
and
put
his
back
against
it
i
had
just
time
to
slip
back
into
the
pantry
and
shut
myself
in
for
a
minute
there
was
a
sound
then
i
told
you
i
should
come
miss
patty
said
in
her
haughtiest
manner
you
need
not
trouble
to
be
disagreeable
disagreeable
he
repeated
i
am
abject
i
do
understand
she
said
but
you
need
explain
it
really
does
not
matter
it
matters
to
me
i
had
to
do
this
i
promised
you
i
would
make
good
and
if
i
had
let
this
pass
do
you
see
i
could
let
it
go
you
can
let
me
go
now
not
until
i
have
justified
myself
to
you
i
am
not
interested
i
heard
him
take
a
step
or
two
toward
her
i
do
quite
believe
that
he
said
in
a
low
tone
you
were
interested
in
what
i
said
here
this
afternoon
i
did
hear
it
none
of
it
not
not
all
i
spoke
you
remember
about
your
sister
and
about
dick
he
paused
i
could
imagine
her
staring
at
him
in
her
way
you
never
mentioned
them
she
said
scornfully
and
stopped
he
laughed
a
low
laugh
boyish
and
full
of
triumph
ah
he
said
so
you
did
hear
i
going
to
say
it
again
anyhow
i
love
you
patty
i
i
mad
for
you
i
loved
you
hopelessly
for
so
long
that
when
there
a
ray
of
hope
i
i
hardly
sane
i
please
she
said
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
waken
at
night
just
to
say
your
name
over
and
over
and
when
dawn
comes
through
the
windows
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
she
said
wildly
i
am
still
i
welcome
the
daylight
he
went
on
talking
very
fast
because
it
means
another
day
when
i
can
see
you
if
it
sounds
foolish
it
really
lots
worse
than
it
sounds
patty
the
door
opened
just
then
and
doctor
barnes
voice
spoke
from
the
step
i
say
he
complained
you
need
get
out
pierce
said
angrily
and
the
door
slammed
the
interruption
gave
him
time
i
think
to
see
how
far
he
gone
and
his
voice
when
he
spoke
again
was
not
so
hopeful
i
not
pleading
my
cause
he
said
humbly
i
know
i
have
any
cause
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
you
said
this
afternoon
miss
patty
said
softly
that
you
could
offer
me
the
the
kind
of
love
that
a
woman
could
be
proud
of
she
finished
off
with
a
sort
of
gasp
as
if
she
was
shocked
at
herself
i
was
so
excited
that
my
heart
beat
a
tatoo
against
my
ribs
and
without
my
being
conscious
of
it
as
you
may
say
the
pantry
door
opened
about
an
inch
and
i
found
myself
with
an
eye
to
the
crack
they
were
standing
facing
each
other
he
all
flushed
and
eager
and
my
dear
miss
patty
pale
and
trembly
but
she
was
shy
she
was
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
and
her
blessed
lips
were
quivering
how
can
you
care
she
asked
when
he
only
stood
and
looked
at
her
i
been
such
a
such
a
selfish
beast
hush
he
leaned
toward
her
and
i
held
my
breath
you
are
everything
that
is
best
in
the
world
and
i
what
can
i
offer
you
i
have
nothing
not
even
this
sanatorium
no
money
no
title
oh
that
she
interrupted
and
stood
waiting
well
you
you
could
at
least
offer
yourself
patty
she
went
right
over
to
him
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
if
you
wo
she
said
i
offer
myself
instead
his
arms
went
around
her
like
a
flash
at
that
and
he
kissed
her
seen
a
good
many
kisses
in
my
day
the
walk
being
a
sort
of
lover
lane
but
they
were
generally
of
the
variety
this
was
different
he
just
gathered
her
up
to
him
and
held
her
close
and
if
she
was
as
much
thrilled
as
i
was
in
the
pantry
be
ready
to
die
kissing
then
without
releasing
her
he
raised
his
head
with
such
a
look
of
victory
in
his
face
that
i
still
see
it
sometimes
in
my
sleep
and
his
eye
caught
mine
through
the
crack
but
if
i
looked
to
see
him
drop
her
i
was
mistaken
he
drew
her
up
and
kissed
her
again
but
this
time
on
the
forehead
and
when
he
let
her
go
and
she
had
dropped
into
a
chair
and
hid
her
shining
face
against
the
back
as
if
she
was
ashamed
which
she
might
well
be
he
stood
laughing
over
her
bent
head
at
me
come
out
minnie
he
called
come
out
and
hear
the
good
news
hear
i
said
i
seen
all
the
news
i
want
gracious
miss
patty
said
and
buried
her
head
again
but
he
had
reached
the
shameless
stage
a
man
who
is
really
in
love
always
seems
to
get
to
that
point
sooner
or
later
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
back
of
her
neck
and
if
his
hand
shook
when
he
pushed
in
one
of
her
shell
hairpins
it
was
excitement
and
not
fright
i
hardly
realize
it
minnie
he
said
i
do
deserve
her
for
a
minute
certainly
not
i
said
he
does
miss
patty
voice
smothered
then
she
got
up
and
came
over
to
me
there
is
going
to
be
an
awful
fuss
minnie
she
said
think
of
aunt
honoria
and
oskar
let
them
fuss
i
said
grandly
if
the
worst
comes
you
can
spend
your
honeymoon
in
the
i
so
used
to
carrying
meals
there
now
that
it
second
nature
and
at
that
they
both
made
for
me
and
as
pierce
kissed
me
doctor
barnes
opened
the
door
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
queer
and
wild
and
then
he
slammed
the
door
and
we
heard
him
stamping
down
the
steps
pierce
had
to
bring
him
back
well
that
all
there
is
to
it
the
place
filled
up
and
stayed
filled
but
not
under
pierce
jennings
said
ability
of
his
kind
was
wasted
there
once
the
place
was
running
and
set
him
to
building
a
railroad
somewhere
or
other
with
him
and
miss
patty
living
in
a
private
car
and
he
carrying
a
portable
telephone
with
him
so
he
can
talk
to
her
every
hour
or
so
dick
and
his
wife
are
running
the
sanatorium
or
think
they
are
doctor
barnes
is
the
whole
place
really
jennings
was
so
glad
to
have
miss
patty
give
up
the
prince
and
send
him
back
home
after
he
been
a
week
in
the
hotel
at
finleyville
looking
as
if
his
face
would
collapse
if
you
stuck
a
pin
in
it
jennings
was
so
happy
not
to
mention
having
worked
off
his
gout
at
the
that
he
forgave
the
dickys
without
any
trouble
and
even
went
out
and
had
a
meal
with
them
in
the
before
they
moved
in
with
dick
making
the
coffee
i
miss
the
spring
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
it
is
hard
to
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks
but
with
miss
patty
happy
and
with
doctor
barnes
around
thoburn
came
out
the
afternoon

after

waistcoat

confessed

pounds
and
the
dream
of

said
and
threw
his
chest
out

and
at
that
he
came
over
to
me
