spencer
chambers
frowned
at
the
spacegram
on
the
desk
before
him
john
moore
mallory
that
was
the
man
who
had
caused
so
much
trouble
in
the
jovian
elections
the
troublemaker
who
had
shouted
for
an
investigation
of
interplanetary
power
the
man
who
had
said
that
spencer
chambers
and
interplanetary
power
were
waging
economic
war
against
the
people
of
the
solar
system
chambers
smiled
with
long
fingers
he
rubbed
his
mustache
john
moore
mallory
was
right
for
that
reason
he
was
a
dangerous
man
prison
was
the
place
for
him
but
probably
a
prison
outside
the
jovian
confederacy
perhaps
one
of
the
prison
ships
that
plied
to
the
edge
of
the
system
clear
to
the
orbit
of
pluto
or
would
the
prison
on
mercury
be
better
spencer
chambers
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
matched
his
fingertips
staring
at
them
frowning
again
mercury
was
a
hard
place
a
man
life
was
worth
much
there
working
in
the
power
plants
where
the
sun
poured
out
its
flaming
blast
of
heat
and
radiations
sucked
the
energy
from
one
body
in
six
months
a
year
at
most
any
man
was
finished
chambers
shook
his
head
not
mercury
he
had
nothing
against
mallory
he
had
never
met
the
man
but
he
rather
liked
him
mallory
was
just
a
man
fighting
for
a
principle
the
same
as
chambers
was
doing
he
was
sorry
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
put
mallory
in
prison
if
the
man
only
had
listened
to
reason
had
accepted
the
proposals
that
had
been
made
or
just
had
dropped
out
of
sight
until
the
jovian
elections
were
over
or
at
least
had
moderated
his
charges
but
when
he
had
attempted
to
reveal
the
offers
which
he
termed
bribery
something
had
to
be
done
ludwig
stutsman
had
handled
that
part
of
it
brilliant
fellow
this
stutsman
but
as
mean
a
human
as
ever
walked
on
two
legs
a
man
utterly
without
mercy
entirely
without
principle
a
man
who
would
stoop
to
any
depth
but
a
useful
man
a
good
one
to
have
around
to
do
the
dirty
work
and
dirty
work
sometimes
was
necessary
chambers
picked
up
the
spacegram
again
and
studied
it
stutsman
out
on
callisto
now
had
sent
it
he
was
doing
a
good
job
out
there
the
jovian
confederacy
less
than
one
earth
year
under
interplanetary
domination
was
still
half
rebellious
still
angry
at
being
forced
to
turn
over
its
government
to
the
officials
of
chambers
company
an
iron
heel
was
needed
and
stutsman
was
that
iron
heel
so
the
people
on
the
jovian
satellites
wanted
the
release
of
john
moore
mallory
they
getting
ugly
the
spacegram
said
it
had
been
a
mistake
to
confine
mallory
to
callisto
stutsman
should
have
thought
of
that
chambers
would
instruct
stutsman
to
remove
mallory
from
the
callisto
prison
place
him
on
one
of
the
prison
ships
give
instructions
to
the
captain
to
make
things
comfortable
for
him
when
this
furor
had
blown
over
after
things
had
quieted
down
in
the
jovian
confederacy
it
might
be
possible
to
release
mallory
after
all
the
man
was
really
guilty
of
any
crime
it
was
a
shame
that
he
should
be
imprisoned
when
racketeering
rats
like
scorio
went
right
here
in
new
york
a
buzzer
purred
softly
and
chambers
reached
out
to
press
a
stud
craven
to
see
you
his
secretary
said
you
asked
to
see
him
mr
chambers
all
right
said
chambers
send
him
right
in
he
clicked
the
stud
again
picked
up
his
pen
wrote
out
a
spacegram
to
stutsman
and
signed
it
herbert
craven
stood
just
inside
the
door
his
black
suit
wrinkled
and
untidy
his
sparse
sandy
hair
standing
on
end
you
sent
for
me
he
said
sourly
sit
down
doctor
invited
chambers
craven
sat
down
he
peered
at
chambers
through
glasses
i
have
much
time
he
declared
acidly
cigar
chambers
offered
never
smoke
a
drink
then
you
know
i
do
drink
snapped
craven
doctor
said
chambers
you
the
least
sociable
man
i
ever
known
what
do
you
do
to
enjoy
yourself
i
work
said
craven
i
find
it
interesting
you
must
you
even
begrudge
the
time
it
takes
to
talk
with
me
i
wo
deny
it
what
do
you
want
this
time
chambers
swung
about
to
face
him
squarely
across
the
desk
there
was
a
cold
look
in
the
financier
gray
eyes
and
his
lips
were
grim
craven
he
said
i
do
trust
you
i
never
trusted
you
probably
that
no
news
to
you
you
do
trust
anyone
countered
craven
you
watching
everybody
all
the
time
you
sold
me
a
gadget
i
did
need
five
years
ago
said
chambers
you
outfoxed
me
and
i
do
hold
it
against
you
in
fact
it
almost
made
me
admire
you
because
of
that
i
put
you
under
a
contract
one
that
you
and
all
the
lawyers
in
hell
ca
break
because
someday
you
find
something
valuable
and
when
you
do
i
want
it
a
million
a
year
is
a
high
price
to
pay
to
protect
myself
against
you
but
i
think
it
worth
it
if
i
did
think
so
i
have
turned
you
over
to
stutsman
long
ago
stutsman
knows
how
to
handle
men
like
you
you
mean
said
craven
that
you
found
i
working
on
something
i
have
reported
to
you
that
exactly
it
you
get
a
report
when
i
have
something
to
report
not
before
that
all
right
said
chambers
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
craven
got
to
his
feet
slowly
these
talks
with
you
are
so
refreshing
he
remarked
we
have
to
have
them
oftener
said
chambers
craven
banged
the
door
as
he
went
out
chambers
stared
after
him
a
queer
man
the
most
astute
scientific
mind
anywhere
but
not
a
man
to
be
trusted
the
president
of
interplanetary
power
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
to
the
window
below
spread
the
roaring
inferno
of
new
york
greatest
city
in
the
solar
system
a
strange
place
of
queer
beauty
and
weighty
materialism
dreamlike
in
its
construction
but
utilitarian
in
its
purpose
for
it
was
a
port
of
many
planets
the
afternoon
sunlight
slanted
through
the
window
softening
the
hair
of
the
man
who
stood
there
his
shoulders
almost
blocked
the
window
for
he
had
the
body
of
a
fighting
man
one
moreover
in
good
condition
his
mustache
rode
with
an
air
of
dignity
above
his
thin
rugged
mouth
his
eyes
looked
out
on
the
city
but
did
not
see
it
through
his
brain
went
the
vision
of
a
dream
that
was
coming
true
his
dream
spun
its
fragile
net
about
the
planets
of
the
solar
system
about
their
moons
about
every
single
foot
of
planetary
ground
where
men
had
gone
to
build
and
create
a
second
homeland
the
mines
of
mercury
and
the
farms
of
venus
the
of
mars
and
the
mighty
domed
cities
on
the
moons
of
jupiter
the
moons
of
saturn
and
the
great
cold
laboratories
of
pluto
power
was
the
key
supplied
by
the
accumulators
owned
and
rented
by
interplanetary
power
a
monopoly
of
power
power
that
venus
and
mercury
had
too
much
of
must
sell
on
the
market
and
that
the
other
planets
and
satellites
needed
power
to
drive
huge
spaceships
across
the
void
to
turn
the
wheels
of
industry
to
heat
the
domes
on
colder
worlds
power
to
make
possible
the
life
and
functioning
of
mankind
on
hostile
worlds
in
the
great
power
plants
of
mercury
and
venus
the
accumulators
were
charged
and
then
shipped
out
to
those
other
worlds
where
power
was
needed
accumulators
were
rented
never
sold
because
they
belonged
at
all
times
to
interplanetary
power
they
literally
held
the
fate
of
all
the
planets
in
their
cells
a
few
accumulators
were
manufactured
and
sold
by
other
smaller
companies
but
they
were
few
and
the
price
was
high
interplanetary
saw
to
that
when
the
cry
of
monopoly
was
raised
interplanetary
could
point
to
these
other
manufacturers
as
proof
that
there
was
no
restraint
of
trade
under
the
statute
no
monopoly
could
be
charged
but
the
cost
of
manufacturing
accumulators
alone
was
protection
against
serious
competition
from
anyone
upon
a
satisfactory
efficient
device
rested
the
success
or
failure
of
space
travel
itself
that
device
and
the
power
it
stored
were
for
sale
by
interplanetary
and
to
all
practical
purposes
by
interplanetary
only
accordingly
year
after
year
interplanetary
had
tightened
its
grip
upon
the
solar
system
mercury
was
virtually
owned
by
the
company
mars
and
venus
were
little
more
than
puppet
states
and
now
the
government
of
the
jovian
confederacy
was
in
the
hands
of
men
who
acknowledged
spencer
chambers
as
their
master
on
earth
the
agents
and
the
lobbyists
representing
interplanetary
swarmed
in
every
capital
even
in
the
capital
of
the
central
european
federation
whose
people
were
dominated
by
an
absolute
dictatorship
for
even
central
europe
needed
accumulators
economic
dictatorship
said
spencer
chambers
to
himself
that
what
john
moore
mallory
called
it
well
why
not
such
a
dictatorship
would
insure
the
best
business
brains
at
the
heads
of
the
governments
would
give
the
solar
system
a
business
administration
would
guard
against
the
mistakes
of
popular
government
democracies
were
based
on
a
false
presumption
the
theory
that
all
people
were
fit
to
rule
it
granted
intelligence
where
there
was
no
intelligence
it
presumed
ability
where
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
any
it
gave
the
idiot
the
same
political
standing
as
the
wise
man
the
crackpot
the
same
political
opportunity
as
the
man
of
common
sense
the
weakling
the
same
voice
as
the
strong
man
it
was
government
by
emotion
rather
than
by
judgment
spencer
chambers
face
took
on
stern
lines
there
was
no
softness
left
now
the
late
afternoon
sunlight
painted
angles
and
threw
shadows
and
created
highlights
that
made
him
look
almost
like
a
granite
mask
on
a
solid
granite
body
there
was
no
room
for
mallory
nonsense
in
a
dynamic
expanding
civilization
no
reason
to
kill
him
even
he
might
have
value
under
certain
circumstances
and
no
really
efficient
executive
destroys
value
but
he
had
to
be
out
of
the
way
where
his
tongue
could
do
no
damage
the
damned
fool
what
good
would
his
idiotic
idealism
do
him
on
a
prison
spaceship
russell
page
squinted
thoughtful
eyes
at
the
thing
he
had
created
a
transparent
cloud
a
visible
sharply
outlined
cloud
of
it
was
visible
as
a
piece
of
glass
is
visible
as
a
globe
of
water
is
visible
there
it
lay
within
his
apparatus
a
thing
that
should
be
i
believe
we
have
something
there
harry
he
said
slowly
harry
wilson
sucked
at
the
cigarette
that
drooped
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
blew
twin
streams
of
smoke
from
his
nostrils
his
eyes
twitched
nervously
yeah
he
said
all
of
that
said
russell
page
perhaps
a
whole
lot
more
it
stops
all
energy
change
said
wilson
as
if
time
stood
still
and
things
remained
exactly
as
they
were
when
time
had
stopped
it
more
than
that
page
declared
it
conserves
not
only
energy
not
only
the
energy
of
the
whole
but
the
energy
of
the
part
it
is
perfectly
transparent
yet
it
has
refractive
qualities
it
absorb
light
because
to
do
so
would
change
its
energy
content
in
that
field
whatever
is
hot
stays
hot
whatever
is
cold
ca
gain
heat
he
scraped
his
hand
over
a
week
growth
of
beard
considering
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
pipe
and
a
leather
pouch
thoughtfully
he
filled
the
pipe
and
lit
it
it
had
started
with
his
experiments
in
force
field
an
experiment
to
observe
the
effects
of
heating
a
conductor
in
that
field
it
had
been
impossible
to
heat
the
conductor
electrically
for
that
would
have
upset
the
field
changed
it
twisted
it
into
something
else
so
he
had
used
a
bunsen
burner
through
eyes
he
still
could
see
that
slender
strand
of
imperm
wire
how
its
silvery
length
had
turned
to
red
under
the
blue
flame
deep
red
at
first
and
then
brighter
until
it
flamed
in
almost
incandescence
and
all
the
while
the
humming
of
the
transformer
as
the
force
field
built
up
the
humming
of
the
transformer
and
the
muted
roaring
of
the
burner
and
the
glowing
heat
in
the
length
of
wire
something
had
happened
then
an
awesome
something
a
weird
wrench
as
if
some
greater
power
some
greater
law
had
taken
hold
a
glove
of
force
invisible
but
somehow
sensed
had
closed
about
the
wire
and
flame
instantly
the
roaring
of
the
burner
changed
in
tone
an
odor
of
gas
spewed
out
of
the
vents
at
its
base
something
had
cut
off
the
flow
of
flame
in
the
brass
tube
some
force
the
flame
was
a
transparent
cloud
the
blue
and
red
of
flame
and
hot
wire
had
changed
in
the
whiplash
of
a
second
to
a
refractive
but
transparent
cloud
that
hung
there
within
the
apparatus
the
red
color
had
vanished
from
the
wire
as
the
blue
had
vanished
from
the
flame
the
wire
was
shining
it
was
silvery
it
was
white
there
was
no
hint
of
color
just
a
refractive
blur
that
told
him
the
wire
was
there
colorless
reflection
that
meant
perfect
reflection
the
most
perfect
reflectors
reflect
little
more
than
per
cent
of
the
light
incident
and
the
absorption
of
the
two
per
cent
colors
those
reflectors
as
copper
or
gold
or
chromium
but
the
imperm
wire
within
that
force
field
that
had
been
flame
a
moment
before
was
reflecting
light
he
had
cut
the
wire
with
a
pair
of
shears
and
it
had
still
hung
unsupported
in
the
air
unchanging
within
the
shimmer
that
constituted
something
no
man
had
ever
seen
before
you
ca
put
energy
in
said
page
talking
to
himself
chewing
the
bit
of
his
pipe
you
ca
take
energy
out
it
still
as
hot
as
it
was
at
the
moment
the
change
came
but
it
ca
radiate
any
of
that
heat
it
ca
radiate
any
kind
of
energy
why
even
the
wire
was
reflective
so
that
it
could
absorb
energy
and
thus
disturb
the
balance
that
existed
within
that
bit
of
space
not
only
energy
itself
was
preserved
but
the
very
form
of
energy
but
why
that
was
the
question
that
hammered
at
him
why
before
he
could
go
ahead
he
had
to
know
why
perhaps
the
verging
of
the
field
toward
field
somewhere
in
between
those
two
fields
of
force
somewhere
within
that
almost
borderline
which
separated
them
he
might
find
the
secret
rising
to
his
feet
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
harry
he
announced
we
have
work
to
do
smoke
drooled
from
wilson
nostrils
yeah
he
said
page
had
a
sudden
urge
to
lash
out
and
hit
the
man
that
eternal
drooling
of
smoke
out
of
his
nostrils
that
everlasting
cigarette
dangling
limply
from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
the
shifty
eyes
the
dirty
fingernails
got
on
his
nerves
but
wilson
was
a
mechanical
genius
his
hands
were
clever
despite
the
dirty
nails
they
could
fashion
pinhead
cameras
and
electroscopes
or
balances
capable
of
measuring
the
pressure
of
electronic
impacts
as
a
laboratory
assistant
he
was
unbeatable
if
only
he
would
answer
every
statement
or
question
with
that
page
stopped
in
front
of
a
smaller
room
enclosed
by
heavy
quartz
inside
that
room
was
the
great
bank
of
rectifiers
from
them
lashed
a
glare
that
splashed
against
his
face
and
shoulders
painting
him
in
angry
garish
color
the
glass
guarded
him
from
the
terrific
blast
of
light
that
flared
from
the
pool
of
shimmering
molten
metal
a
terrible
emanation
that
would
have
flayed
a
man
skin
from
his
body
within
the
space
of
seconds
the
scientist
squinted
his
eyes
against
the
glare
there
was
something
in
it
that
caught
him
with
a
deadly
fascination
the
personification
of
power
the
incredibly
intense
spot
of
incandescent
vapor
the
tiny
sphere
of
fire
the
spinning
surge
of
that
shining
pool
the
intense
glare
of
ionization
power
the
breath
of
modern
mankind
the
pulse
of
progress
in
an
adjacent
room
were
the
accumulators
not
interplanetary
accumulators
which
he
would
have
had
to
rent
but
ones
he
had
bought
from
a
small
manufacturer
who
turned
out
only
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
a
year
not
enough
to
bother
interplanetary
gregory
manning
had
made
it
possible
for
him
to
buy
those
accumulators
manning
had
made
many
things
possible
in
this
little
laboratory
hidden
deep
within
the
heart
of
the
sierras
many
miles
from
any
other
habitation
manning
grandfather
jackson
manning
had
first
generated
the
curvature
field
and
overcome
gravity
had
left
his
grandson
a
fortune
that
approached
the
mark
but
that
had
not
been
all
from
his
famous
ancestor
manning
had
inherited
a
keen
sharp
scientific
mind
from
his
mother
father
anthony
barret
he
had
gained
an
astute
business
sense
but
unlike
his
maternal
grandfather
he
had
not
turned
his
attention
entirely
to
business
old
man
barret
had
virtually
ruled
wall
street
for
almost
a
generation
had
become
a
financial
myth
linked
with
keen
business
sense
with
an
uncanny
ability
to
handle
men
and
money
but
his
grandson
gregory
manning
had
become
known
to
the
world
in
a
different
way
for
while
he
had
inherited
scientific
ability
from
one
side
of
the
family
financial
sense
from
the
other
he
likewise
had
inherited
from
some
other
ancestor
perhaps
remote
and
unknown
a
wanderlust
that
had
taken
him
to
the
farthest
outposts
of
the
solar
system
it
was
gregory
manning
who
had
financed
and
headed
the
rescue
expedition
which
took
the
first
pluto
flight
off
that
dark
icebox
of
a
world
when
the
exploration
ship
had
crashed
it
was
he
who
had
piloted
home
the
winning
ship
in
the
jupiter
derby
sending
his
bulleting
craft
screaming
around
the
mighty
planet
in
a
time
which
set
a
solar
record
it
was
gregory
manning
who
had
entered
the
venusian
swamps
and
brought
back
alive
the
mystery
lizard
that
had
been
reported
there
and
he
was
the
one
who
had
flown
the
serum
to
mercury
when
the
lives
of
ten
thousand
men
depended
upon
the
thrumming
engines
that
drove
the
shining
ship
inward
toward
the
sun
russell
page
had
known
him
since
college
days
they
had
worked
out
their
experiments
together
in
the
school
laboratories
had
spent
long
hours
arguing
and
wondering
debating
scientific
theories
both
had
loved
the
same
girl
both
had
lost
her
and
together
they
had
been
bitter
over
it
drowning
their
bitterness
in
a
drunk
that
made
campus
history
after
graduation
gregory
manning
had
gone
on
to
world
fame
had
roamed
over
the
face
of
every
planet
except
jupiter
and
saturn
had
visited
every
inhabited
moon
had
climbed
lunar
mountains
penetrated
venusian
swamps
crossed
martian
deserts
driven
by
a
need
to
see
and
experience
that
would
not
let
him
rest
russell
page
had
sunk
into
obscurity
had
buried
himself
in
scientific
research
coming
more
and
more
to
aim
his
effort
at
the
discovery
of
a
new
source
of
power
power
that
would
be
cheap
that
would
destroy
the
threat
of
interplanetary
dictatorship
page
turned
away
from
the
rectifier
room
maybe
i
have
something
to
show
greg
soon
he
told
himself
maybe
after
all
these
years
forty
minutes
after
page
put
through
the
call
to
chicago
gregory
manning
arrived
the
scientist
watching
for
him
from
the
tiny
lawn
that
surrounded
the
combined
home
and
laboratory
saw
his
plane
bullet
into
sight
scream
down
toward
the
little
field
and
make
a
perfect
landing
hurrying
toward
the
plane
as
gregory
stepped
out
of
it
russell
noted
that
his
friend
looked
the
same
as
ever
though
it
had
been
a
year
or
more
since
he
had
seen
him
the
thing
that
was
discomfiting
about
greg
was
his
apparently
enduring
youthfulness
he
was
clad
in
jodhpurs
and
boots
and
an
old
tweed
coat
with
a
brilliant
blue
stock
at
his
throat
he
waved
a
hand
in
greeting
and
hurried
forward
russ
heard
the
grating
of
his
boots
across
the
gravel
of
the
walk
greg
face
was
bleak
it
always
was
a
clean
smooth
face
hard
with
something
stern
about
the
eyes
his
grip
almost
crushed
russ
hand
but
his
tone
was
crisp
you
sounded
excited
russ
i
have
a
right
to
be
said
the
scientist
i
think
i
have
found
something
at
last
atomic
power
asked
manning
there
was
no
flutter
of
excitement
in
his
voice
just
a
little
hardening
of
the
lines
about
his
eyes
a
little
tensing
of
the
muscles
in
his
cheeks
russ
shook
his
head
not
atomic
energy
if
it
anything
it
material
energy
the
secret
of
the
energy
of
matter
they
halted
before
two
lawn
chairs
let
sit
down
here
invited
russ
i
can
tell
it
to
you
out
here
show
it
to
you
afterward
it
is
often
i
can
be
outdoors
it
is
a
fine
place
said
greg
i
can
smell
the
pines
the
laboratory
perched
on
a
ledge
of
rugged
rock
nearly
feet
above
sea
level
before
them
the
land
swept
down
in
jagged
ruggedness
to
a
valley
far
below
where
a
stream
flashed
in
the
noonday
sun
beyond
climbed
slopes
and
far
in
the
distance
gleamed
shimmering
spires
of
peaks
from
his
leather
jacket
russ
hauled
forth
his
pipe
and
tobacco
lighted
up
it
was
this
way
he
said
leaning
back
comfortably
he
outlined
the
first
experiment
manning
listened
intently
now
comes
the
funny
part
russ
added
i
had
hopes
before
but
i
believe
this
is
what
put
me
on
the
right
track
i
took
a
metal
rod
a
welding
rod
you
know
i
pushed
it
into
that
solidified
force
field
if
that
is
what
you
call
it
although
that
does
describe
it
the
rod
went
in
took
a
lot
of
pushing
but
it
went
in
and
though
the
field
seemed
entirely
transparent
you
could
see
the
rod
even
after
i
had
pushed
enough
of
it
in
so
it
should
have
come
out
the
other
side
it
was
as
if
it
had
entered
the
sphere
of
force
at
all
as
if
i
were
just
telescoping
the
rod
and
its
density
were
increasing
as
i
pushed
like
pushing
it
back
into
itself
but
that
of
course
would
have
been
possible
he
paused
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
snowy
peaks
far
in
the
purple
distance
manning
waited
finally
the
rod
came
out
russ
went
on
mind
you
it
came
out
even
after
i
would
have
sworn
if
i
had
relied
alone
upon
my
eyes
that
it
had
entered
the
sphere
at
all
it
came
out
ninety
degrees
removed
from
its
point
of
entry
wait
a
second
said
manning
this
does
check
did
you
do
it
more
than
once
i
did
it
a
dozen
times
and
the
results
were
the
same
each
time
but
you
have
heard
the
half
of
it
when
i
pulled
that
rod
out
yes
i
could
pull
it
out
it
was
a
good
two
inches
shorter
than
when
i
had
pushed
it
in
i
could
believe
that
part
of
it
it
was
even
harder
to
believe
than
that
the
rod
should
come
out
ninety
degrees
from
its
point
of
entry
i
measured
the
rods
after
that
and
made
sure
kept
an
accurate
record
every
single
one
of
them
lost
approximately
two
inches
by
being
shoved
into
the
sphere
every
single
one
of
them
repeated
the
phenomenon
of
curving
within
the
sphere
to
come
out
somewhere
else
than
where
i
had
inserted
them
any
explanation
of
it
asked
manning
and
now
there
was
a
cold
chill
of
excitement
in
his
voice
theories
no
real
explanations
remember
that
you
ca
see
the
rod
after
you
push
it
into
the
sphere
it
just
as
if
it
is
there
well
maybe
it
is
you
ca
disturb
anything
within
that
sphere
or
you
change
the
sum
of
energies
within
it
the
sphere
seems
dedicated
to
that
one
thing
it
can
not
change
if
the
rod
struck
the
imperm
wire
within
the
field
it
would
press
the
wire
down
would
use
up
energy
decrease
the
potential
energy
so
the
rod
simply
had
to
miss
it
somehow
i
believe
it
into
some
higher
plane
of
existence
and
went
and
in
doing
that
it
had
to
turn
so
many
corners
so
many
corners
that
the
length
was
used
up
or
maybe
it
was
increased
in
density
i
not
sure
perhaps
no
one
will
ever
know
why
did
you
tell
me
about
this
sooner
demanded
manning
i
should
have
been
out
here
helping
you
maybe
i
would
be
much
good
but
i
might
have
helped
you
have
your
chance
russ
told
him
we
just
starting
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
had
something
before
i
troubled
you
i
tried
other
things
with
that
first
sphere
i
found
that
metal
pushed
through
the
sphere
will
conduct
an
electrical
current
which
is
pretty
definite
proof
that
the
metal
is
within
the
sphere
at
all
glass
can
be
forced
through
it
without
breaking
not
flexible
glass
but
rods
of
plain
old
brittle
glass
it
turns
without
breaking
and
it
also
loses
some
of
its
length
water
can
be
forced
through
a
tube
inserted
in
the
sphere
but
only
when
terrific
pressure
is
applied
what
that
proves
i
ca
even
begin
to
guess
you
said
you
experimented
on
the
first
sphere
said
manning
have
you
made
others
russ
rose
from
his
chair
come
on
in
greg
he
said
and
there
was
a
grin
on
his
face
i
have
something
you
have
to
see
to
appreciate
the
apparatus
was
heavier
and
larger
than
the
first
in
which
russ
had
created
the
sphere
of
energy
fed
by
a
powerful
accumulator
battery
five
power
leads
were
aimed
at
it
centered
in
the
space
between
four
great
copper
blocks
russ
hand
went
out
to
the
switch
that
controlled
the
power
suddenly
the
power
beams
flamed
changed
from
a
dull
glow
into
an
intense
almost
intolerable
brilliance
a
dull
grumble
of
power
climbed
up
to
a
steady
wail
the
beams
had
changed
color
were
bluish
now
the
typical
color
of
ionized
air
they
were
just
power
beams
meeting
at
a
common
center
but
somehow
they
were
queer
too
for
though
they
were
capable
of
slashing
far
out
into
space
they
were
stopped
dead
their
might
was
pouring
into
a
common
center
and
going
no
farther
a
splash
of
intensely
glowing
light
rested
over
them
then
began
to
rotate
slowly
as
a
motor
somewhere
hummed
softly
cutting
through
the
mad
roar
and
rumble
of
power
that
surged
through
the
laboratory
the
glowing
light
was
spinning
more
swiftly
now
a
rotating
field
was
being
established
the
power
beams
began
to
wink
falling
and
rising
in
intensity
the
sphere
seemed
to
grow
almost
filling
the
space
between
the
copper
blocks
it
touched
one
and
rebounded
slightly
toward
another
it
extended
increased
slightly
a
terrible
screaming
ripped
through
the
room
drowning
out
the
titanic
din
as
the
spinning
sphere
came
in
contact
with
the
copper
blocks
as
force
and
metal
resulted
in
weird
friction
with
a
shocking
wrench
the
beams
went
dead
the
scream
cut
off
the
roar
was
gone
a
terrifying
silence
fell
upon
the
room
as
soon
as
the
suddenly
thunking
relays
opened
automatically
the
sphere
was
gone
in
its
place
was
a
tenuous
refraction
that
told
where
it
had
been
that
and
a
thin
layer
of
perfectly
reflective
copper
colorless
now
but
manning
knew
it
was
copper
for
it
represented
the
continuation
of
the
great
copper
blocks
his
mind
felt
as
if
it
were
racing
in
neutral
getting
nowhere
within
that
sphere
was
the
total
energy
that
had
been
poured
out
by
five
gigantic
beams
turned
on
full
for
almost
a
minute
time
compressed
energy
energy
enough
to
blast
these
mountains
down
to
the
primal
rock
were
it
released
instantly
energy
trapped
and
held
by
virtue
of
some
peculiarity
of
that
little
borderline
between
force
fields
and
russ
walked
across
the
room
to
a
small
electric
truck
with
rubber
caterpillar
treads
driven
by
a
bank
of
portable
accumulators
skillfully
the
scientist
maneuvered
it
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
picked
up
a
steel
bar
four
inches
in
diameter
and
five
feet
long
holding
it
by
the
handler
magnetic
crane
he
fixed
it
firmly
in
the
armlike
jaws
on
the
front
of
the
machine
then
moved
the
machine
into
a
position
straddling
the
sphere
of
force
with
smashing
momentum
the
iron
jaws
thrust
downward
driving
the
steel
bar
into
the
sphere
there
was
a
groaning
crash
as
the
handler
came
to
a
halt
shuddering
with
only
eight
inches
of
the
bar
buried
in
the
sphere
the
stench
of
hot
insulation
filled
the
room
while
the
electric
motor
throbbed
the
rubber
treads
creaked
the
machine
groaned
and
strained
but
the
bar
would
go
no
farther
russ
shut
off
the
machine
and
stood
back
that
gives
you
an
idea
he
said
grimly
the
trick
now
greg
said
is
to
break
down
the
field
without
a
word
russ
reached
for
the
power
controls
a
sudden
roar
of
thunderous
fury
and
the
beams
leaped
at
the
sphere
but
this
time
the
sphere
did
not
materialize
again
again
the
wrench
shuddered
through
the
laboratory
a
wrench
that
seemed
to
distort
space
and
time
then
as
abruptly
as
it
had
come
it
was
gone
but
when
it
ended
something
gigantic
and
incomprehensibly
powerful
seemed
to
rush
soundlessly
by
something
that
was
felt
and
sensed
it
was
like
a
great
noiseless
breathless
wind
in
the
dead
of
night
that
rushed
by
them
and
through
them
all
about
them
in
space
and
died
slowly
away
but
the
vanished
steel
did
not
reappear
with
the
disappearance
of
the
sphere
and
the
draining
away
of
power
almost
grotesquely
now
the
handler
stood
poised
above
the
place
where
the
sphere
had
been
and
in
its
jaws
it
held
the
bar
but
the
end
of
the
bar
the
eight
inches
that
had
been
within
the
sphere
was
gone
it
had
been
sliced
off
so
sharply
that
it
left
a
highly
reflective
concave
mirror
on
the
severed
surface
where
is
it
demanded
manning
in
that
higher
dimension
russ
shook
his
head
you
noticed
that
rushing
sensation
that
may
have
been
the
energy
of
matter
rushing
into
some
other
space
it
may
be
the
key
to
the
energy
of
matter
gregory
manning
stared
at
the
bar
i
staying
with
you
russ
seeing
this
thing
through
i
knew
you
would
said
russ
triumph
flamed
briefly
in
manning
eyes
and
when
we
finish
have
something
that
will
break
interplanetary
we
smash
their
stranglehold
on
the
solar
system
he
stopped
and
looked
at
page
lord
russ
he
whispered
do
you
realize
what
we
have
i
think
i
do
greg
the
scientist
answered
soberly
material
energy
engines
power
so
cheap
that
you
wo
be
able
to
give
it
away
more
power
than
anybody
could
ever
need
russ
hunched
over
the
keyboard
set
in
the
control
room
of
the
and
stared
down
at
the
keys
the
equation
was
set
and
ready
all
he
had
to
do
was
tap
that
key
and
they
would
know
beyond
all
argument
whether
or
not
they
had
dipped
into
the
awful
heart
of
material
energy
whether
finally
they
held
in
their
grasp
the
key
to
the
release
of
energy
that
would
give
the
system
power
to
spare
his
glance
lifted
from
the
keyboard
looked
out
the
observation
port
through
the
inkiness
of
space
ran
a
faint
blue
thread
a
tiny
line
that
stretched
from
the
ship
and
away
until
it
was
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
void
one
hundred
thousand
miles
away
that
thread
touched
the
surface
of
a
steel
ball
bearing
a
speck
in
the
immensity
of
space
he
thought
about
that
little
beam
of
blue
it
took
power
to
do
that
power
to
hold
a
beam
tight
and
strong
and
steady
through
the
stress
of
one
hundred
thousand
miles
but
it
had
to
be
that
far
away
and
they
had
that
power
from
the
bowels
of
the
ship
came
the
deep
purr
of
it
the
angry
silky
song
of
mighty
engines
throttled
down
he
heard
harry
wilson
shuffling
impatiently
behind
him
smelled
the
acrid
smoke
that
floated
from
the
tip
of
wilson
cigarette
might
as
well
punch
that
key
russ
said
manning
cool
voice
we
have
to
find
out
sooner
or
later
russ
finger
hovered
over
the
key
steadied
and
held
when
he
punched
that
key
if
everything
worked
right
the
energy
in
the
tiny
ball
bearing
would
be
released
instantaneously
the
energy
of
a
piece
of
steel
weighing
less
than
an
ounce
over
that
tight
beam
of
blue
would
flash
the
impulse
of
destruction
his
fingers
plunged
down
space
flamed
in
front
of
them
for
just
an
instant
the
void
seemed
filled
with
an
angry
bursting
fire
that
lapped
with
hungry
tongues
of
cold
blue
light
toward
the
distant
planets
a
flare
so
intense
that
it
was
visible
on
the
jovian
worlds
three
hundred
million
miles
away
it
lighted
the
of
earth
blotting
out
the
stars
and
moon
sending
astronomers
scurrying
for
their
telescopes
rating
streamers
in
the
night
editions
slowly
russ
turned
around
and
faced
his
friend
we
have
it
greg
he
said
we
really
have
it
we
tested
the
control
formulas
all
along
the
line
we
know
what
we
can
do
we
do
know
it
all
yet
declared
greg
we
know
we
can
make
it
work
but
i
have
a
feeling
we
have
more
than
skimmed
the
surface
possibilities
russ
sank
into
a
chair
and
stared
about
the
room
they
knew
they
could
generate
alternating
current
of
any
frequency
they
chose
by
use
of
a
special
collector
apparatus
they
could
release
radiant
energy
in
almost
any
quantity
they
desired
in
any
from
the
longest
radio
to
the
incredibly
hard
cosmics
the
electrical
power
they
could
measure
accurately
and
easily
by
simple
voltmeters
and
ammeters
but
radiant
energy
was
another
thing
when
it
passed
all
hitherto
known
bonds
it
would
simply
fuse
any
instrument
they
might
use
to
measure
it
but
they
knew
the
power
they
generated
in
one
split
second
they
had
burst
the
energy
bonds
of
a
tiny
bit
of
steel
and
that
energy
had
glared
briefly
more
hotly
than
the
sun
greg
he
said
it
is
often
you
can
say
that
any
event
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
you
can
with
this
the
era
of
unlimited
power
it
kind
of
scares
me
up
until
a
hundred
years
ago
coal
and
oil
and
oxygen
had
been
the
main
power
sources
but
with
the
dwindling
of
the
supply
of
coal
and
oil
man
had
sought
another
way
he
had
turned
back
to
the
old
dream
of
snatching
power
direct
from
the
sun
in
the
year
patterson
had
perfected
the
then
the
alexanderson
accumulators
made
it
possible
to
pump
the
of
power
to
the
far
reaches
of
the
system
and
on
mercury
and
venus
and
to
a
lesser
extent
on
earth
great
accumulator
power
plants
had
sprung
up
with
interplanetary
under
the
driving
genius
of
spencer
chambers
gaining
control
of
the
market
the
and
the
accumulator
had
spurred
interplanetary
trade
and
settlement
until
it
had
been
possible
to
store
for
the
driving
of
spaceships
and
for
shipment
to
the
outer
planets
ships
had
been
driven
by
rocket
fuel
and
the
struggling
colonies
on
the
outer
worlds
had
fought
a
bitter
battle
without
the
aid
of
ready
power
coal
and
oil
there
were
in
plenty
on
the
outer
worlds
but
one
other
essential
was
lacking
oxygen
coal
on
mars
for
instance
had
to
burned
under
synthetic
air
pressures
like
the
old
carburetor
the
result
was
inefficiency
a
lot
of
coal
burned
not
enough
power
delivered
even
the
were
inefficient
when
attempts
were
made
to
operate
them
beyond
the
earth
that
was
the
maximum
distance
for
maximum
solar
efficiency
russ
dug
into
the
pocket
of
his
faded
scuffed
leather
jacket
and
hauled
forth
pipe
and
pouch
thoughtfully
he
tamped
the
tobacco
into
the
bowl
three
months
he
said
three
months
of
damn
hard
work
yeah
agreed
wilson
we
sure
have
worked
wilson
face
was
haggard
his
eyes
red
he
blew
smoke
through
his
nostrils
when
we
get
back
how
about
us
taking
a
little
vacation
he
asked
russ
laughed
you
can
if
you
want
to
greg
and
i
are
keeping
on
we
ca
waste
time
manning
said
spencer
chambers
may
get
wind
of
this
he
move
all
hell
to
stop
us
wilson
spat
out
his
cigarette
why
do
you
patent
what
you
have
that
would
protect
you
russ
grinned
but
it
was
a
sour
one
no
use
said
greg
chambers
would
tie
us
up
in
a
mile
of
legal
red
tape
it
would
be
just
like
walking
up
and
handing
it
to
him
you
guys
go
ahead
and
work
wilson
stated
i
taking
a
vacation
three
months
is
too
damn
long
to
stay
out
in
a
spaceship
it
does
seem
long
to
me
said
greg
his
tone
cold
and
sharp
no
thought
russ
it
had
seemed
long
perhaps
the
hours
had
been
rough
the
work
hard
but
he
had
noticed
sleep
and
food
had
come
in
snatches
for
three
months
they
had
worked
in
space
not
daring
to
carry
out
their
experiments
on
earth
frankly
afraid
of
the
thing
they
had
he
glanced
at
manning
the
three
months
had
left
no
mark
upon
him
no
hint
of
fatigue
or
strain
russ
understood
now
how
manning
had
done
the
things
he
did
the
man
was
all
steel
and
flame
nothing
could
touch
him
we
still
have
a
lot
to
do
said
manning
russ
leaned
back
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
yes
there
was
a
lot
to
do
transmission
problems
for
instance
to
conduct
away
such
terrific
power
as
they
knew
they
were
capable
of
developing
would
require
copper
or
silver
bars
as
thick
as
a
thigh
and
even
so
at
voltages
capable
of
jumping
a
spark
gap
obviously
a
small
machine
such
as
they
now
had
would
be
impractical
no
matter
how
perfectly
it
might
be
insulated
the
atmosphere
itself
would
not
be
an
insulator
with
power
such
as
this
and
if
one
tried
to
deliver
the
energy
as
a
mechanical
rotation
of
a
shaft
what
shaft
could
transmit
it
safely
and
under
control
oh
hell
russ
burst
out
let
get
back
to
earth
harry
wilson
watched
the
couple
alight
from
the
walk
up
the
broad
steps
and
pass
through
the
magic
portals
of
the
martian
club
he
could
imagine
what
the
club
was
like
the
deference
of
the
management
the
exotic
atmosphere
of
the
dining
room
the
excellence
of
the
long
cold
drinks
served
at
the
bar
mysterious
drinks
concocted
of
ingredients
harvested
in
the
jungles
of
venus
spiced
with
produce
from
the
irrigated
gardens
of
mars
he
puffed
on
the
dangling
cigarette
and
shuffled
on
along
the
airy
highwalk
below
and
above
him
all
around
him
flowed
the
beauty
and
the
glamor
the
bravery
and
the
splendor
of
new
york
the
city
song
was
in
his
ears
the
surging
noises
that
were
its
voice
two
thousand
feet
above
his
head
reared
giant
pinnacles
of
shining
metal
glinting
in
the
noonday
sun
architecture
that
bore
the
alien
stamp
of
other
worlds
wilson
turned
around
stared
at
the
martian
club
a
man
needed
money
to
pass
through
those
doors
to
taste
the
drinks
that
slid
across
its
bar
to
sit
and
watch
its
floor
shows
to
hear
the
music
of
its
orchestras
for
a
moment
he
stood
hesitating
as
if
he
were
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
he
flipped
away
the
cigarette
turned
on
his
heel
walked
briskly
to
the
automatic
elevator
which
would
take
him
to
the
lower
levels
there
on
the
third
level
he
entered
a
mecho
restaurant
sat
down
at
a
table
and
ordered
from
the
robot
waiter
pushing
buttons
on
the
menu
before
him
he
ate
leisurely
smoked
ferociously
thinking
looking
at
his
watch
he
saw
that
it
was
nearly
two
he
walked
to
the
cashier
machine
inserted
the
metallic
check
with
the
correct
change
and
received
from
the
clicking
chuckling
register
the
disk
that
would
let
him
out
the
door
thank
you
come
again
the
fluted
do
mention
it
growled
wilson
outside
the
restaurant
he
walked
briskly
ten
blocks
away
he
came
to
a
building
roofing
four
square
blocks
over
the
massive
doorway
set
into
the
beryllium
steel
was
a
map
of
the
solar
system
a
map
that
served
as
a
cosmic
clock
tracing
the
movement
of
the
planets
as
they
swung
in
their
long
arcs
around
the
sun
the
solar
system
was
straddled
by
glowing
golden
letters
they
read
interplanetary
building
it
was
from
here
that
spencer
chambers
ruled
his
empire
built
on
power
wilson
went
inside
the
new
apparatus
was
set
up
a
machine
that
almost
filled
the
laboratory
a
giant
compact
mass
of
heavy
solidly
built
metal
work
tied
together
by
beams
of
girderlike
construction
it
was
meant
to
stand
up
under
the
hammering
of
unimaginable
power
the
stress
of
unknown
spatial
factors
slowly
carefully
russell
page
tapped
keys
on
the
control
board
setting
up
an
equation
sucking
thoughtfully
at
his
pipe
he
checked
and
rechecked
them
harry
wilson
regarded
him
through
squinted
eyes
what
the
hell
is
going
to
happen
now
he
asked
we
have
to
wait
and
see
russ
answered
we
know
what
we
want
to
happen
what
we
hope
will
happen
but
we
never
can
be
sure
we
are
working
with
conditions
that
are
entirely
new
sitting
beside
a
table
littered
with
papers
staring
at
the
gigantic
machine
before
him
gregory
manning
said
slowly
that
thing
simply
has
to
adapt
itself
to
spaceship
drive
there
everything
there
needed
for
space
propulsion
unlimited
power
from
a
minimum
of
fuel
efficiency
entire
independence
of
any
set
condition
because
the
stuff
creates
its
own
conditions
he
slowly
wagged
his
head
the
secret
is
some
place
along
the
line
he
declared
i
feel
that
we
must
be
getting
close
to
it
russ
walked
from
the
control
board
to
the
table
picked
up
a
sheaf
of
papers
and
leafed
through
them
he
selected
a
handful
and
shook
them
in
his
fist
i
thought
i
had
it
here
he
said
my
math
must
have
been
wrong
some
factor
that
i
did
include
in
the
equation
you
keep
finding
factors
for
some
time
yet
greg
prophesied
repulsion
would
have
been
the
answer
said
russ
bitterly
and
the
lord
knows
we
have
it
plenty
of
it
too
much
observed
wilson
smoke
drooling
from
his
nostrils
not
too
much
corrected
greg
inefficient
control
you
jump
at
conclusions
wilson
the
math
did
show
that
progressive
action
said
russ
it
showed
repulsion
negative
gravity
that
could
be
built
up
until
it
would
shoot
the
ship
outside
the
solar
system
within
an
hour
time
faster
than
light
we
do
know
how
many
times
faster
forget
it
advised
greg
the
way
it
stands
it
useless
you
get
repulsion
by
progressive
steps
a
series
of
squares
with
one
constant
factor
it
would
be
any
good
for
space
travel
imagine
trying
to
use
it
on
a
spaceship
you
start
with
a
terrific
jolt
the
acceleration
would
fade
and
just
when
you
were
recovering
from
the
first
jolt
get
a
second
one
and
that
second
one
would
iron
you
out
a
spaceship
could
take
it
let
alone
a
human
body
maybe
this
will
do
it
said
wilson
hopefully
maybe
agreed
russ
anyhow
we
try
it
equation
it
might
do
the
trick
said
greg
it
a
new
approach
to
the
gravity
angle
the
equation
explains
the
shifting
of
gravitational
lines
the
changing
and
contortion
of
their
direction
twist
gravity
and
you
have
a
perfect
space
drive
as
good
as
negative
gravity
better
perhaps
more
easily
controlled
would
make
for
more
delicate
precise
handling
russ
laid
down
the
sheaf
of
papers
lit
his
pipe
and
walked
to
the
apparatus
here
goes
he
said
his
hand
went
out
to
the
power
lever
eased
it
in
with
a
roar
the
material
energy
engine
built
within
the
apparatus
surged
into
action
sending
a
flow
of
power
through
the
massive
leads
the
thunder
mounted
in
the
room
the
laboratory
seemed
to
shudder
with
the
impact
wilson
watching
intently
cried
out
a
brief
cry
a
wave
of
dizziness
engulfed
him
the
walls
seemed
to
be
falling
in
the
room
and
the
machine
were
blurring
russ
at
the
controls
seemed
horribly
disjointed
manning
was
a
caricature
of
a
man
a
weird
strange
figure
that
moved
and
gestured
in
the
mad
room
wilson
fought
against
the
dizziness
he
tried
to
take
a
step
and
the
floor
seemed
to
leap
up
and
meet
his
outstretched
foot
throwing
him
off
balance
his
cigarette
fell
out
of
his
mouth
rolled
along
the
floor
russ
was
shouting
something
but
the
words
were
distorted
loud
one
instant
rising
over
the
din
of
the
apparatus
a
mere
whisper
the
next
they
made
no
sense
there
was
a
peculiar
whistling
in
the
air
a
sound
such
as
he
had
never
heard
before
it
seemed
to
come
from
far
away
a
high
thin
shriek
that
was
torture
in
one
ears
giddy
seized
with
deathly
nausea
wilson
clawed
his
way
across
the
floor
swung
open
the
laboratory
door
and
stumbled
outdoors
he
weaved
across
the
lawn
and
clung
to
a
sun
dial
panting
he
looked
back
at
the
laboratory
and
gasped
in
disbelief
all
the
trees
were
bent
toward
the
building
as
if
held
by
some
mighty
wind
their
branches
straining
every
single
leaf
standing
at
rigid
attention
the
trees
were
bending
in
toward
the
structure
there
was
no
and
then
he
noticed
something
else
no
matter
where
the
trees
stood
no
matter
in
what
direction
from
the
laboratory
they
all
bent
inward
toward
the
building
and
the
whining
thundering
shrieking
machine
inside
the
laboratory
an
empty
bottle
crashed
off
a
table
and
smashed
into
a
thousand
fragments
the
tinkling
of
the
broken
glass
was
a
silvery
momentary
sound
that
protested
against
the
blasting
thrum
of
power
that
shook
the
walls
manning
fought
along
the
floor
to
russ
side
russ
roared
in
his
ear
gravitational
control
concentration
of
gravitational
lines
the
papers
on
the
desk
started
to
slide
slithering
onto
the
floor
danced
a
crazy
dervish
across
the
room
liquids
in
the
laboratory
bottles
were
climbing
the
sides
of
glass
instead
of
lying
at
rest
parallel
with
the
floor
a
chair
skated
bucking
and
tipping
crazily
toward
the
door
russ
jerked
the
power
lever
back
to
zero
the
power
hum
died
the
liquids
slid
back
to
their
natural
level
the
chair
tipped
over
and
lay
still
papers
fluttered
gently
downward
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
across
the
few
feet
of
floor
space
between
them
russ
wiped
beads
of
perspiration
from
his
forehead
with
his
shirt
sleeve
he
sucked
on
his
pipe
but
it
was
dead
greg
russ
said
jubilantly
we
have
something
better
than
we
have
something
you
might
call
gravity
gravity
that
we
can
control
your
grandfather
nullified
gravity
gone
him
one
better
greg
gestured
toward
the
machine
you
created
an
attraction
center
what
else
but
the
center
itself
is
not
actually
an
attracting
force
the
fourth
dimension
is
mixed
up
in
this
we
have
a
sort
of
lens
that
concentrates
the
lines
of
any
gravitational
force
concentration
in
the
fourth
dimension
turns
the
force
loose
in
three
dimensions
but
we
can
take
care
of
that
by
using
mirrors
of
our
we
can
arrange
it
so
that
it
turns
the
force
loose
in
only
one
dimension
greg
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
we
can
guide
a
ship
by
a
series
of
lenses
he
declared
at
last
but
here
the
really
important
thing
that
field
concentrates
the
forces
of
gravity
already
present
those
forces
exist
throughout
all
of
space
there
are
gravitational
lines
everywhere
we
can
concentrate
them
in
any
direction
we
want
to
in
reality
we
fall
toward
the
body
which
originally
caused
the
force
of
gravitation
not
to
the
concentration
russ
nodded
that
means
we
can
create
a
field
immediately
ahead
of
the
ship
the
ship
would
fall
into
it
constantly
with
the
concentration
moving
on
ahead
the
field
would
tend
to
break
down
in
proportion
to
the
strain
imposed
and
a
big
ship
especially
when
you
are
building
up
speed
would
tend
to
enlarge
it
open
it
up
but
the
field
could
be
kept
tight
by
supplying
energy
and
we
have
plenty
of
that
far
more
than
we
ever
need
we
supply
the
energy
but
that
only
a
small
part
of
it
the
body
emitting
the
gravitational
force
supplies
the
fulcrum
that
moves
us
along
it
would
operate
beyond
the
planets
said
greg
it
would
operate
equally
well
anywhere
in
space
for
all
of
space
is
filled
with
gravitational
stress
we
could
use
gravitational
bodies
many
light
years
away
as
the
driver
of
our
ships
a
light
glowed
momentarily
in
his
eyes
russ
he
said
we
going
to
put
space
fields
to
work
at
last
he
walked
to
the
chair
picked
it
up
and
sat
down
in
it
we
start
building
a
ship
he
stated
just
as
soon
as
we
know
the
mechanics
of
this
gravity
concentration
and
control
russ
we
build
the
greatest
ship
the
fastest
ship
the
most
powerful
ship
the
solar
system
has
ever
known
damn
said
russ
that
thing
slipped
again
he
glared
at
the
offending
nut
i
put
a
lock
washer
on
it
this
time
wilson
stepped
toward
the
control
board
from
his
perch
on
the
apparatus
russ
motioned
him
away
never
mind
discharging
the
field
he
said
i
can
get
around
it
somehow
wilson
squinted
at
him
this
tooth
is
near
killing
me
still
got
a
toothache
asked
russ
never
got
a
wink
of
sleep
last
night
you
better
run
down
to
frisco
and
have
it
yanked
out
suggested
the
scientist
ca
have
you
laid
up
yeah
that
right
agreed
wilson
maybe
i
will
we
got
a
lot
to
do
russ
reached
out
and
clamped
his
wrench
on
the
nut
quickly
backed
it
off
and
slipped
on
the
washer
viciously
he
tightened
it
home
the
wrench
stuck
gritting
his
teeth
on
the
bit
of
his
pipe
russ
cursed
soundlessly
he
yanked
savagely
at
the
wrench
it
slipped
from
his
hand
hung
for
a
minute
on
the
nut
and
then
plunged
downward
falling
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
new
force
field
they
had
developed
russ
froze
and
watched
his
heart
in
his
throat
mad
thoughts
in
his
brain
in
a
flash
as
the
wrench
fell
he
remembered
that
they
knew
nothing
about
this
field
all
they
knew
was
that
any
matter
introduced
in
it
suddenly
acquired
an
acceleration
in
the
dimension
known
as
time
with
its
normal
constant
of
duration
reduced
to
zero
when
that
wrench
struck
the
field
it
would
cease
to
exist
but
something
else
might
happen
too
something
entirely
unguessable
the
wrench
fell
only
a
few
feet
but
it
seemed
to
take
long
seconds
as
russ
watched
frozen
in
fascination
he
saw
it
strike
the
hazy
glow
that
defined
the
limits
of
the
field
saw
it
floating
down
as
if
its
speed
had
been
slowed
by
some
dense
medium
in
the
instant
that
hazy
glow
intensified
a
thousand
times
became
a
blinding
russ
ducked
his
head
shielded
his
eyes
from
the
terrible
blast
of
light
a
rending
shuddering
thud
seemed
to
echo
in
space
rather
than
in
air
and
both
field
and
wrench
were
gone
a
moment
passed
then
another
and
there
was
the
heavy
solid
clanging
thud
of
something
striking
metal
this
time
the
thud
was
not
in
space
but
a
commonplace
noise
as
if
someone
had
dropped
a
tool
on
the
floor
above
russ
turned
around
and
stared
at
wilson
wilson
stared
back
his
mouth
hanging
open
the
smoldering
cigarette
dangling
from
his
mouth
greg
russ
shouted
his
cry
shattering
the
silence
in
the
laboratory
a
door
burst
open
and
manning
stepped
into
the
main
laboratory
room
a
calculation
pad
in
one
hand
a
pencil
in
the
other
what
the
matter
he
demanded
we
have
to
find
my
wrench
your
wrench
greg
was
puzzled
ca
you
get
another
i
dropped
it
into
the
field
its
was
reduced
to
zero
it
became
an
wrench
nothing
new
in
that
said
greg
unruffled
but
there
is
persisted
russ
the
field
collapsed
you
see
maybe
the
wrench
was
too
big
for
it
to
handle
and
when
the
field
collapsed
the
wrench
gained
a
new
i
heard
it
we
have
to
find
it
the
three
of
them
pounded
up
the
stairs
to
the
room
where
russ
had
heard
the
thump
there
was
nothing
on
the
floor
they
searched
the
room
from
end
to
end
then
the
other
rooms
there
was
no
wrench
at
the
end
of
an
hour
greg
went
back
to
the
main
laboratory
brought
back
a
portable
fluoroscope
maybe
this
will
do
the
trick
he
announced
bleakly
it
did
they
found
the
wrench
the
space
between
the
russ
stared
at
the
shadow
in
the
fluoroscope
plate
undeniably
it
was
the
shadow
of
the
wrench
fourth
dimension
he
said
transported
in
time
the
muscles
in
greg
cheeks
were
tensed
that
old
flame
of
excitement
burning
in
his
eyes
but
otherwise
his
face
was
the
mask
of
old
the
calm
almost
terrible
mask
that
had
faced
a
thousand
dangers
power
and
time
he
corrected
if
we
can
control
it
said
russ
do
worry
we
can
control
it
and
when
we
can
it
the
biggest
thing
we
got
wilson
licked
his
lips
dredged
a
cigarette
out
of
a
pocket
if
you
do
mind
he
said
i
hit
for
frisco
tonight
this
tooth
of
mine
is
getting
worse
sure
ca
keep
an
aching
tooth
agreed
russ
thinking
of
the
wrench
while
talking
can
i
take
your
ship
asked
wilson
sure
said
russ
back
in
the
laboratory
they
rebuilt
the
field
dropped
little
ball
bearings
in
it
the
ball
bearings
disappeared
they
found
them
everywhere
in
the
walls
in
tables
in
the
floor
some
still
existing
in
their
new
hung
in
invisible
intangible
but
there
hours
followed
hours
with
the
sheet
of
data
growing
math
machines
whirred
and
chuckled
and
clicked
wilson
departed
for
san
francisco
with
his
aching
tooth
the
other
two
worked
on
by
dawn
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
out
of
the
chaos
of
happenstance
they
were
finding
rules
of
order
certain
formulas
of
behavior
equations
of
force
the
next
day
they
tried
heavier
more
complicated
things
and
learned
still
more
a
radiogram
phoned
from
the
nearest
spaceport
forty
miles
distant
informed
them
that
wilson
would
not
be
back
for
a
few
days
his
tooth
was
worse
than
he
had
thought
required
an
operation
and
treatment
of
the
jaw
hell
said
russ
just
when
he
could
be
so
much
help
with
wilson
gone
the
two
of
them
tackled
the
controlling
device
labored
and
swore
over
it
but
finally
it
was
completed
slumped
in
chairs
utterly
exhausted
they
looked
proudly
at
it
with
that
said
russ
we
can
take
an
object
and
transport
it
any
place
we
want
not
only
that
we
can
pick
up
any
object
from
an
indefinite
distance
and
bring
it
to
us
what
a
thing
for
a
lazy
burglar
greg
observed
sourly
worn
out
they
gulped
sandwiches
and
scalding
coffee
tumbled
into
bed
the
outdoor
camp
meeting
was
in
full
swing
the
evangelist
was
in
his
top
form
the
sinners
bench
was
crowded
then
suddenly
as
the
evangelist
paused
for
a
moment
silence
before
he
drove
home
an
important
point
the
music
came
music
from
the
air
music
from
somewhere
in
the
sky
the
soft
heavenly
music
of
a
hymn
as
if
an
angels
chorus
were
singing
in
the
blue
the
evangelist
froze
one
arm
pointing
upward
with
index
finger
ready
to
sweep
down
and
emphasize
his
point
the
sinners
kneeling
at
the
bench
were
petrified
the
congregation
was
astounded
the
hymn
rolled
on
punctuated
backgrounded
by
deep
celestial
organ
notes
the
clear
voice
of
the
choir
swept
high
to
a
note
behold
shrieked
the
evangelist
behold
a
miracle
angels
singing
for
us
kneel
kneel
and
pray
nobody
stood
andy
mcintyre
was
drunk
again
in
the
piteous
glare
of
he
staggered
homeward
from
the
poker
party
in
the
back
of
steve
harness
shop
the
light
revealed
him
to
the
scorn
of
the
entire
village
at
the
corner
of
elm
and
third
he
ran
into
a
maple
tree
uncertainly
he
backed
away
intent
on
making
another
try
suddenly
the
tree
spoke
to
him
alcohol
is
the
scourge
of
mankind
it
turns
men
into
beasts
it
robs
them
of
their
brains
it
shortens
their
lives
andy
stared
unable
to
believe
what
he
heard
the
tree
he
had
no
doubt
was
talking
to
him
personally
the
voice
of
the
tree
went
on
takes
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
women
and
children
fosters
crime
weakens
the
moral
fiber
of
the
nation
stop
screamed
andy
stop
i
tell
you
the
tree
stopped
talking
all
he
could
hear
was
the
whisper
of
wind
among
its
leaves
suddenly
running
andy
darted
around
the
corner
headed
home
begad
he
told
himself
when
trees
start
talkin
to
you
it
time
to
lay
off
the
bottle
in
another
town
fifty
miles
distant
from
the
one
in
which
the
tree
had
talked
to
andy
mcintyre
another
miracle
happened
that
same
sunday
morning
dozens
of
people
heard
the
bronze
statue
of
the
soldier
in
the
courtyard
speak
the
statue
did
not
come
to
life
it
stood
as
ever
a
solid
piece
of
golden
bronze
in
spots
turned
black
and
green
by
weather
but
from
its
lips
came
words
words
that
burned
themselves
into
the
souls
of
those
who
heard
words
that
exhorted
them
to
defend
the
principles
for
which
many
men
had
died
to
grasp
and
hold
high
the
torch
of
democracy
and
liberty
in
somber
bitterness
the
statue
called
spencer
chambers
the
greatest
threat
to
that
liberty
and
freedom
for
the
statue
said
spencer
chambers
and
interplanetary
power
were
waging
an
economic
war
a
bloodless
one
but
just
as
truly
war
as
if
there
were
cannons
firing
and
bombs
exploding
for
a
full
five
minutes
the
statue
spoke
and
the
crowd
growing
by
the
minute
stood
dumbfounded
then
silence
fell
over
the
courtyard
the
statue
stood
as
before
unmoving
its
timeless
eyes
staring
out
from
under
the
ugly
helmet
its
hands
gripping
the
bayoneted
rifle
a
blue
and
white
pigeon
fluttered
softly
down
alighted
on
the
bayonet
looked
the
crowd
over
and
then
flew
to
the
courthouse
tower
back
in
the
laboratory
russ
looked
at
greg
that
radio
trick
gives
me
an
idea
he
said
if
we
can
put
a
radio
in
statues
and
trees
without
interfering
with
its
operation
why
ca
we
do
the
same
thing
with
a
television
set
greg
started
think
of
the
possibilities
of
that
he
burst
out
within
an
hour
a
complete
television
sending
apparatus
was
placed
within
the
field
and
a
receptor
screen
set
up
in
the
laboratory
the
two
moved
chairs
in
front
of
the
screen
and
sat
down
russ
reached
out
and
pulled
the
switch
of
the
field
control
the
screen
came
to
life
but
it
was
only
a
gray
blur
it
traveling
too
fast
said
greg
slow
it
down
russ
retarded
the
lever
when
that
thing
on
full
it
almost
instantaneous
it
travels
in
a
time
dimension
and
any
speed
slower
than
instantaneity
is
a
modification
of
that
force
field
on
the
screen
swam
a
panorama
of
the
mountains
mile
after
mile
of
peaks
and
valleys
ablaze
with
the
flames
of
autumn
foliage
the
mountains
faded
away
there
was
desert
now
and
then
a
city
russ
dropped
the
televisor
set
lower
down
into
a
street
for
half
an
hour
they
sat
comfortably
in
their
chairs
and
watched
men
and
women
walking
witnessed
one
dog
fight
cruised
slowly
up
and
down
looking
into
windows
of
homes
in
the
business
section
there
just
one
thing
wrong
said
greg
we
can
see
everything
but
we
ca
hear
a
sound
we
can
fix
that
russ
told
him
he
lifted
the
televisor
set
from
the
streets
brought
it
back
across
the
desert
and
mountains
into
the
laboratory
we
have
two
practical
applications
now
said
greg
space
drive
and
television
spying
i
do
know
which
is
the
best
do
you
realize
that
with
this
television
trick
there
is
a
thing
that
can
be
hidden
from
us
i
believe
we
can
go
to
mars
or
mercury
or
anywhere
we
want
to
with
this
thing
it
does
seem
to
have
any
particular
limits
it
handles
perfectly
you
can
move
it
a
fraction
of
an
inch
as
easily
as
a
hundred
miles
and
it
fast
almost
instantaneous
not
quite
for
even
with
our
acceleration
within
time
there
is
a
slight
lag
by
evening
they
had
an
audio
apparatus
incorporated
in
the
set
had
wired
the
screen
for
sound
let
put
this
to
practical
use
suggested
greg
there
a
show
at
the
new
mercury
theater
in
new
york
i
been
wanting
to
see
knock
off
work
and
take
in
that
show
now
said
russ
you
really
have
an
idea
the
ticket
scalpers
are
charging
a
fortune
and
it
wo
cost
us
a
cent
to
get
in
pine
roots
burned
brightly
in
the
fireplace
snapping
and
sizzling
as
the
blaze
caught
and
flamed
on
the
resin
deep
in
an
easy
chair
greg
manning
stretched
his
long
legs
out
toward
the
fire
and
lifted
his
glass
squinting
at
the
flames
through
the
amber
drink
there
something
that
been
worrying
me
a
little
he
said
i
told
you
about
it
because
i
figured
it
was
as
serious
as
it
looked
maybe
it
is
but
it
looks
funny
what
that
asked
russ
the
stock
market
replied
greg
there
something
devilish
funny
going
on
there
i
lost
about
a
billion
dollars
in
the
last
two
weeks
a
dollars
gasped
russ
greg
swirled
the
whiskey
in
his
glass
do
sound
so
horrified
the
loss
is
all
on
paper
my
stocks
have
gone
down
most
of
them
cut
in
half
some
even
less
than
that
martian
irrigation
is
down
to
i
paid
for
it
it
worth
you
mean
something
has
happened
to
the
market
not
to
the
market
if
that
was
it
i
would
worry
i
seen
the
market
go
up
and
down
that
nothing
to
worry
about
but
the
market
except
for
a
slight
depression
has
behaved
normally
in
these
past
two
weeks
it
almost
looks
as
if
somebody
was
out
to
get
me
who
want
to
and
why
greg
sighed
i
wish
i
knew
i
have
really
lost
a
cent
of
course
my
shares
ca
stay
down
for
very
long
the
thing
is
that
right
now
i
ca
sell
them
even
for
what
i
paid
for
them
if
i
sold
now
i
lose
that
billion
but
as
long
as
i
do
have
to
sell
the
loss
is
merely
on
paper
he
sipped
at
the
drink
and
stared
into
the
fire
if
you
do
have
to
what
are
you
worrying
about
asked
russ
couple
of
things
i
put
that
stock
up
as
collateral
to
get
the
cash
to
build
the
spaceship
at
present
prices
it
will
take
more
securities
than
i
thought
if
the
prices
continue
to
go
down
i
have
the
bulk
of
my
holdings
tied
up
in
the
spaceship
i
might
even
be
forced
to
liquidate
some
of
it
and
that
would
mean
an
actual
loss
he
hunched
forward
in
the
chair
stared
at
russ
another
thing
he
said
grimly
is
that
i
hate
the
idea
of
somebody
singling
me
out
as
a
target
as
if
they
were
going
to
make
a
financial
example
of
me
and
it
sounds
as
if
someone
has
agreed
russ
greg
leaned
back
again
drained
his
glass
and
set
it
down
it
certainly
does
he
said
outside
seen
through
the
window
beside
the
fireplace
the
harvest
moon
was
a
shield
of
silver
hung
in
the
velvet
of
the
sky
a
lonesome
wind
moaned
in
the
pines
and
under
the
eaves
i
got
a
report
from
belgium
the
other
day
said
greg
the
spaceship
is
coming
along
it
be
the
biggest
thing
afloat
in
space
the
biggest
and
the
toughest
said
russ
and
greg
nodded
silent
agreement
the
ship
itself
was
being
manufactured
at
the
great
space
works
in
belgium
but
other
parts
of
it
apparatus
engines
gadgets
of
every
description
were
being
manufactured
at
other
widely
scattered
points
anyone
wondering
what
kind
of
ship
the
finished
product
would
be
would
have
a
hard
time
gathering
the
correct
information
which
of
course
was
the
idea
the
anyone
they
were
guarding
against
was
spencer
chambers
we
need
a
better
television
set
said
russ
this
one
we
have
is
all
right
but
we
need
the
best
there
is
i
wonder
if
wilson
could
get
us
one
in
frisco
and
bring
it
back
i
do
see
why
not
said
greg
send
him
a
radio
russ
stepped
to
the
phone
called
the
spaceport
and
filed
the
message
he
always
stays
at
the
greater
martian
he
told
greg
we
probably
catch
him
there
two
hours
later
the
phone
rang
it
was
the
spaceport
that
message
you
sent
to
wilson
said
the
voice
of
the
operator
ca
be
delivered
wilson
is
at
the
greater
martian
the
clerk
said
he
checked
out
for
new
york
last
night
did
he
leave
a
forwarding
address
asked
russ
apparently
not
russ
hung
up
the
receiver
frowning
wilson
is
in
new
york
greg
looked
up
from
a
sheet
of
calculations
new
york
eh
he
said
and
then
went
back
to
work
but
a
moment
later
he
straightened
from
his
work
what
would
wilson
be
doing
in
new
york
i
wonder
russ
stopped
and
shook
his
head
exactly
said
greg
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
considering
the
muscles
in
his
cheeks
knotting
russ
we
both
are
thinking
the
same
thing
i
hate
to
think
it
said
russ
evenly
i
hate
to
think
such
a
thing
about
a
man
one
way
to
find
out
declared
greg
he
rose
from
the
chair
and
walked
to
the
television
control
board
snapped
the
switch
russ
took
a
chair
beside
him
on
the
screen
the
mountains
danced
weirdly
as
the
set
rocketed
swiftly
away
and
then
came
the
glint
of
red
and
yellow
desert
blackness
blanked
out
the
screen
as
the
set
plunged
into
the
ground
passing
through
the
curvature
of
the
earth
surface
the
blackness
passed
and
fields
and
farms
were
beneath
them
on
the
screen
a
green
and
brown
checkerboard
with
tiny
white
lines
that
were
roads
new
york
was
in
the
screen
now
greg
hand
moved
the
control
and
the
city
rushed
up
at
them
the
spires
speeding
toward
them
like
plunging
spears
down
into
the
canyons
plunged
the
set
down
into
the
financial
district
with
its
beetling
buildings
that
hemmed
in
the
roaring
traffic
grimly
surely
greg
drove
his
strange
machine
through
new
york
through
buildings
through
shimmering
planes
through
men
like
an
arrow
the
television
set
sped
to
its
mark
and
then
greg
hand
snapped
back
the
lever
and
in
the
screen
was
a
building
that
covered
four
whole
blocks
above
the
entrance
was
the
famous
solar
system
map
and
straddling
the
map
were
the
gleaming
golden
letters
interplanetary
building
now
we
see
said
greg
he
heard
the
whistle
of
the
breath
in
russ
nostrils
as
the
television
set
began
to
move
saw
the
tight
grip
russ
had
upon
the
chair
arms
the
interior
of
the
building
showed
on
the
screen
as
he
drove
the
set
through
steel
and
stone
offices
and
corridors
and
brief
glimpses
of
steel
partitions
until
it
came
to
a
door
marked
spencer
chambers
president
greg
hand
twisted
the
control
slightly
and
the
set
went
through
the
door
into
the
office
of
spencer
chambers
four
men
were
in
the
room
chambers
himself
craven
the
scientist
arnold
grant
head
of
interplanetary
publicity
department
harry
wilson
voice
came
out
of
the
screen
a
frantic
almost
terrified
voice
i
told
you
all
i
know
i
not
a
scientist
i
a
mechanic
told
you
what
they
doing
i
ca
tell
you
how
they
do
it
arnold
grant
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
his
face
was
twisted
in
fury
there
were
plans
were
there
he
demanded
there
were
equations
and
formulas
why
did
you
bring
us
some
of
them
spencer
chambers
raised
a
hand
from
the
desk
waved
it
toward
grant
the
man
has
told
us
all
he
knows
obviously
he
ca
be
any
more
help
to
us
you
told
him
to
go
back
and
see
if
he
could
find
something
else
did
you
asked
grant
yes
i
did
chambers
told
him
but
apparently
he
could
find
it
i
tried
pleaded
wilson
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
forehead
the
cigarette
in
his
mouth
was
limp
and
dead
one
of
them
was
always
there
i
never
could
get
hold
of
any
papers
i
asked
questions
but
they
were
too
busy
to
answer
and
i
could
ask
too
much
because
then
they
would
have
suspected
me
no
you
could
do
that
commented
craven
with
an
open
sneer
in
the
laboratory
russ
pounded
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
a
clenched
fist
the
rat
sold
us
out
greg
said
nothing
but
his
face
was
stony
and
his
eyes
were
on
the
screen
chambers
was
speaking
to
wilson
do
you
think
you
could
find
something
out
if
you
went
back
again
wilson
squirmed
in
his
chair
i
rather
not
his
voice
sounded
like
a
whimper
i
afraid
they
suspect
me
now
i
afraid
of
what
they
do
if
they
found
out
that
his
conscience
breathed
russ
in
the
laboratory
i
never
suspected
him
he
right
about
one
thing
though
greg
said
he
better
not
come
back
chambers
was
talking
again
you
realize
of
course
that
you
been
much
help
to
us
you
have
only
warned
us
that
another
kind
of
power
generation
is
being
developed
you
set
us
on
our
guard
but
other
than
that
we
no
better
off
than
we
were
before
wilson
bristled
like
a
cowardly
animal
backed
into
a
corner
i
told
you
what
was
going
on
you
can
be
ready
for
it
now
i
ca
help
it
if
i
could
find
out
how
all
them
things
worked
look
here
said
chambers
i
made
a
bargain
with
you
and
i
keep
my
bargains
i
told
you
i
would
pay
you
twenty
thousand
dollars
for
the
information
you
gave
me
when
you
first
came
to
see
me
i
told
you
pay
you
for
any
further
additional
information
you
might
give
also
i
promised
you
a
job
with
the
company
watching
the
financier
wilson
licked
his
lips
that
right
he
said
chambers
reached
out
and
pulled
a
checkbook
toward
him
lifted
a
pen
from
its
holder
i
paying
you
the
twenty
thousand
for
the
warning
i
not
paying
you
a
dime
more
because
you
gave
me
no
other
information
wilson
leaped
to
his
feet
started
to
protest
sit
down
said
chambers
coldly
but
the
job
you
said
you
give
me
a
job
chambers
shook
his
head
i
would
have
a
man
like
you
in
my
organization
if
you
were
a
traitor
to
one
man
you
would
be
to
another
but
but
wilson
started
to
object
and
then
sat
down
his
face
twisted
in
something
that
came
very
close
to
fear
chambers
ripped
the
check
out
of
the
book
waved
it
slowly
in
the
air
to
dry
it
then
he
arose
and
held
it
out
to
wilson
who
reached
out
a
trembling
hand
and
took
it
and
now
said
chambers
good
day
mr
wilson
for
a
moment
wilson
stood
uncertain
as
if
he
intended
to
speak
but
finally
he
turned
without
a
word
and
walked
through
the
door
in
the
laboratory
russ
and
greg
looked
at
one
another
twenty
thousand
said
greg
why
that
was
worth
millions
it
was
worth
everything
chambers
had
said
russ
because
it
the
thing
that
going
to
wreck
him
their
attention
snapped
back
to
the
screen
chambers
was
hunched
over
his
desk
addressing
the
other
two
now
gentlemen
he
asked
what
are
we
to
do
craven
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
was
a
puzzled
frown
in
the
eyes
back
of
the
glasses
we
have
much
to
go
on
wilson
does
know
a
thing
about
it
he
has
the
brain
to
grasp
even
the
most
fundamental
ideas
back
of
the
whole
thing
chambers
nodded
the
man
knew
the
mechanical
setup
perfectly
but
that
was
all
i
constructed
the
apparatus
said
craven
it
astoundingly
simple
almost
too
simple
to
do
the
things
wilson
said
it
would
do
he
drew
plans
for
it
so
clear
that
it
was
easy
to
duplicate
the
apparatus
he
himself
checked
the
machine
and
says
it
is
the
same
as
page
and
manning
have
but
there
are
thousands
of
possible
combinations
for
hookups
and
control
board
settings
too
many
to
try
to
go
through
and
hit
upon
the
right
answer
because
you
see
one
slight
adjustment
in
any
one
of
a
hundred
adjustments
might
do
the
trick
but
which
of
those
adjustments
do
you
have
to
make
we
have
to
have
the
formulas
the
equations
before
we
can
even
move
he
seemed
to
remember
a
few
things
said
grant
hopefully
certain
rules
and
formulas
craven
flipped
both
his
hands
angrily
worse
than
nothing
he
exploded
what
page
and
manning
have
done
is
so
far
in
advance
of
anything
that
anyone
else
has
even
thought
about
that
we
are
completely
at
sea
they
working
with
space
fields
apparently
and
we
even
scratched
the
surface
in
that
branch
of
investigation
we
simply
have
got
a
thing
to
go
on
no
chance
at
all
asked
chambers
craven
shook
his
head
slowly
at
least
you
could
try
snapped
grant
now
wait
chambers
snapped
back
you
seem
to
forget
craven
is
one
of
the
best
scientists
in
the
world
today
i
relying
on
him
craven
smiled
i
ca
do
anything
with
what
page
and
manning
have
but
i
might
try
something
of
my
own
by
all
means
do
so
urged
chambers
he
turned
to
grant
i
observed
you
have
carried
out
the
plans
we
laid
martian
irrigation
hit
a
new
low
today
grant
grinned
it
was
easy
just
a
hint
here
and
there
to
the
right
people
chambers
looked
down
at
his
hands
slowly
closing
into
fists
we
have
to
stop
them
some
way
any
way
at
all
keep
up
the
rumors
we
make
it
impossible
for
greg
manning
to
finance
this
new
invention
we
take
away
every
last
dollar
he
has
he
glared
at
the
publicity
man
you
understand
yes
sir
said
grant
i
understand
perfectly
all
right
said
chambers
and
your
job
craven
is
to
either
develop
what
page
has
found
or
find
something
we
can
use
in
competition
craven
growled
angrily
what
happens
if
your
damn
rumors
ca
ruin
manning
what
if
i
ca
find
anything
in
that
case
said
chambers
there
are
other
ways
other
ways
chambers
suddenly
smiled
at
them
i
have
a
notion
to
call
stutsman
back
to
earth
craven
drummed
his
fingers
idly
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
yes
i
guess
you
do
have
other
ways
he
said
greg
hand
snapped
the
switch
and
the
screen
suddenly
was
blank
as
the
televisor
set
returned
instantly
to
the
laboratory
that
explains
a
lot
of
things
he
said
among
them
what
has
happened
to
my
stocks
russ
sat
in
his
chair
numbed
that
little
ratting
traitor
wilson
he
sell
his
mother
for
a
new
bill
we
know
said
greg
and
chambers
does
know
we
know
we
follow
every
move
he
makes
we
know
every
one
of
his
plans
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
he
was
already
planning
their
campaign
there
are
still
a
few
things
to
do
he
added
a
few
possibilities
we
may
have
overlooked
but
will
we
have
time
asked
russ
i
think
so
chambers
is
going
to
go
slow
the
gamble
is
too
big
to
risk
any
slip
he
does
want
to
get
in
bad
with
the
law
there
wo
be
any
stuff
not
until
he
recalls
stutsman
from
callisto
he
paused
in
stood
planted
solidly
on
the
floor
when
stutsman
gets
into
the
game
he
said
all
hell
will
break
loose
he
took
a
deep
breath
but
we
be
ready
for
it
then
if
we
can
get
television
reception
with
this
apparatus
of
ours
asked
greg
what
is
to
prevent
us
from
televising
why
ca
we
send
as
well
as
receive
russ
drew
doodles
on
a
calculation
sheet
we
could
just
something
else
to
work
out
you
must
remember
we
working
in
a
medium
that
would
complicate
matters
a
little
not
like
working
in
three
dimensions
alone
it
would
he
stopped
the
pencil
fell
from
his
finger
and
he
swung
around
slowly
to
face
manning
what
the
matter
now
asked
greg
look
said
russ
excitedly
we
working
in
four
dimensions
and
if
we
televised
through
four
dimensions
what
would
we
get
greg
wrinkled
his
brow
suddenly
his
face
relaxed
you
do
mean
we
can
televise
in
dimensions
do
you
that
what
it
should
work
out
to
declared
russ
he
swung
back
to
the
table
again
picked
up
his
pencil
and
jotted
down
equations
he
looked
up
from
the
sheet
television
he
almost
whispered
something
new
again
commented
greg
i
say
it
new
russ
reached
out
and
jerked
a
calculator
toward
him
rapidly
he
set
up
the
equations
pressed
the
tabulator
lever
the
machine
gurgled
and
chuckled
clicked
out
the
result
bending
over
to
read
it
russ
sucked
in
his
breath
it
working
out
right
he
said
that
mean
new
equipment
lots
of
it
greg
pointed
out
gone
damn
him
who
going
to
help
us
we
do
it
ourselves
said
russ
when
we
the
only
ones
here
we
can
be
sure
there
wo
be
any
leak
it
took
hours
of
work
on
the
math
machines
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
russ
was
certain
of
his
ground
now
we
go
to
work
he
said
gleefully
in
a
week
time
they
had
built
a
triple
televisor
but
simplifications
of
the
standard
commercial
set
gave
them
a
mechanism
that
weighed
little
more
and
was
far
more
efficient
and
accurate
during
the
time
the
work
went
on
they
maintained
a
watch
over
both
the
office
of
spencer
chambers
and
the
laboratory
in
which
herbert
craven
worked
hours
a
day
unseen
unsuspected
they
were
silent
companions
of
the
two
men
during
many
hours
they
read
what
the
men
wrote
read
what
was
written
to
them
heard
what
they
said
saw
how
they
acted
doing
so
the
pair
in
the
high
mountain
laboratory
gained
a
deep
insight
into
the
characters
of
unsuspecting
quarries
both
utterly
ruthless
declared
greg
but
apparently
men
who
are
sincere
in
thinking
that
the
spoils
belong
to
the
strong
strange
almost
outdated
men
you
ca
help
but
like
chambers
he
good
enough
at
heart
he
has
his
pet
charities
he
really
i
believe
wants
to
help
the
people
and
i
think
he
actually
believes
the
best
way
to
do
it
is
to
gain
a
dictatorship
over
the
solar
system
that
ambition
rules
everything
in
his
life
it
has
hardened
him
and
strengthened
him
he
will
crush
ruthlessly
without
a
single
qualm
anything
that
stands
in
his
path
that
why
we
have
a
fight
on
our
hands
craven
seemed
to
be
making
little
progress
they
could
only
guess
at
what
he
was
trying
to
develop
i
think
said
russ
he
working
on
a
collector
field
to
suck
in
radiant
energy
if
he
really
gets
that
it
will
be
something
worth
having
for
hours
craven
sat
an
intent
untidy
unkempt
man
sunk
deep
in
the
cushions
of
an
easy
chair
his
face
was
calm
with
relaxed
jaw
and
eyes
that
seemed
vacant
but
each
time
he
would
rouse
himself
from
the
chair
to
pencil
new
notations
on
the
pads
of
paper
that
littered
his
desk
new
ideas
new
approaches
the
triple
televisor
was
completed
except
for
one
thing
sound
is
so
easy
said
russ
if
we
could
only
find
a
way
to
transmit
it
as
well
as
light
listen
said
greg
why
do
you
try
a
condenser
speaker
a
condenser
speaker
sure
the
gadget
developed
way
back
in
the
it
has
been
used
for
years
to
my
knowledge
but
it
might
do
the
trick
russ
grinned
broadly
hell
why
did
i
think
of
that
here
i
been
racking
my
brain
for
a
new
approach
a
new
wrinkle
and
exactly
what
i
wanted
was
at
hand
should
work
declared
greg
just
the
opposite
of
a
condenser
microphone
instead
of
radiating
sound
waves
mechanically
it
radiates
a
changing
electric
field
and
this
field
becomes
audible
directly
within
the
ear
even
yet
no
one
seems
to
understand
just
how
it
works
but
it
does
and
that
good
enough
i
know
said
russ
it
really
makes
no
sound
in
other
words
it
creates
an
electric
field
that
doubles
for
sound
it
ought
to
be
just
the
thing
because
nothing
can
stop
it
metal
shielding
can
i
guess
if
it
thick
enough
but
it
got
to
be
pretty
damn
thick
it
took
time
to
set
the
mechanism
up
ready
the
massive
apparatus
within
which
glowed
a
larger
and
more
powerful
force
field
was
operated
by
two
monstrous
material
energy
engines
the
controls
were
equipped
with
clockwork
drives
designed
so
that
the
motion
of
the
earth
could
be
nullified
completely
and
automatically
for
work
upon
outlying
planets
russ
stood
back
and
looked
at
it
stand
in
front
of
that
screen
greg
he
said
and
we
try
it
on
you
greg
stepped
in
front
of
the
screen
the
purr
of
power
came
on
suddenly
materializing
out
of
the
air
came
greg
projection
hazy
and
undefined
at
first
it
rapidly
assumed
apparent
solidity
greg
waved
his
arm
the
image
moved
its
arm
russ
left
the
controls
and
walked
across
the
laboratory
to
inspect
the
image
examined
from
all
sides
it
looked
solid
russ
walked
through
it
and
felt
nothing
there
was
nothing
there
it
was
just
a
image
but
even
from
two
feet
away
it
was
as
if
the
man
himself
stood
there
in
all
the
actuality
of
flesh
and
blood
hello
russ
the
image
whispered
it
held
out
a
hand
glad
to
see
you
again
laughing
russ
thrust
out
his
hand
it
closed
on
nothing
in
but
the
two
men
appeared
to
shake
hands
they
tested
the
machine
that
afternoon
their
images
strode
above
the
trees
apparently
walking
on
thin
air
gigantic
replicas
of
greg
stood
on
a
faraway
mountain
top
and
shouted
with
a
thunderous
voice
smaller
images
no
more
than
two
inches
high
shinnied
up
a
table
leg
satisfied
they
shut
off
the
machine
that
one
of
the
possibilities
you
mentioned
suggested
russ
greg
nodded
grimly
an
autumn
gale
pelted
the
windows
with
driving
rain
and
a
wild
wet
wind
howled
through
the
pines
outside
the
fire
was
leaping
and
flaring
in
the
fireplace
deep
in
his
chair
russ
stared
into
the
flame
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
the
factory
wants
more
money
on
the
spaceship
said
greg
from
the
other
chair
i
had
to
put
up
some
more
shares
as
collateral
on
a
new
loan
market
still
going
down
asked
russ
not
the
market
replied
greg
my
stocks
all
of
them
hit
new
lows
today
russ
dragged
at
the
pipe
thoughtfully
i
been
thinking
about
that
stock
business
greg
so
have
i
but
it
does
seem
to
do
much
good
look
said
russ
slowly
what
planets
have
exchanges
all
of
them
except
mercury
the
jovian
exchange
is
at
ranthoor
even
one
out
at
pluto
just
mining
and
chemical
shares
listed
though
russ
did
not
reply
smoke
curled
up
from
his
pipe
he
was
staring
into
the
fire
why
do
you
ask
greg
wanted
to
know
just
something
stirring
around
in
my
mind
i
was
wondering
where
chambers
does
most
of
his
trading
ranthoor
now
said
greg
used
to
do
it
on
venus
the
listing
is
larger
there
but
since
he
took
over
the
jovian
confederacy
he
switched
his
business
to
it
the
transaction
tax
is
lower
he
saw
to
that
and
the
same
shares
are
listed
on
the
callisto
market
as
on
the
new
york
boards
naturally
said
greg
only
not
as
many
russ
watched
the
smoke
from
his
pipe
how
long
does
it
take
light
to
travel
from
callisto
to
earth
why
about
minutes
i
guess
somewhere
around
there
greg
sat
upright
say
what
light
got
to
do
with
this
a
lot
said
russ
all
commerce
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
light
is
instantaneous
but
it
is
all
business
anywhere
throughout
the
solar
system
is
based
on
greenwich
time
when
a
noon
signal
sent
out
from
earth
reaches
mars
it
noon
there
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
actually
minutes
or
so
past
noon
when
the
same
signal
reaches
callisto
the
correct
time
for
the
chronometer
used
in
commerce
would
be
noon
when
it
is
really
a
quarter
to
one
that
system
simplifies
things
does
away
with
varying
times
and
it
has
worked
all
right
so
far
because
there
has
been
up
to
now
nothing
that
could
go
faster
than
light
no
news
can
travel
through
space
no
message
no
signal
can
be
sent
at
any
speed
greater
than
that
so
everything
has
been
fine
greg
had
come
out
of
the
chair
was
standing
on
his
feet
the
glow
of
the
blaze
throwing
his
athletic
figure
into
bold
relief
that
calm
exterior
had
been
stripped
from
him
now
he
was
excited
i
see
what
you
are
getting
at
we
have
something
that
is
almost
instantaneous
almost
said
russ
not
quite
there
a
time
lag
somewhere
but
it
is
noticeable
except
over
vast
distances
but
it
would
beat
ordinary
light
signals
to
callisto
it
would
beat
them
there
by
almost
minutes
almost
russ
agreed
maybe
a
split
second
less
greg
strode
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
fireplace
like
a
caged
lion
by
heaven
he
said
we
got
chambers
where
we
want
him
we
can
beat
the
stock
quotations
to
callisto
with
that
advance
knowledge
of
what
the
board
is
doing
in
new
york
we
can
make
back
every
dime
i
lost
we
can
take
mr
chambers
to
the
cleaners
russ
grinned
exactly
he
said
we
know
minutes
in
advance
of
the
other
traders
what
the
market
will
be
let
see
chambers
beat
that
ben
wrail
was
taking
things
easy
stretched
out
in
his
chair
with
his
cigar
lit
and
burning
satisfactorily
he
listened
to
a
radio
program
broadcast
from
earth
through
the
window
beside
him
he
could
look
out
of
his
skyscraper
apartment
over
the
domed
city
of
ranthoor
looming
in
the
sky
slightly
distorted
by
the
heavy
quartz
of
the
distant
dome
was
massive
jupiter
a
scarlet
ball
tinged
with
orange
and
yellow
overwhelmingly
luminous
monstrously
large
it
filled
a
large
portion
of
the
visible
sky
a
sight
that
brought
millions
of
tourists
to
the
jovian
moons
each
year
a
sight
that
even
the
still
must
stare
at
drawn
by
some
unfathomable
fascination
ben
wrail
stared
at
it
now
puffing
at
his
cigar
listening
to
the
radio
an
thing
a
looming
planet
that
seemed
almost
ready
to
topple
and
crash
upon
this
airless
frigid
world
wrail
was
an
for
thirty
years
earth
years
he
had
made
his
home
in
ranthoor
he
had
seen
the
city
grow
from
a
dinky
little
mining
camp
enclosed
by
a
small
dome
to
one
that
boasted
half
a
million
population
the
dome
that
now
covered
the
city
was
the
fourth
one
four
times
like
the
nautilus
the
city
had
outgrown
its
shell
until
today
it
was
the
greatest
domed
city
in
the
solar
system
where
life
had
once
been
cheap
and
where
the
scum
of
the
system
had
held
rendezvous
he
had
seen
ranthoor
grow
into
a
city
of
dignity
capital
of
the
jovian
confederacy
he
had
helped
build
that
confederacy
had
been
elected
a
member
of
the
constitution
commission
had
helped
create
the
government
and
for
over
a
decade
had
helped
to
make
its
laws
but
now
ben
wrail
spat
angrily
and
stuffed
the
cigar
back
in
his
mouth
again
taking
a
fresh
and
fearsome
grip
now
everything
had
changed
the
jovian
worlds
today
were
held
in
bond
by
spencer
chambers
the
government
was
in
the
hands
of
his
henchmen
duly
elected
of
course
but
in
an
election
held
under
the
unspoken
threat
that
interplanetary
power
would
withdraw
leaving
the
moons
circling
the
great
planet
without
heat
air
energy
for
the
worlds
of
the
jovian
confederacy
every
single
one
of
them
depended
for
their
life
upon
the
accumulators
freighted
outward
from
the
sun
talk
of
revolt
was
in
the
air
but
lacking
a
leader
it
would
get
nowhere
john
moore
mallory
was
imprisoned
on
one
of
the
prison
spaceships
that
plied
through
the
solar
system
mallory
months
ago
had
been
secretly
transferred
from
the
callisto
prison
to
the
spaceship
but
in
a
week
time
the
secret
had
been
spread
in
angry
whispers
if
there
had
been
riots
and
bloodshed
they
would
have
been
to
no
purpose
for
revolution
even
if
successful
would
gain
nothing
it
would
merely
goad
interplanetary
power
into
withdrawing
refusing
to
service
the
domed
cities
on
the
moons
ben
wrail
stirred
restlessly
in
his
chair
the
cigar
had
gone
out
the
radio
program
blared
unheard
his
eyes
still
looked
out
the
window
without
seeing
jupiter
damn
said
ben
wrail
why
did
he
have
to
go
and
spoil
an
evening
thinking
about
this
damned
political
situation
despite
his
part
in
the
building
of
the
confederacy
he
was
a
businessman
not
a
politician
still
it
hurt
to
see
something
torn
down
that
he
had
helped
to
build
though
he
knew
that
every
pioneering
strike
in
history
had
been
taken
over
by
shrewd
ruthless
powerful
operators
knowing
that
should
have
helped
but
it
did
he
and
the
other
jovian
pioneers
had
hoped
it
would
happen
and
of
course
it
had
ben
wrail
said
a
voice
in
the
room
wrail
swung
around
away
from
the
window
manning
he
yelled
and
the
man
in
the
center
of
the
room
grinned
bleakly
at
him
how
did
you
come
in
without
me
hearing
you
when
did
you
get
here
i
not
here
said
greg
i
back
on
earth
you
what
asked
wrail
blankly
that
a
pretty
silly
statement
is
it
manning
or
did
you
decide
to
loosen
up
and
pull
a
gag
now
and
then
i
mean
it
said
manning
this
is
just
an
image
of
me
my
body
is
back
on
earth
you
mean
you
dead
you
a
ghost
the
grin
widened
but
the
face
was
bleak
as
ever
no
ben
i
just
alive
as
you
are
let
me
explain
this
is
a
television
image
of
me
television
i
can
travel
anywhere
like
this
wrail
sat
down
in
the
chair
again
i
do
suppose
there
be
any
use
trying
to
shake
hands
with
you
no
use
agreed
manning
image
there
is
any
hand
nor
asking
you
to
have
a
chair
manning
shook
his
head
anyhow
said
wrail
i
damn
glad
to
see
you
or
think
i
see
you
i
do
know
which
figure
you
can
stay
and
talk
with
me
a
while
certainly
said
manning
that
is
what
i
came
for
i
want
to
ask
your
help
listen
declared
wrail
you
ca
be
on
earth
manning
i
say
something
to
you
and
you
answer
right
back
that
is
possible
you
ca
hear
anything
i
say
until
minutes
after
i
say
it
and
then
have
to
wait
another
minutes
to
hear
your
answer
that
right
agreed
the
image
if
you
insist
upon
talking
about
the
velocity
of
light
we
have
something
better
than
that
we
russell
page
and
myself
we
have
a
television
apparatus
that
works
almost
instantaneously
to
all
purposes
so
far
as
the
distance
between
earth
and
callisto
is
concerned
it
is
instantaneous
wrail
jaw
fell
well
i
be
damned
what
have
you
two
fellows
been
up
to
now
a
lot
said
manning
laconically
for
one
thing
we
are
out
to
bust
interplanetary
power
bust
them
wide
open
hear
that
wrail
wrail
stared
in
stupefaction
sure
i
hear
but
i
ca
believe
it
all
right
then
said
manning
grimly
we
give
you
proof
what
could
you
do
ben
if
we
told
you
what
was
happening
on
the
stock
market
in
new
york
you
having
to
wait
the
minutes
it
takes
the
quotations
to
get
wrail
sprang
to
his
feet
what
could
i
do
why
i
could
run
the
pants
off
every
trader
in
the
exchange
i
could
make
a
billion
a
minute
he
stopped
and
looked
at
the
image
but
this
is
like
you
this
the
way
you
do
things
i
do
want
you
to
hurt
anyone
but
chambers
said
manning
if
somebody
else
gets
in
the
way
of
course
they
have
to
take
the
rap
along
with
him
but
i
do
want
to
give
chambers
a
licking
that
what
i
came
here
to
see
you
about
by
heaven
greg
i
do
it
said
wrail
he
stepped
quickly
forward
held
out
his
hand
to
close
the
deal
and
encountered
only
air
manning
image
threw
back
its
head
and
laughed
that
your
proof
ben
good
enough
i
say
it
is
said
wrail
shakily
looking
down
at
the
hand
that
his
own
had
gone
right
through
november
was
a
day
long
remembered
in
financial
circles
throughout
the
solar
system
the
ranthoor
market
opened
easy
with
little
activity
then
a
few
stocks
made
fractional
gains
mining
dropped
fractionally
martian
irrigation
still
was
unexplainably
low
as
was
pluto
chemical
and
asteroid
mining
trading
through
two
brokers
ben
wrail
bought
shares
of
venus
farms
when
the
market
opened
at
a
few
minutes
later
they
bought
shares
of
spacesuits
at
the
farm
stocks
dropped
off
a
point
spacesuits
gained
a
point
then
suddenly
both
rose
in
the
second
hour
of
trading
the
venus
stocks
had
boomed
a
full
five
points
and
wrail
sold
ten
minutes
later
they
sagged
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
were
off
two
points
from
the
opening
in
late
afternoon
wrail
threw
his
shares
of
spacesuits
on
the
market
sold
them
at
an
even
before
the
close
they
had
dropped
back
with
a
gain
of
only
half
a
point
over
the
opening
those
were
only
two
transactions
there
were
others
spaceship
fabrication
climbed
three
points
before
it
fell
and
wrail
cashed
in
on
that
mercury
metals
rose
two
points
and
crashed
back
to
close
with
a
full
point
loss
wrail
sold
just
before
the
break
he
had
realized
a
cool
half
million
in
the
day
trade
the
next
day
it
was
a
million
and
then
the
man
who
had
always
been
a
safe
trader
who
had
always
played
the
conservative
side
of
the
market
apparently
sure
of
his
ground
now
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
it
was
uncanny
wrail
knew
when
to
buy
and
when
to
sell
other
traders
watched
closely
followed
his
lead
he
threw
them
off
by
using
different
brokers
to
disguise
his
transactions
hectic
day
followed
hectic
day
ben
wrail
did
not
appear
on
the
floor
calls
to
his
office
netted
exactly
nothing
wrail
was
not
in
so
sorry
his
brokers
well
paid
were
they
bought
and
sold
that
was
all
seated
in
his
office
ben
wrail
was
busy
watching
two
television
screens
before
him
one
showed
the
board
in
the
new
york
exchange
in
the
other
was
the
image
of
gregory
manning
hunched
in
a
chair
in
page
mountain
laboratory
back
on
earth
and
before
greg
likewise
were
two
screens
one
showing
the
new
york
exchange
board
the
other
trained
on
ben
office
that
tourist
stuff
looks
good
said
greg
why
not
buy
a
block
of
it
i
happen
to
know
that
chambers
owns
a
few
shares
he
be
dabbling
in
it
ben
wrail
grinned
it
made
a
couple
of
points
has
it
selling
here
for
right
now
in
minutes
it
be
quoted
at
he
picked
up
a
telephone
buy
all
you
can
of
tourist
he
said
right
away
i
tell
you
when
to
sell
get
rid
of
whatever
you
have
in
titan
copper
at
better
let
go
of
your
holdings
of
ranthoor
dome
suggested
greg
beginning
to
slip
i
watch
it
promised
ben
it
may
revive
they
lapsed
into
silence
watching
the
board
in
new
york
you
know
greg
said
ben
finally
i
really
did
believe
all
this
was
true
until
i
saw
those
credit
certificates
materialize
on
my
desk
simple
grunted
greg
this
thing
we
got
can
take
anything
any
place
i
could
reach
out
there
grab
you
up
and
have
you
down
here
in
a
split
second
ben
sucked
his
breath
in
between
his
teeth
i
not
doubting
anything
any
more
you
sent
me
half
a
billion
two
days
ago
it
more
than
doubled
now
he
picked
up
the
phone
again
and
spoke
to
his
broker
on
the
other
end
unload
ranthoor
dome
when
she
reaches
the
real
furor
came
on
the
ranthoor
floor
when
wrail
cornered
titan
copper
striking
swiftly
he
purchased
the
stock
in
huge
blocks
the
shares
rocketed
as
the
exchanges
throughout
the
system
were
thrown
into
an
uproar
under
the
cover
of
the
excitement
he
proceeded
to
corner
spacesuits
spacesuits
zoomed
for
two
days
the
main
exchanges
on
four
worlds
were
in
a
frenzy
as
traders
watched
the
shares
climb
swiftly
operators
representing
interplanetary
power
made
offerings
no
takers
were
reported
the
shares
climbed
within
one
hour
however
the
entire
wrail
holdings
in
both
stocks
were
dumped
on
the
market
the
interplanetary
power
traders
frantic
over
the
prospect
of
losing
control
of
the
two
important
issues
bought
heavily
the
price
plummeted
spencer
chambers
lost
three
billion
or
more
on
the
deal
overnight
ben
wrail
had
become
a
billionaire
many
times
over
greg
manning
added
to
his
own
fortune
we
have
enough
said
greg
we
given
chambers
what
he
had
coming
to
him
let
call
it
off
glad
to
agreed
ben
it
was
just
too
damned
easy
be
seeing
you
ben
i
get
down
to
earth
some
day
come
see
me
when
you
have
a
minute
drop
in
for
an
evening
that
an
invitation
said
greg
it
easy
with
this
stuff
he
reached
out
a
hand
snapped
a
control
the
screens
in
wrail
office
went
dead
wrail
reached
for
a
cigar
lit
it
carefully
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
put
his
feet
on
the
desk
by
heaven
he
said
satisfiedly
i
never
enjoyed
anything
so
much
in
all
my
life
a
giant
cylindrical
hull
of
finest
beryl
steel
the
ship
loomed
in
the
screen
a
mighty
ship
braced
into
absolute
rigidity
by
monster
cross
beams
of
shining
steel
glowing
under
the
blazing
lamps
that
lighted
the
scene
it
towered
into
the
shadows
of
the
factory
dwarfing
the
scurrying
workmen
who
swarmed
over
it
she
a
beauty
said
russ
puffing
at
his
pipe
greg
nodded
agreement
they
working
on
her
day
and
night
to
get
her
finished
we
may
need
it
some
day
and
need
it
in
a
hurry
if
chambers
really
gets
that
machine
of
his
to
rolling
space
will
be
the
only
place
big
enough
to
hide
in
he
chuckled
a
grim
chuckle
deep
in
his
throat
but
we
wo
have
to
hide
long
just
until
we
get
organized
and
then
will
come
the
time
when
we
call
for
the
showdown
chambers
will
have
to
spread
his
cards
russ
snapped
the
television
switch
and
the
screen
went
blank
the
laboratory
suddenly
was
a
place
of
queer
lights
and
shadows
bulging
with
grotesque
machines
with
sprawling
apparatus
a
place
that
hinted
darkly
of
vast
power
and
mighty
forces
the
scientist
sat
up
in
his
chair
we
come
a
long
way
greg
a
long
long
way
we
have
the
greatest
power
man
has
ever
known
we
have
an
almost
incomprehensible
space
drive
we
have
television
and
said
greg
dryly
we
took
chambers
to
the
cleaners
on
the
market
they
sat
in
silence
greg
smelled
the
smoke
from
russ
pipe
mixed
with
the
taint
of
lubricant
and
the
faint
lingering
scent
of
ionized
air
we
must
underrate
chambers
however
he
declared
the
man
made
one
mistake
he
underrated
us
we
ca
repeat
his
mistake
he
is
dangerous
all
the
time
he
will
stop
at
nothing
not
even
murder
he
going
easy
now
said
russ
he
hoping
craven
can
find
something
that
will
either
equal
our
stuff
or
beat
it
but
craven
is
having
any
luck
he
still
driving
himself
on
the
radiation
theory
but
he
seem
to
make
much
headway
if
he
got
it
just
what
would
it
mean
plenty
with
that
he
could
turn
all
radiations
in
space
to
work
the
cosmics
heat
light
everything
space
is
full
of
radiation
if
it
had
been
for
wilson
greg
said
his
voice
a
snarl
we
would
have
to
be
worrying
about
chambers
chambers
would
know
until
we
were
ready
to
let
him
know
wilson
ejaculated
russ
suddenly
leaning
forward
i
had
forgotten
about
wilson
what
do
you
say
we
try
to
find
him
harry
wilson
sat
at
his
table
in
the
martian
club
and
watched
the
exotic
martian
dance
performed
by
girls
smoke
trailed
up
lazily
from
his
drooping
cigarette
as
he
watched
through
squinted
eyes
there
was
something
about
the
dance
that
got
under
wilson
skin
the
music
rose
then
fell
to
whispering
undertones
and
suddenly
unexpectedly
crashed
and
stopped
the
girls
were
running
from
the
floor
a
wave
of
smooth
polite
applause
rippled
around
the
tables
wilson
sighed
and
reached
for
his
wine
glass
he
crushed
the
cigarette
into
a
tray
and
sipped
his
wine
he
glanced
around
the
room
scanning
the
bobbing
painted
faces
of
the
night
the
great
the
the
brokers
and
businessmen
artists
and
writers
and
actors
there
were
others
too
queer
shadows
that
no
one
knew
much
about
or
that
one
heard
too
much
about
the
playboys
and
the
ladies
of
family
and
fortune
correctly
attired
men
gorgeously
sleekly
attired
women
and
harry
wilson
the
waiters
called
him
wilson
he
heard
people
whispering
about
him
asking
who
he
was
his
soul
soaked
it
in
and
cried
for
more
good
food
good
drinks
the
pastels
of
the
walls
the
soft
lights
and
weird
exotic
music
the
cold
but
colorful
correctness
of
it
all
just
two
months
ago
he
had
stood
outside
the
club
a
stranger
in
the
city
a
mechanic
from
a
little
laboratory
a
man
who
was
paid
a
pittance
for
his
skill
he
had
stood
outside
and
watched
his
employers
walk
up
the
steps
and
through
the
magic
doors
he
had
watched
in
bitterness
but
now
the
orchestra
was
striking
up
a
tune
a
blonde
nodded
at
him
from
a
table
solemnly
with
the
buzz
of
wine
in
his
brain
and
its
hotness
in
his
blood
he
returned
the
nod
someone
was
speaking
to
him
calling
him
by
name
he
looked
around
but
there
was
no
one
looking
at
him
now
and
once
again
through
that
flow
of
music
through
the
hum
of
conversation
through
the
buzzing
of
his
own
brain
came
the
voice
cold
and
sharp
as
steel
harry
wilson
it
sent
a
shudder
through
him
he
reached
for
the
wine
glass
again
but
his
hand
stopped
to
the
stem
paused
and
trembled
at
what
he
saw
for
there
was
a
gray
vagueness
in
front
of
him
a
sort
of
shimmer
of
nothingness
and
out
of
that
shimmer
materialized
a
pencil
as
he
watched
in
stricken
terror
the
point
of
the
pencil
dropped
to
the
tablecloth
and
slowly
precisely
it
started
to
move
he
stared
hypnotized
unbelieving
with
the
fingers
of
madness
probing
at
his
brain
the
pencil
wrote
wilson
you
sold
me
out
the
man
at
the
table
tried
to
speak
tried
to
shriek
but
his
tongue
and
throat
were
dry
and
only
harsh
breath
rattled
in
his
mouth
the
pencil
moved
on
mercilessly
but
you
will
pay
no
matter
where
you
go
i
will
find
you
you
can
not
hide
from
me
the
pencil
slowly
lifted
its
point
from
the
table
and
suddenly
was
gone
as
if
it
had
never
been
wilson
eyes
wide
and
filled
with
terrible
fear
stared
at
the
black
words
on
the
cloth
wilson
you
sold
me
out
but
you
will
pay
no
matter
where
you
go
i
will
find
you
you
can
not
hide
from
me
the
music
pulsated
in
the
room
the
hum
of
conversation
ran
like
an
undertone
but
wilson
did
not
hear
his
entire
consciousness
was
centered
on
the
writing
the
letters
and
the
words
that
filled
his
soul
with
dread
something
seemed
to
snap
within
him
the
cold
wind
of
terror
reached
out
and
struck
at
him
he
staggered
from
the
chair
his
hand
swept
the
wine
glass
from
the
table
and
it
shattered
into
chiming
shards
they
ca
do
this
to
me
he
shrieked
there
was
a
silence
in
the
room
a
silence
of
terrible
accusation
everyone
was
staring
at
him
eyebrows
raised
a
waiter
was
at
his
elbow
do
you
feel
ill
sir
and
then
on
unsteady
feet
he
was
being
led
away
behind
him
he
heard
the
music
once
again
heard
the
rising
hum
of
voices
someone
set
his
hat
on
his
head
was
holding
his
coat
the
cold
air
of
the
night
struck
his
face
and
the
doors
sighed
closed
behind
him
i
take
it
easy
going
down
the
step
sir
counseled
the
doorman
an
driver
held
open
the
door
of
the
cab
and
saluted
where
to
sir
wilson
stumbled
in
and
stammered
out
his
address
the
taxi
droned
into
the
traffic
lane
hands
twitching
wilson
fumbled
with
the
key
took
minutes
to
open
the
door
into
his
apartment
finally
the
lock
clicked
and
he
pushed
open
the
door
his
questing
finger
found
the
wall
switch
light
flooded
the
room
wilson
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
he
felt
safe
here
this
place
belonged
to
him
it
was
his
home
his
retreat
a
low
laugh
hardly
more
than
a
chuckle
sounded
behind
him
he
whirled
and
for
a
moment
blinking
in
the
light
he
saw
nothing
then
something
stirred
by
one
of
the
windows
gray
and
vague
like
a
sheet
of
moving
fog
as
he
watched
shrinking
back
against
the
wall
the
grayness
deepened
took
the
form
of
a
man
and
out
of
that
mistiness
a
face
was
etched
a
face
that
had
no
single
line
of
humor
in
it
a
bleak
face
with
the
fire
of
anger
in
the
eyes
manning
shrieked
wilson
manning
he
wheeled
and
sprinted
for
the
door
but
the
gray
figure
moved
too
incredibly
fast
as
if
it
were
vapor
and
barred
his
path
to
the
door
why
are
you
running
away
manning
voice
mocked
certainly
you
are
afraid
of
me
look
wilson
whimpered
i
did
think
of
what
it
meant
i
just
was
tired
of
working
the
way
page
made
me
work
tired
of
the
little
salary
i
got
i
wanted
money
i
was
hungry
for
money
so
you
sold
us
out
said
manning
no
cried
wilson
i
did
think
of
it
that
way
i
did
stop
to
think
think
now
then
said
manning
gravely
think
of
this
no
matter
where
you
are
no
matter
where
you
go
no
matter
what
you
do
i
always
be
watching
you
i
never
let
you
rest
i
never
give
you
a
peace
please
pleaded
wilson
please
go
away
and
leave
me
i
give
you
back
the
money
there
some
of
it
left
you
sold
out
for
twenty
thousand
said
manning
you
could
have
gotten
twenty
million
chambers
would
have
paid
that
much
to
know
what
you
could
tell
him
because
it
was
worth
twenty
billion
wilson
breath
was
coming
in
panting
gasps
he
dropped
his
coat
and
backed
away
the
back
of
his
knees
collided
with
a
chair
and
he
folded
up
sat
down
heavily
still
staring
at
the
gray
mistiness
that
was
a
man
think
of
that
wilson
manning
went
on
sneeringly
you
could
have
been
a
millionaire
maybe
even
a
billionaire
you
could
have
had
all
the
fine
things
these
other
people
have
but
you
only
got
twenty
thousand
what
can
i
do
begged
wilson
the
misty
face
split
in
a
sardonic
grin
i
do
believe
there
anything
left
for
you
to
do
before
wilson
eyes
the
face
dissolved
lost
its
lines
seemed
to
melt
away
only
streaming
swirling
mist
then
a
slight
refraction
in
the
air
and
then
nothing
slowly
wilson
rose
to
his
feet
reached
for
the
bottle
of
whiskey
on
the
table
his
hand
shook
so
that
the
liquor
splashed
when
he
raised
the
glass
to
his
mouth
his
hand
poured
half
the
drink
over
his
white
shirt
front
ludwig
stutsman
pressed
his
thin
straight
lips
together
so
that
the
setup
he
said
across
the
desk
spencer
chambers
studied
the
man
stutsman
was
like
a
wolf
lean
and
cruel
and
vicious
he
even
looked
like
a
wolf
with
his
long
thin
face
his
small
beady
eyes
the
thin
bloodless
lips
but
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
did
always
wait
for
instructions
but
went
ahead
and
used
his
own
judgment
and
in
a
ruthless
sort
of
way
his
judgment
was
always
right
only
as
a
last
resort
cautioned
chambers
do
i
want
you
to
use
the
extreme
measures
you
are
so
fond
of
using
if
they
should
prove
necessary
we
can
always
use
them
but
not
yet
i
want
to
settle
this
thing
in
the
quietest
way
possible
page
and
manning
are
two
men
who
ca
simply
disappear
there
be
a
hunt
an
investigation
an
ugly
situation
i
understand
agreed
stutsman
if
something
should
happen
to
their
notes
if
somebody
could
find
them
perhaps
you
if
you
found
them
on
your
desk
one
morning
the
two
men
measured
one
another
with
their
eyes
more
like
enemies
than
men
working
for
the
same
ends
not
my
desk
snapped
chambers
craven
so
that
craven
could
discover
this
new
energy
whatever
craven
discovers
belongs
to
interplanetary
chambers
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
to
the
window
looked
out
after
a
moment
time
he
turned
and
walked
back
again
sat
down
in
his
chair
leaning
back
he
matched
his
fingertips
his
teeth
flashing
in
a
grin
under
his
mustache
i
do
know
anything
about
what
going
on
he
said
i
do
even
know
someone
has
discovered
material
energy
that
up
to
craven
he
has
to
find
it
both
you
and
craven
work
alone
i
know
nothing
about
either
of
you
stutsman
jaw
closed
like
a
steel
trap
i
always
worked
alone
by
the
way
said
chambers
the
edge
suddenly
off
his
voice
how
are
things
going
in
the
jovian
confederacy
i
trust
you
left
everything
in
good
shape
as
good
as
could
be
expected
stutsman
replied
the
people
are
still
uneasy
half
angry
they
still
remember
mallory
but
mallory
objected
chambers
is
on
a
prison
ship
in
near
mercury
now
i
believe
stutsman
shook
his
head
they
still
remember
him
we
have
trouble
out
there
one
of
these
days
i
would
hate
to
have
that
happen
remarked
chambers
softly
i
would
regret
it
very
much
i
sent
you
out
there
to
see
that
nothing
happened
the
trouble
out
there
wo
be
a
flash
to
this
thing
you
were
telling
me
about
snapped
stutsman
i
leaving
that
in
your
hands
too
chambers
told
him
i
know
you
can
take
care
of
it
stutsman
rose
i
can
take
care
of
it
i
sure
you
can
chambers
said
he
remained
standing
after
stutsman
left
looking
at
the
door
through
which
the
man
had
gone
maybe
it
had
been
a
mistake
to
call
stutsman
in
from
callisto
maybe
it
was
a
mistake
to
use
stutsman
at
all
he
like
a
lot
of
things
the
man
did
or
the
way
he
did
them
brutal
things
slowly
chambers
sat
down
again
and
his
face
grew
hard
he
had
built
an
empire
of
many
worlds
that
could
be
done
with
gentle
methods
and
no
sure
goal
fighting
every
inch
from
planet
to
planet
he
had
used
power
to
gain
power
and
now
that
empire
was
threatened
by
two
men
who
had
found
a
greater
power
that
threat
had
to
be
smashed
it
would
be
smashed
chambers
leaned
forward
and
pressed
a
buzzer
yes
mr
chambers
said
a
voice
in
the
communicator
send
craven
in
commanded
chambers
craven
came
in
slouchily
his
hair
standing
on
end
his
eyes
peering
through
the
glasses
you
sent
for
me
he
growled
taking
a
chair
yes
i
did
said
chambers
have
a
drink
no
and
no
smoke
either
chambers
took
a
long
cigar
from
the
box
on
his
desk
clipped
off
the
end
and
rolled
it
in
his
mouth
i
a
busy
man
craven
reminded
him
puckering
lines
of
amusement
wrinkled
chambers
eyes
as
he
lit
up
watching
craven
you
do
seem
to
be
busy
doctor
he
said
i
only
wish
you
had
something
concrete
to
report
the
scientist
bristled
i
may
have
in
a
few
days
if
you
leave
me
alone
and
let
me
work
i
presume
that
you
are
still
working
on
your
radiation
collector
any
progress
not
too
much
you
ca
expect
a
man
to
turn
out
discoveries
to
order
i
working
almost
night
and
day
now
if
the
thing
can
be
solved
solve
it
chambers
glowed
keep
up
the
good
work
but
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
something
else
you
heard
i
suppose
that
i
lost
a
barrel
of
money
on
the
ranthoor
exchange
craven
smiled
a
sardonic
twisting
of
his
lips
i
heard
something
about
it
i
thought
you
had
said
chambers
sourly
if
not
you
would
have
been
the
only
one
who
had
heard
how
ben
wrail
took
chambers
for
a
ride
he
really
took
you
then
commented
craven
i
thought
maybe
it
was
just
one
of
those
stories
he
took
me
but
that
not
what
worrying
me
i
want
to
know
how
he
did
it
no
man
not
even
the
most
astute
student
of
the
market
could
have
foretold
the
trend
of
the
market
the
way
he
did
and
wrail
the
most
astute
it
is
natural
when
a
man
who
has
always
played
the
safe
side
suddenly
turns
the
market
upside
down
even
less
natural
when
he
never
makes
a
mistake
well
demanded
craven
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it
i
a
scientist
i
never
owned
a
share
of
stock
in
my
life
there
an
angle
to
it
that
might
interest
you
said
chambers
smoothly
leaning
back
puffing
at
the
cigar
wrail
is
a
close
friend
of
manning
and
wrail
himself
did
have
the
money
it
took
to
swing
those
deals
somebody
furnished
that
money
manning
asked
craven
what
do
you
think
if
manning
mixed
up
in
it
said
craven
acidly
there
is
anything
any
of
us
can
do
about
it
you
bucking
money
and
genius
together
this
manning
is
no
slouch
of
a
scientist
himself
and
page
is
better
they
a
combination
you
think
they
good
asked
chambers
good
did
they
discover
material
energy
the
scientist
glowered
at
his
employer
that
ought
to
be
answer
enough
yes
i
know
chambers
agreed
irritably
but
can
you
tell
me
how
they
worked
this
market
deal
craven
grimaced
i
can
guess
those
boys
did
stop
with
just
finding
how
to
harness
material
energy
they
probably
have
more
things
than
you
can
even
suspect
they
were
working
with
force
fields
you
remember
when
they
stumbled
onto
the
energy
force
fields
are
something
we
know
much
about
a
man
monkeying
around
with
them
is
apt
to
find
almost
anything
what
are
you
getting
at
my
guess
would
be
that
they
have
a
new
kind
of
television
working
in
the
fourth
dimension
using
time
as
a
factor
it
would
penetrate
anything
nothing
could
stop
it
it
could
go
anywhere
at
a
speed
many
times
the
speed
of
light
almost
instantaneously
chambers
sat
upright
in
his
chair
are
you
about
this
craven
shook
his
head
just
a
guess
i
tried
to
figure
out
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
page
and
manning
and
had
the
things
they
had
that
all
and
what
would
you
do
craven
smiled
dourly
i
be
using
that
television
right
in
this
office
he
said
i
keep
you
and
me
under
observation
all
the
time
if
what
i
think
is
true
manning
is
watching
us
now
and
has
heard
every
word
we
said
chambers
face
was
a
harsh
mask
of
anger
i
do
believe
it
could
be
done
doctor
craven
is
right
said
a
quiet
voice
chambers
swung
around
in
his
chair
and
gasped
greg
manning
stood
inside
the
room
just
in
front
of
the
desk
i
hope
you
do
mind
said
greg
i
been
wanting
to
have
a
talk
with
you
craven
leaped
to
his
feet
his
eyes
shining
three
dimensions
he
whispered
how
did
you
do
it
greg
chuckled
i
have
patented
the
idea
doctor
i
rather
not
tell
you
just
now
you
will
accept
my
congratulations
however
asked
craven
that
generous
of
you
i
really
had
expected
this
much
i
mean
it
said
craven
damned
if
i
do
chambers
was
on
his
feet
leaning
across
the
desk
with
his
hand
held
out
greg
right
hand
came
out
slowly
sorry
i
really
ca
shake
hands
he
said
i
not
here
you
know
just
my
image
chambers
hand
dropped
to
the
desk
stupid
of
me
not
to
realize
that
you
looked
so
natural
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
again
brushed
his
gray
mustache
a
smile
twisted
his
lips
so
you
been
watching
me
off
and
on
greg
said
and
what
is
the
occasion
of
this
visit
asked
chambers
you
could
have
held
a
distinct
advantage
by
remaining
unseen
i
did
entirely
believe
what
craven
told
me
you
know
that
is
the
point
at
all
declared
greg
maybe
we
can
get
to
understand
one
another
so
you
ready
to
talk
business
not
in
the
sense
you
mean
greg
said
i
not
willing
to
make
concessions
but
there
no
reason
why
we
have
to
fight
one
another
why
no
said
chambers
there
no
reason
for
that
i
be
willing
to
buy
your
discovery
i
would
sell
it
to
you
greg
told
him
you
would
why
not
i
prepared
to
pay
for
it
you
pay
the
price
all
right
anything
i
asked
even
if
it
bankrupted
you
then
you
mark
it
down
to
loss
and
scrap
material
energy
and
i
tell
you
why
a
terrible
silence
hung
in
the
room
as
the
two
men
eyed
one
another
across
the
table
you
would
use
it
greg
went
on
because
it
would
remove
the
stranglehold
you
have
on
the
planets
it
would
make
power
too
cheap
it
would
eliminate
the
necessity
of
your
rented
accumulators
the
jovian
moons
and
mars
could
stand
on
their
feet
without
the
power
you
ship
to
them
you
could
make
billions
in
legitimate
profits
selling
the
apparatus
to
manufacture
the
energy
but
you
would
want
that
you
want
to
be
dictator
of
the
solar
system
and
that
is
what
i
intend
to
stop
listen
manning
said
chambers
you
a
reasonable
man
let
talk
this
thing
over
without
anger
what
do
you
plan
to
do
i
could
put
my
material
engines
on
the
market
said
greg
that
would
ruin
you
you
would
move
an
accumulator
after
that
your
interplanetary
stock
would
be
worth
the
paper
it
is
written
on
material
energy
would
wipe
you
out
you
forget
i
have
franchises
on
those
planets
chambers
reminded
him
i
fight
you
in
the
courts
until
hell
froze
over
i
prove
convenience
economy
and
necessity
any
court
in
any
land
on
any
planet
would
rule
for
me
chambers
shook
his
head
not
martian
or
jovian
courts
i
tell
them
to
rule
for
me
and
the
courts
outside
of
earth
do
what
i
tell
them
to
greg
straightened
and
backed
from
the
desk
i
hate
to
ruin
a
man
you
worked
hard
you
built
a
great
company
i
would
be
willing
in
return
for
a
policy
on
your
part
to
hold
up
any
announcement
of
my
material
energy
until
you
had
time
to
get
out
to
save
what
you
could
hard
fury
masked
chambers
face
you
never
build
a
material
energy
engine
outside
your
laboratory
do
worry
about
ruining
me
i
allow
you
to
stand
in
my
way
i
hope
you
understand
i
understand
too
well
but
even
if
you
are
a
dictator
out
on
mars
and
venus
even
if
you
do
own
mercury
and
boss
the
jovian
confederacy
you
just
a
man
to
me
a
man
who
stands
for
things
that
i
do
like
greg
stopped
and
his
eyes
were
like
ice
crystals
you
talked
to
stutsman
today
he
said
if
i
were
you
i
would
let
stutsman
do
anything
rash
russ
page
and
i
might
have
to
fight
back
mockery
tinged
chambers
voice
am
i
to
take
this
as
a
declaration
of
war
mr
manning
take
it
any
way
you
like
greg
said
i
came
here
to
give
you
a
proposition
and
you
tell
me
you
going
to
smash
me
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
chambers
is
this
when
you
get
ready
to
smash
me
you
better
have
a
deep
dark
hole
all
picked
out
for
yourself
to
hide
in
because
i
hand
you
back
just
double
anything
you
hand
out
one
of
us
will
have
to
watch
all
the
time
greg
told
russ
we
take
any
chances
stutsman
will
try
to
reach
us
sooner
or
later
and
we
have
to
be
ready
for
him
he
glanced
at
the
new
radar
screen
they
had
set
up
that
morning
beside
the
bank
of
other
controls
any
ship
coming
within
a
hundred
miles
of
the
laboratory
would
be
detected
instantly
and
pinpointed
the
board
flashed
now
in
the
screen
they
saw
a
huge
passenger
ship
spearing
down
toward
the
airport
south
of
them
with
the
port
that
close
said
russ
we
get
a
lot
of
signals
i
ordered
the
belgium
factory
to
rush
work
on
the
ship
said
greg
but
it
will
be
a
couple
of
weeks
yet
we
just
have
to
sit
tight
and
wait
as
soon
as
we
have
the
ship
we
start
in
on
chambers
but
until
we
get
the
ship
we
just
have
to
dig
in
and
stay
on
the
defensive
he
studied
the
scene
in
the
screen
the
ship
had
leveled
off
was
banking
in
to
the
port
his
eyes
turned
away
took
in
the
laboratory
with
its
crowding
mass
of
machinery
we
do
want
to
fool
ourselves
about
chambers
he
said
he
may
not
have
the
power
here
on
earth
that
he
does
on
the
other
planets
but
got
plenty
feeling
the
way
he
does
he
try
to
finish
us
off
in
a
hurry
now
russ
reached
out
to
the
table
that
stood
beside
the
bank
of
controls
and
picked
up
a
small
complicated
mechanism
its
face
bore
nine
dials
with
the
needles
on
three
of
them
apparently
registering
the
other
six
motionless
what
is
that
asked
greg
a
mechanical
detective
said
russ
a
sort
of
mechanical
shadow
while
you
were
busy
with
the
stock
market
stunt
i
made
several
of
them
one
for
wilson
and
another
for
chambers
and
still
another
for
craven
he
hoisted
and
lowered
the
one
in
his
hand
this
one
is
for
stutsman
a
shadow
asked
greg
do
you
mean
that
thing
will
trail
stutsman
not
only
trail
him
said
russ
it
will
find
him
wherever
he
may
be
some
object
every
person
wears
or
carries
is
made
of
iron
or
some
other
magnetic
metal
this
contains
a
tiny
bit
of
that
ridiculous
military
decoration
that
stutsman
never
allows
far
away
from
him
find
that
decoration
and
you
find
stutsman
in
another
one
i
have
a
chunk
of
wilson
belt
buckle
that
college
buckle
you
know
that
he
so
proud
of
chambers
has
a
ring
made
of
a
piece
of
meteoric
iron
and
that
the
bait
for
another
machine
have
a
tiny
piece
off
craven
spectacles
in
his
machine
it
was
easy
to
get
the
stuff
the
force
field
enables
a
man
to
reach
out
and
take
anything
he
wants
to
from
a
massive
machine
to
a
microscopic
bit
of
matter
it
was
a
cinch
to
get
the
stuff
i
needed
russ
chuckled
and
put
the
machine
back
on
the
table
he
gestured
toward
it
it
maintains
a
tiny
field
similar
to
our
television
field
he
explained
but
it
modified
along
a
special
derivation
with
a
magnetic
result
it
can
follow
and
find
the
original
mass
of
any
metallic
substance
it
may
contain
clever
commented
greg
russ
lit
his
pipe
puffed
comfortably
we
needed
something
like
that
the
red
light
on
the
board
snapped
on
and
blinked
russ
reached
out
and
slammed
home
the
lever
twirled
dials
it
was
only
another
passenger
ship
they
relaxed
but
not
too
much
i
wonder
what
he
up
to
said
russ
stutsman
car
had
stopped
in
the
dock
section
of
new
york
crumbling
rotting
piers
and
old
tumbledown
warehouses
deserted
and
unused
since
the
last
ship
sailed
the
ocean
before
giving
way
to
air
commerce
loomed
darkly
like
grim
ghosts
in
the
darkness
stutsman
had
gotten
out
of
the
car
and
said
wait
here
yes
sir
said
the
voice
of
the
driver
stutsman
strode
away
down
a
dark
street
the
televisor
kept
pace
with
him
and
on
the
screen
he
could
be
seen
as
a
darker
shape
moving
among
the
shadows
of
that
old
almost
forgotten
section
of
the
solar
greatest
city
another
shadow
detached
itself
from
the
darkness
of
the
street
shuffled
toward
stutsman
sir
said
a
whining
voice
i
have
eaten
there
was
a
swift
movement
as
stutsman
stick
lashed
out
a
thud
as
it
connected
with
the
second
shadow
head
the
shadow
crumpled
on
the
pavement
stutsman
strode
on
greg
sucked
in
his
breath
he
is
very
sociable
tonight
stutsman
ducked
into
an
alley
where
even
deeper
darkness
lay
russ
with
a
delicate
adjustment
slid
the
televisor
along
closer
to
stutsman
determined
not
to
lose
sight
of
him
for
an
instant
the
man
suddenly
turned
into
a
doorway
so
black
that
nothing
could
be
seen
sounds
of
sharp
impatient
rappings
came
out
of
the
screen
as
stutsman
struck
the
door
with
his
stick
brilliant
illumination
sprang
out
over
the
doorway
but
stutsman
seemed
not
to
see
it
went
on
knocking
the
colors
on
the
screen
were
peculiarly
distorted
grunted
greg
whoever
he
calling
on
wants
to
have
a
good
look
before
letting
anybody
in
the
door
creaked
open
and
a
shaft
of
normal
light
spewed
out
into
the
street
turning
its
murkiness
to
pallid
yellow
stutsman
stepped
inside
the
man
at
the
door
jerked
his
head
back
room
he
said
the
televisor
slid
through
the
door
into
the
lighted
room
behind
stutsman
dust
lay
thick
on
the
woodwork
and
floors
patches
of
plaster
had
broken
away
furrows
zigzagged
across
the
floor
marking
the
path
of
heavy
boxes
or
furniture
which
had
been
pushed
along
in
utter
disdain
of
the
flooring
cheap
hung
in
tatters
from
the
walls
streaked
with
water
from
some
broken
pipe
but
the
back
room
was
a
startling
contrast
to
the
first
rich
comfortable
furniture
filled
it
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
rug
and
hangings
colorfully
painted
hid
the
walls
a
man
sat
under
a
lamp
reading
a
newspaper
he
rose
to
his
feet
like
the
sudden
uncoiling
of
springs
russ
gasped
that
face
was
one
of
the
best
known
faces
in
the
entire
solar
system
a
ratlike
face
with
cruel
cunning
printed
on
it
that
had
been
on
front
pages
and
tv
screens
often
but
never
for
pay
scorio
whispered
russ
greg
nodded
and
his
lips
were
drawn
tight
stutsman
said
scorio
surprised
you
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
was
expecting
come
in
have
a
chair
make
yourself
comfortable
stutsman
snorted
this
is
a
social
call
i
did
figure
it
was
replied
the
gangster
but
sit
down
anyway
gingerly
stutsman
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
hunched
forward
scorio
resumed
his
seat
and
waited
i
have
a
job
for
you
stutsman
announced
bluntly
fine
it
is
often
you
have
one
for
me
years
ago
it
we
may
be
watched
warned
stutsman
the
mobster
started
from
his
chair
his
eyes
darting
about
the
room
stutsman
grunted
disgustedly
if
we
watched
there
is
anything
we
can
do
about
it
we
ca
huh
snarled
the
gangster
why
not
because
the
watcher
is
on
the
west
coast
we
ca
reach
him
if
watching
he
can
see
every
move
we
make
hear
every
word
we
say
who
is
it
greg
manning
or
russ
page
said
stutsman
you
heard
of
them
sure
i
heard
of
them
they
have
a
new
kind
of
television
said
stutsman
they
can
see
and
hear
everything
that
happening
on
earth
perhaps
in
all
the
solar
system
but
i
do
think
they
watching
us
now
craven
has
a
machine
that
can
detect
their
televisor
it
registers
certain
field
effects
they
use
they
were
watching
when
i
left
craven
laboratory
just
a
few
minutes
ago
they
may
have
picked
me
up
since
but
i
do
think
so
so
craven
has
made
a
detector
said
greg
calmly
he
can
tell
when
we
watching
now
he
a
clever
cuss
agreed
russ
take
a
look
at
that
machine
now
urged
scorio
see
if
watching
you
should
have
come
here
you
should
have
let
me
know
and
i
would
have
met
you
some
place
i
ca
have
people
knowing
where
my
hideout
is
quiet
down
snapped
stutsman
i
have
got
the
machine
it
weighs
half
a
ton
scorio
sank
deeper
into
his
chair
worried
do
you
want
to
take
a
chance
and
talk
business
certainly
that
why
i
here
this
is
the
proposition
manning
and
page
are
working
in
a
laboratory
out
on
the
west
coast
in
the
mountains
i
give
you
the
exact
location
later
they
have
some
papers
we
want
we
would
mind
if
something
happened
to
the
laboratory
it
might
for
example
blow
up
but
we
want
the
papers
first
scorio
said
nothing
his
face
was
quiet
and
cunning
give
me
the
papers
said
stutsman
and
i
see
that
you
get
to
any
planet
you
want
to
and
i
give
you
two
hundred
thousand
in
interplanetary
credit
certificates
give
me
proof
that
the
laboratory
blew
up
or
melted
down
or
something
else
happened
to
it
and
i
boost
the
figure
to
five
hundred
thousand
scorio
did
not
move
a
muscle
as
he
asked
why
do
you
have
some
of
your
own
mob
do
this
job
because
i
ca
be
connected
with
it
in
any
way
said
stutsman
if
you
slip
up
and
something
happens
i
wo
be
able
to
do
a
thing
for
you
that
why
the
price
is
high
the
gangster
eyes
slitted
if
the
papers
are
worth
that
much
to
you
why
would
they
be
worth
as
much
to
me
they
would
be
worth
a
dime
to
you
why
not
because
you
could
read
them
said
stutsman
i
can
read
retorted
the
gangster
not
the
kind
of
language
on
those
papers
there
are
more
than
two
dozen
people
in
the
solar
system
who
could
read
it
perhaps
a
dozen
who
could
understand
it
maybe
half
a
dozen
who
could
follow
the
directions
in
the
papers
he
leaned
forward
and
jabbed
a
forefinger
at
the
gangster
and
there
are
only
two
people
in
the
system
who
could
write
it
what
the
hell
kind
of
a
language
is
it
that
only
two
dozen
people
could
read
it
is
a
language
really
it
mathematics
oh
arithmetic
no
stutsman
said
mathematics
you
see
you
do
even
know
the
difference
between
the
two
so
what
good
would
the
papers
do
you
scorio
nodded
yeah
you
right
the
express
thundered
through
the
night
a
gigantic
ship
that
rode
high
above
the
earth
far
below
one
could
see
the
dim
lights
of
eastern
europe
harry
wilson
pressed
his
face
against
the
window
staring
down
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
the
tiny
lights
they
were
alone
he
and
the
other
occupants
of
the
ship
alone
in
the
dark
world
that
surrounded
them
but
wilson
sensed
some
other
presence
in
the
ship
someone
besides
the
pilot
and
his
mechanics
up
ahead
the
hostess
and
the
three
stodgy
traveling
men
who
were
his
fellow
passengers
wilson
hair
ruffled
at
the
base
of
his
skull
tingling
with
an
unknown
fear
that
left
him
shaken
a
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
harry
wilson
so
you
are
running
away
just
a
tiny
voice
that
seemed
hardly
a
voice
at
all
it
seemed
at
once
to
come
from
far
away
and
yet
from
very
near
the
voice
with
an
edge
of
coldness
on
it
was
one
he
never
would
forget
he
cowered
in
his
seat
whimpering
the
voice
came
again
did
i
tell
you
that
you
could
run
away
that
no
matter
where
you
went
i
find
you
go
away
wilson
whispered
huskily
leave
me
alone
have
you
hounded
me
enough
no
answered
the
voice
not
enough
not
yet
you
sold
us
out
you
warned
chambers
about
our
energy
and
now
chambers
is
sending
men
to
kill
us
but
they
wo
succeed
wilson
you
ca
hurt
me
said
wilson
defiantly
you
ca
do
anything
but
talk
to
me
you
trying
to
drive
me
mad
but
you
ca
i
wo
let
you
i
not
going
to
pay
any
more
attention
to
you
the
whisper
chuckled
you
ca
argued
wilson
wildly
all
you
can
do
is
talk
to
me
never
done
anything
but
that
you
drove
me
out
of
new
york
and
out
of
london
and
now
you
driving
me
out
of
paris
but
berlin
is
as
far
as
i
will
go
i
wo
listen
to
you
any
more
wilson
whispered
the
voice
look
inside
your
bag
the
bag
wilson
where
you
are
carrying
that
money
that
stack
of
credit
certificates
almost
eleven
thousand
dollars
what
is
left
of
the
twenty
thousand
chambers
paid
you
with
a
wild
cry
wilson
clawed
at
his
bag
snapped
it
open
pawed
through
it
the
credit
certificates
were
gone
you
took
my
money
he
shrieked
you
took
everything
i
had
i
got
a
cent
nothing
except
a
few
dollars
in
my
pocket
you
have
got
that
either
wilson
whispered
the
voice
there
was
a
sound
of
ripping
cloth
as
something
like
a
great
powerful
hand
flung
aside
wilson
coat
tore
away
the
inside
pocket
there
was
a
brief
flash
of
a
wallet
and
a
bundle
of
papers
which
vanished
the
hostess
was
hurrying
toward
him
is
there
something
wrong
they
took
wilson
began
and
stopped
what
could
he
tell
her
could
he
say
that
a
man
half
way
across
the
world
had
robbed
him
the
three
traveling
men
were
looking
at
him
i
sorry
miss
he
stammered
i
really
am
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
he
sat
down
again
shaken
shivering
he
huddled
back
into
the
corner
of
his
seat
his
hands
explored
the
torn
coat
pocket
he
was
stranded
high
in
the
air
somewhere
between
paris
and
berlin
stranded
without
money
without
a
passport
with
nothing
but
the
clothes
he
wore
and
the
few
personal
effects
in
his
bag
fighting
to
calm
himself
he
tried
to
reason
out
his
plight
the
plane
was
entering
the
central
european
federation
and
that
definitely
was
no
place
to
be
without
a
passport
or
without
visible
means
of
support
a
thousand
possibilities
flashed
through
his
mind
they
might
think
he
was
a
spy
he
might
be
cited
for
illegal
entry
he
might
be
framed
by
secret
police
terror
perched
on
his
shoulder
and
whispered
to
him
he
shivered
violently
and
drew
farther
back
into
the
corner
of
the
seat
he
clasped
his
hands
beat
them
against
his
huddled
knees
he
would
cable
friends
back
in
america
and
have
them
identify
him
and
vouch
for
his
character
he
would
borrow
some
money
from
them
just
enough
to
get
back
to
america
but
whom
would
he
cable
and
with
aching
bitterness
in
his
breast
harry
wilson
came
face
to
face
with
the
horrible
realization
that
nowhere
in
the
world
nowhere
in
the
solar
system
was
there
a
single
person
who
was
his
friend
there
was
no
one
to
help
him
he
bowed
his
head
in
his
hands
and
sobbed
his
shoulders
jerking
spasmodically
the
sobs
racking
his
body
the
traveling
men
stared
at
him
unable
to
understand
the
hostess
looked
briskly
helpless
wilson
knew
he
looked
like
a
scared
fool
and
he
care
he
scared
gregory
manning
riffled
the
sheaf
of
credit
certificates
the
wallet
the
passport
and
pile
of
other
papers
that
lay
upon
the
desk
in
front
of
him
that
closes
one
little
incident
he
said
grimly
that
takes
care
of
our
friend
wilson
maybe
you
were
a
bit
too
harsh
with
him
greg
suggested
russell
page
greg
shook
his
head
he
was
a
traitor
the
lowest
thing
alive
he
sold
the
confidence
we
placed
in
him
he
traded
something
that
was
not
his
to
trade
he
did
it
for
money
and
now
i
taken
that
money
from
him
he
shoved
the
pile
of
certificates
to
one
side
now
i
got
this
stuff
he
said
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
we
do
want
to
keep
it
why
not
send
it
to
chambers
suggested
russ
he
will
find
the
passport
and
the
money
on
his
desk
in
the
morning
give
him
something
to
think
about
tomorrow
scorio
snarled
at
the
four
men
i
want
you
to
get
the
thing
done
right
i
do
want
bungling
understand
the
bulky
man
with
the
scar
across
his
cheek
shuffled
uneasily
we
went
over
it
a
dozen
times
we
know
just
what
to
do
he
grinned
at
scorio
but
the
grin
was
lopsided
more
like
a
sneering
grimace
at
one
time
the
man
had
failed
to
a
heat
ray
and
it
had
left
a
neat
red
line
drawn
across
the
right
cheek
nipped
the
end
of
the
ear
all
right
pete
said
scorio
glaring
at
the
man

job

the
heavy
work

just

your
mind
on
it
you

the
two
heaters

grinned
lopsidedly
again

own
kit

this
rig

got
a
real
job

snarled
scorio
two
doors
and
a
safe

do
it

pete
growled
chizzy

top
speed
and
land

the
controls
and

the
big
heater
just
in

pete
max
and
reg
will
go
to
the
lockdoor
reg
will
stay
there
with
the
buzzer
and
three
drums
of
ammunition
he
whirled
on
reg
you
got
that
ammunition
reg
nodded
emphatically
four
drums
of
it
he
said
one
solid
round
in
the
gun
another
drum
of
solid
and
two
explosive
there
a
thousand
rounds
in
each
drum
snapped
scorio
but
they
last
only
a
minute
so
do
your
firing
in
bursts
i
ai
handled
buzzers
all
these
years
without
knowing
something
about
them
there
only
two
men
there
said
scorio
and
they
probably
be
asleep
come
down
with
your
motor
dead
the
lab
roof
is
thick
and
the
plane
landing
on
those
thick
tires

wake
them
but
be
on
your
guard
all
the
time
pete
and
max
will
go
through
the
lockdoor
into
the
laboratory
and
open
the
safe
dump
all
the
papers
and
money
and
whatever
else
you
find
into
the
bags
and
then
get
out
fast
hop
into
the
plane
and
take
off
when
you
clear
of
the
building
turn
the
heaters
on
it
i
want

and
the
men

stuff

even
a
button
unmelted
get
it
sure
chief
said
pete
he
dusted
his
hands
together
now
get
going
beat
it
the
four
men
turned
and
filed
out
of
the
room
through
the
door
leading
to
the
tumbledown
warehouse
where
was
hidden
the
streamlined
metal
ship
swiftly
they
entered
it
and
the
ship
nosed
gently
upward
blasting
out
through
a
broken
frameless
skylight
climbing
up
and
up
over
the
gleaming
spires
of
new
york
back
in
the
room
hung
with
curtains
alone
scorio
lit
a
cigarette
and
chuckled
they
wo
have
a
chance
he
said
who
wo
asked
a
tiny
voice
from
almost
in
front
of
him
why
manning
and
page
said
scorio
and
then
stopped
the
fire
of
the
match
burned
down
and
scorched
his
fingers
he
dropped
it
who
asked
that
he
roared
i
did
said
the
piping
voice
scorio
looked
down
a
man
sat
on
a
matchbox
on
the
desk
who
are
you
the
gangster
shouted
i
manning
said
the
little
man
the
one
you
going
to
kill
you
remember
damn
you
shrieked
scorio
his
hand
flipped
open
a
drawer
and
pulled
out
a
flame
pistol
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
came
up
and
blasted
screwed
down
to
its
smallest
diameter
the
gun
aim
was
deadly
a
straight
lance
of
flame
no
bigger
than
a
pencil
streamed
out
engulfed
the
little
man
bored
into
the
table
top
the
box
of
matches
exploded
with
a
gush
of
red
that
was
a
dull
flash
against
the
blue
blaze
of
the
gun
but
the
figure
of
the
man
stood
the
stood
there
and
waved
an
arm
at
scorio
the
piping
voice
came
out
of
the
heart
of
the
gun
breath
maybe
i
better
get
a
bit
smaller
make
me
harder
to
hit
more
sport
that
way
scorio
finger
lifted
from
the
trigger
the
flame
snapped
off
laboriously
climbing
out
of
the
still
smoking
furrow
left
in
the
oaken
table
top
was
greg
manning
not
more
than
an
inch
tall
now
the
gangster
laid
the
gun
on
the
table
stepped
closer
warily
with
the
palm
of
a
mighty
hand
he
swatted
viciously
at
the
little
figure
i
got
you
now
but
the
figure
seemed
to
ooze
upright
between
his
fingers
calmly
stepped
off
his
hand
onto
the
table
and
now
it
began
to
grow
watching
it
scorio
saw
it
grow
to
six
inches
and
there
it
stopped
what
are
you
he
breathed
i
told
you
said
the
little
image
i
gregory
manning
the
man
you
set
out
to
kill
i
watched
every
move
you
made
and
known
everything
you
planned
but
that
is
possible
protested
scorio
you
out
on
the
west
coast
this
is
some
trick
i
just
seeing
things
you
are
seeing
anything
imaginary
i
really
here
in
this
room
with
you
i
could
lift
my
finger
and
kill
you
if
i
wished
and
maybe
i
should
scorio
stepped
back
a
pace
but
i
not
going
to
said
manning
i
have
something
better
saved
for
you
something
more
appropriate
you
ca
touch
me
look
said
manning
sternly
he
pointed
his
finger
at
a
chair
it
suddenly
grew
cloudy
became
a
wisp
of
trailing
smoke
was
gone
the
gangster
backed
away
eyes
glued
to
the
spot
where
the
chair
had
vanished
look
here
piped
the
little
voice
scorio
jerked
his
head
around
and
looked
the
chair
was
in
manning
hand
a
tiny
chair
but
the
very
one
that
had
disappeared
from
the
room
a
moment
before
watch
out
warned
manning
and
heaved
the
chair
the
tiny
chair
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
then
with
a
rush
it
gathered
speed
grew
larger
in
a
split
second
it
was
a
chair
and
it
was
hurtling
straight
at
the
gangster
head
with
a
strangled
cry
scorio
threw
up
his
arms
the
chair
crashed
into
him
bowled
him
over
now
do
you
believe
me
demanded
manning
scrambling
to
his
feet
scorio
gibbered
madly
for
the
figure
was
growing
he
became
as
large
as
the
average
man
and
then
much
larger
his
head
cleared
the
high
ceiling
by
scant
inches
his
mighty
hands
reached
out
for
the
gangster
scorio
scuttled
away
on
hands
and
knees
yelping
with
terror
powerful
hands
seemed
to
seize
and
lift
him
the
room
was
blotted
out
the
earth
was
gone
he
was
in
a
place
where
there
was
nothing
no
light
no
heat
no
gravitation
for
one
searing
blasting
second
he
seemed
to
be
floating
in
strangely
suspended
animation
then
with
a
jolt
he
became
aware
of
new
surroundings
he
blinked
his
eyes
and
looked
around
he
was
in
a
great
laboratory
that
hummed
faintly
with
the
suggestion
of
terrific
power
that
smelled
of
ozone
and
seemed
filled
with
gigantic
apparatus
two
men
stood
in
front
of
him
he
staggered
back
manning
he
gasped
manning
grinned
savagely
at
him
sit
down
scorio
you
wo
have
long
to
wait
your
boys
will
be
along
any
minute
now
chizzy
crouched
over
the
controls
his
eyes
on
the
navigation
chart
only
the
thin
screech
of
parted
air
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
ship
the
high
scream
and
the
slow
precise
of
cards
as
reg
and
max
played
a
game
of
double
solitaire
with
a
cold
emotionless
precision
the
plane
was
near
the
stratosphere
well
off
the
traveled
air
lanes
it
was
running
without
lights
but
the
cabin
bulbs
were
on
carefully
shielded
pete
sat
in
the
chair
beside
chizzy
his
blank
expressionless
eyes
stared
straight
ahead
i
do
like
this
job
he
complained
why
not
asked
chizzy
page
and
manning
are
the
kind
of
guys
a
fellow
had
ought
to
be
fooling
around
with
they
ai
just
chumps
you
fool
with
characters
like
them
and
you
got
trouble
chizzy
growled
at
him
disgustedly
bent
to
his
controls
straight
ahead
was
a
thin
sliver
of
a
dying
moon
that
gave
barely
enough
illumination
to
make
out
the
great
rugged
blocks
of
the
mountains
like
dark
shadowy
on
a
newly
started
canvas
pete
shuddered
there
was
something
about
the
thin
watery
moonlight
and
those
hills
it
seems
funny
up
here
he
said
hell
growled
chizzy
you
going
soft
in
your
old
age
silence
fell
between
the
two
the
of
the
cards
continued
you
ai
got
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
chizzy
told
pete
this
tub
is
the
safest
place
in
the
world
she
overpowered
a
dozen
times
she
can
outfly
anything
in
the
air
she
rayproof
and
bulletproof
and
bombproof
nothing
can
hurt
us
but
pete
was
listening
that
moonlight
makes
a
man
see
things
funny
things
like
pictures
in
the
night
you
balmy
declared
chizzy
pete
started
out
of
his
seat
his
voice
gurgled
in
his
throat
he
pointed
with
a
shaking
finger
out
into
the
night
look
he
yelled
look
chizzy
rose
out
of
his
seat
and
froze
in
sudden
terror
straight
ahead
of
the
ship
etched
in
silvery
against
the
background
of
the
sky
was
a
grim
and
terrible
face
it
was
as
big
and
hard
as
a
mountain
the
ship
was
silent
now
even
the
whisper
of
the
cards
had
stopped
reg
and
max
were
on
their
feet
startled
by
the
cries
of
pete
and
chizzy
it
manning
shrieked
pete
he
watching
us
chizzy
hand
whipped
out
like
a
striking
snake
toward
the
controls
and
as
he
grasped
them
his
face
went
deathly
white
for
the
controls
were
locked
they
resisted
all
the
strength
he
threw
against
them
and
the
ship
still
bore
on
toward
that
mocking
face
that
hung
above
the
earth
do
something
screamed
max
you
damn
fool
do
something
i
ca
moaned
chizzy
the
ship
is
out
of
control
it
seemed
impossible
that
ship
was
fast
and
tricky
and
it
had
reserve
power
far
beyond
any
possible
need
it
handled
like
a
dream
it
was
tops
in
aircraft
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
some
force
more
powerful
than
the
engines
and
controls
of
the
ship
itself
had
taken
over
manning
got
us
squealed
pete
we
came
out
to
get
him
and
now
he
has
us
instead
the
craft
was
gaining
speed
the
whining
shriek
of
the
air
against
its
plates
grew
thinner
and
higher
listening
one
could
almost
feel
and
hear
the
sucking
of
the
mighty
power
that
pulled
it
at
an
ever
greater
pace
through
the
tenuous
atmosphere
the
face
was
gone
from
the
sky
now
only
the
moon
remained
the
moon
and
the
mountains
far
below
then
suddenly
the
speed
was
slowing
and
the
ship
glided
downward
down
into
the
of
the
mountains
we
falling
yelled
max
and
chizzy
growled
at
him
but
they
were
falling
the
ship
leveled
off
and
floated
suspended
above
a
sprawling
laboratory
upon
a
mountain
top
that
manning
laboratory
whispered
pete
in
tones
the
levers
yielded
unexpectedly
chizzy
flung
the
power
control
over
drove
the
power
of
the
accumulator
bank
all
the
reserve
into
the
engines
the
ship
lurched
but
did
not
move
the
engines
whined
and
screamed
in
torture
the
cabin
interior
was
filled
with
a
blast
of
heat
the
choking
odor
of
smoke
and
hot
rubber
the
heavy
girders
of
the
frame
creaked
under
the
mighty
forward
thrust
of
the
engines
but
the
ship
stood
still
frozen
above
that
laboratory
in
the
hills
chizzy
hauling
back
the
lever
turned
around
pale
his
hand
began
clawing
for
his
heat
gun
then
he
staggered
back
for
there
were
only
two
men
in
the
cabin
with
him
reg
and
max
pete
had
gone
he
just
disappeared
max
jabbered
he
was
standing
there
in
front
of
us
then
all
at
once
he
seemed
to
fade
as
if
he
was
turning
into
smoke
then
he
was
gone
something
had
descended
about
pete
there
was
no
sound
no
light
no
heat
he
had
no
sense
of
weight
it
was
as
if
suddenly
his
mind
had
become
disembodied
seeing
and
hearing
and
awareness
came
back
to
him
as
one
might
turn
on
a
light
from
the
blackness
and
the
eventless
existence
of
a
split
second
before
he
was
catapulted
into
a
world
of
light
and
sound
it
was
a
world
that
hummed
with
power
that
was
ablaze
with
light
a
laboratory
that
seemed
crammed
with
mighty
banks
of
massive
machinery
lighted
by
great
globes
of
creamy
brightness
shedding
an
illumination
white
as
sunlight
yet
shadowless
as
the
light
of
a
cloudy
day
two
men
stood
in
front
of
him
looking
at
him
one
with
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
the
other
with
lines
of
fear
etched
across
his
face
the
smiling
one
was
gregory
manning
and
the
one
who
was
afraid
was
scorio
with
a
start
pete
snatched
his
pistol
from
its
holster
the
sights
came
up
and
lined
on
manning
as
he
pressed
the
trigger
but
the
lancing
heat
that
sprang
from
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
never
reached
manning
it
seemed
to
strike
an
obstruction
less
than
a
foot
away
it
mushroomed
with
a
flare
of
scorching
radiance
that
drove
needles
of
agony
into
the
gangster
body
his
finger
released
its
pressure
and
the
gun
dangled
limply
from
his
hand
he
moaned
with
the
pain
of
burns
upon
his
unprotected
face
and
hands
he
beat
feebly
at
tiny
licking
blazes
that
ran
along
his
clothing
manning
was
still
smiling
at
him
you
ca
reach
me
pete
he
said
you
can
only
hurt
yourself
enclosed
within
a
solid
wall
of
force
that
matter
can
not
penetrate
a
voice
came
from
one
corner
of
the
room
i
bring
chizzy
down
next
pete
whirled
around
and
saw
russell
page
for
the
first
time
the
scientist
sat
in
front
of
a
great
control
board
his
swift
skillful
fingers
playing
over
the
banks
of
keys
his
eyes
watching
the
instrument
and
the
screen
that
slanted
upward
from
the
control
banks
pete
felt
dizzy
as
he
stared
at
the
screen
he
could
see
the
interior
of
the
ship
he
had
been
yanked
from
a
moment
before
he
could
see
his
three
companions
talking
excitedly
frightened
by
his
disappearance
his
eyes
flicked
away
from
the
screen
looked
up
through
the
skylight
above
him
outlined
against
the
sky
hung
the
ship
at
the
nose
and
stern
two
hemispheres
of
radiance
fitted
over
the
metal
framework
like
the
jaws
of
a
powerful
vise
holding
the
craft
immovable
his
gaze
went
back
to
the
screen
again
just
in
time
to
see
chizzy
disappear
it
was
as
if
the
man
had
been
a
mere
figure
chalked
upon
a
board
and
then
someone
had
taken
a
sponge
and
wiped
him
out
russ
fingers
were
flying
over
the
keys
his
thumb
reached
out
and
tripped
a
lever
there
was
a
slight
hum
of
power
and
chizzy
stood
beside
him
chizzy
did
not
pull
his
gun
he
whimpered
and
cowered
within
the
invisible
cradle
of
force
you
yellow
pete
snarled
at
him
but
chizzy
only
covered
his
eyes
with
his
arms
look
boss
said
pete
addressing
scorio
what
are
you
doing
here
we
left
you
back
in
new
york
scorio
did
not
answer
he
merely
glared
pete
lapsed
into
silence
watching
manning
stood
poised
before
the
captives
rocking
back
and
forth
on
his
heels
a
nice
bag
for
one
evening
he
told
russ
russ
grinned
and
stoked
up
his
pipe
manning
turned
to
the
gangster
chief
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
with
these
fellows
we
ca
leave
them
in
those
force
shells
too
long
because
they
die
for
lack
of
air
and
we
ca
let
them
loose
because
they
might
use
their
guns
on
us
listen
manning
scorio
rasped
hoarsely
just
name
your
price
to
let
us
loose
we
do
anything
you
want
manning
drew
his
mouth
down
i
ca
think
of
a
thing
we
just
seem
to
have
any
use
for
you
then
what
in
hell
the
gangster
asked
shakily
are
you
going
to
do
with
us
you
know
said
manning
i
may
be
a
bit
along
some
lines
maybe
i
am
i
just
do
like
the
idea
of
killing
people
for
money
i
do
like
people
stealing
things
other
people
have
worked
hard
to
get
i
do
like
thieves
and
murderers
and
thugs
corrupting
city
governments
taking
tribute
on
every
man
woman
and
child
in
our
big
cities
but
look
here
manning
pleaded
scorio
we
be
good
citizens
if
we
just
had
a
chance
manning
face
hardened
you
sent
these
men
here
to
kill
us
tonight
did
you
well
not
exactly
stutsman
kind
of
wanted
you
killed
but
i
told
the
boys
just
to
get
the
stuff
in
the
safe
and
never
mind
killing
you
i
said
to
them
that
you
were
pretty
good
eggs
and
i
did
like
to
bump
you
off
see
i
see
said
manning
he
turned
his
back
on
scorio
and
started
to
walk
away
the
gangster
chief
came
out
of
his
chair
and
as
he
did
so
russ
reached
out
a
single
finger
and
tapped
a
key
scorio
screamed
and
beat
with
his
fists
against
the
wall
of
force
that
had
suddenly
formed
about
him
that
single
tap
on
the
great
keyboard
had
sprung
a
trap
had
been
the
one
factor
necessary
to
bring
into
being
a
force
shell
already
spun
and
waiting
for
him
manning
did
not
even
turn
around
at
scorio
scream
he
slowly
paced
his
way
down
the
line
of
standing
gangsters
he
stopped
in
front
of
pete
and
looked
at
him
pete
he
said
you
sprung
a
good
many
prisons
have
you
there
ai
a
jug
in
the
system
that
can
hold
me
pete
boasted
and
that
a
fact
i
believe
there
one
that
could
greg
told
him
one
that
no
man
has
ever
escaped
from
or
ever
will
what
that
demanded
pete
the
vulcan
fleet
said
greg
pete
looked
into
the
eyes
of
the
man
before
him
and
read
the
purpose
in
those
eyes
do
send
me
there
send
me
any
place
but
there
greg
turned
to
russ
and
nodded
russ
fingers
played
their
tune
of
doom
upon
the
keyboard
his
thumb
depressed
a
lever
with
a
roar
five
gigantic
material
energy
engines
screamed
with
thrumming
power
pete
disappeared
the
engines
roared
with
thunderous
throats
a
roar
that
seemed
to
drown
the
laboratory
in
solid
waves
of
sound
a
curious
refractive
effect
developed
about
the
straining
hulks
as
space
near
them
bent
under
their
lashing
power
months
ago
russ
and
greg
had
learned
a
better
way
of
transmitting
power
than
by
metal
bars
or
through
conducting
beams
beams
of
such
power
as
were
developing
now
would
have
smashed
atoms
to
protons
and
electrons
through
a
window
in
the
side
of
the
near
engine
greg
could
see
the
iron
ingot
used
as
fuel
dwindling
under
the
sucking
force
the
droning
died
and
only
a
hum
remained
he
in
a
prison
now
he
never
get
out
of
said
greg
calmly
i
wonder
what
they
think
when
they
find
him
dressed
in
civilian
clothes
and
carrying
a
heat
gun
they
clap
him
into
a
and
keep
him
there
until
they
investigate
when
they
find
out
who
he
is
he
wo
get
out
he
has
enough
unfinished
prison
sentences
to
last
a
century
or
two
for
pete
was
on
one
of
the
vulcan
fleet
ships
the
of
the
prison
fleet
there
were
confined
only
the
most
vicious
and
the
most
depraved
of
the
solar
system
criminals
he
would
be
forced
to
work
under
the
flaming
of
a
sun
that
hurled
such
intense
radiations
that
mere
spacesuits
were
no
protection
at
all
the
workers
on
the
vulcan
fleet
ships
wore
suits
that
were
in
reality
which
converted
the
deadly
radiations
into
electric
power
for
electric
power
can
be
disposed
of
where
heat
can
not
quailing
inside
his
force
shell
scorio
saw
his
men
go
one
by
one
saw
them
lifted
and
whisked
away
out
through
the
depths
of
space
by
the
magic
touch
upon
the
keyboards
with
eyes
he
watched
russ
set
up
the
equations
saw
him
trip
the
activating
lever
saw
the
men
disappear
listened
to
the
thunderous
rumbling
of
the
mighty
engines
chizzy
went
to
the
outpost
the
harsh
prison
on
neptune
satellite
reg
went
to
titan
clear
across
the
solar
system
where
men
in
the
infamous
penal
colony
labored
in
the
frigid
wastes
of
that
moon
of
saturn
max
went
to
vesta
the
asteroid
prison
which
long
had
been
the
target
of
reformers
who
claimed
that
on
it
per
cent
of
the
prisoners
died
of
boredom
and
fear
max
was
gone
and
only
scorio
remained
stutsman
the
one
who
got
us
into
this
wailed
the
gangster
the
man
you
want
to
get
not
me
not
the
boys
stutsman
i
promise
you
said
greg
that
we
take
care
of
stutsman
and
chambers
too
chattered
scorio
but
you
ca
touch
chambers
you
would
dare
we
not
worrying
about
chambers
greg
told
him
we
not
worrying
about
anyone
you
the
one
who
had
better
start
doing
some
scorio
cringed
let
me
tell
you
about
a
place
on
venus
said
greg
it
in
the
center
of
a
big
swamp
that
stretches
for
hundreds
of
miles
in
every
direction
it
a
sort
of
mountain
rising
out
of
the
swamp
and
the
swamp
is
filled
with
beasts
and
reptiles
of
every
kind
ravenous
things
lusting
for
blood
but
they
do
climb
the
mountain
a
man
if
he
stayed
on
the
mountain
would
be
safe
there
food
there
roots
and
berries
and
fruits
and
even
small
animals
one
could
kill
a
man
might
go
hungry
for
a
while
but
soon
he
find
the
things
to
eat
but
he
be
alone
no
one
ever
goes
near
that
mountain
i
am
the
only
man
who
ever
set
foot
on
it
perhaps
no
one
ever
will
again
at
night
you
hear
the
screaming
and
the
crying
of
the
things
down
in
swamp
but
you
must
pay
any
attention
to
them
scorio
eyes
widened
staring
you
wo
send
me
you
find
my
campfires
greg
told
him
if
the
rain
has
washed
them
away
it
rains
a
lot
so
much
and
so
drearily
that
you
want
to
leave
that
mountain
and
walk
down
into
the
swamp
of
your
own
free
will
and
let
the
monsters
finish
you
scorio
sat
dully
he
did
not
move
horror
glazed
his
eyes
greg
signed
to
russ
russ
pipe
clenched
between
his
teeth
reached
out
his
fingers
for
the
keys
the
engines
droned
manning
walked
slowly
to
a
television
control
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
flipped
over
a
lever
a
face
stared
out
of
the
screen
it
was
strangely
filled
with
anger
and
a
sort
of
you
watched
it
did
you
stutsman
greg
asked
stutsman
nodded
i
watched
you
ca
get
away
with
it
manning
you
ca
take
the
law
into
your
own
hands
that
way
you
and
chambers
have
been
taking
the
law
into
your
hands
for
years
said
greg
all
i
did
tonight
was
clear
the
earth
of
some
vermin
every
one
of
those
men
was
guilty
of
murder
and
worse
what
did
you
gain
by
it
asked
stutsman
greg
gave
a
bitter
laugh
i
convinced
you
stutsman
he
said
that
it
is
so
easy
to
kill
me
i
think
it
be
some
time
before
you
try
again
better
luck
next
time
he
flipped
the
switch
and
turned
about
in
the
chair
russ
jerked
his
thumb
at
the
skylight
might
as
well
finish
the
ship
now
greg
nodded
an
instant
later
there
was
a
fierce
intolerably
light
that
lit
the
mountains
for
many
miles
for
just
an
instant
it
flared
exploding
into
millions
of
brilliant
harmless
sparks
that
died
into
darkness
before
they
touched
the
ground
the
gangster
ship
was
destroyed
beyond
all
tracing
disintegrated
the
metal
and
quartz
of
which
it
was
made
were
simply
gone
russ
brought
his
glance
back
from
the
skylight
looked
at
his
friend
stutsman
will
do
everything
he
can
to
wipe
us
out
by
tomorrow
morning
the
interplanetary
machine
will
be
rolling
with
only
one
purpose
to
crush
us
that
right
greg
agreed
but
we
ready
for
them
now
our
ship
left
the
belgium
factories
several
hours
ago
the
towed
it
out
in
space
and
it
waiting
for
us
now
in
a
few
hours
the
will
be
here
to
pick
us
up
war
in
space
said
russ
musingly
that
what
it
will
be
chambers
and
his
gang
wo
fight
according
to
any
rules
there
be
no
holds
barred
no
more
feeble
attempts
like
the
one
they
tried
tonight
from
now
on
we
need
a
base
that
simply
ca
be
located
the
ship
said
russ
the
hung
in
space
an
empty
airless
hull
the
largest
thing
afloat
chartered
freighters
leaving
their
ports
from
distant
parts
of
the
earth
had
converged
upon
her
hours
before
had
unloaded
crated
apparatus
storing
it
in
the
yawning
hull
then
they
had
departed
now
the
sturdy
little
was
towing
the
great
ship
out
into
space
miles
beyond
the
orbit
of
the
moon
slowly
the
hull
was
being
taken
farther
and
farther
away
from
possible
discovery
work
on
the
installation
of
the
apparatus
had
started
almost
as
soon
as
the
had
first
tugged
at
the
ponderous
mass
leaving
only
a
skeleton
crew
in
charge
of
the
the
rest
of
the
selected
crew
had
begun
the
assembly
of
the
mighty
machines
which
would
transform
the
into
a
thing
of
unimaginable
power
and
speed
the
doors
were
closed
and
sealed
and
the
air
already
stored
in
the
ship
tanks
was
released
the
slight
acceleration
of
the
towing
served
to
create
artificial
weight
for
easier
work
but
not
enough
to
handicap
the
shifting
of
the
heavier
pieces
of
apparatus
an
electric
cable
was
run
back
from
the
little
yacht
and
the
took
her
first
breath
of
life
the
work
advanced
rapidly
for
every
man
was
more
than
a
mere
engineer
or
spacebuster
they
were
a
selected
crew
the
men
who
had
helped
to
make
the
name
of
gregory
manning
famous
throughout
the
solar
system
first
the
engines
were
installed
then
the
two
groups
of
five
massive
power
plants
and
the
single
smaller
engine
as
an
auxiliary
supply
plant
for
the
light
heat
air
the
accumulators
of
the
were
drained
in
a
single
tremendous
surge
and
the
auxiliary
generator
started
it
in
turn
awoke
to
life
the
other
power
plants
to
leave
them
sleeping
idling
but
ready
for
instant
use
to
develop
power
such
as
man
never
before
had
dreamed
of
holding
and
molding
to
his
will
then
with
the
gigantic
tools
these
engines
supplied
tools
of
pure
force
and
strange
space
fields
the
work
was
rapidly
completed
the
power
boards
were
set
in
place
welded
in
position
by
a
sudden
furious
blast
of
white
hot
metal
and
as
equally
sudden
freezing
to
be
followed
by
careful
heating
and
recooling
till
the
reached
its
maximum
strength
over
the
hull
swarmed
spacesuited
men
using
that
strange
new
power
the
stubborn
metal
in
a
manner
never
before
possible
the
generators
were
charging
the
atoms
of
the
ship
hide
with
the
same
hazy
force
that
had
trapped
and
held
the
gangster
ship
in
a
mighty
vise
thus
charged
no
material
thing
could
penetrate
them
the
greatest
meteor
would
be
crushed
to
drifting
dust
without
so
much
as
scarring
that
wall
of
mighty
force
meteors
traveling
with
a
speed
and
penetrative
power
that
no
projectile
could
ever
hope
to
attain
riding
under
her
own
power
driven
by
the
concentration
of
gravitational
lines
impregnable
to
all

forces
containing
within
her

the
secrets
of
many
strange
devices

russell
page
lounged
in
a
chair
before
the
control
manual
of
the
machine
he
puffed
placidly
at
his
pipe
and
looked
out
through
the
great
sweep
of
the
vision
panel
out
there
was
the
black
of
space
and
the
glint
of
stars
the
soft
glow
of
distant
jupiter
greg
manning
was
hunched
over
the
navigation
controls
sharp
eyes
watching
the
panorama
of
space
russ
looked
at
him
and
grinned
on
greg
face
there
was
a
smile
but
about
his
eyes
were
lines
of
alert
watchfulness
and
thought
greg
manning
was
in
his
proper
role
at
the
controls
of
a
ship
such
as
the
a
man
who
never
stepped
backward
from
danger
whose
spirit
hungered
for
the
vast
stretches
of
void
that
lay
between
the
worlds
russ
leaned
back
blowing
smoke
toward
the
control
room
ceiling
they
had
burned
their
bridges
behind
them
the
laboratory
back
in
the
mountains
was
destroyed
locked
against
any
possible
attack
by
a
sphere
of
force
until
the
had
lifted
from
it
certain
items
of
equipment
it
had
been
melted
into
a
mass
of
molten
metal
that
formed
a
pool
upon
the
mountain
top
that
ran
in
gushing
fiery
ribbons
down
the
mountain
side
flowing
in
gleaming
curtains
over
precipices
it
would
have
been
easier
to
have
merely
disintegrated
in
one
bursting
flash
of
energy
but
that
would
have
torn
apart
the
entire

overwhelmed
and
toppled

hundreds
of

staggering

to

on

again
the

reached
out
wrapped
its
fingers
around
the
men
who
stepped
from
the
little
ship
in
less
than
the
flash
of
a
strobe
light
they
had
been
snatched
back
to
the
through
a
million
miles
of
space
through
the
very
walls
of
the
ship
itself
one
second
they
had
been
on
earth
the
next
second
they
were
in
the
control
room
of
the
grinning
saluting
greg
manning
trotting
back
to
their
quarters
in
the
engine
rooms
russ
stared
out
at
space
puffed
at
his
pipe
considering
a
thousand
years
ago
men
had
held
what
they
called
tournaments
armored
knights
rode
out
into
the
jousting
grounds
and
broke
their
lances
to
prove
which
was
the
better
man
today
there
was
to
be
another
tournament
this
ship
was
to
be
their
charger
and
the
gauntlet
had
been
flung
to
spencer
chambers
and
interplanetary
power
and
all
of
space
was
to
be
the
jousting
grounds
this
was
war
war
without
trappings
without
fanfare
but
bitter
war
upon
which
depended
the
future
of
the
solar
system
a
war
to
break
the
grip
of
steel
that
interplanetary
accumulators
had
gained
upon
the
planets
to
shatter
the
grim
dream
of
empire
held
by
one
man
a
war
for
the
right
to
give
to
the
people
of
the
worlds
a
source
of
power
that
would
forever
unshackle
them
back
in
those
days
a
thousand
years
ago
men
had
built
a
system
of
government
that
historians
called
the
feudal
system
by
this
system
certain
men
were
called
lords
or
barons
and
other
titles
they
held
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
the
men
under
them
this
was
what
spencer
chambers
was
trying
to
do
with
the
solar
system
what
he
would
do
if
someone
did
not
stop
him
russ
bit
viciously
on
his
the
earth
the
solar
system
never
could
revert
to
that
ancient
way
of
government
the
proud
people
spawned
on
the
earth
swarming
outward
to
the
other
planets
must
never
have
to
bow
their
heads
as
minions
to
an
overlord
the
thrum
of
power
was
beating
in
his
brain
the
droning
humming
power
from
the
engine
rooms
that
would
blast
once
and
forever
the
last
threat
of
dictatorship
upon
any
world
the
power
that
would
free
a
people
that
would
help
them
on
and
up
and
outward
to
the
great
destiny
that
was
theirs
and
this
had
come
because
wondering
groping
curiously
he
had
sought
to
heat
a
slender
thread
of
imperm
wire
within
force
field
because
another
man
had
listened
and
had
made
available
his
fortune
to
continue
the
experiments
blind
luck
and
human
curiosity
perhaps
even
the
madness
of
a
human
dream
and
from
those
things
had
come
this
great
ship
this
mighty
power
these
many
bulking
pieces
of
equipment
that
would
perform
wonders
never
guessed
at
less
than
a
year
ago
greg
manning
swiveled
his
chair
well
russ
we
ready
to
begin
let
get
wrail
first
russ
nodded
silently
his
mind
still
half
full
of
fleeting
thought
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
and
pocketed
it
swung
around
to
the
manual
of
the
televisor
his
fingers
reached
out
and
tapped
a
pattern
callisto
appeared
within
the
screen
leaped
upward
at
them
then
the
surface
of
the
frozen
little
world
seemed
to
rotate
swiftly
and
a
dome
appeared
the
televisor
dived
through
the
dome
sped
through
the
city
straight
for
a
penthouse
apartment
ben
wrail
sat
slumped
in
a
chair
a
newspaper
was
crumpled
at
his
feet
in
his
lap
lay
a
mangled
dead
cigar
greg
yelled
russ
greg
there
something
wrong
greg
leaped
forward
stared
at
the
screen
russ
heard
his
smothered
cry
of
rage
in
wrail
forehead
was
a
tiny
neatly
drilled
hole
from
which
a
single
drop
of
blood
oozed
murdered
exclaimed
russ
yes
murdered
said
greg
and
there
was
a
sudden
calmness
in
his
voice
russ
grasped
the
televisor
control
ranthoor
streets
ran
beneath
them
curiously
silent
and
deserted
here
and
there
lay
bodies
a
few
shop
windows
were
smashed
but
the
only
living
that
stirred
was
a
dog
that
slunk
across
the
street
and
into
the
shadows
of
an
alley
swiftly
the
televisor
swung
along
the
streets
straight
into
the
screen
clanked
a
marching
detail
of
government
police
herding
before
them
a
half
dozen
prisoners
the
men
had
their
hands
bound
behind
their
backs
but
they
walked
with
heads
held
high
revolution
gasped
russ
not
a
revolution
a
purge
stutsman
is
clearing
the
city
of
all
who
might
be
dangerous
to
him
this
will
be
happening
on
every
other
planet
where
chambers
holds
control
perspiration
ran
down
russ
forehead
and
dripped
into
his
eyes
as
he
manipulated
the
controls
stutsman
is
striking
first
said
greg
calmly
far
too
calmly
he
consolidating
his
position
possibly
on
the
pretense
that
plots
have
been
discovered
a
few
buildings
were
bombed
a
line
of
bodies
were
crumpled
at
the
foot
of
a
steel
wall
marking
the
spot
where
men
had
been
lined
up
and
mowed
down
with
one
sweeping
blast
from
a
heater
russ
turned
the
television
controls
let
see
about
venus
and
mars
the
scenes
in
ranthoor
were
duplicated
in
sandebar
on
mars
in
new
chicago
the
capital
of
venus
everywhere
stutsman
had
struck
everywhere
the
purge
was
wiping
out
in
blood
every
person
who
might
revolt
against
the
governments
throughout
the
solar
system
violence
was
on
the
march
boots
trampling
the
rights
of
free
men
to
tighten
the
grip
of
interplanetary
in
the
control
room
of
the
the
two
men
stared
at
one
another
there
one
man
we
need
said
greg
one
man
if
he
still
alive
and
i
think
he
is
who
is
that
asked
russ
john
moore
mallory
said
greg
where
is
he
i
do
know
he
was
imprisoned
in
ranthoor
but
stutsman
transferred
him
some
place
else
possibly
to
one
of
the
prison
fleet
if
we
had
the
records
of
the
callisto
prison
suggested
russ
we
could
find
out
if
we
had
the
records
we
get
them
russ
said
he
swung
back
to
the
keyboard
again
a
moment
later
the
administration
offices
of
the
prison
were
on
the
screen
the
two
men
searched
the
vision
plate
the
records
are
most
likely
in
that
vault
said
russ
and
the
vault
is
locked
do
worry
about
the
lock
snapped
greg
just
bring
the
whole
damn
thing
here
vault
and
records
and
all
russ
nodded
grimly
his
thumb
tripped
the
control
and
from
the
engine
rooms
came
a
drone
of
power
in
ranthoor
prison
great
bands
of
force
wrapped
themselves
around
the
vault
clutching
it
enfolding
it
within
a
sphere
of
power
back
in
the
the
engines
screamed
and
the
vault
was
ripped
out
of
the
solid
steel
wall
as
easily
as
a
man
might
rip
a
button
from
his
shirt
john
moore
mallory
sat
on
the
single
metal
chair
within
his
cell
and
pressed
his
face
against
the
tiny
vision
port
for
hours
he
had
sat
there
staring
out
into
the
blackness
of
space
there
was
bitterness
in
john
moore
mallory
soul
a
terrible
and
futile
bitterness
so
long
as
he
had
remained
within
the
ranthoor
prison
there
had
always
been
a
chance
of
escape
but
now
aboard
the
penal
ship
there
was
no
hope
nothing
but
the
taunting
reaches
of
space
the
mocking
pinpoints
of
the
stars
the
hooting
laughter
of
the
engines
sometimes
he
had
thought
he
would
go
mad
the
everlasting
routine
the
meaningless
march
of
hours
the
work
period
the
sleep
period
the
work
period
the
sleep
period
endless
monotony
an
existence
without
a
purpose
men
buried
alive
in
space
john
moore
mallory
said
a
voice
mallory
heard
but
he
did
not
stir
an
awful
thought
crossed
his
mind
now
he
was
hearing
voices
calling
his
name
john
mallory
said
the
voice
again
mallory
slowly
turned
about
and
as
he
turned
he
started
from
his
chair
a
man
stood
in
the
cell
a
man
he
had
never
seen
before
who
had
come
silently
for
there
had
been
no
screech
of
opening
door
you
are
john
moore
mallory
are
you
asked
the
man
yes
i
am
mallory
who
are
you
gregory
manning
gregory
manning
said
mallory
wonderingly
i
heard
of
you
the
man
who
rescued
the
pluto
expedition
but
why
are
you
here
how
did
you
get
in
i
came
to
take
you
away
with
me
said
greg
back
to
callisto
back
to
any
place
you
want
to
go
mallory
flattened
himself
against
the
partition
his
face
white
with
disbelief
but
i
in
a
prison
ship
i
not
free
to
go
and
come
as
i
please
greg
chuckled
you
are
free
to
go
and
come
as
you
please
from
now
on
he
said
even
prison
ships
ca
hold
you
you
mad
whispered
mallory
either
you
mad
or
i
am
you
a
dream
i
wake
up
and
find
you
gone
manning
stood
in
silence
looking
at
the
man
mallory
bore
the
marks
of
prison
on
him
his
eyes
were
haunted
and
his
rugged
face
was
pinched
and
thin
listen
closely
mallory
said
greg
softly
you
are
going
mad
and
i
not
mad
you
are
seeing
things
you
are
hearing
things
actually
talking
to
me
there
was
no
change
in
the
other
face
mallory
greg
went
on
i
have
what
you
always
needed
means
of
generating
almost
unlimited
energy
at
almost
no
cost
the
secret
of
the
energy
of
matter
a
secret
that
will
smash
interplanetary
that
will
free
the
solar
system
from
spencer
chambers
but
i
ca
make
that
secret
available
to
the
people
until
chambers
is
crushed
until
i
sure
that
he
ca
take
it
from
me
and
to
do
that
i
need
your
help
mallory
face
lost
its
expression
of
bewilderment
suddenly
lighted
with
realization
but
his
voice
was
harsh
and
bitter
you
came
too
late
i
ca
help
you
remember
i
in
a
prison
ship
from
which
no
one
can
escape
you
have
to
do
what
you
can
you
must
do
what
you
can
but
i
ca
be
with
you
manning
strode
forward
you
do
get
the
idea
at
all
i
said
i
get
you
out
of
here
and
i
going
to
i
could
pick
up
this
ship
and
put
it
wherever
i
wanted
but
i
do
want
to
i
just
want
you
mallory
stared
at
him
just
do
be
startled
said
greg
something
will
happen
soon
get
ready
for
it
feet
drummed
on
the
metal
corridor
outside
hey
you
pipe
down
yelled
the
voice
of
the
guard
you
know
no
talking
allowed
now
go
to
sleep
that
the
guard
mallory
whispered
fiercely
they
stop
us
greg
grinned
viciously
no
they
wo
the
guard
came
into
view
through
the
grilled
door
so
it
you
mallory
he
began
stopping
in
amazement
hey
you
he
shouted
at
greg
who
are
you
how
did
you
get
in
that
cell
greg
flipped
a
hand
in
greeting
pleasant
evening
is
it
the
guard
grabbed
for
the
door
but
he
did
not
reach
the
bars
some
force
stopped
him
six
inches
away
it
could
not
be
seen
could
not
be
felt
but
his
straining
against
it
accomplished
nothing
mallory
and
i
are
leaving
greg
told
the
guard
we
do
like
it
here
too
stuffy
the
guard
lifted
a
whistle
and
blew
a
blast
feet
pounded
outside
a
prisoner
yelled
from
one
of
the
cells
another
catcalled
instantly
the
ship
was
in
an
uproar
the
convicts
took
up
the
yammering
shaking
the
bars
on
their
doors
let
get
started
greg
said
to
mallory
hold
tight
blackness
engulfed
mallory
he
felt
a
peculiar
twisting
wrench
and
then
he
was
standing
in
the
control
room
of
a
ship
and
gregory
manning
and
another
man
were
smiling
at
him
white
light
poured
down
from
a
cluster
of
globes
somewhere
in
the
ship
engines
purred
with
the
hum
of
power
the
air
was
fresh
and
pure
making
him
realize
how
foul
and
stale
the
air
of
the
prison
ship
had
been
greg
held
out
his
hand
welcome
to
our
ship
mallory
gripped
his
hand
blinking
in
the
light
where
am
i
you
are
on
the
five
million
miles
off
callisto
but
were
you
here
all
the
time
asked
mallory
were
you
in
my
cell
back
there
or
were
you
i
was
really
in
your
cell
greg
assured
him
i
could
have
just
thrown
my
image
there
but
i
went
there
personally
to
get
you
russ
page
here
sent
me
out
when
i
gave
him
the
signal
he
brought
both
of
us
back
i
glad
you
with
us
russ
said
perhaps
you
like
a
cup
of
coffee
something
to
eat
mallory
stammered
why
i
really
would
he
laughed
rations
too
good
in
the
prison
ship
they
sat
down
while
russ
rang
the
galley
for
coffee
and
sandwiches
crisply
greg
informed
mallory
of
the
situation
we
want
to
start
manufacturing
these
engines
as
soon
as
possible
he
explained
but
i
have
even
dared
to
patent
them
chambers
would
simply
buy
out
the
officials
if
i
tried
it
on
earth
delay
the
patent
for
a
few
days
and
then
send
through
papers
copied
from
ours
you
know
what
he
do
with
it
if
he
got
the
patent
rights
he
scrap
it
and
the
old
accumulator
business
would
go
on
as
always
if
i
tried
it
on
any
other
world
with
any
other
government
he
see
that
laws
were
passed
to
block
us
he
probably
instruct
the
courts
to
rule
against
the
manufacture
of
the
engines
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
dangerous
mallory
face
was
grave
there
only
one
answer
he
said
with
the
situation
on
the
worlds
with
this
purge
you
told
me
about
there
only
one
thing
to
do
we
have
to
act
at
once
every
minute
we
wait
gives
stutsman
just
that
much
longer
to
tighten
his
hold
and
that
answer
asked
russ
revolution
said
mallory
simultaneous
revolution
in
the
jovian
confederacy
on
mars
and
venus
once
free
the
planets
will
stay
free
with
your
material
energy
engines
spencer
chambers
and
his
idea
of
solar
system
domination
will
be
too
late
greg
forehead
was
wrinkled
in
thought
his
facial
muscles
tensed
first
thing
to
do
he
said
is
to
contact
all
the
men
we
can
find
men
we
can
rely
on
to
help
us
carry
out
our
plans
we
need
more
televisor
machines
more
teleport
machines
some
for
use
on
mars
and
venus
others
for
the
jovian
moons
we
will
have
to
bring
the
men
here
to
learn
to
operate
them
it
take
a
few
days
we
get
some
men
to
work
on
new
machines
right
away
he
started
to
rise
from
his
chair
but
at
that
moment
the
coffee
and
sandwiches
arrived
greg
grinned
we
may
as
well
eat
first
mallory
looked
grateful
and
tried
to
keep
from
wolfing
the
food
the
others
pretended
not
to
notice
grim
hours
followed
an
unrelenting
search
over
two
planets
and
four
moons
for
men
whom
mallory
considered
loyal
to
his
cause
men
willing
to
risk
their
lives
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
interplanetary
they
were
hard
to
find
many
of
them
were
dead
victims
of
the
purge
the
others
were
in
hiding
and
word
of
them
was
difficult
to
get
but
slowly
one
by
one
they
were
ferreted
out
the
plan
explained
to
them
and
then
by
means
of
the
they
were
brought
to
the
hour
after
hour
men
worked
stripped
to
their
waists
in
the
glaring
inferno
of
terrible
force
fields
fashioning
new
television
units
as
fast
as
the
sets
were
constructed
they
were
placed
in
operation
the
work
went
faster
than
could
be
expected
yet
it
was
maddeningly
slow
for
with
the
passing
of
each
hour
stutsman
clamped
tighter
his
iron
grip
on
the
planets
concentration
camps
were
filled
to
overflowing
buildings
were
bombed
and
burned
murders
and
executions
were
becoming
too
common
to
be
news
then
suddenly
there
was
a
new
development
greg
craven
has
found
something
russ
cried
i
ca
get
him
supervising
the
installation
of
a
new
televisor
set
greg
spun
around
what
that
craven
i
ca
reach
him
he
blocking
me
out
greg
helped
but
the
apparatus
was
unable
to
enter
the
interplanetary
building
in
new
york
certain
other
portions
of
the
city
adjacent
to
the
building
also
were
blanketed
out
in
all
the
solar
system
the
interplanetary
building
was
the
only
place
they
could
not
enter
except
the
sun
itself
craven
had
developed
a
field
from
which
their
field
shied
off
the
televisor
seemed
to
roll
off
it
like
a
drop
of
mercury
that
definitely
ended
all
spying
on
craven
and
chambers
russ
mopped
his
brow
sucked
at
his
dead
pipe
light
penetrates
it
he
said
matter
penetrates
it
electricity
all
ordinary
forces
but
this
field
wo
it
well
whatever
craven
has
is
similarly
dissimilar
the
same
thing
of
opposite
nature
it
repels
our
field
but
does
affect
anything
else
that
means
he
has
analyzed
our
fields
we
have
wilson
to
thank
for
this
greg
nodded
gravely
there
just
one
thing
to
be
thankful
for
he
declared
he
probably
is
any
nearer
our
energy
than
he
was
before
but
now
we
ca
watch
him
and
that
field
of
his
shows
that
he
has
tremendous
power
of
some
sort
we
ca
watch
him
but
we
can
follow
him
corrected
russ
he
shake
us
none
of
them
can
the
mechanical
shadow
will
take
care
of
that
i
have
one
for
craven
with
a
bit
of
off
his
spectacles
and
he
keep
those
spectacles
never
fear
he
blind
as
a
bat
without
them
and
we
can
track
chambers
with
his
ring
that
right
agreed
greg
but
we
got
to
speed
up
craven
is
getting
under
way
now
if
he
does
this
he
can
do
something
else
something
that
will
really
hurt
us
the
man
clever
too
damn
clever
a
miracle
came
to
pass
in
ranthoor
when
a
man
for
whom
all
hope
had
been
abandoned
suddenly
appeared
within
the
city
streets
but
he
appeared
to
be
something
not
quite
earthly
for
he
did
not
have
the
solidity
of
a
man
he
was
pale
like
a
wraith
from
out
of
space
and
one
could
see
straight
through
him
yet
he
still
had
all
the
old
mannerisms
and
tricks
in
frightened
whispers
the
word
was
spread
the
spirit
of
john
moore
mallory
had
come
back
to
the
city
once
again
he
bulked
four
times
the
height
of
a
normal
man
and
there
was
that
singular
ghostliness
about
him
from
where
he
had
come
or
how
or
why
no
one
seemed
to
know
but
when
he
reached
the
steps
of
the
federation
administration
building
and
walked
straight
through
a
line
of
troopers
that
suddenly
massed
to
bar
his
way
and
when
he
turned
on
those
steps
and
spoke
to
the
people
who
had
gathered
there
was
none
to
doubt
that
at
last
a
sign
had
come
the
sign
that
now
if
ever
was
the
time
to
avenge
the
purge
now
the
time
to
take
vengeance
for
the
blood
that
flowed
in
gutters
for
the
throaty
chortling
of
the
flame
guns
that
had
snuffed
out
lives
against
a
broad
steel
wall
standing
on
the
steps
shadowy
but
plainly
visible
john
moore
mallory
talked
to
the
people
in
the
square
below
and
his
voice
was
the
voice
they
remembered
they
saw
him
toss
his
black
mane
of
hair
they
saw
his
clenched
fist
raised
in
terrible
anger
they
heard
the
boom
of
the
words
he
spoke
like
a
shrilling
alarm
the
words
spread
through
the
city
reverberating
from
the
dome
seeking
out
those
who
were
in
hiding
from
every
corner
of
the
city
from
its
deepest
cellars
and
its
darkest
alleys
poured
out
a
mass
of
humanity
that
surrounded
the
capitol
and
blackened
the
square
and
the
converging
streets
with
a
mob
that
shrieked
its
hatred
bellowed
its
anger
power
thundered
the
mighty
shadow
on
the
steps
power
to
burn
power
to
give
away
power
to
heat
the
dome
to
work
your
mines
to
drive
your
spaceships
power
answered
the
voice
of
the
crowd
power
it
sounded
like
a
battle
cry
no
more
accumulators
roared
the
towering
image
never
again
need
you
rely
on
spencer
chambers
for
your
power
callisto
is
yours
ranthoor
is
yours
the
black
crowd
surged
forward
reached
the
steps
and
started
to
climb
wild
cheers
in
their
throat
the
madness
of
victory
in
their
eyes
up
the
steps
came
men
with
nothing
but
bare
hands
screaming
women
jeering
children
officers
snapped
orders
at
the
troops
that
lined
the
steps
but
the
troopers
staring
into
the
awful
raging
maw
of
that
oncoming
crowd
dropped
their
guns
and
fled
back
into
the
capitol
building
with
the
mob
behind
them
shrilling
blood
lust
and
vengeance
out
of
the
red
and
yellow
wilderness
of
the
deserts
a
man
came
to
sandebar
on
mars
he
had
long
been
thought
dead
the
minions
of
the
government
had
announced
that
he
was
dead
but
he
had
been
in
hiding
for
six
years
his
beard
was
long
and
gray
his
eyes
were
curtained
by
hardship
his
white
hair
hung
about
his
shoulders
and
he
was
clothed
in
the
tattered
leather
trappings
of
the
spaceways
but
men
remembered
him
tom
brown
had
lead
the
last
revolt
against
the
martian
government
an
revolt
that
ended
almost
before
it
started
when
the
troopers
turned
loose
the
heavy
heaters
and
swept
the
streets
with
washing
waves
of
flame
when
he
climbed
to
the
base
of
a
statue
in
techor
park
to
address
the
crowd
that
gathered
the
police
shouted
for
him
to
come
down
and
he
disregarded
them
they
climbed
the
statue
to
reach
him
and
their
hands
went
through
him
tom
brown
stood
before
the
people
in
plain
view
and
spoke
but
he
was
there
other
things
happened
in
sandebar
that
day
a
voice
spoke
out
of
thin
air
a
voice
that
told
the
people
the
reign
of
interplanetary
was
over
it
told
of
a
mighty
new
source
of
power
power
that
would
cost
almost
nothing
power
that
would
make
the
accumulators
unnecessary
would
make
them
out
of
date
a
voice
that
said
the
people
need
no
longer
submit
to
the
yoke
of
spencer
chambers
government
in
order
to
obtain
the
power
they
needed
there
was
no
one
there
no
one
visible
at
all
and
yet
that
voice
went
on
and
on
a
great
crowd
gathered
listening
cheering
the
police
tried
to
break
it
up
and
failed
the
troops
were
ordered
out
and
the
people
fought
them
until
the
voice
told
them
to
disband
peaceably
and
go
to
their
homes
throughout
mars
it
was
the
same
in
a
dozen
places
in
sandebar
the
voice
spoke
it
spoke
in
a
dozen
places
out
of
empty
air
in
malacon
and
alexon
and
adebron
tom
brown
vanishing
into
the
air
after
his
speech
was
done
reappeared
a
few
minutes
later
in
adebron
and
there
the
police
warned
of
what
had
happened
in
sandebar
opened
fire
upon
him
when
he
stood
on
a
park
bench
to
address
the
people
but
the
flames
passed
through
and
did
not
touch
him
tom
brown
his
long
white
beard
covering
his
chest
his
mad
eyes
flashing
stood
in
the
fiery
blast
that
bellowed
from
the
muzzles
of
the
flame
rifles
and
calmly
talked
the
chief
of
police
at
new
chicago
venus
called
the
police
commissioner
there
a
guy
out
here
in
the
park
just
across
the
street
he
preaching
treason
he
telling
the
people
to
overthrow
the
government
in
the
ground
glass
the
police
commissioner
face
grew
purple
arrest
him
he
ordered
the
chief
clap
him
in
the
jug
do
you
have
to
call
me
up
every
time
one
of
those
boys
climbs
a
soap
box
run
him
in
i
ca
said
the
chief
the
police
commissioner
seemed
ready
to
explode
you
ca
why
the
hell
not
well
you
know
that
hill
in
the
center
of
the
park
memorial
hill
what
has
a
hill
got
to
do
with
it
the
commissioner
roared
he
sitting
on
top
of
that
hill
he
a
thousand
feet
tall
his
head
is
way
up
in
the
sky
and
his
voice
is
like
thunder
how
can
you
arrest
anybody
like
that
everywhere
in
the
system
revolt
was
flaming
new
marching
songs
rolled
out
between
the
worlds
wild
marching
songs
that
had
the
note
of
anger
in
them
weapons
were
brought
out
of
hiding
and
polished
new
standards
were
raised
in
an
tide
against
oppression
freedom
was
on
the
march
again
the
right
of
a
man
to
rule
himself
the
way
he
chose
to
rule
a
new
declaration
of
independence
a
solar
magna
carta
there
were
new
leaders
led
by
the
old
leaders
led
by
spirits
that
marched
across
the
sky
led
by
voices
that
spoke
out
of
the
air
led
by
signs
and
symbols
and
a
courage
and
a
great
and
a
deep
conviction
that
right
in
the
end
would
triumph
spencer
chambers
glared
at
ludwig
stutsman
this
is
one
time
you
went
too
far
if
you
given
me
a
free
hand
before
this
would
have
been
necessary
stutsman
said
but
you
were
soft
you
made
me
go
easy
when
i
should
have
ground
them
down
you
left
the
way
open
for
all
sorts
of
plots
and
schemes
and
leaders
to
develop
the
two
men
faced
one
another
one
the
smooth
tawny
lion
the
other
the
snarling
wolf
you
built
up
hatred
stutsman
chambers
said
you
are
the
most
hated
man
in
the
solar
system
and
because
of
you
they
hate
me
that
was
my
idea
i
needed
you
because
i
needed
an
iron
fist
but
i
needed
it
to
use
judiciously
and
you
have
been
ruthless
you
used
force
when
conciliation
was
necessary
stutsman
sneered
openly
still
that
old
dream
of
a
benevolent
dictatorship
still
figuring
yourself
a
little
bronze
god
to
be
set
up
in
every
household
a
dictatorship
ca
be
run
that
way
you
have
to
let
them
know
you
boss
chambers
was
calm
again
argument
wo
do
us
any
good
now
the
damage
is
done
revolt
is
flaming
through
all
the
worlds
we
have
to
do
something
he
looked
at
craven
who
was
slouched
in
a
chair
beside
the
desk
across
which
he
and
stutsman
faced
each
other
can
you
help
us
doctor
he
asked
craven
shrugged
perhaps
he
said
acidly
if
i
could
only
be
left
to
my
work
undisturbed
instead
of
being
dragged
into
these
stupid
conferences
i
might
be
able
to
do
something
you
already
have
have
you
asked
chambers
very
little
i
been
able
to
blank
out
the
televisor
that
manning
and
page
are
using
but
that
is
all
do
you
have
any
idea
where
manning
and
page
are
how
could
i
know
craven
asked
somewhere
in
space
they
at
the
bottom
of
this
snarled
stutsman
their
damned
tricks
and
propaganda
we
know
they
at
the
bottom
of
it
said
craven
that
no
news
to
us
if
it
were
for
them
we
would
have
this
trouble
now
despite
your
bungling
but
that
does
help
us
any
with
this
new
discovery
of
mine
i
have
shielded
this
building
from
their
observation
they
spy
on
us
any
more
but
that
as
far
as
i
got
they
televised
the
secret
meeting
of
the
emergency
council
when
it
met
in
satellite
city
on
ganymede
the
other
day
said
chambers
the
whole
jovian
confederacy
watched
and
listened
to
that
meeting
heard
our
secret
war
plans
for
fully
ten
minutes
before
the
trick
was
discovered
could
we
use
your
shield
to
prevent
such
a
situation
again
better
still
suggested
stutsman
let
shield
the
whole
satellite
without
manning
ghostly
leaders
this
revolt
would
collapse
of
its
own
weight
craven
shook
his
head
it
takes
fifty
tons
of
accumulators
to
build
up
that
field
and
a
ton
of
fuel
a
day
to
maintain
it
just
for
this
building
alone
it
would
be
impossible
to
shield
a
whole
planet
an
entire
moon
any
progress
on
your
collector
field
asked
chambers
some
craven
admitted
i
know
in
a
day
or
two
that
would
give
us
something
with
which
to
fight
manning
and
page
would
it
yes
agreed
craven
it
would
be
something
to
fight
them
with
if
i
can
develop
that
collector
field
we
would
be
able
to
utilize
every
radiation
in
space
from
the
heat
wave
down
through
the
cosmics
within
the
solar
system
our
power
would
be
absolutely
limitless
your
accumulators
depend
for
their
power
storage
upon
just
one
radiation
heat
but
with
this
idea
i
have
you
use
all
types
of
radiations
you
say
you
could
even
put
the
cosmics
to
work
asked
chambers
craven
nodded
if
i
can
do
anything
at
all
with
the
field
i
can
how
demanded
stutsman
by
breaking
them
up
you
fool
smash
the
short
waves
into
a
lot
of
longer
waves
craven
swung
back
to
face
chambers
but
do
count
on
it
he
warned
i
have
done
it
yet
you
have
to
do
it
chambers
insisted
craven
rose
from
his
chair
his
blue
eyes
blazing
angrily
behind
the
heavy
lenses
how
often
must
i
tell
you
that
you
can
not
hurry
scientific
investigation
you
have
to
try
and
try
follow
one
tiny
clue
to
another
tiny
clue
you
have
to
be
patient
you
have
to
hope
but
you
can
not
force
the
work
he
strode
from
the
room
slammed
the
door
behind
him
chambers
turned
slowly
in
his
chair
to
face
stutsman
his
gray
eyes
bored
into
the
wolfish
face
and
now
he
suggested
suppose
you
tell
me
just
why
you
did
it
stutsman
lips
curled
i
suppose
you
would
rather
i
had
allowed
those
troublemakers
to
go
ahead
consolidate
their
plans
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
root
them
out
liquidate
them
i
did
it
you
chose
a
poor
time
said
chambers
softly
you
would
have
to
do
something
like
this
just
at
the
time
when
manning
is
lurking
around
the
solar
system
somewhere
carrying
enough
power
to
wipe
us
off
the
face
of
the
earth
if
he
wanted
to
that
why
i
did
it
protested
stutsman
i
knew
manning
was
around
i
was
afraid
he
start
something
so
i
beat
him
to
it
i
thought
it
would
throw
a
scare
into
the
people
make
them
afraid
to
follow
manning
when
he
acted
you
have
a
low
opinion
of
the
human
race
do
you
chambers
said
you
think
you
can
beat
them
into
a
mire
of
helplessness
and
fear
chambers
rose
from
his
chair
pounded
his
desk
for
emphasis
but
you
ca
do
it
stutsman
men
have
tried
it
before
you
from
the
very
dawn
of
history
you
can
destroy
their
homes
and
kill
their
children
you
can
burn
them
at
the
stake
or
in
the
electric
chair
hang
them
or
them
or
herd
them
into
gas
chambers
you
can
drive
them
like
cattle
into
concentration
camps
you
can
keep
the
torture
racks
bloody
but
you
ca
break
them
because
the
people
always
survive
their
courage
is
greater
than
the
courage
of
any
one
man
or
group
of
men
they
always
reach
the
man
who
has
oppressed
them
they
always
tear
him
down
from
the
place
he
sits
and
they
do
not
deal
gently
with
him
when
they
do
in
the
end
the
people
always
win
chambers
reached
across
the
desk
and
caught
stutsman
by
the
slack
of
the
shirt
a
twist
of
his
hand
tightened
the
fabric
around
stutsman
neck
the
financier
thrust
his
face
close
to
the
wolfish
scowl
that
is
what
is
going
to
happen
to
you
and
me
we
go
down
in
history
as
just
a
couple
of
damn
fools
who
tried
to
rule
and
could
make
the
grade
thanks
to
you
and
your
damned
stupidity
you
and
your
blood
purges
patches
of
anger
burned
on
stutsman
cheeks
his
eyes
glittered
and
his
lips
were
white
but
his
whisper
was
bitter
mockery
maybe
we
should
have
coddled
and
humored
them
made
them
just
so
awful
happy
that
big
bad
old
interplanetary
had
them
so
they
could
have
set
up
little
bronze
images
of
you
in
their
homes
so
you
could
have
been
sort
of
a
solar
god
i
still
think
it
would
have
been
the
better
way
chambers
flung
stutsman
from
him
with
a
push
the
man
reeled
and
staggered
across
the
carpeted
floor
get
out
of
my
sight
stutsman
straightened
his
shirt
turned
and
left
chambers
slumped
into
his
chair
his
hands
grasping
the
arms
on
either
side
of
his
great
body
his
eyes
staring
out
through
the
window
from
which
flooded
the
last
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
drums
pounded
in
his
brain
the
drums
of
rebellion
out
in
space
of
rebellion
on
those
other
worlds
drums
that
were
drowning
out
and
shattering
forever
the
dream
that
he
had
woven
he
had
wanted
economic
dictatorship
not
the
cold
passionless
terrible
dictatorship
that
stutsman
typified
but
one
that
would
bring
peace
and
prosperity
and
happiness
to
the
solar
system
he
closed
his
eyes
and
thought
snatches
of
ambition
snatches
of
hopes
but
it
was
useless
to
think
for
the
drums
and
the
imagined
shouting
drowned
out
his
thoughts
mankind
did
give
a
damn
for
good
business
administration
nor
a
hoot
for
prosperity
or
peace
or
happiness
liberty
and
the
right
to
rule
the
right
to
go
risk
one
neck
to
climb
a
mountain
or
cross
a
desert
or
explore
a
swamp
the
right
to
aim
one
sights
at
distant
stars
to
fling
a
taunting
challenge
into
the
teeth
of
space
to
probe
with
clumsy
fingers
and
force
nature
to
lay
bare
her
secrets
that
was
what
mankind
wanted
that
was
what
those
men
out
on
mars
and
venus
and
in
the
jovian
worlds
were
fighting
for
not
against
spencer
chambers
or
ludwig
stutsman
or
interplanetary
power
but
for
the
thing
that
drove
man
on
and
made
of
him
a
flame
that
others
might
follow
fighting
for
a
heritage
that
was
first
expressed
when
the
first
man
growled
at
the
entrance
to
his
cave
and
dared
the
world
to
take
it
from
him
spencer
chambers
closed
his
eyes
and
rocked
back
and
forth
in
the
tilting
office
chair
it
had
been
a
good
fight
a
hard
fight
he
had
had
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
it
but
he
was
licked
after
all
these
years
he
had
held
the
biggest
dream
of
any
man
who
ever
lived
alexander
and
napoleon
hitler
stalin
and
those
other
fellows
had
been
pikers
alongside
of
spencer
chambers
they
had
only
aimed
at
earthly
conquest
while
he
had
reached
out
to
grab
at
all
the
worlds
but
by
heaven
he
almost
made
it
a
door
grated
open
chambers
said
a
voice
his
feet
hit
the
floor
with
a
thud
and
he
sat
stiff
and
staring
at
the
figure
in
the
door
it
was
craven
and
the
man
was
excited
his
glasses
were
slid
far
down
on
his
nose
his
hair
was
standing
on
end
his
tie
was
all
awry
i
have
it
craven
whooped
i
have
it
at
last
hope
clutched
at
chambers
but
he
was
almost
afraid
to
speak
have
what
he
whispered
tensely
the
collector
field
it
was
under
my
nose
all
the
time
but
i
see
it
chambers
was
out
of
his
chair
and
striding
across
the
room
a
tumult
buzzed
within
his
skull
licked
hell
he
had
even
started
he
win
yet
he
teach
the
people
to
revolt
he
run
manning
and
page
out
to
the
end
of
space
and
push
them
through
it
was
a
weird
revolution
there
were
few
battles
little
blood
shed
there
seemed
to
be
no
secret
plots
there
were
no
skulking
leaders
no
passwords
nothing
that
in
former
years
had
marked
rebellion
against
tyranny
it
was
a
revolution
carried
out
with
utter
boldness
secret
police
were
helpless
for
it
was
not
a
secret
revolution
the
regular
police
and
the
troopers
were
helpless
because
the
men
they
wanted
to
arrest
were
shadows
that
flitter
here
and
there
large
and
substantial
shadows
but
impossible
to
seize
and
imprison
every
scheme
that
was
hatched
within
the
government
circles
was
known
almost
at
once
to
the
ghostly
leaders
who
stalked
the
land
police
detachments
armed
with
warrants
for
the
arrests
of
men
who
had
participated
in
some
action
which
would
stamp
them
as
active
rebels
found
the
suspects
absent
when
they
broke
down
the
doors
someone
had
warned
them
troops
hurried
to
points
where
riots
had
broken
out
arrived
to
find
peaceful
scenes
but
with
evidence
of
recent
battle
the
rioters
had
been
warned
had
made
their
getaway
when
the
rebels
struck
it
was
always
at
the
most
opportune
time
when
the
government
was
off
balance
or
off
guard
in
the
first
day
of
the
revolt
ranthoor
fell
when
the
maddened
populace
urged
on
by
the
words
of
a
shadowy
john
moore
mallory
charged
the
federation
buildings
the
government
fled
leaving
all
records
behind
to
satellite
city
on
ganymede
in
the
first
week
three
martian
cities
fell
but
sandebar
the
capital
still
held
out
on
venus
radium
city
was
taken
by
the
rebels
within
hours
after
the
first
call
to
revolt
had
rung
across
the
worlds
but
new
chicago
the
seat
of
government
still
was
in
the
government
hands
facing
a
siege
government
propagandists
spread
the
word
that
the
material
energy
engines
were
not
safe
reports
were
broadcast
that
on
at
least
two
occasions
the
engines
had
blown
up
killing
the
men
who
operated
them
but
this
propaganda
failed
to
gain
credence
for
in
the
cities
that
were
in
the
rebel
hands
technicians
were
at
work
manufacturing
and
setting
up
the
material
engines
demonstrations
were
given
the
people
saw
them
saw
what
enormous
power
they
developed
russ
page
stared
incredulously
at
the
television
screen
it
seemed
to
be
shifting
back
and
forth
one
second
it
held
the
distorted
view
of
satellite
city
on
ganymede
and
the
next
second
the
view
of
jumbled
icy
desert
somewhere
outside
the
city
look
here
greg
he
said
something
wrong
greg
manning
turned
away
from
the
calculator
where
he
had
been
working
and
stared
at
the
screen
how
long
has
it
been
acting
that
way
he
asked
just
started
said
russ
greg
straightened
and
glanced
down
the
row
of
television
machines
some
of
them
were
dead
their
switches
closed
but
on
the
screens
of
many
of
the
others
was
the
same
effect
as
on
this
machine
their
operators
were
working
frustratedly
at
the
controls
trying
to
focus
the
image
bring
it
into
sharp
relief
ca
seem
to
get
a
thing
sir
said
one
of
the
men
i
was
working
on
the
fueling
station
out
on
io
and
the
screen
just
went
haywire
mine
seems
to
be
all
right
said
another
man
i
had
it
on
sandebar
for
the
last
couple
of
hours
and
there
nothing
wrong
a
swift
check
revealed
one
fact
the
machines
when
trained
on
the
jovian
worlds
refused
to
function
anywhere
else
in
space
however
they
worked
perfectly
russ
stoked
and
lit
his
pipe
snapped
off
his
machine
and
swung
around
in
the
operator
chair
somebody
playing
hell
with
us
out
around
jupiter
he
stated
calmly
i
been
expecting
something
like
this
said
greg
i
have
been
afraid
of
this
ever
since
craven
blanketed
us
out
of
the
interplanetary
building
he
really
must
have
something
this
time
russ
agreed
he
blanketing
out
the
entire
jovian
system
there
a
space
field
of
low
intensity
surrounding
all
of
jupiter
enclosing
all
the
moons
he
keeps
shifting
the
intensity
so
that
even
though
we
can
force
our
way
through
his
field
the
irregular
variations
make
it
impossible
to
line
up
anything
it
works
in
principle
just
as
effectively
as
if
we
could
get
through
at
all
greg
whistled
soundlessly
through
suddenly
bared
teeth
that
takes
power
he
said
and
i
afraid
craven
has
it
power
to
burn
the
collector
field
asked
russ
greg
nodded
a
field
that
sucks
in
radiant
energy
free
energy
that
he
just
reaches
out
and
grabs
and
it
does
depend
on
the
sun
alone
it
probably
makes
use
of
every
type
of
radiation
in
all
of
space
russ
slumped
in
his
chair
smoking
his
forehead
wrinkled
in
thought
if
that
what
he
got
he
finally
declared
he
going
to
be
hard
to
crack
he
can
suck
in
any
radiant
vibration
form
any
space
vibration
he
can
shift
them
around
break
them
down
and
build
them
up
he
can
discharge
them
direct
them
he
got
a
vibration
plant
the
handiest
little
war
machine
that
ever
existed
greg
suddenly
wheeled
and
walked
to
a
wall
cabinet
from
it
he
took
a
box
and
opening
it
lifted
out
a
tiny
mechanism
he
chuckled
deep
in
his
throat
the
mechanical
shadow
the
little
machine
that
always
tells
us
where
craven
is
as
long
as
he
wearing
his
glasses
he
always
wears
them
said
russ
crisply
he
blind
as
a
bat
without
them
greg
set
the
machine
down
on
the
table
when
we
find
craven
we
find
the
contraption
that
blanketing
jupiter
and
its
moons
dials
spun
and
needles
quivered
rapidly
russ
jotted
down
the
readings
on
a
sheet
of
paper
at
the
calculator
he
tapped
keys
depressed
the
activator
the
machine
hummed
and
snarled
and
chuckled
russ
glanced
at
the
result
imprinted
on
the
paper
roll
craven
is
out
near
jupiter
he
announced
about
miles
distant
from
its
surface
in
a
plane
normal
to
the
sun
rays
a
spaceship
suggested
greg
russ
nodded
that
the
only
answer
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
that
something
we
can
get
hold
of
said
greg
he
walked
to
the
ship
controls
and
lowered
himself
into
the
chair
a
hand
came
out
and
hauled
back
a
lever
the
moved
from
the
engine
rooms
came
the
whine
of
the
gigantic
power
plant
as
it
built
up
and
maintained
the
gravity
concentration
center
suddenly
created
in
front
of
the
ship
russ
standing
beside
greg
at
the
control
panel
looked
out
into
space
and
marveled
they
were
flashing
through
space
their
speed
building
up
at
a
rate
yet
they
had
no
real
propulsion
power
the
discovery
of
the
gravity
concentrator
had
outdated
such
a
method
of
driving
a
spaceship
instead
they
were
falling
hurtling
downward
into
the
yawning
maw
of
an
artificial
gravity
field
and
such
a
method
made
for
speed
terrible
speed
jupiter
seemed
to
leap
at
them
it
became
a
great
crimson
and
yellow
ball
that
filled
almost
half
the
vision
plate
the
speed
was
slacking
off
slower
and
slower
until
it
barely
crawled
in
comparison
to
its
former
speed
slowly
they
circled
jupiter
great
girth
staring
out
of
the
vision
port
for
a
sight
of
craven
ship
they
were
nearing
the
position
the
little
mechanical
shadow
had
indicated
there
it
is
said
russ
suddenly
almost
breathlessly
far
out
in
space
tiny
almost
like
a
dust
mote
against
the
great
bulk
of
the
monster
planet
rode
a
tiny
light
slowly
the
crawled
inward
the
mote
of
light
became
a
gleaming
silver
ship
a
mighty
ship
one
that
was
fully
as
large
as
the
that
it
all
right
said
greg
they
lying
behind
a
log
out
here
raising
hell
with
our
television
apparatus
maybe
we
better
tickle
them
a
little
bit
and
see
what
they
have
rising
from
the
control
board
he
went
to
another
control
panel
russ
remained
standing
in
front
of
the
vision
plate
staring
down
at
the
ship
out
in
space
behind
him
came
a
shrill
howl
from
the
power
plant
the
staggered
slightly
a
beam
of
deep
indigo
lashed
across
space
a
finger
suddenly
jabbing
at
the
other
ship
space
was
suddenly
colored
for
thousands
of
miles
as
the
beam
struck
craven
ship
and
seemed
to
explode
in
a
blast
of
dazzling
indigo
light
the
ship
reeled
under
the
impact
of
the
blow
reeled
and
weaved
in
space
as
the
beam
struck
it
and
delivered
to
it
the
mighty
power
of
the
screaming
engines
back
in
the
engine
room
what
happened
greg
screamed
above
the
roar
russ
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
jarred
him
a
little
pushed
him
through
space
for
several
hundred
miles
made
him
know
something
had
hit
him
but
it
did
seem
to
do
any
damage
that
was
pure
cosmic
i
gave
him
five
billion
horsepower
and
it
just
staggered
him
he
got
a
space
lens
that
absorbs
the
energy
said
russ
the
lens
concentrates
it
and
pours
it
into
a
receiving
chamber
probably
a
huge
nobody
yet
has
burned
out
one
of
those
things
on
a
closed
circuit
greg
wrinkled
his
brow
perplexed
what
he
must
have
is
a
special
field
of
some
sort
that
lowers
the
and
the
intensity
he
getting
natural
cosmics
all
the
time
and
taking
care
of
them
that
would
be
much
of
a
trick
russ
pointed
out
but
when
he
takes
care
of
cosmics
backed
by
five
billion
horsepower
that
something
else
greg
grinned
wickedly
i
going
to
hand
him
a
long
heat
radiation
if
his
field
shortens
that
any
he
have
radio
beam
and
that
will
blow
all
to
hell
he
stabbed
viciously
at
the
keys
on
the
board
and
once
again
the
shrill
howl
of
the
engines
came
from
the
rear
of
the
ship
a
lance
of
red
splashed
out
across
space
and
touched
the
other
ship
again
space
was
lit
this
time
with
a
crimson
glow
russ
shook
his
head
nothing
doing
greg
sat
down
and
looked
at
russ
funny
thing
about
this
they
just
sat
there
and
let
us
throw
two
charges
at
them
took
everything
we
gave
them
and
never
tried
to
hand
it
back
maybe
they
have
anything
to
hand
us
russ
suggested
hopefully
they
must
have
craven
would
take
to
space
with
just
a
purely
defensive
weapon
he
knew
we
find
him
and
he
have
a
fight
on
his
hands
russ
found
his
pipe
was
dead
snapping
his
lighter
he
applied
flame
to
the
blackened
tobacco
walking
slowly
to
the
wall
cabinet
he
lifted
two
other
boxes
out
set
them
on
the
table
and
took
from
them
two
other
mechanical
shadows
he
turned
them
on
and
leaned
close
watching
the
spinning
dials
the
quivering
needles
greg
he
whispered
chambers
and
stutsman
are
there
in
that
ship
with
craven
look
their
shadows
register
identical
with
the
one
that
spotted
craven
i
suspected
as
much
greg
replied
we
got
the
whole
pack
cornered
out
here
if
we
can
just
get
rid
of
them
the
whole
war
would
be
won
in
one
stroke
russ
lifted
a
stricken
face
from
the
row
of
tiny
mechanisms
this
is
our
big
chance
we
may
never
get
it
again
the
next
hour
could
decide
who
is
going
to
win
greg
rose
from
the
chair
and
stood
before
the
control
board
grimly
he
punched
a
series
of
keys
the
engines
howled
again
greg
twisted
a
dial
and
the
howl
rose
into
a
shrill
scream
from
the
another
beam
lashed
out
another
and
another
space
was
speared
with
beam
after
beam
hurtling
from
the
great
ship
swiftly
the
beams
went
through
the
range
of
radiation
through
radio
and
short
radio
visible
light
the
gammas
and
the
cosmics
a
terrific
flood
of
billions
of
horsepower
craven
ship
buckled
and
careened
under
the
lashing
impacts
of
the
bombardment
but
it
seemed
unhurt
greg
face
was
bleaker
than
usual
as
he
turned
from
the
board
to
look
at
russ
we
used
everything
we
have
he
said
and
he
stopped
them
all
we
ca
touch
him
russ
shivered
the
control
room
suddenly
seemed
chilly
with
a
frightening
kind
of
cold
he
carrying
and
several
thousand
tons
of
accumulator
stacks
not
much
power
left
in
them
he
could
pour
a
billion
horsepower
into
them
for
hours
and
still
have
room
for
more
greg
nodded
wearily
all
we
been
doing
is
feeding
him
the
engines
were
humming
quietly
now
singing
the
low
song
of
power
held
in
leash
but
then
they
screamed
like
a
buzz
saw
biting
into
an
stick
of
white
oak
screamed
in
a
single
frightful
agony
as
they
threw
into
the
protecting
wall
that
enclosed
the
all
the
power
they
could
develop
the
air
of
the
ship
was
instantaneously
charged
with
a
hazy
bluish
glow
and
the
sharp
stinging
odor
of
ozone
filled
the
ship
outside
an
enormous
burst
of
flame
splashed
and
spattered
around
the
living
lightning
played
in
solid
snapping
sheets
around
the
vision
port
and
ran
in
trickling
blazing
fire
across
the
plates
russ
cried
out
and
backed
away
holding
his
arm
before
his
eyes
it
was
as
if
he
had
looked
into
a
nova
of
energy
exploding
before
his
eyes
in
the
instant
the
scream
died
and
the
splash
of
terrific
fire
had
vanished
only
a
rapidly
dying
glow
remained
what
was
it
asked
russ
dazedly
what
happened
ten
engines
every
one
of
them
capable
of
over
five
billion
horsepower
and
every
one
of
them
screaming
craven
said
greg
grimly
he
let
us
have
everything
he
had
he
simply
drained
his
accumulator
stacks
and
threw
it
all
into
our
face
but
done
now
that
was
his
only
shot
he
have
to
build
up
power
now
and
that
will
take
a
while
but
we
could
have
taken
much
more
stalemate
said
russ
we
ca
hurt
him
he
ca
hurt
us
not
by
a
damn
sight
declared
greg
i
still
have
a
trick
or
two
in
mind
he
tried
them
from
the
a
bolt
of
living
light
and
fire
sprang
out
as
all
ten
engines
thundered
with
an
insane
voice
that
racked
the
ship
fireworks
exploded
in
space
when
the
bolt
struck
craven
ship
screen
after
screen
exploded
in
glittering
flaming
sparks
but
the
ship
rode
the
lashing
charge
finally
halted
the
thrust
of
power
the
beam
glowed
faintly
died
out
perspiration
streamed
down
greg
face
as
he
bent
over
a
calculator
and
constructed
the
formula
for
a
magnetic
field
he
sent
out
a
field
of
such
unimaginable
intensity
that
it
would
have
drawn
any
within
a
mile
of
it
into
a
hard
compact
mass
even
the
a
hundred
miles
away
lurched
under
the
strain
but
craven
ship
after
the
first
wild
jerk
did
not
move
a
curious
soft
glow
spread
out
from
the
ship
veered
sharply
and
disappeared
in
the
magnetic
field
greg
swore
softly
he
cutting
it
down
as
fast
as
i
try
to
build
it
up
he
explained
and
i
ca
move
it
any
nearer
from
craven
ship
lashed
out
another
thunderbolt
and
once
again
the
engines
screamed
in
terrible
unison
as
they
poured
power
into
the
triple
screen
the
first
screen
stopped
all
material
things
the
second
stopped
radiations
by
refracting
them
into
the
fourth
dimension
the
third
shield
was
akin
to
the
field
which
stopped
all
matter
and
yet
the
ten
engines
bellowed
like
things
insane
as
craven
struck
with
flaming
bolts
utilizing
the
power
he
had
absorbed
from
the
fifty
billion
horsepower
greg
had
thrown
at
him
there
was
anger
in
greg
manning
face
a
terrible
anger
his
fists
knotted
and
he
shook
them
at
the
gleaming
ship
that
lay
far
down
near
jupiter
i
got
one
trick
left
he
shouted
almost
as
if
he
expected
craven
to
hear
just
one
trick
damn
you
see
if
you
can
stop
this
one
he
set
up
the
pattern
on
the
board
and
punched
the
activating
lever
the
ten
engines
thrummed
with
power
then
the
howling
died
away
four
times
they
screamed
and
four
times
they
ebbed
into
a
gentle
hum
get
on
the
navigation
controls
yelled
greg
be
ready
to
give
the
ship
all
you
got
greg
leaped
for
the
control
chair
grasped
the
acceleration
lever
now
growled
greg
look
out
craven
we
coming
at
you
greg
teeth
gritted
slammed
the
acceleration
over
suddenly
all
space
wrenched
horribly
with
a
nauseating
terrible
thud
that
seemed
to
strain
at
the
very
anchors
of
the
universe
jupiter
and
the
jovian
worlds
leaped
suddenly
backward
turned
swiftly
green
then
blue
and
faded
in
an
instant
into
violet
the
sun
spun
crazily
through
space
retreating
dimming
to
a
tiny
star
the
giant
generators
in
the
hummed
louder
now
continually
louder
a
roar
that
trembled
through
every
plate
through
every
girder
through
every
bit
of
metal
in
the
ship
the
ship
itself
was
plunging
spaceward
streaking
like
a
runaway
star
for
the
depths
of
space
beyond
the
solar
system
and
behind
it
caught
tight
gripped
and
held
craven
ship
trailed
at
the
end
of
a
tractor
field
that
bound
it
to
the
the
acceleration
compensator
functioning
perfectly
had
taken
up
the
slack
as
the
ship
had
plunged
from
a
standing
start
into
a
speed
that
neared
the
pace
of
light
but
it
had
never
been
built
to
stand
such
sudden
intense
acceleration
and
for
an
instant
russ
and
greg
seemed
to
be
crushed
by
a
mighty
weight
that
struck
at
them
the
sensation
swiftly
lifted
as
the
compensator
took
up
the
load
greg
shook
his
head
flinging
the
trickling
perspiration
from
his
eyes
i
hope
their
compensator
worked
as
well
as
ours
he
said
if
it
did
declared
russ
we
towing
a
shipload
of
dead
men
russ
glanced
at
the
speed
dial
they
were
almost
touching
the
speed
of
light
he
has
cut
down
our
speed
yet
we
threw
him
off
his
balance
his
drive
depends
largely
on
the
mass
of
some
planet
as
a
body
to
take
up
the
reaction
of
his
ship
jupiter
is
the
ideal
body
for
that
but
he
leaving
jupiter
behind
he
has
to
do
something
soon
or
it
be
too
late
he
getting
less
energy
too
said
russ
we
retreating
from
his
main
sources
of
energy
the
sun
and
jupiter
almost
the
speed
of
light
and
that
would
cut
down
his
energy
intake
terrifically
he
has
to
use
what
he
got
in
his
accumulators
and
after
that
last
blast
at
us
they
must
be
nearly
drained
as
russ
watched
the
speed
needle
fell
off
slightly
russ
held
his
breath
it
edged
back
slowly
creeping
the
speed
was
being
cut
down
craven
is
using
whatever
power
he
has
he
said
they
alive
back
there
all
right
he
trying
to
catch
hold
of
jupiter
and
make
its
gravity
work
for
him
the
felt
the
strain
of
the
other
ship
now
felt
it
as
craven
poured
power
into
his
drive
fighting
to
get
free
of
the
invisible
hawser
that
had
trapped
him
fighting
against
being
dragged
into
outer
space
at
the
of
a
mighty
craft
heading
spaceward
with
frightening
speed
girders
groaned
in
the
the
engines
moaned
and
throbbed
the
speed
needle
fell
back
creeping
down
the
dial
slowly
unwillingly
resisting
any
drop
in
speed
but
craven
was
cutting
it
down
and
as
he
cut
it
he
was
able
to
absorb
more
energy
with
his
collector
lens
but
he
was
fighting
two
things
momentum
and
the
steadily
decreasing
gravitational
pull
of
jupiter
and
the
sun
the
sun
pull
was
dwindling
slowly
jupiter
rapidly
the
needle
still
crept
downward
what
his
point
of
equality
to
us
demanded
greg
will
we
make
it
russ
shook
his
head
wo
know
for
hours
he
be
able
to
slow
us
up
maybe
he
even
stop
us
or
be
able
to
jerk
free
although
i
doubt
that
but
every
minute
takes
him
farther
away
from
his
main
source
of
power
the
solar
system
radiation
he
could
collect
power
anywhere
in
space
you
know
but
the
best
place
to
collect
it
is
near
large
radiant
bodies
russ
continued
to
crouch
over
the
dial
begrudging
every
backward
flicker
of
the
needle
this
was
the
last
play
the
final
hand
if
they
could
drag
craven
and
his
ship
away
from
the
solar
system
maroon
him
deep
in
space
far
removed
from
any
source
of
radiation
they
would
win
for
they
could
go
back
and
finish
the
work
of
smashing
interplanetary
but
if
craven
won
if
he
could
halt
their
mad
dash
for
space
if
he
could
shake
free
they
never
have
another
chance
he
would
be
studying
that
field
they
had
wrapped
around
him
be
ready
for
it
next
time
might
even
develop
one
like
it
and
use
it
on
the
if
craven
could
win
his
way
back
to
the
sun
he
would
be
stronger
than
they
were
could
top
them
in
power
shatter
all
their
plans
and
once
again
the
worlds
would
bow
to
interplanetary
and
spencer
chambers
russ
watched
the
meter
the
speed
was
little
more
than
ten
miles
a
second
now
and
dropping
rapidly
he
sat
motionless
hunched
sucking
at
his
dead
pipe
listening
to
the
thrumming
of
the
generators
if
we
only
had
a
margin
he
groaned
if
we
just
had
a
few
more
horsepower
just
a
few
but
we
wide
open
every
engine
is
developing
everything
it
can
greg
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
gently
russ
turned
his
head
and
looked
into
the
face
of
his
friend
a
face
as
bleak
as
ever
but
with
a
hint
of
smile
in
the
corners
of
the
eyes
why
not
let
jupiter
help
us
he
asked
he
could
be
a
lot
of
help
russ
stared
for
a
moment
uncomprehending
then
with
a
sob
of
gladness
he
reached
out
a
hand
shoved
over
a
lever
mirrors
of
shifted
assumed
different
angles
and
the
sheered
off
they
were
no
longer
retreating
directly
from
the
sun
but
at
an
angle
quartering
off
across
the
solar
system
greg
grinned
we
falling
behind
jupiter
now
letting
jupiter
run
away
from
us
as
he
circles
his
orbit
following
the
sun
adds
miles
per
second
to
our
velocity
of
retreat
even
if
it
does
show
on
the
dial
the
cosmic
tug
of
war
went
on
grimly
two
ships
straining
fighting
each
other
one
seeking
to
escape
the
other
straining
to
snake
the
second
ship
into
the
maw
of
open
hostile
space
the
speed
was
down
to
five
miles
a
second
then
a
fraction
lower
the
needle
was
flickering
now
impossible
to
decide
whether
it
was
dropping
or
not
and
in
the
engine
rooms
ten
great
generators
howled
in
their
attempt
to
make
that
needle
move
up
the
dial
again
russ
lit
his
pipe
his
eyes
not
leaving
the
dial
the
needle
was
creeping
lower
again
down
to
three
miles
a
second
now
he
puffed
clouds
of
smoke
and
considered
saturn
fortunately
was
ninety
degrees
around
in
his
orbit
on
the
present
course
only
neptune
remained
between
them
and
free
space
pluto
was
far
away
but
even
if
it
had
been
it
really
would
count
for
it
was
small
and
had
little
attraction
in
a
short
while
ganymede
and
callisto
would
be
moving
around
on
the
far
side
of
jupiter
and
that
might
help
everything
counted
so
much
now
the
dial
was
down
to
two
miles
a
second
and
there
it
hung
hung
and
stayed
russ
watched
it
with
narrowed
eyes
by
this
time
craven
certainly
would
have
given
up
much
hope
of
help
from
jupiter
if
the
big
planet
could
have
helped
him
before
it
certainly
could
now
in
another
hour
or
two
earth
would
transit
the
sun
and
that
would
cut
down
the
radiant
energy
to
some
degree
but
in
the
meantime
craven
was
loading
his
and
accumulators
was
laying
up
a
power
reserve
as
a
last
desperate
resort
he
would
use
that
power
in
a
final
attempt
to
break
away
from
the
russ
waited
for
that
attempt
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
about
it
the
engines
were
developing
every
watt
of
power
that
could
be
urged
out
of
them
if
craven
had
the
power
to
break
away
he
would
break
away
that
was
all
there
would
be
to
it
an
hour
passed
and
the
needle
crept
up
a
fraction
of
a
point
russ
was
still
watching
the
dial
his
mind
foggy
with
concentration
suddenly
the
shuddered
and
seemed
to
totter
in
space
as
if
something
some
mighty
force
had
struck
the
ship
a
terrific
blow
the
needle
swung
swiftly
backward
reached
one
mile
a
second
dipped
to
half
a
mile
russ
sat
bolt
upright
holding
his
breath
his
teeth
clenched
with
death
grip
upon
the
craven
had
blasted
with
everything
he
had
he
had
used
every
last
trickle
of
power
in
the
accumulators
all
the
power
he
had
been
storing
up
russ
leaped
from
the
chair
and
raced
to
the
periscopic
mirror
stooping
he
stared
into
it
far
back
in
space
like
a
silver
bauble
swung
craven
ship
it
swung
back
and
forth
in
space
like
a
mighty
cosmic
pendulum
breathlessly
he
watched
the
ship
was
still
in
the
grip
of
the
space
field
greg
he
shouted
we
got
him
he
raced
back
to
the
control
panel
snapped
a
glance
at
the
speed
dial
the
needle
was
rising
rapidly
now
a
full
mile
a
second
within
another
fifteen
minutes
it
had
climbed
to
a
mile
and
a
half
the
was
starting
to
go
places
the
engines
still
howled
straining
shrieking
roaring
their
defiance
in
an
hour
the
needle
indicated
the
speed
of
four
miles
a
second
two
hours
later
it
was
ten
and
rising
visibly
as
jupiter
fell
far
behind
and
the
sun
became
little
more
than
a
glowing
cinder
russ
swung
the
controls
to
provide
side
acceleration
and
the
two
ships
swung
far
to
the
rear
of
neptune
they
would
pass
that
massive
planet
at
the
safe
distance
of
a
full
hundred
million
miles
he
wo
even
make
a
pass
at
it
said
greg
he
knows
he
licked
probably
trying
to
store
some
more
power
suggested
russ
sweet
chance
he
has
to
do
that
declared
greg
look
at
that
needle
walk
will
you
we
hit
the
speed
of
light
in
a
few
more
hours
and
after
that
he
may
just
as
well
shut
off
his
lens
there
just
wo
be
any
radiation
for
him
to
catch
craven
did
make
a
try
at
neptune
the
planet
was
far
away
when
they
intersected
its
orbit
furthermore
a
wall
of
darkness
had
closed
in
about
the
ships
they
were
going
three
times
as
fast
as
light
and
the
speed
was
still
accelerating
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
the
and
its
trailing
captive
sped
doggedly
outward
into
space
out
into
the
absolute
wastes
of
interstellar
space
where
the
stars
were
flecks
of
light
like
tiny
eyes
watching
from
very
far
away
russ
lounged
in
the
control
chair
and
stared
out
the
vision
plate
there
was
nothing
to
see
nothing
to
do
there
had
been
anything
to
see
or
do
for
days
the
controls
were
locked
at
maximum
and
the
engines
still
hammered
their
roaring
song
of
speed
and
power
before
them
stretched
an
empty
gulf
that
probably
never
before
had
been
traversed
by
any
intelligence
certainly
not
by
man
out
into
the
mystery
of
interstellar
space
only
it
did
seem
mysterious
it
was
very
commonplace
and
ordinary
almost
monotonous
russ
gripped
his
pipe
and
chuckled
there
had
been
a
day
when
men
had
maintained
one
could
go
faster
than
light
also
men
had
claimed
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
force
nature
to
give
up
the
secret
of
material
energy
but
here
they
were
speeding
along
faster
than
light
their
engines
roaring
with
the
power
of
material
energy
they
were
plowing
a
new
space
road
staking
out
a
new
path
across
the
deserts
of
space
pioneering
far
beyond
the
frontier
greg
steps
sounded
across
the
room
we
gone
a
long
way
russ
maybe
we
better
begin
to
slow
down
a
bit
yes
agreed
russ
he
leaned
forward
and
grasped
the
controls
slow
down
now
he
said
sudden
silence
smote
the
ship
their
ears
accustomed
for
days
to
the
throaty
roarings
of
the
engines
rang
with
the
torture
of
no
sound
long
minutes
and
then
new
sounds
began
to
be
heard
the
soft
humming
of
the
single
engine
that
provided
power
for
the
interior
apparatus
and
the
maintenance
of
the
outer
screens
soon
as
we
slow
down
below
the
speed
of
light
said
greg
we
throw
the
televisor
on
craven
ship
and
learn
what
we
can
about
his
apparatus
no
use
trying
it
now
for
we
could
use
it
because
in
the
same
space
condition
it
uses
in
normal
operation
in
fact
laughed
russ
we
ca
do
much
of
anything
except
move
energies
simply
ca
pass
through
this
space
we
in
we
marooned
greg
sat
down
in
a
chair
gazed
solemnly
at
russ
just
what
was
our
top
speed
he
demanded
russ
grinned
ten
thousand
times
the
speed
of
light
he
said
greg
whistled
soundlessly
a
long
way
from
home
far
away
the
stars
were
tiny
pinpoints
like
little
crystals
shining
by
the
reflection
of
a
light
pinpoints
of
light
and
shimmering
masses
of
lacy
silver
star
dust
that
seemed
ghostly
and
strange
but
was
in
reality
the
massing
of
many
million
mighty
stars
and
great
empty
black
spaces
where
there
was
not
a
single
light
where
the
dark
went
on
and
on
and
did
not
stop
greg
exhaled
his
breath
softly
well
we
here
wherever
that
might
be
amended
russ
there
were
no
familiar
constellations
not
a
single
familiar
star
every
sign
post
of
the
space
they
had
known
was
wiped
out
there
really
are
any
brilliant
stars
said
russ
none
at
all
we
must
be
in
a
sort
of
hole
in
space
a
place
that
relatively
empty
of
any
stars
greg
nodded
soberly
good
thing
we
have
those
mechanical
shadows
without
them
we
never
find
our
way
back
home
but
we
have
several
that
will
lead
us
back
outside
the
vision
panel
they
could
see
craven
ship
freed
now
of
the
space
field
it
was
floating
slowly
still
under
the
grip
of
the
momentum
they
had
built
up
in
their
dash
across
space
it
was
so
close
that
they
could
see
the
lettering
across
its
bow
so
they
call
it
the
said
russ
greg
nodded
guess
it
about
time
we
talk
to
them
i
afraid
getting
pretty
nervous
do
you
have
any
idea
where
we
are
demanded
ludwig
stutsman
craven
shook
his
head
no
more
idea
than
you
have
manning
snaked
us
across
billions
of
miles
clear
out
of
the
solar
system
into
interstellar
space
take
a
look
at
those
stars
and
you
get
some
idea
spencer
chambers
stroked
his
gray
mustache
asked
calmly
what
do
you
figure
our
chances
are
of
getting
back
that
something
we
know
more
about
later
said
craven
look
too
bright
right
now
i
not
worrying
about
that
what
wondering
about
is
what
manning
and
page
are
going
to
do
now
that
they
have
us
out
here
i
thought
you
be
said
a
voice
that
came
out
of
clear
air
they
stared
at
the
place
from
which
the
voice
had
seemed
to
come
there
was
a
slight
refraction
in
the
air
then
swiftly
a
man
took
shape
it
was
manning
he
stood
before
them
smiling
hello
manning
said
craven
i
figured
you
pay
us
a
call
when
you
got
around
to
it
look
here
snarled
stutsman
but
he
stopped
when
chambers
hand
fell
upon
his
shoulder
gripped
it
hard
got
plenty
of
air
asked
greg
air
sure
atmosphere
machines
working
perfectly
craven
replied
fine
said
greg
how
about
food
and
water
plenty
of
both
plenty
said
craven
look
here
manning
broke
in
chambers
where
all
this
questioning
leading
what
have
you
got
up
your
sleeve
just
wanted
to
be
sure
greg
told
him
would
hate
to
have
you
fellows
starve
on
me
or
go
thirsty
would
want
to
come
back
and
find
you
all
dead
come
back
asked
chambers
wonderingly
i
afraid
i
do
understand
is
this
a
joke
of
some
sort
no
joke
said
greg
grimly
i
thought
you
might
have
guessed
going
to
leave
you
here
leave
us
here
roared
stutsman
keep
your
shirt
on
snapped
greg
just
for
a
while
until
we
can
go
back
to
the
solar
system
and
finish
a
little
job
we
doing
then
come
back
and
get
you
craven
grimaced
i
thought
it
would
be
something
like
that
he
squinted
at
manning
through
the
thick
lenses
you
never
miss
a
bet
do
you
greg
laughed
i
try
not
to
a
little
silence
fell
upon
the
three
men
and
manning
image
greg
broke
it
how
about
your
energy
collector
he
asked
craven
will
it
maintain
the
ship
out
here
you
get
cosmic
rays
not
too
much
else
i
afraid
craven
grinned
wryly
you
right
but
we
can
get
along
the
accumulators
are
practically
drained
though
and
we
wo
be
able
to
store
anything
would
you
mind
shooting
us
over
just
a
little
power
enough
to
charge
the
accumulators
a
little
for
emergency
use
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
almost
apprehensively
there
might
be
an
emergency
out
here
you
know
nobody
knows
anything
about
this
place
i
give
you
a
little
power
greg
agreed
thank
you
very
much
said
craven
half
in
mockery
no
doubt
you
think
yourself
quite
smart
manning
getting
us
out
here
you
know
you
have
us
stranded
that
we
ca
collect
more
than
enough
power
to
live
on
that
why
i
did
it
greg
said
and
vanished
craven
watched
the
gather
speed
and
tear
swiftly
through
the
black
saw
it
grow
tiny
and
then
disappear
entirely
either
swallowed
by
the
distance
or
snapping
into
the
strange
that
existed
beyond
the
speed
of
light
he
turned
from
the
window
chuckling
stutsman
snarled
at
him
what
so
funny
the
scientist
glared
at
the
wolfish
face
and
without
speaking
walked
to
the
desk
and
sat
down
he
reached
for
pencil
and
paper
chambers
walked
over
to
watch
him
you
found
something
doctor
he
said
quietly
craven
laughed
throatily
yes
i
have
i
found
a
lot
manning
thinks
he
can
keep
us
out
here
but
he
wrong
we
be
in
the
solar
system
less
than
a
week
after
he
gets
there
chambers
stifled
a
gasp
tried
to
speak
calmly
you
mean
this
of
course
i
mean
it
i
do
waste
my
time
with
foolish
jokes
you
have
the
secret
of
material
energy
not
that
the
scientist
growled
but
i
have
something
else
as
valuable
i
have
the
secret
of
manning
drive
i
know
what
it
is
that
enables
him
to
exceed
the
speed
of
light
to
go
ten
thousand
times
as
fast
as
light
the
lord
knows
how
much
faster
if
he
wanted
to
no
ordinary
drive
would
do
that
said
chambers
it
would
take
more
than
power
to
make
a
ship
go
that
fast
you
bet
your
life
it
would
and
manning
is
the
boy
who
got
it
he
uses
a
space
field
i
think
i
can
duplicate
it
and
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
do
this
work
about
a
week
craven
told
him
perhaps
a
little
longer
perhaps
a
little
less
but
once
we
go
we
go
as
fast
as
manning
does
we
be
short
on
power
but
i
think
i
can
do
something
about
that
too
chambers
took
a
chair
beside
the
desk
but
do
we
know
the
way
home
we
can
find
it
said
craven
but
there
are
no
familiar
constellations
objected
chambers
he
dragged
us
out
so
far
that
there
is
a
single
star
that
any
one
of
us
can
identify
i
said
i
find
the
solar
system
craven
declared
impatiently
and
i
will
manning
started
out
for
it
did
he
i
saw
the
way
he
went
the
sun
is
a
type
g
star
and
all
i
do
is
look
for
a
type
g
star
but
there
may
be
more
than
one
type
g
star
objected
the
financier
probably
are
craven
agreed
but
there
are
other
ways
of
finding
the
sun
and
identifying
it
he
volunteered
no
further
information
went
back
to
work
with
the
pad
and
pencil
chambers
rose
wearily
from
his
chair
tell
me
when
you
know
what
we
can
do
he
said
sure
craven
grunted
that
the
sun
said
craven
that
faint
star
between
those
two
brighter
ones
are
you
sure
of
it
demanded
stutsman
of
course
i
do
make
blunders
it
the
only
type
g
star
in
that
direction
suggested
chambers
helpfully
not
that
either
declared
craven
in
fact
there
are
several
type
g
stars
i
examined
them
all
and
i
know
i
right
how
do
you
know
challenged
stutsman
spectroscopic
examination
that
collector
field
of
ours
gathers
energy
just
like
a
burning
glass
you
seen
a
burning
glass
have
you
he
stared
at
stutsman
directing
the
question
at
him
stutsman
shuffled
awkwardly
unhappily
well
craven
went
on
i
used
that
for
a
telescope
gathered
the
light
from
the
suns
and
analyzed
it
of
course
it
did
act
like
a
real
telescope
produce
an
image
or
anything
like
that
but
it
was
ideal
for
spectroscopic
work
they
waited
for
him
to
explain
finally
he
continued
all
of
the
stars
i
examined
were
just
type
g
stars
nothing
else
but
there
was
a
difference
in
one
of
them
first
the
spectroscope
showed
lines
of
reflected
light
passing
through
oxygen
and
hydrogen
water
vapor
and
carbon
dioxide
pure
planetary
phenomena
never
found
on
a
star
itself
also
it
showed
that
a
certain
per
cent
of
the
light
was
polarized
now
remember
that
i
examined
it
for
a
long
time
and
i
found
out
something
else
from
the
length
of
observation
which
convinces
me
the
light
varied
with
a
periodic
irregularity
the
chronometers
working
exactly
right
out
here
so
i
ca
give
you
any
explanation
in
terms
of
hours
but
i
find
a
number
of
regularly
recurring
changes
in
light
intensity
and
character
and
that
proves
the
presence
of
a
number
of
planetary
bodies
circling
the
star
that
the
only
way
one
could
explain
the
fluctuations
for
the
star
is
a
steady
type
it
does
vary
greatly
and
has
no
light
fluctuations
to
speak
of
not
like
the
cepheid
and
mira
types
and
that
proves
it
our
sun
asked
chambers
craven
nodded
fairly
definitely
i
say
how
far
away
is
it
stutsman
wanted
to
know
craven
snorted
you
would
ask
something
like
that
but
declared
stutsman
there
are
ways
of
measuring
how
far
a
star
is
away
from
any
point
measuring
both
the
distance
and
the
size
of
the
star
okay
agreed
craven
you
find
me
something
solid
and
within
reach
that
measurable
something
preferably
about
million
miles
or
so
across
then
i
tell
you
how
far
we
are
from
the
sun
this
ship
is
not
in
an
orbit
it
not
fixed
in
space
i
have
no
accurate
way
of
measuring
distances
and
angles
simultaneously
and
accurately
especially
angles
as
small
as
these
would
be
craven
and
stutsman
glared
at
one
another
it
a
long
way
however
you
look
at
it
the
financier
said
if
going
to
get
there
we
have
to
start
as
soon
as
possible
how
soon
can
we
start
doctor
very
soon
i
have
the
gravity
concentration
field
developed
and
manning
left
me
just
enough
power
to
get
a
good
start
he
chuckled
took
off
his
glasses
wiped
the
lenses
and
put
them
back
on
again
imagine
him
giving
me
that
power
but
after
we
use
up
that
power
what
are
we
going
to
do
demanded
chambers
this
collector
lens
of
yours
wo
furnish
us
enough
to
keep
going
you
right
craven
conceded
but
we
be
able
to
get
more
build
up
what
speed
we
can
and
then
we
shut
off
the
drive
and
let
momentum
carry
us
along
in
the
meantime
our
collector
will
gather
power
for
us
we
advancing
toward
the
source
of
radiation
now
instead
of
away
from
it
out
here
where
there
little
gravity
stress
fewer
conflicting
lines
of
gravitation
we
be
able
to
spread
out
the
field
widen
it
make
it
thousands
of
miles
across
and
the
new
will
be
a
help
as
well
how
are
the
coming
asked
chambers
craven
grinned
we
have
a
bank
of
them
in
within
a
few
hours
and
replace
the
others
as
fast
as
we
can
i
have
practically
the
whole
crew
at
work
on
them
manning
does
know
it
but
he
found
the
limit
of
those
when
he
was
heaving
energy
at
us
back
in
the
solar
system
he
blistered
them
i
would
have
thought
it
possible
but
it
was
you
have
to
hand
it
to
manning
and
page
they
are
a
couple
of
smart
men
to
the
eye
there
was
only
one
slight
difference
between
the
old
cells
and
the
new
ones
the
new
type
cell
when
on
no
load
appeared
milky
white
whereas
the
old
cells
on
no
load
were
silvery
the
granular
surface
of
the
new
units
was
responsible
for
the
difference
in
appearance
for
each
minute
section
of
the
surface
was
covered
with
even
more
minute
metallic
hexagonal
pyramids
and
prisms
just
a
little
matter
of
variation
in
the
alloy
craven
explained
crystalization
of
the
alloy
forming
those
little
prisms
and
pyramids
as
a
result
you
get
a
surface
thousands
of
times
greater
than
in
the
old
type
helps
you
absorb
every
bit
of
the
energy
the
arrowed
swiftly
starward
driving
ahead
with
terrific
momentum
while
the
collector
lens
sweeping
up
the
oncoming
radiations
charged
the
great
banks
of
accumulators
the
star
toward
which
they
were
heading
was
still
pale
but
the
two
brighter
stars
to
either
side
blazed
like
fiery
jewels
against
the
black
of
space
you
say
we
be
only
a
week
or
so
behind
manning
asked
chambers
craven
looked
at
the
financier
his
eyes
narrowed
behind
the
heavy
lenses
he
sucked
in
his
loose
lips
and
turned
once
again
to
the
control
board
perhaps
a
little
longer
he
admitted
finally
we
losing
time
having
to
go
along
on
momentum
in
order
to
collect
power
but
the
nearer
we
get
to
those
stars
the
more
power
we
have
and
we
be
able
to
move
faster
chambers
drummed
idly
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
thinking
perhaps
there
time
yet
he
said
half
to
himself
with
the
power
we
have
within
the
solar
system
we
can
stop
manning
and
the
revolution
we
can
gain
control
again
craven
was
silent
watching
the
dials
manning
might
even
pass
us
on
the
way
back
to
look
for
us
chambers
went
on
he
thinks
we
still
out
there
he
would
expect
to
find
us
where
we
are
light
years
from
where
we
started
craven
shot
him
a
curious
look
i
would
be
too
sure
of
that
manning
has
a
string
of
some
sort
tied
to
us
he
got
us
tagged
good
and
proper
he
always
been
able
to
find
us
again
no
matter
where
we
were
i
have
a
hunch
he
find
us
again
even
way
out
here
chambers
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
really
does
matter
just
so
we
get
close
enough
to
the
sun
so
we
can
load
those
accumulators
and
jam
the
full
with
a
load
like
that
we
can
beat
him
hands
down
the
financier
fell
into
a
silence
he
stared
out
of
the
vision
plate
watching
the
stars
still
far
away
but
so
much
nearer
than
they
had
been
his
brain
hummed
with
dreams
old
dreams
revived
again
old
dreams
of
conquest
and
of
empire
dreams
of
a
power
that
held
a
solar
system
in
its
grip
craven
broke
his
chain
of
thoughts
where
our
friend
stutsman
i
have
seen
him
around
lately
chambers
chuckled
he
sulking
he
seems
to
have
gotten
the
idea
neither
one
of
us
likes
him
he
been
spending
most
of
his
time
back
in
the
engine
room
with
the
crew
were
you
talking
about
me
asked
a
silky
voice
they
spun
around
to
see
stutsman
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
control
room
his
face
was
twisted
into
a
wolfish
grin
and
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
heat
gun
chambers
voice
was
sharp
like
the
note
of
a
clanging
bell
this
stutsman
face
twisted
into
an
even
more
exaggerated
grin
this
he
said
is
mutiny
i
taking
over
he
laughed
at
them
no
use
calling
the
crew
they
with
me
damn
you
shouted
chambers
taking
a
step
forward
he
halted
as
stutsman
jerked
the
pistol
up
forget
it
chambers
you
just
second
man
from
now
on
maybe
not
even
second
man
you
tried
out
this
dictator
business
and
you
bungled
it
you
went
soft
you
taking
orders
from
me
from
now
on
no
questions
no
back
talk
you
do
as
i
say
and
maybe
you
wo
get
hurt
you
mad
stutsman
cried
chambers
you
ca
get
away
with
this
stutsman
barked
out
a
brittle
laugh
who
is
going
to
stop
me
the
people
chambers
shouted
at
him
the
people
will
they
allow
this
when
you
get
back
to
the
solar
system
stutsman
growled
stepping
toward
chambers
pistol
leveled
the
people
wo
have
anything
to
say
about
this
i
rule
the
solar
system
the
way
i
want
to
there
wo
be
anyone
else
who
have
a
thing
to
say
about
it
so
you
dreamed
of
empire
did
you
you
dreamed
of
a
solar
dictatorship
well
watch
me
i
build
a
real
empire
but
i
be
the
head
of
it
not
you
craven
sat
down
in
his
chair
crossed
his
knees
just
what
do
you
plan
to
do
dictator
stutsman
stutsman
fairly
foamed
at
the
mouth
over
the
insolence
of
voice
i
smash
manning
first
i
wipe
him
out
this
ship
will
do
it
you
said
yourself
it
would
you
have
ten
times
the
power
he
has
and
then
craven
raised
a
hand
and
waved
him
into
silence
so
you
plan
to
reach
the
solar
system
do
you
you
plan
to
meet
manning
and
destroy
his
ship
nice
plan
what
wrong
with
it
challenged
stutsman
nothing
said
craven
calmly
absolutely
nothing
at
all
that
we
may
never
reach
the
solar
stutsman
seemed
to
sag
the
wolfish
snarl
on
his
lips
drooped
his
eyes
stared
then
with
an
effort
he
braced
himself
what
do
you
mean
why
ca
we
he
gestured
toward
the
vision
plate
toward
the
tiny
yellow
star
between
the
two
brighter
stars
that
said
craven
is
our
sun
it
has
planets
but
it
is
our
sun
chambers
stepped
quickly
to
craven
reached
out
a
hand
and
hoisted
him
from
the
chair
shook
him
you
must
be
joking
that
has
to
be
the
sun
craven
shrugged
free
of
chambers
clutch
spoke
in
an
even
voice
i
never
joke
we
made
a
mistake
that
all
i
had
meant
to
tell
you
yet
i
had
intended
to
get
in
close
to
the
star
and
take
on
a
full
load
of
power
and
then
try
to
locate
our
sun
but
i
afraid
it
a
hopeless
task
a
hopeless
task
shrieked
stutsman
you
are
trying
to
trick
me
this
is
put
up
between
the
two
of
you
that
the
sun
over
there
i
know
it
is
it
is
said
craven
manning
tricked
us
he
started
off
in
the
wrong
direction
he
made
us
think
he
was
going
straight
back
to
the
solar
system
but
he
did
he
circled
and
went
in
some
other
direction
the
scientist
eyed
stutsman
calmly
stutsman
knuckles
were
white
with
the
grip
he
had
upon
the
gun
we
lost
craven
told
him
looking
squarely
at
him
we
may
never
find
the
solar
system
the
revolution
was
over
interplanetary
officials
and
army
heads
had
fled
to
the
sanctuary
of
earth
interplanetary
was
ended
ended
forever
for
on
every
world
including
earth
material
energy
engines
were
humming
the
people
had
power
to
burn
to
throw
away
power
so
cheap
that
it
was
practically
worthless
as
a
commodity
but
invaluable
as
a
way
to
a
new
life
a
greater
life
a
fuller
life
a
broader
destiny
for
the
human
race
interplanetary
stocks
were
worthless
the
mighty
power
plants
on
venus
and
mercury
were
idle
the
only
remaining
tangible
asset
were
the
fleets
of
spaceships
used
less
than
a
month
before
to
ship
the
accumulators
to
the
outer
worlds
to
bring
them
sunward
for
recharging
patents
protecting
the
rights
to
the
material
energy
engines
had
been
obtained
from
every
government
throughout
the
solar
system
new
governments
were
being
formed
on
the
wreckage
of
the
old
john
moore
mallory
already
had
been
inaugurated
as
president
of
the
jovian
confederacy
the
elections
on
mars
and
venus
would
be
held
within
a
week
mercury
its
usefulness
gone
with
the
smashing
of
the
accumulator
trade
had
been
abandoned
no
human
foot
now
trod
its
surface
its
mighty
domes
were
empty
it
went
its
way
as
it
had
gone
for
billions
of
years
a
little
burned
out
worthless
planet
ignored
and
shunned
for
a
brief
moment
it
had
known
the
conquering
tread
of
mankind
had
played
its
part
in
the
commerce
of
the
worlds
but
now
it
had
reverted
to
its
former
state
a
lonely
wanderer
of
the
regions
near
the
sun
a
pariah
among
the
other
planets
russell
page
looked
across
the
desk
at
gregory
manning
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
dug
the
pipe
out
of
his
jacket
pocket
it
finished
greg
he
said
greg
nodded
solemnly
watching
russ
fill
the
bowl
and
apply
the
match
except
for
the
small
crew
they
were
alone
in
the
john
moore
mallory
and
the
others
were
on
their
own
worlds
forming
their
own
governments
carrying
out
the
dictates
of
the
people
men
who
would
go
down
in
solar
history
the
hung
just
off
callisto
russ
looked
out
at
the
mighty
moon
saw
the
lonely
stretches
of
its
surface
saw
the
silvery
spot
that
was
the
dome
of
ranthoor
all
done
said
greg
except
for
one
thing
go
out
and
get
chambers
and
the
others
said
russ
puffing
at
the
pipe
greg
nodded
we
may
as
well
get
started
russ
rose
slowly
went
to
the
wall
cabinet
and
lifted
out
a
box
the
mechanical
shadow
with
its
tiny
space
field
surrounding
the
fleck
of
steel
that
would
lead
them
to
the
carefully
he
lifted
the
machine
from
its
resting
place
and
set
it
on
the
desk
bending
over
it
he
watched
the
dials
suddenly
he
whistled
greg
they
moved
they
are
where
we
left
them
greg
sprang
to
his
side
and
stared
at
the
readings
they
moving
farther
away
from
us
out
into
space
where
can
they
be
going
russ
straightened
scowling
pulling
at
the
pipe
they
probably
found
another
star
and
are
heading
for
that
they
must
think
it
is
old
sol
that
sounds
like
it
said
greg
we
spun
all
over
the
map
to
throw
craven
off
and
looped
several
times
so
he
lose
all
sense
of
direction
naturally
he
would
be
lost
but
he
evidently
got
something
russ
pointed
out
we
left
him
marooned
dead
center
out
where
he
did
have
too
much
radiation
and
could
get
leverage
on
any
single
body
yet
he
moving
and
getting
farther
away
all
the
time
he
solved
our
gravitation
concentration
screen
said
greg
he
tricked
us
into
giving
him
power
to
build
it
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
for
a
long
minute
well
said
russ
that
that
craven
and
chambers
and
stutsman
the
three
villains
all
lost
in
space
heading
for
the
wrong
star
hopelessly
lost
maybe
they
never
find
their
way
back
he
stopped
and
relit
his
pipe
an
aching
silence
fell
in
the
room
poetic
justice
said
russ
hail
and
farewell
greg
rubbed
his
fist
indecisively
along
the
desk
i
ca
do
it
russ
we
took
them
out
there
we
marooned
them
we
have
to
get
them
back
or
i
could
sleep
nights
russ
laughed
quietly
watching
the
bleak
face
that
stared
at
him
i
knew
that
what
you
say
he
knocked
out
the
pipe
crushed
a
fleck
of
burning
tobacco
with
his
boot
pocketing
the
pipe
he
walked
to
the
control
panel
sat
down
and
reached
for
the
lever
the
engines
hummed
louder
and
louder
the
darted
spaceward
it
too
late
now
said
chambers
by
the
time
we
reach
that
planetary
system
and
charge
our
accumulators
manning
and
page
will
have
everything
under
control
back
in
the
solar
system
even
if
we
could
locate
the
star
that
was
our
sun
we
would
have
a
chance
to
get
there
in
time
too
bad
craven
said
and
wagged
his
head
looking
like
a
solemn
owl
too
bad
dictator
stutsman
wo
have
a
chance
to
strut
his
stuff
stutsman
started
to
say
something
and
thought
better
of
it
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
from
his
belt
hung
a
heat
pistol
chambers
eyed
the
pistol
with
disgust
there
no
point
in
playing
soldier
we
are
going
to
try
to
upset
your
mutiny
so
far
your
taking
over
the
ship
has
made
any
difference
to
us
so
why
should
we
fight
you
it
is
going
to
make
any
difference
either
said
craven
because
there
are
just
two
things
that
will
happen
to
us
we
either
lost
forever
will
never
find
our
way
back
will
spend
the
rest
of
our
days
wandering
from
star
to
star
or
manning
will
come
out
and
take
us
by
the
ear
and
lead
us
home
again
chambers
started
leaned
forward
and
fastened
his
steely
eyes
on
craven
do
you
really
think
he
could
find
us
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
craven
replied
i
do
know
how
he
does
it
but
i
convinced
he
can
probably
however
he
find
that
we
are
lost
and
get
rid
of
us
that
way
no
said
chambers
you
wrong
there
manning
would
do
that
he
come
to
get
us
i
do
know
why
he
should
snapped
craven
because
he
that
sort
of
man
declared
chambers
what
you
going
to
do
when
he
does
get
out
here
demanded
stutsman
fall
on
his
neck
and
kiss
him
chambers
smiled
stroked
his
mustache
why
no
he
said
i
imagine
we
fight
we
give
him
everything
we
got
and
he
do
the
same
it
would
seem
natural
if
we
did
you
damned
right
we
will
growled
stutsman
because
i
running
this
show
you
seem
to
keep
forgetting
that
we
have
power
enough
when
we
get
those
accumulators
filled
to
wipe
him
out
and
that
is
exactly
what
i
going
to
do
fine
said
craven
mockingly
just
fine
there
just
one
thing
you
forget
manning
is
the
only
man
who
can
lead
us
back
to
the
solar
system
hell
stormed
stutsman
that
does
make
any
difference
i
find
my
way
back
there
some
way
you
afraid
of
manning
chambers
challenged
stutsman
hand
went
down
to
the
heat
pistol
grip
his
eyes
glazed
and
his
face
twisted
itself
into
utter
hatred
i
do
know
why
i
keep
on
letting
you
live
craven
is
valuable
to
me
i
ca
kill
him
but
you
are
you
are
worth
a
damn
to
anyone
chambers
matched
his
stare
stutsman
hand
dropped
from
the
pistol
and
he
slouched
to
his
feet
walked
from
the
room
afraid
of
manning
he
laughed
a
hollow
gurgling
laugh
afraid
of
manning
but
he
was
within
his
brain
hammered
a
single
sentence
words
he
had
heard
manning
speak
as
he
watched
over
the
television
set
at
manning
mocking
invitation
words
that
beat
into
his
brain
and
seared
his
reason
and
made
his
soul
shrivel
and
grow
small
manning
talking
to
scorio
talking
to
him
but
grimly
promise
you
that
we
take
care
of
stutsman
manning
had
taken
scorio
and
his
gangsters
one
by
one
and
sent
them
to
far
corners
of
the
solar
system
one
out
to
the
dreaded
vulcan
fleet
one
to
the
outpost
one
to
the
titan
prison
and
one
to
the
on
vesta
while
scorio
had
gone
to
a
little
mountain
set
in
a
venus
swamp
they
had
a
chance
they
had
been
locked
within
a
force
shell
and
shunted
through
millions
of
miles
of
space
no
trial
no
hearing
nothing
just
terrible
unrelenting
judgment
promise
you
that
we
take
care
of
stutsman
craven
only
a
few
billion
miles
ahead
now
said
gregory
manning
with
our
margin
of
speed
we
should
overhaul
him
in
a
few
more
hours
he
is
still
short
on
power
but
he
remedying
that
rapidly
getting
nearer
to
that
sun
every
minute
running
in
toward
it
as
he
is
he
tends
to
sweep
up
outpouring
radiations
that
helps
him
collect
a
whole
lot
more
than
he
would
under
ordinary
circumstances
russ
sitting
before
the
controls
pipe
clenched
in
his
teeth
watching
the
dials
nodded
soberly
all
i
afraid
of
he
said
is
that
he
get
too
close
to
that
sun
before
we
catch
up
with
him
if
he
gets
close
enough
so
he
can
fill
those
accumulators
he
pack
a
bigger
wallop
than
we
do
it
all
be
in
one
bolt
of
course
for
his
power
is
continuous
like
ours
he
has
to
collect
it
slowly
but
when
he
really
loaded
he
can
give
us
aces
and
still
win
i
hate
to
take
everything
he
could
pack
into
those
accumulators
greg
shuddered
so
would
i
the
was
exceeding
the
speed
of
light
was
enveloped
in
the
mysterious
darkness
that
characterized
the
speed
they
could
see
nothing
outside
the
ship
for
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
the
tiny
mechanical
shadow
occupying
a
place
of
honor
on
the
navigation
board
kept
them
informed
of
the
position
and
the
distance
of
the
greg
lolled
in
his
chair
watching
russ
i
do
think
we
need
to
worry
about
him
throwing
the
entire
load
of
the
accumulators
at
us
he
said
he
would
dare
load
those
accumulators
to
peak
capacity
he
got
to
leave
enough
carrying
capacity
in
the
cells
to
handle
any
jolts
we
send
him
and
he
knows
we
can
send
him
plenty
he
has
to
keep
that
handling
margin
at
all
times
over
and
above
what
he
takes
in
for
power
because
his
absorption
screen
is
also
a
defensive
screen
and
he
has
to
use
some
power
to
keep
our
television
apparatus
out
russ
chuckled
i
suppose
at
that
we
have
him
plenty
worried
the
thunder
of
the
engines
filled
the
control
room
for
days
now
that
thunder
had
been
in
their
ears
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
now
hardly
noticed
it
ten
mighty
engines
driving
the
at
a
pace
no
other
ship
had
ever
obtained
except
possibly
the
although
lack
of
power
should
have
held
ship
down
to
a
lower
speed
craven
would
have
dared
to
build
up
the
acceleration
they
had
now
attained
for
he
would
have
drained
his
banks
and
been
unable
to
charge
them
again
maybe
he
wo
fight
said
russ
maybe
he
figured
out
by
this
time
that
he
heading
for
the
wrong
star
he
may
be
glad
to
see
us
and
follow
us
back
to
the
solar
system
no
chance
of
that
craven
and
chambers
wo
pass
up
a
chance
for
a
fight
they
give
us
a
few
wallops
if
only
for
the
appearance
of
things
we
crawling
up
all
the
time
said
russ
if
we
can
catch
him
within
four
or
five
billion
miles
of
the
star
he
wo
be
too
tough
to
handle
be
getting
plenty
of
radiations
even
then
but
not
quite
as
much
as
he
would
like
to
have
he
have
to
start
decelerating
pretty
soon
greg
declared
he
run
the
chance
of
smashing
into
the
planetary
system
at
the
speed
going
he
wo
want
to
waste
too
much
power
using
his
field
as
a
brake
because
he
must
know
by
this
time
that
we
after
him
and
he
want
what
power
he
has
to
throw
at
us
hours
passed
the
crept
nearer
and
nearer
suddenly
seemed
to
leap
ahead
as
the
began
deceleration
keep
giving
her
all
you
got
greg
urged
russ
we
got
plenty
of
power
for
braking
we
can
overhaul
him
and
stop
in
a
fraction
of
the
time
he
does
russ
nodded
grimly
the
distance
indicator
needle
on
the
mechanical
shadow
slipped
off
rapidly
greg
leaping
from
his
chair
hung
over
it
breathlessly
i
think
he
said
we
better
slow
down
now
if
we
do
we
be
inside
the
planetary
system
how
far
out
is
craven
asked
russ
not
far
enough
greg
replied
unhappily
he
ca
be
more
than
three
billion
miles
from
the
star
and
that
star
hot
a
class
g
all
right
but
a
good
deal
younger
than
old
sol
we
let
them
know
we
arrived
grinned
greg
he
sent
a
stabbing
beam
of
half
a
billion
horsepower
slashing
at
the
the
other
ship
staggered
but
steadied
itself
they
know
said
russ
cryptically
from
his
position
in
front
of
the
vision
plate
we
shook
them
up
a
bit
they
waited
nothing
happened
greg
scratched
his
head
maybe
you
were
right
maybe
they
do
want
to
fight
together
they
watched
the
it
was
still
moving
in
toward
the
distant
sun
as
if
nothing
had
happened
we
see
said
greg
back
at
the
controls
he
threw
out
a
gigantic
tractor
beam
catching
the
other
ship
in
a
net
of
forces
that
visibly
cut
its
speed
space
suddenly
vomited
lashing
flame
that
slapped
back
and
licked
and
crawled
in
living
streamers
over
the
surface
of
the
the
engines
moaned
in
their
valiant
battle
to
keep
up
the
outer
screen
the
pungent
odor
of
ozone
filtered
into
the
control
room
the
whole
ship
was
bucking
and
vibrating
creaking
as
if
it
were
being
pulled
apart
so
they
do
want
to
fight
eh
hooted
russ
greg
gritted
his
teeth
they
snapped
the
tractor
beam
they
have
power
there
russ
declared
too
much
said
greg
more
power
than
they
have
any
right
to
have
his
hand
went
out
to
the
lever
on
the
board
and
pulled
it
back
a
beam
smashed
out
with
the
engines
screaming
drive
behind
it
billions
of
horsepower
driving
with
unleashed
ferocity
at
the
other
ship
greg
hand
spun
a
dial
while
the
generators
roared
thunderous
defiance
i
giving
them
the
radiation
scale
said
greg
the
was
staggering
under
the
terrific
bombardment
but
its
screen
was
handling
every
ounce
of
the
power
that
greg
was
pouring
into
it
their
ca
handle
that
cried
russ
no
would
handle
all
that
stuff
you
shooting
at
them
unless
unless
what
unless
craven
has
improved
on
them
we
have
to
find
out
get
the
televisor
russ
leaped
for
the
television
machine
a
moment
later
he
lifted
a
haggard
face
i
ca
get
through
he
said
craven
got
our
beams
stopped
and
now
he
has
our
television
blocked
out
greg
nodded
we
might
have
expected
that
when
he
could
scramble
our
televisors
back
in
the
jovian
worlds
he
certainly
ought
to
be
able
to
screen
his
ship
against
them
he
shoved
the
lever
clear
over
slamming
the
extreme
limit
of
power
into
the
beam
the
engines
screamed
like
demented
things
howling
and
shrieking
instantly
a
tremendous
sheet
of
solid
flame
spun
a
fiery
web
around
the
turning
it
into
a
blazing
inferno
of
lapping
leaping
fire
a
dozen
terrific
beams
billions
of
horsepower
in
each
stabbed
back
at
the
as
the
shunted
the
terrific
energy
influx
from
the
overcharged
accumulators
to
the
various
automatic
energy
discharges
the
screen
flared
in
defense
and
the
ten
great
engines
wailed
in
utter
agony
more
stabbing
flame
shot
from
the
in
slow
explosions
the
temperature
in
the
control
room
was
rising
the
ozone
was
sharp
enough
to
make
their
eyes
water
and
nostrils
burn
the
vision
glass
was
blanked
out
by
the
lapping
flames
that
crawled
and
writhed
over
the
screen
outside
the
glass
russ
tore
his
collar
open
wiped
his
face
with
his
shirt
sleeve
try
a
pure
magnetic
greg
his
face
set
and
bleak
as
a
wall
of
stone
grunted
agreement
his
fingers
danced
over
the
control
manual
suddenly
the
stars
outside
twisted
and
danced
like
stars
gone
mad
as
if
they
were
dancing
a
riotous
jig
in
space
some
uproariously
hopping
up
and
down
while
others
were
applauding
the
show
that
was
being
provided
for
their
unblinking
eyes
the
magnetic
field
was
tightening
now
twisting
the
light
from
those
distant
stars
and
bending
it
straight
again
the
reeled
like
a
drunken
thing
and
the
great
arcs
of
electric
flame
looped
madly
and
plunged
straight
for
the
field
very
heart
the
stars
danced
weirdly
in
space
again
as
the
accumulators
lashed
out
with
tremendous
force
to
oppose
the
energy
of
the
field
the
field
glowed
softly
and
disappeared
they
have
us
stopped
at
every
turn
groaned
russ
there
must
be
some
way
something
we
can
do
he
looked
at
greg
greg
grinned
without
humor
wiping
his
face
there
is
something
we
can
do
said
russ
grimly
we
should
have
thought
of
it
long
ago
he
strode
to
the
desk
reached
out
one
hand
and
drew
a
calculator
near
you
keep
them
busy
he
snapped
i
have
this
thing
figured
out
in
just
a
while
from
the
engine
rooms
came
the
roar
and
hum
of
the
laboring
units
and
the
shuddered
once
again
as
greg
grimly
hurled
one
beam
after
another
at
the
the
struck
back
using
radio
frequency
that
flamed
fiercely
against
the
outer
screen
simultaneously
the
leaped
forward
with
a
sudden
surge
of
accumulated
energy
driving
at
the
star
that
lay
not
more
than
three
billion
miles
away
greg
worked
desperately
cursing
under
his
breath
he
pulled
down
the
outer
screen
that
was
fighting
directly
against
the
radio
frequency
energy
for
energy
and
allowed
the
beam
to
strike
squarely
on
the
second
screen
the
inversion
field
that
shunted
the
major
portion
of
the
energy
impacting
against
it
through
degrees
into
another
space
the
engines
moaned
softly
and
settled
into
a
quieter
rumble
as
the
necessity
of
supplying
the
first
screen
was
eliminated
but
they
screamed
once
again
as
greg
sent
out
a
tractor
beam
that
seized
and
held
dragged
the
to
a
standstill
craven
ship
had
gained
millions
of
miles
though
and
established
a
tremendous
advantage
by
fighting
nearer
to
its
source
of
energy
russ
gasped
greg
if
you
do
get
that
scheme
of
yours
figured
out
pretty
soon
we
done
for
they
stopped
everything
we
got
they
nearer
the
sun
we
wo
stand
a
chance
if
they
make
another
break
like
that
russ
glanced
up
to
answer
but
his
mouth
fell
open
in
amazement
and
he
did
not
speak
a
streak
of
terrible
light
was
striking
at
them
from
the
blinding
white
light
and
along
that
highway
of
light
swarmed
a
horde
of
little
green
figures
like
squirming
green
amebas
swarming
toward
the
stretching
out
hungry
pseudopods
toward
the
inversion
barrier
eating
through
wherever
they
touched
holes
appeared
they
drifted
through
the
inversion
screen
easily
and
began
drilling
into
the
inner
screen
of
eating
their
way
into
the
a
state
of
matter
which
russ
and
greg
had
thought
would
resist
all
for
seconds
both
men
stood
transfixed
unable
to
believe
the
evidence
of
their
eyes
but
the
ameba
things
came
on
in
throngs
creatures
that
gnawed
and
slobbered
at
the
eating
into
it
flaking
it
away
drilling
their
way
through
it
when
they
pierced
the
they
would
cut
through
the
steel
plates
of
the
like
so
much
paper
and
more
were
coming
more
and
more
with
a
grunt
of
amazement
greg
slammed
a
beam
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
amebas
they
ate
the
beam
and
vanished
as
mistily
as
before
little
glowing
things
that
ate
and
died
but
there
were
always
more
to
take
their
place
they
overwhelmed
the
beam
and
ate
back
along
its
length
attacked
the
screen
again
they
ate
through
walls
of
force
and
walls
of
metal
and
a
rush
of
hissing
air
began
to
flame
into
ions
in
the
terrific
battle
of
energies
outside
the
russ
was
crouching
over
the
manual
of
the
televisor
board
his
breath
moaned
in
his
throat
as
his
fingers
flew
i
have
to
have
power
greg
he
said
lots
of
power
take
it
greg
replied
i
have
been
able
to
do
anything
with
it
it
is
any
use
to
me
russ
thumb
reached
out
and
tripped
the
activating
lever
the
giant
engines
shrieked
and
yowled
something
was
happening
on
the
television
screen
something
terrifying
craven
ship
seemed
to
retreat
suddenly
for
millions
of
miles
and
as
suddenly
the
appeared
on
the
screen
for
a
single
flashing
instant
the
view
held
then
it
was
gone
in
blank
grayness
for
seconds
nothing
happened
on
the
screen
unnerving
seconds
while
the
two
men
held
their
breath
the
screen
grayness
fled
and
they
looked
into
the
control
room
of
the
craven
was
hunched
in
a
chair
intent
upon
a
series
of
controls
behind
him
and
to
one
side
stood
stutsman
a
heat
pistol
dangled
from
his
hand
his
face
twisted
into
a
sneer
of
triumph
there
was
no
sign
of
chambers
you
damn
fool
craven
was
snapping
at
stutsman
you
cheating
us
out
of
the
only
chance
we
ever
had
of
getting
home
shut
up
snarled
stutsman
the
pistol
jerking
in
his
hand
have
you
got
that
apparatus
on
full
power
it
been
on
full
power
for
minutes
now
said
craven
it
must
be
eating
holes
straight
through
manning
ship
see
you
keep
it
that
way
i
really
do
need
you
any
more
anyhow
i
watched
and
i
know
all
the
tricks
i
could
carry
on
this
battle
craven
did
not
reply
merely
hunched
closer
over
the
controls
eyes
watching
flickering
dials
greg
jogged
russ
elbow
that
must
be
the
apparatus
over
there
in
the
corner
of
the
room
that
triangular
affair
a
condenser
of
some
sort
that
stuff
they
throwing
at
us
must
be
force
fields
and
they
need
a
condenser
for
that
russ
nodded
we
take
care
of
that
his
fingers
moved
swiftly
and
a
transport
beam
whipped
out
riding
the
television
beam
bands
of
force
wrapped
around
the
triangular
machine
and
wrenched
viciously
in
the
screen
the
apparatus
disappeared
simply
was
gone
it
now
lay
within
the
control
room
jerked
there
by
the
the
flood
of
dazzling
light
reaching
out
from
the
snapped
off
and
the
little
green
ameba
things
were
gone
the
shrill
whistle
of
escaping
air
stopped
as
the
eaten
screens
clamped
down
again
sealing
in
the
atmosphere
despite
the
holes
bored
through
the
metal
plates
in
the
television
screen
craven
leaped
from
his
chair
was
staring
with
stutsman
at
the
place
where
the
concentrator
had
stood
the
machine
had
been
ripped
from
a
welded
base
and
jagged
bright
torn
metal
gleamed
in
the
control
room
lights
snapped
cables
and
broken
busbars
lay
piled
about
the
room
what
happened
stutsman
was
screaming
they
heard
craven
laugh
at
the
terror
in
the
other
voice
manning
just
walked
in
and
grabbed
it
away
from
us
but
he
could
we
had
the
screen
up
he
could
get
through
craven
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
know
how
he
did
it
but
he
did
probably
he
could
clean
out
the
whole
place
if
he
wanted
to
that
a
good
idea
said
russ
judiciously
he
stripped
bank
after
bank
of
the
other
ship
from
their
moorings
wrecked
the
force
field
controls
ripped
cables
from
the
engines
and
left
the
ship
without
means
of
collecting
power
without
means
of
using
power
without
means
of
movement
of
offense
or
defense
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
the
screen
with
deep
satisfaction
that
he
decided
should
hold
them
for
a
while
he
hauled
the
pipe
out
of
his
pocket
and
filled
it
from
the
battered
leather
pouch
greg
regarded
him
with
a
quizzical
stare
you
sent
the
televisor
back
in
time
you
got
it
inside
the
before
craven
had
run
up
his
screen
and
then
you
brought
it
forward
you
guessed
it
said
russ
tamping
the
tobacco
into
the
bowl
we
should
have
thought
of
that
long
ago
we
have
a
time
factor
there
in
fact
the
whole
thing
revolves
around
time
we
move
the
televisor
we
use
the
by
giving
the
objects
we
wish
to
move
an
acceleration
in
time
greg
wrinkled
his
brow
maybe
that
means
we
can
really
investigate
the
past
or
even
the
future
can
sit
here
before
our
screen
and
see
everything
that
has
happened
everything
that
is
going
to
happen
russ
shook
his
head
i
do
know
greg
notice
though
that
we
got
no
screen
response
until
the
televisor
came
up
out
of
the
past
and
actually
reached
the
point
which
coincided
with
the
present
that
is
the
screen
and
the
televisor
itself
have
to
be
on
the
same
time
level
for
them
to
operate
we
might
modify
the
screen
even
modify
the
televisor
so
that
we
could
travel
in
time
but
it
will
take
a
lot
of
research
a
lot
of
work
and
especially
it
will
take
a
whale
of
a
lot
of
power
we
have
the
power
said
greg
russ
moved
the
lighter
back
and
forth
over
the
tobacco
igniting
it
carefully
clouds
of
blue
smoke
swirled
around
his
head
he
spoke
out
of
the
smoke
right
now
he
said
we
better
see
how
craven
and
our
other
friends
are
getting
along
i
did
like
the
way
stutsman
was
talking
or
the
way
he
was
swinging
that
gun
around
and
chambers
was
anywhere
in
sight
there
something
screwy
about
the
entire
thing
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
demanded
stutsman
craven
grinned
at
him
that
up
to
you
remember
you
the
master
mind
around
here
you
took
over
and
said
you
were
going
to
run
things
he
waved
a
casual
hand
at
the
shattered
machines
the
apparatus
well
there
you
are
go
ahead
and
run
the
joint
but
you
will
have
to
help
pleaded
stutsman
his
face
twisted
until
it
seemed
that
he
was
suffering
intense
physical
agony
you
know
what
to
do
i
do
craven
shook
his
head
there
is
any
use
starting
manning
will
be
along
almost
anytime
now
we
wait
and
see
what
he
has
in
mind
manning
shrieked
stutsman
waving
the
pistol
wildly
always
manning
one
would
think
you
were
working
for
manning
he
the
big
shot
out
in
this
little
corner
of
space
right
now
craven
pointed
out
there
is
any
way
you
can
get
around
that
stutsman
backed
carefully
away
his
gun
came
up
and
he
looked
at
craven
appraisingly
as
if
selecting
his
targets
put
down
that
gun
said
a
voice
gregory
manning
stood
between
stutsman
and
craven
there
had
been
no
foggy
forerunner
of
his
appearance
he
had
just
snapped
out
of
empty
air
stutsman
stared
at
him
his
eyes
widening
but
the
gun
remained
steady
in
his
hand
look
out
craven
warned
greg
he
going
to
fire
and
it
will
go
right
through
me
and
hit
you
there
was
the
thump
of
a
falling
body
as
craven
hurled
himself
out
of
his
chair
hit
the
floor
and
rolled
stutsman
gun
vomited
flame
the
spouting
flame
passed
through
greg
image
blasted
against
the
chair
in
which
craven
had
sat
fused
it
until
it
fell
in
on
itself
russ
said
greg
quietly
disarm
this
fellow
before
he
hurts
somebody
an
unseen
force
reached
out
and
twisted
the
gun
from
stutsman
hand
flung
it
to
one
side
swiftly
stutsman
hands
were
forced
behind
his
back
and
held
there
by
invisible
bonds
stutsman
cried
out
tried
to
struggle
but
he
was
unable
to
move
it
was
as
if
giant
hands
had
gripped
him
were
holding
him
in
a
viselike
clutch
thanks
manning
said
craven
getting
up
off
the
floor
the
fool
would
have
shot
this
time
he
threatened
it
for
days
he
has
been
developing
a
homicidal
mania
we
do
need
to
worry
about
him
now
declared
greg
he
turned
around
to
face
craven
where
chambers
stutsman
locked
him
up
said
craven
i
imagine
he
has
the
key
in
his
pocket
locked
him
up
in
the
stateroom
chambers
jumped
him
and
tried
to
take
the
gun
away
from
him
and
stutsman
laid
him
out
hit
him
over
the
head
he
kept
chambers
locked
up
after
that
has
allowed
anyone
to
go
near
the
room
has
even
given
him
food
and
water
that
was
three
days
ago
get
the
key
out
of
his
pocket
directed
greg
go
and
see
how
chambers
is
alone
in
the
control
room
with
stutsman
greg
looked
at
him
i
have
a
score
to
settle
with
you
stutsman
he
said
i
had
intended
to
let
it
ride
but
not
now
you
ca
touch
me
blustered
stutsman
you
would
dare
what
makes
you
think
i
would
you
bluffing
you
got
a
lot
of
tricks
but
you
ca
do
the
things
you
would
like
me
to
think
you
can
you
got
chambers
and
craven
fooled
but
not
me
it
may
be
that
i
can
offer
you
definite
proof
chambers
staggered
over
the
threshold
his
clothing
was
rumpled
a
rude
bandage
was
wound
around
his
head
his
face
was
haggard
and
his
eyes
red
hello
manning
he
said
i
suppose
you
won
the
solar
system
must
be
in
your
control
by
now
he
lifted
his
hand
to
his
mustache
brushed
it
a
feeble
attempt
at
playing
the
old
role
he
acted
so
long
we
won
said
greg
quietly
but
you
wrong
about
our
being
in
control
the
governments
are
in
the
hands
of
the
people
where
they
should
be
chambers
nodded
i
see
he
mumbled
different
people
different
ideas
his
eyes
rested
on
stutsman
and
greg
saw
sudden
rage
sweep
across
the
gray
haggard
face
so
you
got
him
have
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
all
of
us
i
have
had
time
to
think
about
it
said
greg
i
principally
been
thinking
about
stutsman
here
he
mutinied
rasped
chambers
he
seized
the
ship
turned
the
crew
against
me
and
the
penalty
for
that
said
greg
quietly
is
death
death
by
walking
in
space
stutsman
writhed
within
the
bands
of
force
that
held
him
tight
his
face
contorted
no
damn
you
you
ca
do
that
not
to
me
you
ca
shut
up
roared
chambers
and
stutsman
quieted
i
was
thinking
too
said
greg
that
at
his
order
thousands
of
people
were
mercilessly
shot
down
back
in
the
solar
system
stood
against
a
wall
and
mowed
down
others
were
killed
like
wild
animals
in
the
street
thousands
of
them
he
moved
slowly
toward
stutsman
and
the
man
cringed
stutsman
he
said
you
a
butcher
you
a
stench
in
the
nostrils
of
humanity
you
are
fit
to
live
those
said
craven
are
my
sentiments
exactly
you
hate
me
screamed
stutsman
all
of
you
hate
me
you
are
doing
this
because
you
hate
me
everyone
hates
you
stutsman
said
greg
every
living
person
hates
you
you
have
a
cloud
of
hate
hanging
over
you
as
black
and
wide
as
space
the
man
closed
his
eyes
trying
to
break
free
of
the
bonds
bring
me
a
spacesuit
snapped
greg
watching
stutsman
face
craven
brought
it
and
dropped
it
at
stutsman
feet
all
right
russ
said
greg
turn
him
loose
stutsman
swayed
and
almost
fell
as
the
bands
of
force
released
him
get
into
that
suit
ordered
greg
stutsman
hesitated
but
something
he
saw
in
greg
face
made
him
lift
the
suit
step
into
it
fasten
it
about
his
body
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
he
whimpered
you
are
going
to
take
me
back
to
earth
again
are
you
you
are
going
to
make
me
stand
trial
no
said
greg
gravely
we
are
taking
you
back
to
earth
and
you
standing
trial
right
now
stutsman
read
his
fate
in
the
cold
eyes
that
stared
into
his
chattering
frightenedly
he
rushed
at
greg
plunged
through
him
collided
with
the
wall
of
the
ship
and
toppled
over
feebly
attempting
to
rise
invisible
hands
hoisted
him
to
his
feet
gripped
him
held
him
upright
greg
walked
toward
him
stood
facing
him
stutsman
he
said
you
have
four
hours
of
air
that
will
give
you
four
hours
to
think
to
make
your
peace
with
death
he
turned
toward
the
other
two
chambers
nodded
grimly
craven
said
nothing
and
now
said
greg
to
craven
if
you
will
fasten
down
his
helmet
the
helmet
clanged
shut
shutting
out
the
pleas
and
threats
that
came
from
stutsman
throat
stutsman
saw
distant
stars
cruel
gleaming
eyes
that
glared
at
him
empty
space
fell
away
on
all
sides
numbed
by
fear
he
realized
where
he
was
manning
had
picked
him
up
and
thrown
him
far
into
space
out
into
that
waste
where
for
hundreds
of
light
years
there
was
only
the
awful
nothingness
of
space
he
was
less
than
a
speck
of
dust
in
this
great
immensity
of
emptiness
there
was
no
up
or
down
no
means
of
orientation
loneliness
and
terror
closed
in
on
him
a
terrible
agony
of
fear
in
four
hours
his
air
would
be
gone
and
then
he
would
die
his
body
would
swirl
and
eddy
through
this
great
cosmic
ocean
it
would
never
be
found
it
would
remain
here
embalmed
by
the
cold
of
space
until
the
last
clap
of
eternity
there
was
one
way
the
easy
way
his
hand
reached
up
and
grasped
the
connection
between
his
helmet
and
the
air
tank
one
wrench
and
he
would
die
swiftly
quickly
instead
of
letting
death
stalk
him
through
the
darkness
for
the
next
four
hours
he
shivered
and
his
hand
loosened
its
hold
dropped
away
he
was
afraid
to
hasten
death
he
wanted
to
put
it
off
he
was
afraid
of
death
horribly
afraid
the
stars
mocked
him
and
he
seemed
to
hear
hooting
laughter
from
somewhere
far
away
curiously
it
sounded
like
his
own
laughter
i
make
it
easy
for
you
manning
chambers
said
i
know
that
all
of
us
are
guilty
guilty
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
and
the
law
guilty
in
your
eyes
if
we
had
won
there
would
have
been
no
penalty
never
a
penalty
for
the
one
who
wins
penalty
said
greg
his
eyes
half
smiling
why
yes
i
think
there
is
i
going
to
order
you
aboard
the
for
something
to
eat
and
to
get
some
rest
you
mean
to
say
that
we
are
prisoners
greg
shook
his
head
not
prisoners
he
said
why
i
came
out
here
to
guide
you
back
to
earth
i
hauled
you
out
here
and
got
you
into
this
jam
it
was
up
to
me
to
get
you
out
of
it
i
would
have
done
the
same
for
stutsman
too
but
he
hesitated
and
looked
at
chambers
chambers
stared
back
and
slowly
nodded
yes
manning
he
said
i
think
i
understand
chambers
lit
his
cigar
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
i
wish
you
could
see
it
my
way
manning
he
said
there
no
place
for
me
on
earth
no
place
for
me
in
the
solar
system
you
see
i
tried
and
failed
i
just
a
back
there
he
laughed
quietly
somehow
i
ca
imagine
myself
coming
back
in
the
role
of
the
defeated
tribal
leader
chained
to
your
chariot
so
to
speak
but
it
would
be
that
way
protested
greg
your
company
is
gone
true
and
your
stocks
are
worthless
but
you
have
lost
everything
you
still
have
a
fleet
of
ships
with
our
new
power
the
solar
system
will
especially
need
ships
lots
of
ships
for
the
spacelanes
will
be
filled
with
commerce
you
be
coming
back
to
a
new
deal
a
new
solar
system
a
place
that
has
been
transformed
almost
overnight
by
power
that
practically
free
yes
yes
i
know
all
that
said
chambers
but
i
climbed
too
high
i
got
too
big
i
ca
come
back
now
as
something
small
a
failure
you
have
things
we
need
said
greg
the
screen
that
blankets
out
our
television
and
for
example
we
need
your
screen
as
a
safeguard
against
the
very
thing
we
have
created
think
of
what
criminal
uses
could
be
made
of
the
no
vault
no
net
of
charged
wires
nothing
could
stop
a
thief
from
taking
anything
he
wanted
prisons
would
cease
to
be
prisons
criminals
could
reach
in
and
pick
up
their
friends
no
matter
how
many
guards
there
were
prisons
and
bank
vaults
and
national
treasuries
could
be
cleaned
out
in
a
single
day
then
there
the
space
fields
added
russ
ruefully
those
almost
got
us
if
i
had
thought
of
moving
the
televisor
through
time
we
would
have
had
to
pull
stakes
and
run
for
it
no
you
would
pointed
out
craven
you
could
have
wiped
us
out
in
a
moment
you
can
disintegrate
matter
send
it
up
in
a
puff
of
smoke
rip
every
electron
apart
and
send
it
hurtling
away
of
course
we
could
have
craven
said
greg
but
we
would
chambers
laughed
softly
not
quite
mad
enough
at
us
to
do
that
eh
greg
looked
at
him
i
guess
that
must
have
been
it
but
i
curious
about
the
green
space
fields
persisted
russ
simple
said
craven
they
were
just
fields
that
had
more
energy
packed
into
a
certain
portion
of
space
than
space
could
take
space
fields
that
had
far
more
than
their
share
of
energy
more
than
they
could
hold
a
solution
will
crystalize
almost
immediately
onto
the
tiniest
crystal
put
into
it
those
fields
acted
the
same
way
they
crystalized
instantly
into
the
moment
they
came
into
contact
with
other
energy
whether
as
photons
of
radiation
matter
or
other
space
fields
your
did
stand
a
chance
under
those
conditions
when
they
crystalized
they
took
a
chunk
of
the
field
along
with
them
a
small
chunk
but
one
after
another
they
ate
a
hole
right
through
your
screen
something
like
that
would
have
a
commercial
value
said
greg
useful
in
war
too
and
now
that
mankind
has
taken
to
space
now
that
spreading
out
we
must
think
of
possible
attack
there
must
be
life
on
other
planets
throughout
the
galaxy
someday
they
come
if
they
do
someday
we
go
to
them
and
we
may
need
every
type
of
armament
we
can
get
our
hands
on
chambers
knocked
the
ash
off
his
cigar
and
was
staring
out
the
vision
port
the
ship
had
swung
so
that
through
the
port
could
be
seen
the
distant
star
toward
which
the
had
been
driving
for
my
part
said
chambers
slowly
measuring
each
word
you
can
have
those
findings
of
ours
we
give
them
to
you
knowing
you
will
use
them
as
they
should
be
used
craven
can
tell
you
how
they
work
that
is
if
craven
wants
to
he
is
the
man
who
developed
them
certainly
said
craven
they
be
something
to
remember
us
by
but
you
are
coming
back
with
us
are
you
asked
greg
craven
shook
his
head
no
i
going
with
chambers
i
do
know
what
he
thinking
of
but
whatever
it
is
it
all
right
with
me
we
been
together
too
long
i
miss
someone
to
fight
with
chambers
was
still
staring
out
the
vision
port
he
was
talking
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
talking
to
them
i
had
a
dream
you
see
i
saw
the
people
struggling
against
the
inefficiency
and
stupidity
of
popular
government
i
saw
the
periodic
rise
of
bad
leaders
i
saw
them
lead
the
people
into
blunders
i
read
history
and
i
saw
that
since
the
time
man
had
risen
from
the
ape
this
had
been
going
on
so
i
proposed
to
give
the
people
scientific
government
a
business
administration
an
administration
that
would
have
run
the
government
exactly
as
a
successful
businessman
runs
his
business
the
people
would
have
resented
it
if
i
had
told
them
they
did
know
how
to
run
their
affairs
there
was
only
one
way
to
do
it
gain
control
and
force
it
down
their
throats
chambers
was
no
longer
a
beaten
man
no
longer
a
man
with
a
white
bandage
around
his
head
and
his
power
stripped
from
him
once
again
he
was
the
fighting
financier
who
had
sat
back
at
the
desk
in
the
interplanetary
building
on
earth
and
issued
orders
orders
that
sped
across
millions
of
miles
of
space
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
they
did
want
it
man
does
want
to
live
under
scientific
government
he
does
want
to
be
protected
against
blunders
he
wants
what
he
calls
freedom
the
right
to
do
the
things
he
wants
to
do
even
if
it
means
making
a
damn
fool
of
himself
the
right
to
rise
to
great
heights
and
tumble
to
equally
low
depths
that
human
nature
and
i
ruled
it
out
but
you
ca
rule
out
human
nature
they
sat
in
silence
no
one
speaking
russ
cupped
his
pipe
bowl
in
his
hand
and
watched
chambers
chambers
leaned
back
and
slowly
puffed
at
the
cigar
greg
just
sat
his
face
unchanging
craven
finally
broke
the
silence
just
what
are
you
planning
to
do
chambers
flicked
his
hand
toward
the
distant
sun
that
gleamed
through
the
vision
port
there
a
new
solar
system
out
there
he
said
new
worlds
a
new
sun
a
place
to
start
over
again
you
and
i
discovered
it
it
ours
by
right
of
discovery
we
go
there
and
stake
out
our
claim
but
there
may
be
nothing
there
protested
greg
that
sun
is
younger
than
our
sun
the
planets
may
not
have
cooled
as
yet
life
may
not
have
developed
in
such
a
case
said
chambers
we
shall
find
another
planetary
system
around
another
sun
a
system
that
has
cooled
where
there
is
life
russ
gasped
here
was
something
important
something
that
should
set
a
precedent
the
first
men
to
roam
from
star
to
star
seeking
new
worlds
the
first
men
to
turn
their
backs
on
the
old
solar
system
and
strike
out
in
search
of
new
worlds
swinging
in
their
paths
around
distant
suns
greg
was
saying
all
right
if
that
the
way
you
want
it
i
was
hoping
you
come
back
with
us
but
we
help
you
repair
your
ship
we
give
you
all
the
supplies
we
can
spare
russ
rose
to
his
feet
that
he
said
calls
for
a
little
drink
he
opened
a
cabinet
and
took
out
bottles
and
glasses
only
three
said
chambers
craven
does
drink
craven
interrupted
pour
one
for
me
too
page
chambers
looked
at
the
scientist
astounded
i
never
knew
you
to
take
a
drink
in
your
life
craven
twisted
his
face
into
a
grin
this
is
a
special
occasion
the
was
nearing
mars
heading
for
earth
which
was
still
a
greenish
sphere
far
to
one
side
of
the
flaming
sun
russ
watched
the
little
green
globe
thinking
earth
was
home
to
him
it
always
would
be
home
but
that
would
be
changed
soon
just
a
few
more
generations
and
to
millions
upon
millions
of
human
beings
earth
no
longer
would
be
home
with
the
new
material
energy
engines
life
on
every
planet
would
be
possible
now
even
easy
the
cost
of
manufacture
mining
shipping
across
the
vast
distances
between
the
planets
would
be
only
a
fraction
of
what
it
had
been
when
man
had
been
forced
to
rely
upon
the
unwieldy
expensive
accumulator
system
of
supplying
power
now
mars
would
have
power
of
her
own
even
pluto
could
generate
her
own
and
power
was
well
it
was
power
the
power
to
live
the
power
to
work
to
establish
and
maintain
commerce
to
adjust
gravity
to
earth
standard
or
to
any
standard
the
power
to
remake
and
reshape
and
rebuild
planetary
conditions
to
suit
man
exactly
earthmen
and
earthwomen
would
be
moving
out
en
masse
now
to
the
new
and
virgin
fields
of
endeavor
to
the
farms
of
venus
to
the
manufacturing
centers
that
were
springing
up
on
mars
to
the
mines
of
the
jovian
worlds
to
the
great
laboratory
plants
that
would
spring
up
on
titan
and
on
pluto
and
on
the
other
colder
worlds
the
migration
of
races
had
started
long
ago
in
the
old
stone
age
the
had
swept
out
of
nowhere
to
oust
the
neanderthal
centuries
later
the
barbarians
of
the
north
in
another
of
those
restless
migrations
had
overwhelmed
and
swept
away
the
roman
empire
and
many
centuries
later
migration
had
turned
from
europe
to
a
new
world
across
the
sea
and
fighting
americans
had
battled
their
way
from
east
to
west
conquering
a
continent
and
now
another
great
migration
was
on
man
was
leaving
the
earth
moving
into
space
he
was
leaving
behind
him
the
world
that
had
reared
and
fostered
him
he
was
striking
out
and
out
first
the
planets
would
be
overrun
and
then
man
would
leap
from
the
planets
to
the
stars
for
years
after
america
had
become
a
country
had
built
a
tradition
of
her
own
europe
was
regarded
by
millions
as
the
homeland
but
as
the
years
swept
by
this
had
ceased
to
be
and
the
americas
were
a
world
unto
themselves
owing
nothing
to
europe
and
that
was
the
way
it
would
be
with
earth
for
centuries
for
thousands
of
years
earth
would
be
the
mother
planet
the
homeland
for
all
the
millions
of
roaming
men
and
women
who
dared
the
gulfs
of
space
and
the
strangeness
of
new
worlds
there
would
be
trips
back
to
the
earth
for
sentimental
reasons
to
see
the
place
where
one
ancestors
were
born
and
had
lived
to
goggle
at
the
monument
which
marked
the
point
from
which
the
first
spaceship
had
taken
off
for
the
moon
to
visit
old
museums
and
see
old
cities
and
breathe
the
air
that
men
and
women
had
breathed
for
thousands
of
years
before
they
found
the
power
to
take
them
anywhere
in
the
end
earth
would
be
just
a
planet
even
now
her
minerals
were
rapidly
being
exhausted
her
oil
wells
were
dry
and
all
her
coal
was
mined
her
industry
stabilized
and
filled
her
businesses
interlocking
and
highly
competitive
a
world
that
was
too
full
that
had
too
many
things
too
many
activities
too
many
people
a
world
that
did
need
men
and
women
a
world
where
even
genius
was
kept
from
rising
to
the
top
and
this
was
what
was
driving
mankind
away
from
the
earth
the
competition
the
crowded
conditions
in
business
and
industrial
fields
the
lack
of
opportunity
for
new
development
the
everlasting
struggle
to
get
ahead
fighting
for
a
place
to
live
when
millions
of
others
were
fighting
for
the
same
thing
but
not
entirely
that
not
that
alone
there
was
something
else
that
old
adventuresome
spirit
the
driving
urge
to
face
new
dangers
to
step
over
old
frontiers
to
do
and
dare
to
make
a
damn
fool
of
one
self
or
to
surpass
the
greatest
accomplishments
of
history
but
earth
would
never
die
for
there
was
a
part
of
earth
in
every
man
and
woman
who
would
go
forth
into
space
part
of
earth
courage
part
of
earth
ideals
part
of
earth
dreams
the
habits
and
the
virtues
and
the
faults
that
earth
had
spawned
and
fostered
these
were
things
that
would
never
die
old
earth
would
live
forever
even
when
she
was
drifting
dust
and
the
sun
was
a
dead
cold
star
earth
would
live
on
in
the
courage
and
the
dreams
that
by
that
time
would
be
spreading
to
the
far
corners
of
the
galaxy
russ
dug
the
pipe
out
of
his
pocket
searched
for
the
pouch
found
it
on
the
desk
behind
him
it
was
empty
hell
he
said
my
tobacco
all
gone
greg
grinned
you
wo
have
to
wait
long
we
be
back
on
earth
in
a
few
more
hours
russ
put
the
stem
between
his
teeth
bit
down
on
it
savagely
i
guess
that
right
i
can
dry
smoke
her
until
we
get
there
earth
was
larger
now
mars
had
swung
astern
suddenly
a
winking
light
stabbed
out
into
space
from
the
night
side
of
earth
signaling
signaling
clearing
the
spacelanes
for
a
greater
future
than
any
human
prophet
had
ever
predicted
the
end
